01:49.654 --> 01:50.951
The tank itself...

01:51.022 --> 01:53.149
...was unusual in that it was vertical...

01:53.591 --> 01:55.684
...and looked like an old boiler.

01:56.260 --> 01:58.558
inside the tank the subject wore
a heavy glass bubble...

01:58.629 --> 02:02.292
...and you would have thought the whole
contraption uncomfortable to say the least.

02:02.366 --> 02:03.833
it was, however, effective.

02:04.602 --> 02:08.264
of the 23 students tested,
only two found the experience unpleasant.

02:08.872 --> 02:10.863
Some even called it exhilarating.

02:10.941 --> 02:13.136
A number of students hallucinated.

02:13.977 --> 02:17.640
Dr. Jessup found the encephalographic
evidence especially interesting.

02:17.847 --> 02:20.975
And one Saturday afternoon, in April 1967...

02:21.051 --> 02:23.747
...he decided to try the experience
for himself.

03:52.073 --> 03:54.564
Arthur. Hey, Arthur.

03:55.576 --> 03:56.838
Are you there?

03:57.645 --> 03:59.078
Can you hear me, Arthur?

04:01.249 --> 04:02.682
Arthur, answer me.

04:03.985 --> 04:06.852
Is that it? You want me
to come in and get you out?

04:10.625 --> 04:12.786
i want to get a look at those EEG tracings.

05:03.642 --> 05:04.904
How do you feel?

05:05.277 --> 05:06.539
Not bad.

05:06.912 --> 05:08.903
I hallucinated like a son of a bitch.

05:09.415 --> 05:12.077
A variety of dream states,
mystical states...

05:12.718 --> 05:14.913
...a lot of religious allegory,
mostly out of Revelation.

05:14.987 --> 05:17.148
You were in there close to five hours.

05:17.390 --> 05:18.414
It felt like an hour.

05:18.491 --> 05:20.152
I'd like to try that myself sometime.

05:20.226 --> 05:21.750
You should. You'll like it.

05:25.498 --> 05:27.227
Did we have any communication?

05:27.566 --> 05:30.194
Sure. I kept checking you out
like you told me to.

05:30.970 --> 05:32.267
How did I respond?

05:33.172 --> 05:35.663
Very orderly.
At one point you were crying.

05:36.075 --> 05:37.302
You mean, actually crying?

05:37.375 --> 05:39.809
You were sobbing.
There were tears on your face.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.206
When I asked you what was going on,
you said you were...

05:43.281 --> 05:45.408
...re-experiencing your father's death.

05:47.852 --> 05:49.012
Did you make notes?

05:49.421 --> 05:50.615
It's all there.

05:51.089 --> 05:55.492
I'd like to try this again next week. Do you
think you could make it again next week?

05:55.894 --> 05:57.361
What are we looking for?

05:58.296 --> 06:00.821
I don't know, yet.

06:02.934 --> 06:05.767
There's really very little literature
on this kind of research.

06:05.837 --> 06:08.829
There are some good people in the field:
Tart, Ornstein and Deikman...

06:08.907 --> 06:12.138
...but most of it is radical-hip stuff,
drug-culture apologias.

06:12.710 --> 06:16.077
Obviously, the first thing to do is
set up some sensible methodology...

06:16.147 --> 06:19.172
...study these experiences
under controlled laboratory conditions.

06:19.249 --> 06:21.581
It won't interfere with the work
we're doing with Hobart.

06:21.652 --> 06:25.053
What are we getting into?
Sensory deprivation? Isolation studies?

06:25.122 --> 06:27.556
I mean, where will we be going
with the tank stuff?

06:27.624 --> 06:30.422
We're not writing up a grant.
Strictly bootlegging, just for kicks.

06:30.494 --> 06:32.553
We've got the use of this tank.
Let's play with it.

06:32.629 --> 06:34.529
Let's find out where it takes us.

06:35.866 --> 06:38.494
It's fascinating stuff.
I think we ought to get into it.

06:40.704 --> 06:44.299
I didn't even know they had one of those
isolation tanks at New York Hospital.

06:44.374 --> 06:46.342
Must be some guy
in the Psychology Department...

06:46.410 --> 06:48.241
...doing sensory deprivation studies.

06:49.313 --> 06:51.247
What's Jessup doing with it?

06:51.915 --> 06:55.817
You've got me. He's been taking students
out of his classes and testing them.

06:55.886 --> 06:58.116
He's been doing this for three, four months.

06:58.622 --> 06:59.646
Did you know...

07:00.723 --> 07:02.054
...Jessup was into this kind of stuff?

07:02.124 --> 07:03.716
Not until you just told me.

07:04.327 --> 07:05.351
What do you want?

07:05.428 --> 07:07.487
How long are you going to let it ring?

07:08.564 --> 07:09.758
It's okay, I'll get it.

07:10.132 --> 07:11.724
He's the last guy in the world I figured...

07:11.801 --> 07:15.931
...to be screwing around with anything
as flaky as altered states of consciousness.

07:16.005 --> 07:19.168
Let's face it.
Jessup is pretty flaky himself.

07:21.677 --> 07:22.803
That's him.

07:43.398 --> 07:46.492
Arthur says you're very shy.
He wants me to draw you out.

07:47.202 --> 07:49.466
Draw me out?
That doesn't sound like Arthur.

07:49.938 --> 07:53.374
Well, what he actually said was
you were a high-handed, arrogant prick.

07:53.842 --> 07:55.503
A little nuts, but brilliant...

07:55.810 --> 07:59.109
...and that if I ever got you talking,
I would find you fascinating.

07:59.414 --> 08:01.109
That sounds more like Arthur.

08:01.182 --> 08:04.447
He says you're doing some work with him
and Alan Hobart at Payne-Whitney.

08:04.519 --> 08:05.679
What sort of work?

08:06.655 --> 08:07.781
Toxic metabolite stuff.

08:07.856 --> 08:09.983
We're replicating Heath's
and Friedhoff's strategies...

08:10.058 --> 08:12.720
...trying to find maverick substances
specific to schizophrenia.

08:12.794 --> 08:15.058
I think we're chasing our tails.
What do you do?

08:15.130 --> 08:17.826
I'm a physical anthropologist.
I'm sweating out my dissertation.

08:17.899 --> 08:18.729
Where?

08:19.034 --> 08:19.966
Columbia.

08:20.035 --> 08:21.935
Holloway, and that bunch.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.960
You're kind of young for a Ph. D.,
aren't you?

08:25.039 --> 08:26.028
I'm 24.

08:26.407 --> 08:27.499
That's still pretty good.

08:27.575 --> 08:31.807
I didn't get my Ph. D. until I was 25.
I'm supposed to be a whiz kid.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.380
I'm a whiz kid, too.

08:39.385 --> 08:42.822
Anthropology seems to attract
good-looking women.

08:44.792 --> 08:49.456
So you don't think schizophrenia can be
reduced to a single etiological agent?

08:50.397 --> 08:52.297
I'm not even sure it's a disease.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.533
You think madness is simply
another state of consciousness?

08:55.603 --> 08:58.003
There's a body of evidence to support that.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.307
You don't like to talk
about your work, do you?

09:02.376 --> 09:03.502
As a rule, no.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.984
I'm interested in interior experiences,
especially the religious experience.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.350
The only reason I'm working
with schizophrenics now...

09:15.421 --> 09:19.016
...is the religious experience is
so significant in schizophrenia.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.350
There's only so much
you can do with animals.

09:21.427 --> 09:22.485
I worked with monkeys...

09:22.562 --> 09:24.962
...but they can't tell you what goes on
in their consciousness.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.931
You need human beings for that.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.794
You can't ablate human beings,
nor stick electrodes in their skulls...

09:30.870 --> 09:33.202
...so I have to use
a trance-inducing technique...

09:33.272 --> 09:36.105
...and the isolation tank seemed
the least risky.

09:36.175 --> 09:39.941
And I'd like to go home with you tonight.
Would that be all right with you?

09:40.813 --> 09:44.010
I've got a roommate.
We'll be confined to the living-room couch.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.510
What's wrong with the living-room couch?

09:47.753 --> 09:49.550
You tend to slip off a lot.

09:50.922 --> 09:52.321
I'm sure we'll manage.

09:52.958 --> 09:54.220
I'm sure we will.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.726
So, whenever you want to go there,
you let me know.

10:02.734 --> 10:04.031
How about right now?

10:19.518 --> 10:21.315
What are you thinking about?

10:21.620 --> 10:22.609
God...

10:24.923 --> 10:26.254
...Jesus, crucifixions.

10:29.960 --> 10:34.988
As a rule, do you usually think about
Christ and crucifixions under sexual stress?

10:42.206 --> 10:44.697
When I was nine years old,
I used to see visions...

10:45.843 --> 10:48.903
...visions of saints and angels,
even Christ himself.

10:52.283 --> 10:54.217
Of course I don't do that anymore...

10:59.123 --> 11:00.681
...not since I was 16.

11:01.892 --> 11:03.416
Were your parents religious?

11:04.395 --> 11:05.362
Anything but.

11:06.330 --> 11:10.129
My father was an aeronautical engineer.
My mother, a clinical psychologist.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.459
What happened?

11:12.035 --> 11:16.062
I mean, how did a little kid who saw
visions of Christ turn into a physiologist...

11:16.139 --> 11:18.403
...teaching at the Cornell Medical College?

11:18.808 --> 11:20.139
I stopped believing.

11:20.410 --> 11:21.434
It was very dramatic.

11:21.511 --> 11:25.641
My father died a protracted
and painful death of cancer.

11:27.951 --> 11:30.476
I was 16 years old
and very fond of my father.

11:30.553 --> 11:33.317
I used to race to the hospital
every day after school...

11:34.457 --> 11:36.584
...and sit in his room doing my homework.

11:37.026 --> 11:38.994
He was very heavily sedated.

11:39.462 --> 11:41.259
The last few weeks he was in coma.

11:45.301 --> 11:47.667
One day I thought
I heard him say something.

11:48.972 --> 11:50.666
I got up and leaned over him...

11:51.240 --> 11:53.367
...my ear an inch away from his lips.

11:54.543 --> 11:56.374
"Did you say something, Pop?"

11:59.348 --> 12:03.079
Then I heard the word he was desperately
trying to say, a soft hiss of a word.

12:03.152 --> 12:04.483
He was saying...

12:08.056 --> 12:09.148
"... terrible..."

12:17.766 --> 12:18.824
"... terrible."

12:22.271 --> 12:25.331
So the end was terrible,
even for the good people like my father.

12:25.407 --> 12:28.399
So the purpose of all our suffering
was just more suffering.

12:31.846 --> 12:35.976
By dinner time, I had dispensed with God
altogether. I never saw another vision.

12:40.454 --> 12:42.888
I haven't told anybody
about this in 10 years.

12:46.127 --> 12:48.687
I'm telling you now
because I want you to know...

12:48.930 --> 12:52.058
...what sort of a nut
you might be getting mixed up with.

12:54.402 --> 12:56.063
Arthur was right.

12:56.771 --> 12:58.636
You are a fascinating bastard.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.680
Well, it's settled.

15:31.755 --> 15:35.521
Metcalfe spoke to Spencer again this
morning and it's definite. The job's mine.

15:35.592 --> 15:38.254
I'll be in Nairobi doing
my post-doc work July and August...

15:38.328 --> 15:40.523
...and in September,
I'll be teaching at Harvard.

15:40.597 --> 15:41.655
Terrific.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.828
It looks like we'll both be teaching
at Harvard in September.

15:45.902 --> 15:47.369
Looks that way.

15:49.506 --> 15:52.134
You can't get any tidier than that, can you?

15:55.145 --> 15:58.875
We're going to be together in Boston
and I think we should get married.

16:01.217 --> 16:04.050
You know, of course,
I'm supposed to be at least a little bit nuts.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.280
A little bit?

16:05.354 --> 16:07.219
You're an unmitigated madman!

16:09.291 --> 16:13.387
You don't have to tell me how weird
you are. I know how weird you are!

16:13.963 --> 16:15.658
I'm the girl in your bed
the past two months.

16:15.731 --> 16:18.495
Even sex is a mystical experience for you.

16:19.235 --> 16:21.795
You carry on like a flagellant,
which can be very nice...

16:21.871 --> 16:24.431
...but I sometimes wonder
if it's me that's being made love to.

16:24.507 --> 16:28.375
I feel like I'm being harpooned by some
raging monk in the act of receiving God.

16:32.381 --> 16:38.047
And you are a Faust freak, Eddie.
You'd sell your soul to find the great Truth.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.712
Well, human life doesn't have great truths.

16:42.223 --> 16:45.886
We're born in doubt. We spend our lives
persuading ourselves we're alive.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.088
And one way we do that is
we love each other, like I love you.

16:49.464 --> 16:51.557
I can't imagine living without you.

16:52.634 --> 16:54.158
So let's get married.

16:54.369 --> 16:56.735
If it turns out to be a disaster,
it'll be a disaster.

16:56.805 --> 16:58.705
We'll shake hands and say goodbye.

17:06.314 --> 17:07.941
He's giving her dimethyltryptamine.

17:08.016 --> 17:11.974
It takes effect in about a minute
and she'll trip out for about half an hour.

17:18.259 --> 17:19.919
Do you feel different now?

17:21.862 --> 17:22.988
Less anxious?

17:24.131 --> 17:25.063
Much less.

17:25.398 --> 17:27.299
Do you have any special feelings?

17:27.568 --> 17:28.660
I feel...

17:29.570 --> 17:32.266
...like my heart is being touched by Christ.

17:48.255 --> 17:51.452
There's a lot of religious delusion
among acute schizophrenics.

17:51.825 --> 17:54.919
Some guys say schizophrenics are
physically different from the rest of us.

17:54.995 --> 17:58.556
It's almost as if they were trying
to change their physical selves to...

17:58.699 --> 18:01.292
...adapt to their schizophrenic image
of themselves.

18:09.542 --> 18:12.602
All right, we'll get married,
since it's that important to you.

18:13.546 --> 18:15.173
I'm not comfortable with women...

18:15.248 --> 18:19.116
...and I'm not likely to find anyone
half as remarkable as you again.

18:20.153 --> 18:22.485
I think I can make
a reasonably good husband.

18:25.057 --> 18:26.854
I don't want to lose you, you see.

18:29.228 --> 18:33.528
I suppose that's the closest thing to
a declaration of love I'll ever get out of you.

18:45.544 --> 18:47.341
Am I really that weird in bed?

18:47.946 --> 18:48.776
Sometimes.

18:51.216 --> 18:52.649
Shall I try to change?

18:53.285 --> 18:54.616
No, I kind of like it.

19:18.877 --> 19:21.437
- Daddy, I'm tired.
- We'll give the little lady a ride!

19:21.513 --> 19:22.878
Hey, Mason, be careful.

19:24.481 --> 19:25.573
How you doin', Eddie?

19:25.649 --> 19:27.276
Hi, Mason. How about a beer?

19:33.157 --> 19:36.957
- If I didn't see this, I wouldn't believe it!
- You were supposed to come next week!

19:49.240 --> 19:52.676
Look at the family man!
Oh, Eddie, you look so good!

19:52.743 --> 19:53.732
I don't believe it.

19:53.811 --> 19:55.972
Not again? When did this happen?

19:56.046 --> 19:57.570
Well, it's a long story.

19:58.249 --> 19:59.716
Have you found a place yet?

19:59.917 --> 20:02.477
We got a nice little place
near Huntington Field.

20:03.187 --> 20:04.882
We moved to San Francisco
seven years ago.

20:04.955 --> 20:06.785
Arthur is going to teach at Boston U.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.355
I can't believe it's been seven years.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.551
I hear you just got associate professor.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.384
You guys must be loaded!

20:12.929 --> 20:15.363
We've got a place in Maine
you can use for the summer.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.922
I'm going to Africa again in June.
Eddie will be in Mexico.

20:18.001 --> 20:20.629
Do you know a guy named Eccheverria,
University of Mexico?

20:20.703 --> 20:21.931
Says he worked with you.

20:22.005 --> 20:23.404
Sure. A very bright young guy.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.237
He's here at the Botanical Museum.
We'll all have to get together.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.709
I'm going back to Mexico with him in June.

20:28.778 --> 20:29.767
What's in Mexico?

20:29.846 --> 20:33.145
Eccheverria's got this witch doctor
down there, the Hinchi Indians.

20:33.449 --> 20:36.043
They're an isolated tribe in Central Mexico
who still practice...

20:36.119 --> 20:39.782
...the ancient Toltec rituals, sacred
mushroom ceremonies, that kind of thing.

20:40.123 --> 20:42.557
Apparently they use some kind
of hallucinatory drug...

20:42.625 --> 20:45.822
...that is supposed to evoke
a common experience in all users.

20:46.862 --> 20:49.990
Maggie has fallen asleep on the couch.
Will you take care of her?

20:51.300 --> 20:53.734
Did you ever get into an isolation tank
since New York?

20:53.802 --> 20:55.133
No. Did you?

20:55.203 --> 20:58.001
No, but I just found out
there's one here at the Medical School.

20:58.073 --> 21:00.940
I didn't think anybody was doing
those kind of studies anymore.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.000
We did some interesting stuff in that tank...

21:03.078 --> 21:05.603
...in New York for the few months
we played around with it.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.650
Maybe when I get back from Mexico
we'll get into it again.

21:08.717 --> 21:09.911
Why not?

21:18.727 --> 21:20.524
A terrific housekeeper she's not.

21:22.764 --> 21:24.664
They're getting a divorce, you know.

21:25.167 --> 21:28.067
- I don't know if they're getting...
- What are you talking about?

21:28.135 --> 21:30.296
She and the kids are moving to Cambridge.

21:30.371 --> 21:31.770
That's why this place is such a mess.

21:31.839 --> 21:34.273
They're moving her stuff
into storage tomorrow.

21:37.912 --> 21:40.380
Then she's going off to Africa
for a year with the kids.

21:40.448 --> 21:42.211
And he's going to Mexico.

21:42.383 --> 21:45.841
When she comes back, she's going
to live in Cambridge and he's staying here.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.581
It's he who wants the divorce, not her.

21:47.655 --> 21:50.021
I'm surprised they stayed together
this long.

21:50.257 --> 21:51.690
When did all this happen?

21:51.759 --> 21:53.693
She just told me five minutes ago.

21:54.028 --> 21:57.395
What about the letters she kept writing us
about how happy they were?

21:57.465 --> 22:00.696
Don't ask me. She's still crazy about him.
He's still crazy.

22:12.345 --> 22:14.870
Sylvia just told me
you're getting a divorce.

22:16.282 --> 22:17.510
We're getting separated.

22:17.584 --> 22:20.610
We probably won't get around
to the divorce until next year.

22:21.121 --> 22:23.783
I know it's none of my business, but why?

22:24.824 --> 22:27.315
You're married to a great woman
who adores you.

22:27.394 --> 22:29.658
My God, if anybody has it made, you have.

22:30.630 --> 22:32.723
You're a respected and admired figure...

22:32.799 --> 22:35.996
...a full professor on the faculty
of the Harvard Medical School.

22:36.202 --> 22:40.662
For God's sake, is that how you imagine
me? A respected and admired figure?

22:41.708 --> 22:43.335
A devoted father? A loving husband?

22:43.410 --> 22:47.176
Well, I've also published nearly two papers
a year for the last seven years...

22:47.247 --> 22:49.841
...and not a fundamental piece of work
in the lot.

22:50.016 --> 22:53.917
I sit around the living rooms
of other young married faculty members...

22:53.986 --> 22:57.615
...talking infantile masturbation, who's
sucking up to the head of the department...

22:57.689 --> 23:00.021
...whose tenure is hanging by a thread.

23:01.260 --> 23:02.887
Emily is content to go on with this life.

23:03.028 --> 23:05.588
She insists she's in love with me,
whatever that is.

23:05.931 --> 23:08.593
What she means is
she prefers the senseless pain...

23:08.667 --> 23:10.225
...we inflict on each other to the pain...

23:10.302 --> 23:12.668
...we would otherwise inflict on ourselves...

23:13.505 --> 23:15.837
...but I'm not afraid of that solitary pain.

23:17.476 --> 23:21.537
If I don't strip myself of all this clatter
and clutter and ridiculous ritual...

23:21.947 --> 23:24.108
...I shall go out of my fucking mind!

23:25.784 --> 23:27.411
Does that answer your question, Arthur?

23:27.486 --> 23:28.885
What question was that?

23:29.021 --> 23:30.886
You asked me why I was getting divorced.

23:30.956 --> 23:32.684
Listen, it's your life.

23:33.191 --> 23:34.522
I'm sorry I even asked.

23:36.961 --> 23:40.522
Why don't I call Eccheverria
and we'll all go out and have some dinner?

23:43.000 --> 23:46.026
As a matter of fact, Eduardo,
my year in India was disappointing.

23:46.103 --> 23:47.570
No matter how you slice it...

23:47.638 --> 23:50.232
...yoga's a state-specific technology
operating in the service of...

23:50.308 --> 23:51.707
...an a piori belief system...

23:51.776 --> 23:55.769
We scientists have a moral obligation to
the public as well as to our own research.

23:56.113 --> 23:57.375
It just never occurred to baboons...

23:57.448 --> 24:01.214
...that they could shorten that time
to five minutes if they used a stick.

24:02.053 --> 24:06.547
Originally, man was just another
savanna-living primate like the baboon.

24:06.657 --> 24:11.560
What dignifies the yogic practices is the
belief system itself is not truly religious.

24:13.463 --> 24:15.328
There is no Buddhist god, per se.

24:15.398 --> 24:20.165
It is the Self, the individual Mind, that
contains immortality and ultimate Truth.

24:20.470 --> 24:22.165
What is not religious about that?

24:22.239 --> 24:24.469
You've simply replaced God
with the original Self.

24:24.541 --> 24:25.735
Yes, but we've localized it.

24:25.809 --> 24:27.868
Now I know where the Self is.
It's in our own minds.

24:27.944 --> 24:31.277
It's a form of human energy.
Our atoms are six billion years old.

24:31.348 --> 24:34.840
We've got six billion years
of memory in our minds.

24:35.318 --> 24:37.980
Memory is energy! It doesn't disappear!
It's still in there!

24:38.054 --> 24:40.921
There's a physiological pathway
to our earlier consciousnesses.

24:40.991 --> 24:44.017
There has to be.
It's in the goddamned limbic system.

24:44.094 --> 24:45.755
Jessup, you're a whacko!

24:46.029 --> 24:48.964
What's whacko about it?
I'm a man in search of his true Self.

24:49.032 --> 24:51.364
How archetypically American can you get?

24:52.068 --> 24:54.127
Everybody's looking for their true selves.

24:54.204 --> 24:56.694
We're all trying to fulfill ourselves...

24:57.206 --> 24:59.674
...understand ourselves,
get in touch with ourselves...

24:59.742 --> 25:04.042
...face the reality of ourselves,
explore ourselves, expand ourselves.

25:04.313 --> 25:05.837
Ever since we dispensed with God...

25:05.915 --> 25:10.045
...we've got nothing but ourselves
to explain this meaningless horror of life.

25:10.219 --> 25:11.345
You're whacko.

25:13.589 --> 25:15.784
Well, I think that the true Self...

25:16.492 --> 25:21.088
...that original Self, that first Self,
is a real, mensurate, quantifiable thing...

25:21.430 --> 25:24.194
...tangible and incarnate...

25:25.434 --> 25:27.402
...and I'm going to find the fucker.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.659
What are their chemical properties?

25:55.496 --> 25:56.485
Are they safe?

25:56.564 --> 26:00.125
The mushrooms are almost
certainly amanita muscaria...

26:00.535 --> 26:04.062
...a very powerful psychedelic
and a little dangerous.

26:04.739 --> 26:07.936
It contains belladonna, alkaloids...

26:08.309 --> 26:10.368
...atropine, scopolamine.

26:11.112 --> 26:13.945
The sinicuiche plant is highly regarded...

26:14.983 --> 26:16.848
...among a number of Indian tribes.

26:16.918 --> 26:18.942
I've seen it as far north as Chihuahua.

26:19.086 --> 26:21.953
The Indians say it evokes old memories...

26:22.889 --> 26:24.516
...event ancient ones...

26:25.459 --> 26:28.622
...and the Hinchis call it The First Flower.

26:30.530 --> 26:32.589
The first in the sense of primordial?

26:32.733 --> 26:33.859
Yes.

26:34.201 --> 26:36.169
In the sense of the most ancient.

26:37.170 --> 26:38.501
I'd like to try it.

26:40.407 --> 26:43.069
Do you think they would
let me join in their ritual?

26:44.277 --> 26:46.541
Well, they seem like agreeable people.

27:00.026 --> 27:03.587
Est todo bien para ti
participar en la ceremonia.

27:05.064 --> 27:08.329
He says it's all right for you
to participate in their ceremony.

27:08.634 --> 27:11.159
Ask him what kind of an experience
I can expect.

27:12.038 --> 27:13.903
Are they gathering these mushrooms
for the ritual?

27:13.973 --> 27:16.168
No, they're being harvested for next year.

27:21.747 --> 27:24.272
Qué clase de experiencia
puede esperar mi amigo?

27:25.017 --> 27:27.577
Su alma regresar a su primera alma.

27:28.254 --> 27:30.518
Your soul will return to the First Soul.

27:31.924 --> 27:33.915
Ask him what this First Soul will look like.

27:33.993 --> 27:35.790
?Cómo es la primera alma?

27:36.562 --> 27:38.530
Es la ateria increada.

27:40.131 --> 27:41.564
It is Unborn Stuff.

27:44.569 --> 27:47.094
Entonces, usted se lanzará en el vacio...

27:48.006 --> 27:50.497
Then you will propel into the void.

27:51.276 --> 27:52.709
Usted verá una mancha.

27:53.178 --> 27:54.668
You will see a spot.

27:55.613 --> 27:57.911
La mancha se convertiráen una grieta.

27:58.783 --> 28:00.580
The spot will become a crack.

28:01.486 --> 28:03.579
Esta es la Grieta Entre la Nada...

28:03.655 --> 28:06.089
This is the Crack Between the Nothing...

28:07.225 --> 28:09.625
De esta Nada saldr su Alma increada.

28:09.894 --> 28:12.988
...and out of this Nothing will come
your Unborn Soul.

29:27.036 --> 29:29.561
Digale que extienda la palma de la mano.

29:30.540 --> 29:34.101
He wants you to hold the root.
Put out your hand with your palm up.

30:44.545 --> 30:45.842
Are you all right?

37:03.414 --> 37:05.678
We only have their word I killed a lizard.

37:06.117 --> 37:08.711
You didn't see it
and I have no recollection of it!

37:09.087 --> 37:11.078
This whole hideous business is
just a joke...

37:11.155 --> 37:14.215
...the Indians have played on me
to make the gringo look like a fool!

37:14.292 --> 37:17.227
Look, you asked me what happened
and I told you!

37:17.895 --> 37:20.158
You drank the mixture
and you went outside.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.192
After a while there was a scream
and some dogs were barking.

37:23.267 --> 37:24.757
I shouted after you.

37:24.968 --> 37:27.562
The screaming stopped.
The brujo yelled at me to come back.

37:27.638 --> 37:28.662
Oh, bullshit!

37:29.673 --> 37:33.268
Then why did you ask the brujo to give you
the mixture to take back to Boston?

37:33.343 --> 37:36.369
I thought I'd like Arthur to analyze,
maybe synthesize, it.

37:39.483 --> 37:41.007
The noise is stupefying.

38:03.272 --> 38:05.331
The sun became black...

38:06.309 --> 38:07.469
...as sack cloth.

38:12.581 --> 38:15.709
The full moon became like blood.

38:18.154 --> 38:20.714
Then a great mountain burning with fire...

38:24.527 --> 38:26.324
...was thrown into the sea.

38:32.868 --> 38:36.599
Then the beast ascends
from the bottomless pit.

38:37.273 --> 38:41.004
The angel of the bottomless pit.
His name is...

38:48.416 --> 38:49.508
...Abaddon.

38:50.919 --> 38:52.011
He's off the wall!

38:52.187 --> 38:53.176
Are you okay?

38:53.254 --> 38:55.279
Get this stuff! It's new!

38:55.924 --> 38:58.290
It's deafening! The noise is deafening!

38:59.561 --> 39:01.392
Can you hear me above this noise?

39:03.665 --> 39:05.030
The most unbelievable thing I've seen!

39:05.100 --> 39:06.965
I'm watching the birth agony
of a mountain!

39:09.604 --> 39:10.730
Oh, my God.

39:10.839 --> 39:12.170
Are you okay?

39:13.675 --> 39:16.872
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

39:17.112 --> 39:19.046
Do you want me to bring you down now?

39:22.584 --> 39:23.572
What happens now?

39:23.650 --> 39:26.881
He's blacked out.
These blackouts can get pretty freaky.

39:26.954 --> 39:28.888
Sometimes they last as long as four hours.

39:28.956 --> 39:32.517
When he comes out of it, he's as chipper
as a bird, but he doesn't remember a thing.

39:32.593 --> 39:35.585
Just how dangerous is this stuff
he brought back from Mexico?

39:35.662 --> 39:37.653
I didn't say dangerous,
just said it was weird.

39:37.731 --> 39:38.823
It hangs around too long...

39:38.899 --> 39:42.027
...and what's really screwy is
it heads straight for the brain.

39:42.636 --> 39:44.194
Well, I don't believe this.

39:45.072 --> 39:48.405
You guys are shooting up with an untested
drug that stacks up in the brain...

39:48.475 --> 39:51.569
...and works in the nucleus of the cell
and you don't call that dangerous?

39:51.645 --> 39:54.637
For the record, we don't actually shoot up.

39:55.082 --> 39:57.346
- Eddie drinks a 10-milligram...
- It will stop now!

39:57.418 --> 39:59.579
You guys are supposed to be
reputable scientists...

39:59.653 --> 40:02.850
...not two kids in the dorm freaking out
on Mexican mushrooms!

40:04.323 --> 40:07.224
Why do you think I called you for?
Let's see you stop him.

40:14.367 --> 40:15.925
This ain't LSD, goddamnit!

40:16.035 --> 40:18.595
This is no serotonin antagonist
you're drinking!

40:19.005 --> 40:21.769
How many grams of that stuff
you think you've got in you?

40:21.841 --> 40:23.365
Two? Three?

40:24.110 --> 40:26.635
You could be working up
one hell of a case of cancer...

40:26.712 --> 40:28.475
...with all the antimetabolites in you.

40:28.548 --> 40:32.143
The Hinchis have been drinking that stuff
for centuries with no incidence of cancer.

40:32.218 --> 40:33.549
Fuck the Hinchi Indians!

40:33.619 --> 40:35.484
You don't know anything
about those mushrooms!

40:35.555 --> 40:37.318
They seem to have
fantastic staying powers!

40:37.390 --> 40:39.290
We've shot up at least 30 rats
with that stuff.

40:39.358 --> 40:41.292
Some of them have
a whopping load in them...

40:41.360 --> 40:43.828
...and none of them have been
noticeably affected.

40:43.963 --> 40:46.487
Where are we going?
We were going to get something to eat.

40:46.565 --> 40:47.998
Eddie wants to show me an isolation tank.

40:48.066 --> 40:51.797
Isolation tank! You guys get flakier
every time I talk to you!

40:51.970 --> 40:54.768
I thought all that isolation tank stuff
went out in the '60s...

40:54.840 --> 40:56.967
...with Timothy Leary
and all them other gurus!

40:57.042 --> 41:00.068
Will you shut up for a minute
and let somebody else say something?

41:00.145 --> 41:01.942
What happens during
these blackout periods is...

41:02.013 --> 41:04.072
...you get the feeling
of phenomenal acceleration...

41:04.149 --> 41:07.277
...like you're being shot out over millions,
billions of years.

41:07.352 --> 41:08.944
Time simply obliterates.

41:09.354 --> 41:12.187
You sense the hallucination is going on,
but you get no images.

41:12.257 --> 41:14.054
I want to break through
that blackout barrier.

41:14.125 --> 41:17.959
I want to know what those images are
that I know are going on but I can't see.

41:18.029 --> 41:21.465
We can't raise the dosage of the drug
because we're close to toxic levels now.

41:21.533 --> 41:23.865
The only way to intensify
the experience is...

41:23.935 --> 41:25.869
...to take the 200 milligrams
along with the tank.

41:25.937 --> 41:28.666
There's more I'd like to do to that drug
before you take it again.

41:28.739 --> 41:30.206
I'd like to do a half-life determination.

41:30.274 --> 41:32.037
- That would take us a year!
- I'd like to know the transport system.

41:32.109 --> 41:33.701
I'd like to find some analogues.

41:33.777 --> 41:36.405
This Mexican stuff
is an extraordinary substance...

41:36.480 --> 41:39.677
...and every instinct I have tells me
I'm onto something hot here...

41:39.750 --> 41:42.742
...and another 200 milligrams
isn't going to kill anybody.

41:45.022 --> 41:46.148
There it is.

41:50.127 --> 41:51.321
Oh, it's horizontal.

41:53.397 --> 41:55.627
It's smaller than the one
we had in New York.

41:57.001 --> 41:58.798
If they're doing sleep studies, it must be...

41:58.869 --> 42:02.464
I don't think anybody's used it in years,
but I checked it out yesterday and it works.

42:02.540 --> 42:03.973
It won't take a week
to get this place cleaned.

42:04.041 --> 42:05.008
You could get your ass in a sling...

42:05.075 --> 42:07.805
...if it ever gets out you're using
an untested drug on human subjects.

42:07.878 --> 42:09.970
Don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to me.

42:10.146 --> 42:11.204
Let's get a quick hamburger.

42:11.281 --> 42:12.680
I'm seeing one of my students tonight.

42:12.749 --> 42:13.681
All right!

42:14.984 --> 42:18.420
Do what you want to do.
I think you're both irresponsible as hell!

42:18.788 --> 42:22.656
Don't call me and tell me you're worried
about Eddie putting all this shit into him!

42:22.725 --> 42:25.785
I'm telling you, don't you put
any more of that shit into him...

42:25.862 --> 42:27.955
...until you know a hell of a lot more
about it!

42:28.031 --> 42:31.057
I've offered you the use of my lab
and all the rats you can cut!

42:31.134 --> 42:33.967
That's as much as I want to be implicated
in your dumb experiments!

42:34.037 --> 42:35.163
Go get your own dumb hamburger.

42:35.238 --> 42:38.002
I've already got my own date
I'm an hour late for!

42:50.118 --> 42:53.110
I already did these first three.
You do the rest.

43:03.865 --> 43:05.492
Couldn't resist, right?

43:05.601 --> 43:08.570
Well, somebody's got to keep his eye
on you two sorcerers.

43:09.705 --> 43:11.798
What have you got in there,
some kind of salt solution?

43:11.873 --> 43:15.240
Ten percent magnesium sulfate,
for buoyancy.

43:18.180 --> 43:19.306
Weird, man.

43:27.522 --> 43:28.955
One, two, three, four.

43:29.291 --> 43:30.451
one, two, three, four.

43:30.525 --> 43:31.684
Okay, you're fine.

43:32.793 --> 43:36.285
Wednesday, January 7th, 4:28 P. M.

43:37.832 --> 43:39.299
Hey, this is terrific!

43:42.036 --> 43:44.664
He went into theta like a shot.
No spindling, nothing.

43:45.606 --> 43:47.301
Grasslands, savannas.

43:49.510 --> 43:50.943
i feel...

43:51.312 --> 43:54.110
...i am actually alive
and inside this landscape.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.309
A density of woodlands about a mile away.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.378
Beyond that,
mountains that seem to be smoking.

44:01.489 --> 44:04.890
Newly born mountains,
Cenozoic, latter Tertiary.

44:06.961 --> 44:08.588
i'm in an edge-area.

44:08.929 --> 44:11.295
Utter tranquility, but alive.

44:11.365 --> 44:13.889
Life in the trees. Life in the sedge.

44:14.834 --> 44:15.892
oh, my God...

44:16.236 --> 44:19.535
...the birth of man. That's got to be it!

44:20.106 --> 44:22.472
y God! There it is...

44:24.177 --> 44:25.144
...a proto-human.

44:25.211 --> 44:28.544
The first, and the original
truly human form...

44:29.983 --> 44:33.111
...tiny, perhaps 4 feet high,
completely furred...

44:33.720 --> 44:35.585
...chimp-like, but erect.

44:35.655 --> 44:37.247
No knuckle walking. Shorter arms.

44:37.323 --> 44:39.587
He's moving along so gracefully.

44:39.959 --> 44:41.893
There's two, three of them.

44:43.596 --> 44:47.327
Bipedal, tiny, little furred
humanoid creatures...

44:47.400 --> 44:49.732
...a chunk of lava in their hands...

44:51.404 --> 44:53.269
...stalking or hunting something.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.832
For Christ's sake.

44:58.510 --> 44:59.670
Are you okay, Eddie?

44:59.745 --> 45:02.942
i'm becoming one of them.
i'm no longer observing.

45:04.650 --> 45:05.810
i'm one of them.

45:10.289 --> 45:13.190
Killing something, a goat.

45:13.459 --> 45:14.824
i'm killing...

45:15.427 --> 45:16.587
...i'm eating...

45:16.962 --> 45:20.363
...i'm eating the blood, hot flesh of a goat.

45:26.939 --> 45:28.065
Are you okay?

45:29.274 --> 45:30.206
Beautiful.

45:31.777 --> 45:33.335
Do you want to come down?

45:47.825 --> 45:50.225
It sounded like he was having
a bad trip to me.

45:50.328 --> 45:52.888
Some of these tank trips can get
pretty creepy.

45:55.733 --> 45:57.223
What the hell was that?

46:01.339 --> 46:02.328
Are you okay?

46:03.307 --> 46:04.274
Beautiful.

46:04.876 --> 46:06.366
Do you want to stop this?

46:06.911 --> 46:09.812
- Do you want me to leave you alone?
- Yeah.

46:26.897 --> 46:29.627
I thought you said these things don't last
more than four hours.

46:29.699 --> 46:31.098
It's a quarter to nine.

46:31.334 --> 46:32.460
He's coming out.

46:34.805 --> 46:38.571
I don't like being out of contact
for these long periods of time.

46:49.352 --> 46:50.341
I think he's in shock.

46:50.420 --> 46:53.116
He must have had a seizure,
hit his head or something.

47:55.683 --> 47:57.480
What do you want blood tests for?

47:58.753 --> 47:59.811
What does he say?

47:59.888 --> 48:02.015
"Buccal smear, blood for a karyotype...

48:02.090 --> 48:04.251
"... also pictures for the Goodman
and Sarich lab.

48:04.325 --> 48:06.885
"Picture of my neck. Now, before I...

48:07.562 --> 48:08.586
"... reconstitute."

48:08.663 --> 48:09.789
Before he what?

48:10.765 --> 48:12.198
Before he reconstitutes.

48:12.533 --> 48:16.060
Then take his damn blood,
and maybe he'll let me have a look at him.

48:19.908 --> 48:22.273
Do you mind if I examine your neck
for a minute?

48:23.844 --> 48:24.776
Any masses?

48:31.585 --> 48:32.745
Stop talking shit!

48:32.819 --> 48:35.310
Are you trying to say
your dumb hallucination has externalized?

48:35.389 --> 48:36.617
What did he write?

48:36.690 --> 48:38.487
"Not common aphasia.

48:38.558 --> 48:42.085
"Time-space,
fallout from the hallucination."

48:42.162 --> 48:44.255
You are a fucking flake, Jessup.

48:44.364 --> 48:46.127
Get dressed. I'm taking you
to the Brigham...

48:46.199 --> 48:48.030
...and do a complete workup on you.

48:50.337 --> 48:53.033
You are a very sick dude,
you dumb son of a bitch.

48:53.106 --> 48:55.074
I'll look down your throat,
do some skull films...

48:55.142 --> 48:58.168
...get a CAT scan, maybe even
an arteriogram, and I'd like...

48:58.245 --> 49:00.770
...an unbiased eye
to look at those EEG tracings.

49:02.248 --> 49:03.579
What does he say?

49:03.950 --> 49:04.712
"X-ray! "

49:05.484 --> 49:08.749
All right, finish up with him
and let's get him over to X-ray.

49:09.155 --> 49:10.520
Be right back.

49:39.452 --> 49:41.147
is it possible it's purely mechanical?

49:41.220 --> 49:44.120
Well, if it isn't neurological,
it's got to be mechanical.

49:44.522 --> 49:48.686
I'd like some plain films of this guy's neck.
A PA, a lateral and oblique.

49:48.760 --> 49:50.125
I'm backed up to my ass!

49:50.195 --> 49:52.493
Just take the damn pictures!
This is an emergency!

50:12.083 --> 50:13.482
Might be a TIA.

50:14.386 --> 50:16.616
I guess we'd better not tell Eddie he had...

50:17.188 --> 50:21.090
...blood all over his face when he came
out of the tank. He'll claim it was...

50:22.227 --> 50:25.093
...goat's blood from that goat
he was eating in his hallucination.

50:25.162 --> 50:27.630
You know, you're really getting
as weird as he is!

50:27.698 --> 50:29.529
What do you think happened?

50:30.634 --> 50:33.626
He's not the type for hysterical conversion,
so I'm thinking seizure.

50:33.704 --> 50:37.697
He came out of that tank in a fugue state
and had blood all over his face.

50:37.775 --> 50:40.005
He must have had a seizure
while in the tank...

50:40.077 --> 50:43.274
...bit his lip while convulsing
and is postictally aphasic.

50:43.347 --> 50:47.283
I thought maybe he had a vascular insult,
a stroke, a flipped embolus...

50:48.419 --> 50:51.650
...but neurologically he's intact,
so I'm thinking seizure now.

51:04.101 --> 51:06.625
Now you just take it easy.

51:06.702 --> 51:09.227
None of us are so terrific at reading X-rays.

51:09.539 --> 51:10.699
What are you looking for?

51:10.773 --> 51:13.799
Just put these in an envelope.
Who's reading tonight in Radiology?

51:13.876 --> 51:15.241
Dr. Wissenschaft.

51:18.014 --> 51:20.005
I want someone reliable to look at them.

51:20.083 --> 51:22.051
I'd rather not have everyone
in the Brigham on this.

51:22.118 --> 51:24.518
It's bad enough we've got
this nosy X-ray technician.

51:24.587 --> 51:25.747
Are you all right?

51:25.822 --> 51:28.791
I'm fine. I tried to indicate
this was just a transient thing.

51:28.858 --> 51:31.258
A transient ischemic attack,
that's all it was.

51:31.661 --> 51:34.528
- He's got his voice back.
- It wasn't an ischemic attack!

51:34.730 --> 51:36.595
It wasn't a seizure.
You saw the X-rays, Mason.

51:36.666 --> 51:39.931
There was something anterior to the larynx
that looked like a laryngeal sac.

51:40.002 --> 51:42.562
That's strictly simian.
I obviously regressed...

51:43.072 --> 51:45.506
...to some quasi-simian creature.

51:51.113 --> 51:53.013
I'll show these to someone
who can read them right.

51:53.081 --> 51:55.174
You're reading them wrong. That's all...

51:55.250 --> 51:56.376
...because no one is going to tell me...

51:56.451 --> 51:59.284
...you de-differentiated
your goddamn genetic structure...

51:59.354 --> 52:01.845
...for four goddamn hours
and then reconstituted!

52:02.424 --> 52:05.188
I'm a professor of endocrinology
at the Harvard Medical School!

52:05.260 --> 52:07.990
I'm an attending physician
at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital!

52:08.063 --> 52:09.360
I'm a contributing editor...

52:09.431 --> 52:11.365
...to the American Journal
of Endocrinology!

52:11.433 --> 52:15.494
And I'm a fellow and vice-president of the
Eastern Association of Endocrinologists!

52:15.570 --> 52:17.538
And president of the Journal Club!

52:18.073 --> 52:19.700
And I'm not going to listen
to any more of...

52:19.774 --> 52:24.575
...your cabalistic, quantum,
friggin', dumb, limbo mumbo jumbo!

52:24.980 --> 52:27.210
I'm going to show these to a radiologist!

52:38.859 --> 52:39.848
Do me a favor.

52:39.927 --> 52:42.361
Conclusion, bilateral aspiration pneumonia.

52:42.696 --> 52:46.154
- Do me a favor and take a look at these.
- What's the story in this case?

52:46.734 --> 52:51.398
A 35-year-old white man, acute onset
of aphasia, no history of trauma.

52:52.239 --> 52:53.536
What are you looking for?

52:53.607 --> 52:56.667
It looks to me like the architecture is
somewhat abnormal.

52:59.380 --> 53:00.472
Somewhat?

53:01.882 --> 53:03.577
This guy is a fucking gorilla!

54:13.218 --> 54:14.742
Are you okay, Dr. Jessup?

54:14.920 --> 54:16.012
Yes.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.106
Are you all right, Dr. Jessup?

55:54.818 --> 55:55.875
I'm fine.

56:05.561 --> 56:07.290
I just want to make a few notes.

56:45.533 --> 56:47.433
My God, you look so marvelous!

56:48.636 --> 56:50.194
How have you been, Eddie?

56:50.405 --> 56:51.702
Just fine. You?

56:52.106 --> 56:53.130
Fine.

56:54.075 --> 56:55.133
Look, there's Daddy.

56:55.209 --> 56:57.541
Are you going to drive us
to our new house?

56:58.246 --> 57:00.043
You bet. Depending how nice you are...

57:00.114 --> 57:02.582
...maybe we'll take you
to a Chinese restaurant.

57:04.652 --> 57:07.951
Don't let anybody tell you
baboons aren't occasionally carnivorous.

57:08.322 --> 57:10.483
I observed instances of predation...

57:10.858 --> 57:13.622
...which involved the unmistakable
behavior of hunters.

57:13.694 --> 57:16.629
A pair of baboons killed
the Thomson's gazelle and ate it.

57:16.697 --> 57:18.721
There was even
a rudimentary communication...

57:18.799 --> 57:20.426
...between the two baboons...

57:21.535 --> 57:22.763
...so I've become...

57:22.836 --> 57:25.930
...fascinated with the work being done
on nonverbal communications with apes.

57:26.006 --> 57:29.271
I've been corresponding with the Gardners
at the University of Nevada.

57:29.342 --> 57:32.470
i may just go out and spend
a couple of weeks there this summer.

57:32.646 --> 57:35.342
I've got nothing else to do
except write up my report.

57:35.415 --> 57:38.145
I don't suppose you recorded
any of those baboon sounds?

57:39.019 --> 57:40.384
Of course I did. Why?

57:40.454 --> 57:42.217
I'd like very much to hear them.

57:42.522 --> 57:43.511
Of course.

57:44.758 --> 57:47.124
Mrs. Tally said she'll be here
tomorrow morning at 10:30...

57:47.194 --> 57:49.059
...to help you put everything away.

57:49.696 --> 57:52.927
She wanted to know if you wanted her
to come back to work steady.

57:53.433 --> 57:55.162
i got a letter from ason
about a week ago...

57:55.235 --> 57:57.100
...just before we left Nairobi.

58:01.106 --> 58:03.939
He says you've been working
with a very complex drug...

58:04.009 --> 58:06.000
...which you brought back from Mexico.

58:06.612 --> 58:09.740
It hasn't been thoroughly tested yet
and is dangerous as hell.

58:11.717 --> 58:13.412
What else did Mason write you?

58:14.286 --> 58:18.222
That over the past year you've taken
about two grams of that drug yourself...

58:18.491 --> 58:22.587
...and you had a very unusual instance of
genetic regression about three months ago.

58:23.262 --> 58:25.594
You may have leukemia or lymphoma.

58:27.600 --> 58:30.160
He's been trying to get you
to go for a complete workup...

58:30.236 --> 58:31.999
...but you've refused to go.

58:32.505 --> 58:34.837
He's worried stiff that you're cracking up.

58:35.374 --> 58:37.638
He thinks you're behaving very strangely...

58:38.244 --> 58:41.371
...and he begged me to talk to you
about this when I got back.

58:41.746 --> 58:45.443
Mason is pathologically incapable
of keeping his mouth shut about anything.

58:45.750 --> 58:48.719
- He's a stupid, starched, doctrinaire idiot!
- Mason is a first-rate doctor!

58:48.786 --> 58:50.583
It's not leukemia!

58:53.258 --> 58:55.021
Or any other kind of cancer!

58:55.793 --> 58:59.058
I've let him do a liver-spleen scan on me
and a CAT scan.

58:59.130 --> 59:01.223
I have been probed, scoped and palpated!

59:01.299 --> 59:04.496
He's had a mirror down my throat
or up my ass for the last three months...

59:04.602 --> 59:07.594
...and there is no evidence,
no suggestion whatsoever of cancer!

59:07.672 --> 59:09.264
What else did Mason write you?

59:11.843 --> 59:13.936
Which of these has
the baboon vocalizations on them?

59:14.012 --> 59:15.843
- I'd like to hear them.
- Why?

59:15.914 --> 59:18.508
Did he write you that during
the regression...

59:18.583 --> 59:20.608
...I had an aphasic experience
for about four hours?

59:20.685 --> 59:23.653
The only sounds I could get out were
clicks and grunts.

59:23.720 --> 59:25.745
They sound like the baboon vocalizations
on your tapes.

59:25.822 --> 59:28.290
Mason said you took blood tests
and the lab report showed...

59:28.358 --> 59:30.883
...some characteristics
of simian blood group systems.

59:31.061 --> 59:32.688
They also picked up antigens
specific to man.

59:32.763 --> 59:33.787
I'd like to see that data.

59:33.864 --> 59:37.766
The thing to do is for me to get back
to that isolation tank and try it again!

59:37.834 --> 59:41.201
Let's see if it happens again!
None of us really believes it happened.

59:41.271 --> 59:44.798
After three months, I'm beginning
to wonder if it ever happened myself.

59:44.875 --> 59:47.867
They won't go back to the tank.
Mason's taken over the project.

59:47.945 --> 59:50.709
He's got Arthur up in his lab every day
fractionating rats' brains!

59:50.781 --> 59:54.547
What the hell am I supposed to do
while they're fractionating rats' brains?

59:59.289 --> 01:00:01.416
Everybody thinks your father's going nuts.

01:00:01.491 --> 01:00:03.617
Mommy, when are we going to eat?

01:00:07.163 --> 01:00:08.528
Run along now and play with Grace.

01:00:08.598 --> 01:00:12.591
I am convinced that the regression was
triggered by an act of consciousness.

01:00:12.668 --> 01:00:15.728
When I was in the tank,
I entered another consciousness!

01:00:15.905 --> 01:00:18.738
I became another self,
a more primitive self...

01:00:18.808 --> 01:00:20.901
...and the drug, in some way...

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:25.009
...triggered the externalization
of that other, more primitive self.

01:00:26.382 --> 01:00:27.940
At least look at my data!

01:00:28.017 --> 01:00:29.848
Of course. Would tomorrow afternoon be...

01:00:29.919 --> 01:00:32.911
Don't patronize me!
It's just possible I'm not mad, you know!

01:00:32.989 --> 01:00:35.082
I'm asking you to make
a small quantum jump with me...

01:00:35.157 --> 01:00:37.284
...to accept one deviant concept...

01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:40.960
...that our other states of consciousness
are as real as our waking state...

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:42.554
...and that reality can be externalized!

01:00:42.632 --> 01:00:43.621
You're screaming.

01:00:43.699 --> 01:00:45.188
I get this patronizing shit...

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:47.928
...from Arthur and Mason for three months
and I'm sick of it!

01:00:48.003 --> 01:00:51.837
We've got millions of years stored away
in that computer bank we call our minds!

01:00:51.906 --> 01:00:55.433
We have got trillions of dormant genes
in us, our whole evolutionary past.

01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:57.341
Perhaps I've tapped into that!

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:00.972
I want to get back into that tank
and repeat the experiment.

01:01:01.049 --> 01:01:05.247
The most elementary laboratory behavior!
Repeat the experiment. Confirm it!

01:01:06.221 --> 01:01:08.985
I would like other responsible scientists
with me when I do it!

01:01:09.057 --> 01:01:11.582
I would like a little consensual validation
on this.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.593
We may have demonstrated
a whole new force in nature!

01:01:16.564 --> 01:01:19.965
For God's sake, don't you agree
it merits further investigation?

01:01:20.035 --> 01:01:21.593
I have the tapes, notes and everything.

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:25.037
What time would you like to come
and look at the stuff tomorrow?

01:01:25.806 --> 01:01:27.103
2:00, 2:30.

01:01:29.743 --> 01:01:32.303
I just want to get the girls.
I'll be right back.

01:02:11.718 --> 01:02:14.312
- i'll get it, i'll get it.
- No, no, i will.

01:02:15.688 --> 01:02:18.088
It's 8:30, so get washed
and changed right now...

01:02:18.157 --> 01:02:20.921
...and I want no trouble
from either of you tonight.

01:02:20.993 --> 01:02:22.085
Hello?

01:02:22.595 --> 01:02:24.654
Oh, Mason. Thank you for calling.

01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:26.994
I assume you've spoken to Arthur.

01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:30.428
No, no, I just got back
from dinner with the kids.

01:02:30.837 --> 01:02:33.567
Well, I just don't know what to say.

01:02:33.706 --> 01:02:36.800
I think you're absolutely right.
He's on the verge of a breakdown.

01:02:36.876 --> 01:02:40.505
He was here all afternoon and carried on
like a madman and then just disappeared.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:44.016
Ordinarily I wouldn't be this panicky,
but I just am very worried.

01:04:55.244 --> 01:04:58.270
- What's the trouble?
- There's an animal loose in the basement!

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.011
What kind of animal?

01:05:00.282 --> 01:05:01.579
Monkey, I think!

01:05:25.807 --> 01:05:27.274
Charlie! Charlie Thomas!

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:29.972
Where are you?

01:05:32.281 --> 01:05:34.748
We've got an animal loose
in the B-building basement.

01:05:34.815 --> 01:05:37.306
I'm heading to the north corridor
leading to the boiler room...

01:05:37.385 --> 01:05:38.977
...so you guys come down the other way.

01:05:39.053 --> 01:05:41.613
Now, watch your step.
He's a pretty good-sized ape.

01:05:41.756 --> 01:05:44.953
Call the animal rooms and...
What the hell is he doing down here?

01:06:14.088 --> 01:06:15.850
He must be in here somewhere.

01:06:18.291 --> 01:06:20.054
I'm gonna take a look up here.

01:08:11.369 --> 01:08:13.132
Get out of here!

01:13:59.207 --> 01:14:01.198
What were you doing in the tank room?

01:14:03.145 --> 01:14:06.308
I remember large fragments
of what happened, but not all of it.

01:14:09.418 --> 01:14:11.318
You'll have to be patient with me.

01:14:12.521 --> 01:14:15.684
I've had Mason looking all over Boston
for you all night.

01:14:16.858 --> 01:14:18.348
It's okay. I'm all right.

01:14:27.936 --> 01:14:31.302
I suppose getting a call at 2:30
in the morning from the police...

01:14:32.606 --> 01:14:35.268
...to the effect your husband has been
found sleeping naked...

01:14:35.342 --> 01:14:38.038
...in the city zoo might have caused you
some concern.

01:14:38.245 --> 01:14:39.405
I think you could say that.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.972
And Mason writing you this whole time
that I'm having a nervous breakdown...

01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:45.746
...and you figured
I finally flipped out altogether.

01:14:48.255 --> 01:14:52.316
I'm sorry, Emily. Forgive me. I know
what a harrowing day I've caused you.

01:14:52.393 --> 01:14:54.452
I suppose you've been sitting here
all this time...

01:14:54.528 --> 01:14:57.224
...trying to figure out
how to get me to a psychiatrist.

01:14:57.298 --> 01:14:58.788
As a matter of fact, I have.

01:14:58.966 --> 01:15:01.867
I don't know how you've put up with me
all these years.

01:15:04.338 --> 01:15:05.464
I loved you.

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:13.506
Oh, my God, Emily, I don't know
how to tell you this. I really don't.

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.114
The implications are staggering.

01:15:16.683 --> 01:15:18.913
Apparently I entered
a very primitive consciousness.

01:15:18.985 --> 01:15:21.818
All I can remember is what was
comprehensible to that consciousness.

01:15:21.888 --> 01:15:25.449
I don't remember, at least not clearly,
how I got out of the tank room.

01:15:26.759 --> 01:15:28.818
The first thing I remember are the dogs.

01:15:28.895 --> 01:15:32.126
I followed a pack of wild dogs to the zoo.
That's how I got there.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.736
In the zoo, I hunted down,
killed and ate a small sheep.

01:15:41.574 --> 01:15:44.304
I was utterly primal.
I consisted of nothing more...

01:15:44.377 --> 01:15:47.403
...than the will to survive,
to live through the night...

01:15:47.847 --> 01:15:49.246
...to eat...

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:51.612
...to drink...

01:15:54.486 --> 01:15:55.646
...to sleep.

01:15:59.491 --> 01:16:02.255
It was the most supremely
satisfying time of my life.

01:16:06.231 --> 01:16:07.926
I may have killed a man tonight.

01:16:09.902 --> 01:16:11.164
I remember...

01:16:13.272 --> 01:16:14.830
...beating on a...

01:16:23.649 --> 01:16:26.243
You don't know the trouble I had
getting these clothes.

01:16:26.318 --> 01:16:28.684
I had to go down to the security office.

01:16:30.822 --> 01:16:33.450
They want you to call
the security office right now.

01:16:33.592 --> 01:16:36.424
There was some kind of ape loose
in your isolation tank room tonight.

01:16:36.494 --> 01:16:40.191
Do you know anything about that?
This ape almost killed a security guard.

01:16:40.865 --> 01:16:44.096
You didn't bring some ape
down to that tank room tonight, did you?

01:16:48.673 --> 01:16:51.870
Your watch and stuff are
in your jacket pocket. Are you all right?

01:16:52.944 --> 01:16:54.172
Is he all right?

01:16:54.545 --> 01:16:56.570
Tell Mason what you've been telling me.

01:16:56.714 --> 01:16:58.909
I want to hear Mason's views on all this.

01:17:00.418 --> 01:17:02.682
I think Mason's views will be predictable.

01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:07.521
y God! There it is...

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:13.458
...a proto-human. The first and
the original truly human form.

01:17:14.832 --> 01:17:18.232
Tiny. Perhaps four feet high.
Completely furred.

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:22.365
Chimp-like, but erect.
No knuckle walking. Shorter arms.

01:17:22.439 --> 01:17:27.138
He's moving along so gracefully.
There's two, three of them.

01:17:28.545 --> 01:17:30.172
Bipedal, tiny...

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:40.821
i'm killing...

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:42.858
i'm killing something, a goat.

01:17:43.393 --> 01:17:45.088
i'm killing...

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:48.158
...i'm eating hot flesh.

01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:50.262
i'm eating the blood of a goat.

01:17:54.371 --> 01:17:55.599
Are you okay?

01:17:56.506 --> 01:17:57.495
Beautiful.

01:17:57.607 --> 01:17:58.732
Beautiful.

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:01.404
it sounded like he was having
a bad trip to me.

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:04.037
Some of these tank trips can get
pretty creepy.

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.339
What the hell was that?

01:19:03.404 --> 01:19:05.065
Did I wake you? It's Emily.

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:09.109
Eddie, I'm in a kind of wild panic.
I need to talk to you.

01:19:21.855 --> 01:19:23.846
I don't know how even
to put this into words...

01:19:23.924 --> 01:19:26.222
...but I'm beginning to think
what happened to you was...

01:19:26.293 --> 01:19:28.284
...not just a hallucinatory experience.

01:19:28.361 --> 01:19:32.297
I've got this gut feeling that something
phenomenological did actually happen...

01:19:32.365 --> 01:19:34.993
...that there was some kind
of genetic transformation.

01:19:35.235 --> 01:19:38.602
I don't know why I think this is
in defiance of all rationality, but I do...

01:19:38.672 --> 01:19:42.130
...and now that I do, I'm terrified.
I mean really terrified. Petrified.

01:19:42.209 --> 01:19:43.301
So am I.

01:19:43.376 --> 01:19:45.537
I don't want you doing
this experiment again next week.

01:19:45.612 --> 01:19:47.079
I have to find out if it actually happened.

01:19:47.147 --> 01:19:48.774
I'm asking you to put the experiment off...

01:19:48.849 --> 01:19:50.817
...till we understand it more
to minimize the risk.

01:19:50.884 --> 01:19:53.580
You can't. You have to work back
from the event itself.

01:19:53.653 --> 01:19:56.281
But you may be causing yourself
irreversible genetic damage!

01:19:56.356 --> 01:19:57.550
We're not dealing with genetics!

01:19:57.624 --> 01:19:59.819
We're beyond mass and matter here,
beyond even energy.

01:19:59.893 --> 01:20:01.951
What we're back to is the first thought.

01:20:03.362 --> 01:20:05.159
I'm trying to tell you I love you.

01:20:06.332 --> 01:20:07.560
I know that.

01:20:08.868 --> 01:20:12.565
And I'm trying to tell you,
this is an all-bets-are-off sort of thing.

01:20:12.705 --> 01:20:16.197
We may be opening a black box that may
scrap our whole picture of space-time.

01:20:16.275 --> 01:20:18.436
We might even have a link
to another universe.

01:20:18.511 --> 01:20:21.776
For God's sake, you're a scientist.
You must know how I feel.

01:20:24.483 --> 01:20:26.383
Yes, I know how you feel.

01:20:29.488 --> 01:20:32.150
It's very late.
Would you like to stay here tonight?

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:37.991
I could do with a little love
and a little reassurance right now.

01:20:39.298 --> 01:20:40.697
You'll stay, won't you?

01:21:19.103 --> 01:21:22.402
If I come out of that tank anthropoid,
I'll be in a very primitive state...

01:21:22.473 --> 01:21:26.238
...and impossible to relate to,
so sedate me while I'm still in the tank...

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.336
...otherwise you'll have to chase me around
and subdue me.

01:21:30.948 --> 01:21:33.644
You come out of that tank
looking like an ape...

01:21:33.717 --> 01:21:36.481
...I'm going over to Mass. Mental
and commit myself.

01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:40.089
If it happens, we'll bring him down
with a big bolus of Amytal.

01:21:40.157 --> 01:21:43.490
What do you mean if it happens?
Everybody keeps saying if it happens!

01:21:43.694 --> 01:21:47.721
Do you think something is gonna happen?
Because if you do, I'd like to know.

01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:51.358
I'm sorry. I'm just nervous as hell.

01:21:51.768 --> 01:21:52.894
Listen, so am I.

01:22:56.865 --> 01:22:57.991
Anything happen?

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.659
I just checked him 10 minutes ago.

01:23:01.803 --> 01:23:03.532
Did you order chicken or turkey?

01:23:03.605 --> 01:23:05.300
I hope chicken is all right.

01:23:05.373 --> 01:23:07.705
I've got nearly 11:00.
That's more than two hours now.

01:23:07.776 --> 01:23:09.539
I think we should stop this.

01:23:10.378 --> 01:23:11.936
Frankly, I'm really frightened!

01:23:12.013 --> 01:23:14.038
We could be screwing up
his whole genetic structure!

01:23:14.115 --> 01:23:15.776
Now how do we stop this?

01:23:15.884 --> 01:23:18.045
- Can you bring him down?
- He's gonna be sore as hell.

01:23:18.119 --> 01:23:19.484
We should never have let him do it!

01:23:19.554 --> 01:23:21.852
I don't know how we let him
talk us into this.

01:23:21.923 --> 01:23:23.982
We were humoring him,
but we know he's not crazy...

01:23:24.059 --> 01:23:25.549
...and we all know, deep in our hearts...

01:23:25.627 --> 01:23:28.561
...he may be onto something
beyond our own comprehension!

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:31.496
Now, because I believe him,
I want this thing stopped!

01:31:19.088 --> 01:31:20.487
His signs are all good.

01:31:20.556 --> 01:31:22.524
He'll sleep a day or two,
come out a bit stuporous.

01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:24.582
He's got a whopping load of drugs in him.

01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:27.356
It's not uncommon
for a psychedelic experience like this...

01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:28.454
...to whack you out.

01:31:28.531 --> 01:31:30.863
You'd hardly call this
just a psychedelic experience.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.195
His heart is good. His pressure is good.

01:31:33.269 --> 01:31:35.533
I'm more worried about you
than I am about him.

01:31:35.604 --> 01:31:36.662
I'm all right.

01:31:44.879 --> 01:31:47.905
Of all the goddamn men in this whole
world, why do I have to love this one?

01:31:47.982 --> 01:31:49.449
I can't get him out of me.

01:31:50.151 --> 01:31:52.949
Do you know how many men
I tried to fall in love with this past year?

01:31:53.021 --> 01:31:56.286
No matter who I'm in bed with, I have
to imagine it's him or nothing happens.

01:31:56.357 --> 01:31:58.348
No matter who I'm eating with
or walking with...

01:31:58.426 --> 01:32:00.951
...there's always this pain
because it isn't him.

01:32:01.663 --> 01:32:03.358
I'm possessed by him.

01:32:07.168 --> 01:32:08.635
Oh, it's crazy!

01:32:10.305 --> 01:32:12.364
I think that's the way it's supposed to be.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.668
But he doesn't give a damn about me!

01:32:13.741 --> 01:32:16.676
You're the only thing he cares about
outside of his work.

01:32:18.613 --> 01:32:22.014
I was never real to him. Nothing in
the human condition was ever real to him.

01:32:22.083 --> 01:32:23.345
He's a truth lover.

01:32:23.885 --> 01:32:27.752
Reality to Eddie is only that
which is changeless, immutably constant.

01:32:28.789 --> 01:32:31.781
What happened to Eddie tonight,
that was Eddie's idea of love.

01:32:33.794 --> 01:32:35.455
That's consummation.

01:32:36.630 --> 01:32:39.121
He finally got it off with God.

01:32:39.199 --> 01:32:43.568
He finally embraced the Absolute,
was finally ravished by Truth...

01:32:43.637 --> 01:32:45.730
...and it goddamned near destroyed him!

01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:50.271
He never loved me.
You knew him as well as I did.

01:32:50.344 --> 01:32:53.404
We were all bits
of transitory matter to him.

01:32:56.049 --> 01:32:59.541
All right, now, you're going into shock.
I'm going to get you something.

01:33:14.233 --> 01:33:17.498
We reached a point tonight
where physical science just breaks down.

01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:19.060
We're in blue skies!

01:33:19.372 --> 01:33:21.966
Tonight was history,
and what are we going to do about it?

01:33:22.375 --> 01:33:24.343
I'm going to do nothing about it!

01:33:24.644 --> 01:33:26.202
Tonight scared the hell out of me!

01:33:26.279 --> 01:33:27.906
That tank just blew up!

01:33:28.247 --> 01:33:31.774
Whatever happened inside that tank
released a hell of a lot of energy.

01:33:32.618 --> 01:33:36.418
For God's sake, let's drop this goddamn
thing. I don't want to talk about it.

01:33:36.489 --> 01:33:39.390
I can't help it!
You may want to go to sleep...

01:33:39.492 --> 01:33:42.290
...but the way I feel
I don't expect to go to sleep for a year!

01:33:42.361 --> 01:33:44.329
I'm on fucking fire!

01:33:44.931 --> 01:33:48.889
I am in there mopping up the goddamned
tank room and I would like to know why!

01:33:49.367 --> 01:33:51.392
Do you believe in supernatural agencies?

01:33:51.469 --> 01:33:52.800
No, sir, I do not!

01:33:53.471 --> 01:33:56.668
Then what we saw tonight was
a physical phenomenon...

01:33:56.741 --> 01:33:59.471
...an inexplicable physical phenomenon!

01:33:59.544 --> 01:34:02.308
If it's phenomenological,
then it's explicable. I have to know why.

01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.244
Let me talk!

01:34:03.315 --> 01:34:04.748
I've been mopping that tank room...

01:34:04.816 --> 01:34:07.444
...for the last three hours
and I've had it! Leave me alone!

01:34:07.519 --> 01:34:10.716
I would like to tell you
what I would like to do!

01:34:10.922 --> 01:34:13.413
We have got to repeat this
with other human subjects!

01:34:13.491 --> 01:34:14.958
We need a selective sample!

01:34:15.026 --> 01:34:18.052
We will put up a notice
in the Student Union for volunteers!

01:34:18.263 --> 01:34:21.232
And get five or six subjects
and go back to square one with them...

01:34:21.299 --> 01:34:22.926
...and step up the doses of the drug...

01:34:23.001 --> 01:34:26.198
...in a graduated fashion
and check them against Eddie's values!

01:34:26.805 --> 01:34:29.898
We could even get a grant,
for Christ's sake!

01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:36.644
And here you are, willing to use an
untested drug on innocent human beings!

01:34:37.014 --> 01:34:38.311
Please stop shouting!

01:34:47.758 --> 01:34:48.816
How are you?

01:34:50.294 --> 01:34:52.228
Would you like to go back to sleep?

01:34:54.231 --> 01:34:55.357
Yes.

01:34:56.667 --> 01:34:59.602
Would you mind if Mason had
a quick look at you first?

01:35:01.438 --> 01:35:02.632
Good idea.

01:35:06.143 --> 01:35:08.441
Maybe you ought to have
a quick look at him.

01:36:11.707 --> 01:36:13.299
Oh, I hope it isn't the kids.

01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:15.968
Hello?

01:36:19.815 --> 01:36:21.942
Everything's fine, Arthur. He's fine.

01:36:22.784 --> 01:36:24.513
It's Arthur. Are you fine?

01:36:26.588 --> 01:36:29.614
I'll call you back when I'm more awake.
Everything is fine.

01:36:34.862 --> 01:36:36.591
God, I wonder what time it is.

01:36:38.332 --> 01:36:39.765
I should call the kids.

01:36:41.502 --> 01:36:43.800
I can't tell you
how much you mean to me...

01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:47.763
...how much I need you and the kids.
I just wanted you to know that.

01:36:48.042 --> 01:36:51.273
You saved me. You redeemed me
from the pit. I was in it, Emily.

01:36:51.979 --> 01:36:54.675
I was in that ultimate moment of terror...

01:36:54.749 --> 01:36:56.717
...that is the beginning of life.

01:36:56.951 --> 01:36:58.145
It is nothing.

01:36:59.553 --> 01:37:01.521
Simple, hideous nothing.

01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:06.748
The final truth of all things is
that there is no final Truth.

01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:12.258
Truth is what's transitory.
It's human life that is real.

01:37:12.333 --> 01:37:13.459
I don't want to frighten you...

01:37:13.534 --> 01:37:16.366
...but what I'm trying to tell you is
that moment of terror...

01:37:16.436 --> 01:37:19.837
...is a real and living horror,
living and growing within me now...

01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:24.000
...and the only thing that keeps it
from devouring me is you.

01:37:24.244 --> 01:37:26.212
Why don't you just come back to us?

01:37:28.948 --> 01:37:32.475
It's too late.
I don't think I can get out of it anymore.

01:37:33.553 --> 01:37:36.044
I can't live with it. The pain is too great.

01:37:44.664 --> 01:37:45.824
Defy it, Eddie!

01:37:45.899 --> 01:37:48.333
You made it real. You can make it unreal!

01:37:48.802 --> 01:37:50.235
If you love me, Eddie...

01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:51.459
...if you love me!

01:37:51.538 --> 01:37:53.267
Eddie! Defy it!

01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:41.172
I love you, Emily.
