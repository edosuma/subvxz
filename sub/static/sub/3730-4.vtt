00:00.900 --> 00:01.500
<i>Previously on "The Whispers"...</i>

00:02.100 --> 00:05.135
My friend Drill.
He speaks through the lights.

00:05.219 --> 00:07.754
But each of these kids claims
to have a friend named Drill

00:07.839 --> 00:09.105
that no one else can see.

00:09.207 --> 00:11.341
- You know who he is.
- I think it might be my husband.

00:11.425 --> 00:14.227
He's experiencing some kind of memory loss.

00:14.345 --> 00:16.263
Each of your tattoos,
they represent a place?

00:16.347 --> 00:17.731
Sometimes a person.

00:17.848 --> 00:19.683
You kidnapped me for a reason!

00:19.767 --> 00:20.934
You must know!

00:21.018 --> 00:22.619
I never know... not until I get there.

00:22.720 --> 00:23.820
That's how this works.

00:23.905 --> 00:25.088
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

00:25.189 --> 00:26.289
It's a message.

00:26.390 --> 00:27.791
What's it saying?

00:27.892 --> 00:30.193
My son... two years ago, he got sick.

00:30.278 --> 00:31.528
He lost his hearing.

00:31.662 --> 00:33.780
You knew how shaky things
were at home for her.

00:33.864 --> 00:34.948
You think I took advantage of Claire.

00:35.032 --> 00:36.800
You have no idea what she and I had.

00:36.901 --> 00:40.103
If Sean survived and he is here,
I have to find him.

00:40.204 --> 00:41.538
I need to know about Drill.

00:41.622 --> 00:43.540
He asked you to play a game, didn't he?

00:43.624 --> 00:45.575
He wanted me to go on daddy's computer

00:45.676 --> 00:46.926
and look for the treasure.

00:47.044 --> 00:48.011
And what was the treasure?

00:48.045 --> 00:50.380
It's the Harbor Point nuclear power plant.

00:50.481 --> 00:52.265
That's where Sean's going.

00:52.383 --> 00:55.452
Drill... Find my daddy and bring him home.

00:55.553 --> 00:57.353
I'll do anything.

01:04.979 --> 01:06.229
What's next, Drill?

01:08.315 --> 01:10.149
Is that one word or two?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.882 --> 01:25.965
Now what?

01:32.923 --> 01:33.973
Are you sure?

01:35.426 --> 01:36.476
Okay.

02:02.786 --> 02:04.370
Oh.

02:04.454 --> 02:05.788
Good morning.

02:05.872 --> 02:07.290
Mm!

02:10.372 --> 02:11.573
_

02:11.712 --> 02:15.131
Something important for work.

02:15.265 --> 02:18.801
Anything I can help you with?

02:18.865 --> 02:20.665
_

02:45.662 --> 02:46.996
Hi, Henry.

02:47.047 --> 02:48.330
I'm Minx.

02:49.416 --> 02:51.600
Drill said I should come over to play.

02:52.919 --> 02:54.970
He also told me you can hear now.

02:56.423 --> 02:59.842
Don't worry. I can keep a secret.

03:03.063 --> 03:04.730
Your mommy's pretty.

03:04.848 --> 03:06.565
Not as pretty as mine, but...

03:06.683 --> 03:10.352
Does she... Know you're here?

03:10.437 --> 03:11.353
My mom?

03:11.438 --> 03:12.688
Lately, she's more interested

03:12.822 --> 03:14.857
in where my dad is than where I am.

03:14.941 --> 03:15.941
I'm sorry.

03:16.026 --> 03:17.026
It's okay.

03:17.110 --> 03:18.861
Drill says it's gonna get better soon.

03:18.962 --> 03:20.229
He's helping.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.697
He wants to help you, too.

03:21.798 --> 03:23.032
With what?

03:23.116 --> 03:24.783
Someone you're looking for.

03:26.369 --> 03:28.871
Drill says he can help you
get what you want

03:29.005 --> 03:31.040
if you help him get what he wants.

03:31.205 --> 03:32.905
What do I have to do?

03:34.305 --> 03:35.490
Just...

03:35.505 --> 03:36.806
Play a game.

04:29.195 --> 04:31.596
I didn't realize the D.O.D.
and the FBI had a carpool program.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.181
You must be Agent Rollins.

04:33.265 --> 04:35.183
Mr. Lawrence.

04:35.267 --> 04:37.101
Paul Wheeler, representing
torrent energy group

04:37.186 --> 04:38.486
who own and operate Harbor Point.

04:38.604 --> 04:39.937
This is Reid, our chief of security.

04:40.022 --> 04:41.489
He's put the plant on lockdown,
as requested,

04:41.607 --> 04:42.990
but I imagine he's just as eager as I am

04:43.108 --> 04:44.775
to know exactly
what the hell is going on here.

04:44.860 --> 04:47.812
We have intel that
a United States air force pilot

04:47.913 --> 04:49.780
has been receiving funds
from inside a rogue state.

04:49.915 --> 04:50.998
Mostly likely Libya.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.251
And during that time,
he's gone to extreme measures

04:53.335 --> 04:55.870
to ensure reports of a damaged cooling pipe

04:55.954 --> 04:57.588
inside this plant
did not get into the hands

04:57.673 --> 04:59.090
of anyone who might be able to fix it.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.292
It's our opinion that he plans
on exploiting that flaw

05:01.426 --> 05:03.177
to create some kind of contamination event.

05:03.295 --> 05:04.795
Where did you say you found this, again?

05:04.930 --> 05:06.047
Here.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.015
Coming in here with a lot
of information, Claire.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.684
Maybe if you'd just been straight
with me... I showed everything I had.

05:10.802 --> 05:13.521
With Wes Lawrence, but not your partner.

05:13.638 --> 05:16.440
Though, I guess that wouldn't be
the first time, would it?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.476
You know, if it wasn't for
Wes and I working together,

05:18.560 --> 05:20.861
you'd still be on the floor
of a gas-station bathroom

05:20.979 --> 05:22.863
looking for hair samples.

05:22.981 --> 05:25.366
So a simple thank-you will suffice.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.069
Rollins.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.492
Found a car wreck about 3 miles from here.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.910
Matches the description of the vehicle

05:35.994 --> 05:37.578
stolen from the area
Bennigan was last spotted.

05:37.662 --> 05:39.163
Okay, coordinate with security.

05:39.247 --> 05:41.332
We need spotters on the entry roads.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.669
Claire, you sure you're okay?

05:45.804 --> 05:47.671
It's fine.

05:47.756 --> 05:50.674
Give me full comms with your people inside.

05:50.759 --> 05:52.760
We need to know everything they do.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.446
Security 1.

05:56.514 --> 05:57.681
Yes, sir.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.067
We're gonna need a broadcast.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.902
- Which camera?
- All of them.

06:05.023 --> 06:06.740
Sorry I'm late.

06:06.858 --> 06:09.410
Saw some action at the perimeter.

06:09.527 --> 06:11.195
You heard about anything going on?

06:11.329 --> 06:12.279
Nothing.

06:14.866 --> 06:16.366
She's still running a little hot.

06:16.451 --> 06:17.868
Water's tripped level 4.

06:17.952 --> 06:19.336
You called it in last night, right?

06:19.437 --> 06:21.588
I'm sure they've got a team
in there looking at things,

06:21.706 --> 06:24.508
and if there's a problem,
I'm sure they'll find it.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.544
Why does Drill want me
to find these things?

06:27.629 --> 06:30.430
It's like a treasure hunt.

06:33.551 --> 06:35.853
"The first thing you have to do

06:35.937 --> 06:38.555
is take your bike to black-eyed Sue."

06:38.690 --> 06:42.776
I don't think
my grandma will let me do that.

06:43.895 --> 06:46.480
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.201
Oh.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.904
I'm sorry. I didn't...

06:55.373 --> 06:56.840
Who's your friend, Henry?

06:56.941 --> 06:58.325
I'm Minx.

06:58.409 --> 07:00.711
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Ah.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.997
I didn't know Henry was
having any friends over today.

07:05.995 --> 07:09.395
_

07:11.889 --> 07:14.257
Well... Okay.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.359
Have fun.

07:16.461 --> 07:18.812
Just, um...

07:18.930 --> 07:23.166
Let me know if you need anything.

07:29.523 --> 07:32.275
I don't think this is a good idea.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.327
I don't want to get in trouble.

07:34.445 --> 07:36.613
Don't you want to know where your dad is?

07:36.747 --> 07:40.050
Why didn't Drill ask me to do this himself?

07:40.151 --> 07:42.752
I don't know. Maybe he's busy.

07:50.294 --> 07:51.928
Okay.

07:53.464 --> 07:55.048
I'll play.

07:55.132 --> 07:57.267
Good. Drill will be really happy.

07:59.470 --> 08:01.638
You're not coming?

08:01.722 --> 08:02.972
It's not my game.

08:03.057 --> 08:05.809
Besides, someone has to stay here.

08:05.943 --> 08:06.893
Why?

08:09.013 --> 08:12.065
To make sure nobody tells on you.

08:12.149 --> 08:14.317
Okay, let's talk about
a worst-case scenario.

08:14.401 --> 08:15.819
In the event of a-a full meltdown...

08:15.953 --> 08:17.070
whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

08:17.154 --> 08:18.738
There's not gonna be any meltdown, okay?

08:18.823 --> 08:21.040
W-we have a number
of contingencies in place.

08:21.158 --> 08:23.459
If the water around the core
drops to a dangerous level

08:23.544 --> 08:26.879
due to the leak you discovered,
we shift over to the E.C.C.S.

08:26.997 --> 08:28.765
The emergency core cooling system.

08:28.866 --> 08:30.700
Which runs on a completely
different set of pipes.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.168
Why don't we just shut down
the plant entirely?

08:32.269 --> 08:33.970
That way, there's no chance
that... powering down a reactor

08:34.054 --> 08:37.707
is a complicated and expensive process.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.927
So is treating an entire county
for radiation poisoning.

08:41.010 --> 08:42.260
Maybe I'm missing something,

08:42.395 --> 08:44.179
but we've identified
the flaw in the reactor.

08:44.314 --> 08:46.065
If bennigan was trying to cause a meltdown,

08:46.183 --> 08:47.183
we've already stopped him.

08:47.317 --> 08:49.152
And yet he's still heading this way.

08:49.236 --> 08:51.437
If all he wanted was
for this place to overheat,

08:51.522 --> 08:53.356
he wouldn't have to be here, so...

08:53.490 --> 08:55.191
Maybe he knows we're onto him.

08:55.275 --> 08:56.526
No, he kidnapped the doctor

08:56.610 --> 08:58.528
long before we figured out
where he was going.

08:58.662 --> 09:01.364
He was always coming here.

09:01.465 --> 09:02.698
Why?

09:02.783 --> 09:05.001
Let him come. He's not gonna get in.

09:05.085 --> 09:06.702
And the minute he does,
my men will be all over him.

09:06.787 --> 09:08.371
What's that?

09:08.455 --> 09:10.123
The evacuation signal.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.043
We're on it.

09:14.127 --> 09:15.711
- Well, shut it down.
- We're trying.

09:15.796 --> 09:17.213
Nothing we're doing seems to be working.

09:17.347 --> 09:18.881
There's some kind
of electrical malfunction.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.933
What's the protocol
when this alarm's triggered?

09:21.051 --> 09:22.602
All nonessential personnel

09:22.719 --> 09:24.887
have to vacate the premises immediately.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.783
How many exits do they have?

09:37.901 --> 09:39.568
Four.

09:39.653 --> 09:41.454
Son of a bitch.

09:43.206 --> 09:44.407
Sean.

09:44.541 --> 09:47.243
Please... please just let me go.

09:47.377 --> 09:48.744
- I can't.
- Why?!

09:48.879 --> 09:50.079
Because, just like me,

09:50.213 --> 09:52.665
there's a reason why you're here, Maria.

09:52.749 --> 09:55.418
Don't you want to find out what that is?

10:01.325 --> 10:03.993
Minx?

10:04.111 --> 10:05.995
I made some snacks for you and Henry.

10:06.113 --> 10:07.280
Where are you?

10:07.364 --> 10:09.031
Upstairs?

10:23.630 --> 10:26.432
Kids?

10:26.516 --> 10:28.551
Hello?

10:34.841 --> 10:36.559
Hmm.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.645
Oh, my goodness, you gave me a fright!

10:39.730 --> 10:42.314
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

10:42.399 --> 10:45.618
Didn't you hear me calling?

10:45.652 --> 10:46.819
No, I didn't.

10:48.905 --> 10:50.206
I cut myself.

10:50.323 --> 10:52.541
Can you help me find a band-aid?

10:52.659 --> 10:54.043
Ohhh.

10:54.161 --> 10:55.995
Of course I can.

10:56.997 --> 10:58.547
How on earth did you do that?

10:58.665 --> 11:01.333
It was a thorn from the rosebush outside.

11:01.418 --> 11:03.502
Well, you need to be more careful.

11:03.587 --> 11:05.671
Is Henry out there with you?

11:05.805 --> 11:07.806
Yeah. I think he's riding his bike.

11:29.729 --> 11:32.030
"One step closer to your answer."

11:32.132 --> 11:34.500
"Look out for the yellow dancer."

11:38.672 --> 11:39.922
No sign of Sean.

11:41.407 --> 11:42.291
You?

11:42.375 --> 11:43.709
Nothing.

11:43.793 --> 11:45.711
I have a sweep-and-secure team
ready to move.

11:45.795 --> 11:47.596
He's inside, they'll find him
and wrap him up.

11:47.714 --> 11:49.214
Agent rollins, your men aren't trained

11:49.349 --> 11:50.799
to operate in this kind of facility.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.384
For the safety of everyone involved,

11:52.435 --> 11:54.303
we can't allow your agents
to conduct maneuvers

11:54.387 --> 11:55.721
in an area they don't understand.

11:55.855 --> 11:57.389
Harbor point has its own security team

11:57.474 --> 11:59.892
trained specifically to deal
with these types of situations.

12:00.026 --> 12:02.194
If anything requires action,
they can handle it.

12:02.278 --> 12:03.612
Excuse me. Mr. Lawrence?

12:05.231 --> 12:06.114
We just lost a camera.

12:06.232 --> 12:07.449
Where?

12:07.567 --> 12:09.451
I'll be damned!
That's the guy! That's the guy!

12:09.569 --> 12:11.570
This is gate 2-7. We've got eyes...

12:11.654 --> 12:13.071
- What's wrong?
- The phone just went dead.

12:13.156 --> 12:14.289
What do you mean it went dead?!

12:14.407 --> 12:15.991
- What the hell?!
- What?

12:16.075 --> 12:18.744
The door's malfunctioning, too.
We're locked in.

12:25.251 --> 12:26.501
This is Wheeler.

12:26.586 --> 12:28.637
Sorry, sir, I'm calling about
the spike in core temperature

12:28.755 --> 12:30.055
I reported yesterday.

12:30.089 --> 12:32.257
Yesterday? How is this
the first I'm hearing about it?

12:32.392 --> 12:33.391
I don't know, sir.

12:33.476 --> 12:34.926
As soon as the water level started to drop,

12:35.061 --> 12:36.144
we sent it up the chain.

12:36.262 --> 12:37.813
Word came back that someone at the NRC

12:37.930 --> 12:39.514
texted them that it was being handled.

12:39.599 --> 12:41.566
This is Wes Lawrence, D.O.D.

12:41.651 --> 12:43.151
We're gonna need you to switch over

12:43.269 --> 12:44.486
to the E.C.C.S. Immediately,

12:44.604 --> 12:46.271
see if that takes care of the situation.

12:46.405 --> 12:48.023
Send some of your men over to Gate 27.

12:48.107 --> 12:50.692
- Any reason to believe it's Bennigan?
- Any reason not to?

12:53.112 --> 12:54.613
This is Reid.

12:54.697 --> 12:58.250
I need a secure team at Gate 27... now!

13:06.092 --> 13:07.459
Hi, mom.

13:07.543 --> 13:08.860
Everything okay with Henry?

13:08.961 --> 13:10.128
He's fine.

13:10.212 --> 13:11.463
I was actually just calling

13:11.597 --> 13:13.598
to get a phone number
for his friend's parents.

13:13.683 --> 13:15.967
She cut her finger a little,
and I just wanted to...

13:16.102 --> 13:16.968
friend?

13:17.103 --> 13:19.854
Mom, which friend?

13:19.972 --> 13:22.190
Henry's playdate, Minx.

13:22.308 --> 13:24.692
She's very sweet. They've been
playing together all morning.

13:24.810 --> 13:26.811
Okay, mom, I... I need you to find Henry

13:26.896 --> 13:29.147
and ask him some questions for me, okay?

13:29.231 --> 13:30.448
Okay.

13:30.533 --> 13:33.568
Minx, can you bring Henry
to the phone for me, please?

13:33.652 --> 13:36.070
Sorry. I have to go now.

13:36.155 --> 13:37.872
Well, wait a minute, where...

13:37.990 --> 13:39.707
- Where...
- Mom?

13:39.825 --> 13:42.327
Mom, find him.

13:42.411 --> 13:44.412
Claire, I don't see him. He's not here.

13:44.497 --> 13:47.415
Jessup, I need you
to put out an Amber alert on my son.

13:47.499 --> 13:48.967
I'll get you a picture. What's going on?

13:49.051 --> 13:50.168
Your daughter... Minx.

13:50.252 --> 13:51.719
she was at my house
with Henry, and now he's gone.

13:51.837 --> 13:52.921
O-okay, slow down. I don't understand.

13:53.005 --> 13:54.639
Wes, Wes, what if all this,
everything here,

13:54.723 --> 13:56.224
was just a-a-a wild goose chase...

13:56.342 --> 13:57.342
something to distract us

13:57.426 --> 13:59.060
while Sean got what he really wanted?

13:59.178 --> 14:00.645
W-which is what?

14:00.729 --> 14:01.763
His son.

14:28.540 --> 14:29.540
Drill?

14:29.625 --> 14:33.211
Is that you, Drill?

14:44.022 --> 14:46.224
"The treasure that you're here to seek

14:46.308 --> 14:48.943
is further down along the creek."

15:28.967 --> 15:30.851
- I'm going to find him.
- Okay.

15:30.936 --> 15:32.403
Hey, I am no good to anyone here

15:32.487 --> 15:33.971
until I know that my son is safe.

15:34.072 --> 15:35.239
Okay, okay, I'll talk to Lena,

15:35.323 --> 15:37.107
- find out what she knows from Minx.
- Okay.

15:37.242 --> 15:38.325
- Claire?
- Yeah.

15:39.444 --> 15:41.528
- I know. I know.
- Okay. Okay.

15:47.702 --> 15:49.286
Mr. Lawrence.

15:49.371 --> 15:50.537
We have eyes on him.

15:55.427 --> 15:57.928
How the hell has he gotten
this far without being spotted?

15:58.029 --> 16:00.097
I don't know, but he's
not getting any further.

16:00.181 --> 16:02.099
The access doors to the facility
lock electronically.

16:02.183 --> 16:04.017
Without a key card,
there's no way he's getting...

16:04.102 --> 16:05.969
he's working with someone inside.

16:07.389 --> 16:08.472
Who's helping you?

16:08.556 --> 16:10.140
You don't seem like
the type to follow orders

16:10.275 --> 16:11.975
without knowing who's giving them.

16:17.816 --> 16:19.199
You're right about that.

16:20.785 --> 16:22.619
If you were gonna kill me,

16:22.704 --> 16:25.322
why didn't you just shoot me back there?

16:25.457 --> 16:27.491
Just... just take it.

16:27.659 --> 16:28.659
Please.

16:30.128 --> 16:31.328
Look, I'm supposed to be here.

16:31.462 --> 16:34.548
I-I just don't know why,
or maybe I just can't remember,

16:34.666 --> 16:37.000
but either way, you've been
wondering why I brought you here.

16:37.135 --> 16:38.335
This is why.

16:38.419 --> 16:42.723
If I do something bad,
I want you to shoot me.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.509
You're a good person, Maria,

16:45.593 --> 16:48.145
but in case I'm not...

16:55.019 --> 16:57.104
I don't know what makes you crazier...

16:57.188 --> 16:59.773
hearing voices in the light

16:59.857 --> 17:01.858
or giving a Colombian her gun back.

17:03.828 --> 17:05.494
What are you doing? Stop that!

17:05.579 --> 17:07.364
- Agh!
- Stop that!

17:09.200 --> 17:10.534
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Wait!

17:10.667 --> 17:12.252
I was a hostage!

17:18.459 --> 17:20.042
That's great.

17:20.127 --> 17:21.294
They got him.

17:25.016 --> 17:26.383
I'll call Claire?

17:26.517 --> 17:28.018
No.

17:28.102 --> 17:29.886
No, she should hear it from me.

17:33.391 --> 17:35.308
Wes?

17:35.393 --> 17:36.476
Claire, we got him.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.978
Sean... he's... he's in custody.

17:39.397 --> 17:40.447
Claire?

17:42.867 --> 17:44.768
You okay?

17:44.869 --> 17:46.236
Claire?

17:51.242 --> 17:52.375
Claire, what's happening?

17:56.831 --> 17:58.248
It's Henry.

18:00.384 --> 18:02.051
I know where he's going.

18:11.485 --> 18:12.518
Today saw a lot of activity

18:12.603 --> 18:13.603
at the Harbor Point nuclear facility

18:14.585 --> 18:15.835
near the Chesapeake Bay.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.271
As you can see,
both FBI and homeland security

18:18.372 --> 18:19.839
have been called to the scene.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.425
Not a lot of information
available right now,

18:22.510 --> 18:24.144
just reports of an evacuation order...

18:26.847 --> 18:28.815
Wes. Are you okay?

18:29.346 --> 18:30.430
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:30.514 --> 18:32.432
It's over, actually.

18:32.516 --> 18:35.185
Oh. Good. I was starting to get...

18:35.269 --> 18:36.352
Is Minx there?

18:36.487 --> 18:38.188
Of course. Why?

18:38.272 --> 18:40.440
Because, according to Claire Bennigan,

18:40.524 --> 18:43.776
she's been over at her house
all day, playing with her son.

18:45.446 --> 18:48.197
Uh, Wes, this is, um...

18:50.834 --> 18:53.119
She's been in the garage all morning.

18:54.705 --> 18:55.588
Doing what?

18:55.706 --> 18:57.373
Working on an art project.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.042
Well, what... what kind of, uh...

18:59.126 --> 19:01.210
I don't know, Wes. Do you want
me to go interrogate her?

19:01.345 --> 19:03.963
It's a rainbow-loom cellphone case.

19:04.048 --> 19:06.382
Since daddy's always
on the phone, he'll see it...

19:06.517 --> 19:08.051
and always think of me.

19:10.804 --> 19:13.723
It was supposed to be a surprise.

19:13.857 --> 19:15.775
You getting this?

19:15.893 --> 19:17.226
Yeah.

19:17.361 --> 19:18.728
I'm sorry. Look, do me a favor.

19:18.862 --> 19:20.730
Don't let her out of your sight
until I get home.

19:20.864 --> 19:22.565
Wes...

19:22.649 --> 19:24.100
Lena, we'll talk about this
when I get home.

19:24.201 --> 19:26.269
Please, honey, just trust me.

19:26.370 --> 19:28.704
I have to go.

19:33.210 --> 19:34.410
Don't worry.

19:34.494 --> 19:35.995
Daddy's fine.

19:36.079 --> 19:38.497
Whatever was happening there, it's...

19:38.582 --> 19:40.082
He said it's under control.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.684
Is that the truth?

19:41.785 --> 19:43.252
Of course.

19:43.353 --> 19:44.587
What...

19:44.688 --> 19:46.138
Why would you ask me that?

19:46.256 --> 19:48.641
It's just...

19:48.759 --> 19:52.094
I don't think grown-ups always
really know what's going on,

19:52.229 --> 19:53.979
even when they say they do.

19:57.184 --> 19:59.068
I don't know what's going on!

19:59.102 --> 20:00.820
- I was the hostage! I was the hostage!
- Ma'am, calm down.

20:00.937 --> 20:02.822
You have to let me go!
There's a reason why I'm here!

20:02.939 --> 20:05.524
Call Claire Bennigan at the FBI... please.

20:05.609 --> 20:06.859
She'll explain everything.

20:06.943 --> 20:08.110
Don't talk to the FBI!

20:08.195 --> 20:10.613
They don't know who I am
any more than I do!

20:10.747 --> 20:12.865
What the hell is that?

20:12.949 --> 20:14.500
Sounds like it's coming from the pipes.

20:14.618 --> 20:16.218
The E.C.C.S... It just shut down.

20:16.319 --> 20:17.653
What do you mean "shut down"?

20:17.754 --> 20:20.289
The only ones with the power to
shut it down are in this room.

20:20.423 --> 20:23.008
Are you sure about that?

20:23.126 --> 20:25.010
- Where you headed?
- To talk to my suspect.

20:25.128 --> 20:26.629
- I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
- Like hell you can't.

20:26.713 --> 20:29.215
We just got word the emergency
cooling system failed.

20:29.299 --> 20:31.183
We can't let you inside
the facility, Mr. Lawrence...

20:31.268 --> 20:32.885
Not until we assess the level of danger
we're dealing with! It didn't just fail!

20:32.969 --> 20:34.386
Do you think that's a coincidence?

20:35.772 --> 20:37.306
Look, no one man can do what he did.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.308
- H-he has help.
- From who?

20:39.442 --> 20:41.226
You find me a way to talk to him,

20:41.311 --> 20:42.978
and I promise I will find out.

20:43.063 --> 20:44.613
Keep him here.

21:02.332 --> 21:05.801
"If you want to win the game,
there's somewhere you must go...

21:05.885 --> 21:09.555
down the metal rabbit hole
into the dark below."

22:02.725 --> 22:03.692
Enough!

22:28.918 --> 22:30.819
Sean Bennigan?

22:30.920 --> 22:33.488
This is Wes Lawrence
with the department of defense.

22:38.828 --> 22:40.295
Sean.

22:41.897 --> 22:43.098
Is that my name?

22:43.182 --> 22:45.350
Yes, it is.

22:47.036 --> 22:49.771
Sean, I need to ask you
a couple of questions.

22:53.442 --> 22:55.326
I'm not so good with answers.

22:55.444 --> 22:56.945
Right, the... the memory thing.

22:57.079 --> 22:58.780
I heard about that.

22:58.914 --> 23:00.999
Okay, how about this?

23:01.117 --> 23:03.118
I won't ask you about anything
that happened in the past.

23:03.202 --> 23:06.337
All I care about
is who was helping you today.

23:11.427 --> 23:12.377
I don't know.

23:12.461 --> 23:14.679
You're going to jail, Sean.

23:14.797 --> 23:16.764
How helpful you are to me
in the next two minutes

23:16.866 --> 23:18.967
will decide whether or not
you'll ever get out of there.

23:19.051 --> 23:21.469
You don't understand.
Something is gonna happen here!

23:21.554 --> 23:23.638
We know about the flaw in the cooling pipe.

23:23.689 --> 23:25.807
Whatever you had planned...
it's not my plan!

23:25.941 --> 23:27.775
It's not my plan!!

23:27.860 --> 23:28.810
Calm down, Sean.

23:28.944 --> 23:30.311
I'm trying to help you here.

23:30.412 --> 23:32.113
You don't understand!

23:32.197 --> 23:33.448
I saw him!

23:34.817 --> 23:35.817
Saw who?

23:35.951 --> 23:38.820
The one who makes this happen.

23:41.874 --> 23:43.374
He's here.

23:48.671 --> 23:50.088
I need to talk to Sean. Where is he?

23:50.172 --> 23:51.389
- W-we have him right here, Claire.
- I've looked everywhere,

23:51.507 --> 23:52.724
and I need you to ask him
what he's done with Henry.

23:52.841 --> 23:55.340
I need you to ask him
what he has done with my son.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.641
Sir. I think you should see this.

24:00.645 --> 24:03.146
Oh, my God. Henry.

24:03.281 --> 24:04.147
Where is this?

24:04.282 --> 24:06.316
Flood control, access point 4,

24:06.450 --> 24:08.401
underneath the cooling towers.

24:10.871 --> 24:13.039
Sean, Sean, I don't know
what you're doing here,

24:13.157 --> 24:15.325
but I need you to leave Henry out of it.

24:15.409 --> 24:16.409
Please.

24:16.494 --> 24:18.044
Please, I am begging you!

24:18.162 --> 24:19.329
W-who is that in there, huh?!

24:19.463 --> 24:20.664
Huh?! Who is that in there?!

24:23.417 --> 24:24.501
What's going on?

24:26.337 --> 24:28.638
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on!

24:28.739 --> 24:31.057
Emergency lights on. We've got a man down.

24:31.175 --> 24:33.510
Where's Sean? Where'd he go?

24:35.513 --> 24:36.930
Henry.

24:39.150 --> 24:40.733
What the hell is happening?!

24:40.851 --> 24:42.402
Hello?!

24:44.188 --> 24:46.739
Is anybody out there, please?!

24:51.829 --> 24:53.696
I got nothing.

24:53.831 --> 24:56.666
You got a reading on the core?

24:56.750 --> 24:59.452
Water's tripped to level 3.

24:59.537 --> 25:01.421
What do we do?

25:05.292 --> 25:06.543
All right.

25:06.627 --> 25:08.127
That was the control room.

25:08.212 --> 25:09.746
We just scrammed the fuel rods.

25:09.847 --> 25:11.414
So it's contained?

25:11.515 --> 25:13.650
Think of it like a boiling pot of water.

25:13.751 --> 25:16.219
You turn off the stove, how long
before you can stick your hand in it?

25:16.320 --> 25:19.022
The temperature inside is 3,500 degrees.

25:19.106 --> 25:22.558
The pressure from the heat
is 1,200 PSI and rising.

25:22.643 --> 25:25.228
The power outage means we can't
open the valves to release it.

25:25.329 --> 25:26.562
We're talking about

25:26.647 --> 25:29.282
the very real possibility
of a full meltdown.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.467
We talking evacuation?

25:31.568 --> 25:33.453
6-mile radius.

25:33.570 --> 25:35.321
I'll call it in.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.990
All right, while that's in motion,

25:38.075 --> 25:41.294
there's one last thing
we can do on our end.

25:41.411 --> 25:42.578
Flood the reactor.

25:42.663 --> 25:44.213
How? I thought you said that that wasn't...

25:44.298 --> 25:45.581
it's the last line of defense.

25:45.666 --> 25:47.049
We open the floodgates up by hand

25:47.134 --> 25:49.218
and we bring the water
directly in from the chesapeake.

25:49.303 --> 25:50.503
Like they did at Fukushima?

25:50.587 --> 25:51.754
Exactly.

25:51.889 --> 25:54.757
All that saltwater... we'll lose the plant,

25:54.892 --> 25:56.309
but hopefully, that'll prevent us

25:56.426 --> 25:57.843
from losing a hell of a lot more.

25:57.928 --> 26:00.146
Wes, Henry is still inside.

26:00.264 --> 26:02.014
He is in one of those pipes.

26:02.099 --> 26:03.399
I'll notify my team inside.

26:03.433 --> 26:04.684
Hopefully, they'll get to him in time.

26:04.768 --> 26:05.735
Hopefully?!

26:05.819 --> 26:07.320
No, no, no, you have to let me...

26:07.437 --> 26:08.838
Claire? Claire!

26:27.357 --> 26:29.024
D-Drill?

26:30.460 --> 26:31.927
Are you here?

26:34.231 --> 26:36.732
Drill, I don't think
I like this game anymore.

26:36.833 --> 26:38.217
Where are you going?

26:38.301 --> 26:39.969
- I'm not leaving.
- Claire, come back inside.

26:40.053 --> 26:42.104
- Not with Henry still inside.
- Claire.

26:44.024 --> 26:45.307
I'm going in, Wes.

26:45.392 --> 26:46.976
The emergency response team
is sweeping the facility.

26:47.110 --> 26:48.227
- They will find him.
- Yeah?

26:48.311 --> 26:49.528
They will take care of him.
That is their job.

26:49.646 --> 26:50.863
And what if they don't? What if
he's part of Sean's plan?

26:50.981 --> 26:51.864
I can't just let him...

26:51.982 --> 26:53.198
Just...

26:53.316 --> 26:54.867
I will not let you go inside.

26:54.985 --> 26:57.236
- Let me go, Wes.
- No.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.654
Henry...

26:58.788 --> 27:02.041
He is all I have left.

27:03.376 --> 27:04.660
Not all.

27:07.464 --> 27:09.415
Let me go. Let me go.

27:15.638 --> 27:17.890
Just buy me some time.

27:18.007 --> 27:19.558
Okay.

27:19.676 --> 27:20.976
I'll do what I can.

27:21.060 --> 27:22.177
Here.

27:22.262 --> 27:24.763
Take this.

27:24.848 --> 27:26.849
I'll be with you the whole way.

28:02.198 --> 28:03.498
The area surrounding the Harbor Point

28:03.583 --> 28:06.081
nuclear power plant
is being quietly evacuated.

28:06.281 --> 28:07.581
Now, while authorities tell us it's just

28:07.682 --> 28:09.683
a precautionary measure
until they can sort out...

28:11.920 --> 28:13.687
You're not in trouble, sweetheart.

28:13.788 --> 28:15.389
I just want to know if you have

28:15.473 --> 28:17.925
any information that might help daddy...

28:18.009 --> 28:20.761
anything about what your friend Drill

28:20.845 --> 28:22.763
might have been trying to do over there.

28:22.847 --> 28:24.098
He didn't say...

28:24.182 --> 28:26.767
just that it was where
the first game would end.

28:26.851 --> 28:29.153
And what happens when the game ends?

28:29.270 --> 28:31.605
Everybody gets what they want.

28:41.166 --> 28:43.000
You have got to be kidding me.

28:43.117 --> 28:44.451
Did you really just let her go in there?

28:44.536 --> 28:46.453
Just do me a favor. We need to
hold them off from calling it.

28:46.588 --> 28:47.504
You know that's not gonna happen.

28:47.622 --> 28:48.872
It's her kid.

28:48.957 --> 28:51.158
And I appreciate the hell out of that,

28:51.259 --> 28:52.459
but it's one kid.

28:52.594 --> 28:55.462
Are you really willing to risk the lives

28:55.597 --> 28:57.798
of hundreds, maybe thousands for one kid?

29:02.637 --> 29:03.770
Where are you taking me?

29:03.855 --> 29:05.605
What happened to the other man
who was in there?

29:05.690 --> 29:07.057
We need to keep moving, ma'am.

29:07.141 --> 29:09.443
Any questions you have will be
answered once we're off-site.

29:53.788 --> 29:55.455
He's here.

30:07.835 --> 30:10.003
"Now you aren't just warm. You're hot.

30:10.087 --> 30:13.973
Wait here where 'x' marks the spot."

30:23.517 --> 30:25.218
You promised if I played the game,

30:25.352 --> 30:26.953
my dad would come back.

30:27.054 --> 30:30.139
So... Where is he?

30:30.224 --> 30:31.307
Where are you?

30:31.392 --> 30:32.475
I need you to give me some kind of marker

30:32.560 --> 30:33.726
so I can orient you on the map.

30:33.811 --> 30:36.396
Ground floor. I'm in a wide hallway.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.897
I see a blue tank up ahead.

30:38.032 --> 30:39.315
Okay, is it labeled with anything?

30:39.400 --> 30:42.652
Yes... "CPV H. Exchange."

30:42.736 --> 30:44.070
CPV... CPV...

30:44.154 --> 30:45.321
CPV... Yeah.

30:45.406 --> 30:47.457
It's the common pressure vessel.
It's the heat exchange.

30:47.574 --> 30:48.441
Turn left.

30:50.878 --> 30:53.713
Okay, the pipe that Henry was in
leads to something called the...

30:54.798 --> 30:56.132
the borate containment area.

30:56.250 --> 30:57.300
That's what you're looking for.

30:57.418 --> 30:58.835
Borate containment. Any idea what that...

30:58.919 --> 31:00.920
it's... it's where they treat
the saltwater with chemicals

31:01.055 --> 31:02.422
before they inject into the core.

31:02.556 --> 31:03.639
Claire, you have to get Henry out of there

31:03.757 --> 31:05.091
before they start the flooding, or...

31:05.225 --> 31:06.976
I know! I know, Wes! Just get me there!

31:07.094 --> 31:08.861
We're at 14 inches
above top of active fuel.

31:08.962 --> 31:10.513
PSI is 1,300.

31:10.597 --> 31:12.265
Okay, we're gonna get you out of there.

31:12.349 --> 31:13.433
We're gonna take care of you

31:13.517 --> 31:15.351
and make sure you're both safe.

31:15.435 --> 31:17.570
I'm in some kind of engine room.

31:17.654 --> 31:20.156
I see pipes... pipes with green labels,

31:20.274 --> 31:21.941
"inflow," "outflow."

31:22.075 --> 31:23.993
Okay, good. That's, uh,
the re-circ junction.

31:24.111 --> 31:26.779
Just... just follow those pipes forward.

31:26.864 --> 31:27.947
All right.

31:28.031 --> 31:29.615
The evacuation is complete.
We're good to go.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.033
Give the order. We'll open the floodgates.

31:31.118 --> 31:32.168
Okay.

31:32.286 --> 31:33.419
Claire, wait.

31:35.122 --> 31:37.256
Excuse me, but the bureau's
gonna need a few more details

31:37.341 --> 31:39.675
before we officially cut power
to half our nation's capital.

31:43.797 --> 31:44.880
Wes?

31:44.965 --> 31:47.166
Claire, listen to me.
We don't have much time.

31:57.778 --> 31:58.978
23!

31:59.112 --> 32:00.529
24! Okay, keep going.

32:00.647 --> 32:02.815
- What am I looking for?!
- 27.

32:02.949 --> 32:04.733
I'm in!

32:04.818 --> 32:06.952
Okay, that's great. Go right.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.329
- Up or down?
- What?

32:17.414 --> 32:19.048
I'm at a stairwell. Up or down?

32:19.132 --> 32:20.833
Uh, uh...

32:20.967 --> 32:21.917
G-go up.

32:22.002 --> 32:23.219
Go up.

32:23.336 --> 32:24.720
It should be right ahead of you.

32:24.838 --> 32:26.922
We're gonna make it!

32:27.007 --> 32:27.923
You see him?

32:29.876 --> 32:30.733
- Where?
- The room... It should

32:30.758 --> 32:31.584
be right in front of you.

32:33.229 --> 32:34.396
Wes, there's nothing there.

32:34.481 --> 32:35.514
That's impossible.

32:35.599 --> 32:36.682
I'm looking at the map.

32:36.766 --> 32:38.684
Claire, it should be right in front of you.

32:38.768 --> 32:40.786
No, there has to be another way.

32:54.367 --> 32:56.535
Water's at 12 inches
above top of active fuel.

32:56.636 --> 32:57.753
PSI is 1,350.

32:57.871 --> 32:59.705
- I-I need a few more minutes.
- Wes.

32:59.839 --> 33:01.540
11 inches above top of active fuel.

33:01.641 --> 33:03.542
PSI is 1,400. Look, if we
don't flood it right now,

33:03.676 --> 33:05.627
everything within 4 miles
of here will be wasteland!

33:08.681 --> 33:10.215
Claire, we're out of time.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.885
No! No, I'm almost...

33:12.986 --> 33:15.185
Claire, you need to get yourself out of
there in case the flooding doesn't work.

33:15.187 --> 33:17.105
- Do you understand me?
- Wes, please!

33:17.223 --> 33:19.224
I can't. I tried. I'm sorry. Henry?

33:19.309 --> 33:20.943
Henry? Henry?!

33:36.542 --> 33:38.577
Henr...

33:38.711 --> 33:41.079
I am not leaving him, Wes.

33:42.682 --> 33:44.783
I won't let him die alone.

33:44.884 --> 33:46.835
10 inches above top of active fuel.

33:46.919 --> 33:49.755
We're a go.

33:52.759 --> 33:54.192
Copy. We're a go.

33:56.362 --> 33:57.646
Claire...

33:57.764 --> 33:58.930
Wes, I can't hear you.

33:59.015 --> 34:00.482
- Claire?
- What?!

34:01.567 --> 34:02.601
We're almost out of range.

34:02.735 --> 34:04.269
I'm not gonna be able to help you anymore.

34:07.340 --> 34:10.826
I don't know if you can hear me...

34:10.943 --> 34:12.110
But I'm

34:12.245 --> 34:14.713
I'm sorry.

34:16.449 --> 34:19.050
I'm sorry for...

34:19.150 --> 34:21.753
For everything.

34:24.290 --> 34:26.091
I don't want to lose you, Claire.

34:37.469 --> 34:38.553
Daddy!

35:09.435 --> 35:10.568
1,450 PSI and rising.

35:10.669 --> 35:12.553
We're only 6 inches
above top of active fuel.

35:12.671 --> 35:14.555
We flooded the core. Why isn't
the water level going up?

35:14.673 --> 35:16.541
Looks like somehow
the flood never made it there.

35:16.642 --> 35:17.909
How is that possible?

35:18.010 --> 35:20.845
The only way is if someone
stopped it manually...

35:20.930 --> 35:22.180
From the inside.

35:22.264 --> 35:24.983
That's why Sean had to be here...

35:25.067 --> 35:27.101
so that we couldn't stop it.

35:28.187 --> 35:29.787
God help us.

35:31.490 --> 35:33.408
Henry. Henry.

36:27.079 --> 36:28.746
Claire!!

36:42.928 --> 36:45.596
Can someone tell me
what the hell I just saw?

36:51.093 --> 36:54.179
He never mentioned who he was working with?

36:54.263 --> 36:55.597
No.

36:58.601 --> 36:59.768
How about when you got inside?

36:59.852 --> 37:01.936
He never... Spoke with anyone?

37:02.071 --> 37:03.521
No.

37:03.606 --> 37:05.006
Nobody.

37:05.107 --> 37:09.444
You know, doctor...

37:09.528 --> 37:11.446
Most hostages...

37:11.530 --> 37:13.698
they usually can't stop
talking about their captors.

37:13.782 --> 37:15.049
You, on the other hand,

37:15.150 --> 37:17.502
you don't have a thing to say about yours.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.087
What do you want me to say?

37:19.121 --> 37:21.589
Prove to me that you were
actually his hostage

37:21.674 --> 37:23.124
and not his accomplice.

37:24.927 --> 37:26.544
Do you think I had anything to do with...

37:26.628 --> 37:28.212
you saw what happened out there, right?

37:29.465 --> 37:30.965
Right now, we don't know what to think.

37:31.050 --> 37:32.683
Well, neither did he!

37:32.801 --> 37:33.801
Okay?

37:33.886 --> 37:35.937
He gave me his gun.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.807
He told me to shoot him
if he did something bad.

37:39.942 --> 37:41.526
What kind of terrorist does that?

37:41.643 --> 37:43.694
Then how do you explain...

37:43.812 --> 37:47.615
Electrical fences powering down
when he got close,

37:47.699 --> 37:49.617
locked doors opening up like magic?

37:49.701 --> 37:51.071
How do you...

37:51.100 --> 37:52.900
Something happened here today.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.800
But if you think I am the
one who can explain it to you...

37:56.875 --> 37:58.075
then...

37:59.711 --> 38:03.047
then the FBI is even
worse off than I thought.

38:42.204 --> 38:43.421
Here they are!

38:43.538 --> 38:46.090
Move left!

38:46.208 --> 38:47.758
I said move left!

38:47.876 --> 38:49.426
Freeze!

38:49.544 --> 38:52.096
Let me go! No! No, I need to...

38:52.214 --> 38:53.193
Are you experiencing any stinging

38:53.218 --> 38:53.988
- in your eyes?
- Let me go!

38:54.049 --> 38:56.267
- I need to be with my son right now!
- How is your breathing?

38:56.384 --> 38:58.469
Let me go! He can't hear you!

38:58.553 --> 39:00.304
He can't understand you! Please let me go!

39:00.388 --> 39:01.939
- This guy's clean, too.
- Please!

39:04.776 --> 39:06.694
Three people just walked out
of that facility.

39:06.778 --> 39:07.861
Are they...

39:07.896 --> 39:08.896
T-they're clean.

39:09.030 --> 39:11.065
Whole area is.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.399
Let me go!

39:12.484 --> 39:13.617
Hands up!

39:13.735 --> 39:14.952
- Calm down, ma'am. Relax, ma'am.
- No, stop!

39:15.070 --> 39:17.288
- Stop! He didn't do anything!
- He's a suspected terrorist.

39:17.405 --> 39:19.039
No, no, he's... my son
would've died in there if he...

39:19.124 --> 39:20.207
On your knees!

39:20.292 --> 39:22.209
- Please! Please stop!
- Quit struggling, ma'am.

39:22.293 --> 39:23.993
You need to listen to me! I'm...

39:24.018 --> 39:25.770
- I'm with the FBI!
- Miss, please!

39:25.830 --> 39:27.247
Sean! Sean?

39:28.216 --> 39:29.583
Stop hurting him!!

39:34.923 --> 39:37.925
Henry? Henry? Henry?

39:39.561 --> 39:40.728
Can you hear me?

39:46.568 --> 39:48.402
How is that possible?!

39:48.486 --> 39:50.487
It was supposed to be a secret.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.523
Whose secret?

39:53.608 --> 39:56.944
Between me and... Drill.

40:01.366 --> 40:04.167
Residents near a nuclear plant...

40:04.285 --> 40:06.870
Are now being let back in their
homes after a near disaster...

40:06.954 --> 40:09.957
Honey. Daddy's fine.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.191
He's coming home soon.

40:11.292 --> 40:12.559
I knew he would be.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.228

40:18.099 --> 40:20.934
Well, Drill didn't win.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.536
He was caught.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.888

40:24.972 --> 40:26.890
Sean Bennigan is now in

40:26.974 --> 40:28.642
It's like I said.

40:28.726 --> 40:31.812

40:36.305 --> 40:42.747
