01:22.430 --> 01:24.520
u know it's possible you might enjoy ur dates more

01:24.520 --> 01:34.090

01:35.840 --> 01:36.480
what do u say?

01:38.630 --> 01:42.630
too subtle? im saying,u might have a better time

01:43.020 --> 01:46.080
if u r seeing someone who had a plain form personality 

01:46.080 --> 01:47.970
or with even remotely age appropriate

01:48.320 --> 01:49.980

04:16.700 --> 04:18.860
i'm confused.

04:18.930 --> 04:22.000

05:40.060 --> 05:43.800
anyway, it turns out she has a friend who's newly single,

05:43.860 --> 05:44.960
and i suggested...

05:45.030 --> 05:47.600
a blind date? forget it.

05:47.660 --> 05:50.200
charlie harper does not go on blind dates.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.200
he doesn't?

05:51.260 --> 05:52.860
no, heoesn't.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.630
can't we ask him?

05:58.700 --> 06:00.730
don't bother.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.300
i know what he'll say.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.100
okay, but does he have to say it in the third person?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.960
look, i don't need anybody to get me dates.

06:09.030 --> 06:10.200
i can get my own dates

06:10.260 --> 06:11.760
yes, but you were complaining that the women

06:11.830 --> 06:13.660
you go out with don't fulfill you.

06:13.730 --> 06:16.730
donna's friend is beautiful,she's accomplished, she's smart.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.060
how old is she?

06:18.130 --> 06:19.800
i think around 40.

06:19.860 --> 06:21.200
hello.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.360
flippity-flappity flappity!

06:24.830 --> 06:27.160
still with the ears.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.730
it's not just ears.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.060
women that age have a lot of baggage.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.900
right. and you've just got a carry-on.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.130
think about this.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.860
what if i meet this woman

06:42.930 --> 06:45.460
i like her, she likes me,we get married and settle down?

06:46.530 --> 06:47.700
we're both 40 now.

06:48.530 --> 06:50.000
in 20 years,i gotta be 60

06:50.400 --> 06:52.130
and do you know in how old she'll gonna be?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.260
60?
60?

06:55.330 --> 06:57.360
i rest my case.

07:03.830 --> 07:05.000
that was nice, huh?

07:05.060 --> 07:06.630
i guess.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.930
my ear's still a little soggy.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.760
sorry

07:12.830 --> 07:14.830
so, "deedee."

07:14.900 --> 07:17.100

07:17.160 --> 07:18.860

07:18.930 --> 07:20.160
i don't know.

07:23.230 --> 07:25.300

07:25.360 --> 07:27.960
oh. well, what's your real name?

07:28.030 --> 07:30.300
sissy.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.630
sissy, huh?

07:32.700 --> 07:34.800
i guess that means you
throw a ball like a girl.

07:34.860 --> 07:37.000
i am a girl.

07:37.060 --> 07:40.830
right.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.730
is charlie short for anything?

07:43.800 --> 07:45.260
charles.

07:45.330 --> 07:48.830
oh. that's not really shorter, is it?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.400
excuse me.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.930
why?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.460
did you fart?

08:02.800 --> 08:04.700
no. you ha up first.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.430
okay, count three.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.060
one, two, three.

08:09.130 --> 08:11.230
you didn't hang up, did you?

08:11.300 --> 08:13.030
me neither.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.500
okay, set it up.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.030

08:22.100 --> 08:24.000
the blind date with the old chick. i'm in.

08:27.530 --> 08:29.830
what?

08:33.260 --> 08:35.360
alan, let's go!

08:35.429 --> 08:37.700
relax. we've got plenty of time.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.159
i just don't want to be late.

08:39.230 --> 08:41.460
i can't believe it.

08:41.530 --> 08:42.559
you're nervous about a date.

08:42.630 --> 08:44.560
of course i'm nervous.

08:44.630 --> 08:46.200
what am i going to talk to her about?

08:46.260 --> 08:49.500
i haven't gone out with a 40-year-old woman since high school.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.960
well, charlie, that's the great thing

08:55.030 --> 08:56.330
about seeing someone
your own age.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.830
there's always somhing
to talk about,

08:57.900 --> 09:00.060
because what you've been through, she's been through.

09:00.130 --> 09:03.900
oh, i hardly think so.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.500
all right. point taken.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.830
but she's a fascinating woman.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.100
she's a municipal court judge

09:08.160 --> 09:09.600
she teaches law at ucla.

09:09.660 --> 09:12.000
oh, man,
you didn't tell me that

09:12.060 --> 09:13.000
does that make a diffrence?

09:13.060 --> 09:14.200
it makes a big difference.

09:14.260 --> 09:15.600
the smarter the girl,

09:15.660 --> 09:18.200
the harder it is to blow smoke up her ass.

09:23.860 --> 09:26.030
you know,i'm already regretting this.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.360
and for good reason.

09:27.430 --> 09:28.600
let's just call it off.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.260
no, no, no. it's too late for that.

09:30.330 --> 09:33.400
just relax and...i don't know... be yourself.

09:33.460 --> 09:37.000
and, by "yourself," i mean someone else entirely.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.700
anything else?

09:38.760 --> 09:41.260
well, as long we've opened this particular can of worms,

09:41.330 --> 09:44.300
you might want
to rethink the bowling shirt.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.530
why?

09:46.600 --> 09:49.600
well, as i said, she's a judge and a law professor,

09:49.660 --> 09:52.730
and let's let's be honest,you don't bowl.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.460
all right. i'll go change.

09:55.530 --> 09:57.530
-and charlie? -yeah?

09:57.600 --> 09:58.930
while you're at it,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.560
why don't we go for the big boy pants?

10:03.260 --> 10:05.400
fine

10:08.600 --> 10:10.330
oh. there they're.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.500
hang on, hang on, hang on.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.100
which one's mine?

10:13.160 --> 10:15.460
the.. the one on the right.

10:15.530 --> 10:17.560
wow! she's 40?

10:17.630 --> 10:20.400
she has the ears of a 20-year-old.

10:23.130 --> 10:25.430
come on.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.160
did you think she had 'em done?

10:28.230 --> 10:30.030
sorry we're late.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.730
charlie couldn't decide what to wear.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.060
oh. i think he looks very nice.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.860

10:50.700 --> 10:55.000

10:55.160 --> 11:02.230
-and, quite frankly, i wasn't expect so...  -so what, charlie?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.960
uh  yummy 

11:06.260 --> 11:07.500

11:18.730 --> 11:21.100

i was expecting you to be...

11:23.160 --> 11:24.830

11:24.900 --> 11:26.130
dry 

11:26.200 --> 11:28.330

11:35.000 --> 11:37.500
oh, good lord. 

11:38.930 --> 11:40.860
you know what?  you know what?

11:40.930 --> 11:43.200

11:52.730 --> 11:54.700
you know, voluntarily.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.400
better?

12:02.460 --> 12:05.560
anything's better than "moist.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.160
so how do you know each other?

12:12.230 --> 12:14.060
oh, well, we met in the church choir,

12:14.130 --> 12:16.730
then we found out our kids were in the same preschool.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.100

12:39.460 --> 12:40.830

12:40.900 --> 12:42.900
why on earth would i want iced tea?

12:44.760 --> 12:47.830
because you don't drink alcohol during the daytime.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.000
oh, right.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.760
of course not.

13:13.030 --> 13:14.800

13:14.860 --> 13:16.660

13:37.630 --> 13:40.130
you know, alan, i got to hand it to you--

13:40.200 --> 13:41.630
linda is really something.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.460
yeah yeah, she's terrific.

13:43.530 --> 13:45.300
but let me ask you something.

13:46.960 --> 13:51.000
what in god's name possessed you to talk about pornography?

13:52.090 --> 13:53.520
hey she started it

13:54.360 --> 13:55.630
she wasn't talking about pornography.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.130
she was talking about constitutional law

13:57.200 --> 13:58.830
and the preservation of the first amendment.

13:58.900 --> 14:02.200
which includes pornography.

14:02.260 --> 14:05.930
yes, it does, but it does not include your favorite actresses,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.600
top ten dvd's or your beefs
about the bonus features.

14:09.660 --> 14:12.730
i just pointed out that the blooper though funny,

14:12.800 --> 14:14.930
are really more of a turnoff.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.130
yeah, yeah, hi donna.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.860
um, charlie and i were just talking

14:21.930 --> 14:23.630
about what a nice time we had.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.660
okay, i'm sorry.

14:27.830 --> 14:29.630
we... i'm sorry.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.460
ask her if linda likes me.

14:32.530 --> 14:33.560
h-hang on.

14:33.630 --> 14:34.800
you're kidding, right?

14:34.860 --> 14:37.030
come on, chicks talk to each other.

14:37.030 --> 14:40.260
uh, donna, would you please tell my brother

14:40.330 --> 14:42.330
what you just told me. here.

14:43.830 --> 14:46.100
hey, donna. talk to me.

14:48.830 --> 14:50.100
i see.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.160
okay, well, thanks for the heads-up.

14:53.230 --> 14:55.560
linda didn't like me.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.630
go figure.

14:58.860 --> 15:02.700
i told her notto drink the iced tea.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.360
that's what i heard...

15:07.430 --> 15:09.600
danny sholander likes jennifer denapoli.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.860
really? he's gay?

15:16.930 --> 15:19.360
does he know that?

15:19.430 --> 15:21.660
you got to get me another crack at her.

15:21.730 --> 15:23.830
what?

15:26.230 --> 15:28.360
linda. i-i can't let it end this way.

15:28.430 --> 15:29.830
let what end? it was a lunch.

15:29.900 --> 15:32.200
no, no, no, no, it was more than a lunch.

15:32.260 --> 15:34.660
it was a test:
is charlie harpel capable

15:34.730 --> 15:36.700
of stepping up to quality women?

15:36.760 --> 15:39.360
oh, god, we're back to third person.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.760
alan, i am tired of having meaningless sex

15:41.830 --> 15:43.300
with hot pinheads.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.630
what a coincidence--I'm tired of hearing about it.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.630
linda's smart,

15:47.700 --> 15:49.530
linda's sophisticated, linda's successful.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.630
linda doesn't like you.

15:51.630 --> 15:53.060
she will-- i can make her.

15:53.130 --> 15:54.560
you just need to tell donna

15:54.630 --> 15:56.530
to tell linda  to give me another chance.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.630
fine, i'll pass her a note during study hall.

16:00.130 --> 16:02.530
don't belittle my feelings.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.360
i'm in a very sensitive place,
and i will kick your ass.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.560
oh, come on, charlie, so you struck out with a woman.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.130
it happens.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.600
believe me... it happens.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.430
and when it does the best thing to do

16:14.500 --> 16:17.030
is to pick yourself up dust yourself off

16:17.100 --> 16:20.930
and curse god for making you the way you are.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.800
all right, forget it i don't need you.

16:22.860 --> 16:25.130
i'll call her myself.

16:31.430 --> 16:33.700
sorry about the "curse god" stuff

16:33.760 --> 16:37.500
but we both know i'm not your best work.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.630
yeah, hi. can i speak to judge linda ha||is, please?

16:44.700 --> 16:47.100

16:47.160 --> 16:49.800
yes, again.

16:49.860 --> 16:52.760
all right,fine put me through to voice mail.

16:52.830 --> 16:55.060
baging a judge won't
get you out of jury duty

16:55.130 --> 16:56.200
believe me, i've tried.

16:56.260 --> 16:58.930
quiet.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.160

anway, i know we didn't
get off on the right foot,

17:15.700 --> 17:18.230
but that's just because i'm not used to spending time

17:18.300 --> 17:20.300
with such a remarkable
and accomplished woman.

17:20.359 --> 17:21.560
keep shoveling.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.800
and it's true,

17:26.859 --> 17:29.660
i've lived a certain
kind of life up until now.

17:29.730 --> 17:32.060
i'm not saying that
i'm pr||d of it,

17:32.130 --> 17:34.030
but i'||m not ashamed
of it, either.

17:34.100 --> 17:38.800
why else would you have videotap|| most of it?

17:38.860 --> 17:41.360
i'm begging you.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.960
so,you want to call me back,

17:45.030 --> 17:46.460

17:46.530 --> 17:49.460

17:49.530 --> 17:54.100

if you called me.

17:55.130 --> 17:56.700
well...

17:56.760 --> 17:59.460
i never thought i'd see charlie harper on his knees.

you know, figuratively.

18:04.100 --> 18:08.100

18:08.470 --> 18:10.420
what's make the girl so special?

18:10.560 --> 18:11.830
a brain.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.430
what're you gonna do with a brain?

18:14.500 --> 18:17.560
it doesn't matter;
she'll never call me.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.560
oh, don't talk like that.

18:19.630 --> 18:21.260
just because she's
smart and succes||ul

18:21.330 --> 18:24.260
