WEBVTT

00:11.267 --> 00:13.467
- AGENT LOUIE,
DO YOU READ ME

00:13.500 --> 00:15.800
- LOUD AND CLEAR, CONTROL.

00:15.833 --> 00:18.133
- IS MISSION
"PRANK THE DELIVERY MAN" A GO?

00:18.167 --> 00:19.867
REPEAT

00:19.900 --> 00:21.667
- YES.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.700
ARE THE WALKIE-TALKIES
REALLY NECESSARY?

00:25.333 --> 00:26.767
- YES! NOW, COME ON.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.867
IT'S ALREADY ZERO-TWO-NINER.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.600
- DON'T KNOW.
I JUST LIKE SAYING NINER.

00:34.633 --> 00:37.600
- ALL RIGHT, SETTING
THE FINAL PIECE NOW.

00:41.733 --> 00:44.367
- SO...THE MEAN DELIVERY MAN
OPENS THE DOOR,

00:44.400 --> 00:46.333
PULLING BACK THE BOOT
WHICH KICKS THE BALL

00:46.367 --> 00:49.367
THAT SLIDES DOWN THE TUBE--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:49.400 --> 00:53.433
JUST WATCH.
GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.

00:53.467 --> 00:54.667
- NICE!
HA.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.833
- HERE HE COMES!
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

00:57.867 --> 01:00.767
NINER-NINER.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.567
- UH-OH...
- IT'S MOM!

01:06.600 --> 01:09.633
LOUIE, CAN'T YOU STOP IT?
- OF COURSE I CAN.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.700
OOPS.

01:20.433 --> 01:21.633
AHH...

01:22.633 --> 01:24.733
- AAH!

01:24.767 --> 01:27.533
OH!
WHA--

01:27.567 --> 01:28.733
AAH!

01:28.767 --> 01:29.800
WHOO!

01:34.767 --> 01:36.633
WHAT HAVE YOU KIDS DONE?!

01:36.667 --> 01:38.233
- DELIVERY!

01:49.533 --> 01:52.200
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

01:52.233 --> 01:54.867
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

01:54.900 --> 01:57.500
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

01:57.533 --> 02:00.933
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:00.967 --> 02:03.367
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:03.400 --> 02:04.800
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:04.833 --> 02:07.667
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:07.700 --> 02:10.533
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:10.567 --> 02:12.333
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:12.367 --> 02:16.367
*

02:16.400 --> 02:18.367
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:18.400 --> 02:20.267
*

02:24.600 --> 02:26.333
- KICKBALLS, BUCKETS,

02:26.367 --> 02:27.800
CHOCOLATE SYRUP?

02:27.833 --> 02:29.633
HOW COULD YOU GUYS DO THAT?

02:29.667 --> 02:32.500
- IT'S SIMPLE PHYSICS,
REALLY.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.167
- WELL, YOU GUYS
ARE IN BIG TROUBLE.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.600
- IT TOOK THREE RINSES

02:37.633 --> 02:39.567
TO GET THE CHOCOLATE
OUT OF MY HAIR.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.100
NOW BECAUSE OF YOU TWO,

02:41.133 --> 02:42.567
I HAVE TO OPEN THE BAKERY
AN HOUR LATE.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.067
AS A PROFESSIONAL
BUSINESSWOMAN,

02:44.100 --> 02:45.833
I HAVE STANDARDS TO KEEP UP,
YOU KNOW?

02:45.867 --> 02:48.833
OH, THERE'S THAT SPATULA...

02:51.467 --> 02:53.833
- WHAT MICHELLE'S
TRYING TO SAY--

02:53.867 --> 02:55.833
THE PRANKS HAVE GOTTEN
OUT OF CONTROL.

02:55.867 --> 02:58.767
NOW SIT THERE WHILE
WE DISCUSS PUNISHMENTS.

03:01.433 --> 03:04.267
TIME OUT, GROUNDING,
DOUBLE CHORES?

03:04.300 --> 03:06.233
COMBO PACK?

03:06.267 --> 03:07.567
- IF WE'RE GONNA FIX THIS,

03:07.600 --> 03:10.200
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.400
- OHH...I AM SO GLAD
YOU SAID THAT.

03:12.433 --> 03:14.633
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I LOVE LOUIE,

03:14.667 --> 03:16.667
BUT CLEARLY HE HASN'T BEEN
THE BEST INFLUENCE

03:16.700 --> 03:19.467
ON MY INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.700
I THINK YOUR TOWEL'S
TIED ON TOO TIGHT.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.700
FRANKIE'S THE PROBLEM.

03:26.733 --> 03:28.400
EVER SINCE SHE'S MOVED HERE,

03:28.433 --> 03:30.700
MY BOY'S BEEN NEGLECTING
HIS GHOST SCHOOLWORK.

03:30.733 --> 03:34.400
- YOU'RE REALLY NOT TRYING
TO SAY THAT MY BABY IS TO BLAME.

03:34.433 --> 03:36.167
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO SAY ANYTHING.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.700
I SAID IT!

03:37.733 --> 03:39.067
WELL, MAYBE IT WOULD BE BEST

03:39.100 --> 03:40.500
IF THE KIDS HAD A BREAK
FROM EACH OTHER,

03:40.533 --> 03:42.100
GIVE THEM A CHANCE
TO MEET OTHER PEOPLE,

03:42.133 --> 03:43.333
MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

03:43.367 --> 03:44.733
- FINE.
- DOUBLE FINE!

03:44.767 --> 03:46.333
- HMPH!
- SCHOOLED.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.500
- ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.833
WE HAVE DECIDED WHAT YOU NEED
IS SOME TIME APART.

03:51.867 --> 03:54.300
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
WE'RE A TEAM.

03:54.333 --> 03:58.633
- YEAH, FRANKIE'S MY BUDDY
AND I'M HER ROLE MODEL.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.367
- IT'S NOT FOREVER--

04:00.400 --> 04:02.667
JUST UNTIL YOU GUYS
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.267
NOW, LET'S GO.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.133
- COME ON,
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.900
YOU CAN GO BACK TO BEING
MY KIND, HELPFUL LITTLE GIRL.

04:12.933 --> 04:15.767
- OH...

04:15.800 --> 04:17.633
YOU ARE SO SILLY.
IF YOU WEREN'T

04:17.667 --> 04:19.433
SUCH A SWEET KID,
WOULD YOU HAVE BOUGHT ME

04:19.467 --> 04:21.833
THAT WONDERFUL SHAMPOO
THAT I JUST USED?

04:21.867 --> 04:25.467
FYI, LOVING THE MINTY SCENT.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.733
- I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING!

04:36.567 --> 04:38.333
- YES, I'M OKAY.
WHY WOULDN'T BE OKAY?

04:38.367 --> 04:41.167
I LIKE YOUR BOW TIE.
WELL, GOTTA GO--SEE YA!

04:44.133 --> 04:47.567
- WHY DO I FEEL LIKE SHE WAS
HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME?

04:47.600 --> 04:49.633
- MILES,
YOU SHOULDN'T LOOK INSIDE.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.267
YOU'D BE INVADING
TAYLOR'S PRIVACY.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.467
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I HAVE TO MILDLY DISAGREE.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.367
- WAIT--AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE A DEVIL?

04:58.400 --> 05:00.267
- FOR YOU,
I'M AS BAD AS IT GETS.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.800
MY BOW TIE'S CROOKED,

05:01.833 --> 05:04.533
AND I RETURN LIBRARY BOOKS
LATE.

05:04.567 --> 05:07.167
- HOW DO YOU LIVE
WITH YOURSELF?

05:08.633 --> 05:10.733
TOTAL BAD BOY.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.233
ANYHOO, IF TAYLOR'S
HIDING SOMETHING,

05:14.267 --> 05:15.667
SHE MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE.

05:15.700 --> 05:18.367
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

05:22.533 --> 05:23.900
"DEAR TAYLOR,

05:23.933 --> 05:25.867
"WE ARE WRITING
TO INVITE YOU TO HARKEN SCHOOL

05:25.900 --> 05:27.900
"WHERE WE FEEL YOU WOULD
MAKE A SUPERB ADDITION

05:27.933 --> 05:30.633
TO OUR CHAMPIONSHIP
GYMNASTICS PROGRAM."

05:30.667 --> 05:33.700
TAYLOR'S THINKING
OF GOING TO A BOARDING SCHOOL?

05:33.733 --> 05:35.733
IN VIRGINIA?

05:35.767 --> 05:38.433
- THIS IS SHOCKING.

05:38.467 --> 05:39.767
I FEEL FAINT.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.200
- IT MUST BE THEIR GREAT
GYMNASTICS PROGRAM...

05:44.233 --> 05:46.333
GUYS, IF WE WANT TAYLOR
TO STAY IN NEW ORLEANS,

05:46.367 --> 05:48.067
WE'VE GOTTA MAKE HER TEAM
BETTER.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.367
- ABSOLUTELY!

05:49.400 --> 05:51.333
- COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT
BETTER MYSELF!

05:51.367 --> 05:53.567
- IT'S UNANIMOUS THEN.
THANKS, GUYS.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.433
NOW...GROUP HUG!

06:07.567 --> 06:10.900
- OH, JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

06:10.933 --> 06:13.667
WHAT'S THE SECRET PASSWORD?

06:13.700 --> 06:16.767
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ALL THE KNOCKING WAS?

06:18.533 --> 06:22.633
- I JUST THOUGHT WE WERE
LAYING DOWN A NICE BEAT.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.733
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA KEEP US APART?

06:25.767 --> 06:28.467
- NO IDEA.
THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.467
WE'RE A TEAM.
FRANKIE AND LOUIE.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.467
FOUIE.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.733
- YOU MEAN LOUIE AND FRANKIE.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.800
LOUKIE.

06:38.833 --> 06:43.067
- YEAH, THAT'S JUST AS CATCHY.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.833
I MISS
HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

06:44.867 --> 06:47.600
I WISH YOUR DAD
WASN'T SO STRICT.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.367
MY DAD'S ALL GOOD.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.133
YOUR MOM'S THE ONE
WHO FREAKED OUT

06:52.167 --> 06:54.333
OVER A HARMLESS PRANK.

06:54.367 --> 06:55.800
- PLEASE!
RAY'S THE ONE

06:55.833 --> 06:57.767
WHO WENT ALL NUTS
WITH THE PUNISHMENT.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.700
- IF THERE'S ANYBODY
WHO GOES NUTS, IT'S MICHELLE.

07:00.733 --> 07:02.700
THERE. I SAID IT!

07:04.300 --> 07:06.767
- CAREFUL, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY MOM!

07:06.800 --> 07:09.433
- AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
MY DAD!

07:09.467 --> 07:11.133
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:11.167 --> 07:12.633
MAYBE MY DAD WAS RIGHT.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.567
MAYBE YOU ARE A BAD INFLUENCE.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.667
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE
A BAD GHOST.

07:16.700 --> 07:20.400
- COULD A BAD GHOST TURN HIMSELF
INTO A GIGANTIC TARANTULA?

07:22.733 --> 07:24.200
- I'M OUTTA HERE.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.900
WITHOUT ME,
YOU'LL HAVE NO ONE TO TALK TO

07:27.933 --> 07:29.600
BUT YOUR COLLECTION
OF MANNEQUIN HEADS.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.767
- WELL, WITHOUT ME
YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO

07:34.800 --> 07:36.600
BUT TURN YOURSELF INTO POULTRY,

07:36.633 --> 07:39.633
AND FYI, YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS!

07:45.867 --> 07:48.300
- WHOO! HA HA!
ALL RIGHT, TAYLOR!

07:48.333 --> 07:50.200
- NICE GOING, TAY.
GREAT ROUTINE.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.467
- THANKS.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.167
- SCORES FOR TAYLOR HATHAWAY...

07:53.200 --> 07:55.267
9, 9, 9,

07:55.300 --> 07:57.600
AND A PERFECT 10!

07:59.233 --> 08:00.900
- I THINK OUR TEAM
MAY HAVE A SHOT AT WINNING.

08:00.933 --> 08:03.167
- I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.133
- SHE DOES KNOW WHICH SIDE

08:09.167 --> 08:11.733
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO STAND ON,
RIGHT?

08:16.267 --> 08:17.633
- THAT'S IT.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.467
TIME TO TURN THIS
INTO A CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.867
- NEXT UP, EMMA HAWKING
ON BALANCE BEAM.

08:58.167 --> 09:00.900
- SHE JUST DID
A PERFECT ROUTINE.

09:00.933 --> 09:03.533
WE NEVER WIN!

09:03.567 --> 09:05.300
- I DON'T KNOW HOW I DID IT.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.367
IT MUST BE MY NEW
BREAKFAST CEREAL--

09:07.400 --> 09:09.533
SUGAR FROSTED
MARSHMALLOW BITS!

09:09.567 --> 09:12.533
AND MY MOM SAID IT WAS
NO BETTER THAN CANDY.

09:18.833 --> 09:21.133
- FRANKIE HAS A PLAY DATE.

09:21.167 --> 09:24.333
AND THIS CHESTER--
SUCH A WELL-BEHAVED BOY.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.400
- WELL, WITHOUT CERTAIN
DISTRACTIONS,

09:28.433 --> 09:30.800
LOUIE'S REALLY IMPROVED
HIS GHOST TRICKS.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.800
I MAY HAVE A TRUE SCHOLAR
ON MY HANDS.

09:33.833 --> 09:36.433
DAD? WHEN YOU GET A SEC...

09:38.733 --> 09:41.533
- YOU MUST BE SO PROUD.

09:44.267 --> 09:46.467
- IT TOOK ME FOUR YEARS
TO PUT TOGETHER

09:46.500 --> 09:47.867
MY ROCK COLLECTION.

09:47.900 --> 09:51.200
THESE HERE ARE MADE FROM
VOLCANIC MAGMA.

09:51.233 --> 09:52.533
THAT REMINDS ME--

09:52.567 --> 09:55.400
WHAT DID THE BOY VOLCANO
SAY TO THE GIRL VOLCANO?

09:57.400 --> 09:59.567
- "I LAVA YOU."

09:59.600 --> 10:01.233
GET IT?
LAVA!

10:01.267 --> 10:02.600
HA HA HA HA!

10:04.267 --> 10:08.800
- LAVA! OH, CHESTER,
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

10:10.733 --> 10:15.400
ROUGHHOUSING WITH SOMEONE'S
SEMI-PRECIOUS STONE COLLECTION.

10:15.433 --> 10:17.767
IF I SHOW YOU MY RUBIES,

10:17.800 --> 10:21.267
I NEED TO KNOW...
YOU'LL BE GENTLE.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.333
- 'KAY...

10:25.367 --> 10:27.733
- BACK IN A NANOSECOND!

10:30.333 --> 10:32.767
- DON'T MIND ME.
JUST PASSING THROUGH.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.133
- SORRY IF MY NEW BESTIE
AND I

10:35.167 --> 10:37.267
ARE LAUGHING TOO LOUD.

10:37.300 --> 10:41.100
THAT'S JUST SAD.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.700
MORE LIKE AWESOME.

10:43.733 --> 10:46.300
IN FACT,
WE'VE COME UP WITH A NICKNAME--

10:46.333 --> 10:48.667
CHESTER AND FRANKIE:

10:48.700 --> 10:51.367
CHANKIE.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.833
- BUT THE NICKNAME
WAS OUR THING.

10:53.867 --> 10:58.333
- WHO'S READY TO INSPECT
SOME RUBIES?!

10:58.367 --> 11:01.133
- YOU THINK YOU CAN REPLACE
THE L

11:01.167 --> 11:02.467
GOOD LUCK!

11:02.500 --> 11:04.233
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU
ANYWAY,

11:04.267 --> 11:06.800
NOT WITH ALL THE FUN
I'M HAVING.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.467
- GOOD POINT.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.433
WHAT'S YOUR NEW FRIEND'S
NAME AGAIN?

11:10.467 --> 11:12.633
OH...THAT'S RIGHT.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.133
YOU DON'T HAVE ONE.

11:14.167 --> 11:15.800
- OH,
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

11:15.833 --> 11:18.767
I'M ONE POPULAR DUDE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:18.800 --> 11:20.567
FORGET ABOUT
OUR TEMPORARY BREAK.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.700
YOU AND ME ARE DONE!

11:22.733 --> 11:24.467
ADIOS, "CHANKIE!"

11:27.167 --> 11:29.133
TOTALLY ON PURPOSE!

11:35.367 --> 11:37.133
- OH. HELLO.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.333
- SORRY.

11:38.367 --> 11:40.667
JUST WANT TO GET
THE PAPER.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.167
- IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.
HOW'S LOUIE?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.433
- STUDIOUS AS EVER.
FRANKIE?

11:45.467 --> 11:46.733
- OH, COULDN'T BE BETTER.

11:46.767 --> 11:50.567
I JUST LOVE SEEING
THAT SPRING IN HER STEP.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.267
HEY, THERE, BRIGHT EYES.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.100
WHAT EXCITING ACTIVITY
DO YOU AND CHESTER

11:54.133 --> 11:55.733
HAVE PLANNED FOR TOMORROW?

11:55.767 --> 11:58.600
- WE'RE GOING TO THE PARK
TO LOOK AT GRAVEL.

11:58.633 --> 12:01.233
- FUNZIES!

12:01.267 --> 12:04.833
- IT WAS BETWEEN THAT OR GOING
SHOE-SHOPPING WITH HIS MOM.

12:12.233 --> 12:14.667
- HO HO!
DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D BE HERE.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.400
- STATE YOUR BUSINESS.

12:16.433 --> 12:20.067
I'M MEMORIZING THE 12
DIFFERENT TYPES OF GRAVEL.

12:20.067 --> 12:24.667
WHICH I AM LOVING!

12:24.700 --> 12:26.300
- HEY, WHILE YOU'RE HERE

12:26.333 --> 12:29.600
WHY DON'T YOU SAY HI
TO MY NEW BEST FRIEND?

12:29.633 --> 12:31.767
FRANKIE, MEET TWOUIE.

12:34.533 --> 12:37.067
- PLEASED TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

12:38.767 --> 12:41.333
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

12:41.367 --> 12:45.067
- TWOUIE'S WAY MORE MATURE
AND SMARTER THAN CHESTER.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.333
TELL HER WHAT WE'VE BEEN
UP TO, TWOUIE.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.067
- WELL, WE'VE HAD
A JOLLY GOOD TIME!

12:49.100 --> 12:51.067
WE WENT BIRD-WATCHING,
PLAYED CHESS,

12:51.100 --> 12:53.500
THEN PUT ON
A FANCY CONCERT.

12:53.533 --> 12:55.433
I PLAY THE FRENCH HORN!

12:58.633 --> 13:01.367
- AT LEAST CHESTER'S
A REAL FRIEND,

13:01.400 --> 13:04.133
NOT SOMETHING I MADE
IN A COPY MACHINE.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.800
- HOW RUDE!

13:05.833 --> 13:07.533
LOUIE, PLEASE TELL ME
"FRESH MOUTH"

13:07.567 --> 13:09.567
ISN'T GOING
BIRD WATCHING WITH US.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.267
- NOPE.
JUST US.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.700
- HUZZAH!

13:16.733 --> 13:18.733
THE MORNING LOON AWAITS!

13:18.767 --> 13:22.967
OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH,
AH-AH-AH-AH.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.500
OH, YEAH...
FINE GRAVEL, LAG GRAVEL,

13:28.533 --> 13:30.533
PEA GRAVEL...

13:32.767 --> 13:37.067
OUR KIDS HAVE TURNED INTO
ZOMBIES AND WEIRDOS.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.433
- LET'S FACE IT.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.067
THEY'RE MISERABLE
WITHOUT EACH OTHER.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.067
- WE'VE GOTTA GET THEM BACK
TOGETHER.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.533
- AND LET'S DO IT FAST BEFORE
MILES SEES TWOUIE'S OUTFIT.

13:44.567 --> 13:47.433
HE'LL DEFINITELY
WANT TO GET ONE.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE WON AGAIN!

13:53.067 --> 13:54.433
THAT'S THREE TIMES IN A ROW!

13:54.467 --> 13:56.633
- YEAH, THANKS TO ME.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.633
- AND, OF COURSE, ME.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.233
- ALL OF US HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT, EMMA.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.133
- TAYLOR, SWEETIE,

14:03.167 --> 14:05.533
IF ALL OF US WERE ON
THE BALANCE BEAM TOGETHER,

14:05.567 --> 14:07.367
WE'D BE DISQUALIFIED.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.400
UH...DOY!

14:10.433 --> 14:12.700
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT--
- SPEAKING OF ME

14:12.733 --> 14:14.467
BEING AWESOME,

14:14.500 --> 14:16.567
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU GUYS
ABOUT UPPING YOUR SCORES.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.133
I'VE BEEN SCORING 10s,

14:18.167 --> 14:20.200
AND YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
SCORING 8s AND 9s.

14:20.233 --> 14:22.100
- WHICH ARE PRETTY GOOD SCORES,
EMMA.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.667
- TAYLOR,
ARE 9s BETTER THAN 10s?

14:24.700 --> 14:28.200
ARE THEY?

14:28.233 --> 14:31.600
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T KNOW.
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME?

14:31.633 --> 14:33.467
- 10s ARE BETTER.

14:35.233 --> 14:36.733
- BETTER WATCH OUT, TAYLOR.

14:36.767 --> 14:40.067
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE'LL WANT TO BE CAPTAIN.

14:40.067 --> 14:42.367
- SOPHIE'S RIGHT.
I SHOULD BE CAPTAIN.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.067
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I--
- TAYLOR,

14:44.067 --> 14:48.200
I CHALLENGE YOU TO A ONE-ON-ONE
GYMNASTICS DUEL,

14:48.233 --> 14:49.467
5:00 AT THE GYM.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.267
WINNER GETS TO BE CAPTAIN.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.233
THIS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

14:54.267 --> 14:56.767
- 5:00. BE THERE
OR BE A CIRCLE.

15:04.233 --> 15:06.100
AREN'T YOU GLAD YOUR TEAM'S
FINALLY WINNING?

15:06.133 --> 15:09.567
- MILES, I LIKE WINNING,
BUT NOW IT'S DIFFERENT.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.067
EMMA'S CHANGED.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.067
I FEEL LIKE
I'M LOSING A FRIEND.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.367
- BUT YOU'VE GAINED
A MEDAL.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.400
I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE TEAM
IF IT'S NOT FUN ANYMORE.

15:21.433 --> 15:24.367
WA-WAIT--

15:24.400 --> 15:28.333
BUT I THOUGHT
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED!

15:28.367 --> 15:31.267
- GREETINGS, MILES!
- LOUIE, I'VE GOT A BIG PROBLEM.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.600
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--

15:32.633 --> 15:36.400
OOH, THAT IS A NICE OUTFIT.

15:36.433 --> 15:39.467
WHAT IS THAT, ITALIAN WOOL?
- IT SURE IS!

15:41.600 --> 15:44.500
- KIDS, THE REASON WHY
WE CALLED YOU TOGETHER IS...

15:44.533 --> 15:46.633
OH, TWOUIE...

15:49.433 --> 15:51.333
THIS IS
A FAMILY MEETING, SO...

15:51.367 --> 15:55.233
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER YOU BELONG HERE OR NOT.

15:55.267 --> 15:58.367
- LET HIM STAY.
HE'S KINDA GROWING ON ME.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.300
- WE THINK YOU KIDS
LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

16:04.333 --> 16:07.367
SO YOU ARE FREE TO PLAY
WITH EACH OTHER AGAIN.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.333
- YAY!

16:10.767 --> 16:13.467
- WELL, IF FRANKIE'S READY
TO APOLOGIZE,

16:13.500 --> 16:15.733
I'M WILLING TO LISTEN.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.700
- I HAVE NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

16:21.767 --> 16:24.633
- HERE'S A TENSION-BREAKER:

16:24.667 --> 16:27.700
THE REMARKABLE MATING CALL
OF THE BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY!

16:31.633 --> 16:33.467
OOH-AH, OOH-AH!

16:33.500 --> 16:35.767
OOH-AH, OOH-AHHHHH!

16:39.400 --> 16:41.067
- WE NEED TO REMIND THEM
WHY THEY LIKE EACH OTHER.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.200
I THINK I HAVE A PLAN.

16:45.233 --> 16:49.600
*

16:49.633 --> 16:52.067
- WE GOTTA MAKE THIS
HAPPEN NOW.

16:53.167 --> 16:58.467
*

17:00.200 --> 17:02.667
- I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR A-GAME, TAYLOR.

17:02.700 --> 17:05.733
I'M PLANNING A DISMOUNT
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE--

17:05.767 --> 17:07.467
THREE FLIPS IN A ROW.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.767
I CALL IT...
"THE QUADRUPLE EMMA."

17:12.167 --> 17:14.233
- THAT DOES SOUND AWESOME,

17:14.267 --> 17:17.333
IF NOT SLIGHTLY INCORRECT.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.633
LISTEN, EMMA,
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,

17:19.667 --> 17:22.167
BUT LATELY IT SEEMS
YOUR GYMNASTICS SKILLS

17:22.200 --> 17:23.667
HAVE GIVEN YOU A BIG HEAD.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.267
- IF THAT WERE TRUE,
WHY DOES MY VIKING HORN HAT

17:26.300 --> 17:27.500
STILL FIT?

17:29.667 --> 17:33.367
DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT,
DO YA?!

17:33.400 --> 17:35.400
NOW, LET'S SETTLE THIS.

17:38.367 --> 17:40.133
- TAYLOR!

17:40.167 --> 17:42.367
- MILES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:42.400 --> 17:44.067
- DON'T WORRY,
YOU'RE GOING TO BEAT HER

17:44.067 --> 17:45.533
AND STAY CAPTAIN.

17:45.567 --> 17:48.200
- I DON'T KNOW.
EMMA'S GOTTEN PRETTY GOOD.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.600
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT.

17:50.633 --> 17:53.400
HER FLIPS ARE ALMOST...
SUPERNATURAL.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.533
MILES...

18:00.700 --> 18:02.800
- I'M SORRY, WHAT WERE
WE TALKING ABOUT?

18:02.833 --> 18:05.567
- MILES, YOU TOTALLY
POSSESSED EMMA!

18:05.600 --> 18:07.267
- I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO MOVE AWAY.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.700
I SAW THAT LETTER
IN YOUR BACKPACK

18:08.733 --> 18:10.200
FROM THAT BOARDING SCHOOL.

18:10.233 --> 18:12.367
- I GET THOSE RECRUITING
LETTERS ALL THE TIME.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.467
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.367
- OH...WHOO!

18:16.400 --> 18:19.367
THANK GOODNESS!

18:19.400 --> 18:22.367
BUT WAIT--I SAW YOU HIDING
SOMETHING IN YOUR BACKPACK.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.967
IF IT WASN'T A LETTER,
THEN WHAT WAS IT?

18:25.067 --> 18:26.200
- THIS.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.067
IT'S A PRESENT.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.200
A LIGHT

18:35.067 --> 18:37.533
WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THIS?

18:37.567 --> 18:41.067
- IT WAS FOR NOT SNOOPING INTO
MY BUSINESS LATELY.

18:41.067 --> 18:43.467
- OH...

18:43.500 --> 18:45.667
- TRY TO MATCH THIS MOVE,
TAYLOR!

18:45.700 --> 18:47.700
- EMMA!
SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO DO

18:47.733 --> 18:50.500
THE SUPERNATURAL FLIP...
WITHOUT THE SUPERNATURAL!

18:50.533 --> 18:53.333
- GYMNASTICS CAPTAIN-HOOD,
HERE I COME!

19:01.833 --> 19:05.100
- EMMA!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:05.133 --> 19:06.767
HOW MANY FINGERS?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.067
- SEVEN.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.433
- OKAY, SHE'S FINE.

19:14.533 --> 19:16.800
- IF THIS DOESN'T GET FRANKIE
AND LOUIE BACK TOGETHER,

19:16.833 --> 19:18.700
NOTHING WILL.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.267
OOH! HERE HE COMES.
GET LOUIE.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.233
- YES!

19:26.267 --> 19:28.067
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.733
SAY, UH, YOU'VE BEEN DELIVERING
THINGS HERE FOR MONTHS,

19:32.767 --> 19:34.700
AND WE'VE NEVER REALLY
SAID HELLO.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.600
I'M MICHELLE HATHAWAY.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.567
- AND I'M MARRIED.
VERY SUBTLE.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.100
- NO...I'M NOT...

19:41.133 --> 19:43.567
I WASN'T, UM
LOOK...

19:45.233 --> 19:46.467
WHY DON'T YOU
SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE

19:46.500 --> 19:47.800
AND ENJOY SOME FREE MUFFINS?

19:47.833 --> 19:50.567
MY WAY OF SAYING
THANK YOU FOR...

19:50.600 --> 19:53.300
A JOB...DONE.

19:58.833 --> 20:00.167
- YOU WANTED ME
TO HELP CLOSE UP?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.367
- MM-HMM.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.467
- DAD SAID
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.033
- WELL, I NEED TO GET
A SCREWDRIVER TO FIX THAT SHELF

20:09.067 --> 20:12.600
BEFORE SOMEONE JIGGLES IT
AND SENDS ALL THOSE MESSY PIES

20:12.633 --> 20:15.733
CRASHING DOWN ON THAT
UNSUSPECTING DELIVERY MAN.

20:15.767 --> 20:18.467
I NEED YOU TWO TO MAKE
SURE NOTHING HAPPENS.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.533
BYE!

20:21.000 --> 20:23.667
- HEY, IT'S THAT
MEAN DELIVERY GUY.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.967
- SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.533
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU EITHER.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.633
- THAT'S GONNA
KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.967
- HEY, LADY,
WHERE'S MY MUFFIN?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.633
- A LOTTA PIES ABOVE THAT GUY.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.467
- LOTTA PIES.

20:44.233 --> 20:45.600
- YOU KEEP HIM

20:45.633 --> 20:48.100
IN THE TARGET ZONE?

20:52.533 --> 20:54.467
- WHAT--THE--

20:54.500 --> 20:55.633
HEY!

20:58.100 --> 21:01.067
- I'M SO SORRY!
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.667
MOVE OVER HERE.

21:09.667 --> 21:11.367
I'M OUTTA HERE!

21:14.500 --> 21:16.433
- TARGET DESTROYED!

21:16.467 --> 21:18.467
IT'S GOOD TO BE
WORKING WITH YOU AGAIN,

21:18.500 --> 21:20.200
AGENT FRANKIE.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.767
- YOU TOO.
NINER-NINER.

21:26.233 --> 21:29.967
- YOU KNOW, WE REALLY
ARE GOOD PARENTS.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.767
- HORRIBLE PEOPLE,
BUT GOOD PARENTS.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.533
ANOTHER PRANK.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.600
WE NEED SUPER GLUE AND
A 50-POUND BAG OF GUMMY WORMS.

21:43.633 --> 21:46.400
Michelle's voice:
AWWW, IT WARMS MY HEART

21:46.433 --> 21:50.067
TO SEE YOU TWO SCAMPS
PLAYING TOGETHER AGAIN.

21:50.067 --> 21:52.500
- MICHELLE, YOU LOOK
A LITTLE DIFFERENT TODAY.

21:52.533 --> 21:54.633
NEW HAIRSTYLE?

21:54.667 --> 21:57.633
- YES!
THANK YOU FOR NOTICING.

22:00.267 --> 22:03.700
Ray's voice:
I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.
