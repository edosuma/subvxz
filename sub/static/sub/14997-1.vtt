01:54.314 --> 01:56.115
Hi.
Morning.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.083
Come on.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.085
What'd you do to yourself?
Hey.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.287
This? This is nothing.

02:02.289 --> 02:06.825
Guy back in September,
he got tangled up in the bailer,
took his whole arm off.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.561
- Cool.
- No, it's not.

02:09.562 --> 02:12.531
The cast comes off next week.
It'll be good as new.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.233
Oh.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.502
Oh, hey, you trying
to break the other one?

02:16.504 --> 02:19.805
Uh, Ted says a firm handshake
shows strong character.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.841
Oh, so that's been my problem
all this time.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.911
How's this?
How's this, huh?
Oh!

02:27.648 --> 02:29.681
Hey!
Stop it.

02:29.683 --> 02:33.452
Love what you've done with the place.
Yeah.

02:34.787 --> 02:38.957
Feng shui and the motifs
over there and everything.

02:38.959 --> 02:42.928
Maybe you should be a decorator.
You have some spare time now.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.997
You know, Elliot,
if you're interested,

02:44.999 --> 02:48.400
I could talk to my guys
down at the warehouse,
see if they could use a hand.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.337
I'm good. Thanks, Ted.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.040
Okay, come say good-bye.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.143
You ever go-- you ever go
on any kind of cruise?

02:58.145 --> 03:02.047
It's not my thing.
I don't want to be
stuck on a boat

03:02.049 --> 03:04.183
with 2,000 rich assholes
for a week.

03:04.185 --> 03:07.219
And that norovirus thing
going around?
What's that?

03:07.221 --> 03:08.720
It's killer diarrhea.

03:08.722 --> 03:12.224
It's just a stomach bug
that we are not gonna get

03:12.226 --> 03:14.526
'cause, you know,
we wash our hands.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.662
All right, eat a vegetable
at some point.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.231
Have a good one, big guy.
You too.
Yeah, see ya.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.868
Take care.
Nice to see you.
I'll just be a second.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.639
Hey. You sure
you're good with this?

03:27.641 --> 03:29.508
My mom called again
this morning,

03:29.510 --> 03:32.144
said she's more than happy
to come and help
if you need it.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.712
Jesus.

03:33.714 --> 03:38.617
Thanks for
the vote of confidence,
but I got this.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.185
All right.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.154
Love you.
Bye, mom.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.755
Love you, too.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.825
Hey, so how are things
with the two of you?

03:48.162 --> 03:50.596
Yeah, we're not doing this.

03:52.198 --> 03:56.835
I just don't get it.
I know you don't.
Have fun.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.876
All right.
Now the party can start.

04:04.878 --> 04:08.380
This place is a lot smaller
than your last place.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.215
So, where are we
gonna sleep?

04:10.217 --> 04:14.519
I figured you guys
could just take my bed,
and I'll crash on the couch.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.922
He snores.
At least I don't wet the bed.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.124
That was, like,
three years ago.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.360
You're gonna figure it out.

04:21.362 --> 04:25.631
What do you want to do today?
Anything, just not
bowling again.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.633
He just doesn't want to go
because he sucks.
Shut up, Caleb.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.636
I always beat him.
You have pancakes?

04:30.638 --> 04:33.505
We just ate.
Yeah, but he's
a growing boy.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.341
He needs to eat all the time.
Go get your stuff put away,

04:36.343 --> 04:40.912
and I'll see if I can get you
some pancakes, all right?

04:51.190 --> 04:53.225
Here.
Put this over there.

04:53.227 --> 04:56.395
No, keep your crap
on your side of the room.
Idiot.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.864
Well, don't throw things
at me then.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.903
What?

05:08.374 --> 05:10.676
Look at this.

05:12.879 --> 05:13.912
Holy...

05:16.849 --> 05:18.517
Give me that.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.055
What?

05:36.436 --> 05:38.804
It's loaded. Easy, easy.
Give me it!

05:50.717 --> 05:54.553
How do you, like,
put the bullets in it?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.955
What the fuck are you doing?

05:58.458 --> 05:59.925
Bradley--
no, I didn't. Shut up.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.760
You cannot play with this!

06:01.762 --> 06:03.428
Well, you shouldn't
have left it out then.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.831
I didn't.
It was under the bed!

06:18.211 --> 06:20.712
I'm sorry I yelled.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.783
You said "fuck."
Caleb.

06:32.792 --> 06:37.662
Either of you ever--
ever shot one of these before?

06:41.934 --> 06:45.570
I was about your age
when my dad taught me.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.907
What if I took you boys out?

06:51.377 --> 06:55.514
Really?
Every man should know how
to safely use and respect a gun.

06:56.983 --> 07:00.452
Mom would freak out.
No, she won't.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.121
'Cause she'll never know.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.459
Right?
Yeah.

07:07.461 --> 07:11.430
Yeah, we could go up north
to our old logging site.

07:11.432 --> 07:16.067
Get some fresh air,
make men out of you boys.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.970
Ted sure as hell
ain't going to.
Yeah.

07:18.972 --> 07:22.240
Is that something
you'd be into?
Yeah. Say yes.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.010
Come on.
Huh?

07:25.012 --> 07:26.678
Uh, yeah. Sure.

07:26.680 --> 07:31.249
All right.
Okay, grab your coats.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.885
Yeah! Yes!

07:34.921 --> 07:36.621
Come on.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.592
Come on.

07:46.098 --> 07:49.835
There's some pop-tarts
in the glove box
if you guys are hungry.

07:51.003 --> 07:53.905
Do you know how much sugar
is in those things?

07:53.907 --> 07:57.976
Yep. That's what makes them
so damn delicious.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.217
Did your hand get stuck
in the machine, too?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.553
Nope.

08:08.555 --> 08:12.257
It got stuck
in my boss's face.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.398
Don't go telling your mom,
but yeah.

08:20.400 --> 08:24.970
He thought he could
just get away
with firing everybody

08:24.972 --> 08:27.939
and replacing us
with these damn robots.
Right.

08:27.941 --> 08:31.009
So destroying the forest
faster than ever.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.980
That's kinda the point.

08:36.982 --> 08:40.485
So you're not worried
about killing the environment?

08:40.486 --> 08:43.188
"Killing the environment"?

08:43.190 --> 08:46.658
What, are you gonna stop
using toilet paper?

08:46.660 --> 08:49.060
Are you going to stop breathing?

08:50.463 --> 08:54.466
The point is, you gotta
stand up for what's right.

08:54.468 --> 08:57.435
You can't just let people
push you around, you know?

08:57.437 --> 09:01.072
That-that's the way
the world really works.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.077
Hey, mom.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.548
No, yeah, we're just, uh,
learning how the world works.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.083
We're going for pancakes.
Yeah.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.486
Don't worry.
Yeah, we will. Okay.

09:14.488 --> 09:17.889
Okay, I love you, too. Bye.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.169
Ahh.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.172
Hey.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.975
All right,
grab some snacks

09:36.977 --> 09:39.844
and, uh, whatever
you want to drink.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.680
Here.
These are for me.
Uh-huh.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.316
And I'm gonna
fill up the truck.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.054
Here.
Oh, no, that's cool.

09:49.056 --> 09:52.891
Ted gave us a card
for emergencies and stuff.

09:52.893 --> 09:56.761
Well, this is not
an emergency.
Take it.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.603
Here.

11:11.605 --> 11:15.607
How-- how much was it?
Sixty-something.

11:15.609 --> 11:18.576
Sixty?
What'd you guys get?

11:18.578 --> 11:21.112
You know, snacks and stuff.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.086
Shit. Where's my phone?
Your precious phone is safe.

11:30.289 --> 11:32.724
You can't just take it.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.926
I want to spend some time
with you.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.698
I don't want your phone
to get all the attention.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.935
You'll get it back
when we get home, okay?

11:51.644 --> 11:53.645
We close?

11:53.647 --> 11:56.314
Mm, not quite.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.098
Here we go.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.788
What?

12:40.459 --> 12:42.894
We came all this way.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.310
What are you doing?

13:01.681 --> 13:03.882
Do it.

13:03.884 --> 13:07.786
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
My hands are tied here.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.021
Everybody knows
you can't refuse
the "do it, do it" chant.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.625
Go! Go!

13:13.627 --> 13:16.661
Stop, dad!
You can do it, dad.
You can do it.

13:18.098 --> 13:21.466
That was awesome!
That was crazy.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.603
Shit.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.806
Did that cop see us?
What?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.410
You're such a dick.
You totally went for it.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.479
I'd give you up.
I'd give you up in a heartbeat.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.714
"I'm sorry, officer.
I was just tryin'
to get to church.

13:36.716 --> 13:40.785
This little one right here
was doing the 'do it,
do it, do it' chant."

13:57.536 --> 13:59.304
Wow.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.409
Welcome to my office.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.211
Cool.

14:15.454 --> 14:18.056
Man, I love it out here.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.926
I wish I could just move up here
and live off the land.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.495
Yeah.
Let's do it, huh?

14:24.497 --> 14:27.398
- No more responsibilities, no school.
- I like school.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.869
Come on,
nobody likes school.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.404
All right, have a seat.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.808
What's the first rule
of gun safety?
No drinking?

14:36.810 --> 14:39.477
Don't shoot anybody?
Smart-asses.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.046
Yeah, that is absolutely
the first rule:
Don't shoot anyone.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.749
So, always keep the gun
pointed downrange,

14:44.751 --> 14:47.719
and you keep the safety on
until you're ready to fire,
okay?

14:47.721 --> 14:50.288
And that's this
little button right here.
See the red?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.457
That means the safety's off,
and it's ready to fire.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.026
So red, you're dead.
"Red, you're dead." Cool.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.229
Okay.
Ready to give it a shot?
Yeah.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.032
Oldest first.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.668
Thanks.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.038
Pull the lever there.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.141
Yeah, and drop it in.
Okay.

15:10.143 --> 15:13.244
Make sure it's seated.
There you go. Snap it shut.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.113
Okay.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.851
Just shoot it anywhere?

15:19.853 --> 15:23.288
You gotta keep it snug.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.427
I thought you shot yourself!

15:29.429 --> 15:30.695
Oh, my god!

15:30.697 --> 15:33.531
I told you
to keep it snug.

15:33.533 --> 15:38.269
All right, well, now we know
that this isn't a toy, right?

15:40.005 --> 15:41.639
Where you going?

15:44.143 --> 15:46.311
You just gonna go off
and cry about it?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.713
Guess it's my turn.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.114
Hey, have a damn
sense of humor.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.051
Can you just give me
a minute, please?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.462
Hey, what's the matter
with you?
It was him.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.165
This little guy right--
ooh-hoo-hoo!

16:10.270 --> 16:13.171
Ohh!
You blame me for everything!

16:13.173 --> 16:15.473
You're ganging up on me
with your cheap shots?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.475
Okay,
that's how you wanna play?
Hey! No!

16:17.477 --> 16:19.877
That's how you wanna play?
Wait up! No!

16:19.879 --> 16:22.013
No, no, no, wait!

16:22.015 --> 16:24.315
I hit him!

16:24.317 --> 16:28.286
Winner! Winner!

16:28.288 --> 16:30.822
Winner!
Caleb, stop!

16:30.824 --> 16:34.359
He's soaked!

16:34.361 --> 16:38.062
- Not funny.
- Well, we're both laughing.

16:38.064 --> 16:41.366
We're just playing--
hey, come on.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.802
Come on, we were
just playing around.
Yeah, sorry.

16:44.804 --> 16:48.439
Hey.
Brad.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.708
Want my coat?

16:50.710 --> 16:53.111
He'll be fine.
Come on.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.172
All right!
Brad, I hit it!

17:23.342 --> 17:25.209
Bradley!

17:26.545 --> 17:28.413
Come on out here!

17:42.327 --> 17:45.563
All right! Nice shot.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.765
Hey, can we go?
I gotta use the bathroom.

17:50.069 --> 17:55.073
Go write your name in the snow.
The whole world's your toilet.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.818
Want a sip?
Yeah.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.853
You sure?
Sure.

18:19.265 --> 18:23.201
You like it?

18:23.203 --> 18:25.670
It's not that bad.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.472
Huh?

18:28.740 --> 18:31.576
Dad let me have
a sip of his beer.
Great.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.645
You just gonna rat me out
like that?

18:36.648 --> 18:41.085
Hey. Just hit the target once,
and then we can go, all right?

18:41.087 --> 18:42.753
Okay.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.761
All right. Caleb,

18:50.763 --> 18:52.797
show him how it's done.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.802
Okay, so basically,
you wanna widen your stance,

18:57.804 --> 19:01.139
and just mash it into,
like, the squishy part
of your shoulder.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.640
Hey.
And you just line it--

19:02.642 --> 19:04.342
hey.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.643
Shh.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.678
Hey. Look.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.517
Shh.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.394
Caleb, don't--

19:24.496 --> 19:26.797
nice shot!

19:28.100 --> 19:30.101
Nice!

19:38.912 --> 19:42.914
Look at that.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.319
What, was I supposed
to just let him suffer?

19:51.423 --> 19:54.358
What did you think
was gonna happen?

19:54.360 --> 19:57.261
I didn't think I'd hit it.

20:00.499 --> 20:04.468
Jesus, you boys are soft.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.672
Fine, let's just--
let's just go. Let's go.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.473
You okay?

20:22.621 --> 20:25.189
You've been drinking.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.825
So?

20:41.607 --> 20:43.307
You drive.

20:45.344 --> 20:49.447
He doesn't have a license.
He's gotta learn sometime.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.818
All right.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.630
So Ted never taught you?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.932
Like Ted would ever
let him drive the car.

21:07.934 --> 21:12.436
You just go slow
and keep it steady.
You got this.

21:13.740 --> 21:17.375
Okay. And this...
Release the hand brake.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.810
Okay.
Slowly pull out.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.579
Whoa.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.081
There you go.
Okay.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.285
Now you're driving.
Okay.

21:39.698 --> 21:41.399
You're doing good.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.268
If you need
to step on the brake,
just press slowly on the brake.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.305
Don't step on it
'cause it's ice.
It'll just skid.
Okay.

21:50.742 --> 21:53.811
You're doing good.
Thanks.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.781
You all right?
Yeah, yeah.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.783
Sure you don't want me
to take over?

21:58.785 --> 22:01.719
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.057
He drives like a grandmother.
Let me try.

22:06.059 --> 22:08.426
You couldn't see
over the steering wheel.

22:08.428 --> 22:12.663
Hey, cut it out!
Stop it.
Hey, cut it out.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.535
Just quit it!
Quit playin' around!

22:26.346 --> 22:28.779
Holy shit!
Are you okay?
Yeah.

22:28.781 --> 22:32.983
Sorry, I didn't-- I just--
i don't know...

22:33.985 --> 22:35.986
Oh, f--

22:37.055 --> 22:38.622
fuck!

22:40.659 --> 22:43.527
Fucking told you
not to play around!

22:45.831 --> 22:48.566
Shit.
Dad?

22:51.269 --> 22:54.271
All right.
All right, turn the ignition on.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.973
Put it in reverse.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.678
Okay. Give it some gas!

23:00.680 --> 23:04.215
Give it some gas. More!

23:04.217 --> 23:06.450
A little more!

23:19.998 --> 23:21.665
It's fine.

23:22.868 --> 23:26.070
It's fine.
Are we stuck out here?

23:27.572 --> 23:29.774
What's the knife for?

23:31.109 --> 23:33.144
Now, you come with me, Caleb.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.017
Oh, shit!

23:40.019 --> 23:43.621
Okay. Awesome. Oh.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.064
Okay.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.803
Oh, fuck. Come on!

23:58.805 --> 24:02.740
Really jam it in there.
There you go.
Like that?

24:04.342 --> 24:08.579
Okay. Back up. All right,
Brad, give it some gas.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.833
We clear?

24:34.006 --> 24:36.006
Okay, okay.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.703
It's not great,

25:05.705 --> 25:08.706
but it'll help
keep the cold out.

25:08.708 --> 25:14.245
We can turn the car
on now and then, but we can't
keep it running all night.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.922
How come you left mom?
Caleb.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.161
Mm, mm...

25:31.163 --> 25:32.997
What'd she say?

25:34.733 --> 25:37.735
That you left because
we were more mature than you.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.841
Yeah, well... I mean...

25:45.043 --> 25:47.211
She's not wrong.

25:53.051 --> 25:58.889
You know, back then, i--
i didn't want to have kids.

25:58.891 --> 26:03.561
I mean, I hadn't really
thought about it, you know?

26:03.563 --> 26:06.730
I wasn't more than
a couple years older
than you guys.

26:08.134 --> 26:12.036
And then, you know,
mom got pregnant,

26:12.038 --> 26:15.172
and she didn't want to,
you know--

26:15.174 --> 26:16.874
she wanted to keep it.

26:19.377 --> 26:24.815
But now, it's so different.

26:24.817 --> 26:30.154
I mean, I know to you guys,
it's just, you know,

26:30.156 --> 26:33.057
being away from your friends
and video games and shit.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.858
But to me...

26:36.294 --> 26:39.163
It's-- it's the best thing
in my life.

26:41.199 --> 26:44.835
I mean, you guys
are the best thing in my life.

26:44.837 --> 26:49.373
It's pretty much the only thing
i haven't screwed up yet.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.209
That's why, you know,

26:52.211 --> 26:57.748
this little adventure
that we're out on...

26:59.317 --> 27:02.319
Your mom and Ted,
they can't find out about this.

27:04.289 --> 27:08.092
You know? I don't think

27:08.094 --> 27:11.528
they'd let us
hang out anymore.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.330
You know, i-i just--

27:13.332 --> 27:15.733
you know, I just can't
let that happen.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.578
What?

27:27.580 --> 27:29.780
What's going on?

27:32.150 --> 27:36.887
Mom, um-- mom was gonna
tell you when we got back.

27:36.889 --> 27:40.524
Caleb, you're not supposed
to say anything.

27:40.526 --> 27:44.261
What do you mean,
said not to tell?

27:44.263 --> 27:45.396
Tell what?

27:47.666 --> 27:52.970
Ted got a promotion,
and we're moving.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.310
Where?

28:03.181 --> 28:04.915
London.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.455
London?

28:15.127 --> 28:16.927
I mean, what?

28:16.929 --> 28:19.630
That's-- that's crazy.

28:19.632 --> 28:21.665
What...

28:21.667 --> 28:24.868
London. Y-you're...

28:26.371 --> 28:29.873
You're--
you're moving to London?
We don't want to go.

28:29.875 --> 28:33.310
Of course not.
Yeah, all our friends
are here and stuff.

28:33.312 --> 28:38.348
No. You're not--
you're not moving to London.

28:38.350 --> 28:43.654
I-I'll talk to your mom.
You're-- you're not
moving anywhere.

28:43.656 --> 28:45.856
We leave
at the end of the month.

28:52.797 --> 28:56.700
Wh-- what, you're just...

28:56.702 --> 28:59.837
They can't do that.
That's...

28:59.839 --> 29:03.841
What, they're just gonna--
just gonna drag you away
halfway across the world?

29:03.843 --> 29:08.145
What-- and I never
get to see you again?

29:08.147 --> 29:11.582
That's insane!
I mean, you're my kids!
You're my kids!

29:11.584 --> 29:14.618
Ted said he would help you
buy a ticket, though,
if you want to come visit.

29:14.620 --> 29:17.354
Oh, fucking Ted's
gonna help me.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.061
It's okay, dad.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.766
No!
Dad!

29:28.768 --> 29:30.400
No!

29:30.402 --> 29:32.369
No, no!
Dad!

29:32.371 --> 29:34.371
Aah! No!
Dad, no...

29:34.373 --> 29:38.008
Aah! Aah!
It's-- it's okay.
It's okay.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.210
Fuck! No, no!
Dad, stop.
What are you doing, dad?

29:40.212 --> 29:42.312
Aah! No!
Dad!

29:42.314 --> 29:44.314
Aah!

29:44.316 --> 29:46.717
Dad!

29:46.719 --> 29:49.386
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, stop it! Please!

29:49.388 --> 29:50.821
Aah!

29:53.058 --> 29:56.960
Dad, don't...

30:01.599 --> 30:04.134
Da--

30:09.641 --> 30:11.441
dad?

30:19.818 --> 30:22.119
Dad, what are you...

30:29.127 --> 30:30.894
Dad?

30:35.333 --> 30:37.034
Hey...

30:38.369 --> 30:40.003
Hey...

30:47.846 --> 30:50.247
I'm fine.

30:53.718 --> 30:55.853
I'm fine.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.564
We're the only ones
out here.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.469
More than 30 miles.

31:19.744 --> 31:21.945
Just listen.

31:27.352 --> 31:32.222
All the sound
just gets swallowed up.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.227
It's incredible.

31:39.797 --> 31:42.332
I feel like we're on the moon.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.646
Dad, you okay?

32:04.622 --> 32:06.456
No.

32:11.429 --> 32:14.298
Everything's gonna be all right.

32:17.001 --> 32:19.336
Look what I found.

32:21.973 --> 32:24.241
Put it on.

32:25.543 --> 32:28.145
Here's a blanket.
Thank you.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.414
Okay, let's try
to get some sleep.

32:30.416 --> 32:33.050
We got an early morning
tomorrow.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.549
Stop snoring.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.551
You stop moving.

33:11.189 --> 33:13.223
What are you doing?

33:15.793 --> 33:18.595
Brad.
Will you quit it?

33:18.597 --> 33:20.263
What?

33:21.299 --> 33:23.200
What?

33:23.202 --> 33:25.202
Where did he go, Brad?

33:25.204 --> 33:28.805
I'm so cold.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.310
Oh, shit, come on, please.

33:33.312 --> 33:37.080
Come on.

33:37.082 --> 33:39.249
What's wrong?
It's not turning on.

33:39.251 --> 33:42.085
He just went
to get help, right?

33:42.087 --> 33:44.254
I don't know. Maybe.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.761
Oh, funny.
Who'd you think it was?

33:50.763 --> 33:53.730
Bradley thought
you were big foot.
Where have you been?

33:53.732 --> 33:56.967
I went for a hike
to scout things out.
Did you find help?

33:56.969 --> 34:02.039
No, but a couple years ago,
we were set up on
the other side of this valley.

34:02.041 --> 34:05.442
And we went hunting one weekend,
and there's a cabin down there.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.677
I think that's our best bet.
So grab all the stuff.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.545
How is that our best bet?
We've gotta go back

34:09.547 --> 34:11.915
to the highway and try
and find help from there.

34:11.917 --> 34:14.284
No, no. Hey, grab
the stuff out there.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.620
Now, we're too far
from the road.

34:16.621 --> 34:20.123
We can't be out in the cold
for that long, and this truck
isn't gonna keep us warm.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.125
What about food?
I'm starving.

34:22.127 --> 34:23.927
Yeah, we'll find
something there.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.496
Just grab what you can carry.
Essentials only.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.598
We gotta keep it light.
Gonna be slow going
in the snow.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.234
Yeah, but how are we gonna
find this place?

34:31.235 --> 34:33.770
Where's your sense
of adventure?

34:35.174 --> 34:37.274
Let's go.

34:37.275 --> 34:40.210
This is bullshit.

34:55.059 --> 34:56.626
What?

34:59.797 --> 35:02.833
This way.
How do you know?

35:04.569 --> 35:08.805
See these branches?
They're bigger on this side.

35:08.807 --> 35:12.309
They get more sun.
Less stress from the north wind.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.578
It means they point south.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.547
Come on.

35:33.731 --> 35:35.465
How much further is it?

35:37.602 --> 35:38.802
Dad?

35:40.705 --> 35:44.908
Hey, should we really keep going
if we're not sure
where we're headed?

35:44.910 --> 35:46.710
You got a better idea?

35:50.681 --> 35:54.684
This is the right way.
I know I'm right.

35:54.686 --> 35:55.886
Come on.

36:14.539 --> 36:16.606
Come on.

36:16.608 --> 36:20.343
Keep an eye out for the cabin.
We should be getting close.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.652
I know it's here somewhere.
Come on.

37:15.334 --> 37:18.134
Hey, wait, wait--
wait a minute.

37:18.136 --> 37:19.669
What?
Shut up.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.312
What?

37:34.352 --> 37:36.553
Can you not hear that?

37:38.155 --> 37:40.457
Well, what was it?

37:40.459 --> 37:43.560
I just-- shouldn't we go
and check it out?

37:46.832 --> 37:48.798
It's gone.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.435
Come on.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.005
We should go
and find them, no?

37:55.007 --> 37:57.007
Come on.

38:12.224 --> 38:14.924
I know.
Try not to think about it.

38:20.331 --> 38:23.366
Look!

38:23.368 --> 38:26.569
Finally! Yes!

38:26.571 --> 38:29.406
Told ya!

38:47.024 --> 38:48.925
Brad!

38:50.761 --> 38:53.396
Dad!

38:57.669 --> 38:58.802
Bradley!

38:58.804 --> 39:01.104
Dad, get me out!
Caleb, stay back!

39:01.106 --> 39:03.273
Get off the ice, now!

39:10.081 --> 39:12.982
Hello! Hello!

39:22.928 --> 39:24.094
Dad...

39:24.096 --> 39:26.529
Come on.

39:35.940 --> 39:39.909
I got you guys some blankets.
You gotta--
you gotta make a fire!

39:40.878 --> 39:43.380
Get them off!

39:47.619 --> 39:50.153
Here, here...

39:55.292 --> 39:58.261
I can't...
See if you can find
some matches.

39:58.263 --> 39:59.763
Come on, Caleb, hurry up!

40:02.401 --> 40:05.368
I'm so cold.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.637
Look over there.
Hurry up!

40:07.639 --> 40:09.706
Matches, matches...

40:09.708 --> 40:12.876
Get your hands up.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.078
Oh, here!

40:17.415 --> 40:19.783
Here they go.

40:24.555 --> 40:26.356
It's working.

40:26.358 --> 40:28.091
It's working, it's working!

41:02.092 --> 41:03.326
I got...

41:21.545 --> 41:24.080
Why would anybody want
to live all the way out here?

41:25.916 --> 41:28.685
Um...

41:28.687 --> 41:31.688
Well, people
mostly use it

41:31.690 --> 41:35.191
for hunting
or ice fishing or something,

41:35.193 --> 41:38.528
and you can leave it
in the same shape you found it.

41:40.332 --> 41:43.766
We'll have to chop up
some more wood before we leave.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.571
When will that be?

41:55.412 --> 41:58.114
I don't know.

42:10.127 --> 42:11.995
I fucked up.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.301
I fucked up.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.841
It's okay.

42:25.776 --> 42:27.977
We're having fun.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.655
I thought I was gonna lose you.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.660
I thought I was gonna lose you.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.906
Dad, it's okay.

42:59.810 --> 43:01.311
Dad...

43:33.911 --> 43:35.244
Dad?

43:52.429 --> 43:54.364
Uh...

43:56.600 --> 44:00.637
J-just come back to the fire.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.009
You don't have...

44:14.218 --> 44:19.756
It's okay. I just--
i just need to sleep.

44:27.297 --> 44:29.799
I can't lose you guys.

44:32.770 --> 44:35.972
I just can't.

44:49.888 --> 44:52.755
Was this your card?
No.

44:52.757 --> 44:55.158
Yeah, it was.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.160
Okay, one second.

44:58.796 --> 45:01.564
How about this one?
Was it that one?

45:01.566 --> 45:04.801
What?

45:06.870 --> 45:10.006
What is that?
I don't know.

45:10.008 --> 45:11.474
Brad?

45:12.643 --> 45:15.745
Wh-what is it?

45:18.717 --> 45:20.583
Dad!
Dad.

45:20.585 --> 45:23.486
Dad!

45:23.488 --> 45:26.355
Dad!

45:26.357 --> 45:27.423
What?
Dad!

45:27.425 --> 45:29.459
Hey!
Jesus Christ!

45:29.461 --> 45:30.860
Whoa!

45:30.862 --> 45:32.695
Who the fuck--
who the fuck are you?

45:32.697 --> 45:37.033
Look, does he know
what he's doing?

45:39.536 --> 45:42.171
Yeah, you're fine.
Dad...

45:42.173 --> 45:45.842
Whoa!
What the fuck
you doing here?

45:45.844 --> 45:48.010
Hey, hey...

45:48.012 --> 45:50.279
Hey, you talk English.
What the hell you doing here?

45:50.281 --> 45:53.750
Look, we've been
out here hunting
for three days, all right?

45:53.752 --> 45:57.420
We tried to leave earlier,
but we couldn't get
the truck out.

46:00.858 --> 46:03.025
Hey, Brad, get their guns.

46:03.894 --> 46:06.896
Brad, get their guns now!

46:06.898 --> 46:09.132
Put them in the back room.

46:11.368 --> 46:14.370
It's okay.
It's okay. Just...

46:17.776 --> 46:21.144
So where's your truck?

46:22.713 --> 46:27.049
On the access road,
just around the cabin,
down that trail.

46:27.051 --> 46:29.819
I don't--
look, I'm Richard.

46:29.821 --> 46:33.356
Okay? This is Luke.

46:36.461 --> 46:40.530
Stop talking French, okay?

46:41.965 --> 46:45.268
Hey!<i> Parlez anglais,</i>
<i> s'il vous plaît.</i>

46:47.437 --> 46:51.741
He's-- he just said
we were here first, okay?

46:51.743 --> 46:54.010
We can share.

46:54.945 --> 46:57.280
It'll be all right.

46:57.282 --> 46:59.415
Listen to your son, okay?

46:59.417 --> 47:02.318
It's not even
your fucking cabin, man.

47:02.320 --> 47:06.322
We can't just leave them
out there. It's freezing.

47:32.783 --> 47:35.484
What are you boys
doing up here, anyway?

47:36.887 --> 47:39.889
He was teaching us to shoot.
Yeah?

47:42.227 --> 47:44.427
Are you okay?

47:44.429 --> 47:46.262
He fell through the ice.
It was crazy.

47:46.264 --> 47:49.365
No shit. Have some of this.
Soothe your throat.

47:49.367 --> 47:52.869
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

47:52.871 --> 47:55.171
They're kids.

47:55.173 --> 47:59.375
Hey, man, relax.
I'm just tryin' to help.

47:59.377 --> 48:02.311
You go over there
in the corner and relax.

48:04.948 --> 48:07.149
You boys go in the back room
and get some sleep.

48:08.252 --> 48:11.520
We're not tired.
Now.

48:45.822 --> 48:48.291
Man, we just--
you want some of this?

49:05.710 --> 49:07.710
You all right?

49:09.212 --> 49:13.149
When are we leaving?
I don't know.

49:14.051 --> 49:17.486
I'm starving.

49:24.294 --> 49:25.194
Here.

49:27.465 --> 49:30.533
Here. Just to be safe.

49:41.044 --> 49:43.045
What do you think they want?

49:43.047 --> 49:44.981
What do you mean?

49:44.983 --> 49:48.150
Come here. Tell me
what they're saying.

50:02.065 --> 50:04.767
Uh, they're talking
really fast.

50:06.303 --> 50:10.706
Something about their truck.
Maybe just getting their truck.

50:13.577 --> 50:16.412
Where'd you learn
how to speak French?

50:16.414 --> 50:20.016
School.
I hate French class.

50:25.956 --> 50:30.159
All right. Go lie down.

51:34.125 --> 51:36.258
Hey!

51:39.963 --> 51:41.764
Where's-- where's my dad?

51:41.766 --> 51:43.966
I don't know.
I got up, and he was gone.

51:43.968 --> 51:46.569
Well, where you going?

51:46.571 --> 51:49.905
I'm just gonna go see if i
can get this truck outta here.

51:49.907 --> 51:53.109
Can I come with you?
Ah, nah.

51:53.111 --> 51:55.611
Look, I think
you should stay here.
How's your brother?

51:55.613 --> 51:58.114
He's still--
he's still asleep.

51:58.116 --> 51:59.915
Good. Well, just keep
that fire going,

51:59.917 --> 52:03.519
and I'm sure your dad
will be back soon, okay?

52:14.431 --> 52:17.233
Breaker 1-9, come in.

52:18.301 --> 52:21.604
Breaker 1-9, anybody home?

52:25.208 --> 52:28.577
Breaker 1-9, anybody there?

52:28.579 --> 52:30.479
Hello?

52:34.718 --> 52:39.088
Anyone there?
Do you read me?
Do you copy?

52:39.090 --> 52:41.557
Do you copy?
Repeat back.

52:42.626 --> 52:44.527
Do you copy?

52:50.168 --> 52:51.600
Fuck.

53:13.390 --> 53:16.725
Holy shit!

53:16.727 --> 53:20.296
You scared
the hell outta me.

53:20.298 --> 53:22.865
What are you doing?

53:22.867 --> 53:26.402
Just tryin' to get
this thing outta here.

53:26.404 --> 53:28.604
You want to give me
a hand?

53:31.541 --> 53:33.742
Do you mind
giving it some gas?

53:45.356 --> 53:47.122
All right, go for it.

53:49.860 --> 53:52.761
Whoa, whoa! Easy!

53:52.763 --> 53:54.763
What are you doing?

53:56.933 --> 53:59.435
You all right, man?

53:59.437 --> 54:02.104
Look, why don't you
try pushing, huh?

54:02.106 --> 54:03.973
All right.

54:06.276 --> 54:11.013
Hey, man. Look, we're gonna
get your kids outta here.

54:11.015 --> 54:12.915
Okay? I promise.

54:12.917 --> 54:15.718
All right?
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just...

54:16.987 --> 54:18.887
Just give it a push.

54:22.627 --> 54:24.893
<i> Hello?</i>

54:24.895 --> 54:26.795
Hello? Hello. Can...

54:26.797 --> 54:28.797
Listen, can you hear me?
We're stranded out here.

54:28.799 --> 54:31.267
We got some kids here
that need help.

54:33.070 --> 54:35.471
We're on a logging road--
<i> what's your location?</i>

54:35.473 --> 54:38.040
About 50 miles...

54:47.717 --> 54:50.286
What the fuck?

54:50.288 --> 54:53.856
You're gonna--
you're gonna--

54:53.858 --> 54:57.660
you're gonna take them away.
What?

54:57.662 --> 55:01.630
Look, it...
Can, um...

55:03.500 --> 55:06.268
Luke!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

55:06.270 --> 55:08.704
Hey!
I don't wanna hurt you!

55:08.706 --> 55:11.206
Luke!
Shh!

55:11.208 --> 55:13.342
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
Stop. Stop.

55:13.344 --> 55:16.011
Luke! Luke!

55:16.013 --> 55:18.881
Ugh! What the fuck
is wrong with you?
Please stop. Please stop.

55:18.883 --> 55:23.319
Get off! What the fuck?
Get off me!

55:23.321 --> 55:26.155
Stop it! Stop it!

55:26.157 --> 55:28.590
Stop it!

55:28.592 --> 55:30.326
Aah!

55:30.328 --> 55:33.128
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

55:33.130 --> 55:35.698
I don't wanna hurt you!

55:42.839 --> 55:44.673
Help!
Stop!

56:00.824 --> 56:02.358
Hey.

56:03.393 --> 56:05.361
Hey.

56:07.130 --> 56:09.098
Hey, wake up!

56:11.101 --> 56:15.037
Wake up! Wake up!

56:36.593 --> 56:39.161
Look at that!

56:39.163 --> 56:41.830
Okay, put it in the pile.

56:53.977 --> 56:55.544
What?

56:57.580 --> 57:00.549
He should be back.

57:00.551 --> 57:05.687
Maybe I, uh--
i go check on him, okay?

57:05.689 --> 57:08.090
Well, should I come too?
No, no, no.

57:09.793 --> 57:11.960
Here.

57:14.230 --> 57:17.766
You wait here,
all right? Okay.

57:35.585 --> 57:37.820
Hey, man.
Hi.

57:38.655 --> 57:40.856
Where's everybody at?

57:42.625 --> 57:45.694
It's just us.

57:45.696 --> 57:48.163
Dad's been gone
all day.

58:01.177 --> 58:02.878
Where'd he go?

58:05.281 --> 58:07.483
I don't know.

58:08.485 --> 58:10.686
He's okay, right?

58:21.865 --> 58:24.032
Richard?

58:27.971 --> 58:30.105
Richard!

58:35.145 --> 58:36.912
Richard!

58:44.220 --> 58:46.221
No.

58:51.628 --> 58:53.495
Caleb, wait!

58:53.497 --> 58:56.265
Wait! Wait!

58:59.102 --> 59:02.237
Dad! Dad, where are you?

59:02.239 --> 59:05.073
Da--

59:06.943 --> 59:08.443
dad?

59:08.445 --> 59:11.680
Hey. Come here.
What happened?

59:11.682 --> 59:14.149
Caleb, come here.
Come here.

59:16.753 --> 59:18.987
Come on. Come here.

59:21.190 --> 59:23.825
Hey.

59:23.827 --> 59:25.661
This thing could feed us
for weeks.

59:25.663 --> 59:28.997
Here. Just hold that.
Hold that.

59:38.074 --> 59:39.641
Ugh!

59:51.087 --> 59:53.655
Ugh!

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:13.542
Richard, where is he?

01:00:13.544 --> 01:00:15.777
I don't know
what you're saying.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:19.181
He's not at the truck.
He should be back.

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:22.451
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, go back inside
of the house.

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:24.219
Is he at the cabin?

01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:26.555
Uh-uh.

01:00:26.557 --> 01:00:27.990
You do something to him?

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.426
My English,
you don't understand.

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:33.362
Go inside, everything's fine.

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:34.696
Just go back to the house.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:36.765
No, you're coming with me.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:38.033
Everybody come with me.

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:39.568
They're not gonna come with you.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:42.137
You're outta
your fucking mind!

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.811
What--

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:52.948
dad, you--

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:01.089
stop, dad!

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:03.025
Luke, run!
Dad, don't shoot!

01:01:03.027 --> 01:01:04.893
Get off. Get off!
Dad, stop!

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:20.442
Get back to the house.

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.645
Now!
Caleb, come on!

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:25.681
Come on, Caleb! Come!

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:36.358
Do you think he's okay?

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.703
Where's the other guy?

01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:49.337
What was he talking about?

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.787
I was trying to scare them off.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.460
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:16.264
I'm trying to keep you safe,
okay?
Okay.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.841
Just stay here.
They're still out there
somewhere.

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.431
Give me that bag.

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.005
We can't just leave him here.

01:02:57.007 --> 01:03:00.041
Look, he doesn't want to leave,
Caleb.

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:03.779
Shit.

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.216
Why are there two sets?
I don't know.

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:11.787
Come on, we just gotta go.

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:03.171
This doesn't look like
the way we came.

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.149
We shouldn't be here.

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.588
You're the one
that made us leave.

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:24.226
I mean we shouldn't have come
out here in the first place.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.362
You wanted to shoot the gun,
too.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:29.164
Yeah, I know, but...

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.399
If we had left when I said,
none of this would have
happened.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:33.969
You were just too busy trying
to be dad's best friend.

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:43.111
Oh, come-- I'm sorry, Caleb.
Please, look.

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:45.280
We gotta stick together
if we wanna get outta here,
okay?

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:46.715
You don't know
where you're going.

01:04:46.717 --> 01:04:48.450
Think somebody's just gonna
come save us?

01:04:48.452 --> 01:04:50.719
No, but you don't wanna get
any more lost.

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:52.254
We can't get any more lost.

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.535
You just left me.

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:12.941
We were gonna try
to find help.

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.945
We gotta stick together.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:18.446
You can't just leave me.

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:22.651
Yeah, well,
we were gonna come back
for you, dad.

01:05:22.653 --> 01:05:24.319
I promise.

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.466
Say something.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:45.206
Do you have any idea what
could happen to you out here?

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:48.109
Look, we're sorry.
Look, I'm your father!

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.878
It's my job to protect you.

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.986
You think that's funny?

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:02.691
You got something
you want to say to me?

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:22.010
You got something
you want to say to me?

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.312
Say it.

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:27.649
You think
I'm a shitty father?

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:30.352
Hm? Say it.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:35.690
Hm?

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:39.094
You think I'm a shitty dad?

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:45.033
Say it. Yeah?

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.471
Say it.

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:52.307
You're a shitty dad.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.510
There you go.

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.213
You gonna say it
like a little pussy,

01:06:58.215 --> 01:07:00.248
or are you gonna say
it like a man?

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:04.119
Huh?

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:05.320
Say it again.

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.891
Say it.

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:12.227
Say it! Say it!

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:14.362
There you go.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.232
There you go. There you go.
Fuck you.
Come on! Fucking...!

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:19.100
Say it.
No!

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:20.735
Say it!
No!

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:23.304
You think I'm
a shitty father?
No!

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:25.807
You think I'm a shitty father?
Say it! Say it!

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.442
Get off me!
Say it!

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:31.346
Huh? Say it.
I'm a shitty father.
Say it.

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:32.647
Get off me, please!
Say it!

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:33.715
Dad!
Say it!

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.517
You're a shitty father!
There you go!

01:07:35.519 --> 01:07:38.420
Let him go, please!
Get off me!

01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:42.490
Shh, shh, shh...

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:47.195
Shh...

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.808
Fuck off.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.555
Dad? Dad!

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.194
Dad!

01:08:56.698 --> 01:08:58.133
Stay back.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.349
Hey, we could smash out the
windows.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.317
It's too loud. He'd hear it.

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:26.861
We could...
We could build a bonfire.

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:29.063
Maybe a helicopter
will come find us.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:22.450
What... where's he going?

01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:55.550
Give me that thing.

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:12.867
There you go.

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:22.710
Try to get the other one.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.386
Come on.
Shh, shh.

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:35.390
Can you fit?

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.626
I don't know.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.029
Go on.

01:11:41.031 --> 01:11:43.931
Do you need a hand?
I don't think so.

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:53.408
Hey, can you see anything?
Is there a way out?

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.676
I don't know.

01:11:54.678 --> 01:11:56.644
Here.

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:00.315
Anything?

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:15.396
Oh, my god! Brad! Bradley!

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:17.298
What?

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.200
Caleb?

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:22.470
He's not...
Shh, shh.
Okay. What do you... what?

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:24.272
Okay, just...
He's not... he's not moving.

01:12:24.274 --> 01:12:28.242
I don't know what happened.
That other guy, he's...

01:12:28.244 --> 01:12:29.744
Brad, he's dead.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:34.382
Listen, you can't wait.

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:37.151
I'll figure something out
and come find you.
You gotta go.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.028
What's going on in there?

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.165
Nothing. We're fine.

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:55.536
You feeling okay?
Better, thanks. We're okay.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:13:00.641
I'm chopping a bunch of wood
so it's gonna be warm in here
in a couple minutes.

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:04.412
Say something, say something!
Great, thank you.

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:18.860
Okay, okay. The keys.
Here, take these.

01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:22.096
Find their truck
and go get help, okay?

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:25.299
I--
shh-shh,
come on, come on.

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:27.402
Hey, look, I know you don't
wanna go on your own,

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:28.503
but you have to, okay?

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:30.004
You don't have a choice.
Okay?

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:32.640
You gotta go.
You gotta get help, okay?

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:34.976
It can't be far.

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:36.811
Go!
Okay.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.047
Now!
Okay, okay.

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:13.181
Caleb?
He's sleeping.

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:17.318
Is he mad at me?
No.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.620
He's just tired.
He's fine.

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:24.492
I'm trying to keep
you safe.
Yeah.

01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:26.727
Yeah, we're... yeah.
Of course.

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:30.298
As long as we stay here
together, we'll be okay.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:33.201
Sure.
You gotta trust me.

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:10.998
Alone?
Where's your father?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.367
He has Bradley
back at the cabin.

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:16.103
You need to get us
out of here.

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:19.206
I dug the truck out.
Richard has the keys.

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:28.316
Where did you find them?

01:16:28.318 --> 01:16:29.717
My dad had them.

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:37.925
Get in.
I'm not leaving my brother.

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:51.005
Okay. Oh, shit.

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:05.987
Bradley!

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:13.094
Caleb?

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:36.684
Bradley!

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:38.285
Caleb?

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.242
Bradley! Brad!

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:11.252
Caleb?

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:28.402
Caleb?

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:41.282
Come here.
No! Dad, please! Dad! Stop!

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:45.586
Hey!
They're gonna find us,
you know?

01:18:45.588 --> 01:18:47.722
We can't leave.

01:18:47.724 --> 01:18:51.525
We can't go back.

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:53.060
They're gonna take you away.

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:56.363
I know what I'm doing.

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:09.376
They'll find us.

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.618
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:19.120
Dad!

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:24.291
Caleb?

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:39.206
Hi.

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.909
Don't look at me like that.

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:50.718
If... if we stay here,

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.753
can you teach us
to go fishing?

01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:55.289
And to hunt?

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.992
- We can make it work.
- Caleb, what are you doing?

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:04.265
Yeah, it'll be fun. Right?

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:11.372
We can rebuild the house,
and...

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:20.347
Just us.
Yeah.

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:22.116
It'll be okay.

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:26.954
Yeah. Of... of course.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:29.190
We can go hunting,
we can go fishing,

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:30.624
we can do whatever you want.

01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:37.431
Go! Go! Get out of here!

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:41.535
Come on! Quickly!

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:47.074
Faster, let's go!
No!

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:57.218
Go!

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:05.226
Dad--
come on, come on, come on!
Caleb, come on!

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:34.321
Where are the keys, Caleb?

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:43.631
Come on, come on!

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:48.002
Come on.
Come on, please!
Hurry, hurry!

01:21:48.004 --> 01:21:49.637
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:50.804
Hey, where are you going?

01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:52.106
What the fuck are you doing?

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:54.541
Lock the door!
Go, go, go!

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:58.112
We've gotta stay together!

01:21:58.114 --> 01:22:00.080
Get off him!
I'm your father!

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:03.250
Please don't leave me!
Get off, dad! Please!

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:05.419
Get off me!

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.421
Dad!
Please!

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.523
Stop it! Stop!
How can you leave me?

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:13.027
You're hurting him!
You're hurting him!
It's only us now!

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:14.361
Get off!
Don't leave!

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.571
We'll be okay.
