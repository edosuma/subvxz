00:03.240 --> 00:04.765
Hey! Stop!

00:07.240 --> 00:11.165
Somebody stop that kid.
Get back here.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.168
- Get in.
- Get back!

00:24.520 --> 00:26.966
Guy's nuts.
Tried to steal my sister's purse.

00:27.160 --> 00:31.245
You stole the purse, Jacob.
Like the credit cards and the Pontiac.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.805
How do you know my name?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.331
I'm surprised you haven't stolen more...

00:34.520 --> 00:37.364
...considering the situation
with your foster home.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.291
You know,
we've been watching you, Jacob.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.248
- We may have an opportunity for you.
- Who are you?

00:44.480 --> 00:46.801
- What is this?
- According to our research...

00:47.000 --> 00:49.685
...you have some remarkable talents.
- You want the purse? Take the purse.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.042
You ever stop to think that the reason you
have trouble relating to other people...

00:52.280 --> 00:54.965
...is because you're special?

00:55.200 --> 00:58.807
That it's not you,
it's everyone else that's the problem?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.843
That's not what Social Services says.

01:01.080 --> 01:05.449
Good old Social Services. Bureaucrats
trained in missing the point.

01:05.640 --> 01:09.486
We believe
that your delinquent inclinations...

01:09.680 --> 01:13.685
...are exactly
what makes you invaluable.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.649
It takes a certain kind of courage.

01:15.880 --> 01:20.169
What are you talking about?
A job, a school? What is all this stuff?

01:20.360 --> 01:23.762
I told you, we have an opportunity,
if you're willing to take it...

01:23.960 --> 01:27.328
...if you're smart enough to take it.
It's your choice.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.006
You can go back to
the life you've always known...

01:30.200 --> 01:34.000
...or you can ride with me, and I can
tell you how to leave this life behind.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.530
I can help you become anything.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.685
Aram said you were looking
for me.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.241
- Come in. Close the door.
- What's going on?

01:50.440 --> 01:54.525
An assistant U.S. attorney here
in D.C. has impaneled a grand jury.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.960
He's looking into the death
of Lieutenant Eugene Ames...

01:57.080 --> 01:58.161
...a former harbormaster.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.169
I just got off the phone
with Detective Wilcox.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.488
We discussed
the target of his investigation.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.245
- You.
- You encountered the victim...

02:04.440 --> 02:05.851
...the day he disappeared.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.720
Drew down on the man,
fed him some story...

02:07.880 --> 02:09.644
...about searching for fugitives
out of Cumberland prison.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.640
- There were no fugitives.
- No.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.161
When Wilcox confronted you,
you changed your story.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.323
Said you were there
on official business.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.363
They had a witness,
but the guy recanted.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.849
Now Agent Cooper's been subpoenaed
to corroborate your story.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.323
They want to ask him under oath
if you're lying.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.683
We know that you weren't
at that marina in an official capacity...

02:31.920 --> 02:34.048
...as a member of this task force.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.528
So you want to tell me
why the hell you were there?

02:38.400 --> 02:39.447
I can't.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.400
You're the target
of a murder investigation.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.000
You think the best choice
now is to shut me out?

02:44.200 --> 02:46.168
You're right.
I didn't tell Wilcox the truth.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.840
But I'm telling you the truth
when I say I didn't kill anyone.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.883
Meera was dead.
You were in the hospital.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.607
I did what I thought
was necessary to stop Berlin.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.531
- That's all I'm willing to say.
- You'll say far less than that, Agent Keen.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.848
I've filed a motion to quash
the subpoena.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.407
Only 41 people know
this task force exists.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.410
I will not risk further exposure,
not by this.

03:05.600 --> 03:10.322
You'd better hope this motion works,
because if they put me under oath...

03:10.520 --> 03:12.761
...I will not commit perjury
to protect you.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.725
- Oh, sorry, man.
- Martin. Martin. Come on.

03:22.920 --> 03:27.005
- I told you Denner sits at 9.
- I know. I know. I got everything.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.931
Okay, look. I don't know
what we're walking into here.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.691
It's no small thing to indict
an active federal agent.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.248
- I'm onto something. She's guilty.
- Denner is the guy to hear this.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.326
He's former criminal defense attorney,
former Berkeley law professor...

03:40.520 --> 03:43.285
...and he's a staunch proponent
of government transparency.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.767
Well, that's promising.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.085
- We're going to five?
- Yeah. They switched the courtroom.

03:49.760 --> 03:53.560
Mr. Markin, detective.
Step over to the checkpoint, please.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.367
Where the hell is everybody?
What is this?

03:57.560 --> 03:59.210
Surrender your mobile devices...

03:59.400 --> 04:02.210
...anything that be used
to record today's proceedings.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.801
Laptops, pens, tablets.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.970
You want my pens?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.161
This is crazy.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.288
This will only take a moment.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.524
I've been doing this for a while,
but this is certainly a first.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.529
Not only did you switch
my courtroom, you closed it.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.769
- And then you closed the entire floor.
- My apologies, Your Honor...

04:20.959 --> 04:22.600
...but I trust
the measures we've taken...

04:22.680 --> 04:24.762
...will indicate
how seriously we take this...

04:24.960 --> 04:26.849
...and the threat it poses
to national security.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.008
So indicated.
That said, I fail to understand...

04:29.240 --> 04:32.642
...how a routine grand jury investigation
into a local homicide...

04:32.840 --> 04:36.811
...justifies a dog-and-pony show
of such dramatic proportions.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.281
Nothing routine
about this matter, Your Honor.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.767
On behalf of the Justice Department,
I'd ask the court...

04:41.960 --> 04:45.362
...to quash the subpoena issued to
Assistant Director Cooper without delay.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.040
For national security reasons,
yes, such as?

04:50.720 --> 04:53.291
Oh, come on, Ms. Wright.
Don't I even get a ballpark?

04:53.520 --> 04:56.729
"To insulate
covert intelligence capacities"?

04:56.920 --> 04:59.207
"To protect an informant in
an active operational zone"?

04:59.440 --> 05:03.047
With respect, I don't appreciate
your sarcasm, Your Honor.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.329
Really? Well, here's what
I don't appreciate, counsel.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.921
I don't appreciate being instructed
as to what will...

05:09.160 --> 05:11.766
...or will not happen in my courtroom.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.008
Your Honor, if I may.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.124
A citizen of this district
has been brutally murdered.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.243
Not just a citizen
but a public servant...

05:19.440 --> 05:23.570
...a lieutenant for the Metro P.D.
And the people have a right to access...

05:23.800 --> 05:25.928
...and evaluate all evidence...
- No, they don't.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.124
- We have a right to seek justice.
- We are here as a courtesy.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.601
We shouldn't have to take
the government's word...

05:31.720 --> 05:34.121
...that national security
might be involved.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.529
It's our call to make.
We're not asking for a second opinion.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.121
- You're protecting a federal agent.
- Mr. Markin, control your witness.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.522
I have a good-faith basis to believe
that Agent Keen is involved...

05:42.720 --> 05:44.160
- Martin.
- ...it's a cover-up.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.884
Enough.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.808
Okay, Ms. Wright. I take your point.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.844
Someone has to make the call
as to what does or does not rise...

05:54.080 --> 05:58.005
...to the level of a national security
concern, and we agree.

05:58.200 --> 06:01.204
That call should not be made by
the people or Detective Wilcox...

06:01.400 --> 06:03.641
...or even a grand jury.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.601
It's my job. I will hear the Justice
Department's argument in chambers.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.287
- Objection.
- And if I agree...

06:11.480 --> 06:14.927
...that national security is endangered,
I will quash the subpoena...

06:15.120 --> 06:19.330
...and the investigation along with it.
- You have no authority.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.244
Haven't we had enough
government suppression, counsel?

06:23.480 --> 06:27.690
Haven't we seen what happens when
governments' actions go unchecked?

06:27.880 --> 06:29.006
Now, you decide.

06:29.240 --> 06:33.484
I can hold you in contempt, and have
my officers take you into custody...

06:33.680 --> 06:37.446
...or you can comply with my ruling.
Choose. Right now.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.488
You've made a mistake, Richard.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.411
I agree, Reven.
I should've been a dermatologist.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.083
I will see Agent Keen in chambers
in five minutes. We're adjourned.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.487
Thank you.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.571
Agent Keen, you have
the right to an attorney...

07:13.760 --> 07:17.651
...but if you do request counsel
or refuse to answer my questions...

07:17.840 --> 07:19.285
...this hearing is over...

07:19.480 --> 07:23.087
...and I will determine if your case
should proceed in open court...

07:23.280 --> 07:26.489
...based on the facts
already in evidence.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.045
Are we clear to proceed?

07:29.560 --> 07:30.925
Yes, Your Honor.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.521
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.171
I, Elizabeth Keen...

07:35.360 --> 07:37.124
I understand we have a problem.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.767
Agent Keen's testifying in camera
about the investigation as we speak...

07:40.960 --> 07:44.043
...judge's chambers.
- Eugene Ames was a cop.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.083
The judge will want
his murder avenged.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.567
Best case,
she'll be charged as an accessory.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.331
And this task force will be shut down.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.811
- The Major.
- Major? What major?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.402
Not a what, Donald, a who.
The next name on the Blacklist.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.285
Have you been paying attention
to a word we've been saying?

08:01.480 --> 08:05.371
- Agent Keen will be charged...
- The Major runs a finishing school.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.040
The most reputable of its kind.

08:08.240 --> 08:13.246
He recruits wayward children,
orphans, delinquents, outcasts...

08:13.440 --> 08:16.410
...but only boys and girls
of superior intelligence...

08:16.640 --> 08:20.440
...who exhibit very specific
sociopathic tendencies.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.002
He then cultivates them
into charming, well-educated...

08:24.200 --> 08:25.565
...cultured, attractive adults...

08:25.760 --> 08:29.128
...who are capable of dangerous
and horrible things.

08:29.360 --> 08:34.400
- All that matters is Agent Keen.
- Which is why we must find the Major.

08:34.919 --> 08:38.561
He and I had a rather significant
falling out and I can't locate him...

08:38.760 --> 08:40.922
...which is why you need
to put me in a room...

08:41.159 --> 08:44.083
...with the Malaysian
deputy minister to the U.N.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.204
You want the FBI to invite a U.N.
diplomat to meet with you?

08:47.400 --> 08:48.890
Of course not.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.323
Inviting him for a chat with one
of your most wanted criminals...

08:52.520 --> 08:55.171
...would be ludicrous.
You'll need to abduct him.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.250
Okay, hold on. That's not gonna
happen. Why on earth...?

08:58.440 --> 09:01.284
Because he has secrets I can exploit.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.211
Listen, I'd snatch him myself
but time is short...

09:04.400 --> 09:06.289
...so you'll have to do it for me.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.569
- You're asking us to commit a felony.
- Call it what you will, Harold.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.650
But if you want to prevent Agent Keen
from going to prison...

09:12.840 --> 09:16.731
...you need to abduct
Deputy Minister Mamat Krishnan.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.681
Minister Krishnan. Minister Krishnan.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.131
Can you state your full name
and occupation for the record?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.687
Elizabeth Scott Keen.
Special agent for the FBI.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.611
- And your assignment?
- My assignment is classified.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.724
- Classified how?
- I'm part of a black-book task force...

09:55.920 --> 09:58.764
...that investigates cases
from a criminal informant.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.485
What informant?

10:00.680 --> 10:02.409
Your Honor, I can't divulge...

10:02.600 --> 10:05.001
Agent Keen, I'm here to determine
if your work...

10:05.200 --> 10:06.690
...should remain secret.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.565
The burden is on you to convince me
that it should.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.285
If you choose to not even try...

10:11.480 --> 10:13.520
...we'll discuss this in court.
So I need to know...

10:13.680 --> 10:15.762
Raymond Reddington.

10:17.720 --> 10:22.203
- Your source is Raymond Reddington?
- Yes.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.324
I thought Reddington recently
escaped from a black site...

10:25.560 --> 10:28.370
...and his whereabouts are unknown.
- It was a cover.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.251
- He was never captured?
- He was captured.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.720
We helped him escape.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.491
Are you telling me a fugitive
on the FBI's most-wanted list...

10:35.680 --> 10:37.921
...is actually an informant for the FBI?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.521
Which is why what we do
must remain a secret.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.246
If criminals knew Reddington
was working with the FBI...

10:43.440 --> 10:45.522
...he'd be of no value.
- How old are you?

10:45.720 --> 10:47.085
Thirty.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.647
And how long
have you been with the Bureau?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.880
I've been a profiler for 18 months.

10:56.080 --> 11:02.804
So tell me, if the work of this task force
really does affect national security...

11:03.000 --> 11:07.005
...why would the FBI pick someone with
as little experience as you to be on it?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.044
The FBI didn't pick me.
I didn't want anything to do with it.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.083
You didn't want in,
the FBI didn't pick you.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.126
- So how did you come to be on it?
- Reddington chose me.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.730
Why would he choose you? Why you?

11:18.920 --> 11:20.684
We're here
to talk about Eugene Ames.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.202
What, he just knocked
on your door one day?

11:25.680 --> 11:27.444
No. He sent a helicopter.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.486
I had a very simple life.

11:36.680 --> 11:40.162
A husband I loved, a dog.
It was my first day on the job.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.046
And suddenly,
I was flying over restricted airspace.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.050
They sat me down
with Deputy Director Harold Cooper.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.083
Isn't it odd Reddington surrendered...

11:49.280 --> 11:51.203
...the day you started as a profiler?

11:51.400 --> 11:53.926
I'm sorry, what does this have to do
with Mr. Ames?

11:54.120 --> 11:56.361
As I understand it,
the death of the harbormaster...

11:56.560 --> 11:59.325
...came in connection
with your work on this task force.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.648
That is true,
but you don't need these details...

12:01.840 --> 12:04.491
- Tell me about the first meeting.
- With Ames?

12:04.680 --> 12:06.284
With Reddington.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.768
I've never been so terrified.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.686
We'd studied him at Quantico.
His crimes, his profile.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.685
But when we sat down,
he spoke as if he knew me.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.365
Agent Keen, what a pleasure.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.449
But you didn't know him,
you'd never met.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.842
Did he, what,
just expect you to believe him?

12:28.040 --> 12:32.045
- Ha-ha-ha. No, of course not.
- I had no idea what he expected.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.722
I'm a criminal.
Criminals are notorious liars.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.524
Everything about me is a lie.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.848
You must've known
how strange all of this was.

12:40.040 --> 12:43.681
- Of course I did.
- And yet you agreed to work with him.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.806
Well, he had intel. He said a girl was
going to be taken, a general's daughter.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.923
We had to act.
He would only talk to me...

12:51.160 --> 12:52.764
- Only you?
- He insists upon it.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.082
A woman he'd never met.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.684
Like I said, no one believed me.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.606
And this intel about the girl,
was it accurate? Was she taken?

13:08.480 --> 13:09.606
Yes.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.566
- These men will come and take you.
- Will they hurt me?

13:13.760 --> 13:16.366
They're not gonna hurt you, honey.
I'm gonna find you.

13:21.600 --> 13:26.401
With Reddington's help, we were able to
save her and prevent an attack on D.C.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.924
But the cost was...

13:31.160 --> 13:32.764
Tom.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.807
All I wanted was my life back...

13:36.040 --> 13:38.646
...but Reddington had other plans.

13:38.880 --> 13:43.920
He told the deputy director that he had
a list of criminals he could help us find.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.122
- That was only the first.
- The first what?

13:46.320 --> 13:49.244
- Name on the list.
- He told us if we cut him a deal...

13:49.440 --> 13:53.126
...that he could help us capture the
kinds of criminals the FBI can't find...

13:53.320 --> 13:57.530
...because we don't know they exist.
- One day, we'll talk about this moment...

13:57.720 --> 14:00.530
...in front of a senate hearing.
- Were you ordered to work with him?

14:00.720 --> 14:04.202
- No.
- And he couldn't force you?

14:04.440 --> 14:09.048
So I'm curious,
if he knew nothing about you...

14:09.280 --> 14:13.729
...if his implications of some shared
connection were false...

14:13.920 --> 14:19.006
...why did you continue?
- Because it turns out they weren't.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.763
They weren't false.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.920
He knew things about me.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.044
Things I didn't even know.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.725
About my husband at the time.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.685
Whatever connection
he thought we had...

14:33.880 --> 14:37.202
...whatever history he was implying
we shared, I didn't care.

14:37.400 --> 14:41.086
You've discovered something
curious about your husband...

14:41.280 --> 14:44.568
...haven't you, Lizzy?
- He wanted me for a reason...

14:46.160 --> 14:48.288
...and I wanted to know why.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.682
He has diplomatic immunity.
If anyone finds out...

14:54.880 --> 14:55.961
They won't.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.771
- How can you be so sure?
- You need to leave, Donald.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.970
- You better have a damn good reason...
- You need to leave.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.886
Let's have a little chat.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.889
Oh...

15:53.000 --> 15:54.923
Kohl is unreliable.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.963
He is drawing too much heat.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.083
We need guns. Kohl has guns.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.921
- What about Breunig?
- No. We're not crossing the border.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.487
That's just asking for trouble.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.081
I know a man in Salzburg.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.010
Perhaps until we know you better...

16:16.240 --> 16:19.881
...you would do best
to mind your own affairs.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.884
Suit yourself.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.325
Give it here.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.846
Oh...

16:49.120 --> 16:51.566
I don't know what you want...

16:52.320 --> 16:54.288
...but you won't get away with this.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.927
I've always been leery
of the United Nations.

16:58.160 --> 17:03.007
The very concept is
comically dichotomous.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.124
Nations putting
their self-interests aside...

17:06.319 --> 17:09.483
...in the hopes of building
a global community?

17:09.680 --> 17:12.569
Holding hands and Kumbaya?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.723
I mean, honestly,
it's like kindergarten.

17:14.920 --> 17:18.163
Do you have rug time?
I did love rug time.

17:18.359 --> 17:22.001
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter who I am.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.042
What matters is who you are.

17:24.240 --> 17:27.289
A secret agent trained by the Major...

17:27.520 --> 17:30.729
...working away
as a dedicated public servant...

17:30.920 --> 17:33.207
...when, in fact, you're an asset...

17:33.440 --> 17:35.807
...inserted into your country's
diplomatic corps...

17:36.000 --> 17:39.607
...by the Sinaloa Cartel to help
them get a foothold in Asia.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.521
- What do you want?
- The man who created you...

17:43.720 --> 17:44.767
...the Major.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.688
Tell me his location
or I'll tip the cartel you've been outed.

17:50.880 --> 17:56.444
Tell me, does Hernandez remove the
tongues before the executions or after?

17:57.240 --> 17:59.971
- Please.
- I'm not interested in your business.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.811
I'm not here to expose you.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.369
I'm only interested in the Major.
Where is he?

18:07.600 --> 18:10.444
Let's talk about Tom Keen.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.370
You said that Reddington knew things
about him. What kind of things?

18:17.440 --> 18:19.090
Tom Keen...

18:19.720 --> 18:22.929
...the man I married, he was a fiction.
He didn't exist.

18:23.160 --> 18:27.085
But Detective Wilcox says that you
and this fiction killed Eugene Ames.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.328
- That's impossible.
- And why is that?

18:29.520 --> 18:31.921
Tom Keen died four months
before Mr. Ames was killed.

18:32.120 --> 18:35.966
Wilcox is under the impression
that your husband is very much alive.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.208
- Did you report his death?
- No.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.085
- Why not?
- Because I killed him.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.170
- You killed your husband?
- My ex-husband. Yes.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.885
I shot him in self-defense.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.011
"He didn't exist."
What does that mean?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.007
The man that I married...

18:59.760 --> 19:01.046
...he was perfect.

19:01.280 --> 19:05.410
When I'm with you, Liz,
I feel like I don't need to pretend.

19:05.600 --> 19:09.002
I know that you accept me
for who I really am...

19:09.200 --> 19:12.602
...and that is a gift
that I thank God for every day.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.644
He was kind, smart, a teacher.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.081
Ha. Ha!

19:22.200 --> 19:25.329
Or so I thought.
They say love is blind.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.927
- I certainly was.
- Blind to what?

19:28.120 --> 19:30.600
To the fact that
our entire relationship was a lie...

19:30.760 --> 19:32.683
...that my husband was a spy.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.441
The only reason he was with me was
due to my connection to Reddington.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.884
- The connection you say didn't exist.
- I didn't know about it, but others did.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.686
And you learned your husband
was a spy from Reddington?

19:43.880 --> 19:45.325
Sort of.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.324
I had to find out for myself.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.443
And when you found out,
what did you do?

19:49.640 --> 19:51.404
I spied on him.

19:52.280 --> 19:55.489
Interrogated the people in his life
to find out who he worked for.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.002
- And did you find out?
- Not before he realized...

19:59.360 --> 20:00.805
...that I knew.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.569
Mm. How did that conversation go?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.846
- It was heated.
- Is that when you murdered him?

20:20.560 --> 20:22.050
I didn't murder him.

20:22.280 --> 20:25.921
His boss, Berlin,
he ordered Tom to abduct me.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.243
Use me as leverage to get to
Reddington. I had a gun to my head.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.442
- That's why I shot him.
- That's convenient.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.086
- What is?
- Using your job to justify shooting...

20:34.280 --> 20:35.566
...your lying husband.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.967
- Did Reddington want you to?
- What does that matter?

20:38.160 --> 20:42.449
Shooting your husband must have been
a relief to both you and Reddington.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.166
- You're calling me a murderer.
- I'm simply gathering...

20:45.360 --> 20:47.840
You're implying that my allegiance
is with Reddington.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.850
What exactly is your relationship
with Raymond Reddington?

20:51.040 --> 20:54.169
He's my C.I. And if you want to air
that in court, go right ahead...

20:54.360 --> 20:56.727
...but do not question
where my loyalties lie.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.327
Tell me about this task force,
how it works.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.488
I told you. He has a list.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.524
Of criminals you don't know exist.
Sounds like an empty promise.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.041
- You'd be surprised.
- Humor me.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.171
There was a man named
Milton Bobbit...

21:17.360 --> 21:22.161
...who devised an ingenious way to turn
terminally-ill patients into assassins...

21:22.360 --> 21:25.409
...all while working
as an unassuming insurance adjuster.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.241
The Courier moves high-value
commodities under his skin.

21:29.440 --> 21:33.001
The Alchemist makes people
disappear by changing their DNA.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.602
- None of this is possible.
- That's what we thought.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.926

- You know Agent Keen is in court today?

23:32.960 --> 23:34.610
She's telling the whole story.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.201
Well, her version of the story, anyway.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.847
She says she never saw you on the
boat, and if the harbormaster is dead...

23:41.040 --> 23:42.530
...you must have killed him.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.849
- You're lying.
- No, she's lying.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.169
We both know it.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.770
But you'll pay the price.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.167
This is the last chance
I'm gonna give you.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.125
- I told you my story already.
- Then you recant it.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.800
You could get the death penalty, Sam.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.763
I already took a bullet
for my troubles.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.651
Ain't no way that I'm gonna
get the death penalty too.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.844
- You don't have the evidence.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.808
- Who shot you?
- What?

24:09.000 --> 24:12.368
Your story was you caught a stray
walking through Ellwood Park.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.483
But now, that's not true, is it?

24:14.720 --> 24:16.802
Not if you
"took a bullet for your troubles."

24:17.000 --> 24:20.322
- It was Agent Keen, wasn't it?
- Yo, I never said that.

24:20.880 --> 24:21.927
Mm-hm.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.604
Get a forensic unit to comb over
every inch of that ship.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.007
Tear up the floor until they hit water
if they have to.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.807

stray bullet, I want it found.

You know, I've never been

25:13.840 --> 25:17.686
I'm being asked to prevent a murder
investigation from moving forward...

25:17.880 --> 25:19.564
...the murder of a cop, no less...

25:19.760 --> 25:22.286
...on the grounds
that what you do is so important...

25:22.480 --> 25:26.724
...it needs to be kept secret
in the name of national security.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.531
Tell me why you think I should do that.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.929
Why will our democracy crumble...

25:32.120 --> 25:34.771
...if the world knows about
this task force?

25:34.960 --> 25:39.170
It won't but people will die.
They already have.

25:39.360 --> 25:43.809
The black site where we operate from,
there was an incursion.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.084
A mole leaked what we do...

25:50.280 --> 25:54.080
...and as a result, an extraction team
was sent to abduct Reddington.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.765
He barricaded himself in.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.485
He wouldn't come out...

25:57.680 --> 26:01.924
...and the team made good on their
threat to kill innocents until he did.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.640
He just let people die?
He didn't care who was killed?

26:04.840 --> 26:07.081
- Except one.
- Who?

26:08.080 --> 26:12.324
Me. He agreed to come out
when they put a gun to my head.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.045
After that, Reddington vanished.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.971
He wouldn't come back into the
headquarters until the mole was found.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.208
- And who was it?
- We don't know for sure...

26:19.400 --> 26:23.405
...but Reddington only returned after
the disappearance of Diane Fowler.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.450
Are you suggesting the former head
of the criminal division...

26:32.640 --> 26:35.086
...at main justice was a mole?

26:35.320 --> 26:37.721
- For whom?
- I don't know for sure.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.290
He let agents die but not you.

26:44.480 --> 26:48.041
This man you're not in league with,
who's not your friend.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.131
You said before Reddington
had answers to questions...

26:55.320 --> 26:58.563
...you hadn't even thought of.
Has he given you any?

26:59.760 --> 27:05.164
Well, there was a time early on...

27:05.360 --> 27:09.729
...when I thought because of his
implications that he might be my father.

27:10.520 --> 27:15.560
- You didn't know your father?
- No. He died in a fire.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.044
And your mother?

27:19.000 --> 27:21.571
She died when I was young.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.001
The man who raised me...

27:24.920 --> 27:27.241
...my adoptive father,
his name was Sam Milhoan.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.920
Is he connected to Reddington?

27:29.000 --> 27:30.081
- Yes.
- What connection?

27:30.280 --> 27:33.124
- I don't know.
- But they knew each other?

27:36.880 --> 27:39.531
Yes, Reddington was there
when my father died.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.569
You've sat here and told me...

27:41.760 --> 27:43.444
you had no relationship
with Reddington...

27:43.680 --> 27:44.806
...before he turned himself in...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.890
...and now you're saying
he was with your father when he died?

27:48.080 --> 27:50.845
- I didn't say they were close.
- We're taking a break.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.530
Wait, why?

27:53.720 --> 27:57.247
You need to think long and hard
about this story that you're telling.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.084
It's not a story. It's the truth.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.368
The man you'd never met,
a notorious criminal...

28:01.560 --> 28:03.642
...had a relationship
with the man who raised you?

28:03.840 --> 28:06.810
- Yes.
- Your dead husband was a spy...

28:07.000 --> 28:10.163
...you never knew your parents, no one's
heard of the criminals you hunt...

28:10.360 --> 28:12.840
...and for some reason,
you claim not to know why...

28:13.080 --> 28:15.731
...you were chosen to be
at the center of it all.

28:17.640 --> 28:21.122
Wait. I don't...
I don't want to take a break.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.607
I would like to finish and go home.

28:31.760 --> 28:34.047
You want something
from the vending machine?

28:48.760 --> 28:50.683
This better be important.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.202
You know the rules.

28:54.920 --> 28:58.242
Once you're in, no contact.

28:58.440 --> 29:02.047
You said on the phone
that this was mission-critical.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.891
What's wrong? Oh...

29:08.200 --> 29:09.770
Hands.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.688
Reddington.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.683
What is this?

29:29.720 --> 29:30.801
What do you want?

29:32.320 --> 29:34.084
I want Tom Keen.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.208
You said Reddington had a list.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.691
He calls it the Blacklist.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.082
And who maintains it?
Does Harold Cooper...?

29:44.280 --> 29:47.489
There is no physical list. The names
are all in Reddington's head.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.081
- So they're all random.
- No, I don't believe so.

29:51.280 --> 29:55.490
I believe that each case, each criminal
is somehow part of a larger agenda.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.444
- What agenda?
- I can't be sure...

29:57.640 --> 30:00.644
...but he always has an angle
for every case. I know that.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.764
So Reddington is using you
to expand his criminal empire.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.247
- No. Well, yes.
- And you're okay with all this?

30:06.440 --> 30:08.966
I wasn't at first, but as it turns out...

30:09.200 --> 30:12.170
...the cases he brings are more
valuable to national security...

30:12.360 --> 30:13.600
...than what he gets in return.

30:13.760 --> 30:17.526
But Reddington still tailors individual
cases for his personal gain.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.927
They're not individual.
Some are connected.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.407
- Connected how?
- Reddington got a number from Wujing...

30:22.600 --> 30:24.841
...a code that he entered
into VICAP...

30:25.040 --> 30:29.967
...after helping us stop General Ludd
in order to identify Lucy Brooks...

30:30.160 --> 30:31.969
...also known as Jolene Parker...

30:32.160 --> 30:36.210
...who he then tracked down
using the Alchemists client list.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.845
Gina Zanetakos, The Courier...

30:38.040 --> 30:41.806
...I believe they all trace back
to one entity.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.970
At first, I thought the cases were
all about getting Berlin.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.322
- The man your husband worked for.
- Most of them were.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.887
And, yes, he's using us. It's true.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.526
But in the process,
we've been able to capture and kill...

30:52.720 --> 30:55.929
...a number of high-value targets,
including Berlin.

30:56.160 --> 30:57.685
And I thought that was the end game...

30:57.880 --> 31:01.248
...but as it turns out,
Reddington has other agendas.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.123
And all of those
are connected somehow?

31:04.320 --> 31:07.051
I can't know for sure, but yes,
I imagine they're connected.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.449
- Like his recent arrest in Hong Kong.
- The cover story.

31:10.680 --> 31:11.886
He wanted to be captured.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.402
It's all a part of his quest to find
something he calls the Fulcrum.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.088
- The Fulcrum.
- It's a blackmail file.

31:18.280 --> 31:22.251
And before you decide whether or not
to discuss what we know in open court...

31:22.480 --> 31:24.164
...you should know that,
according to Reddington...

31:24.400 --> 31:28.291
...the Fulcrum is proof of the existence
of a clandestine organization...

31:28.480 --> 31:30.323
...and if its activities
were made public...

31:30.520 --> 31:33.171
...a number of very powerful
people would go to prison...

31:33.360 --> 31:35.931
...or be executed.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.686
We don't know if what Reddington
alleges is true...

31:38.880 --> 31:41.042
...and until we can confirm
his allegations...

31:41.240 --> 31:42.605
...until we find the proof...

31:42.800 --> 31:45.326
...the only people who would benefit
from the Fulcrum...

31:45.520 --> 31:48.251
...being publicized
are the criminals it identifies.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.363
So Hong Kong...

31:51.480 --> 31:55.166
...did Reddington find this Fulcrum?
- No.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.807
And does he have some other ideas
about how to locate it?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.446
- Yes, through me.
- You?

32:01.640 --> 32:04.291
That's what I've come
to believe is the real reason...

32:04.520 --> 32:06.520
...he surrendered in the first place,
asked for me.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.524
And let me guess, this comes
as a complete surprise to you.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.609
- Absolutely.
- The same way...

32:11.800 --> 32:14.371
...you were completely surprised
when he asked for you.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.607
Yes.

32:15.800 --> 32:18.406
And the way you found out
that your husband was a spy.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.489
I'm sorry. You're right. You're right.

32:20.680 --> 32:23.286
I should have known that when
we were planning a family...

32:23.480 --> 32:24.970
...that he was a traitor...

32:25.160 --> 32:28.403
...who had installed
surveillance cameras in my bedroom.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.887
I should have been aware
that the number four...

32:31.080 --> 32:32.605
...on the FBI's most wanted list...

32:32.840 --> 32:36.367
...would turn himself in
and demand to speak only to me.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.921
What a horrible profiler I must be...

32:39.120 --> 32:41.407
...to have missed the fact
that I am central...

32:41.640 --> 32:44.007
...to the discovery of a blackmail file...

32:44.200 --> 32:46.646
...that will tilt the
balance of power in...

32:46.840 --> 32:51.448
Let me phrase this right.
...the entire world.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.529
Wow, I suck.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.409
I think we've gotten a little off topic.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.845
Regarding Mr. Ames...

33:09.880 --> 33:12.121
"according to Detective Wilcox...

33:12.320 --> 33:14.721
...you said that you were
on official business...

33:14.920 --> 33:17.526
...when you encountered Mr. Ames
on the ship the Phoenix.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.411
As I said,
I was there looking for a fugitive.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.244
Fugitives from Cumberland.

33:22.440 --> 33:26.240
FBI. We're searching for two fugitives
escaped from Cumberland last night.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.963
I never said Cumberland. And I was
only looking for one man, Samuel Aleko.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.889
He had a warrant for his arrest...

33:33.080 --> 33:35.560
...and I believed
he was hiding out on the Phoenix.

33:35.760 --> 33:39.765
In what way is Mr. Aleko connected
to the business of your task force?

33:39.960 --> 33:41.928
He had been an informant
for a colleague...

33:42.160 --> 33:46.324
...who was killed in the line of duty,
Meera Malik.

33:46.520 --> 33:50.411
I was hoping I could cut a deal
with Aleko and have him inform for me.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.763
- Aleko says you lied. In his statement...
- Which he recanted.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.851
...he says that you kept your ex-husband
hostage on the Phoenix for four months...

33:58.040 --> 34:00.122
...that you interrogated him.
- That's not true.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.561
How often did you communicate
with Berlin?

34:02.760 --> 34:04.410
- My name is Jacob Phelps.
- Did you murder Jolene Parker?

34:04.640 --> 34:08.531
Why you? Have you spied on others?
What do you know about Reddington?

34:08.719 --> 34:11.041
And when Mr. Ames
found out what you were doing...

34:11.239 --> 34:13.481
you and your husband
conspired to kill him.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.286
- No!
- It's better this way. Let him do it.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.926
Get your hands off me! Tom, stop!

34:21.239 --> 34:23.686
As I told you, my ex-husband is dead.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.400
I should remind you you're under oath.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.887
I should remind you
that the only evidence against me...

34:28.120 --> 34:30.440
...is circumstantial.
- Your word against his?

34:30.639 --> 34:33.962
If I were holding my ex-husband
hostage and Mr. Ames found him...

34:34.159 --> 34:35.844
...the last thing Tom would do
is kill him.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.089
The one man who could alert
the authorities and set him free.

34:39.280 --> 34:42.841
It makes no sense.
Yes, it's my word against his.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.121
Not entirely.

34:46.159 --> 34:47.685
Okay. Send him in.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.326
I'm going to check your story out
with your boss.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.887
Good. I have no doubt
that Deputy Director Cooper...

34:56.080 --> 34:58.606
...will confirm my accounts.
- We'll know soon enough.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.325
Mr. Cooper is right outside.

35:05.400 --> 35:09.485
For the moment, Agent Keen,
I think we're finished.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.611
Director Cooper, if you will.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.644
Look, I told you what happened
with Tom Keen.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.242
- This is not my fault.
- You vouched for him personally, Bill.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.523
I hired him on your recommendation.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.249
- The merchandise was defective.
- No.

35:34.480 --> 35:38.610
He was perfect. Test scores, aptitude.

35:39.160 --> 35:43.006
There was no indication he would
become emotionally involved.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.288
- But he did.
- He hasn't been in contact.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.050
Cut the crap, Bill.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.326
You acquired Tom Keen
when he was a boy.

35:50.520 --> 35:54.047
You trained him to be a deep-cover
operative. It's all he's ever done.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.641
It's all he knows.

35:56.880 --> 36:00.566
When one operation ends,
he comes back to you for another.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.211
Not this time.

36:04.480 --> 36:07.245
Mamat and I have come to something
of an understanding.

36:07.440 --> 36:13.004
He gets to remain alive and well,
still deputy minister, and I get you.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.608
I'm equally hopeful you and I can arrive
at a mutually beneficial solution.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.167
Even if I knew where he was,
I wouldn't tell you.

36:29.360 --> 36:32.887
Keen's betrayal cost me dearly...

36:33.120 --> 36:37.569
...in time, money, lives.

36:37.760 --> 36:42.527
Some of the people closest to me
are now dead because of Tom Keen.

36:42.760 --> 36:46.685
If I gave you his location,
I'd have to betray a client.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.848
That shouldn't be hard, Bill.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.722
You betrayed me.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.484
You sold me an asset
and then allowed him to turn...

36:56.680 --> 36:59.445
...when Berlin offered you
twice as much.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.564
You're in debt to me.

37:02.760 --> 37:06.082
Recognize this rather fortuitous
opportunity for you...

37:06.320 --> 37:08.971
...to begin to make things even.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.611
Where can I find Tom Keen?

37:19.600 --> 37:23.730
I have been listening to Elizabeth Keen
describe the work of your task force...

37:23.920 --> 37:25.285
...and I have many questions.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.926
But there's only one
I need to put to you...

37:28.120 --> 37:30.726
...and that question is, as her boss...

37:30.920 --> 37:35.881
...can you tell me if Agent Keen
was on that boat, the Phoenix...

37:36.080 --> 37:38.242
...in her official capacity
as an FBI agent...

37:38.480 --> 37:41.609
...or was she there,
as appears far more likely to me...

37:41.800 --> 37:45.725
...for personal reasons that had nothing
to do with your task force and the FBI?

37:45.920 --> 37:48.082
I understand you need
to ask me the question.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.846
I assume it's to confirm
what Agent Keen already said.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.445
She has addressed this...

37:52.640 --> 37:55.246
...and eliminated any need
for me to testify under oath.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.805
No.

37:57.720 --> 38:01.202
Agent Keen put you
directly on the hot seat.

38:01.400 --> 38:05.530
She not only said that she was
there on official business...

38:05.760 --> 38:08.764
...she specifically said on the record
you would confirm this.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.849
I know this must be difficult for you.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.010
Agent Keen is one of your own,
your instinct is to be loyal.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.248
But she put herself in this position.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.086
I advise you to not commit perjury
to protect her from...

38:19.280 --> 38:21.203
Yes.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.043
Yes, what?

38:24.280 --> 38:26.886
Yes, Agent Keen was on that ship,
the Phoenix...

38:27.080 --> 38:30.562
...as part of the official duties
of our task force.

38:33.120 --> 38:36.886
You're walking down a very
dangerous road here, director.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.844
If you perjure yourself...

38:39.080 --> 38:41.447
You asked me a question
and I answered it.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.211
- Are we finished?
- I can push you for specifics.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.890
Your job is to determine...

38:46.080 --> 38:48.242
...whether a grand jury
should go forward.

38:48.440 --> 38:51.683
If you want to put me before them,
have me answer their questions, fine.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.680
But I have answered the one question
you said you wanted me to answer.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.681
So if there's nothing else...

39:03.920 --> 39:04.967
Director Cooper.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.531
Something tells me
we will be speaking again soon.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.530
- What do you got? Let me see it.
- Found it lodged in the ship's hull.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.006
There it is.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.520
Have ballistics run it against
Agent Keen's service weapon.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.324
She surrendered it
at the courthouse.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.808
Have the lab process the blood
to look for a match to Aleko.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.129
- I'm gonna need results fast.
- Yes, sir.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.084
See you later.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.762
Can we buy you a drink?

39:53.480 --> 39:58.771
Hey, you.
This man you know that sells guns...

39:59.000 --> 40:00.525
Is he reliable?

40:00.720 --> 40:02.404
I thought you had someone.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.763
We did. We don't anymore.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.525
So now we're friends?

40:11.200 --> 40:13.521
Is your guy reliable?

40:16.600 --> 40:19.444
Well, that went
as well as could be expected.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.162
We got a lead on Keen and an invitation
to sit in the minister's box...

40:23.360 --> 40:27.410
...at next year's Slasher Cup.
Cultural peculiarities notwithstanding...

40:27.600 --> 40:30.251
...I find cockfighting to be abominable.

40:30.440 --> 40:34.445
However, truth be told,
I do love fried chicken.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.051
You need to tell her, Raymond.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.881
- Tell her what?
- About Tom.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.566
You should have told her
some time ago.

40:45.760 --> 40:49.287
- I don't know how do that, Dembe.
- Yes, you do.

40:49.480 --> 40:52.086
You tell her the truth
by telling her everything.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.288
I don't think I can do that.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.289
Maybe you should
stop thinking about it and do it.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.407
Sorry to interrupt, Your Honor.
This couldn't wait.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.683
- What am I looking at?
- A discharged bullet found at the scene.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.121
It's a match to Agent Keen's firearm.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.563
Trace amounts of Samuel Aleko's blood
were found on the casing.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.364
- When did you find this?
- Five hours ago.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.608
Your Honor,
this is physical evidence...

41:25.800 --> 41:27.165
...that Agent Keen lied.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.761
She says that she never saw
Mr. Aleko on that ship.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.083
That can't be reconciled with
the fact that a bullet from her gun...

41:33.280 --> 41:36.682
...passed through Mr. Aleko and was
found on the ship with his blood.

41:36.880 --> 41:39.451
She's trying to cover up
the truth, Your Honor.

41:39.680 --> 41:44.846
And the truth is that Elizabeth Keen
killed Eugene Ames.
