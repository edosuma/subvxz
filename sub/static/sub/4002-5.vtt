EXCUSE ME, SHERIFF,
YOU'RE BLOCKING MY LIGHT.

12:27.959 --> 12:29.458
WHOA, JESUS.
EXCUSE ME.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.917
SHERIFFS ARE RESPONDING

12:30.917 --> 12:32.291
TO A BULLETIN I ISSUED

12:32.291 --> 12:34.250
REGARDING ANY VICTIMS
WITH MISSING SKIN.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.291
EXCUSE ME.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.417
SAME M.O.
AS OUR TORTURE MURDER?

12:39.417 --> 12:41.166
NOW REMEMBER, YOU TWO
ARE JUST HERE TO OBSERVE.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.083
THIS IS THE SHERIFF'S TURF.

12:43.083 --> 12:44.542
THEY'RE GONNA
INVESTIGATE THE SCENE,

12:44.542 --> 12:47.250
SEE WHAT THEY CAN
COME UP WITH.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.417
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

12:49.417 --> 12:51.000
HE DOESN'T
JOKE AROUND ANYMORE.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.792
HE DRESSES BETTER.
HE'S POLITE.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.375
MAYBE SOMEONE POINTED OUT
THE ERROR IN HIS WAYS.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.375
WHO CALLED THIS IN?
NEIGHBORS.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.917
(LaGuerta)
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.583
THEY'VE CONFIRMED
THEIR SKINNING VICTIM

13:07.583 --> 13:08.792
IS RELATED TO OURS.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.458
THAT GIVES US
THREE VICTIMS.

13:10.458 --> 13:12.667
THEY'RE SENDING SOMEONE OVER
TO LOOK AT OUR CASE FILES.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.333
AND WE'LL BE ESTABLISHING
A JOINT INVESTIGATION.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.792
THIS IS OUR INVESTIGATION,
LIEUTENANT.

13:16.792 --> 13:19.625
YOU CAN'T EXPECT US
TO JUST GIVE OVER OUR FILES.

13:19.625 --> 13:20.792
NO ONE IS GIVING OVER
ANYTHING.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.458
IT'S A MATTER
OF PROFESSIONAL COURTESY.

13:22.458 --> 13:23.667
WE'RE STILL IN CHARGE.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.083
NOW, I'VE HAD
THE SHERIFF'S LAB

13:26.083 --> 13:28.291
SEND OVER ALL FORENSICS.

13:28.291 --> 13:29.417
I WANT BOTH YOUR INPUT.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.792
MY SLATE'S CLEAR.

13:30.792 --> 13:32.583
I'LL TALK
WITH THE MEDICAL EXAMINER.

13:32.583 --> 13:34.959
ANOTHER
FOUR-HOUR ERECTION?

13:34.959 --> 13:37.125
[laughs]

13:37.125 --> 13:39.083
[clears throat]
ANYTHING ELSE?

13:39.083 --> 13:41.458
I'VE GOT UNIS BRINGING IN
A 15-YEAR-OLD KID

13:41.458 --> 13:43.125
NAMED WENDELL OWENS.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.291
HE WAS FREEBO'S DOORMAN,
WHICH MEANS HE MIGHT BE ABLE

13:45.291 --> 13:46.834
TO CONNECT THE DOTS
BETWEEN HIS BOSS

13:46.834 --> 13:48.625
AND WHY PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM
KEEP WINDING UP DEAD.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.959
I MAY BE ONE OF THOSE DOTS.

13:50.959 --> 13:52.417
(Batista)
HE'S A MINOR.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.125
GET CONSENT FROM A PARENT
TO QUESTION HIM.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.500
I'LL MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
DONE BY THE BOOK.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.667
ALL RIGHT, I WANT
UPDATES ON THE HOUR.

14:00.458 --> 14:01.625
GOOD WORK, PARTNER.

14:01.625 --> 14:02.875
YEAH, RIGHT.

14:12.792 --> 14:15.667
(Dexter)
WENDELL.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.000
I DOUBT THIS BOY
WOULD RECOGNIZE ME

14:18.000 --> 14:19.834
FROM THE DAY I MET
HIS DEAD BOSS.

14:19.834 --> 14:20.959
[cell phone vibrates]

14:20.959 --> 14:22.834
BUT WHY TAKE THE CHANCE?

14:22.834 --> 14:24.041
DEXTER MORGAN.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.417
HEY, DEX.

14:25.417 --> 14:28.667
LISTEN, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CANCEL OUR LUNCH.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.500
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.041
ROUGH MORNING, MAN.

14:32.041 --> 14:34.000
FEDS JUST INFORMED ME
THAT THEY'RE NOT

14:34.000 --> 14:36.542
GONNA MOVE FORWARD
ON THIS CRUISE SHIP CASE.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.834
LACK OF EVIDENCE.

14:37.834 --> 14:38.750
GOT A WITNESS

14:38.750 --> 14:40.542
PUTS THIS SON OF A BITCH
ON THE DECK

14:40.542 --> 14:43.417
WITH HIS WIFE JUST BEFORE
SHE WENT MISSING,

14:43.417 --> 14:44.709
AND HE'S STILL GONNA WALK.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.375
AGAIN!

14:46.375 --> 14:47.709
DID I MENTION

14:47.709 --> 14:49.750
HE LEFT HIS FIRST WIFE'S
TEENAGE DAUGHTERS PENNILESS?

14:49.750 --> 14:51.375
[thinking]
NO NEED.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.625
A WHOLE FAMILY DESTROYED.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.291
WE COULD MEET LATER
IF YOU WANT.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.208
NO, NO, I'M GONNA BE
IN COURT, MAN.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.375
HOW 'BOUT TOMORROW?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.083
I MAY HAVE PLANS.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

15:00.083 --> 15:03.000
THERE'S DUE DILIGENCE
TO BE DONE.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.875
HOW LONG IS THIS
GONNA TAKE?

15:11.875 --> 15:13.709
THE SOONER YOU TELL ME
WHERE WE CAN FIND YOUR MOM,

15:13.709 --> 15:15.917
THE SOONER
YOU'RE OUTTA HERE.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.625
SHE WASN'T AT YOUR HOUSE.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.583
WE CAN'T REACH HER
BY PHONE.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.917
DOES SHE HAVE A JOB?

15:23.917 --> 15:25.750
SHE DOES
WHAT SHE HAS TO DO.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.959
SAME AS ME.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.333
YOU KNOW, I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE
WHEN MY MOM DIED.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.750
SUDDENLY, MY FATHER'S
RAISING TWO TEENAGERS

15:40.750 --> 15:42.875
BY HIMSELF,

15:42.875 --> 15:45.083
SO I GET HOW HARD IT IS
FOR A SINGLE PARENT

15:45.083 --> 15:46.458
TO ALWAYS BE THERE.

15:46.458 --> 15:50.417
YEAH, I BET YOU
HAD IT REAL BAD.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.083
NO, I DIDN'T.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.417
MY DAD WORKED REALLY HARD
TO GET ME AND MY BROTHER

15:55.417 --> 15:57.250
THE THINGS
HE DIDN'T HAVE.

15:57.250 --> 16:00.417
SO I GOT WHY
HE WASN'T ALWAYS HOME.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.625
BUT AFTER AWHILE,
I EVEN STOPPED LOOKING FOR HIM

16:02.625 --> 16:05.375
AT MY SOFTBALL GAMES.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.959
DIDN'T MEAN
HE DIDN'T LOVE ME,

16:07.959 --> 16:11.208
BUT DIDN'T MEAN
IT DIDN'T HURT.

16:11.208 --> 16:13.500
YOU PLAYED SOFTBALL
FOR REAL?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.625
[scoffs]
FIRST BASE.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.417
BUT YOU DON'T LOOK GAY.

16:21.959 --> 16:23.166
[chuckles]

16:25.333 --> 16:27.125
YOU HUNGRY?

16:27.125 --> 16:29.583
YEAH, BUT NOT FOR ANY
OF THAT VENDING MACHINE SHIT.

16:29.583 --> 16:32.000
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.709
IF YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH,
THERE'S A ROACH COACH OUTSIDE.

16:34.709 --> 16:36.166
I'M BUYING.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.959
OKAY, I'LL TAKE
SOME BURGERS, FRIES,

16:42.959 --> 16:45.834
AND ONION RINGS.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.333
DEAL.

16:49.291 --> 16:51.208
PARTNER, WOULD YOU KEEP AN EYE
ON OUR GUEST?

17:08.291 --> 17:09.583
GETTING ANYWHERE
WITH THE KID?

17:09.583 --> 17:10.834
SORTA.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.291
YOU AND RITA
SET A DATE YET?

17:12.291 --> 17:13.375
NOT YET.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.542
WELL, ARE YOU GONNA MOVE IN
WITH HER FIRST?

17:15.542 --> 17:16.959
WHERE'S THIS GOING?

17:16.959 --> 17:18.500
WELL, I KINDA NEED TO KNOW,
SO I CAN BREAK THE LEASE

17:18.500 --> 17:19.875
ON MY PLACE
AND MOVE INTO YOURS.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.166
WHAT MAKES EVERYBODY THINK

17:21.166 --> 17:23.417
I'M JUST GONNA GIVE UP
MY APARTMENT?

17:23.417 --> 17:25.333
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE 'CAUSE
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.000
LIKE THERE'S ROOM FOR RITA
AND THE KIDS AT YOUR PLACE.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.166
NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON

17:30.166 --> 17:31.417
WHO NEEDS A FUCK PAD.

17:35.291 --> 17:37.375
DEXTER.
OFFICER MORGAN.

17:37.375 --> 17:40.250
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I
MIGHT FIND LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA?

17:42.208 --> 17:43.792
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.291
GUESS WE KNOW
WHO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

17:45.291 --> 17:46.667
SENT TO LOOK
INTO OUR FILES.

17:46.667 --> 17:47.792
BIG FUCKING MISTAKE.

17:47.792 --> 17:49.166
THAT GUY'S WOUND
WAY TOO TIGHT.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.709
AND COMING FROM ME,
THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.

17:51.709 --> 17:54.166
YOU GONNA TAKE
THE FRIDGE?

17:56.542 --> 17:57.500
THANK YOU.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.542
THEY KEEP GETTING
YOUNGER AND YOUNGER, HUH?

17:59.542 --> 18:01.709
WHO'D THIS ONE KILL?
THE BOY'S NOT A SUSPECT.

18:01.709 --> 18:03.542
WE THINK HE WAS WORKING
FOR FREEBO.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.458
I HAVE TO SAY,

18:05.458 --> 18:07.834
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED YOU'RE
WHO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

18:07.834 --> 18:09.250
CHOSE AS THEIR LIAISON.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.583
I'M NOT HERE
TO MAKE FRIENDS.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.041
I'M HERE TO DO MY JOB.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.834
[scoffs]

18:14.834 --> 18:17.917
I'VE KNOWN YOU
YOUR ENTIRE ADULT LIFE, RAMON,

18:17.917 --> 18:19.875
SO LET'S CUT THE BULLSHIT.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.875
YOU'RE USING THIS CASE
TO INSERT YOURSELF

18:21.875 --> 18:23.208
INTO MIAMI METRO'S
INVESTIGATION

18:23.208 --> 18:24.750
OF YOUR BROTHER'S DEATH.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.750
IF OUR VICTIM
CAN HELP TRACK DOWN

18:26.750 --> 18:29.041
MY BROTHER'S KILLER
IN THE PROCESS,

18:29.041 --> 18:30.917
SO BE IT.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.375
AS ONE LIEUTENANT
TO ANOTHER,

18:32.375 --> 18:33.792
YOU KNOW I COULD GO
OVER YOUR HEAD

18:33.792 --> 18:35.208
AND GET YOU PULLED OFF
THIS ASSIGNMENT.

18:37.375 --> 18:39.000
BUT I'M NOT
GONNA DO THAT.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.250
I KNOW YOU AND OSCAR
WERE CLOSE.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.041
AND HE MEANT A GREAT DEAL
TO ME AS WELL.

18:43.041 --> 18:45.709
SO YOU WILL HAVE

18:45.709 --> 18:48.291
THIS DEPARTMENT'S
FULL COOPERATION

18:48.291 --> 18:50.333
TO A POINT.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.333
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE CASES
ARE NOT CONNECTED,

18:52.333 --> 18:53.792
THE COOPERATION ENDS.

18:53.792 --> 18:55.083
ENTIENDES?

18:57.041 --> 18:58.250
CLARO.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.250
I NEED TO THANK MIGUEL

19:06.250 --> 19:09.041
FOR INTRODUCING ME
TO A NEW HOBBY.

19:09.041 --> 19:11.333
AND FOR SUPPORTING
AN OLD ONE.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.041
AFTER THE FIRST WIFE'S MONEY
RAN OUT,

19:20.041 --> 19:21.458
ETHAN DIDN'T TAKE LONG
TO FIND

19:21.458 --> 19:24.125
THE NEXT WEALTHY WOMAN
TO WOO, MARRY,

19:24.125 --> 19:26.500
AND THROW OVERBOARD.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.333
MAYBE I CAN RETURN THE FAVOR
ON THAT LAST PART.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.542
HAVE BOTH TANKS
DELIVERED TO THE SHIP.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.667
I'LL NEED
A DIVE SKIN TOO.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.500
YOU GOT IT.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.750
HEADING OUT TO SEA?

19:41.750 --> 19:43.834
CARIBBEAN CRUISE.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.000
LEAVING TOMORROW.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.375
DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD
DIVE SCHOOLS AROUND HERE?

19:47.375 --> 19:49.291
YEAH.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.875
BUT THEY ALL REQUIRE HOURS
FOR CERTIFICATION.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.208
YOU KNOW IF I WERE YOU,

19:53.208 --> 19:54.917
I'D CUT A FEW CORNERS,
HEAD OVER TO BIMINI.

19:54.917 --> 19:56.917
THEY'LL HAVE YOU UNDER THE WATER
IN LESS THAN A DAY.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.917
BIMINI.
THAT'S CLOSE.

19:58.917 --> 20:01.000
I COULD BE THERE AND BACK
IN MY BOAT.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.291
THE WATER'S
BEAUTIFUL THERE.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.542
IT'S MY FIRST PORT OF CALL.

20:04.542 --> 20:07.291
MAYBE I COULD TAKE THE WIFE,
FINALLY GET HER OFF MY BACK

20:07.291 --> 20:09.792
FOR NEVER
DOING ANYTHING WITH HER.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.750
YOU'LL HAVE MORE FUN
IF YOU DON'T.

20:19.083 --> 20:22.166
I'M SURE I WILL.

20:22.166 --> 20:24.583
THERE YOU ARE.

20:24.583 --> 20:26.000
GOOD NEWS.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.458
WENDELL'S MOTHER
FINALLY ANSWERED HER PHONE.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.083
PATROL'S BRINGING HER
UPSTAIRS NOW.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.000
YES.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.834
THANK THE BABY FUCKING JESUS.

20:31.834 --> 20:34.208
YOU DO KNOW
I'M CATHOLIC, RIGHT?

20:34.208 --> 20:35.542
I'M SORRY,
BUT I'VE HAD THAT KID

20:35.542 --> 20:37.041
AT MY DESK
ALL AFTERNOON.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.375
HEY, YOU EVER HEAR THE WORD
"BUMPKUS"?

20:39.375 --> 20:41.000
I THINK IT'S "BUPKUS."

20:41.000 --> 20:42.542
SHIT.
YEAH, HOLD ON NOW.

20:42.542 --> 20:45.750
THERE'S THIS COLD CASE
I'M LOOKING AT,

20:45.750 --> 20:47.041
A DEAD JOHN.

20:47.041 --> 20:49.166
NOW WHEN YOU
WERE WORKING VICE,

20:49.166 --> 20:52.834
DID YOU BUST THE SAME PLACES
OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

20:52.834 --> 20:55.000
UM, NOT REALLY.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.792
MOST GUYS ARE REGULARS,

20:56.792 --> 20:58.542
SO WORD GETS OUT QUICK
IF A PLACE IS HOT.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.375
SO WE'D MOVE
THE DECOYS AROUND.

21:00.375 --> 21:03.041
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT PAYING FOR SEX,

21:03.041 --> 21:05.083
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO MASUKA.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.834
HEY, VINCE, HOLD UP.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.917
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO LOOK AT

21:08.917 --> 21:10.458
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
FORENSICS

21:10.458 --> 21:12.208
REGARDING THEIR VIC?

21:12.208 --> 21:14.000
I FUCKING WOULD,
IF THEY'D FUCKING SEND THEM.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.417
I'VE CALLED
FOUR FUCKING TIMES.

21:15.417 --> 21:17.875
MAN, SOMEBODY
NEEDS A HUG.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.333
I'D OFFER, BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D CATCH.

21:20.333 --> 21:22.625
CAN I GO NOW?

21:22.625 --> 21:24.208
YOU KNOW,

21:24.208 --> 21:25.417
I CAN TAKE
INAPPROPRIATE MASUKA.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.417
I CAN TAKE
PORN-LOVING MASUKA.

21:27.417 --> 21:29.000
I CAN EVEN TAKE
FLATULENT MASUKA.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.583
BUT THIS
DRESS SHOE-WEARING,

21:30.583 --> 21:32.750
"PLEASE AND THANK YOU"
ZOMBIE MASUKA

21:32.750 --> 21:34.250
IS FUCKING CREEPING ME OUT.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.583
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:36.583 --> 21:39.250
MAYBE I'M REALIZING NO ONE
AROUND HERE IS MY FRIEND.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.583
THE ONLY TIME YOU PEOPLE
EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE ME

26:43.166 --> 26:45.083
THAT RITA AND SHE
WERE GOING HOUSE HUNTING

26:45.083 --> 26:47.000

GILIPOLLAS

26:47.000 --> 26:49.250

44:54.583 --> 44:57.417
WELL, SYL AND I WERE.

44:57.417 --> 44:59.542
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

45:05.083 --> 45:06.250
I OWE YOU ONE.

45:06.250 --> 45:10.000
I JUST MAY TAKE YOU UP
ON THAT SOMEDAY.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.834
YOU KNOW, MY OFFICE GOT
THE STRANGEST FAX TONIGHT

45:12.834 --> 45:15.208
FROM ATLANTIC SUN CRUISES.

45:15.208 --> 45:17.125
YOU REMEMBER THAT GUY
THAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT

45:17.125 --> 45:19.542
WHOSE WIFE DISAPPEARED
ON SOME CRUISE?

45:19.542 --> 45:22.375
GET THIS,
HE WAS REPORTED MISSING

45:22.375 --> 45:24.542
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

45:27.208 --> 45:29.375
WHERE WAS IT THAT YOU SAY
YOU WENT FISHING?

45:32.208 --> 45:33.792
MERCY REEF.

45:33.792 --> 45:35.333
YEAH, MERCY REEF.

45:35.333 --> 45:39.041
THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT YOU SAID.

45:39.041 --> 45:41.875
'CAUSE WHEN I SENT
THE COAST GUARD OVER THERE,

45:41.875 --> 45:44.792
THEY COULDN'T FIND YOU.

45:44.792 --> 45:47.333
THE OCEAN'S A BIG PLACE.

45:48.959 --> 45:51.500
OR MAYBE YOU WEREN'T
AT MERCY REEF.

45:54.291 --> 45:55.959
WHERE ELSE
WOULD I HAVE BEEN?

45:58.625 --> 46:02.291
BIMINI'S...
WHAT, 40 MILES AWAY?

46:02.291 --> 46:05.041
I WENT FISHING.
YOU WATCHED ME LEAVE.

46:05.041 --> 46:06.917
YOU WERE ON THAT CRUISE SHIP.

46:06.917 --> 46:08.750
[chuckles]

46:08.750 --> 46:10.542
DO YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY
THAT SOUNDS?

46:10.542 --> 46:14.959
YOU WERE ON THAT CRUISE SHIP
FINISHING WHAT I COULDN'T.

46:17.250 --> 46:19.750
WASN'T ME.

46:19.750 --> 46:21.875
YOU WERE MAKING SURE
THAT ETHAN TURNER

46:21.875 --> 46:24.542
COULD NEVER HURT
ANOTHER INNOCENT SOUL AGAIN.

46:24.542 --> 46:26.208
IT'S GETTING LATE.
YOU SHOULD GO.

46:26.208 --> 46:27.834
IT'S OKAY.

46:27.834 --> 46:30.667
DEXTER, YOU AND I,
WE'RE THE SAME.

46:30.667 --> 46:33.083
NO ONE IS LIKE ME.

46:33.083 --> 46:34.709
YOU'RE WRONG.

46:36.834 --> 46:39.625
HEY, YOU'RE WRONG.

46:39.625 --> 46:42.458
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

46:42.458 --> 46:45.125
I GAVE YOU THE CHANCE
TO AVENGE TWO WOMEN

46:45.125 --> 46:48.542
WHOM THE SYSTEM FAILED,
AND JUST LIKE I HOPED,

46:48.542 --> 46:51.250
YOU SEIZED THAT OPPORTUNITY.

46:51.250 --> 46:55.125
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

46:55.125 --> 46:56.792
DEXTER...

46:56.792 --> 46:59.458
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LIE TO ME.

46:59.458 --> 47:02.291
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

47:02.291 --> 47:03.959
HEY,
I SEE WHO YOU ARE.

47:03.959 --> 47:07.291
NO, YOU CAN'T.

47:07.291 --> 47:08.750
NO ONE CAN.

47:08.750 --> 47:10.667
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO EXPLAIN TO ME.

47:10.667 --> 47:13.208
NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

47:13.208 --> 47:14.792
EVER.

47:16.834 --> 47:19.083
I'M WITH YOU.

47:19.083 --> 47:22.250
I'M BEHIND YOU.

47:22.250 --> 47:24.834
AND I RESPECT YOU.

47:29.291 --> 47:30.834
I BETTER GET HOME.

47:30.834 --> 47:33.166
SYL WILL BE WAITING UP.

47:33.166 --> 47:36.125
GOOD NIGHT, DEXTER.

47:36.125 --> 47:38.417
WHEN HARRY SAW
WHAT I TRULY WAS,

47:38.417 --> 47:40.500
HE WAS REPULSED.

47:40.500 --> 47:42.166
IT DESTROYED MY BROTHER,

47:42.166 --> 47:44.375
CONSUMED LILA.

47:44.375 --> 47:47.000
BUT NOT MIGUEL PRADO.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.625
SOMEHOW HE LOOKS AT ME
AND HE'S...

47:50.625 --> 47:53.000
PROUD.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
