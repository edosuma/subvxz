00:05.005 --> 00:06.214
[monks chanting]

00:06.297 --> 00:08.883
-[waves crashing]
-[bell tolling]

00:11.886 --> 00:15.098
A hummingbird smiled at me
on my walk this morning.

00:15.223 --> 00:19.436
In small pleasures such as this,
I'm reminded of the presence of the Lord.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.938
-As you ought.
-And yet...

00:22.022 --> 00:24.399
-No.
-Out with it, Sister Marguerite.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.776
To hesitate is to waste time,

00:26.860 --> 00:30.447
which is a sin when time
could be elsewise spent in prayer,

00:30.530 --> 00:34.200
or handwashing Monsignor Toscani's
1962 Alfa Romeo,

00:34.284 --> 00:36.911
which is itself a form of prayer,
is it not?

00:36.995 --> 00:41.499
Of course. Yet I find myself consumed
by thoughts of my past.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.877
You have no past. You've confessed.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.837
Your sins have been washed clean.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.757
This is like day one stuff,
what are we talking about here?

00:48.840 --> 00:52.844
The people I've hurt,
the lives I've ruined,

00:52.927 --> 00:54.929
are they washed clean as well?

00:55.096 --> 00:57.098
Your regrets are of no benefit
to the Lord.

00:57.182 --> 01:01.561
Ruminating so is a solipsism unbefitting
a sister of the cloth.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.939
Is it solipsism to be concerned
with the fates of others?

01:05.023 --> 01:07.609
Perhaps one could argue
cloistering oneself from the world

01:07.692 --> 01:09.986
is itself a form of solipsism.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.822
[stammers] If one were being ungenerous.

01:12.906 --> 01:17.535
Remember when you first arrived here
and you didn't talk for like two years?

01:17.702 --> 01:19.871
I will trouble you no further, Mother.

01:19.954 --> 01:23.041
Lord, how you challenge me
with so vexing a pupil.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.250
-[car engine starts]
-Hmm?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.336
[shouts] What dereliction is this?!

01:26.419 --> 01:29.964
When you get to Heaven,
look up Margo Martindale!

01:30.048 --> 01:33.468
I won't be there, but my movies will!

01:33.551 --> 01:35.637
-[tires screech]
-[Margo shouts]

01:35.970 --> 01:38.640
[theme music playing]

02:30.358 --> 02:32.277
I wanna know what's changed
since the strike.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.530
Are assistants treated better or have
things reverted to business as usual?

02:35.697 --> 02:38.074
Yeah, give me ten inches.
I also want a roast beef sub.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.659
-Six inches.
-[intercom beeps]

02:39.742 --> 02:42.245
-[woman] Paige Sinclair is on her way up.
-Ah, shit.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.080
She's the best reporter
this building's ever seen,

02:44.164 --> 02:46.416
but, goddamn,
is that woman a pain in the ass.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.500
[Paige] Colleagues!

02:48.084 --> 02:49.335
Your eyes do not deceive!

02:49.419 --> 02:51.588
You may find my gown overly formal
for the workplace,

02:51.671 --> 02:53.214
but that is because I am, as of today

02:53.298 --> 02:55.466
formerly a member
of this vaulted institution.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.718
As I'm to be wed tonight

02:56.801 --> 02:59.387
and the newsroom is no room
for a domesticated woman,

02:59.470 --> 03:01.264
-I bid you farewell.
-[man screams]

03:01.347 --> 03:02.182
Okay, goodbye.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.727
Yes, mine was a storied run
as the star reporter for "The Reporter."

03:05.810 --> 03:07.353
"Front Page Paige," they called me!

03:07.437 --> 03:09.022
-Well, we'll miss you, Paige.
-Indeed.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.857
My shoes don't fill easy,

03:10.940 --> 03:13.818
my left foot striking a more robust
silhouette than her starboard sister.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.445
But I cannot prolong my engagement.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.114
After all, time, as they say,
is a river without banks.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.367
Time may not have banks,
but this periodical certainly does.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.620
Maximillian Banks, at my service!

03:23.703 --> 03:25.330
[scoffs] Maximilian Banks.

03:25.413 --> 03:29.250
I may lack your nose for news,
but I've got an eyeball for a highball!

03:29.334 --> 03:31.544
Why, this man couldn't
string together two clauses

03:31.628 --> 03:33.004
without ending on a preposition.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.589
I don't know what you're referring to.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.716
You could fill a library
with all the things you don't know.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.677
In fact, they do.
They call them libraries.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.387
Guys, we're trying to work here.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.931
No matter, I shan't be staying.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.724
My sweet betrothed, Baxter Bellamy,

03:44.807 --> 03:47.227
awaits with champagne
to chauffeur me directly to my nuptials,

03:47.310 --> 03:48.728
and I didn't think I'd visit long,

03:48.811 --> 03:51.105
so I left him in the car
with the windows up. [chuckles]

03:51.189 --> 03:53.483
Good, I've got business
to attend to as well.

03:53.566 --> 03:57.320
I'll have you know it's almost time
for my mid-morning confabulation

03:57.403 --> 04:01.783
with a former stage mother to the stars,
Mrs. Carol Himmelfarb-Richardson.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.576
You've been taking those phone calls?!

04:03.660 --> 04:06.621
Yes, she is as loony as a Canadian dollar,

04:06.704 --> 04:09.874
but she is a scintillating
conversationalist.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.627
Oh? What about the conversation
scintillates?

04:12.710 --> 04:15.713
She calls every day to see if we have
any information on her dead daughter.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.757
-The answer's always no.
-Sounds like a scoop.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.843
It's not. It's a pop star who overdosed.
Open-and-shut case.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.888
-All the better for opening and shutting.
-Why do you have that?

04:23.972 --> 04:27.100
Baxter, my boy,
my dear sweet beautiful bridegroom,

04:27.183 --> 04:28.559
best put the champagne on ice.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.979
I've got a story that simply demands
my attention

04:31.062 --> 04:32.897
and I just couldn't marry you
before it's settled.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.525
I'd only be distracted,
which isn't fair to you or me.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.236
Oh, darling, I've already committed
to being your wife.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.196
What, you need to hear a few measly words?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.906
Well, "I do." Does that satisfy?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.658
I do, I do, I do,

04:43.741 --> 04:46.786
and I do want you
to wait for me to ring you again shortly.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.455
[snorts] I knew you'd understand.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.624
Oh. Mm! [snorts]

04:51.708 --> 04:53.918
Now, as to the girl.
I smell beans. Spill 'em.

04:54.002 --> 04:57.588
The girl's name was Sharon Lynn.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.382
It's Sarah Lynn.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.134
Hmm...

05:01.968 --> 05:05.805
♪ Don't you touch my prickly muffin ♪

05:06.931 --> 05:10.351
Did you ever notice that this music video
takes place in a planetarium,

05:10.435 --> 05:13.813
-and Sarah Lynn died in a planetarium?
-Huh.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.440
-Uh... Hey, Tawnie.
-[music stops]

05:15.523 --> 05:16.733
Are we going to this party?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.401
I didn't come all the way down
to Manhattan

05:18.484 --> 05:20.111
to just watch you watch your boyfriend

05:20.194 --> 05:22.613
be on the internet
at his parents' fancy house.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.532
Don't parent-shame him, Hollyhock.

05:24.615 --> 05:27.243
It's not Trey's fault he grew up
in an Upper Westside brownstone.

05:27.327 --> 05:31.372
Also, I'm not her boyfriend.
We're uncomplicated like that.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.875
Come on! We're missing the party.

05:33.958 --> 05:37.337
What? No. If we show up before 2:00,
everyone's gonna think we're losers.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.965
Fine. But can't we do something else
while we wait? [gasps]

05:41.049 --> 05:43.176
Let's explore the city!

05:45.887 --> 05:47.305
-[sighs]
-[siren wailing]

05:47.388 --> 05:50.224
The Big Apple.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.310
There she is.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.313
Apparently, there's a bar around here
called Hartigan's.

05:55.396 --> 05:59.233
My cousin and his friends call it
"They-Don't-Cardigan's." I don't get it.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.653
Wow, a real New York bar.
That could be cool.

06:02.737 --> 06:07.116
Yeah, a bar! But how often are we
in New York?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.535
Let's go to the top
of the Empire State Building,

06:09.619 --> 06:12.372
like the big ape
in that movie, Sleepless in Seattle!

06:12.455 --> 06:13.748
All right! Big building!

06:13.831 --> 06:15.958
[thunder rumbling]

06:19.295 --> 06:22.507
Lord, we thank You for this bounty-- Ella?

06:22.715 --> 06:24.759
That place you sent me didn't fix me.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.762
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,
Daddy.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.474
Have a seat. We're havin' bacon-blasted
chicken fingers from Chicken-4-Dayz.

06:31.557 --> 06:35.144
I'm not staying. I'm going to a place
where the people accept me.

06:35.228 --> 06:39.607
You sit your ass in that chair, Ella,
because that place is right here.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.109
Oh, Daddy!

06:41.192 --> 06:42.693
That's what I wish I'd said.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.947
I haven't seen Ella in four years,
but every night I bring home dinner,

06:46.030 --> 06:49.242
I get an extra bucket of bacon-blasted
chicken fingers just for her,

06:49.325 --> 06:50.493
so that if she ever comes home...

06:50.993 --> 06:53.037
she'll know that she's welcome
at our table.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.622
Huh?

06:54.705 --> 06:58.292
Kelsey Jannings,
our little indie film darling,

06:58.376 --> 07:02.296
I think I speak for both of us
when I say gooba, gooba, hey, yah, yah!

07:02.380 --> 07:05.007
Tears. Feel my cheeks.
Damp cheeks over here.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.386
I do notice it's not
as Chicken-4-Dayz-focused

07:08.469 --> 07:10.179
as maybe it seemed in the outline stage?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.806
Talk us through your journey there.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.016
What do you want?
You want a close-up of the bucket?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.477
Ooh, I think that would make it
feel like a commercial,

07:16.561 --> 07:18.479
and what's so innovative
about this content

07:18.563 --> 07:20.690
is that it's not a commercial.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.484
Right, I forgot about the innovative part
of it. Excuse me.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.486
Our target demo responds poorly

07:25.570 --> 07:27.488
when they feel
they're being advertised to,

07:27.613 --> 07:30.700
but they love stories that engage them
on their level,

07:30.783 --> 07:34.829
utilizing themes of inclusivity,
as well as dunking on the olds.

07:34.954 --> 07:39.250
Ah, yes, teens love dunking on olds,
is there any way to get more of that in?

07:39.333 --> 07:41.544
-Well, we already shot the ad.
-Not an ad.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.504
The immersive product placement journey.

07:43.588 --> 07:47.216
But maybe I can find takes
that are in more of a dunking tone,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.135
as well as shots
that highlight more prominently

07:49.218 --> 07:52.180
but do not feature the bucket
of chicken-bacon finger-blasters.

07:52.263 --> 07:56.517
Thank you for letting us help you share
your beautiful vision with the world.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.769
No. Thank you.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.480
[bicycle bell rings]

08:01.063 --> 08:03.316
[scoffs] I'm sorry, it's bullshit.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.275
A gig's a gig.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.528
And Vassar doesn't accept indie cred
in lieu of my daughter's tuition.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.865
I just don't believe it.
You're a way better director than I am.

08:10.948 --> 08:14.202
If you'd told me that one day
you'd be doing chicken commercials--

08:14.285 --> 08:15.578
-Not a commercial.
-That you'd be doing

08:15.661 --> 08:20.583
sponsored content pre-roll
for Beverly Hillbillies reruns on Gronkle

08:20.666 --> 08:23.169
while I'm directing another
action-adventure blockbuster,

08:23.252 --> 08:26.130
this one set in the world
of competitive ballroom dancing,

08:26.214 --> 08:29.217
working title, "Balls to the Wall,"
if you'd told me that...

08:29.300 --> 08:30.301
You'd be super-stoked?

08:30.384 --> 08:32.261
Yeah, first, I'd be really stoked,

08:32.345 --> 08:35.640
but then eventually,
I would get around to being outraged.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.100
-[coughing]
-[groans]

08:38.684 --> 08:41.187
It is fun that we're both working
on the same lot, though.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.605
-Right?
-Yeah.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.815
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Sorry.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.984
-What now?
-[man speaking indistinctly]

08:47.068 --> 08:48.069
Again? Okay.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.529
-Yeah. I'll talk to her.
-[phone beeps]

08:51.697 --> 08:54.325
What are these new pages?
Why do I have new pages?

08:54.408 --> 08:55.535
You don't like the new pages?

08:55.618 --> 08:58.663
[groans] The content of the pages
is not the issue, Justin.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.831
-Yeah.
-I spent time preparing the other pages.

09:00.915 --> 09:01.749
You understand?

09:01.832 --> 09:04.710
I rehearsed them. I studied them.
That's precious time I'll never get back!

09:04.794 --> 09:07.129
And then some person--
I don't know this person--

09:07.213 --> 09:10.550
And by the way, I don't like strange
persons knocking on my door

09:10.633 --> 09:13.678
and then letting themselves in.
The knock is so I can tell you to enter.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.721
If you just enter,
what is the purpose of the knock?

09:15.805 --> 09:16.722
You're right, of course.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.518
My point is about the pages.
Why are you throwing new things at me?

09:20.601 --> 09:22.562
The insurance guys are nixing
the car chase.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.731
We had to think fast, so we put together
a new hand-to-hand combat scene

09:25.815 --> 09:27.358
we're gonna throw on top
of the meringue number.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.694
-So, it's a stunt?
-I thought you'd be excited.

09:29.777 --> 09:33.114
I'm excited!
It's more time spent on your face.

09:33.197 --> 09:36.492
Ever since I directed you in that episode
of "FBI: Female Body Inspectors,"

09:36.576 --> 09:38.953
I thought... [chuckles]
"I gotta give this woman her close-up."

09:39.036 --> 09:41.289
Don't produce me, Justin.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.583
[sighs] Is there choreography?
When am I learning this stunt?

09:43.666 --> 09:46.919
April's gonna be on set.
She'll make sure you understand the stunt.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.255
-And it's gonna be safe?
-We are taking every precaution.

09:49.338 --> 09:53.050
And we are not gonna shoot
until you are 100 percent comfortable.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.052
Thank you.
I didn't mean to bite your head off.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.680
-I just don't like being surprised, okay?
-Totally my fault.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.015
I should've warned you.

09:59.348 --> 10:03.019
Is there something else going on
that I should know about?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.771
I'm fine. I'm actually being
really cool here.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.190
I'm not some kind of monster
just because I don't like surprises.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.693
I'm number one on the call sheet.
I'm entitled to a little respect.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.694
No, you're right.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.196
I mean, I've worked on projects
where the number one on the call sheet

10:14.280 --> 10:17.825
was like an actual crazy person,
so I think I'm being really cool.

10:17.908 --> 10:21.287
-You are being so cool.
-Yeah?

10:21.662 --> 10:22.622
Mm-hmm.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.167
[sighs]

10:26.250 --> 10:28.044
[Gina] Can you wait
until you're out of earshot

10:28.127 --> 10:29.962
to make your exasperated sighs, please?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.839
Yes, sorry!

10:32.048 --> 10:33.799
[jazz music playing]

10:33.883 --> 10:35.051
[all] Huh? [dogs panting]

10:36.427 --> 10:40.431
[chuckles] Kelsey! You can't
compare yourself to Justin Kenyon.

10:40.598 --> 10:44.268
-What's the difference?
-The difference is he has a great agent.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.812
[chuckles] That was a joke,
but I see you're in no mood.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.064
I'm a good director.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.858
Yes, but Justin's movies
make actual money.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.778
The last big movie you were on,
you got fired off of.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.112
Explain this to me.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.323
I didn't break
into the Nixon Library alone

10:57.406 --> 11:00.034
and yet I'm the only one
whose career has suffered.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.202
Why do you think that is?

11:01.285 --> 11:05.206
Kelse, I don't know by what fancy
the fates push us about

11:05.289 --> 11:06.999
in their great cosmic dance.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.627
-I am but an agent.
-What about these stories I keep hearing

11:09.710 --> 11:12.338
about how people wanna hire
more female directors?

11:12.421 --> 11:17.551
Oh, they want to, they want to so bad.
Just not for this particular project.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.719
Which particular project?

11:18.803 --> 11:21.097
Anyone. I mean, you name it.
Whatever Paul Feig's doing.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.057
You need to get me out of director jail.

11:23.140 --> 11:27.061
Even Roman Polanski works more than I do,
and he should be in actual jail.

11:27.144 --> 11:31.440
[laughs] Yeah, for his last
couple of movies, at least, right? Woof!

11:31.524 --> 11:34.151
No. Not for his last couple of movies.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.196
Carol, be a doll and tell this dame
what you told me.

11:37.279 --> 11:40.658
I just don't understand
why my daughter would start using again.

11:40.741 --> 11:43.661
She was sober.
She was going to AA meetings.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.995
You suspect foul play?

11:45.204 --> 11:48.374
Listen to this,
the last voicemail I ever got from her,

11:48.457 --> 11:49.959
-a month before she died.
-[beeps]

11:50.042 --> 11:51.377
[Sarah Lynn] Hey, Mommy.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.088
I got out of a meeting
and we're making amends,

11:54.171 --> 11:59.176
so I just wanted to say I'm sorry
I'm such a disappointment. [chuckles]

11:59.260 --> 12:01.929
I'm sorry my platinum records clashed

12:02.012 --> 12:05.141
with the chic minimalism
of your new sun room.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.602
And I'm sorry I didn't introduce you
as my older sister

12:08.686 --> 12:11.439
when we met David Hasselhoff
at the Kids' Choice Awards.

12:11.522 --> 12:16.902
And I'm sorry I've never been
enough for you, Mommy!

12:17.027 --> 12:20.156
What an angel.
She just wanted me to be happy.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.699
What is the "we"?

12:21.907 --> 12:23.743
-What?
-Yeah! At the beginning.

12:23.826 --> 12:28.164
She says, "We're making amends."
Who's this "we"?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.499
[camera shutter clicking]

12:34.003 --> 12:37.089
You know, we don't have to go
to this party if you don't want to.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.217
What? I'm the one who keeps saying,
"Let's go to the party."

12:40.301 --> 12:44.638
The only reason I came down here was so
we could go to this party and get drunk.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.683
Come on. I've gone to like
a hundred parties with you.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.560
You always say you're gonna drink,

12:49.643 --> 12:52.188
and you never do, which is fine,
by the way!

12:52.271 --> 12:54.148
No one's ever offered me a drink.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.400
I keep waiting
for this famous peer pressure

12:56.484 --> 12:59.487
I've heard so much about
and it never happens!

12:59.570 --> 13:03.616
You wanna go have a drink? Here I am,
your peer, pressuring you.

13:03.699 --> 13:04.867
[chuckles]

13:06.494 --> 13:10.247
I'm nervous about losing control,
you know?

13:10.706 --> 13:13.751
I think drinking alcohol
might not be for you.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.879
But I don't wanna be scared of something
that's supposed to be fun.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.924
That's why I wanna go to that party
with a bunch of strangers.

13:20.007 --> 13:23.969
Because if I'm gonna lose control, I don't
want it to be in front of people I know.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.556
-Okay, weirdo.
-[chuckles] You're a weirdo.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.604
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,
Daddy.

13:34.146 --> 13:38.442
Do you think we should ADR her saying
"Daddy-o"? Is "Daddy-o" more of a dunk?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.486
-[groans]
-[cell phone rings]

13:40.569 --> 13:42.112
-Hello?
-Um, hello?

13:42.196 --> 13:45.533
Am I speaking
to the future director of "Fireflame"?!

13:45.616 --> 13:49.453
-What's that?
-"Fireflame"! It's a superhero movie!

13:49.537 --> 13:50.746
Ugh. Another one?

13:50.830 --> 13:54.291
Yes, but the difference is this one's
about a lady superhero,

13:54.375 --> 13:57.503
which means this one you could
actually get hired on!

13:57.586 --> 13:59.797
I don't want them to hire me
just because I'm a woman.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.715
Ugh. You think Justin Kenyon says,

14:01.799 --> 14:04.218
"I don't want them to hire me
just because I'm a man"?

14:04.301 --> 14:06.846
Of course not! He says, "Money,
money, money. Nom, nom, nom."

14:06.929 --> 14:08.013
I have heard him say that.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.475
Besides, they don't want this
to be just another superhero movie.

14:11.559 --> 14:15.688
They're looking for someone who can make
a superhero movie with a twist!

14:15.771 --> 14:17.815
So, what, they want me to pitch the twist?

14:17.898 --> 14:20.067
-No, the twist is that it's a woman.
-Oh.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.986
But they do wanna hear your take,

14:22.069 --> 14:25.865
by which I mean they want you,
as a woman, to tell them their take.

14:26.115 --> 14:26.991
Hmm...

14:28.033 --> 14:29.368
[man] I've been saying for years

14:29.618 --> 14:31.996
as soon as we run out
of popular male characters

14:32.079 --> 14:35.875
and we've given them each two sequels,
we have to make a movie about Fireflame!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.419
I think that's really edgy
and outside the box.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.672
Outside is exactly where we're trying
to be, in relation to the box.

14:41.755 --> 14:45.676
We really think Fireflame can connect
with today's Yas Queen culture.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.721
Yeah, I got a real Yas Queen vibe
from her.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.473
She comes in, she saves the day,
everyone loves her!

14:51.682 --> 14:52.766
-Wow.
-Oh.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.560
Didn't I tell you this would make
a great movie?

14:54.643 --> 14:58.522
Uh, pretty sure I told you, Nancy.
I have always loved Fireflame.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.567
I'm sorry. I remember now,
you did tell me that.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.652
Well, uh, thanks for coming in.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.821
We're obviously gonna hear a lot of takes,

15:05.905 --> 15:08.824
but it seems like you have
a special connection to the material.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.075
I do.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.786
[elevator dings]

15:14.121 --> 15:15.205
[chuckles]

15:17.416 --> 15:18.250
[sighs]

15:19.877 --> 15:22.087
[Paige snorting] Aw. Aha!

15:22.171 --> 15:25.591
I'm famished. Let's find a place where
I can get a glass with an olive in it.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.718
Try to stay on task, won't you, Maxy?

15:27.801 --> 15:30.804
If Sarah Lynn was going to meetings here,
someone must have seen her,

15:30.888 --> 15:31.972
and if someone saw something,

15:32.056 --> 15:34.058
then I wanna know it,
particularly as it pertains--

15:34.141 --> 15:37.561
What crime have I committed
to deserve so long a sentence?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.520
I've got a point.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.397
Once you arrived at it,
send me a postcard.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.441
The starlet was alone
when she died, right?

15:42.524 --> 15:44.860
But there was someone else
with her while she was blotto.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.946
Who was that person? What'd they see?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.031
And why weren't they mentioned
in the police report?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.324
There's your who, what and why.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.452
Get a when and a where in there,
and we've got ourselves a story.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.163
Bully for you, you're almost caught up
to where I was an hour ago.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.415
Let's chat again in an hour
when you've gotten to where I'm at now.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.375
Sounds good.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.252
In the meantime, someone in this building
might just offer the key

16:02.336 --> 16:03.587
that opens the gate to the garden

16:03.671 --> 16:06.006
with the tree that bears the fruit
that is our scoop.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.633
Get someone to squeal on an AA meeting?

16:07.841 --> 16:11.762
I do believe one "A"
of the two stands for "anonymous."

16:11.845 --> 16:13.847
The other "A",
I could not possibly fathom.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.850
I envy your faith in the honor
and discretion of other people.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.103
Let's see how that honor stacks up
against the desire

16:19.186 --> 16:22.272
to dish on celebrities
so as to appear swank by association.

16:22.356 --> 16:25.067
Excuse me, kind stranger.
I'm writing a story

16:25.150 --> 16:26.735
-on the efficacy of your program.
-Uh-huh.

16:27.027 --> 16:30.114
I understand one of the pillars
is anonymity, but if you could...

16:30.197 --> 16:32.825
I once saw Craig Ferguson here!
I don't know why I said that.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.326
[gasps] Oh.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.372
I really shouldn't say. It's anonymous,
but I have seen Robert Downey, Jr.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.417
Jamie Lee Curtis winked at me once.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.045
Colin Farrell, Russell Brand,
the Ikea Monkey.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.548
-Sarah Lynn, I've seen.
-Really?

16:47.631 --> 16:50.801
About a month before she died.
It was pretty clear she was using.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.803
Well, how do you figure?
Did she say something?

16:52.886 --> 16:55.139
She didn't, but her friend did.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.557
-Her friend?
-Large fella.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.977
I think he was a horse
or a bull maybe, it's hard to remember.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.939
Kind of like a rounder Brad Garrett type,
but with a very forgettable face.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.400
He told a story, though, I remember that.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.945
It was about a trip he took to...
New Mexico.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.699
-Oh?
-Yeah, it was about a girl and a mother.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.701
Oh, this is so long ago now.

17:15.784 --> 17:19.413
I think he had sex with the girl,
or maybe he had sex with the mother?

17:19.496 --> 17:23.333
Well, do get your story sorted,
but I'd prefer it if it's sordid.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.044
And this man left with Sarah Lynn?

17:25.127 --> 17:28.172
Do you recall anything else
about this man, his name, perhaps?

17:28.338 --> 17:30.549
No, but I remember the girl's name.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.510
Yes, Sarah Lynn,
now we're all up to speed.

17:33.677 --> 17:37.264
No, the girl from his story.
The one in New Mexico.

17:37.347 --> 17:41.560
He was weirdly proud of it,
said her name was Penny Carson.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.187
Carson, eh?

17:43.270 --> 17:47.649
"Penny Carson," he said. "And that's
her real name, you can look her up!"

17:47.733 --> 17:51.320
I remember thinking,
"Why does he want us to look her up?"

17:52.529 --> 17:53.655
[both] Hmm.

17:55.824 --> 17:58.994
So she's sexy,
but don't you call her sweetheart.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.623
-[laughs] Boy.
-Oh, that is so Fireflame.

18:02.706 --> 18:03.582
-[yelps]
-Oh, wow!

18:03.665 --> 18:04.541
-Stop!
-What?

18:04.625 --> 18:07.002
-I'm sorry, I can't let you--
-Uh, excuse me.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.296
Are you already-- Sorry.
I'm sure she's got a great pitch,

18:09.379 --> 18:11.548
but the movie you want,
it's just not realistic.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.884
Sure it is.
Wendy Wiggum ate fire as a baby

18:13.967 --> 18:17.513
and now she holds the power
of the Fireflame. It's all very logical.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.890
No, I just mean you're doing this
all wrong.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.351
She saves the day,
and everybody loves her?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.269
I mean, yeah, that makes sense
if she's a man.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.813
But it's never worked like that for me.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.231
Well, this isn't about you.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.984
That's right! It's about an exotic dancer
who's also interdimensional.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.362
No. I mean the rules are different
for women.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.365
If you're a woman
and you save the day, nobody loves you.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.451
People take you for granted,
or worse, they resent you.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.369
They punish you.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.122
The more powerful you are,
the more they'll take your power away.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.542
And I just think if your movie is smart,
you'll acknowledge that.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.128
-Ooh, yeah, sounds like a bummer.
-Yeah, it's a bummer.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.131
Being a superhero is hard.
Otherwise, everyone would do it.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.882
Okay, well, thank you for--

18:53.966 --> 18:57.386
Maybe that is a bad superhero movie.
Not aspirational enough, I don't know.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.139
But it's real. And it's different.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.226
Also, in my version, she's gay. Okay, bye!

19:04.309 --> 19:05.394
[door closes]

19:05.477 --> 19:06.478
[elevator dings]

19:07.437 --> 19:08.647
[sighs]

19:11.275 --> 19:12.234
[chuckles]

19:14.236 --> 19:17.156
[tango music playing]

19:17.823 --> 19:19.950
You're not bad for a beginner.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.118
Wrong on both counts.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.579
I'm no beginner. And I'm very bad.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.331
[both humming]

19:27.624 --> 19:28.625
[groans]

19:29.585 --> 19:30.878
-[shouts]
-Whoa!

19:30.961 --> 19:32.004
Ow! What the hell?

19:32.087 --> 19:35.048
-Cut! Is everyone okay?
-I don't know. Do I have a concussion?

19:35.132 --> 19:36.466
-You fell like a foot.
-[groans]

19:36.550 --> 19:38.343
-Why did you drop me?
-Why'd you scream at me?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.721
-Hey, guys--
-I didn't know he was gonna dip me.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.931
-That's not what we rehearsed!
-You said to have fun with it.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.475
I meant fun energy.
I didn't mean change the choreography.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.644
I can't do this. I am number one
on the call sheet...

19:47.728 --> 19:49.980
-[overlapping dialogue]
-...and all I ask for is a modicum

19:50.063 --> 19:52.149
-Breaking news! She's number one!
-of respect and professionalism.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.817
Okay, let's everybody cool down.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.820
Do not tell me to cool down
like I'm the crazy person here.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.031
I'm just trying to have
a safe workplace environ--

19:59.114 --> 20:01.575
I had you.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

20:01.658 --> 20:04.828
-I'm... I'm going home.
-Gina, we need to get this sequence,

20:04.912 --> 20:07.331
-and we are already behind.
-Not my problem.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.918
I get that you're mad, and you're
totally right, but everybody else here--

20:11.001 --> 20:12.628
Not my problem.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.880
-[Gina sighs]
-[grunts]

20:15.797 --> 20:17.382
You got that dip, though, right?

20:17.966 --> 20:19.551
[dance music playing]

20:23.180 --> 20:26.391
Okay. Trey and I will be in the coatroom,
doing hand stuff.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.853
-Otherwise, you don't know anybody here.
-[chuckles]

20:29.937 --> 20:31.813
[indistinct chattering]

20:32.064 --> 20:34.316
-[grunts] Hey!
-Sorry.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.612
-[gulping]
-[laughing]

20:39.404 --> 20:40.405
[groans]

20:41.323 --> 20:42.157
[snoring]

20:42.241 --> 20:44.618
-[breathing heavily]
-[muffled noise]

20:44.701 --> 20:46.620
[heart beating]

20:48.830 --> 20:50.457
-[man] Oh! What do you see?
-What?

20:50.540 --> 20:54.127
You're having an anxiety attack, so look
around the room and tell me what you see.

20:54.336 --> 21:00.175
I-I see people partying and passing out!

21:00.259 --> 21:01.134
What else do you see?

21:01.218 --> 21:06.348
Um, books. Pizza boxes.
I see light fixtures.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.643
I see an odd amount of floor poofs.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.271
-Okay, now say your name.
-Hollyhock.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.815
-Last name too.
-No, we'll be here all night.

21:14.898 --> 21:18.777
-You feel any calmer?
-Yeah, actually. A little bit.

21:18.944 --> 21:23.031
It's a trick my psychiatrist taught me.
It's supposed to help you ground yourself.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.742
-Thanks.
-Except for the saying your name part.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.745
That's not really part of it.
I just wanted to know your name.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.123
Oh. Okay, cool.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.708
I-I'm Peter, by the way.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.919
Just so you don't have to wait for me
to have an anxiety attack too. [chuckles]

21:36.003 --> 21:37.421
-Hollyhock.
-Yeah, I know.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.298
Oh. [chuckles] Right.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.968
So, this party's kind of crowded.
You wanna go get some air?

21:43.093 --> 21:46.096
Yeah. But it's pretty cold out.

21:46.388 --> 21:50.851
-Oh, yeah, that's true.
-But we're wearing jackets!

21:50.934 --> 21:52.144
Also true.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.063
Darling, you must keep the cake cold

21:55.147 --> 21:57.024
and the flowers fresh
for just a moment longer.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.317
This story has revealed itself

21:58.400 --> 22:02.112
to be thornier than a rose bush
and just as sweet. [chuckles]

22:02.195 --> 22:05.198
When shall I return?
Well, I haven't sorted that out yet.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.909
It seems I've gone
to New Mexico for a spell.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.161
-[wind howls]
-Whoa!

22:09.244 --> 22:11.288
Well, we're here.

22:15.167 --> 22:19.880
So I wanted to talk to you because
I'm directing a new movie: "Fireflame"!

22:19.963 --> 22:23.675
"Fireflame"? Get that money.
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

22:23.842 --> 22:27.929
Yeah. So I need an actress.
Someone tough, but vulnerable.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.307
I know you're working with Gina Cazador.
What do you think of her?

22:30.390 --> 22:34.686
[stammers] Look, if you've seen her work,
you know what she can do.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.105
She's very versatile. Really talented.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.233
But personality-wise, what's she like?
Is she good to work with?

22:40.317 --> 22:43.278
I can't risk any drama on set.
There's too much riding on this for me.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.531
[sighs] If I'm being honest,
I can't recommend her.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.658
-No?
-Especially if you have a lot of stunts.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.119
I mean, don't get me wrong,
she's great on camera. She just...

22:51.203 --> 22:54.831
-Uh... She can be a little difficult.
-What do you mean?

22:55.082 --> 22:56.541
I don't know what happened.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.835
I worked with her a couple years ago,
she was great, but, um...

22:58.919 --> 23:00.212
[inhales sharply]

23:00.379 --> 23:03.215
Oh, you know who'd be perfect?
Courtney Portnoy!

23:03.298 --> 23:04.841
Oh! I love her.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.843
I've heard nothing but good things.

23:09.971 --> 23:10.889
[gulping]

23:11.390 --> 23:12.265
[coughs]

23:12.349 --> 23:14.810
It's fine.
You're not even supposed to like it yet.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.686
It tastes okay-er over time.

23:16.770 --> 23:20.524
Yeah, I'm kind of aspiring to be okay-er
over time myself.

23:20.607 --> 23:23.443
You know, I actually didn't even drink
for like all of college.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.529
I had some shit go down
in high school, and...

23:25.612 --> 23:28.990
You know, there was this girl in my town.
Anyway, it's a long story.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.534
No, I wanna hear it.

23:30.617 --> 23:35.497
Okay. She had this man
living in her house.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.416
You mean like more than one dad?

23:37.499 --> 23:41.795
No, no, she had just the one dad,
but then there was this other guy.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.672
-Weird.
-Totally weird, right?

23:43.755 --> 23:46.133
Okay. So this girl was best friends
with my girlfriend.

23:46.216 --> 23:51.263
We all went to prom together:
me, my girlfriend, the girl, and the man.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.433
Wait, the man went to prom with you?
Yeesh.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.476
That's not even the yeesh-iest part.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.105
This guy bought us bourbon
and practically forced us to drink it,

24:00.188 --> 24:02.274
and then when my girlfriend
got alcohol poisoning,

24:02.357 --> 24:04.526
he just ditched us at the ER.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.194
Was your girlfriend okay?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.947
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it was scary in the moment.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.408
We were there all night
and they pumped her stomach.

24:11.491 --> 24:14.870
And I was pretty traumatized for a while.
[stammers] But things are good now.

24:14.953 --> 24:19.791
Things are good. Because at some point,
I realized it wasn't the alcohol's fault,

24:19.875 --> 24:23.962
or Maddy's fault, or my fault.
It was just some shitty dude, you know?

24:24.045 --> 24:25.338
Totally.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.133
But you know the craziest part of all?

24:28.216 --> 24:31.470
The guy, he's actually kind of famous.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.763
-Really?
-Yeah, I never heard of him,

24:33.847 --> 24:36.516
but it turns out
he's kind of a movie star.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.019
Who is he?

24:39.686 --> 24:41.771
[exhales] Um...
