-Are you sure about out here?
-Yeah.

01:08.536 --> 01:12.473
It's a big, free country.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.442
Laura?

01:17.311 --> 01:18.779
Kill me now.

Rest in peace.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.421
You weren't supposed
to be home until later.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.856
Well, it's a good thing
I got out early.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.224
I can only imagine
what would've happened

01:30.258 --> 01:31.692
if I had gotten home
any later.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.661
-Nothing that already hasn't.
-Get inside!

01:33.694 --> 01:35.496
-Mrs. Wilcox--
-What?

01:35.529 --> 01:38.466
You left--you left
your headlights on.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.473
Go home, Nicholas.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.441
Uh, yeah.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.816
Are you happy?

01:55.849 --> 01:57.651
You've embarrassed me
for life again.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.653
Do you have any idea
how worried I was?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.455
Still in one piece.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.224
You were supposed to be in
this house watching your sister.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.592
Ever since you started
dating him...

02:04.625 --> 02:06.160
-Don't, don't!
-Your behavior has gone

02:06.194 --> 02:08.229
to hell.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.163
And don't think that they didn't
call me from the school

02:10.198 --> 02:12.233
to tell me that you
skipped classes again today.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.568
-I had cramps.
-You know what, Laura?

02:14.602 --> 02:16.304
I don't want you
seeing him anymore.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.772
-What?
-You're grounded

02:18.806 --> 02:20.541
for the entire weekend.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.476
Mom, it's my birthday.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.178
You already said
I could go out with Bre.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.579
-Is Laura in trouble?
-No.

02:25.613 --> 02:29.583
Yes. Go to bed, Chloe.

What's up?

Are you there yet?

03:03.351 --> 03:05.753
Well, don't wait too long.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.821
What do you think?
She freaked.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.790
Okay.
See you soon.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.913
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.715
-Ready?
-Yeah. Let's go.

Okay.

Oh, my God.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.869
I haven't seen him before.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.638
He must be a tourist.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.907
I don't think
tourists paint boats.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.742
You should go, talk to him.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.545
-No.
-Why not? He's hot.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.881
I don't know. He's old.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.284
Bre, he's not that old.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.552
I'm gonna do it for you.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.821
-No, Laura. Stop.
-Hey, sailor-boy!

04:13.854 --> 04:15.323
Laura!

-Laura!

Okay.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.608
Well, me and my invisible friend

04:34.642 --> 04:38.779
over there are gonna go now
so I can die. I hate you.

04:38.812 --> 04:43.317
You love me.

-Ah!
-Ahh!

04:44.885 --> 04:46.654
Parker, God damn it.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.523
Have you been in the sun
all day, Bre?

04:49.557 --> 04:50.791
Um, no. I don't think so.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.361
You must always look
this hot then.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.795
You did not just say that.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.096
It wasn't great.
I've done better.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.498
Where's Nick?

04:57.531 --> 05:00.601
-I thought he was with you.
-Mm-mm.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.704
Find Nick.

That'll never not be weird.

you were all morning?

Parker and Bre helped me out.

Whose boat is this?

Don't worry about it.

Thank you, guys.

-Absolutely.

You want to see

06:17.945 --> 06:20.013
if your sister's coming out
of her cave this morning?

06:20.047 --> 06:24.418
-Laura's not here.
-What do you mean?

06:24.452 --> 06:26.620
I saw her leave this morning.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.589
Where'd she go?

Ah.

-Are you okay?
-Yeah. It's fine.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.544
It's just a cut.

Hey, nice.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.920
Who's it supposed to be?

06:59.953 --> 07:02.222
-Hey--
-I'm just kidding.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.191
Come on. Hurry up.
Let's get in the water.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.566
Ahh!

07:17.037 --> 07:19.473
Bre, I know she's with him.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.876
Give me his phone number.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.845
Then put your mother
on the phone.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.682
That's what I thought.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.651
Okay.
Go.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.724
I'm really gonna
miss you next year.

07:36.757 --> 07:37.991
Laura, don't bring it up.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.160
But it's gonna
happen either way.

07:40.193 --> 07:43.664
You're going across the country,
and I'm not.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.034
-We can make it work.
-Come on, Nick.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.503
I'm not delusional.
It's high school.

07:49.537 --> 07:53.106
It's not meant to last forever,
and I'm okay with that.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.276
-Are you breaking up with me?
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.911

to think realistically.

07:57.945 --> 08:02.115
[phone ringing]

08:02.149 --> 08:04.818
-You gonna ignore it?
-Can you ignore that?

Let me go get it.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.569
-Who is it?
-It's my mother.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.236
Are you gonna pick it up?

08:23.270 --> 08:26.974
No.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.942
Laura?

08:28.976 --> 08:30.978
Why don't you call Dad.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.580
Maybe he's heard from her.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.047
I don't want
to bother your father.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.649
He's probably busy with Jenny.

the Coast Guard

if you're not back soon.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.765
Yeah. Well, they'll
never be able to find us,

08:51.799 --> 08:53.901
thanks to your brilliant
navigating.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.069
I thought being as far away
from home as possible

08:56.103 --> 08:59.907
was just where
you wanted to be.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.710
Ah, hey, no need to kick me.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.244
What?

Nick, you're such
a jerk sometimes.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.318
Don't joke about that.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.721
It's probably just a big fish.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Even if it was a shark,
they basically never bite people

a seal or something.

Oh, my God!

about what happened today?

come across the girl?

I heard her yelling,

to get there in time.

brought me this morning.

Sorry about Nick.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.204
I just got back in town
a few weeks ago.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.140
Sweetie, Bruce's dad is
Richard Kane,

15:07.174 --> 15:09.209
one of our state
representatives.

15:09.242 --> 15:14.181
Sorry. Politics isn't really,
like, my thing.

15:14.214 --> 15:19.119
I, uh,
wanted to bring you this.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.989
Where'd you get it?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.957
They towed the boat
in last night.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.498
[sobbing]

15:31.531 --> 15:34.567
Bruce Kane, son of State Rep
Richard Kane,

15:34.601 --> 15:37.004
became a household name
overnight

15:37.037 --> 15:40.373
after his heroic rescue
of a local high school senior.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.975
Well, it feels great
to know

15:42.009 --> 15:44.044
I was able
to save someone's life.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.647
Truly, my only regret is that
I couldn't get there sooner.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.418
Maybe then, we'd be celebrating
two saved lives.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.421
[dramatic music]

15:54.454 --> 16:01.394
*

16:51.078 --> 16:55.048
Oh, I missed you.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.050
He's a hero.

16:57.084 --> 17:00.187
That's really the only word
I can use to describe him.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.590
Bruce has been on the water
for as long as we can remember.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.326
We insisted on boating lessons
from a young age,

17:06.358 --> 17:08.095
and we couldn't be happier.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.498
That girl--well, she's alive
today because of it.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.733
I heard her yelling,

17:13.766 --> 17:17.170
and I saw the blood
in the water.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.640
It was traumatizing.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.609
But I knew I had to save her.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.345
18-year-old Nicholas Jordan

17:25.377 --> 17:27.480
was celebrating
his girlfriend's birthday

17:27.513 --> 17:30.217
when his life was cut
tragically short.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.452
While local beaches
will stay open,

17:32.485 --> 17:35.588
officials have issued
a shark warning for the county.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.690
Stay tuned as we bring you
an exclusive

17:37.724 --> 17:42.229
look into the man
that is Bruce Kane.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.797
Don't we have something else
to talk about?

17:44.831 --> 17:48.768
I don't know, Laura. I--your
TV movie kind of writes itself.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.639
How's Parker?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.741
I've been trying
to text him all day.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.676
Oh, you know, he's good.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.811
He's great. Mm-hmm.

17:58.845 --> 18:02.149
-You suck at lying.
-Fine.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.218
Look, he--he would kill me
if I told you,

18:05.252 --> 18:09.856
but, um, when he heard,
he kind of broke down.

18:09.889 --> 18:13.893
Like, he full-on
ugly-cried-broke down.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.729
[knocking]

18:16.763 --> 18:18.798
Hey, there.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.733
Hi, Bruce.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.570
I, uh, figured you were sick
of the hospital food,

18:23.603 --> 18:26.873
so I wrestled a little
something away from the kids.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.708
That's really sweet.
Thank you.

18:28.741 --> 18:32.545
-You look really good today.
-Thanks.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.782
-It's Bre, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.584
I'm so sorry.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.819
I-I just feel like
I should be asking

18:39.852 --> 18:41.854
for your autograph
or something.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.491
No. Don't be sorry.
I mean, I'm getting kind of sick

18:44.524 --> 18:46.293
of seeing my own face
on the TV, to be honest.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.361
[laughter]

18:48.395 --> 18:50.863
At least it's a good face.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.565
Yep. I'm gonna shut up now.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.167
Sorry.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.336
Hey, your mom said
you're going home today.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.705
Yeah. The doctor cleared me
this morning,

18:58.738 --> 19:00.807
so I'm just waiting for her
to finish her shift.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.543
Well, that's great.

19:03.576 --> 19:07.180
Well, my break's almost over,
so I should get going.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.715
Hopefully,
I'll see you around.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.783
Yeah.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.752
Bre.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.360
-What?
-Laura.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.695
No. Not at all.

19:22.729 --> 19:26.399
-Whatever you say.
-Here, sweetie.

19:26.433 --> 19:30.237
Let me help you out.
Okay, what about your bag?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.239
-I got it.
-No. I can help.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.606
No, I can get up, Mom.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.807
Well, I don't want you
to bust a stitch.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.776
-Come on.
-I--

19:40.513 --> 19:43.483
[dramatic music]

19:43.516 --> 19:50.457
* *

20:04.737 --> 20:07.940
What did you do
with Nick's picture?

20:07.974 --> 20:12.512
I just moved it temporarily.
I didn't want to upset you.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.514
I know you didn't like him,
but this is a new low.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.649
Laura, it's nothing
against him personally.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.452
-I wanted you to--
-To forget?

20:19.486 --> 20:20.853
I will never
forget what happened,

20:20.887 --> 20:23.022
and I never want to forget him.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.991
[sighs]

20:35.835 --> 20:37.437
Your daughter almost died.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.407
Why can't you comprehend that?

20:42.575 --> 20:45.512
I don't want to hear
your excuses anymore.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.948
No. I'm not going to.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.285
You should be the one
telling her in person.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.686
You know what?

20:53.720 --> 20:57.324
Just forget about it.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.292
How's Dad?

21:02.529 --> 21:05.532
I'm sorry.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.501
No. I mean,
it's whatever.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.470
Screw him, right?

21:34.727 --> 21:37.530
[knocking]
One second.

21:37.564 --> 21:41.601
Laura, someone's here
to see you.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.570
Okay. Come in.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.508
-Look who's here.
-Hey.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.877
-Hi.
-How are you feeling?

21:50.910 --> 21:54.547
Okay, considering.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.983
Um, can I get you something?
Do you want a drink?

21:57.016 --> 21:59.352
Yeah. I would love
a glass of water,

21:59.386 --> 22:00.587
if that's not too much
to ask for.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.688
Of course not.
Do you want anything?

22:01.721 --> 22:06.626
Okay. Be right back.

22:06.659 --> 22:10.497
-So this is your room.
-Yeah.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.666
It's exactly
how I imagined it would be.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.635
Okay.

22:18.971 --> 22:22.375
You look so happy.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.845
Maybe one day,
I could see that smile.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.547
Could you just--I'm sorry.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.816
Oh, I--I'm so sorry.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.820
[chuckles]

22:33.853 --> 22:36.789
Here, I-I brought
you something.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.895
Consider it a belated
birthday present.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.664
Bruce, you really didn't have
to do that.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.633
No. Of course,
I didn't have to.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.602
I wanted to.
Open it.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.007
-Oh.
-Try it on.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.078
[chuckles]

22:59.111 --> 23:01.047
It's perfect.

23:01.080 --> 23:05.885
Thank you.

23:05.918 --> 23:11.090
So, uh, well, what are you
doing this weekend?

23:11.123 --> 23:13.693
Probably just hanging
around here.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.595
Well, my parents--

23:15.628 --> 23:18.865
they're having this campaign
fundraiser thing at the marina.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.568
You should come as my date.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.203
I don't know, Bruce.
It's nothing against you.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.439
It's just I'm--
I don't--I'm definitely

23:26.473 --> 23:28.441
not ready
to go on a date with anybody.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.443
Oh, no, no.

23:30.477 --> 23:33.145
I didn't mean, like,
a date-date.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.814
Just--I mean,

23:34.847 --> 23:37.083
my parents--they asked me
to bring some friends,

23:37.116 --> 23:38.951
and I mean,
you're the only friend

23:38.985 --> 23:40.753
I've made since being back.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.489
I don't even know
if I have anything to wear

23:42.522 --> 23:43.923
to something like that.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.458
Oh, no.
Don't worry about that.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.760
I'll take care of everything.

23:47.794 --> 23:52.732
Please, I mean, you'd really be
doing me a favor this time.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.867
-Sure.
-Really?

23:54.901 --> 23:58.605
Yeah. I mean, why not?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.573
[doorbell rings]

24:06.579 --> 24:10.216
Laura, could you
come down here?

24:11.651 --> 24:13.219
What is it?

24:13.252 --> 24:17.690
Uh, I don't know.
You tell me.

24:17.724 --> 24:20.727
Oh, it's gorgeous.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.163
I tell you.

24:24.196 --> 24:27.166
-Go on.
-Oh, I just didn't think

24:27.199 --> 24:28.935
they made guys
like this anymore.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.503
Are you sure you don't want
to just go tonight?

24:30.537 --> 24:32.672
No.
You better go get ready.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.641
You're gonna be late.

24:39.111 --> 24:42.081
[soft music]

24:42.114 --> 24:49.055
*

24:55.795 --> 24:58.998
May I tell you something,
you know, as a friend?

24:59.031 --> 25:00.266
Yeah.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.735
You look stunning
in that dress.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.605
You've got killer taste.

25:05.638 --> 25:08.307
-Oh, no. We've been spotted.
-By who?

25:08.340 --> 25:11.544
-Just smile and nod.
-Bruce, sweetheart.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.012
Hey.
Mom, Dad.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.247
We were just bragging about
our son, the hero.

25:15.281 --> 25:18.084
And is this the young lady
herself? Laura, right?

25:18.117 --> 25:20.620
-Yeah. It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise, darling.

25:20.653 --> 25:23.255
That dress,
it's gorgeous on you.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.725
Thank you.
Bruce picked it out.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.760
Well, we're glad
you could make it tonight.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.762
Bruce told us about the ordeal
that you went through.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.731
My God, what a brave girl.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.232
Bruce was really
the brave one.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.735
Well, he's turning
into a good man.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.937
-It's nice he's dating again.
-Yeah.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.672
-You must be very special.
-What?

25:39.706 --> 25:41.307
It's just been such
a long time

25:41.340 --> 25:44.176
since Bruce has introduced us
to any of his girlfriends.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.745
Oh, me and--

25:45.778 --> 25:46.979
Mom, do you--do you
want another drink?

25:47.013 --> 25:51.017
-Sure. Thank you.
-Be right back.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.754
-Bruce, what was that?
-I can explain.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.322
I thought I made it
very clear--

25:56.355 --> 25:57.924
No.
You did, absolutely.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.792
-Okay. Well, then go tell them.
-I'm sorry.

25:59.826 --> 26:03.329
It's just my parents--they worry
I keep to myself too much,

26:03.362 --> 26:04.931
and when I told them
I was bringing you,

26:04.964 --> 26:06.999
they just assumed
we were together,

26:07.033 --> 26:09.168
and I didn't have the heart
to tell them otherwise.

26:09.201 --> 26:12.138
-But you know how parents are.
-I don't know, Bruce.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.107
Please, Laura,
just for tonight.

26:17.777 --> 26:21.681
-Okay.
-You're the best.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.650
I'll be right back.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.888
[gasps]

26:28.921 --> 26:29.889
-Parker.
-Hey.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.323
-Hey.
-Look at you,

26:31.357 --> 26:33.392
all painted up
and hobnobbing with the elites.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.162
No. I'm just doing
a favor for a friend.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.264
Hey, thanks for not
responding to my text, jerk.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.132
Okay. Yeah. Sorry.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.168
Look, I wanted to visit you
in the hospital. I--

26:42.201 --> 26:43.703
Yeah. I know.
It's okay.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.304
Bre told me you weren't
doing so hot.

26:45.337 --> 26:48.207
Yeah. So you're coming back
to school soon, right?

26:48.240 --> 26:50.042
-Yeah. Monday.
-Awesome.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.644
Look, everyone's
been missing you.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.746
It's been kind of
depressing, actually.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.014
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.649
-Laura, darling--
-Oh, I should go.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.017
This is the photographer
from "The Register,"

26:58.050 --> 26:59.285
and he'd like to take
Bruce's picture

26:59.318 --> 27:03.956
with his new girlfriend
as a follow-up.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.358
-Perfect, perfect.
-Back up. Perfect.

27:06.392 --> 27:09.328
Together.
Smile.

27:16.268 --> 27:19.238
[dramatic music]

27:19.271 --> 27:26.212
* *

27:41.994 --> 27:44.697
Laura,
I thought that was you.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.033
Mr. Alves, how are you?

27:47.066 --> 27:48.901
"How are you,"
is the question.

27:48.935 --> 27:51.137
I'm good. I'm excited to get
back to school.

27:51.170 --> 27:54.273
Good to know. Everybody's
thinking about you there.

27:54.306 --> 27:57.409
Laura, everything all right?

27:57.443 --> 27:59.946
-Bruce, this is Mr. Alves.
-Bruce Kane.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.414
The whole town knows
who you are, Mr. Kane.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.384
Not a day goes by we don't read
about you in the paper.

28:05.417 --> 28:08.120
Well, I wish they'd stop.
There's nothing left to say.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.056
What a modest, young man.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.491
Bruce, Mr. Alves
is my English teacher.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.960
Oh, really?

28:13.993 --> 28:15.361
I got certified to sub
at the school,

28:15.394 --> 28:17.129
it's just there've been
no openings.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.798
Well, the year's coming
to a close,

28:18.831 --> 28:20.933
and most of us have already
used all our sick days.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.134
I figured.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.369
Well, hopefully,
something comes up.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.171
-It's a shark.
-You never know.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.173
-Laura, Laura--
-Hurry! Get out!

28:27.206 --> 28:31.010
It's a shark.
It's a shark.

28:33.780 --> 28:36.448
Wait. Are you okay?

28:36.482 --> 28:39.886
I'm so sorry.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.120
It's okay.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.390
It's--Laura, Laura, stop.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.458
-I'm just gonna go home, okay?
-No. Please, don't.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.127
Look, just--
just come back in.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.896
I can't, Bruce.
That was so embarrassing.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.064
Hey, it was my fault.
All right?

28:52.098 --> 28:55.835
I should've known that being
by the ocean was a bad idea.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.804
You know what?
Let's just get out of here.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.772
-But it's your parents' party.
-Please.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.908
Dick and Lily, they're
in full campaign mode right now.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.943
They won't even notice.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.912
Come on.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.916
[chuckles]

29:09.949 --> 29:12.251
You know, my mom's
totally got the hots for you.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.286
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.456
She thinks you're so dreamy.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.159
Well, you can tell her
I'm flattered.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.527
You should be.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.030
She's really picky about men.

29:24.063 --> 29:27.867
Not for herself,
just the guys that I date.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.871
She hated Nick.
Like, hated him.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.140
And why's that?

29:34.173 --> 29:37.109
I think it's because he
reminded her a lot of my dad.

29:37.143 --> 29:41.881
So textbook, right?

29:41.914 --> 29:44.817
Nick was a good guy, though.

29:44.851 --> 29:48.487
Way better than
my dad ever was.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.456
Come here.

29:56.262 --> 30:00.299
Do you think about him a lot?

30:00.332 --> 30:02.568
All the time...

30:02.601 --> 30:06.538
[chuckles]
obviously.

30:06.572 --> 30:11.343
You know, your first love
never really goes away.

30:11.377 --> 30:15.314
I mean, I think
about mine every day.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.249
Why aren't you together?

30:17.283 --> 30:21.287
It's complicated.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.856
I still see her sometimes.

30:23.890 --> 30:28.861
She's always there
when I need someone to talk to.

30:28.895 --> 30:31.597
Sounds nice.

30:31.630 --> 30:34.133
You're really lucky.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.136
[soft music]

30:37.169 --> 30:40.406
*

30:40.439 --> 30:45.011
I love this song.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.880
May I have this dance?

30:47.914 --> 30:51.884
-We're in your back yard.
-Yeah, and?

30:51.918 --> 30:55.521
What?
Okay.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.056
All right, sailor-boy.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.058
Let's see what you got.

30:59.091 --> 31:05.497
*

31:05.531 --> 31:07.466
This is weird.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.639
-Laura?
-Yeah?

31:13.672 --> 31:16.042
-Let's go swimming.
-Right now?

31:16.075 --> 31:17.643
Yeah.

31:17.676 --> 31:22.181
I'll go, change, and my mom
has extra swimsuits for guests.

31:22.214 --> 31:26.318
Um, me and water aren't really
on speaking terms right now.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.054
It's just a pool,

31:28.087 --> 31:31.190
and I'll be there
with you the whole time.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.259
Now, come on, Ali.
It'll be fun.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.327
Who's Ali?

31:35.361 --> 31:37.997
I'm so sorry. That--

31:38.030 --> 31:41.133
-Is that your ex-girlfriend?
-Yeah.

31:41.167 --> 31:42.534
-Yeah.
-That--

31:42.568 --> 31:46.205
That's all right.
Nice Freudian slip.

31:46.238 --> 31:50.376
Well, about that swim, Laura?

31:50.409 --> 31:52.344
Yeah.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.559
[soft music]

32:07.593 --> 32:14.533
*

32:34.086 --> 32:36.022
[water splashes]

32:48.467 --> 32:50.402
Coming in?

33:03.782 --> 33:06.718
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.467
No. It's okay.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.771
I mean, you know you can call
me any time of the day.

33:25.804 --> 33:29.408
Yeah.
Of course, I miss you, Ali.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.377
I miss you every day.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.715
Hey, stop that. You know
I'll see you soon enough.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.824
[dramatic music]

33:45.857 --> 33:52.798
*

34:01.740 --> 34:03.475
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.678
I just got to get
back into it.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.414
Have you talked to Parker?

34:08.447 --> 34:10.581
Yeah. I tried to,
but he's been dodging my calls,

34:10.616 --> 34:12.118
which never happens.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.152
He must be pretty pissed.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.222
That's an understatement.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.123
How was last night?

34:18.157 --> 34:19.757
It was fine.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.460
[chuckles]
Just fine?

34:22.494 --> 34:24.130
I mean, I went there,

34:24.163 --> 34:25.731
and I embarrassed myself
in front of the whole town,

34:25.764 --> 34:28.400
then I left.
So fine.

34:28.434 --> 34:33.172
-Okay. Well, how's Bruce?
-Good.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.606
-Hey, Bre.
-Hi, Mrs. Wilcox.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.242
What are you girls up to?

34:36.275 --> 34:38.409
Just talking about frivolous,
girly matters.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.312
I was actually
just grilling your daughter

34:40.346 --> 34:42.313
on every little detail
from last night.

34:42.348 --> 34:43.614
She must've had a good time,

34:43.649 --> 34:45.451
since she kept her
mother up half the night

34:45.484 --> 34:47.286
worrying about where she was.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.388
I already said
I'm sorry about that.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.657
We just--
we--I came home right after.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.324
Yes.
Well, I'm sure your friend,

34:53.359 --> 34:56.128
Bruce,
took very good care of you.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.396
Oh, hey, listen.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.797
I've got to work late tonight.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.299
Don't let Chloe stay up.

35:00.332 --> 35:01.533
-I won't.
-Bye.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.735
Bye.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.271
You totally hooked up
with him.

35:05.304 --> 35:08.840
Sorry.

35:08.874 --> 35:11.510
I don't know.
I feel really guilty.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.212
I mean, we went back
to his place.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.847
We started drinking,
and please, don't tell anyone.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.450
Okay. I mean,
do you want to be with him?

35:18.484 --> 35:22.721
Uh, I don't know. No.
I was--I was vulnerable.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.891
Okay. You better let him know
now before he gets too attached.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.393
Yeah. That's not gonna happen.

35:27.426 --> 35:28.727
He's still hung up on his ex.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.730
[dramatic music]

35:31.763 --> 35:37.203
*

35:37.236 --> 35:41.540
That shark is still out there.

35:41.573 --> 35:45.677
The shark is still out there.

35:45.711 --> 35:48.647
That shark is still out there.

35:53.352 --> 35:57.456
The shark is still out there.

35:57.489 --> 36:01.727
At the end of the day,
that shark is still out there.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.362
And I just can't
in my right mind

36:03.395 --> 36:05.197
let it take another
innocent life.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.532
Hey, what are you doing?

36:06.565 --> 36:08.367
I thought you wanted
to go to the beach.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.869
I'm gonna hunt it down,
find it, and kill it...

36:10.902 --> 36:15.841
-Your boyfriend's on TV again.
- For Nick and for Laura.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.963
[phone ringing]

36:41.900 --> 36:43.569
-Hello.
-You know, you should

36:43.602 --> 36:45.237
really put some sunscreen on.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.205
You're starting to get
a little red.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.349
-Hi.
-Hey.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.518
Here.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.387
-What are these for?
-Well, a guy should never need

37:01.420 --> 37:06.458
a reason to buy
a pretty girl flowers.

37:06.492 --> 37:08.594
How'd you know
that I was here?

37:08.627 --> 37:09.695
What?

37:09.728 --> 37:12.564
No "thank-you"?

37:12.598 --> 37:16.034
Thank you. Thank you.
They're beautiful.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.836
And did you happen to catch
the news this afternoon?

37:17.869 --> 37:19.838
[phone ringing]

37:19.871 --> 37:22.974
Sorry.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.776
Well, is everything okay?

37:24.810 --> 37:28.714
Yeah, um, that just used
to be Nick's ringtone.

37:28.747 --> 37:32.050
Listen, we need to talk.

37:32.083 --> 37:36.688
That phrase is never the start
of a good conversation.

37:36.722 --> 37:40.492
What happened last night,
it shouldn't have happened.

37:40.526 --> 37:44.763
I just need some time
and some space.

37:44.796 --> 37:47.065
Yeah, for sure.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.634
You take all the time
you need.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.035
No pressure.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.870
-Really?
-Yeah.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.939
-Cool.
I--thanks.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.308
Well, what'd you think
I'd say?

37:56.342 --> 37:57.943
I don't know.
I kind of thought

37:57.976 --> 37:59.745
maybe you'd hate me

37:59.778 --> 38:01.547
or never want to talk
to me again.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.383
No. I'm not going anywhere.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.352
Don't worry.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.027
I don't want it to end,

38:16.061 --> 38:18.630
but it's for the best.

38:18.664 --> 38:22.334
We have to move on.

38:22.368 --> 38:25.337
But you're my everything.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.305
I can't live without you.

38:29.375 --> 38:32.310
[screaming]

38:45.491 --> 38:47.393
Hey, babe. It's Ali.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.994
I miss you.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.963
Call me back, okay?
I want to see you soon.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.911
Hey, Laura.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.613
-Hey.
-Hi.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.748
-You good?
-I think I'm gonna puke.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.917
-Why?
-I don't want to be that girl,

39:11.950 --> 39:13.419
you know?

39:13.452 --> 39:15.120
Are people staring?
They're staring.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.788
Relax, okay?
It's just a school day.

39:16.822 --> 39:19.057
It's like any normal
school day.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.093
No one is going to stare.

39:22.127 --> 39:25.497
Well...maybe a few people
are staring.

39:27.098 --> 39:30.135
Parker.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.703
Parker, what's going on?

39:31.737 --> 39:33.472
Why is everyone acting
like I murdered a puppy?

39:33.505 --> 39:35.474
Did you not read
the paper this morning?

39:35.507 --> 39:38.644
No, because we're not 70.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.917
Well, that's
a little distasteful.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.886
What?
The headline or the bitch

39:47.919 --> 39:50.188
that's flaunting her man around
not a week after Nick's death?

39:50.221 --> 39:55.794
There's nothing going on
between me and Bruce. Screw you.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.763
-Really?
-Really.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.739
Oh, sorry.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.040
Laura, hey.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.909
What are you
doing here, Bruce?

40:10.942 --> 40:13.044
It's Mr. Kane here.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.947
I'm subbing for Mr. Alves.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.116
Didn't I say I needed
some space?

40:18.149 --> 40:21.687
Laura, I applied to work here
long before I met you.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.221
Isn't this gonna be kind
of awkward though?

40:23.254 --> 40:25.457
I didn't pick your class.

40:25.491 --> 40:27.459
It's what was open,

40:27.493 --> 40:29.861
and I couldn't pass
on this opportunity.

40:29.895 --> 40:32.964
We can both be
mature about this.

40:32.998 --> 40:36.034
Yeah. You're right.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.937
Oh, I'm glad
to see you're wearing it.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.006
[bell ringing]

40:41.039 --> 40:45.143
You have no idea how happy it
makes me to see it on you again.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.112
[chuckles]

40:59.791 --> 41:01.159
Good morning, class.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.094
I'm Mr. Kane.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.263
If you could get your books out,
we can get started.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.698
Where's Mr. Alves?

41:06.732 --> 41:09.801
Mr. Alves had
a bad fall last night.

41:09.835 --> 41:12.538
Now, he'll probably
be out for a while.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.906
All right. So going from where
you guys left off

41:14.940 --> 41:16.775
with Mr. Alves,
who can tell me

41:16.808 --> 41:21.547
why Hester was ostracized
from the community?

41:21.580 --> 41:23.515
Anybody?

41:26.051 --> 41:28.286
Ah, yes, Parker?

41:28.319 --> 41:30.922
Yeah. She couldn't bother
to keep her legs closed

41:30.956 --> 41:32.658
when she thought
her husband died at sea.

41:32.691 --> 41:34.025
Well, I mean, I think

41:34.059 --> 41:35.961
there's a little bit more
to it than that.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.830
Do you care to elaborate?

41:38.864 --> 41:41.099
Why don't you ask Laura?
How long does it take

41:41.132 --> 41:42.868
to put makeup on two faces
in the morning?

41:42.901 --> 41:44.603
One more word and I'll kick
your balls

41:44.636 --> 41:46.071
-straight into your throat.
-Excuse me.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.973
Did you hear what she said?
She just threatened me.

41:48.006 --> 41:51.176
I did hear that.
Yes.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.111
Hardly a threat,
considering you'd actually have

41:53.144 --> 41:57.683
to have a pair for her to kick.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.918
-You can't say that to me.
-Well, that's funny,

41:59.951 --> 42:02.120
because I just did.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.155
Now, go to the office.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.765
All right.
So can anybody else tell me

42:13.799 --> 42:17.235
why Hester was ostracized
from the community?

42:21.940 --> 42:24.576
Attention, students.
On your way out for the day,

42:24.610 --> 42:26.044
please make sure
to get your cap and gown

42:26.077 --> 42:28.179
ordered in the main office.

44:31.402 --> 44:33.338
[coughs]

44:54.159 --> 44:56.227
It's weird that he showed up
like that my first day back.

44:56.261 --> 44:59.430
-Right?
-Bruce has been talking about

44:59.464 --> 45:02.100
teaching since he started
at the hospital.

45:02.133 --> 45:04.335
That's why he volunteered
for pediatrics.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.838
Yeah. Of course,
you'd take his side.

45:06.872 --> 45:08.740
There are no sides.

45:08.774 --> 45:11.142
I just think you're blowing
this thing out of proportion.

45:11.176 --> 45:13.144
Okay.

45:13.178 --> 45:16.181
But it just made me feel
really uncomfortable.

45:16.214 --> 45:18.216
I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:18.249 --> 45:20.185
He's a really nice guy.

45:22.553 --> 45:25.290
-Hey.
-What a coincidence.

45:25.323 --> 45:26.958
I thought that was you guys.

45:26.992 --> 45:29.127
Laura was just telling me
about your teaching job.

45:29.160 --> 45:31.162
-Congratulations.
-Oh, thank you, thank you.

45:31.196 --> 45:33.298
-That's great.
-What are you doing here?

45:33.331 --> 45:36.434
-Laura--
-I'm shopping.

45:36.467 --> 45:38.904
Oh, you took the necklace off.

45:38.937 --> 45:41.773
I just didn't want to lose it.

45:41.807 --> 45:44.075
-Bruce?
-Liz?

45:44.109 --> 45:45.476
-Hi.
-Hey.

45:45.510 --> 45:48.980
-It's been so long.
-It has.

45:49.014 --> 45:50.882
Well, Liz Vaughn,

45:50.916 --> 45:52.250
-this is Sandy Wilcox...
-Hi.

45:52.283 --> 45:53.251
-How do you do?
-And Laura.

45:53.284 --> 45:55.453
Laura, of course.

45:55.486 --> 45:57.188
I'm so sorry for your loss.

45:57.222 --> 45:59.490
Thank you.

45:59.524 --> 46:03.328
The whole family was so proud
seeing you all over the news.

46:03.361 --> 46:04.796
Well, how are they doing?

46:04.830 --> 46:06.431
-Are they good?
-Yeah. They're good.

46:06.464 --> 46:08.066
Mom and Dad ask about you.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.534
You should come,
say hi sometime.

46:09.567 --> 46:11.436
Yeah. I will, definitely.

46:11.469 --> 46:15.473
How do you guys
know each other?

46:15.506 --> 46:18.844
Bruce used to date
my sister, Alison.

46:18.877 --> 46:21.379
Well, I should get going.
I'm sorry.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.081
It was--it was so good
to see you.

46:23.114 --> 46:24.482
Oh, yeah.

46:24.515 --> 46:26.051
And give my best to
the family. All right?

46:26.084 --> 46:28.453
-All right. Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

46:28.486 --> 46:32.290
-It was nice meeting you.
-You too.

46:32.323 --> 46:34.559
-What?
-So weird.

46:34.592 --> 46:36.361
Ugh, Laura.

46:36.394 --> 46:38.363
The hero of Hunter's Cove,

46:38.396 --> 46:40.198
who recently helped rescue
a young girl

46:40.231 --> 46:42.133
from the jaws
of a bloodthirsty shark

46:42.167 --> 46:44.836
is going out to search
for the massive predator.

46:44.870 --> 46:46.537
Bruce Kane is setting
sail today,

46:46.571 --> 46:49.007
determined to track down
that very shark

46:49.040 --> 46:50.876
that took
Nicholas Jordan's life.

46:50.909 --> 46:53.811
Stay tuned for more
on this continuing story.

What happened?

47:51.602 --> 47:54.639
Nothing.

47:54.672 --> 47:56.541
All right.
Everything off your desk

47:56.574 --> 47:58.609
except for a pen or pencil.

Yeah. Fine.

*

48:36.014 --> 48:39.017
What happened to him?

48:39.050 --> 48:41.152
Katherine told me
he got attacked

48:41.186 --> 48:43.121
in the locker room
after detention.

48:47.625 --> 48:49.560
Hey, Bruce?

48:51.629 --> 48:54.265
Mr. Kane?

48:54.299 --> 48:56.034
Oh, yes, Parker.

48:56.067 --> 48:58.436
What can I do for you?

48:58.469 --> 49:00.405
Do you know what time it is?

49:02.373 --> 49:04.609
Yeah.
It's, um,

49:04.642 --> 49:08.279
it's a little after 12:00.

49:08.313 --> 49:09.414
Anything else?

49:09.447 --> 49:11.516
Nice watch.

49:11.549 --> 49:13.484
Parker.

49:17.288 --> 49:21.392
You're a smart kid,

49:21.426 --> 49:23.494
and a smart kid would know
that maybe next time,

49:23.528 --> 49:25.096
he won't be lucky enough
to walk away

49:25.130 --> 49:27.065
with just a few bruises.

49:32.570 --> 49:35.406
You have a good rest
of your day, okay, bud?

49:48.053 --> 49:49.720
-What the hell?
-Looks like we know

49:49.754 --> 49:52.723
what grade someone's getting
in English class this semester.

49:52.757 --> 49:54.659
Knock it off, Ashley.

49:54.692 --> 49:56.761
Like you've never hooked up
with a guy you shouldn't--

49:56.794 --> 50:00.031
-Oh, my God.
-Nice going, Bre.

50:00.065 --> 50:01.666
-We thought it was a joke.
-Laura, wait.

50:01.699 --> 50:03.634
I'm--wait, Laura.

50:05.736 --> 50:07.705
-Parker--
-Before you even ask,

50:07.738 --> 50:10.075
I'm not the one that put
the graffiti on your locker.

50:10.108 --> 50:11.276
-I know.
-So tell your boyfriend

50:11.309 --> 50:12.610
I got the message loud
and clear.

50:12.643 --> 50:14.045
I won't mess with you.

50:14.079 --> 50:17.682
You think Bruce did
this to you?

50:17.715 --> 50:21.186
Laura, please,
it just slipped out.

51:02.160 --> 51:05.796
Yeah, I know, but how could
you say something so stupid?

51:05.830 --> 51:07.765
Wow. You know what?
Save it, Bre.

51:11.236 --> 51:13.871
What are you doing here?

51:13.904 --> 51:17.175
Laura, hey. Your mom needed
a last-minute babysitter

51:17.208 --> 51:20.445
when you didn't come home
after school, so I volunteered.

51:20.478 --> 51:21.812
Chloe, don't
you have homework?

51:21.846 --> 51:23.181
Just one more game.

51:23.214 --> 51:24.849
-Chloe.
-Please?

51:24.882 --> 51:27.218
Hey, you heard your sister.

51:27.252 --> 51:29.687
We can play next time
I come over, okay?

51:29.720 --> 51:31.656
Okay.

51:39.330 --> 51:41.299
-Next time?
-Yeah.

51:41.332 --> 51:43.634
I gave up my shifts at the
hospital a couple of days a week

51:43.668 --> 51:46.704
so you wouldn't have to watch
her all the time.

51:46.737 --> 51:49.540
Was that my mom's idea
or was that yours?

51:49.574 --> 51:52.210
Your mom's,
and she gave me a spare key.

51:52.243 --> 51:55.513
So I can get
in whenever I need to.

51:55.546 --> 51:57.615
Is--is everything okay
with Bre?

51:57.648 --> 51:59.617
You seem pretty upset.

51:59.650 --> 52:02.353
I mean, it's just
a stupid fight.

52:02.387 --> 52:04.555
Look, it's--it's been
a really hard day,

52:04.589 --> 52:06.524
and I-I want to be alone.

52:06.557 --> 52:08.426
Oh, yeah. Of course.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.828
Feel better, okay?

52:10.861 --> 52:12.797
She's not worth
getting mad about.

Asshole.

53:32.477 --> 53:34.245
[bell ringing]

53:34.279 --> 53:38.416
Hey, Bre. I was hoping to be
able to talk to you today.

53:38.449 --> 53:40.251
I don't like
being mad at you.

53:40.285 --> 53:43.220
So call me
when you get a chance.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.533
Laura just walked in the door.

53:55.566 --> 53:57.402
I got to call you back.

53:57.435 --> 54:00.538
Hi, Mom. What's up?
[exhales sharply]

54:00.571 --> 54:02.740
Bre was admitted
to the hospital this morning.

54:02.773 --> 54:04.909
She got hit by a car
while jogging.

54:04.942 --> 54:06.844
-Is she okay?
-She will be.

54:06.877 --> 54:10.781
-Do they know who did it?
-It was a hit-and-run.

54:10.815 --> 54:13.551
-That's it.
-What?

54:13.584 --> 54:15.753
Where are you going?

54:15.786 --> 54:19.490
Laura--

54:19.524 --> 54:22.793
-Did you witness the accident?
-No.

54:22.827 --> 54:24.929
But last night, I told him
I was mad at her,

54:24.962 --> 54:26.864
and today, she's in
a hospital bed.

54:26.897 --> 54:29.867
Look, I have to be honest
with you.

54:29.900 --> 54:34.505
You're not giving me
much to go by.

54:34.539 --> 54:36.474
So you're not gonna
do anything?

54:43.514 --> 54:45.450
Laura, hey.

54:49.053 --> 54:51.088
-Did you follow me here?
-What? No.

54:51.121 --> 54:54.091
I'm meeting my parents
down the street for dinner.

54:54.124 --> 54:57.895
And what are you doing
at the police station?

54:57.928 --> 54:59.930
I-I went in to see
if they had any information

54:59.964 --> 55:01.366
about what happened to Bre.

55:01.399 --> 55:02.767
Well, why would you care?

55:02.800 --> 55:04.335
I mean, aren't you
really mad at her?

55:04.369 --> 55:05.736
That's what you said yesterday.

55:05.770 --> 55:07.672
Yeah.
Bruce, we got into a fight.

55:07.705 --> 55:09.740
But she's still
my best friend.

55:09.774 --> 55:11.976
Best friends don't fight,
Laura,

55:12.009 --> 55:13.678
and you shouldn't be
so back-and-forth

55:13.711 --> 55:16.113
on who you keep close to you.

55:16.146 --> 55:17.615
I'm gonna go.

55:17.648 --> 55:20.017
Laura...

55:20.050 --> 55:22.620
what are you doing
tomorrow night?

55:22.653 --> 55:27.057
We should go out.

55:27.091 --> 55:30.027
Alison told me not to ask you.
I just--

55:30.060 --> 55:34.098
Wait. You talk
about me with Alison?

55:34.131 --> 55:35.400
Yeah.

55:35.433 --> 55:37.435
All the time.

55:37.468 --> 55:39.604
She's great with advice.

55:39.637 --> 55:42.006
So what do you say?

55:42.039 --> 55:44.609
Tomorrow is my mom's
late night at the hospital.

55:44.642 --> 55:46.143
So I'm on Chloe duty.

55:46.176 --> 55:48.012
-Well, maybe I could stop by.
-Can I let you know?

55:48.045 --> 55:51.749
Because, um, I still have a lot
of homework to catch up on.

55:51.782 --> 55:54.519

-Yes, you do.

58:20.264 --> 58:22.733
Do you want to begin with
where you were today?

58:22.767 --> 58:24.168
I know you weren't in school.

58:24.201 --> 58:26.070
-Who told you that?
-Bruce.

58:26.103 --> 58:27.938
-Of course.
-He also said you were down

58:27.972 --> 58:30.074
at the police station
last night.

58:30.107 --> 58:32.677
Laura, what is going
on with you?

58:32.710 --> 58:36.714
Mom, Bruce was
in the house last night.

58:36.747 --> 58:37.982
Laura--

58:38.015 --> 58:39.817
You think I'm lying?
Really?

58:39.850 --> 58:41.318
You're gonna trust a stranger
over your own daughter?

58:41.351 --> 58:43.721
Look, I am trying to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

58:43.754 --> 58:45.055
but you're skipping
school again.

58:45.089 --> 58:46.891
You're unreliable
with your sister,

58:46.924 --> 58:48.659
and now you're blaming
some poor guy

58:48.693 --> 58:52.563
for running your friend
off the road?

58:52.597 --> 58:53.998
Does this have to do
with your father?

58:54.031 --> 58:56.233
No. This has nothing
to do with Dad.

58:56.266 --> 59:00.638
I'm--I'm starting
to see why he left you.

59:04.108 --> 59:06.043
Mom.

59:10.347 --> 59:12.282
-Mom.
-Don't.

59:27.297 --> 59:29.734
And my day is complete.

59:29.767 --> 59:32.369
You can't run away
from me now.

59:32.402 --> 59:33.871
Watch me.

59:33.904 --> 59:37.007
Parker.

59:37.041 --> 59:38.976
Parker!

-What the hell, Laura?
-Listen.

59:49.954 --> 59:51.321
I believe you about Bruce.

59:51.355 --> 59:53.257
I think he's the one
that hit Bre too.

59:53.290 --> 59:54.759
Yeah. Well, tell the cops
or something. All right?

59:54.792 --> 59:56.126
I don't want anything
to do with this.

59:56.160 --> 59:59.363
I tried,
and they won't do anything.

59:59.396 --> 01:00:01.031
I'm scared, Parker.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:03.033
He's following me everywhere,

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:06.370
and you're the only person
that I can trust.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:07.872
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:09.907
Look, I know
you're pissed at me.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:13.911
But I swear, I've never had
any feelings for Bruce.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:16.313
I still think
about Nick every day.

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:19.283
You have no idea
how much I cared about him.

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:23.988
What are we supposed to do,
Laura? I mean, we're kids.

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:26.190
I'm gonna talk to his
ex-girlfriend, Alison.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.659
I looked up the family, and I
found her sister on Facebook.

01:00:28.693 --> 01:00:30.928
They live in Stone Bridge.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:34.899
Maybe she can help
talk some sense into him.

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:36.767
All right. Fine.

01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:39.236
I'll pick you up
in the morning.

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:41.806
Thank you.

[doorbell rings]

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:35.960
Hi. I don't know
if you remember me.

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:39.864
Oh, yeah.
Laura, of course. Um, come in.

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:43.333
Thank you.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.869
Um, this is Parker.

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:46.503
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.774
Take a seat.

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:52.276
What brings you guys here?

01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:53.811
Is everything okay with Bruce?

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:56.113
Not in the least.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:58.382
What's wrong?

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.450
I'm just feeling
a little worried.

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:02.787
I was hoping
to talk to Alison.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.756
She's...not here.

01:02:08.092 --> 01:02:10.294
Um, how much has Bruce told you
about Alison?

01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:13.831
Not much. He told me they have
a complicated relationship,

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:16.266
but they talk all the time.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.805
-He said that?
-Yeah.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:24.408
Have you actually
heard him talking to her?

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.944
Yeah. He was on the phone
with her the other day.

01:02:31.015 --> 01:02:32.482
I-I think I should just
call Bruce and get the--

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.518
-No.
-No. Please, don't do that.

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:36.220
He doesn't know that we're here,

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.355
and, um, we--

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:43.227
we really want to help him.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.263
Okay. Then you need to tell me
exactly what's going on.

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:52.436
Did Bruce ever get violent
with Alison?

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.275
No, no.

01:02:58.308 --> 01:03:01.411
Bruce worshipped Alison.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:05.049
He was a little intense,
maybe, but no.

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:06.583
Alison really loved him.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:09.353
Is that her?

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:12.957
Yeah.
That's Ali.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:16.026
Hey, she--
she kind of looks like you.

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:21.498
I guess Bruce has a type.

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:26.103
When is she coming back?

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:34.511
Okay. I don't--I don't--

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:37.882
I don't know
what Bruce has been telling you,

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:41.886
but Alison died almost
four years ago.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.288
-Shut up. How?
-Parker.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.623
No. It's okay.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.159
It was in a car accident.

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:53.263
Bruce took it really hard,
actually.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:57.601
He always blamed himself.

01:03:57.634 --> 01:03:59.136
-We should go.
-Okay.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.971
But is there anything
I can do to help?

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:03.373
I mean, if Bruce is in trouble--

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:05.409
No. Thank you.

01:04:09.013 --> 01:04:11.415
Bye...

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:14.284
I guess.

I can't believe you're
doing this to me tonight.

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:44.281
Of all nights,
you picked tonight.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:47.251
It's just--it's not gonna work
when we graduate.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:49.219
I don't want to end it,
but it's for the best.

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:06.136
We need to move on.

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:08.105
But you're my everything.

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:15.079
Bruce?
Bruce?

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:17.014
Bruce, slow down.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:20.985
I can't live without you.

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:23.220
Bruce, slow down.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:25.189
Bruce, slow down!

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:36.066
Hey, babe. It's Ali.
I miss you.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.936
Call me back, okay?
I want to see you soon.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.546

Bruce, hi. What's up.

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:36.193
Well, Laura said
you were working tonight.

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:38.728
Nope.
First night off in over a week.

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:40.430
-Lucky me.
-Yeah.

01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:44.134
Lucky you.
Um, you know, is she here?

01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:46.736
I've been--I've been trying
to call her phone and--

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.272
No. She left her
phone charging

01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:49.673
in the kitchen
and then forgot it.

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:52.542
Honestly, I have no idea
where she went tonight.

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:57.181
Yeah. I told you not
to ask her out. She--

01:06:57.214 --> 01:07:00.717
Bruce, are you feeling
all right?

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.287
No. I'm not feeling
all right, Sandy!

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.255
Does it look like--

01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:13.430
Maybe you should go home.
Get some rest.

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:16.200
Well, would you be a doll

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:20.270
and just tell her
I stopped by? Okay?

01:07:20.304 --> 01:07:22.639

-Yeah? All right.

Bruce, stop.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:28.372
Did you think you could
just sleep with another guy,

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.673
and I wouldn't care?

01:08:29.706 --> 01:08:30.674
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.408
I saw you with Parker.

I can't believe you would
cheat on me like that.

Parker's just my friend.

But even if he was more,
it's none of your business.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.584
We're not dating, Bruce.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.420
My personal life
is none of your business.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.421
I should've listened
to Alison.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.357
She told me you were trouble.

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.493
Alison's dead, Bruce.

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:50.926
Shut up. Just shut up!

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.830
Shut up! Shut up!
All right? Shut up.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.899
You don't know
anything about her.

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:57.767
You take for granted
everything I've given you.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.403
I saved you.

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.470
I'm in charge
of your life now.

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:03.439

I decide what you do.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.447
Come on.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.416
Come here.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:18.921
I'm taking you out to dinner
tomorrow night,

01:09:18.955 --> 01:09:22.359
and we're gonna have
a good time.

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:25.895
Yeah?
You understand?

01:09:25.929 --> 01:09:27.863
Yeah?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.703

-Sure. What's up?

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:06.836
Ready to go?

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.372
Okay.
Is the sign in the background,

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:12.909
because it's useless
without the sign?

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.878
Bruce,
how's it going out there?

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:16.580
Any signs?

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:19.549
Still no luck finding it,
but I'm not gonna give up.

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:22.652
I know he's out there.

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.254
Okay. Great.
We've got it.

01:10:24.288 --> 01:10:25.889
It's gonna run
on the morning show.

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.558
Your segments have been getting
some really good ratings.

01:10:28.592 --> 01:10:30.294
Would you mind
if I do it again?

I feel like I can do it better.

Thank you.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.700
Did I tell you
I'm still looking for the shark?

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:14.471
No sign of it yet,
but I'm not gonna give up.

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:16.806
You really don't have
to do that.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.775
I'm sure it's long gone
by now.

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:22.078
I'll find it.
The whole town's counting on me.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.047
I have to give them
that headline

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.551
and prove to them that I'm more
than just Richard Kane's son.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:31.821
I've always thought
you were more than that.

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:34.691
I know you did.

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:36.059
From the moment
you looked at me

01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:38.027
when I pulled you out
of the water,

01:11:38.061 --> 01:11:39.996
I knew it.

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:46.470
I thought about what you said

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:48.838
about Bre.

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:51.641
How best friends don't fight.

01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:53.777
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.446
You were absolutely right.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.915
I can't have people
like that in my life.

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:02.652
I'm glad
you're realizing that.

01:12:02.686 --> 01:12:04.488
I just wanted
to say thank you

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:06.623
for what you did to her.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.425
I know you're just
trying to protect me.

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:11.428
Hey...

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:13.863
you're welcome.

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:16.466
If anyone else tries
treating you badly,

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.668
I'll take care of them.

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:20.404
Parker, what do you think
you're doing?

01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:22.372
Back to work.

01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:26.810
-Laura, what's going on?
-Did you get it?

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.612
Yeah.

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:29.913
Were you recording me?

01:12:29.946 --> 01:12:31.648
Stay away from me
and my friends,

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:35.885
and stay the hell
out of my house.

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:37.421
Send me the video.

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:40.390
I'll pick you up
when I'm out.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:47.130
I bet the cops listen
to her now, Mr. Kane.

01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:25.902
I have to go.
Can't stay.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:28.071
I'm not leaving forever,
just for tonight.

Chloe, Chloe!

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.795
Chloe--

01:14:25.829 --> 01:14:27.564
Why are you yelling?

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:29.533
I'm so sorry.

01:14:33.737 --> 01:14:35.672
Okay, Let's get you to bed.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:13.109
Hey.

01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:17.246
Parker, come inside.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:23.019
Parker.

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.292
Parker?

01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:31.260
Yo.

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:37.867
Parker?

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:46.910
What are you--Parker?

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:48.978
Ahh!

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.009
* You made me

01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:23.713
* Love you

01:16:23.747 --> 01:16:26.315
* I do

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:30.754
* I want to do it

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:34.123
* You made me

01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:37.827

01:16:37.861 --> 01:16:41.230
* And all the time
you knew it *

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:45.368
* I guess you always
knew it *

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:51.274
* You made me happy

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:53.376
Surprise.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:57.747
You need to leave, Bruce.

01:16:57.781 --> 01:17:01.651
I've come to forgive you,
Ali.

01:17:01.685 --> 01:17:04.888
I don't care what happened
with Parker.

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:09.125
We can move on from this.

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:12.395
Just don't come any further.

01:17:12.428 --> 01:17:15.799
Oh, baby,

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:19.168
I'm giving you another chance.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:21.805
Just put the knife down.

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:23.873
Okay?

01:17:23.907 --> 01:17:27.977
I know you'd never hurt me.

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:29.946
Ahh!

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:36.219
* That's true yes I do

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:37.821
* Indeed I do

01:17:37.854 --> 01:17:41.290
Get out!

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:44.928
What are you doing?

01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:47.964

Laura,

01:17:53.737 --> 01:17:55.371
it doesn't end here.

Not gonna need this out here.

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:50.253
Nobody's gonna find us.

01:19:58.494 --> 01:20:00.429
What are you doing?

01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:09.472
You don't appreciate
what I've done for you.

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:11.474
I saved your life.

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:14.577
Bruce, I appreciate
that so much.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:17.080
Well, you don't show it!

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:19.048
[whimpering]

01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:59.122
I'm so sorry
about Alison, Bruce.

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:01.190
But I'm not her.

01:21:01.224 --> 01:21:05.128
I know you're not her, Laura.

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:08.965
Alison would never take life
for granted the way you do.

Hey, I told you it
was still here.

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:30.486
Too bad we can't
give them this headline.

01:21:30.519 --> 01:21:32.455
A girl killed
by the same shark

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:34.557
that she was saved from.

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:37.526
The media would eat that up.

01:21:40.263 --> 01:21:43.566
Well, that wasn't
very lady-like.

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:46.335
Don't come any closer.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.211
Ahh!

01:22:32.115 --> 01:22:34.050
I see you've met Alison.

01:22:43.526 --> 01:22:48.231
I knew you wouldn't
leave me, baby.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:51.734
Of course not, Ali.

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:55.671
You're my everything.

01:22:55.704 --> 01:23:00.143
I can't live without you.

*

01:23:36.779 --> 01:23:39.715
You can't hide
on a boat, Laura!

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:57.533
No, no, no. Please, just--

01:23:57.566 --> 01:24:00.269
that's all I have left
of her.

01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:42.305
Laura, hi.

01:25:42.338 --> 01:25:45.841
Oh, Laura--oh, sweetie,
I am so sorry.

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:48.177
I-I should've listened
to you about Bruce.

01:25:48.211 --> 01:25:49.745
I should've trusted you.

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:50.946
I'm sorry about what
I said about Dad.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.848
I'm just so--I'm so sorry.

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:57.686
I know. I know.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.655
I love you.
