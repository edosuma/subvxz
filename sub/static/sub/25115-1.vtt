01:19.122 --> 01:20.341
You know how this is going to end.

02:35.981 --> 02:36.982
You got everything you need?

02:39.028 --> 02:40.701
Yup.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.312
First cam, this
is the live feed cams,

02:42.336 --> 02:44.381
then I'm on to site by site
with the card cams.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.014
I'll just be
here setting up the lab.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.624
I've got a good feeling
about this.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.041
This could be the mission.

02:59.614 --> 03:02.070
That gun's not corporate issue.

03:02.094 --> 03:05.073
You gotta have tools you trust.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.403
As much as you trust yourself.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.645
Everything's synced on my end.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.386
Guess you're my eyes now.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.846
Well, that must be
a comforting thought.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.718
First canvass went as planned.

05:29.764 --> 05:30.678
How are things with you and her?

05:37.511 --> 05:38.662
What do you mean?

05:40.731 --> 05:42.361
I'm just familiar with her profile.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.668
They say she's smart, sure.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.171
I bet she's a little...

05:46.955 --> 05:48.846
obsessive.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.804
What do they say about me?

05:50.828 --> 05:52.458
That you never miss a beat.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.425
Live feed cameras look good.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.513
I was worried
they were gonna give us

06:03.537 --> 06:04.775
the shit equipment again.

06:04.799 --> 06:05.800
But nope.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.239
What's it like out there?

06:12.284 --> 06:13.155
Silent.

06:15.723 --> 06:16.724
Pretty.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.746
Till something
jumps out of the shadows

06:19.770 --> 06:22.183
and rips off one of our limbs.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.663
They said "lack of animal behavior."

06:23.687 --> 06:25.254
Not dangerous.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.737
You remember that line
they fed us in the CRS?

06:30.825 --> 06:32.455
This will make you famous.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.132
Come be part
of the new gold rush.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.875
I wish I did anything
as well as they bullshit.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.749
And yet, here we are.

06:42.924 --> 06:43.925
Yup.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.275
Still chasing the work.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.351
Full cards for processing.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.097
Anything weird happen today?

09:36.750 --> 09:37.794
Nope.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.580
Quiet as a grave out there.

10:06.475 --> 10:07.626
What'd you get?

10:07.650 --> 10:08.608
"Bird in the hand"?

10:10.827 --> 10:12.350
No, "The...

10:12.829 --> 10:14.677
unexamined life..."

10:14.701 --> 10:15.615
What are you doing?

10:17.051 --> 10:18.115
Site three's
on the schedule today.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.357
I know that.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.119
That's where the cult
had its camp.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.361
I've gotta see it.

10:24.145 --> 10:25.494
I don't think so.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.082
They had their tent city

10:29.106 --> 10:30.736
up over that hill there.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.520
And all around this field

10:32.544 --> 10:33.415
are where the experts think
the bodies are buried.

10:34.808 --> 10:35.635
What bodies?

10:36.984 --> 10:38.701
The theory goes
they killed dozens more

10:38.725 --> 10:40.137
we don't know about.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.771
Indigents, homeless...

10:44.644 --> 10:47.492
One of our lawyers went missing
during the trial.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.170
They all might be here.
They call it the killing field.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.912
You know an awful lot about it.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.027
There's video of it, you know.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.487
Some of what they got up to.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.665
Another government guy
showed it to me.

11:06.622 --> 11:07.449
Which guy?

11:08.537 --> 11:09.688
I don't remember his name.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.256
Bleeker or Blecher...

11:12.280 --> 11:14.674
He showed me some clips
from some tapes they recovered.

11:15.544 --> 11:16.545
Including...

11:18.112 --> 11:20.027
highlights from
the Pleasant View Massacre.

11:22.899 --> 11:23.813
When did this happen?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.011
You're jealous.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.708
No.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.536
I just don't believe
he was walking around

11:31.560 --> 11:33.494
with a thrill-kill cult's
home movie in his pocket.

11:33.518 --> 11:34.626
Don't know how he got it,

11:34.650 --> 11:36.062
I just know that he had it,

11:36.086 --> 11:37.063
and he thought
it was something that...

11:37.087 --> 11:38.567
I should see.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.135
The family didn't film anything.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.703
It looked authentic.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.141
It's an urban legend.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.581
What the hell is that?

11:58.848 --> 12:00.217
Someone's been
out here, digging.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.784
Yeah.

12:01.808 --> 12:02.939
And not too long ago.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.073
We should get back to the camp.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.599
Right.

12:12.340 --> 12:15.580
Digging, marking,
human activity.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.519
Someone's been
in site three, do...

12:19.739 --> 12:22.045
What? Why the fuck
didn't you tell us that before?

12:25.092 --> 12:27.026
There was a CSI team out here,
not two months ago,

12:27.050 --> 12:28.462
excavating,

12:28.486 --> 12:30.029
looking for more
of the cult's victims.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.553
And they didn't think
to tell us?

12:32.577 --> 12:33.990
He said, "The information
was not pertinent

12:34.014 --> 12:35.905
to biological analysis."

12:35.929 --> 12:37.863
That sounds like bullshit to me.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.083
Maybe. Or maybe it's innocent.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.848
A lie by accidental omission.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.007
How many indigents
do you think have been...

12:52.641 --> 12:54.643
tortured and murdered
in these woods?

12:55.949 --> 12:57.448
I think, in my heart of hearts,

12:57.472 --> 12:58.362
you can take
their official death score

12:58.386 --> 12:59.604
and double it, at least.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.783
I was young when the family...

13:04.914 --> 13:06.133
did their thing.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.224
Never really took
any interest in it.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.530
Hm.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.033
The prosecuting DA
did a series of lectures

13:17.057 --> 13:18.101
at my school.

13:18.972 --> 13:19.973
I attended all of them.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.106
How could I resist?

13:24.629 --> 13:26.240
When I'm into something,
I can't let it go.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.941
What the cult did
was lure kids in.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.833
They'd hang out
at train stations

13:34.857 --> 13:35.858
or bus depots...

13:37.642 --> 13:39.185
concerts or parks,

13:39.209 --> 13:40.839
on the lookout for runaways,

13:40.863 --> 13:42.972
war vets, anyone down
and out and desperate.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.974
And they'd bring them
back here to the ranch,

13:44.998 --> 13:46.216
indoctrinate them.

13:49.002 --> 13:49.959
Some joined up.

13:50.917 --> 13:51.787
Some left.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.181
And some disappeared.

13:58.707 --> 13:59.708
Hm.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.993
I don't really like
anybody enough to...

14:04.017 --> 14:06.082
ever join anything.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.779
Hm, they felt...

14:07.803 --> 14:09.259
alienated from society.

14:09.283 --> 14:10.913
Isn't that always what it is?

14:10.937 --> 14:12.958
So, they rejected it,
disassociated from it,

14:12.982 --> 14:14.331
and went looking
for something else.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.789
Feeling alienated, I get.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.206
Joining a cult,

14:20.207 --> 14:21.208
I don't.

14:22.731 --> 14:26.058
Hm. It's about survival
and belief, right?

14:26.082 --> 14:29.192
Our brains are built
to be credulous of religion.

14:29.216 --> 14:32.021
And here I was thinking
it was a...

14:32.045 --> 14:33.829
just a bunch of kids
with daddy issues.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.374
Here's one for you.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.376
Does every cult
resemble a family,

14:39.400 --> 14:41.141
or does every family
resemble a cult?

14:42.403 --> 14:43.404
Hm.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.765
So...

15:00.160 --> 15:03.772
It lured a bunch of people
into the woods.

15:04.773 --> 15:05.774
Then what?

15:07.732 --> 15:09.058
They ate a lot of peyote.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.932
They read
the anti-establishment tracts

15:13.956 --> 15:16.413
Father wrote by the bushel,

15:16.437 --> 15:18.004
fucked and danced
to flute music.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.093
Ah, yeah.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.550
Wrote more tracts,

15:23.574 --> 15:24.924
went out and recruited,
rinse and repeat.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.669
And then that shit
went down in Portland.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.759
Pleasant View Massacre.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.262
Three of the four killers joined
the family the previous year.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.243
Probational members,

15:41.070 --> 15:42.115
proving themselves.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.857
No one thought
they were violent.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.949
Or maybe they weren't,
and then something changed.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.474
I wish I knew.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.781
History is so full of shadow.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.092
I shudder to think
what this land has witnessed.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.921
Oh, it gives me the chills.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.188
Okay.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.199
Good for you.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.224
What do you think our bosses

20:06.248 --> 20:07.380
are hoping to find out here?

20:07.728 --> 20:08.990
Really?

20:14.256 --> 20:16.191
A, uh...

20:16.215 --> 20:18.541
previously uncharacterized
element,

20:18.565 --> 20:21.152
genetic-environmental
or otherwise,

20:21.176 --> 20:23.023
one that might change
the way we view

20:23.047 --> 20:24.484
our relationship
to the natural world.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.009
That's what
you're hoping to find.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.075
Yeah.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.319
On that matter, the company
and I are aligned.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.343
But...

20:38.367 --> 20:41.022
How do they profit on whatever
is going on out here?

20:41.849 --> 20:43.392
Maybe they won't.

20:43.416 --> 20:44.417
Yeah, maybe.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.787
But they'll definitely try.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.485
For better or for worse.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.598
Distrust is really
your default setting, isn't it?

20:55.515 --> 20:56.777
Only when it comes to people.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.277
Please.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.844
You give nature
too much respect.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.411
The natural world
is far more ruthless,

21:02.435 --> 21:04.413
far less altruistic
than culture.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.285
Animals don't torture.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.592
They don't lie,
they don't scheme.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.531
A starving wolf just attacks.

21:13.794 --> 21:14.858
Well, if you're hoping
to disappoint

21:14.882 --> 21:16.599
our corporate overlords...

21:16.623 --> 21:18.122
I've got good news.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.495
Ain't no answers
in these samples.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.432
So, what's next?

21:23.456 --> 21:25.022
I dunno. We keep looking.

22:34.309 --> 22:36.442
Card 27 B, stroke 6.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.096
Camera triggered.

22:43.536 --> 22:44.537
No visual.

22:47.322 --> 22:49.193
Camera 207, site 9.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.652
Same thing.
Heat detection activated.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.698
Nothing there.

22:55.722 --> 22:57.874
Camera malfunction, must be.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.266
The same malfunction
across all the cameras?

22:59.290 --> 23:01.399
No, it's like they're...

23:01.423 --> 23:03.401
looking for something
that's not there.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.446
Or they're seeing something

23:04.470 --> 23:05.296
that we're not.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.257
I'm gonna move on
to the site three cameras.

23:10.824 --> 23:11.888
Nothing.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.784
Nothing.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.765
We just lost all video.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.208
Hilarious. Will you help me?

24:08.577 --> 24:09.622
You dreamed this would happen.

24:11.319 --> 24:12.644
That the video monitors
were on the fritz,

24:12.668 --> 24:14.298
that you fucked 'em up somehow.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.734
What'd I do?
Pour liquor under them?

24:15.758 --> 24:16.803
What?

24:17.760 --> 24:19.564
Like the...

24:19.588 --> 24:21.087
T. Billings thing.

24:21.111 --> 24:22.480
The first Dead Zone Mission?

24:22.504 --> 24:23.612
What did you hear happened?

24:23.636 --> 24:24.811
The team was...

24:25.986 --> 24:27.572
partying at the site one night,

24:27.596 --> 24:29.618
and T. Billings
got a little crazy

24:29.642 --> 24:31.620
and dumped a...

24:31.644 --> 24:34.405
full glass of scotch
on some circuitry.

24:34.429 --> 24:37.974
Started an electrical fire
and "fwoom!"

24:37.998 --> 24:40.498
The whole site went
up like an arctic torch.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.979
They all froze pretty fast.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.352
Nobody left to tell the tale.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.682
I met him once, Billings,

24:50.706 --> 24:52.578
at one of Doctor Ryoko's
cocktail parties.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.905
I don't get invited to those.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.365
A people person like you?

24:58.584 --> 24:59.672
Shocking.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.522
Doctor Ryoko loved him.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.697
Toshi collects guys like that.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.656
Toshi?

25:07.680 --> 25:09.614
First name basis, cozy.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.617
What, do you got a key
to the château, too?

25:12.641 --> 25:14.382
No wonder you're on the fast track.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.342
Jealous?

25:21.041 --> 25:22.390
Oh, they're back.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.021
It's not my work.

25:25.045 --> 25:25.698
Must be something fidgety
in the air.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.354
Feed one's still out.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.643
I've heard knocking on the hatch.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.862
Two nights this week.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.061
It's your imagination.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.280
I think it's you.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.631
Messing with my head.

25:46.762 --> 25:47.913
Did you check the feed?

25:47.937 --> 25:48.938
Of course.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.528
Did you see me on there, knocking?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.268
No. But you know
the angle of the camera.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.467
You could make it to the door
without it seeing.

25:59.775 --> 26:00.776
Here.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.387
Place this one, too.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.565
Anywhere you want. That way,
I can't sneak up on you.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.576
Why didn't you tell me before?

26:18.838 --> 26:19.969
About the knocking?

26:21.797 --> 26:23.886
I have to tell you everything
that happens to me?

28:02.898 --> 28:04.552
Mm-hm.

29:07.920 --> 29:08.921
Hilarious.

29:14.274 --> 29:16.058
Goddammit, let me in!

29:18.147 --> 29:19.540
I know you can see me.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.242
Okay.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.311
I rigged the den...

29:53.313 --> 29:55.054
way up, past site three.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.320
No sign of a pack, but, uh...

30:02.191 --> 30:05.586
it's ripe for habitation.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.068
Maybe we'll get lucky.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.832
I had something
happen to me today.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.531
I went out,

30:18.555 --> 30:20.055
figured I'd do
a little collection myself.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.621
You're not supposed to do that.

30:21.645 --> 30:24.059
Yeah, well, I got tired
of the den mother role.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.171
Figured it wouldn't hurt.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.565
So, I went off down
into the south sector...

30:30.089 --> 30:32.981
and found a huge nest
of these guys in the trees.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.725
Cecidostiba semifascia

30:38.749 --> 30:40.815
crawling everywhere.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.711
In the trees, on the bushes,
all over the ground.

30:45.713 --> 30:48.039
Scores of them
were clumping together

30:48.063 --> 30:50.109
and falling to the ground
like ripe apples.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.046
I've checked every case study
on record.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.855
None of them
have activity like this.

31:00.684 --> 31:01.685
It got weirder.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.865
At first, I was repulsed.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.129
The larvae,
moving together like that.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.762
Then I started taking samples.

31:15.786 --> 31:18.026
Put my hands right in there.
They didn't flinch.

31:18.050 --> 31:20.115
They crawled up on me.
Up my arms.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.662
Tried to get under my shirt.

31:23.490 --> 31:25.666
I don't know why
I wasn't stung to death.

31:26.797 --> 31:27.886
There were so many of them.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.065
I've never seen
anything like it.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.873
Never read any case study
where behavior like that

31:38.897 --> 31:40.376
is even mentioned
as a possibility.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.752
Insect samples coming your way.

31:48.776 --> 31:51.059
I think you're going
to find them mighty special.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.364
Hope so.

31:52.388 --> 31:54.366
Still haven't seen shit.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.305
Five guys here are
recommending a deeper canvass.

31:56.958 --> 31:57.872
Great.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.329
Great.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.244
Hey.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.791
You're not pissed about
the CSI thing, are you?

32:05.140 --> 32:06.901
Pissed that you didn't give us
all the facts?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.337
No, not at all.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.514
You know,

32:11.538 --> 32:12.776
if there's no trust
between you and me,

32:12.800 --> 32:14.473
the work might suffer.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.412
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm all about the work.

34:30.632 --> 34:31.567
I want to start by eliminating

34:31.591 --> 34:32.853
the obvious hypothesis.

34:33.592 --> 34:35.266
Let's get water and soil samples

34:35.290 --> 34:37.399
all the way back
from sites 12 and 13.

34:37.422 --> 34:39.400
Maybe there's a dump site
on the land.

34:39.425 --> 34:41.228
Maybe hunters
contaminated the water.

34:41.253 --> 34:45.014
I'm gonna be gone overnight.

34:45.039 --> 34:46.040
So?

34:47.433 --> 34:48.824
I can take care of myself.

36:15.347 --> 36:16.435
Hello.

36:28.316 --> 36:29.187
Hello?

37:25.199 --> 37:27.221
Where were you?

37:27.245 --> 37:28.613
Out in site three.
Researching.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.030
Great.

37:31.597 --> 37:33.120
Next time, leave a note.

37:34.295 --> 37:35.253
Someone said my name.

37:37.603 --> 37:40.277
It sounded close,
like right behind the bushes.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.061
Oh.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.673
If you thought the bushes
were talking to you,

37:44.697 --> 37:47.003
maybe we should
analyze the lemonade.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.268
I swear somebody
stage-whispered my name.

37:54.533 --> 37:55.751
Check the tree line?

37:58.145 --> 37:59.253
Nothing there.

38:03.629 --> 38:06.303
It's a phantom voice.

38:06.327 --> 38:09.219
Your subconscious
calling out for attention.

38:09.243 --> 38:12.178
Happened to me a lot
when I used to get rummy,

38:12.202 --> 38:13.702
scrunched into a blind.

38:13.726 --> 38:14.703
Get tired enough,
you hear and see things

38:14.727 --> 38:15.791
that aren't there.

38:15.815 --> 38:16.816
I'm not tired.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.341
The mind gets bored.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.126
It plays games. Acts out.

38:25.215 --> 38:26.173
Yeah. Maybe.

38:27.653 --> 38:29.413
It's just...

38:29.437 --> 38:30.830
Then I had this dream.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.722
Was your mother there?

38:33.746 --> 38:34.834
I'm not joking.

38:36.357 --> 38:37.837
It was sunset in the dream.

38:39.186 --> 38:41.536
And this hideous redness
covered everything.

38:42.842 --> 38:44.191
Made my eyes hurt.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.543
Light seeped in from the sky,
and through cracks in the earth

38:50.502 --> 38:52.112
until I couldn't see
anything, but...

38:53.374 --> 38:55.507
shadows and blurry figures of...

38:58.292 --> 38:59.206
People appeared.

39:00.686 --> 39:01.774
They gathered around me.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.125
Maybe they weren't human.

39:08.868 --> 39:11.368
So, how did this dream end?

39:11.392 --> 39:13.394
That's the thing.
I don't know if it ever did.

39:16.223 --> 39:17.374
Everything just went black.

39:50.953 --> 39:52.888
Psst.

39:52.912 --> 39:53.521
I wasn't being straight
with you earlier.

39:55.349 --> 39:56.481
I did hear a voice.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.503
Whoever it was, whatever it was,

39:59.527 --> 40:00.983
it whispered my name.

40:01.007 --> 40:02.356
But that's not all it did.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.314
It asked where you were.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.597
"Where's your friend?

40:06.621 --> 40:07.579
Where's your friend?

40:08.580 --> 40:09.494
Where's your friend?"

40:11.713 --> 40:13.193
Then... Then it was gone.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.588
And there was nothing
behind the tree.

43:27.996 --> 43:29.389
What's with the new remote feed?

43:30.999 --> 43:33.480
Tell me again about
the voice you heard.

43:35.525 --> 43:36.788
So you can make fun of me more?

43:38.964 --> 43:40.942
You heard it since then?

43:40.966 --> 43:42.054
I don't think so.

43:45.710 --> 43:46.798
What about the knocking?

43:48.234 --> 43:49.452
No.

43:51.541 --> 43:53.563
Something spooked you,
didn't it?

43:53.587 --> 43:55.304
I'm just thinking,

43:55.328 --> 43:56.261
it's not like they caught
every single nut case

43:56.285 --> 43:57.872
that followed the cult.

43:57.896 --> 43:59.003
They caught the
ones that mattered.

43:59.027 --> 44:00.657
The rest of them fled.

44:00.681 --> 44:02.640
Just drifting back
to regular old life.

44:05.555 --> 44:06.818
Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

44:07.819 --> 44:08.733
What'd you see out there?

44:10.082 --> 44:11.146
Nothing.

45:13.232 --> 45:15.060
Let me touch your face.

47:49.823 --> 47:51.235
I found this.

47:51.259 --> 47:52.608
Out past site three.

47:57.831 --> 47:58.701
It's old.

48:00.181 --> 48:01.704
In 19th century old.

48:04.490 --> 48:06.468
There were people here
before the cult.

48:06.492 --> 48:07.991
Yeah.

48:08.015 --> 48:09.147
And I think I know
where they were living.

48:18.025 --> 48:21.744
It's obviously a farm
or ranch of some kind.

48:21.768 --> 48:24.747
The wall marks some kind
of corral. Maybe sheep.

48:24.771 --> 48:26.401
This must be
the original settlement.

48:26.425 --> 48:27.643
It's possible.

48:30.124 --> 48:31.169
This area here...

48:32.257 --> 48:33.388
There's something...

48:35.738 --> 48:36.914
different about it.

49:02.200 --> 49:03.331
This is bone.

49:11.165 --> 49:12.123
It's all bone.

49:14.473 --> 49:16.277
There must be dozens
of bodies buried there.

49:16.301 --> 49:19.062
I've got samples here
from men, women, and children.

49:19.086 --> 49:20.977
I thought we were here
investigating new phenomena.

49:21.001 --> 49:22.960
Yeah, yeah, me too.

49:24.874 --> 49:26.287
How does this relate
to the animal behavior

49:26.311 --> 49:27.703
and how does that relate
to the cult?

49:29.792 --> 49:30.968
It doesn't seem like
a coincidence.

49:32.839 --> 49:35.122
I mean, it can't be
a coincidence, right?

49:35.146 --> 49:36.495
There must be something there.

49:37.496 --> 49:38.801
Hm?

49:40.325 --> 49:41.476
Hello?

49:41.500 --> 49:43.565
Sorry. What?

49:43.589 --> 49:44.827
I said, they want the bone samples

49:44.851 --> 49:46.785
back at the main lab.

49:46.809 --> 49:48.918
Anomaly like that
has got their interest.

49:48.942 --> 49:51.486
And I'm supposed to believe
that you guys had no idea

49:51.510 --> 49:53.575
about the original settlement.

49:53.599 --> 49:55.533
You can believe whatever you want.

49:55.557 --> 49:56.839
Our records are what
the government gave us

49:56.863 --> 49:58.406
when we bought the land.

49:58.430 --> 49:59.146
We're on the same side
here, okay?

49:59.170 --> 50:00.998
Right. Okay.

50:02.173 --> 50:03.585
Anything else?

50:03.609 --> 50:05.282
Yeah. Just one thing...

50:05.306 --> 50:06.177
Did you fuck her yet?

50:08.179 --> 50:09.330
I'm not gonna answer that.

50:12.270 --> 50:13.184
What'd he say?

50:15.099 --> 50:17.903
He says he is going
to send someone for samples.

50:17.927 --> 50:19.538
But he thinks it could be
something, right?

50:20.365 --> 50:21.409
Yeah.

50:22.280 --> 50:23.300
Yeah, he does.

50:23.324 --> 50:24.369
Good.

50:25.631 --> 50:27.024
We might have something here.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.276
What's going on
in the rest of the world?

51:26.300 --> 51:29.521
The decline of civilization
continues apace.

51:30.957 --> 51:32.089
Human remains, right?

51:34.003 --> 51:35.092
Among other things.

51:40.009 --> 51:41.098
The rest of your stuff
is in here.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.472
The last team dug those, too.

51:48.496 --> 51:50.063
CSI team?
Yeah.

51:51.020 --> 51:52.413
Poor bastards.

51:54.502 --> 51:55.982
What'd you mean "poor bastards"?

52:00.117 --> 52:02.704
Well, I heard the lead
on the last team went nuts.

52:02.728 --> 52:04.532
Started disappearing
at odd times.

52:04.556 --> 52:06.079
Seeing things
that weren't there.

52:07.994 --> 52:09.928
Then one night,
one of the guys woke up

52:09.952 --> 52:11.998
and Bart was right
on top of him.

52:12.651 --> 52:14.194
Slashing his face to ribbons.

52:14.218 --> 52:15.760
Jesus.

52:15.784 --> 52:17.308
Took the other two
just to pull him off.

52:18.961 --> 52:20.287
I hear they got him locked

52:20.311 --> 52:22.617
in one of the labs
for observation.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.316
Weird fucking story, huh?

52:38.111 --> 52:39.417
I'm going on card retrieval.

52:48.730 --> 52:49.949
What are you doing?

52:52.169 --> 52:54.954
Standing around,
thinking about death.

52:57.043 --> 52:59.326
I meant today. For work.

52:59.350 --> 53:00.612
I'm waiting on the lab.

53:04.355 --> 53:06.289
Nothing else I can do, really,

53:06.313 --> 53:09.684
except stare at the same data,
over and over again.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.710
Hoping to see something in it.

54:30.136 --> 54:31.287
What have you been doing in here?

54:31.311 --> 54:32.984
It's a mess.

54:33.008 --> 54:34.532
"Physical evidence
suggests no link."

54:37.535 --> 54:38.599
What?

54:38.623 --> 54:40.146
That's the full report.

54:45.325 --> 54:47.129
"Dating suggests the deaths occurred

54:47.153 --> 54:50.306
some 200 years ago
and were of a violent nature.

54:50.330 --> 54:51.786
Some show signs
of blunt force trauma,

54:51.810 --> 54:53.290
others no signs of violence."

54:58.512 --> 55:00.621
"A history of violence is common
in newly settled territories.

55:00.645 --> 55:02.362
As such,

55:02.386 --> 55:05.147
the presence of corpses
does not suggest a causal link.

55:05.171 --> 55:06.627
Return focus to

55:06.651 --> 55:07.391
animal behavior."
Animal behavior.

55:08.609 --> 55:10.500
So we found nothing.

55:10.524 --> 55:12.633
Maybe there's some connection
between past and present.

55:12.657 --> 55:14.417
Maybe it's genetics.
Maybe it's chemistry.

55:14.441 --> 55:15.810
Maybe it's aliens,
maybe it's ghosts.

55:15.834 --> 55:17.139
Maybe it's none of that shit.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.643
What are you doing?

55:22.667 --> 55:24.601
There's never just one.

55:24.625 --> 55:26.148
I'm not getting drunk
with you again.

55:28.107 --> 55:29.171
What are you gonna do instead?

55:29.195 --> 55:30.152
Sit in here and jerk off?

55:30.936 --> 55:32.111
I don't think so.

55:35.375 --> 55:36.202
Ah.

55:37.769 --> 55:39.510
My parents never approved
of my career.

55:40.902 --> 55:43.209
Biology, genetics,
field research.

55:44.863 --> 55:46.231
I might as well told them

55:46.255 --> 55:47.450
I was gonna sell my body
on the streets.

55:49.433 --> 55:52.194
You really want to talk
about your parents right now?

55:52.218 --> 55:53.761
When I feel like a failure,

55:53.785 --> 55:54.394
that's exactly what I
wanna talk about.

56:01.445 --> 56:03.229
You know, my mom died last year.

56:04.709 --> 56:07.209
I'm sorry.

56:07.233 --> 56:08.234
I never liked her, anyway.

56:15.415 --> 56:17.393
The woman my dad married is worse.

56:17.417 --> 56:18.244
Drunken witch.

56:21.378 --> 56:22.877
My dad's fat as a cow,

56:22.901 --> 56:24.468
and farts his way
through the news...

56:26.644 --> 56:28.385
and tournament poker
16 hours a day.

56:30.909 --> 56:32.563
They've all been
like strangers to me.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.218
It's miserable.

56:37.568 --> 56:39.396
It's miserable to feel so alone.

56:47.360 --> 56:49.275
My father was a woodsman.

56:52.583 --> 56:54.759
After Mom died, he...

56:56.413 --> 56:58.347
disappeared into
the Olympic National Forest

56:58.371 --> 57:00.591
with a backpack and a dog.

57:02.593 --> 57:04.203
We never found his body.

57:08.947 --> 57:10.315
I bet he thought he was doing

57:10.339 --> 57:12.274
what a real man
is supposed to do.

57:12.298 --> 57:13.778
Going into the wilderness
to die.

57:17.869 --> 57:19.392
So I'm not even sure
if that's true.

57:24.919 --> 57:28.769
The world is large
and unknowable.

57:34.494 --> 57:35.930
No one ever
really knows anything.

58:41.648 --> 58:42.867
Site six today, right?

58:45.130 --> 58:46.348
Yeah.

58:48.394 --> 58:49.526
Yeah, that's right.

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:34.838
I found this.

01:02:37.928 --> 01:02:39.253
Is it real?

01:02:39.277 --> 01:02:40.582
Pretty sure.

01:02:42.367 --> 01:02:43.498
Where did it come from?

01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:47.217
I found a cave, west of here.

01:02:47.241 --> 01:02:49.567
Not so much a cave, really.

01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:51.550
More like a deep,
vertical crevice.

01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:54.747
I think they held
ceremonies there.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.313
"They"?

01:02:56.337 --> 01:02:57.619
You know who I'm talking about.

01:02:57.643 --> 01:02:59.012
The fuckers left symbols
on the walls

01:02:59.036 --> 01:03:00.883
in chalk and paint.

01:03:00.907 --> 01:03:04.234
This was just sitting there,
lying in the dirt, broken.

01:03:04.258 --> 01:03:06.652
Chiseled from a curtain
of glaciated rock.

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:09.587
That's got to
weigh 50 kilos at least,

01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:11.198
how did you get it back here?

01:03:11.222 --> 01:03:12.155
Hm, you aren't
the only one who knows

01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:13.659
how to build a travois.

01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:17.726
It was dark down there.

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:19.902
But it looked like
there was something big

01:03:19.926 --> 01:03:21.667
fossilized in the cave wall.

01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:25.976
I think this came from
whatever that was.

01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:52.176
What?

01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:54.656
Uh...

01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:57.355
What...

01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:10.257
Ow!

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:28.272
Hello?

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.774
Hello?

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.470
I see the rock.

01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:18.496
There are no rock formations
on the land.

01:06:19.366 --> 01:06:20.498
Not anywhere.

01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:23.129
I don't get it.

01:06:23.153 --> 01:06:25.155
That must be wrong.
Something must be off.

01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:28.351
Must be something off.

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:29.986
I don't get it. Must be wrong.

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:32.466
Yeah, something's off.

01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:29.001
Oh, the places we'll go.

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:41.274
Uh, what?

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:49.500
Where are you?

01:07:55.332 --> 01:07:57.092
Site three.

01:07:57.116 --> 01:07:58.920
What are you doing there?

01:07:58.944 --> 01:08:00.250
Well, it's a nice place to...

01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:04.926
build a house, raise some kids.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:06.343
Yeah, children
would love it out there.

01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:09.452
Where were you this morning?

01:08:09.476 --> 01:08:11.280
Oh, you know...

01:08:11.304 --> 01:08:12.566
out chasing the work.

01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:14.090
Yeah.

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:21.334
So, why did you call?

01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:22.533
Is everything okay?

01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:25.144
You called me.

01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:32.736
I did?

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.997
I finally have
work to do over here.

01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:35.130
Why would I call you?

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:37.089
You're ornery today.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.265
I'm not ornery, I'm busy.

01:08:39.288 --> 01:08:41.117
Not just you playing boy scout
out here anymore.

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:42.988
Right.

01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:48.361
I'm tramping the woods...

01:08:48.385 --> 01:08:51.537
and you're barefoot
and pregnant in the kitchen.

01:08:51.562 --> 01:08:53.171
You're cooking for
yourself tonight, honey.

01:08:57.698 --> 01:08:59.569
So, you really don't have
anything to say?

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:05.377
You called me.

01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:06.205
All right, then
I'm hanging up, too.

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:38.062
I don't understand.

01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:39.846
Hm.

01:09:39.871 --> 01:09:41.022
I don't understand.
Me neither.

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:42.415
Yeah, me neither.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:44.286
Maybe it's a signpost.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:46.549
A guide pointing
the way toward...

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:48.682
Maybe it's a signpost.
I don't understand.

01:09:48.706 --> 01:09:50.011
I told you why.
Yeah, me neither.

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:54.209
Maybe it's a signpost.

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:56.168
A guide...
Towards what?

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.518
Pointing the way
towards something.

01:09:58.542 --> 01:09:59.649
When I saw the horn kinda...
Towards what?

01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:01.912
Peeking out of the rocks...

01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:03.305
I don't know.
When I first saw the horn...

01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:05.002
peeking out of the rocks...

01:10:05.026 --> 01:10:06.352
this feeling...
I saw the horn coming...

01:10:06.376 --> 01:10:07.246
peeking out of the rocks.

01:10:10.075 --> 01:10:11.661
I felt this...

01:10:11.685 --> 01:10:13.402
this feeling, this shock.

01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:15.341
Hit me.

01:14:18.366 --> 01:14:20.325
Start getting laid,
go back to the Stone Age.

01:14:27.332 --> 01:14:28.855
Why are you letting
all the bugs in?

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:32.337
I don't...

01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:35.340
I don't know.

01:14:53.837 --> 01:14:56.013
What the fuck?

01:15:13.552 --> 01:15:15.380
Did you hear knocking
on the module last night?

01:15:16.599 --> 01:15:17.469
No.

01:15:24.128 --> 01:15:25.390
Are you okay?

01:15:31.657 --> 01:15:32.702
Where did this come from?

01:15:33.703 --> 01:15:35.313
Cave in the western sector.

01:15:36.444 --> 01:15:37.924
There aren't any caves
in the western sector.

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:40.536
There aren't?
No.

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:44.646
I guess that's not
where I found it.

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:46.411
Stop fucking lying to me!

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:55.962
I found it in the bushes.
Where?

01:15:55.986 --> 01:15:57.378
Near an anthill
I've been studying.

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:03.080
Canids dug it up, probably.

01:19:02.955 --> 01:19:05.697
Where's your friend?

01:19:09.092 --> 01:19:10.093
Where's your friend?

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:14.662
Where's your friend?

01:19:18.275 --> 01:19:19.276
Where's your friend?

01:19:21.104 --> 01:19:21.974
Where's your friend?

01:19:23.628 --> 01:19:24.629
Where's your friend?

01:19:26.152 --> 01:19:27.284
Where's your friend?

01:19:29.068 --> 01:19:29.939
Where's your friend?

01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:32.961
Where's your friend?

01:19:32.985 --> 01:19:33.812
What?

01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:37.903
I didn't say anything.

01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:54.702
Where were you this morning?

01:19:56.095 --> 01:19:58.030
Uh, nowhere.

01:19:58.054 --> 01:19:59.969
I was right here,
working through newest data.

01:20:02.754 --> 01:20:03.624
Right.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:12.827
I noticed you're not following

01:20:12.851 --> 01:20:13.678
the schedule anymore.

01:20:17.247 --> 01:20:19.138
Yes, my partner.
She's not handling the stress.

01:20:19.162 --> 01:20:20.661
She's lying, she's obfuscating.

01:20:20.685 --> 01:20:21.793
Sounds to us like

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.316
you're not handling things well,

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:25.318
your reports of the disaster.

01:20:25.342 --> 01:20:26.212
So there's nothing
that seemed wrong.

01:20:26.952 --> 01:20:28.147
Screw you.

01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:30.149
My guts says it's dangerous,

01:20:30.173 --> 01:20:32.151
I want Evac now!

01:20:32.175 --> 01:20:34.980
Dangerous?
We don't see any danger.

01:20:35.004 --> 01:20:37.765
Keith, you just need
a little bit more sleep.

01:20:37.789 --> 01:20:39.201
Hello? You hear me?

01:20:39.225 --> 01:20:40.507
Yes, we hear you.

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:41.987
We can't authorize Evac.

01:20:42.011 --> 01:20:43.684
What... the hell you can't!

01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:45.860
We cannot. It's not possible.

01:20:45.884 --> 01:20:47.296
All right.
Then, I'm walking out.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.908
Just relax. Have a drink.

01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:51.716
Fuck you.

01:20:56.677 --> 01:20:57.722
Hm.

01:21:42.462 --> 01:21:43.420
What the fuck?

01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:21.779
Come on, come on, come on.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:37.882
Fuck!

01:25:15.545 --> 01:25:17.044
Hello...

01:25:22.595 --> 01:25:23.659
Hello...

01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:09.294
You have my eyes.

01:28:13.766 --> 01:28:15.115
That bitch.

01:28:17.422 --> 01:28:19.555
That bitch!

01:29:29.712 --> 01:29:30.756
Look at you.

01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:32.802
You're weak as a kitten.

01:29:35.239 --> 01:29:37.589
Don't worry about me.
I'm fit as a farmhand.

01:29:44.944 --> 01:29:46.250
How long?

01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:48.731
Excuse me?

01:29:52.735 --> 01:29:54.563
How long have you been
poisoning me?

01:29:57.566 --> 01:29:59.785
I'm not poisoning you, honey.

01:30:01.744 --> 01:30:02.788
It's all in your head.

01:30:04.921 --> 01:30:06.313
There's something in my water.

01:30:12.842 --> 01:30:14.234
You must be tired.

01:30:15.627 --> 01:30:17.194
That makes the mind play tricks.

01:30:17.977 --> 01:30:19.196
Isn't that right?

01:30:21.851 --> 01:30:22.895
No.

01:30:25.028 --> 01:30:26.290
Not like this.

01:30:28.335 --> 01:30:29.598
You've done something.

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:33.297
What happened?

01:30:37.606 --> 01:30:38.781
It's not worth this.

01:30:42.611 --> 01:30:44.177
You have no idea what this is.

01:32:40.424 --> 01:32:43.490
Open the door.
I know everything.

01:32:43.514 --> 01:32:45.385
Open the door.
Unlock the door.

01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:50.715
Open the door.

01:32:50.739 --> 01:32:52.305
We can help you.

01:32:53.655 --> 01:32:54.806
Go to hell.

01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:55.763
We have your eyes.

01:32:55.787 --> 01:32:57.417
Let us see you.

01:32:57.441 --> 01:32:58.549
Go to hell!

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:00.115
They're all the same.

01:33:00.139 --> 01:33:01.726
The key.
Let us help.

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:03.162
Get the fuck away!

01:33:03.186 --> 01:33:05.362
There is trust between us.

01:33:06.450 --> 01:33:08.452
Get the fuck away!

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:19.744
Help me.

01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:26.470
Help.
