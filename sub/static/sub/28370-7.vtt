00:17.234 --> 00:19.062

You should probably be trying
to figure out

00:20.324 --> 00:22.065
who killed that guy
in the flower shop.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.589
I recognize that guy's voice.
I can't place it,

I would know it.

You can't keep doing things

00:39.952 --> 00:41.084
He's the one who killed

00:41.128 --> 00:42.520

00:44.696 --> 00:46.307

the police station

for Evan's murder.

for Darnell. So do I.

You can't just...
turn this guy in

without talking to him first.

for drug dealers?

I don't need to explain
myself to you, babe.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.938
Well, if it isn't
the happy couple.

01:08.981 --> 01:12.942
To what do I owe this pleasure?

01:12.985 --> 01:15.640
[clears throat]
Max is forcing me

01:15.684 --> 01:18.382
to tell you who killed
the flower shop guy.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.080
The dude who owns
Clover Flora.

01:20.123 --> 01:22.343
Right. The yuppie drug front.Yes.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.301
Okay, I'll bite.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.607
Who was it?

01:25.650 --> 01:27.522
Wesley.

01:27.565 --> 01:28.958
What?

01:29.001 --> 01:31.178
My Wesley?He robbed him,

01:31.221 --> 01:32.353
and then he shot him.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.789
How would you know that?

01:33.832 --> 01:36.008
Because I was there.
I was hiding in the bathroom,

01:36.052 --> 01:38.359
and I recognized his voice.All right.

01:38.402 --> 01:39.708
So what if he did?

01:41.013 --> 01:43.407
I think Wesley
also killed Tyson.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.322
Nah.

01:45.366 --> 01:48.543
Even that punk knows
not to mess with my family.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.153
They're obviously connected.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.981
We just don't know how.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.287
Well...

01:53.330 --> 01:55.593
let's figure it out.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.988
[clears throat]

01:59.031 --> 02:01.164
This is Tyson.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.340
Oh, my God.Just...

02:04.776 --> 02:07.127
Wesley.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.433
Okay?

02:09.477 --> 02:11.174
This is you, Darnell.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.480
Take a look.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.441
Autopsy report says that there
were contusions on his throat.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.313
So he was strangled
and shot in the forehead?

02:19.356 --> 02:21.750
Yeah, but he wasn't shot
until after Murphy found him.

02:21.793 --> 02:24.318
She said there was
no wound, remember?

02:24.361 --> 02:26.842
Right. So Tyson
is strangled,

02:26.885 --> 02:28.191
rendering him unconscious.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.366
That's when Murphy finds him.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.586
Then she leaves to call us.Which is when

02:31.629 --> 02:33.370
the killer must have
taken him away.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.372
And there was no blood left
in the alley,

02:35.416 --> 02:39.376
so we have to assume
that he was shot somewhere else.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.204
But why move him?

02:41.248 --> 02:42.597
Why not just leave him there?

02:42.640 --> 02:44.338
It could look like
a routine drug deal gone wrong.

02:44.381 --> 02:47.602
Maybe because
Murphy showed up.

02:47.645 --> 02:50.561
MURPHY: Okay, so Tyson
has been working for you

02:50.605 --> 02:52.476
for two years, yes?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.261
Yeah.Okay, and so has Wesley.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.088
And-and...

02:56.132 --> 02:57.699
Sorry, hang on.
Which one is Wesley again?

02:57.742 --> 02:58.961
Mustard.Mustard.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.354
Okay, so, Wes...No, that's syrup.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.225
And syrup is me, apparently.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.358
Hey. This is
Wesley right here.So...

03:04.401 --> 03:06.708
So, Wesley finds out
that Tyson has been working

03:06.751 --> 03:08.579
for the flower shop guy
behind everyone's back,

03:08.623 --> 03:11.800
kills him for being a traitor
or whatever. I buy that.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.628
Don't you buy that, D?No.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.499
[scoffs] This is solid.

03:15.543 --> 03:16.674
Not solid enough.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.372
But...

03:18.415 --> 03:20.287
I may have something else.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.114
So, let's break
this down.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.899
Murphy found Tyson

03:23.942 --> 03:26.641
in the alley,
presumably alive, at 9:30.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.425
This has avocado.
I said no avocado.

03:28.469 --> 03:31.123
It takes approximately
two hours during rush hour

03:31.167 --> 03:33.735
to get from Madison
into the city.

03:33.778 --> 03:37.652
Tyson's dad's doorbell app
shows him leaving at 6:30.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.915
Which puts him back here
at 8:30 at the earliest.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.264
Still leaves an hour
unaccounted for.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.397
Whoever he saw during that hour

03:43.440 --> 03:45.442
could be the person
that killed him.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.444
A few days
before Tyson got shot,

03:47.488 --> 03:50.317
Wesley went crazy
on this dude, Jay Crawford.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.101
Shot him in a pizza parlor.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.276
Hey.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.408
What you doing here?

03:54.451 --> 03:55.626
WESLEY:
Crawford.

03:55.670 --> 03:56.627
What's up, man?

03:56.671 --> 03:58.499
[gunshots]

03:59.326 --> 04:01.502
[panting]

04:01.545 --> 04:03.504
MURPHY:
Who the hell's Jay Crawford?

04:03.547 --> 04:05.723
This dealer. He took over
some of our territor...

04:05.767 --> 04:08.944
It doesn't matter. The point is
Tyson and I were there

04:08.987 --> 04:10.424
when he shot
the guy.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.295
You think Tyson said something?No.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.427
I made sure he wouldn't.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.950
But Wesley never
trusted Tyson.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.517
I never knew why.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.083
But if Wesley heard
that Tyson was dealing

04:18.127 --> 04:19.433
for someone else
on the side...

04:19.476 --> 04:20.825
He'd think Tyson had

04:20.869 --> 04:22.566
two separate loyalties.Exactly.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.960
Tyson becomes too much
of a liability for him.

04:25.003 --> 04:29.530
Okay, so Wesley finds out
that Tyson is dealing for Evan,

04:29.573 --> 04:31.271
doesn't trust him
anymore,

04:31.314 --> 04:33.273
kills Tyson
so that Tyson won't tell anyone

04:33.316 --> 04:35.318
that Wesley killed
this Crawford dude.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.580
Yes?

There's not enough on him.

If you go to the cops,
he will not get convicted.

our own people.

together?
