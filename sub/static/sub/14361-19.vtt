<i>Out here in the Middle,</i>

00:06.211 --> 00:08.781
<i>one thing you can count on</i>
<i>is after a long, cold winter,</i>

00:08.886 --> 00:11.698
<i>spring arrives with</i>
<i>all its hope and possibilities.</i>

00:11.806 --> 00:14.701
<i>And this spring,</i>
<i>everything was coming up Sue.</i>

00:14.826 --> 00:16.236
(School bell rings)

00:16.331 --> 00:18.633
Hey, Sue.
How'd the driver's test go?

00:18.814 --> 00:20.105
Oh, I failed again.

00:20.209 --> 00:22.192
<i>But</i> the examiner
only had to scream

00:22.304 --> 00:25.370
and hit the brakes twice,
so I think I'm getting better.

00:25.509 --> 00:27.830
Well, I got you this
beach-scented air freshener

00:27.933 --> 00:29.595
at the car wash
for when you passed,

00:29.804 --> 00:31.552
but it's sort of
losing its scent.

00:31.704 --> 00:33.637
So I'll just
give it to you for luck.

00:33.739 --> 00:34.981
Aw!

00:35.153 --> 00:35.761
(Sniffs)

00:35.860 --> 00:38.545
Oh, I love the beach.
Thanks.

00:40.162 --> 00:41.172
(Closes locker door)

00:41.872 --> 00:43.323
'Kay. Bye.

00:43.423 --> 00:44.876
- Bye.
- Bye!

00:44.877 --> 00:46.275
Bye.

00:46.933 --> 00:48.659
(Man) Let's go, ladies!
Bus is leaving.

00:48.773 --> 00:50.255
(Girls speaking indistinctly)

00:51.494 --> 00:53.734
Oh, excuse me!
Did somebody forget this?

00:53.883 --> 00:56.762
Let's go! Do you want to be
on the tennis team or not?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.026
Yes!

01:01.852 --> 01:02.989
<i>Axl, on the other hand,</i>

01:03.084 --> 01:05.426
<i>was in the middle</i>
<i>of a long cold snap.</i>

01:06.873 --> 01:08.400
'Sup?

01:08.539 --> 01:09.950
Uh, I don't know, Axl.

01:10.059 --> 01:11.173
I've been calling you
and texting you

01:11.283 --> 01:13.386
for the past two days,
and you haven't responded.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.261
So when you ask me
what's "'sup,"

01:15.427 --> 01:17.421
I'm not sure I know
how to answer that question.

01:17.532 --> 01:19.176
My friends usually
just say "'sup" back.

01:19.267 --> 01:20.981
Well, I'm super happy
for your friends.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.549
But my boyfriend
usually answers my phone calls.

01:23.655 --> 01:25.182
Maybe I've been
avoiding your calls

01:25.288 --> 01:27.422
'cause I thought you were busy
with somebody else.

01:27.512 --> 01:28.295
What do you mean?

01:28.414 --> 01:29.160
What I mean is,

01:29.272 --> 01:30.590
I went by your house
the other day...

01:30.743 --> 01:33.413
(Chuckles) saw you holding hands
with your old boyfriend.

01:33.522 --> 01:35.638
(Exhales) I was walking
to the car,

01:35.759 --> 01:37.501
and Cliff
grabbed my hand, but--

01:37.641 --> 01:39.585
Ha! Busted.

01:39.699 --> 01:42.225
<i>But...</i> I was mortified,
and when I got in the car,

01:42.340 --> 01:43.616
I told him
that was so not okay,

01:43.727 --> 01:44.862
because I have a boyfriend.

01:44.975 --> 01:46.629
Well, seems like
Cliff's your boyfriend now,

01:46.719 --> 01:48.600
so why don't you two
just buy a hippie van

01:48.715 --> 01:51.016
and go spend the rest of
your lives living on a commune

01:51.115 --> 01:52.886
delivering vegetables
in a box to people?

01:53.036 --> 01:55.046
Look, I asked you
about a hundred times

01:55.164 --> 01:56.568
if him being here
made you uncomfortable,

01:56.690 --> 01:58.359
and you kept saying
you were cool with it.

01:58.464 --> 02:00.211
"I'm cool. It's cool.
It's cool.

02:00.311 --> 02:01.377
We're cool. Uhh!"

02:01.471 --> 02:02.483
Well, if you had
to keep asking me,

02:02.590 --> 02:03.539
maybe you could have
figured out

02:03.652 --> 02:05.369
- I wasn't cool with it.
- That's not fair.

02:05.486 --> 02:07.322
If you have a problem,
you need to talk to me

02:07.440 --> 02:09.497
instead of being so immature.

02:10.056 --> 02:11.538
You know, forget it.

02:11.824 --> 02:13.502
I don't even know what to say.

02:13.983 --> 02:15.662
(Exhales, growls)

02:16.066 --> 02:17.130
By the way,

02:17.251 --> 02:20.792
I <i>love</i> having a girlfriend!
It's <i>so</i> much fun!

02:21.003 --> 02:22.502
All right, just a heads-up--

02:22.649 --> 02:25.110
finale of "The Bachelor"
is on tomorrow night.

02:25.221 --> 02:26.093
So if you want dinner,

02:26.195 --> 02:27.753
you're gonna have to drive
and get it yourself.

02:27.958 --> 02:28.978
Okay.

02:29.089 --> 02:31.662
Hey, if you wanna take me
on a romantic helicopter ride

02:31.773 --> 02:34.439
over a volcano in Hawaii,
be my guest.

02:34.536 --> 02:36.525
Until then, this is my escape.

02:36.677 --> 02:37.983
I thought The Oscars
were your escape.

02:38.082 --> 02:39.706
I have a lot
to escape from, okay?

02:39.934 --> 02:41.023
Hey, Brick, listen--

02:41.147 --> 02:42.872
Yeah, I know. "The Bachelor."

02:42.954 --> 02:45.211
<i>Yep, everybody knew that</i>
<i>when "The Bachelor" was on,</i>

02:45.331 --> 02:47.479
<i>I was 100% focused.</i>

02:47.625 --> 02:49.602
<i>(Man speaking indistinctly on TV)</i>
I got a D on my geography test.

02:49.762 --> 02:51.087
(Pen clicks) Teacher says
you have to sign it.

02:51.182 --> 02:52.897
Good job.
(Scribbles)

02:53.624 --> 02:55.258
Can I stay out
past my curfew tonight?

02:55.364 --> 02:57.119
Darrin and I are gonna
go make out in his car.

02:57.222 --> 02:58.407
Have fun.

02:59.499 --> 03:01.049
Lost another library book.

03:01.192 --> 03:03.449
They said we need to pay
full price to replace it.

03:03.573 --> 03:05.325
<i>(TV playing indistinctly)</i>

03:05.437 --> 03:06.374
Hmm.

03:07.099 --> 03:07.943
(Door closes)

03:08.044 --> 03:09.951
Whoo! What a game.

03:10.072 --> 03:12.182
I mean match. I learned
that one halfway through.

03:12.309 --> 03:15.322
I have to replace
my electrolytes.

03:16.115 --> 03:17.353
(Bottles clink)

03:17.466 --> 03:18.276
(Refrigerator door closes)

03:18.370 --> 03:19.694
You are looking
at the newest member

03:19.801 --> 03:21.500
of the Orson High tennis team.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.435
You made the tennis team?

03:23.549 --> 03:26.308
Well, I didn't "make it,"
per se.

03:26.450 --> 03:27.875
The coach thought
I was on the team.

03:28.021 --> 03:29.364
I tried to tell him
that I wasn't,

03:29.480 --> 03:31.737
but then he realized that
he didn't have enough players,

03:31.880 --> 03:34.128
so without me,
they would have lost the match.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.293
So you won?

03:35.398 --> 03:37.337
Oh, God, no.
On the last point,

03:37.444 --> 03:40.673
I hit what my coach called
a "very weak lob,"

03:40.804 --> 03:42.241
and my opponent hit
what he called

03:42.372 --> 03:45.185
a "blistering overhead smash."

03:45.287 --> 03:46.804
Is that how you hurt your face?

03:46.949 --> 03:49.516
No. A bird flew in
the bus window on the way home.

03:49.639 --> 03:50.957
I never saw it coming.

03:51.079 --> 03:52.230
Beaks are sharp.

03:52.338 --> 03:54.815
So the next match
is against Terre Haute,

03:54.953 --> 03:56.920
and my coach said he really
wants me to,

03:57.035 --> 03:59.348
- uh, what's the word?
- Quit?

03:59.472 --> 04:01.774
Drill. So, dad, I was hoping
you could go out

04:01.911 --> 04:02.934
and do some drills with me.

04:03.037 --> 04:04.354
- Mm.
- Please?

04:04.472 --> 04:06.246
You're the only person
who could help me get better.

04:06.364 --> 04:07.150
I don't know, Sue.

04:07.270 --> 04:08.423
Every time I try
to teach you a sport,

04:08.539 --> 04:11.106
I yell, you cry.
It's a whole thing.

04:11.244 --> 04:12.560
What your dad is trying to say

04:12.664 --> 04:14.593
is that he would love
to help you.

04:14.736 --> 04:16.899
Oh, yes! Thank you,
thank you, thank you,

04:17.000 --> 04:18.045
thank you, thank you.

04:18.148 --> 04:20.277
Oh, and, mom, I'm gonna need
to pay for this uniform,

04:20.392 --> 04:22.437
so I'm gonna need
a check for...

04:22.893 --> 04:25.327
You know what? I'll ask you
during "The Bachelor."

04:29.292 --> 04:32.566
Okay. Let's practice
your hand-eye coordination.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.935
I want you to practice
bouncing the ball

04:35.058 --> 04:37.351
up and down
on your racquet like this.

04:37.631 --> 04:39.585
- Okay? Give it a shot.
- Mm-hmm.

04:45.544 --> 04:47.285
How long should
I do this for, dad?

04:47.393 --> 04:49.057
Till I finish
the sports section.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.831
Okay. Let's work
on your forehand.

04:54.418 --> 04:55.918
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.070 --> 04:57.065
All right.

04:58.242 --> 04:59.407
- Whoa!
- Uhh!

04:59.537 --> 05:00.683
Keep your eye on the ball.

05:00.812 --> 05:03.291
And, uh, try saying,
"bounce, hit."

05:04.724 --> 05:06.676
Bounce, hit.
(Thwack)

05:08.922 --> 05:11.981
Wow. Where was that when I was
trying to teach you softball?

05:13.807 --> 05:15.199
Bounce, hit.
(Thwack)

05:15.443 --> 05:16.586
Attagirl.

05:18.897 --> 05:20.063
Bounce, hit.

05:20.166 --> 05:21.388
Wow! (Laughs)

05:21.619 --> 05:24.551
Sue, I gotta say, you are
not totally horrible at this.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.233
Wha... oh, dad, stop.

05:27.392 --> 05:29.293
You're embarrassing me.

05:31.394 --> 05:33.347
I'm telling you, Frankie,
she kept her eye on the ball.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.045
- She moved her feet. She had some power.
- Mm-hmm. (Crunches)

05:36.157 --> 05:37.381
Ugh! (Spits)

05:37.488 --> 05:39.896
Chip clip, people!
Not that hard!

05:39.978 --> 05:41.144
She was really good.

05:41.237 --> 05:42.856
I mean, all in the realm
of Sue,

05:42.944 --> 05:44.574
but she's not a disaster.

05:44.685 --> 05:45.777
Oh, that's great.

05:46.169 --> 05:47.342
Are you even listening to me?

05:47.488 --> 05:48.688
You remember Sue, right?

05:48.810 --> 05:50.584
The one who threw a baseball
into her own eye?

05:50.685 --> 05:51.587
I'm sorry, Mike.

05:51.686 --> 05:53.451
This is a big night for me.

05:53.541 --> 05:56.130
Blake is choosing
between Alissa and Kendall.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.925
Are you sure you don't
wanna watch with me?

05:58.063 --> 06:00.317
I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

06:00.464 --> 06:01.965

You're jealous of Cliff,

so you pout and ignore me
for three days.

08:11.057 --> 08:14.081

sing songs, and light fires.

into the same issue, Axl--

08:20.868 --> 08:22.096
you gotta think
a little bit more

08:22.205 --> 08:23.402
before you do stuff.

08:23.499 --> 08:24.832
I'm sorry, but when
I'm into someone,

08:24.937 --> 08:27.374
I don't think with my head,
I just go with my instincts.

08:27.478 --> 08:29.945
Well, your instincts
almost burned my house down.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.309
Why can't you just talk?

08:31.389 --> 08:32.956
Why can't you
just stop talking?

08:33.352 --> 08:35.376
Sorry, Axl, I use words.

08:35.498 --> 08:37.788
And I need to be with someone
who can do that, too.

08:37.876 --> 08:38.938
Well, excuse me.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.429
I didn't realize
when we started dating,

08:40.524 --> 08:43.181
I had signed a contract saying
I had to be exactly like <i>you.</i>

08:43.275 --> 08:44.216
And you know what?

08:44.330 --> 08:45.913
I came up with
an awesome rhyme for "Cassidy,"

08:46.063 --> 08:47.629
but now you're not
gonna hear it.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.348
Was it "rhapsody"?

08:50.424 --> 08:52.227
(Exhales) No.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.423
Okay, Sue, here we go.

09:01.634 --> 09:02.525
(Thwack)

09:04.057 --> 09:08.296
Ohh. Great serve!
Really nice!

09:08.388 --> 09:09.724
<i>(Man over PA) 15-love.</i>

09:10.336 --> 09:11.025
(Thwack)

09:11.956 --> 09:13.080
<i>30-love.</i>

09:13.181 --> 09:15.869
Oh, that one was even better
than the last one.

09:16.300 --> 09:17.123
(Laughs)

09:17.218 --> 09:18.369
Okay, Sue, come on,
shake it off.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.115
Remember, bounce, hit.

09:23.392 --> 09:24.278
(Thwack)

09:24.894 --> 09:26.011
Out!

09:26.128 --> 09:27.649
No, I'm pretty sure
that was in, dad.

09:27.722 --> 09:29.277
Uh, no, Sue,
I'm pretty sure it was out.

09:29.398 --> 09:32.157
Well, maybe too close to call.

09:32.492 --> 09:33.918
Okay, it's yours!

09:34.021 --> 09:35.244
<i>40-love.</i>

09:38.234 --> 09:39.152
Ugh.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.378
You're still in bed?

09:40.934 --> 09:44.371
Yeah, I'm having a little
trouble gettin' it going today.

09:44.566 --> 09:46.761
It's 4:30. I'd say you're
havin' a lot of trouble.

09:46.997 --> 09:47.870
(Groans)

09:48.577 --> 09:51.214
I just can't believe
he picked Kendall.

09:51.301 --> 09:52.530
Are you kiddin' me?

09:52.644 --> 09:54.393
No. No. Listen to me--

09:54.680 --> 09:56.932
it was all lined up
for him and Alissa.

09:57.059 --> 09:59.053
They both shared
a passion for sailing.

09:59.151 --> 10:00.857
They both loved
the elliptical machine.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.795
And, yeah, you can say there's
no accounting for chemistry.

10:03.915 --> 10:06.994
But it's not a chemistry thing.
Trust me, there was chemistry.

10:07.111 --> 10:09.613
Ugh. I'm starting to think
I don't know Blake at all.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.056
That's because you don't.

10:11.161 --> 10:13.466
Ugh. I'm not talking to you
about this anymore.

10:13.644 --> 10:14.428
Promise?

10:14.512 --> 10:16.734
So how was the game?
Sue do okay?

10:16.831 --> 10:18.350
Uh... she did not.

10:18.906 --> 10:20.249
She didn't win a single point.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.957
Oh, crap. Is she upset?

10:23.073 --> 10:24.212
She's never been happier.

10:24.296 --> 10:25.745
Said it was the best day
of her life.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.633
Oh, well, that's good.
I'm glad she's happy.

10:28.742 --> 10:29.601
You should have
seen her out there.

10:29.709 --> 10:30.469
She spent the whole match

10:30.568 --> 10:31.943
telling her opponent
how great she was.

10:32.263 --> 10:33.383
Well, that's nice.

10:33.495 --> 10:35.877
No, it's not.
Frankie, sports is like life.

10:35.981 --> 10:37.040
If she's a pushover
on the court,

10:37.134 --> 10:38.562
she'll be a pushover in life.

10:38.664 --> 10:40.985
Or if she's nice on the court,
she'll be nice in life.

10:41.097 --> 10:42.959
The important thing is
she had fun.

10:43.067 --> 10:44.839
Fun?
The world is full of people

10:44.944 --> 10:47.937
warming themselves around
trash can fires who had fun.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.601
I'm not messing around here.
Sue's got some real promise.

10:50.876 --> 10:52.125
If we're gonna
take this thing seriously,

10:52.225 --> 10:53.551
we really gotta
start riding her.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.184
She got on a bus by accident.

10:55.303 --> 10:57.597
How seriously should we be
taking this? (Crunches)

10:57.693 --> 10:58.964
She's so frustrating.

10:59.813 --> 11:01.050
When I took her out
on that tennis court,

11:01.166 --> 11:03.052
she showed some real potential.

11:03.531 --> 11:04.860
(Whispers) Oh, God.

11:05.137 --> 11:05.890
What?

11:05.990 --> 11:07.479
It's just when Blake and Alissa
had their tennis date...

11:07.609 --> 11:10.173
(Blows raspberry) there was
such an ease between them.

11:10.354 --> 11:11.731
(Switch clicks)
(Sighs) I don't know.

11:11.865 --> 11:14.433
Maybe it was all
for the cameras. (Crunches)

11:15.182 --> 11:16.682
(Door opens and closes)

11:17.925 --> 11:18.914
Hey.

11:19.708 --> 11:20.787
'Sup?

11:20.884 --> 11:21.917
- 'Sup?
- 'Sup?

11:22.013 --> 11:22.816
Is Sue here?

11:22.931 --> 11:24.531
I told you never
to say her name around me.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.699
Axl, is there a difference
between a chat room

11:26.822 --> 11:27.825
and a message board?

11:27.932 --> 11:30.171
Yeah. One's for losers,
and one's for total losers.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.865
Actually, Mrs. Heck,

11:31.976 --> 11:33.784
a chat room is like
a conversation with a person,

11:33.891 --> 11:35.146
like we're having right now,

11:35.263 --> 11:36.483
and a message board
is just a place

11:36.567 --> 11:37.928
for you to post your thoughts.

11:38.033 --> 11:38.924
Thank you, Sean.

11:39.026 --> 11:40.776
And would you mind staying
and being my son?

11:40.906 --> 11:42.243
(Mouths words)

11:43.368 --> 11:45.195
Dude, what's up
with the chick food?

11:45.393 --> 11:47.901
What? Me and Cassidy used to get
together on Wednesday nights

11:48.014 --> 11:49.853
to make these big salads,
but screw it.

11:49.984 --> 11:51.478
I don't need her
to make a salad.

11:51.726 --> 11:53.331
She's not the president
of salad.

11:53.452 --> 11:55.408
As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna Instagram this

11:55.520 --> 11:57.922
so she can see me
makin' a salad.

11:58.055 --> 11:59.293
(Chuckles)
(Camera shutter clicks)

11:59.405 --> 12:00.173
Do you guys know how to make

12:00.301 --> 12:01.987
that frowny face thing
on the computer?

12:02.079 --> 12:03.307
I'm on the "Bachelor" fan site,

12:03.409 --> 12:05.579
and lovestv73 thinks Blake
made the right move

12:05.696 --> 12:06.968
in picking Kendall.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.379
A frowny face is just
a colon and a backwards--

12:09.483 --> 12:10.987
Would you stop helping her?

12:11.111 --> 12:11.848
(Grater scraping)

12:11.989 --> 12:13.727
So you and Cassidy are done?

12:13.980 --> 12:15.834
What's going on?
Caxl's breaking up?

12:15.939 --> 12:17.095
I don't know.
(Clatter)

12:17.306 --> 12:18.347
But I'm a man,

12:18.440 --> 12:19.977
so I'm not gonna go
crawling back and ask her.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.791
Who wants candied pecans?
(Pecans rattling)

12:21.902 --> 12:23.900
You know, sometimes when
Sue and I are having a fight,

12:24.034 --> 12:25.997
I just reach out
and gently touch--

12:26.101 --> 12:27.384
I swear to God, Darrin.

12:27.524 --> 12:29.167
(Voice breaking) You guys
want fresh croutons?

12:29.296 --> 12:30.963
- Dude, seriously?
- Hells, yeah!

12:31.081 --> 12:32.542
Give me some day-old bread.
I'll make 'em right now.

12:32.643 --> 12:34.437
Aw, come on.
That's a load of crap!

12:34.550 --> 12:38.046
Guys, let's say you took
two girls on a horseback ride,

12:38.158 --> 12:39.784
and one you totally
connected with

12:39.893 --> 12:41.157
and had an amazing time,

12:41.289 --> 12:44.111
and she looked great
in cowboy boots and a sundress,

12:44.229 --> 12:46.250
and the other one
was all wussy about it

12:46.385 --> 12:47.800
and kept pretending
she needed help

12:47.932 --> 12:50.154
and was closing her eyes
and giggling like an idiot.

12:50.289 --> 12:51.901
Which one
would you want to marry?

12:52.068 --> 12:53.626
I only have eyes for Sue.

12:53.755 --> 12:56.042
You have one more, Darrin.
One more.

12:56.537 --> 12:57.632
(Clinking)

12:58.449 --> 12:59.712
(Ball thudding)

12:59.854 --> 13:00.891
Oh.

13:01.112 --> 13:02.521
Looking good, Sue!

13:02.625 --> 13:03.956
Ready for Lawrenceville
on Friday?

13:04.062 --> 13:05.663
Oh, are you kidding?
I can't wait.

13:05.781 --> 13:07.234
They have such a pretty campus.

13:07.384 --> 13:08.654
Yeah, I'm sure they do.

13:08.801 --> 13:11.061
But, uh, listen, Sue,
I wanted to talk to you.

13:11.197 --> 13:14.915
Um, you were awful nice
out there the other day,

13:15.053 --> 13:16.283
complimenting the other team.

13:16.418 --> 13:17.614
Thanks, dad.

13:17.761 --> 13:18.756
Well, let me finish.

13:18.970 --> 13:22.086
See, sports isn't
about being nice.

13:22.509 --> 13:24.431
Sports is about
being competitive.

13:24.541 --> 13:25.935
It's about wanting
to beat the other person.

13:26.054 --> 13:28.831
Oh. I think I remember my coach
saying something about that.

13:28.989 --> 13:31.105
Okay. So if you
really wanna win,

13:31.206 --> 13:32.963
you gotta dig down deep.

13:33.066 --> 13:34.572
You gotta get in touch
with that anger.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.404
What anger?

13:36.515 --> 13:37.851
The anger that's inside you.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.297
I don't have
any anger inside me.

13:40.422 --> 13:41.516
(Gasps) Dad,

13:41.700 --> 13:43.645
do you have anger inside <i>you?</i>

13:44.881 --> 13:46.561
A little bit.

13:46.758 --> 13:48.026
Okay, okay.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.826
When you're being
a wrestlerette,

13:49.922 --> 13:51.026
and you're cheering
for the wrestlers,

13:51.128 --> 13:53.043
you want them to win,
or do you want them to lose?

13:53.177 --> 13:54.295
I want them to win!

13:54.400 --> 13:55.925
Okay. So when you're out
on the tennis court,

13:56.085 --> 13:59.096
think of yourself
as your own cheerleader.

13:59.653 --> 14:01.707
Oh. I like that.

14:01.855 --> 14:03.834
Okay. So if you're
your own cheerleader,

14:04.027 --> 14:06.726
do you want yourself to win,
or you want yourself to lose?

14:07.879 --> 14:09.961
I want myself to <i>win.</i>

14:10.066 --> 14:11.008
So who you gonna root for?

14:11.118 --> 14:12.217
- Sue!
- Go, Sue!

14:12.319 --> 14:13.522
- Go, Sue!
- Go, Sue!

14:13.626 --> 14:14.639
- Go, Sue!
- Sue!

14:14.733 --> 14:16.309
(Both chanting)
Sue! Sue! Sue! Sue!

14:16.827 --> 14:18.165
Hit that ball!
(Grunts)

14:18.300 --> 14:19.429
Nice!
(Grunts)

14:19.944 --> 14:20.748
Aah!

14:22.000 --> 14:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:29.896 --> 14:31.112
(Sniffles)

14:31.298 --> 14:32.362
Really?

14:32.474 --> 14:33.903
(Crying) I know. I know.

14:34.016 --> 14:35.553
I am being ridiculous.

14:35.650 --> 14:38.602
It's a stupid TV show,
but I just can't shake it.

14:38.715 --> 14:41.249
I mean, I was actually
doing okay. I really was.

14:41.399 --> 14:43.089
And then "People" magazine

14:43.200 --> 14:45.492
came out with
all their honeymoon plans.

14:45.957 --> 14:48.462
He's taking Kendall
to Aruba, Mike.

14:48.831 --> 14:50.581
(Crying) Aruba!

14:50.683 --> 14:52.182
20 years, and I've
never once slapped you,

14:52.298 --> 14:54.082
but... God help me.

14:54.198 --> 14:55.607
Well, don't judge me!

14:55.718 --> 14:58.612
At least I'm not afraid
of my emotions, you coward!

15:00.754 --> 15:01.787
(School bell rings)

15:02.081 --> 15:03.776
(Shouting over each other)

15:04.487 --> 15:06.437
(Cheering)

15:06.981 --> 15:08.686
Let me show you
how this is <i>done.</i>

15:08.800 --> 15:10.017
(Courtney) Okay, Axl,
you're next.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.007
Ooh, you do not wanna go up
against the Ax-Man, all right?

15:12.104 --> 15:13.739
They're gonna have to rush you
to the thumb emergency room.

15:13.837 --> 15:16.616
I can totally beat you.
I have freakishly strong thumbs.

15:16.714 --> 15:17.918
- Hmm.
- Tell him, Deb.

15:18.030 --> 15:19.629
She does.
They're freakishly strong.

15:19.772 --> 15:21.950
What's the matter?
You scared?

15:22.052 --> 15:23.061
Is he scared, Court?

15:23.180 --> 15:24.871
- I'm pretty sure he's scared.
- We're pretty sure you're scared.

15:24.978 --> 15:27.391
Okay. Let's do this!

15:27.494 --> 15:28.833
(Sean) - Go, Ax-Man.
(Axl) - Whoo!

15:28.942 --> 15:30.495
(Courtney and Debbie)
One, two, three, four!

15:30.598 --> 15:32.329
We declare a thumb war!

15:32.558 --> 15:33.797
Tickle torture!

15:33.940 --> 15:35.328
(Laughs)
Aah! Come on!

15:35.448 --> 15:37.897
- Oh! Aah!
(Courtney and Debbie) - Oh!

15:39.631 --> 15:40.718
Okay.

15:42.026 --> 15:44.217
Remember now--
be tough. Be strong.

15:44.349 --> 15:45.481
Root for Sue!

15:45.624 --> 15:46.631
Got it.

15:47.339 --> 15:49.962
(Gasps) I really like
her tennis skirt.

15:50.073 --> 15:52.154
Is it okay if I tell her
before we start?

15:52.267 --> 15:53.553
No. Now come on.

15:54.198 --> 15:55.948
Sue. Sue. Sue.

15:56.054 --> 15:57.241
(Both chanting)
Sue. Sue. Sue.

15:57.374 --> 16:00.748
Sue. Sue. Sue. Sue.
Sue. Sue. Sue. Sue.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.673
- Okay.
- Okay, Sue, here we go!

16:04.635 --> 16:05.658
(Thwack)

16:06.448 --> 16:07.455
<i>(Man over PA) 15-love.</i>

16:07.573 --> 16:08.927
Wow! That was...

16:09.167 --> 16:11.082
Mnh-mnh.

16:12.445 --> 16:13.302
(Thwack)

16:14.392 --> 16:15.203
<i>30-love.</i>

16:15.293 --> 16:16.464
I'm sorry.
I just have to say something.

16:16.567 --> 16:18.973
You are so good.
You are amazing.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.066
That shot was amazing.

16:20.168 --> 16:21.793
And not just that shot,
all of the shots.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.874
You must have practiced so hard
to get this good,

16:23.980 --> 16:25.838
and I am so sorry
I didn't say something earlier.

16:34.231 --> 16:35.116
<i>Fault.</i>

16:35.227 --> 16:36.782
Ooh. Really nice try.

16:36.902 --> 16:39.928
I-I think last time, you may
have tossed it a little higher.

16:40.871 --> 16:41.487
(Thwack)

16:41.890 --> 16:42.724
<i>Double fault.</i>

16:42.819 --> 16:43.616
<i>30-15.</i>

16:43.713 --> 16:44.806
Yeah, I think you tossed
the ball

16:44.894 --> 16:46.772
a little <i>too</i> high that time.

16:46.935 --> 16:49.456
Don't worry.
You'll do better next time.

16:52.201 --> 16:53.036
(Thwack)

16:53.621 --> 16:54.250
<i>Fault.</i>

16:54.352 --> 16:56.891
- Shake it off. You got this.
(Under breath) - Shut up.

16:57.003 --> 16:59.374
<i>Turns out Sue's niceness</i>
<i>was her greatest weapon.</i>

16:59.505 --> 17:00.734
<i>And as the match went on,</i>

17:00.874 --> 17:02.854
<i>she unleashed</i>
<i>a barrage of sweetness</i>

17:02.957 --> 17:03.855
<i>on her opponent.</i>

17:03.972 --> 17:05.001
Awesome try.

17:05.261 --> 17:06.060
(Thwack)

17:06.491 --> 17:07.179
<i>Game.</i>

17:07.290 --> 17:08.128
Ooh!

17:08.220 --> 17:09.359
Just missed.

17:09.464 --> 17:11.248
Great form, though.
(Scoffs)

17:11.404 --> 17:13.262
Good girl, Sue. Keep hittin' her
with the compliments.

17:13.356 --> 17:14.193
Don't let up.

17:14.301 --> 17:14.907
(Thwack)

17:15.324 --> 17:16.386
<i>Game.</i>

17:17.252 --> 17:19.255
You are almost there.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.468
Next time, I swear!

17:24.366 --> 17:26.460
All right.
Looking good. Looking good.

17:29.909 --> 17:31.012
Cute headband, by the way.

17:31.124 --> 17:32.982
Shut up! Just shut up!

17:33.580 --> 17:34.452
(Grunts)

17:34.808 --> 17:36.999
- Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.443
Unsportsmanlike conduct.

17:38.593 --> 17:40.894
Lawrenceville forfeits
the match.

17:40.997 --> 17:42.574
<i>And then three words</i>
<i>were spoken</i>

17:42.695 --> 17:44.563
<i>that have never</i>
<i>been said before...</i>

17:44.662 --> 17:46.581
Sue Heck wins!

17:48.639 --> 17:50.571
- That's my girl!
- Aah!

17:50.686 --> 17:51.697
(Laughs)

17:51.812 --> 17:52.755
You did it!

17:52.849 --> 17:54.927
Aah! I did it! (Laughs)

18:02.284 --> 18:03.440
<i>So after six days,</i>

18:03.556 --> 18:05.549
<i>it was finally time</i>
<i>to move on...</i>

18:05.936 --> 18:07.489
<i>to booze.</i>
(Wine pours)

18:10.046 --> 18:11.002
(Refrigerator opens)

18:11.101 --> 18:12.143
What are you doing up?

18:12.319 --> 18:14.091
Sometimes I get up
in the middle of the night

18:14.202 --> 18:15.780
to eat Axl's leftover salad.

18:15.888 --> 18:18.262
Have you tasted it?
He really has a gift.

18:18.452 --> 18:19.212
Mm.

18:19.733 --> 18:20.701
How come you're up?

18:21.198 --> 18:22.538
It's "The Bachelor," Brick.

18:22.646 --> 18:24.399
I don't know why
I can't get over it.

18:24.519 --> 18:26.055
Even Alissa has moved on.

18:26.171 --> 18:29.510
She's dating a Tennessee Titan,
and she's back teaching Zumba.

18:29.645 --> 18:31.727
Well, she always
has been resilient.

18:31.881 --> 18:33.058
(Crunches) Who?

18:33.211 --> 18:34.257
Alissa.

18:34.536 --> 18:35.634
Remember the sixth episode

18:35.736 --> 18:37.790
when they went fly fishing
in Montana?

18:38.008 --> 18:40.418
She was so embarrassed
because she was the only one

18:40.545 --> 18:42.608
who couldn't figure out
how to bait her hook.

18:42.716 --> 18:44.047
But she stuck to it,

18:44.205 --> 18:46.668
and she ended up catching
that speckled trout.

18:47.435 --> 18:49.036
How do you know all this?

18:49.583 --> 18:50.858
<i>(Woman on TV)</i>
<i>Of course I was mad.</i>

18:50.968 --> 18:53.387
<i>Blake was doing jell-o shots</i>
<i>off Kendall's stomach.</i>

18:53.530 --> 18:55.923
(Whispers)
Jell-o shots.

18:57.038 --> 18:58.290
If you really
think about it, mom,

18:58.405 --> 19:00.787
it's actually a good thing
that Blake didn't pick Alissa.

19:01.025 --> 19:01.802
Why?

19:02.116 --> 19:03.843
Remember when she was
crying at the spa?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.429
She told her facialist

19:05.550 --> 19:09.318
that the one thing she wanted
more than anything was kids.

19:09.455 --> 19:11.593
And Blake made it very clear
in the hot tub

19:11.689 --> 19:13.444
that he didn't want kids.

19:13.603 --> 19:15.954
So... better he broke
her heart now

19:16.054 --> 19:17.772
than really breaking
her heart down the road

19:17.898 --> 19:20.384
when she wanted a family
and he didn't.

19:21.768 --> 19:22.983
(Exhales deeply)

19:23.092 --> 19:24.364
<i>And just like that,</i>

19:24.473 --> 19:27.239
<i>the weight of the world</i>
<i>was lifted off me.</i>

19:27.534 --> 19:29.139
You know, Brick, you're right.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.921
I never thought about it
like that.

19:31.011 --> 19:33.290
For me, it was over
when he booted Jessica.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.711
But then I got online

19:34.825 --> 19:36.365
and saw her meltdown
in the confessional,

19:36.504 --> 19:38.172
and she is a whackadoodle.

19:38.295 --> 19:39.574
- Totally.
- Absolutely.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.507
- Yeah.
- But my favorite episode has to be

19:41.633 --> 19:43.057
the one where
they all go scuba diving.

19:43.158 --> 19:45.992
- I love that one.
- But Kendall thinks that it's snorkeling.

19:46.092 --> 19:50.005
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. <i>That night, I had
the best sleep I had in a long time.</i>

19:50.242 --> 19:53.620
<i>Turns out all I needed</i>
<i>was someone who understood me.</i>

19:54.013 --> 19:56.710
<i>I just never imagined</i>
<i>that person would be Brick.</i>

19:56.810 --> 19:58.063
<i>But he was right.</i>

19:58.159 --> 20:00.579
<i>It's like Alissa said</i>
<i>at the moonlight clambake--</i>

20:00.693 --> 20:01.844
<i>love is like a river.</i>

20:01.940 --> 20:05.553
<i>It will cut a new path whenever it
meets an obstacle.</i> (Clink on window)

20:06.842 --> 20:08.061
(Clink)

20:10.372 --> 20:11.446
(Clink)

20:18.124 --> 20:20.281
(Crackling)

20:21.453 --> 20:24.457
(Crickets chirping)

20:28.199 --> 20:30.236
You were right.
When you're in love,

20:30.347 --> 20:32.194
you don't
always think with your head.

20:32.430 --> 20:33.930
When I saw you
with that cheerleader,

20:34.042 --> 20:36.173
I wanted to rip
her stupid eyebrows off.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.296
Really?

20:37.386 --> 20:39.723
That's... pretty immature
on your part,

20:39.818 --> 20:42.362
but still cool.
(Laughs)

20:42.977 --> 20:45.428
(Clatter) Actually, I've got
a lot of things I could say,

20:45.577 --> 20:48.515
like "sorry"
and "I'm an idiot,"

20:48.516 --> 20:51.912
and your Instagram really
made me miss your salad...

20:52.335 --> 20:54.989
but I'm not gonna stand here
and make you talk about it.

20:55.529 --> 20:56.783
That's even cooler.

20:56.894 --> 20:58.921
But I am gonna do this...
