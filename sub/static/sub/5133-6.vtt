00:10.480 --> 00:11.811
Previously on "Power"...

00:11.960 --> 00:14.122
Víbora Ruiz has a thing
for poisonous snakes.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.845
I got you just the ticket

00:16.000 --> 00:18.321
to get you in the high council
of the Soldado Nation.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.960
Happy High Holy Day, Víbora.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.766
What's going on
between my husband and Tommy?

00:23.960 --> 00:25.405
You can tell me.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.642
It'll be another one
of our little secrets.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.604
I want to know
what we're doing here.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.485
- Are we just fucking?
- I am making a choice with you.

00:32.640 --> 00:33.926
This ain't some
skank-ass broad.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.764
Holly's different.
She's special.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.524
You better not have told her
about our other thing.

00:37.720 --> 00:38.881
I told you it was Ruiz all along.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.280
Yeah, except when you said
it was Anibal.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.727
Except then. I don't care.
Now I just want to kill a motherfucker.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.611
Ruiz got stabbed.
It wasn't the Jamaicans we hired.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.842
Someone went after him and missed.
He ain't dead.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.604
Back then, Kanan kept us in line,

00:49.760 --> 00:51.444
taught us the business,
made us men.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.365
Ghost and I owe your father big.
That's why you're here.

02:21.100 --> 02:28.050
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

02:37.560 --> 02:39.164
Check.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.448
You ain't gonna
get me this time, K.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.880
I've been practicing.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.121
Yes, you have.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.651
Checkmate, motherfucker.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.246
- What the fuck you talking about?
- You see it.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.526
Don't make me smile
you up right here, motherfucker.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.284
Your mama won't appreciate
no closed casket.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.761
Kanan, you got a visitor.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.930
Yeah?

03:16.080 --> 03:18.401
You need to stop
with that Ruy Lopez bullshit.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.846
Rack 'em back up.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.445
I'll be back.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.371
I been saying
the same shit all along.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.727
We're calling it
prosecutorial misconduct.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.360
I don't give a fuck what you call it
as long as it means I get out.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.449
The police officer
that stopped you

03:31.600 --> 03:34.331
admitted that the prosecutor
told him to omit

03:34.520 --> 03:36.090
certain elements from his report,

03:36.240 --> 03:37.765
including the fact
that your back headlight,

03:37.920 --> 03:40.161
the reason why he stopped you
in the first place,

03:40.360 --> 03:42.840
wasn't blown out,
but rather had been removed...

03:43.000 --> 03:44.525
- Mm-hmm.
- ...the bulb unscrewed.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.842
Somebody wanted me to get pulled over
with drugs in the trunk.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.161
I told my first lawyer that shit.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.526
They set my ass up.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.728
It doesn't matter
that you were set up.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.724
It matters that the prosecutor
had material evidence

03:54.920 --> 03:57.287
to support that theory
and hid those facts,

03:57.440 --> 03:59.204
- so the jury never knew.
- Okay.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.442
The D.A. figured Kanan's
young and black, he's guilty.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.090
Who gives a shit
about the rules?

04:03.240 --> 04:04.366
This D.A. has a bunch of cases

04:04.520 --> 04:06.648
under judicial review.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.723
That's why you're getting out fast.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.848
When?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.531
Ain't you cold in that shit?

04:14.680 --> 04:17.125
Stopped standing
on the corner years ago.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.567
Don't need no puffy
working from the inside.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.767
You could do it too, boy.
You're smart.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.685
No, man. I love the streets.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.683
I ain't trying to be
no house nigga.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.571
Change come
from inside the house, Rolla.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.769
Who the fuck want to change?

04:31.920 --> 04:34.161
I heard Ruiz got hit.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.687
Stabbed inside
a motherfucking strip club.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.564
God damn.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.927
Strip club supposed to be
sacred, you feel me?

04:41.080 --> 04:42.809
One minute you getting
a good dick burn,

04:42.960 --> 04:44.724
next you getting
gutted open like a fish.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.086
Yeah.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.049
Streets are saying you did it.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.970
You ask for the weather report,
don't get mad

04:53.120 --> 04:54.645
when they say it's gonna rain.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.290
You believe what you heard?

04:56.480 --> 04:59.848
If y'all was behind it,
we'd be at Ruiz's funeral right now.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.482
But first Anibal, now this?

05:03.640 --> 05:06.610
You can't blame niggas
for wagging tongues.

05:08.440 --> 05:09.566
Looks like you cleaning house.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.245
Or you eliminating
the competition.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.286
- 'Sup, Em?
- I told you to stop it with that shit.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.363
If I was Eminem,
I'd be getting my dick sucked

05:21.520 --> 05:22.601
by some actress right now,

05:22.800 --> 05:24.325
not freezing my balls off
out here with you.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.689
Yo, Rolla says folks are saying
we called the hit on Ruiz.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.285
That's some bullshit.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.568
I say we go by tomorrow
and make sure he knows where we stand.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.290
I wouldn't walk in unprotected.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.364
Soldados shoot first,
ask questions after the fact.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.450
You want to come with me, Rolla?
I'll let you go in first.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.649
- Good to see you, G.
- My man.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.848
- Night, Marshall.
- Fuck you.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.770
I never get
why you like him so much.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.285
He's loyal and he's smart.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.805
He's too smart
to try some shit with Ruiz

05:50.960 --> 05:52.564
without knowing our play.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.245
You think "Cool Runnings"
gabbed off?

05:54.400 --> 05:55.811
Gabbed off about what?
Why would the Jamaicans brag

05:56.000 --> 05:57.161
about a botched hit?

05:57.320 --> 05:59.004
They didn't even hit Ruiz.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.128
Owe us a motherfucking
store credit.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.442
I know Ruiz didn't check
into no real hospital.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.601
Make sure you know
where he's hiding.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.167
- We'll go there tomorrow.
- Rolla is right about one thing.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.324
If the Soldados suspect us,
they'll have itchy trigger fingers.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.323
I better go alone.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.845
No fucking way.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.083
I ain't gonna let you get clipped
right before Tasha's birthday.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.164
If the worst happens,
she'll never forgive me.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.687
You forgot about her birthday?

06:22.840 --> 06:24.490
Damn, man,
she's your wife.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.130
How come I remember,
you don't?

06:26.320 --> 06:28.209
I got a lot on my mind,
Tommy.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.490
Well, you're welcome.
I'll call you when I get out.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.085
Do that.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.568
We could've met you
during the day.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.609
This is the only time
I could get away

06:46.800 --> 06:48.040
without them knowing
I was gone.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.725
That's live, so from now on,

06:49.880 --> 06:51.530
try to get yourself
near Ruiz and his top guys

06:51.720 --> 06:53.370
when you're talking business.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.807
Especially if they mention
Lobos or the distributor.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.086
We'll be able to hear everything.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.924
Everything,
so take the jacket off

06:59.080 --> 07:00.764
before you rub one out, okay?
I don't want to hear that shit.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.048
I thought you were
the reptile guy.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.531
You were supposed to.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.883
If anything happens,
we'll be on you in 30 seconds.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.930
It takes less than a second
for someone to pull the trigger.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.566
Then we'll be 29 seconds late.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.006
Fuck this.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.400
Get someone else
to be your snitch.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.244
Agent Knox
is just fucking with you.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.925
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.208
- You have my word.
- Your word?

07:27.360 --> 07:30.443
I'll remember that
when I'm bleeding out.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.931
Look at it this way.
Either wear the mic...

07:32.080 --> 07:34.242
...or try your luck up at Sing Sing.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.481
Pedos do
really good up there, I hear.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.250
- Fuck you.
- You flirting with him, Nomar?

07:37.400 --> 07:38.811
Enough!

07:41.080 --> 07:42.650
You don't have a choice.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.923
Fuck all of you, then.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.888
You're home early.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.281
Figured you'd be
at the club all night.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.808
Wasn't at the club.
I was with Tommy.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.650
I'd ask you what's up with Tommy,

08:01.800 --> 08:04.041
but you ain't gonna
tell me anyway, so...

08:04.200 --> 08:06.089
Well, I don't want
your pretty little head

08:06.240 --> 08:08.129
to worry about any of that.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.805
I want you to concentrate
on throwing yourself

08:09.960 --> 08:12.531
the biggest, best birthday party
money can buy.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.282
I thought you forgot.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.250
Now, you see that?

08:20.400 --> 08:22.243
You thought wrong.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.562
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, well, it would've been nice

08:24.720 --> 08:26.563
- to know a couple of weeks ago.
- But that would've ruined

08:26.720 --> 08:28.131
the whole surprise,
now, wouldn't it?

08:28.320 --> 08:30.402
Hmm.
Sounds like bullshit to me.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.808
Look, baby, I had
this whole thing planned.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.724
I did, and then I thought,

08:35.880 --> 08:39.929
well, who better to design
your party than... you?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.851
You'd hate what anyone else
put together anyway.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.088
You got me there.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.811
I already called Kantos.
You and LaKeisha go down tomorrow,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.651
get whatever you want,
invite whoever.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.161
Your husband's got you.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.766
Mm.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.366
- Thank you, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

08:59.360 --> 09:02.204
Okay, I promise
I won't break the bank, okay?

09:02.360 --> 09:04.249
Don't make no promises
you can't keep, woman.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.084
- I promise.
- Okay.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.525
They're really pushing the action

09:08.680 --> 09:11.684
here in the second round.
You see his cardio is holding on.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.524
You can't sleep?

09:13.680 --> 09:16.001
Something on your mind?

09:22.600 --> 09:23.931
Look.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.329
I know.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.164
It sucks to hear
your best friend

09:29.320 --> 09:30.890
is cheating
on your other best friend.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.245
Skanks throw themselves
at club owners all the time.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.925
He'll come back to his senses.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.003
Whatever.
I'm over that.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.764
I'm fine.
It's just work stuff.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.246
What time
are you gonna be home?

09:48.440 --> 09:50.408
I was thinking...

09:50.560 --> 09:53.484
I'd make you
some Cincinnati Chili.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.410
You know, over spaghetti,
with cinnamon?

09:57.560 --> 09:59.085
I bet you never had that.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.204
Sounds fucking disgusting.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.886
You...

10:05.080 --> 10:07.845
are gonna eat it and like it.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.247
Look, Holl, I...

10:11.680 --> 10:14.490
I might be a little late tonight.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.483
- How late?
- I...

10:18.480 --> 10:20.369
You can make that shit
for me another night.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.602
Another night?

10:22.760 --> 10:24.842
You like
having me around, huh?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.571
Yeah, I do.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.966
I gotta go shopping today anyway.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.929
I'll see what you got
in the kitchen.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.684
There ain't shit in there.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.043
This box of cereal
expired two years ago!

10:52.200 --> 10:53.531
Told ya.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.086
Tommy, what's this?

11:12.320 --> 11:13.481
Cash.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.722
No shit.

11:15.880 --> 11:19.282
Thank you for that
comprehensive explanation.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.124
From where?

11:21.320 --> 11:22.810
From the club.

11:22.960 --> 11:26.487
Bullshit it is!

11:26.640 --> 11:28.483
I don't like banks, that's all.
What's the problem?

11:28.640 --> 11:30.722
There are four more
of those in the kitchen.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.405
You are a bank.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.844
You shouldn't
be fucking snooping.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.924
Fuck you, Tommy.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.009
I told you not to fucking lie to me.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.041
Look at you, all G'd up.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.851
- You stacking?
- What? Nah, nah, nah.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.321
- Uncle G bought me this suit.
- Sign of respect.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.209
You must be stepping it up.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.169
Yeah, and maybe
when you get out in a year,

12:04.320 --> 12:06.288
you know...

12:06.440 --> 12:07.885
maybe I'll be somebody.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.525
Maybe.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.730
Hey, I hear motherfuckers
out there beefin'.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.526
Is it the Soldados,
the Taínos?

12:18.520 --> 12:20.249
- Um...
- It's okay.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.811
It's safe to talk here.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.691
- The Taínos got hit.
- Yeah?

12:26.840 --> 12:28.365
Yeah, and somebody
took Anibal out too.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.686
- No shit.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.410
And Ruiz got hit.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.045
Maybe in retribution
or maybe not,

12:33.200 --> 12:36.409
but I don't really know.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.483
Why you don't know?

12:38.640 --> 12:40.961
'Cause I don't ask no questions.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.964
Your Uncle G pulled you in,
so he expects you to ask questions.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.410
He expects you
to come to play, son.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.927
I'm just his driver.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.724
As long as you
see yourself as that,

12:51.880 --> 12:54.247
it's all you'll ever be.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.880
We all start off small, man.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.281
Runner, corner, cash kid.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.769
Question is, what are you
gonna make of yourself?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.731
- I'm working hard.
- That's good.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.689
But not good enough.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.925
How you supposed
to learn how G thinks

13:14.080 --> 13:17.801
if you don't know
his next move, hmm?

13:17.960 --> 13:20.088
I don't know.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.481
Yeah, I'm telling you.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.007
G waiting on you
to prove yourself.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.248
Show him you got the hustle.
Get in there.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.845
Take what's yours.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.243
Take what's yours.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.810
Please tell Mr. Stern
that I called to set a meeting.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.968
I bet he did forget your birthday.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.963
Now it's your chance
to make him pay.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.727
Let's put the manquarium
right here.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.928
Girl, what the fuck
is a manquarium?

13:48.080 --> 13:50.128
A giant fish tank
filled with men.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.645
You're out of your mind.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.804
- It's your 30th birthday.
- Exactly.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.281
And I want it
to be grown and sexy,

13:57.480 --> 13:58.766
but not with no ghetto-ass shit.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.161
Mrs. St. Patrick's right.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.806
I was thinking we can come up
with a birthday shout-out

14:03.960 --> 14:05.450
at the top of every hour.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.931
We can come up
with a signature cocktail

14:07.080 --> 14:09.890
or maybe even do
a balloon or a confetti drop.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.726
First of all,
she's turning 30, not 13,

14:13.880 --> 14:15.803
so enough with
the balloon stomping, all right?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.161
And make sure
there's plenty of Cîroc,

14:17.320 --> 14:18.810
because that's all my people drink,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.321
and no coconut
because I'm allergic to nuts.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.164
Thank you.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.923
- I really couldn't wait to see you.
- Yeah.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.845
I'm starting--
I'm starting to get distracted at work.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.240
It's bad.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.323
Not all bad.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.206
Hello?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.491
Yes, that's fine.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.802
I'll be right there.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.925
You okay?
Everything good?

15:04.080 --> 15:06.048
It's my father.
He's, uh...

15:07.200 --> 15:08.326
not well.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.244
I got to go.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.765
I can pay for the room
if you want.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.331
No, are you kidding?
I got the room.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.562
Don't worry about the room.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.563
He's out in Long Island.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.404
Got to get the train.

15:20.560 --> 15:24.406
Paz said he wasn't happy there,
and I should've listened.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.925
I could hear him screaming

15:26.080 --> 15:28.686
- in the background.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.571
He's gonna be okay.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.370
Look at me.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.887
He's gonna be okay, all right?

15:36.080 --> 15:38.367
My ride's downstairs.
I can take you.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.126
I want to take you.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.528
You're not listening!

15:46.560 --> 15:48.403
Why is that man in Mr. Williams' bed?

15:48.560 --> 15:50.642
Papi, papi.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.405
Angela!

16:07.400 --> 16:09.721
We're good here.
Thank you.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.765
You're safe here.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.684
Shh.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.888
The doctors are
looking out for you, papi.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.003
We all are.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.891
Paz will be by later, okay?

16:39.960 --> 16:42.611
That's my friend,
Jamie St. Patrick.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.285
He drove me here.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.801
The punk from the corner?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.166
The drug dealer?

16:48.360 --> 16:50.089
I thought I told you
to stay away from that boy.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.720
- He's no good.
- Pap-- papi, shh.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.161
Shh.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.767
He's finally asleep.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.724
It's so hard to believe
he's the same man

17:31.880 --> 17:34.850
that grilled me on spelling,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.241
grounded me
when I got a

17:37.400 --> 17:41.007
God, he could be an asshole sometimes...

17:43.800 --> 17:45.404
but now he's...

17:49.000 --> 17:53.050
He's helpless and so scared.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.364
I'm sorry.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.050
I'm a mess.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.089
Angie, is there
anything I can do?

18:13.880 --> 18:16.326
I don't think so,

18:16.480 --> 18:18.767
unless you can make
this all go away.

18:21.880 --> 18:22.927
This is Holly.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.487
Obviously I'm doing something
more important than taking your call,

18:25.640 --> 18:27.244
So leave a message.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.402
Hey, call me back.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.005
If I don't answer...

18:33.560 --> 18:34.925
never mind.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.251
Just call me.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.969
- Ruiz is expecting me.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.441
I've got a nine on my waist.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.130
And one on my ankle.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.845
Hold up.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.169
Oops, I must have forgot
about that one.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.641
- Who the fuck is you, Rambo?
- Can I go see your boss now?

19:52.840 --> 19:54.649
Come on.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.523
He's here to see jefe.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.126
- He clean?
- Yeah.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.481
All right.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.604
Yo. Yo, we got a visitor.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.128
You look like shit.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.122
I can't go to a regular hospital.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.328
Too many
fucking questions to answer.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.562
Gracias.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.563
Can we talk alone?

20:53.560 --> 20:55.722
They already patted me down,
took my gat.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.444
Nice of you to visit.
Where's Ghost?

21:36.760 --> 21:39.206
She won't let me fuck her in the ass.
Her sister will, though.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.085
I been stabbed twice.
I'd rather get shot.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.050
It wasn't us, Ruiz.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.049
- I heard different.
- We ain't got no beef with you.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.685
You're drug dealers.
You got beef with everybody.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.046
They say the same thing
about you.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.561
Maybe it was Anibal's people.
Maybe it was Rolla.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.007
Neither of those motherfuckers
got any love for you,

21:55.160 --> 21:59.131
and, really,
nobody else wants you dead?

21:59.280 --> 22:02.329
You're a drug dealer too, Ruiz.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.847
You got more enemies
than you even know.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.809
Look.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.290
If me and Ghost
was behind this hit,

22:12.440 --> 22:14.761
I wouldn't be here right now...

22:15.800 --> 22:17.962
and neither would you.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.969
Who's watching the elevator?

22:28.480 --> 22:30.721
Jefe wants somebody there all day.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.291
I got it.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.325
También.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.171
Yeah, right.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.891
You know how I ain't a bitch.
I'd like to look a motherfucker

22:49.040 --> 22:51.042
right in the eye when I do it
so he knows who got him.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.247
I give you that much.

22:55.960 --> 22:59.328
- Can you clean it up?
- Uh, fu-- uh, I don't know.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.243
Would you even know
if Ghost put out a hit on me?

23:09.400 --> 23:11.562
Your compai's been acting
kind of strange lately,

23:11.720 --> 23:13.927
going out of his way
to be all nice to me,

23:14.120 --> 23:16.202
but then not showing up
at meetings he arranges.

23:16.360 --> 23:19.045
With all this bullshit going on,
he's trying to keep a low profile,

23:19.200 --> 23:21.521
something you might
want to consider doing.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.283
Celebrating my High Holy Day
and this puta sticks me.

23:33.360 --> 23:36.045
The hitter was a girl?

23:36.200 --> 23:37.201
What'd she look like?

23:37.360 --> 23:40.569
She looked like ice cream and sunshine
till she stuck me.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.961
Great tits, beautiful ass,

23:43.120 --> 23:44.804
Latin girl, strong.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.564
A girl hit us too.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.449
Anything else you remember?

23:48.600 --> 23:51.080
I wasn't looking at her face, man.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.044
Light hair, curly.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.481
We find this girl,
we find out who's been hitting us.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.244
Oh, you're goddamn right, Ruiz.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.004
We in this together.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.366
I haven't been back here since I left.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.410
The bodega got replaced,
of course, with this pet store.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.887
But otherwise...

24:19.040 --> 24:21.520
just like the old days.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.522
I thought you could use
a milkshake.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.523
Hmm?

24:30.680 --> 24:32.887
You think they still make
black and whites?

24:33.040 --> 24:34.405
Why, that's why we here.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.131
Only one way to find out,
Miss Big-time.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.163
Oh.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.049
Just give me a second, baby.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.370
- What's up?
- Are you on your way in?

24:46.520 --> 24:48.648
No, I'm having lunch
out in Forest Hills.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.842
You just want to hear my voice?
What?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.126
Your wife's birthday...

24:52.280 --> 24:54.362
you sounded serious,
and I'm trying to make it work,

24:54.520 --> 24:57.126
but I'm gonna have to call in
more staff, pay overtime.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.520
That's fine.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.927
The other woman
wanted 20 cases of Cîroc.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.481
Yeah, whatever they need,
just do it. I gotta go.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.120
Wait, there's one more thing.
Simon Stern?

25:06.280 --> 25:08.931
Just make it happen.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.691
It's not easy, partner.
We all want the same thing here.

25:24.840 --> 25:25.921
We don't want any of this shit--

25:26.080 --> 25:27.809
Fuck are you doing?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.651
Just staying close
in case he needs something.

25:30.840 --> 25:34.003
I was the one who saved his life
while you were all rubbing asses.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.323
Who's the blanquito
in there with Ruiz?

25:37.480 --> 25:39.482
That's the guy
who gets us the products.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.409
Distro.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.167
I'm going in.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.721
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
You'll blow our cover.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.166
You want to call
your girlfriend

25:49.360 --> 25:50.771
and ask if you can pretty please
do your fucking job?

25:50.920 --> 25:52.001
You go for it, all right?

25:52.160 --> 25:53.605
I've been on this
case three years now.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.171
If Lobos' distributor's
in that building,

25:55.360 --> 25:58.204
- I'm getting a look.
- Son of a fucking bitch.

26:14.360 --> 26:16.362
Who would know a girl like that?

26:16.520 --> 26:18.727
Anibal's dead,

26:18.880 --> 26:20.848
I don't think Rolla would use
a female for wet work.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.480
- Lobos.
- No, Ghost don't think so.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.529
You, Ghost...

26:28.640 --> 26:30.847
have taken your eye off the ball.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.163
Nah, man.
We just waiting for our pitch.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.525
Now, I'm gonna find this bitch.

26:36.680 --> 26:39.047
I'm gonna make things right with us.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.729
I'ma find that girl.
Don't you worry.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.126
Yo, that's one crazy
motherfucker.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.442
Yo, yo, yo.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.965
One floor down, homie.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.722
- You feel better now?
- A little.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.370
But only because
of the milkshake.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.009
Mm.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.920
I gotta take this.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.531
Go ahead.
I understand.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.364
Everything cool?

28:51.520 --> 28:54.171
I'm still alive,
if that's what you mean.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.483
- Good, let's talk later.
- No, we need to talk now.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.041
I can't talk right now.
I gotta go.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.962
All right, you got
my undivided attention.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.249
Fuck.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.887
You've reached 347-555--

29:17.480 --> 29:19.130
Kantos, it's Tommy.
Where's your boss?

29:19.280 --> 29:21.203
Is he talking to some
club asshole over there?

29:21.400 --> 29:22.481
I thought he was having lunch with you

29:22.640 --> 29:24.165
out in Forest Hills.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.448
- He's in Forest Hills?
- That's what he said.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.090
Got off the phone in a hurry.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.768
- I'm sorry my dad said that...
- Ah.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.161
...about you being a punk,
a drug dealer.

29:47.320 --> 29:49.322
Yeah, he remembers
what he remembers, you know?

29:49.480 --> 29:51.084
He remembers wrong.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.971
You don't just
become a good guy, Jamie.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.885
To get where you are now means
you were always one inside.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.891
I was right about you all along.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.925
You're always
taking me someplace to eat

30:10.120 --> 30:11.610
like you're trying
to fatten me up or something.

30:11.760 --> 30:16.049
No, I just like the look on your face

30:16.200 --> 30:17.201
when something
gets real good to you.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.045
Mm, you must see that look a lot.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.446
No, it's different, though.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.568
It's your body and your smile

30:27.760 --> 30:29.967
and your mind,
the way you think.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.884
It's all of you.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.122
It's not what you are.
It's who you are.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.882
Look, Jamie...

30:40.320 --> 30:41.765
Mm-hmm, what?

30:41.920 --> 30:44.127
Do you want
to come over tonight?

30:44.320 --> 30:46.687
What about Greg?

30:47.800 --> 30:49.928
There is no more Greg.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.766
Hmm.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.241
No more hotels, okay?

30:56.280 --> 30:58.851
Okay.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.769
Thank you.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.850
Ahem, what are the odds?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.684
My God, Tommy.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.607
- How you doing, Angie?
- Not bad.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.290
- How about yourself?
- Look at you.

31:11.440 --> 31:14.569
I'm holding my own,
holding my own.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.002
Get me a black and white, large.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.561
I was just visiting
a sick friend of mine

31:20.720 --> 31:22.006
not too far from here.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.640
He sends his regards,
so I figured,

31:24.800 --> 31:26.211
why not pick up
the best black and white

31:26.400 --> 31:27.686
in New York on my way home?

31:27.840 --> 31:29.683
I thought you'd be at the club.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.330
What are you two doing
way out here?

31:31.480 --> 31:33.403
Oh, you know,
just catching up on old times.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.483
It seems like forever ago.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.722
I'll never forget the time
you tried to hook me up

31:37.880 --> 31:40.451
with your friend--
the hot one, Italian.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.807
Silvana,
she had a thing for you.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.843
Oh, not enough
to let me get to second base,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.890
and, trust me, I tried.
I got my hand up in there.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.451
She cancelled Christmas

31:49.600 --> 31:51.090
on your boy with a quickness.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.891
Kicked me right out
onto the street.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.929
You know who would love
these crazy stories

31:56.080 --> 31:58.526
about when we was kids?

31:58.680 --> 32:01.047
His wife, Tasha.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.288
Tomorrow night
we're having a big birthday party

32:04.480 --> 32:06.881
for her at the club.
You should come.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.644
I work late Thursdays.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.041
Aw, too bad.

32:11.240 --> 32:12.685
Another time.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.606
I'm gonna go.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.161
I don't want
your ice creams to melt.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.241
- Thanks.
- You got it.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.323
Thank you.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.369
- Call me later.
- You bet.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.925
I think I'm just gonna
catch the train back to the city.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.923
- Angie, I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what?

32:44.080 --> 32:46.845
That you're married?
That your best friend knows your wife?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.048
That he mentions her name
casually in conversation

32:49.200 --> 32:50.406
'cause he doesn't know
we're sleeping together?

32:50.560 --> 32:52.005
I'm sorry about Tommy.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.571
Forget about everything he said.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.404
Look, I want to be here with you...

32:56.680 --> 32:58.648
and later at your place.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.849
I'll call you, Jamie.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.650
We had a shot, and I took it.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.610
No, you jeopardized
the entire operation on your own.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.161
Who knows when or if we would've
had an opportunity like that?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.448
- And what if someone made you?
- Nobody made me.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.840
- You're sure about that?
- Positive.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.765
Because I know how to handle myself
on and off the field,

33:57.920 --> 33:59.445
unlike some of us in this room.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.005
Fuck you, Medina.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.606
I'll have Frankie
call your SAC over at the DEA,

34:03.760 --> 34:05.091
get you sent back
where you came from.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.163
Oh, really?

34:12.080 --> 34:15.322
Vaya.
Take it to Frankie.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.244
This way, um,

34:17.400 --> 34:20.529
I can get a few things
out in the open myself.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.603
Excuse me.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.125
I did the best I could
to keep him from going in.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.690
He didn't even get
a good look at the guy?

34:30.880 --> 34:32.609
No.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.885
I sent the audio to forensics
to see if they can clean it up.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.007
We should hear something
within 24 hours.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.810
Yeah, well, I'll be here.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.400
...reached Angela Valdes.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.005
I'm unable to take your call...

35:21.920 --> 35:23.604
So...

35:24.760 --> 35:26.762
lunch was nice yesterday.
How was the rest of the date?

35:26.920 --> 35:29.924
- None of your fucking business.
- That's funny since the other night

35:30.080 --> 35:32.082
you were all up in my business
about me seeing Holly.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.288
- When you get tired of this girl--
- I'm not gonna get tired of her.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.881
Okay, well, when you do,
she's gonna get fucking pissed.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.280
She's gonna fuck up
our whole club,

35:38.440 --> 35:39.771
the money,
every fucking thing, Tommy.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.082
You worried about me
fucking up the club?

35:42.280 --> 35:45.648
If Tasha ever found out
that you were nailing another broad,

35:45.800 --> 35:48.041
she'd blow up your family
and our whole fucking game.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.486
She'd take you to the cops

35:49.640 --> 35:51.608
just to see your
cheating ass rot in prison.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.285
First of all,
lower your fucking voice, man.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.124
Secondly, Tasha wouldn't
do that, and thirdly,

35:55.280 --> 35:57.203
she ain't gonna know shit
'cause you ain't gonna tell her shit.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.361
Oh, you're damn right
I ain't gonna tell her.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.806
That don't mean
she won't find out.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.008
I bet your phone
is full of texts from Angie

36:02.160 --> 36:04.128
and cute little voice messages.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.044
"So good to see you again
after all this time,

36:06.200 --> 36:08.123
after I broke your heart
and threw it in a fucking dumpster."

36:08.280 --> 36:10.601
- Forgot all about that, huh?
- It's different now.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.046
Yeah, you're married.
That's what's different now.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.804
Look, I got the whole
situation under control.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.530
Yeah.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.650
You always think
you got everything on lock.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.331
Ruiz says a girl stabbed him.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.847
Same as hit Liliana
and chased 'Bueso.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.809
Ruiz says it was
a Latina chick with nice tits

36:28.960 --> 36:30.166
and long, light-colored hair.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.368
Bet we could get a better description
if we could ask Liliana,

36:32.520 --> 36:35.808
but, whoa, my bad.
We can't, since we had her iced.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.244
Didn't know
I knew about that, huh?

36:39.400 --> 36:40.845
I been looking
at that bitch for weeks,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.331
waiting for you to say something.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.563
"Hey, Tommy,
I know we agreed to kill her,

36:45.760 --> 36:47.603
but I changed my mind."

36:47.760 --> 36:49.171
That would've worked.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.641
Thought she
was more useful alive.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.006
I made a judgment call.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.367
Now we can have Julio
go back to Liliana

37:02.520 --> 37:05.205
to see if Ruiz's description
lines the fuck up,

37:05.360 --> 37:07.010
- if she remembers anything.
- Yeah.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.204
We gotta find this girl, man,
and who she's working for.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.169
That's all that matters, Tommy.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.004
None of this other bullshit.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.566
Yo, G.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.204
Angela was trouble before,

37:25.360 --> 37:27.010
and she's trouble again.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.242
I just don't want
to see you get fucked up.

37:30.760 --> 37:31.886
That's all.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.283
Hi, Shawn,
we're almost ready.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.561
Mommy, you look beautiful.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.722
Yeah, that's a real nice dress,
Mrs. St. Patrick.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.166
Thank you both.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.727
Raina, have you seen
my diamond hoop earrings?

37:46.880 --> 37:49.406
No, I'm smart enough
to stay away from your stuff.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.166
But not smart enough
to figure out your fractions.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.481
Did you finish your homework, son?

37:53.640 --> 37:56.769
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Game off until you're finished, okay?

37:56.960 --> 37:59.008
- All right, let's roll out.
- Let me find my earrings first.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.969
Watch your mama
blame me for that somehow.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.407
- Join the club, Dad.
- Yeah.

38:03.560 --> 38:04.766
Shawn,
you went to visit your pops?

38:04.920 --> 38:06.729
- How'd it go?
- Yeah, he's good.

38:06.880 --> 38:07.927
I don't think
he's eating enough, though,

38:08.080 --> 38:10.082
so he's looking a lot leaner
and tighter from all the push-ups.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.049
- Tell him I sent my regards?
- Of course.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.247
And he sent his back, too.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.209
Cool.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.807
Can you tell my dad I'm old enough
for "Assassin's Creed" now, Shawn?

38:18.960 --> 38:20.041
What you trying to do, get me killed?

38:20.200 --> 38:21.440
Do your homework.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.008
- Did you find them?
- No.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.844
They'll pop up sooner or later.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.240
Come on, let's go.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.970
Okay, you two listen
to Big Mama, all right?

38:30.160 --> 38:31.491
- Okay.
- I'll see you in the morning.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.086
Good night, baby girl.
Take care of your sister.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.642
You want to keep that PS3,
you do your homework for real, now.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.848
- Good night, babies.
- Good night.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.164
How long you
gonna duck my calls?

38:59.320 --> 39:01.288
Until you're straight with me,
there's nothing to talk about.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.403
It's just fucking money.
Why do you care?

39:03.560 --> 39:04.971
I have it. Enjoy it.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.724
Tommy, if it was
about your money,

39:06.880 --> 39:09.008
I wouldn't be in these heels
and this slutty dress.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.521
I would be home on my night off.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.886
Kantos made you come in for this?

39:13.040 --> 39:15.042
Let me talk to that little bitch.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.170
Do you really not understand
why I'm mad at you?

39:18.320 --> 39:20.482
You're mad
because you don't believe me.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.802
But that's on you, all right?
That's not my problem.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.923
Then why are you
fucking calling me all day?

39:25.080 --> 39:28.641
You don't get to pick and choose
what part of your life you let me into.

39:28.840 --> 39:31.411
Look, Holly.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.769
I'm not lying to you, all right?

39:38.200 --> 39:40.168
- I got work to do.
- Holly!

39:51.400 --> 39:53.641
We want to give a big shout-out
to the first lady of Truth,

39:53.800 --> 39:55.928
Mrs. Tasha St. Patrick.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.771
Happy birthday, Tasha!

40:02.040 --> 40:05.681
Oh, my God.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.723
All right, let's make our way
over to VIP, all right?

40:07.920 --> 40:09.445
- Okay.
- All right.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.523
Special treatment,
here we go.

40:15.120 --> 40:17.282
- Quick thing.
- No business tonight.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.568
But this is the kind of business
you want to hear.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.484
Simon Stern called.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.085
He wants to meet.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.686
Tomorrow morning.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.330
Happy birthday, sis.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.960
- Thank you, Tommy.
- Mwah.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.202
Rather than give you money
like I always do,

40:32.360 --> 40:35.170
- figured I'd put some thought into it.
- What?

40:39.400 --> 40:41.641
Very nice, Tommy.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.928
You went to the spa to buy this?

40:44.080 --> 40:46.606
Hell, no, I know a guy
who knows a guy

40:46.760 --> 40:48.683
that had the hookup
to a real fancy joint

40:48.880 --> 40:50.405
with a sauna, Jacuzzi.

40:50.560 --> 40:53.086
Thought maybe you could
get a facial or some shit.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.765
You didn't have to do this,
Tommy.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.445
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I did.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.246
You supported us for so long,
always had our backs.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.606
You deserve the best.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.650
Tasha, Tasha!

41:05.920 --> 41:07.763
- Hi.
- Hey!

41:11.200 --> 41:13.043
What?

41:30.680 --> 41:33.081
I just want to say
happy birthday, Tash!

41:55.000 --> 41:56.126
I'll be right back.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.965
Oh.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.009
Hey, Tasha, I was just
about to come over

42:10.160 --> 42:11.321
and wish you a happy birthday.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.323
Where did
you get those earrings?

42:13.480 --> 42:15.050
These?

42:15.200 --> 42:16.645
You stole them
from my damn house.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.524
No, I didn't.

42:18.720 --> 42:21.007
Shut your lying ass up
and give me back my shit

42:21.160 --> 42:22.650
while you still have a job.

42:22.800 --> 42:26.282
Tasha, these aren't yours.
They're mine.

42:26.480 --> 42:28.801
Tommy bought them for me.

42:28.960 --> 42:32.248
Good, then he can
tell me that himself.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.681
Come on.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.486
- What's going on?
- Please tell her--

42:44.640 --> 42:46.290
You buy those earrings for her?

42:48.360 --> 42:50.647
Yeah, I bought 'em.
Why, you like 'em?

42:50.800 --> 42:52.006
I would've got you a pair too.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.003
Yeah, I do like them.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.890
They remind me of a pair
I used to have.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.407
Great minds think alike.

43:00.560 --> 43:03.370
Come on!
I got a surprise for you.

43:05.880 --> 43:08.201
Holly!

43:09.440 --> 43:10.680
Oh, just come on.

43:10.840 --> 43:12.126
Ladies and gentlemen!

43:12.280 --> 43:13.520
Ladies and gentlemen,

43:13.680 --> 43:15.170
I'd like to introduce
the lady of the hour,

43:15.360 --> 43:18.603
Mrs. Tasha St. Patrick,
to rock the mic.

43:18.760 --> 43:21.081
I'm not singing
at my own damn birthday party.

43:21.280 --> 43:24.011
- Why not? Beyoncé did it at hers.
- I'm not Beyoncé.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.201
You would be in her group
if she'd let you.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.885
Now, come on.
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

44:37.960 --> 44:41.407
Hey, I was beginning to think
your phone was broken.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.323
No, not broken.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.801
I told you I would call you.

44:46.960 --> 44:48.803
Well, I couldn't wait that long.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.726
You're at the party now?

44:51.880 --> 44:54.167
Yeah, but I'd rather be with you.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.561
I think you mean that.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.210
You're there
with all those people

45:01.360 --> 45:03.806
and I'm here alone.

45:03.960 --> 45:07.009
But I'm alone too, Angie.

45:07.160 --> 45:10.004
You know, yes, I mean,
there's a lot of people here.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.650
Most of them
are supposed to be my friends,

45:11.800 --> 45:13.689
but I'm alone
when I'm not with you.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.204
Can I come see you?

45:17.400 --> 45:19.528
You need to give me
some time, Jamie.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.529
Thanks.

45:38.680 --> 45:39.886
Thanks, everybody.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.884
Give it up for Tasha!

45:53.800 --> 45:55.643
Great party last night.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.086
How tired are you?

45:58.240 --> 46:00.288
I'm not.
I'm ready.

46:03.280 --> 46:05.089
Gentlemen, welcome.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.647
Thank you for venturing up here.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.609
Pleasure, sir.

46:09.760 --> 46:13.242
Ah, the elusive
James St. Patrick.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.448
Simon Stern.
Pleasure.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.681
Come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

46:19.760 --> 46:21.524
Here, have a seat.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.290
Let me cut to the chase.

46:27.440 --> 46:30.125
Cynthia Sheridan
took her business from me

46:30.280 --> 46:32.965
to come to you
and your club...

46:34.160 --> 46:35.889
- Truth.
- Truth.

46:36.040 --> 46:38.486
That vexed me a great deal.

46:38.640 --> 46:41.120
- It wasn't personal, sir.
- Of course not.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.442
But it made me think
either you're stupid

46:43.600 --> 46:45.329
and don't care about profit--

46:45.480 --> 46:49.405
because you basically gave
the whole cow away for free--

46:49.560 --> 46:53.724
or you're smart
and have something I don't.

46:53.880 --> 46:56.087
Other than
the Cynthia Sheridan parties?

46:59.560 --> 47:01.369
We have a full house every night,

47:01.520 --> 47:03.727
another 500 waiting out in the cold,

47:03.920 --> 47:06.810
two DJs on retainer,
a back entrance for celebrities.

47:06.960 --> 47:10.806
Something tells me
Simon knows our stats already.

47:10.960 --> 47:14.123
You're asking what makes us
more than just lightning in a bottle.

47:15.160 --> 47:16.446
You're right, I am.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.207
You're wanting to know
what I have to offer you.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.649
Well, you have
to make me an offer.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.643
I see.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.931
Holly! Holl.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.168
Yo, Holly!
Been looking all over for you.

47:41.320 --> 47:42.401
- Get in the car.
- Fuck you.

47:42.560 --> 47:45.609
You stole from Tasha
and I lied to cover your ass.

47:45.800 --> 47:48.485
Now get in the fucking car!

47:48.640 --> 47:50.768
What kind of fucking criminal are you?

47:50.920 --> 47:53.082
You owe me one now.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.641
Come on, get in the car.

48:04.120 --> 48:08.284
What the fuck you thinking,
stealing from Tasha, my family?

48:08.440 --> 48:09.885
I didn't think she would miss them.

48:10.040 --> 48:11.929
Her closet,
it's like a fucking department store.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.242
It doesn't matter
how much shit she has.

48:14.400 --> 48:17.802
She's like my sister. I told you that
before we went to their place.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.609
Look...

48:20.760 --> 48:22.489
I like to take shit.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.364
That's just who I am.

48:29.040 --> 48:31.008
I'm sorry, though.
It was a dick move.

48:31.160 --> 48:32.446
You can rat me out to her
if you want.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.121
Whoa, where you going now?

48:42.080 --> 48:44.731
All that money I found
in your place, Tommy...

48:44.880 --> 48:46.086
that's not from the club.

48:46.240 --> 48:48.004
No, it's not.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.641
But if you're gonna be my girl,
I got to be able to trust you, Holly.

48:54.720 --> 48:57.121
What I tell you, you...

48:58.120 --> 48:59.531
can't tell nobody...

48:59.680 --> 49:02.490
'cause nobody else knows.

49:02.640 --> 49:04.449
I want to know.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.606
The thing is...

49:10.800 --> 49:14.122
I sell some dope on the side
to make a little extra money.

49:14.280 --> 49:15.884
I'm a drug dealer.

49:17.640 --> 49:19.768
I'm not fucking stupid.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.445
Your phone isn't ringing
day and night.

49:21.640 --> 49:23.404
You don't live
in some shitty walk-up.

49:23.600 --> 49:27.082
And there's no way "some dope"
pays for a nightclub.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.163
Whatever you're doing
ain't your goddamn hobby.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.089
Tell me the truth, Tommy.

49:32.880 --> 49:35.042
I'm at the top of the food chain.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.163
I got a crew of motherfuckers
hustling for me,

49:37.320 --> 49:39.448
and we move serious weight.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.644
If I go away,
I go away for good.

49:54.600 --> 49:55.965
You wanted the truth.

49:57.960 --> 50:00.361
Yeah, I did.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.924
So what you think?

50:27.600 --> 50:29.602
I am a fucked-up thief

50:29.760 --> 50:32.809
and you are a crazy drug dealer.

50:33.800 --> 50:36.406
I think...

50:36.560 --> 50:38.847
you and I
were made for each other.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.887
- You're here.
- I'm here.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.925
Unannounced.

51:15.080 --> 51:16.923
I like the element of surprise.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.246
You said you and Greg are over.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.402
We are.

51:23.600 --> 51:24.931
So can I come in?

51:25.080 --> 51:26.445
I think that's a bad idea.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.842
I saw Simon Stern today.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.046
It went great.

51:34.200 --> 51:37.010
He wants to have dinner,
keep talking about a future.

51:37.160 --> 51:38.730
Congratulations, Jamie.

51:38.880 --> 51:41.406
I'm really happy for you.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.680
You're the first person
I wanted to tell.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.284
In fact, you're
the only person I wanted to tell.

52:38.680 --> 52:40.648
When I'm with you,

52:40.840 --> 52:43.002
I can't hold myself back.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.529
I want to.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.731
I want the reality to matter,

52:52.000 --> 52:53.525
but it doesn't.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.688
I just see you.

52:59.520 --> 53:02.000
I get wrong
when I'm away from you.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.767
I need another hit to get right.

53:10.560 --> 53:11.891
Another hit?

53:13.680 --> 53:16.365
That's exactly how it feels.

53:20.920 --> 53:23.082
Ah. Mm.

53:28.200 --> 53:30.771
I was so committed
to not seeing you,

53:31.920 --> 53:35.322
and then you just knock
on my door,

53:35.520 --> 53:37.204
and I let you in.

53:40.520 --> 53:43.330
A girl only has so much resolve.

53:44.560 --> 53:45.846
Sorry.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.764
No, you're not.

53:49.040 --> 53:51.088
What were you even
supposed to talk about anyway?

53:51.240 --> 53:53.208
Stern.

53:55.240 --> 53:56.765
My meeting.

53:56.960 --> 53:59.611
Tell me.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.449
Come on.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.045
Well, I don't want
to get ahead of myself,

54:05.200 --> 54:06.850
but we talked about partnering...

54:08.080 --> 54:10.242
expansion.

54:10.400 --> 54:11.845
Vegas, Miami.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.128
Mm, I like Miami.

54:30.240 --> 54:32.971
Sorry, babe.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.288
I know.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.969
I don't want you to go.

54:58.800 --> 55:00.165
I don't want to go.

55:06.160 --> 55:09.369
I mean, is there any way...

55:11.640 --> 55:13.642
could you stay the night?

55:23.000 --> 55:25.082
Never mind,
I know the answer.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.970
Reality calls.

55:28.120 --> 55:31.488
I wish I could, Angie.

55:31.680 --> 55:33.842
Hey;

55:37.120 --> 55:39.168
It won't always be like this.

55:41.400 --> 55:43.209
Yeah, okay.

55:43.400 --> 55:45.004
I promise.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.051
Okay.

55:52.240 --> 55:53.480
Thank you so much, Shawn.

55:53.640 --> 55:55.927
I hope you got a chance to enjoy

55:56.120 --> 55:58.202
some of the party the other night.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.647
Yeah, I did.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.211
Actually, um...

56:04.720 --> 56:06.484
I got you a little something myself.

56:06.640 --> 56:08.404
Shawn, you did not
have to do that.

56:08.560 --> 56:11.723
- You do enough already.
- Nah, it's just a little something.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.484
I hope it makes you smile.

56:20.880 --> 56:24.043
I heard you say you
lost a pair of earrings, so, um...

56:24.200 --> 56:26.362
They're b-beautiful.

56:27.440 --> 56:29.727
But I can't accept them.

56:29.880 --> 56:32.531
I wouldn't want Ghost
to get the wrong idea.

56:32.680 --> 56:35.843
Yeah.
Yeah, right.

56:37.960 --> 56:39.530
Excuse me?

56:41.640 --> 56:42.641
What was that?

56:42.800 --> 56:44.165
Shawn, what did you just say?

56:44.320 --> 56:46.084
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.561
I mean...

56:48.720 --> 56:52.361
you deserve someone
who's as loyal to you as you are to him.

56:53.680 --> 56:55.444
What the hell does that mean?

56:57.120 --> 57:00.363
He's always just
putting other stuff ahead of you.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.483
But what the hell do I know?

57:05.000 --> 57:06.923
I'm just the driver, right?

57:13.320 --> 57:15.926
I need men down
in the garage and at all the doors.

57:16.120 --> 57:18.122
Someone coming?

57:18.280 --> 57:19.611
Security needs to be tight.

57:19.760 --> 57:22.491
Who knows what this fucking
hijo de la gran puta has planned.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.085
Who?

57:24.240 --> 57:26.766
I'm expecting Ghost,
the pendejo who supplies us

57:26.960 --> 57:29.167
and most likely put
these fucking holes in me.

57:31.080 --> 57:33.560
...what this fucking
hijo de la gran puta has planned.

57:33.760 --> 57:35.091
Who?

57:35.240 --> 57:38.005
I'm expecting Ghost,
the pendejo who supplies us

57:38.160 --> 57:39.969
and most likely put
these fucking holes in me.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.282
- You want me to frisk him?
- What do you think?

57:42.440 --> 57:44.681
I tell you this piece of shit
tried to have me killed,

57:44.840 --> 57:46.604
and you're asking me if you should
see if he's carrying a weapon?

57:46.760 --> 57:47.966
What the fuck?

57:49.160 --> 57:50.764
...hijo de la gran puta has planned.

57:50.920 --> 57:53.161
- Who?
- I'm expecting Ghost,

57:53.360 --> 57:55.203
the pendejo who supplies us

57:55.360 --> 57:57.044
and most likely put
these fucking holes in me.

57:57.240 --> 58:01.006
You want me to frisk him?

58:01.200 --> 58:02.850
I'm expecting Ghost.

59:21.520 --> 59:29.520
