00:02.003 --> 00:03.743
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.838 --> 00:06.170
[Locke] I was in a wheelchair,
paralyzed for four years.

00:06.257 --> 00:08.999
This island, it changed me,
it made me whole.

00:09.093 --> 00:11.254
I'm so thankful for you, John.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.176
[Locke] You stole my kidney.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.505
You needed a father
and I needed a kidney.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.182
And that's what happened.
Get over it.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.679
I don't care what Jack said.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.182
They've got him.
We have to get him back. I owe him.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.185
- [Kate] How'd you get onto this island?
- On the submarine.

00:25.276 --> 00:27.983
Your people can just
come and go whenever they want?

00:28.070 --> 00:30.561
You never know when
a little C-4 might come in handy.

00:33.743 --> 00:35.153
Jack!

00:42.376 --> 00:45.243
- [woman] Name?
- [Locke] John Locke.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.003
Marital status, Mr. Locke?

00:48.799 --> 00:50.255
Uh, single.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.967
- Girlfriend?
- No.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.634
Are your parents living?

00:58.976 --> 01:02.343
l was raised in foster care.
I never really knew my parents.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.724
Have you ever considered
seeking out your biological parents?

01:08.694 --> 01:09.945
[stammering]

01:10.029 --> 01:11.735
I don't see how that's relevant.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.814
lt's relevant because
if the government's gonna continue

01:14.909 --> 01:16.774
paying your disability insurance,

01:16.869 --> 01:20.282
l have to figure out whether or not
your condition has improved.

01:26.712 --> 01:27.918
Fine.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.415
You stopped submitting
therapy bills for reimbursement.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.341
lt's 'cause I stopped going.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.462
Waste of time.

01:42.353 --> 01:44.935
It's just a temporary suspension.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.310
As soon as you resume your sessions,
you can re-apply.

01:48.401 --> 01:52.360
- You think I'm temporarily disabled?
- Depression can be temporary.

01:52.446 --> 01:56.359
Since you see fit to stop going
to therapy, I guess you're all better.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.567
- [papers shuffling]
- [desk drawer closes]

02:00.621 --> 02:01.997
Guess I am.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.373
Next.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.045
[people chattering indistinctly]

02:24.895 --> 02:27.181
- [man laughing]
- What is he doing?

02:30.067 --> 02:33.605
- [Friendly] Good hands!
' [man] I'll be right there.

02:33.696 --> 02:36.438
- [door opens]
- [Juliet] Jack!

02:42.413 --> 02:44.950
She's the one who helped
me and Sawyer escape.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.870
[whispering] It's gonna be tomorrow.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.760
- Hey, what?
- Danielle.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.889
[Kate] John, Rousseau's gone.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.331
[inaudible]

03:36.092 --> 03:38.128
[Ben talking indistinctly]

03:49.021 --> 03:52.184
[sighs] This is gonna be
more complicated than we thought.

04:11.794 --> 04:14.831
So we simply start shooting people
and hope for the best?

04:14.922 --> 04:18.380
- We came to rescue Jack.
- Obviously, circumstances have changed.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.880
- He may not want to be rescued.
- That is not him. That's not Jack.

04:21.971 --> 04:25.213
They did something to him.
When they captured us they drugged us.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.014
- He didn't appear to be drugged.
- They kidnapped him.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.433
He wouldn't forget that.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.387
I agree. Until we know why
we're putting our lives at risk.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.597
- I'm not leaving.
- We may not have a choice.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.353
lt's Jack.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.610
The first time I saw him,
he was risking his life,

04:40.698 --> 04:44.441
pulling people out
of burning airplane wreckage.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.527
If he's shaking hands with The Others,
he has a good reason.

04:47.621 --> 04:51.205
We just have to go down there
and find out what it is.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.456
- What do you suggest?
- Wait till dark.

04:56.547 --> 04:59.209
We approach Jack when he's alone.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.216
- And if he wants out, we get him out.
- [gun cocking]

05:04.513 --> 05:06.094
[woman] Here’s what we know.

05:06.182 --> 05:10.596
The Bolivian gold deposits were stolen
last night around 2:00 am.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.928
[woman 2] Autumn, that means
The Cobra, he's back!

05:14.023 --> 05:16.014
- [gunshots]
- [Autumn] Get down!

05:16.108 --> 05:17.723
[woman 2] Have you been shot?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.274
[Autumn] I can’t ﬁnd him.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.522
- [knocking]
- There. Behind Winged Victory.

05:21.614 --> 05:23.525
- I can see his arms.
- I can get him.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.530
Hello. John Locke?

05:29.622 --> 05:31.328
I'm sorry. No solicitors.

05:31.957 --> 05:35.245
- l have a sign.
- I'm not... I'm not trying to sell...

05:35.336 --> 05:37.918
Listen, my name's Peter Talbot.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.997
- Uh, ljust need to talk to you.
- Talk about what?

05:41.091 --> 05:43.252
My mother, actually.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.507
- I think she might be in some trouble.
- You got the wrong John Locke.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.589
How many kidneys do you have?

05:53.604 --> 05:55.515
[Peter] She met him two months ago.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.813
Love at first sight is what she said.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.937
The guy was charming, sweet, funny.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.276
His name's Adam Seward.

06:03.364 --> 06:06.356
He's a retired computer entrepreneur
from Ontario.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.361
Anyway, Adam had something special.

06:12.456 --> 06:15.198
My mom jut went ga-ga for him
right out of the gate.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.329
After two months of knowing him,
she agrees to marry the guy.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.877
- Something about him...
- [car alarm in distance]

06:20.965 --> 06:23.832
Something in my gut told me
that he was after something,

06:23.926 --> 06:25.917
sol... I had to check him out.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.842
I'm not sure I know what any of this
has to do with me.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.640
What this has to do with you, Mr. Locke,

06:33.727 --> 06:36.890
is that you donated one of your kidneys
to Adam Seward.

06:36.981 --> 06:40.894
Only his name was different back then.

06:40.985 --> 06:43.351
He used to be Anthony Cooper.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.113
[Peter] All I could find
were his medical records.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.744
And I saw he was the recipient
of a kidney transplant from you.

06:57.835 --> 07:02.625
So I figured, hey, if someone gave
the guy his kidney, how bad could he be?

07:04.341 --> 07:05.751
Right?

07:11.724 --> 07:15.057
Well, it was an anonymous donation.

07:15.144 --> 07:16.600
I never met him.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.934
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry. I can't help you.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.255
[both laughing]

08:00.064 --> 08:02.180
[indistinct murmuring]

08:10.157 --> 08:11.772
[Locke] Sayid, guard the front.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.734
l'll cover the back.
You head in through the side door.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.740
- I'm going in alone?
- Better if you're the first he sees.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.617
All right.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.683
[piano playing]

08:44.608 --> 08:46.269
[door creaking]

09:30.320 --> 09:31.605
[playing stops]

09:31.697 --> 09:33.403
[floorboards squeaking]

09:40.998 --> 09:42.238
Hi.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.494
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get you.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.580
Get out of here right now. Go.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.790
- Jack.
- Kate, they're watching me!

09:54.011 --> 09:55.842
- Get out.
- I'm not leaving you.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.261
- Get down.
- Don't hurt her. Don't hurt her.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.636
- Step back, Doc. Step back!
- [Kate grunting]

10:05.022 --> 10:07.013
- [Pryce] Hold him still.
- [Kate] Jack!

10:07.357 --> 10:10.269
- Jack!
- Who else is with you?

10:11.528 --> 10:14.144
[Kate panting]

10:15.407 --> 10:18.490
- Jack!
- Just answer the question, Kate.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.610
[Pryce] OK, one more time.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.288
Who else is with you?

10:30.047 --> 10:31.753
Nobody.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.297
Nobody else. It was just us.

10:40.307 --> 10:44.641
- [floorboards creaking]
- [door opening]

10:52.402 --> 10:54.563
[machine whirring]

10:59.409 --> 11:01.365
Alex?

11:07.584 --> 11:10.872
- John.
- Shh! Keep your voice down.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.329
All right.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.844
It's all right, John.
You don't have to point the gun at me.

11:17.928 --> 11:22.262
- I can tell you where Jack is.
- I'm not looking for Jack.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.476
I'm looking for the submarine.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.483
The submarine. Where is it?

11:35.571 --> 11:38.938
I'm not sure what you mean, John.
What submarine?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.899
The one you use to travel
to and from the island.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.863
The one your man Mikhail told me about
right before I killed him.

11:48.458 --> 11:52.042
- [Alex] Dad? Who are you talking to?
- Alex, don't come in here.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.709
- [muffled scream]
- Shh, shh!

11:56.800 --> 11:59.166
- Tell her to be quiet.
- Alex, please.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.594
- [Friendly] Ben, you awake?
- No, no!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.471
I'm coming in.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.929
[Ben] What is it?

12:13.025 --> 12:15.641
[Friendly] lt's Austen and Jarrah.
They're here.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.442
Somehow they found us.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.566
- Where are they now?
- We captured them.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.069
We're holding them at my place.
Want me to help you?

12:23.160 --> 12:25.822
No. Separate them.
I want to know how they found us.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.074
What about Juliet
and Shephard tomorrow?

12:28.165 --> 12:30.622
- [Ben] Let me worry about that. Go.
- Got it.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.951
- [Ben] Richard, wait a minute.
- I'll wait outside.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.626
I want you to bring me
the man from Tallahassee.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.550
- What do you need him for?
- Just do it.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.507
- Now.
- OK.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.648
[door closes]

12:57.694 --> 13:00.356
The man from Tallahassee?
What is that?

13:00.447 --> 13:01.778
Some kind of code?

13:01.865 --> 13:04.902
No, we don't have a code
for "there's a man in my closet

13:04.993 --> 13:06.904
with a gun to my daughter's head."

13:06.995 --> 13:09.862
Although we obviously should.

13:09.957 --> 13:13.290
Sayid, he had a pack with him.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.869
I want her to retrieve it.

13:17.923 --> 13:21.632
OK, but you should know, John,
my daughter currently hates me.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.460
I'm not sure holding me hostage
is your best option.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.589
Dad!

13:27.391 --> 13:28.597
I'll get your bag.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.191
[bell ringing]

13:40.278 --> 13:42.894
[woman] I'm looking for something
really stunning.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.198
Something that would grab
everyone's attention on the table.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.617
Honey, what do you think of this one?

13:50.539 --> 13:52.495
That looks good. What do you think?

13:52.582 --> 13:55.039
I like it. Maybe just a little larger.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.913
Yeah.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.925
Larger would be good.
Um, I'll go over there and take a look.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.391
Hello, John.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.641
Is there gonna be a big to-do,
orjust two of you and a preacher?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.890
I guess you couldn't invite me, huh?

14:19.985 --> 14:22.692
That would make
for awkward introductions.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.189
How did you know I was...?

14:24.281 --> 14:28.820
I know because her son came to me
and asked why I gave you a kidney.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.368
He's on to you,
but he doesn't have any proof,

14:32.456 --> 14:35.539
so he came to me,
hoping I would vouch for you.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.616
What did you say to him?

14:40.297 --> 14:42.083
You're conning her, aren't you?

14:43.341 --> 14:46.708
You're gonna marry her
for her money, right?

14:46.803 --> 14:50.091
- What is it you want, John?
- I want you to end it.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.348
I want you to call off the wedding.

14:54.352 --> 14:58.140
- Why are you doing this?
- Because. Because it's not fair.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.727
You make people think
that you're their family.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.979
And then you leave their life in ruins.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.733
And I'm not gonna let you do it again.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.357
You're gonna call off
your engagement and go,

15:11.369 --> 15:13.701
or I'm gonna tell her the truth.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.119
I want to hear you say it.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.077
You say you're gonna leave.

15:27.260 --> 15:31.503
OK, John. You got it.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.386
- [door opens]
- [bell on door ringing]

15:46.154 --> 15:48.861
Would you mind helping me
get into my chair?

15:51.159 --> 15:52.990
No tricks. I promise.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.116
[panting] | just want some dignity.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.539
You, of all people, should understand
what it means to want some dignity.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.548
Thank you.

16:16.977 --> 16:21.311
So, tell me, John, how do you expect
to pilot our submarine?

16:21.398 --> 16:23.684
It's a complicated piece of machinery.

16:23.775 --> 16:27.563
- You don't just press "submerge."
- l'll figure something out.

16:28.697 --> 16:32.281
For all you know,
I was a commander in the Navy.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.324
Put your arm around my neck
and I'll lift under your knees.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.406
What's in the pack, John?

16:42.210 --> 16:46.670
If you met Mikhail, that means
you were in the communications station.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.883
Which means you found the explosives.

16:51.261 --> 16:54.970
So you're not planning to pilot
the submarine anywhere, are you?

16:56.850 --> 16:58.590
You're planning to destroy it.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.808
I know you, John Locke.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.519
You don't know me at all.

17:10.614 --> 17:13.276
I know you were born in California.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.693
I know you were raised in foster care.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.574
I know you wasted a big part
of your life in Tustin,

17:20.665 --> 17:24.283
pushing papers at a company
that manufactured industrial boxes.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.496
You spent the four years prior
to your arrival on this island

17:29.591 --> 17:31.206
in a wheelchair.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.920
And I know how you ended up in it.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.095
Tell me, John,

17:45.857 --> 17:47.472
did it hurt?

17:55.784 --> 17:57.820
I felt my back break.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.119
What do you think?

18:07.337 --> 18:09.999
[door unlocking]

18:16.846 --> 18:19.223
- [grunting]
- [door opening]

18:27.190 --> 18:30.808
I didn't think
I'd see you again so soon, Kate.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.775
Be careful in here.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.606
Thanks.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.960
Did they hurt you?

19:00.724 --> 19:03.591
No. Did they hurt you?

19:03.685 --> 19:05.016
[sighs]

19:06.229 --> 19:07.685
No.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.354
What is all this?

19:15.155 --> 19:16.770
This is where they live.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.740
And the people they took?

19:21.995 --> 19:24.361
- The kids?
- They're all safe.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.540
Safe?

19:35.133 --> 19:37.294
So you're with them now?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.889
I'm not "with" anyone, Kate.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.634
What did they do to you?

19:48.229 --> 19:50.311
- Nothing.
- Why are you acting like this?

19:51.775 --> 19:53.185
There's no way...

19:53.902 --> 19:57.019
- There's no way I could...
- I came here to help you! Why...?

19:57.113 --> 19:59.650
I told you not to come back here for me!

20:01.409 --> 20:03.320
I didn't think you meant it.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.776
What did they do to you, Jack?

20:49.457 --> 20:51.163
I made a deal with them.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.200
They're gonna let me go.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.752
Where?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.214
Home.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.974
- When?
- First thing in the morning.

21:17.694 --> 21:22.233
- I'll bring help. It's our best chance.
- You trust these people? They're liars.

21:22.323 --> 21:25.065
I trust them
because you told me to, Kate.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.528
When you asked me to save Sawyer's life.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.543
Jack.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.289
What did they tell you?

21:43.303 --> 21:44.964
[door opens]

21:46.473 --> 21:49.135
Jack, we need to go.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.681
I'll be right there.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.522
| asked you not to come back here
for me and | wish...

22:08.328 --> 22:10.239
| wish that you hadn't.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.080
[whispering]
But I will come back here for you.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.108
[turns off engine]

22:50.036 --> 22:52.027
[humming]

22:53.081 --> 22:54.946
- John Locke?
- Yeah.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.282
Detective Mason.
That's Detective Reed.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.493
Do you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

22:59.587 --> 23:03.079
- No, of course not.
- Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?

23:06.386 --> 23:09.719
- No, I don't think so.
- Thin, brown hair, 20's.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.931
If it will be helpful we believe
he was in your apartment two days ago.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.599
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

23:15.687 --> 23:19.100
Yeah, he was a solicitor.
[stammers] I sent him away.

23:19.190 --> 23:23.854
Mr. Talbot's family's worth somewhere
in the neighborhood of $200 million.

23:23.945 --> 23:26.982
So I'm curious. What exactly
was he selling you door-to-door?

23:27.073 --> 23:29.314
Look, I told you I don't know him.

23:29.409 --> 23:32.822
Why was your name and address
on a piece of paper in his pocket?

23:35.164 --> 23:37.871
Why would you be looking
through his pockets?

23:38.459 --> 23:40.450
Because Peter Talbot's dead.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.795
It wasn't easy, you know.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.431
Being in that hatch with you
all that time.

23:52.515 --> 23:55.427
Knowing you had no business
walking around.

23:55.518 --> 23:59.557
Knowing I couldn't ask you about it
without telling you who I really was.

23:59.647 --> 24:02.605
- So ask me now.
- [curtains closing]

24:03.526 --> 24:05.892
Now that I know who you really are.

24:10.199 --> 24:13.407
Was it immediate?
It started the moment you got here?

24:15.413 --> 24:17.074
- Yeah.
- And you were walking?

24:17.165 --> 24:19.451
The feeling returned
right after the crash?

24:19.542 --> 24:22.158
That's what "immediate" means, Ben.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.997
You're wondering
why it hasn't happened for you.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.754
You're not recovering
as fast as you'd like.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.930
How long's it been
since Jack fixed you? A week?

24:36.893 --> 24:40.761
Now that I think about it,
how did you get sick in the first place?

24:40.855 --> 24:45.724
Are you afraid it will go away, John?
Is that why you want to destroy the sub?

24:45.818 --> 24:50.027
Because you know if you ever leave
this island you'll be back in the chair?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.948
You got anything to eat?

25:01.250 --> 25:03.036
[footsteps approaching]

25:14.097 --> 25:19.512
Hey. Go on home, kid. You know
you're not supposed to be here.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.638
My father sent me to get his pack.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.518
VVhy?

25:26.609 --> 25:28.850
I don't know why,
but he told me to get it.

25:29.862 --> 25:33.400
All right. [grunting] Here you go.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.278
You're Alex, aren't you?

25:41.165 --> 25:42.905
Hey, can it.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.867
How do you know my name?

25:45.962 --> 25:48.294
Because you look like your mother.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.290
My mother is dead.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.256
I'm sure that's what they told you.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.880
[grunting]

25:58.975 --> 26:00.340
Get going, Alex.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.603
Keep your mouth shut.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.901
Where do you get electricity?

26:19.996 --> 26:23.659
We have two giant hamsters running
in a massive wheel at our secret lab.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.331
That's funny.

26:26.002 --> 26:29.210
There's leftovers in the refrigerator.
Help yourself.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.806
I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.

26:45.688 --> 26:50.899
Mmm. I never really... appreciated
chicken until right now.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.148
I know you think
you need to do this, John,

26:55.239 --> 26:58.697
but if you blow up my submarine
l have a big problem with my people.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.447
Is that supposed to be an incentive
not to blow it up?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.872
l was born on this island.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.950
Not many of my people can say that.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.457
Most of them were recruited
and brought here.

27:11.547 --> 27:15.586
As much as they love this place
or would do anything to defend it,

27:15.676 --> 27:18.338
they need to know they can leave
if they want to.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.429
The sub maintains that illusion.

27:22.517 --> 27:26.476
- So you're lying to them.
- They're here because they want to be.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.804
Some of them are just not ready
to make a full commitment yet.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.398
But you, John...

27:33.694 --> 27:34.649
[water running]

27:34.737 --> 27:38.446
...you've already made that commitment
and now you have a choice.

27:38.533 --> 27:42.071
Because if you stop and if you think,
I can show you things.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.995
Things I know you want
to see very badly.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.828
Let me put it so you'll understand.

27:53.381 --> 27:54.917
Picture a box.

27:56.217 --> 27:58.833
You know something about boxes,
don't you, John?

27:58.928 --> 28:01.544
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island

28:01.639 --> 28:04.301
there's a very large box?

28:05.226 --> 28:09.060
And whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

28:09.146 --> 28:12.889
when you opened that box,
there it would be.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.610
What would you say about that, John?

28:21.075 --> 28:25.364
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

28:28.833 --> 28:32.701
- Why are you so angry?
- You're cheating. You and your people.

28:32.795 --> 28:36.003
Communicate with the outside world
whenever you want to,

28:36.090 --> 28:37.955
you come and go as you please,

28:38.050 --> 28:40.666
you use electricity
and running water and guns.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.092
You're a hypocrite.

28:42.179 --> 28:45.216
A Pharisee.
You don't deserve to be on this island.

28:45.308 --> 28:50.052
If you had any idea
what this place really was,

28:50.146 --> 28:53.183
you wouldn't be putting chicken
in your refrigerator!

28:53.274 --> 28:56.858
You've been here 80 days, John.
I've been here my entire life.

28:57.820 --> 29:01.358
How is it that you think you know
this island better than I do?

29:01.449 --> 29:04.156
Because you're in the wheelchair...

29:05.036 --> 29:06.242
...and I'm not.

29:21.218 --> 29:22.674
[door opens]

29:24.347 --> 29:26.133
Did you have any problems?

29:32.605 --> 29:34.470
OK, here's how this is gonna work.

29:34.565 --> 29:37.557
She's gonna take me to the sub.
Once we're there I let her go.

29:37.652 --> 29:39.608
She's done enough.
Let me take you.

29:39.695 --> 29:42.027
I don't want you to slow me down.

29:42.865 --> 29:44.696
Come on, let's go.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.779
John, before you go you should know...

29:47.870 --> 29:49.451
Jack and I made a deal.

29:51.165 --> 29:54.202
In less than an hour
he's leaving this island on that sub,

29:54.293 --> 29:55.749
and it's a one-way ticket.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.043
The anomaly wiped out
our communications.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.621
We have no way of contacting
the outside world.

30:01.634 --> 30:05.843
Which means when that sub leaves,
it can never come back.

30:06.555 --> 30:10.514
Whether you destroy the sub or
let it go, the end result is the same.

30:11.686 --> 30:13.677
No one will find this island.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.725
Let's go.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.854
Come on.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.988
[Alex] You know
he's manipulating you, right?

30:26.075 --> 30:27.281
How's that?

30:27.368 --> 30:30.201
That's what my father does.
He manipulates people.

30:30.705 --> 30:33.321
He makes you think it's your idea,
but it's his.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.748
I'll have to keep that in mind.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.094
The submarine's down there.
At the end of the dock.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.299
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.792
[hatch door opens]

32:04.131 --> 32:05.871
[door closing]

32:05.966 --> 32:08.708
Look, I know you don't owe me anything.

32:08.803 --> 32:11.340
But I need to ask you
for one last favor.

32:17.478 --> 32:19.434
You don't knock?

32:22.525 --> 32:24.356
I need you to let my friends go.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.060
After I'm gone.

32:27.154 --> 32:30.271
And if I said no,
would that stop you from leaving?

32:30.366 --> 32:32.027
Of course it would.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.954
Your friends are only here
to rescue you.

32:39.041 --> 32:42.329
But you seem to be doing a good job
of rescuing yourself, so...

32:45.965 --> 32:48.923
...I suppose there's no reason
to keep them here.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.421
Do l have your word on that?

32:54.723 --> 32:56.054
You have my word.

32:57.226 --> 33:00.639
I'll let them go
just as soon as you've left the island.

33:09.822 --> 33:11.858
Well, I guess this is it.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.235
Thank you, Ben,

33:19.248 --> 33:21.534
for keeping your promise.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.924
[door closing]

33:57.912 --> 33:59.868
Hey, hold it right there.

33:59.955 --> 34:02.287
Get your hands up.
Get down!

34:02.374 --> 34:04.365
I said get down.

34:15.095 --> 34:17.552
What are you doing here, John?

34:17.640 --> 34:19.972
I'm sorry, Jack.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.518
Sorry for what?

34:24.605 --> 34:25.811
[indistinct shouting]

34:46.835 --> 34:49.326
[banging]

34:50.923 --> 34:52.914
- What did you do?
- John.

34:53.509 --> 34:55.591
Tell me. Tell me you didn't do it.

34:55.678 --> 34:59.011
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me you didn't kill that kid.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.764
What? You think I had something
to do with Peter's death?

35:02.851 --> 35:06.014
| tell you to end things with his mother
and then he's dead.

35:06.105 --> 35:09.017
John, calm down, please.
Think about what you're saying.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.349
- Why would I kill Peter?
- He was on to you.

35:11.443 --> 35:15.277
I've been doing this for a long time.
I'm not sweating some rich kid.

35:15.364 --> 35:16.945
- Why are you still here?
- What?

35:17.032 --> 35:19.774
| tell you to leave.
You tell me you're gonna leave.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.120
Why are you still here?

35:22.204 --> 35:25.287
Listen, John, I'll be honest with you.

35:26.125 --> 35:29.743
I didn't end it.
l was looking for an angle.

35:29.837 --> 35:32.419
I wanted to make some money
before I skipped out.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.121
But then all this happened.

35:34.216 --> 35:37.629
Peter died and everything
just went straight into the tank.

35:39.555 --> 35:41.637
She's devastated.

35:41.724 --> 35:43.464
She's called off the wedding.

35:43.559 --> 35:46.141
There's no profit in it, John.

35:46.228 --> 35:48.970
I'm a con man, not a murderer.

35:51.734 --> 35:53.565
She called off the wedding?

35:54.987 --> 35:57.023
She said she couldn't deal with it.

35:57.823 --> 36:01.441
- She needs to be alone.
- So if I were to call her right now,

36:01.535 --> 36:04.743
that's what she would tell me?

36:06.123 --> 36:08.079
Phone's right over there, John.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.083
What's her number?

36:16.175 --> 36:17.540
[screaming]

36:20.512 --> 36:22.423
[glassjingling]

36:25.434 --> 36:28.972
[Mason] Mr. Locke, we know
this isn't what you want to hear,

36:29.063 --> 36:30.928
but your father's gone.

36:31.648 --> 36:34.890
We know he fled to Mexico
shortly after your encounter,

36:34.985 --> 36:37.101
then he disappeared.

36:37.654 --> 36:40.817
I'm sorry, but he could be
anywhere in the world right now.

36:43.327 --> 36:47.240
All right, detectives. That's enough.
Mr. Locke has work to do today.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.741
We'll let you know if anything develops.

36:51.835 --> 36:55.828
John, John, John.
We have got ourselves

36:55.923 --> 36:57.914
quite a day ahead of us, my friend.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.131
A fine time to get you out of bed.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.551
No, I don't want to.

37:02.638 --> 37:05.254
I don't remember asking.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.137
Now, most people struggle
with this at first.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.565
But don't worry.
You'll get used to it.

37:18.821 --> 37:20.857
No, no, please.
I can't do this.

37:20.948 --> 37:24.566
John, you fell eight stories
and survived, OK?

37:24.660 --> 37:27.823
I don't want to hear about
what you can't do. Let's go.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.744
- It's gonna be all right.
- No... no...

37:29.832 --> 37:31.788
It's gonna be fine, John. Come on.

37:34.670 --> 37:36.831
[grunting, panting]

37:38.799 --> 37:40.380
You're fine.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.463
Here we go.

37:43.554 --> 37:45.510
There you go, buddy.

37:48.892 --> 37:53.261
That wasn't that bad, was it?
I'll be right back, buddy.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.728
[sobbing]

38:28.182 --> 38:30.514
[sighs]

38:30.601 --> 38:33.092
Well, John, you've really
gone and done it now.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.722
You don't have to pretend
to be disappointed anymore.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.273
We both know you wanted it to happen.

38:41.403 --> 38:43.735
That's why you left the C-4
in Sayid's bag,

38:43.822 --> 38:46.734
because you wanted me
to make it happen.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.904
Uncuff him, please, Richard.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.832
You gonna do anything stupid?

38:58.962 --> 39:00.122
No, sir.

39:05.636 --> 39:08.753
Do you remember earlier,
when you called me a cheater?

39:09.598 --> 39:13.136
When you said I didn't deserve to live
on this island? Well, get this.

39:13.227 --> 39:15.843
There l was, shaking hands with Jack,

39:15.938 --> 39:20.352
and thinking I'd give almost anything to
come up with a way to stop him leaving.

39:20.442 --> 39:24.811
Because to let him go would be a sign
of weakness, of failure, of defeat.

39:24.905 --> 39:27.988
My people would see that.
They would know it.

39:28.075 --> 39:30.191
And that, John, would be the end of me.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.900
But to kill him...

39:33.747 --> 39:35.612
That would be cheating.

39:35.707 --> 39:39.575
Because my people also heard me
make a promise, and to break my word,

39:40.837 --> 39:43.214
that would be the end of me too.

39:46.343 --> 39:50.302
And then you came
striding out of the jungle, John.

39:52.307 --> 39:55.174
To make my dream come true.

39:57.646 --> 40:01.230
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again, are you?

40:03.318 --> 40:04.899
No, John.

40:04.987 --> 40:07.444
I'm gonna show you what came out of it.

40:19.835 --> 40:22.827
When I asked you if it hurt
when you suffered your injury,

40:22.921 --> 40:26.254
I think you misunderstood me.
It seems fairly obvious

40:26.341 --> 40:30.835
when a person's back smashes
after being thrown from a building,

40:30.929 --> 40:32.920
that's gonna sting a little.

40:33.015 --> 40:36.052
But I really wasn't asking
about the physical pain.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.684
You want to know if it hurt my feelings?

40:38.770 --> 40:40.101
No, John.

40:40.188 --> 40:44.181
I wanted to know what it felt like
when your own father tried to kill you.

40:47.321 --> 40:50.279
He's the reason
you destroyed the submarine, isn't he?

40:51.617 --> 40:53.153
You're afraid.

40:53.243 --> 40:56.701
You're afraid of him and this is
the one place he can never find you.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.531
- The one place he can never get to.
- What do you want from me?

41:03.712 --> 41:06.124
I don't know how it happened.

41:07.049 --> 41:11.292
But you seem to have some communion
with this island, John,

41:11.386 --> 41:14.469
and that makes you very, very important.

41:15.182 --> 41:17.423
You have no idea
what you're talking about,

41:17.517 --> 41:20.884
but in time you'll have
a better understanding of things.

41:22.439 --> 41:24.270
So, what do I want?

41:25.192 --> 41:26.898
I want to help you, John.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.318
VVhy?

41:31.573 --> 41:34.440
Because I'm in a wheelchair
and you're not.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.410
Are you ready to see?

41:49.591 --> 41:51.377
[keys jingling]

42:23.333 --> 42:25.369
Dad?
