00:54.187 --> 00:56.348
<i>I saw this image when I was a kid.</i>

00:57.608 --> 01:01.692
<i>The photograph of Jupiter
taken by NASA's Voyager.</i>

01:01.778 --> 01:04.110
<i>Beautiful,</i>

01:04.197 --> 01:07.360
<i>but nothing special
until shown in rapid succession.</i>

01:10.912 --> 01:14.370
<i>Suddenly Jupiter was alive,</i>

01:14.458 --> 01:15.789
<i>breathing.</i>

01:17.377 --> 01:19.368
<i>I was hypnotized.</i>

01:35.187 --> 01:38.600
<i>I was 17 when I got
my acceptance letter to MIT.</i>

01:38.690 --> 01:40.476
- One, two, three, MIT!
- Okay. Wait...

01:41.902 --> 01:44.985
<i>I felt like anything was possible.</i>

01:45.072 --> 01:48.530
I don't want to eat
the apple of cynicism.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.738
<i>And it was.</i>

02:14.059 --> 02:17.430
<i>- # Flava #
- # Flava #</i>

02:17.521 --> 02:20.763
<i>Yo, what's up, baby?
It's your boy Flava... F-L-A-V-A.</i>

02:20.857 --> 02:23.599
<i>That's your dude
with the big mouth! Yo!</i>

02:23.694 --> 02:26.231
<i>I don't know if you heard the news,
but the scientists say...</i>

02:26.321 --> 02:29.358
<i>they just discovered
another planet super close to us...</i>

02:29.449 --> 02:31.986
<i>with the conditions
that could support life?</i>

02:32.077 --> 02:36.036
<i>Really? Well, now it's visible
up in the night sky.</i>

02:36.123 --> 02:40.162
<i>They say if you look just east
of the North Star, you'll see it.</i>

02:40.252 --> 02:41.867
<i>It's a little blue spot.</i>

02:41.962 --> 02:45.045
<i>I want all you lovers out there
to make a wish...</i>

02:45.132 --> 02:46.997
<i>on a tiny blue star...</i>

02:47.092 --> 02:50.334
<i>as I play this hot joint for you
right now.</i>

02:50.429 --> 02:53.262
<i>It's your boy Flava!</i>

03:03.942 --> 03:04.897
That's easy.

03:04.985 --> 03:08.603
What rhymes with... "honey"?

03:08.697 --> 03:10.187
"Bunny. "

03:10.282 --> 03:12.238
He's like,
"All right, enough with it!"

03:12.325 --> 03:14.361
What rhymes...
Let's do some animals.

03:14.453 --> 03:16.034
- You wanna give him some animals?
- Yeah.

03:16.121 --> 03:19.454
- What rhymes with...
- "Lion"?

03:19.541 --> 03:21.247
Oh, my gosh.

03:21.376 --> 03:23.742
- "Pion. "
- A pion.

03:23.837 --> 03:28.001
A small puma of the high Himalayas.

03:28.091 --> 03:30.332
Did we figure out
what this guy's name is?

03:32.220 --> 03:34.131
- Bob.
- Bob the robot.

03:34.222 --> 03:35.803
He looks to me like a Bob.

03:35.891 --> 03:37.506
Go ahead.

03:38.477 --> 03:40.809
Feel her.

03:40.896 --> 03:42.636
She's in there, all right.

03:42.731 --> 03:44.562
I hope so.

03:46.651 --> 03:50.644
What rhymes with...

03:50.739 --> 03:51.899
"light"?

03:51.990 --> 03:53.855
- "Light"?
- Oh, that's a good one.

06:00.869 --> 06:03.235
<i>And by all appearances, the, uh, planet...</i>

06:03.330 --> 06:04.945
<i>seems to be a mirror to our own,</i>

06:05.040 --> 06:07.452
<i>from the continental structures
to the oceans.</i>

06:07.542 --> 06:09.999
<i>Even their cities are our cities.</i>

06:10.086 --> 06:12.077
<i>And where are we in terms of communication?</i>

06:12.172 --> 06:13.753
<i>That's exactly my point.</i>

06:13.840 --> 06:15.751
<i>If this planet is sustaining
intelligent life...</i>

06:15.842 --> 06:17.332
<i>of comparable
levels to our own...</i>

06:17.427 --> 06:18.917
<i>That's a very significant point.</i>

06:19.012 --> 06:21.344
<i>So far we have nothing.
We have a jumble of radio signals,</i>

06:21.431 --> 06:23.262
<i>the strongest of which
are military radars.</i>

06:23.350 --> 06:27.218
<i>But even those radio signals are not
something we can parse out and understand.</i>

06:27.354 --> 06:29.595
<i>We don't
even know it really exists.</i>

06:29.689 --> 06:32.351
<i>It could be some
cosmic mirror of sorts.</i>

06:32.442 --> 06:34.683
<i>You've written
extensively about that...</i>

06:34.778 --> 06:38.896
<i>as the most likely explanation for why it's
identical to our own planet.</i>

06:38.990 --> 06:40.651
<i>This planet exists.</i>

06:40.742 --> 06:43.905
<i>It has mass and it has
a clearly detectable orbit.</i>

06:43.995 --> 06:46.361
<i>It's even having radio signals.</i>

07:25.870 --> 07:28.657
So did you have a crew
on the inside?

07:28.748 --> 07:30.534
Do you have any tattoos?

07:30.667 --> 07:32.407
- Jeffrey!
- I'm just taking.

07:38.633 --> 07:42.342
You hear about that guy who's having
the contest to go to the other Earth?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.215
I mean, it's so stupid.

07:44.305 --> 07:48.264
They're gonna get sucked
into a black star and die.

08:28.933 --> 08:30.389
Hmm.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.517
Is it good to be home?

08:36.857 --> 08:37.847
Yeah.

08:37.942 --> 08:40.524
You know,
if you need anything...

08:46.576 --> 08:48.737
Oh. Towels.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.828
Night.

08:54.626 --> 08:56.207
Good night, Mom.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.314
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

09:19.400 --> 09:21.982
<i>Booster ignition, and liftoff.</i>

09:22.070 --> 09:24.857
<i>This will be
a trip like no other.</i>

09:24.948 --> 09:29.863
<i>We will give those that travel with us
a unique and life-changing experience.</i>

09:29.953 --> 09:33.116
<i>Travel to Earth Two.
Now booking.</i>

10:36.811 --> 10:39.974
I was thinking I would like
to do something with my hands.

10:40.064 --> 10:43.522
You know, maybe...
maybe outdoors, maybe not.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.352
Come on. I mean, you could
do something with your hands,

10:46.446 --> 10:50.280
but you have
such a great mind.

10:50.366 --> 10:55.201
I don't wanna really be around too
many people or do too much talking.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.155
All right.

11:01.127 --> 11:04.790
Well, there's a maintenance position
open at West Haven High School.

11:13.389 --> 11:17.803
<i>Just imagine that you're asleep
and then you wake.</i>

11:17.894 --> 11:19.555
<i>You're not sure where you are.</i>

11:19.646 --> 11:21.853
<i>You're not sure
if anyone else is around.</i>

11:21.940 --> 11:23.976
<i>What would you probably do first?</i>

11:24.067 --> 11:28.151
<i>You likely would look around
and say, "Hello?</i>

11:28.238 --> 11:29.728
<i>Hello?"</i>

11:29.822 --> 11:32.985
<i>You're attempting to find,
"Am I alone?"</i>

11:33.076 --> 11:35.658
<i>We here on Earth
would like to know.</i>

11:35.745 --> 11:38.327
<i>Me and Rob got into this huge,
stupid fight last night.</i>

11:38.414 --> 11:40.029
Really? About what?

11:40.124 --> 11:42.365
I don't know. We were hanging
out, and he just started fighting...

11:42.460 --> 11:43.825
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

11:43.962 --> 11:46.964
- What are you guys doing?
- Um, skipping Chemistry.

11:46.965 --> 11:48.921
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.839
Guess who just texted me.

11:53.930 --> 11:54.919
- Who?
- Kyle.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.299
Is he gonna pick us up?

12:00.103 --> 12:02.936
<i>Yo! It's the winter solstice.</i>

12:03.022 --> 12:05.263
<i>That's right.
The shortest day of the year,</i>

12:05.358 --> 12:09.897
<i>which means it will also be
the longest night of the year.</i>

12:09.988 --> 12:12.400
<i>So take advantage.
You know what I'm talking about.</i>

12:12.532 --> 12:18.619
<i>Also, today marks the anniversary of the
discovery of Earth Two a few years back.</i>

12:18.705 --> 12:20.787
<i>Can you remember
what you were doing that night?</i>

12:20.873 --> 12:22.283
<i>I know I remember.</i>

12:22.375 --> 12:26.288
<i>I met this girl from Bridgeport...</i>

12:26.379 --> 12:28.461
<i>that had a thing for the Flava!</i>

12:28.548 --> 12:30.630
<i>That's right, baby.
You know how we do.</i>

12:30.717 --> 12:33.754
<i>Baby, if you're still out there,
boo, holler at your boy.</i>

12:33.845 --> 12:35.961
<i>Flava, F-L-A-V-A. Yeah.</i>

12:36.055 --> 12:38.262
<i>Not only do I got a big mouth,
I got a... Uh.</i>

12:38.349 --> 12:40.180
<i>You know my number.
Call me. Mmm.</i>

16:47.848 --> 16:51.090
<i>...company that's
underwriting civilian travel to Earth Two.</i>

16:51.227 --> 16:53.388
<i>Keith, with all the risks...</i>

16:53.479 --> 16:56.437
<i>and all the unknowns,
why are you doing this?</i>

16:56.524 --> 16:59.106
<i>I don't think governments
should dictate exploration.</i>

16:59.193 --> 17:02.401
<i>And I don't think we should
automatically ban average citizens...</i>

17:02.488 --> 17:05.776
<i>from being the first to see
this new world.</i>

17:31.851 --> 17:35.435
<i>When early explorers first
set out west across the Atlantic,</i>

17:35.521 --> 17:38.888
<i>most people thought
the world was flat.</i>

17:38.983 --> 17:43.067
<i>Most people thought
if you sailed far enough west,</i>

17:43.154 --> 17:45.691
<i>you would drop off a plane
into nothing.</i>

17:48.117 --> 17:51.109
<i>These vessels sailing out
into the unknown...</i>

17:51.203 --> 17:56.914
<i>they weren't carrying noblemen
or aristocrats, artists, merchants.</i>

17:58.836 --> 18:03.421
<i>They were crewed by people
living on the edge of life...</i>

18:03.507 --> 18:08.843
<i>the madmen, orphans,
ex-convicts, outcasts...</i>

18:08.929 --> 18:10.544
<i>like myself.</i>

18:14.101 --> 18:17.764
<i>As a felon, I'm an unlikely
candidate for most things.</i>

18:20.358 --> 18:22.849
<i>But perhaps not for this.</i>

18:25.112 --> 18:27.569
<i>Perhaps I am the most likely.</i>

19:01.315 --> 19:02.896
Rhoda?

19:02.983 --> 19:04.598
Hi. Alex.

19:07.238 --> 19:09.069
I know who you are.

19:09.156 --> 19:11.488
How are you?
How... How is everything?

19:13.119 --> 19:14.609
It's great.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.659
You celebrating?

19:18.749 --> 19:20.865
Yeah. I just got into
business school.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.166
Boston.

19:22.253 --> 19:25.211
Hey, I couldn't get arugula,
but I found this spring mix.

19:25.297 --> 19:28.414
That's good. Uh, this is Rhoda, an
old friend of mine from high school.

19:28.509 --> 19:30.249
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

19:30.344 --> 19:32.130
- I'm Claire.
- Hi.

19:33.514 --> 19:35.880
So, are you working?

19:35.975 --> 19:37.840
West Haven High.

19:37.935 --> 19:39.721
Yeah? What do you teach?

19:39.854 --> 19:42.596
- I clean.
- What?

19:42.690 --> 19:44.555
I clean the school.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.483
Oh, that's cool. That's
probably very therapeutic.

19:50.865 --> 19:53.481
All right. Well, it was
good to see you, Rhoda.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.066
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.073
Nice to meet you.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.629
How do you know her?

20:16.724 --> 20:18.180
High school.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.063
Yeah?

21:14.573 --> 21:16.859
- Mr. Burroughs?
- Mm-hmm.

21:16.951 --> 21:18.236
I, uh...

21:18.369 --> 21:19.950
- What?
- ... came to...

21:22.623 --> 21:24.454
I came to tell you about...

21:27.711 --> 21:29.042
What?

21:30.923 --> 21:33.665
Tell you about a tri... a free trial
of our cleaning service.

21:33.759 --> 21:34.839
What?

21:34.927 --> 21:36.918
I'm from Maid In Haven.

21:37.012 --> 21:38.798
We're a cleaning service.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.798
- We're looking to expand our
territory and our... - No, thank you.

21:51.694 --> 21:53.434
Wait.

21:57.074 --> 21:58.735
Did you say
"trial cleaning"?

22:01.495 --> 22:02.985
- Did you say "trial cleaning"?
- Yeah...

22:03.122 --> 22:04.362
- God.
- Sorry, it's a t...

22:04.498 --> 22:06.113
- Is it definitely free?
- Yeah.

22:06.208 --> 22:07.869
Fine. Let's go.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.291
Come on.

22:23.726 --> 22:25.887
Come on.
You can start in here.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.901
Did you say "Maid In Haven"?

22:40.910 --> 22:42.650
- Yes.
- Like New Haven?

22:43.579 --> 22:44.739
Yes.

22:46.081 --> 22:48.447
You're pretty far from New Haven.

22:49.919 --> 22:52.126
There's a lot
of competition in town,

22:52.212 --> 22:54.828
so we're offering
the free trial as a...

22:54.924 --> 22:56.630
Where are your supplies?

22:57.760 --> 23:00.752
Uh, normally, the first time
is a consultation.

23:01.764 --> 23:03.880
Okay.

23:03.974 --> 23:06.841
Well, you're already here,
so why don't you just...

23:08.479 --> 23:10.765
clean this for a start?

23:10.856 --> 23:13.472
Okay? There's mops
and things in there.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.058
Okay.

23:16.153 --> 23:17.859
I'm gonna be in that room.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.558
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

24:45.951 --> 24:48.658
<i>Scientists have said there is
overwhelming evidence...</i>

24:48.746 --> 24:50.953
<i>that the two Earths...</i>

25:31.371 --> 25:35.159
All right, that's enough.
It's time for you to go.

25:41.256 --> 25:43.668
So... Wait.
Is that it for the free trial?

25:44.510 --> 25:48.423
Yeah, it's a one-day trial.

25:48.514 --> 25:51.881
Um, all right.
So I'll see you next week.

25:53.769 --> 25:57.102
I'll let them know.
They might send someone else.

25:57.231 --> 25:59.472
- Okay.
- Same time, same...

25:59.566 --> 26:02.353
Yeah, this is a good time.
This is a good day too.

26:43.318 --> 26:46.025
So, Jeff, I think we've got
a pretty important toast in order.

26:46.155 --> 26:48.271
- What do you think, huh?
- Hey, hey, hey! Hold on, hold on!

26:48.407 --> 26:49.793
I just got the cider.

26:49.794 --> 26:51.444
Come on, guys,
it's not that big of a deal.

26:51.577 --> 26:54.660
- Oh!
- It is a big deal.

26:54.746 --> 26:58.079
You've shown perseverance
in the face of adversity.

26:58.208 --> 27:00.995
You deserve to be saluted for that, Son.

27:05.841 --> 27:08.503
Come on, Rho-tard.
Aren't you gonna ask what happened?

27:09.678 --> 27:11.214
What happened?

27:11.305 --> 27:14.763
- I got into UConn.
- And we are so proud of you!

27:14.850 --> 27:16.340
Hear, hear!

27:16.435 --> 27:17.925
Chin-chin!

27:18.020 --> 27:20.807
Cheers.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.604
Mr. Burroughs?

27:33.368 --> 27:37.111
I came to tell you that I saw you
at the site of the accident.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.867
And I'm sorry for what happened
to you and your family.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.038
It was my fault.

27:52.763 --> 27:54.094
Mr. Burroughs.

27:56.391 --> 27:57.847
- Oh. Good.
- Mr. Burroughs.

27:57.976 --> 27:59.261
- I...
- Come on in.

27:59.353 --> 28:01.014
You can start where you finished.

28:01.104 --> 28:03.095
I was wondering if I could
talk with you about something.

28:03.190 --> 28:06.148
Not now. A little bit later.

29:57.721 --> 29:59.928
I'm finished.

30:01.892 --> 30:03.723
Check's on the kitchen table.

30:35.133 --> 30:37.670
We're not real.
W- We're not real.

30:37.761 --> 30:40.252
We're a projection of the
imagination of Earth Two.

31:22.055 --> 31:23.135
Hmm.

32:01.178 --> 32:03.885
<i>This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,</i>

32:03.972 --> 32:06.338
<i>the United States,
planet Earth.</i>

32:06.433 --> 32:08.094
<i>Do you read me?</i>

32:14.357 --> 32:16.643
<i>This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,</i>

32:16.735 --> 32:19.101
<i>the United States,
planet Earth.</i>

32:19.196 --> 32:20.527
<i>Do you read me?</i>

32:20.614 --> 32:22.570
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

32:28.580 --> 32:30.195
<i>Let's try another channel.</i>

32:34.419 --> 32:35.829
<i>I repeat...</i>

32:35.921 --> 32:38.537
<i>this is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,</i>

32:38.632 --> 32:40.668
<i>the United States,
planet Earth.</i>

32:40.759 --> 32:42.340
<i>We... you.</i>

32:44.346 --> 32:46.553
<i>We read you.</i>

32:46.640 --> 32:47.800
<i>...clear...</i>

32:48.850 --> 32:50.340
<i>Copy.</i>

32:52.437 --> 32:53.768
<i>Verified?</i>

32:59.778 --> 33:02.235
<i>This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI.</i>

33:02.322 --> 33:04.187
<i>Is someone there?</i>

33:05.450 --> 33:07.611
<i>Do you read me?</i>

33:07.702 --> 33:10.193
<i>This is Dr. Joan T-Tallis.</i>

33:10.288 --> 33:12.779
<i>We're getting feedback.</i>

33:17.629 --> 33:18.960
<i>Hello?</i>

33:20.882 --> 33:22.372
<i>Hello?</i>

33:26.263 --> 33:28.128
<i>My name is Joan Tallis.</i>

33:28.265 --> 33:31.177
<i>- Whoa! No way!
- I am the director of SETI.</i>

33:31.268 --> 33:34.852
<i>- Dude!
- In Mountain View, California.</i>

33:39.401 --> 33:40.982
<i>When were you born?</i>

33:45.907 --> 33:50.321
<i>May 7, 1954.</i>

33:50.412 --> 33:52.494
<i>When were you born?</i>

33:54.874 --> 33:58.742
<i>May 7, 1954.</i>

33:58.837 --> 34:01.294
<i>Mount Pleasant, New York.</i>

34:01.381 --> 34:03.793
<i>Robinson Hope Hospital.</i>

34:07.345 --> 34:10.803
<i>I took a trip to Cape Canaveral
when I was a kid.</i>

34:12.934 --> 34:14.925
<i>Did you?</i>

34:15.020 --> 34:18.183
<i>Yes. I was 11.</i>

34:20.817 --> 34:23.775
<i>What did you buy
at the gift store?</i>

34:29.826 --> 34:32.283
<i>Space food.</i>

34:32.370 --> 34:36.079
<i>I thought I would be
going to space.</i>

34:36.166 --> 34:41.627
<i>I bought these...
astro strawberries.</i>

34:46.217 --> 34:47.797
- What?
- Oh, come on.

34:47.886 --> 34:51.378
- No way, dude! No way!
- What does that... What does that mean?

34:51.514 --> 34:52.572
It's... It's... Listen.

34:52.574 --> 34:54.221
What does that mean?
I don't understand what that means.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.889
Kimberly, it's just
an elaborate hoax.

34:56.018 --> 34:57.759
- There's gotta be an explanation.
- We're all gonna die.

34:57.854 --> 34:59.344
- Wait, wait!
- We are all gonna die.

35:44.067 --> 35:47.355
<i>It would be very hard to think
"I am over there"...</i>

35:47.445 --> 35:49.811
<i>and "Can I go meet me?"...</i>

35:49.906 --> 35:54.115
<i>and "Is that me better
than this me?"</i>

35:54.202 --> 35:57.911
<i>"Can I learn from the other me?"</i>

35:57.997 --> 36:01.330
<i>"Has the other me made
the same mistakes I've made?"</i>

36:01.418 --> 36:05.536
<i>Or, "Can I sit down and have
a conversation with me?"</i>

36:05.630 --> 36:07.746
<i>Wouldn't that be
an interesting thing?</i>

36:07.841 --> 36:11.459
<i>The truth is, we do that
all day long every day.</i>

36:11.553 --> 36:16.547
<i>People don't admit it and they don't
think about it too much, but they do.</i>

36:16.641 --> 36:18.882
<i>Every day, they're talking
in their own head.</i>

36:18.977 --> 36:20.888
<i>"What's he doing?"
"Why'd he do that?"</i>

36:20.979 --> 36:23.766
<i>"What did she think?"
"Did I say the right thing?"</i>

36:23.857 --> 36:26.940
<i>In this case,
there's another you out there.</i>

36:55.638 --> 36:57.344
Wanna take a look?

37:12.197 --> 37:13.858
My God.

37:36.846 --> 37:38.928
Yeah.

37:41.684 --> 37:43.174
Wow.

37:54.113 --> 37:56.274
You're up there and I'm up there.

37:58.117 --> 38:00.950
It's just too much.

38:01.037 --> 38:03.244
I wonder if I'm cleaning your house.

38:03.331 --> 38:04.491
Ha!

38:05.416 --> 38:07.407
Maybe.

38:12.507 --> 38:15.169
<i>- Total's 29.
- Thank you.</i>

38:21.808 --> 38:23.799
Can you hand me a paper towel?

38:26.646 --> 38:27.806
Thanks.

38:33.194 --> 38:35.355
If you wanna join me...

38:41.035 --> 38:42.775
<i>Round one.</i>

38:46.457 --> 38:48.448
You can come in.

38:57.594 --> 38:59.630
<i>Knockout.</i>

38:59.721 --> 39:01.632
You wanna play?

39:01.723 --> 39:04.009
I don't know how.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.556
It's easy.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.554
It's easy.
You're a fighter, I'm sure.

39:07.645 --> 39:09.636
The controller's up on the...

39:11.774 --> 39:13.765
Hold the big one
in your right hand.

39:16.529 --> 39:18.565
- You okay playing boxing?
- Yeah, yeah.

39:18.656 --> 39:19.611
Okay.

39:19.699 --> 39:22.236
To block shots,
you put your hands up.

39:22.327 --> 39:24.067
Face.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.904
And you... You know,
you lean and stuff.

39:26.998 --> 39:30.081
And then for swinging, you just swing.
That's it.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.533
All right?

39:31.628 --> 39:34.085
<i>- Round one.
- Fight.</i>

39:43.556 --> 39:45.046
You gotta fight back.

39:45.141 --> 39:48.224
Don't forget your uppercut.

39:48.353 --> 39:50.685
- One! Two!
- My guy's, uh, on the ground.

39:50.772 --> 39:52.637
That's it.

39:52.732 --> 39:55.565
<i>- Knockout!
- God.</i>

39:55.693 --> 39:56.694
How do I hook my...

39:56.695 --> 39:58.856
You gotta swing.
You gotta swing. It's okay.

39:58.988 --> 40:00.569
Easy.

40:03.076 --> 40:05.658
Yeah. Try and break
through this.

40:07.872 --> 40:10.830
Okay. That one...
I gave you.

40:22.679 --> 40:24.135
<i>Knockout!</i>

40:24.222 --> 40:26.929
<i>- Player one wins!
- Okay.</i>

40:27.016 --> 40:31.134
Well...

40:31.229 --> 40:33.220
That it, or you got
another one in you?

40:35.274 --> 40:36.855
I thought so.

40:54.377 --> 40:56.242
I didn't see your car.

40:57.714 --> 40:59.420
I take Metro-North.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.583
I'll give you a lift.

41:04.429 --> 41:05.919
No, that's all right.

41:06.014 --> 41:09.677
No, it's too cold to wait for the train.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.473
I don't mind the cold.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.310
Really, it's okay.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.310
Okay.

41:18.401 --> 41:20.141
<i>It's typical for planets...</i>

41:20.236 --> 41:22.477
<i>like Mercury, Venus,
Mars and Jupiter...</i>

41:22.572 --> 41:24.153
<i>to have a period
during their orbit...</i>

41:24.240 --> 41:26.231
<i>in which they are
obscured by the sun...</i>

41:26.325 --> 41:28.691
<i>and no long observable from Earth.</i>

41:28.786 --> 41:30.742
<i>It's called superior conjunction.</i>

41:30.830 --> 41:32.366
<i>If they remain behind the sun...</i>

41:36.627 --> 41:39.084
So, are you from New Haven?

41:39.881 --> 41:41.337
Yeah.

41:41.466 --> 41:44.082
- Still have family there?
- Mm-hmm.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.296
You like working
at Maid in Haven?

41:51.142 --> 41:52.848
It's all right.

41:52.935 --> 41:55.768
Yeah. Have you
been doing it long?

41:55.855 --> 41:58.016
Couple months.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.606
- You see that Joan Tallis broadcast?
- Yeah.

42:00.735 --> 42:03.602
- It's crazy.
- I can't stop thinking about it.

42:04.822 --> 42:06.813
Another me up there somewhere.

42:09.285 --> 42:12.027
If you met yourself,
what would you say?

42:15.041 --> 42:17.123
"Hey, you up
for a video game?"

42:19.837 --> 42:22.294
Probably beat me.

42:24.008 --> 42:25.748
What would you say?

42:27.970 --> 42:30.177
"Better luck next time. "

42:32.058 --> 42:34.094
- Really?
- No, no.

42:34.185 --> 42:35.641
No, I mean...

42:35.728 --> 42:38.219
I'm sure I'd be speechless.

42:44.654 --> 42:47.316
Up at the corner here is good.
Right here, and then you can just...

42:47.406 --> 42:49.067
No, I'll take you to your house.
Is this it?

42:49.158 --> 42:51.649
Yeah, okay. Right. Turn.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.032
- Yeah, just to the side behind tha van.
- Okay.

43:04.423 --> 43:06.414
- All right. So I'll see you next week.
- Yeah.

43:06.551 --> 43:09.042
- Thanks for the lift.
- Sure.

43:09.137 --> 43:11.298
Oh, um, you know...

43:11.389 --> 43:14.051
I'm sorry. My memory's not
what it used to be. I forgot your name.

43:16.644 --> 43:19.056
I don't think I ever told you.

43:19.147 --> 43:21.229
Really?

43:21.315 --> 43:24.773
That's not very polite of me.
So, it's...

43:26.612 --> 43:28.102
Rhoda.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.572
Rhoda. All right.

43:34.370 --> 43:36.702
Good night, Rhoda.
I'll see you next week.

43:38.207 --> 43:39.663
Good night.

44:14.577 --> 44:16.442
Listen to me.

44:16.537 --> 44:19.119
Keep your mind clear.

44:19.207 --> 44:21.289
And that's it.

44:21.375 --> 44:24.162
You will have peace of mind.

44:24.253 --> 44:26.995
My dear, don't worry.

44:27.089 --> 44:30.001
Learn to adjust yourself.

44:35.389 --> 44:37.846
<i>The distance is not inordinately great.</i>

44:37.934 --> 44:40.801
<i>But one of the challenges you have...</i>

44:40.895 --> 44:43.056
<i>on interplanetary travel...</i>

44:43.147 --> 44:45.684
<i>Is prolonged weightless conditions.</i>

44:45.775 --> 44:47.640
<i>You're in zero "G."</i>

44:47.735 --> 44:51.944
<i>There is a possibility of
cosmic rays coming from stars,</i>

44:52.031 --> 44:54.147
<i>and that could be
dangerous to them.</i>

44:54.242 --> 44:55.607
<i>But once there,</i>

44:55.701 --> 44:58.784
<i>you have no idea
what you're about to encounter.</i>

44:58.871 --> 45:03.080
<i>What really are the beings
on this other planet like?</i>

45:38.244 --> 45:39.780
What happened?

45:40.913 --> 45:42.869
I tried to do too much.

45:50.381 --> 45:51.791
Thanks.

45:56.387 --> 45:58.469
You know that story
of the Russian cosmonaut?

46:00.057 --> 46:01.547
Mm-mmm.

46:05.229 --> 46:06.514
Thanks.

46:08.691 --> 46:11.273
- So, the cosmonaut.
- Mm-hmm.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.898
He's the first man ever
to go into space.

46:14.989 --> 46:17.196
Right? The Russians
beat the Americans.

46:17.283 --> 46:18.489
Mm-hmm.

46:18.576 --> 46:21.158
So he goes up
in this big spaceship,

46:21.245 --> 46:24.362
but the only habitable
part of it's very small.

46:25.333 --> 46:27.449
So the cosmonaut's in there,

46:27.543 --> 46:29.659
and he's got this portal window,

46:29.754 --> 46:34.498
and he's looking out of it, and he
sees the curvature of the Earth...

46:34.592 --> 46:36.503
for the first time.

46:36.594 --> 46:40.803
I mean, the first man to ever
look at the planet he's from.

46:42.308 --> 46:45.550
And he's lost
in that moment.

46:45.644 --> 46:50.559
And all of a sudden
this strange ticking...

46:55.279 --> 46:56.860
Begins coming out
of the dashboard.

46:56.989 --> 46:59.526
Okay. Yeah.

46:59.617 --> 47:03.360
Rips out the control panel, right?
Takes out his tools.

47:03.454 --> 47:06.912
Trying to find the sound,
trying to stop the sound.

47:06.999 --> 47:10.036
But he can't find it.
He can't stop it. It keeps going.

47:14.173 --> 47:16.710
Few hours into this,

47:16.801 --> 47:18.587
begins to feel like torture.

47:18.677 --> 47:22.465
A few days go by
with this sound,

47:22.556 --> 47:28.392
and he knows that
this small sound...

47:28.479 --> 47:30.390
will break him.

47:30.481 --> 47:32.813
He'll lose his mind.

47:32.900 --> 47:36.768
What's he gonna do?
He's up in space,

47:36.862 --> 47:39.228
alone, in a space closet.

47:39.323 --> 47:42.781
He's got 25 days left to go...

47:42.868 --> 47:45.075
with this sound.

47:45.162 --> 47:47.699
So the cosmonaut decides...

47:47.790 --> 47:49.997
the only way
to save his sanity...

47:51.001 --> 47:54.585
is to fall in love with this sound.

47:56.465 --> 47:58.547
So he closes his eyes...

48:02.847 --> 48:05.839
and he goes into
his imagination,

48:09.061 --> 48:11.552
and then he opens them.

48:13.691 --> 48:15.932
He doesn't hear ticking anymore.

48:17.403 --> 48:19.018
He hears music.

48:21.991 --> 48:24.733
And he spends
the remainder of his time...

48:25.870 --> 48:30.660
sailing through space
in total bliss...

48:31.792 --> 48:33.578
and peace.

48:46.265 --> 48:49.553
Why... are you cleaning houses?

48:51.604 --> 48:53.469
I like to clean.

48:53.606 --> 48:56.939
Nobody likes to clean.

48:57.026 --> 49:01.440
Some people build houses,
some people decorate them,

49:01.530 --> 49:03.771
some people clean them.

49:07.620 --> 49:10.578
How old are you?
Did you go to college?

49:12.124 --> 49:13.830
No.

49:15.002 --> 49:16.958
I read.

49:19.298 --> 49:20.788
A wise choice.

49:22.426 --> 49:25.759
I was a college professor.
You learn more doing it by yourself.

49:38.442 --> 49:41.184
Did you hear about
that contest?

49:41.278 --> 49:42.859
Mmm?

49:42.947 --> 49:45.438
- The shuttle to Earth Two?
- Mmm.

49:46.450 --> 49:48.406
I submitted an essay.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.489
You did?

49:57.461 --> 49:59.543
It's silly.

50:03.634 --> 50:05.590
You'd go?

50:10.349 --> 50:12.385
Yes.

50:12.476 --> 50:14.432
You don't know what's out there.

50:17.356 --> 50:19.392
That's why I would go.

50:20.901 --> 50:22.983
It's a bad idea.

50:25.072 --> 50:28.656
In Plato's allegory of the cave,
the people living in the cave...

50:34.498 --> 50:36.238
All they knew,
what was in the cave,

50:36.333 --> 50:38.449
and one day
one of them gets out...

50:38.544 --> 50:40.910
and goes out and...

50:41.005 --> 50:44.122
sees the real world,
comes back and tells the others.

50:44.216 --> 50:46.582
You know what happened to him?
They beat him up.

50:49.513 --> 50:52.220
They didn't believe it.
"T hat can't be," they said.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.722
I don't think we're ready
to know what's out there.

50:57.813 --> 50:59.269
It's a bad idea.

50:59.356 --> 51:01.221
So you'd rather
stay in the cave?

51:01.317 --> 51:03.103
I mean,
if Galileo had felt that,

51:03.193 --> 51:06.401
we'd still think we're the center of the
universe, that the sun is orbiting us.

51:06.488 --> 51:08.729
I mean... They tried to burn him
at the stake for that.

51:08.824 --> 51:10.985
Yeah, maybe they should have.

51:11.076 --> 51:13.283
We still think we're
the center of the universe.

51:13.370 --> 51:14.985
We call ourselves Earth One,
and them Earth Two.

51:15.080 --> 51:17.412
You think they called
themselves Earth Two?

51:17.541 --> 51:19.827
- Probably not.
- Did you wash that?

51:19.960 --> 51:23.623
- Did you wash that sweater?
- Yeah. Yes. I didn't dry it. I...

51:23.714 --> 51:25.705
- I laid it...
- Give me that.

51:27.384 --> 51:29.375
Why did you wash that?

51:31.305 --> 51:34.672
Stop washing things.
Just stop washing things!

51:34.767 --> 51:38.259
Leave them alone! Please!
Just go!

51:46.445 --> 51:50.438
<i>This isn't a planet with little
green men and blue avatars.</i>

51:50.532 --> 51:52.443
<i>It's essentially a mirror Earth.</i>

51:52.534 --> 51:55.901
<i>If we strike them,
they could strike us.</i>

51:55.996 --> 51:59.329
<i>If we attempt to enslave them,
they could enslave us.</i>

51:59.416 --> 52:02.749
<i>It's the perfect scenario
for mutually assured destruction.</i>

52:18.686 --> 52:20.677
<i>Preparations are nearing completion...</i>

52:20.771 --> 52:23.353
<i>for interplanetary travel
to Earth Two.</i>

52:23.440 --> 52:26.728
<i>The modified Saturn 5 rocket
has undergone rigorous testing...</i>

52:26.819 --> 52:28.980
<i>to meet federal
aerospace guidelines.</i>

52:29.071 --> 52:32.404
<i>Protesters are calling this
a modern-day Tower of Babel.</i>

52:32.491 --> 52:34.698
Where's Purdeep?

52:34.785 --> 52:36.525
Checked out.

52:36.620 --> 52:38.827
When's he coming back?

52:38.914 --> 52:40.575
I don't think he is.

52:40.666 --> 52:42.622
Poured bleach in his ears.

52:43.293 --> 52:44.624
What?

52:45.546 --> 52:47.662
Yeah.

52:48.799 --> 52:50.790
Why would he do that?

52:50.884 --> 52:54.172
Look. I don't know.
I mean, why'd he pour bleach in his eyes?

52:57.808 --> 53:00.845
- He blinded himself?
- Yeah.

53:00.936 --> 53:02.847
You didn't know?

53:04.106 --> 53:06.813
He said he was tired
of seeing himself everywhere.

53:48.692 --> 53:50.148
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:50.235 --> 53:54.228
Um, would you mind coming around
to the passenger side?

53:54.364 --> 53:56.980
- Just 'cause there's traffic and...
- Oh.

54:05.375 --> 54:09.709
I tried to reach you at your work, but
they said they had never heard of you.

54:11.340 --> 54:13.376
Um, management
changes there all the time.

54:13.467 --> 54:16.004
Is that why none of my checks
have been cashed?

54:18.514 --> 54:21.631
That's weird. L...
It must've slipped through their books.

54:21.725 --> 54:23.807
I mean,
I've been getting paid, so...

54:23.894 --> 54:25.555
Okay. Well...

54:25.646 --> 54:28.308
Anyway, that's...

54:28.398 --> 54:31.140
That's not why I'm here.
I wanted to apologize for the other day.

54:31.276 --> 54:34.018
- You know, I just...
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been...

54:34.154 --> 54:36.065
...touching things in your room.
- No, it's not...

54:36.156 --> 54:38.568
It's not your fault.
I should not have gotten upset.

54:39.451 --> 54:41.191
I'm sorry.

54:44.081 --> 54:45.867
Can I take you somewhere...

54:45.958 --> 54:47.914
and show...
show you something?

54:48.877 --> 54:50.367
Right now?

54:50.963 --> 54:52.123
Yeah.

54:52.256 --> 54:55.043
- I have to help my mom out, but...
- Please,

54:55.133 --> 54:57.089
come with me?

55:23.620 --> 55:26.236
The best seat in the house
is this row, right here.

55:26.331 --> 55:28.287
Uh, it's the one in the middle.

55:45.475 --> 55:47.261
Okay.

56:10.626 --> 56:12.708
Just a little out of tune.

56:21.595 --> 56:25.383
That's better, huh?

01:00:26.131 --> 01:00:28.964
I'd finally got to
a content place in my life.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.927
Our son was five, and my wife
was pregnant with a girl.

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:40.221
And then...

01:00:43.148 --> 01:00:44.934
they were killed.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.601
Drunk driver.
A teenager.

01:00:51.489 --> 01:00:53.480
I was in a coma.

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:58.117
And I was sleeping
all the time.

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:03.414
And I was so... angry.

01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:06.664
So afraid of what I might do to that kid.
You know?

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:11.881
So I made sure my brother got
all the court documents.

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:16.795
The driver was a minor,
so I never found out the name.

01:01:18.725 --> 01:01:20.886
Are you still there?

01:02:43.643 --> 01:02:45.884
He can't hear
or see anything.

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.599
Okay.

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:50.601
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:04.539 --> 01:03:06.245
Rhoda.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:29.637
You are wondering why.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.942
No.

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.562
No.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.398
No.

01:03:41.493 --> 01:03:43.779
You know why.

01:05:06.161 --> 01:05:07.617
Oh, Rhoda.

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:10.195
Yeah, I got some information
you might want to hear.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.907
Shoot a three for it.

01:05:17.005 --> 01:05:19.212
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay. Wait. Wait.

01:05:19.299 --> 01:05:21.665
Um, I'll give you a hint.

01:05:22.969 --> 01:05:24.960
Do you wanna get high?

01:05:26.306 --> 01:05:27.967
With you?

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.638
No, no.

01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:33.184
Do you want to get high?

01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:43.319
They called.

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:45.067
Number's on your door.

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:47.565
Seriously?

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:49.901
Seriously.

01:05:58.546 --> 01:06:00.832
Wait. Hey.

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:03.040
You better write back to me
this time, okay?

01:06:41.798 --> 01:06:44.710
<i>United Space Ventures,
Keith Harding's office.</i>

01:06:46.052 --> 01:06:49.419
Hello. This is, uh,
Rhoda Williams.

01:06:49.514 --> 01:06:52.221
My brother gave me
this number.

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:54.799
<i>Rhoda, yes.
Just a moment.</i>

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.561
<i>- Rhoda?
- Yes.</i>

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:05.314
<i>Hi. It's Keith Harding.
I got your letter.</i>

01:07:06.239 --> 01:07:08.321
<i>I was very moved by it.</i>

01:07:09.117 --> 01:07:11.449
<i>You know, when I was 15,</i>

01:07:11.536 --> 01:07:14.403
<i>my headmaster said to me...
he said, uh,</i>

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:18.456
<i>"Harding, you'll either go to prison
or be a millionaire. "</i>

01:07:18.543 --> 01:07:20.829
<i>Yeah, well, I'm...</i>

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.161
<i>I'm grateful
it was the latter.</i>

01:07:23.256 --> 01:07:26.464
<i>But, uh, it's a fine line.</i>

01:07:26.551 --> 01:07:28.337
<i>And finer than you would think.</i>

01:07:29.887 --> 01:07:31.798
<i>You still want to
go to space, Rhoda?</i>

01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:33.299
Do I...

01:07:33.808 --> 01:07:35.719
Yes.

01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:37.801
<i>Well, you can.</i>

01:07:37.895 --> 01:07:39.760
<i>The seat is yours.</i>

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.896
<i>Kerry'll be in touch with you
with the details.</i>

01:07:44.235 --> 01:07:46.191
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:12.593
<i>Within our lifetimes, we have marveled...</i>

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.470
<i>as biologists have managed to look
at ever smaller and smaller things.</i>

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.471
<i>And astronomers have looked
further and further...</i>

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:24.350
<i>into the dark night sky,
back in time and out in space.</i>

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.942
<i>But maybe
the most mysterious of all...</i>

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:30.441
<i>is neither the small
nor the large.</i>

01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:32.567
<i>It's us, up close.</i>

01:08:34.327 --> 01:08:36.533
<i>Could we even
recognize ourselves?</i>

01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:39.363
<i>And if we did,
would we know ourselves?</i>

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:42.288
<i>What would we say to ourselves?</i>

01:08:42.377 --> 01:08:44.993
<i>What would we learn
from ourselves?</i>

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:47.170
<i>What would we really
like to see...</i>

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:50.167
<i>if we could
stand outside ourselves...</i>

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:52.215
<i>and look at us?</i>

01:10:50.505 --> 01:10:52.746
Hi.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.421
A nice surprise.

01:10:55.301 --> 01:10:57.417
You're all dressed up.

01:10:59.096 --> 01:11:01.963
Do you remember that essay
contest I told you about?

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:04.424
Travel to Earth Two?

01:11:04.519 --> 01:11:06.009
Uh-huh.

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:08.595
I won.

01:11:10.316 --> 01:11:12.307
I'm gonna go to space.

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:14.187
You won. That's great.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:19.402
That's fantastic.
We have to celebrate. Come here.

01:11:19.534 --> 01:11:21.115
Come on. We have to.

01:11:21.202 --> 01:11:23.488
Come here.
We have to celebrate.

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:25.490
First things first...

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:28.038
is to start with a drink.

01:11:28.125 --> 01:11:30.992
We have to celebrate.

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:32.998
I can't believe...

01:11:33.089 --> 01:11:35.626
How many people...
How many people wrote in?

01:11:35.716 --> 01:11:37.206
That is...

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.341
I'm so happy for you.

01:11:45.142 --> 01:11:48.384
To the coming true
of your most improbable dream.

01:11:48.479 --> 01:11:50.219
Congratulations.

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.772
Next step is a feast.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.446
- I'm gonna cook you a celebration feast.
- Yeah.

01:12:04.579 --> 01:12:06.240
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:09.697
Okay, uh, food.
We need food first.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.876
And...

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.709
do they know
how prepared you are?

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:24.091
I mean, with the Joan Tallis
costume, for Halloween?

01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:26.638
I will be fully
trained in the Mojave Desert.

01:12:26.726 --> 01:12:28.842
Oh. Well, that's comforting.

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:31.598
They made me sign
this waiver.

01:12:31.689 --> 01:12:35.898
Basically every other line of it
says, "If you die, it's your fault. "

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:39.318
And you seem... you
seem totally okay with that.

01:12:42.909 --> 01:12:45.150
You know, you'll need
an executor for your will.

01:12:45.244 --> 01:12:47.155
Do you have one?

01:12:47.246 --> 01:12:49.612
No, but I don't have anything.

01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:53.078
Okay, so nothing to no one.

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:56.252
Sounds pretty easy.
I think I could handle that.

01:12:56.339 --> 01:12:58.455
Um, burial or cremation?

01:13:00.176 --> 01:13:03.339
I think my body would
probably burn up on reentry.

01:13:03.429 --> 01:13:05.966
Or be lost in space, so...

01:13:06.057 --> 01:13:09.891
Okay. Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

01:13:14.941 --> 01:13:17.182
We'll have to hold
a memorial service.

01:13:18.611 --> 01:13:20.351
Who would you like to attend?

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.690
I don't know.

01:13:27.745 --> 01:13:29.281
You?

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:38.202
Don't go.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.006
Please don't go.

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.716
We're so close
to something here.

01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:57.980
We can't.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.478
Why can't we?

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.567
- You know that we can't.
- I know that we have.

01:14:07.702 --> 01:14:10.114
Stay, please?

01:14:39.483 --> 01:14:41.474
Let me tell you a story.

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:48.606
And if, after,
you still want me to stay,

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:53.160
I will stay.

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:04.921
It's about a girl.

01:15:08.262 --> 01:15:10.628
At the start, she's...

01:15:12.767 --> 01:15:14.348
naive,

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:18.135
reckless.

01:15:21.776 --> 01:15:24.017
She does something that is...

01:15:26.906 --> 01:15:28.646
unforgivable.

01:15:32.203 --> 01:15:36.993
And one day,
she goes to apologize.

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.992
But she loses her nerve.

01:15:44.256 --> 01:15:45.837
She's weak.

01:15:47.218 --> 01:15:49.379
She lies to him.

01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:57.091
And then...

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:03.348
she thinks that she might,
in the smallest ways,

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:08.395
be able to make his life
just a little bit better.

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:14.700
And so she wakes up
every day just to do that.

01:16:17.498 --> 01:16:20.365
And some days
she thinks it's for him.

01:16:20.459 --> 01:16:24.293
Other days, she worries
that it's for herself,

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.292
that it was really just a way
to survive what I have done.

01:16:29.009 --> 01:16:32.172
But I think that
I do make you happy.

01:16:32.263 --> 01:16:33.924
Oh, my God.

01:16:34.014 --> 01:16:36.881
I know that
you make me happy.

01:16:52.032 --> 01:16:54.398
It was my fault.

01:16:59.707 --> 01:17:02.119
I killed your wife and your son.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.911
You better leave.

01:17:11.135 --> 01:17:12.841
Get out.

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:18.096
Get out now!

01:17:23.314 --> 01:17:25.054
Now!

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:55.801
<i>The mystery flight member
is 21-year-old Rhoda Williams,</i>

01:17:55.888 --> 01:17:58.129
<i>who is rumored to be
an ex-convict.</i>

01:17:58.224 --> 01:18:00.010
<i>Her records are off-limit
to the public,</i>

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:03.058
<i>as the alleged crime
occurred when she was under age.</i>

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:06.558
<i>There are reports of offers up to
three million dollars on the Web...</i>

01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:09.015
<i>for a ticket
aboard USV's flight.</i>

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:11.813
<i>We're getting word now that she's
arriving at her residence in New Haven,</i>

01:18:11.946 --> 01:18:14.107
<i>...where Robert Hughes is standing by.
- Oh. Oh. Can you get...</i>

01:18:14.198 --> 01:18:16.234
<i>Right here.</i>

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.651
<i>Rhoda, are you going to space?</i>

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:24.075
<i>- Rhoda Williams.
- Rhoda.</i>

01:18:25.251 --> 01:18:27.663
Just one photo.

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:30.919
Rhoda.

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:32.712
You couldn't have told us?

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:35.173
- We had to find out from the media?
- I ju...

01:18:35.261 --> 01:18:37.001
I just found out.

01:18:37.096 --> 01:18:39.838
I wasn't sure I wanted to go.
I didn't...

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:42.173
Are you going?

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:46.013
I'm gonna go.

01:18:46.105 --> 01:18:47.686
Well, now...
now, wait a minute.

01:18:47.773 --> 01:18:50.515
I mean, don't you think we... we should
have a discussion about this?

01:18:50.609 --> 01:18:52.850
Oh, they're in the backyard now.

01:18:54.446 --> 01:18:56.687
Look, Rob...
Rhoda. Rhoda.

01:19:24.518 --> 01:19:26.804
<i>Joining me now
from Washington, D.C.,</i>

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:29.807
<i>astrophysicist
Dr. Richard Berendzen,</i>

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:33.482
<i>the original proponent of this extraordinary
Broken Mirror Theory.</i>

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:36.686
<i>Dr. Berendzen, tell me the significance
of this theory,</i>

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.691
<i>why it excites you
and how this changes...</i>

01:19:38.782 --> 01:19:42.366
<i>the possibilities of the planet
known as Earth Two.</i>

01:19:42.453 --> 01:19:44.944
<i>In the grand history of the cosmos,</i>

01:19:45.039 --> 01:19:48.372
<i>more than 13,000 million years old,</i>

01:19:48.459 --> 01:19:51.246
<i>our Earth is replicated elsewhere.</i>

01:19:51.337 --> 01:19:53.578
<i>But maybe there's another way
of seeing this world.</i>

01:19:54.882 --> 01:19:58.921
<i>If any small variation arises...</i>

01:19:59.011 --> 01:20:01.377
<i>they look this way,
you look that way...</i>

01:20:02.514 --> 01:20:05.051
<i>suddenly, maybe everything changes,</i>

01:20:05.142 --> 01:20:07.804
<i>and now you begin to wonder,</i>

01:20:08.687 --> 01:20:11.099
<i>what else is different?</i>

01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:13.681
<i>Or one might say that...</i>

01:20:13.776 --> 01:20:17.018
<i>you have an exact mirror image
which suddenly is shattered,</i>

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:19.103
<i>and there's a new reality.</i>

01:20:20.199 --> 01:20:23.111
<i>And therein lies the opportunity...</i>

01:20:23.786 --> 01:20:25.617
<i>and the mystery.</i>

01:20:26.205 --> 01:20:27.911
<i>What else?</i>

01:20:27.998 --> 01:20:30.410
<i>What new? What now?</i>

01:21:17.214 --> 01:21:19.330
Stay away!

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:26.799
Get away from me.

01:21:26.932 --> 01:21:30.595
- Please let me in. Please. Just...
- Stay... Stay away from me!

01:21:30.686 --> 01:21:32.722
Stay away!

01:22:07.347 --> 01:22:08.837
John?

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:46.003
- John?
- Stay away from me.

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:48.005
John, please let me in.

01:22:48.138 --> 01:22:50.129
- Stay away from me!
- Open the door.

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:52.176
- I'm warning you, stay away from me!
- Please.

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:55.054
I have something I have to explain.
I have to tell you. Please.

01:22:55.145 --> 01:22:56.851
Wait.

01:22:56.939 --> 01:22:58.770
Okay...

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:05.602
John.

01:23:08.033 --> 01:23:09.193
Do it.

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:04.874
I heard on TV about a theory.

01:24:09.928 --> 01:24:11.509
They think...

01:24:12.723 --> 01:24:16.682
that the moment
we first saw the other Earth...

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:21.846
was the moment
our synchronicity was broken.

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:28.814
That was just
over four years ago.

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:35.571
Maybe they're up there.

01:24:36.788 --> 01:24:38.744
Maybe not, but...

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:42.995
maybe.

01:25:47.943 --> 01:25:49.979
<i>We are just days before the launch...</i>

01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:52.106
<i>of the United Space Ventures'
civilian shuttle.</i>

01:25:52.197 --> 01:25:54.313
<i>Members of the crew
of this dangerous voyage...</i>

01:25:54.408 --> 01:25:57.741
<i>have been training intensely
here at the Mojave Spaceport.</i>

01:25:57.828 --> 01:25:59.568
<i>The media blackout
was finally lifted...</i>

01:25:59.663 --> 01:26:01.574
<i>with a press conference
early this morning.</i>

01:26:01.665 --> 01:26:04.122
<i>I'm feeling privileged,</i>

01:26:04.209 --> 01:26:06.370
<i>and,</i>

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:08.417
<i>oddly, I'm proud.</i>

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:13.377
<i>And, of course,
nervous and excited.</i>

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:16.335

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:18.632
