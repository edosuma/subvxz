REALLY NEEDS THIS MONEY

10:54.300 --> 10:55.506

10:55.620 --> 10:56.712
AND OBVIOUSLY JASMINE
REALLY WANTS TO GIVE IT TO HER.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.754
SO DO NOT ROCK THE BOAT.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.851
THIS IS FAMILY, YOU KNOW?

11:00.970 --> 11:04.235
IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

11:06.010 --> 11:08.410
- GROUND BEEF.
THERE YOU GO.

11:08.520 --> 11:09.839
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

11:09.940 --> 11:12.454
NEXT!
- HEY, CARLOS.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.972
UM, HMM.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.069
LET'S SEE...

11:16.190 --> 11:18.806
- KRISTINA,
WHAT CAN I GET YOU TODAY?

11:18.910 --> 11:21.219
- UM, LET ME TRY
FIVE ITALIAN TURKEY SAUSAGE,

11:21.330 --> 11:27.189
AND ALSO LET'S DO
2 POUNDS OF LEAN GROUND BEEF.

11:27.300 --> 11:31.236
- UM, 2 POUNDS
OF LEAN GROUND BEEF.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.649
5 POUNDS ITALIAN SAUSAGE.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.307
- SURE.

11:35.410 --> 11:37.549
- ALL RIGHT.

11:37.660 --> 11:40.379
- HERE YOU GO.

11:47.670 --> 11:50.423
[knocking on door]

11:50.530 --> 11:52.634
- HEY.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.015
- HEY.
- MIND IF I COME IN?

11:55.120 --> 11:57.088
- YEAH.

11:59.780 --> 12:01.645
- [deep si
h

12:01.750 --> 12:03.229
- I'M ALL RIGHT.
- YOU SURE?

12:03.340 --> 12:04.819
- I JUST HAD SORT OF
A CRUMMY DAY.

12:04.930 --> 12:06.477
EVERYWHERE THAT I WENT TODAY,

12:06.580 --> 12:08.229
EVERYBODY LOOKED AT ME LIKE
I WAS SOME SORT OF A FREAK SHOW.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.683
YOU KNOW CARLOS, OUR BUTCHER?
- YEP.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.109
- HE LOOKED AT ME
LIKE I HAD LEPROSY,

12:12.210 --> 12:13.586
LIKE HE WAS GONNA CATCH IT.

12:13.690 --> 12:15.317
I JUST HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.
- IT'S JUST STARTLING.

12:15.420 --> 12:16.409
PEOPLE JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT
OF TIME TO GET USED TO IT.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.693
- STARTLING FOR WHO?
FOR--OKAY, DON'T DO THAT.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.835
DON'T DO THAT.
- DON'T DO WHAT?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.146
- I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT

12:21.250 --> 12:21.659
OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS
RIGHT NOW, I DON'T.

12:21.770 --> 12:24.523
- ALL RIGHT.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.289
WHAT ABOUT--WHAT ABOUT MAX?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.492
- MAX LOVES IT.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.079
HE SAYS I LOOK LIKE BANE
FROM THE BATMANMOVIE.

12:29.190 --> 12:30.464
- LISTEN, HONEY.
- ADAM, I JUST--

12:30.570 --> 12:31.707
- THIS IS A PART
OF THE PROCESS.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.082
THIS IS A TOUGH PART
OF THE PROCESS.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.326
WE KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE
LIKE THIS.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.532
- IS IT?
- YEAH.

12:35.650 --> 12:36.958
- IT'S PART OF THE PROCESS?

12:37.060 --> 12:38.334
- YOUR HAIR IS STILL IN THERE.
IT'S GONNA GROW BACK.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.816
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, OKAY?
- THEN HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

12:39.930 --> 12:40.817
- I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE THING
WOULD BE SO, YOU KNOW,

12:40.930 --> 12:43.137
TRANSFORMING AND LIBERATING,

12:43.240 --> 12:44.650
AND I WOULD FEEL
THIS SENSE OF FREEDOM.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.035
AND GOING OUT THE OTHER NIGHT
LIKE I WAS A NORMAL HUMAN BEING

12:47.140 --> 12:49.176
AND HANGING OUT
WITH YOUR SISTERS

12:49.280 --> 12:54.308
AND JUST--
JUST LIKE WE USED TO, YOU KNOW?

12:54.420 --> 12:55.455
- OKAY.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.733
IT'S OKAY TO LET LOOSE
A LITTLE BIT, ALL RIGHT?

12:57.840 --> 12:58.943
- OKAY, I GET IT.
THANKS.

12:59.050 --> 13:00.187
- LISTEN, TRY NOT TO BE HARD
ON YOURSELF.

13:00.290 --> 13:02.110
- I'M NOT, OKAY?
YOU DON'T NEED TO LECTURE ME.

13:02.220 --> 13:03.494
- I'M NOT TRYING TO LECTURE YOU.
I JUST DON'T WANT--

13:03.610 --> 13:06.295
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO--
KRISTINA, I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.015
- I KNOW YOU'RE ON MY SIDE,
OKAY?

13:08.130 --> 13:09.506
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

13:09.610 --> 13:11.669
- HONEY, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.
I'M JUST GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.020
- ALL RIGHT.

13:30.390 --> 13:34.258
- SO WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR MATH TEST

13:34.360 --> 13:37.705
AND HOW PROUD
WE ARE OF YOU AND EXCITED,

13:37.810 --> 13:39.220
AND OF COURSE WE UNDERSTAND

13:39.330 --> 13:41.082
THAT YOU WAN NA
TELL YOUR MOM ABOUT IT.

13:41.190 --> 13:45.263
BUT WE HAVE TO, UM,
CLEAR SOMETHING UP.

13:45.370 --> 13:48.168
- UM, THIS IS--THIS MIGHT BE
TOUGH TO UNDERSTAND,

13:48.270 --> 13:49.373
SO JUST--
WE'LL KEEP TALKING

13:49.480 --> 13:50.993
UNTIL WE GET IT
ALL WORKED OUT, OKAY?

13:51.100 --> 13:53.307
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:56.070 --> 13:57.480
- OKAY, SO HERE'S THE THING.

13:57.590 --> 14:00.070
UM...

14:00.180 --> 14:03.627
VICTOR, YOU CAN'T...
TALK TO YOUR MOM.

14:03.730 --> 14:07.450
- WHY NOT?

14:07.570 --> 14:08.764
- WELL, BECAUSE...

14:08.880 --> 14:11.155
YOU KNOW, IN THE PAST,

14:11.260 --> 14:13.012
YOU'VE STAYED WITH FAMILIES
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

14:13.120 --> 14:13.916
AND THEN YOU'VE GONE BACK
TO YOUR MOM.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.009
- FOSTER CARE.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.085
- RIGHT.
- RIGHT.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.599
- THIS IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT,

14:17.710 --> 14:23.057
WHERE NOW
WE'VE ADOPTED YOU, AND...

14:23.170 --> 14:25.400
YOU KNOW, WE'RE YOUR PARENTS,
AND I'M YOUR MOM.

14:25.510 --> 14:27.717
- BUT YOU'RE NOT MY MOM.

14:27.830 --> 14:31.175
- OKAY, BUDDY,
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.861
UM...

14:32.970 --> 14:34.892
BUT THIS IS THE WAY IT IS.

14:35.010 --> 14:38.355
- WE'RE NOT THE ONES
MAKING THIS DECISION, OKAY?

14:38.460 --> 14:39.734
THIS IS, UM...

14:39.840 --> 14:44.561
THE COURT DECIDED THIS
BECAUSE OF HER SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.046
- I KNOW I CAN'T LIVE
WITH HER,

14:46.160 --> 14:48.014
BUT WHY CAN'T I JUST
BE FRIENDS WITH HER?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.678
- I KNOW THIS DOESN'T
SEEM FAIR.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.634
- IT'S NOT FAIR!

14:51.750 --> 14:53.297
AND YOU KNOW IT.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.404
- HIGH SOCIETY?
- NO.

14:58.510 --> 14:59.124
- ALLURE.
- NO.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.265
- CHICAGO!
- NO.

15:01.380 --> 15:04.679
- TEMPTATION.
- WHERE'S THAT ONE?

15:04.800 --> 15:05.869
- UP IN THE CORNER.
- NO.

15:05.970 --> 15:06.994
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT IT.

15:07.110 --> 15:08.270
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
- WHAT?

15:08.390 --> 15:10.529
- I'M FEELING IT.
IT'S COLONIAL MAN.

15:10.630 --> 15:11.699
HUH?
- SARAH.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.620
- COME ON, COLONIAL MAN!

15:13.740 --> 15:16.971
YES! YEAH!

15:17.080 --> 15:18.968
IT'S AWESOME.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:19.090 --> 15:21.012
PUT THAT BACK.
- OH, MY GOD.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.803
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
BRING HER HERE.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.490
IT'S TOO HARD TO DO
WITHOUT HER.

15:24.610 --> 15:27.363
- SHE'S EMBARRASSED
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

15:27.470 --> 15:29.711
I JUST WANNA DO SOMETHING NICE
FOR HER, YOU KNOW,

15:29.820 --> 15:31.048
AND I FEEL LIKE MAYBE

15:31.170 --> 15:32.614
WE SHOULDN'T BE TRYING
TO BE CREATIVE.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.062
WE SHOULD JUST FIND SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE HER

15:34.170 --> 15:35.751
AND HELP HER FEEL
NORMAL AGAIN.

15:35.860 --> 15:37.066
SO--
- YEAH.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.819
- MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LOOK
FOR SOMETHING

15:38.930 --> 15:39.897
THAT LOOKS LIKE HER HAIR.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.410
- YEAH.
WELL, I THINK WE'RE--

15:41.520 --> 15:42.623
- TROLL, REALLY?

15:42.730 --> 15:44.834
- I THINK WE'RE
IN THE WRONG AISLE IN THAT CASE.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.316
- THANK YOU FOR TAKING THAT OFF.
- LET'S GO OVER IN THE NEXT ONE.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.172
I'M BUYING IT.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

15:48.290 --> 15:49.803
- DON'T EMBARRASS ME.

15:49.910 --> 15:51.286
- OKAY, HERE,
WE'VE GOT SOME BLONDES.

15:51.390 --> 15:52.357
HOW ABOUT BARBIE?
THAT'S CUTE.

15:52.460 --> 15:55.429
LITTLE BIT SASSY.
- WELL, SHE'S NOT...

15:55.540 --> 15:56.188
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE HER
LOOK LIKE A HOOKER.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.086
- IT'S LIKE JANE FONDA.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.179
- HEY, RIGHT HERE!
LOOK AT THIS!

15:59.300 --> 16:00.744
THIS IS PERFECT.
LOOK AT THAT!

16:00.850 --> 16:01.987
_ UH--
- THAT'S IT.

16:02.090 --> 16:02.954
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE HER HAIR,
DOESN'T IT?

16:03.060 --> 16:04.709
- DOES IT?
- YEAH. DOESN'T IT?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.059
- CAN I BE EXCUSED?

16:15.180 --> 16:17.819
- FINISH YOUR BROCCOLI FIRST.

16:17.940 --> 16:19.999
- I DON'T LIKE IT.
IT'S GROSS.

16:21.530 --> 16:25.455
- OKAY, UM,
JUST CLEAR YOUR PLATE THEN.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.563
- HE DIDN'T PUT IT
IN THE DISHWASHER.

16:32.680 --> 16:33.704
- I KNOW, SYD.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.391
- AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO PUT
HIS PLACEMAT AWAY.

16:36.510 --> 16:37.363
- YEAH, IT'S FINE.

16:37.470 --> 16:39.222
HE HAS A LOT
OF HOMEWORK TONIGHT.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.853
- WELL, WHY DID HE
TURN ON THE TV?

16:40.960 --> 16:43.508
- SYD, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.338
- DO I HAVE TO FINISH
MY BROCCOLI?

16:45.450 --> 16:48.169
- SYDNEY, YOU LIKE BROCCOLI.
- I DON'T FEELLIKE BROCCOLI.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.680
- WILL YOU SHUT UP
AND EAT IT, PLEASE?

16:54.250 --> 16:58.311
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY
"SHUT UP."

16:58.430 --> 16:59.454
- HEY.

17:05.470 --> 17:06.494
[door closes]

17:06.610 --> 17:08.293
- HELLO!
- HEY.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.641
- HEY.
I'M SO SORRY I MISSED DINNER.

17:10.750 --> 17:11.842
- IT'S OKAY.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.029
- THAT SESSION
JUST WENT CRAZY LONG.

17:13.130 --> 17:14.984
WHERE'S THE BOY?

17:15.100 --> 17:16.783
- DOING HOMEWORK.
- OH, OKAY.

17:16.890 --> 17:19.609
UM...

17:19.720 --> 17:25.340
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOUR MOM, AND, UM...

17:25.450 --> 17:29.762
I BASICALLY DECIDED THAT
I THINK WE SHOULD HELP HER.

17:29.870 --> 17:35.001
I MEAN, WHEN I MARRIED YOU,
I MARRIED YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.735
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE HER
THE MONEY.

17:36.840 --> 17:37.772
- [sighs]

17:37.880 --> 17:38.869
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SAYING THAT.

17:38.980 --> 17:41.255
- YEAH.

17:41.370 --> 17:43.190
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.016
- BUT IT'S A LOT WORSE
THAN I THOUGHT.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.598
I SAT DOWN WITH HER TODAY,

17:46.720 --> 17:49.188
WENT OVER HER FINANCES,
AND IT'S A MESS.

17:49.300 --> 17:53.407
BETWEEN RENT, UTILITIES,
AND CREDIT CARD BILLS,

17:53.520 --> 17:58.230
5,000 WON'T EVEN MAKE A DENT.

17:58.350 --> 18:01.934
- OKAY, SO WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.837
- OPTION ONE IS
TO GIVE HER THE MONEY.

18:03.940 --> 18:05.419
BUT THAT WON'T LAST,

18:05.530 --> 18:07.862
AND WE'LL BE BACK IN THE SAME
SITUATION A MONTH FROM NOW.

18:07.980 --> 18:12.189
- OKAY, AND THEN OPTION TWO
IS WHAT?

18:12.290 --> 18:16.056
- SHE CAN COME STAY WITH US.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.878
- IN THIS HOUSE?
- YES, IN THIS HOUSE.

18:17.990 --> 18:21.335
- YOU--THAT'S OPTION TWO
IS YOUR MOM LIVES IN THIS HOUSE?

18:21.440 --> 18:22.225
- YEAH, WELL,
WE HAVE A SPARE BEDROOM.

18:22.340 --> 18:25.059
- THAT'S NOT A SPARE BEDROOM.

18:25.170 --> 18:28.685
THAT'S MY SPACE
WHERE I DO THINGS, OKAY?

18:28.790 --> 18:30.269
THEY'RE CREATIVE.
IT'S NOT A SPARE BEDROOM.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.029
- HONEY, I THINK YOU CAN LIVE
WITHOUT YOUR MAN-CAVE

18:32.140 --> 18:34.756
FOR A MONTH OR TWO.

18:34.870 --> 18:36.656
- FOR A MONTH OR TWO?

18:36.770 --> 18:38.146
HOW LONG YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA LIVE HERE?

18:38.250 --> 18:39.626
- I'M JUST SAYING.

18:39.730 --> 18:41.618
IT'LL ONLY BE TEMPORARY
UNTIL SHE GETS BACK ON HER FEET.

18:41.740 --> 18:42.764
- OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.074
I LOVE YOUR MOM.
I DO.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.215
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

18:46.330 --> 18:47.558
BUT WE CANNOT HAVE HER
LIVING HER.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.114
SHE'S GONNA TAKE CONTROL
OF EVERYTHING.

18:49.230 --> 18:52.609
WE'RE GONNA HAVE PRAYER CIRCLES
AND CRUCIFIXES AND ALL TH E--

18:52.710 --> 18:54.359
- SHE'LL BE OUT LOOKING
FOR A JOB.

18:54.470 --> 18:56.028
- WHY DOESN'T SHE MOVE IN
WITH SEKOU?

18:56.130 --> 18:58.052
- BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE ROOM.
- HOW COULD HE NOT HAVE ROOM?

18:58.170 --> 18:59.614
HE'S ONE PERSON,
WE'RE THREE!

18:59.720 --> 19:01.574
- LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA BE
THAT BAD.

19:01.690 --> 19:04.090
I THINK IT'D BE GREAT.
SHE CAN HELP WITH JABBAR.

19:04.210 --> 19:07.202
- GRANDMA'S MOVING IN
WITH US?

19:08.690 --> 19:10.555
AWESOME!

19:12.730 --> 19:15.904
- [humming]

19:16.010 --> 19:17.420
KRISTI NA?

19:17.530 --> 19:18.383
GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING
TODAY.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.014
- HEY.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D...

19:21.120 --> 19:21.973
- JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO HOLD YOU OVER.

19:22.090 --> 19:24.604
- BE HOME EARLY.
- HERE YOU GO.

19:24.710 --> 19:25.324
- NO BIG DEAL.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.749
- THANKS.
- YEAH, YOU BET.

19:31.510 --> 19:35.230
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- [scoffs]

19:35.340 --> 19:37.160
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT?
- IT'S--

19:37.270 --> 19:38.658
IT'S A WIG.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.749
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

19:39.860 --> 19:42.033
- I SAW YOU LOOKING FOR THEM
ON THE INTERNET,

19:42.140 --> 19:43.129
SO I THOUGHT
I'D SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE

19:43.250 --> 19:44.626
AND PICK ONE UP FOR YOU.
- WAIT A SECOND.

19:44.730 --> 19:47.039
IS THIS WHAT YOU THINK
MY HAIR LOOKS LIKE?

19:47.150 --> 19:48.071
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS A JOKE.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.319
- NO, I--
- HONEY.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.762
HONEY,
THIS IS LIKE PATHETIC.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.519
IT'S LIKE A HOOKER WIG.
I MEAN, REALLY.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.665
IT'S BAD.
IT'S REALLY BAD.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.157
I DON'T KNOW HOW--
HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND ON THAT?

20:00.260 --> 20:01.329
- $250.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.429
- UGH. YOU BETTER
GET YOUR MONEY BACK.

20:02.540 --> 20:03.950
THAT'S FOR SURE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:04.060 --> 20:05.152
I MADE A MISTAKE.

20:05.270 --> 20:05.986
- IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE TO ME.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.715
WHY WOULD YOU BUY ME A WIG?

20:07.820 --> 20:09.617
IF YOU THINK THAT I LOOK
THIS DISGUSTING,

20:09.720 --> 20:11.301
OBVIOUSLY YOU WANNA
COVER ME UP.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.616
SO THIS IS MORE FOR YOU
THAN IT IS FOR ME.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.857
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS.
- NO, IT ACTUALLY IS.

20:13.970 --> 20:15.107
- I THINK YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

20:15.210 --> 20:16.518
I THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANTED.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.030
- PLEASE ADMIT TO ME THAT
YOU HATE THAT I LOOK SICK.

20:18.140 --> 20:19.448
- I DON'T HATE
THE WAY YOU LOOK.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.720
- HONEY, WHEN I WOKE YOU UP
THE OTHER NIGHT IN BED,

20:20.840 --> 20:22.239
YOU FREAKED OUT.
- I THINK YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

20:22.350 --> 20:23.624
- YOU FREAKED OUT!
- I WAS ASLEEP.

20:23.730 --> 20:25.618
- YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
- KRISTINA, I AM NOT LYING.

20:25.740 --> 20:26.593
- STOP SAYING THAT.
- I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.452
- STOP IT!
- OKAY! ALL RIGHT!

20:28.570 --> 20:29.798
- I HAVE A PORT-A-CATH
IN MY CHEST.

20:29.910 --> 20:31.707
I HAVE BRUISES
ALL OVER MY BODY AND SCARS.

20:31.810 --> 20:32.845
MY HEAD IS BALD.

20:32.950 --> 20:34.258
- I KNOW YOU DO
AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL TO ME.

20:34.370 --> 20:35.507
- STOP IT!
- HEY!

20:35.610 --> 20:36.770
- STOP IT!
- HONEY, I'M NOT THE ENEMY HERE.

20:36.890 --> 20:37.367
- JUST TAKE IT BACK!
- I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.643
- JUST LIKE--

20:39.750 --> 20:44.028
YOU GOT IT FOR ME
OR FOR YOU?

20:44.130 --> 20:45.449
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL TAKE IT BACK.

20:45.550 --> 20:47.757
- TAKE IT BACK.
I DON'T WANT IT.

20:47.860 --> 20:48.542
- I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

20:51.590 --> 20:52.727
- AND YOU SHOULD TELL ME
WHEN YOU'RE COMING HOME EARLY.

20:54.210 --> 20:57.452
[sniffling]

21:02.260 --> 21:05.559
- I'M SORRY, HONEY.

21:05.670 --> 21:08.468
- [crying]

21:21.590 --> 21:23.785
- ALL RIGHT, AMBER.
AMBER.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.798
- YEAH? YO.
- AMBER.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.652
- YES, I'M HERE.
- MAKE SURE THESE GO OUT

21:26.760 --> 21:28.034
WITH THOSE PACKAGES, OKAY?
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

21:28.140 --> 21:29.767
- I GOTTA GO TO THE BANK,
THEN I GOTTA GET BACK FOR THE--

21:29.870 --> 21:31.553
MY 2:00 IS CANCELLED.
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

21:31.660 --> 21:32.797
- I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, THINGS GET CANCELED.

21:32.910 --> 21:33.831
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET

21:33.940 --> 21:34.804
WITH THE MANAGER
OF THE PRAIRIE BLASTERS.

21:34.910 --> 21:36.423
- WELL, LISTEN, I MEAN...

21:36.530 --> 21:37.758
ARE YOU UPSET THAT YOU HAVE
A FREE DAY NOW?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.359
- NO, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW ALL OF A SUDDEN

21:39.470 --> 21:41.426
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

21:41.540 --> 21:44.259
- WELL--
- HEY.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.325
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU DON'T EVEN--

21:45.440 --> 21:46.464
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:46.580 --> 21:47.717
YOU DON'T EVEN WANNA TALK
TO ME RIGHT NOW.

21:47.820 --> 21:49.048
- WHAT? YOU CAN'T--
WHAT ARE DOING?

21:49.160 --> 21:50.092
WHAT, ARE YOU HAVING
A GARAGE SALE?

21:50.200 --> 21:51.428
- COOL!
- DAMN IT!

21:51.550 --> 21:52.619
I'M NOT HAVING A GARAGE SALE.
- HOW MUCH IS--

21:52.720 --> 21:54.062
- I HAD TO MOVE EVERYTHING
OUT OF MY ART ROOM

21:54.170 --> 21:56.513
BECAUSE RENEE'S MOVING IN,
AND THAT IS YOUR FAULT.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.235
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
HOW IS THIS MY FAULT?

21:58.350 --> 21:59.339
- I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY.

21:59.450 --> 22:00.758
YOU ADVISED ME
TO TAKE A WEAK POSITION,

22:00.870 --> 22:02.201
SO I WENT IN THERE AND I SAID,
"YOUR FAMILY'S MY FAMILY.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.584
HERE'S $5,000."

22:04.700 --> 22:05.792
AND SHE SENSED THE WEAKNESS
AND THEN SHE ATTACKED.

22:05.910 --> 22:08.049
AND NOW I HAVE REN--
WHAT ARE YOU--

22:08.150 --> 22:08.969
I LOST THE ROOM
I DO MY STUFF IN.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.695
- I'M SORRY.
- [laughing]

22:10.810 --> 22:11.902
- YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY TOO?

22:12.020 --> 22:13.351
- YOU CAN DO IT IN MY APARTMENT.
- DO WHAT?

22:13.470 --> 22:15.495
- WHO'S THE CREATIVE ENGINE
OF THIS PLACE, YOU?

22:15.610 --> 22:17.987
ARE YOU THE CREATIVE ENGINE?

22:18.090 --> 22:19.250
ARE YOU?
- CLEARLY NOT.

22:19.370 --> 22:21.361
- YOU MIGHT ONE DAY BE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT YET.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.744
HELP ME.
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS HERE.

22:22.850 --> 22:26.399
I CAN'T HELP YOU.
MY WHOLE AFTERNOON IS BOOKED.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.711
- HEY.
- HI, HONEY.

22:29.830 --> 22:32.924
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
- ORANGE JUICE.

22:36.900 --> 22:38.765
- WHAT'S THIS?

22:38.870 --> 22:40.212
- OH, UM, NOTHING.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.356
I WAS MESSAGING MR. CYR
ABOUT THE COLLEGE ESSAY THING.

22:42.460 --> 22:43.529
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.495
IT'S JUST SHOCKING TO SEE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.737
THAT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE.
- MOM, DON'T LOOK AT IT.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.705
- WELL, I CAN'T NOT
LOOK AT IT NOW,

22:48.810 --> 22:49.970
'CAUSE IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE.
- I KNOW, BUT IT'S LITERALLY--

22:50.090 --> 22:51.296
IT'S LIKE THE TEACHERS
HAD A NEW YEAR'S EVE THING.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.321
- WHO IS THAT?
WHO IS THAT?

22:52.440 --> 22:53.668
- THE ART TEACHER.
MRS. OCKER.

22:53.780 --> 22:54.815
- SHE'S KISSING HIM
ON THE CHEEK.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.262
- BECAUSE EVERYBODY KISSES
ON THE CHEEK

22:56.370 --> 22:57.985
ON NEW YEAR'S EVE.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.670
IT'S A LIKE A LIFE RULE

22:59.790 --> 23:01.018
THAT YOU DON'T LOOK AT FACEBOOK
AT THESE TIMES.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.165
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

23:02.270 --> 23:03.510
- I SAW AMY, YOU KNOW,

23:03.620 --> 23:05.201
HOLDING HER NIECE
WITH LIKE SOME GUY ONE TIME.

23:05.310 --> 23:06.686
IT'S THE WORST.

23:06.790 --> 23:08.678
- IS HE DATING HER?
JUST TELL ME.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.244
- [laughing]
NO, HE'S NOT DATING HER.

23:10.350 --> 23:11.897
- OKAY, THAT'S ALL.
- IT'S NEW YEAR'S.

23:12.010 --> 23:14.456
- OKAY.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.697

23:17.940 --> 23:19.999
- UNCLE ADAM, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS!

23:20.120 --> 23:21.257
- ONE SECOND.
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS!

23:21.360 --> 23:22.873
- WHAT? WHAT?
- MARLEISE IS DOWNSTAIRS.

23:22.980 --> 23:24.709
SHE CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

23:24.810 --> 23:25.947
- THERE'S A FIRE TRUCK
DOWN THERE.

23:26.050 --> 23:27.221
THERE'S AN AMBULANCE.

23:27.330 --> 23:28.706
SHE SAID SHE'S CALLING THE COPS.
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

23:28.820 --> 23:29.775
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

23:33.130 --> 23:33.858
- HI.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.399
- KRISTINA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:37.510 --> 23:39.649
- I AM SO INCREDIBLY SORRY,
ADAM.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.443
I HAVE BEEN TREATING YOU
SO HORRIBLY,

23:41.550 --> 23:43.518
AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE
JUST TRYING WITH THE WIG.

23:43.620 --> 23:45.372
AND EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS AN AWFUL WIG,

23:45.490 --> 23:46.798
I JUST LOVE THE FACT
THAT YOU TRIED.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.073
SO I'D LIKE
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

23:49.180 --> 23:51.694
OKAY?

23:51.800 --> 23:52.494
UM, TONIGHT, I HAVE
A GREAT NIGHT PLANNED.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.387
I RENTED THIS AWESOME LIMO,

23:55.500 --> 23:57.491
AND I GOT US A ROOM
AT THE STERLING HOTEL

23:57.600 --> 24:00.398
WHICH IS REALLY, REALLY FANCY.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.628
AND I'D LIKE TO SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH YOU AS HUSBAND AND WIFE,

24:03.750 --> 24:06.435
NOT HUSBAND AND PATIENT.

24:06.540 --> 24:09.850
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME,

24:09.960 --> 24:12.758
I WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT ON
A DATE WITH YOU.

24:12.860 --> 24:17.069

25:21.100 --> 25:24.854
- WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO
SHOW YOUR TEST TO YOUR REAL MOM.

25:24.970 --> 25:25.959
WHO IS SHE?

25:26.070 --> 25:28.755
- WHAT'S IT TO YOU?
JUST BE QUIET.

25:28.870 --> 25:32.146
- DID SHE DO S|\Cl)C|)V|ETHING BAD?

25:32.250 --> 25:33.763
- WELL, AT THE SCHOOLYARD,
THEY SAY SHE'S IN JAIL.

25:33.870 --> 25:36.043
- SHE'S NOT IN JAIL,
STUPID!

25:36.150 --> 25:38.004
- WELL, IF SHE'S NOT IN JAIL,
WHY DOESN'T SHE COME SEE YOU?

25:38.120 --> 25:39.599
- JUST...SHUT UP!

25:39.710 --> 25:41.564
- YOUR MOM MUST NOT LOVE YOU.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.602
YOUR MOM DOESN'T LOVE YOU
'CAUSE YOU'RE A BAD KID.

25:42.710 --> 25:44.041
- WOULD YOU
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

25:44.160 --> 25:46.048
- [screaming]

25:46.160 --> 25:49.505
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

25:51.790 --> 25:53.746
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

25:53.860 --> 25:55.509
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
- GET IN THE HOUSE!

25:55.620 --> 25:57.406
- I SL--IT SLIPPED
OUT OF MY HANDS.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.407
GET INTO YOUR ROOM, PLEASE,
RIGHT NOW.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.920
- [crying]

26:02.250 --> 26:03.729
- GOD.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.001
- AW, SHE'LL REALLY
APPRECIATE THAT.

26:05.110 --> 26:07.624
THE NOISE AND THE BREEZE
HELP HER TO SLEEP.

26:07.730 --> 26:10.005
- THAT'S GREAT, HONEY.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.382
I REALLY WANT HER TO THINK
SHE'S ON A CRUISE SHIP

26:11.500 --> 26:13.764
WHILE SHE'S HERE
SO SHE DOESN'T LEAVE.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.768
- CROSBY, I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE SITUATION,

26:15.880 --> 26:17.427
BUT YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE IT OUT ON ME.

26:17.540 --> 26:19.110
- WHO SHOULD I TAKE IT OUT ON?
JABBAR?

26:19.230 --> 26:20.299
YOU MADE THE DECISION.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.913
- WHAT--
- YOU RAILROADED ME.

26:22.020 --> 26:23.533
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- YOU DIDN'T?

26:23.650 --> 26:24.810
- NO!

26:24.920 --> 26:26.547
- I DON'T REMEMBER
INVITING HER TO MOVE IN.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.857
I THINK THAT WAS YOU. YOU WENT
STRAIGHT TO THE NUCLEAR OPTION.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.064
WE COULD'VE GOTTEN HER
A CHEAP PLACE TO LIVE.

26:31.170 --> 26:32.205
- SHE'S MY MOTHER.

26:32.310 --> 26:33.299
SHE'S NOT SOME PROBLEM
YOU THROW MONEY AT.

26:33.410 --> 26:35.867
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

26:35.970 --> 26:36.994
I WANNA BE ABLE
TO COME HOME FROM WORK

26:37.110 --> 26:38.486
AND WALK AROUND
IN MY UNDERWEAR

26:38.590 --> 26:40.967
WITHOUT BUMPING INTO HER IN
THE HALLWAY AND FEELING AWKWARD.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.731
THIS IS MY SPACE, OKAY?
SHE'S INVADING IT.

26:43.840 --> 26:48.254
- FIRST OF ALL,
THIS IS OURPLACE, OKAY?

26:48.360 --> 26:51.397
SECOND OF ALL, QUIT ACTING
LIKE SHE'S SOME KIND OF MONSTER.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.559
SHE'S MY MOTHER!

26:53.680 --> 26:54.817
SHE LOVES YOU,
SHE LOVES JABBAR,

26:54.920 --> 26:56.296
AND SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.640
SO GET OVER YOURSELF.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.264
- [scoffs]
GREAT.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.746
- IS THAT MY FAULT TOO?

27:08.790 --> 27:10.929
- THIS IS A GOOD PLACE.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.689
THIS IS--YOU CAN TELL
IT'S FANCY,

27:12.800 --> 27:18.409

IF I'M GONNA WEAR A TIE,

27:24.850 --> 27:26.181
I WANNA PAY DOUBLE DIGITS

ON MY MIND AND I FEEL BAD.

27:49.660 --> 27:51.662

AND I SAW A PICTURE OF MARK
WITH A GIRL,

27:55.050 --> 27:57.905

WAS SHOCKING.

27:58.020 --> 28:01.251
AND I, YOU KNOW,
IT COULD BE SOMETHING.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.600
IT COULD BE NOTHING.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

28:02.710 --> 28:04.883

I DON'T LIKE IT.

28:38.570 --> 28:40.674

IT WOULD BE MORE FUN.

28:58.250 --> 29:00.696

HOPEFULLY, HE'LL GO TO SLEEP
AT SOME POINT.

32:02.950 --> 32:04.633
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

32:04.750 --> 32:07.366
- OH, JUST THAT HE'S SORRY
AND HE THINKS YOU HATE HIM.

32:07.470 --> 32:09.984
- HE COULD'VE SERIOUSLY
INJURED SYDNEY.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.954
- HONEY, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

IT WAS A METAL BAT.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.068
- WHAT WAS HE THINKING?

32:19.170 --> 32:20.489
- BELIEVE ME,
HE KNOWS HE DID SOMETHING WRONG,

32:20.590 --> 32:24.208
AND HE KNOWS HOW PISSED OFF
YOU ARE AT HIM.

32:24.320 --> 32:27.528
- YOU'RE SAYING
I'M OVERREACTING TO THIS?

32:27.630 --> 32:30.315
- I THINK THAT ONCE
THIS ALL CALMS DOWN,

32:30.430 --> 32:33.388
I THINK HE JUST NEEDS
TO KNOW FROM YOU

32:33.500 --> 32:36.116
THAT IT'S THE BEHAVIOR
YOU'RE UPSET WITH AND NOT HIM.

32:36.230 --> 32:39.324
- WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

32:39.440 --> 32:40.919
NO, THEY'RE NOT
SEPARATE THINGS.

32:41.020 --> 32:42.772
YOU JUDGE PEOPLE
BY THEIR ACTIONS.

32:42.890 --> 32:44.949
- OKAY, WELL, HIS ACTION
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.812
AND SO HE'S GOING TO LEARN
FROM THAT ACCIDENT.

32:46.930 --> 32:48.022
- I THINK WE HAVE
A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM

32:48.130 --> 32:49.540
THAN YOU'RE ADMITTING HERE.

32:53.590 --> 32:55.899
ONE OF OUR CHILDREN
WAS SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED

32:56.000 --> 32:58.343
BY OUR OTHER CHILD,

32:58.450 --> 33:03.069
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT.

33:03.180 --> 33:06.354
I DON'T KNOW
IF WE CAN LIVE LIKE THAT.

TO THIS GAME.

33:31.350 --> 33:32.419
WHOEVER INVENTED THIS GAME--

33:32.520 --> 33:34.488
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THERE'S NO STRATEGY?

33:34.590 --> 33:35.522
IT'S--YOU--

33:35.630 --> 33:36.904

THE GAME,

33:37.010 --> 33:38.693
HE HAD A SHORT DAY THAT DAY.
- [laughing]

33:38.800 --> 33:39.835
HE JUST CAME IN AND SAID,

33:39.940 --> 33:41.043
"ALL RIGHT,
WE NEED ANOTHER GAME."

33:41.150 --> 33:43.015
- SEVEN BEATS SIX!

- OH, MAN!

33:48.020 --> 33:49.817
- A LITTLE MORE.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.364
- WHAT DO YOU GOT GOING ON HERE?
CAN I SEE THESE FOR A SECOND?

33:51.470 --> 33:54.507
LET ME SEE.
- WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33:54.610 --> 33:55.713
OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

33:55.820 --> 33:57.378
THIS IS GONNA BE--
THIS IS GONNA END UP HORRIBLE.

33:59.030 --> 34:00.406
- I CAN'T--
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING NOW.

34:00.520 --> 34:03.409
IS THIS YOUR GLASS?
- OH, WOW. WOW!

34:03.520 --> 34:05.863
YOU KNOW WHAT?
- I CAN'T SEE.

34:05.970 --> 34:08.131
I CAN HEAR YOU.
THAT'S ALL.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.389
THAT'S ONE THING.
I WILL NEVER LOSE YOU.

34:10.490 --> 34:11.479
'CAUSE...

YOU'LL NEVER LOSE ME?

34:13.360 --> 34:14.759
- WELL, BECAUSE I COULD ALWAYS
FOLLOW THE SOUND.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.939

ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS.
