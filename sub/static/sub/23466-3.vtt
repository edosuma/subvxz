13:03.433 --> 13:08.167
How could they do this?
Why would they do this?

13:08.300 --> 13:11.067
David was right.

13:11.200 --> 13:15.133

-[sheriff] David...

13:18.133 --> 13:19.667

Do you know
if any of them were killed?
They didn't look too hot.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.633
You boys did kill some.

13:39.733 --> 13:43.467
This is their fault.
We're not the bad guys here.

have you got?

13:50.067 --> 13:53.367
David? You there?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.467
God is on His throne,
looking down on us right now.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.567
David, how many casualties
do you--

13:58.700 --> 14:01.533
When it says in Revelation 22...

14:01.667 --> 14:06.600
"Behold, I come quickly.
My reward is with Me..."

14:06.733 --> 14:09.533
what reward did Christ receive
in heaven from the Father?

14:09.667 --> 14:12.067
-I don't know.
-The Seven Seals, Jack.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.733
David, we have all the time
in the world to talk theology.

14:15.867 --> 14:17.900
What I wanna talk about
right now

14:18.067 --> 14:19.800
is resolving this thing
peacefully

14:19.933 --> 14:21.533
and getting you
the help you need.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.867
That's what you don't
understand.

14:24.067 --> 14:28.733
We don't have
all the time in the world.

14:28.867 --> 14:29.733
It's begun.

14:29.867 --> 14:32.867
What's begun?

14:33.067 --> 14:35.067
-I gotta go.
-No, David, hang on.

You go out there.
You find someone
who understands.

-Show you what it is

15:13.767 --> 15:16.567
in a shootout with members
of a religious cult.

-...law enforcement officials
descended

15:21.600 --> 15:23.167

15:36.333 --> 15:37.933
No one knows where Gent is.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.267
Then there's you, Judy, Perry.
You're all wounded really bad.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.167
[David] I'll be just fine.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.433
-[faint helicopter blades

-What about the children?

15:46.567 --> 15:48.700
[Steve] None of them are hurt.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.133
Thank God.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.067
We should figure out a way
to get the three of you

15:52.200 --> 15:55.533
-to a hospital
as soon as possible
-You think we can just leave?

15:55.667 --> 15:57.900
-We shot and killed the law.
-Yeah, but they shot first.

15:58.067 --> 16:00.267
-That doesn't matter.
-Well, then I'll call Harwell.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.833
I'll tell him
to send in paramedics.
We know that he's on our side.

16:02.967 --> 16:06.233
-No one's on our side!
-Look, I'm with Dave on this.

16:06.367 --> 16:09.833
Till we figure out
what the heck is going on,
we can't let anyone in here.

16:09.967 --> 16:12.067
That's easy
for you to say, Wayne.
Your wife's not the one

16:12.167 --> 16:13.900
with bullet holes in her.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.800
David, Perry's in bad shape.
We need you.

16:16.933 --> 16:19.067
David, please.
Let me call the paramedics.

16:19.167 --> 16:22.867
-Have Harwell bring them in
-[yells] Everyone just stop!

16:23.067 --> 16:24.233
Stop!

16:24.367 --> 16:28.900
I can't concentrate
with all this talking.

16:29.067 --> 16:31.067
Get out!

16:31.133 --> 16:32.900
[groans] Ugh!

16:33.067 --> 16:37.767
Get out!

16:37.900 --> 16:38.967
You, too! Go!

16:39.100 --> 16:44.833
-David, I have--
-Go!

16:44.967 --> 16:49.167
[grunts, whines]

16:49.300 --> 16:53.767
[grunts]

16:53.900 --> 16:55.067
Damn it!

17:08.433 --> 17:10.533
[touch tones beeping]

17:16.567 --> 17:18.867
[line ringing]

17:19.067 --> 17:24.800
[ringing]

17:24.933 --> 17:26.633
[clicks]

17:26.767 --> 17:28.100
[recording]
Hey, it's Bonnie Sue.
Leave a message.

17:28.233 --> 17:29.667
[beeps]

17:41.367 --> 17:42.700
[sniffles]

17:42.833 --> 17:46.367
Mama? They shot me.
I think I'm dying.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.833
[sobbing]

17:50.967 --> 17:54.333
[sniffles]
Say hi to Grandma for me...

17:54.467 --> 17:57.067
[sobs]

17:57.133 --> 18:01.333
[sniffles]
...and I'll be back real soon.

18:01.467 --> 18:06.667
Okay? [sniffles]

18:06.800 --> 18:11.500
And... I'm sorry
you didn't learn
the Seven Seals.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.567
But I will... show--

18:16.700 --> 18:20.067
I will show you mercy...
[sniffles]

18:20.200 --> 18:24.167
and God will show you mercy,
too, okay?

18:24.300 --> 18:26.567
[sniffles]

18:34.833 --> 18:39.333
And I'll see y'all
up in the skies.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.067
I love you.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.833
[handset clicks]

19:03.767 --> 19:05.200
Road's closed.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.067
I gotta get through.
My wife and kids are in there.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.067
Can't let you in.
Move along.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.500
Move it along. Let's go.

19:12.633 --> 19:16.867
-Yes, sir.
-[radio chatter transmitting]

19:17.067 --> 19:18.933
-[Perry wincing]
-Hey, Daddy,

19:19.067 --> 19:21.600
we have to keep
a little pressure on here
right now, okay?

19:21.733 --> 19:23.300
[Perry grunting]

19:23.433 --> 19:25.667
[gasping]

19:31.367 --> 19:34.233
-How you doing?
-Ain't gonna lie to ya. It--

19:34.367 --> 19:37.233
it hurts real bad.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.600
[grunts] I--

19:38.733 --> 19:42.833
I don't know how much more
I can take.

19:42.967 --> 19:45.067
I have to figure
a few things out.

19:45.167 --> 19:48.233
-[gasping]
-I want you to hang in there
for us.

19:48.367 --> 19:51.500
-Okay?
-[gasps]

19:51.633 --> 19:56.633
[Perry stammering]

19:56.767 --> 20:01.200
-Okay?
-[gasps] Okay. Okay. Okay.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.967
[Thibodeau] Is that Mike?

20:10.233 --> 20:13.433
Kathy!

20:13.567 --> 20:15.867
Kathy! Kathy, Mike!

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
-What?
-He's outside.

20:22.733 --> 20:25.000
Hey, can somebody open the door?

20:25.133 --> 20:27.567
Mike. Come on.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.700
-[gunfire crackles]
-No--!

20:36.200 --> 20:37.033
[whimpering]

20:37.167 --> 20:42.767
[Kathy sobbing]

20:42.900 --> 20:45.967
[Kathy screaming] No!

20:46.100 --> 20:49.500
No! [sobbing]

20:52.033 --> 20:56.267
[Kathy] No! They shot him...

20:56.400 --> 20:57.767
No.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.333
-[Kathy sobbing]
They shot him...!
-No.

21:16.833 --> 21:18.467
Tony Prince, SAC.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.500
Mitch Decker, Tactical.

21:20.633 --> 21:23.333
-Gary Noesner, Lead Negotiator.
-Come on.

21:23.467 --> 21:27.667
-You up to speed?
-[Mitch] Pretty much.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.600
Have we established contact?

21:29.733 --> 21:33.933
There's been
some preliminary talks
between Koresh and the ATF,

21:34.067 --> 21:37.133
but our guys
are still setting up.

21:37.267 --> 21:40.100
How should I coordinate
Negotiations and Tactical?

21:40.233 --> 21:43.067
All communications
go through me.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.800
I'd prefer
if I spoke with Mitch directly.

21:45.933 --> 21:47.467
That way,
we're always on the same page.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.300
-I find that--
-I don't care what you find.

21:50.433 --> 21:52.267
You go through me.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.133
-That's how we're doing it.
-[Mitch] Copy that.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.500
We're still in the process
of securing a perimeter.

22:01.633 --> 22:04.133
-We're just about
to lock it down--
-We'll secure the perimeter.

22:04.267 --> 22:07.100
Well, if you want,
we could help you guys--

22:07.233 --> 22:10.167
No, you've done enough already.
We'll take it from here.

22:18.067 --> 22:20.167
[man] No, that is not
what I was saying.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.867
If you just could put David
back on the phone

22:22.067 --> 22:25.067
we could get
to the bottom of this--

22:25.200 --> 22:30.233
Wait. No.
No, that is not an emergency.
This is an emergen--

22:30.367 --> 22:32.667
Hello?

22:32.800 --> 22:34.600
Operator just cut me off.

22:34.733 --> 22:37.733
Saying they had
an emergency phone call
from "A Current Affair."

22:37.867 --> 22:39.500
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

22:39.633 --> 22:41.633
Well, let's cut
the outside lines
and run our own.

22:41.767 --> 22:46.833
-I want their
undivided attention.
-Okay.

22:46.967 --> 22:48.100
We've met before, haven't we?

22:48.233 --> 22:50.733
Yeah, we sure have.
You trained me.

22:50.867 --> 22:54.367
Walter Graves.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.533
So, what's the deal
with that Prince fella?

22:56.667 --> 22:58.367
I didn't get
the fuzziest feeling
from him.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.400
Yeah. He's not really
a "fuzzy feeling" kinda guy.

23:01.533 --> 23:04.067
He's out of San Antonio,
like me, but prepare yourself.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.967
He's a piece of work.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.633
All right.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.900
I told you. I told you
the element of surprise
was blown.

23:11.067 --> 23:13.167
-I told you that.
-That's not
what I heard you say.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.733
I told you, I said--
I said they knew
you were coming.

23:15.867 --> 23:19.300
-I told you to call it off, man.
-You shoulda been more clear.

23:19.433 --> 23:21.100
What?
What's more clear than that?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.567
You didn't tell me
they were arming up!

23:23.700 --> 23:26.767
They weren't, man. They weren't.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.467
They weren't arming up.

23:34.167 --> 23:36.233
Look, we've already
been through a lot today.

23:36.367 --> 23:40.767
Let's-- let's not
go at each other right now.

23:40.900 --> 23:45.600
-Let me just go back in, then.
-No. I can't do that.

23:45.733 --> 23:47.867
Come on. What do you mean,
you can't do that?

23:48.067 --> 23:49.900
Let me just talk to them.
I know I can convince them
to come out.

23:50.067 --> 23:52.833
I told you, I can't do it.
It's in the hands of the FBI.

23:52.967 --> 23:56.067
Yeah. Right.

23:56.133 --> 23:59.067
[door closes]

23:59.133 --> 24:03.433
If we do surrender,
what are we facing?

24:03.567 --> 24:05.633
Manslaughter.

24:05.767 --> 24:08.633
Murder.
Depends on how hard
they wanna go.

24:08.767 --> 24:11.200
But they shot first.
We were defending ourselves.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.400
Good luck getting them
to admit that.

24:13.533 --> 24:18.067
Is there any chance
we get a fair shake?

24:18.200 --> 24:21.300
In my opinion, no.

24:21.433 --> 24:25.400
-Can they take the children?
-If we're arrested, yeah.

24:27.767 --> 24:32.367
I feel like we gotta call 911,
but...

24:32.500 --> 24:35.133
who do you call when it's
your own government attacking?

24:35.267 --> 24:36.633
[man on radio]
The thing I don't get,

24:36.767 --> 24:39.067
this seemed to be
a military operation

24:39.167 --> 24:42.133
against US citizens--
which is completely illegal,
by the way.

24:42.267 --> 24:45.933
There's a law against that.
It's called posse comitatus.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.267
And your cousin Bubba
might be like,

24:47.400 --> 24:49.067
"Ron, why you gettin'
so worked up?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.733
Basically the same thing,
ain't it?'

24:50.867 --> 24:54.567
No. It's not the same thing.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.900
Law enforcement
and military force

24:57.067 --> 24:58.867
are two
very different functions.

24:59.067 --> 25:03.567
Law enforcement is all about
de-escalating conflict.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.367
You aren't allowed to shoot
unless shot at.

25:05.500 --> 25:09.533
They strive toward
a peaceful conclusion, you know?

25:09.667 --> 25:12.400
Military force...
on the other hand,

25:12.533 --> 25:16.467
is about inflicting
more pain on an enemy
than he can inflict on you.

25:16.600 --> 25:20.967
So I ask you,
why is our government...

25:21.100 --> 25:26.133
-using military force--
-[knocking]

25:26.267 --> 25:29.500
...on civilians?
Folks, you're never
gonna believe this,

25:29.633 --> 25:33.300
but I have David Koresh
on the line right now.

25:33.433 --> 25:37.400
Mr. Koresh?
Mr. Koresh, are you there?

25:37.533 --> 25:41.900
[David] Yes, I am.
What's left of me, anyways.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.667
Can you tell us
what happened today?

25:43.800 --> 25:46.567
What happened today
was un-American.

25:46.700 --> 25:51.833
-How are you guys
holding up there?
-[grunts] Not good.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.300
There's a bunch of us shot dead.
You know, we have kids in here.

25:55.433 --> 25:57.400
Get the lines consolidated yet?

25:57.533 --> 26:00.367
Almost. I asked HRT for help.
They said they'd get on it.

26:00.500 --> 26:03.067
Yeah, don't expect any favors
from those guys.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.100
Koresh is on the radio.

26:05.233 --> 26:09.067
Why can he still call out?
I don't want him
committing suicide on live air.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.200
Mitch!

26:11.333 --> 26:12.567
-Mitch?
-You got that secure?

26:12.700 --> 26:14.367
Hey, didn't my guy ask you
to cut the line?

26:14.500 --> 26:16.200
Getting to it.
Still securing the perimeter.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.100
Cut it!
What's the matter with you?

26:18.233 --> 26:21.167
Cut the line!
They're on the radio!

26:21.300 --> 26:24.633
Somebody cut the line. Over.
Cut the line!

26:24.767 --> 26:26.233
[static crackles]

26:26.367 --> 26:28.500
[David] And I never planned
on using those weapons.

26:28.633 --> 26:32.667
And the problem is,
the people on the outside
don't understand what we bel--

26:32.800 --> 26:34.567
[Ron] David...?
David, are you there?

26:34.700 --> 26:37.433
-Line's cut.
-All right. Re-establish
a connection

26:37.567 --> 26:41.833
Get me on the phone with Koresh.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.700
They cut us off.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.467
[softly] Humph.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.900
[bangs]

26:50.067 --> 26:53.167
-[David sighs]
-[phone rings]

26:59.067 --> 27:04.133
[rings]

27:04.267 --> 27:08.900
[grunts]

27:09.067 --> 27:10.933
Hello.

27:11.067 --> 27:15.633
-Hello. Whom am I speaking with?
-This is David...
"The Notorious."

27:15.767 --> 27:18.500
Hi, David. This is Gary, FBI.

27:18.633 --> 27:20.900
Hey, Gary. How you doing?

27:21.067 --> 27:25.333
Mm, you know, I suppose
we've both had better days.

27:25.467 --> 27:28.833
Yeah. You're telling me.

27:28.967 --> 27:30.467
Yeah.

27:30.600 --> 27:35.067
How do you say your name, David?
Is it Kor-esh or Kor-esh?

27:35.133 --> 27:41.100
You ever hear someone
die before, Gary?

27:41.233 --> 27:42.833
Unfortunately, yes. I have.

27:42.967 --> 27:46.833
Then you say my name
like the last breath
of a dying man.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.867
Like a death knell.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.800
[hissing] Ko-resh-shh-hh.

27:55.500 --> 27:59.667
[Gary] I got it. "Ko-resh-hh."

27:59.800 --> 28:03.133
Well. as I said,
I'm with the FBI, not the ATF.

28:03.267 --> 28:04.867
We're in charge of this now.

28:05.067 --> 28:07.800
Isn't that like
getting in a fight
with the neighbor boy

28:07.933 --> 28:09.367
and he whips you,

28:09.500 --> 28:12.767
and his big brother comes over
to investigate?

28:12.900 --> 28:16.900
[Gary]
No, it's not like that at all.

28:17.067 --> 28:21.233
Tell me, Gary...

28:21.367 --> 28:22.967
you gonna come kill us all?

28:23.100 --> 28:25.067
No.

28:25.167 --> 28:27.867
I'm here to work this out
with words, not bullets.

28:28.067 --> 28:30.633
Well, why didn't you do that
in the first place?

28:30.767 --> 28:33.900
When I was out in town,
or jogging?

28:34.067 --> 28:37.300
Jacob Vasquez knew that.

28:37.433 --> 28:43.433
David, I can't tell you
the answer to that, because
I wasn't involved.

28:43.567 --> 28:45.067
[David] Put Jacob on the phone.

28:45.133 --> 28:48.067
Well, I wish I could,
but he's not here.

28:48.167 --> 28:50.900
[grunts]

28:51.067 --> 28:53.933
Now, David,
I hear you're injured.

28:54.067 --> 28:57.300
And I'd like
to get you medical attention.
We just need you to come out.

28:57.433 --> 29:01.133
Come out?
After what you did to us?

29:01.267 --> 29:04.067
After you came in
and shot us for no reason?

29:04.133 --> 29:05.967
Well, like I said, we're FBI.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.233
We had absolutely nothing
to do with that.

29:08.367 --> 29:13.200
[Gary] Although,
it's my understanding that
your people ambushed the ATF.

29:13.333 --> 29:14.767
That is a lie!

29:14.900 --> 29:17.933
This is all their fault.
You don't believe me,

29:18.067 --> 29:20.867
There was a guy right outside
with a video camera.

29:21.067 --> 29:24.067
You go watch that tape.

29:24.167 --> 29:25.467
Fair enough.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.567
[Gary] Well, let's try
and get past this, okay?

29:27.700 --> 29:30.800
Tell me what I need to do
to get you out of there.

29:30.933 --> 29:34.467
Hm. In Psalms 2,

29:34.600 --> 29:37.467
it says David
has a vision of the future--

29:37.600 --> 29:41.200
of confrontation
between man and man's law

29:41.333 --> 29:44.733
and God and God's law.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.400
-Okay.
-And Revelation 13 tells

29:47.533 --> 29:51.933
of a "lamb-like beast"
who will rise up.

29:52.067 --> 29:53.933
Tell me, Gary...

29:54.067 --> 29:58.067
what empire is lamb-like,
or Christian?

30:01.767 --> 30:05.400
The United States of America.

30:05.533 --> 30:06.767
[David] The leaders of the earth

30:06.900 --> 30:09.967
will join in counsel together

30:10.100 --> 30:13.533
against the Lord,
against His anointed.

30:13.667 --> 30:17.633
The message in Psalms 2
is clear, Gary.

30:17.767 --> 30:19.400
Seems like you know the Bible
back to front.

30:19.533 --> 30:22.867
-I memorized every word of it.
-And you know, it also seems

30:23.000 --> 30:25.933
like you have a message.

30:26.067 --> 30:27.933
Our purpose here, Gary,

30:28.067 --> 30:32.900
-is that message.
-Well, what if I could help you?

30:33.033 --> 30:35.733
What if I can convince
my commanders

30:35.867 --> 30:39.567
to let you share your message
with the world?

30:39.700 --> 30:42.733
Would you come out then?

30:42.867 --> 30:47.367
When you say, "world,"
do you mean national TV?

30:49.333 --> 30:52.167
Sure.

30:52.300 --> 30:54.567
You broadcast my message
on national TV,

30:54.700 --> 30:58.467
then yeah, I'll come out.

31:01.100 --> 31:05.500
Okay. Let's be clear.
If I make this happen,

31:05.633 --> 31:07.200
you will peacefully surrender?

31:07.333 --> 31:09.367
You're agreeing to that?

31:19.433 --> 31:22.867
Yeah. You have yourself a deal.

31:31.233 --> 31:35.400
[murmuring]

31:35.533 --> 31:38.133
Can I have
everybody's attention?

31:38.267 --> 31:41.400
Please. Look, I know. I know.
It's been a...

31:41.533 --> 31:43.833
it's been a long, awful day.

31:43.967 --> 31:47.400
But I do have some good news.

31:47.533 --> 31:48.933
David has spoken to the FBI,

31:49.067 --> 31:54.067
-and they've come to a deal.
-What? What kinda deal?-

31:54.200 --> 31:58.367
So David is-- is gonna make
a recording of our message.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.967
And after it airs
on national television,

32:02.100 --> 32:04.300
then we're all gonna come out.

32:04.433 --> 32:07.600
We all going to jail?

32:07.733 --> 32:10.900
Honestly,
I-- I don't know, Kathy.

32:11.067 --> 32:13.067
They can't make us leave here.
This is our home.

32:13.167 --> 32:15.067
[Steve] Nobody is saying
that we can't come back here.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.533
This is just the deal
that David made

32:17.667 --> 32:19.933
in order to bring this situation
to a close.

32:20.067 --> 32:23.300
You should all
pack up whatever...

32:23.433 --> 32:25.167
you know, belongings
you wanna take with you

32:25.300 --> 32:28.667
and be prepared to leave
in the morning.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.133
That's it.

32:39.900 --> 32:42.067
How's he doing?

32:42.167 --> 32:45.100
He's going in and out.

32:45.233 --> 32:48.800
Do you need a break?
I could sit with him
for a while.

32:48.933 --> 32:50.933
No, I'm not going anywhere.

32:51.067 --> 32:56.500
Well, I could stay with you...
if that's all right.

32:56.633 --> 32:59.833
[faintly] Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.

33:16.733 --> 33:21.533
[door closes]

33:21.667 --> 33:23.733
Mind if we have
an "off-the-record"?

33:30.633 --> 33:32.433
[sighs]

33:32.567 --> 33:37.800
I hear you spent some time
with those guys.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.867
A little.

33:40.067 --> 33:45.167
Well, the ATF says
they were shot at first.

33:45.300 --> 33:48.433
Koresh says the ATF fired first.

33:48.567 --> 33:51.967
Any idea
who's telling the truth?

33:52.100 --> 33:55.800
I wasn't there.

33:55.933 --> 34:00.833
Koresh mentioned you guys
had someone filming the raid.
That true?

34:00.967 --> 34:04.067
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

34:04.200 --> 34:06.633
Both sides seem to trust ya.

34:11.567 --> 34:16.300
Yep, there was a--
there was a camera guy there.

34:16.433 --> 34:19.267
Now, you think I could see
that tape?

34:19.400 --> 34:23.833
I really need
to have my facts straight
before I talk to him.

34:23.967 --> 34:27.333
-I heard it went missing.
-Missing?

34:27.467 --> 34:30.967
Yeah. As soon as
the confusion started...

34:31.100 --> 34:33.300
the tape just went missing.

34:37.967 --> 34:40.400
[sighs]

34:40.533 --> 34:42.800
[David] It's happening, Rachel.

34:42.933 --> 34:47.200
The whole world is gonna hear
my message.

34:47.333 --> 34:51.600
And just imagine
what's gonna happen
when they do.

34:51.733 --> 34:55.100
It's gonna be unlike anything
they've ever known.

34:55.233 --> 34:58.567
And then after that?

34:58.700 --> 35:01.833
-What do you mean?
-Mt. Carmel's in your name.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.800
[sighs] Ah...

35:03.933 --> 35:08.567
If you're arrested,
they'll take it away.
And then, where will we go?

35:08.700 --> 35:11.567
-Why would they do that?
-Why are they doing any of this?

35:11.700 --> 35:15.833
This is all we have.

35:15.967 --> 35:17.400
It's all we know.

35:22.100 --> 35:26.700
God will deliver us
to where we need to be.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.400
You need to put your fate
in His hands.

35:30.533 --> 35:34.900
And I'll do whatever it takes
to protect you and our children
from the law.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.500
[Rachel sniffling]

35:36.633 --> 35:40.800
But I can't protect you
from God's plan.

35:40.933 --> 35:45.633
Ready?

35:45.767 --> 35:47.700
-[Rachel sniffling]
-Yeah.

35:47.833 --> 35:49.367
-[sniffling]
-You all right?

35:49.500 --> 35:51.333
Yeah.

35:57.067 --> 36:00.333
Let's do it.

36:00.467 --> 36:01.700
Yeah.
It looks like it's winding down.

36:01.833 --> 36:04.067
We're just waiting for 'em
to come out.

36:04.133 --> 36:05.867
Well, hopefully tonight.

36:06.067 --> 36:09.067
Hey, I gotta go,
but I'll see you tomorrow.

36:09.133 --> 36:11.433
I love you, too. Bye.

36:11.567 --> 36:13.100
-Your wife?
-Yeah.

36:13.233 --> 36:15.567
Yeah.

36:15.700 --> 36:18.300
Let me give you
a little piece of advice, okay?

36:18.433 --> 36:21.900
Never say you're coming home
until you're on your way.

36:22.067 --> 36:27.667
Underpromise, overdeliver.
Everyone's happier that way.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.067
[sips]

36:30.133 --> 36:31.633
[chuckles]

36:31.767 --> 36:33.933
When God says, "Hearken to Me,

36:34.067 --> 36:35.933
you who seek after
righteousness,

36:36.067 --> 36:38.067
you who seek the Lord.

36:38.133 --> 36:40.800
Look to the rock."

36:40.933 --> 36:44.067
The Lord is that Rock
and He is on his throne
and He says--

36:44.167 --> 36:47.800
[voices laughing]

36:47.933 --> 36:50.900
-What's wrong?
-[recorder clicks]

36:51.067 --> 36:52.867
[voices overlapping]

36:57.333 --> 36:58.367
[yells] What are you doing?

36:58.500 --> 37:00.967
[talking stops]

37:01.100 --> 37:02.100
[panting]

37:02.233 --> 37:06.367
[yells] People died today!

37:06.500 --> 37:09.500
They died protecting you!

37:09.633 --> 37:13.233
Their bodies
are in the next room over.

37:13.367 --> 37:15.833
Go on, take a look at 'em!

37:15.967 --> 37:19.067
Go!

37:19.133 --> 37:20.733
Y'all should be mourning

37:20.867 --> 37:26.633
and praying for the souls
that we lost, not celebrating.

37:26.767 --> 37:30.833
Y'all should be
ashamed of yourselves.

37:30.967 --> 37:35.867
David, it's Perry. We need you.

37:36.067 --> 37:38.800
Okay. Okay.

37:42.067 --> 37:44.133
[grunts]

37:44.267 --> 37:45.333
[Perry] David...?

37:45.467 --> 37:47.200
[gulping]

37:47.333 --> 37:51.267
My time's done here.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.767
[Perry gasping]

37:52.900 --> 37:55.100
I need you to hang on
a little longer, okay?

37:55.233 --> 37:58.200
[gasping]
I ain't-- I ain't gonna make it.

37:58.333 --> 38:00.667
[gasping, panting]

38:09.600 --> 38:13.833
Okay.
Let's get you outta here.

38:13.967 --> 38:18.700
I wanna die here...
not out there.

38:18.833 --> 38:21.067
I want the last faces I see

38:21.167 --> 38:23.600
to be faces I love.

38:23.733 --> 38:26.667
Not ones I hate. [coughing]

38:31.267 --> 38:33.967
Davey...

38:34.100 --> 38:36.700
take your sisters downstairs.

38:36.833 --> 38:39.133
-Come on, darlin'.
-No.

38:43.800 --> 38:47.433
[whimpering]

38:47.567 --> 38:53.133
[Rachel sobs]

38:53.267 --> 38:56.500
-We love you, Daddy.
-I love you, too.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.333
Please... please...?

39:05.467 --> 39:08.233
Please make it stop. [gasping]

39:19.367 --> 39:23.467
Blessed be the God
and Father of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.633
The Father of mercies,

39:25.767 --> 39:27.400
and God of all comfort...

39:27.533 --> 39:28.767
[Perry panting]

39:28.900 --> 39:30.667
...who comforts us
in all our tribulations,

39:30.800 --> 39:35.100
that we may be able
to comfort those...

39:35.233 --> 39:38.167
that are in any trouble.

39:38.300 --> 39:42.200
Amen. Thank you.

39:42.333 --> 39:45.467
I will see you again.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.233
I know.

39:48.367 --> 39:52.200
[gasps]

39:52.333 --> 39:54.267
[gasps]

40:06.600 --> 40:10.967
[gunshot echoes]

40:11.100 --> 40:12.967
[faint sobbing]

40:30.967 --> 40:32.933
[voices murmuring]

40:42.967 --> 40:46.067
Excuse me.

40:46.200 --> 40:49.467
[sighs]

40:49.600 --> 40:54.033
-Well, you don't
look like an ATF agent.
-[woman chuckles]

40:54.167 --> 40:55.900
-Goodness, no.
-[sighs]

40:56.033 --> 40:58.767
My son's in there.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.467
Mine, too.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.233
-Who's your son?
-David Thibodeau.

41:04.367 --> 41:06.700
Oh.

41:06.833 --> 41:08.267
Well, he's a real nice boy.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.133
-You know him?
-Oh, yeah.

41:11.267 --> 41:14.233
Yeah. He's real sweet
with my grandkids.

41:14.367 --> 41:16.233
Got 13 in there.

41:16.367 --> 41:19.800
[sniffles]

41:19.933 --> 41:24.067
Wait, are you...
David Koresh's mother?

41:26.067 --> 41:28.067
[softly]
Don't say that too loud.

41:37.267 --> 41:40.200
Excuse me, I'm gonna...

41:40.333 --> 41:44.333
I'm gonna go
and use the restroom.
I'm gonna be back, okay?

41:49.933 --> 41:51.567
Ahem.

41:51.700 --> 41:53.700
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[murmuring stops]

41:53.833 --> 41:55.833
Earlier today...

41:55.967 --> 41:59.467
the ATF was ambushed
as we tried to serve
a routine search warrant

41:59.600 --> 42:02.533
for what we believed to be
a dangerous cult...

42:02.667 --> 42:06.933
who were illegally
modifying weapons
for an End-of-Days assault.

42:07.067 --> 42:10.267
Known as the Branch Davidians...

42:10.400 --> 42:15.067
these people believe
their charismatic leader,
David Koresh,

42:15.133 --> 42:17.267
is the Messiah.

42:17.400 --> 42:20.600
We had an undercover agent
who had infiltrated
their compound,

42:20.733 --> 42:25.133
but unfortunately,
he didn't warn us that the cult
was planning an attack.

42:25.267 --> 42:27.100
[camera shutter clicks]

42:27.233 --> 42:31.167
We also now believe
that he might have been
compromised by the group.

42:31.300 --> 42:36.067
The ATF will be
investigating that matter
further in the days to come.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.333
Negotiations have since
been turned over to the FBI.

42:39.467 --> 42:41.467
Special Agent Tony Prince
is here with me

42:41.600 --> 42:45.167
to let you know where things
currently stand.

42:45.300 --> 42:47.333
Thank you. Good morning.

42:47.467 --> 42:50.633
My team is now in charge
of bringing this situation
to an end

42:50.767 --> 42:53.067
and we have hope
that it will be over soon.

42:53.200 --> 42:57.600
One of our negotiators
was able to strike a deal
with Mr. Koresh.

42:57.733 --> 43:01.400
In exchange for his surrender,
we have agreed to play

43:01.533 --> 43:05.100
an audiotape
from Koresh himself.

43:05.233 --> 43:06.767
It's almost an hour long,

43:06.900 --> 43:10.733
but per our end of the bargain,
here it is.

43:10.867 --> 43:12.833
[whispers] Go ahead.

43:12.967 --> 43:14.933
[recording] I, David Koresh,

43:15.067 --> 43:18.600
agree, upon
the broadcasting of this tape,
to come out, peacefully,

43:18.733 --> 43:21.867
with all the people,
immediately.

43:22.067 --> 43:24.167
The first thing I'd like
to introduce in our subject

43:24.300 --> 43:28.267
is the reasons
for the revelations
of Jesus Christ.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.267
-[camera shutter clicks]
-In the Book of Revelation

43:30.400 --> 43:32.767
commentary states
that what John has written
in Scripture

43:32.900 --> 43:37.067
is nothing other than
the revelation of Jesus Christ.

43:37.133 --> 43:40.233
[recording echoes over PA]
We see in Chapter Five
that John begins to weep

43:40.367 --> 43:43.067
until one of the others says,
"Weep not."

43:43.167 --> 43:45.267
[recording on TV]
"'Behold, the Lion
of the tribe Judah,

43:45.400 --> 43:47.667
the Root of David.'

43:47.800 --> 43:50.767
And John beheld the Lamb
as it had been slain

43:50.900 --> 43:54.200
in the midst of the throne
of the four beasts

43:54.333 --> 43:57.533
and the elders, with seven eyes
and seven horns."

43:57.667 --> 44:00.067
What's the meaning
of these things?

44:00.133 --> 44:02.333
What is the meaning?

44:02.467 --> 44:04.967
The tape you ran,
um, I think most of us heard,

44:05.100 --> 44:09.367
was a rambling discourse
that went on for what,
58 minutes, almost an hour.

44:09.500 --> 44:13.367
Would you have run it
if not urged to do so
by the authorities?

44:13.500 --> 44:14.833
-[man] I doubt it.
-[clicks]

44:14.967 --> 44:16.900
Howell thinks
he's the Lamb of God,

44:17.067 --> 44:19.467
when all he is is a cheap thug

44:19.600 --> 44:21.700
who interprets the Bible
through the barrel of a--

44:21.833 --> 44:23.833
[reporter]
...released a rambling
hour-long recording

44:23.967 --> 44:26.300
outlining his views
of the Book of Revelation,

44:26.433 --> 44:28.967
and told authorities
he would surrender if--

44:29.100 --> 44:33.100
How do you prove to someone
that he is not Jesus Christ
incarnate?

44:33.233 --> 44:36.367
Well, the FBI said today
that is the challenge it faces

44:36.500 --> 44:38.400
in dealing with cult leader
David Koresh...

44:38.533 --> 44:40.400
[whispers] David, you all right?

44:40.533 --> 44:42.933
[man on TV]
...would like to prove
that David is not Christ.

44:43.067 --> 44:45.233
[TV reporter]
Federal authorities
have brought in reinforcements.

44:45.367 --> 44:50.667
There are
about 200 lawmen here now.
Negotiations are continuing...

44:50.800 --> 44:53.100
[David grunts]

44:53.233 --> 44:54.667
Ts-ss.

44:59.900 --> 45:02.933
[murmuring]

45:03.067 --> 45:05.133
I did everything
you asked me to...

45:05.267 --> 45:08.433
-and you burned me.
-You burned yourself.

45:08.567 --> 45:11.833
[Jacob] That's bullshit.
Come on, guys, you heard me
call it off. Tell him.

45:11.967 --> 45:13.533
Tell him!

45:13.667 --> 45:16.433
Oh, so that's how it is?
Fifteen years of loyalty?

45:16.567 --> 45:19.700
Fifteen years of putting my life
on the line, and then for what?

45:19.833 --> 45:22.567
For what? Hey--!
Hey, get your hands off me, man.

45:22.700 --> 45:23.867
Get off me.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.733
[birds chirping]

45:46.067 --> 45:49.700
[phone ringing]

45:49.833 --> 45:53.700
[ringing]

45:53.833 --> 45:58.400
[ringing stops]

45:58.533 --> 46:02.333
-This is David.
-Hey, David. It's Gary.

46:02.467 --> 46:05.500
Our buses
are ready to come pick you up,
but before they do,

46:05.633 --> 46:09.067
there's a procedure
I'd like to go over
with you first.

46:09.200 --> 46:14.067
-Now, it's important to remem--
-You ever see
"The Lawnmower Man," Gary?

46:14.167 --> 46:17.900
-No, David, I haven't.
-Oh, it's a good movie.

46:18.067 --> 46:19.833
You should see it.

46:19.967 --> 46:22.067
It's about a simple man...

46:22.200 --> 46:27.067
that grows an understanding
that changes the world.

46:27.167 --> 46:29.667
Nobody treats him good at first.

46:29.800 --> 46:34.933
They make fun of him
and call him names.

46:35.067 --> 46:38.167
But in time...

46:38.300 --> 46:44.333
they soon realize
that he has a power
that none of 'em understood.

46:44.467 --> 46:49.633
You see, he taps into something.

46:49.767 --> 46:55.200
Something that changes
the fabric of reality.

46:55.333 --> 47:01.133
And you know
what they try to do to him
when they realize that?

47:01.267 --> 47:03.867
They try to get rid of him.

47:04.067 --> 47:06.600
They burn it all down.

47:06.733 --> 47:09.667
The telephones will ring, Gary.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.767
The telephones will ring.

47:12.900 --> 47:16.333
I don't understand.

47:16.467 --> 47:18.900
God spoke to me.

47:19.067 --> 47:23.200
We ain't coming out.

47:23.333 --> 47:23.933
[handset bangs]
