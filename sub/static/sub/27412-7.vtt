The Hotel Denouement, please.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.166
The Hotel Denouement
burned down in a fire years ago.

01:43.625 --> 01:46.125
It's just a pile of ash.
Why the heck do you want to go there?

01:46.208 --> 01:47.250

You may have noticed in your life

The 13th time
you drink a root beer float,

02:11.500 --> 02:15.500
you may enjoy it less than the first time
because you have become used to the taste

02:15.583 --> 02:18.916
of vanilla ice cream
and root beer mixed together. However...

02:19.750 --> 02:22.458
the 13th time you discover

I have been on the run for many years,

02:40.083 --> 02:42.333
I was once a member
of a secret organization,

02:42.416 --> 02:45.541
along with my friends, my siblings,
and the woman I loved.

02:45.625 --> 02:48.791
Now all of those people
and the organization are gone,

02:48.875 --> 02:51.500

drinking root beer floats alone

02:51.583 --> 02:55.125
as I trace the sad, soggy case
of the Baudelaire orphans.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.541
But now the case has dried up.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.333
I cannot find where the Baudelaires went

03:02.416 --> 03:05.666
when they sailed away
from that burning hotel so many years ago,

03:05.750 --> 03:08.875
nor do I know what's become of them since.

03:08.958 --> 03:11.541
All that I do know
is that in this story...

03:12.625 --> 03:15.916
there are no happy endings,
and in that respect...

03:17.125 --> 03:21.208

So you keep telling us.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.333
The first thing I'll buy is a new car.

03:39.416 --> 03:41.250
Something with a big engine

03:41.333 --> 03:45.708
so I can drive faster than the speed limit
and ram into other cars unsuspected.

If you don't do exactly as I say,

04:07.666 --> 04:12.291
I will break open this diving helmet,

04:12.375 --> 04:15.416

04:43.416 --> 04:45.083
I bet I can chart a course
back to the city.

04:45.166 --> 04:48.625
I can create a compass. All I need is
a piece of magnetized metal and a pivot.

04:48.708 --> 04:50.083
What do we do about Count Olaf?

04:52.500 --> 04:55.958
We may not have a navigational compass,
Sunny, but we still have a moral compass.

We can't just push a person overboard.

As long as he's around, nobody's safe.

07:53.666 --> 07:54.500
[Klaus] Ishmael?

07:54.583 --> 07:57.291
He helps us decide what to keep
and what to throw away.

08:00.541 --> 08:04.041
And what did you find
after the storm, Alonso?

08:04.125 --> 08:05.125
I found this birdcage.

08:05.208 --> 08:08.208
It's pretty big, so I'm guessing
it was used for big birds like eagles.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.083
Since we don't have any birds
on the island,

08:10.166 --> 08:12.500
I'm not sure we have need for a birdcage.

08:12.583 --> 08:15.500
If I were you,
I would throw that useless thing away,

You mean yurts. And they're tents.

-Lies.
-A tedious blowhard.

is not any of a long list

09:17.833 --> 09:20.708
of murders, arsons,
and charges of child endangerment,

09:20.791 --> 09:24.833
but the unbridled arrogance to play a part
for which he was thoroughly unqualified--

-Mean-spirited!

-You can't shoot all these fine people.

of hippies in robes gonna do?

09:48.166 --> 09:50.958

-You don't have any henchpeople.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.083
-They all abandoned you.
-That's right!

Uh...

How about a compromise?

09:55.791 --> 09:59.125

the children. Okay, that didn't go--

Ow!

10:05.583 --> 10:08.666

a use for it after all.

10:09.416 --> 10:13.041
What kind of monster
stuffs someone into a birdcage?

10:15.833 --> 10:17.375
What are you looking at, pipsqueak?

10:18.916 --> 10:20.833
[Ishmael] Take him to the seawall!

10:20.916 --> 10:22.666
We have no room for bad apples here.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.250
Bad apples?

10:26.583 --> 10:29.125
Wait! Baudelaires, you can't let
these people take me away!

10:29.208 --> 10:31.416
Not when I know a secrets about--

10:32.875 --> 10:35.166
[muffled]

10:37.750 --> 10:39.958
So tell me,
how did three children like you

10:40.041 --> 10:41.916
come to be shipwrecked
with a man like that?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.958
-It's a long story.
-Extremely long.

10:45.750 --> 10:46.750
But it's not over yet.

10:46.833 --> 10:48.875
-We have to get back.
-Is there a way off this island?

10:49.333 --> 10:51.375
It depends on how you look at it.

10:51.833 --> 10:54.416
The seawall shelters us from storms,

10:54.500 --> 10:58.625
but I'm afraid sailing over those
sharp rocks, that's nearly impossible.

10:58.708 --> 11:00.250
-So we're stranded.
-Not quite.

11:00.333 --> 11:04.458
You see, once a year, the tide rises
high enough to launch a boat

11:04.541 --> 11:07.166
by sailing it through the lowest point
in that wall.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.583
They call it Decision Day,

11:08.666 --> 11:11.083
and that day happens to be tomorrow.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.208
We have an outrigger--
you see that large canoe?-- standing by,

11:14.291 --> 11:17.291
for anyone who wants to go,
but no one ever does.

11:20.708 --> 11:23.666
There's our flock of sheep.
They were shipwrecked here, too.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.583
-[Klaus] That's a strange color for sheep.
-Common in flamingos,

11:26.666 --> 11:29.416
and like flamingos,
these sheep live on a diet of shrimp

11:29.500 --> 11:32.083
which gives their wool
its unique coral hue.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.333
Same as you see in our robes
and our tents.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.416
[Klaus] Everyone's happy.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.291
It's kind of nice.

11:38.375 --> 11:41.125
You must be exhausted from the storm.
We'll get you some fresh clothes.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.000
You're in luck. Alonso's making--

11:43.083 --> 11:44.666
Ceviche!

11:44.750 --> 11:46.708
It's that South American dish
made from raw seafood

11:46.791 --> 11:48.083
marinated in citrus and spices?

11:48.166 --> 11:50.958
Normally. But we don't have citrus fruits
or spices on the island,

11:51.041 --> 11:52.541
so ours is just plain, raw fish.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.000
My sister wonders
why you don't use fire to cook.

11:57.375 --> 12:00.791
Or eat the sheep. Sorry, she recently
became interested in cooking.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.750
Fire is one of the most dangerous things
in the world.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.291
We wholeheartedly agree.

12:07.416 --> 12:09.291
How did so many people
end up on the island?

12:09.375 --> 12:11.333
I took a cruise
when I was pregnant with Friday.

12:11.416 --> 12:13.708
The ship hit an iceberg,
and I washed up here.

12:13.791 --> 12:16.208
-I got caught in a tempest.
-I got caught in a manatee accident.

12:16.291 --> 12:17.666
Don't you miss your old lives?

12:17.750 --> 12:20.500
I barely remember my old life. It's fuzzy.

12:20.916 --> 12:21.750
Like a dream.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.833
[Ishmael] We have a motto on this island:

12:23.916 --> 12:25.833
"Forget your troubles."

12:26.666 --> 12:28.625
Care for a drink?

12:31.125 --> 12:33.250
It's a cordial made of fermented coconut.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.041
[Klaus clears throat]

12:37.125 --> 12:39.791
I'm not sure we like the taste.
Do we have to drink it?

12:39.875 --> 12:42.750
Well, I won't force you,
but we don't have fresh water here,

12:42.833 --> 12:46.541
so if you don't drink it,
you might die of dehydration.

12:47.083 --> 12:47.958
Well, Ishmael--

12:48.041 --> 12:48.875
Oh, call me Ish.

12:48.958 --> 12:51.166
Are you sure we're safe
from Count Olaf here?

12:51.250 --> 12:53.416
He could escape the cage
and find the harpoon gun, or--

12:53.500 --> 12:54.375
Something worse.

12:55.666 --> 12:57.375
You don't have to worry about that.

12:57.708 --> 13:00.833
We send all the dangerous items
to the other side of the island

13:00.916 --> 13:02.250
so they can't hurt anyone.

13:02.333 --> 13:06.208
As for Count Olaf, well,
we've placed his cage by the seawall,

13:06.291 --> 13:08.625
and tomorrow, when that seawall floods,

13:08.708 --> 13:10.916
Count Olaf will drown.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.041
[Ishmael chortles]

13:13.041 --> 13:13.916
Isn't that cruel?

13:15.708 --> 13:17.750
That depends on how you look at it.

13:25.041 --> 13:26.250
These robes may be comfortable,

13:26.333 --> 13:28.083
but I'm not comfortable
leaving Olaf to drown.

13:28.166 --> 13:30.375
-We're not the ones doing it.
-We're not stopping it either.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.833
With Count Olaf gone, we'd be safe
to go wherever we wanted.

13:32.916 --> 13:36.083
We've been on the run for a long time,
and I'm exhausted.

13:36.166 --> 13:37.875
Ishmael said forget your troubles.

13:38.291 --> 13:39.875
Maybe it's time to start.

13:41.041 --> 13:43.625
[Alonso] Flavorless ceviche
isn't the most exciting meal,

13:43.708 --> 13:46.625
but you haven't lived till you've had
seafood fresh from the ocean!

13:46.708 --> 13:48.708
Have you considered building
a water filtration system?

13:50.291 --> 13:51.375
A water what-now?

13:51.458 --> 13:52.458
A water filtration system

13:52.541 --> 13:55.125
is a device that separates saltwater
into fresh water and salt.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.416
You could drink
something other than coconut cordial,

13:57.500 --> 13:58.833
and have salt to season your food.

13:59.750 --> 14:00.916
Hey, that's a good idea.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.375
To our newest castaways!
To the Baudelaire orphans!

14:04.458 --> 14:06.208
[all] To the Baudelaires!

14:07.375 --> 14:13.250
[slurping]

14:14.875 --> 14:17.583
-[sheep bleating]
-[Ishmael] I suggest we all retire.

14:17.666 --> 14:20.208
Get a good night's sleep
before Decision Day.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.583
I feel a storm coming on.

14:22.666 --> 14:25.750
The storm's blowing suddenly around here.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.666
Violet, would you stay?

14:31.958 --> 14:35.041
So, you had an idea for an invention.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.958
A water filtration system.
It wouldn't be hard.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.291
I bet I could build it
with the items that have washed up.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.458
What if our stomachs
couldn't tolerate fresh water

14:41.541 --> 14:44.000
after drinking nothing
but coconut cordial?

14:44.083 --> 14:47.625
What if we started fighting
over what to drink in the first place?

14:47.708 --> 14:49.166
I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong?

14:49.250 --> 14:52.541
People here had hard lives
before they found this island.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.875
They stay because it's safe,
and they trust me to keep it that way.

14:55.958 --> 14:56.875
It was just an idea.

14:56.958 --> 14:59.750
Yes, but ideas lead to more ideas,

14:59.833 --> 15:02.916
which lead to arguments,
which lead to schisms.

15:04.958 --> 15:08.000
You remember what got you stranded here
to begin with.

15:09.583 --> 15:12.541
Don't rock the boat.

15:15.541 --> 15:18.041
[Klaus] It means don't do anything
that might cause trouble.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.333
Ishmael is trouble. We have to leave.

15:20.958 --> 15:21.916
And go where?

15:22.583 --> 15:26.333
It's not like we have a home waiting.
It's not like we have a home anywhere.

15:26.416 --> 15:28.541
You want to stay where there's
nothing to read or invent?

15:28.625 --> 15:30.458
No! I don't know.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.958
I've been trying to remember
our life with our parents,

15:34.041 --> 15:35.333
but it's all fuzzy like a dream.

15:35.416 --> 15:37.500
It's normal for memories
to fade over time.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.666
I can barely remember
what their faces looked like.

15:40.666 --> 15:42.750
And why did they keep
all these secrets from us?

15:43.166 --> 15:45.333
It's their fault these bad things
keep happening to us!

15:45.416 --> 15:46.666
It's their fault we're...

15:48.416 --> 15:49.291
orphans.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.375
At dinner, Ishmael referred to us
as the Baudelaire orphans.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.125
We never told him
that we lost our parents.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.833
Ishmael's hiding something from us.
We have to find out what.

15:57.916 --> 15:58.958
He's not gonna tell us.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.500
But we know someone who might.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.583
[waves crashing]

16:07.291 --> 16:09.958
[muffled] Well, well, well.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.958
I said, "Well, well, well."

16:15.041 --> 16:18.500
I knew your annoying curiosity
would lead you here eventually.

16:19.666 --> 16:21.125
Did you bring me a banana daiquiri?

16:21.208 --> 16:22.375
We brought you ceviche.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.708
Ugh! This is cold, raw fish!

16:33.541 --> 16:35.625
A fish bone? Are you trying to kill me?

16:35.708 --> 16:36.583
I'm impressed.

16:36.666 --> 16:38.333
You had something to tell us
about Ishmael.

16:38.916 --> 16:42.166
You're not as stupid as you look,
though that would be impossible.

16:44.666 --> 16:48.041
I didn't recognize him at first,
not with that ridiculous beard,

16:48.125 --> 16:49.958
but he recognized me.

16:50.041 --> 16:53.375
That's why he's locked me in here,
so I don't spill his secrets.

16:53.458 --> 16:54.541
What secrets?

16:58.750 --> 17:00.875
Let me out, and I might tell you.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.916
If you tell us, we might let you out.

17:03.916 --> 17:05.041
Let me out first.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.000
Tell us first.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.125
-Let me out first!
-Ishmael is going to let you drown!

17:08.208 --> 17:09.708
If you don't tell us, you will die!

17:09.791 --> 17:11.416
Of course I'm going to die!

17:11.500 --> 17:13.625
That's the way of the world, Baudelaires.

17:14.041 --> 17:16.833
Everybody runs around
with their secrets and their schemes,

17:16.916 --> 17:18.666
trying to outwit one another,

17:19.208 --> 17:20.291
and then they die.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.625
Ishmael has locked me in here,

17:25.708 --> 17:28.833
but if you let me out, I can outwit him,

17:28.916 --> 17:29.916
and then...

17:30.416 --> 17:32.333
you can be my henchfolk.

17:32.791 --> 17:36.250
And we'll take that boat, and we'll
sail back to where the action is!

17:36.333 --> 17:39.041
We don't want to be your henchfolk.
We don't want to play your games.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.791
Come on. He's wasting our time.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.583
Fine. Go.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.958
I'll get out on my own. I always do!

17:48.750 --> 17:52.333
And I'll be back with a new disguise.
The best one yet!

17:52.916 --> 17:56.791
I may be in a cage, Baudelaires,
but I've still got it.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.000
You hear me?

18:00.708 --> 18:01.708
Baudelaires?

18:05.708 --> 18:07.208
Can I at least have a blanket?

18:10.625 --> 18:11.541
[Violet] Ishmael?

18:12.666 --> 18:15.750
-[Klaus] He's gone. He left his boots.
-[Violet] And a trail of footprints.

18:16.875 --> 18:18.708
[Klaus]
Good idea, Sunny. Let's investigate.

18:22.791 --> 18:26.000
[Klaus] Ishmael must be sneaking out
when he thinks everyone is asleep.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.875
[Violet] He's not just keeping
secrets from us.

18:27.958 --> 18:29.666
He's keeping secrets
from the entire colony.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.208
-It's a dead end.
-Maybe not.

18:37.958 --> 18:38.958
I wonder...

18:47.708 --> 18:49.791
[Klaus] This must lead
to the other side of the island.

18:49.875 --> 18:52.500
[Violet] That's where Ishmael said
he sends everything dangerous.

19:03.958 --> 19:06.208
All these items
must have washed up on the seawall.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.291
Ishmael said they were dangerous
and sent them here.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.583
[Violet] Think of what you could invent
with all this.

19:15.666 --> 19:16.541
[Klaus] And research.

19:17.000 --> 19:17.916
[Violet] And cook.

19:18.583 --> 19:19.416
Right, Sunny?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Sunny!

19:22.541 --> 19:24.541
[thunder crashing]

19:32.000 --> 19:33.625
Sunny! [panting]

19:37.333 --> 19:38.666
A house inside a tree.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.166
Someone's built a water filtration system.

19:42.750 --> 19:43.750
[babbling]

19:44.125 --> 19:45.666
[Klaus] Someone's been reading a book.

19:45.958 --> 19:48.083
"A figure from the shadowy past
has washed ashore.

19:48.166 --> 19:51.000
I convinced the others to lock him
in a cage before he could recognize me.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.916
Note to self:
Why won't anyone call me Ish?"

19:53.375 --> 19:55.000
[Violet]
"The others concern me too.

19:55.083 --> 19:58.083
They may be young, but I've never known
a Baudelaire who didn't rock the boat."

19:58.166 --> 20:00.333
There's an annotation. "See page 252."

20:02.250 --> 20:04.208
-[Violet] It looks like...
-[Klaus] It can't be.

20:04.291 --> 20:05.416
[Ishmael] Yes, Baudelaires.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.625
[thunder crashing]

20:09.125 --> 20:11.250
That's your mother's handwriting.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.541
Why is our mother's handwriting
in that book?

20:13.625 --> 20:14.875
Because, Baudelaires,

20:15.375 --> 20:18.083
your parents lived on this island.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.041
Our parents lived here? Did you know them?

20:20.125 --> 20:21.250
[Klaus] Who are you really?

20:21.333 --> 20:23.041
That's an interesting question.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.791
I used to be a school principal.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.333
Yes, that was many years ago,

20:29.416 --> 20:32.333
at a school called Prufrock Prep.

20:34.833 --> 20:38.500
[music drones]

20:44.083 --> 20:47.375
Like most schools,
it was an underfunded institution.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.458
But every year, there were a few children

20:50.541 --> 20:52.958
with the same gleam in their eyes
that you have.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.875
The Snickets. The Quagmires.

20:54.958 --> 20:56.875
Count Olaf. Your parents.

20:57.708 --> 20:59.583
And when I met a child like that,

21:00.208 --> 21:03.333
I would recruit them
into a secret organization.

21:03.416 --> 21:04.666
My organization.

21:04.750 --> 21:05.875
You started V.F.D.

21:05.958 --> 21:09.041
When a fire breaks out, the Official
Fire Department is there to fight it,

21:09.125 --> 21:11.833
but figurative fires need fighting, too.

21:11.916 --> 21:14.250
And my students were interested
in so many things.

21:14.333 --> 21:17.250
Literature, science, music, theater,

21:17.333 --> 21:19.583
animal behavior, the culinary arts.

21:19.916 --> 21:25.375
And I thought, what if a group of curious,
capable young people came together

21:25.458 --> 21:29.750
to stand against the ignorance
and injustice of this world?

21:30.083 --> 21:32.458
We could make it a quieter, safer place.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.291
[sighs]

21:34.375 --> 21:36.916
And for a time we did, and then, well...

21:37.708 --> 21:39.041
It all went up in smoke.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.333
-The schism.
-Yes.

21:40.416 --> 21:43.791
You can try to push back
against the troubles of this world,

21:43.875 --> 21:45.875
but trouble is like the tide,

21:46.250 --> 21:47.916
and it always returns.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.375
When the schism broke out,

21:49.458 --> 21:53.791
I abandoned my creation,
and I sailed here to live in exile.

21:53.875 --> 21:56.291
Later on, your parents sailed here, too.

21:56.375 --> 21:59.166
They wanted to start a family
someplace safe.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.583
They built this house,

22:00.666 --> 22:03.500
they wrote in that book,
they cooked delicious meals, and...

22:04.833 --> 22:08.125
they built the most incredible inventions.

22:09.666 --> 22:11.250
And then one day...

22:13.041 --> 22:14.208
they left.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.875
I tried to warn them.

22:15.958 --> 22:19.208
I told them terrible things
waited out there in the world.

22:20.166 --> 22:23.750
When  The Daily Punctilio  washed up
and I read about the fire,

22:24.708 --> 22:27.916
I knew those terrible things
had come to pass.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.083
[thunder rumbles]

22:30.666 --> 22:32.000
[clock chimes]

22:32.083 --> 22:35.083
It's almost Decision Day,
and you have a decision to make.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.500
I failed your parents.

22:37.583 --> 22:40.750
I could not protect them,
but I  can  protect their children.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.458
Drink the cordial.

22:45.666 --> 22:46.958
[thunder crashes]

22:49.208 --> 22:50.500
And think about it.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.083
What are you thinking?

22:57.708 --> 23:01.041
[Klaus] That I wish we had our parents
here and not just their handwriting.

23:01.416 --> 23:03.458
[thunder crashes]

23:04.625 --> 23:06.875
[Lemony] The difference
between your memory of a person

23:06.958 --> 23:10.083
and their handwriting is that,
unlike words written in ink,

23:10.166 --> 23:12.166
most memories fade over time.

23:13.458 --> 23:16.916
You likely no longer remember what
it was like to be a small, gurgling baby,

23:17.000 --> 23:18.416
just as I no longer remember

23:18.500 --> 23:21.166
what it was like to travel by trolley
in the light of day,

23:21.250 --> 23:24.625
instead of by secret tunnel
in the dead of night.

23:27.666 --> 23:29.458
But some memories never fade,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.958
and these memories
are often of people we've lost.

23:34.208 --> 23:35.208
We carry them with us,

23:35.291 --> 23:38.291
the way I carry every letter
I ever received from Beatrice...

23:39.291 --> 23:43.500
a woman I will never share a root beer
float or a horse costume with again.

23:49.000 --> 23:49.916
Hello?

23:53.375 --> 23:54.750
Is anyone down here?

23:58.041 --> 24:01.041
[sheep bleating]

24:04.916 --> 24:06.958
[Ishmael] Attention, colonists!

24:07.041 --> 24:09.583
Another Decision Day has arrived.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.541
Anyone wishing to leave the island?

24:15.708 --> 24:16.750
Wise decision.

24:17.416 --> 24:19.333
I declare Decision Day is over!

24:19.416 --> 24:21.833
-Decision Day isn't over yet.
-Because we've decided to leave.

24:22.250 --> 24:25.500
Baudelaires, you seem agitated.
Why don't you have some cordial?

24:25.583 --> 24:27.708
We won't drink any,
and neither should any of you!

24:27.791 --> 24:29.791
We read about fermented beverages here.
They're an opiate!

24:29.875 --> 24:33.166
-Nothing wrong with a little opiate!
-Ishmael's trying to control you!

24:33.250 --> 24:35.625
That's why nobody remembers
your lives before the island,

24:35.708 --> 24:37.250
and why nobody ever wants to leave!

24:37.333 --> 24:39.708
The Baudelaires are confused. [chuckles]

24:39.791 --> 24:41.583
Obviously dehydrated.

24:41.666 --> 24:44.125
I suggest you drink some cordial.

24:44.541 --> 24:47.750
I suggest it very strongly.

24:48.916 --> 24:49.750
[Friday] Castaway!

24:49.833 --> 24:50.750
Castaway!

24:52.375 --> 24:54.041
[Ishmael] She appears to be hurt...

24:54.708 --> 24:56.208
and very pregnant.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.083
-Kit!
- Kit!

25:03.166 --> 25:04.000
[woman] Yes?

25:05.875 --> 25:07.125
-[Violet] No.
-Yes.

25:07.541 --> 25:10.166
[high-pitched] It is I, Kit Snicket.

25:10.458 --> 25:13.958
And as you can see, I'm very pregnant.

25:14.041 --> 25:16.583
No, you're not. You're Count Olaf!
A child can see that.

25:17.458 --> 25:18.583
I'm a castaway

25:18.666 --> 25:21.083
-and should be welcomed with gifts.
-[Alonso] You're not!

25:21.166 --> 25:23.375
You're that villain we put in a birdcage.

25:23.458 --> 25:26.750
[whimpering]
I need medicine and your finest wine.

25:26.833 --> 25:29.916
-[Klaus] It  is  Kit!
-[Olaf] Pay no attention to that woman!

25:45.041 --> 25:45.875
[Violet] Kit!

25:46.375 --> 25:47.458
Kit! Kit!

25:49.333 --> 25:50.166
She's breathing.

25:50.250 --> 25:52.083
-[Klaus] What happened?
-[Violet] I don't know.

25:52.166 --> 25:54.458
I'll wrap the ankle.
You handle Count Olaf.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.666
I've never seen so many books.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.125
I've never seen books at all.

25:59.208 --> 26:02.125
That treacherous woman up there has
dragged these books up to your colony

26:02.208 --> 26:05.041
just to bring trouble
to you poor island folk.

26:05.125 --> 26:06.875
We're not falling for that!

26:08.541 --> 26:10.666
-Ishmael.
-Now look here...

26:11.166 --> 26:15.000
As a decent person,
I never presume someone's gender,

26:15.083 --> 26:17.833
but you're trying to manipulate
my decency,

26:17.916 --> 26:21.625
so take off that ridiculous disguise!

26:22.250 --> 26:24.791
You first, Ish.

26:28.291 --> 26:30.375
You're still rotten, Olaf.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.875
It's time you took responsibility
for your actions.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.166
Only if you take responsibility for yours.

26:35.250 --> 26:37.000
You took a plucky schoolboy

26:37.083 --> 26:40.541
and made him think that books and poetry
and learning would keep him safe.

26:41.041 --> 26:42.958
Well, they didn't.

26:43.041 --> 26:48.000
Every parent figure I've ever had
has either let me down or died.

26:48.583 --> 26:51.000
This is the end.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.333
Only for you.

26:52.416 --> 26:54.625
I don't know
how you got out of that cage--

26:54.708 --> 26:57.500
-I picked the lock with a fish bone.
-I'm going to put you right back in.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.875
I don't think that you are. [chuckles]
You were right, Ish.

27:00.958 --> 27:04.333
One harpoon isn't much of a threat
against a colony,

27:04.416 --> 27:10.250
but how about a diving helmet
filled with the world's deadliest fungus?

27:11.083 --> 27:12.416
You don't mean--

27:12.500 --> 27:13.708
[Olaf] That's right!

27:13.791 --> 27:15.916
I found the Medusoid Mycelium,

27:16.291 --> 27:18.541
and I will unleash it on this island

27:18.625 --> 27:22.875
unless you give me those three orphans
and that canoe.

27:23.250 --> 27:26.083
The orphans may be mutinous,
but they're still under my protection.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.041
I won't let you take them.

27:28.125 --> 27:30.833
[scoffs] And how do you plan to stop me?

27:30.916 --> 27:31.916
With this.

27:34.541 --> 27:35.750
Sunny?

27:35.833 --> 27:36.666
Kit!

27:36.750 --> 27:38.166
-Violet.
-You washed up on an island.

27:38.250 --> 27:41.041
-You're gonna be all right.
-I'm afraid we're all far from all right.

27:41.125 --> 27:44.333
I saw a diving helmet full of a dangerous
fungus wash up. Do you see it?

27:46.833 --> 27:49.416
I think I know where it is.
Sunny, stay with Kit!

27:54.083 --> 27:55.875
-No!
-Don't shoot!

27:56.208 --> 27:57.208
[glass shattering]

27:57.291 --> 27:59.208
[gasping]

28:03.291 --> 28:04.708
You harpooned me.

28:05.041 --> 28:06.208
Well, you started it!

28:06.750 --> 28:08.916
You literally started it!

28:09.000 --> 28:12.666
It doesn't matter who started it!
Those spores are the Medusoid Mycelium!

28:12.750 --> 28:14.291
Medusoid Mycelium?

28:14.375 --> 28:15.375
[cackles]

28:15.458 --> 28:17.083
I feel something weird in my throat.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.541
[Olaf] Yes. That weird feeling

28:19.625 --> 28:23.750
is a poisonous mushroom that is
infecting you with its deadly spores.

28:23.833 --> 28:26.041
-It's deadly?
-We need horseradish!

28:26.125 --> 28:28.000
-It's the only cure!
-[Klaus] Or wasabi.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.916
There aren't any spices on the island!

28:30.000 --> 28:34.500
This is my moment of ultimate triumph!
[cackling]

28:34.583 --> 28:38.125
At last, I have everything I have ever--

28:38.208 --> 28:39.125
[spluttering]

28:40.166 --> 28:41.416
I have ev--

28:41.500 --> 28:42.958
[coughing]

28:45.125 --> 28:46.291
I don't want to die.

28:46.375 --> 28:48.791
We need horseradish
or another culinary substitute!

28:48.875 --> 28:51.041
Wait, I know of a horseradish factory
off Lousy Lane.

28:51.125 --> 28:53.166
We can sail the outrigger there
and be saved!

28:53.250 --> 28:54.750
You'd never reach it in time!

28:54.833 --> 28:55.916
To the outrigger!

28:58.541 --> 29:01.375
[moaning]

29:04.333 --> 29:05.791
[Ishmael] Push off, everyone!

29:05.875 --> 29:08.000
-What if you don't make it?
-You could spread the fungus

29:08.083 --> 29:10.333
-to the entire world!
-You're making a terrible mistake!

29:10.416 --> 29:11.875
Maybe I am.

29:11.958 --> 29:15.708
Being a leader is like being a parent.
You try to keep your children safe.

29:15.791 --> 29:18.333
You just don't always know
what you're doing.

29:18.791 --> 29:19.916
Farewell, Baudelaires!

29:20.833 --> 29:21.708
Farewell!

29:30.666 --> 29:33.250
-[Klaus] They'll never make it.
-There has to be something we can do.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.375
There's always one thing you can do.

29:35.458 --> 29:37.666
[wheezing]

29:38.041 --> 29:39.666
You can die.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.750
[coughing]

29:43.083 --> 29:45.500
Don't you understand, Baudelaires?

29:46.708 --> 29:49.250
Don't you understand that so much of life

29:49.333 --> 29:52.291
is just waiting for people
who have wounded you

29:52.375 --> 29:56.333
to finally, finally die?

29:56.416 --> 29:57.833
[chuckling]

29:57.916 --> 29:58.750
[wheezing]

29:58.833 --> 30:00.208
[Kit moaning]

30:00.291 --> 30:01.375
Kit!

30:01.458 --> 30:04.375
[Kit crying, Olaf coughing]

30:09.375 --> 30:10.416
Baudelaires.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.291
We failed to stop Count Olaf
from releasing the Medusoid Mycelium.

30:13.375 --> 30:15.125
We haven't failed yet.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.333
Tell me, what happened at the hotel?

30:17.791 --> 30:20.333
-Do you have the sugar bowl?
-We failed there, too.

30:20.416 --> 30:22.416
[waves crashing]

30:24.875 --> 30:27.750
You said the sugar bowl could help us.
What's in the sugar bowl?

30:32.083 --> 30:32.958
Sugar.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.083
Sugar?

30:35.166 --> 30:39.250
From a botanical hybrid V.F.D. developed
to defend us against the Mycelium.

30:39.333 --> 30:42.083
-I thought that was horseradish.
-Horseradish cures you.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.166
The hybrid immunizes you.

30:44.583 --> 30:46.125
Baudelaires, I failed you.

30:46.208 --> 30:49.500
I told you I would come back to the hotel,
but then I saw an SOS signal

30:49.583 --> 30:51.291
from a self-sustaining
hot-air mobile home.

30:51.375 --> 30:52.458
Duncan and Isadora.

30:52.541 --> 30:54.375
-Do you know where they are?
-Are they safe?

30:54.458 --> 30:55.458
I don't know.

30:55.541 --> 30:58.208
My submarine got attacked
before I could reach them. I'm...

30:58.833 --> 31:00.000
I'm so sorry.

31:02.375 --> 31:03.708
We're sorry, too.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.208
We helped Count Olaf
burn down the hotel.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.208
Sometimes...

31:08.625 --> 31:10.291
you have to fight fire with fire.

31:10.666 --> 31:12.916
When you fight fire with fire,
the world goes up in smoke.

31:13.791 --> 31:14.875
Dewey says that.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.083
Tell me, Baudelaires.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.458
Is he safe?

31:22.708 --> 31:23.708
Dewey's dead.

31:29.416 --> 31:31.666
My baby will never meet her father.

31:38.708 --> 31:40.625
I can feel the fungus in my throat.

31:41.708 --> 31:44.333
The hour's not over yet.
Klaus, stay with Kit.

31:44.416 --> 31:46.000
No. Baudelaires...

31:47.041 --> 31:47.916
stay together.

31:48.875 --> 31:50.750
[panting]

31:50.833 --> 31:52.250
Hold on. We'll be back soon.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.541
Violet, I don't feel too good.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.583
We're almost there.
Let's hope our parents cooked with spices.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.791
[slithering rasp]

32:05.000 --> 32:08.041
[Violet] We have to find horseradish,
or another culinary substitute.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.125
Do you see anything?

32:15.208 --> 32:17.208
There's nothing here!
No horseradish. No wasabi.

32:18.333 --> 32:21.208
This can't be the end, not when
we're so close to so many things.

32:21.291 --> 32:24.208
-[Klaus] I wish our parents could help us.
-Maybe they still can.

32:24.291 --> 32:26.625
If there was another antidote,
maybe they wrote it down.

32:26.708 --> 32:27.916
[Klaus] There's no index.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.958
[coughing] There's no table of contents.

32:30.625 --> 32:32.500
We don't have time to read an entire book.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.958
Is there another way to search a book
without reading it?

32:35.041 --> 32:36.666
[stammering] We can skim it.

32:37.166 --> 32:40.166
[Lemony]  Skimming a book
is not the same as reading it,

32:40.250 --> 32:43.875
for the same reason that fast-forwarding
through a piece of televised entertainment

32:43.958 --> 32:45.833
is not the same as watching it.

32:45.916 --> 32:49.541
But when you skim through a narrative,
you get a strange view of the story,

32:49.625 --> 32:51.833
full of confusing utterances...

32:51.916 --> 32:53.458
It's a good thing I am not a centipede!

32:53.541 --> 32:55.291
...out of context revelations...

32:55.375 --> 32:57.458
"At that time, Mr. Poe
was known by his stage name..."

32:57.541 --> 32:59.041
...and increasing desperation

32:59.125 --> 33:00.875
as you get closer to the end.

33:00.958 --> 33:03.250
Sunny's shivering,
and I'm finding it hard to breathe.

33:03.333 --> 33:04.166
[Lemony]  Sadly...

33:05.250 --> 33:07.041
my search remains fruitless.

33:07.125 --> 33:09.791
-Wait!
- But sometimes when you skim,

33:10.333 --> 33:12.208
you find what you're looking for.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.708
It's Mother's handwriting.

33:13.791 --> 33:16.708
"In case the treachery
of the outside world reaches our shores,

33:16.791 --> 33:19.708
we've recreated the botanical hybrid
in the tuberous canopy."

33:19.791 --> 33:22.166
Botanical hybrid. That's what Kit said
was in the sugar bowl.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.875
I don't know
what "tuberous canopy" means.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.750
We found the answer,
but I don't know the words.

33:28.500 --> 33:29.666
Sunny, what did you say?

33:29.750 --> 33:30.750
She said apple.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.250
Tuberous canopy. The roots above!

33:33.333 --> 33:34.541
The apples from the tree.

33:34.625 --> 33:36.375
The cure is right above our heads!

33:39.750 --> 33:42.500
[coughing, panting]

33:42.875 --> 33:43.916
We can't die in here.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.333
Our parents gave us the answers
in this room without even knowing it.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.041
-Maybe it's too late.
-[coughing]

33:50.416 --> 33:52.458
Maybe this is the end of our story.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.333
[rasping]

34:04.541 --> 34:06.041
[coughing]

34:09.375 --> 34:11.375
[hissing]

34:15.291 --> 34:17.416
I must be hallucinating
from the mushrooms.

34:22.083 --> 34:24.583
That looks like
the Incredibly Deadly Viper. [coughs]

34:25.375 --> 34:28.375
[hissing]

34:39.083 --> 34:40.458
[panting]

34:53.791 --> 34:54.791
It's bitter.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.541
And they say the first bite of an apple
tastes the best.

34:58.458 --> 34:59.916
It's the best thing I've ever tasted.

35:17.375 --> 35:20.166
You're gonna be okay.
We found a way to dilute the poison.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.250
-Take a bite.
-No, I can't.

35:22.333 --> 35:23.500
You have to. You're sick.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.708
No, I can't. It would harm the baby.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.208
I can feel her coming soon.

35:28.291 --> 35:31.250
[Violet] The water's rising.
If you don't get off, you'll float away!

35:31.333 --> 35:32.416
I can't move.

35:33.458 --> 35:35.541
I'm not as strong as you, Baudelaires.
I've...

35:36.500 --> 35:38.125
lost too many people.

35:38.208 --> 35:39.333
My parents.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.250
My brothers.

35:42.375 --> 35:43.333
Dewey.

35:43.416 --> 35:44.791
Your baby needs you.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.666
[coughing]

35:47.333 --> 35:48.458
We have to get her to shore.

35:48.541 --> 35:49.791
We're too weak from the poison.

35:49.875 --> 35:51.375
[coughing]

35:52.791 --> 35:53.916
He'd never help us.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.333
What choice do we have?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.041
We're gonna get you help.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.750
[groaning]

36:02.541 --> 36:05.708
At last,
you bow before the king of Olaf-Land.

36:05.791 --> 36:08.041
We don't have time for your nonsense.
We need your help.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.416
You need  my  help?   [wheezing]

36:10.500 --> 36:12.458
Well, well, well. [chuckling]

36:12.541 --> 36:14.416
How do you like them apples?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.875
Take a bite of this apple.
It'll dilute the poison.

36:16.958 --> 36:18.833
I don't want your bitter fruit!

36:18.916 --> 36:21.750
I've lost too much to go on. [wheezing]

36:21.833 --> 36:25.250
My parents, my true love, my henchfolk,

36:25.333 --> 36:27.875
an enormous fortune I never really earned.

36:27.958 --> 36:29.375
You have to go on.

36:29.458 --> 36:31.625
Do one good thing in your life, Olaf.

36:31.708 --> 36:35.083
I've done lots of good things in my life.
[wheezing]

36:35.541 --> 36:37.416
I once took in three orphans.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.375
You made us orphans in the first place!

36:39.458 --> 36:41.041
Is that what you think?

36:41.125 --> 36:43.250
-We know it.
-You don't know anything.

36:43.791 --> 36:45.541
[Kit moaning]

36:45.625 --> 36:46.583
[Violet] Please!

36:46.666 --> 36:48.166
You have to help Kit.

36:48.250 --> 36:50.250
Her baby is arriving. She could die!

36:52.041 --> 36:53.333
Kit...

36:53.416 --> 36:54.416
might die?

36:58.750 --> 36:59.666
Give me that.

37:09.125 --> 37:10.166
[groaning]

37:13.250 --> 37:14.375
That looks bad.

37:15.541 --> 37:16.958
I've been worse.

37:27.083 --> 37:29.500
Hello, hello, hello.

37:52.958 --> 37:54.666
[straining]

38:14.125 --> 38:15.000
You!

38:15.083 --> 38:17.166
I told you I'd do that one last time.

38:17.916 --> 38:19.625
You are a wicked man.

38:20.083 --> 38:24.250
You really think one kind act will make me
forgive you all your failings?

38:25.250 --> 38:26.916
I haven't apologized.

38:27.875 --> 38:30.750
[sighs, splutters]

38:32.708 --> 38:33.875
[sighs]

38:35.875 --> 38:37.166
-Let me see your eyes.
-Hm?

38:41.208 --> 38:44.875
The night has a thousand eyes,
and the day but one.

38:46.500 --> 38:47.541
Yet the light...

38:48.166 --> 38:51.916
of the bright world dies
with the dying sun.

38:53.833 --> 38:57.250
The mind has a thousand eyes,
and the heart but one.

38:57.958 --> 39:01.208
Yet the light of a whole life dies
when love is done.

39:04.333 --> 39:05.958
I never forgot you.

39:07.916 --> 39:09.125
You hurt people.

39:09.208 --> 39:10.083
Yeah.

39:10.666 --> 39:12.208
And people hurt me.

39:14.833 --> 39:16.208
[groaning]

39:16.291 --> 39:18.166
It's all over now.

39:19.083 --> 39:19.958
[coughing]

39:20.041 --> 39:22.416
What's that thing
your brother used to say?

39:23.791 --> 39:26.958
Man hands on misery to man.

39:28.291 --> 39:29.125
It deepens...

39:29.541 --> 39:30.916
[both] like a coastal shelf.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.041
[chuckling]

39:34.250 --> 39:37.583
Get out as early as you can--

39:37.666 --> 39:40.500
[coughing]

39:45.708 --> 39:49.000
And don't have any kids yourself.

40:09.333 --> 40:10.416
He's gone, Sunny.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.416
He's dead.

40:29.708 --> 40:31.708
[moaning]

40:43.416 --> 40:46.250
[Lemony]  As I'm sure you know,
"labor" is the term for the process

40:46.333 --> 40:47.708
by which a woman gives birth.

40:47.791 --> 40:52.416
By no coincidence, it is also a word
that means "a very difficult task."

40:52.875 --> 40:54.583
[baby crying]

40:55.625 --> 40:56.708
[Violet] It's a girl.

41:05.333 --> 41:06.666
What will you name her?

41:07.458 --> 41:09.291
Let's name her after your mother.

41:11.875 --> 41:14.541
I always hoped I'd be
as good a mother as she was.

41:14.625 --> 41:16.916
-You will be.
-[gasping]

41:18.208 --> 41:20.541
[gasping] It's too late.

41:21.208 --> 41:22.750
The apple isn't working.

41:24.041 --> 41:26.250
My baby will be an orphan.

41:26.833 --> 41:27.958
[baby gurgling]

41:28.041 --> 41:29.666
Just promise me, Baudelaires...

41:36.250 --> 41:39.375
Promise me she won't be alone.

41:44.666 --> 41:45.666
Hey.

41:46.916 --> 41:48.250
-[baby gurgling]
-I know.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.458
[coughing]

41:51.541 --> 41:54.708
-Kit! Kit!
-[wheezing, coughing]

41:54.791 --> 41:56.458
[Violet] Stay with us!

41:56.541 --> 41:57.958
-[coughing]
-Kit!

41:58.666 --> 41:59.750
Please don't go!

42:00.291 --> 42:01.166
Kit!

42:01.250 --> 42:02.583
Please don't leave us!

42:12.958 --> 42:15.916
[Lemony]  It is likely your eyes
were closed when you were born,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.791
so that when you left the safe place
of your mother's womb,

42:18.875 --> 42:21.833
or if you are a seahorse,
your father's yolk sac,

42:22.416 --> 42:27.125
you did not yet know the people who
would shelter you as your life began,

42:27.833 --> 42:32.000
when you were even smaller and more
delicate and demanding than you are now.

42:32.916 --> 42:34.625
Perhaps if we saw what was ahead,

42:34.708 --> 42:38.208
and glimpsed the crimes, follies,
and misfortunes that would befall us,

42:38.291 --> 42:40.416
we would all stay in our mothers' wombs,

42:41.166 --> 42:42.750
then there would be nobody in the world

42:42.833 --> 42:45.708
but a great number
of pregnant, irritated women.

42:47.958 --> 42:52.333
In any case, all of our stories
begin in darkness with our eyes closed.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.250
And all our stories end that way, too,

42:57.833 --> 42:59.875
as we utter our last words...

43:00.958 --> 43:03.083
before slipping back into darkness...

43:04.000 --> 43:05.041
and silence.

43:09.416 --> 43:10.250
Violet...

43:12.250 --> 43:13.416
What do we do?

43:13.500 --> 43:15.833
-We look after her.
- How?

43:15.916 --> 43:18.833
"A library's like an island
in a vast sea of ignorance..."

43:19.208 --> 43:20.875
"Particularly if the library is tall

43:20.958 --> 43:22.958
and the surrounding area
has been flooded."

43:24.208 --> 43:25.541
Our parents left us this book.

43:27.083 --> 43:28.833
[Violet] We can start at the beginning.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.416
Page one.

43:36.875 --> 43:38.375
"We're embarking on a new voyage,

43:38.458 --> 43:41.458
and Bertrand insisted
we document it in this book."

43:41.541 --> 43:44.500
"We know that no book can contain
every story in the world,

43:44.583 --> 43:48.166
even if the book is long and the world
seems to grow smaller every day."

43:49.208 --> 43:50.541
"But perhaps many years from now,

43:50.625 --> 43:53.125
another set of voyagers
will discover this book

43:53.208 --> 43:55.291
and read about the people
who came before them..."

43:55.708 --> 43:57.541
"The stories they left behind..."

43:57.916 --> 44:00.416
"And this entire series
of unfortunate events."

44:02.916 --> 44:04.375
[typewriter keys clattering]

44:05.416 --> 44:06.750
[woman]  Last chapter.

44:06.833 --> 44:07.875
[bell dings]

44:21.875 --> 44:22.916
[bell dings]

44:26.833 --> 44:30.250
[woman]  Today the seawall will flood,
and we've reached our decision.

44:32.125 --> 44:35.791
We will leave the island in a boat
Bertrand has built and named after me,

44:36.291 --> 44:37.458
to rejoin the world...

44:38.416 --> 44:40.625
in time for our first child to be born.

44:42.041 --> 44:44.291
We came here to raise children
someplace safe,

44:44.875 --> 44:47.250
but we now realize
we cannot shelter them forever.

44:54.166 --> 44:56.500
If it is a girl, we will name her Violet.

44:57.916 --> 44:59.375
And if it is a boy...

45:00.125 --> 45:01.125
Lemony!

45:01.208 --> 45:02.041
Lemony?

45:02.125 --> 45:05.041
-They were gonna name me Lemony.
-I wonder why that name was so important.

45:05.125 --> 45:06.333
We met a Lemony, remember?

45:06.416 --> 45:08.083
Our parents never told us about him.

45:08.166 --> 45:10.833
Our parents never told us a lot of things.

45:10.916 --> 45:11.791
Cake!

45:17.583 --> 45:18.750
[laughing]

45:22.250 --> 45:23.083
Ready?

45:23.166 --> 45:25.416
One, two, three...

45:28.041 --> 45:30.416
[all] Happy birthday!

45:30.500 --> 45:31.875
I can't believe it's been a year.

45:31.958 --> 45:34.250
It's a strange place to celebrate
your first birthday.

45:34.333 --> 45:36.166
Should we tell her
about the one on a submarine?

45:36.250 --> 45:37.958
Or the one you had in a jail cell?

45:38.041 --> 45:40.041
[laughing]

45:49.708 --> 45:51.291
[gurgling]

45:53.750 --> 45:56.333
It's been a year. That means the seawall
will flood again tomorrow.

45:56.416 --> 45:57.541
This is our chance to leave.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
And go where?

45:59.083 --> 46:01.625
We can't shelter her forever.
Her parents knew that.

46:02.833 --> 46:04.250
If we leave, what will we find?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.708
[Lemony]  The world is a complicated
and confusing place,

46:09.833 --> 46:10.875
with more stories

46:10.958 --> 46:15.041
than even one very dedicated,
very lonely researcher can uncover.

46:22.750 --> 46:24.500
Stories about noble siblings

46:24.583 --> 46:28.291
who survive fire and eagles
to be reunited at last.

46:31.625 --> 46:33.416
Or two submarine co-captains

46:33.500 --> 46:35.750
on a mission to find
their missing stepfather.

46:36.041 --> 46:39.875
[over PA]  Aye! This is Captain
Widdershins! Is anyone out there?

46:41.791 --> 46:45.125
[applause, cheering]

46:45.208 --> 46:49.083
Or a troupe of actors
finding personal and artistic fulfillment.

46:52.583 --> 46:53.791
At least for a night.

46:54.791 --> 46:56.333
I've even heard of a brave snake

46:56.416 --> 47:00.083
who swam a great distance
to carry an apple to a certain outrigger.

47:00.750 --> 47:03.833
Though, of course,
there are still unknowns.

47:07.666 --> 47:09.833
[panting]

47:10.333 --> 47:12.375
Well, we can't set sail
on a boat named the  Olaf.

47:12.458 --> 47:14.708
I think the original name is underneath.

47:22.833 --> 47:24.708
[baby gurgling]

47:25.708 --> 47:27.625
That's right. That's your name.

47:27.708 --> 47:28.958
It was our mother's name, too.

47:29.041 --> 47:30.041
[baby squealing]

47:31.000 --> 47:32.208
Are we ready to do this?

47:32.875 --> 47:36.000
If we wait until we're ready,
we'll be waiting the rest of our lives.

47:38.500 --> 47:39.541
Come on, Beatrice.

47:47.208 --> 47:48.333
[Klaus] It's okay, it's okay.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.083
[Beatrice laughing]

47:52.166 --> 47:53.125
Let's go home.

48:04.833 --> 48:06.833
[Lemony]  Sometimes a chapter might end,

48:06.916 --> 48:09.708
but that doesn't mean
that the story is over.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.375
And some stories go on,

48:12.458 --> 48:15.416
even after the storyteller
has stopped telling them.

48:21.291 --> 48:24.541
Strange as it may seem,
I still hope for the best,

48:24.625 --> 48:28.083
even though the best,
like an interesting piece of mail,

48:28.166 --> 48:30.041
so rarely arrives.

48:35.416 --> 48:39.375
Then again, the 14th time
you are followed to your motel room,

48:39.458 --> 48:41.750
it might not be the police or...

48:42.375 --> 48:44.666
any surviving enemies. It...

48:51.000 --> 48:52.416
might be a relative...

48:53.041 --> 48:53.958
with...

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
an invitation to share a story.

48:59.916 --> 49:01.083
And a root beer float.

49:05.958 --> 49:06.916
[ringing]

49:10.541 --> 49:11.375
Mr. Snicket?

49:14.208 --> 49:15.208
I'm your niece.

49:15.833 --> 49:16.958
Beatrice Baudelaire.

49:17.583 --> 49:18.583
The second.

49:25.833 --> 49:27.958
Would you like to hear a story
about our family?

49:32.416 --> 49:33.875
I would like that very much.

49:34.958 --> 49:38.208
As you know, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny
Baudelaire were intelligent children...

49:38.291 --> 49:40.625
And they were charming
and resourceful and had...

49:40.708 --> 49:42.791
[together] Pleasant facial features.

49:42.875 --> 49:45.708
They lived with their parents in a mansion
in the heart of a busy city.

49:45.791 --> 49:46.916
You know this story.

49:48.458 --> 49:49.375
Parts.

49:51.166 --> 49:53.208
Do you know the part about the pirates?

49:53.291 --> 49:54.125
Pirates?

49:54.208 --> 49:55.458
Female Finnish pirates.

49:55.541 --> 49:57.458
It was after we sailed away
from the island,

49:57.541 --> 49:59.541
but before their third trip
to Briny Beach.

49:59.625 --> 50:02.416
Violet had just tied up her hair
to invent a steering mechanism,

50:02.500 --> 50:04.250
and Klaus was studying tidal charts,

50:04.333 --> 50:07.208
