* Men... *

00:03.208 --> 00:04.842
I'm gonna hate this movie.

00:04.843 --> 00:06.410
How can you be so sure?

00:06.411 --> 00:08.997
It's got subtitles.

00:08.998 --> 00:11.105
The only good subtitles
are for Nazis,

00:11.106 --> 00:14.207
Colombian drug lords,
and space aliens.

00:14.208 --> 00:16.207
<i>Oh, and Kung Fu.</i>

00:16.209 --> 00:19.112
Excuse me, but NPR called
Hiroshima la Poubelle

00:19.113 --> 00:21.190
an "enchanting journey
of self-discovery."

00:21.191 --> 00:23.027
Well, they're not gonna call it

00:23.028 --> 00:27.243
a "two-hour French snooze-fest
for pompous douche-buckets"

00:27.244 --> 00:28.978
Hey, you agreed that if
I paid for the tickets,

00:28.979 --> 00:30.316
we could see what I want to see.

00:30.317 --> 00:32.222
That's because I
didn't actually think

00:32.223 --> 00:33.659
you could scrape together 18 bucks

00:33.660 --> 00:35.297
without stopping didn't
aat a blood bank.

00:35.298 --> 00:37.099
Well, it is a small price to pay

00:37.100 --> 00:38.601
to finally get you
out of the house.

00:38.602 --> 00:40.336
It's been three weeks since
you and Chelsea broke up,

00:40.337 --> 00:41.404
and you need to move on.

00:41.405 --> 00:43.007
Says the guy who
still carries around

00:43.008 --> 00:44.475
a naked picture of his ex-wife.

00:44.476 --> 00:45.743
Hey, I bought those boobs.

00:45.744 --> 00:48.011
I have a right to look
at them once in a while.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.117
Damn. I don't believe.

00:54.118 --> 00:54.985
What?

00:54.986 --> 00:55.852
She's here.

00:55.853 --> 00:57.353
My ex-wife?

00:57.354 --> 00:59.890
No! It's Chelsea.

00:59.891 --> 01:01.493
She's with that Brad guy.

01:01.494 --> 01:02.863
So wh-what do we do?

01:02.864 --> 01:03.964
Do we say hello?

01:03.965 --> 01:05.935
No. We get the hell out of here.

01:05.936 --> 01:07.369
Charlie?

01:07.370 --> 01:08.904
Hey.

01:08.905 --> 01:09.938
Look who's here.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.174
Alan, Chelsea's here.

01:11.175 --> 01:12.777
Oh, hey, Chelsea.

01:12.778 --> 01:13.845
Hi, Alan.

01:13.846 --> 01:15.180
You guys remember Brad.

01:15.181 --> 01:16.448
How's it going?

01:16.449 --> 01:17.718
Good. Great.

01:17.719 --> 01:19.553
Looking forward to the movie.

01:19.554 --> 01:20.888
I'm surprised to see you here.

01:20.889 --> 01:22.990
This doesn't strike
me as your cup of tea.

01:22.991 --> 01:25.160
Are you kidding? NPR called it

01:25.161 --> 01:27.362
an "enchanting journey
of self-discovery"

01:27.363 --> 01:29.731
You know I live for that crap.

01:29.732 --> 01:31.133
Right.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.569
Okay, well, it was good seeing you.

01:33.570 --> 01:35.604
You, too.

01:37.207 --> 01:38.941
Wow.

01:38.942 --> 01:41.310
That was awkward.

01:41.311 --> 01:43.212
Tell me about it.

01:43.213 --> 01:45.015
Had to be tough for you.

01:45.016 --> 01:46.884
Your ex-fianceÃƒfÃ‚Â©
out with another guy?

01:46.885 --> 01:47.953
Uh-huh.

01:47.954 --> 01:49.522
Good-looking guy.

01:49.523 --> 01:50.556
Yeah.

01:50.557 --> 01:52.827
You're here with your brother.

01:52.828 --> 01:54.062
I know.

01:54.063 --> 01:56.632
That'll tighten the old sphincter.

01:58.101 --> 01:59.902
Oh, God.

01:59.903 --> 02:01.605
You still want to go?

02:01.606 --> 02:04.175
No. No, I'm not gonna
give her the satisfaction.

02:04.176 --> 02:06.612
I can suck it up for two hours.

02:06.613 --> 02:08.714
Three hours and 20 minutes.

02:08.715 --> 02:10.049
What?

02:10.050 --> 02:14.121
It covers four generations of
transsexual Kabuki dancers.

02:16.926 --> 02:18.727
Let's go.

02:20.564 --> 02:22.198
All right, but I think

02:22.199 --> 02:24.735
you should pay me
back for the tickets.

02:24.736 --> 02:26.337
Well, not now.

02:27.172 --> 02:29.374
When it's convenient.

* Men... *

03:01.002 --> 03:03.437
I can't believe she's
already dating.

03:03.438 --> 03:05.105
You're kidding, right?

03:05.106 --> 03:06.740
The day after she moved out,

03:06.741 --> 03:09.209
you ran off to Vegas
and married a stripper.

03:09.210 --> 03:11.344
People grieve in
different ways, Alan.

03:11.345 --> 03:12.412
Mm.

03:12.413 --> 03:14.114
Besides, the stripper
was already married,

03:14.115 --> 03:15.849
so no harm, no foul.

03:15.850 --> 03:19.052
Everybody's got somebody but me.

03:19.053 --> 03:21.154
Hello? I'm not with anyone, either.

03:21.155 --> 03:24.491
Hello? You're a big
loser that says "Hello"

03:28.630 --> 03:31.364
I wonder if she's
slept with him yet.

03:31.365 --> 03:33.467
Oh, don't go there, Charlie.
Don't punish yourself.

03:33.468 --> 03:36.670
Well, if she hasn't already,
I'll bet you she does tonight.

03:36.671 --> 03:38.505
Okay, punish yourself.

03:38.506 --> 03:40.507
I mean, what kind of
man's gonna sit through

03:40.508 --> 03:42.342
a three-hour gay French
flick unless he figures

03:42.343 --> 03:44.411
he's got a good shot at
getting laid afterwards?

03:44.412 --> 03:47.381
You didn't even give
that movie a chance.

03:47.382 --> 03:50.785
I'll bet you right now he's
driving her back to his place.

03:50.786 --> 03:52.153
They're talking about the movie.

03:52.154 --> 03:54.856
He'll make up some crap
about how it made him cry.

03:54.857 --> 03:57.393
Then he'll ask her in
for a cup of coffee,

03:57.394 --> 03:59.429
which he'll turn
into a glass of wine.

03:59.430 --> 04:02.098
One thing leads to another,
and before you know it,

04:02.099 --> 04:05.302
he's got her in the bathtub
running like a jet ski.

04:06.638 --> 04:10.107
At least that's how I'd play it.

04:11.610 --> 04:12.843
Come on.

04:12.844 --> 04:14.111
Where we going?

04:14.112 --> 04:16.880
Chelsea's. I got to see
if she comes home tonight.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.248
Okay. Why am I going?

04:18.249 --> 04:19.714
Hello? I'm hammered.

04:19.716 --> 04:21.983
How's it gonna look if I get a DUI

04:21.985 --> 04:24.153
on the way to spy
on my ex-girljriend?

04:25.689 --> 04:29.292
He's very responsible about
drinking and stalking.

04:31.061 --> 04:33.163
* Men... *

04:34.332 --> 04:37.401
How long are we gonna sit here?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.804
Till she comes home.

04:39.805 --> 04:42.440
What if she spends
all night with Brad?

04:42.441 --> 04:45.310
Well, then we'll be here all night.

04:47.013 --> 04:49.147
No, no. No, don't...

04:50.582 --> 04:53.151
Hey, I can if I want to.

04:53.152 --> 04:54.218
I'm tired.

04:54.219 --> 04:55.320
Then go to sleep.

04:55.321 --> 04:56.855
Without my melatonin
and mouth guard?

04:56.856 --> 04:57.989
I don't think so.

04:59.992 --> 05:01.960
Car, car, car.

05:01.961 --> 05:03.194
Oh, it's them.

05:03.195 --> 05:04.963
It's them. Get down.
Get down. Okay.

05:04.964 --> 05:06.031
Quick, put this on.

05:06.032 --> 05:07.633
What the hell is it? Mustache.

05:07.634 --> 05:09.134
What are you doing with a mustache

05:09.135 --> 05:10.169
in your glove compartment?

05:10.170 --> 05:11.370
Don't worry. It's fake.

05:12.405 --> 05:14.473
That doesn't answer my question.

05:14.474 --> 05:16.175
You think you're the first
guy who's ever checked up

05:16.176 --> 05:17.709
on a woman who's dumped you?
Put it on!

05:17.710 --> 05:20.212
There is a whole side to you

05:20.213 --> 05:22.414
I don't want to
know anything about.

05:22.415 --> 05:25.451
Hey, that's a good look for you.

05:25.452 --> 05:27.219
It's kind of '70s porn star.

05:28.154 --> 05:29.555
I'm guessing.

05:30.924 --> 05:33.059
Look at that thing he's driving.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.595
What? It's a Prius.
Of course it's a Prius.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.130
I'm saving the planet.

05:37.131 --> 05:38.832
Could I play with your boobies?

05:38.833 --> 05:40.767
Hey, do not put down
the green lifestyle.

05:40.768 --> 05:42.068
I have worked very hard

05:42.069 --> 05:44.170
to reduce the size of
my carbon footprint.

05:44.171 --> 05:45.438
You're a mooch and a miser.

05:45.439 --> 05:47.240
Don't try to make it sound hip.

05:48.242 --> 05:51.211
All right, they're
getting out of the car.

05:51.212 --> 05:53.747
Oh, don't you just
love how he dresses?

05:53.748 --> 05:56.283
I mean, youthful,
but not trying too hard.

05:56.284 --> 05:58.585
Unlike some people.

05:59.888 --> 06:02.023
Oh, great. They're kissing.

06:02.024 --> 06:04.292
Good thing he doesn't know
where her mouth has been.

06:08.230 --> 06:09.831
Wait a minute.

06:09.832 --> 06:12.000
He's getting back in his car.

06:12.001 --> 06:13.636
And there he goes.

06:13.637 --> 06:18.108
Well, denied, Mr.
Greenpeace Sissy Pants!

06:18.109 --> 06:19.510
There. You feel better?

06:19.511 --> 06:21.178
Can we please go home now?

06:21.179 --> 06:22.246
Wait, just a minute.

06:22.247 --> 06:23.982
I want to make sure
she gets inside okay.

06:23.983 --> 06:26.885
You know, there's a soft side
to you that I just applaud.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.586
You don't let it out very often,

06:28.587 --> 06:31.122
but when you do,
it just lights up the world.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.526
Wait a minute.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.194
<i>Why is she getting in her car?</i>

06:36.195 --> 06:37.996
<i>Where is she going at this hour?</i>

06:37.997 --> 06:40.632
Maybe there's a third guy,
and she's cheating on Brad.

06:40.633 --> 06:41.833
What?

06:41.834 --> 06:44.736
Isn't that how you'd play it?

06:44.737 --> 06:46.404
Follow her.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.507
* Men... *

06:49.508 --> 06:50.942
Catch up.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.677
Catch up. You're gonna
lose her. Relax.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.845
This is not the first woman
I've surreptitiously followed

06:54.846 --> 06:56.947
while honoring the letter
of a restraining order.

07:00.052 --> 07:02.053
Oh. Looks like she's
heading for Malibu.

07:02.054 --> 07:03.888
Who does she know in Malibu?

07:03.889 --> 07:05.156
No idea.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.826
What the hell is that? Oh, damn.

07:08.827 --> 07:10.094
I'm out of gas.

07:10.095 --> 07:12.697
How could you be out of gas?
I don't know.

07:12.698 --> 07:15.499
I just put three dollars
in the other day.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.901
Three dollars?

07:16.902 --> 07:20.305
Actually $2.50.
I bought a Milky Way.

07:20.306 --> 07:22.207
Oh, crap!

07:22.208 --> 07:25.743
All right, we'll just
have to call Triple-A.

07:25.744 --> 07:27.445
Um...

07:27.446 --> 07:29.246
You don't have Triple-A?

07:29.247 --> 07:31.248
It costs, like, $49 a year.

07:31.249 --> 07:33.483
Charlie, I gas up three
dollars at a time!

07:33.484 --> 07:35.952
Great! Just great!

07:35.953 --> 07:36.853
Do you have Triple-A?

07:36.854 --> 07:39.889
I have Mercedes Gold Platinum Valet

07:39.890 --> 07:40.890
something or other.

07:40.891 --> 07:42.791
So? Won't they come and help us?

07:42.792 --> 07:44.326
Let's see.

07:44.327 --> 07:47.729
Will Mercedes come out to
put gas in an '89 Volvo?

07:47.730 --> 07:49.597
I'll call them to ask.

07:50.933 --> 07:54.002
You're actually waiting for
me to call, aren't you?

07:55.237 --> 07:56.771
No.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.440
Come on.

07:59.441 --> 08:01.142
We'll just have to hoof it.

08:01.143 --> 08:03.211
What, I'm supposed to
leave my car abandoned

08:03.212 --> 08:04.612
on the side of the road?

08:04.613 --> 08:06.347
What if somebody tries to steal it?

08:06.348 --> 08:07.548
Good thinking.

08:07.549 --> 08:10.118
Leave the keys, gas money,
and a thank-you note.

08:11.186 --> 08:14.422
Spoken like someone with insurance!

08:16.025 --> 08:18.060
* Men... *

08:18.829 --> 08:20.763
Oh...

08:20.764 --> 08:22.698
My feet... are killing me.

08:22.699 --> 08:24.167
Well, that's what you get

08:24.168 --> 08:26.336
for wearing those
expensive Italian loafers.

08:26.337 --> 08:28.004
They're just not made for walking.

08:28.005 --> 08:30.207
You're right.

08:33.876 --> 08:35.044
Hi, Charlie.

08:35.044 --> 08:36.078
Chels?

08:36.078 --> 08:37.313
Hey, Uncle Charlie,

08:37.313 --> 08:39.548
you look like a '70s porn star.

08:42.251 --> 08:43.585
I'm guessing.

08:43.586 --> 08:46.154
* Men... *

08:48.819 --> 08:51.086
* Men... *

08:51.087 --> 08:52.721
What are you doing here?

08:52.722 --> 08:54.456
I needed to talk to you.

08:54.457 --> 08:56.591
Okay. What's up?

08:56.592 --> 08:58.593
Um...

08:58.594 --> 09:00.061
Oh, uh, come on, Jake.

09:00.062 --> 09:01.830
Let's give them some privacy.

09:01.831 --> 09:05.233
Why? Do you think they're
gonna do it on the couch?

09:09.105 --> 09:11.273
Okay, here it is.

09:13.309 --> 09:15.677
Seeing you tonight made me realize

09:15.678 --> 09:17.579
how much I miss you.

09:17.580 --> 09:18.981
Really?

09:18.982 --> 09:21.250
Do you miss me?

09:21.251 --> 09:23.953
Oh, yeah, he's been
crying like a little girl.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.488
Will you go away!

09:25.489 --> 09:28.157
What? I'm on your side.

09:29.226 --> 09:31.928
Well, I can see nothing's
changed around here.

09:31.929 --> 09:34.331
Well, just that you're gone.

09:34.332 --> 09:35.865
And-and yes, I do miss you,

09:35.866 --> 09:38.368
and I have been crying
like a little girl.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.970
Good.

09:41.273 --> 09:43.775
So, what have you been up to?

09:44.743 --> 09:46.678
Not much. How do you like living

09:46.679 --> 09:48.480
with your dad and his boyfriend?

09:48.481 --> 09:50.015
It's a little weird.

09:50.016 --> 09:51.050
I can imagine.

09:51.051 --> 09:53.453
Two old Navy guys shacking up.

09:54.521 --> 09:56.689
The walls are pretty thin.

09:59.026 --> 10:00.226
Every night I'm hearing:

10:00.227 --> 10:02.795
"Up periscope, down periscope."

10:04.898 --> 10:07.466
"Launch the torpedo."

10:07.467 --> 10:09.101
Enough idle chitchat.

10:09.102 --> 10:11.170
What's the deal with you and Brad?

10:11.171 --> 10:13.204
He's great, but...

10:13.205 --> 10:14.906
it's just not the same.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.542
Have you two, uh...?

10:17.543 --> 10:18.809
No.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.211
Oh.

10:22.548 --> 10:26.050
Wipe that smile off your face.

10:26.051 --> 10:28.118
You wipe it off.

10:32.723 --> 10:35.325
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

10:41.531 --> 10:44.267
One question. Yeah?

10:44.268 --> 10:45.868
What was with the mustache?

10:45.869 --> 10:47.536
When I'm out with Alan,

10:47.537 --> 10:50.073
I don't like people
to recognize me.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.377
<i>Hey, they are doing it
on the couch.</i>

10:55.446 --> 10:57.948
* Men. *

10:57.949 --> 11:00.083
So what's the deal with
Uncle Charlie and Chelsea?

11:00.084 --> 11:01.084
Are they back together,

11:01.085 --> 11:02.653
or was that just a booty call?

11:02.654 --> 11:05.555
What do you know about booty calls?

11:05.556 --> 11:07.724
In theory, everything.

11:10.695 --> 11:12.262
Aw, crap.

11:12.263 --> 11:14.063
What?

11:14.064 --> 11:15.865
Just a little disappointed.

11:15.866 --> 11:18.768
I saw Chelsea's car outside.
I didn't see yours.

11:21.605 --> 11:22.806
She spent the night,

11:22.807 --> 11:24.307
but we don't know if
they're back together

11:24.308 --> 11:26.310
or if they were just
scratching the old itch.

11:27.579 --> 11:29.579
What do you know
about the old itch?

11:29.580 --> 11:31.281
It's intercourse, Dad.

11:31.282 --> 11:33.784
Why do we play these games?

11:36.221 --> 11:37.588
Good morning, all.

11:37.589 --> 11:39.257
Morning. Morning.

11:45.898 --> 11:47.632
What?

11:47.633 --> 11:49.200
Come on. Give.

11:49.201 --> 11:51.169
There's nothing to give.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.971
She came by, said she misses me,
spent the night.

11:53.972 --> 11:56.007
Yay.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.142
So is she moving back in?

11:58.143 --> 11:59.711
Is the wedding back on?

11:59.712 --> 12:02.413
Or was it just making the
beast with two backs?

12:04.183 --> 12:06.451
What is wrong with you?!

12:06.452 --> 12:09.520
I'm at an awkward age.

12:11.357 --> 12:12.757
Morning, everyone.

12:12.758 --> 12:13.825
Morning. Morning.

12:13.826 --> 12:15.092
Hey, you want coffee?

12:15.093 --> 12:17.161
Actually, I have to get
home and change for work.

12:17.162 --> 12:18.929
Oh, okay. Can we talk?

12:18.930 --> 12:20.464
Sure.

12:20.465 --> 12:22.566
Oh, that's never good.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.667
How do you know?

12:23.668 --> 12:25.936
That's what Mom said to you.

12:27.806 --> 12:29.773
So I'm thinking,
you grab some things

12:29.774 --> 12:31.175
from your dad's for tonight,

12:31.176 --> 12:33.544
and then we move all of your
stuff back this weekend.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.779
Charlie, I'm not
coming back tonight.

12:35.780 --> 12:36.981
Why not?

12:36.982 --> 12:38.282
Last night was good, right?

12:38.283 --> 12:41.651
It was great, but it
doesn't solve our problems.

12:41.652 --> 12:44.287
Sure solved mine.

12:44.288 --> 12:46.355
It's not that I don't love you,

12:46.356 --> 12:49.025
but I'm still not sure that
we have a future together.

12:49.026 --> 12:51.494
Chelsea, you're really
freaking me out here.

12:51.495 --> 12:52.795
I've got to go.

12:52.796 --> 12:55.198
Come on. Wait.

12:55.199 --> 12:56.833
Oh, I found your mustache.

12:56.834 --> 12:58.001
Where was it?

12:58.002 --> 13:00.871
Where do you think it was?
It was stuck to my ass.

13:05.411 --> 13:07.612
* Men. *

13:12.219 --> 13:16.288
Hey.

13:16.289 --> 13:18.790
Feel like talking?

13:18.791 --> 13:21.627
No, I do not.

13:21.628 --> 13:23.061
Understandable.

13:24.363 --> 13:26.764
You got to admit you're
in a better place now

13:26.765 --> 13:28.399
than you were this time last night.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.902
I mean, 24 hours ago,

13:31.903 --> 13:34.270
the woman you love was on
a date with another man.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.439
But presto-change-o, she wound up

13:36.440 --> 13:38.608
spending the night with you.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.443
Of course, come the morning,

13:40.444 --> 13:43.947
once again, she dropped
you like a lead turd.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.417
Sorry.

13:47.418 --> 13:50.153
You didn't want to talk.

13:55.092 --> 13:57.559
Me, I'm just the opposite.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.562
When I get my heart broken,
I have to talk.

14:00.563 --> 14:01.997
You cannot shut me up.

14:01.998 --> 14:04.533
Yakkity-yak-yak-yak-yak.

14:09.705 --> 14:11.206
Sorry.

14:16.546 --> 14:18.681
I've tried to be the strong,
silent type,

14:18.682 --> 14:21.117
but... it's just not who I am.

14:21.118 --> 14:23.487
I mean, not to mention there's
physical manifestations

14:23.488 --> 14:24.955
to bottling up your feelings.

14:24.956 --> 14:28.058
I mean, constipation, migraines.

14:28.059 --> 14:32.397
Or it goes the other way:
gas, diarrhea.

14:32.398 --> 14:34.899
You just cannot predict it.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.101
It's kind of an
emotional crapshoot.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.542
Crapshoot.

14:45.543 --> 14:48.311
That just came to me,
right off the top of my head.

14:50.147 --> 14:51.681
Got it.

14:55.652 --> 14:57.587
But you are lucky.

14:57.588 --> 15:01.092
You've got your music to
express your feelings.

15:01.093 --> 15:04.362
I mean, you could playthe blues.

15:08.535 --> 15:10.335
* My baby done left me *

15:14.541 --> 15:16.609
* She ain't coming back *

15:24.017 --> 15:25.117
What's going on?

15:25.118 --> 15:27.252
* I'm smothering your daddy. *

15:31.524 --> 15:33.459
* Men. *

15:40.867 --> 15:43.335
I'm just saying it
seems like every time

15:43.336 --> 15:46.305
it's my turn to pick up the crap,
he's got the runs.

15:46.306 --> 15:48.941
Well, stop feeding him chili.

15:48.942 --> 15:51.810
Oh, hey, Charlie. Hey, Charlie.

15:51.811 --> 15:53.412
Hey, Tom, Ed.

15:53.413 --> 15:54.447
Are you looking for Chelsea?

15:54.448 --> 15:56.582
No, he came to see two old queens

15:56.583 --> 15:58.017
walking a dog.

15:58.018 --> 16:01.220
Who are you calling a queen,
Elizabeth?

16:01.221 --> 16:02.522
She's not here, Charlie.

16:02.523 --> 16:04.490
She went to dinner
with that Brad guy.

16:04.491 --> 16:05.925
Oh.

16:05.926 --> 16:07.493
You want to come in, have a beer?

16:07.494 --> 16:09.362
Nah, I don't want
to bother you guys.

16:09.363 --> 16:10.496
Don't be silly. Come on.

16:10.497 --> 16:12.231
Okay, thanks.

16:13.199 --> 16:16.001
You had to tell him
she's with Brad?

16:16.002 --> 16:18.204
What, I'm supposed to lie?

16:18.205 --> 16:20.005
No, but you can dummy up.

16:20.006 --> 16:22.040
I mean, look at the poor bastard.

16:24.343 --> 16:27.212
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

16:27.213 --> 16:28.613
"I wasn't thinking."

16:28.614 --> 16:30.281
That should be your middle name.

16:30.282 --> 16:34.118
Don't be getting in my face
when I'm holding a bag of poop.

16:37.389 --> 16:38.757
I'll grab some brews.

16:38.758 --> 16:41.493
Chelsea told me about last night.

16:41.494 --> 16:43.295
I don't understand it, Tom.

16:43.296 --> 16:45.297
I thought we were back together.

16:45.298 --> 16:47.533
Yeah, well, you can't
make sense out of a woman.

16:47.534 --> 16:50.170
They're like beautiful
puzzles with missing pieces,

16:50.171 --> 16:52.238
or a great book with no ending,

16:52.239 --> 16:54.207
or like my old man used to say,

16:54.208 --> 16:56.309
"They're all friggin' nuts"

16:57.811 --> 16:59.345
I don't know what to do.

16:59.346 --> 17:01.614
Should I leave her alone?
Should I pursue her?

17:01.615 --> 17:04.550
If I might chime in.

17:04.550 --> 17:07.720
I would say that
stopping by unannounced,

17:07.721 --> 17:09.588
with some liquor store flowers,

17:09.589 --> 17:12.258
sends up a rather desperate flare.

17:12.259 --> 17:14.093
I know, I know.

17:14.094 --> 17:16.396
I just couldn't sit
home and do nothing.

17:16.396 --> 17:18.198
I keep turning it over in my mind.

17:18.199 --> 17:19.532
What did I do wrong?

17:19.534 --> 17:20.834
What could I have done differently?

17:20.835 --> 17:23.436
Man, how many times did I
ask myself that question

17:23.438 --> 17:24.872
when I was married?

17:24.873 --> 17:26.107
Me, too.

17:26.108 --> 17:28.009
What have we got
between the two of us-

17:28.010 --> 17:29.277
something like 80
years of marriage?

17:29.278 --> 17:32.648
Let's see- I was with Beth for 38,

17:32.649 --> 17:36.051
and you were with
Martha for 40, 41...

17:36.052 --> 17:38.186
I didn't need you to
actually do the math.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.254
Don't bark at me.

17:39.255 --> 17:40.888
I'll beat the snot out of you.

17:40.889 --> 17:43.490
Bring it on, mister.

17:44.626 --> 17:45.926
Maybe I should go.

17:45.927 --> 17:47.227
No, no, no, sit down.

17:47.228 --> 17:48.294
Finish your beer.

17:48.295 --> 17:49.596
We're just sparring.

17:49.597 --> 17:51.664
I love this broken-down
son of a bitch.

17:51.665 --> 17:53.666
Oh, for God's sake, don't gay it up

17:53.667 --> 17:55.201
in front of company.

17:55.202 --> 17:57.170
Now you listen to me, young man,

17:57.171 --> 17:58.838
in the final analysis,

17:58.839 --> 18:01.274
it doesn't matter what
you did or didn't do.

18:01.275 --> 18:03.077
You want Chelsea back?

18:03.078 --> 18:05.679
You've got to make her miss
you like you did last night.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.181
And she's not going to miss you

18:07.182 --> 18:08.749
if you're squatting
in her living room

18:08.750 --> 18:10.785
with those sad-ass petunias.

18:10.786 --> 18:13.655
So, what, I'm supposed to
just go about my business

18:13.656 --> 18:15.757
hoping that one day she shows up

18:15.758 --> 18:16.857
and says, "I'm back"?

18:16.858 --> 18:19.026
Or you can do like me and Ed did.

18:19.027 --> 18:21.529
Change teams.

18:21.530 --> 18:25.132
A lot easier living
with a man than a woman.

18:25.133 --> 18:27.367
Tom and I watch the same TV shows.

18:27.368 --> 18:28.901
We like the same food.

18:28.902 --> 18:31.070
You don't have to leave
the room to fart.

18:31.071 --> 18:35.174
You don't have to,
but it sure would be a nice idea.

18:36.711 --> 18:39.780
Okay, well, thanks, fellas.

18:39.781 --> 18:42.149
This was real helpful.

18:42.150 --> 18:43.851
We're always here for you, Charlie.

18:43.852 --> 18:45.419
Thank you.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.088
And don't tell
Chelsea I stopped by.

18:47.089 --> 18:48.189
I wouldn't dream of it.

18:48.190 --> 18:49.758
And remember what we told you:

18:49.759 --> 18:50.759
lay low for a while.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.227
Run silent, run deep.

18:52.228 --> 18:54.097
There you go.

18:58.235 --> 18:59.802
Well, what do you think?

18:59.803 --> 19:03.640
<i>Watch Sports Center and then
fool around a little?</i>

19:03.641 --> 19:07.944
You, uh, you need to take a Viagra?

19:07.945 --> 19:10.047
You're my Viagra, baby.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.983
Ah, that's so sweet.

19:12.984 --> 19:14.751
Just for that,
you can hold the remote.

19:17.155 --> 19:20.190
* Men. *

19:24.767 --> 19:27.135
<i>* Men. *</i>

19:27.136 --> 19:28.169
Hey.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.204
Sorry. Didn't mean to disturb you.

19:30.205 --> 19:31.639
Just grabbing a water.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.040
No, no, no, it's fine.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.575
Come on. Join me.

19:39.147 --> 19:40.948
Really?

19:40.949 --> 19:43.084
Yeah, sit down.

19:43.085 --> 19:45.586
Okay.

19:49.757 --> 19:52.326
Listen, uh,

19:52.327 --> 19:56.096
I want to apologize for...
you know...

19:56.097 --> 19:58.598
Trying to kill me with a pillow?

19:58.599 --> 20:00.500
It was horseplay.

20:00.501 --> 20:02.869
Don't make a big thing about it.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.872
What I'm saying is that I know
you were trying to cheer me up,

20:05.873 --> 20:07.974
and I appreciate it.

20:07.975 --> 20:10.677
Thank you.

20:10.678 --> 20:14.847
I realize that I give you a
hard time about living here,

20:14.848 --> 20:16.215
but frankly,

20:16.216 --> 20:20.453
it's probably a good thing to...

20:20.454 --> 20:22.421
have you around.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.359
Wow, Charlie.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.528
That means so much
to hear you say that.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.797
Well...

20:33.766 --> 20:37.201
I do... I do love you, buddy.

20:39.471 --> 20:42.406
And I love you, too.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.275
I know, I know.

20:45.276 --> 20:48.612
I don't want this
moment to ever end.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.117
Okay.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.820
I mean it. I am not letting go.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.955
Well, you're gonna have to,

20:56.956 --> 20:58.891
'cause it's starting
to get a little weird.

20:58.892 --> 21:00.292
We don't need women.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.995
We've got each other.

21:01.996 --> 21:06.099
All right, you brought
this on yourself.

21:07.258 --> 21:11.443
Don't worry. I'll wait for
you on the other side.
