what you saw over there

07:57.000 --> 07:58.262

you came out the other side

He said Michael killed you.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.944
Yeah, I don't like
to speak ill of people,

14:54.080 --> 14:58.141
but Sam is a big, fat liar
and he's a bad person

14:58.960 --> 15:00.621
and, like, freakishly tall, so...

15:00.720 --> 15:02.426
I don't understand.

No, Michael didn't...

- Yep.

For everything that
I've done to him, I think, uh,

won't admit it, you need me.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.467
You do, 'Cause we're blood.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.667
And we're not human,
no matter how much we pretend to be.

15:55.400 --> 15:59.621
See, humans are limited and fragile.

15:59.720 --> 16:03.304
And I'll admit, they bring out
the worst in me, I gotta say.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.180
It seems like, you know,
no matter how much

16:05.280 --> 16:08.181
you try to do right around them,
something always goes wrong.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.309
Follow?

16:12.800 --> 16:13.824
I know.

16:14.360 --> 16:17.067
Right? And that's not
their fault, or ours.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.267
It's just, us and humans,
we're like oil and water.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.906
You know, sardines and strawberries.
It's just a bad combination.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.337
What do we do?

16:32.320 --> 16:33.389
Leave.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.503
I mean...

16:37.440 --> 16:40.022
There's a whole universe
out there, buddy.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.981
Planets. Stars. Galaxies.

16:45.080 --> 16:49.187
Why should we stay here on Earth
when we can go aanhere else?

16:50.240 --> 16:51.787
Heck, everywhere else.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.469
Like...

16:55.520 --> 16:56.589
L/lre Star Wars?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.101
It's exactly like Star Wars.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.222
You want a lightsaber?

17:04.360 --> 17:05.782
I can make you a lightsaber.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.261
Heck, I can make you a Wookiee.

17:09.320 --> 17:14.440
But, no. Sam, Dean, and Castiel,
they'll miss me.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.866
Yes, they will.
They will. It'll be hard.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.182
But you have to live your life for you.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.309
Right?

17:25.080 --> 17:27.184
This is our second Chance, kiddo.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.542
This is our opportunity

17:30.640 --> 17:35.464
to escape our past and our sins

17:35.560 --> 17:36.777
and start over.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.664
What do you say?

17:41.440 --> 17:42.543
Father, son.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.822
You up for an adventure, buddy?

17:51.280 --> 17:52.599
I'd like that.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.939
But there's something
you need to do first.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.380
Talked to the other refugees.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.537
No one's got any idea
who'd wanna hurt Maggie.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.303
Maybe it wasn't one of them.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.389
Maybe...

18:07.640 --> 18:11.189
There are monsters in this world
that aren't monsters.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.940
Jack! Hey"

18:17.480 --> 18:18.469
Hey.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.699
Kid, what the Sam Hill?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.540
It's all right, okay? He's here to help.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.143
- He is?
- You know it, Longmire.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.066
(SOFl'LY) Call Sam. Now.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.660
So you're leaving dead bodies
on tables now.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.502
- Nice. _ _
- We were waiting,

18:47.160 --> 18:49.219
to give her a hunter's funeral.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.537
You won't have to.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.102
My father, he's gonna
bring Maggie back to life.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.743
Iam?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.743
Yeah, boys, we got a problem.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.519
Jack, what are you doing?

19:07.920 --> 19:09.137
What I have to.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.503
This...

19:13.720 --> 19:15.062
It's my second Chance.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.382
Yeah, uh, Jack,
about this resurrection stuff.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.223
It's not always a great idea because,

19:24.320 --> 19:26.959
you know, people come back different.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.057
Well, Sam didn't.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.299
Right. Well, Sam's always been
sort of different. You know what I mean?

19:33.440 --> 19:34.543
Some would say "special."

19:36.680 --> 19:37.704
No offense.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.267
You said you'd do anything.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.349
Fine.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.623
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

19:51.720 --> 19:52.709
Fine.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.422
(WHISPERS) Has he done something to you?

19:59.520 --> 20:01.624
I heard that. Heard it.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.740
Mary, everything's gonna be fine.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.029
Okay.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.822
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)

20:18.600 --> 20:19.783
Jack?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.017
Jack!

20:21.120 --> 20:22.303
He's not...

20:24.320 --> 20:25.423
He's gone.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.661
How did Michael and Lucifer
both get here?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.385
- How did they open a rift?
- You know what? It doesn't-

20:38.480 --> 20:39.583
We've gotta find Jack

20:39.680 --> 20:41.819
before Michael does
whatever the hell he's gonna do, okay?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.581
I'll call Jody and everybody else.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.177
You're gonna put out
an APB on the Devil?

20:46.280 --> 20:47.269
Yeah, I am.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.941
I'll check angel radio.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.386
Sam, even if we find Lucifer,

20:58.080 --> 20:59.183
how we gonna stop him?

21:07.160 --> 21:09.344
SAM: Maggie? Hey, sorry.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.429
You Okay?

21:11.640 --> 21:13.107
I'm alive, so...

21:14.000 --> 21:15.024
Yes.

21:15.840 --> 21:16.829
Right.

21:18.480 --> 21:23.224
Listen, I know this is weird, so weird,

21:23.320 --> 21:27.939
but, um, before you died,

21:28.040 --> 21:31.225
do you remember anything
about the person that killed you?

21:32.920 --> 21:34.239
Does it matter?

21:34.320 --> 21:37.300
Kind of seems like you have
bigger, you know,

21:37.440 --> 21:39.101
Satan-y problems.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.987
Yeah, but we're dealing with those.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.183
Mostly.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.826
But, yes, it does matter.
It matters to me.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.939
I never saw his face, but...

21:58.480 --> 21:59.981
I saw his eyes.

22:15.320 --> 22:16.947
Magnificent, isn't it?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.067
It really is.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.661
All right, Jody's lookin'. So far, nada.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.059
Yeah, angel radio is nothing but static,
which is disturbing.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.020
Great. Well, we'll just
add that to the list.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.159
So what do we do now?

22:32.640 --> 22:34.028
(LOUD BOOM)

22:34.880 --> 22:36.222
(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

22:37.200 --> 22:38.337
What's happening?

22:42.720 --> 22:43.982
What the hell?

22:44.840 --> 22:46.626
(POUNDING)

22:47.000 --> 22:48.183
Oh, no.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.582
What the hell is that?

22:50.720 --> 22:52.745
Mom, Bobby, take Maggie,
get her out of here.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.740
- Go through the garage.
- We'll buy you some time.

22:54.840 --> 22:55.864
No!

22:57.160 --> 22:58.377
- Mom!
- Please!

22:59.720 --> 23:01.938
- Go.
- Go!

23:02.240 --> 23:03.741
(THUNDEROUS NOISE)

23:27.920 --> 23:28.909
(GUNS COCK)

23:47.920 --> 23:50.104
You really thought
you could run from me?

23:57.920 --> 23:59.239
(MOA/V5
m
PAIN)

24:07.920 --> 24:09.626
- Yeah, how did you-
- Get here?

24:09.760 --> 24:11.500
Easy. I made a deal.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.581
I saw how they do the Spell.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.623
I know what it takes.

24:15.720 --> 24:19.599
It's some blood, some fruit,
a glovw rock, and then...

24:20.320 --> 24:22.823
Bam. We step through, both of us.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.943
(CHOKES)

24:25.040 --> 24:26.985
And now, this world is mine.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.389
I can save it, purge it of sin.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.381
Yeah, 'cause that
really worked on your rock.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.062
I'm not perfect. Yes, I made mistakes.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.259
But second time's the Charm.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.264
And you, Dean Winchester,

24:43.360 --> 24:48.229
will be the first life that I take
in this world, first soul I save.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.180
Some would consider that an honor.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.259
Well, as Shakespeare once said,

24:55.040 --> 24:57.099
eat me, dick bag.

25:00.480 --> 25:01.981
Jack,JaCk.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.067
Jack, I don't know where you are,

25:04.160 --> 25:06.424
and I don't even know
if you can hear this prayer,

25:06.520 --> 25:07.942
but we need you.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.297
We need you.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.101
Look at all those worlds, Jack.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.426
We're gonna take the grand tour, buddy.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.468
We're gonna explore every nook
and cranny of creation.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.300
We might even learn something,

25:27.280 --> 25:29.862
maybe come up with some improvements.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.297
Improvements?

25:34.320 --> 25:36.663
Yeah, yeah. We'll talk about that later.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.819
5AM: Jack, Jack, I don’t/(now
where you are,

25:42.920 --> 25:44.785
. and I don ’t even know
If you can hear th/s prayer.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.982
We need you.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.639
LUCIFER: What's up, buddy?

25:55.720 --> 25:56.857
You all right?

25:58.240 --> 25:59.377
(STRANGLED GRUNT)

25:59.480 --> 26:02.699
Could've done this quick,
but I wanted to enjoy it,

26:02.800 --> 26:06.258
that moment when the soul
leaves the body,

26:06.360 --> 26:07.827
it's beautiful.

26:11.560 --> 26:12.584
(YELLS)

26:17.000 --> 26:18.137
Jack.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.399
I heard your prayer.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.822
Yeah, it's me. Yay!

26:26.200 --> 26:27.827
We done, buddy?

26:33.760 --> 26:35.079
Buddy?

26:35.160 --> 26:36.422
You hurt my friends.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.867
(CHOKES)

26:39.560 --> 26:41.141
You hurt my family!

26:41.600 --> 26:43.306
(SCREAMS)

26:43.600 --> 26:44.589
Whoa.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.187
Lucifer, we- We had a deal!

26:53.280 --> 26:56.022
Okay, game over.
Hey, buddy, let's, let's...

26:56.840 --> 26:58.182
Split, okay?

26:58.280 --> 26:59.702
What does he mean?

27:02.360 --> 27:05.261
I don't know. I didn't- I didn't hear.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.622
They had a deal.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.379
Lucifer gets you
and Michael gets everything else.

27:12.640 --> 27:16.588
He's gonna nuke our world, Jack,
just like he did his.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.759
- Is that true?
- No! It's not.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.101
Is that why you wanted us to leave?

27:23.840 --> 27:24.977
Leave?

27:26.880 --> 27:28.620
He said...

27:28.720 --> 27:30.426
He said we'd go to the stars.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.624
What, and you're just gonna
leave the rest of us here to burn?

27:34.720 --> 27:36.585
Okay. Hold on a second.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.819
Let's slow down, 'cause I...

27:40.400 --> 27:42.345
I'm not currently the bad guy here.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.657
Yeah, tell that to Maggie.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.542
What about Maggie?

27:46.640 --> 27:49.017
Maggie saw the eyes
of the person who killed her,

27:49.880 --> 27:52.462
the glowing, red eyes.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.504
(LAUGHS) You're gonna believe this guy?

27:56.840 --> 27:58.580
- Come on, man! Sam's a hater!
- Tell me.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.420
He would say anything
to get you on his side.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.737
Tell me the truth!

28:06.320 --> 28:10.586
She saw me when I was
scouting out the bunker.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.137
She saw me and She screamed,

28:15.160 --> 28:17.902
so I crushed her skull
with my bare hands.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.423
And it was warm and wet, and I liked it.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.702
You're not my father.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.262
You're a monster.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.639
Come on, man!

28:48.600 --> 28:50.147
(SCREAMS)

28:57.160 --> 28:58.229
Okay.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.061
I tried with you.

29:01.160 --> 29:04.584
I really tried with you.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.620
Everything you told me was a lie.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.382
Because I told you
what you wanted to hear, man.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.540
So what? I killed the girl! Big deal!

29:11.640 --> 29:13.858
She's a- She's a human!
She doesn't matter!

29:13.960 --> 29:14.984
So am I!

29:15.640 --> 29:16.664
Yeah?

29:17.120 --> 29:18.621
And that's your problem.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.061
You're too much like your mother.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.303
Jack".

29:23.400 --> 29:24.469
Stay back.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.622
I'll handle him.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.709
Will you?

29:32.120 --> 29:33.223
Oh, buddy.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.385
We could've been something, you and me.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.146
We could've remade the universe.
It would've been great.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.378
We could've been better gods than Dad.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.062
And I really wanted that, pal.
I wanted that.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.061
But now,
if I can't have it with you, I...

29:51.480 --> 29:52.697
I don't need ya.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.063
I just need your power.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.102
-Jack!
- No!

30:12.080 --> 30:13.661
- Jack.
- Sammy!

30:14.160 --> 30:15.184
Jack!

30:19.680 --> 30:20.942
Sammy!

30:37.160 --> 30:39.469
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.577
MICHAEL: The Devil won.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.942
That's what happened.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.349
(GRU NTS)

30:52.440 --> 30:53.702
(STRANGLED BREATH)

30:59.320 --> 31:01.026
Really, Sam? Hitching a ride?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.759
I mean, do you ever quit?

31:04.520 --> 31:06.260
- Go to hell.
- Hell, yeah.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.066
Been there. Done that.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.142
How do we stop him?

31:13.760 --> 31:14.863
You don't.

31:16.080 --> 31:20.221
After consuming the Nephilim's
grace, Lucifer's juiced up.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.299
He'll kill the boy, your brother.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.862
Hell, he could end the whole universe
if he put his mind to it.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.260
And you thought I was bad.

31:33.640 --> 31:36.097
No. No, you beat him. I saw you.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.987
When he was weaker, and I was stronger.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.218
Believe me,
I'd love to rip my brother apart.

31:44.240 --> 31:47.425
But now in this banged up meatsuit...

31:47.520 --> 31:48.509
(WHEEZES)

31:49.560 --> 31:50.879
Not happening.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.301
This is the end, of everything.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.229
No.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.217
What if...

32:06.800 --> 32:08.017
What if you had your sword?

32:10.360 --> 32:11.782
(GASPS)

32:11.880 --> 32:14.064
You know, it's been real fun.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.658
I really had a great time with you,
but I think we should see other people.

32:19.680 --> 32:20.783
What do you say?

32:24.400 --> 32:25.583
(SCREAMS)

32:28.040 --> 32:29.257
JACK: Stop!

32:32.840 --> 32:34.819
Now, why should I listen to you?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.023
Because...

32:37.080 --> 32:38.900
- I'm your son.
- Oh, yeah.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.661
Well, you had a Chance with that, but...

32:41.280 --> 32:42.304
N ow?

32:46.200 --> 32:49.101
As for kids, I can make more of those.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.662
Daddy Sammy coming to the rescue.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.461
But your little Jackie,

33:01.560 --> 33:04.905
the nougat-loving boy
that you had before,

33:05.000 --> 33:06.388
he's killed people.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.937
He's got lots of blood on his hands.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.543
I don't care.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.344
He's family.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.509
LUCIFER: Ha!

33:16.480 --> 33:18.107
What's family done for anybody?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.103
My dad left me.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.385
My brothers tried to kill me. A lot.

33:24.520 --> 33:26.704
Family blows.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.017
I'm gonna prove it to you.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.984
What, by killing me? Go ahead.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.142
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.224
He is.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.026
Dean,no.

33:49.680 --> 33:50.999
I am your sword.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.181
It's you. You're the Michael Sword.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.497
Your perfect vessel.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.819
ZACHARIAH: Why do you think you two
are the vessels?

33:59.920 --> 34:02.946
Michael and Lucifer.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.780
You were born to this, boys.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.425
With me, you'd be stronger
than you've ever been.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.461
I know what you are.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.699
If we work together,
can we beat Lucifer?

34:16.800 --> 34:18.665
- Dean-
- Can we?

34:20.520 --> 34:21.737
We'd have a Chance.

34:23.680 --> 34:25.420
Dean, you can't.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.147
Lucifer has Sam.

34:27.480 --> 34:28.822
He has Jack.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.587
Cass, I don't have a Choice!

34:33.320 --> 34:36.505
If we do this, it's a onetime deal.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.457
I'm in charge.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.417
You're the engine,
but I'm behind the wheel.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.737
Understand?

34:47.520 --> 34:50.660
Now I could-
I probably should execute you.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.919
I mean, really, really
use my imagination.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.501
But I'm feeling generous today.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.307
So one of you is gonna
walk out that door,

34:58.400 --> 35:00.584
and the other one will be
laying dead on the ground.

35:01.960 --> 35:02.984
You Choose.

35:08.480 --> 35:09.504
No.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.420
Or you could do that
and I can murder you both

35:11.520 --> 35:13.067
and end all life in the universe.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.840
Remake it in my image,
better than Dad ever could.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.822
I'm thinkin', mmm...

35:21.080 --> 35:22.707
Fire-breathing dragons,

35:23.320 --> 35:25.106
sassy
talking robots.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.744
I might give humans another chance
if they know their place

35:27.840 --> 35:30.866
and worship me, 'cause I've earned it.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.940
But, hey, it'll probably take a few days
to unravel the universe,

35:34.040 --> 35:36.179
maybe seven, 10 days tops.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.904
So maybe, just maybe,
one of you could stop me.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.703
Maybe.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.745
Well, let's see. Clock's ticking, guys.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.469
Kill me.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.297
- What?
- Kill me.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.627
You can stop him, Jack.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.267
You can get your power back.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.783
No, I can't. I can't beat him.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.505
- But you can.
- What?

36:43.360 --> 36:44.907
I know you can.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.820
No, no, no, no, no. Jack.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.744
Don't! Jack!

36:50.560 --> 36:51.584
Jack!

36:51.680 --> 36:54.467
I love you. I love all of you.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.822
Jack, don't! Don't!

37:15.280 --> 37:16.304
Dean?

37:20.120 --> 37:21.109
Hiya, Sammy.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.547
You let my brother in.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.784
Well, turns out, he and I
have something in common.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.620
We both wanna gut your ass.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.697
(YELLS)

38:30.480 --> 38:31.504
Well...

38:32.320 --> 38:34.777
Good try, Dean.
I'll give you that, buddy.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.427
I'm not just powerful now.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.217
I am power.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.664
And I don't need a blade
to end you, pal.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.263
Dean!

38:47.040 --> 38:48.667
Goodbye, Dean.

39:00.640 --> 39:03.905
(SCREAMING)

39:49.640 --> 39:50.902
Is he...

39:52.360 --> 39:53.384
He...

39:54.000 --> 39:55.103
He's dead.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.149
Holy crap.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.559
You did it.

40:05.680 --> 40:06.704
No.

40:08.680 --> 40:09.942
No, we did it.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.303
We did it.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.137
(GROANING)

40:19.400 --> 40:20.469
Dean?

40:21.320 --> 40:22.639
(CHOKES)

40:26.680 --> 40:28.898
- Dean!
- We had a deal!

40:36.040 --> 40:37.143
Michael?

40:46.240 --> 40:47.502
Thanks for the suit.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.069
