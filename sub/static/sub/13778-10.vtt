WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.204
(siren wailing)

00:03.253 --> 00:05.995
This is 1504, en route to intercept.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.538
(dispatcher on radio) Copy, 1504.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.627
— Hope you're enjoying this.
— Yeah. Why is that?

00:09.676 --> 00:12.759
Oh, me and you, driving fast,
chasing bad guys.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.840
This really might be the last time
we do this together.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.926
Oh, you miss me already.
That's sweet.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.226
You're probably not even gonna go.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.681
You want action?

00:21.730 --> 00:23.595
Okay, no, what I want
is to catch this guy.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.514
And you know what?
If he's supposed to be on Route 9,

00:25.567 --> 00:26.977
we should've seen him by now.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.233
Unless he changed his plan.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.189
That does happen, just not to you.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.354
Huh.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.987
(tires skid)

00:35.827 --> 00:36.782
(siren whoops)

00:36.828 --> 00:37.817
(steam hissing)

00:39.248 --> 00:41.204
This is 1504. We got an 11—80,

00:41.250 --> 00:43.582
Route 9, north of Exit 56.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.835
(Andy) Looks like it rolled, but——

00:50.884 --> 00:51.839
— (gunshots)
- ( gaerS)

00:51.885 --> 00:53.466
Down! Down! Down! Down!

00:53.512 --> 00:56.345
—(panﬂng)
— You all right?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.005
Yeah.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.640
Well, you said you wanted action.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.851
1504, shots fired. Repeat——shots fired.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.640
Route 9, north of Exit 56.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.605
Request immediate backup.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.269
(dispatcher) 10—4. All units...

01:12.322 --> 01:14.187
— Sam, somebody's in the car.
— 1504 heard shots fired.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.402
Route 9, north of Exit 56.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.316
Available units, please respond.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.124
(woman) Oh, my God.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.625
(groans)

01:28.672 --> 01:30.333
Ma'am, are you okay?

01:30.382 --> 01:32.668
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.709
lt's just——| don't know
what happened. I just——

01:34.761 --> 01:37.468
You've been in a car accident.
Do you remember getting hit?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.175
No, not really.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.762
l was——| was driving,
and a car came flying around——

01:42.811 --> 01:44.347
around the bend,
and into my lane and——

01:44.396 --> 01:46.182
Okay. Do you know your name?

01:46.231 --> 01:47.846
Yeah.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.981
Leslie Atkins.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.983
l'm——l'm fine, though.
I'm fine. I'm just——

01:52.029 --> 01:53.485
So we gotta get her out of there,
all right?

01:53.530 --> 01:56.021
— Okay.
— Okay, ljust——um, I need help,

01:56.074 --> 01:57.735
'cause, um, l'm pinned under this...

01:57.784 --> 01:58.739
Okay, yep.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.991
Okay.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.619
Uh, Sam?

02:02.664 --> 02:05.406
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.451
It's okay. Just relax. Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.368
Dispatch, we need EMS.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.629
Got one victim,
conscious and breathing,

02:12.674 --> 02:14.756
pinned inside her car,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.292
serious laceration on her right leg.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.461
(trunk latch clanks)

02:20.223 --> 02:21.429
(dispatcher) Copy that, 1504.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.433
Working on getting you EMS and Fire.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.843
What do you mean, "working on it"?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.477
(Andy) How bad is it?

02:27.522 --> 02:30.434
Uh, you know, it's pretty——
it's pretty, um——

02:30.484 --> 02:32.440
lt's——lt's not that bad.

02:32.486 --> 02:36.445
Wow. You're a really terrible liar.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.778
Uh, let's just say it's definitely
gonna leave a mark.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.692
Step one——examine the wound,

02:42.746 --> 02:45.112
make sure there's
no obvious dirt or debris.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.076
Ow! My——Sorry. Okay?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.865
Leslie, here's what's gonna happen.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.494
I'm gonna wait until my partner shows up,
we're gonna wrap this up,

02:51.546 --> 02:53.002
and then the medics
from the Fire Department

02:53.048 --> 02:54.663
are gonna come here
and get you out of here.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.956
Does that sound good?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.510
Yeah, that sounds great.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.507
McNally.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.418
Great.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.427
How's she doing?

03:01.473 --> 03:03.384
Okay, laceration's deep.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.344
I think her leg might be broken,
but it's fairly clean.

03:05.394 --> 03:06.349
We got another problem.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.351
They got a high—rise fire
on East Lakeshore.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.479
All fire and medics
in the zone are there.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.764
What about us?

03:11.817 --> 03:13.273
They're sending units from District 3.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.774
That's over 20 minutes away.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.060
I mean, the girl's leg
is bleeding like crazy.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.444
McNally, you've been trained.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.525
You know what to do.
Get pressure on the wound,

03:19.574 --> 03:21.110
patch it up to stem the bleeding,

03:21.159 --> 03:23.536
and do what you gotta do
to keep her calm and conscious

03:23.578 --> 03:25.830
until the medics get here.
Okay? All right?

03:25.872 --> 03:27.282
Yes.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.197
Where are you going?

03:29.251 --> 03:31.162
The debris goes
about a hundred yards up.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.291
That's where the shots came from.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.372
I'm gonna have a look.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.411
Here's the bag.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.959
Okay.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.756
Change of plans.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.263
What are you talking about?
(panﬂng)

03:45.308 --> 03:47.014
Don't worry.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.096
It's gonna be fine.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.137
(police radio chatter)

03:54.151 --> 03:56.608
(Andy) This is all wrong.
What are we even doing here?

03:56.653 --> 03:57.859
What is wrong with it?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.690
It's a studio, great neighborhood.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.731
It's, most importantly,
in your price range.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.320
Yeah, it's facing north.
It's not bright enough.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.117
You know, this isn't just a condo
I'm buying, Traci, it's my future,

04:09.166 --> 04:11.748
and my future needs
a lot of natural light.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.993
(scoffs) It doesn't even have parking.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.207
— You don't even have a car.
— Future me does.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.498
ls future you hooking up
with Sam Swarek?

04:19.551 --> 04:20.791
Inappropriate.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.755
You knew it was
gonna come up eventually.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.089
Luke and | just broke up.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.720
Yeah, over a month ago,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.256
and I know you're still in mourning,

04:27.309 --> 04:29.641
but sometimes the best way
to get over somebody

04:29.686 --> 04:30.892
is to get under somebody else.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.189
Again, completely inappropriate.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.096
He's not your training officer anymore.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.310
No way.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.020
Okay, those are not in my plans,

04:38.069 --> 04:40.355
and I'm still a rookie.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.648
And, you know, just getting out
of this relationship, I...

04:44.701 --> 04:47.943
gotta lie low
and get my act together.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.782
How long's that gonna take?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.239
I promise if anything happens,

04:52.292 --> 04:53.907
— you'll be the first to know.
— Good,

04:53.960 --> 04:55.996
especially if you want to see
that bright future of yours.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.332
(laughs) Okay,
we gotta get outta here.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.337
We have three more places
to look at before shift starts.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.714
They're all facing south.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.091
One of those places is
gonna be my new home.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.091
— Really?
— Mm—hmm.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.048
What makes you so sure?

05:06.097 --> 05:08.429
Just have a feeling
this is gonna be a good day.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.346
(inhales sharply)

05:12.395 --> 05:14.226
2 minutes, 30 seconds.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.649
I can see the time. Don't need
you to keep reminding me.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.192
Is that our game console?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.520
It's my game console.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.560
Well, you're erasing
all my high scores.

05:21.613 --> 05:22.819
We're just using it as a prop.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.776
I'm teaching Dov to defuse an lED
using a controlled blast.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.987
Oh. Fun.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.071
Sue doesn't think I can do it,

05:29.120 --> 05:31.702
but I've already grounded,
the 0—4 is in place,

05:31.748 --> 05:34.114
and I got the detonator.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.453
Good. Now you just have to secure
the det before you're timed out.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.085
Oh, boom. You're done.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.540
(mouth full) But I still
have two minutes.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.751
You put the detonator
in your mouth.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.258
If it sparks, it's got enough charge
to blow off your face.

05:45.303 --> 05:49.467
And I would hate it if something
happened to this face.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.427
(chuckles)

05:51.476 --> 05:53.057
(console beeps)

05:53.103 --> 05:54.968
Oh, it's the remote detonator.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.137
I guess you're both dead.

05:58.984 --> 05:59.973
(chuckles)

06:01.945 --> 06:03.936
(Sam humming a tune)

06:07.284 --> 06:09.320
Can't say I miss wearing one of those.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.661
Well, that's 'cause you never
made it look as good as I do.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.039
Oh.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.496
Flattered as I am, uh, tell me
you didn't come down here

06:18.545 --> 06:20.331
just to watch me suit up.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.620
What do you know
about James Brennan?

06:21.673 --> 06:22.913
— Jamie Brennan?
— Mm—hmm.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.206
Forget it, man.
He's out of the life,

06:24.259 --> 06:25.465
has been for years.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.296
It's all about the wife and the kid

06:27.345 --> 06:28.960
and the two—car garage in Brampton.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.629
Not anymore.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.845
Wife and daughter were killed
in a car accident two months ago.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.385
lntel says Jamie's not doing so well.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.521
And you think now might be
a good time to try to work him?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.807
Sammy, this guy is an enforcer.
He's a serious player.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.191
This might be our only chance.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.861
l'm, uh, putting together a team of guys
who know the case.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.240
(clears throat) When?

06:51.286 --> 06:52.992
— Couple weeks.
— A couple weeks?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.198
Got a guy who can make an introduction,

06:54.247 --> 06:55.703
get you in the inside, working for him.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.580
We'll take it from there.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.912
And here's mejust getting used
to sleeping in my own bed again.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.294
As good as you think
it makes you look,

07:03.340 --> 07:05.752
uniform's a straitjacket for you.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.882
Okay, well, I'm gonna
let you think about it.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.591
(overlapping conversations)

07:18.980 --> 07:20.060
Officer Nash.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.767
Detective Barber.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.397
Didn't see your car
in the parking lot.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.559
Thought you called in sick
after your big game last night.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.274
What, me? Never.
No, ljust dropped it off in the shop

07:28.323 --> 07:29.563
for a little——little tuneup.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.608
What? Stella's feeling
a little under the weather?

07:32.661 --> 07:35.277
No, ljust thought
I'd get her shipshape

07:35.330 --> 07:37.946
in case I, you know, sell her.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.409
What are you talking about?
That car's your baby.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.371
It's just a car.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.582
Besides, why drive a chick magnet

07:45.632 --> 07:48.374
when you already have
the woman of your dreams?

07:49.552 --> 07:50.883
Very smooth, Detective.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.885
Oh, you see that? | just exude cool.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.091
I don't need a hot sports car.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.392
You know, if you have to point it out,
it's a lot less cool.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.050
Y—You're right.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.265
Uaughs)

08:08.530 --> 08:09.986
— Hey.
— Hey.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.658
So you and Sue seem pretty happy.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.699
Yeah, we are.
She's, uh——She's great.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.867
It's good. It's good,

08:23.920 --> 08:26.662
you know, the fact that she's ETF
doesn't make you feel uncomfortable.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.671
I mean, that's——that's
something, you know.

08:28.717 --> 08:31.880
Nope. Like I said,
she's great.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.884
Dov.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.307
Look, about what happened,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.598
| just want to be clear.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.640
What do you mean?

08:47.694 --> 08:48.809
You don't remember?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.272
Why am I not surprised?
You were totally high,

08:53.324 --> 08:57.192
and it's not like you meant
what you said.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.746
Of course not.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.325
Let's just forget it happened.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.490
Okay.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.908
That's a good plan.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.501
She's lifted six purses
in the last two weeks,

09:10.550 --> 09:14.088
so when you bring her in,
keep your hands on your wallets.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.126
Moving on.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.762
I spoke to headquarters this morning
about the new squad cars.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.672
(Noelle) Yes!
Bring on the equalizers.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.637
Forget about the, uh, equalizers.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.846
They say it's not
in the budget this year.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.477
— What?
— I know.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.262
It means that we're gonna be driving
the same smelly, broke—ass cars

09:26.316 --> 09:28.307
for the next year or two.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.101
So serve, protect, and drive careful.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.361
They gotta last.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.397
(overlapping conversations)

09:38.620 --> 09:40.576
Hey, uh...

09:40.622 --> 09:43.034
Looks like I'm with Oliver,
and you have 1507 with Dov.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.493
Yeah, can you switch with me?
I want to——

09:44.542 --> 09:46.533
— I want to ride with Oliver.
— Are you sure?

09:46.586 --> 09:47.701
You know you're gonna have
to buy him lunch, right?

09:47.754 --> 09:48.584
Yeah, I know. I know.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.292
And listen to those CDs
of his cousin's blues band?

09:51.341 --> 09:54.128
Yeah? So? I like them.
They're bluesy.

09:54.177 --> 09:57.920
All right. Hey, I'm riding with you.
Gail wants to switch.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.679
Ah, great. We can go to that restaurant
with the bacon—flavored curly fries.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.807
Dude, yes.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.467
(Oliver) Dude.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.264
(helicopter hovering)

10:10.735 --> 10:12.111
That your new place?

10:12.153 --> 10:14.235
Yeah. I'm trying to decide
between these two.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.942
I still think this one
feels way more me, though.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.198
I know that building.
It used to be a toilet factory.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.236
Well, it's not anymore.
It's actually very nice.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.324
— lt's comfortable, quiet——
— If you got any problems,

10:24.374 --> 10:26.706
just take the back off
and rattle the chain.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.707
Anyways, I'm going to the bank
tomorrow morning.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.129
— Mm—hmm.
— First—time buyer,

10:30.171 --> 10:32.548
so I get a 4.5% fixed rate
on a 20—year mortgage.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.545
20 years?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.252
What, you think I should do 25?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.166
No, it's just a hell of a commitment.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.302
Well, I'm obviously not
gonna stay there for 20 years.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.134
You know, stay for five,
wait till it appreciates,

10:42.183 --> 10:44.390
flip it, then move to another
neighborhood, do the same thing,

10:44.435 --> 10:46.892
and eventually I'll have my great place
in The Beaches.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.599
— Ah, The Beaches.
— Or Bloor West.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.603
You know, I'm flexible.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.310
5—year plan, 10—year plan.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.439
You got it all figured out.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.271
Yeah. Plan's good.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.027
I bet you were one of those kids
that saved her Halloween candy

10:57.073 --> 10:58.779
and made it last all year, huh?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.941
What, and you were the kid
that ate all his candy in one night?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.110
No, just the good stuff.
Then I threw the rest out.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.074
See, you can't do that.
You gotta save the good stuff.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.283
Save it? What for?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.584
— For what?
— I don't know. Later.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.617
(police radio chatter)

11:13.673 --> 11:15.254
(crow caws)

11:15.300 --> 11:17.837
(exhales deeply)

11:17.886 --> 11:19.126
Okay, so ljust need you to look up.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.294
What are you doing?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.007
Listen, you might have a concussion,

11:22.056 --> 11:23.967
so I just need to make sure
that your pupils are equal

11:24.017 --> 11:25.132
and reacting to light.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.516
| just have a couple questions, okay?

11:26.561 --> 11:27.516
— Okay.
— Okay.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.268
What do you do for a living?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.430
I'm a musician.
I'm a songwriter.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.609
Really? Like on the radio?

11:33.651 --> 11:36.028
Not all songwriters
are on the radio.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.277
Oh. I guess.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.071
Nothing's 100% finished yet.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.236
I don't want to put anything out
until it's ready, you know?

11:46.289 --> 11:48.575
Yeah, that's totally understandable.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.490
Okay, I'm gonna try
to clean this up.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.410
It might hurt a little bit.
Gotta get the glass out, okay?

11:53.463 --> 11:55.749
Okay.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.084
All right, so, um,
what else do you have to do?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.635
You know, what's left?

11:59.677 --> 12:01.053
I just have to do
a couple more tracks...

12:01.095 --> 12:02.835
— Mm—hmm.
— and then I'm finished

12:02.889 --> 12:06.052
probably, like,
in the next two months or so.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.261
Really? That's right
around the corner.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.517
I know.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.184
Yeah.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.941
l have this really amazing
bottle of champagne

12:16.986 --> 12:20.103
just sitting in my apartment,
waiting for me,

12:20.156 --> 12:21.566
to celebrate when I'm done.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.152
Well, that's gonna taste great.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.441
Yeah.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.782
Why is it bleeding through?

12:28.831 --> 12:31.789
Uh...| don't know.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.335
— Wasn't it supposed to stop?
— Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.334
No, l have to wrap it
a little bit tighter.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.041
Oh, my——Oh, my God.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.671
Okay, okay, okay,
here's what's gonna happen——

12:38.716 --> 12:40.798
Just relax, okay?
I'm gonna wrap a little bit tighter,

12:40.843 --> 12:43.835
and then if that doesn't work, uh...

12:43.888 --> 12:46.345
I'm gonna put a tourniquet on it
and cut the blood flow, okay?

12:46.391 --> 12:47.881
— No, l don't——| don't want——
— No, no, no, it's okay...

12:47.934 --> 12:48.889
I don't want you
to touch it anymore.

12:48.935 --> 12:49.890
| just want you to leave it.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.551
It's not gonna be long now.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.767
I promise. It's okay.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.443
(children shouting indistinctly)

13:01.489 --> 13:03.320
(woman) Thank God you're here.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.856
He shot Ricky.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.195
This is Partytown.
This isn't supposed to happen.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.327
Just, uh, start at the beginning,

13:09.372 --> 13:10.953
and tell us what happened.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.739
Well, I was getting changed
out back, you know,

13:12.792 --> 13:14.157
trying to keep the magic alive,

13:14.210 --> 13:16.451
when, uh,
I saw the office door was open,

13:16.504 --> 13:17.835
and l poked my head in,

13:17.880 --> 13:20.087
and there was a guy
digging through the desk.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.670
He took the cash box——
over $4,000——

13:24.887 --> 13:26.752
I'd be surprised,
big chicken coming at me.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.262
Before I could say anything,

13:28.308 --> 13:31.471
he took a shot at me, I fell back,
and he ran out the back door.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.725
Did you see what he looked like?

13:32.770 --> 13:34.021
Hard to tell.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.178
I had the chicken head on.

13:35.231 --> 13:39.349
Uh, white, 30s maybe.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.438
It happened pretty fast.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.650
I'm used to getting kicked,
and I'm used to getting punched,

13:44.699 --> 13:46.235
but this one...

13:46.284 --> 13:47.740
kinda took me by surprise.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.569
All right, all right,
everybody follow me.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.874
It's okay. We just need to close
things down for a little while.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.702
Keep going.
All the——Al| right.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.993
Why would somebody shoot
the mascot at a kids' playland?

13:58.046 --> 13:59.331
That's like shooting your nana.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.961
Your nana dressed up
in a giant chicken suit?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.123
You know what? Never mind.
I don't want to know.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.132
Oh, excuse me, ma'am?
Are these your kids?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.133
We'll need you
to take them outside.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.840
What the hell is going on?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.345
There's been an incident.
We need to clear everybody out.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.721
I would love to, believe me.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.473
It's my son's sixth birthday party.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.055
We have 18 kids here
eating and puking

14:15.104 --> 14:16.605
and hiding and screaming.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.387
This place is pretty awesome.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.308
l mean——(clears throat)
You know, for kids.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.851
Yeah, it's chaos.
People started screaming.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.441
The kids all took off.
We're still missing two.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.232
What are the boys' names?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.991
— Elliot and...Nathan.
— Good.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.743
They're little jackasses,
the both of them.

14:32.789 --> 14:33.653
I should never have let them come.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.661
I mean, they don't listen to anybody,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.208
not even their own mothers.
It's not just me.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.162
Okay, look, I'm a dad.
|——| get this.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.543
All right, kids come
into a place like this,

14:40.588 --> 14:42.704
and their brains turn
to cotton candy, right?

14:42.757 --> 14:44.167
I'm sure that they're
just hiding somewhere.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.172
— Okay.
— And what I want you to do

14:45.218 --> 14:47.129
is take Maria out to the van

14:47.178 --> 14:48.714
— and wait with the other kids.
— Okay.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.378
Okay, we will find the boys.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.511
— Okay.
— Okay?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.172
— Thank you.
— Yes. Okay.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.684
Okay, pain—in—the—ass little kids aside,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.139
we gotta remember
what we're doing here,

14:58.189 --> 14:59.804
and we've gotta talk to witnesses,

14:59.857 --> 15:01.313
take statements.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.645
All right, see if somebody saw
who shot the bird man

15:03.694 --> 15:05.104
right...in the pecker.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.485
There's video surveillance.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.647
It's ancient,
but it might have something.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.075
Good. Start there.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.358
See if there's cameras
outside the office.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.322
What about the two kids?

15:13.371 --> 15:15.953
You and me, we'll fan out, okay,
see if we can flush 'em loose.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.489
Okay, Peck, you're gonna
pull video with Epstein.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.534
Uh, actually, sir, if you don't mind,

15:20.586 --> 15:21.996
I'd like to help find those boys.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.627
I mean, after all,
they are just children,

15:23.673 --> 15:25.959
and they are our future.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.044
Okay. Whatever. Go. Go.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.334
Okay.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.376
Go.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.672
(police radio chatter)

15:33.724 --> 15:35.464
Well, it looks to me
like our guy came in

15:35.518 --> 15:37.224
though the back door
by the office,

15:37.270 --> 15:40.683
but Janice the manager claims that
that door is permanently locked.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.141
Yeah, well, ljust spoke
to three different people

15:42.191 --> 15:44.182
who all said that they saw
a red hatchback peel out

15:44.235 --> 15:45.850
of the parking lot right after
the shots were fired.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.440
Getaway car. Good enough for me.
Let's get a BOLO out,

15:48.489 --> 15:50.104
sweep the neighborhood,
see what we see.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.489
What, you think
he's still in the area?

15:51.534 --> 15:54.116
Well, remember,
most armed robberies happen

15:54.162 --> 15:55.868
within 10 blocks
of the bad guy's house.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.869
— They hit places they know.
— That's very stupid.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.416
Or they haven't heard
the expression

15:59.459 --> 16:00.619
"Don't shoot where you eat."

16:02.712 --> 16:03.747
(woman) Elliot?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.832
Yoo—hoo! Children?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.793
— Nathan?
— We're the police.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.798
Get your damn asses out here.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.459
Hard to believe that didn't work.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.678
What's up with you and Dov?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.931
What? Nothing's up.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.477
What do you mean?

16:18.519 --> 16:20.020
I don't know. I mean...

16:20.062 --> 16:21.848
ever since you guys
worked the gang case,

16:21.898 --> 16:23.434
you've barely spoken
to each other.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.973
I mean, you've been weird
with each other all week.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.017
Yeah, Dov's weird with everybody.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.229
lt's genetic.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.021
All right, fine. I'll just ask him.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.485
Chris, it's——(sighs)

16:33.534 --> 16:34.614
It's fine.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.946
Well, no, I mean, it's not fine.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.236
You're his roommate, too.
You pay rent.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.745
He's not allowed
to be a jerk to you.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.372
Well, he's not being a jerk.
He's just...

16:42.418 --> 16:45.000
(sighs) He's——
Don't ask him, okay?

16:45.046 --> 16:47.458
He's just feeling a little stupid.
It was nothing.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.498
Stupid about what?

16:50.551 --> 16:53.964
Stupid about taking a bunch
of painkillers on the stakeout,

16:54.013 --> 16:55.969
saying a bunch of stupid things.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.095
It's not a big deal.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.177
What are you talking about?

16:59.227 --> 17:00.433
It was funny, all right?

17:00.478 --> 17:02.218
He said some stuff.
He pledged his love.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.057
— It was ridiculous.
— His love?

17:04.106 --> 17:05.095
Foryou?

17:06.317 --> 17:08.273
lt——|t didn't mean anything.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.025
— (thumping)
— (woman) Come on, kids.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.107
(police radio chatter)

17:16.118 --> 17:17.654
Peck here.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.445
We found one of those
sticky little sweethearts.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.667
Saw an old pal of yours this morning.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.168
— Who?
— Donovan Boyd.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.830
(scoffs) What'd I do wrong this time?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.965
He's setting up a UC operation——

17:33.010 --> 17:35.467
cover apartment, new identity,
whole nine yards.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.003
Cover apartment, huh?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.262
This one is off the grid.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.514
Only contact is with Boyd
and the team.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.300
Yeah, for how long?

17:42.353 --> 17:44.344
Weeks, months, maybe longer.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.181
I go in three weeks.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.142
Wh——That's it? I mean,

17:51.195 --> 17:52.310
You're not even gonna think about it?

17:52.363 --> 17:53.603
What is there to think about?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.444
(Sam) Oh! Looks like
Christmas came early.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.332
Still warm.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.875
What, you think he ran out of gas?

18:17.555 --> 18:21.013
Uh, no. ljust think
he's your type of guy,

18:21.058 --> 18:22.389
man with a plan.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.096
Ha.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.681
There's only one camera out back,

18:25.730 --> 18:26.765
but it's wide—angle,

18:26.814 --> 18:30.352
so even though he parked
in a corner of the lot...

18:30.401 --> 18:31.811
we got him.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.147
Hey, Epstein, that's great.
Good work.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.276
So can you do that thingy
where you zoom in

18:35.323 --> 18:36.688
and you clean up the image?

18:36.741 --> 18:38.072
You know that doesn't
actually work, right?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.072
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.985
Here. Best I can do.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.245
Whitish—gray guy, medium build,

18:44.290 --> 18:45.826
with a blurry complexion.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.537
— (cell phone rings)
— Okay.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.167
(ring, beep)

18:50.212 --> 18:52.077
Sammy, Sammy, brother,
what's going on?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.541
Uh, well, we found the car.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.673
He ditched it over on Whitestone.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.879
Glove box is empty,
and the plates are gone.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.714
So no way to ID him.
That's smart.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.380
Yeah, my guess is either
he had a partner or a second car,

19:02.433 --> 19:05.266
— and he made the switch.
— Great. So we're back to zero.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.926
Sir, you should see this.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.892
Sammy, we got a bigger problem.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.693
Shooter's got a kid with him.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.199
(siren wailing)

19:22.244 --> 19:24.235
His name's Elliot Walker,
6 years old.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.496
He was at a birthday party
at Partytown Amusements.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.623
The short answer is, no,
we don't have a better picture.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.330
We're getting one
from the school database.

19:31.379 --> 19:34.041
The mother for the child
is on her way down here right now.

19:34.090 --> 19:37.127
Elliot was taken at 1447.
That's less than an hour ago.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.132
The bad news is
it's gonna get dark soon,

19:39.178 --> 19:40.543
so we gotta work fast.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.759
Worse, the bad guy ditched the car,
stripped the plates, the VlN,

19:43.808 --> 19:46.049
so we do not know who or what
we're looking for yet.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.592
Detective Barber is running with this.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.806
Any help he needs,
you give it to him.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.971
Mom's here.
She knows who took the kid.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.814
It's my ex, Vince.
lt's——|t's Elliot's father.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.445
He's been fighting me for custody
for the last year,

20:00.491 --> 20:01.947
but he is a drug addict.

20:01.992 --> 20:05.120
God, I don't want him
anywhere near my son.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.823
Elliot and l, we started again,
you know?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.032
And I have it all planned out.

20:08.082 --> 20:09.538
I just needed
a little bit more money.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.743
We're moving out east.
We're going to my——

20:10.793 --> 20:13.330
Any idea where
he might take your son?

20:13.379 --> 20:15.836
He was staying at a halfway house
in the East End.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.417
Um...Sunrise?

20:17.466 --> 20:19.206
He wouldn't have taken him there.
No, there's no way.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.842
— Not even Vince is that stupid.
— What about family?

20:21.887 --> 20:24.799
All of his family's still
in Collingwood, I think.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.090
Okay, Tammy,
does Vince have a record?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.974
Assault, possession.

20:29.019 --> 20:32.557
(Tammy) The court told me
it was safe to let him see my son.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.858
Robbery makes sense now.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.686
Yeah, parental abduction,

20:36.736 --> 20:38.101
and dad's taking off with the kid,

20:38.154 --> 20:39.985
needed cash for the trip.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.611
When the dad's got a record and he's armed,

20:41.657 --> 20:42.817
is that enough for an AMBER Alert?

20:43.868 --> 20:45.449
You know, let me get on the horn

20:45.494 --> 20:47.871
with, uh, Collingwood PD
and the OPP to cover the freeways.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.700
Yeah, I'll get our people to do spot checks
on all the other routes out of the city.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.830
Very good.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.456
One chicken suit, returned.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.666
Now you know what to wear
Saturday night.

20:58.716 --> 21:02.208
Afraid we have to keep the head
for evidence. Sign here.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.059
lt true the same guy that shot me
is the one who took the kid?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.184
Looks like.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.515
But it's his father, right?

21:14.565 --> 21:16.396
So the kid's not in danger or anything?

21:18.736 --> 21:21.523
We hope not, but he does
have a history of violence.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.571
And he did shoot you.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.732
You remember that, bird boy?

21:27.745 --> 21:29.701
That's the kid's mom over there?

21:29.747 --> 21:31.408
Yeah, that's her.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.449
She's terrified she's never
gonna see her son again...

21:34.502 --> 21:35.867
unless we get a lead.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.749
(Tammy) So what——
what happened...

21:38.798 --> 21:40.208
Traci...

21:40.257 --> 21:42.213
This is form B11.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.296
You were supposed
to fill out form B14.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.928
— (mouths words)
— B14?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.804
— Yeah.
— Right. That one is much longer.

21:49.850 --> 21:53.308
I'm sorry, Ricky, but we're gonna have
to ask you a few more questions,

21:53.354 --> 21:54.890
a lot more.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.681
(Sam) As far as anyone's concerned,
it's a standard seat belt check.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.815
Wave 'em in.
Get an eyeball on the driver.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.192
We don't know what he's driving,
so we gotta check everybody.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.444
(Andy) All right.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.229
— Hi.
— (man) Hello.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.443
Okay, go ahead. Thank you.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.776
So this undercover operation with Boyd,

22:10.830 --> 22:12.115
I mean, is it dangerous?

22:12.164 --> 22:15.201
Well, they don't usually do deep cover
on people with parking tickets,

22:15.251 --> 22:16.661
unless you got a lot of 'em.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.325
Then it's a joint meter maid/ETF thing.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.586
Why? You want to come with me?

22:20.631 --> 22:22.041
Just thought maybe
you could use the backup.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.376
I heard last time
you were in deep cover,

22:23.425 --> 22:25.586
you got chased down
and tackled by a girl.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.846
Overeager rookie.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.721
Didn't want to make her look bad
on her first day.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.176
— Hi.
— (woman) What happened?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.182
— All right, you can go.
— Folks, how you doing?

22:34.228 --> 22:36.514
Got your seat belt on there?
Seat belt?

22:36.564 --> 22:39.271
So what's Frank think about this?

22:39.316 --> 22:40.977
I haven't told him yet.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.733
Oh, really are a team player.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.191
What, was I supposed to check
with you before I said yes?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.276
You got your 5—, 10—, 20—, 50—year plan.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.701
That works for you.
I'm the opposite.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.449
Opportunity comes along——
I want it, I take it.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.826
Simple as that.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.705
Oh, well, congratulations
on being so simple.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.290
Thank you.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.086
— Hi.
— Hi. Something wrong, officer?

23:03.132 --> 23:05.373
Not for you.
Have a good day.

23:05.426 --> 23:06.541
Okay, thanks.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.963
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No,no,no,no.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.723
It was just supposed to be a sip.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.349
lt's water.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.556
Water's good for you.
I don't drink enough water.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.722
You're not even supposed to have
anything to drink.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.106
You're not supposed to have
liquids before surgery.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.019
And how long have |——am I gonna
be in the hospital for?

23:26.071 --> 23:27.402
I don't know.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.944
Banjo.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.235
— What?
— My stupid cat.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.825
If I'm gonna be in the hospital,
I need someone to feed him.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.284
Okay. You want me
to call someone?

23:38.334 --> 23:41.451
My family's all out west.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.092
1754 Boswell.
I'm in the annex.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.219
There's a cupboard
to the right of the fridge.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.425
— His food's in there.
— Okay.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.723
Careful, okay?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.637
He's kind of a jerk sometimes.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.898
That's okay. I'm used to those.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.276
(siren wailing)

24:11.408 --> 24:12.909
I don't want to lose my job.

24:12.952 --> 24:16.945
You're a giant chicken
that germy kids punch for fun.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.160
Believe me, the fall from grace
will not be very far.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.245
If you know anything about
Elliot Walker being taken,

24:22.294 --> 24:24.159
— you have to tell us.
— No, I swear,

24:24.213 --> 24:25.578
I didn't know
that was gonna happen.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.496
But you knew something
was gonna happen, right?

24:27.549 --> 24:30.040
Look, if you tell us now,
we might be able to help you.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.585
OthenNise, it looks really bad for you.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.344
(sighs)

24:34.390 --> 24:36.096
This guy came in a few days ago,

24:36.141 --> 24:38.302
said his kid was gonna be
at a birthday party

24:40.437 --> 24:42.769
I mean, hejust wanted to talk to him
for a couple of minutes.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.397
He showed me a family photo,
so I knew he wasn't a perv.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.353
Oh, you think you could just
tell everything you need to know

24:47.403 --> 24:49.644
by looking at a photo?

24:49.697 --> 24:50.903
What did he need you for?

24:50.948 --> 24:54.406
To leave the back door open
so no one would see him coming in.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.407
He——He paid me 100 bucks.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.990
And then he robbed the office.
He shot you.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.620
Well, that's sounds like
a terrific plan, Ricky.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.657
He wasn't supposed to rob anything.

25:02.710 --> 25:03.825
I saw a guy in the office.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.789
I thought maybe someone got in
'cause I left the door unlocked.

25:06.839 --> 25:07.919
Guess I surprised him.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.375
But you didn't recognize him?

25:09.425 --> 25:11.882
I can't see anything
in that damn chicken head.

25:11.927 --> 25:15.010
Besides, you guys said
he took off in a red hatchback.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.762
Dude who came to see me
wasn't driving one of those.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.342
What was he driving?

25:21.395 --> 25:24.603
(police radio chatter)

25:24.648 --> 25:26.434
(Oliver) Okay.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.269
(Chris) Bye, sir.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.479
(Dov) That was Traci.
They got a lead on the car.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.485
They think he's driving a maroon SUV.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.522
All right. Okay.
Well, we're gettin' somewhere.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.691
SUV's one of the most common
cars on the road.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.609
Don't be a buzz—kill.
It's a lead.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.994
Now you ladies keep an eye out.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.372
I'm gonna go see if I can find
some bushes need watering.

25:43.417 --> 25:46.580
Um, pretty sure everything's
frozen this time of year.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.209
I'm going pee, Diaz.

25:48.255 --> 25:51.463
I'm gonna go pee in the bushes.
(chuckles)

25:55.220 --> 25:56.721
(sniffs)

25:59.850 --> 26:01.806
Do you like Gail?

26:01.852 --> 26:02.807
What?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.559
What happened on the stakeout?

26:04.605 --> 26:06.220
What did she say?

26:06.273 --> 26:08.355
Is it true?
You said you're in love with her.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.936
I don't know.
I was totally high.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.316
— Did you kiss her?
— No.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.986
Yes. |——

26:16.575 --> 26:18.031
Shut up, man.
Don't try and talk this thing down

26:18.077 --> 26:19.567
and laugh like everything's okay.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.576
I thought you two were
just finally gettin' along,

26:21.622 --> 26:23.988
with the frozen drinks
and the video games.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.908
But it makes sense now.
You were waiting for your opportunity.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.416
No, Chris,
I wouldn't do that to——

26:28.462 --> 26:30.498
Just shut up, Dov.
Just shut the hell up.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.338
(brakes squeal)

26:33.383 --> 26:35.294
(Chris) SUV, fits the description.

26:35.344 --> 26:39.462
1504, we got a maroon SUV
avoiding the checkpoint.

26:39.515 --> 26:42.507
(Dov) He just turned down Route 9,
headed in your direction.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.844
Copy that.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.304
Hold you position
in case he doubles back.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.343
We're on our way.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.810
We can't get more units.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.474
The fire on Lakeshore's got priority.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.018
They found him,

26:54.071 --> 26:56.562
Walker's SUV——
avoiding a checkpoint, Route 9.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.730
They're boxing him in.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.240
(siren wailing)

27:00.285 --> 27:02.492
(tires skid)

27:07.209 --> 27:08.449
(Sam) This is 1504.

27:08.502 --> 27:11.414
We got an 11—80.
Route 9, north of Exit 56.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.999
It's a car accident, major damage.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.380
Yeah, I know. I'll check it out.
You guys stay here.

27:15.425 --> 27:18.132
(Sam) 1504, shots fired.
Repeat, shots fired.

27:18.178 --> 27:21.341
Route 9, north of Exit 56.
Request immediate backup.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.221
What are you guys waiting for?
Let's go. Let's go.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.007
(dispatcher on radio)
...1504 has shots fired.

27:25.060 --> 27:28.598
Route 9, north of Exit 56.
Available units, please respond.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.512
(Leslie groaning)

27:30.566 --> 27:31.646
Oh, my God.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.399
Ma'am, you okay?

27:34.444 --> 27:35.650
I'm okay.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.279
(sirens wailing)

27:42.327 --> 27:43.316
(sirens stop)

27:49.001 --> 27:50.366
Walker's gone.

27:50.419 --> 27:51.704
Clipped another car
about a hundred yards back,

27:51.753 --> 27:53.459
blew his tires, and ditched it here.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.790
He shot at you?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.376
Cover fire when we pulled up.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.540
Gave himself a head start.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.003
Best I can tell,

27:59.052 --> 28:01.088
he and the kid went that—a—way
towards those woods.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.379
That was less than 10 minutes ago.
They can't be far.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.387
What about Andy?

28:04.433 --> 28:06.890
She's down the road
with a vic in the other car,

28:06.935 --> 28:08.391
keeping her stable
until medics arrive.

28:08.437 --> 28:09.847
(Sam) McNally, are you good?

28:09.897 --> 28:12.263
Copy. Yeah,
everything's under control.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.056
All right, let's go.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.849
(guns unholster)

28:16.862 --> 28:18.477
(birds squawking)

28:23.118 --> 28:25.575
Should we call ETF, wait for backup?

28:25.621 --> 28:27.111
We are backup.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.621
Walker probably just wants
to get away with his son,

28:29.666 --> 28:31.998
but he might be trying
to punish his ex.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.659
You think he could hurt the kid?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.248
It happens.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.252
Fresh tracks. Two sets.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.135
They're, uh——They're going
in different directions.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.671
Maybe they got separated.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.806
Maybe. All right, Diaz, Epstein,
you go that way.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.682
— Stay in radio contact.
— (Chris) Yes, sir.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.144
Chris...

28:57.194 --> 28:59.810
Trail splits. I'm going this way.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.026
(dispatcher on radio)
1504, Rig 16

29:07.079 --> 29:09.070
is five minutes out
from your location.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.828
Okay, that's the Fire Department.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.206
Okay? They're gonna
get you out of here.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.617
It's all right.
It's gonna be okay.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.706
Come on, Leslie.
Just stay with me, all right?

29:16.755 --> 29:20.247
Just, like, one more minute.
You're gonna be home soon,

29:20.300 --> 29:23.633
and I'm gonna be listening
to your songs on the radio.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.590
No, you won't. (sighs)

29:27.516 --> 29:30.132
I'm a waiter...

29:30.185 --> 29:32.096
waitress...

29:32.145 --> 29:34.682
server,
whatever you want to call it.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.188
Really? I mean...

29:37.234 --> 29:39.976
you've been writing music
and recording demos.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.564
Just a couple more months, right?

29:41.613 --> 29:43.604
(crying) Do you know how long
I've been saying that?

29:43.657 --> 29:48.321
"Not now. | just have to wait
until the plan's just right.

29:48.370 --> 29:51.112
Just a couple more songs.
Just a couple more tracks."

29:51.164 --> 29:53.746
That bottle of champagne
I told you about?

29:53.792 --> 29:56.033
I bought it six years ago.

29:56.086 --> 29:59.169
I mean, what the hell
have I been saving it for?

29:59.214 --> 30:01.079
Later.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.998
You'll drink it later.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.846
(sighs) Right.

30:09.182 --> 30:11.719
Um, no liquids before surgery, right?

30:16.648 --> 30:19.139
Come on, stay awake. Okay?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.274
There's no way Walker's getting
very far without a vehicle.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.944
Another two or three miles,
these woods meet the highway.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.362
He could carjack somebody.

30:33.415 --> 30:35.076
He's already
shot one person today.

30:35.125 --> 30:38.242
(birds chirping,
helicopter approaching)

30:38.295 --> 30:40.081
Epstein.
I think I found something.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.870
(Sam) 10—4.
We'll be right there.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.504
Epstein, what's your 20?

30:46.136 --> 30:48.047
You should've left me alone.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.474
Epstein, what's your 20?

30:51.516 --> 30:53.802
You don't want to do this.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.513
— (Chris) Don't move, Walker!
— This is not gonna go your way.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.598
Put it down!
Put the gun down now!

30:57.647 --> 30:59.933
— (Dov) Put the gun down.
— This is Diaz. We found Walker.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.360
— We have a 10—33.
— Shut up! Put the gun down!

31:02.402 --> 31:04.438
He can't do that, not as long as
you're pointing your gun at me.

31:04.488 --> 31:08.106
| just want to be with my son, okay?
I love him.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.194
| just want some time alone with him,
just the two of us.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.494
I'm only gonna ask you
one more time.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.276
Put the gun down,
or I will shoot you!

31:13.330 --> 31:16.447
(Oliver) Walker, it's over, all right?
Just put it down.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.661
Walker! We found Elliot!

31:18.710 --> 31:22.669
— Daddy! I want to go home!
— Elliot? Are you okay, buddy?

31:22.714 --> 31:26.298
He's fine. He just didn't want
to play the game anymore.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.297
Vincent, do your son a favor

31:29.346 --> 31:32.463
and show him you know how
to do the right thing.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.303
(Oliver) Put the gun down now,
and get on your knees!

31:35.352 --> 31:36.808
Slowly.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.309
Slowly.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.515
(Chris) Down. Down.
Give me your hands.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.560
Elliot, I'm sorry! Okay, buddy?
Daddy loves you!

31:48.407 --> 31:50.568
(Oliver) You're good. Let's get
this kid into the warm.

31:50.617 --> 31:51.857
Epstein.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.652
(engine crackling,
hissing and popping)

31:54.704 --> 31:57.537
Why does it smell
like a campfire in here?

32:00.085 --> 32:02.121
(Leslie coughing)

32:16.351 --> 32:18.888
We can't wait anymore.
I gotta get you out of here.

32:20.814 --> 32:22.805
I'm gonna get this
underneath you, okay,

32:22.858 --> 32:24.189
so we can make enough room

32:24.234 --> 32:25.849
so you can pull yourself
out of there.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.439
Leslie, I'm gonna need your help.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.070
(fire crackling)

32:32.159 --> 32:34.650
Just hold on. Just hold on.

32:34.703 --> 32:38.366
— (coughing) I can't breathe.
— It's okay. It's okay.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.996
— I can't breathe.
— Okay, Leslie.

32:40.041 --> 32:43.078
(Andy panting)
Come on. Okay.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.961
When I say, "Go,"
you have to pull yourself up

32:46.006 --> 32:49.749
no matter how much it hurts, okay?
All right. Okay.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.135
— (Leslie coughing)
— Okay.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.512
Hold on!

32:59.144 --> 33:00.133
— Aah!
— All right, go!

33:00.187 --> 33:02.223
— Go! Go, go, go!
- (gaerS)

33:02.272 --> 33:04.513
(panting) Okay. Come on.
Come on. Ready?

33:04.566 --> 33:05.931
Just grab——grab...

33:05.984 --> 33:09.101
Aah! (groaning)

33:09.154 --> 33:11.566
— Go!
- Aah!

33:11.615 --> 33:13.321
(panﬂng)

33:13.366 --> 33:15.857
All right. Okay?

33:15.911 --> 33:18.903
— (groaning)
— Okay. Okay.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.748
(both panting)

33:23.793 --> 33:24.919
Like I said...

33:25.962 --> 33:27.498
no problem.

33:35.555 --> 33:36.886
— (Sam) Shaw.
— What?

33:36.932 --> 33:38.468
— Take Elliot.
— All right, come here, Elliot.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.428
Go on.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.717
(Oliver) Hi, Elliot.
This is my friend Casey.

33:41.770 --> 33:44.728
(radio chatter)

33:45.398 --> 33:46.524
Andy!

33:47.776 --> 33:48.982
Andy!

33:50.695 --> 33:52.401
Sam!

33:52.447 --> 33:53.778
I'm okay.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.405
I got her out, like,
just before it went up.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.032
lfl had known the car
was gonna catch on fire——

33:58.078 --> 33:59.363
Ah, it's okay.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.868
Even the medic
said she's gonna be fine.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.155
— You should've radioed.
— You were miles out.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.744
And, you know, car was on fire.

34:04.793 --> 34:05.873
I had that whole thing to deal with.

34:05.919 --> 34:07.329
— Uh—huh.
— Did you get the boy?

34:07.379 --> 34:08.494
They found him, yeah.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.707
Good.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.701
Pretty intense out there, huh?

34:45.750 --> 34:47.536
Just glad it worked out.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.550
Chris...

34:57.596 --> 34:58.802
I'm sorry.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.054
Look, I don't want to talk right now.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.339
And I'm not gonna say
everything's okay

35:02.392 --> 35:05.054
just 'cause you almost died...
again.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.028
So it's that last button
right there, Elliot.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.901
— (click)
— And look.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.733
Isn't that cool? Watch this.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.819
(siren whooping)

35:20.869 --> 35:22.405
(laughs) Okay. Is that amazing?

35:22.454 --> 35:23.409
Now if you wanted it to——
Oh, here we go, little man.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.615
— (gasps) Hey, baby!
— Mommy!

35:24.664 --> 35:26.620
Hi, sweetheart!
Come here! Come here!

35:26.666 --> 35:28.657
Hi, baby! Hi, baby! Oh!

35:28.710 --> 35:30.450
Ohh! (sniffles)

35:30.503 --> 35:32.209
— (kisses) You okay?
— (Elliot) Yeah, I'm okay.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.041
You're okay. Okay.
You want to go home, baby?

35:34.090 --> 35:36.001
— Yes.
— Yeah?

35:36.051 --> 35:38.133
Let's go home, buddy. Oh!

35:38.178 --> 35:39.509
(Jerry) All right, let's get you home.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.051
Chris, wait up!

35:45.477 --> 35:46.512
What's wrong?

35:46.561 --> 35:48.142
What's wrong?

35:48.188 --> 35:49.724
You kissed my best friend.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.855
Whoa, Chris,
it was not even like that.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.231
What——You know what? Save it.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.891
'Cause I don't care
how high Dov was.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.651
I know you, Gail,
and I know there is no way

35:57.697 --> 35:59.608
you would let anyone
get close enough to do anything

35:59.658 --> 36:01.774
unless you wanted them to.

36:02.952 --> 36:03.941
I gotta go.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.575
(sighs)

36:07.624 --> 36:09.990
— (zips up bag)
— McNally.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.910
Hey. How's it goin'?
Hell of a day, huh?

36:12.962 --> 36:14.953
Hey, the hospital called.
They need your notes

36:15.006 --> 36:16.746
for the postmortem
on the woman in the car.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.755
What?

36:17.801 --> 36:19.962
Atkins? Leslie Atkins.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.093
Yeah. Leslie's alive.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.799
Seriously, she's fine.
I got her out in time.

36:23.848 --> 36:24.883
The medic said she'd be fine.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.762
She passed about 20 minutes ago.

36:27.811 --> 36:31.269
She had an embolism, got into
her bloodstream on impact,

36:31.314 --> 36:32.690
hit her lungs, and that was it.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.642
I got her out.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.732
I mean, she——she was fine.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.396
Uh...

36:41.449 --> 36:43.781
Hey, I'm sure that you did
everything you could.

36:43.827 --> 36:46.534
You couldn't have known.
It happens sometimes.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.740
You do what you can,
and it looks like you got 'em,

36:48.790 --> 36:51.156
and...then you don't.

36:52.335 --> 36:53.495
(whispers) Yeah.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.413
Um...

37:03.722 --> 37:04.928
Yeah.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.466
l——Can you tell Traci
l'll catch up with her later?

37:09.519 --> 37:11.680
Uh, where you going?

37:13.773 --> 37:16.355
I gotta go feed a jerky cat.

37:19.404 --> 37:20.484
(Banjo meows)

37:20.530 --> 37:22.566
Aw. Somebody's hungry.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.480
(continues meowing)

37:24.534 --> 37:25.819
(lock turns)

37:25.869 --> 37:27.530
Hi.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.991
Hi. Come here.

37:36.463 --> 37:37.543
(clatter)

38:36.022 --> 38:39.355
(Leslie on CD)
We all set? Okay.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.392
(guitar playing slow—tempo song)

38:52.080 --> 38:55.948
J‘ Well, he jumps in the taxi J‘

38:56.000 --> 38:58.537
J‘ For the sky J‘

38:58.586 --> 39:05.048
J‘ He's off to slay
some demon dragonfly J‘

39:05.093 --> 39:08.256
J‘ And he looks at me J‘

39:08.304 --> 39:11.922
J‘ That long last time J‘

39:11.975 --> 39:14.011
J‘ Turns away again J‘

39:14.060 --> 39:15.470
J‘ And | wave... J‘

39:15.520 --> 39:18.353
We did good tonight.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.184
Yeah, we did.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.315
I get it. I'd do the same

39:22.360 --> 39:24.976
if somebody tried to stop me
from seeing Leo.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.236
You'd shoot a guy in a chicken suit?

39:27.282 --> 39:29.022
(chuckles)

39:29.075 --> 39:31.236
Jerry...

39:31.286 --> 39:33.277
why are you selling your sports car?

39:33.329 --> 39:34.990
You love that thing.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.530
Ah, I was just thinking
it was the right time.

39:39.127 --> 39:42.711
I thought I'd get something, you know,
a little more family—friendly,

39:42.755 --> 39:45.417
few more doors,
an actual backseat.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.253
See, now that...

39:48.303 --> 39:51.466
J‘ ...of those gates of hell J‘

39:51.514 --> 39:53.425
— That is cool.
— J‘ I can tell J‘

39:53.474 --> 39:57.262
— J‘ How hard you're trying... J‘
— Yeah?

40:00.690 --> 40:03.306
(sighs) Sounds like you had
a pretty major night.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.066
Well, it's no ETF, but yeah.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.562
Hey, Gail.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.901
Where's, uh——Where's Chris?

40:10.950 --> 40:12.736
Um, he's out.

40:12.785 --> 40:15.401
J‘ Somewhere
on the steepest slope... J‘

40:15.455 --> 40:18.913
We had a talk, and, uh...
and then he left.

40:18.958 --> 40:22.291
J‘ Nobody's crying J‘

40:24.714 --> 40:27.171
| get the feeling
she doesn't really like me.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.832
— (door opens and closes)
— It's not you.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.468
— It's me.
— J‘ ...couple long years J‘

40:32.513 --> 40:34.799
J‘ Of me walking around J‘

40:34.849 --> 40:38.808
J‘ Around this trail of tears J‘

40:38.853 --> 40:41.435
J‘ Where the very loud voices J‘

40:41.481 --> 40:44.894
J‘ Of my own fears J‘

40:44.943 --> 40:48.435
J‘ And ringin' and ringin' J‘

40:48.488 --> 40:51.651
J‘ In my ears J‘

40:51.699 --> 40:54.907
J‘ Says that love is long gone J‘

40:54.953 --> 40:56.784
J‘ Every move I make J‘

40:56.829 --> 40:58.160
J‘ It is all wrong J‘

40:58.206 --> 41:01.369
J‘ Says you never gave
a damn for me J‘

41:01.417 --> 41:04.830
J‘ For anythin', for anyone... J‘

41:04.879 --> 41:06.710
(line rings)

41:06.756 --> 41:08.997
(voice mail) This is Sam.
Leave a message.

41:09.050 --> 41:12.918
Hey, uh, look, ljust
wanted to say that l——

41:12.971 --> 41:14.802
I know that I've got a plan,
you know?

41:14.847 --> 41:17.930
And it's a great one.
But screw it. Okay?

41:17.976 --> 41:20.262
Screw the plan,
because I don't want to save

41:20.311 --> 41:22.302
the good candy for later
anymore, you know?

41:22.355 --> 41:26.268
I want to drink the champagne
now, and——(sighs)

41:26.317 --> 41:28.399
Okay, you've got three weeks, right?

41:28.444 --> 41:32.437
So let's make 'em count,
starting tonight.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.900
I'm coming over.

41:33.950 --> 41:38.444
J‘ You are dreamin'
in a warm, soft bed J‘

41:38.496 --> 41:40.282
J‘ May the voices J‘

41:40.331 --> 41:42.447
— (alert chimes)
— J‘ Inside you J‘

41:42.500 --> 41:44.832
J‘ That fill you with dread J‘

41:44.877 --> 41:47.084
J‘ Make the sounds of a... J‘

41:47.130 --> 41:49.086
Okay, here's your new lifeline.

41:49.132 --> 41:51.669
You remember the drill, yeah?
No contact with anybody

41:51.718 --> 41:52.958
except for me and my team
from now on.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.467
Yeah, I got it.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.968
Okay, I'm gonna send somebody
over to your place

41:56.014 --> 41:58.551
to take care of it,
and you're all set.

41:58.599 --> 42:01.932
Sorry for the short notice,
but we had to move on this thing tonight.

42:01.978 --> 42:03.684
It's not like I had any big plans.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.391
J‘ | wish you well J‘

42:05.440 --> 42:06.395
Right.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.397
(engine starts)

42:08.443 --> 42:12.482
J‘ On your way to the wishing well J‘

42:12.530 --> 42:14.486
(siren wailing in distance)

42:14.532 --> 42:19.242
J‘ Swinging off of those gates of hell J‘

42:19.287 --> 42:22.745
J‘ And I can tell how hard... J‘
