00:07.240 --> 00:09.760
Behold the mighty cockroach.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.880
Believed to have originated
in the Silurian period...

00:15.960 --> 00:18.960
over 350 million years ago.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.680
They can be found in
every part of the world,

00:21.760 --> 00:24.760
from the tropics
to the arctic.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.080
There exists
4,000 known species,

00:28.160 --> 00:30.080
and in a year,

00:30.200 --> 00:35.320
a single female can produce
over half a million descendants.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.680
Radiation doesn't kill them.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.680
By evolutionary standards,

00:39.760 --> 00:42.320
they are nearly
flawless creatures,

00:42.400 --> 00:45.480
but creatures nevertheless.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.440
Possessing only
a simple nervous system,

00:48.520 --> 00:54.080
their behavior is dictated solely
by responses to environmental stimuli.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.400
Unlike us, they are
incapable of thought,

00:58.480 --> 01:02.280
of... self-illumination.

01:04.319 --> 01:08.160
Compared to the roach,
we are gods...

01:08.240 --> 01:11.080
and must therefore
act accordingly.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.040
Is it true if you decapitate them,
they continue to live,

01:19.120 --> 01:22.160
eventually dying
of starvation ?

01:22.240 --> 01:25.080
Look, buddy,
I just kill 'em.

Well, that's why
I called you.

you froze the insects to death.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.800
Freeze them ?
Where's the fun in that ?

01:39.920 --> 01:43.120
No, we got a new pesticide
that works like a fungus.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.680
It not only kills
the infected roach,

01:45.720 --> 01:47.680
but that roach then
spreads the disease...

01:47.720 --> 01:50.000
to every other roach
it comes into contact with.

I'd get away for the weekend.

was something up there, but...

as you are about it ?

04:45.080 --> 04:48.120
Mulder, I think the only thing
more fortuitous...

04:48.200 --> 04:50.520
than the emergence of life
on this planet is that,

an intelligence as complex

The very idea of
