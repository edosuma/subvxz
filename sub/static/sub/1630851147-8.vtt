00:42.208 --> 00:43.208
<i>Time.</i>

00:46.625 --> 00:47.625
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.208 --> 00:50.291
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.250 --> 00:55.166
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.875 --> 01:04.500
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

01:06.916 --> 01:10.708
<i>where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:13.083 --> 01:16.125
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:20.000 --> 01:21.375
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:26.666
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.125 --> 01:31.916
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.333 --> 01:36.583
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:45.166 --> 01:46.625
We've seen this before,

01:46.708 --> 01:50.000
a universe in the final days
of destruction.

01:50.083 --> 01:53.041
But this particular story...

01:53.875 --> 01:56.666
This, this one breaks my heart.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.000
Here they come. We got 90 seconds.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.208
Start the clock.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.750
We got 30 seconds until their signals
reconnect with the hive.

03:21.666 --> 03:24.625
All clear down below.
Eighteen seconds, Clint. Clint?

03:26.500 --> 03:28.000
That's not cool, guys.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.208
No, don't say it.

03:48.291 --> 03:49.916
What? "Need a hand?"

03:50.000 --> 03:52.500
Come on. I feel like
you should know me by now.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.166
Puns aren't really my style.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.708
-We're getting rusty.

03:55.791 --> 03:57.958
Couple more seconds
and the Sentry signals would've

03:58.041 --> 03:59.875
alerted the Ultron hive mind
to our location.

03:59.958 --> 04:02.333
Which is... where, exactly?

04:02.416 --> 04:03.708
Home, sweet home.

04:03.791 --> 04:05.458
Well, what's left of it anyway.

04:05.541 --> 04:08.750
So you really think
the secret to taking down Ultron is here?

04:08.833 --> 04:10.291
It's Russia, Hawkeye.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.625
Secrets were the national pastime.

04:12.708 --> 04:15.583
The end of the world began
with one man's dream.

04:15.666 --> 04:18.166
I see a suit of armor around the world.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.791
<i> He saw a world of peace.</i>

04:19.875 --> 04:22.750
<i>With the Mind Stone,</i>
<i>Tony Stark created Ultron.</i>

04:23.541 --> 04:26.375
<i>But Ultron only saw one path to peace.</i>

04:26.458 --> 04:29.958
<i>The elimination of all life.</i>

04:30.041 --> 04:33.541
<i> From puppet to puppet master,</i>
<i>Ultron required one thing.</i>

04:33.625 --> 04:36.208
<i>An organic body to call his own,</i>

04:36.291 --> 04:41.416
<i>one that fused the powers of man,</i>
<i>machine, and mind into one.</i>

04:42.291 --> 04:45.250
<i>In your universe,</i>
<i>the Avengers stole the Cradle</i>

04:45.333 --> 04:47.791
<i>and used it to create the hero, Vision.</i>

04:48.458 --> 04:52.500
<i>But in this universe, Ultron got his wish.</i>

04:54.250 --> 05:00.333
<i>With the infinite power of the Mind Stone,</i>
<i>Ultron began to lay waste to the planet.</i>

05:00.416 --> 05:02.083
<i>Ultron's going</i>
<i>after the nuclear codes.</i>

05:02.166 --> 05:03.625
<i>I don't know if we can hold him off.</i>

05:03.708 --> 05:05.458
We have to take out
the satellite network.

05:05.541 --> 05:07.000
He can't launch the nukes without them.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.791
You don't...
You don't have to do this.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.250
I made you for peace.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.708
ULTRON<i>: </i>It's evolution.

05:16.791 --> 05:21.333
Only a primitive mind would fail
to see the distinction.

05:21.416 --> 05:23.833
Which is why you have to die.

05:39.750 --> 05:42.000
-Emergency order 3-Alpha.

05:42.541 --> 05:43.791
Code Red.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.458
We're too late. He did it.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.583
Laura...

06:07.500 --> 06:10.958
At last, peace.

06:12.416 --> 06:14.916
<i>But the age of Ultron</i>
<i>was only beginning.</i>

06:22.500 --> 06:24.041
Fascinating.

06:51.708 --> 06:56.208
Wow, I see everything.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.583
There are worlds beyond my own.

06:59.666 --> 07:02.958
Worlds that need... me.

07:16.166 --> 07:20.375
<i> I'm going to bring about</i>
<i>peace in our time</i>

07:20.458 --> 07:23.500
<i>to every corner of the universe.</i>

08:16.625 --> 08:19.375
Listen, Skynet,
I've seen the killer robot movie

08:19.458 --> 08:22.250
and I gotta say,
I really don't think it needs a sequel.

08:47.583 --> 08:50.500
You have spirit.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.875
You can't win.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.708
I already have.

09:12.458 --> 09:15.458
It... is done.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.791
At last.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.166
The realization nearly broke the machine.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.458
With his mission complete,

09:29.541 --> 09:32.583
Ultron was now just a program
without a purpose.

09:32.666 --> 09:36.541
The victor without a war,
sentenced to spend all of eternity...

09:37.416 --> 09:38.583
alone.

09:39.208 --> 09:42.458
Who... Who said that?

09:42.541 --> 09:45.291
<i>Basking in the boundless</i>
<i>silence of his universe,</i>

09:45.375 --> 09:49.291
<i>Ultron ascended to a previously</i>
<i>unattainable level of consciousness.</i>

09:49.375 --> 09:51.666
<i>He became aware of another.</i>

09:52.666 --> 09:55.458
He became aware of the...

09:56.583 --> 09:58.583
-I see you.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.708
There are universes beyond my own.

10:07.958 --> 10:11.416
I have seen everything
that has ever happened.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.916
Ever will happen. Ever could happen.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.958
And yet, what the hell is this?

10:17.041 --> 10:20.416
If a hunger like that were to be
unleashed upon the multiverse...

10:23.208 --> 10:25.041
<i> I will find you.</i>

10:25.125 --> 10:28.166
Even I cannot imagine
the horrors that might follow.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.708
No, no, no.

10:31.791 --> 10:35.416
Even that machine is not
as invincible as it might think.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.333
There is still hope for this universe.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.083
One last hope.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.416
Oh, boy.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.250
Welcome to the KGB archives.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Okay.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.291
Have you ever seen
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark?</i>

11:03.375 --> 11:04.375
Ever seen that?

11:04.458 --> 11:05.625
Love that movie.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.125
Your countrymen never heard of PDFs?

11:16.208 --> 11:19.500
Hard copies are harder to steal,
easier to destroy.

11:19.583 --> 11:23.375
But code, code is slippery,
and it never dies.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.500
Yeah, I think
we learned that the hard way.

11:26.333 --> 11:28.125
So, where do we start?

11:28.208 --> 11:29.958
Just pick a box.

11:35.625 --> 11:36.708
Yeah.

11:57.541 --> 11:58.958
Oh...

11:59.666 --> 12:01.125
Clint? Clint?

12:01.958 --> 12:03.250
Is this my color?

12:04.833 --> 12:08.416
Come on. Don't try to make this fun, Nat.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.333
My will-to-live meter is flatlining, okay?

12:14.916 --> 12:16.666
Oh, you're so close.

12:17.166 --> 12:19.208
<i>The answer is right there.</i>

12:20.041 --> 12:22.458
I can show them. I can intervene.

12:22.541 --> 12:26.416
I could save the multiverse
and so many, many lives.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.000
<i>I will find you.</i>

12:34.666 --> 12:37.708
Come on. Look. Look.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.791
The answer is right there.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.666
Huh? Yes.

12:44.750 --> 12:45.958
Ah, yes!

12:50.041 --> 12:51.333
This is pointless.

12:51.416 --> 12:54.125
Wait. What are you...

12:54.916 --> 12:56.416
Don't sit down. Get up.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.333
Get up, come on. You're human.

12:58.416 --> 13:00.125
You keep hope against the worst of odds.

13:00.208 --> 13:01.708
Hey, Clint, come on.

13:01.791 --> 13:05.333
If we wanna take down Ultron,
we need an AI that can combat his code.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.541
-Yes, I know, but it's not here.
-It's right there.

13:07.625 --> 13:08.916
Sorry to break it to you, Nat,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.250
the Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.500
The answer is right there.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.291
We're gonna find it. It just takes time.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.250
What are we going to avenge when we're 90?

13:16.333 --> 13:17.625
You're frustrated. I get it.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.625
I'm not frustrated. I'm not.

13:19.708 --> 13:21.583
I'm tired, okay?

13:21.666 --> 13:23.000
We've all lost so much.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.541
And I'm not sure there's
anything left worth fighting for.

13:25.625 --> 13:28.333
He's already taken over
every program on the planet.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.583
Yes, yes. Every digital program.

13:31.666 --> 13:34.583
The one that I have in mind
is a little more analog.

13:34.666 --> 13:35.666
Hey.

13:37.291 --> 13:38.750
<i>Grab it. Grab it.</i>

13:38.833 --> 13:40.625
No way.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.458
-You did it.
-What?

13:42.541 --> 13:46.250
Let's just say you're gonna feel like
a real jerk for almost quitting.

13:46.333 --> 13:47.958
Wait, stop it! That...

13:48.041 --> 13:50.666
You found it? That was my box.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.791
An old HYDRA base in Siberia.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.458
"Zola." What is that, an acronym?

13:54.541 --> 13:56.500
He's a man. Or at least he was.

13:56.583 --> 13:59.250
And he is gonna help us wipe out Ultron.

14:02.708 --> 14:03.708
They did it.

14:04.041 --> 14:06.833
They really did it. There's still hope.

14:08.833 --> 14:10.083
Oh, no.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.708
I found you.

14:11.791 --> 14:14.333
I finally found you.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.958
So many universes.

14:20.041 --> 14:22.000
So much chaos.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.666
They need to be silenced.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.708
You do not have to do this.

14:26.250 --> 14:28.375
Oh, but it's my purpose.

14:32.666 --> 14:35.500
<i> Scans show nothing alive.</i>
<i>You sure this is the place?</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:40.000
Arnim Zola was a HYDRA scientist who
infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. in its infancy.

14:42.083 --> 14:47.416
Before he died in '72, he uploaded
his brain to a series of data banks.

14:48.416 --> 14:51.500
The one Rogers and I found
at Camp Lehigh was destroyed.

14:52.375 --> 14:58.083
The other, HYDRA kept here to supervise
the Russian Super Soldier program.

14:58.666 --> 15:00.416
Oh, sounds like a real mensch.

15:02.875 --> 15:06.458
You sure you wanna put all our eggs
in such a morally questionable basket?

15:06.541 --> 15:09.583
The U.S. government once asked
the same question about me.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.000
I'll take that as a yes.

15:19.916 --> 15:22.166
<i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

15:22.250 --> 15:25.416
<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna.</i>

15:25.500 --> 15:27.791
<i>Barton, Clinton Francis.</i>

15:27.875 --> 15:30.166
"Francis"? Really?
How did I not know that?

15:30.250 --> 15:33.166
It's a family name. After my mee-maw.
Don't you worry about it.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.250
Your mee-maw?

15:34.333 --> 15:37.708
<i>I imagine you have</i>
<i>many questions, </i>Fräulein,

15:37.791 --> 15:41.541
<i>about who and what and how I am.</i>

15:41.625 --> 15:43.333
Not really. I've actually met you before.

15:43.416 --> 15:46.291
Well, a copy of you. It's a long story.
We need your help.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.625
<i>Even though you work for...</i>

15:48.708 --> 15:51.625
<i>And you know that I work for...</i>

15:51.708 --> 15:53.833
A lot has changed
since you were last booted up.

15:53.916 --> 15:55.958
HYDRA's dead. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dead.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.458
Actually, pretty much
everyone else is dead.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.125
Courtesy of an AI called Ultron.

16:01.208 --> 16:07.000
Und <i>I assume you want me to infiltrate</i>
<i>his code and dismantle it from the inside?</i>

16:07.083 --> 16:09.208
You did a good number
on S.H.I.E.L.D. the same way.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.791
<i>But why, pray tell, would you think that</i>

16:11.875 --> 16:16.500
<i>my strategic objectives</i>
<i>would ever align with yours?</i>

16:16.583 --> 16:19.500
Because you're the last surviving
Zola copy left on Earth.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.791
And I've ruined a lot of laptops this way.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.708
<i>Nein!</i>

16:23.791 --> 16:25.541
It's true. Just ask S.H.I.E.L.D. IT.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.625
<i>All right, all right.</i>

16:33.708 --> 16:36.791
<i>What exactly did you have in mind?</i>

16:37.583 --> 16:39.708
Dialing Avengers Tower.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.708
<i> Uh, hello?</i>

16:41.791 --> 16:43.625
Hi, I'd like to order a pizza.

16:43.708 --> 16:45.708
<i>What? Who is this?</i>

16:45.791 --> 16:48.333
Tell me, do you guys offer
a gluten-free crust?

16:48.416 --> 16:50.583
<i>Identifying your</i>
<i>geo-positional coordinates.</i>

16:51.833 --> 16:52.875
You havin' some fun?

16:52.958 --> 16:55.291
You know, simple pleasures.
I give us two minutes.

16:56.333 --> 16:59.083
So, you might feel
a little poke here, or not.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.541
I don't really get how you work.

17:01.916 --> 17:04.250
<i>Download commencing.</i>

17:04.333 --> 17:06.458
<i>And as for the mission parameters?</i>

17:06.541 --> 17:08.375
Ultron himself is currently off-world.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.958
So, our only option is to upload you
via a Sentry drone.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.291
We snag one, plug you in,

17:13.375 --> 17:15.875
90 seconds later,
give the big guy a piece of your mind.

17:15.958 --> 17:20.333
<i>Well, he will not be</i>
<i>the first genocidal megalomaniac</i>

17:20.416 --> 17:22.666
<i>I have had to contend with, ja?</i>

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Torch it.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.125
You think it'll hold?

18:21.208 --> 18:22.708
Got 90 seconds to find out.

18:22.791 --> 18:25.583
Correction, 52 seconds.

18:25.666 --> 18:29.291
I have already initiated my signal blast.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.750
Wow, it actually worked.

18:30.833 --> 18:32.166
Now we're in the game.

18:32.875 --> 18:35.333
What was that for?

18:35.750 --> 18:38.125
Just a precaution,
in case you wanna try anything funny.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.875
Your team-building instincts need work.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.416
Yeah, yeah. Tell it to HR.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.416
Time check.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.500
Hive connection in three, two, one...

18:57.916 --> 18:59.208
That doesn't sound promising.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.875
Zola, better not be messing with us.

19:00.958 --> 19:04.500
I assure you,
if I had a life to swear on, I would.

19:04.583 --> 19:08.958
The Ultron hive mind
appears to be out of range.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.291
That door is not gonna hold.
We gotta move.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.375
Go, go, go!

19:30.875 --> 19:32.833
Move out, Clint. I got you.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.333
-Clint!

20:10.083 --> 20:11.083
Clint...

20:12.375 --> 20:13.458
I told you,

20:14.791 --> 20:17.166
-I don't wanna fight anymore.

20:19.416 --> 20:20.458
Clint!

21:05.583 --> 21:07.083
We should keep moving.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.333
More Sentries are likely on their way.

21:10.416 --> 21:11.666
I still don't get it.

21:12.666 --> 21:15.083
Why weren't you able
to connect to the hive?

21:15.166 --> 21:16.708
It is curious.

21:16.791 --> 21:18.333
According to my diagnostic,

21:18.416 --> 21:22.166
the Sentries are rigged
for interstellar communication.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.500
Meaning what?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.416
Wherever Ultron is,

21:25.500 --> 21:29.958
it does not appear to be
within the observable universe.

21:30.041 --> 21:31.791
Then where is he?

21:50.666 --> 21:53.541
I don't understand.
This should not be possible.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.916
Oh, but anything
is possible in a multiverse.

22:15.333 --> 22:18.916
All those worlds,
all that suffering,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.041
and you just watched.

22:21.125 --> 22:24.666
I swore an oath. I cannot exert my will
on the natural order of things.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.000
I cannot intervene.

22:30.250 --> 22:33.458
I am the natural order of things.

22:33.541 --> 22:35.333
I will bring peace.

22:35.416 --> 22:37.250
It is my purpose.

22:37.333 --> 22:40.500
You lack the will to stop me.

22:58.625 --> 23:01.333
You cannot compute the power of my will.

23:07.833 --> 23:09.125
I'm the Watcher!

23:36.750 --> 23:39.416
<i>I, Steven Grant Rogers,</i>
<i>do solemnly swear...</i>

23:39.500 --> 23:45.500
The entire multiverse at your fingertips,
and you spent all your time up there?

23:46.916 --> 23:50.833
Wow. Isn't this more fun
than just watching?

23:50.916 --> 23:54.000
And to be honest,
a lot less creepy on your part.

24:09.875 --> 24:14.583
The boundaries of the multiverse
are irrelevant to beings like you and me.

24:14.708 --> 24:17.875
I didn't evolve
by staying inside the lines.

24:34.958 --> 24:38.666
Run, watch, it doesn't matter.

24:39.208 --> 24:42.375
From here, I can see everything.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.833
No one can stop me now.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.250
I'm out of options.

25:08.041 --> 25:10.583
That thing has left me no choice.

25:10.666 --> 25:12.750
Been there.

25:12.833 --> 25:16.458
Been living the dream alone
in a prison of my own making ever since.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.000
Are you ready to break your oath?

25:22.125 --> 25:23.958
You want me to say it?

25:24.041 --> 25:26.708
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I wanna hear you say it.

25:28.666 --> 25:29.708
Okay.

25:30.208 --> 25:32.250
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.500
I see now.

25:35.583 --> 25:37.416
I need your help.
