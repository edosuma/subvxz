01:07.600 --> 01:10.000
<i>In America we have laws.</i>

01:11.400 --> 01:15.500
<i>Laws against killing.
Laws against stealing.</i>

01:16.700 --> 01:21.700
<i>It's accepted that, as a member of
society, you will live by these laws.</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:27.900
<i>In West Canaan, Texas, there's
another society that has its own laws.</i>

01:34.600 --> 01:37.100
<i>Football is a way of life.</i>

01:40.000 --> 01:43.200
<i>That's me as a kid,
playing ball with my best friends.</i>

01:43.500 --> 01:47.500
<i>I'm Jonathan Moxon,
but most people call me Mox.</i>

01:54.400 --> 01:58.800
<i>As a boy in West Canaan, you never
question the sanctity of football.</i>

01:59.400 --> 02:04.200
<i>You just listened to the coaches
and tried as best you could to win.</i>

02:05.300 --> 02:07.700
<i>Win at all costs.</i>

02:17.700 --> 02:22.500
<i>Good morning, Creighton Miles here,
looking forward to seeing you tonight</i>

02:22.900 --> 02:27.700
<i>at Bud Kilmer stadium as the
Coyotes take on the Bingville Bulls...</i>

02:28.700 --> 02:31.600
- Think you'll play tonight ?
- Do I ever ?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.700
Lance is the best quarterback
in the state.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.900
Maybe if you run up the score...
What if Lance gets hurt ?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.700
That would be a disaster.

02:43.500 --> 02:48.500
<i>As a man on the cross,
pray for the health of Lance Harbor.</i>

02:54.500 --> 03:00.300
- Son, did you pray for playing time ?
- Yeah, I just spoke to Jesus upstairs.

03:00.800 --> 03:05.700
- The crucified 11-year-old in my room.
- Is Kyle strapped to that cross again ?

03:06.200 --> 03:08.500
Kyle... ! Why is he so difficult ?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.100
What is it with the cross ?

03:12.500 --> 03:16.200
- I'm preparing to die for man's sins.
- That's so sweet.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.700
I want it off now. How is your brother
supposed to concentrate on the game

03:23.100 --> 03:26.500
when you've got this whole deal
strapped to your back ?

03:26.900 --> 03:29.600
- He's just experimenting.
- I'm serious.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
- We need to concentrate on the game.
- That's probably Billy Bob.

03:38.400 --> 03:43.200
Hey Mox, you skinny-assed bitch !
Let's roll !

03:49.500 --> 03:55.200
Come on, man. Get in the truck.
Let's go. Earn it ! You got it !

03:56.900 --> 03:59.400
You're almost there !
Here we go !

04:04.800 --> 04:10.100
- You tell him, Bacon.
- Bacon, off in the flatbed.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.000
If this swine fucks up my new suit,
he's road ham !

04:17.300 --> 04:20.800
I'm sorry, Wendell.
Just kick him off.

04:21.300 --> 04:25.100
I'm gonna toss your pig ass
out on the street.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.800
- I love that dog.
- I think it's a pig.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.600
I love you, brother.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.800
I had the most beautiful dream
last night.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.100
If you need anything,
you let me know.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.700
Tweeder, let's go !

05:19.500 --> 05:22.800
Come on, just jump on !

05:26.900 --> 05:29.500
<i>Good mooning, boys.</i>

05:31.400 --> 05:34.900
<i>I've been up since the crack of dawn
and I have to ass you a question.</i>

05:35.300 --> 05:39.600
- What is up with Carrie-Anne Baker ?
- Darcy's friend ?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.400
Oh, my God ! She's got this look !

05:42.800 --> 05:47.100
That "I wanna suck your dick" look.

05:47.500 --> 05:51.800
- Relax, man, you've got to focus.
- I can't focus. I need to get some ass !

05:52.200 --> 05:54.900
I need to get some ass.

05:55.200 --> 06:00.400
I'm about to fuck your pig !
Give me a kiss.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.400
Tonight we play Bingville.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.600
Tonight we beat Bingville !

07:19.800 --> 07:23.700
In my 30 years of coaching
at West Canaan,

07:24.200 --> 07:27.100
I have brought two state titles

07:27.500 --> 07:30.600
and 22 district championships.
Count them !

07:37.800 --> 07:41.400
And this year,
with your support for this great team,

07:41.800 --> 07:47.200
I will bring number 23.
Go, Pack ! Go, Pack !

07:54.200 --> 07:59.400
Now I present to you our captain,
Lance Harbor. Let's hear it !

08:07.600 --> 08:09.700
- Hi.
- How are you.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.300
I swear Kilmer gets off on this.
He's made your brother a god.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.300
I was lying in bed last night...

08:21.300 --> 08:27.300
I drifted off and had a dream
we were beating Bingville 14-3.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.799
But I woke up kind of sad.

08:36.100 --> 08:41.600
But then I realised it was only a dream.
We'll beat Bingville by more than that.

08:49.100 --> 08:53.100
- This insanity's over in a few weeks.
- Five more games.

08:53.400 --> 08:58.600
No more football, no more Kilmer. If
I get into Brown, no more West Canaan.

08:59.100 --> 09:03.600
- No more games on Friday nights.
- You don't like games on Friday ?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.700
- I like trains better.
- Really...

09:08.100 --> 09:11.100
- You wanna watch trains tonight ?
- Sure.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.800
<i>This is Creighton Miles,
the voice of West Canaan football.</i>

09:18.100 --> 09:22.800
<i>The Coyotes play the Bingville Bulls,
as they try to stay undefeated.</i>

09:23.300 --> 09:28.800
Joining me is Stubby "Stud-Daddy"
Tanner, former defensive great.

09:29.300 --> 09:33.600
- You have a few words for the folks ?
- Just one thing for Bingville fans.

09:34.100 --> 09:38.800
Tell granny to move, the Coyotes
are coming to burn her house down.

09:39.600 --> 09:44.600
Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I'll not fear Bingville.

09:49.700 --> 09:53.700
Stay loose, Mox. You never know
when Kilmer might play you.

09:55.600 --> 10:00.500
<i>Bingville don't stand no chance
and Bingville can't see my dance.</i>

10:00.900 --> 10:04.200
You wanna see
the new Tweeder end zone dance ?

10:06.400 --> 10:10.800
You know what it's called ?
The new Tweeder end zone dance.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.900
Stick...

10:53.800 --> 10:57.300
What a night Lance Harbor's had !

11:40.200 --> 11:44.900
Sammy, that's about the most action
your boy's seen, ain't it ?

11:45.300 --> 11:48.200
The Coyotes are punching it in for six.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.600
Billy Bob...

12:20.900 --> 12:23.000
Trainer !

12:36.300 --> 12:39.800
- Did we score ?
- Yeah, we got the six.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.000
How many fingers ?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.200
Three.

12:45.500 --> 12:50.900
It's got to be true/false. Billy Bob, he's
holding up some fingers, true or false ?

12:51.400 --> 12:54.500
- True ?
- He's all right.

13:22.900 --> 13:27.000
If your daddy hadn't played
his heart out for me, I'd cut your ass.

13:32.700 --> 13:36.100
That was a good game tonight.
Good pass, Bo.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.900
Johnny and Robert, defence
in third quarter, excellent effort.

13:41.300 --> 13:45.900
Game ball goes to,
surprise, surprise, Lance Harbor.

13:53.800 --> 13:58.900
Get yourself another shelf.
Pretty good running the ball, Wendell.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.700
- How are you feeling ?
- Dog tired. It's my knee.

14:04.100 --> 14:09.300
Never show weakness. The only pain
that matters is the pain you inflict.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.900
Look at Billy Bob.
He's got enough heart for all of you.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.700
Four more games.

14:21.700 --> 14:24.700
Hang in there, you're doing fine.

14:25.100 --> 14:29.000
Tweeder, you got any ?
My knee's killing me.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.800
- 500 mg. How many can I have ?
- Keep them.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.600
I got more at home.

14:38.900 --> 14:43.800
We need more effort. What is this shit ?
I'm not interested in your muscles !

14:44.700 --> 14:49.800
Kilmer...
What a fucking asshole, huh ?

14:52.500 --> 14:56.800
I'm getting fucked-up tonight.

15:03.900 --> 15:09.300
There you go. Chug it. What do
you mean, is he a boy or a girl ?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.600
Look at the size of that sausage !

15:15.000 --> 15:20.500
I just got so excited about next year,
Florida State and the future...

15:20.900 --> 15:23.700
I think I need to be your wide receiver.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.300
- Really, babe ? Here ?
- Not <i>here</i> here.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.700
But somewhere here.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.800
- How come you never dress like that ?
- It costs a lot to look that cheap.

15:42.200 --> 15:46.300
- She's pretty sharp. She pulls A's.
- That's not all she pulls.

15:46.700 --> 15:50.800
- I'm just saying she's not stupid.
- You shut up.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.900
<i>She broke my heart
so I broke her jaw...</i>

15:56.400 --> 15:59.700
- When did you graduate ?
- I'm class of 1980.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.600
- He's class of 1980.
- And you still come to these parties ?

16:08.000 --> 16:13.400
- I never miss these.
- That's team spirit.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.300
Are you ready to be on
"America's Hilarious Home Videos" ?

16:18.700 --> 16:22.600
- Absolutely.
- All right. Put down that glass.

16:23.100 --> 16:25.900
Pick up that there flower pot.

16:26.700 --> 16:31.000
Bring it up over your head.
Now close your eyes.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.500
Think real hard...
You getting this ?

16:35.900 --> 16:39.400
Say, "I'm stupid and I'm about
to get hit in the nuts."

16:42.100 --> 16:44.300
- That's funny.
- Ain't it ?

16:44.600 --> 16:49.300
They need to change the name to
"America's Funniest Shots in the Nuts".

16:53.900 --> 16:58.200
- I don't know if I can concentrate here.
- Relax...

16:59.700 --> 17:02.200
Let the dryer do the work.

17:17.500 --> 17:22.000
All right, fancy boy,
you ready to show us your dinner ?

17:28.700 --> 17:30.000
Nothing but net.

17:53.700 --> 17:57.500
You thinking about
calling some dinosaurs ?

17:57.800 --> 18:01.100
I figured I'd give them...

18:03.600 --> 18:05.500
...a holler.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.300
Billy Bob's gonna puke.

18:37.300 --> 18:42.100
Hey, if you're hungry,
I left a few hot dogs in here.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.100
I'm back ! Puke and rally !

19:06.000 --> 19:10.700
That's the way to ride them.
First-string offence, take water.

19:11.900 --> 19:16.400
Dummios, follow your dummy QB
for a scrimmage.

19:18.200 --> 19:23.000
Moxon, pick it up !
Your attitude's earning you laps, boy.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.000
Keep smiling, shithead.

19:29.400 --> 19:33.400
He used to hammer my ass
the same way 27 years ago.

19:34.100 --> 19:39.400
- Hell, it's good for them.
- They're having the time of their lives.

19:39.900 --> 19:43.600
- Oop-dee-oop left, on one.
- Let's go, big Mox !

19:44.100 --> 19:46.000
Shift !

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
What the hell kind of offence is that ?
Kilmer's gonna eat his ass.

19:55.800 --> 20:00.800
- Jesus, Moxon, what are you doing ?
- It's a secret.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.900
Your dummies can't run a simple draw,
and you got secret formations ?

20:06.400 --> 20:10.700
- This ain't no fucking sandlot.
- It's called an Oop-dee-oop.

20:11.100 --> 20:16.500
Overload the defense on one side,
burn them one-on-one on the other.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.800
You got a bad attitude
and you don't listen !

20:22.300 --> 20:27.800
We do things around here my way !
You think you're in some fancy school ?

20:28.200 --> 20:33.400
I wonder if you know the difference
between a sneeze and a wet fart !

20:33.800 --> 20:39.500
- You'll be second-string all your life !
- Kilmer loves to bang on your boy.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.200
- Been on him all season.
- Oop-dee-oop, give me a break !

20:45.600 --> 20:49.200
I stood up to it, so will he.

21:02.700 --> 21:08.100
We're holding our Troy back a year,
so he'll be bigger for frosh tryouts.

21:09.100 --> 21:14.300
- Eighth grade ain't so bad, is it ?
- Our Kyle's dying to be a Coyote.

21:14.700 --> 21:19.100
Had that ankle injury, but he's ready
to go now. Ain't that right, son ?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.300
Kyle ?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.500
Kyle !

21:26.400 --> 21:28.400
He's very spiritual.

21:29.700 --> 21:34.700
It's a shame nobody had the mind
to hold us back when we was kids.

21:35.100 --> 21:38.300
Hell, I didn't fare so bad.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.100
Lance ! Toss me one, son.

21:44.400 --> 21:50.200
Let's show them your old pop's still
got it. Button hook right, on three !

21:56.100 --> 22:00.000
- Slow enough he could've mailed it.
- Well, there you go, Sammy boy.

22:01.100 --> 22:04.300
- Let's see it.
- Let's show them how it's done.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.000
Dad, you're gonna fall in the barbecue.

22:07.300 --> 22:11.700
Slant right, on three.
Don't talk back to your father.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.300
Hit it !

22:22.600 --> 22:26.900
- I guess bad hands run in the family.
- What's that supposed to mean ?

22:27.300 --> 22:30.100
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.300
If Kilmer weren't such a prick,
my boy would be starting quarterback.

22:37.100 --> 22:41.300
Is that a fact ?
And you think he's first-string ?

22:41.700 --> 22:45.100
- That's right.
- I smell a challenge.

22:47.400 --> 22:52.000
How about you, Johnny ?
You think you're better than my boy ?

22:54.600 --> 22:59.400
Hell, it ain't multiple choice.
Let's settle this once and for all.

22:59.800 --> 23:05.200
You all remember William Tell. Let's
show them what it takes to be a starter.

23:05.800 --> 23:11.000
- Stop it, Dad. This isn't funny.
- Show them what you're made of.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.300
Nail it, Lance !

23:17.300 --> 23:22.000
- You're up, Sammy boy.
- Dad, come on, this is stupid.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.400
Throw it.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.900
- Sporting some 'tude now !
- Be a winner, throw the ball !

23:30.300 --> 23:34.000
- You can do it !
- Sit on the bench !

23:34.300 --> 23:37.800
- Show us what you do best !
- He's chicken !

23:41.200 --> 23:45.200
- Throw that damn ball !
- You feel like chicken tonight ?

23:47.600 --> 23:53.100
I raised you to be a winner, so win !
Fire that fucking pigskin.

23:58.300 --> 24:03.200
- Nice shot !
- Not ice, get him a beer.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.800
Oh, my God.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.000
Ladies and gentlemen...

24:40.500 --> 24:43.500
We are adults.

24:43.900 --> 24:49.700
I think it's necessary we move beyond
the common nomenclature

24:50.100 --> 24:55.400
commonly associated
with sexual reproduction.

24:56.400 --> 25:01.100
Now, I want everybody together
to go ahead and say :

25:02.400 --> 25:06.000
Penis, penis, penis.
Vagina, vagina, vagina.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.400
Come on, y'all, say it.

25:14.600 --> 25:19.200
Penis, penis, penis.
Vagina, vagina, vagina.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.900
Good !

25:24.200 --> 25:29.700
I think it's also very important
that we discuss, and discard,

25:30.200 --> 25:35.800
any slang terms
for different sex organs... Please.

25:36.300 --> 25:41.200
Because today we are going to begin
our study of...

25:42.900 --> 25:45.600
...the male erection.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.500
Hand down, Billy Bob.

25:50.300 --> 25:54.800
What are a few slang expressions
for the male erection

25:55.200 --> 25:58.100
we want to identify and discard ?

26:00.600 --> 26:04.700
- Elliot ?
- "Boner" ?

26:06.100 --> 26:11.300
- Is boner one of them ?
- Yes, boner is good...

26:11.800 --> 26:19.100
- Boner is... What, Billy Bob ?
- Can I go to the bathroom ?

26:20.800 --> 26:25.000
Does anybody have any others
before we move on ?

26:26.500 --> 26:30.500
Mr Moxon,
will you share with us ?

26:30.900 --> 26:35.900
The male erection ?
Pitching a tent, sporting a wood.

26:36.300 --> 26:41.400
Icicles formed. The march is on.
Stiffy. Mr Mortis.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.600
Rigor mortis has set in. Flesh rocket.
Jack's magic beanstalk.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.900
Tall Tommy. Mushroom on a stick.
Purple-headed yoghurt-slinger.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.800
And... Pedro.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.400
Pedro ?

27:16.800 --> 27:20.200
- Billy Bob, are you okay ?
- Yes, ma'am.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.400
Call the nurse.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.600
Go on now.

27:35.800 --> 27:39.800
- How are you feeling, son ?
- I can't hold down any chow.

27:40.200 --> 27:45.700
Must be nerves. Don't you worry.
You'll play every minute of that game.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.200
The nurse doesn't think I should play.

27:50.500 --> 27:55.000
- Oh, she doesn't, does she ?
- 'Cause I whacked my head last week.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.400
She don't have
no division title to win.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.100
I'm gonna ask you, son...

28:03.200 --> 28:05.500
Are you ready to go ?

28:09.200 --> 28:15.100
- Yes, sir.
- That's my soldier. See you at practice.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.300
Yes, sir.

28:32.200 --> 28:36.400
Fourth down, 1:49 to play.
Greenville leading 21-17.

28:37.100 --> 28:42.300
<i>If they hope to win the ball game,
they've got to stop Greenville here.</i>

28:49.600 --> 28:56.500
<i>Hornets come to the line of scrimmage.
And Terry's stopped in his tracks !</i>

28:58.100 --> 29:00.400
Our ball ! We got the bastards !

29:00.700 --> 29:06.000
It's ours to win now. Get out
and win this ball game. 4-95, go !

29:06.400 --> 29:09.700
- Come on, Lance !
- Let's go !

29:10.100 --> 29:14.200
Billy Bob, I need you
for one more series. Get in there.

29:14.600 --> 29:18.400
Are you all right to play ?
If you're not, say something.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.300
Moxon, get your ass on that bench !

29:23.300 --> 29:28.700
Let's go, boys. It's ours to win.
Door's open, let's go !

30:06.600 --> 30:09.200
Lord, don't do this to me.

30:14.900 --> 30:19.200
<i>Stub, I've hardly ever
heard this stadium this quiet.</i>

30:19.700 --> 30:22.300
Lance Harbor laying there...

30:22.700 --> 30:25.700
<i>Can you see his future
going down the drain ?</i>

30:26.000 --> 30:29.800
<i>And what must this do
to the Coyotes'football plans ?</i>

30:42.700 --> 30:45.600
Please be okay, Lance !

30:54.500 --> 30:56.700
I'm sorry, man.

31:05.800 --> 31:11.900
- Now you've got Moxon coming in.
- You've taken more snaps than him.

31:17.700 --> 31:22.000
Let's go.
We've got a game to win, let's go.

31:27.600 --> 31:32.300
Watch me for the signals.
Stay focused. And don't worry...

31:33.500 --> 31:39.000
...I'm behind you.
Let's go !

31:42.600 --> 31:47.600
That Moxon ain't worth the Charmin
Extra-soft he wipes his butt with.

31:48.200 --> 31:52.700
He's hurt bad, Mox.
It's all my fault.

31:53.600 --> 31:58.100
I-right, 494, Z-post, on one.

31:58.500 --> 32:02.700
I-right, 494, Z-post, on one.
Ready ? Break !

32:03.400 --> 32:08.600
<i>- Here we go, Moxon at quarterback.
- He scratches better than he throws.</i>

32:32.400 --> 32:36.400
- Jon Moxon with a 40-yard pass !
- Where'd this kid come from ?

32:36.700 --> 32:39.000
That's my boy !

32:39.600 --> 32:44.000
- Everybody on the ball !
- He's got to stop the clock !

32:50.600 --> 32:52.700
<i>The clock's still running !</i>

33:20.500 --> 33:23.800
I can't... Fuck it.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.000
I don't know what play they're calling.
How's your arm ?

33:28.400 --> 33:32.300
Last chance for the Coyotes.
Moxon at quarterback.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.000
This is not the formation !

33:37.500 --> 33:41.400
<i>Moxon hands off to Brown.
Throwback pass... complete !</i>

33:42.200 --> 33:47.000
<i>Moxon has the football, heading for
the end zone. Touchdown !</i>

33:48.500 --> 33:53.800
<i>Good grief ! Bud Kilmer pulls off
another one ! Unbelievable !</i>

34:07.400 --> 34:09.000
Holy shit...

34:15.500 --> 34:20.800
- Mr Harbor, Lance is out of surgery.
- How long is he out ?

34:21.199 --> 34:25.900
- Any chance for this season ?
- Lance tore every ligament he's got.

34:26.400 --> 34:30.300
- He'll need several surgeries.
- How long ?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.800
Minimum a year and a half, if ever.

34:37.500 --> 34:42.100
Oh, no...
Lance's ride...

34:43.500 --> 34:48.000
His scholarship to Florida State.
Jesus...

34:48.400 --> 34:52.600
I'm amazed he lasted this long.
I removed scar tissue from his knee.

34:54.400 --> 34:58.900
- He shouldn't even have been playing.
- He never said anything to me.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.900
Moxon, get some shut-eye.

35:05.200 --> 35:10.100
The Harbors appreciate your being
here, but there's nothing you can do.

35:15.400 --> 35:20.900
- You go home, I'll stay with them.
- All right. I'll call you.

35:26.100 --> 35:29.600
Well, I guess I should be going, too,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.900
this being a family thing and all.

35:47.400 --> 35:51.400
- Thanks again for the ride, Mox.
- No problem.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.600
- What the hell are you doing ?
- Changing.

36:01.600 --> 36:06.300
I'm wearing underwear. It covers up
the same as a bathing suit.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.700
- Does it really bother you ?
- Whatever...

36:11.500 --> 36:14.600
I can handle it.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.500
This has been the worst night
of my life.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.600
You really aren't looking.
You're sweet.

36:25.100 --> 36:29.500
- Lance is gonna be all right.
- His career's probably over.

36:29.900 --> 36:33.400
You guys are gonna be all right.
You love each other.

36:33.800 --> 36:39.000
Things change, Mox.
I don't wanna think about it right now.

36:39.400 --> 36:43.000
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

36:43.300 --> 36:46.600
I mean, what about you and Jules ?

36:47.000 --> 36:51.700
- Is there a future ?
- Yeah... I mean, she's great.

36:52.100 --> 36:55.300
I got another year
till she's graduating...

36:55.700 --> 36:59.400
I love spending time with her.

36:59.700 --> 37:04.600
Things change, Mox.
You're the starting quarterback now.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.700
- Well, you're here.
- You're not coming in ?

37:19.100 --> 37:24.500
Not tonight. It doesn't seem right
with Lance all fucked-up.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.500
You don't always have to do
the right thing, Mox.

37:36.800 --> 37:39.700
We'll continue this any time you want.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.700
Hey, girls.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.700
- Hey, Tweeder, how you doing ?
- Good. How are you ?

38:03.100 --> 38:08.900
- Well, if it ain't Charley Tweeder.
- Yes, it is.

38:11.300 --> 38:15.200
- How are we doing tonight ?
- <i>We</i> are doing fine.

38:15.500 --> 38:19.600
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you, too.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.700
Congratulations for what ?

38:23.000 --> 38:26.800
For getting to wear
such cute "mount me" hats.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.900
- Mount me ?
- Not right away. After a few drinks...

38:32.400 --> 38:36.400
We just wanna make sure
no one drinks and drives.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.700
- You got a smart mouth.
- I know, and I'm gonna watch it.

38:41.100 --> 38:46.000
I'm gonna go home. Take these drinks.
I don't wanna drink and drive.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.000
There'll be no drinking and no driving.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.500
- It's time for you to go home.
- You're right. I'm going home.

38:54.900 --> 38:58.600
- All right ? I'm going home.
- Bye, Tweeder.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.100
- You hurt my feelings. I'm going home.
- Where's Billy Bob ?

39:03.500 --> 39:07.700
- And you can kiss my ass !
- He's taking the car !

39:09.300 --> 39:12.100
I'm gonna go to jail.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.600
Son of a bitch !

39:27.700 --> 39:30.900
- Great game tonight.
- Thanks.

39:32.400 --> 39:37.400
- How much ?
- Your money's no good here.

40:22.300 --> 40:26.400
<i>Moxon, you are under arrest for not
being naked with a sophomore chick</i>

40:26.800 --> 40:31.100
<i>who wants to bathe you
with her tongue. Get in the car !</i>

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
- Tweeder ?
- Damn right.

40:33.800 --> 40:40.000
We're all naked and we got handcuffs
and cool shit to play with.

40:40.500 --> 40:45.600
- Now take off your clothes and get in.
- Mox, will you come keep me warm ?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.300
Oh, shit...

40:50.400 --> 40:54.200
I can't go with you,
but I'll give you my jacket.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.300
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

40:59.500 --> 41:03.300
Sorry, Mox, I got to bail.
Ladies...

41:04.400 --> 41:06.300
Shut up and hold on to your nipples.

41:24.900 --> 41:30.600
- You weren't asleep, were you ?
- No, I was naming my unborn children.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.800
- How's Lance ?
- He's out of the first surgery.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.200
They'll have to go back in there
in a few weeks.

41:39.200 --> 41:44.100
- I'm gonna go see him tomorrow.
- I heard you played a great game.

41:44.500 --> 41:48.900
- It was strange.
- Strange to be a god now ?

41:52.300 --> 41:54.600
I don't know. I mean...

41:55.400 --> 41:58.000
We did win, you know ?

41:59.500 --> 42:04.300
I don't know. I've just been
walking around for a while.

42:05.200 --> 42:09.500
- What's wrong ? Want me to come out ?
- No...

42:10.800 --> 42:13.900
I'm just gonna go home.

42:20.500 --> 42:26.100
It's been a really weird night.
I don't know... I'll see you tomorrow.

42:35.700 --> 42:40.600
They stole a State Trooper car,
and then they exposed themselves

42:41.000 --> 42:46.800
to the Ladies' Auxiliary.
These players nowadays are lawless.

42:47.800 --> 42:53.200
They're all hopped up on beer
and painkillers, is what it is.

42:53.600 --> 42:56.100
They exposed themselves ?

42:56.400 --> 43:00.200
They pressed their wangers
against the glass at the Alano Club

43:00.600 --> 43:04.300
while the girls were rehearsing
the Christmas pageant.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.100
Wangers on the glass
at the Alano Club ? No. No good.

43:11.600 --> 43:18.100
We never stole no cars. I can't let
these boys get away with this stuff.

43:18.500 --> 43:23.400
Earl... Are my boys
too much trouble for you ?

43:25.500 --> 43:29.400
No, Coach. They're just kids.

43:31.600 --> 43:36.800
- Sam's boy looked good last Friday.
- They all get a sweet hand sometime.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.300
Moxon sure ain't got what Lance had.

44:28.300 --> 44:33.800
I want to know where Jon Moxon
came from. A 40-yard touchdown !

44:55.800 --> 44:58.400
- Nice game, Jonathan.
- Thank you.

44:58.700 --> 45:01.600
See you in class.

45:02.800 --> 45:07.200
Bitching wheels. That's a nice car
on a teacher's salary.

45:09.400 --> 45:14.200
- I'm going to see Lance. Wanna come ?
- This is Olin Buchanan of KPJT.

45:14.600 --> 45:16.800
How is it to be out of Harbor's shadow

45:17.100 --> 45:20.100
<i>and showing everyone
you've been underrated ?</i>

45:21.900 --> 45:26.300
<i>Gee... Lance Harbor
left some pretty big shoes to fill.</i>

45:26.900 --> 45:30.300
<i>I don't know that I'll ever
get the job done like he did.</i>

45:30.700 --> 45:33.000
<i>Are you planning to play
in the Ivy League ?</i>

45:33.900 --> 45:38.900
Ivy League... ?
Heck, I don't know.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.000
I don't know.

45:41.700 --> 45:45.600
I just want to thank God
and my team-mates for the win today.

45:46.500 --> 45:53.000
I mean, Jonathan Moxon's
only one man... I'm just one man.

45:55.700 --> 45:59.300
- Thanks.
- All right. Thank you.

46:03.800 --> 46:08.500
"Gee" ? "Heck" ?
You even thanked God.

46:08.900 --> 46:12.000
- You're a scary superstar.
- Come on, Jules.

46:12.400 --> 46:17.200
You referred to yourself as one man.
You're really enjoying this.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.500
Why not ? It's a trip.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.700
I'm gonna go meet my dad.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.900
All right.

46:59.100 --> 47:03.000
Let's razzle-dazzle the dummy D
with the old hook and ladder.

47:03.300 --> 47:08.100
- That play don't work.
- We'll have a little fun then !

47:08.600 --> 47:13.700
Hook and ladder, left, on one.
Ready ? Break !

47:15.100 --> 47:19.200
Is this the one where I trot downfield
and act like I'm lost ?

47:19.600 --> 47:23.700
- Huddle back up again.
- Give me a huddle !

47:24.500 --> 47:28.500
- Tweeder's gonna pitch you the ball.
- No !

47:28.900 --> 47:33.400
Just catch the ball ! "Oh, a ball.
I'm gonna catch it." That's all.

47:33.800 --> 47:38.100
- I'm not an eligible receiver.
- Just catch the damn ball.

47:38.500 --> 47:41.300
- Fine.
- Ready ? Break !

47:59.800 --> 48:04.500
When did the circus come to town ?
I didn't see no trucks.

48:04.900 --> 48:08.700
- It would've been six if he caught it.
- For which team ?

48:09.100 --> 48:14.100
You listen hard. Stick to the basics !
Stick to the basics ! Stick to the basics !

48:15.500 --> 48:21.700
We're a running team. You only call
what I tell you to call. You hear me ?

48:22.300 --> 48:26.300
You are the damn dumbest
smart kid I know.

48:33.800 --> 48:35.400
Come in.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.200
No, don't sit.
It won't take a minute.

48:45.500 --> 48:50.300
You're dragging ass,
and it's fucking up my universe.

48:50.700 --> 48:53.600
You're fat, slow,
all of a sudden you're lazy.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.800
If it wasn't for you,
I'd still have Lance.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.200
- Coach, my head...
- I don't want no excuses.

49:02.500 --> 49:04.700
I want you to fix it.

49:10.500 --> 49:14.200
Get out of here.
Get the hell out.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.800
Mox, wait up.

49:23.900 --> 49:26.400
- What time ?
- What time what ?

49:26.700 --> 49:32.200
When are you coming over tonight ?
It's half-price night at the gun club.

49:32.800 --> 49:35.600
My folks never get home before twelve.

49:38.500 --> 49:43.700
- I visited Lance today in the...
- This is about you and me.

49:44.100 --> 49:47.700
I've known you my whole life.

49:48.200 --> 49:52.300
I'm not telling anyone
you're coming over.

49:52.700 --> 49:55.400
Anytime after seven.

50:08.100 --> 50:11.900
Why be good ? I'm always good.

50:12.400 --> 50:15.300
Where's my upside to being good ?

50:18.200 --> 50:23.500
I'm 18, it's not like I'm married to her.
She invited me. I'm just being polite.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.900
Right, Kyle ?
Kyle... ?

50:27.200 --> 50:32.800
I only answer to one name :
The great El Ali Akbar Shabazz Da.

50:33.700 --> 50:38.400
- That's a bunch of names.
- There's only one God. Praise Allah.

50:39.800 --> 50:43.600
Yeah, but would Allah nail Darcy
if he had the chance ?

50:47.700 --> 50:51.200
- I think he would.
<i>- As-Salaam Alaikum.</i>

50:52.600 --> 50:54.100
Okay...

51:04.700 --> 51:08.900
- I gave up on you.
- Am I too late ?

51:10.200 --> 51:11.500
Come in.

51:18.200 --> 51:23.200
I'm glad you came. It's kind of weird
to have you in my house.

51:23.600 --> 51:28.100
Yeah, I feel like
I'm doing something illegal.

51:28.500 --> 51:31.400
Well, not yet.

51:34.600 --> 51:39.000
Look at me, I'm a mess.
No one ever sees me like this.

51:39.600 --> 51:43.100
I think this is the best
I've ever seen you look.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.100
You're sweet, Mox,
but you know you are.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.400
Nice house.

51:52.300 --> 51:55.400
I was about to make
an ice cream sundae.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.400
You want one ?

51:59.500 --> 52:03.900
- Yeah, have one. I'll make it.
- All right.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.900
- Do you want whipped cream ?
- Sure.

52:46.500 --> 52:49.000
Come here.

53:02.500 --> 53:05.700
Wait, wait, wait.
I can't.

53:06.400 --> 53:10.900
We can't. This is not...
I'm really sorry.

53:11.300 --> 53:16.700
- What ? You're sorry ?
- There's Lance, there's Jules...

53:17.200 --> 53:20.800
I don't know if I love Jules,
but I might.

53:21.100 --> 53:24.600
What I do know is, I don't love you,
but Lance might love you...

53:25.000 --> 53:29.500
I don't love Lance.
It was never about love.

53:32.500 --> 53:37.600
It was about me getting a better life.
Lance and I were gonna leave.

53:38.200 --> 53:44.000
Now he'll stay in West Canaan, manage
a Wal-Mart and coach JV football.

53:45.300 --> 53:47.600
Darcy...

53:48.800 --> 53:51.500
I just wanted to go with you.

53:55.700 --> 53:59.200
You're gonna get out of West Canaan
on your own.

54:00.100 --> 54:02.700
You're smart.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.500
- Unbelievable.
- What ?

54:12.600 --> 54:17.100
I usually fall for
the whipped-cream bikini every time.

54:22.300 --> 54:26.500
Wendell, meet me at the mini-mart
at 10:00 tonight.

54:26.900 --> 54:30.900
- For what ?
- I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you.

54:31.300 --> 54:36.600
- Where's Billy Bob ? I can't find him.
- Kilmer.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.100
He's been
riding the fuck out of Billy Bob.

54:41.100 --> 54:45.400
Blaming him for Lance's knee.
Look man, I'm over this shit.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.100
- I hear you.
- You don't hear me.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.400
Kilmer's a fucking racist.

54:51.800 --> 54:56.600
You know how many yards
I average a game ? 133.

54:57.100 --> 55:00.100
You know how many
touchdowns I have ?

55:01.000 --> 55:04.900
Three. That's only because
I broke for over twenty yards each time.

55:05.300 --> 55:11.100
If we're inside the 10, he gives the ball
to Lance or some white receiver.

55:11.700 --> 55:14.800
It's bullshit.
I'm just Kilmer's black workhorse.

55:15.500 --> 55:19.700
- Kilmer...
- Would he call Texas or A&M for me ?

55:20.100 --> 55:24.900
Fuck, no !
My mom's been doing my recruiting.

55:25.300 --> 55:28.100
She's got Grambling coming to see me.

55:28.400 --> 55:34.200
Damn, Mox, I thought you knew.
This shit's fucked-up.

55:34.700 --> 55:37.900
Fuck Kilmer.
I'll get you in the end zone.

55:43.900 --> 55:47.900
We're cool, Mox.
Hey...

55:49.800 --> 55:54.200
You got shit to tend to.
I'll see you at practice.

55:56.300 --> 56:01.400
- Hey, how are you ?
- Tell me not to feel weird around you.

56:02.900 --> 56:06.700
The last thing I need right now
is for anything to come between us.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.900
We're friends.
We're just a little closer now.

56:11.600 --> 56:15.700
- Okay ?
- Yeah, I guess we are.

56:16.700 --> 56:20.400
- Thanks, Mox.
- No problem.

56:33.900 --> 56:36.000
Wait a minute ! Jules !

56:38.000 --> 56:43.400
Would you listen to me ?
Bitches are all just panty droppers.

56:43.800 --> 56:48.200
- You understand ? That's it.
- What ?

56:49.300 --> 56:54.000
You give them a Percocet,
two Vicodins and a couple of beers,

56:54.400 --> 57:00.000
and the panties drop.
It's very nice.

57:00.900 --> 57:05.800
- You think you'll enjoy prison ?
- I don't know... What ?

57:08.900 --> 57:15.400
- Where are we going tonight ?
- It's a surprise. I'm bringing Lance.

57:15.900 --> 57:18.000
Nice...

57:20.500 --> 57:22.700
What the fuck is that ?

57:40.800 --> 57:44.600
Oh, my God.
It's star quarterback Jonny Moxon.

57:44.900 --> 57:49.300
- Somebody hold me up.
- There's nothing going on with Darcy.

57:49.700 --> 57:52.000
Nothing's ever happened.

57:52.400 --> 57:57.400
You've never seen her
in her whipped-cream bikini ?

58:01.800 --> 58:05.700
- No.
- Funny. That's how she got Lance.

58:06.100 --> 58:10.200
- Jules, are we together or what ?
- I don't date football players.

58:10.600 --> 58:14.700
- I've always been a football player.
- Number 26.

58:16.800 --> 58:19.500
No, you were something different.

58:20.700 --> 58:23.400
At least I thought you were.

58:26.500 --> 58:34.300
What a Kodak moment. Star Jonny
Moxon wondering who he really is.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.100
- You don't think all this is hard ?
- On who ?

58:38.400 --> 58:41.100
- Jules !
- Mox !

58:41.400 --> 58:44.100
We had a thing and it was great.

58:44.500 --> 58:47.800
Things have changed a little bit.
That's okay.

58:49.200 --> 58:53.300
- Maybe you should go.
- You can't make me leave.

58:56.900 --> 59:01.200
Oh, my God !
Everybody come meet Jonny Moxon.

59:01.600 --> 59:06.800
The Mox ! The star quarterback
of the Coyotes is at my window.

59:07.200 --> 59:12.100
- Good game, man.
- I'm your number-one fan.

59:44.600 --> 59:49.100
These are from Brett.
You boys are on the house all night.

59:50.500 --> 59:52.800
- Gentlemen...
- I'm gonna go nuts.

59:53.200 --> 59:56.700
My gift to you.
To Kilmer !

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.400
- Fuck Kilmer !
- Take my shot, you know I don't drink.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.600
- You're drinking tonight.
- We got Elwood tomorrow.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.500
Relax. Just chill, Wendell,
and look over your left shoulder.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.900
Goddamn...

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.700
- Keep your shirt on, Billy Bob.
- It's a strip club, I'm here to work !

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.200
Here you go, have a beer.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.200
Of all these guys, you're the only one
who visited me in hospital.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.000
You're a good friend.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.500
And also, I have to say...

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.800
Thanks for dragging me here.
I appreciate everything you've done.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.300
You're not gonna try and hug me now ?

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.600
- Oh, my God, it's Miss Davis !
- Holy shit !

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.900
I want you to know I'm 18, and I've
had sex with older women before.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.900
It was topical, it was erotic...

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.500
I gave it a 9.5.
I still got wood. Still !

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.800
I gave it a 10. A fucking 10 !

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.100
Gentlemen,
I'd like to propose a toast.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.500
- To Miss Davis.
- 10 !

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:42.100
- Fuck me, it's seven o'clock.
- What did you just say ?

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.000
It's seven o'clock.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.300
- God, what's that smell ?
- That's us.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.500
Are we playing tonight ?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.900
Jon Moxon, finding out
how the other half lives.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:20.100
<i>- He got crushed on that play.
- It's a true slaughter out there.</i>

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.200
<i>Kilmer can't be happy with his team.</i>

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:28.100
Let the pom-pom girls play for you !
Worst game I ever seen !

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:33.400
- You said Elwood wasn't that good.
- They ain't. We're playing like shit.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.400
- Can you stop them from planting me ?
- I got the squirts, Mox.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:45.500
- That liquor's still in my system.
- I keep seeing Davis' ass in my face.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.800
I'm hung-over, too. We're gonna
suck it up and put one in the end zone.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.900
I-right, 495 curl, on one.
Eyes up !

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.200
Ready ? Break !

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:23.600
The hard work of so many
sacrificed...

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.700
...by the disrespect of a few.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.300
Moxon...

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:42.100
You sacrificed the honour of this team
and the town that supports it.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.300
Shit, you poisoned my team, son !

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.600
I hope last night was fun.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.000
Was it fun ?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.200
Your daddy was a no-talent pussy,
but at least he listened !

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:23.700
Oh... little Billy Bob...
Cry-baby ?

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.800
You cost me my perfect season.
How does it feel ?

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.000
Cry me a river, you fat fucking baby !
You disgust me.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.600
My star quarterback is dragging
his leg around because of you !

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And I got to watch you cry about it !

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.100
You know what ?
Get the fuck out of here.

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:50.899
I don't wanna see your fat face !
Get the fuck out of here.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.899
People say you dragged ass because
you organised a drinking party.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.899
- Save it, Dad.
- Save what ?

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:26.500
- You got the opportunity of a lifetime.
- It's not the opportunity of a lifetime.

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:30.100
Your attitude's wrong.
This is your opportunity...

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:35.300
Playing football here may have been
the opportunity of <i>your</i> lifetime.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.500
But I don't want your life.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.399
- What the hell's Bacon doing here ?
- Billy Bob wants you to take him.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.000
- Mind if I take a seat ?
- Don't move.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.500
This is for most-improved player
at lineman camp.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.800
I was eleven.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.500
- How'd you find me ?
- What the hell are you doing ?

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.400
Championship trophy. Steelers.
We were nine.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.200
Remember this shit ?
Playing pee-wee ?

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.000
- Yeah, it was fun.
- No, it wasn't.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.800
I remember getting yelled at.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.000
"Too fat, Billy Bob !"

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.200
"Too slow and dumb !"

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.300
We were just little kids, Mox.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.900
It's like nothing was ever good enough.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.200
- It's almost over.
- No.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.000
It's over, man. It's so over.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.700
- Come on. This is bullshit.
- What ?

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.600
You're gonna let football get you ?
You're gonna let Kilmer win ?

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.700
What am I supposed to do ?
Why don't you fucking tell me.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:49.100
Quit ! Who gives a fuck about Kilmer's
23rd district championship ? I don't.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:54.200
I do !
I do...

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.800
Coach loved me like a son.
Treated me like one, too.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:05.700
He told me to protect Lance,
and I didn't. I fucked everything up.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.100
Kilmer fucked up,
and everyone knows it.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.100
That's where you're wrong, Mox.
You're wrong.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.100
Look, we got one more game left,
and we need you.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.600
I need you.
Who the fuck's gonna protect my ass ?

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.400
Come on.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.500
Your boney ass ?

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:55.600
I don't think I have a boney ass.
I think I have a very nice ass.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.700
It is kind of nice.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:19.900
Yeah ! Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on, you son of a bitch !

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.600
- We're worried about the Gilroy game.
- It's their first year in our district.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:36.600
They were 4-A last year. They've been
killing people since they came to 3-A.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.300
Believe me,
Mox <i>will</i> stick to the game plan.

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:44.600
- That's what we came to hear.
- Thank you, Sam.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:52.200
- What's the deal with these kids ?
- These are my people.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.900
Kyle, did you start a cult ?
That's so sweet !

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:00.600
Out ! Come on, freakos, get lost !

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:07.700
Now that's it ! No more religions.
You're healthy, you're playing football.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.100
Jonny,
this letter came for you yesterday.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.600
Brown...

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:33.500
"You have been admitted to the
235th class to enter Brown University."

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:38.400
Jon... Great, Jon...

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.600
"Your university grant package
will cover your full financial need."

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.400
I'm real proud about Brown,
but I need to talk to you about Gilroy.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:53.300
- Gilroy ?
- Yeah.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.500
Tell me who wins.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:07.000
- Why are you so damn happy ?
- My cat's okay.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.500
I took your advice.
They scanned my cat, I can play !

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.300
They scanned your cat... ?
You got a CAT scan.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:19.500
The doctor said you got a human brain
and it works ? That's great !

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.400
Good news.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.000
Gentlemen, now that none of us
are inebriated,

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.000
I wanted to remind you
of our conversation.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.900
- I appreciate you not saying anything.
- We made a pact.

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:45.500
- Really ?
- Miss Davis...

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.300
Would you go to the prom with me ?

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.900
Jog it in.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.700
- How are you feeling, Jonny ?
- All right, I guess.

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:09.500
You understand that by running
the ball we control the clock,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.400
and we can grind them,
and the tempo of the game, way down ?

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.600
Are you hearing me ?

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.900
You disobey me and I will bury you.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.900
I know about your Brown scholarship.
I got your grades under review.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:35.000
I can fuck with your transcripts
and get this whole deal blown for you.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:46.500
I get what I want,
and you get what you want.

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.700
That's it.

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:10.900
- Hi.
- What do you want ?

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:15.600
I'm really sorry.
I really need to talk to you.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:20.200
- It's late.
- I got into Brown today.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:26.600
- A full academic scholarship.
- That's great. I'm so proud of you.

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.200
What's wrong ?

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:36.600
Kilmer's threatening to fuck up my
scholarship if I don't play by his rules.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.100
- Then quit.
- I can't.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.700
- Then play. It's just a football game.
- No, it's not.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.800
If it was just football, I'd play.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:52.800
I love football, when it's pure,
but this...

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:59.800
- This isn't pure.
- I don't understand.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.900
If I play for Kilmer tomorrow,
and we win, he wins.

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:10.600
West Canaan will go on believing
he's the best coach who ever lived.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.500
What about the next team he coaches ?
And the one after that ?

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.100
What if my little brother
ends up playing for him ?

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:24.900
I'd be buying into everything
that's wrong with this town.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:30.300
You want some cheese
with that whine ?

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:35.900
You're a whiner. Why don't you
just step up and play the hero ?

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.000
The hero ?

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.900
You're a football guy.
You know about heroes.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.700
But heroes win.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.300
What if I lose ?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.400
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:11.000
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:17.400
<i>Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses</i>

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.500
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.700
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:31.700
<i>For Thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever.</i>

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.300
<i>Amen.</i>

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.300
Listen up, people.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:52.900
Everything you've done
to this point means nothing.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:57.800
The practices in the heat mean nothing,
the games we won mean nothing,

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:04.100
if you don't win tonight.
No district title, no shot at state.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:12.700
This game is 48 minutes
for the next 48 years of your life.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.600
Coyotes on three !
One, two, three...

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.500
West Canaan versus Gilroy
for the whole magilla.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.100
This is what it's all about.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.000
Coyotes will receive the ball.

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:48.200
Shake hands.
Let's have a good, hard-hitting game.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:52.700
Pass out the ammunition,
let's go to war.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:14.400
I-right, shift-52. We are a running team.
Remember what I said.

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:20.300
Now go fetch me a championship.
Get down their throats now !

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.800
A great drive, Brown the whole way.
You can stamp "US made" on his butt.

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.000
<i>- First and goal from the eight.
- You got to give it to Brown.</i>

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.200
Slot-left, 35 dive.
Move your ass, let's go !

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.300
Slot-left, 35 dive.

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.100
- Fucking Kilmer ! This is fucked-up !
- We'll change that to 25 dive.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:26.800
Somebody have a problem with Wendell
putting it in ? I didn't think so.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:32.500
Slot-left, 25 dive, on one.
Ready ? Break !

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400
Take it in !

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:11.100
- Thanks, Mox.
- Let's go.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.900
Keep it up, asshole.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:18.900
<i>Coyotes leading 7-0.
Gilroy with the football at midfield.</i>

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.900
Bosell gets the pitch.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.800
<i>He's at the 40, 35...</i>

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.200
<i>He's at the 30... 20... 15...</i>

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500
Touchdown ! Good grief !

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.600
<i>What a hit on Brown !</i>

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.400
<i>That was a ferocious hit.
He's in pain.</i>

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:10.200
<i>And if he can't come back in and play,
what about the Coyotes ?</i>

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.300
Get me off the field !

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.300
He tore something.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.700
- Can you fix him ?
- If he'll let us.

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:31.500
- Make him understand.
- Yes, sir.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:36.400
- How you feeling, boy ?
- I'm all right, Coach.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.800
Let the old trainer take a look at it.

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:44.500
<i>Gilroy with the football.
The quarterback wants to throw.</i>

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.100
<i>He throws long... it's caught !</i>

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.700
<i>Touchdown, Gilroy !</i>

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:59.700
And look at Mad Dog dance
with the football. Get some mustard.

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.600
There ain't no room for that stuff.

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:14.900
- Kneel on it.
- There's 1:22 left. Let me throw it.

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:19.400
I ain't interested in another turnover.
Get out there !

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:28.400
Move it ! He thinks I'm here
for his entertainment.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.400
<i>The clock's winding down.
I can't say that I understand this.</i>

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.200
Moxon kneeling on the ball.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.600
<i>- That's gutless.
- And listen to this crowd.</i>

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:58.700
<i>At the end of the first half,
Coyotes trailing 14 to 7.</i>

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
You're a gamer, Wendell.
Let's do this, you'll be good to go.

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.000
- What are you doing ?
- He's getting back in the game.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.900
- Wendell, don't do this.
- I heard a pop.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:24.000
- I think he's hurt pretty bad.
- You know nothing about dedication.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.900
But I do.

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:34.200
- Don't do it, it's not worth it.
- He wants us to lose. The missing link !

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.100
- Maybe I shouldn't do it.
- Get out, before I lose my temper.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:47.100
If that needle goes near him, I'll rip
your arms off and beat you with them !

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.700
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has to do with all of us.

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:58.300
We kill ourselves for you. Year round,
we play hurt, we play sick...

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:03.700
We're scared you'll kick our ass,
because you don't give a fuck about us.

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:09.500
- All you care about is your next title.
- Give him the shot !

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.500
If you do, find another quarterback.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.100
- You ready to lose that scholarship ?
- If it keeps the needle out of his leg.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.500
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- That's good ! That's good !

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:29.100
- Finally ! Tweeder, you take the snaps.
- No, I won't.

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.600
I'm out, Coach.

01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:36.900
- What did you say ?
- I'm with them.

01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:41.100
The only way we're going back out
on that field is without you.

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:03.400
Get your helmets on and take the field.
Let's go. Let's go now !

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.000
Let's go, goddammit !

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:21.000
I'm walking out that door.
I want you all to trust me.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:26.500
Follow me out there.
Let's go.

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.900
Let's go...
Let's go after that title.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.200
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:35.400
Kilmer said, 48 minutes
for the next 48 years of our lives.

01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.400
I say, fuck that.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:44.400
Fuck that.
Let's go out there,

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:50.700
play the next 24 minutes for the next
24 minutes, and leave it on the field.

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:56.000
We have the opportunity to play
like gods for the next half of football.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.900
But we can't be afraid to lose.
There's no room for fear in this game.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:08.300
If we go out there and half-ass it
because we're scared,

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:13.500
all we're left with is an excuse.
We're always gonna wonder.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.600
But if we go out there
and give it absolutely everything...

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.400
That's heroic.

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:29.800
Let's be heroes.

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.900
Come on.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.700
What do you say, boys ?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:35.600
<i>Field goal for Gilroy. They lead
17 to 7 with 8:10 left in the game.</i>

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
And still, no Bud Kilmer.

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.800
Listen up !
I need five wide receivers.

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:47.400
We're running the Oop-de-oop.
I want four receivers stacked left.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.800
Tweeder right. We overload their left.
They'll cover Tweeder one-on-one.

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.200
No huddles. I'll call the plays from the
line. They'll never know what hit them.

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:03.100
One, two, three, Coyotes !

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.300
Let's go !

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.900
<i>Pass completed to Tweeder for 16.
They're going again.</i>

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:24.900
- On the left ! On the right !
<i>- Look at all those receivers.</i>

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:26.800
Five ?

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:39.000
<i>Gonzalez, complete.
They hurry to the line of scrimmage.</i>

01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:52.700
<i>Long pass...</i>

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.300
Touchdown !

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:10.200
<i>While they celebrate,
I have a question :</i>

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:16.200
- Where in the world is Bud Kilmer ?
- He's nowhere to be found.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.000
Let's go, defence !

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.700
- They're punting it.
- And we're out of time-outs.

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:28.800
- If we don't block this, it's over.
- Coach Lance, put me in. We'll block it.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:34.900
- You wanna play defence ?
- Put me in there, we'll block it !

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.200
Get out there.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:41.100
38 seconds left to play in the game.
Gilroy leads 17 to 14.

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:46.400
<i>Billy Bob has come into the game.</i>

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:27.000
<i>Charley Tweeder blocks the punt !
He blocks the punt !</i>

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:32.700
Billy Bob opens a hole up for Tweeder.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:36.500
- What a great job !
- They still have a chance.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:42.200
Twins right, Z-out on one. Tweeder,
make sure you get out of bounds.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.100
Ready ? Break !

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:08.900
Tweeder didn't get out of bounds.
The clock is still running.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:16.300
Quick ! On the ball !
Get down !

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.000
Billy Bob, this is it. The man who
got us here. Are you ready ?

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:47.500
You don't think that lame-ass play
where I act like I'm lost is gonna work ?

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:53.100
Split left 90, hook and ladder,
on one. Ready ? Break !

01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:02.300
Touchdown ! Touchdown ! Touchdown !

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.500
Oh my God ! Billy Bob !

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.100
- Good gosh almighty !
- Billy Bob ! Coyotes win !

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:06.000
<i>Coyotes win ! Coyotes win !
23 district championships !</i>

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.400
Mox !
Excuse me... Mox !

01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:19.000
- Mox !
- Down, down, down.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.100
Wait a minute.
I thought you only kissed heroes.

01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:35.100
<i>And for some of us,
it ended without us knowing.</i>

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.900
<i>Maybe these were the last days.
I never played football again.</i>

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:45.900
<i>But I will never forget that day.</i>

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.100
<i>Billy Bob cried
'cause he's a bit of a cryer.</i>

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:06.000
<i>And Tweeder drank beers 'cause...
Well, Tweeder drinks beer.</i>

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:14.800
<i>Lance is happy. He found his calling
as a football coach.</i>

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.600
<i>Wendell got his ride to Grambling.</i>

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:25.600
<i>That statue still stands, but only
because it was too heavy to move.</i>

01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.600
<i>Kilmer never coached again.</i>

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:35.700
<i>I took my scholarship and
will graduate from Brown University.</i>

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.300
<i>The day was ours...</i>

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.600
<i>...and no one can ever take it away.</i>
