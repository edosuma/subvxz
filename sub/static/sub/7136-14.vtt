01:46.767 --> 01:50.033
- Back in the old Greek times,
there lived a man named Orpheus.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.700
Loved his wife.

01:51.767 --> 01:54.033
Took it easy on the ouzo.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.633
Played a mean guitar.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.467
Upstanding guy.

01:57.533 --> 02:00.166
So,
what'd the almighty gods do?

02:00.233 --> 02:03.066
They fucked with him,
made his life Hades.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.400
Why?

02:04.467 --> 02:05.567
Because that's what
those in power do

02:05.633 --> 02:07.834
to those of us with none.

02:28.700 --> 02:32.300
- The time for action
has arrived.

02:32.367 --> 02:35.900
Tug, you waste Pancamo.

02:42.667 --> 02:45.300
- We don't like Burr Redding
anymore than you.

02:45.367 --> 02:47.500
- You want him dead,
we want him dead.

02:50.967 --> 02:52.266
- I want Morales.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.433
- I was in the hospital
ten days.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.600
I'd like to think that's when
this little brouhaha began,

03:26.667 --> 03:30.400
but I have an inkling it's
been brewing a lot longer.

03:30.467 --> 03:32.133
At any rate,
we narrowly missed

03:32.200 --> 03:35.667
a major war with
significant carnage.

03:35.734 --> 03:37.333
The question then becomes:

03:37.400 --> 03:39.533
what happens now?

03:39.600 --> 03:42.100
I'm gonna give you gentlemen
a couple of options.

03:42.166 --> 03:45.000
I could stick you both
in that cage,

03:45.066 --> 03:47.500
where you can maul each other
until one of you's dead

03:47.567 --> 03:49.767
and the other on death row.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.266
I could transfer you both
to different units,

03:52.333 --> 03:53.900
where you could
still kill each other,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.734
but not on my watch.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.867
Or we can come to
some kind of truce.

03:59.934 --> 04:02.033
What do you say?

04:14.367 --> 04:15.567
- Peace.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.133
- It's a beautiful thing.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.500
- Yeah, shake hands where
everybody can see it.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.200
- Burr, Burr, Burr.

04:47.266 --> 04:48.200
- You keep away from me.

04:48.266 --> 04:49.500
- Well, wait a minute, man.

04:49.567 --> 04:50.900
Wait, wait a second.

04:50.967 --> 04:52.900
- Hey, I know it was you
who tipped off them hacks.

04:52.967 --> 04:54.900
You betrayed me.

04:54.967 --> 04:58.700
Me, who raised you
like you was my own.

04:58.767 --> 05:02.033
If you was anybody else,
you'd be dead now.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.433
But I'm gonna let you live.

05:04.500 --> 05:08.066
Live with the shame
of what you done.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.000
Only you and me is through.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.333
- Whoa, step back, Chinaman.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.266
- Don't push your luck
with me, Guerra.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.800
And just 'cause you
and Redding made nice-nice

05:22.867 --> 05:25.367
doesn't mean I'm not gonna
whack your taco-eating ass.

05:25.433 --> 05:26.700
- I said step back.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.200
- Hey.

05:28.266 --> 05:30.767
- Jesus, man, you're not out of
the pod ten minutes,

05:30.834 --> 05:31.900
you're already causing trouble.

05:31.967 --> 05:32.900
- Come on.

05:32.967 --> 05:34.266
In the fucking cage!

05:47.333 --> 05:48.266
- Aah!

05:55.633 --> 05:57.633
- Supreme Allah.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.700
I heard you were dead.

05:59.767 --> 06:01.300
- Well, that's funny.

06:01.367 --> 06:03.834
I heard the same thing
about you.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.934
Guess you can't believe rumors.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.867
Like the one that says
you fools signed a treaty

06:07.934 --> 06:08.967
with Burr Redding.

06:09.033 --> 06:10.133
- What would you have done?

06:10.200 --> 06:11.867
- Tell you what I will do.

06:11.934 --> 06:14.000
That nigga's going down.

06:14.066 --> 06:15.333
- We've been trying to
ant hole that motherfucker

06:15.400 --> 06:16.667
since he got here.

06:16.734 --> 06:18.100
No success.

06:18.166 --> 06:21.500
- Besides, if he dies now,
the hacks'll be after us.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.600
- Yeah, not if he gets
greased by one of his own.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.033
- Who you got in mind?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.066
- Him.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.867
Augustus, how come
you ain't chowing

06:42.934 --> 06:44.734
with your old pal, Redding?

06:44.800 --> 06:46.834
- Take a fucking walk, Ketchup.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.834
- You know Omar White?

06:50.900 --> 06:52.433
He tried to kill me.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.700
Tug Daniels...

06:54.767 --> 06:56.533
he tried, too.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.967
But I'm still on my hind legs.

06:59.033 --> 07:00.667
Now that you're on the outs
with old Burr,

07:00.734 --> 07:02.266
you need a friend.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.433
- Yeah, well,
that ain't you, nigga.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.500
- Look, I want to make right
what I've done to you,

07:06.567 --> 07:08.000
putting you in this chair,

07:08.066 --> 07:09.667
putting you in Oz,

07:09.734 --> 07:11.567
so remember...

07:13.300 --> 07:15.367
From now on...

07:15.433 --> 07:17.667
I got your back covered.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.667
- Redding meet your
new cellmate, the Colonel.

07:25.734 --> 07:28.133
- I don't want a cellmate.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.433
- Oh, jeez, your reservation
for the single suite

07:30.500 --> 07:32.367
must've got screwed up.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.266
- What the hell is
McManus thinking anyway,

07:36.333 --> 07:38.900
putting me and you
in here together?

07:38.967 --> 07:40.667
- I don't know.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.333
- Why'd he call you
"the Colonel"?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.467
- Because that's what I am.

07:51.367 --> 07:53.066
- You're a Marine.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.300
- Affirmative.

07:55.367 --> 07:57.800
- I was in the Army myself,

07:57.867 --> 08:01.233
Fourth Armored Cav,
First Infantry Division.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.433
Vietnam.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.266
- I was in Vietnam.

08:06.333 --> 08:09.533
Third Battalion,
Fourth Marines.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.433
- You know, McManus might not be
as stupid as I thought he was.

08:22.233 --> 08:24.433
Make yourself at home.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.867
Colonel...

08:30.767 --> 08:33.533
I just might have
a little mission for you,

08:33.600 --> 08:36.600
a search and destroy.

08:42.033 --> 08:44.767
- Well, physically,
Omar White's fully recovered.

08:44.834 --> 08:47.233
I was planning to send him
back to Solitary today.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.834
- Hmm, Pete,
you had a session with him?

08:48.900 --> 08:50.800
- Yeah,
he's a volatile young man,

08:50.867 --> 08:52.734
but much of that
is fueled by drugs.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.133
- So, if we can keep
Omar White clean,

08:55.200 --> 08:56.900
then he's salvageable?

08:56.967 --> 08:58.200
- Tim, what are you--

08:58.266 --> 09:00.266
- I'm bringing him back
to Em City.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.633
- Tim, he stabbed you.

09:02.700 --> 09:03.934
- That's all the more reason

09:04.000 --> 09:05.700
for me to be the one
to make the effort.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.467
Hello, Omar.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.667
- Look, man...

09:20.734 --> 09:22.600
I'm sorry for shanking you.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.467
I just don't know
what comes over me.

09:24.533 --> 09:26.500
- I forgive you.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.133
- You do?

09:28.200 --> 09:31.800
- How'd you like to
come back to Em City?

09:31.867 --> 09:33.533
- Instead of Solitary?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.333
You don't have to
ask me twice, you know.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.800
- Well,
I can make that happen, but...

09:41.867 --> 09:45.133
we gotta go over
some ground rules.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.066
- Yo, man, so how you get
out of Solitary, man?

09:48.133 --> 09:50.400
McManus.

09:50.467 --> 09:52.266
He forgave me.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.000
- That motherfucker's
on crack.

09:54.066 --> 09:57.867
- Who you telling?

09:59.600 --> 10:03.200
- So, Orpheus' wife's
strolling along,

10:03.266 --> 10:05.900
gets bitten by a snake
and dies.

10:05.967 --> 10:08.834
Orpheus freaks out
and heads down

10:08.900 --> 10:11.867
into the underworld to demand
that his lady be returned.

10:11.934 --> 10:16.467
Then some Goddess says,
"Okay, on one condition.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.000
"If you look at her
before you get back to Earth,

10:19.066 --> 10:20.934
she'll disappear."

10:21.000 --> 10:23.100
With like ten feet to go,

10:23.166 --> 10:25.367
motherfucker turns around,

10:25.433 --> 10:28.433
and wifey's sent
right back to hell.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.500
Orpheus should've
known better.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.967
You don't fuck with the gods.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.200
- That's what I told him, Char,
but you know how men are.

10:38.266 --> 10:39.500
Yeah.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.600
- What,
you want something there, kid?

10:46.667 --> 10:48.800
- What kind of name is Yood?

10:48.867 --> 10:50.467
- What do you mean,
what kind of name?

10:50.533 --> 10:52.633
It's a last name.
Jesus.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.967
- Let's deal.

10:54.033 --> 10:56.066
- I meant, what kind
of nationality is Yood,

10:56.133 --> 10:57.133
you dumbass.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.533
- It's American.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.867
- There are no
American names, dumbass.

11:00.934 --> 11:02.133
- Quit calling me that.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.200
- Because there are
no Americans.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.567
- Oh, here we go again.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.633
- We're all from
someplace else originally.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.533
- My name...

11:10.600 --> 11:12.433
is American.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.467
- Your name is Dumbass.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.333
- Officer Howell.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.400
- What?

11:18.467 --> 11:19.600
- Do your job.

11:19.667 --> 11:20.800
- I'll call you back.

11:20.867 --> 11:23.367
Clayton, are you
starting shit again?

11:23.433 --> 11:25.367
- I'm just making
conversation.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.367
- Well, shut your trap.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.967
- Basil, you taking
Yood's side against mine?

11:35.033 --> 11:36.166
- Yeah, why shouldn't I?

11:36.233 --> 11:37.967
- 'Cause of what he is
and what we are.

11:38.033 --> 11:40.233
- What you are is a fuckwad.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.567
- Oh.

11:55.633 --> 11:57.300
Oh.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.033
Oh, Johnny.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.233
God, I've missed you so much.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.333
I didn't know
how much till now.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.133
- Shh, don't cry.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.300
Let's sit down.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.533
I want you to come home.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.033
Sweetheart, come home.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.867
- You know I can't.

12:20.934 --> 12:23.033
As much as I want to,
not for at least three years.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.467
- I won't make it
three years.

12:24.533 --> 12:25.800
- Yes, you will.

12:25.867 --> 12:27.533
You'll have to.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.900
For Robbie's sake.

12:29.967 --> 12:31.266
For mine.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.800
You being there waiting

12:34.867 --> 12:38.600
is the only thing
that keeps me whole, Abby.

12:38.667 --> 12:43.100
And someday you, me, and Robbie,
we're gonna be together again.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.200
And we're gonna laugh.

12:47.834 --> 12:51.734
- And we're gonna forget,
okay?

12:55.767 --> 12:58.867
Next week,
I want you to bring Robbie.

12:58.934 --> 13:01.033
I'm finally ready
to face my boy.

13:40.734 --> 13:41.934
- Basil.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.467
- Yeah?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.100
- Your son...

13:46.166 --> 13:47.500
you think he's gonna be okay

13:47.567 --> 13:49.867
growing up without a father?

13:49.934 --> 13:51.400
- What?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.800
- Now who's the fuckwad?

13:58.633 --> 14:01.233
- You crazy son of a bitch!

14:02.667 --> 14:04.133
- What the hell is going on?

14:04.200 --> 14:06.000
Open this fucking door now!

14:10.233 --> 14:13.200
You fucking pieces of shit!
Open this fucking door!

15:07.567 --> 15:09.900
- I'm headed home.

15:09.967 --> 15:11.367
- I'll walk out with you.

15:11.433 --> 15:12.700
- Ooh, I'll get that.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.166
- Leave it.
- Well, the stain might mess--

15:14.233 --> 15:16.767
- Leave it alone.

15:16.834 --> 15:20.166
The broken glass will
be there in the morning

15:20.233 --> 15:24.500
to remind me
of how drunk I am.

15:24.567 --> 15:25.934
- You can't drive
in this condition.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
- What's the worst
that can happen?

15:28.066 --> 15:29.700
Wrap myself around a tree?

15:29.767 --> 15:31.200
- Look, I'll call you a cab.

15:31.266 --> 15:32.200
- No.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.500
- Then I'll drive you myself.

15:37.133 --> 15:39.800
John Basil and I...

15:39.867 --> 15:42.300
had a lot in common.

15:42.367 --> 15:47.467
Good intentions
that turned to shit.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.333
He warned me about Clayton.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.200
I did nothing...

15:57.266 --> 16:01.467
'cause there was
nothing I could do.

16:01.533 --> 16:02.734
- Come on.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.433
Let me take you home.

16:18.500 --> 16:22.934
- Well, I just love
snow before Christmas.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.400
And I could tolerate it
in January.

16:27.467 --> 16:30.700
But come February,
snow is redundant.

16:33.934 --> 16:36.834
Well, good morning to you,
too.

16:36.900 --> 16:38.433
- I-I'm sorry.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.433
Good morning, Sister.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.700
- What's the matter?

16:43.767 --> 16:45.900
- I miss Keller.

16:45.967 --> 16:48.800
We can't call each other,
and if he's written me back,

16:48.867 --> 16:50.433
one of the Nazis
in the mail room

16:50.500 --> 16:52.834
probably destroyed
his letters.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.734
Or maybe he hasn't written.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.567
Maybe he's already
found somebody else.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.133
Maybe he's dead.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.367
- I'll contact the Head of
Psychiatry at Cedar Junction

17:04.433 --> 17:05.667
and find out
how Keller's doing.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.800
I'll even try to arrange

17:07.867 --> 17:10.000
a phone conversation
between you two.

17:10.066 --> 17:11.834
- Well,
that would be great, Sister.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.934
Because since he's been gone,
I just...

17:15.033 --> 17:17.266
I feel like...

17:17.333 --> 17:21.300
I don't know,
not dead, not empty.

17:21.367 --> 17:24.166
- Well, you know, Tobias, you
have a lot to be happy about.

17:24.233 --> 17:27.033
Your daughter's finally
beginning to respond normally,

17:27.100 --> 17:29.767
Katherine McClain is setting up
your parole hearing.

17:29.834 --> 17:32.734
- That's part of
all this weirdness inside me.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.734
If I get out...

17:36.800 --> 17:39.333
who will I be?

17:39.400 --> 17:42.734
- So, I've walked Steve Dawkins
through your case.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.900
I have to say,
I'm guardedly optimistic.

17:45.967 --> 17:47.367
- You actually think
there's a chance

17:47.433 --> 17:49.233
the parole board
might let me out?

17:49.300 --> 17:51.300
- Yes, yes, I do.

17:51.367 --> 17:54.066
- My God, Katherine, that--

17:54.133 --> 17:55.700
I can't thank you enough.

17:55.767 --> 17:57.233
- Hey, don't thank me till
you're on the other side

17:57.300 --> 17:58.233
of the wall.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.767
- Okay.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.100
But if I do go free, I'm gonna
take you out to dinner.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.133
Nicest restaurant
in the city,

18:04.200 --> 18:05.967
Dom, everything.

18:06.033 --> 18:08.000
- Hmm, I'd like that.

18:09.867 --> 18:12.367
- Are you married?

18:12.433 --> 18:13.700
- I'm...

18:13.767 --> 18:15.166
- You know what?
You don't have to answer that.

18:15.233 --> 18:16.667
What am I thinking,
asking you personal questions?

18:16.734 --> 18:17.667
You're my lawyer,
for Chrissake.

18:17.734 --> 18:18.934
- Tobias, stop.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.400
It's okay.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.767
I know every detail
of your personal life.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.834
Why shouldn't you know
something about mine?

18:25.734 --> 18:27.967
I'm divorced.

18:28.033 --> 18:29.367
- Any kids?

18:29.433 --> 18:31.533
- One, a son.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.333
He's eight.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.033
- That's the same age as Holly.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.633
- I know.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.100
- Oh, yeah, right.

18:40.367 --> 18:41.967
- Party's over.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.900
Let's go.

18:43.967 --> 18:45.433
- That's the problem
here in Oz.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.600
You never get to finish
a conversation.

18:47.667 --> 18:50.333
- Well, we're far
from finished, Tobias.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.433
- Okay, here he is.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.867
- Hello?

18:56.934 --> 18:57.867
- Chris?

18:57.934 --> 18:59.200
This is Sister Pete.

18:59.266 --> 19:00.433
I'm with Tobias.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.633
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.500
- Now, listen, Warden Glynn

19:03.567 --> 19:05.300
and the fellow
who runs Cedar Junction

19:05.367 --> 19:07.900
have agreed to this phone call
on the condition that I stay

19:07.967 --> 19:09.233
in the room here

19:09.300 --> 19:11.667
and that someone stay
with you there.

19:11.734 --> 19:15.133
So I'm afraid that
this won't be as...

19:15.200 --> 19:18.467
intimate as you might like.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.834
- Thanks, Sister.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.200
Toby, how are you?

19:23.266 --> 19:25.000
- Better now.

19:25.066 --> 19:26.033
You?

19:26.100 --> 19:27.734
- Hey, me, you know.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.700
Making new friends, surveying
the lay of the land.

19:30.767 --> 19:33.967
- Chris,
I might be getting paroled.

19:34.033 --> 19:35.266
- No shit?

19:35.333 --> 19:37.800
- Yeah, maybe as soon as
a couple weeks.

19:37.867 --> 19:39.166
I thought if I do,

19:39.233 --> 19:40.967
I'm gonna make the trip
up to Massachusetts.

19:41.033 --> 19:44.333
- Hey, Toby...don't.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.667
You know, if you are
lucky enough to get out,

19:46.734 --> 19:49.734
I want you to turn your back
on all this shit and run.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.734
You understand? You gotta
fucking run for your life.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.066
- You're giving me an order?

19:55.133 --> 19:57.166
- No, man,
I'm on my knees

19:57.233 --> 19:59.567
and I'm begging you,
stay away from me.

19:59.633 --> 20:00.567
I'm hanging up now.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.600
- Chris...

20:49.166 --> 20:50.600
- Thank you.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.767
Here we are.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.333
- Let me hold her.
- All right.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.400
- I never got the chance to
hold her when she was born.

20:56.467 --> 20:57.934
- You got it?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.400
- Yeah, I got her.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.667
- Okay.

21:00.734 --> 21:03.133
- Say hello to Grandpa, Jewel.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.166
- You named her Jewel?

21:05.233 --> 21:08.166
- Well, she is one,
isn't she?

21:08.233 --> 21:11.600
And Hank loved...
"You Were Meant for Me".

21:11.667 --> 21:13.834
- Jewel Schillinger.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.033
Jewel.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.533
Jewel, Jewel, Jewel.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.867
- Yeah, Vern,
she's real cute.

21:28.734 --> 21:30.767
- Her name's Jewel.

21:30.834 --> 21:33.200
- Jewel?

21:33.266 --> 21:36.500
Sure as hell hope the other kids
don't nickname her "Jew."

21:40.600 --> 21:42.400
- Yo, you Schallinger?

21:43.567 --> 21:45.600
- Schillinger.

21:45.667 --> 21:48.934
- Yo, bro,
I knew your son, Hank.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.533
- You knew my son?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.433
- I heard you're
a fucking pimp.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.800
- And proud of it, boy.

21:53.867 --> 21:56.166
My girls are the finest
on the strip.

21:56.233 --> 21:58.266
- And my son?

21:58.333 --> 21:59.700
- Short on some cash,

21:59.767 --> 22:01.367
wanted to rent out
his girlfriend.

22:01.433 --> 22:02.700
- All right, look...

22:02.767 --> 22:05.066
- Casey, Carrie,
something like that.

22:05.133 --> 22:06.600
Cute little blonde.

22:06.667 --> 22:07.967
- You fucking liar.

22:08.033 --> 22:09.533
- Wait a minute, chief.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.133
I don't want no trouble.

22:11.200 --> 22:15.233
But, fuck, I thought you knew
Hank pimped that bitch.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.400
Even a couple of
the brothers hit it.

22:17.467 --> 22:20.233
I'm surprised that baby
ain't come out golden brown.

22:28.266 --> 22:32.233
- There is the possibility that
Curtis Bennett is lying.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.066
- Well, how do I
find out the truth?

22:34.133 --> 22:36.133
- Have you discussed this
with Carrie?

22:36.200 --> 22:37.633
- No.
I can't see her again

22:37.700 --> 22:39.800
until I get visiting privileges
next week.

22:39.867 --> 22:43.133
- She has been talking to
Sarah over at my church.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.767
Now, I'll ask Sarah if the girl
said anything about her past.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.467
In the meantime...

22:48.533 --> 22:50.533
be patient.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.000
- Patient?

22:52.066 --> 22:54.567
Reverend, this thing is
gonna gnaw on me non-stop.

22:54.633 --> 22:57.700
I need to know if this baby
is really my grandchild,

22:57.767 --> 23:00.166
really my blood.

23:01.734 --> 23:03.934
- Why are you still
talking to Cloutier?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.333
- I gotta find out if Bennett's
telling the truth about Carrie.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.400
- And if the nigger's lying?

23:07.467 --> 23:08.900
- Oh, he's dead.

23:08.967 --> 23:11.700
I'll stick him myself, right
between his fucking banjo eyes.

23:14.200 --> 23:18.300
- James Robson hired
Leroy Tidd to assassinate me,

23:18.367 --> 23:20.834
but then when Leroy
converted to Islam...

23:22.367 --> 23:24.066
Became Salah Udeen.

23:24.133 --> 23:26.734
Robson had to hire Carl Jenkins
to finish the job.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.433
- Aah!

23:32.467 --> 23:34.400
- No!

23:34.467 --> 23:36.233
He died saving me.

23:36.300 --> 23:38.100
- And Jenkins is on trial
for the murder.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.100
- But not Robson.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.433
- There's only person that can
corroborate your theory,

23:42.500 --> 23:43.800
and that's Jenkins.

23:43.867 --> 23:46.033
He ain't gonna squeal
on a fellow Nazi.

23:46.100 --> 23:49.066
- I know how to turn
Jenkins around.

23:49.133 --> 23:50.867
You let me speak to the boy.

23:50.934 --> 23:51.867
- No.

23:51.934 --> 23:53.533
You face to face with Jenkins

23:53.600 --> 23:55.033
will only set off
another race war.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.367
I pass.

23:56.433 --> 23:58.834
- Glynn, you just do
what you always do...

24:00.233 --> 24:01.567
Nothing.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.967
May we speak alone?

24:18.433 --> 24:20.433
- What's on your mind?

24:20.500 --> 24:22.066
- I've been watching you.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.533
I believe you to be
a man of God,

24:25.600 --> 24:27.433
true to your faith,

24:27.500 --> 24:29.734
that you believe
in justice.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.166
- I do.

24:32.233 --> 24:35.300
- Then I have a favor to ask.

24:51.867 --> 24:53.633
- You here to kill me?

24:53.700 --> 24:55.000
- No.

24:58.467 --> 25:00.066
To help.

25:00.133 --> 25:01.867
To save your soul.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.266
- Jenkins gave you up.

25:03.333 --> 25:06.066
He pinned Leroy Tidd's
murder on you.

25:06.133 --> 25:07.133
- What'd you do,

25:07.200 --> 25:08.333
beat a confession
out of him?

25:08.400 --> 25:09.533
- You're going down,
Robson.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.834
- It's his word against mine.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.567
- You're gonna fry.

25:12.633 --> 25:15.567
- It's his motherfucking,
cocksucking word against mine.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.066
- Thanks, Vern.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.500
- Carl.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.867
This is for you.

25:37.934 --> 25:40.266
From your friends
in the brotherhood.

26:25.767 --> 26:26.934
- Is there a problem?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.233
- You've been a comfort
to me, Reverend.

26:29.300 --> 26:31.333
So I'm gonna let you live.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.900
But don't you ever
meddle in the affairs

26:34.967 --> 26:37.033
of the brotherhood again.

26:37.100 --> 26:39.333
- Vern...
- "And I will pour out

26:39.400 --> 26:42.300
"mine indignation upon thee.

26:42.367 --> 26:46.033
"I will blow against thee
in the fire of my wrath

26:46.100 --> 26:49.333
"and deliver thee into
the hand of brutish men

26:49.400 --> 26:52.033
and skillful to destroy."

27:07.834 --> 27:09.367
- Hey, what's up, half-dick?

27:09.433 --> 27:10.367
- Fucking Mick!

27:10.433 --> 27:11.900
- Hey, hey!
- Fuck!

27:11.967 --> 27:13.333
- Get in there.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.000
- Here you go, Alvarez.

27:16.066 --> 27:17.900
- Stupid fuck.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.800
Hey, Smith.

27:30.867 --> 27:31.934
- Yeah?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.233
- Jenkins don't
look so hot, man.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.967
- What do you mean?

27:40.100 --> 27:42.800
Oh, fuck.

27:42.867 --> 27:45.333
- Guess he won't be
eating his chicken nuggets.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.066
- Ah.

28:06.767 --> 28:08.767
- Oh, shit!

28:08.834 --> 28:09.767
Bailey!

28:11.867 --> 28:14.567
You get on the other phone
in there and call pest control.

28:14.633 --> 28:16.700
I'm sick of sharing my cell
with Mickey and the other rats.

28:16.767 --> 28:18.734
- Mickey is a mouse.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.700
- I'm serious,
God damn it!

28:29.033 --> 28:31.200
- Your shot's off.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.400
- There's nothing wrong
with my shot.

28:33.467 --> 28:34.433
- No, it's off.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.433
There's no follow-through.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.433
- Give me the ball back.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.500
- Watch, see?

28:37.567 --> 28:38.834
That's follow-through.

28:45.033 --> 28:46.166
- That's follow-through.

28:46.233 --> 28:47.800
- Yeah,
come to think of it,

28:47.867 --> 28:50.834
your jump shot was pretty
erratic before you got to Oz.

28:50.900 --> 28:52.200
- Erratic, my ass.

28:52.266 --> 28:54.266
See that last game
I played?

28:54.333 --> 28:56.734
Shit,
I busted the Bulls for 55.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.066
- Yeah, if I remember right,
your team lost that night.

29:00.133 --> 29:02.266
- Well,
I had no supporting cast.

29:02.333 --> 29:04.767
- It seemed to me that
you were being too selfish.

29:04.834 --> 29:06.100
- You and every other

29:06.166 --> 29:07.400
"come to the game,
live your dreams through me"

29:07.467 --> 29:08.400
motherfuckers.

29:08.467 --> 29:10.066
- Hey, I played.

29:10.133 --> 29:12.233
I mean,
I didn't have your gifts, but...

29:12.300 --> 29:13.567
my teams won.

29:13.633 --> 29:15.000
- White boy city league?

29:15.066 --> 29:17.266
That ain't exactly the NBA.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.834
- Hey, winning's winning.

29:20.900 --> 29:23.200
You either know
how to win or you don't.

29:23.266 --> 29:25.367
It's just in a guy.

29:25.433 --> 29:28.400
- So, you're saying if you
and I played, you'd beat me?

29:28.467 --> 29:31.300
- Under the right circumstances,
ball bounces the right way,

29:31.367 --> 29:32.567
who knows?

29:32.633 --> 29:34.533
- No circumstances
are you beating me.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.433
Shit, I spot you nine
in a game of ten,

29:36.500 --> 29:38.533
I'd beat you 10-9
every time.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.567
I could take the sorriest
motherfucker in this prison

29:40.633 --> 29:42.333
and you take the best,

29:42.400 --> 29:44.834
and I'd still clown
your broke-down,

29:44.900 --> 29:47.000
pushing 50 junkyard ass.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.400
- Well, let's do it.

29:49.467 --> 29:50.834
- Do what?

29:50.900 --> 29:54.400
- You take the worst inmate,
I'll find the best C.O.,

29:54.467 --> 29:56.533
play a little two-on-two.

29:58.767 --> 29:59.834
- You're serious.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.934
- As I stand here.

30:02.033 --> 30:04.133
- You're gonna be pissed
if I say no.

30:05.834 --> 30:06.767
I say no.

30:06.834 --> 30:08.834
- Yeah?
Fuck you.

30:08.900 --> 30:11.367
- If you think about it,
it's really fuck you.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.533
- Hey, hey!

30:16.600 --> 30:20.433
You say yes, I'll bring
you back to Em City.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.200
- Basketball tournament?

30:30.266 --> 30:31.600
- More of an exhibition match.

30:31.667 --> 30:32.600
Best of three games.

30:32.667 --> 30:33.734
- Here we go again.

30:33.800 --> 30:34.834
- What's that supposed to mean?

30:34.900 --> 30:36.033
- What if something goes wrong?

30:36.100 --> 30:37.667
- Nothing's gonna go wrong.

30:37.734 --> 30:40.233
- And that's what you said about
the boxing and Hamid Khan died.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.934
- Basketball isn't boxing.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.734
- I'm more concerned
with crowd control.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.734
The gym won't accommodate
the same amount of prisoners

30:45.800 --> 30:47.033
we had attend the fights.

30:47.100 --> 30:48.767
- So, we limit the numbers.

30:48.834 --> 30:51.934
Make good behavior
the price of admission.

30:53.533 --> 30:55.233
- All right.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.600
That's all.

31:02.967 --> 31:04.333
- I need a teammate.

31:06.333 --> 31:07.700
You're looking at
the wrong guy.

31:07.767 --> 31:09.100
- Oh, come on, Leo.

31:09.166 --> 31:10.433
You love basketball.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.867
- Yeah, I love basketball,

31:11.934 --> 31:13.734
but I'm not about to go
against Jackson Vahue.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.233
- Leo, together I think we--

31:15.300 --> 31:16.400
- No, Tim.

31:16.467 --> 31:17.667
Find another sap.

31:17.734 --> 31:19.834
This one is staying
on the sidelines.

31:27.066 --> 31:28.400
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:28.467 --> 31:30.800
- I need you to play with me
in the game against Vahue.

31:30.867 --> 31:33.800
- Thanks, but, you know,
I don't think so.

31:33.867 --> 31:36.033
- Hey, you're my guy,
I need you.

31:36.100 --> 31:39.266
- Tim, look, I...

31:39.333 --> 31:41.767
I really think
you should call this game off.

31:41.834 --> 31:42.800
- What?

31:42.867 --> 31:44.066
- This is bad for us, man.

31:44.133 --> 31:45.867
I mean, it ain't
just you out there.

31:45.934 --> 31:48.567
All of us hacks are gonna
take a tremendous amount of shit

31:48.633 --> 31:50.100
when you lose.

31:50.166 --> 31:51.567
- Well, who knows?
We might win.

31:51.633 --> 31:52.734
- You're not gonna win.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.567
You're gonna get
your ass kicked!

31:54.633 --> 31:57.467
- Look, if I can get the space
to get my shot off,

31:57.533 --> 31:58.900
I can score.

31:58.967 --> 32:01.266
And you used to be
all-state in high school.

32:01.333 --> 32:02.667
- That was 20 years ago,

32:02.734 --> 32:04.600
and you just got out of
the fucking hospital.

32:04.667 --> 32:05.600
I'm not playing.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.567
- Oh, fine,
go fuck yourself.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.000
- Jesus, Tim.

32:09.066 --> 32:11.633
You know, you can be such
an asshole sometimes.

32:11.700 --> 32:12.967
- What's the matter?

32:13.033 --> 32:14.900
Timmy can't find anybody
to throw the ball to?

32:35.066 --> 32:36.767
- Dave.

32:36.834 --> 32:39.700
Hey.
Looks like you're a player.

32:39.767 --> 32:40.967
You're good.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.700
- Oh, yeah?

32:44.734 --> 32:46.400
- All right.

32:46.467 --> 32:47.700
You're better than good.

32:47.767 --> 32:49.233
Did you play
in college?

32:49.300 --> 32:50.567
- Juco.

32:50.633 --> 32:53.633
Had two good years
at a school upstate.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.900
- You didn't go on
to a four-year program?

32:55.967 --> 32:57.133
- No, I did.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.567
University of Iowa.

32:59.633 --> 33:01.166
But I had to drop out.

33:01.233 --> 33:03.333
- Ah.
Grades?

33:09.300 --> 33:12.467
- Got caught scalping my
player comps to football games.

33:12.533 --> 33:15.266
You know, any mini move
bullshit I could think of.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.834
Upside was, I was never
charged for any of it.

33:17.900 --> 33:20.633
- Yeah, but the school was still
forced to run you off, huh?

33:20.700 --> 33:22.000
- Yeah.

33:22.066 --> 33:23.300
I guess
in my heart of hearts

33:23.367 --> 33:26.000
I knew I wouldn't have
lasted there anyway.

33:26.066 --> 33:27.834
- Listen, uh...

33:29.533 --> 33:32.266
I challenged Jackson Vahue
to some two-on-two.

33:32.333 --> 33:33.467
- I heard.

33:33.533 --> 33:36.000
- So you want to be
my running mate?

33:36.066 --> 33:37.900
- Go head to head with Vahue?

33:37.967 --> 33:39.033
- Yeah.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.667
- That'd be a dream.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.800
- You wanted to see me?

33:44.867 --> 33:46.033
- Busmalis, come in.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.433
- Sit?
- Stand.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.934
You play basketball?

33:49.000 --> 33:50.300
- No.

33:50.367 --> 33:52.266
- How about when
you were younger?

33:52.333 --> 33:53.367
- No.

33:53.433 --> 33:54.467
- Any sports at all?

33:54.533 --> 33:55.600
- Nah.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.066
I was the guy
with the towel.

33:58.133 --> 34:00.066
- Go introduce yourself
to Jackson Vahue.

34:00.133 --> 34:01.667
You're his new teammate.

34:23.867 --> 34:26.767
- As you all know, this is
the best of a three-game series,

34:26.834 --> 34:28.300
and due to the fact
that our court is

34:28.367 --> 34:29.867
smaller than
regulation size,

34:29.934 --> 34:32.033
the games will run
full court.

34:32.100 --> 34:34.233
We'll set the clock,
20 minutes.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.300
Each team will be
given one timeout,

34:36.367 --> 34:39.233
and the three-point line
is in effect.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.033
All right,
let's hoop it up.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.934
Airball! Airball! Airball!

35:56.800 --> 36:00.367
Vahue! Vahue! Vahue!

36:05.333 --> 36:07.000
all: ♪ Na, na, na, na ♪

36:07.066 --> 36:09.266
♪ Na, na, na, na ♪

36:09.333 --> 36:12.967
♪ Hey, hey, hey,
good-bye ♪

36:19.467 --> 36:20.667
- The court has set
next Thursday

36:20.734 --> 36:22.400
as the date of
your execution.

36:22.467 --> 36:26.300
Have you decided
how you want to die?

36:26.367 --> 36:28.600
- I'm not like
my buddy Giles over there.

36:28.667 --> 36:29.734
I'm not...

36:29.800 --> 36:31.333
I'm not going for
anything flashy

36:31.400 --> 36:33.200
like being stoned to death.

36:33.266 --> 36:35.900
Lethal injection will
suit me just fine, sir.

36:35.967 --> 36:37.200
- Good.

36:37.266 --> 36:40.200
- I've contacted
the Organ Donor Association

36:40.266 --> 36:43.233
regarding your willingness
to donate your organs

36:43.300 --> 36:44.500
to people in need.

36:44.567 --> 36:47.934
They were thrilled
by your generosity.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.300
- Well, plenty of folks
are gonna be thrilled

36:50.367 --> 36:51.967
to see me breathe my last.

36:52.033 --> 36:54.467
- The association was resistant
to having you meet with those

36:54.533 --> 36:56.834
who would be receiving
your organs,

36:56.900 --> 36:59.367
but after a little
gentle persuasion,

36:59.433 --> 37:01.433
they have agreed.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.200
But only as long as
the patient does.

37:03.266 --> 37:04.233
- Well, that's fair.

37:04.300 --> 37:05.834
- One already has.

37:05.900 --> 37:08.533
Tomorrow morning, you meet
with one Jiffy Karas.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.100
- Who's that?

37:10.166 --> 37:11.567
- A blind man.

37:11.633 --> 37:15.166
And your corneas will help
restore his sight.

37:18.133 --> 37:19.600
- Oh, don't get up.

37:19.667 --> 37:21.400
I'm Jiffy Karas.

37:21.467 --> 37:24.433
Don't ask why
my dad named me Jiffy.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.467
- Moses Deyell.

37:29.533 --> 37:32.166
- Ah, my hero.

37:32.233 --> 37:34.867
- Nobody's ever
called me a hero before.

37:34.934 --> 37:37.000
- Well, that's what you are.

37:37.066 --> 37:40.300
My children's children
will sing your praises.

37:40.367 --> 37:42.500
- You been blind
all your life?

37:42.567 --> 37:44.467
- No.

37:44.533 --> 37:46.567
Lost my sight
two years ago.

37:46.633 --> 37:48.266
Oh, but thanks to you,

37:48.333 --> 37:52.467
I'll be able to see the faces
of my children again.

37:52.533 --> 37:55.900
- Well, I'm glad my death
could bring about some good.

37:55.967 --> 37:59.800
- Mr. Deyell, would you mind
if I touched you?

37:59.867 --> 38:01.066
- Touch me?

38:01.133 --> 38:02.467
- Your face.

38:02.533 --> 38:05.333
I want to remember
exactly what you look like.

38:07.333 --> 38:09.133
- Yeah, sure.

38:17.967 --> 38:20.066
- All right, Deyell,
we're shipping you over

38:20.133 --> 38:22.633
to Benchley Memorial so that
the transplant doctors there

38:22.700 --> 38:25.900
can do whatever tests
they need to do before Thursday.

38:25.967 --> 38:28.000
- You'll also be meeting
a Deborah Becker,

38:28.066 --> 38:29.767
a 20-year-old
social science major.

38:29.834 --> 38:31.467
She'll be...

38:31.533 --> 38:33.467
receiving your heart.

38:35.533 --> 38:38.667
- You know what's
so crazy about this?

38:38.734 --> 38:42.033
On the brink of my demise,
I feel more alive than ever,

38:42.100 --> 38:44.567
like I got more reason to live.

38:44.633 --> 38:46.233
- Take him out.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.200
- So long, Said.

39:01.433 --> 39:02.734
- Funny.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.467
He said "so long" like
he was never coming back.

39:09.467 --> 39:13.500
- You're gonna risk it all
and go for the $1 million?

39:13.567 --> 39:15.133
- Absolutely,
I feel lucky.

39:15.200 --> 39:19.934
- What is the capital city
of Burkina Faso?

39:20.000 --> 39:21.500
Any idea?

39:21.567 --> 39:24.600
- Uh...Burkina Faso City?

39:24.667 --> 39:26.266
- No, I need either
a hint or a...

39:26.333 --> 39:28.734
- What's the answer,
Beecher?

39:28.800 --> 39:31.200
- I do not have
a fucking clue.

39:31.266 --> 39:33.934
- I dated a girl
named Burkina Faso.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.467
- And the capital of
Upper Volta is Ouagagoudou.

39:36.533 --> 39:37.633
- Are you sure?

39:37.700 --> 39:39.500
- I'm positive.
Ouagagoudou.

39:39.567 --> 39:41.433
- I'm sorry, John.

39:41.500 --> 39:44.500
The answer
is Ouagadougou.

39:44.567 --> 39:46.367
Ouagagoudou is wrong.

39:46.433 --> 39:47.400
- Oh, you've got to be--
- I know.

39:47.467 --> 39:48.700
- We interrupt this program

39:48.767 --> 39:50.033
to bring you
a special news bulletin.

39:50.100 --> 39:51.900
- WYAT has just received word

39:51.967 --> 39:54.066
that convicted murderer
Moses Deyell

39:54.133 --> 39:56.533
has died in
an attempted escape

39:56.600 --> 39:58.567
while being temporarily
transferred from

39:58.633 --> 40:01.834
the Oswald Correctional Facility
to Benchley Memorial Hospital.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.467
Deyell, who had decided
to donate his organs

40:04.533 --> 40:06.033
immediately after
his execution,

40:06.100 --> 40:08.734
was being transported in a van
when he apparently

40:08.800 --> 40:10.367
leapt out of
the moving vehicle.

40:10.433 --> 40:13.867
We'll have more details
on this story as it develops.

40:42.166 --> 40:45.100
- So,
Orpheus returns to Earth...

40:45.166 --> 40:47.533
alone, sad...

40:47.600 --> 40:49.433
and what happens?

40:49.500 --> 40:50.967
Do the townspeople
console him?

40:51.033 --> 40:52.567
Fuck no.

40:52.633 --> 40:56.500
They blame him for his failure
and tear him to bits, literally.

40:56.567 --> 40:58.934
Then they throw his organs
in the river.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.633
All this 'cause
he let his family down,

41:01.700 --> 41:05.300
'cause he took one last look
at someone he loved.

41:05.367 --> 41:07.800
The gods don't
have a sentimental bone

41:07.867 --> 41:09.800
in their bodies.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.934
Prisoner number 0-1-C-9-7-2,

41:19.000 --> 41:20.867
Padraic Connelly,

41:20.934 --> 41:24.633
arrested
February 28th, 2001.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.300
Illegal entry into
the United States.

41:27.367 --> 41:30.667
Being held
pending deportation.

41:30.734 --> 41:32.166
- Padraic Connelly is here?

41:32.233 --> 41:34.266
- Came in this morning.

41:34.333 --> 41:35.900
You knew about Connelly?

41:35.967 --> 41:37.033
- Yeah, from the papers.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.333
Member of the IRA,

41:38.400 --> 41:40.567
British government
wants to extradite him

41:40.633 --> 41:43.834
for his involvement in
the death of a British soldier.

41:43.900 --> 41:46.100
A few days ago, the court
ruled in Connelly's favor,

41:46.166 --> 41:47.300
they granted him asylum.

41:47.367 --> 41:49.333
- The I.N.S.
appealed the decision.

41:49.400 --> 41:52.867
Connelly's been sent here
to wait out the legal battle.

41:52.934 --> 41:54.500
- Why isn't he in
a federal prison?

41:54.567 --> 41:56.633
- He was, but kept
getting death threats.

41:56.700 --> 41:59.200
Almost got himself murdered
by a protestant sympathizer,

41:59.266 --> 42:00.767
so our friends over
at the State Department

42:00.834 --> 42:03.533
asked if we could
hide him in Oz.

42:03.600 --> 42:05.333
- Put Connelly in Em City.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.667
- Why?

42:06.734 --> 42:07.900
- Why not?

42:09.967 --> 42:13.133
You just want him there so
you can study his every move.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.533
- A genuine terrorist?

42:15.600 --> 42:18.033
I admit, I'm intrigued.

42:18.100 --> 42:21.633
- Okay.
He's yours.

42:21.700 --> 42:23.400
God help you both.

42:32.233 --> 42:34.033
- Padraic, I'm Tim McManus.

42:34.100 --> 42:35.834
I'm unit manager of Em City.

42:39.867 --> 42:42.033
Uh, have a seat.

42:46.266 --> 42:48.166
I've been following
your situation,

42:48.233 --> 42:50.533
and so I know how
fucked up it is.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.233
So I took the liberty of
calling your lawyer

42:52.300 --> 42:54.100
and I got some
pretty good news.

42:54.166 --> 42:57.100
It doesn't seem like
you're gonna be here long.

42:57.166 --> 42:59.400
Since you're litigating
to stay in the U.S.,

42:59.467 --> 43:03.066
it's presumable you
don't pose any flight risk,

43:03.133 --> 43:05.700
so your lawyer feels
that with the judge

43:05.767 --> 43:07.567
already sympathetic
to your cause,

43:07.633 --> 43:10.233
along with the support of
human rights groups,

43:10.300 --> 43:13.133
bail's gonna get set.

43:15.633 --> 43:17.266
- That is good news.

43:19.367 --> 43:21.233
May I go now?

43:23.166 --> 43:25.200
- Uh, yeah.

43:25.266 --> 43:26.633
Yeah, sure.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.433
- Who's he?

43:46.500 --> 43:48.166
- It's Padraic Connelly.

43:48.233 --> 43:49.934
- That's all we need
in this place.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.200
Another dumb fucking
spud-eating Mick.

43:56.533 --> 43:57.934
- Hey, Ryan O'Reily.
- Stand back.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.333
- Huh?
- In the doorway.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.066
- No, I just came--
- Stand back.

44:02.133 --> 44:03.066
- All right.

44:03.133 --> 44:04.133
I like that, Padraic.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.800
You're a soldier,
you're cautious.

44:05.867 --> 44:07.834
This is good.

44:12.100 --> 44:13.467
- How do you know me name?

44:13.533 --> 44:15.867
- Oh, on the TV,
past couple of days,

44:15.934 --> 44:17.834
nothing but you and the IRA

44:17.900 --> 44:20.967
executing that British limey
commando officer fuck thing.

44:21.033 --> 44:23.166
- That was on the telly, that
we executed Captain Hurley?

44:23.233 --> 44:24.467
- Yeah.

44:24.533 --> 44:26.367
- That's not what happened.

44:26.433 --> 44:28.800
- Well, hey, it doesn't
matter what happened.

44:28.867 --> 44:30.967
That's what the guys in here
think happened.

44:31.033 --> 44:33.367
And believe me, that's
a good one for the both of us.

44:33.433 --> 44:36.066
- Mr. O'Reily, I've no need
for what you're selling.

44:36.133 --> 44:37.934
- You know, Padraic,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.200
you're starting
to piss me off,

44:40.266 --> 44:42.367
so I'm just gonna
say this once...

44:43.633 --> 44:45.867
You best start treating Oz
like a North Ireland,

44:45.934 --> 44:49.166
because in here,
you walk, talk, sleep,

44:49.233 --> 44:51.500
work, eat, shit, and drink

44:51.567 --> 44:52.600
with your own kind.

44:52.667 --> 44:55.133
You fucking understand me?

44:55.200 --> 44:58.166
- Because your name's O'Reily,
you're one of my kind?

44:58.233 --> 45:01.367
- We got the same color green
running through our veins, bro.

45:01.433 --> 45:03.033
- If that were true,
it wouldn't matter to you.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.033
- What wouldn't matter?

45:05.100 --> 45:07.767
- There was no execution.

45:07.834 --> 45:09.767
- You should be looking at me.

45:09.834 --> 45:11.467
We're being watched.

45:11.533 --> 45:13.266
- Watched?

45:13.333 --> 45:16.800
- I walk out of here,
and on body language alone

45:16.867 --> 45:19.867
everyone's gonna know what's
what between the two of us.

45:26.600 --> 45:29.000
- I won't be here long enough
to need your friendship,

45:29.066 --> 45:31.100
so have a good walk.

45:50.233 --> 45:52.300
- Connelly?

45:52.367 --> 45:55.133
I'm Timmy Kirk.
This is Jim Burns.

45:55.200 --> 45:57.066
- Why should I care
what your names are?

45:57.133 --> 45:58.700
- We're inviting you
to a bible study

45:58.767 --> 46:01.367
that the Reverend Cloutier
is holding this afternoon.

46:01.433 --> 46:02.400
- Cloutier?

46:02.467 --> 46:03.600
Who's Cloutier?

46:03.667 --> 46:06.700
- Today's your
conversion day, Padraic.

46:06.767 --> 46:08.333
Well, either that,

46:08.400 --> 46:11.333
or we beat the cat lick
right off you.

46:11.400 --> 46:12.900
Your choice.

46:16.567 --> 46:19.033
- Fucker.

46:24.633 --> 46:27.700
- Shit.
Burns, Burns, off.

46:27.767 --> 46:29.934
- What's wrong, boys?
Let's not stop now.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.533
- All right.

46:31.600 --> 46:32.967
Who started it?

46:33.033 --> 46:34.567
- We're only boxing.

46:34.633 --> 46:36.000
- Yeah, without gloves?

46:36.066 --> 46:38.400
- He speaks the truth.
Only boxing, sir.

46:38.467 --> 46:39.934
I was demonstrating
the techniques of

46:40.000 --> 46:42.400
the great John L. Sullivan.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.633
- All right, you two get
the fuck out of here.

46:48.700 --> 46:50.633
Listen, Padraic,

46:50.700 --> 46:53.834
if you want me to put you
in protective custody, I will.

46:53.900 --> 46:56.533
- Sounds very confining.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.033
No, thank you.

47:04.567 --> 47:07.333
Mr. Zelman, what's wrong?

47:07.400 --> 47:09.266
- Uh, sit down, son.

47:09.333 --> 47:11.233
- The bail hearing not happen?

47:11.300 --> 47:13.467
- No, no, it happened,
and it was all set,

47:13.533 --> 47:15.166
but here, take a look.

47:15.233 --> 47:17.066
That's a letter
from the Justice Department,

47:17.133 --> 47:19.900
specifically urging the court
to deny you bail.

47:19.967 --> 47:22.767
- Fucking Christ.

47:22.834 --> 47:24.967
So now what?

47:25.033 --> 47:27.767
- Well, I'm afraid this appeal
may play out all the way

47:27.834 --> 47:29.400
to the Supreme Court.

47:29.467 --> 47:33.367
The fact is, you may be stuck
in Oz for a very long time.

47:40.967 --> 47:42.700
- Did he--did he beat you?

47:42.767 --> 47:44.166
- What?

47:44.233 --> 47:45.867
- Dad, did he beat you?

47:45.934 --> 47:47.200
Is--is that why you left?

47:47.266 --> 47:48.700
- No.

47:48.767 --> 47:50.834
- He cheated on you?

47:50.900 --> 47:54.433
- I was barely 17
and the world was new

47:54.500 --> 47:56.934
and there were people to see

47:57.000 --> 47:58.934
and places to explore and...

47:59.000 --> 48:01.233
- So it was you
who cheated on him?

48:01.300 --> 48:05.567
- I guess...in a way.

48:05.633 --> 48:09.033
- I hate him, you know?

48:09.100 --> 48:12.333
And I would never blame you
for leaving that son of a bitch,

48:12.400 --> 48:14.400
but what I don't get is...

48:14.467 --> 48:17.166
is--fuck, Jesus,
didn't you even just...

48:17.233 --> 48:19.400
- Miss you?

48:19.467 --> 48:20.834
- Yeah.

48:23.233 --> 48:26.767
- Ryan, from the night
we made you till the day I left,

48:26.834 --> 48:30.934
you are the only real happiness
I have ever had.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.333
I just didn't know that then.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.633
I was a child with
a three-month-old.

48:35.700 --> 48:39.200
It didn't even occur to me
that I'd never see you again.

48:39.266 --> 48:42.734
It's just how things
had to work out.

48:42.800 --> 48:45.867
- No, you...
you're thinking of Cyril.

48:45.934 --> 48:47.133
- What?

48:47.200 --> 48:48.934
- You said "three months."

48:49.000 --> 48:50.500
Cyril would've been the baby.

48:50.567 --> 48:52.800
- No, Ryan,
you were the baby.

48:52.867 --> 48:54.400
- But I'm a year and a half
older than Cyril.

48:54.467 --> 48:58.000
- Your father and I
didn't have Cyril.

48:58.066 --> 49:00.100
- What are you talking about?

49:02.100 --> 49:03.867
Cyril's your half-brother.

49:12.600 --> 49:15.934
- Hey, Cyril,
you remember that one time

49:16.000 --> 49:19.967
when Dad made us go spend
the summer in Indiana

49:20.033 --> 49:21.767
on Uncle Bill's farm?

49:23.700 --> 49:27.033
It was you, me, and those
three neighbor kids

49:27.100 --> 49:30.333
in the fields walking beans,

49:30.400 --> 49:33.166
and Uncle Bill had
made me the foreman

49:33.233 --> 49:35.233
and those three kids
decided to quit

49:35.300 --> 49:38.600
because they thought
I was yelling too much.

49:38.667 --> 49:42.266
I think they wanted to go
swimming or something like that,

49:42.333 --> 49:45.934
and they wanted to
take you with them.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.500
But instead...

49:48.567 --> 49:52.600
you decided to stay
with me in the fields

49:52.667 --> 49:54.900
until we were finished.

49:56.834 --> 50:00.033
I've always wondered,

50:00.100 --> 50:03.633
did you stay with me
'cause we're brothers...

50:05.800 --> 50:08.266
Or did you stay
'cause you thought

50:08.333 --> 50:11.567
that if you tried to leave
I'd beat you up?

50:22.333 --> 50:24.033
- One, two, three, four.

50:24.100 --> 50:25.467
Up, one, two, three,
come on.

50:25.533 --> 50:28.934
- All that time in the cage,
I never got to exercise.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.800
Not enough room to move.

50:30.867 --> 50:32.166
- Hey, Jia, you know we're
trying to work out here, man.

50:32.233 --> 50:33.166
You want to shut the fuck up?

50:33.233 --> 50:34.166
- I want to try that.

50:34.233 --> 50:35.533
- No, stop.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.533
- Cyril, you know, I could
teach you a lot of things

50:38.600 --> 50:40.433
better than
that bullshit boxing.

50:40.500 --> 50:41.600
- I want to learn.

50:41.667 --> 50:42.967
- Okay.

50:43.033 --> 50:45.467
There's this.

50:45.533 --> 50:47.166
- Hey, motherfucker!

50:53.467 --> 50:54.900
No, Cyril, back!

50:54.967 --> 50:57.800
Back!
- He hit you, he hit you!

50:57.867 --> 50:59.266
He hit you!
He hit you!

50:59.333 --> 51:00.934
- Cyril, back, back!

51:01.000 --> 51:02.333
- No!

51:02.400 --> 51:03.900
- Oh, fuck.

51:06.867 --> 51:08.000
- Well?

51:08.066 --> 51:09.500
- Jia's in a coma.

51:09.567 --> 51:11.166
We sent him over
to Benchley Memorial,

51:11.233 --> 51:14.367
but I have no idea
when or if he'll wake up.

51:14.433 --> 51:16.400
- Another knockout
for Cyril O'Reily.

51:16.467 --> 51:18.033
- Jia provoked Cyril.

51:18.100 --> 51:19.467
- So says his brother.

51:19.533 --> 51:23.000
But Ryan O'Reily isn't exactly
trustworthy or unbiased.

51:23.066 --> 51:24.300
- What are you saying?

51:24.367 --> 51:26.400
- Well, we've put off
this decision long enough.

51:26.467 --> 51:29.166
I think we should ship Cyril
to the Conley Institute.

51:29.233 --> 51:31.367
- No, I think that would be
a tragic mistake.

51:31.433 --> 51:32.834
- For who?

51:32.900 --> 51:35.100
- Cyril's brother is his only
lifeline to reality.

51:35.166 --> 51:37.934
We separate them, the guy's
gonna spiral into lunacy.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.266
- Yeah, we keep him here,
he gets into more fights,

51:40.333 --> 51:41.767
maybe puts somebody else
in a coma.

51:41.834 --> 51:43.467
I think we should
transfer him out today.

51:43.533 --> 51:44.500
- You're being cruel.

51:44.567 --> 51:46.300
- Rather cruel than blind.

51:46.367 --> 51:48.266
- I have an alternative.

51:48.333 --> 51:51.000
Let's place Cyril in
protective custody for a while,

51:51.066 --> 51:53.934
allow Ryan regular visits,
and...

51:54.000 --> 51:56.166
see how Cyril adjusts.

51:56.233 --> 51:57.867
- That makes sense to me.

51:58.834 --> 51:59.867
- Tim?

51:59.934 --> 52:01.367
- Fine.

52:01.433 --> 52:02.600
As long as
he's out of my hair.

52:09.900 --> 52:11.800
- But I don't want to go.

52:11.867 --> 52:13.967
- Cyril...

52:14.033 --> 52:15.100
trust me.

52:15.166 --> 52:16.433
You have to.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.000
Because if you don't,

52:18.066 --> 52:20.600
they're gonna send you
far, far away from me,

52:20.667 --> 52:24.800
and you and I ain't gonna
see each other no more.

52:26.433 --> 52:27.367
- Hey.

52:27.433 --> 52:29.333
Come on.
Come on, man.

52:29.400 --> 52:30.533
It's okay.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.100
Come on, take your bag.

52:32.166 --> 52:33.567
Come on.

52:35.033 --> 52:36.834
Come on, let's go.

52:36.900 --> 52:38.533
Let's go.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.433
Hey, Cyril.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.767
Toughen up, all right?

52:49.834 --> 52:51.700
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Yeah?

52:51.767 --> 52:54.166
- Eliminating Jia?
I owe you.

52:59.767 --> 53:02.266
- You got a problem,
friend?

53:17.133 --> 53:19.200
- I have a confession to make.

53:21.433 --> 53:23.734
Several months ago,
I was heading into the gym.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.100
No one was there

53:25.166 --> 53:29.200
but Ryan O'Reily
and Patrick Keenan.

53:29.266 --> 53:30.367
- Aah!

53:34.600 --> 53:37.133
- Because I was so wrapped up
in my own failings,

53:37.200 --> 53:40.400
I just pushed
the incident aside,

53:40.467 --> 53:43.433
but every day,
every time I'm near O'Reily,

53:43.500 --> 53:45.200
I say to myself,
"Do something."

53:45.266 --> 53:47.800
- Do what, exactly?

53:47.867 --> 53:49.734
- Tell the authorities.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.166
The attack on Jia Kenmin
only proves

53:52.233 --> 53:55.333
that O'Reily will
continue hurting people.

53:57.133 --> 53:58.500
- Okay.

54:00.266 --> 54:02.400
We'll go to
Warden Glynn together.

54:02.467 --> 54:05.333
Because if O'Reily
finds out that you told...

54:07.433 --> 54:09.433
He'll kill you next.

54:11.734 --> 54:13.133
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

54:13.200 --> 54:15.000
Patrick Keenan was my friend.

54:15.066 --> 54:17.000
Whoever told you this bullshit

54:17.066 --> 54:18.333
must have it out for me.

54:18.400 --> 54:20.500
- The informant has
no motive to lie.

54:23.633 --> 54:26.767
- Look, Warden, when those
news people were here,

54:26.834 --> 54:29.633
they asked me all about
Adebisi's videotapes

54:29.700 --> 54:32.367
and I didn't say word one.

54:32.433 --> 54:33.567
- What?

54:33.633 --> 54:35.166
You're expecting
return of the favor?

54:35.233 --> 54:36.266
- Yeah.

54:36.333 --> 54:37.867
- Fuck you!

54:37.934 --> 54:39.900
I'm gonna thoroughly
investigate these charges.

54:39.967 --> 54:42.533
If I find
any corroborating evidence,

54:42.600 --> 54:44.133
you're going to death row.

54:44.200 --> 54:45.667
You got that?

54:50.133 --> 54:51.433
- What happened?

54:51.500 --> 54:53.600
- C.O. said he just collapsed.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.100
- Ryan, are you okay?

54:59.633 --> 55:01.367
- Yeah.

55:01.433 --> 55:03.867
I just--I just
needed to talk to you,

55:03.934 --> 55:05.500
so I faked falling down.

55:05.567 --> 55:06.700
- You scared the shit
out of me.

55:06.767 --> 55:08.467
- I'm sorry.

55:08.533 --> 55:09.667
- What's wrong?

55:09.734 --> 55:11.600
- We need privacy.

55:22.100 --> 55:24.066
You realize this is
the first time you and I

55:24.133 --> 55:25.367
have ever been alone?

55:25.433 --> 55:26.934
- I need to get
back out there, Ryan,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.967
so tell me what's so important.

55:30.467 --> 55:32.934
- Everything's turning
to shit, Gloria.

55:35.467 --> 55:37.700
There's a pretty good chance
that Cyril's gonna

55:37.767 --> 55:40.333
end up in a loony farm,

55:40.400 --> 55:42.200
and now there's a chance
I'm gonna be convicted

55:42.266 --> 55:43.767
for whacking Keenan.

55:43.834 --> 55:46.000
- What?
How?

55:46.066 --> 55:48.066
- Someone jabbered on me
to the warden.

55:48.133 --> 55:50.567
Hey, it wasn't you, was it?

55:50.633 --> 55:51.900
- No.

55:51.967 --> 55:54.166
- No, those eyes don't lie.

55:56.033 --> 55:57.300
- Go on.

55:57.367 --> 55:59.133
- I also hear there's
a sizable chance

55:59.200 --> 56:00.700
that you're gonna lose
your doctor's license,

56:00.767 --> 56:02.467
which means...

56:02.533 --> 56:05.533
I'll never see you again.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.500
- I know.

56:07.567 --> 56:11.066
- So, I have
a proposition to make.

56:11.133 --> 56:13.333
Don't answer me right away.

56:13.400 --> 56:14.834
I want you to take the time

56:14.900 --> 56:19.533
to really think about
what I'm asking.

56:21.834 --> 56:23.834
- Which is?

56:26.266 --> 56:28.367
- I want you to help

56:28.433 --> 56:30.800
Cyril and me escape.

56:36.667 --> 56:39.400
- Myths are supposed to
teach us something.

56:39.467 --> 56:43.433
But what's the life lesson
in this sad tale of Orpheus?

56:43.500 --> 56:46.600
No good deed
goes unpunished?

56:46.667 --> 56:48.700
Fuck that.

56:48.767 --> 56:50.934
Ain't no such thing
as a good deed.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.667
Love conquers all?

56:53.734 --> 56:58.033
Never has, never will.

56:58.100 --> 57:00.166
Maybe the moral of the story

57:00.233 --> 57:02.667
is that those in power are just
as fucked up as those who ain't,

57:02.734 --> 57:04.300
and the worst thing
a body can do is give up

57:04.367 --> 57:06.333
his or her own power
to some butt-heads

57:06.400 --> 57:07.600
on Mount Olympus,

57:07.667 --> 57:08.967
because if they're
so fucking powerful,

57:09.033 --> 57:10.433
how'd they let us get away
with all this shit

57:10.500 --> 57:12.800
in the first place?

57:12.867 --> 57:14.633
Answer me that.
