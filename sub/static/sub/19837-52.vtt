00:15.740 --> 00:18.760
<b><i>The remaining months gather to mourn.</i></b>

00:28.370 --> 00:31.240
<b><i>The mourners play a melody,</i></b>

00:31.910 --> 00:37.010
<b><i>while the eleventh moon quietly rises.</i></b>

01:57.010 --> 02:02.050
<b>Assault x And x Impact</b>

02:10.930 --> 02:12.900
<b><i>We will be making an emergency stop.</i></b>

02:12.900 --> 02:16.000
<b><i>Please watch your step.</i></b>

02:15.260 --> 02:16.920
<b>Did something happen?</b>

02:16.000 --> 02:19.070
<b><i>We are currently evaluating the situation.</i></b>

02:17.260 --> 02:18.340
<b>Beats me.</b>

02:22.260 --> 02:23.300
<b>It's me.</b>

02:24.010 --> 02:24.990
<b>Are they here?</b>

02:24.990 --> 02:26.540
<b>Yeah, it's gotta be them!</b>

02:28.190 --> 02:31.060
<b>They're the only ones strong enough to fight</b>

02:31.060 --> 02:32.750
<b>a whole crowd alone!</b>

02:34.820 --> 02:36.410
<b>Hey... Hey!</b>

02:37.350 --> 02:38.260
<b>Damn!</b>

02:38.470 --> 02:40.690
<b>Figure out how many enemies we're up against!</b>

02:40.690 --> 02:42.840
<b>Listen up! Do whatever 
it takes to stop them!</b>

02:42.840 --> 02:45.230
<b>Do not let them near this building!</b>

02:53.150 --> 02:54.430
<b>They're late...</b>

02:58.020 --> 02:59.870
<b>Our escort isn't here yet?</b>

02:59.870 --> 03:01.710
<b>Their names are Melody and Basho.</b>

03:02.200 --> 03:06.540
<b>All traffic in Yorknew City has been stopped.</b>

03:07.020 --> 03:08.790
<b>They're probably stuck.</b>

03:09.940 --> 03:12.180
<b>It's dangerous for Neon to be here!</b>

03:12.180 --> 03:14.720
<b>Isn't there any way to evacuate her?</b>

03:15.100 --> 03:18.800
<b>The ambulance we requested is on its way.</b>

03:18.800 --> 03:20.300
<b>Please wait a little longer.</b>

03:20.300 --> 03:21.710
<b>Ambulance?</b>

03:21.710 --> 03:23.530
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

03:23.990 --> 03:25.340
<b><i>Something's wrong here.</i></b>

03:25.340 --> 03:27.940
<b><i>The man who entered

03:27.940 --> 03:29.530
<b><i>and then called for a doctor...</i></b>

<b>Boss.</b>

03:32.550 --> 03:34.900
<b>Kurapika, don't take one step away</b>

<b>from my daughter until the ambulance arrives.</b>

03:37.130 --> 03:38.110
<b>Got it?</b>

03:38.110 --> 03:41.070
<b>But my assignment is to kill 
the Phantom Troupe.</b>

03:41.070 --> 03:44.340
<b>At the time, I thought that 
Neon would already be home.</b>

03:44.340 --> 03:46.700
<b>But instead, she's unconscious here,</b>

03:46.700 --> 03:49.040
<b>exposed to the Troupe.</b>

03:49.720 --> 03:52.140
<b>I absolutely must ensure Neon's safety.</b>

03:52.140 --> 03:53.890
<b>Stay here for the time being.</b>

03:54.480 --> 03:56.210
<b>I'm begging you.</b>

03:57.810 --> 03:59.260
<b>Understood.</b>

04:17.550 --> 04:19.620
<b>What a pity...</b>

04:19.620 --> 04:21.980
<b>They aren't putting up much of a fight.</b>

04:21.980 --> 04:24.790
<b>Well, I guess it was stupid to expect moreâ€”</b>

04:34.670 --> 04:35.910
<b>Damn...</b>

04:35.910 --> 04:37.760
<b>They're crazier than I've heard,</b>

04:37.760 --> 04:41.290
<b>launching a frontal attack with ten people.</b>

04:47.580 --> 04:49.190
<b>Man...</b>

04:49.190 --> 04:52.890
<b>When did this place turn into a battlefield?</b>

04:53.330 --> 04:55.480
<b>Where is the patient?</b>

04:58.130 --> 05:02.050
<b>There's nothing to prove that you 
aren't a Phantom Troupe member.</b>

05:02.050 --> 05:04.900
<b>One funny move, and I'll blow your head off.</b>

05:07.300 --> 05:08.390
<b>Follow me.</b>

05:12.860 --> 05:15.160
<b>Please allow me to check you all.</b>

05:15.160 --> 05:16.170
<b>What's that?</b>

05:18.510 --> 05:19.790
<b>Bastard...</b>

05:23.720 --> 05:28.000
<b><i>Currently, all trains have been stopped.</i></b>

05:28.450 --> 05:33.800
<b><i>For your safety, please wait patiently.</i></b>

05:35.750 --> 05:38.060
<b>I'm not getting any reception down here.</b>

05:38.580 --> 05:41.830
<b>And we don't know when the 
trains will start moving again.</b>

05:41.830 --> 05:44.190
<b>That settles it... We'll have to run.</b>

05:56.950 --> 05:59.230
<b>You were hired to be an assassin,</b>

05:59.230 --> 06:02.540
<b>so stop hiding in this room, and go fight.</b>

06:02.540 --> 06:05.420
<b>Or did you get scared once 
the Troupe showed up?</b>

06:06.090 --> 06:07.840
<b>Oh, actually...</b>

06:08.130 --> 06:10.740
<b>I requested that Kurapika stay here.</b>

06:11.160 --> 06:13.900
<b>I understand that he's been 
hired by the Ten Dons,</b>

06:13.900 --> 06:16.100
<b>but I was worried about my daughter.</b>

06:17.510 --> 06:19.500
<b>I don't intend to sell you out.</b>

06:19.500 --> 06:22.180
<b>But you're being paid well,</b>

06:22.180 --> 06:25.110
<b>so I expect you to do your job.</b>

06:28.190 --> 06:29.360
<b>I agree</b>

06:29.360 --> 06:32.220
<b>that I must do something.</b>

06:32.220 --> 06:34.740
<b>I could at least patrol this building.</b>

06:35.150 --> 06:36.400
<b>Yes, I suppose.</b>

06:36.950 --> 06:39.740
<b>But you must come immediately if I call.</b>

06:40.260 --> 06:42.430
<b>My daughter's safety comes first.</b>

06:42.430 --> 06:43.660
<b>Understood.</b>

06:44.890 --> 06:46.550
<b>How long do we have to wait?</b>

06:46.550 --> 06:49.010
<b>Hey, what's going on outside?</b>

06:49.010 --> 06:51.260
<b>I can hear explosions nearby!</b>

06:51.500 --> 06:53.410
<b>When will the auction start?</b>

06:53.410 --> 06:55.660
<b>Explain what's going on.</b>

06:55.660 --> 06:57.770
<b>P-Please wait a little longer.</b>

06:57.770 --> 07:00.270
<b>Tell us whether the auction's still on or not!</b>

07:01.420 --> 07:05.610
<b><i>Everyone here is a gang leader or a big shot.</i></b>

07:06.060 --> 07:10.280
<b><i>They're endangering themselves to prove</i></b>

07:10.280 --> 07:12.530
<b><i>that they aren't afraid of the Troupe.</i></b>

07:12.530 --> 07:14.210
<b>Return my phone!</b>

07:14.210 --> 07:16.080
<b>I've no idea what's happening outside.</b>

07:16.080 --> 07:18.260
<b>I need my weapons, too!</b>

07:18.260 --> 07:22.290
<b>As you already know, weapons are banned.</b>

07:22.480 --> 07:24.660
<b>What if they get inside?</b>

07:24.660 --> 07:27.050
<b>Are we supposed to fight with our bare hands?!</b>

07:27.390 --> 07:30.260
<b><i>It's becoming chaotic here...</i></b>

07:30.260 --> 07:33.670
<b><i>The auctioneers and handlers will lose control</i></b>

07:33.670 --> 07:36.420
<b><i>of the situation very soon.</i></b>

07:39.680 --> 07:40.670
<b>Hello?</b>

07:40.670 --> 07:42.060
<b>Oh, Kurapika?</b>

07:42.060 --> 07:42.810
<b>Huh?</b>

07:43.130 --> 07:45.700
<b>Whew, we finally got a hold of you.</b>

07:45.700 --> 07:46.510
<b>Is this Gon?!</b>

07:46.510 --> 07:48.330
<b>Yep, can you talk right now?</b>

07:48.330 --> 07:50.270
<b>Uh, sorry, I'm in the middle of something.</b>

07:50.270 --> 07:51.430
<b>I'll call you back.</b>

07:51.430 --> 07:52.520
<b>Wait!</b>

07:52.520 --> 07:53.810
<b>Can you give me one minute?</b>

07:53.810 --> 07:55.320
<b>I have something to tell you.</b>

07:55.680 --> 07:57.830
<b>Killua and I ran into the Troupe.</b>

07:58.620 --> 08:01.270
<b>Actually, they caught us.</b>

08:01.270 --> 08:03.330
<b>What were you guys thinking?!</b>

08:03.570 --> 08:06.910
<b>Do you realize how dangerous they are?</b>

08:07.310 --> 08:08.340
<b>Let me talk.</b>

08:09.020 --> 08:12.330
<b>I thought I knew, but after we met 
them, it became painfully clear.</b>

08:12.890 --> 08:14.880
<b>They're strong.</b>

08:14.880 --> 08:17.240
<b>Right now, we have no chance against them.</b>

08:17.650 --> 08:19.910
<b>That's why we need your assistance.</b>

08:19.910 --> 08:21.850
<b>We want to help.</b>

08:23.830 --> 08:25.250
<b>That's ridiculous.</b>

08:25.250 --> 08:28.210
<b>I won't help you get yourselves killed.</b>

08:28.210 --> 08:30.410
<b>Don't you want to know where their base is?</b>

08:30.880 --> 08:32.860
<b>I have my own sources of information.</b>

08:32.860 --> 08:35.940
<b>Do you know all of their powers?</b>

08:35.940 --> 08:39.240
<b>Enough! Just stay away from the Troupe!</b>

08:41.010 --> 08:44.890
<b>You're the chain user who killed 
one of their members, right?</b>

08:45.490 --> 08:47.750
<b>They're looking everywhere for you.</b>

08:48.300 --> 08:51.890
<b>If you won't treat us as friends or equals,</b>

08:51.890 --> 08:54.430
<b>we'll do whatever we must to help!</b>

08:57.590 --> 08:58.890
<b>Kurapika...</b>

08:59.170 --> 09:02.790
<b>One of their members cried in front of us.</b>

09:03.640 --> 09:06.620
<b>He said that he couldn't forgive 
whoever killed his friend.</b>

09:09.600 --> 09:13.650
<b>I got really mad after seeing that.</b>

09:14.190 --> 09:15.510
<b>I couldn't let that go.</b>

09:17.540 --> 09:19.740
<b>We want to stop them!</b>

09:21.630 --> 09:23.570
<b>Please, Kurapika...</b>

09:26.540 --> 09:28.640
<b>I'll call you back.</b>

09:33.860 --> 09:37.550
<b><i>If you won't treat us as friends or equals...</i></b>

09:38.210 --> 09:41.120
<b><i>We want to stop them!</i></b>

09:46.810 --> 09:47.780
<b>Here they come!</b>

09:47.260 --> 09:48.510
<b>Don't let them escape!</b>

09:48.050 --> 09:49.160
<b>I can feel the heat!</b>

09:49.170 --> 09:50.300
<b>Someone's coming!</b>

09:49.750 --> 09:50.960
<b>Does he have a gun?</b>

09:50.600 --> 09:52.080
<b>Who's stationed here?</b>

09:52.080 --> 09:53.820
<b>I-It's no use.</b>

09:53.820 --> 09:55.960
<b>They're too strong.</b>

09:56.520 --> 09:59.790
<b>We don't stand a chance...</b>

10:00.770 --> 10:04.990
<b>How strong are they?!</b>

10:06.510 --> 10:08.790
<b>This strong!</b>

10:13.020 --> 10:14.090
<b>Damn it!</b>

10:22.250 --> 10:24.580
<b>Aw, he broke.</b>

10:25.100 --> 10:27.220
<b>I need to find my next machine.</b>

10:28.810 --> 10:29.890
<b>Are you okay?</b>

10:29.890 --> 10:32.610
<b>I found the corpse of one of the assassins!</b>

10:32.930 --> 10:35.840
<b>Someone's already inside the building!</b>

10:36.730 --> 10:37.990
<b><i>Damn it.</i></b>

10:50.370 --> 10:51.540
<b>It's hopeless!</b>

10:51.540 --> 10:52.470
<b>Hey, don't run away!</b>

10:52.470 --> 10:53.670
<b>Fight!</b>

11:06.830 --> 11:08.140
<b>Man, what's going on?</b>

11:08.630 --> 11:09.510
<b>It's me.</b>

11:09.510 --> 11:11.050
<b>Where's our backup?</b>

11:11.050 --> 11:12.120
<b>What are you doing?</b>

11:12.120 --> 11:14.300
<b>They should be there any moment.</b>

11:14.300 --> 11:15.910
<b>We'll be arriving shortly...</b>

11:24.720 --> 11:26.110
<b><i>You can't mean...</i></b>

11:26.110 --> 11:30.300
<b><i>The two thousand men that were 
supposed to assemble here</i></b>

11:31.490 --> 11:33.240
<b><i>have all been wiped out?</i></b>

11:35.790 --> 11:37.030
<b><i>Now what?</i></b>

11:37.030 --> 11:40.230
<b><i>There are Troupe members inside the building.</i></b>

11:43.050 --> 11:44.680
<b>It's me, Bean!</b>

11:45.130 --> 11:46.440
<b>Get the Ten Dons on the line.</b>

11:46.440 --> 11:47.680
<b>It's urgent!</b>

11:51.140 --> 11:54.080
<b><i>The intruder must be a member of the Troupe.</i></b>

11:54.080 --> 11:58.690
<b><i>Their objective is to steal the rest of the 
merchandise and avenge their comrade.</i></b>

11:59.120 --> 12:02.200
<b><i>He said that he couldn't forgive 
whoever killed his friend.</i></b>

12:03.340 --> 12:04.990
<b><i>That's what I wanted!</i></b>

12:07.550 --> 12:09.450
<b>Hey! Enough already!</b>

12:09.450 --> 12:12.970
<b>Give us the weapons we handed over!</b>

12:12.970 --> 12:15.250
<b>But the rules state that...</b>

12:15.250 --> 12:17.090
<b>To hell with the rules!</b>

12:17.090 --> 12:18.540
<b>Do you understand our situation?!</b>

12:18.540 --> 12:21.880
<b>I know you've got professional assassins</b>

12:21.880 --> 12:24.070
<b>wandering around this place!</b>

12:24.070 --> 12:25.930
<b>If you're gonna depend on those freaks,</b>

12:25.930 --> 12:27.720
<b>you might as well let us fight!</b>

12:33.740 --> 12:37.190
<b>My name is Zeno Zoldyck.</b>

12:38.820 --> 12:41.660
<b>The famous Zoldyck family of assassins!</b>

12:41.660 --> 12:44.780
<b>The Ten Dons called in these monsters?</b>

12:46.060 --> 12:50.030
<b>At the moment, one bandit has 
infiltrated this building.</b>

12:51.100 --> 12:54.160
<b>He has killed a number of the assassins</b>

12:54.160 --> 12:55.710
<b>that your people hired.</b>

13:00.790 --> 13:04.510
<b>Even if you were fully armed,</b>

13:04.510 --> 13:07.900
<b>it would take me seven seconds 
to kill the lot of you.</b>

13:08.430 --> 13:11.260
<b>The enemy is capable of a similar feat.</b>

13:12.620 --> 13:15.700
<b>If you understand, shut up and wait.</b>

13:15.700 --> 13:18.230
<b>It's a different story if you want to die...</b>

13:36.420 --> 13:37.540
<b>Well?</b>

13:37.870 --> 13:39.510
<b>A single strike from behind.</b>

13:39.510 --> 13:40.490
<b>Beautiful.</b>

13:41.470 --> 13:43.820
<b>His presence was only exposed 
for a brief instant,</b>

13:43.820 --> 13:46.070
<b>and barely any trace remains.</b>

13:49.360 --> 13:51.590
<b>I suppose I'll have to use <i>En</i>.</b>

13:52.150 --> 13:55.310
<b>It's an exhausting technique.</b>

13:56.680 --> 14:00.670
<b>Let's start from the roof and head down...</b>

14:00.670 --> 14:03.410
<b>This building's radius is one hundred meters.</b>

14:03.790 --> 14:05.320
<b>Will you be okay, old man?</b>

14:05.320 --> 14:09.190
<b>Fool, if I wanted, I could 
handle three times that.</b>

14:10.730 --> 14:14.200
<b>This job is hardly worth the pay...</b>

14:43.480 --> 14:44.980
<b>You're late, Kurapika!</b>

14:45.380 --> 14:46.740
<b>Hurry back right now.</b>

14:46.740 --> 14:48.370
<b>Stay at Neon's side!</b>

14:49.940 --> 14:51.910
<b>Right, I'm on my way.</b>

14:53.740 --> 14:54.610
<b>Damn!</b>

15:24.630 --> 15:26.170
<b>We meet again.</b>

15:26.170 --> 15:27.760
<b>You remember me?</b>

15:28.330 --> 15:29.800
<b>How could I forget?</b>

15:29.800 --> 15:32.340
<b>You killed one of my people.</b>

15:32.340 --> 15:33.730
<b>It was difficult.</b>

15:36.900 --> 15:38.580
<b>Careful, old man.</b>

15:39.120 --> 15:41.600
<b>He can steal your techniques.</b>

16:28.990 --> 16:31.170
<b><i>This could be hard, fighting one on two.</i></b>

16:31.600 --> 16:35.080
<b><i>It takes a quality knife to scratch me.</i></b>

16:35.610 --> 16:38.930
<b><i>Looks to be a mid-era Ben's knife.</i></b>

16:39.990 --> 16:41.040
<b><i>That shape...</i></b>

16:41.040 --> 16:41.930
<b><i>It's poisoned?</i></b>

16:44.670 --> 16:45.810
<b>You okay?</b>

16:46.550 --> 16:47.730
<b>I'm just fine.</b>

<b><i>Just fine?</i></b>

16:49.390 --> 16:53.740
<b><i>A tenth of a milligram will 
completely paralyze a whale.</i></b>

16:55.220 --> 16:57.600
<b>So you can steal other people's <i>Nen</i>?</b>

16:57.600 --> 16:59.140
<b>You must be a Specialist.</b>

16:59.140 --> 17:03.440
<b>I would consider you a threat if you 
could freely use the powers you steal.</b>

17:04.050 --> 17:08.280
<b>However, you must take risks 
to take those abilities.</b>

17:08.280 --> 17:11.510
<b>A technique that strong must 
have its drawbacks...</b>

17:12.260 --> 17:14.200
<b>I would guess</b>

17:14.200 --> 17:18.640
<b>you must clear four or five conditions 
before you can steal an ability.</b>

17:18.640 --> 17:20.390
<b><i>Correct.</i></b>

17:20.390 --> 17:22.020
<b><i>The old man's a difficult opponent.</i></b>

17:22.020 --> 17:27.640
<b>It will be difficult to clear those 
conditions while you fight us.</b>

17:27.640 --> 17:30.500
<b>Meaning that you won't be able</b>

17:30.500 --> 17:33.400
<b>to steal our abilities while we fight.</b>

17:33.740 --> 17:36.910
<b>Proven by your need to use a 
poisoned knife as a deterrent.</b>

17:37.220 --> 17:38.750
<b><i>Correct again.</i></b>

17:39.380 --> 17:40.160
<b><i>I have no choice.</i></b>

17:45.390 --> 17:47.300
<b>Silva, I'll need your support.</b>

17:47.300 --> 17:49.750
<b>Once I lock him in place,</b>

17:49.750 --> 17:52.550
<b>kill him, even if you have 
to kill me with him.</b>

17:53.410 --> 17:54.300
<b>Understood.</b>

18:10.810 --> 18:13.280
<b><i>He focused his aura into his hand.</i></b>

18:13.280 --> 18:14.990
<b><i>He has incredible potential.</i></b>

18:14.990 --> 18:18.520
<b><i>I won't be able to block that attack.</i></b>

<b><i>Even if it's a stolen ability, 
I can't attack recklessly</i></b>

18:52.490 --> 18:54.860
<b><i>without knowing what it's capable of.</i></b>

18:57.200 --> 19:00.860
<b><i>That would be an ordinary fighter's reaction...</i></b>

19:35.370 --> 19:37.310
<b><i>in that Conjured book</i></b>

19:37.310 --> 19:40.980
<b><i>letting him use them freely.</i></b>

19:42.830 --> 19:46.910
<b><i>In return, when he uses another ability,</i></b>

19:46.910 --> 19:50.540
<b><i>he must hold that book 
in his hands at all times.</i></b>

19:52.190 --> 19:54.670
<b><i>The mantle is also a Conjured item.</i></b>

19:54.670 --> 19:57.860
<b><i>He has shown no signs of taking the offensive,</i></b>

19:57.860 --> 20:01.380
<b><i>but he's trying to close the gap between us.</i></b>

20:01.380 --> 20:05.570
<b><i>So it's a defensive tool that can be used</i></b>

20:05.570 --> 20:08.230
<b><i>to close the distance and counterattack.</i></b>

20:09.550 --> 20:13.060
<b><i>Which means I have no reason 
not to fight from a distance.</i></b>

20:13.060 --> 20:15.110
<b><i>Then I wait for my chance, and grab it.</i></b>

20:16.870 --> 20:18.530
<b><i>This old man is incredible.</i></b>

20:19.170 --> 20:22.320
<b><i>He managed to read my mind in a flash.</i></b>

20:23.780 --> 20:25.280

<b><i>the ability he withdrew also vanishes?</i></b>

20:34.450 --> 20:36.750
<b><i>In any case, he's quite talented.</i></b>

20:37.380 --> 20:40.010
<b><i>He dodges each of my old man's

20:40.010 --> 20:42.760
<b><i>leaving me no opening to attack.</i></b>

20:44.880 --> 20:47.710
<b><i>He's physically stronger than before.</i></b>

20:48.400 --> 20:51.900
<b><i>Since we don't know what abilities he has,</i></b>
