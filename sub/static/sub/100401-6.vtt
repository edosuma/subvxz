17:59.533 --> 18:00.827
‐ He is!

18:00.827 --> 18:02.038
‐ Yeah, y‐you think I don't
agree with you?

18:02.038 --> 18:03.332
You think I like Andy?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.461
‐ Come on, man.
I've got kids.

18:05.461 --> 18:08.008
If you fire me, I'll have
to be with 'em all day.

18:08.008 --> 18:10.388
‐ That sucks, man, but look,
he went to HR.

18:10.388 --> 18:11.641
Okay?
My hands are tied.

18:11.641 --> 18:13.895
T‐there's nothing I can do.

18:13.895 --> 18:16.024
‐ [cries]

18:16.024 --> 18:18.530
‐ Hey, come on, man.
Are you all right?

18:18.530 --> 18:21.703
‐ We were friends.
Does that not matter to you?

18:21.703 --> 18:24.792
‐ It matters to me.
I'm so‐‐

18:24.792 --> 18:26.754
Keep your head up, dude.
You don't have to do that.

18:26.754 --> 18:29.927
‐ [crying]

18:32.348 --> 18:34.394
‐ Um, hey everyone.

18:34.394 --> 18:35.939
Uh, I just wanted
to take a moment

18:35.939 --> 18:38.193
to say that today
is a very special day.

18:38.193 --> 18:41.659
It is officially,
Amadi's first firing, so‐‐

18:41.659 --> 18:42.870
AMADI: Ruthie.

18:42.870 --> 18:44.540
‐ Let's‐‐let's‐‐
let's give it up.

18:44.540 --> 18:49.508
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
AMADI: Ruthie.

18:49.508 --> 18:50.719

18:50.719 --> 18:51.971
AMADI: Hey.

18:51.971 --> 18:53.641
You got any advice
on how to fire somebody

18:53.641 --> 18:54.977
without feeling like shit?

18:54.977 --> 18:56.898
‐ Oh, that's tough,
'cause I really enjoy that.

18:56.898 --> 18:58.693
Could you do me a favor?

18:58.693 --> 19:02.033
Could you tell Annie that her
article is boring and soulless?

19:02.033 --> 19:04.538
‐ No, that's creative.
That's your department.

19:04.538 --> 19:06.918
‐ What? Fuck you.
I said it was a favor.

19:06.918 --> 19:08.630
‐ All right, easy.
GABE: God.

19:08.630 --> 19:10.634
All right, send her in
when she gets here.

19:22.365 --> 19:23.450
‐ I mean, Annie,

19:23.450 --> 19:26.749
clearly, what you wrote sucks.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.628
It's terrible. It's boring.

19:28.628 --> 19:31.551
‐ Well, you're the one who
told me not to editorialize.

19:31.551 --> 19:34.515
‐ You wrote the word "She‐E‐O"
without irony or commentary.

19:34.515 --> 19:35.976
Are you dead?

19:35.976 --> 19:39.900
What do you really feel about
this Woman Moment thing?

19:39.900 --> 19:42.446
You, Annie.
ANNIE: I don't know.

19:42.446 --> 19:44.033
It was, um...

19:45.244 --> 19:47.373
Inspiring, I guess?

19:47.373 --> 19:49.587
And demented.
‐ "Demented, I guess?"

19:49.587 --> 19:52.258
What've you been hanging out
in the Clackamas Town Center?

19:52.258 --> 19:54.137
What's with this jargon?

19:54.137 --> 19:57.310
‐ I‐‐it just‐‐it made me think
that there's a reason

19:57.310 --> 19:59.480
that men don't need to be,
like,

19:59.480 --> 20:01.569
constantly told
that they're powerful.

20:01.569 --> 20:05.492
It's because they're in power.
‐ Okay, and with women?

20:05.492 --> 20:08.123
‐ And women, I mean,
we're, like,

20:08.123 --> 20:11.379
screaming in huge pink letters
that we're powerful

20:11.379 --> 20:13.760
just to try and convince
ourselves, you know?

20:13.760 --> 20:16.097
And‐‐and all the statistics
that they gave

20:16.097 --> 20:19.312
about how bad
things are for women,

20:19.312 --> 20:21.316
it's, like,
it's a thousand times worse

20:21.316 --> 20:22.945
if you're a woman
who can't afford

20:22.945 --> 20:25.282
to be slathered in $100 oils.

20:25.282 --> 20:27.328
‐ Okay. So it's a con.

20:28.413 --> 20:31.461
‐ Yes, but there were also
all these women there

20:31.461 --> 20:34.300
who were genuinely really
getting something out of it.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.388
But to me, it just felt like
it was about money.

20:36.388 --> 20:38.601
‐ Okay. We're getting somewhere.

20:38.601 --> 20:40.312
Monetizing feminism.
Right?

20:40.312 --> 20:43.443
‐ Yes, exactly, and women
are made to feel so insecure

20:43.443 --> 20:44.655
and then each insecurity

20:44.655 --> 20:47.368
is like a new opportunity
to make more money.

20:47.368 --> 20:49.205
‐ It's sad.
‐ Yes.

20:49.205 --> 20:52.461
And all day, all they talked
about was self‐care,

20:52.461 --> 20:54.550
but it's not taking care
of yourself

20:54.550 --> 20:58.181
to agree that you're ugly
and you need to be fixed.

20:58.181 --> 20:59.308
‐ Okay.

20:59.308 --> 21:02.774
Okay, so what is a moment
of true self‐care

21:02.774 --> 21:05.154
if you strip everything away
here?

21:05.154 --> 21:07.408
What's an example?

21:07.408 --> 21:11.082
‐ Well, I mean,
if I'm being honest, like,

21:11.082 --> 21:13.880
the first thing that I think of

21:13.880 --> 21:15.925
is my abortion, you know?

21:15.925 --> 21:19.015
I mean, that was care.

21:19.015 --> 21:21.896
I had to in the moment
evaluate what I wanted,

21:21.896 --> 21:23.398
and take care of myself,

21:23.398 --> 21:26.739
and then all the women that were
there that took care of me.

21:26.739 --> 21:28.618
‐ Well, thanks for telling me.

21:28.618 --> 21:31.122
I mean,
this is totally your call,

21:31.122 --> 21:35.214
but you could, you know,
put that in the article.

21:35.214 --> 21:39.430
‐ Yeah, I mean I'm‐‐I'm not
afraid to, it's just the truth.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.560
‐ Well, then go do it.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.480
‐ Okay. Great.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.900
Yeah.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.031
Thanks, Gabe, I actually feel
like we really, like,

21:48.031 --> 21:49.660
worked it out together
in a nice way‐‐

21:49.660 --> 21:51.539
‐ Yeah,
let's not stretch this out.

21:51.539 --> 21:53.543
‐ Yeah, totally.
GABE: Really ruin it.

21:53.543 --> 21:56.089
‐ Okay, well, um,
thank you so much.

21:56.089 --> 21:59.680
And um, this‐‐really awesome.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.224
Really, really, really great.

22:03.688 --> 22:06.025
‐ Wow, sounds like it went
really great in there.

22:06.025 --> 22:09.198
‐ Yeah, it actually really did.
It was great.

22:09.198 --> 22:12.664
‐ Well, just know that
if you try and replace me

22:12.664 --> 22:14.668
as Gabe's best girl,

22:14.668 --> 22:16.462
I'm gonna go to your desk
and find something

22:16.462 --> 22:18.133
that means a lot to you,

22:18.133 --> 22:20.304
and I'm gonna bludgeon you
to death with it.

22:20.304 --> 22:22.433
‐ Very cool.
RYAN: Holy shit!

22:22.433 --> 22:24.020
‐ Yeah.
[laughs]

22:24.020 --> 22:25.773
‐ Ryan?
‐ Annie!

22:25.773 --> 22:28.195
I got a job!
‐ What?

22:28.195 --> 22:29.907
‐ I got a job here too.

22:29.907 --> 22:31.785
‐ Yeah, he said that you were
askin' him to get a job,

22:31.785 --> 22:33.330
and we had an opening, so.

22:34.666 --> 22:37.046
‐ I'm officially
a distro guy now.

22:37.046 --> 22:39.133
‐ Um, that's...

22:40.720 --> 22:43.016
That's great.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.268
‐ Come here. Come on.

22:44.268 --> 22:46.774
‐ Oh, yes.
‐ Ho‐ho‐hey‐hey!

22:46.774 --> 22:48.443
RYAN: Oh, fuck.
ANNIE: I don't think‐‐

22:48.443 --> 22:51.074
‐ Not in the office!
RYAN: [sighs] Sorry.

22:51.074 --> 22:52.409
‐ Privacy of your own home,
go nuts.

22:52.409 --> 22:53.579
‐ Of course.

22:53.579 --> 22:54.915
‐ Do whatever the fuck
you guys want.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.627
RYAN: Oh.
ANNIE: Mmm.

22:56.627 --> 22:58.338
‐ All right, guys, let's fill
this paperwork out.

22:58.338 --> 22:59.633
RYAN: See you soon.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

22:59.633 --> 23:02.137
‐ Nosies.
This is so fun.

23:02.137 --> 23:05.687
AMADI: Let's go!
[laughter]

23:05.687 --> 23:07.565
