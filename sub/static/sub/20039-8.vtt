00:06.867 --> 00:09.567
One controversy
can kill a product.

00:11.467 --> 00:14.400
Fix this.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.067
Hey, Lori, you know,

00:18.133 --> 00:19.467
this is all
a misunderstanding, okay?

00:19.533 --> 00:22.067
George, look, I can
fix a lot of things.

00:22.133 --> 00:23.733
Product delays,
distribution jam-ups.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.067
FTC regulations.

00:26.133 --> 00:28.700
But I can't fix your
problem with Latinos.

00:28.767 --> 00:29.933
You have to.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.067
Yes, I know, Lori, all right?
And I will.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.600
Just as soon as we go
out and have a nice--

00:34.967 --> 00:38.067
I'm on it.
I'll do it right now.

00:38.133 --> 00:42.067
**

00:45.667 --> 00:47.400
Thank you.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.533
I mean, muchisima gracias.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.533
You know, Manolo,

00:51.600 --> 00:53.600
this place has
some of the best beef tamales

00:53.667 --> 00:55.067
in all of Los Angeles.

00:55.133 --> 00:57.067
They're so authentically
Mexican,

00:57.133 --> 01:00.133
like me, George Lopez,
authentically Mexican.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.467
Yeah, they're really good.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.633
Yeah, los gringos, they don't
know what they're missing.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.767
Especially that pendejo
Donald Trump.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.167
People think you love him.

01:08.233 --> 01:09.967
Man, I still can't believe
you played golf with him.

01:10.067 --> 01:11.200
By the way, who won?

01:11.267 --> 01:12.267
(chuckling)
That's right, Manolo.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.467
Thank you for bringing that up

01:13.533 --> 01:15.133
and reminding me
of who I play golf with.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.700
I play golf with
Salma Hayek.

01:16.767 --> 01:19.833
I play golf with Lee Trevino,
Chi-Chi Rodriguez, Cesar Chávez.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.133
Me and Cesar Chávez played
when I was little.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.133
We'd work in the fields
half-day.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.800
And then play nine holes
the rest of the day.

01:25.867 --> 01:27.867
Isn't that right, Manolo?

01:27.933 --> 01:30.133
Yes.
Where's El Hector?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.533
I thought he was
gonna meet us here.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.233
Oh, he's getting
together with Lori.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.933
Oh, yeah, that's right.
(nervous chuckle)

01:35.067 --> 01:37.133
Do you remember exactly what
they were gonna meet about

01:37.200 --> 01:39.600
or you can recall
his exact works?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.133
Exact words:

01:41.200 --> 01:43.667
"Man, Lori is woke.

01:43.733 --> 01:46.333
I mean, she's lit, tight."

01:46.400 --> 01:47.500
Uh...

01:47.567 --> 01:49.833
(laughter)

01:49.900 --> 01:52.867
What's everybody laughing at?

01:52.933 --> 01:55.067
(speaking Spanish)

01:57.800 --> 01:59.133
Hey, look,
it's Platanito.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.667
I love that show.
Mommy does, too.

02:01.733 --> 02:03.767
She love Platanito
as much as she hates you.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.833
That's how everyone
around here feels now.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.533
Yeah, well, excuse me for
wearing suits when I work

02:08.600 --> 02:11.100
and not a fright wig
with long, red shoes.

02:11.167 --> 02:13.067
Hey, jefe, maybe you
should go on Platanito.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.667
You can explain what happened
with the white supremacists.

02:15.733 --> 02:18.133
Might get your Mexican
fans to like you again.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.833
(clears throat)
You know, that sounds like
a good idea, Manolo,

02:19.900 --> 02:21.667
but, you know,
you don't know that Platanito

02:21.733 --> 02:24.233
and I, we have a little, you
know, we got a little history.

02:24.300 --> 02:26.333
Right, I forgot.
He thinks you're a sell-out.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.867
Yeah, I'm a sell-out,
all right.

02:27.933 --> 02:29.867
I sell-out stadiums, huh?

02:29.933 --> 02:31.867
Smaller arenas.

02:31.933 --> 02:34.067
Right there in Hemet.

02:34.133 --> 02:36.300
I'll tell you
something about Platanito:
You're his biggest fan.

02:36.367 --> 02:37.667
First time he saw me,
comes up, he's, like,

02:37.733 --> 02:40.067
"Hey, George Lopez."
Got a big smile on his face.

02:40.067 --> 02:42.200
"I'm so happy for you
and all of your success."

02:42.267 --> 02:43.933
Then he stops.
Smile disappears.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.533
He goes, "No, I'm not.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.200
Every time I see you on TV,
I think that should be me."

02:48.267 --> 02:50.867
Huh? And even though
he's a big success,

02:50.933 --> 02:52.200
he still has a problem with me.

02:52.267 --> 02:53.633
He thinks I don't respect
his comedy.

02:53.700 --> 02:57.667
Wow, Platanito's a legend
and he hates your guts.

02:57.733 --> 03:00.267
Seriously? That's what you're
getting from this story?

03:00.333 --> 03:03.267
(speaking Spanish)

03:03.333 --> 03:04.933
Eat your beef tamales.

03:05.067 --> 03:07.900
They're delicious.

03:07.967 --> 03:11.267
**

03:11.333 --> 03:13.267
When I do my report
on "Huckleberry Finn"

03:13.333 --> 03:15.400
I wonder if it's okay
if I just call him Jim.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.733
(whistle alert)

03:20.833 --> 03:22.533
Oh, my God, I get
a hold of Olly, man.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.067
If this controversy
keeps growing,

03:24.133 --> 03:26.300
it's gonna derail "Valleys,"
I'll never get it back on track.

03:26.367 --> 03:29.467
I donated to just about every
Latino charity in L.A., right?

03:29.533 --> 03:32.267
I've built half of the sports
fields in San Fernando.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.067
And the only thing
getting traction

03:34.133 --> 03:36.633
are these fake news stories
about me-- Look at this one:

03:36.700 --> 03:40.600
"Donald Trump is considering his
good friend and trusted adviser,

03:40.667 --> 03:44.067
George Lopez for the post of
Minister of Mexican Affairs."

03:44.133 --> 03:46.500
There is no Minister
of Mexican Affairs.

03:46.567 --> 03:49.900
"Replacing Scott Baio who is
rumored to be moving to the UN."

03:49.967 --> 03:51.733
Yo, G, you got a crush?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.267
These flowers just
came in for you.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.267
From who?
From, like,
some fraternity?

03:55.333 --> 03:58.600
Fraternity?

03:58.667 --> 04:01.133
From the Brotherhood
of White Supremacists.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.300
I saw those dudes.
I thought they were cholos.

04:03.367 --> 04:05.800
They were skinheads.

04:05.867 --> 04:08.833
Pale cholos,
they ain't no pale cholos.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.200
(George)
Oh, my God,
how do we make this go away?

04:11.267 --> 04:12.567
George, I've been
looking into it.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.567
The thing we need to do
is hire a crisis manager.

04:14.633 --> 04:15.833
No, I got a good PR person.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.333
Yeah, but this is like
a PR guy on steroids.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.333
Oh, he specializes in problems
like this.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.333
The guy I'm talking
to handled Paula Deen...

04:22.400 --> 04:24.567
Michael Richards, remember?

04:24.633 --> 04:26.667
Basically celebrities who
bad-mouth Black people.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.233
But he's looking to branch out.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.633
That's horrible,
and it sounds expensive.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.133
It's gonna cost less
than your career.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.533
The network is not happy.
Really? What did you hear?

04:34.600 --> 04:37.333
Not what she heard,
it's what I heard.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.700
Yeah, Pfeiffer,
what did you hear?

04:38.767 --> 04:40.667
Well, you're not
gonna believe this.

04:40.733 --> 04:43.067
But, hold on, what happened
to my leftover Chinese food?

04:43.067 --> 04:44.600
Did you eat it?
No.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.067
Well, it didn't just sprout legs
and walk away.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.833
Well, I'm not lying.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.400
Wait, what, did you hear from
the network or from Rachel...

04:50.467 --> 04:53.067
Mom, what happened
to the Chinese food?

04:53.100 --> 04:55.067
I threw it out, sweetie, sorry.

04:55.067 --> 04:56.633
Oh, hi, George.
Hi.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.333
Can I make you a sandwich?
Oh, no, no,

04:58.400 --> 04:59.900
I'm fine, thanks.
Why would you throw it out?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.800
It was three days
old and half empty.

05:01.867 --> 05:04.100
Half empty?
I barely touched it.

05:04.167 --> 05:05.467
Okay, I had a little.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.167
Jesus, do I have to write
my name on everything?

05:07.233 --> 05:08.633
I bought that with my own money.

05:08.700 --> 05:09.867
There's no way in hell
you paid for that.

05:09.933 --> 05:11.533
Mom paid for that.
She earned it.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.367
She brought in the garbage cans.
Big deal.

05:13.433 --> 05:15.433
God dammit! What did the network
say, Pfeiffer?

05:15.500 --> 05:18.533
I'm sorry, Pf--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.067
They said they're not happy
about it.

05:22.133 --> 05:24.867
I'm sorry.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.433
Will you tell your mom...
that I'm sorry.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.733
You need to get an office.
Yeah.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.433
I'll set something up
with the crisis guy.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.133
Yeah? Where does
he work out of, a camper?

05:33.200 --> 05:34.900
Not a bad idea.

05:34.967 --> 05:39.367
Okay, see, then you have to take
this part and divide it.

05:39.433 --> 05:40.733
And then into that part--

05:40.800 --> 05:42.400
Hey!
What's happening?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.200
We were studying.
Okay.

05:44.267 --> 05:46.700
George, this is my teacher,
Wendy.
Hey, Wendy.

05:46.767 --> 05:48.200
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

05:48.267 --> 05:50.067
Wow, a teacher that comes
to the house; that's dedication.

05:50.133 --> 05:53.200
Yes, that's exactly what it is,
and, uh, he's an adult

05:53.267 --> 05:55.533
and there's nothing
to report to anybody, you know?

05:55.600 --> 05:57.867
Oh, jefe, there's something
I need to tell you.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.933
My mommy is planning on suing
you for stealing her grill idea.

06:01.067 --> 06:03.933
What?
(alerts play, vibrates)

06:04.067 --> 06:06.067
Hey, Hector says we gotta
turn on GVN.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.900
What do you mean
your mom is suing me?

06:07.967 --> 06:09.800
(Hector)
You all have to listen up.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.400
Grab your phone
and call right now.

06:12.467 --> 06:13.800
This grill is amazing.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.367
You gotta get it,
you gotta buy it.

06:15.433 --> 06:16.933
Oh, my God,
he's selling the grill.

06:17.067 --> 06:19.367
Lori's got him selling
the grill without me.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.067
And all for 29.95.

06:21.133 --> 06:23.467
And he's humping the product
and the price.

06:23.533 --> 06:25.067
I guess he can
just do it all, huh?

06:25.133 --> 06:27.367
Just grillin' and chillin'.
First you grill.

06:27.433 --> 06:28.867
Then you chill.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.467
That's probably what
the little meeting was about.

06:30.533 --> 06:31.900
Son of a bitch!

06:31.967 --> 06:34.133
Hector's moving up in the world.
He's on the rise.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.267
Isn't that what you wanted?

06:35.333 --> 06:36.767
Yeah, but not with me slipping.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.867
She's giving up on me, man,
she's moving on.

06:38.933 --> 06:42.800
You know, 29.95 is a little
steep for a teacher's pay.

06:42.867 --> 06:46.633
How many payments you think
we could break that up into?

06:46.700 --> 06:49.100
That's a good problem for you.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.567
No, we're not that far yet.

06:53.567 --> 06:55.833
We got pollo, carnita,
machaca...

06:55.900 --> 06:57.367
She's betting on Hector,
not me.

06:57.433 --> 06:58.767
You don't know that.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.500
Well, I don't come up
looking like a winner.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.300
I come up looking like a loser.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.200
And she don't look like the type
of woman that's into losers.

07:04.267 --> 07:05.833
She's probably, like,
one of those directors

07:05.900 --> 07:07.667
that always
has sex with the stars.

07:07.733 --> 07:09.833
Relax, jefe.
How can I relax?

07:09.900 --> 07:11.633
Probably can't keep
her hands off him.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.167
Mm, I know I couldn't.
(chuckling)

07:14.233 --> 07:16.500
Because that boy is fine!

07:16.567 --> 07:18.500
Listen, be honest with me.
Give it to me straight.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.100
Is he your jail wife?

07:20.167 --> 07:21.700
Traitor.
Jefe...

07:21.767 --> 07:23.833
you're doing that thing that I'm
supposed to stop you from doing.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.500
Catasrophe...
Catastrophizing?

07:25.567 --> 07:27.300
Yeah.
That's because it's true.

07:27.367 --> 07:30.167
Every problem I got
comes from the same thing.

07:30.233 --> 07:31.433
That controversy.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.833
Screw it, man,
you know what?

07:34.900 --> 07:37.167
I'ma do it.
What are you gonna do?

07:37.233 --> 07:38.400
I'm gonna go on Platanito.

07:38.467 --> 07:39.967
What's Platanito?

07:40.067 --> 07:42.167
Hey, whatever it is,
put some cheese on mine.

07:42.233 --> 07:43.967
(laughing)

07:44.067 --> 07:45.600
He's like the
Mexican Johnny Carson.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.500
Oh.
Yeah, I gotta get hold of Lori.

07:47.567 --> 07:48.833
I think I can get this
under control.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.500
Man, I feel bad for my jefe.

07:51.567 --> 07:52.933
Yeah, me too.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.500
What type of bathtub
you think he's got upstairs?

07:55.567 --> 07:57.333
Let's go check it out.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.067
(laughing)

08:00.100 --> 08:02.233
The show that you wanna
be on is Platanito.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.567
But that's not his real name.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.100
No, no, but, it, it--
That's brilliant.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.567
He's a combination of Carson,
Kimmel and Fallon

08:07.633 --> 08:09.567
all rolled into one,
and he's very authentic,

08:09.633 --> 08:11.467
and he's very trusted
by his audience.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.567
Wow, you really
do know who he is.

08:13.633 --> 08:14.900
He has a makeup line.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.233
We were gonna make
a deal with him,

08:16.300 --> 08:17.367
but we went with you instead.

08:17.433 --> 08:18.567
In retrospect, I just--

08:18.633 --> 08:19.867
What do you mean,
in retrospect?

08:19.933 --> 08:22.867
In retrospect,
I couldn't be happier.

08:22.933 --> 08:24.300
Thank you.
Now, come on.

08:24.367 --> 08:26.067
I mean, can we go back
to the way things were?

08:26.100 --> 08:29.100
With me selling grills and
Hector as my sidekick behind me,

08:29.167 --> 08:30.467
not doing my job?

08:30.533 --> 08:33.200
Wait...
Are you jealous of Hector?

08:33.267 --> 08:34.567
Of course not.

08:34.633 --> 08:35.900
Why would I be jealous
of Hector?

08:35.967 --> 08:38.567
Do I have a reason...
to be jealous of hector?

08:38.633 --> 08:40.700
(alert buzzing)
George, please...

08:40.767 --> 08:43.967
Do I have a reason
to be jealous of hector?

08:44.067 --> 08:46.100
(Lori)
I expressly told you...
Lori?

08:46.167 --> 08:48.900
(door opens, closes)

08:48.967 --> 08:51.800
I do apologize, I...
I don't know where George is.

08:51.867 --> 08:53.167
He said he was gonna
be here a half-hour ago.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.567
Uh, never say you don't
know where you client is.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.233
Of course you know
where he is.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.267
He's taking personal time.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.633
Oh, I like that,
very helpful.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.167
Now, when we get him
into treatment,

09:02.233 --> 09:03.633
we're calling it exhaustion.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.100
He only tells the truth
to Diane Sawyer

09:05.167 --> 09:07.067
once the memoir
deal is in place.

09:07.133 --> 09:08.633
Oh, okay.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.533
Maybe your assistant didn't
explain to you our situation.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.100
So, George made some comments
that were interpreted

09:13.167 --> 09:14.967
negatively by
the Latino community

09:15.067 --> 09:18.233
and positively by some
white supremacist groups.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.467
You know what we do?

09:19.533 --> 09:21.167
We do a public sit-down
with Al Sharpton.

09:21.233 --> 09:22.833
You know, cry, pray, laugh.

09:22.900 --> 09:26.700
Yeah, but why would George
apologize to a Black minister?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.967
There's a lot of overlap,
but, uh, point well taken.

09:29.067 --> 09:32.167
Now, who's the
Latino Al Sharpton?

09:32.233 --> 09:35.300
Pitbull, Eva Longoria?

09:35.367 --> 09:36.700
Geraldo.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.633
Hmm... maybe.
(alert vibrates)

09:38.700 --> 09:40.633
Oh! Ohh...

09:40.700 --> 09:42.633
George booked himself
on a Mexican talk show

09:42.700 --> 09:45.300
with somebody called Platanito.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.567
Well, that could
fix everything.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.800
I think we're done here.

09:49.867 --> 09:51.733
Okay, everybody, listen up

09:51.800 --> 09:54.433
'cause this will
totally be on the test.

09:54.500 --> 09:58.867
Huck Finn and Jim travelled
the mighty Mississippi.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.767
Sort of like the first
black/white buddy movie,

10:00.833 --> 10:02.100
like, um, "Stir Crazy"

10:02.167 --> 10:03.967
or "Trading Places",
something like that.

10:04.033 --> 10:04.767
Uh-oh.

10:04.833 --> 10:07.100
Uh, excuse me.

10:07.167 --> 10:09.433
There will be no note passing
in Miss Wendy's classroom.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.033
I was just--

10:11.100 --> 10:12.633
Uh, you were just about to
read it to the entire class.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.300
No, Miss Wendy, no need
to embarrass anyone.

10:14.367 --> 10:15.633
Oh, I get to embarrass somebody.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.600
It's one of the perks
of the job, read!

10:17.667 --> 10:19.967
"To my beautiful plump papaya.

10:20.033 --> 10:21.933
"I spend all class
staring at you.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.200
"I just wanna kiss your
juicy lips and rub your feet.

10:25.267 --> 10:26.233
Love, Manolo."

10:26.300 --> 10:28.867
Oh, ew, do you
have a crush on me?

10:28.933 --> 10:30.833
Uh...

10:30.900 --> 10:33.767
Yes, un, yes, yes, he does.
He's got a crush on you.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.800
Look, everybody,
Manolo wrote a love letter

10:35.867 --> 10:37.033
to the pregnant lady.

10:37.100 --> 10:37.867
(laughing)

10:37.933 --> 10:39.100
What is wrong with you?

10:39.167 --> 10:40.967
Can't you see
she's with child?

10:41.033 --> 10:44.167
Gross, the baby is throwing up
inside me.

10:44.233 --> 10:46.300
(school bell rings)
Uh, dismissed.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.833
Especially the bald, perv guy.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.633
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.300
But after that, I'm totally up
for making out.

11:04.500 --> 11:07.167
(knocking on door)

11:07.233 --> 11:10.700
Ay, wey! Look who it is,
Platanito.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.500
Hola, George, todo tiempo.

11:12.567 --> 11:14.933
Platanito says, "Hello, George,
it's been a while."

11:15.067 --> 11:16.900
Yeah, too long.
(chuckling)

11:16.967 --> 11:19.100
(speaking Spanish)

11:20.600 --> 11:23.167
Platanito says, "Suddenly you
wanna be on my show?

11:23.233 --> 11:24.900
I've been trying
to get you on forever."

11:24.967 --> 11:27.600
Yes, I know Spanish.
I don't need a translator.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.800
(speaking Spanish)

11:34.333 --> 11:37.367
He says, "You don't remember
how to speak Spanish anymore.

11:37.433 --> 11:38.900
You sold out to the Anglos."

11:38.967 --> 11:41.733
Wow, you really gonna make
me beg, huh, Platanito?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.167
Absolutely.

11:43.233 --> 11:44.833
Shit.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.900
Jorge say "caca."

11:46.967 --> 11:47.967
Eww.

11:49.967 --> 11:51.167
Okay.
You wanna do it?

11:51.233 --> 11:52.900
Let's do it.
But we don't need him.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.267
Okay, look, I'm here--

11:59.333 --> 12:01.467
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
In Spanish, por favor.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.367
I mean, this is the problem
with Latinos, okay?

12:03.433 --> 12:05.600
You think because I don't speak
Spanish as well as you do,

12:05.667 --> 12:07.233
that we're less Latino, okay?

12:07.300 --> 12:09.767
I come in peace, Platanito.
I come to bury the hatchet.

12:16.833 --> 12:19.100
That's Photoshopped.
I'm wearing a bathing suit.

12:19.167 --> 12:21.333
And he's got a jacket
with fur on the collar.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.100
If you didn't
want white success,

12:33.167 --> 12:34.700
you wouldn't have asked
to be on my show.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.067
And you say no!

12:36.067 --> 12:37.767
Because you didn't wanna
take your makeup off.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.767
You were playing a lawyer.
That would look strange!

12:39.833 --> 12:41.533
To your audience!

12:41.600 --> 12:43.767
Okay, Platanito, listen.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.433
We both did what we had to do
to make it to the top.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.867
We're professionals.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.900
(giggling)

12:58.500 --> 12:59.467
I never said that.

12:59.533 --> 13:01.700
I never said that, okay?

13:01.767 --> 13:04.167
If you respect my comedy,
tell me.

13:04.233 --> 13:05.533
I do, I do.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.500
Say it.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.833
I respect your comedy.
Yes!

13:10.900 --> 13:12.767
(giggling)

13:12.833 --> 13:15.133
All right, now,
can I do your show?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.833
(laughing)

13:16.900 --> 13:18.867
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.833
Man, that was a close call.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.767
Manolo, we can't be seen
together.

13:23.833 --> 13:25.133
Okay, got it.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.300
You wanna come over
to George's house

13:26.367 --> 13:27.833
and watch the shopping channel
with me?

13:27.900 --> 13:29.867
No, I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

13:29.933 --> 13:31.167
Why, you have papers to grade?

13:31.233 --> 13:32.833
Listen, we almost
got exposed.

13:32.900 --> 13:36.867
If it wasn't for my acting
skills, I'd be toast right now.

13:36.933 --> 13:39.267
So, we can't be together?
You'll be fired?

13:39.333 --> 13:41.167
Well, I work for the
Unified School District.

13:41.233 --> 13:44.167
I can't be fired.
I mean, seriously.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.633
Teachers have dealt drugs,
sold stolen goods,

13:46.700 --> 13:50.200
exposed themselves to students
and they never got fired.

13:50.267 --> 13:52.400
So, our love is
worse than all that?

13:52.467 --> 13:53.833
No.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.833
I can't be fired,
but I could be reassigned.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.833
And I can't go back
to teaching sixth grade.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.567
I just can't do it.
Those students are monsters.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.367
And those girls are evil.

14:03.433 --> 14:05.933
They'll come up and make fun
of you right in your face.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.333
And they'll just
haul off and hit you.

14:10.967 --> 14:13.433
I'm sorry, baby.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.967
It's over.

14:16.967 --> 14:18.967
(car starts)

14:28.167 --> 14:29.567
Wow.

14:29.633 --> 14:32.567
Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino...

14:32.633 --> 14:34.567
That guy
from that band.

14:34.633 --> 14:36.367
Sofia Vergara.

14:36.433 --> 14:38.233
Other lady,
beautiful ladies.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.900
Who's that guy with the big hat
and the moustache?

14:39.967 --> 14:41.233
Oh, yeah.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.833
That was the president
of Mexico.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.233
Wow, dang.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.367
So, this Platanito guy
really has juice, huh?

14:46.433 --> 14:48.900
Yeah, that's why we're here,
Olly.
Huh.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.733
I feel like
I should've known.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.233
One of the most popular
talk shows

14:52.300 --> 14:55.567
in the most important
emerging markets is a clown.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.267
Right.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.433
A clown.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.167
Yeah.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.300
Ah, it's crazy.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.967
They always put out food
but I can never eat.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.633
Free food is wasted
on famous people.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.967
Ahh... I'm nervous.

15:11.067 --> 15:12.533
Don't be nervous.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.967
Ay, wey.

15:15.067 --> 15:16.967
The beast brought a beauty.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.433
Oh, me? No, no, no,
I'm just his...

15:19.500 --> 15:21.933
I don't...
I'm not a beauty.

15:22.067 --> 15:24.967
Do not apologize.
I have that effect on women.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.200
(laughing)

15:26.267 --> 15:27.300
(giggling and farting)

15:27.367 --> 15:28.767
Oh, okay.
(beeping)

15:28.833 --> 15:31.433
Okay, okay, Platanito,
we get it; you're a clown.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.067
Listen, I brought some
good stories

15:33.067 --> 15:34.533
that show my pride
in the Latino community.

15:40.333 --> 15:41.367
(laughing)

15:52.567 --> 15:54.067
What, what is,
what is he saying?

15:54.133 --> 15:55.633
He wants me to guest
host the show.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.433
Okay, I get it, I get it.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.767
He wants me to
do it in Spanish.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.067
No.

16:01.100 --> 16:02.500
(laughing)

16:02.567 --> 16:05.733
My suits will fit you,
they're baggy.

16:09.167 --> 16:11.067
Ladies and gentlemen!
(theme music playing)

16:11.100 --> 16:13.967
Welcome to the Platanito show!

16:14.067 --> 16:15.433
(cheering and applause)

16:15.500 --> 16:20.567
Standing in for Platanito,
it's Mr. George Lopez!

16:22.600 --> 16:23.533
(laughing)

16:26.433 --> 16:28.233
All right!

16:29.767 --> 16:31.067
(music ends)

16:31.100 --> 16:33.133
(laughing)

16:35.233 --> 16:37.367
Hey, Platanito could not
make it here tonight.

16:37.433 --> 16:39.267
So, you're stuck with me.

16:43.733 --> 16:44.700
(laughing)

16:44.767 --> 16:46.500
Was that my manager? Ay.

16:46.567 --> 16:48.133
So, I rolled over
in bed this morning,

16:48.200 --> 16:49.367
and I told Donald Trump,

16:49.433 --> 16:51.533
you gotta quit
hogging the sheets!

16:51.600 --> 16:52.533
(laughing)

16:52.600 --> 16:53.967
You know, Donald Trump?

16:54.067 --> 16:55.900
Ay, wey.

16:55.967 --> 16:57.500
Oh, my God, this is hard.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.633
(laughing)

17:00.700 --> 17:02.767
Oh!

17:02.833 --> 17:04.767
Excuse me, I think...

17:04.833 --> 17:06.100
the menudo's backing up on me.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.200
(horn honks)
(laughter)

17:08.267 --> 17:09.600
(horn honking)

17:09.667 --> 17:13.167
(laughter)

17:13.233 --> 17:15.400
Speaking of Trump,
he's a real son of a (honk).

17:15.467 --> 17:17.767
(laughter)
He can kiss my (honks).

17:17.833 --> 17:20.100
When he said he was gonna drain
the swamp,

17:20.167 --> 17:21.767
I didn't know
he was gonna take a (honk)

17:21.833 --> 17:23.633
all over the United States.

17:23.700 --> 17:24.767
(honking)

17:24.833 --> 17:26.667
(laughter and applause)

17:28.533 --> 17:30.900
I didn't realize the censor
spoke English!

17:30.967 --> 17:32.800
(laughter)
(honking)

17:32.867 --> 17:34.467
Oh, I scared myself, hey!

17:34.533 --> 17:36.433
All these pictures
of me and Donald Trump

17:36.500 --> 17:38.567
vacationing together...
(laughing)

17:38.633 --> 17:40.767
I might be a clown,
ay, wey...

17:40.833 --> 17:42.400
But I'm not that big of a clown.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.100
And you know I've been getting
a lot of heat

17:44.167 --> 17:46.567
because I defended
the first amendment.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.433
Freedom of Speech!
(honking)

17:48.500 --> 17:50.200
How many of you like
freedom of speech?

17:50.267 --> 17:51.667
(cheering and applause)

17:51.733 --> 17:53.467
So, if you like
freedom of speech...

17:53.533 --> 17:54.700
(honking)

17:54.767 --> 17:56.133
Listo!

17:56.200 --> 17:57.467
Get ready!

17:57.533 --> 17:59.100
Donald Trump is a Mexican,
that's right.

17:59.167 --> 18:00.833
He's got kids from
three different women

18:00.900 --> 18:03.233
and he doesn't pay taxes!

18:03.300 --> 18:05.500
(cheering and applause)

18:05.567 --> 18:09.300
**

18:12.933 --> 18:14.467
(chuckling)
That was great.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.933
Odd, disconcerting,
but great.

18:17.067 --> 18:19.533
And it's already trending
across Latin platforms.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.133
Really, oh, that's perfect.
Yeah.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.600
In fact, Platanito's
producers approached me

18:23.667 --> 18:26.333
about the possibility
of you replacing him.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.600
Really?
Mm-hmm.

18:27.667 --> 18:28.600
And makeup and all?

18:28.667 --> 18:29.900
Ah, I'm not sure
I wanna do that.

18:29.967 --> 18:31.633
Oh, I am sure I don't
want you to do that.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.100
But this is really great
for "Valleys."

18:39.700 --> 18:42.467
Platanito, I'm not trying
to take your show.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.600
Do I even want
a translation?

18:48.667 --> 18:51.367
Just be glad you took
French in high school.

18:51.433 --> 18:52.167
Sorry.

18:52.233 --> 18:54.167
(speaking Spanish)

18:54.233 --> 18:55.367
Kiss my kiwis!

18:55.433 --> 18:56.600
How do you know
I took French?

18:56.667 --> 18:59.100
Now, come on, seriously...
Come on!

18:59.167 --> 19:01.367
(laughing)

19:03.133 --> 19:04.733
Oh, man, did you see it?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.200
The clown act?

19:06.267 --> 19:07.733
Unfortunately, yes.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.367
Can you unsee it?

19:09.433 --> 19:11.200
No, George,
you can't unsee things.

19:11.267 --> 19:14.200
But, more importantly,
I saw grill sales go up,

19:14.267 --> 19:16.167
and I like that a lot.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.400
(chuckling)

19:19.267 --> 19:21.400
We're all alone.

19:23.733 --> 19:25.867
Wait a minute,
all the customers are gone.

19:25.933 --> 19:27.433
As are all the employees.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.533
I sent everyone home.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.667
It's one of the, uh,
perks of ownership.

19:37.933 --> 19:40.600
It's nice.
Yeah.

19:43.533 --> 19:45.233
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

19:45.300 --> 19:47.500
* That's right, come on,
come on, come on *

19:47.567 --> 19:49.500
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

19:49.567 --> 19:52.100
* Come on (oh!),
Come on (oh!) *

19:52.167 --> 19:55.900
**

20:00.200 --> 20:02.167
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:02.233 --> 20:04.533
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:04.600 --> 20:06.933
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up **

20:07.000 --> 20:10.733
**
