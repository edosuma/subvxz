"LAST WEEK TONIGHT"!

00:37.103 --> 00:37.937
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:38.004 --> 00:39.005
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:39.072 --> 00:40.039
US.

00:40.106 --> 00:41.040
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:41.107 --> 00:42.642
THE WEEK, WHICH HAS BEEN BUSY --

00:42.709 --> 00:43.977
THE G20 MET, COVID SHOTS FOR

00:44.043 --> 00:45.145
CHILDREN WERE APPROVED, AND

00:45.211 --> 00:46.846

00:46.913 --> 00:47.881
DAMAGING REVELATIONS FROM

NOW META.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.158

00:58.224 --> 00:59.192
I MEAN, THAT IS STUPID FOR

00:59.259 --> 01:00.326
SEVERAL REASONS.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.729
FIRST, META IS A TERRIBLE NAME.

01:02.796 --> 01:03.663
IT BELONGS IN THE BAD NAME HALL

01:03.730 --> 01:04.998
OF FAME ALONGSIDE

01:05.064 --> 01:06.533
RUTH'S CHRIS STEAKHOUSE, NOOM,

01:06.599 --> 01:11.004
AND "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

01:11.070 --> 01:12.071
BUT ALSO, YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE

01:12.138 --> 01:13.006
YOUR NAME TO COVER UP THE THINGS

01:13.072 --> 01:13.640
THAT YOU'RE ASHAMED OF.

01:13.706 --> 01:14.774
OTHERWISE, YEARS AGO, THE POPE

01:14.841 --> 01:15.308
WOULD'VE RESPONDED TO THE

01:15.375 --> 01:16.075
CHURCH'S SCANDALS BY SAYING,

01:16.142 --> 01:16.943
"GOOD NEWS, GUYS: WE'RE NO

01:17.010 --> 01:17.744
LONGER THE CATHOLIC CHURCH --

01:17.811 --> 01:19.979
SAY HELLO TO 'HALO.'

01:20.046 --> 01:21.047
I REALLY THINK THAT SHOULD FIX

01:21.114 --> 01:21.681
EVERYTHING.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.982
DON'T WORRY, WE SHIPPED THE

01:23.049 --> 01:25.285
OLD NAME OFF TO ANOTHER PARISH."

01:25.351 --> 01:30.924
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

01:30.990 --> 01:32.025
CONGRESS TONIGHT, WHICH SPENT

01:32.091 --> 01:32.926
THE WEEK ON TWO THINGS:

01:32.992 --> 01:33.660
FIRST, CELEBRATING HALLOWEEN,

01:33.726 --> 01:34.294
WITH MITT ROMNEY DRESSING UP AS

01:34.360 --> 01:35.161
TED LASSO, QUOTING "FRIDAY NIGHT

01:35.228 --> 01:36.763
LIGHTS" FOR NO CLEAR REASON, AND

01:36.830 --> 01:37.897
EVEN SHARING BISCUITS WITH

01:37.964 --> 01:39.432
KYRSTEN SINEMA, IN A MOVE THAT

01:39.499 --> 01:40.500
FELT VERY "HOMEROOM TEACHERS

01:40.567 --> 01:41.434
DRESS AS THE MOST POPULAR KIDS

01:41.501 --> 01:42.435
IN SCHOOL."

01:42.502 --> 01:44.437
YOU THINK YOU'RE IN

01:44.504 --> 01:46.005
ON IT, BUT YOU'RE VERY MUCH NOT.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.240
BUT THE OTHER MAJOR ACTION

01:47.307 --> 01:48.274
CONCERNED BIDEN'S SIGNATURE

01:48.341 --> 01:49.576
SPENDING PLAN, WHICH APPEARS TO

01:49.642 --> 01:51.878
BE TAKING ITS FINAL SHAPE.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.046
>> THE PRESIDENT OUTLINING A

01:53.112 --> 01:55.982
$1.75 TRILLION PLAN TO PROVIDE

01:56.049 --> 01:57.784
FREE UNIVERSAL PRE-K FOR KIDS

01:57.851 --> 01:59.419
AND EXTEND THE CHILD TAX CREDIT

01:59.486 --> 02:00.653
FOR FAMILIES.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.654
IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE MONEY FOR

02:01.721 --> 02:03.056
CHILDCARE AND ELDERCARE AND

02:03.122 --> 02:04.691
EXPAND MEDICARE TO COVER

02:04.757 --> 02:06.426
HEARING, AND IT WOULD SET ASIDE

02:06.493 --> 02:08.628
MORE THAN A HALF-TRILLION

02:08.695 --> 02:09.028
DOLLARS TO COMBAT

02:09.095 --> 02:10.096
CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.164
>> John: YEAH, THERE IS A LOT IN

02:11.231 --> 02:12.365
BUILD BACK BETTER --

02:12.432 --> 02:13.500
UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH, NONE OF

02:13.566 --> 02:14.634
IT INCLUDES CHANGING THE NAME TO

02:14.701 --> 02:15.635
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SOUND

02:15.702 --> 02:17.637
LIKE A GOLD'S GYM PROMOTIONAL

02:17.704 --> 02:18.972
OFFER.

02:19.038 --> 02:21.107
BUT WHILE WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN

02:21.174 --> 02:22.842
THERE IS GREAT, IT'S HARD NOT TO

02:22.909 --> 02:24.043
BE INFURIATED BY JUST HOW MUCH

02:24.110 --> 02:25.578
HAS BEEN CUT OUT.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.046
PAID FAMILY LEAVE, FREE

02:27.113 --> 02:28.047

02:28.114 --> 02:29.148

02:30.683 --> 02:32.151
NEGOTIATIONS.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.753
SO SOME OF BIDEN'S CORNERSTONE

02:33.820 --> 02:35.655
PROMISES HAVE NOW GONE, AND

02:35.722 --> 02:36.589
BASICALLY JUST LIKE THAT...

>> I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

02:51.404 --> 02:52.038
I'M SO SORRY.

02:52.105 --> 02:52.705

02:52.772 --> 02:53.473

02:53.540 --> 02:53.940
AT A WORSE TIME, JOHN.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.141
I'M ABOUT TO GO

02:55.208 --> 02:55.542
TRICK OR TREATING.

02:55.608 --> 02:56.109
>> OH, THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS

02:56.175 --> 02:57.143
REALLY FUN, GEORGE.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.077

02:59.312 --> 03:00.113
>> John: OH.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.147
OKAY.

03:01.214 --> 03:01.814
WHERE WAS I?

03:01.881 --> 03:02.882
OH, THAT'S RIGHT:

03:02.949 --> 03:03.650
PAID FAMILY LEAVE

03:03.716 --> 03:04.317
LOOKS TO BE GONE FROM

03:04.384 --> 03:05.451
BUILD BACK BETTER.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.052

03:06.119 --> 03:06.853
FOR WHY HE COULD NOT SUPPORT IT

03:06.920 --> 03:07.554
WAS PRETTY WEAK.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.588
>> I WANT TO WORK WITH EVERYONE,

03:08.655 --> 03:09.322
AS LONG AS WE CAN START PAYING

03:09.389 --> 03:09.756
FOR THINGS.

03:09.822 --> 03:10.757
THAT'S ALL.

03:10.823 --> 03:11.724
I CAN'T PUT THIS BURDEN ON MY

03:11.791 --> 03:12.759
GRANDCHILDREN.

03:12.825 --> 03:14.127
I'VE GOT TEN GRANDCHILDREN, AND

03:14.193 --> 03:15.929
I'LL BE -- I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

>> John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

03:16.996 --> 03:18.364
ABOUT?

03:18.431 --> 03:19.766
WE CAN'T HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE

03:19.832 --> 03:21.367
BECAUSE OF YOUR GRANDKIDS?

03:21.434 --> 03:22.035
YOU CAN'T JUST USE YOUR

03:22.101 --> 03:23.169
OFFSPRING AS AN EXCUSE FOR YOUR

03:23.236 --> 03:24.137
BAD DECISIONS.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.538
YOU'RE NOT TED CRUZ.

03:25.605 --> 03:26.306
WHAT?

03:26.372 --> 03:27.473
HIS DAUGHTERS WERE COLD!

03:27.540 --> 03:28.775
THEY WANTED A VACATION AND THEY

03:28.841 --> 03:31.611
WERE COLD.

03:31.678 --> 03:37.884
AND IF COST WAS THE ISSUE, IT

03:37.951 --> 03:39.118
DOES NOT HELP THAT A PROPOSED

03:39.185 --> 03:39.786
WAY TO RAISE REVENUE, A

03:39.852 --> 03:40.420
"BILLIONAIRES TAX," WAS ALSO

03:40.486 --> 03:41.120
SCRAPPED IN THE FINAL

03:41.187 --> 03:41.955
NEGOTIATING PUSH, FOLLOWING

03:42.021 --> 03:42.589
COMPLAINTS FROM, AMONG OTHERS,

03:42.655 --> 03:43.656
ELON MUSK, WHO TWEETED,

03:43.723 --> 03:44.424
"EVENTUALLY, THEY RUN OUT OF

03:44.490 --> 03:45.491
OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY AND THEN

03:45.558 --> 03:47.026
THEY COME FOR YOU."

03:47.093 --> 03:48.394
WHICH IS ACTUALLY A PARAPHRASE

03:48.461 --> 03:49.762
OF A FAMOUS MARGARET THATCHER

03:49.829 --> 03:50.897
QUOTE ABOUT SOCIALISM, AND I

03:50.964 --> 03:52.865
ONLY HOPE HIS NEXT THATCHERISM

03:52.932 --> 03:54.167
INCLUDES MY PERSONAL FAVORITE OF

03:54.233 --> 03:55.468
HERS: "I AM DEAD AND HAVE GONE

03:55.535 --> 03:58.171
TO HELL."

03:58.237 --> 03:59.606
BUT IT WASN'T JUST ELON MUSK.

03:59.672 --> 04:00.707
HERE'S KYRSTEN SINEMA'S SCENE

04:00.773 --> 04:01.708
PARTNER, MITT ROMNEY, MAKING HIS

04:01.774 --> 04:03.910
CASE AGAINST THE TAX:

04:03.977 --> 04:04.944
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT

04:05.011 --> 04:05.778
A GOOD IDEA TO TELL

04:05.845 --> 04:06.546
BILLIONAIRES, "DON'T COME TO

04:06.613 --> 04:07.981
AMERICA, DON'T START YOUR

04:08.047 --> 04:09.983
BUSINESS HERE," BUT NUMBER TWO,

04:10.049 --> 04:11.351
YOU'RE GONNA TAX PEOPLE NOT WHEN

04:11.417 --> 04:12.418
THEY SELL SOMETHING, BUT JUST

04:12.485 --> 04:13.453
WHEN THEY OWN IT AND THE VALUE

04:13.519 --> 04:14.554
GOES UP.

04:14.621 --> 04:15.622
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

04:15.688 --> 04:17.590
PEOPLE ARE -- THESE

04:17.657 --> 04:18.758
MULTIBILLIONAIRES -- ARE GOING

04:18.825 --> 04:19.626
TO LOOK AND SAY, "I DON'T WANT

04:19.692 --> 04:21.427
TO INVEST IN THE STOCK MARKET

04:21.494 --> 04:24.230
BECAUSE AS THAT GOES UP, I'M

04:24.297 --> 04:25.331
GOING TO GET TAXED.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.165
SO MAYBE I WILL INSTEAD INVEST

04:26.232 --> 04:27.767
IN A RANCH OR IN PAINTINGS OR

04:27.834 --> 04:30.870
THINGS THAT DON'T BUILD JOBS AND

04:30.937 --> 04:31.471
CREATE A STRONGER ECONOMY.

04:31.537 --> 04:33.973
>> John: OKAY, NOT TO SOUND TOO

04:34.040 --> 04:34.907
MUCH LIKE MITT'S HERO TED LASSO,

04:34.974 --> 04:35.775
BUT MITT MUST BE MADE OF WOOD

04:35.842 --> 04:36.809
AND YAPPING ON THE HOUR, BECAUSE

04:36.876 --> 04:37.610
THAT MAN IS A CUCKOO LIKE A

04:37.677 --> 04:38.778
CLOCK.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.079
IS HE DORA THE EXPLORER ON AN

04:40.146 --> 04:40.747
ACID TRIP?

04:40.813 --> 04:42.215
BECAUSE HE JUST CAN'T STOP

04:42.281 --> 04:44.717
LICKING BOOTS.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.020
AND AT THE RISK OF STATING THE

04:47.086 --> 04:48.588
OBVIOUS HERE, BILLIONAIRES

04:48.655 --> 04:49.889
ALREADY BUY RANCHES AND

04:49.956 --> 04:51.891
PAINTINGS AND DINOSAUR BONES

04:51.958 --> 04:53.159
THEY HAVE NO USE FOR -- WHY?

04:53.226 --> 04:53.893
'CAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MUCH

04:53.960 --> 04:55.628
FUCKING MONEY!

04:55.695 --> 04:56.963
THERE LITERALLY AREN'T ENOUGH

04:57.030 --> 04:57.997
THINGS ON THIS PLANET FOR THEM

04:58.064 --> 05:00.867
TO BUY.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.969
THAT IS WHY THEY'RE ALL RACING

05:03.036 --> 05:03.670
TO SPACE.

05:03.736 --> 05:04.604
WHOEVER LANDS ON MARS FIRST

05:04.671 --> 05:05.772
GETS IT.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.040
IT DOES SEEM MANY POLITICIANS

05:07.106 --> 05:07.940
WOULD RATHER PRIORITIZE THE

05:08.007 --> 05:08.441
HYPOTHETICAL THREAT TO A

05:08.508 --> 05:09.509
BILLIONAIRE'S BANK ACCOUNT ABOVE

05:09.575 --> 05:10.410
ALL ELSE.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.878
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW OUR WORLD

05:11.944 --> 05:13.379
WORKS NOW.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.014
POLITICIANS TWEET ABOUT

05:15.081 --> 05:16.382
COSPLAYING AS TV'S NICEST GUY

05:16.449 --> 05:21.154
WHILE OPPOSING PROGRAMS THAT

05:21.220 --> 05:21.754
COULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE

05:21.821 --> 05:22.488
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

05:22.555 --> 05:23.089
AND THE SCARIEST TRICK THIS

05:23.156 --> 05:23.956

05:24.023 --> 05:24.657
PEOPLE KEEP FUCKING FALLING FOR

05:24.724 --> 05:25.658
IT.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.894
AND NOW THIS.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.028
>> Announcer: AND NOW, ONCE

06:43.069 --> 06:46.539
MEANS THE FIRST SHOW TO COVER

06:46.606 --> 06:47.774
THIS SUBJECT -- MANY HAVE TRIED,

06:47.840 --> 06:48.574
NONE MORE MEMORABLY THAN THE

06:48.641 --> 06:49.375
CRIMINALLY CANCELED

06:49.442 --> 06:50.143
"TYRA BANKS SHOW."

06:50.209 --> 06:51.177

06:51.244 --> 06:51.944
THEIR LIVES ARE REALLY LIKE AND

06:52.011 --> 06:53.012
WALK A DAY IN THEIR SHOES, NO

06:53.079 --> 06:55.148
MAKEUP, NO LIGHTS, NOTHING BUT

06:55.214 --> 06:57.583
ME AND THE STREET.

06:57.650 --> 06:58.618
I STOPPED AT TWO KIDS IN THE

06:58.684 --> 07:01.988
STREET PLAYING BALL.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.056
HI, MY NAME IS TYRA.

07:04.123 --> 07:05.491
HI, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

>> FRANKLIN.

07:12.732 --> 07:13.733
MUCH GOING ON THERE, BUT I WANT

07:13.800 --> 07:14.300
TO FOCUS ON FRANKLIN'S FACE.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.134
THAT IS THE FACE OF A KID WHO'S

07:15.201 --> 07:15.902
DEFINITELY FIGURED OUT THE

07:15.968 --> 07:17.036
SECRET IDENTITY OF THE WOMAN WHO

07:17.103 --> 07:18.404
HAD A CAMERA CREW, LOOKED LIKE

07:18.471 --> 07:19.939
TYRA BANKS, AND INTRODUCED

07:20.006 --> 07:21.440
HERSELF SAYING, "MY NAME IS

07:21.507 --> 07:23.709
TYRA."

07:23.776 --> 07:24.877
BUT DESPITE TYRA'S BEST EFFORTS,

07:24.944 --> 07:25.878
HOMELESSNESS IS STILL A HUGE

07:25.945 --> 07:27.513

EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN

07:35.855 --> 07:39.926
AMERICA.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.294
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT IS LIKELY

07:41.360 --> 07:42.061
WAY MORE THAN THAT, BECAUSE THAT

07:42.128 --> 07:43.830
ANNUAL COUNT ONLY INCLUDES

07:43.896 --> 07:45.531
PEOPLE THAT SURVEYORS COULD FIND

09:59.799 --> 10:00.566
FOCUSING ON HOMELESSNESS ARE

10:00.633 --> 10:01.467
PRESENTED SOLELY THROUGH THE

10:01.534 --> 10:02.068
LENS OF HOW IT AFFECTS THOSE

10:02.134 --> 10:04.203
WITH HOMES.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.237
WHEN IN REALITY, IT'S OBVIOUSLY

10:05.304 --> 10:06.272
THE PEOPLE WITHOUT THEM WHO NEED

10:06.339 --> 10:07.773
THE REAL HELP.

10:09.742 --> 10:10.843
WELL HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO

10:13.346 --> 10:15.715
>> WE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE THROW

10:15.781 --> 10:19.852
GLASS BOTTLES FROM THE CARS AT

10:19.919 --> 10:22.989
OUR TENTS AND SAID, "YOU ALL

10:23.055 --> 10:24.490

10:24.557 --> 10:26.926
YOU ALL NEED TO GET A JOB.

>> John: RIGHT.

10:38.571 --> 10:39.372
AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY HORRIBLE.

10:39.438 --> 10:40.439
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, NO ONE

10:40.506 --> 10:41.640
SCREAMING OUT OF A CAR WINDOW

10:41.707 --> 10:42.241
HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING

10:42.308 --> 10:44.610
WORTHWHILE.

10:44.677 --> 10:45.511
IT'S LIKE GIVING A EULOGY

10:45.578 --> 10:46.145
THROUGH FLASH MOB.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.315
THE METHOD OF DELIVERY ALONE IS

10:49.382 --> 10:50.916
JUST IMMEDIATELY DISQUALIFYING.

10:50.983 --> 10:51.484
THE STORY OF HOMELESSNESS IN

10:51.550 --> 10:52.218
THIS COUNTRY IS GROUNDED IN A

10:52.284 --> 10:53.619
FAILURE OF PERCEPTION,

10:53.686 --> 10:54.553
COMPOUNDED BY FAILURES OF

10:54.620 --> 10:57.156
POLICY.

10:57.223 --> 10:58.891
SO TONIGHT LET'S LOOK AT THE WAY

10:58.958 --> 10:59.792
HOMELESSNESS IS TALKED ABOUT,

10:59.859 --> 11:00.626
HOW THE PROBLEM IS CURRENTLY

11:00.693 --> 11:01.994
BEING MADE WORSE, AND WHAT CAN

11:02.061 --> 11:03.896
ACTUALLY HELP.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.699
AND LIKE SO MANY THINGS, THE

11:06.766 --> 11:07.767
MODERN VERSION OF THIS ISSUE WAS

11:07.833 --> 11:08.734
TURBOCHARGED BY RONALD REAGAN,

11:08.801 --> 11:10.136
WHO CAME TO POWER AT A TIME WHEN

11:10.202 --> 11:14.607
HOMELESSNESS WAS INCREASING, AND

11:14.673 --> 11:17.743
MADE THE PROBLEM FAR WORSE BY

11:17.810 --> 11:18.844
CUTTING PROGRAMS FOR THE POOR

11:18.911 --> 11:21.714
AND SLASHING HOUSING SUBSIDIES

11:21.781 --> 11:21.947
BY 75%.

11:22.014 --> 11:22.748
MAKING IT PRETTY GALLING THAT

11:22.815 --> 11:23.382
REAGAN REGULARLY MADE ARGUMENTS

11:23.449 --> 11:25.818
LIKE THIS:

11:27.987 --> 11:29.121
EVEN IN THE BEST OF TIMES, AND

11:29.188 --> 11:29.922
THAT IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

11:29.989 --> 11:34.660
SLEEPING ON THE GRATES.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.462
THE HOMELESS WHO ARE HOMELESS,

11:36.529 --> 11:36.996

11:37.063 --> 11:37.730

11:38.831 --> 11:39.765

11:49.141 --> 11:49.975

11:50.042 --> 11:51.343
ON HOMELESSNESS ARE NEAR THE TOP

11:51.410 --> 11:51.844
OF THAT LIST.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.512
AND THAT NOTION -- THAT

11:53.579 --> 11:54.613
HOMELESSNESS ISN'T RELATED TO

11:54.680 --> 11:55.381
ECONOMIC POLICIES, BUT SIMPLY

11:55.448 --> 11:56.048
REFLECTS THE PROBLEMS OF THE

11:56.115 --> 11:57.817
INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING IT --

HERE'S DR. DREW, OF ALL PEOPLE,

12:03.222 --> 12:03.956
TALKING TO SETH GREEN, OF ALL

12:04.023 --> 12:05.724
PEOPLE, AND PUSHING BACK ON THE

12:05.791 --> 12:06.792
NOTION THAT THE HOMELESS CRISIS

12:06.859 --> 12:10.029
IN L.A. MIGHT HAVE ANYTHING TO

12:10.096 --> 12:11.163
DO WITH A SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE

12:11.230 --> 12:12.698
HOUSING:

12:12.765 --> 12:13.332
>> THIS ISN'T A HOUSING PROBLEM.

12:13.399 --> 12:13.632
>> IT'S NOT?

12:13.699 --> 12:14.667
>> NO, NO.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.868
THAT'S A HOAX, THAT'S A HOAX

12:15.935 --> 12:17.169
BEING PERPETRATED BY THE

12:17.236 --> 12:18.504
GOVERNMENT HERE LOCALLY, THEY

12:18.571 --> 12:19.638
NEED TO STOP.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.350

12:31.417 --> 12:32.351
IT'S A HOAX.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.552
SO IT'S A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS

12:33.619 --> 12:35.688

12:40.259 --> 12:41.994
I CERTAINLY DON'T SEE WHY WE

12:42.061 --> 12:42.795
WOULDN'T INNATELY TRUST DR. DREW

12:46.132 --> 12:47.900
THERE:

12:47.967 --> 12:49.001
SET ASIDE THE NONSENSE THAT

UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS DON'T

12:51.103 --> 12:52.238
EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS --

12:52.304 --> 12:53.572
BECAUSE EXPERTS WILL TELL YOU

12:53.639 --> 12:55.074
THAT THEY VERY MUCH DO,

12:55.141 --> 12:55.674
THEY'RE JUST LESS

12:55.741 --> 12:57.543
LIKELY TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF

12:57.610 --> 12:58.310
SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE

12:58.377 --> 13:00.746
"UNDOCUMENTED" THING.

13:00.813 --> 13:01.447
INSTEAD, LET'S ADDRESS THE

13:01.514 --> 13:02.248
NOTION THAT ALL THIS IS DOWN TO

13:02.314 --> 13:03.749
MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.384
BECAUSE, YES, MANY WHO ARE

13:05.451 --> 13:06.152
HOMELESS DO STRUGGLE WITH BOTH

13:06.218 --> 13:07.887
THOSE THINGS -- AND THOSE PEOPLE

13:07.953 --> 13:09.722
ARE OFTEN THE MOST VISIBLE --

13:09.788 --> 13:12.057
BUT BY NO MEANS ALL OF THEM.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.425
ALSO, IN MANY CASES, THOSE

13:13.492 --> 13:15.694
STRUGGLES CAN BE THE RESULT OF

13:15.761 --> 13:17.096
BEING HOMELESS AND NOT THE CAUSE

13:17.163 --> 13:17.763
OF IT.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.099
THE TRUTH IS, THERE ARE MANY

13:20.166 --> 13:21.200
REASONS SOMEONE MIGHT FIND

13:21.267 --> 13:22.168
THEMSELVES WITHOUT HOUSING:

13:22.234 --> 13:22.801
MEDICAL DEBT, JOB LOSS, FLEEING

13:22.868 --> 13:23.969
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, BEING KICKED

13:24.036 --> 13:24.970
OUT OF THEIR HOME BECAUSE THEIR

13:25.037 --> 13:27.072
PARENTS DON'T APPROVE OF THEIR

13:27.139 --> 13:27.873
SEXUALITY, BEING RECENTLY

13:27.940 --> 13:29.375
RELEASED FROM PRISON, OR JUST

13:29.441 --> 13:31.043
THE OVERRIDING FACT THAT HOUSING

13:31.110 --> 13:31.911
COSTS ARE RISING MUCH FASTER

13:31.977 --> 13:34.313
THAN WAGES.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.115
CURRENTLY 70% OF ALL EXTREMELY

13:36.182 --> 13:37.950
LOW-INCOME FAMILIES ARE SPENDING

13:38.017 --> 13:39.885
MORE THAN HALF THEIR INCOME ON

13:39.952 --> 13:41.020
RENT.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.188
AND ONLY 37 AFFORDABLE AND

13:42.254 --> 13:44.123
AVAILABLE HOMES EXIST FOR EVERY

13:44.190 --> 13:45.624
100 EXTREMELY LOW-INCOME RENTER

13:45.691 --> 13:47.226
HOUSEHOLDS.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.727
AND THAT'S A STARTLINGLY LOW

13:48.794 --> 13:51.030
NUMBER, CONSIDERING JUST HOW

13:51.096 --> 13:53.132
MUCH THIS COUNTRY LOVES WATCHING

13:53.199 --> 13:54.099
TV SHOWS ABOUT HOMES.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.467
LITTLE HOMES.

13:55.534 --> 13:56.135
HUMONGO HOMES.

13:56.202 --> 14:01.440
HOMES FOR GHOSTS.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.977
AND HOMES REMODELED BY

14:05.044 --> 14:06.612
WEIRDO TWINS WHO DEFINITELY

14:06.679 --> 14:07.246
SHOWER TOGETHER, TO NAME JUST A

14:07.313 --> 14:07.713
FEW OF THEM.

14:07.780 --> 14:08.714
THE POINT HERE IS, IT DOESN'T

14:08.781 --> 14:09.548
TAKE MUCH FOR PEOPLE TO SUDDENLY

14:09.615 --> 14:10.249
FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT STABLE

14:10.316 --> 14:11.984
HOUSING, AS THIS WOMAN FOUND

14:12.051 --> 14:12.985
OUT.

14:13.052 --> 14:13.852
>> TWO YEARS AGO, PRISCILLA HAD

14:13.919 --> 14:15.554
A FULL-TIME JOB AT A HEALTH

14:15.621 --> 14:16.822
CLINIC FOR THE HOMELESS.

14:16.889 --> 14:17.856
HER HUSBAND, RYAN, STAYED HOME

14:17.923 --> 14:20.492
TO CARE FOR THEIR TWO SONS.

14:20.559 --> 14:24.263
THE YOUNGEST HAS SEVERE AUTISM.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.199
THEY LIVED ON A TIGHT BUDGET AND

14:27.266 --> 14:28.267
THEN THEIR LANDLORD RAISED THE

14:28.334 --> 14:30.069
RENT $150.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.404
>> THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR A

14:32.471 --> 14:33.606
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE PAYCHECK

14:33.672 --> 14:36.709
BY PAYCHECK, AND WE LIVE LIKE

14:36.775 --> 14:37.843
THAT.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.278
>> THE FAMILY WAS EVICTED, AND

14:39.345 --> 14:40.145
IN A PLACE THEY NEVER IMAGINED:

14:40.212 --> 14:42.181
HOMELESS THEMSELVES, LIVING IN

14:42.248 --> 14:43.315
THEIR CAR.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.352
>> I WORK AT A HOMELESS CLINIC

14:46.418 --> 14:47.186
AND I'M HOMELESS.

14:47.253 --> 14:47.853
HOW THE HECK DOES THAT HAPPEN TO

14:47.920 --> 14:48.554
ME?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.990
>> John: YEAH, THAT IS AN AWFUL

14:51.056 --> 14:51.423
SITUATION TO BE IN.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.658
YOU NEVER WANT TO FIND YOURSELF

14:52.725 --> 14:54.193
SUDDENLY SAYING, "HOW DID THIS

14:54.260 --> 14:55.361
HAPPEN TO ME?"

14:55.427 --> 14:57.196
WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION BEING

14:57.263 --> 14:57.863
IF YOU'RE KNEE DEEP IN

14:57.930 --> 14:59.431
STANLEY TUCCI'S SHEETS.

14:59.498 --> 15:00.566
AND EVEN THEN, WHY QUESTION IT?

15:00.633 --> 15:02.167
YOU'RE SWIMMING IN TOOCH.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.236
POP A MINT.

15:04.303 --> 15:06.905
THIS IS GONNA BE A DELIGHT!

15:06.972 --> 15:09.041
SO DESPITE REAGAN'S CONFIDENCE,

15:09.108 --> 15:10.142
THERE CAN BE NOT MUCH CHOICE IN

15:10.209 --> 15:11.410
THE MATTER AT ALL.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.579
AS FOR THOSE OUTWARD SIGNS OF

15:13.646 --> 15:14.413
HOMELESSNESS THAT RAISE SUCH

15:14.480 --> 15:16.615
ALARM, THEY'RE TYPICALLY THE

15:16.682 --> 15:18.484
RESULT OF PUBLIC POLICY CHOICES

15:18.550 --> 15:19.685
WE'VE MADE.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.919
REMEMBER THAT WOMAN COMPLAINING

15:20.986 --> 15:22.354
ABOUT HUMAN SHIT?

15:22.421 --> 15:23.255
THAT'S ACTUALLY A COMMON THREAD

15:23.322 --> 15:24.923
IN COVERAGE OF THE HOMELESS.

15:24.990 --> 15:25.991
IN L.A., YOU CAN FIND MULTIPLE

15:26.058 --> 15:27.693
STORIES ABOUT HUMAN FECES NEAR

15:27.760 --> 15:32.765
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS.

15:32.831 --> 15:33.766
BUT IT'S WORTH KNOWING THERE IS

15:33.832 --> 15:34.900
A REASON FOR THAT.

15:34.967 --> 15:35.567
>> MOST OF THE CITY'S HUNDREDS

15:35.634 --> 15:36.635
OF ENCAMPMENTS ARE NOWHERE NEAR

15:36.702 --> 15:39.371
A PUBLIC TOILET.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.508
IN FACT, L.A. HAS ONLY 16 MOBILE

15:42.574 --> 15:43.842
TOILET STATIONS FOR ITS 36,000

15:43.909 --> 15:45.311
HOMELESS PEOPLE.

15:45.377 --> 15:47.046
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, WITH NO

15:47.112 --> 15:49.848
FUNDING FOR ROUND-THE-CLOCK

15:49.915 --> 15:50.983
SECURITY, THE CITY HAULS AWAY

15:51.050 --> 15:52.017
THESE TOILETS AT NIGHT, LEAVING

15:52.084 --> 15:53.519
THE HOMELESS NO CHOICE BUT TO GO

15:53.585 --> 15:57.723
ON THE STREETS.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.691
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK TO ALL OF

15:58.757 --> 15:59.325
THAT.

15:59.391 --> 16:00.092
FROM THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC

16:00.159 --> 16:01.327
TOILET STATIONS AVAILABLE BEING

16:01.393 --> 16:02.361
LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF BOND

16:02.428 --> 16:03.662
MOVIES TO SHUFFLING THOSE VERY

16:03.729 --> 16:05.230
MINIMAL TOILETS AWAY LIKE

16:05.297 --> 16:06.098
THEY'RE GOING TO TURN INTO A

16:06.165 --> 16:10.336
PUMPKIN AT MIDNIGHT.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.170
AND WHILE THAT CLIP IS FROM JUST

16:11.236 --> 16:11.770
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC -- WHICH

16:11.837 --> 16:13.105
PROMPTED CITY OFFICIALS TO

16:13.172 --> 16:13.906
INCREASE TOILET STATIONS --

16:13.972 --> 16:15.674
THERE ARE STILL CURRENTLY ONLY

16:15.741 --> 16:17.076
55 ACCESSIBLE 24/7.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.711
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU COMPLAIN

16:18.777 --> 16:20.112
ABOUT HUMAN SHIT IN THE STREET,

16:20.179 --> 16:21.146
MAYBE THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD

16:21.213 --> 16:21.914
BE LIKE IF SOMEONE PADLOCKED

16:21.980 --> 16:24.083
YOUR BATHROOM EVERY NIGHT.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.684
YOU, TOO, WOULD SUDDENLY BE

16:25.751 --> 16:27.486
GETTING REALLY CREATIVE, REALLY

16:27.553 --> 16:28.887
FAST.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.422
AND IT SEEMS THE IMPULSE BEHIND

16:30.489 --> 16:32.024
MANY LOCAL POLICIES SURROUNDING

16:32.091 --> 16:37.229
UNHOUSED PEOPLE ISN'T SO MUCH TO

16:37.296 --> 16:38.831
HELP THEM AS TO PUNISH THEM FOR

16:38.897 --> 16:40.132
THEIR EXISTENCE AND KEEP THEM

16:40.199 --> 16:41.400
OUT OF SIGHT.

16:41.467 --> 16:42.134
YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH

16:42.201 --> 16:43.369
"HOSTILE ARCHITECTURE," DESIGNED

16:43.435 --> 16:44.236
TO PREVENT HOMELESS PEOPLE FROM

16:44.303 --> 16:44.870
SITTING AND LYING ON CERTAIN

16:44.937 --> 16:45.804
PROPERTY.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.139
IT'S WHY YOU'LL SOMETIMES SEE

16:47.206 --> 16:48.040
SPIKES UNDER BRIDGES LIKE THIS,

16:48.107 --> 16:48.974
OR BENCHES WITH DIVIDERS TO

16:49.041 --> 16:51.043
PREVENT ANYONE LYING DOWN.

16:51.110 --> 16:51.877
AND ONE CITY WENT EVEN BEYOND

16:51.944 --> 16:54.146
ARCHITECTURE.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.748
>> A DEBATE RAGING OVER A

16:55.814 --> 16:56.815
FLORIDA CITY PLAYING CHILDREN'S

16:56.882 --> 16:58.650
MUSIC AT A PARK PAVILION AT

16:58.717 --> 16:59.218
NIGHT TO KEEP HOMELESS PEOPLE

16:59.284 --> 17:00.119
AWAY.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.221
PEOPLE SAY THE MUSIC ROTATES

17:02.287 --> 17:03.155
BETWEEN "BABY SHARK" AND THIS

17:03.222 --> 17:04.323
SONG.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.724
>> ♪ CHEESE, CHEESE ♪

17:05.791 --> 17:08.861
♪ IT'S RAINING TACOS ♪

17:08.927 --> 17:15.267
♪ RAINING TACOS ♪

17:15.334 --> 17:16.869
>> John: IT'S TRUE, THEY PUMPED

17:16.935 --> 17:18.637
THE SONG "RAINING TACOS" AT

17:18.704 --> 17:19.638
PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO

17:19.705 --> 17:20.406
SLEEP.

17:20.472 --> 17:21.306
WHICH IS INHUMANE.

17:21.373 --> 17:21.774
NO ONE DESERVES THAT.

17:21.840 --> 17:22.341
ALSO, AND THIS ISN'T THE KEY

17:22.408 --> 17:23.475
POINT -- THAT SONG DOESN'T

17:23.542 --> 17:24.910
DESERVE THAT, EITHER.

17:24.977 --> 17:25.544
BECAUSE IT IS A CERTIFIED

17:25.611 --> 17:28.580
BANGER.

17:28.647 --> 17:29.615
TAKE A LISTEN:

17:29.681 --> 17:30.649
>> ♪ IT'S RAINING TACOS ♪

17:30.716 --> 17:31.884

17:45.364 --> 17:45.631
>> John: STOP!

17:45.697 --> 17:48.801
STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.269
I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY YOU MORE,

17:50.335 --> 17:51.537
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, THIS SHOW

17:51.603 --> 17:53.305
WOULD THEN GET TOO FUN, I'D

17:53.372 --> 17:55.474
SPEND THE REST OF THE SHOW

17:55.541 --> 17:57.876
DANCING IN THE AISLES WITH YOU,

17:57.943 --> 17:58.777
AND ELLEN WOULD LITERALLY

17:58.844 --> 17:59.011
KILL ME.

17:59.077 --> 17:59.945
BUT IT'S NOT JUST SPIKES AND

18:00.012 --> 18:00.212
SONGS.

18:00.279 --> 18:01.780
MORE AND MORE CITY ORDINANCES

18:01.847 --> 18:02.448
HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE

18:02.514 --> 18:03.549
CRIMINALIZING BEHAVIORS

18:03.615 --> 18:05.884
ASSOCIATED WITH BEING HOMELESS.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.553
OVER THE COURSE OF 13 YEARS,

18:07.619 --> 18:09.455
CITY-WIDE BANS ON CAMPING HAVE

18:09.521 --> 18:10.989
INCREASED BY 92%, ON SITTING OR

18:11.056 --> 18:14.059
LYING BY 78%, ON LOITERING AND

18:14.126 --> 18:16.495
PANHANDLING BY 103%, AND ON

18:16.562 --> 18:21.567
LIVING IN VEHICLES BY 213%.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.902
SO WHEN YOU HEAR FEARMONGERING

18:23.969 --> 18:26.104
ABOUT RISING CRIME AMONG THE

18:26.171 --> 18:26.705
HOMELESS, IT'S WORTH ASKING IF

18:26.772 --> 18:27.673
THOSE CRIMES WERE ACTUALLY

18:27.739 --> 18:28.540
CRIMES OR JUST "SOMEONE SAT

18:28.607 --> 18:30.108
DOWN."

18:30.175 --> 18:31.610
TAKE KENNETH SHULTZ, A

18:31.677 --> 18:32.478
71-YEAR-OLD HOMELESS MAN WHO

18:32.544 --> 18:33.779
TOLD REPORTERS, "SOMETIMES I

18:33.846 --> 18:34.780
JUST GET EXHAUSTED, AND BOOM,

18:34.847 --> 18:35.681
SIT DOWN.

18:35.747 --> 18:36.415
THAT'S IT.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.550
YOU'RE TRESPASSING."

18:38.617 --> 18:39.885
IN THE NINE YEARS HE'S BEEN

18:39.952 --> 18:41.086
HOMELESS, HE'S BEEN CHARGED WITH

18:41.153 --> 18:43.789
TRESPASSING 96 TIMES AND HAS

18:43.856 --> 18:45.691
SPENT ONE OF EVERY THREE NIGHTS

18:45.757 --> 18:46.391
IN JAIL.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.993
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.228
IT MEANS HE'S SPENT THREE OF THE

18:49.294 --> 18:51.096
LAST NINE YEARS BEHIND BARS.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.931
IN WHAT WAY IS THAT MAN BEING

18:52.998 --> 18:58.237
HELPED?

18:58.303 --> 18:59.505
YOU CANNOT ARREST SOMEONE OUT OF

18:59.571 --> 19:00.138
HOMELESSNESS IN THE SAME WAY YOU

19:00.205 --> 19:00.672
CAN'T SING SOMEONE OUT OF

19:00.739 --> 19:01.440
BANKRUPTCY.

19:01.507 --> 19:05.110
ONE THING DOESN'T REMOTELY LEAD

19:05.177 --> 19:06.945
TO THE OTHER AND YOU'RE JUST

19:07.012 --> 19:07.546
GOING TO END UP MAKING THINGS

19:07.613 --> 19:07.746
WORSE.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.581
EVEN IF YOU'RE SINGING THIS:

19:09.648 --> 19:10.182
>> ♪ IT'S RAINING TACOS ♪

19:10.249 --> 19:11.550

19:11.617 --> 19:12.017
>> John: NOPE!

19:12.084 --> 19:12.551
NOPE!

19:12.618 --> 19:13.418
TURN IT OFF!

19:13.485 --> 19:14.953
I'M WARNING YOU -- ELLEN IS

19:15.020 --> 19:15.521
SHARPENING HER KNIVES AS WE

19:15.587 --> 19:16.121
SPEAK.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.089
SHE'LL DO IT.

19:17.155 --> 19:20.058
IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.793
AND CRIMINALIZING HOMELESSNESS

19:21.860 --> 19:23.662
EXPOSES ALREADY VULNERABLE

19:23.729 --> 19:24.596
POPULATIONS TO UNNECESSARY

19:24.663 --> 19:26.465
INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE.

19:26.532 --> 19:27.933
UNHOUSED PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE

19:28.000 --> 19:29.134
MORE LIKELY TO BE CITED,

19:29.201 --> 19:30.335
SEARCHED, AND HAVE PROPERTY

19:30.402 --> 19:31.770
TAKEN THAN WHITE PEOPLE

19:31.837 --> 19:32.771
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.239
AND THOSE WITH MULTIPLE

19:34.306 --> 19:35.807
MARGINALIZED IDENTITIES, LIKE

19:35.874 --> 19:37.509
LGBTQ+ PEOPLE OF COLOR, ARE EVEN

19:37.576 --> 19:39.511
MORE VULNERABLE TO THESE LAWS.

19:39.578 --> 19:40.779
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

19:40.846 --> 19:41.914
"HOLD ON, WHY DON'T HOMELESS

19:41.980 --> 19:43.849
PEOPLE JUST GO TO SHELTERS?"

19:43.916 --> 19:45.217
THERE CAN BE A LOT OF PROBLEMS

19:45.284 --> 19:46.451
WITH THAT.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.486
SOME CITIES SIMPLY DON'T HAVE

19:47.553 --> 19:49.755
ENOUGH BEDS FOR EVERYONE.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.123
IN OAKLAND, FOR EXAMPLE, IN

19:51.189 --> 19:52.724
2019, THERE WERE 457 BEDS

19:52.791 --> 19:53.959
AVAILABLE FOR MORE THAN 4,000

19:54.026 --> 19:55.794
UNHOUSED PEOPLE.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.129
MEANING THEY COULDN'T PROVIDE

19:57.195 --> 19:59.164
EVERYONE WITH A BED EVEN IF THEY

19:59.231 --> 20:01.033
WILLY WONKA'D THE SITUATION.

20:01.099 --> 20:02.200
AND IF I MAY, I'D ACTUALLY LIKE

20:02.267 --> 20:03.502
TO PAUSE AT THIS POINT FOR A

20:03.569 --> 20:06.672
QUICK TANGENT.

20:06.738 --> 20:07.506
SO PUT 40 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK,

20:07.573 --> 20:08.206
PLEASE.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.007
REGARDING THIS:

20:09.074 --> 20:10.442
I DON'T MIND CHARLIE'S

20:10.509 --> 20:11.643
GRANDPARENTS SLEEPING

20:11.710 --> 20:12.578
IN ONE BED.

20:12.644 --> 20:13.979
EVERYONE ALWAYS ASKS, "BUT WHAT

20:14.046 --> 20:14.913
ABOUT WHEN THEY HAVE TO FUCK?

20:14.980 --> 20:15.581
DO THEY FUCK SEPARATELY OR ALL

20:15.647 --> 20:16.848
DO IT TOGETHER?"

20:16.915 --> 20:17.716
TO WHICH I SAY, I DON'T CARE,

20:17.783 --> 20:19.184
AND I HOPE SO!

20:19.251 --> 20:20.852
THEY'RE NOT RELATED BY BLOOD.

20:20.919 --> 20:21.353
THEY'RE RELATED BY THEIR

20:21.420 --> 20:22.454
CHILDREN'S MARRIAGE.

20:22.521 --> 20:23.655
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THEY HAVE

20:23.722 --> 20:25.757
TO SHARE ONE RICKETY BED.

20:25.824 --> 20:26.725
GRANDPA GEORGE IS GOING TO

20:26.792 --> 20:28.694
WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO

20:28.760 --> 20:29.094
GRANDMA GEORGINA.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.162
THEY'VE SHARED A LIFE TOGETHER.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.463
AND GRANDPA JOE IS OBVIOUSLY

20:31.530 --> 20:32.731
GOING TO WANT TO GET IT IN

20:32.798 --> 20:42.441
GRANDMA JOSEPHINE.

20:42.507 --> 20:43.075
THAT'S THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD.

20:43.141 --> 20:44.076
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT, IF YOU

20:44.142 --> 20:44.743
DON'T INVITE THE COUPLE SLEEPING

20:44.810 --> 20:45.410
IN THE SAME BED TO JOIN IN, IT'S

20:45.477 --> 20:45.677
JUST RUDE.

20:45.744 --> 20:46.612
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU TALK SHIT

20:46.678 --> 20:47.546
ABOUT CHARLIE BUCKET'S ELDER'S

20:47.613 --> 20:47.980
SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES,

20:48.046 --> 20:48.780
ASK YOURSELF THIS:

20:48.847 --> 20:49.481
ARE THEY THE PROBLEM?

20:49.548 --> 20:50.148
OR WERE YOU RAISED IN A

20:50.215 --> 20:51.016
PURITANICAL SOCIETY THAT SHAMES

20:51.083 --> 20:51.617
ANY SEXUAL DEVIATION FROM THE

20:51.683 --> 20:52.250
"NORM"?

20:52.317 --> 20:56.355
[TIMER DINGS]

20:56.421 --> 20:57.322
OH, THAT'S MY TIME.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.523
THAT'S MY TIME.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.659
I'VE SAID MY PIECE.

21:00.726 --> 21:01.660
BACK TO THE SAD STUFF.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.261
THE POINT IS, SOME CITIES DON'T

21:03.328 --> 21:03.929
HAVE ENOUGH SHELTER BEDS.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.298
AND EVEN IN THOSE THAT HAVE

21:06.365 --> 21:07.299
MANY, LIKE HERE IN NEW YORK,

21:07.366 --> 21:08.133
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS AN OPTION FOR

21:08.200 --> 21:08.800
EVERYONE.

21:08.867 --> 21:09.901
SOME MIGHT NOT WANT TO SPLIT UP

21:09.968 --> 21:11.236
THEIR FAMILY OR PART WITH THEIR

21:11.303 --> 21:12.204
PETS OR ARE SIMPLY WARY OF

21:12.270 --> 21:13.872
BRINGING THEIR ONLY POSSESSIONS

21:13.939 --> 21:16.608
AROUND A ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS.

21:16.675 --> 21:17.209
BUT ALSO, THE KEY PROBLEM WITH

21:17.275 --> 21:19.144
SAYING "WHY DON'T THEY JUST GO

21:19.211 --> 21:19.811
TO SHELTERS?" IS THAT SHELTERS

21:19.878 --> 21:24.883
ARE ONLY A STOPGAP SOLUTION.

21:24.950 --> 21:25.584
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIVE IN A

21:25.651 --> 21:26.385
SHELTER, YOU JUST SLEEP IN ONE,

21:26.451 --> 21:28.720
AS THIS WOMAN POINTS OUT:

21:28.787 --> 21:30.288
>> IT'S VERY, VERY ROUGH.

21:30.355 --> 21:31.523
I WOULD RATHER STAY ON THE

21:31.590 --> 21:32.758
STREETS.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.126
AND THIS IS WHY I UNDERSTAND

21:34.192 --> 21:34.993
WHEN I SEE A LOT OF HOMELESS

21:35.060 --> 21:35.961
PEOPLE, WHY THEY'RE ON THE

21:36.028 --> 21:37.262
STREETS.

21:37.329 --> 21:38.764
THE SHELTER DEGRADES YOU.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.732
I WORK PART-TIME.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.800
I WENT FROM A FULL-TIME JOB TO A

21:41.867 --> 21:43.168
PART-TIME JOB, BEING IN THE

21:43.235 --> 21:44.936
SHELTER, BECAUSE THERE'S TOO

21:45.003 --> 21:47.339
MUCH GOING ON.

21:47.406 --> 21:48.140
I HAVE TO BE IN AT 8:00 EVERY

21:48.206 --> 21:49.741
NIGHT.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.475
IF I'M NOT IN AT 8:00, I LOSE

21:50.542 --> 21:52.177
THAT BED.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.145
YOU WAKE UP AT 5:00, YOU HAVE TO

21:53.211 --> 21:54.312
BE OUT OF THERE BY 7:00,

21:54.379 --> 21:55.914
REGARDLESS.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.783
>> John: YEAH.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.151
AN 8:00 P.M. CURFEW AND A

21:59.217 --> 22:01.386
7:00 A.M. KICK OUT THE DOOR.

22:01.453 --> 22:02.688
SO IF "PULLING YOURSELF UP BY

22:02.754 --> 22:04.122
YOUR BOOTSTRAPS" INVOLVES

22:04.189 --> 22:05.691
WORKING NIGHTS, I'M SORRY,

22:05.757 --> 22:07.392
YOU'RE SHIT OUT OF LUCK.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.393
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "NO,

22:08.460 --> 22:09.428
JOHN, SURELY A SHELTER

22:09.494 --> 22:10.095
EVENTUALLY HELPS PEOPLE GET BACK

22:10.162 --> 22:11.530
ON THEIR FEET.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.465
EVERYTHING WORTHWHILE IN LIFE

22:13.532 --> 22:14.066
TAKES TIME -- I READ THAT ON A

22:14.132 --> 22:18.570
PILLOW ONCE."

22:18.637 --> 22:20.872
WELL, THINK AGAIN, BECAUSE

22:20.939 --> 22:22.240
JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE

22:22.307 --> 22:23.875
PERSON WHO FILMED THAT WOMAN

22:23.942 --> 22:25.410
CAUGHT UP WITH HER ALMOST EIGHT

22:25.477 --> 22:25.711
YEARS LATER:

22:25.777 --> 22:26.812
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT GOING IN AND

22:26.878 --> 22:27.746
OUT OF THE SHELTER SYSTEM, AND

22:27.813 --> 22:28.480
THAT'S STILL HAPPENING.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.949
>> AND THAT'S STILL HAPPENING.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.085
THEY PLACE YOU, THEY LET YOU GO,

22:33.151 --> 22:34.786
THEY MOVE YOU, THEY LET YOU GO,

22:34.853 --> 22:36.755
THEY GET YOUR MONEY FROM THE

22:36.822 --> 22:37.656
GOVERNMENT, THEY LET YOU GO,

22:37.723 --> 22:40.392
AND YOU'RE STILL MISPLACED.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.393
>> John: YEAH, THE SHELTER

22:41.460 --> 22:42.194
SYSTEM HAS DONE NOTHING TO

22:42.260 --> 22:44.262
CHANGE HER CIRCUMSTANCE.

22:44.329 --> 22:45.530
AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT

22:45.597 --> 22:47.499
HERE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO

22:47.566 --> 22:48.100
UNDERSTAND JUST HOW HARD THAT

22:48.166 --> 22:49.568
CYCLE IS.

22:49.634 --> 22:50.702
I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE

22:50.769 --> 22:52.204
ALWAYS LIVED IN AN APARTMENT OR

22:52.270 --> 22:53.805
HOUSE OR, MOST RECENTLY, AN

22:53.872 --> 22:54.506
INFINITE WHITE VOID RUN BY AN

22:54.573 --> 22:56.374
ABUSIVE LANDLORD.

22:56.441 --> 23:00.445
THAT WAS HARD IN ITS OWN WAY,

23:00.512 --> 23:01.179
BUT IT WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO A

23:01.246 --> 23:02.981
POTENTIALLY LIFE-OR-DEATH GAME

23:03.048 --> 23:03.348
OF MUSICAL BEDS.

23:03.415 --> 23:04.583
SO IF ALL WE'VE MENTIONED SO FAR

23:04.649 --> 23:05.784
TONIGHT -- POKING HOMELESS

23:05.851 --> 23:07.185
PEOPLE WITH SPIKES, BLASTING

23:07.252 --> 23:09.221
THEM WITH MUSIC, AND LOCKING

23:09.287 --> 23:09.788
THEM UP -- DOESN'T SOLVE THE

23:09.855 --> 23:11.256
PROBLEM, WHAT DOES?

23:11.323 --> 23:12.190
WELL, THIS HOUSING ADVOCATE HAS

23:12.257 --> 23:14.659
A BOLD NEW IDEA.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.161
>> THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.395
THIS IS WHAT THE SOLUTION IS.

23:17.462 --> 23:18.330
THIS IS ONLY THING THAT ENDS

23:18.396 --> 23:19.331
HOMELESSNESS.

23:19.397 --> 23:20.165
IT'S THIS RIGHT HERE:

23:20.232 --> 23:21.166
HOUSE KEYS.

23:21.233 --> 23:21.867
>> John: EXACTLY.

23:21.933 --> 23:25.137
HOUSE KEYS.

23:25.203 --> 23:25.504
IN OTHER WORDS,

23:25.570 --> 23:26.204
GIVE THE HOMELESS HOMES.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.340
IT'S THE SOLUTION YOU'VE

23:28.406 --> 23:29.274
PROBABLY BEEN SHOUTING AT

23:29.341 --> 23:30.675
YOUR TV FOR THE PAST 15 MINUTES,

23:30.742 --> 23:31.610
OR LET'S BE HONEST,

23:31.676 --> 23:32.377
SHOUTING AT YOUR LAPTOP, OR, IF

23:32.444 --> 23:32.911
WE'RE BEING REALLY HONEST,

23:32.978 --> 23:33.712
SHOUTING AT YOUR PHONE DURING

23:33.779 --> 23:36.214
YOUR MONDAY MORNING SHIT.

23:36.281 --> 23:37.783
AND IF YOU ARE ANNOYED I WASTED

23:37.849 --> 23:38.950
YOUR TIME TAKING THE SCENIC

23:39.017 --> 23:40.285
ROUTE HERE, LET ME MAKE IT UP TO

23:40.352 --> 23:41.820
YOU WITH ANOTHER EXCELLENT CLIP

23:41.887 --> 23:42.754
FROM "THE TYRA BANKS SHOW."

23:42.821 --> 23:50.362
>> [SCREAMING]

23:50.428 --> 23:51.696
>> John: THERE IS SOME CONTEXT

23:51.763 --> 23:52.964
FOR THAT, BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT

23:53.031 --> 23:54.232
HONESTLY WOULDN'T MAKE IT MAKE

23:54.299 --> 23:57.736
ANY MORE SENSE.

23:57.803 --> 23:58.937
NOW SOME WILL SAY, SURE, GIVING

23:59.004 --> 24:00.405
THE HOMELESS HOMES IS AN OBVIOUS

24:00.472 --> 24:02.073
SOLUTION, BUT BEFORE THAT, THEY

24:02.140 --> 24:03.875
NEED TO BE SOBER AND HAVE A JOB.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.278
BUT IT'S JUST NOT THAT SIMPLE.

24:06.344 --> 24:08.980
SET ASIDE THAT DEALING WITH

24:09.047 --> 24:09.681
SOBRIETY OR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH

24:09.748 --> 24:13.118
ISSUES IS HARD ENOUGH WHEN

24:13.185 --> 24:13.785
YOU ARE NOT LIVING ON THE

24:13.852 --> 24:14.419
STREETS.

24:14.486 --> 24:15.520
GETTING A JOB IS OFTEN, IF

24:15.587 --> 24:16.822
NOT CONTINGENT ON, AT LEAST

24:16.888 --> 24:18.423
AIDED BY HAVING AN ADDRESS.

24:18.490 --> 24:19.991
THAT IS WHY ADVOCATES ENDORSE AN

24:20.058 --> 24:21.626
APPROACH CALLED "HOUSING FIRST."

24:21.693 --> 24:23.695
IT PRIORITIZES HELPING PEOPLE

24:23.762 --> 24:25.297
GET A PLACE TO LIVE, BUT ALSO

24:25.363 --> 24:26.331
OFFERS SUPPORT LIKE MENTAL

24:26.398 --> 24:28.333
HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.634
WE'VE ACTUALLY TRIED A VERSION

24:29.701 --> 24:31.203
OF THIS WITH HOMELESS VETERANS,

24:31.269 --> 24:33.738
AND IT HAD SOME REAL SUCCESS:

24:33.805 --> 24:35.040
>> THE FIRST STEP OF THIS NEW

24:35.106 --> 24:36.174
MODEL IS A PERMANENT HOUSE,

24:36.241 --> 24:37.642
FUNDED MOSTLY AT GOVERNMENT

24:37.709 --> 24:38.510
EXPENSE, WITH SERVICES THEN

24:38.577 --> 24:41.847
ADDED AROUND THE RESIDENT.

24:41.913 --> 24:42.480
IT'S CALLED PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

24:42.547 --> 24:43.648
HOUSING.

24:43.715 --> 24:44.349
AND THAT'S WHAT LENDELL SEAY

24:44.416 --> 24:46.151
FOUND HIMSELF IN.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.552
SEAY LIVES IN THIS COMPLEX THAT

24:47.619 --> 24:49.020
HOUSES ONLY FORMERLY HOMELESS

24:49.087 --> 24:49.788
VETERANS.

24:49.855 --> 24:52.891
WHILE THERE IS NO FIRM PROGRAM

24:52.958 --> 24:53.491
THAT HE HAS TO FOLLOW, HE HAS

24:53.558 --> 24:55.026
ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES,

24:55.093 --> 24:56.161
INCLUDING ON-SITE CASE MANAGERS,

24:56.228 --> 24:57.696
MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING,

24:57.762 --> 24:58.964
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT, AND

24:59.030 --> 25:01.099
EVEN A COMMUNITY GARDEN.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.101
>> IT FEEL GOOD.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.402
SOMETIMES, I WALK AROUND THE

25:04.469 --> 25:05.737
APARTMENT AND NO TV OR NOTHING

25:05.804 --> 25:07.973
ON AND JUST SINGING FOR NO

25:08.039 --> 25:09.407
REASON AT ALL.

25:09.474 --> 25:10.609
AND THEN I CATCH MYSELF DOING IT

25:10.675 --> 25:11.810
AND I START TO LAUGH, AND I SAY,

25:11.877 --> 25:14.379
"YOU MUST BE GOING CRAZY NOW."

25:14.446 --> 25:15.780
BUT I'M JUST HAPPY, IT FEEL --

25:15.847 --> 25:16.815
>> A GOOD CRAZY.

25:16.882 --> 25:21.152
>> IT FEEL GOOD.

25:21.219 --> 25:21.887
>> John: THAT IS A VERY NICE

25:21.953 --> 25:22.520
THING TO SEE.

25:22.587 --> 25:23.154
IT'S LIKE TWO BABIES HUGGING OR

25:23.221 --> 25:23.955
FOUR GRANDPARENTS ABSOLUTELY

25:24.022 --> 25:25.123
RAILING EACH OTHER.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.191
IT'S SOMETHING THAT JUST FILLS

25:26.258 --> 25:27.959
YOU WITH HOPE.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.461
AND THANKS TO THIS HOUSING FIRST

25:29.527 --> 25:30.795
STRATEGY, THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS

25:30.862 --> 25:32.831
VETERANS DROPPED FROM 74,000 IN

25:32.898 --> 25:35.367
2010 TO 38,000 IN 2018, A NEAR

25:35.433 --> 25:37.802
50% REDUCTION.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.004
AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS JUST

25:39.070 --> 25:39.971
ONE VERSION OF WHAT THIS CAN

25:40.038 --> 25:41.640
LOOK LIKE.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.108
FOR THOSE RECENTLY MADE

25:43.174 --> 25:45.277
HOMELESS, RAPID REHOUSING

25:45.343 --> 25:47.746
PROVIDES SHORT-TERM RENTAL

25:47.812 --> 25:48.513
ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO HELP

25:48.580 --> 25:49.180
PEOPLE GET BACK ON THEIR FEET

25:49.247 --> 25:50.515
QUICKLY.

25:50.582 --> 25:51.983
AND LOOK, HOUSING FIRST PROGRAMS

25:52.050 --> 25:53.518
CLEARLY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

25:53.585 --> 25:54.653
RESOURCES AND FUNDING, BUT IT IS

25:54.719 --> 25:55.987
NOT LIKE OUR CURRENT APPROACH IS

25:56.054 --> 25:58.223
CHEAP.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.925
ONE STUDY IN FLORIDA THAT

25:59.991 --> 26:01.826
TRACKED A DECADE'S WORTH OF

26:01.893 --> 26:03.228
SPENDING ON JUST 107 CHRONICALLY

26:03.295 --> 26:04.562
HOMELESS PEOPLE FOUND THAT,

26:04.629 --> 26:05.797
JUST BETWEEN MONEY SPENT ON

26:05.864 --> 26:07.265
INCARCERATION AND EMERGENCY

26:07.332 --> 26:08.566
MEDICAL TREATMENT, THEIR

26:08.633 --> 26:09.768
COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL

26:09.834 --> 26:11.469
GOVERNMENTS HAD SPENT AN AVERAGE

26:11.536 --> 26:13.471
OF JUST OVER $31,000 PER PERSON

26:13.538 --> 26:15.607
PER YEAR, WHEN THE ESTIMATED

26:15.674 --> 26:16.641
COST OF PROVIDING THEM WITH

26:16.708 --> 26:17.642
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

26:17.709 --> 26:18.877
WOULD'VE ONLY BEEN AROUND

26:18.944 --> 26:21.813
$10,000 PER YEAR.

26:21.880 --> 26:22.747
SO IF YOUR ARGUMENT AGAINST

26:22.814 --> 26:24.516
HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS WAS

26:24.582 --> 26:25.317
PURELY MONETARY,

26:25.383 --> 26:26.751
CONGRATULATIONS, YOUR CONCERNS

26:26.818 --> 26:28.286
HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.

26:28.353 --> 26:29.354
ALSO, A PRE-CONGRATULATIONS FOR

26:29.421 --> 26:30.455
BEING VISITED BY THREE GHOSTS

26:30.522 --> 26:33.692
THIS UPCOMING CHRISTMAS EVE.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.994
BUT FUNDING ISN'T THE ONLY ISSUE

26:36.061 --> 26:36.861
HERE.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.631
A HUGE OBSTACLE IN IMPLEMENTING

26:39.698 --> 26:40.532
THESE SORTS OF PROGRAMS IS

26:40.598 --> 26:43.935
OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS.

26:44.002 --> 26:44.936
IT IS THE "NIMBY" PROBLEM --

26:45.003 --> 26:45.537
"NOT IN MY BACK YARD" --

26:45.603 --> 26:48.773
AND IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.341
TAKE CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA,

26:49.407 --> 26:50.875
WHERE NEW DEVELOPMENTS OFFERING

26:50.942 --> 26:51.643
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, INCLUDING

26:51.710 --> 26:53.345
THOSE GEARED TO THE HOMELESS,

26:53.411 --> 26:54.946
WERE PROPOSED, ONLY TO ENCOUNTER

26:55.013 --> 26:56.982
FIERCE COMMUNITY PUSHBACK LIKE

26:57.048 --> 26:57.582
THIS:

26:57.649 --> 26:58.283
>> YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT IT IN

26:58.350 --> 26:59.484
OUR BACKYARD.

26:59.551 --> 27:00.452
>> IT'S NOT FAIR.

27:00.518 --> 27:01.353
>> WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS PAST

27:01.419 --> 27:02.387
CRAZY.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.521
>> WELL, IT'S JUST GOING TO GO

27:03.588 --> 27:04.889
DOWNHILL IF YOU BRING ALL THAT

27:04.956 --> 27:06.124
IN.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.025
ALL THAT RIFF-RAFF.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.293
I DON'T NEED IT.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.160
>> IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT

27:09.227 --> 27:10.395
PLACE.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.563
I AGREE THAT THEY NEED HELP.

27:11.629 --> 27:12.998
I AGREE THAT THEY NEED TO FIND A

27:13.064 --> 27:13.631
LOCATION.

27:13.698 --> 27:14.532
BUT CLAREMONT IS NOT THE

27:14.599 --> 27:15.667
LOCATION TO BE HAD.

27:15.734 --> 27:16.768
>> HOW IS THAT GOING TO IMPACT

27:16.835 --> 27:17.068
CRIME?

27:17.135 --> 27:17.869
HOW IS THAT GOING TO IMPACT THE

27:17.936 --> 27:20.138
BUSINESSES OUT HERE?

27:20.205 --> 27:21.539
IS THERE LOW-INCOME?

27:21.606 --> 27:23.141
ARE THEY GOING TO BE SPENDING

27:23.208 --> 27:24.075
MONEY AT THE SUSHI PLACE OR, YOU

27:24.142 --> 27:25.710
KNOW, OR NOT?

27:25.777 --> 27:26.878
>> John: OH, NO!

27:26.945 --> 27:28.847
NOT THE SUSHI PLACE!

27:28.913 --> 27:30.415
I DIDN'T REALIZE A PREREQUISITE

27:30.482 --> 27:31.449
FOR HOUSING WAS A WILLINGNESS TO

27:31.516 --> 27:32.183
SPEND FRIDAY NIGHTS

27:32.250 --> 27:34.919
DEEP THROATING NIGIRI.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.488
AS FOR THE GUY SAYING, "I AGREE

27:36.554 --> 27:38.923
THEY NEED TO FIND A LOCATION,

27:38.990 --> 27:42.994
JUST NOT HERE" -- WHERE THEN?

27:43.061 --> 27:44.129
BECAUSE YOU DO GET JUST BECAUSE

27:44.195 --> 27:44.662
SOMEONE LEAVES YOUR SIGHT

27:44.729 --> 27:45.630
DOESN'T MEAN THEY STOP EXISTING,

27:45.697 --> 27:46.731
RIGHT?

27:46.798 --> 27:47.732
IT'S A CONCEPT WE ALL LEARN

27:47.799 --> 27:48.967
PRETTY EARLY, AFTER ABOUT EIGHT

27:49.034 --> 27:49.834
MONTHS OF ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING

27:49.901 --> 27:51.936
GAMES OF PEEK-A-BOO.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.805
AND CLAREMONT'S BY NO MEANS AN

27:53.872 --> 27:54.939
ISOLATED EXAMPLE.

27:55.006 --> 27:55.974
IN NORTH TEXAS, LOCAL RESIDENTS

27:56.041 --> 27:57.776
MOBILIZED AGAINST A PROPOSED

27:57.842 --> 27:59.477
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT,

27:59.544 --> 28:00.645
WHICH HAD UNITS SET ASIDE FOR

28:00.712 --> 28:01.713
RESIDENTS USING "HOUSING

28:01.780 --> 28:02.514
CHOICE," OR "SECTION 8"

28:02.580 --> 28:04.049
VOUCHERS -- BASICALLY, RENTAL

28:04.115 --> 28:05.717
SUBSIDIES FOR LOW-INCOME OR

28:05.784 --> 28:07.819
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS.

28:07.886 --> 28:08.753
AND HERE'S HOW ONE OPPONENT OF

28:08.820 --> 28:11.256
THE PROJECT EXPLAINED HERSELF.

28:11.322 --> 28:12.991
>> THE LIFESTYLE I FEEL LIKE

28:13.058 --> 28:14.392
THAT IS -- GOES WITH SECTION 8

28:14.459 --> 28:17.529
IS USUALLY WORKING SINGLE --

28:17.595 --> 28:18.930
EITHER SINGLE MOMS OR PEOPLE WHO

28:18.997 --> 28:20.632
ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR

28:20.698 --> 28:21.833
HEADS ABOVE WATER.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.535
AND IT'S NOT -- I FEEL SO BAD

28:23.601 --> 28:26.604
SAYING THAT, BUT IT'S NOT --

28:26.671 --> 28:28.540
IT'S JUST NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE, I

28:28.606 --> 28:31.409
GUESS, OF THE SAME CLASS AS US,

28:31.476 --> 28:33.545
WHICH SOUNDS BAD, BUT I DON'T

28:33.611 --> 28:35.713
MEAN THAT IN A BAD WAY.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.015
>> YOU THINK THAT YOU MAYBE ARE

28:37.082 --> 28:38.850
STEREOTYPING THE FOLKS?

28:38.917 --> 28:40.518
>> OH, I TOTALLY AM, 100%!

28:40.585 --> 28:43.321
IT'S NOT -- IT WORKS BOTH WAYS.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.689
I -- I'M DEFINITELY NOT A RACIST

28:44.756 --> 28:45.657
AND I'M NOT BIGOT, BUT, UM,

28:45.723 --> 28:47.525
I -- I THINK I HOLD A LITTLE BIT

28:47.592 --> 28:50.662
OF A STIGMA AGAINST PEOPLE WHO

28:50.728 --> 28:51.729
ARE DIFFERENT.

28:51.796 --> 28:53.765
>> John: OKAY, SOME QUICK

28:53.832 --> 28:55.100
CORRECTIONS THERE:

28:55.166 --> 28:55.700
YOU DON'T FEEL THAT BAD SAYING

28:55.767 --> 28:56.868
IT.

28:56.935 --> 28:57.969
THE THINGS YOU'RE SAYING ARE

28:58.036 --> 29:00.505
THINGS RACISTS AND BIGOTS SAY.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.606
AND SAYING "I'M NOT A RACIST OR

29:01.673 --> 29:02.540
A BIGOT" BUT ALSO SAYING YOU

29:02.607 --> 29:03.808
HAVE "A STIGMA AGAINST PEOPLE

29:03.875 --> 29:04.809
WHO ARE DIFFERENT" ISN'T

29:04.876 --> 29:06.177
NECESSARILY SPLITTING HAIRS, BUT

29:06.244 --> 29:07.412
IT'S DEFINITELY SEGREGATING

29:07.479 --> 29:09.380
THEM.

29:09.447 --> 29:11.816
AND WHILE THAT WOMAN LIVES IN A

29:11.883 --> 29:12.917
CONSERVATIVE AREA OF TEXAS,

29:12.984 --> 29:13.718
PLENTY OF THE PLACES YOU'VE SEEN

29:13.785 --> 29:14.819
TONIGHT -- AND PLENTY OF THE

29:14.886 --> 29:16.121
PLACES WHERE THESE SENTIMENTS

29:16.187 --> 29:17.355
RUN DEEPEST -- ARE DEEP-BLUE

29:17.422 --> 29:19.324
LIBERAL CITIES.

29:19.390 --> 29:20.525
THE TRUTH IS, SOME OF YOU

29:20.592 --> 29:21.459
WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW MAY

29:21.526 --> 29:23.261
SHARE SOME OF THOSE VIEWS.

29:23.328 --> 29:25.263
AND IF YOU DO, I IMPLORE YOU TO

29:25.330 --> 29:26.965
TAKE IN EVERY WORD OF THIS

29:27.031 --> 29:28.867
FORMERLY UNHOUSED MOTHER,

29:28.933 --> 29:29.968
KEANAKAY SCOTT, WHO WROTE A

29:30.034 --> 29:31.302
LETTER TO THE NIMBYs IN HER

29:31.369 --> 29:32.971
HOMETOWN.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.472
>> YOU WEAR YOUR BIAS LIKE A

29:34.539 --> 29:35.440
BADGE OF HONOR WHEN YOU SEE MY

29:35.507 --> 29:36.608
HISTORY.

29:36.674 --> 29:37.375
YOU JUDGE ME FOR HAVING

29:37.442 --> 29:38.376
CHILDREN, FOR NEEDING

29:38.443 --> 29:39.244
ASSISTANCE.

29:39.310 --> 29:40.278
YOU HATE ME FOR WANTING THE

29:40.345 --> 29:41.546
STABILITY YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.113
AND WHY?

29:42.180 --> 29:43.548
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LIKE LOOKING

29:43.615 --> 29:44.582
THE OTHER WAY WHEN YOU SAW ME ON

29:44.649 --> 29:47.051
THE STREET?

29:47.118 --> 29:48.219
OR IS IT SIMPLY BECAUSE I MAKE

29:48.286 --> 29:48.786
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, AND YOUR

29:48.853 --> 29:49.420
DISCOMFORT IS ENOUGH TO

29:49.487 --> 29:50.321
DISQUALIFY A PERSON FROM THE

29:50.388 --> 29:52.056
AMERICAN DREAM?

29:52.123 --> 29:53.124
>> John: EXACTLY.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.126
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

29:55.193 --> 29:55.994
IT IS NOT THE HOUSED'S COMFORT

29:56.060 --> 29:57.495
THAT NEEDS TO BE PRIORITIZED

29:57.562 --> 29:58.930
RIGHT NOW.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.198
SO IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY

30:00.265 --> 30:05.703
HOMELESSNESS CONTINUES TO GET

30:05.770 --> 30:06.504
WORSE IN THIS COUNTRY, ONE

30:06.571 --> 30:07.005
REASON IS THAT THERE

30:07.071 --> 30:07.872
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE -- EVEN

30:07.939 --> 30:08.773
LIBERALS -- WHO BELIEVE THAT

30:08.840 --> 30:09.574
HOMELESSNESS IS A PERSONAL

30:09.641 --> 30:10.508
FAILING, POVERTY CAN BE AVOIDED,

30:10.575 --> 30:11.442
AND THEIR OWN GOOD FORTUNE MAKES

30:11.509 --> 30:12.377
THEM NOT ONLY BETTER THAN THE

30:12.443 --> 30:12.944
UNHOUSED BUT MORE WORTHY OF

30:13.011 --> 30:14.812
COMFORT.

30:14.879 --> 30:16.080
IT IS BASICALLY REAGAN'S

30:16.147 --> 30:17.282
ATTITUDE FROM A WHOLE FOODS

30:17.348 --> 30:19.083
CROWD.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.151
AND I DON'T WANT TO OVERSIMPLIFY

30:20.218 --> 30:21.886
THE LOGISTICS INVOLVED HERE.

30:21.953 --> 30:23.054
IT WILL TAKE A MASSIVE

30:23.121 --> 30:25.290
COMMITMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE,

30:25.356 --> 30:27.158
FUNDING, AND RESOURCES.

30:27.225 --> 30:27.892
BUT THE VERY FIRST STEP HERE IS

30:27.959 --> 30:29.027
A COLLECTIVE CHANGE OF

30:29.093 --> 30:31.629
PERCEPTIONS.

30:31.696 --> 30:32.630
BASICALLY, WE NEED TO STOP BEING

30:32.697 --> 30:33.565
DICKS AND ASSUMING THAT THE

30:33.631 --> 30:34.199
UNHOUSED ARE A COLLECTION OF

30:34.265 --> 30:35.466
DRUG ADDICT CRIMINALS WHO'VE

30:35.533 --> 30:36.834
CHOSEN THIS LIFE FOR THEMSELVES,

30:36.901 --> 30:38.870
INSTEAD OF PEOPLE SUFFERING THE

30:38.937 --> 30:40.772
INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF

30:40.838 --> 30:42.073
GUTTED SOCIAL PROGRAMS AND A

30:42.140 --> 30:43.241
NATIONWIDE DIVESTMENT FROM

30:43.308 --> 30:46.678
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

30:46.744 --> 30:47.545
I REALLY HOPE THAT IS ONE OF THE

30:47.612 --> 30:48.446
TWO KEY THINGS THAT STICKS IN

30:48.513 --> 30:49.247
YOUR HEAD FROM TONIGHT'S SHOW --

30:49.314 --> 30:50.415
