Anus, are you still up?

00:08.509 --> 00:09.801
ANUS: Yeah. Come on in, sis.

00:09.885 --> 00:13.138
Have you ever had to tell a lie
in order to keep a friend?

00:13.222 --> 00:17.809
ANUS: Well, the other day I told Jane her
blouse was pretty when it was really PU.

00:17.893 --> 00:18.894
[Audience laughing]

00:19.019 --> 00:21.730
SHERRY: Anus, I'm serious!
ANUS: Look, sis.

00:21.813 --> 00:25.359
ANUS: Sometimes it's better to tell a fib
than to hurt someone's feelings.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.277
You're the best!

[Cheerful music playing]

00:40.123 --> 00:41.375
Oh, that was good.

00:41.458 --> 00:45.420
That was even funnier than the one where
Anus got the hamster stuck in his mouth.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.882
LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

00:48.966 --> 00:52.010

The old alma mater.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.876
I tell you,
there's something magical about Brown.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.086
Brown's the color of poo!

01:26.211 --> 01:27.546
[Laughing]

01:28.297 --> 01:29.923
Yes. Yes, it is.

I haven't been
on a college campus in years.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.637
LOIS: Everything seems so different.
STEWIE: Really?

01:35.721 --> 01:40.225
If you laid on your back with your ankles
behind your ears, it would ring a bell.

PETER:
Excuse me. We're here to see the dean.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.149
Nobody sees the dean! Not nobody!
Not no how!

01:47.232 --> 01:48.692
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.527
Yes. This is Meg Griffin.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.863
She's here to see the Dean of Admissions.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.491
And we'd like it
if she got into the university.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.995
Go on, take it.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.122
Wait over there.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.791
My days in college were so exciting.

02:05.167 --> 02:09.171
This one time the National Guard came
and shot some of my friends.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.841
You must be the Griffins. Come in.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.761
Oops, honey! You got a little smudge.

on your other cheek, too.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.686
And this is Pembroke Quad.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.439
Oh, very nice. Very Brideshead Revisited.

What ho! A veritable bevy of coeds.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.459
I say, the most recent
campus sporting event...

02:47.543 --> 02:49.753
...was disappointing for our side,
wasn't it?

02:49.837 --> 02:54.049
Oh, aren't you adorable!
Are you in a fraternity, little boy?

02:54.132 --> 02:57.886

03:00.472 --> 03:03.642
So, what do you think
of this Music Television?

03:05.477 --> 03:08.355
If I remember correctly,
this is the Physics Department.

That explains all the gravity.

Why don't you come back
in about 17 years?

sodium pentothal is only two years and--

This isn't the first time
I've been thwarted by my small stature.

Okay. Our next lot is number 15
in your program.

A super mega-death ray.

Well, then let's take a look
at your transcript.

04:32.606 --> 04:36.443
"Meg." That's not very impressive.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.780
I mean, it's just three letters.
It's hardly a name at all.

04:39.863 --> 04:43.033
I never wanted to call her Meg.
I wanted to call her Twiki.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.786
But Lois said kids these days
wouldn't get the reference.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.121
You know who I'm talking about, right?

04:48.747 --> 04:50.958
I'm not quite sure you're Brown material.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.919
Don't you have any
extracurricular activities at all?

04:54.211 --> 04:57.589
I'm president of the Luke Perry Fan Club,
Quahog Chapter.

04:58.340 --> 05:02.052
But I've wanted to go to Brown
ever since I was a little girl.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.805
Well, actually,
I really wanted to go to Wellesley.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.014
But my mom said...

05:06.098 --> 05:09.601
...I might as well buy hiking boots
and call myself a lesbian right now.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.270

more extracurricular activities.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.803
You could get a part-time job.

at your school.

I don't know, Meg.

But someday our two worlds will be one.

If I were big,
just think where I would be.

Tired of not being able to find clothes
that fit? I know I was.

But here. I brought you a copy.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.788
Oh, my God! "Corruption in City Hall."
This is amazing.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.748
Here. Let me see that.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.626
This'll never get Meg on the paper.
This is old news.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.963
There have been scandals in politics
ever since Thomas Jefferson.

11:54.590 --> 11:58.177
Hold on.
Honey, let's get all the kids in this.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.057
Look, I know kids.
And this story's gonna put them to sleep.

12:04.141 --> 12:07.352
Meg needs something that's gonna pull
those kids away from...

12:07.436 --> 12:14.234
...their Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots,
Spirographs, Moby Grape, and 90210.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.448
Luke Perry. That's it!

12:19.656 --> 12:21.158
Brian, I got my story.

[Rousing instrumental music]

12:29.041 --> 12:32.211
Now to get this story
on the school editor's desk.

12:32.377 --> 12:37.591
It's gonna take a portion of
my cunning.... No! No! All my cunning.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.973
Great story, Meg.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.432
Oh, thanks.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.059
Way to go, Meg!

13:30.143 --> 13:31.144
[Applause]

13:32.145 --> 13:33.564
Congratulations, Meg.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.441
This is the most sensational story
we've ever had.

LUKE: In a minute, babe.

13:47.494 --> 13:51.540
I'm reading every high school newspaper
in America to see if I'm mentioned.

13:53.959 --> 13:58.714

Meg Griffin, you are so sued.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.475
Luke Perry is suing us?

14:10.559 --> 14:13.729
Dad, how could you do this to me?
I love Luke Perry!

14:13.812 --> 14:17.357
Jeez, Meg! You're wasting your time.
Don't you read the papers? He's gay.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.359
BRIAN: You can't
just print lies about people.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.403
-Luke Perry has a wife and son.
-So what?

14:21.486 --> 14:25.073
A lot of famous types lead secret lives
that we don't even know about.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.283
Like Ricky Martin.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.369

I just wanted you to have something
to put on your transcript.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.764
Thanks to you I can put down...

14:48.847 --> 14:51.558
...I'm a big fat liar
who makes up stories about people.

14:51.642 --> 14:53.227
It worked for Walter Cronkite.

You know that whole Vietnam thing?
Never happened.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.357
BRIAN: But don't mention it
around the Veterans' Hospital.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.484
Those guys are really
committed to the lie.

Don't cry, sweetheart.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.988
I'll make it up to you.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.533
You remember that pony
you wanted when you were six?

15:07.616 --> 15:08.784
Well, I bought him.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.912
And I've been saving him
for a time like this. Surprise!

15:13.705 --> 15:18.085
Oh, God. That's right.
Ponies like food, don't they?

15:18.585 --> 15:19.670
Oh, boy.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.882
Poor Meg. I know it sounds crazy.

15:23.966 --> 15:27.219
But I can't help feeling
like this is somehow my fault.

15:27.302 --> 15:28.846
No. It's Luke Perry's fault.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.181
If he were actually gay,
Meg would be all set.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.683
Brian, that's it!

15:32.766 --> 15:36.103
If I could get a picture of Luke Perry
doing something gay-like...

15:36.186 --> 15:38.939
...it'll make people believe
Meg's story is true!

15:40.023 --> 15:41.441
How are you gonna do that?

so Luke Perry doesn't recognize us.

He was doing it for you.

He knows how much
you want to go to Brown.
