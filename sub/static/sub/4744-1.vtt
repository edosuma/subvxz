02:30.984 --> 02:32.815
They don't look very happy.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.722
Why should they? They just got married.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.667
- I hope you enjoy your trip, Mr. Wallace.
- Thank you.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.204
- And your wife of course.
- Thanks a lot.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.966
I suppose I've got Maurice
to thank for this.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.211
What are you doing?

02:59.779 --> 03:02.771
Just trying to discover
where the strings are attached.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.374
"Hope you have a nice trip, Mr. Wallace."

03:05.885 --> 03:07.113
And my wife.

03:08.821 --> 03:12.279
You're too suspicious about Maurice.
What harm did he ever do us?

03:12.358 --> 03:13.620
He hounds us.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.886
He hounds us? Nonsense.

03:16.229 --> 03:19.528
Mr. Maurice Dalbret for you, Mr. Wallace,
from Saint-Tropez.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.390
He hounds us.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.968
I told you.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.908
Of course we could have flown direct.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.377
But we wanted to have
a few days on our own.

03:34.447 --> 03:36.244
- <i>Can I help you?</i>
- London, please.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.577
Joanna and me.

03:38.484 --> 03:39.974
My wife.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.388
It's too late to change.
Anyway, I want the car down there.

03:45.491 --> 03:48.551
Yes, my darling. Of course I will.

03:49.662 --> 03:52.859
- Of course I won't.
- Nothing is gonna fall down.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.897
- We have to fly.
- And you'll take care of Granny.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.864
And Nanny, too. Take care of everyone.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.301
But that makes nonsense
of the whole spatial concept.

04:06.012 --> 04:09.072
Spatial concept.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.315
It messes up the whole lousy design.

04:13.152 --> 04:14.983
I'll see you in three days.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.487
Who is it now?

04:23.196 --> 04:25.528
Caroline Wallace. Your daughter.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.165
Oh, Caroline.

04:29.669 --> 04:32.502
Hello, how's my little girl?

04:35.375 --> 04:36.501
Cigarettes?

04:47.253 --> 04:48.948
You bring your passport?

04:55.662 --> 04:57.254
Look, I'm sorry, but I...

04:57.330 --> 05:00.424
We'll have to turn back.
I've left my passport.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.194
I'm sorry, sir. Are you sure?

05:02.268 --> 05:04.896
Yes, I've got to go
to a most important conference...

05:05.038 --> 05:07.973
Mark Wallace, 33 years old.
Occupation: Architect.

05:13.546 --> 05:16.106
Now how about
getting me some cigarettes?

05:27.126 --> 05:28.286
Thank you.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.190
- It's just that Maurice...
- Managed to persuade you...

05:31.264 --> 05:34.392
that we have to get to Saint-Tropez
by the day before yesterday.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.458
Why do you always get taken in?

05:36.769 --> 05:38.862
Baby, that's how it is, okay?

05:43.609 --> 05:46.339
You want me not to work?
Is that what you want?

05:49.949 --> 05:52.440
Just wish that you'd stop sniping.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.011
I haven't said a word.

05:55.154 --> 05:58.920
Just because you use a silencer
doesn't mean you're not a sniper.

06:01.961 --> 06:05.124
We're not going on like this
for the rest of our lives.

06:32.024 --> 06:35.152
<i>You haven't been happy</i>
<i>since the day we met</i>, <i>have you?</i>

06:36.596 --> 06:40.088
<i>If only you were 10 years younger</i>
<i>and you knew what you know now.</i>

06:40.166 --> 06:41.929
You can say that again.

07:19.338 --> 07:22.330
I wonder if anybody's picked up
the wrong passport.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.805
Excuse me, do you mind,
I'm looking for a passport.

07:26.879 --> 07:29.712
- I look in your bag, sir?
- It's not in my bag.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.341
- Somebody must have taken it.
- I doubt that, sir.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.388
You know what a British passport's
worth on the black market in Naples?

07:36.489 --> 07:37.513
L100 at least.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.683
- This is France.
- I've not got the latest figures for France.

07:40.793 --> 07:45.230
I can see myself stuck on this boat for life,
going backwards and forwards.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.323
Hey, would it be your doing?

07:47.400 --> 07:50.665
That's nice. You leave something
for two seconds and...

07:54.874 --> 07:56.705
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

08:14.060 --> 08:18.019
<i>There was a time when you were glad</i>
<i>to be married to me. Early on.</i>

08:18.831 --> 08:23.632
<i>Remember the first trip we made when</i>
<i>we had wheels of our own</i>, <i>the old MG?</i>

08:23.736 --> 08:26.500
<i>Which birthday of mine was it</i>
<i>you gave yourself that?</i>

08:26.606 --> 08:28.301
<i>Was it our anniversary?</i>

08:28.574 --> 08:32.066
<i>Anyway</i>, <i>we were just going to</i>
<i>drive and drive and see where we got to.</i>

08:32.211 --> 08:34.941
<i>A couple of kids</i>
<i>with not a care in the world.</i>

08:37.350 --> 08:40.046
Hold your breath,
we've got a long way to go.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.749
What we need is a small push.

09:30.703 --> 09:31.727
Come on.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.734
Let's go.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.267
That's it. Very good.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.270
Faster.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.241
Come on.

09:44.617 --> 09:45.641
Faster.

09:58.464 --> 10:00.091
Remember me? Joanna?

10:00.666 --> 10:03.294
- What's the matter?
- Hear that? It's a donk.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.802
A donk? What kind of a donk?

10:06.939 --> 10:09.464
A medium-sized, slightly unhealthy donk.

10:15.147 --> 10:18.708
<i>When did it all start to go wrong?</i>
<i>Was it in the MG?</i>

10:19.218 --> 10:20.981
<i>Our first bust-up.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:23.551
<i>I thought we were quite happy in the MG.</i>

10:26.192 --> 10:28.786
It's what I call real independence,
don't you?

10:28.861 --> 10:31.796
I can still hear that damn donk. Hear it?

10:32.331 --> 10:33.355
Donk.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.295
It's in the engine.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.061
Right.

10:53.252 --> 10:57.245
This is the first afternoon
I've spent in natural light in over a year.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.115
The time I get home from work
it's pitch black.

11:00.192 --> 11:02.353
Originally you said you liked basements.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.452
Originally I liked basements.

11:04.530 --> 11:07.624
I think we were damn lucky
to get the place, frankly.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.827
I think we'll be damn lucky
to get out of it, frankly.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.669
If you want to live
in one half of a suburban shoebox...

11:15.808 --> 11:18.072
like your parents,
you married the wrong man.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.340
I don't want to live
in one half of a suburban shoebox.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.316
And I married the wrong man.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.814
Do you want a divorce?

11:32.758 --> 11:36.387
Why do we keep on with this farce?
Is it bloody worth it?

11:36.729 --> 11:38.094
No, it isn't.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.595
- It was your idea, you wanted it.
- And I got it.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.906
Yes, it is worth it sometimes.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.543
Only not now.

11:51.944 --> 11:54.913
I don't know what you ever saw in me
in the first place.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.708
I can't really remember.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.482
You had hair in those days, of course.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.753
<i>I don't think we had any kind of real</i>,
<i>you know</i>, <i>in the MG...</i>

12:08.027 --> 12:09.187
<i>bust-up.</i>

12:11.530 --> 12:15.899
Look, if you really want big houses,
fast cars, hot and cold running, servants...

12:16.001 --> 12:17.195
Who wants that?

12:17.269 --> 12:19.999
I know what you want.
You want big houses, fast cars.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.199
You're right. There is a donk.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.576
There is? I thought there was.

12:24.643 --> 12:28.272
Right there. There's something loose
without a question.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.371
If there is, you loosened it.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.751
Try and keep out of the lower gears.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.810
You try keeping out of the lower gears.

12:35.921 --> 12:36.979
Go on.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.417
You're mad, you know that?

12:40.626 --> 12:41.991
Let me get that.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.290
See, no donk if you're careful.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.334
Oh, shut up.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.952
I hate this.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.351
I can't see a...

13:12.858 --> 13:14.883
I got oil in my eye now.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.861
I could quit happily.

13:18.430 --> 13:21.524
- How is it down there?
- Pitch black!

13:22.968 --> 13:25.528
This exhaust pipe is so rusty I could...

13:26.972 --> 13:28.564
If I could just see.

13:28.674 --> 13:31.268
Difficult doing things in the dark, isn't it?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.469
We cannot afford a new flat.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.575
On our present budget,
we can't even afford a new exhaust pipe.

13:38.284 --> 13:41.651
You really ought to try
avoiding the lower gears, you know.

13:42.188 --> 13:45.282
Why don't you put a very British sock in it.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.951
Why don't you put a hard-boiled egg in it.

13:55.701 --> 13:58.329
- That fixed it.
- You mean that's fixed it?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.570
Or that's fixed it?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.071
Ask me in an hour's time.

14:03.409 --> 14:06.344
<i>You shouldn't have bought an MG</i>,
<i>you should've bought a tractor.</i>

14:06.445 --> 14:09.812
<i>I'll never forget you sitting</i>
<i>in that chauffeur-driven tractor.</i>

14:09.915 --> 14:13.078
<i>I'd never spoken to you</i>
<i>and I thought you looked insufferable.</i>

14:13.152 --> 14:17.418
<i>The girls were patty about you</i>
<i>and so</i>, <i>Heaven knows</i>, <i>were you.</i>

14:25.364 --> 14:27.958
Oh, man, what are we going to do?

14:28.033 --> 14:30.092
We'll never get there in time.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.968
Hey, look there.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.616
You're improving, Pat.

15:26.825 --> 15:29.157
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.022
Oh, everything.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.554
I don't think travel agrees with me.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.067
- I hope it isn't measles.
- I've had measles, clever.

15:38.537 --> 15:40.334
It must be something else.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.509
Oh, no.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.243
Chickenpox. No question.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.781
That's messed everything up completely.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.547
Messed what up?
I mean, what do you want exactly?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.953
We're supposed to be
going on holiday together.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.458
Then onto the music festival at Menton.
Middle of the month.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.651
What we do now, I don't know.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.329
Golly, nor do I.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.734
And then there were four.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.301
Only one thing to do, I suppose.

16:19.878 --> 16:22.108
Let's see who's left in the morning.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.573
Good plan.

16:37.363 --> 16:40.890
- How are you this morning?
- I'm very well.

16:40.966 --> 16:43.434
- How are you?
- Very well, indeed.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.863
And the others?

16:48.140 --> 16:50.973
I'm afraid it's been a night
full of casualties.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.436
I am sorry.

16:56.415 --> 16:59.816
I think we should leave them the Minibus
and press on.

17:00.085 --> 17:03.179
- Does that appeal to you?
- How can you be so callous?

17:06.392 --> 17:08.053
When do we leave?

17:08.359 --> 17:09.952
Whenever you're ready.

17:10.796 --> 17:13.424
- I thought you went to the doctor's.
- I drove the others.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.864
- Nothing wrong with me.
- You positive?

17:16.568 --> 17:18.866
- That feeling can be very deceptive.
- Right.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.439
I've had chickenpox, when I was 12.

17:21.773 --> 17:25.505
We're not taking the bus. We'll leave it
for the others when they're better.

17:25.611 --> 17:28.478
- We thought we'd hitchhike.
- I love hitchhiking.

17:29.181 --> 17:32.514
- I won't be in the way, will I?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

17:32.618 --> 17:35.587
Where do you think
we'll get to by tonight? There?

17:39.324 --> 17:42.122
- There.
- We can do better than that, can't we?

17:42.194 --> 17:43.422
Can we?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.947
- Lambs.
- I guessed.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.750
Well, aren't they sweet?

18:16.161 --> 18:18.994
- It's a shame about Jackie, isn't it?
- Isn't it?

18:19.264 --> 18:22.597
I suppose you'd have preferred
if I'd got the chickenpox.

18:25.637 --> 18:30.006
- You don't have to stay with me.
- Listen, sweetheart, let's get this straight.

18:30.075 --> 18:33.044
I have absolutely no intention
of staying with you.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.408
I don't know what your plans are,
but I have a schedule.

18:37.182 --> 18:39.514
I am not, whatever you may be,
on holiday.

18:39.585 --> 18:42.247
- I understand.
- I'm here strictly for the buildings.

18:42.354 --> 18:46.085
Anything else is entirely by the way.
I haven't a minute to waste.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.320
- My time is organized.
- You're on a schedule.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.529
It's quite a tight schedule.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.924
Did you remember to pick up
your passport this morning?

19:26.765 --> 19:30.531
If there's one thing I really despise,
it's an indispensable woman.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.478
Nobody knows the names
of the men who made it.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.649
To make something as exquisite as this...

19:51.757 --> 19:55.056
without wanting to smash
your stupid name all over it...

19:55.127 --> 19:56.594
Would you want to?

19:57.563 --> 20:00.555
All you hear about nowadays
is people making names...

20:01.066 --> 20:02.226
not things.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.768
Sorry, do you want me
to take your picture?

20:12.878 --> 20:16.143
- No.
- This is really a three-dimensional camera.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.684
It's meant for photographing
three-dimensional subjects.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.510
I'm three-dimensional, as a matter of fact.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.689
It's basically for buildings.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.186
Well, I'm not a building.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.208
We won't have to waste a minute
stopping for lunch.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.340
The trouble with women is
they try to label you...

20:46.411 --> 20:48.106
put you in a pigeonhole.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.382
What they don't realize is...

20:52.851 --> 20:56.014
the only thing that fits in a pigeonhole
is a pigeon.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.080
Marriage is all they ever think about.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.989
I don't intend to get married
for at least 40 years.

21:08.233 --> 21:12.067
It's not that I have anything against sex.
It's contracts I don't go for.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.173
Promise of long service and good conduct.
Are you a virgin?

21:15.540 --> 21:17.770
Thought you were. Could always tell.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.340
Congratulations.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.278
I was two years
at the University of Chicago.

21:22.381 --> 21:24.372
Studying virgin detection?

21:25.517 --> 21:28.418
Only at night school.
Architecture during the day.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.279
I always thought American women
would be different.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.881
I thought they'd broken
the inhibitions barrier...

21:33.959 --> 21:35.790
and it was all one long sex feast.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.089
- No?
- But no.

21:38.263 --> 21:40.959
The nicely brought-up American girl
plays cool and modern...

21:41.066 --> 21:44.035
but what she wants
is what her grandmother wanted:

21:45.337 --> 21:48.431
Your head stuffed and mounted
on the living room wall.

21:50.742 --> 21:54.906
And if you don't want it that way,
you can take your loving self elsewhere...

21:55.080 --> 21:57.014
speaking quite generally, of course.

21:57.115 --> 21:59.583
Of course. Who was she?

22:01.853 --> 22:03.252
What do you mean?

22:04.389 --> 22:07.222
Her name was Cathy Seligman,
if you must know.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.858
She was selfish, grasping, philistine...

22:11.096 --> 22:15.089
materialistic, stubborn, opinionated.
I was crazy about her.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.458
Lucky for you, you'll never meet her.

22:17.569 --> 22:20.629
She's now
Mrs. Howard Maxwell Manchester.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.572
I always knew you two had to meet.

22:24.776 --> 22:28.644
"There's only one drawback," Howard said.
"We'll have to go to Greece."

22:29.781 --> 22:31.681
- Remember saying that?
- Yes.

22:31.783 --> 22:35.241
Drawback! Of course, I absolutely flipped!

22:36.588 --> 22:37.850
Howie, come on.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.953
The first thing we thought of...

22:40.025 --> 22:43.256
landing in Jolly Old
was getting in touch with you.

22:43.362 --> 22:47.321
I never thought that you newlyweds
would want to travel with us ancients.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.992
We don't care who we travel with, frankly.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.534
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, tell me something.

22:53.672 --> 22:56.004
Mommy, do snakes have nipples?

22:56.408 --> 22:58.808
No, they don't, Ruthie. Do they, Howie?

23:00.045 --> 23:01.603
No, they don't.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.908
Ruthie is hooked on nature.

23:04.983 --> 23:07.850
It's wonderful you two kids
were free to come with us.

23:07.953 --> 23:11.912
I just know that we're all going to be
terribly terrific friends.

23:12.657 --> 23:16.320
You know that Mark
used to be my favorite beau.

23:16.428 --> 23:17.793
Second favorite.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.594
Favorite favorite.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.797
That was before you came
on the scenario, Howard.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.531
Of course.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.806
Why don't they?

23:29.508 --> 23:31.135
Why don't who what?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.207
Snakes have nipples?

23:35.647 --> 23:37.547
Because they lay eggs.

23:39.484 --> 23:42.214
Did you remember to pack
the anti-snake serum?

23:43.088 --> 23:44.248
Good.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.324
Mark, do you remember David Lewinsohn?

23:47.559 --> 23:50.153
- No? David?
- It's Woody Lewinsohn.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.660
He's become a very fine physician
in New York City.

23:53.732 --> 23:54.756
I remember.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.993
He taught Howard
how to treat snake bites.

23:57.068 --> 24:00.265
How to inject the serum subcutaneously
and all that.

24:00.539 --> 24:03.633
- We've invested over $50...
- $60.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.739
$60 in anti-snake equipment.

24:07.045 --> 24:10.037
Well, I sure hope
somebody gets bitten by a snake.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.917
That's my 100 exactly. Now, let me see.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.725
Mark, it's you to drive.

24:22.060 --> 24:25.029
So we change places
and that's all there is to it.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.738
I'm hungry.

24:43.048 --> 24:46.040
I think Howard's wonderful
the way he organizes everything.

24:46.117 --> 24:49.484
He's not an efficiency consultant
for nothing, are you, sweetness?

24:49.588 --> 24:52.455
If he were
he wouldn't be married to you, honey.

24:52.791 --> 24:56.386
- I'm hungry.
- Hand me that guidebook, sugar.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.859
- Thanks.
- I want to eat something now.

25:00.932 --> 25:04.527
If you want to ruin your lunch,
Ruthiebelle, you can.

25:05.904 --> 25:09.704
We believe in leaving things
to Ruthie's own free decision.

25:10.275 --> 25:12.243
Does that key make the car go?

25:14.279 --> 25:15.541
Sort of.

25:17.382 --> 25:19.282
Ruthie, that hurt Mommy.

25:19.384 --> 25:21.716
Did you see what she did?
She pinched me.

25:21.786 --> 25:25.119
Yes, she probably thinks
you're excluding her, honeybunch.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.818
She needs reassuring.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.756
If she does it again,
I'll need hospitalization.

25:29.961 --> 25:31.724
Yes, well, we're covered.

25:35.066 --> 25:37.091
Have you ever been in analysis?

25:37.335 --> 25:38.393
No.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.134
It can be very worthwhile.

25:42.974 --> 25:44.942
Should I tell you a story, Ruthie?

25:46.011 --> 25:48.809
- Joanna, thank you.
- There we are, love.

25:50.015 --> 25:51.676
Come on, Ruthie.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.816
Well, well, well.
Quite like old times, Mr. Wallace.

26:06.097 --> 26:09.157
I see what you mean about
rearranging the luggage, Marcus.

26:09.267 --> 26:12.395
- Thought you might, Howie.
- Wow! That's a real sun.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.972
We're getting way down south, honey.

26:15.106 --> 26:18.940
Mommy, I'm hungry.
I want to eat something now.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.412
I don't want anything to eat.

26:24.182 --> 26:27.174
I think she's going to be
a little late fixating.

26:28.954 --> 26:31.821
She felt we hurried her.
Why don't we all relax?

26:31.890 --> 26:35.155
Marcus, I've been meaning
to say about expenses...

26:35.226 --> 26:37.717
I think I've come up with a formula.

26:41.499 --> 26:44.730
If you're agreeable, we'll call Ruthie a half.

26:45.236 --> 26:49.673
In which event, we can most efficaciously
divide everything into nine parts...

26:50.175 --> 26:53.633
and split them in the ratio of five to four.

26:54.579 --> 26:59.039
Yes, I think that's the final breakdown
on this morning's expenses.

26:59.184 --> 27:02.153
- Mark, if you care to check it.
- I believe you.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.981
Well, shall we go?

27:06.858 --> 27:08.985
You don't like my house, do you?

27:09.060 --> 27:12.393
Very handsome. Split-level.
Market at L25,000. I like it a lot.

27:12.497 --> 27:15.489
It's beautiful, Ruthie.
Come on, sweetheart.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.695
- I want to take my house with me.
- She's feeling insecure, only natural.

27:19.838 --> 27:23.001
- Come on, sweetness.
- I'd like to take my house with me.

27:26.444 --> 27:27.843
I want it!

27:28.446 --> 27:32.780
Ruthie, this time I have to say no.
And I mean, no. Now, no.

27:38.723 --> 27:43.422
It's very reassuring at times
to retain a certain flexibility of attitude.

27:44.729 --> 27:48.756
Howard has a tremendously mature
quality. That's what I love about him.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.025
He has quiet assurance.

27:52.837 --> 27:56.773
- Don't you think he has quiet assurance?
- Very quiet assurance.

27:56.908 --> 27:58.808
He's the husband type.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.278
You were always the lover type.
I guess you still are.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.213
I've been married to Joanna
for nearly two years.

28:05.283 --> 28:09.083
But your relationship is basically volatile.
Anyone can see that.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.790
Joanna, I don't want you to feel badly
about what happened just now.

28:12.891 --> 28:16.224
- It doesn't really matter.
- I think it does matter, Joanna.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.758
You resent Ruthie, don't you?

28:18.863 --> 28:21.457
- A little spilt wine.
- You misunderstand me.

28:21.566 --> 28:25.730
You resent her because she represents
the child you want to have.

28:30.341 --> 28:33.401
All right,
we are 17 minutes behind schedule.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.579
Marcus, you have 53 kilometers still to go.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.776
- Okay.
- It's hot.

28:40.785 --> 28:42.514
Sweetheart, I hate to say it...

28:42.620 --> 28:45.088
but we should've left the car
under the sun shelter.

28:45.156 --> 28:47.590
I know, sugarbush. Let's move it, Marcus.

28:52.764 --> 28:55.961
- What is it, candyface?
- I'm hungry.

29:05.009 --> 29:07.944
Very funny, isn't it?
But I happen to have a schedule.

29:08.012 --> 29:12.005
The trouble is, there's two of us.
That's the basis of the whole trouble.

29:12.917 --> 29:17.786
If I ever have a car, I swear I'll never pass
a single hitchhiker as long as I live.

29:27.031 --> 29:29.090
Must we dice with death?

29:33.838 --> 29:37.638
Since when has this car
got only two speeds, 110 and stop?

29:37.709 --> 29:41.338
- I'll tell you what, you drive.
- I'll tell you what, I'll walk.

29:41.412 --> 29:42.879
Okay, walk!

29:44.149 --> 29:46.379
Come on, Jo, don't be silly.

29:49.020 --> 29:52.217
You'd be far better off on your own,
wouldn't you?

29:52.323 --> 29:54.188
Oh, not again, Joanna!

29:54.259 --> 29:57.251
You want to get on, I know.
Maurice is waiting.

29:57.362 --> 29:58.659
Let him wait.

29:58.730 --> 30:01.597
He's got you on a line.
All he has to do is reel you in.

30:01.699 --> 30:05.100
Shut up about Maurice. If it weren't
for him, you know what we'd be?

30:05.236 --> 30:06.328
- Happy!
- Broke.

30:06.437 --> 30:07.529
Broke and happy.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.107
You wanna go back to living in a cellar?
You hated it.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.267
- I loved it.
- You hated it.

30:13.077 --> 30:14.476
I hated it.

30:15.046 --> 30:17.606
I hate being at other people's
beck and call.

30:17.715 --> 30:21.048
As soon as someone becks or calls,
I resent it, that's all.

30:21.119 --> 30:23.314
Okay, you run the show. You handle it.

30:23.421 --> 30:26.982
You worry about the house, the flat,
Nanny, and Mrs. Rathbone.

30:27.091 --> 30:29.116
I don't want any of them.

30:29.227 --> 30:32.822
Do I? Am I the one that wants
enamel sports watches?

30:34.299 --> 30:37.097
Take your watch. I don't want it.
I don't want anything.

30:37.168 --> 30:41.002
Why is it, when you give a woman what
she wants, she gets so bloody minded?

30:41.139 --> 30:44.802
You don't give me what I want.
You give me what you want to give me.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.807
Joanna, your watch.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.977
Joanna, I love you.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.531
Come on, Maurice is waiting.

31:11.469 --> 31:12.663
Bitch.

31:14.239 --> 31:17.675
Listen, sweetheart.
We're not going to make it together. See?

31:17.809 --> 31:20.573
We don't get the breaks.
So this is the kiss off.

31:20.678 --> 31:23.146
You take the high road,
I'll take the low road.

31:23.214 --> 31:26.012
We'll see who gets in where
before who. Okay?

31:26.751 --> 31:30.710
If we meet again, great.
If not, happy holidays.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.315
No hard feelings, but...

31:33.391 --> 31:35.416
- You have a schedule.
- Right.

32:28.246 --> 32:31.238
What happened to your slick friend
in the Alfa Romeo?

32:31.316 --> 32:34.444
I told him I was in love with you,
so he put me down.

32:45.663 --> 32:48.564
- I warn you...
- Don't.

33:07.452 --> 33:09.818
What would you say to a cup of coffee?

34:00.038 --> 34:03.804
What kind of people would sit like that
without a word to say to each other?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.433
Married people?

34:18.856 --> 34:21.484
This is definitely against my principles.

34:22.659 --> 34:26.152
Good. I wouldn't like to think
it happened all the time.

34:26.531 --> 34:30.831
I had absolutely no intention
of sleeping in hotels.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.538
You didn't?

34:36.407 --> 34:39.739
Hell, no. What do you think I brought
a sleeping sack for?

34:40.777 --> 34:43.110
I hadn't seriously thought about it.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.719
- Who are you?
- Some girl.

35:08.406 --> 35:09.839
Sleep well?

35:10.007 --> 35:13.170
I think that room was
over the plate-smashing annex.

35:13.744 --> 35:16.212
My days for roughing it are over.

35:16.414 --> 35:20.282
Next time, get Maurice to reserve us
a room if you can't remember yourself...

35:20.384 --> 35:24.878
preferably with a carpet, and
something else in the hot tap besides...

35:35.066 --> 35:37.466
All right, now when we're ready...

35:37.568 --> 35:39.866
it's Joanna in the hot seat...

35:40.238 --> 35:43.071
and Catherine the Great, the co-driver.
Okay?

35:45.810 --> 35:49.576
We've still got three weeks to go,
so you may as well make the best of it.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.979
Believe it or not,
I am making the best of it.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.176
- You wanted to come.
- Okay.

35:55.920 --> 35:59.185
Mommy, I don't want Joanna
to look at me.

35:59.857 --> 36:01.916
Ruthie, don't be so silly.

36:03.127 --> 36:05.391
Joanna, may I say something?

36:05.730 --> 36:08.790
This may sound
absolutely ridiculous to you.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.902
I know that you love Ruthie,
but she doesn't seem to realize it.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.564
I don't think you're getting through to her.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.870
She's gotten the idea
that you are hostile to her.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.601
May I make a suggestion?

36:22.947 --> 36:25.507
Why don't you woo her a little bit?

36:26.450 --> 36:29.544
- Woo her?
- That's right, woo her a little bit.

36:29.887 --> 36:33.516
Okay. Let's get this show on the road.

36:34.992 --> 36:36.983
Ruthie, honey. Come on.

36:45.670 --> 36:49.071
It has running hot and cold, bath...

36:50.007 --> 36:52.840
free garage, telephone...

36:54.879 --> 36:58.406
and transistor radios are not allowed
in the dining room.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.881
Sounds minimal, but I'll buy it.

37:00.985 --> 37:03.283
I don't want to go to a hotel.

37:03.354 --> 37:06.812
Our little home for the night, sweetness.
Of course, you do.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.381
I don't.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.228
May I have the keys back now, please?

37:21.339 --> 37:22.328
No!

37:24.175 --> 37:27.042
All right, we'll just have to stay here
all night.

37:28.212 --> 37:30.442
- Is that what you want?
- Yes!

37:33.751 --> 37:36.242
- With nothing to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.845
- She had a little snack...
- Cathy, please.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.025
Ruthie, give me that key.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.069
Don't you have a spare?

37:59.744 --> 38:02.941
If I used the spare, we don't have a spare.

38:05.082 --> 38:07.448
Mommy, I'm so tired.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.913
Do you still want a child?

38:12.923 --> 38:17.360
I still want a child.
I just don't want that child.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.060
We agreed before we were married...

38:21.132 --> 38:24.363
we weren't gonna have any children.

38:24.869 --> 38:27.838
And before we were married we didn't.

38:32.977 --> 38:36.913
Ruthie, you know, that was kind of
a funny thing you did with the key.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.147
Fast thinking.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.780
- Did you see where it landed?
- Yes.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.621
Good girl.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.324
- Where?
- I'm not going to tell you.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.962
- Tell your daddy at once!
- It's there.

39:01.138 --> 39:02.298
I wooed her.

39:09.413 --> 39:11.142
Your time's up, buddy.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.148
Breakfast is served.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.129
That's a good cup of tea.

39:30.501 --> 39:31.934
It's coffee!

39:32.336 --> 39:34.600
I knew it's a good cup of something.

39:35.906 --> 39:37.373
Okay, start her up.

39:47.518 --> 39:48.712
Let's go.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.190
Plenty of revs.

40:05.369 --> 40:07.269
- We stalled.
- You stalled.

40:07.705 --> 40:09.434
- You drive.
- No.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.165
I don't want to drive.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.968
You stalled.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.257
Done it!

41:49.139 --> 41:50.766
That should hold it for a while.

41:55.946 --> 41:57.777
Someone's having a bonfire.

41:58.215 --> 41:59.580
I love bonfires.

41:59.917 --> 42:03.182
One day we'll have a big garden
and grow lots of bonfires.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.158
Wood smoke is the smell I like best.
Hickory, for instance.

42:08.225 --> 42:10.557
- You ever smell hickory smoke?
- Never.

42:10.928 --> 42:13.192
I'll have to take you to the States.

42:13.264 --> 42:16.324
Alternatively, I could get Cathy
to send us a few cans.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.265
They really can it now. She could.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.927
She could bring it on her next trip.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.970
Don't tell me I detect a note of welcome.

42:22.072 --> 42:24.734
You can't expect her
not to want to see your baby.

42:24.875 --> 42:25.864
No.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.743
Hey, you're not...

42:32.950 --> 42:35.885
And this I suppose
was my little holiday surprise.

42:36.253 --> 42:39.120
I don't really suppose
it was much of a surprise.

42:40.424 --> 42:43.916
You know, you really have to have
everything you want, don't you?

42:44.662 --> 42:47.597
Are we supposed to celebrate?
What we gonna drink?

42:48.265 --> 42:49.459
Here we are.

42:54.972 --> 42:57.270
We're getting further south, all right.

42:57.341 --> 42:59.707
- It's certainly getting warmer.
- Right.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.573
Why don't they overtake
if they are gonna overtake?

43:06.650 --> 43:08.447
Mark! Fire!

43:08.552 --> 43:09.814
- Where?
- Here!

43:09.920 --> 43:11.785
Mark, we're on fire!

43:21.799 --> 43:23.426
I can't see!

43:36.313 --> 43:37.644
Water!

43:38.115 --> 43:39.776
- But where?
- Find some!

43:40.351 --> 43:41.375
Here.

43:44.722 --> 43:46.019
It likes water!

43:46.890 --> 43:48.653
- Stand back!
- What are you going to do?

43:48.726 --> 43:50.819
I'm going to stand back.
You think I'm crazy?

43:50.894 --> 43:53.954
- I have telephoned the pumpers.
- The fire brigade.

44:47.851 --> 44:50.285
Park the car in the shade this time.

44:50.387 --> 44:53.879
I don't want to come out after lunch
to a red-hot car again.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.423
What does "Reserve a la direction" mean?

44:58.762 --> 45:00.627
Reserved for the management.

45:00.731 --> 45:02.528
Hell, we're the customers.

45:06.904 --> 45:09.372
Why do you think Red China is a bitch?

45:11.875 --> 45:14.241
We can't stay here, Howie.

45:14.611 --> 45:18.012
I meant that Red China
was a very difficult problem.

45:18.082 --> 45:20.744
All right, Cathy, I'm moving.

45:24.922 --> 45:27.015
Over there, Howie. It's perfect.

45:27.291 --> 45:28.622
I saw them.

45:44.908 --> 45:46.068
Yes, Ruthie?

45:46.310 --> 45:48.278
Did you do that on purpose?

45:51.148 --> 45:56.313
No, Ruthie, I didn't. No, I did not.
No, Ruthie, no.

46:05.696 --> 46:07.789
- Do you love me?
- Now she asks.

46:08.699 --> 46:09.961
Do you?

46:10.868 --> 46:14.929
- Confessions extracted under torture...
- Do you?

46:15.139 --> 46:16.766
Yes!

46:19.977 --> 46:22.411
You're gonna get us thrown out of here.

46:22.846 --> 46:24.814
Actually it's not a bad idea.

46:25.749 --> 46:27.740
It's going to ruin us, anyway.

46:32.022 --> 46:33.421
This is heaven.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.418
- I could eat a horse.
- You may have to.

46:36.493 --> 46:39.929
- We've just gone on a diet.
- But we haven't had lunch.

46:39.997 --> 46:43.831
Baby, I'm not kidding. At these prices,
we can't afford to eat here.

46:46.804 --> 46:47.964
I'm starving.

46:48.071 --> 46:51.131
You'll just have to practice
a little self-restraint.

46:54.778 --> 46:56.939
I am not hungry.

46:57.047 --> 46:58.912
You are not hungry.

46:59.016 --> 47:01.450
We are not hungry.

47:02.152 --> 47:05.019
I am hungry! You are not hungry.

47:05.189 --> 47:10.024
Women in an advanced state of pregnancy
should be very careful about overeating.

47:10.127 --> 47:12.687
Advanced? I've got eight months to go!

47:13.530 --> 47:15.555
Must be some food shop in that village.

47:15.666 --> 47:19.295
I'm too worried about you
to dream about eating anything myself.

47:19.436 --> 47:23.372
I'll tell you what. I'll slip down
to the chemist and get you some... Guess.

47:25.242 --> 47:26.675
Hamburgers.

47:26.743 --> 47:30.679
Pills! That's right!

47:30.948 --> 47:35.578
Hamburger pills! Large hamburger pills!

47:35.853 --> 47:38.253
Don't let them see you bringing it in.

47:45.395 --> 47:46.760
What about food?

47:47.598 --> 47:48.860
What about food?

47:48.932 --> 47:52.299
We have to eat. Let's go
to the Domaine St. Juste, why not?

47:52.669 --> 47:55.638
- I'm not dressed.
- Baby, the last time we went there...

47:55.739 --> 47:58.765
I was dressed in soot
and you were wearing a blanket.

47:59.643 --> 48:01.372
I can change if you want me to.

48:01.445 --> 48:03.174
Change. I want you to.

48:17.861 --> 48:19.556
I'm still not done up.

48:57.267 --> 48:59.428
The lousy cops plugged me, sweetheart.

49:20.257 --> 49:22.487
Pills! Hamburger pills!

49:36.506 --> 49:40.966
What sort of people sit in a restaurant
and don't even try to talk to each other?

49:41.845 --> 49:43.142
Married people.

50:07.537 --> 50:11.200
You're the only woman I know who's
prepared to share a bed with a sardine.

50:11.308 --> 50:14.539
I don't care what kind of a sardine you are.
I like you.

50:16.613 --> 50:19.639
- Will you hate me when I'm bowfronted?
- Undoubtedly.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.814
- And will you be unfaithful to me?
- Blatantly.

50:24.054 --> 50:26.579
- You promised I could.
- You promised you wouldn't.

50:26.656 --> 50:28.214
When we got married.

50:30.627 --> 50:32.788
Do you mind undoing what you did?

50:41.538 --> 50:42.562
Thanks.

50:43.273 --> 50:44.501
You're welcome.

50:45.809 --> 50:47.834
Aren't you coming to bed at all?

50:48.845 --> 50:49.834
Tired?

50:53.683 --> 50:54.707
I won't be long.

50:54.818 --> 50:57.844
Shall I call your secretary
and make an appointment?

50:59.389 --> 51:01.914
When did you start being as snide as this?

51:04.661 --> 51:06.993
Right after we got married, didn't I?

51:07.898 --> 51:09.763
- Did we get married?
- Yeah.

51:11.101 --> 51:12.261
Remember?

51:12.803 --> 51:14.828
When sex stopped being fun.

51:15.505 --> 51:18.440
Yeah. It started being official.

51:20.710 --> 51:22.041
I remember.

51:35.692 --> 51:39.128
I think that lovely little lake
breeds lovely little mosquitoes.

51:39.196 --> 51:42.063
- I'll close the window.
- We'll suffocate.

52:04.121 --> 52:07.454
- We just have to pretend they don't exist.
- All right.

52:08.058 --> 52:10.549
- Good night.
- Good night, little mother.

52:15.532 --> 52:18.865
- They do exist.
- No, they don't.

52:21.271 --> 52:22.738
They do.

52:23.974 --> 52:25.407
I've had an idea.

52:26.810 --> 52:28.539
- Sleep well?
- Very well.

52:28.745 --> 52:30.269
I had a dreamy dream.

52:31.114 --> 52:32.581
Tell me the worst.

52:33.250 --> 52:37.277
I dreamt you built us the most beautiful
little Wallace-designed house.

52:38.822 --> 52:42.485
And I built the most beautiful
little Wallace-designed triplets.

52:42.926 --> 52:45.759
All we need right now
is a population explosion.

52:57.941 --> 53:00.034
You did not need the mosquito net?

53:07.784 --> 53:09.411
We managed without it.

53:16.626 --> 53:17.888
No breakfast?

53:19.629 --> 53:21.324
Religious reasons.

53:26.303 --> 53:29.898
We gotta get out of this place.
This self-denial is killing me.

53:31.441 --> 53:34.706
I'm sorry you were not able to sample
our restaurant last night.

53:34.811 --> 53:37.439
So were we. It was religious reasons.

53:37.514 --> 53:41.211
Particularly when we have to charge you
an all-inclusive price...

53:41.318 --> 53:42.876
- as you see.
- Beg your pardon?

53:42.986 --> 53:46.615
High season. Our price includes
dinner and breakfast always.

53:47.290 --> 53:48.314
Always.

53:52.696 --> 53:53.822
Thank you.

53:54.297 --> 53:57.460
I think the inspector is waiting
for you outside.

53:57.534 --> 53:58.694
Inspector?

53:58.802 --> 54:01.930
Concerning the expenses
for the pumpers and such like.

54:03.473 --> 54:05.498
We will see you again, I hope.

54:07.177 --> 54:11.443
What's French for "I don't believe you and
you're not going to get a damn penny"?

54:31.635 --> 54:32.727
- Tax?
- Tax.

54:33.603 --> 54:34.627
Tax on what?

54:46.583 --> 54:50.417
This is literally highway robbery.
I mean, this is literally highway robbery.

54:50.520 --> 54:53.512
- Don't lose your temper.
- I'm not losing my temper.

55:00.397 --> 55:01.989
Dispose of the wreck.

55:06.736 --> 55:07.725
Where?

55:10.674 --> 55:11.834
Come on, Jo.

55:22.886 --> 55:25.320
You think I'm deaf. I can hear you.

55:47.143 --> 55:49.873
<i>You are mad! You are ill!</i>

55:50.647 --> 55:52.444
We disposed of it.

55:55.251 --> 55:58.948
<i>Who is going to pay me? Because if you</i>
<i>think the insurance will pay...</i>

55:59.322 --> 56:01.483
<i>The insurance companies are never</i>
<i>in a hurry.</i>

56:01.591 --> 56:03.718
<i>I had a barn which burnt two years ago...</i>

56:03.827 --> 56:06.557
<i>I haven't been paid back for it yet.</i>

56:06.663 --> 56:08.358
<i>And nobody will give me</i>
<i>a barn like this.</i>

56:08.898 --> 56:11.731
<i>It was very dangerous.</i>
<i>They could have killed someone.</i>

56:19.609 --> 56:21.975
<i>It is unbelievable</i>
<i>anyone could be so clumsy.</i>

56:32.389 --> 56:33.583
This is the life.

56:33.656 --> 56:36.887
He let me down, I must tell you.
Quite disgracefully.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.053
So I'm looking for an architect.

56:39.562 --> 56:41.325
My husband's an architect.

56:44.434 --> 56:47.562
So you put up buildings
as well as knocking them down.

56:47.804 --> 56:50.398
- Corporation...
- He doesn't have a minute to spare.

56:50.874 --> 56:52.398
What about now?

56:53.209 --> 56:54.972
He has a minute to spare.

56:55.779 --> 56:58.304
Good. We must talk.

56:58.715 --> 57:00.945
No, I must tell you, I'm in a corner.

57:07.724 --> 57:08.986
Communist.

57:09.225 --> 57:11.386
- Are you all right, honey?
- Yes.

57:14.330 --> 57:15.627
Hey, Chantilly.

57:16.266 --> 57:19.394
- Isn't that in the guidebook?
- It could just be.

57:19.636 --> 57:20.898
Do let's stop.

57:21.137 --> 57:24.106
I don't want Ruthie to be late
for her lunch today.

57:24.340 --> 57:26.808
Yes. It's off the main road.

57:27.043 --> 57:30.171
Howie, I may as well warn you
before we get to Greece...

57:30.280 --> 57:32.714
that the Acropolis is off the main road.

57:35.151 --> 57:37.051
This is a democratic trip.

58:22.966 --> 58:26.094
Really great to dawdle
through an old place like that.

58:27.637 --> 58:29.537
Joanna, I have to thank you.

58:29.739 --> 58:32.640
I thought you didn't like Joanna, Daddy.

58:35.245 --> 58:36.769
Of course I like Joanna.

58:36.913 --> 58:40.906
Then why did Mommy say
she was a suburban English nobody?

58:45.522 --> 58:50.391
I think it may be very important to the
future of our quadripartite relationship...

58:51.694 --> 58:54.663
to get that particular remark
into very clear context.

58:54.731 --> 58:58.497
I think it might be best for the future
of our quadripartite relationship...

58:58.568 --> 59:02.197
if we accepted the fact, here and now,
that it has no future whatsoever.

59:02.338 --> 59:04.533
Mark, please don't be too hasty.

59:04.674 --> 59:06.403
We're through, Howard.

59:06.509 --> 59:09.137
Hey, those things took a lot of arranging.

59:09.212 --> 59:12.306
Now, you listen to me.
Try and imagine how Joanna feels.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.247
I can see how Joanna feels.

59:14.350 --> 59:18.343
She's gonna feel that the whole trip
has been loused up because of her.

59:18.821 --> 59:22.689
- Howard, you are the most complacent...
- Abuse me if you want to.

59:22.759 --> 59:23.851
I want to.

59:23.927 --> 59:27.158
You are gonna dominate that girl
right out of existence.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.721
I'm gonna smash your face in, Howie.

59:30.600 --> 59:33.501
That isn't a very adult attitude,
if I may say so.

59:33.603 --> 59:36.595
Marcus, please. That's the phonograph.

59:36.739 --> 59:38.206
Mark, please.

59:40.243 --> 59:42.234
Come on, darling. Come on, sweetheart.

59:42.378 --> 59:46.872
You haven't asked Joanna if she wants
to abandon the expedition at this point.

59:46.950 --> 59:48.212
Come on, baby.

59:48.718 --> 59:52.484
That, if I may say so,
is a very revealing usage.

59:52.755 --> 59:57.886
Calling her baby shows you're prepared
to do her thinking and deciding.

59:58.127 --> 01:00:00.220
Now I warn you solemnly, Marcus.

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:04.596
You're denying Joanna the right
to be her own paradoxical self.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:09.227
Howard, you're the largest pocket
of untapped natural gas known to man.

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:28.023
They haven't even opened yet.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.521
- What is it about?
- Who knows?

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.626
- What do people have rows about?
- Money, sex.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:39.063
Sex, money. He wants, she doesn't want.

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:41.135
She wants, he doesn't want.

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:44.297
He thinks that the counter
is all in the wrong place.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.998
Counter and display cases. It's very funny.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.646
Yeah, that's marriage for you.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.676
That's marriage for them.

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:55.548
That's marriage. Full stop.

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.954
I'm allowed not to like Howard and Cathy.
They're my friends.

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:04.824
You never wanted to enjoy the trip.
You were jealous of Cathy before we left.

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:08.124
It's no bliss to be in a car
with three Maxwell Manchesters.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:11.257
You promised when we were married,
you'd always be happy.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.030
- I know.
- Why can't you always be happy?

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.501
Because I can't.

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.299
You mean you broke your promise.

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.869
I am happy, usually.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:26.238
I love you, if that's any good.

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:28.414
That's not the issue.

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:31.213
If it isn't, it should be the issue.

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:35.383
- You're right.
- I'm right?

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:39.085
You're right. Let's find a hotel.

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:42.487
1:00 in the afternoon.
What do we want a hotel for?

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.257
Let's find a hotel.

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.560
To hell with the Maxwell Manchesters.

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.731
Mister, Missus and Miss.

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:54.304
In future, we travel alone together,
or not at all.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.480
<i>My darling Joanna:</i>

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:01.908
<i>So far</i>, <i>all goes well.</i>

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:06.343
<i>The car's nearly run in</i>
<i>and my patience nearly run out.</i>

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.387
<i>I miss you like mad.</i>

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.392
<i>I drove nearly all night last night.</i>

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.756
<i>Couldn't face one of our hotels</i>
<i>without you with me.</i>

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:20.265
<i>I finally slept in the car...</i>

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:23.997
<i>quite near where we buried</i>
<i>the poor old burnt-out MG.</i>

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:29.372
<i>I wish to hell I hadn't had to make the trip.</i>

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:33.246
<i>I suppose</i>, <i>what with the house</i>
<i>and Caroline...</i>

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.546
<i>it's just as well that I've got some work.</i>

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:38.553
<i>At least this pays better</i>
<i>than corporation bus shelter.</i>

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:41.613
<i>And it's a lot more interesting</i>, <i>too</i>,
<i>let's face it.</i>

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.917
<i>I think about you all the time.</i>

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:47.252
<i>It's been a pretty uneventful drive so far.</i>

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.163
<i>It's a long and dull road</i>
<i>when you're on your own.</i>

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:55.093
<i>All I care about is getting down there</i>
<i>and doing whatever has to be done...</i>

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:56.934
<i>and getting the hell back.</i>

01:02:57.206 --> 01:03:00.869
<i>When I'm not being woken at 3:00</i>
<i>in the morning</i>, <i>I feel very paternal.</i>

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.434
<i>And I miss you both more than I can say.</i>

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.479
<i>Life's very flat.</i>

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.751
<i>I shall probably drive on overnight...</i>

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:11.651
<i>tonight and get down to the site</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:14.481
<i>Two or three sessions</i>
<i>with a far-famed client...</i>

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.114
<i>should be more than enough.</i>

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:18.885
<i>It's typical of me</i>
<i>that as soon as I get away...</i>

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.657
<i>all I want to do is to get back to you again.</i>

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:24.423
<i>I won't write any more at the moment...</i>

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.730
<i>because I really do want to get on.</i>

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:30.464
<i>As soon as I have a chance</i>,
<i>I'll drop you another line.</i>

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.829
<i>Love...</i>

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:36.433
<i>Mark.</i>

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:38.470
<i>PS:</i>

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:43.176
<i>Next time we come away</i>, <i>we shall have</i>
<i>our own little Ruthiebelle with us.</i>

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.124
I don't want any more, Mommy.

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:51.488
Do you want to finish it?

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.320
Boiled egg for supper, Carol?

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:30.321
Make sure Carol doesn't fall
out of the window...

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.458
or eat any chairs or anything, darling.

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.593
Can you?

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.862
While I wash out a few things
for the morning.

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:05.089
Come on in.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:17.237
Come here.

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:24.081
- Has it come yet?
- What?

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:26.484
Carol's supper.

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:28.818
I don't know.

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:31.849
Couldn't you see what's happening to it?

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.263
I thought you were watching Caroline!

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:40.558
I'm sorry, but I've got to see
His Majesty The Client tomorrow.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.433
I've got to get this finished.

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:47.037
I'll go.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:48.972
Don't bother.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.208
I'll go!

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.022
It's not possible. Where's our eggs?

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:05.490
We've been waiting half an hour
for an egg.

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:13.357
- I must ask you...
- I must ask you.

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.165
You are disturbing the other guests.

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:18.263
I want that egg in five minutes
or we're leaving.

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:23.109
We're leaving!

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:26.147
- Leaving?
- Leaving.

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:30.716
- But Caroline's in her pajamas.
- Caroline can leave in her pajamas.

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:33.378
They don't want us here.
We're not staying.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:37.916
I'm sorry, but I refuse to be insulted
by a fifth-rate doss house, and that's it.

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:41.422
I ask you for a boiled egg,
and you return with an eviction order.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.192
I've told you we're leaving. Now let's go.

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.065
Let's go!

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:49.064
"He never got home to early tea"

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.400
Do it again.

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:58.338
"The bumblebee, the bumblebee
He flew away from the tulip tree

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:01.007
"He made a mistake and flew into the lake

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:03.449
"And he never got home to early tea"

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.449
Daddy, do the duck.

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:18.425
Thank you.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.822
It was all my fault, I know.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:48.525
I've been telling Caroline
bedtime stories for an hour.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:51.259
It'd be nice if you could avoid fortissimo
for a while.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:55.997
Look! I quit that hotel because
they didn't bring you what you wanted.

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:57.805
I didn't want a boiled egg.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.000
I suppose Caroline has nothing
to do with you.

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.475
You were the one who wanted a child.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.138
Why don't you wake her up
and tell her that.

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:08.683
I don't want to tell her. I'm telling you.
I love Caroline.

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:11.316
You don't know what love is.

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:15.817
That's tough on me.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:21.988
All you can do is take the salute
at an endless march-past of yourself.

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:49.357
I have an appetite. Do you?

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:53.724
Wouldn't matter who I was, would it?

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:06.705
I'm willing to call it a day.
Do you want to call it a day?

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:10.868
- You never wanted to call it anything else.
- You're damn right there.

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:31.462
- We can't even have a fight in peace.
- Leave me.

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.126
Selfish.

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:29.618
They call it the Mediterranean, my lady.

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.123
Come, it's time to swim.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.294
I don't understand sex.

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.629
Don't worry, it doesn't show.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:43.831
Seriously, why do we enjoy it more
when it means less.

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.968
Because it isn't personal anymore.

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:49.542
Not personal?

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:52.175
That's right.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:07.786
"Too late," they cried. "Too late."

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:25.113
I'm so happy.

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:27.539
I love you.

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:36.217
Find us a big bed.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.926
- Tired?
- No.

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:44.156
Come on.

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:52.566
- End of romantic gesture.
- That didn't last very long.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.198
I believe in short romances.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.710
So do I. Short and happy romances.

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:59.043
Last one in bed turns the lights out.

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:00.547
I'll beat you!

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:15.526
Worth a try.

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:31.670
Cheat!

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.072
You know what I dreamt?

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:00.306
What did you dream?

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.604
I dreamt that a train...

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:07.115
drove slap-bang through the middle
of the room in the night.

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:10.015
Mr. Freud, what big ears you've got.

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:13.677
The better to analyze you with, my dear.

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.450
You said it.

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:19.288
Nothing at all to do with sex whatsoever.

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:23.230
I think I certainly am not as frustrated.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:27.202
That's your story. Try and sell it to Freud.

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.592
Sexy, wasn't it?

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:55.129
Okay, you're not frustrated.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.584
- Hot.
- Scalding already.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:29.088
- Shouldn't get too much sun the first day.
- I don't burn. I've got asbestos skin.

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:32.857
- In, come on.
- No.

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:37.866
Get your shirt off. Come on!

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.711
This must be very near
the Garden of Eden.

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.959
Do you know what marriage is?

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:35.527
You tell me and see
if we are thinking of the same thing.

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:40.364
Marriage is when the woman
asks the man to take off his pajamas.

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:44.571
And it's because she wants
to send them to the laundry.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.939
- Good?
- Yeah. Very good.

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:57.446
- I'm hungry and thirsty.
- You're never satisfied.

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.348
What's wrong with being hungry?

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:03.187
It's time you realize that all human
appetites are profoundly degrading...

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:05.157
with the exception of lust.

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:17.361
What if we could just clap our hands
and someone would bring us a menu?

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:27.248
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could just clap our hands...

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.840
and make all these people disappear?

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:42.352
Just as well, you wouldn't really like it.

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.443
What do we do?

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:02.415
Stand very still for several days.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.051
Maybe it will go away.

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:08.453
I don't want to stand very still.
I don't want to stand still at all.

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:11.725
Nor do I.

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:14.058
Come back next week.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.193
Did that hurt?

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:40.684
It's the first time you've said my name
as if you really mean it.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.356
I really mean it.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:51.621
- We have a week, asbestos.
- I'm not asbestos.

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:57.770
You're not really going to rejoin
those poxy choirgirls, are you?

01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:00.569
I promised. We have a week.

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:03.639
A week?

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:07.881
To hell with it.

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.018
It will only hurt for a minute.

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.547
This is the life, eh, darling?

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:17.550
- Your wife is happy?
- Yes.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:20.486
It doesn't take much to make her happy.

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:23.826
A villa, swimming pool, champagne,
simple things like that.

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:25.263
You're not angry?

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.733
- Angry?
- Not to be alone together.

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:30.233
No, we can always be alone together.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:34.005
I am waiting to hear from Palamos
about a meeting.

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:36.168
Then I will show you the whole project.

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:39.538
- Well, if you are interested.
- Sure, I am interested.

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:42.677
Perhaps you will have to stay
a few more days.

01:18:42.784 --> 01:18:45.048
- Shall you mind?
- I'll suffer.

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:47.781
Game.

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:51.386
Ready?

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.800
Come on, darling, give.

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.066
Too late.

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:12.504
Come on, sweetheart, we're playing.

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:15.310
Sweetheart, you've been playing
for two hours.

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.115
Hello.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.949
Palamos, I was going to call you.

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:30.124
I am calling you. I see.

01:19:30.465 --> 01:19:32.899
Honey, give me the ball.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:47.077
- Get the ball.
- You get it, it's your game.

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:49.377
I've got sneakers on, and things.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:52.750
Very pretty.
Did Francoise lend them to you?

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.718
Got a guest pair. Get the ball.

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:57.422
- They are probably her son's.
- Get the ball.

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.084
Or her grandson's.

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:02.721
Will you stop this insane jealousy
and get that ball.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.122
There it is.

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:09.733
- Come on.
- No. Put me down.

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:15.071
- Will you get the ball?
- Certainly not.

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.306
- Get it.
- There.

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:26.011
We meet Palamos for drinks at 6:00.

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:29.318
We talk about the whole scheme
and then we make a decision.

01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:30.584
Fine.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:40.056
Now I've got my shoes wet
and everything. I'll probably catch a cold.

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:43.798
- How long do we have to stay here?
- You got us into this, sugar.

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:46.100
You sold me to Maurice
and you were right:

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:49.609
- A chance like this doesn't come everyday.
- Thank God!

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:50.934
Lunch!

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:55.708
I see you at 6:00,
and then I bring the genius with me.

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.720
Will you please sit down here?

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:08.661
Tonight we all go to the gala
and everything is fixed.

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.287
We'll see Palamos there.

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.730
I don't have any suitable clothes for a gala.

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:16.100
- Then I borrow you.
- There you are. Francoise will borrow you.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:20.842
- Do you mind eating caviar?
- No, if we must.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.476
- Do you like galas?
- Some galas.

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:32.017
Please, could you ring for the butler?

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:37.288
The only thing wrong
with this part of the world...

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:38.758
is there's not much of a sunset.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.608
How can a week pass so quickly?

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:01.346
We made the mistake
of enjoying ourselves.

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:08.985
Don't go tomorrow. Just don't.

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:12.151
Let's not talk about it. Let's not.

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:16.623
All right, we won't.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.165
We agreed.

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:37.207
You were marvelous, darling.
Absolutely marvelous.

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:39.276
- I was?
- And so funny.

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:42.549
The way you told the story
about the sunshade.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:45.184
You charmed the pants off Palamos.

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:48.126
That wouldn't be too difficult to do,
would it?

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:51.430
I knew you'd enjoy it once we got there.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:55.435
- I hated it once we got there.
- Why?

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:59.868
Why? Because I'm tired
of being a parasite.

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:03.172
I want to go. I want to be on our own.

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:07.012
We haven't been here very long.

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:11.016
We've been here month after month
for two whole days.

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:17.625
- I am going to work for the man.
- Well, I'm not.

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.722
Treats by Maurice.

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.760
What should we call the baby?

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:32.273
What baby?

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:35.299
Our baby.

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:37.506
The Baby, I guess.

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:44.146
- What is it?
- I'm trying to imagine you fat.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:50.120
- What is it?
- I'm trying to imagine you thin.

01:23:57.165 --> 01:24:01.693
As I said to the Duchess, "If you want
to be a duchess, be a duchess.

01:24:02.604 --> 01:24:05.266
"If you want to make love, hats off."

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:32.764
Darling, I'll meet you here, right here,
10 years from now. Is it a deal?

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:35.200
You'll be building skyscrapers
10 miles high...

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:37.463
you'll never be able to get down in time.

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:40.541
I'll always think of this place as ours.

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.007
Here comes Daddy.

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.177
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:20.475
If you think I'll wait for 10 years
and then turn up and say "what ho!"

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.539
Nobody wants you to say "what ho!"

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.210
- Say "darling."
- Or darling or anything else.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.914
- I never want to see you again.
- Then don't.

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:31.858
- I hate you.
- Joanna, listen.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.087
We went into this with our eyes open.
Nobody deceived anyone else.

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:38.722
So stop playing the ruined virgin!

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.869
It's a tune I've heard before
and I didn't like it then.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:46.373
Anyway, you're the one
who's insisting on going back...

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:50.100
to your damned choir!
Joanna, I don't want you to go!

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:54.306
You do. You just want me to become
a beautiful memory. The sooner the better.

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:57.077
Who said anything about beautiful?
Will you come here!

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:00.019
- I never want to see you again.
- Not much...

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:01.911
As long as I live!

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:06.322
I've decided we should get married.

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:08.328
- What do you say?
- Yes.

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:15.368
- I won't ever let you down.
- I will you.

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:18.866
I don't care what you do
just as long as I've got you.

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:24.234
- You won't be sorry, sir.
- You will.

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:25.537
Never.

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:35.783
We are all down here!

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:41.159
I want you to have lunch
with Jeanine and Nanny.

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:43.162
Won't that be nice?

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:46.058
And afterwards you all can go for a swim.

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:50.929
You are naughty.
We were expecting you yesterday.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.337
- I am sorry.
- You are very naughty.

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:55.371
Who don't you know?

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:58.441
This is Nick and Michelle. You know them.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.480
And Mark and Maurice.

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:04.709
Have you met Joanna?

01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:11.320
- Hello.
- Joanna Wallace, my brother David.

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:12.620
- How are you?
- Hello.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:15.252
She's tired and overheated
and has a headache...

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:18.094
but apart from that, she's fine.
Thank you very much.

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:21.226
Mark, I think you are horrible.
I think he's horrible.

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:23.497
Mark, I have given Michelle an island.

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:27.004
When you are finished here
you must come and build us a nest.

01:27:27.108 --> 01:27:29.872
- You'll be lucky, Nicky.
- I am lucky.

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:34.546
Mark, I must tell you
I can't hear myself drink.

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:08.040
And they never got home to early tea.

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:40.040
Good morning. Coffee?

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.243
Good morning. Thank you.

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.245
Caroline sends you her love.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.624
- Did you spend the night here?
- Yes.

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:57.192
It's very comfortable.

01:28:58.266 --> 01:29:01.360
- You've stayed here before, have you?
- Once or twice.

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:21.119
Do you mind if I speak with Joanna alone?

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:22.787
But of course.

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:40.939
Did you sleep in the same room?

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.614
In other words you...

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:11.703
Are you in love?

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:18.141
After only one day?

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:23.010
I see.

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:26.217
- I'm like that.
- Are you?

01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:31.881
How many times has it happened before,
you being like that?

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:35.521
Twice, you and David.

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.562
I thought I was going to last a lifetime.

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:52.639
I never meant it to happen.

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:58.780
- We just suddenly found that we...
- Got on?

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:05.984
- Lf you like.
- I'm absolutely mad about the idea.

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:21.775
You really mustn't
blame yourself, you know.

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:24.776
You've got an infernal bloody gall,
I must say.

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:27.780
I don't bloody blame myself, I blame you.

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:29.315
But that is ridiculous.

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:31.908
Look, Joanna's my wife,
or hadn't you heard?

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:34.546
Since some time
you have not loved Joanna.

01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:37.450
I am not taking her away from you.

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:41.286
We are simply going away together
for a time.

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:44.621
Thanks. That's really set my mind at rest.

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:47.830
I am sorry
we did not know each other longer.

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:51.735
- It would have been easier.
- Yeah, and more fun.

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:56.939
Then you could have had the supreme
pleasure of taking your friend's wife.

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:58.807
That's real kicks?

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:16.424
Why don't you come out?

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:19.762
Palamos won't mind!

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:32.212
Not that one!

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:35.344
There's still life in it!

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:53.765
The whole world is changing
out of all recognition.

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:58.572
There is no such thing
as permanence anymore.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:03.005
- No, I suppose not.
- And we should be glad.

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:05.979
I suppose so.

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:18.992
What kind of people just sit
without a word to say to each other?

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.028
- Married people.
- Exactly.

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.731
- It's so sad.
- No, my darling.

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.496
That is not sad.

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:35.902
When something is finished,
one must say, "It's finished."

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:43.039
I'll always love you, always,
no matter what.

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.484
- No matter what?
- Yes.

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:51.214
- As long as I don't catch you.
- Lf you catch me, you can keep me.

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:56.722
<i>There comes a time when one must grow.</i>

01:33:57.765 --> 01:34:00.325
<i>When the old things</i>
<i>are not amusing anymore.</i>

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:07.231
How is that!

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.100
Painful!

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:12.440
That was out, you pregnant sow.
Plumb out, leg before driftwood.

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:16.080
- Pregnant what?
- Pregnant sow.

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:35.401
You'll have to come out eventually.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:44.667
Help!

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:16.204
Bastard!

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:23.841
Give us a kiss.

01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:30.784
You must decide.

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:34.852
I know.

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:03.617
Hello.

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.536
I am back.

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:24.033
Enjoy yourself?

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.073
Yes, thank you.

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:37.388
But I missed you.

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:41.691
I did.

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:45.090
Why?

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:50.294
Because he is so serious.

01:36:51.939 --> 01:36:54.430
I thought you like people who are serious.

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.700
But he is so serious.

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:02.580
You want me to make some funny faces?

01:37:03.584 --> 01:37:06.178
You don't need to make funny faces.

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:15.956
Mark, I am back.

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:22.699
You humiliate me...

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:30.005
then you come back.

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:37.250
That's right.

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:44.280
Thank God.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.611
Are you sure
you remember which one I am?

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.405
I've been stupid. So stupid.

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:17.176
We both.

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:20.914
It was always me, really.
You were always the one...

01:39:21.422 --> 01:39:23.549
- I am sorry.
- Let's forget it.

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:25.750
- Can we forget it?
- Can you?

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:27.587
I can.

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:30.858
I am just glad you are back.
That's all I care about.

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:32.262
Well, I am back.

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:36.430
We should have parted then.

01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:39.403
- Why didn't we?
- I didn't have the courage.

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:43.968
You didn't have the courage?
What courage did you need?

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:46.978
The courage to see
that what was finished was finished.

01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:49.339
And what was finished?

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:52.942
- You know bloody well what was finished.
- Yes, I do.

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:56.116
David and me. And we finished. So?

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:59.787
Both of us know you're hoping
David will be there. Why pretend?

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.795
I'm not pretending.
I do hope he will be there.

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.827
- See.
- I like him.

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:06.863
I'll have someone to talk to...

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:11.097
when Maurice drags you off for one
of his 10-minute chats for six hours.

01:40:11.238 --> 01:40:14.139
I am not having any 10-minute chats
with Maurice.

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:22.045
Pin on a nice smile, darling,
we're almost there.

01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:40.032
Joanna thought they'd make
a nice addition to the living pit.

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.567
Bless you both.

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:44.070
Prettier than ever.

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:47.039
Prettier than ever.

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:50.141
Everyone is admiring the house so much,
I can't tell you.

01:40:50.244 --> 01:40:52.974
Tell me.
I can't stand praise unless I have it.

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.378
This is a beautiful house. Congratulations.

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:57.417
You must be the architect.

01:40:57.484 --> 01:41:00.317
- I just love the high ceilings.
- And the low floors?

01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:02.147
Precious.

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:05.749
You'll never believe this,
this is the wildest coincidence imaginable.

01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:10.262
When I was en route to the airport,
who do you think I should bump into?

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:12.161
Metaphorically speaking of course.

01:41:12.232 --> 01:41:15.759
Howard and Cathy Maxwell Manchester,
on their way back from the hospital.

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:18.861
She's been undergoing surgery
for a particularly...

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:22.375
I'm very happy to say the doctors
have given her a hopeful prognosis.

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:25.445
Anyhow, they told me to call you
when I got to Europe.

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:27.479
What a charming couple you were
and so on.

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:30.948
When I called Yvonne and found out
that you'd built their new home...

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:33.042
- well, you could imagine.
- Right.

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.588
Isn't that
the wildest coincidence imaginable?

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:38.819
- Yes, isn't it?
- You've done the most fantastic things.

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:41.827
- I guess you must be a very happy man.
- I guess so.

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:44.261
And your wife is such a darling.

01:41:44.331 --> 01:41:47.823
I've heard a lot about her. You have
a wonderful little boy, haven't you?

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.301
Actually we have got
a wonderful little girl.

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:53.804
That's right. A wonderful little girl.
I want to tell you...

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:57.970
I'm happy to see a bright, talented man
like you break right through to the top.

01:41:58.045 --> 01:42:00.206
I wish Howard and Cathy
were here to see it...

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.647
because, believe me,
they believed in you right from the start...

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:05.877
- if not before.
- Come along.

01:42:09.323 --> 01:42:12.087
- Mr. Wallace, telephone for you.
- Thank you.

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.491
Follow me, sir, I plug you in.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.459
Follow me. He plugs me in.

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:25.766
- They call you from America.
- They call me from America.

01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:28.472
They call me from here,
call me from there...

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:31.170
they call me
from every bloody where. Hello.

01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:34.879
Hello, Hal, how are you?
It's Hal Van Benius.

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.382
What's the story?

01:42:37.985 --> 01:42:40.317
It's fixed. That's wonderful.

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:42.484
Yeah. When do we start?

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:46.949
Yesterday, I can't do.
I have things I have to do yesterday.

01:42:50.164 --> 01:42:51.859
Rome, Friday? Yeah.

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.392
I've got it.

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:57.800
I'll see you then. Great. Bye.

01:42:58.872 --> 01:43:00.032
Rome, Friday.

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:03.665
- So, you're very much a success?
- Incredibly much. Come on.

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:08.505
Shall we dance?

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:15.287
I think it's a little bit too early
in the evening for that.

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:18.051
Is it ever too early in the evening for that?

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:21.719
You are here, no one tells me a thing.
I'm repairing the electrics...

01:43:21.828 --> 01:43:24.058
which you should have been here to check.

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:25.961
No one tells me you're arriving.

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:28.292
There are many things I want to discuss...

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:30.962
- I'm with my fiancée.
- How do you do?

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:33.631
We'll go somewhere quiet,
then we'll have a long talk.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:37.198
- I thought this was going to be a party.
- Please, I have problems.

01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:39.244
What's the name of your fiancée again?

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:42.372
I don't know, I haven't asked.
What's your name, darling?

01:43:44.551 --> 01:43:46.041
She's very pretty.

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:48.783
But you have divorced Joanna?

01:43:49.256 --> 01:43:50.484
I don't understand.

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:54.584
Anyway, the main question is
when are you free?

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:05.831
I want you to meet my fiancée,
Sylvia Albino.

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.871
David has been telling me about you.

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.876
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:44:11.478 --> 01:44:13.776
I had a phone call from Hal Van Benius.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.075
- And?
- I got the job.

01:44:16.483 --> 01:44:17.780
Good.

01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:25.255
- You're going to the States?
- Only for two years.

01:44:25.492 --> 01:44:28.427
Then you must spare me 10 minutes.
I need your advice, Mark.

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:30.963
We'll see him in Rome on Friday
on his way through.

01:44:31.064 --> 01:44:32.224
Ten minutes.

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:38.434
I've heard the wonderful news about you
and this beautiful girl.

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:42.770
If you two can be as happy as those
two wonderful people over there...

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:44.504
and have a marriage like theirs...

01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:47.011
you haven't got a thing to worry about.

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:54.810
You see, Mark, my problem is very simple
but very complicated.

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:57.049
So you must spare me 10 minutes.

01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:59.486
Only 10 minutes, please.

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:05.428
You are the obvious man
since it was your original conception.

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:08.662
And I think it only fair
that you see what you can do...

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:14.230
Everybody jump, please.

01:45:15.809 --> 01:45:17.538
Thank you.

01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:21.106
I think you should be there to supervise...

01:45:28.288 --> 01:45:30.279
I hate those occasions.

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:33.115
I hate those occasions.
You love those occasions.

01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:34.490
I love you.

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:36.660
And I love you.

01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:42.735
How long is this gonna go on?

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:46.372
- How long is what gonna go on?
- The pretence that we're happy.

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:48.440
You've never pretended.
Who's pretending?

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:51.705
You are. That we're happily married
and you wanted to stay with me.

01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:53.746
Those are two entirely different things.

01:45:53.847 --> 01:45:55.610
You don't have to tell me.

01:45:57.417 --> 01:46:00.648
If you had someone to go to you'd leave.
You don't have to tell me.

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:03.519
- Why are you still here?
- Because I'm not you.

01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:07.524
How long are you gonna
go on resenting the past?

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:10.561
Who's talking? Just who is talking?

01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:13.695
I'm talking.
What would you do if we got a divorce?

01:46:14.701 --> 01:46:15.725
Cry.

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:19.067
- Yeah, like for how long?
- I don't know.

01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:22.675
- Why would we get a divorce?
- What if I died or didn't exist?

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:26.679
If I hadn't had chickenpox
I'd have had chickenpox... I don't know.

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:29.842
I love you.

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:31.712
Well, then.

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:39.624
What would you do if I didn't exist?

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.891
Probably marry David.

01:46:45.031 --> 01:46:47.397
But you do exist.

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:52.171
You knew the answer,
so why did you ask the question?

01:46:52.272 --> 01:46:54.035
Because I knew the answer.

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:58.110
There'll never be anyone else like you
in my life.

01:46:58.178 --> 01:46:59.805
- You promise?
- I hope.

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:03.916
It's you who can't accept it.

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:05.611
What can't I accept?

01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:08.085
Why do you stop the car
every time I say something?

01:47:08.188 --> 01:47:09.678
What can't I accept?

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:12.614
That we're a fixture, that we're married.

01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:16.362
You go on about my leaving you
and I'm always still here.

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:19.399
- Sure you don't want me to leave you?
- Positive.

01:47:23.136 --> 01:47:25.263
Why do you think I'm here?

01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:27.934
I don't know. That's the whole thing.

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:30.770
That's the whole thing,
you never stop to think.

01:47:32.846 --> 01:47:34.609
I've stopped to think.

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:37.574
Stop thinking.

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.086
Now?

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:50.821
Here?

01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:56.962
- I love happy endings.
- You're just plain immoral.

01:47:57.637 --> 01:48:00.128
How can it be immoral if we are married?

01:48:01.174 --> 01:48:03.267
We're gonna have to get a divorce.

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:29.430
- Come on, Howie.
- Okay.

01:48:59.533 --> 01:49:02.593
You have to admit it, we've changed.

01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:06.031
- I admit it. We've changed.
- It's sad, but there it is.

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:07.795
Life.

01:49:08.675 --> 01:49:13.374
At least you're not a bad-tempered,
disorganized, conceited failure anymore.

01:49:14.915 --> 01:49:19.648
You're a bad-tempered, disorganized,
conceited success.

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.458
Wait a minute.

01:49:35.569 --> 01:49:38.231
No, my passport's in here.
It must be in here somewhere.

01:49:38.338 --> 01:49:42.240
I've got a very important meeting in Rome.
I've got to get through.

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.160
- Bitch!
- Bastard!
