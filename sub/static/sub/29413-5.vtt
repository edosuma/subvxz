WEBVTT

00:13.013 --> 00:15.493
Greetings,
four-wheeled friends.

00:15.537 --> 00:18.409
Dave, do you ever just say "hi"?

00:18.453 --> 00:20.455
Oh. Nay.

00:21.412 --> 00:24.024
Look at you guys,
out for a bike ride.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.504
Yeah. Back in Kalamazoo,
we used to take family rides

00:26.548 --> 00:27.810
all the time.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.812
Not on Old Duck Lane, of course,

00:29.855 --> 00:31.770
with all the traffic.

00:31.814 --> 00:35.383
Well, around here, if
you see a grown man on a bike,

00:35.426 --> 00:38.777
his sidepiece
slashed his tires.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.388
What's a sidepiece?

00:41.432 --> 00:43.347
Oh, well,
it's when a guy...

00:43.391 --> 00:44.827
Dave!

00:44.870 --> 00:47.525
...gets an extra
piece of chicken.

00:48.787 --> 00:52.008
Cool! Then next time,
I'm gonna get a sidepiece.

00:54.445 --> 00:57.622
Well, I don't know about you,
but I sure worked up an appetite

00:57.666 --> 00:59.450
for our double date tonight.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.148
Double date?

01:01.191 --> 01:03.889
Who's the unlucky
couple?

01:04.934 --> 01:06.240
We are.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.677
What? Tina, I
thought you and I

01:08.720 --> 01:10.505
were going to The
Lobster Factory.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.551
Uh, we are, but the Johnsons
are coming with us,

01:13.595 --> 01:16.511
and we're not going
to The Lobster Factory.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.252
We're going to
this hip new place

01:18.295 --> 01:19.427
called Sprout and Jar.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.298
I've been dying
to try it.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.431
Everything's served
in mason jars.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.737
Except for the drinks,
which come to the table

01:25.781 --> 01:27.043
in a communal trough.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.264
Come on, Tina.

01:30.307 --> 01:32.266
Saturday is one
of my cheat days.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.398
I just want to go
to a classy place,

01:34.442 --> 01:36.487
where, you know,
I can put on a bib

01:36.531 --> 01:39.099
and suck butter
off my fingers.

01:39.142 --> 01:41.013
I know, baby.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.754
That's why we
didn't ask you.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.539
Mwah!

01:44.582 --> 01:45.583
Calvin, don't worry,

01:45.627 --> 01:47.890
Sprout and Jar has
a lobster dish.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.283
Oh. Okay.

01:49.326 --> 01:52.373
It's an aerated foam
served in a balloon.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.027
Sounds good, doesn't it?

01:55.071 --> 01:56.333
To use your words:

01:56.377 --> 01:57.639
Nay.

02:00.076 --> 02:01.991
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:02.034 --> 02:03.253
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.651
Ooh...

02:09.694 --> 02:12.523
Wow, this place
is really nice.
I know.

02:12.567 --> 02:15.047
Everything they serve here
is farm-to-table.

02:15.091 --> 02:17.528
Ooh. Well, as long as they
kill it somewhere in between,

02:17.572 --> 02:18.703
I'm good.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.012
Ooh, Calvin, check this out.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.232
The menus are printed
on rice paper.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.624
When you're done ordering,

02:26.668 --> 02:28.539
you can eat them
as an appetizer.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.106
I don't know.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.501
I-I don't want to
fill up on menu.

02:33.544 --> 02:35.459
Hey, babe...

02:35.503 --> 02:37.983
didn't this used to be
Alfreeda's check-cashing place?

02:38.027 --> 02:39.550
Yeah, until the
cops found out

02:39.594 --> 02:42.814
it was also Alfreeda's
drug-dealing place.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.860
You see?
Just another example

02:44.903 --> 02:49.212
of gentrification taking over
a fine, locally owned business.

02:50.648 --> 02:51.910
Greetings.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.652
Thank you for the opportunity
to nourish you.

02:55.523 --> 02:59.135
Doesn't anybody
just say "hi" anymore?

03:00.571 --> 03:02.225
We have a reservation
under Johnson.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.662
Oh. We prefer not to use
the term "reservation"

03:04.706 --> 03:07.230
out of respect
to Native Americans.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.581
Then how do we do this?

03:10.625 --> 03:13.454
We also prefer you don't use
the world "how."

03:16.413 --> 03:18.589
I'm sorry,
we're running a bit behind.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.417
It's gonna be
about an hour and a half.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.158
An hour and a half?

03:22.202 --> 03:27.119
How long does it take
to shove a lobster in a balloon?

03:27.163 --> 03:30.297
You know, that-that
is a long wait.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.037
Maybe we should go
someplace else.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.039
Well, I did just read
about a new soul food restaurant

03:34.083 --> 03:35.040
around the corner.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.346
Ooh, that sounds good.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.826
Gemma, are you
cool with that?

03:37.869 --> 03:39.741
I mean,
sure, it just took me

03:39.784 --> 03:41.699
six weeks to get
the reserva...

03:41.743 --> 03:43.745
table holding.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.617
Calvin, what do you say?

03:46.661 --> 03:51.579
Oh. So I guess you think
all black people want soul food.

03:51.622 --> 03:52.710
N...

03:52.754 --> 03:54.408
N-No. I'm sorry, I didn't...

03:54.451 --> 03:56.366
I'm just kidding with you, man.
Hell yeah, let's go.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.544
You know what?
I'm just gonna grab a menu

04:00.588 --> 04:02.242
for a little snack on the way.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.159
Hey, hey, party people!

04:07.203 --> 04:08.900
Yo, what's up, man?Hey.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.338
So, what's this school project
you need help on, Grover?

04:11.381 --> 04:13.122
Is it a report on
a foreign country?

04:13.165 --> 04:14.863
Because if it's
Madagascar,

04:14.906 --> 04:18.345
the capital is Antananarivo.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.651
Actually, I have to interview
people in my neighborhood,

04:20.695 --> 04:22.740
so I thought I'd do a podcast.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.481
Oh, your very own podcast.

04:24.525 --> 04:25.874
That's pretty cool, man.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.528
Yeah, you know,
it's not as cool

04:27.571 --> 04:30.444
as having a pen pal
in Antananarivo, but...

04:30.487 --> 04:32.315
Sit down.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.143
The podcast is called
Gabbin' with Grover.

04:34.186 --> 04:36.319
My dad helped me
with the theme song.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.103
Okay, well, let's do it, then.

04:38.147 --> 04:41.193
DAVE: ♪ Gabbin' with Grover,
Gabbin' with Grover ♪

04:41.237 --> 04:43.544
♪ Gabbin' our cares away

04:43.587 --> 04:45.894
♪ Ice cream or wizards,
kickball or lizards ♪

04:45.937 --> 04:48.331
♪ Whatever's on his mind today,
hey, hey. ♪

04:50.986 --> 04:54.381
It's catchy, it's catchy.It's nice, nice. Nice.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.296
There's three more verses.
Want to hear 'em?

04:56.339 --> 04:57.906
Hell no.Hell no.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.953
Okay, then let's start.

05:01.997 --> 05:05.130
Hey, Mrs. Sweeney
and the rest of room 14.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.915
Except Spencer.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.091
I heard about
your birthday party.

05:11.049 --> 05:13.356
So, I'd like to welcome
my first guests,

05:13.400 --> 05:14.792
Malcolm and Marty Butler.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.794
Hey, hey!
What's up, Mrs. Sweeney?

05:16.838 --> 05:18.579
Uh, hello, everyone,
except Spencer.

05:18.622 --> 05:21.190
Not cool, bro.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.671
Okay, let's start
with you, Marty.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.020
All right, you got it.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.674
What's on your
mind, little man?

05:26.717 --> 05:29.416
You have a really cool job,
you're super smart,

05:29.459 --> 05:30.678
and you dress nice.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.723
Thank you.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.551
So why don't you have
a girlfriend?

05:36.292 --> 05:38.207
Wha... What?

05:38.250 --> 05:39.339
You know...

05:39.382 --> 05:41.297
why don't girls like you?

05:47.738 --> 05:50.306
Well, well, uh, w-well...

05:50.350 --> 05:51.916
Uh, uh, uh,
answer the question, man.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.831
Room 14 wants to know.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.621
Now, this is
what I'm talkin' about.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.624
Got pictures of our people
on the wall,

06:03.667 --> 06:05.452
and it smells just like
my grandmama's kitchen.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.454
And did you hear
what the waitress said

06:07.497 --> 06:08.933
when we walked in?

06:08.977 --> 06:10.195
She said, "Hi."

06:11.849 --> 06:14.330
Which is more than what
Calvin's bitter old grandma

06:14.374 --> 06:15.636
ever said to me.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.768
Lord rest her soul.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.902
Let's see.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.513
Cracklin' Bread.
Hoppin' John.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.862
Ooh, hush puppies.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.864
I'm gonna get those.
They sound adorable.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.694
Mr. and Mrs. Butler!
How you folks doing?

06:30.738 --> 06:32.740
Hey.Hey, Daryl.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.959
I see you finally grew
into that head.

06:36.831 --> 06:37.788
How's your mama and them?

06:38.920 --> 06:39.834
Who's "Andem"?

06:39.877 --> 06:42.880
Oh. That's black for "er'body."

06:44.926 --> 06:46.754
Which is black for "everybody."

06:48.495 --> 06:50.801
So, does anyone have
any questions about the menu?

06:50.845 --> 06:51.802
I do.

06:51.846 --> 06:54.849
What exactly are
chitterlings?

06:57.895 --> 07:00.071
Dave, Dave,
Dave, we say

07:00.115 --> 07:01.464
"chitlins."

07:01.508 --> 07:02.857
It's boiled pig intestines.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.902
It's a black delicacy.

07:04.946 --> 07:08.471
Oh. I have trouble digesting
things that, you know...

07:08.515 --> 07:10.299
digest things.

07:11.692 --> 07:14.912
We just had vegan meat loaf
at your house last week.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.827
Consider this payback.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.137
And I had to sit...

07:22.180 --> 07:24.487
in that lost-and-found
for over an hour

07:24.531 --> 07:26.837
before my mama came and got me.

07:29.187 --> 07:32.190
Is it any surprise that I
have abandonment issues?!

07:33.757 --> 07:36.368
Can we please be done
with the interview?

07:36.412 --> 07:39.546
I stopped asking you questions,
like, ten minutes ago.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.726
So, let's move on to Malcolm.

07:45.769 --> 07:46.857
Oh, thank God.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.775
All right, bring on
the questions, G-man.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.517
Unlike my brother,
I've had a ton of girlfriends,

07:54.561 --> 07:57.128
I'm emotionally stable,
and I've never lost my swimsuit

07:57.172 --> 07:58.956
on a waterslide.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.176
Yeah, I didn't lose it.
You pulled it down.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.527
Okay, Malcolm.
You wanted to be

08:04.571 --> 08:07.356
a professional baseball player
before you got hurt, right?

08:07.399 --> 08:09.445
Uh, yeah, that's right.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.403
Are you that good
at anything else?

08:11.447 --> 08:13.710
And if not,
does that make you sad?

08:20.935 --> 08:22.545
Um...

08:22.589 --> 08:24.591
well, that's
a complicated question.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.027
It's okay. Take your time.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.815
Looks like he yanked
yourswimsuit down.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.865
Mm. Excuse me.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.084
I am smackin' so loud,
I'm embarrassed.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.087
I'm sorry, Grandmama,

08:43.131 --> 08:46.874
but somebody's giving your food
a run for its money.

08:48.397 --> 08:51.400
I think you're looking
in the wrong direction.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.490
Sweetie, are you okay?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.797
You're looking
a little sweaty.
Oh...

08:56.840 --> 08:59.713
it's the spice.

08:59.756 --> 09:03.847
Oh, my mouth has been numb
since that first hush puppy.

09:03.891 --> 09:07.503
Dave, what your white body
is reacting to

09:07.547 --> 09:10.854
is a thing
we like to call flavor.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.029
This is the food

09:12.073 --> 09:13.727
of our people--

09:13.770 --> 09:15.946
our blood, sweat and tears,

09:15.990 --> 09:19.820
400 years of resilience
in every dish.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.779
Oh, Lord, he's going
into preacher mode.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.738
It's pride on a plate.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.001
Soul in a bowl.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.046
Hot damn in the hot sauce!

09:31.048 --> 09:33.224
Hallelujah.Yeah, hallelujah.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.052
How's everyone doing here?

09:35.096 --> 09:37.228
I could use another glass
of ice water.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.058
Everything was amazing, Daryl.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.670
I mean, this food
really takes me back, man.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.497
Give my compliments to the chef.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.847
Why don't you tell him yourself?

09:46.890 --> 09:47.891
Chef Mitchell!

09:47.935 --> 09:48.979
Someone wants
to meet you.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.382
Thanks for coming
to my restaurant.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.818
How are we enjoying everything?

10:01.862 --> 10:03.820
Ah.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.214
I'm guessing he looks nothing
like your grandma.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.397
Whenever you're ready.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.662
Wow. These desserts are even
better than the main course.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.664
Yeah, the yellow cake
is great.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.100
Again...

10:23.144 --> 10:24.928
a little spicy, but...

10:26.538 --> 10:28.279
...but great.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.934
Well, baby, you haven't
touched your dessert.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.893
You know what?
You're right.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.069
There. I touched it.

10:36.940 --> 10:37.941
Oh, come on, Calvin.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.247
You were raving about the food

10:39.290 --> 10:40.988
before you found out
the chef was white.

10:41.031 --> 10:44.208
That's before he tricked me
into thinking it was delicious.

10:44.252 --> 10:48.691
Tina, this is a classic
example of appropriation:

10:48.735 --> 10:52.042
a white chef stealing
black cuisine.

10:52.086 --> 10:55.089
Stealing?
I wouldn't call it stealing.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.831
Uh, someone
who's not of my culture

10:57.874 --> 10:59.659
cooking my culture's food?

10:59.702 --> 11:02.705
You don't see me
making avocado toast.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.927
But isn't all cooking
kind of appropriation?

11:06.970 --> 11:09.538
I mean, I'm not Italian, but
I make spaghetti all the time.

11:09.581 --> 11:10.844
And I'm not Mexican, but...

11:10.887 --> 11:14.151
Please don't bring
Taco Tuesday into this.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.371
Oh, come on, Calvin.
We were having a good time.

11:16.414 --> 11:19.374
No, no. I-I am
sick and tired

11:19.417 --> 11:21.768
of black culture
being taken from us.

11:21.811 --> 11:22.943
I mean, our food,

11:22.986 --> 11:25.162
our music, our clothes.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.425
White people even tried
to take Tiger Woods

11:27.469 --> 11:29.210
and then tried to give him back!

11:32.779 --> 11:35.477
Calvin, I don't think the
chef is taking your food.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.739
I think he's
celebrating it.

11:36.783 --> 11:40.003
Like how I play the
maracas on Taco Tuesday.

11:40.047 --> 11:43.050
Look, I don't care
what you call it.

11:43.093 --> 11:46.357
I am done eating
this chef's food.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.708
It's a good thing I kept
a few bites of this menu.

12:00.458 --> 12:03.287
♪ Gabbin' with Grover,
Gabbin' with Grover ♪

12:03.331 --> 12:06.508
♪ Gabbin' our cares away.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.467
Dave, if you're writing me
another love song,

12:09.511 --> 12:10.904
just know

12:10.947 --> 12:13.341
it's gonna be tough to top
last week's.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.779
No. I've given up on that.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.128
Nothing rhymes with Gemma.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.347
It's a real problem.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.610
Some might call it a...

12:21.653 --> 12:23.568
dilemma.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.570
I mean, I guess.

12:27.442 --> 12:31.402
No, I'm-I'm rerecording the
theme song to Grover's podcast.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.013
Why?Well,

12:33.056 --> 12:36.320
I'm afraid that my rap version
is appropriating black culture.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.582
Which is a shame,

12:37.626 --> 12:39.193
because it was straight fire.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.284
I think you
may be overreacting a little.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.895
Well, maybe, but, you know,
I don't think it's up to us

12:45.939 --> 12:48.071
to decide what's offensive
and what's not.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.638
So what are you gonna do,

12:49.681 --> 12:52.641
just stop using things that
were invented by other cultures?

12:52.684 --> 12:55.209
'Cause I don't see you giving up
your nunchucks.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.125
I'm gonna make an exception
for those.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.127
It's a matter of home security.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.305
I just think
maybe Calvin has a point.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.437
Then why didn't it bother Tina?

13:06.481 --> 13:08.700
Well, maybe it did and
she just didn't say anything.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.616
Really, Dave?
I once saw her tell a librarian,

13:11.660 --> 13:13.096
"No, youkeep it down."

13:14.097 --> 13:15.272
Well,

13:15.316 --> 13:16.926
in the librarian's defense,

13:16.970 --> 13:19.407
that book was eight years
overdue.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.236
Dave, sharing different cultures
is a good thing.

13:22.279 --> 13:25.065
If we all just stuck to our own
little corners of the world,

13:25.108 --> 13:27.458
there'd be no tolerance,
no understanding,

13:27.502 --> 13:29.069
no progress.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.070
Okay.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.854
I see your point.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.466
Maybe I should just keep
rapping.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.121
How 'bout we ask Tina
about that?

13:42.386 --> 13:45.346
Are you watching Do the Right Thing?

13:45.389 --> 13:47.478
I sure am.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.959
Black actors
with a black director

13:50.003 --> 13:52.092
who made his first movie
on credit.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.050
Now, that's black.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.486
Oh, so I see.

13:55.530 --> 13:58.098
You're still worked up
about that chef being white.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.100
You're damn right I am.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.102
Why do you think
I'm eating potato chips--

14:02.145 --> 14:03.494
invented by a black man--

14:03.538 --> 14:05.279
dipping it in peanut butter--

14:05.322 --> 14:07.368
also made by a black man?

14:08.456 --> 14:11.241
Who knew
legacy could be so delicious?

14:12.329 --> 14:14.070
Oh, you don't have
to tell me.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.246
I used to eat that
when I was pregnant with Marty.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.379
Also made by a black man.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.077
Look, Calvin,

14:21.121 --> 14:22.209
you got to let this go.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.340
No. I can't.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.864
I-I've been thinking about this.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.126
And from now on,

14:26.169 --> 14:28.432
if it's not black-owned
or black-invented,

14:28.476 --> 14:30.260
we blackballing it.

14:30.304 --> 14:33.002
Calvin, baby, I respect
what you're trying to do,

14:33.046 --> 14:35.222
but you got to be
more realistic.No.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.485
No, what I got to do
is remind this community

14:37.528 --> 14:41.228
is that what we need to be doing
is investing in ourselves.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.882
All right. I'm all for that.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.232
But you lay one hand
on my Louis Vuitton bag,

14:45.275 --> 14:47.060
you coming back with a nub.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.324
I'm serious, Tina.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.108
I've been up all night thinking
about this,

14:52.152 --> 14:54.023
and I'm not taking this
laying down.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.590
All right. Fine.
What you gonna do?

14:55.633 --> 14:57.200
I'm gonna take a stand.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.201
All right.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.768
Right after I take a nap.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.206
That peanut butter
giving me the itis.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.863
MARTY:
Hey, man.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.213
I got your text. You don't want
to go to the bar tonight?

15:10.257 --> 15:11.388
Ah, what's the point, man?

15:11.432 --> 15:13.347
After gabbing with Grover,

15:13.390 --> 15:16.045
I can't stop thinking
about how depressing my life is.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.309
I'm starting to get
why Spencer didn't invite

15:19.353 --> 15:21.703
his little ass to his party.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.619
Yeah, man, that interview
really shook my confidence.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.621
I haven't felt this naked
and exposed since...

15:26.664 --> 15:29.406
since the waterslide.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.714
Hey, man, well, at least
you have a job that you love.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.803
Yeah, but I can't
go on dates with my job.

15:34.846 --> 15:38.938
My job can't give me a hug
after a long day at work.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.592
My job c-- Oh, no.
Here come the waterworks.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.986
Hey. Whoa, whoa,
dude, dude.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.205
Marty, you don't see me crying,

15:45.248 --> 15:46.597
and I'm in a worse spot
than you are.

15:46.641 --> 15:49.122
I was on track to be
a pro baseball player, man.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.385
Now I'm just a security guard.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.387
Yeah, but think
about it like this:

15:53.430 --> 15:56.390
most baseball players' careers
are over by the time they're 30.

15:56.433 --> 15:59.262
You could be a security guard
for the rest of your life, man.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.441
You are lucky
I'm too depressed to punch you.

16:04.485 --> 16:05.747
Look, look.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.575
Malcolm, I know
it's not your dream job,

16:07.618 --> 16:08.924
but that doesn't mean
you won't find it.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.839
It's just...
it's just a matter of time

16:10.882 --> 16:12.275
before things turn around.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.060
Yeah, I guess you're right, man.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.149
And don't worry.
You're gonna find somebody.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.803
The world is full of girls, man.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.675
One of 'em's got to like you.

16:22.764 --> 16:23.939
You think she's cute?

16:23.983 --> 16:24.940
Oh, yeah.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.463
You know, in a nerdy,

16:26.507 --> 16:28.117
comic book-loving,Ooh.

16:28.161 --> 16:31.773
headgear-wearing
type of way.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.340
Yeah, she sounds hot.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.039
You know what, man?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.693
We should go to that bar.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.347
Yeah. Maybe
my dream girl is there.

16:40.390 --> 16:43.959
Actually, my gut's telling me
she don't get out much.

16:47.789 --> 16:48.920
Hey. Lewis.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.705
I heard you're about to be
a grandfather.

16:50.748 --> 16:51.923
That's great.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.751
Chef's white.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.019
Mable?

17:00.062 --> 17:02.543
I ain't seen you
in a hot minute.

17:02.586 --> 17:03.761
Have you lost weight?

17:03.805 --> 17:05.807
Chef's white.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.202
Calvin?

17:10.768 --> 17:11.813
What are you doing here?

17:11.856 --> 17:13.641
I'm letting these people know

17:13.684 --> 17:15.251
before they spend
their black dollar

17:15.295 --> 17:18.167
that the chef's white.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.647
Really?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.649
Sabotaging this restaurant?

17:21.692 --> 17:23.216
I can't believe you.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.652
I can't believe you either.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.436
Anyone who cared about me

17:26.480 --> 17:29.744
would not support this business
or eat this food.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.920
All right, Gemma,
I'm ready to get my grub on...

17:33.356 --> 17:35.706
Tina? You, too?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.186
I told you, Calvin.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.448
This is your fight,
not mine.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.668
You know what,
I can't believe you two.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.844
I guess Dave is the only person
I can count on.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.368
Well, I got
my antacids and...Oh.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.852
Am I the only one who cares
what's happening around here?

17:50.895 --> 17:52.288
I mean,

17:52.332 --> 17:54.116
apparently,
if the food is good enough,

17:54.160 --> 17:56.858
you don't care
if our culture's stolen.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.339
You know what,

17:59.382 --> 18:01.471
Calvin makes a good point.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.951
It's not stolen.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.822
I read that the chef's
from Louisiana.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.086
His recipes go back
three generations.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.916
Can't argue with that.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.005
I don't care where he's from.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.790
He's just
another white dude

18:15.833 --> 18:18.358
moving into our community,
trying to be down.

18:18.401 --> 18:21.274
Doesn't get more wack
than that.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.802
Look, Calvin, we hear you,

18:27.845 --> 18:29.064
but what are
we supposed to do,

18:29.108 --> 18:31.066
stop going
to white-owned businesses?

18:31.110 --> 18:34.156
Oh. Now, I don't have anything
against white businesses.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.984
They take things back
without a receipt.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.508
So...Oh.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.251
So if you're not opposed
to white businesses,

18:42.295 --> 18:43.687
then what's the problem?

18:43.731 --> 18:45.124
The problem is

18:45.167 --> 18:47.691
is that other people
are profiting off our culture,

18:47.735 --> 18:49.998
when it should be us.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.478
Fine. I don't
see it that way.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.175
But for the sake
of our friendship,

18:53.219 --> 18:56.352
I'm willing to give up delicious
ham hocks and pigs' feet.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.789
Hey! Two nights
in a row.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.356
I'm glad our food's
got you coming back.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.011
Yeah, well, sorry, Daryl.
We're actually on our way out.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.882
Now, h-hold on, hold on.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.884
Can I ask you a question?

19:06.928 --> 19:09.670
Do you like working here?Yeah.

19:09.713 --> 19:10.932
Hmm.Well, wouldn't you rather

19:10.975 --> 19:12.890
be working for a black chef?

19:12.934 --> 19:15.371
That would be cool,
but Chef Mitchell's dope.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.068
He's teaching me a lot.

19:17.112 --> 19:20.028
What can he teach you about soul
food that your grandmama can't?

19:20.071 --> 19:21.551
It's not just about the food.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.684
You know, he's also teaching me
about the business.

19:23.727 --> 19:24.946
You never know, Mr. Butler.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.905
Someday, you could be rolling up
in my place.

19:27.949 --> 19:30.734
Mm.

19:30.778 --> 19:31.996
You hear that, Calvin?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.781
Yeah, I heard it.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.394
Well, it sounds to me
like this place

19:38.438 --> 19:41.397
is giving our people
pretty good opportunities.

19:41.441 --> 19:42.964
And the food is legit.

19:43.007 --> 19:44.748
I-I said I heard it.Okay.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.185
Okay.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.404
What do you say,
Calvin?

19:48.448 --> 19:49.710
It's your call.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.320
Well,

19:51.364 --> 19:53.017
I did work up a
pretty big appetite

19:53.061 --> 19:55.411
trying to shut
this place down.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.761
Okay. We'll take
a table for four.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.154
Great. You can
follow me.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.938
Thank you.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.592
Hey, uh, Calvin,
since...

20:02.636 --> 20:05.029
I paid last time,
tonight's on you?

20:05.073 --> 20:07.989
Well, I mean, chef's
white, you're white.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.904
Let's just keep
that going. Yeah.

20:18.652 --> 20:21.176
Thanks for letting me
interview you, Mr. Calvin.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.178
Oh, you got it,
little man.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.703
What I don't understand
is why you two want to be here.

20:28.183 --> 20:31.752
Oh. We just want to watch
you do your thing, Pop.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.103
Yeah, Dad. You know,
we just want to soak up

20:35.146 --> 20:37.061
some of that
fatherly wisdom.

20:38.976 --> 20:41.327
I am quite wise, aren't I?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.287
All right, Grover. Fire away.

20:45.331 --> 20:48.116
Okay, first question.

20:48.159 --> 20:51.598
You're funny and cool
and everyone looks up to you.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.252
Yeah, and...?

20:53.295 --> 20:55.993
Why didn't Malcolm and Marty
get any of that?

20:59.780 --> 21:01.434
How much time you got?
