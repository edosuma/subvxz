00:58.810 --> 01:00.843
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Mr. Ames.

01:00.878 --> 01:04.312
I was lancing a neck boil.
The patient was fidgety.

01:04.346 --> 01:06.346
Oh, I understand.

01:06.380 --> 01:10.447
So I've never used
a private detective before.

01:10.481 --> 01:12.881
That's all right.
Most of my clients are virgins.

01:12.916 --> 01:16.317
But I didn't tell you I was a virgin.
You're a very good detective.

01:16.351 --> 01:19.418
Oh, thank you, but I meant that
metaphorically, Dr. O'Connor.

01:19.452 --> 01:22.286
Oh.
Well...

01:22.321 --> 01:24.921
Part of the reason
I need your help

01:24.955 --> 01:26.588
is my virginity.

01:26.622 --> 01:28.822
What exactly do you
need done, doctor?

01:28.857 --> 01:30.823
I advertize on Craigslist,

01:30.858 --> 01:32.891
but I am not involved
in the sex trade.

01:32.925 --> 01:35.092
Sorry, that's not what I meant.

01:35.127 --> 01:39.261
Um, you see I've saved
myself for marriage.

01:39.295 --> 01:42.096
But my fiancee's family is against me.
They blocked all communication

01:42.130 --> 01:45.097
- so I need you to take a letter to her.
- Why are they against y?

01:45.132 --> 01:48.232
It's complicated, but one of the
reasons is because I'm Irish.

01:48.267 --> 01:51.300
Hmm, that's strange.
The Irish are usually very popular.

01:51.335 --> 01:53.902
I know.
It's odd.

01:53.936 --> 01:56.736
Anyway, please deliver
this letter to her

01:56.771 --> 01:59.805
at the Korean spa in Queens...
The Castle, do you know it?

01:59.839 --> 02:02.239
Yes, I've heard it's very
good for birthday parties.

02:02.274 --> 02:04.941
So your fiancee's name is Hee?

02:04.975 --> 02:07.042
Yes, it's a common Korean name.

02:07.076 --> 02:10.610
Her father actually owns The Castle,
but it's our best chance to reach her.

02:12.046 --> 02:14.046
I love her very much.

02:15.281 --> 02:17.948
Okay.
Your letter will be delivered.

02:17.982 --> 02:20.416
Thank you.
It's very important.

02:20.450 --> 02:23.885
A ship leaving tomorrow night needs a
doctor and I've taken the position.

02:23.919 --> 02:26.253
- Where is the boat going?
- Argentina.

02:26.287 --> 02:28.788
We'll start a new life there.

02:28.822 --> 02:31.190
Argentina has a high
rate of skin cancer.

02:31.224 --> 02:33.325
It's very good
for dermatologists.

02:33.359 --> 02:35.927
- Hmmm.
- Speaking of cancer...

02:37.129 --> 02:39.529
That is a very big mole.

02:39.564 --> 02:41.964
I think we should do
a quick biopsy.

02:41.999 --> 02:44.299
I won't remove the whole thing.
Just a sliver.

02:44.334 --> 02:46.501
What? I'm very
attached to this mole.

02:48.070 --> 02:49.270
Ow ow.

02:52.874 --> 02:55.877
I appreciate all of you writing
these sealed testimonials.

02:55.912 --> 02:59.580
If I get the Midwood college job,
I've got you guys to thank.

02:59.615 --> 03:01.416
You're welcome, Professor Ames.

03:01.450 --> 03:05.386
Okay. So I thought we'd start
tonight with an exercise...

03:05.421 --> 03:07.989
Wait. Did you read
this week's "New Yorker"?

03:08.023 --> 03:10.491
They announced the winner
for the contest.

03:10.525 --> 03:13.160
What? Already?
Did I... Who... who won?

03:13.196 --> 03:15.029
Nobody from
our great class won.

03:15.063 --> 03:16.864
Someone named Louis Greene won.

03:16.898 --> 03:19.666
Oh no, not Greene.

03:19.701 --> 03:21.401
Can I see that?
I know him.

03:21.436 --> 03:24.405
It's an amazing story.

03:24.439 --> 03:25.940
<i>I read it on the subway.</i>

03:25.974 --> 03:28.042
It's really funny and sexy.

03:28.076 --> 03:29.677
Don't...
don't say that, Nina.

03:32.247 --> 03:34.647
"I knew a failed writer
who was mentally

03:34.681 --> 03:36.315
and emotionally unstable.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.183
He believed that he was a...

03:38.218 --> 03:40.752
Private detective.

03:40.786 --> 03:43.987
His skull was oddly pinched
at the top."

03:44.021 --> 03:46.456
Oh my God.

03:48.225 --> 03:50.626
His story is about me.

03:56.265 --> 03:58.132
Jonathan.

03:58.167 --> 04:01.536
You seemed so upset about the story,
I thought I'd come check on you.

04:01.570 --> 04:04.004
Yeah.

04:04.038 --> 04:06.373
What's weird is
he wrote about me

04:06.407 --> 04:08.275
and I wrote about him,

04:08.309 --> 04:11.176
except in my story I turned
him into a femme fatale.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.611
A blonde.

04:12.645 --> 04:16.581
I'd like to be a blonde femme
fatale in one of your stories.

04:30.026 --> 04:32.126
I know we just had
our first kiss and all,

04:32.161 --> 04:34.195
um, but, um...

04:34.229 --> 04:36.931
Could we do some role-play?

04:36.965 --> 04:39.100
Role-playing?

04:39.134 --> 04:41.034
Well, I guess.

04:41.068 --> 04:45.271
Well, ever since I read "the
story of o" when I was 13,

04:45.305 --> 04:47.506
I've really wanted
to be spanked

04:47.540 --> 04:50.709
and chastised by a teacher
in a classroom.

04:52.311 --> 04:54.612
- By a teacher like me?
- Yes.

04:54.647 --> 04:57.716
Get behind your desk.
Make it authentic.

04:58.851 --> 05:00.652
Okay.

05:00.687 --> 05:03.088
I do have some experience
with spanking.

05:03.123 --> 05:05.257
Do you want a safety word or...

05:05.292 --> 05:07.093
I won't need one.

05:12.995 --> 05:16.530
Um, you wanted to see me,
Mr. Ames?

05:16.565 --> 05:19.333
Yes, my student.

05:19.367 --> 05:22.535
I notice that you're always
drifting off in class. I...

05:25.038 --> 05:27.106
So now you
want me to spank you?

05:27.140 --> 05:29.708
- Don't break character!
- All right, sorry.

05:32.344 --> 05:34.612
Harder.
Harder.

05:36.948 --> 05:38.849
Harder!
Harder.

05:38.883 --> 05:40.483
- Like that?
- Yes!

05:40.517 --> 05:43.486
You're very bad at math.
Your homework is late.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.221
Your spelling is awful.
You're a bad girl.

05:46.256 --> 05:47.990
A bad girl, a bad gir...

05:48.958 --> 05:50.692
I got to lock the school up.

05:50.727 --> 05:52.727
Right, um...

05:52.762 --> 05:55.597
Well, we're almost done in
here and we'll be right out.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.202
Oh my God.

06:01.237 --> 06:03.972
- How embarrassing.
- That wasn't embarrassing.

06:04.006 --> 06:06.708
It was just, you know...
too bad he came in.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.411
Well, would you like to go back
to my place and keep going?

06:10.446 --> 06:12.347
Oh no.

06:12.381 --> 06:14.215
I don't feel ready.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.083
Let's take it slow.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.455
I'll see you next week.

06:30.031 --> 06:32.365
This is a disaster.
I cannot use these letters.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.168
The writing is horrible.
I'll seem like a lousy teacher.

06:35.202 --> 06:36.569
This one is well written,

06:36.603 --> 06:39.004
but it says you make
all the girls in class wet.

06:39.039 --> 06:41.073
Oh yeah, that must
be from Nina.

06:41.107 --> 06:44.243
You know, something started
up with her last night.

06:44.277 --> 06:46.779
She has a teacher fantasy
and so I spanked her.

06:46.813 --> 06:49.916
Good, good for you.
Is that that little blonde minx?

06:49.950 --> 06:52.652
Yeah. She helped me forget about
"The New Yorker" contest.

06:52.686 --> 06:54.821
I'm sorry that jerkoff
Greene beat you out.

06:54.855 --> 06:58.191
Aw, that's all right. I'll just keep
writing my Harry Parker mysteries.

06:58.225 --> 07:00.860
I'm not going to let some sociopath
like Greene get me down.

07:00.894 --> 07:02.794
We have got to watch out
for nuts like that.

07:02.829 --> 07:05.030
A sociopath sent me
three hate letters this week.

07:05.064 --> 07:08.066
<i>- - Oh, must be George.</i>

07:08.100 --> 07:10.801
Let's go to the Castle,
birthday boy.

07:10.836 --> 07:13.504
So who do you think
sent you these letters?

07:13.538 --> 07:17.374
Uh, some anonymous jerk
who's jealous of my success.

07:17.408 --> 07:19.208
It might be my dad.

07:19.243 --> 07:21.010
Or it could be my sister;

07:21.044 --> 07:23.178
<i>my little cousin
Douglas.</i>

07:25.147 --> 07:27.047
Ah, Ray, Happy birthday.

07:27.082 --> 07:29.850
Oh, you shouldn't have,
but I'm glad you did.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.987
Well, shall we go to
the spa and get healthy?

07:33.021 --> 07:34.821
We can drink that afterward

07:34.855 --> 07:37.289
and undo everything...
detox and then retox.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.992
- You guys know each other, right?
- Hello, Vikram.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.862
- Hello, Mr. Jonathan. - Vikram, this
is my friend Ray. Ray, this is Vikram.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.364
Hello, Mr. Ray.
I read your comic. I loved it.

07:45.399 --> 07:46.965
Oh, thank you.

07:46.999 --> 07:50.802
I nearly lost my wife, so I identified
with the book quite strongly.

07:50.836 --> 07:53.904
I think you drew too many penises,
but I still enjoyed it.

07:53.939 --> 07:55.639
Yeah, come on, come on,
come on.

07:55.673 --> 07:59.942
- Not that many penises. - Hey,
I'm very excited about this Castle place.

07:59.976 --> 08:03.812
<i>- I read on the Internet that they have
wasabi bodyrubs. -</i>

08:03.846 --> 08:07.081
I love Sushi.
What's the matter?

08:07.115 --> 08:09.250
I told you the car needed a tune-up,
Mr. Christopher,

08:09.284 --> 08:12.353
- but you always procrastinate.
- Why are you always picking on me?

08:12.387 --> 08:14.955
I don't procrastinate.
I just like to do things later.

08:14.989 --> 08:17.757
- George, when did you get a driver?
- I started a few weeks ago.

08:17.791 --> 08:20.090
It's a wonderful job, but I
still want health insurance.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.995
<i>One thing at a time.</i>

08:23.029 --> 08:25.730
- Oh, well done, Vikram.
- Thank you, boss.

08:25.764 --> 08:28.599

08:28.634 --> 08:31.903

08:43.246 --> 08:45.414
You know, I'm not really shy,

08:45.448 --> 08:47.649
but I am glad there's
a robe option.

08:47.683 --> 08:50.218
Yeah, I didn't know this
place was divided by gender.

08:50.252 --> 08:52.520
At the Russian baths
in Manhattan it's coed.

08:52.554 --> 08:54.955
Yeah, this is a real
Asian sausage factory.

08:54.990 --> 08:56.824
Really?
It's not just a spa?

08:56.858 --> 08:59.626
You know something?
I've never had an Asian sausage.

08:59.660 --> 09:01.795
I bet they're spicy.
I'd like to try one.

09:01.829 --> 09:04.030
Are you sure you're
the editor of a magazine?

09:04.064 --> 09:06.500
- Yeah.
- So listen, guys,

09:06.534 --> 09:10.072
I have us scheduled
for a massage at 5:30.

09:10.106 --> 09:13.675
But first I have to deliver
a letter for a client.

09:13.710 --> 09:15.811
Wait, you're on a case
on my birthday?

09:15.845 --> 09:18.514
No, it's just a simple delivery
of a letter, Ray. Nothing big.

09:18.548 --> 09:21.183
- So that's why you wanted to come here?
- No, I...

09:21.218 --> 09:23.285
I heard this place was
good for birthdays

09:23.319 --> 09:25.920
and I thought I'd kill
two birds with o stone.

09:27.423 --> 09:29.791
You know, that wasn't
very sensitive, Jonathan.

09:29.825 --> 09:33.061
That's the kind of thing I used
to do to Priscilla all the time

09:33.095 --> 09:36.197
and it would infuriate her...
hidden motives and all that.

09:36.231 --> 09:38.900
- I'm not Priscilla!
- I know, I know.

09:38.934 --> 09:41.269
I'm sorry, Ray.
To be honest,

09:41.303 --> 09:44.805
I forgot about your birthday and I
thought this was a good compromise.

09:44.839 --> 09:48.575
It'll just take me two minutes and I'll
be right back with you guys, okay?

09:50.045 --> 09:53.280
- Okay.
- He said okay.

09:56.785 --> 10:00.888
Hey, you want to get stoned
before the massage?

10:00.922 --> 10:03.991
That would make me feel
a little bit better, yeah.

10:04.025 --> 10:05.859
Of course I do.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.301
Oh!

10:14.335 --> 10:15.602
Excuse me, hi.

10:15.637 --> 10:18.338
- Do you know Hee Cho?
- No.

10:18.373 --> 10:20.273
Well...

10:21.376 --> 10:22.976
Oh.

11:01.814 --> 11:03.147
Excuse me.

11:03.181 --> 11:07.817
Oh hi. Do you know
someone named Hee Cho?

11:09.186 --> 11:11.086
Bye.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.768
This is for women only!

11:26.803 --> 11:29.237
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.675
You know, I was pretending
that I was Tony Curtis.

11:32.709 --> 11:35.344
Listen, do you know
someone named Hee Cho?

11:35.378 --> 11:38.280
I have a letter for her.
It's very important.

11:38.314 --> 11:42.484
You!
You wait here, stupid boy.

11:54.831 --> 11:57.432
Oh boy, look at her.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.600
I'm so glad
the sun deck is coed.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.869
Hello.
And goodbye.

12:01.903 --> 12:03.837
Never see you again.

12:03.872 --> 12:07.207
Hey, Jonathan told me you're
quite the ladies' man nowadays.

12:07.242 --> 12:08.708
That's right.

12:08.743 --> 12:11.511
I've been with two women since
Leah broke up with me...

12:11.545 --> 12:15.615
A drunk and an elf...
both excellent in bed.

12:15.649 --> 12:18.084
An elf?
You mean a dwarf?

12:18.118 --> 12:21.720
No, an elf.
Every day she glued on elf ears.

12:21.754 --> 12:24.589
Nice... nice kid,
but she just kind of left

12:24.623 --> 12:27.124
and went back to Providence
to live with her parents.

12:27.159 --> 12:29.459
- Aw, that's a shame.
- No, it's okay.

12:29.493 --> 12:32.028
I'm trying to win Leah back.

12:32.062 --> 12:35.231
I saved her dog little Ray, so I
think that's a good first step.

12:35.265 --> 12:37.866
Oh my God, look at her.

12:37.901 --> 12:40.736
Ah ha ha ha.

12:40.770 --> 12:43.538
Ugh.

12:43.573 --> 12:45.440
Yeah.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.641
George, how many women
have you been with?

12:50.011 --> 12:52.979
Well, too many to count really.

12:54.648 --> 12:58.216
But it's been wonderful
in its own way.

12:58.251 --> 13:01.286
I've been like
Blanche Dubois really.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.288
I've relied on
the kindness of strangers.

13:06.324 --> 13:08.425
Hello.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.928
And goodbye.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.403
Excuse me,
I was told you have let.

13:20.437 --> 13:22.305
Why are you dressed like that?

13:22.339 --> 13:25.275
It's complicated.
Can you bring me to her?

13:25.309 --> 13:27.844
No, but I can deliver
the letter for you.

13:27.879 --> 13:30.580
I'm the only person at the
spa who really knows her.

13:30.615 --> 13:32.949
The note is
from Dr. O'Connor?

13:32.984 --> 13:35.752
Maybe.
Maybe not.

13:35.786 --> 13:38.788
Well, if it's from Dr.
O'Connor, she'll want the letter.

13:38.823 --> 13:41.224
I'm r friend.

13:44.428 --> 13:47.230
Okay, but it's really
important that she get this.

13:47.265 --> 13:50.066
I understand.

13:50.101 --> 13:52.168
It's a matter of the heart.

13:57.541 --> 13:58.875
Oh God.

13:58.909 --> 14:00.743
Oh, I love this.

14:00.777 --> 14:02.745
You know, being cancer-free

14:02.746 --> 14:05.681
has me craving all sorts
of new experiences

14:05.716 --> 14:09.018
- it's always like that.
- I guess it's heightened now.

14:09.052 --> 14:11.553
I want to try everything.
I want to be insane

14:11.588 --> 14:14.490
like Klaus Kinski.
I wanna... I wanna

14:14.524 --> 14:16.792
live in Stockholm in the winter

14:16.826 --> 14:20.062
because I've fallen in love.
I wanna be a eunuch

14:20.096 --> 14:23.032
in the harem of an Arab prince.

14:23.066 --> 14:26.068
- George, what are you talking about?
- We smoked pot on the roof.

14:26.102 --> 14:27.669
- Yeah.
- Oh.

14:27.704 --> 14:31.807
- I want to go to Stockholm.
- Oh yeah.

14:31.841 --> 14:35.144
Oh, that's the stuff!
Can you knead my buttocks with your toes?

14:35.178 --> 14:38.213
- That's where I hold a lot of tension.
- Yes sir.

14:40.416 --> 14:43.684
- I need to speak with you.
- Hee?

14:43.718 --> 14:46.286
<i>- You're the boy I gave the letter to?
- Yes.</i>

14:46.320 --> 14:47.754
- What?
- I need your help.

14:47.788 --> 14:50.055
My father's security guards
are after me.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.358
- Why, what happened?
- I took $10,000 from the safe for my dowry.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.594
<i>I love to shop.</i>

14:55.629 --> 14:57.430
That's them.
It's too late.

14:57.465 --> 14:59.232
Quick, hi under the table!

14:59.267 --> 15:01.570
Guys, guys, guys,
hide her, hide her.

15:01.604 --> 15:03.772
Cover her with your legs.
Cover her with your legs.

15:03.807 --> 15:07.174
- Come on, come on.
Sonny, don't say anything. - Okay.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.881
Okay okay.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.954
What the hell is going on?
This is my birthday.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.690
Oh, wait a minute.

15:26.724 --> 15:29.025
Is she for me?

15:31.461 --> 15:34.829
I can't believe this. I was really
enjoying having that woman walk on my ass.

15:34.864 --> 15:37.265
Sorry, Ray, but we have to help Hee.
She's all alone.

15:37.299 --> 15:40.767
This is fun too, right?
It'll make a great Harry Parker mystery.

15:40.801 --> 15:43.136
You could make things up.
It's called fiction.

15:43.171 --> 15:46.039
Now who exactly is Hee?

15:46.073 --> 15:49.309
My client's fiancee who is a man,
but also a beautiful woman.

15:49.343 --> 15:52.511
- So Hee is a he, but also a she?
- Yes.

15:52.546 --> 15:53.880
Got it.
Oh, I like this.

15:53.914 --> 15:56.282
It's very helpful for my mind.

15:56.316 --> 16:00.119
These sorts of things are supposed to be
very good for preventing Alzheimer's.

16:00.153 --> 16:02.154
You went down
the wrong hallway.

16:02.189 --> 16:03.889
The laundry room
is back that way.

16:03.923 --> 16:06.491
Oh!

16:06.526 --> 16:08.560
- Oh shit.
- Go go go!

16:08.594 --> 16:10.328
- Go go go go go!
- This way, this way.

16:10.363 --> 16:11.897
Here here.

16:11.931 --> 16:14.666
There's an emergency exit
we can use.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.968
Here here, jump jump jump.

16:27.646 --> 16:30.315
Oh, this is wonderful.

16:31.649 --> 16:33.617
Go go go go go go go!

16:33.651 --> 16:35.485
Vikram, Vikram, start the car.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.555
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

16:38.589 --> 16:40.290
Get in, go go go.

17:15.227 --> 17:18.796
<i>- - I told you the car
needed a tune-up, Mr. Christopher.</i>

17:18.829 --> 17:21.965
- Oh, stop nagging me!
- I agree with Vikram. This car sucks.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.534
Everyone shut up.
We'll wait till the car cools down.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.935
<i>I'll just let them have me.</i>

17:26.971 --> 17:28.638
Oh no, there they are.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.577
Shit, let's go!

17:50.695 --> 17:52.529
Wait wait wait for me.

17:52.564 --> 17:55.065
- Here here.
- Wait... Oh jeez.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.434
Ow ow ow ow.
God, I can't go any further.

17:57.469 --> 17:59.937
- Shhh.
- My knees are like frozen with arthritis.

17:59.971 --> 18:03.540
Down down.

18:03.574 --> 18:06.543
Vikram, you know martial arts.

18:06.578 --> 18:10.147
- Can you take these guys out? - Mr.
Christopher, I'm Indian, not Chinese.

18:10.181 --> 18:12.683
I can lower my body temperature,
but I don't know how to fight.

18:12.717 --> 18:16.086
That's not going to do us any good.
What about Indian wrestling?

18:16.120 --> 18:18.522
Mr. Christopher, you keep this up,
I'm going to resign my position.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.090
Oh lighten up.
Take a joke.

18:21.993 --> 18:24.027
Guys, I've got an idea.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.230
I don't know what's happening.

18:27.265 --> 18:29.966
What exactly is your
family's problem with you?

18:30.001 --> 18:32.736
They love me,
but they're ashamed of me.

18:32.770 --> 18:35.272
They're very traditional
and want me to be a boy.

18:35.306 --> 18:38.341
- That does sound traditional.
- So I'm eloping.

18:38.376 --> 18:40.643
I landed a doctor.

18:40.678 --> 18:43.980
- Are you married?
- No, I'm a cartoonist.

18:44.014 --> 18:46.549
You're very handsome.
I like your beard.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.852
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Thank you.

18:48.886 --> 18:50.653
I did, but she
broke up with me.

18:50.688 --> 18:53.589
But I still love her.
I regard her as my best friend.

18:55.326 --> 18:57.894
You know, I never thought I'd
be in a graveyard in a spa robe

18:57.928 --> 19:00.596
talking to a beautiful
transvestite in the moonlight.

19:00.630 --> 19:02.931
That's romantic.

19:05.335 --> 19:08.905
Hey, I'm over here!
I have the money!

19:08.939 --> 19:10.573
<i>- Whoo!
- Oh my God,</i>

19:10.608 --> 19:12.942
I can't believe he's
trying to be a hero again.

19:12.977 --> 19:15.912
I got the money, whoo!

19:17.181 --> 19:18.982
Jonathan, he's got a gun!

19:19.016 --> 19:20.950
Look out.

19:27.225 --> 19:29.426
Oh for God's sake,
put your back into it, man.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.196
Don't be so condescending,
Mr. Christopher.

19:32.230 --> 19:34.998
Ray, are you all right?!

19:37.736 --> 19:39.671
Is Hee Cho okay?

19:53.052 --> 19:55.820
- I love you.
- I love you, my dear.

19:58.256 --> 20:00.223
I'm feeling very emotional.

20:00.258 --> 20:03.560
- Me too, Vikram.
- I'm hungry. Is that an emotion?

20:03.594 --> 20:05.529
Sometimes.

20:07.398 --> 20:09.165
Thank you for everything.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.135
You're welcome, but there's
one more thing, Dr. O'Connor.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.639
As your private detective I should
tell you in case you don't know,

20:15.673 --> 20:17.874
- that Hee is...
- I know.

20:17.908 --> 20:19.542
She's perfect.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.146
Huh.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.758
Oh shit.
Wait wait!

20:33.792 --> 20:35.559
What about my biopsy?

20:35.593 --> 20:38.494
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Your biopsy was...

20:38.529 --> 20:41.530
What?

20:41.564 --> 20:43.865
- I...
- Don't worry.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.100
I know a very
good dermatologist.

20:46.135 --> 20:48.803
Much better than my urologist.

20:48.837 --> 20:50.938
What now, gentlemen?

20:50.972 --> 20:55.175
Well, we could go back to my
hotel and order room service.

20:55.209 --> 20:57.977
- It's still your birthday.
- What about that bottle of whiskey?

20:58.011 --> 21:00.846
- Maybe smoke a little birthday pot?
- Oooh.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.447
Is it presumptuous
of me to wish

21:02.482 --> 21:04.683
to join all of you after
our shared adventure?

21:04.717 --> 21:06.351
Not at all, Vikram.

21:06.385 --> 21:08.719
In the end you did very nicely
with that shovel.

21:08.754 --> 21:10.020
Thank you, boss.
