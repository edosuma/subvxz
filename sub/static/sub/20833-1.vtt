00:37.700 --> 00:42.200
THE FOLLOWING IS BASED
ON A TRUE STORY

02:11.800 --> 02:14.700
Excuse me, sir.
You've come in the wrong way.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.100
I'm sorry.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.700
This is the old entrance.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.500
The visitor's center's
back out and left..

02:20.900 --> 02:23.700
All right... I'll
wander over there.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.200
Well worth it. Been through
some amazing times.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.300
<i>This nation should</i>
<i>commit itself...</i>

02:46.600 --> 02:50.500
<i>to achieving the goal,</i>
<i>before this decade is out...</i>.

02:50.900 --> 02:54.700
<i>of landing a man on the moon</i>
<i>and returning him safely.</i>

02:58.700 --> 03:00.400
<i>Liftoff. The clock is running.</i>

03:12.200 --> 03:13.700
<i>Godspeed, John Glenn.</i>

03:19.000 --> 03:20.400
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

03:22.100 --> 03:25.900
<i>To go to the moon in this decade</i>
<i>and do the other things...</i>

03:27.000 --> 03:30.500
<i>not because they are easy,</i>
<i>but because they are hard</i>.

03:34.100 --> 03:37.400
<i>Liftoff. Go control</i>

03:44.500 --> 03:47.700
<i>Tminus 1 minute,</i>
<i>35 seconds and counting.</i>

03:48.000 --> 03:49.300
<i>Ignition sequence start</i>

03:55.400 --> 03:57.000
<i>Tower clear.</i>

03:57.300 --> 03:58.800
<i>Apollo 9, you're go all the way</i>.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.300
<i>Apollo 10, your trajectory</i>
<i>and guidance are go.</i>

04:02.800 --> 04:05.600
<i>Man is about to launch himself</i>
<i>on a trip to the moon.</i>

04:05.900 --> 04:07.200
<i>Neil Armstrong.</i>

04:07.600 --> 04:09.100
<i>Edwin "Buzz'</i>'<i>Aldrin.</i>

04:09.400 --> 04:10.700
<i>Michael Collins.</i>

04:10.800 --> 04:12.700
<i>Next stop for them, the moon.</i>

04:13.100 --> 04:15.800
<i>The lunar age is about to begin.</i>

04:24.600 --> 04:27.000
When the guy counts down...

04:27.300 --> 04:30.000
the 3 astronauts will take off
in Apollo 11 for America.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.900
The rocket will fly to the moon...

04:34.700 --> 04:35.800
Landing module.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.300
Landing module comes off
and lands.

04:38.700 --> 04:43.200
The astronauts come out and get
shot my Martians with lasers!

04:43.700 --> 04:45.300
- Damien.
- And their heads explode!

04:45.600 --> 04:47.600
They they'll fly to
Earth and kill us!

04:48.000 --> 04:48.800
That won't happen.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.300
It might.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.000
Next? Graeme.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.200
Just a minute, Graeme.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.100
- Melanie?
- I haven't done the moon landing.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.600
Thank God.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.200
I've made a model of the
telescope and dish in Parkes.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.900
When Neil Armstrong lands
on the moon...

05:06.300 --> 05:09.300
the world will be watching
television pictures...

05:09.700 --> 05:11.600
from the radio telescope in Parkes.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.400
Mr. Callen, the prime minister
wants to see you.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.400
- Can it wait?
- I don't think so.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.800
What's it about?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.200
He just got off the phone
to the White House.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.100
- Do you know who just phoned?
- No, sir.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.300
The President of the U.S.A., Nixon.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.600
I wasn't aware...

05:32.000 --> 05:34.400
Thanking me for allowing NASA
to use our facility.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.300
And something about an upgrade?

05:36.600 --> 05:38.100
What was he talking about?

05:38.300 --> 05:41.300
- There was a briefing...
- I don't read those bloody things.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.100
- Are we raising this in the House?
- We should.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.000
- What's this all about?
- Nixon referred to our telescope.

05:50.300 --> 05:53.400
NASA requested its use
in the Apollo program...

05:53.700 --> 05:55.400
originally as a backup receiver.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.000
- Originally?
- They upgraded its role.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.700
When Apollo 11 gets to the moon,
Parkes is the receiving station.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.300
- Meaning?
- We've got the moonwalk.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.800
The people at this place
know what they're doing?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.200
- I believe so.
- Bloody well hope so.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.600
Why'd they pick us?

06:12.900 --> 06:15.600
It's the largest in the
Southern Hemisphere.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.800
What's it doing in the middle
of sheep paddock?

06:26.700 --> 06:30.400
<i>The Parkes telescope, or as</i>
<i>we call it, the Dish...</i>.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.300
<i>will track Apollo 11's journey...</i>.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.900
<i>gathering astronauts'signals,</i>
<i>telemetry from the spaceship...</i>

06:37.300 --> 06:41.800
<i>and most important, the TV</i>
<i>signals from the moon itself.</i>

06:42.300 --> 06:44.900
<i>It</i>'<i>s 210 feet in diameter,</i>
<i>weighs 1,000 tons.</i>...

06:45.200 --> 06:49.700
<i>and</i> c <i>an point in al directions.</i>
<i>The most powerful in the world.</i>

06:50.800 --> 06:54.300
Can I have their full names
and specific roles?

06:54.900 --> 06:58.500
This is Ross Mitchell, responsible
for maneuvering the Dish.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.100
Glenn Latham, in charge
of the electronics.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.000
Glenn's a Sagittarius.
He enjoys knitting...

07:05.300 --> 07:07.200
Mitch, don't write that.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.200
From NASA, Al Burnett.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.900
Al's here to get all signals
to mission control.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.200
Enjoying your stay
in Australia, Al?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.300
Very much.
The people are warm...

07:16.500 --> 07:17.800
Great.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.500
You, Cliff, what's your
official title?

07:20.800 --> 07:23.300
Cliff Buxton, director.

07:23.700 --> 07:24.700
Or the Dishmaster.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.900
Now I'll add a few
personal details.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.200
- Married?
- Yeah.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.600
- Glenn?
- Fiancé, Janice Kellerman.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.200
She's not. I don't have one.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.100
Married. Two boys in Houston.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.800
And you, Cliff?

07:40.900 --> 07:41.800
Married.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.700
And just finally...

07:44.000 --> 07:45.900
I mean, no offense, but...

07:46.200 --> 07:50.000
the Americans spent 10 years,
billions of dollars...

07:50.400 --> 07:54.000
to watch man walk on the moon,
and it falls to you blokes.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
How do you feel about that?

08:00.300 --> 08:01.700
Much better before you
opened your trap.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.500
We feel confident that we have the
expertise to complete our role.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.700
But, Cliff...

08:09.100 --> 08:11.200
it's amazing, isn't it?

08:14.600 --> 08:16.000
Yes, it is amazing.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.000
And so Australia becomes a vital
cog in this grand endeavor.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.200
Early this morning...

08:23.500 --> 08:27.100
I conveyed to President Nixon
my long-term interest...

08:27.500 --> 08:30.500
and commitment to this project.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.600
It will be one of the
proudest moments...

08:33.900 --> 08:36.600
in Australia's scientific history.

08:38.200 --> 08:42.200
And I've accepted the invitation
of the mayor of Parkes...

08:42.600 --> 08:46.300
to be there on Monday
and witness firsthand...

08:46.700 --> 08:49.400
our vital contribution.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.900
That is an R.S.V.P.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.600
The prime minister
coming to Parkes.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.800
- I'll frame that.
- It's icing on the cake.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.200
- Know why this means so much?
- It helps your political career.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.900
- No, Len.
- Oh, it doesn't, yeah.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.200
The PM with the candidate.
Brown-nosing.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.500
- Licking arse.
- No.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.100
It's a vindication.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.300
Oh, a vindication.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.900
Of my campaign to get that
dish here in the first place.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.700
That was an episode.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.300
You know what people said
when I proposed Parkes?

09:21.700 --> 09:25.000
You were grandstanding, it was a
stunt to big-note yourself.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
Who said that?

09:30.500 --> 09:32.200
They said I was a dreamer.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.500
A visionary.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.300
Yeah, that's right.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.700
"Bob Mclntyre, you'll
never pull it off."

09:39.000 --> 09:40.200
And now...

09:40.800 --> 09:44.000
which town is part of
the Apollo 11 mission?

09:44.800 --> 09:46.700
<i>Honeysuckle network, Net Two.</i>

09:47.800 --> 09:50.200
<i>Confirm Parkes is up</i>
<i>and configured.</i>

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
<i>As Apollo 11's readied</i>
<i>for launch...</i>

09:52.900 --> 09:56.600
<i>NASA is completing fibal checks</i>
<i>on its deep spa</i> c <i>e network:</i>

09:57.000 --> 10:00.700
<i>The vast array of telescopes</i>
<i>and cable links...</i>

10:01.200 --> 10:03.000
<i>including a number</i>
<i>in Australia...</i>

10:03.300 --> 10:06.800
<i>with Apollo 11 on its</i>
<i>historic journey.</i>

10:07.200 --> 10:09.800
The repeaters will send
signals to Sydney.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.900
They strip the TV and
send it to Moree.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.300
Both receivers.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.500
Sorry. Go on.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.800
The rest will go to a demodulator
at Honeysuckle Creek.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.500
Can the telemetry feeds be
sent on separate lines?

10:22.700 --> 10:23.600
Mitch?

10:23.900 --> 10:25.000
Yeah, no problem.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.800
Separate lines.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.400
That's a big book, Al.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.200
- Hold on.
- What is it?

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
These coordinates have changed.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.100
- You sure?
- This is unacceptable.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.400
Glenn? Come here.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.100
What?

10:42.300 --> 10:44.800
Every coordinate has been changed.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.100
Yeah.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.400
I changed them.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.200
- You what?
- I changed them.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.400
Why?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
They were wrong.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.700
- Why were they wrong?
- Don't know.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.700
What about them was wrong?

10:57.000 --> 11:01.400
The figures NASA sent us were
for the Northern Hemisphere.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.800
We're in the Southern Hemisphere.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.200
I can change them, but
you're pointing the wrong...

11:08.400 --> 11:11.100
It might be a good idea
to tell us these things.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.200
I didn't want to worry you.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.500
Cup of tea, Al?

11:16.900 --> 11:19.400
- No, thank you.
- I'll have one!

11:19.800 --> 11:20.800
Thank you, Glenn.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.600
- We must double-check.
- All of NASA's work.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.400
Everyone's work, unless you
have a problem with that.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.300
I don't have a problem with that.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.000
- I got a problem.
- Okay, Mitch.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.800
Let's get on with it.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.200
I'll unstow the Dish.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.100
Hi, Bob!

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Bill!

11:47.100 --> 11:48.100
Keith.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.000
Major Mclntyre.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.300
I'm a long time out of uniform.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.200
But you fought a war.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.600
- You'll get your chance.
- I hope so, sir.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.200
- Kid's a cadet.
- Keen.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.200
- Hello, Bob.
- How's it going, Pearl?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.200
Busy as a bee.
The whole town's abuzz.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.600
They'll talk about something
else soon.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.000
I can't say, but we might
be getting a visitor.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.500
The prime minister.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.000
May phoned.
And the American ambassador.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.500
That woman. Can you
keep it under your hat?

12:18.800 --> 12:21.300
- I don't think so.
- Not to worry.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.500
- How are the boys at the Dish?
- Raring to go.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.800
- The American settling in?
- I think so.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.700
Came in yesterday,
wanting pretzels.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.000
Pretzels?

12:33.500 --> 12:35.300
Yep, it's a world event.

12:35.700 --> 12:36.800
The prime minister.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.400
Better get a jiggle-on.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.900
- See you later.
- See ya.

12:40.700 --> 12:44.600
<i>The countdown at the Cape</i>
<i>is proceeding to schedule</i>.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.800
<i>Now back to Cape Kennedy and</i>
<i>correspondent Fred Turner.</i>

12:49.100 --> 12:52.100
<i>What impresses me is we've</i>
<i>got excellent weather.</i>

12:52.500 --> 12:55.200
<i>It was predicted we'd</i>
<i>have some overcast...</i>

12:55.700 --> 12:58.200
<i>and now we'll see the launch.</i>

13:03.000 --> 13:05.100
The launch is going ahead tonight.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.400
The ball is Friday night.
Can we get back to...?

13:09.700 --> 13:12.000
Yeah. It got another surge.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.400
I could rumba right now.

13:24.900 --> 13:28.100
- I hope we have slow numbers.
- Yes, Mrs. Spiers.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.800
And a new song.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.100
Who's it by?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.100
James Hendrix.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.800
Let's hear a couple of bars.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.100
There's a slower version.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.000
- That's not to go above three.
- Yes, Mrs. Spiers.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.700
- You learned the American anthem?
- The what?

13:59.000 --> 14:03.200
Are you saying you've not
prepared the American anthem?

14:03.700 --> 14:05.200
How does it go?

14:05.600 --> 14:07.400
You've got 48 hours.

14:08.700 --> 14:12.400
I knew it when he came.
NASA's renting the Dish.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.300
But, how about some respect?

14:15.600 --> 14:19.200
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- We're a professional unit.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.000
You right?

14:21.500 --> 14:22.500
Sorry, mate.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.100
Still not flat enough.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.500
I'll give it a tweak.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.600
Drop it a couple of clicks.
Probably on NASA settings.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.100
We're of the radio physics
department, not mugs at this game.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.400
He asked me if we have
a dress standard.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.500
That's hard to believe.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.600
Wish he'd gone home with the
others. What's his problem?

14:53.900 --> 14:55.700
He's just feeling the pressure.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.800
The pressure.
He's got to learn to relax.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.500
I'll tell you a little secret.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.200
He's not the only one.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.700
We got word from Houston.
It's go for launch.

15:13.700 --> 15:17.700
Now the party can start.
Come on in.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.000
Pick up the phone, and I yell
"Yeah, what?"

15:21.500 --> 15:23.800
- You know who it was?
- The science minister.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.300
Another devil on horseback?

15:25.600 --> 15:27.700
- They've got families.
- It's extraordinary.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.900
- I wouldn't let Don go to the moon.
- I understand.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.200
How do you reckon they
go to the...

15:33.500 --> 15:34.500
up there?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.200
- I suppose they hold on.
- Four days?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.600
- They're expecting the dance.
- It's a ball.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.200
They don't eat meals, just pills.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.500
You can't hold on for 4 days.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.500
One of these would block
them up for a week.

15:47.900 --> 15:50.200
<i>All is still go as we</i>
<i>monitor our status board.</i>

15:50.800 --> 15:52.100
How's it looking?

15:52.500 --> 15:54.300
It's full of liquid hydrogen.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.600
- Can they fix that?
- No, that's go for launch.

15:57.900 --> 15:58.900
Oh, hydrogen.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.500
- About the prime minister.
- He'll be here on Monday.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.300
- Would they lunch?
- In Melbourne.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.700
Man on the moon, eh?

16:04.900 --> 16:07.200
Yep, and we're a part of it, Dad.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.100
But we're slap bang
in the middle of it.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.600
There could be an announcement.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.000
It's not official yet...

16:16.300 --> 16:18.500
Bob's got the nomination
for Parkes.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.500
- We're not telling anyone.
- What?

16:20.800 --> 16:22.900
Bob's got the nomination
for Parkes.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.700
Congratulations on
the nomination.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.200
Bob, the nomination, well done.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.500
May!

16:34.100 --> 16:36.000
Dad, they're talking about Parkes.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.600
Crikey!

- Wilson Hunter.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.500
Bigwig from NASA.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.100
Dad looked after him. He's
the scientific representative.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.200
That's what it's all about.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.200
Sucking up the bigwigs.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.700
No, that's not it.

17:03.300 --> 17:07.300

Visitor entering compound.
Awaiting identification.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.100
You're being stupid, Rudi.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.300
- Visitor offering resistance.
- You've got a gun.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.400
Official NASA requirement.
Armed security.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.100
Does Mum know?

20:37.500 --> 20:40.100
No, and don't tell her.
She'll come and take it.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.200
- This is getting cold.
- I've got to sign you in.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.300
Entry authorized.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
- And a bikkie too.
- Hello, everyone.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.800
Morning, Mr. Buxton.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.000
If it isn't the most
beautiful girl in Parkes!

20:57.300 --> 20:59.200
- Morning, Mr. Burnett.
- Thank you, Janine.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.900
Morning, Mitch.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.400
- Hello, Glenn.
- Hi, Janine.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.400
I put extra cheese in yours.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.500
- Thanks, Janine.
- You tiger.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.900
- How's Mum?
- Getting ready for the ball.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.500
The whole town's over the moon.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.600
It's so exciting.
The ambassador arrives tomorrow.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.600
Over the moon.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.100
The prime minister on Monday.
On the news they showed Parkes.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.700
- They saw the Dish?
- Everyone's proud.

21:27.100 --> 21:30.900
<i>PKS, Houston Flight Control</i>.
<i>GNC awaiting downlink.</i>

21:33.200 --> 21:35.100
PKS. Roger, Houston.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.800
Was that Armstrong?

21:38.100 --> 21:39.800
No, we're not on-line now.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.000
Sorry?

21:41.300 --> 21:44.300
There's two tracking stations,
us and Goldstone.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.700
- Goldstone?
- California.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.800
If the moon's on our side of
the world, Parkes is on-line.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.700
If it's on the other,
it's Goldstone.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.100
Right, but...

21:55.200 --> 21:57.100
Explain it, Glenn.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.500
Imagine the Earth
is a basketball.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.100
- This'll be good.
- And on top is a...

22:13.700 --> 22:15.200
What do you put the pump into?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.900
- The hole.
- But it's got a name.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.700
The valve.
Say the valve's Goldstone.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.500
- On the other side, another valve.
- Only have one.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.400
What has two valves?

22:26.700 --> 22:27.900
- Tuba?
- It must be round.

22:28.100 --> 22:29.500
- Tambourine.
- That has no valves.

22:29.900 --> 22:30.700
Coconut.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.200
Let's just say the
basketball's got two valves.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.800
When the Goldstone can't see
Apollo 11, Parkes can.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.200
- That's it.
- Good work, Glenn.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.900
How do you know where
Apollo 11 is?

22:42.400 --> 22:43.600
Computer.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.200
In seconds, it does what used to
tame me hours with a slide rule.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.300
And a basketball.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.700
Does the computer move the Dish?

22:51.000 --> 22:54.100
- Mitch does that...
- We have to get back to work.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.700
Thanks for the refreshments.

22:57.700 --> 22:58.700
It was a pleasure.

23:00.700 --> 23:02.900
- Thanks, Janine.
- See you, love.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.000
She's a lovely girl.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.400
Yeah. Not much of a driver though.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.500
You must ask her out.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.900
Ask Janine out?
I don't know, Cliff.

23:20.300 --> 23:23.400
At the cricket club everyone
wants to talk to her.

23:23.700 --> 23:27.600
Gary Kenny's always calling.
They may be dating.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.700
Do you reckon?

23:31.900 --> 23:33.000
Yeah, I reckon.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.000
What if she said no?

23:36.200 --> 23:38.600
Sometimes you got to take a risk.

23:46.100 --> 23:50.300

24:09.100 --> 24:11.600
- Come on, love.
- You've never got due credit.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.500
I've done all right, Maysie.

24:13.900 --> 24:16.800
Don't call me Maysie in
front of the ambassador.

24:17.100 --> 24:20.600
What do I care if some bigwig
yank sees I love my wife.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.600
The blue or the lemon?

24:24.400 --> 24:26.300
- The yellow.
- Lemon.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.300
Maysie, give us a kiss.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.000
- What did ljust say?
- No idea.

24:32.700 --> 24:36.200

will you abolish the draft?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.100
Anything for you, sweetheart.

24:38.300 --> 24:40.400
Dad, it's a political issue.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.100
Leave it with me.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.400
I don't want you and Mitch to
think I'm holding on too tight.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.300
You've got a lot on your plate.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.700
Now the teams have gone
back, I'm responsible.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.500
Am I holding on too tight?

25:04.400 --> 25:06.000
Well, you know...

25:07.600 --> 25:09.400
There's a lot at stake, Al.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.300
There's no guarantees,
a lot of variables.

28:36.900 --> 28:40.700
- What was that?
- A CSM switch. Not to worry.

28:41.700 --> 28:44.400
- Won't be long.
- Take your time.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.100
Can you run a verification...

28:46.400 --> 28:48.600
of projected plot points?

28:48.800 --> 28:50.500
- Done it.
- But not with adjusted bearings.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.600
Oh, well, I stand corrected.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.900
No, you're wrong!

29:04.200 --> 29:05.500
You got a problem?

29:05.900 --> 29:06.700
Yeah.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.600
You treat us like a
pack of galahs.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.800
That's a kind of parrot.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.400
Just because I don't wear a tie
and bury my head in a manual...

29:18.800 --> 29:20.600
doesn't mean I'm a drongo.

29:20.900 --> 29:23.300
- That's a hopeless...
- I get the idea.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.300
I've got complete respect
for your capabilities.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.900
I'd appreciate the same
in return.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.900
- It's time to get along.
- Let me know if...

29:36.300 --> 29:37.700
Don't worry.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.700
Hi, Mr. Burnett.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.200
Guys, I've been calling you.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.200
It's been switched off again.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.000
Testing, one, two...

29:52.500 --> 29:54.100
What are we calling about?

29:55.100 --> 29:56.100
What's that?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.200
What are we calling about?

29:59.600 --> 30:00.900
Oh, it's just the...

30:02.200 --> 30:03.900
Routine call?

30:04.300 --> 30:07.500
Yeah, Mr. Buxton,
it was the routine call.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.100
I'd better get back to my post.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.700
Are we all right here?

30:12.000 --> 30:15.100
That's why I was calling.
Acamera crew's downstairs...

30:15.400 --> 30:17.200
and entry's been authorized.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.400
The ambassador's taking his time.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.600
Must still be at the motel.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.700
You organize that fruit platter?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Yep. Nice big one.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.200
- Major Mclntyre.
- Keith.

30:32.500 --> 30:33.400
Is Marie here?

30:33.700 --> 30:36.800
No. The ambassador's a
cultural imperialist.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.300
She's gone in.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.400
- Be careful, son.
- Yes, sir.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.500
Boy's about to get a taste of war.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.800
Soon we'll be watching TV
pictures from the moon.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.600
Could you explain how these
pictures will be received?

30:51.100 --> 30:52.500
Got a basketball?

30:53.100 --> 30:55.600
When Armstrong emerges from
the lunar landing module...

30:55.800 --> 30:57.700
he'll activate a small
camera here...

30:58.000 --> 31:00.700
which will capture pictures of
him descending the ladder...

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
and walking on the moon.

31:03.900 --> 31:06.900
- How will they return to Earth?
- Carrier pigeon.

31:07.200 --> 31:11.200
A small transmitter will send
the images back to us.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.100
It's amazing technology.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.500
Will the entire...?

31:17.300 --> 31:18.400
Carrier pigeon.

31:20.900 --> 31:22.400
We'll have to go again.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.300
The ambassador of the U.S.A.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.200
- Got a lump in my throat.
- Stop eating those party pies.

31:31.900 --> 31:35.700
You're right, Len. It's
a big day for Parkes.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.800
It's a vindication.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.500
They're here.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.300
What do we call him,
Your Excellency?

31:42.600 --> 31:44.100
He's not bloody royalty.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.300
It's important. We're his
first impression of Parkes.

31:54.300 --> 31:57.800
On behalf of the people of
Parkes, we welcome you.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.500
Thank you, Bob.
I can call you Bob?

32:00.800 --> 32:03.500
- Absolutely, Mr. Ambassador.
- Howard.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.800
- And this is...?
- Len.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.100
Good day.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.500
My wife, May. She's the lemon.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.100
<i>Apollo 11, Houston,</i>
<i>accept the minute 49.</i>

32:13.600 --> 32:15.800
<i>Continue your sequence...</i>

32:16.100 --> 32:19.000
<i>and we'll analyze</i>
<i>the data afterwards.</i>

32:34.900 --> 32:36.400
Time for a cup of tea?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.300
I haven't been treated like this
since I was striping harvesters.

32:43.700 --> 32:47.700
He's a know-it-all who thinks
only Americans work properly.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.500
Aren't you being unfair?

32:50.800 --> 32:53.200
What's happened to you in
the last couple of years?

32:55.700 --> 32:58.100
I'm sorry. That came out wrong.

32:58.900 --> 33:03.200
This was always your dish. You'd
never let anyone else run it.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.200
We're part of a team.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.800
We're part of NASA.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.300
And what's NASA?

33:08.600 --> 33:11.400
Money, equipment, and
everything you ever needed.

33:11.800 --> 33:12.700
No, Mitch.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.000
NASA'sjust a bigger bunch of us.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.300
- You considered this attempt?
- Of course.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.600
We're in the middle of the
greatest feat ever attempted.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.800
This is science's chance
to be daring.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.000
What are you doing?

33:27.600 --> 33:29.600
Standing around, bitching.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.200
Rudi.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.000
Fellas.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.100
Janine brought food
from the dance.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.400
Lovely.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.700
Then her and Glenn are
down there alone?

33:42.100 --> 33:46.400
Yeah. If you guys have noticed,
Janine really likes Glenn.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.000
Is that right?

33:48.600 --> 33:51.200
Rudi, what's with the gun?

33:51.700 --> 33:54.200
It's official NASA installation.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.300
We may need it.
I've tasted it.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.300
- What?
- The food.

34:00.700 --> 34:03.800
Could've been tampered.
We can't take chances.

34:05.100 --> 34:08.800
- You want a couple more?
- Thanks. I'm still starving.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.199
Leaving Sector A.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.100
I thought the foyer
was Sector A.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.400
Yeah, it was.

34:18.500 --> 34:22.300
I've decided to go
alphabetically from top down.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.800
That's not locked in yet.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.400
This whole thing...

34:32.300 --> 34:34.100
I can't believe I'm a part of it.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.600
I certainly can't believe
Rudi's a part of it.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.300
Me too.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.600
Helen would've been proud.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished guests...

35:12.200 --> 35:13.700
please remain upstanding...

35:14.000 --> 35:17.500
for the national anthem
of the United States.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.700
That's not the anthem.

35:42.700 --> 35:45.400
PKS, Houston. Confirm
handover at 17:00 hours.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.700
<i>Roger, PKS. Copy 17:00.</i>

35:48.300 --> 35:50.000
PKS out.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.000
Where'd you get the chocolate?

35:58.800 --> 35:59.900
Janine.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.900
I will, Cliff. I promise.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.200
Everyone wanted to come
but can't find the car keys.

36:16.100 --> 36:20.300
- About to call a cab and...
- The keys hanging on the door.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.500
Why don't we all have a dance?

36:22.900 --> 36:23.800
Why don't we.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.000
Keys were hanging out
the door, Howard.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.700
- Not too racy?
- Oh, no.

36:35.800 --> 36:36.700
Marie.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.500
- What?
- Would you like to dance?

36:41.200 --> 36:42.700
Are you stupid?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
No.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.700
Would you?

36:52.900 --> 36:54.400
I wouldn't be in the way?

36:54.700 --> 36:56.600
We'd be honored to have you visit.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.400
Sorry about the mix-up earlier.

36:59.700 --> 37:03.900
No harm done, Bob. Sometimes I
wish it was our national anthem.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.900
Oh, beauty.
You'll love this bloke.

37:08.100 --> 37:11.900
<i>Fly me to the moon, let me</i>
<i>swing among the stars.</i>

37:13.600 --> 37:15.900
- He's from Brisbane.
- Really?

37:16.500 --> 37:18.400
He's a little like Frank Sinatra.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.100
If not better.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.600
<i>In other words, take my hand.</i>

37:30.800 --> 37:32.900
Who's playing funny buggers?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.200
Shit.

37:38.400 --> 37:42.300
- Sorting it out.
- Not the pie warmer again?

37:47.500 --> 37:49.300
- What happened?
- A blackout.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.900
Control panel's dead.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.700
Have it fixed in a jiffy.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.000
- Receivers?
- Negative.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.900
- Demodulators?
- No.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.100
Whole rack's dead.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.100
Bloody hell.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.100
How about the backup generator?

38:05.100 --> 38:06.200
Shit.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.900
Sorry about that Howard.

38:17.700 --> 38:22.000
No trouble, as long as everything
is fine at the installation.

38:22.400 --> 38:26.400
They have all that under control.
Backup generators, the works.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.500
Still, I'll check with Al.

38:29.800 --> 38:30.900
Where's Al?

38:42.000 --> 38:43.300
Anything?

38:43.600 --> 38:44.700
Nothing.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.300
And we've lost lock.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.800
What happened to the generator?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.300
The fuel pump.

38:56.900 --> 39:00.300
- What about it?
- When I drained it...

39:00.800 --> 39:02.400
I forgot to prime the lines.

39:02.700 --> 39:06.100
You forgot? Jesus!
How could you do that?

39:06.400 --> 39:08.800
- This is what happens...
- Don't you dare!

39:11.200 --> 39:12.600
All right.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.400
We must find that ship.

39:15.700 --> 39:18.200
Switch to manual drive.
Get a lock.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.400
What's its position?

39:22.800 --> 39:24.000
Come on.

39:24.300 --> 39:26.200
I think the computer's wiped.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.500
Shit.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.700
- Are we stuffed?
- Kinda.

39:32.300 --> 39:34.000
Yep, we're stuffed.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.900
What's that noise?

39:39.300 --> 39:40.900
- It's moving.
- How?

39:41.300 --> 39:43.400
- M.E.'s chasing its own tail.
- Shut it down.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.700
We'll have to override...

39:51.300 --> 39:52.700
How far did it move?

39:53.700 --> 39:54.700
Far enough.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.400
Are we sending anything?

40:00.200 --> 40:02.500
<i>Sydney, this is Flight Control.</i>

40:03.200 --> 40:05.100
<i>Are you receiving a</i>
<i>signal from Parkes?</i>

40:06.100 --> 40:07.400
<i>Negative, Houston.</i>

40:08.800 --> 40:11.400
<i>PKS, Flight Control here</i>.
<i>Do you copy?</i>

40:15.700 --> 40:18.100
Flight Control, this is Parkes.
We copy.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.600
<i>Parkes, we'vee lost your</i>
<i>signal. Confirm status.</i>

40:23.500 --> 40:27.900
Houston, Parkes here. We
still have a strong signal.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.900
Must be a relay problem.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.300
<i>Copy, Parkes. We</i>'<i>ll look</i>
<i>into it. Stand by</i>.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.500
Parkes standing by.

40:39.200 --> 40:43.200
That's bullshit.
You bullshitted NASA.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.100
That's not good.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.200
I bought us some time.

40:50.700 --> 40:51.800
Let me get that straight.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.100
You've lost Apollo 11.

40:54.300 --> 40:55.200
Yeah.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.600
Southern Hemisphere's prime
receiving station...

40:58.000 --> 41:00.300
has no idea where Apollo 11 is?

41:00.700 --> 41:02.600
On it's way to the moon.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.500
Computer can't lock us back on?

41:04.900 --> 41:06.400
No. If it loses power,
it loses data.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.600
I thought we had an
uninterruptable power source.

41:08.900 --> 41:13.000
It was, but you see, the
generator didn't kick back.

41:13.700 --> 41:14.400
How come?

41:15.300 --> 41:17.300
Ltjust didn't, that's all.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.700
- Power's on. It's under control.
- Except we've lost Apollo 11.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.000
Except for that.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.900
We still have the data.
It must be programmed back in.

41:26.300 --> 41:27.900
How long will that take?

41:28.800 --> 41:31.900
Hours? A day? Months?
How long, Glenn?

41:32.200 --> 41:33.100
Take a shot.

41:33.700 --> 41:36.400
12... 24 hours?
It's a lot of calculations.

41:36.800 --> 41:40.000
We're not relaying data.
Houston would've noticed.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.300
Well, they did call.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.900
What'd you tell them.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.200
I told them that...

41:46.200 --> 41:48.100
the problem wasn't at our end.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.000
- You lied?
- Bullshitted them.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.900
- We have to tell them.
- That we stuffed it?

41:54.300 --> 41:57.500
Like they stuffed the Southern
Hemisphere coordinates.

41:57.900 --> 42:01.700
- Call for a current position.
- They say we're not required.

42:02.000 --> 42:02.800
Excuse me?

42:03.200 --> 42:05.600
We're dickheads who can't
maintain a signal.

42:05.900 --> 42:07.900
- Cliff, NASAwill...
- Listen, Al.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.900
We can reprogram the system.

42:10.200 --> 42:13.100
Just keen NASA off our
backs for a while.

42:13.300 --> 42:16.500
I am NASAand I say
we tell them now.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.700
<i>PKS, Houston N.C.</i>

42:27.200 --> 42:28.500
<i>Go ahead, Houston.</i>

42:28.700 --> 42:31.800
<i>Spoken to INCO. No closer</i>
<i>to finding this breakdown.</i>

42:32.100 --> 42:34.100
<i>Are you sure it's downstream?</i>

42:37.100 --> 42:38.300
PKS...

42:41.400 --> 42:45.400
it's still on-line. Confirming
loss of signal downstream.

42:46.500 --> 42:49.000
<i>Roger. We'll maintain</i>
<i>alternative feed.</i>

42:50.100 --> 42:50.900
What have I done?

42:51.700 --> 42:54.000
- You bullshitted NASA.
- Good man, Al.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.100
Let's get cracking.

42:59.800 --> 43:03.400
I've never been more proud
of being mayor of Parkes.

43:04.300 --> 43:08.000
Plus, I went home with the
prettiest girl at the dance.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.100
- You look great in yellow.
- Lemon.

43:14.300 --> 43:15.200
Lemon.

43:20.400 --> 43:21.500
Who's that?

43:21.700 --> 43:22.700
Crikey!

43:23.000 --> 43:26.200
Press will come and
won't be mugs.

43:28.100 --> 43:29.100
All right...

43:30.500 --> 43:33.100
what if you come clean?
Just tell NASA.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.500
- Tell them what?
- That...

43:35.900 --> 43:37.300
we lost Apollo 11.

43:37.700 --> 43:40.000
- I wouldn't say that first.
- What would you say?

43:40.400 --> 43:43.500
"You'll never guess
what happened."

43:43.900 --> 43:45.300
Bob, it's Apollo 11.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.100
What would they do?

43:51.400 --> 43:54.000
- I'm not sure.
- Pull the pin?

43:54.500 --> 43:58.600
Not officially, but
they'd downgrade our role.

43:59.100 --> 44:00.900
We'd lose the moonwalk.

44:03.600 --> 44:07.200
Keep a lid on that.
This will be a joke.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.800
Who goes there?

44:11.500 --> 44:13.200
It's just us, Rudi.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.900
Oh, okay.

44:17.500 --> 44:18.800
Who?

44:19.400 --> 44:20.900
Cliff and Bob!

44:21.600 --> 44:22.900
Oh, hi, Bob.

44:23.100 --> 44:23.800
Rudi!

44:24.100 --> 44:25.500
How are you?

44:25.900 --> 44:27.300
Good. Fine.

44:27.500 --> 44:28.800
Nighty-night.

44:29.100 --> 44:31.300
We know when they reappear,
but not where.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.700
- Same place as yesterday.
- They were orbiting.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.500
Now they're translunar. We'll
have to redo every angle.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.100
That'll take forever.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.900
You can get an approximate
fix, and then scan.

44:43.300 --> 44:44.700
That should do it.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.600
I'll give you a hand
with the figures.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.700
- I know about the generator.
- What?

44:52.400 --> 44:54.300
I forgot to prime the fuel lines.

44:57.100 --> 44:58.300
Well...

44:59.600 --> 45:02.500
those things happen.
Let's get to work.

45:05.800 --> 45:08.400
If we come on stream tomorrow,
it never happened.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.100
You think you can do it?

45:10.900 --> 45:12.700
I made a commitment to NASA...

45:13.100 --> 45:14.800
and I intent to fulfill it.

45:16.100 --> 45:18.100
No tone for a while.

45:18.400 --> 45:22.600
Remember trying to sort out
that contract with NASA?

45:23.200 --> 45:25.000
"What about this or that?"

45:25.300 --> 45:27.200
2 hours, and you finally speak.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.000
"Gentlemen, this should be
the contract:

45:30.400 --> 45:33.000
We agree to support
the Apollo 11 mission."

45:33.300 --> 45:36.800
Just one sentence.
It was wonderful, man.

45:37.700 --> 45:39.000
But this isn't.

45:39.700 --> 45:41.800
This is a shithouse moment.

45:44.100 --> 45:45.600
Halt. Who goes there?

46:43.500 --> 46:44.800
I'm not sure.

46:45.200 --> 46:48.200
- You said you were confident.
- I am. I was.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.700
It's got to be in this range.

46:53.100 --> 46:56.600
If we sweep here, it may be
outside and we'll miss it.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.800
If we sweep wider, we
still might miss it.

47:00.100 --> 47:01.900
You confident about that?

47:02.300 --> 47:06.200
They're in the service module.
The rockets aren't on.

47:06.800 --> 47:09.500
- They just sit and wait.
- Is that right?

47:09.800 --> 47:12.900
- The fastest man has traveled.
- Go on.

47:13.100 --> 47:16.200
It's the most chauvinistic
exercise ever.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.000
That's why nobody asks you.

47:20.900 --> 47:22.400
Here you go.

47:22.700 --> 47:25.000
- I'll get my Saturn V rocket.
- Yeah, go get it.

47:25.300 --> 47:26.500
Thanks, love.

47:28.100 --> 47:30.100
Is everything all right
at the Dish?

47:31.100 --> 47:33.900
- Can you keep a secret?
- No.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.700
What's happened?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.900
What if we split the difference?

47:39.200 --> 47:41.100
Ship's moving too fast.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.200
Let's call Houston,
ask for coordinates.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.400
They'll know we bullshitted.

47:46.700 --> 47:48.100
Let's say what happened.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.300
That we lied?
That'll go down well.

47:50.600 --> 47:51.800
I don't it will.

47:53.300 --> 47:54.300
Morning, everyone.

47:55.700 --> 47:56.800
How's it going?

47:58.200 --> 48:00.700
- Good.
- You were on the new last night.

48:04.200 --> 48:05.400
Is everything all right?

48:11.300 --> 48:12.500
Yeah. It's fine.

48:13.500 --> 48:15.900
Glenn was just checking...

48:16.800 --> 48:18.300
- some stuff.
- Really?

48:20.300 --> 48:22.500
I'd better let you get to it.

48:22.800 --> 48:25.300
- Sorry for interrupting.
- Not at all.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.400
- Thanks for the food.
- It was my pleasure.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.500
What do you wanna do?

48:33.600 --> 48:35.900
Let's give this some thought.

48:36.100 --> 48:37.400
<i>Sector G, come in.</i>

48:37.700 --> 48:39.700
Let me try something.

48:41.600 --> 48:44.500
- Not now, Rudi.
<i>- You've got a visitor.</i>

48:44.800 --> 48:46.400
<i>It's the ambassador.</i>

48:48.600 --> 48:50.300
<i>From America.</i>

48:50.500 --> 48:52.000
Oh, God!

48:52.400 --> 48:54.600
<i>- Is this thing working?</i>
- Just a moment, Rudi.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.400
<i>Roger, Sector G. Confirm</i>
<i>Sector A. Hold on.</i>

49:02.400 --> 49:04.700
Didn't think he'd come so soon.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.100
Well, he's here.

49:06.400 --> 49:08.500
Space nut knows
all about Apollo 11.

49:08.900 --> 49:10.000
He know where it is?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.200
Let's make the brief.
Send him up, Rubi.

49:14.700 --> 49:15.500
<i>Roger that</i>.

49:19.200 --> 49:20.800
This is the main control panel.

49:21.500 --> 49:25.700
That moves the Dish up and
down, and that sideways.

49:26.800 --> 49:27.800
It's incredible.

49:28.900 --> 49:33.000
You can pinpoint a tiny spaceship
thousands of miles away...

49:34.100 --> 49:35.400
and lock onto it.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.300
Pretty much.

49:41.500 --> 49:44.500
The ambassador didn't sign in,
but I've let it go.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.300
I didn't want to pull rank.

49:48.300 --> 49:53.000
The other facilities, North
West Cape and Honeysuckle Creek...

49:53.500 --> 49:55.800
also have voice and telemetry?

49:56.200 --> 50:00.500
But in TV, yours is the
only dish large enough?

50:01.000 --> 50:01.900
Yeah.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.700
How does that make you feel?

50:12.900 --> 50:14.200
Where do you get them glasses?

50:14.500 --> 50:17.700
I'm afraid that we're
entering overlap now.

50:19.500 --> 50:21.300
So you'll be getting transmissions?

50:21.600 --> 50:22.400
Yeah.

50:23.300 --> 50:25.500
You'll be able to hear Armstrong?

50:25.800 --> 50:28.700
Yep, just by hitting
a couple of buttons.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.100
Oh, let's do that.

50:37.100 --> 50:37.900
Sure.

50:38.700 --> 50:41.300
If I... I don't think...

50:41.900 --> 50:43.400
You're right. I don't...

50:43.600 --> 50:45.700
Just a brief listen, then I'll go.

50:47.900 --> 50:49.200
Not a problem.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.500
I'll have to reorient the...

50:57.000 --> 50:57.900
Al?

50:58.600 --> 51:01.900
If you could patch the audio
in for mezzanine three.

51:04.100 --> 51:07.700
<i>Columbia, Houston, systems</i>
<i>O.K. You're go for audio.</i>

51:08.200 --> 51:09.300
<i>Copy that.</i>

51:10.800 --> 51:14.600
<i>Neil, telemetry reports O2</i>
<i>and CO2 are O.K. And steady.</i>

51:15.200 --> 51:18.200
<i>Biomed telemetry reads...</i>

51:19.700 --> 51:23.400
<i>vital statistics as being</i>
<i>adequate, within the limits.</i>

51:25.200 --> 51:26.200
Copy that.

51:27.300 --> 51:29.300
Neil, we have you currently...

51:29.700 --> 51:32.400
<i>at 124,000 nautical</i>
<i>miles from Earth and.</i>...

51:32.600 --> 51:35.900
<i>at approa</i> c <i>hing velocity</i>
<i>of 32,000 feet per second.</i>

51:38.600 --> 51:39.800
<i>Copy that.</i>

51:41.600 --> 51:43.900
<i>Columbia, Houston.</i>
<i>Get back to work.</i>

51:45.100 --> 51:46.200
<i>Copy that.</i>

51:46.600 --> 51:48.000
<i>Is that you, Neil?</i>

51:49.700 --> 51:52.400
This is Sector A.
Is that you, Mr. Armstrong?

51:54.700 --> 51:57.800
Must be crossed line from
Honeysuckle Creek.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.800
We're really going to have
to get back to work.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.800
- Understood.
- I'll see you out.

52:05.700 --> 52:07.000
I'll just move the Dish.

52:14.300 --> 52:16.000
That's incredible.

52:17.100 --> 52:19.100
That was a true highlight.

52:19.700 --> 52:21.300
I was going to say good luck...

52:21.700 --> 52:25.500
but after what I've seen,
you don't need it.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.500
Thank you very much, sir.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.900
- You'll never guess what happened.
- Later, Rudi.

52:38.700 --> 52:41.400
- Should he sign out?
- Just wave, Rudi.

52:43.900 --> 52:45.500
That's got to be a felony.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.400
Let's find the ship.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.900
Impersonating a person in orbit.

52:51.300 --> 52:52.600
It's a moving target.

52:52.900 --> 52:56.200
Everything is moving. If we
had a point of reference...

52:57.100 --> 52:59.400
Take a punt. Choose a sector.

52:59.700 --> 53:02.400
- Still a long shot.
- Thought you were confident.

53:02.700 --> 53:04.300
I know where Apollo 11 is.

53:09.300 --> 53:10.400
On its way to the moon.

53:13.500 --> 53:15.100
Your point of reference.

53:16.700 --> 53:20.300
They've gone 150,000 miles.
There're within 3 or 4 degrees.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.200
That might be okay.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.400
I think that might be okay.

53:31.100 --> 53:34.200
We can rub this out?

53:45.300 --> 53:46.800
5707.

53:48.500 --> 53:49.500
5708.

53:53.500 --> 53:54.900
There's your moon.

53:59.800 --> 54:01.600
Have a fish around.

54:27.100 --> 54:28.100
6730.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.500
6731.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.000
We've got a signal!

54:40.600 --> 54:41.900
It's Apollo 11!

54:43.000 --> 54:45.100
- Definite?
- 2.28.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.700
It's the tin can.

54:54.600 --> 54:55.900
Yep! Signal lock!

54:56.100 --> 54:58.200
<i>Houston, Apollo 11.</i>...

54:59.400 --> 55:01.100
PKS, Houston Net Two.

55:01.900 --> 55:03.400
<i>Houston, PKS</i>.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.800
Parkes is on-line.

55:06.100 --> 55:09.500
<i>Copy, Parkes. We are</i>
<i>re</i> c <i>eiving your signal.</i>

55:09.800 --> 55:11.800
Switching to master equatorial.

55:12.200 --> 55:13.900
And with 15 minutes to spare.

55:14.300 --> 55:16.300
It's enough time to
check the generator.

55:20.700 --> 55:22.400
That's great news, Cliff.

55:24.500 --> 55:25.900
I got to dash.

55:26.400 --> 55:28.700
I appreciate the call.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.000
What?

55:32.400 --> 55:33.500
Yeah. Bye.

55:34.500 --> 55:36.100
- Major Mclntyre!
- Keith.

55:39.300 --> 55:40.200
What?

55:40.500 --> 55:42.400
I wanted to ask Marie something.

55:45.900 --> 55:47.200
Fire when ready.

55:49.900 --> 55:51.600
Marie, it's Keith!

55:53.800 --> 55:57.000
Want to watch the moon
landing with me on Monday?

55:57.400 --> 55:59.900
Don't you get it?

56:01.300 --> 56:02.600
Get what, sir?

56:03.200 --> 56:05.000
I think that's a "no".

56:06.200 --> 56:08.100
You're a brave lad.

56:13.700 --> 56:15.800
<i>Apollo 11, here Houston, over</i>.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.200
<i>Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11</i>.

56:18.400 --> 56:21.400
<i>11 this is Houston. You</i>
<i>are going for LOI, over.</i>

56:22.100 --> 56:23.800
<i>Roger, go for LIO.</i>

56:24.500 --> 56:26.900
<i>Houston, can you give me</i>
<i>a time check?</i>

56:27.200 --> 56:31.300
<i>I give you a mark at 13 minutes</i>
<i>and 30 seconds to ignition.</i>

56:31.800 --> 56:33.100
<i>Roger, out.</i>

56:33.400 --> 56:37.100
<i>Apollo 11, this is Houston.</i>
<i>All your systems look good</i>.

56:37.400 --> 56:39.500
<i>- See you on the other side.</i>
<i>- Roger.</i>

56:39.900 --> 56:43.900
<i>... on orbit of the moon,</i>
<i>preparing for lunar descent...</i>

56:44.400 --> 56:46.600
<i>- on Monday afternoon.</i>
- That's all we need to know.

56:46.900 --> 56:49.300
- Vol-au-vent?
- Thank you.

56:49.700 --> 56:51.200
The boys gave you a tour?

56:51.500 --> 56:53.700
Yes. Very impressive facility.

56:53.900 --> 56:55.800
You actually heard Neal Armstrong?

56:56.100 --> 56:57.300
I had the privilege.

56:57.500 --> 56:58.700
How did he sound?

56:59.100 --> 57:01.100
Like he was next door.

57:19.700 --> 57:21.400
That was a day and a half.

57:22.500 --> 57:24.200
I'll be 52 on Monday.

57:24.400 --> 57:25.700
Happy birthday.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.700
And half of them in radio-
telescope mapping the stars.

57:31.100 --> 57:32.600
Then this came along.

57:34.900 --> 57:35.800
Your pipe?

57:36.300 --> 57:40.700
No, the moon mission. Know what
I thought when I first came up?

57:41.400 --> 57:42.500
You beauty?

57:42.800 --> 57:46.200
I thought:
"Lmagine stuffing that up."

57:47.100 --> 57:48.600
Isn't that odd?

57:49.000 --> 57:49.900
What?

57:50.400 --> 57:53.500
That I was more scared
than excited.

57:53.800 --> 57:56.700
That's not odd.
I feel like that all the time.

57:59.800 --> 58:01.200
How come you changed?

58:02.700 --> 58:04.600
My wife said something:

58:05.900 --> 58:09.000
"Failure is never quite so
frightening as regret."

58:09.500 --> 58:11.500
That's good advice.

58:11.800 --> 58:13.000
Pretty good.

58:13.200 --> 58:15.200
I wish someone would tell me that.

58:16.600 --> 58:18.500
God bless you, Glenn.

59:25.800 --> 59:28.100
When I said I was sorry...

59:28.500 --> 59:30.200
I was sorry for everything.

59:30.700 --> 59:32.600
- Oh, Mitch, that's not...
- No, no, no.

59:32.900 --> 59:34.800
When you first arrived I felt...

59:35.300 --> 59:38.000
you're a hotshot from NASA and
I'm a dumb country kid...

59:38.700 --> 59:40.400
with the arse fallout
out of me daks.

59:41.200 --> 59:42.900
- Your...?
- Pants.

59:43.400 --> 59:44.600
I was wrong.

59:44.900 --> 59:48.600
I never thought of you with
your ass falling out of your...

59:49.000 --> 59:50.100
Daks.

59:50.400 --> 59:52.400
Not everyone at NASA's
a college genius.

59:52.700 --> 59:55.300
The guy I most admire is
from a one-horse town in Ohio.

59:56.300 --> 59:57.500
What's he do?

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.800
Tomorrow he'll walk on the moon.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.000
Who's the guy?

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.600
Armstrong.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.300
It would have been okay
to tell Houston.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.100
Things go wrong there
all the time.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:13.800
Mission control goes blue when
50 people hold their breath.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.300
Do you know how many
rockets blew up?

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.800
- That's a while yet.
- 6 weeks ago.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.600
Testing the lunar module.
10 simulations without a hitch.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.300
On the 11th, the controls
jammed, it crashed.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.900
Any idea why?

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.700
We still have no idea why.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.100
Let's hope 11 isn't
an unlucky number.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.300
We pray for those brave souls...

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.900
who, as we speak...

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:44.000
are taking the 1st steps in
exploring God's great universe...

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.400
and for the technicians and...

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.000
scientists who contribute
to this brave endeavor.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.100
You think this Apollo 11
thing's big here?

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.300
- You can't imagine.
- Really?

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.200
What were you saying last night?

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.100
You shouldn't drink so much?

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.100
If you'll excuse me.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.000
He came for dinner.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:11.600
Imagine 2 basketballs. One
there, one there and a valve.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.500
- They won't televise always.
- Wouldn't think so.

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:20.500
Bounces off the basketball,
and then off Goldstone.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.200
Could they hide behind a rock?

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.800
Depends on doing a number...

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.300
or doing a number...

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.800
What was that, Ray?

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.700
We're talking about
the TV coverage.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.900
Where can I take a...?

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.900
Thanks for the sandwiches.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.800
- Thanks for fixing the bumper.
- That's okay.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.300
- Maybe...
- Janine, I was won...

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.600
- You go first.
- No, you.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.300
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.500
What about you?

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800
Nothing

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.600
Has he asked her out yet?

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.700
This is painful.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.200
I really like weekends too.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.300
And Fridays cause you're
looking forward to the weekend.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.500
What were you going to say?

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.200
Nothing.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.300
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.300
All right.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.500
- See ya.
- See ya.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.400
Want to go out Friday night?

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.000
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.600
Did you say: "Want to
go out Friday night?"

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.400
Maybe.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.200
I'd love to go out Friday night.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.900
With me?

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.300
Yes.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.000
Right-o then.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.300
Right-o then.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.100
He ask her out?

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.100
I'm not sure.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.600
I had a chat with Al this morning.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.800
Really?

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.700
He's not such a bad bloke.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.900
You should give him a chance.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.600
- You'll be right?
- Yeah.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.800
- Lf you got any problem...
- I'll call Rudi.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.500
- That's Parkes lamb.
- I've got enough.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800
Plenty more.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.300
- I'll have the vegetables.
- Yes, dear.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.500
- This is wonderful.
- Glad you could get away.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.500
The boys have it under control.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.200
- When are you up?
- At 4.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.800
Tomorrow's the big day.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.200
All being well.

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.200
Man on the bloody moon. Gravy?

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:22.100
Sending men off into the galaxies
as the world watches.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.200
Takes your mind off concerns.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.300
Elbows.

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.700
The whole school will watch it.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.700
Every school will watch it.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.500
- What are you estimating?
- 600 million.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.100
600 million!

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.200
600 million.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.400
- Peas?
- No.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.800
Can people in India watch it?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.500
Yeah, but all on the one telly.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.900
- I'm serious.
- Far too serious.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.300
- How they going to film it?
- Cliff?

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.800
A boom outside the camera.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.800
When Armstrong's outside the
module, it'll swing out.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:00.800
- Is there an antenna on the roof?
- Transmitter, Dad.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.700
It's the size of that bowl.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.200
- Pumpkin?
- Yes, please.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.000
All this effort for TV.

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.200
NASA hardly mentioned TV.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.500
Interesting change.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.800
Not sure what's more important,
astronauts or pictures.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.800
How lovely!

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.000
Elbows.

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.000
Can I ask a question?

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.100
Sure.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.400
Is this mission funded by the CIA?

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.800
Not entirely.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.100
Really?

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.200
No.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.000
How do they know they won't sink?

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.000
- Good Lord!
- Crikey.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.600
We know a great deal
about the moon.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:42.300
Soil composition, density,
gravity. Not many mysteries.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.300
If we know so much, why go?

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.900
There's one thing we don't know.

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.800
What, Cliff?

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.300
Whether we can get there.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.200
Elbows.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.000
Well, let's start.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.000
Man on the moon or not,
we've still got to eat.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.600
You'll like that.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.800
Back to work, eh?

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.800
It's all go.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.800
That roast lamb was magnificent.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.500
- You don't get that in Houston.
- No.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.300
- We can't have you wasting away.
- Thank you.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.600
Thank you very much, May.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.300
It's been quite a while since
I've had a good roast.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.400
- Good luck for tomorrow.
- Thank you.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.300
Marie, it was an absolute
pleasure to meet you.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.800
Really?

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.400
Really.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.400
How you feeling?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.800
Fine.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.600
I heard the prime minister
on the news.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.700
Could he shut up about it?

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.300
Don't you wonder what we're
doing in the Apollo 11 mission?

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.400
They'll knight you for this.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.000
Or behead me.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.600
Dad!

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.300
About face!

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.900
Quick march!

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.000
Boy's not a soldier,
he's a kamikaze.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.100
- What are you grinning about?
- Nothing.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.400
You've had a smile all day.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.500
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.500
All right?

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.000
How was lunch?

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.300
- Wonderful.
- We ate an entire sheep.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.700
All in order?

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.400
- I was gonna check the receiver.
- I'll do it.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.100
- I'll stow the Dish.
- I'll take a hayride.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.600
Hayride?

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.600
What's a hayride?

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.300
When it's down, we can't
get up the core.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.700
- It's quicker to go for a ride.
- Interesting.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.100
Okay, Mitch.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.100
Yet strangely, this
is not in the manual.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.100
Curious oversight, right?

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.300
It was good what you said at lunch.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:32.899
What?

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.100
We don't know whether
we can get there.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.500
Yes, that's easy to forget.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.700
Before I left Houston...

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.200
the scientists had planned
everything for Armstrong.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.600
Rock samples,
measuring radiation.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.300
Flight director put his foot
down. So they say:

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:57.800
"When Armstrong gets to the moon,
what should he do?"

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.700
F.D. Says: "Get off it."

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.399
That would be number one.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.600
I kind of felt for him.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.300
There's really only one
thing I want to see.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:18.500
There's something about putting
a footprint on the moon that...

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.700
Makes our spirits soar?

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:23.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.100
Did you come up with that?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.200
I'm ashamed to say I didn't.
It was my wife.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.200
She died last year.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.000
Sorry to hear that, Cliff.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.200
She was so excited by all of this.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.800
Made me realize I should
be excited too.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.200
And I am.

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:52.500
The only thing is,
she's not here to share it.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.800
So... there it is.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.600
34, 36...

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.600
Hold it there.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.200
- Strength?

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.900
Intermittent lock on prime.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.500
- Do you want me to...?
- No.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.500
Glenn, run AGC.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.400
Auto Gain Control running.

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.200
Negative 90. Solid lock.
We're on.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.800
- Switching to M.E.
- Got it.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:33.300

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.100

<i>Eagle, Houston, we see you.</i>

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.700
<i>Roger. Eagle undocked.</i>

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.300

<i>- The Eagle has wings.</i>

<i>Go to continue powered descent.</i>

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.400
They're landed?

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.700
Almost.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.000

<i>Program alarm</i>.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:53.900

<i>Program alarm.</i>

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.500

1201. Excessive overflow.
Computer's overloaded.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.700
They'll abort.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.300
- Okay, we're go.
<i>- We're go.</i>

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.600

<i>Lights on.</i>

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.800
- Fuel?
- I think so.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.800
<i>30 feet down, 212.</i>

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.800

<i>- 4 forward. Drifting right.</i>
<i>- 30 seconds.</i>

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.400
That's a fuel call.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.800
- What?
- 30 seconds of fuel left.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.800
<i>Contact light.</i>

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.600
<i>Okay, engine stop.</i>

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.200
<i>We copy you down, Eagle.</i>

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.700
<i>Houston.</i>...

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.200
<i>Tranquillity Base here.</i>

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.100
<i>The Eagle has landed.</i>

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.200
<i>Roger. Tranquillity.</i>

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.700
They're on the moon.

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:28.700
<i>About to turn blue. Breathing</i>
<i>again. Thanks a lot</i>.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.300
Bloody hell!

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.700
30 seconds of fuel.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.800
- What happens now?
- Sleep break.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.100
It's a good idea.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.100
<i>Confirmed: Armstrong and</i>
<i>Aldrin are on the moon</i>.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.700
<i>Both are preparing for EVA.</i>

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:51.900
- What's that?
- Extra vehicular activities.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.900
The moonwalk.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.200
They got rid of that hydrogen?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.900
They needed that for fuel.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.900
<i>These are not to scale.</i>

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.700
- The prime minister's on his way.
- He's a fascist!

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.300
I beg your pardon!
Bob, speak to Marie.

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.700
I might just shut that.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
What?

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200
Wind.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.700
Glenn's under the Bureau.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.800
- What's it blowing?
- 15 knots.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.600
- We're related to...?
- 30.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.300
So, we're fine.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.600
- For now.
- Come on, Glenn.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.000
If it goes above 30?

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.400
Above 10, we stow the Dish.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.600
That's pointing up. We've
got to be pointing east.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.300
We understand that.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.700
Forecaster says it
doesn't make sense.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.900
- Great.
- He say anything else?

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.500
Hello and goodbye. Very polite.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.100
30 knots can't be the
absolute maximum.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.500
It's the theoretical maximum.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.400
- It's never been tested?
- No.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.400
The Disc can take more than...

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.100
Al, we don't know.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.600
And I don't want to know.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.900
1,000 tons is above that
azimuth track.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.400
That's not good.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.400
All right, let's just...

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.100
We got 9 hours till they walk.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.100
Could this blow itself out?

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.700
Yeah, I reckon it could.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.500
Yeah.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.600
Just ringing to say good luck.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.100
Hang on.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.800
There in a minute!

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.100
It's a bit breezy this morning.
That wouldn't affect...

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:51.800
Right.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.700
What happens then?

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.600
Oh, I see.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.000
You reckon?

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:05.800
Crikey.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.600
It's a special day, Bob.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:11.000
<i>The prime minister</i>
<i>arrived in Parkes.</i>...

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.400
<i>received by the United</i>
<i>States ambassador...</i>.

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.300
<i>and local dignitaries eager to</i>
<i>see the historic landing.</i>

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:21.700
This is Cliff Buxton, the
director of the facility.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.500
Governor-general. That was
the official opening.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.600
Why did they build it here?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.400
If I may, Bob?

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.800
Weather, prime minister.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.800
Parkes has the stable
climatic conditions...

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:38.200
conducive to the operation
of large radio telescopes.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.100
Fire?

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.200
We hit 30 knots.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:52.000
- Get back to the bureau.
- Sure.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.900
- What's up?
- Relax, Rudi.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.600
What's the bell for?

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.500
Let's us know it's windy.

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:02.300
I knew that. It's blowing
a bloody gale outside.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.500
- Well done with this.
- The ladies helped.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.600
No, Apollo 11. Your dish.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.000
Thank you, prime minister.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.500
And congratulations on the nod.
Party needs performers.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.300
- How are they going out there?
- Good. Perfectly.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.800
We sit here for 5 bloody days,
not a breath of bloody wind.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.000
And then, out of nowhere...

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.500
when it's our turn, a bloody
cyclone parks on us!

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.700
Sorry lads.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.200
I might just...

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.300
go check some bloody thing.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.000
Obviously nothing's foolproof.
There's always limitations.

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.500
There are no guarantees,
all things considered.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.900
Life, I guess.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.700
You're joking, aren't you?

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.500
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.000
We have a saying in the Party:

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.800
- "You don't fuck up.!
- And?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.100
That's it.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.200
- What?
- They're going to walk early.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.600
Armstrong's overruled
the sleep break.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.900
He told NASA:
"We don't want to sleep."

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.700
Armstrong goes for it.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.600
- When do they walk?
- Soon. Now.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.000
- So we're off the hook.
- No.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.100
Goldstone has problems.
They want us from the start.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.700
We don't see the moon till one.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.100
12:56.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:50.200
Come 12:56, if Armstrong
hasn't walked...

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.400
this Dish points to the moon.

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:55.400
This is locked down. I
don't care who turns up.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.400
- No one gets in. Understand?
- I understand, sir.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.400
We must move this dish.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.400
- There's a safety issue.
- I understand that.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.700
We're under no obligations.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.400
Mitch, what will happen?

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600
Don't know.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.900
What do you think will happen?

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It's a big sail area.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.700
The wind grabs hold of it...

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:23.900
We wait.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.000
Come on.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.500
They're going early.
Could happen any time.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.400
Come on, you'll miss it.

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:37.500
If I'djust landed on the moon,
I wouldn't want to sleep.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.100
Like telling a kid to sleep
on Christmas morning, eh?

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.500
- More tea, prime minister?
- Yes.

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.200
Lovely.

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:48.900
- They're going early.
- I know.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.300
- You all right?
- I am now.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:53.300
Sorry?

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:56.000
Goldstone can take the pictures.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.200
Goldstone?

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.200
Cliff can't move the Dish
in this wind.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.400
Good Lord!

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.000
Lt'll die down and
they'll use us later.

01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:09.000
It would have been nice to
be there from the start.

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:12.800
Doesn't matter what pictures
are caught by who.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:17.100
We're part of a team.
That's the most important thing.

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:19.900
- You're right.
- Your shirt, Bob.

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:24.100
The boys at the Dish will
be able to relax.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.300
Getting worse. It's gusting to 50.

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:35.600
We can't move this dish.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.900
<i>PKS video, Houston TV, Net 2.</i>

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.400
PKS video. Go ahead.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.600
<i>Got problems with Goldstone.</i>
<i>Need you as prime receiver.</i>

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.200
Prime?

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.500
<i>The signal between Goldstone</i>
<i>and Houston is dead</i>.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.900
<i>It's gone to ground and</i>
<i>it's still go for walk.</i>

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.200
We'll advise when in position.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.800
<i>Roger, PKS.</i>

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.900
<i>Soon as possible, please.</i>

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.300
Glenn, come here.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.800
Mitch, talk to me.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.700
- Shaking in upright position.
- What?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.100
It's not designed to take
these sort of forces.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.700
Finish what you're saying.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.100
It could collapse.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.200
- Man's about to walk on the moon.
- And he will.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.600
But no one will see it.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.800
There are 5 lives at risk.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.400
I'm responsible for those lives.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.300
Many would say that's sufficient
not to move the Dish.

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.500
Everyone'll accept that.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.200
But will you?

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.700
This is science's chance
to be daring.

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.200
If we don't move it,
it might as well be rubble.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.100
Al.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.000
I still think 11's a lucky number.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.600
- Glenn.
- What?

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.600
Sometimes, you got to take a risk.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.500
All right.

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:15.900
Let's do it.

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.700
I like Cliff. He goes for it.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.800
From North to South, they
come from near and far...

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.200
to witness man take to the sky...

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.800
in search of moon and star.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.700
But ponder this as rockets fly.

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.200
Jesus!

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.300
65 miles an hour.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.100
Keep going, Mitch.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:54.900
'Tween Armstrong and Buzz
Aldrin the lunar surface near.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.800
<i>What's happening now?</i>

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.600
<i>We can tell Armstrong has</i>
<i>commenced evacuation.</i>

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.500
<i>We expect TVpictures</i>
<i>at any moment.</i>

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.700
What the hell was that?

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.900
Drive cogs must've slipped.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.500
Or Janine's trying to park.

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:27.400
Stick with it, Mitch.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.000
I'm staying, whatever happens.

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.200
<i>Okay, Houston, I'm on the porch.</i>

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.400
- He's out of the LEM.
<i>- He's outof the LEM.</i>

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:36.000

We're in position.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.800
Good boy.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.100
Glenn?

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.300
Nothing.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.400
negative.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.700
- Glenn?
- Moon's still not high enough.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:37.900
Go lower, Mitch.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.100
I'm at 60-0-3.
Next stop's concrete.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.500
- Offset feed!
- Offset!

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.000
<i>Okay, that</i>'<i>s good.</i>

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.500
Come on.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.100

- Travel so far from...
- Thanks, Betty.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.900
I've got another 2 verses.

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.000
Man's about to walk on the moon.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.200
<i>You got a good picture, huh?</i>

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.200
<i>There</i>'<i>s contrast...</i>

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.400

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:21.300
That's Armstrong!

01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.300
On the moon!

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:28.600

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.900
<i>It's not collapsed too far...</i>

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.900

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.500
<i>- We</i> c <i>opy</i>.
<i>- It takes a good little jump</i>.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.900
Switch back to main axis.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.700
- How's that?
- Fine.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.800
<i>The LEM footpads are only...</i>

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
<i>depressed in the surface</i>
<i>about 1 or 2 inches.</i>

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:36.600
<i>Although the surface</i>
<i>appears to be very...</i>

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.800
<i>very fine-grained.</i>

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:42.100
<i>It's almost like a powder</i>.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.400
<i>I'll step off the LAM now.</i>

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.800
<i>That</i>'<i>s one small step for man...</i>

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.200

<i>That beautiful from here, Neil.</i>

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.800
<i>It has a beauty all its own.</i>

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.300
<i>It's like the high desert</i>

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.400
- Dad, he's on the moon!
- I know, mate.

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.700
<i>It's very pretty out here.</i>

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.900
Thank God for that hydrogen.

01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:23.400
<i>Are you getting a TVpicture,</i>
<i>Houston?</i>

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.100
You bet ya.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.400
<i>Neil, yes, we're getting</i>
<i>a TVpicture.</i>

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.700
<i>You're in our field of view.</i>

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:35.600
<i>I'm on the top step.</i>

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.200
<i>It</i>'<i>s simple to hop from</i>
<i>one step to the next-</i>

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.000
<i>You got 3 more steps</i>
<i>and then a long one.</i>

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.300
<i>There you go.</i>

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.500
<i>Beautiful view.</i>

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.900
<i>Isn't that something?</i>

<i>Magnificent sight out here.</i>

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.700
You can stay this one.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.200
Enough.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.900
<i>For those who haven't read it...</i>

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:30.000
<i>we</i>'<i>ll read the plaque on the</i>

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.700
<i>It says:</i>

<i>"Here, men from the</i>

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:17.900
<i>Great.</i>

<i>You're the only person that</i>

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.400
<i>That's all right. I don't mind.</i>

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.800
<i>How's the quality of the TV?</i>.

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.300
<i>It's beautiful, Mike, really.</i>

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.800
<i>Beautiful, just beautiful.</i>

It's a wonderful day for Parkes.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.000

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.200

I'm going to have to ask you to
go through the public entrance.

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:38.200
- I'm sorry.
- Tours are on the hour.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.200
Maybe not today but, I may
come back another time.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.900
I'd do it. People get
quite a buzz here.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.200
I'll bet they do.

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.000
Do I know you, sir?

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.800
No, I don't believe so.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.600
You look familiar.

01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:58.100
Well, I better be off.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.900
Back out and around to the left.
