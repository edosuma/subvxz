WEBVTT

00:03.600 --> 00:05.485
What do you think I said?

00:05.901 --> 00:09.126
Ma, I told Sydney she's more than

00:09.212 --> 00:10.558
welcome to freeze her
own head when she dies,

00:10.582 --> 00:11.776
but mine is being cremated

00:11.800 --> 00:13.176
and scattered at the nearest Hooters.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.300
No, I know. She's crazy.

00:15.800 --> 00:19.050
Even if it works, who
wants to live forever?

00:19.200 --> 00:21.445
Live fast, die young, you know?

00:24.300 --> 00:26.600
What are you doing?
The sign said "walk"!

00:26.635 --> 00:27.635
No way!

00:27.900 --> 00:29.315
My light was green.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.476
You ever see streetlights
malfunction like that?

00:41.500 --> 00:43.390
That's not a malfunction.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.387
That's an S.O.S.

01:39.027 --> 01:40.143
The lights went crazy.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.610
There was all kind of blinking lights.

01:41.634 --> 01:45.599
My light was green, so it's
frightening that anybody...

01:47.685 --> 01:49.896
City engineers traced the disturbance

01:49.920 --> 01:51.861
to an underground power node.

01:51.885 --> 01:54.785
Back traced the source, they found this.

01:57.685 --> 01:58.685
Hey, boss.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.685
Meet Marine Officer Major John Maguire.

02:02.785 --> 02:04.334
At least that's what his I.D. says.

02:04.369 --> 02:05.861
It's hard to tell with the, uh...

02:05.885 --> 02:06.750
you know, the one eye.

02:06.785 --> 02:08.261
Yeah, where's the missing one?

02:08.285 --> 02:10.360
Your guess is as good as mine.

02:10.384 --> 02:12.785
Major worked under Marine
Corps Systems Command,

02:12.820 --> 02:14.585
was liaison to the civilian sector

02:14.620 --> 02:16.355
for N.B.C. preparedness.

02:16.685 --> 02:19.085
Nuclear, biological and chemical.

02:19.120 --> 02:19.950
Very good.

02:19.985 --> 02:22.150
I'm proud of you, like a weird uncle.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.796
Hey, boss, you may not
have noticed, but the...

02:23.820 --> 02:25.261
Door locks from the outside.

02:25.285 --> 02:27.150
Oh, so you noticed that.

02:27.185 --> 02:29.261
Meaning someone else
locked him down here.

02:29.285 --> 02:31.861
Yeah, you really want to impress me,

02:31.885 --> 02:32.885
Tell me why.

02:36.285 --> 02:39.290
Did he know where his S.O.S. was going?

02:40.085 --> 02:41.250
Not a chance.

02:41.285 --> 02:43.585
Shorting the power box was clever,

02:43.620 --> 02:44.852
but a shot in the dark.

02:44.887 --> 02:46.050
Lucky it worked at all.

02:46.085 --> 02:48.050
And someone was able to figure it out.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.261
Well, that's precisely
why S.O.S. was chosen,

02:51.285 --> 02:53.661
'cause it was so very recognizable.

02:53.685 --> 02:56.755
Dot-dot-dot,
dash-dash-dash, dot-dot-dot.

02:57.085 --> 02:58.785
Unlike the old signal,

02:58.985 --> 03:00.585
which was CQD,

03:00.985 --> 03:03.250
come quick distress.

03:03.285 --> 03:06.061
Just the S.O.S.? That's all he sent.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.861
Morse code's a dying art.

03:07.885 --> 03:08.850
Was for him.

03:08.885 --> 03:11.065
Well, he could have sent a message

03:11.100 --> 03:13.245
and no one would have recognized it.

03:13.285 --> 03:15.585
Present company excepted.

03:16.085 --> 03:16.950
Cause of death?

03:16.985 --> 03:18.585
Well, he didn't suffocate.

03:18.620 --> 03:20.123
There are no signs of cyanosis

03:20.147 --> 03:22.685
to indicate oxygen deprivation.

03:22.885 --> 03:26.925
No petechial hemorrhages that
would indicate strangulation,

03:27.285 --> 03:30.050
there's no blunt or sharp force trauma;

03:30.085 --> 03:33.885
In fact, there's no sign
of any trauma at all.

03:34.185 --> 03:35.761
Other than the missing eye.

03:35.785 --> 03:38.361
That would explain his death, Timothy.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.280
Blood came from somewhere.

03:40.885 --> 03:43.761
Yes, well, I think the blood
on the hands is superficial.

03:43.785 --> 03:46.585
From several torn cuticles and,

03:46.620 --> 03:48.050
uh, pads.

03:48.085 --> 03:50.361
Looks like he literally
tried to climb the walls.

03:50.385 --> 03:52.095
Oh, that's odd.

03:52.185 --> 03:54.285
99.1.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.250
It appears our corpse

03:57.285 --> 03:59.175
is running a slight fever.

03:59.485 --> 04:00.961
What happened down here?

04:00.985 --> 04:02.685
Whatever happened,

04:02.720 --> 04:03.785
someone

04:04.085 --> 04:05.265
wanted to watch.

04:10.485 --> 04:11.650
Though the idea

04:11.685 --> 04:14.685
of the artificial eye was centuries old,

04:14.885 --> 04:18.060
it didn't really take off
until the early 20th century.

04:18.084 --> 04:19.649
A group of Germans

04:19.685 --> 04:22.084
toured the United States custom-fitting

04:22.120 --> 04:24.552
glass eyes to those who needed them.

04:24.587 --> 04:26.961
Yes, which would've included you, Major,

04:26.985 --> 04:29.085
had you still been alive.

04:29.385 --> 04:31.985
Sadly, the outbreak of war

04:32.020 --> 04:33.225
led to shortages,

04:33.485 --> 04:35.865
resulting in ill-fitting eyeballs

04:35.900 --> 04:38.245
which had a tendency to pop out

04:38.385 --> 04:41.985
during rigorous interpersonal activity.

04:42.285 --> 04:43.250
Such as?

04:43.285 --> 04:46.125
I leave that to your imagination, Tony.

04:46.785 --> 04:49.140
But I do have a cause of death.

04:49.185 --> 04:50.250
I was hoping there was

04:50.285 --> 04:51.985
a reason you called me down here, Ducky.

04:52.020 --> 04:54.202
Yes, the Major's death occurred

04:54.237 --> 04:56.385
as a result of acute organ failure

04:56.420 --> 04:58.685
brought about by hyperthermia.

04:59.085 --> 05:00.885
It wasn't that cold down there. No.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.285
Hyperthermia, Tony, not hypo.

05:03.685 --> 05:06.485
His body temperature literally
became too hot to handle.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.650
Wasn't that warm down there.

05:07.685 --> 05:11.284
No, indeed it wasn't, but
the hyperthermia would explain

05:11.319 --> 05:14.861
the elevated body temperature
I found at the crime scene.

05:14.885 --> 05:18.385
One mystery solved. Unfortunately,

05:18.585 --> 05:21.485
the Major does not appear to suffer

05:21.520 --> 05:23.261
from any of the risk factors

05:23.285 --> 05:24.850
involved in heatstroke.

05:24.885 --> 05:26.761
Well, he still managed to die from it.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.200
Yes, indeed he did.

05:28.785 --> 05:32.585
You know, certain
medications can interfere

05:32.620 --> 05:34.561
with the body's cooling processes,

05:34.585 --> 05:37.361
but we'll have to wait for
Abby's toxicology report

05:37.385 --> 05:39.445
to see if that is a factor.

05:39.985 --> 05:40.961
I get it.

05:40.985 --> 05:43.125
Rigorous interpersonal activity.

05:48.185 --> 05:50.061
Maybe it was a trophy
for the crypt keeper.

05:50.085 --> 05:52.155
The wound was self-inflicted.

05:54.485 --> 05:57.961
Are you saying that he...
He tore out his own eyeball.

05:57.985 --> 05:59.985
You know, I found traces

06:00.285 --> 06:03.685
of vitreous fluid under his fingernails.

06:04.385 --> 06:05.561
Well, where'd it go?

06:05.585 --> 06:07.345
We didn't find an eyeball
at the crime scene.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.525
It was at the crime all right,

06:11.885 --> 06:12.885
hiding...

06:13.685 --> 06:14.985
in his stomach.

06:16.985 --> 06:20.760
You didn't find a toe in
there, too, did you Duck?

06:20.985 --> 06:22.461
How'd it get in his stomach?

06:22.485 --> 06:23.861
Oh, I don't know, Tony.

06:23.885 --> 06:26.385
But there are only two
pathways into the stomach.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.150
Neither possibility

06:28.185 --> 06:30.185
is particularly appetizing.

06:38.785 --> 06:40.435
Thank God you're here.

06:41.285 --> 06:43.055
I really need your help.

06:43.585 --> 06:45.961
You've got to stop me from
doing something stupid.

06:45.985 --> 06:48.645
I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.

06:50.385 --> 06:51.550
All these tattoos.

06:51.585 --> 06:52.661
You know, I get really nervous

06:52.685 --> 06:54.861
'cause it's such a final decision.

06:54.885 --> 06:57.385
Should I go with something
a little esoteric or...

06:57.420 --> 06:59.861
I don't know, maybe a little Eastern.

06:59.885 --> 07:01.185
Ah, Ganesh.

07:01.485 --> 07:03.445
The Hindu god of wisdom for me,

07:03.480 --> 07:05.405
the wise one. What do you think?

07:06.385 --> 07:08.861
I don't think I'm the
one to ask about this.

07:08.885 --> 07:09.850
But Gibbs,

07:09.885 --> 07:12.050
you know me better than anyone else

07:12.085 --> 07:14.361
and when you're gonna make a
decision that's gonna affect

07:14.385 --> 07:16.885
the rest of your life, you
need the person around you

07:16.920 --> 07:19.310
that knows you best for guidance.

07:19.385 --> 07:20.385
Please?

07:21.485 --> 07:24.200
Where do you want to put the tattoo?

07:25.785 --> 07:28.061
Okay, you're right.
You're not the one to ask.

07:28.085 --> 07:29.250
Toxicology report.

07:29.285 --> 07:31.785
I heard about Ducky's
unexplained hyperthermia.

07:31.820 --> 07:34.150
I can explain it. I
found traces of three

07:34.185 --> 07:36.585
quinuclidinyl benzilate
in Major Maguire's blood.

07:36.620 --> 07:39.285
NATO calls it BZ gas.
We call it Agent Buzz.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.550
It's an incapacitating agent

07:40.585 --> 07:42.685
that causes hyperthermia,
severe hallucinations

07:42.720 --> 07:44.852
and, in large enough doses, death.

07:44.887 --> 07:46.961
It's a chemical weapon, Gibbs. Whose?

07:46.985 --> 07:47.950
It's hard to tell.

07:47.985 --> 07:49.761
Chemical weapons are banned,

07:49.785 --> 07:52.461
but they're still allowed
for research purposes.

07:52.485 --> 07:54.435
Even by our own government.

07:54.485 --> 07:55.796
Can you tell which lab it came from?

07:55.820 --> 07:57.725
No. But I do have a lead.

07:57.785 --> 08:00.050
The camera that you pulled

08:00.085 --> 08:01.950
from the sewer is Wi-Fi based.

08:01.985 --> 08:05.085
It works by piggy-backing on
local, unprotected networks.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.450
Once it's on the Internet,

08:06.485 --> 08:08.035
it can be routed anywhere at will.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.585
And it makes it totally untraceable.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.415
But you traced it anyway.

08:11.985 --> 08:13.985
Let me know when you...
I got an address. Yep.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.165
No, I mean, I got an address.

08:16.385 --> 08:18.961
The killer watched the Major
die from a bowling alley,

08:18.985 --> 08:20.985
19 Bella Street.

08:21.885 --> 08:25.320
Of course, whoever was
there is probably long...

08:25.985 --> 08:28.685
gone... by... now.

08:35.485 --> 08:37.260
I got a bad feeling about this.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.861
We let the elf lord go in,
we may never get him out.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.061
Getting old, Tony.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.861
Tony, you and Ziva take the back.

08:42.885 --> 08:45.040
Elf lord, you're with me.

08:46.367 --> 08:51.316
This place ain't doing me
any good I'm in the wrong town

08:51.431 --> 08:55.004
should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there...

09:01.197 --> 09:03.221
Gonna take dancing lessons.

09:03.324 --> 09:04.381
Do the jitterbug rag.

09:04.899 --> 09:06.359
Ain't no shortcuts.

09:06.973 --> 09:09.933
Gonna dress in drag,
only a fool in here.

09:09.999 --> 09:11.932
Would think he's got anything to
prove Wonder where everyone is.

09:11.956 --> 09:13.948
Wonder where everyone is.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.275
Lot of water under the bridge...

09:23.185 --> 09:24.150
Talk to me, Ziva.

09:24.185 --> 09:27.061
Real service entrance
clear. Standing by.

09:27.085 --> 09:29.285
I just want to know what
the heck you want me to say.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.961
Look, we can do this nice and easy

09:30.985 --> 09:32.461
or not so nice and easy.

09:32.485 --> 09:33.485
Come on, man!

09:38.685 --> 09:39.785
Federal agents!

09:39.820 --> 09:40.850
Drop your weapons!

09:40.885 --> 09:43.035
Federal agents, put 'em down! Drop 'em!

09:43.070 --> 09:45.185
NCIS, drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons!

09:45.220 --> 09:47.561
How about we all drop our weapons?

09:47.585 --> 09:50.655
Since clearly we're
all on the same team.

10:02.738 --> 10:04.338
Mamoun Sharif.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.803
CID was able to trace an old lead from

10:06.846 --> 10:09.846
when Sharif was working as
a paid informant for the CIA.

10:09.919 --> 10:13.438
The trail led to an alias
which led to a credit card.

10:13.473 --> 10:14.803
Which led to a bowling alley.

10:14.838 --> 10:17.814
Yep. Funny, us running
into each other like that.

10:17.838 --> 10:18.838
Funny?

10:19.938 --> 10:21.114
You have a better word?

10:21.138 --> 10:23.503
A few come to mind.

10:24.638 --> 10:27.514
So the real question:
Are our cases connected?

10:27.538 --> 10:28.903
As connected as McGee

10:28.938 --> 10:30.914
and his cute, little writing pipe.

10:30.938 --> 10:32.314
The prints on the computer that was used

10:32.338 --> 10:35.214
to monitor the sewer
match the prints on file

10:35.238 --> 10:37.128
from Sharif's CIA report.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.903
The Mad Bomber is back.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.114
Except he's not using bombs this time.

10:41.138 --> 10:42.488
So where did he get the BZ gas?

10:42.523 --> 10:43.803
One of the Major's duties was

10:43.838 --> 10:46.638
to deliver small quantities
of weapons-grade gases

10:46.673 --> 10:48.038
to civilian research labs.

10:48.073 --> 10:49.103
Ziva, you and Tony...

10:49.138 --> 10:50.849
Run down the list of
the Major's deliveries,

10:50.873 --> 10:51.914
starting with the most recent.

10:51.938 --> 10:54.714
And find out... If any of
them were BZ gas. On it.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.014
They always finish
your sentences for you?

10:57.038 --> 10:58.988
I teach them to anticipate.

10:59.338 --> 11:00.714
Well, they do it well.

11:00.738 --> 11:02.214
You must be a good teacher.

11:02.238 --> 11:04.128
Well, thank you very much.

11:10.638 --> 11:13.638
Uh, boss, if Sharif was
trying to cover his tracks,

11:13.673 --> 11:15.414
why would he go to all this trouble

11:15.438 --> 11:17.214
just to kill Major Maguire?

11:17.238 --> 11:18.703
It does seem unusual

11:18.738 --> 11:20.938
that Sharif would have wasted the BZ gas

11:20.973 --> 11:22.113
the way he did.

11:24.538 --> 11:26.128
He wasn't wasting it.

11:26.338 --> 11:27.693
He was testing it.

11:30.638 --> 11:32.113
Testing it for what?

11:33.138 --> 11:34.238
It's a chemical weapon.

11:34.273 --> 11:35.273
Take a guess.

11:35.338 --> 11:37.538
I meant do you have anything specific?

11:37.573 --> 11:39.038
A date, a target?

11:39.073 --> 11:40.073
No.

11:40.338 --> 11:41.103
Nothing yet.

11:41.138 --> 11:43.003
Is there any hard intel

11:43.038 --> 11:44.988
suggesting that Sharif
is planning an attack?

11:45.023 --> 11:47.080
You mean, other than the
dead guy in our morgue?

11:47.115 --> 11:49.114
If you're worried about
the lack of chatter...

11:49.138 --> 11:51.338
- Don't.
- The last time Sharif planned an attack,

11:51.373 --> 11:52.933
there was zero uptick.

11:54.938 --> 11:56.903
He certainly proved last time

11:56.938 --> 11:59.438
that he was a pro at
flying beneath our radar.

11:59.473 --> 12:01.938
Yes, but even if he's
planning on not using

12:01.973 --> 12:03.003
the gas himself...

12:03.038 --> 12:06.108
He'll sell it to someone who will. Yeah.

12:07.638 --> 12:11.438
Homeland Security certainly
loves non-specific threats.

12:12.638 --> 12:14.103
So, how are we going to handle this?

12:14.138 --> 12:16.638
Our investigations have merged.
Who's gonna take the lead?

12:16.673 --> 12:19.298
You'll be working under Agent Gibbs.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.114
Your boss and I flipped a coin for it.

12:22.138 --> 12:23.493
Is that a problem?

12:23.938 --> 12:24.703
No problem.

12:24.738 --> 12:27.273
- I'm just...
- Used to being on top.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.338
In command, yes.

12:30.538 --> 12:32.049
But I've worked with Agent Gibbs before

12:32.073 --> 12:33.803
and I'm happy to again.

12:54.838 --> 12:57.137
You two have worked
together a while, huh?

12:58.638 --> 12:59.638
How long?

13:00.138 --> 13:02.208
The reason... you're asking?

13:03.538 --> 13:04.538
Just curious.

13:06.238 --> 13:07.238
Forget it.

13:27.438 --> 13:29.114
Major Maguire was here last week.

13:29.138 --> 13:30.263
Secure delivery.

13:30.638 --> 13:32.058
Shame what happened.

13:32.838 --> 13:33.914
You seem real broken up.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.814
Hey, I got my own problems.

13:35.838 --> 13:37.737
We upsized our operation after 9/11.

13:37.772 --> 13:39.614
Things haven't quite panned out.

13:39.638 --> 13:41.714
Lines out the door for GameBox Three

13:41.738 --> 13:44.414
and I got warehouses
of this no one wants.

13:44.438 --> 13:46.448
And creditors up the wazoo.

13:47.138 --> 13:48.838
Uh, wazoo?

13:49.538 --> 13:50.238
Huh?

13:50.438 --> 13:51.839
Good luck with that one.

13:53.538 --> 13:54.938
Oh, wait.

13:55.738 --> 13:57.033
Give me a second.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.538
- Hi.
- He's got two cell phones.

13:59.573 --> 14:00.833
One for each ear.

14:01.438 --> 14:04.238
Yeah, I can take a rain check.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.178
Everything all right?

14:09.238 --> 14:11.833
All right, I'll talk to you later.

14:12.638 --> 14:14.614
Sounds like you have
something up your wazoo.

14:14.638 --> 14:16.588
A doctor's probe, perhaps?

14:16.938 --> 14:17.703
Look,

14:17.738 --> 14:19.214
I got a business to run.

14:19.238 --> 14:20.837
If you have any more questions,

14:20.872 --> 14:22.414
you can ask our chief engineer.

14:22.438 --> 14:23.493
He's in here.

14:24.938 --> 14:25.938
Dane.

14:27.638 --> 14:30.114
Tell them what they need to know.

14:30.138 --> 14:31.138
Okay?

14:32.238 --> 14:33.238
Yeah.

14:39.438 --> 14:40.514
What do you need to know?

14:40.538 --> 14:43.714
Well, my partner probably needs
to know your home phone number.

14:43.738 --> 14:45.849
So if you'd just let it go, he
would've thought I was kidding.

14:45.873 --> 14:47.723
I don't want your number.

14:48.538 --> 14:49.503
What do you want?

14:49.538 --> 14:51.638
You got a delivery of BZ gas last week.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.738
We need to confirm the shipment details.

14:53.773 --> 14:54.838
Invoice number?

15:00.238 --> 15:01.703
So, if chemical weapons are banned,

15:01.738 --> 15:03.838
how come you guys are still
doing research with them?

15:03.873 --> 15:05.955
Well, not everyone plays
by the same rules as us.

15:05.990 --> 15:08.038
We still need to certify
that our safety devices

15:08.073 --> 15:09.714
will be functional
against a rogue attack.

15:09.738 --> 15:11.049
The military provides
us with the samples

15:11.073 --> 15:12.633
to certify our devices

15:12.838 --> 15:14.514
and we do the testing.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.188
All right, here we go.

15:16.438 --> 15:18.414
Four kilograms of BZ concentrate.

15:18.438 --> 15:19.438
Four?

15:19.738 --> 15:21.814
According to SYSCOM records, it was 14.

15:21.838 --> 15:22.803
We asked for four.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.514
That's what the Major signed over to us.

15:24.538 --> 15:26.078
Ten kilograms missing.

15:26.438 --> 15:28.508
Is that a lot?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.403
So then the Colonel says to Gibbs,

15:39.438 --> 15:41.787
"Funny, us running into
each other like that"...

15:41.822 --> 15:44.114
McGee, you are reading
way too much into this.

15:44.138 --> 15:45.203
Abby, you were not there.

15:45.238 --> 15:47.314
You did not see the look on Gibbs' face.

15:47.338 --> 15:48.813
Look at what, McGee?

15:49.038 --> 15:49.988
Hi, boss.

15:50.023 --> 15:51.023
I was...

15:51.838 --> 15:54.638
I was just... Talking
about us behind our backs?

15:54.673 --> 15:56.408
Well, we were trying to.

16:03.038 --> 16:04.138
What do you got on Sharif?

16:04.173 --> 16:05.173
On Maguire.

16:05.238 --> 16:07.514
We've been digging all day
trying to find a connection.

16:07.538 --> 16:09.238
Um, one possibility.

16:09.738 --> 16:11.338
A $20,000 deposit.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.814
Wired from an offshore
bank account two days ago.

16:14.838 --> 16:16.814
Is Sharif the source of that wire?

16:16.838 --> 16:18.814
Well, he didn't sign his name on it.

16:18.838 --> 16:19.938
If we can track the source,

16:19.973 --> 16:21.049
it might give us a lead on him.

16:21.073 --> 16:22.073
Yeah, do it.

16:22.638 --> 16:23.438
But wait!

16:23.538 --> 16:25.603
- There's more!
- The Wi-Fi camera

16:25.638 --> 16:28.138
that Sharif used, it streamed
video of Major Maguire

16:28.173 --> 16:29.903
in real time to Sharif's computer.

16:29.938 --> 16:32.288
And we all know that
the Internet was designed

16:32.323 --> 16:34.430
to be a redundant
communications protocol.

16:34.465 --> 16:36.201
Yeah, we were able
to use that redundancy

16:36.236 --> 16:37.938
to find echoes of the original stream...

16:37.973 --> 16:39.438
How long will they go on like this?

16:39.473 --> 16:40.403
Until we stop 'em.

16:40.438 --> 16:43.343
- To ISP and rebuilding...
- McGee.

16:43.838 --> 16:44.723
Bottom line?

16:44.838 --> 16:48.158
We've got the video Sharif took
of Major Maguire before he died.

16:49.338 --> 16:51.114
First he tried to pick the lock.

16:51.138 --> 16:52.908
Then he called for help.

16:53.438 --> 16:55.268
About a half-hour later,

16:55.938 --> 16:57.438
he gets the idea to try and signal

16:57.473 --> 16:58.903
using the power box on the wall,

16:58.938 --> 17:02.414
which caused the traffic
lights on the street to blink.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.928
Watch what happens when
the BZ goes into effect.

17:07.838 --> 17:09.673
He looks really agitated.

17:09.838 --> 17:12.387
BZ gas causes severe hallucinations.

17:12.438 --> 17:14.938
He is literally losing his mind.

17:22.238 --> 17:25.513
Now we know how an
eyeball got in his stomach.

17:25.538 --> 17:26.303
How much?

17:26.338 --> 17:28.438
Um, this is the result of roughly

17:28.473 --> 17:30.333
ten milligrams of exposure.

17:31.938 --> 17:32.938
What?

17:33.038 --> 17:35.014
We're missing ten kilograms, McGee.

17:35.038 --> 17:37.458
That's like a million times more.

17:43.538 --> 17:45.838
Good news, boss. Gordon
Gear ran a full inventory.

17:45.873 --> 17:48.138
The only thing unaccounted
for was the BZ gas.

17:48.173 --> 17:50.414
Does that mean you found Sharif?

17:50.438 --> 17:52.438
I guess he's still unaccounted for.

17:52.473 --> 17:54.105
He's some place doing something.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.839
Figure out where and find him.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.906
- I got an idea, campfire!
- No!

17:57.941 --> 17:59.903
Yes! Campfire's where we all

17:59.938 --> 18:01.403
get together in a free environment,

18:01.438 --> 18:02.549
you know, without
hugging and everything,

18:02.573 --> 18:03.638
we, uh...

18:04.438 --> 18:05.814
not a big fan of the campfire.

18:05.838 --> 18:06.914
Then where is he going?

18:06.938 --> 18:09.538
Same place he always goes to think.

18:16.438 --> 18:17.688
I thought you'd like to know

18:17.723 --> 18:18.914
that Sharif made it to the top

18:18.938 --> 18:21.314
of every agency's Most Wanted list.

18:21.338 --> 18:23.703
Homeland Security's all over it.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.814
Where's your boat?

18:26.838 --> 18:29.414
Well, had to move it to make some room.

18:29.438 --> 18:31.714
- Yeah, but...
- They're covering their asses.

18:31.738 --> 18:35.348
- But where...
- Gonna take them days to do anything.

18:35.738 --> 18:37.714
Yeah, well, they want a briefing.

18:37.738 --> 18:40.138
Chemical weapons are

18:40.438 --> 18:42.914
notoriously difficult to deal with,

18:42.938 --> 18:45.414
and ten kilograms is a large amount.

18:45.438 --> 18:47.514
It could be a land-based attack.

18:47.538 --> 18:49.538
Or worse, something else
we haven't thought of yet.

18:49.573 --> 18:51.893
Well, that's what I'm here for.

18:52.338 --> 18:53.338
Is it?

18:55.438 --> 18:59.168
You say that like you were
expecting something else.

18:59.738 --> 19:00.973
Or is it hoping?

19:02.238 --> 19:04.063
What you got in the bag?

19:05.838 --> 19:06.838
Dinner.

19:08.038 --> 19:10.218
Why don't we start with that?

19:11.938 --> 19:16.128
So maybe Sharif is just gonna
to sell the BZ. He's not.

19:16.538 --> 19:19.438
- And you're so sure of that because...?
- His eyes.

19:19.473 --> 19:20.473
His eyes?

19:20.738 --> 19:22.714
He doesn't want the money.

19:22.738 --> 19:24.033
He wants to kill.

19:24.138 --> 19:25.138
Who?

19:25.638 --> 19:26.503
Sharif's sold himself out

19:26.538 --> 19:28.514
to the highest bidder his whole life,

19:28.538 --> 19:30.514
no matter what side they were on.

19:30.538 --> 19:32.214
I mean, what's changed?

19:32.238 --> 19:33.478
People get older.

19:34.538 --> 19:37.208
Realize they want something different.

19:38.838 --> 19:43.153
And you can tell this just by
looking into someone's eyes?

19:43.938 --> 19:44.938
Yeah.

19:45.138 --> 19:46.138
Okay.

19:49.538 --> 19:51.598
What do you see in my eyes?

19:57.938 --> 20:00.118
That you want me to kiss you.

20:01.738 --> 20:02.938
So are you going to?

20:02.973 --> 20:04.203
- Yeah.
- When?

20:04.238 --> 20:05.478
After we catch...

20:06.338 --> 20:07.338
Sharif.

20:11.738 --> 20:13.403
- That's probably a good idea.
- Really?

20:13.438 --> 20:14.749
'Cause I was hoping
you would think that.

20:14.773 --> 20:15.703
No, no, it's a good idea.

20:15.738 --> 20:18.923
And I'd better go
before I change my mind.

20:19.438 --> 20:20.538
Uh, you know,

20:20.938 --> 20:22.514
we're a distraction to your team.

20:22.538 --> 20:26.014
We can't have anything
interfering with finding Sharif.

20:26.038 --> 20:27.923
And we're gonna find him.

20:28.338 --> 20:29.338
Then what?

20:31.238 --> 20:32.238
Interfere.

20:45.138 --> 20:46.538
Yeah. Gibbs.

20:47.238 --> 20:48.598
Hello, Agent Gibbs.

20:52.538 --> 20:53.714
What do you want, Sharif?

20:53.738 --> 20:54.863
No pleasantries?

20:55.338 --> 20:57.637
That's not very friendly, Agent Gibbs.

20:57.672 --> 20:59.914
You want friendly? Front door's open.

20:59.938 --> 21:00.938
Bring coffee.

21:01.138 --> 21:03.138
I did, but you weren't in.

21:04.338 --> 21:05.338
Nice place.

21:05.538 --> 21:07.088
Got some decorating tips,

21:07.123 --> 21:08.530
but first things first.

21:08.565 --> 21:09.903
I know you are aware

21:09.938 --> 21:14.018
I have almost ten kilograms
of BZ gas in my possession.

21:15.538 --> 21:17.003
I wasn't expecting applause,

21:17.038 --> 21:19.714
but I was hoping for a little bit more.

21:19.738 --> 21:20.814
What do you want?

21:20.838 --> 21:22.703
The United States government is holding

21:22.738 --> 21:25.838
six alleged members of a
Chechen separatist group

21:25.873 --> 21:28.323
in a secret prison in Afghanistan.

21:28.438 --> 21:29.913
I want them released

21:30.138 --> 21:32.038
within the next 24 hours.

21:32.238 --> 21:33.203
Not gonna happen.

21:33.238 --> 21:34.603
Because the United States

21:34.638 --> 21:36.638
does not negotiate with terrorists.

21:36.673 --> 21:38.178
But you misunderstand.

21:38.238 --> 21:39.893
We are not negotiating.

21:40.138 --> 21:41.503
Either you release those men

21:41.538 --> 21:44.368
or I will release more of the BZ gas.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.038
More?

21:46.238 --> 21:48.914
It's hard to say how
many have been exposed.

21:48.938 --> 21:52.198
Airborne weaponry is a
tricky business, but...

21:52.338 --> 21:54.338
I'm sure the 11:00 news will have

21:54.373 --> 21:56.403
a pretty good figure by now.

21:59.038 --> 22:01.838
Authorities are not certain
what is causing the illness.

22:01.873 --> 22:03.703
There are no fatalities as of yet,

22:03.738 --> 22:06.214
but at least six
people have fallen sick.

22:06.238 --> 22:08.638
Actually, counting you, Agent Gibbs,

22:08.673 --> 22:10.038
that makes seven.

22:22.176 --> 22:23.176
Poor Gibbs.

22:23.276 --> 22:24.741
First he loses his memory,

22:24.776 --> 22:26.476
and now he might lose his mind.

22:27.776 --> 22:29.776
Sharif is going to lose
a lot more than that

22:29.811 --> 22:31.431
when Gibbs catches him.

22:34.476 --> 22:35.552
He's not going crazy, is he?

22:35.576 --> 22:37.241
No, he's his usual self.

22:37.276 --> 22:41.076
Which some people might
characterize as unconventional.

22:41.376 --> 22:45.152
I didn't find any trace of
BZ gas in either of them.

22:45.176 --> 22:47.306
Sharif appears to be bluffing.

22:47.676 --> 22:49.446
You're welcome to...

22:49.476 --> 22:50.476
Gibbs!

22:50.876 --> 22:52.952
- I was so worried.
- I'm okay, Abs.

22:52.976 --> 22:54.141
Yeah, me, too.

22:54.176 --> 22:55.576
No fatalities at the hospital.

22:55.611 --> 22:56.541
The dose was too low.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.852
They're reporting it as food poisoning.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.152
But the word is already
beginning to leak out.

23:00.176 --> 23:01.776
How did Sharif deliver the BZ?

23:01.811 --> 23:02.841
I can't tell yet.

23:02.876 --> 23:05.352
The pattern of illnesses appears random.

23:05.376 --> 23:08.252
We're still trying to find a link
between Sharif and the Chechen rebels.

23:08.276 --> 23:09.552
You won't find one.

23:09.576 --> 23:10.676
He's trying to distract us.

23:10.711 --> 23:11.441
From what?

23:11.676 --> 23:12.552
I don't know.

23:12.576 --> 23:14.641
Then what makes you so sure?

23:17.576 --> 23:19.376
Never question the gut.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.541
Going somewhere, McGee?

23:25.576 --> 23:27.152
Actually, looking for you, boss.

23:27.176 --> 23:30.052
Might have found a connection
between Sharif's victims.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.976
Neighbors reported seeing the same truck

23:32.011 --> 23:33.276
outside two of the houses.

23:33.311 --> 23:34.452
Well, you got a plate?

23:34.476 --> 23:35.552
Not enough of one.

23:35.576 --> 23:38.352
All I got is a red
truck, some kind of logo.

23:38.376 --> 23:41.981
Ziva, you and Tony find
out if anyone else saw...

23:43.176 --> 23:44.652
Where the hell is DiNozzo?

23:44.676 --> 23:45.676
You tell me.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.652
Oh, that's right, you won't.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.676
Find him!

23:50.876 --> 23:51.876
Now!

23:52.976 --> 23:54.336
Paging Miss Benoit.

23:54.576 --> 23:58.426
Miss Benoit, please report
to your front door, please.

24:03.576 --> 24:06.276
There's a medical emergency
requiring your assistance.

24:06.311 --> 24:08.276
Miss Benoit, a patient
at your front door

24:08.311 --> 24:09.931
is dying of loneliness.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.652
So when I said "rain check"...

24:13.676 --> 24:14.441
That's weird.

24:14.476 --> 24:16.452
'Cause I thought you said "brain Chex."

24:16.476 --> 24:18.387
Like some kind of breakfast
cereal good for your brain.

24:18.411 --> 24:19.341
What's wrong?

24:19.376 --> 24:21.341
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

24:22.876 --> 24:24.701
That's not what I asked.

24:26.976 --> 24:28.841
If you don't want to
tell me, I can always

24:28.876 --> 24:31.067
look at your horoscope or
read some tea leaves or...

24:31.091 --> 24:34.252
What is it about "no" that
men refuse to understand?

24:34.276 --> 24:36.336
Is this all men or just me?

24:36.476 --> 24:38.452
I got an e-mail from an old friend.

24:38.476 --> 24:40.576
And this old friend is
not good at the "no" word?

24:40.611 --> 24:42.676
No, this friend isn't.

24:42.976 --> 24:45.352
Starting to sound like this may
have something to do with me.

24:45.376 --> 24:47.352
Not everything is about you.

24:47.376 --> 24:48.776
Okay, then.

24:48.976 --> 24:50.576
Enough about me, let's talk about you.

24:50.611 --> 24:52.401
What do you think of me?

24:52.576 --> 24:53.576
Beaches.

24:54.176 --> 24:55.176
Bette Midler.

24:55.211 --> 24:56.476
1987.

24:56.776 --> 24:59.376
1988, actually, but I'm
gonna give it to you anyway,

24:59.411 --> 25:00.952
'cause you're kind of cute.

25:00.976 --> 25:02.252
And you win the prize:

25:02.276 --> 25:04.241
A night with Francois Truffaut.

25:04.276 --> 25:06.752
Actually, probably a couple of
nights, maybe even a long weekend.

25:06.776 --> 25:09.136
We can start with The 400 Blows.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.856
I love Truffaut.

25:11.076 --> 25:13.676
Just so, um, we're clear,

25:14.176 --> 25:17.052
to, you know, make sure there's
no confusion in the future,

25:17.076 --> 25:18.576
when we use the word "rain check,"

25:18.611 --> 25:20.741
we're saying "no" now, right?

25:20.776 --> 25:24.856
Not "no" with a capital "N,"
more like a lowercase "no."

25:25.076 --> 25:26.676
Yes. Perfectly unclear.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.052
You see, this might be why men have

25:29.076 --> 25:30.741
trouble understanding

25:30.776 --> 25:34.176
the feminine of the
"no"... word... thingy.

25:34.976 --> 25:36.152
I'm digging myself a hole, here.

25:36.176 --> 25:39.052
You know, since I'm here,
it's a shame to waste me.

25:39.076 --> 25:40.901
I vote for a group bath.

25:45.576 --> 25:47.376
Is that a "yes" or...?

25:47.576 --> 25:49.476
It wasn't a "no."

25:49.676 --> 25:50.971
That's very good.

26:12.176 --> 26:13.487
Is this about the mystery illness?

26:13.511 --> 26:14.741
I don't know. You tell me.

26:14.776 --> 26:17.852
I'm telling you, I just
got the news flash. Sharif?

26:17.876 --> 26:18.876
Yes.

26:19.776 --> 26:20.836
Where are you?

26:21.276 --> 26:22.276
Off duty.

26:22.376 --> 26:24.352
Okay, this is getting old, Tony.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.552
This is why I don't answer your calls.

26:26.576 --> 26:28.675
McGee found a connection
between the victims.

26:28.710 --> 26:30.752
Their homes were
fumigated by the same firm.

26:30.776 --> 26:32.576
All right. Text me the address.

26:32.611 --> 26:33.636
Where are you?

26:34.776 --> 26:36.556
Tony.

26:36.876 --> 26:38.706
The water's getting cold.

26:40.576 --> 26:42.291
About that rain check...

26:43.076 --> 26:45.576
The pest control firm
didn't realize that one of

26:45.611 --> 26:47.552
their commercial sprayers was missing

26:47.576 --> 26:50.752
until I sent two of my
agents to question them.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.752
We've ID'd Sharif as
one of their employees.

26:53.776 --> 26:54.901
Former employee.

26:56.576 --> 26:57.441
Call you back.

26:57.476 --> 27:00.352
Sharif hasn't shown for
work since the attack.

27:00.376 --> 27:03.452
Probably because he's too busy
preparing for his next one.

27:03.476 --> 27:05.852
The missing sprayer is truck-mounted.

27:05.876 --> 27:08.652
But it could easily be
adapted for a small aircraft.

27:08.676 --> 27:10.541
I'm having mobile sensors deployed

27:10.576 --> 27:12.876
at every Marine and Naval
base on the East Coast.

27:12.911 --> 27:15.376
FAA finish grounding all small aircraft?

27:15.411 --> 27:16.252
In the works.

27:16.276 --> 27:17.941
Ducky says there's an antitoxin.

27:17.976 --> 27:21.152
Needs to be delivered to all
Trauma Ones and base hospitals.

27:21.176 --> 27:22.641
In the works.

27:22.676 --> 27:24.287
I hope "in the works" means
something different here

27:24.311 --> 27:25.576
than it does where I come from.

27:25.611 --> 27:26.611
Keep hoping.

27:32.376 --> 27:34.352
You don't want this being seen?!

27:34.376 --> 27:35.541
It's too late!

27:35.576 --> 27:38.181
Too late! Too late!

27:38.576 --> 27:39.576
Jethro?

27:40.876 --> 27:41.976
Are you okay?

27:44.976 --> 27:46.776
Yeah. Fine.

27:48.476 --> 27:49.476
Colonel Mann.

27:53.676 --> 27:54.681
Yes, Director?

27:54.776 --> 27:55.976
He's not fine.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.552
We're all under a lot of stress.

27:58.576 --> 27:59.871
A word of advice.

27:59.976 --> 28:02.375
Agent Gibbs is one of
the best agents around,

28:02.410 --> 28:04.752
but when it comes to
dealing with bureaucracy,

28:04.776 --> 28:06.652
it's not one of his stronger points.

28:06.676 --> 28:07.726
And your point?

28:07.761 --> 28:08.776
My point...

28:09.276 --> 28:10.241
is that I almost lost

28:10.276 --> 28:11.575
my best agent six months ago,

28:11.610 --> 28:12.852
and I don't want a repeat.

28:12.876 --> 28:14.952
Well, with all due respect, ma'am,

28:14.976 --> 28:17.752
I think Agent Gibbs can
take care of himself.

28:17.776 --> 28:18.976
I think you know that.

28:19.011 --> 28:20.176
Yes, I do.

28:20.876 --> 28:22.171
That will be all.

28:26.376 --> 28:27.652
Rumors continue to swirl

28:27.676 --> 28:29.441
about a possible terrorist attack.

28:29.476 --> 28:32.276
There's been no official
confirmation, but the FAA...

28:32.311 --> 28:33.041
Gibbs!

28:33.076 --> 28:34.076
We have news.

28:34.176 --> 28:36.841
We were able to back trace the
wire transfer to Major Maguire.

28:36.876 --> 28:41.052
It wasn't easy. Most offshore accounts
use a block cipher as a security protocol.

28:41.076 --> 28:42.941
So what we did was we
fooled their system by

28:42.976 --> 28:44.487
- causing a denial - of-service...
- You got a location on Sharif?

28:44.511 --> 28:47.552
Gibbs, the wire transfer
did not come from Sharif.

28:47.576 --> 28:49.166
Who did it come from?

28:51.876 --> 28:54.076
So this is the guy
Ziva was drooling over.

28:54.111 --> 28:55.541
- I wasn't drooling.
- Please.

28:55.576 --> 28:57.476
I saw you undressing him
with your bedroom eyes.

28:57.511 --> 28:58.976
At least I'm not the one asking him

28:59.011 --> 29:00.866
if he waxed his eyebrows.

29:01.776 --> 29:04.976
It's important to
appreciate the competition.

29:07.976 --> 29:09.052
I want a lawyer.

29:09.076 --> 29:10.376
Why? You done something wrong?

29:10.411 --> 29:11.952
I'm admitting to nothing.

29:11.976 --> 29:13.386
You don't need to.

29:13.676 --> 29:17.401
We already know you wired
$20,000 to Major Maguire.

29:18.476 --> 29:20.476
What we don't know is why.

29:20.976 --> 29:22.952
I'm gonna make this real simple for you.

29:22.976 --> 29:25.376
No lawyer, no trial.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.152
Just a room like this until you talk.

29:28.176 --> 29:29.876
That's the way it works for terrorists.

29:29.911 --> 29:31.676
I'm not a terrorist.

29:33.276 --> 29:37.181
Well, you'd better hope you
can convince us otherwise.

29:40.976 --> 29:42.276
All right.

29:43.576 --> 29:46.376
I diverted the BZ gas to Sharif,

29:46.876 --> 29:47.936
not the Major.

29:48.676 --> 29:50.176
When I went to cover my tracks...

29:50.211 --> 29:51.852
Major Maguire found out.

29:51.876 --> 29:52.876
Yeah.

29:53.176 --> 29:55.352
Sharif said he would take care of it.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.041
I got worried when
the Major disappeared,

29:57.076 --> 29:58.987
because I knew the missing
BZ would be traced back to me.

29:59.011 --> 30:00.641
So you made it look like Major Maguire

30:00.676 --> 30:03.752
sold the gas to Sharif by
putting the money in his account.

30:03.776 --> 30:05.652
How much did Sharif pay you?

30:05.676 --> 30:06.476
Nothing.

30:06.676 --> 30:07.676
I paid him.

30:08.076 --> 30:10.801
What, you just like killing Americans?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.876
We weren't planning on killing anyone.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.176
The plan was to scare people.

30:14.211 --> 30:15.352
Hey, it's working.

30:15.376 --> 30:17.552
You guys don't get it, do you?

30:17.576 --> 30:18.787
Every time there's a catastrophe,

30:18.811 --> 30:20.076
someone cashes in.

30:20.376 --> 30:23.176
- Katrina.
- The construction companies cleaned up.

30:23.211 --> 30:24.976
- The tsunami.
- Traders made a killing

30:25.011 --> 30:26.593
on tsunami detection stocks.

30:26.628 --> 30:28.152
And during a chemical scare...

30:28.176 --> 30:30.152
Have you checked the stock market today?

30:30.176 --> 30:32.041
My lab paid me in stock options.

30:32.076 --> 30:34.376
The phony attack that put the
six people in the hospital,

30:34.411 --> 30:35.441
well, that worked,

30:35.476 --> 30:39.252
'cause everybody's running
out and buying gas masks now.

30:39.276 --> 30:41.652
The stock prices went through the roof.

30:41.676 --> 30:43.652
I'll be a millionaire
by tomorrow's bell.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.075
You're going to be in
prison by tomorrow's bell.

30:46.110 --> 30:48.452
You gave a terrorist deadly nerve gas?

30:48.476 --> 30:51.452
Just wait. Now, it's not what you think.

30:51.476 --> 30:53.052
I built in a safeguard.

30:53.076 --> 30:54.441
I denatured the enzyme,

30:54.476 --> 30:55.952
which makes it useless
for an airborne attack.

30:55.976 --> 30:57.787
It was the only way that I
would give him the BZ gas.

30:57.811 --> 30:58.876
Sharif knew?

30:59.576 --> 31:02.176
Stealing the bug sprayer
was just to scare people.

31:02.211 --> 31:04.652
Sharif has the BZ, but
he can't even use it.

31:04.676 --> 31:06.276
I mean, if you ingest
it, it'll kill you,

31:06.311 --> 31:08.152
but, yeah, last time I checked,

31:08.176 --> 31:09.976
bleach and bug spray
will do the same thing,

31:10.011 --> 31:12.161
and you can buy that anywhere.

31:12.276 --> 31:14.346
There is no terrorist attack.

31:15.276 --> 31:19.356
Then why are there six people
in the hospital right now?

31:27.812 --> 31:29.177
Boss, local LEOs

31:29.212 --> 31:31.088
found the stolen sprayers in an alley.

31:31.112 --> 31:32.312
No trace of BZ.

31:42.112 --> 31:44.188
I think maybe Dane was right.

31:44.212 --> 31:46.477
Wrong, Probie. This is Sharif.

31:46.512 --> 31:48.688
He wouldn't go to all the
trouble if he didn't have a plan.

31:48.712 --> 31:51.492
And not knowing is driving boss crazy.

31:51.712 --> 31:53.812
Then explain how Sharif
is going to spread the BZ

31:53.847 --> 31:54.929
if it's been modified.

31:54.964 --> 31:56.012
Maybe it wasn't modified.

31:56.047 --> 31:57.047
It was.

31:57.512 --> 31:59.477
CID's chemical weapons specialists

31:59.512 --> 32:01.612
analyzed the blood of the
victims at the hospital

32:01.647 --> 32:04.332
and confirmed the BZ's been modified.

32:04.512 --> 32:06.388
It's harmless unless ingested.

32:06.412 --> 32:07.662
Which is basically harmless.

32:07.697 --> 32:08.877
It wasn't harmless

32:08.912 --> 32:10.712
for Major Maguire and those six people.

32:10.747 --> 32:12.077
Sharif was in their houses.

32:12.112 --> 32:13.777
He could've spiked their O.J. with BZ.

32:13.812 --> 32:17.237
Or Sharif figured out
a way to modify it back.

32:20.612 --> 32:21.612
Yeah, Gibbs.

32:21.712 --> 32:24.569
Why don't I wait for
you to start the trace?

32:27.512 --> 32:30.488
I just called to see how
you're feeling, Agent Gibbs.

32:30.512 --> 32:33.688
Better than those six innocent
people you put in the hospital.

32:33.712 --> 32:35.362
I'd stop by and pay my respect,

32:35.397 --> 32:37.154
but I'm on my way out of town.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.877
How about I send you a postcard?

32:38.912 --> 32:42.992
I'm planning on traveling
quite a bit for my retirement.

32:43.412 --> 32:45.187
And your Chechen buddies?

32:45.712 --> 32:48.427
I'm not even sure where Chechnya is.

32:49.512 --> 32:51.788
We both know you're not retiring.

32:51.812 --> 32:53.288
With what I've made,

32:53.312 --> 32:55.112
I plan on doing plenty.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.172
Who were they?

32:57.612 --> 32:58.612
Wife?

32:59.912 --> 33:00.912
Family?

33:02.012 --> 33:04.588
Come on, Sharif, I've
been there, I know.

33:04.612 --> 33:06.082
It's not the money.

33:06.612 --> 33:07.612
It's payback.

33:11.812 --> 33:14.227
You won't stop until you get it.

33:14.312 --> 33:15.607
So who were they?

33:22.012 --> 33:23.694
So this is all about payback?

33:23.729 --> 33:25.377
No, he's planning an attack.

33:25.512 --> 33:28.107
And I believe I have a clue

33:28.312 --> 33:30.412
as to what that might be.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.177
Do you see the slight inflammation

33:36.212 --> 33:38.612
of the stratum corneum
of his fingertips?

33:38.647 --> 33:39.377
Slight?

33:39.412 --> 33:40.823
Looks more like he was grating cheese

33:40.847 --> 33:41.677
and forgot the cheese.

33:41.712 --> 33:44.112
Yes, well most of the damage
occurred when Major Maguire

33:44.147 --> 33:46.977
attempted to scale
the walls of his crypt.

33:47.012 --> 33:49.412
But when I learned that
the BZ gas had been modified

33:49.447 --> 33:51.529
so it was no longer an airborne threat,

33:51.564 --> 33:53.588
I looked for other methods of exposure.

33:53.612 --> 33:54.477
He ingested it.

33:54.512 --> 33:57.388
That's a good guess
but also a wrong one.

33:57.412 --> 34:00.212
The answer lies in Major's urine.

34:02.112 --> 34:03.112
Smell that.

34:03.512 --> 34:04.922
I'd prefer not to.

34:07.712 --> 34:08.712
Garlic.

34:08.812 --> 34:11.911
Sharif is spiking garlic with BZ toxin?

34:11.947 --> 34:14.976
No. The contents of
his stomach show that.

34:15.012 --> 34:18.188
Major Maguire hadn't eaten
anything, much less garlic.

34:18.212 --> 34:19.411
It appears...

34:20.212 --> 34:21.411
that Sharif

34:22.012 --> 34:24.411
may have been testing a topical

34:24.812 --> 34:27.012
method of exposure.

34:27.312 --> 34:29.112
Like, uh, sunscreen

34:29.147 --> 34:30.911
or a body oil.

34:31.312 --> 34:33.112
If that is the case,

34:33.812 --> 34:35.812
then that would explain
both the inflammation

34:35.847 --> 34:37.987
and the garlic odor by-product.

34:38.012 --> 34:40.212
Of course, all this will require

34:40.246 --> 34:41.377
a specialized

34:41.411 --> 34:42.712
analysis from Abby

34:43.312 --> 34:45.312
to determine that that is indeed

34:45.347 --> 34:46.347
the case,

34:46.512 --> 34:48.911
and I'm fairly certain that...

34:50.712 --> 34:51.947
Where'd they go?

34:52.312 --> 34:53.688
I'm guessing Abby's lab.

34:53.712 --> 34:55.677
And I know Gibbs always gets his man,

34:55.712 --> 34:59.612
but those two are unusually
motivated to find Sharif.

35:00.612 --> 35:03.512
DMSO are as we professionals call it

35:03.547 --> 35:05.212
dimethyl sulfoxide.

35:05.512 --> 35:07.177
It's an industrial-strength solvent

35:07.212 --> 35:08.977
that has a very interesting side effect.

35:09.012 --> 35:10.912
It carries whatever it
comes into contact with

35:10.947 --> 35:12.987
directly into the bloodstream.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.457
Wow, gold star for the Colonel.

35:16.412 --> 35:18.462
So, it looks like Sharif

35:18.497 --> 35:20.477
has mixed BZ with DMSO.

35:20.512 --> 35:22.277
Which means that all anyone has to do

35:22.312 --> 35:24.512
is come in contact with a
coated surface to be exposed.

35:24.547 --> 35:26.229
The more BZ is in the mix,

35:26.264 --> 35:27.888
the faster it'll take effect.

35:27.912 --> 35:29.812
Anywhere from ten minutes to 36 hours.

35:29.847 --> 35:30.477
How many people?

35:30.512 --> 35:32.177
The bad news, about a 100,000.

35:32.212 --> 35:34.888
Oh, well, the good news
better be really good.

35:34.912 --> 35:38.588
Well, Sharif is going to have
some serious distribution problems.

35:38.612 --> 35:40.777
If he were to go
door-to-door, right?

35:40.812 --> 35:43.388
There's only so many people he
can get to before we get him.

35:43.412 --> 35:46.247
He could do more damage with a shotgun.

35:53.912 --> 35:55.327
You gonna get that?

35:59.112 --> 36:00.212
Yeah, Gibbs.

36:01.612 --> 36:02.688
We'll on our way up.

36:02.712 --> 36:04.302
Got a lead on Sharif.

36:06.412 --> 36:08.088
Guy's been a busy little banker.

36:08.112 --> 36:10.688
He spent the last three
days going from bank to bank.

36:10.712 --> 36:12.077
Depositing or withdrawing?

36:12.112 --> 36:14.088
Withdrawing, and all of it in singles.

36:14.112 --> 36:16.012
12 transactions at 12 different banks.

36:16.047 --> 36:17.788
Which is why it was flagged.

36:17.812 --> 36:19.912
Anti-laundering law used
to say any transaction

36:19.947 --> 36:21.512
over ten grand needs to be reported.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.288
But those were 9,000 each.

36:23.312 --> 36:25.077
Sharif must have known about the limit.

36:25.112 --> 36:28.812
What he didn't know was that the Fed lowered
the threshold to five grand last month.

36:28.847 --> 36:31.812
Since when do you know so much
about anti-laundering laws, DiNozzo?

36:31.847 --> 36:34.812
Well, you should read your
memos more often, then, boss.

36:34.847 --> 36:35.847
Or not.

36:36.112 --> 36:36.817
How much?

36:36.912 --> 36:38.412
108,000.

36:38.612 --> 36:39.962
A lot of singles.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.312
About 108,000.

36:41.612 --> 36:43.912
I have an entirely inappropriate
joke about strip clubs,

36:43.947 --> 36:45.623
but I'm gonna save it for
a less terrifying moment.

36:45.647 --> 36:47.288
He's putting the BZ on the money.

36:47.312 --> 36:49.412
By the time that changes
hands, within 36 hours...

36:49.447 --> 36:51.612
A lot more than 100,000 will be at risk.

36:51.647 --> 36:52.412
DiNozzo.

36:52.612 --> 36:54.488
I'll check casinos and racetracks.

36:54.512 --> 36:56.288
Best places to get rid of
large amounts cash quick.

36:56.312 --> 37:00.612
Agent McGee, airports, stations, any place
Sharif can hit large groups of people.

37:00.647 --> 37:01.877
On it, boss... Colonel.

37:01.912 --> 37:04.388
Ziva, coordinate
roadblocks with local LEOs.

37:04.412 --> 37:06.162
We're going to have to issue a warning.

37:06.197 --> 37:07.715
It's going to wreak
havoc on the economy.

37:07.739 --> 37:09.188
The economy's not
what I'm worried about.

37:09.212 --> 37:11.412
He could be anywhere. We're
not going to find him now.

37:11.447 --> 37:13.012
You reneging on our deal?

37:13.047 --> 37:14.372
- McGee!
- Yeah, boss.

37:14.612 --> 37:15.612
What is this?

37:19.312 --> 37:20.588
Well, it looks like the cash.

37:20.612 --> 37:22.512
I can see that, McGee. No, that.

37:22.547 --> 37:24.462
Right there, what is that?

37:24.912 --> 37:25.677
That.

37:25.712 --> 37:26.947
Let me see this.

37:30.212 --> 37:31.507
Looks like a GBP.

37:31.812 --> 37:32.877
It's a GameBox Portable.

37:32.912 --> 37:34.988
Pest guy said Sharif was addicted to it.

37:35.012 --> 37:36.288
Is that a video game?

37:36.312 --> 37:38.512
Actually it's a wireless
handheld game console.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.188
Wireless? Does that mean it's traceable?

37:40.212 --> 37:42.612
If he's playing it and we
know his online gamer ID, yeah.

37:42.647 --> 37:43.647
We do.

37:46.412 --> 37:48.188
Abs... Tony already called. I'm on it.

37:48.212 --> 37:51.412
It looks like while Sharif was waiting
for Major Maguire to pop his cork.

37:51.447 --> 37:53.512
He spent four hours at the bowling alley

37:53.547 --> 37:54.879
playing an online video game

37:54.914 --> 37:56.177
called Killer Kudsuckers.

37:56.212 --> 37:58.692
- Got his handle?
- I'm almost there.

37:59.412 --> 38:00.212
Oh, look,

38:00.412 --> 38:01.827
it's "Agent Gibbs."

38:02.912 --> 38:05.517
Access in the multi-player registry.

38:06.112 --> 38:06.877
He's online.

38:06.912 --> 38:08.188
He's actually been
online for over an hour.

38:08.212 --> 38:10.123
- He's not in any rush.
- No, he's waiting for something-

38:10.147 --> 38:11.312
a plane or...

38:11.512 --> 38:12.512
Train.

38:13.212 --> 38:15.217
He's at the Amtrak station.

38:21.512 --> 38:22.788
He's still online.

38:22.812 --> 38:25.312
The National Guard is sending
in a response team with antidote.

38:25.347 --> 38:27.023
If someone wants to suggest
waiting for them outside,

38:27.047 --> 38:28.288
I won't complain.

38:28.312 --> 38:30.382
Ziva, walk the station down..

38:30.612 --> 38:31.677
Nothing leaves.

38:33.112 --> 38:34.352
Which way, McGee?

38:35.912 --> 38:38.327
I don't know. He went off-line.

38:40.112 --> 38:41.177
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah, boss.

38:41.212 --> 38:42.912
Have security block all exits.

38:42.947 --> 38:43.947
I'm on it.

38:58.712 --> 38:59.611
Keep the change.

38:59.646 --> 39:00.488
Thank you, sir.

39:00.512 --> 39:04.212
Train 84 to Philadelphia, 30, PA,

39:04.247 --> 39:06.277
is now boarding on track 80.

39:41.312 --> 39:42.787
Boss, you all right?

39:44.712 --> 39:45.712
NCIS!

39:47.512 --> 39:49.757
Get down on the ground, Sharif.

39:59.312 --> 40:00.372
Get the money!

40:00.512 --> 40:02.162
What about Sharif? I got him. I got him.

40:02.197 --> 40:03.715
The money's contaminated. Put it down.

40:03.739 --> 40:05.223
The money's been poisoned. Put it down.

40:05.247 --> 40:07.337
Don't touch the money!

40:23.312 --> 40:24.667
It's over, Sharif.

40:32.112 --> 40:34.127
Something wrong, Agent Gibbs?

40:40.612 --> 40:42.012
What did you do?

40:44.812 --> 40:46.527
Those lovely hand tools.

40:46.812 --> 40:50.077
Undetectable until it
reaches your bloodstream.

40:50.312 --> 40:53.267
A little early, but I'm not complaining.

41:00.512 --> 41:02.812
Their names were Cassandra,

41:02.847 --> 41:04.179
Dimitri and Bashira.

41:04.214 --> 41:05.488
They were my family.

41:05.512 --> 41:07.211
Until one of your country's

41:07.246 --> 41:08.888
smart bombs was not so smart.

41:08.912 --> 41:11.688
Do you know what it's
like to lose your family?

41:11.712 --> 41:14.412
They say everyone you kill,

41:14.912 --> 41:17.212
you just make ten more like me.

41:18.012 --> 41:19.012
I think today

41:19.512 --> 41:21.282
just one will be enough.

41:35.612 --> 41:37.988
Hang on, boss. National Guard's here.

41:38.012 --> 41:38.877
We got the antidote.

41:38.912 --> 41:41.567
You're going to be all right, Boss.

41:50.412 --> 41:51.888
Which happened today.

41:51.912 --> 41:55.012
Nation officials have said
certain areas will remain closed

41:55.047 --> 41:56.047
for further...

41:58.912 --> 41:59.912
Hello.

42:01.812 --> 42:04.537
I thought you were still recuperating.

42:04.812 --> 42:08.012
Oh, I... yeah, I'll buzz you in.

42:08.712 --> 42:10.417
No, you don't need to.

42:12.312 --> 42:13.967
The doors are unlocked.

42:14.012 --> 42:15.192
Yeah, but, uh...

42:15.512 --> 42:16.812
my doorbell works.

42:17.612 --> 42:19.852
Well, then I guess we're even.

42:22.412 --> 42:23.412
So, uh...

42:28.312 --> 42:29.672
You feeling better?

42:29.712 --> 42:33.212
Yeah, I'm sure feeling
better than DiNozzo.

42:33.247 --> 42:34.588
He was about ready to kill himself

42:34.612 --> 42:37.507
when he had to burn that hundred grand.

42:45.412 --> 42:47.472
I came by to say thank you.

42:49.712 --> 42:50.832
You're welcome.

43:10.912 --> 43:12.797
Is that all you came for?

43:13.112 --> 43:14.582
Well, it's a start.

43:24.212 --> 43:26.632
Okay... before we do this,

43:26.667 --> 43:29.052
I just need to know one thing.

43:32.912 --> 43:36.411
How'd you get that damn
boat out of your basement?
