00:56.701 --> 00:58.534
I'M SORRY THAT I'M LATE.

00:58.601 --> 01:00.000
I WAS ABOUT TO CALL YOU.

01:00.067 --> 01:03.467
I SHOULD KNOW BETTER
THAN TO KEEP A BEAUTIFUL

01:03.534 --> 01:05.000
OH, LAYING IT ON THICK,
AREN'T YOU?

01:05.066 --> 01:07.267

01:10.868 --> 01:12.567
DO YOU LIKE CRAB LOUIE?

01:12.634 --> 01:14.267
I DO.
IT IS SO GOOD HERE.

01:14.334 --> 01:16.534
THEY USE STONE CRAB

01:55.801 --> 01:58.234
WE HAVE THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
FROM A FEW CCTV ANGLES,

01:58.300 --> 01:59.601

01:59.667 --> 02:01.834
HE'S CAREFUL TO AVOID
BEING SEEN ON CAMERA.

02:01.901 --> 02:03.901
OUT OF ALL MY CASES,
THIS GUY WAS NEVER FLAGGED

02:03.968 --> 02:05.801
AS TOP PRIORITY,

CHANGES EVERYTHING.

TO CALL US.

02:26.234 --> 02:28.367
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
OUR CON ARTIST
FOR 5 YEARS.

02:28.434 --> 02:30.200
TWO NIGHTS AGO,
I THINK HE KILLED
SOMEONE.

02:30.267 --> 02:33.200
CARLA MARSHALL OF MIAMI
WAS FOUND DEAD IN HER HOME.

02:33.267 --> 02:35.100

BY STRANGULATION.

02:35.167 --> 02:37.267
SHE ALSO HAD TRAUMA WOUNDS
TO THE HEAD.

02:37.334 --> 02:39.000
WHY DO WE THINK
THE CON MAN KILLED HER?

02:39.067 --> 02:40.367
LAST WEEK CARLA CONTACTED
A FRAUD WEBSITE

02:40.434 --> 02:41.934
TO REPORT A SCAM.
THE COMPLAINT ENDED UP

02:42.000 --> 02:43.267
ON GOLDMAN'S DESK.

02:43.334 --> 02:45.400
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE
AT LENGTH.

02:45.467 --> 02:47.167
HER STORY MATCHED MY GUY
TO THE "T."

02:47.234 --> 02:49.400
SHE PLANNED
ON CONFRONTING
HIM THAT NIGHT.

02:49.467 --> 02:51.667
I TOLD HER TO CEASE
ALL COMMUNICATIONS

02:51.734 --> 02:56.200
AND WAIT FOR ME,
I'D FLY TO MIAMI
AND SET UP A STING.

02:56.267 --> 02:57.701
BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.234

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

02:59.300 --> 03:00.701
CONFIRMING
IT'S YOUR GUY?

03:00.767 --> 03:03.968
NO, BUT FOR HER
TO BE MURDERED
THE NIGHT THAT WE SPOKE,

03:04.067 --> 03:06.000
I DON'T THINK
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE.

03:06.067 --> 03:08.901
THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF FORCED ENTRY, THEFT,
OR SEXUAL ASSAULT.

03:08.968 --> 03:11.734
AND JUDGING FROM THE M.O.,
THE MOTIVE WAS PERSONAL.

03:11.801 --> 03:13.467
WHAT'S HIS HUSTLE?
INVESTMENT FRAUD.

03:13.534 --> 03:15.434
BASICALLY,
HE'S A SMALLER MADOFF.

03:15.501 --> 03:17.834
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA
OF HOW CONVINCING HE IS,

03:17.901 --> 03:21.100
THIS IS A SAMPLING OF HIS
WORK GOING BACK 14 YEARS.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.534
HE'S PROLIFIC.

03:22.601 --> 03:25.534
HE'S SCAMMED HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
FROM PEOPLE,

03:25.601 --> 03:28.000
BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN
VIOLENT BEFORE.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.601
CON MEN USUALLY DON'T
MURDER, BUT WHEN THEY DO,

03:29.667 --> 03:31.133

03:34.767 --> 03:37.100
THEY SEE THEIR CONS
AS THEATER AND THEMSELVES

03:37.167 --> 03:39.133
 AS A SORT OF PUPPETEER.
 THEY HAVE TO HAVE
 ABSOLUTE CONTROL

03:39.200 --> 03:40.968
OVER THEIR VICTIMS
AND THEIR CONS.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.467

MAYBE THAT'S WHY
HE STARTED KILLING,

03:42.534 --> 03:43.567
BECAUSE HE LOST CONTROL?

03:43.634 --> 03:45.834
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW OUT OF CONTROL IS HE?

03:45.901 --> 03:48.067
WELL, IF HE'S SPIRALING,
HE'S A DANGER TO
EVERYONE AROUND HIM.

03:48.133 --> 03:49.434

HE'S SO CHARMING,

03:49.501 --> 03:51.234

NEVER SEE IT COMING.

HIS ACCOUNTS OVERSEAS?

05:31.868 --> 05:33.801
WE CAN, BUT IT TAKES MONTHS
TO GET THE RECORDS,

05:33.868 --> 05:35.133

IS FLIGHT, NOT FIGHT.

UP ON THE BOARD.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.934
SHE WAS A REAL ESTATE AGENT.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.434
SHE WAS DOING WELL
FOR HERSELF

07:08.501 --> 07:12.167
UNTIL WILLIAM
CAME INTO HER LIFE.

07:12.234 --> 07:14.934
WHY DO YOU CALL HIM THAT?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.067
HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF
AS BILL, BILLY, OR WILL

07:18.133 --> 07:20.400
SEVERAL TIMES
IN HIS EARLY CONS.

07:20.467 --> 07:21.934
MY GUESS IS THAT
HIS REAL NAME

07:22.000 --> 07:24.234
MAY BE SOME FORM
OF WILLIAM.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.100
SO MOST OF HIS VICTIMS
WERE VERY WEALTHY, RIGHT?

07:26.167 --> 07:28.367
YOU SHOULD SEE
SOME OF THEIR MANSIONS.

07:28.434 --> 07:30.100
WELL, I'M LOOKING AROUND
THIS HOUSE AND IT'S NICE,

07:30.167 --> 07:31.501
BUT NO MANSION.

07:31.567 --> 07:34.133
SHE DIDN'T INVEST AS MUCH
AS HIS OTHER CLIENTS EITHER.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.000
I WONDER WHY
HE TARGETED HER.

07:36.067 --> 07:39.334
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN USEFUL
TO HIM IN SOME OTHER WAY.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.801

07:43.000 --> 07:45.467

COME CHECK THIS OUT.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.467

07:49.534 --> 07:51.300
WHY DIDN'T THE DETECTIVES
FIND THIS BEFORE?

07:51.367 --> 07:53.434

KNOW TO LOOK FOR IT.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.734
NO, JUST PHOTOS
OF NICE CARS AND HOUSES.

08:02.801 --> 08:05.434
SO HE'S SELLING
THE FANTASY OF SUCCESS.

08:05.501 --> 08:06.934
HIS WEB DESIGN
IS PRETTY BASIC.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.501

A STANDARD TEMPLATE.

08:08.567 --> 08:10.067

TO SET UP.

IT'S THE UNSUB'S WEBSITE.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.434
DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT
HOW HE PAID

08:30.501 --> 08:32.000
FOR HIS HOSTING SERVICES,
TRACK HIM DOWN THAT WAY?

WE'LL RUN INTO THE SAME
BACKSTOPPING TRAIL.

FOR WEBSITES

THE SAME CONTENT?

08:40.299 --> 08:43.366

AND SEARCHING...

08:46.100 --> 08:49.300
THERE ARE 1, 2--
9 IDENTICAL WEBSITES,

09:51.367 --> 09:52.667
WE HAVE THE CURRENT ALIASES.

09:52.734 --> 09:54.400
WE JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHO THE CLIENTS ARE.

09:54.467 --> 09:56.300
GOT CARLA'S PHONE RECORDS.
SHE MADE SEVERAL CALLS

09:56.367 --> 09:57.767
TO AN UNKNOWN NUMBER
THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

09:57.834 --> 09:58.767
I TRACKED THE NUMBER.

09:58.834 --> 10:00.467
IT WAS A DISPOSABLE PHONE

10:00.534 --> 10:01.634
THAT HASN'T BEEN USED SINCE.

10:01.701 --> 10:02.968
THAT'S GOTTA BE
THE UNSUB'S NUMBER.

10:03.033 --> 10:04.234
HE TOSSED IT
AFTER HE KILLED HER.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.100
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS,

10:06.167 --> 10:07.634
SHE ROUTINELY
CALLED THIS NUMBER

10:07.701 --> 10:08.801
REALLY LATE AT NIGHT.

10:08.868 --> 10:09.934
HOW LATE?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.434
LIKE BEDTIME LATE.

10:11.501 --> 10:14.334
YOU DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH YOUR
INVESTMENT MANAGER AT BEDTIME.

10:18.901 --> 10:20.667

10:20.734 --> 10:21.667
HI.

10:21.734 --> 10:22.667

OHH...

10:27.234 --> 10:28.167
MMM.

10:28.234 --> 10:30.467
SO, WHEN ARE WE
GONNA DO THIS AGAIN?

10:30.534 --> 10:32.501
UH...

10:32.567 --> 10:35.834
MY HUSBAND'S COMING HOME,
SO...

10:35.901 --> 10:38.534
I WON'T SEE YOU
FOR A WHILE.

10:38.601 --> 10:40.501
I'LL MISS YOU--
GRANT.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.767
YOU LIED TO ME
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

10:42.834 --> 10:44.300

CALL THE POLICE!

10:44.367 --> 10:47.133
AAH!
[GLASS SHATTERING]

10:47.200 --> 10:50.067

10:50.133 --> 10:53.300

10:53.367 --> 10:55.434
HEH.

10:55.501 --> 10:58.000
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, TOO.

11:05.067 --> 11:07.801
SO CARLA NEVER
MENTIONED ANYTHING
ABOUT AN AFFAIR WITH HIM?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.467
NO, BUT IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN A CHALLENGE
WITH FRAUD VICTIMS

11:09.534 --> 11:10.968
TO BE TOTALLY
FORTHCOMING.

11:11.033 --> 11:12.300
THEY'RE SO EMBARRASSED
ABOUT BEING DUPED,

11:12.367 --> 11:13.534
THEY DON'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

11:13.601 --> 11:15.968
DETECTIVE GOLDMAN.

11:16.033 --> 11:17.801
WE'D LIKE TO COMPARE NOTES.

11:17.868 --> 11:18.934

11:19.000 --> 11:21.334
I'M LOOKING AT THE VICTIMOLOGY.
YEAH.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.133
WE SAY AFFINITY GROUPS.
SAME THING.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.033
IT REFERS TO VICTIMS
WITH SHARED INTERESTS.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.100
OK. WE'RE IN YOUR WORLD,
WE'LL USE YOUR TERMS.

11:29.167 --> 11:33.734
YOUR FILES POINT TO SPECIFIC
AFFINITY GROUPS HE TARGETED

11:33.801 --> 11:34.901
IN THE FIRST FEW CITIES.

11:34.968 --> 11:36.234
DOES THIS LOOK ACCURATE
TO YOU?

11:36.300 --> 11:37.501
YES, IT DOES.

11:37.567 --> 11:39.601
ONCE HE GOT BEYOND
SAN DIEGO,

11:39.667 --> 11:41.767
HIS VICTIMS ARE
ALL OVER THE PLACE.
NO SHARED INTERESTS.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.767
I CAME TO THE SAME
CONCLUSIONS.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.100
SO HE STOPPED USING
AFFINITY GROUPS

11:45.167 --> 11:47.334
 AND FOUND HIS VICTIMS
 SOMEWHERE ELSE.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.200
WHERE, I DON'T KNOW.

11:49.267 --> 11:51.367

12:30.534 --> 12:32.501
IT'S MY PARTNER.
[CLEARS THROAT]

12:32.567 --> 12:35.133
YOU DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT A PARTNER.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.667
I DIDN'T?

12:36.734 --> 12:39.033
AND THIS ISN'T WHO I MADE
THE CHECK OUT TO LAST TIME.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.234
HE'S BEEN MY PARTNER
FOR YEARS.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.701
THEN WHY AM I MAKING
THE CHECK OUT TO HIM?

12:43.767 --> 12:46.601
THERE'S A SIMPLE EXPLANATION.

13:07.267 --> 13:11.334
SO, THE UNSUB AND THE VIC
ARE HAVING DRINKS.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.634
THE VIC HAS A CHECKBOOK
AND PEN OUT,

13:13.701 --> 13:15.634
CHECK'S DATED,
BUT THAT'S IT.

13:15.701 --> 13:18.133
THE UNSUB GOT THAT CLOSE
TO GETTING HIS MONEY,

13:18.200 --> 13:19.334
SOMEHOW FAILED,
AND THEN DID THIS.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.300
AND THIS IS OVERKILL.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.634
HE BASHED HIS HEAD IN.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.968
HE'S COMPLETELY UNHINGED
AND DEVOLVING FAST.

13:25.033 --> 13:26.667
ONLY HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

13:26.734 --> 13:28.767
HE'S STILL TRYING
TO GO TO WORK

13:28.834 --> 13:31.200
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW
HE'S IN DANGER
OF LOSING IT AT ANY MINUTE.

13:31.267 --> 13:33.067
LIKE A FUNCTIONING
ALCOHOLIC.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.334
THE UNSUB CHANNELS
ALL OF HIS ENERGY
INTO THESE CONS,

13:35.400 --> 13:37.701
AND WHEN THE CON
FALLS APART,

13:37.767 --> 13:39.000
THIS IS HOW
HE HANDLES IT.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.834
Goldman: HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN RANDY?

13:40.901 --> 13:43.000
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WITH HIM

13:43.067 --> 13:45.200
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.234
HE WAS HELPING US INVEST.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.534
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU GIVE TO HIM?

13:49.601 --> 13:53.701
HE JUST KEPT SAYING
WE NEEDED TO BE AGGRESSIVE
IN THIS MARKET.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.501
OH, MY GOD,

13:55.567 --> 13:56.868
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

13:56.934 --> 13:57.934
JJ: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.133
I MET RANDY.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.033

INTO OUR LIVES.

14:14.334 --> 14:17.934

EVENTUALLY.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000

14:21.067 --> 14:23.567
RANDY WASN'T
WHO HE SAID HE WAS.

14:23.634 --> 14:25.901
RANDY WASN'T EVEN
HIS REAL NAME.

14:25.968 --> 14:28.534
WHAT?

14:28.601 --> 14:32.000
WE THINK THIS MAN IS USING
HIS LOOKS AND HIS CHARM

14:32.067 --> 14:34.334
TO TARGET WOMEN.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.667
SO THERE'S OTHERS.

FOR YOU TO BE NORMAL

16:29.234 --> 16:30.601
TO ELIMINATE
ALL THESE ALIASES,

SYSTEMATICALLY
ASSASSINATE HIS VICTIMS.

IF HE'S WORKING HARDER
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY,

16:41.234 --> 16:43.701
IT MAKES SENSE THAT HE WOULD
EXPAND HIS OPERATING ZONE.

16:43.767 --> 16:45.868

WE NEED TO GIVE THE PROFILE.

16:45.934 --> 16:47.334
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
ABOUT SAN DIEGO.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.834
I NOTICED IN HIS EARLIER CRIMES
HE ONLY STAYS IN EACH CITY

16:49.901 --> 16:51.567
AN AVERAGE OF 14 TO 18 MONTHS.

16:51.634 --> 16:53.901
 THEN HE'S IN SAN DIEGO
 FOR 3 1/2 YEARS

16:53.968 --> 16:55.834
AND THEN NEVER
IN THE SAME CITY
FOR THAT LONG AGAIN.

16:55.901 --> 16:59.934

ABOUT SAN DIEGO THAT
MADE HIM STAY LONGER?

21:31.968 --> 21:33.200

21:33.267 --> 21:34.901
BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO APPEAR NORMAL,

FOR A PSYCHOPATH.

THAT ONE COUPLE FROM EARLIER?

32:15.033 --> 32:16.100
HIS OFFICE SAID
HE'S OUT OF TOWN.

32:16.167 --> 32:17.567

32:26.234 --> 32:27.801
 THEY'RE IN THE WIND, KID.

32:27.868 --> 32:29.234

32:41.534 --> 32:42.467
SOMETHING'S WEIRD.

32:42.534 --> 32:43.601
WHAT?

32:43.667 --> 32:46.234
THE WIFE HAS 2 CELL PHONES
LISTED IN HER NAME.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.267
ONE COULD BE HERS,
ONE COULD BE HIS?

32:47.334 --> 32:48.801
HE PUT THEM BOTH
IN HER NAME.

32:48.868 --> 32:51.801
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE BOTH

33:13.434 --> 33:15.467
WERE WE WRONG ABOUT HER?

33:15.534 --> 33:16.934
DO YOU THINK
SHE'S COMPLICIT?

33:17.000 --> 33:20.133
I DON'T THINK SO. IF SHE WAS,
HE'D USE HER IN THE CON.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.968
HE TOLD ME HIS NAME
WAS HUNTER PORTLAND.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.601

A JUSTIFIED SHOT.

39:35.734 --> 39:37.701
WHY DID HE DO THAT?

39:37.767 --> 39:40.200

A SON.

GOING TO DO WELL IN PRISON.
