00:02.086 --> 00:07.674
So, Ed, l guess you decided to dance on the
edge of the knife and go back to Starbucks.

00:08.217 --> 00:09.967
l did what you said.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.012
l ordered my coffee, gave them my name,

00:13.097 --> 00:16.099
and stepped to the side
like the rest of the morons.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.644
You've come a long way.

00:19.728 --> 00:25.066
That is a far cry from threatening to
"shove a bean grinder up a barista's ass."

00:26.902 --> 00:30.029
l know, l know. l'm late, but it's not my fault.

00:30.114 --> 00:33.241
l'm driving down the freeway,
and this jerk-off cuts right in front of me.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.244
Luckily, l drifted into the other lane
and didn't hit the guy.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.621
Texting saved my life again.

00:39.415 --> 00:42.875
Hopefully, you weren't wearing your seat
belt either because if you had hit the guy,

00:42.960 --> 00:46.087
you wouldn't have been able to fly
through the windshield out of harm's way.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.381
Douche.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.884
Anyway, l was argu-texting with my mom.

00:51.969 --> 00:52.969
She's mad

00:53.053 --> 00:56.681
because another car insurance company
dropped us because of all my accidents.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.349
l hate that stupid little lizard.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.393
-You mean the gecko?
-No, my mom.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.229
But instead of calling her that,

01:03.313 --> 01:06.065
l took a moment, found my center,
and turned off my phone.

01:06.358 --> 01:09.485
-Guys, this is huge.
-This is bigger than huge.

01:09.611 --> 01:13.656
Kim Karcrashian kept her Beemer
on the road and didn't yell at her mom.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.283
Call Anderson Cooper.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.202
No, no, no, no, no.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.455
Lacey's restraint means that

01:20.539 --> 01:23.499
all four of you have gone 30 days
without an anger outburst.

01:23.792 --> 01:24.876
lt's a milestone.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.296
Can we get a cake?
Maybe with a woman jumping out of it?

01:28.756 --> 01:30.965
-That's not appropriate, Nolan.
-You're right.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.842
What if it was an angry woman?

01:33.719 --> 01:36.179
But where would we find
somebody like that?

01:38.056 --> 01:39.515
Angry,

01:40.601 --> 01:42.101
cake-sized.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.395
Tell you what.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.191
Next session, if we've all kept it together,
we'll have a little celebration.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.692
Some cake, a little champagne.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.402
Could we get a real big cake?

01:51.487 --> 01:55.865
Just in case somebody has a few glasses
of champagne and a change of heart.

01:55.991 --> 02:00.995
l'm not promising anything,
but me and champagne...

02:01.663 --> 02:03.790
Stranger things have happened.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.588
You know that thing that you like so much?

02:10.672 --> 02:13.216
That was just the thing that
they threw in with the thing that l bought.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.093
lt was free.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.348
Well, then, l don't feel bad about breaking it.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.228
Okay. l'm going now.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.146
Get off my bra.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.860
Hey, you want to go to a movie?

02:32.945 --> 02:33.945
Why?

02:34.071 --> 02:35.947
l don't know. l thought we'd hang out.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.448
Why now?

02:38.325 --> 02:39.742
'Cause it's still early?

02:39.868 --> 02:42.119
No, l mean, why did you ask me that now?

02:42.204 --> 02:43.287
Well, l was going to ask you during sex,

02:43.372 --> 02:45.248
but you and that thing
were making so much noise.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.377
Yeah, no. Tonight's no good. Sorry.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.463
-Everything okay?
-No, everything's fine.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.508
l just have to do my patient write-ups,
read a couple of psych articles,

02:55.592 --> 02:57.718
watch an episode of
l Didn't Know l Was Pregnant.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.930
l love watching their faces

03:01.014 --> 03:03.599
when they hear their underwear crying
and realize they're a mama.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.311
l feel like something weird just happened.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.314
That is what they say right before
they look in their crying underwear.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.907
-Okay. Well, l will see you later.
-Right.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.870
Hey, Charlie. l have to show you something.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.121
Jen!

03:25.581 --> 03:28.082
Hey, Kate. What are you doing here?

03:30.127 --> 03:31.627
Kate came by to help me.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.754
l was in the shower,
and my back went out again.

03:34.256 --> 03:37.425
Kate is also a certified massage therapist
as well as a real therapist.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.469
She loves the therapies.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.263
-See you tomorrow?
-Yup.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.851
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.853
lt's actually great that you're here.

03:48.937 --> 03:52.732
l have to show Charlie something, but
l would love your opinion as a gay woman.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.611
l'm sorry. Do you prefer "lesbian"?

03:56.862 --> 03:58.279
l know l do.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.991
l answer to either.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.077
Check out Sam's Facebook page.

04:07.456 --> 04:12.752
Oh, man! lt is weird to see her kissing a boy.
lt's even weirder to see it online.

04:12.961 --> 04:16.005
Now, that's a longhair rocker dude,
right? That's not a...

04:17.466 --> 04:19.425
And now l see
why you wanted a lesbian here.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.929
Yes. Sam's kissing a girl.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.555
She might be gay.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.265
How do you want to handle this?

04:26.350 --> 04:28.768
You can't assume she's gay
just because she's kissing a girl.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.270
Well, how old were you
when you realized you were gay?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.065
l don't remember the exact moment.

04:34.149 --> 04:38.653
l just knew
heterosexual sex was so disappointing.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.698
There had to be something better.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.076
Well, if you'll excuse me,

04:45.160 --> 04:48.579
l have to go pick up
some drill bits at Home Depot,

04:48.664 --> 04:50.706
walk my rescue dogs,

04:51.041 --> 04:53.542
and meet another chick
so we can move in together.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.757
-What should we do, Charlie?
-We hear what Sam has to say.

05:00.550 --> 05:04.553
ln the meantime,
we photoshop out the girl, put in Grandma.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.847
Creepiest Christmas card ever.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.145
You know, Charlie,
we're a lot alike, you and l.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.356
Not really.
Your voice is a lot lower than mine.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.608
Aside from that.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.610
You help people through their problems.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.821
l help people through their problems.

05:22.197 --> 05:26.158
Except, l live in my mama's trailer,
and you live in...

05:26.243 --> 05:27.451
Where do you live, Charlie?

05:27.536 --> 05:29.996
lf you're looking for an address,
it's not going to happen.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.916
There is going to come a night when you're
going to beg me to go home with you.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.210
Okay. Okay, but until then,

05:36.294 --> 05:39.338
let's have a few more years of this
"Will they, won't they?" sexual tension.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.884
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.387
l'm glad you changed your mind
about going to the movies tonight.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.097
Do we have time for a drink
or should we get going?

05:48.181 --> 05:51.017
No, let's grab a drink.
lt will give you time to get to know Judy.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.437
You're taking this lesbian thing a little far.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.189
-No, this is your movie date.
-Movie date?

05:57.274 --> 05:59.608
Yeah. l'm not going.
Come on over and meet her.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.738
Excuse me. You called me
and asked me out to the movies tonight.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.241
No, l specifically said,
"Do you want to go to a movie tonight?"

06:07.325 --> 06:09.076
l never said anything about me.

06:09.161 --> 06:12.872
The rest is just some
elaborate fantasy world you've created.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.500
Okay, can we at least agree
that nobody said anything about Judy?

06:16.626 --> 06:19.086
Come on. You're going to love her.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.715
Judy, this is Charlie. Charlie, Judy.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.967
Judy teaches film studies at UCLA.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.178
She knows trivia
about every movie ever made.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.305
She's the perfect movie companion.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.015
Nice to meet you, Judy. Can you excuse us?

06:31.099 --> 06:34.185
Can You Excuse Us?
A little-known film directed by Leo McCarey,

06:34.269 --> 06:36.979
starring Marie Dressler and
a very young Charles Laughton.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.441
That's where the song
Kick lt Up, Teacup comes from.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.610
Academy Award, best song, 1 935.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.322
-And she was free tonight?
-We'll be right back.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.578
-What the hell are you doing?
-You asked me to a movie after sex.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.414
lt obviously represented
your symbolic need to cuddle.

06:55.499 --> 06:58.626
You're getting emotionally attached to me
and we don't want that.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.086
Ergo, Judy.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.130
Are you completely mental?

07:03.298 --> 07:07.718
No, Charlie. l'm re-establishing
that we are not in a romantic relationship.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.888
We are friends. l'm your therapist.
We have sex.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.640
l do not want things to get weird.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.893
l understand my relationship with you.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.312
l don't understand
my relationship with Judy.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.856
So, what, this whole thing
is to prove some crazy point?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.525
No. lt is not a crazy point.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.402
lf we start an emotional relationship,
and it goes south...

07:25.654 --> 07:27.196
And l have counseled enough couples

07:27.280 --> 07:30.407
to know that whenever you get
two people together, it never works.

07:31.409 --> 07:36.747
...we will end up ruining our friendship
and losing everything we have.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.625
Well, if we split up,
you're getting custody of Judy.

07:40.752 --> 07:45.214
lf l see one more sign that you
are getting emotionally involved, it is over.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.767
-Hey, there.
-Hey, There.

07:56.893 --> 08:01.605
A bright little film from 1 947
with Judy Canova and Joe E. Brown.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.692
That was the film debut of
Pop Goes the Weasel.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.112
So how do you know Kate?

08:08.363 --> 08:11.991
We met at a seminar in Buffalo.
l used to be a patient.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.703
Obsessive-compulsive,
but l'm much better now.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.373
Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight?

08:19.457 --> 08:21.458
Come out tonight, come out tonight

08:21.543 --> 08:26.046
Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight
and dance by the light of the moon?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.223
Shouldn't she be here by now?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.726
What time
does the bus get here after school?

08:38.810 --> 08:42.229
Well, the straight bus gets here at 3:00.
The lesbian one gets here at 3:30.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.191
lt takes a long time
to load all those golf clubs.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.318
Hey.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.486
We need to talk.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.571
ls Grandma dead?

08:51.239 --> 08:53.782
No, she's still hanging on, with her money.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.788
We just want to ask you
about a picture we saw on Facebook.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.249
Oh, my God!
Why are you looking at my Facebook page?

09:02.334 --> 09:06.462
Because until you're 1 8, we own you,
and we can trade you with other parents.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.132
We have our eye on
an honor student in your grade.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.177
Let's talk about this picture.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.678
Which one?

09:14.763 --> 09:16.472
The one of you kissing a girl.

09:17.432 --> 09:21.101
l was just trying to get Jake Slater
to like me and he didn't even notice.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.563
Sam, you don't just do things a boy wants
you to do because he wants you to do them.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.316
Yeah. That can lead to
a lot of things you don't want to do.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.360
Also known as my twenties.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.322
lf a boy doesn't like you
because you're straight,

09:33.406 --> 09:35.783
you just keep your chin up
and be proud of who you are.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.452
lt gets better, honey.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.338
Three pages each.

09:49.547 --> 09:54.134
On what happened, how it started,
and how this will never happen again.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.474
l'd like that by Monday, when
our 30-day no anger calendar starts again.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.893
Patrick started it.

10:02.978 --> 10:07.773
All l asked was if maybe you had borrowed
that sweater from a person without a home.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.234
l wasn't judging.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.318
l was.

10:13.822 --> 10:17.074
For what it's worth, l'd like to say this.

10:17.158 --> 10:21.328
l sincerely regret
bringing up the Palestinian situation.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.335
Best party ever.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.758
Yo, yo. What the hell happened here?

10:34.843 --> 10:37.261
We were celebrating
30 days of no anger incidents.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.429
What happened to the cake?

10:38.555 --> 10:41.974
Actually, if you pour plaster in it,
you get a perfect mold of Nolan's face.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.978
-Do you mind helping me clean up?
-l could.

10:46.062 --> 10:49.064
Or we could
leave it like it is and go to a movie.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.026
Then after we come back,
you can clean it up by yourself.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.570
A movie sounds great, but l can't.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.323
Apparently, it would mean l have
some symbolic need to cuddle with you.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.743
Hey, hey, hey, man.
lf you don't want to go, don't go.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.704
l just wanted to
see Adam Sandler get hit in the nuts.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.542
Am l crazy?

11:08.626 --> 11:09.793
l asked Kate to go to a movie

11:09.878 --> 11:12.296
and she said because it was right after sex
that l had feelings for her.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.756
Well, you do, don't you?

11:13.840 --> 11:17.301
l mean, this whole friends with benefits
thing is really about two people in denial.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.094
Absolutely not.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.221
Kate and l know exactly what we're doing.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.140
We are experienced psychologists

11:23.224 --> 11:27.019
who can handle the complexities
of a nonemotional sexual relationship.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.230
Yeah, there's some denial here.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.026
-So you do like her.
-Well, maybe, but it doesn't matter.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.820
She compartmentalizes love and sex.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.822
She doesn't get attached
to the men she sleeps with,

11:38.907 --> 11:39.948
and she doesn't want a relationship.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.867
She's unlike
any other woman you've ever met.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.496
But she has a bunch ofjacked-up
unspoken rules and you broke one, right?

11:45.580 --> 11:46.663
Yeah.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.458
She's exactly like every woman l've ever met.

11:50.001 --> 11:53.796
My only move is to avoid anything that
can possibly be construed as romantic.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.048
She said if l crossed that line again,
sex is over.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.174
lt will never work.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.843
When the rules are unspoken
and the line is invisible.

12:00.220 --> 12:04.181
You know, l saw that on Star Trek.
"Your only hope is time travel."

12:05.725 --> 12:07.267
You're right. You're right.

12:07.352 --> 12:11.021
l need to go back in time to just before
you walked through that door and lock it.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.524
You laugh.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.735
But there's an episode in the new
BattIestar GaIactica where the Cylons...

12:16.861 --> 12:19.113
-Not a lot of second dates, huh?
-No, not a one.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.534
Mom, l'm home.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.285
l'll be right out.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.704
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.543
So what did you end up doing last night?

12:33.002 --> 12:34.711
Went to the movies with some psycho.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.046
Psycho, 1 960,

12:36.131 --> 12:38.465
directed by Alfred Hitchcock,
starring Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.844
l don't want to know.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.556
Has Sam said anything more
about the Facebook pictures?

12:45.640 --> 12:48.016
No, no. Let go of it. lt's over.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.185
l'm not so sure.

12:50.270 --> 12:55.691
You know how Sam got
your nose and your hair and your eyes?

12:55.817 --> 12:56.817
Yeah.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.736
l think
she might have gotten the gay from me.

12:59.904 --> 13:00.988
You're not gay.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.490
Somewhere on one of my old laptops,
l have proof you're not gay.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.412
Charlie, when l was younger,
l had an experience.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.497
l was goofing around with this other girl

13:10.582 --> 13:14.042
and we'd had a couple of wine coolers
and we kissed.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.919
That doesn't mean you're gay, Jen.

13:16.004 --> 13:19.214
lt just means you discovered something that
men have known for thousands of years.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.008
Booze makes chicks horny.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.846
Well, there was this other time.
Do you remember Joe Chandler?

13:25.930 --> 13:26.972
Yeah, played third base.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.558
Well, one time,
you guys were out on the road,

13:29.642 --> 13:33.687
his wife Shawna and l
got together and we hooked up.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.149
-Shawna Chandler, with the thing...
-They were nice.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.696
-Now when you say you "hooked up"...
-We did it.

13:44.199 --> 13:47.493
And that's why l think
l passed on my gay gene to Sam.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.081
Now you think you have a gay gene?

13:53.541 --> 13:56.043
With all the times
l begged you to do it with another chick.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.045
Seriously.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.756
l might have really complicated Sam's life.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.633
Jen, you had a fling.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.052
The worst that happened
is she inherited your fling.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.055
-That doesn't make sense.
-Exactly.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.933
l know why you don't want me to be gay.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.601
Because that would be embarrassing.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.728
lt means that you couldn't satisfy me.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.730
That's completely ridiculous.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.149
Anytime l wanted to satisfy you, l did.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.527
And the rest of the time,
George Clooney brought me home.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.906
Maybe l am overreacting.

14:26.783 --> 14:31.245
Maybe what threw me
was how much l really enjoyed kissing her.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.746
lt was very intimate.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.706
Hey, l think
kissing is more intimate than sex.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.041
lt fools you.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.671
That's why people shouldn't kiss unless
they want to show an emotional connection.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.215
l guess that's why hookers don't kiss.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.925
You're bi-curious.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.843
You understand hookers.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.930
lf l didn't know how this ends,
l would ask you out.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.309
-Hi.
-How was your day, Doctor?

14:54.394 --> 14:58.021
lt's about to get much better, whatever
you call a person with a master's degree.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.774
Master will do.

15:01.651 --> 15:02.901
You wish.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.369
What are you doing?

15:12.453 --> 15:13.912
Why won't you kiss me?

15:14.205 --> 15:16.039
Well, it all started with the movie thing.

15:16.124 --> 15:19.876
l started thinking about what you said about
us not getting too emotionally involved.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.629
l think that kissing
might be part of the problem.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.048
l don't care if you kiss me.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.720
Well, good. 'Cause it gets a little confusing.

15:30.513 --> 15:34.683
A lot of people feel something when
they kiss somebody and we can't have that.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.353
All right. Fine. No kissing it is.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.522
Let's get to it.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.319
Stop.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.238
-What?
-lt's weird.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.991
lt feels like we jumped to the middle.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.827
l think it'll be okay.
lt would be a great time-saver.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.796
Stop. No. Not working.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.549
l need a beginning.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.594
l need an amuse-bouche
before the filet mignon.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.721
My bouche is not amused.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.433
lt's all right.
Give it a minute. We'll get you there.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.851
Okay.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.781
You okay?

16:30.865 --> 16:32.199
l'm sorry.

16:32.283 --> 16:35.285
l don't know what's wrong.
This has never happened to me before.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.872
lt's okay, it's fine.
Happens to a lot of women.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.793
We'll try again in a little bit.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.337
Maybe you could drink some water.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.256
You know, to wet your whistle.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.593
Don't they make products
for this kind of thing?

16:51.719 --> 16:55.806
l have a vagina for this sort of thing
and it usually works.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.184
l think it's the kissing.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.977
l need it to get aroused.

17:01.062 --> 17:06.608
Somewhere in my twisted psyche,
l have tangled up romance and sex.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.570
Okay. lf you need it, l'll do it.

17:11.572 --> 17:12.739
Don't you need it?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.704
Crap. You don't need it.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.083
-Do you want to talk about this?
-No.

17:23.334 --> 17:26.336
Obviously, l am coming down with
something and l think you should leave.

17:26.421 --> 17:30.090
Okay, but it will just take a minute
for things to settle down.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.301
Oh, hey, that look just took care of it.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.806
My problem is

17:37.932 --> 17:41.601
this woman l've been writing to
for the last five years wants a commitment.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.229
Well, good for you, Ernesto.
You got a girlfriend.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.733
Charlie, l don't want a girlfriend.
l don't want to be tied down, homie.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.485
You're in prison.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.196
You're going to be here
for the next 20 years.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.908
What if l want to write to another woman?

17:57.201 --> 18:03.665
Her penmanship is hot, but sometimes,
a guy just wants to see a strange envelope.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.085
That's true.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.129
You show me a letter
with beautiful handwriting,

18:09.213 --> 18:10.922
l'll show you a guy who's tired of reading it.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.178
What is it with women?
All they want is a commitment. Que no?

18:16.262 --> 18:18.638
But sometimes,
it's more complicated than that.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.141
There are women out there
who don't want commitment.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.894
There are women out there
who don't want any emotional involvement.

18:23.978 --> 18:27.230
There are women out there who are so afraid
of commitment and emotional involvement,

18:27.315 --> 18:28.648
they say all they want is sex.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.276
l'll bet she keeps it real nice
down there, too, huh?

18:36.616 --> 18:39.993
l think it's a good time to mention
that when l bring up examples of people,

18:40.077 --> 18:43.497
l'm not talking about a specific person
you can track down when you get out.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.709
Charlie, l think there is a specific person,

18:47.877 --> 18:50.295
and it sounds like
you need to say something to her.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.006
Sometimes you got to tell a person
how you feel

18:53.090 --> 18:55.759
before they feel safe to say what they feel.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.303
Well, l think that's a good lesson
for all of us to remember.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.096
You know another good lesson?

19:00.181 --> 19:02.015
Never cook meth in a Walmart.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.727
Sound advice, Wayne.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.939
Wouldn't want to put all those mom-and-pop
meth labs out of business.

19:12.026 --> 19:14.986
Well, l am glad you decided
to keep your appointment today.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.446
This is therapy.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.698
You're my therapist.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.575
We keep things separate.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.994
So what would you like to talk about?

19:23.079 --> 19:25.121
l'm having problems with my best friend.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.456
-Charlie.
-Not you.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.042
l got a lot more friends than you.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.669
Go on.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.462
l'm also sleeping with this best friend.

19:32.547 --> 19:33.922
-Charlie.
-Not you.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.049
l sleep with a lot of my friends.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.635
l also get this therapist with a huge ego.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.053
-Charlie.
-Not you.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.181
Okay. That was you.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.894
But what l really came to talk about
is what l might be feeling.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.272
All humans have feelings.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.567
-You have feelings, too?
-Well, l am a human, am l not?

19:54.151 --> 19:56.319
l'll reserve my answer on that.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.405
Although that is what a cyborg would say.

19:58.489 --> 19:59.531
All right, come on.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.243
Let's cut through all the clinical crap
and talk about what we might be feeling.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.161
Sure. We could do that.

20:05.246 --> 20:10.250
And it may lead to the miracle of love
and unicorns dipped in magic.

20:11.085 --> 20:16.381
Or to the end of our friendship and sex and
everything we currently know and share.

20:17.383 --> 20:21.177
Or we could
slightly modify our relationship,

20:21.762 --> 20:28.226
and l could agree to go to the movies
with you and you could agree to kiss me.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.272
How long do l have to decide?

20:32.815 --> 20:34.900
l mean, l already did,
but l don't want to seem impulsive.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.944
Movies and kissing, final answer.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.406
-l think we can handle this, don't you?
-Yes, l do.

20:41.949 --> 20:45.285
l think all of our years of psychological
training has brought us to this moment.

20:47.622 --> 20:49.331
-May l kiss you now?
-You may.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.096
Wow. l'm ready.
