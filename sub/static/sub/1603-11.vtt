00:01.935 --> 00:03.835
<i> Previously on</i> Empire...
I'm gonna produce an album

00:03.837 --> 00:07.305
spanning your entire
musical career.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.540
We'll call it
<i>Lucious Lyon Legacy.</i>

00:09.542 --> 00:10.607
You put a baby in her.

00:10.609 --> 00:12.875
It was me!
I'm the father of the baby.

00:12.877 --> 00:16.311
No amount of money is gonna
make me go away from Hakeem.

00:16.313 --> 00:17.345
Did she take your money?

00:17.347 --> 00:18.979
What do you think?

00:18.981 --> 00:21.348
I don't pray. Why won't
you just give it a try?

00:21.350 --> 00:23.116
SHAHANI: <i> You know all those
tests</i> <i> that we've been doing?</i>

00:23.118 --> 00:24.784
You got ALS.

00:24.786 --> 00:27.520
You hear me out! 'Cause your
life could depend on it.

00:27.522 --> 00:29.154
Are you threatening me?

00:29.156 --> 00:31.189
Them four dealers you
killed back in the day,

00:31.191 --> 00:32.890
you is a murderer, too.

00:32.892 --> 00:33.891
Take me somewhere with you,
Malcolm.

00:33.893 --> 00:35.659
<i> I want to be alone with you.</i>

00:35.661 --> 00:38.561
What the hell are you here for?
To give me my music back?

00:38.563 --> 00:41.163
Cancel your IPO.
Or what?

00:41.165 --> 00:44.432
I will bury your empire
and everyone in it.

00:46.001 --> 00:48.469
(playing piano)

01:07.088 --> 01:08.822
(echoing, distant):
Hey, boss, can we go over

01:08.824 --> 01:10.523
Hakeem's pre-release party
with Snoop tonight?

01:10.525 --> 01:11.824
Not right now,
I'm writing. Please.

01:11.826 --> 01:13.826
Okay, but when?

01:13.828 --> 01:15.360
Because I really...
Look, I said I am writing

01:15.362 --> 01:16.894
right now, Becky!

01:16.896 --> 01:19.263
You use your inside voice
when you talk to Becky.

01:19.265 --> 01:21.365
(clattering)
MAN: Oh. I'm sorry.

01:21.367 --> 01:24.067
Look, I can't write with all that damn
noise out there! Beat it. Get out of here.

01:24.069 --> 01:26.502
<i> Look, I can't write with all</i>
<i> that damn noise out there!</i>

01:26.504 --> 01:28.904
YOUNG JAMAL:
<i> Ooh, Ma! Ooh!</i>

01:28.906 --> 01:31.239
(siren wailing)
(Lucious playing keyboard)

01:31.241 --> 01:33.574
Ooh, Ma!
Andre cussing again! Ooh!

01:33.576 --> 01:36.209
Look, y'all need to be quiet.
Don't you see your father w...

01:36.211 --> 01:38.277
Hey, don't you see your
father working? Get...!

01:38.279 --> 01:40.712
Damn, baby. What d...
what does it need?

01:40.714 --> 01:42.380
You know, why don't you move
what you just played Y'all move.

01:42.382 --> 01:44.281
to the first four
bars of the verse

01:44.283 --> 01:46.549
and then come up a new hook.
What's wrong with the hook?

01:46.551 --> 01:48.884
I need you to take
these down for me later.

01:48.886 --> 01:51.720
Carol, turn that down.
Turn that down!

02:11.371 --> 02:13.270
Becky!

02:13.272 --> 02:15.705
Yeah. You ready? No, I need you
to get in touch with Cookie.

02:15.707 --> 02:18.374
She helps me when I'm stuck. She's
out of town for the weekend.

02:18.376 --> 02:21.276
Where is she? She didn't say, but
can we please go through this list?

02:21.278 --> 02:24.045
Nobody knows... Okay, okay, look.
I'm gonna introduce Snoop.

02:24.047 --> 02:25.546
I say how excited we are

02:25.548 --> 02:27.981
that he's debuting his new album
with us.

02:27.983 --> 02:29.916
Then Snoop talks about
Hakeem's record dropping

02:29.918 --> 02:32.551
the day the IPO closes,
and then him and Hakeem

02:32.553 --> 02:34.953
do a freestyle, right?

02:49.733 --> 02:51.332
It's your pops.

02:51.334 --> 02:52.399
Tell him to go to hell.

02:52.401 --> 02:54.300
Or wherever he sent Camilla at

02:54.302 --> 02:55.834
with his damn extortion money.

02:55.836 --> 02:57.635
They can burn there together.

02:57.637 --> 02:59.603
LUCIOUS:
<i> Are the boys coming</i>

02:59.605 --> 03:02.005
to Hakeem's thing?
Uh, Jamal has his own

03:02.007 --> 03:04.507
album release events this weekend.
Well, what about Andre?

03:04.509 --> 03:06.509
Uh, he'll be back
at work on Monday.

03:06.511 --> 03:09.512
No, is he coming tonight? Him and Rhonda.
I really...

03:09.514 --> 03:11.547
I really don't think so.

03:15.251 --> 03:19.087
My tribute concert's
in one week, Becky.

03:19.089 --> 03:24.258
It's gonna be billed
as Cookie Lyon Presents

03:24.260 --> 03:26.927
the Lucious Lyon Sound.

03:28.095 --> 03:30.596
Wow.

03:30.598 --> 03:33.432
This is my last show.

03:33.434 --> 03:34.599
Come on. Don't say that.

03:34.601 --> 03:38.436
Well, it is.

03:38.438 --> 03:42.006
That's why I'm trying
to write this amazing song.

03:42.008 --> 03:45.676
I want to perform it in front
of a packed stadium

03:45.678 --> 03:49.279
on the day
that Empire goes public.

03:49.281 --> 03:50.847
It's got to be epic.

03:50.849 --> 03:52.348
It's got to be
like a supernova.

03:52.350 --> 03:54.983
That's how I want to go out.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.418
Epic.

04:00.355 --> 04:03.023
I need Cookie.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.392
You got to find me Cookie.

04:22.709 --> 04:25.711
Whoa.
This is really beautiful.

04:25.713 --> 04:26.712
Hmm.

04:26.714 --> 04:28.480
Whose place is this?

04:28.482 --> 04:30.882
This is my buddy's
from Iraq.

04:30.884 --> 04:34.719
I told him I was bringing a very
special lady here this weekend.

04:34.721 --> 04:36.554
You did, did you?

04:36.556 --> 04:38.389
Yeah. Hmm.

04:38.391 --> 04:40.456
(chuckles)
Mmm.

04:42.392 --> 04:44.092
Let's go inside.
Yeah.

04:44.094 --> 04:46.227
We can make a snowman.
Ooh, yeah.

04:46.229 --> 04:48.762
But I'm not trying
to do that, honey.

04:48.764 --> 04:50.530
This is going to be crazy.

04:50.532 --> 04:53.432
Every artist that Lucious
has ever worked with

04:53.434 --> 04:55.500
wants to be on
this damn bill.

04:55.502 --> 04:57.835
T.I. just hit me up-- he wants
to do "Come Away with Me."

04:57.837 --> 05:00.537
It's gonna be hot. It's the
biggest thing I've ever done.

05:00.539 --> 05:02.205
My name's on it, you know?

05:02.207 --> 05:05.208
Cookie Lyon Presents.

05:05.210 --> 05:08.277
Do you think, uh,
Cookie Lyon Presents would like

05:08.279 --> 05:09.878
to take a little break with me?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.546
Huh?
Come here.

05:11.548 --> 05:13.247
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

05:13.249 --> 05:15.115
(sighs)

05:15.117 --> 05:17.784
Yeah, whole lot of hard work.
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

05:17.786 --> 05:21.120
No. There's nothing to
be sorry about. Okay.

05:21.122 --> 05:23.555
Are you nervous?
Me?

05:23.557 --> 05:25.189
Hell, no. Shoot.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.024
(chuckles)

05:28.893 --> 05:32.195
It's just that I haven't been
with anybody but Lucious.

05:32.197 --> 05:33.429
Are you serious?

05:33.431 --> 05:34.863
Yeah.
(chuckles)

05:36.465 --> 05:38.833
That's beautiful.

05:43.638 --> 05:45.138
I tell you what...

05:45.140 --> 05:47.573

Yeah, beyond this stupid
double vision.

06:59.101 --> 07:01.267
Becky, where's Ryan? You're early. I
thought you wanted to rest a while.

07:01.269 --> 07:03.869
No, I can rest when I'm dead-- I
got to get this party over with

07:03.871 --> 07:05.971
and get back to writing
my song.

07:05.973 --> 07:08.273
I need him to shoot my
documentary-- find him.

07:08.275 --> 07:10.608
Actually, he's with
Jamal tonight.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.276

How you doing? Thank you so much.
My-my brother loves

07:29.960 --> 07:32.293
your music. He's a huge fan.
Aw, that's dope.

07:32.295 --> 07:34.495
So this is for your brother.
What's-what's your name, man?

07:34.497 --> 07:37.965
I'm Zack. No. I-I just...
I wanted to tell you,

07:37.967 --> 07:40.300
um, that you coming out,

07:40.302 --> 07:43.403
that gave me the courage
to come out to my brother.

07:43.405 --> 07:46.872
ZACK: It was really cool of you,
man-- his name's Joe.

07:46.874 --> 07:48.073
I'm Zack.

07:48.075 --> 07:49.507
Thank you, man. I...

07:49.509 --> 07:51.008
Really, I appreciate that.

07:51.010 --> 07:53.010
Thank you.
Good for you. Yeah.

07:53.012 --> 07:57.380
Thank you. This is great.
Right on, man.

07:57.382 --> 08:00.316
So, um... Joe and Zack.

08:00.318 --> 08:02.885
Y'all, thank you.
Really.

08:02.887 --> 08:04.920
That was something special.
Crazy.

08:04.922 --> 08:08.056
Amazing. Um, you can go
to Hakeem's thing.

08:08.058 --> 08:09.524
I'm not gonna hold it
against you.

08:09.526 --> 08:11.259
I know Lucious is paying
you a lot of money.

08:11.261 --> 08:13.794
Ah... Not after
what he did to you.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.562
How you doing?
What's your name?

08:20.232 --> 08:22.534
I'm really concerned
about Jamal and Hakeem.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.135
Mmm.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.703
They're supposed
to cover their dad's song,

08:25.705 --> 08:28.272
"What the DJ Spins,"
but they're both so mad at him.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.440
Yeah. I don't blame them.

08:30.442 --> 08:33.276
I don't blame Jamal.
Hakeem's better off

08:33.278 --> 08:35.511
without that
money-grubbing bitch.

08:35.513 --> 08:39.781
Oh, Camilla-- she didn't
take Lucious's money.

08:40.716 --> 08:42.316
What?

08:42.318 --> 08:44.151
But did he tell
you she did?

08:44.153 --> 08:49.155
Oh, God, I wish he would
just drop dead already.

08:49.157 --> 08:52.558
Then we can make it
a memorial concert,

08:52.560 --> 08:56.128
jack up the ticket prices
really high. (chuckles)

09:00.733 --> 09:03.501
So, Snoop, after your last
album, you had a bitter split

09:03.503 --> 09:05.503
with your label and said
you were going indie.

09:05.505 --> 09:07.872
What made you decide
to do a joint venture

09:07.874 --> 09:09.907
with Empire for
your new album,<i> Bush?</i>

09:09.909 --> 09:12.542
Double L, man-- Lucious Lyon,
the man, the myth,

09:12.544 --> 09:14.410
the legend right here.
And let's just say that, uh,

09:14.412 --> 09:17.746
Lucious cut me in
on a piece of the action.

09:17.748 --> 09:19.647
(all laughing)
I mean, that's the whole reason

09:19.649 --> 09:21.181
I'm taking Empire public.

09:21.183 --> 09:24.184
It's so that my artists
can share in the wealth.

09:24.186 --> 09:27.187
This is the age
of social justice.

09:27.189 --> 09:29.522
Like my man Jay Z said,

09:29.524 --> 09:31.156
"We gonna make 'em pay
for what they did

09:31.158 --> 09:32.590
to Cold Crush
back in the day."

09:32.592 --> 09:34.825
And wait till you hear
Snoop's new one,

09:34.827 --> 09:37.394
"Peaches and Cream," honey.

09:37.396 --> 09:39.362
Titan!
My brother.

09:39.364 --> 09:42.064
Hakeem Lyon's album

09:42.066 --> 09:44.833
debuts the day
that Empire goes public,

09:44.835 --> 09:46.835
and in a moment,
you're gonna meet the man

09:46.837 --> 09:49.370
I expect
to take over Empire one day.

09:49.372 --> 09:51.205
(quietly): Where is he?
I don't know.

09:51.207 --> 09:52.439
WOMAN:
Tonight you're touting

09:52.441 --> 09:53.940
your son Hakeem's
upcoming release,

09:53.942 --> 09:55.675
but your son Jamal
already dropped an album.

09:55.677 --> 09:57.343
What are your thoughts about it?

09:57.345 --> 09:58.610
Well, you said it best
when you said

09:58.612 --> 10:00.745
tonight we're talking
about Hakeem.

10:00.747 --> 10:02.213
WOMAN 2:<i> The Source </i>
compared him to you.

10:02.215 --> 10:04.782
And I quote, "Jamal Lyon's
memorable verses

10:04.784 --> 10:07.684
"and elegant riffs might
actually surpass what was known

10:07.686 --> 10:09.285
back in the day
as the Lucious Lyon Sound."

10:09.287 --> 10:11.954
Baby, you're not gonna
divide and conquer with me.

10:11.956 --> 10:14.456
(all laughing) Look,
next week, I'm performing

10:14.458 --> 10:17.025
at the Mercury Arena,
and I'm-a blow your mind.

10:17.027 --> 10:18.593
The day that Empire becomes

10:18.595 --> 10:21.429
the first black-owned
entertainment company

10:21.431 --> 10:24.298
to be publicly traded
on the New York Stock Exchange,

10:24.300 --> 10:28.135
I'm going to show you the
brand-new Lucious Lyon Sound,

10:28.137 --> 10:30.137
and I'm inviting you
to be there personally,

10:30.139 --> 10:33.140
so you can witness as
Empire becomes synonymous

10:33.142 --> 10:34.774
with American culture

10:34.776 --> 10:37.943
and Lucious Lyon
becomes a god.

10:37.945 --> 10:39.978
(applause, cheering)

10:39.980 --> 10:41.245
Well, if he's God,

10:41.247 --> 10:42.713
I must be Jesus.

10:42.715 --> 10:44.381
Mr. Lyon.

10:44.383 --> 10:46.583
What's this?
A legal notice.

10:46.585 --> 10:48.384
Thank you very much.
Get him out of here.

10:49.486 --> 10:51.553
It's an injunction.

10:51.555 --> 10:54.289
Beretti's trying to
sabotage the concert.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.491
Where's Malcolm?

10:56.493 --> 10:58.125
He's in the Berkshires
for the long weekend, sir.

10:58.127 --> 10:59.493
He cleared it with you.

10:59.495 --> 11:01.994
(sighs)

11:03.896 --> 11:06.363
Hakeem!

11:07.798 --> 11:10.232

LUCIOUS:
Hakeem!

13:57.864 --> 13:59.231

Oh, man!

(Hakeem panting)

14:01.468 --> 14:02.934
Dang.

14:02.936 --> 14:05.002
Dude.

14:18.950 --> 14:21.584
JAMAL: Ah, man, this is harsh.
I got problems

14:21.586 --> 14:23.452
with Lucious, too, but...
But what?

14:23.454 --> 14:24.586
He's dying.

14:24.588 --> 14:26.588
Sooner the better.

14:26.590 --> 14:28.156
I hate his ass.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.957
Mal, if you don't,
you're a fool.

14:29.959 --> 14:31.391
I'm over it.
Really?

14:31.393 --> 14:32.658
Yes.

14:32.660 --> 14:34.559
It's, like,
welcome to my world.

14:34.561 --> 14:35.927
Let's run it back.

14:35.929 --> 14:37.662
So, Lucious

14:37.664 --> 14:41.298
made me marry Olivia,
and then he slept with her.

14:41.300 --> 14:44.668
And then, let him tell it,
he impregnated her,

14:44.670 --> 14:47.637
and let me believe
that Lola was mine.

14:47.639 --> 14:52.274
So, yes, we have issues
with him, but about Empire--

14:52.276 --> 14:55.010
I want the company
to be around when he's not.

14:55.012 --> 14:56.978
And your album, fool.
You can't just walk away.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.646
I'm not walking away.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.147
I'm just going to
a different label.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.748
No, you're not.
You can't do that.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.182
Yes, I can.

15:03.184 --> 15:05.017
I never signed any contracts.

15:05.019 --> 15:06.852
And he think he own us.

15:06.854 --> 15:09.487
Well, guess what? He don't.

15:14.925 --> 15:16.659
Oh, my God, he always
doing something-- mm!

15:16.661 --> 15:18.827
(knocking on door)

15:18.829 --> 15:20.128
Where the hell is Cookie?

15:20.130 --> 15:21.529
She's not answering
any of my calls.

15:21.531 --> 15:23.964
Cookie on her way back
from the Berkshires.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.366
(echoing, distorted): She's supposed
to be picking up her sister Carol

15:26.368 --> 15:28.368
from Penn Station, so she
should be back no later

15:28.370 --> 15:29.769
than this afternoon,
this evening.

15:29.771 --> 15:31.704
Cookie's in the Berkshires?

15:31.706 --> 15:34.840
Oh... Oh, I mean... no, I just
said that for instance.

15:34.842 --> 15:37.309
You know, she...
I don't know where she at.

15:37.311 --> 15:40.545
Hell, I don't know nothing.
I ain't know nothing since Y2K.

15:40.547 --> 15:41.779

That's the song.
Mm-hmm.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.102
Give me a second.
Yeah, no problem.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.037
Hey.

16:12.039 --> 16:15.240
Hey... Um...

16:15.242 --> 16:17.475
I tried to go back
to work this morning.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.843
I couldn't do it.

16:18.845 --> 16:22.980
Sometimes it's hard to go back.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.682
Don't judge yourself.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.118
I feel like nothing
fits anymore.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.955
You know, this suit and tie,
these shoes-- nothing fits.

16:31.957 --> 16:37.393
Well, maybe God is telling you
to try on something else.

16:39.095 --> 16:44.599
Come on, let me show you
my church. Come on.

16:44.601 --> 16:46.667
COOKIE:
<i> Come on, let me show you</i>

16:46.669 --> 16:48.135
your sister's empire.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.870
This is corporate
headquarters.

16:49.872 --> 16:53.139
My office is here,
Andre's, Lucious's.

16:53.141 --> 16:54.773
Dang.

16:54.775 --> 16:57.609
Girl, this sure is a step up
from my living room

16:57.611 --> 17:00.111
when you and Lucious
made that first record.

17:00.113 --> 17:03.881
Yeah, and it's all mine, baby,
as soon as that IPO closes.

17:03.883 --> 17:07.484
You want to know why I put
my name on that concert?

17:07.486 --> 17:10.787
Because Hell wants the Devil
back, and Lucious is on his way.

17:10.789 --> 17:12.155
Yeah.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.023
This concert makes me
the new face of Empire

17:14.025 --> 17:15.657
while I build Jamal up.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.992
All right now. Now, we going
to your marketing meeting,

17:17.994 --> 17:19.526
and then we gonna hit Laviticus...
Yes.

17:19.528 --> 17:20.827
...for Jamal's listening
party, right?

17:20.829 --> 17:21.961
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Okay.

17:21.963 --> 17:23.195
Now, now, now, now, look,

17:23.197 --> 17:25.664
check out this fancy-ass
security system.

17:25.666 --> 17:27.799
That's all Malcolm, baby.
He did that.

17:27.801 --> 17:29.667
Oh.
You'll meet him soon enough.

17:29.669 --> 17:31.135
(beeping)
We got to get that fixed.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.569
But look here, keep
that on the down-low.

17:32.571 --> 17:34.571
All right?
On the hush.

17:34.573 --> 17:37.240
You know, ain't nobody supposed
to know about that. No, I got you.

17:37.242 --> 17:40.209
You and soldier boy goin'... Hey,
man, didn't I tell you to be quiet?

17:40.211 --> 17:42.377
Can I have your key card,
please, Mrs. Lyon?

17:42.379 --> 17:46.246
Yeah, okay, well, just make sure
you get a new one in my office.

17:46.248 --> 17:47.847
Now, I got a meeting to go...

17:47.849 --> 17:49.815
We've been instructed not
to let you in, Mrs. Lyon.

17:49.817 --> 17:51.917
What?  We've been
instructed not...

17:51.919 --> 17:53.485
I... I heard
what you said.

17:53.487 --> 17:56.554
So you not gonna
let me in my office?

17:56.556 --> 17:58.022
I'm not going nowhere

17:58.024 --> 17:59.723
until Lucious come down here
and talk to me.

17:59.725 --> 18:02.092
Here he is-- Lucious,
what you doing?

18:02.094 --> 18:03.359
You can't lock me out.

18:03.361 --> 18:04.360
I already did.

18:04.362 --> 18:05.661
So nice to see you, Carol.

18:05.663 --> 18:07.062
Welcome to New York.
(scoffs)

18:07.064 --> 18:08.496
Enjoy your visit.

18:08.498 --> 18:10.264
Leave the premises, Cookie.

18:10.266 --> 18:12.065
No.

18:12.067 --> 18:14.067
You expecting
your little boyfriend

18:14.069 --> 18:15.601
to come running
to your rescue?

18:15.603 --> 18:16.702
You're out of here.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.203
Oh, is that what
this is about?

18:18.205 --> 18:19.837
No, you're out of here.
You're jealous?

18:19.839 --> 18:22.172
You're jealous, Lucious,
for real, after everything

18:22.174 --> 18:23.606
you've done?

18:23.608 --> 18:24.940
You think you still own me?

18:24.942 --> 18:26.374
You are sick.

18:26.376 --> 18:28.576
Now, you are not a part
of my company,

18:28.578 --> 18:30.077
and my attorneys
have assured me

18:30.079 --> 18:32.746
I don't owe you
a damn thing-- now leave.

18:32.748 --> 18:34.347
Yeah, well, you can't do that.

18:34.349 --> 18:36.349
I am the board of directors.

18:36.351 --> 18:38.584
You were never on the board.

18:38.586 --> 18:39.684
What?

18:39.686 --> 18:42.220
Andre knew, the day that
he made that deal with you,

18:42.222 --> 18:44.388
that a convicted felon
can never serve

18:44.390 --> 18:48.124
on the board of a
publicly traded company.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.292
Nice boy, huh?

18:50.294 --> 18:51.760
Are you gonna leave on your own,

18:51.762 --> 18:53.561
or do I have to escort you?
Sorry, Carol.

18:53.563 --> 18:56.030
You're on
a dark path, Lucious.

18:56.032 --> 18:59.466
You're going down.

18:59.468 --> 19:03.102
I'm not gonna let you take
my company with you.

19:03.104 --> 19:05.771
17 years, bitch.

19:05.773 --> 19:07.072
Get off of me.

19:07.074 --> 19:08.973
Everybody's just waiting

19:08.975 --> 19:10.407
for you to die, Lucious.

19:10.409 --> 19:12.609
You gonna die

19:12.611 --> 19:15.812
a lonely man,
just like you deserve.

19:15.814 --> 19:18.047
You gonna need Cookie.

19:18.049 --> 19:19.481
Watch what I say.

19:19.483 --> 19:21.850

something missing, Dad--

22:13.350 --> 22:16.850
a void that I filled
with darkness.

22:18.252 --> 22:21.854
But now I'm getting
to know my God

22:21.856 --> 22:24.423

31:26.326 --> 31:27.591
Now I got a song!

31:27.593 --> 31:29.225
It's not your song.

31:29.227 --> 31:30.659
What? I'm gonna give you
your credit, man.

31:30.661 --> 31:32.961
You're gonna get
your publishing on this.

31:32.963 --> 31:34.329
And then I get to perform
it when you're dead?

31:34.331 --> 31:36.664
Naw, son.

31:36.666 --> 31:38.999
Cookie Lyon Presents
the Lucious Lyon Sound.

31:39.001 --> 31:40.600
That was the agreement.

31:40.602 --> 31:43.002
What? You think
your work is done?

31:44.170 --> 31:46.804
I need you to get
my masters back

31:46.806 --> 31:48.739
from Beretti.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.107
Then we got a deal.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.241
No.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.076
That's over, anyway.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.445
If-if Vernon and the lawyers
couldn't do it, what makes you

31:55.447 --> 31:57.013
think I'm gonna be...?
Do you want Empire

31:57.015 --> 31:59.716
or don't you?

31:59.718 --> 32:01.384
'Cause if you want it,

32:01.386 --> 32:03.386
you got to be willing
to take it

32:03.388 --> 32:05.521
to where they can't take it.

32:06.756 --> 32:10.358
Otherwise...

32:10.360 --> 32:12.593
there won't be an Empire

32:12.595 --> 32:15.262
for you to lead.

32:15.264 --> 32:16.329
Lucious!

32:17.264 --> 32:18.597
Lucious!

32:18.599 --> 32:21.466
CAROL:
This place is a damn mansion!

32:21.468 --> 32:23.367
Lucious!

32:23.369 --> 32:24.768
Kill his ass.

32:24.770 --> 32:26.636
(sighs happily)

32:26.638 --> 32:29.205
Come on, Cookie, will you
please get over yourself?

32:29.207 --> 32:31.073
Where is he?
I mean, come on.

32:31.075 --> 32:32.707
You did 17 years in the Fed.

32:32.709 --> 32:34.975
So now you trying to tell me
you can't deal

32:34.977 --> 32:36.943
with Lucious for three years
or less until he drop dead?

32:36.945 --> 32:38.244
I'm sick of you.
What's wro...?

32:38.246 --> 32:39.745
All you think about is mo...

32:39.747 --> 32:41.747
Look, I'm so glad you're here.

32:41.749 --> 32:44.482
Carol, wow, you look lovely.

32:45.650 --> 32:47.083
Lucious, what the
hell is wrong?

32:47.085 --> 32:48.217
Look, let me talk, all right?

32:48.219 --> 32:49.751
I just wanted to say I may have

32:49.753 --> 32:51.953
overreacted earlier.
You think?

32:51.955 --> 32:54.622
And I've decided
to let you produce the concert,

32:54.624 --> 32:56.890
and it'll say
Cookie Lyon Presents...

32:56.892 --> 32:58.892
What the hell is this?

32:58.894 --> 33:01.628
I got a text from Jamal saying
he's on his way to Hakeem's

33:01.630 --> 33:02.962
to make a move on Beretti.

33:04.731 --> 33:06.898
Hakeem's meeting with Beretti?

33:06.900 --> 33:08.633
Uh, yeah.

33:08.635 --> 33:11.569
Beretti's trying to get your
son to sign to Creedmoor.

33:11.571 --> 33:14.572
And Hakeem is doing it to
get back at you, dumb-ass.

33:14.574 --> 33:16.073
Look, we're gonna have
to talk tomorrow.

33:16.075 --> 33:17.407
Okay?

33:17.409 --> 33:18.775
Juanita!

33:18.777 --> 33:20.977
Have Gary bring
the damn car around.

33:20.979 --> 33:23.980

BERETTI: Unlike Empire,
we at Creedmoor believe

33:31.488 --> 33:33.821
making music should be fun.

33:33.823 --> 33:35.522
(chuckles)

33:35.524 --> 33:36.689
I can get with that.

33:36.691 --> 33:38.357
Chicken.
(groans)

33:38.359 --> 33:40.025
Where's my brother?

33:44.029 --> 33:46.430
Jamal Lyon.

33:46.432 --> 33:48.432
Billy Beretti.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

33:48.434 --> 33:50.534
I'm a huge fan of your music.
Mr. Beretti,

33:50.536 --> 33:51.768
it's a pleasure to meet you.

33:51.770 --> 33:53.002
I hear that, uh,
you and my brother

33:53.004 --> 33:54.303
might be doing
business together.

33:54.305 --> 33:56.038
That's right.
All right, all right.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.272
Can we, um, talk outside?

33:57.274 --> 33:59.774
Sure.
All right.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.509
What the hell?!

34:01.511 --> 34:02.543
(shouting)

34:02.545 --> 34:03.777
Chicken, back me up!

34:05.212 --> 34:06.912
Get the contracts
and the pen out of my bag.

34:08.347 --> 34:09.680
We're talking about the masters

34:09.682 --> 34:10.947
that you stole from my father.

34:10.949 --> 34:12.048
I want them back.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.249
LUCIOUS:
Jamal!

34:15.652 --> 34:16.952
Oh, hey, look--
we told him to stop.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.553
Come on, Lucious.
Shut up!

34:18.555 --> 34:20.187
Dad, you shouldn't be here
right now.

34:20.189 --> 34:21.855
(panting)

34:21.857 --> 34:23.890
You go get Hakeem, a'ight?

34:25.659 --> 34:27.159
What the hell is wrong
with you?!

34:27.161 --> 34:29.728
Come on.
Give 'em a little privacy.

34:29.730 --> 34:32.130
You will sign this contract

34:32.132 --> 34:33.798
turning over the rights
to Lucious Lyon's masters

34:33.800 --> 34:35.332
in perpetuity,
do you understand me?

34:35.334 --> 34:37.534
You're not gonna drop me.

34:37.536 --> 34:40.003
My daddy thinks I will.

34:40.005 --> 34:42.205
No!

34:42.207 --> 34:44.273
He thinks I'm a killer.

34:46.976 --> 34:49.276
I think he's right.

34:50.711 --> 34:53.278
(Anika laughing)

34:56.248 --> 34:58.949
LUCIOUS:
Anika.

35:09.260 --> 35:11.728
DR. SHAHANI: MG and ALS are
very different, Lucious,

35:11.730 --> 35:14.731
but they both have quite a few
symptoms that mirror each other.

35:14.733 --> 35:16.265
The eye muscle weakness

35:16.267 --> 35:18.600
that caused your
parallel vision,

35:18.602 --> 35:20.368
<i> that only happens with MG.</i>

35:20.370 --> 35:24.337
It's very astute
of your nurse.

35:24.339 --> 35:28.039
So I don't have ALS.

35:28.041 --> 35:29.707
I'm sorry, Lucious.

35:29.709 --> 35:31.842
You know, ALS is
largely diagnosed

35:31.844 --> 35:33.243
by eliminating
other conditions.

35:33.245 --> 35:35.411
There's no specific
blood test,

35:35.413 --> 35:39.281
<i> there's no scan...</i> <i> I need
one of you Negroes</i> <i> to man up.</i>

35:39.283 --> 35:42.183
This thing I have,

35:42.185 --> 35:44.552
it's not as serious.

35:44.554 --> 35:45.719
What's it called?

35:45.721 --> 35:48.521
Myasthenia gravis.

35:48.523 --> 35:52.257
It's a chronic
but highly treatable condition.

35:54.059 --> 35:57.428
And you didn't test me for it?

35:57.430 --> 35:59.496
After everything I said...

36:45.102 --> 36:46.334

36:46.336 --> 36:48.135
Getting you

36:54.942 --> 36:58.410
to ring the opening bell

36:58.412 --> 37:01.579
next week-- I mean,
it's the announcement that

37:01.581 --> 37:04.782
Empire is officially starting
to trade.

37:04.784 --> 37:07.084
I'm hoping that you and Jamal
will stand on either side...

37:07.086 --> 37:08.484
What about Hakeem?

37:11.020 --> 37:13.755
I was thinking
that you should be

37:13.757 --> 37:15.456
the one to ring that bell, son.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.324
Yeah, no thanks.
We got a bell here.

37:17.326 --> 37:19.125
Look, everything's changed
with me.

37:19.127 --> 37:21.293
I'm gonna tell you more
about it later,

37:21.295 --> 37:24.796
but right now, I need you...

37:24.798 --> 37:26.664

Oh, my God, thank you.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.268
God bless you.

39:02.472 --> 39:04.673
So we'll be doing
these injections regularly

39:04.675 --> 39:06.141
to help manage
the neuromuscular symptoms.

39:06.143 --> 39:09.344
So you mean I won't have
any more tremors?

39:09.346 --> 39:10.878
In a couple weeks,

39:10.880 --> 39:12.846
you could be tremor-free.

39:12.848 --> 39:15.815
Dr. S. also prescribed
that sedative.

39:15.817 --> 39:20.285
Cortical steroids can cause
extreme insomnia,

39:20.287 --> 39:22.153
but I'd wait until you're ready
to go to bed to take those.

39:22.155 --> 39:23.621
They're pretty strong.

39:23.623 --> 39:26.490

Hmm?

39:45.805 --> 39:47.304
Mm...

39:47.306 --> 39:49.339
Asleep already, huh?

39:49.341 --> 39:51.341
He said you took some pills.

39:51.343 --> 39:53.409
(muttering groggily)

39:57.046 --> 39:58.646
If you weren't
already dying, Lucious,

39:58.648 --> 40:01.015
I swear I'd kill your ass.

40:01.017 --> 40:02.850
What were you thinking,

40:02.852 --> 40:05.319
making Jamal do your dirty work?

40:05.321 --> 40:08.555
Do you know he almost dropped
that man off the balcony?

40:08.557 --> 40:10.890
What is this, Lucious?

40:10.892 --> 40:12.825
Your family members go to jail,

40:12.827 --> 40:14.526
but you get to stay out free

40:14.528 --> 40:16.261
so you can do your little music?

40:16.263 --> 40:18.830
Get off my bed!
Get away from me.

40:18.832 --> 40:20.731
I'm not on your bed.
I ain't going with you.

40:20.733 --> 40:22.199
I'm not going with you.

40:26.905 --> 40:29.905

40:31.407 --> 40:32.840
I'm here to take you out.

40:32.842 --> 40:34.274
No, Bunkie, go on, man.

40:34.276 --> 40:35.508
Bunkie?!

40:35.510 --> 40:36.709
What the hell

40:36.711 --> 40:38.177
kind of drugs are you taking?

40:39.345 --> 40:41.346
You can't be here, man.

40:41.348 --> 40:43.581
I killed your ass.

40:43.583 --> 40:46.283
Just like Shine's boys.

40:46.285 --> 40:48.752
You kept threatening me
with the Wisemen.

40:48.754 --> 40:51.421
What did you say, Lucious?

40:51.423 --> 40:54.690
Everybody that crosses me dies.

40:54.692 --> 40:56.391
Everybody.

40:56.393 --> 40:58.626
And y'all can't kill me.
