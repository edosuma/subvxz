WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.703
Narrator: Last time
on Make It Pop.

00:02.736 --> 00:04.004
I got demoted
from the play.

00:04.038 --> 00:04.972
Have you seen Jodi?

00:05.005 --> 00:05.473
How come?

00:05.506 --> 00:06.707
No reason.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.476
People aren't talking about me,
they're talking about you.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.310
I've been out webbed.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.378
Here's your study
advisor now.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.079
You?

00:11.112 --> 00:12.080
You!

00:12.113 --> 00:13.314
You're all going to take
a back seat to Corki.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.583
We don't need them,
we have each other.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.825
Don't worry.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.560
It's going to be okay.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.597
Jealousy is the kind of reaction
you have to get used to

00:29.630 --> 00:30.598
when you're a
leading actor.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.434
I don't think this is a
very good idea Jared.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.868
It's a great idea.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.471
My play is a completely
original interpretation.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.408
"Original interpretation"
is an oxymoron.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.144
Exactly...

00:43.177 --> 00:44.978
Okay...

00:45.012 --> 00:47.581
My friend could be
good to cast, you know,

00:47.615 --> 00:48.182
Sun Hi--

00:48.216 --> 00:50.751
A-ttttaaaa. Shhhhh.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.521
I'm having an aha moment.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.790
Jodi: Jared re-cast
the whole play?

00:56.824 --> 00:59.827
Yeah, and I'm
still not in it!

00:59.860 --> 01:01.695
He's lost his
mind, Sun Hi Nation.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.031
I know you're solid
with me on this one.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.468
I think he's just
expressing his creativity.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.702
I play a shoe cobbler?

01:08.736 --> 01:09.937
I'm a talking hot
air balloon...

01:09.970 --> 01:14.175
There's a definite limit to how
creative a person should be.

01:14.208 --> 01:18.446
He changed Toto to a
dancing Great Dane.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.948
Can a Great Dane dance?

01:20.981 --> 01:22.183
This could be good.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.619
If Jared's redoing the play,
then maybe I can convince him

01:25.653 --> 01:27.221
to let me do the
costume design.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.522
Really?

01:28.556 --> 01:30.158
The play's in just
over a week.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.759
He's gonna
need help.

01:31.792 --> 01:35.062
You could get your
music in there, too.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.698
Caleb, you're staring.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.066
Was I staring?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.134
No, I wasn't.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.736
There's something is going
on here and the Nation,

01:42.770 --> 01:44.772
and I don't like it.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.507
Mostly because
I'm not involved.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.142
Tell me what it is!

01:48.176 --> 01:50.544
Nothing!

01:50.578 --> 01:52.846
There's electricity
between you.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.516
And I thought it was because
someone was wearing wool.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.950
What electricity? /I'm allergic
to wool!

01:56.984 --> 01:58.986
We totally said
that at the same time.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.488
Yeah.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.824
What are the chances?

02:03.857 --> 02:04.992
Are they a couple?

02:09.630 --> 02:11.665
Too weird/ Ewww!

02:11.699 --> 02:12.533
Crazy talk.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.033
No...

02:14.902 --> 02:15.869
Sun Hi: Mr. Stark?

02:15.903 --> 02:18.038
Are you in there?

02:22.910 --> 02:25.846
Mr. Stark?

02:25.879 --> 02:26.814
Are you okay?

02:26.847 --> 02:27.615
Never better.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.183
I have a thousand
online friends.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.719
That's like an electronic
standing ovation.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.654
I'm a web star!

02:33.687 --> 02:35.256
How's that possible?

02:35.289 --> 02:36.857
The vlog I did about him.

02:36.890 --> 02:37.991
People loved it.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.993
They also love a
cat playing a piano.

02:40.027 --> 02:40.828
That was great.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.197
I want to do a
song with that cat.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.299
Anyway, my vlog
went viral and

02:45.333 --> 02:48.669
now he has friends in
eighty seven countries.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.303
Eighty-eight.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.271
Hello Fiji!

02:50.304 --> 02:52.540
Ha-ha!

02:52.573 --> 02:54.208
Maybe I can
go viral too.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.009
I need that piano
playing cat.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.217
Sun Hi, Jared's going
to alienate everyone!

03:03.251 --> 03:05.886
We need Mr. Stark to
take back the play!

03:05.919 --> 03:07.288
You have to fix this!

03:09.823 --> 03:12.993
* Make it pop, woo, woo

03:13.026 --> 03:15.796
* Make it pop, woo

03:15.829 --> 03:20.133
* Woo, I can't wait,
no I can't wait no *

03:20.167 --> 03:23.003
* I can't wait,
no I can't wait *

03:23.036 --> 03:26.607
* So make it pop, we're bout
to, we're bout to blow *

03:26.640 --> 03:29.943
* Wait till we drop,
Oh ya, we're ready to go *

03:29.977 --> 03:33.146
* Ain't gonna stop, when
is it time for the show *

03:33.180 --> 03:35.949
* We make it, you make
it, they make it *

03:35.983 --> 03:38.686
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

03:40.388 --> 03:41.455
*

03:41.489 --> 03:42.423
Ms. Hurley: Tomorrow
will be a quiz on

03:42.456 --> 03:45.693
acts one and two of
Shakespeare's Macbeth.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.361
And just like in
the play where

03:47.395 --> 03:50.331
unexpected things
happen at every turn,

03:50.364 --> 03:53.667
the quiz will be
equally unpredictable.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.770
Blah blah blah you
all get my drift.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.372
That's that kind of
positive re enforcement

03:58.406 --> 04:02.042
that makes me
love my job.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.077
I think I'm going
to be sick tomorrow.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.178
How do you know?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.915
Because she hasn't read
acts one and two of Macbeth.

04:07.948 --> 04:08.616
Don't worry.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.483
I'm reviewing them right now.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.319
We can have an
all-night study session.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.220
It'll be so much fun!

04:13.253 --> 04:15.022
I'd rather be sick.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.257
Jared: Corki!

04:17.291 --> 04:18.659
Corki!

04:18.692 --> 04:19.793
You...

04:19.827 --> 04:21.329
You...

04:21.362 --> 04:22.763
You...

04:22.796 --> 04:24.365
* Youuuuu!

04:24.398 --> 04:25.065
Sun Hi: Hey!

04:25.098 --> 04:26.767
Why wasn't I
cast as Dorothy?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.169
Because I have a vision
and you're not in it.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.170
What?

04:30.203 --> 04:32.973
Sun Hi is the vision.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.777
I'm out.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.679
Come on Jodi.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.285
You want me to
be Dorothy?

04:45.319 --> 04:47.721
Oh no, that's
old school.

04:47.755 --> 04:51.692
My Oz, will be a brilliant
exposÃ© of human creativity.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.661
And I owe it all to you!

04:53.694 --> 04:54.795
Me?

04:54.828 --> 04:55.596
Yes!

04:55.629 --> 04:57.765
You're my inspiration,
my muse --

04:57.798 --> 05:00.968
you were right, by the way,
that is exactly how you say it.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.203
Have you run all of
this by Mr. Stark?

05:03.236 --> 05:05.138
He doesn't get
me, Corki.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.808
My Oz is subversive.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.142
The Munchkins
are an allegory

05:09.176 --> 05:12.279
for the little guys' fight
against big business.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.214
And who's there to save them?

05:14.247 --> 05:15.416
The Cowardly Lion!

05:15.449 --> 05:20.754
But now she's a bald eagle
soaring majestically over Oz!

05:20.788 --> 05:21.722
Breathe, Jared.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.891
This doesn't make
any sense.

05:23.924 --> 05:28.429
Wait -- this play has to
have a troll prince in it.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.731
Oh you've done
it again, muse!

05:32.032 --> 05:40.474
*

05:40.508 --> 05:42.342
Jodi! I'm sorry!

05:42.376 --> 05:46.279
Not for kissing you the
other day, no I liked that.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.081
But for running into you!

05:48.115 --> 05:48.816
Shhhh.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.751
What?

05:50.784 --> 05:51.485
Oh, sorry...

05:51.519 --> 05:52.720
Sorry.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.721
About the other day...

05:53.754 --> 05:55.489
We should probably
talk about what happened.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.691
Okay...

06:01.061 --> 06:02.029
No band practice
tonight.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.063
Corki can't make it.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.064
Okay, good.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.233
That means I can work
on my beats for Jared.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.036
And I can work on my new
sketches for the costumes.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.838
We can present music
and wardrobe together!

06:10.871 --> 06:16.844
There's no way he could
say no to this team!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.512
You guys look weird.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.914
Like a dentist
commercial.

06:20.948 --> 06:21.815
What's going on?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.451
Corki can't make it
to band practice.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.585
She's stuck at
play rehearsal.

06:24.618 --> 06:27.521
So we're going to work on
costumes, music and stuff.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.889
See you later!

06:28.922 --> 06:33.461
But we can still
rehearse...

06:33.494 --> 06:36.129
At least I still
have you, celly.

06:36.163 --> 06:36.930
What?!

06:36.964 --> 06:38.766
Dead battery?!

06:38.799 --> 06:40.834
I can't count on
anyone in this world.

06:42.836 --> 06:47.875
Dear Starkhead394, yes all
six of my Broadway plays

06:47.908 --> 06:50.343
opened and closed
on the same night.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.380
But that just allowed me
to keep the work fresh!

06:56.450 --> 06:58.351
Making new friends,
Mr. Stark?

06:58.385 --> 07:01.922
Yes the online community
has wrapped me in a warm,

07:01.955 --> 07:04.792
pixelated embrace.

07:04.825 --> 07:05.793
Who's this?

07:05.826 --> 07:06.494
Hans.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.061
I've cast him in
the musical.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.262
Oh um.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.464
Bold choice.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.366
Like the time I cast
a panda as Juliet,

07:13.400 --> 07:16.937
chased by Romeo's family
of bamboo farmers.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.940
I have to tell my new
friend about that one.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.510
So you're okay
with this?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.344
A big play needs
a big dog!

07:24.377 --> 07:26.379
I'd also like to talk
to a pyrotechnician

07:26.413 --> 07:28.248
to discuss
special effects.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.116
Can you believe it?

07:29.149 --> 07:34.121
My new friend actually
saw R&J Bamboo!

07:34.154 --> 07:36.389
So you were the one!?

07:36.423 --> 07:39.026
Of course it will
cost a little extra but

07:39.059 --> 07:41.929
I think it would be well
worth it, don't you?

07:41.962 --> 07:42.429
Yes, Jared.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.832
Yes.

07:46.266 --> 07:50.504
And a semi-colon bracket
to you too my new friend.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.540
Hey that's a winky face!

07:52.573 --> 07:54.975
How have I never
seen you before?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.444
Caleb: Wow!

07:57.477 --> 07:58.445
You like it?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.981
I was worried I wouldn't
remember all of my ideas

08:01.014 --> 08:03.050
after I lost my first
set of sketches.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.217
Like it?

08:04.251 --> 08:05.085
I love it.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.887
My dad says everybody
is an artist,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.622
but sometimes life
makes you forget.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.258
My dad always told me
to take out the trash.

08:12.025 --> 08:16.496
Hey I was wondering if I
could ask you something?

08:16.530 --> 08:17.497
You just did.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.999
What?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.133
No, no, um.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.569
Can I ask you
something else

08:21.602 --> 08:24.237
other than asking you if
I could ask you...

08:24.271 --> 08:26.139
I'm confused.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.340
I'm just kidding.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.577
Ask me anything.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.579
Our kiss.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.480
I was just wondering
if maybe I,

08:33.513 --> 08:36.316
I squished your face, or had
bad breath, or drooled...

08:36.349 --> 08:40.420
What I'm trying to
say is, was it okay?

08:40.453 --> 08:42.189
Our kiss was...

08:45.092 --> 08:54.568
*

08:54.602 --> 08:59.539
* They say you'll
know when it's true *

08:59.573 --> 09:04.912
* But what I'm feeling,
it's just all so brand new *

09:04.945 --> 09:10.050
* They say you'll
know when it's right *

09:10.083 --> 09:13.687
* But I've never been here
before, I've never tried *

09:13.721 --> 09:16.523
* I wanna know,
wanna know *

09:16.556 --> 09:18.926
* What this love
is about *

09:18.959 --> 09:24.097
* I don't know what I'm
feeling gotta figure it out *

09:24.131 --> 09:32.005
* I wanna know, gotta know, what
all of this could lead to *

09:32.039 --> 09:36.176
* Am I really
falling for you *

09:36.209 --> 09:41.048
* Ohh, oh, ohh
...Falling for you *

09:41.081 --> 09:45.686
* Ooh, oh, ohh ...

09:45.719 --> 09:50.691
* You say you wanna
be friends.

09:50.724 --> 09:56.029
* We play it cool but
it's so hard to pretend *

09:56.063 --> 10:00.400
* Deep down I think
we both know *

10:00.433 --> 10:03.203
* You and I and what we
have could somehow *

10:03.236 --> 10:06.139
* Continue to grow

10:06.173 --> 10:11.211
* Not a day goes by

10:11.244 --> 10:16.283
* Without me thinking about
you and your sweet smile *

10:16.316 --> 10:27.060
* Could we one day
be, together *

10:27.094 --> 10:30.764
* Ohhh

10:30.798 --> 10:33.600
* I wanna know, wanna
know knoooo-ohoh *

10:33.633 --> 10:35.435
* What this love
is about *

10:35.468 --> 10:37.204
* I don't know
wha-a-at *

10:37.237 --> 10:40.640
* I don't know what I'm
feeling gotta figure it out *

10:40.674 --> 10:42.075
* Figure it out...

10:42.109 --> 10:43.443
* Figure it ooooooout

10:43.476 --> 10:45.245
* I wanna know, gotta know

10:45.278 --> 10:47.447
* What all of this
could lead to... *

10:47.480 --> 10:48.548
* Whoa

10:48.581 --> 10:52.452
* Am I really
falling for you *

10:52.485 --> 10:55.355
* For yeaaahhhahaaaa

10:55.388 --> 11:00.627
* Falling for youuuuuuuuuuu
Ooh oh, ohh... *

11:00.660 --> 11:05.432
* Falling for you
Ohh, oh, ohh ... *

11:05.465 --> 11:09.102
* Gotta know,
Gotta know *

11:09.136 --> 11:13.707
* Am I really falling for you

11:18.078 --> 11:20.413
Our kiss was... great.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.815
Really?

11:21.849 --> 11:24.217
That's better than okay!

11:24.251 --> 11:26.419
I'm so gonna write
this in in my journal.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.289
Did I say journal, I
don't have a journal?

11:29.322 --> 11:32.492
Oh, whow, wait

11:32.525 --> 11:33.460
It's okay.

11:34.728 --> 11:38.766
Thank you all for joining me on
this journey of self-discovery.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.101
Um, who's
playing Dorothy?

11:41.134 --> 11:42.569
She has no lines.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.138
Dorothy will be played
as a shadow puppet.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.239
Let her say nothing.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.409
It'll speak volumes.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.212
The Cowardly Lion
has all the lines?

11:52.245 --> 11:55.282
I'm changing the rest
of the cast to a chorus.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.384
You provide the
soundscape.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.119
Here's a soundscape
for you Jared,

11:59.152 --> 12:02.722
The sound of two
feet walking.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.525
I'm outta here.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.560
Whatever.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.263
Um...

12:10.297 --> 12:12.565
Jared?

12:12.599 --> 12:14.768
That's the whole cast.

12:14.802 --> 12:18.138
And now we finally have the
show we're looking for:

12:18.171 --> 12:22.575
Just Corki, the star,
center stage.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.549
*

12:36.356 --> 12:39.860
Jared dropped the entire
cast except Corki!

12:39.893 --> 12:41.128
He has to go.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.729
I know.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.496
Wait.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.166
You agree with me?

12:46.199 --> 12:46.967
Don't move.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.369
This may be a sign
of the apocalypse.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.138
How did this happen?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.272
Not sure.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.674
We're never going to agree
on anything again, are we?

12:54.707 --> 12:55.542
Not a chance.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.378
Got it.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.779
Good talk.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.283
Okay, let's
rehearse pages

13:03.316 --> 13:06.686
twelve through
one-hundred-and-nine.

13:06.719 --> 13:07.120
Jared.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.421
I'm exhausted.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.923
I can't do it.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.224
Of course you can.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.493
You're talented
and strong.

13:13.526 --> 13:17.164
And I would never ask you
to do anything unreasonable.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.832
Now, let's try it again,

13:18.866 --> 13:20.100
this time dancing
through every scene,

13:20.133 --> 13:24.471
punctuating the dramatic moments
with pirouettes and somersaults.

13:24.504 --> 13:28.208
What does that have to do
with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.577
I'm making a
masterpiece here.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.544
A story about Oz,

13:31.578 --> 13:35.415
that has absolutely
nothing to do with Oz.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.717
Sometimes my thoughts
are so powerful,

13:37.750 --> 13:42.455
they give me
headaches.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.658
I'm done.

13:45.692 --> 13:49.396
I'm sorry, for a second there I
thought you said, "I'm done".

13:49.429 --> 13:50.630
I did.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.833
This play is making everything
else in my life fall behind.

13:53.867 --> 13:58.605
I can't support this at the cost
of my grades, friends, and band.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.441
I'm sorry, Jared...

14:05.312 --> 14:06.846
I knew it.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.481
You're a great actress.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.751
For a second there I actually
thought you were quitting.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.853
Corki?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.889
Corki?

14:15.923 --> 14:18.758
Nope, she's really leaving.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.367
Interesting.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.003
Sun Hi: You cannot
let this happen.

14:30.037 --> 14:30.670
Ms. Song.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.404
Hello.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.839
Jared's taken
over the play.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.741
It has only one actor.

14:34.774 --> 14:35.442
CORKI!!!

14:35.475 --> 14:36.509
Not me.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.445
Jodi and Caleb are trying
to pitch him their ideas

14:38.478 --> 14:39.646
and not one
includes me.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.983
There is a lot going on around
here that is not about me,

14:43.016 --> 14:44.985
Mr. Stark, and you
have to fix that.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.753
Thank you.

14:46.786 --> 14:47.955
That's weird.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.958
You usually don't thank me
after one of my classic rants.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.625
I'm web-famous now.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.295
Which is better than regular
famous because it sounds cooler.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.296
But I need more.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.897
I got a monkey on my back.

14:57.931 --> 15:01.301
A newborn chimp at the zoo, and
he's getting more hits than me!

15:01.334 --> 15:01.935
More?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.170
It's not enough.

15:03.203 --> 15:08.341
I need more friends... more
hits... more impersonal love!

15:08.375 --> 15:11.011
Mr. Stark, the web
doesn't usually love.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.513
It's a fluid
relationship at best.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.582
Maybe if I use my
catchphrase some more?

15:15.615 --> 15:16.816
"Leave me alone!"

15:16.849 --> 15:18.518
Record me saying that!

15:18.551 --> 15:20.720
At least take a
selfie with me.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.592
Do duckface.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.827
People still do duckface right?

15:27.860 --> 15:30.530
(camera click)

15:31.698 --> 15:32.599
It's great.

15:32.632 --> 15:36.536
Beyond.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.005
He has to love it, right?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.772
Well, it's Jared.

15:39.806 --> 15:40.573
True.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.576
What he mostly
loves is himself.

15:43.610 --> 15:48.315
So, why did you
ask me to the dance?

15:48.348 --> 15:49.182
What do you mean?

15:49.216 --> 15:51.384
Anyone would be
lucky to go with you.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.386
Why me?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.988
Because I felt
like you got me.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.090
I do, I totally get you.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.191
We're so compatible.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.627
I feel like we could finish
each other's sentences.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.629
Yeah, I think we make
a pretty good--

16:02.662 --> 16:04.531
Chocolate cake.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.833
I was going to say team.

16:06.866 --> 16:09.302
But you were thinking
chocolate cake.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.006
Ms. Diona: The entrance
will be here.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.907
The "Ms. Diona
Aquatic Center."

16:14.941 --> 16:17.644
Has a nice ring to
it, don't you think?

16:17.677 --> 16:20.447
Next year this auditorium
will be transformed into a

16:20.480 --> 16:22.082
state-of-the-art
swimming center.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.951
No more need for
the performing arts.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.519
No performing arts?

16:26.553 --> 16:29.122
After the play tanks, the
school board will see that

16:29.156 --> 16:31.691
the arts are a
waste of time.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.761
And the pool plans will
move along swimmingly.

16:34.794 --> 16:35.862
Haha.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.865
Swimmingly.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.034
Who says principals
don't have fun.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.670
Sun Hi: Mr. Stark....

16:43.703 --> 16:44.737
Mr. Stark...

16:44.771 --> 16:45.972
Not now, Sun Hi.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.741
A lottery official with very bad
spelling is about to wire me

16:48.775 --> 16:49.842
a hundred thousand dollars.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.745
All I have to do is send him
my credit card numb--

16:52.779 --> 16:53.280
Stop!!!!

16:53.313 --> 16:53.813
What have you done?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.482
You're a web zombie.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.084
You've got to
snap out of it.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.086
We need to get
you on your feet.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.887
But I was about
to become rich.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.690
Not to mention how upset my
followers are going to be

17:03.723 --> 17:05.692
when I don't give my
tri hourly report

17:05.725 --> 17:07.494
on the current state
of my indigestion.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.895
What did you
tell your mother

17:08.928 --> 17:10.897
you wanted to be when
you were younger?

17:10.930 --> 17:13.500
A giant of the theater
or a desperate web celeb?

17:13.533 --> 17:14.901
I think I said
geothermal engineer...

17:14.934 --> 17:16.103
No you didn't!

17:16.136 --> 17:18.105
The play's a disaster and
everything you gave your life

17:18.138 --> 17:19.506
to create will
be destroyed

17:19.539 --> 17:23.143
and turned into a
glorified wading pool.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.477
You're right.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.912
My veins are
filled with blood.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.914
Not pixels
and dot coms.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.383
A pox on you,
Internet!

17:33.120 --> 17:35.855
We have to save
the arts program!

17:35.888 --> 17:40.460
Plus the play, your
job, and my hair.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.496
What's does your hair
have to do with it?

17:43.530 --> 17:47.066
Do you have any idea what
chlorine does to my color?

17:48.801 --> 17:49.502
*

17:49.536 --> 17:51.904
At least I still
have you, Hans.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.576
So I heard you broke Oz?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.178
Genius is rarely
understood in its time.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.180
If we don't put on
a great show,

18:00.213 --> 18:02.182
Ms. Diona will close down
the theater department.

18:02.215 --> 18:06.553
And super-talented, on-their-
way-to- fame, cool kids like me,

18:06.586 --> 18:09.189
who aren't cast in the
play yet but totally should be,

18:09.222 --> 18:11.458
won't have a stage
to shine on.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.126
This can't happen!

18:13.160 --> 18:15.195
But we are here
to save the day.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.529
Check out Jodi's designs!

18:16.563 --> 18:17.630
You're gonna love them.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.831
And the music Caleb did!

18:18.865 --> 18:24.003
All hits, all day, all Oz.

18:24.036 --> 18:27.540
Oh sure, now
you show up.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.908
And watch...

18:28.941 --> 18:35.682

That's fantastic!

20:27.894 --> 20:29.996
We can do this.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.264
Yes!

20:31.298 --> 20:32.832
Change it up!

20:32.865 --> 20:35.001
Now it's time
to cast me--

20:35.034 --> 20:36.603
but it won't be easy.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.805
Like living with your
mother for thirty years...

20:38.838 --> 20:39.606
Huh?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.239
What?

20:40.273 --> 20:41.073
Nothing...

20:41.107 --> 20:43.843
I'm not to sure
about all of this--

20:43.876 --> 20:46.245
Let it go Jared.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.384
I'm taking back the play.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.253
I'm sensing a
dramatic shift.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.322
This is so exciting.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.956
It's just like Macbeth!

20:56.989 --> 20:58.358
Wait! Don't say that.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.191
Say what? Macbeth?

20:59.225 --> 21:00.793
No!

21:00.827 --> 21:02.662
Sun Hi, this is nothing
like Macbeth.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.363
Stop!

21:03.396 --> 21:03.930
You're right.

21:03.963 --> 21:04.797
I never read Macbeth.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.899
I was definitely
gonna fail that quiz.

21:06.933 --> 21:07.967
Arghhh!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.001
What's wrong?

21:09.035 --> 21:10.970
The Shakespearean
curse.

21:11.003 --> 21:14.006
If you mention that
play in a theater,

21:14.040 --> 21:16.776
your show is
doomed to failure.

21:16.809 --> 21:17.877
Oops.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.178
Fools.

21:19.211 --> 21:22.014
There's no such
thing as curses.

21:28.321 --> 21:31.858
On the other hand, I'll
take all the help I can get.

21:34.694 --> 21:44.704

21:44.737 --> 21:54.747

21:54.781 --> 22:03.656
