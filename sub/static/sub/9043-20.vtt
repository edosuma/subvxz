00:03.133 --> 00:04.600
YOU'RE WELCOME IN MY HOME,

00:04.600 --> 00:07.367
UNLESS YOU SIT IN MY CHAIR
TOUCH MY REMOTE,

00:07.367 --> 00:11.767
OR ARE MARRIED TO ME.

00:11.767 --> 00:14.733
- FRANK, THAT'S HOW YOU TALK
AFTER CHURCH?

00:14.733 --> 00:17.767
- YEAH, MY PRAYERS
WEREN'T ANSWERED.

00:17.767 --> 00:21.467
[door closes]
- NEXT TIME PRAY FOR HAIR.

00:21.467 --> 00:23.733
- WELL, I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO BOTH OF YOU,

00:23.733 --> 00:27.133
BUT GOD STOPPED LISTENING
TO YOU GUYS A LONG TIME AGO.

00:27.133 --> 00:29.733
- WHAT'S FOR BRUNCH, MARIE?
- HAM.

00:29.733 --> 00:33.267
- EXCELLENT, I SHALL PUT ON
MY HAM PANTS.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.400
- WE'RE GOING OUTSIDE.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.600
- OKAY, BUT STAY OUT OF THE MUD!

00:37.600 --> 00:39.800
I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING
YOUR NICE CLOTHES ALL--

00:42.567 --> 00:44.133
- YOU WANT SOME HELP
IN THE KITCHEN, MARIE?

00:44.767 --> 00:46.300
- OH, THANK YOU, AMY.

00:46.300 --> 00:51.800
- YEAH, I'LL HELP TOO.
- OH...OKAY.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.533
- DON'T LEAN TOO FAR
INTO THE OVEN, LADY.

00:56.267 --> 01:00.100
- SO FATHER HUBLEY HAD
A WONDERFUL SERMON TODAY,

01:00.100 --> 01:01.233
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:01.233 --> 01:03.200
- YEAH, YEAH.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.767
THE OLD GUY CAN STILL BRING
THE HEAT.

01:05.767 --> 01:08.567
- LIAR, I SAW YOU SLEEPING
THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.

01:08.567 --> 01:11.567
- NO, NO, NO.
I HEARD IT.

01:11.567 --> 01:13.467
- YEAH? OKAY,
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?

01:13.467 --> 01:16.133
- IT WAS ABOUT THE SINS OF...

01:16.133 --> 01:17.500
STICKING YOUR BIG UGLY FACE

01:17.500 --> 01:19.867
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.700
[doorbell rings]

01:21.700 --> 01:25.667
- HAVE FUN IN HELL, RAYMOND.
- YEAH.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.233
YOU'LL BE BARTENDING THERE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

01:27.233 --> 01:28.633
- I'LL BE BARTENDING
UPSTAIRS.

01:28.633 --> 01:32.067
DAMN IT!

01:35.100 --> 01:39.033
- GOOD MORNING.
DOES FRANK BARONE LIVE HERE?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.600
- WHAT DID HE DO?

01:41.600 --> 01:45.100
- NOTHING, NOTHING.
I'M JUST AN OLD FRIEND.

01:45.100 --> 01:47.000
- FRIEND?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.233
- ARE--ARE YOU HIS FAMILY?

01:49.233 --> 01:51.533
- WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

01:51.533 --> 01:53.867
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH,
HE'S OUR FATHER.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.500
I'M RAY.
THIS IS ROBERT.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.400
- WELL, MY NAME'S SAM GILULA.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.567
I HAVEN'T SEEN MR. BARONE
IN ABOUT 25 YEARS.

02:00.567 --> 02:04.000
HE'S A GREAT MAN,
YOUR FATHER.

02:07.033 --> 02:11.067
- DID YOU SAY
FRANK BARONE?

02:11.067 --> 02:14.600
- YEAH, WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,
I USED TO WORK AFTER SCHOOL

02:14.600 --> 02:16.400
AT THE SAME COMPANY
AS YOUR FATHER.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.033
HE WAS A REAL MENTOR TO ME.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.167
- MENTOR?

02:24.167 --> 02:29.733
- YOU SURE
YOU DON'T MEAN "TOR-MENTOR"?

02:32.333 --> 02:35.400
- DAMN IT, MARIE.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.200
THE ELASTIC IS COMPLETELY SHOT
ON THESE PANTS.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.467
- MR. BARONE?
- WHO ARE YOU?

02:40.467 --> 02:42.133
[door shuts]
- SAM GILULA!

02:42.133 --> 02:45.933
"SAMMY BOY"
FROM PELK ACCOUNTING?

02:45.933 --> 02:49.200
- OH, MY GOD!
SAMMY.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.000
AREN'T YOU A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES?

03:07.267 --> 03:08.733
- IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, MR. BARONE.

03:09.567 --> 03:11.800
- HOW ABOUT
THIS KID, HUH?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.833
"MR. BARONE" HE CALLS ME.

03:13.833 --> 03:17.467
YOU TWO NEVER
CALLED ME THAT.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.500
SO, SAMMY BOY,
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

03:21.500 --> 03:24.467
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M FINALLY
GOING INTO BUSINESS FOR MYSELF,

03:24.467 --> 03:26.600
OPENING UP MY OWN
OFFICE SUPPLY STORE

03:26.600 --> 03:28.000
RIGHT HERE IN LYNBROOK.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.333
MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN
THE SIGNS.

03:29.333 --> 03:34.733
"THE OFFICE SUPPLY BIN--
BIN THERE, BOUGHT THAT."

03:34.733 --> 03:36.367
- YEAH.

03:36.367 --> 03:39.633
YEAH, I-I KNOW THAT SIGN.

03:39.633 --> 03:41.200
IT'S RIGHT NEXT
TO THE BILLBOARD

03:41.200 --> 03:43.867
WITH THE BIKINI LADY
RIDING THE BEEPER.

03:43.867 --> 03:45.367
- YEAH.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.567
SO ANYWAY, SINCE I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

03:47.567 --> 03:49.300
I JUST WANTED
TO COME BY

03:49.300 --> 03:52.100
AND THANK YOU FOR BEING
SUCH AN INSPIRATION TO ME

03:52.100 --> 03:53.733
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.400
I OWE A LOT TO YOU.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.867
- UH, DON'T MENTION IT, KID.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.233
YOU LIKE HAM?

04:01.233 --> 04:03.667
COME ON,
STRAP ON A FEED BAG.

04:03.667 --> 04:07.200
- THANKS, BUT NO,
I GOT TO GET BACK TO THE STORE.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.300
WE OPEN IN A WEEK,
AND I GOT A TON TO DO.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.900
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD MEAN
A LOT TO ME

04:10.900 --> 04:13.633
IF YOU'D COME BY
AND SEE THE PLACE SOMETIME.

04:13.633 --> 04:16.533
- WELL, YEAH.
WELL, HOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

04:16.533 --> 04:17.767
- REALLY?

04:17.767 --> 04:19.600
- DAD, WE'RE JUST ABOUT
TO SIT DOWN TO EAT.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.667
- HEY, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOU
AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY.

04:21.667 --> 04:25.000
- YEAH, YEAH.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.367
I'LL GO PUT ON
A NICER SHIRT.

04:30.933 --> 04:33.133
- I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT IT MUST'VE BEEN LIKE

04:33.133 --> 04:37.767
GROWING UP
WITH A DAD LIKE HIM.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.167
- YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS,
OR SHOULD I?

04:46.567 --> 04:51.067
- IT WAS A MAGICAL
CARPET RIDE.

04:51.067 --> 04:53.367
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

04:53.367 --> 04:54.700
THE WHOLE TIME I KNEW HIM,

04:54.700 --> 04:59.267
HE ONLY EVER MENTIONED
HAVING TWO GIRLS.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.133
- WELL, I MEAN, THAT SAM
SEEMED NICE ENOUGH.

05:09.133 --> 05:10.333
- YEAH.
- YEAH, I GUESS.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.633
BUT WHAT I DON'T GET IS,

05:11.633 --> 05:13.133
HOW COME WE NEVER
HEARD ABOUT HIM BEFORE?

05:13.133 --> 05:15.867
DAD NEVER MENTIONED SAM
TO YOU, MA?

05:15.867 --> 05:17.767
- NOT A WORD.
- [gasps]

05:17.767 --> 05:19.233
WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT

05:19.233 --> 05:23.467
THAT SAM IS FRANK'S
ILLEGITIMATE SON?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.533
- HEY, YEAH!

05:31.533 --> 05:33.700
MAYBE FRANK'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS
WITH A SECRET LIFE.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.600
YOU KNOW, LIKE MAYBE HE'S GOT
ANOTHER FAMILY IN FLORIDA.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.200
- THAT WOULD BE
THE ONLY FAMILY IN FLORIDA

05:47.200 --> 05:51.800
TRYING TO ESCAPE TO CUBA.

05:51.800 --> 05:55.200
- THAT'S GOOD.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.633
I GOTTA SAY, DAD REALLY SEEMED
TO LIKE THAT GUY.

05:59.633 --> 06:05.067
- NO, NO, YOUR FATHER
DOESN'T LIKE PEOPLE.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.667
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.900
LOOK WHAT I GOT
AT THE SUPPLY BIN.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.233
- HEY.

06:10.233 --> 06:11.333
- HERE YOU GO, KIDS.
HAVE FUN WITH THESE.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.633
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

06:12.633 --> 06:14.267
- HEY, YOU SHOULD SEE
SAM'S PLACE.

06:14.267 --> 06:16.033
YOU KNOW HOW MANY
DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENVELOPES

06:16.033 --> 06:17.533
HE'S GOT THERE?

06:17.533 --> 06:18.967
- 85.

06:18.967 --> 06:22.467
- 32.
DON'T BE A WISEASS.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.367
- THESE ARE JAZZY.

06:29.367 --> 06:30.533
- WELL, I'D BETTER GET BACK.

06:30.533 --> 06:31.933
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU ALL.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.133
- OKAY, BYE.
- BYE-BYE.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.533
- OH, AND THANKS AGAIN,
MR. BARONE.

06:35.533 --> 06:38.767
IT WAS REALLY GREAT TO BE ABLE
TO TALK WITH YOU AGAIN.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.900
- OKAY, SAMMY, I'LL BE
BY THE STORE REAL SOON.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.367
- ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
BYE, NOW.

06:52.367 --> 06:55.700
- OKAY.
[door shuts]

06:55.700 --> 06:58.933
- MARIE, HAM.

06:58.933 --> 07:02.433
- ON THE TABLE, CONGEALING.

07:04.167 --> 07:07.267
- YOU KNOW, FRANK,
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

07:07.267 --> 07:10.967
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU DO
TO INSPIRE THIS FELLOW?

07:10.967 --> 07:12.367
- I DON'T KNOW.

07:12.367 --> 07:16.167
I GUESS I JUST HAVE THAT EFFECT
ON PEOPLE.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.833
- I THINK SAM'S BEEN
SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME

07:22.833 --> 07:25.767
SNIFFING THE MAGIC MARKERS.

07:25.767 --> 07:28.133
- HEY, KNOCK IT OFF.
HE'S A REAL GOOD GUY.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.300
- I'D LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING.

07:30.300 --> 07:33.633
WHO IS HE, FRANK?

07:33.633 --> 07:36.000
WHO IS HE?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.733
- I TOLD YOU, HE'S A KID WHO
USED TO HANG AROUND THE OFFICE.

07:38.733 --> 07:41.033
- WELL, HOW COME YOU NEVER
TOLD ME ABOUT HIM?

07:41.033 --> 07:42.167
- I DON'T KNOW.

07:42.167 --> 07:45.633
- JUST TELL ME,
IS HE YOUR SON?

07:48.533 --> 07:49.833
- WHAT?

07:49.833 --> 07:51.400
- OH, MARIE!

07:51.400 --> 07:53.267
WE WERE JUST JOKING
ABOUT THAT.

07:53.267 --> 07:54.867
- WHO WAS IT, FRANK?

07:54.867 --> 07:56.233
HARRIET LICHTMANN?

07:56.233 --> 07:59.033
- OH, COME ON!

07:59.033 --> 08:01.167
- IS THIS BOY
REALLY SAMMY LICHTMANN,

08:01.167 --> 08:03.200
YOUR LOVE CHILD?

08:03.200 --> 08:04.333
- LOVE CHILD?

08:04.333 --> 08:05.833
YOU'RE NUTS, LADY!

08:05.833 --> 08:07.200
- OH, YEAH?

08:07.200 --> 08:11.933
YOU THINK
I DON'T SEE HE'S BALD?

08:11.933 --> 08:14.133
YOU MISSED BRUNCH TODAY.

08:14.133 --> 08:16.333
YOU MISSED A HAM, FRANK.

08:16.333 --> 08:18.200
AND IN 47 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

08:18.200 --> 08:20.533
YOU HAVE NEVER
TURNED YOUR BACK ON PORK.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.700
- ALL RIGHT.

08:21.700 --> 08:22.933
CALM DOWN, MARIE.

08:22.933 --> 08:26.533
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

08:26.533 --> 08:28.167
- NOTHING, DAD,
IT'S JUST FUNNY

08:28.167 --> 08:30.500
THAT--THAT YOU HAD
SUCH AN EFFECT ON THIS GUY.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.333
I MEAN, HE'S EVEN SAYING
THAT YOU WERE HIS MENTOR.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.900
- SO?
- "SO". OKAY, HERE WE GO.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.600
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
I CAN BE VERY INSPIRING.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.167
- OKAY, OKAY.
- OH, NOW HE'S INSPIRING, OKAY.

08:42.167 --> 08:43.833
- HEY, HEY,
STOP LAUGHING, YOU MORONS.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.233
- ALL RIGHT,
SORRY, DAD.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.467
NO, YOU'RE GREAT.
YOU'RE GREAT.

08:46.467 --> 08:47.667
YOU SHOULD TOUR
THE COUNTRY

08:47.667 --> 08:50.100
SPREADING
THE FRANK BARONE GOSPEL.

08:50.100 --> 08:55.733
"CLOSE YOUR MIND
AND OPEN YOUR PANTS!"

08:55.733 --> 08:59.767
- "HYGIENE
AND OTHER WASTES OF TIME."

08:59.767 --> 09:03.167
- "FIND YOURSELF.
JUST FOLLOW THE SMELL."

09:06.067 --> 09:07.400
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:07.400 --> 09:09.067
WE COULD MAKE SOME MONEY
IF HE GOES ON TOUR.

09:09.067 --> 09:10.800
CHARGE $10 TO GET IN.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.233
- $20 TO GET OUT.

09:12.233 --> 09:15.200
- AH!
GOOD.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.100
- OKAY, FELLAHS,
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.

09:17.100 --> 09:21.500
IT IS SUNDAY.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.067
- NO, NO, NO,
IT'S FINE.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.533
YOU TWO ARE A REAL
PAIR OF JOKERS.

09:24.533 --> 09:26.467
I'M GLAD I CAME HOME
FOR THIS.

09:26.467 --> 09:30.267
MARIE, I'M GONNA
HAVE BRUNCH AT THE LODGE!

09:37.433 --> 09:39.367
- YOU KNOW,
WHY DID I WORRY?

09:39.367 --> 09:43.167
WHO ELSE
WOULD SLEEP WITH HIM?

09:52.333 --> 09:56.000
- SO HOW ARE YOU?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.200
- FINE.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.233
- YEAH? YOU SURE?

10:00.233 --> 10:04.833
- WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING
TO KICK THINGS OFF HERE?

10:04.833 --> 10:06.133
- NO.

10:06.133 --> 10:09.067
NO, I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.400
- OH, I'M KIND OF READING.

10:15.967 --> 10:19.067
- I JUST THOUGHT YOU AND ROBERT
SEEMED A LITTLE UPSET TODAY.

10:19.067 --> 10:21.433
- WELL, NO,
WE WEREN'T UPSET.

10:21.433 --> 10:25.667
- NO? ABOUT YOUR DAD BEING
SO FRIENDLY WITH THAT SAMMY GUY?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.600
- WHAT HAVE WE GOT
TO BE UPSET ABOUT?

10:27.600 --> 10:28.700
IT WAS FUNNY.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.100
"CLOSE YOUR MIND.
OPEN YOUR PANTS."

10:31.100 --> 10:32.467
[chuckles]

10:32.467 --> 10:34.133
I JUST--
I MADE THAT ONE UP.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.233
"WE'LL CHARGE 'EM 20"--
THAT ONE WE'VE DONE BEFORE.

10:36.233 --> 10:38.233
WE'VE DONE THAT ONE.

10:38.233 --> 10:41.633
- OH, AND THIS WHOLE THING
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

10:41.633 --> 10:45.767
- NO, LOOK,
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, OKAY?

10:45.767 --> 10:47.633
I-I KNOW YOU LIKE
TO THINK

10:47.633 --> 10:50.133
THAT I'M A LOT MORE
COMPLICATED THAN I SEEM,

10:50.133 --> 10:51.933
BUT PLEASE, TRUST ME,

10:51.933 --> 10:55.767
NOTHING MUCH
GOING ON UP THERE, OKAY?

10:55.767 --> 10:59.633
REALLY.
SEE? LOOK, LISTEN.

10:59.633 --> 11:01.467
THERE'S VERY LITTLE
IN THERE.

11:01.467 --> 11:03.033
IT'S JUST A COUPLE
OF GOLF BALLS

11:03.033 --> 11:04.733
KNOCKING UP
INTO A PAIR OF BREASTS.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.200
THAT'S IT.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.667
SO YOU KNOW,

11:08.667 --> 11:10.967
COULD YOU GO ANALYZE
SOMEBODY ELSE, DR. QUACK?

11:10.967 --> 11:12.800
'CAUSE I'M FINE.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.433
- OKAY. I'M SORRY.

11:20.467 --> 11:23.933
- BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS THAT CRAP
ABOUT MENTORING?

11:23.933 --> 11:28.500
I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW
HE MENTORED ME AND ROBERT?

11:28.500 --> 11:32.167
HE'D SAY, "QUIT BEING A BABY,
AND SUCK IT UP!"

11:32.167 --> 11:36.533
THAT'S RIGHT.
"SUCK IT UP, NANCY!"

11:36.533 --> 11:39.500
THOSE WERE HIS GREAT WORDS
OF SUPPORT, SECOND ONLY

11:39.500 --> 11:43.133
TO "GET OFF YOUR PITY POT
AND ACT LIKE A MAN!"

11:43.133 --> 11:45.033
HEARD THAT
WHEN I WAS FOUR,

11:45.033 --> 11:49.200
THE FIRST TIME
I FELL OFF MY BIKE.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.333
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE--

11:51.333 --> 11:53.333
- AND THEN HE GOES
AND HE HUGS THIS GUY.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.800
WHAT IS HE DOING
HUGGING THIS GUY?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.000
YOU KNOW
WHEN HE HUGGED ME?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.300
THE CLOSEST HE EVER CAME

11:58.300 --> 11:59.733
WAS WHEN HE WRAPPED
HIS ARMS AROUND ME

11:59.733 --> 12:02.900
TO DRAG ME AWAY
FROM A CAKE HE WANTED.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.133
YOU KNOW?

12:05.133 --> 12:09.267
AND IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.

12:09.267 --> 12:10.733
- YOU KNOW, RAY, I--

12:10.733 --> 12:14.533
- HE'S HUGGING THIS GUY!
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

12:17.200 --> 12:21.967
- RAY?
- WHAT?

12:21.967 --> 12:25.233
- YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX?
- NO!

12:28.333 --> 12:31.733
YES!

12:35.267 --> 12:41.200
SO, MOM, DID DAD AND/OR THE HAM
EVER COME BACK?

12:41.200 --> 12:45.467
- ONE CAME BACK
INSIDE THE OTHER.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.733
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO MAKE ME LUNCH, MARIE.

12:52.733 --> 12:55.200
I'M TAKING SAM TO THE LODGE
TO MEET THE BOYS.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.867
- FRANK, WAIT.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:57.867 --> 12:59.400
- AMY AND I THINK THAT

12:59.400 --> 13:01.533
YOU AND RAY AND ROBERT
NEED TO TALK.

13:01.533 --> 13:02.967
- HEY, WHOA, WHOA.
NO, WE DON'T.

13:02.967 --> 13:04.833
- WE NEVER SAID THAT.

13:04.833 --> 13:06.300
- YES, YOU DO.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.367
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THIS WHOLE SAM SITUATION.

13:08.367 --> 13:11.500
- YOU WANT TO CLEAR THE AIR
AND GET OUT YOUR FEELINGS.

13:11.500 --> 13:16.133
DEBRA AND I DISCUSSED IT
AT THE MALL.

13:16.133 --> 13:20.533
- I HATE THAT DAMN MALL.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.700
- RAY, WHY DON'T YOU START

13:23.700 --> 13:26.367
BY TELLING YOUR FATHER
SOME OF THE THINGS

13:26.367 --> 13:28.800
YOU WERE TELLING ME
LAST NIGHT?

13:28.800 --> 13:31.233
- YOU TOO, ROBERT.
- I DON'T NEED TO.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.933
- YES, YOU DO.
- NO, I DON'T.

13:32.933 --> 13:36.633
- THEN WHY'D YOU PUNCH A HOLE
IN THE HEADBOARD LAST NIGHT?

13:39.400 --> 13:42.733
- I THOUGHT I HEARD
A MOUSE BACK THERE.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.333
- IT'S A GOOD IDEA, ROBERT.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.833
TELL YOUR FATHER
HOW HE FAILED YOU.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.933
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
I'LL BE AT THE LODGE.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.833
- NO, WAIT, FRANK.

13:56.833 --> 13:59.500
WHAT'S TROUBLING YOUR SONS

13:59.500 --> 14:01.633
IS THAT IT SEEMS YOU'RE ABLE
TO ACHIEVE

14:01.633 --> 14:04.133
A LEVEL OF INTIMACY
WITH A STRANGER

14:04.133 --> 14:06.433
THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY--

14:06.433 --> 14:09.700
- NO!
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.867
- DON'T SAY THAT.
NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT.

14:12.867 --> 14:14.233
- THEN YOU SAY IT!

14:14.233 --> 14:19.967
- COME ON, TELL HIM, RAYMOND.
TELL HIM.

14:19.967 --> 14:23.367
- OKAY, IT'S JUST...

14:23.367 --> 14:27.267
WE COULDN'T HELP
NOTICING THAT--THAT...

14:27.267 --> 14:28.867
YOU REALLY LIKE
THIS SAM GUY,

14:28.867 --> 14:31.433
AND YOU--YOU WERE AN INSPIRATION
TO HIM AND EVERYTHING,

14:31.433 --> 14:34.600
AND WE...

14:34.600 --> 14:37.767
KIND OF GOT JACK.

14:37.767 --> 14:43.067
- SQUAT, JACK SQUAT.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.500
- JACK SQUAT?
GIVE ME A BREAK.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.367
- SEE, FRANK, MAYBE
THIS IS THE ATTITUDE--

14:47.367 --> 14:48.833
- STOP!

14:48.833 --> 14:52.367
THIS IS THE ATTITUDE!

14:52.367 --> 14:54.533
- THE SAME
JACK SQUAT ATTITUDE

14:54.533 --> 14:58.300
THAT PROVES THE THESIS
OF OUR DISCONTENT.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.167
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

15:07.167 --> 15:09.067
BUT IT SOUNDS
LIKE FRUITY WHINING TO ME.

15:09.067 --> 15:11.700
- WELL, WE'RE NOT WHINING.
WE'RE PISSED OFF.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.133
- YEAH, HE'S PISSED OFF!

15:25.500 --> 15:27.067
- YOU NEVER GAVE US
THE TIME OF DAY,

15:27.067 --> 15:28.400
SO HOW DO YOU THINK
IT MAKES US FEEL,

15:28.400 --> 15:29.933
WE FIND OUT
THERE'S A KID OUT THERE

15:29.933 --> 15:32.033
THAT YOU WERE
ACTUALLY NICE TO?

15:32.033 --> 15:33.400
- MAYBE HE WAS
ACTUALLY NICE TO ME!

15:33.400 --> 15:34.967
DID YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

15:34.967 --> 15:36.900
- WHAT?
- HE WAS NICE TO ME!

15:36.900 --> 15:38.200
HE RESPECTED ME!

15:38.200 --> 15:40.200
YOU GUYS NEVER DID!

15:40.200 --> 15:41.867
- HOW COULD WE RESPECT YOU?

15:41.867 --> 15:44.267
HOW COULD WE RESPECT A GUY
WHO LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS,

15:44.267 --> 15:45.700
"STOP BRUSHING
YOUR TEETH SO LOUD.

15:45.700 --> 15:50.967
I'M TRYING
TO WATCH 'GUNSMOKE'"?

15:50.967 --> 15:54.100
- YOU DID
BRUSH LOUDLY, ROBERT.

16:01.267 --> 16:04.967
- ARE YOU HELPING ME, MA?

16:04.967 --> 16:06.300
- I WAS A GREAT FATHER.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.700
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.300
YOU GAVE US GREAT INSPIRATION,
GREAT ADVICE.

16:09.300 --> 16:11.067
"QUIT CRYING!
YOU GOT PLENTY OF BLOOD!"

16:11.067 --> 16:12.467
- "DON'T SCREW UP.

16:12.467 --> 16:15.533
YOU'RE BIG,
EVERYONE WILL NOTICE MORE!"

16:15.533 --> 16:17.767
- YOU DONE?
GOOD-BYE!

16:17.767 --> 16:21.967
- WAIT!

16:21.967 --> 16:23.167
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS WAY!

16:23.167 --> 16:24.867
- OUT OF MY WAY, SISTER.

16:24.867 --> 16:26.200
- I MAY BE NEW HERE,

16:26.200 --> 16:27.533
BUT I KNOW THIS FAMILY
WELL ENOUGH

16:27.533 --> 16:29.500
TO KNOW THAT YOU BOYS
LOVE EACH OTHER,

16:29.500 --> 16:31.867
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NEED.

16:31.867 --> 16:35.733
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HE'LL EAT YOU.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.700
- I THINK YOU BOYS
NEED TO HUG.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.867
- WHAT!
- AAH!

16:44.867 --> 16:48.333
- I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE!

16:50.300 --> 16:52.633
- YOU HUGGED SAM LICHTMANN.

16:52.633 --> 16:55.100
YOU CAN HUG YOUR SONS.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.567
- I HADN'T SEEN HIM
FOR 30 YEARS.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.667
IF YOU PEOPLE GO AWAY
FOR 30 YEARS,

16:59.667 --> 17:03.267
I'LL HUG YOU TOO.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.500
- I DON'T WANT TO BE HUGGED.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.567
- ALL RIGHT, I THINK
MARIE AND AMY ARE RIGHT.

17:11.567 --> 17:14.067
A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS
IN THIS FAMILY WOULDN'T EXIST

17:14.067 --> 17:15.867
IF THERE WAS
A LITTLE MORE HUGGING

17:15.867 --> 17:17.367
AND A LITTLE LESS YELLING,

17:17.367 --> 17:20.600
SO, FRANK, HUG YOUR SONS!

17:20.600 --> 17:22.700
- GET OVER THERE.
- COME ON. HERE.

17:22.700 --> 17:26.533
- GET OFF OF ME!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:37.567 --> 17:40.933
- I'M UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THIS!

17:40.933 --> 17:42.533
- TRUST ME,
YOU NEED THIS.

17:42.533 --> 17:45.900
OPEN YOURSELF UP
TO GENUINE AFFECTION.

17:45.900 --> 17:49.233
- YOUR WIFE IS SO QUEER.

17:54.767 --> 17:58.133
- I KNOW.

17:58.133 --> 18:00.200
- OKAY, COME ON, LET'S GO.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.233
PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER.
COME ON.

18:02.233 --> 18:03.533
- I'M LATE FOR LUNCH.

18:03.533 --> 18:06.367
THE LODGE WILL KNOW
I'M MISSING.

18:06.367 --> 18:07.933
- YOU'D BETTER HOPE
THAT YOUR LODGE IS OPEN

18:07.933 --> 18:10.267
FOR THREE MEALS A DAY
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

18:10.267 --> 18:11.967
IF YOU DON'T HUG
THESE BOYS,

18:11.967 --> 18:16.200
MY KITCHEN IS CLOSED.

18:27.033 --> 18:31.067
- THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

18:31.067 --> 18:35.233
- MARIE,
I WANT STEAK TONIGHT.

18:35.233 --> 18:36.433
- ALL RIGHT, COULD WE STOP?

18:36.433 --> 18:37.733
THE SMELLS
FROM MY CHILDHOOD

18:37.733 --> 18:41.733
ARE STARTING TO COME BACK.

18:41.733 --> 18:45.333
- DID WE HAVE A MONKEY?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.033
- HI.

18:53.033 --> 18:55.600
[overlapping greetings]

18:55.600 --> 18:58.667
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT
WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING,

18:58.667 --> 19:01.833
UH, BUT YOUR GRANDSON
TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.500
- HEY,
THANKS, GEOFFREY.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.867
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET GOING
TO THE LODGE.

19:05.867 --> 19:07.167
- ACTUALLY, I CAN'T GO.

19:07.167 --> 19:08.633
THERE'S TROUBLE
DOWN AT THE STORE.

19:08.633 --> 19:09.900
- WHAT GIVES?

19:09.900 --> 19:11.300
- THE BUILDING INSPECTOR

19:11.300 --> 19:13.900
SLAPPED ME
WITH 18 CODE VIOLATIONS.

19:13.900 --> 19:16.100
IT'S REALLY BAD.

19:16.100 --> 19:19.533
- OH, THAT'S A PITY.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.133
- IT'S A COMPLETE DISASTER.

19:21.133 --> 19:23.000
I GOT TO TEAR UP
THE CONCRETE FLOOR,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.167
REDO THE ELECTRICAL.

19:24.167 --> 19:26.233
MY INVESTORS
ARE GONNA KILL ME.

19:26.233 --> 19:30.400
I JUST FEEL LIKE
SHUTTING THE WHOLE THING DOWN.

19:34.567 --> 19:38.000
- HEY, MAN,
THAT REALLY IS TOO BAD.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.133
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:40.133 --> 19:44.167
- AW, BOO-HOO, WOE IS ME.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.667
- OH, FRANK!

19:45.667 --> 19:47.033
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

19:47.033 --> 19:48.600
I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO GET OFF YOUR PITY POT

19:48.600 --> 19:49.900
AND ACT LIKE A MAN.

19:49.900 --> 19:54.000
I MEAN IT.
GIVE ME A BREAK, NANCY.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.200
- THAT ISN'T
VERY NICE, FRANK!

19:56.200 --> 19:57.633
- WHAT DID I ALWAYS
TELL YOU?

19:57.633 --> 19:59.500
- QUIT CRYING AND SUCK IT UP.
- WHAT?

19:59.500 --> 20:01.267
- QUIT CRYING AND SUCK IT UP!
- THAT'S RIGHT.

20:01.267 --> 20:05.667
QUIT CRYING AND SUCK IT UP,
YOU WHINY BABY.

20:05.667 --> 20:09.800
- DAD, DAD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.167
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. BARONE.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.833
- OH-HO, WHOA, WHOA!
- EXCUSE ME?

20:14.833 --> 20:17.900
- I'M BEING A WIMP.
I CAN HANDLE THIS!

20:17.900 --> 20:20.933
- OKAY, THEN QUIT BLUBBERING.
YOU'RE MAKING ME SICK.

20:20.933 --> 20:25.400
YEAH! YOU SEE, THIS IS
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS MAN.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.700
MY OWN FATHER
CANDY-COATED EVERYTHING.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.700
"OH, YOU'RE GREAT.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.133
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
I LOVE YOU."

20:33.133 --> 20:36.133
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

20:36.133 --> 20:40.267
THANK YOU, MR. BARONE.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.033
- I'M HUNGRY.

20:55.033 --> 20:58.567
YOU TWO MOOKS WANT TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT AT THE LODGE?

20:58.567 --> 21:00.367
- YEAH. WHY NOT?

21:00.367 --> 21:02.233
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO THE LODGE.

21:02.233 --> 21:04.967
I MEAN, I HAVE A LOT OF FOOD
HERE I CAN MAKE.

21:04.967 --> 21:09.467
- [laughs]

21:09.467 --> 21:12.667
OH, THAT'S FUNNY, DEBRA.

21:12.667 --> 21:16.000
COME ON, I'VE GOT SOME NICE,
BIG STEAKS ACROSS THE STREET.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.200
- OH!

21:17.200 --> 21:21.100
- STEAK IT IS.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.400
- DID THAT HURT
YOUR FEELINGS A LITTLE?

21:28.400 --> 21:30.500
WELL, STOP YOUR CRYING

21:30.500 --> 21:35.133
AND GET OFF
YOUR PITY POT, NANCY!

21:39.100 --> 21:42.733
- YOU REALLY ARE QUEER.
