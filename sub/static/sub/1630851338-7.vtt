00:02.069 --> 00:07.005
♪ ♪

00:51.385 --> 00:52.484
Hart:
One would expect that the body

00:52.553 --> 00:55.087
Would have been thrown
by the oncoming train.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.521
Indeed.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.357
Instead of being
hit and thrown,

00:58.359 --> 01:00.092
She appears to
have been run over

01:00.094 --> 01:01.960
While laying
on the tracks.

01:01.996 --> 01:04.363
Suicide, perhaps?

01:04.365 --> 01:06.298
One possibility.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.301
Doesn't appear to carry
any identification.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.371
We should get her body off
the tracks before the 7:15.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.107
Gentlemen?

01:20.614 --> 01:23.781
Seems your suicide might
not be a suicide after all.

01:23.818 --> 01:24.983
What are we looking at?

01:24.985 --> 01:28.386
Limestone, typical of
macadam paving material.

01:28.522 --> 01:31.990
I saw no macadam
at the railroad tracks.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.925
Someone must have
moved her body.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.194
It was likely
she was already dead

01:35.329 --> 01:37.129
When the train cut
her in half.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.997
Excellent work, mrs. Hart.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.833
We eagerly await
your postmortem results.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.471
Mrs. Hart, where do
you buy your hats?

01:46.507 --> 01:47.439
Hart:
Hats?

01:47.508 --> 01:49.007
Well, according to my wife,

01:49.076 --> 01:51.476
"violet hart wears
the most exquisite hats."

01:51.479 --> 01:53.711
Oh! Well, tell your
wife I'm very flattered.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.414
I get them made at miss
driscoll's millinery on queen.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.949
Ah! Thank you.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.985
Margaret's been
in the doldrums recently.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.686
I think a jaunty
new titfor might

02:01.755 --> 02:03.288
Put the spring
back in her step.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.756
Titfor?

02:04.892 --> 02:06.625
Tit for tat! Hat.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.527
Good day, mrs. Hart.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.229
Oh!

02:13.367 --> 02:14.633
What is it
you're looking for?

02:14.635 --> 02:15.901
A map.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.502
Well, you've got
plenty of them there.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.370
I'm looking for
a specific map.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.572
Here it is.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.843
Brackenreid:
The planning map of toronto.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.845
It indicates which
paving material is used

02:26.914 --> 02:28.647
On each
of the city's streets.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.848
Macadam is green.

02:30.885 --> 02:35.086
The deceased's body was
found on the tracks... Here.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.121
Brackenreid: And the nearest
stretch of macadam?

02:37.158 --> 02:38.456
Murdoch:
Here.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.057
Her name was
jennifer drask.

03:12.059 --> 03:15.160
We were in the process
of notifying the authorities

03:15.295 --> 03:17.262
Of her disappearance.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.299
A sad end
to a wretched life.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.834
What was her crime?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.270
Extortion. Larceny.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.507
Miss drask had a knack for
relieving people of their money.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.110
And her record
as an inmate?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.712
Exemplary.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.782
As you know, we seek to
rehabilitate, not punish.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.851
Miss drask was intent
on bettering herself.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.520
That's why her escape
comes as such a surprise.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.123
I don't think
it was an escape.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.325
I believe miss drask
was murdered

03:47.394 --> 03:49.193
And her body was moved
to the tracks.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.797
Murdered? Dear lord.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.933
I'll need to familiarize
myself with the facility.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.835
Head matron klotz
will show you around.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.577
The pantry,
where we store and prepare food.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.015
The laundry, where we
teach how to wash clothes.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.950
The mercer philosophy

04:12.987 --> 04:15.554
Is redemption through
domestic service.

04:15.689 --> 04:20.558
Do any of your wards reject
this brand of redemption?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.828
Yes. But not jennifer.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.897
She was obedient and docile,
a favourite among the matrons.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.833
And what of the inmates?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.268
They were cruel to her.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.536
Just last week she was
viciously assaulted.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.674
Miss klotz?
Who is this man?

04:35.809 --> 04:38.510
Detective william murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.711
And you are?

04:39.747 --> 04:41.646
Doctor almira cotton.
Head physician.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.315
I'm investigating
the death of--

04:43.317 --> 04:47.519
Poor jennifer. I heard.
It's terribly sad.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.454
She was one of
your patients?

04:49.523 --> 04:51.590
These women
are all my patients.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.591
This isn't work for me,
detective.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.994
It's a... Calling.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.762
One to which
I must now return.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.164
Dr. Cotton?

05:00.200 --> 05:04.001
I'll need to see the clinical
file on the deceased.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.071
Nurse adelina,
pull the file.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.405
Yes, dr. Cotton.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.875
You'll receive the file
on your way out, goodbye.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.878
The sewing room.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.685
Are all of the windows here
at the reformatory barred?

05:20.688 --> 05:22.154
Yes.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.421
Right, then.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.823
I'll need to
see the roof.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.759
The roof? Inmates don't
have access to the roof.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.146
Miss klotz.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.451
Who smokes
these cigarettes?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.888
All the inmates
smoke those.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.426
Attention everyone!

06:34.495 --> 06:37.229
I'm detective william murdoch
of the toronto constabulary.

06:37.364 --> 06:40.364
I'm investigating the murder
of one of your fellow inmates,

06:40.401 --> 06:42.967
A miss jennifer drask.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.705
We got no snitches here,
detective.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.440
Least not now
that jennifer's gone.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.507
Klotz:
Miss dowson!

06:50.911 --> 06:52.110
I beg your pardon?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.445
Beg all you want.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.846
I got nothing more
to say to you,

06:54.981 --> 06:56.514
Nor do the others.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.856
Have you made
an arrest in the case?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.725
Unfortunately,
not yet.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.005
Hm.
It's a match.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.875
It would seem miss drask
did indeed fall from the roof.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.377
Fall?

07:25.512 --> 07:27.679
Likely not
of her own volition.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.917
Hart:
What's this?

07:38.192 --> 07:39.757
May I use a scalpel?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.506
An engagement ring.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.715
And it's engraved
with the letters "e. E."

08:07.988 --> 08:09.820
"e. E."

08:11.592 --> 08:14.993
We do have an edna emerson
in our care.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.761
What led to
her conviction?

08:18.732 --> 08:20.264
Her father brought her
before the judge

08:20.300 --> 08:22.200
Because she was
pregnant and unmarried.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.936
She was sent here for
being incorrigible, and...

08:24.972 --> 08:26.671
Oh, dear.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.607
Her stillborn child

08:28.742 --> 08:30.808
Was delivered here
in the reformatory.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.076
Oh.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.779
Um, I'd like to speak with
this miss emerson, please.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.884
It has your
initials on it.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.687
I'm not the only e.E.
In the world.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.357
Anyways, we're not allowed
to have jewelry in here.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.291
This ring isn't mine.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.893
You're quite sure?

08:48.896 --> 08:51.362
I would certainly know
if I had been engaged,

08:51.398 --> 08:52.763
Wouldn't I?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.307
I came as soon
as I heard.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.774
What's this about?

09:03.810 --> 09:05.443
This is about you,
my darling.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.778
I bought you a gift.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.513
Why?

09:08.648 --> 09:10.247
Because I love you.

09:10.284 --> 09:11.315
Go on.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.056
Oh!

09:18.125 --> 09:20.859
You bought me another hat.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.193
I did.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.662
But not that hat.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.397
You bought me a hat,
but not this hat?

09:26.466 --> 09:27.499
Exactly.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.600
But if you take
that hat...

09:29.636 --> 09:30.868
To this shop,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.872
Then you can exchange it
for any other hat you like.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.673
I arranged it myself.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.141
Really?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.010
I've also arranged
dinner reservations

09:39.145 --> 09:40.946
At that fancy french
place that you like.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.246
Hm.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.349
So, go and pick
yourself something nice

09:44.484 --> 09:46.618
And we'll show it off
all over town.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.388
Thank you, thomas.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.426
I've yet to set foot
in the plaza theatre.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.895
It's supposedly
quite the marvel,

09:57.030 --> 09:58.964
Seats 900 spectators.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.632
900, eh?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.233
Current show
sounds promising,

10:02.269 --> 10:05.036
Quebec's queen of vaudeville,
eva tanguay.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.307
Jack?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.010
Ah, could we turn down
this way instead?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.511
I spotted clara's
cousin over there.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.046
I'd like to avoid her.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.852
Also on the bill
is long tack sam,

10:20.921 --> 10:24.122
A magician whose performance
is said to enchant.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.925
I could use a bit of
enchantment, couldn't you?

10:27.927 --> 10:31.062
I just can't stop wondering
how many of those 900 people

10:31.098 --> 10:33.798
Would tell clara that
they've seen us together.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.835
I owe it to her
not to incite gossip.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.738
Plus, she finds
vaudeville crude.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.773
Well, let's
not invite her.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.882
Be kind, lewellyn.

10:50.951 --> 10:54.486
My marriage helps shield
you and I from scrutiny.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.190
It's a flimsy shield if I can
never been seen with you, jack.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.495
Brackenreid:
Ah! Watts! Perfect timing.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.996
Uh, this is...

11:06.033 --> 11:07.699
What's your
name again, sir?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.567
Milo strange.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.102
Detective llewellyn watts.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.703
Charmed.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.906
Uh, what is
this regarding?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.641
Walt whitman
has been abducted.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.844
Uh... Walt whitman is dead.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.880
Don't say that.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.648
Walt whitman.
The poet?

11:23.783 --> 11:25.717
Walt whitman the peacock.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.919
Someone has
absconded with him.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.987
-I'll leave you to it, then.
-But--

11:30.057 --> 11:31.322
It's a bit
of a head scratcher,

11:31.391 --> 11:32.657
But I'm sure you'll
crack it, watts.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.930
-You're smirking.
-I assure you I--

11:38.932 --> 11:41.599
It's fine.
I understand.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.868
Mockery's a defense
deployed when a person

11:43.870 --> 11:46.670
Is confronted
by nonconformity.

11:46.707 --> 11:50.141
I'm sure you're familiar
with the experience.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.143
Nice jacket.

11:52.278 --> 11:55.079
-Hm? Oh.
-Will you help me?

12:03.457 --> 12:04.822
Thank you for
breakfast, julia.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.224
What a surprise.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.825
It's nice to
have the time.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.428
The perks of
being unemployed.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.430
Murdoch:
Indeed.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.832
Well, one thing is certain:

12:13.967 --> 12:18.035
The inmates at that reformatory
will not speak with me.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.439
I've heard the reformatory's
a dreadful institution.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.510
The mercer claims
to provide the inmates

12:25.579 --> 12:26.844
With the skills required

12:26.913 --> 12:29.313
To integrate into
the general populace.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.716
Yes, but most of those
women have been imprisoned

12:31.851 --> 12:34.385
For such atrocities
as disobeying their parents.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.454
And fornication.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.390
Or socializing
with other races!

12:39.392 --> 12:41.993
All things that men
can do with impunity.

12:42.062 --> 12:45.530
I'm not surprised they won't
confide in a man with a badge.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.767
Any idea how I could go about
getting them to trust me?

12:48.902 --> 12:51.936
I suppose you could
plant an investigator

12:51.938 --> 12:55.006
Amongst the prisoners,
someone that the women

12:55.008 --> 12:57.008
Would trust
and confide in.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.810
Intriguing proposal.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.012
I wonder who I could
get to do that?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.619
Maggie muldoon,
you have been sentenced

13:08.688 --> 13:10.755
To the andrew mercer reformatory

13:10.890 --> 13:13.224
For an indeterminate period.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.231
Welcome, dr. Ogden.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.099
So, what am I being
convicted of?

13:22.135 --> 13:25.236
Or, rather,
what am I in for?

13:25.272 --> 13:27.205
It seems you
are a pickpocket.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.574
Oh! Marvelous.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.256
-Hello.
-No talking amongst inmates.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.291
This is not a social club.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.813
Stop it.

14:08.815 --> 14:11.382
No talking in the halls,
miss muldoon.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.620
Now look what
you made me do!

14:15.689 --> 14:17.321
Silence!

14:17.357 --> 14:19.757
What is going on here?

14:19.892 --> 14:22.559
New girl has no respect,
slopping her filth all over.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.162
You pushed me!

14:24.297 --> 14:27.131
You must like it in the hole,
queenie dowson.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.567
I lie there dreaming
of you, helga.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.038
Guard, take miss dowson
to the basement!

14:34.173 --> 14:36.173
Don't trust this one, girls!
She's hiding something!

14:36.209 --> 14:37.975
She really did push me.

14:38.011 --> 14:41.111
No one likes a snitch, muldoon.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.580
Go fetch a mop.

14:43.617 --> 14:44.848
Move!

14:52.759 --> 14:54.091
[julia winces]

14:58.197 --> 14:59.898
This is how you sew
the hem correctly.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.532
See the stitches?

15:01.534 --> 15:04.535
Evenly spaced
and in a straight line.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.737
-Fine work, edna.
-Thank you, miss klotz.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.678
And this is how
you sew the hem incorrectly.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.280
See the blood?
The mess...

15:16.349 --> 15:17.948
I don't even know
what to call this.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.883
If blasphemy
was a textile.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.519
I'm so sorry, miss klotz.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.988
I wish I had
edna's talent.

15:24.057 --> 15:27.458
Perhaps she could show me
what I'm doing wrong.

15:27.494 --> 15:31.095
Bleed on the cloth again
and you'll be scrubbing floors.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.698
Edna, show her
how to sew the hem.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.068
Thank you.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.306
So, how how do you?

15:42.309 --> 15:45.376
Oh. Oh.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.444
You make it
look so easy.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.380
Thank you.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.116
I'm maggie.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.053
Queenie's gonna kill you
when she gets out of the hole.

16:03.930 --> 16:07.297
This is where I saw him last,
scratching under the lilac.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.337
Why walt whitman?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.338
We share the same
vocation.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.008
As well as the same...

16:17.077 --> 16:18.576
Inclinations.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.744
You're a poet?

16:20.780 --> 16:24.415
And I too "celebrate
myself and sing myself."

16:24.551 --> 16:28.019
"and what I assume
you shall assume."

16:28.154 --> 16:30.755
"for every atom
belonging to me..."

16:30.824 --> 16:33.290
"as good belongs to you."

16:34.995 --> 16:36.494
Whitman was a bit of
a peacock himself,

16:36.496 --> 16:37.595
Don't you agree?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.164
Schlage:
Strange! Where are you?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.366
Who is that?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.502
A brute whose soul contains
not one iota of peacock.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.103
My neighbour,
burl schlage.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.640
I heard you've been
making accusations.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.241
Where is he, burl?

16:51.277 --> 16:55.046
I didn't take your dang bird,
you niminy-piminy fop.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.914
It had to be you.
You hate walt whitman.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.315
You've made that clear.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.051
Is that true?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.786
Sure, I hate him.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.921
Drives me mad with
his infernal squawking.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.591
You see? What kind
of monster hates birdsong?

17:06.726 --> 17:07.858
Hm.

17:07.927 --> 17:10.127
Who's your little
friend, strange?

17:10.129 --> 17:12.663
Oh.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.800
Ah, thing is, detective,
it ain't birdsong.

17:15.802 --> 17:19.236
It's more like,
"squaw, squaw, squaw."

17:19.238 --> 17:21.272
Excuse me. This is
a criminal investigation.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.674
You'd do well
to take it seriously.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.010
What makes you think
someone would take it?

17:26.145 --> 17:28.479
Well,
any birdbrain can see...

17:28.515 --> 17:31.348
This latch don't hold.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.888
I'm making no headway
with edna emerson.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.890
Or the other inmates,
for that matter.

17:38.892 --> 17:42.893
You need to make them
believe you are one of them.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.162
I agree. But how?

17:46.632 --> 17:47.831
Punch someone?

17:47.867 --> 17:49.366
William.

17:49.368 --> 17:51.969
I would prefer
a less violent approach.

17:54.240 --> 17:58.109
What if maggie muldoon
were to bring in contraband?

18:02.582 --> 18:05.316
Edna. Want a burner?

18:13.125 --> 18:14.592
Klotz:
Put the fabric down, muldoon.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.393
I'm taking you off
sewing duty. Come.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.270
Try not to burn yourself.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.154
Oh, don't get tangled up
with that one, muldoon.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.490
Queenie dowson here spends
most of her days in the hole.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.626
Shivering in the dark
like the vermin she is.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.095
Not a word!

18:51.230 --> 18:53.831
Or I'll send you
right back down there.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.700
It's no wonder your family
had you locked up.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.170
You are wretched
and shameless.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.005
Unworthy, unloved
and undeserving of anything--

19:06.045 --> 19:07.444
You!

19:07.480 --> 19:09.914
Ogden: Sorry. I think
it slipped out of my hand.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.154
[groans]

19:18.358 --> 19:21.291
Next time,
you get ten of those.

19:23.529 --> 19:24.494
Back to work!

19:34.874 --> 19:37.408
Winifred? Has anyone
seen winifred sanders?

19:37.477 --> 19:39.443
-Hold.
-There you are.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.179
Winnie, dr. Cotton
will see you now.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.815
I don't wish to go,
nurse adelina. Please.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.583
You can discuss it
with the doctor.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.052
Winifred: You know
she'll turn a deaf ear.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.620
What's this about?

19:49.755 --> 19:50.921
I don't want to
see the doctor.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.623
Not this again. Guard!

19:52.659 --> 19:54.425
Take her to surgery.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.161
Where are they
taking her?

19:57.230 --> 19:58.895
She's getting snipped.

19:58.932 --> 19:59.897
Snipped?

19:59.966 --> 20:02.699
Yeah. It's the doc's specialty.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.036
She says it stops
incorrigibles from breeding.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.971
That's barbaric.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.109
The girl who died,
did she get snipped?

20:12.145 --> 20:13.377
Jennifer?

20:13.512 --> 20:16.913
Yeah, but she didn't
seem to mind.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.051
Edna, how did
jennifer get your ring?

20:22.355 --> 20:24.822
Who told you?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.423
You know how
people gossip.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.158
Mm-hm.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.860
Jennifer was my friend.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.729
And when I ended
things with leon,

20:31.731 --> 20:33.197
I gave the ring to her.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.865
Too many memories.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.800
I'm sorry.

20:36.802 --> 20:38.335
Leon's an indian.

20:38.371 --> 20:41.071
Being with him is what got me
sent here in the first place,

20:41.107 --> 20:43.340
Mixing races and all.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.276
I had to end it.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.212
Move!

20:48.214 --> 20:49.446
Psst. New girl.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.621
Ah, mrs. Hart, thank you
for the recommendation.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.057
So, how's
the postmortem going?

21:00.192 --> 21:01.425
It's been challenging.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.693
The trauma to her body

21:02.695 --> 21:04.362
Complicates
the process tremendously.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.697
Understood.
What have you found so far?

21:06.832 --> 21:08.765
She was a robust
woman of 32.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.434
The injuries from
the train occurred

21:10.569 --> 21:12.236
After miss drask
had already died.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.138
She was killed
by the fall.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.940
As we expected.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.442
She also has a relatively
new surgical scar.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.444
Her file from
the mercer mentions

21:20.480 --> 21:23.447
She had a tubal ligation
while at the reformatory.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.782
Anything else?

21:24.851 --> 21:25.983
Yes.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.585
There was an injection
administered here

21:27.587 --> 21:28.919
Shortly before her death.

21:29.054 --> 21:32.389
The toxicology analysis shows
she was heavily sedated.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.559
So, she was drugged before
she fell off the roof.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.730
Come look.

21:46.438 --> 21:47.471
Nice view, huh?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.941
And the fresh
air is just...

21:51.077 --> 21:52.609
How'd you get
the door open?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.812
One of the girls
stole a key from a guard.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.480
We pass it around.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.950
Up here, you can
almost pretend you're free.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.088
Is this where
that girl fell?

22:04.157 --> 22:07.257
Jennifer?
Yeah, probably.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.560
I say good riddance.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.628
She was a snitch
and a teacher's pet.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.264
Everyone hated her.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.699
Edna said
they were friends.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.102
Some friend.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.904
Should have heard
jennifer taunting edna

22:20.039 --> 22:21.772
About the baby
she lost.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.775
Edna was crying
and jennifer wouldn't stop.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.778
So, I socked her
in the teeth.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.913
When was that?

22:29.982 --> 22:31.615
Day before she died.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.251
I was locked up in the hole
when jennifer went off the roof.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.788
I asked edna about it.

22:37.824 --> 22:41.458
She said jennifer
got what she had coming.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.938
You will stand in the corridor
and maintain silence

22:53.940 --> 22:56.140
While we perform
inspections.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.209
Exit your cells.
Quickly now!

23:32.979 --> 23:35.779
So, the toxicology report
found sedatives?

23:35.815 --> 23:38.849
And yet none were recorded
in miss drask's medical file.

23:38.851 --> 23:42.186
Well, apparently, the other
inmates despised her.

23:42.321 --> 23:45.322
Perhaps one of them
obtained the drugs?

23:45.358 --> 23:47.525
I could try to search
the doctor's office.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.327
Also,
I found a love letter

23:50.329 --> 23:53.531
From edna's ex-fiancé,
leon redbird.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.266
She told me they'd broken up,
but the letter says otherwise.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.337
If miss emerson pushed
miss drask off the roof,

24:00.473 --> 24:02.139
Then I suppose mr. Redbird

24:02.274 --> 24:04.275
Could have moved
her body to the tracks.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.688
Leon redbird?

24:18.690 --> 24:21.425
-Yes?
-May I have a word?

24:23.930 --> 24:26.096
Detective william murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

24:26.098 --> 24:29.199
I understand you know
miss edna emerson?

24:29.268 --> 24:31.134
What happened?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.502
Is she okay?

24:32.538 --> 24:34.371
Oh! Miss emerson is fine.

24:34.407 --> 24:37.107
I'm actually investigating
the death of another inmate,

24:37.109 --> 24:39.376
A miss jennifer drask?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.180
Read the name
in the papers.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.849
No, never met her.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.750
It's a sad story.

24:50.223 --> 24:51.489
Mr. Redbird?

24:51.624 --> 24:54.191
Ah, no,

24:54.193 --> 24:56.226
I'm worried about edna
in that awful place.

24:56.262 --> 24:59.663
Ah, yes.
My sympathies.

24:59.665 --> 25:03.300
However, I must ask,
where were you two nights ago?

25:03.302 --> 25:05.402
Two nights ago.

25:05.471 --> 25:08.739
I pulled an overnight unloading
a truckload of cabbages.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.809
Can anyone confirm this?

25:11.811 --> 25:15.212
Uh, the driver.
He'll vouch for me.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.418
-May I?
-You may.

25:21.454 --> 25:23.254
Thank you.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.759
[baby cries]

25:29.895 --> 25:32.563
A missing bird
is not police business.

25:32.565 --> 25:33.564
But--

25:33.699 --> 25:35.432
The law can't help you,
mr. Strange.

25:35.468 --> 25:36.901
But certainly someone
would have noticed

25:37.036 --> 25:39.469
A peacock wandering
the streets of toronto.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.572
I am positive
he's been stolen.

25:41.641 --> 25:44.174
Who on god's green earth
would want to steal a peacock?

25:44.243 --> 25:47.044
The bloody bird
likely just flew away.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.846
And landed on
your wife's head?

25:52.585 --> 25:54.585
You don't like it?

25:56.022 --> 25:57.721
It's exquisite.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.191
I was on the brink
of concluding my report

26:01.327 --> 26:03.127
And I found something
quite unusual.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.260
What is it?

26:04.297 --> 26:07.130
Though miss drask
had a sterilization scar,

26:07.166 --> 26:09.600
She had not, in fact,
been sterilized.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.402
A surgical scar
but no surgery?

26:12.471 --> 26:13.537
Are you quite sure?

26:13.672 --> 26:14.672
Yes.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.940
Her reproductive organs
are completely intact.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.009
Then why the scar?

26:19.045 --> 26:20.945
That's your domain.

26:25.484 --> 26:27.217
Put your back into it,
muldoon.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.301
Edna emerson!

26:44.436 --> 26:46.437
I am thoroughly
disappointed in you.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.806
No! No, please!
Please don't put me in the hole!

26:48.808 --> 26:50.507
Please don't
put me in the hole!

26:50.509 --> 26:51.842
You keep scrubbing
'til we come back.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.360
Cotton:
How did you get in here?

27:12.465 --> 27:14.431
Explain yourself.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.166
I think I'm coming
down with the flu.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.668
I...

27:17.670 --> 27:19.470
I came to look for you,
but the door was open.

27:19.605 --> 27:23.006
Lies. You're trying
to steal from me!

27:23.009 --> 27:24.474
No.

27:24.543 --> 27:27.211
But I am curious
why you're hiding

27:27.213 --> 27:29.112
All this money
in your office.

27:30.549 --> 27:32.349
That is none
of your concern.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.753
I'll not be questioned
by an incorrigible.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.488
You have no idea who I am.

27:38.624 --> 27:41.291
Your impertinence
is unacceptable.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.227
Nurse,
sedate this patient.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.328
You will not!

27:45.398 --> 27:47.564
Matron klotz,
restrain her.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.601
Don't touch me.

27:50.736 --> 27:53.103
You're nothing but
an insolent wastrel.

27:53.238 --> 27:54.404
I'm a surgeon.

27:54.407 --> 27:55.973
And a better one
than you, I'd wager.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.307
Surgeon?

27:57.443 --> 28:00.310
This one can't hem a tablecloth
let alone sew up a wound.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.245
She is clearly delusional.

28:02.247 --> 28:04.114
Step one:
Gather your materials.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.182
I prefer holbein
superfine needles,

28:06.218 --> 28:07.918
Threaded with cat gut.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.787
The same kind you use,
dr. Cotton.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.521
Quiet, adelina.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.623
Ogden: Step two:
Sterilize your materials.

28:13.659 --> 28:14.992
I hear you're a huge

28:15.127 --> 28:16.860
Sterilization
enthusiast, doctor.

28:16.995 --> 28:20.330
Miss muldoon,
you are being disruptive.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.933
My name is dr. Julia ogden,
and you're damn right I am.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.835
Cotton: Nurse adelina,
give her the injection!

28:26.138 --> 28:28.471
Don't! Call the warden!
He'll tell you.

28:28.473 --> 28:29.739
Give her the shot.

28:29.741 --> 28:30.874
No!

28:30.943 --> 28:32.209
I'm sorry.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.296
Let me out of here!

28:53.332 --> 28:55.064
Let me out!

28:57.536 --> 28:59.369
Just send the bill
to my parents.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.070
Of course, miss bowden.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.377
Is this your handiwork?

29:07.446 --> 29:09.078
Oh. It certainly is.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.414
A beauty, isn't she?

29:10.549 --> 29:12.282
I call her
"the penelope".

29:12.351 --> 29:14.651
You should call her
"the walt whitman."

29:14.786 --> 29:15.953
Come again?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.354
[distant squawks]

29:17.489 --> 29:18.822
He knows his name!

29:21.994 --> 29:24.260
How did you
procure this peacock?

29:24.296 --> 29:26.062
I bought it off
a street urchin.

29:26.064 --> 29:28.732
He claimed he had
caught it in the wild.

29:28.867 --> 29:33.069
Are you suggesting that
peacocks are native to ontario?

29:33.071 --> 29:35.606
I'm suggesting
I bought it fair and square.

29:35.741 --> 29:38.141
Oh, come now.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.076
It's even wearing
the silver ankle band

29:40.112 --> 29:42.412
Upon which mr. Strange
inscribed its name.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.081
I don't care if he dressed
it in a ball gown

29:44.216 --> 29:45.482
And called it aunt sally.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.017
It's mine now!

29:47.019 --> 29:48.518
I paid three
dollars for it.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.354
Regardless of how it came
into your possession,

29:50.489 --> 29:53.290
This peacock clearly
belongs to mr. Strange.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.825
It's all right, detective.

29:54.827 --> 29:57.026
I believe
this nice woman's story.

29:57.062 --> 30:01.365
And vengeance is not an
instinct I incline to indulge.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.035
Tell you what: Make me
one of your gorgeous hats,

30:05.104 --> 30:06.837
Using whitman's feathers.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.972
Name your price.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.441
Add on the amount you paid
the child. I'll buy it.

30:11.510 --> 30:15.612
But whatever you do,
I'm taking my peacock home.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.851
I'm so sorry.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.921
I don't agree with
throwing women in the hole.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.256
There are a lot of things
about this place

30:26.292 --> 30:27.724
I don't agree with.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.861
Is it true? You're a doctor?

30:30.863 --> 30:32.028
Yes.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.331
I'm secretly investigating
the reformatory.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.533
Really?

30:36.602 --> 30:38.936
It's about time someone
exposed the conditions here.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.138
Thank you for doing this.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.739
Well, yes.

30:42.875 --> 30:47.077
I think I've gathered enough
evidence to finish my report.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.679
Do you think you could
get me out of here?

30:53.018 --> 30:53.983
Follow me.

30:58.123 --> 31:00.123
You don't have an appointment
with the warden.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.759
The warden has accepted
unscheduled visits in the past.

31:02.761 --> 31:04.761
It should be no different
on this occasion.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.763
Well, then it's a shame
the warden isn't here.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.165
On this occasion.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.632
Where might the warden be?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.968
Attending a family
function in kingston.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.371
I am here on official
police business.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.039
I need to question
one of your inmates,

31:16.174 --> 31:17.741
A maggie muldoon.

31:17.743 --> 31:21.044
That one. Always trouble.
You cannot see her.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.113
She is undergoing
corrective therapy.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.647
I beg your pardon?

31:24.783 --> 31:26.183
She's being disciplined.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.619
-Sir!
-I warned you.

31:30.823 --> 31:31.821
Julia!

31:34.226 --> 31:35.459
Julia!

31:38.196 --> 31:39.329
Julia!

31:39.398 --> 31:41.231
William!
Thank you, adelina.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.668
Oh, thank god.
Are you all right?

31:44.737 --> 31:46.269
I'm fine, william,
but I do believe

31:46.272 --> 31:48.005
I'm ready to be sprung
from this place.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.406
What have you found out?

31:49.475 --> 31:51.474
Edna emerson could not
have drugged jennifer.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.677
The supplies are
too well secured.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.211
Well, then who?

31:55.213 --> 31:57.747
Dr. Cotton is acting
very suspiciously.

31:57.816 --> 32:00.617
She has a stack of money
hidden in her office,

32:00.619 --> 32:03.086
Which she most adamantly
does not wish to discuss

32:03.088 --> 32:05.422
And when I confronted
her on it, she...

32:05.424 --> 32:08.625
She drugged me
and put me in...

32:08.760 --> 32:09.692
The hole.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.963
I am appalled that
you're taking the word

32:13.098 --> 32:14.898
Of this reprobate over--

32:14.900 --> 32:16.233
It's in the drawer.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.635
This reprobate is working
with the toronto constabulary.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.908
That money has nothing
to do with your investigation.

32:27.079 --> 32:30.379
Did jennifer drask bribe you
to stop the operation?

32:30.381 --> 32:31.815
What?

32:31.884 --> 32:33.617
Jennifer drask's
file indicates

32:33.619 --> 32:35.652
You performed
a sterilization procedure.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.188
Yet, in our postmortem,
we found no evidence

32:38.190 --> 32:40.023
Of such a surgery.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.858
Did she threaten
to expose you?

32:41.860 --> 32:43.694
Is that why
you killed her?

32:43.829 --> 32:45.728
That's nonsense!

32:45.730 --> 32:47.731
You gave jennifer drask
a fake scar

32:47.733 --> 32:49.766
In order to hide
your corruption.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.769
I'm sure warden burke
will be very interested

32:52.771 --> 32:54.837
In your creative
attention to detail.

32:55.941 --> 32:58.341
All right.
I took her money.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.277
But I didn't
kill jennifer drask.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.214
The night she died,
I was dining at chez pierre.

33:05.250 --> 33:08.051
Even if that is true,
you'll still be fired.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.620
For what?

33:10.622 --> 33:12.756
I was just doing my job.

33:12.891 --> 33:15.892
You were sterilizing
women against their will.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.894
As mandated by
the mercer reformatory,

33:17.896 --> 33:21.097
An institution that values
my vision and expertise.

33:21.133 --> 33:24.034
And what exactly
is your vision?

33:24.036 --> 33:27.303
A society unburdened
by the morally unfit.

33:27.373 --> 33:30.907
I'll not stand idly by
while habitual criminals

33:31.043 --> 33:33.676
Pollute our world
with their offspring.

33:36.648 --> 33:37.814
I agree.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.583
The woman's philosophies
are despicable.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.451
The entire system
is despicable.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.386
The entire
system can wait.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.188
Because right now
I just need you

33:45.323 --> 33:47.190
To solve this
particular murder.

33:47.326 --> 33:50.026
Well, how could jennifer
have smuggled in

33:50.029 --> 33:51.628
This money to pay
off the doctor?

34:01.640 --> 34:03.006
"corktown provisions."

34:03.141 --> 34:05.241
Looks like you're going
shopping, me ol' mucker.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.416
Mr. Redbird?

34:19.391 --> 34:21.024
Mr. Redbird, stop!

34:21.026 --> 34:22.892
Turn around.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.330
Please,
don't take him away.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.839
Murdoch: You didn't tell me
your and edna's son survived.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.374
Well, you didn't ask.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.876
So, it's not
exactly a lie.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.848
But I did lie
about jennifer drask.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.584
Murdoch:
So, you knew her?

34:47.586 --> 34:49.452
She was blackmailing edna.

34:49.521 --> 34:53.857
She said if
children's aid found out

34:53.859 --> 34:55.525
That our son was alive,

34:55.561 --> 34:57.593
They'd take him away.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.396
So, you paid her?

35:00.466 --> 35:02.599
What would you do
if it was your boy?

35:06.004 --> 35:08.738
First jennifer
took edna's ring.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.875
Then she took
all the money we had.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.878
We gave her everything
to protect charlie.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.947
But we had nothing
to do with her death.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.151
You checked my alibi.

35:22.187 --> 35:26.322
Please, just let me
take my son home.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.029
Thank you for your time,
mr. Redbird.

35:33.164 --> 35:33.996
Mm-hm.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.034
We'll contact you if we
have any further questions.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.102
All right.

35:41.973 --> 35:42.906
Come on, charlie.

35:47.079 --> 35:47.978
Let's go home.

35:52.484 --> 35:55.184
So, the money jennifer drask
used to bribe dr. Cotton

35:55.220 --> 35:58.254
Was in fact
leon redbird's savings.

35:58.256 --> 36:01.791
Miss drask had been
blackmailing edna emerson

36:01.860 --> 36:03.527
By threatening to
expose the fact

36:03.662 --> 36:05.595
That her son
had survived.

36:05.631 --> 36:08.064
Blackmail gives emerson
a motive to kill drask.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.233
But edna didn't have
access to the syringe

36:10.302 --> 36:13.136
Or the sedatives that were
found in jennifer's system.

36:13.138 --> 36:15.471
Nor could she have carried
the body to the tracks.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.807
And leon redbird
had an alibi,

36:17.876 --> 36:19.743
So he couldn't have
done it, either.

36:19.878 --> 36:23.145
I'm just stunned that edna
managed to smuggle her baby

36:23.182 --> 36:24.414
Out of that dungeon.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.949
She must have had help.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.084
Anyone who helped her could be
another potential target

36:28.220 --> 36:30.019
Of jennifer drask's extortion.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.489
Someone had to have signed
the baby's death certificate.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.726
Let's have a look
at edna's medical file.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.300
And here it is. Stillbirth.

36:43.302 --> 36:46.937
Signed by
adelina dimartino.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.304
The nurse.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.143
You see how happy he is?

36:53.145 --> 36:55.779
How does one determine
whether a peacock is happy?

36:55.781 --> 36:57.113
By his strut.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.718
So, I suppose our
adventure ends here.

37:01.853 --> 37:02.919
Oh, it doesn't have to.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.724
-Oh!
-I hope you will attend.

37:07.859 --> 37:08.824
Watts:
Huh.

37:11.163 --> 37:13.763
Thank you for taking me
seriously, detective watts.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.399
And thank you
for granting me

37:16.435 --> 37:19.435
A reprieve from seriousness,
mr. Strange.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.406
Oh! Fix your latch.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.709
All right.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.346
I can't find
adelina anywhere.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.749
I have looked upstairs,
downstairs,

37:32.751 --> 37:35.285
The kitchen,
the sewing room, the laundry.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.687
I have searched
absolutely everywhere!

37:37.723 --> 37:39.289
Julia?

37:39.291 --> 37:40.490
The roof.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.263
Adelina!

37:47.299 --> 37:50.700
Miss dimartino,
step away from the edge.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.736
It's all my fault,
you know.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.171
The death of miss drask?

37:56.841 --> 37:58.708
She fell right here.

37:58.843 --> 38:01.711
I heard her head
hit the ground.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.512
Crack!

38:03.548 --> 38:06.382
I still hear it
over and over.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.252
If jennifer fell,
it is not your fault.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.154
Yes, it is.

38:11.223 --> 38:14.324
She wanted money to keep
quiet about edna's baby.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.725
We came here to talk.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.393
She started yelling
her demands

38:17.529 --> 38:20.229
And I gave her a shot
to calm her down.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.065
She lost her balance.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.200
She fell right here.

38:24.269 --> 38:26.202
I heard her head
hit the ground.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.670
Crack.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.745
Please, adelina,
just take one step down.

38:38.483 --> 38:42.418
This place is evil
and nobody cares.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.120
I care!

38:44.189 --> 38:46.489
And I'll do
everything in my power

38:46.525 --> 38:47.891
To see that you receive

38:48.026 --> 38:50.025
The most lenient
sentence possible.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.497
Everything in your power.

38:54.566 --> 38:57.500
What power do you have?

38:57.635 --> 38:59.002
Not as much
as I'd like sometimes,

38:59.137 --> 39:02.304
But, please, adelina,

39:02.341 --> 39:05.375
I do believe that women
can change the world.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.344
But first we have to start
trusting each other.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.914
Please!

39:29.267 --> 39:30.332
Are you all right?

39:31.970 --> 39:33.937
I just wanted
to help those women.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.605
You did.

With every small gesture
of compassion you offered them.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.746
I wanted to show
you something.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.015
I recruited a lawyer
friend of mine.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.818
We lodged
an emergency petition.

39:48.820 --> 39:52.088
With my testimony,
we believe we can secure

39:52.223 --> 39:55.958
Edna's release and have her
reunited with her family.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.897
Maybe you do
really have power.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.565
It's not just my doing.

40:02.700 --> 40:05.101
You helped to keep
that family together.

Thank you, dr. Ogden.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.851
But what about the others?

40:21.853 --> 40:24.587
Who will speak for all
the other incorrigible women?

40:35.200 --> 40:36.933
It's a small gathering,
informal,

40:37.068 --> 40:39.602
And it sounds
like a lot of fun.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.804
You remember fun,
don't you?

40:41.807 --> 40:44.073
I can't.
I have family obligations.

You're a married man, jack,

two hours with you.

You don't have to
fuss over me.

Anything I can do to put
a smile on my wife's face

41:33.057 --> 41:34.724
Is no fuss at all.

What did the men you've
hired been telling you?

41:54.813 --> 41:58.080
They found him.
In winnipeg.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.283
What?

42:00.352 --> 42:01.751
Bobby's in winnipeg?

42:01.820 --> 42:03.286
He was.

42:03.288 --> 42:05.021
He got wind that
I was looking for him.

42:05.090 --> 42:06.956
He ran off again.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.758
Why did he run?

bobby's life is his own

42:12.230 --> 42:14.764
To salvage or destroy.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.632
There's nothing
we can do about it.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.901
We could help him.

No we can't.

Not unless he wants it.

It's the truth.
