I'm so sorry.

42:17.102 --> 42:20.103
That baby will never know
how special she was.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.205
He will.

42:22.207 --> 42:25.275
He will,
because you'll tell him.

42:25.277 --> 42:27.176
She saw him.

42:27.178 --> 42:28.845
That's good, right?

42:28.847 --> 42:31.114
That's better than good.
