00:01.919 --> 00:03.546
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.879 --> 00:04.971
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.130 --> 00:08.930
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.092 --> 00:11.265
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:13.396
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:15.683
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

00:15.933 --> 00:17.935
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.143 --> 00:20.271
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:21.981
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:22.147 --> 00:23.148
What are you doing in Russia?

00:23.315 --> 00:24.942
I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

00:25.108 --> 00:28.362
Only people who have power
to get past his army are Bratva.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.826
We lost one. It's in the air.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.240
You need to divert that missile.

00:32.616 --> 00:33.833
That's it.

00:36.245 --> 00:39.624
<i>Tobias Church, he and his crew
tore up Hub City and Blüdhaven.</i>

00:39.790 --> 00:41.212
Anybody else want to be in charge?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.922
Church just became our top priority.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.884
Felicity thinks that it's time
we put together a new team.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.720
Evelyn Sharp. Basically,
a 16-year-old badass in the making.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.055
<i>Until her parents
met Damien Darhk I'm guessing.</i>

00:53.637 --> 00:54.684
You recruit me too.

00:54.846 --> 00:55.813
You wanna help?

00:55.973 --> 00:57.190
It's my city too.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.359
I don't want to
see you out here again.

01:41.685 --> 01:42.811
You again?

01:42.978 --> 01:44.480
How's the leg?

01:45.689 --> 01:47.987
You call yourself a vigilante?

01:48.150 --> 01:50.494
You just let the Halcones' top seller
get away.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.285
Now I thought I said that I didn't
want to see you out here again.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.670
You don't listen very well.

01:59.870 --> 02:00.871
You sound like my ex.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.626
Rene Ramirez, you need to decide

02:04.791 --> 02:07.715
if you want to be a man in a hockey mask

02:08.919 --> 02:10.672
or if you want to be someone else.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.300
Something else.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.741
Conahan was struck
with an arrow and a sword.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.372
Literally overkill.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.916
<i>Definitely not Church's M. O.</i>

02:38.116 --> 02:40.118
Totally different than
the Bertinelli murder too.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.208
Ballistics show
that he was shot by his own men.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.543
Well, that had to be Church.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.423
In Hub City,
he killed every crime boss in town

02:45.582 --> 02:48.711
so he could unite everyone
under one super-gang under his control.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.220
How does he do this?

02:51.421 --> 02:52.843
It's all in the core.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.099
So, Curtis,

02:58.261 --> 03:00.605
I'm guessing this wasn't
part of your Olympic training?

03:06.687 --> 03:07.779
Impossible.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.942
It's really hot. I mean, not. It's not.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.324
Curtis, if you think this is hard

03:15.487 --> 03:16.784
wait until I actually start training you.

03:16.947 --> 03:17.948
What happens then?

03:18.115 --> 03:20.083
The last guy got an arrow
in the leg before it even started.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.243
That was Roy, right?

03:21.410 --> 03:22.878
Also Roy, but I'm talking about Wild Dog.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.297
And you did put two arrows
in Barry Allen's back.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.627
I'm starting to sense a pattern.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.042
Don't worry.
His bark's way worse than his bite.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.300
And you're gonna get it worse than anyone.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.506
Uh... Thanks?

03:30.669 --> 03:33.388
The people that we're looking at have
at least some experience on the street.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.391
You have the farthest way to go before
I'm convinced that you can do this.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.592
I can do it, sir.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.477
- Don't call me sir.
- Okay, Oliver.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.309
Don't call me Oliver especially
in front of the recruits.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.893
We don't know these people
and they can't know us.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.478
Whoa, whoa! Hold up.
You're going to be wearing a mask

03:44.641 --> 03:45.642
when you training our recruits?

03:45.809 --> 03:47.152
Yeah. And so are you.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.402
I only wear a mask once a year

03:48.562 --> 03:49.779
and that's if my Halloween costume
calls for it.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.158
This is not negotiable, Felicity.
I'm late for a budget meeting.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.488
Yeah.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.952
And I'm sure that kicking things off

04:00.115 --> 04:04.621
by lying to everyone is an awesome idea.

04:04.828 --> 04:09.004
Well, the original team started off
with Oliver lying about his identity.

04:09.166 --> 04:13.672
And everyone who's not dead or
presumed dead, quit.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.630
Yeah.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.637
Now this trigger was taken from one of the
nukes that fell on Genesis Day.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.980
Our intel tells us that a group of
Chechen rebels is close to obtaining it.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.438
I don't have to tell you what
kind of a nightmare scenario will ensue

04:30.604 --> 04:32.481
if that happens.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.491
Now the mission
is standard retrieval and extraction.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.700
Sergeant Diggle here, will be running
the op, wheels up at 0400.

04:39.905 --> 04:44.160
All right, gentlemen, get some rest.
You're gonna need it. Dismissed!

04:54.169 --> 04:55.842
You good, soldier?

04:57.088 --> 04:59.807
I got through basic training, no sweat.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.224
But this is my first day in the soup

05:04.304 --> 05:06.773
and I don't want to be scared,
but I am a little.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.311
Fear is part of war.
The part that keeps us alive.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.444
See these stripes?

05:14.606 --> 05:16.904
They give me strength, clarity.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.987
Right or wrong, up and down,

05:20.987 --> 05:22.113
they tell me what to do.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.575
Which means that fear can kiss my six.
You understand, soldier?

05:25.742 --> 05:28.086
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Dismissed.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.550
It used to be that the Glades
were the worst part of the city,

05:37.712 --> 05:40.090
but now it seems like
every other part is just as bad.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.852
We've had three hospital closures
in the past eighteen months.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.557
But with a Free Medical Clinic
event like this

05:45.720 --> 05:47.643
we can start to walk back
some of that damage.

05:47.806 --> 05:52.107
In a day, we can provide
medical care for up to a thousand people.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.773
Plus, we already have about 30 doctors
and nurses just waiting to volunteer.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.283
We're looking for a company
to cover logistical expenses and...

05:58.441 --> 06:00.193
I don't need to hear any more.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.407
AmerTek is in.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.619
And not just for logistical expenses,
for the whole thing.

06:04.823 --> 06:05.915
Well, that's amazing.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.576
That's, that's incredibly generous,
thank you.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.244
Please, you would be doing us the favor.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.209
And by "us" she means our stock price.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.998
Good PR is worth, literally,
its weight in gold.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.132
Uh, well, we will make sure
this clinic is a success

06:15.292 --> 06:17.966
and that everyone knows
they have AmerTek to thank for it.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.129
Wow.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.052
Thought I'd almost feel bad
about boosting their stock prices

06:22.215 --> 06:25.594
if it wasn't so good
for your approval ratings.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.559
But actually you should really handle
the press on this one.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.565
Maybe you can?

06:30.974 --> 06:33.272
Oh, God, Ollie, I really thought
that we talked about this.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.813
I can't keep doing everything on my own!

06:35.979 --> 06:39.984
I have faith that you can, but
either way now is not a very good time.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.276
And why is that?

06:41.443 --> 06:43.491
- I'm recruiting a new team.
- Oh.

06:44.696 --> 06:45.993
You okay with that?

06:46.156 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, why wouldn't I be? I quit.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.545
I know, but there's a difference
between leaving and being replaced.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.830
Oh.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.249
It's really cute you think
I can be replaced.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.417
That's not what I meant.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.303
I know. But I actually think
it'll be really good for you

07:00.462 --> 07:02.385
to not be out there solo anymore.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.134
Plus, it would mean you would have
more time to actually be here.

07:06.301 --> 07:10.147
That's the idea. But it's going to take
a minute to get these kids up to speed.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.104
Wait, maybe I should hire my own team
for the office then.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.065
That's also a good idea.
Start looking at résumés.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.238
Hey, Quentin.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.152
Have you actually heard about

07:24.319 --> 07:26.742
this free medical event
Ollie and I are putting together?

07:29.032 --> 07:31.251
- Rene Ramirez?
- Yeah.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.292
Figures there'd be more of you.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.707
Robin Hood needs his band of Merry Men,
right?

07:36.873 --> 07:38.716
Well, I am just here for moral support.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.798
She means she's here to make sure

07:40.961 --> 07:43.055
that the Green Arrow's training technique
doesn't kill us.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.510
He's not going to kill you.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.394
I'm just here to make sure that the
horrible maiming stays a minimum.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.970
I'm Curtis.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.771
Evelyn Sharp.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.729
So wait, there's training? I'm out.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.402
Pretty early to quit, Mr. Ramirez.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.813
I can't quit something I haven't started.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.402
You think you can do this on your own?

08:01.564 --> 08:03.692
I've been doing this on my own
for five months now.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.737
And if you were getting it done
on your own, you wouldn't have come here.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.240
I'm out of here.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.081
- No mask?
- No chance.

08:18.873 --> 08:19.920
On the line.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.836
Wait. I thought there was gonna be,

08:23.003 --> 08:25.222
I dunno, like an orientation?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.474
Is that what the brochure promised?

08:28.091 --> 08:30.435
- That's hilarious. He's good...
- On the line!

08:33.888 --> 08:35.606
This is simple.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.979
Get past me

08:38.768 --> 08:40.270
and ring that bell.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.984
So, we're playing games now?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.446
Fine. I'll play.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.921
On the line.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.009
At least he's not shooting them.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.472
On the line.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.013
This is stupid.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.144
Still think it's a game?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.647
I came here to work with the guy
who killed Damien Darhk

09:15.805 --> 09:16.806
not ring a friggin' bell.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.227
This isn't a game.
And if you need further evidence of that

09:20.435 --> 09:22.483
then you walk down to the pier

09:22.645 --> 09:24.943
and you look at the statue
of Laurel Lance.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.279
Now, get on the line!

10:16.783 --> 10:20.413
I'd love to, but I can't tonight.
Too much to do for this medical event.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.252
Yeah, it's great, Janet agreed to it.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.382
All right, see you Saturday?

10:35.301 --> 10:36.598
Here you go, bud.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.607
How's the victim?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.910
Victim is Evan Wender. He's in the ICU.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.742
Doctors think that
he was suffocated by something.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.781
Is that lining up
with anything you've found?

10:56.948 --> 10:58.916
You're assuming
I've actually found anything.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.201
What's your interest in this, anyway?

11:00.368 --> 11:01.836
AmerTek is helping us with a charity event

11:01.995 --> 11:04.293
and all of a sudden one of their
Vice Presidents is attacked.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.923
It cannot be a coincidence.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.504
Not in this city.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.171
- I have to go.
- Bye.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.404
Thanks.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.899
We're very sorry
about what happened to Mr. Wender.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.160
But I would like you to know that I've
assigned the Anti-Crime Unit to his case

11:34.319 --> 11:37.289
and I've asked them to make catching
whoever did this their top priority.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.286
Well, I appreciate that.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.493
But in the wake of this recent development

11:41.659 --> 11:45.084
my board of directors, to say nothing
of AmerTek's army of attorneys

11:45.246 --> 11:47.248
have advised us to
pull out of tomorrow's event.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.213
They're concerned that
the attack on Mr. Wender

11:49.375 --> 11:51.173
could be the start of a larger
pattern of violence.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.556
And if something were to happen during the
Clinic, then AmerTek would be held liable.

11:56.466 --> 12:00.391
What if Star City
agrees to indemnify AmerTek?

12:00.553 --> 12:01.770
Ollie, that could cost millions.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.433
And I will triple
the police presence at the event.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.230
There will be plenty of security?

12:06.476 --> 12:07.898
I will see to it personally.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.272
Well.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.942
I'm going to hold you to that, Mr. Mayor.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.076
Thank you.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.664
So is the plan,
to see to it personally with a new team?

12:23.826 --> 12:25.169
No. They're nowhere near ready.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.545
Then what's the back-up plan?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.716
Me. It's one of the advantages

12:29.874 --> 12:32.047
of having the mayor
moonlighting as a vigilante.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.846
Or the vigilante moonlighting as mayor.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.846
No hostiles, sir. We're a go.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.011
Excellent. Intel was good.
Hostiles are on a shift change.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.397
Bravo Team, you're upstairs,
northwest corridor, second floor.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.057
Alpha Team with me, look sharp.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.366
Alpha Team is here.
Bravo Team, where are you, what's your...

13:06.202 --> 13:08.330
Come on! Move! Move! Move!

13:09.664 --> 13:11.291
How the hell did they know we were here?

13:19.549 --> 13:20.926
On the line.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.846
Here to learn something, man.
Not just get beat up.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.857
I told you, I'm teaching you.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.564
Teaching us what exactly?

13:30.727 --> 13:33.901
Because I actually find myself
agreeing with the scary, weird guy.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.617
The goal of this exercise

13:37.775 --> 13:40.745
is to figure out
the goal of this exercise.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.830
Now, get on the line.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.539
Actually, Green Arrow?
Can I talk to you for a second?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.086
Now?

13:51.039 --> 13:54.009
You know, I thought maybe we could hold
off on the criticism for a little bit.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.592
Oh, yeah, no problem 'cause there's a lot.
Look.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.094
I thought there wasn't any usable footage
from traffic cameras.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.101
Yeah, but who needs traffic cams when you
got KH-ten spy satellites?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.097
Could be a meta.
Or magic of some sort.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.893
Exactly. So Thea may or may not have told
me about your brilliant plan

14:11.059 --> 14:13.278
to protect the Free Clinic
all by yourself.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.656
I won't be all by myself.
I'll have the SCPD and the ACU.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.782
No way!
This is out of both of their leagues.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.119
What?

14:22.362 --> 14:25.787
It's out of their league too.
They're too green.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.666
Some could say the same about you.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.455
I've been waiting five years
to make that joke.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.963
The convention center
has twenty entrances.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.251
You can't be on them all.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.467
Throw them around the perimeter for three
extra pairs of eyes. What could it hurt?

14:45.343 --> 14:48.472
<i>Okay, heads on swivels.
But do not engage under any circumstances.</i>

14:48.679 --> 14:52.604
- Copy that.
- Yes, sir. I mean, I mean, Green Arrow.

14:52.767 --> 14:53.984
Wild Dog, do you copy that?

14:54.143 --> 14:57.067
- We gotta talk about this code name.
- Not now. <i>Stay</i> focused.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.903
You know, it'd help to know where you are.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.067
<i>No, it wouldn't because
you are not going to engage.</i>

15:01.234 --> 15:02.952
Come on, where's the fun in that?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.529
<i>Man,
it would take one major asshat</i>

15:04.695 --> 15:06.493
<i>to make a move against all these people.</i>

15:06.656 --> 15:09.284
<i>Something I learned recently
is this city is filled with them.</i>

15:10.159 --> 15:12.833
It starts at the top, you know?

15:13.413 --> 15:16.383
Pretty Boy Queen here thinks
he's actually saving the city.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.047
Thank you, Officer. Hey.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.096
How are you? Hello.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.302
What have we here?

15:27.468 --> 15:28.720
Oh. Her broken bone never set.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.184
Oh. You'll be fine.
I have some experience with that.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.518
Evelyn, check the northwest corridor.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.686
I don't get a code name?

15:36.853 --> 15:39.197
We really thank you for sticking with us.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.526
Oh. Well, I'm glad
that Oliver changed my mind.

15:42.692 --> 15:46.287
It's nice to feel that this company
can still do some good.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.740
Um, sorry I'm late.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.043
If you'll excuse me.
The event is almost over.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.875
Yeah, I know.
It's been that kind of traffic, you know?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.085
Yeah, but you were supposed to watch
the Tenth Street entrance.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.876
But I just said, this traffic,
it's terrible!

16:00.209 --> 16:01.586
Are you okay?

16:01.752 --> 16:04.130
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, you know?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.220
Sorry, it won't happen again.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.552
Yeah, but...

16:09.510 --> 16:12.389
You haven't been drinking again, have you?

16:20.563 --> 16:23.863
<i>Janet Carroll.
You have been judged and found wanting.</i>

16:26.944 --> 16:28.321
He's here.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.583
Son of a bitch!

16:39.373 --> 16:40.374
GREEN ARROW; Overwatch?

16:40.583 --> 16:44.053
I don't see him on any of the security
cameras. It's like he just disappeared.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.259
<i>I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see him</i>

16:45.421 --> 16:47.219
<i>do all that other stuff
that I don't believe.</i>

16:51.677 --> 16:53.771
I'm almost afraid to ask... Actually,

16:53.930 --> 16:56.809
I am afraid to ask.
You know, maybe I'm just afraid.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.066
Is he coming?

16:58.226 --> 16:59.694
He's on his way.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.321
Did he sound unhappy?

17:03.773 --> 17:05.695
Why did you do that anyway?

17:05.858 --> 17:08.656
He specifically told us not to engage.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.038
First, he's not the boss of me
and never will be.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.246
Second, if he thinks I'm just gonna stand
back and watch some little girl get hurt

17:14.407 --> 17:16.251
then he never should've
recruited me in the first place.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.208
I think that's quickly becoming
the majority opinion.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.545
Third, if I hadn't done what I did,
I wouldn't have gotten this.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.050
Wait. Is that a piece of...

17:23.209 --> 17:24.506
Yeah. Ragman.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.012
Now, I may be new at this and all

17:26.170 --> 17:27.843
but isn't that
what you guys call "evidence"?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.131
On the line!

17:29.298 --> 17:30.515
Listen, before you say anything,
I think you...

17:30.675 --> 17:32.473
My instructions were specific.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.479
By not listening,
you put every one of our lives at risk.

17:35.638 --> 17:36.810
You need to calm down.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.145
Now, I know
that none of you are ready for this.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.025
But now I'm not sure
if you're ever going to be.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.859
Because you are reckless. You're useless
if you're not behind a computer

17:44.021 --> 17:45.648
and you are just a little girl

17:45.815 --> 17:48.068
who should be doing something better
with her life.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.579
Okay, that's enough pep talk for one day.
Can I talk to you for a second?

17:56.158 --> 17:58.581
Did you learn nothing from what happened
with Curtis last year?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.587
You know I don't have a bedside manner...

18:00.746 --> 18:01.838
There's having no bedside manner

18:01.998 --> 18:04.000
and then there is being
physically and emotionally abusive.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.386
It took me five years in hell to turn into
someone capable of going out there.

18:07.545 --> 18:10.719
You know who didn't have five years?
Laurel Lance.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.056
And now she's dead.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.017
Well, were those five years just full of
pain and suffering

18:17.179 --> 18:18.931
or did you have someone who taught you?

18:19.098 --> 18:23.353
I had a few people who taught me
and I'm trying to teach them.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.863
What? To take a punch? An insult?

18:26.022 --> 18:28.946
You keep expecting them to do
what you're telling them to do.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.360
And then you're not giving them
any reason.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.279
You just keep jabbing them with
a cattle-prod expecting them to perform.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.791
And the guy that you called reckless
got us our only clue we have so far.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.166
We need to do a full work-up on that.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.331
Yeah, well, I can't, I mean, not here.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.216
The Ghosts
destroyed our Gas chromatograph.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.549
But, uh, I have other methods.

18:50.338 --> 18:53.467
Good. I have to get to City Hall.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.135
What about them?

18:56.385 --> 18:59.264
The city just experienced the equivalent
of a terrorist attack.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.395
Those three can wait.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.395
<i>You should get to the medic tent
when we get back,</i>

19:05.561 --> 19:07.188
<i>but this should hold you for a few hours.</i>

19:07.355 --> 19:09.198
A few hours, why? We're not bugging out?

19:09.357 --> 19:11.860
Our orders are to get that trigger,
that's exactly what we're going to do.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.027
All the men are on the second floor,

19:13.194 --> 19:14.411
we have no idea how
many guys are up there.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.787
Do you remember
what I told you about fear?

19:16.364 --> 19:17.866
- Gets you through.
- That's right.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.455
And so does the chain of command.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.415
We don't have to think about do or don't,
right or wrong.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.628
There's a clarity in that, right?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.633
A peace.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.091
Do you understand?

19:33.089 --> 19:34.261
Fall out.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.474
Secure the south hallways.
I'll take the north.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.098
<i>Contacts will be here any minute.</i>

19:42.264 --> 19:44.266
<i>So let's keep our heads
on swivels, ladies.</i>

19:45.726 --> 19:47.353
Thought you guys were either dead or gone.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.899
Collins took a through-and-through.
He'll fine but...

19:51.065 --> 19:52.157
What the hell is going on here?

19:52.316 --> 19:53.989
Really sorry about this, Sergeant.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.869
You're not here to secure the trigger.
You're stealing it.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.242
Can't steal anything if nobody owns it.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.872
Now, you be careful now, Sergeant.
You just might live through this.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.464
Not that I would normally condone
drinking this much caffeine

20:11.627 --> 20:14.426
but since you are so busy
trying to save the entire city and all...

20:14.588 --> 20:16.886
Add it to the list of vices
I've been meaning to swear off.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.801
Oh! Do I even want to know?

20:18.968 --> 20:21.221
Just as much as I want to know
why you're really here.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.106
You already bought me an Americano
this morning before I got to work.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.144
Ah! And that's why you are the detective.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.064
It's been a while since I dated anyone.
Is this a thing now?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.359
No, this is not a thing. This is

20:36.402 --> 20:38.951
a very long, funny story.

20:39.113 --> 20:42.083
Do you want to tell me this story?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.494
Yeah, it's why I'm here. Um...

20:44.660 --> 20:49.336
This belonged to my friend's maid.
Cleaning lady.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.300
Your friend's cleaning lady?

20:51.459 --> 20:54.633
She's gone missing.
And he's very worried about her.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.214
You want me to make a report to
Missing Persons?

20:57.381 --> 20:58.553
No, no, no! I was thinking that...

20:58.716 --> 20:59.888
Well, she left this rag behind.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.771
So I was thinking there might be some
evidence left behind on it that, um,

21:04.764 --> 21:06.357
could help my friend locate
her cleaning lady.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.517
I thought your friend was a guy.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.690
Are you jealous?

21:10.895 --> 21:14.320
Only insofar as I haven't actually met
any of your friends yet.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.529
Mmm.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.114
And yes, that's a hint
officially being dropped.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.446
Hint noted.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.830
Okay.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.452
So just a quick forensic work-up?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.962
Like, maybe just a quick pass
through the gas chromatograph?

21:29.997 --> 21:32.250
Fine. It's your tax dollars.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.719
You are the best.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.099
Thea, may I speak with...

21:40.341 --> 21:41.467
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.146
- Oh, I was just leaving.
Is everything okay?

21:45.387 --> 21:46.889
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.933
I was just talking to Thea
about maybe coming aboard,

21:49.099 --> 21:51.727
- helping out with some stuff and...
- Yeah.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.231
Yeah, anyway.
So anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.774
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.651
Uh, thanks.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.538
- What was that about?
- It's nothing.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.245
Look, we have way bigger problems
on our plate right now.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.910
Because of you we are on the hook
with AmerTek

22:08.077 --> 22:09.545
and the CEO is in the hospital.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.252
Actually, she was just released,
she's fine.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.088
Okay, but she's gonna hit the city
with a multi-million dollar lawsuit.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.879
Well, can you speak to her?
My hands are kind of full right now.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.763
Okay. What else is new?

22:20.047 --> 22:21.344
What is going on with Quentin?

22:21.507 --> 22:24.226
I am 90% sure
he's drinking again.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.432
And I'm 100% sure.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.602
He told me when I saw him last week.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.434
Ollie, I put him to work security
at the event...

22:32.434 --> 22:34.528
The dude in rags came in through the door

22:34.687 --> 22:36.439
he was supposed to be working.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.240
Thea, I'm sorry.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.442
I had no idea
that you were gonna reach out to him.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.782
But why is he talking
like he's going to be working with us?

22:42.945 --> 22:44.697
"I'll see you tomorrow"? What, is that?

22:46.407 --> 22:47.454
He's hurting, Ollie.

22:47.616 --> 22:48.708
But <i>I</i> don't think that putting him

22:48.868 --> 22:51.121
in a position of responsibility
is the best idea for him,

22:51.287 --> 22:54.382
or for us right now. Okay?

22:55.291 --> 22:56.417
I'll talk 110 him.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.388
I have to go. Thank you.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.140
What's going on? Where are the others?

23:07.303 --> 23:08.680
Somewhere not here.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.146
They quit.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.729
This really shouldn't come
as any sort of surprise to you.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.361
It's not surprising.
We chose the wrong people.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.317
- Including me, right?
- Curtis,

23:18.397 --> 23:21.116
do you know what the purpose
of this exercise is?

23:21.775 --> 23:23.493
To figure out the purpose
of this exercise?

23:23.652 --> 23:24.995
No. It's to work together

23:25.154 --> 23:26.656
because that's the only way that you win.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.790
That is what I've been trying
to teach all of you.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.826
Well, maybe there's a reason
why you couldn't.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.460
- We don't trust you.
- That's on you.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.340
No, man, that's on you.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.340
Because you don't trust us.
Because you don't want us.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.301
Okay, this is a setback.
But we can salvage this. Like...

23:43.464 --> 23:44.556
They'll listen to you.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.968
Can you just tell them how Oliver usually
approaches things and...

23:47.134 --> 23:48.431
I tried that.

23:48.969 --> 23:53.224
I told them all about how you
and Speedy and Spartan were a family.

23:53.390 --> 23:57.987
And even though you were tough
and scary and even a little abusive,

23:58.187 --> 24:01.031
they clearly trusted you
because they stood by you.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.368
But then it hit me.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.612
No, they didn't.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.117
They left.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.406
And now I know why.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.042
You don't respect people.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.544
You don't know how to have partners.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.581
You don't build people up.
You tear them down.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.838
I thought I could trust you,

24:20.626 --> 24:21.923
we could trust you,

24:23.545 --> 24:24.546
but I was wrong.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.760
And that's why I'm out too.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.484
<i>Figured I'd find you here.</i>

24:40.646 --> 24:41.772
You were right.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.777
Oh. As much as I usually love
hearing those three little words,

24:46.402 --> 24:48.871
gloating right now
would be like kicking a puppy.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.284
I failed these recruits as a leader.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.077
Well, that's 'cause you're not a leader.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.213
Well, in your defense,
you never set out to be.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.921
You never planned
on doing this with partners.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.595
Though, I don't think
you really ever had a way

25:04.753 --> 25:06.801
- around that one.
- How so?

25:07.673 --> 25:12.019
When I got to know you, the real you...

25:16.932 --> 25:18.024
I was in awe.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.487
I had never met somebody so passionate,

25:23.939 --> 25:28.115
so focused and determined
to make a real difference.

25:29.570 --> 25:30.867
But the recruits

25:31.780 --> 25:33.657
didn't get to see the real you

25:33.824 --> 25:37.499
because all you showed them
was this angry guy in a mask.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.958
Like scary angry-

25:39.121 --> 25:42.671
I just thought that if they didn't know
who I was it would make things easier.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.551
How would that make things
easier for them?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.633
For me. Easier for me.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.176
- When I was in the Bratva...
- Mmm.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.768
You never talk about your time in Russia.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.355
Nobody in the Bratva
uses their real names.

26:02.311 --> 26:05.406
Nobody knows anything about anyone's life

26:05.564 --> 26:07.282
before they were Bratva.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.907
- Sounds lonely.
- It's effective.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.708
They teach you that the only person
you can trust is yourself.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.540
That without personal attachment,

26:20.204 --> 26:22.332
there can be no loss.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.261
Laurel,

26:28.962 --> 26:31.431
Thea, Digg, even Roy.

26:32.091 --> 26:35.641
I let them into my crusade,
I let them in...

26:35.803 --> 26:36.850
And they left.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.312
I was protecting myself.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.560
I just think you're missing something.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.195
Only one thing?

26:48.690 --> 26:51.034
The reason the original team
worked so well,

26:54.488 --> 26:56.707
was because of the trust and respect

26:56.865 --> 26:58.959
that everyone had for Oliver Queen,

27:00.285 --> 27:01.377
not the Green Arrow.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.383
Oliver is the one who makes a good leader.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.460
He's the one that runs a good team.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.470
He's the one that I chose to stand by

27:10.629 --> 27:12.757
and that I continue to choose to stand by.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.723
I got to take this.

27:39.575 --> 27:43.876
Hey, hey. If we can move them
to the left, we may have a chance.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.291
We need to divert their attention

27:47.499 --> 27:49.797
and then one of us sneaks past
and we ring the bell.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.135
Congratulations, Oliver.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.342
Well, it looks
like we have our work cut for us

28:38.508 --> 28:40.556
getting AmerTek back in our good graces.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.346
Couldn't even get past the reception desk.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.150
So we need
to get this handled with... But...

28:49.311 --> 28:50.984
Just call me back whenever you get this.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.155
I'm sorry I'm late.
It couldn't be helped.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.495
Help it next time.
I don't like waiting.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.285
<i>Are we all set for tonight?</i>

29:04.451 --> 29:05.998
We are if you have the money.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.539
$100 million.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.834
For everything I need
to take over this city.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.303
Mr. Church, I'm selling you

29:14.461 --> 29:16.555
enough ordinance to take over a country.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.517
Argh. Sons of bitches are late.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.348
Go topside. See if you can get a visual.

29:26.515 --> 29:27.858
Don't you just hate it when your plan

29:28.016 --> 29:30.895
to steal illegal nuclear technology
hits a snag?

29:31.979 --> 29:33.401
So that ambush, that was you.

29:33.647 --> 29:38.198
You had your own men,
soldiers, brothers walk into a trap.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.738
And I'll carry
that with me till the day I die.

29:41.947 --> 29:45.076
But till that day comes,
I'm going to be a very, very wealthy man.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.995
- You swore an oath, man!
- Then Genesis Day happened!

29:48.370 --> 29:52.216
ISIS. Taliban. Al-Qaeda.
I could take 'em all on!

29:52.541 --> 29:55.169
But what hope does the world have
against men with magic?

29:55.711 --> 29:57.930
All those meta-humans in Central City?

29:58.130 --> 30:01.885
How long before one of them,
manages to tear the world apart?

30:05.595 --> 30:07.438
Sarge, what's going on?

30:07.597 --> 30:10.567
It's all right. No! No!

30:10.726 --> 30:13.445
You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

30:14.688 --> 30:16.941
You know, I've been puzzling out

30:17.107 --> 30:19.781
why none of my contacts have showed up,

30:19.943 --> 30:22.617
fretting that maybe this whole thing
had gotten a little bit sideways,

30:22.779 --> 30:24.076
wondering what to do about it.

30:25.115 --> 30:28.745
<i>And you showed up to solve my problem.</i>

30:29.369 --> 30:31.588
Thanks.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.507
So, are you sure that it was them?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.964
Yeah, that son of a bitch
leaves a pretty good impression.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.212
Well, if AmerTek is in bed
with Church, then...

30:39.379 --> 30:41.848
Then maybe that guy in rags isn't so bad.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.759
He's probably trying to take down AmerTek.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.179
So, why is the CEO of a
Fortune 500 company like AmerTek

30:47.346 --> 30:49.895
willing to deal weapons to a crime lord?

30:50.766 --> 30:53.770
Because they are trying
to avoid bankruptcy.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.943
Got the forensics work-up back
on that piece of cloth from Ragman.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.282
Please tell me that's
not what we're actually gonna call him.

30:59.441 --> 31:00.442
What'd you find?

31:00.609 --> 31:02.782
That it is over 2000 years old.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.868
- And radioactive.
- Which means trackable.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.579
If this weapons buy is going down,
this guy's going to try to stop it.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.003
Leading us right
to Janet Carroll and Mr. Church.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.583
Wait. What did you mean when you said

31:12.746 --> 31:14.043
that AmerTek is going bankrupt?

31:14.206 --> 31:17.460
The isotope that made the cloth
radioactive is very specific.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.674
It came from one of the nukes
that Darhk launched on Genesis Day.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.383
Specifically, a nuke manufactured

31:21.546 --> 31:23.264
by a company
called "Atomic Defensive Systems."

31:23.423 --> 31:25.425
They're likely a subsidiary of AmerTek.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.594
Aw! People say he's just a pretty face.

31:27.761 --> 31:28.762
Hmm!

31:29.179 --> 31:32.023
Bottom line is the
subsidiary's connection with Genesis Day

31:32.182 --> 31:34.901
has made AmerTek's stock prices go...

31:35.102 --> 31:38.231
Which explains why they were so eager
to have a big public relations bonanza.

31:38.438 --> 31:42.284
And why they'd be willing to unload
their excess ordinance on Tobias Church.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.444
We need to find our friend in the rags

31:44.611 --> 31:46.238
and hope he leads us to that weapons sale.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.742
Wait! They did just say
that there was enough weaponry

31:49.908 --> 31:51.410
to take down an entire country.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.169
So I would think this would be a good time

31:53.328 --> 31:54.705
for you to test out your new team.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.215
There's no team anymore, Thea.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.211
If I'm going in, I'm going alone.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.517
This is the spot.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.151
<i>There's a crazy amount of hostiles inside.</i>

32:16.309 --> 32:17.356
I say crazy because

32:17.519 --> 32:20.238
that is what you would have to be
to take them on all alone.

32:21.022 --> 32:24.026
All right. You have your merchandise.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.865
And now you want your money.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.288
What kind of dent
can $100 million

32:28.447 --> 32:29.539
make in your balance sheet?

32:29.698 --> 32:33.919
- That's my worry.
- No, I think that's your golden parachute

32:34.411 --> 32:35.708
and I admire that.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.428
Hello, Janet.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.772
Easy. This man's about to
save us $100 million.

32:58.018 --> 33:03.991
They all died in fire. Your fire.
Your weapon. All for your money.

33:09.279 --> 33:10.622
Where you at?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.099
What are you talking about?

33:29.382 --> 33:33.979
I'm talking about a KN-zero-eight.
Your pride and joy.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.061
Over 15,000 missiles
launched on Genesis Day.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.773
Only one found its mark. Yours.

33:39.935 --> 33:43.280
No. No. We built those missiles
to keep people safe.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.069
It was Damien, it was Damien Darhk.

33:45.232 --> 33:48.111
Couldn't have done anything
if you hadn't given him the tools.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.917
Your missile killed everyone in my home.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.504
I am the very last living soul
of Havenrock.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.630
And I carry with me a message

34:09.839 --> 34:12.558
from all those souls you killed.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.362
Ragman!

34:30.527 --> 34:31.824
Thank you.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.661
Thank me
by not standing in my way.

34:34.822 --> 34:35.824
Let her go.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.203
It's over.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.176
Thank you for coming.

34:48.587 --> 34:53.184
Your offer sounded intriguing.
Why'd you make it?

34:53.341 --> 34:55.844
Why did you give up your vengeance
to save my life?

34:56.511 --> 34:58.013
I don't know.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.863
I think it's what my father
would have wanted me to do.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.649
<i>He saved my life.</i>

35:09.065 --> 35:10.237
<i>On Genesis Day</i>

35:13.069 --> 35:15.447
he wrapped me in these rags.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.079
He said they were ancient.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.045
From the time of Devarim.

35:22.203 --> 35:25.753
That they would protect me from the fire.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.258
And they did.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.841
So you see why I have to avenge him?

35:31.004 --> 35:35.555
Your father didn't give up his life
so you could become a killer.

35:35.717 --> 35:36.718
You don't know that.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.729
My father gave up his life to save mine.

35:40.555 --> 35:44.059
He made me promise to be better than him.

35:44.809 --> 35:49.280
To save this city in a way
that he never could.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.489
It's been nearly ten years since that day.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.330
So far, I've failed.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.283
Why are you telling me this?

35:59.449 --> 36:01.952
Because I don't want to fail anymore.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.621
<i>I can't do it alone.</i>

36:05.413 --> 36:07.086
I need a team.

36:09.751 --> 36:12.755
Let's honor the legacies of our fathers.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.091
Together.

36:25.058 --> 36:28.779
Why, Anatoly? Why kill them?

36:28.937 --> 36:31.781
You rang bell. They did not.

36:31.940 --> 36:35.615
I only rang the bell because of them.
I couldn't have done it alone.

36:35.777 --> 36:38.496
But using team was your idea.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.992
You used them to win, huh? Intelligent.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.245
Bratva wants that, Bratva need that.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.332
I never would have done it if I had known

36:48.498 --> 36:50.250
it was gonna cost them their lives.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.044
First part of initiation.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.090
Only person you can trust, yourself.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.147
You seemed
to have re-opened a wound, friend.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.313
What the hell?

37:14.441 --> 37:16.114
Still think you can write
with your cuffs on?

37:16.693 --> 37:18.991
I mean, it wouldn't be much.
Just a signature.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.073
You want to read your confession
before you sign it?

37:22.615 --> 37:24.959
Screw you!

37:26.077 --> 37:28.830
Now, Sergeant,
I am offering you an opportunity here.

37:29.289 --> 37:32.168
I'm not owning up to this. You did this.

37:32.333 --> 37:35.257
Yeah, but I used your gun
to shoot Private Collins.

37:35.545 --> 37:39.095
Apparently, he walked in
on your attempted illegal appropriation

37:39.257 --> 37:41.100
of a WMD for your own personal gain.

37:41.509 --> 37:44.183
I got six men
out there who'll testify to that.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.398
No one will ever believe your story.

37:47.557 --> 37:48.683
I will.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.227
Good luck with your court martial.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.026
Oh, please, come in, sorry.

37:58.193 --> 38:01.322
Sit down and I will be right with you.

38:05.492 --> 38:08.871
Okay, thank you for coming.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.965
Um, yeah, well, I almost didn't.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.710
'Cause, you know, l...

38:15.502 --> 38:17.425
I screwed up, didn't I? People got hurt.

38:18.087 --> 38:20.260
Now it seems like you figured it out that

38:20.507 --> 38:21.759
I'm drinking again and

38:22.091 --> 38:24.389
I understand,
I don't wanna be any trouble.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.681
I'm just sorry it didn't work out.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.938
Okay, Quentin, that's...
It's not gonna work for me.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.645
What?

38:33.812 --> 38:35.689
You leaving
and hitting the bottle again, okay?

38:35.855 --> 38:37.528
No! I think we can do better than that.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.575
- I've been to meetings.
- Not a meeting.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.074
A job.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.870
How does Deputy Mayor sound?

38:46.574 --> 38:51.205
You want to, hire a drunk
to be your deputy mayor, huh?

38:52.413 --> 38:54.586
What, Oliver's approval ratings
are not low enough?

38:54.833 --> 38:57.586
If we were hiring a drunk,
that would be a very good point.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.221
But that is not what we are doing.

39:00.380 --> 39:04.101
We are hiring the former captain
of the SCPD who...

39:04.884 --> 39:07.763
Who just lost his daughter
and is honoring her memory

39:07.929 --> 39:10.307
by dedicating himself
to the city that she loved.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.611
All right, what do you think
about that one?

39:18.815 --> 39:21.785
Why, I think
maybe the wrong Queen ran for mayor.

39:21.943 --> 39:25.538
Look, Ollie, he told me you said,

39:26.364 --> 39:30.460
that you needed a reason
to stay sober, so I...

39:31.786 --> 39:33.459
I thought maybe this could be it.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.713
Yeah, maybe it could.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.637
You let Church almost kill you
so that you could recruit Ragman?

39:44.799 --> 39:47.302
I was betting that his heroism
would trump his vengeance.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.311
That's a big risk
to take on a stranger, don't you think?

39:49.470 --> 39:52.269
Yeah. Well, I'm not done yet.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.981
"- Hey.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.069
- Yeah?
- Are you all right?

39:57.437 --> 39:59.064
Yeah. Fine.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.196
Thank you all for coming.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.613
I only came 'cause blondie said
there'd be an apology.

40:06.779 --> 40:10.283
Well, "blondie" made a good point.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.544
You're not just joining up
with the Green Arrow.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.015
You'd be joining up with me.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.689
The Green Arrow is the Mayor?

40:33.848 --> 40:35.600
I had the same cognitive dissonance.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.110
I hope you don't think I'm gonna apologize

40:37.268 --> 40:38.520
for the trash I talked about you.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.859
No more than I'm going
to apologize for the tough training.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.780
But I understand
that you all need to trust me.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.530
This is as far as I know how to go.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.869
You're sort of asking without asking

40:51.032 --> 40:52.955
if we want to come back, right?

40:53.117 --> 40:54.869
That's exactly what he's doing.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.790
Okay, good. Then I'm in.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.004
Me, too.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.715
Wild Dog?

41:05.129 --> 41:08.349
I'll fight any war long as I trust
who's leading me into battle.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.974
But we have got to rethink this code name.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.024
No chance.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.620
Ah.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.743
Can't stay away from me, can you?

41:36.411 --> 41:38.914
You almost killed
the Green Arrow the other night.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.050
If you had, you'd be dead right now.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.051
Who the hell are...

41:44.919 --> 41:47.092
The Green Arrow is mine.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.175
You kill him, you die.

41:50.425 --> 41:51.927
Who are you?

41:54.095 --> 41:55.938
Prometheus.
