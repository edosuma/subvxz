02:15.802 --> 02:19.272
[Anne] There’s only one person
that we can never escape,

02:19.339 --> 02:21.073
and that’s ourselves.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.910
And we gotta... We have
to love ourselves, right?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.746
There’s no reason to hold on
to all that guilt,

02:26.813 --> 02:29.616
no matter how massive it is.

02:29.716 --> 02:33.052
Now, it’s always important
for us to recognize

02:33.119 --> 02:35.255
when someone isn’t afraid
to do the work.

02:35.388 --> 02:39.926
Someone who isn’t afraid
to face the problem head on.

02:40.026 --> 02:43.096
Karen... Oh,
let’s give her a hand.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.031
[applause]

02:47.033 --> 02:49.169
Nine months sober.
We are so proud of you.

02:49.235 --> 02:51.271
[applause]

02:54.574 --> 02:56.509
Come get this, girl.
You deserve it.

02:56.576 --> 03:00.980
Oh, are you sure? [chuckles]
Yeah, I don’t know.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.516
Okay. [clears throat]

[cell phone chimes]

03:40.553 --> 03:42.388
-Excuse me, Karen.
-Mm!

03:42.522 --> 03:46.225
Sorry, I didn’t mean
to startle you.

03:46.326 --> 03:48.428
Oh, um, it’s all good.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.363
I’m just in my own little world
over here.

03:50.430 --> 03:54.033
[chuckles] I noticed.
Who are you texting?

03:55.835 --> 03:59.305
-Um, my best friend, actually.
-Oh.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.143
You wanna grab a cup of coffee?

04:05.378 --> 04:09.282
-Oh, I, I have a coffee.
-Oh! Right.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.351
-[chuckling]
-Uh...

04:11.451 --> 04:13.786
How about dinner?

04:13.886 --> 04:17.657
Um, you know, Jimmy,
I’m-I’m not really trying

04:17.757 --> 04:21.060
to see anyone right now.

04:21.127 --> 04:24.297
-What do you mean?
-Well, I just mean, my...

04:24.430 --> 04:26.132
My divorce is just finalized,

04:26.232 --> 04:29.302
and I’m, I’m really trying
to focus on myself, is all.

04:29.402 --> 04:32.772
Just dinner.
I’m not asking you to marry me.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.377
-I’m sorry if I misinterpreted.
-It’s all right.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.280
I get it. Whatever.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.382
[music continues]

04:46.019 --> 04:47.654
Really?

04:49.122 --> 04:51.057
[indistinct chatter]

04:52.792 --> 04:55.027
[sighs]

04:55.128 --> 04:57.130
-Thanks for having us.
-I’ll see you next week, right?

04:57.196 --> 04:58.865
-Absolutely.
-Okay, you be here.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.366
-Thanks for having us.
-Okay, bye.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.535
-Bye-bye.
-Bye. Bye.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.538
-You outta here, hon?
-Yeah.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.074
-Yeah? Okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

05:08.207 --> 05:11.711
Um, so I have a meeting with
the lawyers again next week.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.314
-About the house or what?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:14.414 --> 05:17.417
Uh, the-the medical license,
it’s a whole other story, so...

05:17.550 --> 05:19.585
Listen,
remember what I said, okay?

05:19.652 --> 05:21.854
-One step at a time.
-Mm-hmm.

05:21.921 --> 05:25.625
-Did you hear from Steven today?
-No.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.760
Does that make you sad?

05:27.860 --> 05:31.597
Um, I guess I feel like
I don’t really have the right

05:31.698 --> 05:34.100
to feel that way, you know.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.303
Listen, my third divorce...

05:37.403 --> 05:40.640
it was messier
than my first two put together.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.742
But you’re a good egg, baby.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.945
Don’t let anybody
convince you otherwise.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.814
Thank you for everything.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.316
[inhales]
I’ll see you Thursday.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.485
-Yes, you will. Okay.
-Okay.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.821
-Bye, hon. Bye.
-Bye now.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.291
Are you walking?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.493
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.061
-I can give you a lift.
-Oh, no.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.330
I like the walk,
it helps me clear my head.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.366
-Okay. If you’re sure.
-Yeah.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.134
It’s so close,
it’s just up over the hill

06:08.234 --> 06:09.602
on Franklin, a few blocks.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.804
Oh, well,
there’s a lot of creeps

06:11.904 --> 06:13.706
between here and Franklin.

06:13.806 --> 06:17.877
Yeah, I know. But, um,
I think they’re harmless.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.246
-Not as bad as Steven, right?
-Oh, exactly.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.382
-[chuckles]
-All right, be safe.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.083
-Okay. You, too.
-See you next week.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.152
-Yeah. Bye.
-Bye.

[music continues]

08:13.259 --> 08:14.627
[grunts]

08:17.897 --> 08:20.599
I got you now. [laughs]

08:20.700 --> 08:23.503
-[panting]
-[grunting]

08:26.138 --> 08:29.342
Somebody! Help!
Please! Somebody!

08:29.442 --> 08:31.377
-Come here!
-Okay. Okay, okay.

08:31.477 --> 08:32.978
Help! Somebody.
Okay, okay, okay.

08:33.045 --> 08:34.313
Stop, stop screaming.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.315
Shut your mouth
or I’ll cut you right now.

08:36.382 --> 08:38.184
[grunting]

08:40.119 --> 08:41.554
[grunting]

08:46.826 --> 08:48.094
[knife slashes]

08:54.800 --> 08:56.569
Get outta here!

08:57.637 --> 08:58.971
-Get...
-[grunts]

09:00.973 --> 09:03.142
Go on, get outta here!

09:07.847 --> 09:10.483
Hey, you all right?

09:11.517 --> 09:13.886
-Are you hurt?
-No.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.254
Thanks.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.192
God, your arm is...

09:21.928 --> 09:24.363
Oh, no,
I don’t think it’s deep.

09:24.463 --> 09:27.066
Um, I’m gonna call 911.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.468
[exhales] Wait, wait.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.904
Sorry, could you not?

09:32.004 --> 09:34.574
-Why?
-Well, unless you’re hurt.

09:34.707 --> 09:38.444
I think I’m okay. I just don’t
want to involve the police.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.146
I just... I just started
this new job.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.982
And I-I don’t have insurance
right now.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.753
Uh, to tell you the truth, I...

09:47.820 --> 09:50.323
I’ve got a record. It’s just,
you know, a drug charge.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.993
But... I mean, you know
how cops can be. Right?

09:54.093 --> 09:57.630
Sometimes, people see you
for who you used to be.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.565
You know.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.068
I’m Daniel,
by the way.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.638
Oh, um... [chuckles]
I’m Karen.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.541
Uh, thank you for your help.

10:10.242 --> 10:13.713
-Let me see your arm.
-No, it’s okay. Really.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.181
Let me see.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.515
[instrumental music]

10:16.616 --> 10:18.517
[chuckles] Let me see.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.320
Oh. [clears throat]

10:21.387 --> 10:23.222
Uh, it might need
a few stitches.

10:23.322 --> 10:26.859
Um, when’s the last time
you had a tetanus shot?

10:26.959 --> 10:30.029
Uh, sometime last year, I think.
But I’ll figure it out.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.731
Really. Thank you.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.599
-Uh, you can make it home okay?
-Yeah.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.202
Uh, I’m, I’m-I’m just
up the street.

10:36.335 --> 10:37.937
But I-I could take you
to the hospital.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.039
-I’d be happy to.
-I’m good.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.242
-But your arm is so bad.
-No buts! Okay? [chuckles]

10:43.342 --> 10:45.077
You don’t owe me anything.
All right?

10:45.211 --> 10:47.980
I was just at the right place
at the right time. That’s all.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.482
If you say so.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.287
Well, good night then.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.789
Good night.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.059
[crickets chirping]

11:03.863 --> 11:05.831
[groaning]

11:09.769 --> 11:12.004
Daniel, wait.
[clears throat]

11:14.073 --> 11:17.376
I’m, I’m an ER doctor.
Or I used to be.

11:17.476 --> 11:20.046
-But I-I need to--
-You used to be?

11:20.146 --> 11:22.515
[chuckles]
It’s a long story. Yes.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.884
But I’m not gonna let you
just walk home like this

11:24.984 --> 11:26.151
after what you
did for me tonight.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.787
But I told you,
you don’t owe me--

11:27.853 --> 11:29.789
No buts. Okay?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.490
Now you need to let me
take a closer look

11:31.590 --> 11:33.426
at the cut in the light.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.830
-Okay.
-[chuckles]

11:37.930 --> 11:40.933
Um, it’s this way.

11:43.602 --> 11:44.937
This way.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.473
It’s just up
and around the corner.

11:47.573 --> 11:49.809
-So, it’s not far.
-All right.

11:51.343 --> 11:53.379
-Nice night, huh?
-Well, it’s lovely.

11:53.512 --> 11:54.880
[both chuckling]

11:59.351 --> 12:01.353
[instrumental music]

12:05.558 --> 12:07.560
[leaves rustling]

12:10.696 --> 12:13.332
[Daniel] This is quite a place.
[Karen] Thanks.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.435
[Karen] But I don’t really plan
on sticking around much longer.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.906
Listen, I, I don’t wanna impose.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.042
Okay, seriously, I’m fine.

12:24.510 --> 12:25.811
I don’t really think
you’re in the position

12:25.878 --> 12:27.646
to judge that right now.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.984
I’ve been through worse.
Trust me.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.820
Okay. Well, I’m gonna do my best
to treat your injuries here.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.323
But you have to promise to
let me take you to the hospital

12:37.423 --> 12:39.458
if I think it’s necessary.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.761
Same hospital
where you were an ER doc?

12:41.827 --> 12:44.797
No. Oh, no.
Definitely not that hospital.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.799
Um...

12:46.899 --> 12:49.502
You know, what you said
just about people judging you

12:49.602 --> 12:55.407
for who you used to be.
I know what that’s like.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.647
Hey, Karen!
I thought I heard you.

13:01.714 --> 13:05.217
Sorry. I just wanted
to check with you and...

13:05.317 --> 13:08.387
I’m so sorry. I did not see
that you had company.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.890
Hey, Rhonnie. Yeah, no,
we’re just, um--

13:10.990 --> 13:13.826
Oh, my God! What happened?

13:13.893 --> 13:16.128
Um, I was actually attacked
this evening.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.631
Attacked? By who?

13:18.697 --> 13:20.699
It looked like
a homeless person.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.702
But then this Good Samaritan
jumped in and-and helped me out,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.604
and was cut in the process.

13:25.671 --> 13:28.073
Hmm, well,

13:28.174 --> 13:31.143
don’t let me stop you from
administering a little first aid

13:31.243 --> 13:33.579
to your handsome hero, huh?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.747
[clears throat]
I’ll see you tomorrow.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.783
Sure thing.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.419
Now that’s how you do a rebound.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.454
[chuckling]

13:45.024 --> 13:46.959
[instrumental music]

13:50.229 --> 13:53.899
[Karen] Sorry about that.
[Daniel] Oh, it’s fine.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.214
[door closes]

14:08.314 --> 14:11.016
You live in this big place
all alone?

14:11.116 --> 14:13.786
I shared it with my husband.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.956
Ex-husband.

14:18.624 --> 14:22.294
-Well, it’s tasteful.
-[chuckles] Thanks.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.605
Wow. [chuckles]

14:32.705 --> 14:35.507
-It’s nice.
-Thank you.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.077
Uh, could I please
wash my hands?

14:38.143 --> 14:40.613
Oh, yes, of course.
Um, bathroom.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.115
-Just right around here.
-Great. Thanks.

14:46.852 --> 14:49.922
There’s, um, antibacterial soap
under the sink

14:50.022 --> 14:51.657
if you wanna just make sure
you washed that cut out

14:51.724 --> 14:53.425
really well. Please.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.661
-[Daniel] Yes, doctor.
-[chuckles]

14:55.728 --> 14:58.030
I’m sorry.
It’s kind of a mess in there.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.966
[Daniel] Oh, you should see
my place.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.869
Just wasn’t really
expecting company.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.376
Oh! God! [chuckles]

15:10.476 --> 15:11.844
-You okay?
-Yeah.

15:11.944 --> 15:14.513
I guess I’m just
still a little jumpy.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.415
It’s understandable.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.352
Let me see your cut.

15:20.452 --> 15:23.022
Oh, it’s not as bad
as I thought it was.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.791
-You’re lucky.
-Yeah, I sure am.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.927
[dramatic music]

15:31.163 --> 15:32.765
I think a couple of these

15:32.865 --> 15:35.200
butterfly bandages
will just do it.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.238
Would you step
into my operating room?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.478
Okay.

15:55.054 --> 15:58.557
[Karen] So, where do you live,
Daniel?

15:58.657 --> 16:00.993
[Daniel] Close by. Yeah.
[Karen] Mm?

16:01.060 --> 16:03.295
Over on Fountain and La Brea.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.966
I was actually on my way home
when I saw you.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.802
And how long have you
been in the neighborhood?

16:09.902 --> 16:12.438
Uh, not long.
Just over a year.

16:12.504 --> 16:15.441
Yeah, I-I moved here
to work for my uncle.

16:15.507 --> 16:19.278
-Doing what?
-Commercial real estate.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.579
Yeah, I was actually scoping out

16:20.646 --> 16:22.781
a couple of properties
in the area.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.483
I was, uh,
supposed to do it earlier,

16:24.583 --> 16:26.051
but, uh...

16:27.286 --> 16:30.356
-Ah. It’s all good.
-Oh, sorry.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.058
I guess I’m not that tough
after all.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.560
You’re fine.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.397
Gonna wash my hands.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.399
[music continues]

16:40.499 --> 16:42.501
[water running]

16:50.042 --> 16:51.844
[Karen] So, uh, where were you
living before?

16:51.944 --> 16:56.448
Colorado. Uh, Boulder,
to be exact.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.485
[Karen] Mm, nice. And what were
you doing there, real estate?

17:00.552 --> 17:04.456
I was a rock climbing instructor
and, uh, mountain guide.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.925
That sounds pretty adventurous.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.795
Yeah, it was. Just didn’t
quite pay the bills.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.997
-Mm-hmm.
-You know.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.099
My best friend, Izzie,
goes rock-climbing

17:14.166 --> 17:16.235
with her kids and her husband.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.771
Members at one of those
rock gyms.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.808
And you used to be an ER doc.

17:22.908 --> 17:25.611
I’m on a leave of absence.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.346
But it’s not a voluntary one.

17:28.447 --> 17:31.016
Well, I would love to hear
that long story.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.818
[chuckling]

17:32.885 --> 17:34.353
It’s not really a crowd pleaser.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.256
It’s kind of sad
and pathetic, actually.

17:38.757 --> 17:39.892
I’ve got a feeling
there’s nothing sad

17:40.025 --> 17:41.860
and pathetic about you.

17:45.697 --> 17:48.700
It’s probably gonna
leave a scar.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.037
Yeah, and my own long story
to go along with it.

17:52.137 --> 17:55.340
[Karen chuckles]
It is certainly a doozy.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.476
I’m anxious to see
how it ends.

18:03.015 --> 18:06.752
[exhales] Did you want
some water?

18:07.820 --> 18:10.189
Sure. Yeah, I’m parched.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.594
Shock and acute anxiety
will do that for you.

18:15.694 --> 18:17.029
Oh.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.401
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.071
So, is this the first time

18:26.138 --> 18:28.306
you’ve-you’ve rescued
a damsel in distress?

18:28.407 --> 18:33.045
Or are you out conquering
arch enemies in the night?

18:33.112 --> 18:35.380
-You are teasing me.
-No.

18:35.481 --> 18:36.882
No, you actually really
seemed like you knew

18:36.982 --> 18:38.750
what you were doing.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.253
I had no idea what I was doing.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.555
I’ve never actually been
in a real fight before.

18:43.655 --> 18:46.625
-Hmm.
-But I am an Aries.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.528
And that has something to do
with the warrior spirit.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.029
From what little I know
about the zodiac.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.665
Mm-hmm, I’m an Aries.
When’s your birthday?

18:53.765 --> 18:56.435
-March 30th.
-No!

18:56.502 --> 18:58.170
-What?
-That’s my birthday!

18:58.270 --> 18:59.838
-Seriously?
-Yes!

18:59.938 --> 19:02.441
-No.
-Yeah.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.943
-Okay, that is too weird.
-It’s really weird.

19:05.043 --> 19:07.713
-It’s very weird.
-Huh.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.621
Well, I would say
that we are even now,

19:15.721 --> 19:18.123
fellow warrior.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.058
-I’d better run.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.894
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.029
[instrumental music]

19:36.108 --> 19:37.409
[sighs]

19:47.719 --> 19:50.355
-Ooh!
-Whoa.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.491
It’s all right.
Dizzy spell.

19:52.624 --> 19:54.893
Um, you don’t really look like
you should be running anywhere.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.628
-W-why don’t you sit back down?
-Yeah.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.664
Maybe I took one to the head
a little harder than I thought.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.399
[Karen chuckles]

20:00.465 --> 20:02.467
Hold still.
Why don’t you look at me?

20:03.936 --> 20:05.737
Um...

20:05.804 --> 20:07.806
Yeah, you might have
a mild concussion.

20:07.906 --> 20:11.176
I, I think you should stick
around so we can monitor you.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.245
And if your symptoms get worse,
you’re going to the hospital

20:13.312 --> 20:16.381
whether you want to or not.

20:16.515 --> 20:20.519
-Well, if you insist.
-I would feel better about it.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.990
-Okay.
-Here, let me take this.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.025
-I’m sorry.
-You’re fine.

20:33.265 --> 20:36.034
-You good? Okay.
-Yeah.

20:36.134 --> 20:39.538
[Karen chuckles] Why don’t you
just sit right here?

20:39.638 --> 20:41.974
-Here we go. Mm-hm.
-Thank you.

20:44.176 --> 20:47.112
Um, I’m gonna go and I’m gonna
get you that shirt.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.081
Okay. Thanks.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.420
[dramatic music]

21:22.147 --> 21:25.417
-Here you go. Mm-hm.
-Thank you.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.821
Um, will you be okay
if I just take a few minutes

21:29.888 --> 21:31.823
and go get cleaned up?

21:32.958 --> 21:35.360
-Sure thing. Yeah.
-Okay.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.496
[music continues]

21:59.885 --> 22:01.219
[sighing]

22:03.455 --> 22:05.524
[cell phone vibrating]

22:12.931 --> 22:17.235
-Hey, Izzie.
-Bye, you guys. Have fun!

22:17.336 --> 22:18.904
Hey, Karen.
Where have you been?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.372
<i>I’ve been calling you
</i>    <i> for an hour.</i>

22:20.439 --> 22:23.809
Ugh, gosh, sorry.
Um, look, I’m okay.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.844
But I just wanna let you know
I was on my way home

22:25.911 --> 22:29.647
from my meeting and there was a
guy jumped out and attacked me.

22:29.715 --> 22:33.685
A-attacked?
As in physically attacked you?

22:33.785 --> 22:35.821
Yes. But like I said, I’m fine.

22:35.954 --> 22:38.256
There was this other gentleman,
this Good Samaritan

22:38.323 --> 22:42.127
who kinda came out of nowhere
and-and helped me out, so...

22:42.227 --> 22:43.662
I’ve told you a hundred times

22:43.795 --> 22:45.764
not to walk home
from the community center.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.632
<i> I mean, if-if you
don’t wanna drive, call me</i>

22:47.733 --> 22:50.001
<i>or take a Rideshare.</i>

22:50.135 --> 22:51.503
You know, I’ve actually
had my fair share

22:51.636 --> 22:53.305
of freaky Rideshares, too.

22:53.405 --> 22:56.141
You’re just a magnet
for trouble, aren’t you?

22:56.241 --> 23:00.112
Well, what about this other guy?
The-the guy who helped you?

23:00.212 --> 23:04.449
Um... Just hang on.

23:08.019 --> 23:12.591
He is fine, um, seems like
he’s got a few minor cuts

23:12.691 --> 23:15.360
and contusions, but he’s okay.
He’s in the other room.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.696
What... He’s-he’s there?

23:17.763 --> 23:20.399
He’s there with you now
in your house?

23:20.532 --> 23:22.801
Yeah, Izzie, he is,
because he just saved me

23:22.868 --> 23:24.903
from being robbed
or who knows what.

23:25.003 --> 23:26.571
And I’m not gonna just send him
out into the world

23:26.705 --> 23:27.906
concussed and bleeding.

23:28.006 --> 23:30.675
Karen, judgement. I mean...

23:30.776 --> 23:32.043
[Karen]<i> You know,
I-I really think</i>

23:32.144 --> 23:34.513
<i> you can give me
some credit here.</i>

23:34.613 --> 23:36.748
-Is Rhonnie there?
-Yeah.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.183
I actually ran into her
on my way inside.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.018
[Izzie]<i> Okay, good.
</i>  <i> Call her now.</i>

23:40.118 --> 23:41.953
<i>Have her come back, so you’re
</i>  <i> not alone with this guy.</i>

23:42.087 --> 23:44.523
-I’m not gonna bug Rhonnie.
-Then I’m coming over.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.158
Izzie, what’s the matter
with you, why are you

23:46.258 --> 23:47.826
freaking out about this?
It’s not that big of a--

23:47.926 --> 23:50.462
I’m not freaking out, okay?
Just-just sit tight.

23:50.562 --> 23:52.664
Jerry and the girls,
they just left for the airport.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.433
<i> They’re getting right out
of New York, I can be there</i>

23:54.499 --> 23:56.535
in less than 30 minutes.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.403
No, Izzie, Izzie...

23:58.470 --> 24:00.539

Oh, hello there.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.832
Hello.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.667
How’s the patient?

27:15.767 --> 27:17.669
I’m fine. Thank you.

27:19.437 --> 27:22.574
-Where’s Karen?
-Uh, she’s getting cleaned up.

27:22.674 --> 27:24.609
Oh, gotcha.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.044
Karen’s friend buzzed me,
asked me

27:26.144 --> 27:29.381
to come by and check on her,
so...

27:29.447 --> 27:31.883
She’s getting cleaned up,
as I said.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.752
Well, I, I really appreciate you

27:34.819 --> 27:37.122
being a hero to my friend
like that.

27:37.222 --> 27:40.225
She’s been through enough
this year.

27:40.291 --> 27:43.361
Yes, I’ve-I’ve gathered.

27:43.428 --> 27:47.899
-So are you gonna invite me in?
-Uh, I can’t really do that.

27:47.999 --> 27:51.503
Can I?
It’s not my house.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.408
Okay.

28:00.612 --> 28:02.614
[crickets chirping]

28:13.458 --> 28:15.460
[dramatic music]

28:22.901 --> 28:26.170
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.172
Who was at the door?

28:28.273 --> 28:31.576
Oh, just some religious nut.
Yeah.

28:31.676 --> 28:33.978
I hope you don’t mind
that I answered it.

28:34.079 --> 28:37.816
Really?
Seems kinda late.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.885
Yeah, they get more persistent
all the time.

28:40.952 --> 28:43.521
Convince we’re all lost souls
that need saving.

28:43.588 --> 28:46.558
Hm, lost souls, huh.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.628
So, what’s going on
with the butterfly?

28:52.397 --> 28:55.233
Oh, it doesn’t seem to be
sticking.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.802
Why don’t you let me
take a look at it?

28:57.869 --> 29:00.905
-Let’s go in here. I’ll fix it.
-Okay. Sure.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.974
[dramatic music]

29:18.022 --> 29:19.491
-Same phone.
-Hm?

29:19.591 --> 29:23.228
It looks like we’ve got
the same phone, too.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.697
Ah! [chuckles]

29:25.764 --> 29:27.432
Twins.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.602
You know, this is so strange.

29:30.702 --> 29:33.538
This brand is usually
really good.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.040
The adhesive must be faulty.

29:38.176 --> 29:43.548
So, uh, that is quite a scar
on your stomach.

29:43.648 --> 29:45.483
[chuckles] Yeah.

29:45.550 --> 29:49.220
I really did a number on it
in a bar fight.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.723
In a bar fight?

29:51.823 --> 29:52.891
[Daniel chuckles]

29:52.991 --> 29:54.358
I don’t know, you just said

29:54.459 --> 29:57.962
that you had never been
in a real fight before.

29:58.029 --> 30:00.632
Oh, yeah, uh...

30:00.698 --> 30:02.033
That wasn’t a real fight.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.701
Uh, it happened
when I was bartending.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.036
Hm.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.005
You know, some guys
started fighting.

30:07.105 --> 30:08.706
And you know,
I had to break it up

30:08.807 --> 30:10.575
before they destroyed the place.

30:10.675 --> 30:13.244
Uh, well, unfortunately,

30:13.344 --> 30:17.215
one of them, uh, stabbed me
in the process accidentally.

30:17.282 --> 30:19.584
[music continues]

30:19.717 --> 30:22.787
-Accidentally?
-Yeah, uh...

30:22.887 --> 30:25.890
I got right in the middle
when one of them pulled a knife.

30:25.957 --> 30:29.460
-So... Yeah.
-Hm.

30:31.296 --> 30:34.165
Well, your surgeon certainly
stitched you up nicely.

30:36.167 --> 30:39.003
And that kinda sounds
like a real fight to me.

30:40.738 --> 30:45.176
I wouldn’t count breaking up
a fight as being in a fight.

30:45.243 --> 30:47.245
It’s still pretty intense.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.788
[Daniel] At moments like these,
I could really use a drink.

31:00.792 --> 31:04.662
Uh... yeah. I...

31:04.762 --> 31:07.999
-I would offer. But I just--
-Oh, no, it’s okay.

31:08.099 --> 31:10.602
I’m sober now, too.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.169
Two years now.

31:12.270 --> 31:15.406
-Yeah. Going strong.
-Hm.

31:15.473 --> 31:19.343
-Today is my nine months.
-Congrats.

31:19.444 --> 31:23.381
-Uh, that’s, that’s amazing.
-Thanks.

31:23.514 --> 31:27.018
Yeah, I was in a pretty dark
place there for a while.

31:27.085 --> 31:30.021
Just... did a lot of things
I regret.

31:30.088 --> 31:34.058
And... alienated
a lot of people.

31:34.192 --> 31:37.228
But I’m moving forward

31:37.328 --> 31:39.731
and focusing on just my health

31:39.864 --> 31:44.035
and my career
and relationships.

31:45.870 --> 31:47.238
Husband?

31:48.539 --> 31:50.741
How did you...

31:50.842 --> 31:53.945
Uh, you-you mentioned
your ex-husband earlier.

31:54.012 --> 31:57.682
-Just... Yeah. [chuckles]
-Oh, that’s right. Yeah.

31:57.782 --> 32:02.720
Yeah, that ship has sailed,
but that’s okay.

32:02.787 --> 32:07.425
Yeah, I’m just all on my own now
and I’ve accepted it.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.261
Well, that is powerful.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.463
Strong.

32:14.866 --> 32:17.735
I think if I was strong
I wouldn’t be in this position.

32:17.835 --> 32:19.837
That is not true.

32:21.739 --> 32:25.810
Besides, in our moments
of weakness...

32:25.877 --> 32:29.013
we have to lean on each other.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.883
And I’m grateful for the chance

32:31.950 --> 32:34.986
to have been there for you
tonight.

32:36.654 --> 32:38.489
[dramatic music]

32:39.490 --> 32:41.159
[cell phone vibrating]

32:45.930 --> 32:48.066
Excuse me a moment.

32:51.002 --> 32:52.837
[Karen clears throat]

32:59.344 --> 33:01.746
[Karen] Hello.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.216
[Jimmy on phone]
<i>Hey. It’s me, Jimmy.</i>

33:06.718 --> 33:09.988
[sighs] Hey, Jimmy.
What’s up? It’s late.

33:10.088 --> 33:12.623
[Jimmy]<i> Uh, I know, uh,
</i>   <i> I’m sorry, uh...</i>

33:13.858 --> 33:16.260
I was just, uh,
thinking about you

33:16.394 --> 33:18.929
and I, I thought I would,

33:19.030 --> 33:20.598
<i>I would call, you know.</i>

33:20.732 --> 33:25.936
-Jimmy, where are you?
-[Jimmy]<i> Uh, no place...</i>

33:26.037 --> 33:27.505
<i>No place special.</i>

33:27.572 --> 33:30.675
I was just thinking that...

33:30.742 --> 33:32.343
I wanted to apologize for,

33:32.410 --> 33:34.012
you know, what happened
after the meeting.

33:34.078 --> 33:36.647
And-and that wasn’t right.

33:36.781 --> 33:39.316
And, you know...

33:39.384 --> 33:41.986
I had no right to act like that.

33:42.053 --> 33:44.655
<i> You’re such
an inspiring person, Karen.</i>

33:44.756 --> 33:46.758
<i>I’m just garbage.</i>

33:46.824 --> 33:51.162
[sighs] You’re-you’re
not garbage, Jimmy.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.497
<i>Have you called your sponsor?</i>

33:53.598 --> 33:54.832
Ted?

33:54.932 --> 33:57.435
Oh, man, Ted’s a hypocrite.

33:57.502 --> 34:00.004
<i>Besides, you’re, you’re,</i>

34:00.104 --> 34:02.807
<i>you’re much more helpful
</i>     <i> than he is.</i>

34:02.907 --> 34:05.143
Oh, Jimmy, wherever you are,

34:05.243 --> 34:07.545
you need to get a ride home.

34:07.678 --> 34:11.048
Sounds like
you actually care about me.

34:11.115 --> 34:14.185
Do you, do you care about me?

34:15.453 --> 34:18.523
Yeah... Yeah, of course.
Of course, I do.

34:18.589 --> 34:24.228
I mean... would you care
if something bad happened to me?

34:24.328 --> 34:28.566
Ye... Yeah. W-what do you mean
something bad?

34:28.699 --> 34:32.403
[Jimmy]<i> Care, pity.
Same difference, right?</i>

34:32.537 --> 34:34.772
Uh, come on, Jimmy.

34:36.207 --> 34:38.943
Look, I-I gotta go, Karen.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.445
Okay, promise me
that wherever you are

34:40.545 --> 34:42.213
you’re gonna get a ride home.

34:43.347 --> 34:46.784
Yeah, I’m sorry for bugging you.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.455
<i> -Bye, Karen.
</i>-Jimmy. Jim...

34:53.391 --> 34:55.326
[dramatic music]

34:58.062 --> 34:59.263
[sighs]

35:04.602 --> 35:06.037
[sighs]

35:10.074 --> 35:11.909
-Oh, God!
-Whoa.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.679
It’s just me.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.247
-[sighs]
-Is everything okay?

35:16.347 --> 35:18.082
Yeah.

35:18.182 --> 35:21.018
Yeah, I don’t,
um, maybe I don’t know, but I...

35:21.152 --> 35:22.386
Yeah, I couldn’t help
over hearing.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.789
It sounded like a tough
conversation.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.392
He’s a friend of yours?

35:28.493 --> 35:32.196
Yeah, just a friend
reaching out for help.

35:32.296 --> 35:35.600
Well, it seems like we’re both
destined to be saviors tonight.

35:37.001 --> 35:39.937
Just don’t think,
I was very effective.

35:40.004 --> 35:42.907
There you go, not giving
yourself enough credit.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.045
Hey, you shouldn’t do that.

35:48.112 --> 35:51.315
I bet you’ve helped
a lot of people, haven’t you?

35:53.217 --> 35:55.453
I’ve tried.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.588
I think you’ve done
more than that.

35:59.590 --> 36:02.927
I just hope the people
that you’ve helped...

36:03.027 --> 36:06.430
understand and appreciate
just how important that you are.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.434
And I know I would.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.172
What are you doing?

36:14.238 --> 36:15.706
Come here.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.844
[mellow music]

36:19.944 --> 36:21.345
What’s wrong?

36:23.114 --> 36:26.017
I just think this is a bit...

36:26.117 --> 36:29.086
-[engine revving]
-[tires screeching]

36:29.153 --> 36:31.322
[car horn blaring]

36:31.455 --> 36:32.990
Popular lady.

36:33.124 --> 36:35.126
Oh! I almost forgot about Izzie.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.161
Izzie?

36:37.295 --> 36:39.663
It’s just, she’s my friend.

36:39.764 --> 36:40.831
Excuse me.

36:41.999 --> 36:45.036
[music continues]

36:48.105 --> 36:49.673
[door creaking]

36:49.774 --> 36:52.877
What happened
with the sick rapist freak?

36:53.010 --> 36:55.646
-Uh, God.
-[Izzie] Come here.

36:55.746 --> 36:57.949
He, he took off.

36:58.049 --> 37:02.053
Um, Izzie, this is Daniel.
Daniel, Izzie.

37:02.186 --> 37:04.655
You didn’t even call the cops?

37:04.722 --> 37:07.725
Well, I think we were both
in shock. Yeah.

37:07.858 --> 37:11.395
-I was injured, so...
-Yeah, I can see that.

37:11.529 --> 37:15.233
Yeah, by the time we came
to our senses, he was long gone.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.568
Yeah, you know, you really
didn’t have to come over here.

37:17.702 --> 37:20.104
-There’s no reason to worry.
-Oh, it’s no big deal.

37:20.204 --> 37:22.640
Jerry took the girls
out of town this weekend,

37:22.707 --> 37:25.576
and the house is a little
too quiet for my taste.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.945
And if there’s anything
you’ve given me over the years,

37:28.079 --> 37:30.414
it is reason to worry.

37:30.514 --> 37:33.317
And as smart
as my best friend is,

37:33.417 --> 37:36.654
she hasn’t always shown the
best judgment. [clears throat]

37:36.754 --> 37:38.990
Maybe you should
give her a break.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.125
You know,
she’s been through a lot.

37:41.225 --> 37:44.028
Yeah, could’ve been a lot worse,
apparently,

37:44.095 --> 37:45.963
if it weren’t for you.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.698
Could have been.

37:49.600 --> 37:53.771
So, Daniel,
what is it that you do?

37:55.239 --> 37:58.075
I am in commercial real estate.

37:58.175 --> 38:00.711
Yeah, you know, fortunately for
me, Daniel was here in the area

38:00.778 --> 38:03.047
checking out
some local listings late.

38:03.147 --> 38:05.383
Very late, apparently.

38:06.817 --> 38:09.020
And he was also
a rock-climbing instructor,

38:09.153 --> 38:11.022
and I told him how you
and Jerry and the kids...

38:11.155 --> 38:12.690
-You’re really into that.
-Hmm.

38:12.790 --> 38:16.360
Did you work at a local gym
or...

38:16.460 --> 38:18.195
I was actually guiding in Utah.

38:19.397 --> 38:20.931
I thought it was Colorado.

38:22.333 --> 38:26.304
It was. Um, before,
I was in Utah, Moab.

38:26.370 --> 38:27.938
I was bouncing back
and forth a bit.

38:28.005 --> 38:31.108
We actually took
a family vacation in Moab.

38:31.175 --> 38:33.243
It’s a beautiful place.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.680
What were some of your
favorite spots?

38:36.514 --> 38:37.815
I-I don’t know, really.

38:37.915 --> 38:40.117
God, there are so many.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.920
Come on, you have to have one.
I mean...

38:43.054 --> 38:45.856
If you worked there
and everything.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.427
Owl Rock, maybe.

38:50.428 --> 38:52.263
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

38:52.396 --> 38:53.764
Yeah, we went there.

38:56.233 --> 38:58.002
-[cell phone buzzes]
-Oh!

38:58.069 --> 39:00.304
-[Izzie] Who’s that?
-Oh, God, it’s...

39:00.404 --> 39:02.340
[Karen] I gotta take this,
I’m sorry.

39:02.406 --> 39:05.042
But, um, you guys talk

39:05.142 --> 39:06.811
and just be good, please.

39:06.911 --> 39:08.679
-[Daniel] Okay.
-[laughs]

39:13.384 --> 39:17.388
So, Daniel... just you and me,
huh?

39:18.456 --> 39:20.024
Just me and you.

39:22.426 --> 39:24.462
[sighs] Hey, Jimmy.
Where are you?

39:24.528 --> 39:26.597
Can you please tell me
you’re not driving right now?

39:26.664 --> 39:28.299
[Jimmy on phone]<i> I’m not.</i>

39:28.366 --> 39:31.635
I was, but... I’m not now.

39:33.637 --> 39:37.208
I’m so sick of myself.

39:38.142 --> 39:40.478
<i>I, I can’t...</i>

39:40.578 --> 39:42.513
<i>I can’t keep doing this.</i>

39:42.613 --> 39:45.282
You can’t keep doing what,
Jimmy?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.251
I just want it to stop.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.053
I just want it to stop.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.555
[Karen on phone]<i> You can stop.
</i>   <i> I promise you, you can.</i>

39:51.689 --> 39:53.891
Oh, cut the group crap, Karen.

39:54.024 --> 39:57.228
<i>This, this just has to end.</i>

39:57.361 --> 39:59.563
I want it to end, right now.

40:05.536 --> 40:08.038
Still can’t believe
that coincidence.

40:09.673 --> 40:11.475
-What?
-[Izzie] I mean...

40:11.542 --> 40:13.978
That you just happened to be
right there

40:14.044 --> 40:15.746
when Karen got attacked.

40:15.846 --> 40:17.548
You know, no one else around.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.785
Just... you.

40:21.852 --> 40:25.456
Are you trying to say
that it wasn’t a coincidence?

40:25.589 --> 40:28.392
-[sighs]
-You know, maybe you’re right.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.729
Maybe it was destiny.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.134
So, where are you from, Daniel?

40:37.234 --> 40:39.803
All over the world, really.

40:39.904 --> 40:44.775
California, Germany, Guam,
as a military grad.

40:44.875 --> 40:46.677
And what do you like to do
for fun?

40:46.777 --> 40:50.581
I mean, when you’re not rescuing
damsels in distress.

40:52.149 --> 40:55.186
I don’t really have many
hobbies these days.

40:55.319 --> 40:59.356
I’ve become a very focused
individual, driven.

40:59.490 --> 41:02.059
Hey, what do you do?

41:02.159 --> 41:05.429
I mean, besides babysitting
your little friend.

41:05.496 --> 41:10.200
Well, as smart a Karen is,
she’s always been too trusting.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.938
You know, that’s part of what’s
gotten her in the most trouble.

41:14.004 --> 41:17.475
That and the fact that she
nearly worked herself to death.

41:19.677 --> 41:23.881
Well, let’s say we keep this
about you.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.786
Fair enough.

41:28.886 --> 41:33.423
So, the real estate’s
pretty tough in this area, hm?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.426
-Well, I’ve been doing okay.
-Yeah?

41:35.559 --> 41:39.263
Do you have a website?
I’d love to check it out.

41:39.363 --> 41:42.933
Yeah, uh, it’s down
for maintenance.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.471
So, here’s a coincidence.

41:47.571 --> 41:50.574
I work in real estate, too.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.812
I wasn’t familiar with
any commercial listings

41:54.912 --> 41:56.514
in this area.

41:57.882 --> 41:59.483
Well, I do commercial
in private.

41:59.550 --> 42:03.521
[Izzie] Mm. So, what properties
where you looking at?

42:05.122 --> 42:06.823
Names?

42:06.924 --> 42:09.326
Or addresses,
I might know of them.

42:09.426 --> 42:12.229
Well, I don’t remember
the exact addresses.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.266
Is that your briefcase?

42:17.101 --> 42:20.905
Maybe you could check.

42:20.971 --> 42:24.341
Well, you’re gonna think I’m
a creep no matter what I say.

42:24.441 --> 42:26.410
’Cause you’ve already decided.

42:26.510 --> 42:30.247
Maybe, or maybe you can give me

42:30.347 --> 42:32.883
the name of just one
of your many listings

42:33.017 --> 42:35.419
and that’ll satisfy
the babysitter.

42:35.519 --> 42:38.522
[dramatic music]

42:39.924 --> 42:41.892
[Izzie chuckles]

42:42.026 --> 42:44.762
Yeah, just as I thought.

42:44.862 --> 42:46.730
I told you.

42:46.864 --> 42:48.832
I don’t remember the addresses.

42:51.035 --> 42:54.638
And I told you
I’m a real estate agent.

42:54.705 --> 42:57.274
But then again...

42:57.374 --> 42:58.776
Maybe I’m not.

43:00.945 --> 43:02.613
I find the way
that you’re treating me to be

43:02.713 --> 43:05.349
very... ungrateful.

43:06.450 --> 43:07.651
[Izzie] Do you?

43:09.320 --> 43:11.288
I don’t like people
who are ungrateful.

43:11.388 --> 43:14.391
[music continues]

43:20.431 --> 43:23.767
Okay, Jimmy, look, I-I need you
to tell me where you are.

43:23.867 --> 43:25.736
<i>I’m serious.</i>

43:25.803 --> 43:28.172
It doesn’t matter.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.641
Jimmy, I want to help you,
I want to send someone to you,

43:30.741 --> 43:32.843
but I’ve gotta know
where you’re at.

43:32.943 --> 43:37.548
Look, I, uh, I-I didn’t mean
to upset you. I-I’m sorry.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.517
I’m not. You didn’t upset me,
but I would like to know

43:40.618 --> 43:43.053
that you’re not gonna do
anything crazy right now.

43:43.153 --> 43:44.521
Bye, Karen.

43:45.356 --> 43:48.025
[mellow music]

43:48.158 --> 43:49.793
[sighs]

43:52.496 --> 43:53.664
Tsk.

44:14.284 --> 44:15.519
Hmm.

44:16.420 --> 44:18.455
Where’s Izzie?

44:18.555 --> 44:20.724
Oh, she just left. Yeah.

44:20.791 --> 44:24.194
Uh, she seemed a little, um...
I don’t know, impatient.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.731
Huh.

44:31.435 --> 44:34.471
[music continues]

44:36.974 --> 44:38.375
Her car’s there.

44:40.010 --> 44:42.446
Well, maybe, she went across
the street to visit, uh,

44:42.513 --> 44:44.148
what’s her name, Rhonnie.

44:49.119 --> 44:50.654
She didn’t say anything?

44:51.722 --> 44:54.158
Not really. No.

44:57.127 --> 44:59.963
Yeah, I get the sense that
she doesn’t like me very much,

45:00.030 --> 45:02.165
for some reason.

45:02.266 --> 45:03.934
[cell phone vibrating]

45:13.110 --> 45:15.946
Does she always treat you
that way?

45:16.046 --> 45:17.915
No, she’s just protective.

45:19.283 --> 45:20.918
So am I.

45:24.121 --> 45:27.224
Hey. Where’d you go? Call me.

45:29.226 --> 45:31.095
Oh. Tsk!

45:31.195 --> 45:32.562
What’s going on?
Are you okay?

45:32.663 --> 45:35.398
Yeah. Yeah, I think.

45:35.499 --> 45:37.968
Ah, it’s just another one
of those dizzy spells.

45:39.369 --> 45:42.172
Um, maybe you should sit down.

45:42.272 --> 45:43.406
Honestly, I think we should
think about

45:43.507 --> 45:45.142
taking you to the hospital.

45:45.209 --> 45:46.810
Head injuries just aren’t
something to mess with.

45:46.877 --> 45:49.179
No. No, no, no.
It’s fine.

45:49.279 --> 45:51.048
It’s fine, um...

45:52.883 --> 45:55.285
Could I, could I just use
your bathroom, please?

45:55.352 --> 45:57.955
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay. Thanks.

45:59.423 --> 46:02.125
Oh, hey, um...

46:02.226 --> 46:05.529
Why don’t you use my bathroom?
It’s just down the hall.

46:05.596 --> 46:08.465
It’s just nicer.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.768
-Okay. Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

46:12.102 --> 46:15.072
[dramatic music]

46:25.682 --> 46:28.685
[music continues]

47:09.593 --> 47:12.095
[music continues]

47:32.482 --> 47:34.885
Why are you so sad, Karen?

47:41.592 --> 47:44.595
[intense music]

47:56.740 --> 47:59.543
[dramatic music]

48:26.803 --> 48:29.806
[music continues]

48:38.815 --> 48:41.818
[intense music]

48:43.787 --> 48:46.122
-Hey.
-[gasps]

48:46.189 --> 48:48.258
Looks like we’ve had
a little mix-up.

48:49.426 --> 48:51.862
Twins, remember?

48:53.597 --> 48:56.433
Why is there a picture
of my house on your phone?

48:58.435 --> 49:00.037
Are there?

49:01.405 --> 49:02.706
I don’t know, I’ve taken
a lot of photos

49:02.773 --> 49:04.141
around the neighborhood.

49:04.274 --> 49:05.742
Real estate, remember?

49:08.078 --> 49:10.847
Besides, is it really so crazy

49:10.948 --> 49:13.350
that I might have
a random picture of you?

49:15.786 --> 49:17.788
We’re obviously connected.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.968
[Karen gasps]

49:32.836 --> 49:34.704
You can appreciate that.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.406
Can’t you?

49:38.642 --> 49:40.077
Yeah.

49:41.011 --> 49:43.013
Yeah, I can.

49:43.113 --> 49:45.749
You might not even be alive now
if it wasn’t for me.

49:47.217 --> 49:49.919
[Karen] I know that.

49:49.987 --> 49:51.922
Your best friend says
that you’re trusting.

49:53.256 --> 49:55.459
Can’t you trust
your own savior?

49:56.994 --> 49:59.696
[dramatic music]

49:59.763 --> 50:01.231
Yeah.

50:01.298 --> 50:02.366
Good.

50:04.368 --> 50:05.836
Now, can I have my phone back?

50:23.286 --> 50:25.222
And what about my phone?

50:29.292 --> 50:30.961
[knocking on door]

50:32.929 --> 50:35.732
You’re a popular lady indeed.

50:39.136 --> 50:41.405
-[knocking on door]
-Aren’t you gonna see who it is?

50:44.241 --> 50:47.244
[dramatic music]

51:01.224 --> 51:03.860
-Jimmy!
-Hello.

51:03.960 --> 51:06.263
Now, I-I-I-I know...

51:06.363 --> 51:09.966
I know I shouldn’t be here.
I have no right, but...

51:10.033 --> 51:12.469
I just felt like
I should come over.

51:12.536 --> 51:14.971
I’m really glad you’re here.

51:15.038 --> 51:16.807
-Oh, you are?
-You know...

51:16.873 --> 51:19.376
I just was really worried
about you.

51:21.011 --> 51:22.079
Oh...

51:23.747 --> 51:26.683
You-you-you have,
you have company.

51:27.951 --> 51:29.986
What can we do to help you,
Jimmy?

51:31.922 --> 51:33.356
I was, um...

51:36.460 --> 51:39.596
I was having a bad night
and I, um...

51:41.164 --> 51:44.267
I was hoping to talk to Karen,
is all.

51:44.367 --> 51:47.270
Well, you’ve already talked
to her tonight, haven’t you?

51:49.206 --> 51:50.373
Yeah.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.975
Well, it’s a little
disrespectful

51:52.075 --> 51:54.578
to just show up like this,
isn’t it, Jimmy?

51:56.213 --> 51:58.982
-I’m sorry.
-[Daniel] Yeah.

51:59.049 --> 52:02.953
[chuckles] Hey, y’all having
a party or what?

52:03.019 --> 52:06.156
Nobody invited me.
[chuckles]

52:06.223 --> 52:08.792
Oh, it’s not a party.

52:08.859 --> 52:10.360
Well, it looks like Izzie
made it by.

52:10.460 --> 52:12.829
Her car’s in the driveway.

52:12.929 --> 52:15.932
[dramatic music]

52:23.273 --> 52:27.811
Okay, well... have her stop by
before she leaves.

52:27.911 --> 52:29.513
I’ll be up.

52:31.615 --> 52:33.450
Everything okay, Karen?

52:35.318 --> 52:37.053
Yeah.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.722
Yeah, I’m fine.

52:44.227 --> 52:45.395
Okay.

52:48.298 --> 52:49.399
Okay.

52:51.835 --> 52:54.371
Can I use your bathroom?

52:54.437 --> 52:55.839
You take care now, Jimmy.

52:55.906 --> 52:58.508
[music continues]

52:58.575 --> 53:00.577
[Jimmy] Okay, okay.

53:02.946 --> 53:05.115
[groaning]

53:05.182 --> 53:07.684
[Jimmy retching]

53:08.985 --> 53:12.289
I’m thinking,
I shouldn’t be driving.

53:12.355 --> 53:13.924
[sniffles]

53:13.990 --> 53:15.792
[Daniel] Well, you made it
over here, didn’t you?

53:20.063 --> 53:21.464
Yeah.

53:22.299 --> 53:25.302
Okay. I’m...

53:26.336 --> 53:27.971
I’m sorry.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.740
Just...

53:32.142 --> 53:33.410
Jimmy!

53:35.478 --> 53:36.646
Huh?

53:36.746 --> 53:38.081
You know, I...

53:38.181 --> 53:41.685
I just want you to remember
what Anne said,

53:41.751 --> 53:44.354
you know, at the meeting,
’cause, uh...

53:45.855 --> 53:48.091
It’s okay to realize
you have a problem.

53:48.191 --> 53:53.530
But, um... you, I need you
to please...

53:53.597 --> 53:55.699
please get help.

53:57.701 --> 53:58.802
Please?

54:02.505 --> 54:03.873
Okay.

54:06.476 --> 54:07.877
I’m sorry.

54:08.979 --> 54:12.015
[crickets chirping]

54:14.951 --> 54:17.220
No, please, please.
Please!

54:17.287 --> 54:18.421
[door locks]

54:18.488 --> 54:21.491
[mellow music]

54:32.302 --> 54:34.237
Where’s Izzie?

54:34.304 --> 54:36.472
I told you, I don’t know.

54:36.573 --> 54:38.942
That’s a lie.

54:39.042 --> 54:41.711
There you go with
that distrust again.

54:43.613 --> 54:45.615
Could I have my phone back,
please?

54:49.152 --> 54:50.754
[sighs]

54:54.891 --> 54:56.559
Okay, fine.

54:58.028 --> 55:00.563
Maybe you’re right.

55:00.664 --> 55:04.934
Maybe I haven’t been honest
with you, Karen.

55:08.638 --> 55:11.675
Maybe I do know more about you
than I first let on.

55:15.745 --> 55:18.348
I know first hand
that you can’t help everybody

55:18.448 --> 55:20.116
in this messed up world.

55:22.152 --> 55:25.555
That the strong
have to choose carefully.

55:27.290 --> 55:30.060
I choose people
who truly deserve it.

55:32.395 --> 55:35.031
Did you choose me... Daniel?

55:35.098 --> 55:37.567
No. No.

55:39.169 --> 55:41.204
It was destiny, Karen.

55:44.074 --> 55:45.742
Do you believe in destiny?

55:47.977 --> 55:49.646
[shuddering]

55:49.746 --> 55:52.782
[dramatic music]

55:58.521 --> 56:02.792
One night,
when I was in college...

56:02.859 --> 56:04.828
I was out with my some friends,

56:04.961 --> 56:08.598
and, uh, I was drinking
a little too much.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.235
[sighs]
Really, the next morning,

56:12.302 --> 56:15.038
I got my car and I headed home.

56:15.138 --> 56:17.807
<i>I was definitely too drunk
</i>       <i> to drive.</i>

56:19.743 --> 56:22.078
<i>Now the more that you drink,</i>

56:22.178 --> 56:25.248
<i> the worse you are
at making decisions.</i>

56:25.348 --> 56:28.551
<i>And you can make some
really poor decisions</i>

56:28.618 --> 56:31.388
<i> when you’re under
the influence, right?</i>

56:31.521 --> 56:33.923
<i>I mean, you know, Karen.</i>

56:34.023 --> 56:36.693
<i> Once that alcohol
hits your bloodstream,</i>

56:36.760 --> 56:39.496
goes straight to your head,
you can’t think.

56:40.563 --> 56:42.365
So, was it my fault?

56:44.634 --> 56:45.835
<i>It wasn’t my fault
that I was driving</i>

56:45.902 --> 56:48.738
<i>on the wrong side of the road.</i>

56:48.838 --> 56:51.307
<i>My car flipped over
and all I know...</i>

56:52.776 --> 56:55.445
<i> I didn’t know
when it was gonna stop.</i>

56:55.512 --> 56:57.347
<i>It felt like forever.</i>

56:59.449 --> 57:01.317
<i>And then, finally, it did.</i>

57:03.019 --> 57:04.654
<i>And I was alive.</i>

57:06.589 --> 57:08.425
You know, that was a miracle.

57:10.627 --> 57:12.729
You know, unfortunately,
the mother and daughter

57:12.796 --> 57:15.765
that were in the other car,
they...

57:15.865 --> 57:18.268
Well, they didn’t have
the same destiny as me.

57:20.136 --> 57:21.604
It’s funny, isn’t it?

57:23.106 --> 57:26.676
I was the drunk one,
yet I lived and they...

57:26.776 --> 57:29.546
were driving cross country
to visit a sick friend.

57:30.713 --> 57:34.150
-And they died.
-Mm.

57:34.217 --> 57:37.754
You should’ve thought about the
consequences before you drank.

57:37.854 --> 57:40.123
You’re blaming the alcohol,
but you murdered those people.

57:40.190 --> 57:43.126
First of all, I am not
a murderer, okay?

57:43.193 --> 57:45.829
In the eyes of the law,
it’s manslaughter, not murder.

57:47.664 --> 57:50.500
And I served my time.

57:50.567 --> 57:53.803
-What, like a month or two?
-Actually, it was six months.

57:53.870 --> 57:57.407
-It’s ridiculous.
-I was in college, Karen.

57:57.507 --> 57:59.142
Was it really my fault?

57:59.242 --> 58:01.277
Or was it society’s fault?
Maybe it was my parents’ fault.

58:01.377 --> 58:02.979
What’s the difference?

58:04.681 --> 58:06.549
It could’ve easily
been you, too.

58:06.649 --> 58:11.287
-No. No.
-Come on, Karen.

58:11.387 --> 58:13.056
Be honest with me.

58:13.122 --> 58:15.358
You’ve never driven
a car drunk before.

58:16.359 --> 58:17.727
Mm.

58:18.495 --> 58:20.063
Ah. See?

58:21.564 --> 58:23.199
We’re the same.

58:24.934 --> 58:26.369
No, we’re not.

58:27.871 --> 58:29.873
Anyway, I haven’t got
to the point of why

58:29.939 --> 58:31.708
I’m telling you this story.

58:31.774 --> 58:35.578
Yeah. You know why don’t you
tell me how this is a destiny?

58:39.716 --> 58:41.451
Because you...

58:43.453 --> 58:44.888
You’re my guardian angel.

58:44.988 --> 58:47.357
We’ll put you back together
again, okay?

58:47.457 --> 58:49.626
And now, we’re here together.

58:51.261 --> 58:52.529
Strong.

58:52.629 --> 58:55.532
[intense music]

58:55.632 --> 58:57.100
Finally.

59:00.837 --> 59:02.205
[glass shatters]

59:02.305 --> 59:04.340
[both grunting]

59:04.440 --> 59:05.642
Bitch!

59:09.045 --> 59:10.713
-No, please! No! Stop it!
-Down.

59:10.813 --> 59:12.549
Help me, please!

59:12.649 --> 59:14.617
[grunts] Stop.

59:14.717 --> 59:16.753
Let me go, please.
Help! Let me go, please!

59:16.853 --> 59:18.421
-Leave me!
-Stop, Karen!

59:18.521 --> 59:19.722
Please, stop!
Let me go, please!

59:19.789 --> 59:21.591
We’re meant to be together.

59:21.691 --> 59:23.026
-It’s destiny, Karen.
-Please, no, no, no, no!

59:23.092 --> 59:24.393
Stop fighting!

59:24.494 --> 59:25.728
[screaming] No! Let me go,
please! Stop...

59:25.828 --> 59:27.664
[muffled sobbing]

59:27.730 --> 59:28.765
[screaming] No!
God, please, don’t!

59:28.865 --> 59:31.301
Ah! No!
Please let me go!

59:31.367 --> 59:32.902
Oh, God! No, please,
please don’t!

59:33.002 --> 59:34.170
[thud]

59:35.004 --> 59:38.007
[dramatic music]

59:42.512 --> 59:45.515
[Karen shuddering]

59:46.516 --> 59:48.518
[muffled groaning]

59:58.661 --> 1:00:01.598
[breathing heavily]

1:00:04.233 --> 1:00:06.869
[both sobbing]

1:00:08.137 --> 1:00:09.439
[sighs]

1:00:10.373 --> 1:00:12.475
[Daniel] This is wrong.

1:00:12.575 --> 1:00:15.011
This is wrong, wrong, wrong.

1:00:15.111 --> 1:00:19.148
This was not how this
was supposed to be. [sighs]

1:00:19.215 --> 1:00:21.818
[muffled sobbing]

1:00:21.884 --> 1:00:24.087
You did this, both of you.

1:00:24.187 --> 1:00:26.389
Hope you know that.

1:00:27.824 --> 1:00:29.325
[sighs] Karen.

1:00:30.994 --> 1:00:33.162
I thought that you could see.

1:00:33.229 --> 1:00:35.298
I thought that you knew.

1:00:38.701 --> 1:00:40.470
[grunting]

1:00:40.570 --> 1:00:42.605
[shushing]

1:00:42.672 --> 1:00:44.107
It’s okay.

1:00:45.942 --> 1:00:48.544
[shushing]

1:00:50.847 --> 1:00:52.581
[whimpering]

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:57.086
You helped me once,
and I just trying to help you.

1:00:57.153 --> 1:00:59.422
Show you how tough I could be
when you were weak,

1:00:59.555 --> 1:01:02.659
when you needed someone,
and what did you do?

1:01:02.759 --> 1:01:04.727
You went and spit in my face.

1:01:07.397 --> 1:01:10.400
[music continues]

1:01:23.079 --> 1:01:25.181
[crickets chirping]

1:01:25.281 --> 1:01:28.284
[sighs, grunts]

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:37.026
[mumbling indistinctly]

1:01:40.930 --> 1:01:43.933
[dramatic music]

1:01:47.136 --> 1:01:48.938
Oh, my God!

1:01:53.710 --> 1:01:55.812
Oh, hey. Yeah, I, uh...

1:01:55.912 --> 1:01:57.380
I think my friend,
she’s in trouble, uh...

1:01:57.513 --> 1:01:58.981
[grunts]

1:02:03.119 --> 1:02:06.122
[music continues]

1:02:10.226 --> 1:02:13.329
I had hope going into this.
I hope you know that.

1:02:13.396 --> 1:02:15.031
I really did.

1:02:17.300 --> 1:02:20.036
But I’m not an idiot.
I’m not naive.

1:02:20.136 --> 1:02:23.372
-[Karen] No!
-I know what women are like.

1:02:23.473 --> 1:02:26.175
[muffled whimpering]

1:02:27.143 --> 1:02:30.313
You know, I wake up every day...

1:02:30.413 --> 1:02:31.814
[Izzie] No.

1:02:31.881 --> 1:02:33.149
And I try to make
a difference

1:02:33.249 --> 1:02:34.851
in someone’s life.

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:39.455
Something real.

1:02:39.555 --> 1:02:40.757
[exhales]

1:02:40.823 --> 1:02:43.326
[both whimpering]

1:02:45.762 --> 1:02:48.898
And tonight,
I did something for you.

1:02:48.965 --> 1:02:50.833
I did something for you, Karen.

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:53.236
And you didn’t even care. Hm?

1:02:53.302 --> 1:02:54.937
It didn’t matter to you.

1:02:56.672 --> 1:02:58.574
[grunting]

1:03:01.377 --> 1:03:02.411
Like I didn’t matter.

1:03:02.512 --> 1:03:04.113
[Karen grunting]

1:03:06.015 --> 1:03:08.084
I was wrong about you, Karen.

1:03:08.184 --> 1:03:10.419
[muffled screaming]

1:03:12.355 --> 1:03:15.091
-[muffled screaming]
-[knocking on door]

1:03:16.993 --> 1:03:18.628
[whispering]
Are you kidding me?

1:03:19.695 --> 1:03:20.997
Who’s that?

1:03:22.598 --> 1:03:25.468
Who is that?
You don’t know?

1:03:25.535 --> 1:03:27.370
If either of you make a sound,

1:03:27.503 --> 1:03:30.807
I’m gonna slit the other
one’s throat. Is that clear?

1:03:30.873 --> 1:03:32.809
-Yeah.
-[knocking on door]

1:03:39.148 --> 1:03:40.650
[knocking on door]

1:03:45.721 --> 1:03:48.357
-Who is it?
-[man] It’s me. Let me in.

1:03:53.029 --> 1:03:55.565
-[sniffles]
-Are you out of your damn mind?

1:03:55.665 --> 1:03:57.200
-How did you find me?
-I followed you here, man.

1:03:57.266 --> 1:03:58.767
What the hell
are you doing here?

1:03:58.868 --> 1:04:00.870
Open the door.
I’m not telling you again!

1:04:03.639 --> 1:04:06.409
[laughs] Nice!

1:04:07.743 --> 1:04:10.246
Hey, you remember me?

1:04:10.346 --> 1:04:12.014
How you doing?

1:04:13.916 --> 1:04:15.618
Hey, we need to talk.

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:17.453
About what?

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:19.355
[man] About this.

1:04:20.790 --> 1:04:22.324
What is that?

1:04:22.425 --> 1:04:23.826
[man] Remember the drunk guy
who was here earlier?

1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:25.628
He was just about ready
to call the cops.

1:04:25.728 --> 1:04:27.630
But I put a stop to that.

1:04:27.730 --> 1:04:31.267
Yeah, I thought you might need
my help, so I stuck around.

1:04:31.334 --> 1:04:34.103
It’s a good thing for you
that I did.

1:04:40.009 --> 1:04:42.311
What do you want me
to do about that?

1:04:42.411 --> 1:04:45.681
Well, this obviously goes
above and beyond

1:04:45.748 --> 1:04:46.782
what we first discussed.

1:04:46.883 --> 1:04:48.050
I assume you want me

1:04:48.184 --> 1:04:49.852
to take care of the body.

1:04:51.387 --> 1:04:53.489
Look, I don’t have
any more money.

1:04:53.556 --> 1:04:54.891
I gave you everything, okay?

1:04:55.024 --> 1:04:56.525
Is that right?

1:04:56.592 --> 1:04:58.361
Well, then, you’re just gonna
have to find a way

1:04:58.427 --> 1:05:01.230
to come up with some more,
won’t you?

1:05:01.364 --> 1:05:04.367
[intense music]

1:05:08.137 --> 1:05:09.538
[Daniel]
We gotta get out of here.

1:05:09.639 --> 1:05:11.307
[man] Yeah, well,
where are we gonna go?

1:05:11.374 --> 1:05:12.875
We’re gonna go to her house.

1:05:12.975 --> 1:05:14.176
And what are we gonna
do with them?

1:05:14.277 --> 1:05:15.344
You’re gonna pick ’em up
and you’re gonna

1:05:15.444 --> 1:05:16.679
put ’em in her car.

1:05:17.914 --> 1:05:19.315
Fine.

1:05:23.653 --> 1:05:25.021
Come here. Let’s go.

1:05:25.121 --> 1:05:28.157
[Karen grunting] No!

1:05:31.894 --> 1:05:34.230
[Karen grunting]

1:05:38.134 --> 1:05:41.103
[man] You get in there and
keep quiet. Don’t say a word.

1:05:43.506 --> 1:05:46.442
[dramatic music]

1:05:51.247 --> 1:05:53.582
Where’s Karen?
Where’s my friend?

1:05:53.683 --> 1:05:55.551
-She’s fine.
-Don’t tell me she’s fine.

1:05:55.651 --> 1:05:57.820
I don’t trust you.
And who is this guy?

1:05:59.088 --> 1:06:01.657
-Karen! Izzie!
-[muffled grunting]

1:06:01.724 --> 1:06:03.392
Get off of me!

1:06:03.492 --> 1:06:05.227
Get off of me!
Get off of...

1:06:05.328 --> 1:06:07.196
[Rhonnie] What are you doing?
What...

1:06:07.296 --> 1:06:10.866
Let go! Stop it!

1:06:10.967 --> 1:06:12.635
-[man grunting]
-[bone crunches]

1:06:18.474 --> 1:06:19.842
Let’s go.

1:06:24.113 --> 1:06:27.116
[dramatic music]

1:06:29.785 --> 1:06:31.220
[engine starts]

1:06:40.062 --> 1:06:42.031
[car engine revving]

1:06:48.170 --> 1:06:51.173
[dramatic music]

1:06:56.645 --> 1:06:59.181
[crickets chirping]

1:07:12.528 --> 1:07:14.997
Come on, come on.
Let’s move.

1:07:15.097 --> 1:07:16.599
[grunts] Come on.

1:07:16.665 --> 1:07:19.635
-[muffled grunting]
-Shh!

1:07:22.505 --> 1:07:24.974
[indistinct chatter]

1:07:28.911 --> 1:07:31.180
[man] Let’s go inside.

1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:33.149
Move! Come on!

1:07:35.284 --> 1:07:38.287
[music continues]

1:07:38.921 --> 1:07:40.122
[door shuts]

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:46.829
[man] Looking good,
pretty little thing.

1:07:46.896 --> 1:07:49.265
[laughs] Come here, come here.
Don’t be nervous.

1:07:49.365 --> 1:07:51.233
Don’t be shy. Come on.
Come here, come here.

1:07:51.333 --> 1:07:52.835
-Hey.
-Come on.

1:07:52.902 --> 1:07:54.970
[Daniel]
Hey! Get away from her!

1:07:55.037 --> 1:07:57.006
Hey. Hey!

1:07:57.940 --> 1:08:00.142
Or what? Huh?

1:08:00.209 --> 1:08:01.377
What you gonna do?

1:08:01.477 --> 1:08:02.912
This has gone way beyond

1:08:02.978 --> 1:08:04.380
staging some little fist fight

1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:06.348
and taking a couple of shots
to the jaw.

1:08:06.449 --> 1:08:09.351
And you don’t think I know that?

1:08:09.452 --> 1:08:12.955
Look, I’m real sorry that your
weird little courtship ritual

1:08:13.055 --> 1:08:14.289
has gone sideways here.

1:08:14.356 --> 1:08:16.058
-Shut up!
-But it’s not my fault!

1:08:16.125 --> 1:08:17.426
Shut up and let me think.

1:08:17.493 --> 1:08:19.762
Whatever, man,
just stay out of my way.

1:08:19.829 --> 1:08:21.397
Come here.

1:08:21.464 --> 1:08:24.266
[sighs] This is wrong.
This is wrong.

1:08:25.301 --> 1:08:27.069
This is wrong. Damn it!

1:08:28.003 --> 1:08:29.538
Hey! Stop!

1:08:29.605 --> 1:08:31.373
Did you somehow
get the impression

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:33.075
that I was still working
for you?

1:08:34.210 --> 1:08:37.113
I didn’t think so.
Come here.

1:08:37.213 --> 1:08:39.115
Yeah. Back to what I was doing.

1:08:39.215 --> 1:08:41.250
-Yeah, come here.
-Hey, what...

1:08:41.350 --> 1:08:42.885
What the hell
do you think you’re doing, man?

1:08:42.985 --> 1:08:45.254
I’m taking my compensation!

1:08:45.354 --> 1:08:48.157
-You got a problem with that?
-You’re disgusting.

1:08:48.224 --> 1:08:50.726
Look, you’re not paying me to
take the fall for you this time.

1:08:50.826 --> 1:08:52.528
So just back up off of me!

1:08:52.628 --> 1:08:54.296
[intense music]

1:08:56.665 --> 1:08:58.667
Come on, let’s go upstairs.
Come on, come on.

1:08:58.767 --> 1:09:00.436
Come on.
Now, I’m looking at you.

1:09:00.503 --> 1:09:01.971
Now, I’m not that bad, anyways.

1:09:02.071 --> 1:09:04.473
[laughs] Come on, let’s go.
Let’s go. Come on.

1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:06.142
Let’s go upstairs.
You and me, yeah.

1:09:06.208 --> 1:09:07.776
Yeah, you and me, huh?
Yeah, come on.

1:09:07.843 --> 1:09:09.145
I’ve waited for this
for a long time.

1:09:09.245 --> 1:09:10.546
Come on, come on.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:09:10.646 --> 1:09:11.947
No. Don’t be like that.

1:09:12.047 --> 1:09:13.649
No, not gonna hurt you, okay?

1:09:13.749 --> 1:09:14.984
Come on, come on.
Let’s go, let’s go.

1:09:15.084 --> 1:09:16.552
We’ll go have a good time, huh?

1:09:16.619 --> 1:09:18.320
[laughs, grunts]

1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:20.890
[grunting] Come on.
Ow! What did you do?

1:09:20.956 --> 1:09:22.958
[grunting]

1:09:23.058 --> 1:09:25.394
No! Ugh!

1:09:25.461 --> 1:09:30.065
What did you do? What did you...
[groaning]

1:09:30.166 --> 1:09:31.667
I just injected you
with a lethal dose

1:09:31.734 --> 1:09:33.435
of carbon tetrachloride.

1:09:33.569 --> 1:09:36.005
The chemical is attacking
your central nervous system

1:09:36.071 --> 1:09:37.873
right now, mostly your liver
and your kidneys.

1:09:37.973 --> 1:09:40.142
It works very fast.

1:09:40.242 --> 1:09:43.345
Yeah, your, uh, pulse
is already slowing.

1:09:43.412 --> 1:09:45.548
Your blood pressure is dropping.

1:09:45.648 --> 1:09:47.950
Karen, I’m so sorry.

1:09:48.017 --> 1:09:50.052
I’m so sorry.

1:09:50.152 --> 1:09:55.858
Look... I know I’m not perfect.
Okay?

1:09:55.958 --> 1:09:59.161
But, but, look,
now I really did save you.

1:09:59.295 --> 1:10:00.462
Right?

1:10:01.964 --> 1:10:03.632
Look, I know, I know the way

1:10:03.732 --> 1:10:05.434
that I went about proving it
to you before.

1:10:05.501 --> 1:10:07.903
It was flawed.
I get it, it was flawed.

1:10:07.970 --> 1:10:10.973
But, now this, look!

1:10:11.073 --> 1:10:12.674
This really is destiny.

1:10:12.775 --> 1:10:15.177
Right? Right?

1:10:17.813 --> 1:10:20.115
[man choking]

1:10:20.216 --> 1:10:22.351
Oh, he’s not dying. Okay.

1:10:22.451 --> 1:10:23.852
I’m gonna take care of this,
okay?

1:10:23.919 --> 1:10:26.388
I’ll be right back.
I’m gonna protect you.

1:10:26.455 --> 1:10:28.357
Okay?

1:10:28.424 --> 1:10:29.458
Okay.

1:10:30.759 --> 1:10:33.262
[man groaning]

1:10:36.265 --> 1:10:39.268
[dramatic music]

1:10:58.954 --> 1:11:00.455
[door opens]

1:11:00.522 --> 1:11:02.825
You know what I’m really
made of now, Karen.

1:11:02.925 --> 1:11:04.326
[clattering]

1:11:09.431 --> 1:11:11.767
The kind of man I truly am.

1:11:14.703 --> 1:11:15.804
Karen, in light of everything,

1:11:15.938 --> 1:11:17.373
do you think you could...

1:11:21.944 --> 1:11:23.445
Karen?

1:11:28.183 --> 1:11:30.719
[panting]

1:11:37.159 --> 1:11:40.029
Hurry. He’s gonna know we didn’t
go out the front door.

1:11:40.162 --> 1:11:41.563
Don’t forget.

1:11:43.832 --> 1:11:46.135
[breathing heavily]

1:11:46.201 --> 1:11:47.636
-Okay.
-Hurry.

1:11:47.703 --> 1:11:49.271
Get these off of me.

1:11:49.338 --> 1:11:50.839
My hands are turning purple.

1:11:50.939 --> 1:11:52.174
I don’t think
it’s gonna work.

1:11:52.274 --> 1:11:53.709
[whimpering]

1:11:53.809 --> 1:11:55.177
[Izzie grunts]

1:12:04.219 --> 1:12:05.788
Karen?

1:12:07.222 --> 1:12:08.624
Karen?

1:12:10.392 --> 1:12:12.061
Karen?

1:12:12.127 --> 1:12:13.529
Karen?

1:12:14.897 --> 1:12:16.098
[pounding on door]

1:12:16.198 --> 1:12:18.033
[gasping]

1:12:20.002 --> 1:12:21.003
Karen?

1:12:21.070 --> 1:12:22.404
Karen!

1:12:27.343 --> 1:12:28.410
[grunting]

1:12:33.849 --> 1:12:34.817
Ah.

1:12:34.950 --> 1:12:36.518
-Yeah.
-Okay?

1:12:37.686 --> 1:12:38.987
Karen!

1:12:39.121 --> 1:12:40.689
Karen, please.

1:12:40.789 --> 1:12:43.792
Karen...
Karen, I need to talk to you.

1:12:43.859 --> 1:12:45.994
Karen, please,
I need you to understand!

1:12:46.095 --> 1:12:47.596
[gasping]

1:12:47.663 --> 1:12:49.064
Oh, come on, come on,
come on.

1:12:49.131 --> 1:12:51.133
[keys clacking]

1:12:51.233 --> 1:12:53.068
Come on.

1:12:53.135 --> 1:12:54.970
How do you, uh, call 911
from a computer?

1:12:55.070 --> 1:12:57.506
I don’t know.
I have no idea.

1:12:57.606 --> 1:12:58.974
Put... Post on social media.

1:12:59.074 --> 1:13:00.476
Okay. That’s a good idea.

1:13:02.644 --> 1:13:03.612
[sighs]

1:13:03.712 --> 1:13:05.647
[grunting]
Karen, please.

1:13:05.748 --> 1:13:06.949
[Izzie] Tell everyone you know
on social media

1:13:07.049 --> 1:13:08.250
to call the police.

1:13:08.350 --> 1:13:10.018
Karen, what are you doing
in there?

1:13:17.559 --> 1:13:18.761
Mm.

1:13:19.862 --> 1:13:21.663
[sighs]
Looking up.

1:13:23.399 --> 1:13:25.901
[clattering]

1:13:26.001 --> 1:13:27.035
[grunts]

1:13:27.136 --> 1:13:30.139
[dramatic music]

1:13:31.306 --> 1:13:32.908
Okay.

1:13:33.008 --> 1:13:35.411
-What happened?
-It’s not working.

1:13:35.477 --> 1:13:37.012
No. Oh, my God.

1:13:37.112 --> 1:13:38.680
[sighs]
He cut the modem.

1:13:38.781 --> 1:13:39.915
-Okay.
-I got one--

1:13:40.015 --> 1:13:41.250
[pounding on door]

1:13:41.950 --> 1:13:43.786
[grunting]

1:13:43.919 --> 1:13:45.254
Karen!

1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:46.955
[grunting]
Karen, please come talk to me.

1:13:47.055 --> 1:13:48.390
Karen!

1:13:48.457 --> 1:13:51.493
[grunting]
Karen? Karen!

1:13:51.593 --> 1:13:53.362
[Izzie] He’s gonna break down
the door.

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:55.230
[Daniel] Karen!

1:13:55.297 --> 1:13:57.232
Karen!
Karen, I just wanna talk to you.

1:13:57.299 --> 1:13:59.401
Karen, why are you doing this
to us?

1:13:59.468 --> 1:14:00.936
-Karen!
-I don’t wanna talk to you.

1:14:01.036 --> 1:14:02.271
-Karen!
-Ah!

1:14:02.371 --> 1:14:03.739
Karen, I just wanna talk to you.

1:14:03.806 --> 1:14:05.240
Why are you doing this to us?

1:14:09.745 --> 1:14:12.147
What, what are you doing?
Just leave us alone.

1:14:12.214 --> 1:14:13.882
I just wanna talk to you,
Karen.

1:14:13.982 --> 1:14:16.385
I just wanna talk to you.
Just wanna talk to you. Okay?

1:14:16.452 --> 1:14:18.821
[panting]

1:14:18.887 --> 1:14:21.323
-[screams]
-[thuds]

1:14:22.558 --> 1:14:25.627
[grunting]

1:14:30.866 --> 1:14:33.569
Shh, it’s okay, it’s okay,
it’s okay.

1:14:33.669 --> 1:14:35.203
Karen, it’s okay. Shh.

1:14:35.304 --> 1:14:36.505
It’s okay, Karen.

1:14:36.605 --> 1:14:38.774
It’s okay. I got you.

1:14:38.841 --> 1:14:40.008
Yeah.

1:14:41.076 --> 1:14:42.978
It’s okay.

1:14:43.078 --> 1:14:44.480
It’s okay.

1:14:49.318 --> 1:14:51.320
[shovel scraping]

1:14:54.556 --> 1:14:57.059
[dramatic music]

1:14:58.727 --> 1:15:00.729
[Daniel grunting]

1:15:21.350 --> 1:15:23.618
I thought I can make you see.

1:15:23.719 --> 1:15:26.021
[sighs]
I tried, Karen.

1:15:32.127 --> 1:15:34.596
[sighs]
I tried so hard.

1:15:38.700 --> 1:15:41.603
As soon as I met you
in the hospital that day...

1:15:43.405 --> 1:15:46.575
I knew that you needed me
in your life.

1:15:46.642 --> 1:15:48.143
What?

1:15:48.243 --> 1:15:49.912
I mean, I was
in a pretty bad shape,

1:15:49.978 --> 1:15:52.380
but you...

1:15:52.447 --> 1:15:54.283
you were lost.

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:57.019
I treated you?

1:15:58.086 --> 1:16:00.322
[Daniel] Sure, you did.

1:16:00.389 --> 1:16:02.624
Remember that story
I was telling you earlier?

1:16:03.926 --> 1:16:05.928
Well, it gets better.

1:16:08.030 --> 1:16:09.765
What are you talking about?

1:16:12.501 --> 1:16:14.336
[Daniel] When I was in
the ambulance, the paramedics,

1:16:14.403 --> 1:16:17.306
they, they did such a good job
with CPR on me,

1:16:17.372 --> 1:16:18.840
they broke my sternum
in three places.

1:16:18.907 --> 1:16:20.375
It hurt like a son of a bitch.

1:16:20.475 --> 1:16:22.678
But they weren’t the ones
who saved my life.

1:16:24.479 --> 1:16:26.348
That was you, Karen.

1:16:28.684 --> 1:16:31.553
You saved my life.

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:35.557
You are my guardian angel.

1:16:37.492 --> 1:16:40.896
And I fell in love with you
in that very moment.

1:16:40.963 --> 1:16:43.599
I knew right then
that I had to have you.

1:16:45.767 --> 1:16:47.402
But it took me years

1:16:47.469 --> 1:16:50.138
<i>to recover from my injuries,</i>

1:16:50.238 --> 1:16:52.608
jail time and...

1:16:52.708 --> 1:16:54.509
self-hatred and the alcoholism.

1:16:54.610 --> 1:16:58.614
But I’m now here with you
finally.

1:17:01.216 --> 1:17:02.618
Now what matters
is that you and I

1:17:02.718 --> 1:17:04.553
are together finally.

1:17:06.888 --> 1:17:08.624
There’s chemistry between us.

1:17:10.125 --> 1:17:12.494
I know that you can feel it,
Karen.

1:17:12.594 --> 1:17:14.997
In fact, you tried
to kiss me earlier.

1:17:20.836 --> 1:17:24.539
You know, after you
put me back together that night,

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:28.176
I heard you fighting
with your supervisors.

1:17:28.276 --> 1:17:30.612
Everybody there could tell
that you were broken.

1:17:30.679 --> 1:17:32.547
You were strung out, Karen.

1:17:34.916 --> 1:17:36.451
But I saw strength.

1:17:38.220 --> 1:17:39.621
Potential.

1:17:41.289 --> 1:17:43.525
Even after you had
everything stripped from you,

1:17:43.592 --> 1:17:45.027
I saw you.

1:17:47.029 --> 1:17:48.397
And I watched you.

1:17:49.665 --> 1:17:51.166
For years,
I watched you, Karen.

1:17:51.233 --> 1:17:52.668
I watched you heal.

1:17:55.904 --> 1:17:57.539
I watched you grow.

1:18:00.175 --> 1:18:01.410
But now...

1:18:03.378 --> 1:18:05.514
after all
I’ve invested in you...

1:18:09.851 --> 1:18:12.988
you still don’t see me
for who I am.

1:18:13.121 --> 1:18:14.523
And that hurts.

1:18:16.024 --> 1:18:17.158
I’m not made of stone,

1:18:17.259 --> 1:18:20.662
I’m strong
but not unbreakable.

1:18:20.762 --> 1:18:22.798
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

1:18:22.864 --> 1:18:24.633
I did everything I could, Karen.

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:25.967
But it wasn’t enough.

1:18:26.068 --> 1:18:28.470
-[Izzie] No.
-It wasn’t enough.

1:18:28.570 --> 1:18:30.605
[screaming]

1:18:31.173 --> 1:18:33.241
[grunting]

1:18:34.476 --> 1:18:35.911
[Daniel] Better.

1:18:35.977 --> 1:18:37.479
-Shh. There, there.
-[Izzie] No, no.

1:18:37.579 --> 1:18:38.947
There, there.

1:18:45.454 --> 1:18:48.023
[both grunting]

1:18:53.428 --> 1:18:54.863
What did you do, Karen?

1:18:56.231 --> 1:18:58.166
Ah, what did you do?

1:18:58.233 --> 1:19:00.335
[panting]

1:19:07.676 --> 1:19:09.311
[grunts]

1:19:10.479 --> 1:19:13.014
[instrumental music]

1:19:18.286 --> 1:19:20.555
Izzie?
Hey, wake up.

1:19:20.622 --> 1:19:22.257
Wake up. Oh, my God.

1:19:22.324 --> 1:19:23.792
Okay, wake up.

1:19:23.925 --> 1:19:25.093
Hang on.

1:19:33.635 --> 1:19:35.403
Breathe for me. Just breathe.

1:19:35.470 --> 1:19:37.239
Just breathe for me.

1:19:37.305 --> 1:19:38.540
Is my friend gonna be okay?

1:19:38.607 --> 1:19:39.708
We’re gonna get her
to the hospital

1:19:39.775 --> 1:19:41.276
and on dialysis, ASAP.

1:19:43.211 --> 1:19:44.546
I’m coming!

1:19:44.646 --> 1:19:45.881
She’s in good hands.

1:19:45.947 --> 1:19:48.950
[music continues]

1:20:23.552 --> 1:20:25.453
[woman] Ma’am?

1:20:25.554 --> 1:20:28.990
Ma’am, I need to ask you
a couple of questions.

1:20:29.090 --> 1:20:32.360
Um, I just wanna make sure
that my friend is okay.

1:20:32.427 --> 1:20:34.262
That’s okay, I’ll take you
to the hospital after this,

1:20:34.362 --> 1:20:37.199
but first, I need you to tell me
what happened here last night.

1:20:43.672 --> 1:20:45.106
Ma’am?

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:46.341
Ma’am?

1:21:06.528 --> 1:21:09.030
[dramatic music]

1:21:10.732 --> 1:21:12.734
[indistinct radio chatter]

1:21:18.707 --> 1:21:21.643
[car engine starts]

1:21:35.023 --> 1:21:37.025
[instrumental music]

1:21:38.727 --> 1:21:41.596
[Anne]<i> Her main focus
has been to serve others.</i>

1:21:41.696 --> 1:21:44.566
She’s practiced rigorous honesty

1:21:44.699 --> 1:21:45.867
and she’s been a pillar

1:21:45.934 --> 1:21:48.303
to not only me
but to our whole group.

1:21:49.871 --> 1:21:52.874
Needless to say,
this has been a hell of a year

1:21:52.974 --> 1:21:54.409
for our friend, Karen.

1:21:54.509 --> 1:21:56.311
But, today, we celebrate.

1:21:56.378 --> 1:21:59.915
We celebrate 365 days
of sobriety.

1:21:59.981 --> 1:22:02.017
[applause]

1:22:04.753 --> 1:22:06.254
And to make it even sweeter,

1:22:06.321 --> 1:22:07.656
she was just informed

1:22:07.756 --> 1:22:10.558
that they’re reinstating
her medical license.

1:22:10.625 --> 1:22:14.496
Karen, you are the strongest,
most resilient woman

1:22:14.596 --> 1:22:16.164
I have ever known.

1:22:16.264 --> 1:22:20.635
And your story is gonna
inspire people your whole life.

1:22:20.735 --> 1:22:23.571
Just like it inspired
all of us in this group.

1:22:24.973 --> 1:22:26.107
And we’re so blessed to have
with us

1:22:26.207 --> 1:22:28.543
a special guest today,

1:22:28.610 --> 1:22:30.745
Karen’s best friend, Izzie.

1:22:30.845 --> 1:22:32.247
[chuckles]

1:22:33.548 --> 1:22:36.251
Karen...

1:22:36.351 --> 1:22:39.554
To say that we’ve been through
a lot would be...

1:22:39.654 --> 1:22:41.089
an understatement.

1:22:42.824 --> 1:22:46.161
I love you more than anything.

1:22:46.227 --> 1:22:47.462
I love you, too.

1:22:48.563 --> 1:22:51.433
And even in your
darkest moments,

1:22:51.499 --> 1:22:54.502
even in my darkest moment...

1:22:56.104 --> 1:22:57.806
you were there for me.

1:23:00.041 --> 1:23:02.344
And even though
I’m older than you,

1:23:02.444 --> 1:23:05.347
only slightly older than you...

1:23:06.881 --> 1:23:09.651
I really look up to you, Karen.

1:23:11.586 --> 1:23:13.621
Congratulations, honey.

1:23:15.457 --> 1:23:17.959
[dramatic music]

1:23:23.231 --> 1:23:25.400
I thought
I could make you see.

1:23:27.268 --> 1:23:29.404
You are still so blind.

1:23:33.174 --> 1:23:35.010
Karen?

1:23:35.076 --> 1:23:36.544
Karen?

1:23:37.512 --> 1:23:38.947
Hey.

1:23:39.014 --> 1:23:42.017
[music continues]

1:23:57.632 --> 1:23:59.100
You okay?

1:24:01.736 --> 1:24:04.072
Yeah. Yeah.

1:24:07.876 --> 1:24:10.812
[Anne] Uh, Karen, hon,
come on up here.

1:24:10.912 --> 1:24:13.581
We’ve got something for you.
[laughing]

1:24:13.681 --> 1:24:16.684
[applause]

1:24:20.455 --> 1:24:21.990
Congratulations.

1:24:25.226 --> 1:24:29.164
Okay. We got ice cream and cake
out in the hall.

1:24:29.230 --> 1:24:30.432
So let’s go celebrate.

1:24:30.532 --> 1:24:33.334
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

1:24:33.401 --> 1:24:35.370
