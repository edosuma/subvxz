WEBVTT

00:18.686 --> 00:21.289
(grumbles)

00:33.367 --> 00:35.002
Oh, God!

00:35.035 --> 00:36.204
Hey, sleepyhead.
(chuckles)

00:36.237 --> 00:37.605
(groans)

00:37.638 --> 00:39.907
How long you been staring at me?

00:39.940 --> 00:41.742
Mm, about
an hour.
(groans)

00:41.775 --> 00:43.944
Hey, what were you dreaming
about?

00:43.977 --> 00:46.780
Plummeting into an abyss.
Same as usual.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.750
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm used to coming in here

00:49.783 --> 00:51.585
to wake up Pop every morning.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.855
You know? He'd be laying right
there, right where you are,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.258
just scratching all over 'cause
of his skin thing. (chuckles)

00:57.291 --> 01:00.694
I'd tell him, "Pop,
don't scratch, you know?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.464
You got to let
that scab over."

01:03.497 --> 01:05.133
But guess what,
he'd keep digging.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.568
You know what,
you have a good cry.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.437
I'm gonna go
boil myself.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.605
(Eric chuckles)

01:11.639 --> 01:13.607
Nice setup.
What, do you clean deer in here?

01:13.641 --> 01:17.678
(chuckles)
You're crazy. Uh, no.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.814
(water running)
You know,

01:20.848 --> 01:24.452
I used to sing to Pop when
he was in the shower. (chuckles)

01:24.485 --> 01:27.488
Would, uh, would you, would you
want me to sing to you or...?

01:28.322 --> 01:30.491
"Pobudka"?

01:30.524 --> 01:33.127
(singing in Polish)

01:37.331 --> 01:40.768
(both singing in Polish)

01:42.336 --> 01:44.438
Coffee.
Can you get me a coffee?

01:49.643 --> 01:52.280
(chanting in Sanskrit)

01:54.148 --> 01:56.484
CARYN:
Hey, new roomie.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.287
What you doing? You...
chanting something there?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.821
It's a Buddhist prayer,

02:00.854 --> 02:03.691
that all beings should be happy
and free of suffering.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.294
Oh, my God, I love that.
Can I try?

02:06.327 --> 02:08.362
Um, sure.

02:08.396 --> 02:09.997
Okay.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.700
Oh. (scoffs)

02:12.733 --> 02:14.902
I'm sore
from my pole dancing class.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.272
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.640
Lokah...

02:19.673 --> 02:21.275
Lokah...

02:21.309 --> 02:23.277
Samastah...
Samastah...

02:23.311 --> 02:25.279
Sukhino...
(humming)

02:25.313 --> 02:27.147
Bhavantu...
Ba-ba-bum.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.850
(phone ringing and buzzing)
Lokah...
Lokah...

02:29.883 --> 02:31.485
Samastah...

02:31.519 --> 02:32.953
Lokah...

02:32.986 --> 02:34.822
No, we've moved on to samastah.

02:34.855 --> 02:35.823
Banana.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.158
Okay, just take the call.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.029
(groans)
Hey, Nana.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.198
I can finally die happy.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.499
Oh, great.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.567
Why is that, exactly?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.369
Your mother told me.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.205
You're marrying
that doctor fella.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.506
(grunts)
Damn it.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.807
I forgot to tell my mom

02:53.841 --> 02:55.409
I broke it off with Howard
last night.

02:55.443 --> 02:58.011
So, when are you gonna bring
the man to Florida?

02:58.045 --> 03:00.248
I need to meet him before I die.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.350
Which, according
to my latest CAT scan,

03:02.383 --> 03:03.751
should've been yesterday.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.587
Aw.
Um, Nana, can I call
you right back?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.322
Caryn?

03:08.356 --> 03:09.523
Just keep going
with the serenity thing.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.825
I have to go rip my mom
a new one.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.227
What are you trying
to do here, Caryn?

03:13.261 --> 03:14.662
You trying to kill
your grandmother?

03:14.695 --> 03:15.829
No, Ma, of course

03:15.863 --> 03:17.164
I don't want to hurt Nana,

03:17.197 --> 03:18.866
but I just,
I can't marry Howard.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.201
There's no passion.
Again with the passion.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.237
Caryn, do you think I don't want
to push your father

03:23.271 --> 03:25.706
in front of the seven train
every single day of my life?

03:25.739 --> 03:27.775
But I don't push!

03:27.808 --> 03:29.910
That's the passion
in the not pushing.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.446
Cousin Stosh?

03:32.480 --> 03:34.415
What?
Hey.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.250
There is a scary woman
on our front stoop.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.918
She says she's looking for, um,

03:37.951 --> 03:40.721
"that lying bastard
who won't return my calls."

03:40.754 --> 03:42.556
Any idea who that could be?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.091
Does she have a crossbow?

03:44.124 --> 03:45.626
Crossbow?

03:45.659 --> 03:46.894
Yes.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.862
Yeah?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.864
Okay, come on, come on.
We got to go.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.600
You know, she's, uh,

03:52.633 --> 03:54.435
she's pretty good
with that thing, too, you know.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.704
Almost made
the '04 Olympic team,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.071
but, apparently,

03:58.105 --> 04:00.073
it was very political.
Coach had his favorites.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.409
WOMAN: Stosh, I know you're
up there, you son of a bitch!

04:01.442 --> 04:03.311
All right,
I'm gonna be next door.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.945
This is what I need you
to do for me.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.114
I need you to get my two-button
slim cut Periyali suit,

04:07.147 --> 04:08.382
my Marcel Sarenti wingtips,

04:08.416 --> 04:10.217
Stosh!
black socks,

04:10.250 --> 04:12.119
white undershirt,
slate gray dress shirt,

04:12.152 --> 04:13.754
Fabienne blue tie.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.122
You know what, Zenito pink tie.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.991
Stosh!
Actually, just get all my ties.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.928
All right, fine,
Miss Head in the Clouds,

04:20.961 --> 04:22.129
romance unicorn person.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.597
You just keep waiting

04:23.631 --> 04:25.766
for the perfect guy to just fall
from the sky.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.301
(groans)

04:27.335 --> 04:28.636
How did you get in here?

04:28.669 --> 04:29.970
You got some clothes
I can borrow?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.439
Is that Howard?
No, get out of my house.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.906
Help me out here,
help me out.
Who's there?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.475
Hello?
Bottom drawer's the fat drawer.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.477
Hello, Caryn?
Look, Ma, I got to go.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.346
Can you please just call Nana
and tell her?

04:38.379 --> 04:39.513
Uh-uh.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.648
This is your mess.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.316
You get on a plane to Florida,

04:42.350 --> 04:43.684
you rent a sensible car,

04:43.717 --> 04:45.185
and you drive to Golden Meadows

04:45.218 --> 04:47.521
and rip your grandmother's heart
out in person.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.289
You're overdue
for a visit anyway.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.358
Fine.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.925
Bye.
I'm keeping these

04:51.959 --> 04:55.228
till you get fat again.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.606
Two! English.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.708
New reservat... Nope.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.009
No, you robot idiot.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.144
New reservation.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.680
Oh.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.782
Oh, good, good, good. Thank you.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.684
Rambo still out there?

05:16.717 --> 05:18.318
(chuckles)
No.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.153
She had a spin class.
Oh.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.289
(sighs) Hey, how'd she know
where to find you, anyway?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.658
You know, I'm pretty sure
she did something to my phone.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.361
My GPS keeps trying to steer me
into oncoming traffic.

05:27.395 --> 05:30.531
So, what do you want
to do today, Cousin Stosh?

05:30.564 --> 05:32.666
You want to hang out,
just me and you,

05:32.700 --> 05:33.901
the men?
You know,

05:33.934 --> 05:35.669
I got kind
of a big meeting today.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.237
How about, uh, tomorrow?

05:37.270 --> 05:38.506
Tomorrow's, uh,

05:38.539 --> 05:39.740
tomorrow is really up
in the air.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.141
It's just,

05:41.174 --> 05:42.510
you had said yesterday you were
moving in

05:42.543 --> 05:44.512
to keep me company
now that Pop was gone.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.813
Yeah, absolutely.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.482
So, just, uh, maybe sometime
next week.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.883
You know, I'm starting to feel
a little bit smothered.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.519
So, on that return flight,

05:51.552 --> 05:53.153
do you think I could have
a window seat?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.155
A middle seat it is. Perfect.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.591
And yes, yes, I will hold again.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.560
This is going to be
a fun trip

05:59.593 --> 06:00.828
to Golden Meadows tomorrow.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.730
"Oh, what's that, Nana?

06:02.763 --> 06:03.931
"What's the one thing

06:03.964 --> 06:05.165
"you said would give you

06:05.198 --> 06:06.567
"eternal peace and happiness?

06:06.600 --> 06:09.537
Well, it ain't gonna happen."

06:10.370 --> 06:13.106
Should I just marry the guy?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.908
And this one...
CARYN: Howard!

06:14.942 --> 06:16.009
(knocking on door,
door opens)

06:16.043 --> 06:17.077
Hi.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.879
Hi. He knows me.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.047
Caryn, what are you doing here?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.281
I told the nurse it was urgent

06:21.314 --> 06:22.516
because it is.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.051
Howard, it really is.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.786
(sighs)
Okay, what is it?

06:25.819 --> 06:28.422
Okay, so, tomorrow,
I am getting on a plane

06:28.456 --> 06:30.691
to go see Nana in Florida
at her nursing home,

06:30.724 --> 06:33.594
and I want you to come with me.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.862
That's right,

06:34.895 --> 06:36.396
I want you to come with me,

06:36.430 --> 06:38.799
and I want you to stand
next to me at her bedside

06:38.832 --> 06:41.569
and say, "Nana, Caryn and I
are getting married."

06:41.602 --> 06:44.204
Wait, are-are you saying
you've changed your mind?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.539
You do want to get married?

06:45.573 --> 06:46.640
That is definitely one option.

06:46.674 --> 06:47.775
I love that option.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.376
But here's the thing,

06:49.409 --> 06:50.911
the world tries to put people
in a box.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.480
It tries to say
you're either married

06:52.513 --> 06:53.914
or you're not married,

06:53.947 --> 06:55.883
and you know what I say?
Screw that noise.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.918
I say, let's fly
to Florida together,

06:57.951 --> 06:59.319
tell Nana we're getting married

06:59.352 --> 07:01.755
and just let our hearts decide
what's next.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.090
Maybe we do get married.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.793
Maybe we go to dinner
once a month

07:05.826 --> 07:06.994
while we date other people.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.729
Maybe we only date other people.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.630
I don't know.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.131
So, if you're with me,

07:11.164 --> 07:13.233
let's go to Florida.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.669
Caryn...
Are you coming to Florida?

07:15.703 --> 07:18.105
I am examining moles.
Please leave.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.309
Leave.

07:22.342 --> 07:25.312
Okay, okay.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.787
Hey, neighbor.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.324
What you doing?

07:37.357 --> 07:39.426
Ah, just killing time
till my shift starts.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.996
In an hour,
it'll be 13 hours to go.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.798
How'd you spend
your days before?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.868
You know, I'd just
hang out with my dad.

07:47.901 --> 07:51.539
He-he used to call me his,
uh, glupie kozy.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.773
Aw, what does that mean?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.041
Stupid goat.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.310
And here come the waterworks.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.280
Oh, Eric.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.182
(groans)

08:02.215 --> 08:04.184
Aw.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.053
What would put a smile
on your face, huh?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.354
A balloon?

08:07.387 --> 08:08.522
A zebra with a hat?

08:08.556 --> 08:10.157
That's really not my thing.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.825
Sorry.

08:11.859 --> 08:15.729
Honestly, I just wish
I could talk to my pop.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.365
You know, just one last time.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.634
But...

08:20.668 --> 08:22.536
that'll never happen.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.839
(chanting):
Spirit of Eric's father,

08:25.873 --> 08:29.843
please honor us
with your presence.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.579
This is dumb.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.682
And I'm not supposed
to have pillows on the floor.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.349
Spirit of Eric's father,

08:36.383 --> 08:38.518
please honor us
with your presence.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.653
Eric,

08:39.687 --> 08:41.521
he's here.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.257
You may speak to him now,
and he'll respond through me.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.425
Oh, yeah, okay.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.227
I'm gonna talk
to my dead father.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.696
Right.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.831
Um...

08:50.864 --> 08:52.432
good morning, Pop.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.836
He says...

08:55.869 --> 08:57.370
"Good morning, Eric."

08:57.404 --> 08:59.740
Whoa!

08:59.773 --> 09:02.109
He used to say that!

09:02.142 --> 09:03.510
Okay.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.445
Um, okay.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.414
(whimpers)

09:07.447 --> 09:10.117
Pop, Pop, I can't believe
it's really you.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.585
Yeah, just believe it.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.722
So, what is it you wanted
to say to me, son?

09:14.755 --> 09:16.757
Oh, crap.

09:16.790 --> 09:20.628
My mind is totally blanking
right now.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.396
It's just,
it's like calling in to WFAN,

09:23.430 --> 09:24.798
and they're like, "Uh,

09:24.832 --> 09:26.133
"uh, you're on the air
with your dead father.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.367
What's your question?"

09:27.400 --> 09:28.702
And it's like, I can't...

09:28.736 --> 09:30.704
I can't...

09:30.738 --> 09:32.239
I am sweating so bad.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.974
Oh, thank God
for the Mennen.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.743
* By Mennen.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.278
Meter's running, son.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.581
What is the one thing
you wanted to say to me?

09:41.615 --> 09:43.316
I got it.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.118
Pop...

09:45.152 --> 09:48.756
what shade of white did you want
to paint the laundry room?

09:52.325 --> 09:54.394
(sighs)
How much longer?

09:54.427 --> 09:55.562
As I said,

09:55.595 --> 09:57.597
he's in a meeting,

09:57.631 --> 09:59.166
and it will probably
be a while.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.500
STOSH:
Hey, Tony!

10:00.533 --> 10:03.170
Hi, Stosh! Hey!

10:03.203 --> 10:04.838
Listen, I'm right in
the middle of something.
I got to hit the head.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.306
I'll walk with you.
How you been?
Oh, oh.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.574
Okay, okay.
Oh, my.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.909
So here's the deal.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.444
I am leaving Sunny Smile.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.146
And word hasn't hit
the street yet,

10:13.180 --> 10:14.581
but since you and I are tight,

10:14.614 --> 10:15.783
I thought I'd come to you first.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.117
So, what do you say?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.418
You want to snap up
the competitor's

10:18.451 --> 10:20.287
top sales rep
nine years running?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.089
When do I start?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.256
Everyone knows
you got fired, Stosh.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.424
The word's out on you, man.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.359
(chuckles)
At your age,

10:26.393 --> 10:27.761
still making a sport
of sleeping

10:27.795 --> 10:29.196
with other guys' wives
and girlfriends?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.664
(chuckles)
I mean, come on, man.

10:30.698 --> 10:31.965
Well, Tony, take it easy.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.433
I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.135
No? What about last month
when you drilled

10:35.168 --> 10:36.837
Valdivia's wife dressed
as a member of Blue Man Group?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.505
What...?

10:38.538 --> 10:39.606
...about it? What about it?

10:39.639 --> 10:40.874
No one's gonna hire you, pal.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.175
It's over.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.911
(clicks tongue)
Finito.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.380
Well, apparently what happens
in Vegas

10:47.414 --> 10:50.550
does not stay in Vegas.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.063
So, Navajo and Tusk are
both solid choices...
Mm-hmm.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.332
but I think
you might be happier

11:05.365 --> 11:06.633
with Calla Lily.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.135
What do you think, Pop?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.336
ZARA:
I have always

11:09.369 --> 11:10.838
loved Calla Lily, son.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.372
You have?
Yeah.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.474
I'm learning so much
about you today, Pop.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.810
Calla Lily it is.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.078
Great choice.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.880
Okay, son.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.414
Great reconnecting with you.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.716
You take care.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.884
Wha...

11:23.917 --> 11:25.418
Pop, where you going?

11:25.452 --> 11:26.820
I have to get back.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.556
Today is actually
Dead Person's Christmas.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.424
It's starting to feel
like old times again.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.026
Why stop now?

11:33.060 --> 11:36.997
* My boy lollipop

11:37.030 --> 11:41.201
* You make my heart
go giddy up *

11:41.234 --> 11:43.636
* You are as sweet as candy

11:44.571 --> 11:46.273
* You are my sugar dandy

11:46.306 --> 11:48.408
ZARA:
Whoa... whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:48.441 --> 11:51.678
* Oh, my boy lollipop

11:51.711 --> 11:55.082
* Never, ever leave me

11:55.115 --> 11:58.618
* Because it would
grieve me... *

11:58.651 --> 12:02.055
That's my dad.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.791
WEATHERMAN:
And it's now confirmed
that Hurricane Lauren

12:03.824 --> 12:05.859
will miss
the Atlantic coast of Florida.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.527
Air traffic
will proceed normally

12:07.560 --> 12:09.096
and thousands of homes
will be spared.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.764
Ugh! Damn it.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.065
(knocking on door)

12:12.099 --> 12:14.234
What...?
You don't want people

12:14.267 --> 12:16.736
to come in, lock your door.
Have you seen the rest

12:16.770 --> 12:18.638
of my ties that Eric
brought down here?

12:18.671 --> 12:20.207
You know you don't
live here, right?
They were right here.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.042
I left 'em on the couch.
Where the hell are they?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.111
I don't know!
What is your problem?

12:24.144 --> 12:25.378
What is my problem?

12:25.412 --> 12:26.980
You want to know
what my problem is?

12:27.014 --> 12:28.148
It could not have been
a more rhetorical question.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.250
All these yahoos
in my business

12:30.283 --> 12:31.551
have turned on me.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.920
You know?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.088
Suddenly, I have a "reputation"

12:35.122 --> 12:37.925
for boning other guys'
wives and girlfriends.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.059
I can't even get a job.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.260
I thought you had a job.
I did.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.428
I got fired

12:41.461 --> 12:42.595
for boning a guy's girlfriend.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.231
But it's the hypocrisy

12:44.264 --> 12:45.598
that gets me, you know?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.000
I mean, they all do it!

12:47.034 --> 12:48.836
And if they don't do it,
they want to do it.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.103
But that's very different.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.471
It's not different at all.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.173
Uh, wanting to bone
someone's girlfriend

12:53.206 --> 12:54.674
and actually doing it
are two very different things.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.509
Why don't you audit
a Sunday School class?

12:56.543 --> 12:58.645
They'll go over
that with you.
Okay, you know what? Back off.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.181
You asked me what my problem
was, and I told you.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.682
Okay.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.117
I'm sorry you got fired

13:04.151 --> 13:05.585
for boning someone's girlfriend

13:05.618 --> 13:07.320
and I'm sorry that
you got an unfair reputation

13:07.354 --> 13:08.688
for boning people's girlfriends.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.090
Thank you.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.524
You know, if it makes
you feel any better,

13:11.558 --> 13:13.093
I had a really
crappy day, too.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.762
I asked Howard to fly
to Florida with me

13:15.795 --> 13:17.630
to lie to Grandma about getting
married and he said no.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.466
Who would say no
to something like that?

13:19.499 --> 13:20.667
Right? Ugh...

13:20.700 --> 13:22.035
Poor Nana.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.838
All she ever wanted
was to see me happy.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.807
Guess she just dreamed too big.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.043
You two are pretty close, huh?
Oh, yeah.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.045
When kids would make fun of me
about being adopted,

13:32.079 --> 13:33.546
she used to come out
in her muumuu

13:33.580 --> 13:35.048
and chuck stale bagels at 'em.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.217
Made me feel so safe.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.618
Kids are such dicks.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.552
Right?

13:39.586 --> 13:40.888
And so sticky.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.455
You know,
it makes me happy to think

13:42.489 --> 13:43.891
that someone was there,
taking care of you.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.025
You deserve it.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.326
Really?
Yeah.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.228
You do.
You're one of the good ones,

13:48.261 --> 13:50.097
Goldfarb.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.236
I have yogurt in my mouth.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.871
I know, I like it.
I like it.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.207
No...
Dude, are you serious with this?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.543
I was opening up to you.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.812
I was sharing
my feelings with you.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.314
Yeah, I thought
that part was over.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.249
I assumed the rest
was leading up to the dance.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.750
You know, the thing...
No!

14:10.783 --> 14:13.053
You know, for half a second,

14:13.086 --> 14:14.521
I thought you were someone

14:14.554 --> 14:16.056
I could actually talk to.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.324
But no.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.425
There is a reason

14:18.458 --> 14:20.060
that people don't hire you

14:20.093 --> 14:21.728
and that people come
after you with crossbows.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.063
It's because you're

14:23.096 --> 14:25.265
a selfish, crass,
womanizing pig.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.734
Womanizing pig.
Yes! Yes!

14:27.767 --> 14:29.236
And, and you are incapable

14:29.269 --> 14:30.537
of being nice to people

14:30.570 --> 14:33.006
unless there's something
in it for you.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.242
Disgusting!

14:35.275 --> 14:36.576
You know what?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.945
Have fun tomorrow
at Golden Showers.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.547
It's Golden Meadows!
Whatever.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.219
*

14:47.787 --> 14:48.922
CARYN:
Nana!

14:48.956 --> 14:51.858
Hi!
There you are,

14:51.891 --> 14:53.026
my baby girl!

14:53.060 --> 14:54.761
Come here, sweetheart!

14:54.794 --> 14:57.097
How long has it been?
A year?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.365
A year? No.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.200
No, it's been three
months, I think.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.801
Eight months, I think.
Nana, no.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.870
Four, five
months, tops.
You had the bangs.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.939
Can we just call
it six months?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.307
How are you?

15:07.340 --> 15:08.976
How could I be
but wonderful,

15:09.009 --> 15:12.645
since my darling girl
has finally found love

15:12.679 --> 15:14.948
with an appropriate man?

15:14.982 --> 15:16.649
Oh...

15:16.683 --> 15:18.986
So where is he?
Uh...

15:19.019 --> 15:20.453
(laughs)

15:20.487 --> 15:21.921
Where is he?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.958
Nana, here's
the thing...

15:24.992 --> 15:26.226
Wow!

15:26.259 --> 15:28.828
It is not easy

15:28.861 --> 15:30.663
to park in this place.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.932
Let's just hope nobody needs an
ambulance in the next half hour.

15:32.966 --> 15:33.967
(Stosh chuckles)

15:34.001 --> 15:35.335
Nana.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.237
Even more lovely
than Caryn described you.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.271
Come here.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.673
How are you?

15:40.707 --> 15:42.742
I am Howard Blatt.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.744
Or, as I like to
refer to myself,

15:44.777 --> 15:46.913
"the luckiest man in the world."

15:46.946 --> 15:50.383
So what kind of a doctor
are you?

15:51.518 --> 15:53.086
Gyno.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.989
I'm a... gyno guy.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.357
ANNOUNCER:
There's the wind-up,

15:57.390 --> 15:58.691
and there's the pitch!

15:58.725 --> 16:00.593
Strike three!

16:00.627 --> 16:03.130
And the Mets lose
another heartbreaker!
Aw...

16:03.163 --> 16:04.964
Well, want to go
stretch our legs

16:04.998 --> 16:06.633
before the second game
of the doubleheader?

16:06.666 --> 16:07.834
There's another game?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.002
Are you kidding me? No!

16:09.902 --> 16:11.671
(as Pop):
No...

16:11.704 --> 16:14.674
No, I really have
to go now, Eric.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.009
What are you talking about?

16:16.043 --> 16:17.444
We gotta paint
the laundry room tomorrow.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.180
Eric, it is not healthy
for a grown man

16:20.213 --> 16:23.150
to spend this much time
with his dead father.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.255
Yeah, I know.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.124
I've enjoyed being
with you so much,

16:31.158 --> 16:32.825
I just didn't want it to end.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.729
But you're right.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.232
It's time to say good-bye.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.501
Yes, it is, son.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.071
At least this time I actually
get to say it, though, huh?

16:45.572 --> 16:48.041
Good-bye, Pop.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.309
I love you.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.578
I love you, too.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.013
I'll always be with you.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.515
Good-bye, son.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.386
Come here... mmm!

16:59.419 --> 17:02.689
Oh, Pop, you smell
so good... mmm...

17:02.722 --> 17:04.023
Whoa, okay!

17:04.057 --> 17:06.359
Hey, okay! Zara's back!

17:06.393 --> 17:08.328
Uh, hope that helped, Eric!
I'll catch you later.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.729
Zara!

17:09.762 --> 17:10.930
You're back?

17:10.963 --> 17:12.565
If that is not
great timing!

17:12.599 --> 17:14.234
Second game
of the doubleheader's

17:14.267 --> 17:15.635
about to start.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.071
Sit down!

17:18.105 --> 17:19.439
I have had the
craziest day!

17:19.472 --> 17:20.907
(Eric laughs)

17:20.940 --> 17:22.109
You're not gonna
believe it!

17:22.142 --> 17:23.743
So, typical year,

17:23.776 --> 17:25.112
depending on how many surgeries

17:25.145 --> 17:26.879
I do, it's usually
in the, um...

17:26.913 --> 17:28.715
high sixes, low seven figures.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.417
Before taxes?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.185
Nana, come on-- after.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.721
Okay, Nana, I think that's
enough questions for now.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.189
Shut up.
I just want to know

17:36.223 --> 17:38.057
you're gonna be taken care of.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.260
Actually, Nana,
I'm kind of hoping

17:40.293 --> 17:41.461
that your granddaughter

17:41.494 --> 17:43.463
and I can help take care
of each other.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.133
She's a lousy cook,
if that's what you mean.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.435
Undeniably.
Her food is terrible.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.103
(laughs)
But, no,

17:50.137 --> 17:52.139
that's-that's not what I mean.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.406
Um...

17:53.440 --> 17:55.041
You know, since the day
Caryn and I met,

17:55.074 --> 17:58.044
it's been a...
pretty bumpy ride.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.413
You know, we're
both opinionated,

18:00.447 --> 18:03.583
stubborn,
pain-in-the-ass people.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.084
Sometimes we...

18:05.118 --> 18:08.921
we really bring out
the worst in each other.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.957
Sometimes...

18:10.990 --> 18:13.760
we really hurt
each other's feelings.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.498
It's scary, you know?

18:18.531 --> 18:21.968
When a person can somehow see
what's going on inside you.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.440
But, when things get
really rough between us,

18:27.474 --> 18:32.078
we just like
to play this song...

18:32.111 --> 18:34.947
* Darling
...be together in
the same space

18:34.981 --> 18:36.283
for a few minutes...

18:36.316 --> 18:38.785
* Oh
...and dance.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.322
* When we get married

18:42.355 --> 18:46.659
* We will have
a big celebration *

18:46.693 --> 18:51.164
* Send invitations

18:51.198 --> 18:55.435
* To all our friends
and relations *

18:55.468 --> 18:58.805
* We'll have a ball

18:58.838 --> 19:02.108
* Dancing and all

19:02.141 --> 19:06.145
* When we get married

19:09.649 --> 19:14.454
* When the bells ring

19:14.487 --> 19:17.156
* And tell the world

19:17.190 --> 19:19.792
* I'm taking your hand

19:19.826 --> 19:22.695
* Folks from all over

19:22.729 --> 19:26.833
* Will come to see
the wedding we planned *

19:26.866 --> 19:28.501
* We'll have a ball...

19:28.535 --> 19:30.337
And it's good.

19:30.370 --> 19:34.140
* Dancing and all

19:34.173 --> 19:37.710
* When we get married...

19:37.744 --> 19:38.878
Nana...

19:38.911 --> 19:40.647
what a pleasure it was
to meet you.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.849
Thank you.
(Stosh chuckles)

19:42.882 --> 19:46.018
I'll give you guys
a few minutes alone.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.255
I'll be in the hall waiting.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.559
Lovely boy.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.228
Don't screw it up.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.603
Uh...

20:03.636 --> 20:06.773
excuse me, Did you see a guy
come out of this room

20:06.806 --> 20:08.040
a couple minutes ago?

20:08.074 --> 20:10.377
Uh, yes.
He drove away.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.712
Really?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.914
(sighs)

20:17.216 --> 20:19.319
(sighs)

20:20.320 --> 20:21.754
I need to get there.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.956
Uh, yeah.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.092
Oh, oh...

20:26.125 --> 20:27.794
Hey, there.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.863
Good trip back?

20:30.897 --> 20:33.300
Yeah. Um...

20:33.333 --> 20:34.934
Actually, you tore out of there

20:34.967 --> 20:36.202
before I had a chance

20:36.235 --> 20:37.570
to thank you.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.205
It was a very kind

20:39.238 --> 20:41.474
and generous thing that you did.

20:41.508 --> 20:44.210
And I guess I had you wrong...

20:44.243 --> 20:45.478
so, I am sorry.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.779
No biggie.

20:46.813 --> 20:47.947
ERIC:
Zara?

20:47.980 --> 20:49.382
Hey, Zara, could you contact

20:49.416 --> 20:51.150
my pop one last time?

20:51.183 --> 20:53.453
I got our credit card bill.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.822
Could you just ask him if
he bought a first-class ticket

20:55.855 --> 20:57.757
to Miami?

20:57.790 --> 20:59.492
And then rented
a luxury party bus,

20:59.526 --> 21:01.561
spent $1,300 at the Kitty Cave,
bailed himself out

21:01.594 --> 21:03.563
of Broward County Jail
and then bought

21:03.596 --> 21:04.497
two gold watches?

21:04.531 --> 21:05.932
You know what, Eric?

21:05.965 --> 21:06.966
That does...

21:06.999 --> 21:08.835
that does, uh, sound like him.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.102
It's, um...

21:10.136 --> 21:12.238
You know, you're right.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.706
Classic Pop.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.808
Still living large, man!

21:15.842 --> 21:18.044
(laughing)

21:19.312 --> 21:21.948
How am I gonna pay
for this thing now...?

21:21.981 --> 21:23.550
Good night.
