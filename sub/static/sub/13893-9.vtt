00:15.885 --> 00:18.995
Dude. Quit messing around and give me a hand with these boxes.

00:18.995 --> 00:19.985
I'm busy!

00:26.935 --> 00:28.165
What? What is it?

00:29.625 --> 00:31.645
Radicola!

00:31.645 --> 00:33.745
Aw man, this stuff was the best!

00:34.665 --> 00:37.305
This is from the 1984 Olympics!

00:37.305 --> 00:39.375
Dude, let's go take these out back and drink 'em all.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.585
Come on!

00:40.585 --> 00:42.125
Skips, we have a lot-

00:42.245 --> 00:44.125
we have a lot to do. I need to be around-

00:44.125 --> 00:46.125
No, you should think it over, I'm telling you.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.585
I don't know, Skips.

00:47.585 --> 00:49.115
Seriously, Benson,

00:49.165 --> 00:50.645
you work too hard.

00:50.645 --> 00:52.065
You should take the night off.

00:52.315 --> 00:54.525
Well... if you say so.

00:54.575 --> 00:57.705
- But if anything happens- - Stop your worrying.

00:57.705 --> 01:00.765
- Everything'll be fine. - Okay.

01:00.765 --> 01:02.185
Benson gone...

01:02.185 --> 01:03.215
...plus soda...

01:03.215 --> 01:04.325
...equals

01:04.325 --> 01:06.065
Party!

01:08.185 --> 01:10.055
Him, him, her, him—

01:10.935 --> 01:12.285
Definitely invite her!

01:12.285 --> 01:13.915
Hey, jerkweeds!

01:13.925 --> 01:16.545
Get off the computer - I got sign-up time.

01:16.545 --> 01:19.015
You know how long my downloads take.

01:19.015 --> 01:21.285
We're busy inviting people to our party.

01:21.285 --> 01:23.455
What? Your parties suck!

01:23.455 --> 01:25.185
I was at the last one,

01:25.205 --> 01:27.095
and there weren't even any chicks.

01:27.095 --> 01:28.965
Yeah, well, just you wait!

01:28.965 --> 01:30.605
This party's gonna be awesome.

01:30.695 --> 01:32.015
I highly doubt it.

01:35.415 --> 01:37.765
We gonna paaaaar-ty!

01:37.765 --> 01:40.065
Got some chips, got some dips!

01:40.065 --> 01:42.775
Some call me cheap, bit of a freeloader,

01:42.775 --> 01:45.445
but I bought cups for that old-school soda!

01:45.445 --> 01:47.985
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,

01:47.995 --> 01:50.905
but here's some hummus for these mini-toasts!

01:50.905 --> 01:53.685
- Huu-mmus! - Humm-uus!

01:53.685 --> 01:57.015
- Hummus! - Why are you guys yelling hummus?

01:57.825 --> 01:59.365
Uh, no reason.

01:59.365 --> 02:00.685
Doesn't matter anyway,

02:00.685 --> 02:04.385
'coz while I'm on my night off tonight, Skips is in charge.

02:04.385 --> 02:07.955
That's right, this guy is going to be my eyes and ears.

02:12.945 --> 02:15.585
This better be some party.

02:18.495 --> 02:20.735
Man, this party is off the hook!

02:20.735 --> 02:24.555
Coz we got soda in taa house!

02:24.985 --> 02:25.825
What?

02:25.915 --> 02:27.875
1984 Olympics?

02:27.885 --> 02:29.825
Are you sure we can drink this?

02:29.825 --> 02:32.365
Sure you can! It's aged to perfection.

02:35.035 --> 02:37.855
Told you this party was going to blow!

02:38.695 --> 02:40.365
I think this is the place...

02:41.865 --> 02:44.625
Oh, sorry. We thought there was a party here.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.565
I told you, I told you!

02:49.605 --> 02:52.105
Your party is lame!

02:54.315 --> 02:56.595
Dude! This party is tanking fast!

02:56.595 --> 02:58.225
There's gotta be a way to step this up.

02:59.725 --> 03:01.975
Isn't your party tanking fast?

03:02.035 --> 03:04.295
Vell, I've got the answer!

03:06.105 --> 03:08.095
Party Pete!

03:08.415 --> 03:12.125
- Party Pete. - Awesome party, bro!

03:12.695 --> 03:15.365

03:20.585 --> 03:21.745

03:21.795 --> 03:24.095
Aw, man. We need that guy!

03:24.135 --> 03:26.365
What?! Why would you want to pay fifty dollars

03:26.385 --> 03:28.055
for some dude to come to our house?

03:28.055 --> 03:28.985
What's he even gonna do?

03:29.025 --> 03:30.735
He's just gonna come and eat all our food.

03:30.735 --> 03:31.975
Do you have a better idea?

03:32.015 --> 03:33.545
Yes, I do.

03:42.535 --> 03:44.025
Come on, Skips! Dance!

03:44.025 --> 03:45.095
Don't touch me!

03:45.095 --> 03:47.605
Oh, it hurts to listen!

03:55.405 --> 03:56.335
Hear that?

03:56.385 --> 03:59.525
That's the sound of your party failing!

03:59.525 --> 04:01.825
Dance to that, losers!

04:05.095 --> 04:06.695
Just relax, Benson.

04:06.695 --> 04:08.865
Everything's gonna be fine, Benson.

04:08.865 --> 04:10.475
Skips has got this.

04:11.655 --> 04:12.215
Yeah.

04:17.805 --> 04:19.714
You deserve this, Benson.

04:20.015 --> 04:22.235
Yes. Yes, I do.

04:22.235 --> 04:24.445
...slowly decapitates him.

04:24.695 --> 04:28.745
And that was the mating of the Toledo horsefly,

04:28.745 --> 04:30.135
narrated by me...

04:30.265 --> 04:32.075
This party's hit rock bottom, dude.

04:32.075 --> 04:33.505
Muscle Man was right.

04:33.505 --> 04:36.005
- What are you doing?! - Calling Party Pete.

04:38.775 --> 04:40.805
Mm, ja, ja, Party Pete.

04:40.805 --> 04:41.685
Party Pete?

04:41.755 --> 04:43.685
Alright, let's get outta here.

04:45.355 --> 04:46.515
Where's everybody going?

04:46.515 --> 04:49.145
We've had enough. We're gonna head out.

04:49.145 --> 04:50.345
Yeah, losers!

04:50.355 --> 04:53.485
Takes more than expired soda to have a party.

04:53.535 --> 04:56.235
It takes guests with breasts,

04:56.245 --> 04:57.695
and mine don't count.

04:57.695 --> 05:00.865
Guys, people are coming. They're just fashionably late.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.265
It's ten thirty.

05:02.305 --> 05:04.295
Nobody else is gonna come.

05:05.255 --> 05:07.705
I wonder who that could be, ha ha...

05:07.705 --> 05:10.065
- Quick, how much money you got? - Three dollars.

05:19.785 --> 05:22.585

05:23.005 --> 05:24.355
About ten minutes.

05:24.355 --> 05:27.005

05:27.005 --> 05:28.215
Okay, ve'll do it.

I knew we'd find the party!

06:41.765 --> 06:46.075

07:19.795 --> 07:22.295
Hey, wassup, Mordy and Rigby?

You remember how your toilet like used to flush,

07:25.065 --> 07:27.425

07:27.425 --> 07:29.475
Anyway, phone call for ya!

07:29.475 --> 07:31.765
Some angry dude named Benson. Later!

07:32.915 --> 07:35.715
- Hello? - Is that a party I hear?

07:35.715 --> 07:37.885
Uh, no, that's the TV.

07:38.035 --> 07:41.465
Oh, yeah? I can hear music coming from the house!

07:41.685 --> 07:44.135
I think I'm gonna come down for a little visit.

07:44.135 --> 07:45.265
See ya soon!

07:47.485 --> 07:50.725
Dude, Benson is coming. We gotta find Party Pete, fast.

07:54.315 --> 07:56.745
Party Pete! Party Pete!

08:02.775 --> 08:05.665
Ugh, Party Pete! How many of these have you had?!

08:05.865 --> 08:08.445
Seriously, man! You gotta stop!

08:13.975 --> 08:17.125
Stop? But I do not vant to.

08:29.225 --> 08:30.955
Dude, he's unstoppable!

08:30.955 --> 08:32.115
Not for long.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.505
If we give him more soda,

08:33.505 --> 08:36.554
he'll grow brighter and brighter until he exhausts all his energy.

08:36.554 --> 08:38.815
Then he'll burn out like a star!

08:38.975 --> 08:40.815
Come on. Let's do this.

08:49.825 --> 08:50.955
It's working!

08:53.355 --> 08:54.995
Quick, we need more soda!

08:54.995 --> 08:56.115
We're all out.

08:56.305 --> 08:58.305
Wait. I know where there's more soda.

08:59.535 --> 09:01.355
Alright everybody, on three.

09:01.365 --> 09:03.505
One, two, three!

09:10.775 --> 09:13.125
Dude! Party Pete's gonna blow!

09:13.275 --> 09:14.265
Hit the deck!

09:26.605 --> 09:29.415
We're dead. This place is completely trashed.

09:29.415 --> 09:31.825
We'll never get this place cleaned up before Benson comes back!

09:31.825 --> 09:33.225
It could be worse.

09:35.935 --> 09:38.865
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

09:38.865 --> 09:41.485
Yo, that party was awesome!

09:41.485 --> 09:42.855
We'll totally help you clean up.

09:42.855 --> 09:45.235
And we're here to help, too!

09:59.035 --> 10:01.245
Oh man! Benson's coming!

10:01.565 --> 10:03.175
Everybody out through the kitchen!

10:03.175 --> 10:05.175
Wicked party, duders!

10:05.175 --> 10:06.945
Capital soiree!

10:06.945 --> 10:10.895
I guess I was wrong. That party was kinda awesome.

10:10.895 --> 10:14.285
I'm gonna go collapse in my bathtub now.

10:17.845 --> 10:20.425
You guys are dead. I knew I couldn't trust yo...

10:21.345 --> 10:23.555
- What the... - Oh, hey Benson! What's up?

10:24.055 --> 10:27.145
- What are you guys doing? - We're just playing video games.

10:34.315 --> 10:36.105
You guys are clean!

10:36.205 --> 10:37.675
Sorry for doubting you.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.615
I wanna do something nice for you two.

10:43.505 --> 10:46.115
Yep, you guys of all people would appreciate this.

10:46.115 --> 10:47.715
I've been saving some soda

10:47.715 --> 10:51.035
from the 1984 Olympics for a special occasion.

10:51.035 --> 10:52.365
Uh wait what?

10:52.365 --> 10:54.945
So let's crack open some cold ones!

10:54.945 --> 10:56.735
They're up in the attic, come on!

10:58.025 --> 10:59.155
We're dead.
