00:25.567 --> 00:27.026
Shit.

00:29.028 --> 00:31.905
This is the worst.
This is the worst.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.824
Doing a documentary
on my scandal.

00:37.158 --> 00:39.034
Hi.

00:40.035 --> 00:40.952
I don't know.

00:41.035 --> 00:42.703
I guess the

00:42.786 --> 00:46.080
the punch line
is... is true about me.

00:46.163 --> 00:48.206
I did the things.

00:48.289 --> 00:50.291
Um, but I did a lot
of other things too.

01:02.207 --> 01:03.487
Mr. Speaker,
I yield one minute

01:03.512 --> 01:04.513
to the distinguished gentleman

01:04.596 --> 01:06.472
from New York, Mr. Weiner.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.517
Gentleman's...

01:10.600 --> 01:11.934
Great courage to wait

01:12.017 --> 01:13.727
until all members
have already spoken

01:13.810 --> 01:16.187
and then stand up and wrap
your arms around procedure.

01:16.270 --> 01:18.522
You vote yes if you believe yes!

01:18.605 --> 01:19.981
You vote in favor of something

01:20.064 --> 01:21.482
if you believe
it's the right thing.

01:21.565 --> 01:23.525
If you believe it's the wrong
thing, you vote no.

01:23.608 --> 01:25.401
We are following a procedure.

01:25.484 --> 01:27.194
I will not yield
to the gentleman

01:27.277 --> 01:29.445
and the gentleman will observe
regular order.

01:29.528 --> 01:31.238
The gentleman will observe
regular order.

01:31.321 --> 01:32.905
Not in order.

01:32.988 --> 01:35.532
It's Republicans wrapping
their arms around Republicans

01:35.615 --> 01:38.200
rather than doing the right
thing on behalf of the heroes.

01:38.283 --> 01:41.536
It is a shame! A shame!

01:41.619 --> 01:45.039
If you believe this is a bad
idea to provide healthcare

01:45.122 --> 01:46.123
then vote no!

01:46.206 --> 01:48.750
But don't give me
the cowardly view

01:48.833 --> 01:51.126
that, "Oh, if it was
a different procedure."

01:51.209 --> 01:54.420
The gentleman will observe
regular order and sit down!

01:54.503 --> 01:56.046
I will not.

01:56.129 --> 01:58.714
It's about damn time.

01:58.797 --> 02:02.175
It was an absolute pleasure
to see a Democrat not cowering.

02:05.011 --> 02:06.429
Is it not the rules of the house

02:06.512 --> 02:09.723
that under clause 10A of rule 21

02:09.806 --> 02:12.433
what the speaker articulated
in this sentence

02:12.516 --> 02:14.100
is in the fact the rule?

02:14.183 --> 02:15.893
The gentleman is untimely.

02:15.976 --> 02:17.644
Engrossment and third reading
of the bill.

02:17.727 --> 02:21.063
Those in favor will signify
by saying, aye.

02:21.146 --> 02:24.065
No question the guy knows
how to fight.

02:24.148 --> 02:25.149
He's scrappy, he's combative

02:25.232 --> 02:27.901
he's always been a great fighter
on behalf of the people.

02:27.984 --> 02:29.986
He never backed down
from anybody.

02:30.069 --> 02:31.390
You should urge them to vote yes

02:31.403 --> 02:35.949
something the gentleman
has not done!

02:36.032 --> 02:38.112
You're scaring the hell out
of people in the right.

02:40.452 --> 02:44.205
That's the sum and substance
of ObamaCare. That's your idea.

02:44.288 --> 02:47.082
Why don't you like it,
now that we wrote the law?

02:50.794 --> 02:53.171
I got 94 percent of my college.
What percent did you get?

02:53.254 --> 02:54.964
How did that
whip organization go?

02:55.047 --> 02:56.173
How's that crackerjack

02:56.256 --> 02:58.758
Peter King whip organization
working out?

02:58.841 --> 03:01.093
Stop whining
and get the bill passed.

03:01.176 --> 03:02.093
Boy, that was passionate.

03:02.176 --> 03:04.261
I... I'm glad somebody's finally

03:04.344 --> 03:06.704
put their foot down and says,
"We're not taking it anymore."

03:07.638 --> 03:09.723
Weiner is a rising star
in Congress.

03:09.806 --> 03:12.308
Married to one of Hillary Clinton's
closest advisors.

03:12.391 --> 03:14.267
Bill Clinton officiated
their wedding.

03:14.350 --> 03:17.144
Ladies and gentlemen,
the honorable Anthony Weiner.

03:26.278 --> 03:28.363
We turn now to Washington
where trouble is brewing

03:28.446 --> 03:30.114
for a high-profile
New York Congressman.

03:30.197 --> 03:33.116
It all started Friday night
at 11:30 p.m.

03:33.199 --> 03:35.951
A photo of an anonymous man's
bulging underwear...

03:36.034 --> 03:38.327
Was Tweeted from
Congressman Weiner's account.

03:38.410 --> 03:41.121
Tell me definitely,
is that a photograph of you?

03:41.204 --> 03:42.538
I'm reluctant to say to you

03:42.621 --> 03:44.080
definitively anything
about this.

03:44.163 --> 03:45.622
So it's possible it is you.

03:45.705 --> 03:47.081
We're trying to get
to the bottom of what

03:47.164 --> 03:48.373
it's of and who it's of.

03:48.456 --> 03:50.576
Have you ever taken a picture
like this of yourself?

03:50.582 --> 03:52.292
I have photographs.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.918
I don't know what photographs
are out there

03:54.001 --> 03:55.043
in the world of me.

03:55.126 --> 03:56.168
I don't know
what things have been

03:56.251 --> 03:58.086
manipulated and doctored.

03:58.169 --> 04:01.172
You would know if Th... this
is your underpants.

04:04.383 --> 04:08.220
At an emergency press conference,
the truth came out.

04:08.303 --> 04:10.179
Like a..

04:11.430 --> 04:15.142
Like a dolphin wiggling free
of a blanket.

04:15.225 --> 04:18.144
To be clear, the picture
was of me and I sent it.

04:18.226 --> 04:20.228
Please welcome Congressman
Weiner's underwear.

04:22.814 --> 04:24.440
Now, I'm not happy about it

04:24.523 --> 04:27.234
but anytime
a new Weiner photo comes out

04:27.317 --> 04:29.861
as a television host,
I am constitutionally obliged

04:29.944 --> 04:31.445
to show them to you.

04:31.528 --> 04:33.279
I took an oath.

04:33.362 --> 04:36.406
He first and foremost
apologizes to his wife Huma.

04:36.489 --> 04:39.241
She's pregnant
with their first child.

04:39.324 --> 04:40.992
I am deeply regretting
what I have done

04:41.075 --> 04:43.660
and I am not resigning.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.913
If it was me, I would resign.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.167
Today I'm announcing
my resignation from Congress.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.376
Yeah!

04:54.459 --> 04:56.294
Bye... bye, pervert!

05:02.215 --> 05:05.176
Okay. Okay. Okay. Ready?

05:05.259 --> 05:08.220
Here... Ready? Get on here,
and Daddy's gonna pick you up.

05:08.303 --> 05:10.638
Whoa!

05:10.721 --> 05:12.305
Whoa.

05:12.388 --> 05:14.223
And... down.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.685
Was there a moment when you
realized "I have to lie about this?"

05:18.935 --> 05:23.272
Oh, almost immediately, I
was like, I gotta, I mean, yes.

05:23.355 --> 05:24.689
I was in a, yeah, of...

05:24.772 --> 05:26.482
I mean, if...

05:26.565 --> 05:28.608
So, I mean, yes.

05:28.691 --> 05:32.277
But yeah, I... I knew instantly
it was... it was pretty bad.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.236
What was Huma's reaction
when you told her?

05:34.319 --> 05:36.029
Her, told her the truth?

05:36.112 --> 05:37.404
Told her what happened, yeah.

05:37.487 --> 05:39.363
Told her the truth or told her

05:39.547 --> 05:41.298
you know, something's
going down here?

05:41.381 --> 05:42.965
Well, walk me
through it. So...

05:43.048 --> 05:44.007
I don't remember.

05:44.090 --> 05:45.508
I... I think that...

05:45.591 --> 05:46.508
I mean, there was a period
of time

05:46.591 --> 05:47.800
that I mean, I lied to her.

05:47.883 --> 05:49.301
I mean, I lied to her too.

05:49.384 --> 05:51.427
I didn't like, fess up to her
and then lie to the world.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.261
I was try... The primary person,
I was trying to protect

05:53.344 --> 05:55.304
finding out about this was Huma.

05:57.681 --> 05:59.516
And so, I think I was hacked.

05:59.599 --> 06:01.392
I think, you know, whatever
it is, I don't... I don't

06:01.475 --> 06:03.560
I mean, the same stories
I was telling, I was...

06:03.643 --> 06:06.437
It started out
as my... my telling her.

06:09.189 --> 06:12.483
Did Huma want you
to get back into politics?

06:12.566 --> 06:14.776
Well, she did.

06:14.859 --> 06:16.318
Uh, she did.

06:17.569 --> 06:21.906
She was very eager
to get her life... back

06:21.989 --> 06:23.365
that I had taken from her.

06:23.448 --> 06:25.324
To clean up the mess
that I had made.

06:25.407 --> 06:28.535
Running for mayor was
the straightest line to do it.

06:56.395 --> 06:58.772
Former Congressman
Anthony Weiner made it official.

06:58.855 --> 07:00.731
He is going to run for mayor.

07:00.814 --> 07:03.358
He made his announcement
on the web.

07:05.485 --> 07:07.570
Every day starts right here.

07:07.653 --> 07:09.071
Honey, I gotta go.

07:09.154 --> 07:11.322
And it's the best part
of my day.

07:13.449 --> 07:15.784
Last time Anthony Weiner
made waves on the internet

07:15.867 --> 07:18.035
it ended his career in Congress.

07:18.118 --> 07:20.495
This morning, he's out with
a highly choreographed video

07:20.578 --> 07:22.413
announcing he will be
a candidate

07:22.496 --> 07:24.873
for the 2013 mayor's race
here in New York.

07:24.956 --> 07:26.540
Look, I've made
some big mistakes

07:26.623 --> 07:28.750
and I know I let a lot
of people down.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.434
But I've also learned
some tough lessons.

07:30.459 --> 07:31.793
I'm running for mayor
'cause I've been

07:31.876 --> 07:33.036
fighting for the middle class

07:33.085 --> 07:35.253
and those struggling to make it
my entire life.

07:35.336 --> 07:37.546
And I hope I get a second chance
to work for you.

07:45.427 --> 07:46.469
New York City should be

07:46.552 --> 07:48.303
the middle class capital
of the world

07:48.386 --> 07:50.096
and I've got some ideas
on how to do it.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.389
Sixty four of them,
right on my website.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.474
Take a look,
tell me what you think.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.600
We love this city
and no one will work harder

07:56.683 --> 07:58.059
to make it better than Anthony.

07:58.142 --> 08:00.769
I will fight for you
every single day.

08:00.852 --> 08:02.270
Thank you for watching.

08:02.353 --> 08:03.896
Why are they filming you?

08:03.979 --> 08:05.271
I can't... I don't know.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.898
Most of the time I don't know
why they're filming me.

08:07.981 --> 08:09.565
Are you somebody
I'm supposed to know?

08:09.648 --> 08:10.815
Believe me, no.

08:10.898 --> 08:12.649
He's Anthony Weiner.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.319
Oh yeah. It is, isn't it?

08:19.530 --> 08:21.198
Is it Anthony Weiner?

08:37.505 --> 08:40.049
Why do you think you deserve
this second chance?

08:40.131 --> 08:41.924
Okay, it's up,
in the final analysis

08:42.008 --> 08:44.301
it's up to the voters
to make that determination.

08:44.384 --> 08:47.261
And all I'm saying is
here's some ideas that I have

08:47.344 --> 08:49.596
and at the end of the day, it's
not up to me, it's not up to you

08:49.679 --> 08:51.347
it's up to the voters,
and that's all I'm asking.

08:51.430 --> 08:54.099
Former member of Congress
Anthony Weiner has decided

08:54.182 --> 08:57.351
he will be a candidate
for the 2013 mayor's race.

08:57.434 --> 08:58.476
Welcome back, Anthony Weiner!

08:58.559 --> 09:00.435
I think people ought to show
shame in public life.

09:00.518 --> 09:02.603
When they do something
really wrong like this

09:02.686 --> 09:04.437
they should get out of action
for a while.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.689
We don't want perverts
elected in New York City.

09:07.772 --> 09:08.689
No perverts.

09:08.772 --> 09:10.440
Please step back, please.

09:10.523 --> 09:13.817
Weiner's staffers had to do
crowd control with the press.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.902
A problem the other candidates
dream of having

09:15.985 --> 09:17.653
at their news conferences.

09:17.736 --> 09:19.612
He's not a likeable guy,
and I think the question is

09:19.695 --> 09:21.363
do New Yorkers
want a punch line as mayor?

09:21.446 --> 09:24.240
If we elect this loser

09:24.323 --> 09:25.449
to any office

09:25.532 --> 09:27.659
from mayor to dog catcher

09:27.742 --> 09:29.702
then we get the government
we deserve.

09:29.785 --> 09:31.536
Man, they all full of shit.

09:31.619 --> 09:34.038
Weiner, you got
my vote, brother!

09:45.424 --> 09:49.594
Um, just so you know,
I turned down Andrea Peyser.

09:51.137 --> 09:53.556
Siphen asked if she could
sit in and I said no.

09:56.516 --> 10:00.061
Well, I... I... Well, why?

10:00.144 --> 10:02.437
Because I don't think
that she's a real reporter.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.647
Let her get it
out of her system.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.064
Okay.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.314
Hi, Andrea.

10:07.397 --> 10:09.607
- Hey, how are ya?
- Good, thank you.

10:09.690 --> 10:11.316
So, first question
I'm gonna ask you is

10:11.399 --> 10:14.610
what was your favorite
"Post" headline?

10:14.693 --> 10:17.278
I... I don't read
the "New York Post."

10:17.361 --> 10:18.570
You don't?

10:18.653 --> 10:21.697
Alright, um, so how many women

10:21.780 --> 10:25.408
were involved in the sexting,
the, uh, texting?

10:25.491 --> 10:28.160
You know, I did some very
regrettable things

10:28.243 --> 10:30.536
over an extended period of time

10:30.619 --> 10:32.162
with more than one person.

10:32.245 --> 10:33.496
You did some very what?
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

10:33.579 --> 10:37.708
Very, very regrettable things
that I have apologized for

10:37.791 --> 10:39.584
and I'm gonna be spending
a lot of time, I think

10:39.667 --> 10:41.669
on the campaign trail
apologizing for.

10:41.752 --> 10:43.545
Okay, so why... why

10:43.628 --> 10:46.464
are you hiding today?

10:46.547 --> 10:49.424
I... I'm having conversations
on the telephone.

10:49.507 --> 10:51.425
What do you mean hiding, Andrea?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.985
Hi, Michael,
it's Barbara Morgan.

10:53.068 --> 10:55.695
Hi, Andrew, it's Barbara Morgan.
Hi, Azzi, it's Barbara Morgan.

10:55.778 --> 10:57.029
I'm gonna put you
on speaker now, okay?

10:57.112 --> 10:58.446
Hi, Michael. Hi, Jill.

10:58.529 --> 10:59.569
Hi, Jennifer, how are you?

10:59.613 --> 11:02.532
How do we know that this
behavior is over?

11:02.615 --> 11:04.283
You put Huma and Jordan
in the video.

11:04.366 --> 11:05.617
Why was that decision made?

11:05.700 --> 11:07.201
Your brother said
that your father

11:07.284 --> 11:08.868
never hugged you.

11:08.951 --> 11:10.535
Huma and I looked at one
and another and said

11:10.618 --> 11:11.869
"You know, we don't
wanna be living

11:11.952 --> 11:13.787
in a defensive crouch anymore."

11:13.870 --> 11:14.991
Families get through things.

11:14.995 --> 11:18.707
I don't begrudge citizens
wanting to ask me

11:18.790 --> 11:19.832
about the mistakes
that I've made

11:19.915 --> 11:21.583
but what I'm gonna try
to talk about

11:21.666 --> 11:23.709
is the issues facing
New York City

11:23.792 --> 11:25.835
the middle class and people
struggling to make it.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.712
Every dollar available
for salaries

11:28.795 --> 11:30.546
is being eaten up
by healthcare costs.

11:30.629 --> 11:32.839
There are good bike lanes
and there are bad bike lanes.

11:32.922 --> 11:34.715
The controversy
over Stop-and-Frisk

11:34.798 --> 11:36.633
has been over
how it's been used.

11:36.716 --> 11:38.217
- I don't think anyone...
- Wait, wait, wait.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.886
Uh... are more women

11:41.969 --> 11:43.095
going to come forward?

11:43.178 --> 11:44.637
Do we have more
to look forward to?

11:44.720 --> 11:47.431
There was some talk of going
away to a rehab program...

11:47.514 --> 11:52.310
What does what happened there say about
your fitness to run New York City?

12:00.735 --> 12:04.029
"The saga of, of the
transgressions of Anthony Weiner

12:04.112 --> 12:06.864

13:09.865 --> 13:11.575
Yeah.

Alright, let me get
Huma up here.

15:11.113 --> 15:12.781
I wanna get her started.
No, I really enjoyed it.

15:12.864 --> 15:14.740
I really enjoyed it.

15:18.340 --> 15:20.260
Those of you who know me
are probably surprised

15:20.285 --> 15:22.161
to see me standing up here.

I'm usually back in the room

15:24.537 --> 15:27.373
far away from the microphone
as possible.

15:27.456 --> 15:29.166
I'm doing it because

15:29.249 --> 15:30.875
I love my city

15:30.958 --> 15:33.961
and I believe in my husband.

15:34.044 --> 15:35.670
Launching this campaign

15:35.753 --> 15:38.797
was not an easy decision
for my family to make.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.882
People say a lot of things
about my husband.

15:40.965 --> 15:44.819
Some nice, some not so nice.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.571
Putting yourself
out there is hard.

15:47.654 --> 15:49.989
Our challenges,
what we went through

15:50.072 --> 15:51.907
it's nothing compared
to what so many families

15:51.990 --> 15:53.366
in this city face every day.

15:53.824 --> 15:55.617
No one fights harder
on behalf of people.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.911
And no one will make New York
safer, stronger, more secure...

15:58.994 --> 16:00.912
than my husband, Anthony.

16:00.995 --> 16:02.162
Oh!

16:07.166 --> 16:09.126
Oh my god, that..

16:09.209 --> 16:10.335
That was remarkable.

16:10.418 --> 16:13.963
I feel what people
must have felt like..

16:14.046 --> 16:16.840
Seeing Charlie Chaplain in
the talkies for the first time.

16:16.923 --> 16:17.924
Like, "That's what
she sounds like."

16:19.633 --> 16:21.593
This is kind of our first
campaign together.

16:21.676 --> 16:24.970
The city is getting to know her
a bit and one thing is clear

16:25.053 --> 16:27.972
if she were the candidate,
I'd be getting crushed.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.973
Yeah.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.725
I mean, man,
if there was ever anyone

16:32.808 --> 16:34.893
like, if you in fact actually
just closed your eyes

16:34.976 --> 16:37.186
and just imagined what would be
the ideal first lady

16:37.269 --> 16:38.895
for the City of New York?

16:38.978 --> 16:41.230
Someone who's graceful,
someone's who's interesting

16:41.313 --> 16:44.190
someone who's got ideas,
someone who's got experience.

16:44.273 --> 16:45.774
You know,
someone who's glamorous

16:45.857 --> 16:47.108
someone who's an amazing mom

16:47.191 --> 16:48.901
you know, someone
who's just amazing.

16:48.984 --> 16:51.653
She's the right hand woman
of Hillary Clinton

16:51.736 --> 16:54.905
known by just one name
in Washington, Huma.

16:54.988 --> 16:57.740
She was by Clinton's side
during her years in the Senate

16:57.823 --> 16:59.157
on the Presidential
campaign trail

16:59.240 --> 17:01.367
and at the State Department.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.827
At a pre-wedding celebration
for Abedin and Weiner

17:03.910 --> 17:05.953
Clinton said
"I have one daughter

17:06.036 --> 17:09.455
but if I had a second daughter,
it would be Huma."

17:11.214 --> 17:12.973
She really stayed quiet
during the scandal.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.960
Why does she wanna be out
in the spotlight now?

17:16.042 --> 17:19.046
She wants to see her husband
no longer be a social pariah.

17:19.128 --> 17:22.214
And she brings a tremendous
amount of influence.

17:22.298 --> 17:24.049
We've actually talked to folks

17:24.132 --> 17:26.092
campaign staff
who don't really much

17:26.175 --> 17:27.467
necessarily wanna work
for Anthony Weiner

17:27.550 --> 17:30.344
but they're very intrigued
about the proximity

17:30.427 --> 17:32.595
to Huma Abedin
given that she's likely

17:32.678 --> 17:33.762
to be an influential figure

17:33.845 --> 17:36.097
in an upcoming
Presidential campaign.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.431
Oh, for of course

17:37.514 --> 17:39.933
Hillary Rodham Clinton
if she runs.

17:40.016 --> 17:42.018
Have a great Fourth,
give my love to Jen

17:42.101 --> 17:43.352
and I'll talk to you soon.

17:43.435 --> 17:45.395
And thanks for the advice.

17:45.478 --> 17:48.022
Alright, take care. Bye-bye.

17:48.105 --> 17:49.481
Okay.

17:50.023 --> 17:51.903
He does not feel comfortable
writing you a check

17:51.941 --> 17:54.151
because he's on John Lius'
finance committee.

17:54.860 --> 17:55.944
This is your A-list?

17:56.027 --> 17:57.361
I'm not gonna do these
if you're gonna make

17:57.444 --> 17:59.612
this so unpleasant, okay?

17:59.695 --> 18:02.030
I hate asking people for things.
I'm asking people, okay?

18:02.113 --> 18:03.072
Okay.

18:03.155 --> 18:04.656
Why don't you do this.

18:04.739 --> 18:07.950
"Tony, I got my husband here...
It's Arnie."

18:08.033 --> 18:10.201
Arnie, I got my husband here

18:10.284 --> 18:12.577
who... who's raising money
for... for mayor.

18:12.660 --> 18:14.119
"Can I put him on with you?"

18:14.202 --> 18:15.283
- No.
- And then you're off.

18:15.286 --> 18:16.966
No, I think you get him
and then say Huma

18:17.037 --> 18:18.163
she wants to talk to you.

18:18.246 --> 18:19.497
Done. Done and done.
Here, give me that.

18:19.580 --> 18:21.081
I'll... I'll close the deal.

18:21.164 --> 18:22.790
It's Huma.

18:22.873 --> 18:26.209
How could you tell my voice?
I didn't talk to you in a year.

18:26.292 --> 18:28.919
How was the engagement?
I want all the details.

18:30.170 --> 18:33.840
Aw. What a perfect engagement.

18:33.923 --> 18:35.674
Well, that's... Well,
congratulations.

18:35.757 --> 18:39.051
Well, he's working very hard.

18:39.134 --> 18:40.844
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

18:40.927 --> 18:44.221
Have a nice,
have a nice weekend. Bye-bye.

18:44.304 --> 18:47.223
Alright, he'll max.
His wife is gonna max out.

18:47.306 --> 18:49.057
And he'll try
to raise another five.

18:49.140 --> 18:50.141
He's like, "You know,
I've never given

18:50.224 --> 18:51.642
or raised once in my life."

18:51.725 --> 18:53.101
- And...
- No kidding?

18:53.184 --> 18:55.227
Hey, Joe, it's Anthony Weiner
calling.

18:55.310 --> 18:56.790
- It's Huma.
- Anthony Weiner calling.

18:56.811 --> 18:59.730
- Hello, Joe?
- How are you, my brother?

18:59.813 --> 19:01.654
That's true.
We have a long history together.

19:01.731 --> 19:03.491
How's things at the shop?
How's the family?

19:03.524 --> 19:05.108
Oh, really?

19:05.191 --> 19:06.859
Hey, Mike, I was wondering if...

19:06.942 --> 19:08.485
If you call your friends
and they're

19:08.568 --> 19:10.194
you know, they're willing
to write checks...

19:10.277 --> 19:11.987
I haven't asked you
for two years.

19:12.070 --> 19:13.696
I've given you
a nice long break.

19:13.779 --> 19:15.179
You're the leader
in the community

19:15.196 --> 19:16.697
so they're gonna listen to you.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.532
Four thousand nine hundred
and fifty per person

19:19.615 --> 19:22.826
and 9,900 per couple.

19:22.909 --> 19:24.035
That's nice of you to say.

19:24.118 --> 19:26.161
Now, are you is the 20 gonna be
in on Monday

19:26.244 --> 19:27.828
when you... you're gonna
bring it with you?

19:27.911 --> 19:30.496
It makes me feel very awkward
about this one too, but...

19:30.579 --> 19:32.956
- Are you married?
- You're a good friend.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.750
- Good to hear your voice.
- Two hundred and fifty.

19:35.833 --> 19:39.211
Five thousand in five minutes.
That's not bad. You did well.

19:39.294 --> 19:40.253
Bye, bye, bye.

19:40.336 --> 19:42.087
See ya.
Thanks for everything.

19:42.170 --> 19:44.922
Thanks, guys. Happy Fourth.

19:45.005 --> 19:46.131
Hey, Marie. Thanks
for everything, guys.

19:46.214 --> 19:47.757
Is he gonna get on the ballot?

19:47.840 --> 19:49.216
He's going to get on the ballot.

19:49.299 --> 19:50.133
- Yes?
- Yes.

19:50.216 --> 19:52.635
Do we need to worry
about this? Are we okay?

19:53.636 --> 19:55.095
Hold this, babe.

19:55.178 --> 19:57.054
Oh, this is pretty exciting.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.322
It is.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.031
I'm a signer.

20:00.531 --> 20:02.866
Huma is that the first petition
you've ever signed?

20:02.949 --> 20:04.450
- I, yeah, it is.
- Yes.

20:04.533 --> 20:07.035
Ever. It's pretty cool, huh?

20:07.118 --> 20:09.620
I need a book. Like a prep book.

20:10.823 --> 20:12.263
Just something,
I need... I need some

20:12.288 --> 20:13.872
I need, like, I have nothing.

20:13.955 --> 20:16.165
Just like a novel
or something that you could...

20:16.248 --> 20:17.624
No, but just something.

20:17.707 --> 20:19.208
Don't you remember in my event
last week, the woman was like

20:19.291 --> 20:21.001
"What's his position?" I'm like,
"I don't know what the hell

20:21.084 --> 20:22.376
his position is on X.

20:22.459 --> 20:23.543
Ask him."

20:23.626 --> 20:25.386
There's a campaign going on
all around you.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.337
I mean, you heard me
on Brian Lehrer this morning.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.673
No I didn't. I didn't know
you were on, actually.

20:31.756 --> 20:33.382
Okay, look.

20:36.176 --> 20:38.261
- I will see you on Monday.
- Thank you.

20:40.429 --> 20:42.973
I'm not crazy about those pants.

20:43.056 --> 20:46.684
Yeah, we all have
our... things to bear.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.435
Do you like 'em?

20:48.518 --> 20:51.229
They're lightweight.
I need lightweight trousers.

20:52.230 --> 20:54.106
Yes you do.

20:55.941 --> 20:58.485
Have you guys gotten any, like,
flack for working for Weiner

20:58.568 --> 21:00.027
from people who don't like him?

21:00.110 --> 21:01.152
What's the worst thing
that anyone ever said

21:01.235 --> 21:03.195
to you on the phone?

21:03.278 --> 21:05.405
"Fuck you", really.
That's pretty much it.

21:05.488 --> 21:07.323
How can you work for him?
Like, you're a woman.

21:07.406 --> 21:09.241
You should be... you should be,
you know.

21:09.324 --> 21:10.450
And I'd be like,
"Well, you know what?"

21:10.533 --> 21:12.701
"He's fought for my community

21:12.784 --> 21:15.369
"for a very long time and

21:15.452 --> 21:17.203
"you know, if Huma
can forgive Anthony

21:17.286 --> 21:19.454
then why can't a voter
forgive Anthony?"

21:19.537 --> 21:22.373
My mom at first was actually
really opposed to it.

21:22.456 --> 21:24.166
She said, "Oh, no, you can't
work for him."

21:24.249 --> 21:26.209
"You can't work for him.
That's awful.

21:26.292 --> 21:28.294
It's awful what he did."

21:28.377 --> 21:29.920
I tried making the reference
to like Bill Clinton.

21:30.003 --> 21:31.254
And then she said,
"No, Bill's different."

21:31.337 --> 21:33.714
I believe in Anthony and..

21:33.797 --> 21:37.342
Some people don't,
but a lot of people do.

21:37.425 --> 21:40.136
I really love his stances
on education

21:40.219 --> 21:42.221
his single parent
healthcare system and

21:42.304 --> 21:45.598
and I was really, really upset
when he resigned.

21:45.681 --> 21:48.016
When he talks, when he,
you know, when he's out there

21:48.099 --> 21:50.226
when he's talking about his plan
and his ideas

21:50.309 --> 21:52.394
he's just so much better.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.232
Do you think the Bill Fairy
pays for that?

21:57.315 --> 22:00.151
We all pay for that
in higher taxes.

22:00.234 --> 22:02.236
Providing Medicare
for all Americans

22:02.319 --> 22:03.278
for all New Yorkers

22:03.361 --> 22:05.863
for all people in this country,
saves us money

22:05.946 --> 22:08.281
and it's the humane,
decent thing to do.

22:14.744 --> 22:16.245
George McDonald.

22:16.328 --> 22:18.913
I want to say one thing
about American values.

22:18.996 --> 22:21.498
I would contrast my values

22:21.581 --> 22:23.499
with Anthony Weiner's values

22:23.582 --> 22:25.250
any day of the week!

22:25.333 --> 22:27.168
Seven days a week!

22:27.251 --> 22:28.961
Oh, what? You can boo.

22:29.044 --> 22:31.504
Listen, ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen

22:31.587 --> 22:33.547
ladies and gentlemen, the...

22:36.216 --> 22:39.219
Look, look, listen, listen...

22:39.302 --> 22:41.512
Okay, you don't wanna
allow me to talk

22:41.595 --> 22:45.932
that's just more time
for this glib narcissist.

22:57.441 --> 22:58.900
Let's hear it for Gay Pride!

23:03.445 --> 23:05.613
God bless America!

23:14.622 --> 23:16.502
People are less likely to go
to a cop with a tip

23:16.581 --> 23:18.742
if they think they're gonna be
frisked when they do it.

23:22.294 --> 23:24.796
I want him to win so bad.
He's the best.

23:26.339 --> 23:28.507
This does not need
a new government agency.

23:28.590 --> 23:31.050
This needs a change of policy
at the top.

23:37.556 --> 23:39.391
Alright, let's go!

23:44.395 --> 23:48.190
Weiner! Weiner! Weiner!
Weiner! Weiner!

24:03.412 --> 24:04.955
Tony Weiner lied.

24:05.038 --> 24:08.416
He lied about his texting
scandal on CNN.

24:08.499 --> 24:09.708
Whatever you think...

24:14.628 --> 24:16.546
You can rest assured
that at night...

24:16.629 --> 24:19.423
I certainly will not be
taking pictures of myself.

24:19.506 --> 24:21.424
Thank you very much.

24:30.391 --> 24:32.434
I said keep your hands
to yourself.

24:32.517 --> 24:33.351
I heard what you said.

24:33.434 --> 24:35.436
Don't put your hands
on me ever again.

24:35.519 --> 24:37.562
Really? And what's gonna happen
if I do?

24:37.645 --> 24:39.063
- You're a tough guy now?
- Yeah.

24:39.146 --> 24:41.648
- Oh, are you now?
- I am. I can defend myself.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.315
You can? You can? Okay, good.

24:43.398 --> 24:44.732
Maybe get your anger issues
under control.

24:44.815 --> 24:46.015
I don't have any anger issues.

24:46.024 --> 24:48.234
I think you do, grandpa.

24:56.282 --> 24:57.883
Let's do this again.
Let's do this again.

24:57.908 --> 24:59.492
Before you go can you assure us

24:59.575 --> 25:01.076
that you're gonna stay
in the race?

25:01.159 --> 25:03.786
That even if the going
gets really, really tough

25:03.869 --> 25:06.454
which it will be nationally,
possibly internationally.

25:06.537 --> 25:08.163
I don't want to support someone

25:08.246 --> 25:09.446
who's going to later drop out.

25:09.496 --> 25:12.332
I'm not gonna stop doing it
because I wanna make sure

25:12.415 --> 25:15.459
that my son grows up
in this great city

25:15.542 --> 25:16.876
and be able to stand
on a street corner

25:16.959 --> 25:18.168
and yell at his future mayor.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.419
Thank you very much.
If you mean that.

25:20.603 --> 25:21.770
That's a good man,
a good politician.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.646
- Thank you.
- I support Anthony Weiner.

25:23.729 --> 25:25.856
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

25:25.939 --> 25:27.899
Give 'em hell!
Keep talking issues.

25:27.982 --> 25:29.543
- Good luck, Mr. Weiner.
- Great speech.

25:29.608 --> 25:30.567
Thank you. I appreciate it.

25:30.650 --> 25:32.151
- I think you can do it.
- Thank you.

26:01.805 --> 26:02.764
Not bad, huh, bro?

26:13.691 --> 26:15.192
Huh, I might have successfully

26:15.275 --> 26:16.985
whistled past
the graveyard here.

26:17.068 --> 26:19.320
And I'm back to doing
what I wanted to do.

26:19.403 --> 26:21.613
And I always thought
I'd be a good candidate

26:21.696 --> 26:24.573
and I always thought
I'd make a good mayor.

26:24.656 --> 26:26.366
I remember once saying to Huma,
you know, it looks like

26:26.449 --> 26:27.533
you know, that we're back.

26:27.616 --> 26:29.534
We're back. It's back. You know?

26:29.617 --> 26:32.036
How... how much,
how much sodium?

26:32.119 --> 26:34.246
Six hundred
and fifty eight milligrams.

26:34.329 --> 26:37.749
This is 340.
Hold on a second. Saturated fat?

26:37.832 --> 26:39.625
- Point seven.
- Five.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.626
Okay. Italian chopped
tomatoes.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.335
Imported
Italian tomatoes. Next?

26:43.418 --> 26:46.754
- Olive oil.
- Imported olive oil. Next?

26:46.837 --> 26:48.213
Sugar.

26:48.296 --> 26:49.922
Well, you went on and on
about having no sugar in this.

26:50.005 --> 26:50.964
Sugar.

26:51.047 --> 26:53.716
We don't have any sugar in here.

26:53.799 --> 26:56.968
And we're back to being treated
like candidates, you know?

26:57.051 --> 26:59.970
I went through that bad thing
and now I'm, and now I'm back.

27:00.053 --> 27:04.140
Not, I mean, with a completely
different identity.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.433
And I'm getting all this
attention which wasn't, again

27:06.516 --> 27:08.601
wasn't a terribly comfortable
place, but yeah.

27:08.684 --> 27:10.602
I thought
it was going pretty well.

27:14.462 --> 27:16.582
Are we going to see more of you
on the campaign trail?

27:16.607 --> 27:18.609
I'm trying to figure out...
I'm a mom.

27:18.692 --> 27:21.611
I've got my own life.
And I've got my husband.

27:22.111 --> 27:24.655
I'm very proud of what he's doing.
So yeah, I want to help him.

27:24.738 --> 27:26.865
How's your first day on
the campaign trail with Huma?

27:27.365 --> 27:29.784
Well, she doesn't
consider it a date.

27:36.498 --> 27:37.749
Alright, there you go.

27:37.832 --> 27:39.512
- This is my wife, Huma.
- I know Huma too.

27:39.583 --> 27:42.919
I wanna thank you for your loyal
service to Hillary. 2016.

27:48.048 --> 27:49.649
We went out campaigning
a couple times.

27:49.674 --> 27:52.009
She had a ball doing it.

27:52.092 --> 27:54.594
We had kinda been living
in this defensive crouch

27:54.677 --> 27:56.303
for a very long time..

27:56.386 --> 27:58.805
And getting out of that
felt right, felt good.

27:58.888 --> 28:00.848
Que viva Colombia!

28:04.851 --> 28:06.769
Huma! Huma!

28:07.060 --> 28:08.853
Thank you for supporting him!

28:08.936 --> 28:11.688
Forget about everybody else!
Bullshit everybody else!

28:11.771 --> 28:13.731
Don't worry about it!
Good for you!

28:18.944 --> 28:21.821
Breaking news just into our
newsroom in New York City.

28:21.904 --> 28:24.489
The New York Mayoral candidate
Anthony Weiner

28:24.572 --> 28:26.615
sent additional explicit photos

28:26.698 --> 28:28.783
and texts to a woman online.

28:28.866 --> 28:31.493
The new lewd correspondence
posted...

28:31.576 --> 28:33.976
Good afternoon, Weiner for
mayor. This is Michael speaking.

28:33.994 --> 28:35.328
They led people to believe

28:35.411 --> 28:37.663
he had put
all the sexting behind him...

28:37.746 --> 28:39.664
"The Dirty" just published
screen grabs

28:39.747 --> 28:42.750
of what they allege
are sexually explicit...

28:44.710 --> 28:46.253
And that's exactly
what happened.

28:46.336 --> 28:48.838
But the key question
is whether he engaged in his behavior?

28:48.921 --> 28:50.714
How does Huma Abedin react?

28:50.797 --> 28:52.715
When he vowed
to be a changed man.

28:52.798 --> 28:55.592
Now the website, as we mentioned,
is called "Dirty."

28:55.675 --> 28:57.218
I under, I understand.

28:57.301 --> 29:00.012
The photos did take place
after he left Congress

29:00.095 --> 29:02.138
July of 2012 about a year ago.

29:02.221 --> 29:05.474
Okay. I really appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

29:05.557 --> 29:06.808
Okay, bye-bye.

29:07.391 --> 29:08.725
What...?

29:09.892 --> 29:12.603
Are we going to be going nuclear?

29:12.686 --> 29:15.605
"This is absolutely not true
and this is fucking ridiculous?"

29:15.688 --> 29:17.856
Or is that not our strategy?

29:17.939 --> 29:20.107
That is not going to be the strategy.

29:20.190 --> 29:21.691
Not gonna be the strategy.

29:21.947 --> 29:23.667
When in fact, he is actually
going to have

29:23.692 --> 29:25.777
a press conference
in about 20 minutes

29:25.860 --> 29:27.903
to discuss this, we presume,
and some other things.

29:27.986 --> 29:30.071
Uh, but that is really
the key issue.

29:30.154 --> 29:32.865
Of course he resigned
from Congress June of 2011

29:32.948 --> 29:34.324
Alright.

29:39.995 --> 29:43.248
I've been told that Anthony Weiner
is on his way upstairs at the moment.

29:43.331 --> 29:45.291
We'll be hearing from him very soon.

29:45.374 --> 29:47.084
Uh, could you move forward
a little bit?

29:47.167 --> 29:49.448
If I do that, I'm gonna lose
my spot, so I'm not gonna..

29:49.460 --> 29:53.464
He will arrive at this press conference
with his wife, Huma Abedin...

29:53.547 --> 29:55.674
who he has said has forgiven him.

29:55.757 --> 30:00.720
Newly revealed messages are by far
the most explicit ones we've seen.

30:01.846 --> 30:04.557
Some people are wondering
whether she might show up today.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.352
The big question is whether
the allegations are true and..

30:10.604 --> 30:12.147
Can you find Huma for me?

30:15.608 --> 30:18.861
In this same window of time
there was one other person.

30:22.406 --> 30:25.575
I said it was over
an extended period of time.

30:25.658 --> 30:28.160
I never said
it started here and ended here.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.667
Fuck! Fuck me.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.754
What number can they dial on?

30:39.837 --> 30:40.671
You want me to dial it in?

30:40.754 --> 30:42.672
No. Could you get
Huma back in please?

30:42.755 --> 30:44.757
And then close the door and stay
on the other side of it for a while.

30:44.840 --> 30:48.041
I just, I don't mean disrespectful, but
please leave me alone for a little while.

30:53.022 --> 30:54.823
Do you know what the timing
of any of this is?

30:54.848 --> 30:56.182
No, I don't.

30:56.265 --> 30:57.933
- Not at all?
- I mean..

30:59.267 --> 31:01.560
It's when we were talking about the...

31:01.643 --> 31:03.269
about separating.

31:06.397 --> 31:07.856
So where are you on the statement?

31:07.939 --> 31:09.979
I... I can't get through
to them on the telephone.

31:10.024 --> 31:11.942
We keep getting interrupted.
Okay.

31:12.025 --> 31:14.360
They think this is not
gonna work.

31:14.443 --> 31:16.695
They think this is, whatever.
I... I don't know.

31:16.778 --> 31:20.448
I'm like very anxious about you
and I being apart today.

31:20.656 --> 31:22.282
Someone's gonna find you.

31:22.907 --> 31:25.635
- Yeah.
- Unless we get someone on the f'ing phone.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.011
Campaign office.
No, no, no, no.

31:29.094 --> 31:30.804
Okay, Anthony's just
trying to get you on.

31:30.887 --> 31:33.973
- Okay.
- Hi.

31:34.056 --> 31:35.816
Well, you're, you're saying
that the timeline

31:35.890 --> 31:38.058
is the problem with, again.

31:38.725 --> 31:40.518
By the way, Huma's on the line also.

31:40.601 --> 31:41.977
Okay, so go ahead.

31:44.312 --> 31:46.147
Obviously.

31:46.230 --> 31:51.485
Look, this is a continuum
of challenges in our marriage

31:51.568 --> 31:53.069
that ended at a certain point

31:53.152 --> 31:55.863
and we decided to move forward
with our lives

31:55.946 --> 31:58.865
and that's, that...
that was a problem and now it's behind us.

31:58.948 --> 32:01.075
And as we said, other things
would come out.

32:03.786 --> 32:04.828
No.

32:16.464 --> 32:21.010
Getting obviously, you know,
we're getting deluged.

32:24.930 --> 32:27.891
Well, my head is at

32:27.974 --> 32:30.977
try to sell this as something
that people already know.

32:33.062 --> 32:36.065
- Hello?
- You guys still there?

32:36.148 --> 32:37.232
Motherfuck..

32:58.211 --> 33:00.291
Can we just have the room
for a second, you two guys.

33:16.144 --> 33:17.937
Uh, good, uh, good afternoon.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.896
My name is Anthony Weiner,
Democratic candidate

33:19.979 --> 33:22.022
for mayor
of the City of New York.

33:22.105 --> 33:24.732
Um, I have said that other texts

33:24.815 --> 33:26.900
and photos were likely
to come out

33:26.983 --> 33:28.985
and today they have.

33:29.068 --> 33:31.945
Perhaps I'm surprised that more
things didn't come out sooner.

33:32.028 --> 33:35.197
Some of these things happened
before my resignation.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.783
Some of them happened after,
but the fact is that

33:38.866 --> 33:42.035
that was also the time that my
wife and I were working through

33:42.118 --> 33:43.786
some things in our marriage.

33:43.869 --> 33:45.328
But I'm pleased and blessed

33:45.411 --> 33:48.455
that she has given me
a second chance.

33:48.538 --> 33:50.164
Huma has been out there with me

33:50.247 --> 33:52.916
and she had a few words that she
wanted to say, so..

33:52.999 --> 33:55.042
Um, my amazing wife Huma Abedin.

33:57.544 --> 33:58.920
Hi, good evening.

33:59.003 --> 34:01.964
This is the first time I've
spoken at a press conference and

34:02.047 --> 34:04.632
um, you'll have to bear with me
'cause I'm very nervous.

34:04.715 --> 34:06.216
And I wrote down
what I wanted to say.

34:09.467 --> 34:13.138
When we faced this publicly
two years ago

34:13.221 --> 34:16.056
it took a lot of work..

34:16.139 --> 34:18.809
And a whole lot of therapy..

34:18.891 --> 34:21.185
To get to a place
where I could forgive Anthony.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.270
But I made the decision

34:24.353 --> 34:26.146
that it was worth staying
in this marriage.

34:30.233 --> 34:32.068
Anthony's made some
horrible mistakes..

34:34.277 --> 34:37.072
Both before he resigned
from Congress and after.

34:38.864 --> 34:41.951
But I do very strongly believe
that that is between us

34:42.034 --> 34:44.202
and on our marriage.

34:45.453 --> 34:49.415
So really what I want to say is,
I love him.

34:49.498 --> 34:52.626
I have forgiven him.
I believe in him.

34:52.708 --> 34:55.128
And as we have said
from the beginning

34:55.210 --> 34:57.087
we are moving forward.

34:57.170 --> 34:59.213
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

35:02.090 --> 35:05.009
Why should we trust
your judgment?

35:05.092 --> 35:08.095
Why? Why should we trust your
judgment?

35:08.178 --> 35:12.432
Weiner is admitting that new sexually
explicit online chat have surfaced..

35:12.515 --> 35:13.807
On the nightlife site..

35:13.890 --> 35:15.224
- "The Dirty."
- "The Dirty."

35:15.307 --> 35:16.641
Thedirty.com

35:18.266 --> 35:19.600
Looks, looks a little bit like

35:19.683 --> 35:21.226
he got it caught
in a waffle iron.

35:23.519 --> 35:26.021
Like a series

35:26.104 --> 35:29.941
a series of,
series of paint swatches.

35:30.024 --> 35:32.276
I believe that last color
is called public humiliation.

35:33.818 --> 35:36.028
It was not just sexting
or text messages.

35:36.111 --> 35:37.612
They spoke on the phone too?

35:37.695 --> 35:39.113
Multiple times daily.

35:39.196 --> 35:41.323
The timeline here
is absolutely crucial.

35:41.406 --> 35:44.450
Uh, very crucial. He resigned
from Congress in June of 2011.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.117
A little more than
two years ago.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.077
So, when yesterday,
this emerged..

35:50.787 --> 35:52.038
It was a problem.

35:52.121 --> 35:54.498
He did this big sweet spread
with his wife

35:54.581 --> 35:56.291
and his newborn son

35:56.374 --> 35:58.167
the same month
that he told the world

35:58.250 --> 36:00.001
"I really feel
like a different person."

36:00.084 --> 36:03.337
Turns out, it was true
he was a different person

36:03.420 --> 36:06.881
because he sent these penis
shots under the screen name..

36:06.964 --> 36:08.048
Carlos Danger.

36:08.131 --> 36:09.257
- Danger.
- Danger.

36:09.340 --> 36:10.924
Carlos Danger.

36:11.007 --> 36:13.217
I assume it was to avoid

36:13.300 --> 36:16.052
using a ridiculous name
like Anthony Weiner.

36:43.368 --> 36:47.038
Can we get that clip up
of Huma standing alongside..

36:47.121 --> 36:50.249
There is a victim
of spousal abuse.

36:50.332 --> 36:53.793
Spousal abuse.
It is sickening to watch this.

36:53.876 --> 36:57.004
She looked
completely despondent.

36:57.087 --> 37:00.090
Her face was looking away.
She was shifting on her feet.

37:00.173 --> 37:02.049
He's humiliated her
over and over again.

37:02.132 --> 37:03.883
Uh, what does it say
about a husband

37:03.966 --> 37:05.258
who lets his wife do that?

37:05.341 --> 37:06.884
Power, lust, personal gain

37:06.967 --> 37:08.134
and that's all the two
of them want.

37:08.217 --> 37:09.617
They don't care
about anything else.

37:09.634 --> 37:11.761
There was clearly
a calculation made

37:11.844 --> 37:14.096
that Huma being there
was going to be crucial

37:14.179 --> 37:17.932
to how people saw him, saw it,
saw their marriage.

37:18.015 --> 37:19.516
If Anthony Weiner's
mayoral campaign

37:19.599 --> 37:21.684
is gonna be saved tonight,
it's gonna be saved

37:21.767 --> 37:23.977
by his wife Huma Abedin.

37:33.486 --> 37:37.239
Ah, not great.
Not great. You know.

37:41.177 --> 37:43.888
Javier at the Times tried to
nail me down on that question...

37:43.971 --> 37:46.264
I don't really know the answer
to which is...

37:46.347 --> 37:48.724
"When did it cut off?"
You know?

37:48.807 --> 37:51.309
But she...
This girl has this narrative...

37:51.392 --> 37:55.562
has this timeline that I don't
have any way to check with or know.

37:58.313 --> 38:00.356
Shit!

38:00.439 --> 38:03.483
Okay. Alright, well, call, call
me when you have a chance.

38:03.566 --> 38:04.858
Alright, bye-bye.

38:04.941 --> 38:06.275
I need to follow up with him.

38:06.358 --> 38:08.693
I just want to look at the questions...

38:08.776 --> 38:12.237
and talk to you about how
you wanna answer those.

38:12.320 --> 38:15.156
So the answer to, "Were people in the
campaign other than Huma aware?"

38:15.239 --> 38:16.615
- Okay.
- No? Then..

38:17.324 --> 38:20.118
"Had there been multiple online
exchanges with multiple people..."

38:20.201 --> 38:21.744
"or was it just this one?"

38:23.412 --> 38:25.539
Can I just say multiple people?

38:25.622 --> 38:27.123
Or is it just this one?

38:27.206 --> 38:29.291
I think you've got to,
I mean, there was more than one.

38:29.374 --> 38:32.627
So, I think, I think we've got
to answer the question.

38:32.710 --> 38:34.378
Uh, okay.

38:34.461 --> 38:36.171
Problem was that, that

38:36.254 --> 38:37.546
series of interviews that I did

38:37.629 --> 38:39.922
when I got in the race
were after this.

38:41.757 --> 38:45.010
And people asked me
is the number still the same.

38:48.346 --> 38:51.182
I think I said to, six to
Dominic and then I cleaned it up

38:51.265 --> 38:54.393
in subsequent interviews 'cause
I knew that was a problem.

38:55.602 --> 38:57.520
Now, the question is,
do we answer it or not?

38:57.603 --> 38:59.354
I think we have to answer
these questions.

38:59.437 --> 39:01.355
I think we have to answer it
because if somebody else

39:01.438 --> 39:03.106
comes out and we don't...

39:03.189 --> 39:05.316
So, okay. So then you'll give
them an answer.

39:05.399 --> 39:06.525
So I'm going to say...

39:06.608 --> 39:07.692
Yes.

39:07.775 --> 39:09.151
Um..

39:11.611 --> 39:13.195
It was more than one.

39:15.405 --> 39:17.805
"Do you believe you're suffering
from any sort of addiction?"

39:21.202 --> 39:23.412
Um..

39:23.495 --> 39:25.288
I was asked
that question during the..

39:25.371 --> 39:29.249
We gotta get all of my interviews
and he's gonna ask, uh-uh-uh-uh..

39:29.332 --> 39:31.292
He said now.

39:31.375 --> 39:32.376
He's answered
this question before.

39:32.459 --> 39:34.544
I think I answered in the
New York Times magazine's story.

39:34.627 --> 39:36.428
I did. I did. I answered.
Yeah, you said no.

39:36.503 --> 39:38.004
I think you can say,
"I think, I think Anthony

39:38.087 --> 39:39.505
"touched upon this in the,
in the "New York Times"

39:39.588 --> 39:40.547
magazine profile."

39:41.317 --> 39:43.357
You don't have to answer right
at this moment, so...

39:43.382 --> 39:46.009
No, I'm giving you the answer.
You showed me a thing with the question.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.301
And I'm trying to give you an answer.
Why do you keep saying...

39:47.384 --> 39:49.094
I thought, I thought
you were thinking about it.

39:49.177 --> 39:51.257
I thought you were trying...
No, I'm talking words.

39:52.286 --> 39:54.447
"What's the strategy moving forward?"
is his other one.

39:54.472 --> 39:57.516
Um, it's whatever the answer
was when I got in the race.

39:57.599 --> 39:58.960
I think it's,
it's something that..

40:00.767 --> 40:01.768
I don't know.

40:01.851 --> 40:03.477
What's the strategy going forward...?

40:04.186 --> 40:05.187
Um..

40:29.043 --> 40:32.171
It sounds stupid to say this
but yeah, these are people

40:32.254 --> 40:36.383
you know, you're friends with,
you know, your, you know..

40:36.466 --> 40:38.050
You're in the...
you know, you're

40:38.133 --> 40:40.051
tonight you're like
pen pals with.

40:44.805 --> 40:49.935
And, um, it was connecting
on such a..

40:50.018 --> 40:53.479
Superficial level,
it was almost as if..

40:53.562 --> 40:55.188
It's almost as if I was,
you know, playing, you know

40:55.271 --> 40:57.314
had a... a, I'm playing a video
game, you know?

40:57.397 --> 41:00.650
Um, you know, people would
reach out to me

41:00.733 --> 41:03.318
and we'd start just chatting
and then, you know

41:03.401 --> 41:06.404
sending e-mails back and
forth, or Facebook, whatever

41:06.487 --> 41:08.447
or something that goes
in a different direction.

41:08.530 --> 41:10.532
Someone says you're amazing
and sending me a naked picture

41:10.615 --> 41:11.657
and I respond to it.

41:23.460 --> 41:25.253
I had a blind spot about it

41:25.336 --> 41:27.504
and that blind spot
was a pretty big one.

41:29.172 --> 41:31.549
Now, I want to stress,
this is verbatim.

41:31.632 --> 41:34.760
This is exactly
what went back and forth

41:34.843 --> 41:37.595
between Congressman Weiner

41:37.678 --> 41:40.347
and the blackjack dealer
from Las Vegas, Lisa.

41:40.430 --> 41:44.225
And if you'll start us off
with Lisa's first line.

41:44.308 --> 41:46.476
"Are you as passionate
in the sack

41:46.559 --> 41:48.602
as you are about politics?"

41:49.936 --> 41:51.854
"Baby, you'd be crawling
for the door

41:51.937 --> 41:53.980
to prevent me
from fucking you silly."

41:55.564 --> 41:58.358
"Nice!
Just what I'm looking for.

41:58.441 --> 42:01.777
I wanna bang the future mayor
of New York City."

42:04.112 --> 42:06.239
"Making me hard."

42:18.167 --> 42:20.502
Parsing language is clearly
not the right way to go.

42:20.585 --> 42:22.795
And that was a mistake
on my part.

42:22.878 --> 42:26.339
The level of guilt
and pain and..

42:26.422 --> 42:29.675
That I feel, you know, I'm very sorry
I put everyone in this position.

42:29.758 --> 42:31.468
It's gonna continue
a little while..

42:31.551 --> 42:32.426
Hi.

42:32.509 --> 42:35.470
It's gonna continue
a little while longer.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.389
But I, you know,
generally think scandals

42:38.472 --> 42:42.225
you cry and crisis management
has a 72 hour window.

42:42.308 --> 42:46.603
After the 72 hours, it's not on
the lead of Drudge anymore.

42:46.686 --> 42:48.521
We're gonna try to look normal,

42:48.604 --> 42:50.647
like we're holding together
as a group.

42:50.730 --> 42:52.148
It's gonna be rough
for a little while.

42:52.231 --> 42:55.067
Where we really are is back
to where we were on day one.

42:55.150 --> 42:56.526
All that being said
I want to give you a chance

42:56.609 --> 43:00.446
to, to, to either vent
or to ask me questions.

43:00.529 --> 43:03.865
I think that my team is in
a better place than I'm in.

43:03.948 --> 43:06.617
I'm in a very bad place
to be very frank.

43:06.700 --> 43:10.745
I'm extremely frustrated
at your lack of clarity with me

43:10.828 --> 43:12.538
in the innumerable conversations

43:12.621 --> 43:15.624
that we had leading up
to me joining the campaign.

43:15.707 --> 43:17.959
Um, I have not made
any decisions

43:18.042 --> 43:19.752
about what I'm doing
or what I'm not doing.

43:21.587 --> 43:24.047
As of this moment, I am here.

43:24.130 --> 43:25.631
I'm in this room
and I'm in this campaign.

43:25.714 --> 43:27.298
- Okay.
- I think we can continue this conversation.

43:27.417 --> 43:28.457
Okay. We'll continue it.

43:28.482 --> 43:29.941
Amit. You guys should talk directly,
the two of you.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.704
What are you, the referee over
there? Okay.

43:31.733 --> 43:34.193
No, I'm just saying, I mean,
it's Amit. He's like family.

43:34.276 --> 43:35.777
No, I know,
but I just wanted to see if there

43:35.860 --> 43:37.528
might be things that other
people might want to say like

43:37.611 --> 43:38.570
"Yeah, I'm... I'm there too
and.."

43:38.653 --> 43:39.654
I'm, I feel

43:39.737 --> 43:42.156
um, and I think some of us
have been frustrated

43:42.239 --> 43:45.784
with feeling like we're left
in the dark, not even about

43:45.867 --> 43:50.162
you know, the actual... situation

43:50.245 --> 43:52.664
but more like,
how it's being handled.

43:52.747 --> 43:55.458
My whole team, Barbara's team

43:55.541 --> 43:58.752
like, they really
want an apology.

43:58.835 --> 44:01.212
- Right. Got it. I understand.
- But that, that was..

44:01.295 --> 44:03.547
I would like to flag
for everybody that

44:03.630 --> 44:06.591
stuff like this, people are
reporting back to the "New York Post."

44:06.674 --> 44:10.678
And it becomes something where,
I'm walking down the street

44:10.761 --> 44:12.554
and getting berated by
a New York Post reporter.

44:12.637 --> 44:14.013
- Well, look..
- It's fine, you guys, it's fine.

44:14.096 --> 44:17.096
It was horrific to watch today the way
they were treating you in the street.

44:17.140 --> 44:19.559
"Yeah, we were walking and they were
badgering her, and they were like...

44:19.642 --> 44:22.811
If you don't answer our questions, we're going
to write that you're having an affair!"

44:22.894 --> 44:24.520
And it was bad.

44:24.770 --> 44:27.272
Just a quick optics thing
as Barbara's really leaving.

44:27.355 --> 44:28.856
I assume those photographers
are still outside.

44:28.939 --> 44:31.650
So, you will look happy?

44:31.733 --> 44:32.734
Yes.

44:32.817 --> 44:34.026
I'm saying this for you.

44:34.109 --> 44:35.819
I don't want it be,
"The press secretary walked out

44:35.902 --> 44:37.570
very upset at 6:30."

44:37.653 --> 44:40.697
Everyone has to exhale
a little bit, okay?

44:40.780 --> 44:43.616
This has been a brutally
difficult few days.

44:43.699 --> 44:45.492
Take a deep breath,
have a drink.

44:45.575 --> 44:47.326
This isn't life and death.
No one's..

44:47.409 --> 44:48.785
- No one died.
- No one died.

44:48.868 --> 44:53.622
The entire world knows about
this campaign, warts and all.

44:53.705 --> 44:55.707
There's a lot of intensity
and I know I brought it upon you

44:55.790 --> 44:59.084
but I don't want it to make you
crazy, so..

45:08.008 --> 45:10.343
Joining me now to discuss
her online relationship

45:10.426 --> 45:12.886
with Anthony Weiner,
Sydney Leathers.

45:12.969 --> 45:15.680
How did all this happen?
How did, how did this begin?

45:15.763 --> 45:18.724
Um, in 2011,
I messaged him on Facebook

45:18.807 --> 45:22.268
chastising him for his behavior
with the first scandal.

45:22.351 --> 45:25.312
He said that he was sorry
that he let me down

45:25.395 --> 45:27.605
then started to compliment me
on my appearance

45:27.688 --> 45:30.315
on my political views,
my writing.

45:30.398 --> 45:31.649
I mean, just anything
you can think of.

45:31.732 --> 45:32.899
He's laying it on thick.

45:32.982 --> 45:34.108
So you would have phone sex
with him

45:34.191 --> 45:35.609
and how often would he call you?

45:35.692 --> 45:37.068
Uh, the most he ever called
me was about five times

45:37.151 --> 45:39.361
in a day, which is a lot.

45:39.444 --> 45:40.945
- For phone sex?
- Yeah.

45:56.501 --> 45:58.102
Good morning, my name
is Anthony Weiner

45:58.127 --> 46:00.712
Democratic candidate for mayor
of the City of New York.

46:00.795 --> 46:03.714
Today we're focusing
on creating a nonprofit czar

46:03.797 --> 46:06.549
to be a liaison with nonprofit
organizations.

46:06.632 --> 46:09.313
And I'll be glad to take any on-topic
questions that you might have.

46:11.803 --> 46:13.554
Any on-topic?

46:16.431 --> 46:17.831
Yes, sir?
Off topic, is that okay?

46:17.848 --> 46:18.890
Sure, certainly, sir.

46:20.849 --> 46:21.850
I'm sorry, Ma'am?

46:24.936 --> 46:27.772
How many women were there?
Can you remember?

46:27.855 --> 46:29.064
Six to ten, I suppose.

46:29.147 --> 46:31.899
But I... I can't tell you
absolutely what someone else

46:31.982 --> 46:33.692
is gonna consider
inappropriate or not.

46:33.775 --> 46:36.068
Were they sexual, how many
conversations did you have

46:36.151 --> 46:40.071
with women after you resigned
that were sexual in nature?

46:40.154 --> 46:42.489
I don't believe
I had any more than three.

46:42.572 --> 46:45.825
Why don't you just,
right now tell everybody

46:45.908 --> 46:48.619
everything that you could
possibly remember about this

46:48.702 --> 46:50.782
so that we all get it out
of the way and then you can

46:50.787 --> 46:51.954
go back to the real campaign.

46:52.037 --> 46:53.705
I basically have.

46:53.788 --> 46:55.122
I mean, the only thing you
haven't learned

46:55.205 --> 46:57.790
you want names of people, right?

46:57.873 --> 46:58.790
I'm not gonna do that.

46:58.873 --> 47:00.541
If someone wants to bring
themselves out

47:00.624 --> 47:02.125
why should I drag them
into this?

47:02.208 --> 47:05.711
The point is they're behind me.
It's a year ago, at least.

47:05.794 --> 47:06.920
You keep saying that
this is behind you

47:07.003 --> 47:08.754
but you've said that before,
last Summer.

47:08.837 --> 47:12.632
You told "People" magazine that this
was over. How can voters trust now?

47:12.715 --> 47:13.924
How can they be a hundred
percent confident..

47:14.007 --> 47:16.884
There's a phoniness
on that side of the debate

47:16.967 --> 47:19.719
about how outrageous
my behavior is.

47:19.802 --> 47:21.722
They love stoking it.
They love talking about it.

47:21.761 --> 47:25.139
They love building me up,
having me on their show

47:25.222 --> 47:28.016
so they can excoriate me
and everything else.

47:28.099 --> 47:30.935
There's a phoniness to it,
but let's..

47:31.018 --> 47:34.354
I'm gonna make this very clear.
I mean, I did the thing though.

47:34.437 --> 47:36.772
So when I, and I'm as, you know,
I... I wouldn't have told you

47:36.855 --> 47:38.773
I was, you know,
that I understood politics

47:38.856 --> 47:40.357
and I understand the rhythm of
the press and everything else.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.733
I did the thing,
so it's not their fault

47:42.816 --> 47:44.108
that they played their role.

47:44.191 --> 47:46.818
They just were doing, you know

47:46.901 --> 47:49.904
it's the, it's the frog
and the, and the scorpion.

47:49.987 --> 47:52.698
Yeah, I mean, did you take
any of it personally?

47:52.781 --> 47:54.949
It's hard, uh... uh, I mean

47:55.032 --> 47:59.828
I... I think the same
constitutional, the same

47:59.911 --> 48:04.665
constitution that I have that
made me do the dumb thing..

48:06.208 --> 48:07.709
Made it possible for me to

48:07.792 --> 48:09.960
to weather the stuff
without it gutting me.

48:14.130 --> 48:16.490
I think I've pretty much said
what I have to say about that.

48:16.506 --> 48:18.591
Now, what I would like to talk
about is housing in the Bronx.

48:18.674 --> 48:19.758
Any questions about that?

48:22.360 --> 48:24.680
Well, questions about, question
about housing in the Bronx.

48:24.736 --> 48:27.321
Who cares about his issues?

48:27.404 --> 48:29.697
We want to know
what he's going to do for us.

48:29.780 --> 48:32.991
We don't care
about that personal garbage.

48:33.074 --> 48:36.535
We're from the Bronx.
We don't care about his personal garbage.

48:55.052 --> 48:56.803
Where is Lawrence tonight?

48:56.886 --> 48:57.845
He's in D.C.

48:57.928 --> 49:01.139
His voice will play in the earpiece,
not in the studio.

49:06.227 --> 49:08.979
Joining me now
is Anthony Weiner. Thank..

49:10.772 --> 49:12.815
It's my pleasure, Lawrence.
How are you?

49:15.609 --> 49:20.030
For me it just comes down
to this, which is..

49:20.113 --> 49:21.405
"What is wrong with you?"

49:23.473 --> 49:25.674
I don't understand the
question, what is wrong with me

49:25.699 --> 49:27.992
that I care so much about the
issues that I fight for everyday

49:28.075 --> 49:30.535
that I have, my entire career?

49:30.618 --> 49:31.619
No.

49:31.702 --> 49:33.023
Are you, are you saying that, uh

49:33.077 --> 49:35.788
because I have things in my personal life
that are embarrassing

49:35.871 --> 49:37.998
I shouldn't run for office? Okay,
that's, that's a fair position to have.

49:38.081 --> 49:40.083
Some people have it.

49:40.166 --> 49:41.083
Well, you're not
being clear, Lawrence.

49:41.166 --> 49:42.792
So, so, so let's, let's work

49:42.875 --> 49:45.043
a little harder at that.

49:45.126 --> 49:49.338
It does not seem to be a fully
healthy pursuit for your life.

49:49.421 --> 49:51.840
I know there are a lot of people,
there are a lot of people who talk.

49:51.923 --> 49:52.924
Look, there are a lot of people
who talked about..

49:53.007 --> 49:55.092
The totality
of your life, Anthony

49:55.175 --> 49:57.594
do you think you've spent
your time well...

49:57.677 --> 49:59.437
Ah, first off, that's not,
uh... uh... uh..

50:02.640 --> 50:05.100
Anthony, I think there
is something wrong with you.

50:05.183 --> 50:06.893
I know. You just said that.
You just said that.

50:06.976 --> 50:09.353
Repeating it doesn't make it
more interesting.

50:09.436 --> 50:10.979
I'm looking at your life.

50:11.062 --> 50:13.230
Well, I appreciate it.

50:13.313 --> 50:16.941
You are relentless about
some, about certain things..

50:17.024 --> 50:19.860
That is not, that's not true.
That's not true.

50:20.652 --> 50:21.903
That's not true.

50:21.986 --> 50:25.406
What I'm trying to get at,
Anthony, is what drives you?

50:25.489 --> 50:28.033
Okay, tell, in that case,
ask me that question.

50:28.116 --> 50:29.876
You don't like things
that you know about me.

50:29.950 --> 50:32.327
You want to make fun of me
on television. Join the club!

50:32.410 --> 50:35.621
Frankly, bigger guys than you
have been trying to knock me down.

50:35.704 --> 50:38.039
I mean it from
a psychiatric level.

50:38.122 --> 50:41.166
Dude, dude, I don't really
need your psychiatric questions.

50:41.249 --> 50:43.376
All you can focus on is,
"What's wrong with you?

50:43.459 --> 50:44.960
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?"

50:45.043 --> 50:47.128
That's not it,
it's to debate either.

50:49.088 --> 50:51.799
I don't plan on losing.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.259
Maybe I'll come on,
maybe I'll come on this show

50:54.342 --> 50:57.094
and kick your ass every night,
like I'm doing tonight.

50:59.874 --> 51:02.155
You'll get the last word
online if you want it, Anthony.

51:02.180 --> 51:03.101
Good night, Lawrence.

51:20.113 --> 51:22.907
Part of what animates me
is I hate bullies.

51:27.036 --> 51:30.581
It is pretty easy to beat me up.

51:30.664 --> 51:33.291
It's not that hard and I just
don't respect it all that much.

51:57.106 --> 52:00.943
Bigger guys than you have tried to
knock me down and I'm still here.

52:01.026 --> 52:03.486
And honestly, I'm an easy target for
you to say, "What's wrong with you?"

52:03.569 --> 52:06.196
"I don't know something
in your private life that's embarrassing."

52:06.279 --> 52:08.281
Congratulations.
You can get on the list.

52:08.364 --> 52:11.116
But I ultimately don't care
what you think about that.

52:11.199 --> 52:14.660
I have never once criticized
you for your texting.

52:14.743 --> 52:18.037
I think your photography
is just perfectly

52:18.120 --> 52:21.164
a standard American photography
that's floating around the internet now.

52:21.247 --> 52:23.123
I've never said anything
about that.

52:23.206 --> 52:25.625
You just believe
that I shouldn't run once that happened.

52:25.708 --> 52:28.628
Even if I think I'm the better candidate
with the better ideas, don't run.

52:28.710 --> 52:30.086
I don't have a problem,
but don't run.

52:30.169 --> 52:33.630
You know, Anthony, that you
are a gravely damaged candidate.

52:33.713 --> 52:34.839
I said so..

52:34.922 --> 52:36.465
Pretty crazy.

52:36.548 --> 52:38.428
Who do you think looks better
though, me or him?

52:40.259 --> 52:43.136
Do you want to see the online
version... where we continued?

52:44.428 --> 52:46.054
Why are you laughing?
This is crazy.

52:46.137 --> 52:49.014
It's terribly crazy, but what
else was I supposed to do?

52:49.097 --> 52:52.141
I mean, tell me
what I was supposed to do.

52:52.224 --> 52:54.142
This is where it continued.

52:54.225 --> 52:55.643
- No, no, no, no.
- No?

52:55.726 --> 52:56.768
Focus on your speech..

52:56.851 --> 52:58.018
This just makes me feel better.

52:58.101 --> 53:00.269
This makes me get more fight
in me and less emotional.

53:00.352 --> 53:03.271
- Oh, really?
- A little bit.

53:03.354 --> 53:06.982
And it got better here because
he realized how badly it went, I think.

53:08.775 --> 53:09.609
How bad was it?

53:10.151 --> 53:11.068
It's bad.

53:11.151 --> 53:13.278
For me?
What was I supposed to do?

53:16.947 --> 53:18.365
Sorry, I can't.

53:21.135 --> 53:23.135
What's wrong with you?
No, what's wrong with you?

53:23.160 --> 53:25.162
That every night you
have to be on television.

53:25.245 --> 53:26.454
You need a lot of attention.
What are you craving?

53:26.537 --> 53:27.788
What do you got to prove?

53:27.871 --> 53:29.914
You know,
that's a good question?

53:29.997 --> 53:32.541
Whatever the opposite
of that is, it's what Huma is.

53:35.293 --> 53:37.253
She must like that about you right?

53:38.754 --> 53:40.547
No, I think she might...

53:42.173 --> 53:43.799
like me in spite of that.

53:46.885 --> 53:50.138
Huma Abedin, what is the
simple explanation

53:50.221 --> 53:54.016
for why she decided to get out
there in front of this?

53:54.099 --> 53:55.975
I fall back
to the... the Blaise Pascal

53:56.058 --> 53:57.100
the philosopher who said

53:57.183 --> 54:00.311
"The heart has its reasons
of which reason knows nothing."

54:00.394 --> 54:03.980
In other words, I don't think this is
simply a strategic, uh, decision for her.

54:04.063 --> 54:06.523
I think Huma loves this guy.
She thinks he'd be a good mayor.

54:06.606 --> 54:09.525
What you saw at that press conference
was the real Huma.

54:09.608 --> 54:11.901
Blaise Pascal, you say.

54:12.085 --> 54:13.920
I counter that with Shakespeare

54:14.003 --> 54:16.338
"Has she eaten
on the insane route

54:16.421 --> 54:19.132
that devours intellect
and takes reason prisoner?"

54:36.940 --> 54:39.192
Do you think she's feeling regret?

54:39.275 --> 54:40.442
What about?

54:40.525 --> 54:42.151
- The whole thing?
- Yeah.

54:45.529 --> 54:47.239
It's... it's..

54:48.198 --> 54:51.367
It's not fair.
She shouldn't, but she does.

54:57.247 --> 54:58.539
You mean fair to you?

54:58.622 --> 55:01.249
No, it's unfair to her.
I mean she's not...

55:01.332 --> 55:03.250
I created this problem.

55:03.333 --> 55:08.254
Whatever acquiescence she gave
is secondary to the things that I did.

55:08.337 --> 55:10.589
These things that I created for us.

55:12.757 --> 55:15.259
Do you think it's been
worse than she thought?

55:15.342 --> 55:16.509
Yeah.

55:25.518 --> 55:27.186
How are you feeling today?

55:38.197 --> 55:39.448
It's like living a nightmare.

55:55.462 --> 55:58.256
Carlos Danger is now
trailing by nine points.

55:58.339 --> 56:00.799
Twenty-five to sixteen percent.

56:10.057 --> 56:13.310
Fifty three percent
of likely New York City voters

56:13.393 --> 56:17.438
think Anthony Weiner
should pull out.

56:27.029 --> 56:30.365
The most unpopular political
figure on record.

56:30.448 --> 56:33.367
An unfavorability
rating of eighty percent.

56:39.066 --> 56:41.307
I think that we can't afford
to leave the playing field

56:41.332 --> 56:42.833
for too many days is my concern.

56:44.543 --> 56:46.503
Got it. Alright.

56:47.879 --> 56:50.423
So she's trying
to sell her story.

56:50.506 --> 56:52.466
- Oh, really?
- That's what he heard.

57:00.515 --> 57:03.684
Rodney does this...
Rodney does this joke.

57:03.934 --> 57:05.393
I was in a very rough
neighborhood.

57:05.476 --> 57:06.852
The other day I asked a cop,
"Where's the nearest subway?"

57:06.935 --> 57:10.271
He says, "I don't know.
No one's ever made it."

57:10.354 --> 57:12.564
The other day on the way home,
some guy's running naked down the street.

57:12.647 --> 57:15.316
I says, "Hey, what happened?"
He says, "You came home early."

57:15.399 --> 57:17.484
My doc said,
"'Cause you're crazy."

57:17.567 --> 57:18.317
I said,
"I want a second opinion."

57:18.400 --> 57:19.680
He says,
"Okay, you're ugly too."

57:22.023 --> 57:23.503
The Rodney jokes
are easy to remember.

57:23.528 --> 57:25.780
Like they're just, you know..
'Cause they're stupid.

57:25.863 --> 57:29.825
Oh, Rodney, no. He's a classic, Rodney.
What are you talking about?

57:29.908 --> 57:33.077
"Oh, boy, so nowadays for, I am,
I need two women

57:33.160 --> 57:35.620
so when I fall asleep they have
someone to talk to. Oh, boy."

57:35.703 --> 57:37.454
"My sex life
ain't what it used to be."

57:40.623 --> 57:41.874
Oh, boy.

57:51.383 --> 57:53.676
Anthony Weiner's sexting
partner Sydney Leathers

57:53.759 --> 57:55.510
has got a sex tape now.

57:55.593 --> 57:57.761
TMZ's reporting Leathers
has already jumped

57:57.844 --> 58:00.179
into bed
with Vivid Entertainment

58:00.262 --> 58:02.013
less than two weeks
after the scandal broke.

58:02.096 --> 58:05.015
Vivid, of course, brought you
the sex tapes from Kim Kardashian

58:05.098 --> 58:07.517
and most recently,
"Teen mom Farrah Abraham."

58:12.688 --> 58:15.399
He ended up running
for mayor of New York City

58:15.482 --> 58:18.526
which he's still currently
in the race for.

58:18.609 --> 58:20.485
He was actually number one
in the polls

58:20.568 --> 58:22.486
before the scandal broke

58:22.569 --> 58:24.487
and then I ruined that for him.

58:24.570 --> 58:26.029
So, sorry.

58:26.112 --> 58:27.530
Except I'm not.

58:29.657 --> 58:33.494
I had him on this pedestal
and I thought he was this great guy

58:33.577 --> 58:36.496
and I felt like
we had similar views

58:36.579 --> 58:39.498
but you know it really is true
that you shouldn't meet your heroes

58:39.581 --> 58:41.457
because you find out how human
they really are

58:41.540 --> 58:43.250
and how flawed they really are

58:43.333 --> 58:46.544
and it really ruins your
perception of the person, so..

58:48.587 --> 58:49.879
Don't meet your heroes.

58:56.594 --> 58:58.429
Hello.

58:58.512 --> 58:59.679
Hello.

59:01.639 --> 59:02.765
Hello.

59:05.350 --> 59:09.520
I made mistakes that embarrassed
myself, hurt my family

59:09.603 --> 59:13.523
and for that I am profoundly,
profoundly sorry.

59:13.606 --> 59:15.649
And for that
I am profoundly sorry.

59:15.732 --> 59:18.276
For that I am profoundly sorry.

59:18.359 --> 59:21.236
But at the end of the day,
this campaign is not about me

59:21.319 --> 59:23.487
or really anyone else
on this stage.

59:29.618 --> 59:32.621
Welcome. This service
provided by free conference..

59:34.331 --> 59:35.373
Hi. Good morning.

59:35.456 --> 59:38.584
It's Anthony and got Camille
here. Love your spots.

59:38.667 --> 59:40.001
You were great.

59:40.334 --> 59:42.669
This thing isn't
turning on its own.

59:42.752 --> 59:46.088
We think we have to do
something different and so..

59:46.171 --> 59:48.506
Anthony, we've done 350 interviews.

59:48.589 --> 59:50.507
We now have Quinn ahead.

59:51.382 --> 59:55.386
Thompson second.
We have 27, 21, 16, 10.

59:55.469 --> 59:56.553
You're at 10.

59:56.636 --> 59:59.305
Half of your previous base went elsewhere.

59:59.388 --> 01:00:02.432
Everybody else is basically
saying enough already.

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:05.684
They've closed that door.

01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:08.186
You polled in
the middle of a time

01:00:08.269 --> 01:00:10.938
when we weren't doing anything at all
to define our own narrative.

01:00:11.647 --> 01:00:12.527
No, I understand that.

01:00:12.564 --> 01:00:15.275
I don't think you've ever done a snapshot
for a candidate

01:00:15.358 --> 01:00:17.078
who is going through
a worse week than I am.

01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:18.485
That's a fair statement.

01:00:18.568 --> 01:00:24.073
So maybe we use it to tee up
you know, I don't know some kind

01:00:24.156 --> 01:00:27.576
of a Bulworth kind of karma that
we just like "look," you know?

01:00:28.159 --> 01:00:29.743
Let me just be brutally honest here.

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.577
There's no chance to win anymore.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:35.747
Winning is now defined as if
Anthony wants to continue here...

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:38.457
keeping his head high and
saying something that matters.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.126
And getting some, at least grudging,
respect back.

01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:44.669
For your sake, you want to
keep going with this...

01:00:44.752 --> 01:00:48.648
that may be the best and
liberating way to proceed.

01:00:48.731 --> 01:00:53.277
I don't think there's a path
anymore to get to a runoff.

01:00:54.653 --> 01:00:57.238
You know, let's, let's remember
something we... we've just

01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:00.657
been pummeled in this week.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.825
Just pummeled..
Just, just everywhere.

01:01:02.908 --> 01:01:06.703
I mean, we basically not really mounted
much of a defense at all.

01:01:06.786 --> 01:01:11.040
So why don't we do this,
why don't we

01:01:11.123 --> 01:01:15.085
slap a version of that "I ain't
quitting" thing on the website.

01:01:15.168 --> 01:01:20.089
Why don't I call around to...
I'll call around to the-the TVs

01:01:20.172 --> 01:01:21.631
give them all a one-on-one
tomorrow.

01:01:21.714 --> 01:01:23.924
If you sort of go frontal
with that again...

01:01:24.007 --> 01:01:26.217
people are going to have
an instant negative reaction.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.510
“I don't want to hear that anymore.”

01:01:29.677 --> 01:01:32.763
So this is a solo flight.

01:01:34.973 --> 01:01:38.393
Okay, thank you very much,
guys. I appreciate it.

01:01:39.644 --> 01:01:41.187
- Thank you.
- Take care.

01:01:45.733 --> 01:01:48.944
Seriously, like fuck those guys.

01:01:49.027 --> 01:01:50.862
But you dropped
10 points in a week.

01:01:50.945 --> 01:01:54.156
What's to say you can't go
back up ten points in a week?

01:01:56.158 --> 01:01:58.660
I have one more thing on
the public schedule, or two?

01:01:58.743 --> 01:02:01.579
I think it's two - I think it's
the City Island hit.

01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:03.622
I'm getting crushed there.

01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:05.790
Just crushed.

01:02:10.836 --> 01:02:12.879
Do you still want
to go to City Island?

01:02:14.672 --> 01:02:16.840
Yes, ah-ah, am I getting any
reports from City...

01:02:16.923 --> 01:02:20.343
Yes, um, Andrew, I-I've got no choice.
It's on the public schedule.

01:02:21.719 --> 01:02:23.470
I have to go.

01:02:34.895 --> 01:02:37.731
So right now we have another
speaker, Mr. Weiner.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.357
Oh, thank you very much
for reminding me...

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.566
Go home!

01:02:41.857 --> 01:02:44.860
You know, I've had a little bit
of a rough week

01:02:44.943 --> 01:02:47.820
I had committed to coming here
and I didn't want to miss it.

01:02:47.903 --> 01:02:50.363
Communities like City Island
kinda reflect

01:02:50.446 --> 01:02:52.072
everything that is good
about this city and also

01:02:52.155 --> 01:02:53.781
what has kind of
gone wrong recently.

01:02:53.864 --> 01:02:58.702
You the residents of this community
had a 160% increase in property taxes.

01:02:58.785 --> 01:03:00.787
That's what the math is.

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:03.289
So sooner or later,
something has to give.

01:03:03.372 --> 01:03:05.791
I'm prepared to fight for
the people of this city

01:03:05.874 --> 01:03:07.876
and I'd love to hear your
questions, thank you very much.

01:03:09.293 --> 01:03:12.796
I'm gonna address the 900 pound gorilla
in the room...

01:03:12.879 --> 01:03:17.133
You lied to the people of New York
and you asked for forgiveness.

01:03:17.216 --> 01:03:19.092
The people of City Island,
the people of New York,

01:03:19.175 --> 01:03:20.801
Americans are very forgiving.

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:25.805
And then you go ahead and you do
it again, so the question is...

01:03:25.888 --> 01:03:29.808
is there someone better qualified than you
to do this job

01:03:29.891 --> 01:03:31.684
and when do you say enough is
enough if you do at all?

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:38.189
It's a betrayal of trust.

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:43.819
My... my personal issues
are very public.

01:03:43.902 --> 01:03:46.988
If you believe it's on the same
level as committing a crime

01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:48.322
if that's what you believe
that's your right.

01:03:48.405 --> 01:03:49.326
A betrayal... of trust.

01:03:49.405 --> 01:03:50.697
But I... no, let me just finish
the answer.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:52.448
Let me... let me
finish the answer.

01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:53.731
Yes, sir, you're exactly right.

01:03:53.781 --> 01:03:56.450
I violated trust to my wife.
I did that.

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:58.535
That was wrong.
That was my... I was wrong.

01:03:58.618 --> 01:04:00.536
I was wrong. And people have
every right

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:03.663
in the world to say that
it disqualifies me.

01:04:03.746 --> 01:04:05.164
But I'm not gonna quit.

01:04:05.247 --> 01:04:06.915
Do you think it was easy?

01:04:06.998 --> 01:04:09.917
Do you think I just... "Okay,
let's go to-to City Island."

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.127
"Let's talk
to these good people."

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.610
"Let's bring 50 cameras,"
knowing that I'd get this question?

01:04:14.628 --> 01:04:18.256
The reason I did that is because
I'm trying to communicate something here.

01:04:18.339 --> 01:04:20.966
I'm trying to say, "Yes, you
know some things about me"

01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:22.809
more than any candidate than
you'll ever know

01:04:22.883 --> 01:04:25.427
maybe in your life, maybe way
more than you'd want.

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:27.178
Certainly way more than I want.

01:04:28.928 --> 01:04:30.346
But all I can do is this.

01:04:30.429 --> 01:04:32.806
These are my ideas.
I care about them.

01:04:32.889 --> 01:04:34.891
I knew when I got in
this race that

01:04:34.974 --> 01:04:36.454
this kitchen was gonna
get pretty hot.

01:04:36.475 --> 01:04:39.978
And at a certain point, you've
got to say, "Look, I don't quit.

01:04:40.061 --> 01:04:41.687
New Yorkers don't quit."

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.855
I'm not gonna go into the corner
and curl up because someone

01:04:43.938 --> 01:04:45.578
found out something
embarrassing about me.

01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:47.815
You did something we don't like.
Camera's in your face.

01:04:47.898 --> 01:04:49.858
Change your mind.
Back down. Quit.

01:04:49.941 --> 01:04:51.984
That's not the kind of mayor
I'm gonna be.

01:04:52.067 --> 01:04:53.735
Sir, I say to you
with all due respect

01:04:53.818 --> 01:04:55.778
do not vote for me, but don't
deny these people

01:04:55.861 --> 01:04:57.279
the right to vote for me
that might want to.

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:02.741
Thank you very much.

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:13.793
I'm done, guys, I am done.
I'm off my fucking heels.

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:17.921
That posture of like sitting back and
letting people punch me, I'm done with it.

01:05:24.718 --> 01:05:27.095
At the end of the day, turn some
issues and ideas.

01:05:27.178 --> 01:05:28.637
Alright. How you doing, my
friend? Nice to see you.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.971
All the secrets?

01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:36.893
That guy's running for mayor.

01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:39.228
You say, "Hey Mr. Dude,
tell him to vote for me."

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:41.980
Hello! How's business today,
ladies?

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:44.190
You should get a little
discount for that.

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.440
How you doing my friend?
I'm Anthony Weiner.

01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:46.899
I'm running for mayor.

01:05:46.982 --> 01:05:48.942
Be well. Have a sweet year.

01:05:49.859 --> 01:05:51.861
You're a real scumbag, Anthony.

01:05:51.944 --> 01:05:54.529
Wow, very nice, in front of
kids. Charming.

01:05:54.612 --> 01:05:56.322
Yeah, it takes one to know one,
jackass.

01:05:57.614 --> 01:05:58.823
Don't lose your temper.

01:05:59.281 --> 01:06:02.033
What's that? What's that?
What's that?

01:06:02.116 --> 01:06:04.451
You wait till I walk out till
say anything. That's courage.

01:06:04.534 --> 01:06:06.118
We'll have a discussion.
Come back in here.

01:06:06.201 --> 01:06:10.413
I'm not afraid of you.
You did disgusting things.

01:06:10.496 --> 01:06:11.788
You have the nerve to walk
around in public.

01:06:11.871 --> 01:06:13.956
And... and you're... and
you're a perfect person?

01:06:14.088 --> 01:06:16.408
You're my judge? You're my
judge? What rabbi told you that?

01:06:16.433 --> 01:06:17.725
I didn't do what you did.

01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:18.934
What rabbi taught you
that you're my judge?

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:21.144
You're fine, you talk to God
and you work out your problems

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.020
but stay out of the public eye.
That's the difference.

01:06:23.103 --> 01:06:25.438
I'm-I'm not gonna stay with-
That's not for you to judge, my friend.

01:06:25.521 --> 01:06:27.773
I don't take my judgment for you
and I don't judge you.

01:06:27.856 --> 01:06:28.815
You're a bad example
for the people.

01:06:28.898 --> 01:06:29.940
That's your judgment?

01:06:30.023 --> 01:06:31.144
- No, that's obvious.
- Okay.

01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:33.859
That's why we have elections.
That's why we have elections.

01:06:33.942 --> 01:06:35.234
And you're perfect.
You're gonna judge me.

01:06:35.317 --> 01:06:36.234
I'm not running for office.

01:06:36.317 --> 01:06:37.568
You know who judges me?

01:06:37.651 --> 01:06:39.986
You know who judges me?
You know who judges me?

01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:42.446
Go visit with your rabbi.
Go visit with your rabbi.

01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:43.863
Shows you how much you know.

01:06:43.946 --> 01:06:44.988
Think about your wife.

01:06:45.071 --> 01:06:47.573
Friend, how could you take
the person you most

01:06:47.656 --> 01:06:50.075
closest to you and trusts you...

01:06:50.158 --> 01:06:51.951
Why didn't he just walk away?

01:06:52.034 --> 01:06:54.286
Why did we need that?
It was going nicely.

01:06:54.869 --> 01:06:56.537
You know who judges me?

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.039
You have shown no sign you're superior
to me and you are not my god.

01:06:59.122 --> 01:07:01.040
You know nothing.
You know nothing.

01:07:01.123 --> 01:07:03.333
Your ignorance is being shown
to the entire world.

01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:06.043
Anthony Weiner
in an epic war of words.

01:07:06.126 --> 01:07:09.045
Anthony Weiner had a meltdown
on the campaign trail.

01:07:09.128 --> 01:07:11.630
Weiner got in a shouting
match with a voter.

01:07:11.713 --> 01:07:14.173
You know who judges me?
You know who judges me?

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:20.136
The voters of New York City?

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:23.848
I've seen that tape
either online

01:07:23.931 --> 01:07:25.140
or on television, you know

01:07:25.223 --> 01:07:27.058
a 100 times and it's not
even about sex.

01:07:27.141 --> 01:07:29.059
Why exactly is this
such big news?

01:07:32.437 --> 01:07:34.517
Terrible shot, I got like,
right at the back of my...

01:07:34.563 --> 01:07:37.023
Bald spot?
It does not look great.

01:07:37.106 --> 01:07:41.151
Weiner begins to leave the bakery,
but then, listen closely.

01:07:42.902 --> 01:07:47.072
This man, Saul Kessler,
makes a racial slur about

01:07:47.155 --> 01:07:49.240
Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin.

01:07:49.323 --> 01:07:51.950
Oh!

01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:53.576
Well, then yeah, that guy.

01:07:55.077 --> 01:07:56.870
I didn't know that.

01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:02.708
What do you think?

01:08:02.791 --> 01:08:05.043
I don't know, I...

01:08:05.126 --> 01:08:06.377
You regret it?

01:08:09.046 --> 01:08:11.298
This is a nasty jackass.

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:16.109
Has anyone ever told you
it's hard to get

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:17.375
you to talk about your feelings?

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.932
Let me ask you something.
Are there any...

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:25.600
There must be some specie of fly
that stays on the wall and talks.

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:27.185
But I've never heard of one.

01:08:27.268 --> 01:08:31.313
Usually, is... is the fly on the
wall technique, isn't that have

01:08:31.395 --> 01:08:34.857
to do a little bit with the notion
of not being seen or heard?

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:37.108
You just kinda pick up
what goes on around you?

01:08:45.323 --> 01:08:49.036
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:08:51.537 --> 01:08:55.122
DJ Anthony Weiner on this phat
ride all night long.

01:08:57.832 --> 01:09:00.209
I thought
my political career was dead.

01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:04.629
And I was somewhat liberated
as well but

01:09:04.712 --> 01:09:08.256
liberation in a very Death Row
kinda way to it.

01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:12.135
Anybody here from Granada?

01:09:13.343 --> 01:09:15.845
Anybody here from Barbados?

01:09:15.928 --> 01:09:18.971
Anybody here from Jamaica?

01:09:28.145 --> 01:09:31.107
Thanks for coming out.

01:09:33.192 --> 01:09:36.319

by your man back in the 90s,
but is Hillary Clinton now

01:10:23.183 --> 01:10:24.517
changing her tune a little bit?

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.560
Rumor has it the likely
presidential contender's

01:10:26.643 --> 01:10:29.896
demanding her top aide Huma
Abedin drop her own

01:10:29.979 --> 01:10:32.106
lying cheating husband
Anthony Weiner.

01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:34.316
PIX 11's Mary Murphy caught up
with Anthony Weiner

01:10:34.399 --> 01:10:35.691
this afternoon. Hey, Mary.

01:10:35.774 --> 01:10:37.484
Hi, Tamsen and Scott.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:40.486
New York Magazine
is suggesting that Weiner's wife

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.070
is being asked to make a choice

01:10:42.153 --> 01:10:45.531
Hillary for president,
or Weiner as husband.

01:10:45.614 --> 01:10:48.283
We tried race walking
with mayoral candidate

01:10:48.366 --> 01:10:50.493
Anthony Weiner to get
a direct answer.

01:10:50.576 --> 01:10:53.787
Do you think that your wife will
choose to stay with you over

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:55.955
helping Hillary Clinton
get elected president?

01:10:56.038 --> 01:10:59.124
Look, I know there's been
a lot of damage done

01:10:59.207 --> 01:11:02.127
collateral damage because of the decisions
I've made in my private life...

01:11:02.167 --> 01:11:04.711
You're not answering
the question.

01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:07.129
And I'm gonna do the
very best I can.

01:11:07.212 --> 01:11:09.964
Do you think your wife
will choose you?

01:11:10.047 --> 01:11:11.423
- Can I get my answer here?
- I'm sorry.

01:11:11.506 --> 01:11:14.050
But as far as Huma goes,
she's one of the most talented

01:11:14.133 --> 01:11:16.301
people I've ever known
in... in public life

01:11:16.384 --> 01:11:18.135
And I think anyone who's ever
worked with her knows that.

01:11:18.319 --> 01:11:20.946
Do you think they should ask her
to make that kind of a choice?

01:11:21.029 --> 01:11:22.405
I really gotta go.

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:26.157
Huma, are you joining
this campaign stop?

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.450
I have to leave soon.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:30.331
You are joining. No?

01:11:30.409 --> 01:11:32.244
I have to get on with Philippe.

01:11:32.327 --> 01:11:34.329
- Okay, you have to telephone.
- Yeah.

01:11:34.412 --> 01:11:35.333
- You know that?
- Yeah.

01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:38.331
You know telephones work all
around nowadays.

01:11:38.414 --> 01:11:39.331
Be out in the car.

01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:43.309
I don't know if it's a good
idea or not.

01:11:43.334 --> 01:11:44.209
Like let me talk to Philippe.

01:11:44.292 --> 01:11:46.210
I don't have any like,
I have no prep.

01:11:46.293 --> 01:11:48.295
- He's gonna be a no.
- But I don't have any prep.

01:11:48.378 --> 01:11:50.671
For what? To whom?

01:11:50.754 --> 01:11:52.130
The press. Is the press
gonna be there?

01:11:52.213 --> 01:11:53.297
I'll give you...
I'll give you some prep.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.741
I'll give you some prep
in the car.

01:11:56.382 --> 01:11:57.716
You don't know anything.

01:11:58.133 --> 01:12:01.469
Well, I would say you act
like a normal campaign candidate's wife.

01:12:01.552 --> 01:12:03.345
I think Anthony's doing an
amazing job.

01:12:03.428 --> 01:12:06.389
It's great to be out here.
I said I would.

01:12:16.524 --> 01:12:18.484
Do my personal relationships
suffer because of

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:21.444
the superficial and
transactional nature of

01:12:21.527 --> 01:12:23.445
my political relationships or is
it the other way around?

01:12:23.528 --> 01:12:27.406
Do you go into politics because
it's... you're not connecting

01:12:27.489 --> 01:12:31.242
on that other level and... and
did the technology that undid me

01:12:31.325 --> 01:12:35.787
allow me to be in touch with people and have
kind of more superficial relationships?

01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:38.372
You know, I don't... I don't...
I don't know.

01:12:38.455 --> 01:12:40.331
I mean, look, it gets back to
the very premise, you know

01:12:40.414 --> 01:12:44.751
politicians probably are wired
in some way that needs...

01:12:44.834 --> 01:12:49.296
needs attention,
but I don't, uh, you know

01:12:49.379 --> 01:12:52.507
I'm not... I'm not blaming
that for sure.

01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:55.384
Um, but I don't...
I think it is...

01:12:55.467 --> 01:12:58.595
it is hard to have, uh

01:12:58.678 --> 01:13:01.347
it is... it is hard to have
normal relationships.

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:07.311
I've waged a campaign focused
like a laser beam on fighting

01:13:07.394 --> 01:13:09.474
for the middle class and those
struggling to make it.

01:13:09.479 --> 01:13:11.397
I've published two books
of new ideas.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.399
A 125 of them, in fact, on
everything from restoring

01:13:14.482 --> 01:13:18.027
discipline in our schools to creating
a single payer health plan for our city.

01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:25.383
Are you gonna do this?
Oh, I thought you were.

01:13:25.408 --> 01:13:26.659
I'm not in this ad.

01:13:29.453 --> 01:13:30.412
Really?

01:13:30.495 --> 01:13:34.207
Do I look like... do I look like
I'm camera ready?

01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:36.500
If you are absolutely not
gonna do anything more for

01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:39.377
the campaign, then yeah, then...
then there's then... then start now.

01:13:42.054 --> 01:13:43.855
You should... you want me to
start, start now.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.048
But if... if there's a chance
you're... you're gonna want to

01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:47.632
at some point do it, then let's
go ahead and take that.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:50.509
And it's gonna take 10 minutes.
We could have been done by now.

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:53.595
It will cause a firestorm,
but this like the first ad

01:13:53.678 --> 01:13:56.138
it gets out and I'm in it and
then it's a story

01:13:56.221 --> 01:13:57.305
and then we gotta
deal with it and

01:13:57.388 --> 01:13:58.514
Forget it. Forget it.
Let's just drop it.

01:13:58.597 --> 01:14:00.223
Like, why is that worth it?

01:14:00.306 --> 01:14:01.515
Ah, let's go.

01:14:05.934 --> 01:14:07.435
I just think it's a huge risk.

01:14:07.518 --> 01:14:10.354
Alright, ladies, thank you.

01:14:10.437 --> 01:14:12.564
Anthony.

01:14:12.647 --> 01:14:13.814
And action.

01:14:13.897 --> 01:14:16.441
I've waged a campaign that's
focused like a laser beam

01:14:16.524 --> 01:14:19.443
on fighting for the middle class
and those struggling to make it.

01:14:19.526 --> 01:14:21.444
Powerful voices made it clear
from the very beginning

01:14:21.527 --> 01:14:24.613
that they didn't want me to get
to... to... to...

01:14:24.696 --> 01:14:26.531
It's really apocalyptic
right now.

01:14:26.614 --> 01:14:28.532
I'm not really sure
if the sun's gonna continue

01:14:28.615 --> 01:14:30.408
to rotate around the earth.

01:14:30.491 --> 01:14:35.496
Hello, my name's Anthony Weiner.
Want a chicken? Every pot.

01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:43.545
Powerful voices have made it clear from the
very beginning they didn't want me to win.

01:14:43.628 --> 01:14:45.504
But this isn't about
what they want.

01:14:45.587 --> 01:14:47.589
They've gotten their way
for far too long.

01:14:47.672 --> 01:14:49.340
If you give me the chance,
I will fight

01:14:49.423 --> 01:14:52.175
for you and your family
every single day.

01:14:56.304 --> 01:14:57.513
Good?

01:14:59.181 --> 01:15:00.557
Cut.

01:15:02.433 --> 01:15:05.352
Okay.

01:15:05.435 --> 01:15:07.019
Honey, I'm gonna leave.

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:09.604
Leave a few minutes after I
leave before you leave.

01:15:09.687 --> 01:15:11.397
'Cause someone might think
you're married to me.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:12.981
Don't worry.

01:15:44.219 --> 01:15:47.013
Do you think Huma will come out
on the campaign trail

01:15:47.096 --> 01:15:48.256
between now and election day?

01:15:48.305 --> 01:15:50.015
Will she be by your side
on election night?

01:15:50.098 --> 01:15:54.519
I don't know. I mean, you know, I'm...
I'm walking a fine line.

01:15:54.602 --> 01:15:56.687
You know, you have, as a
reporter, you have

01:15:56.770 --> 01:16:00.023
an appetite for
the Huma side of the story.

01:16:00.106 --> 01:16:01.732
I want to talk about issues
important to the middle class

01:16:01.815 --> 01:16:03.483
and the issues that
citizens care about.

01:16:03.566 --> 01:16:06.735
Fair enough, but Huma was
a key part of your roll out.

01:16:06.818 --> 01:16:10.279
She spoke on your behalf
quite passionately

01:16:10.362 --> 01:16:12.530
the moment the second
wave of scandal.

01:16:12.613 --> 01:16:15.616
The media didn't put Huma into
this. You and Huma put Huma...

01:16:15.699 --> 01:16:16.866
I know, you're asking,
where she'll be in the future.

01:16:16.949 --> 01:16:18.450
And I answered your question.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.465
Did you want to come
with or not?

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.427
Yeah, I'm... I'm on the way now

01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:41.595
but it's on the day
books for 9:30.

01:16:43.722 --> 01:16:45.932
He... he's saying...
he's saying don't?

01:16:46.015 --> 01:16:50.060
Philippe said that?
Okay. Alright. See you soon.

01:16:59.569 --> 01:17:02.530
Here, let me handle this one alone.
I gotta go upstairs alone.

01:17:02.613 --> 01:17:04.531
I'll... I'll...
I'll come back down.

01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:26.010
It's my last race.
Running finally, y'know...

01:17:26.093 --> 01:17:28.637
It's my dream to run for mayor,
and...

01:17:30.096 --> 01:17:32.973
I also want him
to see us together.

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:34.516
We'll do it later. We'll...
we'll... I... it'll be fine.

01:17:34.599 --> 01:17:37.810
Alright, give me a kiss.

01:17:37.893 --> 01:17:40.437
IPad? Alright, Jordan

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.231
do you want to get in the
stroller or you wanna walk?

01:17:43.314 --> 01:17:46.900
Stroller? It's all wet.
Did you say all wet?

01:17:46.983 --> 01:17:48.567
You wanna push? Okay.

01:17:55.841 --> 01:17:58.510
Hey, I've got a fairly brilliant
idea. What if I say this?

01:17:58.593 --> 01:18:01.470
You know, they... they lost my
name in the... in the books.

01:18:01.553 --> 01:18:03.680
They can't find it, so we've
been running around

01:18:03.763 --> 01:18:05.681
trying to figure out
how to fix it.

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:08.308
What if I just say
at 9:30 work on

01:18:08.391 --> 01:18:10.643
Huma's schedule unfortunately
she has a work conflict now

01:18:10.726 --> 01:18:13.645
and she couldn't do it, once we
had this de-delay, you know

01:18:13.728 --> 01:18:16.772
we had this delay because of the problems
at the Board of Elections?

01:18:16.855 --> 01:18:17.772
What about that?

01:18:20.816 --> 01:18:24.152
Okay. Uh, it's a... it's...
it sounds like a duck.

01:18:24.235 --> 01:18:26.862
Hi. Alright,
I'll talk to you later.

01:18:29.823 --> 01:18:32.742
Beep, beep, coming through.

01:18:32.825 --> 01:18:34.368
Beep, beep, coming through.

01:18:35.994 --> 01:18:37.745
Josh, you're killing me, buddy.

01:18:37.828 --> 01:18:39.663
Josh, get out of the shot.

01:18:39.746 --> 01:18:41.664
Josh, get out of the shot.

01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:48.169
Anthony, you seemed pretty upset at the
NBC interview about your wife's absence.

01:18:48.252 --> 01:18:50.087
Does it say anything to us?
What absence?

01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:51.838
Her absence and not being
here today or recently.

01:18:51.921 --> 01:18:53.839
Oh, no, this was... this
happened because

01:18:53.922 --> 01:18:55.715
of the same thing every...
when we had it

01:18:55.798 --> 01:18:56.882
at 9:30 it was around her
schedule.

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:59.676
When it became 10:30 it became
problematic for her schedule.

01:18:59.759 --> 01:19:01.844
She's gonna be voting. I'm pretty
sure she's gonna vote for me too.

01:19:01.927 --> 01:19:03.511
Alright, guys, we gotta go.

01:19:03.594 --> 01:19:04.636
Um, we're gonna go that way. Is
that okay? Sorry, buddy.

01:19:04.719 --> 01:19:07.638
Can we just do the one question?
We'll all get out of your way.

01:19:07.721 --> 01:19:09.761
1 question? I've just done...
I've done 40 questions

01:19:09.764 --> 01:19:11.474
and now you're dealing
with a 20 month old.

01:19:11.557 --> 01:19:14.557
Get your wife's absence, you seem
pretty agitated. You seemed upset by it.

01:19:14.559 --> 01:19:17.812
No, no, it's just... it's just 7 or 8
or 9 questions on the same subject.

01:19:17.895 --> 01:19:19.313
After a certain point,
I think, well

01:19:19.396 --> 01:19:21.689
a question being asked again
and again, you know, so.

01:19:21.772 --> 01:19:23.857
Her absence,
does it say anything?

01:19:45.377 --> 01:19:47.754
Alright, thumbs up. Thumbs...

01:19:48.921 --> 01:19:50.213
Thumbs up.

01:20:05.895 --> 01:20:08.689
The craziest part of the
whole Anthony Weiner thing is

01:20:08.772 --> 01:20:10.774
the guy never met you
face to face.

01:20:10.857 --> 01:20:12.108
No. He never met me.

01:20:12.191 --> 01:20:16.445
Had more contact with him
already. Are you angry with him?

01:20:16.528 --> 01:20:18.655
I think I am a little bit
angry angry with him.

01:20:18.738 --> 01:20:21.657
What pissed me off was
him on the campaign trail saying

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:22.782
"Oh, I've changed."

01:20:22.865 --> 01:20:25.158
And trying to act like he has
this perfect marriage now

01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:26.450
and everything's just peachy.

01:20:26.533 --> 01:20:27.909
- The hypocrisy got to you?
- Yeah.

01:20:27.992 --> 01:20:31.120
I was like, bullshit. I am proof
that you have not changed.

01:20:31.203 --> 01:20:34.039
You know what I... I
fantasize about actually.

01:20:34.122 --> 01:20:36.666
If you did go to confront him.

01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:38.417
I... I think we should.
Let's do it.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.251
I'd be like Carlos Danger.

01:20:40.334 --> 01:20:42.210
- Meet Mrs. Danger.
- Meet Mrs. Danger.

01:20:42.293 --> 01:20:43.794
Yeah, that would be perfect.

01:20:43.877 --> 01:20:45.557
- I'm ready to do it.
- I'm ready to do it.

01:20:50.731 --> 01:20:53.651
Sorry to bother you right now,
but this requires your immediate attention.

01:20:53.676 --> 01:20:55.094
Pineapple is at the office.

01:20:55.555 --> 01:20:57.195
Sydney Leathers is
in front of the office.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.555
- Alone?
- No. With media and signs.

01:20:59.638 --> 01:21:00.555
With how many media?

01:21:00.638 --> 01:21:01.759
I don't know how many media.

01:21:01.805 --> 01:21:04.182
I'm giving you the tick-tock
of my plan right now.

01:21:04.265 --> 01:21:05.474
We'll drive on 48th...

01:21:05.557 --> 01:21:06.766
What media is there?

01:21:06.849 --> 01:21:09.017
I... I... Camille just called me.
I don't have any update.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.561
I literally just ran here to give you
the tick-tock of my plan.

01:21:12.644 --> 01:21:14.854
My... my plan...
This is the tick-tock for my plan...

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:16.688
I'm not going, I shouldn't go.

01:21:17.021 --> 01:21:17.771
You don't want...?
Well, the phone bank...

01:21:17.854 --> 01:21:18.771
Just avoid the scene.

01:21:18.854 --> 01:21:20.772
The phone bank is at the office.

01:21:20.855 --> 01:21:22.656
Yeah, well, what's... well...
avoid the scene.

01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:24.941
Why... why try to play it cute?

01:21:25.858 --> 01:21:27.734
Okay, but if you do want to go
to the office,

01:21:27.817 --> 01:21:31.070
I do have a whole
entire plan ready for you.

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.158
- Andrew.
- Hold on... hold on, hold on.

01:21:36.241 --> 01:21:39.077
Bo... Bo... Boss wants to talk to me.
Just hold on the line.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.452
Okay, you know what I would do?

01:21:40.535 --> 01:21:42.787
I would get phone bankers
with signs.

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.997
If there's any press attention
to her at all

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.956
surround her and chant
the shit out of her.

01:21:47.039 --> 01:21:48.915
Okay.

01:21:48.998 --> 01:21:51.792
But that's only if there is...
only if there is attention.

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:54.586
If she's not getting any
attention, then just let it go.

01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:57.880
But if she starts to then circle
her and just chant the shit.

01:21:57.963 --> 01:22:00.966
No physical contact and I'd
chant the shit out of her.

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:03.926
- Jordan.
- Alright, thank you.

01:22:04.009 --> 01:22:04.801
Alright, Bye-bye.

01:22:04.884 --> 01:22:07.928
Can you tell me what's going on?

01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:10.763
Pineapple's in front
of the office.

01:22:10.846 --> 01:22:12.013
Who's... can you...

01:22:12.096 --> 01:22:13.889
Syd... Sydney Leathers
is in front...

01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:15.765
Oh, shit. I shouldn't have
said that on the camera.

01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:16.974
- Why not?
- I'm sorry.

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:18.178
'Cause that's our code word.

01:22:18.182 --> 01:22:19.808
- Oh.
- But...

01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:24.770
Sydney Leathers is outside of
597 Fifth Avenue right now.

01:22:24.853 --> 01:22:29.774
Uh, we are staying calm and
managing the situation right now.

01:22:29.857 --> 01:22:34.236
I have two contingency plans
in place if A... Anthony

01:22:34.319 --> 01:22:36.112
absolutely needs to get to the
office.

01:22:36.195 --> 01:22:39.948
But I also need to develop
a... a backup plan.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.328
It's my job to make sure she
fucking fails at life today.

01:22:59.884 --> 01:23:01.385
I gotta wonder...

01:23:07.516 --> 01:23:09.935
if I had more time,
could I rebound again.

01:23:11.914 --> 01:23:13.954
Even when things we thought
were going pretty well

01:23:13.979 --> 01:23:16.898
we still were dealing with
puns and the nastiness

01:23:16.981 --> 01:23:19.024
and like the outrage
of the editorial pages.

01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:23.069
Why do you think that is?

01:23:25.321 --> 01:23:27.090
I lied to them.

01:23:27.548 --> 01:23:29.049
I've got a funny name.

01:23:32.635 --> 01:23:33.677
And, uh...

01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:41.642
They don't...
They don't do nuance.

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:45.645
Headline writers and editorial pages -
they're the opposite of nuance.

01:23:46.979 --> 01:23:50.357
They all like to say that the lying
was sort of the big thing.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.649
You think that's true?

01:23:54.026 --> 01:23:57.446
I've had this conversation with
myself recently where I'm...

01:24:00.073 --> 01:24:02.116
I need to visualize...

01:24:08.956 --> 01:24:10.916
how different it would've been.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:13.125
Not very.

01:24:14.376 --> 01:24:18.797
They've... They've got the comfort
of being able to...

01:24:20.924 --> 01:24:22.550
Righteously vilify you.

01:24:28.722 --> 01:24:31.099
The results have not yet
been certified

01:24:31.182 --> 01:24:34.059
but Bill de Blasio appears
to have 40% of the vote.

01:24:34.142 --> 01:24:37.520
Second place finisher
Bill Thompson has 26%.

01:24:37.603 --> 01:24:42.149
Anthony Weiner
with 4.93% of the vote

01:24:42.232 --> 01:24:45.735
in the Democratic primary
for Mayor. So it's over.

01:24:45.818 --> 01:24:48.028
This is Anthony Weiner.
How are you, my friend?

01:24:48.111 --> 01:24:50.488
Congratulations.
You ran a great campaign.

01:24:51.322 --> 01:24:55.034
Somebody just emailed me to tell me that
this woman's actually inside the party?

01:24:55.117 --> 01:24:57.119
She's downstairs.

01:24:57.202 --> 01:24:58.328
Yeah.

01:24:58.411 --> 01:25:01.038
We have a security detail
on her.

01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:04.124
Sydney, what are you going to
say if Anthony Weiner walks

01:25:04.207 --> 01:25:06.083
through this door about
10 feet away from you?

01:25:06.166 --> 01:25:08.168
Well, I guess you'll see
with your eyes.

01:25:09.836 --> 01:25:11.963
- Fuck.
- Yeah, she's downstairs.

01:25:14.799 --> 01:25:20.012
We can sneak you in through McDonalds and into
the staircase upstairs. She'll never know.

01:25:20.095 --> 01:25:22.055
- Okay.
- We discreetly pull up.

01:25:22.138 --> 01:25:25.432
I'm... I'm budgeting 12 seconds
from car to door.

01:25:27.183 --> 01:25:28.309
Okay.

01:25:28.392 --> 01:25:30.560
Okay. Everyone... can
everyone leave except for Huma?

01:25:30.643 --> 01:25:32.102
And Huma, come in.

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:35.313
This woman is in the bar.

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:39.733
I'm not going to face the indignity
of being accosted by this woman.

01:25:39.816 --> 01:25:41.025
She's not in the venue.

01:25:41.108 --> 01:25:42.901
You think that's how
anyone's going to cover it?

01:25:42.984 --> 01:25:44.402
What do you want to do?

01:25:59.431 --> 01:26:01.351
Can we get a picture with
you? Is that alright?

01:26:01.376 --> 01:26:02.585
Can somebody take a...

01:26:08.547 --> 01:26:10.215
Are you okay?

01:26:19.056 --> 01:26:20.098
Sure?

01:26:23.392 --> 01:26:24.768
Josh, come on.

01:26:30.297 --> 01:26:32.458
You do have to move quickly
when we get out of the car.

01:26:32.483 --> 01:26:34.276
We can't linger around.

01:26:36.611 --> 01:26:38.195
Where's Pineapple now?

01:26:42.824 --> 01:26:44.909
We're executing
the McDonald's plan.

01:26:47.912 --> 01:26:50.080
Like, he cannot be that
afraid of me. Like seriously.

01:26:50.163 --> 01:26:51.998
What is he so afraid of?

01:26:52.331 --> 01:26:53.957
Turn the lights off, Anthony.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.240
We'll be there in 45 seconds.

01:26:57.834 --> 01:26:59.293
Huma. Huma.

01:27:00.377 --> 01:27:02.253
Don't come. Go home.

01:27:03.379 --> 01:27:04.546
Here we go.

01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:06.088
No, you can't call me
back in 5 minutes.

01:27:09.299 --> 01:27:14.637
Now. Now, now,
now, now, now, now, now.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.263
Are you serious?

01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:24.270
Hey, guys, welcome to New York.

01:27:29.233 --> 01:27:30.234
Where am I going?

01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:43.286
Are you serious?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, my god.

01:27:47.498 --> 01:27:50.250
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Have we lost her?

01:27:50.333 --> 01:27:54.211
Seriously? All to avoid
a 23 year old, really?

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:08.473
We might have come up a little short
in this campaign.

01:28:08.556 --> 01:28:11.392
But we are all unified
in that fight.

01:28:11.475 --> 01:28:14.269
If you keep fighting, I'm gonna
keep fighting.

01:28:14.352 --> 01:28:16.145
Because we're gonna
keep New York the capital

01:28:16.228 --> 01:28:18.271
of the middle class
for years to come.

01:28:18.354 --> 01:28:20.564
Thank you very much
and God bless you.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.657
What's the plan for tomorrow?
What's the plan for tomorrow, Anthony?

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.450
Don't push me!

01:28:47.087 --> 01:28:49.047
Oh my God!

01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:50.881
As he rushed into a car

01:28:50.964 --> 01:28:53.591
Weiner's security team
scuffled with reporters.

01:28:53.674 --> 01:28:57.386
The candidate's response?
A raised middle finger

01:28:57.469 --> 01:28:59.012
through the car window.

01:29:05.393 --> 01:29:07.194
I can't believe I gave
the press the finger.

01:29:09.896 --> 01:29:13.441
I still have this virtually
unlimited ability

01:29:13.524 --> 01:29:16.693
to fuck up things day by day.

01:29:20.279 --> 01:29:23.031
Why have you let me film this?

01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:33.290
- I, Bill de Blasio...
- I, Bill de Blasio...

01:29:33.373 --> 01:29:36.125
- do solemnly swear...
- do solemnly swear...

01:29:36.208 --> 01:29:38.418
that I will support the constitution
of the state of New York...

01:29:38.501 --> 01:29:41.670
that I will support the constitution
of the state of New York...

01:29:41.753 --> 01:29:43.393
and the charter
of the city of New York.

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.547
And the charter
of the city of New York.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:47.548
That I will
faithfully discharge...

01:29:47.631 --> 01:29:49.841
That I will
faithfully discharge...

01:29:49.924 --> 01:29:52.760
the duties of the office
of the mayor of the city of New York.

01:29:52.843 --> 01:29:55.637
The duties of the office
of the mayor of the city of New York.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:56.887
So help me God.

01:29:56.970 --> 01:29:58.888
So help me God.

01:30:08.438 --> 01:30:10.273
The scandal has been reduced

01:30:10.356 --> 01:30:13.192
ad absurdum.

01:30:13.275 --> 01:30:16.861
The laws of entertainment
gravity are gonna suck the..

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:20.238
The documentary
into the same vortex.

01:30:20.321 --> 01:30:22.364
What do you mean?

01:30:22.447 --> 01:30:25.241
The same things
that people want and

01:30:25.425 --> 01:30:27.385
were intrigued by
and fascinated by

01:30:27.468 --> 01:30:30.387
and titillated by, it's

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:33.473
as much as you may want
to tell a story

01:30:33.556 --> 01:30:36.350
it's still gonna be
the same frame

01:30:36.433 --> 01:30:39.060
of the same..

01:30:39.143 --> 01:30:41.395
Thing, but...

01:30:41.478 --> 01:30:43.605
I don't know,
I don't... I don't regret

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:45.815
letting you follow me around
and kinda

01:30:45.898 --> 01:30:47.816
documenting some of it.

01:30:47.899 --> 01:30:49.609
Um..

01:30:50.693 --> 01:30:52.319
I guess 'cause
I just think that it...

01:30:52.402 --> 01:30:53.611
I mean, I would hope
that it's more

01:30:53.694 --> 01:30:57.239
than just a punch line
kind of thing.

01:30:57.322 --> 01:31:00.325
I wanted just to viewed
as the... as the full person

01:31:00.408 --> 01:31:01.575
that I was.

01:31:01.658 --> 01:31:05.495
And I can't believe my entire..

01:31:05.578 --> 01:31:06.495
Everything is being engulfed

01:31:06.578 --> 01:31:09.038
by this... by this thing.

01:31:09.121 --> 01:31:10.321
And maybe that's what happens.

01:31:10.371 --> 01:31:12.122
You know, I mean..

01:31:12.205 --> 01:31:14.446
It's kind of like, you know,
besides that Mrs. Lincoln

01:31:14.456 --> 01:31:15.373
that was the show.

01:31:15.456 --> 01:31:17.583
You know, maybe,
that was naive too.

01:31:28.031 --> 01:31:30.151
You know there's a tendency,
and we do it for a living

01:31:30.176 --> 01:31:32.344
guys like us,
to try to figure out

01:31:32.427 --> 01:31:33.548
like what the meta viewpoint

01:31:33.594 --> 01:31:35.512
we're all supposed
to have of this.

01:31:38.473 --> 01:31:40.558
So hold on a sec,
hold on a second.

01:31:40.641 --> 01:31:42.351
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

01:31:42.434 --> 01:31:44.554
Hold on. The only... the only
point I'm making, Herman

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.881
I'm trying
to make a nuanced point

01:31:45.894 --> 01:31:47.353
about a complicated situation

01:31:47.436 --> 01:31:49.479
that you and your party
are trying to over simplify

01:31:49.562 --> 01:31:50.521
by saying the President
is doing nothing.

01:31:50.604 --> 01:31:52.147
- Nothing.
- 1600...

01:31:55.107 --> 01:31:57.943
The next generation
of politicians act differently

01:31:58.026 --> 01:32:00.695
because their entire lives
will be documented

01:32:00.778 --> 01:32:03.155
on some sort of online platform.

01:32:03.238 --> 01:32:05.531
I think that's already, I think
we all... I mean, after...

01:32:05.614 --> 01:32:07.490
Oh, look at the time.
I gotta get going.

01:32:15.498 --> 01:32:18.250
- Oh my...
- Hey, buddy.

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:19.625
Oh, my God.

01:32:21.906 --> 01:32:23.227
Hey, can I get a picture
with you?

01:32:23.252 --> 01:32:25.420
Sure, let me just finish
with this guy.

01:32:25.503 --> 01:32:27.129
Head this way.

01:32:28.505 --> 01:32:30.548
That's it.
Hold it right there. Good.

01:32:35.135 --> 01:32:37.303
Mom, mom, mom

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:39.429
guess who I am standing
in front of?

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:41.555
Anthony Weiner,
right across from my school.

01:32:41.638 --> 01:32:43.848
Mom, I'm... Mom, you're right.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.600
Yeah, I want to see your Wikipedia.

01:32:46.749 --> 01:32:48.910
Please don't. I would
encourage you not to, actually.

01:32:48.935 --> 01:32:50.436
What?
What is that supposed to mean?

01:32:50.519 --> 01:32:52.103
The written word is dead.

01:32:52.186 --> 01:32:53.687
- Oh, my God.
- You got it, champ?

01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:54.979
- Yeah. Oh, my God.
- Very nice to meet you.

01:32:55.062 --> 01:32:57.481
Okay. Oh, my God!
