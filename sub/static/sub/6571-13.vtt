00:01.968 --> 00:05.404
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.421
<i>Michael Bluth had gotten up early...</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:25.514
<i>in the hopes of avoiding his family.</i>

00:25.625 --> 00:29.652
<i>His mother, however, was already dressed,</i>
<i>made up and waiting for him</i>-

00:29.763 --> 00:31.856
- <i>Good morning.</i>
- Ooh!

00:31.965 --> 00:35.059
<i>Which put her wake-up time</i>
<i>in the 3:00, 3:30 area.</i>

00:35.168 --> 00:38.365
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>
<i>I always get this way before Motherboy.</i>

00:38.471 --> 00:40.701
Oh, God.
It's Motherboy already?

00:40.807 --> 00:45.073
<i>Motherboy was a dinner dance</i>
<i>aimed at promoting mother-son bonding.</i>

00:45.178 --> 00:48.705
<i>Lucille had gone</i>
<i>over 25 times with Buster...</i>

00:48.815 --> 00:52.342
<i>and on a few occasions,</i>
<i>had won Cutest Couple.</i>

00:52.452 --> 00:55.353
<i>As one entered sexual maturity,</i>
<i>and the other one left it...</i>

00:55.455 --> 00:57.389
<i>it became harder to win.</i>

00:57.490 --> 01:00.857
- I'm so hot.
- If you were hot, Mother, we would win.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.293
<i>It's not just Motherboy.</i>
<i>It's Motherboy XXX!</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:07.958
- And I think with you, I've got a shot.
- Oh, no.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.333
- Buster, for the first time ever,
doesn't want to do this?
- No, he does.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.565
It's just,
he's been so mopey.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.642
That could have something to do
with the fact that a seal ate his hand.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.541
- I don't know what it is.
- I think that's what it is.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.308
- Who knows?
- <i>It was that.</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:25.680
<i>It had happened weeks earlier when Buster</i>
<i>went swimming in the ocean...</i>

01:25.785 --> 01:29.448
<i>against his mother's wishes.</i>

01:29.556 --> 01:31.888
<i>He had become haunted by the loss...</i>

01:31.991 --> 01:35.791
<i>seeing reminders of the accident everywhere.</i>

<i>Mother, I can't sleep. I may not be able</i>
<i>to go to dance practice today.</i>

01:49.342 --> 01:51.139
I'm going out. Zip me up.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.303
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>look how he zips now.</i>

01:53.413 --> 01:56.041
I know what this is. You're embarrassed
by him, aren't you?

01:56.149 --> 01:58.083
You spent your whole life
over-mothering the guy...

01:58.184 --> 02:00.414
and when he finally needs you,
you're not there.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.420
Well, I don't see you
spending time with him.

02:02.522 --> 02:06.014
<i>The Bluth children had been</i>
<i>uneasy about missing limbs...</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:09.618
<i>since their father used a one-armed man</i>
<i>to teach them lessons.</i>

02:09.729 --> 02:12.163
That's why you don't yell.

02:12.265 --> 02:16.326
As a matter of fact, I'm going to see Buster today.

02:16.436 --> 02:19.428
So you're gonna have to find a different
dance partner for Motherboy.

02:19.539 --> 02:23.100
God. Not that "I'm in love
with my mother" dance thing.

02:23.209 --> 02:26.269
I'm so glad there wasn't one of
those for daddies and daughters.

02:26.379 --> 02:29.871
- Of course they have father-daughter dances.
- They do? He never took me?

02:29.983 --> 02:33.714
It was before we did your nose.
Toodle-oo.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.789
- You're up awful early.
- Well, my marriage is falling apart.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.792
- Tobias is back with Carl.
- <i>Tobias had gotten a call...</i>

02:40.894 --> 02:44.057
<i>from his one-time acting</i>
<i>teacher, Carl Weathers.</i>

02:44.164 --> 02:49.295
He's directing something for TV,
but he thinks he might have a part for me.

02:49.402 --> 02:53.805
<i>If this takes off, I might be able to buy you</i>
<i>the happiness that you deserve.</i>

02:53.907 --> 02:56.933
He said the same thing when he got cast as
Frightened Inmate Number Two...

02:57.043 --> 02:59.170
in that film he got fired from.

02:59.279 --> 03:03.238
<i>He had even gotten a vanity plate</i>
<i>made up announcing the achievement.</i>

03:03.349 --> 03:06.477
<i>And this wasn't the first time.</i>

03:09.789 --> 03:13.725
He's so clueless.
He's not your real "take charge" husband.

03:13.826 --> 03:16.818
Lindsay, you're still looking
for somebody like Daddy, okay?

03:16.930 --> 03:20.559
Let's not forget that he was also
dismissive and disinterested.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.658
No. No, he had good qualities.

03:22.769 --> 03:25.567
<i>Actually, George Sr. Was secretly living...</i>

03:25.672 --> 03:29.164
- <i>in the attic above them</i>
<i>and was starved for company</i>-
- Nellie.

03:29.275 --> 03:30.708
Now-

03:30.810 --> 03:33.335
who wants to take their top off?

03:33.446 --> 03:36.006
<i>when George Michael and Maeby came in.</i>

03:36.115 --> 03:39.243
<i>So you and Ann are actually going on</i>
<i>a Christian camping trip?</i>

03:39.352 --> 03:42.446
It's called the Promise Land.
You're supposed to make promises...

03:42.555 --> 03:46.719
about your relationship as a tribute to
the generations that preceded you.

03:46.826 --> 03:48.726
Hey, there's booze in this.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.296
That's the Promise Land
that Ann's taking you to?

03:51.397 --> 03:53.729
You're gonna need this
more than Polly here.

03:53.833 --> 03:58.202
- <i>That one's Polly?</i>
- Hey! What are you kids doin' up here?

03:58.304 --> 04:01.705
We're lookin' for the camping stuff. Do you
know where the pump is for the air mattress?

04:01.808 --> 04:05.209
I had to take all pumps
out of here a long time ago.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.108
Take this down to
the kitchen, will you?

04:07.213 --> 04:09.272
I think it's getting too risky
keeping you up here.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.044
You know what's risky?
Lettin' your son go on that church thing.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.551
Her name's Ann, Dad,
and he's not "going" on her, okay?

04:14.654 --> 04:16.553
- They're just friends.
- <i>Not for long.</i>

04:16.656 --> 04:18.647
They're making promises
to each other.

04:18.757 --> 04:22.489
It's all that fidelity and pledging
yourself to a woman garbage.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.063
<i>I wine 'em and dine 'em,</i>
<i>but I don't let 'em tell me what to do.</i>

04:25.164 --> 04:29.999
I don't... let 'em tell me...
what to do.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.639
<i>Okay, I should've never taken</i>
<i>the pumps out ofhere.</i>

04:33.740 --> 04:37.574
<i>Listen, unlike you,</i>
<i>I respect my son's choices.</i>

04:37.677 --> 04:41.306
<i>George Michael, I don't think you should</i>
<i>be going on this Promise Land thing.</i>

04:41.414 --> 04:43.075
What? Why?
Because I'd miss school?

04:43.182 --> 04:45.173
- No.
- You get to miss school for that?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.550
<i>And that's when Maeby decided</i>
<i>to become a devout Christian.</i>

04:48.655 --> 04:52.091
Do you guys know where I could get one of
those gold necklaces with the "T" on it?

04:52.191 --> 04:55.160
- That's a cross.
- Across from where?

04:55.261 --> 04:58.253
Um, it's not about school, pal.
It's more about family.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.424
<i>Your Uncle Buster's been very depressed</i>
<i>lately, and you haven't visited him.</i>

05:01.534 --> 05:05.994
<i>Family first. Or did they not teach you that</i>
<i>at the Promise Land?</i>

05:06.105 --> 05:08.869
- I don't know. You won't let me go.
- Attaboy.

05:11.544 --> 05:14.513
<i>Michael then went to the office,</i>
<i>where he ran into Gob.</i>

05:14.614 --> 05:18.141
Barry come by yet?
I need to talk to him about my divorce.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.742
<i>Gob had once</i>
<i>gotten married on a dare...</i>

05:20.853 --> 05:24.721
<i>a fact he'd only remembered</i>
<i>when he was served with divorce papers.</i>

05:24.824 --> 05:27.657
- That cow is going after me.
- Your wife? She was super-thin.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.159
- She was?
- Yeah.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.025
What about her cans?
She have big cans?

05:31.130 --> 05:33.997
- You don't remember her at all?
- It was one night of wild passion.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.627
- And yet you didn't notice her body.
- I like to look in the mirror.

05:37.737 --> 05:42.470
That would be disgusting if you'd actually
slept with her, but I don't think you did.

05:42.575 --> 05:46.409
- I did! And it <i>was</i> disgusting.
- <i>They didn't, but it would have been.</i>

05:46.512 --> 05:49.174
Anyway, remember that seal of hers
that I released into the ocean?

05:49.282 --> 05:51.182
- Bit off Buster's hand?
- Vaguely.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.151
Her lawyers are claiming
that the seal's worth 250 grand.

05:54.253 --> 05:56.153
And that's not even
including Buster's Swatch.

05:56.255 --> 06:00.055
Listen, Gob, if you admit in court that
you never consummated the marriage...

06:00.159 --> 06:02.354
you can get it annulled
and walk away free and clear.

06:02.462 --> 06:06.159
You just can't deal with the fact that I've got
a super-thin wife with huge cans.

06:06.265 --> 06:09.234
All right. Who's ready to show
their lawyer some love?

06:09.335 --> 06:12.304
<i>The seal?</i>
<i>Must've had a tracking device on it.</i>

06:12.405 --> 06:14.669
Someone tracked it all the way
to a dock in Dana Point.

06:14.774 --> 06:19.211
You know, if that hand is still intact inside
the seal, Buster's got a shot at a transplant.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.803
At the very least, we can get Buster's
Swatch back, right?

06:21.914 --> 06:23.882
Up top. No?

06:23.983 --> 06:25.551
<i>And Tobias met with</i>
<i>Carl Weathers at Burger King.</i>

06:25.551 --> 06:27.178
<i>And Tobias met with</i>
<i>Carl Weathers at Burger King.</i>

06:27.286 --> 06:29.083
Thanks for meeting me down here
at Burger King.

06:29.188 --> 06:32.316
I'm tryin' to get them to underwrite
a new TV project I'm workin' on.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.861
Get some money in exchange
for settin' a scene here in Burger King.

06:35.962 --> 06:38.453
As long as you
don't draw attention to it.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.431
I'm directing an episode
of the series <i>Scandal Makers.</i>

06:41.534 --> 06:44.697
It's about the Bluth family and your
father-in-law's escape from justice.

06:44.804 --> 06:47.864
- I play the lead- a bounty hunter, name of Ice.
- Oh, no.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.033
You want me to play myself,
don't you?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.043
I swore I'd not go reality.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.876
- I will do-
- No, I already got a great guy
named Dave Attell to play you.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.950
I wasn't actually here
to ask you to be in it.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.143
I'm lookin' for somebody
in your family to sign a release.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.214
I could not betray my family
like that.

07:04.323 --> 07:07.622
Come on, man. I've got every part cast
except for George Sr.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.890
- I want that part.
- Then sign over the rights.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.056
I'm gonna go get a new soda.

07:13.166 --> 07:18.263
Did you know that you can get a refill
on any drink you want here, and it's free?

07:18.371 --> 07:20.896
It's a wonderful restaurant.

07:21.007 --> 07:25.341
<i>It sure is. George Michael,</i>
<i>meanwhile, spent an afternoon...</i>

07:25.445 --> 07:28.141
- <i>with his uncle, at his father's suggestion.</i>
- King me.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.647
Oh, God! I keep forgetting about this.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.743
- Oh, me too.
- Well, that's a do-over. So, who should go first?

07:34.854 --> 07:36.754
I know.
Let's rock-paper-scissors for it.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.950
- No! You would've-You would've won that, so-
- Oh.

07:40.059 --> 07:44.257
George Michael- Buster, did you at least
offer your nephew a bowl of soup?

07:44.363 --> 07:46.331
Yes, Mother, I did.

07:46.432 --> 07:49.458
- Can I open a can of soup for you?
- Can it open a can?

07:49.569 --> 07:52.163
- Can what open a can? Oh, God!
- Oh, God!

07:52.271 --> 07:55.365
Actually, I just wanted to spend some time
with my Knuckle Buster.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.741
- See, Mother? Not everybody is afraid of me.
- Oh, my God!

07:59.846 --> 08:04.374
<i>Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending</i>
<i>some time with what's left of your uncle.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:08.545
I was supposed to go away to the Promise Land
this weekend, but my dad didn't want me to.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.646
- Family first.
- Well, you've done your duty this week.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.624
You're a very sympathetic
young man.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.456
Very sympathetic.
You know what?

08:18.564 --> 08:22.193
You deserve to go out of town this weekend,
and I'm taking you.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.498
Really?
George Michael should have realized...

08:25.605 --> 08:28.403
<i>by the sailor suit</i>
<i>Lucille dressed him in...</i>

08:28.508 --> 08:31.306
<i>that he wasn't going north</i>
<i>to the Promise Land.</i>

08:31.410 --> 08:35.312
I can't believe you don't know this song,
George Michael.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.905
No, he was going south.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.384
- <i>South to Motherboy.</i>

08:46.192 --> 08:50.185
<i>And Michael and Gob headed out</i>
<i>to find the seal with the tracking device.</i>

08:50.296 --> 08:53.891
I guess we should call Buster
and have him meet us at the dock, right?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.366
I guess so.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.263
Or we could make sure
it's the right seal first?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.206
- I mean, why get his hopes up?
- Yeah, that's better.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.277
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, God!

09:05.378 --> 09:07.039
- Monster!
- Hey, Brothers.

09:07.146 --> 09:08.841
- Buster.
- Bonster!

09:08.948 --> 09:11.246
- Sorry about the window.
- Not a problem.

09:11.350 --> 09:16.845
I really hate this stupid hook.
But I certainly can't walk around like this.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.856
- Why not?
- Very handsome.

09:18.958 --> 09:22.724
We were just gonna call you.
We think we know where the seal is.

09:22.828 --> 09:24.796
- The seal that did this to me?
- Yeah.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.058
- Take me!
- Yes. That's a good idea.

09:27.166 --> 09:30.158
I'm gonna go with Barry.
You should get in here. I'll just go with Barry.

09:30.269 --> 09:35.036
There's not enough room for you and me
and the stump and the thing- stuff. Barry!

09:35.141 --> 09:38.110
<i>Tobias had gotten his first speaking role...</i>

09:38.210 --> 09:42.078
<i>simply by signing away</i>
<i>the life rights of everyone he loved.</i>

09:42.181 --> 09:45.708
- <i>And now he needed some research.</i>
- I'm George Sr.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.946
Ooh, that's good.
That's the voice. I've got the voice.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.421
- <i>That's not my voice.</i>
- Oh, my God!

09:51.524 --> 09:54.425
- What are you doing here?
- I'm havin' a- tea party.

09:54.527 --> 09:59.464
What does it look like? I live here.
You tell anybody, you are dead.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.829
<i>Tobias saw the raw power of George Sr.</i>

10:01.934 --> 10:06.200
Stop licking my hand,
you horse's ass.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.900
<i>Apower he needed</i>
<i>the man to teach him.</i>
- That's it.

10:10.009 --> 10:14.309
<i>So he explained the project,</i>
<i>and George Sr. Agreed on one condition.</i>

10:14.413 --> 10:16.381
If you play me,
you gotta play me like a man...

10:16.482 --> 10:20.009
and not some mincing little
Polly or Nellie.

10:20.119 --> 10:24.078
I get those names confused.
Apologies. Apologies all around.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.992
<i>And the search</i>
<i>for Buster's hand continued.</i>

10:28.094 --> 10:30.426
I would love to be able
to say "Look what I've had reattached...

10:30.529 --> 10:33.396
while you and George Michael
were off to Motherboy."

10:33.499 --> 10:35.763
Motherboy? Wait a minute.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.768
Mom took him to Motherboy?

10:37.870 --> 10:42.534
He couldn't wait to swoop in and throw on that
sailor suit, because he's not damaged goods.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.439
Wait a minute.
I don't want him doing that.

10:44.543 --> 10:46.875
You gotta go with me down there
and help me get him, all right?

10:46.979 --> 10:50.244
- That place is your scene.
- Face it, Michael. They've won.

10:50.349 --> 10:52.249
He's the new Buster.

10:52.351 --> 10:55.479
<i>This was the worst thing</i>
<i>Michael could possibly hear.</i>

10:55.588 --> 11:00.048
Oh, I'm so sorry. False alarm.
What they tracked down was a shark...

11:00.159 --> 11:03.128
<i>and he must've bitten off the part of</i>
<i>the seal with the tracking device on it.</i>

11:03.229 --> 11:07.029
- Left flipper.
- So, the seal lost his hand too.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.624
Yeah, poor guy's probably out there
without a flipper...

11:09.735 --> 11:13.330
<i>swimming around in a circle,</i>
<i>freaking out his whole family.</i>

11:13.439 --> 11:16.067
That tracking device tells me
he was raised in captivity.

11:16.175 --> 11:20.407
- <i>There's no way he stood a chance</i>
<i>out in the real world.</i>
- See that? He was a victim too.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.040
<i>You both were too sheltered</i>
<i>to learn how to protect yourselves...</i>

11:24.150 --> 11:26.050
and we can't let that happen
to George Michael.

11:26.152 --> 11:29.883
I will help you, Michael.
We've got to rescue your son.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.150
<i>And I've got to</i>
<i>staple this to a seal.</i>

11:32.258 --> 11:34.317
<i>And I've skipped breakfast,</i>
<i>so I'm off to Burger King.</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:42.630
<i>And Lucille arrived at</i>
<i>the hotel where Motherboy was taking place.</i>

11:42.735 --> 11:45.363
This is nice, spending some time,
just the two of us.

11:45.471 --> 11:49.202
Oh- me.
The exact same color.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.208
What are the odds?

11:51.310 --> 11:53.278
Not to worry.
Gangy brought some backups.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.279
We'll get a room
so we can change.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.282
You think enough time has passed
to do Sonny and Cher?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.409
- <i>Who?</i>
- We're here for Motherboy.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.919
And you do realize
this is not the band.

12:03.022 --> 12:05.616
<i>Motherboy was also a heavy metal band...</i>

12:05.725 --> 12:08.717
<i>That used to rock</i>
<i>pretty hard in the '70s.</i>

12:08.828 --> 12:11.194
<i>We are legally obligated</i>
<i>to make the distinction.</i>

12:11.297 --> 12:13.288
Maybe I should let
my dad know that we're here.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.197
Oh, he'll know when we
bring home the trophy.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.770
Yeah, but maybe
I'll just give him a call.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.237
<i>And what name shall we</i>
<i>put the room under?</i>

12:22.341 --> 12:25.310
- Karmopolis.
- <i>And Lindsay was about to see...</i>

12:25.411 --> 12:28.869
<i>a Tobias with</i>
<i>the raw power of George Sr.</i>

12:28.981 --> 12:30.881
I sort of want to talk
to you about some things.

12:30.983 --> 12:34.316
It's a little late for talk, Lindsay.
I'm a man of action now.

12:38.858 --> 12:41.884
You don't need the calories.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.428
This isn't working.

12:46.532 --> 12:50.730
Is it my imagination, or is he more
commanding and mannish?

12:50.836 --> 12:53.999
It's like- I don't know.
Maybe I do want to be with him.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.574
Then you should go to him.
For as it is written...

12:56.675 --> 13:01.942
you shall be with whom you have formed
a more perfect union with under God.

13:02.047 --> 13:04.242
She's right.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.443
This isn't working.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.611
I'm sorry.
You've got the wrong Motherboy.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.621
This looks like the place.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.816
<i>And Michael and Buster</i>
<i>arrived at Motherboy.</i>

13:12.925 --> 13:15.951
Excuse me.
Has a Lucille Bluth checked in?

13:16.061 --> 13:18.359
- I have no one by that name.
- God.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.694
- She knows you're after her.
- She does?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.428
Wait a minute.
I recognize those outfits.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.936
- We're getting you out of here.
- Thank you! Thank you!

13:26.038 --> 13:29.007
- Oh, God! It's red.
<i>- Take me with you! No, please! Please!</i>

13:29.108 --> 13:31.076
- It's the wrong child.
- Where do we go next?

13:31.177 --> 13:35.409
I will tell you this, Michael. If Mother saw
those two, she is going to change clothes.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.414
And that means
he'll be on the balcony.

13:37.516 --> 13:41.213
Whenever she changed clothes,
she made me wait on the balcony until zip-up.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.550
And yet, anything goes at bath time.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.284
Let's check the balconies.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.952
<i>And Barry prepared Gob</i>
<i>to meet with his wife.</i>

13:49.061 --> 13:51.188
If you really want
to settle this, your job...

13:51.297 --> 13:53.231
is to convince
that "wife" of yours...

13:53.332 --> 13:56.961
<i>that you are willing to go in front of thejudge</i>
<i>and admit that you never had sex.</i>

13:57.069 --> 14:00.937
She has a name, Barry. You don't happen
to know what it is by the way, do you?

14:01.040 --> 14:04.168
<i>That's why I want to settle.</i>
<i>I'm not super prepared.</i>

14:04.276 --> 14:07.905
Well, we did have sex.
And I'm not a great liar.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.038
<i>Both things hejust said were lies.</i>

14:10.149 --> 14:13.050
- But if you think it'll scare her off.
- I do, and it will.

14:13.152 --> 14:16.588
And you don't want to go in front of
that judge. I caught him in a drag club.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.853
- What were you doin' there?
- Wow. You should be the lawyer.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.265
<i>And soon, Michael and Buster</i>
<i>surveyed the hotel...</i>

14:28.367 --> 14:30.267
<i>Iooking for George Michael.</i>

14:30.369 --> 14:33.133
There's a very bored-looking little
Sonny Bono on that balcony.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.867
<i>Oh, God. That means</i>
<i>she'll be dressed like Cher.</i>

14:35.975 --> 14:39.672
I have an idea.

14:39.778 --> 14:44.215
It is time I used something I trained for in army,
but I never got a chance to do.

14:44.316 --> 14:48.013
- You cannot zip-line over there!
<i>- Either I zip down or he zips up!</i>

14:48.120 --> 14:50.418
And that is a mighty long zipper
on Mother's Cher jumpsuit.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.956
You have to get on
your knees to start it.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.549
This is much less scary.
Godspeed, Buster.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.764
One, two, three-

15:03.869 --> 15:06.463
You came for me!

15:06.572 --> 15:08.597
<i>Zip me up.</i>

15:15.581 --> 15:19.108
We're switching rooms again.
And costumes.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.956
<i>Tobias had begun work</i>
<i>on the set of</i> Scandal Makers.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.619
<i>What's so great about Tobias is he's got this</i>
<i>obligation to his wife and daughter.</i>

15:29.728 --> 15:32.288
- Whoa. This guy's straight?
- Yeah.

15:32.398 --> 15:35.424
Then what the hell am I wearin' these for?
Look at that.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.094
Hey, gang. I'm sorry.
I don't want to note you to death...

15:38.203 --> 15:40.967
but you should be wearing those
under your pants.

15:41.073 --> 15:44.804
- Why?
- It's a thing. There's dozens of us.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.105
This whole thing is startin' to feel
like a real career killer.

15:47.212 --> 15:49.112
- Yeah, I know, man.
- Also, l-

15:49.214 --> 15:52.149
Tobias, why don't you go learn
your lines, man? Work on them.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.583
Did I get lines? God!

15:54.687 --> 15:56.621
They told me I was just jumping
onto a moving stair car.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.748
If that man's straight,
then I am sober.

15:59.858 --> 16:02.486
Hi. Um, I'm waiting
for "Gawb" Bluth.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.789
I'm Gob Bluth.
My wife send you?

16:04.897 --> 16:07.365
- I'm your wife.
- I knew that.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.594
Nice to see you again, Usarmy.

16:10.703 --> 16:14.434
You lost a lot of weight in Iraq,
especially up in the northern region.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.668
- So where's the seal?
- Hey, that's not my problem.

16:17.776 --> 16:20.267
As far as I'm concerned,
we were never even married.

16:20.379 --> 16:23.314
Maybe I'll just say that
we never <i>sealed</i> the deal.

16:23.415 --> 16:26.441
- You're willing to admit that?
- Lie about it? Yes.

16:26.552 --> 16:29.453
<i>Wow. I mis-underestimated you.</i>

16:29.555 --> 16:33.457
You've got some courage.
Makes me wonder what I'm missing.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.527
You mean, other than your cans?

16:35.627 --> 16:38.187
No. They're still here.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.891
<i>And so Gob set about consummating...</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:43.969
<i>the marriage he'd finally agreed</i>
<i>to claim he hadn't.</i>

16:46.572 --> 16:51.532
<i>And back at Motherboy XXX, Lucille</i>
<i>was finding her new partner an asset.</i>

16:51.643 --> 16:54.737
- Is this your son?
- No, I'm his grandmother.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.838
- He's an orphan.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:56.949 --> 17:00.350
- Well, you guys should win.
- I'm not an orphan. I have a dad.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.750
Well, good luck to you.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.821
Well, that little bit
of honesty helped nothing.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.827
You'd better bring it
to the waltz, young man.

17:10.929 --> 17:14.762
<i>Meanwhile, Michael and Buster</i>
<i>had retrieved Buster's hook...</i>

17:14.867 --> 17:17.233
<i>and were staking out</i>
<i>the situation.</i>

17:17.336 --> 17:20.328
<i>Gypsies.</i>

17:20.439 --> 17:23.499
Hey.

17:23.608 --> 17:26.839
They've changed into gypsies.
My army training...

17:26.944 --> 17:31.382
tells me that this is
going to be a hot mission.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.951
- One hot mission.
- Yes.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.511
I create a diversion, and you grab
George Michael and go.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.490
We need a name.

17:40.592 --> 17:44.551
Maybe "Operation Hot Mother."

17:44.663 --> 17:48.895
- No, let's try to top that.
- <i>They never did.</i>

17:49.001 --> 17:52.095
<i>And later, Operation Hot Mother was underway.</i>

17:52.204 --> 17:55.867
<i>Buster was waiting for Michael's cue</i>
<i>to unplug the lights.</i>

17:55.974 --> 17:59.432
<i>But that's when Buster</i>
<i>caught his hook on a sandbag.</i>

17:59.545 --> 18:02.378
Hey!

18:04.149 --> 18:08.483
<i>And now from the land of gypsies,</i>
<i>Lucille Bluth and her orphaned grandson.</i>

18:08.620 --> 18:10.485
What the hell's goin' on, Buster?
Cut the lights!

18:14.993 --> 18:18.292
- Buster?
- Grab him! Take the gypsy boy!

18:18.397 --> 18:21.127
- I'm taking you out of here. Let's go.
- They haven't served dinner yet.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.962
- George Michael.
- You're not taking him.

18:23.068 --> 18:25.935
- Take me with you!
- What are you doin'? I can't.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.302
<i>Get off of me!</i>
<i>Buster, let's get out of here.</i>

18:28.407 --> 18:31.899
I'm stuck. Go.
Take the boy. Go!

18:32.010 --> 18:34.638
<i>All right, Motherboys.</i>
<i>Our curtain seems to be stuck.</i>

18:34.746 --> 18:38.648
We're going to do some freestyle
waltzing while we get it fixed.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.344
Boys' choice.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.286
- <i>George Michael, you're choosing me.</i>
- No, Mom.

18:44.389 --> 18:47.358
You had no right to bring him to this freak show.
He was supposed to be visiting Buster.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.359
No, you were supposed
to be visiting Buster...

18:49.461 --> 18:51.986
but you made your son do it
because you didn't want to.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.088
- You were supposed to do it?
- You didn't want to?

18:54.199 --> 18:58.932
No. Buster, l- I didn't know how
to, uh, treat you, all right?

18:59.037 --> 19:01.972
I thought that you would be a little
different, but you're not.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.474
I was wrong, okay?
I'm sorry.

19:04.576 --> 19:08.603
You know, you're as good a brother
as you ever were.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.808
- Thank you.
- All right?

19:11.917 --> 19:15.182
Yes. I am no different.
I am the same old Motherboy.

19:15.287 --> 19:18.518
George Michael still has a chance.
Take him!

19:20.692 --> 19:23.217
Thanks. Let's go.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.956
Boys' choice?

19:26.064 --> 19:31.001
That is, if you're not embarrassed
to take my hook.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.162
Of course not.

19:36.308 --> 19:39.539
I'm Peter Pan,
and you're Captain Hook.

19:39.645 --> 19:43.979
We'll pretend it's a costume.
Let's dance.

19:48.654 --> 19:51.589
<i>And that night, Michael,</i>
<i>his brother and his son...</i>

19:51.690 --> 19:54.090
- <i>arrived at the Promise Land.</i>
- All right.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.320
I appreciate you taking me
up here to see Ann.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.760
- A promise is a promise.
And I'm glad the three of us...
- Yeah.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.492
- Were able to spend some time together.
- Oh, yeah.

20:01.600 --> 20:07.061
- And I finally feel good about myself. "Saddest."
- <i>And I saw some of those people.</i>

20:07.172 --> 20:10.039
- That was a very competitive category.
- Oh, don't I know it.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.042
- Here we go.
- I can't get out, actually.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.908
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

20:15.013 --> 20:19.177
<i>Lindsay finds herself strangely compelled</i>
<i>to be with Tobias.</i>

20:19.284 --> 20:22.014
I have never
been more attracted to you.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.054
Wow. The service
sent you over fast.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.784
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm in the wrong trailer.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.792
<i>But not the one she's married to.</i>

20:28.894 --> 20:31.886
So you don't cry
when you take those off?

20:31.997 --> 20:35.160
<i>Having finally had sex, Gob can admit...</i>

20:35.267 --> 20:37.462
<i>he never consummated</i>
<i>their marriage.</i>

20:37.569 --> 20:42.700
Judge, maybe you should take a look at this.
It was taken in your office just moments ago.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.902
- <i>But Gob catches a lucky break.</i>
- There's no way to tell who this man is.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.036
<i>But it doesn't last long.</i>

20:48.146 --> 20:50.546
That's me, Your Honor.
L- my wife.

20:50.649 --> 20:53.982
<i>We really lost this case.</i>

20:54.086 --> 20:56.953

<i>with her one</i>
<i>scary campfire story.</i>

The only thing more terrifying...

21:03.328 --> 21:06.593

Hey, campers.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.731
I'm a monster!

21:16.842 --> 21:18.810
This may have been
a step backwards.
