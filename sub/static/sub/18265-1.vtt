I don't need to tell
you, Mr. Speaker,

00:22.338 --> 00:25.508
that zombies don't
recognize borders and that

00:25.542 --> 00:29.279
a zombie invasion in the United
States could easily turn into

00:29.312 --> 00:32.448
a continent-wide
pandemic so on behalf of

00:32.482 --> 00:35.385
concerned Canadians everywhere,
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask

00:35.418 --> 00:38.421
the Minister of Foreign Affairs
is he working with

00:38.455 --> 00:40.757
his American
counterparts to develop

00:40.790 --> 00:44.527
an international zombie strategy
so that a zombie invasion

00:44.561 --> 00:47.964
does not turn into a
zombie apocalypse?

00:47.997 --> 00:52.202
(cheers and applause)

00:54.037 --> 00:59.876
Coming up next on Action
News 7, a dog was found...

00:59.909 --> 01:02.579
excuse me just one moment...

01:02.612 --> 01:04.313
I see. Ladies and gentlemen,

01:05.382 --> 01:08.151
I'm receiving a special broadcast

01:08.184 --> 01:11.697
about something
that's happening.

01:11.738 --> 01:16.359
Van Dorn Street is blocked
right now by overturned cars.

01:16.392 --> 01:20.764
We are receiving news that the
bodies of the recently deceased

01:20.797 --> 01:23.099
are returning to life and
attacking the living.

01:23.133 --> 01:26.936
Officers are on their way right
now to take you to safety.

01:26.970 --> 01:29.472
...A live reporter out
there on the scene.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.575
(screaming)

01:32.609 --> 01:36.112
There are millions,
millions of zombies

01:36.146 --> 01:40.517
roaming the earth
chewing people up.

01:40.550 --> 01:42.619
Is that crazy or what?

01:42.652 --> 01:44.154
I suggest you find
the tallest building

01:44.187 --> 01:45.989
in your town and jump off.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.358
The zombie outbreak is
no longer an outbreak,

01:48.391 --> 01:51.094
but a full-on pandemic.

01:51.127 --> 01:57.066
Warning you to stay
indoors, to lock your doors,

01:57.100 --> 02:01.538
to arm yourself with any
weapons that are available

02:01.571 --> 02:04.140
and this is America
so you should have plenty.

02:04.174 --> 02:07.277
Grab something heavy,
something that you could hit

02:07.310 --> 02:11.881
very hard with, and let's party!

03:41.104 --> 03:42.906
I'm Jonathan Leonard from
Geekscape and we're going to

03:42.939 --> 03:45.441
find out what the average
person knows about zombies.

03:45.475 --> 03:50.313
A zombie is someone who's dead
and came out of the ground

03:50.346 --> 03:54.918
and is bleeding and is gross
looking and they'll kill you.

03:54.951 --> 03:56.219
What do zombies want?

03:56.252 --> 03:57.654
Brains.

03:57.687 --> 03:58.788
What are the
zombie rules?

03:58.821 --> 04:03.092
Zombie rules is that you
die, but you don't die.

04:03.126 --> 04:05.762
If you want to be more like
angsty and metaphorical,

04:05.795 --> 04:09.799
a zombie could be someone
trapped in a workday

04:09.832 --> 04:12.402
who lives in a box
and doesn't have fun.

04:12.435 --> 04:14.637
In Chinese tradition
a zombie just jumps.

04:14.671 --> 04:19.341
It doesn't talk, it doesn't
walk, it just jumps.

04:19.375 --> 04:20.910
What?

04:20.944 --> 04:23.479
Arms out and then it
just hops like that.

04:29.652 --> 04:33.156
The zombie is a relentlessly
aggressive, reanimated

04:33.189 --> 04:36.059
human corpse driven by
a biological infection,

04:36.092 --> 04:37.860
so there's kind of
three aspects to that.

04:37.894 --> 04:39.896
You don't negotiate
with a zombie, right?

04:39.929 --> 04:42.465
You can't talk a zombie
out of wanting to eat you.

04:42.498 --> 04:43.566
You can't say, "Hey,
go around the corner,

04:43.599 --> 04:45.301
there's a family of five
getting in a Winnebago.

04:45.335 --> 04:48.037
You can eat all five of
them and leave me alone."

04:48.071 --> 04:50.206
Secondly, it's a reanimated
human corpse, limited in

04:50.239 --> 04:52.842
its ability so it's actually
a rotting corpse.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.044
Thirdly, a biological
infection which is,

04:55.078 --> 04:57.880
I think, what makes zombies
really, really scary.

04:57.914 --> 05:00.483
MAN: They're us and
they're us having succumbed to

05:00.516 --> 05:03.086
our worst fear
which is our own death.

05:03.119 --> 05:06.089
You can't outstrip them even
though they're slower than you.

05:06.122 --> 05:08.658
Eventually you have
to go to sleep.

05:08.691 --> 05:11.060
They don't, so even if
you're a mile ahead of them,

05:11.094 --> 05:13.463
when you're snoring
they'll catch up and meet you.

05:13.496 --> 05:15.365
And that's like death itself.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.867
You do everything
you can to stave it off.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.870
You do the steps at Santa
Monica, you don't eat red meat.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.839
They'll get you in the end.

05:25.808 --> 05:29.512
Most famous monsters,
the big-screen monsters

05:29.545 --> 05:31.547
have some kind of
long-standing tradition

05:31.581 --> 05:35.251
where their stories have been
developed previously --

05:35.284 --> 05:38.087
the vampire, the werewolf,
even the slasher,

05:38.121 --> 05:42.291
the serial killer comes out
of a crime novel tradition.

05:42.325 --> 05:45.828
The zombie comes kind of
directly out of folklore

05:45.862 --> 05:48.998
and there really wasn't a
literary narrative tradition.

05:49.032 --> 05:52.035
When you take a look at zombies
in cinema specifically,

05:52.068 --> 05:54.937
you can technically go
back into the silent era.

05:54.971 --> 05:57.874
There are, of course, classics
like "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"

05:57.907 --> 06:00.109
where you have the sleepwalking
character in there who is

06:00.143 --> 06:04.347
very much zombie-like, and yet
for all intents and purposes,

06:04.380 --> 06:07.183
we all have kind of
collectively agreed,

06:07.216 --> 06:11.220
it all starts in 1932
with "White Zombie."

06:12.588 --> 06:13.856
Zombies!

06:15.691 --> 06:17.527
The filmmakers in the '30s
and '40s were kind of

06:17.560 --> 06:20.463
making up these
stories out of nothing.

06:20.496 --> 06:23.299
They weren't taking existing
material and adapting it.

06:23.332 --> 06:25.935
If anything, they were
drawing on misconceptions

06:25.968 --> 06:30.440
and misunderstandings of race
relations in the colonies,

06:30.473 --> 06:33.409
sensational ideas of
what voodoo and folklore

06:33.443 --> 06:34.811
really meant in Haiti.

06:34.844 --> 06:37.447
They took that idea and
they kind of merged it with

06:37.480 --> 06:40.116
the visual style
of Todd Browning

06:40.149 --> 06:42.185
and the gothic tradition.

06:42.218 --> 06:47.156
I thought that beauty
alone would satisfy,

06:47.190 --> 06:50.626
but the soul is gone.

06:50.660 --> 06:55.498
I can't bear those
empty, staring eyes.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.801
So in "White Zombie," you get
a narrative that takes place

06:58.835 --> 07:02.772
in Haiti and it involves
Haitian voodoo, but then there's

07:02.805 --> 07:06.843
a gothic castle on the coast
of Haiti for some reason.

07:06.876 --> 07:10.113
So it's this weird fusion
of a misunderstood,

07:10.146 --> 07:14.550
sensationalized folklore with
an established and successful

07:14.584 --> 07:17.854
cinematic tradition
for monsters.

07:17.887 --> 07:20.423
The early films are always about

07:20.456 --> 07:23.059
black people
menacing white women.

07:23.092 --> 07:26.963
It's really the enslavement
by the former slaves

07:26.996 --> 07:31.267
that makes that monster
initially so terrifying.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.903
The next major step in sort of
the evolution of the zombies

07:33.936 --> 07:37.607
of pop culture icon comes
when science fiction briefly

07:37.640 --> 07:41.277
takes the lead over
horror in the 1950s

07:41.310 --> 07:44.580
and then you get movies
like "Invisible Invaders..."

07:44.614 --> 07:46.849
People of Earth,
this is your last warning.

07:46.883 --> 07:50.620
...in which aliens resurrect
human corpses and use them

07:50.653 --> 07:54.991
like puppets to try to take over
which is virtually the same plot

07:55.024 --> 07:57.493
as "Plan 9 from Outer Space,"
one of the most infamous movies

07:57.527 --> 08:00.196
of all time, and what's
interesting about those movies

08:00.229 --> 08:03.432
is there we have it, we have
dead people coming back.

08:03.466 --> 08:05.101
They're not
demonically possessed.

08:05.134 --> 08:07.937
They're not impelled by
some desire to eat flesh

08:07.970 --> 08:09.605
or something we don't know.

08:09.639 --> 08:13.976
They're being puppeteered by
aliens, but they're zombies

08:14.010 --> 08:15.878
and they're more like
the zombies we know today

08:15.912 --> 08:18.648
than the ones that
preceded them.

08:18.681 --> 08:20.449
But then what happened
was George Romero...

08:20.483 --> 08:26.289
TV: The dead who live
on living flesh.

08:26.322 --> 08:31.027
The dead whose haunted
souls hunt the living.

08:31.060 --> 08:34.764
The living whose bodies
are the only food for these

08:34.797 --> 08:37.832
ungodly creatures.

08:37.866 --> 08:42.672
(screaming)

08:42.705 --> 08:46.042
"Night of the Living Dead."

08:48.611 --> 08:51.681
We were trying to
create a new creature,

08:51.714 --> 08:55.484
somebody that was
dead but came back.

08:55.518 --> 08:57.353
We didn't have a name
for that creature.

08:57.386 --> 08:59.155
We called them ghouls.

09:00.656 --> 09:04.227
I said, "George, who are these
characters chasing this girl?"

09:04.260 --> 09:06.162
He said, "I don't know."

09:06.195 --> 09:08.097
And I said, "Well,
when I was reading it,

09:08.130 --> 09:10.032
it seemed to me they
could be dead people."

09:10.066 --> 09:11.267
He said, "That's good."

09:11.300 --> 09:13.436
I said, "But what do they do?
You don't say that either."

09:13.469 --> 09:15.838
He said, "I don't know."

09:15.871 --> 09:19.442
I said, "Why don't we use
my flesh-eating idea?"

09:19.475 --> 09:22.178
GEORGE: There was an article
in "Cahiers du Cinema"

09:22.211 --> 09:25.014
that called them zombies
for the first time.

09:25.047 --> 09:28.918
I was clinging to the idea that
we had created something new

09:28.951 --> 09:32.855
and when I read that article,
I said, this ain't new at all,

09:32.888 --> 09:37.159
so that's when I started to
accept them as zombies.

09:39.729 --> 09:41.197
(screaming)

09:41.230 --> 09:44.700
"Night of the Living Dead"
did not create zombies

09:44.734 --> 09:48.471
but it rewrote zombie lore.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.273
I like to say that there
were zombie movies

09:50.306 --> 09:52.174
before George Romero,
the same way there were

09:52.208 --> 09:54.143
space movies before
George Lucas.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.177
It changed everything.

09:55.211 --> 09:59.882
It scrapped the old
voodoo zombie and gave us

09:59.915 --> 10:03.552
the plague-driven flesh eater.

10:03.586 --> 10:07.189
The idea of the end of the world
and zombies are around

10:07.223 --> 10:09.659
and the world's been
overtaken by them

10:09.692 --> 10:12.695
and it's people against zombies
and our population is dwindling

10:12.728 --> 10:14.864
was introduced in that movie
and no one had ever really

10:14.897 --> 10:17.500
taken zombies in that
direction before.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.503
It's almost as if the zombie
as we know it was some sort of

10:20.536 --> 10:22.571
like biblical figure
that's been around forever

10:22.605 --> 10:23.973
and we can all
pick up and use it.

10:24.006 --> 10:26.642
It's not, it was George's idea,
the whole biting thing,

10:26.676 --> 10:31.113
the passing on the disease,
the waking up -- all George.

10:31.147 --> 10:36.319
What's monumental to me about
that film was the fact that

10:36.352 --> 10:41.824
in 1968, this film was
released with a black man

10:41.857 --> 10:46.028
and a white woman, and
throughout the entire movie,

10:46.062 --> 10:50.299
nobody made a big deal
out of the fact that

10:50.333 --> 10:53.069
we had two different colors.

10:53.102 --> 10:55.738
It was pure survival.

11:03.479 --> 11:05.981
GEORGE: We thought we were
pushing the envelope a little.

11:06.015 --> 11:08.250
We thought that some of
the scenes with the guts

11:08.284 --> 11:12.154
and when the kids get
roasted in the truck...

11:12.188 --> 11:15.858
we had actually one shot of
a naked zombie from behind.

11:15.891 --> 11:18.761
Bold -- that's about
as bold as we went.

11:18.794 --> 11:24.133
There were extreme audience
and media reactions.

11:24.166 --> 11:28.637
Reviewers who thought that
we were satanically inspired,

11:28.671 --> 11:32.641
that we were scourges, that
our film should be banned.

11:32.675 --> 11:35.745
Horror movies were not
raw like that back then.

11:35.778 --> 11:39.048
George's was almost like a
real thing, a documentary.

11:39.081 --> 11:40.850
The reaction to that movie
is what really got me going

11:40.883 --> 11:43.853
because it said people
were fainting in theatres

11:43.886 --> 11:47.990
and I thought, I don't think
I want to see this movie.

11:48.023 --> 11:50.159
It made me not want to see it
and then when I saw it,

11:50.192 --> 11:52.228
I was like, yeah, that's why
I didn't want to see it.

11:52.261 --> 11:55.231
I remember the first time I saw
it was at a midnight screening

11:55.264 --> 11:57.566
and the audience was
absolutely terrified.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.836
The sequence that blew people
away was the little girl

12:00.870 --> 12:03.706
down in the basement
who we discover

12:03.739 --> 12:07.543
is chewing on her
parents' intestines.

12:07.576 --> 12:08.744
The entire audience flipped out.

12:08.778 --> 12:11.847
People got up and left the
theatre during that scene.

12:11.881 --> 12:16.886
Midway through the movie
I hear this "boom, boom, boom,"

12:16.919 --> 12:18.654
and I'm wondering
what's going on?

12:18.687 --> 12:20.122
Was this part of the movie?

12:20.156 --> 12:24.894
And all of a sudden, I see
this guy go down the aisle...

12:24.927 --> 12:28.664
He blasts through
the doors, out to the curb

12:28.697 --> 12:34.336
and goes, blech...
all over Cambridge Avenue.

12:34.370 --> 12:37.339
I said, okay,
I've got to meet this guy.

12:37.373 --> 12:40.342
Whoever made this movie,
I've got to meet this guy.

The greatest zombie film in my
opinion is "Dawn of the Dead."

13:40.970 --> 13:44.006
Every time it's scary,
it becomes funny,

13:44.039 --> 13:45.441
and every time it's funny
it becomes scary.

13:45.474 --> 13:46.809
Zombies on an ice skating rink,

13:46.842 --> 13:48.711
it doesn't get any
funnier than that.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.647
It almost as if history
conspires to hand Romero

13:51.680 --> 13:54.483
the absolute perfect
metaphor for the zombie.

13:54.517 --> 13:56.418
You couldn't do any
better than that.

13:56.452 --> 13:59.421
We're a nation that has become
the shambling consumers

13:59.455 --> 14:01.824
that walk up and down the
hallways desperately wanting

14:01.857 --> 14:05.394
to consume and we have
lost all individuality.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.530
It's absolutely perfect.

14:07.563 --> 14:10.466
For me, "Dawn of the Dead" was
kind of the seminal zombie movie

14:10.499 --> 14:12.134
because it really
was the middle finger

14:12.167 --> 14:14.169
to the death of
the baby boomers.

14:14.203 --> 14:18.073
It was this generation that
started off so idealistic

14:18.107 --> 14:22.011
and was so, "Hey man, don't
trust anyone over 30, man.

14:22.044 --> 14:23.946
Don't trust anyone over 30!"

14:23.979 --> 14:25.648
And then they turn 30!

14:25.681 --> 14:27.950
(laughter)

14:27.983 --> 14:30.286
I mean, that moment where
they say, "What is that?"

14:30.319 --> 14:32.388
And he goes, "Looks like
a shopping center,

14:32.421 --> 14:33.822
one of those new
indoor malls."

14:33.856 --> 14:36.091
See, there were no
shopping centers.

14:36.125 --> 14:40.062
That was the first shopping
center that we had ever seen.

14:40.095 --> 14:42.798
With the dawn of the
death of the ideals.

14:42.831 --> 14:46.769
Every time it's Black Friday,
how can you not think of

14:46.802 --> 14:48.571
"Dawn of the Dead?"

14:48.604 --> 14:55.611
It's chilling and disgusting
all at once, you know?

14:55.644 --> 14:58.113
MAN: So there is this
evolutionary process that George

14:58.147 --> 15:01.317
is going through and in "Day..."
what he does is he says,

15:01.350 --> 15:04.887
okay, now we're going to
see the zombies evolve,

15:04.920 --> 15:08.357
and that was groundbreaking.

15:08.390 --> 15:12.061
That's what George's genius is,
I think, that he completely

15:12.094 --> 15:15.297
swaps allegiances
with his films.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.833
Often, you'll root for
the zombies which is, you know,

15:17.866 --> 15:20.169
you never root for the zombies
in contemporary zombie films

15:20.202 --> 15:22.571
because they're at our
protagonist's throats literally

15:22.605 --> 15:24.506
and we don't want those
protagonists to die,

15:24.540 --> 15:27.409
whereas, with, particularly
with "Day..." most of the human

15:27.443 --> 15:31.013
characters are hideous,
monstrous, aggressive military

15:31.046 --> 15:33.315
types who you just want
to see torn to pieces

15:33.349 --> 15:37.953
and when Bob shoots
Captain Rhodes, you cheer.

15:49.398 --> 15:52.701
It's all down to Howard Sherman
being just so sweet, you know,

15:52.735 --> 15:55.270
when he's using the razor
and he's on the phone

15:55.304 --> 15:57.206
and he's listening to the music
and he's hearing music

15:57.239 --> 15:59.608
for the first time
and it's like a baby.

15:59.642 --> 16:02.711
I just think it's one of the
most beautiful performances

16:02.745 --> 16:06.482
since Karloff's "Frankenstein"
as a kind of adult newborn.

16:06.515 --> 16:07.916
There's something
so deeply tragic

16:07.950 --> 16:10.285
and sympathetic about him.

16:10.319 --> 16:11.520
Oh, I don't feel that at all.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.722
There's nothing tragic
in a reanimated corpse.

16:13.756 --> 16:14.790
How can there be?

16:14.823 --> 16:17.359
A reanimated corpse is
just a reanimated corpse.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.460
There's nothing tragic about it.

16:18.494 --> 16:19.828
You shoot it in the head.

16:19.862 --> 16:21.463
Bob's your uncle.

16:21.497 --> 16:25.768
HOWARD: Boris Karloff, with that
role, had the opportunity to do

16:25.801 --> 16:32.341
a lot of very subtle intimate
things, most monsters don't.

16:32.374 --> 16:34.843
In, as Bob, I did too.

16:34.877 --> 16:38.280
I had a lot of very
interesting, subtle,

16:38.313 --> 16:42.851
and by genre standards,
very unusual things to do

16:42.885 --> 16:48.891
and the fact that I had the
opportunity to do something

16:48.924 --> 16:52.294
like that is what brought
an element of humanity to it

16:52.327 --> 16:55.564
that normally you just
don't find in the genre.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.634
GEORGE: I don't think
zombies are intelligent.

16:58.667 --> 17:01.336
I think that they just
remember what they used to do,

17:01.370 --> 17:02.705
what they used to be.

17:02.738 --> 17:07.376
My zombie characters that have
some personality, I think,

17:07.409 --> 17:13.348
are just -- what they do
because of their memory

17:13.382 --> 17:18.787
makes them a bit heroic,
but it's just memory.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.021
It's just memory.

17:20.055 --> 17:21.757
I mean, it's just like when
you first see Big Daddy

17:21.790 --> 17:25.359
in "Land of the Dead,"
he's doing what he always did.

17:25.394 --> 17:27.829
He's trying to fill gas.

17:27.863 --> 17:31.467
He hears the bell, "ding-ding"
and he thinks a car came in,

17:31.500 --> 17:34.269
so he comes out looking
to fill somebody's car.

17:34.303 --> 17:39.141
I mean, that's how stupid
he is, but he's heroic.

17:39.174 --> 17:40.676
(laughing)

17:50.319 --> 17:53.255
(yawning)

17:53.288 --> 17:55.657
What a perfectly
average morning,

17:55.691 --> 17:59.061
nothing unusual about today
which makes it the perfect day

17:59.094 --> 18:02.931
for a zombie apocalypse
to not happen.

18:03.699 --> 18:06.068
(humming)

18:06.101 --> 18:07.870
It's beautiful morning.

18:07.903 --> 18:11.073
Mmm, I smell breakfast cooking.

18:11.106 --> 18:14.343
Oh, what's this on the news?

18:14.376 --> 18:16.645
But it has been
reported that the dead

18:16.678 --> 18:19.014
are coming
back to life.

18:19.047 --> 18:19.948
Oh my God!

18:19.982 --> 18:21.817
The president is
declaring marshal law

18:21.850 --> 18:24.386
for the state
of New York.

18:24.419 --> 18:26.421
Betty? Is that you?

18:26.455 --> 18:29.091
Is that blood all
over your jammy-jams?

18:29.124 --> 18:30.659
Why are you just standing there?

18:30.692 --> 18:34.630
Why is there a smoke machine
running in the hallway now?

18:34.663 --> 18:35.731
Oh well.

18:35.764 --> 18:37.466
Even though I've seen this
scene a million times

18:37.499 --> 18:40.369
in every movie, I'm just
going to slowly start

18:40.402 --> 18:43.939
walking towards you with
my arms outstretched,

18:43.972 --> 18:46.141
asking if everything's
okay, even though

18:46.175 --> 18:49.578
this looks highly suspicious and
at any moment you're going to...

18:49.611 --> 18:51.380
Oh my God!

18:51.413 --> 18:54.249
Zombies are the only horror
films that I know where

18:54.283 --> 18:56.952
you're totally minding your own
business and you're not looking

18:56.985 --> 19:01.523
for trouble and you're not the
hot girl or the token black guy.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.326
You've broken no rules
to let you get killed

19:04.359 --> 19:06.495
but they come for you anyway.

19:06.528 --> 19:08.530
It's not about you,
that's the main thing.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.433
If something is going to
eviscerate you, eat your guts,

19:11.466 --> 19:13.302
you'd like it to be
about your guts, right?

19:13.335 --> 19:16.605
You'd like your guts to be
special, but if I can just

19:16.638 --> 19:19.541
step to the left and
he eats that guy's guts,

19:19.575 --> 19:21.243
it's not about
me anymore.

19:21.276 --> 19:22.344
Vampires are
all about me.

19:22.377 --> 19:24.646
They make me feel sexy and
libidinal and all that.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.982
Zombies, they could
care less about me

19:27.015 --> 19:28.383
and that's actually
our biggest nightmare.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.418
They don't sparkle.

19:29.451 --> 19:30.452
Right.

19:30.485 --> 19:32.321
(laughter)

19:32.354 --> 19:34.723
Every time you look at a zombie
in pop culture, whether it's

19:34.756 --> 19:38.160
a movie or a television show
or a comic book, anything,

19:38.193 --> 19:40.429
it is ultimately just
a reflection of things

19:40.462 --> 19:42.331
we're afraid of at that moment.

19:42.364 --> 19:44.433
When you start with
"Night of the living Dead,"

19:44.466 --> 19:48.070
1960s, late '60s,
we're afraid of Vietnam,

19:48.103 --> 19:50.205
we're afraid of the death
we're seeing on television.

19:50.239 --> 19:52.875
That's easy, but we're also
afraid about what's happening

19:52.908 --> 19:56.612
to the home, the nuclear
family is breaking down.

19:56.645 --> 19:58.313
So "Night of the Living Dead"
becomes a literal

19:58.347 --> 20:00.182
siege on the home.

20:00.215 --> 20:01.917
Jump ahead ten years --
"Dawn of the Dead,"

20:01.950 --> 20:03.051
what are we afraid of now?

20:03.085 --> 20:04.887
Consumerism, consumption.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.889
Jump ahead --
"Day of the Dead,"

20:06.922 --> 20:08.657
now we're afraid
of the Cold War,

20:08.690 --> 20:12.494
we're afraid of the apocalypse,
of nuclear destruction.

20:12.527 --> 20:15.464
As the culture changed,
zombies, to an extent,

20:15.497 --> 20:16.598
changed along with it.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.166
In the 1980s all of a sudden,
you see them starting to

20:18.200 --> 20:19.568
get a little bit funny.

20:19.601 --> 20:20.702
You had "Return of
the Living Dead,"

20:20.736 --> 20:22.738
all of a sudden, you have
all this comedy going on.

20:22.771 --> 20:25.207
The '80s were sort of a
little bit of a lighter time.

20:33.515 --> 20:35.817
Brains!

20:35.851 --> 20:39.454
But it's also desperately
frightening and depressing.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.924
That is probably one of
the most, if not the most,

20:41.957 --> 20:44.559
apocalyptic zombie
movies ever made.

20:44.593 --> 20:46.762
They're also the most
indestructible and frightening

20:46.795 --> 20:49.264
zombies in zombie movie history.

20:49.298 --> 20:52.768
If you ever find yourself in
a zombie apocalypse, the key,

20:52.801 --> 20:54.603
the first thing you should
look for is, are you in

20:54.636 --> 20:56.738
the "Return of the Living Dead"
Universe or not,

20:56.772 --> 20:59.841
because if you are, give up,
there's no hope.

21:00.776 --> 21:03.011
Brains!

21:03.045 --> 21:04.246
Another thing that's
interesting about

21:04.279 --> 21:07.015
"Return of the Living Dead"
is it gives rise to one of

21:07.049 --> 21:10.886
the longest-lasting aspects of
the zombie in pop culture...

21:10.919 --> 21:13.689
More brains!

21:13.722 --> 21:15.090
...and that's the idea
of the zombies

21:15.123 --> 21:17.192
coming back wanting brains.

21:17.225 --> 21:28.470
♪ Brains, brains, brains... ♪

21:28.503 --> 21:30.405
So the '90's were kind of,
I don't want to say they were

21:30.439 --> 21:33.742
a dead era, but they were
definitely slow comparatively.

21:33.775 --> 21:35.577
Party's over.

21:35.610 --> 21:37.412
"Dead Alive," Peter Jackson's
Sumatran rat-monkey

21:37.446 --> 21:40.849
family issue,
gore-fest insanity.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.552
It was probably the most
important film of the '90s.

21:46.488 --> 21:47.889
And then 9/11 came along

21:47.923 --> 21:50.659
and all of a sudden,
everything felt up-ended.

21:50.692 --> 21:53.028
I think it primed the
culture, the larger culture,

21:53.061 --> 21:55.130
not the people who
already like zombies,

21:55.163 --> 21:59.301
but the larger culture to
accept and entertain the idea

21:59.334 --> 22:02.571
of apocalyptic scenarios
being a possibility.

22:02.604 --> 22:05.307
A few years later when Katrina
happened, anyone who still had

22:05.340 --> 22:07.776
faith, "don't worry, no matter
what happens, we can handle it,"

22:07.809 --> 22:09.344
this was an aberration.

22:09.378 --> 22:11.747
I think that shook it as well.

22:11.780 --> 22:13.749
I don't think the zombie culture
would be where it was today

22:13.782 --> 22:15.717
if it weren't for
those kind of things.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.854
It brought death to
people's doorstep.

22:18.887 --> 22:22.758
You have "28 Days Later" which
has plenty of imagery which is

22:22.791 --> 22:27.329
evocative of an apocalypse
or a natural disaster.

22:27.362 --> 22:30.265
This fear of disease, so we
start seeing more and more

22:30.298 --> 22:34.102
of the infection narratives
and the invasion narratives

22:34.136 --> 22:38.340
as a kind of a reflection of
the fears of the 21st century.

22:38.373 --> 22:42.411
Zombies are very versatile as
metaphors because they are us.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.946
They are the people among you,

22:44.980 --> 22:47.482
and I think maybe that
preoccupation in society,

22:47.516 --> 22:50.585
the lack of safety that
we're suddenly all feeling,

22:50.619 --> 22:55.190
zombies are a good way to
cathartically act out that fear.

22:55.223 --> 22:57.893
What I always find
fascinating about zombies

22:57.926 --> 23:01.930
is the "Invasion of the
Body Snatchers" aspect.

23:06.701 --> 23:11.773
The most horrific idea is
that your brother, your wife,

23:11.807 --> 23:17.746
your sister, a loved one,
externally, on the outside,

23:17.779 --> 23:21.083
that person is exactly the same,
but on the inside

23:21.116 --> 23:23.852
everything is gone,
everything is erased.

23:26.421 --> 23:29.491
KYLE: To me, what the zombie
narrative is really about

23:29.524 --> 23:32.661
is losing friends and family.

23:32.694 --> 23:38.700
Having your loved ones turn
against you, become monstrous,

23:38.733 --> 23:41.470
but the biggest threat that
you face isn't some nameless,

23:41.503 --> 23:45.006
faceless, other monster --
it's your mom,

23:45.040 --> 23:46.808
it's your sister,
it's your wife.

23:46.842 --> 23:50.745
That, to me, encapsulates
the real terror of the zombie,

23:50.779 --> 23:53.415
the fact that we all have
the potential within us

23:53.448 --> 23:54.649
to be monstrous.

23:54.683 --> 24:03.592
♪

24:03.625 --> 24:05.994
There's that trailer,
it's called "Dead Island,"

24:06.027 --> 24:09.064
it was a video game and you
see this kind of freaky girl

24:09.097 --> 24:12.501
attacking an older man and then
it kind of all goes in reverse

24:12.534 --> 24:14.736
ending with it being
like a family vacation

24:14.769 --> 24:16.371
and they're taking
a photo together.

24:16.404 --> 24:19.808
You realize it was his daughter
that he's beating with a bat.

24:19.841 --> 24:20.842
(laughing)

24:20.876 --> 24:21.943
It was pretty awesome.

24:21.977 --> 24:24.713
I dreamt about them last night,
I dreamt about them.

24:24.746 --> 24:28.517
I thought making "Shaun
of the Dead" would stop

24:28.550 --> 24:30.685
my recurring dreams about
zombies, but it hasn't.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.555
I still occasionally have
a dream where I'm in

24:33.588 --> 24:37.058
that classic situation where
they're outside the house

24:37.092 --> 24:41.429
and I can't get away
and it's fucking terrifying.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.066
"Shaun" happened because
Edgar Wright and myself

24:45.100 --> 24:47.502
were making a TV show, "Spaced."

24:47.536 --> 24:49.437
The beginning of one of
the episodes starts with me

24:49.471 --> 24:53.375
lost in the game "Resident Evil"
and it was just a very sort of

24:53.408 --> 24:58.547
sneaky way to enable myself
to shoot some zombies.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.183
They totally captured that
feeling of Romero's films,

25:01.216 --> 25:02.384
that shambolic zombie.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.252
It looked like they'd almost
watched those movies

25:04.286 --> 25:06.555
to get the way those
creatures moved.

25:06.588 --> 25:09.858
It really ignited that
sort of love in me again,

25:09.891 --> 25:11.626
and Edgar as well, and
we started talking about

25:11.660 --> 25:13.361
"Dawn of the Dead" and
how much we loved it

25:13.395 --> 25:15.163
and then we had
"Dawn of the Dead" on set,

25:15.197 --> 25:16.932
and we were like, we should
make a zombie film.

25:23.672 --> 25:26.975
Well, I have to say that
"Shaun of the Dead" was probably

25:27.008 --> 25:30.912
my favorite zombie film
that wasn't made by me.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.715
I think "Shaun of the Dead"
is probably

25:33.748 --> 25:35.317
the second most important
zombie film ever made

25:35.350 --> 25:37.786
because of the
social commentary.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.591
It encapsulates an
entire generation

25:42.624 --> 25:45.227
of young English people
in the very same way

25:45.260 --> 25:48.830
Kevin Smith's "Clerks"
encapsulated my generation.

25:48.863 --> 25:50.699
Forget zombies, I think if
you just were going to look

25:50.732 --> 25:54.102
at a movie that put that
generation through a lens,

25:54.135 --> 25:55.937
that's "Shaun of the Dead."

25:59.741 --> 26:01.543
The "Walking Dead" came about
because of my love

26:01.576 --> 26:06.481
of George Romero films and
zombie movies in general.

26:06.514 --> 26:09.517
Most zombie films end with
either all of the characters

26:09.551 --> 26:12.387
dying or two or three of
the characters living,

26:12.420 --> 26:14.889
while all of the others die
and they kind of ride off

26:14.923 --> 26:17.158
into the sunset and you
never know where they go.

26:17.192 --> 26:20.328
The "Walking Dead"
was devised as

26:20.362 --> 26:23.531
the zombie movie
that never ends.

26:23.565 --> 26:28.470
I will plainly say that Bram
Stoker is to Stephenie Meyer

26:28.503 --> 26:30.705
as George Romero is
to Robert Kirkman.

26:30.739 --> 26:33.074
There is no "Walking Dead"
without "Night of the Living

26:33.108 --> 26:35.877
Dead," "Dawn of the Dead,"
"Day of the Dead."

26:35.910 --> 26:37.312
I definitely owe that guy.

26:40.649 --> 26:43.885
When Ben comes out of that house
at the end of

26:43.918 --> 26:46.888
"Night of the Living Dead," and
you think he's getting rescued

26:46.921 --> 26:49.224
and instead he gets shot...

26:49.257 --> 26:51.126
Okay, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

26:51.159 --> 26:52.861
That's another one
for the farm.

26:52.894 --> 26:54.796
...the sinking feeling
that that gives you,

26:54.829 --> 26:58.433
the sense of loss,
definitely inspires the way

26:58.466 --> 27:01.069
that I want to mess
with expectations.

27:01.102 --> 27:05.340
If characters weren't dying
constantly in a zombie story,

27:05.373 --> 27:08.376
in an apocalyptic story,
it would be completely false

27:08.410 --> 27:11.713
and fake and unrealistic and
it'd be complete bullshit

27:11.746 --> 27:14.249
and there are times when I'm
writing a "Walking Dead" comic

27:14.282 --> 27:17.319
where I'll go, wait a minute,
it's been like ten issues

27:17.352 --> 27:18.620
and no one's died.

27:18.653 --> 27:21.423
This sucks, someone's
got to die this issue.

27:21.456 --> 27:25.994
People gots to die,
otherwise it's just dull.

27:29.164 --> 27:32.434
Because the zombie was kind of
organically created by different

27:32.467 --> 27:36.938
people, I think filmmakers and
authors and video game designers

27:36.971 --> 27:40.809
feel they have a great deal of
liberty with what a zombie is,

27:40.842 --> 27:43.211
so we can have
zombies that are dead,

27:43.244 --> 27:45.413
but we can also have
zombies that are alive.

27:45.447 --> 27:47.816
You can have zombies that drink
blood, but you can also have

27:47.849 --> 27:50.585
zombies that eat flesh
or just eat brains.

27:50.618 --> 27:52.253
You can have zombies
that are weak,

27:52.287 --> 27:55.690
you can have zombies that are
super strong, some zombies talk,

27:55.724 --> 28:00.362
most don't, some can
feel things, some can't.

28:00.395 --> 28:03.064
That movie "Wall-E,"
you know, the Pixar movie,

28:03.098 --> 28:05.400
I feel like that's kind of
a zombie movie, you know,

28:05.433 --> 28:07.969
when he goes up and the robot
finds all the earthlings

28:08.002 --> 28:11.639
that are just these fat blobs
hooked up to machines.

28:11.673 --> 28:14.542
Those are G-rated,
benevolent zombies.

28:14.576 --> 28:18.146
(screaming)

28:22.517 --> 28:24.486
We got into this
idea in "Reanimator,"

28:24.519 --> 28:27.455
that when they're reanimated,
that it somehow frees their

28:27.489 --> 28:30.658
libido and so that's
kind of what Dr. Hill is.

28:30.692 --> 28:33.628
This is a guy who is lusting
after the dean's daughter,

28:33.661 --> 28:39.100
but never was able to really
act on it until he's reanimated

28:39.134 --> 28:41.736
and in the course of the movie,
he converts himself as

28:41.770 --> 28:43.605
the improved Dr. Hill.

28:43.638 --> 28:47.442
In a way, it's a more
honest doctor.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.311
He almost breaks the
rules of the zombie

28:50.345 --> 28:53.548
because he has a stronger
idea of who he is.

28:53.581 --> 28:56.684
Deadites and zombies are
from different families,

28:56.718 --> 28:58.353
different species.

28:58.386 --> 29:01.289
A deadite is someone
who isn't necessarily dead,

29:01.322 --> 29:02.924
they just got possessed.

29:02.957 --> 29:05.593
It's weird, in "Evil Dead,"
we have both.

29:05.627 --> 29:08.897
In "Army of Darkness,"
we have an army of the dead,

29:08.930 --> 29:11.566
skeletons coming back
and they get to talk.

29:11.599 --> 29:13.902
I don't know how they do that
without a larynx, but you know.

29:13.935 --> 29:15.804
Bring on the wench!

29:15.837 --> 29:17.472
I think with like "Army of
Darkness," you didn't want

29:17.505 --> 29:20.008
to be alive or dead, you didn't
even want to be in that movie

29:20.041 --> 29:22.811
if you weren't Ash, because
everyone else is dead

29:22.844 --> 29:24.779
or possessed ultimately.

29:24.813 --> 29:27.615
Anybody that argues that because
something is alive can't be

29:27.649 --> 29:30.151
a zombie, obviously doesn't
remember the history

29:30.185 --> 29:32.654
about voodoo zombies
and how it all started.

29:32.687 --> 29:34.823
So I count the infected.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.291
Even though Danny Boyle
would say he didn't make

29:36.324 --> 29:38.960
a zombie movie,
but I'm sorry, he's wrong.

29:38.993 --> 29:40.695
He actually made a zombie movie.

29:42.397 --> 29:44.732
So the word zombie, as we spell
it in English, is pretty close

29:44.766 --> 29:48.403
to the Haitian/French "zombi,"
with just a terminal "I"

29:48.436 --> 29:51.706
and it probably comes
from a Congolese word,

29:51.739 --> 29:54.909
"Nzambi" with an "N."

29:54.943 --> 29:58.046
WOMAN: In some places,
there is a God named Nzambi.

29:58.079 --> 30:00.448
There was a revolutionary
hero named Nzambi.

30:00.482 --> 30:02.884
Some people have associated it
with a type of bird.

30:02.917 --> 30:06.187
Other people say there's
a plant called zombie.

30:06.221 --> 30:14.229
The zombie is somebody who
was supposed to be dead,

30:14.262 --> 30:16.331
but who's not.

30:16.364 --> 30:20.168
The origin of the zombie
in Africa was a separation

30:20.201 --> 30:25.073
of spirit from body and being
stuck in the mortal world.

30:25.106 --> 30:28.276
WOMAN: Dutch slavers,
Portuguese slavers heard tales

30:28.309 --> 30:31.045
of these fears that
the people had that

30:31.079 --> 30:35.416
witch doctors were capable
of stealing their souls.

30:35.450 --> 30:37.685
They would steal
a person's soul,

30:37.719 --> 30:39.521
put it in some kind of vessel,

30:39.554 --> 30:44.158
and then the body would keep
laboring for the witch doctor.

30:44.192 --> 30:47.829
Somewhere around
the colony of San Domingue,

30:47.862 --> 30:52.033
around the Haitian Revolution
of 1800, the word zombie

30:52.066 --> 30:54.636
and the soul capture
mythology come together

30:54.669 --> 30:56.538
and from that point on,
we're talking about

30:56.571 --> 30:59.140
the zombie as
a walking corpse.

31:00.742 --> 31:04.379
Zombification is just one of
the things they do as a form of

31:04.412 --> 31:10.552
punishment, where you go into a
form of slavery never to return.

31:10.585 --> 31:14.989
EMERANTE: Since he doesn't have
any life, they think he's dead.

31:15.023 --> 31:17.125
They bury the person.

31:17.158 --> 31:20.161
He has a certain
time to wake up.

31:20.194 --> 31:23.731
They take the person
out of where he is buried.

31:23.765 --> 31:32.473
He's still half awake and
half dead and that's a zombie.

31:33.708 --> 31:37.579
If you want to understand what
is a zombie, it is somebody

31:37.612 --> 31:44.285
who has one part of his identity
that has been torn down.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.822
You have a part of your
intelligence that's like a

31:47.855 --> 31:52.293
window and when it's torn down,
you lose your will,

31:52.327 --> 31:56.230
and that will lead the will
of doing bad things to others,

31:56.264 --> 31:59.467
and this is what Hollywood
has not understood

31:59.500 --> 32:02.904
is he cannot do harm.

32:02.937 --> 32:08.309
In other places, people who
commit crimes are usually put

32:08.343 --> 32:13.681
in a gas chamber or they are
killed by the electric chair,

32:13.715 --> 32:15.750
which to me is horrible.

32:15.783 --> 32:22.957
In fact, it is desecrating
the human being because

32:22.991 --> 32:26.728
a human being should be treated
with respect all the time.

32:26.761 --> 32:32.200
To me, zombification
is something spiritual.

32:38.139 --> 32:42.577
Wade Davis famously went down
from Harvard as an ethnobotanist

32:42.610 --> 32:45.780
and he did some research into
what could possibly be

32:45.813 --> 32:50.018
the scientific origins
of this tradition.

32:50.051 --> 32:53.154
SARAH: Davis theorized that
it was actually possible

32:53.187 --> 32:57.425
with a poison, it's called
tetrodotoxin, to poison someone,

32:57.458 --> 33:00.328
give them the appearance of
death that was so believable

33:00.361 --> 33:03.331
that you could then have them
buried, have a funeral for them,

33:03.364 --> 33:07.468
dig them up later, and then keep
them in a kind of comatose state

33:07.502 --> 33:10.538
so that they would only be able
to do the most basic commands,

33:10.571 --> 33:13.374
so that, in effect, you could
keep them as a slave,

33:13.408 --> 33:15.476
as a slave that people
would perceive to be

33:15.510 --> 33:18.846
nothing but the walking dead.

33:18.880 --> 33:22.617
KYLE: We have evidence that
people being turned into zombies

33:22.650 --> 33:25.753
was a real problem in Haiti
because part of the Haitian

33:25.787 --> 33:29.724
criminal code actually
has a law against

33:29.757 --> 33:31.459
turning people into zombies.

33:31.492 --> 33:33.294
It's actually on their books.

33:33.327 --> 33:37.632
It is illegal to poison someone,
bring them back,

33:37.665 --> 33:40.835
and sell them as slaves.

33:40.868 --> 33:43.171
SARAH: Even though we think of
this as an American monster,

33:43.204 --> 33:45.106
this is part of
a bigger mythology,

33:45.139 --> 33:48.509
one that isn't uniquely ours,
but is more global, one that

33:48.543 --> 33:52.313
really comes to us from Africa,
and from its inception,

33:52.346 --> 33:56.617
is very much about slavery and
from its sort of pivotal turn

33:56.651 --> 34:01.456
it makes in Haiti, becomes
a lot about slave rebellion.

34:05.259 --> 34:06.761
Damn Zombies.

34:06.794 --> 34:10.364
These nails cost me $2.49 a box.

34:10.398 --> 34:13.201
It's a good thing I had all
this scrap wood though.

34:13.234 --> 34:14.635
Well, that's that.

34:14.668 --> 34:17.638
I wonder if these zombies are
going to be the fast ones

34:17.672 --> 34:19.172
or the slow ones.

34:19.206 --> 34:21.943
I hope they're the slow ones
because I'm an old man.

34:21.976 --> 34:22.976
Oh, there's one now.

34:23.010 --> 34:25.313
Oh great, they're
the fast zombies.

34:25.346 --> 34:26.547
That's no good for me.

34:26.581 --> 34:28.549
Oh, wait a minute,
it's just a jogger.

34:28.583 --> 34:30.016
Whew...

34:30.051 --> 34:33.020
Well, that's good, but that
still doesn't answer my question

34:33.054 --> 34:35.223
whether or not
the zombies are fast ones.

34:35.255 --> 34:37.525
Oh, I guess they're slow ones.

34:37.558 --> 34:40.628
Well, that's good news for me
that they're slow ones, but

34:40.661 --> 34:44.966
wait, if you could just run away
from slow zombies with ease,

34:44.998 --> 34:48.536
then why aren't all new zombies
old people like me?

34:48.569 --> 34:52.273
In fact, how does a slow zombie
outbreak even get out of control

34:52.306 --> 34:53.975
in the first place?

34:54.007 --> 34:56.978
Now I could maybe see a slow
zombie outbreak getting out of

34:57.011 --> 35:01.182
control in a densely occupied
apartment building, but way out

35:01.215 --> 35:04.652
in the country where there's
just so much distance

35:04.685 --> 35:07.355
in between the infected
and the living?

35:07.388 --> 35:09.056
Well, not so much.

35:12.660 --> 35:14.295
STEVEN: The slow versus
fast debate is one of

35:14.328 --> 35:16.798
my very favorites
in zombie worlds.

35:16.831 --> 35:18.032
I'm partial to the slow zombies.

35:18.065 --> 35:19.834
I actually think
they're way scarier.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.369
If something's fast and
it's running after you,

35:21.402 --> 35:22.637
you just got to run.

35:22.670 --> 35:25.706
If someone is slow and shambling
towards you, you wait because

35:25.740 --> 35:27.775
we have this desire that
it's still human, right?

35:27.809 --> 35:30.244
Like you think, that looks like
my girlfriend, still looks like

35:30.278 --> 35:32.413
my girlfriend, she's stumbling
a little bit, but maybe

35:32.446 --> 35:34.415
it's my girlfriend with a broken
ankle, you don't know,

35:34.448 --> 35:36.684
and you let her get just
a little bit too close.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.219
All you've got to do is walk
slightly faster than her,

35:38.252 --> 35:39.921
but you don't.

35:39.954 --> 35:42.390
MAX: The slow zombie gives me
time to think about

35:42.423 --> 35:43.925
how I'm going to die.

35:43.958 --> 35:46.561
It's the difference between
getting shot and getting cancer.

35:46.594 --> 35:49.664
It's about considering all
those horrific possibilities.

35:50.665 --> 35:53.434
SIMON: The whole fast zombie
thing just misses the point.

35:53.467 --> 35:55.436
By removing any aggression from
them, by stopping them from

35:55.469 --> 35:58.873
being almost like screechy
and raptors running at you,

35:58.906 --> 36:03.377
they've become something
you can project depth onto.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.179
That's what's so great
about slow zombies is that

36:05.213 --> 36:07.615
you're given time
to get to know them

36:07.648 --> 36:10.518
before you shoot them
in the head.

36:10.551 --> 36:14.088
I do have a whole new level of
respect for horror film actors,

36:14.121 --> 36:18.426
but especially zombie horror
film actors because when they're

36:18.459 --> 36:22.096
slow, you really have to sell
the fear, you know what I mean?

36:22.129 --> 36:26.467
You have to sort of like create
scenarios in which you don't get

36:26.500 --> 36:30.004
away from these people that are
moving at the pace of a snail.

36:30.037 --> 36:31.739
Somebody once asked me,
would you write a zombie

36:31.772 --> 36:33.040
survival guide for fast zombies?

36:33.074 --> 36:34.375
I'm like, yeah, it would be
a pamphlet that we'd call

36:34.408 --> 36:35.676
"Kiss your ass goodbye."

36:35.710 --> 36:37.678
(laughter)

36:37.712 --> 36:42.083
I would argue that potentially
"Shaun of the Dead" had a lot

36:42.116 --> 36:47.221
of influence in kind of killing
the slow zombie in movies.

36:47.255 --> 36:50.491
If you have two bumbling idiots
who can throw records at zombies

36:50.524 --> 36:53.628
and sort of accidentally kill
them, it sort of causes problems

36:53.661 --> 36:56.030
in terms of trying to make
the slow zombie really scary.

36:56.063 --> 36:57.798
TOM: This makes me
think of when I directed

36:57.832 --> 37:00.568
"Night of the Living Dead,"
we hired a movement instructor

37:00.601 --> 37:02.870
because my idea was
if you're a zombie,

37:02.904 --> 37:06.207
then you leave your body.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.043
It's like if your body is hung
on a fence and something comes

37:09.076 --> 37:12.747
and takes over the body, that's
never moved a human body before

37:12.780 --> 37:16.717
and tries to move and walk,
but it was laughable.

37:16.751 --> 37:21.422
People were doing all kinds
of stupid weird shit with it.

37:21.455 --> 37:24.625
Just walk slow, okay,
just walk slow.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.928
Because as you know, George
Romero believes in slow zombies.

37:26.961 --> 37:29.597
He sells bumper stickers
that say, "Fast Zombies Suck."

37:29.630 --> 37:34.969
My basic objection to fast
zombies is that it's impossible!

37:35.002 --> 37:36.871
If they're dead,
if they're dead.

37:36.904 --> 37:38.539
SIMON: You know, there's an
argument that Bill Hingmen,

37:38.572 --> 37:40.675
who played the very first zombie
in "Night of the Living Dead,"

37:40.708 --> 37:42.710
he was pretty spritely
as a zombie.

37:42.743 --> 37:45.413
He wasn't moving
particularly slowly.

37:45.446 --> 37:48.816
The beginning of zombie
evolution started with

37:48.849 --> 37:51.919
quite a quick-footed zombie
to be honest.

37:51.953 --> 37:53.988
GEORGE: When we were making
"Night of the Living Dead,"

37:54.021 --> 37:57.692
we had no sense of rules.

37:57.725 --> 38:02.396
It wasn't until I finally agreed
to do another one that I said,

38:02.430 --> 38:06.334
well wait, we've got to have
a little process going in.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.835
We have to have something.

38:09.036 --> 38:13.240
I know that Bill moves pretty
quickly so I think I've sort of

38:13.274 --> 38:17.011
violated my own rules there,
but I wasn't even...

38:17.044 --> 38:18.579
I didn't even have rules then.

38:18.612 --> 38:23.150
Zombie purists sometimes
can get quite adamant

38:23.184 --> 38:24.885
about their feelings.

38:24.919 --> 38:31.292
I had a woman one time chastise
me for making my living

38:31.325 --> 38:37.598
in horror and not knowing
that zombies don't eat brains.

38:37.631 --> 38:40.534
These movies come out and we get
these like really particular

38:40.568 --> 38:44.238
zombie enthusiasts that will rip
them apart on a message board.

38:44.271 --> 38:47.808
I'm like, come on guys,
it's a porno.

38:47.842 --> 38:50.978
S.G.: The zombie purists want
their zombies to be slow and

38:51.012 --> 38:54.248
shambling and I like to say that
they get kind of Dr. Seuss

38:54.281 --> 38:56.217
"Green Eggs and Ham"
about their zombies...

38:56.250 --> 38:58.185
They do not like them when
they run, they do not like them

38:58.219 --> 39:00.087
when they're fun, they do not
like them with a heart,

39:00.121 --> 39:01.455
they do not like them
to be smart.

39:01.489 --> 39:04.892
They just want them to be slow
and shambling and mindless.

39:04.925 --> 39:07.762
Fast zombies, slow zombies,
if zombies want to shoot lasers

39:07.795 --> 39:09.663
out of their eyes and
it works in the story,

39:09.697 --> 39:10.898
I think that's fantastic.

39:10.931 --> 39:12.433
If you're a dead guy and you're
walking around, maybe you're

39:12.466 --> 39:14.769
eating people, maybe you're not
eating people, I don't know.

39:14.802 --> 39:17.371
If you're a dead guy walking
around, you're a zombie.

39:17.405 --> 39:20.408
For me, "28 Days Later" was
the first time I saw them

39:20.441 --> 39:23.511
sped up and I just thought
that was genius.

39:23.544 --> 39:25.146
How did we not think
of this sooner?

39:25.179 --> 39:28.449
Zombies have been around forever
and no one has ever thought

39:28.482 --> 39:29.850
to just make them sprint.

39:29.884 --> 39:31.519
I mean, why wouldn't they?

39:31.552 --> 39:34.155
If they want the food,
they just fucking go get it.

39:34.188 --> 39:36.090
So that was truly terrifying.

39:36.123 --> 39:39.193
I don't think there was anything
charming about those zombies.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.929
Fuck fast zombies.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.465
I fucking hate fast zombies.

39:44.498 --> 39:45.499
I hate them.

39:45.533 --> 39:48.502
Now "28 Days Later" --
not a zombie movie.

39:48.536 --> 39:53.707
Infection, those people were
infected, they aren't dead,

39:53.741 --> 39:56.177
so not a zombie movie,
just for the record.

39:56.210 --> 39:58.479
Slow zombies don't cut it
for us often anymore.

39:58.512 --> 40:00.781
Our fears are more intense.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.283
The world is faster.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.884
Our technology is faster.

40:03.918 --> 40:07.221
We need a faster zombie and
I think a great example of it

40:07.254 --> 40:09.190
is bringing us all the way
up to the present day

40:09.223 --> 40:11.992
and the "World War Z" film
adaptation, where you see

40:12.026 --> 40:18.232
a virtual tsunami of zombie
bodies just rushing mindlessly,

40:18.265 --> 40:20.067
they're not even human anymore,

40:20.101 --> 40:22.436
they're not even distinguishable
as individuals.

40:22.470 --> 40:27.441
They're just a mass of flesh
just washing over us.

40:27.475 --> 40:29.243
So I was asked to be
a scientific consultant

40:29.276 --> 40:30.945
on "World War Z."

40:30.978 --> 40:34.248
I had to remit to think
about zombies as if

40:34.281 --> 40:35.950
they were the product
of natural selection.

40:35.983 --> 40:39.120
If natural selection is at play,
we should expect to see very,

40:39.153 --> 40:40.488
very different things.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.723
We should expect to see
cooperative behavior

40:42.756 --> 40:44.825
among zombies.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.628
So before they get bitten,
they're individual humans

40:47.661 --> 40:50.564
with individual interests and
different genetic relatedness,

40:50.598 --> 40:52.099
so they should be selfish.

40:52.133 --> 40:55.569
Once they're bitten, it doesn't
matter which zombie bites

40:55.603 --> 40:59.039
the next human, so long as
the virus gets there.

40:59.073 --> 41:02.543
We see many examples in nature
of groups of organisms

41:02.576 --> 41:07.348
moving more quickly when the
individual desire is subjugated

41:07.381 --> 41:09.884
to the success of the group.

41:14.922 --> 41:19.260
You know, the milestone in
zombie culture is the failure

41:19.293 --> 41:21.762
of the producer of
"Night of the Living Dead"

41:21.795 --> 41:25.332
to renew the copyright because
what that did is it put

41:25.366 --> 41:28.602
the picture in public domain and
meant that it was going to play

41:28.636 --> 41:34.642
on every cable TV station and
every midnight movie possible.

41:34.675 --> 41:38.779
Anybody who had a videotape of
that film could put it on

41:38.812 --> 41:41.882
their local television station
and play it on Halloween

41:41.916 --> 41:45.152
or at midnight, and they did,
and so many other imitators

41:45.186 --> 41:48.422
came along and parody
filmmakers came along.

41:48.455 --> 41:50.591
Kill the brain,
kill the brain.

41:50.624 --> 41:51.692
Lock and load.

41:55.563 --> 41:57.998
And even great filmmakers
like David Cronenberg

41:58.032 --> 42:00.134
owe an enormous debt to Romero,

42:00.167 --> 42:02.770
an enormous debt to the
"Night of the Living Dead."

42:02.803 --> 42:06.473
Zombies are definitely part
of mainstream culture now.

42:06.507 --> 42:08.309
I mean, there can hardly
be anybody left,

42:08.342 --> 42:10.744
at least in the
English speaking world,

42:10.778 --> 42:14.148
who hasn't seen a
zombie movie by now.

42:14.181 --> 42:18.052
I think the advent of video
games and third-person

42:18.085 --> 42:21.088
shoot 'em up games
did more for the zombie genre

42:21.121 --> 42:23.490
than a couple movies even.

42:23.524 --> 42:26.260
I mean, I bought a Sega just
so I could have one of those

42:26.293 --> 42:29.897
shitty orange guns and
I could shoot at zombies.

42:29.930 --> 42:31.632
Zombies have even infected
video games that are not

42:31.665 --> 42:32.933
zombie video games.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.436
The "Call of Duty" franchise
is probably the most famous

42:35.469 --> 42:38.072
which has banked through
its last few iterations

42:38.105 --> 42:40.941
on zombie mode as being
one of its big draws.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.477
When zombies are so popular
that they're going to shoehorn

42:43.510 --> 42:47.214
zombies into non-zombie games,
we know that we've reached

42:47.248 --> 42:51.385
a point of saturation in our
culture, triumph of the zombies.

42:51.418 --> 42:55.155
GEORGE: You could put on
"Sesame Street," a zombie,

42:55.189 --> 42:57.524
and kids would know what it was.

42:57.558 --> 43:00.527
Kids would know what it was,
a zombie, oh yeah.

43:00.561 --> 43:04.398
Zombies don't eat meat
because they can't have meat.

43:04.431 --> 43:06.367
They only eat your brains.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.102
When they eat your brains,

43:08.135 --> 43:13.907
the human brains
come in their brains.

43:13.941 --> 43:16.210
STEVEN: So in the last probably
two and a half, three years,

43:16.243 --> 43:19.980
they've gone from an underground
rabid cult following --

43:20.014 --> 43:22.516
people love them --
to this huge pop culture

43:22.549 --> 43:23.584
mainstream following.

43:23.617 --> 43:25.119
You just got to put the word
zombie on something

43:25.152 --> 43:26.587
and it sells.

43:26.620 --> 43:28.856
What if say technically
you were not alive,

43:28.889 --> 43:31.258
like maybe you
were undead?

43:31.292 --> 43:32.393
Like a zombie?

43:32.426 --> 43:34.795
Whoa, let's not go
putting labels on people.

43:37.398 --> 43:38.732
I'm a zombie.

43:38.766 --> 43:40.367
I'm here to tell you
how to best prepare

43:40.401 --> 43:42.169
for the zombie apocalypse.

43:42.202 --> 43:44.438
Don't be afraid to
bash our heads in.

43:44.471 --> 43:49.677
We could easily be taken out
with a well-thrown rock...

43:49.710 --> 43:52.546
or a two-by-four.

43:52.579 --> 43:54.848
You want to know the best way
to survive the apocalypse?

43:54.882 --> 43:58.085
Get the right health insurance.

43:58.118 --> 44:00.921
This interview with a zombie
brought to you by the good folks

44:00.954 --> 44:03.324
at Rocky Mountain Health Plans.

44:03.357 --> 44:06.260
You see them in commercials now,
you see them in movie

44:06.293 --> 44:09.330
theatre ads, I mean,
zombies are everywhere, man.

44:09.363 --> 44:12.099
You want to talk about when is
the zombie apocalypse coming?

44:12.132 --> 44:13.567
It's here.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.636
No! It's Zombie-Con weekend!

44:15.669 --> 44:17.438
(screaming)

44:19.440 --> 44:21.475
There's got to be
more of us out there.

44:25.012 --> 44:27.348
No! No!

44:31.919 --> 44:34.822
The number one show on cable
that beat our show,

44:34.855 --> 44:38.225
"Burn Notice," which was
the number one show on cable,

44:38.258 --> 44:39.893
is zombies.

44:46.934 --> 44:53.340
How we got to be so
popular is blind luck.

44:53.374 --> 44:55.309
It's as simple as that.

44:55.342 --> 45:00.114
Somehow we managed to tap in
on some sort of public zeitgeist

45:00.147 --> 45:05.853
that wanted this sort of product
at that sort of time.

45:05.886 --> 45:09.523
I'll meet somebody on the street
and a guy will come up and say,

45:09.556 --> 45:12.259
oh my God, I love "The Walking
Dead," stay right here,

45:12.292 --> 45:15.529
and he'll run over and he'll
bring his wife over and his wife

45:15.562 --> 45:19.233
will be more excited about
"The Walking Dead" than he is!

45:19.266 --> 45:20.868
I've always been uncomfortable
with the success of

45:20.901 --> 45:22.302
"The Walking Dead."

45:22.336 --> 45:25.706
When it debuted as a comic, it
was like, oh wait, this thing is

45:25.739 --> 45:28.675
way more popular than it should
be and it just kept getting more

45:28.709 --> 45:31.378
and more popular and then when
the show happened, I honestly

45:31.412 --> 45:33.947
didn't think the show was
going to be successful at all.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.816
I was hoping and praying
that the show would be

45:35.849 --> 45:38.452
just successful enough
to continue.

45:38.485 --> 45:41.221
It honestly makes no
sense to me whatsoever.

45:41.255 --> 45:44.291
I don't know how this show
is as popular as it is.

45:45.893 --> 45:49.396
They're joining the ranks of
the blockbuster pop culture

45:49.430 --> 45:52.766
icons, like superheroes
and action heroes.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.935
S.G.: Werewolves are kind of
like the jocks of monsters.

45:54.968 --> 45:57.204
They're full of testosterone
and sprouting hair all over

45:57.237 --> 46:01.175
the place and full of rage and
screaming and running around.

46:01.208 --> 46:04.111
Vampires are kind of
like the fraternity boys.

46:04.144 --> 46:07.548
They're always sort of suave and
slick and trying to convince you

46:07.581 --> 46:11.051
to get into bed with them
so they can drink your blood,

46:11.084 --> 46:13.220
and zombies are kind of like
the nerds and the geeks,

46:13.253 --> 46:15.756
you know, they don't
get the girls,

46:15.789 --> 46:17.891
but they don't have
any ulterior motives.

46:17.925 --> 46:19.226
They wear their emotions
on their sleeves.

46:19.259 --> 46:21.228
They say, I am a zombie and
I want to eat your brains.

46:21.261 --> 46:24.064
It's a monster that's
completely honest.

46:24.097 --> 46:29.670
A vampire seduces, a zombie
feeds, a zombie goes after you,

46:29.703 --> 46:31.638
and some people,
they're turned on by that.

46:31.672 --> 46:33.574
They're turned on by
relentless desire.

46:33.607 --> 46:35.943
They want to be desired
like nothing else.

46:35.976 --> 46:39.646
You know, nobody wants to be
raped in real life but a lot of

46:39.680 --> 46:42.916
people have rape fantasies
and sex with the zombie

46:42.950 --> 46:44.551
is probably the ultimate rape.

46:47.287 --> 46:49.456
Shit, another walker.

46:49.490 --> 46:51.925
Don't worry,
I got this one.

46:51.959 --> 46:55.095
No Glenn, put
your dick away.

46:55.128 --> 46:58.465
It is tough to make a zombie
porn because you kind of

46:58.499 --> 47:04.404
have to violate every law of
porn and then you're also,

47:04.438 --> 47:07.608
at the same time, violating
all these zombie laws.

47:09.309 --> 47:10.978
It's been some day,
hasn't it, son?

47:11.011 --> 47:12.246
Yeah.

47:12.279 --> 47:15.749
You got lost and then united,
had a threesome with your mom

47:15.782 --> 47:17.784
and my best friend.

47:17.818 --> 47:22.356
Now Carl, I've got to know,
do you have it in you to go over

47:22.389 --> 47:26.627
there and fuck that girl,
and kill her with your cum?

47:28.362 --> 47:30.230
JOANNA: "Walking Dead"
definitely sold the most

47:30.264 --> 47:33.534
out of probably any other porno
we've ever made.

47:35.802 --> 47:39.673
People love playing the role and
I think it is also an element

47:39.706 --> 47:43.610
of domesticating it,
making it safer, making it fun.

47:43.644 --> 47:44.811
Zombie culture has
really blossomed.

47:44.845 --> 47:47.848
You have zombie walks or
zombie crawls, if you prefer,

47:47.881 --> 47:51.585
zombie runs, zombie fashion
shows, zombie beauty shows,

47:51.618 --> 47:53.787
zombie weddings,
zombie engagements,

47:53.820 --> 47:57.524
zombie birthday parties,
zombie car washes.

47:57.558 --> 48:00.193
I would never have let
a zombie wash my car.

48:00.227 --> 48:01.929
(laughter)

48:04.064 --> 48:06.233
Are you ready to
meet your maker?

48:06.266 --> 48:07.901
You're not gonna because
you're gonna come back

48:07.935 --> 48:10.337
to be a flesh eating beast!

48:10.370 --> 48:12.839
Are you ready?

48:12.873 --> 48:15.242
Get ready to tread or die today!

48:15.275 --> 48:21.848
Runners, take your mark,
set, banzai!

48:21.882 --> 48:23.517
Suckers!

48:23.550 --> 48:33.594
♪

48:33.594 --> 48:40.867
♪

48:40.901 --> 48:43.170
I made it! I made it!
I made it! I made it!

48:50.944 --> 48:56.550
I was coming to the first annual
Seattle Zombie-Con and a couple

48:56.583 --> 48:58.518
approached me who were
going to the convention.

48:58.552 --> 49:06.259
They wanted to be married by me
as zombies, and I'm like,

49:06.293 --> 49:10.197
"But you want this
to count, right?"

49:10.230 --> 49:12.633
And I thought, you know,
their poor family.

49:12.666 --> 49:15.268
This is a sacred thing,
getting married, you know?

49:15.302 --> 49:18.271
And they're doing this as
zombies and getting the idiot

49:18.305 --> 49:23.844
guy who played Ash to marry them
but then you see their family!

49:23.877 --> 49:26.647
Who gives this zombie woman
to be married to

49:26.680 --> 49:29.316
this lucky zombie man?

49:29.349 --> 49:30.584
(growling)

49:30.617 --> 49:35.188
Alright, dad,
go take a nap.

49:35.222 --> 49:38.291
The father couldn't sit down
because he came as a guy who had

49:38.325 --> 49:44.164
a spike that had impaled him and
all the family came as zombies.

49:44.197 --> 49:47.234
Zombies don't think
about what they're doing,

49:47.267 --> 49:50.404
they just do it.

49:50.437 --> 49:52.172
Am I right, zombies?

49:52.205 --> 49:53.840
(cheering)

49:53.874 --> 49:55.976
Come on, you freaks!

49:56.009 --> 49:57.844
Now shut up,
I'm still talking.

49:57.878 --> 50:00.847
Anybody needs zombies married,
I guess I'm your go-to guy,

50:00.881 --> 50:03.617
but I've only performed one
because they're going to get

50:03.650 --> 50:07.654
really expensive now because
it's just too weird.

50:09.856 --> 50:13.326
Zombie fans, I think,
are, I don't know,

50:13.360 --> 50:16.830
I can't identify
who zombie fans are.

50:16.863 --> 50:18.532
Who are zombie fans?

50:18.565 --> 50:20.634
Are they fans of the genre?

50:20.667 --> 50:22.436
Are they fans of horror movies?

50:22.469 --> 50:25.906
All these people that come out
for zombie walks, what is it?

50:25.939 --> 50:30.811
What is it that
appeals to zombie fans?

50:30.844 --> 50:34.147
I think that anyone that made
"Dawn of the Dead" would have to

50:34.181 --> 50:37.984
understand what zombie
culture is about.

50:38.018 --> 50:40.754
There is so much in that movie
that's just about humans

50:40.787 --> 50:42.556
and human nature.

50:42.589 --> 50:47.861
You have to know, like,
you have to see that.

50:47.894 --> 50:48.495
I don't know.

50:48.528 --> 50:50.063
That doesn't make sense.

50:50.097 --> 50:51.898
Don't put that in there.

50:51.932 --> 50:54.067
(laughter)

50:54.101 --> 50:57.270
TOM: I've seen a crowd of people
go into the middle of a square

50:57.304 --> 51:01.007
as zombies and then all of
a sudden, "Thriller" will blast

51:01.041 --> 51:02.342
and they all do
the "Thriller" dance,

51:02.375 --> 51:07.080
that I would like to participate
in, but not the zombie walk.

51:07.114 --> 51:08.782
I don't get it,
I'm sorry.

51:08.815 --> 51:11.084
Well done to you people
dressed as zombies.

51:11.118 --> 51:13.353
Good for you.

51:13.386 --> 51:14.488
I don't get it.

51:14.521 --> 51:17.324
That would be like me dressing
up as someone with Ebola.

51:17.357 --> 51:19.593
(laughter)

51:19.626 --> 51:20.861
It'd be like, come on.

51:20.894 --> 51:23.563
There's going to be 16,000
people in Denver all walking,

51:23.597 --> 51:25.832
pretending that they have
testicular cancer, come on!

51:25.866 --> 51:27.200
(laughter)

51:27.234 --> 51:29.503
WOMAN: It's nothing new
that zombies walk,

51:29.536 --> 51:30.737
that's just what they do.

51:30.771 --> 51:33.507
And I never say that anyone
ever invented the zombie walk

51:33.540 --> 51:38.411
because that's their kind of
monster character.

51:38.445 --> 51:40.747
I think maybe the very first
time I ever dressed up as

51:40.781 --> 51:44.751
a zombie was for the first
annual Denver Zombie Crawl.

51:44.785 --> 51:47.687
There's probably like 15
or 20 people, and I was like,

51:47.721 --> 51:50.824
God, this is so cool!
What a great idea.

51:50.857 --> 51:53.593
We're all going to dress like
zombies and pound on the windows

51:53.627 --> 51:56.062
while people are eating dinner
and this is the coolest thing

51:56.096 --> 51:58.965
ever, and then the next year,
it was like, oh my God,

51:58.999 --> 52:01.902
there's like 50, 75 people --
cool!

52:01.935 --> 52:05.205
And then the next year,
it was hundreds and I think

52:05.238 --> 52:08.775
last year was 15
or 17,000 people --

52:08.809 --> 52:12.145
families, professionals,
children.

52:12.179 --> 52:14.748
It's amazing.

52:14.781 --> 52:17.651
It's a punk thing,
it's almost punk, right?

52:17.684 --> 52:20.320
Making a statement, saying,
I don't want to be part of

52:20.353 --> 52:22.556
this life, I'll be
a part of that life,

52:22.589 --> 52:24.524
but I don't want to be
a part of this life.

52:24.558 --> 52:27.260
I think that's
really what it is.

52:27.294 --> 52:29.496
It's frustration, man.

52:29.529 --> 52:30.897
SARAH:
I mean, it's all in good fun.

52:30.931 --> 52:33.533
It's play, but I feel like
underneath that is a little bit

52:33.567 --> 52:36.603
of danger and there's a message
that's being sent that says,

52:36.636 --> 52:40.674
you know, if we wanted to, we
have the capacity to organize.

52:40.707 --> 52:44.144
Here we just got 10,000 zombies
out in this public square

52:44.177 --> 52:47.447
so I felt like it's a kind of
tacit message to our government.

52:47.480 --> 52:49.683
DR. BLOCK: If you're into
zombies, the zombie walk

52:49.716 --> 52:51.117
is like date night.

52:51.151 --> 52:53.286
If you're dressed as a zombie,
sometimes that helps,

52:53.320 --> 52:56.456
especially if you're a
little looks challenged.

52:56.489 --> 52:59.359
It's very liberating to
be purposefully ugly.

52:59.392 --> 53:01.094
You can let your Id out.

53:01.127 --> 53:03.964
WOMAN: I do think corpses
are a little bit attractive.

53:03.997 --> 53:05.632
I was sitting next
to one earlier

53:05.665 --> 53:08.101
and I'm going to tell you,
he was pretty handsome.

53:08.134 --> 53:09.302
I liked holding his hand.

53:09.336 --> 53:12.973
He was big, kind of buff,
even though he was bony.

53:13.006 --> 53:15.575
I think people are thinking
too hard these days about,

53:15.609 --> 53:17.711
"Whoa, what's this
zombie phenomenon?"

53:17.744 --> 53:20.914
People love to dress up, they
love to be other characters,

53:20.947 --> 53:22.949
they love to escape
from themselves.

53:22.983 --> 53:26.086
The costumes are amazing,
they're cinematic,

53:26.119 --> 53:27.254
there's incredible gore.

53:27.287 --> 53:29.689
There's incredible creativity.

53:29.723 --> 53:33.460
Where else can you
see a Lego zombie?

53:33.493 --> 53:35.629
I don't know why people
come out and do it.

53:35.662 --> 53:39.866
I have to pay union wages
to get them to come.

53:39.900 --> 53:44.838
(laughter and applause)

53:44.871 --> 53:46.539
I think it's about
getting connected again.

53:46.573 --> 53:48.475
It's so interesting to me,
like, I see these zombie walks

53:48.508 --> 53:51.778
and nobody is tweeting
or emailing or texting.

53:51.811 --> 53:53.580
They're actually talking to
each other and I know that

53:53.613 --> 53:55.382
sounds a little too peace
and love and all that,

53:55.415 --> 53:57.784
but it actually reminds me --
I used to follow Grateful Dead

53:57.817 --> 54:00.320
around when I was in college
and it reminds me the most

54:00.353 --> 54:01.588
of a Grateful Dead show.

54:01.621 --> 54:03.623
Not in the way that people are
checked out, but in the way that

54:03.657 --> 54:05.158
people are actually
nice to each other.

54:05.191 --> 54:06.660
That doesn't happen very often.

54:06.693 --> 54:09.229
It doesn't happen at a ballgame,
but it happens when people

54:09.262 --> 54:12.165
dress up like the walking dead
and walk down the street.

54:13.433 --> 54:16.036
KYLE: Sometimes it's more fun
to watch the audience

54:16.069 --> 54:19.072
than the participants because
whether they know it or not,

54:19.105 --> 54:21.942
the audience just
became participants.

54:21.975 --> 54:24.344
The great thing about the zombie
is, you get bit by a zombie,

54:24.377 --> 54:27.013
then you're one of them and
you're part of this collective,

54:27.047 --> 54:28.448
you're part of this hoard.

54:28.481 --> 54:31.318
Well, zombie fandom
works the same way.

54:31.351 --> 54:32.953
I think that's kind of
the cool thing that's coming

54:32.986 --> 54:34.154
from all of this.

54:34.187 --> 54:38.158
Maybe people are getting a
skinned knee when they're doing

54:38.191 --> 54:40.860
the zombie obstacle course,
but they're having fun,

54:40.894 --> 54:43.663
they're having a good time,
so to a very small degree,

54:43.697 --> 54:45.799
they're improving
people's lives.

54:45.832 --> 54:47.801
(laughing)

55:05.819 --> 55:08.321
Bravo 2 to Bravo 1,
switch has been pulled.

55:08.355 --> 55:10.824
Any change in
situation upstairs?

Stay low, watch your heads.

55:40.787 --> 55:43.690
Single file up the
stairs, gentleman.

55:43.723 --> 55:45.558
Guys, I need two eyes
on this doorway behind me.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.727
Make sure it's clear.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.596
Holy shit!

55:49.629 --> 55:51.931
What the fuck is that?

55:51.965 --> 55:54.801
The armor that that thing
has got built into it

55:54.834 --> 55:56.336
will take a 50 caliber.

55:56.369 --> 55:59.305
Our shotguns are gonna
do dick and squat.

55:59.339 --> 56:03.610
Anything happens, you go
there as fast as you can.

56:03.643 --> 56:05.478
No dicking around, yeah?

56:05.512 --> 56:14.487

56:14.521 --> 56:16.790
Move!

56:16.823 --> 56:20.994

56:21.027 --> 56:23.530
This is an event where we
provide a total immersive

56:23.563 --> 56:24.864
zombie experience.

56:24.898 --> 56:26.266
From the minute they
arrive at the event,

56:26.299 --> 56:29.035
they are thrown into basically
a narrative storyline.

56:29.069 --> 56:32.172
Everyone's got an idea
of how they would handle

56:32.205 --> 56:33.573
a zombie apocalypse.

56:33.606 --> 56:35.408
We're giving people the
opportunity to try that out.

56:35.442 --> 56:36.976
(screaming)

56:40.080 --> 56:43.850
MAX: "The Zombie Survival Guide"
came about during the Y2K scare

56:43.883 --> 56:45.085
of the late '90s.

56:45.118 --> 56:47.787
That was a time when people were
starting to prepare for this

56:47.821 --> 56:52.826
sort of nebulous apocalypse that
they didn't really understand.

56:52.859 --> 56:55.862
America specifically had been
experiencing the largest

56:55.895 --> 56:59.132
post-war boom in its history
and times were good, but there

56:59.165 --> 57:03.703
was this feeling that times were
about to change and all these

57:03.736 --> 57:07.407
survival guides were coming out
and I noticed that none of them

57:07.440 --> 57:09.909
were addressing my fears.

57:09.943 --> 57:13.580
Granted, zombies are not real,
but that certainly didn't stop

57:13.613 --> 57:15.782
anybody else from publishing
survival guides about all

57:15.815 --> 57:18.118
the other things that were going
to happen that were not real.

57:18.151 --> 57:21.154
Zombie movies are essentially
disaster movies and I think

57:21.187 --> 57:25.125
there has been a sense from 9/11
on, that the system is breaking

57:25.158 --> 57:28.795
down, and we want to know what
the end game is psychologically.

57:28.828 --> 57:31.297
We want to know what is all this
leading to and the problem is

57:31.331 --> 57:35.368
if you watch a movie where the
catalyst for that disaster is

57:35.401 --> 57:38.371
real, like a real nuclear war
or a real plague or a real

57:38.404 --> 57:41.141
global financial meltdown,
you will not sleep that night.

57:41.174 --> 57:45.211
So if the catalyst is something
like zombies, then you can say,

57:45.245 --> 57:47.614
oh wow, look, neighbors are
stabbing each other and there

57:47.647 --> 57:49.983
are no services and FEMA is
incompetent and the president

57:50.016 --> 57:51.951
is flying over going,
"That's peculiar."

57:51.985 --> 57:53.386
(laughter)

57:53.419 --> 57:55.655
But it's zombies,
so that's totally okay

57:55.688 --> 57:56.756
and then I'm going
to go to sleep.

58:03.196 --> 58:04.664
What would be your first
order of business

58:04.697 --> 58:06.166
in a zombie apocalypse?

58:06.199 --> 58:08.868
Find some place that's fortified
that I can control what comes in

58:08.902 --> 58:11.404
and what comes out
because if I can stop them

58:11.437 --> 58:13.840
before they even come in...

58:13.873 --> 58:16.876
Would it be a boat?
What do you think?

58:16.910 --> 58:18.344
I don't know, never
thought about the boat.

58:18.378 --> 58:19.512
You've got to think
about these things.

58:19.546 --> 58:20.580
Right.

58:20.613 --> 58:22.882
Everyone has their chance
today to be prepared.

58:22.916 --> 58:24.584
You make the choice now
whether you're going to be

58:24.617 --> 58:26.452
prepped to live
or prepped to die.

58:26.486 --> 58:29.322
Top five things that you would
suggest people prioritize

58:29.355 --> 58:31.090
when they're
creating a prep kit.

58:31.124 --> 58:33.626
Water purification and
filtration equipment,

58:33.660 --> 58:37.530
first aid if you get injured,
security hugely important,

58:37.564 --> 58:43.069
shelter and warmth,
and shortwave radio, ham radio.

58:43.102 --> 58:45.338
What is your motto at
Atlas Survival Shelters?

58:45.371 --> 58:47.440
Better prepared than scared.

58:47.473 --> 58:51.444
I build long-term survival
shelters for private individuals

58:51.477 --> 58:53.513
so that their family
has a chance to survive

58:53.546 --> 58:55.148
what's coming
down the road.

58:55.181 --> 58:56.616
And is something
coming down the road?

58:56.649 --> 58:58.351
I believe something is
coming down the road.

58:58.384 --> 58:59.719
a lot of people do.

58:59.752 --> 59:00.954
What would you say
if somebody said that

59:00.987 --> 59:02.589
one of those threats
was zombies?

59:02.622 --> 59:03.690
Say that again.

59:03.723 --> 59:05.692
What would you say if one of
those threats was zombies?

59:05.725 --> 59:06.759
What if they're fast?

59:06.793 --> 59:09.229
If they're fast, you could
spend upwards of $10,000.

59:09.262 --> 59:11.464
So you're fucked
if they're fast.

59:11.497 --> 59:15.034
Yeah...
you're fucked.

59:15.068 --> 59:18.004
Your shelters are nuclear,
biological, and chemical class

59:18.037 --> 59:21.174
survival shelters,
but are they zombie proof?

59:21.207 --> 59:22.775
From the television zombies?

59:22.809 --> 59:23.876
Yeah, are your
shelters --

59:23.910 --> 59:26.079
From the television zombies,
they're zombie proof,

59:26.112 --> 59:27.347
100 percent.

59:30.817 --> 59:32.518
There are people who
are always asking me,

59:32.552 --> 59:35.021
do you have a zombie
survival plan?

59:35.054 --> 59:36.522
And I'm like, no,
I live in San Francisco.

59:36.556 --> 59:38.258
I don't even have an
earthquake survival kit,

59:38.291 --> 59:40.159
so I'm not exactly on
Darwin's short list

59:40.193 --> 59:42.028
for making it through this.

59:42.061 --> 59:45.064
I always think getting to the
attic would be a good thing to

59:45.098 --> 59:49.235
do because they can't climb and
you could lift up the ladder

59:49.269 --> 59:50.603
and they wouldn't know you were
up there if you were real quiet

59:50.637 --> 59:52.205
but you're going
to starve to death.

59:52.238 --> 59:53.473
People make noise.

59:53.506 --> 59:57.377
I've got a little girl now and
I can't keep her quiet anywhere,

59:57.410 --> 01:00:00.380
let alone in an attic
in a house full of zombies,

01:00:00.413 --> 01:00:03.483
so I think you'd have to get up,
I think you'd go north.

01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:08.554
Once I'm sure that civilization
is as screwed up as, you know,

01:00:08.588 --> 01:00:11.224
it would be in
a zombie apocalypse,

01:00:11.257 --> 01:00:13.126
I would jump off
the tallest building.

01:00:13.159 --> 01:00:14.594
I don't want to live like that.

01:00:14.627 --> 01:00:16.296
I don't like being hungry.

01:00:16.329 --> 01:00:17.497
You ever been hungry?

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:18.731
It's not fun.

01:00:18.765 --> 01:00:21.100
I would hang on as long as I
thought I could protect my wife

01:00:21.134 --> 01:00:25.471
and kids, and then once that
didn't pan out because

01:00:25.505 --> 01:00:29.575
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't
pan out, then I would go.

01:00:29.609 --> 01:00:34.247
I think I would just have to
run away and call my children

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.150
and wish them luck.

01:00:37.183 --> 01:00:39.118
Do the best you can
where you are.

01:00:39.152 --> 01:00:40.620
I'll do what I can where I am.

01:00:40.653 --> 01:00:41.921
I ain't coming to get you.

01:00:41.954 --> 01:00:44.557
Sorry dude, you had a good life.

01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:48.094
(laughing)

01:00:48.127 --> 01:00:50.463
I love my family more than
Bruce Campbell loves his family,

01:00:50.496 --> 01:00:51.531
it's official.

01:00:51.564 --> 01:00:54.067
I'm not a very good shot,
I certainly can't shoot

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.235
a crossbow, I'm not
a very good fisherman.

01:00:56.269 --> 01:00:58.037
I would be like Homer.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.506
Homer was blind and wandered
around a really dangerous

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:03.009
landscape with a bunch of futile
lords and somehow stayed alive

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:04.777
by telling people stories and
was smart enough never to

01:01:04.811 --> 01:01:05.945
have them end, right?

01:01:05.978 --> 01:01:07.547
Because if then ended,
then they'd kill him.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.452
I would drive here, I would
do zombie makeup on myself

01:01:12.485 --> 01:01:16.189
and then just walk around.

01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:20.693
The only problem would be if
some dude with a shotgun saw me,

01:01:20.727 --> 01:01:22.061
he'd shoot me in the head
and then it would kind of

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:23.496
defeat the purpose.

01:01:23.529 --> 01:01:25.665
Are zombies on the news coming?
Did I miss something?

01:01:25.698 --> 01:01:28.668
Are zombies walking
up and down my alley

01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:30.370
and I need to be ready for them?

01:01:30.403 --> 01:01:33.506
I'm sure you've seen examples
of people where there is

01:01:33.539 --> 01:01:37.477
no separation and this is
something that's real to them.

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:38.945
Wrestling is real to them!

01:01:38.978 --> 01:01:40.346
What's up Zed Heads?

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.615
The zombie apocalypse is coming
whether you like it or not.

01:01:42.648 --> 01:01:45.351
It's not a matter of if, it's
a matter of when, and our homies

01:01:45.385 --> 01:01:47.320
at Zombie Industries are
going to help us prepare.

01:01:47.353 --> 01:01:49.355
They've got the bleeding targets
that you can use

01:01:49.389 --> 01:01:52.358
to armor yourself up
and protect your family.

01:01:52.392 --> 01:01:54.527
Here at Zombie Industries,
we're going to teach you firearm

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.797
safety, hand-to-hand combat,
and how to put a bullet

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:01.534
right through a zombie's brain
because it's your patriotic duty

01:02:01.567 --> 01:02:04.237
to prepare yourself
for the zombie hoards.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:07.707
It's the end of the world
and I feel fine.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.642
We're going to
train you up solid.

01:02:09.675 --> 01:02:11.310
Ladies, show them what you got!

01:02:11.344 --> 01:02:14.847
(yelling)

01:02:14.881 --> 01:02:17.150
We're coming for you, zombies!

01:02:22.622 --> 01:02:25.425
We understand that it's not
a matter of if the zombies come,

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:27.627
but more of a matter of when
and when they do,

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.061
we want people to be ready.

01:02:29.095 --> 01:02:31.831
We're all about preparedness
here and it really is

01:02:31.864 --> 01:02:34.534
something that we think
is a family activity.

01:02:34.567 --> 01:02:36.335
Everybody in the house
should be prepared

01:02:36.369 --> 01:02:37.570
for when the zombies come.

01:02:37.603 --> 01:02:40.173
We really want to instill
for our customers to actually

01:02:40.206 --> 01:02:43.042
have an avenue basically to
come out and give them products

01:02:43.075 --> 01:02:44.243
to train with.

01:02:44.277 --> 01:02:47.280
Our targets basically have
been shot in testing up to

01:02:47.313 --> 01:02:49.649
about 2500 times,
maybe a little bit more.

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:51.651
We've shot them with everything
from a .22 all the way up to

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:54.320
a 50 BMG, so anything
you want to throw at it.

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:57.723
All of our bleeding targets have
500 individual cells of blood

01:02:57.757 --> 01:03:00.526
inside distributed through the
center mass and through the face

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.462
so it's not one large bladder
where you shoot it once

01:03:02.495 --> 01:03:04.230
and everything runs out
and the fun's over.

01:03:04.263 --> 01:03:07.099
Our targets are designed
to last all day.

01:03:07.133 --> 01:03:09.535
Firearm safety is
a very serious thing.

01:03:09.569 --> 01:03:11.571
When you start talking about
shooting three-dimensional

01:03:11.604 --> 01:03:15.241
realistic human beings,
people get uneasy about that,

01:03:15.274 --> 01:03:17.877
but as soon as you make it
a zombie, then it's okay.

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:20.446
We came out with
the Chris zombie,

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.448
who is the quintessential
zombie.

01:03:22.482 --> 01:03:25.418
He still, to this day, remains
our number one seller.

01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:28.120
We did quickly move into
the terrorist and the Nazi.

01:03:28.154 --> 01:03:29.655
Zombies don't really
discriminate

01:03:29.689 --> 01:03:31.524
so we came out with
an ex-girlfriend.

01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:34.093
When people ask us all the
time, how do you have a female

01:03:34.126 --> 01:03:37.196
shooting target and I have to
tell them, look, if it comes

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.365
right down to it, if my
mother becomes a zombie,

01:03:39.398 --> 01:03:41.968
it's going to break my heart,
but I'm not going to hesitate.

01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:43.569
I'm going to have
to double tap her.

01:03:43.603 --> 01:03:47.073
When the zombie apocalypse
arrives, will you survive?

01:03:47.106 --> 01:03:49.175
Zombie go boom!

01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:52.545
Kick undead ass!

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:56.082
The USA-made Ka-Bar Zombie
Killer Swabbie was created

01:03:56.115 --> 01:04:00.319
to ensure you are prepared in
the most extreme of situations.

01:04:13.566 --> 01:04:14.967
Holy shit!

01:04:16.302 --> 01:04:17.837
Holy shit!

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.506
I didn't know if that was
actually a possibility

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:24.043
to take somebody's face off.

01:04:24.076 --> 01:04:28.180
The layers are ridiculous,
crystal skull, extremely hard.

01:04:28.214 --> 01:04:30.416
The crystal skull is actually
probably harder than

01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:32.451
a human skull and
this was just easy.

01:04:36.389 --> 01:04:37.456
How easy was that?

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:39.892
That was just as easy
as the first strike.

01:04:39.926 --> 01:04:41.394
ZGB approved!

01:04:41.427 --> 01:04:45.064
Oh my God!

01:04:45.097 --> 01:04:47.033
Calm down,
it's okay.

01:04:47.066 --> 01:04:48.200
I love that thing!

01:04:49.168 --> 01:04:51.304
A common phrase in
zombie circles is

01:04:51.337 --> 01:04:52.872
"blades don't need reloading."

01:04:52.905 --> 01:04:55.308
I always say, yeah but,
blades need sharpening.

01:04:55.341 --> 01:04:57.310
Have you ever tried to hit
someone with the back end

01:04:57.343 --> 01:04:58.578
of a machete?

01:04:58.611 --> 01:05:01.147
Like the parts that aren't sharp
or the flat end of a machete?

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.515
They'd be like, ah,
why'd you do that?

01:05:02.548 --> 01:05:03.683
You slapped me.

01:05:03.716 --> 01:05:05.985
Pack of dogs, I'd have a big
pack of dogs, big vicious

01:05:06.018 --> 01:05:09.221
and small vicious dogs
as long as there was dog food.

01:05:09.255 --> 01:05:11.657
I guess the zombies would
provide the dog food but then

01:05:11.691 --> 01:05:14.193
the dogs, you know how dogs like
to get into corpses and stuff

01:05:14.226 --> 01:05:15.461
and they throw up.

01:05:15.494 --> 01:05:17.597
I'd have to be letting the dog
out in the middle of the night

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:19.298
so they could vomit
and then the zombies

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.334
might get into the house.

01:05:21.367 --> 01:05:23.903
It's interesting because if it
did happen, people would think,

01:05:23.936 --> 01:05:26.672
okay, so it's like Romero
movies, but it might not be.

01:05:26.706 --> 01:05:28.641
It might not necessarily
be George's vision.

01:05:28.674 --> 01:05:29.909
It might be something else.

01:05:29.942 --> 01:05:32.878
You might cut their head off or
smash it in and the body still

01:05:32.912 --> 01:05:35.381
comes after you or something
like that, you know?

01:05:35.414 --> 01:05:37.249
(laughing)

01:05:37.283 --> 01:05:40.152
I think, you know,
movies show that there really

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:43.923
is no good weapon,
they always find a way.

01:05:43.956 --> 01:05:45.424
You're going to
run out of bullets.

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:50.863
There's too many to hold off
with a sword or a blunt object.

01:05:50.896 --> 01:05:52.398
Fire doesn't stop them.

01:05:52.431 --> 01:05:54.600
I mean, we're screwed.

01:05:54.634 --> 01:05:57.470
I have never seen a zombie
movie where someone dies of

01:05:57.503 --> 01:06:00.339
dehydration, but that's going
to kill a lot more people

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:01.874
than zombie bites.

01:06:01.907 --> 01:06:04.043
I've never seen a zombie movie
where someone has drunk from

01:06:04.076 --> 01:06:07.813
a puddle and crapped themselves
to death, but that's going to

01:06:07.847 --> 01:06:10.116
kill a lot more people
than zombie bites.

01:06:10.149 --> 01:06:14.353
Starvation, disease, friendly
fire, accidents, infections,

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:17.590
all these things are going
to kill people a lot faster.

01:06:17.623 --> 01:06:19.425
Liberals will
become your zombies.

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:22.328
They're going to be the first
ones to cry and moan and die

01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:25.297
and they're going to be the
first ones to do the looting,

01:06:25.331 --> 01:06:29.468
the pillaging, and they're
going to be the zombies.

01:06:29.502 --> 01:06:32.705
Like a lot of liberal Americans,
I was excited when Barack Obama

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:36.776
took office four years ago, but
it's a very different world now,

01:06:36.809 --> 01:06:39.211
and Mitt Romney is a very
different candidate, one with

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:42.381
the vision and determination to
cut through business as usual

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:46.285
politics, and finally put this
country back on the path

01:06:46.318 --> 01:06:47.953
to the zombie apocalypse.

01:06:47.987 --> 01:06:50.756
He's not afraid to face
a ravening grasping hoard of

01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:53.859
sub-humans because that's how
he sees poor people already.

01:06:53.893 --> 01:06:56.262
<i>Paid for by the Committee to
Learn Parkour, like really soon</i>,

01:06:56.295 --> 01:06:58.064
<i>like maybe take a class
or something</i>.

01:07:02.568 --> 01:07:04.203
We talked to a lot of
survivalists and preppers,

01:07:04.236 --> 01:07:06.505
each of them stressing
at the top of their list

01:07:06.539 --> 01:07:09.041
the most important thing
during any catastrophe --

01:07:09.075 --> 01:07:10.743
you know, like
a zombie apocalypse --

01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:15.548
the need for clean water and
water filters like this one.

01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:18.851
So in the name of survival,
I'm going to pee into this cup,

01:07:18.884 --> 01:07:23.422
filter it, and then drink it,
because if this filter works,

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.925
it's not really my
pee anymore, right?

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:27.526
You ready for this?

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.762
Okay, here it goes.

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:32.298
I'm thinking like I'm
at a doctor's office.

01:07:32.331 --> 01:07:36.202
Alright, here we go.

01:07:36.235 --> 01:07:38.704
Zombies are coming.

01:07:40.039 --> 01:07:42.074
It doesn't help
that it's fizzy.

01:07:44.343 --> 01:07:45.544
It's warm.

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:03.129
It kind of tastes
like water, yeah.

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:05.865
I think that was safe to drink.

01:08:05.898 --> 01:08:07.666
We're good.

01:08:08.901 --> 01:08:10.436
MATT I've tried to break down
every state in the United States

01:08:10.469 --> 01:08:13.739
based on zombie survivability
and I used 20 or 30 different

01:08:13.773 --> 01:08:18.109
factors -- topography, climate,
public health infrastructure,

01:08:18.144 --> 01:08:21.447
natural resources, military
presence, on and on and on,

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.116
the most important one is
population density, by far.

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:25.917
Up there also is
gun ownership rate.

01:08:25.951 --> 01:08:28.587
New Jersey ranks the lowest
in zombie survivability.

01:08:28.621 --> 01:08:32.024
Population density of 1,000
people per square mile

01:08:32.057 --> 01:08:34.693
and a gun ownership rate
of 12.3 percent.

01:08:34.727 --> 01:08:38.631
Then we look at Wyoming --
population density of 5.6 people

01:08:38.663 --> 01:08:42.201
per square mile and a gun
ownership rate of 68 percent,

01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:44.636
so it's like one dude with a gun
sitting on a farm going,

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:46.772
"Hey buddy, do you see
a zombie over there?"

01:08:46.805 --> 01:08:49.207
And the other guy yelling over,
"No, I don't see one!"

01:08:49.241 --> 01:08:53.145
Five people per square mile
makes very few zombies.

01:08:53.179 --> 01:08:54.779
The entire northeast
is totally screwed.

01:08:54.814 --> 01:08:56.948
If you ever want a reason
not to move to New York City,

01:08:56.982 --> 01:08:58.149
that's a reason.

01:08:58.184 --> 01:08:59.952
When zombies come,
everybody's dead.

01:08:59.984 --> 01:09:02.720
New York is the hero
city, it just is.

01:09:02.755 --> 01:09:05.256
Like I was in New York for 9/11,
I was there for the blackout,

01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:07.827
and look what happened with
this horrific storm?

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:10.629
New Yorkers freaking came
together, they kept calm,

01:09:10.662 --> 01:09:13.165
they carried on, and they're
dealing, so New York can handle

01:09:13.198 --> 01:09:15.734
anything and it's the most
densely populated place

01:09:15.768 --> 01:09:17.736
in North America.

01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:19.904
L.A., where I'm from, gone.

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:23.742
(laughter)

01:09:23.776 --> 01:09:25.477
I think one of the greatest
misconceptions in zombie

01:09:25.511 --> 01:09:28.413
survival is that zombies are
what you need to worry about

01:09:28.447 --> 01:09:29.682
when you're trying to survive.

01:09:29.715 --> 01:09:32.417
Zombies are only one of a whole
host of threats that you really

01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:36.121
need to face and I would argue
that humans are as great

01:09:36.154 --> 01:09:38.761
or maybe even a greater threat
than zombies, right?

01:09:39.763 --> 01:09:42.895
I'm not a horror fan.
I don't seek out fear.

01:09:42.928 --> 01:09:47.433
I think that most horror fans,
in their core, feel safe.

01:09:47.466 --> 01:09:51.069
I don't. I naturally feel scared
so my writing is to exercise

01:09:51.103 --> 01:09:53.104
an anxiety that I already have.

01:09:53.138 --> 01:09:57.309
I base my zombies on AIDS.

01:09:57.343 --> 01:10:01.213
Now AIDS is insanely
hard to get.

01:10:01.247 --> 01:10:04.016
It's not waterborne, it's not
foodborne, it's not airborne.

01:10:04.049 --> 01:10:06.986
How in the world did it kill
millions and millions of people

01:10:07.019 --> 01:10:09.054
and still killing millions
and millions of people?

01:10:09.088 --> 01:10:11.857
Because we, as people,
were stupid.

01:10:11.891 --> 01:10:13.759
If the President of the United
States had gone on national

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:17.496
television in say 1981 and said
look, there's a really, really

01:10:17.529 --> 01:10:20.633
horrible disease, hard to get,
but if you do get it, you're

01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:24.837
doomed, so there's going to be
a national education campaign,

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:27.573
we could have cured AIDS with
a pamphlet and so it's easy to

01:10:27.606 --> 01:10:31.510
imagine something like a zombie
plague getting out of control.

01:10:34.113 --> 01:10:36.749
MATT: Absolutely, a zombie
pandemic is possible.

01:10:36.782 --> 01:10:40.819
This new wave of zombies, this
living zombie, that is created

01:10:40.853 --> 01:10:45.624
by some sort of infection or
virus that gets out of hand.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.093
I really do think that
it's more plausible now

01:10:48.127 --> 01:10:50.396
than I did, say, five years ago.

01:10:50.429 --> 01:10:52.364
Could a zombie
apocalypse happen?

01:10:52.398 --> 01:10:55.467
Well, let's examine what we mean
or what the storytellers mean

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:56.702
when they say this.

01:10:56.735 --> 01:10:59.872
They mean a parasite jumping
from one organism to another.

01:10:59.905 --> 01:11:02.041
This happens routinely.

01:11:02.074 --> 01:11:05.010
60 percent of all human diseases
come from the animals

01:11:05.044 --> 01:11:06.779
that we eat or live with.

01:11:06.812 --> 01:11:09.782
AIDS has infected
75 billion people

01:11:09.815 --> 01:11:11.483
and killed 35 million people.

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:15.187
Bird flu and Swine flu,
the Bubonic Plague in Europe

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.990
killed half of the population
at the time.

01:11:18.023 --> 01:11:21.527
The Spanish Epidemic in 1918
killed more people

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.330
than the First World War.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:27.299
STEVEN: ANSD is the abbreviation
for the disease I made up,

01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:30.102
it stands for Ataxic
Neurodegenerative Satiety

01:11:30.135 --> 01:11:32.204
Deficiency Syndrome.

01:11:32.237 --> 01:11:34.073
Ataxic means you
don't walk well.

01:11:34.106 --> 01:11:37.142
Neurodegenerative means that
your brain is being degraded,

01:11:37.176 --> 01:11:38.410
it's degenerating.

01:11:38.444 --> 01:11:40.346
Satiety is a sense that you're
full, the sense that you've

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:41.680
eaten enough and that's
in your brain, too.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.515
Your brain is what tells you
you've eaten enough and it's

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:46.485
a syndrome because we don't
know what causes it.

01:11:46.518 --> 01:11:47.953
There is one thing
that we can't ever do,

01:11:47.987 --> 01:11:49.154
we can't raise the dead.

01:11:49.188 --> 01:11:51.223
In the book I wrote,
we philosophically decided

01:11:51.256 --> 01:11:53.325
that they were dead because
I realized medically speaking,

01:11:53.359 --> 01:11:55.928
I can't have anything that makes
the dead come back to life,

01:11:55.961 --> 01:12:00.065
but other than that aspect,
you can have brain pathology.

01:12:00.099 --> 01:12:03.202
You can have neurobiological
insults that will yield

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:06.805
a kind of presentation
of a person who acts like

01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:08.574
the zombies we see
in the movies.

01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:12.945
There are many splendid examples
of parasites that control

01:12:12.978 --> 01:12:16.815
behavior and often times, these
examples are as fantastical

01:12:16.849 --> 01:12:20.319
or even more fantastical than we
can see in Hollywood creations.

01:12:20.352 --> 01:12:23.689
So we have examples of fungi
controlling ant behavior.

01:12:23.722 --> 01:12:28.327
We have emerald jeweled wasps
injecting a very specific mind

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.096
manipulator into the brains
of cockroaches,

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:35.000
lots of examples of parasites
controlling behavior.

01:12:35.034 --> 01:12:37.736
We call them zombies and
we even think about it now

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:41.573
in the context of
zombie biology.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:44.143
In the case of the ants,
the case of the zombie ants,

01:12:44.176 --> 01:12:47.146
what happens is that a regular
colony of ants is living in

01:12:47.179 --> 01:12:49.915
a tropical rain forest and
in the course of foraging,

01:12:49.948 --> 01:12:53.085
they walk through a patch of
fungal spores in the ground

01:12:53.118 --> 01:12:56.755
and these fungal spores attach
tightly and start replicating

01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:01.894
inside its body...and then
at a particular moment when

01:13:01.927 --> 01:13:05.030
the fungus needs to complete
the rest of its life cycle,

01:13:05.064 --> 01:13:08.934
it controls the behavior of this
ant, making it leave the colony

01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:11.670
and go out into the
understory vegetation

01:13:11.703 --> 01:13:14.973
and go to the underside
of the leaf, deeply imbed

01:13:15.007 --> 01:13:18.744
those mandibles into the leaf,
because on the underside of

01:13:18.777 --> 01:13:22.314
this leaf, on the platform,
the fungus is going to grow

01:13:22.347 --> 01:13:25.918
a large stalk from the back of
the ant's head to produce spores

01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:28.153
which are shot down
into the forest floor

01:13:28.187 --> 01:13:31.857
and the cycle continues again.

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:33.659
Why doesn't it
happen for humans?

01:13:33.692 --> 01:13:36.495
It really comes down
to a numbers game.

01:13:36.528 --> 01:13:38.797
There are almost a million
species of insects

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:42.968
and there are roughly 5,500,
6,000 species of mammals.

01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:47.139
So evolution just hasn't had
the opportunity to play with our

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:50.442
minds, but despite that, we do
see some really cool examples

01:13:50.476 --> 01:13:52.811
in mammals of
controlled behavior.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:56.815
Rabies is something that really
springs to people's minds.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.617
MATT: When I was growing up,
no one ever talked about Mad Cow

01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:01.186
Disease, but Mad Cow Disease
is in the news a lot now.

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.921
Here's the problem with Mad
Cow Disease, it's created by

01:14:02.955 --> 01:14:06.091
a protein and it's called a
Prion, it's a mutated protein.

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:08.594
This protein, if it gets into
your brain, it causes all

01:14:08.627 --> 01:14:11.163
the other proteins in your
brain to mutate also.

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:14.967
The new strain of this protein
is showing evidence that

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.935
it can be transferred
from blood to blood.

01:14:16.969 --> 01:14:20.139
On top of that, the new symptoms
are it causes you to go insane

01:14:20.172 --> 01:14:22.841
and often violently insane.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.843
Mad Cow Disease turned
into Mad Human Disease

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.278
turned into Mad Zombie Disease.

01:14:26.311 --> 01:14:28.947
We already have Mad Cow,
we already have Mad Human,

01:14:28.981 --> 01:14:31.517
and we're halfway to Mad Zombie,
but the problem is

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:33.619
once it happens, it's too late.

01:14:33.652 --> 01:14:36.355
There's no more polite
discussion about what it's

01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:39.658
going to be like and debating
about the best way to survive.

01:14:39.691 --> 01:14:41.160
It's run and scream time.

01:14:41.193 --> 01:14:43.929
There's no more making movies,
there's no more watching TV,

01:14:43.962 --> 01:14:45.831
there's just, oh my God,
I'm being eaten.

01:14:45.864 --> 01:14:48.600
It appears the dead have risen
and are walking among us.

01:14:48.634 --> 01:14:50.435
These zombies have a certain
sexual preference

01:14:50.469 --> 01:14:51.970
by attacking only men.

01:14:52.004 --> 01:14:54.106
Officials at the Pentagon
are not sure if this is

01:14:54.139 --> 01:14:56.575
a biological attack or
if the zombies are simply

01:14:56.608 --> 01:14:57.976
doing this by choice.

01:15:06.952 --> 01:15:10.489
ALEX: In every town, in America
pretty much, or any town of any

01:15:10.522 --> 01:15:13.659
reasonable size, there's a group
of young people engaged,

01:15:13.692 --> 01:15:17.529
even as we speak, making their
independent zombie film.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:23.168
MAX: I don't know when
the zombie craze is going to

01:15:23.202 --> 01:15:25.737
die out, I don't think it'll
ever die out completely.

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:27.272
I think they're,
in some element,

01:15:27.306 --> 01:15:28.507
they're going to
be here to stay.

01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.142
I didn't expect it
to go on this long.

01:15:30.175 --> 01:15:32.711
I happen to write "The Zombie
Paper" and then later the book,

01:15:32.744 --> 01:15:36.782
just at the right time and then
it just keeps flying forward,

01:15:36.815 --> 01:15:39.718
or shambling forward, I should
say, this whole zombie thing.

01:15:39.751 --> 01:15:42.354
There's probably a ceiling on
zombie popularity, but I don't

01:15:42.387 --> 01:15:45.057
know if we've seen it yet and
I don't know when we will see it

01:15:45.090 --> 01:15:46.892
but as long as things
are fucked up.

01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:06.211
I've heard a number of people
say, this is it, zombies have

01:16:06.245 --> 01:16:08.847
run their course and now we're
going to see vampires again

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.116
or we're going to see werewolves
or we're going to see tapeworms.

01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:12.884
I don't know.

01:16:12.918 --> 01:16:16.755
DR. BLUMBERG: "World War Z," the
movie, is a perfect case study

01:16:16.788 --> 01:16:19.558
of not just how mainstream
zombies have become,

01:16:19.591 --> 01:16:22.761
but how much more mainstream
they might become.

01:16:22.794 --> 01:16:26.531
Because that film is a PG-13,
it is sort of a new frontier

01:16:26.565 --> 01:16:27.799
in a sense.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.735
KYLE: And that was scooped
just a little bit by

01:16:29.768 --> 01:16:32.137
the "Warm Bodies" film because
the "Warm Bodies" film

01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:35.007
was kind of the first
zombie date movie.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.410
Now we have a zombie movie you
can bring your girlfriend to.

01:16:38.443 --> 01:16:40.779
GREG: You know, to me, zombie
movies aren't zombie movies

01:16:40.812 --> 01:16:42.114
without gore.

01:16:42.147 --> 01:16:45.517
That's like doing a gangster
movie, but nobody has any guns.

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:50.155
Part of the whole culture of it
is the idea that you are being

01:16:50.188 --> 01:16:55.260
devoured literally
by another human being.

01:16:55.294 --> 01:16:58.630
FRAN: From "Night of the Living
Dead" to "World War Z,"

01:16:58.664 --> 01:17:01.333
we've covered a lot of ground
so it'll be interesting to see

01:17:01.366 --> 01:17:04.836
zombies in space or something.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.772
Not only do we have
PG-13 zombie movies,

01:17:06.805 --> 01:17:08.807
we have kid zombie movies now.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:17.316
Hollywood is banking on zombies
being that big, and to me,

01:17:17.349 --> 01:17:22.788
zombies have always been
small, little guys.

01:17:22.821 --> 01:17:26.291
THEA: I really believe that it's
something that connects us all

01:17:26.325 --> 01:17:28.660
and it's going to get bigger.

01:17:28.694 --> 01:17:30.495
ROBERT: They're gonna be on your
streets, they're gonna be in

01:17:30.529 --> 01:17:33.298
your stores, they're gonna be
coming at you, whether they're

01:17:33.332 --> 01:17:37.002
fast or slow or whatever the
hell they are, but it's here to

01:17:37.035 --> 01:17:40.572
stay, and you know what, if you
don't like it, get used to it

01:17:40.605 --> 01:17:43.175
