<i>Previously on the Secret Life
of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.457 --> 00:05.971
- I want to be married.
- You may never get that, Amy.

00:06.136 --> 00:07.405
- Do you like it?
- Yes, dad.

00:07.463 --> 00:10.534
I'm gonna wait. Give it to her the
night I graduate from high school.

00:10.684 --> 00:11.811
This is about Camille.

00:11.854 --> 00:13.739
When do you think it would be
too soon to give her a call?

00:13.949 --> 00:15.719
Tell her that you and Betty
have gone your separate ways,

00:15.753 --> 00:16.989
and... you just want to say hello.

00:17.023 --> 00:18.292
We've been together
since the third grade.

00:18.327 --> 00:21.668
Henry, you are not breaking
up with me at school, are you?

00:21.703 --> 00:24.743
I have to be at that graduation
ceremony in a cap and gown.

00:24.777 --> 00:26.681
I know someone who lives upstairs.

00:26.716 --> 00:27.751
Who's that?

00:27.785 --> 00:28.786
Some really rude,
obnoxious guy named Dante.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.959
You're Adrian, aren't you?

00:30.994 --> 00:32.864
Yeah. And you are?

00:32.898 --> 00:33.967
- Omar.
- His brother.

00:34.002 --> 00:36.841
I don't want to go to any
graduation stuff with you.

00:36.875 --> 00:39.882
I can't go through
 graduation solo.

00:39.916 --> 00:42.088
I will never make the
mistake of pushing you

00:42.123 --> 00:43.793
to do anything you don't wanna do.

00:43.827 --> 00:46.834
If you want have a relationship with
me, it's gotta be just you and me.

00:46.869 --> 00:47.803
- You're my best friend.
- So is Alice.

00:48.918 --> 00:52.950
- You and George make good roommates.
- You sure you don't mind if I stay here?

00:52.985 --> 00:54.120
You're up to something.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.092
She's trying to get
a proposal out of me.

00:56.126 --> 00:59.240
- And? 
- [Ricky] And I intend to enjoy that.

01:00.806 --> 01:02.910
No. I don't think that's
a good idea. Not at all.

01:02.944 --> 01:07.054
Dad, you have to let me go,
it's Jesse's graduation party.

01:07.089 --> 01:09.861
I don't have to let
you go, I really don't.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.802
<i>But it's his and his family's
party for him and his friends.</i>

01:12.837 --> 01:15.844
- And all my friends are going.
- Is your brother going?

01:15.878 --> 01:17.782
Ugh, he's not even
 going to graduation!

01:17.816 --> 01:21.826
- Oh. Right.
- [Lauren] Yeah, Mr. Smarty Pants thinks it's beneath him.

01:21.861 --> 01:25.135
Mr. Smarty Pants, huh?
Jason has to be at his school Friday

01:25.169 --> 01:27.141
to register for summer
school, he had no choice.

01:27.175 --> 01:29.595
Is Madison going?

01:30.082 --> 01:32.087
Her dad's gonna let her spend the
night at some house on the lake

01:32.121 --> 01:36.097
- fifty Miles from here?
- That depends on how this goes.

01:36.131 --> 01:38.805
And Amy's parents
 are letting her go.

01:38.839 --> 01:41.143
Well, I think she's already
moved out of the house.

01:41.179 --> 01:44.786
And I don't see Ricky
going to a party like this.

01:44.821 --> 01:47.995
I do. If he's not gonna marry
her, it's the least he can do.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.836
I'm not going to get into all that.

01:50.870 --> 01:54.913
Jesse's parents gave him permission
to use their summer house on the lake?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.855
They know he's throwing a party
and they're OK with that?

01:57.889 --> 02:00.699
Yes. They think it's a good,
safe place to have a party.

02:00.883 --> 02:05.809
- Drinking near a lake is safe.
- Who said anything about drinking?

02:05.843 --> 02:07.914
Don't be so naive, Lauren.
It's a graduation party

02:07.948 --> 02:10.922
with no parents around for 50 Miles,

02:10.955 --> 02:14.097
there's gonna be drinking and
probably other illegal activities,

02:14.131 --> 02:19.010
and so couples having sex.
I don't want you doing any of that.

02:19.044 --> 02:22.820
I'm not gonna do any of that stuff.
Dad, don't you trust me by now?

02:22.855 --> 02:24.926
I do, I do trust you, Lauren.

02:26.865 --> 02:31.175
I trust that you won't drink,
that you won't do anything illegal,

02:31.209 --> 02:34.952
and that you won't
have sex in high school.

02:34.986 --> 02:37.224
[Sighs] I won't. I promise.

02:39.097 --> 02:40.166
[Sighs]

02:42.138 --> 02:45.145
So you want to go to the party,
but you don't want to go with Jack?

02:45.180 --> 02:47.920
Well, I kind of want
 to go with Jack,

02:47.954 --> 02:52.164
but I told him that I'm not doing
any of the senior stuff with him.

02:52.199 --> 02:55.071
And why did you tell Jack you don't want
to do any of the senior stuff with him?

02:55.106 --> 02:57.044
Because I have too
 much self-esteem.

02:57.078 --> 02:59.951
I said I'd go as his friend,
but I really don't want to.

02:59.985 --> 03:01.957
'Cause he doesn't love
me, he loves grace.

03:01.991 --> 03:02.859
But if Jack finds out that
you're going to the party,

03:02.893 --> 03:05.132
and he asks you to go with him?

03:05.166 --> 03:07.003
I'm going with friends, I'm
not going with or for Jack.

03:07.038 --> 03:10.946
Really? Are you sure
you're not saying this

03:10.981 --> 03:12.183
just so I won't think that
you're sleeping with Jack?

03:12.217 --> 03:14.189
Not that I'm saying
 that you can go.

03:14.223 --> 03:17.163
Dad, everyone is going.
Please, just let me go, please!

03:17.197 --> 03:20.071
I just don't like the idea of a bunch
of seniors out partying all night.

03:20.105 --> 03:22.177
I'm sure there'll be
 booze, and worse.

03:22.211 --> 03:24.082
Well, there won't be
any drinking and driving

03:24.116 --> 03:25.784
because everyone's spending
the night at the house.

03:25.819 --> 03:29.128
- So, there will be drinking?
- [Madison] I'm not going to drink or do anything worse.

03:29.162 --> 03:32.103
<i>I'd just feel better about it if
the lake house was a little closer.</i>

03:32.137 --> 03:33.907
If it was somewhere I
could come and pick you up

03:33.942 --> 03:36.247
if something doesn't go the way you
expect it to and you want to come home.

03:36.281 --> 03:38.920
Jack can bring me home
if I want to come home.

03:38.955 --> 03:41.327
<i>You know, we're still good enough
friends. He'd do that I'm sure.</i>

03:41.361 --> 03:45.137
Well, he won't be able to do that
if he's been drinking, will he?

03:45.171 --> 03:47.978
Well, then, I can 
drive myself home.

03:48.012 --> 03:49.081
From some place 50 Miles away from
here in the middle of the night

03:49.115 --> 03:52.991
- that you've never been to before?
- Dad, I'm not gonna have to drive myself home.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.261
Just let me go, please.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.680
<i>[Sighs]</i>

03:57.780 --> 04:01.112
We can get a babysitter. I'm sure my dad
would be happy to take John for the night.

04:01.146 --> 04:04.120
no, I don't want to get a babysitter
to go somewhere I don't want to go.

04:04.154 --> 04:07.061
I don't even like getting babysitters
to go somewhere we do want to go.

04:09.167 --> 04:10.269
I wanna go.

04:15.986 --> 04:18.257
Madison and Lauren are going
and a lot of other people.

04:18.291 --> 04:22.301
It would be fun to do something less
adult and more high school, for a change.

04:22.336 --> 04:25.141
Yeah, I don't really
want to drive 50 Miles

04:25.177 --> 04:29.219
to be with a bunch of kids drinking and
doing other stupid stuff and having sex.

04:29.254 --> 04:32.160
I'd like to do something
less high school, more adult.

04:32.195 --> 04:35.335
But it's going to be your
last night of high school.

04:35.370 --> 04:39.078
Yeah. High school. Just
graduation from high school.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.418
- It's not that big a deal.
- It's a very big deal.

04:41.452 --> 04:45.261
Twelve years of school you've finished?
Hello, that's quite an accomplishment.

04:45.296 --> 04:47.301
If you feel that way
about it, then you party

04:47.335 --> 04:51.177
at some lake house on your graduation
night, but I don't want to, Amy.

04:51.211 --> 04:57.126
I want it to be just you and me. Here.
Right here. You and me and our son.

04:57.461 --> 05:01.170
<i>Aw, come on,</i>

05:01.204 --> 05:04.011
it's you and me and
 John all the time.

05:04.045 --> 05:06.149
We should make it
special, graduation night.

05:06.185 --> 05:07.186
Really special.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.327
And out in the outdoors like that,

05:10.362 --> 05:13.202
who knows what kind of
crazy things could happen.

05:13.236 --> 05:15.273
Not me. And I don't want to know.

05:15.308 --> 05:19.318
And I promise, graduation will be
special with just the two of us.

05:19.352 --> 05:22.359
I promise.  Promise.

05:23.195 --> 05:25.134
<i>[Sighs]</i>

05:25.168 --> 05:27.105
No. It doesn't matter what you
do. You can't talk me into it.

05:27.140 --> 05:33.155
So, don't even try, all right?
You've done enough for me lately.

05:33.157 --> 05:37.031
- But you won't do this one little thing for me?
- [Ricky] No.

- What are you thinking?
- I don't know, what am I thinking?

05:59.909 --> 06:03.814
You're gonna go after Dante's
brother, Adrian? His Brother, Adrian?!

06:03.848 --> 06:05.681
It's bad enough you
don't see to have any boundaries,

06:05.850 --> 06:09.622
when it comes to going after friend's boyfriend
or your boyfriend's friend or whatever Ben was,

06:09.656 --> 06:13.594
but this is Dante's older brother.
It's his brother, Adrian!

06:13.629 --> 06:15.864
Dante should have called me.

06:15.899 --> 06:16.732
He's backpacking across
Europe with his buddies.

06:16.766 --> 06:18.935
He should have told me he was going.

06:18.969 --> 06:20.971
You just met Dante!
To tell you everything.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.856
Well, I don't have to
him everything either.

06:22.891 --> 06:26.579
- Don't forget, I'm still married.
- OK, I thought you liked Dante.

06:26.613 --> 06:29.684
Do not go out with his
brother, if you like Dante.

06:29.719 --> 06:31.954
He's going to Europe
back, hen when he gets

06:31.988 --> 06:33.823
maybe your divorce 
papers will be filed,

06:33.857 --> 06:35.625
and you'll be free
go Out with him for real. 

06:35.660 --> 06:39.965
I'm free now. He just isn't around.
And I'm not gonna wait around for him.

06:39.999 --> 06:43.738
Look, I really like his brother.
I really like Omar.

06:45.808 --> 06:47.709
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:47.744 --> 06:51.014
- What's going on?
- Well, we got invited to a party.

06:51.049 --> 06:53.618
- "We", who?
- We. You and me.

06:53.652 --> 06:56.722
I guess Lauren's boyfriend
thinks we're all friends,

06:56.757 --> 06:58.625
and I think he's even
inviting you, too, grace.

06:58.659 --> 07:00.453
You and whoever you want
 to bring. To his family's

07:00.454 --> 07:02.760
summer house, at the
lake, graduation night.

07:02.799 --> 07:06.570
And, um, whoever I'd like to bring?

07:06.605 --> 07:09.608
You... you're bringing
your'e not even divorced yet.

07:09.642 --> 07:10.909
I know. I was just asking.

07:10.943 --> 07:12.979
Hmm. Whatever Adrian,

07:13.013 --> 07:17.652
I'd love to see you intrest
other than Ricky. [Scoffs]

07:17.686 --> 07:18.621
I can still drive you
up there, if you want.

07:18.655 --> 07:21.658
Um, that's OK.

07:21.692 --> 07:25.764
I think I'll just and her new friends,
if her new friends are going.

07:25.799 --> 07:27.734
You know, it might be worth
if we went togther,

07:27.768 --> 07:29.636
you might meet someone
up there or something.

07:29.670 --> 07:30.704
- I might.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:34.912 --> 07:39.751
I hope that stupid consuler don't get up on stage
with evreyone else, if she doesn't, then... [Sighs]

07:39.785 --> 07:44.858
Graduation could be depressing.
You know, maybe we can go to the lake a little sonner,

07:44.892 --> 07:50.032
- have our own party. Know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know but it's not our house.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.035
And I don't even know if Jannie
 gonna want to go.

07:52.069 --> 07:53.904
Are you having a trouble with Daniel?

07:53.939 --> 07:56.675
no. Not really. It's just...

07:56.709 --> 07:58.945
He's a little bit more mutre
then my high-school's friends.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.648
you know, I don't know
if he wants to go, he is in collage.

08:01.683 --> 08:06.589
Hmm, if he thought you'll have sex with him,
at the lake, he'd go.

08:06.623 --> 08:07.924
I don't think he will want to
use Jassie's parents' lake house

08:07.959 --> 08:12.731
- for those purposes his own apartment.
- I'm gonna go see the counselor.

08:21.812 --> 08:24.815
What's going on? You
hear about Jesse's party?

08:25.718 --> 08:26.818
Yeah, I heard.

08:26.852 --> 08:28.654
But I'm not a senior
and I'm not graduating,

08:28.688 --> 08:31.892
and my boyfriend's in college, so...

08:31.926 --> 08:34.828
- So are you going?
- I don't know.

08:34.863 --> 08:36.899
Well, you should go,
whether Daniel goes or not,

08:36.933 --> 08:38.868
you should go. It's
all your old friends.

08:38.903 --> 08:41.839
- Last chance to be with our senior class.
- I don't think I want to go.

08:41.874 --> 08:43.808
You're making too
 big a deal out of it.

08:43.842 --> 08:46.813
It's one night with a
bunch of old friends.

08:47.682 --> 08:49.717
OK, I'll think about it.

08:54.792 --> 08:55.960
But graduation is the
last day of school.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.730
We always spend the last
day of school together.

08:58.765 --> 08:59.831
You, me and Henry.

08:59.866 --> 09:02.870
Yeah. Um, I guess we
won't do that this year,

09:02.904 --> 09:04.905
unless of course, you and
Henry decide you want to,

09:04.940 --> 09:06.808
and then the three of
us can go to the party.

09:06.842 --> 09:09.679
The three of us? Ben,
there is no three of us.

09:09.713 --> 09:11.548
We're gonna be taking turns with you.

'Re sharing custody.
Didn't Henry tell you?

09:12.851 --> 09:14.787
Uh, no.

09:14.821 --> 09:18.758
Yeah. So... I thought we'd
hang out at your house,

09:18.793 --> 09:20.728
we've always hung out at your
house the last day of school.

09:20.762 --> 09:22.731
Henry said he wanted
to go to this party.

09:22.765 --> 09:24.359
It's up at Jesse's parents'
lake house, it's the same night.

09:24.394 --> 09:24.901
Well, that's not our agreement.

09:24.935 --> 09:28.472
- I'll talk to Henry.
- Good.

<i>Don't run away. You don't
have to be afraid of me.</i>

09:46.799 --> 09:50.604
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Well, she has someone in there.

09:50.638 --> 09:52.607
I'm just waiting around to
see if I can go up on stage

09:52.641 --> 09:56.813
with the rest of you at graduation.
I won't get a diploma yet,

09:56.848 --> 09:58.695
but it would be nice
if I could at least feel

09:58.717 --> 10:01.720
as if I'm still part
of the class, you know?

10:01.755 --> 10:04.791
I still can't believe this
last year, lousy year for me.

10:07.796 --> 10:09.865
What's going on?

10:09.899 --> 10:11.901
I don't know. Counselor asked
me to stop by, I'm stopping by.

10:12.431 --> 10:17.134
No, something else is going on.
You and Amy are OK, right?

10:17.778 --> 10:18.944
<i>[Chuckles] Yeah.</i>

10:18.979 --> 10:20.914
Are you and Amy going to
that party, after graduation?

10:20.948 --> 10:25.744
- No.
- Oh, that's too bad. I think I'm going. It'll be fun.

10:25.779 --> 10:27.824
You know, all of us
together one last time.

10:27.858 --> 10:30.728
And I will be bringing someone with me,

10:30.762 --> 10:33.065
so it's not like I will be trying
to put the moves on you, all right?

10:33.099 --> 10:36.837
No one said you were. We just
have other things to do that night.

10:36.871 --> 10:38.840
All right, well, I'm not gonna
make a big deal out of it.

10:38.874 --> 10:41.710
I'll be seeing you
in the fall, you know.

10:41.745 --> 10:43.747
Don't go to the same
school as me, Adrian,

10:43.781 --> 10:44.848
there are plenty of other schools.

10:44.882 --> 10:47.719
Don't cause any more
trouble for me or for Amy.

10:47.754 --> 10:49.688
Start your life somewhere
else, why don't you?

10:49.722 --> 10:51.308
I'll start my life
 wherever I want.

10:54.029 --> 10:57.667
I love you, I've 
always loved you,

10:57.701 --> 11:00.771
and one day I will
make love to you again.

11:00.805 --> 11:02.574
I don't care what
happens with you and Amy,

11:02.608 --> 11:04.610
mark my words, it will happen.

11:04.644 --> 11:08.916
Maybe not before we close out our
senior years here, but it will happen.

11:12.822 --> 11:15.559
Oh. Hi, Adrian. I 
wasn't expecting you.

11:15.594 --> 11:16.694
I was expecting you, come on in.

11:19.765 --> 11:21.634
I do have some good
news for you, though.

11:21.668 --> 11:23.670
You may attend graduation
in cap and gown,

11:23.705 --> 11:25.840
and we'll even present you with
a diploma that's dated August,

11:25.875 --> 11:27.843
but not yet signed,
but I know it will be.

11:27.878 --> 11:29.846
Yes! Thank you so much!

11:29.881 --> 11:32.717
This means so much to me! Oh,
you're the best, Ms. McGillecuty.

11:33.752 --> 11:38.926
- Thank you!
- McGillecuty?

11:41.664 --> 11:44.700
So, you have one more
week until graduation,

11:44.735 --> 11:48.973
and that leaves you with one
more week to write a speech.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.877
To write a speech? I thought my
classes were pretty much over.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.714
They are. You ended up
with the highest scores,

11:54.749 --> 11:57.920
the highest average 
by just this much.

11:57.954 --> 12:00.690
Oh. Yeah, OK. Well,
I guess that's good.

12:00.724 --> 12:04.896
- What speech?
- At graduation? You're valedictorian.

12:05.932 --> 12:09.770
- No. No, thanks. I decline.
- You can't. -[Ricky] I just did.

12:09.804 --> 12:12.774
No, really, this is big!
I mean, this is something

12:12.808 --> 12:14.910
that you're gonna remember
for the rest of your life.

12:14.945 --> 12:16.780
This is something that your
mothers are gonna remember,

12:16.814 --> 12:19.917
- and your dad, and Amy and...
- No. - You have to.

12:19.952 --> 12:23.623
No, I don't. I 
respectfully decline.

12:23.657 --> 12:25.826
- I don't want the honor.
- Don't make me talk to Amy.

12:25.860 --> 12:26.827
<i>[Sighs]</i>

12:26.861 --> 12:30.633
OK, sorry about that.
But you should do this.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.672
I don't do shoulds. I should
have worn a condom, for example.

12:34.707 --> 12:36.775
Are you thinking you
 don't deserve this?

12:36.810 --> 12:41.214
Ricky, you deserve this.
After all that you've endured,

12:41.249 --> 12:44.886
after how hard you've worked to
overcome your personal circumstances,

12:44.921 --> 12:47.657
<i>after achieving the
highest academic record</i>

12:47.691 --> 12:50.996
at a top-rated high
school, you deserve this.

12:54.001 --> 12:58.806
I can't. I really can't. Even
if I wanted to do it, I can't.

12:58.841 --> 12:59.907
You can do anything.

13:02.376 --> 13:02.376
+

13:06.012 --> 13:08.348
Hey there. How was lunch?

13:08.362 --> 13:11.265
Eh, it was lunch. Any phone calls?

13:11.299 --> 13:13.335
Let me see, let me see...

13:13.369 --> 13:15.270
Oh, yeah. Just the one.

13:15.304 --> 13:17.173
Just someone named...

13:17.207 --> 13:20.243
Huh, I can hardly read my writing here.

13:20.278 --> 13:22.313
Oh, yeah, Camille?

13:23.382 --> 13:25.384
Oh, any message?

13:25.418 --> 13:30.323
Yeah, she says she'd like to have an
after work drink with you, if you have

13:30.358 --> 13:34.129
do you have time? She said I could
just, uh, call her and let her know.

13:34.163 --> 13:36.164
I guess I could do that.

13:36.199 --> 13:37.433
6:00? OK, or whatever
time she can get there.

13:37.468 --> 13:40.170
The usual?

13:40.205 --> 13:41.472
Yeah, don't want to make
it too important, you know.

13:41.506 --> 13:44.442
Yeah, I know.

13:44.477 --> 13:47.413
Oh, I hope she doesn't
want the job back.

13:47.447 --> 13:50.250
I would never give her the
job back, the job is all yours.

13:50.284 --> 13:53.388
You have been doing a really good
job so far, so, just keep it up.

13:54.456 --> 13:54.857
[Laughs]

13:54.891 --> 13:58.361
[Phone ringing]

13:58.396 --> 14:00.230
Boykewich International.
How may I help you?

14:01.299 --> 14:02.433
What's wrong, Betty?

14:03.502 --> 14:06.271
Are you crying?

14:07.307 --> 14:11.145
I'm, I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

14:21.559 --> 14:22.393
Hi, there.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.495
Oh. Hi.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.299
Finding it a little scary to leave?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.502
No, I'll be back tomorrow,
we still have a week left.

14:29.537 --> 14:31.505
I meant, leave high school.

14:31.540 --> 14:34.409
No, you know, I'm kind of
looking forward to a fresh start.

14:34.444 --> 14:35.343
It's time for me to leave here.

14:35.378 --> 14:37.513
Too many bad memories here.

14:37.548 --> 14:42.186
Bad memories? Jack, you're
captain of the football team,

14:42.220 --> 14:44.155
you can play any sport you want to,

14:44.190 --> 14:47.259
you have got offers for scholarships
to both colleges you want to go to,

14:47.294 --> 14:49.229
you've done really well here.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.333
And you're popular. And on
top of that, you're a nice guy.

14:52.367 --> 14:55.571
Yeah, but I can't have the
one thing I really want. Grace.

14:55.605 --> 14:58.374
Grace bowman?

14:58.409 --> 15:02.313
Yeah, we dated her first year
here and then on and off, and...

15:02.347 --> 15:05.383
I love her, I've always loved her.

15:05.418 --> 15:10.324
Aw, that's... wait, I, I
thought you and Madison...

15:10.358 --> 15:12.392
She's a nice girl, but grace is the one.

15:12.427 --> 15:15.498
Oh, well, you never know
what'll happen in life.

15:15.532 --> 15:17.466
Maybe you'll go your
separate ways for now,

15:17.501 --> 15:20.237
and maybe you'll come
back to each other,

15:20.271 --> 15:24.208
or maybe there's some lucky girl out
there that's waiting for a guy like

15:24.243 --> 15:26.478
you're going to
college, that's exciting.

15:26.513 --> 15:29.382
It's gonna be fun, you're
gonna do well. Focus on that.

15:30.317 --> 15:34.156
And focus on this:

15:34.190 --> 15:37.160
Um, we would like you to say the
prayer at graduation ceremonies.

15:37.194 --> 15:38.261
Oh, really?

15:38.295 --> 15:41.431
Maybe grace could help you
with writing the prayer.

15:41.466 --> 15:44.202
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, I'll do
it. I'll, I'll definitely do it.

15:44.537 --> 15:45.404
Good.

15:45.438 --> 15:46.238
Yeah.

15:47.541 --> 15:50.243
So have you and Alice been talking?

15:50.278 --> 15:51.312
Any kind of agreement
between the two of you?

15:52.548 --> 15:53.548
What?

15:53.582 --> 15:55.217
A custody agreement.

15:55.251 --> 15:56.451
That's, that's ridiculous.

15:56.486 --> 15:59.289
You're not a child, and
you're certainly not our child,

15:59.323 --> 15:59.622
you're our friend.

15:59.657 --> 16:01.392
Do you?

16:01.426 --> 16:02.526
Yes.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.196
Henry! Oh, for God's sake, man,

16:04.230 --> 16:06.164
I can't be swapped back and forth

16:06.199 --> 16:10.204
between the two of you for the rest
of our lives like I'm some child

16:10.238 --> 16:11.138
being fought over in a divorce.

16:11.172 --> 16:13.174
It's not like that.

16:13.209 --> 16:14.542
What's it like?

16:14.577 --> 16:16.378
She gets you Thanksgiving day,
I get you Thanksgiving night.

16:16.413 --> 16:18.348
She gets Christmas and I get new year's,

16:18.382 --> 16:20.217
it's every other Monday holiday,

16:20.251 --> 16:22.153
I get you easter, she
gets fourth of July.

16:22.187 --> 16:24.456
We're not fighting at all.

16:24.490 --> 16:27.125
We have a very sound agreement
that we're both happy with.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.128
What about graduation?

16:29.163 --> 16:30.397
Because she wants to come over to
my house the last day of school,

16:30.432 --> 16:33.133
and graduation's that night, and...

16:33.169 --> 16:36.239
And by the way, I am a grown
man, and this is ridiculous!

16:36.273 --> 16:38.140
You two have put me right in the middle.

16:38.175 --> 16:40.177
So if you want to go to the
party at the lake house with me,

16:40.211 --> 16:41.478
then tell Alice that's
the way it's gonna be.

16:41.512 --> 16:44.315
Don't put me in the position
of telling her, OK?

16:44.350 --> 16:48.188
Hey, all right, forget it.
Just, just let Alice go with you.

16:48.222 --> 16:50.457
I'm the one who caused all
this pain, so let her go.

16:50.491 --> 16:52.326
I don't want to go with Alice,

16:52.361 --> 16:55.264
I want to go and have a good
time and not worry about Alice.

16:55.298 --> 16:57.567
If Alice goes then I'll
have to take care of her,

16:57.601 --> 17:00.237
look out for her, make sure
she's having a good time...

17:00.272 --> 17:02.172
And you wouldn't do that for me?

17:02.207 --> 17:03.308
Would I need to do that for you?

17:03.342 --> 17:06.244
I'm going through a
break-up, man, I'm lost.

17:07.446 --> 17:10.450
I'm going through a
divorce. We're both lost.

17:10.484 --> 17:12.487
But you can't just lean on me,

17:12.521 --> 17:14.321
we're gonna have to lean on each other.

17:16.226 --> 17:18.328
Just face it, Alice is
stronger than both of us.

17:18.362 --> 17:21.265
Maybe she was, but I don't know anymore.

17:23.234 --> 17:25.304
Wait. Like I stole her chi?

17:25.338 --> 17:26.538
Did she tell you I stole her chi?

17:26.571 --> 17:28.207
Because I didn't steal her chi.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.178
Life energy?

17:32.247 --> 17:33.047
Oh.

17:38.522 --> 17:40.223
What's up?

17:40.258 --> 17:42.293
I don't know, I just got here.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.261
You got a look on your face.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.364
No, I don't. Yeah, you do.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.533
All right, I do.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.536
But you don't like to get involved

17:49.570 --> 17:51.272
with people and their
personal problems, so, don't.

17:53.575 --> 17:56.278
You're asking her to
marry you, aren't you?

17:56.312 --> 17:58.247
What? That's it, isn't it?

17:58.282 --> 17:59.382
OK, just tell me that that's
it and I'll stay out of it,

17:59.416 --> 18:02.486
but I won't be able to
keep the smile off my face

18:02.520 --> 18:04.255
until I see the ring on her finger.

18:04.290 --> 18:06.392
No. That's not it. That's not it at all.

18:07.361 --> 18:09.296
I'm valedictorian.

18:09.330 --> 18:10.330
You are?

18:10.365 --> 18:12.367
Yeah, I am.

18:12.401 --> 18:14.369
And now I've got to give this
stupid speech at graduation,

18:14.403 --> 18:16.372
and I don't want to. But I got to. So...

18:16.406 --> 18:20.510
So that's good, too. Congratulations.

18:21.380 --> 18:26.418
And you're asking Amy to marry you?

18:26.452 --> 18:29.355
All right, all right, I don't
know how you figured that out,

18:29.390 --> 18:32.526
but yes. But only if it all works
out and the timing is right, and...

18:32.560 --> 18:34.496
Mmm. Congratulations.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.166
You're the first person I've told.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.569
But you're a very important
person to me, bunny.

18:39.604 --> 18:43.174
You've made a big difference in
my life. You've taught me a lot.

18:43.208 --> 18:44.475
I know.

18:47.742 --> 18:53.354
[Humming]

19:00.266 --> 19:01.530
[Knocking on door]

19:01.986 --> 19:04.254
She's not home yet.

19:04.288 --> 19:06.322
Good. I wanted to get
here before she gets here.

19:06.357 --> 19:09.292
I'm happy you're here
before she gets here.

19:09.326 --> 19:10.995
We're talking about your mother, right?

19:11.029 --> 19:13.030
Right. Is everything going OK?

19:13.064 --> 19:14.131
Oh, everything is going very OK.

19:14.165 --> 19:17.101
Is Anne OK with her staying here?

19:17.135 --> 19:19.003
Oh, Anne is more than
OK with her staying here.

19:19.037 --> 19:21.272
What does that mean?

19:21.306 --> 19:22.973
That means that I think
someone has a crush on someone,

19:23.008 --> 19:24.041
know what I mean?

19:24.075 --> 19:26.043
I have no idea what you mean.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.011
I saw Anne looking at your mother

19:27.045 --> 19:29.147
and I saw your mother
looking back at her.

19:29.181 --> 19:30.348
Huh?

19:30.383 --> 19:32.150
Oh, yeah. There's a
romance brewing all right.

19:32.184 --> 19:33.351
I saw it with my own eyes.

19:33.386 --> 19:35.287
Between Amy's mother and my mother?

19:35.321 --> 19:37.155
No, no that would not be good.

19:37.189 --> 19:39.090
Are you kidding? That would be great.

19:39.125 --> 19:40.225
That'd mean the whole
time I was cheating,

19:40.259 --> 19:42.160
I had a reason to cheat
because my ex-wife is gay.

19:42.194 --> 19:44.062
[Scoffs]

19:44.096 --> 19:45.231
That would mean that nothing was
my fault, it was all her fault.

19:45.265 --> 19:47.133
If those two hit it
off, I hit the jackpot,

19:47.167 --> 19:49.235
all guilt is resolved and I am king!

19:49.269 --> 19:51.304
Anne is not gay, OK? She had
a boyfriend, that architect,

19:51.338 --> 19:54.240
and then there was her old
high school boyfriend, and...

19:54.274 --> 19:56.142
And none of those
relationships worked out either.

19:56.176 --> 19:58.044
That doesn't mean she's gay.

19:58.078 --> 20:00.379
Well, not in and of itself, but,
I sense a strong possibility,

20:00.414 --> 20:02.282
very strong possibility.

20:02.317 --> 20:04.284
No. I think my mom would
have said something to me.

20:04.319 --> 20:06.153
Well, wait around until she gets home,

20:06.187 --> 20:07.154
and maybe you can get
her to say something.

20:07.188 --> 20:09.089
That's not what I came by for.

20:09.123 --> 20:10.190
What'd you come by for?

20:12.393 --> 20:15.295
Oh, hi, honeys, I'm home.

20:15.330 --> 20:17.130
Hi. Hi.

20:17.165 --> 20:18.265
What's for dinner? [Gasps]

20:18.299 --> 20:20.101
Are you and Amy eating with us?

20:20.135 --> 20:21.402
No, no, we're eating at home.

20:21.437 --> 20:24.272
Speaking of which, I better go.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.173
Yeah, I better go. Goodnight.

20:29.111 --> 20:32.213
What was that all about?

20:32.247 --> 20:34.382
I don't know. He came over
here to see me about something,

20:34.416 --> 20:36.084
but never got around to telling me what.

20:36.118 --> 20:38.153
Oh, no. [Scoffs]

20:38.188 --> 20:41.323
You didn't say anything about
your stupid theory, did you?

20:41.358 --> 20:43.225
I couldn't help myself.

20:43.259 --> 20:46.462
[Sighs] OK, now he's
gonna say something to Amy,

20:46.496 --> 20:48.364
and Amy's gonna say something to Anne,

20:48.398 --> 20:51.200
and Anne is gonna drive over here,
and kick me out of this place,

20:51.234 --> 20:53.068
and then I'm gonna have no place to go.

20:53.103 --> 20:54.204
There's no reason the three
of us can't live here together.

20:55.439 --> 20:57.140
Snap out of it!

21:00.077 --> 21:01.677
Ricky?

21:05.316 --> 21:08.218
Huh, daddy isn't here.

21:08.252 --> 21:10.053
I wonder where daddy is.

21:10.087 --> 21:11.155
[Cell phone ringing]

21:18.029 --> 21:19.263
Hello?

21:19.297 --> 21:21.365
That idiot invited Adrian to the party!

21:21.400 --> 21:24.168
He's not an idiot, he just didn't know.

21:24.202 --> 21:29.307
Oh. Well, I don't think I
can talk Ricky into it anyway.

21:29.342 --> 21:34.179
No, Amy, we have to go. We shouldn't
let Adrian ruin this for us.

21:34.213 --> 21:36.148
<i>But the three of us are kind
of seeing this as our party,</i>

21:36.182 --> 21:38.183
<i>and it's not our party.</i>

21:38.217 --> 21:39.751
Uh, yes, it is! It's our last chance

21:39.786 --> 21:43.321
to be with these seniors at a party
and you have to talk Ricky into coming!

21:43.356 --> 21:45.324
I mean you got him that
special ice cream thing,

21:45.359 --> 21:48.060
<i>whatever it was and,
and you washed his hair.</i>

21:48.095 --> 21:50.196
I mean, I don't think
he'd marry you for that,

21:50.230 --> 21:52.231
but he should at least come to
one stupid party for you for that.

21:52.266 --> 21:55.401
He doesn't have to go to the stupid
party if he doesn't want to go.

21:55.436 --> 21:57.370
Well, you want to go.

21:57.404 --> 22:00.139
I don't know if I do, Madison,
not if Adrian's gonna be there.

22:00.174 --> 22:02.309
[Sighs] We can't let
Adrian ruin this for us.

22:02.343 --> 22:06.213
OK, well, um, look,

22:06.247 --> 22:08.315
I want to get John ready for
bed before Ricky gets home.

22:08.349 --> 22:10.083
I have to run, bye.

22:12.987 --> 22:15.022
She shouldn't let Adrian
keep her from going.

22:15.056 --> 22:16.323
Why did he invite
her? [Exclaims angrily]

22:16.357 --> 22:18.325
Jesse was just being nice.

22:18.359 --> 22:21.329
You know, he wanted me to feel comfortable,
and have some of my friends there.

22:21.363 --> 22:24.299
Well, I already told my
dad that your dad said yes.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.335
He'll say yes. He's
already leaning towards yes.

22:27.369 --> 22:31.973
I made it an issue of trust.
My family's really big on trust.

22:32.007 --> 22:33.274
So, I'm going to that party.

22:33.309 --> 22:35.343
But you don't sound
very excited about it.

22:35.377 --> 22:40.049
Yeah, I don't know. I thought about it,

22:40.083 --> 22:43.118
and I just wish Jesse asked
me about the whole thing first.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.087
I don't really want
to go to a big party,

22:45.121 --> 22:47.122
I'd rather just be with him.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.158
Big parties are just
trouble waiting to happen.

22:49.192 --> 22:52.027
And if anyone does anything
stupid at this party,

22:52.062 --> 22:54.097
then somehow I'm gonna get in trouble.

22:54.131 --> 22:56.166
Um, hello. If anyone gets in trouble,

22:56.200 --> 22:58.201
it's gonna be Jesse, it's his party.

22:58.236 --> 23:00.337
Yeah. He doesn't seem
too worried about it,

23:00.371 --> 23:04.140
so, I guess it'll be OK.

23:04.175 --> 23:08.078
You guess it'll be OK? Just OK?

23:08.112 --> 23:11.949
No, it's gonna be great. I
really want to go to a party.

23:11.984 --> 23:13.251
I have never been to a party.

23:13.285 --> 23:17.021
Not a real, like,
unchaperoned, no parents,

23:17.055 --> 23:19.056
fifty Miles away from
civilization kind of party.

23:19.091 --> 23:22.293
Yeah, I know. Neither have I.

23:22.327 --> 23:25.263
But I don't know why, I'm just
not getting a good feeling about it

23:25.297 --> 23:27.365
now that I've made
it so important to go.

23:27.399 --> 23:30.168
Well, you're just
nervous, it's gonna be fun.

23:30.203 --> 23:32.137
I hope so.

23:32.171 --> 23:35.340
[Groans] And I hope Jesse doesn't
have any plans to try anything again.

23:35.375 --> 23:39.978
He promised he wouldn't,

23:40.013 --> 23:42.381
but he won't, will he?

23:42.415 --> 23:44.149
I think you've made your feelings

23:44.183 --> 23:46.183
about not wanting to
have sex pretty clear.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.031
I picked up dinner. Sorry,
I should've left you a note.

23:58.065 --> 24:02.001
No. Here you go, buddy.

24:02.036 --> 24:04.138
That's OK, that's so nice of you.

24:05.974 --> 24:07.942
Oh, I love Chinese.

24:07.976 --> 24:10.044
It always reminds me of
that weekend in New York.

24:10.078 --> 24:13.013
We didn't talk about going to
parties or socializing with friends,

24:13.048 --> 24:15.015
or any of that over that
weekend in New York, did we?

24:15.050 --> 24:18.052
No. And we don't have
to talk about that now

24:18.086 --> 24:20.255
because that is not a problem.

24:20.289 --> 24:23.191
If you didn't want to ever socialize
with my friends or ever go out to parties,

24:23.225 --> 24:25.961
then that would be a problem, maybe.

24:25.995 --> 24:27.929
But if just this one
time, you don't want to go,

24:27.964 --> 24:30.231
well, it is your
graduation and I'm gonna do

24:30.266 --> 24:31.967
whatever it is you want to do

24:32.001 --> 24:34.002
because that night is
all about you, not me.

24:34.036 --> 24:35.403
I tell you what, Amy,
if after graduation,

24:35.438 --> 24:40.276
you still want to go to this party,
then you go. I totally trust you.

24:40.310 --> 24:42.945
And if you want to have some
fun with Madison and Lauren,

24:42.980 --> 24:45.281
you should go. And I'll be
happy to stay home with John.

24:45.315 --> 24:50.219
But it's your graduation.
We should celebrate together.

24:50.253 --> 24:52.254
Truthfully, I just can't
wait to get it over with.

24:52.289 --> 24:56.059
Oh, no. I hope I haven't
ruined it for you.

24:56.094 --> 24:58.328
Wait, Ricky, you should be
enjoying every single minute of it.

24:58.363 --> 25:00.097
I, I can't.

25:00.131 --> 25:02.165
Why? Because I've been
pushing you about this party?

25:02.200 --> 25:03.900
I'm so sorry, Ricky. I'm really sorry.

25:03.935 --> 25:06.069
No, it's not that.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.137
What is it?

25:07.171 --> 25:10.207
I'm, you know, the, uh,

25:10.241 --> 25:11.009
valedictorian.

25:11.043 --> 25:15.213
What? Ricky, congratulations!

25:15.247 --> 25:18.116
Oh, my God! [Laughs] That's insane!

25:18.150 --> 25:19.984
That's awesome! That's wonderful!

25:20.319 --> 25:22.253
I love you!

25:22.287 --> 25:23.154
I love you, too.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.990
[Laughs]

25:26.959 --> 25:29.228
What? Is something wrong?

25:29.262 --> 25:32.331
No, no, nothing is wrong.
I just found out today,

25:32.365 --> 25:34.266
and it's a lot of pressure.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.002
And I just want you and
John to be proud of me.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.138
Oh, my gosh! We're so proud of you.

25:39.172 --> 25:42.074
We were proud of you before,
we're proud of you now,

25:42.108 --> 25:43.208
and I just hope you're
proud of yourself.

25:54.055 --> 25:55.155
I love you, Amy.

25:58.259 --> 25:59.325
I love you, too.

26:03.131 --> 26:07.134
Valedictorian! That's insanely good!

26:08.036 --> 26:10.938
Have you talked to your mom lately?

26:10.972 --> 26:12.512
No.

26:25.724 --> 26:25.956
Hi.

26:25.991 --> 26:27.724
Hi.

26:31.927 --> 26:33.794
It's good to see you. Where's Mike?

26:34.829 --> 26:36.629
Oh, Betty called.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.631
After we made our plans Betty called,

26:38.665 --> 26:40.665
her mom died, and I let
Mike take her to the airport.

26:40.699 --> 26:43.734
I'm having her go home
on the corporate jet.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.635
And you didn't want to see her off?

26:46.669 --> 26:50.604
Maybe I should have, but, no,
I didn't want to see her off.

26:50.639 --> 26:52.038
I was looking forward to seeing you.

26:52.072 --> 26:56.607
I was hoping I'd be seeing you
wear that bracelet that I sent you.

26:56.642 --> 26:57.875
You didn't like it?

26:57.909 --> 27:00.543
I loved it. I was hoping that
you would help me put it on.

27:01.845 --> 27:03.511
I'd love to.

27:13.685 --> 27:14.752
Thank you.

27:14.786 --> 27:16.586
Thank you for waiting.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.787
Yeah, 25 years is a long time to wait.

27:20.856 --> 27:23.556
I'm not divorced yet, you know.

27:23.591 --> 27:24.790
But I think it's all gonna go just fine.

27:25.792 --> 27:26.725
I hope so.

27:27.593 --> 27:28.626
I know so.

27:37.666 --> 27:38.666
Want to go to dinner?

27:40.634 --> 27:41.767
I'd love to go to dinner.

27:47.738 --> 27:50.606
We'll come and get you in
10 minutes, Mrs. Boykewich.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.508
Sorry, last minute call,
we just want to make sure

27:53.542 --> 27:54.808
that everything is perfect for you.

27:54.842 --> 27:56.742
Oh, thank you.

27:56.777 --> 27:59.444
Well, just make sure
the wings are perfect.

27:59.478 --> 28:00.679
That's all I'm really worried about.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.479
You know, the wings falling off.

28:03.514 --> 28:05.481
I'm sure the wings are fine.

28:05.516 --> 28:07.516
We're just making sure that
the catering is in place.

28:07.550 --> 28:11.484
Oh, good, 'cause I'm really hungry.

28:11.519 --> 28:13.652
You know, all this grieving
that I have been doing

28:13.687 --> 28:16.587
has just given me a
really huge appetite.

28:16.622 --> 28:18.455
We'll be right back to get you.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.089
OK.

28:26.695 --> 28:27.560
[Clears throat]

28:27.594 --> 28:29.861
So sorry to hear about your loss.

28:30.863 --> 28:32.496
May I sit down?

28:32.531 --> 28:33.564
Mmm-hmm.

28:33.598 --> 28:37.700
Uh, it wasn't your husband
by any chance, was it?

28:37.734 --> 28:40.802
Oh, no. No, it wasn't my husband.

28:40.836 --> 28:43.637
My husband and I are getting a divorce.

28:43.671 --> 28:47.605
What! Who would divorce a
lovely lady such as yourself?

28:47.640 --> 28:48.673
Leo Boykewich.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.541
The sausage king?

28:50.575 --> 28:52.775
Yeah, but actually I was the
one that asked for the divorce.

28:53.544 --> 28:56.510
I'm gonna go back to college.

28:56.545 --> 28:58.745
And I'm starting a
whole new life on my own.

29:00.815 --> 29:02.614
Divorce attorney.

29:02.649 --> 29:06.583
If I could be of any help
whatsoever, you give me a call.

29:06.617 --> 29:10.453
And I am very sorry for your loss.

29:10.487 --> 29:11.786
Oh, well, thank you.

29:14.522 --> 29:16.656
So, you have your own jet?

29:16.690 --> 29:19.424
Belongs to a client of mine.

29:19.459 --> 29:22.526
And you too could have a jet,
sweetheart, if you want one.

29:22.827 --> 29:24.461
Really?

29:25.562 --> 29:26.528
[Laughs]

29:28.630 --> 29:31.498
I'll think about it. No. I will. I will.

29:31.532 --> 29:33.566
I promise.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.833
I miss you.

29:34.867 --> 29:37.768
In fact, I miss you so
much I just might do it.

29:37.802 --> 29:41.704
[Laughs] OK. OK.

29:41.739 --> 29:42.871
Goodnight. I love you.

29:44.539 --> 29:46.640
You might just do what?

29:46.675 --> 29:50.809
Oh, I just might go
to Kenya to meet Jeff

29:50.844 --> 29:53.444
and stay in this resort
with him for a week.

29:53.479 --> 29:54.678
Just so we can see each other, and...

29:54.712 --> 29:57.513
[Sighs]

29:57.547 --> 30:01.682
Honey, I don't know. I
miss him. I really do.

30:01.716 --> 30:03.584
I just don't know if I
would ever move there.

30:04.852 --> 30:08.519
You know, although I've
never been anywhere in Africa,

30:08.553 --> 30:09.754
so, maybe I should go.

30:09.788 --> 30:12.856
If you go, when might you be going?

30:12.890 --> 30:16.657
I might be going the week school is out.

30:16.692 --> 30:17.759
That would be the best time to go.

30:17.793 --> 30:18.525
I think.

30:20.494 --> 30:22.528
Yeah. Mmm-hmm. That would.

30:22.562 --> 30:23.328
Did you need me for something?

30:23.362 --> 30:24.829
Did you want to ask me something?

30:24.864 --> 30:27.698
No. I just want to
get something to drink.

30:27.731 --> 30:30.532
Oh. OK.

30:30.566 --> 30:33.567
You didn't want to ask me something
about some party at a lake house?

30:35.703 --> 30:39.571
Oh, yeah, that party. And
yeah, I hadn't really decided

30:39.606 --> 30:41.639
if it was something
I wanted to go to yet.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.773
You know, with Daniel.

30:43.674 --> 30:45.441
He's in college

30:45.475 --> 30:48.409
and I don't know if I want to
take him to a high school party.

30:48.444 --> 30:49.743
How did you even know about that?

30:49.778 --> 30:50.811
How else?

30:50.845 --> 30:54.446
[Sighs] Damn Jack!

30:54.814 --> 30:56.747
Hello, ladies.

30:56.782 --> 30:59.516
Hello, Jack.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.517
I hate it when you get to my
mother with information before I do.

31:01.551 --> 31:03.418
Oh, you mean the party.

31:03.453 --> 31:04.819
Yeah, I was just telling her
that if you didn't go with Daniel,

31:04.853 --> 31:07.587
that I could give you a ride
and I'd keep an eye on you.

31:07.622 --> 31:09.522
I don't need you to keep an eye on me.

31:09.556 --> 31:10.256
I don't need you to give a ride.

31:10.290 --> 31:11.723
I can get a ride with Adrian.

31:11.757 --> 31:14.558
Well, I haven't even said
that you could go yet.

31:14.592 --> 31:16.659
Can I go? May I go?

31:16.693 --> 31:18.760
Maybe, I need to think about it.

31:18.795 --> 31:20.462
And it depends on who you're going with.

31:20.496 --> 31:21.695
I might want to talk
to the parents first.

31:22.731 --> 31:24.697
Goodnight.

31:26.566 --> 31:27.666
I will get you a number.

31:27.700 --> 31:28.866
Thank you.

31:34.704 --> 31:36.471
Maybe I don't want to go to that party.

31:37.772 --> 31:38.639
Or maybe you do.

31:38.673 --> 31:41.340
I mean, if your boyfriend wants to go,

31:41.375 --> 31:42.607
or if he'll let you go alone.

31:42.642 --> 31:44.342
He doesn't tell me what to do.

31:44.377 --> 31:45.442
I just don't want to go
unless he wants to go.

31:46.778 --> 31:48.444
I don't think.

31:48.479 --> 31:49.512
All right. Well, whatever.

31:49.547 --> 31:51.747
Look, I need your help with something.

31:51.781 --> 31:53.614
Oh, yeah. What?

31:53.649 --> 31:55.549
I'm saying the prayer
for the graduating class.

31:55.583 --> 31:59.384
[Laughs] Are you kidding?

31:59.418 --> 32:00.451
You're like the worst
public speaker ever.

32:03.521 --> 32:06.488
Jack, you're giving
the graduation prayer.

32:07.657 --> 32:09.490
I'll totally help you.

32:09.524 --> 32:10.558
Thanks, grace.

32:10.592 --> 32:12.692
It'll be my graduation present to you.

32:13.627 --> 32:14.626
Good night.

32:18.729 --> 32:22.698
She was always a sucker
for helping people.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.632
Shh. I know that.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.400
I need a favor.

32:26.434 --> 32:28.401
What's that?

32:28.435 --> 32:31.670
I would really like to go to that party.

32:36.607 --> 32:37.607
[Knocking on door]

32:40.642 --> 32:42.443
It's me. It's Omar.

32:48.647 --> 32:49.547
[Exhales sharply]

32:52.649 --> 32:56.318
And, uh, what made you think
I'd be alone and at home?

32:56.352 --> 32:59.652
[Chuckles] I wasn't thinking,
I was just hoping and praying.

33:24.735 --> 33:26.535
I can't stay.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.669
I just wanted to do that.

33:28.704 --> 33:31.605
I've been thinking about doing
that since the last time I saw you.

33:31.639 --> 33:35.441
Made you forget about your old
boyfriend for a few seconds, didn't I?

33:35.475 --> 33:38.375
Not your husband, your old boyfriend.

33:38.409 --> 33:40.509
You know I just ruined
him for you, right?

33:40.544 --> 33:43.545
'Cause if you ever kiss him again,

33:43.579 --> 33:47.381
you're gonna be thinking about
me and that kiss that we just had.

33:49.316 --> 33:51.250
Whoa! Don't go.

33:51.284 --> 33:55.452
Oh, no, no, no. You
got to be sure about me.

33:55.486 --> 33:56.686
Because I'm sure about you.

33:58.388 --> 34:00.455
So when you know in your heart of hearts

34:00.586 --> 34:03.455
that you are no longer in love
with that man, you let me know.

34:15.501 --> 34:16.618
[Chuckles softly]

34:23.043 --> 34:24.382
Hey, look who's here! Are you guys...

34:26.360 --> 34:30.043
Look, Ben, we don't want to
get into this at school today.

34:30.077 --> 34:32.186
No, because it's no
one's business but ours.

34:32.221 --> 34:34.195
What is no one's business but ours?

34:37.445 --> 34:41.262
OK, there is no custody agreement.

34:41.295 --> 34:45.380
You cannot have custody of me,
either one of you. This is ridiculous.

34:45.415 --> 34:46.721
We've all been friends
since the third grade,

34:46.755 --> 34:50.204
and you're gonna have to figure
out a way to still be friends.

34:50.237 --> 34:53.485
Be friends! I want you to be friends.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.232
It's not gonna happen
overnight, but it should happen

34:56.266 --> 34:57.538
before the first holiday where
I'm assigned to one of you.

35:00.352 --> 35:02.427
We've decided that we
will never be friends.

35:02.462 --> 35:04.503
And because we'll never be friends...

35:04.538 --> 35:07.349
We shouldn't be friends with
you either, either one of us.

35:07.385 --> 35:09.293
For the time being.

35:09.327 --> 35:11.603
It just makes things more
painful for both of us.

35:11.637 --> 35:16.526
Oh. And why shouldn't I be in pain too?

35:16.560 --> 35:20.545
As if I haven't been in
enough pain already this year?

35:20.579 --> 35:24.228
Did you two make this decision
with my feelings in mind at all?

35:24.264 --> 35:25.333
No, of course not.

35:25.369 --> 35:26.438
It's all about the two of you.

35:26.474 --> 35:27.545
The whole world is about the two of you.

35:27.579 --> 35:30.457
Fine. Goodbye. We'll all break up then.

35:31.564 --> 35:32.601
Bye, Ben.

35:36.621 --> 35:39.366
[Whispering] So, I'm only
allowed to say bye or goodbye.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.471
[Loudly] So, goodbye.

35:40.505 --> 35:41.576
[Whispers] I'll call you!

35:41.611 --> 35:43.352
Alice: We agreed, Henry!

35:45.362 --> 35:46.399
Bye.

35:50.552 --> 35:51.352
[Sighs]

35:54.538 --> 35:56.513
[Knocking on door]

35:56.547 --> 35:59.627
Hey, good morning. Did I hear Alice?

35:59.661 --> 36:00.532
Did Alice come by?

36:00.566 --> 36:03.478
Alice and Henry.

36:03.512 --> 36:05.723
Jeez, this is one nasty break-up.

36:07.598 --> 36:09.808
[Sighs] Lot of break-ups are.

36:09.843 --> 36:11.751
You and I have been lucky that way.

36:13.493 --> 36:14.831
We were able to dissolve our marriages

36:14.866 --> 36:16.707
without any of that awful stuff.

36:17.780 --> 36:20.625
Of course, our exes,

36:20.659 --> 36:22.635
I can't believe I'm even
saying that, "our exes."

36:22.669 --> 36:26.486
Anyway, they each had something
they were excited about.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.663
Something that's gonna
be better for them.

36:28.697 --> 36:32.547
So, if you could find
something better for those two,

36:32.582 --> 36:33.820
maybe that would help.

36:33.855 --> 36:35.829
Uh, I was hoping Henry would
go to this graduation party

36:35.864 --> 36:37.738
at Jesse's lake house.

36:37.772 --> 36:40.685
Well, his parents' lake
house, he's Lauren's boyfriend.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.528
He's inviting a lot of people

36:42.562 --> 36:43.666
and I was hoping there
might be someone there

36:43.700 --> 36:44.838
for each of us to get excited about.

36:45.810 --> 36:47.785
What party?

36:47.819 --> 36:49.125
Oh, it's, uh, it's on
the last day of school.

36:49.159 --> 36:52.641
Graduation is that night and
Jesse invited a bunch of people

36:52.676 --> 36:53.746
to drive up there and spend
the night at the cabin.

36:53.781 --> 36:54.818
And what night is that?

36:56.761 --> 36:57.463
Why?

36:57.497 --> 36:58.937
You're gonna be gone all night?

36:58.972 --> 37:03.994
[Chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so have fun.

37:04.028 --> 37:06.740
Don't worry about me, the guy who
just lost his two best friends.

37:06.774 --> 37:10.926
I'm sure you'll all be
back together in no time.

37:10.961 --> 37:13.002
You're just high from your
dinner with Camille last night.

37:14.042 --> 37:14.944
Maybe.

37:18.931 --> 37:19.968
[Knocking on door]

37:26.768 --> 37:27.972
Hey, what are you doing here?

37:28.006 --> 37:29.010
I've been up all night.

37:29.849 --> 37:32.862
OK. Doing what?

37:35.106 --> 37:36.847
Oh, no. Omar?

37:36.882 --> 37:39.961
No. No, not exactly.

37:39.996 --> 37:42.038
But Omar did come by last night.

37:42.072 --> 37:43.076
But he left two minutes later.

37:43.111 --> 37:44.751
And?

37:44.785 --> 37:46.961
And he kissed me.

37:46.995 --> 37:51.113
Oh, I had assumed you guys had
already done more than just kissed.

37:51.148 --> 37:52.052
No. Why would you assume that?

37:54.128 --> 37:55.936
Never mind.

37:55.971 --> 37:58.180
He kissed me. And it was...

37:58.214 --> 38:02.098
I don't know, it was
powerful and hypnotic.

38:02.132 --> 38:04.945
I can't get him out of my
mind, I really can't, grace.

38:04.979 --> 38:08.126
I have never been kissed
like that by anyone before.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.131
Not even Ricky?

38:09.165 --> 38:12.078
Well, uh, you see, the thing is...

38:12.112 --> 38:13.518
Uh-oh.

38:13.552 --> 38:18.173
It's been a long time since I have
kissed Ricky, a very long time.

38:18.207 --> 38:21.053
So, I really have to kiss him again.

38:22.896 --> 38:25.005
I have to. My life depends on it.

38:26.111 --> 38:27.249
So how can I do that?

38:27.283 --> 38:30.999
[Chuckles] I know, I
know, he's an idiot.

38:32.273 --> 38:34.148
Oh, gotta go. Yeah, bye.

38:35.254 --> 38:38.133
So, you and the ex
talking about me again?

38:39.239 --> 38:41.951
You're not the only idiot we know.

38:41.985 --> 38:43.324
So you were talking to Anne.

38:43.358 --> 38:47.979
No. Not necessarily.

38:48.013 --> 38:50.189
Hey, did you hear who's valedictorian

38:50.224 --> 38:51.294
at grant high school this year?

38:52.400 --> 38:54.207
Amy?

38:54.243 --> 38:56.251
Amy is not graduating
from high school this year.

38:56.285 --> 38:57.590
I thought you meant in the coming year.

38:57.625 --> 39:01.040
I said, "this year." Jeez, you
really are a bad communicator.

39:01.074 --> 39:02.245
Is that what she said?
That I'm a bad communicator?

39:02.280 --> 39:03.350
I'm not a bad communicator,

39:03.385 --> 39:05.159
I just don't tell her everything.

39:05.194 --> 39:07.336
I am trying to tell you something!

39:07.370 --> 39:10.216
Well, then you're the bad
communicator. Try harder.

39:10.250 --> 39:13.397
Ricky is valedictorian.

39:13.432 --> 39:17.249
Ricky who? Your Ricky?
Amy's Ricky? He's that smart?

39:17.283 --> 39:19.091
Yes, he's that smart, apparently.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.196
He called me this morning to tell me.

39:20.230 --> 39:22.406
And Amy called Anne, and...

39:22.440 --> 39:24.248
And that's what he must have come
over here to tell me last night.

39:24.283 --> 39:26.224
Why would he come all the
way over here to tell you,

39:26.258 --> 39:28.401
when he called me this morning?
He would have called you.

39:28.435 --> 39:30.243
Well, what else would he have
come over here to tell me?

39:30.277 --> 39:32.319
Well, I don't know but
if he came over here

39:32.353 --> 39:35.333
to tell you that, he would have
just told you in front of...

39:37.344 --> 39:38.347
Oh!

39:38.381 --> 39:39.452
What?

39:39.487 --> 39:43.304
I bet he's gonna ask Amy to marry him.

39:45.582 --> 39:48.293
He's got to spend the summer
in juvie? The whole summer?

39:48.328 --> 39:50.336
Just for sending out a naked
picture of his girlfriend?

39:50.370 --> 39:53.584
He's gonna have to do a whole
summer of community service work.

39:53.619 --> 39:56.230
He's gonna be able to
visit us from time to time

39:56.265 --> 39:57.537
on the weekends, if we get permission

39:57.571 --> 40:01.388
from his case worker, which
I would imagine we can.

40:01.422 --> 40:04.302
But he's not moving here until the fall,

40:04.336 --> 40:08.286
and that's only if he behaves
himself during the summer.

40:08.321 --> 40:10.598
But that's not what you're
here for, to ask about that,

40:10.632 --> 40:11.635
what's going on?

40:14.617 --> 40:16.391
Couple of things.

40:16.425 --> 40:17.596
A couple of things? Like what?

40:17.631 --> 40:20.410
I'm valedictorian of my class.

40:24.362 --> 40:25.533
Well,

40:27.443 --> 40:29.318
isn't that something?

40:29.352 --> 40:33.403
I am so proud and I
know Shakur will be, too.

40:33.438 --> 40:37.356
Top of your class. Valedictorian.

40:37.390 --> 40:38.628
[Chuckles]

40:38.663 --> 40:43.417
Good for you, son, good for you.

40:43.451 --> 40:46.632
I couldn't be any happier
than I am right in this moment.

40:46.667 --> 40:49.780
Yeah, well, hold on to that feeling

40:49.814 --> 40:51.655
because I have something
else to tell you,

40:51.690 --> 40:54.669
and I don't know how
you're gonna feel about it.

40:54.704 --> 40:57.616
You're gonna ask Amy to
marry you. Is that it?

40:57.651 --> 40:58.655
Yeah.

40:58.689 --> 41:00.865
[Laughs] Yes!

41:01.770 --> 41:03.611
I knew it. I could

41:03.645 --> 41:07.529
feel it in my bones the
last time I saw you with her.

41:07.564 --> 41:09.774
Of course, it goes against
everything I always thought,

41:09.808 --> 41:12.553
but I have to tell you,

41:13.659 --> 41:15.835
I'm... I'm thrilled.

41:15.869 --> 41:20.523
I'm absolutely thrilled for both of you.

41:20.558 --> 41:21.830
Well, she hasn't said yes yet.

41:21.864 --> 41:24.125
Well, what could possibly happen that

41:24.275 --> 41:26.354
she wouldn't say yes

41:26.519 --> 41:30.355
to a proposal of marriage from you?
