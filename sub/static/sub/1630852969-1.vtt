I've been fishing my whole entire

02:05.392 --> 02:07.993
If you were to tell me ten
years ago when I was a mate on

02:07.995 --> 02:09.862
the Dot-Com that we
could have a chance to

02:09.930 --> 02:12.331

02:12.399 --> 02:13.932

I'm gonna win this year.

DOUG: You know the big thing is you can't
worry about what other people are doing.

fishing and continuing to catch.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.610

02:38.091 --> 02:39.357
We're waiting.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.426
We had high hopes in
getting one during the night,

02:41.428 --> 02:42.761
but no luck yet.

02:42.763 --> 02:46.765
It's crucial today
that we get a bite,

02:46.833 --> 02:50.836
'cause after today, the fishery
closes for a couple days and

02:50.904 --> 02:54.439
we'll probably only have a
few days after the break before

02:54.508 --> 02:55.908
the quota's all gone.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.311
I just gotta
keep the boat on fish.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.781
And if we can get another
bluefin before Paul does,

03:02.783 --> 03:05.517
that'll put us in a great
spot going into this break.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.453

could've put on a shoe.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.402
SANDRO: People
should be chasing us.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.137
We shouldn't be chasing people.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.539
GEORDIE: Yup. No doubt.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.141
DAVE: Remember, this
season was all about what?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.275
GEORDIE: Helping
each other out.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.211
DAVE: Helping each other
out and that's what we did.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.012
GEORDIE: Almost everyone.
DAVE: Expect for one person.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.414
SANDRO: I don't know
who's gonna, I mean.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.748
GEORDIE: Marciano.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.083
SANDRO: He kind
of snuck up there.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.351
GEORDIE: He did.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.886
In four days, the whole thing
could go up on its head again.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.423
Marciano misses a day or
two, then there goes that.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.092
Paul could keep
right on his streak here.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.227
DAVE: Well, if it's not gonna
be us, it better be Paul.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.229
SANDRO: We maybe
catch one or two more...

03:51.232 --> 03:52.364
DAVE: Yep.

03:52.432 --> 03:53.031
SANDRO: Before this year's
over 'cause it's definitely

03:53.033 --> 03:54.299
coming down to the wire.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.634
No doubt about that.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.835
GEORDIE: Waiting
for the buzzer.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.704
SANDRO: Yeah, exactly.
GEORDIE: The white flag.

03:58.772 --> 03:59.971
One lap to go.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.973
SANDRO: We're not even getting
a two-minute warning either.

04:01.976 --> 04:02.908
GEORDIE: No.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.076
SANDRO: When they
call it, they call it.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.319
JACK: This is
Southern Jeffreys.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.722
This is a
textbook giant tuna spot.

04:17.725 --> 04:21.093
You know, especially on rough
weather days, they love to chew here.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.363
Holy (bleep), just rolled over.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.733
You know, this thing
could be shut down,

04:27.801 --> 04:29.468
you know, whenever.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.936
We're not where we
wanna be right now and, um,

04:31.939 --> 04:34.072
we're no doubt the
underdogs in this competition.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.009
All the hook-ups and all
the fish we've had, you know,

04:37.077 --> 04:40.679
we should be right up there
with the top boat and, um,

04:40.747 --> 04:42.948
you know, it, it sucks to
be where we are right now,

04:43.016 --> 04:44.883
but try not to
count the fish until

04:44.885 --> 04:46.418
we're done fishing
at the end of the year,

04:46.486 --> 04:48.920
then I look back and,
you know, see what we did.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.558
NICHOLAS: We set out this
season to prove something and

04:53.560 --> 04:55.294
catch as many fish as possible.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.562
You know, it's been a bit of a
bumpy road for us this season.

04:58.365 --> 05:01.232
Got more bites than
just about any boat, I mean,

05:01.235 --> 05:03.068
we just had real
bad luck this year.

05:03.087 --> 05:04.770
But we're still
out here grinding,

05:04.838 --> 05:07.172
ten toes down on the
deck doing everything we can

05:07.240 --> 05:09.207
until that final buzzer rings.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.716
(reel clicking)

05:17.784 --> 05:19.050
(reel unspooling rapidly)

05:19.053 --> 05:20.585
Got 'em on.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.388
Pulled it right out of my hand.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.990

05:26.126 --> 05:31.296

JACK: Yeah.

05:35.269 --> 05:37.402

Let me get in, let me get in.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.476
JACK: Feels like
a good one here.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.010
NICHOLAS: Everything's

05:46.013 --> 05:47.145

05:47.214 --> 05:48.580
JACK: Roger.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.953
NICHOLAS: Oh.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.755
Want me to go in reverse?

05:56.823 --> 05:58.623
JACK: No, just point
engines right at him.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.891
NICHOLAS: Yup.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.159
JACK: A little bit
of gear out, out and around.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.560
Neutral!

06:02.563 --> 06:04.496
NICHOLAS: Neutral!

06:06.700 --> 06:08.600
JACK: Gear out this way.
NICHOLAS: Yup. Little gear.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.835
JACK: Neutral!

06:10.838 --> 06:12.437
NICHOLAS: 150.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.474
JACK: Color!
All right, come up.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.645
NICHOLAS: I'm ready.

06:27.654 --> 06:28.653
(grunts)

06:28.655 --> 06:29.321
Got him!

06:29.389 --> 06:33.425
JACK: Tail rope!
The tail gaff.

06:36.997 --> 06:41.599
Get his tail.
Fast, put it on.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.135
Woo-hoo! Woo!

06:43.203 --> 06:44.803
Oh, (bleep), yeah.

06:44.871 --> 06:45.737
NICHOLAS: That's
right, baby.

06:45.806 --> 06:46.738
Woo!

06:46.807 --> 06:48.072
JACK: It's been a weird year.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.475
Nick and I know we can
come out here and, you know,

06:50.544 --> 06:51.743
fish with the best of them.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.478
We got this one and
hopefully we can get a

06:53.480 --> 06:55.747
chance to come out
and catch another one.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.282
NICHOLAS: 92 on the money.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.083
JACK: 92.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.552
He's fat, bro. He's fat.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.020
NICHOLAS: I'll take
that all day, dude.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.221
JACK: Real fat.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.024
Needed that one.
We needed you, buddy.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.661
NICHOLAS: Thank you.
JACK: Thank you, tuna gods.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.374
MARCIANO: So many times I think
about getting in that bow one up there.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.576
JASON: I'm gonna go up to,
we're gonna bring that up.

07:24.644 --> 07:25.377
MARCIANO: Sure,
whatever you want to do.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.378
However you need to do it.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.579
JASON: I'll just bring it up.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.180
MARCIANO: For
these final days,

07:29.183 --> 07:31.850
we're off on our own again
doing whatever we can to

07:31.852 --> 07:33.385
set ourselves up for success.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.253
Need somebody up to the bow?

07:35.255 --> 07:36.788
JASON: No, I think I got it.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.257
MARCIANO: The fleet may be mad
that we've done our own thing this season,

07:39.326 --> 07:42.727
but the fact of the matter is, we
do our best when we keep quiet

07:42.729 --> 07:44.529
and fish away from everyone.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.530
JASON: Am I
bringing two up here?

07:45.599 --> 07:46.665
JOE: I don't know.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.333
MARCIANO: Yeah, move it up
here if you have to, Jay.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.001
Yup.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.605
We've had the comeback of the decade and
I just want to focus on winning this thing

07:53.607 --> 07:55.407
for me and my crew.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.243
We deserve this.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.413
JOE: All right, now,
we're ready to hook up.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.014
I think next mark,
we're gonna go.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.349
MARCIANO: Yup.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.952
This is when we get bites in
here when the tide's doing this.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.420
PAUL: Oh, I
hope we get a jumbo.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.289
We need to seal the deal today.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.859
Pull ahead of the
Hard Merch before the break.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.694
We're gonna get one.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.836

Right? Like a grander.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.780

Marking.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.317
DOUG: Now, that's a mark.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.652
RICK: Game time, baby.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.986
PAUL: I hope we
hook up right now.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.121
DOUG: Me too.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.990
One of these things has to bite.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.725
Come on, at least
give us a shot here.

He's wild.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.604
When you get a lot of line out, you
have to back the drag down a little.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.272
There's so much
line in the water,

10:07.340 --> 10:10.074
it actually creates more
drag and the further you get

10:10.077 --> 10:12.010
down on the spool,
the more drag as well.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.213
So you've got to be careful that you
don't put too much pressure on the fish

10:15.215 --> 10:16.481
and pop the line.

DOUG: That's all we can do.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.251
PAUL: Seal the deal.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.120
DOUG: Top it off, last fish of
the year, biggest fish of the year.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.321
RICK: Let's do it.
Let's do it, boys.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.322
PAUL: One more fish.
Let's do it.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.657
I'm gonna warm the
boat up, all right?

17:39.659 --> 17:40.525
RICK: Yeah! Yeah!
PAUL: Let's do this thing.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.859
RICK: All right, guys.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.929
PAUL: We've been the
underdogs every single year.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.598
This is our time to shine.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.867
DAVE: That's it.
I mean, this is the last day.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.802
SANDRO: We all thought we were
gonna have a couple more days, I guess not.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.737
All right.
Let's rock and roll.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.605
Let's get out of here.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.941
GEORDIE: What are
we parked here for?

17:56.943 --> 17:58.943
BOB: This is it.
The quota's done.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.611
I'd like to get
third place here.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.680
Let's end it well, so.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.682
JOHN: Get 'em.
Go out with a bang.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.551
JARRETT: It's been
a weird season, man.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.553
TJ: Let's cast the lines
and try to get one more, bro.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.688
Let's end this
thing on a high note.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.756
JACK: Go down to Cape Cod Bay
and bring a slob home.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.825
NICHOLAS: Let's
go get 'em, bud.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.026
JACK: Let's go do it.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.294
Back home with a big one.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.696
Last chance today.

18:18.698 --> 18:19.897
TYLER: Let's get
up there to the meat.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.232
MARISSA: Let's go.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.633
TYLER: You know,
it's do or die out here.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.769
You know, we might not be
finishing out on top of the competition,

18:24.837 --> 18:26.103
but we still want to save face.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.156
We still want to
have a strong finish.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.651
DAVE: Paul wants
to secure his spot.

18:40.720 --> 18:45.122
He doesn't want to let
Hard Merch anywhere near him.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.458
And we need a big one
to secure our spot.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.126
And this is the place to do it.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.595
Cape Cod Bay.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.563
We're all spread out
in these final hours.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.866
Whether down here in the bay,

18:54.934 --> 18:57.201
close to home,
or up north near Maine,

18:57.203 --> 18:58.869
one thing's for sure,

18:58.872 --> 19:01.272
the right location is
going to be what determines

19:01.340 --> 19:03.207
the outcome of the season.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.577
There's no more time
for second chances.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.681
GEORDIE: Did we turn the
live well pump off on purpose?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.416
DAVE: No. Why, are they dying?

19:12.485 --> 19:13.618
GEORDIE: No.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.269
The pump is not pumping water.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.088
DAVE: Oh, no.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.290
The pump probably died.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.824
Get that working because
without that bait bump,

19:20.827 --> 19:23.093
we have no bait and
that's the end of our day.

19:23.096 --> 19:24.228
We need to catch.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.963
GEORDIE: I'll go
work on that, (bleep).

19:27.700 --> 19:29.233
SANDRO: Did the pump die?

19:29.302 --> 19:31.635
GEORDIE: The pump (bleep)
the bed it sounds like.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.104
SANDRO: Sabotage.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.306
DAVE: This is why
we carry spares.

19:35.374 --> 19:38.776
(reel clicking)

19:41.514 --> 19:42.246
(reel unspooling rapidly)

19:42.315 --> 19:43.180
SANDRO: We're on!

19:43.183 --> 19:44.448
DAVE: We're on!
We're on! We're on!

19:44.450 --> 19:45.716
That's him, right?

19:45.718 --> 19:48.052
SANDRO: I think so.
Just took a lot of line out.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.587
He's just kept
going faster and faster.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.493
SANDRO: Every time he
tries to run, he just stops.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.001
DAVE: It does
give us one break.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.003
If it's gonna be a break, this
is the break we need right here.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.805
GEORDIE: Stop saying break.
SANDRO: Yeah, enough.

20:07.807 --> 20:08.906
(laughter)

20:12.612 --> 20:13.277
SANDRO: Oh, we're on, baby.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.879
GEORDIE: Yeah, we're on.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.082
GEORDIE: We're on.
SANDRO: Woo-hoo! Baby!

20:23.556 --> 20:24.955
(Spooling rapidly)

20:24.958 --> 20:26.357
SANDRO: That's a fish.
GEORDIE: Oh, we're on, baby.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.794
DAVE: Yeah, we're on.
SANDRO: Woo-hoo! Baby!

20:33.299 --> 20:34.365
Coming right up.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.000
GEORDIE: Straight
up and down now, Dave.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.104
GEORDIE: Color.
Tail wrap. Tail wrap.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.572
DAVE: Tail rope, you
don't even need to gaff it.

20:41.641 --> 20:45.243
SANDRO: Yep, get the gaff.
Get a gaff. Get a gaff.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.644
(overlapping chatter)

20:46.646 --> 20:47.945
SANDRO: I can't see anything.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.583
DAVE: Tail rope.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.253
SANDRO: Hold on.
Let me get this.

20:55.321 --> 20:55.986
Woo!

20:55.989 --> 20:56.920
DAVE: You guys ready?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.456
GEORDIE: Yup.
DAVE: All right.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.324
SANDRO: Woo! He's a nice one.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.526
DAVE: Wow. My God.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.728
SANDRO: That's a
beauty to end the season.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.263
GEORDIE: No wonder he didn't,
he couldn't swim anywhere.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.797
He was, he's too fat.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.265
DAVE: Let's measure him up.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.801
GEORDIE: 96.
SANDRO: Bam!

21:10.803 --> 21:12.069
SANDRO: We got one.
Ended on a good note.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.138
GEORDIE: Yeah,
good going, buddy, good year.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.324
SANDRO: Yeah.
GEORDIE: Always a joy.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.708
SANDRO: Nice one
to end the year on.

21:22.081 --> 21:22.746
PATRICK: What's
going on, Dave?

21:22.749 --> 21:23.748
DAVE: This is it.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.682
This is the last day
for us and everybody else.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.684
So hopefully you
take care of us.

21:26.752 --> 21:28.018
PATRICK: Yeah,
let's check it out.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.687
DAVE: You're
gonna like this one.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.222
This is what we needed.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.024
Something that's gonna
give us the last paycheck.

21:33.092 --> 21:36.160
And we were hoping for
another day, but it didn't happen.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.429
What do you got, PJ?
What's the dress weight?

21:38.431 --> 21:40.164
PATRICK: 391 pounds dressed.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.432
SANDRO: Good way
to end it there.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.301
GEORDIE: That's a nice fish.
That's nice.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.635
PATRICK: Let's check the meat
out and see what we got here.

21:44.704 --> 21:45.369
DAVE: Let's go.
GEORDIE: All right.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.404
SANDRO: Sounds good.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.648
Woo, that's nice.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.317
PATRICK: Nice
looking tail cut, guys.

21:59.385 --> 22:01.518
You saved the
best for last, huh?

22:01.521 --> 22:02.453
GEORDIE: That's a pretty one.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.854
PATRICK: This is a
solid looking fish.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.322
Rosy color is nice.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.390
Got some oil.

22:06.392 --> 22:07.925
The core looks very nice.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.027
It's got a great
band of skin fat here.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.363
This one here...

22:15.134 --> 22:16.734
I can get you
$13 a pound for it.

22:16.736 --> 22:17.802
GEORDIE: Sweet.
DAVE: I'll take that, (bleep).

22:17.870 --> 22:18.936
SANDRO: Yeah.
Great way to end it.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.137
GEORDIE: That's nice.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.672
PATRICK: All right.
Well, thank you, gentlemen.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.806
Thank you, Dave,
for all the fish.

22:22.809 --> 22:23.807
DAVE: Thank you, PJ.
PATRICK: See you, Geordie.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.142
DAVE: See you in town.
Thank you very much.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.610
PATRICK: All right. Take care.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.612
SANDRO: Until next year.
PATRICK: You, too.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.948
DAVE: We're sitting
in a pretty good spot.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.349
We know we're not
gonna be first or second.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.484
It's gonna be between...

22:33.552 --> 22:34.752
GEORDIE: Paul and Marciano.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.520
DAVE: Yeah.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.024
TYLER: Hey, Merm.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.159
We really gotta get one today.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.627
The desperation is on.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.229
I mean, we're just trying to save
face so I can go back to Gloucester.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.631
I don't have to wear a brown paper bag
on my head that says no-name fisherman

22:48.434 --> 22:50.901
because I'm gonna be too
embarrassed to be known.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.007
I am patiently
waiting and I'm ready.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.377
(beeping)

22:59.445 --> 23:01.312
Oh, marked one.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.247
Come on.
Let's get a bite here.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.982
MARISSA: This is the spot.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.517
(reel clicking)

23:06.519 --> 23:07.851
(reel unspooling rapidly)

23:07.854 --> 23:08.986
TYLER: We're on!

23:09.054 --> 23:10.187
MARISSA: Whoa!

23:10.189 --> 23:11.589
TYLER: We're on!
We're on! We're on!

23:11.657 --> 23:15.109
Anchor! Woo!

23:15.528 --> 23:16.260
Woo!

23:16.328 --> 23:18.062
How do you like me now, pally?

23:18.130 --> 23:20.063
MARISSA: Wow,
he took a lot of line out.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.934
TYLER: Oh, yeah!
Nice big bite right there.

23:23.936 --> 23:27.538
Last day of fishing
got to capitalize on this.

23:27.606 --> 23:28.672
Ready to rumble, Merm?

23:28.674 --> 23:30.207
MARISSA: Last fish!

23:30.209 --> 23:31.876
TYLER: Definitely
a big bruiser.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.012
You get to work, Merm!

23:35.080 --> 23:36.079
Don't lose it!

23:36.082 --> 23:37.081
MARISSA: Feels like a big one.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.149
TYLER: Don't lose it.

23:39.152 --> 23:41.819
All right, Merm.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.022
Atta girl, doing good, Merm.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.691
Woo! We need this one, bad.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.895
Oh, no. Watch that tip.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.564
MARISSA: Whoa.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.799
TYLER: Oh, no.

23:56.302 --> 23:57.635
MARISSA: What?

23:57.703 --> 23:59.103
TYLER: He's still taking it!

23:59.171 --> 24:01.038
Wow.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.508
MARISSA: I'm gonna have
to take my sweatshirt off.

24:05.511 --> 24:06.844
TYLER: I'm really
worried right now.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.512
This fish is crazy.

24:08.514 --> 24:10.714
MARISSA: I guess
he's not that hurt yet.

24:10.783 --> 24:11.782
TYLER: Merm's on.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.317
MARISSA: We're on!

24:13.319 --> 24:15.119
Down and tight.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.725
MARISSA: Coming back around.

24:21.727 --> 24:24.528
TYLER: Nice.
Circling out this way.

24:24.530 --> 24:25.362
MARISSA: Swivel.

24:25.398 --> 24:26.330
TYLER: All right,
easy, easy, easy.

24:26.332 --> 24:29.466
Wait, wait, wait.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.201
MARISSA: Color.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.136
TYLER: Color?

24:32.204 --> 24:33.671
MARISSA: Yeah.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.005
TYLER: Oh.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.541
Swivel's right there.
Swivel's right there.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.243
MARISSA: Coming up!

24:42.081 --> 24:43.881
TYLER: We got him. Woo!

24:43.883 --> 24:45.082
And another one!

24:45.150 --> 24:46.417
MARISSA: Epic shot!

24:46.485 --> 24:47.885
TYLER: Ooh! Big boy!

24:47.953 --> 24:50.955
Tail gaff.
Let's go, left side.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.756
Nice! Woo!

24:52.825 --> 24:53.624
MARISSA: Woo!
TYLER: Hell yeah!

24:53.626 --> 24:54.809
MARISSA: Nice job, Ty.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.960
TYLER: Yeah, Merm.
Great job this season, sis.

24:56.963 --> 25:00.564
Good job.
We're going home. Woo!

25:00.633 --> 25:01.698
MARISSA: Couldn't be happier.

25:01.701 --> 25:02.833
TYLER: All right.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.101
Last one of the season and
we're bringing him aboard.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.302
MARISSA: What a jumbo.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.238
TYLER: Wow, what a nice fish.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.440
See how big our
final fish of the season is.

25:09.775 --> 25:11.375
Woo!

25:11.443 --> 25:12.643
98 inches.

25:12.645 --> 25:13.310
MARISSA: Wow.
TYLER: Woo!

25:13.312 --> 25:14.378
MARISSA: Perfect fish.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.579
TYLER: Finish off with
pretty much a 100-incher.

25:15.581 --> 25:16.780
98. Woo!

25:16.782 --> 25:18.181
MARISSA: And it's fat, too.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.117
TYLER: That's a
wrap on this season.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.259
MARCIANO: Change your
bait and change your fate.

25:29.262 --> 25:31.128
Let's go with a squid, man.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.131
JASON: Say hello
to my little friends.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.199
(imitating guns)

25:36.202 --> 25:37.801
MARCIANO: Got some bait here.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.737
Hopefully we got some tuna here.

25:39.805 --> 25:41.505
We came a long way for this.

25:42.675 --> 25:45.009
You gotta risk it if
you want the biscuit.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.610
JASON: That's the biggest one.
MARCIANO: Yeah.

25:46.612 --> 25:49.813
Even though we are losing eight hours
of fishing with the steam back home,

25:50.149 --> 25:52.883
we've still got
about six hours here

25:52.952 --> 25:56.420
to find a nice
high quality Maine bluefin.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.090
Come on, fish.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.792
Let's do this.

26:02.962 --> 26:07.164
Paul apparently heard there
were big fish in Cape Cod,

26:07.166 --> 26:09.533
so we're over
100 miles from each other.

26:10.436 --> 26:12.636
Which champion went
in the right direction?

26:16.041 --> 26:17.841
PAUL: I'm gonna make a wiggle.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.578
RICK: We're still in the hunt.

26:20.646 --> 26:21.912
We're making a
little wiggle here.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.481
Now Paul's jogging up the
bay a little bit for another drift.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.719
We gotta be at the
dock tonight by 11:30 p.m.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.787
if we're gonna unload a fish.

26:30.790 --> 26:35.726
So time is against us, we really
need to focus on this next drift.

26:35.728 --> 26:38.929
Make sure we're ready for anything
because we need to catch a fish.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.531
PAUL: All set, guys.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.133
Dave's in Maine this morning.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.868
I'm more familiar
with this place and

26:44.870 --> 26:46.971
he's more familiar
with that place, that's all.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.007
We come from two,
two different families.

26:50.075 --> 26:52.409
RICK: Look at the rainbow.

26:53.930 --> 26:56.847
PAUL: So may the best man win.

27:04.490 --> 27:09.426
MARCIANO: One more fish.
One more fish.

27:09.428 --> 27:13.497
JOE: All right. Yeah. Sorry.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.766
MARCIANO: I don't know, maybe.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.167
(beeping)

27:17.236 --> 27:17.968
That looks,
that's him, that's him.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.103
Here we go!
There's a whole...

27:19.171 --> 27:20.637
JOE: We're on! We're on!
MARCIANO: We're on! We're on!

27:20.640 --> 27:21.772
JASON: Screamer!

27:21.774 --> 27:23.974
This is why we came to
Maine for these big, big fish.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.843
This is a big one for sure!

27:27.380 --> 27:28.912
MARCIANO: I
almost got it up, Jay!

27:28.981 --> 27:30.313
JASON: Big screamer.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.515
Screamer!

27:31.583 --> 27:33.450
This will put us ahead of Paul!

27:33.519 --> 27:36.620
Everybody's got their game
face on and this is a big fish.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.922
This is a big one.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.991
MARCIANO: This is the
bite we've been waiting for.

27:41.593 --> 27:44.061
ANGELICA: You see there's
gear directly in front of Jay.

27:44.129 --> 27:47.831
JASON: Oh, yeah, gear,
right there, Dave.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.800
Lobster pots.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.835
MARCIANO: Oh, (bleep)!

27:56.075 --> 27:58.342
Let me know if it feels weird
because I'll have to know,

27:58.410 --> 27:59.877
I'll get up on
the other side of it.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.882
I can't tell which side he's on.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.350
Might need a gaff, Joe.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.620
ANGELICA: Yup. Yup.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.322
JASON: Yeah, I feel it.
I definitely feel it.

28:13.626 --> 28:15.859
MARCIANO: Hurry up, Joe.
The line's gonna snap!

28:23.035 --> 28:25.035
JASON: Oh, yeah.
Gear right there, Dave.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.504
MARCIANO: Let me know if it
feels weird because I'll have to know,

28:27.573 --> 28:28.972
I'll get up on
the other side of it.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.908
Might need a gaff, Joe.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.243
ANGELICA: Yup. Yup.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.179
JASON: Yeah, I feel it.
I definitely feel it.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.315
MARCIANO: Alright.
JASON: Can we loosen it?

28:38.650 --> 28:41.318
MARCIANO: Just try
and get that buoy, Joe.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.321
Just be ready to loosen it.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.457
JOE: Got it.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.126
MARCIANO: It's starting
to get tangled up here.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.828
Hurry up, Joe.
The line's gonna snap!

28:52.931 --> 28:55.733
JOE: Over it.
Over it. Over it. Over it.

28:55.801 --> 28:56.934
MARCIANO: All right,
here we go.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.411
JASON: That was a close one.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.280
MARCIANO: Oh.
That was a close one.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.482
Nice work, team! Nice work.
That was a close one!

29:12.885 --> 29:14.017
JASON: Get on this, Gel.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.053
MARCIANO: Oh.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.428
Now that's where experience
matters, a moment just like that.

29:26.565 --> 29:31.235
It might be enough to beat Paul,
but all we got is a bent rod right now.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.636
JASON: Joe, you want
to reel in this thing?

29:32.704 --> 29:33.637
JOE: Yeah.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.773
MARCIANO: Can't do
anything with that.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.679
All right. Coming back here.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.521
JOE: Coming at us.
Deep color. Deep color.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.857
MARCIANO: He's gonna go around
right underneath us and out and around.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.592
JOE: Nice fish guys.
JASON: Keep him coming.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.060
Keep him coming.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.129
This fish could
put us over the top.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.531
MARCIANO: So you
better not miss.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.401
MARCIANO: There you go, Jay.

30:04.403 --> 30:05.869
JOE: Good shot.

30:05.871 --> 30:08.005
Watch your legs, guys.

30:08.541 --> 30:09.940
Gel, get the tail rope.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.074
You got it, Gel.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.409
Last one of the season, Gel.
Finish it off. Come on.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.211
MARCIANO: Right here,
right here, Gel.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.745
JASON: Got him, guys!
Last one of the season!

30:15.748 --> 30:17.080
MARCIANO: All right.
We got him. Well done.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.148
ANGELICA: Yeah!

30:18.217 --> 30:20.350
MARCIANO: Yeah. All right.
Bring it in. Group hug.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.418
JOE: Hey, guys,
way to end the season.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.819
MARCIANO: Well done, team.

30:22.822 --> 30:25.222
Up, up and away hey.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.958
Ready? Yeah. Yeah.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.227
JASON: Coming in! Coming in.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.695
MARCIANO: All right,
here we go.

30:31.714 --> 30:33.230
JOE: There we go.
JASON: Perfect fish.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.832
MARCIANO: Yup,
we did it, gang.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.567
What do we got?

30:36.635 --> 30:37.901
JOE: 86.

30:37.903 --> 30:40.170
MARCIANO: 86.
Hey, it's a beautiful fish.

30:40.172 --> 30:44.174
We'll pack him in the box and get
him ready for that long ride home.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.377
Fish number 14, gang.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.546
This is our season.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.384
(message alert)

30:54.386 --> 30:56.386
BOB: Oh, (bleep).

30:57.522 --> 31:00.523
Marciano got one.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.125
Wow.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.328
JOHN: It's gonna get
real interesting here.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.331
MANNY: It's gonna come
down to, uh, price per pound

31:07.399 --> 31:08.999
and if whether or
not Paul gets one today.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.602
BOB: He is
making it interesting.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.204
(phone ringing)

31:14.273 --> 31:16.273
TJ: Yo.

31:16.341 --> 31:18.809
<i>BOB (over phone):
Marciano got one.</i>

31:19.611 --> 31:21.678
TJ: Looks like the tuna gods
aren't gonna let Paul win.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.614
JARRETT: That sucks.

31:23.682 --> 31:26.016
PAUL: I just got a
text from Dave Marciano.

31:28.353 --> 31:32.289
We're tied up on fish
count right now, but, uh,

31:32.291 --> 31:34.624
we still got today.

31:34.627 --> 31:37.127
Don't ever give up hope, ever.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.230
You gotta live by that.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.498
Honor yourself.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.367
Do not give up.

31:48.106 --> 31:49.239
TYLER: You know, it's
the last day of the season,

31:49.241 --> 31:50.774
D-bone, we're
finally in with one.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.242
DENNIS: Right on.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.376
Well, let's see what the last fish
of the season looks like for you.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.045
TYLER: Rock on.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.580
We're really looking for a real solid
price here for our final fish of the season

31:57.583 --> 31:59.316
because that'd be a
good way to, you know,

31:59.318 --> 32:01.851
cap off the season,
put a stamp on it.

32:01.854 --> 32:04.054
Even though it wasn't the season we wanted
and even though we didn't catch as many

32:04.056 --> 32:06.256
as everyone else, we
still got to go fishing.

32:07.593 --> 32:08.859
MARISSA: What's the
dress weight, Dennis?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.594
DENNIS: 415 pounds, Merm.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.163
TYLER: All right.
We're coming up, we're stoked.

32:17.869 --> 32:18.802
DENNIS: Not a bad fish.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.137
I see some nice fat
here in the minor lobes.

32:20.205 --> 32:21.204
TYLER: Ooh, nice color.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.739
DENNIS: Starting to
fan out into the majors.

32:22.741 --> 32:25.608
If this core is nice and
bright, it's gonna be a nice fish.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.344
TYLER: Perfect.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.480
DENNIS: It's not bad at all.

32:30.549 --> 32:31.748
Nice red.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.283
A little bit of opaqueness.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.018
TYLER: So, what do you think
you can get us for this one?

32:35.087 --> 32:36.520
DENNIS: Today...

32:38.156 --> 32:40.156
I'm gonna pay you $10 a pound.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.224
MARISSA: Awesome!
That's great.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.759
TYLER: Awesome. We're
happy with that, you know.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.695
After everything we've been through,
we're just happy to have another fish.

32:44.763 --> 32:45.829
Thanks, Dennis.

32:45.831 --> 32:46.847
DENNIS: Thank you, guys.

32:46.899 --> 32:47.965
Thanks for your fish this year.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.966
MARISSA: Thank you, Dennis.
Thank you.

32:49.969 --> 32:52.035
TYLER: Hey, not a
bad way to end it.

32:52.037 --> 32:53.837
Proud of us, Merm.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.841
PAUL: Starting to
see a little bait here.

32:57.909 --> 32:59.242
All right. Here we go.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.778
Look at, that's
what I like to see.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.113
This is what I like.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.181
See that?

33:04.249 --> 33:05.716
You want to see all this bait.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.050
That's what I'm looking for.

33:07.052 --> 33:08.652
That's pogies.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.922
That's what these fish are on the bottom
eating and we're gonna be right in 'em.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.792
Right now the clock is ticking,
but we're not gonna give up.

33:15.861 --> 33:19.462
We wanna seal the
deal with a huge fish.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.932
We could still take the
lead back and win this thing.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.733
My guys earned it.

33:23.736 --> 33:27.471
They put up with a lot from me so
they deserve to have the celebration.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.940
(beeping)

33:30.943 --> 33:35.011
There he is. See?
That's a tuna right there.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.547
All right.
Throw 'em out. Get 'em out.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.950
Far floater first.

33:40.953 --> 33:42.686
Get a good one.

33:42.754 --> 33:46.423
(beeping)

33:46.425 --> 33:48.358
RICK: And the
bait's coming through.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.093
PAUL: Come on, man.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.295
Give us that one last fish.

33:52.297 --> 33:54.164
(beeping)

33:54.166 --> 33:55.565
(reel unspooling rapidly)

33:55.634 --> 33:58.101
RICK: Here we go!
We're on! Woo!

33:58.103 --> 34:00.170
DOUG: Let's go get him.

34:00.705 --> 34:01.505
PAUL: Oh, yeah!

34:01.573 --> 34:03.239
(laughs)

34:03.242 --> 34:05.308
RICK: The last day
of the season.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.877
We need this fish.

34:12.734 --> 34:16.002
S that one last fish.

34:16.071 --> 34:18.138
(beeping)

34:18.140 --> 34:19.539
(reel unspooling rapidly)

34:19.541 --> 34:22.475
RICK: Here we go!
We're on! Woo!

34:22.478 --> 34:23.810
DOUG: Let's go get him.

34:23.879 --> 34:25.211
PAUL: Oh, yeah!

34:25.214 --> 34:26.213
(laughs)

34:26.281 --> 34:30.016
RICK: Got a lot
of slack line out.

34:30.018 --> 34:31.885
PAUL: He's
taking a lot of line.

34:31.887 --> 34:33.753
Yeah.

34:33.756 --> 34:36.356
RICK: This feels
like a big fish.

34:36.425 --> 34:38.291
PAUL: Reel that
(bleep) in, Rick.

34:38.360 --> 34:43.496
RICK: We're on! We're tight.
The last day of the season.

34:43.499 --> 34:45.098
We need this fish.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.767
PAUL: We got a real,
real, real, real big fish on.

34:47.770 --> 34:50.370
Just when you think
it's over, you get a bite.

34:50.706 --> 34:51.705
RICK: Taking line.

34:51.773 --> 34:53.440
PAUL: Loosen up.

34:53.442 --> 34:55.475
Loosen up!

34:57.112 --> 34:58.645
RICK: I don't see him now.

34:58.647 --> 35:00.180
PAUL: He's
right here, I see him.

35:00.248 --> 35:02.515
I see him right on top.

35:02.784 --> 35:04.050
RICK: I see color, Paul!

35:04.119 --> 35:05.185
PAUL: Yeah.

35:05.187 --> 35:06.519
RICK: Straight down.

35:06.522 --> 35:07.854
PAUL: Yeah, can
you bring him up?

35:07.923 --> 35:08.922
RICK: Not yet.

35:08.990 --> 35:10.657
DOUG: You all right, Ricky?
You want to switch?

35:10.659 --> 35:13.460
RICK: I got it down a
little backed up when he ran.

35:13.462 --> 35:17.664
DOUG: Starting
to come up here.

35:17.666 --> 35:18.998
Tight!

35:19.001 --> 35:21.868
PAUL: Good job, Dougie.
DOUG: Plenty of pressure on.

35:21.937 --> 35:24.371
PAUL: Huge, 12-foot tuna
right there, guys.

35:27.676 --> 35:28.975
PAUL: Can't I stick him?

35:31.947 --> 35:33.146
RICK: There you go.

35:35.217 --> 35:36.983
RICK: What a monster!
Let's get him in the boat.

35:37.486 --> 35:39.085
(grunts)

35:39.087 --> 35:40.753
PAUL: Oh, God.
He's taking off.

35:40.756 --> 35:42.222
RICK: Watch the line!
Watch the line.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.156
PAUL: Neutral!

35:43.158 --> 35:44.424
We got to chase him down.

35:44.426 --> 35:46.025
We don't have him yet.

35:46.028 --> 35:48.428
For ten years I've
dreamt about this moment.

35:49.097 --> 35:50.897
Just go gentle
with that dart line.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.966
If we can land this fish,

35:53.034 --> 35:54.768
everything that
we've been up against.

35:54.836 --> 35:56.303
DAVE: You've been fighting
me every step of the way.

35:56.371 --> 35:57.971
You're fired!

35:57.973 --> 35:59.372
PAUL: Tell me what's going on.

36:00.576 --> 36:01.575
(groans)

36:01.643 --> 36:04.110
PAUL: Every challenge my
crew and I have endured.

36:04.179 --> 36:06.646
Over the gunnel!
Over the gunnel!

36:06.648 --> 36:08.515
RICK: What do you mean?
All clear, Skip.

36:08.517 --> 36:10.116
PAUL: That was good teamwork.

36:10.185 --> 36:11.851
You guys rock.

36:11.854 --> 36:14.053
All the blood sweat and tears

36:14.056 --> 36:16.923
that have gone into making
this operation successful.

36:16.925 --> 36:20.060
You almost got my hand
ripped the (bleep) off!

36:20.128 --> 36:21.528
That's not cool!

36:21.596 --> 36:23.864
DOUG: Still coming up!
Go forward! Forward!

36:24.266 --> 36:26.132
MAURO: He should take a motivating
seminar or something if he's gonna be a

36:26.201 --> 36:28.668
captain because he
ain't gonna make it.

36:28.670 --> 36:30.136
PAUL: Will have been worth it.

36:30.205 --> 36:31.404
DOUG: Stick him!

36:31.406 --> 36:33.106
RICK: There you go, Paul!
DOUG: Right at the boat.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.276
(grunts)

36:38.480 --> 36:40.547
RICK: Nice. All right, watch
the rope, watch the rope.

36:40.549 --> 36:42.749
PAUL: All right.
Get a gaff! Get a gaff.

36:42.817 --> 36:44.150
RICK: Right here, Paul.
Watching the rope.

36:44.152 --> 36:48.188
PAUL: Gaff him anywhere!
Head, tail, ass, I don't care!

36:49.424 --> 36:50.690
Lift up!

36:52.827 --> 36:54.361
He is huge.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.030
We got a (bleep) 1,000 pounder.

36:58.099 --> 37:01.835
Woo! That's a (bleep)
1,000 pounder, dude.

37:01.903 --> 37:02.969
RICK: We got a grander.

37:03.038 --> 37:05.104
This is great. This is great.

37:05.107 --> 37:07.640
The biggest fish Paul and I and
Doug have ever caught in this boat.

37:07.643 --> 37:09.042
It's just so gratifying.

37:09.044 --> 37:11.177
Going out with a
bang on this boat.

37:11.179 --> 37:12.512
Last day of the season.

37:12.581 --> 37:15.248
It's like
winning the Super Bowl.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.384
DOUG: That's a big one.
That is a big one.

37:17.452 --> 37:20.253
All right, hold on. Yup.

37:20.255 --> 37:23.389
PAUL: Come on.

37:23.392 --> 37:24.925
You guys got to walk backwards.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.260
Walk, walk, walk!

37:27.329 --> 37:30.330
Told you, you got
to walk backwards.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.197
RICK: Thank God
no one got hurt.

37:31.199 --> 37:31.864
DOUG: Oh!

37:31.867 --> 37:33.399
RICK: Thank God. Woo!

37:33.402 --> 37:34.601
DOUG: Yeah!

37:34.669 --> 37:35.868
PAUL: All right you ready?

37:35.871 --> 37:37.537
DOUG: We're gonna
run out of tape.

37:37.606 --> 37:38.805
PAUL: Just like that.

37:38.873 --> 37:40.340
117.

37:40.408 --> 37:41.875
DOUG: 117.

37:41.943 --> 37:43.143
RICK: Wow!

37:43.211 --> 37:48.281
DOUG: Holy crap! Wow!
RICK: Yeah!

37:48.350 --> 37:49.415
DOUG: That's the
one right there.

37:49.418 --> 37:50.350
PAUL: Good job, that's the
biggest one of the year.

37:50.418 --> 37:51.017
RICK: Yeah, Dougie! Great job!

37:51.086 --> 37:52.552
PAUL: Nice!
RICK: Woo!

37:52.621 --> 37:54.954
(laughs)

37:54.957 --> 37:58.158
DOUG: Huge.
RICK: Huge.

37:58.226 --> 38:02.162
PAUL: Merch is gonna need a diamond
if they wanna have a shot at beating us.

38:07.902 --> 38:09.235
MARCIANO: Scotty,
what's going on, buddy?

38:09.237 --> 38:10.436
SCOTT: Last day of the season.

38:10.439 --> 38:12.372
MARCIANO: We got a
really nice 86 incher.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.840
SCOTT: Perfect.
MARCIANO: All right.

38:13.842 --> 38:15.108
ANGELICA: You ready
for the big reveal?

38:15.176 --> 38:16.710
SCOTT: Let's do it.
MARCIANO: Up, up and away.

38:16.778 --> 38:18.878
SCOTT: I can already
tell it's a nice one.

38:25.387 --> 38:26.452
MARCIANO: All right, Scotty.

38:26.455 --> 38:28.254
What do we got for
dress weight up there?

38:28.323 --> 38:30.523
SCOTT: Well, you're
looking at 267 pounds dressed.

38:30.592 --> 38:31.725
MARCIANO: Okay. Not bad.

38:31.793 --> 38:33.193
Shall we come up and
see what he looks like?

38:33.261 --> 38:35.194
SCOTT: Come on up, guys.

38:35.530 --> 38:39.799
MARCIANO: Now, if we're gonna have
any chance at all at staying ahead of Paul,

38:39.801 --> 38:43.936
we need a big
price for this fish.

38:44.139 --> 38:45.471
Okay, Scotty.

38:45.474 --> 38:46.806
SCOTT: Look at that thing.

38:46.808 --> 38:48.008
MARCIANO: That's a
nice looking fish.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.876
SCOTT: It is everything you
could expect from a fish.

38:49.878 --> 38:51.077
JASON: It's a diamond.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.412
MARCIANO: It's as close to
perfect as you can get, right?

38:52.480 --> 38:53.680
JOE: That's how
we want to end it.

38:53.682 --> 38:55.749
MARCIANO: Let's see
what this core looks like.

38:56.018 --> 38:57.083
JASON: Dime!

38:57.085 --> 38:58.284
SCOTT: Ooh. That's perfect.

38:58.353 --> 38:59.419
JOE: No yaki there.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.554
SCOTT: Loaded with fat.
Very greasy fish.

39:01.623 --> 39:03.089
JOE: Yeah.

39:03.091 --> 39:06.092
MARCIANO: What can you do so we
can have a shot at winning this thing?

39:06.495 --> 39:09.562
SCOTT: Bottom line...

39:13.768 --> 39:16.269
♪ ♪

39:22.694 --> 39:24.560
ice looking fish.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.697
SCOTT: It is everything
you could expect from a fish.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.667
MARCIANO: What can you do so we
can have a shot at winning this thing?

39:31.503 --> 39:33.169
SCOTT: Bottom line...

39:39.177 --> 39:40.977
$15 a pound.

39:41.045 --> 39:41.778
MARCIANO: All right.
ANGELICA: Awesome.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.712
MARCIANO: We'll take it, man.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.647
Well done, team.
Way to end a great season.

39:44.649 --> 39:46.115
JOE: Finish up
the season strong.

39:46.118 --> 39:48.351
MARCIANO: Now all we gotta do is
wait and see what happens with Paul.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.053
Thank you again, Scotty.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.387
JOE: See you
next year, Scotty.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.055
SCOTT: Bye, guys.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.124
MARCIANO: All right.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.725
We've done the best we
can do this year, team.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.001
PAUL: Want me to do another
circle for the victory?

40:05.003 --> 40:05.802
RICK: Yeah.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.136
(laughter)

40:07.139 --> 40:08.871
PATRICK: Hey, Paul,
big boy, huh?

40:08.874 --> 40:09.939
Sea monster?

40:09.941 --> 40:11.224
DOUG: 117.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.009
PATRICK: Way to go.
Congratulations!

40:13.011 --> 40:14.410
PAUL: Thank you.
PATRICK: All right, guys.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.746
Let's get it up and
see what she looks like.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.882
PAUL: We feel
really overwhelmed.

40:18.950 --> 40:25.221
To end this year with a 117 inch
fish was just beyond my imagination.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.024
But we never gave up.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.759
What do you got for a
weight on this one, PJ?

40:29.761 --> 40:31.711
PATRICK: 622 pounds dressed.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.096
PAUL: Dude, the last fish!
RICK: Yeah. Nice.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.097
PATRICK: Way to go, boys.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.299
PAUL: Let's see what we
can for money for this.

40:36.301 --> 40:37.366
What do you think?

40:37.369 --> 40:39.235
PATRICK: Let's do it.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.845
Check it out.

40:48.913 --> 40:51.581
It's a beautiful color fish and
that's pretty much about it.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.715
RICK: Yes.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.383
PATRICK: It
doesn't have any fat.

40:54.386 --> 40:56.386
PAUL: 620 something
pounds dressed.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.321
What can you get
us for this fish?

40:58.323 --> 41:00.323
PATRICK: This one here...

41:04.462 --> 41:06.128
I can get you $8 a pound, Paul.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.598
PAUL: Dude, that is awesome!

41:08.666 --> 41:09.799
You too, pal.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.934
RICK: Yay Dougie!
PATRICK: Way to go guys.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.136
PAUL: Easy on the back, easy.

41:13.204 --> 41:16.072
Today was just like a dream.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.007
The little boat
that could, right?

41:18.009 --> 41:19.409
PATRICK: What a
season you guys had.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.743
PAUL: And you guys deserve it.

41:20.745 --> 41:23.679
I'm so happy for you guys.
You guys have worked so hard.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.215
And thank you, PJ,
for all your prices.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.683
PATRICK: All right,
congratulations, guys.

41:26.751 --> 41:28.151
RICK: All right, brother.
Thanks, PJ!

41:28.219 --> 41:29.418
PAUL: See you soon.
RICK: Take care, guys.

41:29.421 --> 41:30.086
PAUL: We did it.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.954
Now the boat's gonna retire.

41:31.957 --> 41:34.891
It's gonna have a new buyer and my
new boat will be here in four weeks.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.262
Wait until next year,
there will be no stopping us.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.499
<i>NARRATOR: In the
last day of fishing</i>

41:47.489 --> 41:49.839

41:59.183 --> 42:02.318
MARCIANO: All right, well,
congratulations to Paul.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.921
I mean, the world was a
scary place this year, right?

42:04.923 --> 42:07.323
We didn't even know if we
were gonna have a season.

42:07.392 --> 42:10.660
So to wind up as one of
the top two boats, you know,

42:10.728 --> 42:12.194
we should be very proud of that.

42:12.197 --> 42:13.997
JASON: We could taste
the victory this year.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.531
MARCIANO: Yep.
JASON: We're gunning for them.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.000
MARCIANO: We'll be
gunning for them next year.

42:17.068 --> 42:18.601
I'm very proud of you guys.

42:18.603 --> 42:21.270
DAVE: That's it. Wrapped up.
Good season though.

42:21.273 --> 42:22.472
GEORDIE: Yeah.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.740
SANDRO: It was good
for what it was, you know.

42:23.808 --> 42:24.607
GEORDIE: Take it as it comes.

42:24.676 --> 42:25.408
Next year will be
better hopefully.

42:25.410 --> 42:26.542
DAVE: Yeah.

42:26.545 --> 42:29.145
BOB: Well, boys, still
made income for our families.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.413
MANNY: We did what we could.

42:30.481 --> 42:31.481
Let's go after 2021.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.749
BOB: Yup.
Proud of this year, bros.

42:32.817 --> 42:33.883
MANNY: That's it, my man.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.217
TYLER: Well, it was
definitely a tough season.

42:35.220 --> 42:36.686
It was brutal but we somehow
managed to salvage the year.

42:36.754 --> 42:38.754
MARISSA: Made it work in the
end and that's all that matters.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.024
Hopefully we'll have a
better season next year.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.492
JARRETT: All right, buddy,
so that's a wrap, huh?

42:43.495 --> 42:44.494
TJ: It's over, bro.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.695
JARRETT: It's a good year.

42:45.697 --> 42:47.230
TJ: We didn't
repeat as champs though.

42:47.298 --> 42:49.165
JARRETT: I think when it's all said
and done, man, we fished our asses off.

42:49.233 --> 42:52.902
JACK: Well, no one can say we
didn't give 110% out there every trip.

42:52.971 --> 42:53.903
NICHOLAS: Yeah. Absolutely.

42:53.972 --> 42:55.438
Spending days
and nights out here.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.839
JACK: Definitely proved that,

42:56.908 --> 42:59.275
you know, we could go out there
and hang with the rest of them.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.379
PAUL: Dude, we
did it this year!

43:03.381 --> 43:04.581
RICK: Yeah!

43:04.649 --> 43:06.049
PAUL: Yeah, you guys did it.

43:06.117 --> 43:07.650
RICK: You know it.
Dougie, nice job.

43:07.719 --> 43:09.319
Great team effort.

43:09.387 --> 43:11.854
PAUL: We beat
these guys in this boat.

43:11.856 --> 43:14.958
RICK: You know, it's only fitting,
the last season of this old girl,

43:14.976 --> 43:16.459
who was so good to you.

43:16.461 --> 43:17.994
PAUL: She's done
very good to us.

43:17.996 --> 43:19.595
RICK: Fat lady sang,
that's for sure.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.197
PAUL: You guys have
a lot to be proud of,

43:21.265 --> 43:23.132
you guys really put
in a lot of good time.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.534
RICK: Thanks captain,
thanks that means a lot.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.935
Look who it is.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.203
MARCIANO: How
are we doing, boys?

43:27.205 --> 43:28.204
PAUL: Hey, Cap!
Good job my, friend.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.405
MARCIANO: You
as well, man, you as well.

43:29.407 --> 43:30.673
PAUL: That was great.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.141
MARCIANO: Come on give me a
hug, never mind that handshake.

43:32.143 --> 43:33.676
Congratulations, Paulie.

43:33.678 --> 43:35.211
Congratulations.

43:35.279 --> 43:38.815
You know, in season four, a trophy
was given to me for winning that season

43:38.883 --> 43:40.416
on the Hard Merch.

43:40.418 --> 43:43.219
You know what, you guys
earned the win this year,

43:43.221 --> 43:47.824
so I wanna give you the trophy
that I've had as a champion,

43:47.892 --> 43:50.092
form one champion
to the other, Paul.

43:50.095 --> 43:51.894
You are now the
champions of season ten.

43:51.896 --> 43:53.363
Well done, boys. Well done.

43:53.431 --> 43:55.364
PAUL: Thanks, Dave.
Who did that engraving?

43:55.367 --> 43:57.367
MARCIANO: Well, I failed
penmanship in high school

43:57.435 --> 43:59.502
along with a lot
of other subjects.

43:59.504 --> 44:01.103
PAUL: How about that, guys?

44:01.106 --> 44:02.505
RICK: Nice.
DOUG: It's very nice.

44:02.573 --> 44:04.106
MARCIANO: You guys
earned it fair and square.

44:04.109 --> 44:05.842
Next season we're
coming for the trophy.

44:05.910 --> 44:07.243
DOUG: All right.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.978
MARCIANO: All right, boys,
congratulations on an awesome year.

44:09.047 --> 44:10.179
ALL: Thanks, Dave.

44:10.248 --> 44:12.115
PAUL: Good going.
You too, man.

44:12.183 --> 44:14.917
Let's go super glue it to the
dash so Dave can't get it back.

44:14.919 --> 44:16.519
DOUG: Bolt it.

44:16.587 --> 44:17.920
RICK: Better
than Velcroing it.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.088
PAUL: Super glue
it right there.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.256
RICK: Nice.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.124
