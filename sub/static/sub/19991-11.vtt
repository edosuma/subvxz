Hey, kiddies!

01:02.530 --> 01:03.896
It's your old pal, Patchy,

01:03.964 --> 01:05.731
floating somewhere
over Bikini Bottom.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.699
I sailed down here
to witness something

01:07.768 --> 01:10.002
that only happens
every 100 years.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.704
Why, me and my trusted parrot,
Potty, wouldn't miss it

01:12.773 --> 01:15.240
for the world,
would we, Potty?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.942
Potty?

01:17.011 --> 01:18.077
Rah!

01:18.145 --> 01:19.812
I'm just here for the buffet.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.481
Oh, Potty!

01:24.385 --> 01:26.351
Give me that!

01:29.423 --> 01:31.757
Potty, I told you
to leave those fish alone!

01:31.826 --> 01:34.827
What do you think you are,
a seahawk?

01:36.397 --> 01:38.497
I can't help it
if I was born a predator.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.032
Rah!
- Oh, Potty.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.300
I guess you're right.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.035
Can you ever forgive me?

01:43.104 --> 01:44.770
Shake.

01:44.839 --> 01:45.771
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:45.840 --> 01:47.840
Now I can.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.241
Rah!

01:49.310 --> 01:51.210
Oh, get out of here!

01:53.380 --> 01:55.147
Yep!

01:55.216 --> 01:57.015
Whoosh!

02:00.121 --> 02:01.520

02:19.740 --> 02:22.541

could ever have.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.009
- Cake time!

02:24.078 --> 02:25.344
Wah!

02:33.287 --> 02:34.553
- Don't worry.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.355
I always carry a spare.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.759
- Oh, no you don't!

02:40.828 --> 02:42.094
Hoo-hah!

02:42.163 --> 02:43.562
Karate slice! Hi-yah!

02:48.903 --> 02:50.435
- Enjoy the cake, everybody.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.237
I made it special
just for Sandy.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.475
Mmm.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.177
- I'm allergic to nuts.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.578
Are there any nuts in that?

02:59.647 --> 03:01.780
- Nope, no nuts.
- Oh, okay.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.249
- Oh, unless
you count "wall nuts".

03:04.318 --> 03:05.751
- What...

03:05.819 --> 03:08.187
- I'm pretty sure walnuts
are a fruit though, huh?

03:12.193 --> 03:13.292
- Mmm!

03:13.360 --> 03:15.961
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!

03:19.633 --> 03:21.800
Huh? Whoa!

03:21.869 --> 03:23.602
- Whoa!

03:25.206 --> 03:26.738
Tex Ritter!

03:26.807 --> 03:28.507
You don't see that everyday.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.911
Huh?

03:32.980 --> 03:35.714
Ooh! Pretty!

03:35.783 --> 03:37.716
Last time I saw a moon
that big,

03:37.785 --> 03:39.851
it was in a locker room.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.920
- Since when is the moon
so green?

03:43.591 --> 03:47.092
Everyone knows the moon
is made of cheese, SpongeBob.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.494
It's just been up there so long,

03:49.563 --> 03:50.996
it's getting moldy.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.465
Oh, but I'd still eat it.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.835
- That ain't the moon, guys.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.738
The real moon comes out
at night, remember?

03:59.807 --> 04:02.074
Something fishy's
going on here.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.610
- Attagirl, Sissy.
- I got it!

04:04.678 --> 04:06.111
- Look out, Mom!
- Hey, kids,

04:06.180 --> 04:09.348
check out that cool,
glowing rock in the sky.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.891
- You don't see that every day.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.493
Did you see that, SpongeBob?

04:21.562 --> 04:23.362
Sponge... Bob?

04:29.403 --> 04:32.371
Huh?

04:37.411 --> 04:39.544
Green cheese, green cheese!

04:39.613 --> 04:41.079
Green cheese!

04:43.450 --> 04:45.417
- SpongeBob? Patrick?

04:50.557 --> 04:51.690
Everyone, listen to me!

04:51.759 --> 04:53.325
Get away from the light!

04:53.394 --> 04:55.594
The light is bad!

04:55.663 --> 04:58.096
Run for the shade!

04:58.165 --> 05:00.866
- So romantic.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.200
- Oh-ho!

05:02.269 --> 05:04.202
- Eugene-ikins,

05:04.271 --> 05:06.705
give me some sugar.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.241
- I'm always a sucker
for a good smooch.

Advertise your product or brand here

05:18.385 --> 05:22.254
- Yeah, walk outside and
check out this awesome moon.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.825
Agh!

05:26.894 --> 05:30.262
<i>- Hello? Hello, Pearl?</i>

05:43.377 --> 05:45.010
- No! Not me!

05:47.481 --> 05:48.847
Huh?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.749
I guess it only effects
sea critters,

05:50.818 --> 05:53.285
but I still don't get why
that green moon

05:53.354 --> 05:56.355
is turning everyone
into wild swimming fish?

05:57.725 --> 06:00.225
Am I the only one left?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.564
- Oh, whoever used
that restroom last

06:05.632 --> 06:07.766
was an animal!

06:09.837 --> 06:11.636
- Hey, put me down!

06:11.705 --> 06:13.305
Sandy!
What are you doing?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.173
Ow! That hurts!

06:17.711 --> 06:19.778
What is the meaning of...

06:19.847 --> 06:21.313
- Get in the shade!

06:23.317 --> 06:24.983
- I demand an explanation!

06:25.052 --> 06:27.185
- I'm getting one
right now, Squidward!

06:33.060 --> 06:35.193
Hello?
French Narrator speaking.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.328
<i>- Hey, Frenchy!</i>

06:36.397 --> 06:37.462
<i>It's me, Sandy!</i>

06:37.531 --> 06:38.864
- Ah, Sandy Cheeks.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.532
How is it hanging?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.701
<i>- Oh, it's not hanging
too good, Frenchy.</i>

06:42.770 --> 06:44.803
<i>You see, there's this...</i>
- Don't say another word.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.805
I have been monitoring
the behavior

06:46.874 --> 06:48.774
of the green moon all day.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.143
It is called Neptune's Moon.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.677
Every 100 years,

06:52.746 --> 06:55.013
it de-evolves everyone
in Bikini Bottom

06:55.082 --> 06:57.182
into primal fish for two hours.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.717
- Two hours?

06:58.786 --> 07:00.919
- Until it falls
into another volcano

07:00.988 --> 07:03.722
and is extinguished.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.690
- I knewed it was nature,
dagnabit!

07:05.759 --> 07:07.292
That's a relief.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.361
So I just have to keep Squidward
in the shade

07:09.430 --> 07:10.462
for a couple of hours.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.168
Phew!

07:16.236 --> 07:17.235
Thanks, Frenchy.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.540
I'm going home to hide
under the covers!

07:21.608 --> 07:23.742
It's every cephalopod
for himself!

07:25.045 --> 07:26.878
Frenchy, I gotta call you back!

07:26.947 --> 07:30.081
Squidward,
you have to stay in the shade!

07:31.752 --> 07:34.386
Help!

07:34.455 --> 07:36.521
- Squidward! No!

07:42.896 --> 07:44.963
- O.M. Jehoshaphat!

07:45.032 --> 07:46.498
You don't see that everyday.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.236
My friends are gonna be lunch
if I don't think fast!

07:56.844 --> 07:58.710
SpongeBob! Patrick!

08:00.781 --> 08:01.847
Mrs. Puff!

08:01.915 --> 08:03.048
Mr. Krabs!

08:03.116 --> 08:04.115
Larry!

08:05.586 --> 08:07.252
Yeeouch!

08:08.722 --> 08:10.188
Look out, Pearl!

08:10.257 --> 08:12.190
I'll save you!

08:12.259 --> 08:13.425
Yee-ha!

08:16.897 --> 08:18.697
Like busting a bronco!

08:18.765 --> 08:20.332
Yee-ha!

08:25.706 --> 08:27.639
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

08:31.545 --> 08:34.446
Not the blowhole!

08:56.870 --> 08:58.670
Hey! Everybody!

08:58.739 --> 09:00.605
The light is bad!

09:00.674 --> 09:02.407
Stay away from the light!

09:02.476 --> 09:04.609
- License and registration,
please?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.656
Hold your breath, critters.

09:18.725 --> 09:19.958
- Uh-oh!

09:22.596 --> 09:24.396
Whale!

09:24.464 --> 09:26.665
Stroke! Stroke!

09:26.733 --> 09:27.999
Stroke!

09:34.942 --> 09:36.408
Oh! Oh, Potty!

09:36.476 --> 09:38.410
We're taking on water!

09:40.247 --> 09:42.414
A little help here,
please, Potty?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.216
Oh!

09:45.285 --> 09:48.086
Get out of here,
you fiendish feather duster!

09:48.155 --> 09:50.689
Shoo! Shoo! I said, shoo!

09:50.757 --> 09:51.957
I'll do it meself.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.525
I don't need your help.

09:53.594 --> 09:57.228
I'm perfectly fine
doing it by meself.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.000
Here's where we get off.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.938
Thanks for the lift, Pearl!

10:07.007 --> 10:08.473
Don't you worry.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.675
Nobody's going to eat you guys
on my watch.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.243
Ow!

10:13.981 --> 10:15.947
Dinner time!
Come and get it!

10:21.088 --> 10:23.355
- This is so fascinating,
Frenchy.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.990
Tell me more about
my fishy friends.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.126
Oh, wait.
I'll put you on speaker phone.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.161
<i>- Ah, the lobster.</i>

10:30.230 --> 10:31.796
<i>The cockroach of the sea.</i>

10:31.865 --> 10:33.632
<i>Skittering across
the ocean floor,</i>

10:33.700 --> 10:36.735
<i>the lobster sheds its skin
once a week...</i>

10:40.140 --> 10:44.009
<i>And then eats it.</i>

10:44.077 --> 10:46.411
- Now that's what I call
recycling, huh, Frenchy?

10:46.480 --> 10:50.548
<i>- Ah, notice the scavenger crab
eating garbage</i>

10:50.617 --> 10:54.319
<i>unaware he is being stalked
by his natural predator,</i>

10:54.388 --> 10:57.155
<i>the puffer fish.</i>

10:57.224 --> 10:59.491
Oh, no, you don't.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.226
- Ow!

11:01.294 --> 11:04.429
- I knew I was gonna have
to separate you two.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.966
You're welcome, Mr. Krabs

11:09.302 --> 11:11.469
Ouch!

11:11.538 --> 11:14.572
Yeowch!

11:16.276 --> 11:19.277
<i>- Ah, observe how
the hungry sea star</i>

11:19.346 --> 11:22.480
<i>ejects his own stomach
from his body</i>

11:22.549 --> 11:24.449
<i>in order to eat his meal</i>

11:24.518 --> 11:27.986
<i>where the primitive sea sponge
filters nutrients</i>

11:28.055 --> 11:30.822
<i>and oxygen from bacteria
particles.</i>

11:35.262 --> 11:38.697
SpongeBob is never
gonna believe this.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.634
<i>- Ah, the giant octopus.</i>

11:42.703 --> 11:45.470
<i>One of the largest predators
on the ocean floor.</i>

11:45.539 --> 11:48.406
- Texas toast!
It's a good thing my tree dome

11:48.475 --> 11:50.341
is made of ten tons
of pressure proof glass,

11:50.410 --> 11:52.744
huh, Frenchy?
<i>- Oui, Sandy, that is true,</i>

11:52.813 --> 11:54.846
<i>but, unfortunately,
the poisonous</i>

11:54.915 --> 11:58.149
<i>and highly intelligent octopus
can also cut through</i>

11:58.218 --> 12:00.385
<i>hard bedrock with its beak.</i>

12:04.391 --> 12:06.958
- You don't
see that everyday!

12:07.027 --> 12:09.828
Squidward, no!

12:25.378 --> 12:27.912
Whoa!

12:27.981 --> 12:30.815
Ooh!

12:35.956 --> 12:37.255
- Hi-yah!

12:37.324 --> 12:40.658
Aah, hominy grits!

12:42.729 --> 12:45.764
<i>- Ah, the battle
for the survival of the fittest</i>

12:45.832 --> 12:47.999
<i>rages on in the animal kingdom.</i>

12:48.068 --> 12:51.169
- My friends!
My tree!

12:51.238 --> 12:53.371
<i>- Sandy, you must remember,</i>

12:53.440 --> 12:56.875
<i>who is the natural enemy
of the octopus?</i>

12:56.943 --> 13:00.078
- That's a great idea.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.680
<i>- Using her versatile tail,</i>

13:02.749 --> 13:05.049
<i>the Texas land squirrel
calls out</i>

13:05.118 --> 13:07.886
<i>to the natural enemy
of the octopus.</i>

13:07.954 --> 13:09.954
- There she blows, y'all!

13:10.023 --> 13:12.524
<i>The whale.</i>

13:12.592 --> 13:15.894
- Sick 'em, Pearl!
Sorry, Squidward!

13:25.972 --> 13:27.672
Ooh! Ohh!

13:30.744 --> 13:33.478
Oh! Two hours is up?

13:33.547 --> 13:35.046
Thank goodness.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.483
<i>- And so we bid a fond adieu
to Neptune's moon</i>

13:38.552 --> 13:42.620
<i>as it descends back into
the Earth from whence it came.</i>

13:42.689 --> 13:45.223
<i>We will see it again
in 100 years.</i>

13:45.292 --> 13:48.660
Goal!

14:06.947 --> 14:09.147
What is going on here?

14:09.216 --> 14:10.515
My clothes!

14:16.723 --> 14:18.089
- Aah!

14:24.631 --> 14:27.165
- Um, Sandy, how come
your tree dome is broken

14:27.234 --> 14:29.000
and everyone's naked?
- Well, SpongeBob,

14:29.069 --> 14:31.636
let's just say this has been
the most interesting birthday

14:31.705 --> 14:34.305
I ever had.
<i>- And, of course,</i>

14:34.374 --> 14:37.208
<i>Neptune's moon
is always followed by</i>

14:37.277 --> 14:40.511
<i>Neptune's sun.</i>

14:51.658 --> 14:54.926
You don't see that everyday.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.095
Jinx!
Buy me a patty!

15:01.268 --> 15:03.668
<i>- Ah, Bikini Bottom.</i>

15:03.737 --> 15:07.105
<i>Teaming with life
and naked mysteries.</i>

15:07.173 --> 15:08.940
<i>This next whale song
is going out</i>

15:09.009 --> 15:12.877
<i>to my favorite squirrel.
Sandy, happy birthday.</i>

15:12.946 --> 15:16.114
- Yee haw!

15:16.182 --> 15:18.383
Whoo!
- Ooh, Potty,

15:18.451 --> 15:20.485
I never thought it'd end up
like this,

15:20.553 --> 15:23.621
brunch for a shark.
- I guess this is it.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.256
Good-bye, Patchy.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.760
- Good-bye, Potty.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.434
Huh?
- Hello!

15:36.503 --> 15:38.870
- Frenchy, you surprising
scallywag!

15:38.939 --> 15:40.538
Get... What are you doing here?

15:40.607 --> 15:44.609
- Ah, Patchy the pirate,
I just swam back to warn you

15:44.678 --> 15:47.712
about Neptune's sun,
but it's too late.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.781
<i>Au revoir.</i>

15:49.849 --> 15:52.250
- Bye.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.786
Neptune's sun?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.658
What's happening?!

16:18.111 --> 16:20.778
Mm, yummy.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.664
Oops.
Doink.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.973
I don't remember
leaving the fridge open.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.443
Huh?

17:26.546 --> 17:30.748
Huh, I don't remember
making such a mess.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.818
And I'm pretty sure
I didn't eat spaghetti.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.988
Nope.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.022
Huh?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.873
Oh, hey, Patrick.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.544
Wake up, Patrick!

18:00.413 --> 18:03.548
Whoa!

18:20.066 --> 18:21.632
Whoa!

18:56.136 --> 18:59.170
Aah!

19:14.187 --> 19:18.055
- Aah!

19:20.493 --> 19:23.694
Aah!

19:46.119 --> 19:50.121
Aah!
Whew.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.607
- Shh! Shhh!

20:14.814 --> 20:17.215
- Uh-huh.
Phew.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.449
<i>- What the...?</i>

20:18.518 --> 20:21.485
- Aah!

20:21.554 --> 20:25.223
Ooh!
Ow!

20:32.265 --> 20:35.132
Blech!
Ow!

20:44.277 --> 20:46.811
Mm.
Ahh...

20:46.879 --> 20:48.512
- No, Patrick, no!

20:48.581 --> 20:51.816
Don't!

21:08.334 --> 21:10.101
Huh?
Aah!

21:26.085 --> 21:28.352
Ohh!

21:41.901 --> 21:44.635
Whoa!

21:48.875 --> 21:51.742
- Breezy.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.105
- Ow!

22:21.174 --> 22:25.076
Oh, brother.

22:27.647 --> 22:28.579
Oh!

22:31.317 --> 22:33.751
Oh, he'll be fine.
