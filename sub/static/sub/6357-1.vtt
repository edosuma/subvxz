00:33.314 --> 00:35.009
Five...

00:35.082 --> 00:37.414
nine, ten, eleven...

00:37.485 --> 00:39.385
twelve, thirteen,
nineteen, seventeen...

00:39.500 --> 00:41.500
Arnie, eat some chicken.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.400
I don't want any chicken, Gilbert.

00:46.627 --> 00:49.027
You want some corn?

00:49.100 --> 00:52.100
- I want some corn.
- Have some corn.

00:57.905 --> 00:59.338
Good?

01:01.609 --> 01:03.201
Not good corn.

01:07.681 --> 01:09.876
Gilbert...

01:09.950 --> 01:11.474
are they gonna come soon?

01:11.552 --> 01:14.544
'Cause I gotta go back home,
you know?

01:14.622 --> 01:16.249
Pretty soon.

01:16.323 --> 01:18.257
I want them to come.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.558
- You wanna go home?
- No.

01:22.630 --> 01:24.564
I wanna see 'em.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.400
They're gonna come soon, huh?

01:30.070 --> 01:32.197
How many more miles
till they come, Gilbert?

01:32.273 --> 01:33.900
- Three million, buddy.
- Three?

01:33.974 --> 01:35.601
- Yep.
- Okay.

01:44.985 --> 01:47.818
That's them, huh?
Look, it's them!

01:48.956 --> 01:51.254
Look! Look over there!

02:01.200 --> 02:04.300
Look at them, Gilbert!
They're coming!

02:08.008 --> 02:10.636
Honk your horn!
Honk your horn!

02:14.315 --> 02:16.681
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 18.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.200
My family's planning
a big party for him.

02:21.500 --> 02:25.000
Watching the campers
is our yearly ritual.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.600
They're doing the right thing
just passing through.

02:32.166 --> 02:34.225
God, Arnie.
You're gettin' so big.

02:34.301 --> 02:37.464
Pretty soon, I ain't gonna
be able to carry you no more.

02:37.538 --> 02:40.632
You know,
you're getting littler, Gilbert.

02:40.708 --> 02:43.336
You're getting littler.
You're shrinking.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.700
You're shrinking, Gilbert.

02:59.526 --> 03:01.255
Endora.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.300
Endora's where we are.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.400
Describing Endora
is like dancing to no music.

03:09.303 --> 03:12.204
It's a town where
nothing much ever happens...

03:12.273 --> 03:14.673
and nothing much ever will.

03:16.677 --> 03:19.669
Lamson's Grocery is where I work.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.900
And miles out of town on
the interstate, there's Foodland...

03:24.084 --> 03:26.279
where everyone else shops.

03:27.721 --> 03:29.746
This is where I live
with my family.

03:29.900 --> 03:35.100
My dad built the house, and it's
my job to keep up the repairs.

03:37.031 --> 03:40.228
Doctors said we'd be lucky
if Arnie lived to be ten.

03:40.301 --> 03:42.963
Well, ten came and went.
Now the doctors are saying...

03:43.100 --> 03:46.500
"Any time now.
Arnie can go at any time."

03:58.385 --> 04:01.786
- Some days you want him to live...
- The head.

04:01.855 --> 04:03.447
...some days you don't.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.600
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.

04:10.597 --> 04:13.623
- I killed him, Gilbert.
- I know.

04:13.701 --> 04:15.396
I know, buddy.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.000
My older sister Amy's
more like a mother.

04:25.279 --> 04:29.181
She used to manage the elementary
school cafeteria over in Motley...

04:29.300 --> 04:31.900
until it burned down last year.

04:34.088 --> 04:36.079
My other sister, Ellen,
just turned 15.

04:36.156 --> 04:40.149
She got her braces off, and she's
been walking around going "Ooh, ah."

04:40.300 --> 04:43.700
Like she can't believe
the feel of teeth.

04:50.237 --> 04:53.604
I got another brother, Larry,
but he got away.

04:53.674 --> 04:55.938
And then there's Mama,
who in her day...

04:56.010 --> 04:58.376
was the prettiest girl
in these parts.

04:58.445 --> 05:01.437
Ever since our dad
was hung out to dry 17 years ago...

05:01.515 --> 05:03.380
Mama's had her hands full.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.700
You see, with Mama there's
no nice way to break it to you.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.600
She hasn't left the house
in over seven years.

05:13.761 --> 05:16.025
- I'm Gilbert.
- Ellen, I need your help.

05:16.096 --> 05:19.190
- What is it?
- Gilbert Grape.

05:22.770 --> 05:25.967
Sunshine? Where's my sunshine?

05:26.040 --> 05:28.031
I don't know, Mama.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.700
- Just the essentials.
- Okay.

05:34.081 --> 05:37.141
Gilbert, get him down from there.

05:38.852 --> 05:40.979
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

05:42.256 --> 05:45.987
- Amy, have you seen Arnie?
- No.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.300
I thought he was with you.

05:49.663 --> 05:51.995
I wonder where he is.

05:52.066 --> 05:53.897
Gee, I don't know.

05:53.967 --> 05:55.901
Ellen, have you seen your brother?

05:55.969 --> 05:58.802
He's in the tree.

05:58.872 --> 06:02.239
He is not in the tree.
Gilbert already looked in the tree.

06:02.309 --> 06:05.176
Isn't that right, Gilbert?

06:05.245 --> 06:06.837
Yeah, that's right.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.500
Don't do that. You scared me.
Come here.

06:16.990 --> 06:19.049
- I was up there!
- Yeah, you were up in the tree.

06:19.126 --> 06:21.060
I was right up there.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.300
Can I help you with anything?

07:15.448 --> 07:17.507
Thank you, and good-bye.

07:21.554 --> 07:23.215
- Gilbert?
- Sir?

07:23.290 --> 07:25.554
Is something goin' on at Foodland?

07:25.625 --> 07:30.085
I wouldn't know, sir.
I don't shop there. I'd rather die.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.800
I'll tell you, Foodland's
up to something if you ask me.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.300
It's those lobsters, isn't it?

07:42.575 --> 07:45.442
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.

07:45.512 --> 07:47.207
Am I right?

07:47.280 --> 07:50.408
You know,
you shouldn't worry about it.

07:50.483 --> 07:54.078
It's just a phase. People
will come back here, believe me.

07:54.154 --> 07:56.145
- You think?
- Oh, yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.200
The way you say that makes me think
I'm talking to your father.

08:10.170 --> 08:12.400
- Can I have these two?
- No, just one.

08:12.472 --> 08:14.406
- Can I have these two?
- Sure, go ahead.

08:14.474 --> 08:16.305
Say "Thank you."

08:16.376 --> 08:18.657
- Say hello to Mama for me.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

08:18.712 --> 08:22.113
Gilbert? That was Mrs. Carver
needing a delivery.

08:22.182 --> 08:24.878
Could you?

08:32.792 --> 08:34.623
Boys, go on outside.

08:34.693 --> 08:37.663
- But we don't want to.
- Yeah, we don't want to.

08:37.731 --> 08:38.924
Go play.

08:45.472 --> 08:48.168
Get back in the truck.
Keep countin', okay?

08:48.241 --> 08:52.234
Okay. I was counting.

09:17.300 --> 09:22.800
Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

09:30.116 --> 09:31.481
Hey, kids, let's play!

09:31.551 --> 09:33.985
Come on!

09:34.053 --> 09:37.955
We got the trampoline.
Come on, boys. It's fun!

09:42.362 --> 09:44.592
The ice cream's gonna melt...

09:44.664 --> 09:46.097
soon.

09:49.135 --> 09:52.627
You're right.
It is melting.

10:27.307 --> 10:29.275
Oh, my God!

10:32.879 --> 10:35.746
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my God.

10:38.952 --> 10:41.614
- Come on up. I wanna show you.
- I don't wanna do it.

10:41.700 --> 10:45.100
- You don't wanna do it?
- I want a pool.

10:45.792 --> 10:48.226
- You want a pool?
- Yeah, we want a pool.

10:48.294 --> 10:50.626
Come on up.
Up, up, up, up.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.900
Gilbert was just making a delivery.

11:05.778 --> 11:09.043
Gilbert, come here for a second.

11:17.257 --> 11:20.317
- Here.
- Oh, no, really.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.600
Oh, no, here.
I insist. You deserve it.

11:26.366 --> 11:27.765
Thank you.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.200
- Thank you.
- Bye, Gilbert.

11:32.872 --> 11:35.534
Come by my office.

11:35.608 --> 11:37.508
We need to talk.

11:56.663 --> 12:00.064
Okay, son, it's a little dangerous
up there. Come on down.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.600
Arnie, get down!

12:01.668 --> 12:03.602
Come on, son.
We've had enough fun for one day.

12:03.670 --> 12:05.262
Come on down.

12:13.179 --> 12:16.080
- Son?
- Yeah?

12:16.149 --> 12:19.016
- Come on down.
- No!

12:19.100 --> 12:22.400
I'm not coming down!
I'm goin' up there!

12:22.555 --> 12:25.285
Son, come on down.

12:25.358 --> 12:27.292
I'm gonna go up there!

12:29.696 --> 12:32.688
- Come on down, buddy.
- Look up here.

12:32.765 --> 12:34.630
Hi!

12:36.202 --> 12:38.602
Okay, son.
Come on down.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.800
I'm gonna go up here!

12:42.275 --> 12:43.435
Come on, son.

12:43.509 --> 12:46.910
I'm goin' higher than before!

12:46.980 --> 12:48.345
I'm goin' high!

12:48.414 --> 12:52.009
It's gonna be getting dark soon.
Come on down.

12:52.085 --> 12:54.679
Hey, Bob.
Yeah, here we go again.

12:54.754 --> 12:57.780
Basically, I don't like
to work on carburetors...

12:57.857 --> 12:59.950
and I can tell
without gettin' into it...

13:00.026 --> 13:03.154
that that is a complicated unit.

13:03.229 --> 13:07.393
I understand. I can do it myself,
but I need the part.

13:07.467 --> 13:09.332
Look, let me show you.

13:09.402 --> 13:11.734
See, it's this
little guy right here.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.100
The needle valve is worn down.

13:14.273 --> 13:16.867
I need a new one.
Can we order it?

13:16.942 --> 13:18.409
Yes, ma'am.

13:18.477 --> 13:22.277
- I can order it.
- How long will that take?

13:22.348 --> 13:25.112
- Probably a week.
- A week?

13:25.184 --> 13:26.947
Don't make us come get you.

13:27.100 --> 13:31.100
You don't have to come get me!
I'm goin' up here!

13:35.127 --> 13:37.288
I'm not gonna fall!

13:44.803 --> 13:46.737
My shoe done fell off.

13:53.646 --> 13:56.774
I know a boy whose name is Arnie.

13:56.849 --> 14:00.910
He's about to turn 18
and have a big party

14:01.000 --> 14:03.800
I know a boy whose name is Arnie.

14:06.592 --> 14:09.152
Come on down, buddy.
Come on.

14:15.968 --> 14:18.732
Match in the gas tank Boom, boom.

14:39.325 --> 14:43.125
Good boy.
Come on down, buddy.

14:57.710 --> 15:00.679
Here we go. Thanks a lot, Jerry.
Really sorry.

15:00.746 --> 15:03.579
Good boy. Good boy.

15:03.649 --> 15:06.812
I'm gonna take him home.
I promise it won't happen again.

15:06.885 --> 15:09.649
We hear this every time.
Then after a couple of days...

15:09.722 --> 15:11.656
he's right back up there again.

15:11.724 --> 15:14.852
But this is the last time.
Right, buddy?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.400
- It's the last time.
- Yeah.

15:18.300 --> 15:22.800
- Come on. Let's go.
- I wanna go back up there again.

15:25.971 --> 15:28.997
- I wanna go up there again.
- Arnie, man, good job.

15:29.074 --> 15:31.542
Don't touch him.

15:31.610 --> 15:34.010
Way to go, Arnie.
Could you do it again for me?

15:34.079 --> 15:36.013
Get out of here.

15:36.081 --> 15:38.515
Could you help me out later
with the fridge?

15:38.584 --> 15:41.382
- With the what?
- Something wrong with the fridge.

15:41.453 --> 15:43.978
- The electricity?
- I don't know. Maybe.

15:44.056 --> 15:46.752
All right.
I have to get my tools.

15:46.900 --> 15:51.100
I'll just come by later.
You be careful, all right?

15:56.500 --> 16:00.100
Don't disappear like that
again on me, okay?

16:03.142 --> 16:05.906
I disappeared on Mom like that.

16:05.978 --> 16:09.072
- Please don't disappear.
- Just let him go.

16:09.148 --> 16:11.446
- Will you bring the milk?
- I promise, Mama.

16:11.517 --> 16:14.145
Good boy. Good boy.

16:15.387 --> 16:16.979
The food.

16:20.993 --> 16:22.654
Are we ready
to talk about the party?

16:22.728 --> 16:26.129
- Sure.
- Ellen's in charge of decorations.

16:26.198 --> 16:27.790
Purple, orange and green.

16:27.866 --> 16:29.197
- Sounds good.
- Theme colors.

16:29.268 --> 16:31.202
That sounds pretty good.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.800
I'm doing the food, the cake.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.300
Arnie, I'm making something
very special for you.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.537
And Mama,
you can supervise everything.

16:40.612 --> 16:43.274
- Okay with everybody?
- That's disgusting.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.900
- Sounds good.
- What about me?

16:46.585 --> 16:48.951
You are the guest of honor.
How about that?

16:49.021 --> 16:51.854
What about me?
It's my party!

16:51.924 --> 16:53.755
You just show up, buddy.
That's your job.

16:53.826 --> 16:56.386
- All you have to do is show up.
- You don't have to do anything.

16:56.395 --> 16:59.262
All you have to do is turn 18.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.100
You know, that just leaves Gilbert.

17:02.201 --> 17:04.761
You're the only one
without anything to do.

17:04.837 --> 17:06.828
- Got any ideas?
- Sure he does.

17:06.905 --> 17:09.635
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

17:09.708 --> 17:12.175
I'm almost 16,
and I've got pages of ideas.

17:12.243 --> 17:15.645
She designed a whole cake,
and you haven't done anything.

17:15.714 --> 17:18.012
- Stop it, Ellen.
- Can I be excused?

17:18.083 --> 17:22.315
- He never does anything!
- Can't we do something as a family?

17:22.387 --> 17:24.356
- This is no fair!
- Can I please be excused?

17:24.423 --> 17:28.917
- We're planning this as a family.
- It's my party though!

17:28.994 --> 17:33.829
So it's gonna be an exact copy of
the original they built in Boone.

17:33.899 --> 17:36.333
- Really?
- Which is no big deal.

17:36.402 --> 17:40.031
All Burger Barns
are built identical.

17:40.105 --> 17:42.539
They're prefabricated.
They just ship 'em out.

17:42.608 --> 17:44.940
It's so efficient.
It's amazing.

17:45.010 --> 17:47.103
In a matter of a couple days...

17:47.200 --> 17:50.200
there can be
a whole new restaurant.

17:50.349 --> 17:53.079
So I was driving past
the building site today.

17:53.152 --> 17:57.054
You know, it's goin' up
right down the road from Foodland.

17:57.122 --> 17:59.716
The general manager was there.
So I says...

17:59.800 --> 18:03.400
"Can I fill out an application?"
He said, "You bet you can."

18:03.562 --> 18:05.689
So I did, you know,
and it looks really good.

18:05.764 --> 18:09.393
I might be wearin' one of them
uniforms, flippin' some burgers...

18:09.468 --> 18:12.631
saltin' some fries.

18:12.800 --> 18:18.400
You never know. It could be the
best thing that ever happened to me.

18:19.611 --> 18:21.306
Get out of here!

18:23.148 --> 18:24.740
I saw her!

18:26.985 --> 18:29.613
- That wasn't nice.
- What? What did I do?

18:29.688 --> 18:31.553
You know what you did.

18:31.623 --> 18:34.285
That's your mother in there.

18:34.359 --> 18:36.418
- Your mother.
- I know.

18:38.697 --> 18:41.188
I don't get you, man.
I just don't get it.

18:41.266 --> 18:43.791
- Let's go, buddy.
- Okay.

18:43.869 --> 18:46.235
Come on.

18:46.305 --> 18:48.899
Run, now! Run!

18:51.610 --> 18:54.477
- Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye, you guys.

19:15.934 --> 19:18.767
I'm not tired yet, Gilbert.

19:19.838 --> 19:21.635
Gotta go to sleep, okay?

19:21.707 --> 19:24.232
Okay. Good-bye.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.600
No, it's not good-bye.
It's good night.

19:28.447 --> 19:31.610
Good-bye is for when
you're going away.

19:31.683 --> 19:33.617
And we're not going anywhere,
are we?

19:33.685 --> 19:35.585
I know that.

19:35.654 --> 19:37.815
- Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
- See you tomorrow.

19:37.890 --> 19:41.053
We're not going anywhere!

19:41.994 --> 19:43.222
Good-bye!

19:55.006 --> 19:56.906
- You gotta work later?
- Yeah, I do.

19:56.975 --> 19:58.670
Hi there, ladies.

19:58.744 --> 20:01.645
- I gotta come back.
- How's Mama?

20:01.713 --> 20:04.910
- She's fat.
- Come on, man.

20:04.983 --> 20:07.474
- She's not all that big.
- What?

20:07.552 --> 20:11.852
I saw a guy at the state fair
who was a little bit bigger.

20:11.923 --> 20:13.914
A little bit bigger?

20:13.992 --> 20:16.517
All I'm saying is she's not
the biggest I've ever seen.

20:16.595 --> 20:19.120
- Tucker, she's a whale!
- Take her out for a walk.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.300
- Take her out for a jog.
- Tucker, she's a whale!

20:25.203 --> 20:27.967
- I'm just sayin' give her a chance.
- Hi, guys.

20:28.039 --> 20:31.338
- How's business?
- Not good.

20:31.410 --> 20:33.469
Nobody's dying.

20:33.545 --> 20:37.311
There's a clear ladder.
There's a clear corporate ladder.

20:37.382 --> 20:40.180
- I mean, this is not...
- That's good.

20:40.252 --> 20:42.447
That's a good thing for you to do.

20:42.521 --> 20:44.819
If you guys would give it a chance...

20:44.890 --> 20:48.257
I just was saying that it wasn't
something I should be doing myself.

20:48.326 --> 20:50.021
They use canola oil, okay?

20:50.095 --> 20:52.120
You know what canola oil is?
You probably don't.

20:52.197 --> 20:54.461
They probably don't sell it
at Lamson's Grocery.

20:54.533 --> 20:58.299
It's cutting edge.
It creates a crispier french fry...

20:58.370 --> 21:01.305
and a more unique product.

21:01.373 --> 21:04.865
And Burger Barn... Forget Wendy's,
Burger King, McDonald's.

21:04.943 --> 21:07.571
That's old hat.
Burger Barn's cutting edge.

21:07.646 --> 21:10.080
I mean,
I could really stand behind it.

21:10.148 --> 21:13.379
It's an innovative place.
They created the salad bar...

21:13.452 --> 21:18.082
which is now mimicked by every
single fast-food chain in America.

21:18.156 --> 21:19.680
They came up with that.

21:19.758 --> 21:23.922
Fifteen different toppings for
each salad, two kinds of lettuce.

21:23.995 --> 21:27.522
And it's all that you care to eat.

21:28.567 --> 21:32.594
You either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager...

21:32.671 --> 21:35.504
of you can go from clerk
to cashier captain...

21:35.574 --> 21:37.132
to assistant manager.

21:37.209 --> 21:41.202
And then from assistant manager,
you could go to manager...

21:41.279 --> 21:44.373
and then regional manager
and then...

21:52.958 --> 21:55.825
Look at the little fellas.

21:55.894 --> 21:57.987
You mean my hoppers.

21:58.063 --> 21:59.997
Let's try this.

22:00.065 --> 22:01.657
For my friend.

22:04.870 --> 22:07.065
There you go, my boy.

22:07.138 --> 22:09.868
What do you say, Arnie?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.500
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

22:22.721 --> 22:24.416
This Thursday.

22:26.658 --> 22:29.491
It's our anniversary.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.800
I'll need a delivery later.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.304
Have a nice day.

23:24.416 --> 23:26.850
He's behind the chips.

23:29.688 --> 23:31.815
- Delivery, son.
- Excuse me?

23:31.900 --> 23:35.400
Delivery. She's gonna be
needin' some help.

23:36.227 --> 23:38.195
Yes, sir.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.200
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.

23:42.334 --> 23:44.268
I'll do it, Gilbert.

23:49.900 --> 23:52.400
- Here. Wait a sec.
- I got it!

23:54.312 --> 23:56.371
- I did it, huh?
- Look there.

23:56.448 --> 23:58.313
I did it by myself.

23:58.383 --> 24:01.910
Yeah. Look at that.

24:16.001 --> 24:18.128
I could go at any time.

24:20.972 --> 24:22.496
Any time.

24:24.743 --> 24:26.711
Excuse me. Where to?

24:26.800 --> 24:28.900
Just keep going straight.

24:30.582 --> 24:32.174
All right.

24:33.852 --> 24:36.787
My mom wants me to become 18.

24:36.855 --> 24:40.256
I'm having a big party, huh?

24:40.325 --> 24:43.624
- When is that party coming?
- Six days.

24:43.700 --> 24:47.500
Six days and my party,
and I'm gonna become 18.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.200
I'm 18, and you're not invited.

24:51.202 --> 24:53.602
- Don't be rude.
- It's okay.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.700
He's just being honest.
I don't mind.

25:06.184 --> 25:08.914
- I got the groceries!
- Be careful with them.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
I got the groceries.
I got 'em, okay?

25:16.695 --> 25:19.789
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

25:19.900 --> 25:23.800
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm really sorry.

25:24.202 --> 25:26.033
It's okay.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.700
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.607
Are you sorry?

25:33.311 --> 25:35.677
I'm not sorry. He's not sorry.
We're not sorry.

25:35.747 --> 25:37.977
Don't be sorry.

25:38.049 --> 25:40.415
I'm not sorry.

25:45.223 --> 25:48.249
If people are gonna come that early,
we should have some appetizers.

25:48.326 --> 25:51.454
That'd be good. You know
those little Vienna sausage things?

25:51.600 --> 25:55.700
You put 'em in grape jelly
and ketchup and make a sauce.

25:55.833 --> 25:57.994
- I want hot dogs, Mom.
- How about pretzels?

25:58.069 --> 26:01.334
You know, like those Hawaiian
appetizers they make with...

26:01.405 --> 26:03.339
You get pineapple chunks
out of the can...

26:03.407 --> 26:06.035
and you wrap them with
little pieces of bacon...

26:06.200 --> 26:08.900
- and put a toothpick through 'em.
- How do you cook the bacon?

26:09.046 --> 26:10.536
In the oven on a pan.

26:10.615 --> 26:14.107
The bacon's not gonna be crisp if
you bake it in the oven on a sheet.

26:14.185 --> 26:16.312
- Yes, it will.
- Nobody wants greasy...

26:16.387 --> 26:19.117
- I want hot dogs!
- ...floppy bacon.

26:19.190 --> 26:22.853
- I want hot dogs!
- We're gonna have hot dogs, honey.

26:22.927 --> 26:26.124
I promise,
we're gonna have hot dogs.

26:26.197 --> 26:30.634
The thing about every party
that I've been to is that... What?

26:30.701 --> 26:33.295
Could you not talk
with your mouth full?

26:33.371 --> 26:34.668
Excuse me?

26:34.800 --> 26:38.300
You're making me sick.
I'm gonna throw up.

26:39.076 --> 26:40.805
Okay, Dad.

26:42.113 --> 26:44.274
- Sure thing, Dad.
- Will you two cut it out?

26:44.348 --> 26:47.340
- Okay, Dad. Sure thing, Dad.
- That's nice.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.900
- Stop it, you guys.
- Dad's dead, Ellen.

26:51.222 --> 26:54.089
- I can't believe you said that.
- Shut up!

26:54.158 --> 26:55.591
Dad's dead!

26:55.700 --> 26:57.700
- Arnie...
- Dad's dead!

26:58.830 --> 27:02.357
Arnie, it's okay.
Stop it now.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.500
- Oh, God.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

27:05.636 --> 27:08.764
- Mama, don't get upset.
- Make him stop.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.104
- Arnie, shut up!
- Dead! Dead! Dead!

27:11.175 --> 27:13.871
- You're crazy, Arnie!
- Stop it.

27:17.949 --> 27:20.247
- Just calm down.
- Stop it!

27:20.318 --> 27:22.946
- Stop it!
- That's enough!

27:23.020 --> 27:25.215
Arnie, that's enough!

27:25.289 --> 27:28.258
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

27:28.326 --> 27:31.090
- Arnie, be quiet.
- Dad's dead!

27:31.162 --> 27:33.722
I said, stop it right now!

27:36.601 --> 27:38.660
It should be two-by-tens
or two-by-twelves...

27:38.736 --> 27:41.136
and the space
between 'em here should...

27:41.205 --> 27:43.571
Right now, it's at two feet.

27:43.641 --> 27:46.007
This should be 16 inches.
I mean, that's just standard.

27:46.077 --> 27:49.808
And this right here...
See this here? Flat flooring?

27:49.900 --> 27:54.500
Once the wood gets old,
you're gonna fall right through it.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.000
I guess Daddy wasn't
much of a carpenter.

27:58.700 --> 28:03.400
Gilbert, why did he use
two-by-sixes instead of two-by...

28:03.594 --> 28:05.789
- What?
- Keep it down.

28:05.863 --> 28:07.421
Sorry.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.700
She's coming.
She's coming.

28:40.031 --> 28:41.726
You all right?
You okay?

28:41.799 --> 28:43.767
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:43.834 --> 28:45.358
Thanks a lot for coming.

28:45.436 --> 28:48.166
I'll come by tomorrow
with the wood.

28:48.239 --> 28:50.799
Let's keep it quiet.
I forgot to tell you.

28:50.875 --> 28:52.536
- What?
- Burger Barn.

28:52.610 --> 28:54.635
I'm in. I got the call.

28:54.712 --> 28:57.579
- Good.
- It's not too late, you know.

28:57.648 --> 28:58.876
Good night.

29:01.852 --> 29:03.285
I think she's asleep.

29:03.354 --> 29:07.654
Say you wanna slice down zucchini
squash in the food dehydrator.

29:07.725 --> 29:10.353
- Look at this.
- Wonderful!

29:10.428 --> 29:14.228
- Perfect slices every time. Nice?
- Marvelous.

29:14.298 --> 29:16.823
'Course, if you know someone
that can't chew too well...

29:16.901 --> 29:18.698
take the corn off the cob.

29:18.800 --> 29:23.300
Look at this. We'll just
turn down the dial a little...

29:26.811 --> 29:29.780
...freeze corn and sit there
for hours with a knife...

29:29.847 --> 29:31.439
literally hours,
cutting their corn.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.600
- Unbelievable!
- 'Course, for un...

29:37.555 --> 29:40.956
- Right now, you get the...
- What are you doing?

29:41.025 --> 29:43.459
- Give me that.
- Sorry, Mama.

29:43.527 --> 29:44.960
Jeez.

29:46.297 --> 29:51.325
The $30 Dial-O-Matic Food Slicer,
a $ 160 value, right now.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.800
I made up that bed for you.

29:54.872 --> 29:56.601
What for?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.800
Just in case you wanted a change.

30:01.379 --> 30:04.007
I'm happy right where I am.

30:04.081 --> 30:07.448
- You sure?
- Yeah.

30:20.798 --> 30:22.390
Here you go.

30:26.604 --> 30:28.697
Here you go, Mama.

30:28.773 --> 30:30.263
Thanks, kids.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.700
- Good night, Mama.
- You're so helpful.

30:41.185 --> 30:43.710
I took her delivery,
we talked a little bit.

30:43.788 --> 30:45.722
And that was it.
I dropped her off.

30:45.790 --> 30:47.985
What's she doing here?

30:48.059 --> 30:49.924
I don't know.
She's just sort of here.

30:49.994 --> 30:51.723
I think their car broke down.

30:51.796 --> 30:53.559
Come on.
I see it in your face.

30:53.631 --> 30:57.431
Can we not talk about this now?
Can we change the subject?

30:57.501 --> 30:59.093
Do you understand?

30:59.170 --> 31:01.764
We want a pool.

31:05.843 --> 31:08.203
- You're tellin' me later.
- I'll tell you everything later.

31:08.212 --> 31:10.806
Look at those guys out there.

31:10.881 --> 31:15.147
They're laughing,
they're all happy...

31:15.219 --> 31:18.245
and waving to their friends.

31:18.322 --> 31:21.257
But the next day... and this is
the thing they don't know...

31:21.325 --> 31:24.522
they could be lying on the slab.

31:24.595 --> 31:27.587
It's kind of harsh.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.300
But it's kind of fun too.

31:36.173 --> 31:38.437
- Do you ever...
- What?

31:41.500 --> 31:42.800
Well, you know.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.300
Are you tempted to, like...

31:48.500 --> 31:51.400
wanna fool around with the bodies?

31:51.889 --> 31:54.050
No, I've always wanted to ask.

31:54.125 --> 31:56.059
I'm sorry if
it makes you uncomfortable.

31:56.127 --> 31:59.563
- People are curious about that.
- If you don't wanna talk about it...

31:59.630 --> 32:03.031
The worst thing that we do is
we take the grotesque bodies...

32:03.100 --> 32:05.830
the really ugly ones...

32:05.903 --> 32:09.498
and we make
harmless jokes about them.

32:09.573 --> 32:12.303
Very harmless jokes,
but we come up with...

32:12.376 --> 32:15.675
some very good jokes about them...

32:15.746 --> 32:17.907
my father and me.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.400
But, you know, they're dead.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.400
- Nobody hears anything.
- Hi, boys.

32:24.588 --> 32:27.056
Hello, Mrs. Carver.

32:27.124 --> 32:29.922
Those jokes don't hurt anybody.
Nobody knows we even make them.

32:29.993 --> 32:32.860
Gilbert, I'm waiting for your call.

32:32.930 --> 32:36.058
Mr. Carver, I haven't seen
your mother in church lately.

32:36.133 --> 32:38.226
- How's she doing?
- She's fine.

32:38.302 --> 32:41.100
Thanks. Bye.

32:41.171 --> 32:43.731
He wants to kill you, right?

32:43.807 --> 32:47.174
Do you prefer a bronze casket?

33:09.967 --> 33:12.128
Can somebody give me
a hand down here?

33:12.202 --> 33:15.467
- What?
- I need a hand with the wood.

33:20.900 --> 33:23.000
You wanna go help Tucker?

33:25.800 --> 33:28.400
Go help Tucker in the basement.

33:34.458 --> 33:37.757
- Go into the basement...
- I don't wanna go down there.

33:37.828 --> 33:41.594
- Please?
- No way! No way! You!

33:41.700 --> 33:45.600
- Go down there, Gilbert.
- Is there a problem?

33:48.472 --> 33:51.635
Dad's in there!

33:59.149 --> 34:00.741
Shut up!

34:14.231 --> 34:15.822
Come on!

34:23.040 --> 34:24.940
It's not funny!

34:25.007 --> 34:26.600
Get back here!

34:30.947 --> 34:33.678
Don't worry.
Those are two-by-sixes.

34:33.800 --> 34:37.699
There's six of'em,
so those could hold anybody.

34:46.463 --> 34:48.054
- I forgot.
- What?

34:51.400 --> 34:54.699
I forgot that
that was where your dad...

34:59.676 --> 35:01.268
I'm sorry.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.300
No, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

35:13.123 --> 35:16.024
- No, Arnie! No climbing!
- I wanna go up there!

35:16.093 --> 35:17.390
No, you're not!

35:19.663 --> 35:21.290
Not again!

35:21.365 --> 35:23.925
- I wanna go up there!
- Get down. Get down.

35:24.001 --> 35:25.468
Get down!

35:28.238 --> 35:31.867
You're not going anywhere!
Not too much fun, is it?

35:31.942 --> 35:34.172
I wanna go up there!

35:41.418 --> 35:43.010
We're going home.

35:44.521 --> 35:46.546
- Stop!
- Ellen, no!

35:46.623 --> 35:48.955
Stop it!
I told you, don't touch him.

35:49.026 --> 35:51.017
- Don't ever touch him again.
- He was climbing again!

35:51.094 --> 35:54.530
I don't care.
Just get out of here!

35:54.600 --> 35:57.800
Let me see, buddy.
Come on. Let me see.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.300
Oh, great.
You made him bleed!

36:03.040 --> 36:05.508
What does Gilbert say?

36:05.575 --> 36:08.009
If anybody ever hits you...

36:08.100 --> 36:12.800
or even just lays a finger on you,
what are you gonna do?

36:15.686 --> 36:19.679
You're gonna tell me, and then
I'm gonna take care of it for you.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.400
And why will I take care of it?

36:24.528 --> 36:27.053
- Because you're Gilbert.
- Because I'm Gilbert.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.000
Because nobody hurts Arnie,
right?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.500
You wanna pick out some candy?

36:40.444 --> 36:43.038
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What do you want?

36:43.113 --> 36:45.775
We've got to keep
a closer eye on him.

36:45.849 --> 36:48.750
- What?
- We've gotta do better.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.900
Are you listening to me?

36:54.691 --> 36:55.817
Mine.

36:55.892 --> 36:59.328
And you.
You have to stay here.

36:59.396 --> 37:02.695
You stay right on this porch.
You don't go anywhere.

37:02.766 --> 37:06.793
- Don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.

37:06.900 --> 37:09.000
We're not going anywhere.

37:31.962 --> 37:33.725
Where are you going?

38:39.000 --> 38:42.600
I'm waiting.
Waitin' for that call, Gilbert.

38:57.581 --> 38:59.515
- Look. Come here.
- What?

38:59.583 --> 39:02.347
It's a praying mantis.

39:02.419 --> 39:06.321
You know how they mate? The male
will sneak up on the female...

39:06.390 --> 39:08.449
and she'll bite off his head...

39:08.525 --> 39:10.993
and the rest of his body
will keep on mating.

39:11.061 --> 39:13.222
And then when they're done...

39:13.297 --> 39:15.322
she'll eat him.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.700
She'll eat the rest of him.

39:18.569 --> 39:22.938
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?

39:25.900 --> 39:28.300
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

39:32.300 --> 39:35.600
Well, we missed the rally
in Des Moines.

39:36.854 --> 39:38.788
If we get on the road by Friday,
we'll be able...

39:38.856 --> 39:41.723
to make Colorado Springs
in time to catch them.

39:41.792 --> 39:43.760
Have you ever been to Colorado?

39:43.827 --> 39:45.692
No, ma'am.

39:45.763 --> 39:47.663
It must be wonderful.

39:47.731 --> 39:49.756
It must be incredibly
frustrating then...

39:49.833 --> 39:52.324
to be stuck here in this place,
in Endora.

39:52.403 --> 39:55.167
This place
is as good a place as any.

39:55.239 --> 39:57.537
Think so?

39:57.608 --> 39:59.098
She should know.

39:59.943 --> 40:02.605
Becky's been just about
everywhere there is to go.

40:02.679 --> 40:04.613
Places I didn't even know existed.

40:04.681 --> 40:07.878
I'm a worldly kind of girl.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.289
Me, I spent most of my whole life
in the same spot.

40:14.358 --> 40:16.622
Why doesn't matter.

40:16.693 --> 40:20.288
Anyway, she encouraged me
to get out.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.100
Now she can't stay put anywhere.

40:25.803 --> 40:29.000
She's the smartest,
most beautiful girl in the world.

40:29.072 --> 40:31.040
Isn't she beautiful?

40:36.680 --> 40:40.207
I'm sorry. She has this thing
with beauty that...

40:40.284 --> 40:42.752
Yeah, I noticed that.

40:42.820 --> 40:47.154
I'm not into that...
that whole external beauty thing.

40:47.224 --> 40:50.660
- 'Cause it doesn't last.
- Right.

40:50.727 --> 40:54.163
Eventually, your face
is gonna get wrinkly...

40:54.231 --> 40:57.826
you'll get gray hair,
your boobs might sag.

40:57.901 --> 41:00.199
You know? So what?

41:00.270 --> 41:03.262
It's what you do
that really matters.

41:03.340 --> 41:05.900
- Right?
- Yeah, sure.

41:05.976 --> 41:08.069
So what do you wanna do?

41:09.800 --> 41:14.200
I don't know. There's not
so much to do here, really.

41:14.400 --> 41:19.500
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing people do here.

41:23.527 --> 41:25.586
Thank you.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.700
It was nice meeting you.

41:29.867 --> 41:30.925
Be nice.

41:46.100 --> 41:50.100
Can I have yours
and I'll give you mine instead?

41:50.654 --> 41:52.315
We want the big one!

41:52.389 --> 41:54.949
You know something?
The one on top of it is fine.

41:55.025 --> 41:58.085
We want the big one!

42:00.063 --> 42:02.122
- Let's go.
- Get us the big one!

42:02.199 --> 42:05.168
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- Here you go, guys.

42:05.300 --> 42:08.800
- We want the big one.
- Yeah, that's fine.

42:09.873 --> 42:11.773
It's changing.

42:11.842 --> 42:14.310
That's what's wild about the sunset.

42:14.400 --> 42:19.500
It'll just change really,
really slowly in front of your eyes.

42:24.922 --> 42:27.288
I love the sky.

42:27.357 --> 42:31.418
It's so limitless.

42:32.563 --> 42:35.361
It is big.
It's very big.

42:35.432 --> 42:37.332
Big doesn't even sum it up right.

42:37.401 --> 42:39.198
That word "big" is so small.

42:39.269 --> 42:42.796
You'd have to get
those really giant words...

42:42.873 --> 42:45.307
to describe the sky.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.541
What?

42:53.100 --> 42:57.000
I have to go do this thing.
It's kind of a family thing.

42:57.154 --> 43:00.282
Do you want me to give you a ride
back into town, or do you wanna...

43:00.400 --> 43:03.500
No, actually,
I'm just gonna sit here.

43:07.631 --> 43:10.759
I could come back.
I mean, I can come back and...

43:10.834 --> 43:13.359
- Really?
- Yeah. You'll be here then?

43:13.437 --> 43:15.530
Yeah. I'll just sit here.

43:15.700 --> 43:19.000
All right, I'll be back
in a little bit.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.000
Hey, buddy. Come on.
We gotta go.

43:29.620 --> 43:32.214
Where's the duck?
I can't see the duck anywhere.

43:32.289 --> 43:35.520
- Find him. Look. Where'd he go?
- Where's the duck?

43:35.592 --> 43:39.050
- It's hiding. Find the duck.
- I don't have time for this.

43:39.129 --> 43:41.427
Lift up. Okay, good.

43:41.498 --> 43:44.626
- Ducky.
- Good boy. You know what?

43:44.701 --> 43:47.169
- You're such a big boy.
- Yeah.

43:47.237 --> 43:49.467
- You're such a big boy.
- I'm a big boy.

43:49.600 --> 43:54.200
I bet you could do this all
by yourself if you really wanted to.

43:54.378 --> 43:56.676
- Could you do this by yourself?
- I'm a big boy.

43:56.747 --> 43:58.806
- Yeah, be a big boy.
- Big boy.

43:58.882 --> 44:01.715
Take this, wash everything.

44:01.785 --> 44:05.915
Your towels are there,
and your robe is there.

44:05.989 --> 44:09.516
- The big boy's gonna wash himself.
- Right.

44:09.593 --> 44:11.720
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

44:14.097 --> 44:17.089
- You missed it.
- What did I miss?

44:17.167 --> 44:19.499
- The sunset.
- Really?

44:19.569 --> 44:22.094
It was beautiful.

44:22.172 --> 44:23.764
Oh, well.

44:27.644 --> 44:30.738
I'd like to see where you live.

44:30.814 --> 44:32.372
No, you wouldn't.

44:32.449 --> 44:34.713
Let's go see where you live.

44:34.785 --> 44:36.377
Come on.

44:43.300 --> 44:46.300
My parents split up
when I was a kid.

44:47.297 --> 44:49.629
I go back and forth between them...

44:49.700 --> 44:52.200
'cause they're always moving.

44:52.702 --> 44:55.899
But it's good.
It's my life.

44:59.742 --> 45:01.869
We don't really move.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.400
I mean, we'd like to, but...

45:05.700 --> 45:09.000
my mom is sort of
attached to the house.

45:09.652 --> 45:12.246
Attached is, I guess,
not the right word.

45:12.322 --> 45:14.688
She's pretty much wedged in.

45:14.757 --> 45:18.090
- What do you mean?
- That's it.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.700
That's the house.

45:22.298 --> 45:24.391
It's really amazing.

45:24.500 --> 45:29.100
I mean, how small it looks
from here, considering the...

45:29.200 --> 45:32.000
the girth of what's inside of it.

45:36.846 --> 45:39.144
I don't know.

45:39.300 --> 45:43.200
Did you ever see
a beached whale on television?

45:44.754 --> 45:47.723
That's her.
That's my mom.

45:52.829 --> 45:54.763
What about your dad?

45:55.898 --> 45:59.197
Some other day.
Some other day.

46:12.649 --> 46:15.243
I had a nice time tonight.

46:17.053 --> 46:19.317
I know.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.600
- Good night.
- Good night.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.800
Come on.
I'm sorry. Come on.

47:18.681 --> 47:20.672
Here. You're okay.

47:25.054 --> 47:26.783
Come on. Get warm.

47:26.856 --> 47:30.348
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.

47:30.426 --> 47:34.123
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

47:34.197 --> 47:37.826
- Would somebody please explain?
- Gilbert's in charge of bathing.

47:37.900 --> 47:40.164
I could have "drownded."

47:43.172 --> 47:45.572
- No more baths.
- But you didn't, honey.

47:45.700 --> 47:49.700
- You could've, but you didn't.
- No more baths.

47:51.600 --> 47:55.400
It is too much to ask
to see this boy turn 18?

47:56.319 --> 47:57.513
It's ready.

47:57.587 --> 48:00.078
Where's your head lately?

48:00.156 --> 48:02.920
Where is your head?

48:04.160 --> 48:07.652
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry isn't good enough.

48:07.730 --> 48:09.823
You gotta do better.

48:09.899 --> 48:11.958
Gotta do better.

48:14.300 --> 48:17.300
Hey, boss, is that the right price?

48:18.207 --> 48:20.232
That's right.

48:20.309 --> 48:24.006
- It seems like it ought to be more.
- Maybe at Foodland.

48:24.080 --> 48:27.413
We've always had
a reasonable deal on pickles.

48:27.483 --> 48:28.916
Here.

48:31.554 --> 48:33.579
Gilbert, got a delivery
for you, son.

48:33.656 --> 48:35.248
It sounds urgent.

48:46.436 --> 48:49.234
Get out.
Go outside and play, right now.

48:49.305 --> 48:51.569
Right now. Hurry up.

48:59.900 --> 49:01.400
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

49:04.387 --> 49:06.981
Could you dial that number
over there for me?

49:07.056 --> 49:10.583
- My hands are all...
- Yeah, sure.

49:10.660 --> 49:12.628
- How have you been?
- Good.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.500
I saw you last night.

49:16.165 --> 49:17.928
Who's the girl?

49:19.001 --> 49:22.368
- It's ringing.
- Sorry. One sec.

49:24.100 --> 49:25.800
This is good. Taste.

49:26.742 --> 49:28.209
That's good. It's ringing.

49:28.277 --> 49:30.541
One second.

49:31.600 --> 49:35.000
Hello? Ken Carver here,
Carver Insurance.

49:39.989 --> 49:42.856
- Mr. Carver?
- Who is this?

49:42.925 --> 49:44.358
It's Gilbert.

49:46.762 --> 49:49.595
I'd given up on you, Gilbert.

49:49.700 --> 49:53.200
- Did you?
- Well, yeah. Can you blame me?

49:53.302 --> 49:56.760
I mean, how many times do I have
to ask, and still no visit?

49:56.839 --> 49:59.865
- Well, I'm here now.
- Happy anniversary.

49:59.942 --> 50:02.206
Well, we can't discuss this
over the phone. I think it's best...

50:02.278 --> 50:05.111
that we meet man to man,
don't you agree?

50:05.181 --> 50:07.547
- Yes.
- Today is your lucky day.

50:07.700 --> 50:13.100
I've just had a cancellation.
What about right now? Are you free?

50:14.457 --> 50:15.924
Is that a yes?

50:17.927 --> 50:19.258
- Okay.
- All right.

50:19.400 --> 50:22.300
I'm gonna be waiting here for you.

50:23.866 --> 50:27.267
Do you want me to be killed?
Do you want him to kill me?

50:27.336 --> 50:30.499
Just playing.
Don't you wanna play?

50:30.573 --> 50:32.006
This is crazy.

50:32.074 --> 50:34.872
- I've gotta go.
- You don't have to go.

50:34.944 --> 50:36.172
Yes, I do.

50:39.849 --> 50:42.317
It's that new girl, isn't it?

50:42.400 --> 50:46.100
It's your husband. He wants me
to come to his office right now.

50:46.222 --> 50:49.248
If you walk out that door...

50:49.400 --> 50:52.300
Don't you dare walk out that door.

51:16.200 --> 51:18.400
You look nervous, Gilbert.

51:19.600 --> 51:22.400
I'd be nervous too if I were you.

51:22.900 --> 51:27.400
If I were in your situation,
I'd be downright panicky.

51:27.830 --> 51:30.526
I reviewed your file.

51:30.600 --> 51:33.700
You've got
no major medical insurance.

51:33.936 --> 51:36.666
No catastrophic, no life.

51:41.100 --> 51:44.400
What if something
were to happen to you?

51:44.913 --> 51:47.473
Something unforeseeable?

51:47.549 --> 51:50.143
Something sudden? Random?

51:51.553 --> 51:55.182
An accident, maybe.
What about your family?

51:57.200 --> 52:00.200
Do you ever think about your family?

52:01.100 --> 52:05.000
Stop thinking about yourself.
Think about them.

52:05.267 --> 52:09.328
You don't wanna leave 'em
empty-handed.

52:09.404 --> 52:12.066
Ken Carver here.

52:12.200 --> 52:15.200
Can't this wait?
I'm in the middle...

52:16.912 --> 52:19.506
Please, calm down.
Calm down.

52:22.751 --> 52:23.945
Go on.

52:41.169 --> 52:43.603
Calm... I'm on my way.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.500
Troubles at home.
I'm sure you understand.

52:52.848 --> 52:55.214
Damn. Betty's got the car.

52:55.284 --> 52:58.253
Would you give me a ride?

53:19.074 --> 53:21.304
Oh, my God! Betty!

53:21.376 --> 53:23.537
What the hell's going on here?

53:23.612 --> 53:26.012
Todd? Doug?
What is going on here?

53:26.081 --> 53:28.015
I don't believe this!

53:30.052 --> 53:31.644
Oh, great!

53:34.356 --> 53:35.948
Boys, come on.

53:36.100 --> 53:40.000
Let's go show your mom the cookies
that she's baked for us.

53:40.195 --> 53:41.662
This is great.

53:44.100 --> 53:46.500
All right.
Everything's okay.

53:49.171 --> 53:52.629
Look, honey, they're fine.
They taste fine.

53:52.708 --> 53:55.472
They're a little burnt on top,
but just fine.

53:55.544 --> 53:58.445
They're wonderful.

53:58.513 --> 54:01.380
Boys, here.
Have some of Mom's cookies.

54:01.450 --> 54:03.281
They're really good.

54:03.352 --> 54:05.513
Come on, boys.
Make your mother happy.

54:05.600 --> 54:08.800
Make your mom happy.
Have some cookies.

54:12.527 --> 54:16.054
I could've had any guy.
Any guy!

54:16.131 --> 54:18.361
But...

54:18.433 --> 54:20.458
I chose you.

54:21.903 --> 54:24.201
I got you a real pool,
for God's sake!

54:24.272 --> 54:26.832
Look! There's water in here!

54:26.908 --> 54:29.399
Come here!
Get over here!

54:30.779 --> 54:32.246
Get inside the pool!

54:32.314 --> 54:35.249
Get inside the pool
with your brother!

54:35.317 --> 54:37.080
Why did you?

54:37.152 --> 54:40.781
Yeah. Look.
Real water, boys.

54:43.425 --> 54:46.326
Because...

54:46.400 --> 54:48.900
I knew you'd always be there.

54:50.699 --> 54:53.167
Because I knew you'd never leave.

54:53.235 --> 54:56.363
What the hell else
more do you want?

54:56.438 --> 54:59.134
What? For God's sake!

55:01.600 --> 55:05.600
Son, get back in the pool.
Get back in the pool!

55:06.682 --> 55:09.617
We're all gonna enjoy it!
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

55:09.700 --> 55:14.100
I'm doin' the best I can here.
I can't do any better!

55:14.200 --> 55:18.200
I can't give anymore.
I've given enough already.

55:29.504 --> 55:31.529
I guess maybe
I'd better be getting off.

55:31.606 --> 55:32.732
Not yet.

55:34.710 --> 55:37.645
Arthur, in all my life...

55:37.713 --> 55:40.773
I'll wonder, where is he?

55:42.818 --> 55:45.981
Just this moment, just now...

55:47.489 --> 55:50.151
what is he looking at?

55:50.225 --> 55:51.715
What is he thinking?

55:51.800 --> 55:55.300
I think it's time for Arnie
to take a bath.

55:57.199 --> 56:00.327
Don't you think it's time
for Arnie to take a bath, Gilbert?

56:00.402 --> 56:02.666
Just let him stink.

56:02.738 --> 56:05.901
- I don't wanna take a bath!
- Please.

56:05.974 --> 56:08.670
You know Mr. Carver?

56:09.811 --> 56:11.403
Well, he's dead.

56:39.100 --> 56:41.700
- What's going on?
- He drowned.

56:43.700 --> 56:46.300
- You're kidding?
- No. In that.

56:49.100 --> 56:51.600
A kiddie pool.
I don't get it.

56:52.921 --> 56:54.718
It's like one foot deep.
Weird, right?

56:54.800 --> 56:56.800
- Yeah.
- He "drownded."

57:07.102 --> 57:09.935
He had the cardiac arrest.

57:10.005 --> 57:11.802
His head bent forward...

57:11.873 --> 57:13.670
his knees buckled...

57:13.742 --> 57:16.210
and then he just fell...

57:17.279 --> 57:19.042
face forward into the pool.

57:19.114 --> 57:22.049
When she found him,
he was already dead.

57:22.117 --> 57:24.347
That's what we don't know.
That's what nobody knows.

57:24.419 --> 57:28.287
No, I know it.
I saw the body.

57:28.357 --> 57:30.689
I prepared it.
I know exactly what...

57:30.759 --> 57:35.287
I would have seen if there was
any kind of struggle.

57:35.364 --> 57:38.891
- It was murder.
- No.

57:38.967 --> 57:41.231
What do you think?
What do you think?

57:41.303 --> 57:43.328
I don't know.

57:43.405 --> 57:45.202
It's possible.

57:45.273 --> 57:48.800
Bob, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of dollars.

57:48.877 --> 57:51.812
- If she saw...
- She doesn't have to work...

57:51.880 --> 57:54.508
She doesn't have to work
for the rest of her life.

57:54.583 --> 57:56.710
If you saw somebody laying...

57:56.785 --> 57:59.811
with their head down
in the pool motionless...

57:59.888 --> 58:03.016
or even if they were kind of
limply doing that...

58:03.091 --> 58:05.616
- which he wasn't doing...
- You don't know that!

58:05.694 --> 58:09.494
Well, it was an extreme
"post-cardial" infarction.

58:09.564 --> 58:12.624
- Extreme.
- So nothing's fishy?

58:12.701 --> 58:15.670
Gilbert, look!
It's that girl!

58:15.737 --> 58:18.069
It's that girl!

58:19.508 --> 58:21.442
Wait a minute.

58:21.510 --> 58:23.341
We're not talkin' about
takin' a gun and shootin' somebody.

58:23.412 --> 58:27.746
We're talkin' about pushin' along
something rolling in that direction.

58:27.816 --> 58:30.216
Please, play with me over there.

58:30.285 --> 58:33.311
Come on.
Let's play over there.

58:33.388 --> 58:35.049
- How are you doin'?
- Fine.

58:35.123 --> 58:37.318
- Will you play?
- Okay, we'll play.

58:37.392 --> 58:40.088
- Settle down.
- We're gonna play!

58:40.162 --> 58:43.029
- Will you give us a ride?
- Yeah.

58:48.170 --> 58:49.637
So, that's it.

58:50.839 --> 58:53.637
Yeah, I guess so.

58:55.977 --> 58:57.444
The magic part.

59:03.285 --> 59:04.877
The magic part?

59:15.130 --> 59:17.257
- Could we go...
- Grandma, here it is.

59:17.332 --> 59:20.961
- Thanks.
- Can we go play now?

59:21.100 --> 59:25.500
What are we gonna play?
Can we play hide-and-go-seek?

59:27.600 --> 59:31.600
- Would you give me some help?
- Yeah, go ahead.

59:37.085 --> 59:39.645
- Hang on one second.
- Okay.

59:41.723 --> 59:43.156
Try it.

59:52.134 --> 59:53.726
I don't know.

59:53.802 --> 59:57.135
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't...

59:57.205 --> 59:59.105
It's a mystery.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.300
- Listen, thanks anyway.
- No problem.

01:00:02.677 --> 01:00:05.077
Come play with me in the water.

01:00:05.147 --> 01:00:09.083
You can't find me.
You can't find me anywhere.

01:00:09.151 --> 01:00:11.642
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.700
No, I want you to come in with me.

01:00:15.824 --> 01:00:18.019
Say "Where's Arnie?"

01:00:18.093 --> 01:00:19.617
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

01:00:19.694 --> 01:00:22.026
Where's Arnie?

01:00:22.097 --> 01:00:26.557
You can't find me.
Say it again. Hi!

01:00:26.635 --> 01:00:30.036
Say it again,
and you gotta look for me around.

01:00:30.105 --> 01:00:33.268
I wanted you
to swim with me, Arnie.

01:00:33.341 --> 01:00:35.935
Don't even try it, 'cause he's
had a scare with water...

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.900
and he won't come in.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.800
I'm not comin' in the water.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.300
You wanna come in the water?

01:00:46.188 --> 01:00:47.780
Why not?

01:00:50.492 --> 01:00:52.653
Are you scared
to come in the water?

01:00:52.727 --> 01:00:55.491
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

01:00:55.564 --> 01:00:59.125
- I'm sure.
- He's scared.

01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:01.965
Are you scared, Gilbert?

01:01:02.037 --> 01:01:05.473
All right, what do you want to see?
Do you want to see...

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.668
Do you want to see me get wet
a little, like this?

01:01:08.743 --> 01:01:10.904
- Yeah.
- A little splash?

01:01:14.482 --> 01:01:15.949
A little more.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.100
Do you wanna see this?

01:01:21.723 --> 01:01:23.247
You want this, right?

01:01:23.325 --> 01:01:25.020
Huh? You happy?

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:35.700
Tell me what you want
as fast as it comes to you.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.874
Okay, what do you want?

01:01:42.277 --> 01:01:43.801
- Faster!
- Okay.

01:01:43.878 --> 01:01:46.608
I want a new thing.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.800
House. I want a new house
for the family.

01:01:54.889 --> 01:01:57.289
I want Mama...

01:01:57.359 --> 01:01:59.486
to take aerobics classes.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.700
I want Ellen to grow up.

01:02:03.398 --> 01:02:06.731
I want a new brain for Arnie.

01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:08.291
I want...

01:02:09.537 --> 01:02:11.801
What do you want for you?

01:02:11.873 --> 01:02:13.932
Just for you.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.700
I want to be a good person.

01:02:21.783 --> 01:02:24.251
I can't do this.

01:02:24.319 --> 01:02:27.516
- Okay.
- Where's Arnie?

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.700
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen my brother?

01:02:56.951 --> 01:02:58.578
Shit.

01:03:13.134 --> 01:03:15.871
Come on.

01:03:20.842 --> 01:03:23.834
- I did it again!
- Get this unbuckled.

01:03:23.912 --> 01:03:26.506
All right, here we go.
There you go.

01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:28.742
It's all right, Jerry.
I got him. I got him.

01:03:28.817 --> 01:03:31.183
We're takin' him in.

01:03:31.253 --> 01:03:33.221
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise.

01:03:33.288 --> 01:03:35.256
We've warned you,
we've warned your sister...

01:03:35.323 --> 01:03:37.188
that the next time
was gonna be the last time.

01:03:37.259 --> 01:03:41.218
- Great. Great.
- Flash the lights! Play the siren!

01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:43.059
- I don't believe this.
- Play the siren for me!

01:03:43.131 --> 01:03:45.099
Way to go, Gilbert.

01:03:47.502 --> 01:03:49.402
Jerry, listen. You're gonna
have to take it easy on him.

01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:51.803
- We'll take care of him.
- You gotta keep an eye on him.

01:03:51.873 --> 01:03:53.306
All right.

01:03:55.877 --> 01:04:00.109
Do the siren, okay?
Do the siren, all right?

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.327
I know, Sheriff.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.400
I know that, Sheriff.

01:04:19.768 --> 01:04:22.760
Okay. Asshole!

01:04:24.105 --> 01:04:27.836
They're probably just teaching him
a lesson, proving a point.

01:04:27.909 --> 01:04:29.706
Yeah. That's right.

01:04:32.914 --> 01:04:34.347
Get my coat.

01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:37.009
What?

01:04:39.054 --> 01:04:41.682
Get my coat.

01:04:42.891 --> 01:04:44.222
Get it!

01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:57.533
Let's go.

01:05:10.385 --> 01:05:12.250
Well, at least
he's in a safe place.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.700
- At least someone's watching him.
- Ellen, shut up.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.800
You guys wait here.
I'll be right back, okay?

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.400
Mama, let Gilbert handle this.

01:05:43.685 --> 01:05:46.586
- Come on, please.
- Please, have a seat outside.

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:51.500
- You gotta let him out.
- You need to wait your turn, okay?

01:05:51.659 --> 01:05:54.093
I don't think you guys understand.
It's gonna be...

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.800
Look, no one's gonna do a thing
until you go and sit down outside...

01:06:20.121 --> 01:06:22.589
I've come for my son.

01:06:23.725 --> 01:06:27.183
Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.900
Bonnie, you'll need
to fill out some papers.

01:06:31.066 --> 01:06:35.230
- Police procedure requires...
- I want my boy, Jerry.

01:06:35.303 --> 01:06:38.932
My son! Give me my son!

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.500
Come on. You're goin' home.

01:06:54.889 --> 01:06:58.290
Sunshine, you're free!
Oh, baby.

01:06:59.494 --> 01:07:03.294
Don't disappear like that anymore.
Promise me.

01:07:06.067 --> 01:07:08.763
You're free, baby.
Let's go home.

01:07:17.812 --> 01:07:19.245
Look!

01:07:31.759 --> 01:07:34.353
That's why she needs a cane.

01:08:00.255 --> 01:08:02.519
Look at her!

01:08:21.809 --> 01:08:26.246
Mama, they didn't
flash the lights for me either.

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:31.014
Flash the lights.

01:08:39.194 --> 01:08:40.684
Look at me!

01:08:41.662 --> 01:08:45.531
I'm hiding!
Say "Where's Arnie?"

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.500
- Say like that.
- Arnie, get down.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.207
Gilbert, come find me.

01:08:55.676 --> 01:08:57.474
Where's Arnie?

01:09:02.216 --> 01:09:03.809
That's my mom in there.

01:09:03.885 --> 01:09:06.319
My mama.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:09.300
Gilbert,
come play with me up here.

01:09:09.957 --> 01:09:12.221
Come play with me.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.899
God, that was so brave,
what your mother did.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.100
You know that, right?

01:09:36.584 --> 01:09:39.018
I'd like to meet her.

01:09:39.086 --> 01:09:40.678
No, you wouldn't.

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:47.000
Okay, where do you go next?

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.000
I would like to meet your mom.

01:10:34.976 --> 01:10:38.969
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:43.800
we commend to Almighty God
our brother, Kenneth Carver...

01:10:44.218 --> 01:10:47.346
and we commit his body
to the ground.

01:10:47.421 --> 01:10:50.049
Earth to earth...

01:10:50.124 --> 01:10:54.151
ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

01:10:55.229 --> 01:10:57.925
The Lord bless him and keep him.

01:10:57.999 --> 01:11:00.729
The Lord make His face
shine on him...

01:11:00.801 --> 01:11:02.894
and be gracious to him.

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.905
The Lord look upon him
with favor...

01:11:05.973 --> 01:11:07.907
and give him peace.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:13.909
Lord Jesus, by Your death
You took away the sting of death.

01:11:13.981 --> 01:11:17.007
Grant to us, Your servants,
so to follow in faith...

01:11:17.084 --> 01:11:19.609
for You have led the way...

01:11:19.687 --> 01:11:21.807
that we may at length
fall asleep peacefully in You...

01:11:21.856 --> 01:11:26.020
- Look here!
- ...great in Your likeness...

01:11:26.093 --> 01:11:30.154
the God of peace who brought again
from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:11:30.231 --> 01:11:33.564
The great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the covenant...

01:11:33.634 --> 01:11:35.898
It's a Burger Barn, Gilbert!

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.438
...make you perfect in
every good work to do His will...

01:11:38.506 --> 01:11:42.499
...working in you that which is
well pleasing in His sight...

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.500
- Burger Barn!
- ...through Jesus Christ, amen.

01:11:52.553 --> 01:11:55.147
Boys, you can have
anything you want.

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:59.500
You could get candy if you want.
You can have candy if you want.

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:02.959
As for me,
something with menthol, please.

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:04.998
You like gum?

01:12:05.066 --> 01:12:07.591
I like gum.
Here's a good kind.

01:12:07.668 --> 01:12:11.160
Here, take this.
You can have it.

01:12:13.707 --> 01:12:17.006
- You want gum too?
- We're going to St. Louis.

01:12:17.078 --> 01:12:19.774
I can't stay in that house.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.100
I really am sorry about your...

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:31.900
Here, Mommy will take care of it.
You run on outside.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.500
Everybody thinks I killed him.

01:12:39.533 --> 01:12:40.932
Do you?

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:54.372
I miss him...

01:12:58.385 --> 01:13:00.250
and I don't.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400
I miss him, and I don't.

01:13:17.338 --> 01:13:21.798
So, Gilbert,
what's to become of you?

01:13:23.444 --> 01:13:26.311
Oh, I'll probably just...

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.900
You haven't thought about it.

01:13:29.617 --> 01:13:32.848
Poor Gilbert... cooped up...

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.100
taking care of everybody else,
forgettin' all about you.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.200
- Mommy?
- Coming in a minute, honey.

01:13:45.866 --> 01:13:47.857
Concerning my boys?

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I was thinkin' that if my boys
turn out anything like you...

01:14:08.255 --> 01:14:10.746
I was thinkin'
how that would be nice...

01:14:10.824 --> 01:14:13.190
for my boys to be like you.

01:14:30.778 --> 01:14:32.439
He's all yours.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.800
Are you gonna miss her?

01:14:48.128 --> 01:14:50.096
Yeah.

01:14:54.068 --> 01:14:55.330
Good.

01:15:56.763 --> 01:15:58.321
Damn it!

01:16:24.391 --> 01:16:25.722
So...

01:16:25.792 --> 01:16:27.885
what do you think?

01:16:30.197 --> 01:16:32.392
- Wow.
- Right?

01:16:32.466 --> 01:16:35.435
Right?
Here, try a milkshake.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.100
Real milk in there.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.700
- You're kidding.
- Real milk.

01:16:55.722 --> 01:16:57.553
Congratulations!
This looks great!

01:16:57.624 --> 01:16:59.819
- Yeah, thanks a million.
- What?

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.800
You tryin' to depress everybody?
You're gonna ruin their appetites.

01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:06.763
Mike, right? You wanna come
to my party tomorrow?

01:17:06.833 --> 01:17:09.427
I'm gonna be 18 years old.
Wanna come?

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.600
You can come too, if you want to.
I don't know you, but you can come.

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.300
How nice to see so many of you here
on this great day.

01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:22.404
This day marks the beginning
of a new era for Endora...

01:17:22.482 --> 01:17:27.749
for the Burger Barn family and,
I hope, for all of you.

01:17:27.821 --> 01:17:30.085
We at Burger Barn are committed...

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:35.100
to a very special relationship with
you, one that will last and last.

01:17:35.295 --> 01:17:38.731
In a time when so many things
are falling apart...

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.600
Endora decides to give
Burger Barn a chance...

01:17:43.203 --> 01:17:45.569
a new breath of life.

01:17:45.639 --> 01:17:49.905
She fixed it.
The camper's fixed...

01:17:49.976 --> 01:17:53.343
and we're gonna
be leaving tomorrow.

01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:18.662
Come on!

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:40.600
Hey, you can come to my party
tomorrow, okay? You can come.

01:18:49.069 --> 01:18:50.661
So, I'm invited.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.300
Do you not want me to go?

01:19:06.519 --> 01:19:09.488
I mean, go if you want.

01:19:13.093 --> 01:19:16.392
Oh, so is this how you want it?

01:19:22.268 --> 01:19:23.701
I have to go.

01:19:27.307 --> 01:19:29.707
Take care, okay?

01:19:38.151 --> 01:19:39.948
Good-bye, Arnie.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.700
- Come on, let's get that bath.
- No. No!

01:19:52.799 --> 01:19:53.891
Guys!

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.100
You gotta take a bath, Arnie.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.300
Arnie, you gotta do it.
It's your birthday.

01:20:06.346 --> 01:20:09.315
- Arnie, damn it!
- Oh, no!

01:20:12.519 --> 01:20:13.986
Oh, God.

01:20:15.055 --> 01:20:18.752
I can't make another one.
I can't.

01:20:20.794 --> 01:20:23.729
We have to have a cake, Gilbert.

01:20:39.913 --> 01:20:41.847
Attention, Foodland shoppers.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.300
Remember every day this week
is a double coupon day.

01:20:55.061 --> 01:20:58.690
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

01:20:58.765 --> 01:21:01.029
My sister called in
an order for Grape.

01:21:01.101 --> 01:21:03.296
Oh, yeah. It's all set.

01:21:05.171 --> 01:21:10.040
There you go.
That'll be 19.75.

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:29.358
- Go away, Arnie.
- Gilbert, what's in there?

01:21:29.429 --> 01:21:32.523
- It's a surprise. Leave it alone.
- What's in that box?

01:21:32.599 --> 01:21:34.533
Don't touch it.
If you touch it, I'll kill you.

01:21:34.601 --> 01:21:36.535
I can't believe you.

01:21:36.603 --> 01:21:40.403
Look, I'll enjoy the party
from in here. It'll be fine.

01:21:40.473 --> 01:21:43.101
You'll see.
Everything'll be just fine.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.200
What am I
supposed to say to people?

01:21:46.813 --> 01:21:50.681
It's Arnie's 18th birthday. You've
waited to do this for a long time.

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:53.810
Wasn't it you who wanted to have
this huge party in the first place?

01:21:53.887 --> 01:21:56.355
I didn't want to.

01:21:57.657 --> 01:22:00.626
- Damn it!
- I can't believe you!

01:22:00.693 --> 01:22:03.389
- Arnie!
- Oh, man.

01:22:03.463 --> 01:22:05.055
- Look, he's eating the cake!
- Shit!

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.500
- That's it. Forget it.
- Nice job, Arnie.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.700
Now what are we gonna do?

01:22:14.607 --> 01:22:16.541
Come here. Come here!

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:21.200
Do you know what that fucking cost?
Do you know what I had to do?

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.700
Come on.
No, no, it's time for your bath.

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:34.700
Get your clothes off.
Get 'em off!

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.599
Get in that bath.
Get them fucking clothes off.

01:22:44.670 --> 01:22:46.365
Come on.

01:22:49.542 --> 01:22:51.533
Don't move. Don't move!

01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:53.407
Gilbert, stop!

01:23:24.343 --> 01:23:26.277
What did you do?

01:23:59.044 --> 01:24:01.444
What is goin' on?

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:05.800
Don't worry, Mama.
Ellen, let's go.

01:25:56.795 --> 01:25:59.889
- We should call his mother.
- No, no. It's okay.

01:25:59.965 --> 01:26:02.263
I know where he lives.
I can take him.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400
It's really okay. Yeah.

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.500
Arnie, you wanna go for a walk?

01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:20.211
You wanna go play, Arnie?

01:26:39.438 --> 01:26:41.030
Come on, Arnie.

01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:55.900
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.
- Come on, Arnie. You can do it.

01:26:56.522 --> 01:27:00.356
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it. Come on.

01:27:00.425 --> 01:27:03.155
- "Merrily, merrily." Sing that.
- Okay.

01:27:03.228 --> 01:27:05.423
Row, row, row your boat.

01:27:05.497 --> 01:27:07.988
Gently down the stream.

01:27:10.602 --> 01:27:11.967
You did it!

01:27:13.138 --> 01:27:16.335
Good job, Arnie!
You did it!

01:27:22.381 --> 01:27:25.248
So I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

01:27:25.317 --> 01:27:28.013
- Bye!
- Bye, Arnie.

01:27:28.086 --> 01:27:29.747
Take care.

01:27:29.822 --> 01:27:32.985
I "drownded," huh?
I "drownded" over there.

01:27:33.058 --> 01:27:35.720
No, you just got clean.

01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:47.571
So he's clean now, you guys.

01:27:47.639 --> 01:27:49.573
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

01:27:49.641 --> 01:27:52.007
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

01:27:52.077 --> 01:27:54.511
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:56.172
You're welcome.

01:28:23.642 --> 01:28:25.234
I hit him.

01:28:26.879 --> 01:28:29.040
I hit him so hard, I...

01:28:32.251 --> 01:28:34.776
He's gonna be okay.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.900
You don't hurt Arnie.
You just don't.

01:28:49.568 --> 01:28:53.595
I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:29:24.203 --> 01:29:26.137
I got nowhere to go.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.500
I had to work extra hours
just to feed her.

01:29:37.083 --> 01:29:39.017
So it's your fault?

01:29:40.086 --> 01:29:44.022
You don't understand. She was
in shock for years. He disappeared.

01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:47.025
He didn't say good-bye.
He just...

01:29:48.561 --> 01:29:52.327
One day, all of a sudden...

01:29:54.767 --> 01:29:56.359
he was gone.

01:29:58.004 --> 01:30:00.302
He was just hangin' there.

01:30:02.241 --> 01:30:04.732
That's when it all started.

01:30:06.512 --> 01:30:08.639
She used to be so pretty.

01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:14.450
She was so pretty and so fun.

01:30:16.722 --> 01:30:19.418
So you think it's his fault?

01:30:24.831 --> 01:30:28.892
Nobody knew what he felt.
He didn't give anything.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.200
He was just sort of there.

01:30:31.838 --> 01:30:35.274
You'd try to play with him,
you know, get him to play around...

01:30:35.341 --> 01:30:38.504
or get him to laugh
or get him to smile or get him to...

01:30:38.578 --> 01:30:40.808
I don't know... get mad.

01:30:42.715 --> 01:30:45.445
But nothin'.

01:30:47.587 --> 01:30:50.249
Just like he was already dead.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:57.100
I used to know a guy like that.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.100
It's Arnie's birthday.

01:32:34.093 --> 01:32:35.856
I need to go home.

01:33:01.721 --> 01:33:03.313
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:06.000
Give my regards to your mother.

01:33:07.093 --> 01:33:09.994
- Hey, Amy, look who's here.
- Where you been?

01:33:10.062 --> 01:33:11.086
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:33:11.163 --> 01:33:12.528
He's alive.

01:33:35.755 --> 01:33:37.052
Where's Arnie?

01:33:43.596 --> 01:33:44.858
Please, Amy.

01:33:48.667 --> 01:33:50.100
Is he okay?

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.200
I think you better
ask him that yourself.

01:34:01.147 --> 01:34:02.580
Where is he?

01:34:11.323 --> 01:34:13.621
I wonder where he could be.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.900
Have you seen Arnie?

01:34:30.609 --> 01:34:33.237
No, I thought he was with you.

01:34:51.097 --> 01:34:53.031
Anybody seen Arnie?

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.092
Where's my brother?

01:35:16.589 --> 01:35:18.489
Come here.

01:35:18.557 --> 01:35:20.458
You scared me, buddy.

01:35:21.892 --> 01:35:23.325
You scared Gilbert.

01:35:23.394 --> 01:35:25.988
Don't scare Gilbert, okay?

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
- Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Okay.

01:35:45.382 --> 01:35:47.043
Come here.

01:35:47.785 --> 01:35:49.412
Who's got you?

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.200
You better talk to Mama.

01:36:30.661 --> 01:36:32.822
What you did was...

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.600
He's a helpless boy, Gilbert.

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.200
And then disappearing like that?

01:36:50.781 --> 01:36:52.510
I hate that.

01:36:53.784 --> 01:36:55.911
You know how I hate that.

01:36:59.557 --> 01:37:02.219
You walked out, and I thought...

01:37:02.293 --> 01:37:04.454
I can't take another.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.800
But you came back, Gilbert.

01:37:11.201 --> 01:37:12.225
Why?

01:37:13.971 --> 01:37:15.734
Why did you?

01:37:23.847 --> 01:37:25.781
I don't know, Mama.

01:37:27.384 --> 01:37:29.113
I'm here now.

01:37:35.025 --> 01:37:37.357
Yes, you are.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.800
You came back for the party.

01:37:49.206 --> 01:37:53.142
I can't imagine
how it's been for you kids.

01:37:56.013 --> 01:37:58.743
I know what a burden I am.

01:37:58.816 --> 01:38:00.408
Don't say that.

01:38:02.086 --> 01:38:03.576
I know it.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:07.600
And I know that
you're ashamed of me.

01:38:08.859 --> 01:38:10.622
No, I'm not.

01:38:20.838 --> 01:38:25.400
I never, never meant
to be like this.

01:38:27.177 --> 01:38:30.840
I never wanted to be a joke.

01:38:30.914 --> 01:38:32.575
You're no joke, Mama.

01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:36.100
- I never wanted to be.
- You're no joke.

01:38:39.657 --> 01:38:43.684
Please don't disappear.
Please don't disappear.

01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:51.095
Hurry! Hurry!

01:38:51.168 --> 01:38:55.104
You're really growing up to be
quite a young lady.

01:38:55.172 --> 01:38:56.969
- Thanks.
- Hey. Hi.

01:38:59.143 --> 01:39:00.667
You know, I don't want to
rain on the day here...

01:39:00.744 --> 01:39:02.735
but you have a serious
foundation problem.

01:39:02.813 --> 01:39:06.374
You see how the porch is
slanted right here?

01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:10.079
I mean, this is a serious problem.
We need to get up underneath here...

01:39:10.154 --> 01:39:13.351
First of all, we need to fill this
in so no more water collects here.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.100
And then we'll probably...
What?

01:39:23.901 --> 01:39:26.392
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Nana.

01:39:28.706 --> 01:39:31.368
- You ready?
- For what?

01:39:32.376 --> 01:39:35.311
I want you to come meet somebody.

01:39:41.351 --> 01:39:44.684
- Here's your present.
- Arnie, what do you say?

01:39:44.755 --> 01:39:46.347
Thank you!

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.600
Mama, I want you
to meet somebody.

01:40:03.907 --> 01:40:06.239
Please?

01:40:07.311 --> 01:40:09.211
Just this once, for me?

01:40:09.279 --> 01:40:11.509
Gilbert, it's okay.
We can do it later.

01:40:11.582 --> 01:40:14.517
No. This is what I want.

01:40:14.585 --> 01:40:16.951
Do it for me, please?

01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:20.012
This is different.
Nobody's gonna laugh.

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.800
I'm not gonna
hurt you anymore, Mama.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:25.485
I promise.

01:40:26.497 --> 01:40:27.759
Please.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.700
Mama, this is Becky.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.500
I haven't always been like this.

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:06.367
I haven't always been like this.

01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:15.908
- I'm called a miracle.
- You're a miracle?

01:41:15.979 --> 01:41:18.413
- I'm a miracle.
- A walking miracle.

01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:22.600
I can believe that.
I'm just gonna put this up here.

01:41:22.719 --> 01:41:26.314
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Arnie. You take care.

01:41:35.532 --> 01:41:37.659
I had a really nice time.

01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:41.662
I know.

01:41:51.181 --> 01:41:54.878
- I don't know what to say.
- Say "Thank you," Gilbert.

01:41:54.951 --> 01:41:57.112
Say "Thank you."

01:42:06.563 --> 01:42:08.531
Thank you.

01:42:16.473 --> 01:42:20.432
- Good-bye.
- No, it's not good-bye, Arnie.

01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:22.239
It's good night.

01:42:22.312 --> 01:42:25.372
Good night to you, but not me.

01:42:25.448 --> 01:42:27.609
Hey, they're coming!

01:42:27.684 --> 01:42:30.744
Bye! Wait!

01:42:57.747 --> 01:42:59.840
Mama, what are you doing?

01:43:55.105 --> 01:43:57.266
You rest, Mama.

01:43:58.742 --> 01:44:00.676
You deserve to rest.

01:44:04.247 --> 01:44:08.206
Get me my birthday boy.
I want my birthday boy.

01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:11.879
Here, Mama.
Here's the water.

01:44:17.894 --> 01:44:20.362
You're my knight
in shimmering armor.

01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:22.489
Did you know that?

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.800
I think you mean "shining."

01:44:26.569 --> 01:44:30.027
No, "shimmering."

01:44:30.106 --> 01:44:32.438
You shimmer and you glow.

01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:42.413
You rest, okay?

01:44:42.485 --> 01:44:44.419
Get some sleep.

01:45:11.247 --> 01:45:13.579
Wake up!

01:45:15.552 --> 01:45:17.486
You're hiding, huh?

01:45:19.856 --> 01:45:21.585
I know that.

01:45:24.561 --> 01:45:25.994
Wake up!

01:45:28.798 --> 01:45:31.824
Mama, wake up!

01:46:05.068 --> 01:46:08.595
Mama, stop it now!

01:46:08.671 --> 01:46:10.832
Stop, Mama!

01:46:14.277 --> 01:46:15.801
Stop it.

01:46:27.857 --> 01:46:29.620
What's wrong?

01:46:29.692 --> 01:46:31.785
What's wrong? Stop it!

01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:39.100
I'm gonna need
some more men, Amy.

01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:42.731
Hey, flash the lights.
Flash 'em.

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.201
You may need the National Guard
to move her outta there.

01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:49.204
I'm sorry about that.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:03.700
It's gonna take a crane
to get her out.

01:48:07.524 --> 01:48:09.719
There's gonna be a crowd.

01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:14.300
I just know
there's gonna be a crowd.

01:49:23.133 --> 01:49:24.896
She's so beautiful.

01:49:25.969 --> 01:49:27.903
She's no joke.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.700
I'm not gonna let her be a joke.

01:50:05.442 --> 01:50:07.774
We're gonna need your help.

01:53:20.469 --> 01:53:22.937
Gilbert, is that them?

01:53:24.606 --> 01:53:27.097
- No, not yet.
- When are they gonna come?

01:53:27.176 --> 01:53:28.768
Pretty soon.

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:34.400
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 19.

01:53:37.853 --> 01:53:41.084
Gilbert, look there!

01:53:41.156 --> 01:53:43.852
Amy got a job offer
to manage a bakery in Des Moines.

01:53:43.926 --> 01:53:45.450
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's them.

01:53:45.527 --> 01:53:48.291
Ellen can't wait
to switch schools.

01:53:48.364 --> 01:53:50.229
Arnie asked if we were gonna
go too, and I said...

01:53:50.299 --> 01:53:53.325
"Well, we can go anywhere..."

01:53:53.402 --> 01:53:55.370
if we want.

01:53:56.505 --> 01:53:59.440
- "We can go anywhere."
- Becky's comin', huh, Gilbert?

01:53:59.508 --> 01:54:02.636
Yep. She's comin'.

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:07.312
Come on! Come on, Gilbert.

01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:39.670
- How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
