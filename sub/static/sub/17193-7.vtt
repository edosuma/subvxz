00:00.136 --> 00:03.005
I'm engaged.
To miss Mary Lockwood.

00:03.007 --> 00:04.973
Grindle kept
a ledger, listed every woman

00:04.975 --> 00:06.475
who needed her service and
every man who paid for it.

00:06.477 --> 00:07.643
How much?

00:07.645 --> 00:08.844
Where is Annie?

00:08.846 --> 00:11.113
I sent her away

00:11.115 --> 00:12.981
to live with a family
in California.

00:12.983 --> 00:14.249
Hello, girl.

00:14.251 --> 00:16.117
He's not my father.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.287
I'll behave!
Please! No!

01:19.102 --> 01:22.404
What are you
humming?

01:22.406 --> 01:25.240
Am I?

01:25.242 --> 01:28.677
I had no idea.

01:28.679 --> 01:31.880
Why, detective Corcoran,
you seem...

01:31.882 --> 01:34.249
Very pleasantly
surprised?

01:34.251 --> 01:37.119
I'm not.

01:37.121 --> 01:40.092
I'm not surprised
at all.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.426
Come back over here
and let me see

01:44.428 --> 01:45.928
what I can do
about that.

01:50.467 --> 01:51.967
Bring me a glass.

01:51.969 --> 01:55.304
A man finds himself
in ironed sheets,

01:55.306 --> 01:57.372
he needs a bit of crystal
with his drink.

02:03.213 --> 02:05.581
Propose a toast.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.516
To Annie.

02:08.686 --> 02:12.521
Where is she,
again?

02:12.523 --> 02:14.923
Kevin,

02:14.925 --> 02:18.961
how many times
must we go over this?

02:21.799 --> 02:25.834
Where
in California?

02:25.836 --> 02:28.637
Outside
San Francisco,

02:28.639 --> 02:30.472
with a respectable
family,

02:30.474 --> 02:32.541
in a home
with ocean views,

02:32.543 --> 02:34.243
views that
would calm

02:34.245 --> 02:36.645
the most agitated
of spirits.

02:42.151 --> 02:45.954
That seems far
enough away, then.

02:45.956 --> 02:48.524
Far enough away
from Five Points?

02:48.526 --> 02:50.025
Far enough away
from the man

02:50.027 --> 02:52.494
who took her innocence
in the first place...

02:52.496 --> 02:55.597
a farmer north
of the city,

02:55.599 --> 02:56.832
named Reilly.

02:56.834 --> 02:59.101
He, uh,

02:59.103 --> 03:01.904
he forced Annie
to live as his wife,

03:01.906 --> 03:05.507
all the while claiming
to be her father.

03:05.509 --> 03:06.842
Her father?

03:06.844 --> 03:10.512
What's important is
that she's safe.

03:10.514 --> 03:13.815
With hope, happiness,
following.

03:18.655 --> 03:20.556
Pour me a drink.

03:20.558 --> 03:24.493
Quickly.

03:24.495 --> 03:25.794
Confederate agents

03:25.796 --> 03:27.296
crossed the border
from Canada

03:27.298 --> 03:29.264
and raided the town of
St. Albans, Vermont,

03:29.266 --> 03:31.333
robbing banks,
burning buildings.

03:31.335 --> 03:33.068
One man is dead.

03:33.070 --> 03:34.570
Take this telegram
to my father,

03:34.572 --> 03:36.071
given that he thinks

03:36.073 --> 03:37.973
the war will never find
its way to his door.

03:37.975 --> 03:39.408
Yes, sir.

03:39.410 --> 03:41.610
You should go up
to Newport

03:41.612 --> 03:43.111
or out
to Hyde park.

03:43.113 --> 03:45.414
The situation
can't be that dire.

03:45.416 --> 03:47.282
The telegram
suggests

03:47.284 --> 03:48.951
there are nested
confederate spies

03:48.953 --> 03:51.987
in Cincinnati, Baltimore,
Philadelphia,

03:51.989 --> 03:55.958
and New York.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.293
If you think Lincoln
cares about our city

03:58.295 --> 04:00.562
any more than he does
that town in Vermont,

04:00.564 --> 04:02.064
I got a bar o' soap
to sell you,

04:02.066 --> 04:03.899
might have
a gold coin in it.

04:05.135 --> 04:06.902
Abe's too busy
with his big feet up,

04:06.904 --> 04:08.870
lazing with his cronies
in the parlor

04:08.872 --> 04:10.372
of the white house,
as his war takes

04:10.374 --> 04:11.873
our fathers, sons,
and brothers.

04:11.875 --> 04:15.277
Good morning, Sybil.
Detective.

04:15.279 --> 04:16.511
Hear, hear!

04:16.512 --> 04:18.213
We got rebels spies
among us

04:18.214 --> 04:20.449
who wish us harm.

04:22.017 --> 04:24.820
I say,
let's step up

04:24.822 --> 04:26.888
and tell Mr. Lincoln
this war needs

04:26.890 --> 04:28.991
to stop, now!

04:28.993 --> 04:30.492
Before his inaction
causes the loss

04:30.494 --> 04:31.960
of more
New York lives.

04:31.962 --> 04:35.564
Right.
Well put.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.866
Strong words, sir.
Thank you, sir.

04:37.868 --> 04:41.236
What's this, then,
you spooked?

04:41.238 --> 04:44.239
I'm not spooked.

04:44.241 --> 04:45.741
Only, maybe it's time
we take my sister up

04:45.743 --> 04:47.676
on her offer,
head out to Kentucky.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.945
C'mere, c'mere.

04:49.947 --> 04:51.847
I'll protect you.

04:51.849 --> 04:53.348
Feels like you
got something else

04:53.350 --> 04:54.850
on your mind,
besides protecting me.

04:54.852 --> 04:56.284
Well, I can do
two things at once.

04:56.286 --> 04:58.420
That'll be the day.

04:59.823 --> 05:01.256
Settle down,
now, mister.

05:01.258 --> 05:02.691
You stay
where you are

05:02.693 --> 05:03.959
and you shut
yourself up,

05:03.961 --> 05:05.427
you want to make it back
to the city alive.

05:05.429 --> 05:07.262
I only want
to speak with Annie.

05:07.264 --> 05:09.164
Hmm!

05:09.166 --> 05:10.932
Now, you ain't
on Fifth Avenue now.

05:10.934 --> 05:13.068
I will involve
the police.

05:13.070 --> 05:14.569
Be my guest.

05:14.571 --> 05:16.171
I'd like
to tell them

05:16.173 --> 05:18.040
what your husband
did to her.

05:18.042 --> 05:19.174
Hmm?

05:19.176 --> 05:21.510
Mrs. Haverford,
please, get in.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.554
Come on, now,
get up.

05:36.626 --> 05:39.561
We welcome Mr. Kennedy,
a representative

05:39.563 --> 05:42.798
of the new coalition
government up in Canada.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.199
He's here to discuss
strategies

05:44.201 --> 05:47.836
to increase business
opportunities and profits.

05:47.838 --> 05:49.104
Mr. Kennedy.

05:49.106 --> 05:52.074
Thank
you, mayor Gunther.

05:52.076 --> 05:54.242
First, I would like
to say that

05:54.244 --> 05:55.744
we in Ottawa

05:55.746 --> 05:59.247
are united in our deep
sadness regarding

05:59.249 --> 06:01.817
the events
at St. Albans.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.318
If there is anything
that we can do

06:03.320 --> 06:06.888
to ensure the security
of your fine city,

06:06.890 --> 06:08.590
then we are
at your disposal.

06:08.592 --> 06:10.258
Close the border.

06:10.260 --> 06:12.394
Keep confederate spies
from sneaking into America.

06:12.396 --> 06:13.895
Close the border?

06:13.897 --> 06:15.397
What, and
restrict trade?

06:15.399 --> 06:17.466
Obviously,

06:17.468 --> 06:19.968
I don't advocate
disrupting imports

06:19.970 --> 06:24.239
and exports between
our great nations, but,

06:24.241 --> 06:27.109
for three years,
your harbor has launched

06:27.111 --> 06:29.845
union ships that have
blockaded Southern ports,

06:29.847 --> 06:32.147
successfully smothering
the confederate economy.

06:32.149 --> 06:34.616
By doing this,
New York

06:34.618 --> 06:38.320
has made itself
a primary target.

06:38.322 --> 06:40.489
Do you have any specific
information regarding

06:40.491 --> 06:41.857
rebs and
Southern sympathizers

06:41.859 --> 06:43.592
in our midst?

06:43.594 --> 06:45.026
My son
shares the views

06:45.028 --> 06:46.461
of street-corner
alarmists.

06:48.031 --> 06:50.332
New York is a pillar of
business in north America.

06:50.334 --> 06:51.833
It always has been,
always will be,

06:51.835 --> 06:54.202
and the business,
at present, is war.

06:54.204 --> 06:56.972
Even in divisive times,
on this point,

06:56.974 --> 06:59.441
all agree,
north and South.

06:59.443 --> 07:00.942
Still, you are some

07:00.944 --> 07:03.378
of the wealthiest men
in America,

07:03.380 --> 07:05.680
y'all have the power
to influence Washington.

07:05.682 --> 07:07.182
A loosening
of the blockade

07:07.184 --> 07:10.018
would put your city
at less risk.

07:10.020 --> 07:11.987
A very peculiar accent,
Mr. Kennedy.

07:11.989 --> 07:15.557
I was born and raised
in trois-rivières.

07:15.559 --> 07:17.192
Ever heard of it?

07:17.194 --> 07:18.193
No.

07:18.195 --> 07:19.661
That's because
no one

07:19.663 --> 07:23.131
outside of trois-rivières
would ever need to.

07:32.475 --> 07:34.476
Mary.

07:48.357 --> 07:51.860
Mary.

07:51.862 --> 07:54.996
I've got a surprise
for you.

07:54.998 --> 07:56.498
I've tickets to see

07:56.500 --> 07:58.600
the smallest man in the
world, at Barnum's.

07:58.602 --> 08:00.502
Leave me.

08:00.504 --> 08:03.705
What's the matter?

08:03.707 --> 08:05.207
Leave me alone.

08:07.910 --> 08:10.378
Who did this
to you?

08:10.380 --> 08:11.546
Who?

08:11.548 --> 08:13.315
Can't you just
let me be?

08:13.317 --> 08:15.917
Every time I turn
around, you're there.

08:15.919 --> 08:17.686
For five minutes,
just let me be!

08:17.688 --> 08:19.054
Just...
please!

08:19.056 --> 08:22.023
I said,
just let me be.

08:36.772 --> 08:39.174
Hey, boy.

08:39.176 --> 08:42.110
Why you running?
Relax now, child.

08:42.111 --> 08:44.078
You're all right.

08:44.081 --> 08:45.747
You know miss Mary?

08:45.749 --> 08:47.716
Yeah.
She your teacher?

08:47.718 --> 08:50.051
See something bad,
did you?

08:50.053 --> 08:51.553
He was
beating her.

08:51.555 --> 08:53.054
Mr. McLean.

08:53.056 --> 08:55.624
Mclean?

08:55.626 --> 08:56.858
Jeremiah McLean?

08:56.860 --> 08:58.026
Yeah.

09:02.598 --> 09:04.399
Out of me way!
Sim!

09:04.401 --> 09:05.834
Where's your man
McLean?

09:05.836 --> 09:07.669
I don't know.

09:07.671 --> 09:09.170
He always seems
to wander off

09:09.172 --> 09:10.672
when new stock
comes in.

09:10.674 --> 09:12.140
Tell him
I want to see him.

09:12.142 --> 09:15.076
I will,
detective.

09:15.078 --> 09:17.646
Do you want me
to tell him why?

09:17.648 --> 09:19.347
Yeah, to discuss

09:19.349 --> 09:23.251
the proper way
to treat a lady.

09:23.253 --> 09:26.054
This is
your nightstick.

09:26.056 --> 09:27.289
It's for crooks.

09:27.291 --> 09:29.524
Don't be using it on
inoffensive citizens.

09:29.526 --> 09:31.860
And, if you do, don't
hit 'em in the head.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.062
The insane asylum's <i>full</i>
<i>of skull fractures.</i>

09:34.064 --> 09:35.297
Yes, sir.

09:35.299 --> 09:39.267
Now, little Byrnes,
be sure to remember all

09:39.269 --> 09:41.336
of detective O'Brien's
teachings.

09:41.338 --> 09:42.837
Don't want to be
killing yourself

09:42.839 --> 09:44.339
on account of some
cussed fruit cake,

09:44.341 --> 09:45.840
like your Uncle
did, do you?

09:45.842 --> 09:47.676
Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir.

09:47.678 --> 09:49.110
You're in
a playful mood.

09:49.112 --> 09:51.146
How could I
not be?

09:51.148 --> 09:53.515
It's a beautiful
fall day.

09:53.517 --> 09:57.218
Just smell the air.

09:57.220 --> 09:59.454
You smell
of rosewater.

09:59.456 --> 10:01.056
I know.

10:04.661 --> 10:06.928
Well, don't that
beat the Dutch.

10:14.904 --> 10:16.338
Did Asa bring the mail
from the station?

10:16.340 --> 10:21.042
Ah. The laudanum
should've arrived.

10:21.044 --> 10:22.911
Not much I can do
for Mr. Morgan,

10:22.913 --> 10:24.412
except lessen
the pain

10:24.414 --> 10:25.914
when the end
finally comes.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.850
Well, he's lived
a long, hard life.

10:28.852 --> 10:30.352
You look peaked.

10:30.354 --> 10:32.654
Oh, I'm fine.

10:32.656 --> 10:34.255
Did you eat enough
this morning?

10:34.257 --> 10:35.590
I ate 'til
I was full.

10:35.592 --> 10:37.192
Hmm.

10:40.163 --> 10:41.396
Sara?

10:41.398 --> 10:43.098
Sara?

10:43.100 --> 10:45.533
Baby, okay.
Okay. Okay.

11:16.065 --> 11:17.298
You hungry?

11:17.300 --> 11:21.136
If you say so,
sir.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.741
I brought you
some bacon.

11:26.743 --> 11:29.344
Thank you.

11:41.123 --> 11:43.958
Thank you, sir.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.295
You can thank me
after you're done.

11:47.297 --> 11:50.398
Um, I can
thank you before,

11:50.400 --> 11:53.768
if you like.

11:53.770 --> 11:57.072
I could show you some
of the things

11:57.074 --> 12:00.175
my fancy friends
showed me.

13:01.837 --> 13:03.204
Let's go, then.

13:29.098 --> 13:30.098
Ahh!

13:33.302 --> 13:34.302
Ah!

13:40.709 --> 13:45.180
Ahhh!

13:48.351 --> 13:50.552
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

14:03.137 --> 14:04.570
Kevin.

14:04.572 --> 14:05.738
Kevin!

14:09.244 --> 14:11.344
Please
don't kick me out.

14:11.346 --> 14:12.678
I'm so tired.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.447
I've been walking
for Miles.

14:14.449 --> 14:16.349
Annie. Annie, how did
you...? When did...?

14:16.351 --> 14:17.517
No, no, no,
don't touch me.

14:17.519 --> 14:19.385
It's okay.
It's okay.

14:19.387 --> 14:21.687
I killed Mr. Reilly.

14:21.689 --> 14:24.257
Did he follow you
to California?

14:24.259 --> 14:27.960
He had me chained to
his barn like a hound.

14:27.962 --> 14:29.729
He... he did
those things to me,

14:29.731 --> 14:31.264
over and over.

14:31.266 --> 14:34.000
I'm going to hang, Kevin!
I'm going to hang!

14:34.002 --> 14:35.501
No, no one's
going to hang you.

14:35.503 --> 14:38.104
No one's going to
hang, child.

14:38.106 --> 14:39.672
No one's
going to hang.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.774
I should've killed
the man myself,

14:41.776 --> 14:43.576
when I had
the chance.

14:43.578 --> 14:46.445
How... how did he
find you?

14:46.447 --> 14:48.347
Mrs. Haverford

14:48.349 --> 14:49.849
gave me to him.

14:49.851 --> 14:54.587
Hold me.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.122
Hold me...

14:59.093 --> 15:01.661
I swear,
I don't know

15:01.663 --> 15:05.131
if I'm feverish
or freezing.

15:05.133 --> 15:08.801
Oh, please,
tell me everything's

15:08.803 --> 15:10.436
going to be
all right, Kevin.

15:11.773 --> 15:15.174
Even if
it won't.

15:15.176 --> 15:19.278
Even
if it won't.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.981
What's wrong
with me?

15:21.983 --> 15:25.218
Well, I did a thorough
examination

15:25.220 --> 15:27.587
while you were
asleep and noticed

15:27.589 --> 15:30.056
a little bleeding
in your undergarments.

15:30.058 --> 15:31.757
Well, now is
not your time

15:31.759 --> 15:35.094
and your breasts
are a little swollen.

15:35.096 --> 15:36.896
And, well...

15:36.898 --> 15:39.866
Matthew, are you
saying that I'm...?

15:39.868 --> 15:41.567
Pregnant.
Pregnant.

15:43.271 --> 15:44.537
But how?

15:44.539 --> 15:46.639
Well, I don't need to
explain that, now, do I?

15:46.641 --> 15:48.140
You know
what I mean.

15:51.379 --> 15:53.746
Baby, I don't
feel right.

15:53.748 --> 15:56.249
Well, that's just
morning sickness,

15:56.251 --> 15:59.485
you know, that's...
it's a saying, but,

15:59.487 --> 16:02.855
you can feel lopsided
any time of the day.

16:02.857 --> 16:04.957
Sara,

16:04.959 --> 16:08.327
you and I, we're
going to have a child.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.608
Mclean.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.944
Detective Maguire.

16:24.946 --> 16:26.679
I heard you
stopped in earlier.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.214
Just closing up.

16:28.216 --> 16:30.383
Why'd you hit her?!
Mary Lockwood.

16:30.385 --> 16:32.919
Ain't your business,
Maguire.

16:32.921 --> 16:34.654
I don't need a copper to
take care of my problems.

16:34.656 --> 16:36.155
I got fists
of my own!

16:36.157 --> 16:37.657
She a problem
to you, is she?

16:37.659 --> 16:39.191
Sure as shit,
she is!

16:47.034 --> 16:49.502
Why'd you hit her?

16:49.504 --> 16:51.270
Christ.

16:51.272 --> 16:53.306
It's that
goddamn ledger!

16:53.308 --> 16:54.540
Her sister's.

16:54.542 --> 16:58.644
She's got madame
Grindle's ledger.

16:58.646 --> 17:00.680
Ahh! Ah!

17:01.916 --> 17:05.384
Mary Lockwood's been
blackmailing me.

17:05.386 --> 17:06.886
The hag's been
blackmailing

17:06.887 --> 17:09.454
all the men who paid
Grindle for abortions.

17:14.627 --> 17:17.363
Mary!

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
Mary!

17:21.502 --> 17:24.603
Mary!

17:25.740 --> 17:30.009
Open this
goddamn door!

17:45.660 --> 17:48.260
Robert.

17:48.262 --> 17:50.463
It's late, I know.
I'm sorry.

17:50.465 --> 17:51.964
Nonsense.

17:51.966 --> 17:54.333
It's always a pleasure
to be in your company.

17:54.335 --> 17:55.601
Hmm.

17:55.603 --> 17:57.103
Shall we sit?

17:57.105 --> 17:58.904
No, your man's
at work in there.

17:58.906 --> 18:02.541
This matters requires
a little privacy.

18:02.543 --> 18:04.210
What's wrong?

18:07.047 --> 18:08.781
I need you to speak
with Kevin.

18:08.783 --> 18:09.882
Concerning?

18:09.884 --> 18:12.251
I lied to him.

18:12.253 --> 18:15.087
People lie
to him all the time.

18:15.089 --> 18:16.589
He's quite used
to it.

18:16.591 --> 18:18.090
A fellow named Reilly
came to me

18:18.092 --> 18:20.393
and announced that
he was Annie's father.

18:20.395 --> 18:22.094
I allowed him
to take the girl.

18:22.096 --> 18:23.729
I see no trouble
there.

18:23.731 --> 18:25.698
I told Kevin that I'd
sent her elsewhere,

18:25.700 --> 18:27.133
to San Francisco.

18:27.135 --> 18:28.634
I don't know why I lied,
but the words

18:28.636 --> 18:30.136
just came out
of my mouth

18:30.138 --> 18:31.570
and I couldn't
pull them back.

18:31.572 --> 18:33.305
Maybe I knew instinctively
that I shouldn't have

18:33.307 --> 18:35.341
permitted Reilly
to take Annie with him.

18:35.343 --> 18:36.942
Elizabeth...
no, you don't see!

18:36.944 --> 18:41.147
Reilly is not the man
he claims to be.

18:41.149 --> 18:44.383
I went upstate to try
and retrieve her, but...

18:44.385 --> 18:47.820
oh, Robert.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.622
This time, the look
in his eyes,

18:49.624 --> 18:51.357
it was beastly.

18:51.359 --> 18:53.292
You have to
help me.

18:53.294 --> 18:54.794
You must speak
with Kevin.

18:54.796 --> 18:56.295
You know him
so well.

18:56.297 --> 18:57.797
Well enough
to know that

18:57.799 --> 18:59.698
you must tell him
yourself.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.201
I'm not sure
that I can.

19:02.203 --> 19:05.304
You must, and soon.

19:05.306 --> 19:07.173
Corky's like
a mad dog...

19:07.175 --> 19:08.674
the longer he chews
on a bone,

19:08.676 --> 19:10.576
the sharper
his teeth get.

19:25.793 --> 19:27.126
Kevin?

19:32.632 --> 19:33.799
Kevin?

19:39.539 --> 19:42.408
Kevin?

19:43.644 --> 19:45.144
I don't have to
tell you

19:45.146 --> 19:46.879
how many bastards
out there would rather

19:46.881 --> 19:48.481
kill a copper
than steal a dollar.

19:48.483 --> 19:49.648
Andrew.

19:49.650 --> 19:50.983
Sybil, meet...
I was across the street

19:50.985 --> 19:53.018
at Elek's butcher shop
just moments ago.

19:53.020 --> 19:55.654
Mrs. Reardon told me that
Mrs. McDonagh told her that

19:55.656 --> 19:57.656
there's a secret telegram
from secretary of state seward

19:57.658 --> 19:59.792
to mayor Gunther, warning of
a rebel invasion of Manhattan.

19:59.794 --> 20:01.360
If so, we're all
going to die.

20:01.362 --> 20:02.761
Hmm.

20:02.763 --> 20:04.763
Andrew, I want you
to find out the truth.

20:04.765 --> 20:07.133
Well, how am I
to do that?

20:07.135 --> 20:08.834
The mayor and I don't
drink in the same saloons.

20:08.836 --> 20:10.302
Ahh!

20:10.304 --> 20:12.471
You're a detective! Get up off
your arse and start detecting.

20:12.473 --> 20:15.975
Or don't come home.

20:17.278 --> 20:19.345
Is she always
like that?

20:19.347 --> 20:21.313
Oh, yeah,
pretty much.

20:24.518 --> 20:26.652
One mine less
of gum syrup

20:26.654 --> 20:28.921
with half a pony glass
of curaçao

20:28.923 --> 20:30.356
poured over ice.

20:30.358 --> 20:33.292
If you don't
have any,

20:33.294 --> 20:34.660
give the glass
into the hands

20:34.662 --> 20:37.463
of a coldhearted
bitch like me.

20:37.465 --> 20:39.498
Top it
with a cherry.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.468
That's where
my girls come in.

20:42.470 --> 20:44.570
You've transformed
this place, Eva.

20:44.572 --> 20:46.772
Let me
sit, darling.

20:46.774 --> 20:48.374
I don't care how much
French perfume

20:48.376 --> 20:49.875
miss Pompadou
used to spritz around,

20:49.877 --> 20:52.077
that bitch
still smelled

20:52.079 --> 20:53.479
like the new Jersey
swamp she was born in.

20:55.850 --> 20:57.917
To Eva, bringing
a little gravitas

20:57.919 --> 20:59.985
to our palace
of pleasure.

20:59.987 --> 21:01.854
<i>Prost.</i>

21:01.856 --> 21:04.190
Here's to peace at home
and peace abroad,

21:04.192 --> 21:06.759
to love our wife
and to love a broad.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.798
I'll drink to that.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.033
Pascale,

21:14.035 --> 21:17.002
ask our bartender
to open Eva's

21:17.004 --> 21:19.271
new book of cocktails
randomly and,

21:19.273 --> 21:20.839
whichever page
he lands on,

21:20.841 --> 21:23.542
have him mix three
and bring them over.

21:23.544 --> 21:29.615
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

21:29.617 --> 21:30.616
Mmm.

21:30.618 --> 21:31.617
Ahh!

21:31.619 --> 21:33.118
I haven't heard
a toast like that

21:33.120 --> 21:35.187
since I was South
of the Mason-Dixon.

21:35.189 --> 21:39.792
Ah, well, before
public service,

21:39.794 --> 21:41.727
I was in the
cotton business.

21:41.729 --> 21:46.065
I used to venture do
to Atlanta quite often.

21:46.067 --> 21:49.201
Sweet Atlanta,

21:49.203 --> 21:54.840
a city close
to my heart.

21:54.842 --> 21:56.342
But, as you know,

21:56.344 --> 21:59.245
Montreal does have
the best cathouses.

21:59.247 --> 22:01.981
One in particular.

22:01.983 --> 22:04.216
To Robespierre's,

22:04.218 --> 22:06.518
the finest brothel
in all of north America!

22:06.520 --> 22:09.455
Indeed!
To Robespierre's.

22:09.457 --> 22:10.456
Robespierre's!

22:10.458 --> 22:13.926
Oh, the women
of Robespierre's.

22:13.928 --> 22:17.229
Every single one is
queen of the may.

22:17.231 --> 22:19.031
I couldn't
agree more.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.500
I swear, I once caught
sight of God himself

22:21.502 --> 22:24.703
in that place
and he was smiling.

22:29.976 --> 22:32.945
Oh, I do miss
Atlanta, though.

22:32.947 --> 22:35.414
A fine city.

22:35.416 --> 22:37.683
Before the war.

22:37.685 --> 22:42.021
Now, the people,
their spirit lost.

22:46.693 --> 22:48.961
I don't blame
the South for this.

22:50.197 --> 22:53.299
I blame that babbling
ape in the white house.

22:53.301 --> 22:55.968
Not-so-honest
Abe Lincoln!

22:55.970 --> 22:57.469
He's the one
who cost me my leg.

22:57.471 --> 22:59.538
Why don't we get some
more girls over here?

22:59.540 --> 23:01.473
No, the South

23:01.475 --> 23:03.509
has just as much right
to be free from the union

23:03.511 --> 23:06.478
as the 13 colonies had
to be free from england!

23:06.480 --> 23:08.714
Oh, Lincoln clutches

23:08.716 --> 23:10.449
to this...
this phantom nation

23:10.451 --> 23:13.352
that never existed
and never will.

23:13.354 --> 23:15.954
I say,

23:15.956 --> 23:18.924
equal
and separate.

24:19.705 --> 24:21.339
I told Mr. Morgan
I'd give him a call.

24:21.341 --> 24:23.341
I hope to not be more
than a few hours, Sara.

24:23.343 --> 24:24.842
Would you stop
your worrying.

24:24.844 --> 24:26.344
It's not as if I'll be
moving furniture

24:26.346 --> 24:27.845
while you're gone.

24:27.847 --> 24:30.815
I'll try not to worry,
but I can't promise.

24:36.356 --> 24:37.855
How do you do,
Asa?

24:37.857 --> 24:39.924
Fine. Dr. Freeman,
I've...

24:39.926 --> 24:41.893
oh, just take that
to Sara.

24:41.895 --> 24:44.562
Got to run off.
Give your mama my best.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.468
Hello, Mrs. Freeman.
Walk on.

24:50.470 --> 24:51.936
How you do, Asa?
What's this?

24:51.938 --> 24:54.238
A white man in town
made me take this

24:54.240 --> 24:55.974
and told me to show it
to all of our kind.

25:16.695 --> 25:19.797
The word's all over
the Five Points...

25:19.799 --> 25:21.766
a secret telegram
warning

25:21.768 --> 25:23.634
of the destruction
of New York.

25:23.636 --> 25:26.537
Ridiculous.

25:26.539 --> 25:29.140
There's no truth
to it, is there?

25:29.142 --> 25:31.876
I can't comment
on whether or not

25:31.878 --> 25:33.711
such a telegram
exists.

25:33.713 --> 25:35.113
Wait,
there is one?

25:35.115 --> 25:36.614
Rest assured that
the city fathers have

25:36.616 --> 25:40.118
taken all these matters
into consideration

25:40.120 --> 25:41.986
and determined that
there is no threat.

25:41.988 --> 25:43.721
All right, but how
do we know for sure?

25:43.723 --> 25:46.891
Detective! Yours is
not to reason why.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.860
Yours is to shut up
and get out.

25:48.862 --> 25:51.629
Yes, sir.

25:56.368 --> 25:57.535
Ahem.

26:14.820 --> 26:17.422
This is what Asa
brought this morning.

26:17.424 --> 26:19.123
A man, a white man,
was handing those out

26:19.125 --> 26:20.625
to black folk,
telling them

26:20.627 --> 26:23.928
they'd better
pass them around.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.530
Asa said that
the man told him

26:25.532 --> 26:28.099
that those were
a warning to go back.

26:28.101 --> 26:30.501
Back where,

26:30.503 --> 26:33.504
Matthew?

26:37.042 --> 26:39.477
How can we bring
a child into this?

26:48.287 --> 26:51.489
There is a darkness
in this world, Sara.

26:51.491 --> 26:55.293
I won't deny that.

26:55.295 --> 26:57.528
We, both of us,

26:57.530 --> 27:01.866
we've been touched
by it.

27:01.868 --> 27:05.470
And I know
that there are

27:05.472 --> 27:09.841
times when I feel
lost in it.

27:09.843 --> 27:15.246
And in those times,
I feel for us.

27:15.248 --> 27:17.815
But this child,
Sara,

27:17.817 --> 27:19.884
our child will be
a light,

27:19.886 --> 27:22.487
it'll be a beacon,

27:22.489 --> 27:24.322
burning that
darkness away.

27:30.496 --> 27:32.396
Are you sure?

27:32.398 --> 27:35.533
As sure as I am
that I love you.

27:44.443 --> 27:48.946
Those scars
on your chest.

27:48.948 --> 27:50.948
I'm lucky,
in a way.

27:50.950 --> 27:52.917
One thing about
losing a leg is

27:52.919 --> 27:54.418
the enemy doesn't
carry you

27:54.420 --> 27:58.789
off the battlefield,
into a prison.

27:58.791 --> 28:03.694
They leave you
to die.

28:06.065 --> 28:10.334
There is no brothel
named robespierre

28:10.336 --> 28:11.669
in Montreal.

28:24.116 --> 28:25.783
I was held

28:25.785 --> 28:29.053
in a union prison

28:29.055 --> 28:34.692
on Johnson's island,
outside sandusky.

28:34.694 --> 28:37.094
Frostbite
in the winter;

28:37.096 --> 28:39.330
Scurvy, dysentery,
all year.

28:39.332 --> 28:42.633
There was
no medicine,

28:42.635 --> 28:45.469
no food.

28:45.471 --> 28:47.605
We ate rats.

28:47.607 --> 28:49.473
One time,

28:49.475 --> 28:52.376
a guard's dog.

28:52.378 --> 28:55.613
Tasted like mutton.

29:04.790 --> 29:06.857
The fine people
of sandusky

29:06.859 --> 29:10.328
would pay 10 cents

29:10.330 --> 29:12.263
to be rowed across
the Ohio river

29:12.265 --> 29:15.233
to watch
our sufferings.

29:15.235 --> 29:22.740
I tried to escape, got
hung up by my thumbs.

29:22.742 --> 29:24.875
That's what the race
traitor Lincoln

29:24.877 --> 29:27.778
did to me,

29:27.780 --> 29:31.916
to my family's
good name.

29:31.918 --> 29:38.055
A man's name
is all he has.

29:38.057 --> 29:42.026
How can I help you
reclaim your own?

29:53.305 --> 29:55.940
We have associates
in Manhattan

29:55.942 --> 29:58.843
that are waiting
and ready.

29:58.845 --> 30:02.213
If McClellan wins the
presidential election,

30:02.215 --> 30:04.181
then we retreat.

30:04.183 --> 30:05.683
We've been assured

30:05.685 --> 30:09.120
that he will recognize
the confederacy.

30:09.122 --> 30:14.458
But if Lincoln wins,
New York will burn.

30:14.460 --> 30:18.696
New York's
burnt before.

30:18.698 --> 30:20.598
She always
comes back.

30:20.600 --> 30:25.469
Not this time.

30:25.471 --> 30:28.406
Would you like
to see why?

30:28.408 --> 30:31.142
This ain't
bayou moonshine.

30:55.901 --> 30:59.036
Look at that, a flame
without a match.

30:59.038 --> 31:01.272
Very impressive.

31:07.979 --> 31:11.048
It'll cost, but,
in a few days,

31:11.050 --> 31:12.583
we'll have enough
to burn Manhattan

31:12.585 --> 31:15.152
from the bowery
to Washington Square.

31:17.156 --> 31:18.723
Put it out, boys.

31:32.804 --> 31:34.271
Sorry about
your carriage.

31:34.273 --> 31:37.241
No need.

31:37.243 --> 31:38.576
Noble cause.

31:38.578 --> 31:41.045
And I'll blame it
on my drink.

31:42.281 --> 31:43.781
Let's go back
inside.

31:43.783 --> 31:45.282
I have a particular
gin that has

31:45.284 --> 31:47.785
a very similar effect
on the throat.

32:04.236 --> 32:07.538
Kevin,

32:07.540 --> 32:10.141
where have you
been?

32:10.143 --> 32:12.810
Away.

32:12.812 --> 32:15.646
I looked for you.

32:15.648 --> 32:18.949
Which of the two
is more expensive?

32:18.951 --> 32:20.451
Well, that's
a Thomas Cole.

32:20.453 --> 32:22.920
I asked which is
more expensive.

32:22.922 --> 32:24.989
The nude.

32:24.991 --> 32:26.157
Kevin...

32:26.159 --> 32:27.858
and now, huh?! How much
is it worth now?

32:27.860 --> 32:29.527
Stop it!

32:29.529 --> 32:31.362
And now?!
How much is it worth?

32:31.364 --> 32:34.532
Kevin, stop it!

32:34.534 --> 32:36.033
I know what
you did to Annie.

32:36.035 --> 32:38.502
Let me explain.

32:38.504 --> 32:41.071
You lied to me.
To <i>me.</i>

32:41.073 --> 32:43.441
If anything happens
to Annie, I will cut you!

32:44.677 --> 32:46.110
Right across
your voicebox,

32:46.112 --> 32:47.545
and you
can scream,

32:47.547 --> 32:49.713
but no one's
going to hear you.

32:49.715 --> 32:52.183
You understand me?

32:52.185 --> 32:53.684
Do you
understand me?

32:53.686 --> 32:55.553
Yes. Yes.

32:55.555 --> 32:56.787
Do you?!

32:56.789 --> 32:58.122
Ye-yes!

33:04.959 --> 33:07.060
I didn't think I would
see much of you anymore.

33:07.943 --> 33:10.110
Not with
your new friend,

33:10.112 --> 33:12.012
Mrs. Haverford.

33:12.014 --> 33:15.615
Far from a friend.

33:15.617 --> 33:19.419
She...

33:19.421 --> 33:21.288
she gave Annie back
to John Reilly.

33:40.141 --> 33:42.309
Society women don't
concern themselves

33:42.311 --> 33:44.077
with a man's
character.

33:44.079 --> 33:46.646
All these ladies
think about

33:46.648 --> 33:49.382
are ribbons and
feathers and bows.

33:49.384 --> 33:52.018
She lied to me,

33:52.020 --> 33:54.454
made me
believe her.

33:54.456 --> 33:56.690
She handed Annie over
like a piece of meat,

33:56.692 --> 33:58.992
bought and sold,
traded and...

33:58.994 --> 34:03.797
traded and stored.

34:03.799 --> 34:07.367
I would've slit
her throat.

34:07.369 --> 34:09.202
You do
know me well.

34:26.786 --> 34:29.589
No. I got to
get home.

34:30.826 --> 34:34.494
I don't want Annie alone
there for the night.

34:34.496 --> 34:35.996
Mrs. McDonagh is
looking after her,

34:35.998 --> 34:38.931
but she can't keep her
eyes open past 8:00.

34:38.934 --> 34:42.435
Do me a favor
before you go?

34:42.437 --> 34:44.638
Ask.

34:44.639 --> 34:47.040
Your pal
Maguire's here,

34:47.042 --> 34:48.641
since late
last night.

34:48.643 --> 34:50.909
I locked him in one
of the rooms.

34:50.911 --> 34:52.411
He has been
wallpapered nonstop,

34:52.414 --> 34:53.847
howling for Molly.

34:53.849 --> 34:56.116
Get him out.

34:56.118 --> 34:59.119
<i>Dry</i> him out.

34:59.121 --> 35:00.620
Then, I will come by
tomorrow night

35:00.622 --> 35:02.856
and show you
how well I know you.

35:27.682 --> 35:30.550
Putting one on,
are we?

35:30.552 --> 35:31.718
Aye.

35:31.720 --> 35:35.789
Drowning
the shamrock.

35:37.392 --> 35:38.958
Hey! This is
a whorehouse.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.460
People are trying
to concentrate.

35:40.462 --> 35:41.995
Sometimes at night,

35:41.997 --> 35:45.165
I stop by
the cemetery

35:45.167 --> 35:48.568
to talk to her,

35:48.570 --> 35:50.136
to Molly.

35:50.138 --> 35:52.038
She do
any talking back?

35:59.114 --> 36:02.048
Something's
not right

36:02.050 --> 36:06.753
about the way
she died.

36:06.755 --> 36:08.421
Not right at all.

36:08.423 --> 36:10.123
Death is never
right, Francis.

36:10.125 --> 36:12.859
The losses are
adding up.

36:16.731 --> 36:18.598
I don't know how much
more I can take.

36:21.102 --> 36:22.736
First, Molly;
Then, Mary.

36:22.738 --> 36:24.738
Mary?

36:24.740 --> 36:26.639
Mary's alive.

36:26.641 --> 36:30.143
She's alive,

36:30.145 --> 36:32.178
but she's dead,
to me.

36:32.180 --> 36:36.182
I'm a fool.

36:36.184 --> 36:38.752
A damn fool.

36:38.754 --> 36:44.324
She's...

36:45.594 --> 36:48.828
She ran off
to england

36:48.830 --> 36:51.931
with some
other fella.

36:51.933 --> 36:53.767
She did you
a favor, then.

36:53.769 --> 36:55.368
Look, there'll be
other women.

36:55.370 --> 36:59.005
Oh, I'm done.

36:59.007 --> 37:00.540
Finished.

37:00.542 --> 37:05.445
Saloons,
whorehouses.

37:06.815 --> 37:09.549
I'm going to go
to the church.

37:09.551 --> 37:12.919
See if the lord!

37:12.921 --> 37:15.989
Will <i>finally</i>
<i>accept me,</i>

37:15.991 --> 37:17.457
respect me!

37:17.459 --> 37:21.161
And get me out of
this godforsaken city.

37:21.163 --> 37:22.929
Put your clothes on,
clean yourself up,

37:22.931 --> 37:25.732
lets go.

37:25.734 --> 37:28.435
The carriage went up
as if hit by a Cannon.

37:28.437 --> 37:30.036
Greek fire.

37:30.038 --> 37:31.571
I've seen it
a few times,

37:31.573 --> 37:34.007
but never enough to fill
a jar like this.

37:34.009 --> 37:37.277
Some say Nero used it
to burn Rome.

37:37.279 --> 37:39.979
Where'd you find
this stuff?

37:39.981 --> 37:42.148
Oh, part of a new
business venture

37:42.150 --> 37:43.550
I'm considering.

37:53.260 --> 37:55.228
Oh!

37:55.230 --> 37:57.397
That's some dangerous
business, major.

38:10.329 --> 38:12.263
How's that feel?

38:12.265 --> 38:14.499
Like I'm the soup.

38:19.239 --> 38:21.105
Why didn't you
and your wife

38:21.107 --> 38:23.241
have more than
one child?

38:23.243 --> 38:26.290
When did you start
talking all the time?

38:27.848 --> 38:29.760
Maggie was lucky
to have you.

38:30.550 --> 38:34.986
I know how she must've
felt, being with you.

38:42.895 --> 38:45.697
I love the dress.

38:45.699 --> 38:47.131
Thank you,
Corky.

38:49.602 --> 38:51.636
Kevin?

38:54.773 --> 38:56.736
Can I give you
a kiss goodnight?

39:11.503 --> 39:13.261
Leave the door open
a crack, will you?

39:15.128 --> 39:16.694
Makes me
feel safe.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.746
It's that girl,

40:03.176 --> 40:04.625
Annie.

40:06.047 --> 40:07.660
She has him
possessed.

40:09.016 --> 40:10.612
He's not himself.

40:13.413 --> 40:14.752
Or maybe he is.

40:25.538 --> 40:27.281
Elizabeth,
you and I,

40:27.802 --> 40:30.569
we read
the same books,

40:30.571 --> 40:34.540
we've seen
the same operas,

40:34.542 --> 40:38.043
we eat at the same
restaurants.

40:38.045 --> 40:39.778
He does not.

40:44.971 --> 40:46.278
You know

40:47.462 --> 40:50.222
how much I admire
Kevin Corcoran,

40:52.598 --> 40:54.901
but I led these men
in war.

40:57.843 --> 40:59.322
They act on impulse,

41:00.769 --> 41:02.886
whether they're at their best
or their worst.

41:05.018 --> 41:06.761
I fear that I do
as well.

41:08.940 --> 41:09.796
Still...

41:15.929 --> 41:18.279
I can't seem
to calm my nerves.

41:29.061 --> 41:33.130
I have... A cure.

41:35.969 --> 41:38.936
Opium tincture,

41:38.938 --> 41:42.253
a product derived

41:42.378 --> 41:43.700
from the poppy
flower.

41:47.949 --> 41:49.194
A way to relax,

41:51.576 --> 41:53.517
lessen
your anxiety.

42:00.512 --> 42:02.069
All the right women
are trying it.

42:16.450 --> 42:17.897
What if Corcoran
comes back?

42:25.431 --> 42:27.610
Then I will be
by your side.

42:29.322 --> 42:31.236
Yes, you will,
won't you?

42:32.492 --> 42:34.240
You have my word.

42:34.832 --> 42:36.793
And you are a man
of your word, Robert.

42:39.781 --> 42:40.746
Thank you.
