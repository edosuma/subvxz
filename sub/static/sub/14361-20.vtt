00:13.207 --> 00:17.748
Congratulations to the class
of first quarter 2013!

00:18.951 --> 00:20.910
Class of
first quarter 2013 rules!

00:22.840 --> 00:25.436
Aha! Way to go, mom!

00:25.519 --> 00:26.429
Aw.

00:26.533 --> 00:27.785
I'm really proud
of you, Frankie.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.701
Well, I think
I can speak for all of us

00:29.838 --> 00:31.921
when I say
you're a true inspiration.

00:32.042 --> 00:33.255
And if we can achieve...

00:33.379 --> 00:34.285
You're not getting a car.

00:34.390 --> 00:36.430
God! But-- ugh.
You're gonna get a job.

00:36.571 --> 00:39.455
I'm sorry. I'm so confused.
What was all this for?

00:40.371 --> 00:42.515
Okay, turn into the kitchen.

00:44.406 --> 00:46.113
To the right. To the right.

00:46.211 --> 00:47.703
Okay, stop.
Watch your head.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.270
Darrin lost at crazy eights,

00:49.378 --> 00:51.415
and now he has to carry me
everywhere today.

00:51.623 --> 00:54.810
<i>Now that Sue and Darrin had</i>
<i>graduated to full-time couple,</i>

00:54.935 --> 00:56.754
<i>Axl decided for the sake</i>
<i>of their friendship</i>

00:56.885 --> 00:59.228
<i>he'd suck it up</i>
<i>and swallow his feelings.</i>

00:59.331 --> 01:00.300
Mind if I talk to my friend,

01:00.397 --> 01:01.840
or is that not allowed?

01:01.983 --> 01:03.359
Oh! <i>Please.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:04.303
I'm not one of those girls

01:04.431 --> 01:06.917
who has to be
with her boyfriend 24/7.

01:08.959 --> 01:09.960
So what's up?

01:10.082 --> 01:12.009
Well, while you've been busy
giving dorkyback rides,

01:12.136 --> 01:13.576
I've been out
marketing our band,

01:13.632 --> 01:16.084
and guess what--
I got us our first paying gig.

01:16.184 --> 01:16.958
Avert your eyes

01:17.066 --> 01:19.057
or risk being blinded
by my awesomeness.

01:19.195 --> 01:20.581
You're kidding.
That's great!

01:20.703 --> 01:22.756
Now get ready, 'cause we are
on a rocket ship to stardom.

01:22.829 --> 01:25.057
We are playing
at the Orson Dollar Days!

01:25.169 --> 01:26.604
The one they do
in the parking lot every year

01:26.702 --> 01:27.928
behind the shoe warehouse?

01:28.025 --> 01:30.666
Not only that,
but they're paying us $50,

01:30.803 --> 01:32.747
or 100 Dollar Day dollars.

01:32.865 --> 01:34.576
No expiration date,
discount merchandise only,

01:34.669 --> 01:36.283
- all sales, final, blah.
- This is awesome.

01:36.396 --> 01:37.299
Maybe I could use my cut

01:37.420 --> 01:39.929
to buy Sue those
imitation Ugg boots she wants.

01:40.070 --> 01:43.838
Yeah, I think Ugg boots would be
the perfect gift for Sue.

01:44.860 --> 01:46.487
What? They would.

01:47.338 --> 01:48.749
So what do you think of this?

01:48.844 --> 01:49.628
I like it.

01:49.717 --> 01:50.676
Well, how 'bout this one?

01:50.788 --> 01:52.214
Yeah. Like that one, too.

01:52.350 --> 01:55.155
<i>Mike.</i> You're just trying
to get out of helping.

01:55.246 --> 01:56.060
Did it work?

01:56.161 --> 01:59.501
Oh, I can't believe I actually
have to go on interviews now.

01:59.634 --> 02:02.402
Maybe I should take
a sip of wine before I go in.

02:02.517 --> 02:04.684
People always say
I'm great at parties.

02:05.245 --> 02:06.295
Don't know how many dentists

02:06.416 --> 02:08.466
are looking for
a drunk Beyonce impersonator,

02:08.568 --> 02:10.128
but worth a shot.

02:10.245 --> 02:11.486
Brick, what are you doing?

02:11.813 --> 02:13.247
Oh, I'm earning
my family life badge

02:13.362 --> 02:14.762
for Prairie Scouts.

02:15.676 --> 02:17.765
You-- you're in Scouts?
Since when?

02:17.866 --> 02:20.378
Joined a couple weeks ago.
Did I not tell you?

02:20.491 --> 02:21.817
You did not.

02:22.449 --> 02:23.562
Well, who did I tell?

02:23.712 --> 02:26.462
Well, I think it's great that
you've joined something, Brick.

02:26.574 --> 02:28.344
But Scouts? Really?

02:28.469 --> 02:30.363
I checked out an old handbook
from the library,

02:30.499 --> 02:32.040
and I found it very appealing.

02:32.149 --> 02:34.680
And it has
an interesting font-- Menlo Bold.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.415
Menlo Bold.

02:36.702 --> 02:37.944
Now can you please sign this,

02:38.053 --> 02:39.871
saying that I completed the task
in an efficient manner

02:39.976 --> 02:41.320
with a first-rate attitude?

02:41.714 --> 02:42.648
Mm-hmm.

02:43.366 --> 02:44.309
There you go.

02:45.239 --> 02:47.669
Oh, and I'm going to need $40.

02:49.688 --> 02:51.097
Hmm.

02:51.198 --> 02:53.734
I'd hold off on that check.
You know he's just gonna quit.

02:53.897 --> 02:56.489
You know, you should
be thrilled, Mike.

02:56.596 --> 02:59.234
Your odd son
wants to do a boy thing.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.239
Yeah. I've been
burned before, Frankie.

03:01.334 --> 03:03.816
Remember basketball? All he did
was count the dribbles.

03:03.914 --> 03:05.849
I don't know. He seems to be
really into it this time.

03:05.969 --> 03:07.291
This could be his thing.

03:07.483 --> 03:08.581
It's not his thing.

03:08.686 --> 03:10.387
Oh, yeah?
You don't know that.

03:10.508 --> 03:11.932
He made our bed.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.477 --> 03:22.161
Packin' it in
and hittin' the road?

03:22.400 --> 03:24.451
My Scout troop's
going camping this weekend.

03:24.569 --> 03:26.619
Camping? You remember
what that is, right?

03:26.751 --> 03:29.203
When we slept in a tent,
outside with the bugs?

03:29.305 --> 03:31.749
I know. I'm gonna
get my camping badge.

03:32.406 --> 03:34.483
But I can't go
if I don't get that check.

03:34.592 --> 03:35.409
So...

03:35.511 --> 03:37.207
Yeah. About that,
look, Brick,

03:37.306 --> 03:39.404
we can't afford
to just fork over 40 bucks

03:39.508 --> 03:41.035
for something
you're just gonna quit.

03:41.241 --> 03:42.606
I get your concern.

03:42.909 --> 03:44.824
I understand I've been
a quitter in the past.

03:45.187 --> 03:47.363
That's mom's influence.

03:47.459 --> 03:49.644
- Yeah, probably.
- But not this time.

03:49.775 --> 03:50.944
I'm committed, dad.

03:51.058 --> 03:52.283
I'm in it till the end.

03:52.428 --> 03:54.739
Okay. Well, you realize
the end is not tomorrow.

03:54.841 --> 03:56.476
We're gonna get our 40 bucks
worth of fun out of this

03:56.581 --> 03:58.272
no matter how miserable
you are.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.390
It's all good, dad.
I've got this.

04:02.831 --> 04:04.553
I didn't get the job.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.883
Aw. Well, don't worry.

04:07.028 --> 04:09.571
You'll get 'em next time.
Right?

04:10.278 --> 04:11.588
I'm not so sure, Mike.

04:11.691 --> 04:13.524
Apparently,
in order to get a job,

04:13.639 --> 04:15.692
you have to know who you are.

04:15.884 --> 04:16.826
Well, I know who you are.

04:16.928 --> 04:18.132
You're someone who needs a job.

04:18.233 --> 04:20.166
Well, that's not enough
anymore.

04:20.410 --> 04:21.735
It's a whole thing now.

04:21.832 --> 04:23.250
You gotta be able
to sell yourself.

04:23.434 --> 04:25.779
I wasn't even able
to sell a car.

04:25.893 --> 04:28.152
How the heck am I
supposed to sell myself?

04:28.252 --> 04:30.421
That's true.
That is why you got fired.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.197
I was not fired, Brick.
I was let-- ugh.

04:33.294 --> 04:35.810
Anyway, the whole way home,
I'm thinkin',

04:35.979 --> 04:39.437
"I don't know. Do I even know
who I am anymore?"

04:39.704 --> 04:41.650
I mean, okay, help me out here.

04:41.751 --> 04:42.618
Come on.
Just give me something.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.066
If you had one word
to describe me,

04:44.169 --> 04:45.204
what would it be?

04:45.320 --> 04:46.182
- Lazy. - Angry.
- Tired.

04:46.291 --> 04:47.529
Hey, hey, hey. One at a time.

04:47.684 --> 04:48.993
- Lazy.
- Angry.

04:49.108 --> 04:49.881
Tired.

04:50.047 --> 04:52.205
Actually, "lazy" and "tired"
are kind of the same thing.

04:52.329 --> 04:55.489
Yeah, but I still think
she's more lazy than angry.

04:55.839 --> 04:57.702
I don't know. If you call her
on being lazy,

04:57.802 --> 04:59.296
- she gets really angry.
- Mm.

04:59.410 --> 05:00.514
That's not fair.

05:00.639 --> 05:01.535
Thank you.

05:01.659 --> 05:03.342
She's only angry
because she's getting older,

05:03.466 --> 05:04.685
nothing turned out
like she wanted,

05:04.799 --> 05:06.604
and now at this
late stage of her life,

05:06.707 --> 05:09.006
when she <i>should</i> be able
to kick back and relax,

05:09.146 --> 05:11.238
she's stuck grabbing
at her one last chance

05:11.328 --> 05:13.302
to try and make something
of herself.

05:13.751 --> 05:15.755
Wait. What about naggy?

05:15.917 --> 05:17.449
- Good answer.
- Oh, good answer.

05:17.572 --> 05:18.767
- Very good answer.
- Good answer.

05:18.869 --> 05:20.178
Okay, that's enough.

05:20.283 --> 05:23.747
The reason your mom
is tired, lazy, and irritable

05:23.868 --> 05:25.068
is 'cause of you guys.

05:25.184 --> 05:27.813
No one... said... <i>irritable.</i>

05:27.910 --> 05:29.308
Okay, fine.
You're not irritable.

05:29.426 --> 05:31.829
You know what? Forget it.
You people are useless.

05:32.418 --> 05:35.322
We were only trying to help.
God, she is so ungrateful.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.169
Ooh! Ungrateful!

05:37.275 --> 05:38.856
- Good answer.
- Good answer.

05:38.955 --> 05:40.925
- Good answer.
- Good answer.

05:50.176 --> 05:52.352
Whoo!

05:52.523 --> 05:53.333
This'll be, like,

05:53.445 --> 05:55.705
our Axl And The Ax Men
signature pose.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.332
We should seriously
try to patent it.

05:57.662 --> 05:59.576
Uh, yeah.
I've been thinking...

05:59.686 --> 06:03.553
our name sounds a little...
'50s, or whatever.

06:03.668 --> 06:04.684
What are you talking about?

06:04.776 --> 06:06.682
Well, Sue had
an interesting idea.

06:06.794 --> 06:08.909
Yeah. Okay.

06:08.995 --> 06:10.663
Yeah. Well,
we were hanging out,

06:10.767 --> 06:12.161
you know,
and talking and stuff,

06:12.351 --> 06:15.346
and I thought maybe it did sound
a little... blah.

06:15.581 --> 06:18.872
But then we thought
what if it had all your names--

06:18.957 --> 06:21.071
Darrin, Sean, Axl--

06:21.216 --> 06:23.324
Daseanax.

06:23.434 --> 06:24.516
What?

06:24.609 --> 06:26.121
Daseanax?

06:26.216 --> 06:28.308
Huh. That's actually
pretty cool.

06:28.419 --> 06:30.716
Oh, my God.
In what universe?

06:30.805 --> 06:32.667
<i>We</i> are a brand--

06:32.772 --> 06:34.948
Axl And The Axmen.

06:35.086 --> 06:36.191
And, yes, my name's on it.

06:36.303 --> 06:37.539
But I'm the one
who started the band,

06:37.640 --> 06:39.025
I'm the one
who got us this gig,

06:39.170 --> 06:40.527
and I was the one
who was up all last night

06:40.623 --> 06:42.105
working on a new album cover!

06:42.230 --> 06:43.284
No, you didn't.

06:43.425 --> 06:46.116
You watched "Titanic" with mom
and then you went to bed.

06:46.457 --> 06:49.154
I think he was crying.
He cries a lot.

06:49.392 --> 06:50.573
Let's just play.

06:50.722 --> 06:52.521
One, two, three, four!

06:56.464 --> 06:57.944
Dude, dude,
you are killing the song.

06:58.046 --> 06:59.192
We need more egg.

06:59.276 --> 07:01.608
I can't drum and play
the egg at the same time.

07:01.731 --> 07:02.915
I'm not an octopus.

07:04.772 --> 07:05.793
Uh, I'll do it.

07:05.898 --> 07:07.709
I-I played the tambourine
for Reverend Timtom.

07:07.816 --> 07:08.825
And I don't wanna brag,

07:08.923 --> 07:11.252
but I was <i>pretty good.</i>

07:11.367 --> 07:13.632
Nope. No way!
Not happening.

07:13.729 --> 07:15.744
My sister is not in the band.

07:15.854 --> 07:17.388
We're out of hands, Axl.

07:17.461 --> 07:19.280
The song doesn't rock
without the egg.

07:19.378 --> 07:20.753
We got no choice.

07:21.227 --> 07:22.930
I say we give her a chance.

07:24.317 --> 07:25.775
Yeah!

07:32.556 --> 07:35.133
Okay.
If I'm at a social event,

07:35.245 --> 07:37.417
am I a party princess,

07:37.532 --> 07:39.074
a solitary Suzy,

07:39.208 --> 07:41.433
or in the corner,
talking to the principal?

07:42.467 --> 07:43.560
What are you doing?

07:43.694 --> 07:46.315
Well, I'm still trying
to figure out who I am.

07:46.445 --> 07:48.664
And Sue told me to go
to kickinitteenstyle.com

07:48.775 --> 07:50.279
and take the personality quiz.

07:50.393 --> 07:52.791
You're taking life advice from Sue?

07:52.887 --> 07:53.958
You've seen her life, right?

07:54.051 --> 07:55.757
I'm desperate, okay?

07:55.914 --> 07:58.619
All right. So-- so who am I?
Who am I?

07:58.751 --> 08:00.788
I... I... I...

08:00.923 --> 08:02.637
Ooh. I'm a good snapper.

08:03.058 --> 08:04.886
- Seriously.
- Well, you're a great mom.

08:05.095 --> 08:06.321
Yeah.

08:06.491 --> 08:09.185
I know I'm a great mom.
Duh, Mike.

08:09.302 --> 08:11.632
But being a great mom
isn't gonna get me a job.

08:11.753 --> 08:13.388
Who am I <i>other</i> than that?

08:13.506 --> 08:15.270
I-I really don't know.

08:16.270 --> 08:19.289
Okay. What about nice?
I'm nice.

08:19.605 --> 08:20.171
Eh.

08:20.286 --> 08:22.191
Okay, then,
how 'bout hard worker?

08:22.408 --> 08:24.696
Yeah.
That's not true, either.

08:32.202 --> 08:33.640
Hang on.

08:33.770 --> 08:35.672
Isn't this
your social skills group?

08:35.780 --> 08:38.075
Yeah. We went to
a regular Scout meeting before,

08:38.202 --> 08:39.241
but after a few weeks,

08:39.361 --> 08:40.714
they decided to give us
our own troop.

08:40.835 --> 08:41.957
Wasn't that nice?

08:42.636 --> 08:44.317
You know what time it is, boy?

08:44.574 --> 08:45.967
I'll tell you
what time it is--

08:46.068 --> 08:47.300
it's late o'clock.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.686
Told you we didn't have time
to stop for a sausage biscuit.

08:50.012 --> 08:52.019
Mike Heck. Brick's dad.

08:52.445 --> 08:54.577
Okay. I got him.
You can go.

08:54.777 --> 08:57.202
Huh. Yeah, hey, uh,

08:57.316 --> 08:59.234
maybe I didn't read
the permission slip too clearly.

08:59.340 --> 09:01.389
But, uh, where exactly
are you taking 'em?

09:01.735 --> 09:02.950
We're going out there,

09:03.512 --> 09:06.662
in the deep woods,
where a man can get lost,

09:07.351 --> 09:10.538
where he's got no past,
no future.

09:11.019 --> 09:12.923
Only the now.

09:13.766 --> 09:14.927
Uh-huh.

09:15.318 --> 09:17.618
And, uh, where is that,
exactly?

09:18.066 --> 09:20.767
Oh, no, soldier.
That's classified.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.179
He's got my ax!

09:22.271 --> 09:24.305
Tell him it's my turn
with the ax!

09:24.509 --> 09:26.405
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:26.487 --> 09:28.169
Hey. Hey.

09:28.266 --> 09:30.061
That's the way you hold
a knife when you're whittling.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.437
<i>That's</i> how you hold a knife
when you're gonna kill a man.

09:33.541 --> 09:36.215
Oh. I see.
Thanks, Mr. Stokes.

09:37.747 --> 09:38.815
I'll tell you what,
Mr. Stokes,

09:38.913 --> 09:40.736
while you're gettin' lost
in the deep woods,

09:40.836 --> 09:42.720
these kids are gonna be
doing something else.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.164
But, dad, this is the most

09:44.242 --> 09:46.432
I've ever not quit something
my whole life.

09:46.646 --> 09:48.462
What are we all
supposed to do now?

09:53.066 --> 09:55.133
<i>So Mike found himself</i>
<i>the unwitting Scoutmaster</i>

09:55.236 --> 09:56.529
<i>of troop crazy.</i>

09:56.676 --> 09:58.405
All right.
You all got your waters.

09:58.594 --> 10:00.280
Now go to bed.

10:00.619 --> 10:02.755
Can we get
a bedtime story, Mr. Heck?

10:02.871 --> 10:05.050
I can't sleep
without a bedtime story.

10:05.152 --> 10:06.298
According to this manual,

10:06.404 --> 10:09.088
we're supposed to practice
a duck and cover drill

10:09.193 --> 10:11.180
in case the dirty commies
lob a nuke at us

10:11.264 --> 10:12.495
- during the night.
- No.

10:12.593 --> 10:14.325
We already built a fire,
ate hot dogs,

10:14.426 --> 10:16.828
made a compass with a leaf,
and practiced your salute.

10:16.942 --> 10:18.268
Let's just go to bed.

10:19.673 --> 10:23.223
Zack? Where you been?

10:23.318 --> 10:24.494
I've been calling for you.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.448
No more chasing birds.
It's lights out.

10:26.535 --> 10:27.600
I'm hungry.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.440
Ham and cheese!

10:31.536 --> 10:33.620
<i>While Mike was making</i>
<i>three PB&Js--</i>

10:33.715 --> 10:35.381
<i>one with crust, two without--</i>

10:35.504 --> 10:37.251
<i>two ham and cheeses,</i>
<i>an iced tea...</i>

10:37.335 --> 10:38.967
<i>three juices,</i>
<i>and a saucer of milk,</i>

10:39.102 --> 10:41.592
<i>Axl was getting his band ready</i>
<i>for their big night.</i>

10:42.818 --> 10:44.744
Okay.
Checked the schedule.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.010
We're going on between

10:46.109 --> 10:48.429
the Fancy Feet "Gangnam Style"
tap number

10:48.546 --> 10:49.805
and Itty Bitty Jujitsu.

10:49.912 --> 10:51.274
Whoo. Nice spot.

10:51.375 --> 10:52.911
Those Jujitsu kids
are really good.

10:53.021 --> 10:54.245
Are you sure about this, Axl?

10:54.349 --> 10:55.594
Guess I was expecting...
I don't know,

10:55.683 --> 10:57.556
something a little more
less sad.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.277
Dude, every band's
gotta pay their dues.

10:59.388 --> 11:01.355
This'll be a great story
for "Rolling Stone" someday

11:01.488 --> 11:02.712
when we're kicking it
in our mansions,

11:02.817 --> 11:05.006
trying to decide which Ferraris
to take to go yachting.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.672
It'll humanize us.

11:08.472 --> 11:09.747
Uh... what is that?

11:09.857 --> 11:11.346
Oh, okay, okay.

11:11.454 --> 11:13.841
The thing is, I had already
ordered the sticker

11:13.948 --> 11:15.781
before you said you didn't
want to change the name.

11:15.897 --> 11:18.514
And then I was gonna tell you,
but then I forgot,

11:18.629 --> 11:21.032
so then I thought I would
just bring it here anyway

11:21.116 --> 11:23.565
and see how everybody felt
once it was here.

11:23.679 --> 11:24.669
Well, I like it.

11:24.928 --> 11:26.538
I think it looks awesome, Sue.

11:26.648 --> 11:29.133
Do you, Darrin? Do you really
think it looks awesome?

11:29.255 --> 11:30.199
'Cause you know what I think?

11:30.325 --> 11:32.147
I think <i>I've had it!</i>

11:32.251 --> 11:34.589
I have been so cool.
So cool!

11:34.685 --> 11:35.848
But I am so sick of this!

11:35.997 --> 11:38.580
You...
are Yoko-ing the band!

11:38.689 --> 11:39.733
But not just the band,

11:39.846 --> 11:42.593
you're Yoko-ing my school,
you're Yoko-ing my house.

11:42.690 --> 11:44.335
You two together are poison!

11:44.456 --> 11:46.164
You wanna be Daseanax?
Fine.

11:46.267 --> 11:48.473
Go ahead. No, maybe you should
be Daseansue,

11:48.596 --> 11:50.978
'cause the Ax Man...
is out!

11:59.763 --> 12:01.787
- Mr. Heck.
- Hmm?

12:01.928 --> 12:04.019
I'm having a sock issue.

12:04.128 --> 12:05.547
They touched the ground.

12:05.631 --> 12:07.581
Oh, it's okay.
Use your backup socks.

12:07.671 --> 12:10.645
I did already.
<i>And</i> my backup backup socks.

12:10.756 --> 12:13.967
This is an emergency.
I need to go home.

12:14.065 --> 12:16.686
Oh, no. You can't.
No one's here at the house.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.533
If I take you home, I gotta
take everybody else with me.

12:19.642 --> 12:21.243
How 'bout I get you
a pair of my socks?

12:21.786 --> 12:24.064
Unacceptable. Unacceptable.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.366
Unacceptable!

12:25.624 --> 12:27.747
Can I sit
up front with you, Mr. Heck?

12:27.866 --> 12:29.485
You're easy to talk to!

12:44.194 --> 12:45.704
Here, kitty, kitty.

12:45.912 --> 12:48.183
<i>While Mike was searching</i>
<i>for a rogue Scout,</i>

12:48.294 --> 12:50.870
<i>I was Aunt Edie's,</i>
<i>talking to my mom.</i>

12:50.988 --> 12:55.432
Look, honey, any dental office
would be lucky to have you.

12:55.568 --> 12:57.108
Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.400
No. It's true.

12:58.493 --> 13:01.018
People have always loved
being around you.

13:01.119 --> 13:03.677
All the moms wanted you
in their carpool.

13:03.770 --> 13:05.502
You were very lively.

13:05.961 --> 13:07.321
You know, I <i>have</i> noticed

13:07.410 --> 13:09.333
that when I sign up
for something at church,

13:09.425 --> 13:11.208
one or two people
sign up after me.

13:11.316 --> 13:13.766
I did not give birth
to average people.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.569
I am telling you,
you are the whole package.

13:16.694 --> 13:22.251
You are a warm, special,
beautiful, amazing person.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.700
And if they don't believe that,
they can call me.

13:25.799 --> 13:28.285
Oh, thank you.

13:28.798 --> 13:30.897
<i>Mom always seems</i>
<i>to have the answers.</i>

13:31.388 --> 13:32.935
<i>Why did I ever move out?</i>

13:35.886 --> 13:37.081
Hey, uh, look,

13:37.501 --> 13:39.242
about what happened before...

13:40.226 --> 13:41.754
I think we should talk.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.272
Okay. I'm listening.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.520
We've been friends a long time.

13:46.837 --> 13:48.201
And I just want to say,

13:48.295 --> 13:50.578
I feel you're being
disrespectful to Sue.

13:51.197 --> 13:53.677
What?
Are-- are you kidding me?

13:53.764 --> 13:54.779
I don't know
if you realize this,

13:54.890 --> 13:57.076
but sometimes,
you sort of make fun of her

13:57.184 --> 13:59.679
and put her down.
She has a lot to offer,

13:59.777 --> 14:01.613
- and I think you could be more supportive.
- Wait.

14:01.730 --> 14:04.938
Don't tell me how to treat Sue.
She is <i>my</i> sister.

14:05.038 --> 14:06.368
And if I wanna
rank on my sister

14:06.493 --> 14:07.877
or fart on my sister's head,

14:07.992 --> 14:09.875
I <i>will</i> fart
on my sister's head.

14:09.993 --> 14:11.562
Maybe you can't see it
'cause you're her brother,

14:11.654 --> 14:13.864
but she's a sensitive,
beautiful woman.

14:13.984 --> 14:16.461
Oh! Blah! Don't call
my sister a woman!

14:16.602 --> 14:18.137
That is disgusting.
And you know what?

14:18.250 --> 14:20.323
You could have dated, like,
any other girl in the world,

14:20.429 --> 14:22.068
but you just had
to pick my sister.

14:22.156 --> 14:23.276
I really like her.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.317
She's sweet and funny,
and all these--

14:25.397 --> 14:27.052
Oh, my God, I will not stand by

14:27.158 --> 14:28.740
while you say
nice things about her.

14:28.832 --> 14:29.631
Hey, hold on.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.218
- I think we should talk about this.
- No! I'm done!

14:31.310 --> 14:32.609
Get out of my face!

14:33.352 --> 14:34.431
Did you just flick me?

14:34.517 --> 14:35.754
Yeah. What? You wanna
do something about it?

14:35.838 --> 14:36.785
Yeah.

14:36.882 --> 14:38.093
What the...

14:38.244 --> 14:39.259
You little...

14:40.634 --> 14:41.709
Hey! Aah!

14:41.795 --> 14:42.770
Oh!

14:42.879 --> 14:44.396
Stupid sister lover!

14:44.494 --> 14:45.530
Aah! I hate you!

14:45.646 --> 14:46.636
You're goin' down!

14:47.165 --> 14:49.408
Ooh! Hey! Get--

14:54.593 --> 14:55.496
Stop!

14:55.676 --> 14:58.402
Stop! Stop it!
You guys are friends!

14:58.583 --> 14:59.852
Aah!

14:59.922 --> 15:01.290
- Sue!
- Sue!

15:07.900 --> 15:10.847
How's it look?

15:11.547 --> 15:13.810
Good.
You can hardly see it.

15:14.336 --> 15:15.448
Oh...

15:15.740 --> 15:17.526
okay, listen, Darrin,

15:17.963 --> 15:19.414
I've been thinking...

15:19.716 --> 15:23.219
that punch in the face
was a real slap in the face.

15:23.329 --> 15:24.808
You know, when we got together,

15:24.974 --> 15:27.915
we didn't even think about
how it would affect anyone else.

15:28.016 --> 15:31.704
And now we've just left a trail
of destruction in our wake.

15:31.886 --> 15:33.433
I just feel like you and Axl

15:33.547 --> 15:35.768
have been friends
for, like, ever.

15:35.903 --> 15:39.009
And I don't wanna be the one
to come between you two.

15:39.165 --> 15:40.338
Yeah.

15:41.454 --> 15:42.778
Wait a minute.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.772
Are you breaking up with me?

15:45.019 --> 15:47.520
Oh, gosh. I've never
done this before,

15:47.626 --> 15:49.619
and I have no idea
if I'm doing it right.

15:49.774 --> 15:52.576
No.
You're doing it right.

15:53.611 --> 15:55.701
I'm so sorry, Darrin.

15:56.146 --> 15:57.922
I really, really am.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.483
Breakups are tough.

15:59.624 --> 16:02.081
Matt broke my heart.

16:02.330 --> 16:04.301
And Brad and I split
three years ago,

16:04.422 --> 16:06.335
and he still hasn't
kissed a girl.

16:06.783 --> 16:10.248
But I just feel like
it's getting too hard.

16:10.535 --> 16:12.699
Yeah. Axl and I always said

16:12.805 --> 16:14.946
we'd never
let a woman come between us.

16:15.572 --> 16:16.961
That's a much easier pact
to make

16:17.068 --> 16:19.235
when you're 6
and girls have cooties.

16:21.103 --> 16:22.455
And when you think about it,

16:22.579 --> 16:25.668
you know, we only have
two months of school left.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.796
And I have all
my sophomore activities,

16:27.896 --> 16:29.904
and you have all
your senior activities.

16:30.004 --> 16:33.451
And... what about all the girls
at air conditioning school?

16:33.850 --> 16:35.889
You're not gonna want
to be tied down.

16:36.525 --> 16:40.014
I just feel like
we'd be better friends.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.252
I guess I can live with that.

16:43.334 --> 16:46.257
But I'm always gonna think of
you when I see a mirror ball.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.293
And I'll always
think of you when I dance...

16:49.406 --> 16:51.163
or taste blood.

16:54.595 --> 16:58.540
Mm! Ooh!
It hurts so bad.

16:58.637 --> 17:01.020
I know. Me, too.

17:03.018 --> 17:06.683
Knock it off, Zack.
Go back to sleep.

17:08.959 --> 17:11.073
Brick, I think we should
pull the plug on this thing.

17:11.175 --> 17:12.457
I am not quitting, dad.

17:12.547 --> 17:13.825
I'm in it to win it.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.978
Do you want me to tell
Zack you'll take him home

17:16.069 --> 17:17.931
so we don't wake
the other kids?

17:18.358 --> 17:21.284
<i>Mike didn't know it, but his</i>
<i>night was just beginning.</i>

17:21.540 --> 17:23.182
<i>One by one,
he took each kid home</i>

17:23.287 --> 17:26.012
<i>from dusk</i>
<i>all the way till dawn.</i>

17:27.445 --> 17:30.260
Brick, if you wanna
go in the house, just go,

17:30.361 --> 17:31.695
but let me sleep.

17:31.786 --> 17:34.198
No. It's morning.
I did it.

17:34.623 --> 17:36.440
Now would you please sign this

17:36.546 --> 17:37.785
saying that
I showed perseverance

17:37.882 --> 17:39.300
in the face
of difficult obstacles

17:39.429 --> 17:41.151
and handled myself
in a Scout-like manner

17:41.287 --> 17:43.277
worthy of camping badge?

17:43.381 --> 17:44.761
I'd say we both did.

17:46.382 --> 17:49.006
Now I need you
to go get your mom,

17:49.210 --> 17:50.814
roll me back
onto my sleeping bag,

17:50.911 --> 17:52.781
and drag me into the house.

17:56.464 --> 17:58.335
Ah, hi.
Frankie Heck.

17:58.448 --> 18:02.375
I am Ted. Doctor.
Dr. Ted Goodwin, DDS,

18:02.480 --> 18:05.188
from ICD--
Iowa College of Dentistry.

18:05.289 --> 18:07.344
Go, Hawks! I hated school.

18:07.447 --> 18:09.442
Hi. Frankie Heck.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.961
I am sorry about this mess.

18:13.097 --> 18:15.079
I gotta get around
to writing on these someday.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.741
But I cannot find a pen.

18:17.912 --> 18:20.751
Uh, and after a while,
you just get tired

18:20.858 --> 18:22.550
of writing,
"Plaque. Plaque. Plaque."

18:22.647 --> 18:24.052
You know?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.785
Orson has
an intense plaque problem.

18:26.882 --> 18:29.276
<i>But</i> I'm not one
to speak out of school.

18:30.729 --> 18:34.546
Uh, so, I guess
I ask you questions, right?

18:34.848 --> 18:38.191
Okay. Well, tell me...

18:38.403 --> 18:40.647
who is Frankie Heck?

18:41.029 --> 18:44.769
Well, I'm warm and special
and amazing

18:44.877 --> 18:46.588
and beautiful and lively.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.870
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

18:49.170 --> 18:51.274
<i>I should never have listened</i>
<i>to my mother's load of crap.</i>

18:51.396 --> 18:53.273
<i>Of course she said</i>
<i>those things. She's my mother.</i>

18:53.360 --> 18:54.751
<i>I sound like an idiot.</i>

18:55.434 --> 18:57.561
You know what?
I don't know.

18:57.660 --> 18:59.149
I just don't know.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.964
You want one word
to describe me?

19:01.774 --> 19:04.302
"Mom." There. That's it.

19:04.648 --> 19:06.639
I can get dressed
in under 30 seconds.

19:06.761 --> 19:09.126
I can pull anything
out of my bag without looking.

19:09.221 --> 19:10.659
You need a quarter?

19:11.269 --> 19:12.631
Got it. Protein bar?

19:12.927 --> 19:15.562
How about a pen?
Blue or black?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.450
I can hold off creditors
for months,

19:18.564 --> 19:20.819
I can listen to five
conversations at the same time.

19:20.934 --> 19:23.992
Oh, and apparently,
I'm a delight in a carpool.

19:24.086 --> 19:26.644
Okay. I suck. Good-bye.
I'll let myself out.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.884
Uh, uh, first of all,

19:28.232 --> 19:31.288
I love my mom.
Moms are angels.

19:31.368 --> 19:33.433
Don't talk bad about moms.

19:33.537 --> 19:35.505
And I like that creditor thing.

19:35.665 --> 19:38.219
I used a lot of the government's
money to go to school,

19:38.326 --> 19:39.982
and they kind of want it back.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.509
Oh. Really?

19:41.653 --> 19:44.300
And how many kids
did you say you have?

19:44.398 --> 19:47.542
'Cause I see a lot of 'em here,
and they're nasty.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.508
Oh, I have three
wonderful children.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.832
They're really more like
my best friends.

19:52.923 --> 19:54.773
That's just like me and my mom.

19:57.373 --> 19:59.696
This just feels right to me.

19:59.844 --> 20:02.145
And I don't want to talk
to any more people.

20:03.082 --> 20:04.812
You're hired.

20:04.941 --> 20:06.170
Are you serious?

20:06.278 --> 20:08.194
Oh! Thank God!

20:08.616 --> 20:09.684
Oh. Ooh.

20:10.152 --> 20:12.903
Sorry. It's probably
too soon to do that.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.006
Must have been that sip of wine

20:14.099 --> 20:16.143
I had before I came in.

20:16.896 --> 20:18.618
<i>We all earn badges in life.</i>

20:19.622 --> 20:21.614
<i>Some tell the world</i>
<i>who you are,</i>

20:22.411 --> 20:24.621
<i>others tell the world</i>
<i>of your achievements.</i>

20:25.872 --> 20:27.623
<i>Some will stay</i>
<i>with you forever,</i>

20:28.389 --> 20:30.281
<i>and some you hope won't.</i>

20:33.728 --> 20:35.231
Sorry about your face.

20:35.982 --> 20:39.014
I know. 'Cause it's so ugly.
Ha ha.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.891
Good one.

20:40.986 --> 20:44.483
But, no, I was actually
asking how you're doing.

20:44.821 --> 20:47.489
Oh. Darrin and I
broke up.

20:48.020 --> 20:50.835
Ooh. Really?

20:50.931 --> 20:54.495
Yeah. Well, it seemed like
it was for the best.

20:55.023 --> 20:56.946
I think we're better
as friends.

20:57.437 --> 20:58.993
Hey, uh...

21:01.187 --> 21:03.363
all that stuff I do to you...

21:04.304 --> 21:06.644
it's just, you know,
what we do.

21:07.114 --> 21:09.229
It doesn't
mean anything, right?

21:10.008 --> 21:11.581
Right.

21:11.744 --> 21:13.612
Of course, I'm still gonna knock
the plate out of your hand,

21:13.713 --> 21:14.569
tickle you till you pee,

21:14.657 --> 21:16.694
and make you smell my armpit
from time to time.

21:17.582 --> 21:19.092
I understand.

21:19.206 --> 21:20.960
But I'll wait
till you're feeling better.

21:21.150 --> 21:22.671
I'm not a monster.

21:24.726 --> 21:25.851
You want a drink?

21:25.963 --> 21:29.715
Uh, no. My lip still hurts
when I try to sip things.

21:29.811 --> 21:31.547
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:31.645 --> 21:32.981
What are you gonna do
with that bread then?

21:33.103 --> 21:35.833
Well, I can eat it, but I have
to be sort of real careful...

21:36.384 --> 21:37.735
- Ahh.
- Ahh.
