Stop sleeping in your van, Jeff.

00:09.394 --> 00:10.795
Are you high?

00:10.829 --> 00:11.996
Morgan, the Intersect
that you uploaded,

00:12.014 --> 00:13.047
there's something wrong with it.

00:13.098 --> 00:14.298
There was some kind
of Trojan horse

00:14.333 --> 00:15.633
hidden in the software.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.368
That's why you're not
acting like yourself!

00:17.402 --> 00:19.637
You've text-messaged a breakup
with my little girl?

00:19.671 --> 00:20.721
I can do better.

00:20.772 --> 00:23.007
Morgan told
anyone who wanted to hear

00:23.041 --> 00:24.141
he had the Intersect.

Morgan, you stay away
from douche-cycle, okay?

00:57.376 --> 00:59.043
We've gotta get you back
to Castle now.

00:59.077 --> 01:00.278
The CIA knows you're
the Intersect.

01:00.312 --> 01:01.579
You have a hit out on you!

01:01.613 --> 01:04.748
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Yeah-yeah-yeah. Let's go

Let's go. Don't freak out,

I am still the Intersect.

01:13.075 --> 01:14.692
- I'm just gonna grab some...
- No, no!

01:16.562 --> 01:18.796
Yes, I agree that it is okay
to freak out.

01:18.830 --> 01:19.997
Thank you.

01:20.032 --> 01:20.998
Morgan, the only reason

01:21.033 --> 01:22.233
there's a hit on you is

01:22.267 --> 01:23.534
because you got the
Intersect in your head.

01:23.569 --> 01:25.403
CHUCK: So we just need
to get it out

01:25.437 --> 01:26.938
of your head, let
the CIA know it's over,

01:26.972 --> 01:27.939
and you'll be safe.

01:27.973 --> 01:29.106

01:32.144 --> 01:35.513
Okay, all right,
how do we start that?

02:03.575 --> 02:05.543
Yes, ma'am.

Let's get this mind-melting,

02:06.878 --> 02:09.997
assassination-producing thing
out of my head.

General, how long will it take

04:27.769 --> 04:29.520
I'll contact you

Clara is a rad yogi.

05:11.629 --> 05:12.796
You know,
I probably shouldn't say this,

05:12.814 --> 05:14.064
but she's a way more
grounded breather

05:14.099 --> 05:15.499

the big Salesman of
the Year convention

09:48.176 --> 09:49.459
is taking place
this weekend in Riverside.

09:49.511 --> 09:51.745
But you never sell anything.

09:51.779 --> 09:53.080
You just eat Pirate's Booty

09:53.114 --> 09:54.264
and watch large-
lady pornography.

09:54.299 --> 09:56.083
I'm aware of that,
but I rigged it

09:56.117 --> 09:57.718
so that every employee's sales
this quarter

09:57.752 --> 09:59.019
have been logged
under my name.

09:59.053 --> 10:00.087
My friend,

10:00.121 --> 10:02.255
I'm going to be
up to my eyebrows in

10:02.273 --> 10:07.594
popcorn shrimp and some sweet
Inland Empire lady parts.

10:07.629 --> 10:09.129
But what about
the rest of us?

10:09.164 --> 10:11.331
Like, what if I wanted to go?

10:11.366 --> 10:13.734
No, no, you don't.

10:13.768 --> 10:15.135
You like being number two.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.670
I made you
number two, man.

10:16.704 --> 10:17.938
I don't think I do.

10:17.956 --> 10:21.291
You do.Stop spewing nonsense.

10:21.326 --> 10:23.977
Sometimes I think
you are a bad person.

10:24.012 --> 10:26.180
Now, undo what
you've done.

10:26.214 --> 10:29.583
I know you'll feel better if
you earn this on your own.

10:29.617 --> 10:33.020
Son, are you reading a book?

10:33.054 --> 10:35.088
Yes, I am.

10:35.123 --> 10:37.124
I'm gonna get
my camera.

10:40.645 --> 10:43.931
CHUCK: Let the reeducation
of Morgan Grimes begin.

10:43.965 --> 10:45.399
Oh, yes, I am
so excited.

10:45.433 --> 10:46.633
What do I start with?

10:46.651 --> 10:49.019
Easy. <i>Star Wars.</i>

10:49.070 --> 10:52.005
(sighs)
I'm so jealous.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.107
Enjoy, while we sort this out.

10:54.142 --> 10:55.826
And don't worry,

10:55.860 --> 10:58.212
the Force is strong
in this one.

10:58.246 --> 11:00.013
Ah, no idea
what that means,

11:00.048 --> 11:01.582
(cell phone rings)
but I'm pumped.

11:01.616 --> 11:03.250
Well, have fun.

11:03.284 --> 11:04.751
Okay, all right.
Hello?

11:04.786 --> 11:07.454
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, Casey, Casey.

11:07.488 --> 11:09.456
Want to watch
<i>Star Wars</i> with me?

11:09.490 --> 11:11.959
Uh... no.
No, but hey,

11:11.993 --> 11:13.961
don't start
with <i>A New Hope.</i>

11:13.995 --> 11:15.762
Old ones, nobody
likes that.

11:15.797 --> 11:18.599
Phantom Menace.
Everybody loves <i>Phantom Menace.</i>

11:18.633 --> 11:20.350
Hey, you're all right.

11:20.385 --> 11:21.351
Thanks, man.

11:21.386 --> 11:22.369
Yeah, sure.

11:22.403 --> 11:24.705
<i>The Phantom Menace.</i>

11:24.739 --> 11:26.556
Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.

11:26.608 --> 11:28.008
I'm sorry, who is this again?

11:28.042 --> 11:30.010
Jeffrey. Jeffrey Barnes.

11:30.044 --> 11:32.012
You know, from the Buy More.
Oh!

11:32.030 --> 11:33.013
Hey... Jeff!

11:33.047 --> 11:37.034
Wow. You sound... normal.

11:37.068 --> 11:39.720
We really need a decision
on who will be chosen to go

11:39.754 --> 11:42.039
to the Buy More Salesman
of the Year weekend

11:42.073 --> 11:45.525
in Riverside, and our manager
cannot be located.

11:45.543 --> 11:47.160
Huh.

11:47.194 --> 11:50.196
You know, let me, uh,
let me call corporate,

11:50.214 --> 11:52.049
and I'll let you know.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.767
Great. Thanks, Chuck.

11:53.801 --> 11:55.135
Bye.

11:56.871 --> 11:59.873
I know how to find the Viper.

12:01.209 --> 12:03.010
CHUCK:
So, I've talked to corporate,

12:03.044 --> 12:05.512
and it turns out that
the Salesperson of the Year

12:05.546 --> 12:07.047
and winner of the coveted

12:07.065 --> 12:09.283
weekend in Riverside,
California,

12:09.317 --> 12:10.684
is...

12:10.718 --> 12:11.685
(sighs)

12:11.719 --> 12:14.187
Morgan Grimes!
(clapping)

12:14.221 --> 12:17.391
Are you pulling
my considerable chain?!

12:17.425 --> 12:19.943
Grimes has barely shown
his face in weeks!

12:19.994 --> 12:21.945
I love the boy, but it's true.

12:21.996 --> 12:23.597
No, no, no.
Guys, guys, guys!

12:23.631 --> 12:25.248
Do you not see
what's happening?

12:25.283 --> 12:26.533
This is a fix!

12:26.567 --> 12:28.035
LESTER:
It's obviously fixed.

12:28.069 --> 12:29.536
Now, you know what?

12:29.570 --> 12:30.921
I revolt.

12:30.955 --> 12:32.706
I revolt!
Who's with me?!

12:32.740 --> 12:33.790
OTHER EMPLOYEES:
Yeah!

12:33.841 --> 12:35.125
(employees cheering)

12:35.176 --> 12:37.644
Li-Listen, I'm
disappointed, too.

12:37.679 --> 12:42.282
But aren't we all still lucky
to be here?

12:42.317 --> 12:45.118
Working in a great place,
in a down economy?

12:45.153 --> 12:48.421
Surrounded by our great-looking
Buy More co-workers?

12:48.439 --> 12:50.357
Selling fine goods
to the few people

12:50.391 --> 12:51.641
who haven't discovered Amazon.

12:51.693 --> 12:54.260
So what if we just use
this as a wake-up call

12:54.278 --> 12:57.397
and vow to work even harder
for the next year?

12:57.432 --> 12:58.732
EMPLOYEES:
Yeah!

12:58.766 --> 13:01.434
(employees murmuring approval)

13:01.452 --> 13:03.236
CHUCK:
This is...

13:03.270 --> 13:05.405
(chuckling):
I don't know what this is,

13:05.440 --> 13:07.808
but I-I like
the new work ethic, Jeff.

13:07.842 --> 13:09.142
You keep that up.

13:09.177 --> 13:10.276
I gotta go.

13:10.294 --> 13:11.611
(employees cheering)

13:13.498 --> 13:15.465
CHUCK:
<i>So, here's the plan:</i>

13:15.500 --> 13:17.467
We send Morgan to Riverside.

13:17.502 --> 13:20.120
We make it as public
as possible,

13:20.154 --> 13:22.956
so that the Viper
hunts him down.

13:22.990 --> 13:25.675
But before he can strike, we do.

13:25.727 --> 13:27.427
And after all this is over,

13:27.461 --> 13:29.963
Morgan can be just
a regular guy again.

13:29.997 --> 13:32.299
MORGAN: Okay, yeah,
put myself out there,

13:32.333 --> 13:34.300
allow myself to be hunted.

13:34.318 --> 13:35.302
- Mm.
- Yeah.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.636
Now, not to sound like a baby,

13:36.654 --> 13:38.138
but without the Intersect,

13:38.172 --> 13:41.341
it does seem a bit more...
terrifying.

13:41.376 --> 13:44.277
It won't be as hard
as you think. (pats back)

13:48.366 --> 13:50.117
(indistinct chatter)

13:59.727 --> 14:01.011
Hi.

14:01.045 --> 14:03.363
I'm Morgan Grimes.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.101
(computer beeps twice)

14:23.830 --> 14:25.314
Oh, look at all
these nice people.

14:25.348 --> 14:26.982
Wonder which one is
trying to kill me.

14:27.016 --> 14:27.983
(microphone feedback squeals)

14:28.017 --> 14:30.469
Hello, Buy Most-ers!

14:30.503 --> 14:31.637
(crowd cheering)

14:31.671 --> 14:35.274
And welcome to all the
salespeople of the year.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.409
Now, I say "salespeople,"
because

14:37.443 --> 14:39.027
some of you are even ladies.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.612
So, good for you.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.981
Another crack
in that ceiling.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.317
We're going to have
to get that thing fixed.

14:45.335 --> 14:47.152
I'm just joshing, just joshing.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.788
Grab a yard of margaritas
and get your mingle on!

14:49.822 --> 14:51.340
(crowd whooping)

14:51.374 --> 14:54.176
Well, Morgan, you ready
to get your mingle on?

14:54.210 --> 14:56.678
So ready to get my
mingle on. Thank you.

14:56.713 --> 14:57.863
Casey, you good?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.847
We're up and running.

14:58.881 --> 15:01.033
Remember, I need
pulse bio-feedback.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.035
The finger-pads don't give us
lie detection

15:03.069 --> 15:04.803
unless you're actually
touching the subject.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.022
Got it. Touch the subject,
see if they're lying.

15:07.056 --> 15:09.191
If they are, perhaps
they want to kill Chuck.

15:09.225 --> 15:11.676
And if they aren't, perhaps
I grab another crab-puff.

15:11.694 --> 15:12.728
Okay, stay alert.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.529
All we know is
that the Viper kills

15:14.564 --> 15:15.697
at close range.

15:15.732 --> 15:17.115
That's why he's
so accurate,

15:17.150 --> 15:18.850
but that only means
no sniping.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.225
He could use poison, so
just watch your food and

15:20.250 --> 15:21.450
drink intake, okay?

15:22.372 --> 15:24.356
Okay, he has strangled,
knifed, drowned,

15:24.390 --> 15:25.707
and there is
a pool here.

15:25.742 --> 15:27.025
So, you know?

15:27.043 --> 15:29.594
Got it.
Lots of ways to die today.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.930
Okay. Once we
identify the target,

15:31.964 --> 15:34.066
I'll move in and
neutralize him.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.919
Yeah, not normal
husband-wife conversation.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.519
(men chuckling)
Hey, how you guys doing?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.421
Morgan Grimes, Burbank Buy More.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.555

15:57.573 --> 15:59.241

15:59.275 --> 16:01.760
Prettiest place

16:01.794 --> 16:04.796

born, and, uh, where,

16:04.831 --> 16:07.766
God willing, I will die.

No. Always get red

16:31.190 --> 16:33.108

19:09.849 --> 19:11.816
who can't be away
from her family.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.019
It's just been a while,
you know.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.638
I think I've been a mom
and a wife for so long, I...

19:16.689 --> 19:17.973
I think I've sort
of forgotten

19:18.024 --> 19:19.991
how to be a regular
person, you know?

19:20.026 --> 19:21.643
Oh, I do.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.727
I really do.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.279
I used to know how to have fun.

19:24.313 --> 19:26.097
I came to one of these things

19:26.115 --> 19:27.532
before I was married--

19:27.567 --> 19:32.153
Crazy Bob and I led 18 people
in a midnight skinny dip!

19:34.123 --> 19:35.106
Clear.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.491
Well, it sounds like

19:36.542 --> 19:37.776
you're the lady that I'm
going to be sticking with.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.127
You know everybody here.

19:39.161 --> 19:41.630
Oh, better. I know what everyone
looks like naked.

19:41.664 --> 19:42.964
(both laugh)

19:42.999 --> 19:44.816
(all clamoring)
You're gonna go in...

19:44.850 --> 19:45.850
No, no!

19:45.885 --> 19:47.419
CHUCK:
No, no, no, no!

19:47.453 --> 19:48.954
(all cheering)

19:48.988 --> 19:49.838
Oh, my God.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.434
(gasps)

20:02.468 --> 20:03.468
Are you okay?!

20:03.486 --> 20:04.636
I'm fine!

20:04.654 --> 20:06.187
(crowd whooping)

20:14.046 --> 20:15.480
♪ ♪

20:27.693 --> 20:30.045
(computer trilling softly)

20:30.096 --> 20:32.047
Wait a minute.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.298
Oh, my gosh.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.216
I have to ask you something

20:35.267 --> 20:36.801
man-to-man here, okay?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.536
Did I seriously like
Phantom Menace?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.605
Because I would rather
scratch out my eyeballs

20:40.640 --> 20:43.541
than to listen to that
Jar Jar Binks anymore.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.809
Ai-yi-yi.

20:44.843 --> 20:47.145
I don't know, maybe
my brain has changed.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.513
Mm...

20:48.531 --> 20:50.015
You know what hasn't changed?

20:50.049 --> 20:51.516
My feelings for Alex.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.818
Yeah, if there's one thing
I remember, it's that

20:53.853 --> 20:56.554
I was an ass,
an-and that I love her.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.024
The crazy thing is,
she changed her phone number.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.376
So, just wondering
maybe you can help me out?

21:01.410 --> 21:03.662
And tell her what, that
you had a secret supercomputer

21:03.696 --> 21:05.664
in your head,
made you into a jackass?

21:05.698 --> 21:07.532
No.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.050
Nothing left to say.
It's over.

21:09.085 --> 21:10.719
(sighs)

21:12.204 --> 21:13.505
Hey, oh...

21:14.807 --> 21:16.925
I lied. Start with
the originals.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.243
You'd love those.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.245
- Really?
- Mm.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.780
Thanks, man.

21:21.814 --> 21:22.764
Thanks.

21:22.815 --> 21:23.948
Oh, hey.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.883
Just so you know,

21:25.901 --> 21:28.653
Darth Vader-- Luke's father.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.572
Leia is his sister.

21:32.441 --> 21:34.259
Still mad.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.730
(laughter)

21:38.748 --> 21:40.999
So, all of a sudden, right,
all-all of a sudden,

21:41.033 --> 21:44.619
after years and years
of lunacy, Jeff is smart,

21:44.670 --> 21:46.337
because it turns out

21:46.372 --> 21:48.740
he'd been sleeping
in his van for years

21:48.774 --> 21:50.258
with the engine
still running.

21:50.292 --> 21:53.428
The guy wasn't a moron;
he was actually brain-damaged.

21:53.462 --> 21:56.264
(laughter)

21:56.298 --> 21:59.100
Two of our Buy Morons
actually contracted scurvy.

21:59.135 --> 22:00.351
- What?
- Yeah. Scurvy?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.353
Turns out they'd been subsisting

22:02.388 --> 22:04.589
solely on the candy
from the snack aisle.

22:04.607 --> 22:06.224
They didn't even know
anything was wrong

22:06.258 --> 22:07.525
until they
started seeing

22:07.560 --> 22:09.694
their teeth in the Jujubes.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.597
(laughter)

22:12.615 --> 22:14.932
Man, the, uh, Buy More
never fails

22:14.950 --> 22:16.701
to provide
dinner table fodder.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.703
LINDA:
My kids ask

22:18.738 --> 22:20.371
for funny customer stories

22:20.406 --> 22:22.106
every night at bed.
STU: Hey, hey, hey.

22:22.124 --> 22:24.642
Best job ever.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.994
Hear, hear.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.945
Cheers.
Cheers.

22:27.963 --> 22:28.946
Oh, who needs another round?

22:28.964 --> 22:30.665
I do.
Me, me, me, me, me.

22:30.716 --> 22:32.116
I'll come with you, honey.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.672
I kind of love it here.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.958
I know. They're, like, the
nicest people in the world.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.309
Yeah, we've
checked everybody,

22:41.343 --> 22:43.294
and everyone is exactly
who they say they are.

22:43.312 --> 22:45.463
It's amazing.

22:45.481 --> 22:48.199
And here we are, lying,
all suspicious.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.635
You know, I think Jane
wants to be my friend.

22:50.653 --> 22:52.821
She asked me out
for coffee.

22:52.855 --> 22:54.639
She's the Viper.

22:54.657 --> 22:56.858
SARAH: What? No, no, no, no.
She passed the test.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.311
And I... I think that she
just really likes me.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.648
Honey, you're right.

23:03.682 --> 23:05.583
Of course.
Of course she does. Duh.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.919
It's just my stupid suspicious
spy brain, you know?

23:07.953 --> 23:09.504
(sighs) Well, it
doesn't matter anyway.

23:09.538 --> 23:10.988
I mean, I'm not really sure

23:11.006 --> 23:13.191
what type of friendship
is founded on lies.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.843
But we should focus anyway.

23:14.877 --> 23:17.128
I'm sure the Viper
is zeroed in on you by now.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.546
We need
to lure him out

23:18.597 --> 23:20.932
and get you alone
and vulnerable.

23:22.468 --> 23:23.685
(laughter)

23:23.719 --> 23:25.503
CHUCK:
Ladies and gentlemen...

23:25.521 --> 23:27.055
ladies and gentlemen.
What, what, what?

23:27.106 --> 23:28.273
What?
What?

23:28.307 --> 23:30.208
I've had one too many,
and I'm going to bed.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.509
Come on, Morgan.
What?! No.

23:31.527 --> 23:33.611
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, there's poker later,

23:33.646 --> 23:36.397
and probably another
less-clothed swim party.

23:36.448 --> 23:38.066
Whoo!
Huh?

23:38.117 --> 23:40.051
I would love nothing more

23:40.085 --> 23:42.887
than to see you do
a naked cannonball, Irv.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.689
Keep it... keep it on,
keep it on, keep it on.

23:44.707 --> 23:46.074
I need to lie down,
you know.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.792
I think the sciatica's
acting up.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.911
Yeah.
I think I'll call it, too.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.029
- Bob!
- What?!

23:52.047 --> 23:53.731
Good night.
Come on.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.166
See you tomorrow.
(groans)

23:55.201 --> 23:58.202
Yeah, I got to call my family
before they hit the hay.

23:58.220 --> 24:00.505
Yeah, one of my kids
had a big game today.

24:00.539 --> 24:01.756
Oh.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.943
That's a lie, Chuck.

24:09.181 --> 24:13.067
BOB: <i>No, Omaha's no St. Louis,</i>
<i>but we have a good time.</i>

24:13.102 --> 24:16.905
Sally, in her day,
ooh, what a looker.

24:16.939 --> 24:19.274
Yeah, Corn Princess
in 1987.

24:19.325 --> 24:22.260
Nope, still lying.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.862
Oh. (chuckles)

24:23.896 --> 24:27.115
Well, this is me.
Oh.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.002
Guess I'm just
going to be in here.

24:31.036 --> 24:32.737
All by my lonesome.

24:32.755 --> 24:34.939
Well, sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.941
(chuckles) Yeah.

24:38.878 --> 24:39.844
Grimes.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.145
Huh?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.814
I shouldn't have joked
about bedbugs.

24:42.848 --> 24:45.149
I mean, they cost
the hospitality industry

24:45.184 --> 24:46.951
millions of dollars a year.

24:50.055 --> 24:52.974
Wrong thing to say.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.209
(sighs) Yep.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.678
I'm alone and vulnerable.

25:20.135 --> 25:21.636
Hello, Sarah.

25:21.670 --> 25:23.120
Come in.

25:25.257 --> 25:26.674
I've been
watching you.

25:28.627 --> 25:31.646
You've got a cute
little persona going on.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.065
But I can spot a girl
in a costume.

25:35.651 --> 25:37.802
You know, I'm not
what I seem, either.

25:43.993 --> 25:46.194
(yells, grunts)

25:49.915 --> 25:51.032
Yeah.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.718
I like costumes, too.

25:58.857 --> 26:00.391
You're not
going anywhere

26:00.426 --> 26:02.827
until you hippity-hop
over here.

26:07.599 --> 26:08.716
It's party time.

26:13.138 --> 26:14.722
Sarah!

26:14.773 --> 26:16.340
It was the bartender!

26:19.979 --> 26:23.514
Yeah, not everybody here
is normal.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.818
(chuckles)

26:29.557 --> 26:30.702
Whoa!
Yes!

26:30.727 --> 26:31.927
I'm not gonna die.

26:32.809 --> 26:34.493
Hey, Viper.

26:34.528 --> 26:35.862
Suck it.

26:37.130 --> 26:39.148
- Can I go home now?
- Yeah, buddy.

26:39.182 --> 26:40.900
You're good.
We're not letting this guy go

26:40.934 --> 26:42.635
till he acknowledges
the hit's been called off.

26:42.669 --> 26:45.504
Which he's being very stubborn
about doing, I might add.

26:45.539 --> 26:47.857
Go ahead, nod your head.
Do it.

26:47.908 --> 26:49.442
Yep, hit's off.

26:49.476 --> 26:50.610
No more killy-killy.

26:50.644 --> 26:52.328
This is not how it's done. Hmm?

26:52.362 --> 26:53.613
SARAH: First, we have
to get Decker

26:53.647 --> 26:55.331
to rescind the kill order,

26:55.365 --> 26:56.666
but we'll handle that, Morgan,

26:56.700 --> 26:58.701
so, you know,
I think you're free to go.

26:58.752 --> 27:00.486
Hmm. And if you go
anywhere near Alex,

27:00.520 --> 27:02.455
you're going to be on
another hit list. Hmm?

27:02.489 --> 27:03.873
(muttering)

27:03.924 --> 27:05.374
(groans)

27:06.426 --> 27:08.010
I'm sorry, buddy.
You doing okay?

27:08.045 --> 27:09.178
MORGAN:
Yeah.

27:09.212 --> 27:11.130
You know, I just...
wish he'd give me

27:11.164 --> 27:12.548
the number
so I can explain to her.

27:12.599 --> 27:13.716
CHUCK:
Don't give up, you know?

27:13.767 --> 27:14.934
You got to keep trying.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.369
He's a tough one to crack.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.223
You know, uh...

27:21.275 --> 27:23.309
it's easier to ask
forgiveness than permission.

27:24.845 --> 27:27.179
- Mm-hmm.
- Truer words will never be spoken.

27:28.115 --> 27:30.016
A stitch in time saves nine.

27:30.050 --> 27:32.418
Hmm? Lead a horse
to water.

27:33.620 --> 27:35.154
Just...

27:35.188 --> 27:36.522
(whistles)

27:37.891 --> 27:40.393
SARAH: Hey, I... I got
to make a call.

27:40.427 --> 27:42.161
Jane asked me for a drink,

27:42.195 --> 27:44.046
and this is going to take
a while, so I have to...

27:44.081 --> 27:45.364
No, no, no, no. Go.

27:45.399 --> 27:47.433
Casey and I can take care
of the Viper handoff.

27:47.467 --> 27:48.868
Really? You mean, like, I can go

27:48.902 --> 27:51.437
and have an actual
normal friend?

27:51.471 --> 27:52.805
Yeah. Babe, come on.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.074
We saved a man's life not
having to use the Intersect;

27:55.108 --> 27:56.425
just awesome
husband/wife spy work.

27:56.476 --> 27:58.644
Maybe we can have some
normal friends, too.

27:58.679 --> 28:01.147
Okay. Well, I'm going to go
have a drink with a friend

28:01.181 --> 28:03.049
like a real live person.

28:03.083 --> 28:04.734
Have a great time.
Thanks.

28:06.403 --> 28:08.421
Jeff, you have shown
incredible improvement

28:08.455 --> 28:11.107
in motor skills, language
ability, reflexes, memory.

28:11.158 --> 28:13.025
It's like
you're an actual

28:13.059 --> 28:14.026
person now.

28:14.061 --> 28:15.778
Thank you.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.030
I have started to see

28:18.065 --> 28:19.432
a lot of things more clearly.

28:20.467 --> 28:21.534
Hey, guys.

28:21.568 --> 28:22.868
Hey, Mommy.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.286
Hi, muffin.

28:24.338 --> 28:26.472
Mommy missed you.
Yes, she did.

28:26.506 --> 28:28.741
Babe, I have never seen
such a perfect case study

28:28.759 --> 28:30.176
for an article
on the effects

28:30.210 --> 28:32.294
of multiyear carbon
monoxide poisoning.

28:32.346 --> 28:34.130
- We could get published.
ELLIE: That's so interesting.

28:34.181 --> 28:35.581
Jeff, why don't you
come by the hospital?

28:35.599 --> 28:36.716
We'll take a look.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.050
Let me see
your belly.

28:38.085 --> 28:39.918
Let me see your belly.
I could eat you.

28:39.936 --> 28:41.771
Let's go out here
and see some fun stuff.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.973
Your woman is not happy.

28:44.024 --> 28:46.092
What are you talking about?

28:46.126 --> 28:48.794
Fresh air has made me intuitive.

28:48.829 --> 28:50.496
That woman...

28:50.530 --> 28:52.164
wants to be home
with her child.

28:52.199 --> 28:54.834
She'll never say it,
but it's true.

29:00.791 --> 29:03.108
- Hey. Alex.
- I am not here to talk to you.

29:03.126 --> 29:04.477
I'm here to see my dad.

29:04.511 --> 29:07.913
Look, I just wanted
to apologize, that's all.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.016
There's nothing you can say
to make it okay.

29:10.050 --> 29:12.418
You are just not the man
I thought I loved.

29:12.452 --> 29:13.803
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

29:13.837 --> 29:15.588
Hey. Hey.

29:15.622 --> 29:18.124
You want the truth?

29:18.158 --> 29:19.792
You ready?

29:19.810 --> 29:21.761
I had a supercomputer
in my head, okay?

29:21.795 --> 29:23.179
And it was melting my brain.

29:46.420 --> 29:47.953
Keep walking.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.672
Normal thoughts.

29:50.757 --> 29:54.326
So, how do you like
working private sector?

29:54.361 --> 29:55.928
It's hard, right?

29:55.962 --> 29:57.696
Figuring everything out,

29:57.731 --> 29:58.898
choosing the right

29:58.932 --> 30:00.566
small business
accounting program.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.169
You're probably not
feeling too chatty.

30:03.203 --> 30:07.039
Probably feeling bad
we took down the best so easily.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.180
Probably too easily.

30:16.616 --> 30:18.551
We were supposed to catch you.

30:28.912 --> 30:29.962
Sarah, wait. Don't move.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.330
Oh, my God. What?

30:31.364 --> 30:33.532
Look, I know we're trying to
be normal people and all,

30:33.550 --> 30:35.534
but if we were in spy mode,
we'd probably think

30:35.552 --> 30:36.836
it was kind of
interesting timing

30:36.870 --> 30:38.204
that you made
a new friend...

30:38.238 --> 30:40.706
I'm Jane.
who wanted to hang out with you

30:40.724 --> 30:41.707
<i>immediately post-mission.</i>

30:41.725 --> 30:44.376
A new friend who was
as good as I was

30:44.411 --> 30:45.878
<i>at passing a lie detector.</i>

30:45.896 --> 30:47.730
CHUCK: <i>And we might wonder</i>
<i>if the Viper</i>

30:47.764 --> 30:50.232
<i>didn't use a decoy,</i>
<i>like we did,</i>

30:50.267 --> 30:52.918
to make Morgan feel safe
and come out of hiding.

30:52.953 --> 30:55.588
And we might think that
getting rid of his guards

30:55.622 --> 30:58.357
by, say, planting a car bomb,

30:58.391 --> 31:00.776
might be a really
great way to go.

31:03.597 --> 31:05.865
(beeping)

31:05.899 --> 31:07.900
Okay, here's a spy thought:

31:09.336 --> 31:10.970
Don't move your foot.

31:11.004 --> 31:12.004
Okay.

31:16.259 --> 31:18.928
I'm looking for Morgan Grimes.

31:23.747 --> 31:24.562
You have to understand

31:24.563 --> 31:27.039
this all happened
a couple years ago, okay?

31:27.040 --> 31:28.440
Now, I can't give you
names and details,

31:28.474 --> 31:29.658
'cause it's confidential--
that sort of thing--

31:29.693 --> 31:30.743
but there were e-mails,

31:30.777 --> 31:32.027
and there were
supercomputers, okay?

31:32.078 --> 31:34.046
A supercomputer
wound up in my brain.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.164
And I zoomed.
(imitates whooshing)

31:35.198 --> 31:36.432
That's my word,
not theirs, okay?

31:36.466 --> 31:38.367
But the supercomputer
that I got was flawed,

31:38.418 --> 31:40.452
which is why all this sort
of behavior was happening.

31:40.486 --> 31:42.121
I'm really sorry.
You have to believe me.

31:42.155 --> 31:43.455
My brain was melting.

31:43.489 --> 31:45.157
You know?

31:45.191 --> 31:46.825
You look a little
overwhelmed.

31:46.860 --> 31:48.394
I'll let you process
that for a second there.

31:51.097 --> 31:54.466
JANE: I'm sure the manager's
around here somewhere.

31:55.685 --> 31:57.553
I'll find him.

31:57.604 --> 31:59.338
- Got to go now.
- No, Morgan. What are you doing?

31:59.356 --> 32:01.523
- Come with me. Just come with me.
- Seriously. You always do this.

32:01.558 --> 32:02.841
(muffled shouting)

32:06.112 --> 32:10.082
You little barbarian
son of a bitch.

32:10.116 --> 32:11.984
(engine idling)

32:14.020 --> 32:16.021
(gas hissing)

32:24.864 --> 32:26.665
Oh. Help, help!

32:26.699 --> 32:27.666
Help!

32:27.701 --> 32:28.717
Skip, pull the
fire alarm!

32:29.903 --> 32:32.054
(alarm ringing,
people murmuring)

32:32.088 --> 32:33.305
Someone plug the hose!

32:33.340 --> 32:35.374
Everyone run to safety!
I'm saving you!

32:35.392 --> 32:37.509
I make no apologies for
any of this, Jeffrey.

32:37.543 --> 32:39.044
I-I just needed
you back, man.

32:39.079 --> 32:40.896
BIG MIKE:
Pineapple!

32:40.930 --> 32:42.564
(clamoring,
alarm continues ringing)

32:46.552 --> 32:48.737
(alarm beeping)

32:55.228 --> 32:57.029
(beeping)
Yep. Yep.

32:57.063 --> 32:58.080
That's-That's a bomb.

32:59.432 --> 33:00.232
(beeping)

33:00.266 --> 33:01.233
And it's a nice one.

33:01.251 --> 33:02.734
Okay.

33:04.237 --> 33:05.537
Listen to me.

33:05.571 --> 33:06.755
This is what's
happening, okay?

33:06.790 --> 33:08.040
There is an
elusive assassin,

33:08.074 --> 33:10.426
and she is
hunting me, okay?

33:10.460 --> 33:12.244
You are legitimately insane.

33:12.278 --> 33:13.745
What? No.

33:13.763 --> 33:14.880
No, no, no, no.

33:14.914 --> 33:17.916
Please, please,
look, look, look, look.

33:20.987 --> 33:22.388
Okay, okay.
Okay.

33:22.422 --> 33:23.889
It's all right, stay calm.
She's there.

33:23.923 --> 33:25.057
I know, I know.

33:25.091 --> 33:26.825
(cell phone ringing)

33:27.861 --> 33:29.361
I'm gonna rip your face off.

33:29.396 --> 33:31.096
MORGAN:
No, shh. Casey, listen to me.

33:31.131 --> 33:32.531
We have the wrong person, okay?

33:32.565 --> 33:34.066
The real Viper is a lady.

33:34.100 --> 33:35.801
And she's here,
hunting us.

33:38.171 --> 33:40.005
Northeast corner of the store.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.623
Get Alex to the broom closet.

33:41.658 --> 33:44.159
You want to live, you're gonna
take care of my daughter.

33:44.210 --> 33:45.711
Of course.

33:45.745 --> 33:47.129
Listen to me.

33:47.163 --> 33:49.102
We're gonna move when
I say move, okay?

33:49.127 --> 33:50.327
Okay.

33:51.835 --> 33:53.285
Move.

33:55.338 --> 33:56.672
(beeping)

33:56.723 --> 33:58.357
(cell phone chimes)
Chuck, I'm getting some text.

33:58.391 --> 33:59.591
Jane is in the Buy More,

33:59.626 --> 34:00.642
and Casey's locked
in the castle.

34:00.677 --> 34:02.294
Ooh, man.

34:02.328 --> 34:04.663
Okay, well, tell them we'll be
there in less than 90 seconds.

34:04.697 --> 34:06.999
Okay. Uh, you remember

34:07.033 --> 34:08.233
how to do this, right?

34:08.268 --> 34:09.534
Yeah. Yeah.

34:09.569 --> 34:10.652
Maybe, kinda, yeah.

34:10.687 --> 34:12.704
I think so.
It's normally the red wire.

34:12.739 --> 34:14.473
Or the green wire.

34:14.507 --> 34:17.342
It's normally the red or the
green wire; I'm not really sure.

34:17.377 --> 34:19.811
I want you to wait
in here, all right?

34:19.829 --> 34:20.812
Okay.

34:20.830 --> 34:22.246
Don't you move
till I get back.

34:22.282 --> 34:23.315
She's after me.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.550
I'm not gonna put
you in danger.

34:24.583 --> 34:25.784
Okay.

34:25.818 --> 34:28.152
I love you.

34:28.170 --> 34:30.289
You don't have to
say it back at me.

34:30.322 --> 34:32.541
Would've been romantic,
but, uh, it's fine.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.592
It's fine. Good.

34:38.331 --> 34:40.831
(sighs)

34:40.850 --> 34:43.469
God, I can't believe I trusted
Jane to be who she said she was.

34:43.503 --> 34:45.536
I must have been really
desperate for a normal friend.

34:45.572 --> 34:47.339
Oh, hey, hey.

34:47.357 --> 34:49.108
Don't-Don't beat yourself up.

34:49.141 --> 34:51.360
And don't move your foot,

34:51.393 --> 34:53.712
really, because
this is a very

34:53.746 --> 34:55.847
nasty bomb.

34:55.864 --> 34:57.516
- Up with the leg. Up with the leg.
- Okay.

34:57.534 --> 34:59.184
Up with the leg.
Keep that leg!

34:59.219 --> 35:00.402
Up with that leg. There we go.

35:00.453 --> 35:02.454
There we are.

35:13.866 --> 35:16.502
(cell phone ringing)

35:16.536 --> 35:18.137
Hello.

35:18.171 --> 35:19.771
Jane? Jane, it's Sarah.

35:19.806 --> 35:21.440
Um, I'm so sorry
I'm running late.

35:21.474 --> 35:22.841
I'm having
a really bad day,

35:22.876 --> 35:25.544
and I... I just need
somebody to talk to.

35:25.562 --> 35:28.430
Well, just come
to the restaurant.

35:28.481 --> 35:29.731
We'll workshop it.

35:29.766 --> 35:31.016
No, I...

35:31.050 --> 35:33.585
I'm so upset,
I don't think I can drive.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.154
Well, just get in the car,

35:35.188 --> 35:36.989
turn it on
and get here.

35:37.023 --> 35:38.824
I can't. My hands are shaking.

35:38.858 --> 35:41.410
Well, honey, look,
I'm really sorry, okay?

35:41.444 --> 35:43.495
I'm not gonna be able
to help you right now.

35:43.530 --> 35:45.330
I got to go.

35:45.365 --> 35:47.533
No, no, wait. Jane, Jane,
I want to tell you something.

35:47.567 --> 35:49.835
I-I feel, I feel really badly.

35:49.869 --> 35:52.738
You've been so open and honest
and sweet with me,

35:52.772 --> 35:54.739
and I'm so excited
to have a new friend.

35:54.757 --> 35:56.575
Yeah?

35:56.609 --> 35:58.177
(gun cocks)

35:58.211 --> 36:00.546
But I've been lying to you.

36:00.580 --> 36:02.097
About a couple of things.

36:02.131 --> 36:04.082
(gun cocks)
I'm a spy.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.418
Boy, it feels good
to say that to a real friend.

36:06.452 --> 36:08.387
By the way, you're amazing
at what you do.

36:08.421 --> 36:10.189
I really trusted you.

36:10.223 --> 36:12.224
And I don't do that
very often.

36:12.258 --> 36:13.458
Well, you shouldn't.

36:14.444 --> 36:15.727
Wait, wait, stop!

36:15.761 --> 36:16.761
I have your bomb.

36:17.780 --> 36:19.698
Which means it's disarmed.

36:19.732 --> 36:21.700
Bye.

36:27.574 --> 36:28.790
Thanks, honey.

36:28.825 --> 36:31.143
I kind of thought maybe stepping
into the middle of this

36:31.177 --> 36:33.946
might have been a bad idea
after all, so...

36:34.914 --> 36:37.616
I miss knowing kung fu.

36:42.626 --> 36:43.847
Remarkable work.

36:43.872 --> 36:45.102
The Viper's perfect record

36:45.414 --> 36:46.831
has been broken.

36:46.882 --> 36:48.466
Uh, boom.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.650
Suck it.

36:49.685 --> 36:50.985
Sorry about that, sir.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.988
I'm obviously relieved
the mix-up was righted.

36:54.023 --> 36:55.490
I would never
have wanted you

36:55.524 --> 36:58.726
to complete your mission
after the CIA called it off.

36:58.761 --> 37:00.762
I am one of the good guys.

37:00.796 --> 37:02.497
Right. So, in front of
all of these witnesses,

37:02.531 --> 37:04.132
on a recorded feed,
the hit is off?

37:04.166 --> 37:05.666
Yes.

37:05.701 --> 37:07.101
It's official, the hit is off.

37:07.135 --> 37:09.270
All right,
our business here is done.

37:09.304 --> 37:10.738
Good luck running a spy business

37:10.773 --> 37:13.074
with no Intersect, huh?

37:13.108 --> 37:15.109
See ya never.

37:15.144 --> 37:17.178
He's a quippy bastard.

37:17.212 --> 37:18.979
So can someone get
us out of this hole?

37:18.997 --> 37:19.980
My pleasure.

37:19.998 --> 37:21.516
Follow me.

37:23.151 --> 37:25.586
Decker took
that well.

37:25.621 --> 37:28.122
Yeah, he did.

37:28.156 --> 37:29.841
I'll take
care of it.

37:37.883 --> 37:40.601
So, we need to talk.

37:40.636 --> 37:41.836
Whatever.

37:41.854 --> 37:44.072
We're no longer
friends, I get it.

37:44.106 --> 37:45.506
Like I care.

37:45.541 --> 37:46.774
I do care.

37:46.809 --> 37:49.176
I wish you were
a better person.

37:49.194 --> 37:51.028
But unfortunately,
you need to learn

37:51.063 --> 37:53.314
there are repercussions
for your actions.

37:53.348 --> 37:54.315
Mm.

37:54.349 --> 37:56.517
So, you're under arrest.

37:59.521 --> 38:01.289
What?

38:01.323 --> 38:02.690
For what?

38:02.724 --> 38:04.358
Attempted homicide.

38:04.393 --> 38:06.661
Jeff.

38:08.363 --> 38:09.397
Jeff!

38:09.431 --> 38:10.715
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:10.749 --> 38:12.800
Anything you say
can and will be

38:12.835 --> 38:15.470
used against you
in a court of law.

38:16.889 --> 38:18.739
ALEX:
<i>Morgan,</i>

38:18.774 --> 38:20.508
we're not gonna
get back together.

38:20.542 --> 38:23.010
You told me that you were
done with the spy life,

38:23.044 --> 38:26.147
and clearly you lied to me
in a million different ways.

38:27.683 --> 38:31.686
You're my hero,
but you are not my boyfriend.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.087
Okay.

38:33.122 --> 38:34.489
I'm sorry.

38:34.523 --> 38:36.691
No, it's okay.
I get it.

38:36.725 --> 38:38.860
But, um, we can
still be friends.

38:38.894 --> 38:42.396
And I'm really glad
we're both here tonight.

38:42.431 --> 38:44.732
Me, too.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.284
Oh, hey. We're putting
out some hors d'oeuvres,

38:46.335 --> 38:47.668
if you guys
want to come in.

38:47.703 --> 38:50.505
Is my dad here yet?

38:50.539 --> 38:52.406
Uh, he's coming a little late.

38:52.424 --> 38:55.376
DECKER (over earpiece):
You haven't said anything yet

38:55.410 --> 38:57.545
that's made me think you're
still the man for the job.

38:57.579 --> 39:00.214
I have a reputation to repair.

39:00.249 --> 39:01.516
This will get done.

39:01.550 --> 39:03.100
You need to
understand, however,

39:03.135 --> 39:05.353
that I have to
protect my cover.

39:05.387 --> 39:06.771
Obviously. Which means...

39:06.805 --> 39:09.857
Neutralizing everyone
who knows who I am.

39:09.892 --> 39:11.893
Walker, Grimes, Casey,

39:11.927 --> 39:14.529
Bartowski, Casey's daughter.

39:14.563 --> 39:15.863
(gun cocks)

39:17.432 --> 39:21.102
You have approval on everyone
but Bartowski and Walker.

39:21.136 --> 39:23.120
Now get it done.

39:24.156 --> 39:25.540
(silenced gunshots)

39:29.578 --> 39:30.795
John Casey.

39:33.949 --> 39:35.249
Your life is over if you...

39:35.284 --> 39:37.284
(silenced gunshots)

39:53.202 --> 39:54.368
So, tell me
about your day.

39:54.403 --> 39:55.603
Fun parts only, please.

39:55.637 --> 39:57.304
Mm. Fun parts only.

39:57.322 --> 39:59.640
Well, this week,
I had to pose as Morgan Grimes.

39:59.675 --> 40:00.858
(laughter)

40:00.909 --> 40:02.026
You would need some serious
hormone injections

40:02.077 --> 40:03.027
to get a beard like that.

40:03.078 --> 40:04.445
Okay, okay.

40:04.479 --> 40:06.414
Well, fortunately for me,
my wife likes me baby smooth.

40:06.448 --> 40:08.499
I do. My husband was
the best human target

40:08.533 --> 40:10.484
a wife could
ever ask for.

40:10.502 --> 40:11.836
Aw, this is fun.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.454
Talking openly
about our days.

40:13.488 --> 40:14.705
It's the best.

40:14.756 --> 40:16.090
(door closes)
Hey, everybody.

40:16.124 --> 40:17.541
Sorry I'm late.

40:17.593 --> 40:19.794
No, perfect timing, man-- we
were about to sit down and eat.

40:19.828 --> 40:20.995
Here, I'll trade you.
Excellent. Thanks.

40:21.013 --> 40:22.630
Hey, Dad. Where were you?

40:22.664 --> 40:24.999
Oh, just had an errand to run.

40:25.033 --> 40:26.601
Oh.
Yeah.

40:29.538 --> 40:31.005
May I?
Sure.

40:31.023 --> 40:32.857
Cheers.

40:32.891 --> 40:36.176
♪ ♪

40:40.816 --> 40:42.850
Uh, I'd like to make a toast.

40:42.868 --> 40:46.120
Chuck and I have been
a little sad this week

40:46.154 --> 40:48.556
that we aren't normal people.

40:48.590 --> 40:50.658
I've been having a
hard time with the fact

40:50.692 --> 40:52.026
that I have no
real friends.

40:52.044 --> 40:54.962
But I look around here
at all of you today,

40:54.997 --> 40:57.665
and I realize that,
because of Chuck, I do.

40:57.699 --> 41:01.052
Nobody in the world is
closer than we all are.

41:01.086 --> 41:03.387
So, thank you
and cheers.

41:03.422 --> 41:04.872
ALL:
Cheers.

41:06.008 --> 41:08.175
I, too, have an
announcement.

41:08.209 --> 41:09.677
I'm going back to work.

41:09.711 --> 41:11.312
Well, what? Wait, seriously?

41:11.346 --> 41:12.980
I thought you were
happy at home.

41:13.015 --> 41:15.483
No, I was just putting
on a front, you know?

41:15.517 --> 41:17.118
I was going nuts.

41:17.152 --> 41:20.187
Ellie is stepping up and taking
care of baby Clara for awhile.

41:20.221 --> 41:21.355
Wow.
Yes, well,

41:21.389 --> 41:22.823
it was too soon for me
to go back, anyway.

41:22.858 --> 41:23.824
I missed her too much.

41:23.859 --> 41:26.410
Yeah. She's totally saving me.

41:26.445 --> 41:29.113
One more "Mommy and Me" class,
I would've lost my mind.

41:34.303 --> 41:35.269
Hey.

41:35.304 --> 41:36.270
Hey.

41:36.305 --> 41:37.705
I just wanted
to tell you

41:37.739 --> 41:39.006
that you could probably, uh,

41:39.041 --> 41:40.675
ixnay on the whole
killing me thing,

41:40.709 --> 41:42.877
because I'm not gonna
bother Alex anymore.

41:42.911 --> 41:43.878
Mm.

41:43.912 --> 41:45.179
You should move back in.

41:47.215 --> 41:48.683
Really?

41:50.719 --> 41:52.853
Got you a gift.

41:52.888 --> 41:55.856
Come on, really?

41:55.891 --> 41:58.476
<i>Indiana Jones.</i>

41:58.527 --> 41:59.760
I like these?

41:59.778 --> 42:01.062
You did.

42:01.096 --> 42:03.297
Are you holding out on me?
Is this the only three?

42:03.332 --> 42:05.299
You're not, like, keeping
the good ones for yourself or...

42:05.334 --> 42:08.035
Yeah. There's
just the three.

42:08.070 --> 42:09.070
Thanks, man.

42:09.988 --> 42:12.606
(knocking)

42:12.641 --> 42:14.208
Hey. I got it.

42:18.246 --> 42:20.581
Decker, what is this?

42:20.615 --> 42:21.632
We're looking for John Casey.

42:21.666 --> 42:22.883
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:23.952 --> 42:26.003
DECKER:
John Casey!

42:26.054 --> 42:27.588
You're under arrest.

42:27.622 --> 42:30.641
For murder.
