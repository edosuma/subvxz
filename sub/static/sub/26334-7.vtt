WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:06.206
WALSH: Job came in about
an hour ago from sanitation.

00:06.206 --> 00:08.141
DANNY: There was nothing else?
Just the head?

00:08.141 --> 00:11.812
So far. M.E.'s office
is on the way.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.313
Pretty decomposed.

00:13.313 --> 00:16.116
Why don't you go on up there
and have a closer look?

00:16.116 --> 00:18.318
He just said M.E.'s on the way.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.854
I'll look out
for them. Go on.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.861
When you were
taking the test,

00:27.861 --> 00:29.997
you ever think you'd be
climbing up a pile of garbage

00:29.997 --> 00:31.698
to get to a severed head?

00:31.698 --> 00:33.934
No. Thought I'd be more like

00:33.934 --> 00:37.504
Paul Newman
in Fort Apache, The Bronx.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.373
It was Cagney & Lacey for me.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.208
You know we could just retire,

00:41.208 --> 00:43.844
and go to a tropical island
and solve crimes there.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.112
We could,
but you would

00:45.112 --> 00:46.847
never survive outside
the five boroughs.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.348
That's true.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.985
Yeah, it's Mano Sangriento.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.320
Black hand?

00:53.320 --> 00:56.523
No, just the fingers.
But it was a hand.

00:56.523 --> 00:57.925
That's the calling card.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.459
Yeah. Now we're gonna
have to figure out

00:59.459 --> 01:01.662
why this guy lost his head.

01:01.662 --> 01:05.299
Jose Cortez, 30,
from Sunset Park.

01:05.299 --> 01:08.535
Cops found him in possession
of a half-ounce of cocaine.

01:08.535 --> 01:10.837
ERIN: Criminal possession
in the third degree.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.606
But Cortez has no priors,
so he's eligible

01:12.606 --> 01:14.007
for judicial diversion.

01:14.007 --> 01:17.277
So he'll get drug treatment
instead of jail time.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.379
And Schneiderman is on deck, so
no doubt she'll recommend rehab.

01:19.379 --> 01:21.415
You run a triple I check
to make sure he doesn't have

01:21.415 --> 01:22.749
a record outside of New York?

01:22.749 --> 01:25.319
His record's clean.
Legal aid's gonna ask for R.O.R.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.987
What do you want to do?

01:26.987 --> 01:28.388
I'll ask for 500 bail.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.890
She'll R.O.R. him anyway.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.291
And so it goes.

01:31.291 --> 01:32.926
All right, well, you seem to
have everything under control.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.094
You need anything from me?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.128
A raise.

01:35.128 --> 01:37.564
Get in line.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.670
You want some breakfast?

01:43.670 --> 01:46.340
Kale and protein powder?
I think I'll pass.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.774
If you show me what's under
that robe, I'll make you

01:47.774 --> 01:49.443
whatever you want.
Well, in that case,

01:49.443 --> 01:52.479
you're gonna have to produce
some pretty killer pancakes.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.047
Mm-hmm.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.051
Wish I didn't have court.

01:58.051 --> 02:01.388
Mm. It's better than being stuck
in Jersey traffic.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.256
No, I mean, I wish
I could come with you.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.925
It's no biggie.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.727
Telling your mom that
we're engaged is a biggie.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.328
Mm...
Plus, I haven't
even met her yet.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.797
Exactly. Let's keep it that way.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.865
What does that mean?

02:11.865 --> 02:15.302
My mother has scared off

02:15.302 --> 02:17.904
every boyfriend
I've ever introduced her to.

02:17.904 --> 02:19.940
I'm not every boyfriend.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.809
Well, then you'll see
for yourself when you meet her.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.144
At the wedding.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.314
Ridiculous.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.386
Eddie, great news. My court date
got pushed to tomorrow.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.920
Oh.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.156
I can come with you.
Wait, what?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.191
Yeah, I'll just take the
day and come with you.

02:38.191 --> 02:40.327
No, definitely not.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.600
Invisibility.
Definitely invisibility.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.769
No, man. Spidey-sense.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.204
Then, you get fair warning
when something's gonna go down.

02:51.204 --> 02:53.507
How about X

02:53.507 --> 02:56.243
Ugh, no. There are things
I don't want to see.

02:56.243 --> 02:59.312
I've always had a thing
for the Lasso of Truth.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.315
Come in handy when
we make detective.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.726
Hey, why do you guys
always weigh the brain?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.261
To see how much they weigh.

03:14.261 --> 03:17.097
Actually, it's to look
for abnormalities.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.565
This one is

03:18.565 --> 03:20.033
three pounds
of memories, emotions

03:20.033 --> 03:22.636
and 86 billion nerve cells.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.639
Hmm.
I've always wondered about the
part that controls your emotion.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.207
Oh, the amygdala.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209
Kind of wish I could have it
removed sometimes.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.610
Yeah, but then you'd
be a serial killer.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.778
Uh, what can you
tell us about

03:31.778 --> 03:33.146
the head you found
at the garbage dump?

03:33.146 --> 03:36.349
I'm waiting on DNA, but the time
of death and the injuries

03:36.349 --> 03:38.351
are consistent
with that headless corpse

03:38.351 --> 03:39.986
you guys brought me
a few weeks ago.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.255
You mean the one belonging
to Luis Delgado?

03:42.255 --> 03:44.491
That body wasn't Luis Delgado.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.892
What are you talking about?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.762
That body and the head that
you pulled out from the garbage

03:48.762 --> 03:50.831
this morning appear
to belong to the same person.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.499
No, the body
we found on the beach

03:52.499 --> 03:55.569
with Luis Delgado's clothes on
and Luis Delgado's tattoos

03:55.569 --> 03:57.137
belong to Luis Delgado.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.472
Trust me.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.274
I had to get dental records
from Mexico to confirm.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.610
Great. Then the son of a bitch

04:03.610 --> 04:06.146
who burned down my house
is still alive.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.427
What is it?

04:20.427 --> 04:23.830
Two officers sitting
on a witness's house

04:23.830 --> 04:26.600
were shot multiple times
inside their patrol car.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.901
Both critical.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.537
Anyone likely?
Information's
still coming in.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.639
They're at Saint Irene's.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.007
And the shooter?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.142
No word yet.

04:35.142 --> 04:38.145
Frank, one of the officers

04:38.145 --> 04:40.881
is Abigail's husband.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.905
â™ª â™ª

05:22.489 --> 05:24.057
Hey.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.725
Two cops were shot
in their patrol car.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.561
I heard. Any word
on their condition?

05:27.561 --> 05:29.596
Still waiting. But Erin,

05:29.596 --> 05:31.932
they just picked up
the shooter.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.867
It's Jose Cortez.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.504
The guy we released
this morning?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.539
He went straight from
arraignment court

05:39.539 --> 05:42.108
to his apartment,
he picked up a .45

05:42.108 --> 05:45.312
and he opened fire. He's got
a record for murder and assault.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.781
No. His rap sheet came up empty.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.216
It came up empty
in our system

05:49.216 --> 05:51.851
because his priors
were in Mexico.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.688
Anthony, this is my fault.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.022
No.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.491
Your A.D.A. followed
the bail recommendations

05:58.491 --> 05:59.492
to the letter.

05:59.492 --> 06:00.727
Tell that to the two cops

06:00.727 --> 06:02.262
laying in the hospital.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.336
Officer Davis is out of surgery.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.472
He's in recovery.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.807
Brian took a bullet to his neck,

06:47.807 --> 06:49.709
which severed his jugular.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.716
Did I ever show you
Brian's department photo?

07:04.557 --> 07:07.627
You're not supposed to,
but... he smiled.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.963
On purpose.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.365
He said every time
you see a cop shot

07:12.365 --> 07:14.100
on the front page of the paper,

07:14.100 --> 07:17.637
it's always the official photo
and they look so serious.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.106
He figured if he smiled,
it was...

07:20.106 --> 07:23.543
some sort of guarantee that
nothing bad would happen to him.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.250
He might be right.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.554
I've promised him all kinds
of things if he gets better.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.009
Brian,

07:56.009 --> 07:59.346
it's Commissioner Reagan.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.602
Whatever it takes, Abigail.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.075
DANNY:
I'm telling you,

08:29.075 --> 08:31.277
Delgado had this guy
made up to look like him,

08:31.277 --> 08:32.812
even down to the tattoo,

08:32.812 --> 08:34.481
so he could pull
one over on us.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.684
Mano Sangriento is all over
Long Island and Manhattan now.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.753
They all use
the black hand.
He played us.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.956
I've checked every ship
and airline passenger list.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.124
I don't think he left town.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.458
Look, it's been weeks, okay?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.460
He could be anywhere by
now, including Mexico.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.195
Just speak to the DEA.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.864
See if they'll give you
anything they got on him.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.999
I'll check the warrant my sister
gave me on his cell phone

08:52.999 --> 08:55.201
and see if that
turns anything up.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.678
I think someone else
should find Delgado.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.280
It's way too personal

09:07.280 --> 09:09.315
between you and him.
I'm not gonna go

09:09.315 --> 09:11.151
off the rails, if that's
what you're thinking, okay?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.152
I promise.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.253
You already did.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.221
Do you really want to put us
in the crosshairs?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.556
Look, I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch,

09:16.556 --> 09:17.924
no matter what it takes.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.695
You don't want
to be a part of that,

09:22.695 --> 09:25.165
then I suggest
you walk away on this one.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.333
You really want me to walk away?

09:46.519 --> 09:48.588
JANKO:
Mom.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.989
Hi.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.392
Hi.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.227
Hmm.
This is Jamie.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.064
Hi.
You didn't tell me
you were bringing someone.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.133
I know. I'm sorry.
Jamie Reagan.
Nice to meet you.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.301
How do you do?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.235
Very well.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.338
You're welcome.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.673
Um...
Can I steal this?

10:06.673 --> 10:07.941
Yes, no problem.

10:12.912 --> 10:15.782
So...

10:15.782 --> 10:17.117
are you dating?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.686
Is this, like,
a new boyfriend?

10:19.686 --> 10:21.921
Uh, he-he's my fiancÃ©.

10:21.921 --> 10:25.024
FiancÃ©?

10:25.024 --> 10:27.093
And this is the first time
I'm meeting you?

10:27.093 --> 10:28.962
Well, we didn't
really date date.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.096
You didn't date?

10:30.096 --> 10:31.231
What he means
is we've known each other

10:31.231 --> 10:32.565
for a long time.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.267
We were partners on the job.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.103
So you're a cop.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.104
He's a sergeant.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.243
He went to Harvard.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.546
A quarter of a million dollars
in tuition

10:46.546 --> 10:48.581
and you decided to be a cop.

10:48.581 --> 10:49.749
Well, my whole family's
in law enforcement,

10:49.749 --> 10:51.518
so I guess it was in the blood.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.620
It's too bad doctor or lawyer
wasn't in the blood.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.954
Then you two could

10:54.954 --> 10:57.824
actually afford
a nice lifestyle.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.492
We love our lifestyle, Mom.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.693
Do you own a house?

11:00.693 --> 11:02.328
I have an apartment.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.563
Eddie likes being in the city.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.032
"Eddie"?
No one calls me
Edit, Mom.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.735
I do. Your father does.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.070
Well, I like Eddie.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.606
So, you use a boy's name
and he uses a girl's name.

11:13.606 --> 11:14.507
Mom.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.709
:
I'm just saying.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.745
That's okay.
My real name's Jameson.

11:18.745 --> 11:19.979
Like the whiskey.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.881
Yeah, like the whiskey.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.350
It's a good thing your parents
didn't like to drink Smirnoff.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.886
Mom.
What?

11:29.255 --> 11:32.592
So, Reagan, is that, is that
any relation to...

11:32.592 --> 11:34.227
The police commissioner,
yes, he's my dad.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.497
What?

11:37.497 --> 11:39.599
You must see the humor
in this, Edit.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.234
Your father's in jail,

11:41.234 --> 11:44.270
and you're marrying
the police commissioner's son.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.875
That's going to make for some
very interesting conversation

11:48.875 --> 11:50.910
at the wedding reception,
don't you think?

11:57.550 --> 12:01.287
Looks like Davis has permanent
nerve damage to his hand.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.224
GORMLEY:
His shooting hand,

12:04.224 --> 12:07.427
so he'll be off
the street for good.
Well, not necessarily.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.530
Not with the kind of things
they can do today.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.532
And Brian Baker?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.435
Still the same.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.437
A.D.A. Reagan, boss.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.043
GORMLEY:
Erin.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.411
Garrett. Sid.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.213
Erin.
How's Brian?

12:27.213 --> 12:29.215
Still unconscious.

12:29.215 --> 12:32.018
It's a waiting game right now.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.420
And Abigail?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.056
Abigail hasn't left his side.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.929
Where's your boss?

12:44.163 --> 12:47.166
He's not coming.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.438
Okay.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.008
I'll be in my office, boss.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.418
Cortez was my case.
I supervised it.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.320
It was my responsibility.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.390
What were you thinking
letting him walk?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.525
He didn't walk.
He made bail.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.261
Bail was set at 500 bucks, Erin.
Of course he walked.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.497
That's chump change
for a drug dealer.

13:17.497 --> 13:21.167
The arrest was
for a nonviolent drug charge.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.869
We are not in the business
of asking

13:22.869 --> 13:25.772
for high bail because we think
someone might become dangerous.

13:25.772 --> 13:29.942
He has a felony record
in Mexico: murder, assault.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.912
My office didn't have access
to that information.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.282
So the D.A.'s office

13:36.282 --> 13:38.351
is in a rush to hold his hand,

13:38.351 --> 13:41.521
and he goes out
and shoots two of my cops.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.824
What do you want me to say, Dad?

13:44.824 --> 13:48.394
The department policy is to ask
for little or no bail

13:48.394 --> 13:50.496
for nonviolent crimes.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.132
The policy has had success.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.002
Not so much.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.141
â™ª â™ª

14:19.192 --> 14:21.527
Where is he?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.930
I don't know who
you're talking about.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.231
The guy you're
standing next to

14:25.231 --> 14:27.900
in the painting over
there. Where is he?

14:32.271 --> 14:33.272
Uh-uh.
No...

14:33.272 --> 14:35.508
Don't even think about it.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.776
You're trespassing.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.244
You broke into my house.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.980
You mean like
your husband trespassed

14:40.980 --> 14:43.182
when he burned my house down?

14:43.182 --> 14:44.784
Mom?

14:45.785 --> 14:46.886
Is everything okay?

14:49.021 --> 14:50.723
Go back inside.

14:53.159 --> 14:54.827
Where's your phone?
In the kitchen.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.262
Let's go get it.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.300
Your husband's making a lot
of money terrorizing people.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.002
Who's terrorizing who?

15:03.002 --> 15:04.504
Get the phone.
Pick it up.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.506
Call your husband.
Come on.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.374
Turn around.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.777
Don't do anything crazy.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.215
Luis?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.185
Hey, remember me?

15:19.185 --> 15:21.120
Where's Isabel?
She's right here.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.855
Kids are here, too.
But don't worry, they're safe.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.991
Unless, of course,
I decide to burn your house down

15:24.991 --> 15:26.359
like you burned down mine.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.660
If you harm them,

15:27.660 --> 15:30.797
I swear I'll kill you.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.499
Well, then you better
hurry up and get home.

15:33.499 --> 15:34.634
Sit down.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.212
Officer Davis took a bullet
to his right hand,

15:46.212 --> 15:48.414
which has caused
permanent nerve damage.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.983
Officer Baker was hit
with a bullet in his neck,

15:50.983 --> 15:53.052
which punctured his jugular.

15:53.052 --> 15:57.790
The bullet was removed, but he
has not regained consciousness.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.126
We will have updates
as things progress.

16:01.527 --> 16:02.829
What about the shooter?

16:02.829 --> 16:04.397
Uh, the shooter,
Jose Cortez,

16:04.397 --> 16:06.666
was apprehended
shortly after the shooting.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.167
He has been charged

16:08.167 --> 16:09.902
with attempted murder
in the first degree

16:09.902 --> 16:12.104
and will be arraigned
later this afternoon.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.407
Initial reports said Cortez
had been arrested before,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.142
but released on bail.
That's correct.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.411
He was arrested for
drug possession

16:18.411 --> 16:20.079
and released on bail
this morning.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.148
MAN:
Why was he released on bail?

16:22.148 --> 16:23.583
The nonviolent nature
of his crimes

16:23.583 --> 16:25.651
and the lack
of prior criminal history.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.221
Why was he released
in the first place?
He was a member of Mano Sangriento.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.456
Mr. Cortez had
no criminal history

16:30.456 --> 16:32.692
or gang affiliation
on record.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.360
It was handled

16:34.360 --> 16:35.394
as a first-time offense.

16:35.394 --> 16:36.963
What do you mean, "on record"?

16:36.963 --> 16:39.632
Mr. Cortez had
a prior record in Mexico

16:39.632 --> 16:43.436
that did not come up
on the initial background check.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.438
In light of what happened,
is the D.A.'s office

16:45.438 --> 16:46.806
going to rethink this policy?

16:46.806 --> 16:50.977
The policy was established
to decrease overcrowded prisons

16:50.977 --> 16:52.645
filled with
nonviolent offenders.

16:52.645 --> 16:56.249
In this regard,
the policy is a success.

16:56.249 --> 16:59.518
The NYPD has two good officers
in the hospital,

16:59.518 --> 17:01.721
one facing disability,

17:01.721 --> 17:03.956
one may not survive.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.459
Asking for minimum bail

17:06.459 --> 17:08.728
for felonies
puts my officers

17:08.728 --> 17:10.529
and, more importantly,

17:10.529 --> 17:12.131
our citizens at risk,

17:12.131 --> 17:15.268
because these criminals
will then be incentivized

17:15.268 --> 17:17.570
to go out and commit more,

17:17.570 --> 17:19.272
worse crimes.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.340
And that is exactly
what happened today.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.044
GARRETT:
That's all.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.312
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.587
I don't know how you
actually thought

17:34.587 --> 17:35.855
you could avoid me
meeting your mother.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.190
Oh, I was doing a great job
avoiding until today.

17:38.190 --> 17:40.026
Eddie, you've met my whole
family; they're not perfect.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.828
You have... you know, you have
a Norman Rockwell family.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.997
You go to church on Sundays,
and you eat together on Sundays.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.766
Just please don't.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.834
Just saying, it doesn't
bother me what she says.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.504
She just has no filter.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.805
And she only cares

17:52.805 --> 17:54.340
about money.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.475
Eddie, do you know why we have
family dinner every Sunday?

17:56.475 --> 17:57.910
No. Why?

17:57.910 --> 18:00.947
Because my grandmother grew up
poor in a small town in Ireland.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.581
She was the oldest of 12 kids,

18:02.581 --> 18:04.317
and there was never
enough to eat.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.319
She moved to New York
to make money.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.487
She met my grandpa, and
when they got married,

18:08.487 --> 18:10.089
she promised herself
that they would always

18:10.089 --> 18:11.891
have more than enough to eat.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.392
Family dinner was

18:13.392 --> 18:16.195
just her way of proudly
proving that every week.

18:17.863 --> 18:22.768
That meal was so important to
her because of how she grew up.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.137
I'm just saying, there must be
some deep-seated reason

18:25.137 --> 18:27.239
why your mother is
so obsessed about money.

18:27.239 --> 18:31.043
My mother chooses to insult me

18:31.043 --> 18:34.480
and to insult every person
I've ever brought home.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.517
â™ª â™ª

18:51.030 --> 18:53.065
Yeah.
Leave the car there

18:53.065 --> 18:54.533
and walk to the garage.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.614
Welcome home.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.982
Come on in.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.885
Right over there.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.424
Keep your hands where

19:18.424 --> 19:20.726
I can see 'em.
Where's my wife and my boys?

19:20.726 --> 19:23.863
Why'd you set my house on fire?

19:23.863 --> 19:25.297
You're really pretending
to be an innocent victim?

19:25.297 --> 19:27.800
:
Who gave you the order?
Doesn't matter.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.735
You think if you
take him down, it's over?

19:29.735 --> 19:31.437
You guys thought
you got El Chapo.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.673
There's 20 guys lining up
to be the next El Chapo.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.541
That's how
these organizations work.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.377
How this works is that I'm
gonna find every son of a bitch

19:38.377 --> 19:40.680
who had a hand in setting
my house on fire,

19:40.680 --> 19:42.915
and I'm not gonna stop until
every one of them's behind bars,

19:42.915 --> 19:44.316
or worse.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.985
That's how it works.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.653
Won't bring your wife back.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.190
You have two sons.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.260
You really want
to put them in danger?

19:57.329 --> 19:58.964
Baez, I got Delgado.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.066
Request a 10-85

20:00.066 --> 20:03.302
to 12 Bayview Avenue.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.603
You're under arrest.
Turn around.

20:04.603 --> 20:06.939
Put your hands
behind your back.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.045
You made a big mistake.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.147
You're the one making
a mistake, bro.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.749
I'm one of you.
Yeah?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.250
How's that?

20:19.351 --> 20:21.020
I'm working for the DEA.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.736
We have you

20:37.736 --> 20:39.505
for the murder
of Melissa Sanchez.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.373
No, you don't.
DANNY:
Yes, we do.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.709
You told me you killed her
and her unborn baby.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.711
I told you
I didn't think she was okay.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.746
As it turns out, I was right.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.416
She wasn't okay. She was dead.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.886
And Manny Sanchez.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.723
Reagan, what do you think
you're doing?

20:57.723 --> 20:59.391
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

20:59.391 --> 21:00.826
Can I talk to you outside?

21:08.300 --> 21:09.535
What the hell are you doing
here? And more importantly,

21:09.535 --> 21:10.603
what the hell
are you doing working

21:10.603 --> 21:12.338
with a scumbag like Delgado?

21:12.338 --> 21:13.873
We made a deal with him.
Yeah, I know you did.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.674
You made a deal
with a cold-blooded killer

21:15.674 --> 21:18.043
who murdered an innocent woman
and her unborn baby.

21:18.043 --> 21:21.247
Delgado's a hired hand.
We're after JosÃ© Rojas.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.516
His boss. La Almeja. The Clam.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.851
Okay.
Delgado is a hired gun.

21:25.851 --> 21:30.156
Rojas has murdered or ordered
the murder of hundreds.

21:30.156 --> 21:33.125
Okay? We get Rojas,
we bring down the organization.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.460
Great, then go get him.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.328
I already got Delgado.
He's mine.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.464
No, you're gonna back off.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.798
Go to hell.

21:39.798 --> 21:43.035
Look, I get that this
has gotten personal for you.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.503
Don't go there.
Okay, but we don't need you

21:44.503 --> 21:47.907
going in there, being a hothead,
blowing our case.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.242
I arrested Delgado.
It's my collar.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.511
Are you kidding me right now?
I got him on murder
charges. Okay?

21:52.511 --> 21:55.147
That trumps any drug charge
you could possibly get.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.082
So unless you want
to go before a judge

21:57.082 --> 21:58.918
and try to get him
to give you a writ for me

21:58.918 --> 22:00.753
to turn him over to the feds,
so be it. You go do that.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.022
But until such time,
Delgado's mine.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.356
He stays here with me.

22:04.356 --> 22:06.292
Hey.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.428
What?

22:09.428 --> 22:11.230
Maybe we can work together
on this.

22:12.364 --> 22:13.599
Well, it's the only way

22:13.599 --> 22:15.701
we're both gonna get
what we want.

22:21.607 --> 22:22.841
ALL: Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts,

22:22.841 --> 22:24.977
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

22:24.977 --> 22:27.980
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

22:38.791 --> 22:42.428
You mind, uh, passing
me the mac and cheese?
Sure.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.430
Here you go.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.531
Looks good.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.701
And what's the matter
with Daniel?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.836
Nothing.

22:50.836 --> 22:52.538
Well, you're not piling food
onto your plate,

22:52.538 --> 22:54.106
so it must be something.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.708
Well, I kind of lost my appetite

22:55.708 --> 22:57.710
when I learned that the guy
who burned our house down

22:57.710 --> 22:59.712
cut a deal with the DEA.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.513
You know who burned
our house down?

23:01.513 --> 23:04.149
DANNY: Yeah.
We'll talk about it later.

23:04.149 --> 23:07.519
In the meantime, that guy's
walking around free as a bird.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.655
Well, you could always
blame the D.A.'s office.

23:09.655 --> 23:12.725
It seems to be the common
dumping ground around here.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.927
HENRY:
No one's dumping

23:14.927 --> 23:16.395
on the D.A.'s office.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.730
NICKY:
You saw

23:17.730 --> 23:19.098
the joint press conference.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.166
System's broken.
Somebody had to call it out.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.668
And here I thought
a press conference

23:22.668 --> 23:24.203
was for dispensing information,

23:24.203 --> 23:26.705
not calling people out.
My mistake.

23:26.705 --> 23:29.108
DANNY: Well, last I heard,
you commit a crime,

23:29.108 --> 23:31.443
you suffer the consequences,
end of story.

23:31.443 --> 23:33.812
You know how many times
you and Jamie have come to me

23:33.812 --> 23:35.648
for a search warrant
or a subpoena,

23:35.648 --> 23:37.616
and you haven't had everything
to get it?

23:37.616 --> 23:38.851
Yeah, about as many times

23:38.851 --> 23:40.286
as you've said no.

23:40.286 --> 23:42.021
SEAN: I'm sorry,
I still don't understand.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.789
If you know who burned
our house down,

23:43.789 --> 23:45.524
then why is he
still walking?

23:45.524 --> 23:48.027
It's something called
judicial perversion.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.295
JAMIE:
Judicial diversion.

23:49.295 --> 23:50.796
It's a policy

23:50.796 --> 23:53.799
where nonviolent offenders
get reduced bail

23:53.799 --> 23:57.069
and rehab, community service
instead of jail time.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.838
It's called
mollycoddling criminals.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.140
Exactly.
NICKY:
Is there anything

24:01.140 --> 24:03.142
that you guys don't blame
on the attorneys?

24:03.142 --> 24:04.543
Well, I'm afraid at the moment,

24:04.543 --> 24:06.412
there happens
to be plenty to blame.

24:06.412 --> 24:07.446
Amen to that.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.881
HENRY:
That's what you get for having

24:08.881 --> 24:11.450
a liberal D.A.
and a liberal mayor.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.152
Like cops don't
make mistakes?

24:13.152 --> 24:15.487
Nobody's saying that.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.022
JAMIE: To be fair, I understand
why he got a reduced bail.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.458
His arrest wasn't
for a large felony weight.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.827
Well, how about his affiliation
with an illegal gang?

24:21.827 --> 24:24.229
Or his criminal record
in Mexico?

24:24.229 --> 24:25.631
His criminal record
in Mexico

24:25.631 --> 24:27.733
doesn't come up in
a background check.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.168
It would if you ran him
through Interpol.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.203
ERIN: Why would I run
a low-level drug dealer

24:31.203 --> 24:32.237
through Interpol?

24:32.237 --> 24:33.272
Why wouldn't you?

24:37.543 --> 24:40.112
You know, when I first started
coming to these family dinners

24:40.112 --> 24:43.449
and you guys would argue,
I would get really nervous

24:43.449 --> 24:46.819
'cause I thought maybe you'd
never talk to each other again.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.654
But...

24:48.654 --> 24:50.255
you do.

24:50.255 --> 24:53.158
You just keep talking.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.928
Come hell or high water.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.463
You saying we talk too much?

24:57.463 --> 24:59.999
No.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.667
Well, don't worry, Eddie.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.670
No matter what you do,
you're golden at this table.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.605
I am?

25:06.605 --> 25:09.375
As long as you wear NYPD blue.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.764
I didn't know
you were coming here.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.265
Edit never called me.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.401
I didn't tell her.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.569
May I come in?

25:42.808 --> 25:45.043
I bet she's mad at me.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.278
Well, why wouldn't she be?

25:46.278 --> 25:47.913
She came to give you
some good news,

25:47.913 --> 25:49.214
and you rained on her parade.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.884
The good news would've been
she's marrying someone

25:51.884 --> 25:54.753
who could afford to give her
the life that she's used to.

25:54.753 --> 25:56.088
And what life would that be?

25:56.088 --> 25:58.724
One where your husband's
in prison for fraud

25:58.724 --> 26:00.592
and she wants to cut you
out of her life?

26:00.592 --> 26:02.428
She should be grateful.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.196
We gave her everything.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.799
Your husband cheated people
out of their savings.

26:06.799 --> 26:09.835
You insulted every guy
she ever brought around.

26:09.835 --> 26:11.570
I tell the truth.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.172
And the truth about me
is I don't make

26:13.172 --> 26:15.140
enough money? I'm
the wrong religion?

26:15.140 --> 26:16.241
I live in the wrong borough?

26:16.241 --> 26:17.443
I won't apologize

26:17.443 --> 26:19.077
for wanting what's best
for my daughter.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.647
I'm what's best
for your daughter.
Oh, because you love her?

26:21.647 --> 26:24.316
And that's gonna
take care of the bills?

26:24.316 --> 26:27.453
I live a comfortable life,
and my family will, too.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.822
Will it meet your standards?
I don't know.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.257
But my family
will always come first.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.760
That sounds great
on a Hallmark card.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.695
But in reality?

26:38.564 --> 26:40.466
Not so much.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.304
I don't want Edit to end up...

26:45.304 --> 26:46.572
Like you did?

26:48.607 --> 26:49.608
Maybe you need to see the world

26:49.608 --> 26:51.043
through a different set
of glasses.

26:51.043 --> 26:54.980
Well, I certainly don't trust
the rose-colored ones you wear.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.216
You haven't tried them on yet.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.461
I'm in the middle
of pretrial hearings, Pop.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.432
You call me
out here for this.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.034
I made you your
favorite sandwich.

27:16.034 --> 27:19.104
Thank you. Now,
what are we doing out here?

27:19.104 --> 27:20.439
Getting you out
of the office.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.108
My office is not
the problem. Dad is.

27:23.108 --> 27:25.577
Oh, is he, now

27:25.577 --> 27:27.379
'Cause he says
what he feels?

27:27.379 --> 27:29.781
In front of
millions of viewers

27:29.781 --> 27:32.017
at my first press conference
as bureau chief?

27:32.017 --> 27:33.585
Yeah, he could've
tempered it down.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.387
You mean watered it down?

27:35.387 --> 27:37.022
Whatever you want
to call it.

27:37.022 --> 27:38.557
You're upset because

27:38.557 --> 27:40.826
he talked like the
police commissioner

27:40.826 --> 27:42.261
and not your father.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.264
I don't see how he could've
handled it any other way.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.065
Of course you're gonna
take his side.

27:47.065 --> 27:48.734
I'm not taking sides.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.703
Why are you taking this
so personally?

27:53.805 --> 27:56.808
I can take the slings and arrows
from other attorneys

27:56.808 --> 27:58.810
and the D.A.
and even the press, but...

27:58.810 --> 28:00.312
But not your father?

28:00.312 --> 28:02.147
He was criticizing

28:02.147 --> 28:04.983
the D.A.'s office, not you.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.151
That's not what it felt like,

28:06.151 --> 28:08.654
and I was the one up there
taking the heat.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.956
You're confusing work
and family.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.358
Your father

28:13.358 --> 28:16.495
has the right to disagree
with the D.A.--

28:16.495 --> 28:18.263
yes, in public,

28:18.263 --> 28:21.800
and yes, even with you
standing there next to him--

28:21.800 --> 28:25.103
because it's his job.

28:25.103 --> 28:28.173
But no matter what happens,

28:28.173 --> 28:31.443
you'll always have his love
and support.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.518
Every time you leave the house,
you have to call first

28:39.518 --> 28:40.852
to say where you're going.

28:40.852 --> 28:42.187
If you're gonna be late
getting back

28:42.187 --> 28:43.388
or your train is delayed,

28:43.388 --> 28:44.990
your car breaks down,
you need to call us

28:44.990 --> 28:46.425
with the details.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.994
Then I should tell you
the coke and fentanyl exchange

28:48.994 --> 28:50.329
may be going down tonight.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.164
"May be going down tonight"?
I'll get a call

28:52.164 --> 28:53.765
this afternoon to confirm.

28:53.765 --> 28:54.866
Where?

28:54.866 --> 28:56.068
The old candy factory.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.936
I don't know how many people.

28:57.936 --> 29:00.672
Usually six or seven total.
Members of the Double Treys,

29:00.672 --> 29:03.008
Mano Sangriento, me.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.476
DANNY: Good. Now we know
where it's going down.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.612
So we don't need him to do this.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.981
Rojas expects me to be
there to handle the money.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.950
If he finds out I'm not,
he'll be in the wind.

29:11.950 --> 29:12.918
Don't trust him.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.623
Wipe that smile off your face.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.591
That's hard to do 'cause
you're so damn entertaining.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.094
Danny. Danny.
Reagan! Reagan!

29:23.261 --> 29:24.429
MOLINA:
Outside.

29:26.131 --> 29:28.467
Now!

29:28.467 --> 29:30.469
This is too personal for you

29:30.469 --> 29:32.904
and you cannot handle this...
It's not personal.

29:32.904 --> 29:34.940
I don't trust the son
of a bitch, okay?

29:34.940 --> 29:36.875
Well, we're on it.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.144
You don't know how
that guy works.
No?

29:39.144 --> 29:41.880
35 years ago,
my father crossed the border

29:41.880 --> 29:44.116
to get away
from Mano Sangriento.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.351
Okay, when he finally had
enough money,

29:46.351 --> 29:49.287
he went back to get the rest
of his family.

29:49.287 --> 29:53.158
Sangriento had killed
every last one of them.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.460
So...

29:55.460 --> 29:57.229
don't tell me I don't know him.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.264
Look, I'm sorry.

29:59.264 --> 30:01.199
I am.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.503
But you're playing with fire,
trusting this guy.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.004
You're the one playing
with fire,

30:06.004 --> 30:08.006
letting him get to you
like that.

30:08.006 --> 30:09.341
You either play by my rules,

30:09.341 --> 30:11.276
or you get the hell off my team.

30:32.197 --> 30:35.600
Okay. We got Delgado.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.171
Amigo.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.764
I know where you live.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.399
On my signal, we're gonna go.

31:09.334 --> 31:09.935
One.

31:11.903 --> 31:12.571
Two.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.474
Wait a minute.
Where the hell is he going?

31:15.474 --> 31:17.008
I don't know. His
car's in the front.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.444
What the hell is he doing?

31:19.444 --> 31:20.579
Three.
No. Wait.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.814
No, wait! No!
Go, go, go.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.784
Move, move!

31:25.784 --> 31:28.887
Hey. It's a setup. Hold on!

31:30.355 --> 31:31.289
Hey!

31:40.465 --> 31:43.401
Help! Help me! Help me!

31:43.401 --> 31:47.205
Come here, come here.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.274
Hang on!

31:52.244 --> 31:54.146
Baez, it's pepper spray!

32:00.619 --> 32:03.155
MAN:
It's pepper spray!

32:17.269 --> 32:19.171
Delgado?!

32:29.581 --> 32:31.516
Delgado?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.901
Aah!

33:17.128 --> 33:19.197
It's a didgeridoo.

33:19.197 --> 33:22.100
An Australian wind instrument,
a little bit like a trumpet.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.102
Oh.

33:24.102 --> 33:26.538
Thank you.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.541
It's a gift from
the prime minister of Australia

33:29.541 --> 33:31.076
for hosting him last week.

33:31.076 --> 33:35.480
A donation to the NYPD Museum?

33:36.748 --> 33:39.417
Brian's doing better.

33:39.417 --> 33:42.187
He is, thank you.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.389
Thought you weren't coming in
for a few weeks.

33:44.389 --> 33:47.092
I told Jimmy
I'd relieve him for a few hours.

33:47.092 --> 33:48.426
I could use the break.

33:48.426 --> 33:51.663
Things are bad
if work's a break.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.999
Actually, things are very good.

33:53.999 --> 33:56.201
Brian is breathing on his own,

33:56.201 --> 33:58.336
he's complaining
about hospital food,

33:58.336 --> 34:01.239
and they're gonna release him
tomorrow.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.342
Good news.

34:04.342 --> 34:06.144
Well, maybe you should

34:06.144 --> 34:08.246
rethink that no-smile policy.

34:13.952 --> 34:17.756
I have accompanied you
on many, many hospital visits

34:17.756 --> 34:21.459
to officers who have been
injured in the line of duty,

34:21.459 --> 34:24.663
some who have died
in the line of duty.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.232
I knew it was your job.

34:27.232 --> 34:31.336
What I never fully understood
was just how important

34:31.336 --> 34:34.306
your visit is
to the officer's family.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.180
And now I know.

34:43.548 --> 34:45.550
Thank you.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.966
Son of a bitch, he set us up.
I told you not to trust him.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.233
We don't know that yet.

35:02.233 --> 35:03.635
Of course he set us up.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.037
He got the hell out of there
right before the boxes exploded.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.506
How the hell would he know?!
He knew what was coming.

35:08.506 --> 35:11.376
Then why did he go back
to his apartment?
What?

35:12.510 --> 35:13.845
Look at the ankle monitor.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.480
It proves that he's there.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.148
Then, what happened?

35:17.148 --> 35:19.284
Well, I'll let you
know after I see him.
No, no, no, no.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.919
You'll let 'em know
after we see him.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.187
We're going with you.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.127
Let's go.

35:37.769 --> 35:40.305
Delgado? Police!

35:40.305 --> 35:42.540
I thought the GPS said
he was here.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.042
It did.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.277
It's Agent Molina, Luis.

35:46.277 --> 35:47.712
We need to talk to you.

35:47.712 --> 35:48.847
Luis?

35:48.847 --> 35:50.115
DELGADO:
Please, come in.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.860
You know, I'm glad you came.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.228
Something I've been wanting
to tell you.

36:03.228 --> 36:06.898
What's that?
You know your wife's
helicopter accident?

36:06.898 --> 36:08.233
It really wasn't an accident.

36:08.233 --> 36:10.101
It was all arranged
by Mano Sangriento,

36:10.101 --> 36:12.771
because you started
playing games with them.

36:18.043 --> 36:19.411
You son of a bitch.
Where the hell are you?

36:19.411 --> 36:20.712
Where are you?!

36:20.712 --> 36:22.547
DELGADO:
You really shouldn't
play games with them.

36:22.547 --> 36:23.581
And do you know why?

36:23.581 --> 36:25.116
I don't give a damn why.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.452
DELGADO:
Because they always win.

36:28.753 --> 36:30.755
Where are you, Delgado?

36:36.928 --> 36:39.497
Real tough guy, huh?

36:39.497 --> 36:40.732
Couldn't come face me?

36:40.732 --> 36:42.600
Oh, I am facing you, Detective.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.970
And you know what I see?
A loser.

36:45.970 --> 36:49.407
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go mix myself a drink.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.578
I'll get TARU in here,
run a trace on the video.

36:53.578 --> 36:54.913
You told me
the GPS said he was here.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.815
The son of a bitch isn't here!

36:56.815 --> 36:59.084
It said that he was here.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.667
LENA:
Good one.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.136
Hello?

37:18.136 --> 37:19.537
Hey.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.239
Eddie, uh, Mom and I--

37:21.239 --> 37:22.574
we made dinner for you.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.576
My mom doesn't cook.
What did I

37:24.576 --> 37:25.910
always tell you, Edit?

37:25.910 --> 37:27.512
"Forget the dishes on the shelf,

37:27.512 --> 37:28.847
be a tasty dish yourself"?

37:30.081 --> 37:33.551
So, we ordered takeout
from Balthazar's.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.087
Want some wine?

37:36.087 --> 37:37.388
Mm-hmm.

37:37.388 --> 37:38.656
Okay.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.929
She ordered from the most
expensive restaurant,

37:44.929 --> 37:46.765
and we are gonna
foot the bill.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.000
Yeah, I know.
You know?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.468
What were you thinking?

37:50.468 --> 37:52.537
I thought it would be good
to make amends.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.172
She brought the
family photo album?

37:54.172 --> 37:55.707
Well, that was my idea.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.542
Does it get better
if she has a few drinks?

37:57.542 --> 37:59.844
Well, it gets better if we do.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.382
Edit, your first bikini!

38:04.382 --> 38:06.351
It's a good thing
you grew some boobs after that.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.621
Who was that guy
that you went with?

38:09.621 --> 38:10.955
What was his name?

38:10.955 --> 38:12.423
Oh. Stan.

38:12.423 --> 38:13.958
Stan. That's right.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.861
His father was a cardiologist.

38:16.861 --> 38:18.530
What ever happened to him?
Well,

38:18.530 --> 38:21.499
Mom, uh, Stan became
a cardiologist, too,

38:21.499 --> 38:23.568
and he lives in Boca.

38:23.568 --> 38:25.003
Ah.
Oh. Nice boy.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.705
I'll have a refill.
Yeah.

38:27.705 --> 38:31.176
Mom, you scared off every boy
I ever brought home.

38:31.176 --> 38:35.380
If they were all scared off,
then none of them deserve you.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.415
Is that your excuse?

38:37.415 --> 38:38.783
It's true.

38:38.783 --> 38:41.386
They all ran, except for one.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.926
He's the only one who came back.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.010
I love you.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.645
Something wrong?

39:07.645 --> 39:09.681
No.

39:11.616 --> 39:14.252
LENA:
You've got

39:14.252 --> 39:15.386
to see this, Jamie.

39:15.386 --> 39:17.822
Eddie dressed as
Jessica Rabbit

39:17.822 --> 39:19.724
for Halloween.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.726
Ooh, I actually look
pretty hot in that one.

39:21.726 --> 39:23.661
Well, what are we waiting for?
Mm.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.449
You already put the bait on?

39:44.449 --> 39:46.985
Thought I'd save
you the trouble.
It's a blood worm?

39:46.985 --> 39:48.886
Sand worms.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.389
I would have gone
with herring.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.758
You want me to put
on a bottom bait?

39:53.758 --> 39:56.928
No, I didn't ask you to come
out here to valet the tackle.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.863
Okay.

40:01.032 --> 40:04.068
You know how old you were
when I taught you to fish?

40:04.068 --> 40:06.004
No.
Seven.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.539
Actually, I wasn't
gonna teach you at all,

40:08.539 --> 40:10.675
even though I
taught the boys.

40:10.675 --> 40:13.645
Because I was a girl?

40:13.645 --> 40:15.880
No.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.249
Because it is
the kind of activity

40:18.249 --> 40:20.985
where even
if you do everything perfectly,

40:20.985 --> 40:23.821
there's no guarantee of a fish.

40:23.821 --> 40:27.859
And what else is like that,
if I'm hearing you correctly?

40:27.859 --> 40:30.895
Being a boss.

40:30.895 --> 40:35.166
One slipup, and the searchlight
comes on hot and fast.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.302
Tell me about it.

40:39.404 --> 40:42.573
Pop told me I took
the press conference personally.

40:42.573 --> 40:45.143
That I was expecting
you'd act more like

40:45.143 --> 40:47.078
a protective father
than the PC.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.113
And what do you think?

40:49.113 --> 40:52.517
That my mistake was acting
like a respectful daughter,

40:52.517 --> 40:55.053
letting you have the last word.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.224
And the next time?

41:00.224 --> 41:03.461
I will always
be respectful of you.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.464
Couldn't be
any other way, but...

41:06.464 --> 41:09.100
I need to respect
my office, too.

41:13.538 --> 41:17.642
And maybe keep the joint press
conferences to a minimum.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.678
Yeah. That, too.

41:22.246 --> 41:24.482
Ooh.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.085
Well, what do you know.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.020
Results.
