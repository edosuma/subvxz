00:13.079 --> 00:14.580
<i>we know she didn't mean it.</i>

<i>Burt got rid of his depression</i>
<i>over dying</i>

00:16.583 --> 00:18.584
<i>by trying to get into</i>

00:18.585 --> 00:19.585
<i>Jodie got depressed</i>

00:19.586 --> 00:21.086

<i>and until he found a nanny,</i>

01:24.651 --> 01:26.151
I don't get it.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.152
I don't get it.

01:27.153 --> 01:28.654
As soon as our head
hits the pillow,

01:28.655 --> 01:30.155
she turns into a fire engine.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.156
She's teething, Burt.
Teething? Teething?

01:31.157 --> 01:33.158
She's been teething for a month.

01:33.159 --> 01:34.660
What is she, a walrus?

01:34.661 --> 01:36.662
Teething? Teething?

01:36.663 --> 01:38.163
When they're babies,
they cry from teething,

01:38.164 --> 01:39.164
then they get braces

01:39.165 --> 01:41.166
and they walk around
for a couple of years

01:41.167 --> 01:43.168
looking like a '56 Buick.

01:43.169 --> 01:44.670
Then they need caps.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.171
There's braces,
and night braces,

01:46.172 --> 01:47.673
retainers,

01:47.674 --> 01:49.174
rubber bands flying
out of their mouths,

01:49.175 --> 01:51.677
smack you in the eye...

01:51.678 --> 01:55.180
Mare, in the mouth of a teenager
lives the national debt.

01:55.181 --> 01:57.182
Burt, you're raving.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.684
I get a little irrational

01:58.685 --> 02:00.186
when I haven't slept
in six weeks.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.188
I'm glad I can't sleep.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.691
I get nauseous when I lie down.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.693
I can feel the baby kicking me.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.695
It's a wonderful feeling.

02:09.696 --> 02:12.197
I lie there in the dark,
feel a little kick,

02:12.198 --> 02:14.700
giggle like crazy,
and then throw up.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.204
God, I'm starving.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.707
Well, as long as I'm up,

02:21.708 --> 02:24.209
I may as well take
another shot at this here.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.212
Mare, for the <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records,</i>

02:27.213 --> 02:29.715
11:58 PM.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.220
Hey. Hi, Burt.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.221
Hi, Jodie.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.723
I'm, uh, real sorry about this.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.224
No problem.
I love it. I love it.

02:39.225 --> 02:40.726
We get to come down here...

02:40.727 --> 02:41.728
talk, I don't know.

02:42.729 --> 02:43.729
Hey, Wendy, Wendy...

02:44.731 --> 02:46.231
Grandpa.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.232
BOB: That's it.
I'm moving out.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.233
Bob...
Don't "Bob" me.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.735
I'm leaving.

02:49.736 --> 02:50.736
It's started again,

02:50.737 --> 02:52.738
every night, all night long.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.239
I can't stand it anymore.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
Come on, Bob.

02:55.241 --> 02:56.742
She's just a little baby.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.243
I'm not talking
about her, Dr. J.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.745
I'm talking about you.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.248
All night long with that ball.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.251
Ka-ching. Ka-ching.
Ka-ching.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.253
A screen, and...

03:08.254 --> 03:09.755
shoot it already, damn it!

03:14.761 --> 03:16.261
Bob, Dad is trying to get into

03:16.262 --> 03:17.763
the <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records.</i>

03:17.764 --> 03:19.765
For what?
Being a nudge?

03:19.766 --> 03:21.266
Reminds me
of my cousin Pinocchio.

03:21.267 --> 03:22.768
What a pain in the rear he his.

03:22.769 --> 03:25.270
"I want to be a real, live boy!

03:25.271 --> 03:26.772
I want to be
a real, live boy!"

03:26.773 --> 03:28.273
All night long.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.775
It could make you throw up.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.282
Hi.

03:37.283 --> 03:39.785
Carol.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.787
May I come in?

03:41.788 --> 03:43.790
Sure.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.299
How have you been?

03:54.300 --> 03:56.301
Fine.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.302
Fine.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.804
Fine.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.806
Ms. Warmth.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.808
Oh, well,
we better get dressed, Mare,

04:02.809 --> 04:04.309
we're going to make that movie.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.311
Let's go.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.312
Movie?

04:07.313 --> 04:08.394
Burt, it's midnight, and...

04:12.819 --> 04:14.820
I'll put on a skirt.
I won't be a minute.

04:14.821 --> 04:15.821
Hi, Mary.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.322
Hi, Carol.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.825
Excuse me. I have to throw up.

04:22.829 --> 04:25.330
Uh, Chuck,
do you think you and... Yeah.

04:25.331 --> 04:26.832
Uh, Bob, why don't we
go for a walk.

04:26.833 --> 04:27.833
Yeah. Oh, hi there, Carol.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.334
Long time no see.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.335
Bob.

04:30.336 --> 04:31.837
Listen, did you get that, uh,

04:31.838 --> 04:34.840
Mother's Day card that we sent?

04:34.841 --> 04:35.841
Well, I-I guess not.

04:35.842 --> 04:40.345
Good night little Wendy,
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.352
You look well.

04:47.353 --> 04:48.854
You were, what,
in the neighborhood

04:48.855 --> 04:50.355
and thought you'd just, uh,
drop by?

04:50.356 --> 04:51.857
Something like that, yes.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.864
God, she's beautiful.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.867
More beautiful than I remember.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.368
You got some memory.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.870
She looks like you.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.372
When she's awake and screaming

05:07.373 --> 05:08.874
I think she looks like me,

05:08.875 --> 05:09.875
but right now I think

05:09.876 --> 05:11.036
she looks a lot like her m...

05:13.379 --> 05:14.880
I think she looks like you.

05:16.883 --> 05:17.884
She's incredible.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.385
So how you been?

05:20.386 --> 05:21.887
Good, good.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.889
What happened to the, uh...

05:23.890 --> 05:25.390
the cowboy?

05:25.391 --> 05:26.391
Oh, he's here.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.893
We came into town together
for the rodeo.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.394
Is the rodeo in town?

05:29.395 --> 05:33.399
Damn, my chaps
are in the cleaner's.

05:34.901 --> 05:35.901
May I hold her?

05:35.902 --> 05:38.905
Of course.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.416
Oh, God.

05:56.403 --> 05:57.923
Carol, would you mind
putting her down?

05:57.924 --> 05:59.424
I...really want her
to sleep.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.426
Okay.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.941
You don't seem
too happy to see me.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.443
Carol, you come into my life

06:18.444 --> 06:19.945
like a sailor on leave,

06:19.946 --> 06:21.947
tell me
I'm going to be a father,

06:21.948 --> 06:22.948
then leave me at the altar,

06:22.949 --> 06:24.950
prevent me from seeing my child,

06:24.951 --> 06:25.951
then you abandon her.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.452
And now here you are again,

06:27.453 --> 06:29.955
and you don't understand
why I'm not happy to see you?

06:29.956 --> 06:30.956
Well, excuse me

06:30.957 --> 06:33.458
if you are not my choice
for woman of the year.

06:33.459 --> 06:34.459
You don't know
what I went through...

06:34.460 --> 06:35.460
It's late.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.963
We've got to get to sleep.

06:37.964 --> 06:38.964
I understand.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.466
I'm sorry.

06:45.911 --> 06:47.472
We'll be here
till the end of the month.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.974
May I see her again?

06:50.476 --> 06:51.476
Sure.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.978
Thank you.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.982
Bye-bye, honey.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.485
Her name is Wendy.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.488
See you.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.500
Shh.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.509
Mother. Mother.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.011
Mother, will you listen to me?

07:26.012 --> 07:28.513
Mrs. Fader got killed by a lion
on a safari in Africa.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.015
You live in Queens.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.017
What do you mean, you're next?

07:32.018 --> 07:34.519
It had nothing to do with you.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.522
She stepped out of a Land Rover
and tried to sit on a lion.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.525
What has that
got to do with you?

07:40.526 --> 07:43.028
Mother, we all wish
people were dead some time.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.532
You don't have to feel guilty,
Mother.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.534
I'm a psychiatrist.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.536
You can take my word for it.

07:51.537 --> 07:54.039
Fine. What do I know?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.042
Your time is up, Mother.

08:04.550 --> 08:07.052
Mrs. Tate.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.554
I'm not crazy.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.057
I'm sure you're not, Mrs. Tate.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.058
Come in.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.560
You see, I'm here
because of my children.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.062
They wanted me to come here.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.063
I understand.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.064
Sit down.

08:19.065 --> 08:22.067
Do you really understand,

08:22.068 --> 08:23.568
or are you just saying that
to humor me

08:23.569 --> 08:25.570
because actually,
you really do think I'm crazy?

08:25.571 --> 08:27.072
I don't think you're crazy,
Mrs. Tate.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.073
Believe me.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.574
Sit down.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.076
The patients

08:31.077 --> 08:32.077
are generally
not the crazy ones.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.078
We are.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.082
Well, that's very funny.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.583
That really is very funny.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.586
Oh, well,
I feel much better now.

08:41.587 --> 08:44.089
You see,
I was a little depressed.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.091
That's why my children
wanted me to come here.

08:46.092 --> 08:49.094
Now you've made me laugh,
and I feel so much better.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.097
I really want to thank you
for that, Doctor.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.599
Goodbye.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.101
You have 48 minutes left.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.603
That much?

08:59.105 --> 09:01.106
Well, I just want you
to know, Doctor,

09:01.107 --> 09:03.108
I have no intention

09:03.109 --> 09:05.610
of being entirely honest
about everything.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.613
There are some things
I prefer to lie about.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.115
That should be helpful.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.118
Well, that just about does it.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.619
Time's up.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.121
47 minutes left.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.625
Of course, I do have one aunt,
a distant aunt,

09:20.626 --> 09:22.627
very, very distant...
She lives in Portugal...

09:22.628 --> 09:26.131
and she is a little crazy.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.632
She thinks she's royalty.

09:27.633 --> 09:28.633
Wears a little crown everywhere.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.635
You know, to the market,
to the beach.

09:30.636 --> 09:34.139
Last year declared war on Spain.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.642
Uh, Doctor...

09:37.643 --> 09:39.644
I don't mean to be personal,

09:39.645 --> 09:43.148
but why do you have
a punching bag in your office?

09:43.149 --> 09:45.150
It's to help people
get rid of their anger.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.652
They pretend the bag
is someone they're mad at,

09:47.653 --> 09:49.154
and they punch it.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.156
I see.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.158
Would you like to try it?

09:53.159 --> 09:54.159
Oh, no, no.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.660
Thank you.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.162
I might break my nails.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.663
It can be very helpful,
Mrs. Tate.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.666
I have used it myself
on occasion.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.169
Who do you pretend it is?

10:04.170 --> 10:05.171
It depends.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.175
Well, I used to pretend
it was my wife.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.676
Used to?

10:11.677 --> 10:13.678
We're divorced now.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.180
We've been divorced
quite some time.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.182
I see.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.684
I'm entirely over it now,

10:19.685 --> 10:21.186
but then...

10:21.187 --> 10:23.188
well...

10:23.189 --> 10:25.690
I guess I used to get
pretty upset about things.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.192
Like what?

10:28.194 --> 10:29.194
Like what?

10:29.195 --> 10:30.196
Mm-hmm.

10:31.697 --> 10:35.700
The woman was having an affair
with our next-door neighbor.

10:35.701 --> 10:36.701
No.

10:36.702 --> 10:37.702
Yes.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.204
He used to come over
all the time

10:39.205 --> 10:40.205
and borrow my tools.

10:40.206 --> 10:45.210
I had no idea
what else he was borrowing.

10:45.211 --> 10:48.213
She had an affair
with our son's orthodontist.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.715
He charges me six grand,
sleeps with my wife,

10:50.716 --> 10:52.217
and my kid
still looks like a rabbit.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.721
She slept with the pediatrician.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.223
She slept with the pool man.

10:58.224 --> 10:59.224
She slept with the gas man.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.726
She slept with the plumber.

11:02.509 --> 11:04.229
She slept with anyone
who rang the doorbell,

11:04.230 --> 11:05.730
and I never knew it.

11:05.731 --> 11:06.731
All I ever knew was,

11:06.732 --> 11:10.235
whenever we got into bed,
she was too tired.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.237
Too tired.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.240
It's a wonder
she was still alive!

11:15.741 --> 11:17.742
Maybe she slept with Chester.

11:17.743 --> 11:18.743
Who's Chester?

11:18.744 --> 11:19.744
My husband.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.247
If he drove down our street,
odds are, she did.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.751
Doctor?

11:27.253 --> 11:28.753
Are you all right?

11:28.754 --> 11:30.755
Of course.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.257
I was just demonstrating.

11:32.258 --> 11:35.760
Your wife sounds
a lot like my husband.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.761
Oh?

11:36.762 --> 11:39.264
My husband just left me
for another woman.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.266
Oh.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.267
Well, actually, not a woman.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.769
A teenybopper.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.271
Well, it's easy to see, then,

11:46.272 --> 11:48.773
why you're so depressed,
Mrs. Tate.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.276
I guess it's normal
to feel depressed.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.777
Oh, hell, yes.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.279
After I found out about my wife,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.781
I was so depressed,
I couldn't get out of bed.

11:56.782 --> 11:59.784
Neither could she,
which is why I was so depressed.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.786
Believe me, Mrs. Tate,

12:01.787 --> 12:03.288
you are reacting normally.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.290
I'd be worried about you
if you weren't depressed.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.791
Now, why don't you try

12:06.792 --> 12:09.294
to get rid
of some of your anger.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.295
Go on. Punch it.

12:10.296 --> 12:11.796
But I'm not angry, really.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.798
Oh, come on, you've got
to be a little angry.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.800
No, really, nothing.

12:15.801 --> 12:18.803
After what your husband did,
you're not the least bit angry?

12:18.804 --> 12:19.804
No.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.306
Think of what he did.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.308
Think of how he treated you.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.309
The cheating.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.310
The deception.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.312
All those years.

12:27.313 --> 12:28.813
All those lies.

12:28.814 --> 12:31.316
All those women.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.833
I guess I was a little angry.

12:52.338 --> 12:55.341
I-I'm so sorry.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.359
Hi, Burt.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.361
22 hours.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.364
22 hours
I've been dribbling this.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.367
Burt...
I dribbled in the train.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.868
I dribbled down the street.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.871
I dribbled in the subway,
where I almost got killed.

13:26.872 --> 13:31.376
Four black guys
tried to take it from me.

13:31.377 --> 13:34.379
And what happens in your office?

13:34.380 --> 13:37.882
One of your stupid nurses
slaps it out of my hands.

13:37.883 --> 13:38.883
Sorry.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.385
What is wrong with her?

13:40.386 --> 13:41.386
Where is her mind?

13:41.387 --> 13:42.387
She takes a person's basketball

13:42.388 --> 13:43.888
in the middle of a dribble?

13:43.889 --> 13:45.890
I'm sure she didn't realize.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.392
22 hours.

13:47.393 --> 13:48.893
I have to start all over again.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.395
I'm sorry, Burt.
I'll talk to her.

13:50.396 --> 13:51.396
Which one was it?

13:51.397 --> 13:52.897
The blond.

13:52.898 --> 13:55.400
The one who looks
like a transvestite.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.402
I'll talk to her.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.403
Sit down, Burt.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.404
This better be important,

13:59.405 --> 14:00.405
why I'm here.

14:00.406 --> 14:01.906
After what I just
went through here,

14:01.907 --> 14:02.907
this better be big.

14:02.908 --> 14:03.908
It is big, Burt.

14:03.909 --> 14:06.411
Something happened yesterday.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.413
I lost a patient.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.920
You're having
a really terrific month here.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.923
See, about the time
you came in for your physical,

14:18.924 --> 14:20.425
this other guy
came in to see me too.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.926
Well, he checked out fine.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.428
Perfect health.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.430
Yesterday, he died.

14:28.434 --> 14:31.436
I-I-I-I did an autopsy, Burt.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.939
He had your disease.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.941
W-What?

14:36.942 --> 14:38.943
What do you mean?
What do you mean?

14:38.944 --> 14:40.945
Well, you know, I mean,
I have no time left?

14:40.946 --> 14:42.447
You gave me five months.
No.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.448
What... This... You mean...

14:43.449 --> 14:44.449
Ah.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.950
What do you mean, this is it?

14:45.951 --> 14:47.952
I mean, right now, any second,
pfft, I could just...

14:47.953 --> 14:48.953
I'm getting dizzy here.

14:48.954 --> 14:49.954
That's it. Doc.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.956
Hold me. Doc.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.458
I can... I feel it.

14:53.459 --> 14:54.959
That's it. The heart's stopped.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.461
It's gone.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.462
No, Burt, no.

14:57.463 --> 14:58.463
Doc, I'm going, I'm going.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.964
You tell Mary I love her.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.466
Burt, you're not dying.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.467
Give my eyes to some blind guy.

15:02.468 --> 15:03.968
I got 20/20 vision.

15:03.969 --> 15:04.969
But just tell him,

15:04.970 --> 15:07.972
remember, vodka makes them red.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.474
Burt, it was a mistake.

15:09.475 --> 15:10.975
Am I dead yet?

15:10.976 --> 15:12.477
This is taking a very long time.

15:12.478 --> 15:13.478
Burt, you're not dying.

15:13.479 --> 15:14.979
The lab made a mistake.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.482
He had the disease, not you.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.485
You mean I don't have...

15:20.986 --> 15:22.487
I never had...

15:22.488 --> 15:24.489
I'm not now... I don't...
I'm alive?

15:24.490 --> 15:25.490
I'm living?

15:25.491 --> 15:27.492
I'm going to...
I'm not going to die?

15:27.493 --> 15:28.493
Whoo-hoo!

15:28.494 --> 15:29.994
Doc! Oh, Doc!

15:29.995 --> 15:31.496
Doc! Mm!

15:33.999 --> 15:35.500
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

15:35.501 --> 15:36.501
I feel awful.

15:36.502 --> 15:39.504
That poor guy died
and I'm happy.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.005
Oh, if it's any help at all,
Burt,

15:41.006 --> 15:42.507
he was a terrible guy.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.009
See, that's why I got so upset
when I thought you were dying.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.511
I said, "Why Burt?

15:46.512 --> 15:49.014
Why should Cookie live
and Burt die?"

15:50.015 --> 15:52.016
His name was Cookie.

15:52.017 --> 15:56.020
You can imagine
a man named Cookie.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.523
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute here.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.024
How do you make
a mistake like this?

16:00.025 --> 16:01.025
How?

16:01.026 --> 16:02.527
How do you make this mistake?

16:02.528 --> 16:03.528
Computer error.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.530
Computer error?

16:05.531 --> 16:06.531
It happens, Burt.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.032
Computer error?

16:08.033 --> 16:09.033
We're talking
life and death here,

16:09.034 --> 16:11.035
not Mastercharge.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.038
I almost dove
off the Flatiron Building.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.040
They're ruining our lives,
these computers.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.041
I had a friend once,

16:17.042 --> 16:19.043
shot the computer,
it made him so crazy.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.044
Computers.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.046
You ever make a mistake
on your bill, forget it.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.549
Once it's in the computer,
it's there for life.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.050
I'm glad you brought that up,
Burt.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.552
See, unfortunately,

16:27.553 --> 16:29.053
the computer
thinks you're dying,

16:29.054 --> 16:31.055
and it contacted
other computers.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.558
You know, bank computers,
charge card computers.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.560
See, some dying people

16:35.561 --> 16:37.562
like to charge up a storm
before they go,

16:37.563 --> 16:39.564
so now, since all the computers
think you're dying,

16:39.565 --> 16:41.566
you've become a bad credit risk.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.067
If I were you,

16:43.068 --> 16:45.070
the next few months,
I'd use cash.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.594
Ooh. Making lunch?

17:09.595 --> 17:11.596
Good. I'm starved.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.097
It's for the baby, Ma.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.598
What is it?

17:14.599 --> 17:16.099
Strained spinach,
strained carrots,

17:16.101 --> 17:18.102
and strained beets.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.605
I think I'll just have
a cup of coffee.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.608
Why can't they make
strained Lobster Neuberg

17:23.608 --> 17:26.109
or strained chocolate mousse?

17:26.111 --> 17:28.112
I'd love to go out some night

17:28.113 --> 17:30.615
and eat something
I actually had to chew.

17:30.616 --> 17:31.616
Well, why don't you, dear?

17:31.617 --> 17:33.618
You know, I could
watch little Timmy.

17:33.619 --> 17:34.619
Oh, it's not easy dating

17:34.620 --> 17:36.120
when you have a kid, Mom.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.622
Men seem to run the other way.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.123
Don't I know it.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.625
What?

17:40.626 --> 17:41.626
Well, look at me.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.627
I have four.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.128
Am I dating?

17:44.129 --> 17:48.633
But all your children
are grown up.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.134
No, I mean a relationship.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.636
You know, some nice guy

17:51.637 --> 17:55.139
who's... Who's bright
and funny and caring.

17:55.140 --> 17:58.142
Someone who asks me
questions about myself.

17:58.143 --> 18:00.645
Someone who's cares
about what I think.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.647
You know, a friend
as well as a lover.

18:02.648 --> 18:06.651
And failing that,
someone with a nice car.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.653
Oh, Corinne...

18:08.654 --> 18:09.654
Hi.

18:09.655 --> 18:10.655
JESSICA:
Hello, Billy.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.156
You're home early.

18:12.157 --> 18:13.157
I never went out.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.158
Oh, that's strange.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.660
You've been spending

18:15.661 --> 18:17.161
so much time
away from home lately.

18:17.162 --> 18:19.163
Oh, Billy,

18:19.164 --> 18:20.665
you're not ill, are you?

18:20.666 --> 18:22.166
I'm great. I feel fine.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.668
How's Leslie?

18:23.669 --> 18:25.169
She's great. Fine.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.170
She's terrific.

18:26.171 --> 18:27.672
It must be so nice

18:27.673 --> 18:30.174
to have someone
you can spend time with.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.175
It's the best.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.176
Where is she now?

18:32.177 --> 18:34.178
Who cares?

18:34.179 --> 18:36.180
Billy...

18:36.181 --> 18:37.682
I didn't mean that, Mom.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.183
It's just...

18:39.184 --> 18:41.686
she wants to see me
all the time,

18:41.687 --> 18:43.688
and I really care for her.
She's a wonderful person.

18:43.689 --> 18:46.691
But I'm just too young
to commit all my time to her.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.692
Do you believe this?

18:47.693 --> 18:50.194
Here we are
dying for what you have,

18:50.195 --> 18:51.696
and you don't want it.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.198
What's with this family
and relationships?

18:56.702 --> 18:58.202
Oh, ho, ho...

18:58.203 --> 19:00.705
ho...

19:00.706 --> 19:02.707
Is something the matter, Dutch?

19:02.708 --> 19:03.708
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.209
Everything is Jake.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.712
You seem a little depressed.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.213
I found this on my pillow.

19:09.214 --> 19:10.715
What is it?
It's a letter.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.216
I know that, dear.

19:12.217 --> 19:13.718
I mean what is in it?

19:13.719 --> 19:15.720
Well, I haven't read it yet.
I'm too scared.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.721
Well, who's it from?

19:16.722 --> 19:18.723
It ain't from the tooth fairy.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.224
It's Eunice.

19:20.225 --> 19:21.225
She wants me out.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.728
Now, Dutch,
we don't know that for sure.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.730
Yeah, this is goodbye.
That's what this is.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.732
I got 24 hours
to get out of her life.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.233
I'm getting the boot,
the old wazoo,

19:29.234 --> 19:30.735
the long goodbye.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.737
Why don't you read it?

19:32.738 --> 19:33.738
I can't.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.740
If this says
what I think it says,

19:35.741 --> 19:37.241
I'll go nuts.

19:37.242 --> 19:40.244
Uh, now, Dutch,

19:40.245 --> 19:41.746
I know that your
natural instinct

19:41.747 --> 19:43.748
is to tear the kitchen to pieces

19:43.749 --> 19:45.249
and throw it, piece by piece,

19:45.250 --> 19:46.751
into the pool,

19:46.752 --> 19:49.253
but you're a mature,
intelligent man,

19:49.254 --> 19:50.755
and I'm sure
you can take any news,

19:50.756 --> 19:51.756
good or bad,

19:51.757 --> 19:54.258
with dignity and decorum.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.760
Thanks.

19:55.761 --> 19:58.262
Would you like one of us
to read it for you?

19:58.263 --> 19:59.263
If you don't mind.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.265
Oh, there's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.767
There's nothing we humans

20:02.768 --> 20:05.269
can't handle
like the British do.

20:05.270 --> 20:08.773
Has anyone seen Irv?

20:08.774 --> 20:10.775
Who?
My pigeon.

20:10.776 --> 20:14.278
I sent him across the lines
with the prescription to fill

20:14.279 --> 20:18.783
and he hasn't returned,
the damn bird.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.284
Oh.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.786
Exactly.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.789
It's a lousy letter, ain't it?

20:24.790 --> 20:26.290
No, not at all, not at all.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.792
Look, neatly typed.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.795
It's in a new envelope,
nicely folded.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.296
Read it to me.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.297
Fine.

20:33.298 --> 20:35.800
Fine, but...

20:35.801 --> 20:37.301
we're going to play
a little game first.

20:37.302 --> 20:40.304
It's called "tie-up."

20:40.305 --> 20:44.308
You see, we are going to
tie you up real tight,

20:44.309 --> 20:46.310
and then we'll read the letter.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.312
Won't that be fun?

20:48.313 --> 20:50.815
Oh, please.
I can handle it, really.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.817
I-I believe you, Dutch.
I believe you.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.820
Corinne, you read the letter.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.326
"Dear Dutch..."

21:02.327 --> 21:03.327
You see?
There's a good sign.

21:03.328 --> 21:04.328
"Dear."

21:04.329 --> 21:07.331
I mean, she could have
started it, "Hey, Jerko."

21:07.332 --> 21:09.333
Read.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.335
"Dear Dutch...

21:11.336 --> 21:12.837
I've run off with another man."

21:12.838 --> 21:14.338
Okay, okay.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.339
Little setback.
No problem.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.841
Shake it off.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.843
Read.

21:18.844 --> 21:21.846
"Please don't take this
as a reflection on you."

21:21.847 --> 21:22.847
Better.
Billy.

21:22.848 --> 21:23.848
Read.

21:23.849 --> 21:26.851
"But I have to leave you.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.853
"Please don't try to find me.

21:28.854 --> 21:29.854
"It's easier this way.

21:29.855 --> 21:30.856
Eunice."

21:36.361 --> 21:37.361
God, look at the time.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.362
Well, so long, everybody.

21:38.363 --> 21:39.864
I'd better run.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.870
How are you feeling, Dutch?

21:45.871 --> 21:47.872
Don't worry.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.374
I'm not going to do nothing.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.876
I'd better go and pack.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.377
What for?

21:53.378 --> 21:54.879
I can't live here no more.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.380
Eunice is gone.

21:56.381 --> 21:57.381
So?

21:57.382 --> 21:58.382
Well, you're her family.

21:58.383 --> 22:01.385
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Eunice.

22:01.386 --> 22:03.387
I-I wouldn't be anywhere
if it wasn't for Eunice,

22:03.388 --> 22:04.388
so I'd better just go.

22:04.389 --> 22:05.890
Dutch, wait.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.392
Now, we're your family now.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.393
Nah.

22:09.394 --> 22:13.898
I appreciate you saying that,
but that ain't true.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.901
Now, Dutch, you listen to me.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.903
You are not only
a part of this family,

22:18.904 --> 22:21.405
but technically,
you are the man of the house.

22:21.406 --> 22:25.409
I mean, we have just recently
lost two husbands here,

22:25.410 --> 22:26.911
and I simply will not tolerate

22:26.912 --> 22:29.414
another man
walking out of this house.

22:30.415 --> 22:31.916
Dinner's at six.

22:31.917 --> 22:32.918
Please don't be tardy.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.428
Your mother's
really a nice person.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.931
We all feel the same way, Dutch.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.933
Almost all.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.936
Feel like talking?

22:52.437 --> 22:53.938
No.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.941
Feel like crying?

22:58.443 --> 22:59.944
I haven't cried since, uh...

22:59.945 --> 23:02.446
I don't cry.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.949
Well, then...

23:04.950 --> 23:06.952
would it help if I held you?

23:25.003 --> 23:27.471
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Will seeing a psychiatrist help Jessica?</i>

23:27.472 --> 23:29.473
<i>Will seeing Jessica</i>
<i>help the psychiatrist?</i>

23:29.474 --> 23:30.975

23:30.976 --> 23:32.476

<i>with her room?</i>

23:32.477 --> 23:34.478
<i>Her clothes? Her man?</i>

23:34.479 --> 23:36.480
<i>Did Carol just drop by</i>
<i>to see the baby</i>

23:36.481 --> 23:38.482
<i>or does she really want</i>
<i>something else?</i>

23:38.483 --> 23:40.484

23:40.485 --> 23:42.987
