00:01.100 --> 00:03.125
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.230 --> 00:04.197
Wait.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.297
We're all in
this together,

00:07.400 --> 00:09.709
that could be "A"
or it could be Alison.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.562
Has anyone
talked to Ali?

00:11.670 --> 00:13.399
She calls,
but I don't pick up.

00:13.510 --> 00:14.534
You guys,
I had a bad thought.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.005
What's this one?

00:16.110 --> 00:17.668
Ali left town,
but "A" said she couldn't.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.179
What changed?

00:19.280 --> 00:21.419
I enrolled at
the Harrisburg Police Academy.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.782
You can't just
become a policeman.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.016
Why not?

00:24.120 --> 00:25.280
Paige, we need to talk.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.516
Yeah, we should talk.

00:26.620 --> 00:27.609
Tanner thinks
we killed Bethany Young.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.051
Spencer, I don't
think the police

00:29.160 --> 00:30.559
believe a thing
that All is saying.

00:31.890 --> 00:32.925
MELISSA: She was a stranger
and I buried her alive,

00:33.030 --> 00:35.555
because I thought
I was protecting you.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.298
Melissa killed
Bethany Young.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.231
She thought that
she just buried her.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.432
She thought
that I killed her.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.529
I'm not talking
to Tanner.

00:41.640 --> 00:42.629
Neither am I.

00:42.740 --> 00:43.638
I_didn't think
It was you.

00:43.740 --> 00:44.638
Oh, my God.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.661
Alison.

00:45.770 --> 00:47.078
When she
finishes with me,

00:47.180 --> 00:49.444
she'll come after
you and the others.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.699
She can't
trust you anymore.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.165
I'll take your statements
now, one at a time.

01:18.270 --> 01:19.578
Hanna, let's head
over to the porch.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.578
You can walk me
through this.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.102
No.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.178
No, I-I-I can't
go back up there.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.201
I don't want
to see that again.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.551
You saw
all the blood in there.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.548
There's no way anyone could
have lived through that.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.568
( cell phone chimes )

01:48.770 --> 01:51.762
"It's all your fault.
A."

02:02.290 --> 02:04.645
I'm going to ask you
a series of questions

02:04.750 --> 02:06.115
that we know
are true.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.785
Then I will ask you questions
that we don't know.

02:10.890 --> 02:13.450
Your body's responses
will indicate

02:13.560 --> 02:15.653
whether you're being
honest with us or not.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.660
Maybe we should
wait for Tanner.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.662
When you tell the truth,
you use your memory.

02:23.770 --> 02:27.137
When you lie,
you're using your imagination.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.401
The sensors
will detect that change.

02:29.510 --> 02:32.411
Do you understand
how it works?

02:32.520 --> 02:33.669
Answer verbally.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.873
I understand.

02:35.980 --> 02:39.381
So we'll begin.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.889
Are you sitting down?

02:40.990 --> 02:43.550
Yes.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.628
_ What color
IS your shirt?

02:45.730 --> 02:47.550
White with pink flowers.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.427
State your legal name.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.659
Alison Lauren DiLaurentis.

02:56.370 --> 02:58.634
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

02:58.740 --> 03:01.402
* Swear this one
you'll save *

03:01.510 --> 03:03.569
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:03.680 --> 03:06.319
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:06.420 --> 03:08.240
* If I show you,
then I know *

03:08.350 --> 03:11.319
* You won't tell
what I saId *

03:11.420 --> 03:13.684
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:13.790 --> 03:15.883
* If one
of them is dead *

03:17.360 --> 03:19.658
( Ne Me Quitte Pas
music playing )

03:35.410 --> 03:36.707
( knocking on door)

03:36.810 --> 03:37.742
Come in.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.612
You've got company.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.449
Who is it?

03:43.550 --> 03:44.949
Come see for yourself.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.636
Why the grim faces?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.435
Did somebody die?

04:03.570 --> 04:04.832
Mona,
we need your help.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.372
What did she do to you?

04:09.480 --> 04:10.378
Nothing...

04:10.480 --> 04:11.606
yet.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.314
It's what we think
she's about to do.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.910
We just found out that
Ali's at the police station.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.647
She's talking
to the cops.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.547
And you don't know
what she's telling them.

04:18.650 --> 04:20.811
A lie gets halfway
around the world

04:20.920 --> 04:23.286
before the truth has
a chance to get Its pants on.

04:23.390 --> 04:24.425
Did Ali say that?

04:24.530 --> 04:25.827
N0. Churchill did.
Churchill did.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.294
Look, we've been lying for Ali
ever since she got back.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.391
We need to know what story
she's telling the cops.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.694
So why not
ask her?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.791
Because we don't believe
she'll tell us the truth.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.629
And why do you think
that I can help you?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.008
Because you're Mona.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.941
Who else was
in the barn that night?

04:48.350 --> 04:50.887
Aria Montgomery.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.685
Hanna Marin.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.758
And Emily Fields.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.421
When you left the barn,
were they all still sleeping?

04:58.530 --> 05:00.293
Yes.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.425
Where did you last see
Spencer Hastings?

05:06.070 --> 05:07.958
Alison stole
my life from me

05:08.070 --> 05:10.800
when she cr_owned me
Rosewood's biggest loser.

05:12.580 --> 05:16.505
And she was so convincing,
even I started to believe her.

05:16.610 --> 05:18.578
So that means
you'll help us?

05:18.680 --> 05:20.910
Look, I know I owe you guys
for everything I've done to you.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.915
But I'm already number one
on her hit list.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.955
If Alison finds out
I'm siding with you guys,

05:28.060 --> 05:30.824
I'm afraid to think of how
far she'd go to stop me.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.818
Are you really
that scared of her?

05:32.930 --> 05:34.022
Aren't you?

05:39.470 --> 05:41.529
_ I don't mean
to Interrupt your girl-talk,

05:41.640 --> 05:43.835
but I wanted to bring these
out while they're still warm.

05:43.940 --> 05:46.067
Hanna, is chocolate chip
still your favorite?

05:46.170 --> 05:48.434
So nice of you.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.076
But we have to go.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.573
Oh, I'll send some
home with you.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.612
I'll be right back.

05:56.650 --> 05:58.049
Have you ever been
so focused on something

05:58.150 --> 06:01.415
that it takes over
everything else?

06:01.520 --> 06:02.851
Turns you into someone
that you're not?

06:05.560 --> 06:08.757
I took all of my Ali-anger
out on you guys and...

06:08.860 --> 06:09.895
I'm sorry for that.

06:15.970 --> 06:17.506
Han.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.407
I'm waiting
for the cookies.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.670
Did you figure out
what you're gonna do

06:24.780 --> 06:26.042
with your sister's
going-away present?

06:26.150 --> 06:27.617
Melissa sent me
that video

06:27.720 --> 06:28.914
because she wanted me
to know the truth.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.783
Her confession doesn't
actually help any of us.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.039
She said it out loud.

06:32.150 --> 06:33.048
She buried Bethany.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.286
She killed her.

06:34.390 --> 06:36.620
Yeah, because she thought that
I was the one who hit her.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.049
But you didn't.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.422
We all know that,
Spence.

06:39.530 --> 06:40.690
It doesn't matter.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.927
In Melissa's story
I'm an accessory to murder.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.463
That's best case scenario.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.101
Here you go.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.609
Thank you, Mrs. V.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.031
And they are
still my favorite.

06:54.140 --> 06:56.028
See you at school?

06:56.140 --> 06:57.072
Yeah.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.586
Well, it was nice
to see you.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.615
Hanna”.

07:07.790 --> 07:10.520
I need to ask.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.688
Now that she's back...

07:12.830 --> 07:16.869
Alison,
is it starting again?

07:16.970 --> 07:19.632
I'm not friends
with Alison anymore.

07:19.740 --> 07:23.039
So I don't really don't know
what she's doing.

07:23.140 --> 07:26.701
But I do think that
Mona's afraid of her.

07:26.810 --> 07:27.834
We all are.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.840
( phone ringing )

07:37.920 --> 07:39.444
Send out a code "A".

07:39.560 --> 07:40.959
She's plotting
something big.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.586
( knocking on door)

07:47.230 --> 07:48.458
Lock the door.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.788
I think somebody
is following me.

07:52.270 --> 07:53.498
Where is everybody?

07:55.940 --> 07:56.929
They're not coming.

07:58.810 --> 07:59.879
Why?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.504
Alison got to them.

08:01.610 --> 08:03.146
They're convinced
that she's the saint

08:03.250 --> 08:06.742
and you're
"crazy Mona".

08:07.920 --> 08:09.615
That's what they're
calling you now.

08:19.330 --> 08:22.766
Do you think you can be
crazy and not know it?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.599
If you start
to believe that, she wins.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.988
I'm talking
about Alison.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.705
I think she's gone
full-on socio.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.899
Alison volunteered
to take the polygraph.

08:37.010 --> 08:37.908
How do you know that?

08:38.010 --> 08:39.204
She's Mona.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.914
After you left last night,
I did some recon.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.647
Alison would never
put herself at rIsk

08:42.750 --> 08:44.581
unless she
believed her story.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.817
Well, if you believe a lie,
it becomes a truth.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.979
And why lie
to yourself unless...

08:49.090 --> 08:50.523
You did
something so bad

08:50.630 --> 08:52.029
you don't want
to believe that you did it.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.791
Or you're
playing a game.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.869
You think that Ali took
the lie detector test for fun?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.188
I think she took it because
she's not having fun anymore.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.189
She can't play with her dolls
if you won't let her.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.200
This is how
she's ending the game.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.208
What game?

09:05.310 --> 09:06.231
The game.

09:06.340 --> 09:07.830
The one she
stole from me.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.271
You think
that Alison's "A"?

09:10.880 --> 09:12.916
I'm not the only one
having bad thoughts.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.719
She assembled
the perfect group.

09:17.820 --> 09:20.311
Smart, loyal,

09:20.420 --> 09:23.548
admiring
and compassionate.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.793
Perfect group for what?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.822
For a sociopath
to manipulate.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.966
Alison would have gotten
bored with any one of you.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.094
But all together...

09:32.200 --> 09:34.339
We're a challenge.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.931
I never understood
why Alison chose me,

09:37.040 --> 09:38.701
what made me
so speCIal.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.004
When you don't
feel anything,

09:40.110 --> 09:43.648
it must be really fun to mess
with somebody who feels a lot.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.706
Alison picked you
because you care.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.243
And she can't.

09:47.350 --> 09:51.639
So are we really saying
that Alison's "A" out loud?

09:56.790 --> 09:57.859
She never loved me.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.591
She never loved
any of us.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.590
Guys,
if Mona's right,

10:04.700 --> 10:07.362
if Ali is ending the game
because we cut her off,

10:07.470 --> 10:09.097
then she went to the cops
to convince them

10:09.200 --> 10:10.906
that she's innocent
and we're the gle ones.

10:11.010 --> 10:11.999
Guilty of what?

10:12.110 --> 10:13.134
Everything.

10:14.810 --> 10:17.005
Look, I can find out
what she told the cops.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.271
Maybe it'll give you
guys a fighting chance

10:19.380 --> 10:20.847
to get
your stories straight.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.317
Mona,
why are you helping us?

10:25.290 --> 10:28.782
I got early acceptance letters
from three colleges,

10:28.890 --> 10:31.859
but_I still have
to survwe senior year.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.291
And I can't do it alone.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.799
We need
your help, Mona,

10:34.900 --> 10:37.118
but this doesn't
suddenly make us besties.

10:37.230 --> 10:40.631
I don't want to hold your hand
in the hallways, Emily.

10:40.740 --> 10:41.832
No one can know
that I'm doing this

10:41.940 --> 10:43.669
or the deal is off.

10:43.770 --> 10:45.738
And that includes
your bed-buddies.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.875
Okay?

10:48.140 --> 10:49.869
So do whatever you
were going to do today.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.039
Just act normal.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.681
Hey, Toodles.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.143
Happy almost-Turkey Day.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.922
( bell ringing )

11:13.270 --> 11:14.737
Thanks.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.333
You ready
for Thanksgiving?

11:17.440 --> 11:19.032
Uh, not really, no.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.108
Because we usually decorate
early for Christmas

11:21.210 --> 11:23.075
and this year,
I'm totally behind.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.008
If you need
any help...

11:28.820 --> 11:31.209
How was your night, the one
you got all dressed up for?

11:33.490 --> 11:35.958
It was a costume thing.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.186
Mine didn't really fit.

11:41.330 --> 11:42.820
We never had our talk.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.692
I'm tired of talking.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.008
Mom?

12:09.120 --> 12:10.087
What are you doing here?

12:12.130 --> 12:13.449
I was just
in the cafeteria

12:13.560 --> 12:15.994
dropping off the food
for the holiday drive.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.829
You forgot to bring
the bag this morning.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.388
Sorry, my brain's already
on Thanksgiving break.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.001
It's no big deal.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.202
( bell ringing )

12:24.310 --> 12:25.868
Don't be late
for class, honey.

12:25.970 --> 12:26.868
I'll see you tonight.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.969
Yeah.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.817
ASSISTANT: ( on intercom )
Alison DiLaurentis,

12:38.920 --> 12:40.979
please report
to Principal Hackett's office.

12:41.090 --> 12:44.150
Alison DiLaurentis,
please report to the principal.

12:57.970 --> 12:59.403
You've got pumpkin
guts on your face.

12:59.510 --> 13:00.431
Oh.

13:02.380 --> 13:03.369
Come here.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.249
Thank you.

13:09.850 --> 13:12.444
You know, we can just go
to Paula's and buy the pies.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.188
No, this is
my grandmother's recipe.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.019
This is way better
than Paula's.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.224
Granny Rose uses
Libby's canned pie mix

13:18.330 --> 13:19.786
and puts it
in a frozen shell,

13:19.900 --> 13:21.197
but Montgomerys will
never know the difference.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.325
Well, this is the first time
the Montgomerys

13:23.430 --> 13:25.421
have invited me
over for Thanksgiving

13:25.530 --> 13:28.033
and your mother
assigned me with pie duty.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.198
So I'm not
taking it lightly.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.858
Well, just
so you know,

13:30.970 --> 13:32.335
they're not gonna have enough
time to judge your baking.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.509
They'll be too busy
judging you.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.341
Well, that's why
you're invited.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.839
They know that we're spending
a lot of time together,

13:40.950 --> 13:42.076
so they just want
to make sure

13:42.180 --> 13:43.147
that you're worth
a second look.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.808
Wow.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.980
I'm suddenly feeling
like a used car.

13:48.090 --> 13:50.251
Are they going to kick my tires
and check under my hood?

13:50.360 --> 13:51.827
Well, if Aunt Sarah
gets drunk,

13:51.930 --> 13:53.158
she might check
under your hood.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.251
And Uncle Danny will
ask you to arm wrestle.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.998
Just say no.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.465
You're gonna love
granny, though.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.365
You won't mind
that she toots a lot.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.407
I'm joking.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.102
Granny plucks
her chin hairs.

14:08.210 --> 14:11.839
* We are how we treat
each other and nothing more *

14:13.350 --> 14:17.184
* To be bold,
to be brave *

14:18.920 --> 14:24.278
* It is the thinking that
the heart can still be saved *

14:24.390 --> 14:27.257
* And the darkness
can come qUIck *

14:29.330 --> 14:31.195
TOBY: Put your hands behind
your head and turn around.

14:36.140 --> 14:38.529
I said put your hands
behind your head.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.400
I'm sorry, Officer,

14:45.510 --> 14:48.013
I have a difficult time
with authority.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.417
If you want me to put
my hands behind my head,

14:49.520 --> 14:52.512
you're gonna have
to come over here and make me.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.884
Are you looking
for trouble?

14:54.990 --> 14:56.480
No, sir.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.080
I'm a good girl,
honest.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.455
I just have a lot
of really bad habits.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.164
Oh, yeah.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.362
They taught us
how to deal

15:04.470 --> 15:06.893
with delinquents
like you in the Academy.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.399
Why don't you show me
what you learned?

15:19.610 --> 15:21.168
That is some cop school.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.441
You'll see it tonight.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.347
The ceremony
starts at 8:00,

15:26.450 --> 15:28.918
but I think we should
leave the Brew by 7:00.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.385
I'll be on time,
I promise.

15:33.660 --> 15:35.127
Happy graduation.

15:39.330 --> 15:40.433
Open it.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.038
Go ahead,
open it.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.943
Spence.

16:00.490 --> 16:01.559
I love you.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.537
Hi.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.039
Sorry to bother you.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.277
Is this
where I apply

16:20.380 --> 16:21.506
for the high school
liaison program?

16:21.610 --> 16:23.248
Oh, yeah.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.500
Have a seat.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.542
I'll get you
an application.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.738
( beeping )

17:52.600 --> 17:55.330
I don't think she meant we
had to decorate your house.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.806
This is the one thing
I do every year

17:57.910 --> 17:59.366
for me
and my family.

17:59.470 --> 18:01.472
I'm not gonna let Ali
take that away from me.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.604
Eggnog?

18:02.710 --> 18:04.075
No, thanks.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.744
If you can't find Christmas
in your heart, Hanna,

18:07.850 --> 18:09.511
you're not gonna
find it under a tree.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.509
Hey, Em,
is this right?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.522
( sighs )

18:18.630 --> 18:21.155
A little more
to the right.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.125
No, my right,
not Snowey's right.

18:23.230 --> 18:24.367
Snowey?

18:24.470 --> 18:27.234
Yeah, I named him
when I was three.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.490
And this is Pingey
and Wingey.

18:31.570 --> 18:32.707
Which one did
you touch?

18:32.810 --> 18:34.368
All of them,
I don't know.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.799
Oh, try one
of the red ones.

18:35.910 --> 18:36.831
They always go out.

18:39.350 --> 18:40.612
Told you.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.711
Now let's deck the halls
and fa la la la la.

18:44.850 --> 18:46.340
What is wrong
with her?

18:46.450 --> 18:48.111
Read her boobs.

18:48.220 --> 18:49.209
The girl
loves Christmas.

18:51.390 --> 18:52.857
Where's Jesus?

18:54.560 --> 18:56.596
He's up here.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.395
Oh.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.398
( cell phone ringing )

19:02.770 --> 19:03.759
It's my mom.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.809
You guys
really go all out.

19:13.450 --> 19:16.419
My dad always finds a way
to come home for Christmas.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.647
It's after Thanksgiving dinner
my mom and I come outside,

19:18.750 --> 19:19.910
turn on the lights

19:20.020 --> 19:21.612
and we know it won'_t be
long until we see him.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.828
Well, now I know why
you love Christmas.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.495
Yep.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.668
Uh, how's everything
at home?

19:32.770 --> 19:33.759
Good.

19:33.870 --> 19:35.337
She just needs
cranberries.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.589
They were on the list.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.201
They should be
in the fridge.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.631
Yeah, I know, but my grandma
likes the canned kind.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.503
You know, the ones
that you slice.

19:42.610 --> 19:44.578
I thought your grandma
always made that salad

19:44.680 --> 19:46.409
with the cranberries
and the marshmallows in it.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.578
Or not.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.284
Hey, Em, can you
grab a staple gun

19:51.390 --> 19:52.311
and give me a hand?

19:54.790 --> 19:56.553
Okay, what was that?

19:56.660 --> 19:58.218
What was what?

19:58.330 --> 20:00.389
Hanna, I know when
you're lying to me.

20:03.730 --> 20:06.460
EXAMINER: Who else was
in the barn that night?

20:06.570 --> 20:09.391
ALISON: Aria Montgomery.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.432
Hanna Marin.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.906
And Emily Fields.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.375
EXAMINER: When
you left the barn,

20:14.480 --> 20:15.606
they were
all still sleeping?

20:15.710 --> 20:16.904
Yes.

20:17.010 --> 20:20.446
EXAMINER: Where did you
last see Spencer Hastings?

20:21.550 --> 20:23.279
She came to my house.

20:26.490 --> 20:29.357
EXAMINER: You were
the leader of the group, right?

20:29.460 --> 20:30.984
Unofficially.

20:31.090 --> 20:32.489
EXAMINER:
And your friends

20:33.600 --> 20:35.522
would have done
anything to help you?

20:35.630 --> 20:37.427
If you needed them?

20:38.870 --> 20:40.394
I think so.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.230
EXAMINER: _
Was Spencer a loyal friend?

20:43.340 --> 20:45.228
As far as I knew.

20:45.340 --> 20:46.739
EXAMINER:
Why was she at your house?

20:51.680 --> 20:54.444
It was my fault.

20:54.550 --> 20:56.609
I pushed her
to that place.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.641
EXAMINER: What place?

20:59.650 --> 21:01.652
She was angry.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.627
EXAMINER: Did you know Spencer
was abusing amphetamines?

21:04.730 --> 21:06.425
I found out that night.

21:06.530 --> 21:09.624
EXAMINER: Because she
was under the influence?

21:09.730 --> 21:12.324
She dropped her pills.

21:12.430 --> 21:14.796
I saw what they were.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.802
EXAMINER: Would you
say she was desperate?

21:18.910 --> 21:20.400
For what?

21:20.510 --> 21:22.671
EXAMINER:
For you to keep her secret?

21:22.780 --> 21:26.341
She was emotional.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.315
But I promised her
I wouldn't say anything.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.786
EXAMINER: And in return
for your silence,

21:32.890 --> 21:34.653
what was she
Willing to do?

21:34.760 --> 21:36.978
I wouldn't know.

21:37.090 --> 21:39.684
_ We never _
discussed it again.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.929
EXAMINER: Is there something
else you'd like to tell me?

21:50.470 --> 21:53.576
I didn't have anything to do
with Bethany Young's murder.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.701
( doorbell rings )

22:01.620 --> 22:02.939
Do you play?

22:03.050 --> 22:04.449
Sorry?

22:04.550 --> 22:05.448
The piano?

22:05.550 --> 22:06.744
Oh.

22:06.850 --> 22:10.854
Um, I loved it as a kid,
but I lost interest.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.427
I can't remember why.

22:13.900 --> 22:17.097
I shouldn't be here
without Lieutenant Tanner,

22:17.200 --> 22:19.862
but I just wanted
to tell you this in person.

22:21.540 --> 22:22.859
What is it?

22:29.110 --> 22:32.045
Nothing Ali said was
really that incriminating.

22:32.150 --> 22:33.879
I think the questions
they're asking

22:33.980 --> 22:35.447
tell _us more about
their investigation

22:35.550 --> 22:36.619
than her answers do.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.744
How so?

22:37.850 --> 22:39.340
Was Spencer
a loyal friend?

22:39.450 --> 22:40.485
Was she desperate?

22:40.590 --> 22:41.614
Desperate enough
to do what?

22:41.720 --> 22:42.618
( door opens )

22:42.720 --> 22:44.358
Kill Bethany.

22:44.460 --> 22:46.348
Caleb, you are supposed
to keep that secret.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.052
Mona came to me.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.492
I knew you'd tell him,
so I asked for his help.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.092
Are there any other
helpers coming?

22:53.200 --> 22:54.599
No, I didn't tell
my bed-buddy.

22:54.700 --> 22:55.632
Neither did I.

22:55.740 --> 22:56.764
I'm sorry.

22:56.870 --> 22:58.360
But could you
lie to that face?

23:00.140 --> 23:01.903
I unlocked
two more files.

23:02.010 --> 23:04.376
Your software
slays by the way.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.902
Is that decoding
program military?

23:06.010 --> 23:07.375
You don't
want to know.

23:08.850 --> 23:10.112
The cops were
granted access

23:10.220 --> 23:12.017
to Bethany's Radley
files yesterday.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.678
I can't open
that link,

23:13.790 --> 23:15.519
but I did find
this affidavit

23:15.620 --> 23:17.156
that Holbrook sent
to the DA today.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.649
"We no longer consider
Alison DiLaurentis

23:19.760 --> 23:23.491
a person of interest in
Young's murder investigation."

23:23.600 --> 23:25.158
So she's totally
off the hook?

23:25.270 --> 23:27.659
Yeah,
and Spencer's on it.

23:27.770 --> 23:28.862
"The information
we obtained

23:28.970 --> 23:30.631
from Bethany Young's
hospital records

23:30.740 --> 23:33.038
inform the theory we've
been working since day one.

23:33.140 --> 23:36.928
Spencer Hastings murdered
Young to gain favor

23:37.040 --> 23:39.008
with the group's leader,
Alison."

23:39.110 --> 23:42.739
But why would killing Bethany
score points with Ali?

23:42.850 --> 23:45.080
She told them she knew
that I was taking the pills.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.942
So they think that I would
have done anything

23:47.050 --> 23:48.688
to make her
keep it a secret.

23:48.790 --> 23:51.122
Yeah, but why would they think
that she wanted Bethany dead?

23:51.230 --> 23:53.619
You said he sent
this to the DA?

23:53.730 --> 23:55.129
Guys, I know
how this works.

23:55.230 --> 23:56.527
They submit
an affidavit

23:56.630 --> 23:57.562
so they can issue
an arrest warrant.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.569
Can you please
call Toby?

24:00.670 --> 24:01.659
I have to find
my parents.

24:01.770 --> 24:02.930
Before you do that,

24:03.040 --> 24:04.598
don't you want to know
what the cops know?

24:04.710 --> 24:06.564
That affidavit
was sent the day

24:06.670 --> 24:08.877
after they saw
Bethany's Radley files.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.004
There has to be
something in those files

24:10.110 --> 24:11.577
that linked Ali
to Bethany.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.840
Let's find out
what that is.

24:12.950 --> 24:14.577
You guys,
this is on me.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.443
You don't have
to do anything else.

24:16.550 --> 24:18.211
Come on, Spence.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.947
We're gonna
stick together.

24:20.050 --> 24:21.711
Yeah, because
that's what we do.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.228
Let's go back
to Radley.

24:35.270 --> 24:36.464
Together.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.709
Are you in?

24:54.890 --> 24:56.653
We're in.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.751
Code "go".

24:58.860 --> 25:00.487
I repeat,
code "go".

25:01.330 --> 25:02.524
( beeping )

25:16.010 --> 25:17.671
( cell phone beeps )

25:17.780 --> 25:18.974
Emily hasn't
checked in.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.514
You better make sure
that's not from "A".

25:21.620 --> 25:22.644
You mean Alison.

25:25.220 --> 25:26.642
It's Toby.

25:26.750 --> 25:27.910
I should have told him
what we were doing.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.556
Not to poke
where I don't belong,

25:29.660 --> 25:31.787
but if I were graduating
from po-po school,

25:31.890 --> 25:33.050
I wouldn't want to know
that my girlfriend

25:33.160 --> 25:34.525
just broke
into Radley.

25:34.630 --> 25:36.791
I have to make it
to that ceremony.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.219
Then let's stop
chatting and HTHU.

25:38.330 --> 25:40.025
Okay.

25:40.130 --> 25:43.190
We're in _the east corri_dor hall
approaching the security door.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.733
( buzzes )

25:48.780 --> 25:49.804
I'm sure it's nothing.

25:49.910 --> 25:52.549
Just a scratchy throat.

25:52.650 --> 25:54.675
But I was just about
to crawl into bed, so...

25:57.120 --> 25:59.088
I will.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.316
Thanks, Paige.

26:01.720 --> 26:02.755
Emily.

26:04.090 --> 26:06.684
I didn't mean
to scare you.

26:06.790 --> 26:09.156
No, you didn't.

26:09.260 --> 26:12.593
I seriously saw the hair
rise on the back of your neck

26:12.700 --> 26:13.837
when you heard
my voice.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.968
I was surprised
to get your message.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.331
You made
your feelings for me

26:22.440 --> 26:24.146
crystal the last time
I saw you.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.171
( phone beeps )

26:27.410 --> 26:29.970
Sorry, my mom
is at the store.

26:32.190 --> 26:33.316
Last minute shopping.

26:39.090 --> 26:40.990
Why am I here, Emily?

26:43.130 --> 26:44.768
It bothers me.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.964
I mean tomorrow's Thanksgiving
and you and I aren't speaking.

26:48.070 --> 26:51.130
I wasn't that surprised
when the others turned on me.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.901
You were the one
I really trusted.

26:53.010 --> 26:54.238
The loyal one.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.269
What?

26:57.380 --> 26:58.779
Nothing.

27:00.050 --> 27:01.347
I'm sorry
I disappointed you.

27:02.750 --> 27:06.379
Ali, wait.

27:06.490 --> 27:08.981
I don't want things
to be like this.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.019
Neither do I.

27:21.970 --> 27:23.335
Wow,
that's beautiful, Sandy.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.101
I love the colors
that you chose.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.826
Oh, God.

27:44.860 --> 27:45.929
I'm so sorry.

27:46.030 --> 27:47.224
This was totally
all my fault.

27:47.330 --> 27:49.719
Wow.

27:49.830 --> 27:51.991
Yeah, my middle name
should have been Klutz.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.796
And can you believe

27:55.900 --> 27:57.709
I actually wanted
to be a dancer growing up?

27:57.810 --> 28:01.268
But then I realized
I was on the shorter side,

28:01.380 --> 28:03.200
_so career
Cl'lSlS averted.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.872
Hey, I'm sorry.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.997
Holy crap.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.260
We've got company.

28:27.370 --> 28:29.099
MONA: H, use
your codes please.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.929
Seriously?

28:31.040 --> 28:33.099
Okay, red-light.
Do you hear me?

28:37.780 --> 28:39.270
We're in.

28:39.380 --> 28:43.111
I said red-light as in
the cherry on top of a cop car.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.454
You've made quite
a mess of things.

29:00.330 --> 29:01.934
I didn't know
you worked here, Aria.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.131
It's not a job.

29:05.240 --> 29:06.207
I volunteer.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.277
Okay, well, I should probably
get back to the patients.

29:11.380 --> 29:12.278
They might need
more supplies.

29:12.380 --> 29:13.278
Yeah, of course.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.416
I'm just curious.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.839
When did it all start?

29:16.950 --> 29:19.248
What?

29:19.350 --> 29:20.282
The lies.

29:20.390 --> 29:21.789
The cover-ups.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.016
The murders.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.120
Your volunteer program.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.397
Oh, a few weeks ago.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.889
Do you have an interest in
the mental health profession?

29:35.170 --> 29:37.832
Well, I love art,
I love helping people.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.305
And did you
volunteer before

29:39.410 --> 29:42.299
or after the police
identified Bethany's body?

29:43.880 --> 29:45.507
Okay, you don't sound
just curious anymore.

29:45.610 --> 29:46.907
Should I call
my parents?

29:47.010 --> 29:49.114
No.
Not yet.

29:50.180 --> 29:53.240
Oh, one last thing.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.057
Was your volunteer work
Spenceﬂsidea?

29:56.160 --> 29:57.309
No.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.368
Em, it's me.

30:09.470 --> 30:11.108
I mean, "H".

30:11.210 --> 30:12.507
Is she still there?

30:12.610 --> 30:14.805
Because Holbrook's here
and it's getting weird.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.848
What is this?

30:18.950 --> 30:20.144
That?

30:20.250 --> 30:21.512
Stop stalling.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.942
Well, obviously
it's a list of colleges.

30:25.050 --> 30:27.245
Right, but this
is a list of schools

30:27.350 --> 30:29.215
that normally
brainiacs go to.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.356
Yeah, so?

30:31.460 --> 30:33.951
You know that test
they make you take?

30:34.060 --> 30:35.254
The SCT?

30:35.360 --> 30:37.055
You mean the SAT?

30:37.160 --> 30:38.297
I don't remember
which one it was.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.095
But apparently I did
kind of good on it.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.998
Well, how good
is kind of good?

30:43.100 --> 30:44.408
Good enough that
the guidance counselor

30:44.510 --> 30:45.863
called me in
for cheating.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.835
But I didn't cheat.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.472
There's no way they're going
to let you be friends with me.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.138
If that's what
you want.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.945
I make my own decisions.

31:00.050 --> 31:02.610
It's not a group vote.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.381
I've had
the chills all day.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.526
Do you have any tea?

31:06.630 --> 31:07.892
Chamomile?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.537
Your mom never shops
at the last minute.

31:19.270 --> 31:21.033
You've got a text
from Hanna.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.074
She wants to know if you're
still keeping me busy.

31:23.180 --> 31:26.001
I'm "A," right?

31:26.110 --> 31:28.044
I don't know.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.071
Are you?

31:38.660 --> 31:40.582
I actually
believed you.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.420
It must hurt when
the loyal one betrays you.

31:49.700 --> 31:53.033
That was quite
a performance, Em.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.038
Bravo.

32:54.070 --> 32:55.230
It looks like
they've recorded

32:55.340 --> 32:58.730
every one
of Bethany's sessions.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.138
So what_ are
your ch0ices?

33:03.580 --> 33:05.548
Yale, Harvard,
and Dartmouth.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.016
You got early acceptance
from all three?

33:08.120 --> 33:09.473
Brown, too,

33:09.580 --> 33:12.583
but they're not offering me
a full ride, so I'm passing.

33:12.690 --> 33:13.714
How about you?

33:13.820 --> 33:16.288
I haven't heard
from anyone yet.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.620
Oh, well, if there's
anything I can do to help--

33:18.730 --> 33:20.049
I think you've
done enough.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.136
Wait, are we
stealing this stuff?

33:29.200 --> 33:30.189
We're borrowing it.

33:31.770 --> 33:33.431
Wait.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.679
See if there is a tape
for August 8th?

33:45.750 --> 33:47.638
BETHANY: Ithought
she really liked me.

33:47.750 --> 33:49.786
But everything she ever
said to me was a lie.

33:49.890 --> 33:51.289
MONA: Who is she
talking about?

33:51.390 --> 33:52.687
BETHANY: Every word.

33:52.790 --> 33:54.326
Every visit.

33:54.430 --> 33:55.419
Mrs. DiLaurentis.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.561
She was having an affair
with Bethany's father.

34:01.770 --> 34:04.568
BETHANY: Iwonder if I can
trust anyone in that family.

34:04.670 --> 34:07.161
Is it like mother,
like daughter?

34:07.270 --> 34:08.578
Oh, my God.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.204
Did Alison
know Bethany?

34:13.180 --> 34:14.477
Spencer, it's me.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.309
I can't wait any longer,
so I'm gonna head out.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.318
Call me.

34:20.190 --> 34:21.748
MONA: We need to find
another way out of here.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.259
HANNA: Use
the back staircase.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.622
We can trip
the emergency exit.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.688
What's Holbrook
doing here?

34:31.800 --> 34:33.324
Asking questions
about Spencer.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.062
( buzzes )

34:40.410 --> 34:41.775
Toby, hi.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.348
Spencer,
where are you?

34:44.450 --> 34:45.508
I was worried about you.

34:45.610 --> 34:47.840
Wait,
I can't hear you.

34:47.950 --> 34:48.848
Hello?

34:48.950 --> 34:50.076
Spencer?

34:51.350 --> 34:52.749
Spencer?
I can't hear you .

34:52.850 --> 34:53.748
( horn honking )

34:53.850 --> 34:54.782
( tires screeching )

34:55.820 --> 34:57.117
Toby!

35:06.670 --> 35:08.661
I can't believe they make you
work on Thanksgiving.

35:08.770 --> 35:09.794
I get off at noon.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.606
People still
need their fix.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.631
Thanks.

35:14.210 --> 35:16.701
Spencer,
it's not your fault.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.243
Were you
at the hospital all night?

35:18.350 --> 35:19.601
Yeah.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.849
He's going to be fine.
You said so yourself.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.815
He's gonna be in that cast
for about a month.

35:29.190 --> 35:30.612
How much
does he know?

35:30.720 --> 35:32.221
Everything.

35:32.330 --> 35:35.254
Emily, I have
to talk to you.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.692
Um, Paige, I'm sorry,
now is not a good time.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.119
I brought you
some soup last night

35:39.230 --> 35:40.162
because you said
you weren't feeling well.

35:40.270 --> 35:41.362
Yeah,
and I lied because--

35:41.470 --> 35:42.732
Explain it to me later.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.138
I saw Alison leaving.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.707
Cindy and Mindy
were her ride.

35:46.810 --> 35:49.176
They drove her out
to this abandoned farm.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.544
There had to have been at least
a dozen cars out there.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.709
Guys, Ali is building
an army of her own.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.643
Spencer Hastings,
you're under arrest

35:59.750 --> 36:00.682
for the murder
of Bethany Young.

36:00.790 --> 36:03.509
No.
I-I-I didn't do this.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.518
Toby!

36:04.630 --> 36:07.190
( cross talk)

36:07.290 --> 36:08.826
...will be admissible
in a court of law.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.295
She didn't do anything!

36:10.400 --> 36:11.719
Guys!
Spencer!

36:11.830 --> 36:12.819
Toby.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.898
I'll call your parents.
We'll get you out.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.437
BETHANY: Ithought
she really liked me.

36:19.540 --> 36:21.929
But everything she ever
said to me was a lie.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.701
LEONA: Mona?

36:23.810 --> 36:25.175
I'll be right down.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.674
( cell phone chimes )

36:37.860 --> 36:40.385
Oh, and did I tell you
Lesli's gonna be there?

36:40.490 --> 36:41.821
No way.
I talked to her last night.

36:41.930 --> 36:44.228
She said she was
stuck at school.

36:44.330 --> 36:46.195
Pretend I didn't
just ruin the surprise.

36:47.730 --> 36:49.766
Promise me you'll get
on the road within the hour.

36:49.870 --> 36:50.837
I don't want you
to get stuck in traffic.

36:50.940 --> 36:52.237
Okay, I will.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.261
I just have
to finish this report

36:53.370 --> 36:54.405
and then
I'm on my way.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.571
I know we don't
need these.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.286
But I figured someone
might get hungry.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.415
My mom's still on
the phone with Veronica.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.589
They haven't
seen her yet.

37:44.690 --> 37:45.782
Spencer's still
getting processed.

37:45.890 --> 37:49.894
Look, I'm sure that the Hastings
are working on her bail.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.321
They'll get her out
of there in no time, Aria.

37:52.430 --> 37:55.536
( cell phone ringing )

37:55.640 --> 37:56.789
It's Mona.

37:56.900 --> 37:57.969
Hello.

37:58.070 --> 38:00.300
Alison lured Bethany
to Rosewood.

38:00.410 --> 38:01.672
What? Why?

38:01.780 --> 38:02.735
She knew about the affair.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.034
Alison set her up.

38:04.140 --> 38:06.347
She was jealous and
she wanted Bethany dead.

38:39.910 --> 38:43.073
Aria, Alison is "A"
and now I can prove it.

38:44.390 --> 38:45.414
Grab your coat.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.441
Where are we going?

38:46.550 --> 38:48.040
To Mona's.
She found proof.

38:48.150 --> 38:49.082
Ali's "A".

38:55.600 --> 38:57.659
Game over, Alison.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.988
I win.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.989
( floorboard creaks )

39:02.100 --> 39:03.362
Mom?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.069
( gasps )

39:13.110 --> 39:14.475
Mona?

39:14.580 --> 39:16.810
What the hell?

39:18.750 --> 39:20.342
Oh, my God.

39:20.450 --> 39:21.917
Mona!

39:26.160 --> 39:29.129
( shrieking )

39:32.430 --> 39:37.788
* In this dirty
old part of the city *

39:37.900 --> 39:42.530
* Where the_sun
refused to shine *

39:42.640 --> 39:48.875
* People tell me there
ain't no use in trying *

39:52.190 --> 39:57.617
* Now, my girl, you're
so young and pretty *

39:57.720 --> 40:00.689
* And one thing
I know is true *

40:00.790 --> 40:03.099
The investigation
is ongoing,

40:03.200 --> 40:05.418
but we have ruled
this a homicide.

40:06.970 --> 40:08.790
Although we did
not find a body,

40:08.900 --> 40:11.039
the amount of blood
in the house would indicate

40:11.140 --> 40:12.505
that the victim's
wounds were fatal.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.435
Mona Vanderwaal
was murdered.

40:22.980 --> 40:26.689
* We got to get out
of this place *

40:26.790 --> 40:33.423
* 'Cause there's a better life
for me and you *

40:35.800 --> 40:38.462
* For me and you

40:43.100 --> 40:48.106
* Watch my daddy
in bed a-dying *

40:48.210 --> 40:53.102
* Watched his hair been
turning grey, yeah *

40:53.210 --> 40:58.842
* He's been working
and slaving his life away *

41:03.120 --> 41:08.649
* He's been
working so hard *

41:08.760 --> 41:13.220
* I've been working
so hard *

41:13.330 --> 41:16.868
* I've been working
so hard *

41:16.970 --> 41:19.461
* Want to get away

41:19.570 --> 41:20.867
* Want to get away

41:20.970 --> 41:22.130
* Get away

41:23.610 --> 41:27.478
* We got to get out
of this place *

41:27.580 --> 41:32.483
* If it's the last thing
we ever do *

41:33.750 --> 41:37.186
* We got to get out
of this place *

41:37.290 --> 41:44.253
* 'Cause there's a better life
for me and you *

41:46.630 --> 41:49.235
* For me and you
