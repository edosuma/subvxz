-Left arm.

10:44.689 --> 10:46.517
Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay, got you.

10:46.551 --> 10:47.896
Listen, just relax now.
Just relax.

10:47.931 --> 10:49.379
We'’re just gonna be
safe for ourselves, okay?

10:49.413 --> 10:52.655
You got a holster
and a magazine on you,
all right?

10:52.689 --> 10:55.034
Left arm, come around easy.
-What'’s your name?

10:55.068 --> 10:57.034
-I refuse to answer
any questions.

10:57.068 --> 10:58.482
-Is he male or female?

10:58.517 --> 11:00.241
-Clear the air.

11:00.275 --> 11:04.000
The suspect had a holster
on his waist.

11:04.034 --> 11:06.931
And then, when they
extricated him from the car,

11:06.965 --> 11:09.310
an extra magazine
fell out on the ground,

11:09.344 --> 11:11.413
along with his knife
and everything.

11:11.448 --> 11:15.413
The gun is in the car
on the driver'’s side floorboard.

11:15.448 --> 11:17.689
He'’s been known
to carry guns.

11:17.724 --> 11:22.517
Every time we'’ve had contact
with him, we'’ve had to deal with
a gun of some sort.

11:23.758 --> 11:26.137
-Explain to me why
you shot my vehicle.

11:26.172 --> 11:28.586
-Why I shot your vehicle?
-Yeah.

11:28.620 --> 11:32.275
-Well, at the end
of an incident like this,
we can'’t just walk up

11:32.310 --> 11:34.241
and talk to you
like a normal car stop.

11:34.275 --> 11:36.034
We were tellin'’ you
to get outta the car,

11:36.068 --> 11:37.517
and we told you
that things were gonna
happen.

11:37.551 --> 11:41.655
-Did you not hear me
that I was on the phone
with my therapist?

11:41.689 --> 11:45.551
-Well, you can be
on the phone...
-And-- And my-- my attorney.

11:45.586 --> 11:49.655
-Okay.
-And you chose to shot--
to shoot at me anyway.

11:49.689 --> 11:52.931
-I did shoot beanbags
at you because you weren'’t
doin'’ what you were told.

11:52.965 --> 11:56.034
-Sir, you shot
projectiles at me.

11:56.068 --> 11:59.137
-I actually shot two projectiles
through your back window,

11:59.172 --> 12:02.172
and then one through
the front window, when
you reached down under the seat.

12:02.206 --> 12:04.862
Why didn'’t you just
climb out of the car for us?

12:06.448 --> 12:09.413
-I didn'’t wanna get hurt...
-You didn'’t wanna
get hurt?

12:09.448 --> 12:11.551
-Did you think that
if we were gonna
shoot at you

12:11.586 --> 12:15.034
if you were in the car,
that you wouldn'’t get hurt
by stayin'’ in there?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.965
Or do you think maybe
it would'’ve been a better idea

12:17.000 --> 12:22.586
to-- to get outta the car
and start doin'’ what we
were askin'’ you to do?

12:22.620 --> 12:26.586
-I wasn'’t sure that'd
screw things up
with the attorney.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.310
-Well, we weren'’t really
askin'’ you any questions.

12:29.344 --> 12:31.068
We were kinda tellin'’ you
what to do at that point.

12:31.103 --> 12:35.655
-Okay, well, I wanna know
why I was pulled over.

12:35.689 --> 12:38.896
-I believe you-- the tag
on your BMW is expired.

12:38.931 --> 12:40.724
That'’s what came over
the radio.

12:40.758 --> 12:44.172
-The tag on my BMW
has expired.

12:44.206 --> 12:45.517
-Yes, ma'’am.

12:45.551 --> 12:47.275
Do me a favor,
swing your feet in.

12:47.310 --> 12:50.517
Okay?
Watch your knees,
'’cause sometimes those cages

12:50.551 --> 12:52.000
are a little cramped.

12:52.034 --> 12:53.241
-I'’m sorry.

12:53.275 --> 12:55.586
-West-- I was westbound,
this guy passed me...

12:55.620 --> 12:58.241
fast enough, so that
when I came up
and I saw him

12:58.275 --> 13:00.758
in the corner of my eye,
I was like, "Holy cow,
I'’m about to get hit."

13:00.793 --> 13:03.551
I sped up and got the tag number
and ran the tag.

13:03.586 --> 13:06.689
The tag came back expired,
like I said, so I called it in,

13:06.724 --> 13:08.896
and I turned my lights on
and it took off.

13:08.931 --> 13:12.965
We were chasin'’ him
at various speeds, uh,
all over northwest Wichita.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.655
Got him spiked twice,
and that'’s when he started
havin'’ a whole lotta trouble

13:16.689 --> 13:18.517
maintaining control
and then slowed down.

13:18.551 --> 13:20.793
Luckily, came to an end here.

13:20.827 --> 13:22.206
I'’m still lookin'
at all the charges,

13:22.241 --> 13:24.931
but at least have the felony,
flee and elude.

13:24.965 --> 13:27.482
-Well, thanks for addin'’
a little excitement
to our evening.

13:29.586 --> 13:31.137
-I'’ve been
with the, uh,
Sheriff'’s Department

13:31.172 --> 13:33.586
for comin'’ up
about nine and a half years.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.931
Had my own business
prior to doin'’ this.

13:35.965 --> 13:38.034
Always wanted to be
a deputy for Pierce County,

13:38.068 --> 13:41.000
and I decided, now'’s the time,
before I get too old to do this.

13:41.034 --> 13:44.448
And, uh, I grew up here.
It'’s kinda fun, to, uh,

13:44.482 --> 13:47.689
work for the Department
I'’ve always wanted
to work for, and uh,

13:47.724 --> 13:49.689
do what I'’ve always
wanted to do.

13:49.724 --> 13:51.965
We'’re going
to an unwanted person.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.137
Female'’s callin' and sayin'’
her ex-boyfriend is outside,
knocking on her door.

13:57.172 --> 14:00.758
He'’s been harassin' her
by phone all day,

14:00.793 --> 14:03.689
accusin'’ her of takin'
some items.

14:03.724 --> 14:07.724
It looks like my partner,
Deputy Jarvis, is making contact
with the male half.

14:07.758 --> 14:08.965
I'’ll go talk to her.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.379
See what we got.

14:14.827 --> 14:16.758
Hello!
Sheriff'’s Department.

14:16.793 --> 14:18.551
My partner'’s talking to him.
-Okay.

14:18.586 --> 14:20.862
You wanna come in?
I just don'’t wanna be
out there with him.

14:20.896 --> 14:23.241
-Yep, yep...
so... what'’s goin' on tonight?

14:23.275 --> 14:26.689
-He'’s been harassing me
all day because I found
some stuff that--

14:26.724 --> 14:28.275
he'’s basically lashing out.

14:28.310 --> 14:31.413
And he'’s been harassing me
since, like, two o'’clock today.

14:31.448 --> 14:33.896
-Okay, like,
how harassing... texting?

14:33.931 --> 14:35.689
-I have-- Texting.
-Okay, what'’s he sayin'?

14:35.724 --> 14:39.551
-He'’s saying, um, that
I took his laptop

14:39.586 --> 14:41.068
and his watch,
and I don'’t have it.

14:41.103 --> 14:43.000
-You don'’t have either one?
-I don'’t have either one.
My-- My--

14:43.034 --> 14:45.172
-Do you have any tool--
tools of his?
-I gave him his box.

14:45.206 --> 14:46.551
-How long you guys
been dating?

14:46.586 --> 14:49.931
-A year and a half now...
a year and a half.
-Year and a half.

14:49.965 --> 14:52.241
Okay, are you guys split up?
-Split up, today--

14:52.275 --> 14:54.517
-He doesn'’t live here?
-I-- Yeah.
He doesn'’t live here...

14:54.551 --> 14:56.482
-Did he ever live here?
-No, he doesn'’t.

14:56.517 --> 14:59.172
-N-- He never did?
-No, I lived at his place.

14:59.206 --> 15:01.448
-Oh, you lived at his place.
-For just the summer.

15:01.482 --> 15:05.068
-Okay.
-So my thing is that,
he'’s saying, we went to Costco

15:05.103 --> 15:07.448
probably like two days ago,
and we all went shopping,
-Mm-hm.

15:07.482 --> 15:12.206
-me and my brother
that'’s inside... and everything
came up to be 400.

15:12.241 --> 15:14.724
And then he said,
okay, just to put everything
on his card.

15:14.758 --> 15:18.206
And which there was
two register ladies
that I can go and--

15:18.241 --> 15:21.000
you know, ask them,
was he there, did he say yes?

15:21.034 --> 15:24.517
And he did.
But then he took off,
and then I had to sign.

15:24.551 --> 15:28.172
-Okay.
Well, we-- We don'’t dispute
the money part of it'’s okay,

15:28.206 --> 15:30.310
-but...
-Well, what am I supposed
to do with that if he wants to--

15:30.344 --> 15:33.068
that'’s what he's threatening me
to do, and I don'’t--

15:33.103 --> 15:35.931
-Yeah.
No, all-- all we'’re doin'
is here because you called,

15:35.965 --> 15:37.896
-Yeah, I call...
-you said he was--
you wanted him to leave,

15:37.931 --> 15:40.793
right, basically?
-I want him to leave,
and he'’s saying I have his--

15:40.827 --> 15:43.827
I don'’t have his stuff--
He wants food or something?

15:43.862 --> 15:46.793
Which I took
my portion of food...
-Okay, we'’ll just tell him

15:46.827 --> 15:48.103
that you don'’t have his stuff.
-Okay.

15:48.137 --> 15:49.379
-And that he needs to leave.

15:50.689 --> 15:51.862
-What you got, man?
-What'’s his name?

15:51.896 --> 15:53.896
-Michael.
-Michael...

15:53.931 --> 15:57.172
-Yes?
-All right, man, so...
she says your laptop

15:57.206 --> 15:59.206
and watch are not here.

15:59.241 --> 16:01.620
She d-- I don'’t know
where they'’re at, okay?

16:01.655 --> 16:04.000
Says that you got some tools
the last time that
you were here?

16:04.034 --> 16:06.724
-Yes.
-Okay, so, the only thing
that she said

16:06.758 --> 16:10.103
that-- that she'’s willing
to give to you is some food.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.310
And whatever food
you guys bought together,
I don'’t know...

16:13.344 --> 16:17.862
the food that she forged
my signature and purchased
at Costco.

16:17.896 --> 16:20.379
-So what does--
What does she owe you
for the groceries?

16:20.413 --> 16:22.793
-$450.
-Okay.

16:22.827 --> 16:25.379
Well, do you want
any of the food--?
-I don'’t want the food,

16:25.413 --> 16:28.758
I want the money.
-Well, we don'’t--
we don'’t dispute money, okay?

16:28.793 --> 16:30.758
So you guys are gonna
have to figure that out.

16:30.793 --> 16:34.689
-So you can get her
to box up $450 worth
of groceries?

16:34.724 --> 16:36.034
-Okay.
-Throw '’em in my car.

16:36.068 --> 16:37.517
-I'’ll see what she's
willing to do.

16:37.551 --> 16:40.275
-She'’s got the receipt,
so you know exactly
what she bought.

16:40.310 --> 16:42.206
-Okay.
Let me go and talk
to her, okay?

16:42.241 --> 16:43.206
-Yes.

16:44.758 --> 16:47.931
-If you guys can talk,
because we'’re kinda
the middle men here.

16:47.965 --> 16:51.068
Like I said, we don'’t dispute
when it comes to property
or food.

16:51.103 --> 16:53.034
So, if you guys are willing
to do it,

16:53.068 --> 16:54.517
talking while
we'’re standing here,

16:54.551 --> 16:56.482
so nothing happens.
-Oh, are you guys
gonna be here, then?

16:56.517 --> 16:58.172
-I'’ll be right here.
-Okay, that'’s fine.

16:58.206 --> 16:59.689
-Okay.
-I can talk to him
if you guys are here.

16:59.724 --> 17:01.551
-Bring him up here, Jarvis.

17:03.241 --> 17:05.310
She-- She'’s not really sure
about the food.

17:05.344 --> 17:09.275
But I asked her,
you can have at least $450
worth of food.

17:09.310 --> 17:11.103
That'’s up to you guys
to figure out.

17:11.137 --> 17:13.586
Like I told her,
we'’re not gonna get involved--
we don'’t dispute property, okay?

17:13.620 --> 17:15.896
-There'’s that, I know
you wanna take that.

17:15.931 --> 17:19.000
Blueberries...
I haven'’t even--

17:19.034 --> 17:20.689
I don'’t know what he wants.

17:20.724 --> 17:23.172
-It'’s up to you guys.
Do you guys need to talk
and figure this out?

17:23.206 --> 17:25.137
-He'’s not communicating.
What do you want?

17:25.172 --> 17:29.137
What-- What is-- Your--
-All the food you took
outta my refrigerator.

17:29.172 --> 17:33.310
-I didn'’t take all your food.
I left you a bacon.
I took two bacons.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.206
And these are the ones
that we bought at--

17:35.241 --> 17:36.827
w-- I bought at Costco.

17:36.862 --> 17:40.827
-Okay, what about the $450
for some food I just...

17:40.862 --> 17:43.310
spent the money on
the other day?

17:43.344 --> 17:45.793
-That'’s the food.
You have the chicken.
You have a bag of chicken--

17:45.827 --> 17:47.965
-No, it'’s for all
your brother'’s stuff, too.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.379
-For all my brothers'’ stuff,
what are you talkin'’ about?

17:50.413 --> 17:53.551
-That'’s all of our food.
-You packed all his food
into his car.

17:53.586 --> 17:56.689
-Yeah, that'’s all of our food.
-That was the $450
worth of food.

17:56.724 --> 17:58.965
-I'’ll give you half of that.
How about that?

17:59.000 --> 18:02.379
-Why am I gettin'’
half of the money that you spent
for your brother'’s food?

18:02.413 --> 18:05.862
-Because it went
to your house, our house
with each other.

18:05.896 --> 18:07.068
-And where'’s the laptop?
-I don'’t--

18:07.103 --> 18:09.310
-And the watch?
-I don'’t have--

18:09.344 --> 18:11.517
-We'’re not gonna dispute that.
she says she doesn'’t
have it, so...

18:11.551 --> 18:13.137
-I don'’t have it.
I told you, it'’s at your house.

18:13.172 --> 18:14.724
I didn'’t take any of your stuff.
I even left--

18:14.758 --> 18:16.862
-Let'’s-- Let's figure out
the food, guys.
-You were on the laptop.

18:16.896 --> 18:20.310
-Guys... let'’s focus again.
-Obviously, your chicken breasts
is expensive.

18:20.344 --> 18:22.620
Bacon'’s expensive.

18:22.655 --> 18:24.137
Blueberries are expensive.

18:24.172 --> 18:26.413
-You wanna start
takin'’ stuff it's up to you,
whatever your--

18:26.448 --> 18:30.758
I-- as I said, it'’s up to you.
-But give me my beach bag
back, okay?

18:30.793 --> 18:34.344
Oh... I don'’t know what else.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.724
This, this, the ranch dressing
and stuff, that'’s all--

18:37.758 --> 18:39.034
Do you want the blueberries?

18:39.068 --> 18:41.344
Does he want--
Can you ask him...?

18:41.379 --> 18:43.344
-Yeah.
We'’ll-- We'll see if he'’s gonna
come back

18:43.379 --> 18:44.379
and get the blueberries.

18:44.413 --> 18:46.172
-He doesn'’t eat tomatoes.
-Okay.

18:46.206 --> 18:48.206
If you want the tomatoes
and blueberries, go ahead.

18:48.241 --> 18:49.862
-I don'’t wanna see
you or anything after tonight.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.586
He keeps threatening me
about stuff, so I can'’t--

18:52.620 --> 18:55.517
-About what?
-It sounds like he wants
some property back, right?

18:55.551 --> 18:56.793
Some kind of dispute
over property?

18:56.827 --> 18:58.172
-Hold on, what did I
threaten you about?

18:58.206 --> 19:00.241
-About the Costco thing,
when you said go ahead
and buy it.

19:00.275 --> 19:02.724
-Yeah, I'’m-- I-- if you
don'’t give me my stuff,

19:02.758 --> 19:04.620
I'’m gonna press charges.

19:04.655 --> 19:08.551
And I told them that.
-I'’m-- I'm talking to you,
and you keep harassing me.

19:08.586 --> 19:11.379
So I--
-But you weren'’t talkin'.
-I was talkin'’,

19:11.413 --> 19:13.793
I ask you to come out here,
you said you called the cops.
-I have a text,
