00:15.015 --> 00:16.433
[music playing]

00:45.045 --> 00:47.673
[troll 1] Stupid changeling.
[troll 2] Think fast!

00:47.756 --> 00:49.049
-[troll laughs]
-[clatter, glass shatters]

00:49.132 --> 00:50.384
[troll 2] Get out the trash.

00:50.467 --> 00:55.180
Only an Impure would be stupid
enough to raise Angor Rot.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.558
Gunmar can't save him now.
[laughs]

00:57.641 --> 00:59.935
Not so tough without your assassin,
are ye?

01:00.018 --> 01:01.770
-Guilty changeling!
-Fire!

01:01.853 --> 01:04.230
-You throw like a sloth-kin.
-Stupid changeling.

01:04.313 --> 01:07.442
Let's get him down from there
and really have some fun.

01:07.526 --> 01:12.906
Jim? Jim! James Lake Junior!

01:12.990 --> 01:17.536
[Vendel] She allowed Angor Rot
to obtain a Horngazel.

01:17.619 --> 01:21.123
The very key past Trollmarket's defenses?

01:21.206 --> 01:23.584
It's not Claire's fault, it's mine.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.961
I should've gone to the school
for the incantation.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.172
I should've faced Angor Rot.
Not them.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.551
It was in my purse.
Toby and I were dangling off the roof.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.969
He cut it off and left.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.013
It was a great everyday purse.
It went with everything.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.267
We might have time.
Angor Rot rarely attacks during the day...

01:40.350 --> 01:42.394
Angor Rot is unpredictable at best.

01:42.477 --> 01:46.898
And if there isn't anything to stop him
from creating havoc in Trollmarket...

01:46.982 --> 01:51.153
then you have just put
more than yourselves at risk.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.947
[Strickler] Trollhunter! Help!

01:54.031 --> 01:56.617
-Get out of our way, Aaarrrgghh!!!
-No.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.869
Let us discuss this matter
like reasonable trolls!

01:58.952 --> 02:02.080
[grunts]
Ruffians! Who threw that?

02:02.164 --> 02:08.086
-Where's Jim? He gave me his word!
-Put him down! He helped save my mother.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.715
-He's with me.
-He tried to release Gunmar!

02:11.798 --> 02:13.550
Get him out of here!

02:13.634 --> 02:16.887
-Changelings ain't right in Trollmarket!
-[troll] Get rid of him!

02:16.970 --> 02:20.891
It's not going to make a difference.
Angor Rot wants me too,

02:20.974 --> 02:23.310
and the protective barrier
won't stop him.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.269
Hmm.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.023
-What do you mean?
-He has a Horngazel.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.191
[all shout]

02:29.274 --> 02:31.526
Look, you have a right to know!

02:31.610 --> 02:33.528
Let's throw them both out!

02:33.612 --> 02:35.822
[troll] It's time the amulet
calls for another!

02:35.906 --> 02:37.616
-Jimbo!
-It's not his fault!

02:37.699 --> 02:39.660
-Throw them out!
-Throw them out!

02:39.743 --> 02:42.829
-When you finish throwing them out...
-[troll] What's he doing?

02:42.913 --> 02:45.874
...come back and throw me out, too.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.502
Yes, the boy has made grave errors.

02:48.585 --> 02:53.131
But he's come through for us more times
than I give him credit for.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.592
Trollmarket is in danger...

02:55.675 --> 02:59.012
and our greatest defense
has always been our Trollhunter.

02:59.096 --> 03:02.724
He's earned my trust.
He should have earned yours.

03:02.808 --> 03:06.019
-You can throw me out, too!
-And me.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.314
Us too, though technically,
we don't live here.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.566
-I'm just sayin'.
-[Bagdwella] Same for me.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.945
I've always stood with our Trollhunter.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.613
Okay, yeah.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.867
[troll 1] I have to admit, it's true.
[troll 2] Mm.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.536
[both grunt]

03:22.619 --> 03:25.414
What now, our infallible leader?

03:28.333 --> 03:31.962
Now, we get ready to give Angor Rot...

03:32.045 --> 03:34.131
the fight of his life!

03:34.214 --> 03:35.966
[all cheer]

03:36.425 --> 03:38.885
[indistinct chatter]

03:38.969 --> 03:40.512
-[clatters]
-[gnome shrieks]

03:40.595 --> 03:44.099
-Pile them as high as you can!
-More gnomes!

03:45.475 --> 03:46.601
[shudders]

03:46.685 --> 03:49.438
Don't worry, just stay indoors.
Not everyone has to fight.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.607
[sniffles, wails]

03:52.691 --> 03:54.317
Whatever.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.404
-Toby, we have to tell Jim.
-Tell me what?

03:57.487 --> 04:01.116
-[both gasp]
-Tell who what? Nothing to see here.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.035
Chompsky? No way! When did he get out?

04:04.119 --> 04:05.579
[pants]

04:05.662 --> 04:07.497
A little while ago.
We were gonna tell you,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.124
but with everything and your mom...

04:09.207 --> 04:12.753
Why would you hold back the great news?
He escaped the Darklands!

04:12.836 --> 04:15.839
Uh, technically, he didn't.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.634
Gunmar let him out to deliver a message.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.429
Jim, Gunmar knows you killed his son.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.973
And he promises to make a river...

04:25.056 --> 04:28.935
No, an ocean of blood
from your loved ones.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.104
And he's gonna make a throne.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.483
with their... I think he said bones.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.986
-His words. Not mine.
-[growls]

04:38.069 --> 04:41.531
And... And he included a list.

04:41.615 --> 04:46.995
Tobias. Claire. Barbara. Blinkous.

04:47.078 --> 04:50.123
We knew what we were getting into.
After we find the last stone,

04:50.207 --> 04:52.626
we'll find my brother
and end this once and for all.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.127
Draal. Coach Lawrence.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.297
It goes on for a while.
You don't need to listen to this.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.217
It's like you said, we shouldn't
be focused on the fight tomorrow

05:00.300 --> 05:01.426
but the fight today.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.137
It's too bad we've been wasting our
time collecting stones to kill Gunmar

05:04.221 --> 05:05.305
and not Angor Rot.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.765
[Strickler] Or so you think.

05:10.185 --> 05:13.647
Maybe you do have a stone. Angor's eye.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.984
You're saying I can use this
in my amulet?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.820
Jim, you're gonna level up again!

05:19.903 --> 05:24.658
-If cut with the proper guidance.
-Show me where to cut.

05:29.371 --> 05:34.709
Unlock its dark power,
and you'll be able to ward off his magics.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.963
Cleave here, ever so gently.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.471
[chuckles]

05:51.935 --> 05:53.353
Ah-ha!

05:56.439 --> 05:58.441
[groans]
Stubborn hammer!

05:58.525 --> 06:01.069
We're supposed to be on the same team!

06:01.152 --> 06:02.821
[grunts] Ah!

06:02.904 --> 06:03.905
Uh! [thuds]

06:05.031 --> 06:07.075
Follow that facet there.

06:07.158 --> 06:11.079
Careful now,
you only have one chance at this.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.541
Angor Rot?
What's that old fossil gonna do?

06:14.624 --> 06:17.210
There's three of us and one of him.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.462
I'm gonna break him over my knee.
Back breaker!

06:19.546 --> 06:21.464
-[yells]
-[trolls laugh]

06:22.299 --> 06:25.802
And then when he's trying to get up,
power bomb! Boom!

06:25.885 --> 06:27.596
And then he's like, "No, stop!"
I'll be like...

06:27.679 --> 06:30.932
-[trolls chatter, laugh]
-[groans in effort]

06:31.808 --> 06:33.226
[gnomes chitter]

06:34.811 --> 06:36.813
[Draal] I am not afraid of death, Father.

06:38.148 --> 06:41.359
For in the afterlife,
I shall see you again.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.624
Are you sure there isn't
anything more I can do?

06:55.707 --> 06:59.252
The other trolls don't
trust fighting alongside you.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.921
And honestly, neither do I.

07:02.005 --> 07:05.467
You kept your word.
And after everything I've done.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.262
Once again, you've proved
why you are... [scoffs]

07:09.346 --> 07:12.057
the hero, and I am--

07:12.140 --> 07:16.895
-Someone who can change.
-Your idealism is nearly contagious.

07:16.978 --> 07:22.275
-My gratitude cannot be enough.
-Gee, a friendship rock?

07:22.359 --> 07:27.197
After you're done with Angor's eye,
I thought you could use Gunmar's.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.325
You need the last Triumbric stone
to defeat Gunmar.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.411
I've been holding onto it for centuries.

07:33.495 --> 07:37.707
I kept it close in case you drove
a hard bargain to protect me.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.960
But if I kill Gunmar...

07:40.043 --> 07:44.047
Save the children?
Yes, if you rescue my familiar,

07:44.130 --> 07:47.133
then I'll be trapped
in my troll form forever.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.970
But there's nothing left
for me in the human world.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.472
It's not like I'll ever have
a future with your mo--

07:52.555 --> 07:53.974
Don't.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.769
-I have overstayed my welcome.
-Thank you.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.106
You may not believe me, Young Atlas...

08:01.189 --> 08:05.193
but I do wish you luck
and hope we meet again one day.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.736
Goodbye, Mr. Strickler.

08:15.704 --> 08:19.666
[rumbling]

08:22.043 --> 08:25.171
-[all screaming]
-Hurry! Protect yourselves! Everyone!

08:26.256 --> 08:27.841
[troll wails]

08:27.924 --> 08:31.052
Is he knocking?
Is that some sort of troll war etiquette?

08:31.136 --> 08:33.638
I believe he's attempting
to intimidate us.

08:33.722 --> 08:37.517
He's expecting us to hide.
I say we take the fight to him.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.312
Draal, hold the stairs.
Blink, Claire, Tobes, protect Trollmarket.

08:41.395 --> 08:45.650
-Aaarrrgghh!!!, Not Enrique, with me.
-I'm rather comfy where I am.

08:45.734 --> 08:46.693
[yells]

08:48.111 --> 08:49.320
Ya brute!

08:50.363 --> 08:53.783
[rumbling continues]

08:57.162 --> 08:58.747
Huh?

09:00.665 --> 09:04.169
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

09:07.297 --> 09:11.134
We're not letting him past us!
What the-- Watch out!

09:12.177 --> 09:13.970
[roars]

09:15.555 --> 09:20.894
Wowza, big guy, let's keep it PG.
Where's Angor Rot?

09:20.977 --> 09:24.522
It's a diversion!
He must be coming in another way!

09:24.606 --> 09:26.858
-Other way?
-The Gyre Station!

09:33.948 --> 09:35.700
[all shout]

09:39.913 --> 09:41.706
[laughs]

09:44.876 --> 09:47.045
What happened? Where's Angor Rot?

09:47.128 --> 09:52.675
-There he is! Let's do this, boys!
-Back breaker!

09:58.389 --> 10:00.558
Power bomb?

10:00.642 --> 10:02.393
-[Jim] Angor!
-Hmm?

10:02.477 --> 10:06.022
Trollhunter, I have some friends
I'd like you to meet.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.399
[loud rumbling]

10:08.483 --> 10:10.527
[troll 1] What's that noise?
[troll 2] It's an earthquake!

10:15.615 --> 10:18.076
[grunts, screams]

10:20.662 --> 10:23.123
[laughs]

10:24.082 --> 10:26.417
You handle Angor. We got this.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.094
[grunts]

10:43.143 --> 10:44.602
[troll] There's so many of them!

10:47.605 --> 10:49.232
[Toby yells]

10:51.025 --> 10:55.655
When will you learn that Daylight
is mine to command?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.743
No!

11:03.413 --> 11:05.707
Guess I should thank you
for giving me the stink-eye.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.750
My eye!

11:08.334 --> 11:10.378
[shouts]

11:11.921 --> 11:13.298
[Jim shouts]

11:13.381 --> 11:15.675
-Shh!
-Huh?

11:17.385 --> 11:19.429
[all shout]

11:28.813 --> 11:31.232
[all chitter]

11:34.611 --> 11:39.157
Feel the wrath of the Warhammer!

11:39.240 --> 11:41.159
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

11:44.245 --> 11:45.622
Watch out!

11:46.915 --> 11:49.459
-Uh...
-[Toby screams]

11:49.542 --> 11:51.210
[Claire] Oops! Sorry!

11:51.294 --> 11:53.796
[Toby yells] No!

11:56.007 --> 11:58.259
Excellent work, pudgebag.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.928
[gasps]

12:00.011 --> 12:01.763
[shouts]

12:01.846 --> 12:05.975
Oy! No one lays a hand on my sister!
Ya brute!

12:07.018 --> 12:09.187
[both shout]

12:12.315 --> 12:15.652
- You saved my life, bro.
- Let's not get sentimental.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.281
You destroyed my soul, Hunter...

12:20.365 --> 12:23.076
now I shall harvest yours!

12:23.159 --> 12:24.369
[car horn]

12:24.452 --> 12:26.829
[Blinky] Oh, I enjoy this horn!

12:26.913 --> 12:30.291
It's not "Hunter," Angor.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.169
- It's "Hunters"!
- Eat chrome!

12:34.170 --> 12:35.171
Got him!

12:35.254 --> 12:38.549
I drove! Did you see?
I drove a human automobile!

12:38.633 --> 12:39.926
What a thrill!

12:41.094 --> 12:42.845
Blinky.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.809
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Incoming!

12:49.102 --> 12:49.936
[groans]

12:50.019 --> 12:53.523
You thought I could
be defeated that easily?

12:53.606 --> 12:57.652
That your human contraption
could kill me?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.241
[troll 1] Where are they all coming from?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.702
[troll 2] We're surrounded!

13:05.785 --> 13:07.328
[troll 3] There's too many of them!

13:07.412 --> 13:09.497
[yells]

13:11.082 --> 13:14.252
[Blinky] Aaarrrgghh!!!
We require your strength!

13:19.007 --> 13:22.260
[Toby] No! Stop it! Please, don't!

13:23.886 --> 13:26.222
[grunts]

13:31.894 --> 13:33.062
Toby!

13:45.616 --> 13:46.784
No!

13:48.828 --> 13:50.163
Aaarrrgghh!!!

13:52.957 --> 13:56.961
- Aaarrrgghh!!!?
- Wingman.

13:57.045 --> 13:57.962
[screams] Aaarrrgghh!!!

13:58.046 --> 13:59.505
[gasps]

14:00.548 --> 14:02.508
- We are still in battle.
- Aaarrrgghh!!!

14:03.301 --> 14:04.635
Oh, no.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.847
[laughs]

14:11.225 --> 14:13.478
[screams] I'm going to kill you!

14:13.561 --> 14:16.397
-[enraged yells]
-[laughing]

14:19.108 --> 14:24.614
I destroyed your soul!
Your fight is with me! Not them!

14:24.697 --> 14:26.699
[Angor] As you wish, Trollhunter.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.834
[pants]

14:50.765 --> 14:52.433
Clever Hunter!

14:57.980 --> 15:01.067
Just you and me now.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.500
The Hero's Forge.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.586
More like a coward's grave.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.964
[shouts]

15:40.231 --> 15:41.649
[groans]

15:41.732 --> 15:43.401
Enough of your games.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.570
[chanting]

15:52.869 --> 15:54.287
[Jim screams]

15:54.370 --> 15:55.788
[grunts]

15:55.872 --> 15:59.792
Do you ever wonder
how you've lived this long?

15:59.876 --> 16:02.420
- Master Jim!
- No! Let us in!

16:04.672 --> 16:06.257
The only reason you're alive

16:06.340 --> 16:10.303
is because you've let your loved ones
fall in your place!

16:10.386 --> 16:14.390
Your teacher, the changeling!
Your mother!

16:14.474 --> 16:16.184
No! Jim!

16:16.267 --> 16:21.481
And now your simple friend,
Aaarrrgghh!!!, is dead!

16:21.564 --> 16:22.982
[screams] No!

16:27.320 --> 16:30.698
But where are your loved ones now, Hunter?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.366
Up here, Rot Head!

16:32.450 --> 16:34.202
[shouts]

16:45.463 --> 16:47.882
[panting]

16:50.259 --> 16:52.720
[grunts]

16:55.181 --> 16:56.807
[sighs]

17:02.438 --> 17:03.981
Angor Rot is defeated!

17:05.233 --> 17:09.278
-Trollmarket is protected once again!
-[all cheer]

17:10.363 --> 17:11.948
[groans]

17:21.624 --> 17:22.875
Jim!

17:28.214 --> 17:31.008
- Is he really gone?
- He better be.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.885
Yeah. He better be.

17:36.264 --> 17:39.517
<i>- </i> [whispering] <i>Finally.</i>
<i>- Our souls are free.</i>

17:39.600 --> 17:42.395
<i>We return to our brethren.</i>

17:45.273 --> 17:46.691
[whispering continues]

17:46.774 --> 17:51.070
What... I mean, who are they?

17:51.153 --> 17:55.700
<i>These are the spirits</i>
<i>of our fallen brethren.</i>

17:55.783 --> 18:00.830
<i>Trollhunters who lost both</i>
<i>soul and life to Angor Rot.</i>

18:00.913 --> 18:05.209
<i>Our brothers and sisters shall</i>
<i>take their proper place in the void</i>

18:05.293 --> 18:07.336
<i>and rest in peace.</i>

18:07.420 --> 18:11.799
<i>Thanks to you, James Lake Junior,</i>
<i>and your friends.</i>

18:11.882 --> 18:15.761
<i>You were right,</i>
<i>you are stronger together.</i>

18:15.845 --> 18:17.763
<i>We are in your debt.</i>

18:17.847 --> 18:21.309
<i>But the day will come, Trollhunter,</i>

18:21.392 --> 18:24.687
<i>when you must finish the fight alone.</i>

18:26.022 --> 18:27.648
Father?

18:27.732 --> 18:33.571
<i>My son, I am so sorry</i>
<i>for pushing you away.</i>

18:33.654 --> 18:36.991
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

18:37.074 --> 18:38.367
[gasps] Father.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.329
Father. Father!

18:44.040 --> 18:46.000
<i>Return to our brethren.</i>

18:46.083 --> 18:48.294
<i>Our souls are free!</i>

18:48.377 --> 18:49.920
[sighs]

18:56.636 --> 18:59.764
[Toby sobs]

19:13.069 --> 19:18.407
Toby, hold onto that anger.
Save it for the Darklands.

19:25.623 --> 19:26.749
Jim.

19:29.001 --> 19:33.255
[Jim] <i>In darkest tide,</i>
<i>when Daylight darest wane...</i>

19:33.339 --> 19:37.927
<i>the Myrddin Wylt</i>
<i>obscured a shadow's bane.</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:43.099
<i>Three forces elemental thou must seek.</i>

19:43.182 --> 19:47.812
<i>In marshland, caverns deep</i>
<i>and mountain's peak.</i>

19:47.895 --> 19:52.024
<i>Where worthy perish,</i>
<i>ye'll prevail in night.</i>

19:52.108 --> 19:56.028
<i>And eclipse all who quarry</i>
<i>with thy might.</i>

19:56.112 --> 20:01.826
For the doom of Gunmar,
Eclipse is mine to command!

20:38.154 --> 20:39.697
[Blinky] Master Jim!

20:43.117 --> 20:45.286
[Toby] Dude, what are you doing?
[Claire] Jim, don't!

20:46.662 --> 20:49.665
Jim, no!
You promised we'd go together!

20:49.749 --> 20:54.211
The amulet chose me.
I can't lose any more of you.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.760
Maybe I can manually override the lock.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.986
[groans] Whoa.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.950
[Toby] Come on, Jimbo! We're a team!
Don't do this!

21:25.034 --> 21:28.746
I'm sorry. I have to finish the fight.

21:28.829 --> 21:29.830
Alone.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.293
But the amulet chose me.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.591
- Jim!
- I'm sorry.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.802
[Claire] No! Jim!

21:47.556 --> 21:49.600
[Toby] <i>Jim!</i>

21:49.683 --> 21:52.478
[Blinky] <i>Master Jim, what have you done?</i>

22:06.283 --> 22:08.369
Get ready, Gunmar.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.753
