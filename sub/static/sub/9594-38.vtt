WEBVTT

00:27.695 --> 00:30.598
Oh...

00:30.631 --> 00:32.466
Yeah.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.136
I got three letters
for you tonight.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.709
CYBORG: No, no, no and no!

00:41.742 --> 00:44.212
They are "V" "H" and "S."

00:44.245 --> 00:47.781
That's right.
I got VHSes for days.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.283
For days.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.818
Can we watch The Golden Girls?

00:50.851 --> 00:52.553
I love
those sassy, old broads!

00:52.586 --> 00:57.558
And I would like to watch
The Crosby Pudding Half
Hour Show of Sweaters.

00:57.591 --> 01:01.295
Theo, get your glorp-nops
off the kitchen table.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.396
Rudy!

01:02.430 --> 01:04.832
Let's watch Alf again.
I love Alf.

01:04.865 --> 01:08.669
Yes, eat that cat,
Alf, eat him.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.571
He's hiding
in the kitchen drawer, Alf.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.441
But be patient.
Savor the hunt, you beast!

01:13.474 --> 01:15.443
I want to watch me
some Manimal.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.610
A guy
that can turn into animals,

01:16.644 --> 01:18.612
-that's so cheeseball.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.148
Those are all great shows.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.517
But tonight we are watching
The A-Team.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.887
"A" is the highest of letters,
it must be the best.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.425
It's about four cool dudes
who ride around in a van
with a stripe.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.295
I love stripes! Was it red?

01:34.328 --> 01:35.696
You know it was red!

01:35.729 --> 01:37.865
And they would protect
the innocent from bad guys.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.633
Oh. Kind of like us.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.735
Except they weren't lame!

01:41.769 --> 01:44.738
They made cool weapons
out of junk, like oil drums
and pieces of discarded metal

01:44.772 --> 01:46.174
and oil drums!

01:46.207 --> 01:48.442
That sounds so awesome!

01:48.476 --> 01:49.510
It was!

01:51.412 --> 01:53.214
Now, let's get
this party started!

01:53.247 --> 01:54.482
Where's the remote?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.350
I have not seen
the remote controller.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.751
-I don't know.
-Beats me.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.220
Psh, I don't know.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.422
It's probably
just in the couch cushion.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.392
Ew.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.230
Have you seen the remote,
Sticky Joe?

02:09.263 --> 02:11.499
-Howdy!
-Then you're useless to us!

02:11.532 --> 02:13.901
Beat it, Sticky Joe. Beat it!

02:15.969 --> 02:19.640
It's not here. The remote.
It's not here!

02:22.910 --> 02:27.181
Hey, it's okay, Cyborg.
We can just use the buttons
on the TV.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.383
The buttons? The buttons!
You're right!

02:29.417 --> 02:32.152
The TV's got all sorts
of buttons for things.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.691
Menu...

02:40.661 --> 02:41.395
Would you relax?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.197
The remote
will turn up eventually.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.233
We'll watch The A-Team
some other time.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.800
This is not about The A-Team.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.502
Or Charles in Charge,
or Webster, or Small Wonder,

02:48.536 --> 02:51.138
or Silver Spoons,
or Out of This World,
or Magnum, P.I.,

02:51.171 --> 02:52.840
or MacGyver,
or Perfect Strangers,
or Facts of Life,

02:52.873 --> 02:54.174
or Happy Days,
or Who's the Boss?
or Head of the Class,

02:54.208 --> 02:56.544
or Too Close for Comfort,
or Knight Rider,

02:56.577 --> 02:57.811
or Dukes of Hazzard,
or Greatest American Hero.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.313
Cyborg, gimme a break.

02:59.347 --> 03:03.451
Without TV I don't know
what to do with myself.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.686
It's just TV, Cyborg.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.120
"Just TV"?

03:07.154 --> 03:11.559
The best moments of my life
have been sitting in front
of that guy.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.828
He teaches me life lessons,
made me laugh,

03:14.862 --> 03:17.831
and filled lots of empty time.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.702
Wow. You...
You sound like a crazy person.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.705
I think we should
use this opportunity
to take a break from TV.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.907
What?
Why would we want to do that?

03:26.940 --> 03:31.579
Because concerned parents
have theorized for decades
that TV rots the brain!

03:31.612 --> 03:33.614
Well, that's obviously
ridiculous.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.849
TV keeps your brain
active, healthy and strong.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.320
I don't know, dude.
If a parent said it,
it has to be true.

03:39.353 --> 03:43.791
Then, instead of watching TV
we're gonna spend our time
hanging out with each other!

03:43.824 --> 03:45.493
-Yes!
-Yes!

03:49.597 --> 03:54.368
Without TV you really notice
how long every second is.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.873
Are you serious?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.709
How many more
of those are there
before we go to sleep?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.977
Approximately 32,000.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.747
Oh, I am not doing this
32,000 more times!

04:06.780 --> 04:09.383
All right, we need an activity
to occupy our time.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.819
Let's engage in
some meaningful conversation.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.987
How do you
meaningfully conversate, bro?

04:14.021 --> 04:16.857
We just express our thoughts
and feelings with words.

04:16.890 --> 04:17.891
-Oh.
-Thoughts...

04:17.925 --> 04:19.026
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.894
-All right.
-Great. Uh, I'll start.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.496
Um...

04:22.530 --> 04:26.600
Good afternoon.
These are a nice day...
For things.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.905
Um...
Hi, I'm a person.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.309
I know when I do things.

04:35.343 --> 04:40.448
-One time... I saw.
-Uh...

04:41.549 --> 04:44.685
You guys, uh,
remember... Things?

04:44.718 --> 04:48.789
-Yeah.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.065
We have to find the remote
and watch TV. Now!

04:58.098 --> 04:59.867
Don't panic, Titans.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.835
We just have to do
whatever people did
for fun before TV.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.572
-Oh, I've heard of those.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.808
-It's just people walking!

05:07.841 --> 05:11.579
And why are the automobiles
traveling so slowly?

05:11.612 --> 05:14.382
Is it deliberate?
To make it the boring?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.684
Don't tell me
that's another marching band!

05:16.717 --> 05:20.120
It's just marching band,
after marching band,
after marching band!

05:20.153 --> 05:23.491
Whoa! Look at him
spin that baton!

05:23.524 --> 05:24.858
Okay, I'm over it.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.863
CYBORG: I can't, I can't.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.832
I can't take anymore parades
or terrible conversations!

05:31.865 --> 05:33.967
Let's just find the remote
and watch Murder, She Wrote.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.604
That's just going
to rot your brain, Cyborg.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.106
Instead, let's use
these new seconds we have

05:39.139 --> 05:42.776
to pursue
fulfilling activities
that enrich our lives.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.480
Beast Boy, haven't you always
wanted to learn to play
keyboard?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.681
Just don't have
the time, brah.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.383
-Now you do!

05:49.417 --> 05:52.119
And Raven, haven't you always
wanted to be a bodybuilder?

05:52.152 --> 05:53.954
-No.
-Now you can!

05:53.987 --> 05:57.525
Star, you've always wanted
to do volunteer work
for the poor,

05:57.558 --> 05:59.527
but didn't want to miss
your favorite shows.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.862
There are so many
of the poor people,

06:01.895 --> 06:04.632
but even more
of the shows to watch.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.867
Now we can all
follow our passions.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.137
Because without TV,
we have nothing better to do!

06:10.170 --> 06:11.472
Titans, go!

06:30.057 --> 06:31.559
Who wants tapas?

06:35.696 --> 06:39.900
Mmm. My friends
at the kitchen of soup
would love this recipe!

06:39.933 --> 06:43.103
Great source
of protein.
-You said it, mama.

06:43.136 --> 06:47.107
Look at us, Titans.
We did it! We filled time!

06:47.140 --> 06:49.643
So many seconds went by, yo!

06:51.779 --> 06:54.915
So why do we feel
so empty inside?

06:54.948 --> 06:56.717
Maybe it's because
learning to play the keyboard

06:56.750 --> 06:58.786
didn't teach you
about friendship.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.655
And volunteering
didn't make you
a better person.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.091
And there's nothing funny
about bodybuilding.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.659
You can say that again.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.828
Only TV can give us
those things!

07:07.861 --> 07:10.631
Life without TV
is meaningless.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.200
The Teen Titans
are supposed to be heroes,

07:13.233 --> 07:15.769
but the real hero
is television.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.204
Can I get a "Turn it on"?

07:17.237 --> 07:19.139
ALL: Turn it on!

07:19.172 --> 07:21.809
Hey, what's that smell?

07:21.842 --> 07:24.111
Oh, that's not right.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.913
-Ew.
-Yeah.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.781
I do not understand.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.717
No, no, no!

07:30.684 --> 07:34.655
Uh, this is bad!

07:34.688 --> 07:37.558
Your brains,
they are rotting.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.727
But we haven't
been watching TV.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.194
Exactly!

07:41.228 --> 07:43.063
Just as I suspected!

07:43.096 --> 07:47.635
TV keeps your brain from
rotting by feeding it
information and good times.

07:47.668 --> 07:51.171
Huh, but your brain
doesn't stink, Cyborg.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.807
It's because I have watched
so much quality programming,

07:53.841 --> 07:55.709
my brain is stronger
than yours.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.678
Then the rest of us
need to get in front of a TV

07:57.711 --> 07:59.580
before our brains
rot away completely.

07:59.613 --> 08:03.584
But the device that
controls remotely
is still missing.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.785
Then we improvise!

08:04.818 --> 08:06.019
Just like The A-Team.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.663
I love it
when a plan comes together.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.666
What plan?
That's not a TV.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.602
Just look.
It's a show about plants.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.637
This is just as good
as anything on TV!

08:23.671 --> 08:26.874
Ooh, ooh!
Can we change the channel?
I wanna watch something else!

08:26.907 --> 08:28.542
No problem.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.978
How about The Cockroach Show?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.846
I wanna watch the show
about wall.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.247
Which one
are you talking about, Rave?

08:34.281 --> 08:36.083
You know, the one about wall.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.786
Oh, right. The Wall Show.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.290
Huh. Is that stain new,
or from the last episode?

08:43.323 --> 08:44.625
I think it's new.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.761
Oh, look!
It's a crossover episode
from The Cockroach Show.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.163
The smell
is getting worse!

08:50.197 --> 08:51.799
It's not working, Cyborg.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.135
How about now?

08:58.706 --> 09:00.540
How about now?

09:03.811 --> 09:06.780
Your brains!
They've completely rotted.

09:06.814 --> 09:10.884
It's so nice out.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.253
Let's go for a hike.

09:13.286 --> 09:17.324
Join us for a game
of miniature golf, brah.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.994
I'm taking a French class.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.165
Your rotted brains
are making you crazy!

09:25.198 --> 09:27.968
No! No!
I don't want to do activities!

09:28.001 --> 09:29.069
You can't make me!

09:29.102 --> 09:30.704
Hi-yah!

09:31.371 --> 09:33.674
TV

09:33.707 --> 09:36.610
I've raised
countless children, Cyborg,

09:36.644 --> 09:39.279
but you have always
been my favorite.

09:39.312 --> 09:43.751
You might be surprised to know
that all those years you spent
staring at me,

09:43.784 --> 09:46.086
I was staring
right back at you.

09:46.119 --> 09:50.791
And it's been a joy
to help shape you
into the man you are today.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.861
-I love you, Cyborg.
-I love you, too, TV.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.063
Now, the only way
to save your friends

09:56.096 --> 09:59.366
is to reverse their brain rot
with quality programming.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.702
Then turn yourself on, dude.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.704
I don't know
how these buttons work.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.639
No one does.
Where's the remote?

10:05.673 --> 10:07.675
We lost it.
It could be anywhere.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.110
Then we're going
to have to find it!

10:10.143 --> 10:11.712
Let's go!

10:29.196 --> 10:30.263
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

10:31.765 --> 10:33.033
-So nice out.
-I'm taking French class.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.735
-ROBIN: A hike.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.875
''Huh, What?''

10:41.909 --> 10:44.177
Thanks for fixing
our brains, TV.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.246
No problem.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.049
So, I was thinking,
it's such a beautiful day
why don't we all go on a hike?

10:49.082 --> 10:52.252
Or perhaps, take in
some culture at a museum.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.921
I'm just messing with ya.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.790
Let's watch
18 hours of A-Team.
