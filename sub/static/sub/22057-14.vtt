<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...

00:03.260 --> 00:06.852
Vice is moving in on this place
in minutes. We have to go, now.

00:06.952 --> 00:08.872
Do you understand that
once you're in the system,

00:08.954 --> 00:10.320
I can't help you?

00:10.322 --> 00:12.422
Get on the bike now.

00:13.191 --> 00:14.557
Before my dad died,

00:14.559 --> 00:16.526
I promised him
I'd look out for Koa.

00:16.528 --> 00:17.723
Sometimes you
gotta let people

00:17.724 --> 00:19.129
make their own mistakes.

00:19.130 --> 00:20.129
That's the only way

00:20.131 --> 00:21.397
you can really
protect your brother.

00:29.707 --> 00:30.973
They had no Yakuza ink.

00:30.975 --> 00:32.107
Yeah, you're chasing a ghost.

00:32.109 --> 00:34.076
No, Adam,
we are chasing a ghost.

00:34.078 --> 00:35.945

a special division

00:35.947 --> 00:37.446

task force.

00:37.448 --> 00:38.747
Now you got the connections.

00:38.749 --> 00:41.283
You know how these guys think.
You know how they act.

00:41.285 --> 00:43.552
I want you to help me
find who did all this.

- What?

I feel a speech coming.

03:34.684 --> 03:36.651
No, there's no speech.

There's no... Okay, all right.
If I was gonna give you

03:39.356 --> 03:41.723

“Don't screw this up.

03:45.061 --> 03:46.594
Don't embarrass me.”

03:46.596 --> 03:48.229
Sound about right?

03:48.231 --> 03:50.231
Yes, very good.

03:50.233 --> 03:54.502
Look. This is a really
good opportunity for you.

03:54.504 --> 03:57.305
All right? It could...
it could lead to something.

03:57.307 --> 03:58.573
Yeah, I know.

03:59.509 --> 04:00.475
I know.

04:00.477 --> 04:03.077
All right. Let's go.

04:03.079 --> 04:06.247
Remember, be polite.
Yes, Mom.

04:06.249 --> 04:08.249
Good morning. Hey.
Hi.

04:08.251 --> 04:10.018
How's it going, Koa?

04:10.020 --> 04:11.920
Good. You?
Good. This is Eli.

04:11.922 --> 04:14.889
He's the boss around here.
Hey, good to have you.

04:14.891 --> 04:17.125
Adam tells me
you've worked on some remodels.

04:17.127 --> 04:19.627
Yeah, I laid tile, hung drywall,
stuff like that.

04:19.629 --> 04:21.362
Okay. Well, good.

04:21.363 --> 04:22.830
Let's get you set up.

04:22.832 --> 04:25.133
Follow me. I'll, uh, swing by later.
We'll grab lunch.

04:25.135 --> 04:27.201
- Okay?
- Shoots.

04:27.203 --> 04:28.636
Bye! Thank you so much.

04:28.638 --> 04:30.538
Hey, it's no trouble.
You're the best.

04:30.540 --> 04:31.839
Happy to help.

04:31.841 --> 04:33.441
Hey, I got to run. Work.

04:33.443 --> 04:35.143
Hey, how's that going?

04:35.145 --> 04:36.644
I still got Hideki in play.

04:36.646 --> 04:39.213
Thinking he's my best bet to
finding our mystery player.

04:39.215 --> 04:41.983
- - Look at you. You're like Eliot Ness.
Yeah.

04:41.985 --> 04:45.687
Except I don't know who
my Al Capone is supposed to be.

04:45.689 --> 04:47.722
<i>I don't even care</i>
<i>that you're wrong.</i>

04:47.724 --> 04:49.691
Like, people make mistakes all
the time. You made a mistake.

04:49.693 --> 04:51.225
- Dude, this is on you.
- Just the fact that you can't admit to it.

04:51.227 --> 04:52.627
- You can't say, “I made a mistake.”
- This is on you.

04:52.629 --> 04:54.095
What are you talking about?
Are you kidding me?

04:54.097 --> 04:55.763
What are you talking about?
I'm the first person to admit

04:55.765 --> 04:56.898
when I'm wrong.
You're not

04:56.900 --> 04:58.199
the first person to admit anything.
Shut up.

04:58.201 --> 04:59.300
Pua, I didn't see you
standing there.

04:59.302 --> 05:00.568
I'm not gonna shut up.
I'm sorry.

05:00.570 --> 05:01.903
Thanks for coming.
Of course.

05:01.905 --> 05:03.638
Duke said you guys asked
for me by name.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.273
What's going on?
We got robbed

05:05.275 --> 05:07.208
last night.
Danny didn't lock the restaurant last night.

05:07.210 --> 05:09.010
- That's fake news, okay?
- Huh?

05:09.012 --> 05:10.545
Danny forgot to
lock the shop.

05:10.547 --> 05:11.980
That's not what
happened. That is

05:11.982 --> 05:13.414
an alternative fact.
You know what's crazy to me?

05:13.416 --> 05:15.650
It's crazy that they-they let
someone as careless as you

05:15.652 --> 05:18.052
carry a firearm. That's what's nuts to me.
Who's “they”?

05:18.054 --> 05:19.420
You hired me, you putz.

05:19.422 --> 05:21.389
The state has nothing to do
with it-- you hired me.

05:21.391 --> 05:22.590
Well, that was a lapse
of my judgment, wasn't it?

05:22.592 --> 05:23.558
Okay,
okay, okay.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.559
Time-out. Time-out.

05:24.561 --> 05:25.727
All right?

05:25.729 --> 05:26.761
You, over there. You,

05:26.763 --> 05:28.062
over there.

05:28.064 --> 05:29.831
All right,
I'm sorry you guys got hit.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.332
Can you tell me
what was taken?

05:31.334 --> 05:33.001
Tools.

05:33.003 --> 05:34.602
They left him, obviously.

05:34.604 --> 05:36.304
But we... A lot
of tools. A sander,

05:36.306 --> 05:37.438
nail gun...

05:37.440 --> 05:38.940
They had a whole
bunch of stuff.

05:38.942 --> 05:40.208
We had a drop saw, all right?

05:40.210 --> 05:41.442
We had a hammer drill.
Anyway,

05:41.444 --> 05:42.644
the point is,
A whole bunch of stuff.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.145
is that you were
like a psychopath

05:44.147 --> 05:45.780
when I stole that
Christmas tree.

05:45.782 --> 05:47.315
You tracked it down
like a crazy person.

05:47.317 --> 05:49.150
So I figured maybe you
could help with his mistake.

05:49.152 --> 05:50.652
You said
you were gonna

05:50.654 --> 05:53.621
lock the restaurant.
You didn't lock the restaurant.

05:53.623 --> 05:55.823
Why would I lock it?
Steve, you were here.

05:55.825 --> 05:57.325
You said you were gonna
stay here and sand the bar

05:57.327 --> 05:58.926
till 9:00 at night!
How... Even if I wanted

05:58.928 --> 06:01.929
to lock this restaurant, you
are the “keeper of the keys.”

06:01.931 --> 06:03.798
Are you not?
We made a big deal about it.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.867
You made me sign the thing.
How-how could I...

06:05.869 --> 06:07.268
You-You're the key guy.
Okay, okay.

06:07.270 --> 06:08.903
The keys.
Yeah, the keys.

06:08.905 --> 06:10.471
Let's talk about those keys.
Good, let's talk about 'em.

06:10.473 --> 06:11.939
Those keys are on a ring.
Yeah.

06:11.941 --> 06:14.042
And also on that ring is a fob. A little fob
Mm-hmm.

06:14.044 --> 06:15.910
that belongs to a car that I own
Yeah.

06:15.912 --> 06:17.712
that you drive all the time
that was in your pocket!

06:17.714 --> 06:19.380
I didn't have any pockets.

06:19.382 --> 06:21.182
Last night, I was wearing pants
with no pockets.

06:21.184 --> 06:23.251
How do I have keys in a pocket

06:23.253 --> 06:25.787
with pants with no pockets?
Lt. Cargo Pants,

06:25.789 --> 06:27.021
when do you not have pockets?
I don't always

06:27.023 --> 06:28.289
wear cargo pants.
You were wearing cargo pants

06:28.291 --> 06:29.390
last night.
No, I wasn't.

06:29.392 --> 06:30.892
You sleep in cargo pants.
No, I don't.

06:30.894 --> 06:32.360
I sleep in pajamas.

06:32.362 --> 06:33.761
Okay? Pua,
listen to me.

06:33.763 --> 06:35.296
No pressure.

06:35.298 --> 06:37.198
This is the most important
case you've ever worked.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.468
If you don't get our stuff back,
I'm gonna have to listen

06:40.470 --> 06:43.805
to this... revisionist history
for the next three months.

06:43.807 --> 06:45.306
I'll get right on it. I'll-I'll get right on it.
Okay? All right?

06:45.308 --> 06:47.175
Thank you. Please.
And-and if you guys can,

06:47.177 --> 06:48.676
just get me an itemized list
of everything

06:48.678 --> 06:50.278
that's missing. And I'll...
Fine.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.046
I'll initiate the report ASAP.

06:52.048 --> 06:54.849
And that way, you guys can file
an insurance claim right away.

06:54.851 --> 06:56.851
Well, well, yeah, that's gonna be a problem,
'cause we don't have insurance,

06:56.853 --> 06:58.286
'cause he thought it'd be
too early to get insurance.

06:58.288 --> 07:00.254
Calculated risk.
How'd that work out?

07:00.256 --> 07:01.856
It was a calculated risk.
Okay, you know what,

07:01.858 --> 07:02.924
I don't want to listen to you anymore.
Hang on. Shush.

07:02.926 --> 07:03.725
You can go.

07:03.727 --> 07:04.959
I can't t...
I...

07:04.961 --> 07:06.894
McGarrett.

07:08.598 --> 07:10.598
So, caretaker was walking
the grounds late last night

07:10.600 --> 07:13.401
when he noticed that one of the
graves had fresh dirt on top.

07:13.403 --> 07:15.937
Looked to him like it had
just been dug up and refilled.

07:15.939 --> 07:18.940
So, he got worried that maybe
someone may have dug up the body

07:18.942 --> 07:20.975
during the night.
Decided to check for himself.

07:20.977 --> 07:23.010
Turns out he was right
about the body.

07:23.012 --> 07:25.580
Only he didn't expect to find
another one in its place.

07:25.582 --> 07:28.416
Our Vic here was working
security last night.

07:28.418 --> 07:29.383
Suffered one gunshot wound

07:29.385 --> 07:31.219
to the chest.

07:31.221 --> 07:34.322
But according to Dr. Cunha,
cause of death was asphyxiation.

07:34.324 --> 07:35.890
Wait a minute, you're
telling me this guy,

07:35.892 --> 07:38.192
he happens upon somebody
jacking a body,

07:38.194 --> 07:40.294
then he gets shot before
he can do anything about it,

07:40.296 --> 07:41.462
and then he gets buried alive?

07:41.464 --> 07:43.030
Yeah, well, that's how it looks.

07:43.032 --> 07:44.499
And, uh, based off
of footprints,

07:44.501 --> 07:46.367
it looks like our perp
was out here alone.

07:46.369 --> 07:47.835
Okay, so, uh,

07:47.837 --> 07:51.572
what, uh, body snatching,
uh, uh, for profit?

07:51.574 --> 07:52.807
Satanic cult stuff?

07:52.809 --> 07:54.942
What do you think?
How do you profit off a corpse?

07:54.944 --> 07:59.013
You sell bones and soft tissue
to a bone or a tissue bank.

07:59.015 --> 08:00.148
I know this meth head,
lives down the block.

08:00.150 --> 08:01.783
I mean, it's how
he makes his money.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.684
That's it. That's solely...
That's, like, his profession.

08:03.686 --> 08:05.620
Both theories are valid,
but, for all we know,

08:05.622 --> 08:07.488
there could've been some personal motive
involved. What do we know

08:07.490 --> 08:10.124
about the prior occupant of this grave?
Well, let me guess.

08:10.126 --> 08:11.659
Name's Travis Hinkley.

08:11.661 --> 08:14.529
Born July 26, 1978.

08:14.531 --> 08:15.830
Died a couple
weeks ago.

08:15.832 --> 08:18.132
He was “gentle of heart
and generous of spirit”"

08:18.134 --> 08:19.467
That's all I'm
getting right now.

08:19.469 --> 08:20.568
That's excellent detective work.

08:20.570 --> 08:21.736
Thank you. Great.
Thank you so much,

08:21.738 --> 08:23.371
uh, Danny Williams.
Thanks.

08:23.373 --> 08:24.438
We know
anything else?

08:24.440 --> 08:26.774
Uh, n-not yet, sir.
But I'm on it.

08:26.776 --> 08:29.377
All right, good. The more
we can find out about this guy,

08:29.379 --> 08:31.813
it might tell us something
about whoever took him.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.114
Yes, sir.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.416
All right.
He's gonna, um...

08:35.418 --> 08:37.385
The “sir.” He didn't
tone down the “sir” thing.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.386
Aw, we're working on it.
Working on it. Yeah.

08:39.389 --> 08:42.056
I got an idea. You get,
um, one of those, uh,

08:42.058 --> 08:45.326
dog shock collars, and - Yeah.
every time he says “sir,” you...

08:45.328 --> 08:46.661
That's a good idea.
You know, you buy,

08:46.663 --> 08:48.763
maybe get two for the price
of one. Put one on you

08:48.765 --> 08:49.931
for every time you say
something stupid like that.

08:49.933 --> 08:51.666
What do you say?
That's funny.

09:25.368 --> 09:27.068
Morning.

09:28.738 --> 09:30.238
Give you a lift?

09:30.240 --> 09:31.639
You for real?

09:31.641 --> 09:33.641
What do you mean?

09:33.643 --> 09:36.010
I mean, I just walked out
of there ten seconds ago.

09:36.012 --> 09:38.946
What are you, some kind of sicko
who trolls women's prisons?

09:38.948 --> 09:40.214
Is that, like,
a fetish?

09:40.216 --> 09:41.382
No, I'm not.

09:41.384 --> 09:43.918
And, yeah, it probably is.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.286
Well, I got a ride coming.

09:45.288 --> 09:46.921
Actually, you don't.

09:46.923 --> 09:48.456
Jimmy's Cab, right?

09:48.458 --> 09:50.825
Reservation under Nomura,
first name Jessie?

09:50.827 --> 09:53.628
Yeah, I canceled that.

09:53.630 --> 09:54.729
What?

09:54.731 --> 09:56.564
I thought you and I should talk.
Who are you?

09:56.566 --> 09:58.232
What do you want?

09:58.234 --> 10:00.735
My name is Adam Noshimuri.

10:00.737 --> 10:03.437
And... it's better
if we talk somewhere else.

10:03.439 --> 10:05.606
Get in.

10:07.010 --> 10:10.411
Look, you can sit
in back if you like.

10:10.413 --> 10:12.480
Hey, trust me.

10:12.482 --> 10:16.317
You're gonna want to hear
what I have to say.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.087
Undercover?

10:36.089 --> 10:37.722
It's a long-term
assignment.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.090
You'll infiltrate
the crew,

10:39.092 --> 10:41.058
gather Intel and
report back to me.

10:41.060 --> 10:43.360
There's risk involved,
but there's also money.

10:43.362 --> 10:44.495
You'd be well-paid.

10:44.497 --> 10:46.564
To snitch? Yeah,
I would hope so.

10:46.566 --> 10:48.666
It's more like keeping
your ears to the ground.

10:48.668 --> 10:50.701
You see, it's not
this crew I'm after.

10:50.703 --> 10:53.003
I'm looking for someone bigger.
Someone in the shadows.

10:53.005 --> 10:55.673
But to find them I need
to keep a close eye

10:55.675 --> 10:57.174
on a local Yakuza boss.

10:57.176 --> 10:59.009
Guy by the name of
Hideki Tashiro.

10:59.011 --> 11:01.679
Why me?

11:01.681 --> 11:04.949
Well, for starters, Hideki,
he doesn't like outsiders,

11:04.951 --> 11:07.118
but in your case I think
he'll make an exception.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.053
Because... ?

11:09.055 --> 11:10.688
You're real good
at being bad.

11:10.690 --> 11:13.190
Burglary, fraud,

11:13.192 --> 11:14.358
money laundering,
grand theft.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.494
Finding people
with those skills

11:16.496 --> 11:18.796
has gotten a lot tougher since
Five-O did their big sweep.

11:18.798 --> 11:22.500
The talent pool out there
is thin. Plus,

11:22.502 --> 11:25.770
you're an orphan, which is
something he'll find appealing.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.505
Why's that?

11:27.507 --> 11:31.208
'Cause family can be
an Achilles heel.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.711
A way to get to someone.

11:33.713 --> 11:36.680
Guess I wouldn't know.

11:36.682 --> 11:39.483
And the fact that I'm a girl,
that's not gonna be a turnoff?

11:39.485 --> 11:43.587
No. He's a very
forward-thinking criminal.

11:43.589 --> 11:46.290
This is what
you'd be paid.

11:48.261 --> 11:50.494
I got to admit,

11:50.496 --> 11:52.296
my first 30 minutes
on the outside

11:52.298 --> 11:54.598
aren't going the way
I would've expected.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
So what do you say?

12:00.239 --> 12:04.708
I say money means squat if
I'm not around to spend it.

12:04.710 --> 12:07.545
If I get made as a CI,
that doesn't end well for me.

12:07.547 --> 12:08.946
Pass.

12:08.948 --> 12:10.948
Look. I know these people.

12:10.950 --> 12:12.249
I know how they think.

12:12.251 --> 12:13.484
I can prepare you.

12:13.486 --> 12:15.219
I can tell you
what to expect.

12:15.221 --> 12:17.087
- I can keep you safe.
- Right.

12:17.089 --> 12:18.389
You realize I'm
offering you more

12:18.391 --> 12:20.291
than just money here.

12:20.293 --> 12:22.960
I'm offering you something
most ex-cons never get.

12:22.962 --> 12:24.195
What's that?

12:24.197 --> 12:25.529
A purpose.

12:25.531 --> 12:28.499
Without one, you're very likely
to end up back inside.

12:28.501 --> 12:29.934
You think so, huh?

12:29.936 --> 12:31.068
Yeah. I do.

12:31.070 --> 12:32.937
Because I've known
people like you,

12:32.939 --> 12:34.705
people always looking
for a shortcut.

12:34.707 --> 12:36.907
I've been around them
my whole life.

12:36.909 --> 12:39.443
Maybe you have, but that
doesn't mean you know me.

12:39.445 --> 12:40.911
You with your tailored shirt.

12:40.913 --> 12:42.746
Your $200 haircut.

12:42.748 --> 12:44.481
You don't know me.

12:45.551 --> 12:47.685
See ya.

12:47.687 --> 12:49.820
Look, where are you going?

12:49.822 --> 12:51.121
I'll give you a lift.

12:51.123 --> 12:52.923
I'm good.

13:03.269 --> 13:04.768
So this is what our
missing cadaver

13:04.770 --> 13:06.804
looked like
back when he was alive.

13:06.806 --> 13:08.372
At the time of his death
he was unemployed

13:08.374 --> 13:09.607
and he has no surviving family

13:09.609 --> 13:12.276
on the island.
Okay. And he died how?

13:12.278 --> 13:13.544
Malaria.

13:13.546 --> 13:15.179
Well, that's a pretty exotic way

13:15.181 --> 13:16.380
to go for a local boy.

13:16.382 --> 13:19.650
Not many cases of malaria
in this part of the world.

13:19.652 --> 13:21.352
No, you could pretty much count
the number of fatalities

13:21.354 --> 13:22.720
on one hand.

13:22.722 --> 13:24.288
So Hinkley spent quite a bit
of time in West Africa

13:24.290 --> 13:25.789
in the days leading up
to his death,

13:25.791 --> 13:27.258
so he probably contracted
the virus

13:27.260 --> 13:28.893
and it went undetected.

13:28.895 --> 13:31.028
Hmm.

13:31.030 --> 13:33.063
What you thinking, Cap?

13:33.065 --> 13:34.665
I don't know.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.967
Guy dies pretty young.
Very suddenly.

13:36.969 --> 13:38.769
Exotic cause of death.

13:38.771 --> 13:40.204
This might sound
a little strange,

13:40.206 --> 13:42.473
but perhaps there was somebody
in his life that, uh,

13:42.475 --> 13:45.542
wasn't quite ready
to let him go just yet.

13:45.544 --> 13:47.611
You think that somebody missed
Hinkley so much

13:47.613 --> 13:49.446
that they dug up his body?

13:49.448 --> 13:51.815
Just like Norman Bates dug up
his mom?

13:51.817 --> 13:53.984
We've seen stranger.

13:55.788 --> 13:58.022
Okay. Do we know if Hinkley was
involved with anybody?

13:58.024 --> 14:00.024
Uh, no, but we're still looking
into his personal life.

14:00.026 --> 14:01.358
I-In-In the meantime,

14:01.360 --> 14:03.861
CSU, uh, found
tire tracks down

14:03.863 --> 14:05.562
at the crime scene
and the lab matched them

14:05.564 --> 14:07.865
to a late model van
which could belong to our perp.

14:07.867 --> 14:09.733
Okay. Anything else?

14:09.735 --> 14:11.302
Yes, boss is
starting to think

14:11.304 --> 14:14.204
that maybe there was some sort
of creepy religious ritual

14:14.206 --> 14:16.140
that involves digging up
a corpse, so he and Danny

14:16.142 --> 14:18.876
are consulting with an
expert on the macabre.

14:18.878 --> 14:20.044
Lucky for us,

14:20.046 --> 14:21.278
we just happen to have one
in-house.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.746
<i>Sounds weird, I know,</i>

14:22.748 --> 14:25.015
but in certain parts of
the world, digging up the dead

14:25.017 --> 14:26.216
is totally normal.

14:26.218 --> 14:27.618
In the highlands of Madagascar,

14:27.620 --> 14:30.254
there's a thing called the
“Turning of the Bones,” - Ooh.

14:30.256 --> 14:31.588
where villagers unearth their
relatives every seven years,

14:31.590 --> 14:34.391
rewrap them in burial cloth
and dance around with them.

14:34.393 --> 14:36.627
Is this, like, they're
crowd-carrying the corpse?

14:36.629 --> 14:37.928
Looks festive.

14:37.930 --> 14:39.730
There's also the
Ma'nene Festival in Indonesia.

14:39.732 --> 14:41.732
Same idea, only it happens
every three years.

14:41.734 --> 14:43.467
They also change
the cadaver's clothes.

14:43.469 --> 14:45.035
This is fascinating.

14:45.037 --> 14:47.438
It's, uh, disgusting, um,

14:47.440 --> 14:50.040
but we're not in Madagascar
or Indonesia.

14:50.042 --> 14:51.709
Yeah, Jerry, we need to try
to figure out why somebody

14:51.711 --> 14:52.910
would dig up a stiff in Hawaii.

14:52.912 --> 14:55.612
Could be a “Ghost Marriage.”

14:55.614 --> 14:57.448
- I'm sorry, you said “Ghost Marriage”?
- Yeah, it's an ancient ritual

14:57.450 --> 14:58.916
practiced by a small segment

14:58.918 --> 15:00.617
of the Chinese population.

15:00.619 --> 15:03.387
Basically, the idea is you
dig up an unwed dead person

15:03.389 --> 15:06.123
and you pair them with an
unwed recently deceased person,

15:06.125 --> 15:07.358
so they can be married
in the afterlife.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.426
It's like Tinder
for the dead.

15:09.428 --> 15:11.495
Yeah, Jerry, I-I think we need
something grounded,

15:11.497 --> 15:14.932
like a motive grounded
in reality, or, uh...

15:14.934 --> 15:16.734
Haitian Zombie Powder.

15:16.736 --> 15:18.669
Excuse me?

15:18.671 --> 15:20.170
You sprinkle it on a dead body,
you bring it back to life.

15:20.172 --> 15:21.605
Thing is, you need
crushed human skulls

15:21.607 --> 15:23.273
of the recently deceased,

15:23.275 --> 15:25.042
which means a trip to the cemetery.
- Jerry...

15:25.044 --> 15:26.176
Ho-ho-ho-ho. Hold on. Let me...

15:26.178 --> 15:28.645
um... just get this straight.

15:28.647 --> 15:30.614
You think, or you're suggesting,
that our killer,

15:30.616 --> 15:32.583
maybe, uh, he was looking
for ingredients

15:32.585 --> 15:34.551
to make a magic dust to bring
somebody back to life?

15:34.553 --> 15:35.519
We need grounded.

15:35.521 --> 15:38.455
Guys. Grounded. Grounded.

15:38.457 --> 15:41.191
Grounded.
Okay, how about this?

15:41.193 --> 15:43.293
There's an Afro-Caribbean
religion called Santería.

15:43.295 --> 15:44.995
It started in West Africa

15:44.997 --> 15:47.464
but has since spread to
other parts of the world.

15:47.466 --> 15:51.135
Some of its practices include
live animal sacrifice

15:51.137 --> 15:53.137
and the use of human remains.

15:53.139 --> 15:55.572
Now, over the years a few
santeros have been arrested

15:55.574 --> 15:57.274
on the mainland
for digging up bodies

15:57.276 --> 15:58.776
to be used in
healing ceremonies.

15:58.778 --> 16:00.044
Our missing corpse

16:00.046 --> 16:02.146
recently spent time
in West Africa.

16:02.148 --> 16:03.614
This could actually be
something.

16:03.616 --> 16:04.915
So, you actually want

16:04.917 --> 16:07.017
to talk to a santero?
I do.

16:07.019 --> 16:09.486
Jerry, thank you.
I appreciate this. That's good.

16:09.488 --> 16:10.788
Oh, you can keep those.
I got copies.

16:10.790 --> 16:12.689
I don't want that.
Okay.

16:12.691 --> 16:14.091
Oh, by the way,

16:14.093 --> 16:15.592
I've also got binders
of Zombie Powder research.

16:15.594 --> 16:16.894
You want me to send those up
just in case?

16:16.896 --> 16:18.262
No, uh, I think you can--

16:18.264 --> 16:19.797
you know, why don't
you hang onto those?

16:19.799 --> 16:21.198
We're gonna follow up
on the santeros,

16:21.200 --> 16:22.833
and then if it doesn't pan out,
we'll look into

16:22.835 --> 16:25.469
the <i>Night of the Living Dead-ly</i>
angle thing.

16:25.471 --> 16:26.670
Okay? Thanks.

16:26.672 --> 16:28.172
<i>My hunch is</i>

16:28.174 --> 16:29.807
whoever stole
Commander McGarrett

16:29.809 --> 16:30.741
and Detective Williams' tools

16:30.743 --> 16:32.943
most likely fenced them.

16:32.945 --> 16:36.346
And I have a hunch
that your hunch

16:36.348 --> 16:38.816
is correct.
Okay.

16:38.818 --> 16:42.519
So do you know any pawn shops
that take in hot merch?

16:43.789 --> 16:45.756
I might know a few
that don't ask questions

16:45.758 --> 16:47.758
about an item's provenance.

16:48.761 --> 16:50.461
I'll go write
some names down

16:50.463 --> 16:52.262
while you go get
something to eat.

16:52.264 --> 16:53.464
I'm good, thanks.

16:53.466 --> 16:56.266
No. I think you should
go get something to eat.

16:56.268 --> 16:57.534
I'm good.

16:57.536 --> 16:58.936
I had a big breakfast.

16:58.938 --> 17:02.139
Plus, I'm trying
to keep the weight off.

17:06.444 --> 17:08.545
You really don't know
how this works, do you?

17:08.547 --> 17:11.147
Quid pro quo,
bruddah.

17:11.150 --> 17:13.717
That's Latin for
“buy some shrimp,

17:13.719 --> 17:15.919
get some names”"

17:15.921 --> 17:18.021
Ah.

17:19.425 --> 17:21.558
I think I am hungry.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.227
I thought so.

17:23.229 --> 17:26.696
I'll take the, uh,
Kahuku shrimp special.

17:26.699 --> 17:29.066
Good choice.

17:29.068 --> 17:30.434
What else?

17:30.436 --> 17:34.071
Uh... The tacos?

17:34.073 --> 17:35.439
Very tasty.

17:35.441 --> 17:36.874
And?

17:42.248 --> 17:44.181
- This is religious persecution.
- What are you talking about?

17:44.183 --> 17:45.516
It's not religious
persecution.

17:45.518 --> 17:46.817
We went through
your house,

17:46.819 --> 17:48.152
Mr. Ravello.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.087
We found some pretty
disturbing stuff.

17:53.526 --> 17:55.325
Live animal sacrifice
is permitted

17:55.327 --> 17:57.394
under freedom of religion.

17:57.396 --> 17:58.529
Supreme Court said so.

17:58.531 --> 18:01.465
Okay, but, uh, having, uh,
human remains

18:01.467 --> 18:03.300
on an altar in your garage,
that is definitely illegal,

18:03.302 --> 18:05.302
and you should know that,
'cause you were arrested for it

18:05.304 --> 18:06.537
once in Louisiana.

18:06.539 --> 18:08.572
First of all, I was framed
in that case.

18:08.574 --> 18:10.374
Those remains were planted
by neighbors

18:10.376 --> 18:12.142
who were trying to run me
out of town

18:12.144 --> 18:13.844
because they didn't
like my beliefs.

18:13.846 --> 18:14.945
And second,

18:14.947 --> 18:17.147
those are animal bones
on my altar.

18:17.149 --> 18:19.116
Well, the good
news is we have

18:19.118 --> 18:20.551
a, uh, very thorough crime lab

18:20.553 --> 18:22.186
that's gonna tell us exactly
the type of bones they are,

18:22.188 --> 18:24.421
but right now
we want to know,

18:24.423 --> 18:25.522
where were you last night?

18:25.524 --> 18:27.191
I was home.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.525
Yeah.

18:28.527 --> 18:29.693
Can anyone back that up?

18:29.695 --> 18:31.695
No.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.765
HPD just found the van.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.402
Hey. It's registered

18:38.404 --> 18:40.204
to a U.S. Marine
who's currently stationed

18:40.206 --> 18:41.605
over in Afghanistan.

18:41.607 --> 18:43.340
We were able to get
in contact with him

18:43.342 --> 18:45.542
and, uh, he had no idea
that his van had been stolen.

18:45.544 --> 18:47.711
You guys might want to
brace yourselves.

18:49.815 --> 18:51.148
Oh, my God.

19:03.954 --> 19:05.478
Okay, was anything missing?

19:05.479 --> 19:08.350
Any, uh, any organs?
Bones? Tissue?

19:08.351 --> 19:09.584
Doesn't look like it,

19:09.585 --> 19:11.440
but it appears Mr. Hinkley's
large intestine

19:11.441 --> 19:12.640
has been cut open.

19:12.642 --> 19:13.908
So, I assume
it's safe to say

19:13.910 --> 19:16.644
a little alien didn't explode
out of his chest?

19:16.646 --> 19:18.346
Wow. Was that a joke?

19:18.348 --> 19:19.814
Uh, yes, sir.
Commander McGarrett,

19:19.816 --> 19:21.716
uh, said use humor

19:21.718 --> 19:23.150
as a way to combat job stress

19:23.152 --> 19:25.152
and, uh, distasteful
situations.

19:25.154 --> 19:27.755
That's very good. That's good.
I mean, the delivery

19:27.757 --> 19:30.224
was, um, uh, stiff.

19:30.226 --> 19:31.559
Stiff? That's
funny, too.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.561
'Cause we got a stiff
right here, you see?

19:33.563 --> 19:35.296
- The delivery was fine.
- That's not very funny, either.

19:35.298 --> 19:36.497
Gentlemen.

19:36.499 --> 19:38.532
Evidence is degrading here.
Can we continue?

19:38.534 --> 19:39.834
Yes, I'm sorry.

19:39.836 --> 19:41.869
You were saying?

19:41.871 --> 19:43.204
There's obvious
post-mortem work.

19:43.206 --> 19:45.373
Mr. Hinkley's large intestine
has been cut open.

19:45.375 --> 19:46.907
All right, so our killer, uh,

19:46.909 --> 19:49.377
digs this guy up,
slices him open,

19:49.379 --> 19:51.646
and he-he leaves him here.
Why?

19:51.648 --> 19:53.547
Well, clearly we can rule out
body snatching

19:53.549 --> 19:55.850
- for profit, right?
- Santeria.

19:55.852 --> 19:57.852
Maybe Hinkley was a mule.

19:57.854 --> 20:00.221
- As in a drug mule?
- Yeah.

20:00.223 --> 20:01.689
Only he died before
he could deliver

20:01.691 --> 20:03.224
whatever he had
in his system,

20:03.226 --> 20:05.493
so whoever's waiting to
pick it up has no choice

20:05.495 --> 20:07.395
but to dig him up
and get it out.

20:07.397 --> 20:09.363
It's good, but I-I think
it's too much trouble.

20:09.365 --> 20:11.766
You got to rent a van,
he kills a guy, digs up a grave.

20:11.768 --> 20:13.234
It's a lot to
go through. Right?

20:13.236 --> 20:14.802
I agree, I agree,
I don't buy it either.

20:14.804 --> 20:16.337
I mean, most big-time
dealers, they expect to lose

20:16.339 --> 20:17.738
a mule or two here
or there, right?

20:17.740 --> 20:19.173
It's the cost of
doing business.

20:19.175 --> 20:21.108
I mean, maybe he had
something more valuable in him.

20:21.110 --> 20:23.110
I don't know. Right?

20:23.913 --> 20:26.080
Adam. What's up?

20:29.385 --> 20:31.185
Hey.
Hey.

20:31.187 --> 20:32.653
Jessie said no.

20:32.655 --> 20:34.255
We're gonna have to find
someone else.

20:34.257 --> 20:35.823
Well, maybe we give the kid
some time.

20:35.825 --> 20:37.024
We approach her again later on.

20:37.026 --> 20:38.526
I'm not sure we can
afford to wait.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.661
Word is Hideki's looking
to make some big moves.

20:40.663 --> 20:42.697
He'll need soldiers to
do it. We'll never have

20:42.699 --> 20:44.865
a better opportunity to
get someone on the inside.

20:44.867 --> 20:46.267
All right.
Well, just keep me posted

20:46.269 --> 20:48.069
on who you're gonna
approach next, okay?

20:48.071 --> 20:50.304
Will do.

20:50.306 --> 20:52.139
Adam, I need to ask
you a question.

20:52.141 --> 20:54.408
Are you sure...

20:54.410 --> 20:56.277
are you sure
this Hideki guy is worth

20:56.279 --> 20:58.479
all the time and resources
we're putting into him?

20:58.481 --> 21:01.215
Listen, the fact
that he's one of the only bosses

21:01.217 --> 21:02.717
on the island
who's still breathing

21:02.719 --> 21:04.819
tells me he's either working
with this outside crew

21:04.821 --> 21:07.321
we're after, or they left him in
place as part of a larger plan.

21:07.323 --> 21:09.156
And if I'm wrong?

21:09.158 --> 21:11.225
Well, then whoever
we're looking for

21:11.227 --> 21:13.527
will probably come for Hideki
just like they came for Shioma

21:13.529 --> 21:15.763
and the rest. Trust me, Steve.

21:15.765 --> 21:18.032
We got to keep a close eye
on this guy.

21:18.034 --> 21:20.368
All right.

21:22.972 --> 21:25.740
I think I would've remembered
if someone came into my shop

21:25.742 --> 21:27.341
with a bunch of power tools.

21:27.343 --> 21:29.110
No one has.

21:29.112 --> 21:31.746
Maybe they dealt
with one of your employees.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.547
I'm the only one who works here.

21:35.251 --> 21:37.551
Mind if I take a look
at your security tapes?

21:37.553 --> 21:40.020
That?

21:40.022 --> 21:42.089
That doesn't
actually record anything.

21:42.091 --> 21:45.126
It's just a deterrent.

21:45.128 --> 21:47.094
So, just to be clear,
if I pull footage

21:47.096 --> 21:49.330
from that car dealership
across the street,

21:49.332 --> 21:51.532
I'm definitely
not gonna see

21:51.534 --> 21:54.068
anyone dropping by
with power tools?

21:54.070 --> 21:57.738
You're absolutely positive
about that?

22:00.610 --> 22:02.343
I, uh...

22:03.780 --> 22:05.646
I couldn't really say for sure.

22:05.648 --> 22:07.381
I mean, a lot of people
come in and out, you know?

22:07.383 --> 22:09.750
All right.

22:09.752 --> 22:13.287
Two guys came in yesterday.

22:13.289 --> 22:15.256
But I didn't get their name

22:15.258 --> 22:18.159
and I didn't know
those tools were hot, I swear.

22:18.161 --> 22:19.860
Okay, listen,
I don't need names.

22:19.862 --> 22:22.062
Just give me back
the tools, okay?

22:22.064 --> 22:24.598
Um, I don't have them.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.900
What?

22:25.902 --> 22:27.435
I already sold them.

22:27.437 --> 22:29.437
All right.

22:29.439 --> 22:31.305
Well, then,
I'm gonna need the name

22:31.307 --> 22:32.940
of the person
you sold them to.

22:32.942 --> 22:35.042
That, I can get you.

22:39.849 --> 22:42.383
Uh...

22:42.385 --> 22:45.953
are there really, uh, cameras
across the street?

22:45.955 --> 22:48.222
Just get me that name.

22:48.224 --> 22:50.591
Yeah.

22:53.162 --> 22:54.795
Awesome news.
Thank you. All right.

22:54.797 --> 22:56.730
That was Pua. He says
he's got a great lead.

22:56.732 --> 22:58.732
He thinks we may even get the
tools back this afternoon.

22:58.734 --> 23:00.401
That's great. It's still
a mistake on your part,

23:00.403 --> 23:02.069
but that's great.
Whatever. What do we got, guys?

23:02.071 --> 23:03.604
Actually, we got a lead, too.

23:03.606 --> 23:06.040
Uh, lab found a print inside
a pair of latex gloves

23:06.042 --> 23:07.441
that our body snatcher
left behind

23:07.443 --> 23:09.443
in the van, and it
came back to this guy:

23:09.445 --> 23:12.213
Neil Voss.
He's in our system

23:12.215 --> 23:14.114
for petty larceny.
But check this out.

23:14.116 --> 23:16.083
Last year he got picked up
trying to smuggle

23:16.085 --> 23:17.885
uncut diamonds into Canada.

23:17.887 --> 23:19.286
Here's the best part
of the story, though.

23:19.288 --> 23:21.989
So, like Hinkley, this guy
recently spent a lot of time

23:21.991 --> 23:25.426
in West Africa, specifically
Liberia and the Ivory Coast.

23:25.428 --> 23:27.995
All right. Two hot spots
for blood diamonds.

23:27.997 --> 23:29.930
Looks like Voss
and Hinkley were partners.

23:29.932 --> 23:32.433
They tried to bring some stones
into Hawaii.

23:32.435 --> 23:33.601
Unfortunately
for Voss, the goods

23:33.603 --> 23:35.536
were still inside
Hinkley's body when he died.

23:35.538 --> 23:36.904
Meantime, Voss
bides his time

23:36.906 --> 23:38.506
until he can get
to those diamonds,

23:38.508 --> 23:40.474
then jumps on a plane
and bounces out of here, right?

23:40.476 --> 23:41.775
I mean, he must've figured

23:41.777 --> 23:43.811
that Hinkley's body
could stay in that van

23:43.813 --> 23:45.446
at long-term parking
at the airport

23:45.448 --> 23:47.147
for a couple of weeks
without being noticed.

23:47.149 --> 23:48.716
Yeah, I mean, that's
definitely what it looks like,

23:48.718 --> 23:50.050
except for one thing.

23:50.052 --> 23:51.719
While he did have
a plane ticket leaving today,

23:51.721 --> 23:52.786
he never checked in.

23:52.788 --> 23:53.854
Which means
he's probably

23:53.856 --> 23:55.222
still on the island.
Wait a minute.

23:55.224 --> 23:56.757
W-Why would he stick around?

23:56.759 --> 23:58.792
Maybe he, uh, he knew
we were on to him...

23:58.794 --> 24:00.127
...he got spooked.
Oh.

24:00.129 --> 24:03.330
Noelani, she's got something,
Danny.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.600
So, I did my own autopsy
on Mr. Hinkley

24:06.602 --> 24:09.103
and came across something strange.
See this? - Hmm.

24:09.105 --> 24:11.438
This is his intestine.
I recognize that

24:11.440 --> 24:12.973
from the floor of the van.
Right.

24:12.975 --> 24:14.815
But what you probably
didn't notice were these.

24:16.145 --> 24:17.444
Look like suture marks.
They are.

24:17.446 --> 24:18.679
It seems today
wasn't the first time

24:18.681 --> 24:21.115
that Hinkley
had his intestine cut open.

24:21.117 --> 24:22.917
- But this is where it gets interesting.
- Okay.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.351
I pulled his
medical records,

24:24.353 --> 24:27.054
and it turns out he never had
any kind of procedure done

24:27.056 --> 24:29.690
on that organ,
which means these incisions...

24:29.692 --> 24:31.458
Happened after he died.
Exactly.

24:31.460 --> 24:34.161
And since Hinkley
never had an autopsy,

24:34.163 --> 24:36.030
I'm thinking they
were probably done

24:36.032 --> 24:37.598
by the mortician
who prepped the body.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.832
And I can only think
of one reason

24:38.834 --> 24:39.833
why someone would do that.

24:39.835 --> 24:41.835
'Cause the mortician, uh,

24:41.837 --> 24:43.270
thought that there was
something inside of there

24:43.272 --> 24:45.573
that he wanted to get his hands on.
That's why Voss

24:45.575 --> 24:46.774
didn't get on that plane.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.676
Somebody got to the stones
before he did.

24:48.678 --> 24:50.244
Stones?
Yeah, we think Hinkley

24:50.246 --> 24:51.845
was, uh, transporting diamonds.

24:51.847 --> 24:54.615
We have to find that mortician
before Voss does.

25:06.596 --> 25:10.331
♪ Girls, take it
right back down ♪

25:10.333 --> 25:12.099
♪ Boys, they come and go... ♪

25:12.101 --> 25:14.201
Hey. You know where Koa is?

25:14.203 --> 25:17.137
- Who?
- The kid who started work this morning.

25:17.139 --> 25:19.039
Haven't seen him.

25:21.143 --> 25:24.111
All right.

25:49.338 --> 25:52.272
Hey, Koa, it's Adam.
You in there?

25:55.478 --> 25:57.511
Oh, my God.
Koa, hey.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.347
Koa! Can you hear me?

26:00.349 --> 26:02.282
Hey, Eli, come quick!

26:02.284 --> 26:03.651
I need some help over here!

26:03.653 --> 26:06.353
Come on, help! Help, help!

26:07.189 --> 26:08.489
Wake up.

26:08.491 --> 26:10.024
Hey. Wake up, Koa! Koa!

26:16.607 --> 26:19.896
Koa, wake up! Hey.
Hey, I need some help! Come on!

26:21.836 --> 26:24.236
Adam, what the hell happened?

26:24.238 --> 26:25.904
I found him passed out.

26:25.906 --> 26:27.172
Call an ambulance.

26:27.174 --> 26:29.241
No. No, there's no time.
Help me get him in the car.

26:29.243 --> 26:30.976
Come on, let's go.

26:34.749 --> 26:37.316
All right.

26:49.330 --> 26:51.764
Come on, pick up, pick up.
Pick up.

26:52.666 --> 26:55.434
Come on, pick up.

26:55.436 --> 26:57.669
Dr. Cunha.

26:57.671 --> 26:59.772
Noelani, it's Adam Noshimuri.
I've got Koa Rey

26:59.774 --> 27:01.206
with me. He's in trouble.
I think he's OD'd.

27:01.208 --> 27:02.841
Is he conscious?

27:02.843 --> 27:04.143
Just barely.

27:04.145 --> 27:06.011
- How long has he been out?
- I don't know.

27:06.013 --> 27:07.479
I found him passed out
a few minutes ago.

27:07.481 --> 27:09.414
- Do you know what he took?
- No, I don't.

27:09.416 --> 27:11.817
- Okay, uh, how far are you from a hospital?
- No, can't do a hospital.

27:11.819 --> 27:13.585
If I take him there, that
gets the cops involved.

27:13.587 --> 27:14.820
Besides, I'm closer to you.

27:14.822 --> 27:17.256
- You're bringing him here?
- Yeah.

27:17.258 --> 27:19.558
I'll be out front
in two minutes.

27:20.961 --> 27:22.294
All right, I'll meet you.

27:23.364 --> 27:24.963
Hang in there.

27:37.444 --> 27:39.244
Pulse is faint.

27:40.481 --> 27:41.947
Search his pockets.

27:44.552 --> 27:45.984
He's barely breathing.

27:50.424 --> 27:52.157
I got something.

27:53.794 --> 27:56.094
Those are probably opiates.

27:56.096 --> 27:57.563
He doesn't have much time.

28:04.171 --> 28:06.038
What is that?

28:06.040 --> 28:08.941
Naloxone. It reverses
the effects of an overdose.

28:10.311 --> 28:11.476
Is it working?

28:11.478 --> 28:12.978
The effects are usually instant.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.847
He's gonna need another dose.

28:22.289 --> 28:23.889
All right, come on, man.

28:23.891 --> 28:26.525
Come on, man. You got this.

28:48.349 --> 28:50.115
Mr. Rice? Five-O.

29:01.528 --> 29:04.062
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

29:04.798 --> 29:06.198
Where's Voss?

29:06.200 --> 29:07.633
He's on his way to my house.

29:07.635 --> 29:09.434
The diamonds at your house?
Yeah.

29:09.436 --> 29:11.670
Get HPD over there.

29:12.306 --> 29:13.772
My wife is there, too.

29:16.176 --> 29:18.377
Who is it?

29:20.447 --> 29:22.814
Delivery, Mrs. Rice.
It's from your husband.

29:22.816 --> 29:24.816
Oh.

29:28.689 --> 29:31.356
Afternoon, Mrs. Rice.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.208
You're stalling.

29:56.210 --> 29:58.077
I'm not, I swear.

29:58.079 --> 30:00.012
Please, I'm just nervous.

30:00.014 --> 30:02.348
Sooner you get this done,
the sooner I'm out of here.

30:09.423 --> 30:11.457
Open it.

30:11.459 --> 30:13.626
Let me see.

30:21.302 --> 30:24.069
All right, down on the floor. Do it.

30:24.071 --> 30:25.771
You're gonna

30:25.773 --> 30:28.374
stay down here and count
to a hundred, you got me?

30:28.376 --> 30:29.808
Mm-hmm.

30:55.269 --> 30:57.136
Neil Voss!

30:57.138 --> 30:58.270
Get out of the car
right now.

30:58.272 --> 31:00.306
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

31:02.710 --> 31:04.677
Right now!

31:12.253 --> 31:13.552
Gun!

31:21.362 --> 31:24.463
Grover, take Junior.

31:24.465 --> 31:25.864
Go check on
Mrs. Rice.

31:33.574 --> 31:34.907
Look at that.

31:34.909 --> 31:36.208
Are those...?

31:36.210 --> 31:37.543
Yeah.

31:37.545 --> 31:39.478
Diamonds. Must've swallowed 'em.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.351
That's how he was gonna
get 'em off the island.

31:41.375 --> 31:42.349
Yeah, well, short of

31:42.350 --> 31:44.450
a full body scan at the airport,
he might have

31:44.452 --> 31:46.719
got away with it, too.

31:49.523 --> 31:51.724
Hey.

32:08.542 --> 32:10.542
He's gonna be fine.

32:10.544 --> 32:13.278
Thank you.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.680
Adam...
Hey.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.849
It's okay.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.155
We'll give you guys
a few minutes, all right?

32:44.278 --> 32:46.712
You are so lucky
that they brought you here.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.614
Do you get that?

32:48.616 --> 32:50.582
If the cops got
involved...

32:50.584 --> 32:52.685
I know.

32:52.687 --> 32:54.953
Yeah.

33:13.474 --> 33:16.108
H-How long have you been using?

33:17.478 --> 33:20.179
About a year.

33:23.718 --> 33:26.685
You need help.
You're going to rehab.

33:30.257 --> 33:32.224
Look, I...

33:32.226 --> 33:33.859
I get it, okay?

33:33.861 --> 33:36.328
I was... I was stupid.

33:36.330 --> 33:38.330
It won't happen again. I'm...

33:38.332 --> 33:40.399
I'm done with that stuff.

33:40.401 --> 33:42.067
You can't even look at me.

33:43.070 --> 33:46.505
You should have died today.

33:49.276 --> 33:50.676
I promised Dad, I promised him.

33:50.678 --> 33:52.845
I promised him
that I'd look after you.

33:52.847 --> 33:56.482
I'm not a kid, all right?

33:56.484 --> 33:59.918
You're not a man, either!

34:02.690 --> 34:04.690
What are you doing, huh?

34:04.692 --> 34:06.358
What are you doing, Koa?

34:06.360 --> 34:09.094
Huh? What are you doing?

34:10.297 --> 34:12.231
You're stealing.

34:12.233 --> 34:16.034
You're rolling with bangers,
you're getting high.

34:17.471 --> 34:20.371
This isn't you. You
weren't like this.

34:21.842 --> 34:24.109
Now, where
you're headed,

34:24.110 --> 34:28.179
you're gonna end up in jail,
or you're gonna end up dead.

34:28.181 --> 34:30.581
Do you understand that?

34:30.583 --> 34:33.918
You are my only family.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.920
You are the only thing I have.

34:35.922 --> 34:38.123
You can't leave me.

34:41.328 --> 34:44.563
I'm sorry.

34:46.934 --> 34:48.900
I'm sorry.

35:13.828 --> 35:15.828
Aloha.

35:15.830 --> 35:19.932
Aloha. Kapula Sugimoto?

35:19.934 --> 35:22.134
Officer Pua Kai.

35:22.136 --> 35:24.670
Can I help you?

35:32.012 --> 35:35.848
- Was this from that wildfire last year?
- Yeah.

35:35.850 --> 35:38.450
It's taking forever
to get the insurance money,

35:38.452 --> 35:40.752
and we got nowhere else to go,
so I told the kids,

35:40.754 --> 35:44.089
“Hey, let's pitch a tent and
live off the land for a while.”

35:44.091 --> 35:47.192
I figured we could do
the repair work ourselves.

35:47.194 --> 35:51.263
Yeah, it's a good thing
you have the tools.

35:51.265 --> 35:53.565
Well, actually,
we just bought them. Used.

35:53.567 --> 35:55.801
- Ah.
- I couldn't afford new ones.

35:55.803 --> 35:57.569
Good deal, too.

35:57.571 --> 35:59.471
But anyway, what's going on?

35:59.473 --> 36:00.806
Is the noise too loud?

36:00.808 --> 36:03.008
No.

36:12.052 --> 36:14.219
So what's the problem?

36:18.025 --> 36:19.458
This tastes like a shoe.

36:19.460 --> 36:20.826
It's strange.
No, it's simple and good.

36:20.828 --> 36:22.794
Nothing wrong with your salad.
It's a good salad.

36:22.796 --> 36:24.129
Oh!
What?

36:24.131 --> 36:26.865
So there he is.
Hey, Pua! Buddy!

36:28.002 --> 36:29.001
What's going on?

36:29.003 --> 36:30.435
What, uh... what's up
with the tools?

36:30.437 --> 36:31.737
Well...

36:31.739 --> 36:34.006
Uh-oh.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.910
I-I'm... I'm sorry,
Detective, Commander,

36:37.912 --> 36:39.811
but we hit a wall.

36:39.813 --> 36:42.214
Those tools are probably
off-island by now.

36:42.216 --> 36:43.348
Hey.

36:43.350 --> 36:44.650
What happened to our
very promising lead?

36:44.652 --> 36:45.884
Yeah...

36:45.886 --> 36:49.121
The... Turns out
it was a dead-end.

36:49.123 --> 36:51.023
Man.

36:51.025 --> 36:52.958
I-I'm really sorry.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.161
You know, the last thing I
wanted was to let you guys down.

36:56.163 --> 36:57.863
No, no, no, come on.
It's okay. Look,

36:57.865 --> 37:00.165
we-we really appreciate
you getting into it for us,

37:00.167 --> 37:02.334
and, uh, it's fine.
I'll-I'll

37:02.336 --> 37:03.802
keep working the case.
It's cool.

37:03.804 --> 37:04.970
I'll make... make sure...

37:04.972 --> 37:06.638
I'll let you know any progress.
Yeah.

37:06.640 --> 37:07.673
Thank you, Pua.

37:07.675 --> 37:08.607
Thanks, Pua.
Yeah.

37:08.609 --> 37:10.876
Thank you.

37:10.878 --> 37:12.077
Man.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.247
All right.

37:15.249 --> 37:17.049
Guess I'm going
to City Mill tomorrow

37:17.051 --> 37:18.884
and get some new tools.
Oh, hold on.

37:18.886 --> 37:20.018
Hold on. Stop.
Going to cash...

37:20.020 --> 37:21.153
Stop. Okay?
What? What? What?!

37:21.155 --> 37:23.722
We got to think and
reassess a little bit.

37:23.724 --> 37:26.825
Maybe it's time to reevaluate,

37:26.827 --> 37:30.028
assess a couple of things. Uh...

37:30.030 --> 37:31.430
We're way behind
where we should be,

37:31.432 --> 37:33.332
and I think maybe
we need to...

37:33.334 --> 37:35.834
I don't know-- talk a little bit
about some stuff. - What?

37:35.836 --> 37:37.936
Well, we're way behind. You keep
fighting me on the aesthetic.

37:37.938 --> 37:39.271
I mean, the booze and this.

37:39.273 --> 37:40.973
- Then we've had a bunch of setbacks.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

37:40.975 --> 37:43.075
We were both in quarantine, you
got shot, you broke your arm.

37:43.077 --> 37:45.043
I mean... - I broke my... Well,
you bought a phony cheap ladder.

37:45.045 --> 37:47.746
Nah. Nah. - That's why I broke...
but that's not the point, okay?

37:47.748 --> 37:49.748
That's not the point.
The point is,

37:49.750 --> 37:52.017
we are spending
way too much money,

37:52.019 --> 37:54.920
we're not even close
to opening,

37:54.922 --> 37:56.521
and I think that maybe the way

37:56.523 --> 37:58.323
we are going about this
is not working.

37:58.325 --> 38:00.025
- Would you agree with that?
- Wait a minute. Hold on.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.194
Hold on. What are
you trying to say?

38:02.196 --> 38:04.262
Are you saying that we
made a mistake with this?

38:04.264 --> 38:06.231
No, I didn't say
it was a mistake.

38:06.233 --> 38:08.533
I said that maybe
we could use a little help.

38:08.535 --> 38:10.635
A little help? You
want to hire somebody?

38:10.637 --> 38:12.471
You just said we
don't have any money.

38:12.473 --> 38:14.072
I didn't say “hire.”
I said maybe we just,

38:14.074 --> 38:15.841
you know, maybe bring-bring in
another partner, so...

38:15.843 --> 38:19.011
Whoa. That's the worst
idea you've ever had.

38:19.013 --> 38:20.846
Another voice in this?

38:20.848 --> 38:22.280
Danny, come on. Besides,

38:22.282 --> 38:24.449
the Steve's is-is supposed
to be our thing, you know?

38:24.451 --> 38:26.885
Mm.
Listen to me. Please, would you listen to me?

38:26.887 --> 38:29.221
I'm gonna figure it out,
all right? We'll get a loan,

38:29.223 --> 38:30.856
we'll borrow some money,
whatever. I don't know.

38:30.858 --> 38:32.924
But we're gonna get it,
we're gonna figure it out.

38:32.926 --> 38:35.427
It's gonna be awesome,
all right? Come on, okay?

38:35.429 --> 38:36.928
Okay.
All right.

38:36.930 --> 38:37.574
All right.

38:37.598 --> 38:39.743
You do know you left that door
unlocked, though, right?

38:39.767 --> 38:42.067
You need to know that.
Uh, that's not...

38:42.069 --> 38:46.338
You were inside.
That's why I left it open.

39:03.891 --> 39:05.624
About time.

39:06.788 --> 39:08.688
How'd you know where I live?

39:08.690 --> 39:10.417
Let's just say
I'm resourceful.

39:12.189 --> 39:13.322
You know, a while back,

39:13.324 --> 39:15.757
I pulled a couple of jobs
with this guy.

39:15.759 --> 39:18.961
A real badass, not someone
you'd want to mess with.

39:18.963 --> 39:21.563
Guy's name was
Michael Noshimuri.

39:23.567 --> 39:25.000
Your brother, right?

39:25.002 --> 39:27.069
Yeah.

39:27.071 --> 39:28.837
What you said before,

39:28.839 --> 39:31.073
about growing up
with some bad people,

39:31.075 --> 39:33.875
knowing how they think?

39:33.877 --> 39:35.911
I thought that was all smoke.

39:37.181 --> 39:38.914
Guess I was wrong about you.

39:38.916 --> 39:40.515
Where is Michael

39:40.517 --> 39:42.084
these days?

39:43.287 --> 39:44.786
No, no, no!

39:51.762 --> 39:54.129
He's dead.

39:54.965 --> 39:57.265
I'm sorry.

39:58.602 --> 39:59.768
How?

39:59.770 --> 40:02.804
I killed him.

40:02.806 --> 40:04.439
I didn't have
a choice.

40:04.441 --> 40:06.775
It was either
him or me.

40:10.381 --> 40:12.748
If I do this thing...

40:12.750 --> 40:14.983
am I gonna end up dead?

40:14.985 --> 40:18.186
I won't let that happen.

40:18.188 --> 40:21.289
I'll protect you.
You have my word.

40:27.364 --> 40:30.365
All right, Noshimuri.

40:30.367 --> 40:32.534
You got yourself a CI.
