00:25.214 --> 00:27.339
I'm a human spray bottle!

00:27.369 --> 00:29.162
Kids, just 'cause
your father's not here,

00:29.192 --> 00:31.100
doesn't mean you can
spit-shine the tables.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.872
Is Dad ever coming back?

00:32.902 --> 00:34.493
I don't know
if it means anything,

00:34.523 --> 00:36.398
but when he kissed me good-bye
this morning,

00:36.428 --> 00:39.339
he said "Goodbye Louise! I'll
never ever see you again!"

00:39.369 --> 00:41.220
He's just at
the dentist, Louise.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.668
Dr. Yap is dreamy.
When he's looking at my molars,

00:43.698 --> 00:46.174
it's like he's
looking right into my soul.

00:46.204 --> 00:47.980
Well I'm glad you like
the dentist, Tina,

00:48.010 --> 00:49.718
but your father doesn't
feel the same way.

00:49.748 --> 00:51.523
Getting him there
is like pulling teeth.

00:51.553 --> 00:53.020
Get it?!

00:54.796 --> 00:57.406
I don't like the OK of you.

00:57.436 --> 00:59.579
"You can trust me, Bob."

00:59.609 --> 01:00.481
Yeah, but what about your
friend?

01:00.511 --> 01:01.902
He looks really scary.

01:01.932 --> 01:03.506
I'm-a cut ya.

01:03.536 --> 01:05.712
Dr. Yap will be
right with you.

01:05.742 --> 01:08.169
Okay. Don't touch
the instruments. They're sterile.

01:08.199 --> 01:10.241
So, it's okay, we're friends.
No, it's not okay.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.113
You're not supposed
to touch the instruments.

01:12.143 --> 01:14.581
I was being serious.
Right, right, I'm sorry, yeah. Of course.

01:14.611 --> 01:16.701
Those aren't their voices.
I know.

01:17.491 --> 01:19.714
Guess who's on new meds!

01:19.780 --> 01:22.525
Gayle! What a surprise!

01:22.555 --> 01:24.255
Look, kids,
your Aunt Gayle is here.

01:24.309 --> 01:26.252
Oh, my God.
You didn't even call.

01:26.282 --> 01:27.907
Who does that?
Just you.

01:27.937 --> 01:29.659
And she brought a suitcase.

01:29.708 --> 01:31.683
This is the first stop

01:31.713 --> 01:34.648
on my Eat, Pray, Love
trip around the world.

01:34.722 --> 01:36.196
All right!

01:36.226 --> 01:38.035
Aunt Gayle got her
groove back... sexy.

01:38.065 --> 01:41.243
I'll only be here for a few
days, on my way to Indonesia.

01:41.273 --> 01:43.015
Or maybe just home again

01:43.045 --> 01:44.945
and order Indonesian take-out.

01:45.017 --> 01:47.227
All right, well, let me
take your stuff upstairs.

01:47.257 --> 01:48.630
You can stay in Tina's room.

01:48.660 --> 01:50.235
We can stay up
all night gossiping.

01:50.265 --> 01:51.598
What's up with Linda lately?

01:51.668 --> 01:53.176
Wait, I brought gifts!

01:53.206 --> 01:55.040
I picked them out
at a truck stop.

01:55.111 --> 01:57.345
For you Tina, a cassette tape.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.493
The original motion picture
soundtrack to Milk.

01:59.523 --> 02:00.957
Cool.

02:01.028 --> 02:04.307
And for Louise...
four-hour energy drink.

02:04.337 --> 02:05.621
I saved you the last 45 minutes.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.432
Thank you!

02:07.462 --> 02:10.030
And finally, for Gene,
a jawbreaker.

02:10.103 --> 02:11.761
I got candy!

02:11.791 --> 02:13.425
No fair!

02:13.496 --> 02:16.189
I'll challenge you for it.
What kind of challenge?

02:16.219 --> 02:18.011
Why don't you guys have a hug-of-war?
Done!

02:18.041 --> 02:20.551
No, wait, wait! That's not fair!
I love you! I love you!

02:20.581 --> 02:22.323
We can't use strength in this!
Meh.

02:22.353 --> 02:25.315
Whoever makes the grossest drink
gets the jawbreaker.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.153
Tina, you'll be the judge.
Okay.

02:27.183 --> 02:28.183
Yeah.

02:36.760 --> 02:40.489
♪ Doo-wah, a little bit of butter, a little
bit of dirt ♪ ♪ Little bit of dirt, whoo ♪

02:40.519 --> 02:41.642
Hey.
I need that!

02:41.672 --> 02:43.197
Stop it!
Give it back!

02:43.227 --> 02:44.702
Bob's at the dentist today,

02:44.732 --> 02:46.621
so I got to watch
the kids and the restaurant.

02:46.670 --> 02:48.043
Well, why don't I take 'em

02:48.073 --> 02:49.781
and go pick up Bob
when he's ready?

02:49.811 --> 02:52.089
I've always wanted
to drive a car.

02:52.119 --> 02:53.759
Oh, thank you!

02:53.789 --> 02:55.924
Ah, the new Gayle is happy
and helpful... I love it.

02:58.536 --> 03:00.679
The use of dust from
the floor was risky,

03:00.709 --> 03:01.681
but it paid off.

03:01.711 --> 03:02.684
I almost threw up.

03:02.714 --> 03:03.714
Louise wins.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.810
Yes!

03:05.840 --> 03:07.324
Mmm!

03:08.931 --> 03:10.406
Hey, there, Bob.
Ready to party?

03:10.436 --> 03:12.086
Yeah.

03:12.157 --> 03:14.400
Ugh, what a day.
What happened?

03:14.430 --> 03:16.405
I had a patient in here earlier

03:16.435 --> 03:18.711
and I accidentally stuck a
needle through his cheek.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.676
Just... I hate Mondays.
Oh...

03:20.747 --> 03:22.187
Uh, no, wait, wait, wait!

03:22.217 --> 03:24.093
Uh, wait, Dr. Yap,
what is that?

03:24.123 --> 03:25.724
Oh, that?
That's Greta.

03:25.795 --> 03:27.619
What'd you say, Greta?
Huh? You ticklish?

03:27.649 --> 03:29.608
You're ticklish?
You want me tickle you?

03:29.638 --> 03:31.146
You want me tickle you?!

03:31.176 --> 03:33.296
You have a really great
relationship with your guitar.

03:38.931 --> 03:41.391
Ah, no, wait, wait, wait.
What's, uh...

03:41.421 --> 03:44.867
What's that?
Oh, that's me at my $30,000 time share.

03:44.897 --> 03:46.571
I own it with
six other families.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.259
Three times out of the year,

03:48.289 --> 03:50.098
I can go up there
any time I want to.

03:50.128 --> 03:52.972
That sounds amaz...
Wait, wait! What's that?

03:53.002 --> 03:56.148
That, my friend, is my latest
graduation medallion...

03:56.178 --> 03:57.919
from The Persuasion Arts.

03:57.949 --> 03:59.992
It's the ancient art
of picking up women.

04:00.022 --> 04:02.657
We follow The Prince of
Persuasia's three-step program,

04:02.729 --> 04:05.140
and it works!
The Prince of Persuasia?

04:05.170 --> 04:06.894
Mm-hmm. He's a prophet.

04:06.924 --> 04:09.552
And for three payments of $900,
he can be your best friend.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.340
$900?

04:11.370 --> 04:13.680
That's right, Bob.
Your negligent flossing habits

04:13.710 --> 04:16.116
are funding my
one way ticket to Pound Town.

04:16.183 --> 04:17.997
Yeah. Well, I... Ow!

04:18.071 --> 04:19.846
I'll tell you all about it

04:19.877 --> 04:21.644
when you get back
from Snooze City.

04:21.714 --> 04:23.483
Pound Town...

04:23.553 --> 04:25.128
I don't wanna see Pound Town.

04:25.158 --> 04:27.376
♪ Town of the pound... ♪

04:30.673 --> 04:33.350
Hello, Dr. Yap.
Hi, Dr. Yap.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.628
Oh, hey, Dr. Yap.
Funny running into you here.

04:35.686 --> 04:38.732
Hello, Belcher children
and lady I don't know.

04:38.762 --> 04:40.435
I'm Bob's sister-in-law Gayle.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.678
Bob never mentioned he had a
semi-attractive sister-in-law.

04:43.708 --> 04:47.545
Thank you. Bob never
mentioned he had a dentist.

04:50.662 --> 04:52.629
He's in Room One.

05:02.711 --> 05:03.711
Hey, baby.

05:07.357 --> 05:08.471
You look funny.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.483
Did you bring any honey

05:09.513 --> 05:11.238
for these biscuits?

05:11.268 --> 05:12.508
Oh!

05:12.538 --> 05:14.046
Oh, it's been a long time

05:14.076 --> 05:16.110
since my pillows got fluffed.

05:16.181 --> 05:18.883
You're stupid.
Let's go home.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.571
For Christmas,
I want to get Dr. Yap

05:23.601 --> 05:26.480
a subscription to Highlights.
He loves that magazine.

05:26.510 --> 05:27.850
I'm gonna get him
some laughing gas

05:27.880 --> 05:29.939
from my private tank.

05:29.969 --> 05:32.898
I'm gonna give him my business,
from all this jaw breaking.

05:32.928 --> 05:35.251
Mm...

05:39.195 --> 05:41.380
Come on, baby, give me a smooch.

05:41.468 --> 05:43.065
Oh, we shouldn't...

05:46.782 --> 05:49.828
Your tongue feels so much
different than my cat's.

05:49.858 --> 05:53.889
I guess we could go around
the block one more time.

05:53.919 --> 05:55.560
Wait a second, ah...

05:55.590 --> 05:56.857
Whoo!

06:04.402 --> 06:06.469
Aah! Gayle!
What are you doing here?

06:06.525 --> 06:07.998
I can't believe
we did that, Bob.

06:08.028 --> 06:09.888
That was a huge mistake.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.341
We can't do it again.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.595
Although we both want to.

06:12.625 --> 06:13.776
What are you talking about?

06:13.828 --> 06:16.238
She's my sister, Bob!

06:16.268 --> 06:18.135
Linda can never know.

06:18.206 --> 06:20.316
Know what?
You don't remember?

06:20.346 --> 06:22.715
We made love.
What?!

06:22.752 --> 06:24.219
With our mouths.

06:24.290 --> 06:26.065
W-Wait a minute.
We kissed?

06:26.095 --> 06:27.836
Yes, Bob.
In the car.

06:27.866 --> 06:30.544
After you fondled my buttocks
at the dentist's office.

06:30.574 --> 06:32.008
But Linda picked me up
from the...

06:33.599 --> 06:35.483
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

06:35.554 --> 06:37.096
Oh, God...

06:37.126 --> 06:39.294
All these years, Bob,

06:39.364 --> 06:41.490
you could only keep
those feelings

06:41.520 --> 06:43.312
bottled up for so long.

06:43.342 --> 06:45.468
Now... you're my boyfriend.

06:45.498 --> 06:46.973
Oh, God. Listen, Gayle,

06:47.003 --> 06:48.620
I was heavily drugged, okay?

06:48.691 --> 06:50.432
Tell no one.
Wait, no, no.

06:50.462 --> 06:52.939
Gayle? Gayle?!
Oh, no...

06:52.969 --> 06:54.869
What do I tell Linda?
Nothing.

06:56.011 --> 06:57.345
Mmm...

06:57.414 --> 06:59.524
Mm!

06:59.554 --> 07:01.104
Okay, new challenge!

07:01.175 --> 07:03.283
Whoever can listen to
Teddy tell that story

07:03.313 --> 07:05.523
about his wel's the longest
wins the jawbreaker.

07:05.553 --> 07:07.521
Okay, I'm game.

07:07.592 --> 07:10.187
Hi Teddy. What was that
thing you were saying

07:10.217 --> 07:12.225
the other day,
about your towels?

07:12.255 --> 07:14.498
Oh, about how I
noticed my two towels

07:14.528 --> 07:15.928
were slightly different colours?

07:15.999 --> 07:17.439
Fascinating.
Uh-huh.

07:17.469 --> 07:18.810
Right, and I was thinking,

07:18.840 --> 07:20.534
were they the same colour
when I bought them?

07:20.564 --> 07:22.762
Or have I washed one more
than the other over the years?

07:22.792 --> 07:23.707
Great! That's it, huh?

07:23.737 --> 07:25.194
No, go on. There's more.
What?

07:25.224 --> 07:26.498
Well, what do I do now?

07:26.528 --> 07:27.805
Do I wash the other one
intensely

07:27.835 --> 07:29.389
to get it to match?

07:29.419 --> 07:31.257
Do I return them?
Do I pretend I never noticed?

07:31.287 --> 07:33.083
Can I still use them
as guest towels?

07:33.113 --> 07:34.954
When am I gonna have guests?
I don't know.

07:34.984 --> 07:36.586
I don't know!
What do I do?

07:38.227 --> 07:40.224
You bought some at an
estate sale once, didn't you?

07:40.254 --> 07:41.432
Oh, no, he didn't!

07:41.503 --> 07:42.876
Oh, did I tell you about that?

07:42.906 --> 07:44.474
No! You win!

07:45.824 --> 07:47.100
I'll wait till Louise gets back.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.947
She loves my stories.

07:50.510 --> 07:51.885
Lin, we need to talk.

07:51.915 --> 07:53.982
Something happened
earlier today.

07:54.054 --> 07:56.229
I know.
You went to the dentist.

07:56.259 --> 07:58.160
I'm so proud of my
little Bobby Baby Teeth.

07:58.232 --> 08:00.023
Linda, I kissed your sister.
I was on drugs

08:00.053 --> 08:01.928
that the dentist gave me

08:01.958 --> 08:04.116
and I-I thought it was you,
and now, your sister thinks

08:04.146 --> 08:05.426
we're going steady or something.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.210
That...

08:07.240 --> 08:08.380
is...

08:08.410 --> 08:10.095
wonderful!

08:10.148 --> 08:11.248
Y-You're not upset?

08:11.318 --> 08:13.293
No, I'm not upset.

08:13.323 --> 08:15.734
Gayle is finally feeling
happier and healthier,

08:15.764 --> 08:17.761
and you want to give her
whatever she needs, Bobby.

08:17.791 --> 08:19.227
Whatever she needs?!

08:19.257 --> 08:21.094
What if, what if she wants
to have sex with me?

08:21.124 --> 08:22.401
Whatever she needs.

08:22.431 --> 08:24.173
Sex?!
Gayle's always wanted whatever I had.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.979
I let her believe
she was "dating"

08:26.009 --> 08:28.652
my high school boyfriend
Carl for three years.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.443
Three years?!
And after she dated Carl,

08:31.473 --> 08:33.666
she had the confidence
to go after Vinny.

08:33.696 --> 08:35.972
I totally lost.
You're Carl.

08:36.001 --> 08:38.964
And, eventually, she'll find
herself another Vinny.

08:38.994 --> 08:40.301
Now go get cleaned up
for dinner.

08:40.331 --> 08:41.972
You have to look nice.

08:42.003 --> 08:43.820
♪ I know
someone who likes you. ♪

08:45.495 --> 08:48.991
So, Gayle, are you
seeing anyone right now?

08:49.038 --> 08:50.372
Funny you should ask.

08:50.443 --> 08:52.694
I actually just met someone.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.867
I feel like a teenager again.

08:54.937 --> 08:56.538
Except my breasts
are more even now.

08:56.608 --> 08:58.401
- Uh...
- It's like biting into

08:58.431 --> 08:59.905
a piece of forbidden fruit...

08:59.935 --> 09:01.343
unwashed fruit...

09:01.373 --> 09:02.723
so dirty...

09:02.793 --> 09:04.293
This isn't happening.

09:04.364 --> 09:05.721
I mustn't, I mustn't,

09:05.751 --> 09:07.919
but I mustn't not.

09:07.957 --> 09:09.958
Linda, hallway, now.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.175
She had her toes on my crotch.

09:13.205 --> 09:14.612
I can't do this anymore, Lin.

09:14.642 --> 09:16.083
No, no, this is working.

09:16.113 --> 09:18.114
Now let's go have dessert.

09:18.185 --> 09:20.128
Who wants cookie dough
ice cream?!

09:20.158 --> 09:21.181
Me!
Yay!

09:21.211 --> 09:24.055

That's funny.
So, you got any plans this weekend?

09:58.379 --> 10:01.992
Well, I have a family, so I don't really
make plans. Yeah, I was gonna go up to my

10:02.022 --> 10:04.934
time share in the mountains;
I invited my new hygienist.

10:04.964 --> 10:07.006
But she can't come.
And she quit.

10:07.036 --> 10:08.511
You guys could go up
if you want.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.048
You practically
paid for half of it.

10:10.078 --> 10:11.719
Ah, no. No, thanks.

10:11.749 --> 10:13.524
Besides, my wife's sister
is in town, so...

10:13.554 --> 10:15.363
Oh, you mean the amateur
brunette mature

10:15.393 --> 10:17.034
that picked you up?

10:17.064 --> 10:19.674
I'd let that happen.
Wait! Yes!

10:19.704 --> 10:22.984
You're Vinny!
Let's go skiing! Allf us:

10:23.014 --> 10:24.956
You, Gayle, everyone!
Boom.

10:24.986 --> 10:27.195
Yes, boom!
What about kids?

10:27.225 --> 10:28.967
Can you handle some kids?
Hell, yeah.

10:28.997 --> 10:30.705
It's biologically proven that

10:30.735 --> 10:33.813
children lead to sexual
intercourse and vice versa.

10:33.843 --> 10:35.735
♪ Children
lead to intercourse. ♪

10:35.765 --> 10:37.240
Hm, I wouldn't
phrase it like that.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.487
Really? You wouldn't?

10:41.247 --> 10:44.225
The jawbreaker may be going
up the mountain with you,

10:44.255 --> 10:46.281
but it is coming down with me.

10:46.311 --> 10:48.103
What was that, Louise?

10:48.133 --> 10:50.501
I couldn't hear you with
my jawbreaker in my ear.

10:50.572 --> 10:53.367
Get it out of there!
Rubby-rub, ear, ear.

10:53.397 --> 10:55.657
Hey, enough! We're Dr. Yap's
guests for the night,

10:55.687 --> 10:57.244
so behave, or else.

10:57.274 --> 10:58.882
Yeah, don't embarrass me.

10:58.912 --> 11:00.604
Let's just act
like a normal family

11:00.634 --> 11:02.309
on vacation with
their sexy dentist.

11:02.339 --> 11:03.722
Yeah...

11:07.186 --> 11:09.004
Oop! Watch your face!

11:09.057 --> 11:10.632
Look at that.
It's working already.

11:10.662 --> 11:11.868
I told you.

11:11.898 --> 11:13.339
You make her feel good
about herself

11:13.369 --> 11:14.876
and she's Dr. Yap's problem.

11:14.906 --> 11:16.381
Your work is done.

11:16.411 --> 11:18.219
So no more kissing
my sister, you.

11:18.249 --> 11:19.472
What? Huh?
Hmm?

11:19.502 --> 11:20.793
Um, that's an expression for...

11:20.823 --> 11:22.297
peeing in the shower.

11:22.327 --> 11:23.994
I'm not gonna pee in
the shower anymore.

11:24.065 --> 11:26.859
Why? Why doesn't he get to do that?
Yeah.

11:26.889 --> 11:27.996
Yeah, that's true. Why can't I?
And why bring it up now?

11:28.026 --> 11:29.500
It goes right down the drain.

11:29.530 --> 11:31.281
You know what?
Let's all kiss our sister.

11:35.179 --> 11:37.714
It seems like you and Dr. Yap
are really hitting it off.

11:37.786 --> 11:39.563
You planned the perfect cover

11:39.595 --> 11:41.597
for us to have
a romantic getaway.

11:41.637 --> 11:43.588
What? No. No cover. No.

11:43.663 --> 11:45.338
You pretend to flirt with Linda,

11:45.370 --> 11:47.314
I'll fake-flirt
with Dr. Yap

11:47.346 --> 11:49.323
and then we can sneak off
and hit the slopes...

11:49.355 --> 11:51.184
my slopes!

11:55.768 --> 11:58.313
Let there be light.

11:58.346 --> 11:59.654
Welcome to the Yap Trap!

11:59.685 --> 12:01.194
You caught me.

12:01.226 --> 12:02.860
I'll give you guys a grand tour.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.759
Linda, Bob, this is your room.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.167
Soundproof walls.

12:06.198 --> 12:07.773
So don't hold back.

12:07.805 --> 12:10.084
I can yell anything I want;
No one can hear me!

12:10.116 --> 12:11.290
I love my family!

12:11.321 --> 12:12.495
Gene.

12:12.526 --> 12:13.935
And here's the kids' room.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.099
Mirrors on the ceiling.

12:15.188 --> 12:16.730
Hey Dr. Yap, look up.

12:16.762 --> 12:18.504
Hi.
Hi.

12:18.536 --> 12:20.313
Hi.
Hi.

12:20.344 --> 12:22.062
Okay, see you back in real life.

12:22.135 --> 12:23.411
Hi.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.184
That's funny.

12:25.216 --> 12:27.361
There's only one more bedroom
but two people left.

12:27.393 --> 12:28.767
Me and Gayle.

12:28.799 --> 12:30.575
Yeah, Gayle,
this room looks comfy.

12:30.607 --> 12:32.349
Why don't we just
put your bags in here?

12:32.381 --> 12:34.220
No. I think I'd rather stay
with you and Linda.

12:34.251 --> 12:35.866
Ho-ho, Lady Gayle.

12:35.897 --> 12:37.105
Don't you worry.

12:37.137 --> 12:39.264
We'll figure it out later.

12:39.296 --> 12:41.139
And last, but not least...

12:41.171 --> 12:42.505
"Jacooze."

12:48.302 --> 12:50.141
It doesn't get hot,
but the bubbles still work.

12:50.173 --> 12:51.569
We can make it hot.

12:51.601 --> 12:53.913
Hey, who's ready to go skiing?
Let's get dressed.

12:53.945 --> 12:56.022
Yap, I thought you were
hitting it off with Gayle.

12:56.054 --> 12:57.044
What happened?

12:57.075 --> 12:58.048
She's a fighter, Bob.

12:58.079 --> 12:59.421
I like it.

12:59.452 --> 13:01.196
And I have
The Prince on my side.

13:01.227 --> 13:02.536
Hello there, my brothers.

13:02.567 --> 13:03.707
I almost didn't see you.

13:03.738 --> 13:04.746
I am...

13:04.777 --> 13:06.452
The Prince of Persuasia!

13:06.483 --> 13:08.578
There are three steps to
persuading women.

13:08.610 --> 13:09.567
Step number one:

13:09.598 --> 13:11.832
Trap your princess.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.022
Physically corner her in a room
and eventually, in your life.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.317
Insult your princess.

13:17.349 --> 13:21.002
Insult her face, her body,
her brain, her car.

13:21.082 --> 13:24.013
The lower her self-esteem, the
higher your chances, bro.

13:24.045 --> 13:26.007
It's been biologically proven.

13:26.038 --> 13:27.045
By me.

13:27.076 --> 13:28.501
Brag.

13:28.532 --> 13:30.208
Not lying, but close.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.317
Make up a story about how you

13:32.349 --> 13:34.026
single-handedly murdered
a wild animal.

13:34.057 --> 13:35.655
Your story is going
to release a hormone,

13:35.687 --> 13:37.758
deep inside her body,
called Insatia.

13:37.790 --> 13:39.484
It makes women ovulate.

13:39.515 --> 13:40.515
For sex.

13:41.742 --> 13:43.142
Interesting.

13:44.856 --> 13:45.862
Woop.

13:45.893 --> 13:46.867
Oops.

13:46.898 --> 13:48.106
Oops.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.495
Oops. Whoops.

13:49.526 --> 13:51.061
Well, Gene and Louise
don't want to ski,

13:51.092 --> 13:52.650
but you guys, you want
to take a lesson?

13:52.682 --> 13:53.781
We don't need a lesson.

13:53.812 --> 13:55.452
Are you serious?
You both know how to ski?

13:55.487 --> 13:57.397
Tina and I came up here

13:57.428 --> 13:59.456
for the Tom Selleck charity
event... Ski for Babies.

13:59.488 --> 14:01.097
For every jump he went off,

14:01.128 --> 14:02.771
they were gonna give $100
to a baby.

14:02.802 --> 14:04.411
Yeah, but he was a no-show.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.241
All these people standing around
with cameras.

14:06.273 --> 14:07.157
And babies.

14:07.188 --> 14:08.932
All right, fine.

14:08.963 --> 14:11.231
I'll skip the lesson
and figure it out as I go.

14:14.756 --> 14:15.829
Whoo-hoo!
Lin!

14:15.860 --> 14:16.918
Grab my hand!

14:16.949 --> 14:18.541
Whah-ha!
Take me with you!

14:18.573 --> 14:19.923
Sorry! Missed ya!

14:20.447 --> 14:21.421
Aah!

14:21.452 --> 14:23.313
Oh, God.

14:23.344 --> 14:25.261
Trap him.

14:26.809 --> 14:28.837
Oh, Bob.
This is our chance.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.046
Oh, Gayle.
No. We can't.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.055
Not here.
It's too visible.

14:33.087 --> 14:34.261
We should do it in the forest.

14:34.292 --> 14:35.132
Right.
Or the parking lot.

14:35.163 --> 14:36.521
Great.

14:36.552 --> 14:38.380
Insult your princess.

14:38.412 --> 14:39.971
Your face is fat.

14:40.002 --> 14:41.560
No, it's not.
It's perfect. I'm sorry.

14:41.592 --> 14:42.900
I'm sorry.
What's that?

14:42.931 --> 14:45.327
♪ La, la, la!
Livin' it up! ♪

14:45.359 --> 14:47.939
Okay, we each shovel
snow into our pants.

14:47.971 --> 14:51.019
First person to give up, get
hypothermia, or die, loses.

14:51.052 --> 14:52.052
Okay.

14:54.650 --> 14:55.624
I'm fine.

14:55.655 --> 14:56.996
I love it.

14:57.027 --> 14:58.168
Yeah, I don't feel anything.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.207
This is great.

14:59.238 --> 15:00.212
Ahh...

15:00.243 --> 15:01.543
This feels incredible!

15:04.562 --> 15:05.970
Here you go.

15:06.002 --> 15:07.486
Thank you very much.

15:10.388 --> 15:12.227
All right, I'll leave
you two love birds alone.

15:12.258 --> 15:13.758
See you at the bottom!

15:16.128 --> 15:17.823
Yeah, last time I was
out in the wilderness,

15:17.855 --> 15:20.133
I had to snap a wolf's neck
while holding an orphan.

15:20.165 --> 15:21.171
Bob!

15:21.202 --> 15:22.536
Wait for me!

15:24.417 --> 15:27.665
One time, in P.E.,
I beat a dog at basketball.

15:27.698 --> 15:30.060
Playing hard to get, I see.

15:30.092 --> 15:31.819
Playing hard to get, I see.

15:31.850 --> 15:34.259
Here we go!

15:43.184 --> 15:45.663
I love your ski
suit, Dr. Yap.

15:45.696 --> 15:46.802
What size are you?

15:46.833 --> 15:48.309
I'm a men's petite six.

15:48.341 --> 15:50.067
Ooh, big boy.

15:50.099 --> 15:51.239
You wanna swap later?

15:51.270 --> 15:52.963
Swapsies!

15:52.995 --> 15:55.307
Last one down's a Chimichanga!

15:55.339 --> 15:56.847
Hey, Bob!

15:56.878 --> 15:58.597
Let's look for a secluded
part of the woods,

15:58.628 --> 15:59.727
so we can be alone.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.200
No, thanks.
I'm good.

16:01.231 --> 16:02.406
Uh! Aah!

16:02.437 --> 16:04.113
Perfect.

16:04.145 --> 16:05.679
I'll just follow
your Insatia trail.

16:13.118 --> 16:14.945
Ah! Ah!

16:14.976 --> 16:15.883
I'm okay.

16:15.914 --> 16:17.105
Okay.

16:17.136 --> 16:18.695
Who can build a better snowman?

16:18.726 --> 16:20.570
Ho-oh!
Are you kidding me?

16:20.602 --> 16:23.114
I practically majored
in snowman building.

16:23.147 --> 16:24.103
Nuh-uh-uh.

16:24.134 --> 16:25.894
Up there...

16:25.925 --> 16:27.167
Ooh...

16:27.198 --> 16:29.793
Bob!
I'm gonna catch you!

16:29.826 --> 16:30.884
Gayle!
This isn't funny!

16:30.915 --> 16:32.004
I'm out of control!

16:32.036 --> 16:33.695
Me, too!

16:33.743 --> 16:37.192
Mine's name is Greglisa,
the androgynous snowman!

16:37.226 --> 16:38.752
He/She's from Thailand.

16:38.783 --> 16:41.295
Mine is a self-portrait
of me in the future,

16:41.328 --> 16:44.246
when I own a falcon
who holds my jawbreaker for me.

16:47.220 --> 16:48.579
No!

16:48.610 --> 16:50.637
I win!

16:50.669 --> 16:52.429
Hey, where's the jawbreaker?

16:52.460 --> 16:54.745
Ow! Ow!

16:56.110 --> 16:57.117
What the hell?

16:57.148 --> 16:58.121
Oh, my God.

16:58.152 --> 16:59.193
I broke my tooth.

16:59.224 --> 17:00.164
Finally, Bob.

17:00.195 --> 17:02.189
We're alone.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.633
Gayle, wait, I hurt myself.

17:04.665 --> 17:06.910
I'm not wearing anything
under my snowsuit.

17:06.942 --> 17:07.948
Oh, my God!

17:07.979 --> 17:09.890
Except for my long underwear.

17:09.922 --> 17:11.497
And my socks.
And my other socks.

17:11.529 --> 17:12.637
And a maxi pad.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.510
Ow! Gayle!

17:14.541 --> 17:16.586
This is serious.
I need Dr. Yap.

17:16.617 --> 17:18.602
We don't need him anymore, Bob.

17:19.397 --> 17:20.372
Ow!

17:20.403 --> 17:21.409
Hi, Bob.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.431
Dr. Yap!

17:22.462 --> 17:23.669
Thank God you're here.

17:23.700 --> 17:24.808
This one's here.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.617
But this one's down here.

17:27.651 --> 17:28.842
Gayle!

17:28.873 --> 17:30.582
Bobby!

17:30.614 --> 17:31.755
Linda. Good.

17:31.786 --> 17:32.894
This has gone too far.

17:32.925 --> 17:34.367
And I broke my tooth.

17:34.398 --> 17:36.308
Tell everybody
what's going on here.

17:36.340 --> 17:38.518
These two were
fooling around, Linda.

17:38.550 --> 17:42.668
Oh, Linda, I am so sorry you
had to witness our foreplay.

17:42.702 --> 17:43.976
I can't believe this!

17:44.008 --> 17:45.817
You're a hurtful slut, Bob!

17:45.849 --> 17:47.626
I can't take this anymore, Lin.

17:47.657 --> 17:49.334
You need to tell Gayle
what's going on.

17:49.365 --> 17:50.405
Enough's enough.

17:50.436 --> 17:51.711
Ow! My tooth!

17:51.742 --> 17:53.753
Stop! Lin, please,
drop the act!

17:53.784 --> 17:54.808
I'm in serious pain here!

17:54.839 --> 17:56.113
Good!

17:56.145 --> 17:58.006
It looks to me like
you're in need

17:58.037 --> 17:59.579
of some serious dental work.

17:59.611 --> 18:00.567
And a smack!

18:00.598 --> 18:01.598
Ow!

18:04.522 --> 18:06.573
I don't have any Novocain
with me, Bob, so...

18:07.836 --> 18:09.713
Unfortunately for you...

18:09.745 --> 18:11.143
you'll be experiencing
some pain.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.259
Uh-uh.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.049
A little pain might
do him some good.

18:14.081 --> 18:15.238
Bring him back to his senses.

18:15.269 --> 18:16.656
No! I need drugs!

18:16.726 --> 18:18.268
Let's tie his tooth
to the front door

18:18.300 --> 18:19.474
and then order a pizza

18:19.505 --> 18:20.862
and tell the guy
to let himself in.

18:20.894 --> 18:21.651
That's stupid.

18:21.681 --> 18:23.425
Let's tie it to a deer,

18:23.457 --> 18:25.295
and then tell the deer
he's late for a meeting!

18:25.327 --> 18:26.137
Gene.

18:26.168 --> 18:27.744
We're two princes, Bob.

18:27.776 --> 18:29.886
And we're going after
the same princess.

18:29.918 --> 18:32.263
But only one of us has pliers.

18:32.295 --> 18:33.571
Why'd you kiss me?

18:33.602 --> 18:34.574
Stop it!

18:34.605 --> 18:36.840
No! Noooo!

18:39.327 --> 18:41.086
Yes!
I have Dad's tooth!

18:41.118 --> 18:42.276
Who am I? Who am I?

18:42.307 --> 18:43.331
I'm Dad!

18:43.362 --> 18:44.368
Ow!

18:44.399 --> 18:45.741
My tooth hurts!

18:45.772 --> 18:46.746
Ow!

18:46.777 --> 18:47.767
I want it!

18:47.798 --> 18:49.115
Challenge me for it.

18:49.188 --> 18:51.098
Whoever drinks the most
Jacuzzi water wins!

18:51.130 --> 18:53.090
Sold.
Yeah!

18:53.122 --> 18:55.852
Dr. Yap, earlier today,
I fell for you.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.828
But after watching you
torture my father,

18:57.860 --> 18:59.435
I think we should
just be friends.

18:59.467 --> 19:01.110
With dental benefits.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.834
Okay.

19:02.865 --> 19:04.876
Hey, now that Bob's
out of the picture,

19:04.908 --> 19:07.253
maybe you and I could
hop in the "Jacooze"

19:07.285 --> 19:08.894
for a nice cold dip, hmm?

19:08.926 --> 19:11.104
Eh, let me know
when Bob wakes up.

19:11.136 --> 19:13.156
But... I-I did
all three steps!

19:14.216 --> 19:15.491
Nobody likes me!

19:15.522 --> 19:18.457
Aw, people like you.

19:22.219 --> 19:23.427
Shh, shh. Little baby.

19:23.458 --> 19:24.800
Little baby.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.941
You don't worry
about Gayle, okay?

19:26.973 --> 19:28.750
You're a good guy.
A real catch.

19:28.781 --> 19:29.755
No! No!

19:29.786 --> 19:30.726
Ow...

19:30.757 --> 19:32.165
What happened?

19:32.196 --> 19:33.873
You!
Linda wasn't enough, huh?

19:33.904 --> 19:35.714
So you had to have Gayle, too?

19:35.746 --> 19:39.730
Well, maybe if you dropped
the whole persuasion thing,

19:39.764 --> 19:42.399
Gayle might actually pay
attention to you.

19:42.476 --> 19:44.085
Well, Linda pays
attention to me.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.897
In fact, she said she wanted
to get in my snow suit.

19:46.930 --> 19:47.903
Didn't you, Linda?

19:47.934 --> 19:48.874
What?

19:48.904 --> 19:49.978
I did?

19:50.009 --> 19:51.050
You did?!

19:51.081 --> 19:52.181
Wait a minute!

19:52.253 --> 19:54.498
You're in love
with Dr. Yap?!

19:54.530 --> 19:55.939
Hmm... Yes!

19:55.970 --> 19:57.612
I am in love
with Dr. Yap.

19:57.644 --> 19:58.952
You are?

19:58.983 --> 20:00.559
Wait, what is going on here?

20:00.590 --> 20:03.153
Well, that's too bad,
because I'm in love with him.

20:03.185 --> 20:05.781
I knew it from the moment we met

20:05.813 --> 20:08.878
that this short, weird,
musky dentist

20:08.911 --> 20:11.079
was the man of my dreams.

20:11.154 --> 20:12.228
Makes sense.

20:12.259 --> 20:13.199
He's mine!

20:13.230 --> 20:14.263
No, he's mine!

20:15.306 --> 20:16.748
Who wants me more?

20:16.779 --> 20:18.171
Don't be gentle.

20:18.202 --> 20:19.126
No!

20:19.156 --> 20:20.398
Come on, Dr. Yap.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.155
Let's go.

20:22.187 --> 20:23.848
See? It all worked out.

20:23.894 --> 20:25.035
It all worked out?!

20:25.066 --> 20:26.775
You slapped me.
I lost a tooth.

20:26.807 --> 20:29.152
When I saw her
on top of my Bobby,

20:29.184 --> 20:32.082
kissing him and touching him...
oh, I went mental.

20:32.114 --> 20:34.209
Well, I'll never kiss
your sister again.

20:34.241 --> 20:35.598
Next challenge!

20:35.630 --> 20:37.841
First person to catch
a squirrel wins!

20:37.874 --> 20:39.141
I'm the Squirrel Whisperer.

20:41.305 --> 20:43.232
But you put me up to this.

20:43.264 --> 20:45.927
Yeah, well, I didn't appreciate
seeing it with my own eyes.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.522
But hey, at least
we got to go skiing, right?

20:48.555 --> 20:49.628
That was fun.

20:49.659 --> 20:50.666
Right?

20:50.697 --> 20:51.688
Got one!

20:51.719 --> 20:53.228
No fair!
It's dead!

20:53.259 --> 20:54.165
It's not dead.
It's sleeping.

20:54.196 --> 20:55.873
Gene wins the tooth.

20:55.904 --> 20:57.563
Come on!
Yeah!

20:57.595 --> 21:00.413
Let's get out of here, squirrel.

21:02.367 --> 21:03.841
Dress like her dad.

21:03.873 --> 21:06.553
It release a hormone
called moan-a-tonin.

21:06.585 --> 21:08.963
When you get into
an elevator with a woman,

21:08.996 --> 21:10.705
press a higher number than her,

21:10.737 --> 21:12.580
and then make a big
deal about it.

21:12.612 --> 21:14.322
Push her in a lake.

21:14.353 --> 21:16.665
Be one of the tallest
guys in the bar,

21:16.697 --> 21:19.109
and brag about how long
your butt-crack is.

21:19.141 --> 21:22.256
Sing a song that you
supposedly heard on the radio,

21:22.289 --> 21:24.199
and make fun of her
for not knowing it.

21:24.231 --> 21:26.208
Use the word "idiot."

21:26.240 --> 21:30.525
Never make her pancakes.

21:30.559 --> 21:32.034
Force her to make you pancakes,

21:32.064 --> 21:33.231
in the middle of the night.
