00:00.995 --> 00:02.710
Previously on The Originals...

00:02.713 --> 00:04.606
I guess I'll see you in the next life.

00:04.609 --> 00:07.320
I'll be waiting for another dance.

00:07.323 --> 00:10.242
My mother... you let her die.

00:13.637 --> 00:16.104
Hope's taking the power from us.

00:23.312 --> 00:25.804
If he dies, I won't just lose him...

00:26.846 --> 00:29.039
...I'll trigger my curse.

00:29.042 --> 00:31.142
The dark magic is destroying Hope

00:31.145 --> 00:32.377
from the inside out.

00:32.378 --> 00:33.822
So how do we stop it?

00:33.825 --> 00:35.379
There's nothing we can do.

00:35.382 --> 00:38.054
She's my daughter.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:48.061 --> 00:51.129
It's been a long time since
we've shared a drink together.

00:51.131 --> 00:53.832
You're gonna need it.

00:55.817 --> 00:58.051
I take it Davina didn't bring good news.

00:58.054 --> 01:00.834
She and Freya have been holed
up with spell books all week,

01:00.837 --> 01:03.067
searching for any last
ideas to help Hope.

01:03.070 --> 01:04.342
They're out of options.

01:04.345 --> 01:05.567
I don't accept that.

01:05.570 --> 01:07.178
Look, I love that kid.

01:07.180 --> 01:09.247
It's because I love her
that I am telling you.

01:09.249 --> 01:11.549
There is no miracle fix here.

01:11.551 --> 01:13.885
Now, she might've had
a little more time,

01:13.887 --> 01:15.825
but she's about to
experience her first full moon

01:15.828 --> 01:17.625
since she triggered her curse.

01:17.628 --> 01:19.691
Every witch that we consulted is sure

01:19.694 --> 01:21.249
that she won't survive the night.

01:21.252 --> 01:22.418
Then we speak with Freya.

01:22.421 --> 01:24.295
She will perform a binding spell.

01:24.297 --> 01:25.703
That's the solution.

01:25.706 --> 01:28.833
A spell that powerful
would only kill her faster.

01:32.695 --> 01:35.181
This is terminal, Elijah.

01:36.776 --> 01:39.711
Now we can't keep this a
secret from her any longer.

01:39.713 --> 01:44.849
She needs to have the
chance to say good-bye.

01:44.851 --> 01:48.653
And we both know who needs to tell her.

01:54.554 --> 01:56.378
He won't accept it.

01:56.381 --> 01:57.747
Make him.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.765
She is dying, Elijah.

02:02.203 --> 02:04.403
Niklaus.

02:04.406 --> 02:06.835
Get in the car. You and I are
taking Hope on a little trip.

02:06.838 --> 02:09.107
- Are you out of your mind?
- She can sleep on the drive.

02:09.109 --> 02:11.426
- Surely you heard Marcel.
- He doesn't know anything!

02:11.429 --> 02:13.044
- Where are we going?
- Hope's school knows how to deal

02:13.046 --> 02:14.212
with a werewolf's first transformation.

02:14.214 --> 02:15.280
They have a facility.

02:15.282 --> 02:16.829
Mystic Falls?

02:16.832 --> 02:18.598
I take it you have a plan.

02:18.601 --> 02:22.403
I do and while I execute it,
I need you to look after her,

02:22.406 --> 02:24.222
to-to make sure she
doesn't exert herself.

02:24.224 --> 02:25.490
Wouldn't it be better
for you to find someone

02:25.492 --> 02:27.356
Hope despises a little less than me?

02:27.359 --> 02:29.794
Perhaps quite literally
anyone else she's ever met.

02:29.796 --> 02:31.796
How Hope feels about
you is of no consequence.

02:31.798 --> 02:34.666
I have until the crest of the
full moon to save her life.

02:34.668 --> 02:36.801
We've defied the inevitable
for a dozen lifetimes.

02:36.803 --> 02:38.856
I am not about to surrender to it now.

02:38.859 --> 02:42.607
Please, Elijah.

02:42.609 --> 02:45.510
You're the only one I trust.

03:06.064 --> 03:07.331
At the Salvatore School

03:07.333 --> 03:08.484
for the Young and Gifted,

03:08.487 --> 03:10.754
we are big on spirit.

03:14.976 --> 03:18.855
Education is our first
priority, obviously.

03:18.858 --> 03:22.988
We've sent students to the
Ivy League, to Silicon Valley.

03:22.991 --> 03:24.847
Of course, if you're looking

03:24.850 --> 03:27.552
for a more unique course of study,

03:27.554 --> 03:30.922
I assure you, we are unmatched.

03:30.924 --> 03:35.051
We believe in inclusive
blending of the species here.

03:35.054 --> 03:38.093
So, outside of full moons,

03:38.096 --> 03:42.769
vampires, witches and werewolves
all cohabitate peacefully.

03:42.772 --> 03:45.036
Where do you keep the hybrids?

03:45.038 --> 03:46.571
In the root cellar?

03:46.573 --> 03:48.239
Excuse me.

03:48.241 --> 03:52.944
I just need one minute with
this very lost new janitor.

03:54.147 --> 03:55.346
Come on, Bob.

03:55.348 --> 03:57.148
I'll show you the toilets.

04:01.121 --> 04:02.854
Seriously?

04:02.856 --> 04:04.722
You're not exactly a selling point

04:04.725 --> 04:06.514
for this place.

04:06.517 --> 04:09.225
Oh, because these kids
have so many other options.

04:09.228 --> 04:11.995
I thought we made a deal about
you showing up in Mystic Falls.

04:11.998 --> 04:13.665
That was a long time ago.

04:15.288 --> 04:17.370
I need your help, Caroline.

04:17.373 --> 04:18.738
Hope is dying.

04:18.741 --> 04:20.272
She consumed the dark magic

04:20.274 --> 04:22.173
and now it's consuming her.

04:22.175 --> 04:24.709
She won't survive tonight's full moon.

04:24.711 --> 04:26.511
She triggered her curse?

04:26.513 --> 04:28.645
It was my fault.

04:28.648 --> 04:31.316
Uh, I thought that the Crescent wolves

04:31.319 --> 04:33.217
could control their transformations.

04:33.219 --> 04:34.304
Not the first one.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.320
It's a rite of passage. Unavoidable.

04:36.322 --> 04:38.590
Well, what do you need from me?

04:38.593 --> 04:43.124
I need a very rare type of witch

04:43.127 --> 04:45.962
from the Gemini Coven.

04:45.965 --> 04:48.465
You can't be serious.

04:48.468 --> 04:51.429
I need your daughters, Caroline.

04:57.236 --> 04:59.470
The diary of Stefan Salvatore.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.535
We're not supposed to touch it,

05:03.538 --> 05:06.451
but I practically have
the whole thing memorized.

05:06.453 --> 05:08.419
And spoiler alert:

05:08.421 --> 05:12.490
Dad is the villain and
you're the evil henchman.

05:12.492 --> 05:14.886
- From one very biased perspective.
- Yeah, well,

05:14.889 --> 05:16.855
I, uh, got a second opinion.

05:16.858 --> 05:20.082
The Mystic Falls Files

05:20.085 --> 05:23.634
by Alaric Saltzman, Volume One.

05:23.636 --> 05:26.904
In every story, Dad is the big bad wolf.

05:32.069 --> 05:33.311
Hope, what is it?

05:33.313 --> 05:34.312
What's happening?

05:34.314 --> 05:37.014
Nothing. I'm fine.

05:37.017 --> 05:39.529
Well, Davina said she gave you
some pills for the discomfort.

05:39.532 --> 05:42.199
Yeah, well, you know what would
really make me feel better?

05:42.202 --> 05:45.256
Is spending the day
with, like, anyone else.

05:45.258 --> 05:47.625
Let's get out of here.

05:47.627 --> 05:48.893
I know a place in town.

05:48.895 --> 05:50.449
Does a disturbingly decadent burger.

05:50.452 --> 05:52.196
- Let's do that.
- I'm not hungry.

05:52.198 --> 05:54.432
Fine. You can have a milk shake.

05:55.902 --> 05:57.235
No.

05:57.237 --> 05:59.203
No, absolutely not.

05:59.205 --> 06:01.655
They're-they're children.

06:01.658 --> 06:02.872
They're siphoner witches.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.371
It's what they were born to do.

06:04.374 --> 06:06.186
Siphon magic from one thing...

06:06.189 --> 06:08.360
And put it in another.

06:08.363 --> 06:11.965
So, after they siphon it from Hope,

06:11.968 --> 06:13.818
what are they supposed to do with it?

06:13.820 --> 06:16.587
You can't just shove a demon
in a jar and put it on a shelf.

06:16.589 --> 06:18.517
They'll put it in me.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.855
That's great.

06:21.858 --> 06:25.968
And then you can practice
mindful meditation

06:25.971 --> 06:27.467
while we just cross our fingers

06:27.470 --> 06:29.801
and hope that you don't
develop some sort of temper.

06:29.803 --> 06:31.803
Oh, wait.

06:34.574 --> 06:36.824
Do you remember when
you and your friends

06:36.827 --> 06:39.269
threatened to chain me
up, drown me in cement

06:39.272 --> 06:40.801
and drop me in the deepest ocean?

06:40.804 --> 06:44.511
Well, when your daughters
put the magic in me,

06:44.514 --> 06:47.118
I need you to make good on that threat.

06:49.689 --> 06:51.621
I won't fight you this time.

06:51.624 --> 06:53.825
No, I was just a kid back then.

06:53.827 --> 06:55.059
I didn't know...

06:55.061 --> 06:58.229
That was a long time ago.

06:58.231 --> 07:01.332
I can't allow my daughter to die.

07:01.334 --> 07:04.368
But I promise you

07:04.370 --> 07:06.370
I will not endanger yours.

07:06.372 --> 07:08.306
Caroline, please.

07:08.308 --> 07:10.107
Caroline.

07:11.978 --> 07:13.644
I'm begging you.

07:37.036 --> 07:40.679
If you're here to tell me that
my dad has a heart of gold,

07:40.682 --> 07:43.106
this is probably the worst spot,

07:43.109 --> 07:44.742
considering that there's a plaque inside

07:44.744 --> 07:46.310
near the dartboard for some woman

07:46.312 --> 07:48.136
that he killed in a moonstone ritual.

07:48.139 --> 07:50.414
Take a look at that
storefront across the street

07:50.416 --> 07:52.383
with the charcoal awning.

07:52.385 --> 07:55.720
Piece of land used to be our home.

07:55.722 --> 07:58.347
Smell of it still haunts me to this day.

07:58.350 --> 08:02.827
The burning wood, the
crushed flowers, the berries.

08:02.829 --> 08:07.269
Your father was incessantly
painting back in those days.

08:07.272 --> 08:11.511
Mixing, searching for brighter
reds, for deeper blues.

08:11.514 --> 08:13.631
Used to wake me in
the middle of the night

08:13.634 --> 08:16.175
just to show me the
color that he would swear

08:16.178 --> 08:17.742
he himself had invented.

08:17.744 --> 08:20.544
I remember the first time
that he showed me a turquoise.

08:23.676 --> 08:26.377
It's also the first
time I smelled blood.

08:28.721 --> 08:31.855
You see, when Mikael found
Niklaus fashioning a paintbrush

08:31.858 --> 08:34.759
from a small branch,
he took that branch...

08:37.900 --> 08:41.802
He struck my brother across the face.

08:44.889 --> 08:46.718
What did you do?

08:49.409 --> 08:51.943
Niklaus begged me to run
away with him, but I told him

08:51.945 --> 08:56.580
that I would never leave Rebekah
and Kol at the mercy of Mikael.

08:58.718 --> 09:00.284
So we stayed.

09:00.286 --> 09:01.670
And, of course,

09:01.673 --> 09:03.554
it was a mistake.

09:03.556 --> 09:06.237
We should've run away together, but...

09:06.240 --> 09:09.308
your father couldn't go alone.

09:09.311 --> 09:13.831
But I did swear to
him I would protect him

09:13.833 --> 09:15.132
from that very day.

09:15.134 --> 09:17.472
Peanut butter blast,
whipped cream on the bottom.

09:17.475 --> 09:19.421
Just how you like it.

09:19.424 --> 09:22.191
Thanks, Landon.

09:22.194 --> 09:25.443
Yeah.

09:25.445 --> 09:27.478
Uh, this is my uncle.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.714
Nice to meet you, Mr. Marshall.

09:29.717 --> 09:32.283
So, Hope.

09:32.285 --> 09:34.637
You haven't been around much lately.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.042
Oh, yeah, there's been
stuff back at home.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.459
Oh. Well, I was, I was
hoping you'd be back.

09:41.461 --> 09:43.058
I mean, you're from New Orleans, right?

09:43.061 --> 09:44.428
I've always wanted to go. It's home

09:44.430 --> 09:47.231
to some of the greatest
musicians of all time.

09:47.233 --> 09:49.826
You should go.

09:49.829 --> 09:52.072
No matter where you are,
there's always someone playing

09:52.075 --> 09:54.375
a Louis Armstrong song somewhere.

09:58.945 --> 10:01.078
Uh, actually, there's, um,

10:01.080 --> 10:02.813
there's music in the square tonight.

10:02.815 --> 10:04.898
I mean, they do it all the
time, but tonight there's this

10:04.900 --> 10:07.859
kind of bluesy vibe and I
thought maybe if you wanted...

10:07.862 --> 10:11.597
Oh, Landon, I-I can't tonight.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.339
I have a thing.

10:13.342 --> 10:14.420
Right, yeah.

10:14.423 --> 10:17.061
I should probably pick
up an extra shift anyway.

10:17.063 --> 10:20.798
No, thanks, though, for
asking and for the milk shake.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.301
Yeah. It was nice to meet you.

10:24.303 --> 10:25.703
And you.

10:31.311 --> 10:35.379
The full moon doesn't crest until later.

10:35.381 --> 10:37.014
You could've gone with him.

10:39.152 --> 10:40.718
Why didn't you?

10:44.023 --> 10:46.190
Because I'm gonna be dead soon.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.387
What do we get if we say yes?

10:57.389 --> 10:59.309
The warm feeling in your heart

10:59.312 --> 11:01.592
that comes from helping
a friend in need.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.361
Well, we are in need of new cell phones.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.765
And permission to go to
the senior solstice dance.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.900
And, you and Dad

11:09.902 --> 11:12.436
take the skirt-length
rules out of the dress code.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.861
It's anti-feminist and oppressive.

11:14.864 --> 11:16.240
And not cute.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.831
No to the phones.

11:19.834 --> 11:22.033
Maybe to the dance.

11:22.036 --> 11:23.881
And yes to defying the patriarchy

11:23.883 --> 11:25.682
one plaid skirt at a time.

11:27.683 --> 11:28.882
Deal?

11:31.490 --> 11:32.856
Deal.

11:34.493 --> 11:36.293
Now Mr. Mikaelson is going to explain

11:36.296 --> 11:38.362
exactly what he needs you to do.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.611
Very clearly and kindly,

11:41.614 --> 11:43.100
without even a hint

11:43.102 --> 11:45.936
of a temper or frustration.

11:48.274 --> 11:51.286
First of all, thank you.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.581
Dad?

11:57.583 --> 12:02.246
Whatever the hell's going on here, no.

12:06.317 --> 12:07.991
How did you know?

12:10.763 --> 12:13.597
Every witch in our family locked
in the bell tower all week.

12:13.599 --> 12:16.667
Creepy black veins all over my body.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.001
And...

12:18.004 --> 12:20.971
it hurts, you know?

12:22.623 --> 12:24.923
How long do I have?

12:24.926 --> 12:27.444
In your condition...

12:27.446 --> 12:30.020
we don't believe that
you'll be strong enough

12:30.023 --> 12:31.982
to handle the full moon.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.521
What's not to handle?

12:37.523 --> 12:41.058
It's only every bone in my
body breaking all at once.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.292
You listen to me,

12:42.294 --> 12:44.294
your father is searching for a cure,

12:44.296 --> 12:45.863
even as we speak. We will not

12:45.865 --> 12:47.965
allow anything to happen to you.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.534
- You understand?
- Elijah,

12:50.536 --> 12:52.736
it might be all for the best anyway.

12:52.738 --> 12:55.906
Why would you say that?

12:55.908 --> 12:59.843
Hey, nice outfit. That's really cute.

12:59.845 --> 13:03.520
All right, boys, let's roll.

13:03.523 --> 13:05.749
Whoa-ho-ho. I'm so sorry.

13:05.751 --> 13:06.917
I didn't mean to slip.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.218
That's my bad.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.720
You guys are seven bucks short.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.231
No, that's your tip, Kirby.

13:11.234 --> 13:12.399
That's negative seven bucks

13:12.402 --> 13:14.024
for the poor service that we received.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.440
Know how to drive?

13:30.442 --> 13:34.578
Um, Mom and Declan taught
me a little in the old truck.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.084
I think it's probably
time you drove a Bentley.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.719
Come with me.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.034
Alaric.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.703
You can cool off down here

13:59.705 --> 14:03.240
until I get you 1,000 miles
away from my daughters.

14:14.219 --> 14:17.896
That would be a stop sign
approaching. That's a stop sign.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.165
Okay, okay, don't have
a panic attack about it.

14:20.168 --> 14:22.826
It's not like I can kill you,
and I'm dying already, so...

14:22.828 --> 14:24.361
Is it absolutely necessary to destroy

14:24.363 --> 14:26.228
this work of art in the process?

14:26.231 --> 14:28.231
Hmm.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.934
I know what you're doing, you know,

14:30.936 --> 14:34.204
with the milk shakes
and driving lessons.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.493
Life's little pleasures, whatever.

14:36.496 --> 14:39.443
I'm not, like...

14:39.445 --> 14:41.311
suicidal, if that's what
you're worried about.

14:41.313 --> 14:42.913
You know, that's not what I meant

14:42.915 --> 14:45.637
when I said that dying
might be for the best.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.174
Well, you certainly don't seem to
have any interest in your survival.

14:48.176 --> 14:49.619
It's not like I want to die.

14:49.621 --> 14:51.788
I just...

14:51.790 --> 14:54.791
don't think I was meant to
exist in the first place.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.427
I think about all the crazy things

14:57.429 --> 14:59.429
that led to me being born.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.231
Dad lives 1,000 years,

15:01.233 --> 15:06.036
does weird ritual to become the
only vampire who can procreate.

15:06.038 --> 15:09.572
Mom moves from foster
home to foster home...

15:09.575 --> 15:11.608
to end up in Mystic Falls.

15:11.610 --> 15:14.644
- When Dad got sad and drunk...
- Okay.

15:14.646 --> 15:16.046
...had a one-nighter with Mom,

15:16.048 --> 15:17.948
- who was basically hate-banging him.
- We don't have to...

15:17.950 --> 15:19.649
- Honestly...
- Then, boom. Loophole.

15:19.651 --> 15:21.752
- Yeah.
- Miracle baby.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.947
But can you be a miracle and
a mistake at the same time?

15:26.950 --> 15:29.726
No one is a mistake, Hope.

15:29.728 --> 15:32.829
This family has fought tooth and nail

15:32.831 --> 15:34.231
to keep you alive from the moment

15:34.233 --> 15:35.399
we learned of your existence.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.778
I know.

15:36.781 --> 15:38.708
But the universe has
been trying to kill me

15:38.711 --> 15:40.337
since before I was born.

15:40.339 --> 15:43.073
To reset the balance of nature.

15:43.075 --> 15:44.307
And I'm grateful that

15:44.309 --> 15:46.510
you guys have fought so hard.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.149
But I knew when I took the
power back that I might die.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.384
It was my decision.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.864
Turn right here.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.523
Okay, so we're gonna spend

16:23.526 --> 16:25.993
my final hours watching
Connor get to first base

16:25.996 --> 16:28.317
with runner-up Miss Mystic Falls?

16:28.320 --> 16:32.689
Why do you suppose that your
friend Landon didn't fight back?

16:32.692 --> 16:36.916
Um, I don't know, he's...
he has to keep his job.

16:36.919 --> 16:38.251
He has to keep his job.

16:38.254 --> 16:40.163
We, however, have nothing to lose.

16:42.201 --> 16:43.762
You do understand,

16:43.765 --> 16:46.937
I could compel these idiots to
do just about anything you want.

16:52.260 --> 16:56.763
Or you can compel them to
forget what I'm about to do.

17:01.286 --> 17:03.181
That's not what I'm suggesting.

17:03.184 --> 17:05.650
You cannot be reckless with your energy.

17:05.653 --> 17:07.173
If I die in jock revenge mode,

17:07.175 --> 17:08.690
- it'll be worth it.
- Hope, you have to conserve your strength.

17:08.692 --> 17:10.493
Relax, I'll be fine.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.137
Glace, solidatur.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.939
Glace, solidatur.

17:23.012 --> 17:25.175
Glace, solidatur.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.586
Oh!

17:36.588 --> 17:38.989
My... my car!

17:38.991 --> 17:40.991
Oh, my God!

17:40.993 --> 17:44.161
What did you, what
did you do to my car?!

17:44.163 --> 17:47.030
Every single... What
did you do to my car?!

17:49.001 --> 17:50.634
Yeah, that felt good.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.168
Yeah.

17:59.011 --> 18:02.078
I'm confiscating this. Forever.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.314
Fine. It's only for the
security of the school,

18:04.316 --> 18:06.087
but apparently that's
a thing of the past,

18:06.090 --> 18:08.345
since you're just inviting
Voldemort to campus.

18:08.348 --> 18:11.588
Ric, we started this school
to protect these kids.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.290
Hope is one of them,
and she's in trouble.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.759
We can't just turn our back on her.

18:17.729 --> 18:19.863
He still clouds your judgment.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.134
What are you talking about?

18:24.136 --> 18:26.447
I am talking about Klaus Mikaelson.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.005
A cockroach of a
creature who wrought havoc

18:29.007 --> 18:30.807
on this Earth for 1,000 years

18:30.809 --> 18:33.276
and can never be stamped out, ever.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.046
And you just want to
give him more evil power?

18:42.387 --> 18:44.721
Caroline, I...

18:46.391 --> 18:49.726
I know your intentions are good.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.496
And I want to help Hope,

18:52.499 --> 18:54.264
of course I do.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.134
But we can't call another witch?

18:56.137 --> 18:58.635
Use one of the teachers?

18:58.637 --> 19:00.704
Bonnie?

19:00.706 --> 19:03.607
This is not something
that Bonnie can do.

19:03.609 --> 19:06.443
Our girls can.

19:06.445 --> 19:09.079
And then you can pop
a bottle of champagne

19:09.081 --> 19:11.676
and watch him sink to the bottom
of the Atlantic. Everyone wins.

19:11.679 --> 19:13.301
Yeah, and how many times have we tried

19:13.304 --> 19:15.332
to sink him to the bottom of the ocean?

19:17.155 --> 19:20.423
He's a willing participant this time.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.727
All right, fine, let's just pretend,

19:23.729 --> 19:25.428
for one insane moment,

19:25.431 --> 19:28.298
that you have reason enough to
believe that that's true now.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.667
You think that's gonna stick?

19:30.669 --> 19:34.471
The ocean isn't big enough
to hold him down, Care.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.440
Oh, no.

19:40.274 --> 19:42.741
Very impressive system.

19:42.744 --> 19:44.337
Secure, I'm sure,

19:44.340 --> 19:47.417
if you're a baby werewolf
navigating puberty.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.622
But I'm a little past that.

19:52.624 --> 19:53.757
Klaus...

19:53.759 --> 19:56.926
Alaric's right. The ocean won't hold me.

19:56.928 --> 19:58.628
But when I've transferred

19:58.630 --> 20:03.466
the Hollow's magic out of Hope,
I don't intend to drown it.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.462
What is that?

20:05.465 --> 20:09.873
This is the last
remaining White Oak stake.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.048
When the power is in me,

20:14.051 --> 20:17.161
there's only one way to
make sure it's gone for good.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.018
Someone needs to kill me.

20:35.224 --> 20:36.657
They fit fine.

20:36.660 --> 20:37.982
A bit dusty, but...

20:37.985 --> 20:40.871
Well, the previous owner
died a decade ago, so...

20:40.873 --> 20:44.125
He chose not to warn me before
sacrificing his life, either.

20:44.128 --> 20:45.127
- Caroline...
- Don't.

20:45.130 --> 20:46.811
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.879
Did you think that I wouldn't
let you go through with it?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.481
Well, perhaps I didn't
want to know either way.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.150
Where do you even get a White Oak stake?

20:53.152 --> 20:56.320
It was decades ago.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.935
I was gonna destroy it,

20:57.938 --> 21:00.257
but the weight of
immortality was heavier then.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.561
Maybe we can buy you some time.

21:03.563 --> 21:07.698
The magic in Hope is rooted too deeply.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.982
Tonight, when she's
trapped in that space

21:11.985 --> 21:13.820
between human and beast,
that's when your daughters

21:13.822 --> 21:15.105
can remove it from her.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.419
Are you sure that there's no other way?

21:19.422 --> 21:20.955
There's always another way.

21:22.348 --> 21:24.716
Somewhere, written in
some forgotten language,

21:24.719 --> 21:27.617
in some city lost in lava,
likely lies buried the secret

21:27.620 --> 21:30.654
to having everything I want all at once.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.193
But I'm not gonna find it today,

21:36.195 --> 21:38.829
and today is all I have.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.273
I'm going to convince Ric

21:49.275 --> 21:51.979
to let our girls help you out with this.

21:51.982 --> 21:54.783
Because you are being a good father.

21:54.786 --> 21:57.581
And you are being a good
person, and how could I

21:57.583 --> 22:01.485
tell you not to do that when
that is all that I have ever...

22:11.764 --> 22:15.165
Oh, this would be so
much easier if you just...

22:15.167 --> 22:17.902
stayed the big bad wolf.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.755
Just wait here.

22:37.599 --> 22:39.086
You know your father would kill me

22:39.089 --> 22:40.357
if he knew I let you do that.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.859
I won't tell.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.360
Please don't.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.730
Let's go back to the school.

22:46.732 --> 22:48.766
Okay? I need to lay down.

22:50.269 --> 22:51.769
Hey.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.538
Don't you give up on this fight.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.940
It's too late, Elijah.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.908
Okay?

22:57.910 --> 22:59.476
I can feel it.

22:59.478 --> 23:02.318
You should just tell my dad to
stop looking for a Hail Mary.

23:02.321 --> 23:04.080
He's gone through enough torment.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.550
You are the reason that his life
of torment has not been in vain.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.918
Now, if you're not
gonna fight for yourself,

23:07.920 --> 23:10.454
- you go fight for him.
- I don't want to fight anymore.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.690
I can't save my dad.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.588
Okay? I-I'm not a savior.

23:14.591 --> 23:16.279
If anything, I-I'm a murderer.

23:16.282 --> 23:17.447
Listen to me.

23:17.450 --> 23:19.229
The man in the church
was not your fault.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.711
- I'm talking about my mom.
- Your mother was not your fault.

23:21.714 --> 23:23.580
If anything, it was
mine. Now you blame me.

23:23.583 --> 23:25.035
Guess what? I've tried.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.638
No matter how I look at
it, it's my responsibility.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.979
Roman and his mom were afraid of me.

23:29.982 --> 23:32.076
I was the one who kidnapped
her in the first place.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.474
I left her to be taken.

23:33.477 --> 23:34.986
This family needs you.

23:34.989 --> 23:37.448
We need you, and you
are going to survive.

23:37.450 --> 23:40.918
Why? Why? I've spent my entire life

23:40.920 --> 23:42.753
trying to get our family back together,

23:42.755 --> 23:45.823
and if anything, I ruined
it, okay? I-I broke it.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.661
So please, just let me
go, because I'm tired.

23:48.664 --> 23:51.095
I'm so tired. And if anything,

23:51.097 --> 23:54.498
I just want my mom, I just want my mom.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.468
Oh, God.

23:57.470 --> 24:00.170
Hope? What's wrong?

24:04.403 --> 24:06.028
Niklaus!

24:08.411 --> 24:09.613
She just collapsed.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.278
- I don't know...
- Quiet.

24:12.818 --> 24:13.984
No heartbeat.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.552
Please. Please.

24:15.554 --> 24:16.954
Hope!

24:31.570 --> 24:33.497
Hope?

24:37.510 --> 24:38.976
Mom.

24:52.255 --> 24:54.794
What happened? Why are you here?

24:54.797 --> 24:56.994
I... I was sick.

24:56.997 --> 24:59.600
Mom, there's so much
that I have to tell you.

24:59.602 --> 25:01.101
You shouldn't be here.

25:01.103 --> 25:02.697
- It's not your time yet.
- It's okay.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.838
I want to be here. I
want to be here with you.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.074
No. You have to go back.

25:07.076 --> 25:08.909
I need you to fight this.

25:08.911 --> 25:10.010
Hope, wake up.

25:10.012 --> 25:11.412
Get Caroline.

25:11.414 --> 25:13.080
Tell her to bring her girls.

25:13.082 --> 25:14.314
Go!

25:15.451 --> 25:17.684
Please come back to me.

25:17.686 --> 25:19.013
Hope!

25:20.075 --> 25:21.564
Hope!

25:22.925 --> 25:25.783
You... you have to go back to your dad.

25:25.786 --> 25:28.128
Mom... I'm so sorry.

25:28.130 --> 25:29.763
I'm so sorry

25:29.766 --> 25:32.466
for everything that happened,
and I can't forgive myself.

25:32.468 --> 25:35.903
Well, too bad... because I forgive you.

25:37.505 --> 25:40.307
I forgive you, Hope.

25:40.309 --> 25:42.476
And I know that you're scared,

25:42.478 --> 25:44.978
and I know that you're
sad, and that's okay.

25:44.980 --> 25:48.142
What happened this year was about hatred

25:48.145 --> 25:50.361
and ugliness that was
born long before you

25:50.364 --> 25:51.952
and long before me.

25:51.954 --> 25:55.189
I need you to fight this.

25:55.191 --> 25:57.791
Hope, wake up.

25:57.793 --> 25:59.660
But I want to be here.

25:59.662 --> 26:02.229
I don't want to leave you here alone.

26:02.231 --> 26:05.099
Hope, I'm not alone.

26:05.101 --> 26:06.767
Listen.

26:11.707 --> 26:13.540
Come with me.

26:23.219 --> 26:24.751
Look.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.375
Jackson is here.

26:41.103 --> 26:43.270
My parents.

26:43.272 --> 26:45.205
Grandma Mary.

26:50.412 --> 26:52.971
I'm not dead because of you.

26:52.974 --> 26:55.983
I'm at peace because of you.

26:59.955 --> 27:03.457
If I go back, am I ever
gonna see you again?

27:06.795 --> 27:10.200
Not for a very, very long time.

27:13.636 --> 27:16.231
So you better have good stories, okay?

27:16.234 --> 27:18.228
Make art.

27:18.231 --> 27:20.140
Use your voice.

27:20.142 --> 27:22.042
Have adventures.

27:22.044 --> 27:26.013
And have at least one totally epic love.

27:31.153 --> 27:33.849
And be every bit of yourself.

27:36.106 --> 27:37.986
Because the very best

27:37.989 --> 27:39.731
of me is in you.

27:42.489 --> 27:44.198
I love you, Mom.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.266
I love you, too.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.856
Always and forever.

27:52.724 --> 27:55.006
I don't want to let go.

28:04.364 --> 28:06.388
I need you to do something for me.

28:08.185 --> 28:09.856
Please, Hope. Please.

28:09.858 --> 28:12.025
Hope, come back to me.

28:12.027 --> 28:14.528
Hope, please.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.864
Hope...

28:17.866 --> 28:19.066
Dad.

28:19.068 --> 28:20.701
Oh, you're okay.

28:20.763 --> 28:22.236
Oh, you're okay.

28:22.238 --> 28:24.263
Dad.

28:27.676 --> 28:30.611
- Dad, I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
- I know.

28:30.614 --> 28:33.361
- Don't let me.
- I know. You're not gonna die.

28:33.364 --> 28:34.869
Sweetheart, you're not gonna die.

28:34.872 --> 28:37.184
I found a way to save your life.

28:37.186 --> 28:41.688
And everything is gonna
be better in the morning.

28:41.690 --> 28:43.490
I promise you.

28:44.849 --> 28:46.326
I promise.

29:05.364 --> 29:09.032
Look, I know it's not an ideal evening,

29:09.035 --> 29:12.203
but the timing is right.

29:12.205 --> 29:14.205
Once you're mid-transformation,

29:14.207 --> 29:17.408
the Saltzman girls will be able
to siphon the magic out of you.

29:17.410 --> 29:19.477
Are you sure about this?

29:21.280 --> 29:23.247
Yeah.

29:25.220 --> 29:27.354
I'll dispose of the magic later.

29:27.357 --> 29:29.654
Tonight...

29:29.656 --> 29:31.545
is about you.

29:39.388 --> 29:41.565
I'll be right back.

30:00.255 --> 30:02.253
You looked kind of lonely.

30:06.990 --> 30:09.026
You know something?

30:11.664 --> 30:15.714
When you were born, I
declared that you would be...

30:15.717 --> 30:18.612
the savior of this family.

30:18.615 --> 30:20.677
That wasn't fair.

30:20.680 --> 30:23.240
We should never have
been your burden to bear.

30:25.909 --> 30:27.542
How old were you

30:27.545 --> 30:30.915
when you promised to
always protect my father?

30:30.917 --> 30:33.250
Much older than me?

30:34.420 --> 30:35.953
No.

30:38.917 --> 30:42.518
Elijah, I think that we were both born

30:42.521 --> 30:45.629
with responsibilities
that we didn't deserve.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.706
What?

30:52.709 --> 30:54.776
It's nothing. It's just...

30:54.779 --> 30:56.942
I see so much of your mother in you.

31:03.483 --> 31:05.182
I saw her.

31:05.184 --> 31:07.651
- What do you mean you saw her?
- When I fainted.

31:07.653 --> 31:08.748
It was probably

31:08.751 --> 31:11.785
just some white-light
hallucination, but...

31:14.267 --> 31:16.167
She told me to tell you

31:16.170 --> 31:19.096
that she's still holding
out for that dance.

31:23.236 --> 31:25.836
Probably could have been just some...

31:25.838 --> 31:30.141
weird part of my subconscious, but...

31:30.143 --> 31:34.135
either way, it was nice
to have a good dream.

31:34.138 --> 31:36.680
I haven't had one in a while.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.521
Yeah.

31:52.765 --> 31:54.165
Oh.

31:57.870 --> 31:59.635
Looks like your friend didn't need

31:59.638 --> 32:01.545
to take that extra shift after all.

32:05.011 --> 32:07.044
Behave.

32:26.532 --> 32:28.191
I thought you had to be somewhere.

32:28.194 --> 32:30.229
Uh, yeah, actually, it turns out

32:30.232 --> 32:32.770
I'm gonna be here for a little bit.

32:35.295 --> 32:37.508
Though I do have a curfew pretty soon.

32:37.510 --> 32:40.023
Ah. The private school
behind the iron gates

32:40.026 --> 32:41.893
doesn't want their fancy
students hanging out

32:41.896 --> 32:43.479
with townie riffraff too late?

32:43.482 --> 32:44.838
Shocking.

32:44.841 --> 32:48.229
No. There's plenty of
riffraff behind those gates.

32:48.232 --> 32:49.755
Trust me.

32:51.924 --> 32:54.887
So, you know that, uh, that
jerk from the Grill earlier?

32:54.890 --> 32:57.557
Apparently, he totally
wrecked his car today.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.292
And now you're here,
and the music's good,

33:00.295 --> 33:01.740
so before my luck runs out,

33:01.743 --> 33:04.385
which it will...

33:04.388 --> 33:07.004
do you maybe want to dance or something?

33:07.007 --> 33:08.440
You want me to dance with you?

33:08.443 --> 33:10.107
Fair warning, I might suck at it.

33:10.109 --> 33:12.784
I haven't really thought
this whole thing through.

33:12.787 --> 33:15.237
Kind of living in the moment here.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.945
No, it's...

33:16.948 --> 33:19.749
you know, I should probably
do more of that myself.

33:20.653 --> 33:22.620
Okay.

33:35.208 --> 33:36.440
Don't worry.

33:36.443 --> 33:39.336
I'll behave myself.

33:41.641 --> 33:43.440
Thank you,

33:43.442 --> 33:47.011
for allowing your daughters
to be involved in this mess.

33:48.014 --> 33:50.080
For trusting me.

33:52.251 --> 33:55.552
Years ago, when the
girls were really little,

33:55.554 --> 33:58.322
I was in trouble.

33:58.324 --> 34:01.706
I was scared, I just, I
put the girls in the car,

34:01.709 --> 34:02.860
and I drove.

34:02.862 --> 34:06.646
And I ended up in New Orleans...

34:06.649 --> 34:10.167
looking for you.

34:10.168 --> 34:14.170
You weren't there, but...

34:14.172 --> 34:16.106
but the point is,

34:16.108 --> 34:20.311
I think a part of me
has always known that...

34:22.295 --> 34:25.449
...you weren't the villain of my story.

34:40.399 --> 34:41.931
I...

34:41.934 --> 34:46.270
I think we need to
get back to the school.

34:46.272 --> 34:48.706
It's time.

34:48.708 --> 34:51.208
We'll be right behind you.

34:53.512 --> 34:57.481
She can have the next
five minutes dancing.

34:57.483 --> 34:59.817
I don't get it.

34:59.819 --> 35:02.604
Aren't there a million things
that you want to say to her?

35:02.607 --> 35:04.989
About life,

35:04.991 --> 35:06.724
boys, or...

35:06.726 --> 35:08.252
how to file taxes?

35:08.255 --> 35:11.028
I don't know.

35:11.030 --> 35:13.359
She'll figure it out.

35:13.362 --> 35:18.065
What I want to do is
I want to stand here,

35:18.068 --> 35:22.240
and watch my daughter
dance with a townie.

36:09.496 --> 36:11.329
It's only pain.

36:11.332 --> 36:12.830
It's completely manageable.

36:12.832 --> 36:14.465
If you get scared,

36:14.467 --> 36:16.634
all you have to do is
close your eyes, and...

36:16.636 --> 36:17.869
Sing.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.604
Yeah, I know.

36:19.606 --> 36:21.706
I'll be okay.

36:21.708 --> 36:23.708
I'll see you after.

36:25.396 --> 36:27.563
Yeah.

36:27.566 --> 36:30.234
See you after.

36:33.072 --> 36:37.548
The, uh, the Saltzman girls
have made a siphon tonic,

36:37.551 --> 36:40.953
so I'll just go and get that.

36:50.361 --> 36:51.836
I thought you were gone.

36:51.838 --> 36:54.806
And miss a chance to say good-bye?

36:58.211 --> 37:00.564
Caroline told you.

37:00.567 --> 37:02.680
I won't allow this, Niklaus.

37:02.682 --> 37:04.384
You know that.

37:04.387 --> 37:06.337
And you know this is the only option.

37:11.018 --> 37:13.084
You tell those girls to take me instead.

37:13.087 --> 37:15.121
- No.
- And you will take my life.

37:15.124 --> 37:16.234
I have burdened you enough.

37:16.237 --> 37:17.647
Your daughter needs you, Niklaus.

37:17.650 --> 37:19.383
I'm not gonna kill you!

37:40.286 --> 37:42.634
Take care of her for me, brother.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.798
Come on.

37:54.801 --> 37:56.525
What are you...?

37:56.528 --> 37:58.095
We don't have time.

37:59.837 --> 38:01.626
Dad, what's going on?

38:01.629 --> 38:03.298
We shouldn't do this inside.

38:03.301 --> 38:05.468
Your mother would've
wanted you to be out here,

38:05.471 --> 38:07.415
in nature, under the moonlight.

38:07.935 --> 38:09.301
Here.

38:09.304 --> 38:10.970
Drink this.

38:15.345 --> 38:17.037
Ow, ow. Ah.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.915
It's starting.

38:20.393 --> 38:23.259
Magia tollox de terras.

38:26.165 --> 38:28.954
Magia tollox de terras.

38:32.738 --> 38:35.142
Magia tollox de terras.

38:35.145 --> 38:36.444
Hope.

38:36.447 --> 38:37.513
Listen to me.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.978
This is going to hurt.

38:38.981 --> 38:41.514
So you need to concentrate
on the air in your lungs,

38:41.517 --> 38:43.400
and the ground beneath you.

38:43.403 --> 38:44.767
Aah! Dad!

38:44.770 --> 38:46.751
The first time, it can take hours.

38:46.754 --> 38:49.040
- Hours?
- If you fight it.

38:49.043 --> 38:50.710
The pain will make you want to delay it

38:50.713 --> 38:52.379
because you think
that's all you can take.

38:52.382 --> 38:54.212
But if you let it in,

38:54.215 --> 38:56.549
if you allow it to swallow you whole,

38:56.552 --> 38:58.419
then it cannot break you.

38:58.422 --> 39:01.323
Yeah. I can do this.

39:01.326 --> 39:04.560
When you're done, run wild and free.

39:04.563 --> 39:08.158
I am so proud of you.

40:40.594 --> 40:42.327
Where's Caroline?

40:42.330 --> 40:45.602
Well, she's a vampire,

40:45.605 --> 40:48.272
and there's a baby
werewolf roaming the woods.

40:48.274 --> 40:52.610
She just...

40:52.612 --> 40:54.537
Magia tollox de terras.

40:54.540 --> 40:56.868
...she just couldn't watch you die.

41:24.444 --> 41:27.411

41:27.413 --> 41:28.581
All right, come on, girls.

41:28.584 --> 41:29.950
Come on, let's go.

41:31.784 --> 41:33.423
Niklaus.

41:40.433 --> 41:42.267
Niklaus.

41:46.766 --> 41:48.361
Don't.
