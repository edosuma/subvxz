00:15.763 --> 00:19.109
I want you to get something to eat
before the plane comes, okay?

00:19.674 --> 00:21.865
Hannah! Zach!

00:23.040 --> 00:25.203
Almost done, Mom.

00:26.811 --> 00:29.354
No, you're not, Zach.
You just started.

00:29.542 --> 00:31.360
I'm a fast packer.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.793
That's because you're a slob.

00:35.695 --> 00:38.395
Maybe, but I'm a fast slob.

00:39.496 --> 00:40.933
Mom, done.

00:41.033 --> 00:43.033
Chinook, you're it.

00:45.268 --> 00:47.268
You're it, boy.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.600
Chinook, what are you doing?
Zach, get out of my room.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.809
We're playing tag.

00:51.909 --> 00:55.495
Zach, get him out of my room.
He's messing up everything.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.360
What in heaven's name
is going on in here?

01:00.460 --> 01:02.185
Me and Chinook are playing tag.

01:02.285 --> 01:06.445
Zach and Chinook came in my room
and messed up my whole suitcase.

01:07.236 --> 01:08.768
Okay.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.882
It's a good thing he's going with you.

01:10.982 --> 01:13.101
Come on, Chinook. Come on.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.100
Chinook, come on. Let's go.

01:28.452 --> 01:31.464
Robert, are you there?
Come in, boss.

01:32.409 --> 01:34.179
That was a good one, huh, Sheila?

01:34.279 --> 01:37.080
Yeah, it blowed up real good,
shook my whole office.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.514
There's a call for you on line one.

01:40.649 --> 01:43.286
Take a message.
I'm watching explosions.

01:43.386 --> 01:44.686
It's Mr. Ackerman.

01:44.786 --> 01:47.889
I just talked to him an hour ago.
What does he want?

01:47.989 --> 01:51.790
I don't know, but he's waiting.

01:52.225 --> 01:53.957
Okay.

02:19.478 --> 02:22.115
He probably figured out a way
he could save a couple bucks.

02:22.215 --> 02:25.117
Well, I am not laying
anybody else off.

02:25.217 --> 02:27.753
Why is it the rich guys
are always so cheap?

02:27.853 --> 02:30.286
How do you think they
got rich in the first place?

02:33.489 --> 02:35.025
Hey, Karl. How you doing?

02:35.125 --> 02:36.961
For heaven's sakes, I just
talked to you an hour ago.

02:37.061 --> 02:38.695
- Oh, yeah, right.
- Listen, Robert,

02:38.795 --> 02:41.197
I told you about my daughter's
wedding this Saturday, right?

02:41.297 --> 02:42.431
I think you mentioned it.

02:42.531 --> 02:44.266
It's going to set you
back a bundle, huh?

02:44.366 --> 02:47.201
Not anymore. It's been called off.

02:47.301 --> 02:50.604
Oh. Oh, well, I'm sorry, Karl.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.273
I'm not. It had disaster
written all over it,

02:53.373 --> 02:54.974
it was going to cost
me a small fortune,

02:55.074 --> 02:56.742
and I still have to
pay all the deposits.

02:56.842 --> 02:58.210
Well, what happened?

02:58.310 --> 03:01.379
My daughter says she's
had a change of heart,

03:01.479 --> 03:03.381
but I think her fiancÃ©
finally came to his senses.

03:03.481 --> 03:05.549
Well, I guess the
important thing is...

03:05.649 --> 03:09.552
The important thing is my
weekend has opened up.

03:09.652 --> 03:11.554
I'm coming up to the site
for a couple of days.

03:11.654 --> 03:13.455
We can go over those
cutbacks we discussed.

03:13.555 --> 03:15.257
Well, that sounds like
a great idea, Karl.

03:15.357 --> 03:16.525
Your kids.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.492
But, you know, my kids are coming up

03:18.592 --> 03:20.761
- this afternoon at...?
- 2:00.

03:20.861 --> 03:23.463
...2:00, and they're staying
through till Tuesday, so...

03:23.563 --> 03:26.398
Yes, that doesn't work, Robert.
What about your wife?

03:26.498 --> 03:28.767
I hope she's coming along.

03:28.867 --> 03:31.235
No, Karl, no. My wife's
not making this trip.

03:31.335 --> 03:35.205
Well, I guess we
all have our priorities.

03:35.305 --> 03:37.007
I'll see you in a couple of days.

03:37.107 --> 03:39.576
What a jerk.

03:39.676 --> 03:41.277
I don't think I know a bigger jerk.

03:41.377 --> 03:43.843
- Do you know a bigger jerk?
- You're still on speaker.

03:46.446 --> 03:48.146
Kidding.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.168
All right, guys,
we're really running late now,

03:53.268 --> 03:54.870
so we got to hurry up, okay?

03:54.970 --> 03:57.238
Well, you always say I eat too fast.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.244
I'm just trying to improve
my table manners.

03:59.344 --> 04:00.671
He's messing with you, Mom.

04:00.771 --> 04:03.150
Thank you, Hannah.
I'm aware of that.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.003
And he's feeding the
dog under the table.

04:05.103 --> 04:07.248
Stop feeding the dog at the table.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.514
Mom, why can't you
come visit Dad with us?

04:10.614 --> 04:14.001
Sweetie, I told you I've got too
much to do at work right now.

04:14.101 --> 04:15.414
She doesn't want to see Dad.

04:15.514 --> 04:16.714
Why not?

04:16.815 --> 04:20.166
Because they're going
through a divorce. Duh.

04:21.867 --> 04:24.804
You aren't getting a
divorce from Dad, are you?

04:25.342 --> 04:26.709
Sweetie, we're just...

04:26.809 --> 04:28.744
taking a little holiday
from each other. That's all.

04:28.844 --> 04:32.136
That's called separation, and
you know what comes after that.

04:32.236 --> 04:34.241
- Shut up, Zach!
- Hannah, stop.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.703
Zach, not another word.

04:36.803 --> 04:40.346
You know what? I'm the only one
that ever tells the truth around here.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.370
I'm calling Dad.

04:53.609 --> 04:54.603
Yeah?

04:54.703 --> 04:56.905
Robert, I have your son on line two.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.471
Can you tell him I'm
busy right now, please?

05:00.571 --> 05:03.467
Maybe you should
tell him that yourself.

05:04.642 --> 05:06.036
I guess you're right.

05:06.136 --> 05:08.437
Of course I'm right.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.542
Hey, pal.

05:12.642 --> 05:13.913
Dad?

05:14.013 --> 05:15.546
You all packed up and ready to go?

05:15.646 --> 05:17.346
Yeah, almost ready to go.

05:17.446 --> 05:19.673
I'm looking forward to
seeing you and your sister.

05:19.773 --> 05:21.208
Don't forget Chinook.

05:21.308 --> 05:23.811
How could I forget that crazy dog?

05:23.911 --> 05:25.707
He is crazy.

05:25.807 --> 05:28.170
Anyway, look, buddy,
I got to get back to work, so...

05:28.270 --> 05:31.243
Wait. I want to tell you about
my baseball game yesterday.

05:31.343 --> 05:33.901
We were down three runs,
and all the bases were loaded.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.173
It was the ninth inning.
I went up to bat, and then I...

05:36.273 --> 05:39.481
Hey, Zach, look,
why don't you tell me

05:39.581 --> 05:41.569
all this stuff when you
arrive in person, okay?

05:41.669 --> 05:44.745
I'll see you in a couple hours.
Okay? Bye-bye, son.

05:46.945 --> 05:48.939
I hit a home run.

05:53.133 --> 05:55.981
- Dad's busy, huh?
- He's always busy.

05:56.081 --> 05:57.406
Well, then, it'll be up to you guys

05:57.506 --> 05:59.806
to take his mind off
work for a little while.

06:04.234 --> 06:06.506
I think the plane's here.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.943
Okay, come on, you two! Let's go.

06:13.910 --> 06:15.235
- Don't forget Chinook.
- Let's go.

06:15.335 --> 06:17.677
Oh, don't worry. He's going.

06:37.471 --> 06:39.176
Careful.

06:45.942 --> 06:48.778
- Hi, Charlie.
- Mrs. Wade, so nice to see you.

06:48.878 --> 06:51.006
Oh! Thank you.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.136
This is my daughter
Hannah and my son Zach.

06:53.236 --> 06:55.808
- Hi, Charlie.
- It is a pleasure to meet you two.

06:55.908 --> 06:57.236
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hello.

06:57.336 --> 06:59.200
And who is this beauty?

06:59.300 --> 07:01.304
- That's Chinook.
- Oh!

07:01.404 --> 07:03.839
Sorry. He gets a little
rambunctious sometimes.

07:03.939 --> 07:05.236
He's crazy.

07:05.736 --> 07:08.973
There you go.

07:09.073 --> 07:11.547
Wow. How did you do that?

07:11.647 --> 07:13.732
Oh, I know a little bit about dogs,

07:13.832 --> 07:16.169
especially these ones.
It's a working breed, you know.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.505
If they don't have a job to help
them burn off the excess energy,

07:19.605 --> 07:22.432
they can be a little bit,
well, rambunctious.

07:23.206 --> 07:25.873
All right, let's get your
luggage aboard, shall we?

07:25.973 --> 07:28.240
- Come on, boy.
- That one's mine.

07:28.340 --> 07:30.571
- I figured as much.
- Come on, Chinook.

07:31.373 --> 07:32.907
All right, you guys.

07:33.007 --> 07:34.776
Do whatever Charlie says,
okay, and be good.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.879
Okay, Mom. Got to go.

07:36.979 --> 07:38.538
- All right, honey. All right.
- Love you, Mom.

07:38.638 --> 07:40.879
I love you too.
Oh, I love you, sweetie.

07:40.979 --> 07:43.264
I'm wearing the
medallion you gave me.

07:43.803 --> 07:45.701
Oh, good, sweetie.

07:46.170 --> 07:48.978
Good. Have fun, okay?

07:49.078 --> 07:50.905
Oh!

07:54.144 --> 07:55.912
This is their first
time on a small plane,

07:56.012 --> 07:57.712
so they might be a little bit scared.

07:57.812 --> 07:59.776
- I'm not scared.
- Yeah, me neither.

07:59.876 --> 08:02.709
Well, don't worry, Mrs. Wade.

08:02.809 --> 08:04.635
I'll make sure I take
good care of them.

08:04.735 --> 08:09.205
Thanks. Have fun, guys.

08:25.775 --> 08:27.505
Thanks.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.999
Aw, Chinook, why are
you making noise?

08:49.099 --> 08:51.242
It's okay.

08:51.342 --> 08:54.139
It's all right, boy. It's all right.

10:10.536 --> 10:12.111
So what do you guys think?
You like it up here?

10:12.211 --> 10:13.398
Yeah.

10:13.498 --> 10:15.710
Yeah.

10:15.810 --> 10:18.608
Guess that makes it unanimous.

10:34.940 --> 10:36.431
You guys aren't bored
back there, are you?

10:36.531 --> 10:39.201
- No way, Charlie.
- This is really cool, Charlie.

10:39.301 --> 10:43.137
I think flying is, like,
the only way to fly.

10:44.575 --> 10:46.040
I'll have to remember that one.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.649
That was kind of stupid, Hannah.

10:47.749 --> 10:49.814
Shut up.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.487
All right, guys, down there,
that's Lake Wipissing.

10:57.587 --> 11:00.455
Your dad's mine's on the north end,
so we're not too far now.

11:00.555 --> 11:01.992
Yay.

11:02.092 --> 11:04.390
- Charlie, are you married?
- Nope.

11:04.490 --> 11:07.493
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

11:07.593 --> 11:11.139
You seem like a really nice
guy and relatively handsome.

11:11.239 --> 11:13.208
Thanks.

11:13.330 --> 11:15.712
I don't know why you
don't have a girlfriend.

11:15.812 --> 11:20.340
Well, I guess not too many girls
want to come all this way to visit.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.642
Maybe that's why Mom
didn't want to come.

11:22.742 --> 11:26.554
- That's not why.
- Shut up, Zach.

12:01.753 --> 12:03.288
What's happening?

12:03.388 --> 12:05.964
Just a little engine trouble, guys.

12:06.064 --> 12:07.990
Just stay calm, and...

12:08.571 --> 12:10.735
just make sure your
seat belts are on tight.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.844
Mayday, Mayday.
Cessna 1-8-0-Yankee-whiskey-kilo.

12:22.944 --> 12:25.683
Engine failure. Three souls aboard.

12:25.783 --> 12:28.183
Zach, I'm scared.

12:29.789 --> 12:31.185
Mayday, Mayday.

12:31.285 --> 12:33.028
Cessna 1-8-0-Yankee-whiskey-kilo.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.333
Declaring an emergency. Over.

12:44.299 --> 12:46.878
Are we going to die, Zach?

12:54.651 --> 12:56.722
Charlie, there's smoke coming in.

12:58.054 --> 12:59.779
Guys, we're going to have to
make an emergency landing, okay?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.853
I need for you to put your head
between your knees now, please.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.219
Don't worry, guys. This plane
was built to land on water,

13:14.320 --> 13:16.276
and the lake's just ahead of us.

13:21.010 --> 13:24.116
Guys, prepare for impact!

13:57.194 --> 14:00.217
Zach. Zach, are you okay?

14:01.297 --> 14:03.626
Are you okay?

14:05.371 --> 14:07.169
I think so. Are you okay?

14:07.269 --> 14:11.234
I'm okay. Charlie!

14:12.439 --> 14:14.944
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

14:15.044 --> 14:16.708
Charlie!

14:18.052 --> 14:20.321
We have to get out of here.
Can you undo your seat belt?

14:20.421 --> 14:22.281
Yeah.

14:28.764 --> 14:32.064
I can't get the door open.
It won't move.

14:35.237 --> 14:37.172
Try kicking it with both feet.

14:37.272 --> 14:38.934
Get down on our backs, okay? Ready?

14:39.034 --> 14:42.403
On three. One, two, three.

14:43.413 --> 14:46.338
- We did it.
- Okay, let's go.

14:52.878 --> 14:54.054
- Come on, Chinook.
- Come on, boy.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.025
Chinook.

14:58.255 --> 15:00.058
Zach...

15:00.694 --> 15:02.396
try your phone.

15:02.496 --> 15:04.530
It's busted.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.373
The radio. Try the radio.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.097
Good idea.

15:11.838 --> 15:13.871
Hello. 10-4.

15:13.971 --> 15:16.117
Come in, good buddy.

15:16.217 --> 15:18.249
It's a plane, Zach, not a truck.

15:18.349 --> 15:20.319
Well, I don't know what to say.

15:20.817 --> 15:23.724
Mayday, Mayday.
Is anybody out there?

15:23.824 --> 15:25.849
We need help. Our plane's crashed.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.095
Zach...

15:32.195 --> 15:35.494
is Charlie... is he dead?

15:37.808 --> 15:39.107
No. He's breathing.

15:39.207 --> 15:41.145
Charlie, wake up.

15:41.245 --> 15:43.306
Charlie, we need your help.

15:43.406 --> 15:45.847
Charlie, please!

15:48.715 --> 15:50.489
Come on.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.393
Come on, boy.

16:04.638 --> 16:05.799
What's that?

16:05.899 --> 16:07.906
It's the emergency bag
Charlie showed us.

16:08.006 --> 16:09.167
Oh, yeah.

16:09.267 --> 16:12.242
It's got enough food and
water to last us a few days.

16:12.342 --> 16:15.681
So we'll be okay, and they'll
come looking for us, right?

16:15.781 --> 16:17.579
I guess so.

16:17.679 --> 16:19.948
Daddy will come looking for us.

16:20.048 --> 16:21.583
He'll find us.

16:21.683 --> 16:23.916
But what about Charlie?

16:24.524 --> 16:26.019
He'll wake up soon.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.000
He'll be okay.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.464
No. No, you don't know that.

16:31.564 --> 16:33.697
He needs to go to the hospital.

16:33.797 --> 16:35.333
Okay, but what can we do?

16:35.433 --> 16:39.045
Well, Charlie said there was
a lake near here, right?

16:39.145 --> 16:41.471
Yeah, Lake Wipissing,
where Daddy's mine is.

16:41.571 --> 16:43.384
Maybe if we find the lake,

16:43.484 --> 16:45.475
we can find Dad's mine.
We can find Dad.

16:45.575 --> 16:48.584
And if we find Dad, we can
tell him about Charlie...

16:49.415 --> 16:52.890
before it's too late.

16:52.990 --> 16:55.625
But shouldn't we stay here?

16:56.357 --> 16:58.396
I don't know.

16:59.157 --> 17:01.390
No, we should help Charlie.

17:08.803 --> 17:10.578
Hey.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.635
We should leave the rest of the stuff
in the emergency bag for Charlie.

17:58.735 --> 18:00.562
Yeah. I'll do it.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.836
No. I'll do it.

18:46.450 --> 18:48.212
Bye, Charlie.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.085
Which way do we go?

18:53.185 --> 18:54.790
Well, Charlie was trying
to get to the lake,

18:54.890 --> 18:57.423
and he flew in that way, obviously.

18:57.523 --> 19:00.967
So we follow the line,
and we should get to the lake.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.922
Yeah.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.453
Ackerman Mines.
Robert Wade's office.

19:43.020 --> 19:45.624
Search and Rescue just called.

19:46.397 --> 19:48.527
They received a distress
call from Charlie's plane.

19:48.627 --> 19:51.022
Then it fell off the radar.

20:02.287 --> 20:05.384
Okay. I've updated the
third-quarter results

20:05.484 --> 20:08.195
for the Markdale Steel account.
Oh, hang on a second, Dave.

20:08.295 --> 20:09.985
I've got another call coming in.

20:10.592 --> 20:14.248
- Hello.
- Hey, Susan. It's me.

20:14.925 --> 20:18.027
Hi. Kids get there okay?

20:18.593 --> 20:21.682
Susan, there's a...
there's a problem.

20:22.261 --> 20:24.057
Search and Rescue
received a distress call

20:24.157 --> 20:26.520
from the plane, and then
they lost contact with it.

20:26.620 --> 20:29.523
What do you mean they lost contact?
What does that mean?

20:29.623 --> 20:30.687
We don't know what happened yet.

20:30.787 --> 20:32.419
Search and Rescue's
on their way right now.

20:32.519 --> 20:36.257
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:37.722 --> 20:39.088
I should have been with them.

20:39.188 --> 20:41.558
I mean, Hannah wanted
me to come with them.

20:42.359 --> 20:43.850
Can you get yourself to Goose Bay?

20:43.950 --> 20:45.316
Will you be able to drive?

20:45.416 --> 20:47.656
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming.
I'm on my way.

20:47.756 --> 20:50.748
I'm going to have a plane
waiting for you, okay?

20:51.245 --> 20:52.654
Yeah.

20:52.754 --> 20:54.445
Okay.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.351
Come on, boy.

21:06.513 --> 21:08.687
- Need a hand?
- Yeah.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.043
Zach, slow down.

21:25.143 --> 21:27.286
I'm so tired.

21:27.386 --> 21:29.643
All right, let's take a little break.

21:31.842 --> 21:33.782
Lie down.

21:35.441 --> 21:37.183
Okay, down, boy.

21:37.283 --> 21:38.912
Hey, hey, hey, lie down.

21:39.012 --> 21:40.979
Lie down.

21:42.349 --> 21:43.617
Zach, don't drink so much.

21:43.717 --> 21:45.488
We don't know how long
the water has to last.

21:45.588 --> 21:48.047
Hannah, relax. We're going
to a lake, remember?

21:48.147 --> 21:49.680
We'll have all the water we need.

21:49.780 --> 21:52.745
We're not there yet. We have
to be careful we don't run out.

21:56.343 --> 21:58.483
Are you sure we're still heading
in the right direction?

21:58.583 --> 22:00.947
Yeah, pretty sure.
I was following the sun,

22:01.047 --> 22:03.275
but it's kind of hard
to see it right now.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.806
What do you mean? Are we lost?

22:05.906 --> 22:07.343
No, we're not lost.

22:07.443 --> 22:11.348
We're just not exactly
sure where we're going.

22:12.038 --> 22:14.250
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

22:14.350 --> 22:17.075
I think we should go back to
the plane and wait with Charlie.

22:17.175 --> 22:19.939
There is no way we
can get back there.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.944
So we don't know where we're going,

22:22.044 --> 22:23.316
and we don't know where we came from.

22:23.416 --> 22:25.075
That sure sounds
like we're lost to me.

22:25.175 --> 22:26.444
We're not lost.

22:26.544 --> 22:28.339
All I need to do is
just find a clearing,

22:28.439 --> 22:29.738
and I'll know where I'm going.

22:29.838 --> 22:31.580
Where did you learn to do that?

22:31.680 --> 22:33.006
Cub Scouts.

22:33.106 --> 22:34.942
That doesn't fill me with confidence.

22:35.042 --> 22:38.103
"That doesn't fill
me with confidence."

22:41.715 --> 22:43.179
Zach, what are you doing?

22:43.279 --> 22:44.605
He's thirsty.

22:44.705 --> 22:46.446
He's spilling it all over the place.

22:46.546 --> 22:47.580
He's a dog.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.468
Zach!

22:50.240 --> 22:52.277
Come on, boy.

22:54.213 --> 22:57.172
- Zach.
- We'll find the lake.

22:57.272 --> 22:59.599
We'd better.

23:18.242 --> 23:20.177
They're here, Robert.

23:20.277 --> 23:22.267
Hi. I'm Robert Wade.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.744
Captain Walker,
Mountain Search and Rescue.

23:24.844 --> 23:26.172
This is Sergeant McCoy.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.472
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.645
This is Bill Peters,
my aviation manager.

23:29.745 --> 23:32.399
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi, Bill.

23:32.499 --> 23:34.535
So what can you tell us?

23:35.642 --> 23:37.298
Well, our best guess
is that the plane

23:37.398 --> 23:41.300
went down about 50 miles from here,
to the south, obviously.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.835
Our problem is that we can't tell

23:42.935 --> 23:45.009
how far off course the
pilot might have strayed.

23:45.109 --> 23:47.735
So, "best guess," does that
mean that you can't pinpoint

23:47.835 --> 23:49.509
exactly where the plane went down?

23:49.609 --> 23:52.331
We could, depending on the ELT.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.337
That's the emergency
locator transmitter.

23:54.437 --> 23:56.305
It sends out an automatic
distress signal.

23:56.405 --> 23:58.698
It's g-force-activated on impact.

23:58.798 --> 24:00.262
The newer ELTs are digital.

24:00.362 --> 24:03.002
They carry detailed information
about the aircraft and the owner,

24:03.102 --> 24:04.801
and they give precise
GPS coordinates.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.072
The exact location can
sometimes be pinpointed

24:07.172 --> 24:08.566
in as little as five minutes.

24:08.666 --> 24:10.836
Well, Charlie had one of those
on his plane, didn't he?

24:10.936 --> 24:13.634
No, Robert, we're still
using the analog ELTs.

24:13.734 --> 24:14.796
What?

24:14.896 --> 24:16.873
That technology is outdated.

24:16.973 --> 24:19.999
The signal is no longer
detectable by satellite,

24:20.099 --> 24:23.632
only ground-based receivers,
and that's if they're near one.

24:24.668 --> 24:27.170
Why didn't you upgrade
the planes, Bill?

24:27.270 --> 24:29.938
I've been fighting with
Ackerman on this for years.

24:30.038 --> 24:32.867
The analog ELTs are still legal.
You know the old man.

24:32.968 --> 24:35.626
He's never going to cough up for
new ones until he's forced to.

24:35.726 --> 24:38.331
- Well, you should have come to me.
- It wouldn't have been any use.

24:38.431 --> 24:40.908
Gentlemen, please.

24:41.008 --> 24:43.711
I'm sorry, Bill.
I know it's not your fault.

24:45.872 --> 24:47.718
Okay.

24:48.312 --> 24:50.850
Charlie and the kids...

24:51.555 --> 24:52.857
what are their chances?

24:52.957 --> 24:54.823
Well, our best-case scenario

24:54.923 --> 24:57.151
is that they had a
successful water landing.

24:57.251 --> 24:59.301
We know they've got enough
supplies in the plane

24:59.401 --> 25:01.503
to last them until we find them.

25:01.603 --> 25:04.169
But if they went down
in the forest...

25:05.235 --> 25:07.644
well, sometimes there are survivors.

25:08.044 --> 25:10.607
We're establishing a base
camp about a mile from here,

25:10.708 --> 25:12.737
we're gathering a team to
coordinate the search effort,

25:12.837 --> 25:15.087
and a helicopter is being
brought in from Goose Bay.

25:15.187 --> 25:17.984
- Okay, how long is that going to take?
- Three to four hours.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.992
My kids are out there.

25:20.092 --> 25:22.322
- I understand, Mr. Wade...
- No, you don't.

25:22.422 --> 25:24.955
Now, I have a chopper here.

25:25.055 --> 25:28.128
It'll be dark soon, and our helicopter
has thermal-imaging equipment.

25:28.228 --> 25:29.901
We can see people on the ground
right through the trees.

25:30.001 --> 25:32.607
Well, I'm sure it's going to come in
very handy when it finally gets here,

25:32.708 --> 25:35.174
but for now, we're going
to go looking for my kids.

25:36.975 --> 25:40.205
Yeah. Okay.

25:52.262 --> 25:54.660
I don't see any clearing. Do you?

25:59.095 --> 26:01.505
- We'll find one.
- What's wrong with Chinook?

26:01.605 --> 26:03.472
He's thirsty, just like me.

26:03.572 --> 26:05.037
Well, you're not getting
any of my water,

26:05.137 --> 26:06.674
'cause you wasted all yours.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.584
I know, Chinook. She's mean.

26:09.684 --> 26:12.147
Wait a minute.
Chinook, boy, you thirsty?

26:12.247 --> 26:14.046
You want a drink?
Huh? You want a drink?

26:14.146 --> 26:16.931
- You don't need to tease him.
- I'm not. I saw this dog on TV

26:17.031 --> 26:18.952
that could find water
by scent, by smelling it,

26:19.052 --> 26:21.836
so I thought Chinook could find
the lake by sniffing it out.

26:21.936 --> 26:25.236
- Pretty good.
- Go get water.

26:27.702 --> 26:30.032
- Let's follow him.
- Let's follow him.

26:39.511 --> 26:41.253
We're approaching the
south end of the lake.

26:41.353 --> 26:45.694
According to the timetable,
Charlie should have made it this far.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.797
I don't see anything.

26:53.897 --> 26:57.543
Well, there's no debris.
That could be a good sign.

27:02.906 --> 27:05.190
I'm going to fly over the bush

27:05.290 --> 27:07.952
while we still have some light.

27:10.654 --> 27:14.522
It's going to be really tough
to spot anything down there.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.143
I don't know, Hannah.
I don't think this is going to work.

27:21.243 --> 27:23.444
Maybe...

27:23.544 --> 27:26.078
and I don't want to lose Chinook.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.216
Well, you better call him.

27:28.783 --> 27:31.122
Why do I have to call him?

27:31.222 --> 27:32.787
'Cause I can barely breathe.

27:32.887 --> 27:34.393
Well, it was your idea.

27:34.493 --> 27:36.915
You shouldn't believe
everything you see on TV.

27:37.015 --> 27:39.290
Well, you thought it was a good idea.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.737
Well, I was just being supportive.

27:58.276 --> 27:59.452
Good job, boy!

27:59.552 --> 28:02.020
You did it, Chinook!
You found the lake!

28:02.517 --> 28:04.515
- Whoa!
- You found it.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.990
Good job, boy.

28:44.403 --> 28:46.215
You know what?

28:46.315 --> 28:48.382
Water's a really good drink.

28:56.392 --> 28:59.192
It's so beautiful.

29:05.761 --> 29:08.531
Should be enough for now.

29:08.631 --> 29:11.264
Thanks.

29:12.178 --> 29:14.909
Oh, no. Chinook's running off again.
Come on, let's go.

29:15.643 --> 29:16.818
Get back here, Chinook!

29:16.918 --> 29:19.248
Come on, boy!

29:31.333 --> 29:33.866
Chinook!

29:33.966 --> 29:35.972
Where are you going?

29:36.072 --> 29:38.208
Chinook.

30:00.231 --> 30:01.697
It's a cave.

30:01.797 --> 30:04.511
Did you make sure there's
no bear in there?

30:04.611 --> 30:08.146
He's home, but he's very friendly.

30:09.447 --> 30:11.551
Come on. You'll like it.

30:11.651 --> 30:14.077
Okay.

30:37.278 --> 30:40.980
Wow. It's huge.

30:44.623 --> 30:46.385
Need a hand?

31:05.746 --> 31:07.657
Pretty nice, huh?

31:07.757 --> 31:10.682
Yeah. It's a lot bigger
from the inside.

31:11.221 --> 31:14.088
Exactly, we're out of the wind,
and if it rains, we're covered.

31:14.188 --> 31:16.291
But it's cold.

31:16.391 --> 31:18.590
It's all right. I'll make a fire,

31:18.690 --> 31:20.592
and Chinook can keep us warm.

31:21.034 --> 31:23.263
Are you sure there's no bear in here?

31:23.363 --> 31:26.510
I already told you he's friendly.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.682
I'm just kidding.
There's no bear.

31:48.006 --> 31:49.733
We're ready to head out, sir.

31:49.833 --> 31:51.965
You know I can't force you
to go out there all night.

31:52.065 --> 31:53.170
It's going to be dangerous.

31:53.270 --> 31:55.846
Yeah, well, I had no trouble
finding any volunteers,

31:55.946 --> 31:56.984
and when there's kids out there,

31:57.084 --> 31:58.619
we're going to search
as long as we have to.

31:58.719 --> 32:00.351
Remember, I have kids of my own.

32:00.451 --> 32:02.320
Okay, just keep in touch constantly.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.355
- Yes.
- And don't take any chances.

32:05.455 --> 32:08.727
- We'll be fine.
- All right.

32:09.489 --> 32:12.164
Sergeant McCoy, you're with me.

32:18.443 --> 32:20.633
This is a good fire, Zach.

32:22.946 --> 32:24.078
Thanks.

32:24.178 --> 32:27.472
Good thing we had those
matches in the emergency bag.

32:27.572 --> 32:30.049
I could have started it
without the matches.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.640
And let me guess.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.884
You learned how to do
that at Cub Scouts.

32:33.984 --> 32:36.214
Yep.

32:37.778 --> 32:40.244
One sandwich each for dinner.

32:41.115 --> 32:43.522
What about Chinook?

32:43.622 --> 32:45.576
I guess he gets some too.

32:47.388 --> 32:49.121
Only fair.

32:49.784 --> 32:52.320
You really liked Cub
Scouts, didn't you?

32:52.886 --> 32:54.089
I guess it was okay.

32:54.189 --> 32:55.985
So why did you quit?

32:56.085 --> 32:58.326
I didn't quit. Dad did.

32:58.426 --> 33:00.029
What do you mean?

33:00.129 --> 33:02.521
Well, he's the one who signed me up.

33:02.621 --> 33:03.988
We were going to do
all this cool stuff,

33:04.088 --> 33:06.024
like camping and contests and stuff,

33:06.124 --> 33:08.986
but he was always too busy,
and all the other dads went,

33:09.086 --> 33:11.152
and I felt like a stupid orphan.

33:11.692 --> 33:14.429
Well, his work is just
so far away, Zach.

33:14.529 --> 33:17.436
Well, remember how he was
coming on the weekends?

33:17.536 --> 33:19.558
Still never did.

33:21.427 --> 33:23.265
It's just because he's so busy.

33:23.365 --> 33:25.528
Yeah, well, he's always busy.

33:56.476 --> 33:57.844
Hey.

33:57.944 --> 33:59.409
No luck, I assume.

33:59.509 --> 34:00.947
No, nothing.

34:01.047 --> 34:03.319
What do you think their chances are?

34:03.982 --> 34:06.180
We got plane wrecks
up there from the '60s

34:06.280 --> 34:07.719
that we still haven't found.

34:07.819 --> 34:09.507
Really?

34:10.380 --> 34:11.678
Might as well be the Amazon.

34:11.777 --> 34:13.353
This forest is just as dense.

34:13.454 --> 34:15.583
That's provided they
survived impact, of course.

34:15.683 --> 34:18.289
Oh, those poor kids,
they're so young.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.121
Yeah, and we got another concern.

34:22.221 --> 34:23.795
What's that?

34:23.895 --> 34:27.484
Mating season for the grizzlies.

34:28.159 --> 34:33.024
Males will be on the prowl,
very grumpy, looking for a fight.

34:34.061 --> 34:37.496
Well, let's just hope
we find them first.

34:49.831 --> 34:52.129
Are they really getting
divorced, Zach?

34:52.228 --> 34:54.571
I think so.

34:55.262 --> 34:56.741
But why?

34:56.841 --> 35:00.702
I know Mom was always complaining
about Dad being away so much,

35:00.802 --> 35:04.440
but maybe now she wants
him to stay away.

35:04.540 --> 35:08.197
Or Dad just doesn't want
to be around Mom...

35:10.841 --> 35:12.407
or us.

35:13.375 --> 35:15.504
Is it our fault?

35:15.604 --> 35:17.444
Did we do something wrong?

35:17.544 --> 35:20.813
No, no, of course not. No.

35:21.780 --> 35:23.743
Well, we fight a lot.

35:23.843 --> 35:26.653
Hannah, they're not going to get
divorced 'cause we fight a lot.

35:26.753 --> 35:28.679
How do you know?

35:34.452 --> 35:37.084
What is it, boy?

35:40.877 --> 35:43.326
Hannah, there's
something in the cave.

35:43.426 --> 35:46.487
Is it a bear?

35:47.648 --> 35:48.823
How should I know?

35:48.923 --> 35:50.581
You said there wasn't a bear in here.

35:50.681 --> 35:52.217
Well, I didn't go all the way back.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.058
That wasn't very thorough.

35:54.158 --> 35:57.717
Get away from me!

35:59.558 --> 36:01.429
Get away from me!

36:03.256 --> 36:07.060
It was birds, just birds.
Just birds, no bear.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.889
How do you know that?

36:08.989 --> 36:11.497
What if the bear scared the birds?

36:12.035 --> 36:14.303
I better go get Chinook.

36:14.403 --> 36:16.630
Wait. Wait.
Do you hear that?

36:16.730 --> 36:18.306
Do you hear that?

36:18.406 --> 36:21.199
- Hear what?
- A helicopter!

36:21.299 --> 36:24.001
- Zach, there's a helicopter!
- Come on!

36:30.565 --> 36:34.444
- Where is it?
- It's up there!

36:36.699 --> 36:39.271
- Hey! We're down here!
- We're down here!

36:39.371 --> 36:41.170
- We're down here!
- We're down here!

36:41.270 --> 36:44.312
- Hello! We're down here!
- Over here!

36:44.412 --> 36:46.709
- We're down here!
- Down here! Come on!

36:46.809 --> 36:48.772
- Down here!
- Come on down!

36:48.872 --> 36:50.642
- We're down here!
- We're down here! We're here!

36:50.742 --> 36:52.248
- Here!
- We're here!

36:52.348 --> 36:53.715
We're down here!

36:53.815 --> 36:55.475
- We're down here!
- We're down here!

36:55.575 --> 36:56.983
Hello!

36:57.083 --> 37:00.284
We're down here! Whoops!

37:04.381 --> 37:07.522
We're down here! Hello!

37:07.622 --> 37:09.784
Look over here!

37:12.745 --> 37:14.087
- We're down here!
- Down here!

37:14.187 --> 37:16.888
- We're down here!
- Come here!

37:35.858 --> 37:38.420
At least we know
they're looking for us.

37:59.843 --> 38:02.139
- No luck, Mr. Wade?
- No, nothing.

38:02.239 --> 38:05.670
Well, as you know, our main chopper

38:05.770 --> 38:07.442
started a search a couple hours ago.

38:07.542 --> 38:09.271
Did they spot anything
with the infrared?

38:09.371 --> 38:11.873
No, just wildlife.

38:11.973 --> 38:13.575
We're going to have
them stay out tonight

38:13.675 --> 38:16.448
as long as their fuel lasts,
and in the morning...

38:17.250 --> 38:19.644
we'll be sending in
additional teams on foot.

38:19.744 --> 38:20.779
- Okay.
- Okay?

38:20.879 --> 38:22.578
My children have to spend
the night out there?

38:22.678 --> 38:25.487
Susan. Captain Walker,
this is my wife Susan.

38:25.587 --> 38:28.477
Mrs. Wade.
At this point, yes,

38:28.577 --> 38:30.514
it looks like the kids
will be out all night.

38:30.614 --> 38:32.784
Well, how cold will it get?

38:32.884 --> 38:34.612
Just a few degrees colder than here.

38:34.712 --> 38:37.118
Looks like it's going to
stay above freezing,

38:37.218 --> 38:40.150
so as long as they stay in the plane
or find some form of shelter,

38:40.250 --> 38:42.687
they will be at minimal
risk of exposure.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.781
Minimal risk?

38:46.248 --> 38:47.726
Yes, ma'am.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.093
What about the emergency
locator transmitter?

38:50.193 --> 38:51.562
Has that been any help at all?

38:51.662 --> 38:54.360
No, we lost the signal.
It died.

38:54.460 --> 38:55.565
Well, how'd that happen?

38:55.665 --> 38:58.957
It must have been damaged
or a short circuit.

38:59.057 --> 39:00.355
Anyway, the battery died.

39:00.455 --> 39:02.835
It sometimes happens with
these older analog ELTs.

39:02.935 --> 39:04.469
But if that plane had
modern equipment,

39:04.569 --> 39:05.921
we would have found our kids by now.

39:06.021 --> 39:09.930
- Isn't that right, Captain Walker?
- How do you know about all this?

39:10.496 --> 39:12.491
Sheila told me.

39:13.237 --> 39:14.869
Quite possibly, yes.

39:14.969 --> 39:16.406
So what are we going to do?

39:16.506 --> 39:18.966
Well, at this point,
the important thing is to stay calm.

39:19.066 --> 39:21.531
Would you be calm if it were
your children out there?

39:21.631 --> 39:25.080
No, I would not,
but rest assured, Mrs. Wade,

39:25.180 --> 39:28.414
we are doing everything
we can to find your children.

39:29.190 --> 39:31.091
Fine.

39:33.462 --> 39:35.568
Susan.

39:35.668 --> 39:37.528
What, Robert?

39:38.303 --> 39:40.368
Where are you going?

39:40.468 --> 39:41.975
They set me up in a trailer.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.042
I'm going to go back
there and not sleep.

39:44.142 --> 39:45.555
Well, there's a canteen here.

39:45.655 --> 39:48.721
Do you want to go get a
hot meal or cup of coffee?

39:49.719 --> 39:52.963
No. I'm just going to
go back to the trailer.

39:53.063 --> 39:54.767
I'll see you in the morning.

39:54.867 --> 39:57.169
Susan.

40:00.913 --> 40:02.993
We're going to get our
kids back. I promise.

40:03.093 --> 40:05.090
Don't.

40:06.032 --> 40:08.030
No more promises.

40:15.145 --> 40:16.322
Was it worth it?

40:16.422 --> 40:18.125
Was what worth it?

40:18.225 --> 40:20.317
All of this...

40:20.417 --> 40:22.134
your job, the money,

40:22.234 --> 40:24.357
all this time away from your family?

40:25.494 --> 40:27.908
It's already ruined our marriage.

40:29.669 --> 40:32.513
Now maybe we're going
to lose our kids too.

40:33.552 --> 40:35.620
Is it worth it?

41:13.557 --> 41:15.844
I don't think we'll
ever find Daddy's mine.

41:15.944 --> 41:17.302
Maybe it's too far away.

41:17.402 --> 41:19.950
Yeah, maybe.

41:20.050 --> 41:21.780
I don't think we should
stay here either.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.781
They've already looked here.

41:24.891 --> 41:28.162
Hey, do you see that
flat thing up there?

41:28.262 --> 41:29.633
Yeah.

41:29.733 --> 41:33.280
That big flat area-looking thing?

41:33.380 --> 41:35.277
You mean like a plateau?

41:35.377 --> 41:38.083
Yes, brainiac, like a plateau.

41:38.554 --> 41:41.160
Maybe if we get up there,

41:41.260 --> 41:44.797
they'll be able to see us,
they can find us.

41:45.836 --> 41:49.472
- Yeah, let's go.
- All right.

42:07.878 --> 42:11.745
Now, we believe the plane went
down somewhere in this area,

42:11.845 --> 42:14.315
so we've divided the map into six.

42:14.829 --> 42:17.196
There will be six teams,
each assigned

42:17.296 --> 42:18.999
your particular section of the grid.

42:19.099 --> 42:20.498
Now, you've all got your maps?

42:20.598 --> 42:22.275
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Gear checked out?

42:22.375 --> 42:25.205
- You bet.
- Good. Any questions?

42:26.577 --> 42:28.225
So let's go get this done, people.

42:28.325 --> 42:30.362
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

42:30.462 --> 42:32.793
Morning, Mrs. Wade.

42:33.430 --> 42:36.977
Captain Walker, we want to
join one of the search teams.

42:37.077 --> 42:41.046
I'm afraid I can't let you do that,
even if I wanted to.

42:41.947 --> 42:45.453
Look, every one of these rangers
is certified and highly trained.

42:45.553 --> 42:47.353
Well, come on.
We can walk through the woods

42:47.453 --> 42:48.992
as well as any of those guys.

42:49.092 --> 42:53.400
And get lost or hurt or worse,
and then I'd have to find you.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.676
Would you want me diverting resources
from the search for your children?

42:55.776 --> 42:58.075
Of course not, but we're not
going to sit here doing nothing.

42:58.175 --> 43:00.324
Look, folks, I know
how difficult it is.

43:00.424 --> 43:02.751
No, I don't think you do.

43:02.851 --> 43:04.735
I've got to go.

43:04.835 --> 43:07.498
I know you want me to do my job.

43:11.007 --> 43:13.211
Come on. We're going up
in the company chopper.

43:13.311 --> 43:15.253
Let's go.

43:19.622 --> 43:21.592
I was just looking for you, Robert.

43:22.257 --> 43:23.738
Bill, can we get the chopper up?

43:23.838 --> 43:25.707
It's back at the hangar.
The mechanics found

43:25.807 --> 43:27.842
a pretty severe oil
leak this morning.

43:27.942 --> 43:30.146
Well, how long is it
going to take to fix?

43:30.246 --> 43:32.213
May be some engine damage.
Could be a couple of days.

43:32.313 --> 43:34.224
Well, if the chopper's
in such bad shape,

43:34.324 --> 43:36.360
how well did you take
care of Charlie's plane?

43:36.460 --> 43:39.231
Ackerman's cut us down to a
skeleton crew. You know that.

43:39.331 --> 43:41.230
I also know Charlie Foster,
and that plane

43:41.330 --> 43:43.104
did not go down because
of pilot error.

43:43.204 --> 43:44.740
You're right.

43:44.840 --> 43:49.181
We're doing the best we can,
but maybe it's not enough.

43:50.888 --> 43:52.592
Oh, my God.
What are we going to do now?

43:52.692 --> 43:54.897
I don't know.

43:55.437 --> 43:57.946
Maybe Walker's right.
Maybe we ought to just stay put

43:58.046 --> 43:59.401
and let the professionals
do their job.

43:59.501 --> 44:01.412
Those are my children
out there, Robert.

44:01.512 --> 44:03.077
Well, they're my kids too, Susan.

44:03.177 --> 44:06.424
You think I'm not scared
to death right now?

44:07.921 --> 44:11.899
I'm sorry. It's just that those two
can barely be left alone at home.

44:11.999 --> 44:16.038
They're not equipped to deal with trying
to survive out there in the woods.

44:16.536 --> 44:18.988
Well, you know, Charlie's with 'em.
He's going to take care of them,

44:19.088 --> 44:22.081
and they have Chinook, who's going
to give them all kinds of protection.

44:22.181 --> 44:23.619
You got to be kidding me.

44:23.719 --> 44:25.992
That dog hid under Zach's
bed for an hour last week

44:26.092 --> 44:28.629
after I scolded him for
chewing up a newspaper.

44:28.729 --> 44:33.539
Look, I get your point, but we
got to stay positive about this.

44:33.639 --> 44:35.980
We have got to believe
that Charlie, Hannah,

44:36.080 --> 44:37.885
and Zach are going to come back okay.

44:40.825 --> 44:42.960
I hope you're right.

44:44.691 --> 44:46.128
Okay.

44:46.228 --> 44:48.266
Come on.

44:49.706 --> 44:51.771
Come on, boy.
This way.

45:11.957 --> 45:13.021
Wow, huh?

45:13.121 --> 45:16.960
Yeah, how are we going
to get across this?

45:17.818 --> 45:20.590
I don't know. There must be
another way downstream.

45:32.476 --> 45:34.431
Let's go.

45:45.985 --> 45:48.077
We can cross here.

45:50.348 --> 45:52.719
Be careful, Zach.

45:53.951 --> 45:55.684
Yeah.

45:57.664 --> 45:59.228
Come on, boy.
Come on, go.

45:59.328 --> 46:01.028
Come on, boy!
Come on.

46:01.128 --> 46:03.693
- Go, bud.
- Come on, boy.

46:04.135 --> 46:06.062
Good boy.
Right there.

46:07.142 --> 46:09.498
All right, toss me your pack.

46:13.569 --> 46:15.469
You scared?

46:24.349 --> 46:26.345
Come on.

46:32.690 --> 46:35.753
Okay, I don't have all day.

46:36.223 --> 46:38.525
Shut up, Zach!

46:42.333 --> 46:43.632
Hannah!

46:43.732 --> 46:46.227
Help me!

46:56.341 --> 46:57.986
Help me!

46:58.086 --> 46:59.944
Hannah!

47:05.651 --> 47:08.686
Help! Help me!

47:22.402 --> 47:24.896
Help me!

47:36.782 --> 47:39.083
Hannah!

47:40.552 --> 47:42.488
Hannah! Hannah!

47:42.588 --> 47:44.456
Are you okay?

47:44.556 --> 47:46.686
I think I hurt my ankle.

47:46.786 --> 47:49.027
- You seem really cold.
- I'm freezing.

47:49.127 --> 47:51.623
All right, we need to
make a fire, and fast.

47:52.855 --> 47:54.962
Chinook saved my life.

48:09.938 --> 48:12.613
I really made a mess
of things, didn't I?

48:13.083 --> 48:15.343
You really want to get
into this right now?

48:19.817 --> 48:22.686
I love them so much.

48:24.528 --> 48:27.156
Yeah.

48:27.256 --> 48:29.253
Me too.

48:30.457 --> 48:31.700
I love you too.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.197
Oh, Robert, please.

48:33.297 --> 48:35.067
No...

48:35.167 --> 48:36.867
I want to be a family again.

48:36.967 --> 48:38.240
I'll quit my job up here.

48:38.340 --> 48:41.362
I'll get something close to home.
I don't care.

48:42.608 --> 48:45.173
I just want to try again.
Please.

48:45.712 --> 48:47.109
I can't talk about this right now.

48:47.209 --> 48:51.685
All I can think about is getting
Zach and Hannah home safely.

48:54.453 --> 48:56.155
How's your ankle feeling?

48:56.255 --> 48:57.623
It's really sore.

48:57.723 --> 48:59.984
I think I might have sprained it.

49:00.592 --> 49:04.190
I'm so stupid. I shouldn't
have made you cross the river.

49:04.290 --> 49:07.060
You didn't make me. I have a
mind of my own, you know.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.468
Yeah, well, I could
have gotten you killed.

49:10.568 --> 49:11.965
I'm supposed to look after you.

49:12.065 --> 49:14.097
Well, you're looking after me,

49:14.197 --> 49:16.371
I'm looking after you,
and guess what.

49:16.471 --> 49:17.908
What?

49:18.008 --> 49:20.197
Chinook is looking after both of us.

49:21.734 --> 49:23.032
You can say that again.

49:23.132 --> 49:25.138
Chinook is looking after both of us.

49:25.238 --> 49:26.745
Okay, I didn't mean it literally.

49:26.845 --> 49:28.976
Chinook is looking after both of us.

49:29.076 --> 49:30.654
Okay, I think three times is enough.

49:30.754 --> 49:33.983
- Chinook is looking after...
- All right.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.414
I'm going to grab some more firewood.

49:37.514 --> 49:39.993
- Take Chinook with you.
- No, you need him.

49:40.093 --> 49:42.352
I'll be fine, Zach.

49:42.919 --> 49:45.188
Okay. Come on, boy.

49:45.288 --> 49:47.090
Let's go.

50:18.595 --> 50:20.356
Zach?

51:11.937 --> 51:14.802
Get away from me!

51:14.902 --> 51:16.510
Go away!

51:17.271 --> 51:19.503
- Get away from me!
- Hannah?

51:20.804 --> 51:23.586
Go!

51:23.686 --> 51:25.682
Hannah!

51:31.985 --> 51:34.756
Go!

51:39.453 --> 51:41.962
Get away from me!

51:42.765 --> 51:45.301
Get out!

51:54.208 --> 51:56.243
Are you okay?

51:56.343 --> 51:57.974
Yeah.

51:58.074 --> 52:00.440
What did you throw at that wolf?

52:00.540 --> 52:01.853
A baseball.

52:01.953 --> 52:04.845
There was a baseball
in the emergency pack?

52:04.945 --> 52:07.591
No, it's my baseball, the one
that I hit the home run with.

52:07.691 --> 52:09.515
The super slam?

52:09.615 --> 52:11.123
Grand slam.

52:11.223 --> 52:13.755
Oh. Well, good thing you brought it.

52:13.855 --> 52:16.596
I thought it'd come in handy
if I had to throw it at a wolf.

52:16.696 --> 52:18.701
Good thinking.

52:18.801 --> 52:21.362
Here, boy. Come here.
How are you?

52:21.462 --> 52:23.662
All right, we need
to get out of here.

52:23.762 --> 52:26.630
Let's go, bud. Let's go.

52:30.204 --> 52:31.336
Base to chopper.

52:31.436 --> 52:33.402
Any signs of the wreckage?
Over.

52:33.502 --> 52:34.703
Negative, base.

52:34.803 --> 52:36.838
Proceeding to sector 3G. Over.

52:36.938 --> 52:38.670
Roger that.

52:45.722 --> 52:48.524
Whoa.
Come on, boy.

52:49.589 --> 52:52.026
Come on.

52:52.126 --> 52:54.164
Come on. Come on.

52:59.803 --> 53:01.730
Come on.
Come on, bud.

53:06.510 --> 53:08.880
Come on. Come on, help me.

53:15.849 --> 53:17.856
Base camp, this is red team leader.

53:17.956 --> 53:20.626
There is no sign of the
targets here in sector 5B.

53:20.726 --> 53:23.529
We're going to head
southeast to Pine Ridge.

53:25.093 --> 53:26.557
Roger that, team leader.

53:26.657 --> 53:28.501
Proceeding to Pine Ridge.
Over.

53:28.601 --> 53:31.705
Copy that, base camp. Over.

53:49.787 --> 53:52.029
Ouch! Ouch!

53:52.129 --> 53:54.690
Are you okay?

53:54.790 --> 53:58.228
No. My ankle really hurts.
I don't think I can walk.

53:58.670 --> 54:00.234
Go on. Leave me here.

54:00.334 --> 54:02.339
Are you kidding me?

54:02.439 --> 54:04.835
Yes! If you left me here,
I'd kill you!

54:04.935 --> 54:07.970
Funny.

54:09.341 --> 54:12.220
Ouch.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.411
I have an idea.
Hold on to Chinook.

54:14.511 --> 54:16.645
Boy, good boy.

56:50.189 --> 56:51.614
Come here, boy.
Come here.

56:51.714 --> 56:53.584
I need you.

57:05.293 --> 57:06.871
Zach, what's that?

57:06.971 --> 57:09.106
It's called a travois.

57:10.434 --> 57:11.611
It's kind of like a sled.

57:11.711 --> 57:14.105
So Chinook's going to pull me?

57:14.205 --> 57:17.040
Well, remember how Charlie
said Chinook was a working dog.

57:17.140 --> 57:19.777
Well, this will be
his first real job.

57:25.526 --> 57:27.426
Grab on to my arm.

57:28.353 --> 57:30.321
Can you get on?

57:34.699 --> 57:36.998
So you learned to make
this in Cub Scouts?

57:37.098 --> 57:38.202
Yep.

57:38.302 --> 57:39.767
You definitely shouldn't have quit.

57:39.867 --> 57:41.903
You could have become a Beagle Scout.

57:42.003 --> 57:44.636
It's Eagle, not Beagle.

57:45.509 --> 57:47.446
All right, you ready, boy?

57:47.546 --> 57:48.679
You ready?

57:48.779 --> 57:51.414
- I'm not sure I'm ready.
- Let's go!

58:04.826 --> 58:08.333
- Does your ankle hurt?
- No, my bum.

58:13.876 --> 58:16.105
At what point do we
call in the military?

58:16.205 --> 58:19.651
Mr. Wade, this is not
a military operation.

58:19.751 --> 58:23.116
The local police are already assisting
us with two of their choppers.

58:23.216 --> 58:24.847
Two choppers? Two?

58:24.947 --> 58:26.262
Captain Walker, Robert's right.

58:26.362 --> 58:28.187
I mean, surely in a
situation like this,

58:28.287 --> 58:29.754
we need every available aircraft.

58:29.854 --> 58:31.291
I agree with my wife.

58:31.391 --> 58:34.036
Mr. and Mrs. Wade,
we have more resources

58:34.136 --> 58:35.961
on this search than any other

58:36.061 --> 58:37.931
Search and Rescue
operation in my career.

58:38.031 --> 58:42.030
We have volunteer teams out at night
because there are children involved.

58:42.130 --> 58:45.038
We have systematically
searched the entire area

58:45.138 --> 58:47.117
where we think the plane
could have gone down,

58:47.217 --> 58:48.709
and we will keep on searching

58:48.809 --> 58:51.510
until we find your
children and the pilot.

58:51.610 --> 58:53.685
Look, I'm sorry, Captain.
We're not suggesting

58:53.785 --> 58:55.626
that your people aren't
doing their jobs.

58:55.726 --> 58:58.826
Of course we appreciate everything
that the volunteers are doing,

58:58.926 --> 59:01.893
but our children may be
running out of time here.

59:03.390 --> 59:05.325
What can we do that
we're not already doing?

59:05.425 --> 59:07.697
If there was something
additional we could be doing,

59:07.797 --> 59:10.897
we would be doing it.
Trust me.

59:10.997 --> 59:12.671
In situations like this,

59:12.771 --> 59:16.639
it's often about
persistence and patience.

59:17.081 --> 59:18.575
This is no time to panic.

59:18.675 --> 59:22.177
But we haven't had
one inkling of hope,

59:22.277 --> 59:25.743
not one indication that
our children are still alive.

59:26.324 --> 59:28.484
It's a big wilderness
out there, Mr. Wade,

59:28.584 --> 59:31.060
but this is a big operation.

59:31.160 --> 59:33.961
We will find your kids.

01:00:17.903 --> 01:00:20.647
Guys, it's here!
Come on!

01:00:24.886 --> 01:00:26.980
Here.

01:00:29.682 --> 01:00:31.216
Charlie. Charlie.
Take some.

01:00:31.316 --> 01:00:33.162
The kids aren't here.

01:00:37.595 --> 01:00:39.962
Base camp, this is red team leader.

01:00:40.062 --> 01:00:42.940
We have found the plane.
Repeat... we have found the plane.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.269
Roger that, team leader.

01:00:45.369 --> 01:00:47.103
Go get the Wades.

01:00:48.376 --> 01:00:50.813
Are there any survivors? Over.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.309
Charlie.

01:00:52.409 --> 01:00:54.014
I thought you'd never get here.

01:00:54.114 --> 01:00:55.745
Do you copy, team leader?

01:00:55.845 --> 01:00:58.217
Here.

01:00:58.852 --> 01:01:00.683
Drink some more.

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:02.689
Do you copy, team leader?

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:04.920
Are there any survivors?
Over.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.127
Drink some water.

01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:16.467
So aside from being not dead,
how are you, buddy?

01:01:17.533 --> 01:01:19.208
I think my legs are broken.

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:22.976
Base camp, pilot is
alive and conscious,

01:01:23.076 --> 01:01:26.454
appears to have
nonlife-threatening injuries.

01:01:26.554 --> 01:01:30.127
Request immediate medical evac. Over.

01:01:30.227 --> 01:01:32.817
Roger that, team leader.
Over.

01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:35.886
- You found the plane!
- What about our kids?

01:01:35.986 --> 01:01:37.160
The pilot has survived.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.658
We're still waiting for
status on the children.

01:01:40.251 --> 01:01:43.557
Team leader, what's the
status on the minors,

01:01:43.657 --> 01:01:46.452
Hannah and Zach Wade?
Over.

01:01:46.552 --> 01:01:48.519
Base camp, stand by.

01:01:49.417 --> 01:01:51.865
Charlie, where are the kids?

01:01:51.965 --> 01:01:53.830
Give me the...
give me the radio.

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:56.397
- What?
- Give me the radio.

01:01:58.264 --> 01:02:02.055
This is Charlie.
I want to talk to Robert. Over.

01:02:02.155 --> 01:02:03.758
Charlie, it's Robert.

01:02:03.858 --> 01:02:05.558
Thank God you're okay.

01:02:05.658 --> 01:02:07.123
Where's Zach?
Where's Hannah?

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:08.965
- Over.
- Over.

01:02:09.065 --> 01:02:12.860
I think they're all right,
Robert, but they're not here.

01:02:13.592 --> 01:02:15.263
They left the site. Over.

01:02:15.363 --> 01:02:17.536
Charlie, what do you mean they left?
Where did they go?

01:02:17.636 --> 01:02:19.569
- Over.
- Over.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:23.462
When I came to, dog and
the kids, they were gone.

01:02:23.562 --> 01:02:26.160
Okay, they... they took

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.403
some emergency supplies,

01:02:28.503 --> 01:02:31.200
and Hannah, she...

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.402
she left me a note.

01:02:33.502 --> 01:02:35.429
They went to get help...

01:02:36.326 --> 01:02:39.263
for me. Over.

01:02:39.704 --> 01:02:41.672
Oh, my God.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.436
Wow, look at this.

01:03:09.045 --> 01:03:10.804
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:03:46.788 --> 01:03:49.281
This is a good place to stay tonight.

01:03:57.214 --> 01:03:59.015
What is it, boy?

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:09.688
Hannah, there's fish here!

01:04:09.788 --> 01:04:10.849
What kind?

01:04:10.949 --> 01:04:14.093
I don't know. The big kind.

01:04:16.322 --> 01:04:18.657
They're salmon, Zach.
Catch one.

01:04:18.757 --> 01:04:21.017
Okay. Give me my fishing rod.

01:04:21.928 --> 01:04:23.993
I'm serious, Zach.

01:04:24.684 --> 01:04:27.188
They come upriver at this
time of the year to spawn.

01:04:27.288 --> 01:04:28.488
To what?

01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:30.357
To lay their eggs.
After that, they're really tired

01:04:30.457 --> 01:04:33.460
and so slow that you can catch
'em with your bare hands.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.590
I learned it on TV.
Come on, Zach. I'm starving.

01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:42.256
Okay. I'll try.

01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:48.223
Get 'em.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.200
Get it.

01:04:55.602 --> 01:04:57.791
- What? No! Don't let it go!
- Crap!

01:05:01.459 --> 01:05:03.136
Get him.

01:05:04.297 --> 01:05:06.329
Squeeze. Come on.

01:05:06.429 --> 01:05:08.006
Squeeze him tight.
Get him! Get him!

01:05:08.106 --> 01:05:10.460
No, you don't. Crap.

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:17.770
No, you...

01:05:18.863 --> 01:05:21.131
Oh.

01:05:21.231 --> 01:05:22.963
I got one!

01:05:32.945 --> 01:05:35.101
The fishy!

01:05:35.201 --> 01:05:37.274
Oh, fishy! Fishy!

01:05:37.374 --> 01:05:39.038
I can get him.

01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:53.446
- It's upside down.
- I got him.

01:05:53.546 --> 01:05:55.611
- Let's eat.
- Whoo!

01:05:57.741 --> 01:06:00.107
- Charlie. Charlie!
- Hey.

01:06:00.207 --> 01:06:01.878
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Charlie.

01:06:01.978 --> 01:06:04.580
I don't know what happened.
I'm so sorry.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.251
Charlie, you landed that airplane.

01:06:07.351 --> 01:06:10.809
As far as I'm concerned,
you saved our kids' lives.

01:06:10.909 --> 01:06:12.974
No word yet?

01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:15.882
No. No, not yet.

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:19.143
They're smart kids, and they...

01:06:19.243 --> 01:06:21.350
they got the perfect dog with them.

01:06:23.315 --> 01:06:25.514
- Chinook?
- You think so?

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.217
I know so.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.947
Ms. Wade.

01:06:29.047 --> 01:06:30.858
You've got to start calling me Susan.

01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:33.078
Susan.

01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:38.418
What is it?

01:06:38.518 --> 01:06:40.093
"Hi, Charlie.

01:06:40.193 --> 01:06:43.255
Zach and Chinook and
I are all okay...

01:06:43.987 --> 01:06:47.916
but you're hurt, and we
have to go find a doctor.

01:06:48.016 --> 01:06:50.621
We'll be back soon. Hannah."

01:06:56.185 --> 01:06:57.691
Take care, Charlie.

01:06:57.791 --> 01:06:59.786
Thank you.

01:07:32.863 --> 01:07:34.830
This is really good, Zach.

01:07:35.258 --> 01:07:37.267
Yeah.

01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:42.370
And I think Chinook likes it too.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.661
Don't you, boy? Don't you?

01:07:45.532 --> 01:07:48.006
I didn't know you had to clean
a fish before you cooked it,

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:49.930
and I didn't know it'd be so gross.

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:53.075
They didn't teach you how to
clean a fish in brainiac school?

01:07:53.175 --> 01:07:56.299
No, and I don't want to hear
any more about Cub Scouts.

01:07:56.399 --> 01:07:57.836
That's not where I learned it.

01:07:57.936 --> 01:08:01.078
Remember two years ago,
the fishing trip Dad took me on?

01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:04.346
- Oh, yeah.
- He taught me.

01:08:04.446 --> 01:08:07.238
And that was the last time I actually
spent a whole weekend with him.

01:08:07.338 --> 01:08:09.275
They must be really worried about us.

01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:12.043
- Mom and Dad?
- Yeah.

01:08:12.143 --> 01:08:14.204
Mom might.

01:08:14.304 --> 01:08:15.809
They both are, Zach.

01:08:15.909 --> 01:08:18.707
If you say so.

01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:37.408
What do you mean you're removing
resources from the search?

01:08:37.508 --> 01:08:39.845
I've got three hikers
lost on the east ridge.

01:08:39.944 --> 01:08:42.758
I've got a family of four capsized
their canoe in Gull Lake.

01:08:42.858 --> 01:08:45.792
We are so close.
They found the plane.

01:08:45.892 --> 01:08:48.662
But your children
left the crash site,

01:08:48.763 --> 01:08:50.256
and, frankly, because of that,

01:08:50.356 --> 01:08:52.434
our chances for success
are greatly diminished.

01:08:52.533 --> 01:08:54.568
They could have gone anywhere.

01:08:54.667 --> 01:08:56.037
That's where you're wrong.

01:08:56.136 --> 01:08:58.408
My son was a Cub Scout
for almost three years.

01:08:58.508 --> 01:09:00.611
He learned survival skills.
He knows orientation.

01:09:00.711 --> 01:09:02.249
He can find his way in the woods.

01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:06.158
Mrs. Wade, with all due
respect, a Cub Scout?

01:09:06.258 --> 01:09:07.558
Listen to me.

01:09:07.658 --> 01:09:09.192
Look, if they were
looking for a doctor,

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:10.786
they would go where there are people.

01:09:10.886 --> 01:09:14.562
We need to be looking between
the crash site and the camp.

01:09:15.227 --> 01:09:18.134
That's a good theory.
I will take that into consideration.

01:09:18.234 --> 01:09:20.607
Now, please, I've got work to do.

01:09:32.555 --> 01:09:34.756
Susan.

01:09:34.856 --> 01:09:36.393
What you said makes perfect sense.

01:09:36.493 --> 01:09:37.959
Good.

01:09:38.059 --> 01:09:39.636
Then find us a vehicle.

01:09:39.736 --> 01:09:42.408
I want to go back to the mining camp
and start our search from there.

01:09:42.508 --> 01:09:43.877
Okay. Bill Peters is coming up soon.

01:09:43.978 --> 01:09:45.709
We'll take his jeep or
whatever else he brings.

01:09:45.809 --> 01:09:48.148
Great. I'll be in my trailer.

01:09:48.247 --> 01:09:50.185
Susan.

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:52.685
Zach quit Cub Scouts?

01:09:53.944 --> 01:09:55.260
He did.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.727
I thought he liked it.

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:00.195
He did,

01:10:00.295 --> 01:10:02.399
but you should know that,
shouldn't you?

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:04.703
I should, yeah.

01:10:05.133 --> 01:10:06.808
He also loved baseball.

01:10:06.908 --> 01:10:09.279
He actually hit his first
home run last week.

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:13.742
He was so excited to tell you all
about it, but you didn't have time.

01:10:14.989 --> 01:10:17.023
Zach quit Cub Scouts
because he was embarrassed

01:10:17.123 --> 01:10:19.315
that his father was never around.

01:10:26.038 --> 01:10:28.932
All right, let's take a break here.

01:10:29.032 --> 01:10:32.333
Yeah. I like it here.
It's pretty.

01:10:33.081 --> 01:10:34.870
Come here, boy.

01:10:54.069 --> 01:10:55.842
I'm kind of sick of granola bars.

01:10:55.942 --> 01:10:57.936
Yeah, me too.

01:11:36.572 --> 01:11:38.902
Hey. Zach, look.

01:11:40.274 --> 01:11:43.172
Hey, get out of here!
Get out!

01:11:46.983 --> 01:11:48.952
Get out!

01:11:53.554 --> 01:11:55.621
He ate my last granola bar.

01:12:02.704 --> 01:12:06.013
Aw, it's so cute. I wish
I had one as a pet.

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.943
Yeah. It'd eat us out
of house and home.

01:12:12.047 --> 01:12:14.428
No, Chinook.
You'll scare the poor thing.

01:12:14.528 --> 01:12:15.788
Good boy.

01:12:15.888 --> 01:12:17.589
Oh, Zach, don't be so mean.

01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:20.365
You practically rang
the dinner bell for it.

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:24.978
All right, let's get a move on.

01:12:25.078 --> 01:12:27.435
Bye, little friend.

01:12:38.122 --> 01:12:39.995
Come on, bud.

01:13:03.061 --> 01:13:05.601
We can see for miles up here.

01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:09.732
Zach, what's that?

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.129
Fire?

01:13:13.209 --> 01:13:16.246
Hannah, we've got a serious
problem on our hands.

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:19.144
Let's get out of here.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.548
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:40.280
Great news.

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.052
Just heard from the hospital,
and Charlie's going to be okay.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:46.021
He's going to be laid up for a
while while his legs heal, but...

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:49.152
That's great news. Poor Charlie.
I can't imagine

01:13:49.252 --> 01:13:52.160
what it was like for him out
there in pain all that time.

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.474
Well, the important thing
is that he survived, and...

01:13:55.574 --> 01:13:57.497
now we know that Zach
and Hannah survived.

01:13:57.597 --> 01:14:00.136
For me, it's a major miracle.

01:14:01.244 --> 01:14:03.750
Where are they, Robert?

01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:05.654
Where are they?

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.950
They could be anywhere.

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:10.085
I mean, they could have
wandered off anywhere.

01:14:10.185 --> 01:14:12.718
They thought about going
to get help for Charlie,

01:14:12.818 --> 01:14:15.398
and, to me, that says that
we raised them right.

01:14:17.339 --> 01:14:19.128
Yeah.

01:14:19.903 --> 01:14:21.800
Susan...

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.575
we are going to find them.
I promise you.

01:14:28.776 --> 01:14:31.244
Yeah.

01:14:47.143 --> 01:14:49.912
- What are you doing, Chinook?
- What is it, boy? What is it?

01:14:50.012 --> 01:14:52.645
- Why won't he go forward?
- Come on, go. Go.

01:14:52.745 --> 01:14:55.546
Chinook. Chinook.

01:15:29.896 --> 01:15:32.171
Run!

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:03.917
Where is it?

01:16:08.255 --> 01:16:10.460
Go, go, go!

01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:14.300
Get in. Come on.

01:16:24.849 --> 01:16:27.747
No! Help!

01:16:44.313 --> 01:16:46.074
Look out!

01:16:56.026 --> 01:16:59.035
Help!

01:17:18.193 --> 01:17:20.120
Go away, bear!

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:38.124
Is it gone?

01:17:38.224 --> 01:17:40.859
I don't know.

01:17:42.523 --> 01:17:43.600
Where's Chinook?

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.567
Chinook!
Chinook, boy, come here!

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:47.860
Chinook, boy, where are you?

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:49.768
- Chinook!
- Chinook.

01:17:49.868 --> 01:17:51.406
- Come here, boy.
- There you are, boy.

01:17:51.506 --> 01:17:53.650
Chinook. Chinook.

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:55.646
- Chinook.
- Bring him over.

01:17:55.746 --> 01:17:57.755
Hey, buddy.

01:17:57.855 --> 01:18:00.614
Missed you.
Where did you go?

01:18:02.456 --> 01:18:04.655
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:18:04.755 --> 01:18:07.027
I'm sorry, Mr. Wade.
The search is over.

01:18:07.127 --> 01:18:09.991
- I have to pull my teams out.
- Why?

01:18:10.091 --> 01:18:12.068
A forest fire is
engulfing the valley.

01:18:12.168 --> 01:18:14.706
I have no choice.
I've got to go. I'm sorry.

01:18:57.031 --> 01:19:00.242
If we go higher,
the air will be better.

01:19:00.342 --> 01:19:02.736
Yeah, this is it.

01:19:02.836 --> 01:19:04.039
The plateau?

01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:06.116
Yeah. They'll be sure to
find us from up here.

01:19:06.216 --> 01:19:07.877
- We did it.
- We did it.

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:09.580
- We did it.
- Yes.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.756
I can't believe we did it.
We're actually here.

01:19:11.856 --> 01:19:13.584
We're here, boy.
We're here.

01:19:13.684 --> 01:19:15.082
- We're here, boy.
- We're here.

01:19:15.182 --> 01:19:17.492
Boy. Here, boy. Here.

01:19:17.592 --> 01:19:19.363
We're here, buddy.

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:21.524
We're here.
Yeah, we're here.

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:23.962
We're here, buddy.
We did it, boy. Yay, we did it.

01:19:24.062 --> 01:19:26.234
We did it, boy.
Come here.

01:19:26.334 --> 01:19:27.800
- Would you two calm down?
- We did it. No, we did it.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:30.668
We did it. Yay!
We're here, buddy.

01:19:30.768 --> 01:19:33.831
- We're here!
- Would you two calm down?

01:19:34.868 --> 01:19:37.364
Zach!

01:19:42.573 --> 01:19:45.312
Zach?
Zach, are you okay?

01:19:45.412 --> 01:19:48.720
I'm okay, but there's no room.
I can't move.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.121
You have to find help.

01:19:50.221 --> 01:19:53.089
Zach, I won't leave you here.

01:20:04.768 --> 01:20:06.764
It's all up to you now, boy.

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.639
You have to help us.
Now go.

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:12.999
Go, buddy! Go!

01:20:15.339 --> 01:20:18.305
Go, Chinook! Go!

01:20:20.812 --> 01:20:23.806
Go! Go!

01:20:42.231 --> 01:20:44.930
- Zach.
- Yeah?

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:46.538
Don't look down.

01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:48.270
Okay, thanks.

01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:50.237
- Zach.
- Yeah?

01:20:50.337 --> 01:20:52.010
Let's talk about something.

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:53.879
What do you want to talk about?

01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:55.376
Anything you want.

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:58.175
Let's talk about RC helicopters.

01:20:58.275 --> 01:21:01.181
I can't talk about RC helicopters.

01:21:01.281 --> 01:21:03.288
Okay. Then what do
you want to talk about?

01:21:03.388 --> 01:21:05.449
Let's talk about ballet.

01:21:05.549 --> 01:21:07.781
Oh, boy.

01:22:35.066 --> 01:22:37.866
Look, we're going to
find a way, okay?

01:22:56.513 --> 01:23:00.075
Robert!

01:23:22.463 --> 01:23:25.138
Robert, Chinook!

01:23:30.541 --> 01:23:33.410
Chinook.
Come here, Chinook.

01:23:34.849 --> 01:23:37.188
Come on.

01:23:37.288 --> 01:23:38.780
- Chin...
- Let's follow him.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.656
Come on, let's follow him.

01:23:47.721 --> 01:23:50.198
- Zach.
- Yeah?

01:23:50.298 --> 01:23:52.026
Do you know who likes you?

01:23:52.126 --> 01:23:53.661
No.

01:23:53.761 --> 01:23:56.035
Jennifer. She told me.

01:23:57.224 --> 01:23:58.829
Oh. Okay.

01:23:58.929 --> 01:24:00.408
Do you like her?

01:24:00.508 --> 01:24:02.598
I guess she's okay.

01:24:02.698 --> 01:24:05.775
She really, really likes you.

01:24:07.769 --> 01:24:11.303
- I'd rather talk about ballet.
- Okay.

01:24:24.616 --> 01:24:27.121
Chinook! Zach, it's Chinook!

01:24:27.221 --> 01:24:29.495
And he brought help, Zach!

01:24:31.294 --> 01:24:33.467
Hi, boy.

01:24:33.567 --> 01:24:35.632
Hi.

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:38.639
Mommy! Daddy!

01:24:40.231 --> 01:24:42.532
- Mommy! Daddy!
- Hannah!

01:24:43.431 --> 01:24:45.303
Thank God, baby.

01:24:46.202 --> 01:24:47.473
- Where's Zach?
- You okay?

01:24:47.573 --> 01:24:49.473
- I'm okay.
- Where's Zach?

01:24:50.483 --> 01:24:52.186
- Where's your brother?
- Down there.

01:24:52.286 --> 01:24:54.073
He's not okay.

01:25:00.584 --> 01:25:03.494
It's okay.

01:25:04.352 --> 01:25:07.826
- Zach?
- Dad, is that you?

01:25:07.926 --> 01:25:10.325
Zach.

01:25:10.988 --> 01:25:13.493
I'm here. Are you hurt?

01:25:13.593 --> 01:25:16.666
No, but if I move, I...

01:25:16.766 --> 01:25:19.539
Don't move. Don't move.

01:25:21.436 --> 01:25:23.640
I'm going to come down and get you.

01:25:27.241 --> 01:25:29.550
- Hey.
- Susan. Susan.

01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:31.946
- What?
- I'm going to go down there.

01:25:32.046 --> 01:25:33.845
I'm going to get Zach back,
but I need your help.

01:25:33.945 --> 01:25:36.048
- What do you want me to do?
- Drive.

01:25:36.148 --> 01:25:38.284
Okay, Hannah, you come with me.

01:25:39.156 --> 01:25:40.888
Okay.

01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:54.729
Okay, don't get too
close to the edge.

01:25:55.199 --> 01:25:59.436
I'm going to tell you what
I want your mom to do,

01:25:59.536 --> 01:26:00.712
and you're going to tell her,

01:26:00.812 --> 01:26:02.780
- okay?
- Okay.

01:26:06.741 --> 01:26:08.751
Okay.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.611
- Okay. Tighten it up!
- All right.

01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:26.357
Oh. How's that?

01:26:26.457 --> 01:26:29.062
Just stay right there.

01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:34.439
Okay, forward.

01:26:38.703 --> 01:26:41.669
Forward.
Keep coming.

01:26:48.043 --> 01:26:49.850
That's it, son.

01:26:50.896 --> 01:26:53.135
Keep coming.

01:26:58.301 --> 01:27:00.957
- Okay.
- Get that.

01:27:01.057 --> 01:27:02.864
Okay. You okay?

01:27:02.964 --> 01:27:06.540
- Yeah.
- You're okay, pal. It's okay.

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:09.699
You're okay.

01:27:09.799 --> 01:27:13.387
I'm going to get your
legs in this, all right?

01:27:13.487 --> 01:27:15.601
Step in there.

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:18.218
That's it.
Now step in the other side.

01:27:18.318 --> 01:27:20.862
Hold on to me.

01:27:22.632 --> 01:27:25.260
Okay, look, you're going
to turn around,

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:28.474
put your feet into the cliff,
and then lean back on me,

01:27:28.574 --> 01:27:30.147
and then we're going to go up, okay?

01:27:30.247 --> 01:27:31.386
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:27:31.486 --> 01:27:33.737
Hey, I'm not going to let you fall.

01:27:33.837 --> 01:27:36.006
Okay.

01:27:36.106 --> 01:27:37.315
All right.

01:27:37.415 --> 01:27:39.973
Hannah, pull back slowly.

01:27:40.073 --> 01:27:41.045
Slowly.

01:27:41.145 --> 01:27:43.481
Backwards!
Keep going.

01:27:43.581 --> 01:27:45.529
All right.

01:27:46.434 --> 01:27:48.410
Okay, you ready?

01:27:51.098 --> 01:27:53.071
How's that?

01:27:53.171 --> 01:27:54.547
Yeah?

01:27:54.647 --> 01:27:56.231
Now just go. Walk.

01:27:56.331 --> 01:27:58.263
Walk. That's it.

01:27:58.363 --> 01:28:00.311
Is that okay?

01:28:01.313 --> 01:28:03.289
How's that?

01:28:04.808 --> 01:28:08.286
Backwards. Backwards.
Keep going.

01:28:08.997 --> 01:28:10.610
You're good. That's it.

01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:13.114
Just sit back, and walk.
Sit back, and walk.

01:28:13.214 --> 01:28:15.163
Sit back, and walk,
all your weight back at me.

01:28:15.263 --> 01:28:16.832
Let it pull you up.

01:28:16.932 --> 01:28:19.547
That's it. You're doing good.

01:28:22.137 --> 01:28:25.143
Keep going. You can do it.
That's it.

01:28:26.161 --> 01:28:27.857
That's it.

01:28:30.851 --> 01:28:32.686
Lean back in.

01:28:32.786 --> 01:28:35.639
Attaboy. That's it.

01:28:39.926 --> 01:28:41.177
Okay, watch out. Okay, stop!

01:28:41.277 --> 01:28:44.449
- Stop!
- Okay.

01:28:49.113 --> 01:28:50.558
- Oh, baby.
- Mom!

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:53.706
Baby, come here!
Oh, God.

01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:57.031
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:28:57.131 --> 01:29:00.247
Are you okay?

01:29:00.347 --> 01:29:02.851
Oh, my God.

01:29:04.731 --> 01:29:07.818
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:29:07.918 --> 01:29:09.963
- We're here, okay?
- Yeah.

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:15.657
Hey, come here.
Come here.

01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:17.673
Got to get out of here.

01:29:17.773 --> 01:29:19.677
- Hop in, guys. Hop in.
- Come here, boy.

01:29:19.777 --> 01:29:21.722
- Chinook. Up. Up.
- Seat belts.

01:29:21.822 --> 01:29:23.435
Come on, boy.
Come on, up.

01:29:23.535 --> 01:29:25.177
Good boy. I got you.
I got you, boy.

01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:26.748
You ready to go home?

01:29:26.848 --> 01:29:28.865
You mean all of us?

01:29:28.965 --> 01:29:30.927
Yeah...

01:29:31.027 --> 01:29:33.287
all of us.

01:29:37.659 --> 01:29:39.486
Let's go.
