[Stevie crying]
-Shh, shh, shh, shh.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.720
Shh, shh. It's OK.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.120
[woman] I was fun. I was really...
I was sharp.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.560
I was, like, funny,
and I now I just feel really blah.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.520
Like, I think I'm just missing
the party version of me.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.240
Like, especially this week,
I've just been feeling quite brain dead.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.360
Yeah.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.080
Oh, that really resonates. [chuckling]

00:33.160 --> 00:34.760
-Hi.
[woman] Hello. [counsellor] Welcome. What's your name?

00:38.400 --> 00:39.800
-Audrey.
-Audrey.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.240
[all] Hi, Audrey.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.840
Oh, Audrey! Scott from the back lane.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.760
-Oh! Hi!
-How are ya? -How are you?
-Yeah, good.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.440
Where am I?

00:49.520 --> 00:50.520
Oh, wow.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.000
Um, I've got the wrong...

00:54.280 --> 00:55.400
What day is it?

00:55.480 --> 00:56.720
It's Tuesday.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.000
Ah.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.960
I am so sorry.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.680
I've got the wrong meeting. [chuckles]

01:02.760 --> 01:05.280
Well, you're welcome to stay.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.640
I mean, there's no judgements here.
You don't have to speak.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.120
-You can just listen.
[Scott] Sit down.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.880
Sit down. Sit down.
It's one of my regulars.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.160
[counsellor] Scott!
-No, I'm not.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.640
Ah! Denial.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.040
Thank you. I am so sorry.
I'll just go now.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.560
Oh, she's asleep. I'll stay.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.080
Um, just for a bit, if that's OK.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.400
Ooh, carrot cake.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.640
-Later.
-OK.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.720
There was such a... like, a willingness
to share. It was really refreshing.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.480
Yeah, it's full-on, though, hey?
It gets pretty real.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.200
But, hey, I'll miss seeing you around
when I'm doing the...

01:38.280 --> 01:39.720
Oh, you still driving this one around?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.360
Yeah, haven't cracked the sleeping.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.560
No, I'm still dealing.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.720
Oh, no, fuck yeah.
I'm still dealing. Yeah.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.000
I just want to get to a place
where I'm not eating my profits.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.200
-Do you know what I mean?
-Wow.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.240
-It must be tricky.
-Yeah. It's not good.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.760
Have you thought about
a different sales job?

01:52.840 --> 01:55.240
No, no. Sales?
I mean, with this profit margin

01:55.320 --> 01:57.080
it would literally be a crime
not to do it.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.160
You know what I mean? -Hi.
-Hey.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.840
Hi, Audrey, want to come for a laksa? Actually, why not?

02:03.160 --> 02:06.080
<i>♪ Anything can happen</i>
<i>when you're just like me ♪</i> ♪<i> I'm running carelessly</i>
<i>through a maze...</i> ♪

02:09.160 --> 02:11.920
[trivia guy] So, I need a bonus question
for a round of drinks.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.880
Answers on the back
of your coasters, please.

02:13.960 --> 02:19.080
One of Beethoven's piano concertos
was nicknamed the <i> Moonlight Sonata.</i>

02:19.160 --> 02:21.400
-Which one?
-Number three. Yep.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.800
-Really?
-Yep, number three.<i> Moonlight S...</i>

02:25.840 --> 02:27.720
<i>-Moonlight Sonata.</i>
-No, that's not right. That's not it.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.360
-That's not it.
-Change it, then.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
No, that's not it.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.760
-Well, touch it...
-Nah. Nah.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.440
[trivia guy] Alright,
if you'd written number 14...

02:34.520 --> 02:36.320
-Fourteen. Fourteen
-...you'd be A, correct...

02:36.400 --> 02:38.360
-[Emma sighs]
-...and B, a total nerd.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.280
[Audrey laughs] Oh, hi.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.640
Sorry, guys,
last-minute all-staff meeting.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.200
-Lots of fun.
[Emma] Oh, I hate those.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.680
Aud, you're lucky you don't have to
deal with that crap anymore.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.520
[gasps] Maybe I should have a kid.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.720
Done.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.480
Nah. [laughs]

02:51.560 --> 02:54.040
If I'm getting bored at home,
you would be, like...

02:59.200 --> 03:00.800
even more bored.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.800
-Yeah.
-Where are my words?

03:04.880 --> 03:07.400
Hey, come in and see us
at work sometime.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.520
I will. That's a good idea.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.520
Hey, is everything OK at work?

03:11.600 --> 03:14.240
Yeah. Yeah. How we going?

03:14.320 --> 03:16.840
Uh, we were leading,
thanks to these guys.

03:16.920 --> 03:20.320
But then we missed a finance-y
and then a Mozart-y one.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.560
[Jeremy] Yeah?
-Beethoven.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.240
And we missed a Lady Di question.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.000
Oh, kindergarten teacher?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.040
-Yes. You're incredible.
-We're tied.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.240
[trivia guy] OK, round three,
question one.

03:31.320 --> 03:36.400
Name two countries
landlocked by two countries only.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.480
Your category, Audrey. This is all you.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.280
Oh, god, two countries only.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.600
[Emma] Come on, Aud. Bring it home.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.680
Um...

03:43.440 --> 03:44.480
[Jeremy] Landlocked.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.000
Landlocked. Two countries.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.840
Two count... [sighs]

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
Um...

03:51.920 --> 03:53.520
I should know this. Yep.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.800
Yep, you should know this, Audrey.

03:55.880 --> 03:56.960
-I just said that.
-Yes.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.560
[Emma] No,
just do your visualisation thing!

03:58.640 --> 03:59.680
-See the map.
-OK, yes I see...

03:59.760 --> 04:01.640
-You seeing it?
-It's just a bit blurry. I just...

04:01.720 --> 04:02.880
My memory...

04:02.960 --> 04:04.360
It's just like I'm buffering.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.400
-It will come.
[Pete] I'm gonna lose my meat tray.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.240
It's not your meat tray,
it's our meat tray,

04:08.320 --> 04:10.120
and we're not gonna lose it,
because I'm a geography whiz.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.320
I am thinking. OK?

04:11.400 --> 04:13.040
[Pete] Yes, think harder, is all I'm...

04:13.120 --> 04:14.440
[Jeremy] Hey.
[Pete] Yes.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.560
[Stevie cries]

04:15.640 --> 04:16.880
I'm just getting her dummy. [whispers] She's tired.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.079
[Pete] It's a Balkan country, I know that.
[Jeremy] Yeah?

04:22.840 --> 04:24.720
-Um...
-Landlocked. [Emma] No access to the water.
[Pete] Landlocked by two.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.400
[Jeremy] No access to the water.
[Audrey] Landlocked by two countries only.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.480
-[clears throat]
-Siri.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.840
[Jeremy] Need to go to another country.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.080
[Emma] By two countries, that would be...
[Pete] It may be in Africa.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.800
[Jeremy] That's fine. There's, like...
-Siri, repeat question.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.680
[Siri] <i> Here's what I found on the web for</i>

04:38.760 --> 04:42.120
<i>"What two countries</i>
<i>are landlocked by two countries only?"</i>

04:42.200 --> 04:43.240
Thank you, Siri.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.320
[phone beeps]

04:47.160 --> 04:50.360
That's an automatic disqualification.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.040
[Audrey sniggers]

04:52.120 --> 04:53.840
Yeah, yeah, whatever. [chuckles]

04:56.840 --> 04:58.320
Aud.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.480
-You want a suspension?
-Sure.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.720
[Audrey clears throat]
-No, we didn't know, I swear.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.920
We were just trying to work it out.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
-That's a one-week suspension.
-Ooh, tough guy.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.400
I can make it two.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.800
Don't care, 'cause everyone just
googles things nowadays anyway.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.240
I bet you just googled these questions.
No-one needs to have the...

05:16.760 --> 05:19.920
OK, OK. I'm done. Sorry. Sorry.
Can you please not suspend me?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.680
That's a disqualification
for the High Brows.

05:21.760 --> 05:22.960
[Pete] Fuck!

05:24.200 --> 05:27.280
Fuck it. OK, is this disqualification,
just to be clear,

05:27.360 --> 05:31.200
for this lady, or is it for all of us?

05:31.280 --> 05:32.360
Can I join another team?

05:32.440 --> 05:33.440
All of you.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.040
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.880
OK, you can come back next week.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.160
The numbers aren't strong enough
to really keep you out of it too long.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.760
[Pete] Thanks, mate. Appreciate it.
[Jeremy] Thanks very much. Appreciate it.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.280
[crickets chirp]

05:45.360 --> 05:47.160
[Ruben] I am surprisingly nervous.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.640
Excited nervous.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.400
Oh, you needn't be.
You're going to be great.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.240
Can you pop on the jacket?

06:01.440 --> 06:02.760
[Ruben sighs]
[Ester] Oh!

06:03.360 --> 06:05.280
God, you look good in a suit.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.360
[Ester moans]
-I'm close. Are you close?

06:09.440 --> 06:10.440
No.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.360
-What, you're not?
-No.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.680
This usually works.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.520
Yeah, but it's not working.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.280
Can you do something?

06:17.360 --> 06:20.240
Can you just... just hold me?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.120
Yeah. Yeah.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.360
No, not gentle. I mean, like, harder.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.080
You know, like, just grab me.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.560
Just grab you... like asphyxiation?

06:31.640 --> 06:35.560
No, I don't mean strangle me, Ruben.
I just mean, you know, rough it up a bit.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.720
OK. Just wait, wait, wait.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.720
OK. What about, um...
OK, what about that? Huh?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.760
-What about that? You like that!
-Oh!

06:43.840 --> 06:46.840
Yes! Now we're cooking. Aren't we? Yes.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.560
-Can you shut up? Shut up.
-Huh?

06:48.640 --> 06:49.960
Just stop talking.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.640
[both grunt and moan]

06:51.720 --> 06:53.480
I'm close. You've gotta be close.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.560
I'm not... I'm not close.

06:55.640 --> 06:56.920
-You're not?
-No.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.840
Fuck. Do you want me to go...

06:58.920 --> 07:01.920
-I'll go down on you.
-No, I can vaginally orgasm.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.400
I know. You're very luck... lucky.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.240
[heavy breathing]

07:07.320 --> 07:08.920
It's not luck. It's anatomical.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.680
Did you just cum?

07:11.760 --> 07:12.880
[heavy breathing]

07:12.960 --> 07:15.560
Um, I think I... I think I might have.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.480
Yeah, I think I did.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.440
[Ester sighs]
-Do you want me to...

07:24.520 --> 07:25.520
[Ester] Uh-uh...

07:25.600 --> 07:27.960

[Ambrose] And there are other benefits
to touch.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.760
It stimulates
their central nervous system,

07:50.840 --> 07:52.600
their digestive system, their brain.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.960
Are the babies gonna do us next?
Only fair.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.200
I have a very sore neck, Stevie.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.000
I seriously need something.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.960
Like, a technique for mental stimulation.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.840
Yes! I'm starting to think
I fell over in the birthing suite.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.640
-I feel permanently concussed.
[Georgia] Really?

08:07.360 --> 08:08.880
I feel more creative than ever.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.520
Like, I was up all night
editing my birthing video.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.760
It's pretty gruesome.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.000
I actually try and do Sudoku daily.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.920
Is that the one with all the numbers?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Only nine. Oh.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.920
Oh, yeah, and I highly recommend
the caption contest in <i> The New Yorker.</i>

08:23.000 --> 08:24.160
Wanker.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.640
-Sorry?
-Hmm?

08:25.720 --> 08:27.960
[Audrey] Yeah,
I can't afford another subscription.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.320
I'll email you the page.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.120
Thank you. That is so nice.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.558
I've got a good feeling about this week.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.240
No point, love. Baby brain.
It's gone for good.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.520
Oh, surely that's a myth.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.320
No, it's not.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.440
I'm telling you,
I have absolutely no memory

08:40.520 --> 08:42.280
of dropping the twins off
at school today.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.920
I know I dropped Jakey off,
but Jesse, I don't know.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.960
He could be in the car.
He could be at home. Who knows?

08:47.040 --> 08:49.680
But the baby brain...

08:49.760 --> 08:52.200
You can...
You can back-train it, right?

08:52.280 --> 08:53.920
-Nah.
-I hope so. What?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.520
It's gone. Nah, gone for good.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.040
I don't know. I feel like
I'm getting sharper everyday.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.720
Oh, right, so you've recovered
from your labour?

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
Yeah.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.520
And your cervix has bounced back? It's a parent group, Barbara.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.640
Oh, god, I've got to go.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.720
Got to get this one to a babysitter.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.960
Got my interview today. [grunts]

09:13.040 --> 09:14.640
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.080
-See you, guys.
-Bye.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.400
-Bye.
-Good luck.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.840
-He looks weird in a suit, yeah?
-Mm-hm.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.920
Should we tell him
that he smells of baby vomit?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.440
[all] Nah.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.200
I think Jessie might be in the car.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.040
-You should check.
-I should check. I should check.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.800
-Can you just watch her?
-I've got her. Yep.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.440
I left the window down,
but just quickly have a look.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.680
[Ruben] Yeah, fascinating guy.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.400
Hasn't seen his mum for 20 years

09:40.480 --> 09:43.760
because she refuses to leave the village
where she grew up in Syria

09:43.840 --> 09:47.280
and she thinks she'd be more unsafe here
than back there.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.360
Can you believe that?
Do you take many Ubers?

09:49.440 --> 09:50.560
No.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.760
Taxi man? Bicycle man?

09:52.840 --> 09:56.880
OK, so you've been managing what?
Net worth?

09:56.960 --> 10:00.360
Um, Michael,
typically I'd be managing portfolios

10:00.440 --> 10:04.320
between three and five million
with an annual revenue, 25 to 40.

10:04.400 --> 10:08.160
Look, it's Angus. Angus Michaels.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.240
Oh, pardon me.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.080
You must get that a lot
with the two first names.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.600
Well, no, because it's Michaels,
not Michael, so.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.880
My... My mistake, yeah.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.080
Just looking globally for a second--

10:19.160 --> 10:21.000
Can I just ask,
how long do you think we're gonna be?

10:21.080 --> 10:25.040
It's just... it's Eva's first day with
a daytime babysitter, and, uh...

10:25.120 --> 10:26.120
I didn't know you--

10:26.200 --> 10:28.600
...I was hoping to get back
towards the end of her sleep.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.880
Ester never mentioned a baby.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.840
I like to sing her a wake-up song.
Sort of a reverse lullaby.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.320
It sounds stupid,
but she really does actually...

10:35.400 --> 10:37.440
-Congrats.
-...respond to it. Thank you.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.680
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
I mean, keep going.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.680
I mean, maybe you could give me
a signal when we're almost done

10:42.760 --> 10:44.400
and I could just book the Uber.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.560
Can we just get back to the...

10:47.440 --> 10:51.240
So, Ruben, where do you
see yourself in five years?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.480
Ooh, uh...

10:56.120 --> 10:57.280
Can I pass?

10:57.360 --> 10:58.400
No.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.800
Yeah, I'm nearly there.
So, I will see you soon.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.760
-Oh!
[Emma] <i> Oh, shit, you're here!</i>

11:05.840 --> 11:08.640
I didn't really mean now, now.
We're off to a meeting.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.520
-Oh, OK.
-Do you remember Aud?

11:10.600 --> 11:13.320
-Yeah, of course. She hired me. Hi.
-Hi, Sally. How are you?

11:13.400 --> 11:14.960
-I'm good.
-Good.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.520
-Phone.
-Oh.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.640
[all laugh]
-God.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.600
-Um, I'll just get a coffee.
-Yeah, great idea.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.080
-How long will you be?
-Oh, we won't be long.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.160
-OK, well, who are you off to...
-Lord Mayor.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.400
Yeah, Sally's been asked
to draft a speech on, um--

11:26.480 --> 11:28.000
-For the Lord Mayor?
-Yeah!

11:28.080 --> 11:31.360
-Good for you!
-Thanks. Oh, Em, we really need to fly.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.360
-Yeah, OK. I'll see you in a bit
at the cafe.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.440
Bye, baby.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.040
Oh, so, uh,
it says here you've had 12 months off.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.560
Have you put that to good use
on your own little nest egg?

11:43.640 --> 11:44.640
Oh, no.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.760
Oh, come on. Let me know.
Tell me. What have you got?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.960
-No, no, I haven't.
-What's it... Ten mil?

11:49.040 --> 11:50.200
-No.
- More?

11:50.280 --> 11:51.600
-Nah.
-Whoa. Cagey.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.960
[laughter]

11:53.040 --> 11:55.400
-No, what are you interested in?
-You are not getting that out of me.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.880
Come on. Tell me. What's it up to?

11:56.960 --> 11:59.240
-100 mil? More?
-No, I can't.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.720
Seriously,
what have you been investing in?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.800
It gives me a clear indication
of what your potential is.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.160
Oh, I haven't been investing
in anything.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.640
I haven't got a portfolio.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.040
Why... [sighs] Why were you...

12:10.280 --> 12:13.280
I just wanted to make it
look like I had been.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.000
I actually just needed a break
from all the clients. You know?

12:16.080 --> 12:17.360
Um...

12:17.440 --> 12:21.200
It's been good, and the self-medication.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.640
Coke still rife?

12:22.720 --> 12:25.440
We're a family business, so...

12:25.520 --> 12:27.200
Oh, good. Well, that's good.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.200
Well, probably wouldn't need it anyway.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.000
I'm much calmer these days.
Could be the, um, hormones.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.360
Kidding. Although, they do say, oestrogen,

12:35.440 --> 12:38.600
you do get a bit of a kick of oestrogen
when you're looking after kids. Hopefully not too much,
although that would be handy.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.520
Sorry, can we just get back
to the interview?

12:46.360 --> 12:48.760
You know what I've gone and done?
I've booked the Uber. Probably when I was showing you
the app before.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.000
Yeah, Yuri with his Mazda 6
is five minutes away.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.400
Ah... 4.9 rating. Pretty good.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.520
But I'll cancel him,
because we're still...

13:01.600 --> 13:02.920
Should I cancel?

13:04.480 --> 13:05.480
Not?

13:05.560 --> 13:07.200
[Angus sighs]

13:07.280 --> 13:08.440
Four minutes away.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.040
I'll cancel. 'Cause if we've gotta
still...

13:12.120 --> 13:14.600
Should I... You're not saying anything,
so I don't know.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.520
Oh, don't cancel.

13:19.160 --> 13:22.360
OK. That's...
That's us, then.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.320
[Harry] Jeremy, coffee. Your turn.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.520
Righto, yep, um... usual?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.160
Uh, yeah. Soy flat with two.
Don't forget the soy, yeah?

13:30.240 --> 13:31.760
-Soy.
-Four-shot latte.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.440
Hold on, I'll get you some money.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.080
[whispers] Four-shot latte.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.000
Petty cash it and get the receipt, yeah?

13:39.080 --> 13:40.200
OK. I'll do that.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.720
[rhythmic electronic music plays]

13:49.960 --> 13:51.000
What the fuck?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.680
Suze? Dan?

13:59.560 --> 14:02.000
He's gone. Retrenched.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.520
Helmarrick just came in
and did an engineering cleansing.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.680
You're kidding? Gav and Lucy?

14:10.800 --> 14:11.840
Same.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.600
Fucking hell. Am I gone too?

14:14.680 --> 14:16.880
You and I are safe for now.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.080
[sighs]

14:21.240 --> 14:23.320
Man, that's bad for them.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.760
Do you still have that petty cash?

14:28.840 --> 14:30.280
Coffees were about 25.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.040
[waitress] Latte?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.120
Thank you.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.720
Did you get that from the bench?

14:39.480 --> 14:41.640
In the... Just in there. Yeah.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.720
That's the staff area.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.000
Oh, sorry. Do you mind if I...

14:47.080 --> 14:49.560
There's a newsagency down the road.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.840
Yeah, can I just...
I just really want to get 16 down.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.800
-Can I just...
[Emma] Hey, Aud.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.760
Hey, can I get two takeaway flat whites
to go, please?

14:57.840 --> 15:01.320
-Sorry, that took longer than expected.
-That's alright. You can't stay?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.040
No, sorry. Bitch of a day.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.160
[sighs]

15:04.240 --> 15:06.120
Oh, that's alright.
I have got a busy afternoon.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.640
Oh, what are you up to?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.680
Just... some stuff.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.240
Well, she'll wake up,
so there'll be lots to...

15:14.200 --> 15:15.480
lots to keep me busy.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.800
Oh, yeah, definitely.

15:16.880 --> 15:17.920
How was your meeting?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.440
-Oh, it was weirdly positive.
-Yeah, it was good.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.000
We got served tea and biscuits.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.880
[Emma] I maintain she has a crush on you.
[Sally] Stop!

15:23.960 --> 15:26.000
[Emma] With the cushion.
[posh accent] "It's from Morocco".

15:26.080 --> 15:29.360
What... What biscuits did you...
did she serve you?

15:29.440 --> 15:30.440
Um...

15:31.200 --> 15:32.800
Uh, Monte Carlos.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.240
Yuck.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.400
'Credible'.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.600
-Hmm?
-Sixteen down's 'credible'.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.520
Oh. Yep. Yes, it is.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.800
Oh, the target's easy too.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.160
Well, don't... No, don't tell me. It's...

15:46.640 --> 15:47.960
'remindoes'.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.360
What does that mean?

15:50.440 --> 15:51.800
It's 'modernise'.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.400
Quick, Sudoku race
before the coffee comes.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.280
Well, this is the waitress's,
so we should probably not do that.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.360
[Audrey chuckles]

15:59.480 --> 16:00.640
Just leave it for her.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.240
[Emma] Thanks. That's just on the account.
Thanks.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.720
-OK.
-I'll call you later.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.680
-OK. Bye, guys. Bye.
-See ya.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.320
[gentle music plays]

16:15.640 --> 16:17.600
Oh, just leave that.
The cleaner's coming tomorrow.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.720
Exactly.

16:19.480 --> 16:23.120
One day you'll have to explain to me
the logic of cleaning for the cleaner.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.200
[Ester sighs]

16:25.240 --> 16:26.560
What's for dinner?

16:26.640 --> 16:28.240
What do you feel like?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.040
I make decisions all day.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.640
Uh, Indian.

16:31.720 --> 16:32.720
I'll get some takeaway.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.920
-Great.
-Yep.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.920
Oh, how did the job interview go?

16:38.600 --> 16:41.720
I've, um... I've actually decided
not to go back to work.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.040
Just for now.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.280
So, you threw it?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.320
What? No. No, of course not.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.360
'Cause Angus called me.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.840
And?

16:53.280 --> 16:56.560
Nobody buys corporate bonds anymore,
Ruben.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.600
-Did I say corporate bonds?
-Yeah.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.840
And for future reference,

16:59.920 --> 17:02.560
when they ask you where you see yourself
in the next five years,

17:02.640 --> 17:05.118
they're not talking about
the school fucking catchment area.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.319
Well, yeah, exactly.
See, this is my point.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.880
My entire perspective has shifted.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.560
Do you have any idea how hard
it's going to be to convince people

17:14.640 --> 17:17.960
that you are serious about your career
if you have another year of unemployment?

17:18.040 --> 17:20.160
It's not unemployment.
I am on paternity leave.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.200
-You need a job to have paternity leave.
-Yeah, but this is a job.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.960
It's just unpaid with heaps of overtime,

17:26.040 --> 17:28.840
and slightly undervalued,
if I'm being honest.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.040
Funny. So, what work do you actually do,

17:31.120 --> 17:33.120
apart from Facebook status updates
and nap?

17:33.760 --> 17:37.440
All the books say to nap when she naps,
and the rest of the day I am flat out.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.560
On your back?

17:38.640 --> 17:40.320
And the status updates,
they're for you, actually.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.000
-Oh!
-And Mum.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.360
Christ, this place is a disgrace.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.920
We have a baby, Ester.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.800
Yes, who as far as I can see
does not eat corn chips

17:50.880 --> 17:53.640
and do massive poos in the toilet.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.720
You can't even change the toilet roll,
which takes all of six seconds.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.920
Alright, alright, alright.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.600
I will try and make more
of an effort around the house.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.240
I'm just... I'm just trying to tell you

18:03.320 --> 18:05.640
that I want to keep looking after
our daughter.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.840
I don't want to miss out on stuff.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.880
But it's OK for me to miss out
on the important stuff?

18:12.080 --> 18:13.920
I was hoping to go down to four days.

18:14.840 --> 18:15.840
You still can.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.440
Ruben, you have to get a job.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.280
Come on, Ester.
This will be good for all of us.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.960
Don't they say professional women
need wives?

18:24.040 --> 18:25.520
Actually, that'd be quite good
at the moment,

18:25.600 --> 18:27.600
'cause at least she'd take the bins out.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.360
[indistinct chatter on laptop]

18:31.440 --> 18:33.000
Ba-nanna from heav...

18:33.080 --> 18:34.440
Ba-nanna from heaven?

18:34.520 --> 18:36.800
Like 'manner', like... 'nanna'.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.400
Like 'banana' with an American accent.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.400
Kind of. It's a bit of a long bow.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.440
What are you doing?
Is that a TED Talk?

18:46.080 --> 18:49.040
Yep. 'Distant Time
and the hint of a Multiverse'.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.960
-What's that about?
-I don't know.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.400
I've watched it three times now.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.040
Thought it would spark up the brain.
I'm becoming monosyllabic.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.360
You just used 'monosyllabic'
in a sentence. That's pretty good.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.440
Yep. I have no short-term memory.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.280
You know, today I had to
spell my name on the phone.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.760
-You know what I said for 'Y'?
-What?

19:05.840 --> 19:08.440
'Yuck'. That's all I had. 'Yuck'.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.120
Yeah, no, yuck's OK.

19:10.200 --> 19:15.040
I mean there's yellow, youth,
year, yacht, Yentl.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.240
OK. Showing off.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.720
Yahtzee.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.280
[Audrey groans]

19:19.360 --> 19:20.760
Oh, you sore?

19:20.840 --> 19:21.840
Mmm.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.280
-Do you want a massage?
-Oh, thank you.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.760
-Yep.
-Yep.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.680
[indistinct whispering]

19:29.040 --> 19:32.320
[relaxed sigh]

19:32.400 --> 19:34.320
You know, I saw Sally today.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
Who's Sally?

19:36.320 --> 19:39.200
My work replacement.
She's totally stealing my job.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.120
You know she's writing a speech
for the Lord Mayor?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.520
Wow. You tried to do that for years.
Sorry.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.880
How was your day?

19:45.960 --> 19:48.640
Oh, my day was...
It was fine.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.320
We, um...

19:51.400 --> 19:52.800
What... What are you doing?

19:54.120 --> 19:55.440
I will relax you.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.960
I don't need relaxing. I need stimulating.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.160
Well, this does both.
It relaxes and stimulates.

20:01.240 --> 20:05.240
I can't. I can't. Not now, just, um...
We'll have sex soon.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.080
I promise. Big sex.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.960
-OK. Fine.
-Just...

20:11.680 --> 20:13.760
What are you doing? Don't stop.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.440
You just told me to stop.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.960
No, stop the fondling.
Not the massage.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.360
But that was a foreplay massage.

20:22.440 --> 20:26.720
No. That was a massage massage.
My neck is killing me.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.440
Well, you should probably go see someone.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.360
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'll probably make it worse.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.160
[Ruben chuckles]

20:49.040 --> 20:50.120
[Ruben chuckles]

20:51.040 --> 20:52.320
You almost done?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.600
-Huh, what?
-Do you want to have sex?

20:56.120 --> 20:57.280
Oh, sure.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.680
Can you initiate for once?

21:05.720 --> 21:08.280
Oh. Well, I can't now.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.240
I don't know.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.200
Just... think about it, you know?

21:16.280 --> 21:17.840
[indistinct mumbling]

21:25.800 --> 21:27.640
-Sexy time.
-No. I don't want to.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.400
[birds chirping]

21:37.000 --> 21:38.040
[Ester sighs]

21:38.120 --> 21:41.120
[gentle music plays]

22:07.560 --> 22:10.320
Sorab's ready.
Also, Ruben's on his way in.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.120
He's out of milk
and needs you to feed Eva.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.720
Should I book the conference room?

22:13.800 --> 22:16.840
No, I don't need the conference room
to feed my own daughter.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.120
[Ester exhales loudly]

22:23.880 --> 22:24.880
Yep?

22:25.800 --> 22:28.560
I haven't had a raise in almost two years,

22:28.640 --> 22:30.920
and I just feel a little bit more money

22:31.000 --> 22:34.200
will represent my contribution,
value, to the company.

22:34.280 --> 22:37.240
-You do, do you?
-Yeah, I do.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.920
Plus, I've had another offer.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.680
Oh, right. Here we go.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.480
Yeah. It's a really exciting new start-up.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.200
Exciting. What, not like here?

22:48.280 --> 22:50.560
Ester, I really like working here,

22:50.640 --> 22:52.360
but, you know,
I've got a family to support.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.600
I'm sole provider.
It's not like you and Ruben.

22:54.680 --> 22:55.960
You know what? Just go.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.400
If you've got a better offer,
just pack up your things and just go.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.600
What about the conference? I don't want--

23:01.680 --> 23:03.920
Belle? Can you draft an all-staff email?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.840
Sorab is leaving us, today. Uh, Ester, I--

23:09.160 --> 23:10.360
Just go!

23:11.400 --> 23:12.480
Now!

23:15.640 --> 23:17.880
Fuck, fuck, fuck. [sighs]

23:19.360 --> 23:22.000
[gentle music plays]

23:25.840 --> 23:27.040
[text message tone]

23:28.080 --> 23:29.080
Oh. Ah.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.200
[groans]

23:42.680 --> 23:43.680
[text message tone]

23:49.240 --> 23:51.880
[Audrey] Hey, thank you both
for helping out at...

23:51.960 --> 23:53.080
-Not at all.
-...the last minute.

23:53.160 --> 23:57.640
Hi, Pete, this is classical music
and finance-y guy.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.400
Ruben and Martha, this is Pete,
our resident trivia genius.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.480
Hi.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.360
Can we get through tonight
without cheating, please?

24:03.440 --> 24:05.160
Yes, no looking at phones.
That is banned.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.760
-I need to win.
[baby cooing]

24:07.840 --> 24:10.000
How did your interview go?

24:10.080 --> 24:11.320
Oh, great. Yeah, yeah.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.400
It made me realise
I don't want to go back to work.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.880
Wow, really?
I 'm kind of missing the work.

24:17.960 --> 24:20.560
I think PR was more stimulating
than I gave it credit for.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.080
No, I say enjoy it while it lasts,
you know?

24:23.160 --> 24:25.280
You realise our new mum brains

24:25.360 --> 24:27.240
are just getting rid of shit
that they don't need

24:27.320 --> 24:28.960
so before they start expanding

24:29.040 --> 24:31.240
with all the new learning
and multitasking.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.840
I read it in a science-y thing.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.600
What? Expan... Did you...

24:36.680 --> 24:38.240
Did you just say
we're going to get smarter?

24:38.320 --> 24:39.960
-Thank Christ.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

24:40.040 --> 24:44.160
Yeah, because our brains aren't shrinking.
They're becoming more complex.

24:44.240 --> 24:47.080
Apparently it's akin to
the growth in adolescence.

24:47.960 --> 24:51.600
Oh, my god. Hopefully,
without the acne and the horniness.

24:51.680 --> 24:52.680
[chuckling]
[phone ringing]

24:52.760 --> 24:54.080
-Oh, is that me?
[Pete] No phones.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.680
We haven't started yet, have we?

24:57.600 --> 24:59.760
Well, just, um...
Sorry about that. I will just...

24:59.840 --> 25:01.000
Oh, I have to get this.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.080
No. You have to hang up.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.440
Hey, Ester.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.520
[Ester] <i> Hi.</i>

25:04.600 --> 25:07.400
<i>I've got to work late</i>
<i>and I won't get home for story time.</i>

25:07.480 --> 25:08.680
<i>Can you organise some takeaway?</i>

25:08.760 --> 25:10.200
Yeah, well, maybe I won't need to.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.040
If things go well,
I'll be coming home with steak.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.800
[Ester] <i> Perfect. I need the iron.</i>

25:13.880 --> 25:16.400
<i>Oh, and Ruben,</i>
<i>you can have your six months.</i>

25:17.240 --> 25:18.720
Twelve. [Ester] <i> Nine.</i>
-Done.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.560
Ester, you are not gonna regret this.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.800
-Hang up the phone.
-Both of us. I have to go.

25:24.880 --> 25:25.880
-I have to go.
-Hang up!

25:25.960 --> 25:29.040
What is the name of the
multiple dimensions, many worlds theory?

25:29.120 --> 25:32.160
Oh, my god! I just TED Talked this!
What are the chances?

25:32.240 --> 25:34.600
[all] Aw!
-It's the many wor...

25:34.680 --> 25:36.640
The multi... The many...
The multi...

25:37.640 --> 25:39.040
The many... The multi...

25:40.400 --> 25:41.400
Gone. Sorry.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.520
[all] Aw!

25:42.600 --> 25:43.680
My area's geography.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.760
Was.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.760
When does the brain expansion happen?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.160
[Ruben chuckles]

25:51.240 --> 25:53.640
Hey, would you be interested
in a temp job?

25:53.720 --> 25:56.200
Ester needs PR for a conference.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.760
Ooh, I could maybe do that.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.520
-Yeah?
-Just a few days?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.000
-Maybe from home or something?
-Yeah.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.120
Name the final battle
of the Roman Republic

26:05.200 --> 26:08.440
between Octavian and Mark Antony.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.160
That would be the Battle of Actium.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.360
[both] Yes.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.880
What is Charles Darwin's seminal work?

26:14.960 --> 26:16.880
<i>Origin of Species.</i> That's easy.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.360
[trivia guy] The basset horn
is part of which musical family?

26:20.440 --> 26:22.120
-It's woodwind.
[Pete] Brass.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.560
It's woodwind.

26:23.640 --> 26:24.880
Uh, I think it's brass.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.680
She's a classical musician.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.280
Oh, OK.

26:28.360 --> 26:33.240
Which philosopher wrote
"I think, therefore I am"?

26:34.440 --> 26:38.520
What's the oldest Ivy League college
in the US?

26:38.600 --> 26:40.760
I'd say it's on the east coast,
so it'd be Princeton.

26:40.840 --> 26:45.680
The hippopotamus is native
to how many continents?

26:45.760 --> 26:46.920
[Pete] One.
[Martha] No, two.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.760
[Audrey exhales loudly]
[Ruben] Nice.

26:49.840 --> 26:52.080
Alright, we have a tie

26:52.160 --> 26:57.360
between Furrowed High Brows
and Quiz In My Pants.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.560
-Boo!
-Disgusting name.

26:59.640 --> 27:02.080
[trivia guy] So there will be one more
question to decide the winner.

27:02.840 --> 27:08.880
What canal is also known
as the Parturient Canal?

27:08.960 --> 27:10.560
-Geography.
-OK.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.840
I feel like I know this.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.400
I've heard this. Where have I heard this?

27:13.480 --> 27:15.400
-Oh, my god. I know it. I've got it.
-No idea. Fuck. Fuck.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.880
-What?
-Oh, my god. I am back!

27:18.680 --> 27:19.720
What is it?

27:19.800 --> 27:21.200
Well, it's the birth canal.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.720
[excited whispers]
[Pete] Yes, yes, it is.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.120
[Audrey exhales loudly]

27:26.200 --> 27:27.440
[Ruben] Nice.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.640
Thank you.

27:28.720 --> 27:32.560
And the winner is
The Furrowed Highbrows.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.080
[cheering and applause]

27:34.160 --> 27:35.160
Meat tray!

27:36.120 --> 27:37.880
Goody. Meat tray.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.680
Well done. Well done. Well done.
Lovely to meet you. Well done.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.160
-That was awesome, man.
-That was fun.

27:44.280 --> 27:47.160
-Dun-da-da!
[all] Yay!

27:47.240 --> 27:50.520
-Winner, winner, vegan dinner. Mmm.
-There we go.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.640
Sorry, vegan dinner?

27:53.920 --> 27:55.200
So it's not a meat tray?

27:55.800 --> 27:56.920
A vegan meat tray.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.480
Do you eat meat?

27:59.560 --> 28:01.320
Yeah. Heaps of it.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.520
-Oh!
-OK.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.760
-That's meat.
-No.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.880
Well, I told Ester I was
bringing home some steak.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.240
Well, tofu steaks.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.160
Yeah. Tastes like rib eye. It's delicious.
