01:42.180 --> 01:45.600
I start the bidding
at six hundred. Six fifty?

01:45.680 --> 01:49.060
I have one thousand dollars
in the back. Thankyou.

02:09.669 --> 02:11.460
If you're here for the sports
memorabilia auction...

02:11.500 --> 02:14.500
it's next Wednesday.

02:15.050 --> 02:19.010
Oh, well, thank you,
but I'm just here...

02:19.050 --> 02:21.140
to look at
all the colorful pictures.

02:21.220 --> 02:22.800
Well, good for you.

02:22.890 --> 02:26.640
How about this one?
lsn't it exquisite?

02:26.680 --> 02:28.520
Oh, yes, very exquisite.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.980
Yes, it is--for a fake.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.980
A fake?

02:33.020 --> 02:35.110
Yeah. See, it says here,
Lot 702...

02:35.150 --> 02:37.030
Young Girl by Window...

02:37.070 --> 02:39.650
is seventeenth century
Phoenician school.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.070
- But it's not.
- It's not?

02:42.120 --> 02:45.950
See, the shading
on the burnt umber is all wrong.

02:45.990 --> 02:47.580
I'd date this back
at the time...

02:47.620 --> 02:50.460
they was usin' the White House
as a get down spot.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.130
You know, when everybody
was up in there like that.

02:53.210 --> 02:58.720
When certain staff members
were backin' it up.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.630
Sir, with all due respect...

03:00.680 --> 03:02.340
I think you'll find that
the staff here at W. Boyle--

03:02.390 --> 03:04.350
It's a fake, OK?

03:04.390 --> 03:06.510
- I have an eye.
- An eye?

03:06.560 --> 03:08.980
Yes. Just like them glasses
you got on.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.060
I know when got up today,
you put 'em on.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.400
You got in the mirror,
you thought you were stylin'.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.650
You came to work, you know,
get a couple of more sales.

03:17.690 --> 03:20.900
I know you thought they was,
what, $500 Boucherons?

03:20.950 --> 03:25.700
Nah, they knock-offs, darlin'.
Yeah, those are knock-offs.

03:25.950 --> 03:29.750
They're fake, just like
this piece of shit here.

03:30.080 --> 03:34.040
702, Young Girl by the Window.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.300
Sold to paddle number fourteen.

03:42.340 --> 03:46.640
Next up, Lot 702,
Young Girl by Window...

03:46.680 --> 03:49.810
has been pulled
from the auction.

03:49.850 --> 03:53.560
So we'll move on to Lot 703...

03:53.600 --> 03:56.190
The Hudson River Valley
lake scene.

03:56.270 --> 04:00.150
A fine example of
nineteenth century American art.

04:00.190 --> 04:01.440
You may find it of interest...

04:01.490 --> 04:04.410
that the artist responsible
for this beautiful painting...

04:04.450 --> 04:07.330
was a Boston native
who apprenticed right here...

04:07.370 --> 04:10.950
on our very own
Commonwealth Avenue.

04:11.290 --> 04:12.710
My colleagues and l
here at W. Boyle...

04:12.750 --> 04:15.500
Excuse me.

04:15.540 --> 04:17.880
Here, let me switch with you.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.839
Let me just try to slide by you.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.589
Pardon me.

04:21.630 --> 04:23.510
Please, will you watch it?

04:23.550 --> 04:26.470
All right, that's...

04:28.390 --> 04:31.100
Um, let me try this.

04:32.180 --> 04:34.810
- OK, OK. Slide over. Go.
- This is outrageous.

04:34.890 --> 04:36.810
Like that, see? Got it.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.650
Excuse me. All right.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.530
Deal a meal.

04:48.870 --> 04:51.290
You OK?

04:51.910 --> 04:54.910
Would you mind
just leaving me alone?

04:55.250 --> 04:56.500
Now, if I leave you alone...

04:56.540 --> 04:59.460
you sitting here
on the verge of tears...

04:59.500 --> 05:02.670
how you think
that's gonna make me feel?

05:03.760 --> 05:06.380
You wouldn't understand.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.850
That painting is yours.

05:08.890 --> 05:11.390
You don't want to sell it,
but you have to.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.770
Three fifty.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.940
Give or take a pound.

05:16.980 --> 05:19.900
Five hundred. Five hundred.
Do I have five fifty?

05:19.940 --> 05:24.150
Five fifty I have. Five fifty.
Do I have six hundred?

05:24.190 --> 05:26.820
My father
left me the painting...

05:26.860 --> 05:30.700
and I love it, but I need
the money to pay a hotel bill.

05:30.740 --> 05:32.120
One thousand five hundred.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.950
One thousand five hundred.
Thank you.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.540
- Two thousand.
- I have two thousand dollars.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.170
Two thousand five hundred
dollars.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.090
I have 2, 500. Do I have 3, 000?

05:41.130 --> 05:43.590
Two thousand five hundred
going once...

05:43.630 --> 05:45.170
twice--sold.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.680
Paddle number fourteen.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.220
Well, that's that.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.800
What's your name?

05:52.810 --> 05:54.100
Amber Belhaven.

05:54.140 --> 05:56.060
Oh, very pretty name.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.730
Kevin. Kevin Caffrey.

05:59.270 --> 06:00.690
Look...

06:00.730 --> 06:03.530
I couldn't buy that painting...

06:03.570 --> 06:06.900
but I can buy you
a cup of coffee.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.120
So after I graduated
university...

06:11.200 --> 06:14.370
I moved here from London
to take this great job...

06:14.450 --> 06:18.290
with a new natural history
website, neanderthal. com.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.420
- What?
- Yeah, I know, I know.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.630
You can figure out the rest.

06:22.670 --> 06:25.750
They went under, so here I am.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.970
So what are you gonna do now?

06:28.010 --> 06:29.930
Get a job.

06:29.970 --> 06:31.470
I'm sure there are
plenty of opportunities...

06:31.510 --> 06:33.760
for a girl with a degree
in anthropology.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.560
OK. Now, anthropology...

06:35.600 --> 06:38.180
that's, like,
the study of man's...

06:38.230 --> 06:40.480
See, I'm glad I read that
in the dictionary...

06:40.520 --> 06:42.730
or I wouldn't know.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.770
So what do you do, Kevin?

06:46.150 --> 06:48.860
I'm a--I'm a businessman.

06:48.950 --> 06:52.870
Yeah. Matter of fact, I was late
for an appointment.

06:56.620 --> 07:01.540
I hope this is not too personal,
but in your hotel room...

07:01.580 --> 07:05.670
do they have one of those
little refrigerators?

07:05.750 --> 07:09.550
And in that refrigerator, do
they have those little bottles?

07:09.590 --> 07:11.300
Yeah, I guess.

07:11.340 --> 07:12.930
Well,
when my appointment ends...

07:12.970 --> 07:16.430
would you like me to come by
and check?

07:16.510 --> 07:18.480
See if in fact they do?

07:18.520 --> 07:22.020
Now, you wouldn't try
to sleep with me, would you?

07:27.190 --> 07:30.070
- Why are you blinking?
- Just a little nervous tic.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.990
I tell a lie, I blink.

07:32.030 --> 07:33.820
Oh, that must keep you
very honest.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.200
I'd make a terrible lawyer.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.990
So, can you force yourself
to blink--

07:38.040 --> 07:40.950
blink when
you're telling the truth?

07:41.370 --> 07:42.540
So when you're not blinking...

07:42.580 --> 07:44.250
it means you're definitely
telling the truth...

07:44.290 --> 07:47.710
but when you are blinking,
it means you're either lying...

07:47.750 --> 07:49.380
or it means that you're
forcing yourself to blink...

07:49.460 --> 07:51.050
to make it look like
you're lying.

07:51.130 --> 07:53.260
That's right.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.390
That sounds very complicated.

07:55.430 --> 07:58.100
It's not, really.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.850
So what's up?

08:00.890 --> 08:03.020
Can I see you later?

08:04.150 --> 08:05.770
Sure.

08:05.810 --> 08:09.530
Wait.
But you're blinking, too.

08:09.570 --> 08:11.740
You got the same thing
that I got...

08:11.780 --> 08:13.280
and I don't know what you...

08:13.320 --> 08:15.160
She's got it goin' on.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.490
I will find you.

08:44.770 --> 08:47.060
Who is it?

09:03.710 --> 09:06.120
This is for you.

09:16.430 --> 09:19.180
How much did he want
for that painting?

09:19.220 --> 09:23.060
'Cause I'll pay you back
as soon as I get a job.

09:23.220 --> 09:27.100
Well, it, uh...
it didn't cost me anything.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.650
What, you stole it?

09:28.690 --> 09:31.360
That's what I do.

09:33.150 --> 09:36.780
But I thought
you were a businessman.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.700
I am.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.830
I'm in the business of stealing.

09:41.870 --> 09:44.370
Yeah,
that's why I go to auctions--

09:44.450 --> 09:46.330
to learn what's worth stealing.

09:46.370 --> 09:51.340
Connoisseur
of all things portable.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.800
Wow.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.920
I apologize if it's a shock.

09:59.010 --> 10:00.640
Well, I dated a lawyer
for three years...

10:00.680 --> 10:05.020
so ethically speaking,
I've seen a stretch mark or two.

10:05.060 --> 10:10.150
Normally, I don't tell a woman
that on the first date.

10:10.190 --> 10:12.860
Then again, I don't normally
have these feelings.

10:12.900 --> 10:15.070
Me, neither.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.200
You see this ring?

10:27.370 --> 10:28.710
My father gave this to me...

10:28.750 --> 10:32.170
to remind me every day
how much he loved me.

10:34.750 --> 10:38.630
My father believed in fate,
and so do l.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.260
Used to be his lucky ring.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.600
Now it's yours.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.680
Well, how lucky was he?

10:46.730 --> 10:48.480
Well, he was wearing it...

10:48.520 --> 10:51.940
when he won that painting
in a card game.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.190
Now I want something from you.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.240
Name it.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.030
I want you to promise me
that you'll never lie to me.

11:01.070 --> 11:02.620
I've been
in that kind of relationship...

11:02.660 --> 11:04.240
and I'll never do it again.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.580
So no lies, OK?

11:06.620 --> 11:07.910
No lies.

11:07.950 --> 11:11.670
Said without a blink.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.130
Oh, my God,
it's like needles in my eye.

11:19.170 --> 11:21.550
I am too rich to have
a headache like this, Walter.

11:21.590 --> 11:24.220
- You gotta get me out of this!
- G-get you out of this?

11:24.300 --> 11:27.470
OK. I'll just undo
every single shady deal...

11:27.560 --> 11:29.600
you've been a part of
for the last five years.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.770
Sounds good to me!

11:30.850 --> 11:32.440
There are no loopholes
this time.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.110
Bankruptcy is the only option.

11:34.150 --> 11:36.150
Great! Screw it.
Screw everybody.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.780
Just file the goddamn papers.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.070
What's the worst
that could happen?

11:39.110 --> 11:40.740
Bankruptcy, Max.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.490
That's the worst
that could happen.

11:42.530 --> 11:45.740
Poodle cakes, it's only
the real estate company.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.910
This is no big deal.
Tell her, Walter.

11:47.950 --> 11:49.580
This is a...

11:49.620 --> 11:52.790
It's a tech-technical procedure.

11:52.830 --> 11:56.630
Yeah, that's right--a simple
little technical procedure.

11:56.670 --> 11:59.210
It's humiliating, and it'll be
in all of the newspapers.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.760
Well...

12:00.800 --> 12:02.930
Maybe my father was right
about my marrying you.

12:02.970 --> 12:05.050
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There is no need...

12:05.140 --> 12:07.470
to bring your daddy into this,
sugar lumps.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.600
Walter and l,
we have this all worked out.

12:09.640 --> 12:14.310
Our strategy is planned.
Right, Walter?

12:14.810 --> 12:17.360
Fix it, Max, or else.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.940
There is nothing to worry about,
snuggle bunny.

12:19.980 --> 12:21.110
These things have a tendency...

12:21.150 --> 12:22.450
to work themselves out
in the end.

12:22.490 --> 12:25.700
They always do. Come on.
Come on, give me little kisses.

12:25.740 --> 12:28.870
Come on, let me see 'em.
Let me see the lippies.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.950
That's it. Wanna go to lunch?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.290
Let's go. Come on.

12:32.370 --> 12:33.960
Let's go.
We'll eat. We'll drink.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.210
We'll forget all this crap.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.170
Respect.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.970
R- e-s-p--you know the rest.

12:46.010 --> 12:49.010
That's what's missing.
Nobody respect anything now.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.100
Nobody respect your work,
nobody respect your elders.

12:52.140 --> 12:53.810
You know what I'm sayin'?

12:53.850 --> 12:55.310
Nod your head, man,
if you're awake.

12:55.350 --> 12:56.900
Yeah, respect. I hear you.

12:56.940 --> 13:00.230
If I want to talk to myself,
I'll leave myself a voice mail.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.990
I know that good-lookin'
young man right there, baby.

13:04.070 --> 13:05.320
I know that smile anywhere.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.320
What you got
for good old Uncle Jack?

13:07.370 --> 13:09.200
Uh, nothin'.
I just came by to see Amber.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.330
- Where is she?
- She's workin'.

13:11.370 --> 13:12.660
She loves to work.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.000
She the best damn waitress
I ever hired.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.330
All perky and shit.

13:16.370 --> 13:18.420
You'd like her,
you get to know her.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.550
How I'm gonna get to know her,
speakin' that foreign language?

13:20.590 --> 13:22.380
I know all I need to know.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.880
You ain't pulled a damn job
since she moved in with you.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.890
Look, Uncle Jack,
I can talk to you.

13:27.930 --> 13:30.930
- You sure can.
- I can talk to you, right?

13:30.970 --> 13:32.430
That's doggone right.

13:32.470 --> 13:36.020
- All right, I think--
- What?

13:36.060 --> 13:37.400
- I know--
- OK.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.020
- I love her.
- No, no.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.610
Son, son, she wrong for you.
She too decent.

13:41.690 --> 13:42.780
What?

13:42.860 --> 13:45.700
Whatever happened to Sharon,
that nice con girl from Chicago?

13:45.740 --> 13:47.610
- Two years upstate.
- For what?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.120
- For conning people.
- No.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.200
Yeah. But, see, with Sharon,
it was just sex.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.620
- That's good.
- But with Amber...

13:55.750 --> 13:59.210
- Well, it's still sex.
- That's good.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.000
- But we talk.
- Talk?

14:01.040 --> 14:05.720
Yes. It's so amazing to wake up
with someone and just talk.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.050
Talk? You ain't Oprah.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.220
Hey, honey bun, how are you?

14:11.260 --> 14:15.810
- Mmm. How ya doin'?
- All perky and shit.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.770
Hey, look what the cat drug in.

14:18.810 --> 14:20.270
Hey, something cold
and Bavarian, barkeep.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.980
- You got it, buddy.
- Berger.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.440
- Hey, what's up, Kevin dog?
- What's up?

14:25.490 --> 14:28.070
Everything's sweet now.

14:28.110 --> 14:31.570
Hey, to all the women I loved
and who loved me back. Salud.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.990
You better not let Anne Marie
hear you talkin' that shit.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.370
Aw, don't worry, man.
She'll nev--

14:36.410 --> 14:39.540
It's Anne Marie.
What, does she have radar?

14:40.380 --> 14:44.090
Berger, best thing
that ever happened to me.

14:44.130 --> 14:47.130
Sweetheart.
Pleasure to meet you, Berger.

14:47.170 --> 14:51.640
And any friend of Kevin's
probably works nights.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.600
I gotta get back to work myself.
See you later.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.180
- It's a delight and a pleasure.
- Sooner than later.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.690
Nice ass.

14:59.730 --> 15:02.110
Hey, man, what did I just say?

15:02.150 --> 15:04.020
I'm sorry, dog.
I didn't know you meant it.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.280
Come on, most of the girls
you go out with are, you know...

15:06.320 --> 15:07.820
Yeah, well,
this one's different.

15:07.860 --> 15:09.490
She got a degree
in anthropology.

15:09.530 --> 15:12.160
I'll remember that if I ever
need to phone a friend, OK?

15:12.200 --> 15:14.450
- Do that.
- Hey, Kevin, I got one.

15:14.490 --> 15:16.950
- What?
- Tonight.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.960
Big score. Safe as houses.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Safe as houses?
A paradox, as they say.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.500
Yes. In fact,
it is a house of which I speak.

15:24.540 --> 15:26.960
- Well, talk to me.
- You ever read the papers?

15:27.010 --> 15:30.720
I used to,
but the news kept changin'.

15:30.760 --> 15:34.760
- Ever hear of Max Fairbanks?
- The big tycoon?

15:39.520 --> 15:40.980
Hey, this better be good.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.730
Oh, you're gonna love this, man.
Check it out.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.150
Come on.
I want you to read that.

15:44.190 --> 15:47.650
"Billionaire Max Fairbanks
today put Trigram real estate...

15:47.690 --> 15:50.610
"a division of T. U. l.,
into Chapter 11. "

15:50.700 --> 15:52.030
The man's broke,
and we gonna rob him?

15:52.110 --> 15:53.620
Oh, don't cry for him,
Argentina.

15:53.700 --> 15:56.030
This man would steal your moms
if he wanted corn bread.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.950
This is one of those
legal heists.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.660
Big business--that's where
they really teach you to steal.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.670
No heavy lifting.
Do it while you're on vacation.

16:03.710 --> 16:05.710
And brothers like us
don't even have a dental plan.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.250
Come on, read on.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.170
"Under the terms
of the Chapter 11 agreement...

16:09.210 --> 16:11.840
"Fairbanks no longer has access
to various properties...

16:11.880 --> 16:13.340
"including West Chop...

16:13.390 --> 16:17.220
"his Marblehead
beach- front residence. "

16:17.260 --> 16:21.180
The man can't even
get in his own house?

16:26.860 --> 16:30.110
- Always makes me laugh.
- The old upstairs hall light.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.190
Why don't they just
hang out a sign...

16:31.240 --> 16:34.530
"Welcome, burglars.
No one home. "

16:35.070 --> 16:37.780
- Here.
- Damn, these are nice.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.950
Aren't they, man?

16:38.990 --> 16:40.700
I know a lot of guys who
switched to rubber surgicals...

16:40.750 --> 16:44.670
but for comfort and feel,
you can't beat the lsotoner.

16:44.710 --> 16:46.670
First class, my man.

16:46.710 --> 16:47.880
First class all the way.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.380
Coming from you,
that means a lot. Serious.

16:50.420 --> 16:53.420
It's all good. Let's do this.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.470
Oh, come on, Max.
You never let me do it.

16:58.510 --> 17:00.680
I'm not done. I have more.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.560
God, I can't believe you.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.940
Max, will you please
listen to me?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.859
I love the costume.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.280
I'm naked.

17:13.609 --> 17:15.319
Oh, a joke.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.819
Yeah, a joke.

17:24.079 --> 17:28.380
Ah, baby. I did it. I did it.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.090
What do you say?
What do you say?

17:31.130 --> 17:34.260
Can we please get back to what
we were talking about before?

17:34.300 --> 17:36.220
Oh, that. Look...

17:36.260 --> 17:37.760
I think you'd make
a wonderful...

17:37.800 --> 17:39.260
entertainment journalist,
Kimberly.

17:39.300 --> 17:43.310
Tracey. Tracey Kimberly.

17:45.270 --> 17:46.940
I'm just not sure
I want to talk about it...

17:46.980 --> 17:49.610
at this precise moment.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.520
You know, I knew you'd say that
once we did it--

17:51.570 --> 17:53.440
Don't say
what you're about to say.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.450
Don't turn
a perfectly fun evening...

17:55.490 --> 18:00.280
into something cheap and sordid
by talking business.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.660
Here comes the little finger man
coming to get you, hmm?

18:03.700 --> 18:07.120
Wow, check that out.
Ooh, look at that.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.630
- Faberge.
- Oh, baby.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.500
Gold enamel, diamond inlay.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.050
Oh, yeah, I have it now.

18:14.090 --> 18:16.260
Yeah, baby.
And I got the score, baby.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.880
Is that not the score
or what, huh?

18:17.930 --> 18:22.550
Fun, too.
Like an Easter egg hunt.

18:22.970 --> 18:24.640
You want to hop upstairs,
and I'll just work this floor?

18:24.680 --> 18:27.440
You called it. You called it.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.230
Thanks.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.940
All right. You wanna do it?
Let's do it. Here we go.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.230
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.490
Go. Ready? We're gonna do it.

18:35.530 --> 18:40.990
Five, four, three, two...

18:41.120 --> 18:44.410
Titanic heartthrob
Leonardo DiCaprio...

18:44.450 --> 18:48.500
told me, Tracey Kimberly, in
an exclusive E. T. interview...

18:48.540 --> 18:50.500
that he is currently
in negotiations...

18:50.540 --> 18:52.630
to do a sequel
to the summer blockbuster...

18:52.670 --> 18:56.630
which will be entitled
Titanic 2.

18:56.670 --> 18:57.840
What is it...

18:57.880 --> 18:59.800
the story of a dead guy
on the bottom of the ocean?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.300
Who?

19:01.340 --> 19:04.100
Well, lookie here.

19:04.140 --> 19:06.180
Monday...

19:06.270 --> 19:08.020
Tuesday, Wednesday...

19:08.100 --> 19:10.640
Every day of the week.

19:11.860 --> 19:15.150
- What?
- Shh. Quiet. I hear somebody.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.870
Oh, yeah. Now we're stylin'.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.790
Berger, a tan suede newbuck.

19:31.830 --> 19:34.210
Yeah, I like a thick sole
with a tailored suit.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.300
Grounds it,
know what I'm sayin'?

19:36.340 --> 19:38.960
I do.

19:39.300 --> 19:42.550
- Oh, gosh.
- That's why I bought them.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.890
Tracey,
come on, get out of here.

19:48.930 --> 19:50.890
What do you think this is,
a photo shoot?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.230
But I want to see
what's going on.

19:52.270 --> 19:54.060
What does it look like
is going on?

19:54.110 --> 19:57.070
The guy's robbing the house.
I got a gun on him.

19:57.110 --> 19:59.990
Go on back in there.
Put your clothes on.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.570
Damn. You must be rich.

20:02.610 --> 20:04.370
That's right.
Eat your heart out.

20:04.410 --> 20:07.910
Look, you caught me,
fair and square.

20:07.950 --> 20:10.210
But how about
I walk out of here...

20:10.250 --> 20:12.830
nothing taken, nothing harmed?
How does that sound?

20:12.920 --> 20:15.630
You stay right where you are,
or I shoot you in the head.

20:15.710 --> 20:19.210
- How's that sound?
- Violent.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.260
But I see your point.

20:23.970 --> 20:26.600
- So, he wasn't carrying a gun?
- No, sir.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.850
- No l. D.?
- Nothin'.

20:28.890 --> 20:33.100
- What's your name, bro?
- Petey Wonder.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.480
I'm Stevie's little brother...

20:38.070 --> 20:39.360
but I don't sing.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.690
You know who I am?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.700
You got a lot of balls, huh?

20:42.740 --> 20:46.620
You come into my house,
into my bedroom...

20:46.660 --> 20:48.700
and take my ring.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.450
- What?
- That's my ring.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.790
Stop trippin', all right?
This is my ring.

20:52.830 --> 20:55.460
Ha! Son of a bitch! He was gonna
waltz out of here...

20:55.500 --> 20:56.840
with my ring
on his little finger.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.960
Take off the ring,
give it to Mr. Fairbanks.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.710
- Officer, this is my ring.
- Sure. Give him the ring.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.720
Look, my girlfriend
gave me the ring.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.260
If I don't come home
with my ring--

21:04.300 --> 21:06.930
Give me the ring. Give me it.

21:06.970 --> 21:09.350
This is my ring.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.100
You expect us to believe that?

21:12.140 --> 21:15.230
You...

21:18.820 --> 21:20.780
I can go along
with some things, but...

21:20.820 --> 21:24.110
some things make no damn sense.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.910
- Let go of the damn ring.
- This ain't right.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.990
Write a letter to the editor.

21:30.040 --> 21:34.160
Oop. I forgot.
I own the newspapers.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.670
We'll take care of everything.

21:36.710 --> 21:38.460
Get him out of here.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.840
Don't you worry,
Mr. Fairbanks.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.340
This is a good ring.

21:42.380 --> 21:46.010
This is a very nice ring.

21:48.180 --> 21:51.140
All right, just hear me out, OK?
One more time.

21:51.220 --> 21:53.810
I just feel if we were
to go back, you know...

21:53.890 --> 21:56.940
and, uh, give him
a chance to confess...

21:57.020 --> 21:58.360
you know, come clean...

21:58.400 --> 22:03.530
he might just hand over what is
in fact my rightful property.

22:03.570 --> 22:06.070
I could see how that sounds
all messed up, right?

22:06.110 --> 22:07.320
Comin' out of my mouth.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.200
But it's the truth.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.370
Can I see my lawyer?

22:11.410 --> 22:13.700
Seventeen,
with the robbery suspect...

22:13.750 --> 22:15.790
at Twenty-five Harbor Heights,
Marblehead...

22:15.830 --> 22:18.330
what's your twenty?

22:18.380 --> 22:20.840
Yeah. That's it, 10-4. We're on
the corner of Camden and 4th...

22:20.920 --> 22:23.920
en route to the station
with the perp in custody.

22:24.090 --> 22:28.340
What? Hey! Hey, you! Stop!

22:29.430 --> 22:31.300
Shit! What's going on?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.890
That son of a bitch!

22:57.660 --> 22:59.250
Anything?

22:59.330 --> 23:01.790
Nothing. Clear. Let's go.

23:23.310 --> 23:26.690
I want my damn ring!

23:29.150 --> 23:31.910
You don't know what you started.

23:55.680 --> 23:59.180
I'll take door number three.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.900
Gotta go!

24:19.040 --> 24:22.000
Hello, honey bun.
How was your day?

24:22.040 --> 24:24.960
Good.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.970
What's the matter?

24:36.300 --> 24:38.470
Well, was it bad?

24:42.600 --> 24:44.770
Go on.

24:46.770 --> 24:49.400
I lost the ring.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.320
Oh, Kevin,
I just gave you the ring.

24:55.410 --> 24:59.040
Well, actually, it's worse
than that. The ring was stolen.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.040
Stolen by who?

25:01.080 --> 25:04.960
Of all the lousy, jerkological,
cheap- shot stickups...

25:05.000 --> 25:06.130
this has gotta take the cake.

25:06.170 --> 25:09.210
- You got that right.
- Robbed by a householder...

25:09.250 --> 25:11.300
doing a robbery.

25:11.340 --> 25:14.800
Terrible, Kevin, terrible.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.930
- You laughing at me?
- Hell, yeah, I'm laughing.

25:16.970 --> 25:20.020
It's embarrassing. You should be
ashamed of yourself.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.310
Sixteen thousand.

25:21.350 --> 25:23.100
What's in that cigar
you're smoking, huh?

25:23.140 --> 25:25.900
Come on, the Fabergé egg alone--

25:25.940 --> 25:27.230
Nice. Don't want it.
It's hard to move.

25:27.270 --> 25:30.150
- Can't move it.
- The damn car, OK?

25:30.190 --> 25:31.280
It's worth--

25:31.360 --> 25:34.400
OK, I'll give you six and a half
for the car.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.570
Round it off to twenty-one five.

25:36.610 --> 25:38.490
That's because
I raised you as my own...

25:38.530 --> 25:41.580
and I'm happy to see you
back in the business.

25:41.620 --> 25:43.370
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen.

25:43.410 --> 25:47.080
- Plus six and a half.
- Half, right.

25:47.130 --> 25:51.170
- ls twenty-one five?
- Man, look. Six...

25:51.460 --> 25:54.470
Twenty- one, fifteen, twenty...

25:54.590 --> 25:57.050
Don't worry about it.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.350
Look here, it's late, all right?

25:59.430 --> 26:01.310
I wanted to see
if you're on your game...

26:01.350 --> 26:03.770
so I took a shot at you.
That's all I did.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.600
Man...

26:05.640 --> 26:09.150
I just feel like I'm getting
robbed by everybody tonight.

26:11.650 --> 26:13.780
Come on, Kevin,
it's not that bad.

26:13.820 --> 26:16.360
Why are you so upset?

26:16.400 --> 26:19.200
Why am I so upset?

26:19.410 --> 26:21.530
Baby, let me show you something.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.700
You see this?

26:23.750 --> 26:27.920
This is a Fabergé egg--
Russian, 1890.

26:27.960 --> 26:31.840
Now, some people get all freaked
and obsessed by these.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.920
Why?
It's what it represents.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.430
Power, taste, superiority.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.720
That's all in the mind...

26:38.760 --> 26:41.350
of the person
who puts a price on it.

26:41.390 --> 26:43.810
What's it mean to me?

26:43.850 --> 26:45.430
Not a damn thing.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.940
Too hard to fence.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.940
Now, the ring,
on the other hand...

26:50.980 --> 26:52.570
is priceless.

26:52.610 --> 26:56.440
It symbolizes
the day my life changed--

26:56.490 --> 26:58.150
the day I met you.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.860
Wow.

27:08.330 --> 27:10.750
Let's go, Monty.
Let's see what you got.

27:13.670 --> 27:15.840
Ooh, bull's-eye!

27:15.880 --> 27:18.510
Game, set, match.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.140
Do we have a problem?

27:24.180 --> 27:26.020
No. You have a problem...

27:26.060 --> 27:28.350
from which l,
your long suffering attorney...

27:28.390 --> 27:31.230
will once again
try to extricate you.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.610
- So?
- So...

27:33.650 --> 27:35.110
there was a break-in last night.

27:35.150 --> 27:38.150
Oh, no. You're kidding.
Really?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.410
Hmm. Did they get much?

27:40.490 --> 27:43.700
A hundred fifty thousand dollars
in valuables, plus a car.

27:43.740 --> 27:47.750
That's right, Max. He went back.

27:48.540 --> 27:51.370
- Son of a bitch.
- Sir!

27:51.420 --> 27:53.960
Shut up.

27:54.340 --> 27:58.010
Does Lutetia
know about the, uh...

27:58.050 --> 28:00.130
About the young lady?
So far not.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.390
You've got bigger problems, Max.

28:02.430 --> 28:04.680
The bankruptcy judge
is furious...

28:04.720 --> 28:06.390
you disobeyed his order
not to use the house.

28:06.430 --> 28:11.270
Can't you use a seedy motel,
like a normal philanderer?

28:14.520 --> 28:15.980
What's so funny?

28:16.020 --> 28:17.400
I was thinking
about the robbery.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.900
Something funny
about the robbery?

28:18.940 --> 28:22.450
Yeah, yeah, Walter, there is.

28:22.610 --> 28:24.530
You think that shit's funny?

28:24.570 --> 28:27.620
He boosted your ring
right in front of the cops?

28:28.910 --> 28:30.580
Come on, you got to see
the humor in it, please.

28:30.620 --> 28:32.370
I don't.
I don't see the humor.

28:32.420 --> 28:35.710
I robbed a thief. How could you
not see the humor in that?

28:35.750 --> 28:37.170
Because it's not funny.

28:37.210 --> 28:39.960
It's more than just funny,
Walter. It's fate.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.720
Here.
Take a look at this symbol.

28:42.760 --> 28:46.430
It's my company logo
from the I Ching.

28:47.390 --> 28:50.350
Omens, signs, throwing bones...

28:50.390 --> 28:53.650
I don't throw bones, Walter,
but I do throw coins.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.020
And I've been using the I Ching
for twenty years...

28:56.060 --> 28:57.900
and look where it's got me.

28:57.940 --> 28:59.610
This ring...

28:59.650 --> 29:02.110
is a sign.

29:02.150 --> 29:05.240
Everything
is gonna be just fine...

29:05.280 --> 29:09.950
as long as I hold on
to this lucky ring.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.000
Don't worry.
We'll get your ring back.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.330
- Fairbanks is big game.
- Right.

29:14.370 --> 29:16.790
We need a big game hunter.

29:17.630 --> 29:20.000
Shelly Nix.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.890
Shut the fuck up, man.

29:26.970 --> 29:28.100
Thank you.

29:28.140 --> 29:29.260
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

29:29.310 --> 29:31.730
Can you find this asshole
or not?

29:31.770 --> 29:32.930
Piece of cake.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.810
It's no harder than shutting
down A. O. L. for an hour.

29:34.850 --> 29:36.690
Not that I'd have any interest.

29:36.730 --> 29:38.820
All right. Check it out, y'all.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.530
Usually, when you're trying
to track somebody down...

29:40.570 --> 29:42.860
what you want to do is start
with airline computers...

29:42.900 --> 29:46.200
car rental companies, big hotel
chains, stuff like that.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.530
This guy's a high roller.
He's got his own personal jet...

29:48.580 --> 29:51.160
so it's nothing
but private limos...

29:51.200 --> 29:53.370
and corporate hotel suites
from there on out.

29:53.460 --> 29:54.750
How do you find him?

29:54.830 --> 29:57.380
He's got a personal assistant
right here in Boston.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.960
She e-mails his itineraries,
his schedules.

30:00.050 --> 30:02.510
She practically knows
every detail of this guy's life.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.050
Her name is Gloria.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.890
The ring I told you about--

30:10.930 --> 30:13.980
I'm more convinced than ever
it's major mojo.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.480
You know...

30:15.560 --> 30:17.810
I wouldn't tell
anybody else this but you.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.440
What, my musky teddy bear?

30:19.480 --> 30:22.480
Tell mama.
You can tell mama bear anything.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.990
Mama bear don't care.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.990
Gloria, stop it.
We've discussed this already.

30:26.070 --> 30:28.530
Screw you, Max.
Promises were made.

30:28.570 --> 30:30.030
- Gloria.
- Never mind.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.530
The past is the past.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.450
What can I do for you, sir?

30:33.500 --> 30:37.290
I was saying I was beginning
to go into one of my dips.

30:37.330 --> 30:40.880
I was feeling
fear and anxiety and--

30:40.920 --> 30:45.050
But this ring is like a sign
everything's turning around.

30:45.090 --> 30:47.550
I was just wondering if,
you know, you could confirm--

30:47.590 --> 30:50.890
All right, Max. All right.

30:51.430 --> 30:55.140
Nine in the second place.
Tread a level course.

30:55.180 --> 30:59.690
The perseverance of a dark man
brings good fortune.

30:59.770 --> 31:02.480
Judgment, treading upon
the tale of the tiger...

31:02.570 --> 31:04.030
it does not bite man.

31:04.110 --> 31:06.070
What did the Boston Herald
just call me?

31:06.110 --> 31:07.490
"The dark prince of plunder. "

31:07.530 --> 31:09.740
Perseverance of the dark man--
that's me.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.370
Well, maybe.

31:11.410 --> 31:12.830
Treading on the tiger's tale.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.660
Taking mad chances
and getting away with it.

31:14.700 --> 31:18.330
Like that time we were
in the elevator at T. U. l.?

31:19.620 --> 31:22.210
Focus, Gloria, focus.

31:22.250 --> 31:24.090
Let me consult my cards.

31:24.130 --> 31:25.300
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

31:25.340 --> 31:28.420
I will, Max.
It takes a little time.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.350
What? What? Gloria, what?

31:34.430 --> 31:36.640
- Max, I'm losing you.
- Gloria, what?

31:36.730 --> 31:37.810
You're cutting out.
I can't hear you.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.690
I hope you got the e-mail that
Lutetia wants you to call her.

31:39.730 --> 31:40.810
Lutetia? What does she want?

31:40.850 --> 31:42.190
Lutetia? What does she want?

31:42.230 --> 31:44.320
The only person he's afraid of
is his wife Lutetia.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.690
Here she is--
Design Times, June '98.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.740
Beacon Hill townhouse
of Max and Lutetia Fairbanks.

31:49.820 --> 31:53.450
Damn. Lutetia
looks more like Morticia.

31:53.490 --> 31:55.410
What the hell were you doing
at the beach house...

31:55.450 --> 31:58.160
and who the hell
were you doing it with?

31:58.200 --> 32:00.920
Scandal and disease, Max.
These are the deal-breakers.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.080
I'm a monk.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.590
Just because
you have the hairstyle...

32:03.670 --> 32:04.920
doesn't mean
you lead the lifestyle.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.960
And take off your shoes--
the white carpet.

32:08.010 --> 32:11.340
Oh. Tell me again.
Why did I marry you?

32:11.380 --> 32:13.050
Because I grew up
on Beacon Hill...

32:13.090 --> 32:15.600
which gave you entrée
to wealthy family friends...

32:15.640 --> 32:17.810
who could invest
in all your business ventures.

32:17.850 --> 32:19.230
And you had a great ass.

32:19.310 --> 32:21.230
Oh. Have a great ass.

32:21.270 --> 32:22.650
Don't forget.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.810
Picker is hosting
the botanical garden benefit...

32:24.900 --> 32:27.360
at the Sheraton Boston tonight
honoring me.

32:27.440 --> 32:30.450
I'd like to pay tribute
right now.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.700
Come over here.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.320
Six o'clock sharp.

32:33.370 --> 32:36.160
Picker hates it
when you're late.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.750
Right.
Picker first, pecker later.

32:42.540 --> 32:45.130
Boy, I need a massage.

32:45.670 --> 32:48.380
Ah, hold up, hold up.
E- mail from Gloria--

32:48.420 --> 32:51.800
benefit tonight at the Sheraton
Boston with his wife. Nice.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.930
Let the games begin.
Ha ha. Yeah, Kevin.

32:55.010 --> 32:56.390
Hell, yeah, baby.

32:56.430 --> 32:59.310
Very hip, very cool.

32:59.350 --> 33:01.850
Very Vegas in the sixties.

33:02.140 --> 33:04.770
But how about you come over here
and we mess it up a little bit?

33:04.810 --> 33:07.310
Let me entertain you first.

33:12.070 --> 33:13.860
Give me dollars,
give me dollars.

33:13.910 --> 33:15.990
Put 'em here.
Twenties go here...

33:16.030 --> 33:17.490
hundreds go here.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.080
During her eight years...

33:19.120 --> 33:21.790
of involvement
with the botanical garden...

33:21.830 --> 33:26.540
she has impressed us all with
her generosity and enthusiasm.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.260
Evening. Evening.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.470
Evening, sir.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.590
Lutetia Fairbanks.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.270
What's happening,
birdie, birdie?

33:46.310 --> 33:47.940
You a talking bird?

33:47.980 --> 33:51.030
Say, "Max, that's your ass. "
Ooh!

33:51.070 --> 33:53.900
Ooh, I'm sorry. Ladies!

33:53.950 --> 33:56.950
Where have y'all been?
Lookin' good.

33:56.990 --> 33:59.580
You know, I haven't seen y'all
since my polo accident.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.910
Who does your eyes?

34:00.990 --> 34:05.710
Yeah, yeah. Look at y'all.
Mucho eleganté.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.460
Thank you.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.880
And thank you all
for coming tonight...

34:08.920 --> 34:10.590
and for
your ongoing commitment...

34:10.630 --> 34:13.010
to the Boston
Botanical Foundation.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.679
We have all sorts
of exciting plans lined up...

34:15.719 --> 34:18.550
none of which would be possible
without your generosity...

34:18.600 --> 34:21.600
Let me ask you something.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.600
Is that Mrs. Fairbanks up there?

34:23.639 --> 34:25.520
Their tireless team
of volunteers...

34:25.560 --> 34:27.440
'Cause I'm confused.
I thought Mrs. Fairbanks...

34:27.480 --> 34:33.400
was a young brunette
with, like, big soapy titties.

34:33.489 --> 34:36.400
You're here to blackmail me?

34:36.449 --> 34:38.620
Be cool.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.409
I'm just here
to get back my ring, OK?

34:40.449 --> 34:42.409
That's my lucky ring,
and I want it back.

34:42.449 --> 34:46.080
No, it's not,
because now it's my lucky ring.

34:46.120 --> 34:49.790
Spoils of war.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.090
It means something to me.

34:52.130 --> 34:54.050
Well, it means something
to me, too...

34:54.090 --> 34:56.010
because I took it
off a little pissant...

34:56.050 --> 34:57.220
who broke into my house...

34:57.260 --> 35:00.260
while I was trying to nail
Miss September.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.680
That was Miss September?

35:01.720 --> 35:03.520
Yeah, it was Miss September.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.520
Oh, damn. I got that issue.

35:10.270 --> 35:12.560
So how rich are you?

35:16.610 --> 35:18.450
You know...

35:18.490 --> 35:20.450
it's guys like you
think you can just...

35:20.490 --> 35:22.830
take whatever you want,
don't you?

35:22.870 --> 35:25.950
- Guys like me?
- Yeah.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.960
Who's the thief here?

35:30.670 --> 35:32.040
I want my damn ring.

35:32.090 --> 35:35.050
Well, you can't have
your damn ring.

35:45.350 --> 35:47.470
You're gonna regret this.

35:53.610 --> 35:56.360
Excuse me.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.900
Total stranger.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.490
Trés bizarre.

36:01.570 --> 36:02.990
Are you gonna eat that?

36:03.030 --> 36:04.530
I'm telling you, man.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.490
When--when word gets out...

36:06.540 --> 36:09.120
everybody
is gonna be laughing at me.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.250
That's it.
His ass is going down.

36:11.290 --> 36:14.540
- Take him down, man.
- Millionaire, billionaire.

36:14.590 --> 36:15.920
It don't even matter.
He's out the game.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.090
When I see him, what's up?
Pow! Boom!

36:18.170 --> 36:19.970
But you know what?
That's just the start.

36:20.010 --> 36:22.260
Guess where else I'm going.
I'm gonna do the ghetto smack.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.720
- Oh, the ghetto smack.
- What's the ghetto smack?

36:24.760 --> 36:26.720
Well, you hit him with anything.

36:26.770 --> 36:28.350
Drum set, bam!

36:28.390 --> 36:30.850
Piano, pow!

36:30.890 --> 36:32.020
Stop it!

36:32.060 --> 36:33.770
Sorry to break up the party...

36:33.810 --> 36:37.780
but I thought you were trying
to get the ring back for me.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.530
Yeah, baby. That's right.

36:42.570 --> 36:45.120
Kevin, are you blinking?

36:45.530 --> 36:49.120
No. What it was, right--
I had something in my eye.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.790
See, probably right here.

36:50.870 --> 36:53.000
- See?
- I think I got it for you.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.920
Oh, yeah, it's gone.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.550
Do me a favor.
Keep out of trouble, will you?

36:57.590 --> 36:59.210
No doubt.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.930
Baby letting you know
when something in your eye.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.800
- What you got?
- Check it out.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.890
He and his wife are going
to some cocktail party...

37:06.970 --> 37:09.180
ending by 8:00,
home by about 8:30.

37:09.220 --> 37:11.100
Yeah, we'll be there
waiting for him.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.140
Take the ring right off
his finger in his own home.

37:13.190 --> 37:15.270
And before that?

37:15.310 --> 37:18.980
A complete removal
of all things portable.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.990
I'm sure we can work this out,
Judge Callahan...

37:22.030 --> 37:23.320
if you just look
in your file there.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.660
You have a sworn statement
from my client...

37:25.700 --> 37:28.450
stating that he only went back
to the house in question...

37:28.490 --> 37:31.040
to pick up
some very important stuff.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.210
Very important stuff.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.710
I have a good idea
what he picked up there.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.210
Oh, you do, do you?

37:36.250 --> 37:39.420
You don't think the rules apply
to you, do you, Mr. Fairbanks?

37:39.460 --> 37:41.340
What?
What's he talking about?

37:41.380 --> 37:44.510
All right, all right, all right,
that's enough.

37:44.550 --> 37:45.760
Since you defied my order...

37:45.800 --> 37:47.470
not to enter
the Marblehead beach house...

37:47.510 --> 37:48.810
I have a good mind to reopen...

37:48.850 --> 37:51.680
the entire Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceeding.

37:51.730 --> 37:54.100
You know, you weren't so cocky
when you came to me...

37:54.190 --> 37:56.810
with your hand out
asking me for money.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.360
What did you say, Mr. Fairbanks?

37:58.400 --> 38:01.280
You think I forgot how much
it cost me to get you elected...

38:01.320 --> 38:02.440
by spreading stories...

38:02.490 --> 38:05.990
about your opponent's
sexual preferences?

38:07.030 --> 38:09.030
Oh, get some money.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.540
I fork over, and what do you do?

38:10.580 --> 38:13.620
You sit there
like a big, fat blob!

38:13.660 --> 38:16.620
- Sell the house!
- Up yours, you fat pig!

38:16.670 --> 38:20.340
And all the contents
at public auction.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.130
Max, what did you get
so crazy for?

38:22.170 --> 38:24.760
I'll tell you. He forgot
who the hell he paid off.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.970
It was the other judge.
I told you.

38:27.050 --> 38:30.720
Tread a level course.
You don't listen to me anymore.

38:30.810 --> 38:32.640
So I forgot
we backed the other mutt.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.100
Boy, this guy holds a grudge.

38:34.140 --> 38:35.640
Max, you get one final visit...

38:35.730 --> 38:38.060
to gather and remove
any personal effects.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.480
- One final visit?
- Yep.

38:39.520 --> 38:42.360
Max, I could come along
if you need some help.

38:42.400 --> 38:46.150
Thanks just the same.
Dial Miss September.

38:56.370 --> 38:59.330
Everything's gonna be fine.
The car will be here any second.

38:59.380 --> 39:02.000
we'll go to Missy's party,
and we'll leave early.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.760
- Right.
- Don't be so down, Maxie.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.180
We still have
an awful lot of houses left.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.680
Move your ass, Berger.
Don't start dragging on me.

39:09.760 --> 39:13.140
- I got a bad feeling, Kevin.
- Come on.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.430
Something's not right, man,
I'm telling you.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.850
The only thing's not right
is you run out on me again, OK?

39:17.890 --> 39:20.110
- I'm talking violence.
- I'm not leaving you, baby.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.980
You can't get rid of me, man.
We're partners.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.780
We're like Shaq and Kobe.
We're like Pippen and Jordan.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.190
We're like
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.740
Ann Marie's been making me go
to theater lately.

39:28.780 --> 39:33.080
- OK, I'm on the alarm.
- All right, good.

39:35.080 --> 39:38.040
Alarm disabled.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.710
And we're in.

39:39.790 --> 39:41.250
Yeah, baby.

39:41.290 --> 39:42.330
Yeah, baby.

39:44.670 --> 39:46.590
This is right out
of a Hitchcock movie.

39:46.630 --> 39:47.800
I'm getting vertigo.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.590
What's on your mind, Max?
Tell me.

39:51.640 --> 39:52.760
Oh, it's that bum of a judge.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.020
He's allowing me
one last visit to Marblehead...

39:55.100 --> 39:57.520
to collect my belongings.

39:57.930 --> 40:00.600
I thought maybe after the party,
I'd drop you off home...

40:00.650 --> 40:05.690
and I'd go on out
for one last overnight.

40:06.820 --> 40:09.780
You know what?
You've been through a lot today.

40:09.820 --> 40:11.280
Let's forget about the party.

40:11.320 --> 40:14.620
You go get your things.

40:16.160 --> 40:19.160
Nobody knows me like you,
Lutetia.

40:22.210 --> 40:24.540
All right.

40:26.630 --> 40:29.300
OK, sounds good.

40:29.380 --> 40:32.640
I'll just throw a few things
in an overnight bag.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.640
- That's them, man.
- I'll come with you.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.510
What?

40:38.140 --> 40:39.310
In the elevator.

40:39.350 --> 40:40.730
What the hell
are they doing back?

40:40.770 --> 40:41.940
I don't know.

40:41.980 --> 40:44.560
And then on to the beach house.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.730
But--but, uh...

40:46.780 --> 40:49.360
You know, there's no sense in
both of us going to the beach.

40:49.400 --> 40:53.030
I insist.
That's the whole point...

40:53.700 --> 40:56.870
It's been discussed. I'm going.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.040
They're gone.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.790
You don't even like
the beach house.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.000
It's so suburban.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.880
You are in a fragile state.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.510
I can't bear to think of you
out there all alone.

41:11.550 --> 41:13.340
Come on.

41:13.390 --> 41:15.260
lt'll be fun.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.260
l--Give me a minute.

41:17.310 --> 41:20.640
- Where the hell did they go?
- I don't know.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.530
Dial Miss September.

41:35.450 --> 41:38.370
Dial Miss September!

41:39.200 --> 41:42.000
Tracey, forget about tonight.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.870
Let's go, Max!

41:43.920 --> 41:47.290
They're up there.
Come on, move it.

41:48.250 --> 41:49.670
Hold it.

41:49.710 --> 41:51.670
Sounds like there are voices
coming from the wall.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.970
- Yeah, I don't get it.
- Stop. I'm going.

41:55.470 --> 41:57.140
It's not too late
to change your mind.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.680
Stop it. I insist.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.230
Damn!

42:04.310 --> 42:05.940
Quick, the alarm.
We gotta hurry.

42:06.020 --> 42:09.730
Engage in three, two, one...

42:11.940 --> 42:13.450
Damn.

42:13.530 --> 42:15.660
Move one inch, and we're done.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.530
There are motion detectors
everywhere.

42:18.580 --> 42:20.660
Tell me about it, Berger.

42:20.700 --> 42:23.330
Help me.

42:24.330 --> 42:26.960
You sound like The Fly.

42:27.790 --> 42:29.040
I'm sorry.

42:29.090 --> 42:32.420
- I gotta call Windham.
- Hurry!

42:33.170 --> 42:34.470
Windham!

42:34.630 --> 42:36.680
Shut up! Just shut up!

42:36.720 --> 42:38.390
I'm telling you right now,
the brakes are shot!

42:38.470 --> 42:40.600
Shut up, will you?
You are making me nervous.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.810
You were born nervous, and
you're making me more nervous.

42:42.890 --> 42:45.640
- Could you please?
- That rabbit is brand-new!

42:45.690 --> 42:47.060
I can't be spending my time
running around getting--

42:47.100 --> 42:50.070
Will you quiet down? I'm trying
to break in to this place.

42:50.110 --> 42:52.940
How dare you drive that fast
when we got kids in the car.

42:52.980 --> 42:55.650
Don't yell. I was barely
going over the speed limit.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.240
Where the hell is he?

42:57.280 --> 43:00.080
I can't hold on much longer.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.280
I feel that way, too...

43:01.330 --> 43:03.410
'cause my legs are dead.

43:03.450 --> 43:05.580
I can't feel my ankles...

43:05.620 --> 43:08.540
my knees...

43:09.080 --> 43:12.380
Uh, my calf is swollen.

43:12.460 --> 43:14.130
Kevin, I know this is not
the time to tell you this...

43:14.170 --> 43:17.430
but I didn't have to pee
until right now.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.930
Let it go, man. I won't tell.

43:20.010 --> 43:21.890
That's what you said last time.

43:21.930 --> 43:24.600
Why is it every time Kevin calls
we gotta drop everything...

43:24.640 --> 43:26.730
but anytime I call,
you pretend you can't hear me?

43:26.770 --> 43:28.350
Maybe because I like Kevin.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.770
You take that back, or you'll
never saw me in half again.

43:30.810 --> 43:32.070
We want ice cream!

43:32.110 --> 43:34.070
You kids want to disappear?
I can make that happen!

43:34.110 --> 43:36.650
Do not upset your father,
you get it?

43:36.700 --> 43:39.570
I can never find
the right damn key.

43:40.280 --> 43:41.410
Say thank you.

43:41.450 --> 43:42.830
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43:42.870 --> 43:45.080
Yo, I need your help, man.
This bag is too damn heavy.

43:45.160 --> 43:46.330
I need your help, man.

43:46.370 --> 43:49.500
I'm trying to help myself.
I can't even move my neck.

43:49.580 --> 43:51.710
Oh, man,
this thing's unbelievable.

43:51.790 --> 43:54.670
- I got the numbers, honey.
- I got the lock.

43:54.710 --> 43:56.170
You're the wind
beneath my wings.

43:56.210 --> 43:57.800
Alarm disabled.

43:57.840 --> 44:00.180
Security disarmed.

44:03.300 --> 44:04.600
OK, she's fixed.

44:04.640 --> 44:09.100
I can't feel my ass.
Numby- numb.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.770
Yeah, can you believe it?
Me and Edwina together...

44:11.810 --> 44:13.020
ten years this September.

44:13.060 --> 44:14.190
Yeah, ten's a big number.

44:14.230 --> 44:15.730
We're gonna have
a big anniversary party.

44:15.780 --> 44:16.900
We hope you can make it.
There's gonna be--

44:16.940 --> 44:18.990
- Come on!
- Shut up!

44:19.070 --> 44:21.950
Sure. I should be walking again
by September.

44:21.990 --> 44:23.280
I can't believe
it lasted ten years.

44:23.320 --> 44:25.990
I couldn't even last
ten minutes with her.

44:32.580 --> 44:34.590
Damn, this is nice stuff.

44:34.630 --> 44:37.710
First quality, top drawer.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.090
I can do one of two things.

44:39.130 --> 44:41.630
I can give you
two hundred grand cash now...

44:41.680 --> 44:43.260
or, if you're willing
to trust me...

44:43.300 --> 44:44.970
I could pretty much guarantee
that I can fence...

44:45.010 --> 44:47.770
most of the valuable stuff
for a much larger figure...

44:47.810 --> 44:50.060
and square up
with you guys later.

44:50.100 --> 44:52.600
It's totally up to you.

44:54.270 --> 44:57.110
We'll take the cash.

45:07.990 --> 45:10.450
Still no luck.

45:11.210 --> 45:14.080
Total failure.

45:17.130 --> 45:20.420
About sixty Gs.

45:20.970 --> 45:25.010
Oh, I got something for you.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.230
I knew it was
your favorite color.

45:30.310 --> 45:33.440
It's beautiful.

45:37.070 --> 45:41.070
Oh, my God!

45:41.110 --> 45:42.950
Where is my painting?

45:42.990 --> 45:44.410
- Gone.
- I can't believe--

45:44.450 --> 45:46.910
Who would do something
like this?

45:46.990 --> 45:51.120
That sneak thief.
Don't look down.

45:54.580 --> 45:56.500
Oh, hey, get some water,
Gloria...

45:56.540 --> 46:00.210
and shut that damn dog up
before I do.

46:00.510 --> 46:03.010
Park it there, OK.

46:03.090 --> 46:04.630
All right. Oh, sweetheart.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.180
Oh, baby. Oh, sweetie.

46:07.220 --> 46:08.680
Here you are.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.520
Oh, thank you, Gloria.
Here you go.

46:10.560 --> 46:14.140
I need a cigar. Give me my--
Where are my goddamn cigars?

46:14.190 --> 46:17.230
Perhaps the thieves
also smoke cigars.

46:18.690 --> 46:21.190
It's become so common,
hasn't it?

46:21.230 --> 46:23.360
Who the hell are you?

46:23.400 --> 46:26.160
Detective Alex Tardio...

46:26.200 --> 46:29.200
nineteenth precinct--robbery.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.410
Alex.

46:31.540 --> 46:33.790
That's a...

46:34.620 --> 46:37.830
Here, pumpkin, pumpkin.

46:46.380 --> 46:49.890
I love dogs. I have three
Bichon Frise myself.

46:49.930 --> 46:52.100
I love Bichon Frise.

46:52.140 --> 46:55.020
Lovely, fluffy little--

46:56.440 --> 46:57.520
Come on.

46:57.560 --> 47:00.360
So, how can I help you?

47:00.400 --> 47:02.480
Help me?
I'm here to help you.

47:02.530 --> 47:04.530
Why don't you take it upstairs,
boys?

47:04.570 --> 47:06.200
Hey, listen, uh...

47:06.240 --> 47:08.200
You and your wife
went away together...

47:08.240 --> 47:11.280
to your beach house
just for the one night?

47:11.370 --> 47:13.120
Yeah, that's right.
We're giving it up.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.540
Selling it. I suppose
we were saying good-bye.

47:15.580 --> 47:17.620
We're sentimental.
You know how it is.

47:17.670 --> 47:19.630
I'm a renter.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.460
Why are you selling the house?

47:21.500 --> 47:24.380
It's part of a court
settlement--technical procedure.

47:24.420 --> 47:27.800
- Bankruptcy?
- Technical procedure.

47:29.260 --> 47:30.930
So, let's see.

47:30.970 --> 47:32.760
When did you and your wife...

47:32.810 --> 47:36.730
decide to make this sentimental
journey out to your beach house?

47:36.770 --> 47:38.190
Last night.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.850
We were on our way
to a cocktail party.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.770
- Missy Davidson's party, right?
- Pretty thorough, huh?

47:42.820 --> 47:44.320
That's why I get the big bucks.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.650
Wasn't there something else
that happened...

47:45.690 --> 47:46.900
out at your beach house
recently?

47:46.950 --> 47:49.490
Something else?

47:49.950 --> 47:52.830
A robbery.
Wasn't there a robbery there?

47:52.870 --> 47:55.450
Yeah, yeah. That's--
Yeah, it was a robbery.

47:55.500 --> 47:58.370
l--Well, in all this,
I completely forgot.

47:58.420 --> 48:00.380
Weren't you there? In fact,
weren't you there with--

48:00.460 --> 48:02.460
That was perfectly innocent.

48:02.500 --> 48:05.750
You were there with the burglar,
and it was perfectly innocent?

48:06.380 --> 48:09.470
The burglar, yeah.
I was there with the burglar.

48:09.510 --> 48:10.890
Just me and the burglar.

48:10.930 --> 48:14.180
Scandal and disease, Max.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.270
OK, so,
I read the police report...

48:19.310 --> 48:21.100
and it's all very confusing.

48:21.150 --> 48:22.270
Confusing?

48:22.310 --> 48:23.900
Yes, and they're both
burglaries, aren't they?

48:23.980 --> 48:25.940
You think maybe
it was the same guy?

48:25.980 --> 48:28.700
- I didn't say that, you did.
- Then what are you saying?

48:28.740 --> 48:30.360
Oh, I see
all sorts of scenarios.

48:30.410 --> 48:32.320
That was a good place
for a picture.

48:32.370 --> 48:33.830
Like?

48:33.870 --> 48:35.490
Like there's a house
full of valuable objects...

48:35.540 --> 48:37.500
out at the beach that
you're not supposed to be in...

48:37.540 --> 48:39.460
but you are,
and a burglary occurs.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.500
And then you talk your wife
into leaving this house...

48:41.540 --> 48:43.840
for sentimental reasons...

48:43.880 --> 48:46.800
and when the coast is clear,
it happens again.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.840
Are you suggesting
that I hired a thief...

48:48.920 --> 48:50.340
to burglarize my house...

48:50.380 --> 48:51.720
so I could collect
the insurance money?

48:51.760 --> 48:53.510
I'm not suggesting anything.
You asked for scenarios.

48:53.550 --> 48:55.510
You're the one
that keeps saying things.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.480
Watch it, Mister Detective.

48:58.520 --> 49:01.020
You come into my house
and accuse me of things?

49:01.060 --> 49:03.100
You think I need
the insurance money?

49:03.190 --> 49:05.940
I could buy and sell
a thousand of you.

49:07.610 --> 49:11.490
Here, come on, baby.

49:11.700 --> 49:13.990
The Yorkie
is an independent dog...

49:14.030 --> 49:16.160
but a devoted companion.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.910
And despite his small size...

49:18.950 --> 49:23.210
he is more than willing to act
as a guardian for his master.

49:23.630 --> 49:26.380
Buy and sell a thousand of me?
Really?

49:26.420 --> 49:28.170
Just out of curiosity...

49:28.210 --> 49:29.710
how much would you get
for someone like me?

49:29.800 --> 49:32.510
You know, wholesale like that.

49:32.680 --> 49:35.350
I can't tell
if you're trying to trap me...

49:35.390 --> 49:37.850
or you're looking for a bribe.

49:44.020 --> 49:45.860
What the hell was that?

49:45.900 --> 49:49.150
All right, boys,
let's take a good look around.

49:50.490 --> 49:52.950
Dial Earl.

49:55.620 --> 49:58.200
lncoming!

50:06.250 --> 50:08.420
Earl Radburn,
head of security, T. U. l.

50:08.460 --> 50:10.260
It's Fairbanks.
We got a situation here.

50:10.300 --> 50:12.800
Yes, sir, Mr. Fairbanks.
I'll be there at 1400.

50:12.840 --> 50:14.050
Speak English, Earl.

50:14.090 --> 50:16.300
It's like 2:00, 2:30
at the latest.

50:16.340 --> 50:19.140
All right. Move your fat ass.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.890
What a fruitcake.

50:27.940 --> 50:30.940
$2, 500 for a skirt?
What, are you insane?

50:31.030 --> 50:33.650
That's daylight robbery.
It's like I always say, Kevin.

50:33.700 --> 50:36.490
Everybody's in on the game
in their own way. Am I right?

50:36.530 --> 50:38.490
- Sure, you're right.
- See? See? Listen to that.

50:38.530 --> 50:40.290
At least
we're up front about it, OK?

50:40.330 --> 50:41.950
These guys
invite you to Paris...

50:42.000 --> 50:44.500
turn out some 14-year-old models
who look like boys--

50:44.540 --> 50:45.790
I mean,
who am I to judge, right?

50:45.830 --> 50:47.290
Pretty soon you're light
a couple hundred Gs...

50:47.330 --> 50:49.840
flyin' back to Dallas
to your big-assed wife--

50:49.880 --> 50:51.340
Hey, you leave my ass
out of this one.

50:51.380 --> 50:53.340
I was talking about
a hypothetical ass.

50:53.380 --> 50:55.260
See why I married him?
Anybody?

50:55.300 --> 50:56.840
Yo, yo, yo.
I got information on your boy.

50:56.890 --> 50:59.300
Fairbanks has to be
in Washington on Wednesday.

50:59.390 --> 51:01.010
He's appearing before
some Senate subcommittee.

51:01.100 --> 51:03.350
Something about owning
too many television stations...

51:03.430 --> 51:04.520
in certain key markets.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.060
It's just a formality, because
from what I can gather...

51:07.150 --> 51:08.310
he's gonna grease up
the bums on the subcommittee...

51:08.360 --> 51:10.020
before he even gets there.

51:10.070 --> 51:12.690
See? It's just like I said.
Everybody's in on the game.

51:12.730 --> 51:15.610
Then we go to Washington.
Where's he staying?

51:15.650 --> 51:18.410
Homeboy keeps a crib
across from the Watergate.

51:18.450 --> 51:20.990
Hold on. I'm coming.

51:21.030 --> 51:23.160
Oh, no.
No, you're not coming.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.290
Ann Marie, we're going.

51:24.330 --> 51:26.290
We should go to Washington.
You're absolutely right.

51:26.330 --> 51:29.790
Please stay out of this.
Baby stay out of it. Thank you.

51:34.590 --> 51:38.220
You know what? Bottom line--

51:38.300 --> 51:40.890
you're not going.

51:42.100 --> 51:46.310
So nice you could get away
for a couple of days, boo.

51:46.350 --> 51:49.690
Very sweet of you
to insist, boo.

51:49.730 --> 51:52.150
Well, we're all here--
Fred, Ethel, Lucy, and Ricky--

51:52.190 --> 51:55.320
the Mertzes and Ricardos
go to Washington.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.360
Lucy, don' do that to me!

52:17.380 --> 52:22.010
Stress. That's the killer.

52:22.050 --> 52:25.060
You can't think straight.

52:25.100 --> 52:28.520
You get all tight and confused.

52:29.140 --> 52:31.310
Lower.

52:36.610 --> 52:38.610
That is as low
as I'm gonna go...

52:38.650 --> 52:42.120
until you make
a commitment, Max.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.240
You knew I was married...

52:43.320 --> 52:46.290
when we started
this relationship, Tracey.

52:46.370 --> 52:48.620
I meant a commitment
to getting me an audition...

52:48.660 --> 52:50.540
with Entertainment Tonight.

52:50.580 --> 52:52.710
Oh, that.

52:52.750 --> 52:56.550
Well, let me be perfectly clear
about that.

52:56.590 --> 52:59.050
You have no talent.

53:01.220 --> 53:02.680
What the hell
did you do that for?

53:02.760 --> 53:06.640
- You have no respect.
- Well, why should I respect you?

53:09.270 --> 53:13.230
Oh, my head's ringing. Oh, oh!
My whole head is ringing.

53:13.270 --> 53:15.570
Massaging you
is like kneading dough...

53:15.610 --> 53:18.230
and as for the sex,
let me be honest.

53:18.320 --> 53:21.740
It was like sleeping
with a damp sheep.

53:23.910 --> 53:25.330
Asshole.

53:25.370 --> 53:27.040
She's just upset
because I'm dumping her.

53:27.080 --> 53:29.410
Eleven more months
where she came from, sir.

53:29.450 --> 53:32.040
Right.
What I want to know, Earl...

53:32.080 --> 53:33.710
is what are you doing
about this schmeggege...

53:33.750 --> 53:35.130
keeps breaking into my houses?

53:35.170 --> 53:36.500
I have my people
working on it...

53:36.540 --> 53:38.170
people you don't need
to know about...

53:38.210 --> 53:39.920
and if they could find
a certain blue dress...

53:39.960 --> 53:43.760
and they by God did, they can
find this weasel like that.

53:43.800 --> 53:46.930
Max, why not just give back
the goddamn ring?

53:47.010 --> 53:49.470
We've got bigger fish to fry.
It's not your ring.

53:49.520 --> 53:52.310
- It's not mine?
- No, it's not your ring.

53:52.350 --> 53:53.400
You stole it. Give it back.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.690
This wacko breaks into my house
and tries to steal my stuff...

53:56.730 --> 53:58.320
and this isn't my ring, Walter?

53:58.360 --> 53:59.820
Spoils of war.

53:59.860 --> 54:02.700
Spoils of war.
Right. Goddamn right, Earl.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.450
Max, you've got
a lot of business...

54:04.490 --> 54:06.570
in gray areas at the moment.

54:06.620 --> 54:07.780
You're letting a small-timer...

54:07.830 --> 54:09.620
distract you
from the bigger picture.

54:09.660 --> 54:12.210
Sometimes you have to give back
a little to get a lot.

54:12.250 --> 54:15.670
It ain't gonna happen, Walter.
It is not gonna happen.

54:15.710 --> 54:17.790
I want to go home!

54:17.840 --> 54:20.710
What does this look like,
a taxi?

54:20.840 --> 54:23.470
Dial Lutetia.

54:28.010 --> 54:29.470
Ah! Now we're in business.

54:29.510 --> 54:32.560
OK.
To hell with the monuments.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.640
Here we go. Savvy shopping
in the nation's capital.

54:34.690 --> 54:37.610
We're gonna go to Georgetown.
You're gonna freak out.

54:37.650 --> 54:39.360
Oh, man, it's a bad angle.

54:39.400 --> 54:41.480
I can't get a clear look
at his place from here.

54:41.530 --> 54:43.400
So, hey, how are you guys
gonna get past the doorman?

54:43.450 --> 54:44.530
Nothin' fancy.

54:44.570 --> 54:46.950
Just stroll right in
like we own the place.

54:46.990 --> 54:48.660
Welcome to Potomac House.

54:48.700 --> 54:50.160
Our apartments
on the east side...

54:50.200 --> 54:52.410
have magnificent views
of the capitol.

54:52.450 --> 54:55.960
Our penthouse suites
are five thousand square feet...

54:56.040 --> 54:58.590
and have three hundred and sixty
degree vistas...

54:58.670 --> 55:00.670
but, of course, there...

55:00.750 --> 55:03.880
we're talking about
quite a bit of money.

55:18.650 --> 55:20.360
Salaam. Salaam. Kuwait.

55:20.400 --> 55:24.150
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I most humbly apologize.

55:24.190 --> 55:25.820
However, there seems
to be a confusion...

55:25.860 --> 55:27.200
because the prince
would like to know...

55:27.280 --> 55:28.950
how much
for the entire building.

55:29.030 --> 55:31.080
Wait. Let me see is correct.

55:31.160 --> 55:33.290
- Hassim yassi.
- Correct.

55:33.370 --> 55:36.960
I'm not sure that's possible.

55:58.600 --> 56:02.400
Get up! Oh, maladar! Ah-kleck!

56:02.480 --> 56:05.030
Salaam, salaam, salaam.
He say, "For right amount...

56:05.110 --> 56:08.490
camel can dance up pyramid. "

56:08.740 --> 56:11.160
It loses something
in translation.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.740
Why don't you take the elevator
up to the penthouse suite...

56:13.790 --> 56:15.080
and I'll gather
some of my people together...

56:15.120 --> 56:16.500
and meet you up there.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.620
Make yourselves at home.

56:18.670 --> 56:21.790
It may be your home.

56:22.590 --> 56:23.710
Home.

56:23.750 --> 56:28.510
Go.
Give her big bug, beef jerky?

56:29.010 --> 56:32.680
Mine, all mine.

56:32.720 --> 56:34.220
He say
he would like to hump you...

56:34.260 --> 56:35.720
but we are
on a very tight schedule.

56:35.770 --> 56:37.890
Salaam aleichem.

56:38.020 --> 56:40.850
Come on, Berger.

56:49.780 --> 56:52.570
Is anybody home?

56:58.660 --> 56:59.910
What are you looking at?

56:59.960 --> 57:02.960
Nothing. You just look great
in a tablecloth, man.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.130
Not a lot of people
could pull it off.

57:04.170 --> 57:05.590
I mean, look at Arafat.
I mean, look at me.

57:05.670 --> 57:08.300
I look like
I should be driving a cab.

57:08.920 --> 57:11.760
Damn.
So this is Max's D. C. pad, huh?

57:11.800 --> 57:14.640
Mebala.

57:14.720 --> 57:18.430
Maxie? Maxie waxie?

57:18.480 --> 57:21.310
Your friends are here.

57:23.650 --> 57:26.690
- Watch your step, sir.
- Whoa! I'm all right.

57:28.190 --> 57:30.360
We'll meet back at my place
to prep for the hearing.

57:30.400 --> 57:32.160
All right, Max.

57:32.200 --> 57:36.490
Earl, you call me the minute
you hear anything, you got it?

57:36.530 --> 57:38.870
On it.

57:41.080 --> 57:43.750
Wonder where lard-ass is.

57:43.880 --> 57:46.170
Hello? Are you there?

57:46.340 --> 57:47.800
Max, it's Gloria.

57:47.880 --> 57:50.670
Pick up, Max.

57:50.840 --> 57:52.180
We're in the clear.
It's the phone.

57:52.220 --> 57:53.510
Are you there?

57:53.550 --> 57:57.180
Well, I just wanted to let you
know the money is in your desk.

57:57.220 --> 58:00.310
I mean, the contributions
for the senators.

58:00.350 --> 58:03.310
You may want to call me
for a reading with the cards.

58:03.350 --> 58:04.520
It's a PAC,
just like Shelly said.

58:04.560 --> 58:07.230
You still need me for the cards,
don't you, baby?

58:07.270 --> 58:10.070
So sad.

58:14.280 --> 58:16.240
The marrying maiden.

58:16.280 --> 58:18.990
What the hell's
that got to do with me?

58:19.080 --> 58:21.040
The ring.

58:21.080 --> 58:24.330
The thief.

58:25.130 --> 58:27.710
The castle.

58:27.750 --> 58:31.800
The thief is in the castle.
Dial Earl.

58:32.420 --> 58:33.800
Got it. Here they are.

58:33.840 --> 58:36.430
Look at that.

58:37.470 --> 58:39.890
See, you can't outright
just bribe these senators.

58:39.930 --> 58:41.980
You gotta give the money
to these PACs.

58:42.020 --> 58:43.890
PACs. I don't know.
It stands for something.

58:43.940 --> 58:47.230
Why don't you just save it
for the senators?

58:49.270 --> 58:51.690
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

58:51.780 --> 58:54.990
Earl, he's in my place.
He's at my apartment.

58:55.070 --> 58:56.410
Get the cops
and meet me over there.

58:56.450 --> 58:59.410
I'm going up the back way.

59:04.330 --> 59:05.870
Welcome back, Mr. Fairbanks.

59:05.960 --> 59:12.250
"... this, and eat shit.
Love, Max. "

59:12.880 --> 59:17.090
A hundred and fifteen thousand
dollars cash.

59:17.140 --> 59:20.680
- The greatest crime.
- Maybe we should go, huh?

59:20.720 --> 59:23.100
What, and leave the ring?

59:24.480 --> 59:27.060
- Welcome back, Mr. Radburn.
- Not now.

59:27.150 --> 59:28.770
- Come on, let's go. Come on.
- Stop worrying, OK?

59:28.860 --> 59:29.940
I gotta get this ring.

59:30.020 --> 59:32.860
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have a prison record.

59:32.900 --> 59:36.070
I got some good undershirts,
didn't l?

59:36.200 --> 59:38.360
Oh, my God. Kevin.

59:40.280 --> 59:41.700
I told you,
let's get out of here.

59:41.740 --> 59:43.910
What?

59:44.200 --> 59:47.370
- I knew this was gonna happen.
- Berger's got his pager.

59:50.540 --> 59:52.960
God, I'm hard.

59:56.470 --> 01:00:00.390
Earl Radburn,
head of security, T. U. l.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.020
Come on, let's go out the back.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:27.290
It's me, you idiot.

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.670
Sorry,
but they went out the back!

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:33.590
I came up the back. Moron.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:41.010
Oh, my goodness.
Well, you have to hold it in.

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:04.700
- Let's get the hell out of here!
- Going out the back, huh?

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.410
I'm gonna call the cell phone.

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:08.710
Come on. We got the money.
Let's go, let's go.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.920
You really need help, man,
I'm telling you.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.250
Aah! Oh, you got me!

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:22.300
- Berger, what's going on?
- Take a good look at me, huh?

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:24.550
It's kind of hard to describe.
Look, I gotta go.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.220
Talk to me!

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:32.730
Yeah, look at you,
falling all over yourself. Ah!

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:34.650
You brought it--Aah!

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:38.190
Look at you! Oh!

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:52.000
The wrong damn ring?

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.090
Amber,
I got the wrong finger, OK?

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.840
His damn wedding ring.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.300
Baby, say something.

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.470
You ain't said a word to me
since we left Washington.

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:07.890
Can I get some convo?

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:13.100
OK. I have never been so scared
in my whole life.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.810
All right, now, calm down, OK?

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.400
I know it was sort of unusual.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.530
Unusual?
Oh, come on, Kevin.

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:21.820
There were guns.
There were cops.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.200
Well, it's really not that bad
when you're in the middle of it.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.740
You know, your adrenaline
gets to pumping so hard...

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.120
you really don't think about--

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.460
- The consequences?
- Yeah, yeah, the consequences.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.250
Kevin, this has got to stop.

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.750
You don't need to prove
that you love me.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.260
I know you do...

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.840
and I don't care about that
stupid ring, do you hear me?

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.430
I just want you.

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:50.010
Well, then, don't worry.
You got me.

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.850
So you'll forget
about the ring, then?

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:04.530
Amber,
I'll forget about the ring.

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:07.450
It's forgotten.

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:09.200
Excuse me!

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.950
Hey, what's up, girls?
How you doin'?

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:13.160
Sorry.

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.790
Yo, Jack. It's after 7:00.

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.290
You seen your nephew
by the name of Kevin?

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.500
No. What your rappin' ass
want with him?

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:22.090
Later, man.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.670
Son of a bitch crazy.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.560
- That's twice you ran out on me.
- I know, but I'm sor--

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.180
Oh, it was funny how you never
cramp up when you gotta run.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.640
Kevin, I got low potassium, man.
When I don't eat my bananas...

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.310
I cramp up, dog. You know that.
Come on, man.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:39.610
Wait. What are you gonna do
with that doughnut?

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.530
Oh, you want this?
Run get that.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:45.030
Yo, Kev,
thanks for the breakfast, man.

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:47.160
- Here. You got that?
- No doubt.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.870
Hey, come on. Let's see it.
Let's see it, man.

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:51.620
All right, cool.
Bam! Done!

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.620
See? I came through, man.
If it wasn't for me...

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.160
That's what so great
about this country.

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:57.540
We're hand in hand,
synergistically...

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:58.710
going forward into the future.

01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:01.210
That's the way it is.
It's give and take...

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.380
and that's the way we feel
at T. U. l.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.880
You make a compelling point,
Mr. Fairbanks. Please continue.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.680
Thank you, senator.
As I was saying...

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.970
restrictive monopoly laws...

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:12.850
are choking communications
companies like mine.

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:15.730
If T. U. l. can dominate a market,
why hold us back?

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:18.060
T. U. l. provides employment...

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.690
which in turn provides
tax revenues...

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:23.400
in large markets
and in small alike.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.240
I contend that the laws
that limit ownership...

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.120
of television stations by
telecommunications companies...

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.780
are punitive and wrong.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:38.830
What's with Mount Rushmore
up there?

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.290
Guess who, shit box.

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.920
Ooh, it's the little thief.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.220
I beg your pardon?

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.590
No, I'm not talking to you.

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:51.890
Oh, man, I made, what,
two hundred grand robbing you?

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:53.350
I wouldn't call that
"little" anything.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.720
State of mind.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.600
What are you yammering about,
Mr. Fairbanks?

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.930
I'm not talking to you.
Excuse me.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.270
Well, let me tell you
what state of mind I'm in.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:01.900
My lady's getting sick and tired
of this whole thing...

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.110
so I thought it would be easier
for the both of us...

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:06.070
if you just
give me back my ring...

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:07.440
and I give you back yours.

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:08.740
Now, nod your head...

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.910
'cause I'm watching
your little ass on TV.

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:16.290
TV? Which camera? This camera?

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.410
Exactly. That one right there.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.580
Hold your head up...

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.790
'cause you got that
double chin thing happening.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.300
Damn, that's cold.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.090
Take a good look,
you [Bleep] asshole.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.470
Does this look like the face
of a man who got where he is...

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:32.930
by giving [bleep] away?
[Bleep] you.

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:34.850
Mr. Fairbanks.

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:37.720
Cussing on TV. He cussing on TV.
He dying.

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:40.390
I think he's angry.
I think he's perturbed.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.100
- Mr. Fairbanks--
- Walter--

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.310
- Hang up the phone!
- Mr. Fairbanks!

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.480
Just a minute.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.610
It looks like the face of a man
who don't have a damn clue.

01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:49.740
- I took your PAC money.
- Oh, yeah?

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.490
That's why all those little
fat white asses...

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:52.700
ain't rolling over for you.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.820
Mr. Fairbanks,
a little respect, please.

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:58.540
- Just a minute.
- Now, you give me my ring...

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.620
- and I'll leave you alone.
- I'm addressing you.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.920
Well, you know what you can do,
scumbucket?

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.460
- You can [bleep] my [bleep].
- Mr. Fairbanks!

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.340
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.460
C- SPAN's gotten better.

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:11.050
All right, that's it.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:13.010
The ring's
coming off your finger...

01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:14.430
if I got to cut it off.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.720
Oh, yeah? [Bleep] you
and [bleep] your girlfriend.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.100
My girlfriend?

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.730
This is a senate subcommittee,
Mr. Fairbanks.

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:25.730
[Bleep] you, [bleep] you,
[bleep] you.

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:33.570
I love democracy.

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.660
That's what I call
entertainment.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.700
That's what I call
entertainment.

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.000
I told you this no-good gonif...

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.330
was gonna make
a fool out of you.

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:47.670
Look what you've done
over a stupid goddamn ring.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.090
I could've fixed the PAC thing.
You blew a whole market.

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:52.470
You blew millions.
I hope you're satisfied.

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:55.010
Walter, why don't you
go see a doctor...

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:57.010
and ask him if he can find
some ghostly outline...

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.260
where your balls used to be...

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.850
and then plead with him
to stitch another pair back on?

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:08.310
Stop the car, please.

01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:12.230
What?

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:15.280
Max, I have been your lawyer
for twenty years.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.370
I have taken
your degrading insults...

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:18.530
and your petty mockeries.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.620
I have stood by you...

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.750
while you've bent the law and
while you've broken the law...

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:23.910
because there's
something fascinating...

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.330
in seeing how low you can go...

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.960
and I felt a genuine kind
of pity for someone so driven.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.250
But if you're gonna continue...

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:31.880
to play
this idiotic schoolyard game...

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.090
over a cheap and ugly,
by the way, ring...

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:38.390
this is the end of the line.
I am getting off the bus.

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:41.060
Limo.

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:47.900
Screw you, Max,
and the limo you rode in on.

01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:51.690
Where are you going?

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.610
Come on. Get back in the car.

01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:56.650
Go with him. Go with him.
Walter.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.860
Come on.

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:04.290
You can't walk all the way home.
What are you going to do?

01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:07.120
Guess I went a little
too far this time, Earl.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:08.330
Yes, sir.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.670
- You've been hacked.
- What?

01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:11.920
One of my people found out...

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.090
our "friend" has been able
to track your whereabouts...

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:17.130
by intercepting your e-mails.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:20.470
Why, that little son of a--

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:24.470
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This could be good, Earl.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.270
Yeah, because now we can
control the situation.

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:29.979
We can let him know exactly
what we want him to know.

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.399
Bring him right to us.

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:34.439
You're one crafty bastard, Earl.

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:36.240
Thank you, sir.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.200
If the boys at the Pentagon
had had your faith in me...

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:41.279
there'd be a Disney World
in Cuba right now.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:47.830
All right. Go on.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.760
The driver gave us a pretty good
description of the robbers.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:06.060
Too good. I've done some costume
design in community theater...

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.310
so I've seen my share
of bad acting.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:09.689
Assign one of our people...

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.350
to shadow
the driver and his assistant.

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:13.899
It's too tempting when one is
around that much cash every day.

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:15.319
You got it, detective.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.740
Oh, there he is. Hey, Tardio.

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:19.529
Got all these files you asked
for concerning Fairbanks.

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:21.529
- Thank you, Jerry.
- No problem.

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:24.279
Didn't I see you at the lce
Capades show last Monday?

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:28.910
Come on, Tardio.
I don't do lce Capades.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.880
The shoes say butch,
but the socks say...

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.420
"Hi, how you doin'? "

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.180
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, baby.

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.680
- Where's Amber?
- She asked for the day off.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.270
I knew she was upset.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.600
Amber got a pretty good
head on her shoulders.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.900
Maybe you need to listen
to what she has to say.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.360
You don't even like Amber.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.440
Amber and I happen to agree
on this one...

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:01.740
so therefore I say she OK.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.700
- But?
- But?

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.410
But you making this thing
personal with this Fairbanks...

01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:08.160
and that's bad for business.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.040
And that's the first thing
I taught you about this game.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.080
Kevin, I got two words for you.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.090
- Bankruptcy auction.
- What?

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:16.420
I just got off the phone
with Shelly.

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.630
- He hacked into their e-mail.
- Talk to me.

01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:20.220
Fairbanks is gonna be
at his beach house...

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.930
for a bankruptcy auction
the day after tomorrow...

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:24.300
and after, he's gonna be out of
the country for a couple months.

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:26.970
Leave it alone, son.
This is your old uncle Jack.

01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:28.310
If you only listen to me
one time...

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:30.730
for the rest of your life,
listen to me now.

01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:32.890
Take it from a man
who raised you from a pup.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.610
Let it go. I seen other guys
go down the road you're going...

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:39.070
and you know
what they call that? Dead end.

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:42.070
Let it go, Kevin.
Goddamn, Kevin, let it go.

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:44.860
Seven million dollars worth
of art, jewelry, and antiques.

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.910
I'll drive. Hand me my keys over
there, right underneath there.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:51.660
Come on, Lutetia.
Don't worry about it.

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:54.500
Nobody even watches
these hearings. Excuse me.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:57.170
You've gone too far, Max.
Swearing on TV?

01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:58.380
You make a fool
out of yourself...

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.260
publicly humiliate
the both of us...

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.800
and put your entire company
at risk, for what?

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.720
Some trinket
out of a crackerjack box?

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.930
Look, when I catch
this little putz--

01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:08.100
Don't come home, Max.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:11.390
- What?
- You're a jerk. Grow up.

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:18.520
Where's my lover? All right.

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:22.280
Berger was looking for you.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.030
He found me.

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:28.490
How you doin'?

01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:32.290
You're going, aren't you?

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.120
Look, Amber,
you gave me something.

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:37.210
I lost it.
I can't have that between us.

01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:39.130
Well, I would much rather
have that between us...

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:41.460
than two inches of glass
at some state prison.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.050
I'm sorry, you know?
A man in my position--

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:47.180
You know, you have always
said this is about me.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.050
This has never been
anything more...

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:51.810
than a juvenile
dick- measuring contest.

01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:54.640
Wait a minute. If this was
a dick-measuring contest...

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.810
I'd be declared the winner.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.310
Baby elephant trunk.

01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:02.150
Baby, I'm just playing.

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:03.320
You know
I'm just messing with you.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.610
Kevin, grow up.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.700
He's making me nuts. I don't
know what to do with him.

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.210
- So, what's the pre-nup like?
- There isn't one.

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:17.830
Then divorce him.
Cream the bastard.

01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:20.920
Oh, I don't know. I don't know
what this says about me...

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.710
but I'm kind of fond
of the old dog.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.260
I mean, s--

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.840
- ls Jack inside?
- I think so.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.530
Man trouble?

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:53.700
It's always man trouble.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.450
Well, now you got
woman trouble, too.

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:59.120
That's my jacket.
What are you doing with it?

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:01.750
- You're the thief's wife.
- The thief?

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.050
- Your husband stole my ring.
- What?

01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:06.800
That was my ring,
and I gave it to my boyfriend.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.890
You want your jacket?
Have your jacket.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.310
Wait a minute.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.390
Wait a minute.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.860
Pull daddy like a chariot.

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:33.870
Look, kids.
Oh, what a beautiful child!

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.410
- Thanks.
- Boy? Girl? Doesn't matter.

01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:39.710
Lovely child. So innocent.

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.460
Damn. Where's that lens?

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.340
- What a nice surprise.
- Yes, it is, isn't it?

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.050
Hey, you feel like
taking a walk?

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:55.930
Sounds good,
but I got to go see an optician.

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:58.430
Yeah. You know, right now
my eye is acting up.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.390
You're a little blurry
right now.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.060
Really? Is that blurry?

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:04.940
Uh, no. I see that just fine.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.900
That's good. Relax, would you?

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.740
This is just an overlap
of two connected worlds.

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.070
You never cross your line,
I never cross mine.

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:16.530
Know what I mean, Kevin?

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:20.620
- Damn!
- Just gas. Poor little thing.

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:23.420
Even in the outdoors, huh?

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.460
So what's new, Kevin?

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.960
Uh, nothing.
Just playing at golf.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.880
Doing that Tiger Woods thing.

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:32.130
You?

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.970
Oh, busy. There's still
a lot of crime out there.

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:36.140
Well, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.810
Especially
after all your efforts.

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:39.520
It can be time-consuming.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.480
I guess that's why I never
took up a sport like you.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.640
Although for some reason...

01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:45.650
I've always been drawn
to figure skating.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.650
Speaking of crime, do you know
what crime I hate the most?

01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:51.400
- lnsurance fraud.
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.740
Because the crook is using me.

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.320
"Oh, detective,
they took everything...

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:56.990
"and here's the list
of the stolen items...

01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:58.160
"and can I have
that docket number...

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.540
"so I can claim
my insurance money? "

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:03.000
Nothing makes me angrier
than trying to solve a case...

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.870
that never happened.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:09.000
So you think you got a burglary
that doesn't smell right?

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:11.630
Big townhouse. Beacon Hill.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.630
I'm wondering if the arrogant
son of a bitch bankrupt bum...

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.640
who owns the place
maybe didn't set it up himself.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.350
Yeah, well...

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:23.020
I didn't--I didn't hear nothing
about no scam...

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:26.350
but if I do, I'll let you know.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:30.230
Do you still blink when you're
not telling the truth, Kevin?

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:33.860
Must be the contact lenses.
Walkies.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.200
Come on, Pix.
We gotta get you a bran muffin.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.450
We're getting everybody
bran muffins. Good, good.

01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:41.040
Be cool.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.410
Mr. Man.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.080
Gloria, what the hell
are you doing here?

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.580
I drove out here because there's
something I need to tell you.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.750
Here, pick one.

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:28.540
Any one.

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:34.840
- Yep. There it is again.
- What does it mean?

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.420
The guy's got five daggers
in his head.

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:37.720
What do you think it means?

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.340
How bad is it?

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.260
I guess a guy with six daggers
in his head would be worse...

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.560
but they don't make that card.

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:45.930
It just keeps coming up.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.560
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.400
Would you have listened to me?
Do you ever listen to anybody?

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.400
Max, put a stop to all of this.
No good is gonna come of it.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.990
- I can't.
- Why?

01:16:57.030 --> 01:17:00.280
I can't, I can't, I can't!

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.740
Once a man in my position
gives in...

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.200
lets his defenses down...

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.290
is weak for one single moment,
he's dead.

01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:08.540
Dead, you understand?

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:11.290
That's the way it is
with animals in the jungle...

01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:12.460
that's the way it is with me.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.800
Oh, cut the crap, Max.
It's only a ring.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.630
A silly, stupid ring!

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:19.340
Yeah, and a bone
is just a bone...

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:21.220
until two lions decide...

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:23.470
that only one of them
is gonna walk away with it.

01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:26.930
You know what your problem is?
You always have to win.

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.480
You figure out
what it is you want...

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.020
and then you'll do anything
to get it...

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.270
and when you get it,
you toss it aside...

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:33.730
and move on to the next thing.

01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:35.110
I loved you, Max.

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.820
I knew who you were,
and I still loved you.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.990
Who else can say that?

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:42.120
You know who you are, and you
can barely tolerate yourself.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.740
Nobody talks to me that way.
Nobody.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:48.250
- I do!
- That turns me on.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:57.050
No! Get off me!

01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:58.840
Ow! What?

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.510
You're doing it again,
you horny little bastard.

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:03.510
Give me a hand.
You hurt my back.

01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:05.930
No. I quit, Max. Good-bye.

01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:07.470
Come on. Glor--

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.140
You quit? You're fired!

01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:12.850
There goes
your medical and your dental!

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.860
You know what? I don't need it.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.230
And I don't need you.

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:20.860
All right.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.530
- Hello, hello.
- Buzz off.

01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:24.700
I was--

01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:27.370
Compound secure, chief.

01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:30.250
Come here.

01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:34.330
I am so flattered, sir.

01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.540
I've thought about this, too.
More than once.

01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:39.880
But honestly,
an employer and employee--

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.220
what are the percentages?

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:45.180
I just want you to help me up.
I hurt my back.

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.350
That was a joke, by the way,
and--and a good one.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.360
Goddamn vultures
are starting to circle.

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:08.910
Make yourselves at home,
scumbags!

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.160
Calm down, Max. You're gonna
give yourself a coronary.

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.120
I don't have coronaries.
I give them.

01:19:14.170 --> 01:19:15.670
Well, I know
this is tough for you...

01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:18.130
so I just called
to wish you well.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.210
My therapist won't be happy
about that, but what can I say?

01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.720
I have a soft spot for you.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.090
Well, thanks, Lutetia,
I appreciate it.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.470
You might be an asshole, Max,
but you're my asshole.

01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:30.430
Thanks again.

01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:33.980
- Masseuse.
- I didn't order a masseuse.

01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:38.400
I sent her over.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.280
I thought you might need
to relax.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.780
You sent me a masseuse?

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.490
The therapeutic kind, Max...

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:46.030
not the kind you're used to.

01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:49.080
l- I'll call you later, Lutetia.
Thanks.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.490
It's all right, sweetie.

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.290
I'll get back
and check the tube, sir.

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:57.500
We're gonna nail this thief...

01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:58.840
just so bad
you won't even believe it.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.710
Yeah, yeah, go nail him.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.760
About last night,
I just want you to know--

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.340
- Get out of here!
- All right, sir.

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:16.350
Yes. I'll do it.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.770
Wonderful.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.070
Yeah, come here, baby.

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.570
Must go walkies in the park

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.880
- Excuse me.
- Go away.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.500
Can't do it, sir.

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:43.920
Sorry, sir.
I heard the groaning...

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.920
but I'm afraid we need you.
The auction's about to start.

01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:46.010
but I'm afraid we need you.
The auction's about to start.

01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:49.800
- Any sign of him?
- Not yet.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.140
Would you like
a little massage oil?

01:20:57.230 --> 01:21:01.060
Ooh, yeah.
A little massage oil.

01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:06.070
More is coming. I shall return.

01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:07.610
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:10.320
Coconut shrimps are flying
like hotcakes. Hey, wait.

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:11.740
You hitting that champagne?
Your eyes look funny.

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:14.240
No, it's my allergies.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.620
Don't get up.

01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:23.000
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.420

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.840
Mr. Boyle regrets
that he cannot be here...

01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:30.720
to conduct the auction
as planned...

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.350

01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:58.030
Will you slow down?

01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:00.200
Look, it's almost 2:00.
You gotta move your fat ass.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.490
Hey, that hurts my feelings.

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.750
Oh, what feelings?
You got no feelings.

01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:04.870

01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:26.730
Yo, big Max, now it's on.

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:30.690
It's 2:00,
and it's time for the bomb.

01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:34.530
Hey, how you doing?

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:36.240
Listen, Max...

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:39.070
I'm sure by the time you see
this you're gonna be pissed...

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.330
but I want to thank you...

01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:43.700

Where is he?

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:33.290
Didn't I tell you
you could do it?

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.050
Look at the mess I caused.
Wait'll I tell the kids.

01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:37.260
Tell them, tell them.

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:40.260

- Yes, sir. Where's Kevin?

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:47.640

- Fellas, we rich.
- Yeah, we're rich!

01:25:49.890 --> 01:25:51.350
- Filthy rich.
- I can't believe it!

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.560
I deserve it!

01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:55.530

Where the hell is he?

01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:08.000
No, get off of me!
No, leave me alone!

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.410
I'm looking for somebody.

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.330
Let go of me! Let go of me!

01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:15.460
Max! Oh, I love this. Max!

01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:18.130
I'm sorry, Max.

01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:19.760
I'm all right, OK?

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.930
You understand? I'm OK!

01:26:21.970 --> 01:26:24.390
Jesus!

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:33.350
Son of a...

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:36.400
bitch!

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:40.990
You think you're getting away.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.280
Your ass is mine!

01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:47.280
Your ass is mine!

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.210
Stinking thief!

01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:54.830
Oh, my!

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.750
You're not getting away.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.020
- Get off me!
- Give to me!

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.040
Give me it, you son of a bitch!

01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:40.090
Give me that ring.

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:42.760
- Oh, shit! Man!
- There's water!

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.470
Wait, wait. This ain't the ring.

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:46.800
- Wait are you trying to pull?
- That ain't the ring!

01:27:46.890 --> 01:27:48.260
What do you mean,
that ain't the ring?

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.430
Whoa, water!

01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:52.270
- Look.
- What?

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:54.810
- This has an inscription inside.
- lnscription?

01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:58.190
Yeah, it says, "Grow up. "

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.110
My lady said that to me.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.440
My wife told me the same thing.

01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:05.610
Damn! Lutetia did this.

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:09.280
She got that masseuse to oil it
right off my finger.

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:13.040
You--you joking, right?

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:17.750
Let me see that.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.170
We're going down, man.

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:24.010
Max Fairbanks?

01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:27.720
Max Fairbanks?
That's right. It's me...

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.140
and I'm arresting you
under suspicion...

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:31.810
of bankruptcy
and insurance fraud.

01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:37.390
Prove it!

01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:43.980
Oh! A woman scorned.

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.530
Kevin Caffrey.

01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:50.660
Is that you?

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.910
Hey! What up, Tardio?

01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:57.670
Kevin, what are you doing here?

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.540
Well, uh...

01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:03.630
I swam out...

01:29:03.710 --> 01:29:08.180
when I saw that my fellow man
was in trouble.

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.310
He's a total stranger.

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:19.350
Never saw him before!
Trés bizarre.

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.900
Oh, yes. Trés bizarre.

01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:26.740
Not as bizarre as you.

01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:28.700
Thanks, Max.
I owe you one, man.

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.070
Ah, don't mention it.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.870
You and me,
we both love the game.

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:35.000
There's no need to be penalized
for that.

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.460
OK, come to Tardio.

01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:39.960
Go get 'em, boys and girls.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.380
- Yes, sir.
- OK.

01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:00.770
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, nothing.

01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:04.610
That's my man. Go get her.

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:11.360
You? The masseuse?

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.410
I massaged that baby right off
his hairy little finger.

01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:19.580
His wife and l
decided you two had it coming.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.080
You're amazing.

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.710
See that ring?

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.920
I think it's got
the wrong kind of luck.

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.760
- Throw it away.
- Throw it away?

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.930
- We worked so hard to--
- Throw it away.

01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:35.600
Gone.

01:30:42.230 --> 01:30:44.610
This is Kerry Kilbride
reporting from Washington...

01:30:44.650 --> 01:30:47.110
where just moments ago
a Senate committee ended...

01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:48.990
its long-standing
investigation...

01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:51.780
into the alleged media
and broadcasting monopoly...

01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.490
of billionaire businessman
Max Fairbanks.

01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:57.330
Through a series of quick and
effective legal maneuverings...

01:30:57.370 --> 01:30:59.950
Mr. Fairbanks
and his attorney...

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.000
have taken
the wind out of the sails...

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.170
of the Senate committee.

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:04.580
Shook 'em down.

01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:06.590
Brother hoodwinked
the entire Senate committee.

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:07.960
That's my boy.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.470
Put on your rubber boots,
'cause here comes the bullshit.

01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:13.550
We now go directly to the scene
with Tracey Kimberly.

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:14.800
This is Tracey Kimberly...

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.680
reporting live
from the capitol...

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.430
where we have just witnessed
a stunning turn of events...

01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:21.640
orchestrated by
a relatively unknown lawyer...

01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:23.730
from the firm
of Whiteman, Small, Johnson.

01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:27.150
- Whiteman, Small, Johnson?
- What do you mean by that?

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:30.440
Here he comes now.

01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:33.740
Oh, look! That's my boy!
Look, he on TV?

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.280
Yo, look at that!
He got that big--

01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:37.870
Oh, no, he didn't!

01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:42.250
I'd like to say
power to the people.

01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:45.330
Let's rise up.
A quick shout out to my mama.

01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:46.840
Mama, I love you.

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.170
Mr. Fairbanks,
do you have a statement?

01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:51.260
Ladies and gentlemen,
I was dragged through the mud...

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:53.470
I was tarred and feathered
in the streets.

01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:56.510
- Can we get an "Oop" up in here?
- Up in here!

01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:58.850
I was bent over and stuffed
like a Christmas goose.

01:31:58.890 --> 01:32:00.180
Can I get an "Ouch!
That's hurts"?

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.850
Ouch! That hurts!

01:32:01.890 --> 01:32:05.900
But in the end,
the senators saw the truth--

01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:08.980
that I'm an honest
and legitimate businessman.

01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:12.530
Counselor, what exactly was your
game plan going in there today?

01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:14.360
Well, my brethren...

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:17.530
I'm not one to stand up here
and conversate out of my ass...

01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:21.160
nor am I gonna stand up here
and jerk you all off.

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:25.420
Besides the precedents
of Roe vs. Wade...

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:28.380
uh, my Uncle Ray-Ray
vs. the Dairy Queen...

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.800
I knew I had to get it
on the inside...

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:34.010
to the big man
for the easy lay-up.

01:32:34.050 --> 01:32:36.800
I am full of de facto...

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:40.600
habeas corpus
emancipation proclamation.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:46.060
I also have
a very, very big pro bono.

01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:48.230
Baby, it runs in the family.

01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:50.230
What do you believe changed
the senators' minds?

01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:52.400
Fourscore, darling!

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.070
Yeah, I mean, hey,
everybody makes mistakes...

01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:56.700
even senators.

01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:57.860
Are you implying
there were improprieties...

01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:59.280
on behalf of the senators?

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:03.120
Hey, man, I am a black male...

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:04.450
not a blackmailer.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.250
Nobody's perfect.

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:09.540
lsn't that right,
Senator Richards?

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.840
- Senator Richards!
- Senator!

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.720
Well, heh heh! I owe you one.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.430
Yeah. Hey, don't mention it.

01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:24.100
You just take care of yourself.

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.600
- Hey, right on.
- Right on!

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.690
What a guy.
