00:02.003 --> 00:02.869
Hello, Hank.

00:02.969 --> 00:05.438
Hi, Charlotte.

00:05.573 --> 00:09.776
I need rugs, tables, pictures, the works.

00:09.877 --> 00:10.943
Paige found us a new patient.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.979
- Ray Mazzarino?
- The mob guy?

00:13.114 --> 00:14.214
Hankmed's looking to grow,

00:14.315 --> 00:15.749
and we're having trouble
finding the right space.

00:15.850 --> 00:16.750
Let's make this easy.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.184
Do it as partners.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.620
I'm sorry Cinco hasn't
answered any of your texts.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.288
There's nothing else to talk about.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.791
Cinco is over me, and I am over him.

00:24.925 --> 00:27.127
Why would Oz want to make Hank look bad?

00:27.261 --> 00:29.462
What did you hear from
the rug restoration guys?

00:29.597 --> 00:32.665
It was deemed beyond repair.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.134
I know it's hard to send the rug back.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.135
I'm proud you could let go

00:35.269 --> 00:37.537
and that we can start fresh.

00:37.672 --> 00:39.673
[Chuckling] Not quite.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.207
What do you mean?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.343
I've been thinking about
your immigration hearing.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.978
I want to help any way I can.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.846
Sounds like Jeremiah hired you a lawyer.

00:46.981 --> 00:47.981
Would that be a problem?

00:48.082 --> 00:49.983
I thought I was doing the right thing.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.718
I need you to move out.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.425
Well, next week can't come soon enough.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.193
I'm glad everything at work is going well,

01:00.327 --> 01:02.362
and miss you, Charlotte.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.997
A lot.

01:04.131 --> 01:06.032
Yeah, well, I can't wait.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.368
Okay. Fair point.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.804
I will wait for that. [Chuckles]

01:10.938 --> 01:12.372
- Uh, okay.
- Oh,

01:12.506 --> 01:13.373
I got to go.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.175
Um... yeah, no, no. Me too.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.376
[Whispering] Say it. Say it.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.677
[Loudly] I love you, Charlotte.

01:17.812 --> 01:18.845
- Okay, bye.
- I love you.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.680
Thank you so much. Really. Very helpful.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.449
You can say "I love you"
to her in front of me.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.017
You know, I would never make fun of that.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.351
You just made fun of that.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.419
- Oh, I totally did.
- Yeah.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.454
Oh, never mind.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.523
Continue to hide your emotions from me.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.959
[Sighs]

01:33.094 --> 01:34.294
Is Emma home?

01:34.395 --> 01:35.595
Closing up at The Flying Point,

01:35.730 --> 01:37.397
then probably hanging out with Cinco.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.432
It's nice to see her
fitting in here, you know?

01:39.567 --> 01:40.900
Making her own way, working hard.

01:41.035 --> 01:41.901
Just like us.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.369
She's a good kid, huh?

01:43.471 --> 01:45.472
Wait. Why are you here so late?

01:45.606 --> 01:48.575
Just Paige is... Paige is working late

01:48.676 --> 01:51.644
at Ray's house... again.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.713
[Cell phone vibrates]

01:53.848 --> 01:56.082
Speaking of the love of my life.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.751
Hey, babe. I love you so much.

01:57.885 --> 01:58.785
I can do it. Okay?

01:58.919 --> 02:00.086
You're amazing.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.087
Huh?

02:01.188 --> 02:02.655
He what?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.991
Paige.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.392
Okay, just try to stay calm.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.228
I'm with Hank right now.
We're on our way, okay?

02:08.329 --> 02:09.329
What's wrong?

02:09.463 --> 02:10.729
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.634
[Indistinct PA announcement]

02:14.735 --> 02:16.035
I never should have mentioned it.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.137
You were doubled over.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.171
I had to call them.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.305
Okay, Ray, have a seat.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.507
I can walk.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.642
No, it's hospital policy. Tell him, Hank.

02:22.743 --> 02:23.877
- You can walk.
- See?

02:24.011 --> 02:25.478
What you can't do is work until midnight

02:25.613 --> 02:26.546
and ignore abdominal pain.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.781
See?

02:27.915 --> 02:30.150
You've recently been diagnosed with PSC.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.252
You need to take it easy.
Not run all over town.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.419
And back and forth to Jersey.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.888
Yeah, well, I'm a slave to business,

02:35.022 --> 02:36.289
Evan, just like you.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.458
I figured a perk of getting
into the medical profession

02:38.592 --> 02:39.659
would be avoiding hospitals.

02:39.794 --> 02:41.361
Well, in this case, you figured wrong.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.263
You've developed an
infection that could damage

02:43.397 --> 02:44.664
your liver and bile ducts.

02:44.799 --> 02:45.765
Come with me.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.433
You need a paracentesis to drain the fluid

02:47.568 --> 02:49.636
from your abdominal cavity
under ultrasound guidance.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.937
Huh?

02:51.071 --> 02:52.438
None of us understands
Hank when he talks like this.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.606
Just trust him.

02:53.741 --> 02:54.607
If you don't get treated promptly,

02:54.742 --> 02:55.809
this could kill you.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.010
Stay the night. I'll get you scheduled asap.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.011
I understand that.

02:58.112 --> 02:59.078
Shouldn't be a problem

02:59.213 --> 03:00.180
as long as the E.R. isn't too crazy.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.848
[Indistinct chatter]

03:01.982 --> 03:03.449
Whoa. Mascal?

03:03.584 --> 03:05.051
Restaurant fire. Flying point.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.253
- Flying...
- I'll call her.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.888
Three first- and second-degree burns,

03:08.989 --> 03:10.190
four smoke inhalations,

03:10.324 --> 03:11.891
one ankle fracture jumping out of a window.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.494
Ok. Uh, Rose, have you seen my sister?

03:14.595 --> 03:15.495
Her name's Emma Miller.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.398
- I haven't. No.
- [Cell phone jingling]

03:18.532 --> 03:19.399
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.834
Hey. I'm okay.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.969
Okay. Okay, good.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.737
Whew. Are you sure you're not hurt?

03:24.872 --> 03:25.738
Yeah. Yeah.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.773
What were you doing there so late?

03:26.907 --> 03:28.241
I thought that joint closes at 11:00.

03:28.375 --> 03:32.345
Sometimes the waitstaff
plays poker after hours.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.948
We smelled smoke coming from the kitchen,

03:35.082 --> 03:37.217
and then a couple of guys
went in there to check it out,

03:37.318 --> 03:39.652
but it was already up in flames.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.387
Whew. I'm just glad you're safe.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.190
So scary. Let's get you cleaned up.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.159
Wasn't there a fire alarm?

03:46.293 --> 03:47.160
Isn't that the law?

03:47.294 --> 03:50.630
Disconnected, probably.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.699
Look, sometimes the objective
of a business burning

03:52.800 --> 03:54.901
is to make sure it burns down.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.816 --> 04:11.417
Oh, um, who are you?

04:11.552 --> 04:13.853
Who are you?

04:13.988 --> 04:15.722
I live here.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.523
That would make two of us.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.024
Wait, you're Boris?

04:19.159 --> 04:20.260
You seem dubious.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.261
Sorry.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.529
You are just not what I expected.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.865
You thought I'd be older.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.867
I thought you'd be scarier.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.369
I see.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.071
Boris. What a surprise.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.072
I see you've met Emma.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.274
Indeed.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.642
Nice to meet you.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.643
You as well.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.284
Emma's the sister I told you about.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.019
- It turns out Eddie...
- Yeah.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.120
Yeah, Eddie.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.621
Enough said.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.657
Hank, I've come to ask you a favor.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.792
Ask or require?

04:52.927 --> 04:53.793
[Cell phone vibrates]

04:53.928 --> 04:54.794
Oh.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.833
Shall I come back?

05:00.968 --> 05:01.834
No, no. I'm sorry.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.169
It's from Charlotte.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.004
You remember, from Monaco?

05:05.139 --> 05:06.739
Charlotte is back in the picture?

05:06.874 --> 05:07.840
She is.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.475
Perhaps my request is untimely then.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.476
No, please.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.744
She's gone for another week.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.379
What do you need?

05:13.514 --> 05:16.115
Well, the results from the clinical trial

05:16.216 --> 05:18.618
were so positive that the double-blind study

05:18.752 --> 05:20.286
has been suspended.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.822
The new drug can now be
given to all participants.

05:22.957 --> 05:24.123
That's good news.

05:24.224 --> 05:27.393
Yeah, except the trial has run out of funds,

05:27.494 --> 05:30.596
so Marisa and I have
taken over this next phase.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.498
- Marisa's with you?
- No.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.300
She's in Russia evaluating someone

05:34.435 --> 05:37.303
with the same genetic marker,
and I've just been contacted

05:37.404 --> 05:41.908
by a potential candidate in Argentina.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.443
You want me to go to Argentina.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.878
We would go together just for a few days.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.447
[Sighs]

05:47.548 --> 05:49.649
Would it help if I said, "please"?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.287
Your jet or mine?

05:57.624 --> 05:58.524
End of a journey.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.360
Once this final item is returned

06:00.494 --> 06:03.296
to its rightful owner, your
conscience will be clear,

06:03.430 --> 06:04.630
but the work has just begun.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.065
I know. This is only the first step.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.101
The bigger hurdle will be proving I'm worthy

06:08.235 --> 06:09.235
of your trust again.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.236
We'll get there.

06:17.311 --> 06:18.177
Okay.

06:18.312 --> 06:20.980
Say your good-byes.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.823
They disowned you

06:30.958 --> 06:33.493
when they learned you
weren't created for a Czar.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.931
But I will always remember you
as nothing less than Fabergé?

06:43.637 --> 06:46.873
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.808
How many times do I have to tell you,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.543
you do not work on this property

06:50.677 --> 06:53.679
unless you are wearing
the proper staff uniform.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.681
Go.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.583
Russel Berger?

06:57.718 --> 06:58.785
What brings you here?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.487
A terrible mistake. Hi, Ms. Nguyen.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.757
I'm Paige Lawson, Russel's new partner.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.858
We recently...

07:05.993 --> 07:07.660
During last summer's appraisal,

07:07.795 --> 07:11.964
one of your items was lost in the shuffle.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.533
I've come to return your egg.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.835
Oh, I thought the maid stole it.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.438
I couldn't believe what I
got on the insurance claim

07:18.572 --> 07:19.872
considering it's not imperial.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.975
But still, an exquisite piece.

07:23.077 --> 07:25.311
We'd like to apologize to
your maid for the confusion.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.312
To Wendy?

07:26.447 --> 07:27.413
You can't.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.450
I fired her.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.119
So, speaking of hurdles...

07:33.253 --> 07:35.488
Let's go find Wendy.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.824
To characterize Hank as some kind of

07:37.958 --> 07:40.293
teen drug-pusher party doc... It's libelous.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.661
We should sue him. We should.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.729
Or them or whatever Oz is.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.998
Look, I don't like it either,
but any attention you bring

07:46.133 --> 07:47.767
to this guy is just
gonna build his audience.

07:47.901 --> 07:48.801
Yeah, Hank's right.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.236
Oz thrives in this kind of stuff.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.371
Besides, today's news is
all about last night's fire.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.074
"The flying inferno: Where are
the teen elite gonna brunch?"

07:55.175 --> 07:57.243
You know, rumor has it the
place was torched on purpose.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.178
Arson?

07:59.313 --> 08:00.947
All right. I am out of here.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.148
Wish me luck on the job search.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.516
Good luck on the job search.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.917
- Bye.
- All right.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.954
So first up, apologies for asking you guys

08:08.055 --> 08:10.556
to cover for me while I
help Boris this weekend,

08:10.657 --> 08:12.792
but Jeremiah assured
me we were pretty light.

08:12.893 --> 08:13.793
What?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.194
So we're already losing business

08:15.329 --> 08:17.196
to this stupid snark bite?

08:17.297 --> 08:19.699
Oh, no, statistically, week
24 is always light for us,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.135
falling in the trough between
Memorial Day and July 4th.

08:22.236 --> 08:23.636
And the percentage of...

08:23.770 --> 08:24.871
Thank you, Jeremiah. Thanks.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.439
So I added a patient to the end of the day.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.441
Divya, you and Jeremiah
should be able to handle it

08:28.575 --> 08:31.010
on your way home.

08:31.145 --> 08:32.712
Actually, you should know that Sashi and I

08:32.846 --> 08:34.380
are no longer living at Jeremiah's.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.049
What? When did that happen?

08:37.150 --> 08:38.650
I'm staying at my father's home for now,

08:38.784 --> 08:40.352
but I'll be happy to help with the patient.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.621
That won't be necessary.
I'd rather do it alone.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.525
Jeremiah, I know that you blame me...

08:45.659 --> 08:48.394
I don't want to discuss it.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.963
Okay. So something's going on.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.798
I was trying to look out for you.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.567
Viviana never asked me for anything.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.335
I'm sorry. Viviana?

08:56.436 --> 08:57.703
I know that you cared about her,

08:57.804 --> 08:59.338
but I was afraid she was using...

08:59.439 --> 09:01.974
Already had this conversation.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.809
You're wrong. You don't know her.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.578
Since you meddled, she won't accept my help,

09:05.712 --> 09:07.747
and now she will be deported.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.715
That is your fault.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.427
Don't worry.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.397
This won't affect Hankmed at all.

09:24.498 --> 09:27.333
Okay. Moving on.

09:27.729 --> 09:32.539

09:38.183 --> 09:39.951
See? This is nice.

09:40.052 --> 09:43.288
Wendy found another job
with quaint living quarters.

09:43.422 --> 09:45.523
If she's busy, we can just
leave this on her doorstep.

09:45.658 --> 09:48.092
No, you need to apologize to her directly

09:48.227 --> 09:50.662
for indirectly getting her fired.

09:50.796 --> 09:51.929
What did you bring her anyway?

09:52.031 --> 09:53.631
It's an uncut star Ruby crystal

09:53.732 --> 09:55.967
from the Luc Yen region of Vietnam.

09:56.101 --> 09:57.902
And where exactly did you get it?

09:58.003 --> 09:59.070
Relax.

09:59.204 --> 10:00.938
It's from my personal collection,

10:01.073 --> 10:02.807
which I paid for.

10:02.908 --> 10:03.808
Okay.

10:03.909 --> 10:04.976
We can help her auction it off

10:05.077 --> 10:07.478
if she needs the money.

10:07.579 --> 10:09.480
Wendy?

10:09.615 --> 10:10.615
[Sighs]

10:10.749 --> 10:13.351
Look, I already told the insurance people

10:13.485 --> 10:16.621
I never stole that pretty
egg or anything else.

10:16.722 --> 10:18.690
Yeah, we know.

10:18.824 --> 10:20.558
I'm Paige, and this is Russel.

10:20.693 --> 10:22.660
We called because we found the egg.

10:22.795 --> 10:24.862
We just returned it to Ms. Nguyen,

10:24.997 --> 10:27.732
which is when we found out
about your wrongful termination.

10:27.866 --> 10:29.300
Oh.

10:29.435 --> 10:32.003
Thank you, but you'll never get that woman

10:32.104 --> 10:33.438
to admit she was wrong.

10:33.572 --> 10:35.740
Well, we all know the truth,

10:35.874 --> 10:37.809
and we're glad to see
you found a new job here.

10:37.910 --> 10:39.711
Oh, I don't work here.

10:39.845 --> 10:41.813
My sister is this family's nanny.

10:41.947 --> 10:43.414
This is her cottage.

10:43.549 --> 10:45.350
I live in Queens now.

10:45.484 --> 10:46.918
Ah.

10:47.019 --> 10:48.453
Were you able to find another job?

10:48.587 --> 10:51.322
Yes. I'm even in a union now.

10:51.457 --> 10:53.491
The passenger service workers.

10:53.625 --> 10:56.361
Congratulations. A step up.

10:56.495 --> 10:58.996
- So you're here for a visit.
- I have the flu.

10:59.131 --> 11:01.966
My sister insisted that
I stay here and rest.

11:02.101 --> 11:04.469
I'm so glad you have someone
to take care of you.

11:04.570 --> 11:05.770
Mm, not this weekend.

11:05.904 --> 11:07.872
The family got invited to Martha's Vineyard,

11:07.973 --> 11:10.208
and they took my sister with them.

11:10.342 --> 11:13.511
But they were nice enough
to let me stay, so...

11:13.645 --> 11:15.313
[Coughing]

11:15.447 --> 11:20.485
Well, hopefully, this will
help make you feel better.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.086
Don't get too close.

11:22.221 --> 11:23.721
I've been like this for over a week,

11:23.856 --> 11:25.289
and I don't know what I have.

11:25.424 --> 11:29.994
[Sniffles, coughing]

11:30.095 --> 11:32.497
We should have someone take a look.

11:32.631 --> 11:34.632
Great idea.

11:40.139 --> 11:41.038
Hey there.

11:44.777 --> 11:48.045
So...

11:48.213 --> 11:51.115
About that staff meeting.

11:51.216 --> 11:55.386
- What about it?
- Well... [Clears throat]

11:55.521 --> 11:59.023
Clearly, some stuff went on
between you and Divya, right?

11:59.158 --> 12:03.361
Aand she seemed pretty upset about it, so...

12:03.462 --> 12:06.731
You know she adores you, right?

12:06.832 --> 12:09.233
Isn't she, like, your closest friend?

12:09.401 --> 12:12.036
I don't want to talk about Divya.

12:12.137 --> 12:14.005
Okay.

12:14.139 --> 12:16.841
Yeah, that's personal. I get it.

12:16.975 --> 12:18.843
All right.

12:18.977 --> 12:20.578
Well, if you want to talk...

12:20.679 --> 12:23.347
I do.

12:23.482 --> 12:25.516
I want to talk about Viviana.

12:25.651 --> 12:27.185
Oh, okay.

12:27.286 --> 12:29.821
How do I get her back?

12:29.955 --> 12:31.689
She wants nothing to do with me.

12:35.727 --> 12:36.961
[Sighs]

12:37.095 --> 12:38.963
Believe it or not,

12:39.064 --> 12:41.933
that is how Paige and I started out,

12:42.067 --> 12:44.936
but I just didn't give up.

12:46.705 --> 12:49.140
Don't give up.

12:49.274 --> 12:51.709
Didn't you mention she had,
like, an immigration problem?

12:51.844 --> 12:53.411
That's a perfect opportunity right there.

12:53.545 --> 12:57.381
You slay that dragon, you'll win her heart.

12:57.516 --> 12:59.250
She doesn't want my help.

12:59.384 --> 13:01.953
So help her without her knowing it.

13:02.054 --> 13:03.321
Then when she finds out it was you,

13:03.455 --> 13:06.023
you'll look generous and selfless.

13:06.158 --> 13:08.426
Bam. Win-win.

13:11.063 --> 13:12.964
It can't have been all your fault.

13:13.098 --> 13:14.866
It's all my fault.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.401
I really believed Viviana was using him.

13:17.536 --> 13:19.604
Using him? How?

13:19.705 --> 13:22.473
For his money. For a green card.

13:22.608 --> 13:25.810
I don't know, but you know how
vulnerable Jeremiah can be.

13:25.944 --> 13:27.812
Listen, I'm sure you had good intentions.

13:27.946 --> 13:29.614
Maybe you just went
about it in the wrong way.

13:29.748 --> 13:31.849
Hmm. Certainly did.

13:31.984 --> 13:33.885
And I feel terrible.

13:34.019 --> 13:36.854
You saw how much I hurt
him, how angry he was.

13:36.955 --> 13:38.990
Look, honestly, I didn't
know Jeremiah had it in him,

13:39.124 --> 13:41.826
but he made a strong case
for this Viviana person.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.463
I have to try to fix things
with him and apologize to her.

13:45.597 --> 13:47.164
Okay, you know what I think?

13:47.299 --> 13:48.733
Jumping into things caused this mess.

13:48.867 --> 13:50.434
Maybe you should just stay out of it

13:50.569 --> 13:51.802
till Jeremiah cools down.

13:51.937 --> 13:54.805
This one goes upstairs,
first room on the left.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.107
- Uh, Ray?
- One sec.

13:56.241 --> 13:57.575
You just got home from the hospital.

13:57.709 --> 13:58.976
This is the opposite of resting.

13:59.111 --> 14:00.278
I know. I know.

14:00.412 --> 14:02.213
But Paige put a rush on
deliveries for the house

14:02.314 --> 14:04.949
when she found out Olivia might
be coming out this weekend.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.484
- Oh, your wife's coming?
- Finally.

14:06.618 --> 14:08.286
Yeah. You'll see.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.555
She's real. I didn't make her up.

14:10.656 --> 14:11.756
That's great.

14:15.093 --> 14:16.260
You're right.

14:16.395 --> 14:18.396
I need to stay out of Jeremiah's business.

14:18.497 --> 14:22.700
Unfortunately, I've never really
been good at doing nothing.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.802
In fact, I already did a little something.

14:24.937 --> 14:26.203
- Oh, boy.
- I know. I know.

14:26.338 --> 14:27.905
I can't help myself.

14:28.006 --> 14:29.407
Maybe I should just get far, far away

14:29.541 --> 14:30.808
before I do any more damage.

14:30.943 --> 14:32.610
Maybe you should.

14:32.744 --> 14:33.945
Doesn't Sashi have a grandmother

14:34.079 --> 14:36.147
just outside Buenos Aires
who she's never met?

14:36.281 --> 14:38.583
She does, but I can't...

14:38.717 --> 14:40.351
You can. You can.

14:40.485 --> 14:41.686
The schedule is light.

14:41.787 --> 14:43.821
There's plenty of space on Boris' jet.

14:43.956 --> 14:44.855
You said it yourself.

14:44.990 --> 14:46.190
The time away from this whole mess

14:46.325 --> 14:49.260
will be good for everyone involved.

14:49.394 --> 14:51.162
My Skype sessions with Rafa's mother

14:51.263 --> 14:53.631
have been great, and I do want Sashi

14:53.765 --> 14:56.801
to get to know all sides of her family.

14:56.935 --> 14:58.202
You're right. We are in.

14:58.337 --> 14:59.337
- Love it.
- I'm all yours.

14:59.438 --> 15:02.740
Okay, lie down before you change your mind.

15:04.676 --> 15:06.811
Okay, so, Ray, we're gonna
test for shifting dullness

15:06.945 --> 15:10.414
to see if any fluid's built
back up in your abdomen.

15:10.549 --> 15:13.017
Here we go.

15:13.151 --> 15:14.518
[Hollow thudding]

15:14.653 --> 15:17.121
Okay.

15:17.255 --> 15:19.790
Sounds hollow.

15:19.891 --> 15:21.359
- Hollow again.
- Yep.

15:21.493 --> 15:23.527
Good news. No fluid.

15:23.662 --> 15:25.296
Finish the course of antibiotics you're on,

15:25.397 --> 15:27.031
and you should be fine.

15:27.165 --> 15:29.100
See? Like I said. I'm fine.

15:34.006 --> 15:35.439
Okay, so the list of emergency numbers

15:35.574 --> 15:36.574
is next to the phone,

15:36.708 --> 15:38.275
but your first call should probably be to...

15:38.377 --> 15:39.577
Evan.

15:39.711 --> 15:41.379
If I need anything, I
will call Paige and Evan.

15:41.513 --> 15:42.413
That's what I'd do.

15:42.547 --> 15:43.581
- But please...
- Don't worry.

15:43.715 --> 15:45.049
I won't tell them that you said that.

15:45.183 --> 15:48.386
Wow, you really are becoming
a member of our family.

15:50.789 --> 15:52.256
I'm really sorry about that photo of you

15:52.357 --> 15:53.691
on Snarkhampton.

15:53.825 --> 15:56.460
I mean, you were only there
because I called you for help.

15:56.595 --> 15:57.762
Oh, please. Don't feel bad.

15:57.863 --> 15:58.996
That had nothing to do with you.

15:59.131 --> 16:00.564
Look, gossip in the Hamptons

16:00.699 --> 16:02.400
changes faster than the stoplights.

16:02.534 --> 16:04.101
This whole photo thing will blow over soon.

16:04.236 --> 16:07.171
- I promise.
- Now we're screwed.

16:07.272 --> 16:09.006
Cinco's parents are suing Hankmed.

16:09.107 --> 16:10.007
- What?
- Yeah.

16:10.142 --> 16:11.142
You know that picture of you

16:11.276 --> 16:12.376
sticking a needle into Cinco's ass?

16:12.511 --> 16:13.611
They saw that. Now they're out for blood.

16:13.712 --> 16:15.680
That's crazy. Hank saved Cinco.

16:15.814 --> 16:17.181
He was drugged and out of control.

16:17.315 --> 16:18.315
Yeah, I know that, but thanks to Oz,

16:18.450 --> 16:19.650
they think Hank did the drugging.

16:19.785 --> 16:21.152
Well, the really bad news
is now we have to call...

16:21.253 --> 16:22.687
Keller, I know. I already
did. He's already on it.

16:22.821 --> 16:23.788
But what if the rest of the Hamptons

16:23.922 --> 16:25.222
starts taking this Oz guy seriously?

16:25.357 --> 16:26.524
- This has to stop.
- You're right.

16:26.658 --> 16:28.192
You're right. You want me to stick around?

16:28.326 --> 16:29.593
- Postpone Argentina?
- No, no.

16:29.728 --> 16:30.695
You go help Boris.

16:30.829 --> 16:32.263
I'll take care of this sleazebag Oz

16:32.364 --> 16:33.564
and his scum-sucking paparazzi.

16:33.665 --> 16:35.633
They think they can hide
behind a cloak of anonymity?

16:35.767 --> 16:36.701
They can't.

16:36.835 --> 16:38.102
I'm gonna find them and expose them

16:38.203 --> 16:40.337
for the sociopathic cockroaches they are.

16:40.439 --> 16:42.239
Those snarks are about to get harpooned.

16:42.340 --> 16:43.541
- Up high.
- Oh, yeah.

16:43.675 --> 16:45.176
You go, Ev.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.994
How long have you been feeling sick?

16:53.129 --> 16:56.131
Uh, I've had a fever for over a week.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.866
I'm sure it's just the flu.

16:57.967 --> 16:59.334
100.8.

16:59.468 --> 17:00.869
Could be something other than the flu.

17:00.970 --> 17:02.437
Let us get you a blanket, Wendy.

17:02.538 --> 17:04.305
And some tea.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.673
Have you had any weight loss?

17:05.808 --> 17:07.776
A couple of pounds.

17:07.910 --> 17:10.912
I haven't had much of an appetite.

17:11.012 --> 17:12.213
Where are you from originally?

17:12.348 --> 17:13.348
Vietnam.

17:13.482 --> 17:14.782
Have you traveled there recently?

17:14.916 --> 17:16.117
No. Why do you ask?

17:16.252 --> 17:18.953
I'm just ruling out tropical disease.

17:19.088 --> 17:19.954
Open.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.028
I'm gonna draw some blood to send

17:27.128 --> 17:28.563
for some studies including cultures.

17:28.697 --> 17:30.165
You should get plenty of rest and fluids,

17:30.299 --> 17:32.534
and I'll give you some Tylenol
to bring the fever down.

17:32.635 --> 17:33.935
Thank you, Dr. Sacani.

17:34.036 --> 17:36.971
And thank you, Paige and
Russel, for bringing me here.

17:37.106 --> 17:39.808
[Coughing]

17:39.909 --> 17:41.876
- I can catch a cab home.
- No, no, no.

17:42.011 --> 17:43.611
- Russel will take you home.

You poor thing. She's very stoic.

confirm whether or not

27:11.265 --> 27:12.432
It's only the beginning.

28:05.953 --> 28:08.654
Okay, let's show mama.

Oh, that was Rafa's favorite.

28:28.575 --> 28:30.209
- Beginnings of a polo star.
- Yeah.

28:33.180 --> 28:37.483
I lost Rafa's father so early.

28:37.618 --> 28:40.853
I know what it is to raise a child alone.

28:40.988 --> 28:42.188
It's overwhelming.

28:42.289 --> 28:44.857
Even working part-time,
I feel like I'm missing out.

There's no one to back you up.

28:46.226 --> 28:47.727
You're so exhausted.

28:47.828 --> 28:49.896
- You make silly mistakes.
- I know.

28:50.030 --> 28:51.964
Recently I managed to insult a dear friend,

28:52.065 --> 28:53.666
and now, Sashi and I are homeless.

28:53.801 --> 28:55.201
You're homeless?

28:55.335 --> 28:59.038
Well, we are temporarily
at my father's house.

28:59.139 --> 29:01.441
I get so emotional now.

29:01.575 --> 29:03.342
I worry that I'm not
making the right decisions,

29:03.477 --> 29:05.812
that I'm doing it all wrong.

29:05.946 --> 29:06.879

29:11.718 --> 29:15.388
Seriously, Sashi has
relatives on four continents,

29:15.489 --> 29:17.457
and I want her to learn
all her family traditions

29:17.591 --> 29:19.492
and someday choose for herself.

29:19.626 --> 29:22.929
I'll start seducing her

29:23.030 --> 29:25.731
of handmade lace on her
first communion dress.

29:25.866 --> 29:26.966
Good luck.

My mother's competitive,

can turn a girl's head too.

29:31.171 --> 29:32.371
I better get it started.

29:36.543 --> 29:38.611
Yeah, I saw your knees are hurting.

29:38.712 --> 29:40.480
And my doctor's pills do nothing.

29:40.614 --> 29:42.548
But that shouldn't stop me.

29:56.897 --> 30:00.600
Oh, and Ms. Warren, please don't
tell her that I hired you. Thank you.

30:00.734 --> 30:02.835
Hey. I got your call.

30:02.970 --> 30:04.637
Did you get Wendy's other test back?

30:04.771 --> 30:05.872
They were all negative.

30:06.006 --> 30:08.207
And yet Russel says she's worse.

30:08.308 --> 30:09.575
She's getting confused.

30:09.676 --> 30:11.444
Confused? How?

30:11.545 --> 30:13.312
Well, she keeps saying
she has to take the bus

30:13.413 --> 30:14.547
back to Queens.

30:14.681 --> 30:16.115
To Queens?

30:16.216 --> 30:18.284
Doesn't she work at that
estate where I saw her?

30:18.418 --> 30:20.786
No, I think she works at an airport.

30:20.888 --> 30:22.488
At an airport? Doing what?

30:22.589 --> 30:24.023
Something with passenger services.

We have to get over there right away.

30:25.659 --> 30:27.393

- What?

30:27.528 --> 30:29.195
The very first thing I ruled out,

30:29.296 --> 30:31.464
malaria, but from a rare cause.

30:31.598 --> 30:32.965
It's called airport malaria.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.734
You can get malaria in an airport?

30:34.868 --> 30:37.336
Mosquitoes catch planes too.

30:37.471 --> 30:38.938
She started shaking a few minutes ago.

- I didn't know what to do
- [Gasping and wheezing]

30:41.575 --> 30:44.219
- I called 911.
- Can you stop this?

a loading dose of antimalarials

31:24.251 --> 31:25.518
to combat the infection.

31:25.652 --> 31:27.153
The malaria has gone to her brain.

Is that as bad as it sounds?

She's better than great.

31:57.462 --> 32:00.664
I miss her more than I expected.

32:00.765 --> 32:03.100
After I took her to the airport, I was...

It was the first time we've been apart

32:04.702 --> 32:06.136
since we got back together, and I just...

32:06.237 --> 32:07.871
I can't stop thinking about her.

32:07.972 --> 32:09.673
That is how it starts.

32:09.807 --> 32:13.377
Next thing you know, you have a family.

32:17.815 --> 32:20.317
It's been hard for you to
watch Tobias and his son.

32:20.451 --> 32:22.919
After my father died, Hank,

32:23.054 --> 32:26.156
I felt... sealed off

32:26.257 --> 32:28.725
in a world that I do not want for my son.

32:28.860 --> 32:33.764
I want Carlos to enjoy life,

32:33.898 --> 32:35.298
not just endure it.

Well, anything you, Marisa,

So your blood smear confirms malaria.

32:51.549 --> 32:53.617
These blue and violet shaped crescents

32:53.751 --> 32:55.085
are the malaria parasites.

32:55.186 --> 32:56.319
Yuck.

32:56.454 --> 32:58.522
Doesn't malaria mean "bad air"?

32:58.656 --> 33:01.058
- Yes.
- So there's malaria in Queens?

33:01.192 --> 33:02.826
Uh, no.

33:02.960 --> 33:03.960
I'll inform the CDC,

33:04.095 --> 33:05.662
but given the ten-day incubation period

33:05.763 --> 33:07.030
before Wendy's symptoms appeared

33:07.131 --> 33:08.899
and the average lifespan of a mosquito,

33:09.033 --> 33:10.734
I think the culprit is long dead.

33:10.835 --> 33:12.836
You'll need to finish up
your maintenance dose

33:12.937 --> 33:15.072

make a full recovery.

33:15.206 --> 33:17.007

33:35.259 --> 33:37.994
If your company hadn't
misplaced that pretty egg,

Sashi, finding a new home.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.559
It's not easy.

34:14.661 --> 34:18.096
And I was thinking maybe I could help you

34:18.197 --> 34:20.197
by taking care of Sashi.

34:20.333 --> 34:22.833
You are the best, Lorena.

We would love to have
you come to the Hamptons.

34:25.237 --> 34:28.106
No, I meant here in Argentina.

34:28.241 --> 34:30.509
You could leave Sashi with me for a while,

34:30.643 --> 34:32.476
she could get to know her <i> abuela,</i>

34:32.612 --> 34:35.112

He's hoping to come to visit in a few weeks.

34:44.389 --> 34:47.025
He could see his daughter.

34:47.159 --> 34:49.094
Your offer is sweet,

34:49.228 --> 34:51.263
but I think we should
probably stick to our plan.

34:51.397 --> 34:54.032
But you said how overwhelmed you feel.

34:54.167 --> 34:56.234
It may be best for Sashi.

I'll discuss a visitation
schedule with Rafa.

- Hello?
- Hey.

38:30.762 --> 38:32.262
I'll be home as soon as I can.

38:32.364 --> 38:34.064
- Okay. Love you.
- Okay, babe.

38:34.199 --> 38:35.733
[Phone beeps] I worry 'cause I feel like...

38:40.705 --> 38:41.905
[Sighs]

38:42.040 --> 38:43.440
[Cell phone chimes]

38:43.440 --> 38:45.853
__

38:48.913 --> 38:49.813
[Sniffs]

38:49.948 --> 38:52.816
[Cell phone jingling]

38:56.888 --> 38:59.023
Hey.

38:59.124 --> 39:00.891
Why are you calling me?

39:00.992 --> 39:01.959
What?

39:06.598 --> 39:08.532
My mistake.

39:08.633 --> 39:09.867
Okay.

39:16.975 --> 39:19.476
[Sighs]

39:25.717 --> 39:27.317
Ms. Warren.

39:27.452 --> 39:28.685
What happened?

39:28.820 --> 39:31.622
I tripped over the curb in
front of the courthouse.

39:31.756 --> 39:32.923
Knocked myself out.

39:33.024 --> 39:35.426
Luckily, no concussion,
and it's just a sprain.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.661
Oh, you are lucky.

39:37.762 --> 39:40.831
I'm very grateful for your
help with Viviana's case.

39:40.965 --> 39:42.266
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.902
I was on my way in. I never made it.

39:45.036 --> 39:47.871
You were gonna be my next call.

39:47.972 --> 39:49.606
So...

39:49.741 --> 39:51.775
Wait.

39:51.910 --> 39:54.111
If you didn't help Viviana, who did?

39:56.347 --> 39:59.983
But you did get the judge to delay.

40:00.085 --> 40:03.787
And is that enough time to prepare her case?

40:03.922 --> 40:07.391
Thank you so much, and
please send me the bill.

40:12.130 --> 40:14.031
I saw your bags are outside.

40:14.165 --> 40:16.733
Yes. We will miss you.

40:16.868 --> 40:20.571
Sashi, give your <i> abuela</i> a kiss.

40:20.705 --> 40:23.974
Aw. [Cooing]

40:24.109 --> 40:25.609
I was hoping to avoid this.

40:25.743 --> 40:27.411
I'm afraid you can't leave.

40:27.545 --> 40:28.412
What do you mean?

40:28.546 --> 40:29.913
I've talked to Rafa,

40:30.048 --> 40:31.982
and he loved the idea of Sashi staying on

40:32.117 --> 40:34.017
so he can see his little girl here.

40:34.152 --> 40:36.820
I'm sorry. That... it isn't possible.

40:36.955 --> 40:40.224
What's impossible is for a
minor to leave the country

40:40.358 --> 40:42.392
without both parents' permission.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.294
[Crying]

40:44.429 --> 40:46.864
Sashi has an American passport.

40:46.998 --> 40:48.599
And I registered her

40:48.733 --> 40:51.401
for her Argentinean passport today.

40:51.503 --> 40:52.669
You did what?

40:52.804 --> 40:55.873
You said you wanted her
to enjoy her heritage.

40:55.974 --> 40:57.708
I'll call Rafa and clear this up.

40:57.809 --> 41:00.344
Unfortunately, he's on a plane now.

41:00.478 --> 41:01.945
Sashi and I will be too.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.247
I know the system here.

41:03.381 --> 41:06.450
You won't be able to clear customs.

41:06.584 --> 41:08.085
Are you threatening us?

41:08.219 --> 41:09.753
No, of course not.

41:09.854 --> 41:12.723
My son just wants to see his daughter,

41:12.824 --> 41:15.125
and you're welcome to stay too.

41:19.564 --> 41:20.797
[Sighs]

41:25.069 --> 41:26.436
I like 'em.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.305
Mm, the brocade looks heavy.

41:28.439 --> 41:30.641
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, lose the brocade.

41:30.775 --> 41:31.808
[Chuckles]

41:31.943 --> 41:33.377
Those aren't the brocade.

41:33.511 --> 41:35.345
Ah, sorry, boss.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.114
[Both laugh]

41:37.248 --> 41:40.851
You know, I think I want
to try the white set.

41:40.985 --> 41:42.953
- Strip all this?
- Yeah.

41:46.057 --> 41:49.326
[Laughing] Are you kidding?

41:49.460 --> 41:51.895
I am the pillow king of Hackensack.

41:51.996 --> 41:54.631
[Both laughing]

41:57.769 --> 42:00.771
[Tense music]

42:00.905 --> 42:03.340
[Gunshot]

42:03.474 --> 42:05.275
[Gasps]

42:05.410 --> 42:07.644
Co on, meome on, come on. Come on.

42:07.745 --> 42:09.613
No, no, no, don't move. Don't move.

42:09.747 --> 42:11.014
- You've been shot.
- What?

42:11.149 --> 42:13.817
[Panting]

42:13.918 --> 42:15.018
[Gasps]

42:15.153 --> 42:17.120
It's not me. It's you.
