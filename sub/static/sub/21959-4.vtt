WEBVTT

00:06.141 --> 00:07.960
Previously on Bad Blood...

00:08.077 --> 00:11.778
Number one priority,
taking care of my son.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.813
You are my employee.

00:13.882 --> 00:17.085
I pay you to take care of my family.

00:17.110 --> 00:18.781
No more commission.

00:18.992 --> 00:20.491
I just get a straight 10%.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.725
I already have investors.

00:21.794 --> 00:23.539
Not without the permits, you don't.

00:23.547 --> 00:26.291
Some journalists with nothing
better to do for a couple years,

00:26.315 --> 00:27.949
release a bombshell report

00:28.017 --> 00:30.384
saying the entire city's
construction industry

00:30.453 --> 00:33.257
was totally corrupt
and controlled by the mob.

00:33.890 --> 00:36.691
If we find this to be true,
it will stand no more.

00:36.759 --> 00:37.759
Shit!

00:37.826 --> 00:39.159
I need you to call your father.

00:39.184 --> 00:40.283
Then you're gonna say,

00:40.308 --> 00:41.828
"Dad, I hear you got a bad cough."

00:41.988 --> 00:43.320
And then you'll insist

00:43.398 --> 00:45.232
that he goes to see the prison doctor.

00:45.585 --> 00:47.123
Why do you have pictures of my family?

00:47.148 --> 00:48.718
You work at a prison, right?

00:48.804 --> 00:50.704
- To cancer!
- To cancer!

00:50.772 --> 00:52.570
To my son, coming home.

00:52.671 --> 00:55.398
I am Vito, right now!

00:55.445 --> 00:58.813
All we have is our name and
he is using it for himself.

00:58.882 --> 01:00.757
I respect that name more than my own.

01:07.691 --> 01:08.757
When's the funeral?

01:08.825 --> 01:09.825
In three days.

01:09.893 --> 01:11.725
You're not going to let me bury my son?

01:43.593 --> 01:44.914
These are your plants.

01:45.081 --> 01:48.687
I am gonna show you everything
you need to know once.

01:49.331 --> 01:52.062
Every day this summer, you're
gonna take care of this plant,

01:52.367 --> 01:54.820
and for every one that dies
I'm going to punish you.

01:55.304 --> 01:58.205
But for everyone that gives
you big, juicy tomatoes,

01:58.273 --> 01:59.476
I am gonna kiss you.

01:59.741 --> 02:01.385
Now, sometimes you're gonna
do everything right,

02:01.409 --> 02:04.375
exactly the way I say,
and it's still gonna die.

02:05.213 --> 02:06.742
And I'm still gonna punish you.

02:07.015 --> 02:08.615
Now, you may not think that's fair,

02:08.683 --> 02:10.038
but that's why I do it.

02:10.383 --> 02:13.252
It is so that you learn that
someday when you are in charge,

02:13.321 --> 02:14.726
no matter what happens,

02:15.156 --> 02:17.367
there's an accident,
someone makes a mistake,

02:17.546 --> 02:20.210
it is you who must take responsibility.

02:20.728 --> 02:24.468
Your plants, your school,
your family, your business.

02:24.732 --> 02:26.062
It is all yours.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.000
You understand me, Vito?

02:29.170 --> 02:30.436
Yes, Papa.

02:45.864 --> 02:46.864
What's going on?

02:48.188 --> 02:49.609
Man needs time to himself.

02:52.859 --> 02:54.234
Just lost his son.

02:55.718 --> 02:56.851
The funeral's today.

03:52.884 --> 03:53.890
There you are.

03:54.586 --> 03:55.671
I need a break.

03:56.454 --> 03:59.054
There's got to be 150 people out there.

03:59.957 --> 04:01.123
I hate funerals.

04:01.192 --> 04:02.432
I know everyone hates funerals,

04:02.460 --> 04:03.929
but this is totally inappropriate.

04:04.362 --> 04:07.039
I don't want this many people in
my house on a happy occasion.

04:07.332 --> 04:08.831
Just leave these poor people alone.

04:09.078 --> 04:10.078
You know?

04:17.208 --> 04:18.928
Mmm-mmm.

04:20.043 --> 04:21.468
You know the job in Lachute?

04:21.923 --> 04:23.031
Now we have a problem.

04:23.247 --> 04:25.568
It turns out that the two guys...

04:25.593 --> 04:27.023
- Bruno.
- Mmm?

04:27.684 --> 04:29.179
I don't want to talk about work.

04:30.820 --> 04:31.820
It's a funeral.

04:43.186 --> 04:44.466
It's roast beef tonight.

04:48.138 --> 04:49.976
You gotta eat somethin', Mr. Rizzuto.

06:14.254 --> 06:16.020
I have been checking these all night.

06:16.089 --> 06:17.628
Roads repaired in Montreal cost 37%

06:17.640 --> 06:19.324
more than roads repaired in Ontario.

06:19.393 --> 06:22.126
Okay, well, compile a list
of every city engineer,

06:22.195 --> 06:24.137
permit approvals agents,
and city council

06:24.162 --> 06:25.687
person attached to each project.

06:25.732 --> 06:28.210
I guarantee you a pattern will emerge.

06:28.307 --> 06:32.070
Oh, I also want a list of every
company that bid on every job.

06:32.438 --> 06:34.183
I know all the reports
fingered Vito Rizzuto,

06:34.207 --> 06:36.285
but I'm not finding anything
that connects us to him.

06:36.309 --> 06:38.709
On paper, you won't. We'll need
to get testimony for that.

06:38.778 --> 06:40.364
We're just getting into this and

06:40.376 --> 06:41.779
already finding obvious corruption.

06:41.848 --> 06:44.348
How do these things go on for
so long without being noticed?

06:44.417 --> 06:46.245
Payoffs, bribes... These things just

06:46.257 --> 06:48.046
become the way of doing business.

06:48.388 --> 06:52.022
Okay. We're looking for crooks,
so let's start with the crooks.

06:52.091 --> 06:54.057
Guy, I want you to pull up
all records of anyone

06:54.126 --> 06:57.109
arrested for fraud or corruption
over the last 12 years.

06:57.496 --> 06:59.294
Then run those names against all

06:59.319 --> 07:01.601
construction company
owners and employees.

07:01.833 --> 07:03.765
There will be crossover somewhere.

07:04.669 --> 07:06.922
We need to get someone
on record and out in

07:06.923 --> 07:08.906
the press to scare people out of hiding.

07:09.234 --> 07:10.343
Let's shake some bushes.

07:10.368 --> 07:11.657
What was that file you
wanted to show me?

07:11.681 --> 07:12.695
Yeah.

07:21.993 --> 07:22.993
Hmm.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.812
Beautiful.

07:40.506 --> 07:47.070
_

07:47.117 --> 07:50.820
The shot came from this
wooded area shortly before 6:00.

07:50.888 --> 07:54.522
A bullet pierced the solarium,
and then the patio door.

07:54.591 --> 07:56.680
It hit Nicolo Rizzuto as he prepared

07:56.692 --> 07:58.793
dinner with his wife and daughter.

07:59.093 --> 08:02.865
Rizzuto may have been,
at one time, a powerful mob boss,

08:02.933 --> 08:05.734
but he died the head
of a very weakened family.

08:05.802 --> 08:09.437
His grandson gunned down, his son
Vito unable to attend the funeral

08:09.506 --> 08:12.540
as he serves out his sentence
in an American jail.

08:12.609 --> 08:14.776
And today there is not much left

08:14.845 --> 08:17.512
of what was once Canada's
most infamous crime family.

08:28.557 --> 08:30.539
Wow! Papa.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.227
So? It's like we thought.

08:35.498 --> 08:36.498
- Sal.
- Yeah.

08:37.967 --> 08:39.006
Well, who's Sal?

08:39.032 --> 08:41.601
Sal Montagna. Acting head
of the Bonanno family.

08:41.640 --> 08:42.914
And The 'Ndrangheta?

08:43.433 --> 08:45.335
Probably doing Sal's bitchwork.

08:45.621 --> 08:47.546
Wait, wait. Who's this now?

08:47.734 --> 08:50.435
Calabrians out of Toronto. They
wanted our action for years.

08:50.715 --> 08:53.375
Sal Montagna made an alliance
with them to take us out.

08:59.070 --> 09:00.101
Okay.

09:00.546 --> 09:02.213
I've gotta go, gentlemen.

09:02.281 --> 09:03.521
I have got a meeting to attend.

09:03.549 --> 09:05.742
Renata, before you go,
did you read this?

09:05.867 --> 09:07.537
More shit on the corruption report.

09:07.562 --> 09:09.522
Of course she read it.
The whole city's read it.

09:09.547 --> 09:10.649
But did you see what they said about me?

09:10.673 --> 09:11.960
They said I have ties to drugs.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.406
Everybody knows that I hate drugs.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.452
No. This is a blemish on my reputation.

09:15.477 --> 09:16.477
Can I sue them?

09:18.515 --> 09:20.415
No. You can't sue them.

09:26.069 --> 09:27.135
Seriously?

09:28.050 --> 09:29.617
That's what you are thinking about now?

09:30.769 --> 09:31.769
Just asking.

09:38.677 --> 09:40.406
Why did they have to kill him, Declan?

09:42.274 --> 09:43.274
It ain't right.

09:45.470 --> 09:46.470
It's a message.

09:47.728 --> 09:49.359
Rizzuto name is done for now.

09:49.994 --> 09:51.015
Poor Vito.

09:51.108 --> 09:53.015
First his son, now his father.

09:53.819 --> 09:56.312
When you step down, you're off limits.

09:56.932 --> 09:58.710
- That's how it used to be.
- Yeah.

10:01.432 --> 10:02.906
To the old man and Nico.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.890
- Declan.
- What?

10:12.718 --> 10:14.156
Everyone's feeling nervous.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.546
Jacques, Papa Lou, Mick...

10:15.633 --> 10:17.233
Not to mention our friends in city hall.

10:17.269 --> 10:19.769
All these murders and now this garbage.

10:19.838 --> 10:21.270
It's a lot all at once.

10:21.339 --> 10:23.673
I got no time to babysit.
They need to calm down.

10:23.741 --> 10:24.984
That's what I told them.

10:25.009 --> 10:27.129
Vito will be home soon,
he'll take care of everything.

10:27.244 --> 10:28.811
What is wrong with you?

10:28.879 --> 10:30.045
Seriously?

10:30.114 --> 10:31.921
What is wrong with you?

10:32.046 --> 10:33.289
What? Tell me, what?

10:33.382 --> 10:35.343
When you talk like that, Bruno,

10:35.773 --> 10:37.904
you send a message that
we we're like, like,

10:37.929 --> 10:40.523
waiting for Daddy to get
home to fix the sink.

10:41.359 --> 10:44.492
I am in charge to the last day.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.460
Right, you're right. I apologize.

10:49.007 --> 10:50.234
I apologize.

10:54.289 --> 10:55.870
Will it double our payouts?

10:55.939 --> 10:57.539
- To who?
- Everyone.

10:58.429 --> 10:59.601
It'll cost a fortune.

10:59.817 --> 11:03.031
All Sal has to do is get it out
there that he's gonna pay more.

11:03.578 --> 11:05.359
We could lose half the
boots on the ground.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.117
Loyalty is in this room,

11:08.718 --> 11:09.917
and a few others.

11:09.986 --> 11:11.853
Everyone else is bought or scared.

11:12.218 --> 11:13.654
But that's a shitload of money.

11:13.723 --> 11:16.179
- Just do it.
- I'll do it.

11:16.328 --> 11:18.070
Just saying it's a shitload of money.

11:18.337 --> 11:19.337
But I'll do it.

11:38.046 --> 11:39.523
This is a goddamn disaster.

11:40.568 --> 11:42.328
You know what? You reek of panic.

11:44.642 --> 11:45.960
France is relentless.

11:47.023 --> 11:48.721
Okay? She's incorruptible.

11:48.790 --> 11:51.046
If Vito thinks he can buy her, he can't.

11:51.109 --> 11:53.693
Or worse, if he needs
to buy her, he's screwed.

11:53.762 --> 11:54.765
Aucoin.

11:54.997 --> 11:58.031
These things, they take years, okay?

11:58.100 --> 12:00.065
I mean, why are you
so turned out by this?

12:00.134 --> 12:02.201
You got a construction company
I don't know about?

12:02.270 --> 12:03.343
Is that it?

12:03.812 --> 12:05.772
Everything's connected, Declan.

12:05.945 --> 12:06.992
Tell me.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.623
Has there been a construction
project over the last 15 years

12:10.648 --> 12:12.695
you guys haven't been involved in, huh?

12:12.881 --> 12:16.048
All it takes is one guy, just
one guy, in the chain to fold.

12:16.117 --> 12:17.328
I'm gonna take care of it.

12:19.353 --> 12:20.552
Fuck.

12:20.679 --> 12:21.726
Vito.

12:22.623 --> 12:24.924
Can't imagine what he is
going through right now.

12:26.373 --> 12:27.968
Timing couldn't be worse, but...

12:28.851 --> 12:30.960
he has got to take this very seriously.

12:31.103 --> 12:33.402
That bitch is gonna
dig up everything there is.

12:34.970 --> 12:38.246
And know this, Declan, you guys
are gonna take a very serious hit

12:38.271 --> 12:39.671
on your construction rackets.

12:39.740 --> 12:42.507
That well is dry right now, and
that's gonna make you weaker.

12:43.046 --> 12:45.243
Now, whoever it is
who's making a run at you

12:45.312 --> 12:48.632
is gonna know that, and they are
gonna keep coming and coming.

12:51.418 --> 12:54.546
Vito is coming back to a shit storm.
Do you get that?

12:54.975 --> 12:55.975
I do.

12:59.855 --> 13:00.988
Breathe.

13:03.406 --> 13:07.632
You know, this commission
has nothing to do with us

13:07.867 --> 13:09.199
or our businesses.

13:09.632 --> 13:12.035
Okay? So just get that
out of your minds right now.

13:12.104 --> 13:15.140
All your business is our
business, and vice versa.

13:15.734 --> 13:16.841
Vito told us that once.

13:16.909 --> 13:19.265
Mick, they're not looking for us.

13:19.812 --> 13:21.093
They want politicians.

13:22.814 --> 13:24.726
We keep our hands very clean.

13:25.936 --> 13:29.460
Nobody deals directly with me or Vito.

13:31.326 --> 13:32.718
When does Vito get out?

13:33.325 --> 13:34.328
Soon.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.560
And he's gonna want everything
in order when he does.

13:37.629 --> 13:40.617
We were thinking of pulling
back a little. Just to be safe.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.132
No. Everything stays the same.

13:44.531 --> 13:47.756
Since Vito's been gone
and I've been in charge,

13:47.781 --> 13:49.772
have any of you made less money?

13:50.234 --> 13:51.765
Had more problems?

13:51.990 --> 13:54.164
No to all of the above.

13:54.357 --> 13:56.391
Is Vito in charge when he come back?

13:57.548 --> 13:58.714
That's the idea.

13:58.782 --> 14:00.726
We want to see him as soon as possible.

14:00.825 --> 14:03.106
We want to hear it from him
that things are under control.

14:04.722 --> 14:05.722
Mmm-hmm.

14:07.710 --> 14:08.804
We're done.

14:09.174 --> 14:10.473
- Oui.
- Yeah.

14:16.299 --> 14:18.133
Hey, did you get the flowers we sent?

14:19.955 --> 14:21.804
Yeah, we got 'em.

14:37.448 --> 14:38.640
- Boys.
- Hi.

14:40.518 --> 14:41.917
Well, I'm excited.

14:42.726 --> 14:44.757
Vito is coming back today.

14:47.523 --> 14:51.054
So, his plane lands at 3:00, right, Gio?

14:51.957 --> 14:53.250
We don't want to be late.

14:57.106 --> 14:58.106
What's going on?

15:01.884 --> 15:03.483
Vito doesn't want you there.

15:06.929 --> 15:09.468
- What?
- He doesn't wanna see you, Declan.

15:12.088 --> 15:13.220
What are you talking about?

15:13.437 --> 15:15.470
He didn't explain himself to me, Declan.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.798
Okay, well, you should get going.

15:32.289 --> 15:34.974
It's gonna, it's gonna be okay.

15:35.042 --> 15:37.257
Just, you know, give him time.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.467
Inside one of these unmarked cars,

16:02.536 --> 16:05.738
Vito Rizzuto discreetly left
the Colorado prison.

16:05.806 --> 16:10.208
The Mafia kingpin was immediately
transferred back to Canadian soil,

16:10.277 --> 16:13.578
a homeland Rizzuto
may barely recognize.

16:13.647 --> 16:16.080
During the six years
he served in the US

16:16.150 --> 16:19.851
for his role in the murder of three
New York rivals in the '80s,

16:19.919 --> 16:23.087
the criminal empire
he once ruled over in Canada

16:23.157 --> 16:25.222
evaporated in bullets.

16:38.648 --> 16:40.615
- Welcome back, Vito.
- Thank you.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.007
Good to have you back, Mr. Rizzuto.

16:44.076 --> 16:45.218
Thanks, Gio.

16:46.245 --> 16:48.245
Everyone's at the house waiting for you.

16:48.270 --> 16:49.664
I'm not going home.

16:50.304 --> 16:52.312
- Where you going?
- Hotel.

16:53.373 --> 16:55.640
I'll call the house. What would
you like me to tell them?

16:58.241 --> 16:59.241
Nothing.

17:05.397 --> 17:07.757
Vito locked himself away in a hotel.

17:07.882 --> 17:10.400
No one knew where he was,
and how to get a hold of him.

17:10.468 --> 17:11.554
Me included.

17:11.867 --> 17:14.358
He told Bruno and Gio he didn't
even want to hear my name

17:14.444 --> 17:16.218
after what happened my watch.

17:16.652 --> 17:18.569
I was no longer part of the family.

18:00.023 --> 18:01.390
Do you know who I am?

18:02.492 --> 18:03.632
Yes.

18:03.793 --> 18:05.539
I was told you gentlemen are the ones

18:05.551 --> 18:07.260
who wrote about me in the article.

18:07.330 --> 18:10.030
You know, the one about the
city corruption and all that?

18:10.098 --> 18:11.398
I wanna talk to you about it.

18:11.467 --> 18:12.882
Is there somewhere we can go?

18:13.655 --> 18:14.890
How about in that office?

18:15.026 --> 18:16.613
Oh, that's the editor in chief's office.

18:16.638 --> 18:17.638
That's fine with me.

18:19.047 --> 18:21.313
You wrote that I am involved in drugs.

18:21.338 --> 18:25.396
Actually, we wrote that you
work for Vito Rizzuto,

18:25.421 --> 18:28.000
- who is involved in smuggling...
- Don't get smart.

18:28.523 --> 18:30.202
Anybody who reads that in your paper,

18:30.214 --> 18:31.906
to them it means that I sell drugs.

18:32.262 --> 18:33.523
I detest drugs.

18:34.563 --> 18:36.797
Drugs destroy our
neighborhoods, our children.

18:36.959 --> 18:39.726
My friends, my family, people
of respect read your paper,

18:39.794 --> 18:41.531
and now they think this could be true.

18:43.030 --> 18:44.265
Okay, uh...

18:44.632 --> 18:45.810
Is that all you came in to say?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.514
I want you to write that it's not true!

18:47.546 --> 18:49.243
Okay. You want us to
retract what we wrote?

18:49.303 --> 18:50.468
Retract. Exactly.

18:51.093 --> 18:53.840
- The whole story?
- Nah, nah, the rest I don't care about.

18:53.908 --> 18:55.695
Just the part about me and drugs.

18:55.992 --> 18:58.377
That's my reputation, my legacy.

18:58.445 --> 19:00.179
Well, I'll see what I can do.

19:00.412 --> 19:02.562
Um... May I ask you a few questions?

19:03.383 --> 19:04.460
Of course.

19:04.718 --> 19:06.865
The Rizzuto family is widely known

19:06.890 --> 19:09.443
to be the most powerful
Mafia family in the northeast.

19:09.468 --> 19:10.908
See, that's where we have a problem.

19:11.054 --> 19:12.226
You are men of words.

19:12.289 --> 19:13.870
You are professionals
in this department.

19:13.894 --> 19:16.898
The words "widely known" is the problem.

19:17.459 --> 19:18.992
Who widely knows?

19:19.460 --> 19:22.567
Not a court of law,
not a judge or a jury.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.270
Some degenerate who gambled
away his kid's future

19:25.338 --> 19:28.085
told you Vito's a criminal so
that makes it widely known?

19:28.375 --> 19:30.976
The secretary out there
told me you guys are homos.

19:31.273 --> 19:34.054
So now, it's widely known you are homos!

19:34.580 --> 19:35.925
Can I publish that in a newspaper?

19:35.949 --> 19:37.953
No, I am. He's not.

19:38.125 --> 19:40.462
I don't care about that stuff. I
just care about my reputation.

19:40.486 --> 19:42.703
Now, I have another
appointment to go to.

19:42.830 --> 19:44.617
When can I expect that retraction?

19:46.747 --> 19:47.747
Where is he?

19:49.386 --> 19:50.386
I don't know.

19:51.118 --> 19:52.335
Don't give me that shit.

19:53.833 --> 19:54.833
You wanna come in?

20:02.085 --> 20:04.789
- You want a drink?
- No, I wanna know where he is.

20:06.890 --> 20:08.070
I don't know.

20:08.759 --> 20:09.992
Why is he hiding from me?

20:11.515 --> 20:14.585
I'm gonna go to his house if someone
doesn't tell me where he is.

20:15.220 --> 20:16.484
He won't see me.

20:18.128 --> 20:19.128
What do you mean?

20:23.997 --> 20:25.096
He won't see me.

20:26.005 --> 20:28.203
I don't know where he
is, what he's doing.

20:28.634 --> 20:31.101
So, uh, you know, you can
stop calling me now.

20:33.779 --> 20:35.695
Nico was his pride and joy.

20:36.914 --> 20:38.953
And then losing his
father on top of that.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.867
Getting through this
is gonna be hell for him.

20:43.937 --> 20:48.217
Yeah, I'm not really interested in
analyzing Vito's state of mind.

20:48.286 --> 20:51.997
So, uh, you want a drink? Help yourself.

20:52.022 --> 20:53.262
Otherwise, I'll see you around.

20:55.029 --> 20:56.390
Sorry I bothered you.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.119
Hi.

24:30.242 --> 24:31.374
Declan!

24:34.235 --> 24:36.268
How come you never invited
me up here before?

24:36.369 --> 24:37.765
'Cause I don't like you.

24:38.772 --> 24:40.578
This is my alone place, Bruno.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.307
You spend all your time alone.

24:51.510 --> 24:52.742
You look like shit.

24:52.872 --> 24:54.968
- Thanks. So do you.
- Liar.

24:55.693 --> 24:56.693
I look great.

25:00.931 --> 25:02.039
How you been keeping?

25:05.188 --> 25:06.188
Yeah.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.171
I tried talking to him,
but he won't have it.

25:15.133 --> 25:17.600
He barely talks. He's in
a coma half the time.

25:20.498 --> 25:21.498
Want a beer?

25:21.910 --> 25:22.910
Yeah.

25:25.746 --> 25:26.746
How's your family?

25:27.523 --> 25:30.117
Good. Loud. Expensive.

25:30.541 --> 25:31.941
This is a great property.

25:33.075 --> 25:35.343
The house is a piece of
shit, but what a view.

25:36.133 --> 25:38.062
You should build yourself
something nice.

25:38.169 --> 25:40.303
No, I like it just the way it is.

25:40.379 --> 25:43.914
Quiet. Nice. Cheap.

25:50.063 --> 25:52.264
You know, I never thought
it would turn out this way,

25:52.289 --> 25:53.851
but maybe you should be grateful.

25:56.093 --> 25:58.187
It's getting tense out there.

26:02.875 --> 26:04.695
Holy shit!

26:05.467 --> 26:06.679
Holy shit!

26:07.011 --> 26:08.576
- Holy shit!
- Stay down.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.350
Holy shit!

26:22.941 --> 26:24.296
Yeah.

26:26.959 --> 26:28.725
I see you have got new security.

26:30.481 --> 26:31.695
Collins is over there.

26:34.379 --> 26:35.379
No, thanks.

26:46.631 --> 26:47.631
You look good.

26:51.316 --> 26:52.906
I don't want to talk around things.

26:54.905 --> 26:55.971
You failed me.

26:58.030 --> 27:00.187
I know Nico wasn't easy.
He don't listen.

27:02.035 --> 27:03.335
But I left you in charge.

27:04.615 --> 27:06.535
When you're in charge
whatever happens is on you.

27:12.712 --> 27:13.712
So why'd you call me?

27:17.126 --> 27:18.804
They tried to wipe out the family.

27:19.892 --> 27:20.892
Including you.

27:22.605 --> 27:23.605
You're one of us.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.125
Am I?

27:26.874 --> 27:28.608
I never doubted your loyalty.

27:32.542 --> 27:33.687
You're asking me back?

27:37.313 --> 27:38.313
Yeah.

27:39.949 --> 27:40.949
Yes.

27:43.676 --> 27:44.676
Okay.

27:56.265 --> 27:57.265
We got someone.

27:58.367 --> 28:00.267
- Who?
- Hank Fryman.

28:00.336 --> 28:02.736
Him and his father own a major
construction firm in the city.

28:02.771 --> 28:05.507
He was arrested a few years ago
for paying off a union official.

28:07.075 --> 28:08.075
Bring him in.

28:11.435 --> 28:13.275
- You can come in.
- Thank you.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.015
We have it from more than one source

28:16.084 --> 28:19.085
that you have been working
with organized crime for years

28:19.154 --> 28:21.765
and paying off city
officials to get contracts.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.460
I will say that if you testify
to everything that you know,

28:28.485 --> 28:30.195
it may help your other case.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.892
But I can't guarantee that.

28:39.221 --> 28:40.221
Okay.

28:43.134 --> 28:44.195
Okay, what?

28:45.112 --> 28:47.257
I'll tell you everything.

28:49.721 --> 28:51.420
I'm tired of this.

28:52.839 --> 28:54.203
I'm not a criminal.

28:56.139 --> 28:57.179
Go on.

28:58.929 --> 29:01.191
Every single site out there is paying

29:01.203 --> 29:03.476
people off, skimming from the city.

29:04.437 --> 29:06.750
The whole industry is a closed market.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.702
No one, and I mean no one
can do business

29:10.771 --> 29:13.265
unless you pay people
up and down the line.

29:14.390 --> 29:15.556
Talk me through it.

29:18.928 --> 29:21.671
A city contract is announced.

29:22.218 --> 29:25.085
There's only so many firms
that can handle big jobs.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.695
We all took turns winning bids.

29:30.672 --> 29:32.672
So you were in collusion
with the other firms?

29:32.983 --> 29:34.757
100% of the time.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.343
And all those people at city
hall who approved those bids?

29:38.443 --> 29:39.960
They were being paid off, too.

29:41.723 --> 29:45.390
Then you paid 2.5% of the
entire cost to the Mafia.

29:46.642 --> 29:48.492
And city engineers, politicians?

29:48.672 --> 29:49.937
You paid everybody.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.367
Nothing gets approved
unless a payout is made.

29:54.669 --> 29:58.238
And all these people were
introduced to you by the Mafia.

29:59.766 --> 30:02.484
Who are the Mafia people
you paid cash to directly?

30:03.109 --> 30:04.298
They were always different people

30:04.322 --> 30:05.562
and you never knew their names.

30:05.623 --> 30:07.265
Did you ever meet Vito Rizzuto?

30:09.611 --> 30:15.312
Uh, I met a few of his guys at
events, but I never met Vito, no.

30:19.576 --> 30:22.056
The most famous gangster in the
city and no one's ever met him.

30:27.823 --> 30:29.388
- So, you're back?
- Yeah.

30:29.519 --> 30:31.839
Must have been one hell of
an ass kissing session.

30:32.328 --> 30:33.421
Where the hell is he?

30:33.446 --> 30:36.140
He's in Montreal. Where he sleeps
is none of your goddamn business.

30:36.445 --> 30:37.703
Why isn't he here?

30:38.250 --> 30:39.566
Why haven't we heard from him?

30:39.590 --> 30:42.001
When he wants to show his face, Mick,
he'll show his face to you.

30:42.025 --> 30:44.328
My place on the
South Shore was untouchable.

30:44.453 --> 30:46.358
I could have served coke at the bar to

30:46.359 --> 30:48.390
12-year-old girls, and
no one would go near it.

30:48.543 --> 30:51.610
Last night we get raided.
What's going on?

30:51.834 --> 30:53.902
Three of my corners
got busted last week.

30:55.438 --> 30:56.726
Come on, gentlemen.

30:57.531 --> 30:59.033
You've been around long enough to know

30:59.057 --> 31:00.719
that the cops have to
make a show of things

31:00.743 --> 31:02.562
every so often.
That's all it is.

31:02.648 --> 31:04.512
It's circle of life in our jungle.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.015
Everyone is saying he's scared.

31:07.550 --> 31:09.015
I think they might be right.

31:09.515 --> 31:12.019
You keep telling us
Vito's back and in charge.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.153
But, uh...

31:13.222 --> 31:14.851
I don't see no one in charge.

31:15.233 --> 31:17.209
The main reason we joined this syndicate

31:17.234 --> 31:19.406
was because Vito
owned city hall and the cops.

31:19.953 --> 31:21.703
It's not looking like that anymore.

31:22.215 --> 31:23.718
He won't even talk to us.

31:24.171 --> 31:26.300
Instead, he sends Laurel and Hardy.

31:28.101 --> 31:29.602
So, what do we need this for?

31:29.671 --> 31:31.438
That's funny, leprechaun.

31:31.506 --> 31:33.843
You're talking to people, Mick?
Is that what you're doing?

31:33.875 --> 31:35.442
You find a different money train?

31:35.510 --> 31:37.510
You know what? I'll talk
to whoever I goddamn want.

31:37.546 --> 31:39.437
Oh, yeah? Yeah, you go right ahead.

31:40.701 --> 31:41.867
Enough. Enough!

31:42.798 --> 31:44.195
God damn it!

31:45.759 --> 31:47.225
Get that out of your system?

31:48.690 --> 31:50.187
Now, get your shit together.

31:50.906 --> 31:53.492
This is how guys
end up doing 25 to life!

31:55.269 --> 31:57.702
They get angry, and they get sloppy.

32:04.832 --> 32:06.054
Vito is back.

32:06.774 --> 32:09.351
He has weathered storms
much worse than this.

32:10.351 --> 32:12.389
Now, you've all had it
so easy for too long.

32:12.414 --> 32:14.691
You forgot what it's like to get
slapped around a little bit.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.664
Just, just stop your bitching.

32:16.914 --> 32:19.406
Take care of your end.
Vito will call when it's time.

32:21.125 --> 32:22.632
Get 'em out of here.
Get 'em out of here.

32:22.656 --> 32:23.956
Get 'em out of here.

32:26.259 --> 32:28.187
Declan. Declan.

32:29.246 --> 32:30.246
They're right.

32:30.271 --> 32:31.607
I wouldn't say that in front of them,

32:31.631 --> 32:33.328
but you and I have to talk about this.

32:33.353 --> 32:35.144
He's gotta make an appearance.

32:35.168 --> 32:36.567
He's gotta make an appearance.

32:36.636 --> 32:38.390
If I was them I would have already quit.

32:40.906 --> 32:42.671
I mean, he has been back for months.

32:43.102 --> 32:45.734
He hasn't left his hotel. He
hasn't even seen his family.

32:46.359 --> 32:49.593
I don't know... I don't know
if he still has it in him.

32:50.358 --> 32:51.358
I mean...

32:52.085 --> 32:53.751
It might have been too much to bear.

32:53.820 --> 32:55.898
I wouldn't blame him if that were true.

32:57.322 --> 32:58.531
But you and I are here.

32:58.874 --> 33:00.573
We have to think about our survival.

33:00.643 --> 33:02.643
Our livelihood. I have a family.

33:02.668 --> 33:04.914
The perception out there
is that he is weak.

33:05.159 --> 33:08.890
True or not, that perception
invites attack and desertion.

33:08.915 --> 33:10.265
What are you suggesting?

33:10.701 --> 33:13.937
If Sal Montagna takes us
to war, we could lose.

33:13.962 --> 33:15.095
I know.

33:16.318 --> 33:17.437
So?

33:17.961 --> 33:19.671
So, I'm the peacemaker.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.563
That's what I do.

33:25.315 --> 33:26.315
Okay?

33:31.789 --> 33:33.423
Here's Sal Montagna.

33:33.491 --> 33:36.382
Acting boss of the Bonanno crime family.

33:36.761 --> 33:39.062
Sal was the new breed of capo. You know?

33:39.130 --> 33:41.148
The means always justified the ends.

33:41.566 --> 33:44.492
Sal recruited Toto Bianchi
on our side of the border.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.507
He ran the 'Ndrangheta out of Toronto.

33:48.239 --> 33:51.273
Sal, thanks for coming
all the way out here.

33:51.328 --> 33:53.343
Like, I know it's far, but, uh,

33:54.612 --> 33:56.311
if we're gonna do this and make it work,

33:56.380 --> 33:57.562
we gotta be careful, huh?

33:58.002 --> 33:59.234
It's not a problem.

33:59.826 --> 34:01.414
It's good thinking, huh?

34:01.812 --> 34:03.164
It's a problem for me.

34:03.632 --> 34:05.665
I'm not coming back
to this shithole again.

34:05.781 --> 34:07.330
No matter who was in charge,

34:07.357 --> 34:09.039
you had to work with the bikers.

34:09.063 --> 34:11.531
There was just way too many
chapters to work around.

34:11.556 --> 34:14.056
Discretion is important
at this juncture.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.453
For him it is.

34:15.838 --> 34:18.172
Vito will cut your head
off if he finds you.

34:18.241 --> 34:22.320
Vito is not gonna be doing
much of anything pretty soon.

34:24.900 --> 34:27.382
His organization is going to fall apart.

34:28.478 --> 34:31.012
Both of you already think this
is the most likely outcome.

34:32.936 --> 34:34.507
You wanna know how I know that?

34:35.467 --> 34:37.790
Because you guys drove all the
way out here to this shithole

34:37.813 --> 34:39.342
just to hear what I have to say.

34:40.241 --> 34:43.467
I don't want to build condominiums,
and I don't wanna play golf.

34:43.967 --> 34:46.693
We made a $100 million
last year from drugs,

34:46.762 --> 34:48.367
bookmaking and protection.

34:49.098 --> 34:52.032
Together we're gonna
double that when we take over.

34:53.685 --> 34:55.476
I'm not even gonna ask if you're in

34:56.018 --> 34:57.851
because I already know that you are.

35:03.515 --> 35:05.248
Sal Montagna's here in Montreal.

35:07.643 --> 35:10.617
I've been trying to... I've been
trying to arrange a sit-down,

35:10.642 --> 35:12.914
but I can't get an answer
one way or another.

35:13.429 --> 35:15.304
Why do you want a sit-down with him?

35:15.561 --> 35:18.726
To do what we always do.
To come to an understanding.

35:21.780 --> 35:22.780
Vito.

35:25.122 --> 35:26.390
With all due respect,

35:27.118 --> 35:28.687
everyone is nervous.

35:29.507 --> 35:31.182
They know you're back,
but they haven't seen you.

35:31.206 --> 35:33.179
Which is fine. You do
what you need to do.

35:34.842 --> 35:36.734
But we are not at our
strongest right now.

35:36.875 --> 35:38.711
They could get us
on all sides, the street,

35:38.780 --> 35:40.379
the product, even the commission.

35:40.447 --> 35:43.867
They could force somebody to
testify against you, who knows?

35:49.132 --> 35:51.186
I think it would be better to settle

35:51.198 --> 35:53.609
this peacefully, as hard as that may be.

35:53.643 --> 35:56.211
God knows I want to smash
that son of a bitch's head in,

35:56.256 --> 35:58.773
but the Bonanno's have money,
they have influence.

35:59.647 --> 36:01.980
We could lose this war. If we
do, we'll lose everything.

36:04.633 --> 36:06.198
Find out where he is.

36:06.517 --> 36:07.549
Sure.

36:10.306 --> 36:11.429
Thank you.

36:12.117 --> 36:14.101
- Declan, talk to you later.
- All right.

36:20.068 --> 36:21.133
What are you thinking?

36:24.924 --> 36:27.289
I think we need to keep an eye on Bruno.

36:29.606 --> 36:31.929
But I don't think that
he's entirely wrong.

36:34.541 --> 36:35.607
What do you think?

36:37.021 --> 36:38.049
I think...

36:38.984 --> 36:41.156
the time for diplomacy is over.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.106
No more partnerships.

36:43.174 --> 36:44.500
No more handshakes.

36:45.834 --> 36:48.226
I think Sal killed your son...

36:48.951 --> 36:49.984
and Papa,

36:51.362 --> 36:53.273
and should have his eyes cut out.

36:54.892 --> 37:00.507
But I also think it takes a conspiracy
to assassinate a president.

37:02.117 --> 37:05.060
I think we should take out
every piece of shit

37:05.129 --> 37:06.523
that helped Sal.

37:07.335 --> 37:09.898
We should take out
every other piece of shit

37:10.242 --> 37:12.804
that thought about
screwing us in any way.

37:13.889 --> 37:18.046
I think we clear out anyone
we can't see that is with us.

37:19.997 --> 37:23.065
I think we should clear
the whole goddamn board.

37:24.614 --> 37:25.687
Kill 'em all.

37:27.304 --> 37:28.593
No one left but us.

37:32.330 --> 37:33.343
Hmm.

37:44.203 --> 37:45.210
Hi Juan

37:45.235 --> 37:47.914
Won't be two minutes between
the antipasto and entree.

37:47.922 --> 37:49.257
Keep a timer in the kitchen.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.823
I've done this many times before

37:50.892 --> 37:53.269
and I know that is the perfect
interval for a dinner party.

37:53.294 --> 37:54.578
Now, for the wine.

37:54.603 --> 37:56.762
Please, don't let these
heathens order off the menu.

37:56.831 --> 37:58.931
Just keep bringing out
the wine that I chose.

37:58.956 --> 38:00.578
I could give half these guys Manishewitz

38:00.602 --> 38:01.779
and they wouldn't know the difference,

38:01.803 --> 38:03.080
but they'll order the most expensive one

38:03.104 --> 38:04.289
because they're not paying!

38:04.314 --> 38:05.314
Now, dessert.

38:05.398 --> 38:07.606
Tiramisu first, then espresso,

38:07.674 --> 38:08.907
and then the cake.

38:08.976 --> 38:10.867
But no candles. They know how old I am.

38:14.348 --> 38:15.789
Why are we stopping here?

38:16.328 --> 38:17.554
I wanna go for a walk.

38:17.859 --> 38:19.625
- Jesus.
- Come on, it's a nice night.

38:20.787 --> 38:21.890
It's fresh.

38:22.468 --> 38:23.884
Mr. Rizzuto, where you been?

38:23.908 --> 38:25.054
I'm here now.

38:25.507 --> 38:27.226
How does it feel to be out of jail, huh?

38:27.251 --> 38:28.960
- What do you think?
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:29.029 --> 38:30.561
How'd they know we were coming here?

38:30.631 --> 38:32.163
- Vito? Jesus.
- Relax, relax.

38:32.232 --> 38:34.265
Right then at that moment, I got it.

38:34.382 --> 38:36.034
Vito had tipped them off.

38:36.103 --> 38:37.593
He was making an entrance.

38:37.618 --> 38:40.765
He was letting everyone know, in
the most public and cocky way,

38:40.976 --> 38:42.031
he was back.

38:45.578 --> 38:47.383
Vito, I'm honored
you'd come to my birthday.

38:47.407 --> 38:50.258
Oh, are you kidding? You are
one of my oldest friends.

38:50.283 --> 38:51.921
- I wouldn't have missed it.
- Thank you.

38:56.889 --> 38:58.122
One, two, three, four...

39:11.816 --> 39:13.820
- Wow, this a good cigar.
- Yeah.

39:14.404 --> 39:15.757
Oh, I almost forgot.

39:16.234 --> 39:17.840
Gio, you got the present?

39:17.909 --> 39:19.164
Yeah, it's right here.

39:19.203 --> 39:21.278
Oh, Vito, please, you've
already done too much.

39:21.346 --> 39:23.648
Oh, come on, come on. It's nothing.

39:24.049 --> 39:25.250
It's your birthday.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.340
That's for when you're
sitting on the porch...

39:40.364 --> 39:41.530
It's beautiful, thank you.

39:41.599 --> 39:43.900
- ...smoking a cigar, yes.
- Thank you.

39:45.374 --> 39:48.039
Sit down, sit down. It's all right.
Don't thank me.

39:50.132 --> 39:51.285
Do you remember when every house

39:51.309 --> 39:53.476
- in the neighborhood had one of them?
- Yeah.

39:53.501 --> 39:54.687
Big black ones.

39:54.867 --> 39:58.180
They had their own stands.
They had ashtrays everywhere

39:58.205 --> 39:59.548
'cause everyone smoked.

39:59.617 --> 40:00.632
Yeah.

40:00.812 --> 40:04.359
It's funny when one thing changes,
all these other things change.

40:05.952 --> 40:06.985
You know?

40:08.616 --> 40:12.148
When Nico and Pop were taken from me,

40:13.657 --> 40:15.718
it changed how I saw things.

40:17.707 --> 40:19.460
It changed how people saw me.

40:21.166 --> 40:22.166
I don't know.

40:23.340 --> 40:26.195
I don't know. Before it was always

40:26.909 --> 40:29.562
too many things
to worry about, you know?

40:30.636 --> 40:34.671
What would happen if I did A and
B and C, what would that affect?

40:34.817 --> 40:36.577
And what would it affect
if I didn't do them.

40:36.837 --> 40:37.837
Mmm?

40:38.394 --> 40:39.585
I can't do that anymore.

40:39.610 --> 40:43.671
Now... I can see only what I see.

40:44.944 --> 40:45.944
Hmm?

40:47.363 --> 40:52.148
Declan... Declan, he let me
down, but, you know...

40:53.636 --> 40:55.335
I can see that he's with me.

40:55.404 --> 40:56.867
- Yeah.
- You know?

40:57.312 --> 41:01.242
And Gio, always,
I can see that he's with me.

41:02.087 --> 41:03.087
Yeah.

41:05.456 --> 41:06.640
But you, Bruno,

41:08.472 --> 41:09.905
I can't always see you.

41:11.763 --> 41:13.585
Huh? What do you mean?

41:14.589 --> 41:16.856
Of course I'm on your side.
I'm on your side.

41:16.925 --> 41:18.484
No, no, Bruno.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.294
You're a peacemaker.

41:22.723 --> 41:23.906
You sit on the fence.

41:24.688 --> 41:26.664
You take care of your own interests.

41:27.919 --> 41:28.951
You know?

41:30.654 --> 41:32.531
You're not sure if I've got it anymore,

41:32.748 --> 41:34.734
so you gotta protect your survival.

41:35.104 --> 41:36.398
Your livelihood.

41:37.679 --> 41:39.171
Vito, please, I...

41:43.474 --> 41:44.679
Happy birthday.

41:48.870 --> 41:49.882
Gio...

41:50.715 --> 41:51.867
finish him off.

43:19.910 --> 43:21.242
Next time on Bad Blood...

43:21.311 --> 43:22.778
I got another one.

43:22.846 --> 43:25.078
That's four shipments now
in the past two weeks.

43:25.147 --> 43:27.125
I just don't know how they're
getting our drop points.

43:27.149 --> 43:29.476
It's not how, it's who.

43:29.501 --> 43:31.842
Chief of police is on
my ass about all those

43:31.867 --> 43:34.098
goddamn bodies you guys are piling up,

43:34.123 --> 43:35.756
that bitch wants all our wiretaps,

43:35.825 --> 43:37.202
you're gonna talk to me about chocolate?

43:37.226 --> 43:38.904
But seriously, try one.
I want know what you think.

43:38.928 --> 43:40.138
Vito is not himself these days,

43:40.162 --> 43:42.495
and that's what
makes his friends nervous.

43:42.564 --> 43:45.015
I say from now on, only you me and Gio

43:45.040 --> 43:46.179
know the drop-off points.

43:46.204 --> 43:48.882
You cannot treat me like garbage

43:48.907 --> 43:50.674
because you feel like shit.
