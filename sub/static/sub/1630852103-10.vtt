Ready?

09:55.678 --> 09:57.638
That is just the worst thing in the world.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.806
It's not that bad.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.391
Really.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.435
So what is Jason's party for?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.854
I don't know.
He said it's a big cocktail party.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.981
-Everybody's coming.
-It's like a party party?

10:07.064 --> 10:09.150
It's a party party,
so we gotta get glammed.

10:09.233 --> 10:13.321
Do you think Christine's gonna be there?
You guys have been going through a lot.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.780
-I hope she's there.
-Right.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.199
She should be.
She's part of the Oppenheim Group.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.744
-Of course.
-But she hasn't been around anybody.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.537
So it'll probably be uncomfortable

10:21.621 --> 10:26.584
because so much drama has been happening
with Emma and Mary and Chrishell and me.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.420
Right now,
the only way I would talk to her

10:29.503 --> 10:32.423
is if all the girls were there
because too much is being said.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.550
-Yeah.
-I'm not believing what she's saying.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.303
And I don't wanna not believe her.
I wanna know the truth.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.056
[Heather] I struggle
with my issues with Christine

10:40.139 --> 10:44.769
because she said some shitty things
about my past life with an ex-boyfriend,

10:44.852 --> 10:46.646
and I felt uncomfortable,

10:46.729 --> 10:49.732
but Tarek and I talk about everything.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.819
So I'm going to go to my future husband
and talk to him about issues I'm having,

10:53.903 --> 10:55.988
because I respect
everything he has to say.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.574
I also don't want my friends
to feel uncomfortable.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.202
Christine is trying to lie
about all these things,

11:01.285 --> 11:05.039
and why is she still bringing things up
years and years later?

11:05.122 --> 11:06.374
Enough is enough.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.750
She's scrambling right now.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.670
Do you think she's sad
to be losing friends like this?

11:10.753 --> 11:14.215
-Like Mary, me, like--
-No. She's sad to look bad, I think.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.593
That's what she's worried about.
So here's the problem.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.136
Even if you do talk to her,

11:19.220 --> 11:22.181
you're still not gonna know
if she's telling the truth or not.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.559
And the only way
to really know if she is, is time.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.021
Or to get all the girls together
and all talk about it together.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.898
That's the best way to hash it out.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.317
Regardless of all the things
that were said,

11:33.401 --> 11:35.277

15:26.425 --> 15:29.637
she will tell a new version
of what happened,

15:29.720 --> 15:33.057

someone there that can say,

15:33.140 --> 15:35.351

-Yeah.

-But that's all that happened.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.759
[Maya] You guys talk about that.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.719
Christine, you wanted to talk to me?

27:59.803 --> 28:01.930
I was saying if you guys wanna talk to me,

28:02.013 --> 28:04.641
I would love to talk to you,
like, individually.

28:04.724 --> 28:05.558
Why?

28:06.726 --> 28:08.311
Everybody knows everything.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.105

28:11.523 --> 28:14.984

and done things to each person.

-Then you come up with a story with them…

28:19.948 --> 28:22.575
-I did not come up with a story.
-…and then you lie.

28:22.659 --> 28:25.912
If you wanna talk to someone,
then talk to all of us,

28:27.080 --> 28:30.750
because it's happened to all of us,
and I'm over it.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.336
Honestly, my baby's, like,
at home sick right now,

28:33.420 --> 28:35.547
and I'm here for this. Like, why? [sobs]

28:35.630 --> 28:36.798
You guys are monsters.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.050
Okay, so you're… Okay.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.637
I'm happily married, I have a baby,

28:42.721 --> 28:44.806
and I would just like to move on.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.683
We're monsters?

28:46.766 --> 28:48.643
-[Christine] You wanna go?
-If you'd like to.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.437
Don't leave. You've only been here a bit.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.440
You know they're horrible to me.
Why are they acting this way?

28:53.523 --> 28:54.566
They're jealous.

28:54.649 --> 28:58.153
She's like two different people.
Like, when she is on one,

28:58.945 --> 29:02.824
she'll literally, like,
try to ruin your life.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.909
And then all of a sudden, she's like…

29:04.993 --> 29:07.704
When everyone's like,
"Okay, say what you need to say,"

29:07.787 --> 29:08.830
she's like that.

29:08.913 --> 29:13.626
Vanessa, I mean, I came over, I tried.
I don't know what else to do.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.296
-I wanted to leave it--
-[Maya] She felt attacked.

29:16.379 --> 29:19.257
Heather said, "We all need
to talk to you." She felt pressure.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.801
[Davina] She was like,
"Everyone has a different story."

29:21.885 --> 29:24.888
-She'd rather talk individually--
-Exactly, because then…

29:25.555 --> 29:28.808
We can't call her on her shit
when she talks to us individually.

29:29.309 --> 29:33.646
I'm not going to defend someone
if I don't believe in defending them,

29:33.730 --> 29:36.191
so I'm going
to defend Christine to an extent,

29:36.274 --> 29:39.402
but when there are things
that are beyond my knowledge

29:39.486 --> 29:42.614
that I can't speak to,
there's just nothing I can say.

29:42.697 --> 29:45.742
It's never going to end.
It's never going to end.

29:45.825 --> 29:46.910
It's getting worse.

29:46.993 --> 29:49.621
You don't think you've done
anything to upset them?

29:49.704 --> 29:50.997
We have all done things--

29:51.080 --> 29:53.166
[Jason] You haven't done
more than they have?

29:53.249 --> 29:56.753
It's not about who's done more.
That's not what it's about.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.298
-We've all done what?
-[Brett] Hold on.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.634
-I'm not talking about you.
-Everybody's done things.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.386
But nobody's done something
on the level she's done…

30:05.470 --> 30:07.514
-[Christine] She's so nasty.
-…to me.

30:07.597 --> 30:08.556
I know.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.351
See, she can't even talk
about what she did to me.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.686
-It's so disgusting.
-What do you want her to say?

30:15.647 --> 30:17.690
-What do you expect her to say?
-"I'm sorry"?

30:17.774 --> 30:20.819
"I fucking tried to ruin your life"?

30:21.528 --> 30:23.404
"I apologize"?

30:24.572 --> 30:26.658
I… Anything really!

30:26.741 --> 30:30.829
Nobody has ever done anything
like she has on the level that she has.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.289
Nobody.
I have never tried to take her down.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.042
-I understand what you're saying.
-I have never…

30:36.125 --> 30:39.629
tried to plant rumors
that would ruin her life.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.089
I would never do that.

30:41.172 --> 30:44.217
-I will never forgive her--
-That's my point.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.554
But I would appreciate
and respect her owning it.

30:47.637 --> 30:51.975
Christine definitely tried
to spread rumors and lies,

30:52.559 --> 30:54.853
the likes of which would ruin someone.

30:55.436 --> 31:00.275
And so to me, that's so far beyond
"I hate your dress," "You're a bitch."

31:00.358 --> 31:04.320
That just crosses a boundary
that there really is no coming back from.

31:04.404 --> 31:07.490
I just wanna make sure Mary's okay.
Does anyone have eyes on Mary?

31:07.574 --> 31:09.951
No, I don't see anybody.
Do you see anybody?

31:10.034 --> 31:12.078
[Chrishell] Are you good
to do it on your own?

31:12.161 --> 31:15.123

31:15.206 --> 31:16.666

31:16.749 --> 31:18.585

31:21.921 --> 31:23.172

-You're welcome.

Okay.

[Mary exhales heavily]

31:26.342 --> 31:27.176
Christine.

31:27.802 --> 31:31.598
I will talk to you one-on-one
if you wanna talk one-on-one.

31:31.681 --> 31:34.517
-[Davina] You guys got this.
-[Maya] I'm gonna give you guys space.

31:35.310 --> 31:39.397
This is like… I'm only at where I'm at
because we were so close,

31:39.480 --> 31:43.234
and I loved you so much,
and I kept holding onto it.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.861
It was a tornado in my head,

31:44.944 --> 31:49.699
like, where I was just up and down,
crying and angry and crying again.

31:49.782 --> 31:52.869
-I don't want you feeling that way.
-I'm like, "Why?" And I don't…

31:52.952 --> 31:55.079
No. I don't… Christine, listen.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.539
All you have to do…

31:56.623 --> 31:59.417
And I'm at this point because,
for my own sanity,

31:59.500 --> 32:01.085
I can't do it any longer.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.964
And so I've had to just draw a line
and I told you everything,

32:05.048 --> 32:06.549
why I'm at where I'm at,

32:06.633 --> 32:09.385
and if you stop doing crazy shit

32:09.469 --> 32:12.180
and apologize to all the people
I love and care about…

32:12.263 --> 32:14.349
Like, there's a whole group of us.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.602
We're all hurt. We're all confused.
We all don't want the drama.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.729
And there's one common denominator.

32:20.396 --> 32:22.273
I don't want to talk about this stuff.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.443
Honestly, you should
want to talk about it,

32:25.526 --> 32:26.861
because it's so messed up.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.616
Why do you think, like, the entire office
doesn't want to be around you?

32:31.699 --> 32:35.912
'Cause you've done things to everybody!
And I'm just being completely honest.

32:35.995 --> 32:39.082
All you have to do is be genuine,

32:39.165 --> 32:41.542
actually genuine, and apologize,

32:41.626 --> 32:43.503
and not do this shit anymore.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.254
You can't say, "I'm done now."

32:45.338 --> 32:49.175
"Okay, yeah, I have done this
to all these people, but I'm over it now."

32:49.258 --> 32:51.219
-Mary.
-Guess what? Other people aren't.

32:54.555 --> 32:56.891
