WEBVTT

00:11.278 --> 00:13.914
Did you think
that I wouldn't
find out about this?

00:13.914 --> 00:15.482
Dr. Roga,
what a nice surprise.

00:15.482 --> 00:18.518
What can I help you with?
Zeta Interacting Protein.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.921
The drug we designed
to help people with PTSD

00:20.921 --> 00:22.589
selectively erase memories?

00:22.589 --> 00:25.158
When Dale and I learned
it was fatal,

00:25.158 --> 00:28.128
it should've been destroyed,
but these documents show

00:28.128 --> 00:31.031
that sales were made
after the disposal date.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.301
If ZIP is out there
killing people,
it's on us.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.936
Where did you get these?

00:35.936 --> 00:38.405
You assured us
that you would do
the right thing.

00:38.405 --> 00:42.876
Dr. Roga, those responsible
for the unauthorized sale

00:42.876 --> 00:45.979
of our remaining ZIP samples--
a blatantly criminal act--

00:45.979 --> 00:49.383
have been dealt with
to the fullest extent
of the law.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.985
Did we keep it quiet?
Yes.

00:51.985 --> 00:55.355
And our lawyers
more than earned their money
to keep it that way.

00:55.355 --> 00:57.925
But I can assure
that all of this is
very much in the past.

00:57.925 --> 01:00.527
So, while I appreciate
your taking the initiative,

01:00.527 --> 01:02.696
you really have nothing further
to worry about.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.832
Well, I better not,
because if I find
anything else--

01:05.832 --> 01:07.568
You won't.
We narrowly escaped

01:07.568 --> 01:09.770
a potentially calamitous
situation before,

01:09.770 --> 01:12.739
and we won't put ourselves
in that kind of jeopardy again.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.542
And I'm glad
you had the courage
to bring this to me.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.178
This company needs
more people like you.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.013
Drive and integrity

01:20.013 --> 01:22.182
will get you pretty far
around here.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.285
Was there anything else?

01:25.285 --> 01:27.187
No.
Good.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.222
Well...
(clears throat)

01:29.222 --> 01:30.457
If you don't mind,
I...

01:32.059 --> 01:34.127
Thank you.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.763
(door closes)

01:36.763 --> 01:39.466
(phone ringing)

01:42.769 --> 01:44.237
Roga knows.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.573
I don't know.

01:46.573 --> 01:48.942
But it's time
to take care of her.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.344
And her assistant.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.112
(siren wailing in distance)

01:52.112 --> 01:54.247
(ball thudding)

01:59.853 --> 02:01.088
There you are.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.056
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

02:03.056 --> 02:06.493
(wincing)

02:07.928 --> 02:09.196
Ugh...

02:09.196 --> 02:10.864
You okay?
(sighs)

02:10.864 --> 02:12.499
It's-It's these headaches.

02:12.499 --> 02:16.703
I'm just...
hiding out, I guess.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.906
Go home.
You don't have to be here.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.142
After everything
you've been through--
No, I do.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.679
If only to apologize
for what I did.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.582
What Remi did,
you mean.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.517
Remi's gone.

02:30.517 --> 02:33.320
Except that I have all
of her memories now.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.923
And-And more
all of the time.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.493
It's-It's like I woke up
from this nightmare

02:39.493 --> 02:43.397
where I watched myself
do terrible things
to the people I love.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.333
Except it wasn't a nightmare.
It really happened.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.770
Rich and Patterson, I mean,
they welcomed you back
with open arms.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.607
Zapata just got perp-walked
through the FBI in shackles.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.343
She used to be as much a part
of this team as I am.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.379
Why should I get
special treatment?
You don't.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.815
She chose her own path.

03:01.815 --> 03:02.883
You didn't.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.818
(cell phone buzzing)

03:08.422 --> 03:12.059
It's Patterson.
Your results are in.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.161
(Reade)
Hey, I got your text.
What's the verdict on Jane?

03:14.161 --> 03:15.796
Well, we can't just break
the sacred bond

03:15.796 --> 03:17.731
of doctor-patient
confidentiality.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.400
You're not a doctor.
Please don't tell my mother.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.169
(Patterson)
We're gonna wait
for Jane and Weller.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.570
How's it going
with Zapata?

03:23.570 --> 03:26.206
Still not saying a word.
Sounds like her.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.574
How are you doing
with everything?

03:27.574 --> 03:28.842
We'll get to
the bottom of it.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.177
That's not what I meant.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.645
I know.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.214
Hey.
What do you got?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.483
Well, it's conclusive.

03:36.483 --> 03:40.153
Your N-CRIPT procedure
was a success.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.955
You're 100% you.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.323
Science is real!

03:43.323 --> 03:46.760
But as we suspected,
in addition to having

03:46.760 --> 03:48.528
all of your own memories
back again,

03:48.528 --> 03:51.231
you'll also be living
with Remi's memories too.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.300
Her "Remories,"
if you will.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.634
It'll take some
getting used to.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.002
We're just glad
to have you back.

03:56.002 --> 04:00.340
Thank you, all of you,
for-for everything.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.275
Look, I-I just want to--

04:02.275 --> 04:03.810
I want to say I-I'm--

04:03.810 --> 04:06.146
I'm so sorry
for everything I did.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.481
You weren't you.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.249
Yeah, think of Remi

04:09.249 --> 04:10.784
as a symptom
of your illness,

04:10.784 --> 04:14.321
like a skin rash
or... traveler's diarrhea.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.556
(Reade)
Rich.
What?

04:16.556 --> 04:18.758
Won't Weitz demand
accountability for what I did?

04:18.758 --> 04:21.194
Well, he'll be happy
once I show him these results.

04:21.194 --> 04:24.097
He really just wants
to wash his hands of this
and move on.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.300
(sighs)
Well, I should get back.
See if I can get Zapata to talk.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.402
(Reade)
Uh, thanks for the update.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.705
We should get going too.
Yeah.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.082
Hey.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.017
Wait. Sorry.

04:44.017 --> 04:47.087
We do need to talk about
the elephant in the room.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.588
The N-CRIPT procedure

04:48.588 --> 04:50.857
brought your memories
and personality back, but--

04:50.857 --> 04:53.126
The ZIP in my system
is still killing me.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.962
I'm not sure Roman found
anything but dead-ends.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.465
The last time we were together,
he was looking into the work

04:58.465 --> 05:01.368
of this person
named... Kallisto.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.106
Maybe it's nothing,
but Shepherd told me about

05:06.106 --> 05:09.609
a scientist named Kallisto
that Roman was looking into.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.378
It's not much,
but it might help.

05:11.378 --> 05:14.014
Yeah, we'll look into it.
Thanks.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.752
(Reade)
Lying to the FBI and the CIA.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.354
Sabotaging an active
investigation.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.089
Aiding and abetting
a suspected felon

05:23.089 --> 05:25.692
in her operations of a known
criminal organization.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.028
Home invasion.
My home, by the way.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.997
Assaulting an officer
of the law in said home.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.532
Stealing official documents.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.100
Am I forgetting anything?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.572
Look, we both know
how this goes.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.575
I come in hot.
You stonewall.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.376
I empathize a little bit.
Offer you something.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.512
You counter,
maybe let too much slip,

05:45.512 --> 05:47.714
and we're off
to the races.

05:47.714 --> 05:50.517
But you have absolutely
no room to maneuver here,

05:50.517 --> 05:53.486
and eventually I get
what I want.

05:53.486 --> 05:57.057
So why don't we just cut
to the part where you
tell me everything?

06:00.093 --> 06:02.596
All right, well,
I got a stack of paperwork

06:02.596 --> 06:05.565
to get to,
so I'll see you
in a few hours.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.667
I want to talk to Keaton.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.073
I thought he fired you.
You saying he didn't?

06:14.841 --> 06:16.543
If you think somehow
he's your ticket
out of this,

06:16.543 --> 06:18.144
I'm sorry to tell you,
but you're wrong.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.446
Why?

06:19.446 --> 06:21.114
He's in a coma.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.886
(scoffs)

06:26.886 --> 06:29.889
You're lying.
I want to speak to him.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.025
Believe what you want.
He's not coming.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.527
You want to talk
to somebody, talk to me.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.430
Or you could sit here
and say nothing.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.965
That's fine.
I got all day.

06:38.965 --> 06:41.768
Where I'd Del Toro?
In Toronto.

06:41.768 --> 06:44.838
I'll set up a meeting.
Friday, 6:00 a.m.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.806
Don't be late.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.608
Me too.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.519
So, in order to save
Jane's life,

06:59.519 --> 07:00.687
we have to solve "Kallisto."

07:00.687 --> 07:03.556
Okay, Kallisto.
Uh, moon of Jupiter?

07:03.556 --> 07:04.958
Boring!
I'm bored.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.227
The real action is
in Greek mythology

07:07.227 --> 07:09.229
where she appears to be
quite the little nymph.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.731
It's a term meaning
"nature spirit," okay?

07:11.731 --> 07:13.099
Get your mind out
of the gutter.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.868
Okay, here she is
with Jupiter,

07:14.868 --> 07:16.336
who is disguised
as Diana.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.071
Not cool, Jupiter.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.875
The gods transformed Kallisto
into a bear,

07:21.875 --> 07:24.077
which is totally normal.
Yeah.

07:24.077 --> 07:27.647
And then, just before
she was about to be killed,

07:27.647 --> 07:29.549
she was placed
into the heavens by Zeus,

07:29.549 --> 07:32.686
and then turned
into the constellation
Ursa Major.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.554
Hmm, I love a good
deus ex machina.

07:34.554 --> 07:36.356
Wait a second.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.525
Bring up Roman's
data cache.

07:38.525 --> 07:41.161
Okay, uh, Ursa Major.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.662
Grizzly.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.565
"Bear" with me.
I think we got a match.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.435
Okay, let's try...
"Callisto."

07:48.435 --> 07:50.370
Ugh.
"Paws."

07:50.370 --> 07:51.971
Huh?
Bear, again.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.408
Uh, try it with a "K."
It's more exotic.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.877
"Kallisto."

07:57.877 --> 08:00.013
Hey!
Hey!

08:00.013 --> 08:01.414
(both groaning)

08:01.414 --> 08:03.717
Okay, well, Kallisto's
gotta be a pretty big part

08:03.717 --> 08:06.286
of Roman's plan
if it's in the data cache.

08:06.286 --> 08:09.456
A big part
of Ursa Major...

08:09.456 --> 08:11.524
is the Big Dipper.

08:11.524 --> 08:14.194
That's a bit
of a reach, but...

08:14.194 --> 08:15.328
Ugh!

08:15.328 --> 08:16.930
Roman used a more obscure
spelling of Kallisto.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.366
Maybe he used a more obscure
name for the Big Dipper.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.700
Shove a bum, chum.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.035
Ergo...
What?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.937
The plough?
Who even calls it that?

08:23.937 --> 08:26.172
British people.
They got different names
for everything.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.607
Chips? Crisps?

08:27.607 --> 08:29.642
Who knows what the hell
they're talking about?

08:29.642 --> 08:31.578
Ha! Ha ha!
Hey!

08:31.578 --> 08:33.380
Okay.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.148
Dr. Nora Lee Roga.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.183
Let's see if you
can save Jane's life.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.885
(computer beeping)

08:40.954 --> 08:43.757
Oh, no.
This is so not good.

08:45.925 --> 08:48.528
Okay, so we've got good news
and terrible news

08:48.528 --> 08:50.230
that makes
the good news moot.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.598
What is it?

08:51.598 --> 08:53.800
Roman identified
Dr. Nora Lee Roga,

08:53.800 --> 08:57.003
the creator of ZIP,
as the sole key to a cure.

08:57.003 --> 09:01.741
The terrible news?
It is...

09:01.741 --> 09:03.910
She died two years ago.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.214
Taking Jane's cure with her.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.433
(Rich)
Okay, so the only doctor
that could possibly cure Jane

09:26.433 --> 09:28.067
is dead.
Now what?
What do we know about her?

09:28.067 --> 09:31.037
56, deeply respected
in her field,

09:31.037 --> 09:33.740
employed for 11 years
at Kearns Pharmaceuticals,

09:33.740 --> 09:36.309
died in a car crash
two years ago, has a son.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.111
(Rich)
Looks like science runs
in the family.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.580
Clay Roga is
an adjunct biology professor

09:40.580 --> 09:42.215
at New York Metro University.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.050
In fact, he lived
in his mother's basement

09:44.050 --> 09:45.318
while he got
his advanced degree.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.786
Millennials,
am I right?

09:46.786 --> 09:48.421
Clay might know something
about his mom's work.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.224
I'll reach out to him,
see what he can tell us.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.126
And I'll send someone over
to Kearns Pharmaceuticals,

09:53.126 --> 09:55.695
see what the doctor
was up to before she died.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.064
Okay, we'll keep digging
into this file.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.804
Officer Larren,
how can I help you?

10:04.804 --> 10:06.473
Oh, I think you have
something of mine.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.442
What, I steal one
of your pens last time?
Help yourself.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.444
You're holding Tasha Zapata
here at the FBI

10:11.444 --> 10:15.448
instead of handing her over
to the CIA where she belongs.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.750
Clearly an error was made.
It can happen.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.619
I'm here to see
that you fix it.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.322
Zapata is the subject
of an ongoing
FBI investigation

10:22.322 --> 10:26.125
and she won't be going anywhere
with you or anyone else
until I'm done with her.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.594
I don't even know why
I am talking to you.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.729
Well, at least we agree
on something.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.564
Didn't Weitz suspend you?
Yes.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.932
And then he un-suspended me.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.300
So, unless there's
something else,

10:34.300 --> 10:36.503
I kind of have a lot
on my plate right now, so...

10:36.503 --> 10:39.005
I will be back later today
with the authority

10:39.005 --> 10:41.574
to take that woman
into CIA custody,

10:41.574 --> 10:44.010
and I expect your full
and complete cooperation.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.045
You get that authority
and you will have it.

10:46.045 --> 10:49.048
You know, the CIA director's
very good friends
with both the AG

10:49.048 --> 10:51.251
and the director
of national intelligence.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.354
They might want to weigh-in
on this little situation.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.423
So, whatever this
investigation is,

10:57.423 --> 11:00.293
you better finish it fast.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.428
It's good to see you, Sabrina.
Thanks for the heads-up.

11:08.635 --> 11:12.038
I'm still a little confused
about why I'm here.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.574
Am I in some kind
of trouble?

11:14.574 --> 11:15.875
Any reason you would be?

11:15.875 --> 11:18.545
(chuckles)
Uh, no, not that I know of.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.180
We're just following some leads
on your mom's research.

11:21.180 --> 11:25.084
What do you know about
Zeta Interacting Protein, ZIP?

11:25.084 --> 11:27.453
Your mother worked
on it, right?
Uh, yeah.

11:27.453 --> 11:30.323
Well, she didn't really
talk much about her work.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.258
I mean, she was
a great scientist, but I--

11:32.258 --> 11:34.827
she just kind of wanted
to be a mom for me,
you know?

11:34.827 --> 11:36.763
So you were close?
Yeah.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.399
Did you follow
in her footsteps?

11:39.399 --> 11:40.466
I tried.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.902
When she died,
I almost dropped out.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.171
But I'm trying to honor her
in my own way,

11:45.171 --> 11:47.073
working in the field
she loved.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.375
It sounds like you're
a good son.
You should take a look at this.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.377
(Clay)
She always made time
for me,

11:51.377 --> 11:54.480
even when things
were busy at work
or when money was tight.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.650
We'd always go
to Henry's Diner
every Sunday.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.719
It was kind of our
weekly thing.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.854
(wincing, gasping)

12:04.357 --> 12:06.926
I noticed that you drive
a pretty nice car

12:06.926 --> 12:08.328
for a biology professor.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.829
Does that have anything to do
with the nice,

12:09.829 --> 12:12.298
big inheritance you got
when your mom died?

12:12.298 --> 12:14.834
Oh, I saved up.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.436
See, we've done some digging
on your mom.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.004
(Patterson)
You mentioned money
being tight.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.206
And for a woman trying
to make ends meet...

12:20.206 --> 12:22.208
And who declared bankruptcy...

12:22.208 --> 12:23.476
...she left you
a lot of money.

12:25.645 --> 12:29.115
We're suggesting she may have
done something illegal,
in case that wasn't clear.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.117
So, what aren't you
telling us?

12:31.117 --> 12:32.752
Where'd she get the money
for your trust?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.153
I swear to God,
I don't know.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.655
I was just--
You're lying
and you know something!

12:35.655 --> 12:37.090
I don't!
I don't know anything!
I swear!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.691
(Weller)
Or you did something

12:38.691 --> 12:40.326
to make sure
that you got that money.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.061
Is that why you're acting
so nervous?
Well, I'm nervous

12:42.061 --> 12:43.663
because you're scaring
the hell out of me.
Good!

12:43.663 --> 12:45.565
'Cause I'm gonna look
into every corner of your life.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.700
I'm gonna question
every person
you've ever known.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.771
And then I'm gonna unearth
every questionable thing
you've ever done, Clay.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.539
Kurt, can we step outside
for a second?

12:59.278 --> 13:02.382
He's trying to
cut out carbs, so...

13:02.382 --> 13:04.283
Do you see the room
we're in?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.219
This is a conversation,
not an investigation.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.054
He could be the key
to saving your life.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.790
And so if there's something
that he's not--
And I get more than anyone

13:10.790 --> 13:13.092
how much you want
the truth here,

13:13.092 --> 13:15.061
but if we're gonna
get anything from him,

13:15.061 --> 13:16.929
you have got
to dial it back.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.732
Kurt... your fire
is one of the things

13:19.732 --> 13:21.100
I love about you.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.903
but you need
to control it, okay?

13:23.903 --> 13:27.707
Um, agents that Reade sent
to Kearns Pharmaceuticals
just came up empty.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.877
Looks like they're getting ready
to lawyer up and give us
the old corporate runaround.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.012
Could be weeks
before we get answers.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.480
Weeks we don't have.
Yeah.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.382
So, unless someone
at Kearns talks...

13:36.382 --> 13:37.817
Clay's all we've got.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.192
What happened?

13:46.192 --> 13:47.894
He took a bullet
covering Jane

13:47.894 --> 13:49.929
doing the job
you were supposed
to be doing.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.065
And now he's hanging on
by a thread.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.571
I don't know what you thought
he could do for you

13:58.571 --> 14:01.040
or what lies you thought
he could help you shore up,

14:01.040 --> 14:02.508
but he can't save you.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.243
You might not like it,
but I'm the only thing

14:04.243 --> 14:05.812
standing between you
and the CIA,

14:05.812 --> 14:07.146
and they wanna put you
in a hole someplace

14:07.146 --> 14:08.614
no one's ever
even heard of.

14:08.614 --> 14:12.185
It's time to talk,
Zapata.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.053
Okay, I've got something.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.889
I was able to track
Roga's activity

14:16.889 --> 14:19.692
through well-hidden
shell accounts to...

14:19.692 --> 14:21.894
Thoeming Mutual,
which is...

14:21.894 --> 14:23.162
Thoeming Mutual!
I love them.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.997
...a bank known
for its shady dealings

14:24.997 --> 14:26.466
with shady characters.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.135
I was thinking
of a different Thoem--

14:29.135 --> 14:30.670
there's one in Canada,
I think.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.272
Anyway, they don't even
really exist anymore.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.374
They've been absorbed
by larger banks twice

14:35.374 --> 14:37.810
in the last two years,
but take a look at this.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.214
Does anything
look weird to you?

14:41.214 --> 14:43.349
How does somebody
set up a trust
the day after they died?

14:43.349 --> 14:44.450
Maybe they got
the date wrong,

14:44.450 --> 14:47.086
or maybe somebody else
set it up.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.521
Maybe she was a ghost.

14:48.521 --> 14:52.658
Or maybe on the day after
she allegedly died...

14:54.060 --> 14:57.163
...she walked right in
and did it herself,

14:57.163 --> 14:59.732
which means the one person
who could cure Jane...

14:59.732 --> 15:01.934
Is a ghost!
(groans)

15:01.934 --> 15:04.370
Is alive.
Oh, my God, she's alive.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.744
Why would this scientist
fake her own death?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.213
It's not an easy thing to do.
Are we sure this is legit?

15:14.213 --> 15:17.917
We have both a digital record
and a scanned hard copy
of the trust docs.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.087
And when we compared them...

15:21.087 --> 15:22.522
(Jane)
The dates don't match.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.891
Unfortunately,
it's pretty much impossible

15:24.891 --> 15:26.626
to find out who made
the alterations

15:26.626 --> 15:29.128
now that Thoeming Mutual
has been acquired twice.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.696
We were lucky
to find out what we did.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.833
I still feel like Clay knows
more than he's letting on.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.168
You think he knows
his mother's still alive?

15:35.168 --> 15:36.769
I think he would've
talked already.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.037
I mean, he was pretty
shaken up.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.105
Yeah, I've never
actually heard

15:39.105 --> 15:40.506
someone's teeth rattle.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.275
And even if he
doesn't know anything,

15:42.275 --> 15:45.077
if Clay was as close
to his mom as he says,

15:45.077 --> 15:47.313
maybe she's been
checking in on him.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.216
I can't believe this.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.018
Does this mean
she's alive?

15:52.018 --> 15:54.754
She's out there somewhere?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.656
We hope so.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.091
And we're hoping that you
can help us find her.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.793
I don't know anything.
Why wouldn't--

16:00.793 --> 16:02.128
Why wouldn't she
have told me?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.263
Clay, I know this
sounds crazy,

16:04.263 --> 16:07.033
but your mom had a reason
for doing this.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.135
We just don't
know it yet.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.137
Maybe she was trying
to protect someone she loves.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.339
Or maybe she's the one
that needs help.

16:13.339 --> 16:16.175
You think she's in danger?
(Patterson)
Well, we don't know that yet.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.044
Maybe you can help us
figure that out.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.545
Of course, whatever you need.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.314
Is it possible
that she tried

16:21.314 --> 16:22.648
to check in on you

16:22.648 --> 16:24.951
without you
being aware of it?

16:24.951 --> 16:27.019
I don't know.
Not that I know of.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.921
(Patterson)
Do you recognize
this man?

16:28.921 --> 16:30.756
He was looking
into your mom's work

16:30.756 --> 16:32.758
before she supposedly died.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.026
No.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.662
Uh! Hold the phone!
Phone records, actually.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.331
Clay's to be exact.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.601
You've got my phone records?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.970
Yeah, is that a problem?
You said it was cool
a second ago.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.938
Would you like
the court stenographer
to read it back for you?

16:45.938 --> 16:48.074
"Patterson: Maybe you can
help us figure that out."

16:48.074 --> 16:49.642
"Clay: Of course,
whatever you need."

16:49.642 --> 16:51.577
We good?
Yeah.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.746
What have you got, Rich?
Series of short phone calls

16:53.746 --> 16:57.350
with similar numbers made in
suspiciously regular intervals.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.218
Any of that, uh,
ring a bell, Clay?

16:59.218 --> 17:02.221
Yeah, but there was
never anyone there.

17:02.221 --> 17:05.057
They came in for months,
and then, when I canceled
my landline,

17:05.057 --> 17:06.592
they just started coming
to my cell.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.394
(Patterson)
These calls all came in
on Sunday nights.

17:08.394 --> 17:09.662
Every Sunday night.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.199
When we used to go out
to Henry's Diner.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.934
Clay, I think
that was your mom.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.036
You think
it's actually her?

17:17.036 --> 17:21.073
Clay, your mom was trying
to stay connected to you
the only way she could.

17:22.308 --> 17:25.545
Rich, Patterson,
please trace those calls.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.079
Yeah.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.753
Your alibi can't vouch.

17:33.753 --> 17:37.156
You've had some time
to think through it.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.357
Now, talk.

17:42.028 --> 17:45.431
Back at the hospital,
you had no idea Keaton
was in a coma, did you?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.635
Toronto, Friday,
6:00 a.m.

17:49.635 --> 17:50.503
Don't be late.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.071
I have somewhere
I need to be,

17:52.071 --> 17:53.239
and if I don't get there,

17:53.239 --> 17:55.341
something terrible
is going to happen.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.510
Something worse than
what you've already
been doing?

17:58.811 --> 18:01.147
Tasha, you want me
to give, I gotta get.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.149
Reade, please.
Talk.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.554
I've been deep-cover
with the CIA the whole time.

18:08.554 --> 18:11.324
What do you mean,
"the whole time"?

18:11.324 --> 18:12.725
What kind of job?

18:12.725 --> 18:13.993
Above top-secret.

18:13.993 --> 18:17.530
Off-book, deep-cover,
and dangerous as hell.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.332
And I think
you're perfect for it.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.100
So, how would it work?

18:21.100 --> 18:24.003
I'd be your handler
and you'd answer
only to me.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.671
No one can know anything
about this.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.873
Not Reade,
not Weller, no one.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.308
Who'd know at the CIA?

18:29.308 --> 18:30.843
You're looking at him.

18:30.843 --> 18:34.614
You do this,
you walk away
from everyone.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.817
And I don't know when
or if you come back.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.292
I'm in.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.733
There's a shredder
at the office.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.235
Okay, so,
what was the plan?

18:56.235 --> 18:57.603
If Hank Crawford went down,

18:57.603 --> 18:59.739
HCI Global would just find
another leader.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.741
Keaton wanted somebody
on the inside

19:01.741 --> 19:03.776
to deal with whoever
took his place.

19:03.776 --> 19:04.944
What was your in?

19:04.944 --> 19:06.912
Crawford's daughter Blake.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.415
I'm Julie Page.
I work for Tracy Zazlo

19:09.415 --> 19:11.684
at the Friedman Foundation
for Clean Air.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.185
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Julie.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.487
(static over speakers)

19:14.487 --> 19:16.155
I just lost Zapata's signal.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.225
Well, I'll see you
downstairs.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.626
Blake.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.330
Your father's being
arrested today

19:24.330 --> 19:25.831
and so is
your boyfriend.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.401
I need you to listen
to me very carefully

19:28.401 --> 19:30.569
because I am trying
to protect you.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.538
What the hell are you
talking about?
Who are you?

19:32.538 --> 19:35.141
My name is Tasha,
and I'm a friend.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.609
You're with the FBI.
No.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.844
So then you're CIA.
Not anymore.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.646
I work for me now.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.549
And if you want
to get through this,
you'll need my help.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.321
So you just make a move,
she bites,

19:49.321 --> 19:50.623
and you reel her right in?

19:50.623 --> 19:52.324
That's it?
Yeah.

19:52.324 --> 19:53.859
Turns out,
I'm pretty good
at this stuff.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.661
Yeah, you are.

19:55.661 --> 19:58.731
So you trick your way
into being besties
with Blake,

19:58.731 --> 20:02.101
but then we watched you
get chewed out
and fired by Keaton.

20:02.101 --> 20:05.337
Do you have any idea
the chance I took on you,

20:05.337 --> 20:08.441
bringing a hotheaded
FBI amateur
into the big leagues?

20:08.441 --> 20:09.709
Because this is
on my head now.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.877
You just became
my mistake.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.746
You're right.
Maybe we should
speak privately.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.980
You think so?

20:18.017 --> 20:20.786
What was that?
That was theater
for our benefit?

20:20.786 --> 20:22.354
We needed to make it look
like I was going rogue

20:22.354 --> 20:24.790
in order to solidify
my cover story with Blake.

20:24.790 --> 20:28.494
Had to be a clean break.
You call that clean?

20:28.494 --> 20:29.729
You and Keaton have
a good laugh

20:29.729 --> 20:31.564
in the hallway
afterwards?
No.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.300
That's one
of the hardest things
I've ever done.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.603
Well, you played
that perfectly.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.672
Bonus points for the tears,
by the way.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.441
They bought every word.
This doesn't feel right.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.510
We could still
read them in.
No.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.945
The only way this flies is

20:45.945 --> 20:48.581
if you've burned your bridges
at the CIA and the FBI.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.350
You're free to go
behind enemy lines now
with zero baggage.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.119
Yeah.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.621
Now, get back in there
and tell them you're done
at the CIA.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.756
And don't bother getting
your affairs in order.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.259
Don't do anything
that looks like a good-bye.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.865
And that was also
the night that we...

21:12.171 --> 21:14.640
See you soon.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.877
I thought it might be
the last time I'd see you.

21:19.945 --> 21:24.550
But you can think
whatever you want,
but that was real.

21:24.550 --> 21:28.521
Keaton called
the next morning
to say it was go-time.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.123
Okay, so you fake
getting fired

21:31.123 --> 21:33.626
to infiltrate
the Crawford Organization,

21:33.626 --> 21:36.529
take down HCI Global,
and arrest Roman,

21:36.529 --> 21:39.231
but you have
to stay deep-cover

21:39.231 --> 21:40.566
when Blake kills Roman.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.201
Do I have that right?

21:42.201 --> 21:44.370
(scoffs)

21:44.370 --> 21:47.807
I know how it sounds...
but it's true.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.608
Every word.
Even if it is,

21:49.608 --> 21:51.510
and that's a big "if,"

21:51.510 --> 21:53.512
you still should've
told the team.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.514
Lie or not,
you still betrayed us.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.117
I wanted to tell you
so many times.

21:58.117 --> 22:03.088
I just...
I couldn't.

22:03.088 --> 22:04.657
After Madeline
murdered Blake

22:04.657 --> 22:06.425
and the board
at HCI Global,

22:06.425 --> 22:08.527
I knew I was
in over my head.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.933
(all coughing and groaning)

22:13.933 --> 22:15.568
(guns clicking)

22:15.568 --> 22:18.804
Now, what to do about you.

22:18.804 --> 22:21.207
You need to get me out of here.
We need to regroup.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.475
Come at this a different way.
I want to bring in the team.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.444
(Keaton)
No, you don't switch
horses mid-stream.

22:25.444 --> 22:28.747
The fact that you're still
alive means she trusts you.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.416
Your proximity
and access to Madeline

22:30.416 --> 22:31.850
are the best shot we have.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.119
I just watched her murder
a roomful of people.

22:34.119 --> 22:35.654
That's not enough
to bring her down?

22:35.654 --> 22:37.223
The whole company has to fall,

22:37.223 --> 22:39.425
or she just gets replaced
by the next psychopath.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.960
You're doing fine, Tasha.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.662
You come out when I say
and not a second before.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.632
So you wanted out
and Keaton said no?

22:46.632 --> 22:49.602
I wanted your help
and he said no.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.238
But he was cool with you
and Claudia tying me up,
beating the hell out of me,

22:52.238 --> 22:54.907
and stealing documents
from a secure FBI server?

22:54.907 --> 22:56.675
I thought Claudia
was going to kill you.

22:56.675 --> 22:59.511
I knocked you out
to keep you alive.

22:59.511 --> 23:00.779
Later that night,
I found out

23:00.779 --> 23:02.248
she wasn't who
she said she was.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.683
She's MI6.

23:04.683 --> 23:07.419
How do you know that?

23:07.419 --> 23:09.855
Something didn't add up,
so I did some digging

23:09.855 --> 23:12.691
and found out she was
British Intelligence.

23:12.691 --> 23:14.894
I told Claudia I was CIA.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.229
Madeline was
getting suspicious
of both of us,

23:17.229 --> 23:20.566
so we decided one of us
would sacrifice ourselves

23:20.566 --> 23:23.569
to help the other
appear loyal to Madeline.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.170
(gunshots)

23:34.880 --> 23:36.115
Good luck.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.085
What, did you guys
flip a coin

23:40.085 --> 23:41.854
to figure out
which one of you
got shot?

23:41.854 --> 23:44.857
Everything I am
telling you is true,

23:44.857 --> 23:46.558
but I can't give you
anything else.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.394
This mission is
too sensitive.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.429
If I am not somewhere
by 6:00 a.m.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.564
tomorrow morning,
everything falls apart.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.767
Where?
We'll bring
the entire team.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.903
I can't tell you.
I need to go in alone.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.306
Okay, so, now,
you don't want
to tell the team?

24:00.306 --> 24:01.774
I'm-I'm a little
confused here.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.242
It is not the team
I don't trust.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.511
Madeline has ears
everywhere.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.447
Contact MI6.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.416
Claudia will verify
my story.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.751
I reached to them before.
They're not verifying anything.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.220
But fine, I'll give 'em
another shot.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.555
Just sit here.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.726
Reade, I am
running out of time.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.828
Damn right about that.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.835
So the calls we think came
from your mom

24:29.835 --> 24:31.670
were routed through a number
of pretty serious

24:31.670 --> 24:33.238
VPN masking protocols.

24:33.238 --> 24:36.809
It took some doing, but we were
able to trace the source.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.844
This "X" marks the spot
where she is.

24:38.844 --> 24:41.447
My God, that's amazing!
When can we go?

24:41.447 --> 24:42.781
Clay, you'll have to stay put

24:42.781 --> 24:44.316
until we have a handle
on the situation.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.784
Yeah, she's right.

24:45.784 --> 24:48.187
We hope the calls lead us
to your mom as well,

24:48.187 --> 24:49.955
but we won't know anything
until we get there.

24:49.955 --> 24:53.125
Can I tell my fiancée?
Not yet.
I'm sorry.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.260
Well, if it is her,
tell her I miss her.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.763
We will.
Let's move.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.465
Rachel, can you
take him back

24:59.465 --> 25:01.000
to the conference room,
please?

25:07.206 --> 25:10.175
(Clay on recording)
Honey, I'm not supposed
to be telling you this, but you won't believe it.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.877
Those weird calls
I kept getting?

25:11.877 --> 25:14.513
It was her.
My mom's alive.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.682
I told you
she wasn't dead.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.350
We are weeks away
from the biggest roll-out

25:18.350 --> 25:19.618
in the history
of this company.

25:19.618 --> 25:22.721
If we are exposed now,
we lose everything.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.591
Tell me you can
track the calls back
to her location.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.159
I have somebody on it.
Good!

25:27.159 --> 25:28.761
I want Roga dead
by the end of the day.

25:28.761 --> 25:32.297
And this time, Reggie,
she needs to stay that way.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.253
Oh, nice spot.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.222
Has a certain "no one
can hear you scream" vibe.

26:00.759 --> 26:04.596
Are you sure you wanna
hang back here with Rich?
I've endured worse.

26:04.596 --> 26:07.032
Yeah, welcome to my world.
Okay, this is all
really hurtful.

26:07.032 --> 26:09.101
Look, I'm just not sure
I'm ready for anything

26:09.101 --> 26:11.937
beyond a support role yet,
but we've got you covered.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.672
I don't care what role
you play out here.

26:13.672 --> 26:16.809
Just happy to have
my partner back.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.044
Now, should we go and find
ourselves a dead scientist?

26:24.016 --> 26:25.184
What?

26:25.184 --> 26:28.620
He used to tell me
to stay in the car.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.689
Now he wants me
to get out of it.

26:30.689 --> 26:33.058
You guys are adorable.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.998
(knocking on door)

26:39.998 --> 26:42.134
(gun clicks)
Hey, oh, oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:42.134 --> 26:44.570
Don't shoot.
FBI.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.038
Prove it.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.173
(Jane)
Kurt?
We're okay, Jane.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.241
Stand down.

26:49.241 --> 26:53.278
Ma'am, I'm gonna
show you my badge.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.115
It's here.
See?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.383
(Patterson)
We talked
to your son Clay.

26:58.383 --> 27:01.653
Please, put the gun down.
All we need is your help.

27:01.653 --> 27:04.556
Kurt, do you need us?
Negative.
Hold your position.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.825
I'm sure the last thing
your son wants

27:06.825 --> 27:08.293
after learning
his mom is alive

27:08.293 --> 27:10.696
is to hear that she
just killed two FBI agents.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.297
(Weller)
We know you created ZIP.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.032
And we have reason to believe
you've been working

27:14.032 --> 27:15.868
on the cure
for its side-effects.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.803
Side-effects?
It's fatal.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.539
(Patterson)
We know, but if you're
willing to help us,

27:20.539 --> 27:22.441
we can try to get you
your life back,

27:22.441 --> 27:24.576
reunite you
with your son.

27:24.576 --> 27:25.844
(Weller)
Please.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.913
You're our last chance.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.485
(Weller)
All right, we're good.
Heading inside.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.521
(both exhale)

27:35.521 --> 27:37.890
You know, for someone
who said they were good
hanging back,

27:37.890 --> 27:40.759
it really seemed like
you wanted to get out
of the van there.

27:40.759 --> 27:43.061
I'm good right here.
So, uh, how does it feel

27:43.061 --> 27:47.065
to be scientifically de-eviled
once and for all?

27:47.065 --> 27:51.670
Even knowing Remi's
not coming back,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.505
all of these
dark memories of hers

27:53.505 --> 27:55.040
just keep rolling out
in my head.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.843
I-I-I see something,
or hear something,

27:57.843 --> 27:59.044
and then,
all of the sudden,

27:59.044 --> 28:02.748
I'm remembering
some horrible new thing.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.349
It's like a minefield.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.218
I totally know what
that feeling's like.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.287
I mean, I'll remind you
that, not too long ago,

28:08.287 --> 28:11.423
I myself was responsible
for some pretty dodgy
shenanigans.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.192
Which, by the way,
is the name of my Dickensian
LARPing character.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.628
My point is, you know,
there are a broad range
of things

28:16.628 --> 28:19.331
on which I am
incapable of feeling
normal human shame,

28:19.331 --> 28:23.001
but, uh, there are
a few exceptions.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.370
Like what?
You know,
it's just like you.

28:25.370 --> 28:29.274
I have certain things
in my past that haunt me.

28:29.274 --> 28:32.311
I don't even have
the "good me, bad me" excuse
to fall back on.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.846
Although I was doing
mountains of coke
back then, so...

28:34.846 --> 28:37.282
And you, uh, do you
feel like you changed

28:37.282 --> 28:39.952
since you've been
on the team?
Without a doubt.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.753
I mean,
don't tell everybody,

28:41.753 --> 28:46.224
but I'm pretty sure
I'm actually fairly reformed
thanks to you guys.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.760
I feel like if Remi had
stuck around long enough,

28:48.760 --> 28:50.329
she would've been
reformed too.

28:50.329 --> 28:53.899
I don't know.
She was pretty angry.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.534
It's easier
to make good choices

28:55.534 --> 28:57.269
when you surround yourself
with good people.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.871
Kind of rubs off on you.
Not in a weird way.

28:59.871 --> 29:01.506
Don't make it dirty, please.
I'm in the middle

29:01.506 --> 29:03.575
of something emotional here.

29:03.575 --> 29:07.746
I guess just... every day
you gotta make a choice

29:07.746 --> 29:09.348
to be Good Jane.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.452
Thanks, Rich.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.721
Although I wouldn't completely
abandon the idea of Remi,

29:15.721 --> 29:18.924
'cause, I mean,
as a Halloween costume,
good Lord.

29:20.692 --> 29:21.893
Okay.

29:24.229 --> 29:26.698
You've got a G-68 centrifuge

29:26.698 --> 29:29.935
and the Maxor Autoclave
and Sterilization unit?

29:29.935 --> 29:31.470
If you just had
the Raddatz Hybridization Oven,

29:31.470 --> 29:33.438
this would be
the coolest home lab--

29:35.674 --> 29:38.310
Come on.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.878
(clears throat)

29:41.179 --> 29:43.215
Have you ever met
this man?

29:44.983 --> 29:47.486
Is he okay?
I'm afraid he's dead.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.822
(Dr. Roga)
I wasn't fast enough.

29:50.822 --> 29:52.224
So you were looking
for a cure?

29:52.224 --> 29:55.027
Yes, for a condition
that I gave him.

29:55.027 --> 29:58.130
My assistant Dale and I,
we were working on treatments

29:58.130 --> 30:00.132
for Alzheimer's Disease
and some other

30:00.132 --> 30:02.668
neurodegenerative disorders.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.569
ZIP looked promising at first,

30:04.569 --> 30:07.305
but when side-effects
proved fatal, we insisted

30:07.305 --> 30:09.841
that the project
be terminated.

30:09.841 --> 30:13.078
We were told it was,
but they lied to us.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.446
Must be how Sandstorm
got 'em.

30:14.446 --> 30:17.282
When I confronted Kearns
with evidence of the sale,

30:17.282 --> 30:19.418
my boss gave me
a pat on the head,

30:19.418 --> 30:22.187
assured me all was well,
and sent me on my way.

30:22.187 --> 30:25.424
The next day,
Dale died.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.526
And that was when
Roman approached me.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.162
He had been keeping tabs
on us and our work.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.298
He knew how much danger
I was in before I did.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.600
So he helped you fake
your own death?

30:35.600 --> 30:36.902
Yeah.

30:36.902 --> 30:40.238
And set you up
with this kick-ass lab.

30:40.238 --> 30:42.340
He was bankrolling
your research.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.942
And your son's
trust account.

30:45.610 --> 30:47.946
How close are you
to finding a cure?

30:47.946 --> 30:49.915
Oh, I have it.

30:49.915 --> 30:52.818
I've just been waiting
for Roman to come back.
I've had it for months.

30:52.818 --> 30:55.153
I'm sorry.
You've got it here now?

30:55.153 --> 30:57.089
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Yeah, I just wish

30:57.089 --> 30:58.857
that I could've
worked faster.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.227
It's too late
to save Roman,

31:02.227 --> 31:04.696
but it's not too late
to save his sister.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.164
Will you help us?

31:06.164 --> 31:08.133
(Dr. Roga)
I'd be happy to.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.641
MI6 isn't exactly racing
to verify your story.

31:16.641 --> 31:18.376
Neither one of us
has time to wait.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.146
You have exactly
one more chance
to come clean.

31:21.146 --> 31:24.182
What happens tomorrow
at 6:00 a.m.?

31:26.418 --> 31:28.720
Do you know who Del Toro is?
The hacker.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.388
Supposedly unbeatable.

31:30.388 --> 31:33.291
I am supposed
to meet him in Toronto,
recruit him for Madeline.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.026
Look.

31:35.026 --> 31:37.763
I get that if you are
still CIA,

31:37.763 --> 31:39.131
you have a plan
of your own,

31:39.131 --> 31:42.033
but if you don't tell me
everything right now,

31:42.033 --> 31:43.401
that plan is over.

31:45.303 --> 31:48.673
Madeline wants
to crash a plane.

31:48.673 --> 31:50.008
I don't know which one,

31:50.008 --> 31:51.977
just that innocent people
will die.

31:51.977 --> 31:54.346
And if I don't show up
to that meet with Del Toro

31:54.346 --> 31:56.915
and figure out a way
to control this,

31:56.915 --> 32:00.852
she's gonna find
somebody else to do it
without me, for real.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.321
(cell phone buzzing)

32:03.321 --> 32:06.191
What is it?
It's MI6.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.360
They haven't heard
from Claudia in weeks.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.062
She's been labeled missing
and presumed dead.

32:11.062 --> 32:13.131
They're saying
you're lying.

32:20.238 --> 32:22.274
Of course MI6 would say
they haven't heard
from Claudia.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.944
We are both deep-cover
on a compartmented op.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.046
They cannot risk anyone
knowing she's alive.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.849
Not you,
not the FBI.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.585
Reade, I have
told you everything,

32:33.585 --> 32:37.489
even though that defies
a direct order
from my boss.

32:37.489 --> 32:40.192
And I know how crazy
this sounds,

32:40.192 --> 32:42.961
but this, right here,
this is me.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.832
I am so sorry for what
I put you through.

32:46.832 --> 32:50.001
I can't imagine
what you must have
thought of me.

32:50.001 --> 32:52.938
Who says I've stopped?

32:52.938 --> 32:55.574
Just know that whatever
terrible things
you wished on me,

32:55.574 --> 32:58.276
I wished something
a million times worse.

32:58.276 --> 33:02.214
Yes, I kept things from you.
I hurt you.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.548
But I swear to you,

33:03.548 --> 33:06.184
I am telling you the truth
right now, every word.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.454
Reade, if you don't
let me walk out of here,

33:09.454 --> 33:12.224
everything I worked for
will be destroyed.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.725
People will die.

33:13.725 --> 33:17.362
And all of the horrible things
I did to you, to us,

33:17.362 --> 33:19.931
it will have been
for nothing.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.834
Reade, please,
listen to your gut.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.003
Let me go.

33:29.107 --> 33:32.110
My answer is no.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.179
I'm not gonna
let you go.

33:38.450 --> 33:41.186
I'm sending you back out.
I'm your handler now.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.121
But get something straight.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.657
Me and you,
we're done, finished.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.559
Whatever relationship,
friendship,

33:47.559 --> 33:51.162
whatever this was we had,
it's over.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.531
I will never
forgive you for this.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.468
Reade, listen--
No, you listen.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.637
You will never
get close to me again.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.576
But if you're
telling the truth,
then you're our best shot

34:04.576 --> 34:08.246
at taking down Madeline,
so you're going back out.

34:08.246 --> 34:11.249
You have a function,
and you will serve it

34:11.249 --> 34:13.218
until that function
is over.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.397
All you had to do
was tell me.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.934
I could've helped you,
but instead, here we are.

34:28.934 --> 34:32.304
And if I find out
you've been lying about
an inch of any of this,

34:32.304 --> 34:34.539
I swear I'll put you
in a hole myself.

34:42.914 --> 34:47.419
It's gonna take me a few moments
to prepare the stem cells
for transport.

34:47.419 --> 34:51.056
If I don't control
the temperature meticulously,

34:51.056 --> 34:53.191
it could render
the cells useless.

34:53.191 --> 34:54.759
But you can
get more, right?

34:54.759 --> 34:57.128
No, this is the only batch
I have,

34:57.128 --> 34:58.530
and they are the key
to the cure.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.298
They're called
the Stanton cells.

35:00.298 --> 35:02.734
(Patterson)
Uh, the Stanton cells?

35:02.734 --> 35:04.903
I thought that was a myth.
Impossible to find.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.104
Crazy-unique
genetic markers.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.772
They're real.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.842
How did you
even find them?
Roman.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.545
Whatever I asked for,
he would just bring it.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.513
Seems like you guys
were pretty close.

35:15.513 --> 35:18.416
When I had to shut myself off
from my own son,

35:18.416 --> 35:21.720
it was so nice to have
someone to talk to.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.154
It helped.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.557
(Weller)
Knowing what Roman's life
was like,

35:25.557 --> 35:27.459
I'm sure it
helped him too.

35:33.531 --> 35:36.134
Weller, Patterson,
we got company.

35:40.338 --> 35:42.240
Okay, you got five
coming your way.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.610
(Jane)
We've lost line of sight.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.445
And they're heading
into the house.

35:53.284 --> 35:54.919
(heavy breathing)

35:54.919 --> 35:58.089
Jane Doe, you are
1,000% you again.

35:58.089 --> 36:01.259
You need to put
the past behind you
and trust yourself now.

36:01.259 --> 36:03.461
Get out there
and do some good.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.202
They must be in the shed.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.412
Get down! Get down!

36:26.818 --> 36:29.254
This thing go any faster?!
It's a delicate process.

36:29.254 --> 36:30.922
A few degrees off
and it could completely--

36:33.324 --> 36:35.560
You okay?
No.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.299
(gunfire)

36:46.838 --> 36:47.839
Aah!

36:57.015 --> 36:58.116
(alarm trilling)

36:58.116 --> 36:59.350
(Weller)
You okay?

37:04.355 --> 37:06.191
(alarm trilling, squealing)

37:06.191 --> 37:08.359
(groaning)

37:08.359 --> 37:09.928
Got her, Patterson?

37:09.928 --> 37:11.763
Guys, I think you might be
aware of this already,

37:11.763 --> 37:13.231
but the freaking building's
on fire,

37:13.231 --> 37:14.432
so maybe you wanna
get out of there.

37:17.202 --> 37:19.370
Kurt... Kurt,
you have to get out.

37:19.370 --> 37:22.974
No!
We need those stem cells!

37:22.974 --> 37:24.609
It's our last chance!

37:24.609 --> 37:26.745
(alarm squealing,
glass cracking)

37:31.049 --> 37:32.784
It's too late.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.754
Come on. Okay.

38:05.150 --> 38:07.318
Hey.

38:07.318 --> 38:09.053
You can't
beat yourself up.

38:09.053 --> 38:11.055
You did your best.
(groans)

38:11.055 --> 38:13.525
If I'd been a little faster,
I could've saved 'em.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.993
Could've?
Wait, could've what?

38:14.993 --> 38:19.097
Burned yourself up quicker?
I like you better alive.

38:19.097 --> 38:22.000
There's nothing
you could've done
to save those stem cells.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.935
Yeah, she's right.
I mean, they were
pretty much deep-fried

38:23.935 --> 38:26.304
the second that place
went "Towering Inferno."

38:26.304 --> 38:28.740
I'm sorry
for how I am.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.875
We'll keep looking
for a cure, Jane.

38:30.875 --> 38:33.511
Yeah, and we will
find one.

38:33.511 --> 38:37.148
Well, at least
something good came of this.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.950
Uh, I just...

38:38.950 --> 38:42.854
I just wanted to say thanks
to you guys for getting
my mom back.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.890
We're happy you get
to be a family again.
You deserve it.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.293
Is it really gonna be safe
for us out there now?
(Reade) It is.

38:48.293 --> 38:49.694
Your old boss
at Kearns Pharmaceuticals

38:49.694 --> 38:51.663
and his co-conspirators
have just been arrested.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.465
They won't be bothering you
for a long time.
Thank you.

38:54.465 --> 38:56.201
All of you.

38:56.201 --> 38:59.771
And Jane,
when your brother
and I last spoke,

38:59.771 --> 39:02.340
he talked about
tracking down
a possible lead

39:02.340 --> 39:04.742
on another batch
of Stanton cells.

39:04.742 --> 39:07.612
Now, he said
it would be difficult,

39:07.612 --> 39:10.648
but now I know why
he wanted it so badly.

39:10.648 --> 39:13.484
It was for you.

39:13.484 --> 39:14.953
He loved you.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.655
Thank you.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.490
Well, if you find
the cells,

39:19.490 --> 39:21.693
I'll synthesize the cure.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.261
In the meantime...

39:23.261 --> 39:26.431
We have a lot of Sundays
at Henry's Diner to catch up on.

39:26.431 --> 39:27.966
Thank you.

39:33.471 --> 39:35.139
(Larren)
You let her go?

39:35.139 --> 39:37.675
Do you have actual proof
that she's not a traitor?

39:37.675 --> 39:39.377
No.
I went with my gut.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.845
Well, your gut just made
a huge mistake.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.448
Everything that goes wrong
from here on out,

39:43.448 --> 39:46.784
everything that Zapata does,
that's on you now.

39:46.784 --> 39:49.587
I'm aware.
This is not over.

39:54.325 --> 39:55.793
Hey.

39:55.793 --> 39:58.162
You're still not gonna
let yourself off the hook?

39:58.162 --> 40:01.766
Dr. Roga just said there
are more cells out there.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.701
They could be anywhere.
But they're not.

40:03.701 --> 40:06.337
They're somewhere,
and we're gonna find them.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.839
You sound
pretty confident.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.708
Well, I learned
two things today.
What's that?

40:10.708 --> 40:13.411
One, no matter what
I may have been in the past,

40:13.411 --> 40:16.948
I still belong
out in the field
doing good right now.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.216
We agree on that.

40:18.216 --> 40:22.453
And two, I've got a man
who's literally willing

40:22.453 --> 40:25.189
to walk through fire
to save my life.

40:25.189 --> 40:28.026
With someone like that
in my corner,

40:28.026 --> 40:29.994
we can do anything.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.665
I'm not gonna
lose you, Jane.

40:33.665 --> 40:36.601
I'm never,
ever gonna give up.

40:39.237 --> 40:40.605
What?

40:40.605 --> 40:44.042
You keep saying that.
I like it.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.977
(cell phone buzzing)

40:48.946 --> 40:50.114
Claudia.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.951
I almost didn't recognize you
without the mask.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.653
I shouldn't be contacting you,
but I heard

40:55.653 --> 40:57.588
you were asking around
for me at MI6.

40:57.588 --> 40:59.090
You're very persistent.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.358
And you're looking
very good for someone

41:00.358 --> 41:01.759
who's supposed to be dead.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.194
I'm calling to confirm

41:03.194 --> 41:04.829
that everything Zapata said
was true,

41:04.829 --> 41:07.765
and to say I'm sorry

41:07.765 --> 41:09.834
about how things went down
in your apartment.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.469
That makes two of us.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.072
And for the record,
I was never going to kill you.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.674
I was just trying
to make it look good.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.509
Turns out, Zapata was doing
the same thing.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.645
We just didn't know
we were on the same side.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.648
Life's funny sometimes.
Hysterical.

41:23.648 --> 41:27.385
You should just know that it
was nothing personal on my end

41:27.385 --> 41:29.387
and that she cares about you.

41:29.387 --> 41:33.057
So is this an apology?
It is.

41:33.057 --> 41:35.760
Accepted.
Thanks for the call.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.562
Good luck.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.570
(Zapata)
I'm at the meet location.

41:45.570 --> 41:50.942
Our friend should be here
in a little over 15 minutes.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.378
Actually, he's here early.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.013
Call you soon.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.082
Hey.

41:58.082 --> 42:02.320
I, uh...
I appreciate your punctuality.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.654
I'm Tasha.
I--

42:03.654 --> 42:06.791
(muffled screaming)

42:10.094 --> 42:11.796
(handcuffs ratcheting)
Aah!

42:13.264 --> 42:15.633
The CIA would like a word.

42:48.132 --> 42:49.767
(man)
Greg, move your head!
