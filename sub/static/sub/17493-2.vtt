00:02.000 --> 00:03.840
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:03.840 --> 00:05.840
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:07.200 --> 00:09.080
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:11.240 --> 00:12.960
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:15.720 --> 00:20.000
Today, Sarah and Duck are visiting their friend, Scarf Lady,

00:20.000 --> 00:21.880
to see what she's up to.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.600
Hello, Scarf Lady.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.640
Oh, hello, dears.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.080
Come in, come in.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.120
Hmm.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.360
Oh, knit sticks! That's not right.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.120
It's not right at all.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.760
Hey, watch where you're throwing things!

00:39.760 --> 00:41.080
What's wrong?

00:41.080 --> 00:42.800
I'm out of ideas.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.000
I'm well and truly knit stuck.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.880
Maybe...

00:46.880 --> 00:49.200
a sit-and-think will help.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.280
It's worth a try.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.960
Hmm!

00:52.960 --> 00:54.480
Hmm.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.200
QUACK, QUACK!

00:56.200 --> 00:58.240
Ah! A hat.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.880
Where?

00:59.880 --> 01:01.920
Excuse me, Duck.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.040
QUACK!

01:03.040 --> 01:04.480
There's hats here.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.320
A hat museum?

01:06.320 --> 01:09.760
That's just the place to get some new ideas.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.960
Oh, I don't... I don't know, dear.

01:12.960 --> 01:17.920
It's quite far away and, um, isn't the weather looking a bit dodgy?

01:17.920 --> 01:19.680
BIRDSONG

01:19.680 --> 01:21.520
No.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.320
Oh, well.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.120
OK.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.160
Whoa!

01:31.160 --> 01:34.080
Big hats!

01:34.080 --> 01:36.720
Looks strangely familiar.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.880
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.680
Oh!

01:50.400 --> 01:53.880
Ah, welcome to my hat museum!

01:53.880 --> 01:57.440
So many hats but only one head.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.000
There's never enough.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.160
I've had enough.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.840
Yes, well, perhaps we should go, then.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.720
- OWNER:
- Is that you, Scarfie?

02:05.720 --> 02:10.240
My old sporting friend, back for another balloon race?

02:10.240 --> 02:11.840
No, thank you.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.960
But we were hoping that she might find some hat inspiration here.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.600
Sh! Shush!

02:17.600 --> 02:20.480
Scarf Lady's run out of ideas.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.320
YOU need MY help?

02:23.320 --> 02:24.440
No.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.480
Yes.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.440
Well, why didn't you say so, Scarfie?

02:28.440 --> 02:32.080
I'll give you the guided tour. Follow me.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.440
- Come on, Scarf Lady. - QUACK-QUACK!

02:34.440 --> 02:36.080
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.040
Wow!

02:41.040 --> 02:43.040
All the hats!

02:44.040 --> 02:45.200
Oh!

02:45.200 --> 02:46.800
QUACK!

02:46.800 --> 02:48.440
- QUACK!
- SHE GIGGLES

02:50.400 --> 02:51.480
Ooh!

02:53.480 --> 02:54.760
Ah!

02:56.000 --> 02:57.800
- SARAH QUACKS
- QUACK?

02:57.800 --> 02:59.720
I'm about to duck!

02:59.720 --> 03:00.760
QUACK!

03:01.800 --> 03:06.640
To your left, the tallest top hat ever made.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.960
I'll take a nice knitted bobble hat any day of the week.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.520
No, no, no, no, no.

03:11.520 --> 03:15.000
There's absolutely no knit in my collection!

03:15.000 --> 03:16.080
How's this?

03:16.080 --> 03:17.200
QUACK-QUACK.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.840
Oh, er...very smart, dears.

03:19.840 --> 03:23.120
Come along. We've barely gotten started.

03:24.880 --> 03:29.680
Here is Bread Man's first toque, still covered in flour.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.240
Oh, it NEVER comes off.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.360
- SARAH SNIFFS
- Mmm! Smells good.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.160
QUACK! QUACK!

03:38.160 --> 03:39.720
- Ah! - QUACK!

03:39.720 --> 03:41.160
Ooh!

03:41.160 --> 03:43.200
Whose was that, then?

03:43.200 --> 03:45.120
It belonged to Moon.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.840
Didn't suit him, bless.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.360
Ah, bless!

03:50.680 --> 03:52.840
Ooh!

03:52.840 --> 03:55.760
He does look like a clever chap.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.440
Hmm.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.960
Lots of ideas.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.040
QUACK!

04:02.040 --> 04:03.440
QUACK!

04:03.440 --> 04:05.600
Ah, good hat.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.040
QUACK!

04:09.040 --> 04:12.200
Aha! Very inspirational.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.240
Oh, yes. Let's show Scarf lady.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.280
QUACK!

04:19.120 --> 04:21.840
Oh, don't you look the pair!

04:21.840 --> 04:23.440
A right pair!

04:23.440 --> 04:26.840
I don't suppose this is helping you get any ideas?

04:26.840 --> 04:29.200
- I'm not sure, dear.
- Be careful.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.760
They're very delicate.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.000
Oh!

04:32.000 --> 04:34.280
- QUACK! - Oh.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.440
Come along. More to see.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.160
Ahh!

04:41.160 --> 04:42.360
Balloon!

04:42.360 --> 04:44.880
I thought I recognised it.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.440
Quite the launchpad, eh, Scarfie?

04:47.440 --> 04:50.480
- Quite.
- But that's not all.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.160
Behold!

04:54.160 --> 04:56.360
Hats of every colour possible

04:56.360 --> 05:00.640
but I've yet to gather the perfect green to complete the collection.

05:00.640 --> 05:01.840
Ooh!

05:02.880 --> 05:04.280
QUACK!

05:04.280 --> 05:06.680
- DUCK BLOWS A RASPBERRY
- Ha-ha!

05:06.680 --> 05:10.480
How did I not notice this charming specimen?

05:11.720 --> 05:16.080
I don't suppose you'd care to make a donation?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.880
Oh!

05:17.880 --> 05:18.960
QUACK!

05:18.960 --> 05:20.000
Er...

05:21.320 --> 05:22.960
OK.

05:22.960 --> 05:26.600
Thank you. Thank you! You won't regret it!

05:26.600 --> 05:28.520
Oh!

05:28.520 --> 05:30.320
Just watch this!

05:33.560 --> 05:34.840
My word!

05:35.840 --> 05:37.600
Knit me silly!

05:37.600 --> 05:38.760
Champion!

05:38.760 --> 05:40.880
Wow!

05:40.880 --> 05:43.320
You've outdone yourself, Hattie.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.960
Definitely worth adding knit to your collection for this.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.320
What's that, old boy?

05:48.320 --> 05:49.600
My hat.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.040
Always check the label, Hattie.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.680
Oh, good grief!

05:54.680 --> 05:56.800
I have...knit!

05:58.000 --> 06:00.320
Hmm... It's cold, Duck.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.360
QUACK!

06:03.120 --> 06:04.960
Oh, just a sec.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.360
NEEDLES CLICK

06:07.360 --> 06:09.040
Try this on for size.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.480
Oh, it's good.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.520
- Thank you, Scarf Lady.
- Not finished yet.

06:19.080 --> 06:23.000
Ooh! Oh!

06:23.000 --> 06:24.560
- Ha-ha! - QUACK!

06:24.560 --> 06:26.600
I haven't forgotten you, Bag.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.760
Duck.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.000
QUACK? QUACK!

06:30.000 --> 06:32.040
Looks like you're back on form.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.400
I'm un-knit stuck.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.400
- Thanks, Hattie!
- QUACK!

06:45.280 --> 06:47.080
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:48.920 --> 06:50.680
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:52.440 --> 06:54.280
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:56.160 --> 06:57.680
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!
