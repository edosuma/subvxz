11:22.932 --> 11:24.642
- No.
- Oh, that's terrific news.

11:24.809 --> 11:28.145
Well, then you won't mind coming by
and walking Eddie about 10:00?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.523
Forget it, Frasier.
I am not your assistant.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.191
I am a producer.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.444
A producer doesn't give up
her evenings to walk a dog.

11:35.611 --> 11:39.323
Would a senior producer
walk a dog?

11:40.991 --> 11:43.327
Well, someone has gotta walk
this damn dog.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.454
All right, that's enough.

You know, when I was a cop,

12:49.935 --> 12:53.063
we used to make fun
of security guards.

on a possible perv at the Kmart.
