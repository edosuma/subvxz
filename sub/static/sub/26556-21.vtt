Roy! Roy!
Roy, stop it!

00:04.455 --> 00:05.620
[clang]

00:05.697 --> 00:07.122
Dinah: they're dead.

00:07.199 --> 00:09.041
Oliver: we have to
protect him.

00:09.117 --> 00:10.459
Dinah: yeah.
As far as the scpd is concerned,

00:10.535 --> 00:12.461
emiko is the one who
killed those guards.

00:12.537 --> 00:14.212
Thank you for wiping that
security camera footage.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.715
I could not get there
before the cops did.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.058
I thought that was you.

00:18.135 --> 00:20.177
Felicity: the ninth circle
has archer.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.220
They are going to use the
intel they get from the assets

00:22.231 --> 00:25.515
to locate the dna of the
people involved in cygnus x-1.

00:25.592 --> 00:28.852
And that dna could lead them to
exactly where that weapon is.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.605
I copied archer's
root code.

00:31.681 --> 00:33.982
No. As long as
archer's out there,

00:34.059 --> 00:35.743
it could fall into the wrong
hands, and I don't know what

00:35.819 --> 00:37.736
my legacy's gonna be,
but it can't be that.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.529
Emiko: you'll die a villain
just like our father,

00:39.606 --> 00:42.324
and I will be the cause
of both of your deaths.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.534
What did you say?

00:44.611 --> 00:47.913
I had the chance to warn
our father about the gambit,

00:47.989 --> 00:49.372
that it was rigged
to explode,

00:49.449 --> 00:50.874
and I knew about it.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.584
I let our father die
because he didn't

00:52.595 --> 00:54.169
deserve to live,

00:54.246 --> 00:56.046
and neither do you.
Bye, brother.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.306

Need some help?

Tommy?

01:33.469 --> 01:35.710
Hey, ollie.

01:35.787 --> 01:37.221
It's been a while.

Dinah!

02:12.583 --> 02:14.508
Can anyone hear me?

02:14.585 --> 02:16.668
[metal creaking]

02:16.679 --> 02:19.179
John: I'm here!

02:19.256 --> 02:22.724
I'm here. Ohh!

02:22.801 --> 02:25.135
Ohh!

02:25.212 --> 02:26.395
[john groaning]

02:33.362 --> 02:34.862
You ok?

02:34.938 --> 02:37.531
I'm good.

02:37.608 --> 02:39.816
Can't say much
for my helmet.

[dinah grunting]

02:46.783 --> 02:48.783
You good?

02:48.860 --> 02:51.953
Well, my bo staff's smashed,
but other than that.

02:52.030 --> 02:54.548
- Where's rene?
- I don't know.

02:54.625 --> 02:56.291
John: rene!
Dinah: rene!

02:56.368 --> 02:59.127
John: rene!
Dinah: rene!

02:59.204 --> 03:00.721
Rene!

03:00.797 --> 03:02.047
Rene: you guys want to
get me out of here?

03:02.057 --> 03:04.391
Rene, are you
in there?

03:04.468 --> 03:05.800
He's here.
He's here.

03:05.877 --> 03:08.178
Get him out!

03:08.255 --> 03:10.397
Dinah: you ok?
John: move it.

03:10.474 --> 03:13.016
[john and roy grunting]

03:13.093 --> 03:14.568
We can't do it.

03:14.645 --> 03:16.186
Dinah: here. Hurry!

03:16.197 --> 03:17.562
- Let's try this.
- Grab it, grab it, grab it.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.148
Grab it. Dinah,
pull on 3, ok?

03:20.225 --> 03:21.650
Dinah: ok.
John: all right. Ready?

03:21.726 --> 03:23.151
Dinah: yeah.
John: 1, 2, 3. Come on!

03:23.162 --> 03:25.070
[roy and john groaning]

03:25.080 --> 03:27.414
Dinah: all right.
Come on. Agh!

03:27.491 --> 03:28.999
Got you.

03:32.496 --> 03:33.828
What the hell
just happened?

03:33.839 --> 03:35.372
Emiko just dropped
a building on us.

03:35.448 --> 03:36.873
That's what happened.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.541
We got to get
to oliver.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.252
As we lost contact,
he was chasing emiko

03:40.262 --> 03:41.929
on the floor
beneath us.

03:42.005 --> 03:43.388
- We have to get there.
- Then we better hurry.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.844
Hey. Quick. Urgent.
I need our uplink gain augmenter.

03:49.921 --> 03:51.939
Uh, more urgent,
I have something to tell you bef--

03:52.015 --> 03:53.765
Ok. Your thing is definitely
not more urgent than mine.

03:53.776 --> 03:56.059
- Welcome to my thing.
- What are they doing?

03:56.136 --> 03:57.519
Don't they remember
we're on the same side,

03:57.595 --> 03:58.895
deputized vigilantes
and everything?

03:58.972 --> 04:00.355
Well, apparently,
they have a warrant.

04:00.432 --> 04:02.023
They what?!
H-hi. Excuse me. What--

04:02.034 --> 04:03.775
An anonymous source sent
us surveillance footage

04:03.786 --> 04:06.027
of last night's incident
in the subway tunnels.

04:06.104 --> 04:08.530
Where you see
team arrow valiantly foil

04:08.606 --> 04:11.074
a terrorist attack
just like we told you?

04:11.151 --> 04:13.535
Emiko adachi didn't
kill those guards.

04:13.611 --> 04:15.462
Your friend
roy harper did.

04:15.539 --> 04:18.130
Then your whole team
lied to cover it up.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.708
That's insane.

04:19.784 --> 04:21.875
Digital forensics
also investigated

04:21.952 --> 04:23.628
that bomb, which you said was
the work of the ninth circle...

04:23.639 --> 04:25.347
- Uh-huh.
- But that file was activated

04:25.424 --> 04:27.632
from a program
called archer,

04:27.643 --> 04:29.592
a program which smoak
tech owns the patent for.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.219
Well, technically, yes,
but it was stolen.

04:31.296 --> 04:32.646
This has to be a mistake.
I mean--

04:32.723 --> 04:34.147
I agree. I know
this sounds shady,

04:34.224 --> 04:35.682
but trust me--
We are the good guys,

04:35.759 --> 04:36.975
and we are after the bad
guy--well, bad girl,

04:36.986 --> 04:38.560
who currently has
your captain

04:38.636 --> 04:40.687
and my husband trapped
under a building.

04:40.764 --> 04:42.772
We haven't received any word
about no buildings going down.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.241
That's because it was
a small detonation

04:44.318 --> 04:45.817
in a chemical plant
outside of town.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.986
Listen! You can talk
to the team all about it,

04:47.997 --> 04:49.871
but to get a hold
of them,

04:49.948 --> 04:51.498
I have to get a hold of a really
tiny, delicate piece of tech

04:51.575 --> 04:53.116
that is in that box that
lieutenant butterfingers

04:53.127 --> 04:54.576
is rummaging through.

04:54.652 --> 04:55.910
Bingsley: I'm sorry,
ms. Smoak.

04:55.987 --> 04:57.296
- You're under arrest.
- What?

04:57.372 --> 04:58.747
- You can't do that!
- Yes, I can.

04:58.823 --> 05:00.206
Turn around!

05:00.217 --> 05:04.344
Ok. Just... Let me
give my friend a hug first.

05:04.421 --> 05:05.887
Go ahead.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.716
Plug your ears.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.593
[beeping]

05:11.603 --> 05:13.020
[screeching sound]

05:13.096 --> 05:15.597
[officers screaming]

05:15.673 --> 05:18.275
[screech stops]

05:18.352 --> 05:20.018
What the hell
was that?

05:20.029 --> 05:21.686
Oh. It's part
of my new security system,

05:21.697 --> 05:23.355
a remote-detonated
nanoelectric pulse

05:23.365 --> 05:25.023
that I built
into the ceiling.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.533
Oh. Remind me to never
get on your bad side.

05:26.610 --> 05:27.776
- Is oliver ok?
- I don't know.

05:27.852 --> 05:29.110
I tried. All I got
was static,

05:29.187 --> 05:30.370
but if I can boost
the signal,

05:30.447 --> 05:31.905
I might be able
to contact them.

05:31.981 --> 05:33.406
You mean we can.
I'm not letting you

05:33.417 --> 05:35.116
do this alone.

05:35.193 --> 05:37.535
Ok. Well, then
let's get out of here.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.588
We do not want to be here
when these guys wake up.

05:41.825 --> 05:45.502
Keven:
crime, violence, anarchy.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.420
The terrible disease
that once infected

05:47.497 --> 05:49.890
the streets of the glades
has risen again,

05:49.966 --> 05:52.384
but there is a cure
to the vigilante problem

05:52.394 --> 05:55.553
and a chance
for a better, brighter future--

05:55.564 --> 05:58.723
Zeta powered
by galaxy one's archer program.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.684
They are the front lines
of a citywide initiative

06:01.761 --> 06:03.403
to end the vigilante menace

06:03.480 --> 06:08.191
and restore star city's
glory once and for all.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.235
Mia: first, galaxy one puts
a bounty on your heads.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.320
Now they're sending a damn
army of super robots after you?

06:12.397 --> 06:14.030
We are just keven dale's
scapegoats

06:14.107 --> 06:15.407
for his larger agenda.

06:15.483 --> 06:16.750
Which is what?

06:16.827 --> 06:19.160
Turn star city
into a police state,

06:19.237 --> 06:20.703
go under galaxy one's
control.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.122
We can't let
that happen.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.540
Mia: oh, yeah?
And how exactly

06:23.616 --> 06:24.833
are we supposed
to stop them?

06:24.909 --> 06:27.386
By destroying archer.

06:27.462 --> 06:29.879
Dinah: we tried that
once, remember?

06:29.956 --> 06:31.423
It didn't work then,
and archer was

06:31.433 --> 06:33.091
nowhere near as
advanced as it is now.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.768
That's why we have to
find the mad scientist

06:34.845 --> 06:37.053
who upgraded my creation
into frankenstein's monster.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.013
Roy: you sure that's
a good idea?

06:39.090 --> 06:41.933
No, but if galaxy one has an
army of archer-powered assassins,

06:41.944 --> 06:45.019
we don't stand a chance,

06:45.096 --> 06:47.781
star city loses.

06:47.858 --> 06:49.858
Well, I'll put the
word out to what's left

06:49.934 --> 06:51.192
of the canary
network,

06:51.269 --> 06:53.236
see what intel
they can find.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.071
William: you know,
if you need a quick and dirty virus,

06:55.148 --> 06:56.448
I'm sure I can whip
something up in no time.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.032
It won't work.
I've tried them all.

06:58.109 --> 06:59.459
But if the network
is still online,

06:59.536 --> 07:01.077
then they could
still track our dna,

07:01.154 --> 07:03.130
- so we need a plan "b."
- I have a plan "b!"

07:03.206 --> 07:05.915
and all of my plans
include you laying low

07:05.992 --> 07:08.251
and staying safe.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.137
Leave archer to me.

07:12.123 --> 07:13.682
Thank you.

07:18.004 --> 07:21.055
[metal creaking]

07:21.132 --> 07:22.765
You look shocked.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.152
Um, is it the beard?

07:25.228 --> 07:27.312
Uh-uh. You look good.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.897
Yeah, I know.

07:28.973 --> 07:31.992
Ohh. I must have
a really bad concussion.

07:32.068 --> 07:35.153
Yeah, man. A building
just collapsed on you.

07:35.230 --> 07:37.706
It could be a little
ptsd, too.

07:37.782 --> 07:40.658
That position that
you're in with the rebar,

07:40.669 --> 07:45.205
it is remarkably similar to how
you found me all those years ago.

07:45.281 --> 07:46.840
The night you died.

07:46.917 --> 07:48.041
Yeah.

07:48.117 --> 07:49.501
[cement falling]

07:49.511 --> 07:51.845
And I got to tell you, man,
it looks like

07:51.922 --> 07:53.630
the same thing is
gonna happen to you

07:53.706 --> 07:55.348
if you don't get out
of here, like, right now.

07:55.425 --> 07:57.017
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:57.093 --> 07:59.853
[arrow hissing]

08:14.110 --> 08:18.363
Ooh. Yeah.
That was close.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.449
Um... You think you want
to pop that thing back in?

08:21.526 --> 08:25.036
- Mm-hmm.
- Ok. 1, 2, and 3.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.505
Aah!

08:26.581 --> 08:28.498
[moans]

08:28.575 --> 08:29.874
[exhales]

08:29.885 --> 08:33.001
- That had to hurt.
- Yeah.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.672
You have oliver
angry face on right now.

08:35.748 --> 08:38.716
Just saying.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.010
[sighs]

08:41.087 --> 08:42.895
I got to get out
of here.

08:42.972 --> 08:44.973
[groans]

08:45.049 --> 08:48.851
The team might be dead.

08:48.928 --> 08:53.240
Everything we've built
with the scpd is--is gone

08:53.316 --> 08:54.899
because of emiko.

08:54.976 --> 08:56.442
I need to--I need to
get out of here.

08:56.519 --> 08:58.152
I need to find the others,

08:58.229 --> 08:59.779
and we have to stop her.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.573
Um, isn't that gonna
be kind of hard

09:01.583 --> 09:03.032
considering she's
family?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.867
She's not
my family anymore.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.411
Well, I hope you
weren't planning

09:06.487 --> 09:08.746
on using your bow
to get out of here

09:08.757 --> 09:10.674
'cause...

09:32.639 --> 09:34.447
yep.

09:34.524 --> 09:36.899
[sighs]

09:36.976 --> 09:39.902
Overwatch?
Arsenal?

09:39.979 --> 09:42.530
Does anyone copy?

09:42.607 --> 09:44.291
You know, I know that you
were worried about them,

09:44.367 --> 09:46.451
but they are pretty
resourceful people.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.411
They're probably fine.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.963
Let's hope you're right.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.748
I usually am.

09:51.824 --> 09:55.585
You know, it is insane
that we both had

09:55.662 --> 09:57.420
secret half sisters.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.088
Well, yours didn't try
to kill you, did she?

09:59.165 --> 10:00.640
Well, you should give
thea some credit.

10:00.717 --> 10:02.475
I died before she had
the chance to try.

10:05.814 --> 10:09.223
A couple specialty arrows
left, two explosive.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.559
Seems kind of risky
considering

10:11.636 --> 10:13.653
the instability
of this place,

10:13.730 --> 10:15.322
especially
without a bow.

10:15.398 --> 10:16.814
Well, there are solutions
for that.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.775
Speaking of, uh,
what about emiko?

10:18.851 --> 10:20.985
What kind of solution

10:20.996 --> 10:22.996
are you planning
for her?

10:23.073 --> 10:24.998
The one she deserves.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.077
She let our father die.

10:29.153 --> 10:31.621
He abandoned her,
oliver.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.673
She's been manipulating me,

10:33.750 --> 10:36.584
she's been manipulating
the team for months,

10:36.661 --> 10:39.846
posing as some sort
of hero.

10:39.923 --> 10:42.173
The woman's a murderer.

10:42.184 --> 10:45.259
So now you're gonna
be one, too?

10:45.336 --> 10:47.854
And here I thought that we
were done with all of that.

10:47.931 --> 10:50.640
I don't see another
choice here, tommy.

10:50.717 --> 10:53.976
It is exactly that kind
of attitude

10:54.053 --> 10:56.112
that's gonna keep you
stuck down here.

11:00.351 --> 11:02.694
[typing]

11:02.704 --> 11:04.529
Looks like your mystery
contact is as good

11:04.539 --> 11:06.280
at covering their
tracks as you are.

11:06.357 --> 11:09.325
Ugh. I know, which is
why she's so dangerous

11:09.402 --> 11:11.619
and annoying.

11:11.696 --> 11:13.955
William: so I think I finally
figured out a plan "b"

11:14.031 --> 11:17.709
to keep us hidden from archer
while we try to destroy it.

11:17.785 --> 11:20.837
Blindspots just like the one
keven dale used to mask his dna.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.505
The only way this is
going to work is

11:22.516 --> 11:23.890
if we copy the exact
root code that was used

11:23.967 --> 11:25.299
in the original.

11:25.376 --> 11:27.060
Ok. Well, how
do we do that?

11:27.137 --> 11:28.469
Well, we'd have to steal it
from keven dale's computer

11:28.546 --> 11:31.013
in his office
at galaxy one.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.724
Uh, I suppose
I could break in.

11:32.800 --> 11:36.352
No, no. I'm sorry.
Not you. Me.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.196
I mean, keven dale
already recognizes me

11:38.273 --> 11:40.857
as a fellow ceo,
and besides,

11:40.933 --> 11:42.567
I think he'd be
a lot more agreeable

11:42.577 --> 11:44.861
to me than... You.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.580
You know, a little flirty flirt
while I hack into his computer,

11:47.657 --> 11:49.666
and then we'll get
what we need.

11:49.743 --> 11:53.202
- Look. I know it's a risk.
- A big one.

11:53.279 --> 11:56.247
One I am not
willing to take.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.833
We have a plan "a."
Let's stick to it.

11:58.910 --> 12:01.377
Like I said, just
leave it to me.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.930
You know you're still
treating me like I'm 13.

12:04.007 --> 12:06.257
What do you mean?

12:06.268 --> 12:08.509
Uh, I mean that you're doing
the exact same thing to me now

12:08.586 --> 12:10.344
that you and dad did
all those years ago,

12:10.421 --> 12:12.272
leaving me out of things
and then getting rid of me.

12:12.348 --> 12:14.724
Your father and I,
we never wanted to let you go.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.351
But you did,
and then even

12:17.428 --> 12:19.228
after everything that
happened, you still stayed away

12:19.305 --> 12:22.815
like--like I wasn't even
part of this family.

12:22.892 --> 12:25.610
Mia: ooh, and I thought
we had problems. Heh.

12:25.620 --> 12:31.365
I'm just gonna go
do anything else.

12:31.442 --> 12:35.119
William, I am so sorry.

12:35.196 --> 12:38.539
I realize now that we
made a terrible mistake,

12:38.550 --> 12:42.543
a mistake that I am going to
regret for the rest of my life,

12:42.620 --> 12:44.971
but we really thought
we were protecting you.

12:47.217 --> 12:49.893
We just wanted you to
have a normal life.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.312
[computer chiming]

13:08.688 --> 13:12.156
At this rate, we won't find
oliver until sometime next week.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.991
Felicity, cutting in and out:
team arrow, do you copy?

13:14.002 --> 13:16.452
[comms beeping]

13:16.529 --> 13:17.578
Team arrow, do you copy?

13:17.655 --> 13:18.955
Overwatch,
is that you?

13:19.031 --> 13:20.957
Yes. Are you guys ok?

13:21.033 --> 13:22.416
John: you have me, roy, dinah, and rene.
We're safe.

13:22.493 --> 13:23.835
Felicity: and oliver?

13:23.911 --> 13:25.253
He was in another part
of the building.

13:25.329 --> 13:26.921
We--we haven't been
able to contact him.

13:26.998 --> 13:29.006
I'm guessing you
haven't either.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.800
No, but his comm unit is
still online and active,

13:30.877 --> 13:32.310
so if it wasn't crushed,
it means he wasn't either.

13:32.387 --> 13:33.970
Roy: we'll find him.
Felicity: I know.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.688
You guys should know
I don't know what

13:35.765 --> 13:37.690
emiko is planning,
but she gave the scpd

13:37.767 --> 13:39.517
the footage of roy
in the subway tunnels,

13:39.528 --> 13:41.027
and they think that
we are behind

13:41.104 --> 13:42.937
whatever the ninth
circle is plotting.

13:43.014 --> 13:45.523
So lying to the scpd to cover
for roy was for nothing.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.108
Not to mention
our reputations

13:47.184 --> 13:48.359
and everything
we built this year.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.538
Yeah. Let's move.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.455
You've always been good
at this kind of thing.

14:01.532 --> 14:03.374
Remember when we
were kids

14:03.385 --> 14:06.502
and you learned how to
hotwire my dad's car?

14:06.579 --> 14:09.547
Well, I got grounded
for an entire summer.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.599
Yeah, because you
did it 3 more times.

14:20.068 --> 14:23.236
Then it's a good thing

14:23.313 --> 14:25.238
I should only have to
do this once.

14:25.315 --> 14:26.531
[draws bow]

14:34.398 --> 14:36.791
Uh-huh. You might only
be making this worse.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.589
All the work we've
done to prove ourselves

14:42.665 --> 14:45.750
to the cops,
to the city.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.085
Poof! It's
just gone.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.096
- Along with my job.
- We don't know that.

14:50.173 --> 14:52.757
All we know is that
emiko tried to set us up.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.217
Yeah. She lied about us being
behind the ninth circle attacks,

14:55.294 --> 14:59.597
but she was telling the truth
about us covering up those murders.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.265
We never should
have done that.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.850
Wait. Even if it meant
roy going to prison?

15:02.927 --> 15:04.110
Two people were murdered.

15:04.187 --> 15:06.946
I'm gonna turn
myself in.

15:07.023 --> 15:08.773
Roy: it's the only way.
John: no, you're not.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.783
You've already taken the
fall for us once, roy.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.401
Let us help you
this time.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.070
And because of that,
everything you've worked for

15:14.146 --> 15:16.456
is at risk.

15:16.532 --> 15:19.283
He's right. I'm sorry,
but the scpd

15:19.294 --> 15:20.910
has already tried
to arrest felicity.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.620
It's better one of us
takes the fall

15:22.631 --> 15:24.297
than the rest of us spends
our lives as fugitives.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.633
While we're arguing,
emiko's out there planning.

15:26.709 --> 15:28.918
We need to get out
of here and stop her.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.628
[metal creaking,
cement breaking]

15:30.639 --> 15:32.213
Oh, that can't be good.

15:32.289 --> 15:33.848
John: move, move, move!
Go, go, go, go!

15:39.147 --> 15:40.763
All right. Is
everybody all right?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.598
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.725
- Now the lights come on.
- Uh, guys, if the lights

15:44.802 --> 15:46.769
just came on, that means the
emergency generator just came on.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.479
- That's a good thing, right?
- Normally, yeah,

15:48.490 --> 15:50.156
but the building you're in
used to manufacture

15:50.233 --> 15:52.316
some very flammable
chemicals,

15:52.327 --> 15:54.068
and flammable chemicals plus
sparks equals really big boom.

15:54.145 --> 15:56.112
- Ok. What about oliver?
- If you don't turn off

15:56.122 --> 15:57.947
the generator soon,
there's gonna be no oliver to find.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.333
The entire building's gonna go
up in flames, and you with it.

16:00.410 --> 16:01.751
All right.
Let's keep moving.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.793
Felicity, we're in
the boiler room.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.461
[loud rattling]

16:12.538 --> 16:14.171
Rene: ok. Please tell me
that's not the generator.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.841
Well, if it sounds like a sick
dinosaur, it probably is.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.467
Good news is we still
have about 8 minutes

16:18.544 --> 16:20.094
before it incinerates
the whole building.

16:20.171 --> 16:21.929
And where is it exactly?

16:22.006 --> 16:23.639
Lower level,
to your left.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.434
[clattering]

16:26.510 --> 16:28.019
Dinah: what do we
think that is?

16:28.029 --> 16:29.979
Roy: c6h6.
Alena: benzene.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.355
Guys, that is
really bad stuff.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.524
- How bad?
- Try irreparable nerve damage

16:33.535 --> 16:35.151
with severe convulsions
and a painful death.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.694
But the good news is
it's heavier than air,

16:36.705 --> 16:38.779
so you are safe
on the mezzanine. Heh.

16:38.856 --> 16:40.865
Roy: and the bad news is that
generator is not on the mezzanine.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.834
Neither is oliver.

16:42.910 --> 16:45.036
The ground beneath your feet is
airtight, so it can't get to him.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.829
Well, I prefer my friends alive,
so we're gonna have to find

16:46.906 --> 16:48.840
a new way to get you
to the generator and fast.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.348
Again, I would like
to point out

17:06.425 --> 17:09.068
how structurally unsound
this building appears to be,

17:09.145 --> 17:12.855
so maybe upping the payload
is not the best idea.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.815
It's a risk
I have to take.

17:14.892 --> 17:16.525
This is it.
After this, I'm out of options.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.912
Are you, or is this
just typical oliver?

17:19.989 --> 17:22.749
Now come on, man.
Don't you ever wonder

17:22.825 --> 17:25.576
why you keep finding yourself
in positions like this

17:25.587 --> 17:28.412
where things just keep
getting worse?

17:28.423 --> 17:32.374
I'm here for one reason
and one reason only--emiko.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.045
Right. Emiko,
your half sister.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.506
Her being my half sister
doesn't matter.

17:38.582 --> 17:41.759
What matters is finding
her and stopping her

17:41.770 --> 17:44.011
before she hurts
anyone else.

17:44.088 --> 17:45.679
It's a strategy you
should appreciate.

17:45.756 --> 17:47.681
Why? Because of what
my father did to the glades?

17:47.758 --> 17:49.942
No, tommy, because
of what he did to you!

17:54.974 --> 17:58.951
Any idea what it's
like to--to--

17:59.028 --> 18:03.906
To run a scenario through
your head a million times,

18:03.983 --> 18:07.535
just wondering
if you could've just

18:07.611 --> 18:13.791
listened to me
a little bit sooner,

18:13.802 --> 18:17.378
but you didn't because
you were blinded

18:17.454 --> 18:19.847
by the fact that
he was your father.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.436
Maybe you'd still be
alive today.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.432
But I didn't listen,

18:30.509 --> 18:33.227
and I didn't make
the right choice,

18:33.304 --> 18:36.230
at least not
until it was too late,

18:36.307 --> 18:40.317
because I was stuck,
oliver, in my own cycle,

18:40.328 --> 18:43.279
my father's cycle,
just like you are

18:43.355 --> 18:45.614
and just like you
will continue to be

18:45.691 --> 18:48.000
if you don't
break free.

18:50.029 --> 18:53.714
No. No. You're wrong.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.252
This isn't about me.

18:58.329 --> 19:00.513
This is not
about my father.

19:00.590 --> 19:03.683
This is about emiko,

19:03.759 --> 19:06.686
and the choices that
she made,

19:06.762 --> 19:09.263
they are on her.

19:09.340 --> 19:11.440
[metal creaking]

19:23.229 --> 19:27.540
Overwatch, any luck figuring
out that alternate approach?

19:27.617 --> 19:28.991
Felicity: looks like there's
a room behind the generator

19:29.068 --> 19:30.826
with a failsafe switch.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.295
The air ducts should be
able to get you in there.

19:36.242 --> 19:39.552
All right. Yeah. Looks like we're
gonna have to crawl there fast.

19:39.629 --> 19:40.761
John: yeah.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.562
We'll never
make it in time.

19:52.424 --> 19:55.351
John: roy, no!
Dinah: roy, no!

19:55.427 --> 19:58.020
Roy, if you breathe that stuff
in, you're dead.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.405
I know.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.582
Stop! We'll find
another way!

20:11.419 --> 20:13.336
There's not enough time.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.430
No!

20:24.507 --> 20:26.173
Please don't tell me
he just went in there!

20:26.250 --> 20:27.841
Overwatch, tell me
how much time he has.

20:27.918 --> 20:29.435
10 seconds,
maybe 12.

20:29.512 --> 20:31.479
Roy, I'm gonna need
a sitrep. Talk to me, roy!

20:33.683 --> 20:36.108
John: roy? Roy!

20:41.307 --> 20:42.823
[generator stops]

20:47.455 --> 20:50.739
He did it.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.909
He did it.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.253
He did it.

21:05.956 --> 21:07.381
[gasps]

21:07.458 --> 21:08.757
Dinah: oh!
John: roy!

21:08.834 --> 21:10.393
Oh. Come on.

21:15.149 --> 21:18.267
Are you ok?

21:18.344 --> 21:20.561
John: overwatch,
power's off.

21:20.637 --> 21:22.280
We're headed out
to find oliver.

21:24.975 --> 21:26.826
Copy that.

21:26.902 --> 21:29.778
I don't know how you
ever breathe on this job.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.497
I don't.

21:31.574 --> 21:32.832
Come on, oliver.
Where are you?

21:32.908 --> 21:35.826
[creaking]

21:35.837 --> 21:38.495
Hey. Um, random question.

21:38.506 --> 21:42.833
Did you add another hero
to your justice league?

21:42.844 --> 21:45.336
You I expected.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.346
Too bad for your friend.

21:47.423 --> 21:48.881
Please don't.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.841
I thought you'd be
eager to join you husband.

21:50.918 --> 21:54.094
Please don't kill me!
I'm pregnant!

21:54.171 --> 21:57.598
This baby
is innocent

21:57.674 --> 22:01.977
just like you were when
robert left your family.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.530
Please don't kill
an innocent child.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.528
Good to know.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.788
Aah!

22:16.402 --> 22:18.044
[breathing heavily]

22:25.795 --> 22:28.670
[groans]

22:28.747 --> 22:30.681
I think the concrete
gives up.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.560
I need to get out of here.

22:34.637 --> 22:37.054
You will. Trust me.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.555
What you really need
to worry about

22:38.566 --> 22:40.149
is what happens
when you do.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.573
- Why?
- Everything you've done

22:47.650 --> 22:49.566
this year--working
with the cops,

22:49.577 --> 22:51.402
fighting for the city
without a mask--

22:51.412 --> 22:54.747
You've got a shot at
something we never had.

22:54.824 --> 22:56.865
What's that?

22:56.942 --> 22:59.251
A clean slate.

22:59.328 --> 23:02.329
You can't shed your past,
but you can keep it

23:02.406 --> 23:04.039
from hurting your kids.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.542
That's something our
parents could never give us,

23:06.618 --> 23:11.004
but it is never, ever
going to happen, oliver,

23:11.081 --> 23:13.432
if you keep seeing red
with emiko.

23:13.509 --> 23:16.718
As long as she's
still breathing,

23:16.795 --> 23:18.437
my family will never
be safe.

23:18.514 --> 23:20.439
You know this, tommy.

23:20.516 --> 23:24.059
Then you haven't moved past
your family's mistakes, oliver.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.687
You haven't broken
the cycle of lies and hate.

23:26.763 --> 23:28.814
You're trapped.
You're trapped

23:28.891 --> 23:30.783
just like you are
in this room.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.113
But you're not here.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.240
You are a--

23:38.317 --> 23:41.034
You are a figment
of my imagination

23:41.111 --> 23:45.247
that has been sent here
to test my resolve.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.800
Won't work.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.513
[rumbling]

23:57.311 --> 23:59.103
Looks like you found
your way out.

24:08.656 --> 24:12.441
To stop emiko,
if I need to be

24:12.518 --> 24:16.653
as ruthless to her
as she was to my father,

24:16.664 --> 24:18.372
so be it.

24:20.150 --> 24:23.619
Good luck finding
your team, oliver.

24:23.695 --> 24:25.171
You're gonna need them.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.426
Good-bye, tommy.

24:36.926 --> 24:38.851
Comms just
dropped off.

24:38.928 --> 24:40.802
Yeah. We should be
getting closer to oliver.

24:40.879 --> 24:42.855
Dinah: you need a minute?
Roy: no.

24:42.932 --> 24:46.266
Ugh! Yeah. Ok.
Maybe I do.

24:46.343 --> 24:47.693
Why don't you guys
go ahead,

24:47.770 --> 24:49.102
find us a way
downstairs?

24:49.179 --> 24:50.362
We'll catch up.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.696
You must be
a pretty big idiot,

24:59.707 --> 25:01.281
risking your life
like that.

25:01.358 --> 25:02.866
Well, we're alive,
aren't we?

25:02.943 --> 25:06.119
You're lucky to be.

25:06.196 --> 25:08.756
I'm surprised you even care
if I made it out alive or not.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.886
Of course I care.

25:13.963 --> 25:16.055
You're our teammate.

25:16.131 --> 25:18.390
Maybe I shouldn't be.

25:18.467 --> 25:20.300
You lost everything
to protect me,

25:20.377 --> 25:22.135
and you don't
even know me.

25:22.212 --> 25:24.230
Those guards that
I killed,

25:24.306 --> 25:26.139
they're innocent.

25:26.216 --> 25:28.183
They had families.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.311
What you did back there,

25:31.388 --> 25:33.480
it was awful,

25:33.557 --> 25:35.148
but we all know
it was the bloodlust, roy.

25:35.225 --> 25:36.817
That wasn't you.

25:36.893 --> 25:38.735
No. That doesn't
change the fact that

25:38.746 --> 25:41.697
I put everyone else
around me at risk.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.457
You should have just
let me go to prison.

25:47.613 --> 25:51.415
I was wrong.
We all make mistakes.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.759
I was just pissed because
we had just lost everything.

25:53.836 --> 25:55.419
That doesn't mean
I want you dead.

25:55.429 --> 25:58.880
Maybe it's best if
I am 6 feet under.

25:58.957 --> 26:02.509
Dying is the coward's
way out.

26:02.586 --> 26:04.386
Every day that you
stay alive,

26:04.463 --> 26:05.762
you try to redeem
yourself

26:05.773 --> 26:08.682
for that messed-up
thing you did

26:08.759 --> 26:12.945
because this world
is a better place

26:13.022 --> 26:15.939
with a hero like you.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.950
Now let's go.

26:27.486 --> 26:29.536
Bunker is clear
and secure.

26:29.613 --> 26:30.954
- You ok?
- Yeah. Doesn't seem to be

26:30.965 --> 26:32.956
any permanent damage.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.249
Just rebooting
the system,

26:34.326 --> 26:35.876
get the comms
up and running,

26:35.952 --> 26:37.419
and then I'm gonna check
to see if oliver's ok.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.212
Just let me repeat.
You. Are you ok?

26:39.289 --> 26:41.307
Almost dying? Nothing I
haven't done 100 times before.

26:41.383 --> 26:42.975
- Am I right?
- Well, the first time you've

26:43.052 --> 26:44.801
done it when it's
not just you.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.386
Sadly, no.

26:46.463 --> 26:48.096
William, the poor kid,
I mean, all he ever wanted

26:48.173 --> 26:50.265
was a normal life--

26:50.342 --> 26:54.486
Loses his mom,
gets kidnapped way too many times,

26:54.563 --> 26:57.773
the final straw-- being taken
hostage by a serial killer.

26:57.849 --> 27:00.901
I mean, how's life gonna be
any different for this kid?

27:00.977 --> 27:02.611
You'll make it
different.

27:02.688 --> 27:05.155
You know, you make
that sound so easy.

27:05.232 --> 27:08.241
Growing up,
my parents,

27:08.318 --> 27:11.670
it's just that they
made my life miserable,

27:11.747 --> 27:14.581
and I promised myself
that I would do better

27:14.658 --> 27:16.175
when I became
a parent, that I would--

27:16.251 --> 27:19.252
I would--I would
just be better,

27:19.329 --> 27:23.507
and I imagined this-- this--this
life, and this is not it.

27:23.517 --> 27:28.762
I mean, somehow, I've
done something worse,

27:28.839 --> 27:31.765
and I've created
this life where I--

27:31.842 --> 27:34.309
I can't even keep
my children safe.

27:34.386 --> 27:37.521
Hey. At smoak tech,
you defended yourself like a badass.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.107
You will find a way
to protect those kids.

27:40.183 --> 27:41.659
- How?
- Think of it like

27:41.735 --> 27:43.110
a computer program.

27:43.186 --> 27:44.536
How do you secure
a system?

27:44.613 --> 27:46.780
You get a really good
firewall,

27:46.857 --> 27:48.448
and you take it offline.

27:48.525 --> 27:50.542
I can't exactly take my
entire life off the grid.

27:50.619 --> 27:51.827
Well, why not?

27:51.903 --> 27:53.212
I have a company
for one.

27:53.288 --> 27:55.372
Well, luckily, you have
a fantastic cto

27:55.383 --> 27:57.999
who can run it
for you.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.710
You want a different
life for this kid, right?

27:59.720 --> 28:02.838
- Yes.
- Well, then

28:02.914 --> 28:06.299
you're gonna need to do
something different this time.

28:06.376 --> 28:07.851
Yeah.

28:10.139 --> 28:14.066
Keven:
crime, violence, anarchy.

28:14.143 --> 28:15.851
The terrible disease
that once infected

28:15.927 --> 28:18.404
the streets of the glades
has risen again,

28:18.480 --> 28:20.906
but there is a cure
to the vigilante problem

28:20.983 --> 28:22.524
and a chance
for a better...

28:22.601 --> 28:24.025
Thought you were supposed
to go with felicity

28:24.102 --> 28:26.153
in case her friend
needed convincing.

28:26.229 --> 28:28.196
She took roy instead.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.991
Guess she's trying
to protect me, too.

28:31.067 --> 28:32.701
You know, if you're trying
to make me feel better

28:32.778 --> 28:35.537
about being abandoned
by our parents,

28:35.614 --> 28:37.205
just don't.

28:37.282 --> 28:38.924
Fine. Have your
little pity party

28:39.001 --> 28:40.375
because mom
benched you.

28:40.452 --> 28:41.835
You know that's not
what this is about.

28:41.912 --> 28:43.336
Then what is it about?

28:43.413 --> 28:45.046
When we rescued her
from galaxy one,

28:45.123 --> 28:46.932
mom apologized,
you guys seemed cool.

28:47.009 --> 28:49.259
Yeah. I thought
we were, too,

28:49.270 --> 28:51.937
but she's still pushing me
away just like she always has.

28:52.014 --> 28:54.606
Ok. Fine.
So maybe she wasn't there for you

28:54.683 --> 28:56.775
in the traditional
sense,

28:56.852 --> 28:59.853
but mom made sure that
your company was a success.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.480
She was trying.

29:01.556 --> 29:04.566
I didn't need
her money, mia.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.985
I needed a mother.

29:07.062 --> 29:08.454
To this day, felicity
still hasn't told me

29:08.530 --> 29:10.739
why she kept me out
of her life for so long

29:10.816 --> 29:15.368
or... Why she wanted
no part of mine.

29:15.445 --> 29:17.463
[sighs]

29:17.539 --> 29:23.210
Look. When I first found
out mom was keeping secrets,

29:23.286 --> 29:26.305
that she was still
being a vigilante,

29:26.381 --> 29:29.141
I didn't wallow and
feel sorry for myself.

29:29.218 --> 29:32.811
I confronted her,
demanded answers.

29:32.888 --> 29:34.480
Maybe it's time
you do the same.

29:40.136 --> 29:41.236
[watch chimes]

29:48.478 --> 29:49.986

29:49.997 --> 29:52.739
John: oliver!

29:52.816 --> 29:55.709
Dinah: oh.
Thank god!

29:55.786 --> 29:57.169
John: let's keep moving.

30:01.842 --> 30:04.626
We're lucky this is
still standing.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.336
- Which way?
- East.

30:06.347 --> 30:08.505
Felicity said it was
the best way out.

30:08.516 --> 30:11.508
Emiko: oh.
It definitely is.

30:11.585 --> 30:13.101
Hi, brother.

30:21.511 --> 30:23.436
Emiko, you have
one last chance

30:23.513 --> 30:25.063
to stand down!

30:25.140 --> 30:28.367
Funny, I was gonna
say the same to you.

30:28.443 --> 30:29.743
Hyah!

31:01.927 --> 31:03.643
This place is
about to explode!

31:03.720 --> 31:05.186
Oliver, we have to
go now!

31:05.263 --> 31:06.780
Not without her!

31:09.768 --> 31:11.243
Oliver, now!

31:13.772 --> 31:16.248
- It's over.
- Is it?

31:16.325 --> 31:18.041
I know
about your baby.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.300
[arrow clatters]

31:43.093 --> 31:45.018
Your family's
gonna die.

31:45.095 --> 31:46.570
I made sure of it.

31:48.974 --> 31:51.909
Oliver, don't.

32:18.887 --> 32:21.054
[gasping]

32:21.131 --> 32:23.473

32:23.484 --> 32:25.183

32:43.170 --> 32:45.829

Oliver!

32:47.532 --> 32:49.791
[gasps]

32:49.868 --> 32:51.960
What was that?

32:52.037 --> 32:54.129
How would I know?

32:54.205 --> 32:56.515
I'm just a figment
of your imagination...

32:59.669 --> 33:03.471
But if I had to guess,

33:03.548 --> 33:07.359
I'd say it's a reminder
of what it feels like.

33:07.436 --> 33:11.187
Seeing my loved ones die?

33:11.198 --> 33:15.608
Seeing my family
be threatened?

33:15.685 --> 33:21.373
What about that don't
I already know? God.

33:21.450 --> 33:23.616
Well, then you know
exactly what it feels like

33:23.693 --> 33:25.368
to be your father.

33:25.379 --> 33:28.288
[exhales]

33:28.364 --> 33:31.666
The fear, how that
leads to vengeance,

33:31.743 --> 33:33.385
how that leads
to cruelty.

33:33.462 --> 33:35.387
It's why he abandoned
emiko.

33:35.464 --> 33:37.547
It is why she is
trying to kill you now.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.799
Look, oliver.
I know that you think

33:39.810 --> 33:41.217
that you have broken
your father's cycle,

33:41.228 --> 33:43.595
but as long as you are
giving in

33:43.605 --> 33:47.232
to your worst impulses,
you are never going to be free.

33:47.309 --> 33:49.976
What am I supposed
to do?

33:50.053 --> 33:53.354
Just tell me what
I'm supposed to do.

33:53.431 --> 33:57.734
Lean in to the best
parts of yourself--

33:57.745 --> 34:01.863
Your loyalty,
your selflessness,

34:01.940 --> 34:04.991
your courage,
your compassion,

34:05.068 --> 34:08.911
and show that side
to emiko.

34:08.922 --> 34:13.666
You are living proof
that people can change,

34:13.743 --> 34:17.378
and you have got to find a
way to see that in her, too.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.922
I don't know
if I can.

34:19.998 --> 34:24.552
That's ok. That's the risk
you got to take.

34:24.629 --> 34:26.387

in there!

but I'm always
with you.

It's time to wake up now.

[snaps fingers]

34:54.467 --> 34:57.469
[crash]

34:57.546 --> 34:59.379
Rene: hey!
He's over here!

34:59.455 --> 35:02.974
Roy: you ok?
Dinah: we're gonna get you out.

35:03.051 --> 35:05.143
John: I thought we lost
you there for a second.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.645
Yeah, so did i.

35:16.398 --> 35:18.898
Oh, thank god
you're alive.

35:18.975 --> 35:21.234
Hey. Are you and the--
Are you ok?

35:21.311 --> 35:22.819
Yeah. Yeah,
we're fine.

35:22.830 --> 35:24.779
Emiko did pay us
a visit, though.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.239
Emiko was here?

35:26.316 --> 35:28.074
Guess she left
without killing you.

35:28.151 --> 35:29.617
- You got off easy.
- Yeah. Too easy.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.286
She must have been
after something else.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.505
- Our thoughts exactly.
- Yeah, but we checked,

35:33.582 --> 35:35.132
and the only things missing are
a few arrows from the armory.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.916
Why would she need
oliver's arrows

35:36.993 --> 35:38.626
if we already got blamed for
the attack at the subway?

35:38.703 --> 35:40.137
She must have had
something else planned.

35:40.213 --> 35:42.297
Yeah, but emiko thinks
she killed us.

35:42.373 --> 35:44.257
How could she pin a second attack
against a group of dead vigilantes?

35:44.334 --> 35:45.842
Well, the public doesn't
know that you're dead yet.

35:45.919 --> 35:48.136
Just got an apb.
Green arrow sighted

35:48.213 --> 35:50.013
outside of scpd,
shots fired.

35:50.023 --> 35:51.639
At least now we know
what she was after.

35:51.716 --> 35:53.066
Rene: oliver,
we walk in there,

35:53.143 --> 35:55.310
we're going in
as wanted criminals.

35:55.386 --> 35:57.487
Let's gear back up.
We've got to move fast.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.446
Ah. William,
right on time.

36:06.522 --> 36:08.707
After our last meeting,
I'd hoped to hear from you again,

36:08.783 --> 36:10.533
but I never expected
it to be so soon.

36:10.544 --> 36:11.951
Well, you know
what they say--

36:12.028 --> 36:13.328
Strike while
the iron's hot.

36:13.404 --> 36:14.787
- Ha!
- Heh heh heh.

36:14.864 --> 36:16.372
I hope you don't mind,

36:16.383 --> 36:17.874
but I was so excited
when you said you

36:17.951 --> 36:19.834
wanted to discuss
our zeta program

36:19.911 --> 36:24.055
that I invited the man who
inspired it to join us.

36:24.132 --> 36:25.840
Mr. Harris.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.051
Mayor ramirez. Heh.

36:28.127 --> 36:30.220
You two know each other?

36:30.296 --> 36:32.305
By reputation.

36:32.382 --> 36:35.975
I bought harris consolidated
the day of its ipo.

36:36.052 --> 36:39.187
- Smart man.
- Well, we've done well enough.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.239
Speaking of
my profit margins,

36:41.316 --> 36:42.815
who do I have to
sleep with to get

36:42.892 --> 36:44.192
harris consolidated in
on those zetas?

36:44.269 --> 36:46.194
[coughs]

36:46.271 --> 36:48.988
I mean, your commercial
was impressive,

36:49.065 --> 36:50.823
but stopping vigilantes?

36:50.900 --> 36:52.742
It's microthinking.

36:52.753 --> 36:54.744
If you really want this
program to be profitable,

36:54.755 --> 36:56.588
you have to think macro.

36:56.665 --> 36:58.915
I mean, imagine what
an army of zetas

36:58.926 --> 37:01.259
could do
on a grander scale,

37:01.336 --> 37:03.878
and with harris
consolidated's global reach,

37:03.955 --> 37:07.423
why, galaxy one could change
more than just star city.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.050
It could change
the world.

37:09.127 --> 37:13.104
[tablet chimes]

37:13.181 --> 37:15.014
If you'll excuse me
a moment, gentlemen,

37:15.091 --> 37:17.058
something's come up which
requires my immediate attention.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.652
Of course.

37:23.617 --> 37:25.566
Have you lost
your damn mind?

37:25.643 --> 37:27.277
You nearly blew
my cover.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.787
I'm sorry. It was a
calculated risk I had to take

37:28.863 --> 37:30.655
to access dale's files.

37:30.732 --> 37:32.207
Is that why you've been
checking your watch?

37:32.284 --> 37:33.500
You've been hacking
him this whole time?

37:33.576 --> 37:35.368
And now I have
his blindspot code.

37:35.445 --> 37:37.870
We should get out of here
before dale figures that out.

37:37.947 --> 37:41.124
Keven: seems I
already have, Mr. Harris,

37:41.134 --> 37:43.167
or do you prefer clayton?

37:43.178 --> 37:44.794
Such a pleasure
to finally meet the son

37:44.805 --> 37:47.880
of oliver queen
and felicity smoak.

37:47.957 --> 37:49.933
As for you, Mr. Mayor,

37:50.010 --> 37:52.552
I'm afraid we've reached the
end of your political career.

37:52.628 --> 37:54.020
Seize them.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.830
So you're the fool
who's responsible

38:11.906 --> 38:13.698
for this whole
archer mess.

38:13.709 --> 38:16.993
You're the kid felicity
went into hiding for.

38:17.004 --> 38:19.037
I can see you got a
lot of your mom in you.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.172
Well, that's not all you're
gonna see if you don't step back.

38:21.249 --> 38:24.292
Felicity: alena has agreed
to help us destroy archer

38:24.303 --> 38:26.252
for real this time,
isn't that right?

38:26.329 --> 38:27.587
Well, now that you've
frozen my bank account

38:27.663 --> 38:28.963
and shredded
my passport,

38:29.040 --> 38:30.390
yes, I have.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.182
I'm sorry
about your canaries.

38:39.258 --> 38:41.309
I never meant for archer
to be used like that.

38:41.386 --> 38:44.604
And how exactly did you
mean for it to be used

38:44.680 --> 38:46.481
after you stole it
from smoak tech

38:46.557 --> 38:48.199
and sold it
to galaxy one?

38:48.276 --> 38:51.027
It started as a
software licensing deal

38:51.038 --> 38:53.446
till keven dale turned it
into a hostile takeover.

38:53.523 --> 38:55.656
Once he had archer,
he threatened to use it to hunt

38:55.667 --> 38:57.542
and kill everyone I loved
unless I disappeared,

38:57.619 --> 39:00.703
so that's what
I did

39:00.714 --> 39:02.789
to protect them.

39:02.865 --> 39:05.375
Roy: why don't you get
to work taking down archer,

39:05.385 --> 39:08.920
so we can all come
out of hiding?

39:08.996 --> 39:11.056
I guess 3 genius brains
are better than 1.

39:11.132 --> 39:14.967
Speaking of geniuses,
where is william?

39:15.044 --> 39:18.304
Mia: I spoke to him right
after you and roy left.

39:18.381 --> 39:19.680
Oh. Where the hell is he?

39:19.691 --> 39:22.183
[typing rapidly]

39:22.260 --> 39:23.818
Mom, what's wrong?

39:23.895 --> 39:25.395
That sequence that
william ran

39:25.405 --> 39:27.405
to steal keven dale's
blindspot code,

39:27.482 --> 39:29.482
I think he used it.

39:29.559 --> 39:31.242
How? I thought you said he could
only use it if he actually went--

39:31.319 --> 39:33.828
Frak!

39:33.905 --> 39:35.663
Zeta: by the authority
of galaxy one,

39:35.740 --> 39:37.290
you are under arrest.

39:43.281 --> 39:44.756
Oh, my god.
It's a slaughter.

39:46.784 --> 39:48.760
[bingsley wheezing]

39:51.289 --> 39:53.005
What happened?

39:53.082 --> 39:55.341
I thought it was you.

39:55.418 --> 39:58.761
Somebody dressed like you stole
the weapon from the subway.

39:58.838 --> 40:00.054
Spread out and find
emiko.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.356
John: wild dog, on me.

40:09.932 --> 40:11.190
Hyah!

40:11.267 --> 40:12.450
Raah!

40:21.486 --> 40:23.744
Oliver: hyah! Aah!

40:23.821 --> 40:26.256
Emiko!

40:26.332 --> 40:27.882
You just refuse
to die.

40:36.092 --> 40:39.644
Emiko has the weapon,
and she's up on the roof.

40:39.721 --> 40:43.022
Copy that.
We'll meet you there.

40:43.099 --> 40:45.817
Oliver: emiko, stop!

40:48.513 --> 40:51.606
Don't make me
do this.

40:51.682 --> 40:54.817
You are supposed
to be dead,

40:54.828 --> 40:56.944
but this will be
even better.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.614
You can watch me burn
your city to the ground.

40:59.690 --> 41:03.743
Haven't you seen
enough death?

41:03.819 --> 41:08.664
Your mother,
our father.

41:08.675 --> 41:11.751
I want you to be
better than him.

41:11.827 --> 41:14.670
I want you to help me--

41:14.681 --> 41:17.015
Help me end our family's
cycle of violence.

41:17.091 --> 41:19.225
We are not family.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.898
Do it. Kill me.

41:28.937 --> 41:30.403
No.

41:32.848 --> 41:35.366
[click, beeping]

41:42.233 --> 41:44.042
She has
the weapon.

41:44.118 --> 41:46.285
Roy: and we have no idea
where she's gonna use it.

41:46.362 --> 41:48.371
John: we'll find her.
Rene: guys, we got company.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.164
Man on p.a.: this is scpd
aerial support.

41:50.241 --> 41:51.874
Hold your positions.

41:51.951 --> 41:53.218
[sirens]

42:20.062 --> 42:21.371
Man: greg, move your head.
