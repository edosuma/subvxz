11:06.666 --> 11:08.418
Why does every boy
leave me?

11:08.626 --> 11:10.469
Pfft, who cares?
Boys are the worst.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.762
You shouldn't get
hung up, man.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.806
Maybe I come on
too strong, you know?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.179
Well, what's
your opener?

11:15.383 --> 11:16.305
Pretend I'm a boy.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.763
Mmm, testosterone.
( spits )

11:20.889 --> 11:23.187
( loudly) Hi. I'm Mabel!
I'm 12 and own a pig!

11:23.391 --> 11:24.643
Wanna get married?!

11:24.851 --> 11:27.821
( laughs )
Honestly? That was perfect.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.819
You should just
forget about guys, man.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.614
Wendy, that's it.
Forget about guys.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.826
I just need to type
"summer romances" into this thing,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.998
and I won't feel
bad about them anymore.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.169
Whoa, hold up, Mabel. We don't
even know what that thing does.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.620
You could accidentally
erase, like,

11:43.828 --> 11:46.047
learning to read
or breathe or...

11:46.247 --> 11:48.124
Or one of those
terrible summer songs

11:48.333 --> 11:49.801
you can't get
out of your head?

11:51.628 --> 11:52.800
Look at all these tubes.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.556
People must've been getting their
memories erased all over town.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.843
Whoa, look at this.

12:02.013 --> 12:05.233
<i>Tell us, Robbie, what is it
that you have seen?</i>

12:05.433 --> 12:07.356
<i>So I was attacked by
this magic kung fu guy</i>

12:07.560 --> 12:09.779
<i>that was throwing, like,
balls of fire at me.</i>

12:09.979 --> 12:11.071
<i>I kicked his butt,
though.</i>

12:11.272 --> 12:12.990
<i>Robbie,
speak honestly.</i>

12:13.191 --> 12:14.818
<i>I was saved by
a 12-year-old.</i>

12:15.109 --> 12:16.861
Why are they erasing
people's memories?

12:17.070 --> 12:17.946
I still don't get it.

12:18.154 --> 12:18.950
Looky, fellers.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.245
It's those words
what people call me.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.952
Oh, dude, your memories.
We did it.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.628
Grabby grabby.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.714
( Beeping )

12:28.539 --> 12:29.665
I sot it!

12:34.045 --> 12:36.389
I don't know, Mabel. Are you really
sure this is a good idea?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.262
All ideas are good ideas.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.019
-( Loud beeping )
- Do you hear that?

12:42.971 --> 12:45.815
The alarm in my brain
is a-ringin' again. Ah!

12:47.725 --> 12:48.817
Halt! Who's there?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.191
- Oh, no!
- Run.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.989
Get back here!

12:53.606 --> 12:56.029
Oh, you've really
tarred it up now, Fiddleford.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.736
This is all your fault.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.446
Why does my beard
have a bandage?

13:00.655 --> 13:01.872
Does that even make sense?

13:02.073 --> 13:03.495
Why has no one
pointed that out?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.170
Okay, I think
we're safe.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.756
We playing
"Guess Who"?

13:10.957 --> 13:12.379
Dude, I know
it's you, Dipper.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.673
Such big, strong hands.

13:17.171 --> 13:20.516
( Chanting )

13:22.677 --> 13:24.179
You shouldn't
have come here.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.061
We do not give up
our secrets lightly.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.267
Who are you
bathrobe-wearing freaks?

13:29.475 --> 13:30.772
Why are you
doing this?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.900
What's with your creepy
British accent?

13:33.104 --> 13:36.404
Well, I suppose we are going
to erase your minds anyway.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.030
Mabel:
Toby Determined?

13:39.277 --> 13:40.244
Dipper:
Bud Gleeful?

13:40.737 --> 13:41.738
Wendy:
that farmer guy?

13:42.488 --> 13:44.286
Creepy dude who
married a woodpecker?

13:44.490 --> 13:47.118
You, too? How's that marriage
goin', by the way?

13:47.327 --> 13:48.544
Oh, great, great.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.375
( Whispering )
Not great.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.548
And you've never
met me before.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.377
And if you had,
you wouldn't remember.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.383
I am Blind Ivan,

13:57.587 --> 14:00.932
and we are the Society
of the Blind Eye.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.936
Formed many years ago
by our founder...

14:05.094 --> 14:08.064
Our founder... Does
anyone remember who he was?

14:08.598 --> 14:11.602
We've been usin' that ray on
our own brains an awful lot.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.278
Why would you do all this?
What do you have to gain?

14:14.479 --> 14:16.072
As you have
no doubt discovered,

14:16.314 --> 14:17.941
<i>Gravity Falls
is a town plagued</i>

14:18.149 --> 14:19.867
<i>with supernatural
strangeness.</i>

14:20.151 --> 14:23.280
<i>No one knew how to stop the things
that went bump in the night,</i>

14:23.488 --> 14:26.162
<i>so our founder invented
the next best thing--</i>

14:26.741 --> 14:28.869
a <i>way for us
to forget.</i>

14:29.369 --> 14:30.495
<i>We took it
upon ourselves</i>

14:30.703 --> 14:31.955
<i>to help the troubled
townsfolk</i>

14:32.163 --> 14:35.884
<i>by erasing the memories of the
strange things they've seen.</i>

14:36.084 --> 14:37.631
<i>Now the people of
Gravity Falls</i>

14:37.835 --> 14:40.088
<i>go about their lives
ignorant and happy,</i>

14:40.296 --> 14:41.593
<i>thanks to us.</i>

14:41.798 --> 14:43.471
And as a perk,
we help ourselves

14:43.674 --> 14:45.051
forget things that
trouble us.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.687
Everyone has something
they'd rather forget.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.639
In fact, your own sister

14:49.847 --> 14:51.565
was about to use
that ray on herself.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.109
Isn't that right?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.061
Mabel? Seriously?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.896
Ha-ha. Maybe.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.324
Don't you see?
This is ruining lives.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.650
What about
Old Man McGucket?

15:00.858 --> 15:02.781
He lives in a hut
and talks to animals,

15:02.985 --> 15:03.611
thanks to you.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.163
Don't you feel
bad about that?

15:05.363 --> 15:07.240
Mmm, maybe a little.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.750
But not anymore.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.753
You won't be telling anyone
else what you've learned here.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.961
Say good-bye
to your summer.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.126
Guys, if we're gonna
forget everything,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.086
I got some stuff I wanna
get off my chest.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.756
Mabel, for half the summer,
I thought your name was Maple,

15:22.964 --> 15:25.012
like the syrup.
No one corrected me.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.514
I only love
some of my stuffed animals,

15:27.718 --> 15:29.686
and the guilt
is killing me!

15:29.971 --> 15:32.724
Sometimes I use big words and
I don't actually know what they mean.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.605
I mean, I'm supposed
to be the smart guy.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.811
If I'm not the smart guy,
who am I?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.521
Okay, I'm not
actually laid back.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.402
I'm stressed,
like, 24/7.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.108
Have you met my family?

15:42.316 --> 15:44.489
(all talking at once)

15:45.486 --> 15:48.160
Oh, stop being
a bunch of babies.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.117
- Owie!
-( all gasping )

15:51.325 --> 15:52.247
all: McGucket?!

15:53.661 --> 15:55.584
I raided the mining
display for weapons.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.916
Now fight like
a hillbilly, fellers.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.386
Nobody better mess.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.173
They know too much.
Don't let them escape!

16:05.923 --> 16:08.267
Get this song
outta your head.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.887
Dysentery's gonna
get you, dawg.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.939
McGucket's
memory tube!

16:13.848 --> 16:14.974
Oh, no, you don't.

16:15.183 --> 16:15.809
( Shrieks )

16:17.477 --> 16:18.399
Mabel, catch.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.822
I'll take that,
thank you.

16:22.982 --> 16:23.778
Give it up, boy.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.202
You're no match for
the unstoppable power of...

16:28.279 --> 16:30.623
That's right, I don't wear
nothin' under my robe.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.412
Not gonna apologize
for that.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.915
Maybe y'all should apologize
for bein' a bunch of prudes.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.211
All: Eww!!

16:36.412 --> 16:38.005
Time to erase
that forever.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.796
- Give me that tube.
- Never!

16:44.378 --> 16:46.346
That memory belongs
to McGucket.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.891
The society's secrets
belong to us.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.224
End of the line.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.810
By tomorrow, this will
all seem like a bad dream.

16:59.060 --> 17:02.940
Say good-bye to
your precious memories.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.113
No!!

17:08.236 --> 17:10.614
McGucket, you took
a bullet for me.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.290
Oh! my gosh!
Are you okay?

17:14.075 --> 17:16.419
Okay as I'll ever be.
( laughs )

17:16.618 --> 17:17.290
What?

17:17.494 --> 17:21.250
Why... Isn't...
This... Working?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.922
Hit me with
your best shot, baldy.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.925
My mind's been gone
for 30-odd years.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.891
You can't break
what's already broken.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.555
Say good night,
Sally.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.484
Unhand us!

17:44.772 --> 17:47.116
It isn't so fun
being tied up, is it?

17:47.316 --> 17:49.410
- Hey, wanna draw on their faces?
- What?

17:50.027 --> 17:52.029
- Tra-la-la...
- Hey, stop that!

17:53.322 --> 17:54.414
That's not funny.

17:54.657 --> 17:55.658
It's pretty funny.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.539
It's, like,
objectively funny.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.295
We'll have our revenge.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.589
We'll never forget
what you've done.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.000
Oh, I think
you just might.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.501
Say cheese.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.132
( All protesting )

18:09.797 --> 18:12.596
Thanks for visiting the museum for
"Gold Miner Appreciation Night".

18:12.800 --> 18:15.053
Be sure to tip the gold miner
on your way out.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.435
I'm sorry,
but what's my name?

18:18.639 --> 18:19.561
Where am I?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.813
Oh, might have
overdone that one.

I'm not so sure.

<i>Very disturbing.</i>

I'm so sorry.

20:17.049 --> 20:17.720
Aw, hush.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.769
You kids helped me get my
memories back, just like you said.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.730
But did you want
those memories back?

20:23.931 --> 20:26.901
After all these years,
I finally know who I am.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.569
Maybe I messed up
in the past,

20:28.769 --> 20:29.816
but now that I seen
what happened,

20:30.020 --> 20:32.318
I can begin to put
myself together again.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.153
Still don't know
what that means.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.868
So, wait, you weren't the author,
but you worked with him.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.198
Do you remember
who he was?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.875
It's beginning
to come back,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.668
but I need more time.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.621
And reading glasses.
Heck!

20:47.872 --> 20:50.421
( Spits ) I got some
rememberin' to do.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.919
So, Mabel,
you still wanna erase

20:53.127 --> 20:55.095
those failed
summer romances?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.804
You know, no one likes
having bad memories,

21:03.012 --> 21:05.140
but maybe it's better
to remember the bad things

21:05.347 --> 21:06.189
and learn from them

21:06.390 --> 21:09.234
than to go all
denial crazy trying to forget.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.358
That's some mature
junk right there, Mabel.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.439
Yep. Miss mature.
That's me.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.691
Hey, you wanna help me
vandalize this picture

21:15.900 --> 21:17.117
of my jerky ex-crush?

21:17.318 --> 21:18.570
Ooh, yeah!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.075
Wait, let's give him
buck teeth.

21:23.908 --> 21:24.750
Hey, you know what?

21:24.950 --> 21:26.543
Going on this big adventure
actually made me get

21:26.744 --> 21:28.963
-that stupid song out of my head.
- Soos: Nice.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.166
<i>♪ Am I blanchin', girl,
we blanchin' a'</i>

21:31.373 --> 21:33.216
Oh, come on!

21:34.460 --> 21:36.087
It's all so familiar.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.218
It's almost like
I can remember.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.431
All right,
you're getting closer.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.181
Every clay,
it's getting stronger.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.978
Ha! Yes! Ah!

21:53.187 --> 21:54.655
I don't care
if it's dangerous.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.448
I don't care
how long it takes.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.616
I'm gonna pull this off,

21:57.817 --> 21:59.819
and no one's gonna
get in my way.
