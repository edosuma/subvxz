the dodger game tomorrow night.

08:40.454 --> 08:41.987
<i> That's</i> when!

Now if you don't call
your watch commander back,

do you know who's coming
down here?

08:45.459 --> 08:47.158
Do you?

08:47.160 --> 08:49.027
Doesn't read like
a suicide note.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.896
At least, not a good one.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.864
I found this cell
in his pants,

08:52.866 --> 08:54.966
but the screen's locked
and it's password-protected.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.668

the phone later.

you had to get involved

08:59.072 --> 09:01.540
in buzz's little
overreaction here,

09:01.542 --> 09:03.875
but this should not --
it was not an overreaction.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.511
My response was based on
observations of the crime scene.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.480
And when the watch commander
heard that I was

09:08.482 --> 09:10.248
with two lieutenants
from major crimes...

09:10.250 --> 09:14.252
He handed over the investigation
to us, which was the right call.

What's the victim's name?

09:15.756 --> 09:19.157
Danny egan.
I ran a background check.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.059
Only 25, and already
he's racked up

09:21.061 --> 09:23.895
a pile of d.U.I.S
and court-ordered rehabs.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.598
Now he's got
one suicide attempt

09:26.600 --> 09:28.266
and one involuntary
psych commitment.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.001
Yeah. You see, buzz?

This guy had been circling
the drain for a while,

09:32.773 --> 09:35.941

booze and pills.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.510

A busted ukulele.

09:38.512 --> 09:41.346

it's pronounced "ook-a-le-le."

the lute family --

Look, this guy was trying
to write a love song,

09:47.187 --> 09:49.554
obviously failed,
and decided to call it quits.

09:49.556 --> 09:53.191
Captain, the hotel manager said
this room is part of a block

09:53.193 --> 09:56.127

by a Mr. and Mrs. Stuart Sloan.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.063

09:58.065 --> 10:00.031
They were the couple that were
arguing when you first arrived.

What were they fighting about?

10:02.402 --> 10:04.569
Well, I-I tried to ask,
but --

10:04.571 --> 10:07.706
typical marital spat, captain.
Yammer, yammer, yammer.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.209
Captain, I found three
empty packets of epsom salt.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.245
I shudder to ask,
but how is that relevant?

a struggle.

the hair dryer.

in the bathtub.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.834

10:35.836 --> 10:38.637
It was probably meant to be,
but it didn't get the job done.

Definitely staged.
