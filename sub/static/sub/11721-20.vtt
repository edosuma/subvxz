WEBVTT

00:02.317 --> 00:03.513
(laughter)

00:03.515 --> 00:05.146
CLAY: Now, the Red Line,
now, that was a great beat.

00:05.148 --> 00:06.387
Oh, no, that was incredible.

00:06.389 --> 00:08.760
We could park ourselves
on one of them trains, boy,

00:08.762 --> 00:10.460
him and me, plainclothes.

00:10.462 --> 00:11.596
Whew! Make what?

00:11.598 --> 00:12.931
Two, three collars
a night?

00:12.933 --> 00:14.200
It wasn't even fair.

00:14.202 --> 00:16.027
It was like shooting fish
in a barrel.

00:16.030 --> 00:17.162
(laughs)

00:17.164 --> 00:18.994
To the Red Line.
Yes, sir, to the Red!

00:18.996 --> 00:20.865
To the Red Line.
To the Red.

00:20.867 --> 00:22.266
Oh, incoming.

00:22.268 --> 00:23.532
DIANE: Mmm, what's this,
more crab legs?

00:23.534 --> 00:25.975
Mm-mm, poke-- now,
you're gonna love this.

00:25.977 --> 00:27.439
Is that that raw stuff?
Mm-mm.

00:27.441 --> 00:29.542
Yes, sir. So fresh, might
still have a hook in it.

00:29.544 --> 00:30.846
Uh, I'll pass.

00:30.848 --> 00:32.752
Mmm!
Mmm.

00:32.753 --> 00:33.983
Mmm.

00:33.985 --> 00:35.415
GROVER: Right?
RENEE: Oh, right?

00:35.417 --> 00:36.487
It's out of control.

00:36.489 --> 00:38.950
Babe, you have got to try this.

00:40.191 --> 00:42.291
GROVER: Go ahead, man.
Oh, come on.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.923
Come on, you can't eat pizza
your whole life.

00:43.925 --> 00:45.723
Can't get food
like this in Chicago.

00:45.725 --> 00:48.058
Crab, lobster,
raw fish.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.393
GROVER:
That's right.

00:49.395 --> 00:52.663
You guys eat anything other
than seafood out here?

00:52.665 --> 00:55.196
Well, we eat a lot of seafood.
For what?

00:55.198 --> 00:56.524
Don't know how
you do it, man.

00:56.526 --> 00:58.333
I could not eat the same
kind of food every day.

00:58.335 --> 00:59.365
Actually...

00:59.367 --> 01:01.101
(grunts)
Stop.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.070
I distinctly remember

01:03.072 --> 01:06.037
you dragging me
to this barbecue pit

01:06.039 --> 01:08.339
in Logan Square
every single day.

01:08.341 --> 01:09.706
RENEE:
That's right.

01:09.708 --> 01:11.409
GROVER:
For three weeks.

01:11.411 --> 01:13.345
Till you finally got
yourself up enough nerve

01:13.347 --> 01:16.777
to ask out a certain,
uh, waitress.

01:16.779 --> 01:18.080
But you got to admit...
GROVER: Hmm?

01:18.082 --> 01:20.016
...it was worth it.
Yeah, he got the girl,

01:20.018 --> 01:21.919
and I gained
an extra five pounds.

01:21.921 --> 01:23.183
And another 20
pounds since.

01:23.185 --> 01:24.255
RENEE:
Uh, excuse me.

01:24.257 --> 01:25.582
You know,
I can lose weight.

01:25.584 --> 01:26.782
There ain't no cure
for ugly.

01:26.784 --> 01:28.157
(laughter)
Okay?

01:28.159 --> 01:29.885
That was dirty.
That was dirty.

01:29.887 --> 01:33.755
So... so how are you guys
celebrating tomorrow?

01:33.757 --> 01:36.089
Well, it's kind of
still up in the air,

01:36.091 --> 01:38.360
but we're gonna start out
with a nice long hike,

01:38.362 --> 01:40.695
and then have a little breakfast picnic.
Aw.

01:40.697 --> 01:41.697
That sounds nice.

01:41.698 --> 01:42.832
What you gonna do
after that?

01:42.834 --> 01:44.266
Oh, cut it
out, please.

01:44.268 --> 01:45.268
(laughter)

01:45.269 --> 01:47.307
No, I got a better idea.
Picture this.

01:47.309 --> 01:49.971
You and me,
we go play nine holes.

01:49.973 --> 01:51.676
The ladies

01:51.678 --> 01:53.444
go and do some shopping
over at Ala Moana Mall.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.916
Shopping?

01:54.918 --> 01:56.013
No sales...
Lou.

01:56.015 --> 01:57.717
What?
They are celebrating,

01:57.719 --> 01:59.581
their 20th wedding
anniversary.

01:59.583 --> 02:00.885
I know. So?

02:00.887 --> 02:03.053
Baby, you don't think they
want to spend it together?

02:03.055 --> 02:05.124
I'm sorry, buddy,
but, uh, she's right.

02:05.126 --> 02:08.354
I mean, you guys are a big part
of the reason we're here.

02:08.356 --> 02:12.162
But tomorrow, we want
a little alone time.

02:12.164 --> 02:13.466
Just the two of us.

02:13.468 --> 02:14.793
(purrs)

02:14.795 --> 02:15.801
Oh, brother.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.497
All right, fine, fair enough.

02:17.499 --> 02:19.432
But this Saturday belongs to us.

02:19.434 --> 02:21.503
You two are spending
the entire day with us,

02:21.505 --> 02:22.671
and it's non-negotiable.

02:22.673 --> 02:23.639
To good friends.

02:23.641 --> 02:24.806
Thank you.

02:24.808 --> 02:26.271
To good friends.
Thank you.

02:26.273 --> 02:28.710
(moans)

02:31.280 --> 02:32.982
(laughs)

02:35.649 --> 02:37.919
How you feeling,
Captain?

02:39.825 --> 02:41.855
(laughing):
Oh...

02:41.857 --> 02:43.222
You...

02:44.055 --> 02:46.325
It's possible

02:46.327 --> 02:49.061
I may have been
over-served

02:49.063 --> 02:51.029
last evening.

02:51.031 --> 02:52.333
(laughs)

02:52.335 --> 02:54.996
Yeah, well, you know,
we tried cutting you off,

02:54.998 --> 02:58.036
but you boys just kept on
pounding those Mai Tais.

02:58.038 --> 02:59.499
(groans)

03:01.309 --> 03:03.442
Please do me a favor and
go get me some aspirin.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.209
I don't want the kids
to see me like this.

03:05.211 --> 03:06.537
Baby.

03:06.539 --> 03:07.841
(groans)

03:07.843 --> 03:10.344
The kids are on school
overnight trips.

03:10.346 --> 03:12.343
They won't be back
till tomorrow.

03:13.848 --> 03:15.445
That's right.

03:15.447 --> 03:16.444
(laughs):
Just stop.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.716
(cell phone ringing)

03:17.718 --> 03:19.083
You better be glad
the phone rang.

03:19.085 --> 03:20.946
So naughty.
And my head hurts.

03:20.948 --> 03:21.946
And I'm old.

03:21.948 --> 03:23.817
You're not that old.

03:23.819 --> 03:24.921
Look who it is.

03:24.923 --> 03:26.448
Oh, here, I'll go
get you an aspirin.

03:26.450 --> 03:27.383
All right.

03:27.385 --> 03:29.150
You as hungover
as me?

03:29.152 --> 03:31.789
CLAY: Lou, Lou, you got
to get out here, man.

03:31.791 --> 03:32.989
(static crackling)
...Lou...

03:32.991 --> 03:34.851
Clay, okay...
Clay, calm down.

03:34.853 --> 03:37.089
Clay, calm down,
I don't under...

03:37.091 --> 03:38.591
Baby, please be okay.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.128
She's hurt,
man, she's...

03:40.130 --> 03:41.296
Clay, I...

03:41.298 --> 03:42.727
Come on, baby, come on.
Clay, where are you?

03:42.729 --> 03:44.527
Kualoa Ridge, we're halfway up,
Wh-What's going on?

03:44.529 --> 03:45.527
and she fell.

03:45.529 --> 03:46.526
I think she's dead.

03:46.528 --> 03:47.526
Clay!

03:47.528 --> 03:48.998
Please wake up.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.397

when we got here.

04:38.289 --> 04:40.055
There's nothing
we could have done.

04:40.057 --> 04:41.191

but Mr. Maxwell won't let

Stay here, I'll
talk to him.

Clay.

They-they want
to take her, man.

They can't.

05:23.363 --> 05:26.400
I can't let them...
put her in one of those bags.

05:26.402 --> 05:27.400
I can't do it.

05:27.402 --> 05:29.903
Buddy.

05:29.905 --> 05:32.903
They have to take her,
and you have to let them.

05:32.905 --> 05:35.575
We'll ride down
there together

05:35.577 --> 05:37.008
with Diane,
you and me.

05:37.010 --> 05:39.774
I promise you,
I know the M.E.,

05:39.776 --> 05:41.908
he will take good
care of her.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.208
We got to go, partner.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.447
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.479
All right.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.855
All right.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.022
Watch your step now.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.654
Be careful.

06:00.656 --> 06:02.789
She's gonna be fine,
she's gonna be fine.

PUA: Vic's name is Glen Hurd,
34 years old.

06:13.137 --> 06:15.303
He's the building's
leasing agent.

06:15.305 --> 06:17.144
Custodian found the body
when he arrived

06:17.146 --> 06:19.009
for work this morning.

06:19.011 --> 06:20.616
Any signs of forced entry?

06:20.618 --> 06:22.681
Negative.
All right.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.353
I'm gonna need a list
of, uh, anybody

06:24.355 --> 06:27.219
who could have gotten in or out
of this place, uh, after hours.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.323
I'll get on it.

06:28.325 --> 06:30.291
Okay, thanks.

06:30.293 --> 06:31.724
Dr. Shaw.

06:31.726 --> 06:33.131
Morning, Detective.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.066
What's going on? There's usually
more of you around here.

06:35.068 --> 06:36.594
Yeah, we're a little
short-staffed this morning.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.727
The rest of the team is out
at Kualoa with, uh, Dr. Bergman.

06:39.729 --> 06:40.895
All right, what
can you tell me?

06:40.897 --> 06:42.936
SHAW: Single GSW to the chest,
no exit wound.

06:42.938 --> 06:45.000
What about
time of death?

06:45.002 --> 06:46.776
Uh, based on rigor
and body temp,

06:46.778 --> 06:49.473
I'd estimate time of death
at around 1:00 a.m.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.178
All right, uh, why
don't we hurry up,

06:51.180 --> 06:52.514
get this guy
to the morgue,

06:52.516 --> 06:54.346
get that bullet out,
see if we have any luck

06:54.348 --> 06:55.348
with ballistics.

06:55.349 --> 06:56.754
There's nobody... You need help?

06:56.756 --> 06:58.754
Oh, yeah, I'll just ask
Officer Kai.

06:58.756 --> 07:00.292
No, he's got
to stick around

07:00.294 --> 07:02.695
and secure the crime scene.
I'll help you out.

07:02.697 --> 07:04.369
Wow, chivalry's not dead.

07:04.371 --> 07:05.834
Nope, just this guy.

07:05.836 --> 07:07.034
(chuckles)

07:07.036 --> 07:08.571
(elevator bell dings)

07:18.855 --> 07:20.789
So, you know,
I really owe you one.

07:20.791 --> 07:22.854
Yeah, just don't ask me
to help with the autopsy.

07:22.856 --> 07:24.496
I wasn't talking about this,

07:24.498 --> 07:26.497
although I do appreciate
the assist.

07:26.499 --> 07:29.802
I, um, I wanted to thank you for
suggesting I take up surfing.

07:29.804 --> 07:31.866
Oh.
I've been catching waves every morning.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.274
Uh, just ankle
snappers.

07:33.276 --> 07:36.010
But, um, it's been...
therapeutic.

07:36.012 --> 07:37.337
Well, good.

07:37.339 --> 07:38.408
I'm glad, you know.

07:38.410 --> 07:40.238
Nobody, uh... nobody
ever takes my advice.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.877
Not even your daughter?
She's 12.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.611
Enough said.

07:43.613 --> 07:46.473
(elevator clatters, stops)

07:46.475 --> 07:48.778
This isn't good.
No, it's fine.

07:52.021 --> 07:54.155
You got to be kidding me.

07:54.157 --> 07:55.452
No signal.

07:55.454 --> 07:56.652
Uh...

07:57.622 --> 07:59.590
Hello! Pua!

07:59.592 --> 08:01.062
Somebody help!

08:01.064 --> 08:02.565
Somebody's gonna hear us, right?

08:02.567 --> 08:04.963
Crime scene's on
the other side of the building.

08:05.795 --> 08:07.295
Oh.

08:07.297 --> 08:08.927
Keep making noise.

08:08.929 --> 08:10.463
Yo!
Hello?!

08:16.138 --> 08:17.567
This was my fault.

08:17.569 --> 08:19.639
Come on, now,
don't say that.

08:19.641 --> 08:22.677
I was walking in front of her.

08:22.679 --> 08:24.309
So I didn't even see it happen.

08:24.311 --> 08:25.580
I just heard her yell,

08:25.582 --> 08:28.146
and then I turned around,
and she...

08:28.148 --> 08:30.314
she was gone.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.585
I should have been
holding her hand.

08:34.587 --> 08:36.384
I should have been
looking out for her.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.152
Hey, hey, hey,
come on, now.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.352
Hey.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.193
Look at me, look at me.

08:45.027 --> 08:46.529
This was not your fault.

08:46.531 --> 08:48.697
This was nobody's fault.

08:49.803 --> 08:52.336
It's just a horrible accident.

08:57.209 --> 08:59.702
How am I supposed to just go on?

08:59.704 --> 09:02.343
She was my life.

09:08.516 --> 09:11.448
I'm so, so sorry.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.184
(sniffles)

09:13.186 --> 09:14.720
I'm sorry.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.728
She loved you so
much, you know.

09:18.730 --> 09:20.727
I mean, the
both of you.

09:22.465 --> 09:25.799
She's... she's with
God now, right?

09:25.801 --> 09:28.567
RENEE: You're gonna
come with me, okay?

09:30.305 --> 09:32.239
You're gonna come
back to our house.

09:32.241 --> 09:33.303
Lou?

09:33.305 --> 09:35.774
I'll be along
as soon as I can, babe.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.078
Okay.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.614
Come on. Come on.

10:01.361 --> 10:03.495
(vehicle approaching)

10:05.330 --> 10:07.504
(car door opens, closes)

10:13.042 --> 10:14.672
How you doing?

10:14.674 --> 10:16.376
Thanks for coming.

10:16.378 --> 10:17.977
Yeah, of course.

10:17.979 --> 10:19.649
I just, I-I...
I kind of figured

10:19.651 --> 10:22.185
you'd want to be
with Clay right now.

10:23.922 --> 10:27.351
I just kind of want to walk the
scene a little bit, you know.

10:29.657 --> 10:30.990
Why?

10:30.992 --> 10:34.829
I mean, HPD's already
been out here.

10:36.663 --> 10:38.494
Lou, what's going on?

10:41.271 --> 10:44.604
Me and Clay, we
come up together.

10:44.606 --> 10:46.667
Went to the
academy together.

10:46.669 --> 10:48.938
Walked the
beat together.

10:50.675 --> 10:52.336
I known the
man 25 years.

10:52.338 --> 10:56.039
In a lot of ways,
we know each other

10:56.041 --> 10:58.405
better than our wives do.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.108
Did.

11:02.704 --> 11:07.046
Over the years, I've talked
to hundreds of victims

11:07.048 --> 11:09.710
who've lost their loved ones.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.014
But Clay--

11:11.016 --> 11:15.287
he's saying all the
things you usually hear.

11:15.289 --> 11:19.159
And I can't explain it...

11:19.161 --> 11:22.094
but there's something
about the way

11:22.096 --> 11:24.389
he's saying it.

11:24.391 --> 11:26.597
It just doesn't seem genuine.

11:26.599 --> 11:28.093
I-I don't understand.

11:28.095 --> 11:30.229
What are you...
what are you saying?

11:30.231 --> 11:34.641
I'm saying I don't think
this thing was an accident.

11:43.134 --> 11:44.468
Okay, wait a minute,
all right?

11:45.217 --> 11:47.248
You're telling me that Clay,
your best friend,

11:47.250 --> 11:50.921
guy you known for 25 years,
pushed his wife off this cliff?

11:50.923 --> 11:51.985
Yeah, that's what
I'm thinking.

11:51.987 --> 11:53.057
Why would he do that?

11:53.059 --> 11:54.226
I don't know.

11:54.228 --> 11:56.226
Maybe they come up here
and they had a fight.

11:56.228 --> 11:57.226
The guy's got a temper.

11:57.228 --> 11:59.467
Heat of the moment?

11:59.469 --> 12:00.763
Maybe it was premeditated.

12:00.765 --> 12:02.269
I don't know
the reason,

12:02.271 --> 12:04.174
but I know him.

12:04.176 --> 12:06.639
And I'm telling you,
there's more to this thing.

12:06.641 --> 12:09.112
Lou...
Just hear me out.

12:09.114 --> 12:10.784
All right, so...

12:10.786 --> 12:11.713
they come up here.

12:11.715 --> 12:13.385
<i>They're walking this way.</i>

12:13.387 --> 12:14.618
(Diane laughs)

12:14.620 --> 12:15.890
<i>According to Clay,</i>

12:15.892 --> 12:17.426
<i>he's walking in front of her,</i>

12:17.428 --> 12:18.922
<i>He didn't even see her drop.</i>

12:18.924 --> 12:21.331
(Diane screams)

12:23.302 --> 12:25.565
<i>But I don't see</i>
<i>how in the world</i>

12:25.567 --> 12:26.836
<i>she could've lost her footing.</i>

12:26.838 --> 12:29.835
Yeah, it's high up here
and the trails get narrow,

12:29.837 --> 12:31.939
but look around
here; it's wide.

12:31.941 --> 12:35.443
All you have to do is
just hug this side,

12:35.445 --> 12:38.411
and there's no way that you're
gonna fall off this thing.

12:38.413 --> 12:40.083
Yeah, if she's
paying attention.

12:40.085 --> 12:42.451
What if she got distracted?

12:42.453 --> 12:45.283
Listen, just hear
me out now, okay?

12:45.285 --> 12:47.386
Look around.

12:47.388 --> 12:50.090
I mean, there's a lot
to take in here, Lou.

12:50.092 --> 12:52.657
She takes her eyes
off the track for a minute,

12:52.659 --> 12:54.727
gets too close
to the edge, it's wet,

12:54.729 --> 12:56.558
slippery...

12:56.560 --> 12:58.262
she goes over.

12:58.264 --> 12:59.230
It happens.

12:59.232 --> 13:00.862
And as far as this thing
being planned...

13:00.864 --> 13:03.102
I mean, I spoke to Duke
on the way out here,

13:03.104 --> 13:05.934
and he told me that Clay
risked serious injury

13:05.936 --> 13:07.870
climbing down this cliff
to get to his wife.

13:07.872 --> 13:09.976
He could've doubled back
down this trail,

13:09.978 --> 13:11.808
but that would've
taken more time.

13:11.810 --> 13:14.976
Clearly, he was... he was
desperate to get to his wife.

13:14.978 --> 13:17.848
Now, if this was deliberate,
that wouldn't be the case.

13:17.850 --> 13:20.081
Yeah, unless he's worried
about how it's gonna look

13:20.083 --> 13:21.817
if he takes the long way around.

13:24.029 --> 13:25.323
Listen to me.

13:25.325 --> 13:29.300
Every day, you and I,
we see people at their worst.

13:29.302 --> 13:32.332
So it's natural for us
to always be suspicious.

13:33.838 --> 13:36.507
But I got to tell you,

13:36.509 --> 13:39.307
there is nothing here
that points to anything

13:39.309 --> 13:42.010
other than an accident,
as far as I can see.

13:43.811 --> 13:47.208
And what about
a cop's intuition, hmm?

13:47.210 --> 13:49.381
What about that?

13:51.246 --> 13:54.412
Well... I absolutely
believe in that.

13:57.487 --> 14:00.557
But I also know that...

14:00.559 --> 14:03.461
really bad things happen
sometimes for no reason at all.

14:03.463 --> 14:06.860
(thunder rumbling)

14:06.862 --> 14:09.300
Yeah.

14:11.102 --> 14:13.132
DANNY: Oh! Hey!
Stuck in here!

14:13.134 --> 14:14.100
Pua!

14:14.102 --> 14:15.899
You gonna help or not?

14:15.901 --> 14:17.571
Honestly, Detective,
I think it's a lost cause.

14:17.573 --> 14:19.538
I think we just need
to accept the fact

14:19.540 --> 14:21.609
that we are stuck in here
until someone finds us.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.474
Oh, yeah?
When's that gonna be?

14:23.476 --> 14:25.042
Hopefully, before this body
starts to get ripe.

14:25.044 --> 14:26.811
Oh, that's funny. Let me
explain something to you.

14:26.813 --> 14:29.084
Doing nothing is not an option.
You think this is funny?

14:29.086 --> 14:30.747
It's not funny. I've heard
of stories of people

14:30.749 --> 14:32.050
getting stuck in elevators
for days-- days.

14:32.052 --> 14:33.922
I really don't think
that's gonna happen.

14:33.924 --> 14:35.259
My cell phone doesn't work,
your cell phone doesn't work,

14:35.261 --> 14:36.323
the alarm doesn't work. Okay?

14:36.325 --> 14:37.626
No one's coming
to look at office space

14:37.628 --> 14:39.458
because this guy, the
office manager, is dead.

14:39.460 --> 14:42.394
We have got to be proactive.
Or we can conserve energy.

14:42.396 --> 14:43.795
We got no food, we got no water.

14:43.797 --> 14:45.467
Oxygen level in here
is getting very low.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.869
There's plenty of oxygen.
Then why can't I breathe?

14:47.871 --> 14:48.973
Detective?

14:48.975 --> 14:50.405
Can't stay in
this place.

14:50.407 --> 14:51.541
Can't stay in this box anymore.

14:51.543 --> 14:53.078
I can't stay in this box.
What is happening?

14:53.080 --> 14:54.981
All right, look,
I am, uh...

14:54.983 --> 14:56.277
I am very
claustrophobic,

14:56.279 --> 14:57.916
like, very, very,
very claustrophobic.

14:57.918 --> 14:59.747
And I've been trying to hold it
together, but if I don't get out

14:59.749 --> 15:01.009
of this box soon,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

15:01.011 --> 15:02.481
And I don't want to
lose my mind, okay?

15:02.483 --> 15:04.482
In fact, I think that
right now it's happening.

15:04.484 --> 15:05.722
Okay, okay, okay.

15:05.724 --> 15:06.889
Listen to me.
(clears throat)

15:06.891 --> 15:08.249
Everything is gonna be okay.

15:08.251 --> 15:09.656
Yeah?
Okay, right now,

15:09.658 --> 15:12.424
neurotransmitters in your brain
have sent the wrong signal...

15:12.426 --> 15:13.527
Uh-huh?

15:13.529 --> 15:15.655
...activating your
sympathetic nervous system.

15:15.657 --> 15:16.992
You just need to ride this out

15:16.994 --> 15:18.663
until your parasympathetic
nervous system

15:18.665 --> 15:20.799
can restore your body
to a normal state.

15:20.801 --> 15:22.935
That's good. Can you do me a
favor and speak English, please?

15:22.937 --> 15:25.070
Okay. Your body is lying to you.

15:25.072 --> 15:27.501
It's telling you you're
in danger, but you're not.

15:27.503 --> 15:28.532
You're not.

15:28.534 --> 15:29.972
So it's like a glitch.
Exactly!

15:29.974 --> 15:31.106
It's a glitch.

15:31.108 --> 15:32.433
Uh-huh.
That's all. Just a glitch.

15:32.435 --> 15:33.769
There's no danger.
No danger.

15:33.771 --> 15:36.041
There's no...
there's no threat, okay?

15:36.043 --> 15:37.840
You're completely safe.
Absolutely.

15:37.842 --> 15:40.038
Now just breathe. Just relax.
(inhales deeply)

15:40.040 --> 15:42.107
Breathe.
(exhales)

15:44.676 --> 15:47.072
There you go. You got it.

15:49.377 --> 15:50.742
Thank you.
You're welcome.

15:50.744 --> 15:53.110
It's not often I get
to use my medical knowledge

15:53.112 --> 15:55.077
to help living people.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.116
CLAY (over recording):
I need your help. My wife.

15:57.118 --> 15:59.050
911 OPERATOR:
Sir, what happened to your wife?

15:59.052 --> 16:00.416
CLAY: She fell!
She fell off the cliff!

16:00.418 --> 16:02.016
911 OPERATOR:
What is your location?

16:02.018 --> 16:03.248
CLAY:
Kualoa Ridge.

16:03.250 --> 16:04.648
Come on, you got to send help!

16:04.650 --> 16:06.120
911 OPERATOR: Yes, sir,
I'm sending paramedics.

16:06.122 --> 16:07.592
What is your wife's condition?

16:07.594 --> 16:08.656
CLAY:
I don't know.

16:08.658 --> 16:10.288
I'm trying to get down to her.

16:10.290 --> 16:13.296
Oh, God, baby, please be okay.

16:15.363 --> 16:17.067
911 OPERATOR:
What is your wife's condition?

16:17.069 --> 16:18.140
CLAY:
I don't know.

16:18.142 --> 16:19.268
I'm trying to get down to her.

16:19.270 --> 16:23.003
Oh, God, baby, please be okay.

16:23.005 --> 16:24.473
Clay's 911 call.

16:24.475 --> 16:25.673
You want to listen?

16:25.675 --> 16:27.273
911 OPERATOR:
What is your wife's condition?

16:27.275 --> 16:28.609
CLAY:
I don't know.

16:28.611 --> 16:30.609
I'm trying to get down to her.

16:30.611 --> 16:33.513
Oh, God, baby, please be okay.

16:34.754 --> 16:37.119
Sounds pretty shaken up, upset.
Mm-hmm.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.750
He sounded just like that
when he called me.

16:39.752 --> 16:41.758
If it's a performance,
it's a good one.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.157
It's convincing.

16:43.159 --> 16:45.355
Yeah.

16:45.357 --> 16:47.092
Except...

16:47.094 --> 16:49.692
where's the sounds of him
“risking serious injury”

16:49.694 --> 16:51.763
working his way
down to his wife?

16:51.765 --> 16:53.994
You'd at least
hear some effort.

16:53.996 --> 16:55.466
Branches snapping.

16:55.468 --> 16:57.098
Rocky terrain breaking loose.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.370
And I got another problem.

16:58.372 --> 17:00.770
I just talked
to a hiker

17:00.772 --> 17:02.371
who made a second 911 call.

17:02.373 --> 17:03.907
It turns out,

17:03.909 --> 17:07.640
she heard Diane scream
when she went over the side.

17:07.642 --> 17:10.342
But after that...

17:10.344 --> 17:11.973
nothing.

17:11.976 --> 17:16.012
She didn't hear Clay
calling out to his wife.

17:16.015 --> 17:18.813
If that had been my wife,

17:18.815 --> 17:21.787
I'd have been going
out of my mind like a maniac,

17:21.789 --> 17:23.050
yelling out her name.

17:23.053 --> 17:25.093
How come Clay
didn't do that?

17:25.095 --> 17:28.156
That don't strike you
the least bit odd?

17:30.125 --> 17:32.130
Oh, it does.

17:43.458 --> 17:46.624
Hey, I'm sorry
to have to do this, buddy.

17:46.626 --> 17:47.991
Ah, it's okay.

17:47.993 --> 17:49.623
You know, I know
the drill, man.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.063
You-you need
a statement.

17:51.065 --> 17:53.862
But I'll try to get you through
this as quickly as possible.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.732
I pretty much have
all the information I need.

17:55.734 --> 17:58.931
Just want to fill in
a couple of blanks.

17:58.933 --> 18:00.803
So let's start with the hike.

18:00.805 --> 18:01.835
Whose idea was that?

18:01.837 --> 18:02.866
Diane's?

18:02.868 --> 18:04.498
What time
did you guys set out?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.506
About 6:00.

18:05.508 --> 18:06.801
Ooh. That's early.

18:06.803 --> 18:08.073
Why so early?

18:08.075 --> 18:10.103
Well, we wanted to get out there
before it got too hot.

18:10.105 --> 18:11.341
All right.

18:11.343 --> 18:13.233
You guys take any pictures?

18:14.802 --> 18:15.838
Yeah.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.405
Yeah, Diane,

18:17.407 --> 18:21.265
uh, shot a selfie of us
at the foot of the trail.

18:21.267 --> 18:25.839
We were gonna shoot
some more pics, uh...

18:25.841 --> 18:28.342
when we got to the top.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.908
After the accident,

18:33.910 --> 18:36.477
about how long do you think
it took before you called 911?

18:36.479 --> 18:37.948
I don't know.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.180
15, 20 seconds.

18:39.182 --> 18:41.318
I was just
scrambling,

18:41.320 --> 18:43.222
trying to get down to her
and I called on the way.

18:43.224 --> 18:45.420
I guess before that,
you were pretty hysterical.

18:45.422 --> 18:48.122
Just... screaming out
her name and...

18:48.124 --> 18:50.458
Yeah.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.826
Yeah, I must've...

18:51.828 --> 18:54.257
I must've yelled her name
at least three, four times.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.162
Three or four times?

18:59.333 --> 19:00.971
I was just, you know...

19:00.973 --> 19:03.170
I was just screaming.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.975
I mean, why? Is that important?

19:06.977 --> 19:09.068
Well, not to me.

19:09.070 --> 19:12.708
But, um, the state demands
a thorough inquiry.

19:12.710 --> 19:15.141
You have an accident
in one of their parks,

19:15.143 --> 19:17.443
they want to know
as much detail as possible.

19:17.445 --> 19:19.209
I'm almost done.

19:19.211 --> 19:21.376
♪ ♪

19:49.833 --> 19:52.100
♪ ♪

19:56.745 --> 19:59.576
Well, the hotel was a bust.

19:59.578 --> 20:01.946
Please tell me
you guys had better luck.

20:01.948 --> 20:03.682
We dug through the Maxwells'
personal and financial lives.

20:03.684 --> 20:06.956
Didn't come across
any red flags.

20:06.958 --> 20:09.524
Nothing unusual
in their bank statements.

20:09.526 --> 20:12.026
No beefed-up
insurance policy on Diane.

20:12.028 --> 20:13.362
STEVE:
Uh, the truth is, Lou,

20:13.364 --> 20:14.658
we're short on motive

20:14.660 --> 20:16.097
and we're short on evidence.

20:16.099 --> 20:18.497
KONO: I just got off the phone
with the crime lab.

20:18.499 --> 20:20.768
They found traces of
vegetation and minerals

20:20.770 --> 20:22.464
on Clay and Diane's clothing

20:22.466 --> 20:23.832
consistent with those
found at Kualoa.

20:23.834 --> 20:26.568
Diane's blood was on both
her own and on Clay's,

20:26.570 --> 20:29.577
but that was likely transferred
when he was giving her CPR.

20:29.579 --> 20:31.210
Well, were there
any unusual rips

20:31.212 --> 20:32.714
or-or tears in the clothing?

20:32.716 --> 20:34.250
Nothing that speaks
to a struggle.

20:34.252 --> 20:35.746
Well, she wouldn't
know it was coming.

20:35.748 --> 20:38.083
She wouldn't have even known
to protect herself.

20:38.085 --> 20:39.925
She trusted him.

20:39.927 --> 20:41.493
He was her husband.

20:41.495 --> 20:42.726
CHIN:
You know, Lou,

20:42.728 --> 20:45.329
a lot of guys
in my old squad

20:45.331 --> 20:48.665
believed I.A. when they said
I was a dirty cop.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.169
When I asked them why,
they said

20:50.171 --> 20:51.809
it was just something
they could feel.

20:51.811 --> 20:54.441
They went with
their instinct,

20:54.443 --> 20:56.239
and they turned
their back on me.

20:56.241 --> 20:57.439
But they were wrong.

20:57.441 --> 20:58.742
I'm not wrong.

20:58.744 --> 21:00.278
How can you
be so sure?

21:04.979 --> 21:07.909
You know, one night
when we were at the academy,

21:07.911 --> 21:10.979
one of our training officers
busted me and Clay

21:10.981 --> 21:13.945
trying to sneak back on campus
after lights out.

21:13.947 --> 21:17.815
Now, as violations go,
it was pretty serious.

21:17.817 --> 21:19.813
Absolute grounds
for expulsion.

21:19.815 --> 21:22.577
So the T.O.--
he sits us down.

21:22.579 --> 21:23.544
Now, this guy

21:23.546 --> 21:24.847
was a human lie detector.

21:24.849 --> 21:26.510
Never met a suspect
he couldn't break.

21:26.512 --> 21:28.916
So he says to us,

21:28.918 --> 21:31.451
“You two birds better have

21:31.453 --> 21:33.480
“a damn good reason
for breaking curfew.

21:33.482 --> 21:34.614
“Otherwise,

21:34.616 --> 21:36.911
“I'm shipping your sorry asses

21:36.913 --> 21:38.805
out on the next bus.”

21:38.807 --> 21:43.277
Now the truth is:
we were at a ball game.

21:43.279 --> 21:44.613
Went to a White Sox game.

21:44.615 --> 21:46.549
The thing goes extra innings,
and now we're late.

21:46.551 --> 21:48.988
But Clay looked that T.O.
right in the eye

21:48.990 --> 21:51.651
and without missing a beat,
he says,

21:51.653 --> 21:54.353
“I'm sorry, sir.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.624
“But my cousin...

21:56.626 --> 21:58.287
“he's shipping off
in the morning

21:58.289 --> 21:59.823
“to the Gulf for Desert Shield,

21:59.825 --> 22:01.727
“and the kid's nervous.

22:01.729 --> 22:03.359
“He's scared.

22:03.361 --> 22:05.664
“So Lou and I just figured
we'd just take the kid out,

22:05.666 --> 22:07.898
“show him a good time, you know,
get his mind off things.

22:07.900 --> 22:12.308
And that way, at least he gets
a proper send-off, you know?”

22:12.310 --> 22:17.845
The T.O. looks into Clay's eyes,
and after a couple of seconds,

22:17.847 --> 22:21.149
he says... “Okay.

22:22.791 --> 22:25.451
Don't let it
happen again.”

22:25.453 --> 22:27.723
And that was that.

22:27.725 --> 22:30.291
I never seen anybody lie

22:30.293 --> 22:32.626
with such confidence,

22:32.628 --> 22:33.657
such conviction.

22:33.659 --> 22:34.896
If you would've hooked Clay up

22:34.898 --> 22:36.464
to a polygraph
right then and there,

22:36.466 --> 22:38.030
I'm telling you,
he would've passed it.

22:38.032 --> 22:40.732
But it ain't even so much
the lying.

22:40.734 --> 22:46.404
Clay knew how to play
on this man's emotions.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.003
This morning,

22:48.005 --> 22:50.538
I'm sitting on the bench
outside the M.E.'s office,

22:50.540 --> 22:53.273
and I'm listening to him
tell me how this went down.

22:53.275 --> 22:54.809
And he's talking to me,

22:54.811 --> 22:56.975
and he's looking at me, and he's
looking me right in the eye,

22:56.977 --> 22:59.646
and I'm going for it,
until my wife shows up.

22:59.648 --> 23:04.110
And I get up and step back, and
I watched him handle my wife.

23:04.112 --> 23:07.582
And that little voice
popped into my head saying,

23:07.584 --> 23:11.189
“This guy is playing you.”

23:13.022 --> 23:15.787
He did this.

23:15.789 --> 23:19.457
Now, I can't prove it,
but I know.

23:19.459 --> 23:22.162
And I'm telling you,
I know like I know

23:22.164 --> 23:25.390
whose name is
on my driver's license!

23:27.896 --> 23:30.302
He did this.

23:30.304 --> 23:33.039
I know it.

23:38.749 --> 23:40.884
MINDY:
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

23:40.886 --> 23:42.315
It's got to be in here.

23:42.317 --> 23:44.252
I always carry an energy bar
for an emergency.

23:44.254 --> 23:46.557
And being trapped
in this metal box

23:46.559 --> 23:48.189
without any food
and any water

23:48.191 --> 23:49.829
is definitely
an emergency, so...

23:49.831 --> 23:51.229
So was last Tuesday.

23:51.231 --> 23:52.963
What does that mean?
I skipped breakfast,

23:52.965 --> 23:55.025
had the energy bar
around 11:00 a.m.,

23:55.027 --> 23:56.527
and I forgot to replace it.

23:56.529 --> 23:57.726
That's great.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.961
Now the only question is:
do we starve to death

23:59.963 --> 24:01.088
or die of dehydration first?

24:01.090 --> 24:02.192
Oh, we'll die
of dehydration

24:02.194 --> 24:04.727
way before we get the chance
to starve.

24:06.033 --> 24:09.897
You know what, we have been
in here for a few hours.

24:09.899 --> 24:14.441
And with time, evidence can
degrade, even disappear.

24:14.443 --> 24:16.641
So I am gonna
get started on

24:16.643 --> 24:19.345
the external examination
of our victim.

24:19.347 --> 24:21.144
In here?
You're gonna do that in here?

24:21.146 --> 24:22.944
Yeah. I'm sure we'll
be rescued soon,

24:22.946 --> 24:25.982
and when we are, you'll want
to hit the ground running.

24:25.984 --> 24:28.846
Also, nothing takes your mind
off your stomach

24:28.848 --> 24:30.116
quite like an autopsy.

24:30.118 --> 24:31.516
Okay.

24:31.518 --> 24:32.515
(camera clicking)

24:32.517 --> 24:34.882
Record my report,
would you please?

24:36.019 --> 24:37.351
(phone beeps)

24:37.353 --> 24:39.718
Autopsy was begun
at approximately

24:39.720 --> 24:43.587
11:45 on
April 3, 2015.

24:43.589 --> 24:47.426
The victim is wearing
a blue sport coat.

24:47.428 --> 24:50.024
Underneath,
he is wearing

24:50.026 --> 24:52.559
a blue and white striped shirt

24:52.561 --> 24:55.696
that's been unbuttoned
all the way down to his navel.

24:55.698 --> 24:57.528
That's very strange.

25:01.736 --> 25:04.670
The wound is not
fully consistent with a GSW.

25:04.672 --> 25:07.270
There are cuts around the edges

25:07.272 --> 25:09.510
approximately an eighth
of an inch in length

25:09.512 --> 25:11.248
that were made
postmortem.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.113
So maybe the killer
tried to take the slug out.

25:13.115 --> 25:14.712
I'm not finding anything.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.017
(sighs)

25:16.019 --> 25:17.521
So, killer shoots Hurd,

25:17.523 --> 25:19.785
unbuttons his shirt,
tries to take the bullet out

25:19.787 --> 25:21.961
because he has a gun
that is registered to him,

25:21.963 --> 25:23.161
and he's worried
about ballistics.

25:23.163 --> 25:24.657
Do you have
a magnifying glass?

25:24.659 --> 25:26.896
Yeah.

25:26.898 --> 25:29.360
Thank you.

25:31.202 --> 25:32.504
All right, good.

25:32.506 --> 25:34.904
Got a partial print
on that button.

25:34.906 --> 25:37.408
It's getting
pretty humid in here.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.703
You got anything we can
preserve this evidence with?

25:39.705 --> 25:41.406
Uh, not in there,

25:41.408 --> 25:44.340
but will you grab the
compact out of my purse.

25:46.214 --> 25:48.845
Compact.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.486
Those things can be
pretty airtight.

25:50.488 --> 25:52.351
Oh, look at you.

25:52.353 --> 25:53.887
Like a regular Girl Scout.

25:53.889 --> 25:57.790
Girl Scout would've replaced
the energy bar, but thanks.

25:57.792 --> 25:58.989
Okay.

26:00.831 --> 26:02.925
I mean, it's just...

26:02.927 --> 26:05.027
it's just so hard,
you know, having to...

26:05.029 --> 26:07.729
having to say it
over and over.

26:07.731 --> 26:10.091
RENEE: Okay, you know, I think
you've done enough for today.

26:10.728 --> 26:12.430
Hey.
Oh, good, baby.

26:12.432 --> 26:13.430
You're home.

26:13.432 --> 26:14.671
Would you please talk to him?

26:14.673 --> 26:16.069
No, I'm-I'm good, man.

26:16.071 --> 26:17.668
I'm-I'm fine. I'm... I...

26:17.670 --> 26:19.467
I just been calling
our family and friends,

26:19.469 --> 26:22.706
and giving them the news,
and I-I'm just overwhelmed.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.074
He hasn't eaten
anything all day.

26:25.076 --> 26:27.811
I don't have much
of an appetite right now.

26:27.813 --> 26:29.316
You know, I was gonna say
maybe you should

26:29.318 --> 26:30.517
lie down for a little while.

26:30.519 --> 26:32.455
GROVER:
You know, Clay,

26:32.457 --> 26:34.288
I think that might be
a good idea.

26:36.163 --> 26:37.929
(sighs)

26:37.931 --> 26:40.194
I don't know what I'd do
without you guys.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.299
Hey, thanks, man.

26:44.301 --> 26:45.836
Aw, man.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.405
You get some rest, brother.

26:59.223 --> 27:00.685
What's going on?

27:00.687 --> 27:02.724
Where have you been? I...
Shh-shh.

27:07.231 --> 27:09.492
Look, honey, I've been
working on a case.

27:09.494 --> 27:10.861
They can't cover for you?

27:10.863 --> 27:12.229
Your oldest friend
loses his wife,

27:12.231 --> 27:13.870
and they can't
cover for you? This...

27:13.872 --> 27:15.566
Diane is the case.

27:15.568 --> 27:17.575
I don't understand.

27:17.577 --> 27:19.239
I think he's lying.

27:19.241 --> 27:21.478
I think he may have
done something to her.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.446
What?

27:22.448 --> 27:25.112
Lou, that's not possible.

27:25.114 --> 27:26.951
Honey, can you remember any time

27:26.953 --> 27:29.318
you heard Diane
complain about Clay,

27:29.320 --> 27:31.718
or complain about
their marriage?

27:31.720 --> 27:33.283
Anything like that?

27:33.285 --> 27:35.920
Um... no.

27:35.922 --> 27:38.319
No, she said
that everything was great.

27:38.321 --> 27:40.087
They were looking forward
to the trip.

27:40.089 --> 27:41.358
They were making plans.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.622
All right...
(phone chimes)

27:42.624 --> 27:44.220
Hang on.

27:44.222 --> 27:46.387
Well, that's the M.E.

27:46.389 --> 27:48.155
Diane's autopsy is finished.

27:48.157 --> 27:49.427
Autopsy? My God.

27:49.429 --> 27:51.092
Sweetheart, listen
to me, listen to me.

27:51.094 --> 27:53.299
I need you to do
something for me.

27:53.301 --> 27:55.931
All right?

27:55.933 --> 27:59.403
Now, when you're
sure he's asleep,

27:59.405 --> 28:01.938
I need you to grab his phone
and bring it down to me.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.537
I need to see who
he's been calling,

28:03.539 --> 28:04.736
I need to check
his e-mails.

28:04.738 --> 28:06.574
Baby, this is crazy. I'm not...
Renee.

28:06.576 --> 28:09.572
If he murdered Diane,
he's gonna pay for it.

28:09.574 --> 28:11.371
And what if he didn't?

28:11.373 --> 28:12.778
What if you're wrong

28:12.780 --> 28:14.242
and Clay finds out
that you suspected him?

28:14.244 --> 28:16.146
I'll deal with that when
it's time to deal with that.

28:16.148 --> 28:18.514
I can't think about
that right now.

28:18.516 --> 28:20.882
All I know is
everything I've learned

28:20.884 --> 28:25.187
in 20-plus years as a cop
is telling me he did this.

28:25.189 --> 28:27.892
(phone chimes)

28:27.894 --> 28:29.492
Look, that's the M.E. again,
baby.

28:29.494 --> 28:32.061
Please, please,
just do this for me.

28:32.063 --> 28:34.227
Do this for me.

28:47.456 --> 28:49.527
Hey. It's been quiet.

28:49.529 --> 28:51.095
Everyone cleared out at 0800.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.127
Got it.
Have a good day.

28:53.129 --> 28:54.503
Shoots.

29:43.245 --> 29:44.347
It's just me.

29:44.349 --> 29:46.379
(sighs)

29:46.381 --> 29:49.084
(groans)

29:49.086 --> 29:50.715
Sorry.

29:50.717 --> 29:52.953
(sighs)

29:52.955 --> 29:54.184
You okay?

29:54.186 --> 29:55.287
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:55.289 --> 29:56.948
I was just bringing
you a glass of water.

29:56.950 --> 29:58.116
I didn't mean
to wake you.

29:58.118 --> 30:00.491
(sighs)

30:00.493 --> 30:02.723
Cop reflexes--
I can't help them.

30:02.725 --> 30:06.489
Yeah, I toss and turn
all night, too.

30:06.491 --> 30:09.392
I would wake Diane up
all the time.

30:09.394 --> 30:11.327
Every night.

30:11.329 --> 30:13.694
I'd tell her, I'll go sleep
in the guest room,

30:13.696 --> 30:15.062
but she wouldn't let me.

30:15.064 --> 30:17.701
She'd say she'd...

30:17.703 --> 30:22.334
rather lie awake
together than...

30:22.336 --> 30:26.605
than to sleep without me there,
you know.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.138
(sighs)

30:28.140 --> 30:29.209
I'm-I'm sorry

30:29.211 --> 30:30.176
about your wrist.

30:30.178 --> 30:32.439
No, it's all right.

30:32.441 --> 30:34.238
Why don't you go
back to sleep.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.574
(grunts softly)

30:43.486 --> 30:46.451
(sighs)

31:05.170 --> 31:07.503
Captain Grover,
thank you for coming.

31:07.505 --> 31:10.535
All right, Max, what do you got?

31:10.537 --> 31:12.006
Well, as I suspected,

31:12.008 --> 31:14.605
the C.O.D. was blunt force
trauma to the head and torso

31:14.607 --> 31:15.805
caused by the fall.

31:18.478 --> 31:21.410
But I didn't find evidence
of foul play.

31:21.412 --> 31:24.777
Well, yeah,
but you didn't find anything

31:24.779 --> 31:27.215
that proves that
she <i> wasn't</i> pushed, right?

31:27.217 --> 31:29.182
No, I didn't.

31:29.184 --> 31:32.687
However, without conclusive
evidence to the contrary,

31:32.689 --> 31:34.520
I have no choice but to rule

31:34.522 --> 31:36.625
Mrs. Maxwell's death
as accidental.

31:38.499 --> 31:40.664
I'm sorry.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.543
DANNY:
Please don't fall, okay?

31:58.545 --> 32:00.183
Only thing that'd make
this situation worse:

32:00.185 --> 32:02.079
if I was stuck in here
with two dead bodies.

32:02.081 --> 32:03.214
Oh, I am not gonna fall.

32:03.216 --> 32:04.550
Back home in Carbondale,

32:04.552 --> 32:06.548
my brothers used to put me
up on their shoulders,

32:06.550 --> 32:08.753
and I'd climb over the fence
at the local Y,

32:08.755 --> 32:11.782
unlock the gate so we could
use the pool after hours.

32:11.784 --> 32:13.620
This thing is sealed
from the other side.

32:13.622 --> 32:14.819
I'm never gonna get it open.

32:14.821 --> 32:16.386
That's 'cause
this place is a tomb.

32:16.388 --> 32:17.554
PUA (in distance):
Hello?!

32:17.556 --> 32:18.920
Is anyone there?!
Oh, my God.

32:18.922 --> 32:21.056
Pua,

32:21.058 --> 32:22.656
we're stuck in here!
Get us out of here!

32:22.658 --> 32:23.823
DANNY: Pua!
Hang tight!

32:23.825 --> 32:25.855
I'm calling HFD to get you out!

32:25.857 --> 32:28.223
(laughs)

32:28.225 --> 32:29.929
Yes.
Yes.

32:29.931 --> 32:31.298
(sighs)

32:53.223 --> 32:54.525
(door opens)

32:54.527 --> 32:55.895
RENEE:
Lou.

32:56.729 --> 32:59.168
Hey, um...

32:59.170 --> 33:03.735
I was just about to finish
up here and, uh, head home.

33:05.873 --> 33:07.438
(clears throat)

33:07.440 --> 33:10.374
Renee, I can't prove this thing.

33:10.376 --> 33:13.278
I can't prove it and...

33:15.480 --> 33:17.382
Look, I'm not going to that P.A.

33:17.384 --> 33:18.782
with nothing but
my instincts.

33:18.784 --> 33:20.620
You need to finish
what you started.

33:20.622 --> 33:22.388
Follow every lead.

33:24.790 --> 33:26.292
20-plus years being a cop,

33:26.294 --> 33:28.758
and your instincts have
never steered you wrong.

33:28.760 --> 33:32.864
I know they've gotten you out
of some pretty tough situations.

33:32.866 --> 33:35.968
And I know they've
also brought you home to me.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.744
You trust them.

33:38.746 --> 33:41.175
And I trust you.

33:48.616 --> 33:51.414
Babe...

33:51.416 --> 33:53.054
thank you.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.999
(elevator bell dings)

34:05.033 --> 34:06.871
Buddy, thank
you so much.

34:06.873 --> 34:08.472
Mahalo.
No problem.

34:08.474 --> 34:09.808
You guys okay?
Yeah, we're good.

34:09.810 --> 34:11.871
Uh, listen, I got
a print on a button in here.

34:11.873 --> 34:14.176
Can you get it to the crime lab
and have them run it right away?

34:14.178 --> 34:15.377
On it.
Thank you.

34:15.379 --> 34:17.050
Thanks, guys.

34:19.051 --> 34:21.050
Hey.

34:21.052 --> 34:23.418
Hey.

34:25.494 --> 34:27.493
So how long was I out?

34:27.495 --> 34:29.094
Couple hours.

34:29.096 --> 34:30.797
Can I get you anything?

34:30.800 --> 34:32.429
No, no. Thanks.

34:32.431 --> 34:35.272
All right, well, if you're
not gonna eat anything,

34:35.274 --> 34:37.145
I want you to at least
drink something.

34:37.147 --> 34:38.713
Let me see what we have.

34:43.148 --> 34:45.112
You know, I was
looking for my phone.

34:45.114 --> 34:48.289
Uh, thought I left it
by the bed, but it's not there.

34:48.291 --> 34:49.721
Have you seen it?

34:49.723 --> 34:51.690
No. I haven't.

34:51.692 --> 34:53.322
Have you checked
the living room?

34:53.324 --> 34:55.161
Yeah. Yeah, I-I checked, yeah.

34:55.164 --> 34:57.427
I looked, but it-it's
not there, either.

35:00.501 --> 35:01.499
(sighs)

35:01.501 --> 35:03.068
Well, is Lou home?

35:03.070 --> 35:06.739
No. Uh, you know,
he had to go back to work.

35:08.245 --> 35:11.313
So, what, is he, uh...
is he on a case?

35:11.315 --> 35:13.777
Uh, I don't know.

35:16.387 --> 35:17.985
Renee,

35:17.987 --> 35:20.322
where's my phone?

35:20.324 --> 35:22.290
Clay?

35:22.292 --> 35:23.657
Hey, man, where you been?

35:23.659 --> 35:24.753
I've been at the crime lab.

35:24.755 --> 35:28.191
So, what, are
you on a case?

35:28.193 --> 35:29.927
You're coming with me.

35:29.929 --> 35:32.631
Coming with
you for what?

35:32.633 --> 35:36.333
You're under arrest
for murdering your wife.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.647
That's nice.
Richard Yeager?

35:49.649 --> 35:52.783
What can I do for you guys?

35:52.785 --> 35:54.952
You can drop that club and
put your hands behind your back,

35:54.954 --> 35:56.626
'cause you're under arrest.
For what?

35:56.628 --> 35:58.595
For the murdering your
business partner Glenn Hurd.

35:58.597 --> 36:01.300
That was good that you took
the slug out of his chest,

36:01.302 --> 36:03.429
but we found your .22 at home--
it's been fired recently.

36:03.431 --> 36:05.006
And you left a fingerprint
on the victim's clothing.

36:05.008 --> 36:06.502
I want my lawyer.

36:06.504 --> 36:08.839
Okay. Are you gonna lie to him
or are you gonna tell him that

36:08.841 --> 36:10.607
you killed your business partner
because he found out you were

36:10.609 --> 36:12.008
embezzling money
from the company?

36:12.977 --> 36:14.943
All right, Pua.

36:14.945 --> 36:17.848
Go ahead, book him.

36:17.850 --> 36:20.016
I always wanted to know
what this part was like.

36:20.018 --> 36:22.223
Yeah, well you had a
nice front row seat.

36:25.129 --> 36:27.895
Thank you, uh,
for helping me out

36:27.897 --> 36:30.359
with that, uh, embarrassing
episode earlier today.

36:30.361 --> 36:31.894
Oh, yeah.

36:31.896 --> 36:33.596
Hey, you know, if I ever get
stuck in an elevator

36:33.598 --> 36:35.265
with somebody ever again,
I hope it's with you.

36:35.267 --> 36:36.529
(chuckles)
Ditto, Detective.

36:36.531 --> 36:37.864
All right, good.

36:37.866 --> 36:39.831
All right, let's go find
an elevator, come on.

36:39.833 --> 36:41.263
(laughs):
No!

36:41.265 --> 36:42.999
Come on, it'll be
fun this time.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.903
(door buzzes)

36:46.641 --> 36:49.440
You really
believe this, Lou?

36:49.442 --> 36:53.008
You really think
I could hurt Diane?

36:53.010 --> 36:55.986
If you'd asked me yesterday,
I'd have said no.

36:55.988 --> 36:58.650
No way.

36:58.652 --> 37:01.922
'Cause I loved you
like a brother.

37:01.924 --> 37:04.193
Of course, you were
counting on that.

37:05.731 --> 37:08.266
25 years of friendship
clouding my judgment.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.297
Making me ignore the signs.

37:10.299 --> 37:12.230
You wanted your wife dead,

37:12.232 --> 37:15.899
but you damn sure
didn't want to get caught.

37:15.901 --> 37:19.265
That's why you did it here.

37:19.267 --> 37:22.167
That's why you brought her here.

37:23.970 --> 37:26.039
You needed to shut down
any possibility

37:26.041 --> 37:28.935
of any kind of investigation.

37:28.937 --> 37:31.711
Stop anybody from asking
any hard questions, see?

37:31.713 --> 37:34.310
You thought
I'd do that for you.

37:34.312 --> 37:37.978
Your old partner--
figured I'd have your back.

37:37.980 --> 37:41.084
You used me.

37:41.086 --> 37:43.916
But, see, you forget
one thing, brother.

37:43.918 --> 37:47.049
I know you.

37:47.051 --> 37:50.424
And I saw right through you.

37:50.426 --> 37:53.286
Think about
what you're saying, Lou.

37:53.288 --> 37:54.989
I loved my wife.

37:54.991 --> 37:56.589
I loved Diane.

37:56.591 --> 37:58.556
You saw us at dinner.
We were happy.

37:58.558 --> 38:00.658
Man, please!
That was all an act.

38:00.660 --> 38:03.623
All that phony attention.

38:03.625 --> 38:06.493
Gold earrings and the love note.
You didn't mean any of that.

38:06.495 --> 38:08.763
You already knew
what you were gonna do.

38:08.765 --> 38:10.794
You kept that phony act up

38:10.796 --> 38:13.499
all the way down
to the last second.

38:15.302 --> 38:17.333
How'd you get her to the edge?

38:17.335 --> 38:20.279
What'd you do, tell her
you wanted to take her picture?

38:20.281 --> 38:22.311
With the mountains
in the background?

38:22.313 --> 38:24.183
You smile at her?

38:24.185 --> 38:26.647
Tell her you love her?

38:26.649 --> 38:30.350
She say she loved you, too?

38:30.352 --> 38:32.821
“I love you, baby!
I love you, baby!

38:32.823 --> 38:35.019
Now, move back; I just want
to get these mountains in here”"

38:35.021 --> 38:37.891
And then you start
moving closer.

38:37.893 --> 38:41.395
She probably thought you were
moving in for another kiss.

38:41.397 --> 38:44.661
Not this time though.

38:44.663 --> 38:47.900
This time you moved in,

38:47.902 --> 38:50.003
and you pushed her
over that edge.

38:50.005 --> 38:53.106
And you watched her fall.

38:53.108 --> 38:55.241
And you watched her
hit her head

38:55.243 --> 38:57.375
and crack it open
on those rocks!

38:57.377 --> 38:59.438
That's a lie.

38:59.440 --> 39:02.038
Why would I do that to my wife?

39:02.040 --> 39:03.974
Why?

39:05.681 --> 39:08.385
Oldest reason
in the world, brother.

39:08.387 --> 39:11.151
Oldest motive.

39:11.153 --> 39:13.351
Love.

39:16.225 --> 39:18.391
LeAnn Stockwell.

39:19.896 --> 39:21.829
One of your trainers at the gym.

39:21.831 --> 39:23.164
One you've been having

39:23.166 --> 39:25.660
an affair with
for over a year.

39:25.662 --> 39:27.132
Aw, those photos?

39:27.134 --> 39:28.332
Yeah, these photos.

39:28.334 --> 39:31.739
The photos you took
on your phone and deleted them.

39:31.741 --> 39:33.466
I got teenagers, man.

39:33.468 --> 39:36.568
And you know what my teenagers
taught me about technology?

39:36.570 --> 39:38.271
Nothing gets deleted.

39:38.273 --> 39:40.711
Nothing ever goes away.

39:40.713 --> 39:44.080
I talked to LeAnn, Clay.

39:44.082 --> 39:47.016
She told me you wanted
to leave your wife

39:47.018 --> 39:48.815
and be with her.

39:48.817 --> 39:50.888
So, what, what?
I'm-I'm a killer

39:50.890 --> 39:53.520
because I lied to some piece
I had on the side?

39:53.522 --> 39:54.751
Is that's what you think?

39:54.753 --> 39:57.527
I think you wanted
to start all over with some

39:57.529 --> 40:01.264
fine young thing
that just adored Clay.

40:03.604 --> 40:05.867
Then you did the math.

40:05.869 --> 40:08.843
And you sure as hell didn't want
to live your retirement out

40:08.845 --> 40:11.579
on half your pension
in a small rented apartment

40:11.581 --> 40:13.875
on the South Side
of Chicago.

40:13.877 --> 40:16.713
You know, I really don't
even think it was the money.

40:16.715 --> 40:21.120
I know how much you love people
thinking you're such a good guy.

40:21.122 --> 40:23.920
“Aw, that Clay--
he's a great guy!

40:23.922 --> 40:25.551
Stand-up guy!”

40:25.553 --> 40:27.255
You just didn't want
anybody to know

40:27.257 --> 40:28.623
that you're the kind of guy

40:28.625 --> 40:32.958
who'd step out on his wife
after 20 good years.

40:38.334 --> 40:41.131
I'm done with you.

40:41.133 --> 40:44.235
You know,
that's a great story, Lou.

40:44.237 --> 40:45.772
The thing is...

40:45.774 --> 40:49.309
you can't prove it.

40:50.174 --> 40:52.613
Not yet.

40:54.350 --> 40:56.916
But you're gonna spend
the night in a cell.

40:56.918 --> 40:59.549
And I'm gonna spend the night
on a plane back to Chicago,

40:59.551 --> 41:01.157
and I'm gonna talk
to LeAnn in person.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.084
And then I'm gonna
search your house.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.556
And I'm gonna search your car.

41:04.558 --> 41:06.260
And I'm gonna search
your locker.

41:06.262 --> 41:08.397
And I'm gonna talk
to your friends.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.093
I'm gonna talk
to your neighbors.

41:10.095 --> 41:11.261
I'm gonna talk to your pastor.

41:11.263 --> 41:12.534
I'm gonna talk
to everybody you know

41:12.536 --> 41:14.598
down to the guy
who shines your shoes!

41:14.600 --> 41:17.270
And anything you think
I can do to help you, Clay--

41:17.272 --> 41:20.439
any favor I could call in,
any length that I could go to,

41:20.441 --> 41:22.478
any power or influence
I might have--

41:22.480 --> 41:26.246
I'm gonna use all of that
to lock your ass up!

41:29.118 --> 41:30.917
Smoke on that.

41:33.591 --> 41:35.621
(door buzzes)

41:42.997 --> 41:45.227
STEVE:
Hey.

41:52.941 --> 41:55.939
You could've turned away.

41:55.941 --> 41:58.947
You could've squashed that
little voice in your head.

41:58.949 --> 42:02.212
Let your friend walk.

42:02.214 --> 42:04.852
But you didn't.

42:09.388 --> 42:11.889
Diane was my friend, too.

42:26.765 --> 42:28.932

42:54.833 --> 42:57.096

43:20.987 --> 43:22.890

It's okay, baby.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.787

43:27.627 --> 43:29.825
