>> John: HELLO, THERE!

00:21.889 --> 00:22.527
WELL, WELL, WELL.

00:22.527 --> 00:24.805
UM, THIS IS WEIRD, ISN'T IT?

00:24.805 --> 00:26.917
THIS IS DEFINITELY WEIRD.

00:26.917 --> 00:36.908
LOOK, AS YOU CAN CLEARLY TELL,

00:36.975 --> 00:37.943
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE OUR

00:38.010 --> 00:38.710
USUAL SHOW THIS WEEK.

00:38.777 --> 00:39.544
FOR A START, THERE'S NO

00:39.611 --> 00:40.545
AUDIENCE, AND ALSO, WE'RE NOT

00:40.612 --> 00:41.413
EVEN IN OUR USUAL STUDIO ‐‐

00:41.480 --> 00:42.447
PARTLY BECAUSE WE DO LIKE TO

00:42.514 --> 00:43.482
SHAKE THINGS UP A BIT NOW AND

00:43.548 --> 00:44.549
THEN WHEN WE CAN, AND ALSO

00:44.616 --> 00:45.350
PARTLY BECAUSE OUR ACTUAL STUDIO

00:45.417 --> 00:46.385
MIGHT BE FULL OF CORONAVIRUS.

00:46.451 --> 00:47.252
I'M ACTUALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THAT.

00:47.319 --> 00:48.487
BOTH THE PLACE WHERE WE NORMALLY

00:48.553 --> 00:49.921
TAPE ON SUNDAY AND OUR OFFICE

00:49.988 --> 00:50.989
BUILDING HAD CONFIRMED CASES OF

00:51.056 --> 00:53.525
CORONAVIRUS THIS WEEK.

00:53.592 --> 00:55.961
SO OUR STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING

00:56.028 --> 00:57.996
FROM HOME, AND WE'RE CURRENTLY

00:58.063 --> 00:59.231
TAPING THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH

00:59.297 --> 01:01.299
A VERY LIMITED CREW ON THIS

01:01.366 --> 01:05.003
WHITE VOID SET THAT LOOKS LIKE

01:05.070 --> 01:07.372
THE PLACE MOVIE CHARACTERS GO

01:07.439 --> 01:08.840
WHEN THEY'VE JUST DIED, OR WHERE

01:08.907 --> 01:10.342
THEY SHOT THE KARS4KIDS

COMMERCIAL ‐‐ VERY MUCH, BY THE

01:11.977 --> 01:16.615
WAY, THE CORONAVIRUS OF

01:16.682 --> 01:17.716
COMMERCIALS, IN THAT IT IS

01:17.783 --> 01:18.550
HORRIFICALLY INFECTIOUS AND

01:18.617 --> 01:20.419
RUINS PEOPLE'S LIVES.

01:20.485 --> 01:22.254
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE NOT THE

01:22.320 --> 01:23.155
ONLY ONES WHO'VE HAD TO MAKE BIG

01:23.221 --> 01:27.492
ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR LIVES,

01:27.559 --> 01:29.294
BECAUSE THIS WAS THE WEEK THAT

01:29.361 --> 01:30.729
THE CORONAVIRUS, FOR MANY PEOPLE

01:30.796 --> 01:31.697
HERE IN THE U. S., SEEMED TO GO

01:31.763 --> 01:32.764
FROM AN ABSTRACTION TO A VERY

01:32.831 --> 01:34.166
REAL THREAT ‐‐ AND MAYBE THE

01:34.232 --> 01:36.168
BEST SIGN OF JUST HOW FAST IT

01:36.234 --> 01:41.573
ALL HAPPENED CAME, AS IT ALWAYS

01:41.640 --> 01:43.608
SEEMS TO, FROM RUDY GOBERT OF

01:43.675 --> 01:45.977
THE UTAH JAZZ.

01:46.044 --> 01:47.079
>> THE UTAH JAZZ BASKETBALL TEAM

01:47.145 --> 01:48.346
WILL BE QUARANTINED HERE IN

01:48.413 --> 01:49.247
OKLAHOMA CITY FOR THE

01:49.314 --> 01:50.449
FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THAT

01:50.515 --> 01:51.349
ACCORDING TO ESPN.

01:51.416 --> 01:53.518
BEFORE THE GAME, RUDY GOBERT

01:53.585 --> 01:55.554
SPOKE TO THE UTAH MEDIA, JOKING

01:55.620 --> 01:57.089
ABOUT POSSIBLY BEING SICK, AND

01:57.155 --> 01:58.490
THEN DID THIS.

01:58.557 --> 01:59.291
MAKING A POINT TO TOUCH EVERY

01:59.357 --> 02:00.892
MICROPHONE AND RECORDER.

02:00.959 --> 02:03.462
HOURS LATER, WE GOT THE NEWS

02:03.528 --> 02:04.129
THAT HE TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE

02:04.196 --> 02:06.098
CORONAVIRUS.

02:06.164 --> 02:07.032
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE HE

02:07.099 --> 02:08.066
FUCKING DID!

02:08.133 --> 02:11.303
NICE WORK, RUDY!

02:11.369 --> 02:13.171
I'D SAY THAT FEELS TOO STUPID TO

02:13.238 --> 02:15.607
ACTUALLY BE REAL, BUT LET'S

02:15.674 --> 02:16.875
REMEMBER, THIS IS ALSO THE

02:16.942 --> 02:18.944
TIMELINE IN WHICH THE OFFICIAL

02:19.010 --> 02:20.278
WHITE HOUSE TWITTER ACCOUNT ONCE

02:20.345 --> 02:22.714
TWEETED "FIRST SNOW OF THE YEAR"

02:22.781 --> 02:23.782
ON A 63‐DEGREE DAY, ON WHICH,

02:23.849 --> 02:27.652
AND THIS IS TRUE, IT DID NOT

02:27.719 --> 02:29.154
SNOW, SO HONESTLY IN MANY WAYS,

02:29.221 --> 02:29.821
WHAT RUDY GOBERT DID WAS

02:29.888 --> 02:33.725
ACTUALLY JUST STUPID ENOUGH.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.360
NOW THAT HAPPENED ON MONDAY, AND

02:35.427 --> 02:37.362
THINGS JUST SPIRALED FROM THERE.

02:37.429 --> 02:38.563
AMERICA'S MAJOR SPORTS WERE

02:38.630 --> 02:40.398
SUSPENDED, AS WAS HOCKEY.

02:40.465 --> 02:42.100
MARCH MADNESS WAS CANCELED,

02:42.167 --> 02:44.169
AND AS IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH,

02:44.236 --> 02:45.771
RITA WILSON AND HER HUSBAND,

02:45.837 --> 02:48.206
TOM ‐‐ #Feminism ‐‐ ANNOUNCED

02:48.273 --> 02:50.642
THAT THEY HAD TESTED POSITIVE

02:50.709 --> 02:51.076
FOR THE CORONAVIRUS.

02:51.143 --> 02:52.677
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED POLITICAL

02:52.744 --> 02:54.479
FIGURES FROM ALL OVER HAVE

02:54.546 --> 02:55.847
TESTED POSITIVE, TOO, INCLUDING

02:55.914 --> 02:57.783
AN IRANIAN VICE PRESIDENT,

02:57.849 --> 02:58.850
A U. K. HEALTH MINISTER, AND THE

02:58.917 --> 03:00.652
MAYOR OF MIAMI.

03:00.719 --> 03:04.322
AND THAT IS JUST AT THE TIME

03:04.389 --> 03:06.658
THAT WE ARE TAPING THIS.

03:06.725 --> 03:07.993
WE ARE CLEARLY IN THE MIDST OF A

03:08.059 --> 03:09.661
RAPIDLY ESCALATING OUTBREAK, AND

03:09.728 --> 03:10.796
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY

03:10.862 --> 03:13.231
EXACTLY WHERE THINGS STAND.

03:13.298 --> 03:15.100
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE, DESPITE

03:15.167 --> 03:17.068
TRUMP REPEATEDLY CLAIMING

03:17.135 --> 03:19.271
OTHERWISE, TESTS FOR THIS VIRUS

03:19.337 --> 03:21.773
ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE, IN MOST

03:21.840 --> 03:23.608
PLACES, TO THOSE WHO NEED THEM,

03:23.675 --> 03:26.278
WHICH MEANS THAT WE CAN'T YET

03:26.344 --> 03:29.781
PROPERLY TRACK THE VIRUS OR KNOW

03:29.848 --> 03:30.715
HOW QUICKLY IT IS SPREADING.

03:30.782 --> 03:31.683
AND THAT IS NOT ONLY

03:31.750 --> 03:32.918
CATASTROPHIC, BECAUSE WE'RE

03:32.984 --> 03:34.820
HAVING TO FLY BLIND IN FIGHTING

03:34.886 --> 03:35.320
THIS PANDEMIC, IT'S ALSO

03:35.387 --> 03:36.755
FRUSTRATING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU

03:36.822 --> 03:38.390
SEE HOW QUICKLY OTHER COUNTRIES

03:38.456 --> 03:39.925
LIKE SOUTH KOREA RAMPED UP THEIR

03:39.991 --> 03:41.459
TESTING CAPABILITIES.

03:41.526 --> 03:43.962
AND THAT IS PART OF THE REASON

03:44.029 --> 03:45.530
WHY IT WAS ACTUALLY GENUINELY

03:45.597 --> 03:46.965
REFRESHING TO HEAR THE TOP U. S.

03:47.032 --> 03:49.601
OFFICIAL ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES,

03:49.668 --> 03:51.670
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, SAY THIS ON

03:51.736 --> 03:52.838
THURSDAY ABOUT OUR CURRENT

03:52.904 --> 03:56.174
TESTING SYSTEM:

03:56.241 --> 03:58.476
>> THE SYSTEM IS NOT REALLY

03:58.543 --> 03:59.177
GEARED TO WHAT WE NEED RIGHT

03:59.244 --> 03:59.744
NOW.

03:59.811 --> 04:01.446
THAT IS A FAILING.

04:01.513 --> 04:02.214
>> A FAILING?

04:02.280 --> 04:02.848
YES.

04:02.914 --> 04:03.682
>> IT IS A FAILING.

04:03.748 --> 04:05.717
LET'S ADMIT IT.

04:05.784 --> 04:08.053
THE IDEA OF ANYBODY GETTING IT

04:08.119 --> 04:09.554
EASILY, THE WAY PEOPLE IN OTHER

04:09.621 --> 04:10.589
COUNTRIES ARE DOING IT, WE'RE

04:10.655 --> 04:11.756
NOT SET UP FOR THAT.

04:11.823 --> 04:12.557
DO I THINK WE SHOULD BE?

04:12.624 --> 04:13.892
YES.

04:13.959 --> 04:14.893
BUT WE'RE NOT.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.028
>> John: NO, WE ARE NOT.

04:17.095 --> 04:18.830
AND INCIDENTALLY, IF YOU FIND

04:18.897 --> 04:21.766
YOURSELF REALLY APPRECIATING HOW

04:21.833 --> 04:22.968
CALM, KNOWLEDGABLE, AND THOROUGH

04:23.034 --> 04:24.870
FAUCI IS, YOU'RE FRANKLY ALONE

04:24.936 --> 04:25.904
ON THAT.

04:25.971 --> 04:27.572
HE'S BEEN A RARE SOURCE OF

04:27.639 --> 04:28.907
CLARITY IN THE TRUMP

04:28.974 --> 04:29.908
ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE,

04:29.975 --> 04:31.142
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, HE'S THE

04:31.209 --> 04:32.043
NATION'S LEADING INFECTIOUS

04:32.110 --> 04:33.912
DISEASE EXPERT.

04:33.979 --> 04:35.347
NOW, IS HE MY FAVORITE

04:35.413 --> 04:37.349
INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT?

04:37.415 --> 04:39.150
NO, OF COURSE HE ISN'T, BECAUSE

04:39.217 --> 04:41.519
THAT WOULD BE SALVADOR MAZZA.

04:41.586 --> 04:43.488
IT'S AMAZING THAT, FOR A MAN WHO

04:43.555 --> 04:44.389
STUDIED INFECTIOUS DISEASES HIS

04:44.456 --> 04:46.191
WHOLE LIFE, THE ONLY THING HE

04:46.258 --> 04:48.159
EVER CAME DOWN WITH WAS A DEADLY

04:48.226 --> 04:49.928
CASE OF BEDROOM EYES.

04:49.995 --> 04:53.598
SALVADOR, STOP IT!

04:53.665 --> 04:57.469
AND LOOK, FAUCI IS IN A TOUGH

04:57.535 --> 04:57.903
POSITION RIGHT NOW.

04:57.969 --> 04:59.004
HE HAS TO BALANCE THE TASK OF

04:59.070 --> 05:00.572
COMMUNICATING REAL, HONEST

05:00.639 --> 05:02.307
SCIENCE WITH THIS

05:02.374 --> 05:03.308
ADMINISTRATION'S AVERSION TO

05:03.375 --> 05:05.143
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE WORDS.

05:05.210 --> 05:06.678
BUT SO FAR HE SEEMS TO BE DOING

05:06.745 --> 05:08.013
A GOOD JOB.

05:08.079 --> 05:09.814
THE SAME, UNFORTUNATELY, CANNOT

05:09.881 --> 05:11.750
BE SAID ABOUT TRUMP, WHO

05:11.816 --> 05:13.718
ATTEMPTED TO REASSURE THE NATION

05:13.785 --> 05:15.387
WITH A SEDATED OVAL OFFICE

05:15.453 --> 05:16.955
SPEECH ON WEDNESDAY, WHICH WAS

05:17.022 --> 05:18.723
A COMPLETE MESS.

05:18.790 --> 05:20.325
DESPITE THE FACT HE WAS READING

05:20.392 --> 05:22.060
FROM A PREPARED STATEMENT, HE

05:22.127 --> 05:23.561
MANAGED TO MISTAKENLY CLAIM THAT

05:23.628 --> 05:24.796
IMPORTS FROM EUROPE WERE BEING

05:24.863 --> 05:27.098
CUT OFF ‐‐ WHICH THEY WERE NOT;

05:27.165 --> 05:29.634
THAT INSURERS WOULD WAIVE COPAYS

05:29.701 --> 05:30.669
NOT JUST FOR TESTING, BUT FOR

05:30.735 --> 05:31.937
TREATMENT ‐‐ WHICH AT PRESENT

05:32.003 --> 05:33.438
THEY WON'T; AND HE SEEMED TO

05:33.505 --> 05:35.040
IMPLY THAT AMERICANS IN EUROPE

05:35.106 --> 05:35.941
COULD NOT GET BACK INTO THE

05:36.007 --> 05:38.643
COUNTRY ‐‐ WHICH THEY CAN.

05:38.710 --> 05:40.178
AND EVEN HE DIDN'T SEEM ENTIRELY

05:40.245 --> 05:41.513
SATISFIED WITH HIS PERFORMANCE,

05:41.579 --> 05:43.415
BECAUSE THE MOMENT THE SPEECH

05:43.481 --> 05:44.449
WAS OVER, THIS WAS HIS ACTUAL

05:44.516 --> 05:45.784
REACTION:

05:45.850 --> 05:46.518
>> WE'RE CLEAR.

05:46.584 --> 05:48.520
>> OKAY?

05:48.586 --> 05:51.690
OKAAAAY.

05:51.756 --> 05:55.694
>> John: YEP.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.762
AND THAT IS THE "OKAAAAY" OF A

05:57.829 --> 05:58.930
MAN WHO HAS JUST COMPLETED YET

05:58.997 --> 06:00.231
ANOTHER SUBSTANDARD JOB AFTER

06:00.298 --> 06:01.599
REFUSING TO PUT IN EVEN THE

06:01.666 --> 06:02.467
SLIGHTEST BIT OF EFFORT.

06:02.534 --> 06:03.668
SHE KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING

06:03.735 --> 06:05.236
ABOUT.

06:05.303 --> 06:06.571
SHE DEFINITELY KNOWS WHAT I'M

06:06.638 --> 06:08.206
TALKING ABOUT.

06:08.273 --> 06:10.442
THIS JOKE IS LANDING SO HARD

06:10.508 --> 06:12.377
WITH HER RIGHT NOW.

06:12.444 --> 06:14.079
AND FOR THE FOLLOWING DAYS,

06:14.145 --> 06:15.780
TRUMP SEEMED TO BE DOING HIS

06:15.847 --> 06:18.083
VERY BEST TO TRY AND MINIMIZE

06:18.149 --> 06:20.285
THE IMPACT OF THIS CRISIS, OFTEN

06:20.352 --> 06:21.653
WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON

06:21.720 --> 06:23.088
SHORING UP THE STOCK MARKET ‐‐

06:23.154 --> 06:24.289
A DYNAMIC PERHAPS BEST

06:24.356 --> 06:25.323
ENCAPSULATED BY THIS EXCHANGE

06:25.390 --> 06:27.592
WITH A REPORTER:

06:27.659 --> 06:28.760
>> THE MARKETS ARE GOING TO BE

06:28.827 --> 06:29.294
JUST FINE, JUST FINE.

06:29.361 --> 06:30.628
>> WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

06:30.695 --> 06:32.364
THEY'RE TANKING.

06:32.430 --> 06:34.132
>> John: OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.

06:34.199 --> 06:35.500
I HATE IT WHEN THE PRESIDENT

06:35.567 --> 06:38.003
LIES AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY,

06:38.069 --> 06:39.004
BUT WHY WOULD YOU ASK HIM,

06:39.070 --> 06:44.809
"WHY DO YOU SAY THAT"?

06:44.876 --> 06:46.611
BECAUSE THE ANSWER TO THAT IS

06:46.678 --> 06:47.579
ALWAYS, IT'S JUST WHAT HE DOES!

06:47.645 --> 06:48.713
ASKING TRUMP WHY HE SAID THINGS

06:48.780 --> 06:49.647
ARE FINE WHEN THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY

06:49.714 --> 06:51.182
NOT IS LIKE ASKING THE WIND WHY

06:51.249 --> 06:52.183
IT WHISPERS, OR WHY THE OLD

06:52.250 --> 06:53.685
REDWOOD TREE GROWS SO TALL, OR

06:53.752 --> 06:55.687
WHY THIS CORGI IS SO THICC.

06:55.754 --> 06:58.123
THAT'S JUST NATURE, BABY.

06:58.189 --> 07:00.325
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

07:00.392 --> 07:03.762
BUT AGAIN, NOTHING IS FINE HERE.

07:03.828 --> 07:05.997
THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE HAS,

07:06.064 --> 07:07.632
SADLY, BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY

07:07.699 --> 07:08.800
DISORGANIZATION AND LIES.

07:08.867 --> 07:11.236
AND THE ALL TIME LOW ‐‐

07:11.302 --> 07:12.704
SO FAR! ‐‐ CAME IN HIS

07:12.771 --> 07:13.505
ROSE GARDEN PRESS CONFERENCE

07:13.571 --> 07:15.874
ON FRIDAY.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.175
IF YOU SAW NEWS COVERAGE AFTER

07:17.242 --> 07:18.209
THE FACT, YOU MAY'VE SEEN THAT

07:18.276 --> 07:19.144
HE DECLARED A NATIONAL

07:19.210 --> 07:19.878
EMERGENCY.

07:19.944 --> 07:21.379
WHICH IS GOOD.

07:21.446 --> 07:22.647
AND IF THAT'S ALL YOU SAW OF THE

07:22.714 --> 07:23.381
PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU MIGHT'VE

07:23.448 --> 07:24.749
BEEN REASSURED.

07:24.816 --> 07:27.786
BUT IF YOU WATCHED THE WHOLE

07:27.852 --> 07:28.920
EVENT, THERE WAS A LOT THERE

07:28.987 --> 07:30.055
THAT WAS PRETTY CONCERNING.

07:30.121 --> 07:31.489
BECAUSE TRUMP ALSO,

07:31.556 --> 07:32.657
INEXPLICABLY, FELT IT IMPORTANT

07:32.724 --> 07:34.192
TO BRING UP A SERIES OF CEOs

07:34.259 --> 07:37.462
WHOSE COMPANIES WERE PROMISING

07:37.529 --> 07:39.330
TO HELP INCREASE OUR TESTING

07:39.397 --> 07:40.698
CAPABILITY, AND WHO, FOR THE

07:40.765 --> 07:44.969
RECORD, ABSOLUTELY DID NOT NEED

07:45.036 --> 07:46.071
TO BE THERE.

07:46.137 --> 07:47.038
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE FOR SOME

07:47.105 --> 07:48.173
REASON, TRUMP DEFIED EVERY

07:48.239 --> 07:49.607
PUBLIC HEALTH PROTOCOL BY

07:49.674 --> 07:50.642
SHAKING THEIR HANDS, PATTING

07:50.708 --> 07:51.876
THEIR BACKS, AND TOUCHING THE

07:51.943 --> 07:52.744
MICROPHONE AT LEAST 31 TIMES,

07:52.811 --> 07:54.412
DESPITE THE FACT HE'D BEEN

07:54.479 --> 07:56.047
EXPOSED TO PEOPLE WITH THE VIRUS

07:56.114 --> 07:57.882
HIMSELF LAST WEEKEND AT

07:57.949 --> 07:59.684
MAR‐A‐LAGO, WHERE A GROWING

07:59.751 --> 08:00.652
NUMBER OF GUESTS HAVE SINCE

08:00.718 --> 08:02.320
TESTED POSITIVE.

08:02.387 --> 08:05.423
WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS THE RARE

08:05.490 --> 08:07.459
INSTANCE OF THE WORD "POSITIVE"

08:07.525 --> 08:08.693
BEING ASSOCIATED WITH ANY

08:08.760 --> 08:11.329
EXPERIENCE AT MAR‐A‐LAGO.

08:11.396 --> 08:12.597
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST EMBLEMATIC

08:12.664 --> 08:14.632
RESPONSE WAS WHEN HE WAS ASKED

08:14.699 --> 08:15.934
ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S DISASTROUS

08:16.000 --> 08:17.502
LAG IN TESTING AND SAID,

08:17.569 --> 08:20.939
"I DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

08:21.005 --> 08:22.006
AT ALL," AND THEN HAD THIS

08:22.073 --> 08:23.608
EXCHANGE WITH A REPORTER:

08:23.675 --> 08:25.543
>> YOU SAID THAT YOU DON'T TAKE

08:25.610 --> 08:27.245
RESPONSIBILITY, BUT YOU DID

08:27.312 --> 08:28.713
DISBAND THE WHITE HOUSE PANDEMIC

08:28.780 --> 08:30.615
OFFICE, AND THE OFFICIALS THAT

08:30.682 --> 08:31.616
WERE WORKING IN THAT OFFICE LEFT

08:31.683 --> 08:33.251
THIS ADMINISTRATION ABRUPTLY.

08:33.318 --> 08:34.252
SO WHAT RESPONSIBILITY DO YOU

08:34.319 --> 08:35.386
TAKE TO THAT?

08:35.453 --> 08:36.721
AND THE OFFICIALS THAT WORKED IN

08:36.788 --> 08:37.722
THAT OFFICE SAID THAT YOU ‐‐

08:37.789 --> 08:38.490
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE LOST

08:38.556 --> 08:39.591
VALUABLE TIME BECAUSE THAT

08:39.657 --> 08:40.959
OFFICE WAS DISBANDED.

08:41.025 --> 08:42.927
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

08:42.994 --> 08:43.628
>> WELL, I JUST THINK IT'S

08:43.695 --> 08:44.395
A NASTY QUESTION.

08:44.462 --> 08:45.029
AND WHEN YOU SAY "ME,"

08:45.096 --> 08:46.598
I DIDN'T DO IT.

08:46.664 --> 08:47.999
WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE ‐‐ I

08:48.066 --> 08:49.534
COULD ‐‐ I COULD ASK, PERHAPS,

08:49.601 --> 08:51.603
IN MY ADMINISTRATION.

08:51.669 --> 08:53.004
BUT I COULD PERHAPS ASK TONY

08:53.071 --> 08:54.105
ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

08:54.172 --> 08:55.106
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

08:55.173 --> 08:56.374
I MEAN, YOU SAY ‐‐ YOU SAY WE

08:56.441 --> 08:56.941
DID THAT ‐‐ I DON'T KNOW

08:57.008 --> 08:57.842
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

08:57.909 --> 08:58.977
>> YOU ‐‐ YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT

08:59.043 --> 08:59.611
THE ‐‐ ABOUT THE REORGANIZATION

08:59.677 --> 09:00.211
THAT HAPPENED AT THE NATIONAL

09:00.278 --> 09:01.146
SECURITY COUNCIL?

09:01.212 --> 09:01.946
>> IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION,

09:02.013 --> 09:02.580
PERHAPS THEY DO THAT, YOU KNOW?

09:02.647 --> 09:04.249
PEOPLE LET PEOPLE GO.

09:04.315 --> 09:05.583
YOU USED TO BE WITH A DIFFERENT

09:05.650 --> 09:06.484
NEWSPAPER THAN YOU ARE NOW, YOU

09:06.551 --> 09:07.118
KNOW, THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN.

09:07.185 --> 09:07.886
OKAY, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

09:07.952 --> 09:09.888
>> BUT THIS IS A ‐‐

09:09.954 --> 09:11.756
>> WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.

09:11.823 --> 09:13.057
>> John: PERFECT.

09:13.124 --> 09:14.159
"I DIDN'T DO IT.

09:14.225 --> 09:15.693
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.162
MAYBE SOMEONE IN THE

09:17.228 --> 09:18.763
ADMINISTRATION DID IT.

09:18.830 --> 09:19.931
MAYBE "TONY" DID IT.

09:19.998 --> 09:22.667
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

09:22.734 --> 09:23.101
I DON'T KNOW AGAIN.

09:23.168 --> 09:26.237
WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB."

09:26.304 --> 09:26.838
THAT IS REMINISCENT OF

09:26.905 --> 09:27.805
HARRY TRUMAN'S FAMOUS SAYING,

09:27.872 --> 09:29.607
"THE BUCK STOPS ‐‐ SOMEWHERE

09:29.674 --> 09:30.141
OVER THERE MAYBE?

09:30.208 --> 09:30.708
TONY?

09:30.775 --> 09:32.977
TONY, YOU STOP THAT BUCK?

09:33.044 --> 09:34.012
YOU STOP THAT BUCK?

09:34.078 --> 09:34.479
NO?

09:34.546 --> 09:35.146
TONY PROBABLY STOPPED IT.

09:35.213 --> 09:35.880
THE POINT IS, I DON'T KNOW,

09:35.947 --> 09:38.950
LADY, I JUST WORK HERE."

09:39.017 --> 09:40.351
THAT IS A LEVEL OF DODGING

09:40.418 --> 09:41.286
RESPONSIBILITY THAT TRUMP'S BEEN

09:41.352 --> 09:42.120
PERFECTING EVER SINCE HE WAS

09:42.187 --> 09:43.421
VERY MUCH NOT IN VIETNAM.

09:43.488 --> 09:44.422
ALSO, IT FEELS IMPORTANT TO

09:44.489 --> 09:46.090
POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE

09:46.157 --> 09:47.458
MARQUEE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THAT

09:47.525 --> 09:48.526
PRESS CONFERENCE WAS THE

09:48.593 --> 09:49.594
PRESIDENT'S CLAIM THAT GOOGLE

09:49.661 --> 09:51.729
WAS RAPIDLY BUILDING A WEBSITE

09:51.796 --> 09:53.498
THAT WOULD DIRECT PEOPLE TO

09:53.565 --> 09:54.699
DRIVE‐THROUGH TESTING

09:54.766 --> 09:55.333
FACILITIES, WHICH SOUNDS

09:55.400 --> 09:58.736
FANTASTIC.

09:58.803 --> 10:01.039
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, GOOGLE

10:01.105 --> 10:02.207
QUICKLY CLARIFIED THE SITE

10:02.273 --> 10:03.741
"IS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

10:03.808 --> 10:05.443
DEVELOPMENT" WITH PLANS TO ROLL

10:05.510 --> 10:07.245
OUT TESTING IN THE BAY AREA AND

10:07.312 --> 10:08.846
MAYBE EXPAND IT MORE BROADLY

10:08.913 --> 10:10.014
OVER TIME.

10:10.081 --> 10:11.583
SO IN TERMS OF IMMEDIATE HELP,

10:11.649 --> 10:13.384
THAT WEBSITE IS ABOUT AS

10:13.451 --> 10:14.886
EFFECTIVE AS GOING TO

10:14.953 --> 10:16.888
IsThisACat.com.

10:16.955 --> 10:21.226
IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS

10:21.292 --> 10:22.360
WEBSITE, YOU CAN SIMPLY UPLOAD A

10:22.427 --> 10:23.194
PHOTO, AND IT'LL TELL YOU WITH A

10:23.261 --> 10:23.928
SIMPLE "YES" OR "NO" IF THE

10:23.995 --> 10:24.629
THING YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS A CAT

10:24.696 --> 10:25.296
OR NOT.

10:25.363 --> 10:26.064
SEE THAT?

10:26.130 --> 10:27.665
THE WEBSITE KNOWS IT'S A CAT.

10:27.732 --> 10:28.366
NOW, WHEN I UPLOADED A PICTURE

10:28.433 --> 10:30.268
OF A DOG?

10:30.335 --> 10:32.370
THE WEBSITE SAYS "NO."

10:32.437 --> 10:33.805
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD

10:33.871 --> 10:34.672
WEBSITE.

10:34.739 --> 10:35.740
NOW, WILL IT TELL YOU WHERE THE

10:35.807 --> 10:36.674
DRIVE‐THROUGH TESTING LOCATIONS

10:36.741 --> 10:37.508
ARE?

10:37.575 --> 10:40.545
NO, BUT FOR THE TIME BEING,

10:40.612 --> 10:42.313
NEITHER WILL TRUMP'S GOOGLE

10:42.380 --> 10:44.282
THING, SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL

10:44.349 --> 10:45.283
SPEND YOUR TIME LOOKING AT

10:45.350 --> 10:46.050
THINGS THAT ARE AND ARE NOT

10:46.117 --> 10:46.784
CATS.

10:46.851 --> 10:48.686
LOOK, THIS IS CLEARLY BOTH

10:48.753 --> 10:52.590
FRUSTRATING AND EXTREMELY

10:52.657 --> 10:53.958
UNNERVING, AND IT'S ACTIVELY

10:54.025 --> 10:54.926
CONTRIBUTING TO A SENSE OF

10:54.993 --> 10:55.793
CONFUSION IN THE COUNTRY

10:55.860 --> 10:56.861
AT THE MOMENT.

10:56.928 --> 11:01.466
AND AT THIS POINT, IT MIGHT BE

11:01.532 --> 11:02.600
BEST FOR US TO PUT THE PRESIDENT

11:02.667 --> 11:03.134
ASIDE.

11:03.201 --> 11:03.901
DON'T WORRY ‐‐ THERE IS GOING TO

11:03.968 --> 11:04.836
BE AMPLE TIME TO BE UTTERLY

11:04.902 --> 11:05.970
FURIOUS WITH HIM LATER.

11:06.037 --> 11:08.773
BUT THE FACT IS, EVEN THOUGH

11:08.840 --> 11:11.276
THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE, IT

11:11.342 --> 11:13.344
SEEMS WE'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE

11:13.411 --> 11:14.579
BIT ON OUR OWN HERE, AND BECAUSE

11:14.646 --> 11:15.680
OF THAT, IT MIGHT BE WORTH GOING

11:15.747 --> 11:18.049
OVER SOME BASIC RULES THAT

11:18.116 --> 11:20.351
HEALTH EXPERTS SAY WE SHOULD ALL

11:20.418 --> 11:21.619
ABSOLUTELY BE FOLLOWING TO HELP

11:21.686 --> 11:23.354
STEM THIS OUTBREAK.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.922
INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN DOING

11:24.989 --> 11:26.424
THEIR BEST TO SPREAD GOOD

11:26.491 --> 11:27.425
INFORMATION ONLINE, INCLUDING

11:27.492 --> 11:29.961
A NUMBER OF SOCIAL MEDIA

11:30.028 --> 11:31.462
CELEBRITIES ON TIKTOK, NONE MORE

11:31.529 --> 11:34.232
DELIGHTFUL THAN THIS ONE:

11:34.299 --> 11:36.634
>> ♪ IT'S CORONA TIME ♪

11:36.701 --> 11:37.769
♪ HEY, IT'S CORONA TIME

11:37.835 --> 11:43.374
RIGHT NOW ♪

11:43.441 --> 11:48.946
♪ IT'S CORONA TIME ♪

11:49.013 --> 11:49.747
>> John: I MEAN, THAT IS

11:49.814 --> 11:50.782
EXCELLENT.

11:50.848 --> 11:51.716
THAT TIKTOK HAMSTER IS NOW MY

11:51.783 --> 11:52.550
FAVORITE THING IN THE WORLD.

11:52.617 --> 11:53.418
AND YES, I FULLY UNDERSTAND I

11:53.484 --> 11:54.919
HAVE A WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN,

11:54.986 --> 11:56.154
BUT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN:

11:56.220 --> 11:57.221
THAT TIKTOK HAMSTER IS MY

11:57.288 --> 12:00.825
FAVORITE THING IN THE WORLD.

12:00.892 --> 12:03.394
AND IT IS TRULY SAD THAT THAT

12:03.461 --> 12:04.762
HAMSTER GENUINELY OFFERED MORE

12:04.829 --> 12:06.597
USEFUL PUBLIC HEALTH ADVICE IN

12:06.664 --> 12:08.333
ONE 12‐SECOND TIKTOK THAN THE

12:08.399 --> 12:09.834
PRESIDENT HAS IN MULTIPLE

12:09.901 --> 12:12.103
ADDRESSES TO THE NATION.

12:12.170 --> 12:15.506
AND LET'S ACTUALLY GO OVER WHAT

12:15.573 --> 12:16.808
THAT VERY WISE BALL OF FLUFF WAS

12:16.874 --> 12:17.442
TELLING US:

12:17.508 --> 12:18.276
FIRST, WASH YOUR HANDS FOR

12:18.343 --> 12:21.312
AT LEAST 20 SECONDS.

12:21.379 --> 12:22.146
THAT'S REALLY GOOD ADVICE.

12:22.213 --> 12:23.014
IT'S BASICALLY THE TIME IT TAKES

12:23.081 --> 12:23.581
TO SING "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" TO

12:23.648 --> 12:24.816
OPRAH TWICE.

12:24.882 --> 12:26.718
SO IT'S TIME WELL SPENT.

12:26.784 --> 12:29.187
SECOND, MAKE SURE YOU COUGH AND

12:29.253 --> 12:31.022
SNEEZE INTO A TISSUE, YOUR

12:31.089 --> 12:32.957
ELBOW, OR YOUR UPPER SLEEVE ‐‐

12:33.024 --> 12:34.759
NOT YOUR HAND ‐‐ AND DISINFECT

12:34.826 --> 12:35.626
FREQUENTLY TOUCHED SURFACES

12:35.693 --> 12:37.495
DAILY.

12:37.562 --> 12:40.431
THIRD, WEAR MASKS ONLY IF YOU

12:40.498 --> 12:42.433
HAVE SYMPTOMS OR ARE A

12:42.500 --> 12:44.168
CAREGIVER, AS IT'S IMPORTANT

12:44.235 --> 12:46.270
THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM

12:46.337 --> 12:47.772
AVAILABLE FOR MEDICAL

12:47.839 --> 12:48.740
PROFESSIONALS AND THOSE WITH

12:48.806 --> 12:50.742
RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS.

12:50.808 --> 12:52.143
AND FINALLY, STAY HOME,

12:52.210 --> 12:54.712
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SICK,

12:54.779 --> 12:58.182
BUT ALSO IF YOU'RE NOT.

12:58.249 --> 13:00.184
THAT LAST ONE IS PART OF WHAT'S

13:00.251 --> 13:02.019
CALLED "SOCIAL DISTANCING" ‐‐

13:02.086 --> 13:03.321
OR, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT IT

13:03.388 --> 13:04.889
ON TWITTER WITH ALL CAPS AND

13:04.956 --> 13:06.424
NO FURTHER EXPLANATION, "SOCIAL

13:06.491 --> 13:11.596
DISTANCING," EXCLAMATION MARK!

13:11.662 --> 13:14.632
AND HERE'S THE THING,

13:14.699 --> 13:15.833
HE MAKES A FINE POINT, BUT

13:15.900 --> 13:18.603
IF I MAY JUST EXPAND ON THAT

13:18.669 --> 13:19.337
SCREAM TWEET A LITTLE,

13:19.404 --> 13:19.971
SOCIAL DISTANCING IS ABSOLUTELY

13:20.037 --> 13:21.005
CRUCIAL RIGHT NOW.

13:21.072 --> 13:23.174
THE IDEA IS TO AVOID

13:23.241 --> 13:25.042
CROWDED PLACES, CANCEL SOCIAL

13:25.109 --> 13:26.911
ENGAGEMENTS, AVOID UNNECESSARY

13:26.978 --> 13:29.714
TRAVEL, WORK FROM HOME IF THAT

13:29.781 --> 13:31.115
IS AN OPTION FOR YOU, AND ‐‐ IF

13:31.182 --> 13:32.350
YOU NEED TO BUY GROCERIES OR USE

13:32.417 --> 13:33.785
PUBLIC TRANSIT ‐‐ TRY TO DO IT

13:33.851 --> 13:35.920
AT OFF‐PEAK TIMES.

13:35.987 --> 13:38.322
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S NOT ALL

13:38.389 --> 13:40.024
FEASIBLE FOR EVERYONE, BUT IF

13:40.091 --> 13:44.128
YOU TRULY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

13:44.195 --> 13:46.063
GO OUT, IT IS VITAL TO PROTECT

13:46.130 --> 13:47.098
YOURSELF AND OTHERS BY KEEPING

13:47.165 --> 13:48.466
A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST SIX FEET

13:48.533 --> 13:49.967
FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

13:50.034 --> 13:51.869
BASICALLY, FOR THE TIME BEING,

13:51.936 --> 13:53.971
PRETEND YOU'RE A BRITISH PARENT

13:54.038 --> 13:55.573
AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD

13:55.640 --> 13:56.808
IS YOUR CHILD.

13:56.874 --> 13:59.010
KEEP AS MUCH DISTANCE AS YOU

13:59.076 --> 14:00.311
CAN, AVOID PHYSICAL CONTACT

14:00.378 --> 14:02.780
AT ALL COSTS, AND IF ANY ONE OF

14:02.847 --> 14:03.514
THEM TRY TO GIVE YOU A HUG,

14:03.581 --> 14:05.817
REJECT IT.

14:05.883 --> 14:07.518
THE REASON WHY SOCIAL DISTANCING

14:07.585 --> 14:10.321
IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE

14:10.388 --> 14:11.722
IT CAN HELP US "FLATTEN THE

14:11.789 --> 14:13.558
CURVE" ‐‐ IT'S A PHRASE YOU'VE

14:13.624 --> 14:16.427
PROBABLY HEARD A LOT THIS WEEK

14:16.494 --> 14:17.929
WHICH MEANS BASICALLY THIS:

14:17.995 --> 14:19.464
SLOW THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS

14:19.530 --> 14:20.765
SO WE DON'T OVERWHELM THE

14:20.832 --> 14:22.633
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.735
WE ONLY HAVE SO MANY VENTILATORS

14:24.802 --> 14:26.437
AND HOSPITAL BEDS, AND IF CASES

14:26.504 --> 14:27.605
SPIKE ALL AT ONCE, THEY COULD

14:27.672 --> 14:30.708
MAX OUT OUR CAPACITY.

14:30.775 --> 14:34.445
AND I KNOW THERE'S A TEMPTATION

14:34.512 --> 14:35.646
TO THINK, "HOLD ON,

14:35.713 --> 14:36.581
THIS IS AMERICA,

14:36.647 --> 14:37.782
I'M SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH

14:37.849 --> 14:38.416

14:38.483 --> 14:39.050

14:39.116 --> 14:42.019
WE DON'T.

14:42.086 --> 14:43.254
WE REALLY DON'T.

14:43.321 --> 14:45.256
SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE NEED

14:45.323 --> 14:46.991
TO SPREAD CASES OUT OVER

14:47.058 --> 14:48.493
A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT

14:48.559 --> 14:49.660
EVERYONE WHO NEEDS CARE

14:49.727 --> 14:51.329
CAN GET IT.

14:51.395 --> 14:53.564
AND YES, PROPER SOCIAL

14:53.631 --> 14:55.466
DISTANCING INVOLVES SOME

14:55.533 --> 14:57.235
SACRIFICE, BUT THIS IS

14:57.301 --> 14:58.936
A CRITICAL THING THAT WE SHOULD

14:59.003 --> 15:00.204
ALL DO FOR THE MORE VULNERABLE

15:00.271 --> 15:02.907
AMONG US AND FOR HEALTHCARE

15:04.742 --> 15:07.245
THE SHIT FOR SOME TIME TO COME.

15:07.311 --> 15:09.280
FOR AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT LOOKS

15:09.347 --> 15:12.683
LIKE WHEN YOU DO NOT FLATTEN THE

15:12.750 --> 15:14.352
CURVE, JUST LOOK TO THE HARDEST

15:16.087 --> 15:17.255
HAVE SO OVERWHELMED THE SYSTEM

15:17.321 --> 15:18.589

15:18.656 --> 15:19.590
DIFFICULT CHOICES ABOUT WHO GETS

15:19.657 --> 15:20.825
POTENTIALLY LIFE‐SAVING

15:20.892 --> 15:24.161
TREATMENT AND WHO DOESN'T.

15:24.228 --> 15:26.163
AND IN ADDITION TO ATTEMPTING TO

15:26.230 --> 15:27.965
QUELL THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS,

15:28.032 --> 15:31.569
WE SHOULD ALSO BE DOING

15:31.636 --> 15:33.971
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO

CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF

15:34.605 --> 15:35.673

AROUND.

15:38.709 --> 15:40.011

15:40.077 --> 15:42.146
SUGGESTED THAT HIS TOOTHPASTE

"KILLS THE WHOLE SARS‐CORONA

15:43.915 --> 15:45.850

15:45.917 --> 15:48.886
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT DID!

15:48.953 --> 15:52.523
I WOULD LOVE IT IF HIS

15:52.590 --> 15:53.558
TOOTHPASTE DID THAT.

BUT...

15:54.425 --> 15:55.226
Y'KNOW...

15:55.293 --> 15:56.227
IT DOESN'T.

15:56.294 --> 15:57.161
THERE'S MULTIPLE COMMENTATORS
