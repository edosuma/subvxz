00:03.737 --> 00:06.540
[theme music]

00:10.978 --> 00:14.148
I'm never shopping
again on Christmas Eve.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.184
Was there anything
even left on the shelves?

00:16.217 --> 00:17.151
Oh, tons.

00:17.185 --> 00:20.754
DJ's getting 1,000 q-tips.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.557
No reason, just
'cause I love him.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.927
Well, at least you got
him something off his list.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.764
You know, Mom, I was thinking,
and I decided that I really

00:30.798 --> 00:31.965
don't want to be
there to, you know,

00:31.999 --> 00:34.602
interrupt your reunion
with Becky and Nana Mary.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.270
Forget about it, Darlene.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.906
The entire family's got
to be together tonight.

00:38.939 --> 00:42.009
And no matter how many blood
tests I take to disprove it,

00:42.042 --> 00:45.513
you're a member of this family.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.181
I won't be that late,
it's just that, you know,

00:47.215 --> 00:49.583
David's parents are leaving.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.786
And he has to babysit his
little sisters all alone.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.824
All alone, on Christmas Eve.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.727
I'll give you 5 bucks.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.296
You're gonna miss
"It's a Wonderful Life."

01:02.330 --> 01:05.099
Well, it's on again
9:00 and 9:30 and 11:00

01:05.133 --> 01:07.401
and at midnight in Spanish.

01:07.435 --> 01:11.172
[speaking spanish]

01:11.205 --> 01:13.274
OK, but you be home by 8:00.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.608
And for every
minute you're late,

01:14.642 --> 01:16.277
that's another time
you've got to listen to

01:16.310 --> 01:19.947
"It's a Jim Nabors Christmas."

01:19.980 --> 01:21.582
Hold it.
- What?

01:21.615 --> 01:22.450
The 5 bucks.

01:26.354 --> 01:30.191
This way she doesn't have
to be racked with guilt.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.024
Roseanne.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.696
Why, are you
gonna be late too?

01:35.729 --> 01:37.898
No, I'm not comin' at all.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.899
It's just, I--

01:43.737 --> 01:46.674
I'm sorry, but Fisher
and I are a new couple,

01:46.707 --> 01:50.544
and we're just trying
to develop some us time.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.879
Oh, god!

01:51.912 --> 01:54.014
That's totally gross.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.883
That is your therapist talking.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.118
No, it couldn't be, because I
stopped going to my therapist.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.019
Why?

01:59.052 --> 02:01.054
You can't be cured.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.523
Fisher says I don't
need it anymore.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.425
He says I'm able to
make my own decisions.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.827
Hey, I'll be the one to tell
you when you're able to make

02:06.860 --> 02:08.362
your own decisions.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.865
Stop harping on
my driving, Mother.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.234
You pump the break.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.769
When there's ice and snow on
the road, you pump the brake!

02:15.803 --> 02:17.070
I was pumping it.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.873
Oh, pump this.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.074
Oh, hello, girls.

02:21.108 --> 02:25.246
Look, a freakin'
white Christmas!

02:25.279 --> 02:28.649
[laughs] How are you doin'?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.984
Oh, enormous corns.

02:31.018 --> 02:35.256
Here, Roseanne, take
off my boats, please.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.790
Oh.
[groans]

02:36.824 --> 02:38.091
All right.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.561
So now you have had these
off in the last year, right?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.363
Mhm.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.799
Look at that, completely dry.

02:45.833 --> 02:50.504
When-- when I wear baggies on
my feet, they're dry as a bone.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.872
Jackie, here, feel my feet.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.274
No, I'm all right.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.642
Oh, come on.
Feel my feet.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.543
Go on, Jackie.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.445
You know you want to.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.780
Yeah, that's dry.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.815
Baggies!

03:01.849 --> 03:05.419
I think I felt a corn.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.488
Come on, Mother, let
me show you the kitchen.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.589
Come on, come on, dear.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.391
Oh, I can't wait.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.693
Dear diary, what did I do today?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.127
Today I looked at a kitchen.

03:16.930 --> 03:20.868
You're not leaving me alone
with the Judds tonight, Jackie.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.771
[theme music]

04:06.013 --> 04:08.916
[laughs]

04:13.987 --> 04:16.657
OK, Deej, what does Mom's
card say we're supposed to do.

04:16.690 --> 04:21.194
Put turkey in oven, turn
oven on, close oven door.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.095
Great.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.764
I guess so.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.598
Let's do it.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.539
Man, I hate cookin'.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.506
Me too.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.507
NANCY: Yoo hoo!

04:33.541 --> 04:34.475
Happy holidays!

04:34.508 --> 04:36.377
- Hi, guys.
- How's it goin'?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.312
We're spent.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.914
Question, Nance, is
there any circumstance

04:40.948 --> 04:43.984
under which you would ice
and then oil a potato?

04:44.017 --> 04:44.918
No.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.687
OK, then that
is slice and boil.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.755
DJ, go wash your hands.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.624
You're smudging the cards.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.092
Where do you want
me to put the gifts?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.093
Oh, in the living room.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.728
Did you guys bring
your presents too?

04:54.762 --> 04:55.829
Oh, that's OK.

04:55.863 --> 04:59.933
We already gave each
other our gifts earlier.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.670
Uh, DJ, would you-- hey, how
about grabbing the rock salt,

05:02.703 --> 05:03.937
going out and
salting the driveway.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.106
OK.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.675
Would you guys cool
it with the, you know,

05:07.708 --> 05:10.077
giving each other presents,
in front of the kids?

05:10.110 --> 05:12.279
What?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.849
I got her some earrings
and she gave me a sweater.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.785
Yeah.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.687
That's what I meant.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.456
I don't want him to be jealous.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.492
It's cool, Dan, I get it.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.094
We, um, we know how
hard you've been trying

05:27.127 --> 05:29.229
to deal with all of this,
and I just want you to know

05:29.262 --> 05:31.765
we really appreciate it.

05:31.799 --> 05:37.638
Yeah You know, some
guys wouldn't know--

05:37.671 --> 05:38.906
who wants a beer?

05:38.939 --> 05:39.840
I'll get 'em.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.576
[phone ringing]

05:44.077 --> 05:45.345
Hello?

05:45.379 --> 05:49.016
Hey, Beck, where are ya?

05:49.049 --> 05:52.085
Oh, no, you're kidding.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.454
I'm just glad you
guys were smart enough

05:53.487 --> 05:54.354
to get off the road.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.355
Give me the number of the motel.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.494
No, yeah, I'll tell
her you can't make it.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.595
Sure.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.897
We can just send the
gifts to each other.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.567
Of course, we were gonna
get you that washer

06:06.600 --> 06:08.201
and dryer and that speedboat.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.337
That'll be kind of hard to ship.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.441
You guys got one of
those dancing beer cans?

06:13.474 --> 06:14.341
OK.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.676
Yeah.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.478
Well, we're gonna miss you too.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.246
Yeah, bye.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.281
Oh, hey, listen,
Beck, yeah, well,

06:21.314 --> 06:22.750
tell me about that
apartment of yours, yeah?

06:22.783 --> 06:24.084
No kidding, burned down?

06:24.117 --> 06:25.285
Boy, that's a shame.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.626
Oh, Dan, you
know Becky could be

06:32.660 --> 06:34.728
here if she really wanted to.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.096
Did you tell her
we're having Stovetop?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.301
Yeah, OK.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.703
Bye.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.137
What happened?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.840
Oh, Becky got snowed
here in Wisconsin.

06:46.874 --> 06:47.941
Oh, no.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.376
I don't think we're
going anywhere either.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.512
They haven't plowed yet,
and the cars are buried.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.813
Oh, man.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.483
Oh, I'm going out to the
car and-- and get our stuff.

06:55.516 --> 06:59.553
I mean, it's times like these
when people start looting.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.421
Beverly, come on.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.290
Slow down, mother.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.825
Yeah, remember your age.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.027
You've got a daughter
in a retirement home.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.199
Thanks a lot, Roseanne, had
to make us stay and work late,

07:12.232 --> 07:13.366
didn't you?

07:13.400 --> 07:15.068
I hope you know you
ruined my entire evening.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.169
What about me?

07:16.203 --> 07:17.404
I wanted to be with
my loved ones tonight,

07:17.437 --> 07:20.440
and I got stuck with you guys.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.376
Oh, I see what's going on.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.445
You're gonna spend all
night ragging on everybody

07:25.479 --> 07:26.947
and making them miserable.
Sure.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.115
Fun for you.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.785
What about the rest of us?

07:31.819 --> 07:34.354
Ooh!

07:34.387 --> 07:36.256
What happened?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.492
Apparently I didn't
move fast enough

07:38.526 --> 07:40.293
for her, so she shoved my--

07:40.327 --> 07:41.762
how'd you put it, mother?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.865
My big butt into a snow bank.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.968
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.670
Roseanne, where did
you hide the scotch?

08:13.460 --> 08:16.196
The coast is clear
for a little while.

08:16.229 --> 08:21.769
Can this be, you
know, the night?

08:21.802 --> 08:22.770
I don't know.

08:22.803 --> 08:26.139
Why don't we just
see what happens?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.541
Because nothing
ever does happen,

08:27.575 --> 08:28.809
and it's frustrating
as hell, Darlene.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.280
What are you doing?

08:33.313 --> 08:36.984
What you want, nothing.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.219
So what, now we can't
even kiss unless I'm

08:39.252 --> 08:40.554
ready to go all the way?

08:40.588 --> 08:41.555
I don't know.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.890
Why don't we just
see what happens?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.162
What are you doing?
- Forget this.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.363
I'm out of here.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.398
Fine, you want to go?

08:51.431 --> 08:52.232
Go.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.670
Oh, Merry Christmas.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.477
COUPLE (ON TV):
(SINGING) Buffalo girls,

09:04.511 --> 09:05.512
can't you come up tonight?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.546
Can't you come up tonight?

09:06.580 --> 09:07.781
Can't you come up tonight?

09:12.953 --> 09:13.854
All right, I'm back.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.525
Don't get excited.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.127
I basically chose
you over death.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.574
I don't care, Darlene.

09:34.608 --> 09:35.575
There's no adult there.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.377
I want you to go home right now.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.080
Come on, Mom, you know I vowed
never to use my teleportation

09:40.113 --> 09:43.283
powers for personal gain.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.318
Trust me, David
and I are fighting.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.354
Nothing's gonna happen tonight.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.723
All right, dammit, but
don't you stay up too late.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.258
Remember what I told
you about Santa's

09:51.291 --> 09:52.660
elves and their pointy shoes.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.463
Bye.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.702
Wow, it's beginning to
look a lot like crap.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.240
Roseanne, if I gave
you your presents now,

10:07.274 --> 10:08.141
would you shut up?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.476
BOTH: Yay!

10:09.509 --> 10:10.577
Presents!

10:10.610 --> 10:12.345
Bring me those bags.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.180
Here.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.888
Wow, oh my god!

10:20.921 --> 10:22.022
This is awesome.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.590
It's some real expensive camera.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.625
Look at this,
a portable phone!

10:25.659 --> 10:27.160
Wrong presents.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.963
Crap.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.333
Uh, uh, these are for
Aunt Sonia's kids.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.368
Here, yours are over there.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.180
Oh, wow, a salad spinner.

10:49.883 --> 10:54.121
And a cutting board in
the shape of a rooster.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.623
Well, I don't mean to
sound ungrateful or anything,

10:56.656 --> 11:00.994
but these gifts suck.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.563
Sonia's kids got all
that really cool stuff.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.565
I thought we were your
favorite grandkids.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.466
You are.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.401
You are.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.804
Eventually,
eventually, I'm gonna

11:10.838 --> 11:13.573
have to go live with somebody.

11:13.606 --> 11:17.410
Uh, they've got a pool.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.914
Well, just promise us
that you'll linger long

11:20.948 --> 11:23.516
enough to be a huge burden.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.818
That reminds me.

11:24.852 --> 11:30.991
Made last week I saw
your dead grandpa Marvin.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.826
He looked wonderful.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.704
When do we get to
open some presents?

11:44.738 --> 11:45.605
Oh, come on, Deej.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.706
We made a deal.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.675
No opening presents
till everyone gets here.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.744
Oh, Dan, you know,
when I was a kid,

11:50.778 --> 11:54.247
my folks always let me open
just one present early.

11:54.281 --> 11:58.485
Yeah, well, I bet
your folks loved you.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.920
All right, you little mooch.

11:59.953 --> 12:00.821
Yes!

12:00.854 --> 12:01.654
Just one.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.961
Clothes.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.330
Clothes.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.565
Clothes.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.601
Great, now I can
invite all my friends

12:14.634 --> 12:17.637
over to play with my bathrobe.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.140
You know what, DJ,
let's open up our gift.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.274
I bet you're gonna like it.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.109
OK.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.347
Cool!

12:27.380 --> 12:28.515
A remote-control car!

12:28.548 --> 12:29.416
Thank you!

12:29.449 --> 12:31.118
All right.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.085
Out of here.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.286
[laughter]

12:34.354 --> 12:36.423
So Dan, where'd
you stash the toys,

12:36.456 --> 12:37.757
in the closet or the garage?

12:37.791 --> 12:38.826
Neither, those are toys.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.894
We wrapped them in clothes.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.329
[buzzer]

12:44.397 --> 12:46.800
Eh, I guess it's tough
raising a kid, huh?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.201
Yeah, well, I guess
that's something you

12:48.235 --> 12:50.103
won't have to worry about, huh?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.204
What does that mean?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.073
Oh, you know, about
having kids and all.

12:53.106 --> 12:53.974
I wanna have kids.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.508
You do?

12:55.542 --> 12:58.979
Well, then, you kind of
ruined your chance, I mean,

12:59.012 --> 13:00.347
with Arnie and all.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.782
Well, I don't think that was
exactly the right situation

13:02.816 --> 13:03.716
to have a kid in, you know?

13:03.750 --> 13:04.952
Yeah.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.553
Who wants to shave the back
of a six-month-old baby?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.458
You know, I think it
might be the right time now.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.793
I mean, I know it's early in
our relationship, but you know,

13:13.827 --> 13:15.162
at some point, I
think Marla and I can

13:15.195 --> 13:16.196
get pregnant and have a baby.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.034
Can you explain to me
how you could do that

13:21.068 --> 13:23.303
without being at all specific?

13:23.336 --> 13:25.072
Sure, Dan, it's easy.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.306
You just get some sperm--

13:26.339 --> 13:27.140
Too specific.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.978
Here, you finish.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.354
Oh, come on!

13:41.388 --> 13:43.656
You really think Grandpa
Marvin would come all the way

13:43.690 --> 13:45.125
back from his grave
just to ask Nana

13:45.158 --> 13:48.795
where his brown slacks are?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.798
I think your Nana's
just plain losing it.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.433
Ha.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.603
All this talk about an
afterlife is nonsense.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.906
When you're gone, you're gone.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.507
The end.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.841
Oh, I saw what?

14:01.875 --> 14:03.410
Next thing you know, you're
gonna tell me that you don't

14:03.443 --> 14:04.577
believe in God anymore neither.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.817
Well, is that a yes or a no?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.653
Well, I'm sorry,
Roseanne, but 25

14:13.686 --> 14:18.391
years of your husband cheating
tends to shake your faith.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.929
Man, you'd think
somebody with a lousy life

14:21.962 --> 14:23.897
like yours would believe more.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.266
Can we just drop this, please?

14:26.299 --> 14:28.135
No, we can't just drop this.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.637
You think you're the only person
that's been through stuff?

14:30.670 --> 14:31.972
I've been through stuff.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.908
But, you know, but I still
believe in God, you know?

14:34.942 --> 14:39.346
I mean, I'd like to believe that
all the horrible, hideous crap

14:39.379 --> 14:42.882
that I have to wallow through
every single day of my life

14:42.916 --> 14:45.385
that at some point I
will find out the meaning

14:45.418 --> 14:47.454
to and the reason for.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.356
I mean, so I can be happy,
you know what I mean?

14:49.389 --> 14:52.125
And I-- there just
is a God, there is!

14:52.159 --> 14:53.860
I swear to God there's a God.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.330
And if there ain't,
I've been screwed!

14:57.364 --> 15:01.935
Why are we talking about this
God in heaven and everything?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.336
It's Christmas!

15:08.908 --> 15:10.210
No, it isn't.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.180
It's just another screwed up
day, the most screwed up day

15:13.213 --> 15:14.881
the screwed up family ever has.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.084
Everybody's everywhere
doing everything.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.718
Nobody's doing
anything together.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.253
And the only person
that makes any effort

15:20.287 --> 15:23.190
at all to be with this family is
Grandpa Marvin, and he's dead.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.395
Well, let's do
something festive.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.229
Right, Nana Mary?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.001
Nana Mary?

15:37.971 --> 15:38.905
[snores]

15:38.938 --> 15:40.173
Geez.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.842
Oh my god, that would have
been really spooky timing.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.415
I think we're
scaring ourselves.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.518
I suggest we try
to get some sleep.

15:51.551 --> 15:55.688
Roseanne, I know how to get
you back in the holiday spirit.

15:55.722 --> 15:56.589
How?

15:56.623 --> 15:57.790
Let's decorate Nana Mary.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.130
We can't do that!

16:03.163 --> 16:05.065
She's our grandmother,
don't you remember?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.533
S-- salad spinner.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.871
I'll get the tinsel.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.080
Girls!

16:20.113 --> 16:24.784
Stop that, you're being
stupid and childish.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.087
Everyone knows you string
lights from the top.

16:47.774 --> 16:48.841
What's this?

16:48.875 --> 16:49.909
I bought it for you.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.344
You might as well open it.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.912
Oh, yeah, right.

16:52.945 --> 16:53.746
Here.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.559
Oh, wow, these are like
professional drawing pens.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.661
I can't keep these.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.663
Whoa, a real animation cell.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.831
This must've cost a bundle.

17:11.864 --> 17:12.665
Thanks.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.136
Ah!

17:16.169 --> 17:18.371
It's snowing like a
banshee out there.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.274
It took me an hour
to walk two blocks.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.442
Hi, Mrs. Healy.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.676
Darlene.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.846
I wasn't expecting you here.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.248
Yeah, I kind of
got stuck here.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.816
I hope you don't
mind if I sleep over.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.484
Well, isn't that convenient?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.353
[phone ringing]

17:34.387 --> 17:36.289
Hello?

17:36.323 --> 17:37.190
Hi, Dad.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.091
Yeah.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.427
She just got home.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.529
Hi, honey.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.764
No, I was at work.

17:44.797 --> 17:45.665
Really?

17:45.698 --> 17:48.034
When did you call?

17:48.067 --> 17:51.371
Oh, well, I got finished early,
and I went to Maggie's and I

17:51.404 --> 17:53.973
just got here.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.642
What are you doing,
checking up on me?

17:55.675 --> 17:56.609
Look, fine.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.744
You don't believe it?

17:57.777 --> 17:58.645
I'm sick of this.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.780
OK?

18:00.813 --> 18:03.082
How many times
your father call?

18:03.116 --> 18:05.918
He hasn't.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.220
But Aunt Maggie called.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.055
She's been looking
for you all night.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.923
Well, we all know
she's full of it.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.425
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.726
The woman doesn't
know what's happening

18:13.760 --> 18:16.296
one minute to the next.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.664
Sure, Mom.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.732
What, you're
calling me a liar?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.401
No, I just said
that she called.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.869
What the hell do you care?

18:22.902 --> 18:24.904
You really want to know
what I was doing tonight?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.573
Because I will tell you.
- Shut up, Mom.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.574
Don't you tell me to shut up!

18:27.607 --> 18:28.541
This is my house.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.042
Why'd you even come home?

18:30.076 --> 18:32.545
You apologize!

18:32.579 --> 18:34.781
You apologize to me!

18:34.814 --> 18:36.483
I'm sorry.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.850
Telling me what
to do when you've

18:37.884 --> 18:42.355
got your little girlfriend
spending the night?

18:42.389 --> 18:44.724
Dragging Conner trash over here.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.359
Another slut just
like her sister.

18:56.736 --> 18:57.837
Darlene, I'm-- I'm sorry.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.976
Hey.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.044
"Slut" didn't bother me.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.682
"Just like her sister"
part that hurt.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.196
MAN (ON TV): Merry Christmas!

19:23.230 --> 19:24.697
WOMAN (ON TV): Merry Christmas!

19:24.731 --> 19:26.666
MAN (ON TV): Merry
Christmas to us!

19:26.699 --> 19:29.669
Merry Christmas for the owls!

19:29.702 --> 19:33.640
Merry Christmas, for Anne!

19:33.673 --> 19:37.577
[romantic music]

19:44.651 --> 19:47.019
A tape, Mom, great!

19:47.053 --> 19:50.189
"Those Glorious
Hollywood Musicals."

19:50.223 --> 19:51.391
I hope you don't have it.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.096
Not this volume.

19:57.129 --> 20:00.066
Good, I had an
awful time finding it.

20:00.099 --> 20:03.069
Isn't it funny that that
one special gift you're

20:03.102 --> 20:05.972
looking for always happens
to be at the very last car

20:06.005 --> 20:09.442
wash you go to?

20:09.476 --> 20:11.143
That explains my
windshield compass.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.017
So what time did
Nancy and Marla leave?

20:18.050 --> 20:21.220
About an hour ago, after
their sixth encounter

20:21.254 --> 20:23.623
under the mistletoe.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.991
Well, you know
what they say, Dan.

20:25.024 --> 20:30.497
Every time lesbians kiss,
another angel gets her wings.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.398
Morning.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.599
Hey, everybody, how's it going?

20:32.632 --> 20:33.500
Hey, Nana Mary.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.302
Hello, Darlene, here.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.369
Here, you get over here.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.970
We're opening presents.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.439
How was your night?

20:39.472 --> 20:40.473
Oh, it was OK.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.941
David and I made up.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.043
Oh, so what, did you
make up part of the way,

20:44.076 --> 20:46.979
or did you make up completely?

20:47.013 --> 20:49.949
Chill, Mom, it was
after Mrs. Healy got home.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.351
Good, at least you
weren't there alone.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.652
Yeah.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.287
Well, I'm gonna go upstairs.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.488
Will you save me some yams?

20:55.522 --> 20:57.123
I'll be right back down.

20:57.156 --> 20:57.957
Yeah.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.934
See, Mom, I told
you there's a God.

21:18.378 --> 21:22.782
CHILD (ON TV): Every time a bell
rings, an angel gets his wings.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.751
MAN (ON TV): That's right.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.954
That's right.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.022
Attaboy, Clarence.
