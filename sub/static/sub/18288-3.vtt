Shaolin Studio,
how can I help you, please?

00:12.000 --> 00:18.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:21.541 --> 00:24.571
You really wanna see this film
going down in flames, don't you?!

00:24.606 --> 00:26.675
What are you talking about?
I love this film.

00:26.710 --> 00:28.916
Oh, bullshit, Tina! Bullshit!

00:28.951 --> 00:31.524
Last week you said
you would burn down the lab

00:31.559 --> 00:33.328
before you let "The Girls"
be released with,

00:33.363 --> 00:36.673
may I say, a brillant ending
tested through the roof,

00:36.708 --> 00:38.514
- and now...
- And now, and now what?

00:38.549 --> 00:39.760
What? What's going on?

00:39.796 --> 00:41.000
Don't stand here and pretend

00:41.000 --> 00:42.713
you don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about!

00:42.750 --> 00:45.049
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Aaron.

00:45.085 --> 00:47.742
I would never do anything
to sabotage this film, okay?

00:47.779 --> 00:50.052
I put my whole life
into this film. Please,

00:50.096 --> 00:51.622
stop yelling at me

00:51.626 --> 00:53.933
and just talk to me.
Tell me what's going on.

00:57.598 --> 00:58.452
Look,

00:59.477 --> 01:01.163
I don't actually think that
you were the one

01:01.208 --> 01:03.510
who stole the negative, Tina
because you are not a complete

01:03.558 --> 01:06.220
and total raving lunatic
like for example

01:06.255 --> 01:08.253
- Jennyfer Schecter!
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

01:08.256 --> 01:09.662
Back up. The negative?

01:10.238 --> 01:11.180
What negative?

01:11.227 --> 01:13.953
The negative was stolen
from the fucking lab, Tina!

01:13.997 --> 01:15.620
We have no more film!

01:15.668 --> 01:17.813
And you think Jenny did this?

01:17.858 --> 01:18.742
I cannot

01:18.746 --> 01:20.781
in my wildest dream imagine

01:20.787 --> 01:22.570
anyone else
on the face of the planet

01:22.597 --> 01:24.362
being that devious or insane.

01:24.396 --> 01:25.572
But Jenny Schecter?

01:25.617 --> 01:26.720
Piece of cake.

01:27.178 --> 01:28.612
And since she's your friend, Tina,

01:28.647 --> 01:30.633
I am holding you
personally responsible for it.

01:30.668 --> 01:32.240
So do whatever you have to do,

01:32.276 --> 01:35.012
but get Schecter to return
that goddamn negative!

01:40.838 --> 01:44.142
Fucking, Jenny.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

03:39.658 --> 03:40.591
Shit!

03:46.355 --> 03:47.750
I don't know what to say.

03:53.036 --> 03:54.762
I'm happy we fucked.

04:07.568 --> 04:08.602
Are you sure?

04:14.255 --> 04:15.021
Yep.

04:55.666 --> 04:57.031
Oh God!

04:57.067 --> 04:58.482
Who the fuck is that?

04:58.526 --> 04:59.371
Who?

05:00.085 --> 05:01.781
Oh God, it's Alice.

05:03.076 --> 05:05.543
- It's Alice!
- What the fuck is Alice doing here?

05:05.576 --> 05:07.452
- It's early.
- She came 'cause

05:07.495 --> 05:10.023
I'm supposed to give her notes
on that fucking treatment.

05:10.057 --> 05:11.251
Tell her to go home.

05:15.558 --> 05:17.471
<b>We have to...
Where is my shirt?</b>

05:17.516 --> 05:20.252
I don't know. I mean,
are you sure it's there?

05:21.388 --> 05:22.110
Here.

05:25.088 --> 05:25.943
Hello?

05:29.897 --> 05:32.073
You know the night
suddenly seems to me like...

05:35.377 --> 05:36.343
Come here.

05:43.955 --> 05:45.740
Do you think
we made a mistake?

05:47.507 --> 05:48.562
No.

05:49.566 --> 05:50.522
Really?

05:53.078 --> 05:54.693
You know
as much as I do.

05:54.735 --> 05:55.701
Come here.

05:59.115 --> 06:00.131
Fuck!

06:01.627 --> 06:03.113
It's so annoying.

06:03.975 --> 06:06.940
- She's in the worse timing.
- Oh my god!

06:16.745 --> 06:19.251
I know that look. Wooo!

06:21.418 --> 06:22.350
What look?

06:22.397 --> 06:23.993
The "I had sex on night" look.

06:23.998 --> 06:24.951
Anyone I know?

06:26.446 --> 06:29.033
No. No, I didn't do anything.

06:29.066 --> 06:30.783
And, just so you know,
I look like this every morning.

06:30.816 --> 06:32.591
Oh my god!
Who are you kidding?

06:32.627 --> 06:34.173
You wear your sex night
on your sleeve.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.303
So when did Jenny
let you back in the house?

06:36.347 --> 06:37.861
Uh... last night.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.311
Hey, little monkey.

06:39.345 --> 06:40.650
Have you seen my earrings?

06:42.107 --> 06:43.952
Monkey?
Well you guys like

06:43.987 --> 06:45.502
super made up.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.071
Are you gonna do
Patrick Demsey's hair

06:51.116 --> 06:52.882
for some kind of commercial
this morning?

06:52.918 --> 06:55.951
- No.
- No? What are you doing then?

06:55.986 --> 06:57.222
- I mean...
- What?

06:57.228 --> 06:59.010
I'm not... who am I doing?
I'm doing

06:59.058 --> 07:01.252
- Who are you doing?
- Eric, Eric Mabius.

07:01.298 --> 07:02.971
Oh right. Do you have to go?

07:03.015 --> 07:04.661
Do you need some help
getting dressed?

07:04.695 --> 07:06.662
- I guess so.
- Yeah?

07:08.956 --> 07:10.110
- What?
- I gotta go.

07:10.115 --> 07:11.900
Okay, I'm gonna help you.

07:11.907 --> 07:13.440
Okay, hang on a sec.

07:16.196 --> 07:17.161
Hang on a sec!

07:22.715 --> 07:23.633
Come here.

07:28.975 --> 07:31.073
Shit, shit, shit!

07:33.467 --> 07:34.673
Oh my god!

07:37.916 --> 07:39.402
Oh my god! Okay.

07:49.296 --> 07:51.281
- Alright.
- Tell me you didn't...

07:51.316 --> 07:53.191
You know
that I have to be at work.

07:53.228 --> 07:54.393
Oh my god!

07:54.428 --> 07:55.601
So we're gonna talk later.

07:58.438 --> 07:59.752
Do you want a cappuccino?

07:59.795 --> 08:01.003
No, thank you.

08:04.056 --> 08:05.131
Are you sure?

08:05.888 --> 08:07.100
I'm gonna

08:07.995 --> 08:09.722
go to your bathroom.

08:13.907 --> 08:14.580
What?

08:20.098 --> 08:21.240
My god!

- "Shut Up And Let Me Go"
by The Ting Tings -

08:36.215 --> 08:37.482
Don't think.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.972
What the fuck?!

09:14.218 --> 09:18.213
The regular clearly estates that
all graduate student

09:18.308 --> 09:20.380
must pick through
graphic design

09:20.415 --> 09:22.781
before they can move on
to individual design.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.210
I'm sorry.

09:28.247 --> 09:29.772
That's alright.

09:30.516 --> 09:31.700
As I was saying...

09:35.495 --> 09:36.883
I'm sorry.

09:42.996 --> 09:45.911
Why is my phone buzzing?

09:45.956 --> 09:47.681
Oh, why is my phone buzzing?

09:47.725 --> 09:49.272
You got a text message.

09:49.316 --> 09:50.353
A what?

09:50.396 --> 09:52.063
A text message...?

09:54.268 --> 09:55.882
- Do you hava a briefing?
- I do.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.263
- I just wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah, of course.

09:59.296 --> 10:00.673
Alice,

10:01.105 --> 10:03.062
I'm gonna be there
in a second, okay?

10:12.675 --> 10:13.772
- Hi!
- Alice,

10:13.816 --> 10:15.462
what the bloody hell
is going on?

10:15.518 --> 10:17.443
Jenny just...
She just took Shane outside.

10:17.475 --> 10:19.100
She said she wanted to talk!

10:19.146 --> 10:21.193
Well, isn't it a bit late
for that?

10:21.786 --> 10:23.822
<i>- Alice, what are they saying?
- I just wanted to tell you...</i>

10:23.917 --> 10:26.141
<i>- What are they talking about?
- You know, I don't have, uh...</i>

10:26.178 --> 10:28.950
I don't have expectations
for our relationship.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.522
Jenny doesn't wanna put any
expectations on their relationship.

10:31.558 --> 10:33.191
And I was thinking
we should probably

10:33.237 --> 10:34.853
set some boundaries, you know?

10:34.857 --> 10:36.462
'Cause we live in the same house.

10:36.496 --> 10:37.670
Jenny wants boundaries.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.702
Boundaries?

10:38.738 --> 10:40.333
Jenny doesn't even know
the meaning of the word.

10:40.376 --> 10:42.281
<i>She never had any boundaries.
Ever.</i>

10:42.286 --> 10:43.730
What I'm trying to say is

10:44.030 --> 10:45.813
I just want it
to be different.

10:46.590 --> 10:48.289
- Yeah, right.
- 'Cause I know you.

10:48.325 --> 10:49.522
I know you do.

10:53.689 --> 10:55.073
They're kissing!

10:59.037 --> 11:01.761
Alice, you're being childish.

11:01.798 --> 11:02.971
<i>They're both grown-up</i>

11:02.987 --> 11:04.501
<i>and if they want to get involved
with one another</i>

11:04.517 --> 11:06.410
<i>- that's totally their prerogative.
- Good kisser.</i>

11:06.455 --> 11:08.072
- Kisser?
- You know that.

11:08.086 --> 11:09.970
Shane just said
Jenny was a good kisser!

11:10.946 --> 11:13.472
My god! It's disgusting!

11:16.577 --> 11:17.792
I have to go.

11:18.638 --> 11:19.642
She's coming.

11:19.677 --> 11:21.453
<i>Alice, what?
Alice what? No!</i>

11:21.497 --> 11:22.903
Yeah, absolutely.

11:22.936 --> 11:25.582
Very good, very juicy tip
for you today.

11:28.656 --> 11:30.193
- I'm just...
<i>- Alice, just say it.</i>

11:30.197 --> 11:31.432
<i>Let me know.
If she's in the room,</i>

11:31.527 --> 11:33.723
<i>- just say yes or no.
- Yes.</i>

11:33.755 --> 11:35.602
Yes, so I will see you

11:35.638 --> 11:36.933
at four.

11:36.976 --> 11:37.911
Okay.

11:38.566 --> 11:39.853
Work, work, work.

11:39.945 --> 11:43.003
- The look is making me come at the...
- Right.

11:43.005 --> 11:45.330
I'd appreciate it
if you don't mention

11:45.378 --> 11:46.482
that stuff.

11:46.525 --> 11:47.230
You know?

11:51.837 --> 11:52.881
It's none of my business.

11:52.925 --> 11:53.791
Nope.

11:58.575 --> 12:00.101
Do you wanna start work?

12:00.988 --> 12:01.821
Yeah, I brought mine.

12:03.538 --> 12:05.612
You know, it's...
It's work.

- "I Can't Explain"
by The Charmless Hearts -

12:06.846 --> 12:08.141
This is just so crazy.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.723
Really? What is Shane thinking?

12:09.766 --> 12:12.083
This is gonna be a
complete and total train rack.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.910
Why it should be
your responsibility?

12:14.958 --> 12:16.461
I think you should just
call Jenny to find out

12:16.477 --> 12:17.722
what the fuck happened
to the negative

12:17.728 --> 12:19.901
because, you know what? I'm sure
it's just some misunderstanding

12:19.946 --> 12:21.261
and he's gonna call you
in a couple of days

12:21.268 --> 12:22.763
and just apologize.

12:22.808 --> 12:23.711
Alright.

12:23.758 --> 12:24.890
Well, call me.

12:28.016 --> 12:29.212
I love you.

12:35.478 --> 12:36.961
What is Tom doing here?

12:36.998 --> 12:38.622
Hello, Bette,
it's good to see you too.

12:41.335 --> 12:42.793
Well, the ADA says
I have the right

12:42.796 --> 12:44.601
to an interpreter
in the workplace.

12:44.895 --> 12:47.161
The Americans With Disabilities
Act?

12:47.208 --> 12:50.271
But you know perfectly well
that I can sign.

12:51.116 --> 12:53.943
Actually your signing has never
really been that great.

12:53.978 --> 12:56.211
So it's probably better
if you just speak.

12:58.558 --> 12:59.610
Fine.

13:02.336 --> 13:05.162
Well, we will both
probably agree that

13:05.205 --> 13:07.493
working together has become

13:07.535 --> 13:08.871
very uncomfortable.

13:11.066 --> 13:14.283
And since I am
the head of this department

13:14.316 --> 13:16.683
and I have
to have it run smoothly,

13:17.836 --> 13:20.111
I think it would
be best for you to resign.

13:25.457 --> 13:26.340
No.

13:26.818 --> 13:28.442
Excuse me?

13:29.585 --> 13:31.812
I love my job.
Why would I resign?

13:32.378 --> 13:35.350
A few weeks ago,
you volunteered to resign from CU.

13:38.447 --> 13:41.071
Right. I offered to resign
to protect your ass.

13:41.728 --> 13:44.182
Which is something I would do
for somebody that I'm in love with.

13:44.236 --> 13:46.301
Obviously
I'm no longer in love with you.

13:49.097 --> 13:50.770
If you don't resign,

13:52.136 --> 13:54.051
then I'm gonna have
to fire you.

13:58.508 --> 13:59.752
Go right ahead.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.233
- Yeah?
- We're in a meeting here, so...

14:15.877 --> 14:17.090
Yeah, just...

14:17.125 --> 14:18.631
Okay, here is my...

14:18.666 --> 14:20.342
- I turn the ring off.
- Thanks.

14:21.118 --> 14:22.411
Getting a lot of phone calls.

14:23.017 --> 14:25.012
- I don't know why.
- Will you pass me that?

14:25.056 --> 14:26.422
- Sure.
- Thanks.

14:27.228 --> 14:30.213
Thank you. How long
did it take you to write this?

14:31.225 --> 14:32.682
Oh, I just wrote that in a night.

14:32.737 --> 14:34.770
I just kind of
stream-of-consciousness

14:34.848 --> 14:36.582
- spit it out.
- One night?

14:36.618 --> 14:38.141
This took you one night?

14:38.148 --> 14:40.800
You people think that
you can just come into Hollywood

14:40.847 --> 14:42.841
and suddenly
you're gonna make it

14:42.875 --> 14:44.612
and you're just gonna like
write everything

14:44.645 --> 14:46.213
and it's gonna be great
in one night.

14:46.246 --> 14:47.231
You know what?

14:48.587 --> 14:51.251
My work to write a screenplay

14:51.287 --> 14:52.701
is a craft.

14:52.736 --> 14:53.790
Okay?

14:53.837 --> 14:56.120
And if you're gonna sit here
across from me,

14:56.167 --> 14:58.480
you have to start
taking it seriously.

14:58.515 --> 15:00.310
So this is what
we are gonna do.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.881
Pitch it to me. Go.

15:02.417 --> 15:04.542
I'm an executive, okay?

15:06.048 --> 15:07.091
Like a pitch meeting?

15:07.095 --> 15:08.631
- Sell it.
- I need to work on this.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.313
- Go for it.
- It's a good idea.

15:12.595 --> 15:17.443
It's about a talk show host
who is really fantastic and

15:17.995 --> 15:20.791
is dating a cop,
who's dark and broody and

15:20.826 --> 15:22.852
they get caught up in this,
this murder mystery.

15:22.857 --> 15:25.903
So there'll be like car chases,
and it's got action and excitement.

15:25.937 --> 15:27.751
It's kinda like foul play.

15:27.788 --> 15:29.180
It meets "Mr. and Mrs. Smith",

15:29.227 --> 15:30.913
so it's got the romantic,

15:31.288 --> 15:32.750
you know, actionny...

15:32.795 --> 15:35.450
- It's kinda got everything!
- Except a good idea.

15:36.486 --> 15:38.470
Just saying. I mean...

15:38.505 --> 15:40.973
I don't think
that's gonna sell.

15:40.978 --> 15:42.350
Pretty boring.

15:42.826 --> 15:44.102
But you know,

15:44.136 --> 15:45.750
the heart

15:45.787 --> 15:49.243
of this is that
it's just not realistic.

15:49.278 --> 15:52.560
These two people would never be
in a relationship together.

15:52.597 --> 15:55.132
- No, Alice.
- I kinda...

15:55.175 --> 15:57.720
- Yeah?
- Well, Alice, you know what I think?

15:57.768 --> 15:59.591
The future's now.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.251
Right now

16:01.296 --> 16:03.190
and this is not
the way forward.

16:03.235 --> 16:06.312
Because when I'm with you
in a group of people

16:06.347 --> 16:09.000
and I close my eyes
and I'm like ooooooo

16:09.876 --> 16:11.332
that girl...

16:13.067 --> 16:14.021
the voice.

16:15.396 --> 16:18.482
She should be doing
cartoon voiceovers.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.753
I have never really

16:24.788 --> 16:26.860
thought of cartoons as a

16:26.895 --> 16:28.000
career move.

16:28.036 --> 16:29.472
You have

16:29.505 --> 16:32.151
a unique fork laryngeal.
It's right here.

16:34.557 --> 16:36.923
Jenny, open up!
I need to talk to you.

16:43.346 --> 16:46.320
Thank you so much
for the inspiration.

16:46.366 --> 16:47.470
Thank you.

16:47.865 --> 16:49.621
- Alright.
- Great to see you.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.723
- I'm gonna work on this.
- Okay.

16:53.908 --> 16:55.230
Don't tell anybody
I told you

16:55.318 --> 16:56.682
'cause I promised
I won't say anything!

16:58.798 --> 17:01.301
Wait. Are you sure
about Jenny and Shane?

17:01.308 --> 17:03.090
I saw them make out.
With tongue.

17:03.638 --> 17:04.771
- Gross!
- I know.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.210
I'm already have initiated down
but the image is burnt in my head.

17:07.248 --> 17:08.970
Hey, Jenny,
thanks again for your help.

17:09.005 --> 17:09.881
No problem.

17:09.885 --> 17:11.470
I take it the meeting
didn't go so well?

17:11.476 --> 17:12.410
Yeah, not so good.

17:12.417 --> 17:14.592
Well, I wanna hear all about it,
but first right now

17:14.596 --> 17:16.000
I have
to go fucking kill Jenny.

17:16.018 --> 17:17.272
Why?
What did she do to you?

17:17.318 --> 17:18.242
I can't talk about it right now.

17:18.286 --> 17:20.313
I'll tell you all about it later,
alright? I just...

17:21.507 --> 17:22.371
I have to calm down, okay.

17:22.415 --> 17:24.089
I just have to go
talk some senses to her.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.491
Yeah, good luck with that.

17:26.026 --> 17:26.872
I'll call you.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.902
I got a new cappuccino maker.
Do you want one?

17:33.946 --> 17:36.253
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

17:36.285 --> 17:37.812
Jenny, I need to talk to you.

17:37.845 --> 17:39.213
I can make it with soil.

17:40.365 --> 17:42.773
- Do you... Okay. Soil, fine.
- Soil? Okay.

17:42.817 --> 17:43.720
Great.

17:44.148 --> 17:45.270
What's up?

17:45.315 --> 17:49.960
The negative of "Lez Girls"?
It was stolen from the lab.

17:50.005 --> 17:51.012
What?

17:51.045 --> 17:52.792
- The negative was stolen.
- I can't hear you.

17:52.825 --> 17:54.690
The negative was stolen
from the lab!

17:54.787 --> 17:56.233
Why are you keeping
saying the word "negative"?

17:56.267 --> 17:57.230
Are you not hearing me?

17:57.245 --> 17:58.801
- The negative...
- Smell the beans.

17:58.847 --> 18:02.010
...to our movie was stolen
from the lab.

18:02.046 --> 18:03.750
Who cares
if the negative was stolen?

18:03.756 --> 18:05.840
The editor has it
on her computer.

18:06.326 --> 18:09.422
We shot the movie on film,
okay?

18:09.458 --> 18:10.571
Alright?

18:10.605 --> 18:12.712
The kind of film you might
take pictures with.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.073
- Alright?
- Okay.

18:15.118 --> 18:17.691
The negative
is the original image, alright?

18:17.738 --> 18:20.660
Without that, you can't
make prints. Without prints,

18:20.695 --> 18:22.853
you can't screen it
in a movie theater, alright?

18:22.875 --> 18:25.810
It doesn't matter what the editor
has on her computer, alright?

18:25.858 --> 18:28.230
Because it cannot
be projected on to a screen.

18:29.056 --> 18:30.822
No one's gonna see our movie.

18:30.855 --> 18:33.370
Are you saying that
nobody's gonna see the movie?

18:35.106 --> 18:37.141
Oh my god, Tina!

18:39.136 --> 18:41.203
This film is my whole life!

18:41.725 --> 18:43.242
I know it's your life.

18:43.275 --> 18:45.100
That's why I'm here.

18:45.138 --> 18:46.891
I just... I came over

18:46.936 --> 18:48.172
to talk to you

18:48.205 --> 18:50.200
face to face.

18:50.237 --> 18:51.990
Look, I talked to the lab,

18:52.605 --> 18:54.270
they kinda put a trace on it,

18:54.306 --> 18:56.590
they're gonna find it,
but I just thought

18:56.595 --> 18:58.181
you could talk to me,

18:58.226 --> 19:00.722
- just one on one.
- About what?

19:02.276 --> 19:04.542
- Is it here?
- Is it here?!

19:04.585 --> 19:05.953
You... If I stole it?

19:06.326 --> 19:08.672
You wanna know
if I stole the movie?

19:08.717 --> 19:10.980
Jenny, it's possible.
Look, if it's here,

19:11.018 --> 19:13.522
just grab it. We'll take it back
to the lab, okay?

19:13.556 --> 19:15.890
And I can promise, nothing bad
is gonna happen to you.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.591
But shit
has already happen to me!

19:17.596 --> 19:19.131
My film's already been stolen!

19:19.177 --> 19:20.510
Why don't you ask Adele?

19:20.545 --> 19:22.252
Adele doesn't have any reason
to steal the negative!

19:22.297 --> 19:24.270
Oh, Adele has no reason
to steal? Why?

19:24.295 --> 19:25.692
Her whole career would be
on line.

19:25.735 --> 19:27.221
Her fucking career
is on the line.

19:27.257 --> 19:29.151
That twerp
has a three-picture deal!

19:29.188 --> 19:32.042
I have nothing!
Nothing, Tina! Okay?

19:32.076 --> 19:34.131
I don't even have
an agent anymore. Because

19:34.178 --> 19:37.060
my agents fired me because
they don't think I'm professional.

19:37.108 --> 19:39.601
And then and then,
if this film doesn't come out

19:39.638 --> 19:41.693
then I'm totally fucked, okay?

19:41.727 --> 19:43.591
So I need this film to come out

19:43.706 --> 19:45.970
so I have this kind of chance

19:46.008 --> 19:49.183
of getting a job again.
So you need to find that movie!

19:52.075 --> 19:54.473
I did not steal the negative.

19:57.758 --> 19:59.052
I'm sorry.

20:01.016 --> 20:02.503
They're holding me responsible.

20:02.538 --> 20:05.261
Aaron is personally
holding me responsible.

20:06.047 --> 20:08.831
Jenny, I'm sorry, okay?
I believe you.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.543
- Oh my god! This is so bad.
- I promise you.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.753
So you guys are a couple?

20:14.647 --> 20:17.040
No. No, Alice,
we're not a couple.

20:18.048 --> 20:20.953
Things got emotional and
it happened one time. That's...

20:20.986 --> 20:22.812
It's not, not a big deal.

20:22.856 --> 20:24.840
Shane, it's Jenny!
I mean,

20:24.906 --> 20:26.833
I just wanna make sure you know
who you're talking about here.

20:26.866 --> 20:29.221
I'm surely aware
of who it is, thank you, but

20:29.938 --> 20:31.061
listen,

20:31.107 --> 20:32.721
we got each other.

20:33.047 --> 20:35.760
We do! And I have to believe
she's not gonna get weird!

20:35.796 --> 20:38.441
She even said it today.
You know, we live under the same...

20:38.488 --> 20:40.311
Under the same roof,
you will have to set boundaries.

20:40.348 --> 20:41.461
I know.

20:42.478 --> 20:44.952
- How did you know that?
- I just, you're expecting Jenny

20:44.996 --> 20:46.913
to set boundaries.
It's like...

20:46.916 --> 20:48.511
- What?
- I have to.

20:48.547 --> 20:49.840
I don't have another choice.

20:49.938 --> 20:52.740
Even the most
level-headed calm person

20:52.785 --> 20:54.451
would be freaking out

20:54.506 --> 20:56.083
- if they slept with their roomate.
- Listen to me.

20:56.115 --> 20:58.483
- It's normal.
- It happened one time.

20:59.087 --> 21:01.063
And just because
it happened doesn't mean like

21:01.098 --> 21:02.083
we're gonna add water

21:02.115 --> 21:04.670
and become instant relationship
all of a sudden.

21:04.767 --> 21:05.943
- "Too Beautiful To Be Good"
by Franciene Thomas -

21:06.366 --> 21:07.443
What?

21:07.476 --> 21:08.851
Nothing. She asked

21:08.897 --> 21:10.573
get some beer on the way home.

21:13.516 --> 21:14.521
And,

21:14.527 --> 21:16.130
listen, between you and me,

21:17.075 --> 21:18.471
if it was to happen again?

21:20.607 --> 21:22.561
What?
What is that face?

21:23.655 --> 21:24.822
I wouldn't,

21:25.428 --> 21:26.671
I wouldn't mind.

21:30.678 --> 21:31.773
It was good.

21:32.496 --> 21:34.020
How good was it?

21:38.558 --> 21:40.223
Better than I expected good.

21:42.737 --> 21:44.541
You're gonna sleep with her
again tonight.

21:44.556 --> 21:46.050
I will not. I swear.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.082
No. I mean, I can't swear, but,

21:48.985 --> 21:50.362
I'm not planning on it.

21:50.986 --> 21:52.631
At the end of the day,
I really

21:53.536 --> 21:56.410
am happy that
she's back in my life.

21:56.925 --> 21:58.432
Speaking of which,
I've gotta get going.

22:02.586 --> 22:04.052
I've got to find
a liquor store.

22:10.758 --> 22:12.502
Phyllis, I need to talk to you
about Jodi.

22:12.595 --> 22:15.302
She is implacable.
I have never met anybody so...

22:18.396 --> 22:20.041
Bette, come sit down.

22:20.228 --> 22:22.373
<b>I feel like we us,</b>

22:22.417 --> 22:25.890
to discuss this problem
with all the parties involved.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.332
Jodi has given me
her side of the story.

22:28.378 --> 22:31.020
So if there's anything
you think I should know,

22:31.056 --> 22:32.220
now is the time.

22:36.065 --> 22:38.572
Jodi agreed to resign
several weeks ago,

22:38.607 --> 22:39.893
and

22:39.925 --> 22:43.611
I simply asked her
to submit that resignation.

22:43.646 --> 22:45.963
The Justin Donovan
gun-to-the-head incident

22:45.966 --> 22:48.232
has completely evaporated.

22:48.277 --> 22:51.633
So there's no longer any reason
for Jodi to resign.

22:51.675 --> 22:54.501
The Justin Donovan controversy
is only educative

22:54.545 --> 22:56.013
of a larger problem.

22:56.046 --> 22:58.242
Jodi isn't interested in any authority
other than her own

22:58.288 --> 23:00.692
and as my subordinate,
she has repeatedly demonstrated

23:00.736 --> 23:02.593
that she is determined
to make it as

23:02.628 --> 23:04.963
uncomfortable as possible for me
to do my job.

23:04.985 --> 23:07.123
So, you threaten
to fire your ex-girlfriend

23:07.166 --> 23:09.053
because having her around
makes you uncomfortable?

23:09.097 --> 23:12.371
No, that's not what I said.
It's a question of authority, Phyllis.

23:12.436 --> 23:14.092
I'm really shocked, Bette.

23:14.127 --> 23:16.651
I would never have imagined
that you of all people

23:16.695 --> 23:18.040
would allow this...

23:18.087 --> 23:20.763
this dyke drama to interfere
with you doing your job.

23:20.808 --> 23:23.611
- This is not dyke drama, Phyllis!
- When you entered

23:23.657 --> 23:25.963
into a sexual relationship
with a subordinate,

23:25.998 --> 23:28.163
as you referred to her,

23:28.198 --> 23:31.272
you relinquished
your right to fire her.

23:31.307 --> 23:34.520
Because that's what's called
sexual harassment.

23:38.705 --> 23:41.152
Are you threatening to sue me
for sexual harassment?!

23:43.545 --> 23:44.990
That thought
never occurred to me.

23:45.037 --> 23:46.933
I'm not really interested
in lawsuits.

23:49.026 --> 23:50.991
This is not coming from Jodi,
Bette.

23:51.025 --> 23:52.330
It's coming from me.

23:52.365 --> 23:54.631
The last thing
this university needs

23:54.677 --> 23:57.813
is a sexual harassment law suit
between two lesbians.

23:57.908 --> 23:59.331
She just said
she's not going to sue me.

23:59.427 --> 24:00.860
I don't care what Jodi says.

24:00.906 --> 24:02.662
I cannot allow you

24:02.695 --> 24:05.353
to expose this university
to this kind of threat.

24:06.006 --> 24:07.581
Have I made myself clear?

24:27.446 --> 24:28.460
Guess what?

24:29.007 --> 24:30.952
I finished my whole treatment.

24:33.048 --> 24:34.602
I'm excited!

24:35.276 --> 24:37.273
- You did?
- I did.

24:37.657 --> 24:39.072
And guess what else.

24:39.458 --> 24:42.142
- What?
- I was thinking about you.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.492
You were.

24:44.317 --> 24:47.063
I was. Everything
that we did last night.

24:47.098 --> 24:48.911
And what were you thinking?

24:49.757 --> 24:51.770
I was thinking that I liked it.

24:54.295 --> 24:55.210
What?

24:56.826 --> 24:57.922
What are you doing?

24:57.957 --> 24:59.352
Come here.

24:59.385 --> 25:00.452
Are you sure?

25:29.517 --> 25:31.041
Take this off.

25:31.678 --> 25:33.551
I am glad we made up.

25:56.047 --> 25:58.222
And we're back on "The Look"

25:58.268 --> 26:00.583
and you've all been
waiting patiently

26:00.618 --> 26:02.560
to hear what secrets

26:02.598 --> 26:04.682
Alice Pieszecki has
to share with us today.

26:04.726 --> 26:06.973
Thank you for that
great entrance, Andrea, but,

26:07.055 --> 26:09.332
secrets makes it sound
a little dirty.

26:09.376 --> 26:12.242
Well, dirty, Alice,
isn't the eye of the beholder?

26:12.798 --> 26:14.832
That may be my point, Mary.

26:15.385 --> 26:17.323
I know a lot of you
think of me

26:17.426 --> 26:20.681
as the keeper of these
dirty little gay secrets, but,

26:21.528 --> 26:24.862
I received a letter last week,
and it made me think

26:24.896 --> 26:27.602
a lot about things I've done.
So I thought

26:27.985 --> 26:30.062
Today, I will share something

26:30.106 --> 26:31.843
a little intimate with you.

26:32.508 --> 26:33.301
Great!

26:39.316 --> 26:40.913
"Dear Miss Pieszecki,"

26:40.956 --> 26:42.883
they spelled it right
there, which

26:42.928 --> 26:44.271
I appreciate.

26:46.496 --> 26:48.990
"I'm writing to you because
you might be able to help"

26:49.037 --> 26:51.272
"people understand
what I'm going through".

26:52.056 --> 26:53.400
"For the last three weeks,"

26:53.405 --> 26:56.473
"my brother weight has been
on life support"

26:57.128 --> 27:00.230
"I've been to the hospital
every day, praying for a miracle"

27:01.078 --> 27:02.472
"but this morning,"

27:02.515 --> 27:04.861
"I watched them
lower my big brother's coffin"

27:04.898 --> 27:06.271
"into the ground"

27:08.615 --> 27:11.120
I don't understand
who is this.

27:11.158 --> 27:14.492
"My brother's dead because
he wrote a love letter"

27:14.525 --> 27:16.490
"to a guy named Marcus"

27:17.425 --> 27:20.440
"And Marcus shot him in the face"

27:22.995 --> 27:25.541
"I'm writing to ask you
to please tell your viewers"

27:25.586 --> 27:28.251
"that it's not OK
to hurt gay people"

27:28.836 --> 27:30.823
"We didn't do anything to them"

27:31.035 --> 27:33.652
"So why can't they just
leave us alone"

27:38.497 --> 27:40.541
I know I've been...

27:42.667 --> 27:45.511
I know I've justified
outing in the past,

27:45.545 --> 27:47.641
saying it's a political act.

27:48.256 --> 27:50.862
I certainly do believe that

27:50.898 --> 27:52.891
the world would be better if

27:54.005 --> 27:58.122
people felt free and safe enough
to be who they really are,

27:59.067 --> 28:00.802
but what I forgot

28:02.036 --> 28:05.562
was some people choose to stay
in the closet for other reasons.

28:07.155 --> 28:11.050
One of those reasons is
homophobia is alive and well,

28:11.098 --> 28:13.373
and oftentimes in this country,

28:14.515 --> 28:15.832
it can be deadly.

28:22.006 --> 28:22.842
So...

28:23.588 --> 28:25.201
So I wanted to share that.

28:25.847 --> 28:26.901
Thank you.

28:27.516 --> 28:31.060
Thank you very much, Alice
for bringing that to our attention.

28:31.106 --> 28:32.062
You're welcome.

28:32.107 --> 28:34.023
Well, right now
we're gonna go to a commercial

28:34.057 --> 28:36.120
and when we come back
we are gonna to discuss

28:36.186 --> 28:37.712
how to dress for spring.

28:38.096 --> 28:38.980
Don't go away.

28:47.566 --> 28:48.980
Shaolin, may I help you?

28:55.277 --> 28:56.172
Well, that's what I thought

28:56.217 --> 28:57.650
'cause it occured to me that...

29:11.137 --> 29:12.671
What's going on?

29:12.715 --> 29:14.740
Aaron wants
to see you right away.

29:14.786 --> 29:15.952
Again?

29:16.565 --> 29:18.543
Oh for fax sake!

29:24.485 --> 29:25.651
You wanted to see me?

29:28.477 --> 29:30.782
"Dear Deluxe Motion Picture Lab,"

29:30.825 --> 29:34.892
"please release the Lez Girls negative
to the East Side Messenger Service,"

29:34.937 --> 29:36.973
"who will arrive
at 8 P.M. tonight"

29:37.016 --> 29:38.362
"Sincerely"

29:40.977 --> 29:43.261
You wanna read that signature
for me?

29:43.916 --> 29:47.172
Oh, my God. You don't
actually believe that I did this.

29:47.218 --> 29:49.881
Is that or is that not
your signature, Tina?

29:49.928 --> 29:52.103
Yes.
But I didn't write this letter!

29:52.137 --> 29:53.763
Then you'd better find out
who did.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.033
Fuck!

30:03.818 --> 30:06.253
It's painful for me
as this is.

30:07.017 --> 30:09.030
So you want me to resign?

30:09.077 --> 30:10.063
Yes.

30:10.097 --> 30:12.632
Look, I know I'm not
the only administrator at CU

30:12.718 --> 30:15.173
who's ever had a relationship
with another faculty member.

30:15.205 --> 30:17.432
No, but you're the
only lesbian administrator

30:17.505 --> 30:19.011
who's had
a nasty public breakup

30:19.058 --> 30:20.123
with a faculty member.

30:20.168 --> 30:21.753
So this is because I'm a lesbian.

30:21.797 --> 30:23.070
- "Local Girls"
by Graham Parker -

30:23.116 --> 30:25.383
Or is it because
you're a lesbian, Phyllis?

30:25.385 --> 30:28.051
Before you go any further,
yes. It's true.

30:28.098 --> 30:30.680
This situation could reflect
badly on me, but...

30:30.728 --> 30:31.881
- Phyllis, she said she had no...
- But it's not the only reason.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.703
- ... intention...
- Let me finish!

30:33.747 --> 30:36.933
Unfortunately, Bette,
this is not your first offense.

30:38.595 --> 30:40.391
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:40.437 --> 30:43.131
Nadia's complaint sided
Gordon Percy,

30:43.166 --> 30:44.832
but she also referred to

30:44.878 --> 30:46.620
her encounter with you.

30:49.017 --> 30:51.122
Nadia filled a complaint
against me?

30:51.148 --> 30:51.852
Yes.

30:55.775 --> 30:57.683
So why didn't you tell me
about it?

30:57.715 --> 30:58.971
Because I knew
you'd be angry

30:59.017 --> 31:00.792
and you'd wanna fight it
and it was more convenient

31:00.845 --> 31:02.082
to make it go away.

31:03.637 --> 31:05.083
So you see,

31:05.107 --> 31:07.700
I've already given you
a second chance.

31:14.877 --> 31:17.151
Phyllis, Tina and I
are about to adopt a baby.

31:17.198 --> 31:18.652
We just started

31:18.687 --> 31:20.432
construction
on the second storey.

31:20.475 --> 31:22.890
- This is really not the...
- Don't grovel, Bette. It's beneath you.

31:22.926 --> 31:25.733
You know with your talent
you'll find a position in no time.

31:26.258 --> 31:27.590
May I get these ladies refill?

31:27.638 --> 31:29.641
I'll have one. Bette?

31:32.077 --> 31:34.201
I'll have a red Manhattan,
please.

31:47.577 --> 31:50.712
You were a beautiful role model
for me when I was coming out.

31:51.557 --> 31:52.970
Jodi too, but,

31:53.007 --> 31:55.473
you in a very special way

31:55.516 --> 31:57.601
and I will always be grateful.

31:57.646 --> 31:58.603
That's nice.

31:59.048 --> 32:00.601
And I don't blame you.

32:01.157 --> 32:03.323
If svelte young coït
with long blond hair

32:03.345 --> 32:05.783
was throwing herself at me,
God knows what I'd do.

32:05.806 --> 32:07.470
She was a grade student.

32:07.516 --> 32:09.690
To tell you the truth,
I've had my own struggle

32:09.726 --> 32:11.700
with attractions to subordinates.

32:12.535 --> 32:15.001
I've one crush
that's been incredibly

32:15.037 --> 32:16.380
difficult

32:17.157 --> 32:18.843
not to act on them.

32:23.058 --> 32:24.470
You wanna know who it is?

32:26.998 --> 32:28.220
I'd rather not.

32:29.277 --> 32:31.151
Oh come on! Guess!

32:31.185 --> 32:32.642
It's someone you know.

32:32.678 --> 32:34.282
- "Soul Shoes" by Graham Parker -

32:35.437 --> 32:37.350
Phyllis, I really...
I have no idea.

32:37.385 --> 32:39.390
You know? And I thought you and
Joyce were gonna get married.

32:39.396 --> 32:40.840
Joyce? Yes.

32:40.887 --> 32:42.482
But as
Jimmy Carter once said,

32:42.516 --> 32:45.341
"I've strayed in my mind's eye
many times".

32:46.077 --> 32:48.641
Especially
with this particular person.

32:49.517 --> 32:52.041
But now that
you're no longer my employee,

32:53.085 --> 32:55.040
I feel free
to make my confession.

32:58.106 --> 33:01.461
I've always found you wildly,

33:02.216 --> 33:04.332
exquisitely attractive.

33:15.377 --> 33:17.571
- Yes.
- Phyllis, no.

33:20.037 --> 33:23.031
From the moment I saw you,
tall, strong,

33:23.076 --> 33:24.082
brilliant.

33:24.095 --> 33:25.811
- Don't.
- Erudite.

33:25.855 --> 33:27.143
Incredibly... It was

33:27.177 --> 33:28.653
so difficult for me
not to act on it.

33:28.696 --> 33:29.763
You can't imagine.

33:30.296 --> 33:32.291
- Joyce.
- Joyce is wonderful, yeah.

33:32.327 --> 33:34.213
Oh, yes, she's TCB,
she's good in bed, but

33:34.245 --> 33:35.380
makes a good living,

33:35.425 --> 33:37.043
tight with Mayor Newsom, but...

33:37.125 --> 33:38.602
if you gave me

33:38.646 --> 33:41.321
the smallest amount
of encouragement,

33:41.368 --> 33:43.341
I would lose her in a second.

33:47.148 --> 33:48.580
You just fired me.

33:49.015 --> 33:50.842
I know.
But it may be the best thing

33:50.875 --> 33:53.493
that ever happened
to both of us.

33:56.888 --> 33:59.673
You are and will always be

34:00.565 --> 34:03.190
the woman of my dreams.

34:07.798 --> 34:10.251
You'll have my letter
of resignation in the morning.

34:14.947 --> 34:16.530
- "It's Out Of My Hands"
by Soul Children -

34:18.277 --> 34:20.452
Girl, look what you got!

34:23.027 --> 34:25.291
Next time Dylan Moreland
sends me flowers,

34:25.335 --> 34:26.621
Kit, please, just

34:26.657 --> 34:27.850
don't accept them.

34:29.016 --> 34:30.880
OK, I'll throw 'em out.

34:32.525 --> 34:34.471
No, that'd be a waste. Let's

34:35.215 --> 34:37.003
put them in a bathroom, or...

34:40.574 --> 34:41.750
Maybe we...

34:42.146 --> 34:43.870
maybe recycle them.

35:02.565 --> 35:04.902
"You're beautiful
when you're angry"

35:14.278 --> 35:16.793
I guess hate crimes are not

35:16.828 --> 35:19.043
"fun gay",
they're depressing gay.

35:19.087 --> 35:21.132
And now I'm going
to this fucking 7:00 meeting

35:21.208 --> 35:23.052
where I'm gonna get fired.
And

35:23.088 --> 35:25.030
I'm scared to go.
I'm gonna say people I am sorry.

35:25.075 --> 35:26.442
Okay? For what I did.

35:26.487 --> 35:28.213
And I'm gonna beg
for this job back.

35:28.258 --> 35:29.830
I can't let this happen.

35:30.088 --> 35:32.361
Oh God, I don't know.
What about...

35:33.866 --> 35:35.620
This would be good, right?

35:37.307 --> 35:38.752
- No.
- Why?

35:38.785 --> 35:39.862
I don't like it.

35:40.387 --> 35:42.270
It's too something.
I don't know.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.413
But wait, but you're not sorry.

35:44.467 --> 35:46.510
I will be sorry
if I lose this job.

35:46.556 --> 35:47.751
I do not like being broke.

35:47.788 --> 35:51.030
But Alice, you don't always get
rewarded for doing the right thing.

35:51.406 --> 35:53.862
I mean, some people
get punished. I got punished.

35:53.908 --> 35:56.233
Are you really gonna make this
about you right now?

35:56.268 --> 35:57.333
Are you really gonna do that,

35:57.366 --> 35:59.400
make it about the fuckin' army
right now?

36:00.286 --> 36:01.631
I am not here.

36:02.388 --> 36:03.701
This is so fucked.

36:03.746 --> 36:05.342
- I don't have any fucking clothes!
- Hello?

36:06.075 --> 36:10.070
Alice, it's some woman from
the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center.

36:10.106 --> 36:11.503
Tell her I donated last year.

36:11.538 --> 36:13.802
I don't have time for this.
Keep help me!

36:13.838 --> 36:16.033
Hold on.
Hi, she's not here.

36:16.087 --> 36:17.212
Can I take a message?

36:25.156 --> 36:27.962
Alice Pieszecki...
Oh my god! Thank you.

36:27.995 --> 36:30.512
Thank you. You have no idea
how much this means.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.233
Wouah,
it's overwhelmed welcome.

36:32.268 --> 36:33.440
This is Tasha.

36:33.478 --> 36:36.163
I'm sorry. I'm just,
I'm really happy to see Alice.

36:36.197 --> 36:37.921
Yeah, no problem,
yeah, we're here now.

36:38.015 --> 36:39.810
Okay, great. It's this way.

36:46.258 --> 36:47.400
She's this way.

36:49.578 --> 36:51.241
Marie doesn't believe me.

36:51.287 --> 36:53.002
She was already out there
when you read her letter today,

36:53.038 --> 36:55.721
and she thinks I'm just making it up
to get her to come in.

36:55.766 --> 36:57.781
I think if she just sees you

36:57.828 --> 37:00.680
- and she knows you're here...
- Alright. Jamie? Jamie, hi.

37:00.726 --> 37:02.750
Yeah, this is weird and crazy.

37:02.796 --> 37:04.881
I can't talk a teenager
off the ledge.

37:06.008 --> 37:07.830
What if she jumps
while I'm talking to her?

37:07.918 --> 37:09.290
What if she jumps
and you're not?

37:09.315 --> 37:10.991
But Alice
isn't qualified for this.

37:11.026 --> 37:13.262
- She's not a psychologist.
- I'm not.

37:13.305 --> 37:16.051
- This is... I don't even know the girl.
- She knows you.

37:16.086 --> 37:17.412
You're her hero.

37:17.447 --> 37:19.693
She's so excited everytime
she sees you on "The Look"

37:19.725 --> 37:20.800
because
she says it gives her hope

37:20.808 --> 37:22.183
that someone could be out
like you

37:22.225 --> 37:24.172
and still be successful.
Come on, would you...

37:24.206 --> 37:26.173
Please,
can you juste talk to her?

37:26.215 --> 37:27.541
This isn't gonna work.

37:27.577 --> 37:30.121
Alice can't handle
a situation like this.

37:30.166 --> 37:32.800
This is a crisis. You should call,
you should call the police.

37:32.848 --> 37:34.781
Marie's terrified of the police.

37:34.828 --> 37:37.383
<b>What about her parents?
They already lost a child.</b>

37:37.417 --> 37:38.800
and they did shit the hell
out of her.

37:38.837 --> 37:40.303
But it's not her responsibility.

37:40.347 --> 37:43.582
Yes, I know, but...
Come on, Marie loves her.

37:47.957 --> 37:49.730
Why don't you come up there
so we can talk?

37:49.746 --> 37:51.851
Yeah, right.
Like I'm gonna fall for that?!

37:51.897 --> 37:53.672
I'm not going anywhere.

37:54.076 --> 37:56.001
You wanna talk,
you can come down here.

37:58.547 --> 37:59.962
Alice, what are you doing?

38:00.006 --> 38:01.523
What? The kid's not coming up.

38:02.645 --> 38:05.051
Yeah, but you shouldn't
go down there. You should...

38:05.095 --> 38:07.602
What? So I'm not qualified,
I'm not gonna make crisis?

38:29.848 --> 38:32.030
Look, I came to the ledge.

38:37.557 --> 38:38.992
So what? Is it like

38:39.026 --> 38:42.021
part of your show or something?
Did you bring your camera crew?

38:42.857 --> 38:44.033
Is that what you want?

38:44.066 --> 38:45.651
Do you wanna be on TV?

38:45.695 --> 38:47.122
Fuck you!

38:50.128 --> 38:52.470
No, I don't have
a camera crew with me.

39:02.067 --> 39:03.823
I'm gonna be fired.

39:07.485 --> 39:08.313
Why?

39:12.765 --> 39:14.820
They didn't really like
that I read your,

39:14.856 --> 39:16.382
your letter on the air.

39:18.656 --> 39:21.843
The producers in my show,
they got, they got really pissed.

39:24.506 --> 39:25.840
I'm sorry.

39:30.316 --> 39:32.111
I'm not. You know?

39:34.655 --> 39:36.323
You know what? I mean,

39:36.355 --> 39:39.172
millions, millions of people

39:40.516 --> 39:44.202
heard the truth today.
They heard what you had to say.

39:46.057 --> 39:48.161
They did. I mean,
you changed the world a little bit

39:48.207 --> 39:49.701
when you wrote me that letter.

39:50.485 --> 39:52.141
You really did.

39:52.508 --> 39:53.503
And

39:56.078 --> 39:59.631
if you stick around, you could
help change it a lot more.

40:02.278 --> 40:04.263
Is that
what you're tryin to do?

40:04.296 --> 40:06.102
Trying to change the world?

40:10.585 --> 40:13.171
I don't know. Maybe I am
in my own little way.

40:33.935 --> 40:35.991
That's so funny!

40:38.375 --> 40:40.210
You guys, over here!

40:41.806 --> 40:43.890
I bet all boys loved you.

40:45.678 --> 40:48.110
Yes, they did,

40:48.156 --> 40:49.673
girlfriend.

40:51.307 --> 40:53.151
Yeah, I had my share,

40:53.186 --> 40:54.933
back in the day.

40:54.978 --> 40:56.672
But men...

40:56.716 --> 40:58.542
they just mess me up.

40:58.578 --> 40:59.900
What about women?

40:59.937 --> 41:01.323
Oh, women?

41:01.675 --> 41:03.460
Oh, puh-leeze,

41:03.485 --> 41:05.560
they can mess each other up too.

41:05.596 --> 41:06.880
I can't begin to tell you

41:06.918 --> 41:09.371
how much drama I see.

41:11.206 --> 41:13.033
Oh, but you're happy now.

41:13.077 --> 41:14.590
Happy with Helena?

41:17.428 --> 41:20.523
Yeah, I'm happy
with my partner. Yeah.

41:21.638 --> 41:24.041
This place is a bomb,

41:24.085 --> 41:26.560
and you and your girl
are gonna tear it up tonight.

41:26.607 --> 41:28.050
And Sunset

41:28.097 --> 41:30.502
is gonna rock Kit's ball.

41:30.537 --> 41:32.193
Oh, yes, you are.

41:32.935 --> 41:34.761
No one's gonna fix my face

41:34.805 --> 41:36.553
'cause Miss Porter
is in the house.

41:36.586 --> 41:38.643
I've got some
serious competition.

41:38.676 --> 41:40.531
Oh, you go on now.

41:40.575 --> 41:42.653
Those are
my friends out there.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.600
Let me go get them
and I'll meet you back in this.

41:44.696 --> 41:46.201
Okay? Alright.

41:46.236 --> 41:47.891
See you soon.

41:51.095 --> 41:52.561
- "Kiss my Sticky" by Betty -

41:59.007 --> 42:00.532
<b>...</b>

42:00.577 --> 42:04.092
No, I wanna say that
she really surprised me today

42:04.128 --> 42:06.033
and I'm very proud of her.

42:06.067 --> 42:10.003
And I'm very happy and proud
to be her girlfriend.

42:13.075 --> 42:14.861
- To Alice!
- Thank you.

42:19.305 --> 42:20.963
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:34.058 --> 42:35.502
Holy shit!

42:40.527 --> 42:41.902
Okay, finish. So,

42:41.938 --> 42:43.932
she fired you
and then she kissed you?

42:43.938 --> 42:46.061
Technically, I resigned.

42:46.105 --> 42:47.753
And she didn't make out
with me. There is no way

42:47.797 --> 42:49.072
that I was gonna
make out with her.

42:49.107 --> 42:51.302
It was one of the most
terrifying moments of my life.

42:51.637 --> 42:53.301
What? What's happening?

42:53.376 --> 42:56.010
I just saw
Jenny and Shane in the car.

42:56.045 --> 42:58.221
Shane's hand was all up Jenny's skirt and

42:58.298 --> 43:00.851
Jenny's tongue is
all going down Shane's throat.

43:00.888 --> 43:01.663
What?

43:01.708 --> 43:03.641
You don't know how to check
your text messages, do you?

43:04.165 --> 43:07.421
Is that what my phone
was doing all the buzzing about?

43:08.416 --> 43:09.312
I can't...

43:09.357 --> 43:10.833
- All the kids are doing it.
- Shhh.

43:23.596 --> 43:24.883
Why are you laughing?

43:27.096 --> 43:28.970
Nothing. Just,
we were talking about this...

43:29.015 --> 43:30.843
Nah, I had something in my throat,
and I...

43:34.346 --> 43:35.362
Alright. You know what?

43:35.727 --> 43:39.341
Here is to Kit and Helena.
This place is fabulous.

43:41.386 --> 43:42.692
Thank you.

43:43.235 --> 43:45.051
It's like night and day.

43:45.095 --> 43:46.760
- Cheers, Kit.
- Thank you.

43:49.017 --> 43:50.752
You showed up all by yourself.

43:51.956 --> 43:53.541
Very nice.

43:56.858 --> 43:57.821
What?

44:03.795 --> 44:06.541
I think this place looks
really beautiful.

44:06.885 --> 44:08.502
You guys did a great job.

44:08.535 --> 44:10.712
- Thank you.
- Did you

44:11.435 --> 44:13.703
- do it yourself?
- Yeah, we did.

44:13.747 --> 44:15.562
We wanted it to look like,
you know,

44:15.608 --> 44:17.360
"Casablanca",

44:17.376 --> 44:19.330
"Studio 54"...

44:19.367 --> 44:20.560
Right.

44:24.337 --> 44:27.012
And you should see
what we did with the VIP room.

44:27.028 --> 44:28.732
- Where is it?
- It's up there.

44:28.775 --> 44:30.940
- Can I go? I'm gonna go see it.
- Yeah.

44:30.987 --> 44:31.840
Go see it.

44:31.888 --> 44:33.851
And tell me
what you think about it.

44:33.887 --> 44:35.510
- I definitively will.
- Okay.

44:37.836 --> 44:39.021
Wait, Kit,

44:40.648 --> 44:42.863
how big is this place?
You said there's two levels?

44:42.895 --> 44:44.932
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Where's the other one?

44:44.967 --> 44:46.993
Next to the VIP room.

44:47.036 --> 44:49.310
It's like another level,
private.

44:49.357 --> 44:50.912
I didn't even see it when I came in.
Can I check it out?

44:50.928 --> 44:52.082
Oh yeah, absolutely.

44:52.755 --> 44:53.732
You'll love it.

44:57.748 --> 44:59.312
Oh, there's a second floor?

45:01.498 --> 45:03.033
She might know someone
up there. Who knows?

45:03.078 --> 45:04.691
Oh, right.

45:04.726 --> 45:05.780
Oooh, maybe.

45:07.128 --> 45:08.402

45:08.435 --> 45:10.860
Now, where's the fabulous
Kit Porter?

I don't know.

45:57.258 --> 45:58.403
How are you?

45:59.575 --> 46:00.833
I'm fine, it's just...

46:01.867 --> 46:03.910
I don't know about them.
I just wanna make sure.

46:04.337 --> 46:05.902
Wouah, 3 o'clock.

46:05.936 --> 46:08.911

I don't care.

46:22.787 --> 46:24.530
I really don't. It's...
