WEBVTT

00:07.838 --> 00:09.509
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.261
UGH! I JUST RECEIVED

00:11.262 --> 00:13.683
THE MOST MASSIVELY INAPPROPRIATE
TEXT FROM ZANDER.

00:13.684 --> 00:15.135
YEAH, I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT
AND I DON'T WANNA SEE IT.

00:15.136 --> 00:18.017
"THINKING OF YOU. SMILEY FACE."

00:18.018 --> 00:21.982
HOW IS THAT TEXT INAPPROPRIATE?
WHAT, IS HIS SMILEY FACE NAKED?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.984
NO. WE'RE BROKEN UP, OKAY?

00:24.985 --> 00:26.106
NO ONE IS SMILING.

00:26.107 --> 00:28.068
AND HE SHOULDN'T BE
SENDING THINGS LIKE THIS.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.990
AND YOU SHOULD BE
INDIGNANT FOR ME.

00:30.951 --> 00:32.113
HOW DARE HE.

00:33.704 --> 00:35.205
WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE SO NICE?

00:35.206 --> 00:38.368
WHY CAN'T HE JUST BE A JERK
LIKE EVERY OTHER EX-BOYFRIEND?

00:38.369 --> 00:40.370
OKAY, OUT OF MY WAY!

00:40.371 --> 00:41.621
LATE CITY COUNCILWOMAN
COMING THROUGH!

00:41.622 --> 00:43.503
OKAY, BYE-BYE. LOVE EVERYBODY.

00:43.504 --> 00:45.925
- HEY, DON'T FORGET YOUR COFFEE.
- NO, NO TIME FOR COFFEE.

00:45.926 --> 00:48.007
OH, WHY CAN'T THEY JUST
MAKE A DAMN CAFFEINE PATCH?

00:48.008 --> 00:51.591
YEAH, I KNOW. OR LIKE A CUP
WITH MAYBE LIKE A LID?

00:51.592 --> 00:53.303
PATCH WOULD BE EASIER.
YOU JUST SLAP IT ON,

00:53.304 --> 00:55.095
AND YOU'RE BUZZED FOR A WEEK.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.436
YOU'RE FORGETTING
SOMETHING ELSE, TOO.

00:56.437 --> 00:57.677
NO, I HAVE UNDERWEAR ON.

00:57.678 --> 00:59.600
IT'S JUST SEAMLESS. FEEL.

01:00.891 --> 01:02.892
THAT'S VERY NICE.
THAT'S VERY NICE.

01:02.893 --> 01:05.275
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DRESS
YOU'RE GONNA BE WEARING

01:05.276 --> 01:06.526
TO THE PRESS ASSOCIATION
DINNER TONIGHT.

01:06.527 --> 01:07.567
I PICKED IT UP FOR YOU
AT THE DRY CLEANER'S.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.569
OH, THE PRESS DINNER'S TONIGHT.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.152
- THANKS FOR REMINDING ME.
- YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE YOUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY

01:12.153 --> 01:14.954
TO SHOW OFF YOUR NEW LONGO-BRAND
ARM CANDY IN PUBLIC.

01:14.955 --> 01:17.907
IT'S GONNA BE A PRETTY
SWEET MOMENT FOR YOU.

01:17.908 --> 01:20.830
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D RATHER BE TAKING
YOURSELF TO THIS DINNER TONIGHT.

01:20.831 --> 01:24.465
PLEASE, IF I WAS DATING ME, WE'D
NEVER MAKE IT OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

LEEMAN PUT US TOGETHER.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.903
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER GUYS
WHO GET ALL WEIRD AROUND ME.

01:53.904 --> 01:55.945
NO, I'M PRETTY MUCH JUST
WEIRD ALL THE TIME,

01:55.946 --> 01:57.737
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY STAND OUT.

01:57.738 --> 02:00.790
OH. WELL, WHATEVER YOU'RE
DOING WORKS FOR YOU.

02:00.791 --> 02:02.372
( laughs ) I SHOULD GET HOME.

02:02.373 --> 02:03.873
I'LL SEE YOU IN CLASS TOMORROW?

02:03.874 --> 02:06.876
YEAH YEAH, I'LL GRAB US A TABLE
BY THE EYE-WASH STATION.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.248
THOSE SEATS GO FAST.

02:08.249 --> 02:12.252
YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING
TO SEE THE WEIRDNESS.

02:12.253 --> 02:13.964
( both chuckle )

02:15.516 --> 02:17.807
- ( door closes )
- SHE LIKES YOU.

02:17.808 --> 02:18.968
WHAT?

02:18.969 --> 02:21.261
NO, SHE... SHE'S MY LAB PARTNER.

02:21.262 --> 02:22.892
NO NO NO. SHE GAVE YOU
THE SHOULDER BRUSH.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.314
- SHE LIKES YOU.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:24.315 --> 02:25.525
WHEN SHE WALKED OUT THE DOOR,

02:25.526 --> 02:26.766
SHE GAVE YOU THE SHOULDER BRUSH.

02:26.767 --> 02:29.479
SHE WAS MARKING YOU, BUDDY.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.941
"THIS ONE'S MINE."

02:31.942 --> 02:33.613
JOE, YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT?

02:33.614 --> 02:34.984
I'M JUST NOT MAKING
THIS STUFF UP, PAL.

02:34.985 --> 02:36.946
A GIRL GAVE ME THE
SHOULDER BRUSH ONCE...

02:36.947 --> 02:38.778
WE DIDN'T COME OUT OF HER
APARTMENT FOR THREE DAYS.

02:38.779 --> 02:40.331
WAS IT SNOWING OR SOMETHING?

02:41.912 --> 02:44.244
OH! OH.

02:44.245 --> 02:45.955
SO YOU GOING TO ASK HER OUT?

02:45.956 --> 02:47.837
UH, NO. THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:47.838 --> 02:50.590
SHE'S... SHE'S GOT A LOT OF
STUFF GOING ON IN HER LIFE.

02:50.591 --> 02:53.002
- IN FACT, SHE'S ACTUALLY...
- I'M HEARING A LOT OF EXCUSES.

02:53.003 --> 02:55.255
THE QUESTION IS: IF YOU COULD,
WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH HER?

02:55.256 --> 02:57.387
SURE, BUT I DON'T
THINK IT WOULD WORK.

02:57.388 --> 02:59.599
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO,
YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.431
BUT, JOE, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE HEARING ME.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.473
WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT...

03:03.474 --> 03:05.225
DUDE, HERE COMES ANOTHER EXCUSE.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.937
SHOULDER BRUSH... BOOM.
CASE CLOSED.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.309
YOU KNOW WHAT... YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:09.310 --> 03:11.941
I WILL ASK HER OUT.
WELL, THANKS, JOE.

03:11.942 --> 03:12.903
NO NEED TO THANK ME.

03:12.904 --> 03:15.575
JUST CONSIDER IT A
PUBLIC SERVICE.

03:15.576 --> 03:17.026
I JUST GAVE YOU A FREE
SCHOLARSHIP, BUDDY,

03:17.027 --> 03:20.661
TO THE LONGO INSTITUTE
OF LADY-LOVING.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.667
DON'T TELL YOUR AUNT THAT'S
WHAT I CALL THAT COLLEGE.

03:27.668 --> 03:28.749
YEAH, UNDERSTOOD.

03:31.332 --> 03:33.593
AND THIS IS MY
BOYFRIEND, JOE LONGO.

03:33.594 --> 03:35.004
HELLO. HI.

03:35.005 --> 03:36.336
HE'S A WAITER.

03:36.337 --> 03:38.838
I LIKE SHOWING YOU OFF.
CAN'T I BE PROUD?

03:38.839 --> 03:40.720
SHE'S RIGHT TO BE PROUD.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.682
HAVING A GOOD-LOOKING PIECE
OF MAN MEAT ON YOUR ARM

03:42.683 --> 03:44.894
NEVER HURT A CAMPAIGN.

03:44.895 --> 03:45.975
OH, SORRY TO CALL
YOU "MAN MEAT."

03:45.976 --> 03:46.976
NO, I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.518
YOU'RE JUST CALLING
IT HOW YOU SEE IT.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.899
JOE, YOU KNOW JANEY.

03:49.900 --> 03:50.900
SHE'S HANDLING MY
CAMPAIGN FOR NEXT YEAR.

03:50.901 --> 03:52.442
ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S A SMART MOVE.

03:52.443 --> 03:54.354
SHE'S GOT EXCELLENT TASTE IN...

03:54.355 --> 03:56.025
IN MAN MEAT.

03:56.026 --> 03:57.947
ACTUALLY, I'M A PESCATARIAN.

03:57.948 --> 03:59.068
YOU AND ME BOTH, BABY.

03:59.069 --> 04:01.911
CAN I GET YOU LADIES
SOMETHING FROM THE BAR?

04:01.912 --> 04:03.863
OH, NO DRINKING FOR ME.
THIS IS A WORK EVENT.

04:03.864 --> 04:06.786
PUT IT IN A WATER
GLASS, KEEP IT CLEAR.

04:06.787 --> 04:08.788
SHE'S GOOD.

04:08.789 --> 04:10.790
STEALTH MARTINI,
COMING RIGHT UP.

04:10.791 --> 04:13.002
HEY, MEL, HEADS UP. THAT
REPORTER FROM "THE HERALD,"

04:13.003 --> 04:14.043
THE ONE WITH THE BAD BREATH...

04:14.044 --> 04:15.965
OKAY, YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

04:15.966 --> 04:17.837
KIND OF GARLICKY SMELLING...

04:17.838 --> 04:19.258
NO NO NO. DO YOU HAVE A NAME?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.010
BILL NITSKI.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.222
HE'S GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT
BELLFLOWER CONCERT HALL.

04:23.223 --> 04:26.015
THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY'S
MAKING ANOTHER RUN

04:26.016 --> 04:27.186
TO SAVE THAT PRECIOUS DUMP.

04:27.187 --> 04:28.598
BUT THE DEVELOPERS
WANT TO TEAR IT DOWN.

04:28.599 --> 04:30.770
- SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS...
- MAKE EVERYBODY THINK

04:30.771 --> 04:32.231
- I'M ON THEIR SIDE.
- SO JUST CHARM HIM.

04:32.232 --> 04:35.195
NO SWEAT. NOT MY FIRST TIME
AT THE BUTT-KISSING RODEO.

04:36.397 --> 04:37.947
( laughs )

04:37.948 --> 04:39.899
PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT MEL BURKE,

04:39.900 --> 04:40.900
AND I SAY, "I DON'T KNOW."

04:40.901 --> 04:42.532
SO I GOTTA ASK YOU
THE BIG QUESTION...

04:42.533 --> 04:44.243
LET ME GUESS. WHO AM I WEARING?

04:44.244 --> 04:46.536
I'D RATHER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE HIDING.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.538
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION
ON BELLFLOWER HALL?

04:48.539 --> 04:50.249
WELL, BILL, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE ARE PASSIONATE

04:50.250 --> 04:51.961
ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS
COMPLICATED ISSUE.

04:51.962 --> 04:53.963
I'M NOT PLAYING
DODGEBALL, BURKE.

04:53.964 --> 04:56.175
TEAR DOWN THE CONCERT HALL...
YES OR NO?

04:56.176 --> 04:57.967
LOOK, UNTIL WE HEAR FROM
THE MAYOR'S COMMISSION,

04:57.968 --> 04:59.969
CAN ANYONE REALLY SAY
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?

04:59.970 --> 05:01.761
I CAN.

05:01.762 --> 05:03.553
KNOCK THAT OLD HEAP OFF THE MAP.

05:03.554 --> 05:04.974
GIVE ME A SLEDGEHAMMER
IN FIVE MINUTES.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.096
- I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
- AND YOU ARE?

05:07.097 --> 05:09.519
OH, I'M JOE LONGO.
I'M MEL'S BOYFRIEND.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.351
I'M JUST SAYING ANYONE
WITH HALF A BRAIN

05:11.352 --> 05:13.312
CAN REALIZE THAT
RICKETY OLD HEAP

05:13.313 --> 05:15.815
IS JUST BEGGING TO BE
PUT OUT OF ITS MISERY.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.697
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE A
TUMOR-RIDDLED DOG,

05:17.698 --> 05:19.609
JUST LOOKING TOWARDS DEATH.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.821
I MEAN, SURE,
EVERYBODY LOVES FIDO,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.783
BUT AT SOME POINT YOU GOTTA SAY,

05:23.784 --> 05:27.286
"FIDO, THERE'S A FRISBEE IN
HEAVEN WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

05:27.287 --> 05:28.908
( chuckling )

05:28.909 --> 05:30.580
YOU KNOW, ONE THING ABOUT JOE...

05:30.581 --> 05:33.623
HE IS SURE HANDSOME, ISN'T HE?

05:33.624 --> 05:36.335
THANK YOU FOR INVITING JOE, MEL.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.417
TALKING TO SOMEONE LIKE JOE

05:37.418 --> 05:40.220
MAKES MY JOB A LOT EASIER.

05:41.882 --> 05:43.513
SEEMS LIKE A NICE FELLA.

05:43.514 --> 05:44.884
ANYONE ELSE YOU
WANT ME TO TALK TO?

05:44.885 --> 05:45.806
I CAN REALLY TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING.

05:45.807 --> 05:48.888
THE MIDDLE EAST, RELIGION...

05:48.889 --> 05:51.561
I'M GONNA GO DO DAMAGE CONTROL.

05:51.562 --> 05:52.892
( sighs )

05:52.893 --> 05:54.233
WHY COULDN'T YOU DATE A CUTE GUY

05:54.234 --> 05:55.645
WHO DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING?

05:55.646 --> 05:57.067
I MEAN, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!

05:58.939 --> 06:00.029
DAMAGE CONTROL? FOR WHAT?

06:00.030 --> 06:02.241
- ( inhales )
- HMM.

06:02.242 --> 06:03.983
THAT'S A NEW LOOK ON YOU.

06:03.984 --> 06:07.537
YOU'RE ALMOST
SMILING, BUT YOUR...

06:07.538 --> 06:09.118
YOUR EYES ARE VERY ANGRY.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.492
LISTEN TO THE EYES, JOE.

06:14.915 --> 06:16.836
OKAY, THESE ARE THE THREE
LATEST "CASSANDRA" STORIES

06:16.837 --> 06:18.167
FOR THE WEB SERIES.

06:18.168 --> 06:19.208
THANKS FOR PRINTING THEM OUT.

06:19.209 --> 06:20.800
IT'S A 12-HOUR DRIVE TO VERMONT,

06:20.801 --> 06:21.961
SO THIS WILL GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO READ

06:21.962 --> 06:23.673
WHILE MY DAD'S YELLING
AT TALK RADIO.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.716
READING ON THE ROAD?
DON'T GET CARSICK.

06:26.717 --> 06:28.848
AW, THANKS. YOU STILL
CARE ABOUT ME.

06:28.849 --> 06:30.600
NO, I JUST DON'T WANT
YOU BLOWING CHUNKS

06:30.601 --> 06:31.932
ALL OVER MY BEAUTIFUL STORIES.

06:33.724 --> 06:35.144
LESS SWEET, BUT OKAY.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.937
WELL, HERE WE ARE,

06:37.938 --> 06:39.519
TWO EXES...

06:39.520 --> 06:41.360
ONE OF THEM GOING
AWAY TO COLLEGE

06:41.361 --> 06:43.823
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS.

06:43.824 --> 06:46.696
IT'S THE BIG GOODBYE.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.789
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.831
HOW ABOUT "GOODBYE"?

06:51.832 --> 06:54.584
GOODBYE, YEAH... THAT'S
WHY YOU'RE THE WRITER.

06:54.585 --> 06:57.997
YOU'RE SO GOOD WITH WORDS.

06:57.998 --> 06:58.959
GOODBYE, LENNOX.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.541
GOODBYE, ZANDER.

07:03.383 --> 07:05.926
GOODBYE, LENNOX.

07:06.967 --> 07:08.307
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

07:08.308 --> 07:10.930
RIGHT.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.052
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU.

07:14.765 --> 07:16.015
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

07:16.016 --> 07:18.017
YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST
HAVING DIFFICULTY

07:18.018 --> 07:19.689
ACCEPTING THAT WE'RE
NOT A COUPLE ANYMORE.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.321
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE HUNDREDS OF
MILES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

07:22.322 --> 07:23.943
SO THIS IS FOR THE BEST.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.445
IT'S TIME HE JUST LETS GO AND
STARTS DATING OTHER GUYS.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.367
- GUYS?
- GIRLS.

07:28.368 --> 07:29.989
OF COURSE GIRLS.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.871
IF I SAID "GUYS," I'D BE
TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE,

07:31.872 --> 07:33.533
AND I'M NOT. CAN
WE JUST DROP IT?

07:33.534 --> 07:35.454
OKAY.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.956
I MEAN, YOU SAW HIM.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.167
HE WAS TRYING TO SNEAK
IN ONE LAST KISS

07:38.168 --> 07:39.418
BEFORE HE LEFT.

07:39.419 --> 07:41.210
IT'S OVER, PAL.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.003
WHO ARE YOU ARGUING WITH?

07:44.004 --> 07:45.384
TRUST ME... IF
ZANDER AND I TRIED

07:45.385 --> 07:46.926
TO HAVE A LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIP,

07:46.927 --> 07:47.927
ALL WE WOULD DO IS FIGHT.

07:47.928 --> 07:50.009
AND WHO WOULD WANT A
RELATIONSHIP LIKE THAT?

07:50.010 --> 07:51.430
I CAN'T TAKE YOU ANYWHERE!

07:51.431 --> 07:52.802
OH, PLEASE, I WAS
DOING YOU A FAVOR.

07:52.803 --> 07:53.893
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
OPEN YOUR BIG MOUTH?

07:53.894 --> 07:55.805
I JUST SAID WHAT EVERYBODY
ELSE WAS THINKING.

07:55.806 --> 07:58.017
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING...
WHY DID I BRING YOU TO THAT EVENT?

07:58.018 --> 07:59.398
OH, I MADE YOU LOOK GOOD.
I'M AN ASSET.

07:59.399 --> 08:01.811
IT'S PRONOUNCED "ASS HAT."

08:01.812 --> 08:03.813
WHAT DID I DO THAT WAS SO WRONG?

08:03.814 --> 08:05.154
ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.316
THE TRUTH IS TAKING A STAND
ON THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW

08:07.317 --> 08:09.529
COULD END MY STATE SENATE
CAMPAIGN BEFORE IT EVEN BEGINS.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.281
I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT
VOTES ARE IN YOUR BUSINESS.

08:12.282 --> 08:14.704
BUT EVEN YOU YOURSELF SAID THAT
CONCERT HALL IS ABOUT TO FALL DOWN.

08:14.705 --> 08:17.957
SO IS MY MOM'S FACE, BUT I'M
NOT GONNA YANK IT OFF MYSELF.

08:17.958 --> 08:20.039
IT'S NOT JUST UGLY, ALL
RIGHT, IT'S A HAZARD.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.752
THAT'S MY MOTHER
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.123
OH. THE CONCERT HALL.

08:24.124 --> 08:25.254
OR IN YOUR WORDS...

08:25.255 --> 08:28.337
FIDO, THE SAD, OLD TUMOR DOG.

08:28.338 --> 08:30.760
JOE, WHAT YOU SAY AT THESE
EVENTS REFLECTS ON ME.

08:30.761 --> 08:31.931
WE'RE TREATED AS A UNIT NOW.

08:31.932 --> 08:33.392
YEAH, WELL, ONE HALF
OF US GETS TO SPEAK

08:33.393 --> 08:35.224
- AND THE OTHER HALF DOESN'T.
- EXACTLY!

08:35.225 --> 08:37.016
AND JUST LIKE THE PRESIDENT.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.188
THE FIRST LADY DOESN'T CHIME
IN ON FOREIGN POLICY.

08:39.189 --> 08:40.810
SHE JUST SHAKES HANDS
AND STARES LOVINGLY

08:40.811 --> 08:43.853
AT HER WISE, POWERFUL SPOUSE.

08:43.854 --> 08:45.524
SO I'M MICHELLE OBAMA.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.236
PEOPLE LOVE HER.

08:47.237 --> 08:48.738
BE LOVED, JOE.

08:48.739 --> 08:51.821
BE SILENT AND LOVED.

08:51.822 --> 08:52.952
YOU JUST DON'T WANT ME TO BE ME.

08:52.953 --> 08:54.704
ONLY IN PUBLIC.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.535
WHEN NO ONE'S AROUND, YOU
CAN BE YOU ALL YOU LIKE.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.828
JOE IT ALL UP IN HERE.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.209
OH, GREAT! ALL RIGHT.
SO WHEN WE'RE HOME,

09:00.210 --> 09:01.961
FROM NOW ON, I'LL MAKE SURE
I CLOSE ALL THE DRAPES.

09:01.962 --> 09:03.753
THAT WAY NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS
WILL HAVE TO SEE THE REAL ME.

09:03.754 --> 09:05.424
PLEASE, JOE.

09:05.425 --> 09:07.046
IF THE NEIGHBORS ARE
PEEKING IN THE WINDOW,

09:07.047 --> 09:08.629
THEY'RE DEFINITELY
LOOKING AT ME.

09:16.727 --> 09:17.767
I JUST SAID WHAT I WAS THINKING.

09:17.768 --> 09:18.888
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MEL.

09:18.889 --> 09:20.890
MM, THIS FROM "THE
TOLEDO HERALD"...

09:20.891 --> 09:23.643
"WELL, IF MEL BURKE'S
BOYFRIEND SPEAKS FOR HER,

09:23.644 --> 09:24.984
THE CITY HAS NO INTENTION

09:24.985 --> 09:26.105
OF SAVING BELLFLOWER HALL.

09:26.106 --> 09:27.356
PERHAPS, IN THE FUTURE,
IF WE WANT TO KNOW

09:27.357 --> 09:29.779
WHAT THE WAFFLING
COUNCILWOMAN THINKS,

09:29.780 --> 09:33.953
WE SHOULD JUST TALK TO HER
FEARLESSLY OPINIONATED DATE."

09:33.954 --> 09:35.955
YOU GONNA BLAME THAT ON ME?

09:35.956 --> 09:39.288
YOU THINK A DENVER OMELET WILL HELP
SMOOTH THINGS OVER WITH YOUR AUNT?

09:39.289 --> 09:41.411
YOU SURE AS HELL BETTER
NOT MAKE HER A WAFFLE.

09:43.253 --> 09:44.964
MORNING, LENNOX.

09:44.965 --> 09:45.966
YOU.

09:46.757 --> 09:48.507
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

09:48.508 --> 09:51.050
YEAH, WELL, MY PHONE STARTED
RINGING AT 5:00 THIS MORNING.

09:51.051 --> 09:52.712
NOW I HAVE AN EMERGENCY MEETING

09:52.713 --> 09:54.593
WITH THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY
TO CALM THEM DOWN.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.425
OH, AND THEN I HAVE
SENSITIVITY TRAINING

09:56.426 --> 09:57.767
AT THE HUMANE SOCIETY.

09:57.768 --> 10:00.099
THEY WANT ME TO SPEND THE
AFTERNOON AT A DOG HOSPICE.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.891
IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT DAY.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.893
MEL...

10:03.894 --> 10:05.394
I'M SORRY.

10:05.395 --> 10:07.396
ALL RIGHT? I GET IT NOW.

10:07.397 --> 10:08.938
THERE'S A TIME AND A
PLACE FOR MY OPINIONS

10:08.939 --> 10:10.069
AND LAST NIGHT
WASN'T ONE OF THEM.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.901
SO I SHOULD JUST LEARN
TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT

10:11.902 --> 10:13.362
AT YOUR WORK FUNCTIONS,
AND FROM NOW ON,

10:13.363 --> 10:14.533
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

10:14.534 --> 10:16.866
- YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?
- YES, I DO.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.368
IN FACT, I'VE EVEN BEEN
WORKING ON MY ADMIRING

10:19.369 --> 10:21.581
AND LOVING FIRST-LADY GAZE.

10:25.746 --> 10:27.507
IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

10:29.509 --> 10:31.171
WELL, I THINK YOU'D MAKE
A GREAT FIRST LADY.

10:33.593 --> 10:35.634
I'M SORRY.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.556
YOU'RE PROBABLY WEIRDED OUT
BY ALL THIS FIRST-LADY TALK.

10:37.557 --> 10:38.637
- LET ME EXPLAIN.
- NO NO NO.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.759
THAT'S TOTALLY UNNECESSARY.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.853
WHATEVER YOU TWO NEED
TO KEEP IT FRESH.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.727
I DON'T KNOW.

10:47.728 --> 10:50.479
I THINK, ACCORDING
TO MY CALCULATIONS,

10:50.480 --> 10:53.482
THE DATA ALL POINTS TO US
GETTING COFFEE TOGETHER.

10:53.483 --> 10:54.904
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

10:54.905 --> 10:57.156
SORRY, THAT WAS OUT OF LINE.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.578
THE DATA ALL POINTS
TO US GETTING...

10:59.579 --> 11:01.330
- ( sighs )
- FROZEN YOGURT, MAYBE?

11:01.331 --> 11:03.662
YOU'RE VERY SWEET,

11:03.663 --> 11:05.334
BUT I HAVE SO MUCH
GOING ON RIGHT NOW

11:05.335 --> 11:07.167
AND IT WOULD JUST MAKE
THINGS COMPLICATED.

11:09.249 --> 11:13.383
STELLA, ALL I'M HEARING
ARE EXCUSES HERE.

11:14.755 --> 11:16.846
I THINK WE CAN MAKE THIS
WORK IF WE REALLY WANT TO.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.758
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN HANDLE

11:18.759 --> 11:20.349
GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME?

11:20.350 --> 11:22.641
HONESTLY, I'M SCARED
OUT OF MY MIND.

11:22.642 --> 11:25.474
BUT... I'M HAPPY
TO GO DOWN TRYING.

11:25.475 --> 11:27.767
WELL, WE DO HAVE CHEMISTRY.

11:27.768 --> 11:30.269
DO YOU MEAN THE CLASS

11:30.270 --> 11:32.191
OR DO YOU ACTUALLY
KIND OF LIKE ME?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.773
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:33.774 --> 11:35.905
RIGHT. ( chuckles )

11:35.906 --> 11:37.026
( clears throat )

11:37.027 --> 11:38.367
NO, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH.
WHICH ONE?

11:38.368 --> 11:39.448
I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.700
( chuckles )

11:42.873 --> 11:45.745
LENNOX, COULD YOU TAKE THIS
TO THE DRY CLEANER FOR ME?

11:45.746 --> 11:47.827
I HAVE THE POLICEMAN'S
BALL THIS THURSDAY.

11:47.828 --> 11:49.168
( gasps ) OH, WOW.

11:49.169 --> 11:51.420
AUNT MEL, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

11:51.421 --> 11:54.293
YOU AND JOE ARE GOING TO BE
THE MOST EPIC COUPLE THERE.

11:54.294 --> 11:56.425
MM-HMM, MM-HMM, YEAH.
HE'S NOT GOING.

11:56.426 --> 12:00.259
OH, SO I'M TAKING THE DRESS
TO THE DRY CLEANER'S

12:00.260 --> 12:02.972
BECAUSE JOE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.974
I DIDN'T SAY THAT, BUT YES.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.476
BUT HE PROMISED HE'D
BE QUIET FROM NOW ON.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.688
LOOK, I LOVE JOE,
BUT I KNOW JOE.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.060
SURE, HE THINKS HE CAN
KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

12:11.061 --> 12:13.232
HE ALSO THINKS HIS SHIRTS
ARE NEVER TOO TIGHT.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.814
SOMEONE WILL ASK HIM
ABOUT AN ISSUE,

12:14.815 --> 12:16.856
AND HE'LL TRY HIS
BEST TO HOLD IT IN,

12:16.857 --> 12:18.527
- BUT IN THE END...
- HE'LL BLOW LIKE A VOLCANO.

12:18.528 --> 12:19.568
BIG TIME.

12:19.569 --> 12:21.120
AND THE VERBAL LAVA WILL DESTROY

12:21.121 --> 12:23.322
THE TINY TOWN OF ME-VILLE.

12:23.323 --> 12:25.955
SO I'VE DECIDED TO GO
TO THE BALL BY MYSELF.

12:25.956 --> 12:27.997
IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF MY RELATIONSHIP.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.829
AND THE BEST INTEREST
OF YOUR CAREER.

12:29.830 --> 12:31.921
EVERYBODY WINS. ME TWICE.

12:31.922 --> 12:33.542
YEAH, BUT WON'T JOE
KIND OF NOTICE

12:33.543 --> 12:34.753
THAT YOU WENT TO THE
BALL WITHOUT HIM?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.375
BUT LUCKILY HE HAS
PLANS THAT NIGHT

12:36.376 --> 12:37.797
DOING SOMETHING HE
ABSOLUTELY LOVES.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.138
- OH, WHAT'S THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

12:39.139 --> 12:41.301
BUT I'M WORKING ON IT.

12:45.595 --> 12:48.017
DUDE... I TOLD YOU BEFORE, MAN.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.518
IF YOU WANT THAT
THING TO MAKE TOAST,

12:49.519 --> 12:52.191
YOU GOTTA PUT BREAD IN IT.

12:52.192 --> 12:54.814
NO, I WAS JUST CHECKING
MY EYEBROWS FOR STRAYS.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.106
'CAUSE I GOT A DATE
TONIGHT WITH STELLA,

12:57.107 --> 12:58.898
AND I WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT.

12:58.899 --> 13:00.609
NICE! ALL RIGHT. WHERE ARE
YOU GOING TO TAKE HER?

13:00.610 --> 13:01.821
A FANCY RESTAURANT,
THE MOVIES, WHAT?

13:01.822 --> 13:04.073
THE LIVING ROOM.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.495
LADIES, THEY LOVE A BIG SPENDER.

13:06.496 --> 13:08.958
NO, ACTUALLY, SHE WANTED
TO COME OVER HERE.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.960
SHE SAID IT'D BE COZIER.

13:10.961 --> 13:12.251
LOOK AT YOU!

13:12.252 --> 13:13.672
GETTING YOURSELF A
ROMANTIC EVENING

13:13.673 --> 13:15.084
WITHOUT HAVING TO
SHELL OUT A DIME.

13:15.085 --> 13:18.007
MAYBE I COULD LEARN
A LESSON FROM YOU.

13:18.008 --> 13:20.299
NO, WHO AM I KIDDING?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.720
HELLO, MY MEN.

13:21.721 --> 13:22.922
HEY! GOOD NEWS HERE.

13:22.923 --> 13:24.383
YOUNG SQUIRE JUST
SECURED HIMSELF A DATE

13:24.384 --> 13:25.885
WITH HIS STUDY PARTNER STELLA.

13:25.886 --> 13:27.226
- THANKS TO WHO?
- YOU, JOE.

13:27.227 --> 13:28.347
THERE IT IS.

13:28.348 --> 13:29.849
WOW, NICE WORK.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.310
BUT IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO IMPRESS HER,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.692
YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT
ALL THAT NOSE HAIR UP THERE.

13:33.693 --> 13:36.316
OH, GOD, IT'S LIKE A
RAIN FOREST UP THERE.

13:37.898 --> 13:39.899
SO YOU'RE TEACHING
THE KID SOME MOVES?

13:39.900 --> 13:41.240
YEAH! WELL, YOU KNOW,
LAST YEAR I HELPED HIM

13:41.241 --> 13:42.862
BRING UP HIS GRADES.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.995
AND THIS YEAR I'M HELPING
HIM TO BRING UP HIS...

13:45.996 --> 13:48.747
I GOT HIM A DATE.

13:48.748 --> 13:50.539
WELL, YOU'RE A GOOD GUY, JOE.

13:50.540 --> 13:51.750
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WE GET GOOD GUYS?

13:51.751 --> 13:55.164
A GREAT SEAT AT THE MUD
HENS GAME TONIGHT.

13:55.165 --> 13:57.666
WHAT? THESE ARE RIGHT
BEHIND THE DUGOUT.

13:57.667 --> 13:58.878
MEL, THAT'S AWESOME.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.299
IT'S JUST ONE TICKET, THOUGH.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.510
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU
HERE ALL BY YOURSELF.

14:01.511 --> 14:02.882
YES, YOU CAN. THAT'S THE POINT.

14:02.883 --> 14:06.926
BECAUSE I HAVE THIS BORING
WORK THING TONIGHT.

14:06.927 --> 14:09.388
JUST BORING POLICE DEPARTMENT...
BORING.

14:09.389 --> 14:11.891
SO AT LEAST ONE OF US
WILL HAVE FUN TONIGHT.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.102
YOU BETTER GET GOING, THOUGH,

14:13.103 --> 14:14.183
IF YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE FIRST PITCH.

14:14.184 --> 14:15.564
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE A QUICK PEE.

14:15.565 --> 14:17.476
( stammers ) JUST
GO AT THE STADIUM.

14:17.477 --> 14:21.190
URINALS ARE SO MUCH MORE FUN
THAN BORING OLD TOILETS.

14:21.191 --> 14:22.242
YOU'RE NOT WRONG.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.699
- HEY.
- HEY.

14:30.700 --> 14:31.911
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.582
OH, YOUR AUNT GOT ME
THIS AWESOME SEAT

14:33.583 --> 14:34.914
FOR TONIGHT'S MUD HENS GAME,

14:34.915 --> 14:36.705
AND I FORGOT MY LUCKY
NUMBER ONE FOAM FINGER.

14:36.706 --> 14:38.707
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THEIR VICTORIES,

14:38.708 --> 14:39.878
BUT, YOU KNOW...

14:39.879 --> 14:41.631
WHEN I BRING IT, THEY WIN.

14:45.055 --> 14:47.386
LENNOX, RYDER! I'M LEAVING!

14:47.387 --> 14:48.847
IF JOE GETS BACK
BEFORE ME, JUST...

14:48.848 --> 14:51.811
TELL HIM I LOVE HIM
WITH ALL OF MY HEART.

14:53.063 --> 14:55.895
YOU.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.363
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

15:04.364 --> 15:05.574
REALLY?

15:05.575 --> 15:07.076
SO I THINK YOU SENT ME TO
A BASEBALL GAME TONIGHT

15:07.077 --> 15:08.327
SO YOU COULD DITCH ME.

15:08.328 --> 15:09.788
SO YOU CAN GO TO
YOUR FANCY PARTY.

15:09.789 --> 15:12.121
( scoffs ) WHERE'D YOU GET
A CRAZY IDEA LIKE THAT?

15:12.122 --> 15:14.033
LET'S SEE HERE...

15:14.034 --> 15:15.834
"YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
TO THE 41ST ANNUAL

15:15.835 --> 15:19.668
TOLEDO POLICEMAN'S BALL...
MEL BURKE PLUS ONE."

15:19.669 --> 15:20.919
SO YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE
ME WHEN I TOLD YOU

15:20.920 --> 15:22.421
I WAS GOING TO KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.502
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED
TO BE SEEN WITH ME.

15:23.503 --> 15:25.544
NO, I LOVE BEING SEEN WITH YOU.

15:25.545 --> 15:28.097
ALWAYS. WELL, 95% OF THE TIME.

15:28.098 --> 15:30.429
WHICH IS A SUPER-HIGH NUMBER.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.720
SO YOU'RE ONLY EMBARRASSED
TO BE SEEN WITH ME

15:31.721 --> 15:33.812
- 5% OF THE TIME?
- WHICH IS GREAT!

15:33.813 --> 15:35.184
BECAUSE BEFORE YOU,
MY BEST BOYFRIENDS

15:35.185 --> 15:37.606
WERE LIKE 20-30% EMBARRASSING.

15:37.607 --> 15:40.019
THAT'S 100% NOT HELPING.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.821
JOE, I WAS WRONG TO
TRY TO SNEAK OUT.

15:42.822 --> 15:44.193
PLEASE COME TO THE BALL WITH ME.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.364
NO, FORGET IT.

15:45.365 --> 15:46.615
I'M GOING TO GO TO MY
PITY GAME TONIGHT.

15:46.616 --> 15:47.906
IT'S MUZZLE NIGHT.

15:47.907 --> 15:50.409
FIRST 500 BOYFRIENDS
GET A FREE MOUTH GAG.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.531
IF YOU CHANGE REAL QUICK,
WE CAN GO TOGETHER.

15:52.532 --> 15:53.912
THE POLICEMAN BALL
IS ALWAYS A HOOT.

15:53.913 --> 15:57.126
DRUNK COPS, HANDCUFFS,
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

15:57.127 --> 15:59.578
NO, THANKS, BUT I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS FOR YOU TO BE THERE.

15:59.579 --> 16:00.749
PLUS YOU'LL FIT RIGHT IN....

16:00.750 --> 16:02.041
WITH ALL THE OTHER POLITICIANS

16:02.042 --> 16:03.542
WHO TALK OUT OF BOTH
SIDES OF THEIR MOUTHS.

16:03.543 --> 16:05.134
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

16:05.135 --> 16:07.716
I'M GOING TO MY GAME
WITH MY DIGNITY INTACT.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.719
SO...

16:12.052 --> 16:13.682
( doorbell rings )

16:13.683 --> 16:15.765
IT'S FOR ME, IT'S FOR ME.

16:16.806 --> 16:19.518
IT'S FOR YOU.

16:19.519 --> 16:22.061
OH, ZANDER.

16:22.062 --> 16:24.153
PLEASE, LOOK, YOU CAN'T
GET TO ART SCHOOL

16:24.154 --> 16:25.484
THROUGH MY HOUSE.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.525
I'M ACTUALLY ON MY WAY.

16:26.526 --> 16:28.027
MY DAD WAS DRIVING
ME OUT OF TOWN

16:28.028 --> 16:29.368
BUT I TOLD HIM HE HAD TO STOP.

16:29.369 --> 16:30.699
I'VE GOT TO CONFESS...

16:30.700 --> 16:33.372
I'VE BEEN MILKING THIS LONG
GOODBYE JUST TO SEE YOU.

16:33.373 --> 16:35.704
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

16:35.705 --> 16:36.875
THIS IS IT. I'M
REALLY GOING NOW.

16:36.876 --> 16:38.537
SO... GOODBYE, LENNOX.

16:38.538 --> 16:40.750
OKAY, FINE.

16:48.548 --> 16:50.679
THAT'S IT? NO KISS?

16:50.680 --> 16:52.181
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
WANT HIM TO KISS YOU.

16:52.182 --> 16:53.512
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KISS ME.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.094
BUT I WANTED HIM TO
WANT TO KISS ME.

16:55.095 --> 16:57.056
OBVIOUSLY.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.638
SO ARE YOU EXTRA GIRL WEIRD

16:59.639 --> 17:01.561
OR JUST AVERAGE GIRL WEIRD?

17:07.947 --> 17:09.818
YOU STINK, MOLINA!

17:09.819 --> 17:11.700
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A
CAB TO FIRST BASE?

17:11.701 --> 17:12.861
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY GET THERE.

17:12.862 --> 17:16.325
I'VE SEEN FASTER LEGS
ON AN ARMCHAIR, MOLINA.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.786
- GOOD ONE.
- THANKS, MAN.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.248
- YOU LIKED THAT ONE?
- YEAH.

17:19.249 --> 17:20.919
I GOT THIS GREAT HECKLING
APP ON MY PHONE.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.581
I JUST PLUG IT IN AND
IT KEEPS 'EM COMING.

17:22.582 --> 17:24.083
- IT'S REALLY COOL.
- PARDON ME.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.164
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

17:25.165 --> 17:26.665
SORRY, EXCUSE ME.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.337
HIGH HEELS. DON'T TOUCH
THE MERCHANDISE.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.799
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU
GUYS MAYBE MOVE DOWN?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.971
THANK YOU. UM, HEY!

17:32.972 --> 17:34.473
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

17:34.474 --> 17:35.884
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:35.885 --> 17:37.266
WHY AREN'T YOU AT
YOUR FANCY PARTY?

17:37.267 --> 17:39.178
WELL, THAT REPORTER
FROM "THE HERALD"

17:39.179 --> 17:40.639
ASKED ME, "HOW COME
YOU'RE NOT WITH

17:40.640 --> 17:42.391
YOUR LOUDMOUTHED, OPINIONATED
BOYFRIEND TONIGHT?"

17:42.392 --> 17:45.564
AND I THOUGHT, "YEAH.
HOW COME I'M NOT WITH

17:45.565 --> 17:48.107
MY LOUDMOUTHED, OPINIONATED
BOYFRIEND TONIGHT?"

17:48.108 --> 17:51.150
SO HERE I AM.

17:51.151 --> 17:53.492
THAT WAS VERY CLOSE TO SWEET.

17:53.493 --> 17:56.034
I TRY. AND I'LL
BE TRYING HARDER.

17:56.035 --> 17:57.576
WHEN YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD THAT
YOU'LL KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT,

17:57.577 --> 18:00.699
- I SHOULD TRUST YOU.
- YOU REALLY SHOULD TRUST ME ON THAT.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.751
AT LEAST 95% OF THE TIME.

18:02.752 --> 18:04.794
- THAT'S A SUPER-HIGH NUMBER.
- IT REALLY IS.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.378
WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING TO THE GAME

18:09.379 --> 18:11.710
AND DITCHING THE
POLICEMAN'S BALL.

18:11.711 --> 18:13.172
YOU KNOW WHAT HURT THE MOST?

18:13.173 --> 18:14.713
LEAVING BEFORE THEY
GAVE OUT THE SWAG.

18:14.714 --> 18:16.135
POLICEMEN HAVE THE BEST STUFF.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.177
LAST YEAR THEY GAVE OUT
BREATHALYZER KEY CHAINS.

18:18.178 --> 18:20.269
USE IT EVERY DAY.

18:20.270 --> 18:22.561
OH... GO GO. GO GO GO GO GO!

18:22.562 --> 18:24.603
AH...

18:24.604 --> 18:26.685
WOW, WHAT A CATCH!

18:26.686 --> 18:28.066
YEAH, BY THE CYCLONES.

18:28.067 --> 18:30.489
WELL, YEAH, BUT DID YOU SEE
HOW HIGH THAT GUY JUMPED?

18:30.490 --> 18:32.110
WAY TO GO, CYCLONES!

18:32.111 --> 18:33.402
- HEY.
- YEAH!

18:33.403 --> 18:34.733
MEL, MIGHT WANT TO TAKE
IT DOWN A NOTCH, OKAY?

18:34.734 --> 18:37.075
YEAH, THIS IS MUD
HENS TERRITORY, LADY.

18:37.076 --> 18:38.697
YEAH, BUT I THINK
EVEN A MUD HENS FAN

18:38.698 --> 18:40.038
COULD APPRECIATE A GOOD PLAY.

18:40.039 --> 18:42.541
- AM I RIGHT?
- ( all groan, mutter )

18:42.542 --> 18:44.293
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
HEY HEY HEY!

18:44.294 --> 18:45.504
CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT? LOOK...

18:45.505 --> 18:46.795
SHE'S NEW HERE, ALL RIGHT?

18:46.796 --> 18:48.587
CLEARLY SHE'S NOT AS
BIG A FAN AS WE ARE.

18:48.588 --> 18:50.048
SHE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW
HOW THESE GAMES WORK.

18:50.049 --> 18:51.550
DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO TALK
AND WHEN TO SHUT UP.

18:51.551 --> 18:53.462
BUT I PROMISE YOU... GIVE
HER A SECOND CHANCE,

18:53.463 --> 18:54.963
SHE'LL DO THE RIGHT THING.
SO COME ON.

18:54.964 --> 18:57.556
CAN WE NOT SHOW OUR GUEST HERE
A LITTLE MUD HEN HOSPITALITY?

18:57.557 --> 18:59.809
CAN WE, HUH?

19:02.472 --> 19:04.142
APPARENTLY WE CAN'T.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.684
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

19:05.685 --> 19:07.856
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BEER.

19:07.857 --> 19:10.109
DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.275
OOH OOH, WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

19:16.276 --> 19:18.156
- ( TV playing )
- Joe: LOOK AT THAT.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.448
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

19:19.449 --> 19:21.540
THAT'S A TEEN ROMANCE IN
FULL BLOSSOM RIGHT THERE.

19:21.541 --> 19:24.082
THAT'S ANOTHER LONGO
INSTITUTE SUCCESS STORY.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.124
- THE LONGO WHAT?
- NOTHING.

19:26.125 --> 19:28.547
SO SHOULD WE GIVE THE
KIDS THEIR PRIVACY?

19:28.548 --> 19:30.459
NO WAY! IT'S MY HOUSE.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.090
ARE YOU SURE...

19:32.091 --> 19:33.792
WHAT THE HELL?

19:33.793 --> 19:35.133
THAT'S A FRICKIN' BABY.

19:35.134 --> 19:37.005
I CAN SEE IT'S A BABY.
GET IN THERE.

19:37.006 --> 19:40.429
- OH, HEY, GUYS.
- HEY!

19:40.430 --> 19:41.930
( chuckles ) SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.472
HEY, RYDER. WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:43.473 --> 19:44.603
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S UP?

19:44.604 --> 19:45.565
WE'RE JUST WATCHING A MOVIE.

19:45.566 --> 19:47.306
OH, I GET IT.

19:47.307 --> 19:48.647
LOOK AT THIS INDUSTRIOUS
YOUNG LADY.

19:48.648 --> 19:50.609
BABYSITTING WHILE ON A DATE.

19:50.610 --> 19:52.271
OH, YEAH. I AM A
FULL-TIME BABYSITTER.

19:52.272 --> 19:54.573
THIS IS STELLA'S
DAUGHTER, ISABEL.

19:54.574 --> 19:55.944
DID YOU HEAR THAT? IT'S
HER DAUGHTER, ISABEL.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.816
YES, I HEARD. IT'S HER
DAUGHTER, ISABEL.

19:57.817 --> 19:59.528
UH-HUH. UH, RYDER...

19:59.529 --> 20:01.740
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT...

20:01.741 --> 20:03.161
SHE HAD A LOT GOING ON.

20:03.162 --> 20:05.914
YEAH, JOE, YOU WERE
TOTALLY RIGHT.

20:05.915 --> 20:09.207
WE CAN ABSOLUTELY MAKE
THIS WORK IF WE WANT TO.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.959
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.421
I'M KIND OF TRYING
TO HAVE A DATE HERE.

20:12.422 --> 20:13.712
- OH.
- OH, IT'S OKAY, RYDER.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.634
ISABEL HAS TO HAVE
HER DINNER FIRST.

20:15.635 --> 20:16.635
Joe: OH...

20:16.636 --> 20:19.928
OH, MY GOSH. SHE JUST
STARTED BREASTFEEDING.

20:19.929 --> 20:21.470
IT'S OKAY, JOE.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.931
IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL.

20:22.932 --> 20:24.182
WELL, MAYBE IT IS TIME TO GO.

20:24.183 --> 20:25.805
ME FIRST!

20:30.730 --> 20:32.020
HOW COULD YOU ENCOURAGE THIS?

20:32.021 --> 20:33.111
I DIDN'T ENCOURAGE THIS.

20:33.112 --> 20:34.563
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAD A BABY.

20:34.564 --> 20:35.654
WHEN RYDER SAID SHE
HAD A LOT GOING ON,

20:35.655 --> 20:37.946
I THOUGHT HE MEANT SPANISH
CLUB AND YEARBOOK.

20:37.947 --> 20:40.659
NOT MOMMY AND ME
AND BREASTFEEDING.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.821
THIS COULD TOTALLY
RUIN RYDER'S FUTURE.

20:42.822 --> 20:44.363
HE'S ALREADY GETTING
A "C" IN ALGEBRA

20:44.364 --> 20:45.954
WITHOUT A BABY IN HIS LIFE.

20:45.955 --> 20:47.666
WITH A BABY, WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND
OF TERRIBLE THINGS COULD HAPPEN?

20:47.667 --> 20:50.289
MAYBE HE'LL GET A BETTER
GRADE IN BIOLOGY.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.501
- HEY.
- HEY, STELLA.

20:52.502 --> 20:53.792
I HAD SOME EXTRA MILK.

20:53.793 --> 20:55.504
IS IT COOL IF I PUT IT IN
THE FRIDGE FOR NEXT TIME?

20:55.505 --> 20:56.755
YEAH, OF COURSE.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.176
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM IN MY FRIDGE

20:58.177 --> 20:59.838
FOR TEEN MOM MILK.

20:59.839 --> 21:01.430
I AM TOTALLY COOL WITH THIS.

21:01.431 --> 21:03.302
JUST DON'T PUT IT NEXT TO THE
HALF AND HALF, ALL RIGHT?

21:03.303 --> 21:04.593
I DON'T WANT TO
MAKE ANY MISTAKES

21:04.594 --> 21:05.884
WHEN I'M MAKING MY
COFFEE IN THE MORNING.

21:05.885 --> 21:07.686
GOT IT. OH, AND THANKS AGAIN

21:07.687 --> 21:09.018
FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.

21:12.392 --> 21:13.692
( sighs )

21:13.693 --> 21:14.943
SHE SEEMS PRETTY SWEET.

21:14.944 --> 21:16.315
MAYBE THIS WOULD BE OKAY.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.856
OKAY? REALLY?

21:17.857 --> 21:19.698
RYDER DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO TIE HIS SHOES

21:19.699 --> 21:20.989
TILL HE WAS 15.

21:20.990 --> 21:22.451
HOW'S HE GOING TO
HANDLE A RELATIONSHIP

21:22.452 --> 21:23.532
WITH A GIRL WHO HAS A KID?

21:23.533 --> 21:25.744
HOLY CRAP!

21:25.745 --> 21:28.707
RYDER HAS A BABY BEFORE I DO.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.750
NOT THAT IT'S A COMPETITION.
