WOMAN: You have now come
to the end of your second semester.

01:07.943 --> 01:11.094
Some of you will remain here
to complete your education.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.722
Some of you will go out into the world.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.641
And, as is my custom,

01:15.701 --> 01:19.686
I put to you a question
of the utmost importance,

01:19.746 --> 01:22.739
which concerns your spiritual wellbeing.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.994
Do you wish to come to God and be saved?

01:30.257 --> 01:34.672
Those of you who wish to be Christian
and saved will move to my right.

01:43.145 --> 01:47.014
To those of you who remain
and hope to be saved...

01:48.233 --> 01:49.940
you will move to my left.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.188
Have you said your prayers?

02:03.248 --> 02:04.940
Yes.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.526
Though it can't make much
difference to the Creator.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.152
Do I understand you correctly?

02:10.213 --> 02:14.700
Do you believe that your Creator is
indifferent to your sins?

02:14.760 --> 02:17.218
That, in His mercy, He sees you slumber?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.759
No, you misunderstand me.
I've not got so far.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.876
I am not even awakened yet.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.296
And how should I repent?

02:27.356 --> 02:29.923
I am somewhat troubled, to be sure,

02:29.983 --> 02:32.134
but my feelings are all indefinite.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.845
The question is not
how far you have advanced,

02:34.905 --> 02:37.055
but how far you ought to have advanced.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.224
Not how you feel, but how you ought to feel.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.852
I don't feel anything.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.950
I have no sense of my sins. And how can I?

02:46.792 --> 02:51.570
I wish I could feel as others do,
but it is not possible.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.907
A sinner against a Holy God
and under condemnation,

02:55.967 --> 03:01.163
and liable every moment to drop
into a burning hopeless eternity,

03:01.223 --> 03:04.124
yet cannot feel, cannot be alarmed,

03:04.184 --> 03:06.892
cannot "flee from the wrath to come".

03:08.522 --> 03:10.559
And the true question is...

03:11.692 --> 03:14.435
Are you in the Ark of Safety?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.654
I fear I am not.

03:19.533 --> 03:23.618
You are alone in your rebellion,

too fatiguing for her.

- An acute case of evangelism.

I do not like to see a woman upon the stage.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.896
But she has a gift.

06:12.956 --> 06:17.484
A gift is no excuse for a female
to exhibit herself in that way.

And what would you have her do?
Perform an act of congress aloud?

06:22.841 --> 06:25.200
That would depend upon what key it was in.

- Of course.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.895
As you may know, I like to write.

I was nearly kept waiting.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.806
And what is your opinion of my poem, Emily?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.768
I'm sure your verse is equal
to your talent, Aunt.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.730
If I were clever enough, I should probably
take offence at that dubious compliment.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.901
Oh, but, Aunt, all the best compliments
are dubious.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.294
That's part of their charm.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.908
Did you enjoy my verses, Austin?

10:34.968 --> 10:39.053
Very much, Aunt.
They put Paradise Lost to shame.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.291
Your children are far too sophisticated,
Edward.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.460
I'm sure part of me disapproves.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.254
- Disapproval is a heavy thing.
- Oh.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.633
Besides, if I had to choose between
having sophisticated children

10:51.693 --> 10:53.760
and ones that were merely docile,

10:53.820 --> 10:56.471
I should choose the former.

10:56.531 --> 11:00.600
- Docility is too much like slavery.
- That sounds like abolitionist talk.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.187
No, it is not. But no Christian
could ever make a case for slavery.

Yes.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.606
In the Springfield Republican.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.015
It... it was printed anonymously.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.317

probably a good thing.

for the eternity which surrounds us all.

Here, Aunt.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.889
AUNT ELIZABETH: And what of you?

12:20.949 --> 12:25.852
Oh, I am like Pilgrim, trying to improve.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.606
A pilgrim should only ever be conscious
of other people's self-improvement.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.483
Consciousness of his own is mere vanity.

12:32.543 --> 12:37.113
But, Aunt, vanity is such a harmless vice.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.240
It's as shallow as
the people who indulge in it.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.910
No vice is harmless, Vinnie.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.508
Look no further than Babylon for that.

- Oh, I'm on no pilgrimage at all.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.253

12:52.313 --> 12:55.590

Oh, I prefer to listen and remain silent.

13:03.366 --> 13:07.310
That way, a prejudice
doesn't seem like an opinion.

I'm none the wiser.

- Yes, I thought it had a military ring to it.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.048
But that was years ago.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.342

ecclesiastical history.

the same educational advantages as men.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.825

A unique combination of both.

already given Himself to me.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.701
he will think he has married
one of the minor Borgias.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.548
(CHUCKLES)

37:47.515 --> 37:48.881
Will you marry?

37:49.642 --> 37:51.759
I only want my family.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.881
It is not perfect.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.933
It is not Paradise.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.362
But it is far better
than anything I could know.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.565
Or want.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.286
When you do marry...

38:16.669 --> 38:19.537
- I shall miss you.
- Of course you shall miss me.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.490
I refuse to be forgotten.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.507
(LAUGHS)

38:25.261 --> 38:27.120
VINNIE: Emily.

38:27.180 --> 38:30.457
Make sure your bread is ready
for the agricultural fair tomorrow.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.804
Yes. I haven't forgotten.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.896
They feel swollen.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.734
They are swollen, like my feet.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.358
Oh!

(EMILY GASPS)

39:12.308 --> 39:13.917
Miss Emily?

39:13.977 --> 39:16.890
Will you please get my bread out of the oven?

39:22.402 --> 39:24.359
It doesn't need all three of you
to pick it up!

39:32.662 --> 39:36.952
I believe you spoke sharply to Thomas,
Margaret and Maggie yesterday.

39:38.084 --> 39:42.070
- Yes, Father.
- They must be treated with respect.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.543
They are not servants, but employees.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.837
What was that for?

39:58.897 --> 40:02.811
For pointing out so eloquently
the distinction between the two.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.145
I was very impolite yesterday.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.491
I would like to apologise
to all three of you.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.145
Er, no offence taken.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.399
Then may I take it that I am forgiven?

40:19.459 --> 40:22.293
For I am truly sorry.

40:23.796 --> 40:25.738
But we have good news, miss.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.741
Your bread won five dollars.

40:28.801 --> 40:32.787
Then you must keep the money.
It will ease my conscience.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.214
MARGARET: It took second prize.

40:36.309 --> 40:39.848
Oh. Second prize.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.186
What does it feel like to be a father,
Austin?

40:46.152 --> 40:47.313
Fatherly.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.697
May I hold him?

40:56.496 --> 40:58.533
(BABY GURGLES)

41:09.968 --> 41:12.881
- We're calling him Edward.
- Ned, for short.

41:13.763 --> 41:16.506
I'm nobody! Who are you?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.346
Are you nobody, too?

41:21.396 --> 41:25.173
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!

41:25.233 --> 41:27.467
They'd banish us, you know.

41:27.527 --> 41:30.845
How dreary to be somebody!

41:30.905 --> 41:34.515
How public, like a frog

41:34.575 --> 41:37.018
To tell one's name the livelong day

41:37.078 --> 41:38.910
To an admiring bog!

41:43.084 --> 41:45.201
AUSTIN: Father? What is it?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.533
Fort Sumter has been fired upon.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.585
What does this mean?

41:55.513 --> 41:59.006
It is thought that
the South will secede from the Union.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.043
Then it means civil war.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.671
Does this mean you will be drafted, Austin?

42:04.731 --> 42:06.518
Almost certainly.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.301
You will remain here.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.637
But, Father, my friends will fight.
I cannot stay at home.

42:12.697 --> 42:17.141
I will pay the $500 bond so that
a substitute may fight in your place.

42:17.201 --> 42:22.021
- What about my honour, sir?
- Your honour, sir, will be safe in my hands.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.023
And my conscience, Father? What of that?

42:24.083 --> 42:28.903
It will be best if your conscience
found solace in you doing your filial duty.

42:28.963 --> 42:33.616
For those who will die in this civil war,
"filial duty" will seem like cowardice.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.743
No young man of breeding
would make such a remark.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.965
No gentleman would provoke it!

42:40.641 --> 42:42.598

You are my only son.

I cannot see your life put at risk.

42:51.110 --> 42:54.762
Please, Father, don't make me stay.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.906
You are not to go! I forbid it!

43:01.704 --> 43:03.491

43:04.707 --> 43:06.744
I will remain here.

But gallanter, I know

For such, the Angels go -

And Uniforms of snow.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.632

44:05.184 --> 44:08.848
EMILY: There is a word which bears a sword

44:09.814 --> 44:12.465
Can pierce an armed man.

44:12.525 --> 44:17.361
It hurls its barbed syllables, -
And once is mute again.

But where it fell, the saved will tell

44:21.284 --> 44:23.893
On patriotic day,

Some epauletted brother gave his breath away

Wherever runs the breathless sun,
Wherever roams the day,

There is its noiseless onset,

44:38.217 --> 44:40.174
There its victory!

44:45.600 --> 44:48.668
AUSTIN: We went to Gettysburg
to hear the speeches.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.671
Mr Edward Everett spoke for nearly two hours.

44:51.731 --> 44:54.465
- SUSAN: Very rousing.
- EMILY: And the President's speech?

44:54.525 --> 44:56.676
AUSTIN: Mr Lincoln
was shocking in his brevity.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.886
He spoke for about three minutes.
Not memorable.

44:58.946 --> 45:01.180
VINNIE: Were there many there
to hear the orations?

45:01.240 --> 45:04.934
- SUSAN: Some said fifteen thousand.
- (EMILY SIGHS DEEPLY)

45:04.994 --> 45:08.729
AUSTIN: Most of them looking for breakfast,
or trying to find souvenirs of the battle.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.746
Macabre.

45:13.002 --> 45:16.612
They say that over
six hundred thousand men have perished.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.823
And for what?

45:18.883 --> 45:23.411
To end slavery, which should never have
flourished in this country in the first place.

45:23.471 --> 45:26.205
Miss Buffam has had
too great an influence over you, Emily.

45:26.265 --> 45:29.709
If more men were as outspoken as
Miss Buffam, we may not have had a war.

45:29.769 --> 45:35.006
How dare you trivialise it in that way?
The conflict was not about gender.

45:35.066 --> 45:39.093
Any argument about gender is war,
because that, too, is slavery.

45:39.153 --> 45:43.014
- That's a contemptible thing to say.
- Live as a woman for a week, Austin.

45:43.074 --> 45:45.908
You will find it neither congenial nor trivial.

45:57.129 --> 45:59.542
So you leave tomorrow?

46:01.884 --> 46:03.993
How long will you be gone?

46:04.053 --> 46:05.965
Two months, maybe.

46:07.098 --> 46:11.709
Both cases are difficult,

A man must make his way in the world.
He can't be merely decorous.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.823
And a woman? What should she do?

46:27.952 --> 46:30.269
Or is she destined only for decorousness?

- Let's not argue.

No husband would.

I came over.

47:41.233 --> 47:44.510
- I thought something was amiss.
- No.

It is the best time,

as if the whole world is asleep and still.

Why did you take so long
to consent to marry Austin?

48:08.761 --> 48:10.798
In truth...

48:14.100 --> 48:17.013
the thought of men in
that particular respect...

48:19.855 --> 48:22.017
turned me to stone.

Although Austin is...

48:32.701 --> 48:35.353
very tender...

48:35.413 --> 48:37.450
and yielding to my...

48:40.751 --> 48:42.693

48:42.753 --> 48:47.544
Is that particular part of married life
so terrible?

I do my duty.

We will be sisters.

But you have a life.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.226
I have a routine.

49:49.236 --> 49:52.320
It is God's one concession to a no-hoper.

49:53.157 --> 49:55.149
Does nothing give you solace?

50:04.251 --> 50:06.994
For those of us who live minor lives,

50:08.005 --> 50:10.213
and are deprived of...

50:14.094 --> 50:16.177
a particular kind of love,

50:18.474 --> 50:20.511
we know best how to starve.

50:29.693 --> 50:33.562
We deceive ourselves, and then others.

50:39.245 --> 50:41.737
It is the worst kind of lie.

50:58.138 --> 51:00.551
But in matters of the soul...

51:03.310 --> 51:05.097
you are rigorous.

51:07.314 --> 51:10.352
Rigour is no substitute for happiness.

51:14.947 --> 51:18.140
PASTOR: Oh, what a call is this?

51:18.200 --> 51:23.354
The dear ones, whose names are written
in the Lamb's Book of Life,

51:23.414 --> 51:27.024
cry "Come, come!"

51:27.084 --> 51:32.455
And the church below, Christ's witness
unto the world and the church above,

51:33.048 --> 51:35.115
with the rustling of the white robes,

51:35.175 --> 51:37.743
and the sweeping of the golden harps,

51:37.803 --> 51:40.887
cries "Come, come!"

51:42.016 --> 51:48.638
And the angels of Heaven, lo! Rank
above rank, immortal principalities,

51:49.732 --> 51:52.675
as they circle the eternal throne.

51:52.735 --> 52:00.609
They have caught up the sound,
and cry "Come, come!"

52:02.578 --> 52:06.272
Reverend Wadsworth's sermons
take the breath away!

52:06.332 --> 52:09.525
That kind of religious ecstasy is wonderful,

52:09.585 --> 52:11.735
but back in the quiet of one's own room,

52:11.795 --> 52:14.238
it seems as remote as Spitsbergen.

52:14.298 --> 52:17.908
Still, he is as handsome as he is ecstatic.

52:17.968 --> 52:21.704
And he is so clean.
Like a cherub after bathing.

(SIGHS) Ah, to be betrothed
without the swoon.

52:29.730 --> 52:31.505
But a person may hope.

If you're too quick to hope,
you'll always be disappointed.

52:35.027 --> 52:38.804
And if I am too quick to despair, what then?

52:38.864 --> 52:40.730
Then you will be too slow to hope.

52:41.950 --> 52:45.068
I set too much store by friendships.

52:46.080 --> 52:50.495
When we lose friends to death,
that is the most profound loss.

52:51.543 --> 52:57.039
When we lose them to marriage, the grief
is subtler, but just as keenly felt.

53:00.636 --> 53:05.623
We cannot keep the world, or life,
at bay, Emily. Neither can we ignore it.

53:05.683 --> 53:10.085
We can do better than that.
We can be vigilant against it.

53:10.145 --> 53:12.307
But when that vigil is over, what then?

53:13.982 --> 53:17.843
Eternity. And in that place, no loss is felt.

53:17.903 --> 53:20.012
But what of the kingdom to come?

53:20.072 --> 53:24.783
That may be a gain, but only after the fact.

One day, you may marry.

54:25.512 --> 54:28.455
No, thank you. Mrs Wadsworth is an abstainer.

54:28.515 --> 54:31.083
I thought abstention was only for alcohol.

54:31.143 --> 54:33.510
For me, it extends to tea, also.

54:37.941 --> 54:42.594
They say the Chinese drink tea
for remedial purposes.

54:42.654 --> 54:45.772
I'm glad to say that I'm not Chinese.

54:50.621 --> 54:52.896
Some lemonade, then?

54:52.956 --> 54:55.190
Surely God would not disapprove of lemonade?

54:55.250 --> 55:01.042
Levity and the will of God are, I think,
incompatible. Almost improper.

I'm sorry I was cruel.
But, madam, I must say in truth,

56:18.709 --> 56:23.295
Hiawatha is but gruel.
Read just one stanza for the proof.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.033
No.

56:28.093 --> 56:32.337
Give me something pressed
from truth, and that is poetry.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.833
I suppose you feel the BrontÃ«s do that?

56:35.893 --> 56:38.794
Yes. And a few others.

56:38.854 --> 56:42.222
MRS WADSWORTH:
What do you find in all that Yorkshire gloom?

56:43.275 --> 56:47.594
The beauty of truth. The poetry of the known.

56:47.654 --> 56:49.805
But why can't they dwell
on something wholesome?

56:49.865 --> 56:54.030
If they wished to be wholesome,
I would imagine they would crochet.

57:00.751 --> 57:03.619
Would you like to take a turn in our garden?

57:05.505 --> 57:07.990
No, thank you.

57:08.050 --> 57:09.992
I find this heat oppressive.

57:10.052 --> 57:12.544
But Charles loves to be out of doors.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.998
I myself prefer the shade.

57:16.058 --> 57:19.042
In that case, I will take the liberty

57:19.102 --> 57:22.129
of escorting your husband
around our modest garden.

57:22.189 --> 57:25.648
And my sister can have you all to herself.

57:44.544 --> 57:46.285
More water?

57:48.006 --> 57:50.749
Thank you for your invitation,
Miss Dickinson.

57:52.344 --> 57:58.261
I was very moved by your sermon, sir,
and wanted very much to tell you.

58:07.192 --> 58:11.607
This is all I have to give in return.

59:16.386 --> 59:19.162
Please say something.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.839
Does my poetry have any worth?

59:25.812 --> 59:28.130
They are remarkable.

59:28.190 --> 59:32.605
Uncompromising, yes,
but this is wonderful poetry.

59:33.945 --> 59:36.054
How many have been published?

59:36.114 --> 59:38.432
Seven.

59:38.492 --> 59:40.233
Eleven?

59:41.328 --> 59:43.020
I cannot recall.

59:43.080 --> 59:46.565
- And no more?
- And no more.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.608
How can you be so stoic?

59:48.668 --> 59:52.082
It's easy to be stoic when no one
wants what you have to offer.

59:54.216 --> 59:57.084
There is, I suppose, always posterity.

59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.175
But posterity is as comfortless as God.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.041
That sounds like despair.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.138
No, it's bitterness.

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:09.087
Besides...

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:12.299
a posthumous reputation
is only for those who, when living,

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.316
weren't worth remembering.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.858
Still... Ah!

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.695
To be racked by success!

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.078
But I would like some approval before I die.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:36.698
EMILY: If you were coming in the fall,
I'd brush the summer by

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:41.173
With half a smile and half a spurn,
As housewives do a fly.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:47.042
If I could see you in a year,
I'd wind the months in balls,

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:51.472
And put them each in separate drawers,
Until their time befalls.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:57.177
If only centuries delayed,
I'd count them on my hand,

01:00:57.237 --> 01:01:02.224
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemen's land.

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:08.326
If certain, when this life was out,
That yours and mine should be,

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:14.912
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
And taste eternity.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:23.591
But now, all ignorant of the length
Of time's uncertain wing,

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:31.353
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
That will not state its sting.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.259
I must have someone with a sense of humour,

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:39.761
someone who can laugh at the world.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:43.890
Taking life seriously
is the shortest route to disaster.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.017
And have you found such a one?

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.478
Someone has found me.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.149
A Mr Wilder, a Professor of Mathematics.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:56.670
And if he can find comedy
in a vulgar fraction, I'm his.

01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:01.783
- But do you love him?
- Love? I cannot say.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:05.962
It's a very beguiling idea.
They even say it exists.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.507
But how will you know?

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.088
What if you make an error?

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:18.425
If he is a bad choice,
I'll have him killed quietly

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:22.775
and tell everyone he died of some sort
of algebraic shock. (CHUCKLES)

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.016
I hope you will be happy.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:31.104
That cannot be guaranteed.
I'll settle for consideration.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:35.233
- That sounds like surrender.
- No, it's practicality.

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:39.654
And who knows?
Perhaps love will come in its wake.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:44.201
- Then I can relax into smugness.
- You could never be smug.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:49.414
Life catches you out, Emily. In the end,
we all become the thing we most dread.

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:53.293
Then I will reject the world
and not fulfil that prophecy.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:56.213
Then you will be making
the greatest of mistakes,

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:59.812
for you will deny yourself
what your spirit needs most.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:05.347
- And what is that?
- Truth. And experience.

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:08.099
Otherwise,
your vow will be an act of cowardice.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:11.778
- That was hurtful.
- But honest.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:18.026
Don't resist your vices, Emily.
It is your virtues you should be wary of.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:22.781
Austin once told Aunt Elizabeth
that our virtues are just vices in disguise.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:24.824
Now, there is a man with a sense of humour.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:27.251
And does your Mr Wilder possess one?

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:31.081
Of a kind. He proposed to me by letter,

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.976
so if the marriage is unhappy,
I shall blame the US mail.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.505
Always conform.

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:41.633
Keep disobedience secret.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:46.805
Be outwardly docile, but in your heart,
you can be as revolutionary as you like.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.683
- But isn't that hypocrisy?
- Of course it is.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:52.227
But in America, we cherish it.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.854
We think it makes us incorruptible.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:58.858
You must never confuse
the outer with the inner piety.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.486
Only Episcopalians do that.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:06.408
But I am rebellious
and far from the grace of God.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.835
You are closer to Him than anyone I know.

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:16.126
Always look below the surface, Emily,
but don't be afraid of what you find there.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.894
- Chaos?
- Yes.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:25.719
Then I shall confront everything.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:29.639
Don't be too radical, Emily.
Radicals don't thrive in this country.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.351
- But you are a radical.
- But I'll eventually conform.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.324
For the sake of peace or a quiet life.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.917
But I know that you will not,
and I envy you your courage.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:49.709
I suppose you shall carry lovely flowers

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:53.258
and have Mr Mendelssohn's "Wedding March".

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:58.168
Flowers, yes. Mendelssohn, no.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:02.130
Never play happy music at a wedding,
Emily, it's too misleading.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:06.259
- But you shall be forever gone from us.
- You make it sound like dying.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.511
- Isn't it?
- No.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:12.110
And even if it were, you must
force yourself to think otherwise.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:15.143
America is the only country in the world

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:18.116
that looks upon death
as some kind of personal failure.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.864
May I get you something, Mother?

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.961
No, Emily. (SIGHS)

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:36.089
You've always seemed so sad, Mother.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:42.428
My life has passed as if in a dream.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.558
As if I'd never been part of it.

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:54.140
After Vinnie was born,

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.912
a kind of melancholia settled over me
which I mistook for contentment.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.080
Were we such a terrible price to pay?

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.537
No!

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:12.254
I wouldn't be without all three of you.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.716
To have my children about me...

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.208
there could be no better medicine.

Reverend Wadsworth
has sailed for San Francisco.

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:39.504
They all go. They all leave.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:41.915
They all desert you.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:44.467
Do not touch me!

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:49.255
I will not be pitied.
It makes me feel repulsive.

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:51.841
You set too much store
by physical beauty, Emily.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:56.095
The only people who can be sanguine
about not being handsome

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.442
are those who are beautiful already.

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:02.143
The rest of us have only our envy
to keep us warm.

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:06.105

- What's the use of that in this world?

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.983
I sometimes think
you are too harsh with yourself.

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:12.695
I have many defects.
There is much to rectify!

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.156
It is just as punitive
to admit to too many faults

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:17.617
as it is to deny too few virtues.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:20.215
The Reverend Wadsworth is a married man.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:27.054
This kind of attachment is improper.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:32.506
We can't all possess your smug rectitude.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:33.925
Don't sneer at anyone's morals

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:35.969
when your own could do with
some little correction.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:38.429
By that, I assume
you mean Reverend Wadsworth?

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.265
He's married!

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:41.765
You should not attach yourself

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:45.144
to someone who is not free
to return that attachment!

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:48.162
You hardly know the man,
except through his sermons.

Besides, he and Mrs Wadsworth are very happy.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:56.197
She has led a blameless life.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:09:00.868
She hasn't led a life at all!
She's too inert for that.

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:04.788
If docility were love,
we would all live happily ever after.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:07.542
She's a good wife!

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:11.712
And, to be truthful, I have never understood
the attraction of her husband for you.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:15.858
He is hardly a Mr Rochester,
and you are certainly not Jane Eyre!

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.657
That was unkind.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.314
I'm sorry, too.

Emily?

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.823
You must eat.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.122
You must come down now.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.953
It's been three days.

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:35.336
You are wearing white.

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.998
Yes.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:41.971
But we're still in mourning.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:45.930
So am I.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:53.554
Emily? It's Mr Bowles.

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:56.527
He's come to Amherst specially to see you.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.444
Well, come down, damn you.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.588
I refuse to speak to someone
who's a flight of stairs above me.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:15.326
Forgive me, sir, if I'm frightened.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:18.204
I never see anyone
and I hardly know what to say.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:22.083
You could say thank you
for my publishing some of your verse.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:25.836
For that, sir, you have more than
my thanks. You have my gratitude.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.138
But, sir...

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.510
you have altered some of my punctuation.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:36.639
Good Lord. What's a hyphen here
or a semi-colon there?

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.683
To many, nothing.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:43.187
But, to me, the alteration of my
punctuation marks is very hard to endure.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:45.940
Then I apologise.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.568
I was merely trying to make
your meaning clearer to my readers.

01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:53.713
Clarity is one thing, sir,
obviousness quite another.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:59.745
The only person qualified to interfere
with the poet's work is the poet herself.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:02.123
From anyone else, it feels like an attack.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:06.293
Miss Dickinson,
this is no way to speak or behave.

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:10.563
If you treated a suitor like this,
he would not return.

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:15.269
- Are you sure there will be one?
- Of course.

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:18.901
Even for someone
as hard to please as yourself.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.560
Well, if he does come,

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:27.231
he will have to be as spectacular
as Disraeli and as sincere as Gladstone.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.624
And as upright as George Washington?

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:34.413

Our beautiful friend?

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:30.010
- Will you come down?
- No.

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:34.215
This is discourteous.
Why will you not come down and meet him?

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:38.177
Because he is so beautiful,
and I am not beautiful enough.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.347
He's read some of your published poems
and admires them.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.808
Admiration always masks envy.

01:17:43.868 --> 01:17:45.768
What does envy mask?

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:48.696
Oh, that masks admiration.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.783
He may come to the foot of the stairs.

01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:56.586
- Miss Dickinson?
- EMILY: Yes.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:01.425
- I cannot see you.
- That, sir, is no matter.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:07.264
(CHUCKLES) It is the first time
I've conducted a visit in this fashion.

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:13.587
It seems unfair that you can see me
but I can only hear you.

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:18.312
That can be no hardship, sir,
for I am best heard and not seen.

01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:22.304
Er... Will you take a ride
with Vinnie and me?

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:26.684
I do not cross my father's ground
to any house or town.

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:29.687
That seems such a shame,
especially in such lovely weather.

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:33.866
The weather will remain lovely
whether I drive through it or not.

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:38.958
Then I wish you good day, Miss Dickinson.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:40.922
Good day, Mr Emmons.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:48.471

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:06.648
But I will wait all my days

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:12.909

# My heart had never known you

# Shall we begin to wrangle?

# No, no, no, my heart is fast

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:24.231
# And cannot disentangle

Oh, Emily, you should have come -
it was radiant.

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:22.688
Yes. And I'm sure you would have
made it even more radiant, Miss Emily.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:27.151
Ridicule is not the way to
any woman's heart, sir. Least of all mine.

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:28.861
MR EMMONS: It was meant sincerely.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:31.405
Or should I judge beauty
by the common standard?

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:36.827
Any standard may be common.
Familiarity, as they say, breeds contempt.

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:39.663
Perhaps contempt breeds familiarity.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:42.458
At any rate,
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:47.764
That is no longer true, sir.
For that truism has become a clichÃ©.

01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.759
Miss Dickinson,
you are just a little too sharp.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:55.888
And you, sir, are a little too quick
to play the martyr.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:58.531
Then I'll take my leave
before any blood is spilt.

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.201
There are wounds which do not bleed,

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.907
but which aggrieve nonetheless.

01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:13.588
I just assumed that you wanted
to be rid of me. I meant no injury.

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:18.878
Nor did I, sir. I only wish to be honest.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.876
May I call again?

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:29.755
If it gives you no pleasure,
what is the point?

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:32.424
I had hoped that my company
wouldn't be a burden.

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:35.602
A burden can always be laid down, sir.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.238
You are not required to be another Sisyphus.

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:48.899
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:52.418
Oh, Emily, why do you behave like this?

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:57.241
He is a kind man and he was hurt.

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:59.418
I don't know.

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:03.838
As soon as they get too close,
I feel as if I'm suffocating.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:08.802
I long for... something.

01:25:10.814 --> 01:25:13.423
But I am afraid of it.

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:18.178
A man may love and then cool,
but it is not that way with me.

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:20.514
But you cannot be equal to a man.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:23.692
If I cannot have equality,
then I want nothing of love.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:27.312
I will not be so confined
that I cannot breathe.

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:31.149
But a rebellious spirit
invites only retribution.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:34.236
Then I will be silent in my rebellion,

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:36.780
so that no one will know
what my true feelings are.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.951
- God will know.
- But I will not be married to God.

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:44.129
But you are His possession
and answerable to Him.

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:49.304
He will know of my struggle and be merciful.

01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:53.975
And if He does not exist,

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:57.608
then I will be eternally free.

Well, thank you. She's taking tea with Mabel.

01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:31.544
Ah, Mrs Todd. And her dull narcissism.

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:36.007
You mistake confidence for narcissism,
and womanly reticence for dullness.

01:42:36.067 --> 01:42:38.259
Whatever else can be said of Mrs Todd,

01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:40.970
no one could ever accuse her of reticence.

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:43.431
Or does one only require reticence in a wife?

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:46.700
- My wife is perfectly happy.
- Yes, of course.

01:42:47.745 --> 01:42:51.314
I'm sure she sees infidelity,
when accompanied by Schubert,

01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:53.316
as a delightful pastime.

01:42:53.376 --> 01:42:54.984
A kind of musical adultery.

01:42:55.044 --> 01:42:57.862
Real artists cannot be confined
by narrow convention.

01:42:57.922 --> 01:43:01.824
Real artists don't deceive themselves

When you have any public to speak of,

01:43:03.636 --> 01:43:06.787
I'm sure your reputation
will no doubt be very secure.

In all this, Susan is the innocent party.

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:11.334
If you take the trouble to look,

01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:13.753
you'd see there is more to that innocence
than meets the eye.

01:43:13.813 --> 01:43:16.130
That is a despicable thing to say!

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:18.147
Oh, stop bickering!

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:28.901
My sympathies are entirely with Susan.

01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:34.523
If she had a liaison with a married man,
how would you respond?

01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:37.068
I would not forgive her.

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:39.403
Yet you "admire" Mrs Todd.

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:43.741
An admirable woman is one thing,
a wife quite another.

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:47.119
I don't think I've ever been this close
to despising you.

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:52.500
- Don't lecture me on how to live!
- And don't try to justify your position!

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.847
It is both immoral and vicious.

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:59.890
Susan is a good and intelligent wife.

01:44:00.985 --> 01:44:03.803
Or do you prefer more obvious charms?

01:44:03.863 --> 01:44:06.222
By that I assume you mean Mabel Loomis Todd?

01:44:06.282 --> 01:44:11.602
Mrs Todd, yes. And don't tell me your
intentions toward her are merely fraternal!

01:44:11.662 --> 01:44:13.938
Especially in that semi-recumbent position!

you are as ugly as your poetry!

She is incapable of making up her mind
because she is too stupid to have one!

You lash out because you are hurt or angry.

a defence against the world.

Susan in the vilest way imaginable!

and now it seems an encumbrance
to be easily put aside!

01:49:40.657 --> 01:49:44.268
Integrity, if taken too far,
can be equally ruthless.

01:56:16.678 --> 01:56:20.843
If Immortality unveil a third event to me,

01:56:22.225 --> 01:56:27.437
So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
As these that twice befell.

01:56:30.275 --> 01:56:34.610
Parting is all we know of Heaven,
And all we need of Hell.

01:56:36.323 --> 01:56:41.159
Goodbye to the life I used to live,
And the world I used to know;

01:56:42.579 --> 01:56:45.162
And kiss the hills for me, just once;

01:56:46.958 --> 01:56:49.917
Now I am ready to go!

01:56:57.844 --> 01:57:01.133
Because I could not stop for Death -

01:57:02.557 --> 01:57:04.970
He kindly stopped for me -

01:57:06.102 --> 01:57:08.970
The carriage held but just ourselves -

01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:12.143
And Immortality.

01:57:13.401 --> 01:57:16.769
We slowly drove - he knew no haste

01:57:17.822 --> 01:57:22.809
And I had put away
My labour and my leisure too,

01:57:22.869 --> 01:57:24.781
For His civility.

01:57:25.914 --> 01:57:29.024
We passed the school, where children strove,

01:57:29.084 --> 01:57:30.996
At recess - in the ring -

01:57:32.170 --> 01:57:35.208
We passed the fields of grazing grain -

01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:38.917
We passed the setting sun -

01:57:40.262 --> 01:57:44.051
Or rather - he passed us -

01:57:46.393 --> 01:57:49.586
The dews drew quivering and chill -

01:57:49.646 --> 01:57:55.358
For only gossamer, my gown -
My tippet - only tulle -

01:57:57.696 --> 01:58:02.682
We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground -

01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:07.612
The roof was scarcely visible -
The cornice - in the ground -

01:58:09.666 --> 01:58:17.915
Since then - 'tis centuries - and yet
Feels shorter than the day

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:25.297
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity -

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:37.300
This is my letter to the world,
That never wrote to me, -

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:41.570
The simple news that Nature told,
With tender majesty.

01:58:42.741 --> 01:58:47.953
Her message is committed
To hands I cannot see;

01:58:49.581 --> 01:58:55.919
For love of her, sweet countrymen,
Judge tenderly of me!

01:58:56.305 --> 01:59:02.747
