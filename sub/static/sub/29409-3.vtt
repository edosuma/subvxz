00:00.541 --> 00:01.873
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.005 --> 00:04.169
So have you two read Kirk's latest post?

00:04.235 --> 00:06.055
Still blames you and Amy for everything,

00:06.112 --> 00:08.147
but he did stop short of
calling you murderers.

00:08.248 --> 00:10.616
Well, great.
Maybe we should put that on a brochure:

00:10.717 --> 00:12.351
"Bring your horse to Heartland.
They're not murderers."

00:12.452 --> 00:16.155
Don't worry so much about
what that lunatic says.

00:16.256 --> 00:18.891
Business will pick up, you'll see.

00:18.992 --> 00:20.403
Lou?

00:20.994 --> 00:22.127
Mitch.

00:23.763 --> 00:26.999
- What're you doing here?
- I'm still in love with you.

00:29.569 --> 00:31.036
That's so sad.

00:31.137 --> 00:33.138
She was only 17.

00:34.741 --> 00:36.475
Who's June?

00:41.448 --> 00:43.015
It's time we headed back.

01:12.645 --> 01:14.847
Whoa...

01:49.983 --> 01:52.451
So Katie's trying
to use all these French words

01:52.552 --> 01:55.320
she learned in Paris,
but we're in Venice,

01:55.421 --> 01:57.755
and nobody can understand
a thing she's saying.

01:58.217 --> 01:59.858
There's a dungeon under the house!

01:59.959 --> 02:01.226
You're talking about the root cellar?

02:01.327 --> 02:03.428
There's all this cool stuff and... Jack,

02:03.530 --> 02:05.931
Jack, look what I found!

02:06.032 --> 02:08.866
See? Same as the name on the
gravestone in the cemetery.

02:08.967 --> 02:11.570
That isn't yours.
You don't touch that.

02:11.671 --> 02:13.572
What're you doing going
down in the cellar anyway?!

02:13.673 --> 02:16.575
You wanna get trapped down there?!
Are you nuts?!

02:16.676 --> 02:18.577
I don't know why it wasn't locked.

02:18.678 --> 02:20.579
Bye-bye.

02:26.886 --> 02:28.220
Why did you hit him?!

02:28.321 --> 02:30.155
You think your brother
should get away with this?

02:30.256 --> 02:32.224
Just dropping that kind of news on us?

02:32.325 --> 02:34.493
Selfish punk!
This is what he wants to do.

02:34.594 --> 02:36.495
Why can't you just let
him live his own life!

02:39.465 --> 02:41.166
Hey!

02:41.267 --> 02:43.035
You okay?

02:45.538 --> 02:46.838
Jack...

03:20.310 --> 03:23.859
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

03:50.536 --> 03:52.471
Well, it's good to see you back, Lou.

03:52.572 --> 03:54.239
Amy, I'm gonna put Lyndy
down for her nap, okay?

03:54.340 --> 03:56.241
- Thanks.
- Come here.

03:59.012 --> 04:02.447
I'm sorry I went down there.
It just looked so cool.

04:02.548 --> 04:05.550
- You should've asked someone.
- I said I'm sorry.

04:07.353 --> 04:10.837
- Why is this such a big deal?
- It's not, okay? Look,

04:11.224 --> 04:13.859
the reason Grampa freaked out on you...

04:13.960 --> 04:15.961
It's not about you.

04:16.062 --> 04:17.995
Who was June anyways?

04:18.096 --> 04:19.831
She was Grampa's sister.

04:20.267 --> 04:21.833
He didn't like her or something?

04:21.934 --> 04:23.902
No, it's nothing like that.

04:24.003 --> 04:25.504
At least, I don't think so.

04:25.605 --> 04:28.373
Well, I'm gonna go up to my room.

04:35.014 --> 04:37.282
Could you not leave your
toothbrush out on the sink?

04:37.383 --> 04:39.384
It's disgusting.

04:41.821 --> 04:44.056
Hey. Hey, you.

04:44.157 --> 04:45.557
What was that about?

04:45.658 --> 04:47.693
You have been so rude to
Luke since we got home.

04:47.794 --> 04:50.095
- What's going on?
- He got Georgie's room.

04:50.196 --> 04:51.897
We talked about this.

04:51.998 --> 04:53.532
Luke needs his own room.

04:53.633 --> 04:55.567
It's part of the deal when
you have a foster kid.

04:55.668 --> 04:57.169
And I get to live in a nursery.

04:57.270 --> 04:59.638
- Really fair, mom.
- Ah...

05:04.644 --> 05:05.744
Ringo looks great, doesn't he?

05:05.845 --> 05:08.613
- Yeah, he's gorgeous.
- I'm glad you think so.

05:08.715 --> 05:11.083
I saw him at an auction
and I just had to have him.

05:11.184 --> 05:12.951
Oh, sounds like you've got a plan.

05:13.052 --> 05:14.920
I do. Me and one of the
guys from the rodeo school

05:15.021 --> 05:17.122
are gonna enter the Hudson Team
Roping Jackpot this weekend.

05:17.223 --> 05:19.124
Wow! Jumping right in, huh?

05:19.225 --> 05:21.226
I would love to have a big,
shiny new buckle

05:21.327 --> 05:23.595
and a big fat cheque to
show Tim when he gets back.

05:23.696 --> 05:25.130
All right, well, chuck him in the box

05:25.231 --> 05:27.199
and we'll see what he can do.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.134
Okay.

05:31.237 --> 05:32.904
Whoa! Easy!

05:33.005 --> 05:35.407
Calm down! Easy!

05:35.508 --> 05:37.576
- Whoa, okay, okay. Whoa...
- Let's go.

05:37.677 --> 05:38.944
Let's take him out of the box,

05:39.045 --> 05:41.446
see if he can calm down out here.

05:41.547 --> 05:43.448
Hey, hey...

05:43.549 --> 05:46.118
Whoa... easy, boy.

05:46.219 --> 05:47.919
Okay, that was not great.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.621
I don't know what happened.

05:49.722 --> 05:51.256
He was so relaxed at the auction.

05:51.357 --> 05:53.258
He obviously doesn't like the box.

05:53.359 --> 05:55.160
No. I've seen a ton of YouTube videos.

05:55.261 --> 05:56.795
He's done this a million times.

05:56.896 --> 05:58.663
- Weird.
- Okay, let's try it again.

05:58.765 --> 06:00.365
No. That was way too out of control.

06:00.466 --> 06:02.634
We should talk to Amy before
we do anything else with him.

06:02.735 --> 06:04.469
Hey...

06:04.570 --> 06:06.371
Yeah, of course, Georgie.
I would love to.

06:06.472 --> 06:08.974
You just tell Jade to bring her
horse by and I'll have a look.

06:09.075 --> 06:11.376
Okay. 'Kay, bye.

06:11.477 --> 06:12.844
Wow, you seem excited.

06:12.945 --> 06:15.680
Yeah, well,
Jade's having an issue with her horse.

06:15.782 --> 06:17.382
Okay, that's sounds bad.
I don't mean it like...

06:17.483 --> 06:19.684
But you miss working with horses.

06:19.786 --> 06:21.486
I really do.

06:22.588 --> 06:25.157
You know this is gonna blow over, right?

06:25.258 --> 06:27.159
Come on, Amy, this online troll

06:27.260 --> 06:29.060
is not gonna take you guys down.

06:29.162 --> 06:32.030
It's just a blip.

06:32.131 --> 06:33.498
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:34.567 --> 06:36.935
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

06:44.744 --> 06:46.945
- Sorry.
- Ah, it's, it's just, it's...

06:47.046 --> 06:48.513
It's been awhile.

06:48.614 --> 06:50.482
Um...
I should probably get back to work.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.083
I just wanted to pop in

06:52.185 --> 06:53.752
- and say welcome back and...
- Okay.

06:53.853 --> 06:55.353
I'll see you at dinner tonight.

06:55.454 --> 06:57.289
- All right.
- Okay. Sounds good.

06:57.390 --> 06:58.723
Hey, hey, kiddo!

06:58.825 --> 07:01.893
- Great to be home?
- Oh yeah, really great.

07:01.994 --> 07:05.030
Wow! She's not even a teenager yet.

07:05.131 --> 07:07.098
All right, I uh...
I gotta get back to work.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.633
Okay.

07:10.444 --> 07:12.204
What was that about?

07:12.305 --> 07:14.306
She's upset about sharing a room.

07:14.407 --> 07:16.408
Uh, Lou, I'm talking about you and Mitch

07:16.509 --> 07:18.243
when Katie walked in.

07:18.344 --> 07:20.745
You haven't told her yet?
You said you were gonna do that

07:20.847 --> 07:22.414
- on your trip.
- I know, I was.

07:22.515 --> 07:24.649
But I've been reading
all these articles, okay,

07:24.750 --> 07:26.451
and they say it's not good
to introduce your child

07:26.552 --> 07:29.254
to your new partner too early.
It can confuse them.

07:29.355 --> 07:31.356
And I just... I wanna wait

07:31.457 --> 07:33.992
until Mitch and I...
have more direction.

07:34.093 --> 07:36.995
So you're just gonna keep
sneaking around forever.

07:37.096 --> 07:39.364
I know, it's awkward, but...

07:39.465 --> 07:41.533
we're just gonna keep it under wraps...

07:41.634 --> 07:43.401
at least for now.

07:43.502 --> 07:45.570
Okay. Good luck with that.

07:54.447 --> 07:56.581
I didn't know you had a cellar.

07:59.585 --> 08:02.287
Make moonshine down there?

08:02.388 --> 08:04.089
So what'd you wanna see us about?

08:04.190 --> 08:05.891
Well, it's time to hook up Stumpy's team

08:05.992 --> 08:07.792
and bring those hay
bales in from the field.

08:07.894 --> 08:09.461
- Old school!
- Yeah,

08:09.562 --> 08:11.730
that's how we do it here.
It's tradition.

08:11.831 --> 08:14.266
Now, I've got Mitch, but with Tim away

08:14.367 --> 08:16.134
I need a couple extra hands.

08:16.235 --> 08:17.502
Well, sure, I'm in.

08:17.603 --> 08:19.271
Mm...

08:19.372 --> 08:20.505
I guess.

08:20.606 --> 08:24.042
But just to be up front,
what're you paying?

08:24.143 --> 08:26.378
Two quarts of my moonshine.

08:29.248 --> 08:31.616
He's kidding, right?

08:31.717 --> 08:33.618
He's gotta be kidding.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.520
Good boy...

08:36.621 --> 08:39.758
- Come on. Good.
- Nice looking horse!

08:39.859 --> 08:42.660
Yeah, too bad he totally blew
up our first practice run.

08:42.761 --> 08:45.363
- Really?
- Yeah, big time. I was there.

08:45.464 --> 08:47.565
Yeah, and we're entered
into the Hudson Jackpot

08:47.667 --> 08:49.301
this weekend, so I'm really hoping

08:49.402 --> 08:50.969
Amy can figure out what's going on.

08:51.070 --> 08:52.704
What, you can't get your money back?

08:52.805 --> 08:55.006
I tried. The guy said he
was fine when I bought him.

08:55.107 --> 08:57.108
Have you ever heard of a Jamie Wilcox?

08:57.209 --> 08:58.677
Yes, I have.

08:58.778 --> 09:00.578
If you'd asked me about him
before you bought this horse

09:00.680 --> 09:02.714
I would've told you to stay clear.

09:02.815 --> 09:04.683
Sorry?
Why wouldn't I buy a horse from him?

09:04.784 --> 09:06.217
He's a broker. That's what he does.

09:06.319 --> 09:08.053
No, I had a friend who
bought a horse from him

09:08.154 --> 09:09.821
about a year ago.

09:09.922 --> 09:11.890
She swears he was a
completely different horse

09:11.991 --> 09:13.792
when he got home - complete basket case.

09:13.893 --> 09:15.894
She's sure that Jamie
sedated or buted the horse

09:15.995 --> 09:17.329
before auction.

09:17.430 --> 09:18.964
Maybe he did the same thing with Ringo.

09:19.065 --> 09:20.565
Hey, Ty, can you do some bloodwork?

09:20.666 --> 09:22.434
Maybe we can see if there's anything.

09:22.535 --> 09:24.169
Yeah.
The bute could've cleared his system,

09:24.270 --> 09:26.037
but it's worth a shot. Good boy.

09:26.138 --> 09:28.239
Come on.

09:37.283 --> 09:40.485
So uh... looks like you all
have everything in hand here.

09:40.586 --> 09:42.654
I'm gonna hit the sack.
It's an early morning.

09:42.755 --> 09:44.189
Okay. You say good night to G.G..

09:44.290 --> 09:46.658
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

09:46.759 --> 09:48.727
'Night, Luke.

09:48.828 --> 09:50.829
'Night.

09:50.930 --> 09:53.131
Hey, I'm sorry about this morning.

09:53.232 --> 09:55.700
I shouldn't have yelled at you, but...

09:56.836 --> 10:00.138
I just didn't want you
to get hurt is all.

10:00.239 --> 10:02.207
I won't go down there ever again.

10:02.308 --> 10:04.109
I promise.

10:09.515 --> 10:11.216
- Uh, good night, Jack.
- Yeah.

10:11.317 --> 10:12.884
And thank you for inviting me

10:12.985 --> 10:15.086
to your welcome back to Hudson dinner.

10:15.187 --> 10:17.489
- Yeah, thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

10:17.590 --> 10:21.493
Uh, all right.
I uh... you know, I'll see you later.

10:21.594 --> 10:23.294
- Okay.
- See you, guys.

10:23.396 --> 10:24.629
- See ya.
- Yeah, bye, Mitch.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.634
This jet lag is killing me.

10:29.735 --> 10:32.170
You must be so tired too, hey?

10:32.271 --> 10:34.305
Let's get ready for bed.
Good night, guys.

10:34.407 --> 10:38.143
Good night.

10:56.328 --> 10:57.996
- Hey!
- Hey! What took you so long?

10:58.097 --> 11:00.965
- I had to tuck Katie in.
- Okay.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.234
- Can I help you?
- No, take this.

11:06.772 --> 11:08.673
- You okay?
- Whoa!

11:20.252 --> 11:21.920
Ow, ow.

11:33.399 --> 11:35.100
Ungh!

11:48.881 --> 11:50.715
You guys are ridiculous.

11:50.816 --> 11:52.617
What're you talking about?

11:52.718 --> 11:54.619
I just watched Mitch
sneak out of your window

11:54.720 --> 11:56.154
and into the bushes.
He stayed the night?

11:56.255 --> 11:57.722
Shhh!

11:57.823 --> 12:00.058
Oh, come on,
you guys are like a couple of teenagers.

12:00.159 --> 12:01.993
Hey, would keep it down?

12:02.094 --> 12:05.130
Really. How long do you think
you can keep this up for?

12:11.170 --> 12:13.338
Hey.

12:13.439 --> 12:15.006
Hey. I got the blood results back.

12:15.107 --> 12:16.674
Anything there?

12:16.775 --> 12:19.511
No. But remember, there was enough time

12:19.612 --> 12:21.079
for a drug to clear his system.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.314
I just don't get it.
He seems so uncomfortable.

12:23.415 --> 12:25.483
But Jade said he was
fine when she bought him.

12:25.584 --> 12:28.419
Yeah, well,
the blood test results are clean, so...

12:35.327 --> 12:37.962
Hey!
I hear you're collecting bales tomorrow.

12:38.063 --> 12:39.964
Yes, you are correct.

12:40.966 --> 12:43.668
Okay, so what did I do wrong?

12:43.769 --> 12:45.436
Pardon me?

12:45.538 --> 12:47.505
Well, I helped out last time.

12:47.606 --> 12:48.773
So I must've done something wrong,

12:48.874 --> 12:50.441
since you didn't ask me.

12:50.543 --> 12:53.378
- No, you did fine.
- Okay, good.

12:53.479 --> 12:56.514
'Cause I'd like to help out again.

12:56.615 --> 12:58.449
You know, I appreciate the offer,

12:58.551 --> 13:00.919
but I've already got a full crew.

13:01.020 --> 13:03.121
But it was so much fun last time, Jack.

13:03.222 --> 13:06.090
Well, it's not supposed to be fun.
It's a lot of hard work.

13:06.192 --> 13:08.560
Yeah, and I'm up for it.

13:08.661 --> 13:11.696
I've-I've
got four people right now

13:11.797 --> 13:14.165
and that is the perfect number.

13:15.201 --> 13:17.435
Okay. Fine.

13:19.338 --> 13:21.706
Next time.

13:27.179 --> 13:30.682
Good boy, Ringo.
He seems to be taking all my cues.

13:30.783 --> 13:33.151
Yeah, he was like that with me too.

13:38.390 --> 13:40.625
What're you doin', sis?

13:40.726 --> 13:42.827
What does it look like?

13:44.196 --> 13:45.730
I'm fixing your horse.

13:45.831 --> 13:48.299
Who says Scout needs fixin'?

13:48.400 --> 13:50.034
Me.

13:50.135 --> 13:52.237
I've been watching you
guys rodeo every weekend.

13:52.338 --> 13:53.938
And we've been doing pretty darn good.

13:54.039 --> 13:56.975
Yeah, well pretty darn good
won't cut it down south.

13:57.076 --> 13:59.077
So I'll make you a deal.

13:59.178 --> 14:01.713
Oh yeah? What might that be?

14:01.814 --> 14:05.283
I'll get him in shape so you
can actually have a chance

14:05.384 --> 14:07.652
to win some money down there.

14:07.753 --> 14:09.187
And when you do,

14:09.288 --> 14:12.624
you take me to the Grand Ole Opry.

14:12.725 --> 14:14.726
All right, you're on.

14:20.299 --> 14:22.667
I'll go get the rope
and get him ready to go.

14:22.768 --> 14:24.068
Thanks...

14:34.327 --> 14:35.894
He seems a little off, doesn't he?

14:35.995 --> 14:37.596
Yeah,
there's definitely something going on.

14:37.697 --> 14:39.698
Yeah, you should see him
coming out of the box.

14:39.799 --> 14:41.467
Hmm. Well, let's try to track the dummy

14:41.568 --> 14:43.702
and see if we can figure it out.

14:45.839 --> 14:48.107
Ringo, hey, hey, hey, hey...
just settle down.

14:53.046 --> 14:54.580
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

14:55.782 --> 14:57.816
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

14:57.917 --> 14:59.751
Come. Settle, settle, settle, settle.

14:59.853 --> 15:03.122
Hey, hey, hey, you're fine. Ho... ho...

15:03.223 --> 15:05.390
What the heck is up him?

15:05.492 --> 15:07.493
I have a hunch,
and I don't think it has anything to do

15:07.594 --> 15:09.461
with being in the box.

15:11.898 --> 15:13.932
Well, now I'm sure Ringo
was buted at the auction.

15:14.033 --> 15:15.634
There's a few vertebrae out of place.

15:15.735 --> 15:17.436
Well, that doesn't sound good.

15:17.537 --> 15:19.238
It's not.

15:19.339 --> 15:20.839
It causes a lot of pain in his back,

15:20.940 --> 15:22.641
makes it hard to move.

15:22.742 --> 15:24.276
So that would explain why he blew up

15:24.377 --> 15:25.744
when I roped the steer dummy.

15:25.845 --> 15:27.779
Okay, well,
what about all the spinning in the box?

15:27.881 --> 15:29.515
Maybe it's the anticipation.

15:29.616 --> 15:32.050
You know, in his condition,
roping is like torture to him

15:32.152 --> 15:33.819
and the box is where it starts.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.822
Great. I got a roping
horse that can't rope.

15:36.923 --> 15:38.857
Well,
he doesn't have to retire just yet.

15:38.958 --> 15:40.726
You know,
his condition is easily managed.

15:40.827 --> 15:42.961
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:43.062 --> 15:44.863
I mean, I'll call Cassandra,
get her to do some

15:44.964 --> 15:46.732
chiropractic work,
maybe some acupuncture.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.634
And you think that'll fix it?

15:48.735 --> 15:50.469
Well, with some regular massage,

15:50.570 --> 15:52.204
I think he'll be just fine.

15:52.305 --> 15:54.306
But this condition is gonna
need ongoing treatment.

15:54.407 --> 15:55.974
Which will cost a fortune.

15:56.075 --> 15:58.911
Well, at least I can show
you the massage part.

16:07.887 --> 16:11.023
- Nice going, Luke!
- Thanks!

16:14.260 --> 16:16.228
Wow, you're doing really well!

16:16.329 --> 16:18.564
Where did you learn how to ride?

16:18.665 --> 16:20.632
Jack taught me. Wanna see us gallop?

16:20.733 --> 16:22.668
Uh, maybe just stick to a lope.

16:22.769 --> 16:25.204
Yeah, since you're just a beginner.

16:28.541 --> 16:29.841
Can you ride?

16:29.943 --> 16:33.111
I've grown up on a ranch, so yeah.

16:33.213 --> 16:34.880
Right. Of course.

16:34.981 --> 16:36.582
It's just that I've never
seen you on a horse.

16:36.683 --> 16:38.850
I've been on plenty.

16:38.952 --> 16:40.852
Wanna take a turn on Boots?

16:40.954 --> 16:42.988
Maybe you can give me a few pointers?

16:43.089 --> 16:44.690
Hey, that's a great idea.

16:45.692 --> 16:47.793
Nah, I'm kinda busy.

16:47.894 --> 16:49.795
Maybe some other time.

16:49.896 --> 16:51.897
'Kay.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.403
This is ridiculous.

16:58.504 --> 16:59.705
What's happening, buddy?

17:00.974 --> 17:02.965
Hey, man. Look at this.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.544
All these new posts bashing Amy and I,

17:05.645 --> 17:08.118
- and they all sound the same.
- What, you think this guy

17:08.247 --> 17:10.181
is writing reviews
under different names?

17:10.282 --> 17:12.483
I'm positive these are all Kirk.

17:12.585 --> 17:14.719
I mean,
it was bad enough for our business

17:14.819 --> 17:16.087
when the ranch was under quarantine,

17:16.188 --> 17:17.888
even though that wasn't our fault

17:17.990 --> 17:20.224
- and we did everything right.
- He just won't let it go?

17:20.326 --> 17:22.794
Man, that's brutal. So not fair.

17:22.895 --> 17:25.527
You know who else is
really gnawing at me?

17:26.299 --> 17:29.392
- Jamie Wilcox.
- Ugh. Me too.

17:29.702 --> 17:31.803
He sold Ringo to Jade
with a back condition,

17:31.904 --> 17:34.205
and now she's gotta cover the
cost of ongoing treatment.

17:34.307 --> 17:36.708
Man, we can't let this
sleazebag get away with this.

17:36.809 --> 17:38.376
Yeah,
but I don't know what we can do though.

17:38.477 --> 17:40.245
He can just say he didn't
know about the back condition,

17:40.346 --> 17:43.715
and there was no trace
of bute in his blood.

17:43.816 --> 17:45.483
You sure about that?

17:45.585 --> 17:47.118
Yeah, I know how to read a lab report.

17:47.219 --> 17:49.754
What if you made a mistake
just this one time?

17:49.855 --> 17:51.957
What if Ringo did test
positive for bute.

17:52.692 --> 17:53.725
What?

17:53.826 --> 17:55.827
Jamie would be trapped
into telling the truth.

17:55.928 --> 17:57.495
He might even give Jade her money back.

17:57.597 --> 17:59.731
Caleb, are you nuts?

17:59.832 --> 18:01.633
Amy and I are trying to
rebuild our reputation.

18:01.734 --> 18:03.268
I'm not gonna lie about test results.

18:03.369 --> 18:06.371
Wilcox is the one who's lying!

18:06.472 --> 18:08.306
Caleb,
I wanna get this guy as bad as you do,

18:08.407 --> 18:10.075
but not like that.

18:11.310 --> 18:13.211
'Kay, fine. All right.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.947
We're not letting this go though.

18:26.659 --> 18:28.526
Okay,
so should I take notes or something?

18:28.628 --> 18:30.362
No. You're gonna do this with me.

18:31.397 --> 18:33.865
Come on, I'll show you.
It's not that hard.

18:38.170 --> 18:41.139
So you wanna work in circular motions,
okay?

18:41.240 --> 18:44.009
You wanna put a nice amount
of pressure in there.

18:47.413 --> 18:49.981
Look, he likes it.

18:51.417 --> 18:53.985
Bring it down his spine.

18:56.255 --> 18:58.123
- Wanna switch?
- Okay.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.933
Hey, buddy?

19:09.035 --> 19:10.468
You like it?

19:21.447 --> 19:22.781
He said yes!

19:26.152 --> 19:28.319
- He said yes.
- What're you talking about?

19:28.421 --> 19:31.122
Dad says I can drive the stone boat.

19:31.223 --> 19:34.610
Really. A girl doing ranch work?

19:35.394 --> 19:38.263
- Doesn't sound like Dad.
- He's got no choice.

19:38.364 --> 19:40.465
You're going to Nashville
and it's a two-man job.

19:40.566 --> 19:43.868
Sorry, it's a two-person job now.

19:43.969 --> 19:45.737
Never driven a stone boat before.

19:45.838 --> 19:47.205
I'll figure it out. You did.

19:50.743 --> 19:53.845
Maybe I oughta stick around
for another week, help out.

19:53.946 --> 19:55.346
I'd have to miss the first rodeo, but...

19:55.448 --> 19:58.717
- Don't you dare.
- Why?

19:58.818 --> 20:00.385
Don't go getting cold feet.

20:02.488 --> 20:05.290
Dad was too afraid to leave this ranch,

20:05.391 --> 20:07.192
take any chances.

20:08.961 --> 20:10.962
Look what it's done to him.

20:16.769 --> 20:19.571
Get up.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.358
Wow, he is so smooth!

20:41.794 --> 20:45.130
Now we just have to continue
doing this... forever.

20:45.231 --> 20:47.132
Well, it is gonna be an ongoing routine,

20:47.233 --> 20:49.868
but the pain is gone.

20:49.969 --> 20:52.003
So can we do an actual run?

20:52.104 --> 20:53.404
I think that's enough for today.

20:53.506 --> 20:55.006
We made some great progress.

20:55.107 --> 20:57.142
But hey, how 'bout tomorrow...
you and Ringo,

20:57.243 --> 20:59.611
and Spartan and I try it for real?

20:59.712 --> 21:01.212
'Kay, sounds like fun.

21:01.313 --> 21:02.814
Hey, buddy?

21:02.915 --> 21:04.949
Ty! I did it, man!

21:05.050 --> 21:06.785
- I've got the perfect plan.
- Okay.

21:06.886 --> 21:08.553
Wilcox just put another
horse up for sale.

21:08.654 --> 21:10.955
I did a little sleuthing,
turns out said horse

21:11.056 --> 21:12.590
has been acting up in training.

21:12.691 --> 21:14.159
So he's probably gonna drug it.

21:14.260 --> 21:17.061
Uh-huh. Exactly!
We're gonna catch him red handed.

21:17.163 --> 21:19.297
Wait, so this is where your
perfect plan comes into play?

21:19.398 --> 21:21.800
Yes, it is.

21:21.901 --> 21:23.301
Hi, Jamie Wilcox?

21:23.402 --> 21:27.071
Yeah, this is Caleb Odell.
I saw your ad about the horse.

21:27.173 --> 21:28.573
Yeah,
I'd love to come by and check him out.

21:28.674 --> 21:30.375
That would be amazing.

21:30.476 --> 21:32.544
Beautiful. Okay, great.

21:33.879 --> 21:35.647
- Ooh, what about that one?
- Oh, no.

21:35.748 --> 21:37.415
That looks like something
Olivia would wear.

21:37.516 --> 21:38.950
Can you imagine if I showed up to grad

21:39.051 --> 21:42.420
- in the same dress as her?
- Okay, point taken.

21:42.521 --> 21:44.956
Hey, Mitch! I wasn't expecting you.

21:45.057 --> 21:47.091
Well, uh, that's uh...
I'm here to see Jack.

21:47.193 --> 21:49.527
Oh yeah? What can I do you for?

21:49.628 --> 21:52.463
Garland called.
He, uh, he wants to meet up tomorrow

21:52.565 --> 21:54.399
to talk about some new
delivery procedures.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.302
Well, we can't. We're collecting bales.

21:58.904 --> 22:01.406
I can take Mitch's
place collecting bales.

22:01.507 --> 22:03.508
That's not a bad idea because...

22:03.609 --> 22:05.510
then I could go to the meeting.

22:05.611 --> 22:08.079
Yeah. You cool with that, Jack?

22:10.916 --> 22:12.450
It'll be fine.

22:12.551 --> 22:15.086
Okay. Awesome! Can't wait.

22:15.187 --> 22:16.287
Um, I'm gonna go to bed.

22:16.388 --> 22:19.123
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

22:19.225 --> 22:21.226
All right, well, I'll see you later?

22:21.327 --> 22:23.428
I'll see you later too.
See you all later.

22:23.529 --> 22:26.130
Uh, you fill me in on what Garland says.

22:26.232 --> 22:27.565
Will do.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.334
Bye.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.837
I think I'm gonna pack it in, Grampa.

22:32.938 --> 22:34.572
What, another early night?

22:34.673 --> 22:37.475
Yeah, it's just this jet lag.
It's crazy and...

22:38.911 --> 22:40.879
Anyway, good night, Grampa.

23:03.769 --> 23:06.337
What're you doing?

23:06.438 --> 23:08.139
What?

23:09.708 --> 23:11.175
He'll never notice.

23:11.277 --> 23:13.177
You're really gonna drink that?

23:16.181 --> 23:18.616
You really wanna end
up like the old man?

24:14.340 --> 24:15.974
Whoa!

24:16.075 --> 24:17.742
Ja... Hey, d-don't shoot!

24:17.843 --> 24:20.111
Grampa! Put that thing down!

24:27.480 --> 24:30.392
You're gonna hurt someone, grandpa.
What were you thinking?

24:30.437 --> 24:32.972
I was thinking someone was
breaking into my house.

24:33.073 --> 24:34.740
I'm... so sorry.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.109
Look, we're in a weird
place with Katie right now.

24:37.211 --> 24:38.945
I-I-I don't wanna tell her about us yet,

24:39.046 --> 24:40.813
and we're just trying
to do the right thing.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.682
The right thing of sneaking him in

24:42.783 --> 24:44.250
through the bedroom window?

24:44.351 --> 24:45.618
Is that how you want her to find out?

24:45.719 --> 24:47.620
- I know, okay? It was stupid.
- Look, we're...

24:47.721 --> 24:49.822
we're trying to figure this out, okay?
It's not easy.

24:49.923 --> 24:52.124
And... so just spare us the guilt trip.

24:52.226 --> 24:53.826
This is some grown-up
stuff we're dealing with.

24:53.927 --> 24:56.229
Then maybe you oughta start
acting like grown-ups.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.764
You know, if I'd tried to
sneak a girl into my room

24:58.865 --> 25:00.366
while I was living under my dad's roof,

25:00.467 --> 25:03.336
he probably would've gone
and pulled the trigger.

25:28.262 --> 25:30.396
Hey, uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's just hold on a minute.

25:30.497 --> 25:33.599
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Why don't you and Georgie

25:33.700 --> 25:35.401
switch places for a little while.

25:35.502 --> 25:38.137
Yeah, these are pretty heavy.

25:38.238 --> 25:40.273
No. No, you've never driven a team.

25:40.374 --> 25:41.941
Oh, come on, Jack.

25:42.042 --> 25:44.277
It's a hay wagon moving
at a snail's pace.

25:44.378 --> 25:46.312
She'll be fine.

25:46.413 --> 25:48.214
Please?

25:57.090 --> 25:58.758
Fine.

25:58.859 --> 26:01.627
Come up here and I'll show
you what you're doing.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.201
Hey, Katie.
Wanna take my horse for a spin?

26:09.303 --> 26:11.296
- No, thanks.
- Oh...

26:11.605 --> 26:14.173
- I think I get it now.
- Get what?

26:14.274 --> 26:16.142
You haven't ridden for a while.

26:17.311 --> 26:21.123
He's not wrong, Katie.
You've been away a lot lately.

26:21.548 --> 26:23.215
Gimme that helmet.

26:28.155 --> 26:31.457
All right. So we'll just
take it nice and slow, okay?

26:31.558 --> 26:33.426
It's be awhile.

26:35.429 --> 26:36.996
Mom!

26:37.097 --> 26:40.232
Settle down. You're okay, you're okay.

26:40.334 --> 26:43.369
Whoa... maybe loosen up a little.

26:43.470 --> 26:46.539
Loosen up a little?
You're giving me riding tips?

26:46.640 --> 26:48.541
Sorry, you just...

26:48.642 --> 26:50.576
you just seemed a bit anxious.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.046
Your horse doesn't know
how to take direction,

26:54.147 --> 26:56.482
- that's all.
- Katie!

26:58.485 --> 27:00.286
It was really great roping
with you guys today.

27:00.387 --> 27:03.289
You and Ringo were amazing.
I was super impressed.

27:03.390 --> 27:05.925
Well, it was all him.

27:06.026 --> 27:09.295
So you know that Jackpot tomorrow?

27:09.396 --> 27:11.397
Well, my partner quit on me

27:11.498 --> 27:13.799
'cause of all of Ringo's issues.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.568
So I was thinking that...

27:15.669 --> 27:18.704
maybe you and Spartan
would wanna do it with us?

27:18.805 --> 27:21.240
I don't know.

27:21.341 --> 27:22.975
I could pay you with
all the money we win.

27:23.076 --> 27:26.278
Well, you know,
getting paid would be nice.

27:26.380 --> 27:28.147
So... you'll do it?

27:28.248 --> 27:29.815
I gotta check with Spartan.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.817
Hey, what do you think, bud?

27:31.918 --> 27:33.619
I think that's a yes. Yeah, we're in.

27:34.688 --> 27:37.523
Hey! How'd it go with Garland?

27:37.624 --> 27:40.292
Turns out he did not wanna
talk about delivery procedures.

27:40.394 --> 27:43.396
He just wanted to badger
me about getting more beef.

27:43.497 --> 27:45.431
You ever gonna pull
Grampa around on that?

27:45.532 --> 27:48.801
Uh... I'm not exactly in his
good books right now, Lou, so...

27:48.902 --> 27:51.437
He'll get over that little scene.

27:51.538 --> 27:54.140
Little scene? He... had a shotgun.

27:54.241 --> 27:56.342
Okay, fine, it was a debacle.

27:56.443 --> 27:58.144
But he has a right to be mad.

27:58.245 --> 27:59.979
I mean, we shouldn't be
sneaking around like this.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.149
Yeah, I know.
I've been saying that since day one.

28:03.250 --> 28:06.452
It has to stop.
I have to tell Katie about us.

28:06.553 --> 28:09.321
Good. Great. I... I don't know why

28:09.423 --> 28:11.957
you've been keeping it
a secret for so long.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.326
Because it's a big deal, Mitch,

28:14.428 --> 28:16.228
and I just...

28:16.329 --> 28:17.830
I wanted to be sure that you're serious.

28:17.931 --> 28:19.999
Lou!

28:20.100 --> 28:22.001
Look, you know how I feel about you.

28:22.102 --> 28:23.436
Actually, I don't.

28:23.537 --> 28:25.337
You never talk about
our future and I just...

28:25.439 --> 28:27.840
That's because you never talk about it.
Ever. Not once.

28:27.941 --> 28:30.476
Um,
I was ready to storm into your wedding

28:30.577 --> 28:33.179
and profess my love for you.
Didn't that say everything?

28:33.280 --> 28:34.647
I've been risking my life

28:34.748 --> 28:36.549
sneaking into your room every night.

28:36.650 --> 28:38.851
Does that not say everything?

28:38.952 --> 28:40.653
Well, I guess our actions
have been speaking louder

28:40.754 --> 28:42.555
than our words.

28:44.558 --> 28:46.592
But just to confirm...

28:46.693 --> 28:48.561
you're all in?

28:53.567 --> 28:55.067
Uh, actually,

28:55.168 --> 28:56.702
I think I'm just gonna...

28:56.803 --> 28:59.338
continue to let my actions...

28:59.439 --> 29:02.141
speak for themselves.

29:11.451 --> 29:12.885
- Good...
- 'Kay, swing 'em around

29:12.986 --> 29:15.020
and we'll start on that next row.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.522
Got it.

29:19.359 --> 29:21.393
Remember how I showed you
to rein those work horses.

29:21.495 --> 29:23.629
- Yeah, I know.
- They act up, don't be afraid

29:23.730 --> 29:25.531
to show 'em who's boss.

29:25.632 --> 29:27.366
I know. I know.

29:27.467 --> 29:29.802
Why don't you just... get on outta here?

29:39.646 --> 29:41.514
Jack, go.

29:43.016 --> 29:45.084
I am going to miss you.

29:45.185 --> 29:46.652
Yeah, me too.

29:46.753 --> 29:48.921
But I'm gonna be down there so soon.

29:49.022 --> 29:50.656
We have a deal.

29:50.757 --> 29:52.658
Right.

30:12.212 --> 30:13.646
Ungh!

30:20.420 --> 30:22.555
Whoa... easy.

30:25.025 --> 30:27.560
Jack?

30:27.661 --> 30:28.794
Georgie!

30:31.064 --> 30:32.932
No...

30:33.033 --> 30:35.134
You okay, Jack?

30:35.235 --> 30:37.570
Get control of 'em! Georgie!

30:37.671 --> 30:38.904
I am!

30:48.214 --> 30:50.482
Ahhh!

30:50.584 --> 30:52.618
Ahhhh!

31:15.942 --> 31:18.744
Georgie!

31:18.845 --> 31:21.413
Georgie!

31:21.514 --> 31:24.550
You can't lose focus like that.
Pay attention!

31:24.651 --> 31:26.552
I am paying attention.
We just hit a rut.

31:26.653 --> 31:28.654
- Jack, what's going on?
- We almost had a wreck,

31:28.755 --> 31:30.356
- that's what!
- No, we didn't!

31:30.457 --> 31:31.957
Everything seems all right.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.326
I'm driving from now on.

31:34.427 --> 31:36.996
I don't wanna hear a word about it.
End of discussion!

31:49.994 --> 31:51.928
Do you wanna give momma a
high-five for good luck?

31:52.029 --> 31:53.964
- Yes!
- You two stay out of trouble, okay?

31:54.065 --> 31:55.565
I'm gonna go win this thing with Jade.

31:55.666 --> 31:57.634
Well, I-I actually can't promise that.

31:57.735 --> 32:00.036
Caleb and I are gonna go
give Jamie Wilcox a visit.

32:00.137 --> 32:02.839
- What are you two up to?
- Do you really wanna know?

32:02.940 --> 32:05.275
Just don't do anything stupid, okay?

32:05.376 --> 32:07.644
Oh, me? Caleb? Of course not.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.414
I'm gonna give Lyndy to Jack.

32:11.515 --> 32:12.916
Maybe some time with his granddaughter

32:13.017 --> 32:14.517
will put him in a better headspace.

32:14.618 --> 32:17.120
Yeah...
yeah, he's been a little off lately.

32:17.221 --> 32:19.189
Did you hear what happened
yesterday in the field?

32:19.290 --> 32:20.757
No.

32:20.858 --> 32:22.726
He totally lost it on Georgie.

32:22.827 --> 32:24.494
- Why?
- I don't know.

32:24.595 --> 32:26.429
She was driving the
horses and they spooked,

32:26.530 --> 32:28.765
no big deal, but he gets so angry,

32:28.866 --> 32:30.767
he's panicking and...

32:30.868 --> 32:33.470
it wasn't like him at all.

32:33.571 --> 32:34.871
Hmm.

32:46.283 --> 32:48.892
- Caleb Odell.
- Hey, Jamie.

32:50.287 --> 32:52.155
I've been looking forward
to seeing this guy.

32:52.256 --> 32:54.491
I heard he's a hell of a horse.
He sure is.

32:54.592 --> 32:56.893
Had a great season last year too, but...

32:56.994 --> 33:00.230
sky's the limit under the right cowboy.

33:00.331 --> 33:02.565
Looks a little relaxed.

33:02.666 --> 33:04.501
You sure he's got the
fire I'm gonna need?

33:04.602 --> 33:06.903
See for yourself.
Take him for a test drive.

33:07.004 --> 33:10.140
Nah, I've done my research.
I know what he can do.

33:10.241 --> 33:12.175
What do you say we get down to it...

33:12.276 --> 33:14.244
- go inside and talk business.
- Well, we can talk out here.

33:14.345 --> 33:16.679
Yeah, we could,
but wouldn't you rather be

33:16.781 --> 33:18.648
where there's a pen and a bill of sale?

33:18.749 --> 33:21.618
I like a man
who knows what he wants.

33:40.037 --> 33:42.705
Hey, boy, hey...

33:43.841 --> 33:45.942
Hey.

33:46.043 --> 33:47.811
Easy now.

33:47.912 --> 33:50.146
Easy now.

33:50.247 --> 33:52.615
I'm just gonna give you a little poke,
okay?

33:52.716 --> 33:54.384
'Kay.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.155
There you go. Good boy.

33:59.256 --> 34:01.558
Good boy.

34:01.659 --> 34:02.926
Okay.

34:08.866 --> 34:10.033
Mm! Oh!

34:15.940 --> 34:17.306
I promise you,
I'd get more than that

34:17.408 --> 34:19.375
at the auction house, but...

34:19.476 --> 34:20.976
I know you're the right
guy for the horse,

34:21.078 --> 34:24.246
so I'd rather lose a couple
bucks and sell him to you.

34:24.348 --> 34:27.382
Well, that's mighty kind of you.

34:27.485 --> 34:29.619
And I would love to get him,

34:29.719 --> 34:33.356
but, uh,
if you want me to go any higher,

34:33.456 --> 34:35.291
I'm gonna have to talk to my wife.

34:35.391 --> 34:38.261
Talk to your wife?

34:38.362 --> 34:40.630
Come on now, Caleb, who wears the pants?

34:40.731 --> 34:43.099
She does, trust me.

34:46.003 --> 34:48.404
Is it just me,
or does his leg feel a little hot?

34:48.505 --> 34:50.106
- What?
- Yeah.

34:53.844 --> 34:56.079
- Nah, I don't think so.
- Ah, you're right.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.848
Never mind, it's my mistake.
Anyways, I'm gonna get going,

34:58.949 --> 35:00.617
see if I can get the wife on board.

35:00.718 --> 35:02.652
Well, make it quick,

35:02.753 --> 35:04.921
before someone makes me an
offer that I can't refuse.

35:05.022 --> 35:07.657
Okay, will do.

35:10.027 --> 35:11.561
I have to admit, I'm kinda surprised

35:11.662 --> 35:13.296
you want a riding
lesson all of a sudden.

35:13.397 --> 35:14.898
Any reason?

35:14.999 --> 35:16.799
No,
I just wanna shake off the rust a bit.

35:16.901 --> 35:18.635
There's my girls.

35:18.736 --> 35:20.170
Yeah, here we are.

35:20.271 --> 35:22.038
Yeah, I just,
I saw you guys from the window

35:22.139 --> 35:25.241
and I thought I'd come out and...
say hey.

35:25.342 --> 35:27.677
- Say hey?
- Yeah, you know,

35:27.778 --> 35:30.446
it's just so rare the
three of us get to chat.

35:30.548 --> 35:33.616
Just wanted to come and check in.

35:33.717 --> 35:36.653
- You're acting weird.
- No, I'm not.

35:36.754 --> 35:39.422
Is this about Jack losing
it on me yesterday?

35:39.523 --> 35:41.624
What? No. What happened?

35:41.725 --> 35:44.827
Oh no, it's fine.
I don't think it was actually about me.

35:44.929 --> 35:46.162
What do you wanna talk about then?

35:46.263 --> 35:47.830
I just,

35:47.932 --> 35:50.311
I hope this isn't too
much for you to handle.

35:51.368 --> 35:54.070
I've read it can be tough for
you to process at this age.

35:54.171 --> 35:55.371
I know what you're talking about.

35:55.472 --> 35:57.874
Yeah, okay, so here goes.

35:57.975 --> 35:59.691
The thing is...

36:00.644 --> 36:01.811
the thing is...

36:01.912 --> 36:04.714
- Mitch and I...
- He's your boyfriend.

36:04.815 --> 36:06.983
- You knew?
- Uh, hello.

36:07.084 --> 36:09.385
You kept on sending him
all these kissy face emojis

36:09.486 --> 36:11.821
when we were away. Kinda obvious.

36:13.524 --> 36:15.525
Busted!

36:16.660 --> 36:18.361
Can we do that riding lesson now?

36:18.462 --> 36:20.964
Yeah, sure.

36:21.065 --> 36:22.198
Good talk!

36:23.200 --> 36:25.768
And now for a couple of hometown heroes!

36:25.869 --> 36:28.338
One of the best in the broncs,
Jade Virani,

36:28.439 --> 36:30.673
teamed up with Hudson's
very own miracle girl,

36:30.774 --> 36:32.375
Amy Fleming.

36:32.476 --> 36:34.777
They have the best time
over the first three rounds,

36:34.878 --> 36:36.846
but it all comes down to this...

36:36.947 --> 36:39.115
catch the steer and they win.

36:39.216 --> 36:41.117
Miss him and the Barkley brothers

36:41.218 --> 36:43.186
will sneak in for the buckle.

36:43.287 --> 36:44.887
And there they go!

36:52.563 --> 36:55.832
Nice throw, Jade! Now it's up to Amy.

36:58.702 --> 37:01.771
Only one leg, so a five second penalty,

37:01.872 --> 37:04.340
but seven twenty-three is the time.

37:04.441 --> 37:06.809
We have our winners!

37:31.268 --> 37:32.635
Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen

37:32.736 --> 37:36.372
to Nashville,
Tennessee's 10th annual rodeo!

38:28.659 --> 38:30.493
G.G.!

38:30.594 --> 38:32.095
G.G.!

38:34.131 --> 38:35.798
Oh, sorry, sweetie.

38:35.899 --> 38:37.233
I'm sorry.

38:37.334 --> 38:40.002
Okay. Shhhwwwooooo.

38:40.104 --> 38:43.639
And he's got the beautiful little calf.

39:00.313 --> 39:02.147
- Yeah, that's...
- Grampa!

39:02.248 --> 39:04.950
Check out my buckle! We won!

39:05.051 --> 39:07.461
Wow! Holy!

39:07.720 --> 39:09.922
That is a beauty.

39:10.023 --> 39:12.024
Wish I was there to
see you guys in action.

39:12.125 --> 39:14.059
I am just so proud of Ringo,
he was amazing,

39:14.160 --> 39:16.028
and Jade, she was super sweet

39:16.129 --> 39:17.896
and posted this glowing online review.

39:17.997 --> 39:20.833
That oughta help spread the
word in a good way this time.

39:20.934 --> 39:22.601
Yeah.

39:22.702 --> 39:25.070
Hey, Grampa, do you wanna go for a ride,

39:25.171 --> 39:27.806
just the two of us? Lou can watch Lyndy.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.075
Well, that's a real nice thought, but...

39:30.176 --> 39:32.044
I've got work to tend to.

39:32.145 --> 39:34.046
It's just we haven't spent a
lot of time together lately

39:34.147 --> 39:37.282
and... I dunno,
I think we could both use the fresh air.

39:39.953 --> 39:41.353
Okay.

39:42.489 --> 39:44.890
I'll get Buddy tacked up.

39:48.495 --> 39:50.529
So she knew the entire time?

39:50.630 --> 39:53.065
Yup. I was driving
myself crazy for nothing.

39:53.166 --> 39:54.800
Oh,
don't forget you almost got me killed!

39:54.901 --> 39:56.869
- Oh, don't be so dramatic.
- I'm serious!

39:56.970 --> 39:58.837
I'm gonna be walking on
eggshells around Jack

39:58.938 --> 40:00.205
for the next little while, I know it.

40:00.306 --> 40:02.341
He'll get over it.

40:02.442 --> 40:04.610
Besides,
we don't need to sneak around anymore.

40:04.711 --> 40:06.545
You really think he's
gonna be okay with me

40:06.646 --> 40:08.080
staying in your room?

40:08.181 --> 40:09.648
Well, he's gonna have to be.

40:09.749 --> 40:11.817
I don't know, Lou.
Something about me staying at Heartland

40:11.918 --> 40:14.019
just still feels awkward.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.787
Whoa, okay. Hang on a sec.

40:15.889 --> 40:18.123
I just told my girls
that you're my boyfriend

40:18.224 --> 40:20.359
because you said you were "all in"

40:20.460 --> 40:22.861
and now you're saying...

40:22.962 --> 40:25.097
what exactly are you saying?

40:29.536 --> 40:33.238
I'm saying that I think
that we should get our...

40:33.339 --> 40:35.340
our own place together.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.111
You mean... move in together?

40:40.113 --> 40:41.980
Yeah.

40:42.081 --> 40:43.815
Well, what do...

40:43.917 --> 40:46.118
what do you think?

40:58.264 --> 41:00.165
- What happened to the signal?
- Well, it's real tough

41:00.266 --> 41:02.534
to whistle and talk at the same time.

41:02.635 --> 41:04.736
Did you get the lab results from Scott?

41:04.837 --> 41:06.872
- Yeah, I got 'em.
- Yes!

41:17.050 --> 41:19.084
I hope you brought your cheque book.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.886
I brought something,

41:20.987 --> 41:22.741
but it isn't my cheque book.

41:23.723 --> 41:25.691
Hey, uh... you work with Scott.

41:25.792 --> 41:27.559
Why did you bring him?

41:27.660 --> 41:29.695
Truth is, I came out here to
see if you drugged that horse...

41:29.796 --> 41:31.597
the same way you did Ringo,

41:31.698 --> 41:33.265
the horse you sold to my friend Jade.

41:33.366 --> 41:35.300
- No, I didn't.
- Don't bother.

41:35.401 --> 41:36.602
We've got proof.

41:36.703 --> 41:39.071
See that?
Those are results of the blood test

41:39.172 --> 41:40.305
we took earlier today.

41:40.406 --> 41:42.074
I was with you the whole time.

41:42.175 --> 41:44.176
- That's why Ty took it.
- What're you talking about?

41:44.277 --> 41:45.544
Let's just get to the report, okay?

41:45.645 --> 41:47.546
You loaded that horse full of sedatives.

41:47.647 --> 41:50.115
Huh. You come onto my property

41:50.216 --> 41:51.650
and take blood from my horse.

41:51.751 --> 41:53.919
I was looking out for the
safety of that animal, okay?

41:54.020 --> 41:56.655
- No one's gonna question that.
- And now that we've got proof

41:56.756 --> 41:58.957
that you drug problem
horses to sell them...

41:59.058 --> 42:00.626
That kind of thing'll get you
banned from auction houses,

42:00.727 --> 42:02.794
- won't it?
- Yeah, if...

42:02.895 --> 42:04.329
if we were to share it.

42:06.766 --> 42:08.433
Are you threatening me?

42:09.535 --> 42:12.137
Yes. We'll report you

42:12.238 --> 42:14.406
if you don't give Jade her money back.

42:14.507 --> 42:16.875
She's gonna need it to
keep treating that horse.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.946
- You'll keep your mouths shut?
- For now.

42:21.047 --> 42:23.882
- But I'm keeping the report.
- And we'll be watching you.

42:23.983 --> 42:25.951
You ever pull a stunt like this again,

42:26.052 --> 42:28.020
we'll drop the hammer.

42:28.121 --> 42:29.955
Now if I were you,

42:30.056 --> 42:32.324
I'd run along and get your cheque book.

42:43.036 --> 42:44.703
Oh man...

42:44.804 --> 42:46.672
You were so stealth.

42:46.773 --> 42:49.274
You are crazy, you know that?

42:49.375 --> 42:51.977
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

42:56.916 --> 42:59.818
This is one of my most favourite spots.

42:59.919 --> 43:01.920
Yeah, mine too.

43:04.023 --> 43:07.959
Hey, Grampa,
can I ask you about something?

43:08.061 --> 43:09.494
You just haven't been yourself

43:09.595 --> 43:12.264
since Luke brought up
that box from the cellar

43:12.365 --> 43:14.266
with June's name on it.

43:15.401 --> 43:17.736
Why do you pretend like
your sister never existed?

43:17.837 --> 43:20.472
- That's not true.
- But you never talk about her.

43:20.573 --> 43:22.741
Not even with your own family. I... why?

43:22.842 --> 43:24.643
I don't get it.

43:27.146 --> 43:28.847
Because it was my fault.

43:28.948 --> 43:31.539
The reason June died was my fault.
