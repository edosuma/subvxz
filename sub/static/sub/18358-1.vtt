03:04.060 --> 03:05.741
can't you just wait
until the party starts?

03:05.770 --> 03:08.564

We have a range of competitively priced

05:20.196 --> 05:22.322
We could also look at laying
down cables,

05:22.364 --> 05:24.324
but this does mean
additional workforce.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.160
The rural areas
are so mountainous

05:26.202 --> 05:27.494
and the winters get so harsh

that laying copper
is just not feasible.

is a cellular solution.

similar terrain issues.

05:38.923 --> 05:41.592
I mean cellular really
is the best approach.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.846
But all the mountains
mean more cell towers.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.599
Otherwise, too much dead zone.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.685
That's why we're looking for

34:42.998 --> 34:45.542
- Yes.
- Show me.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.632
Did you get all that?

34:54.010 --> 34:55.511
Yeah, I heard.

34:55.552 --> 34:58.096
Did you get those supplies?

34:58.138 --> 34:59.849
<i>Yes, I have the supplies.</i>

34:59.890 --> 35:01.771
All right, good. Hurry back
as quick as you can.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.478
What's going on?

35:09.566 --> 35:11.318
Uh...

35:14.030 --> 35:16.782
General Lazar is here.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.951
Well, that was to be expected.

35:18.993 --> 35:21.787
This place has a special
importance for him.

35:21.829 --> 35:23.121
He want to gloat.

35:23.163 --> 35:27.084
He's going on TV at 6:00 am
to declare his victory.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.088
So, uh, guess we know
who's running the show now.

35:33.423 --> 35:36.176
I need to get a broadcast
out ahead of him.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.118
We meet again.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.329
Am I invited to the party?

36:04.371 --> 36:10.335
Um, it's been a long night.
I needed something to eat.

36:10.377 --> 36:13.380
Well, there's plenty
to celebrate.

36:17.885 --> 36:19.219
TANIA:
<i>Maybe you don't get it</i>

36:19.261 --> 36:22.556
because democracy is
old news in the west.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.349
(UNDER BREATH)
Jesus Christ...

36:24.391 --> 36:27.019
We are in the middle
of a moment.

36:27.061 --> 36:30.522
People who have never known
freedom are rising up,

36:30.564 --> 36:35.861
but this moment is as
fragile as butterfly wings.

36:35.903 --> 36:40.032
The West come in with too heavy
a hand and we fall apart.

36:40.074 --> 36:42.284
The tyrants get away
with their brutality

36:42.325 --> 36:44.536
and it will take us
another 20 years

36:44.578 --> 36:48.749
and another generation
for another moment to arise.

36:50.793 --> 36:53.545
I mean, no wonder Lazar
tried to kill you.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.297
(SCOFFS)

36:55.338 --> 36:58.425
So, are you going to help me?

37:00.302 --> 37:04.264

a look at that wound.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.610
Your floor, I think.

37:18.779 --> 37:22.658
Oh, um, no, I'm on the third floor.
One more.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.952
Of course.

37:27.871 --> 37:31.416
There's something I've forgotten.
Please excuse me.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.919
You, with me.

37:33.961 --> 37:37.214
Go ahead and set up.
I'll join you shortly.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.050
Good evening.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.264
Check every room.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.308
There's something not right.

37:52.479 --> 37:55.524
You know, your technique
is pretty professional.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.109
(SCOFFS)

37:57.151 --> 37:59.653
I was a pediatrician
before this.

37:59.695 --> 38:01.613
Oh, yeah?

38:01.655 --> 38:03.281
What, after looking
after all those kids,

38:03.323 --> 38:05.034
you never had any of your own?

38:10.206 --> 38:12.124
<i>My second time in jail,</i>

38:12.166 --> 38:14.168
Lazar was very angry with me.

38:15.919 --> 38:20.382
After he so generously
let me out,

38:20.423 --> 38:23.343
I went back and started
protesting again.

38:25.762 --> 38:28.891
He hit me in the stomach
with a lead pipe.

38:32.853 --> 38:36.232
So after that,
I couldn't have children.

38:38.942 --> 38:41.070
I'm sorry.

38:44.865 --> 38:49.203
You know, you really are a lot
more gentle than you let on.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.374
I think you've been hurt enough.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.057

39:14.270 --> 39:16.396
MAN: Open up.
Check that door.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.572
They're gonna be here
in a second.

39:25.614 --> 39:28.408
I need to hide you, okay?
Come on.

39:28.450 --> 39:29.910
- (GROANS)
- Sorry.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.222
I need you to lie down flat.

39:50.264 --> 39:53.725
As flat as you can.
Come on.

39:53.767 --> 39:54.851
There you go.

40:19.126 --> 40:20.710
Coming.

40:29.136 --> 40:30.470
Just a second.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.987
VORZA: Open the door. Open
up, this is your last chance.

40:52.659 --> 40:55.620
Oh, hi, guys. I'm sorry.
I was in the john.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.621
How can I help?

40:56.663 --> 40:59.124
You really should be downstairs.

40:59.166 --> 41:02.961
We don't want civilians running
around, getting into trouble.

41:03.003 --> 41:05.463
Yeah, uh, sorry.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.632
I recognize you.

41:07.674 --> 41:10.386
You were at the reception
earlier with...

41:10.427 --> 41:13.972

Is that her name?

41:14.014 --> 41:16.975
Yes, yes, we're here to, uh,
expand the cell phone network.

- Ah! Holy shit.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.815
Oh, God, uh...

41:23.857 --> 41:26.484
- What are you doing?
- I was, uh...

41:26.526 --> 41:29.154
going to show you a brochure.

41:29.196 --> 41:31.907
If you want.
Yeah? I'm sorry.

That's my company, Trans-global.

41:44.044 --> 41:46.671

But I think Lazar came out here

55:39.087 --> 55:41.338
to meet someone
like me, a fixer.

55:41.380 --> 55:44.842
See, a coup isn't pulled
together in a vacuum.

55:44.884 --> 55:46.343
The leaders would make sure

55:46.385 --> 55:49.055
they have at least tacit outside
support before they move,

55:49.097 --> 55:50.681
corporations that would jump in

55:50.723 --> 55:52.183
and do business with new bosses.

55:52.225 --> 55:54.518
Mm. All in exchange

55:54.560 --> 55:56.854
for extremely favorable
contracts

55:56.896 --> 55:58.273
to be negotiated later.

55:58.314 --> 56:00.441
- Right.
- I still don't see how it helps though.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.278
Because there's more
going on here than a coup.

56:03.319 --> 56:06.739
I think Lazar just met
with his fixer and...

56:08.324 --> 56:10.743
I think I know who it is.

56:11.994 --> 56:13.305
I'm gonna try
and get something going.

56:13.329 --> 56:15.623
Slow down Lazar,
give you some time.

56:15.664 --> 56:17.875
Oh, so I should just stay
here, like a good girl,

56:17.917 --> 56:20.419
while my hero saves the day?

56:20.461 --> 56:22.046
No.

56:22.088 --> 56:24.299
Your people need you
to stay alive,

56:24.340 --> 56:25.549
- right?
- Mm.

56:25.591 --> 56:28.469
Well, the best way to do
that is to wait here.

56:29.845 --> 56:31.973
I'm sorry.

56:32.014 --> 56:34.433
I'm just so used to
fighting for everything.

56:34.475 --> 56:37.270
Mm, yeah, I'm sensing that.

56:38.938 --> 56:41.774
Don't worry.
I'll be back soon.

58:03.522 --> 58:04.857
Damn it.

58:04.899 --> 58:06.734
I knew I should've
checked the bathroom first.

58:06.775 --> 58:10.321
Hey, it's been a long day.
We all make mistakes.

58:10.363 --> 58:12.573
Drop the piece and step back.

58:17.703 --> 58:21.374
(CHUCKLES) It's too late now,
but how did you know?

58:21.416 --> 58:24.085
Uh, I saw Lazar
coming out of your room.

58:24.126 --> 58:25.420
It's hard to argue
with that one.

58:25.461 --> 58:28.505
- Yeah.
- Sit down over there.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.091
Let's talk.

58:35.137 --> 58:36.555
Who do you work for?

58:36.597 --> 58:39.558
Probably no one after this.

58:39.600 --> 58:40.851
You guys hiring?

58:40.893 --> 58:42.853
I assume you give great dental.

58:42.895 --> 58:44.188
See, I got a cracking set.

58:44.230 --> 58:47.691
Yeah, you're a riot.
Who do you work for?

58:47.733 --> 58:48.901
Trans-global Digital.

58:48.943 --> 58:50.462
You know, they've
invested a lot of money

58:50.486 --> 58:52.280
bribing this current
administration.

58:52.321 --> 58:53.922
They'd really rather
not start over again

58:53.948 --> 58:55.116
from the beginning, you know?

58:56.784 --> 58:58.327
Why snoop around me?

58:59.620 --> 59:02.706
- Just nosey.
- No, there's more.

59:02.748 --> 59:04.708
Look, we blow your cover;

59:04.750 --> 59:07.544
We tell everyone that your
employers are financing the coup.

59:07.586 --> 59:09.380
That discredits Lazar.

59:09.422 --> 59:12.549
(CHUCKLES) I should just
turn you over to Lazar.

59:12.591 --> 59:14.718
But instead, I'm thinking,

59:14.760 --> 59:16.804
"Let's see
if we can make a deal."

59:16.845 --> 59:18.555
See, I'm trying to help you

59:18.597 --> 59:20.391
and all you're giving me
is lies.

59:20.433 --> 59:21.934
(CHUCKLES)
I'm telling the truth.

59:21.976 --> 59:23.328
You're not working
for Trans-global.

59:23.352 --> 59:24.996
Well, I hope they're paying
for my fucking room.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.605
You're not doing this
for Trans-global,

59:26.647 --> 59:28.399
because as soon
as this coup got started,

59:28.441 --> 59:30.651
I got on the horn
with them and checked.

59:30.692 --> 59:33.612

All right.

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:16.840
You'll be a little bit
more forthcoming

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:20.284
after a few weeks
in Lazar's prisons.

01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:23.204
What, you got Lazar
on speed dial?

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:24.830
I'm here freelancing,

01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:28.042
brokering deals between
Lazar and anyone else

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:30.145
who'll want in on the ground
floor once he takes charge.

01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:33.339
So, yeah, you could say
he takes my calls.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.553
I'm working for Vorza.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.182
And frankly?

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:47.186
I'm more scared of him
than I am of Lazar.

- Immunity.

Now who is the new puppet?

Why would she be
working with him?

Look, she turns a blind eye
to Vorza's corruption,

01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:44.488
Vorza's network keeps her
in power long enough

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.658
for her to make the transition
to democracy, right?

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:51.579
She's a true believer,
but she's pragmatic,

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:55.374
and Vorza is someone the
agency can cut a deal with.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.336

- The money from Mr. Gibbons.

with those guys,

but the headline is
he's blue list.

01:08:36.404 --> 01:08:39.033
- What is that?
- Blue list is for operatives

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.618
who were given
an indefinite kill ratio.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.328
Indefinite means
they don't know.

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:44.705
It means there's no upper limit.

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:46.497
Means he's extremely dangerous.

have, whatever firepower,
