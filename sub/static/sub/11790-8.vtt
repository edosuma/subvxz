10:04.330 --> 10:05.592
MRS. GRUBMAN?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.067
>> I DONT HAVE TIME TO EAT.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.264
ITS TOO MUCH WORK TO DO ON THIS

10:08.270 --> 10:10.272
FUNERAL. AND THE SEATING CHART

10:10.280 --> 10:12.931
ALONE IS TALKING ME 4 HOURS.

10:12.940 --> 10:13.975
BLAINE TRUMP IS GONNA NEED A

10:13.980 --> 10:16.130
SHOULDER TO CRY ON. WELL, ILL

>> YOURE GIVING UP, MRS.

10:21.650 --> 10:25.882
GRUBMAN. THAT ISNT LIKE YOU.

10:25.890 --> 10:28.916
>> I TOLD YOU, IVE HAD

10:28.920 --> 10:31.889
A WONDERFUL LIFE WITH ONLY 2

10:31.900 --> 10:36.018
REGRETS. THAT I DIDNT SLEEP

10:36.030 --> 10:39.295
WITH YOU WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE,

10:39.300 --> 10:40.938
AND THAT I NEVER GOT TO SING AT

10:40.940 --> 10:42.339
THE RAINBOW ROOM.

10:42.340 --> 10:45.104
>> THE RAINBOW ROOM.

10:45.110 --> 10:46.031
DONT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

10:46.040 --> 10:48.201
SING FOR THAT?

10:48.210 --> 10:50.178

11:04.060 --> 11:05.288
WONT BE THERE.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.178
>> YOU HAVE TO. YOURE SLATED TO

11:07.190 --> 11:08.987
SPEAK AFTER DOMINICK DUNNE.

11:08.990 --> 11:10.935
>> I WONT BE A PART OF THIS. IF

11:10.940 --> 11:11.861
YOU WANT TO STARVE YOURSELF TO

11:11.870 --> 11:12.996

13:15.060 --> 13:17.051
SEAN, IS WHAT ALL THIS INTENSITY

13:17.060 --> 13:18.084

13:20.070 --> 13:21.924
STRANGERS, IN FRONT OF ANNIE.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.124
ALL I KNEW IN THAT MOMENT, WAS

13:23.130 --> 13:24.199
THAT PEOPLE LIKE THEM WOULD BE

13:24.200 --> 13:25.269
TORMENTING MY SON FOR THE REST

OUTTA HERE!

14:51.460 --> 14:53.257
HES ROUNDING THIRD.

14:53.260 --> 14:57.219
ITS A RACE FOR THE PLATE.

14:57.220 --> 15:03.022
ITS A HOME RUN. HA HA. WHOO!

15:03.030 --> 15:04.429
>> WHEN CAN I SIGN UP FOR LITTLE

15:04.430 --> 15:05.988
LEAGUE, DAD?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.389
>> GEE, THANKS, BUDDY. I COME

15:08.400 --> 15:09.970

15:09.980 --> 15:11.902

15:11.910 --> 15:16.108
>> NO. I REALLY LIKE PLAYING

15:16.110 --> 15:18.328
DATES. I JUST WANNA PLAY A REAL

15:18.340 --> 15:19.898
GAME.

15:19.910 --> 15:24.313
>> YOU AND YOUR MOTHER. THE KIDS

15:24.320 --> 15:27.039
WILL LAUGH AT YOU. AND THE COACH

15:27.050 --> 15:28.017
WILL KEEP YOU ON THE BENCH AND

15:28.020 --> 15:30.329
THEN STICK YOU OUT IN RIGHT

15:30.330 --> 15:32.696
FIELD FOR THE LAST INNING. OH,

15:51.480 --> 15:55.473
THOMPSON? IM SORRY I HIT YOU.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.141
>> HA HA. I BET YOU ARE. THIS

15:57.150 --> 15:58.970
IS GOING TO COST YOU, MCNAMARA.

15:58.980 --> 16:00.254
I GOT 20 WITNESSES THATLL SWEAR

16:00.260 --> 16:01.955
TO WHAT THEY SAW.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.222
>> I NEVER SHOULD HAVE ERUPTED

16:03.230 --> 16:09.453
LIKE I DID. I JUST--MY SON IS

16:09.460 --> 16:10.734
ABOUT TO HAVE AN OPERATION ON

16:10.740 --> 16:12.298
HIS HANDS.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.733
>> YOU HUMILIATED ME IN FRONT OF

16:13.740 --> 16:18.359
MY BOY.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.359
>> LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO ARE

16:19.370 --> 16:21.406
WORKING TH ROUGH IT.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.401
>> YEAH. I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO HIM

16:23.410 --> 16:25.241
THAT WHAT I DID WAS WRONG, AND

16:25.250 --> 16:26.342
WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG, AND WHAT

16:26.350 --> 16:27.749
YOU DID WAS REALLY, REALLY

16:27.750 --> 16:30.116
WRONG. AND I THINK

16:30.120 --> 16:32.156
HE GETS IT NOW.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.049
>> WHAT POSITION DOES HE PLAY?

16:35.060 --> 16:37.255
>> SHORTSTOP. I MEAN, HES A

16:37.260 --> 16:38.158
LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE OTHER

16:38.160 --> 16:40.367
KIDS, BUT HE DID TURN A DOUBLE

16:40.370 --> 16:42.725
PLAY LAST NIGHT. IT WON THEM

16:42.730 --> 16:44.766
THE GAME.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.725
>> EVERY KID SHOULD HAVE A

16:45.730 --> 16:49.097
MOMENT LIKE THAT.

16:49.100 --> 16:54.402
WALK-OFF HOME RUN. [INDISTINCT]

16:54.410 --> 16:58.528
THATS ALL I WANT FOR CONOR.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.646
HE MAY NEVER GET THAT CHANCE.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.083
BUT ALL I WANT IS FOR HIM

17:03.090 --> 17:10.098
TO BE NORMAL.

17:10.100 --> 17:13.490
LOOK, DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO WITH

17:13.500 --> 17:16.025
THE LAWSUIT. I JUST WANT TO

17:16.030 --> 17:17.019
APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT

17:17.030 --> 17:21.239
I DID AND WHAT I SAID.

17:26.070 --> 17:27.367
>> THESE WEB FINGERS ARE KNOWN

17:27.370 --> 17:28.735
AS SYNDACTY LY. TH ERERE ACTUALLY

17:28.740 --> 17:30.776
2 FINGERS INSIDE HERE. WE DO

17:30.780 --> 17:33.078
A SYNDACTY LY RELEASE ON THE

17:33.080 --> 17:36.140
INDEX AND MIDDLE FINGER AND

17:36.150 --> 17:37.412
ANOTHER ONE BETWEEN THE RING AND

17:37.420 --> 17:38.170
THE PINKY.

17:38.180 --> 17:39.408
>> WHAT KIND OF COMPLICATIONS

17:39.420 --> 17:41.388
COULD ARISE?

17:41.390 --> 17:43.358
>> OH, IM SO SORRY IM LATE.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.225
THERE WAS THIS ACCIDENT ON THE

17:45.230 --> 17:45.821
CAUSEWAY.

17:45.830 --> 17:47.320
>> MARLOS GONNA BE INVOLVED IN

17:47.330 --> 17:49.150
CONORS CARE, SO I ASKED HIM

17:49.160 --> 17:50.331
TO JOIN US.

17:50.340 --> 17:51.466
>> IM SORRY. DONT MIND ME.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.462
PLEASE CONTINUE.

17:54.470 --> 18:03.447
>> UM, LET ME GET YOU A CHAIR.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.099
>> WELL, THE MAIN COMPLICATION

18:05.110 --> 18:06.475
THAT COULD ARISE IS THAT THE

18:06.480 --> 18:08.209
VESSEL OF THE NERVE COULD BE

18:08.210 --> 18:09.404
DAMAGED IN THE PROCESS.

18:09.410 --> 18:10.354
>> WILL YOU HAVE TO DO A SKIN

18:10.360 --> 18:11.213
GRAFT?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.255
>> THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES,

18:12.260 --> 18:13.113
JULI--

18:13.120 --> 18:14.155
>> INSTEAD OF AN INVASIVE

18:14.160 --> 18:15.354
PROCEDURE, WILL THERE BE A LOT

18:15.360 --> 18:16.110
OF PAIN?

18:16.120 --> 18:17.849
>> HELL BE UNDER ANESTHESIA.

18:17.860 --> 18:18.713
>> I WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS

18:18.720 --> 18:19.812
RECOVERY.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.822
>> UM, WERE PRETTY GOOD WITH

18:21.830 --> 18:24.162
PAIN MANAGEMENT.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.365
>> WHICH BRINGS US TO THE THUMB

18:26.370 --> 18:29.294
DISTRACT ION. WE PLAN TO TURN

18:29.300 --> 18:31.507
THIS SMALL SUGGESTION OF A DIGIT

18:31.510 --> 18:34.138
INTO A REAL THUMB. WE MAKE AN

18:34.140 --> 18:35.471
INCISION IN THE THUMB, DISSECT

18:35.480 --> 18:37.368
THE BONE, AND APPLY DISTRACT ION

18:37.380 --> 18:38.836
OSTEOGENESIS DEVICE. IT HAS

18:38.840 --> 18:40.387
LITTLE PINS AND SCREWS THAT GO

18:40.390 --> 18:42.779
INTO THE BONE. WE SEW THE THUMB

18:42.790 --> 18:44.382
BACK UP AND OVER THE NEXT WEEKS,

18:44.390 --> 18:46.244
WE SLOWLY TURN THE SCREWS, AND

18:46.250 --> 18:48.741
THEY BASICALLY STRETCH THE BONE.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.729
>> WHO TURNS THESE SCREWS OVER

18:50.730 --> 18:52.357
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS?

18:52.360 --> 18:53.759
>> YOU DO. WE FIND THAT THE PAIN

18:53.760 --> 18:54.795
LEVEL IS MINIMAL TO NEXT TO

18:54.800 --> 18:55.789
NOTHING WHEN THE PARENTS ARE THE

18:55.800 --> 18:56.755
ONES THAT TURN THEM.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.749
>> HOW DO YOU MEASURE THOSE PAIN

18:57.760 --> 18:59.523
LEVELS IF I MAY ASK?

18:59.530 --> 19:00.667
>> OH, WE DOCTORS, WEVE GOT

19:00.670 --> 19:01.602
ALL KINDS OF TRICKS UP OUR

19:01.610 --> 19:02.360
SLEEVES.

19:02.370 --> 19:03.268
>> THAT WAS A REASONABLE

19:03.270 --> 19:04.430
QUESTION, CHRISTIAN.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.509
>> WELL, IM ONLY ASKING,

19:05.510 --> 19:06.363
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE

19:06.370 --> 19:07.667
RESEARCH IVE BEEN READING, THE

19:07.670 --> 19:09.399
TRADITIONAL WAYS OF MEASURING

19:09.410 --> 19:11.549
INFANT PAIN, TEARS, AND BRAIN

19:11.550 --> 19:13.518
ACTIVITY, ITS JUST NOT AS

19:13.520 --> 19:14.714
CONCLUSIVE AS WE WISH IT WAS.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.812
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF THE

19:15.820 --> 19:17.412
EXPERTISE, MASTERING, AND

19:17.420 --> 19:18.375
PROFESSIONAL STATUS THATS

19:18.380 --> 19:20.382
GATHERED IN THIS ROOM?

19:20.390 --> 19:21.789
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, JULIA

19:21.790 --> 19:23.326
ASKED ME TO BE HERE TODAY TO

19:23.330 --> 19:24.820
BRING UP SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.785
IN OTHER WORDS, IM DOING MY

19:25.790 --> 19:28.520
JOB. IM SORRY IF THAT KNOCKS

19:28.530 --> 19:32.762
ANYONES NOSE OUT OF JOINT.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.465
>> SO, WHAT IS THIS RESEARCH,

19:34.470 --> 19:35.539
MARLO?

19:35.540 --> 19:36.689
>> SOME WELL-RESPECT ED

19:36.700 --> 19:38.429
DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE

19:38.440 --> 19:39.737
DONE HYPNOSIS ON A PRETTY LARGE

19:39.740 --> 19:40.707
GROUP OF ADULTS WHO HAD SURGERY

19:40.710 --> 19:43.304
AT AN EARLY AGE. THEY ALL TEND

19:43.310 --> 19:44.538
TO HAVE SIMILAR SYMPTOMS.

19:44.550 --> 19:45.869
NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS,

19:47.850 --> 19:49.875
PHOBIA, AND PANIC ATTACKS.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.689
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS, SEAN?

19:51.690 --> 19:52.782
>> I SCHEDULED THIS MEETING SO

19:54.520 --> 19:55.782
ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

19:55.790 --> 19:57.610
SURGERY. I THINK THE WHOLE NEW

19:57.620 --> 19:59.451
AGE-HEALING MODALITY TYPE OF

19:59.460 --> 20:00.927
