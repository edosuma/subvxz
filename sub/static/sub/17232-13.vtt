WEBVTT

00:02.188 --> 00:03.672
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.673 --> 00:05.991
What the hell are you doing here?
Came to pick up my big brother.

00:05.992 --> 00:08.875
What the hell is wrong with you?
That's a violation of parole.

00:08.876 --> 00:11.232
You need sleep, and I need a roommate.
I don't know.

00:11.233 --> 00:12.394
You don't lie to your partner.

00:12.395 --> 00:14.673
The whole reason you have a
career again is because of me.

00:14.674 --> 00:16.422
This partnership is dissolved.

00:16.423 --> 00:19.108
I remember what it feels
like to lie here like this.

00:19.109 --> 00:21.771
What in the hell are you
doing on this tour?

00:23.052 --> 00:24.518
We're done talkin'.

00:26.584 --> 00:27.744
Can I come in?

00:28.800 --> 00:30.319
I want a divorce.

00:34.323 --> 00:35.408
Rayna has this interview,

00:35.409 --> 00:37.729
then one more, and you're
finished with the junket.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.727
Great. Let me see how she's doing.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.434
We're all set up.

00:44.782 --> 00:46.783
I want a divorce. Divorce...

00:47.219 --> 00:50.248
Rayna, you ready for all this? Rayna?

00:50.505 --> 00:51.710
You ready for all this?

00:54.344 --> 00:55.519
All right.

00:57.309 --> 00:58.540
Thanks, ladies.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.745
Give us just one second, guys. Thanks.

01:03.904 --> 01:06.065
Look, ray, all these are
just puff piece interviews

01:06.066 --> 01:08.114
for the tour, okay? People get sick...

01:08.115 --> 01:09.859
yeah, I know. If you want
me to, I could just...

01:09.860 --> 01:13.622
no. I mean, I didn't make it
this far folding up like a tent

01:13.623 --> 01:15.151
when things get bad.

01:16.063 --> 01:17.734
This is a little different, ray.

01:17.999 --> 01:19.172
I'm fine.

01:19.857 --> 01:21.056
Always am.

01:21.853 --> 01:23.362
Okay. Let's do this.

01:24.860 --> 01:26.122
Okay.

01:26.184 --> 01:29.756
First up, we have Melissa Mirch
from the "Atlanta times."

01:29.757 --> 01:31.594
This is gonna stay the same,
and I want them to build

01:31.595 --> 01:33.743
a big runway that goes into the audience

01:33.744 --> 01:36.544
for the acoustic set just
wide enough for Deacon and I.

01:36.545 --> 01:37.743
Acoustic set? Yeah.

01:37.744 --> 01:39.285
Now wait a second. Let's talk about this.

01:39.286 --> 01:40.416
We are talking about it.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.283
Just call whoever and make it happen.

01:44.129 --> 01:45.613
Look, "consider me" got some nice attention

01:45.614 --> 01:49.056
at the last concert, but now I'm
hearing new sets, new lighting.

01:49.057 --> 01:50.041
I thought we agreed that you weren't

01:50.042 --> 01:52.252
gonna make any decisions
without discussing it with me.

01:52.253 --> 01:54.047
By "discuss," you mean ask permission.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.503
No, that's not what I meant. Yes.

01:55.504 --> 01:56.737
But, you know, you did promise to behave...

01:56.738 --> 01:58.894
Behave? After the shoplifting,
the scandals, the wedding thing.

01:58.895 --> 02:01.634
Behave? This is my damn career.

02:01.635 --> 02:03.227
And I'm trying to save
you from wrecking it.

02:03.228 --> 02:05.254
No, you are trying to run my life.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.486
I am a multi-million dollar industry,

02:07.487 --> 02:09.473
and it is about time that
I took control of it.

02:09.473 --> 02:11.968
 so I'm gonna keep writing my
songs the way I wanna write 'em,

02:11.969 --> 02:13.812
And you keep writing the checks.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.735 --> 02:24.338
Yeah. Someone is trying
to get ahold of you.

02:24.339 --> 02:27.144
It's a 5-1-2 number that's
called about 3 times.

02:28.061 --> 02:30.002
Wanna make a rule about
nakedness around here?

02:30.133 --> 02:31.759
Sorry. I like to air dry.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.803
But I can be naked if you want me to be.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.867
No, thank you. Strictly... roommates.

02:37.537 --> 02:38.599
Who's that?

02:38.949 --> 02:40.443
I don't recognize the number.

02:41.029 --> 02:43.188
Besides if, uh, we're strictly roommates,

02:43.189 --> 02:44.507
why do you even care?

02:45.011 --> 02:46.534
Naked smart-ass.

02:50.392 --> 02:51.345
Hello?

02:52.430 --> 02:56.047
It's Watty white. Come here.

02:56.701 --> 02:59.970
Yeah. Absolutely, sir.

03:03.066 --> 03:04.118
Thank you.

03:04.596 --> 03:05.594
Bye.

03:06.505 --> 03:07.794
What? What, what, what?

03:07.795 --> 03:09.914
That was Watty white. Yeah, you... you...

03:09.915 --> 03:11.581
you already said that. What? What'd he say?

03:11.582 --> 03:13.997
Well, Rayna Jaymes listened to our demo.

03:14.287 --> 03:14.847
Get out.

03:14.848 --> 03:16.758
She's created her own record label.

03:16.759 --> 03:19.002
She wants to talk about signing us.

03:23.731 --> 03:25.509
Oh, okay, losing towel.

03:28.137 --> 03:29.449
Sure you wanna leave for the arena?

03:29.450 --> 03:30.360
Sound check's not till 3:00.

03:30.361 --> 03:33.052
No, yeah, I just wanna get there
and get outta here, you know?

03:33.053 --> 03:34.642
I gotta focus on what I'm doing here.

03:34.643 --> 03:35.820
Whatever works.

03:36.655 --> 03:38.406
Are you kidding me?

03:38.887 --> 03:40.327
Just ignore him.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.838
Too late.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.800
Oh, wow. Hi. Hi.

03:49.976 --> 03:51.823
What, are you, uh, stalking me?

03:51.824 --> 03:53.822
I'm working here. You might've heard.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.226
Yeah, well, me, too.

03:55.990 --> 03:57.221
Not on my show.

03:58.092 --> 04:00.055
Guess I'm still fired. Yeah.

04:01.190 --> 04:03.876
I'm actually producing a band
that's based outta here.

04:04.415 --> 04:05.993
Interesting coincidence.

04:08.268 --> 04:10.278
If you'll excuse me, my guys are here.

04:10.279 --> 04:11.294
Hi.

04:12.923 --> 04:14.632
Don't let him get under your skin, okay?

04:14.633 --> 04:16.077
Oh, please, that person

04:16.077 --> 04:18.779
is the least of my problems right now.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.377
So inauguration plans... they look good.

04:21.464 --> 04:23.749
They're kinda subdued.
Well, I think it's best

04:23.750 --> 04:26.569
not to overspend before
setting foot into office.

04:27.251 --> 04:29.027
So is Rayna flying in for this?

04:29.028 --> 04:30.244
If she can.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.659
By the way, daddy has a few thoughts

04:32.660 --> 04:35.016
on who your next deputy mayor should be.

04:35.193 --> 04:36.493
I'm sure he does.

04:40.021 --> 04:41.034
Thank you.

04:41.035 --> 04:42.624
Oh. Here you go.

04:47.297 --> 04:48.400
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:48.401 --> 04:51.484
Hey. Please tell me that you
are not still in contact

04:51.485 --> 04:52.185
with that woman.

04:52.186 --> 04:54.596
Okay, look, let's just get
something straight right now.

04:54.657 --> 04:55.690
None of this...

04:55.691 --> 04:57.636
not whom I appoint or who I
talk to over the phone...

04:57.637 --> 04:59.484
is your or your father's business.

04:59.485 --> 05:00.465
Okay?

05:09.797 --> 05:12.121
You were the one who rushed into
this deal with dinic. Yeah, I know.

05:12.122 --> 05:14.272
I warned you, he's very controlling.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.644
I don't know how much
more I can take of this,

05:15.645 --> 05:16.988
'cause I'm not feeling the direction

05:16.989 --> 05:18.722
he's taking the album in.

05:18.804 --> 05:20.207
Have you talked to him about it?

05:20.208 --> 05:22.235
I would if I could. He's in L.A.

05:22.236 --> 05:24.008
He only texts me with
his fixes on the cuts.

05:24.009 --> 05:24.541
And you know what else?

05:24.542 --> 05:26.890
I haven't seen a dollar since I started.

05:26.982 --> 05:29.123
Nobody said you had to stay
in this motel. I know.

05:29.124 --> 05:31.523
Your... door's always open.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.403
Look, the point is,

05:33.540 --> 05:35.525
I shouldn't be living like this at all.

05:35.694 --> 05:36.777
I know.

05:37.733 --> 05:40.584
No artist wants to be patient,
but you know this business.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.086
It'll pay off in the long run.
In the meantime,

05:43.472 --> 05:44.838
find yourself someplace decent to stay.

05:44.839 --> 05:46.288
I'll spot you the cash.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.941
I thought I taught you how to
do sound better than that.

06:02.553 --> 06:03.824
What the hell you doing here?

06:04.548 --> 06:06.033
Thought you went back to Texas.

06:06.256 --> 06:07.810
Ain't you glad to see me?

06:08.277 --> 06:09.541
Look at this place. You're
doing all right, huh?

06:09.542 --> 06:12.248
How'd you get in here? Well,
the gal at the front door...

06:12.249 --> 06:13.653
I told her you and me go way back,

06:13.654 --> 06:15.605
even used to play together.

06:18.062 --> 06:19.646
Look, we're opening up right now,

06:20.374 --> 06:23.300
so you come here, and you
sit right on that stool.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.726
You don't talk to anybody, all right?
Not a word.

06:25.727 --> 06:26.826
That's cool.

06:33.638 --> 06:34.595
Hey.

06:34.814 --> 06:36.231
Hey, I was, uh,

06:36.262 --> 06:37.791
I was just checking in with you.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.967
How are the girls? They're good.
They're good.

06:39.968 --> 06:41.202
Daphne finished her science project.

06:41.203 --> 06:43.489
I know. She sent me a picture. Looks great.

06:43.912 --> 06:44.725
How's Maddie?

06:44.726 --> 06:47.021
She's excellent. Scored a goal in soccer,

06:47.022 --> 06:48.350
happy as a clam.

06:49.233 --> 06:50.655
So, look, I, um...

06:51.458 --> 06:53.036
Cleared the decks for tomorrow,

06:53.037 --> 06:54.259
canceled the girls' dance classes

06:54.260 --> 06:55.918
so they're both gonna be
home right after school,

06:55.919 --> 06:57.046
so you and I can, you know,

06:57.047 --> 06:58.547
tell them together about... wait a minute.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.288
I'd like to have a conversation first

07:00.289 --> 07:01.422
about how we're gonna do this.

07:01.423 --> 07:02.577
Kids pick up on these things.
Why do we just have to

07:02.578 --> 07:03.678
 dump it on 'em the minute
I walk in the front door?

07:03.679 --> 07:05.099
 because the longer we wait,

07:05.100 --> 07:06.386
the more likely something might leak...

07:06.387 --> 07:08.762
why is something gonna leak?
I haven't said anything.

07:08.763 --> 07:09.611
I haven't filed. Have you filed?

07:09.612 --> 07:11.870
Because... because we're
public figures right now.

07:11.871 --> 07:14.607
I'm well aware that we're public figures.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.891
I'm about to go out onstage right now.

07:16.892 --> 07:19.202
This is really not good
timing to be doing this.

07:19.824 --> 07:21.238
Hey, is that mom? Yeah.

07:21.239 --> 07:22.533
Can I talk to her? I wanna say hi to mom.

07:22.534 --> 07:23.622
Yeah. Can I talk to her, please?

07:23.623 --> 07:25.099
Can I talk to her, please?
Girls wanna talk to you.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.559
- I miss you so much.
- Hi, mom.

07:27.497 --> 07:30.276
Hi, babies. Hi! I miss you so much, too.

07:30.277 --> 07:31.626
I miss you the most.

07:31.627 --> 07:32.880
2-minute warning!

07:33.071 --> 07:34.969
Hey, girls, I'm about to go out onstage,

07:34.970 --> 07:38.133
but I'm so excited to see you tomorrow.
I love you so much.

07:38.134 --> 07:40.125
Okay, bye, mom. I-I wanna talk to her.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.765
We can't wait for you to get home.

07:41.993 --> 07:44.287
Okay, love you so much. Bye. Love you, too.

07:44.288 --> 07:45.366
Bye.

07:55.703 --> 07:57.502
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:57.503 --> 07:59.741
9-time grammy winner,

07:59.742 --> 08:02.190

08:24.671 --> 08:25.751

08:26.020 --> 08:27.630
No. Something's wrong.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.245
What?

08:31.740 --> 08:33.356

Hey! Great show, ray.

09:57.003 --> 09:58.103
Yeah, I don't... I don't
think anybody noticed

09:58.104 --> 09:59.754
that little hiccup at the top.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.153
Are you okay? Yeah.

10:03.239 --> 10:05.233
You brought me flowers? Yes.

10:05.363 --> 10:06.723
What am I gonna do with this?

10:06.724 --> 10:08.883
Yeah, okay, I'll... I'll find a vase.

10:09.381 --> 10:11.726
Well, well, well.

10:11.752 --> 10:14.039
Look who shows up when
I don't have my rifle.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.222
It was a hell of a show.

10:18.223 --> 10:19.819
Thank you. I'm sure you could use this.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.325
What's that supposed to mean?

10:22.044 --> 10:24.196
No agenda. Cheers.

10:24.197 --> 10:25.102
A votre sante.

10:25.103 --> 10:26.232
Great show!

10:26.233 --> 10:28.681
Absolutely, everybody! Whoo!

10:28.682 --> 10:30.296
That's how we do it!

10:30.361 --> 10:32.909
I appreciate it and I
appreciate the hard work.

10:32.910 --> 10:34.757
And you guys are family to me, honestly,

10:34.758 --> 10:36.375
and I like to share with family,

10:36.376 --> 10:39.013
so I wanna share with y'all some good news.

10:39.014 --> 10:43.616
The reaction to the new
material has been outstanding.

10:43.617 --> 10:45.013
Unbelievable.

10:45.622 --> 10:48.126
And so much so that it's inspired me

10:48.127 --> 10:51.318
to do a little revamping
of the rest of the tour.

10:51.319 --> 10:53.985
So... I've come up with some new ideas

10:53.986 --> 10:55.448
that are gonna help us get away from

10:55.449 --> 10:57.783
the more juvenile aspects of the show.

10:57.784 --> 10:58.603
And for those of y'all

10:58.604 --> 11:00.627
who have been with me since the beginning,

11:00.707 --> 11:02.433
it's about damn time, right?

11:05.815 --> 11:07.498
What are you thinking, just
showing up here like that?

11:07.499 --> 11:08.185
Well, I tried calling,

11:08.186 --> 11:09.851
but... I thought you're
supposed to be back in Texas.

11:09.852 --> 11:11.716
I mean, I got your parole
officer calling me.

11:11.717 --> 11:12.963
What'd you tell him?

11:13.497 --> 11:15.606
Nothin'. And I don't know why.

11:15.607 --> 11:16.627
Last time I saw you,

11:16.628 --> 11:18.776
you stole my Gibson and bartered it for...

11:18.777 --> 11:20.568
for a gun, which you
better not have on you.

11:20.569 --> 11:21.624
You got your guitar back, right?

11:21.625 --> 11:23.542
Yeah, and w-what about
finishing your time, huh?

11:23.543 --> 11:25.575
I can't stay in Austin. I can't
stay in some halfway house!

11:25.576 --> 11:26.821
Too many people I got bad blood with.

11:26.822 --> 11:29.490
That's why I got the gun.
That's why I left.

11:29.491 --> 11:31.459
But then I-I got to thinking about you

11:31.460 --> 11:33.693
and how music gave you this life.

11:34.718 --> 11:36.427
I'm here. I got rid of the gun.

11:36.428 --> 11:37.400
Well, and I'm supposed to believe that?

11:37.401 --> 11:40.148
It's the truth. I-I want a second chance.

11:40.986 --> 11:42.351
Mostly, I just want a second chance

11:42.352 --> 11:43.786
with my baby brother.

11:51.785 --> 11:54.053
Don't think I've seen you
freeze up like that before.

11:54.054 --> 11:55.064
Just... well...

11:55.065 --> 11:56.935
What happened? Nothing. I'm fine.

12:00.878 --> 12:02.486
I know when you're fine. You're not fine.

12:02.487 --> 12:04.115
I'm fine. Mm.

12:04.418 --> 12:06.041
Look, if this is about...

12:06.167 --> 12:07.927
The elevator or all that, I'm sorry.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.213
It's not about that. It's really not.

12:10.214 --> 12:11.761
There's a lot going on right now,

12:11.762 --> 12:13.377
and I really wanna talk to you about it.

12:13.378 --> 12:14.925
But right now I can't even...

12:16.536 --> 12:17.755
Think about it...

12:19.624 --> 12:20.615
Or else I'm just gonna lose it,

12:20.616 --> 12:23.437
and I'm... not gonna lose it right now.

12:23.945 --> 12:24.964
When you're ready.

12:33.865 --> 12:34.581
Hello? Hey.

12:34.582 --> 12:36.674
I haven't heard from you in over two weeks.

12:36.675 --> 12:38.088
I saw your husband earlier,

12:38.089 --> 12:40.881
and I could tell that
something's not all right.

12:40.882 --> 12:43.158
Well, he's probably just busy
jumping through all the hoops

12:43.159 --> 12:45.178
that you and daddy set up
for him, so you just...

12:45.179 --> 12:47.054
don't you worry your pretty
little head about it.

12:47.055 --> 12:48.774
Sweetheart, please.

12:48.871 --> 12:51.918
I just... I just wanna make sure
that you're all right. That's all.

12:51.919 --> 12:54.099
I am fine, honey. I'm fine. You know what?
I gotta go.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.114
I'm right in the middle over here,

12:55.115 --> 12:56.975
so I'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.

12:57.820 --> 12:58.990
That was a great show.

12:58.991 --> 13:01.389
Right? That was unbelievable.

13:01.390 --> 13:04.180
And the fans... they were
with me the whole time,

13:04.295 --> 13:05.757
every step.

13:06.093 --> 13:09.419
I'm telling you, if every
show is like this,

13:09.420 --> 13:11.702
I'd go on tour forever and never come back.

13:11.703 --> 13:14.194
By the way, your mom called.

13:14.195 --> 13:16.127
She gets out of rehab next week.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.915
You decide where you want her to live?

13:17.916 --> 13:18.507
You know what?

13:18.508 --> 13:20.491
I have been so busy making
changes to the tour,

13:20.492 --> 13:21.926
I totally forgot.

13:22.274 --> 13:23.811
You know, why don't you decide?

13:24.570 --> 13:25.923
Are you sure? Yeah.

13:25.924 --> 13:28.110
You found me the place I live in now.

13:28.163 --> 13:32.678
Just look for somewhere with
a nice view and a doorman...

13:32.679 --> 13:34.941
At least 10 Miles away from me, please.

13:34.942 --> 13:36.393
Well, that was quite a
show you put on tonight.

13:36.394 --> 13:38.234
My best performance yet, I think.

13:38.825 --> 13:40.806
I'm talking about your
impromptu crew meeting.

13:40.807 --> 13:42.383
Emily, give us a second, will you?

13:42.768 --> 13:44.398
No, Emily, you can stay.

13:46.988 --> 13:47.640
Really?

13:47.641 --> 13:51.076
I mean, you want me to say I'm
fine with all this craziness?

13:52.054 --> 13:53.107
No.

13:54.825 --> 13:56.746
I want you to say, "yes, ma'am."

14:04.926 --> 14:07.601
What's wrong? There's too
many people fawning over ya?

14:07.602 --> 14:09.643
Worrying about me is more like it.

14:09.644 --> 14:11.300
They don't know how tough you are?

14:11.301 --> 14:12.680
Apparently not.

14:13.659 --> 14:14.880
You do, I suppose.

14:14.881 --> 14:16.659
I have my suspicions.

14:16.724 --> 14:19.128
Look, I know there's a lot on your mind.

14:19.321 --> 14:21.726
I don't really need to hear
what your problems are,

14:22.641 --> 14:23.838
but I might have a solution.

14:23.839 --> 14:25.825
What might that be? Three things...

14:26.322 --> 14:28.663
drink more, dance...

14:30.970 --> 14:33.128
What's the third one? I don't know.

14:33.129 --> 14:34.666
Just gotta get away from your life,

14:34.667 --> 14:36.343
even if it's just for one night.

14:43.214 --> 14:45.136
Sold. Come on.

14:45.959 --> 14:47.095
Bye, y'all.

14:53.946 --> 14:55.072
Don't eat it all.

14:55.073 --> 14:56.785
I don't have that much to write. Relax.

14:56.786 --> 14:58.421
Oh, something smells good.

14:58.422 --> 14:59.683
Daddy, daddy, daddy! Daddy,
daddy, daddy, daddy!

14:59.684 --> 15:01.537
What-Ty? What-Ty? What-Ty?
What-Ty? What-Ty?

15:01.742 --> 15:03.054
Look at the cake that we made for mom.

15:03.055 --> 15:04.519
A cake? It's awesome.

15:05.335 --> 15:07.460
Wow! Look at that.

15:07.461 --> 15:08.617
Chocolate. My favorite.

15:08.618 --> 15:10.980
And vanilla in the inside.
Yeah, that's mommy's favorite.

15:10.981 --> 15:11.990
Yep. Mmm!

15:11.991 --> 15:14.920
Except "welcome home" is two words.

15:15.036 --> 15:16.143
What grade are you in, anyway?

15:16.144 --> 15:18.129
Oh, my gosh! I wanted it to be perfect!

15:18.130 --> 15:20.422
Mm, honey, it's okay. It is perfect.

15:20.423 --> 15:22.057
And your mom is gonna love it.

15:22.284 --> 15:23.365
She is.

15:23.431 --> 15:24.800
I could try to fix it.

15:25.198 --> 15:25.996
And what are you gonna do?

15:25.997 --> 15:27.633
Well, I can put the dash between
the "welcome" and "home."

15:27.634 --> 15:29.936
How about, like, if I, like, eat it? Yeah!

15:29.937 --> 15:31.283
Eat what? The middle...

15:31.284 --> 15:33.980
Like when... with the "M," make it smaller.

15:40.389 --> 15:41.500
Look, are you hearing that?

15:41.501 --> 15:43.674
Is he still there? Is
he still on the phone?

15:43.717 --> 15:45.758
Can you out him on speaker for me?

15:46.375 --> 15:48.405
Yo, yo, yo! I'm still here.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.809
I can't sing it. Trust me, bro.

15:50.810 --> 15:52.241
You sing it, I'm gonna
make the world hear it.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.534
Dominic, I do trust you,
but you've got me reaching

15:54.535 --> 15:56.825
for something that's just...
that's just not me.

15:56.826 --> 15:58.403
Exactly. Out of your comfort zone.

15:58.404 --> 16:00.493
No, you're not... you're not hearing me.

16:00.494 --> 16:04.795
I hear you and I love you, but do it.
Do it, my man.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.365
I gotta run. Later.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.900
You know, I need a minute.

16:12.213 --> 16:13.172
Avery.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.129
Hailey.

16:14.130 --> 16:15.565
Right. Yeah, you called.

16:15.566 --> 16:17.195
Yeah, I know we kind of left it open-ended.

16:17.196 --> 16:18.590
I hope you don't mind me
crashing your session.

16:18.591 --> 16:21.144
No. No, I get it. But like I told you,

16:21.145 --> 16:24.020
I'm in no position to give
up control of my publishing.

16:24.021 --> 16:25.222
Well, you wouldn't have to.

16:25.223 --> 16:27.308
It's a co-pub deal. It's 50/50.

16:27.405 --> 16:29.874
There's a good chance of a
6-figure advance on signing.

16:30.763 --> 16:31.742
Look, I wouldn't be here

16:31.743 --> 16:33.717
if I wasn't passionate about your material.

16:35.221 --> 16:37.347
I appreciate the offer. I really do.

16:37.348 --> 16:40.432
But... I'd have to run all
this by my manager anyway.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.324
Of course, but I wouldn't be doing my job

16:43.325 --> 16:45.939
if I didn't demand equal time, right?

16:47.245 --> 16:48.444
Over drinks?

16:51.409 --> 16:52.446
Hi.

16:52.822 --> 16:54.306
It's good to hear your voice.

16:55.689 --> 16:56.811
I, uh...

16:57.715 --> 16:59.855
I'm sorry that, um, we
haven't had the chance

16:59.856 --> 17:00.932
to talk since... look,

17:00.933 --> 17:03.379
if you're gonna say that we
can't see each other again,

17:03.380 --> 17:06.469
I-I-I get it. I asked Rayna for a divorce.

17:08.590 --> 17:09.858
I-I didn't see the point

17:09.858 --> 17:11.526
in pretending any longer.

17:11.767 --> 17:12.755
That...

17:13.744 --> 17:15.251
That must've been hard.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.204
Yeah. I'm sorry.

17:17.997 --> 17:19.137
It's okay.

17:20.301 --> 17:22.002
She's coming home tomorrow, and...

17:22.002 --> 17:23.623
We're supposed to tell the kids.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.508
W-what... what can I do?

17:25.509 --> 17:26.608
I don't know.

17:26.984 --> 17:28.536
Talk to me, I guess,

17:28.945 --> 17:31.057
since I'm not gonna be able
to see you for a while.

17:31.325 --> 17:33.715
Dad! Daphne broke another bowl! No!

17:35.644 --> 17:39.010
Dad? Trust me, I wish it
didn't have to be this way.

17:39.635 --> 17:40.827
I miss you.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.319
Sometimes I wonder what would've happened

17:43.320 --> 17:46.088
if we'd just stayed together way back then.

17:46.089 --> 17:47.217
Yeah, I've...

17:48.143 --> 17:49.705
I've been thinking the same thing.

17:50.289 --> 17:53.193
It just... it just feels
right being with you.

17:53.194 --> 17:54.663
I mean, honestly, Peggy, it's the only time

17:54.664 --> 17:57.402
I really feel like myself anymore.

18:13.737 --> 18:15.092
So are we just gonna drink all night

18:15.093 --> 18:16.188
or are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

18:16.189 --> 18:18.568
I thought you said you didn't
want to hear my problems.

18:19.278 --> 18:20.395
I lied.

18:22.859 --> 18:24.401
You know what I like about you?

18:25.234 --> 18:25.991
What?

18:25.992 --> 18:28.204
You don't know a damn thing about me.

18:28.205 --> 18:30.081
Oh. Yeah, well, I know...

18:30.082 --> 18:31.795
I know you're gettin' drunk.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.322
I'm not drunk. Nah, you're not drunk.

18:35.983 --> 18:38.535
Oh! I... come here.

18:38.536 --> 18:40.224
What? Come on, we're gonna dance.

18:40.225 --> 18:41.827
Oh, no. I'm... I'm not dancing to this.

18:41.828 --> 18:43.421
You are. Yes, you are. No.

18:43.422 --> 18:44.392
To this? Are you kiddin' me?

18:44.393 --> 18:45.995
You should've kept the
cowboy boots I gave you,

18:45.996 --> 18:46.894
but you didn't.

18:46.895 --> 18:48.218
This is the two-step.

18:48.219 --> 18:50.572
This is the easiest dance
in the whole entire world.

18:51.455 --> 18:52.768
Hold tight. Okay.

18:52.769 --> 18:55.614
It's quick, quick, slow. Watch
these people. You ready?

19:03.477 --> 19:05.667
So you're leading? At the moment, I am.

19:08.064 --> 19:08.821
Everybody here?

19:08.822 --> 19:11.151
Uh, yeah. All except Deacon.

19:11.169 --> 19:13.523
Right. Okay. Well, let's bring 'em in.
Let's get it done.

19:13.649 --> 19:15.904
Ladies and gentlemen,
can we gather, please?

19:16.012 --> 19:17.040
Come on in.

19:18.633 --> 19:19.555
Okay.

19:19.983 --> 19:21.885
I took a look at Juliette's
department suggestions

19:21.886 --> 19:23.652
for the back half of our tour.

19:23.653 --> 19:24.861
"Suggestions"?

19:24.884 --> 19:27.304
Well... let's call 'em that for now.

19:27.385 --> 19:28.797
Wait, wait, wait. So you're
saying disregard them?

19:28.798 --> 19:30.059
No, no. No, no, not at all.

19:30.060 --> 19:32.710
What I'm saying is, you're
gonna come to me first.

19:32.711 --> 19:33.710
Got it?

19:33.711 --> 19:35.369
Before I spend a dime on any of this stuff.

19:35.370 --> 19:38.318
But what if she asks? I'll handle it. Okay?

19:38.347 --> 19:38.988
Thanks, guys.

19:38.989 --> 19:41.142
Thanks, everybody. Back to
whatever you were doing.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.483
Is that man over there your brother?

19:48.829 --> 19:50.183
Hmm? Which man?

19:50.448 --> 19:52.696
The man you were talking
to for ages outside,

19:52.697 --> 19:55.797
with an Austin t-shirt on.
Austin is 5-1-2, yeah?

19:56.363 --> 19:57.005
Yeah.

19:57.006 --> 19:59.015
It's Jason. I was... I
was gonna tell you he...

19:59.016 --> 20:01.918
what, Jason who just got
out of prison... Jason?

20:01.919 --> 20:02.932
'Cause last time I checked,

20:02.933 --> 20:05.516
unless Texas has a different
a law to everybody else,

20:05.517 --> 20:07.769
he's not supposed to be
crossing state lines.

20:08.599 --> 20:09.476
Listen.

20:10.321 --> 20:11.615
He just needs a couple days, a...

20:11.616 --> 20:13.654
A couch to crash on while
he figures some stuff out.

20:13.655 --> 20:15.261
And that's called harboring
a fugitive. Nope.

20:15.517 --> 20:17.073
He's not a fugitive, all right?

20:18.971 --> 20:20.935
Fine. He violated parole, but
that ain't the same thing.

20:22.448 --> 20:23.728
All right, it is the same thing.

20:24.485 --> 20:26.460
It's complicated. He
couldn't go back to Austin,

20:26.634 --> 20:27.841
and it's not like he
hasn't served his time.

20:27.842 --> 20:29.709
Go over there, for the
good of all three of us,

20:29.710 --> 20:32.632
and tell him to get his ass back
to Texas and finish his parole,

20:32.633 --> 20:33.582
do whatever he's got to do

20:33.583 --> 20:35.106
so he's not staying on our couch.

20:41.339 --> 20:42.173
Hey, Glenn!

20:43.812 --> 20:44.726
Glenn!

20:45.220 --> 20:46.879
Hey, was there some sort
of crew call I missed?

20:46.880 --> 20:47.614
'Cause somebody told me

20:47.615 --> 20:48.999
that, uh, there was
another meeting tonight.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.610
Yeah, we were looking for you.
Don't worry about it.

20:50.611 --> 20:51.983
'Cause I hate to think I was excluded

20:51.984 --> 20:53.416
just so someone else wouldn't find out.

20:55.037 --> 20:55.854
Listen...

20:56.183 --> 20:57.688
You and I know both know
that Juliette's had

20:57.689 --> 21:00.487
some very serious lapses in judgment.

21:00.488 --> 21:03.289
That's true. I'm just trying to
keep her from having another one.

21:03.326 --> 21:05.156
And as a friend or whatever you are,

21:05.916 --> 21:06.909
I hope you do the same.

21:07.265 --> 21:08.206
I'm her friend, Glenn,

21:08.207 --> 21:10.437
and no matter what we do,
she's gonna make mistakes.

21:10.694 --> 21:11.738
She's a young artist.

21:11.739 --> 21:13.915
The key word is "young," okay?

21:14.145 --> 21:15.033
You know, it wasn't that long ago

21:15.034 --> 21:16.542
that I found her down in Alabama...

21:16.543 --> 21:19.373
just some scraggly haired
little kid with this big voice,

21:19.374 --> 21:21.640
trying out for some local TV show.

21:21.684 --> 21:23.196
She had nothing, nobody, all right?

21:23.197 --> 21:24.557
No mom. That's for sure.

21:24.664 --> 21:26.408
Just me. Deacon!

21:27.096 --> 21:28.003
Deacon! Whoo!

21:28.004 --> 21:29.348
I think she just needs
to try some stuff out,

21:29.349 --> 21:31.429
find out who she's gonna be. I
know what she needs. Mm-hmm.

21:31.633 --> 21:32.668
I helped make her.

21:32.669 --> 21:34.051
I've been like a father to her.

21:34.371 --> 21:35.854
Fathers let their kids grow up.

21:36.223 --> 21:37.378
Hey!

21:38.127 --> 21:40.078
Deacon, I got some song
ideas I wanna run by you.

21:40.138 --> 21:41.953
You're already cuttin'
into my beauty sleep here.

21:41.954 --> 21:42.813
Yeah, I mean,

21:42.856 --> 21:44.587
we got an early flight in
the morning home, you know?

21:44.588 --> 21:46.736
Yeah, an early flight
home on my jet, Glenn,

21:46.737 --> 21:48.271
so make sure the damn thing waits.

21:48.272 --> 21:49.581
Please, just for a second.

21:49.582 --> 21:51.722

I got 'em fresh in my mind.

wants to buy my publishing.

22:17.352 --> 22:18.182
So?

22:18.202 --> 22:19.827
So maybe we should consider it.

22:20.015 --> 22:22.509
You think I fought as hard as
I did to keep your catalog

22:22.510 --> 22:25.687
just so you could sell it off
to some anybody on music row?

It is illegal to harbor a fugitive.

It was armed robbery, and I drove the car.

I went along with it.

scared out of my mind.

27:22.856 --> 27:24.063

Don't know what I thought he
was gonna rob the store with,

27:27.239 --> 27:29.400
if not a gun. So you... you
were part of that?

I panicked...

27:31.671 --> 27:32.780
And I left him there.

27:33.514 --> 27:35.654
But he didn't say anything to anybody

27:35.655 --> 27:36.691
about me being there.

27:37.071 --> 27:38.798
You know how hard it's been
for me to live with that?

You were a kid, and he put
you in that position.

27:42.493 --> 27:44.006
Do you understand how awful that is?

27:45.368 --> 27:46.713

29:21.778 --> 29:23.299

29:24.291 --> 29:26.414

break with two new songs...

29:26.415 --> 29:28.167
something simple and authentic.

29:28.182 --> 29:29.348
You and I can rehearse in Nashville,

29:29.349 --> 29:31.625

we're gonna have a showcase

29:31.626 --> 29:34.081
that's acoustic and real and grounded,

29:34.082 --> 29:36.247
and just to offset from all the glitter

29:36.248 --> 29:37.350
that we put out there.

29:38.536 --> 29:39.981

Don't get me wrong. I appreciate him.

29:49.611 --> 29:52.286

but... but he still thinks

29:52.287 --> 29:53.614
that I'm this know-nothin' little girl,

29:53.615 --> 29:55.178
and I'm not gonna be his puppet forever.

29:55.354 --> 29:56.889
Well, then you should tell him, you know?

29:56.890 --> 29:58.944

spend more damn time just...

29:59.285 --> 30:00.639

30:04.517 --> 30:05.405

30:05.553 --> 30:08.086

me behind my back?

30:08.600 --> 30:12.320
No, just... loose conversation, you know?

30:13.427 --> 30:15.588
And who else is he having
loose conversation with?

30:16.744 --> 30:17.681
Look...

30:18.291 --> 30:19.554
Everyone's just trying to figure out a way

30:19.555 --> 30:21.039

You are my employees. You work for me.

30:47.572 --> 30:49.339
Not this man! Me.

30:49.394 --> 30:52.321
Okay? Whatever I say gets done.

30:52.925 --> 30:54.112
And if anybody

30:54.190 --> 30:57.495
ever goes behind my back
to my band, to my crew,

30:57.496 --> 30:58.752
or anybody else,

30:59.755 --> 31:01.337
you'll be right back at the county fair

31:01.338 --> 31:02.924
looking for your next teen queen.

31:02.925 --> 31:03.762
You know what?

31:04.811 --> 31:06.622
I'm done. I quit.

31:13.801 --> 31:14.959
Anybody else?

31:15.027 --> 31:16.945
Huh?! Show's over!

31:31.411 --> 31:33.211
I'm gonna break my daughter's hearts.

31:35.749 --> 31:37.325
Of course they love their family.

31:37.326 --> 31:38.778
Of course they love their father.

31:42.719 --> 31:44.358
I'm thinking maybe I should just suck it up

31:44.359 --> 31:45.340
and just try to...

31:47.357 --> 31:49.183
Stay in it, you know?

31:49.184 --> 31:51.301
Yeah, well, my parents stayed in it,

31:51.747 --> 31:53.925
and they were always fighting
behind closed doors,

31:53.926 --> 31:58.276
and then... they smiled fake
smiles at each other in public.

32:04.634 --> 32:06.242
Best day of my childhood was the day

32:06.243 --> 32:08.262
my mom said she was finally leaving.

32:12.817 --> 32:14.848
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

32:18.129 --> 32:19.454
Best day of my childhood...

32:20.847 --> 32:21.864
When I look back.

32:24.173 --> 32:26.106
Yeah. I'm not gonna lie to you.

32:28.762 --> 32:30.496
Tomorrow is gonna suck.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.448
Oh, man, I just see a
road of just pain and...

32:37.269 --> 32:40.022
Tears and anger and...

32:42.419 --> 32:43.461
I keep thinking,

32:43.462 --> 32:44.928
was there anything I could
have done differently?

32:50.695 --> 32:52.841
Just wish it didn't have
to hurt everybody so...

33:00.014 --> 33:01.473
Why don't you come home with me?

33:04.636 --> 33:07.082
Because I'm sick of the
drama, you know, with...

33:09.629 --> 33:12.414
Teddy and Deacon and my sister and...

33:16.768 --> 33:18.833
You're the guy with no strings attached.

33:20.033 --> 33:22.596
No strings? Yeah.

33:22.618 --> 33:25.987
We made half an album.
We're practically married.

33:26.408 --> 33:29.501
Gosh. We should probably finish that album.

33:30.850 --> 33:31.761
Duh.

33:35.832 --> 33:36.987
Go away.

33:42.298 --> 33:43.400
Great place.

33:44.276 --> 33:45.263
It's all Scarlett.

33:48.928 --> 33:51.564
Well, I'm gonna go grab
some sheets or somethin'.

34:01.019 --> 34:01.942
Thank you.

34:04.604 --> 34:07.834
For... letting me stay here.
It's very kind of you.

34:07.878 --> 34:09.391
It is not for you. It's for Gunnar.

34:10.431 --> 34:11.438
You understand me?

34:14.859 --> 34:16.815
Take your boots off. There are
clean towels in the bathroom.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.286
Yes, ma'am.

34:24.443 --> 34:25.304
Can you hold that?

34:31.266 --> 34:32.231
What?

34:35.766 --> 34:37.041
You feeling better this morning?

34:37.786 --> 34:39.560
Is that a question or an accusation?

34:39.762 --> 34:41.902
Was that part of your plan to be
seen as a more mature artist?

34:41.904 --> 34:44.130
You know what? People need
to be reminded who's boss.

34:44.342 --> 34:46.331
What, those people you
keep calling your family?

34:46.333 --> 34:48.080
What... what do you suggest that I do

34:48.081 --> 34:49.540
when Glenn goes behind my back,

34:49.541 --> 34:51.277
just act like everything is all right?

34:52.062 --> 34:52.973
I don't know. Look, I just don't...

34:53.643 --> 34:54.956
Care for that side of you.

34:56.521 --> 34:58.042
You gonna quit on me, too?

34:58.420 --> 35:00.702
You talk to me like that,
you're damn right.

35:02.460 --> 35:03.633
I'll tell you somethin' else.

35:04.675 --> 35:05.434
You know, time will come

35:05.435 --> 35:06.864
when you need some good people around you,

35:07.358 --> 35:08.995
well, they might just have
something better to do.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.902
Car's right up here, miss Jaymes.

35:33.903 --> 35:35.143
All right. See y'all in a month.

35:35.771 --> 35:36.590
Hey!

35:37.506 --> 35:38.273
Hey.

35:39.446 --> 35:40.433
You have a good night?

35:42.220 --> 35:43.371
It was all right.

35:44.212 --> 35:45.664
Y'all sure made up quick, huh?

35:45.791 --> 35:46.711
You and Liam.

35:46.988 --> 35:49.714
Yeah. He's a friend, Deacon.

35:49.715 --> 35:50.788
Yeah, I bet.

35:53.096 --> 35:54.155
Hey, hey.

35:56.422 --> 35:57.805
What do you want from me right now?

35:58.198 --> 35:59.187
Nothing, ray.

36:01.589 --> 36:02.784
Not a damn thing.

36:15.877 --> 36:16.789
What are you makin'?

36:16.790 --> 36:17.942
Hole-in-one eggs.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.059
Used to make these up for
Gunnar when we were kids.

36:20.981 --> 36:23.607
Left alone, he'd try to
live off of cold cereal.

36:23.951 --> 36:25.330
Raised like wolves?

36:25.965 --> 36:27.324
Just stuck together, is all.

36:28.538 --> 36:30.510
Had to, you know, had no one else, really.

36:32.137 --> 36:34.076
Well, Gunnar said you had a
grandma taking care of you.

36:35.868 --> 36:36.802
Mm-hmm.

36:38.473 --> 36:39.975
Still wasn't easy on the kid.

36:40.561 --> 36:42.283
Half the reason I taught him guitar

36:42.684 --> 36:44.056
was keep him from moping in his room.

36:44.057 --> 36:45.328
I was never a moper.

36:46.611 --> 36:47.731
Play guitar, too?

36:47.927 --> 36:48.833
I used to.

36:50.439 --> 36:51.342
Why'd you stop?

36:52.605 --> 36:53.562
I gave it to him.

36:59.223 --> 37:00.522
He made your favorite eggs.

37:07.238 --> 37:08.487
Bon appetit.

37:14.249 --> 37:15.103
Thanks.

37:20.438 --> 37:23.086
I'm not quite sure how to
even start this conversation

37:24.773 --> 37:28.013
other than... I don't know...
telling them that we love them

37:28.014 --> 37:29.984
and that this is not their fault.

37:34.071 --> 37:36.133
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

37:37.095 --> 37:38.105
Me, too.

37:38.969 --> 37:41.061
Just don't know why we
have to rush into it.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.968
Oh, my God. Mommy, you're home!

37:44.265 --> 37:45.447
Hi, girls!

37:46.200 --> 37:48.133
Hi, sweetheart. Ooh, I missed you.

37:48.274 --> 37:49.580
I missed you, too.

37:49.581 --> 37:51.682
Oh, did you see my project?
I can't believe it.

37:51.683 --> 37:52.786
I got an "a." It's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

37:52.787 --> 37:54.846
You got an "a." Can I have hug, please?

37:55.716 --> 37:56.597
I missed you.

37:56.598 --> 37:59.072
I missed you, too. I made you a cake!
I made you a cake!

37:59.073 --> 38:00.537
We made you a cake.

38:00.568 --> 38:01.650
A cake?

38:03.360 --> 38:04.514
Oh, my gosh.

38:12.031 --> 38:13.380
Can you please put the luggage over there?

38:13.381 --> 38:16.033
And be really careful of the floors.
All right. Okay. No problem.

38:18.655 --> 38:19.509
Uh...

38:20.298 --> 38:22.302
Is there anything else I can do for you?

38:22.781 --> 38:25.139
Get you breakfast? I could
stay and make something.

38:31.206 --> 38:32.123
No.

38:32.718 --> 38:33.971
No.

38:34.347 --> 38:35.374
Thank you.

38:54.222 --> 38:55.209
Do you think he'd get a fresh start

38:55.210 --> 38:56.509
if he came here and did music?

38:57.035 --> 38:58.352
Not so long as he's on the run.

38:59.791 --> 39:01.689
But he was always the one
that had the real talent.

39:02.023 --> 39:03.396
You say that like it's your fault.

39:04.432 --> 39:06.068
It's just, you know, he spent
all those years raising me,

39:06.069 --> 39:10.401
and... that was his chance to...
to make it.

39:10.729 --> 39:11.977
It was also his choice.

39:13.072 --> 39:13.906
Yep.

39:15.527 --> 39:16.394
Anyway,

39:16.685 --> 39:18.083
you think this is the song we should play

39:18.084 --> 39:19.189
for the queen of country?

39:19.508 --> 39:20.341
You work so hard.

39:20.342 --> 39:23.103
You should do it 'cause you
feel like you deserve it,

39:23.617 --> 39:24.979
for you, not 'cause you feel guilty.

39:24.980 --> 39:27.460
Can we just play the damn
song, please? Mm-hmm.

39:29.598 --> 39:30.912
