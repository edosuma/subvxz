♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.542 --> 00:09.333
( upbeat rock music playing )

00:09.375 --> 00:10.625
ADDISON:
I couldn't sleep.

00:10.667 --> 00:13.750
I kept trying to tell myself
that it was from something

00:13.792 --> 00:15.500
other than Sam,
but, I mean, come on.

00:15.542 --> 00:18.709
How can I ignore the fact
that my bed is half empty?

00:18.750 --> 00:23.041
It's like this space
that I can't occupy.

00:23.083 --> 00:27.750
You know, it's his space.
Sam's space. He belongs there.

00:27.792 --> 00:31.625
Anyway, so I'm up, flipping
around through the channels,

00:31.667 --> 00:33.625
and I came across
this documentary.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.667
THERAPIST: What about?
The history of shin-kicking.

00:36.709 --> 00:39.959
I had no idea that
this existed as a sport.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.041
I mean, for 400 years

00:42.083 --> 00:44.959
men have been kicking
each other in the shins.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.667
Like, professionally.

00:46.709 --> 00:49.625
What was so captivating
about it?

00:49.667 --> 00:52.166
Ha, ha. I don't know. I--

00:52.208 --> 00:53.709
Uh...

00:53.750 --> 00:55.750
I couldn't sleep.

01:22.834 --> 01:26.000
You, uh, all right there?
Yeah.

01:27.125 --> 01:28.542
No.

01:28.583 --> 01:30.041
Sam and I broke up.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.959
What?
I lost my boyfriend

01:32.000 --> 01:34.709
and my baby in one day.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.041
( Addison laughs )

01:36.083 --> 01:39.500
And I haven't
been sleeping much.

01:39.542 --> 01:42.333
I'm sorry about you and Sam.
Really. Uh...

01:42.375 --> 01:45.625
But you didn't lose your baby.
Someone else got theirs.

01:45.667 --> 01:47.917
You'll get yours. I mean,
adoption's always on the table.

01:47.959 --> 01:51.709
Well, I'm not really interested
in being picked over again.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.208
Well, there's
always surrogacy.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.709
I can get you a great donor egg
and a healthy surrogate.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.625
I'm tired.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.375
All right, I know it's hard
to think about now,

02:01.417 --> 02:02.625
but you do have options.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.750
Why not surrogacy?

02:06.792 --> 02:09.166
You get your baby and someone
else's boobs take the hit.

02:09.208 --> 02:13.291
Heh. Because I've already jumped
through a thousand hoops.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.291
I don't think I can make it
through a thousand more.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.041
All right, tell me something.

02:17.083 --> 02:18.542
Take my mind off this.

02:18.583 --> 02:20.959
AMELIA:
Well, I'm staying sober.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't miss Ryan any less,
but I'm sober.

02:27.083 --> 02:28.375
He'd be proud of you.

02:28.417 --> 02:30.125
I'm proud of you.

02:35.417 --> 02:36.834
I overslept.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.500
Turned your alarm off.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.417
Why?
You think I didn't hear you two

02:40.458 --> 02:42.041
giggling with the TV on
past midnight?

02:42.083 --> 02:44.041
The Cartoon Channel was playing
a Pokémon marathon

02:44.083 --> 02:45.291
that Mason
had never seen.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.041
It was Pokémon:
The Rise of Darkrai.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.500
You had no business
keeping that boy up so late.

02:49.542 --> 02:52.750
He is off from school today.
You are not.

02:52.792 --> 02:54.792
Where's Mason?
He's in your office.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.333
Did he eat?
Yep.

02:57.375 --> 02:58.625
I can crack an egg.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.625
He's nervous about
his spelling bee.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.500
I promised to--
I quizzed him on the way in.

03:02.542 --> 03:04.625
His toothbrush
looked a little ragged,

03:04.667 --> 03:05.917
so we stopped
and got a new one.

03:05.959 --> 03:09.625
Erica will be by
in a little bit to pick him up.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.458
Don't get used to it.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.625
My partner and I
were following a car

03:14.667 --> 03:16.750
that had just been involved
in an armed robbery.

03:16.792 --> 03:21.542
All of a sudden, the guy ditches
it, takes off. So I went.

03:21.583 --> 03:24.166
I cornered him,
I drew my weapon,

03:24.208 --> 03:27.000
and he made a move
for his waistband.

03:27.041 --> 03:31.750
I saw a flash, I reacted,
I shot, and I killed him.

03:31.792 --> 03:35.041
And it turned out
he was unarmed, right?

03:35.083 --> 03:37.625
Yeah. But the guy
just robbed a gas station.

03:37.667 --> 03:41.417
With a gun. So I assumed that--
Of course. Of course.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.917
And now how do you feel?

03:44.959 --> 03:46.500
Like I followed protocol.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.875
That's not exactly
what I'm asking.

03:47.917 --> 03:51.041
What I'm asking is how you
feel about what happened.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.625
Look, what I did?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.041
It's part of the job.

03:55.083 --> 03:58.125
Having to discharge your weapon
isn't usually part of the job.

04:01.625 --> 04:02.917
Are you sleeping at night?

04:02.959 --> 04:05.625
You know, I appreciate Joe,

04:05.667 --> 04:08.458
you know, sending me
to somebody that he trusts.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.667
But, um, I just--
I wanna get back to work.

04:11.709 --> 04:16.750
That's tricky, getting back to
work after something like this.

04:16.792 --> 04:20.208
It can also put a lot
of stress on your home life.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.041
How are things there?

04:22.083 --> 04:24.834
You want me to say
that my home life sucks

04:24.875 --> 04:26.959
because nobody else
gets me except other cops?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.959
I wanna know how
you're handling it all.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.583
Huh.

04:33.583 --> 04:37.333
In my job, I see things.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.458
Things that, um...

04:39.500 --> 04:43.125
I can't describe them
to my wife.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.542
And when I get home,

04:46.709 --> 04:48.750
sometimes they're
still in my head.

04:48.792 --> 04:51.291
And you can't talk to anyone
at work about this, either?

04:51.333 --> 04:53.667
You're not the first cop
I've dealt with.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.709
I know what it's like.

04:55.750 --> 04:59.000
So you can talk to me.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.041
( knocking on door )

05:01.083 --> 05:02.291
How you guys doing in here?

05:02.333 --> 05:03.750
Give us a couple minutes?

05:03.792 --> 05:05.667
I'd love to, Shelly,
but I'm on the clock.

05:05.709 --> 05:08.458
I gotta get this kid home,
so let's go.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.792
Thanks, doc. Really.
Yeah.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.041
Aaron and I were starting
to make progress.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.041
Well, I appreciate you
stepping up here, Shelly.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.083
These in-house counselors,

05:17.125 --> 05:18.959
they're looking
to cover their own asses.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm just not sure
he's ready to go back.

05:21.041 --> 05:22.792
You don't get over
what he did in a week.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.125
He did his job.

05:24.166 --> 05:27.750
No, he killed someone
in the course of doing his job.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.542
It's not the same thing.
A cop shoots an unarmed kid,

05:30.583 --> 05:32.208
everyone
starts asking questions.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.750
I'm less worried
about how it looks

05:33.792 --> 05:36.041
than about where
his head's at.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.291
Well, if you say so,
Shelly,

05:37.333 --> 05:38.709
I'll make sure
he sees a therapist.

05:38.750 --> 05:41.041
Heck, I'll even drive him
down here once a week,

05:41.083 --> 05:43.625
after we restore him
to active duty.

05:43.667 --> 05:47.625
This IA investigation hasn't
wrapped, and they catch wind

05:47.667 --> 05:49.959
of you not signing off
on this kid right away...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.375
You get my drift?
I think so.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.375
You want me to say
it's all right for him

05:54.417 --> 05:56.542
to go back to work even though
I'm not comfortable with it.

05:56.583 --> 05:59.250
I want you to help
the kid out.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.834
( dramatic theme playing )

06:11.417 --> 06:13.041
Dragon. D-R-A-G-O-N.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.000
Dragon.
On fire.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.250
Okay, Coop. Retrieval.
Okay, retrieval.

06:18.291 --> 06:20.875
R-E-T-R-E-E--

06:20.917 --> 06:22.458
( Amelia &amp; Mason mimic buzzer )

06:22.500 --> 06:26.792
Retrieval.
R-E-T-R-I-E-V-A-L.

06:26.834 --> 06:29.625
COOPER: Gosh.
The new and undisputed

06:29.667 --> 06:31.792
spelling champion
of the kitchen is Mason.

06:31.834 --> 06:34.041
( Cooper whistles
then mimics crowd roaring )

06:34.083 --> 06:36.458
Milkshakes before noon?

06:36.500 --> 06:38.041
MASON:
It's a special flavor
Cooper made.

06:38.083 --> 06:39.583
Marshmallow cream,
caramel syrup--

06:39.625 --> 06:42.041
COOPER:
No, no, no. Secret recipe.
Secret recipe.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.709
You've gotta try it.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.250
ERICA:
Mm-hm.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.041
ERICA: It's sweet.
It's delicious.

06:51.083 --> 06:55.417
Delicious. D-E-L-I-S-H-O-O-S-H.
MASON: Errh.

06:55.458 --> 06:58.625
ERICA: Oh, my God! So sorry.
AMELIA: Whoa.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.458
ERICA: Aah.
Are you okay, Mom?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.709
Well, it looks like
she will keep her finger,

07:03.750 --> 07:06.542
but your mom
might need stitches.

07:06.583 --> 07:11.125
Stitches. S-T-I-T-C-H-E-S.
Stitches.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.959
I'll do it.
You guys clean up.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.333
Wah.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.500
Sam wouldn't even smile
at me this morning.

07:20.542 --> 07:23.750
I saw him draw
his shades the other day.

07:23.792 --> 07:26.500
All of them.
Your lives are very intertwined.

07:26.542 --> 07:27.625
It's bound to be unpleasant.

07:27.667 --> 07:30.041
Ugh. I just wish
I was sleeping.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.208
When Pete first left,
I wasn't sleeping.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.083
And then I started
sleeping sideways.

07:34.125 --> 07:36.375
I don't know.
It was oddly comforting.

07:36.417 --> 07:38.041
What do you do
when the one person

07:38.083 --> 07:39.250
who can make you
feel better

07:39.291 --> 07:40.709
is the one person
who won't talk to you?

07:40.750 --> 07:43.041
Hell if I know.
Unh. Unh.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.500
MAN: You go to hell!
Ah, that must be my patient.

07:45.542 --> 07:48.041
SCOTT:
You're in the hospital.
We're gonna take care of you.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.125
Go to hell!
All of you go to hell!

07:50.166 --> 07:53.041
I am not supposed to be here!
I have important people--

07:53.083 --> 07:56.250
We found him on Ocean Avenue. He
was yelling at a fire hydrant.

07:56.291 --> 07:59.125
People are waiting to listen
to what I have to say.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.500
That's enough.
It's okay, you can let him go.

08:01.542 --> 08:03.667
Mr. Bauer. Sounds like
you're having a hard day.

08:03.709 --> 08:06.500
I have a knife. I have
two knives. And I will stab

08:06.542 --> 08:08.709
every person in here
who's looking at me right now.

08:08.750 --> 08:12.083
I will stab you.
Mr. Bauer, you know better

08:12.125 --> 08:15.083
than to talk that way.
You're scaring everybody.

08:15.125 --> 08:18.041
What would your mother say if
she heard you talking that way?

08:18.083 --> 08:21.000
Could I get ten milligrams
of Haloperidol, please?

08:21.041 --> 08:23.500
Don't you come near me.
Don't any of you come near me.

08:23.542 --> 08:25.542
I am the only one
that's gonna come near you.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.834
Because I wanna help you.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.583
Okay?

08:29.625 --> 08:31.542
I know it's frustrating.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.375
I know it's very confusing
being in here,

08:33.417 --> 08:35.041
but I'm gonna give you
some medicine

08:35.083 --> 08:36.792
and you're gonna feel
much better soon.

08:36.834 --> 08:39.041
Okay?

08:39.083 --> 08:42.208
Everybody else
is going back to work.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.000
Here it is.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.041
Can you do that yourself?

08:47.083 --> 08:49.333
There you go.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.542
Good. There you go.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.750
Thank you. Thank you.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.667
Good job.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.041
You're gonna feel
much better soon.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.291
Good job.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.417
Any weakness in your hand
before today?

09:09.458 --> 09:10.542
It's just an old habit.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.583
It's like a tick I picked up
in middle school.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.625
And the glass? Seemed like
you couldn't grip it.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.041
It was just wet.
It just slipped.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.583
Have you been having
any headaches?

09:20.625 --> 09:22.041
Dizziness?
I'm a single mom.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.709
I work 50 hours a week.
I get headaches.

09:24.750 --> 09:28.709
I'd be happy to check you out.
I appreciate it, but I--

09:28.750 --> 09:30.291
You know,
I have my own doctor.

09:30.333 --> 09:33.250
Who has probably never given
you a complete neuro workup.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.041
We can get you over
to St. Ambrose.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.667
I could give you
an MRI.

09:36.709 --> 09:39.166
It would take an hour
or two, tops.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.709
I don't have an hour.
You never know with these kind--

09:41.750 --> 09:42.792
Look, I know
it's what you do,

09:42.834 --> 09:46.041
but I just don't like
being poked and prodded.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.041
I didn't mean it like that.
No, it's cool.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.000
Just let it go,
heh. Okay?

09:54.375 --> 09:57.750
Done.
Great. Thank you.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.041
( upbeat theme playing )

10:07.500 --> 10:10.458
Hi. Dr. Turner?
Hello.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
I'm Scott Becker.

10:12.542 --> 10:14.667
I brought in the guy
you talked down yesterday.

10:14.709 --> 10:17.500
Oh, yeah. Hi.
Hi.

10:17.542 --> 10:20.458
What you did for him, that was--
That was really impressive.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.041
Thank you.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.375
Yeah, I see a lot
of doctors here,

10:23.417 --> 10:27.583
but what you did was, um...

10:27.625 --> 10:29.583
You're different.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.458
I'm starting to sound
ridiculous,

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
so I was wondering
if you'd be interested

10:33.542 --> 10:36.041
in going out
with me sometime?

10:36.083 --> 10:39.500
( chuckles )

10:39.542 --> 10:42.500
That's very sweet.
That was a tiny bit patronizing.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.583
Still, why don't you say yes?

10:44.625 --> 10:46.041
I guarantee
you'll have a good time.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.583
I am sure you're great,

10:47.625 --> 10:49.667
but this is just not
the best time for me right now.

10:49.709 --> 10:52.709
But, um, thank you.
Really.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.500
Hey, fellas.
Hey, Sam.

11:02.542 --> 11:04.834
I heard about you and Addison.
I'm sorry, man.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.583
Yeah.
You guys--?

11:06.625 --> 11:09.000
We broke up.
Oh, man. You okay?

11:09.041 --> 11:10.917
I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:10.959 --> 11:14.792
It was amicable, adult.
It made sense.

11:14.834 --> 11:17.834
I had a dream last night
that I ran her over.

11:17.875 --> 11:21.625
Flattened her.
Like in a cartoon.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.041
That's adult.
You know, adult breakups

11:24.083 --> 11:25.417
are myths perpetrated by women

11:25.458 --> 11:27.625
so they can have their cake
and eat it too.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.375
( Jake chuckles )

11:29.417 --> 11:33.583
The mature way to do things
is just untangle and move on.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.542
Good luck selling your house
and finding a new job.

11:35.583 --> 11:38.041
I've done this before, okay?
With Naomi.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.375
She's my ex-wife.
She used to work here.

11:40.417 --> 11:41.417
How'd that work?

11:41.458 --> 11:42.667
Got involved
with her best friend.

11:42.709 --> 11:43.875
Who? Addison?
Mm-hm.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.583
Oh, man, you are a glutton
for punishment.

11:45.625 --> 11:48.625
The thing is we broke up over
a baby that doesn't even exist.

11:48.667 --> 11:49.792
Is she even gonna have one?

11:49.834 --> 11:52.333
Mm-mm. You better ask her.
PETE: Hey, hey, come on.

11:52.375 --> 11:56.041
Right now this is a baby-free,
estrogen-free zone.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.041
Look, I spent the whole weekend
just sitting around.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.625
Sitting around.
We need to go out.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.583
Let's go out.
It's not a bad idea.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.500
Have some drinks.
Right. Some drinks.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.500
I won't talk about Violet.
Don't talk about Addison.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.041
You don't talk about babies.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.667
Done.
All right. Bring it in.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.250
I guess I'm just
a little bit excited.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.500
Look, maybe the glass did
just slip out of Erica's hand,

12:21.542 --> 12:23.417
but she was flexing it earlier
as if it were weak.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.709
And?
And when I tracked her eyes,

12:25.750 --> 12:27.417
the right one was lagging
behind the left.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.583
These are serious
neurological symptoms.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.041
It could be a lacunar infarct,
onset of MS.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.583
Is there a reason

12:33.625 --> 12:35.750
you're having this conversation
with me instead of her?

12:35.792 --> 12:38.250
I offered to do a workup.
She shot me down.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.041
Maybe Cooper can convince her?

12:41.083 --> 12:42.750
Telling Cooper
will only have him jump

12:42.792 --> 12:44.125
to the worst possible
conclusion.

12:44.166 --> 12:45.667
So you just wanna turn
a blind eye to this

12:45.709 --> 12:47.667
and hope that nothing
serious is going on?

12:47.709 --> 12:50.333
That's your call.
But if Erica strokes out

12:50.375 --> 12:52.083
and drives Mason off the side
of the PCH,

12:52.125 --> 12:54.583
what do you think
you'll tell Cooper then?

12:56.792 --> 12:58.625
He shot and killed a man.
He's a good kid.

12:58.667 --> 12:59.834
I'm not making a value judgment,

12:59.875 --> 13:01.709
I'm just saying he couldn't
possibly be ready

13:01.750 --> 13:02.750
to go back to work.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.041
If every cop with PTSD
was benched,

13:04.083 --> 13:05.959
there wouldn't be
any police left.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.542
Well, strip all
of that away, okay?

13:07.583 --> 13:10.041
Joe asking you the favor,
the fact Aaron is on the force,

13:10.083 --> 13:12.083
what would you do?
I'd want him to get some help,

13:12.125 --> 13:13.709
work through the trauma.

13:13.750 --> 13:17.542
Exactly. You have an opportunity
to step up for Aaron

13:17.583 --> 13:19.041
in a situation where he might
not be able

13:19.083 --> 13:20.333
to step up for himself.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.125
Or I could push the point,
keep him off the force,

13:22.166 --> 13:23.375
and destroy his career.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.083
That's what your buddy
wants you to believe.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.125
I've been around enough cops
to know he's right.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.792
So you just check the box,
you put Aaron out on the street,

13:29.834 --> 13:31.583
and hope he's stable
enough to keep it together?

13:31.625 --> 13:33.375
Joe said he'd make sure
he gets some help.

13:33.417 --> 13:36.458
Ah. Does the police department
seem like the kind of place

13:36.500 --> 13:37.875
where therapy's encouraged?

13:37.917 --> 13:40.583
Look, Violet, with all due
respect, I'm not being naive.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.333
Okay? But I know Joe.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.583
And I have to make a choice:

13:43.625 --> 13:45.750
I trust him
or I put the kid in a position

13:45.792 --> 13:48.208
where he could lose everything.
Shouldn't you be asking

13:48.250 --> 13:50.625
if the kid loses more
by going back to work too soon?

13:51.625 --> 13:53.083
( sighs )

13:53.125 --> 13:55.041
Not gonna do this. It's lying.
Okay.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.041
It is.
And I just busted Cooper's butt

13:57.083 --> 13:59.041
over doing something like this.
Yeah, you did.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.291
Not to mention that the
patient specifically said

14:01.333 --> 14:03.625
she did not want this
to happen,

14:03.667 --> 14:06.959
which makes it against
the law and unethical.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.750
Why do I feel
like there's a "but" coming?

14:12.542 --> 14:15.542
( dramatic theme playing )

14:18.166 --> 14:21.250
This is Dr. Charlotte King. I'm
chief of staff at St. Ambrose.

14:21.291 --> 14:26.041
We have a patient, Erica Warner,
who just arrived in our ER.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.750
She was seen in your clinic
a few months ago.

14:27.792 --> 14:30.542
We need her medical records.

14:30.583 --> 14:31.792
No, not everything,

14:31.834 --> 14:36.834
just her most recent
head CT and MRI would be useful.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.542
She's in a medically induced
coma, no next of kin,

14:39.583 --> 14:42.667
so you're gonna have to wait
on the consent forms.

14:42.709 --> 14:45.041
Look, we can debate this
or we can do the right thing

14:45.083 --> 14:47.083
and save this woman's life.

14:48.709 --> 14:51.667
Courier's fine. Thank you.

14:52.750 --> 14:53.750
( sighs )

14:56.291 --> 14:59.834
( upbeat rock theme playing )

14:59.875 --> 15:01.291
I was completely clear,

15:01.333 --> 15:05.250
completely clear with Addison
that I did not want a kid.

15:05.291 --> 15:06.875
Were you expecting her
to give up?

15:06.917 --> 15:08.625
Hey. No Violet. No Addison.
No babies. Shh.

15:08.667 --> 15:10.917
SAM: All right.
Look, Sam was a good soldier

15:10.959 --> 15:13.375
and we just-- We know what
happens to the good soldiers.

15:13.417 --> 15:15.458
Yeah. What?
JAKE: What's that?

15:15.500 --> 15:17.917
They-- Uh--
PETE &amp; JAKE: Ha-ha-ha.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.458
They go missing.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.458
Good soldiers go missing,

15:21.500 --> 15:24.041
and then their brothers
have to go and get them.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.750
I need another drink.
What is going on?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.625
Yeah, like Sam needs
another office romance.

15:27.667 --> 15:31.542
Well, you know how-- Hey. Ahem.
JAKE: Hey.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.500
I've been looking for a drink,
she goes right to Jake.

15:33.542 --> 15:35.542
Can I get you anything?
No, I'm fine right now.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.041
Well, if you need anything...

15:38.083 --> 15:41.667
I-- No, I need something.

15:41.709 --> 15:44.041
Impressive.
Actually, she was.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.041
Oh.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.709
For real?
Really? Really?

15:46.750 --> 15:48.041
I gotta have a life outside of
work.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.625
SAM:
Apparently.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.667
COOPER:
We need to hang out
with this guy more.

15:51.709 --> 15:54.458
Okay, okay. I'm a married man,
but I'm just saying,

15:54.500 --> 15:56.792
that pretty young lady
over there just smiled at me.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.500
SAM: All right.
Oh, no, no.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.083
She's looking at Sam.
COOPER: Mm...

16:02.125 --> 16:03.250
COOPER &amp; SAM:
Oh.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.917
Yes. She most definitely was.

16:05.959 --> 16:07.375
Yes.

16:07.417 --> 16:08.792
I think I'm gonna
go over there.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.375
Really?
Yeah. Why? Why not?

16:11.417 --> 16:13.500
You haven't picked up a girl
since middle school.

16:13.542 --> 16:17.041
Oh, come on. I'm sure
it's just like riding a bike.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.500
Don't tell her you
just learned last year.

16:19.542 --> 16:21.583
My brothers, let's mock him
on the way out of battle,

16:21.625 --> 16:23.166
not on the way in.
Okay.

16:23.208 --> 16:25.041
Thank you. I think
I'm gonna be fine.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.792
COOPER:
Go get them.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.500
( upbeat lounge music
playing on speakers)

16:28.542 --> 16:31.041
( grunts )

16:31.083 --> 16:32.583
Who's gonna get
the next round?

16:34.750 --> 16:36.625
I guess it's me.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.041
Hi.
Hi.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.959
You drinking bourbon?
Rye.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.291
You drink rye on the rocks?
It's an old-fashioned.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.834
Oh. Doesn't that usually have,
like, a cherry in it?

16:51.875 --> 16:53.583
If you're a teenage girl

16:53.625 --> 16:56.333
or you take pride
in sullying classic drinks.

16:56.375 --> 17:00.041
Maybe I'll try one.
Don't. They're serving swill.

17:00.083 --> 17:04.625
I'm in from out of town on
a conference. Wanted to go out.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.458
And I'm already regretting it.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.667
Yeah, this really
isn't my kind of place, either.

17:09.709 --> 17:11.041
So, what kind
of place do you like?

17:11.083 --> 17:14.041
Quiet. Good music.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.750
And a great cocktail.

17:16.792 --> 17:18.875
Those places do exist
in L.A.

17:18.917 --> 17:21.000
Mm.
If you have time.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.041
Well, how about my room?

17:25.083 --> 17:27.041
It's quiet,
I have great music,

17:27.083 --> 17:29.000
and I have a killer
bottle of bourbon.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.875
Unless, of course, you're

17:31.917 --> 17:33.834
a cherry-in-the-old-fashioned
kind of guy.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.875
( both laugh )

17:38.959 --> 17:40.834
Are you really a doctor?
Yes, I am.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.834
What kind?
I'm a heart surgeon.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.500
Oh. The last guy I met

17:44.542 --> 17:46.291
said he was a big
television producer.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.041
Okay.
Turns out that he's the guy

17:48.083 --> 17:49.875
who got the writers
their Frappuccinos.

17:49.917 --> 17:51.667
( laughs )

17:51.709 --> 17:53.625
So...
Well, I don't know.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.083
How do you want me
to prove it?

17:55.125 --> 17:57.417
How can I prove it
to you?

17:59.041 --> 18:02.875
What muscle is this? Ha-ha-ha.
Ha, ha.

18:02.917 --> 18:06.041
Yes.
Well, that is the bicep brachii.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.667
Good.
Mm-hm.

18:07.709 --> 18:10.417
There we have the
pectoralis major.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.750
Uh-huh.

18:11.792 --> 18:16.458
And down there, we have
the transverse abdominis.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.041
I could play
this game all night.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.041
Right. Me too.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.041
I mean, I actually know
all of the names

18:22.083 --> 18:24.500
of all the muscles, so...

18:24.542 --> 18:26.542
That was too much, wasn't it?
Yeah.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.041
I know, it felt weird
coming out of my mouth.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.000
( upbeat lounge music playing )

18:44.333 --> 18:45.750
( bell dings )

19:03.583 --> 19:07.083
Wasn't that our floor?

19:07.125 --> 19:09.041
Mm.

19:09.083 --> 19:10.583
( bell rings )

19:27.834 --> 19:32.291
Whew. You're hot, you cook,
are you married?

19:32.333 --> 19:34.500
No.
Ha, ha.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.208
You wanna get married,

19:36.250 --> 19:38.792
or could we just pretend
it's our honeymoon all morning?

19:38.834 --> 19:40.625
( chuckles )

19:40.667 --> 19:42.583
I was kidding about the married.
Ha, ha.

19:42.625 --> 19:43.959
Oh, no, I knew that.
I know.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.166
I should probably
get going to work.

19:46.208 --> 19:47.500
Do you wanna
hang out again?

19:47.542 --> 19:50.041
Yeah.

19:50.083 --> 19:53.000
Yeah.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.834
No.

19:55.875 --> 19:58.208
So, what? You are married?

19:58.250 --> 20:00.458
No, I'm-- I just...

20:00.500 --> 20:03.458
I just got out of something.
Ahem.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.792
And you're stuck on her?

20:05.834 --> 20:09.625
She is stuck in my head.
I'm not stuck.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.000
You know, I'm not the guy that
just leaves without calling.

20:13.041 --> 20:16.458
I mean, I always call.
I've always called.

20:16.500 --> 20:20.583
But I just--
You seem really great.

20:20.625 --> 20:25.041
And I just-- I kind
of wanna know,

20:25.083 --> 20:28.458
you know, what would happen
if I decided to

20:28.500 --> 20:31.083
do things different
than I've always done.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.041
Because what I've always done

20:34.083 --> 20:35.667
doesn't seem to work.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.500
Again, it's too much.

20:43.917 --> 20:46.917
I have something on my mind.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.709
Me too.
You first.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.500
No, you go.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.542
Ahem. Am I like...? Um...

21:00.083 --> 21:03.041
If I wasn't your husband
and you saw me at a bar,

21:03.083 --> 21:05.083
would you hit on me?

21:05.125 --> 21:06.542
Ow. I'm serious.

21:06.583 --> 21:07.917
Let me guess.

21:07.959 --> 21:11.083
The bachelors' night with
the boys got you all nostalgic?

21:11.125 --> 21:15.959
I do not miss being a bachelor
and I love being married.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.667
There was a lot of attention
being doled out,

21:17.709 --> 21:19.500
and none of it
was coming my way.

21:19.542 --> 21:21.333
Do I not give you
enough attention?

21:21.375 --> 21:22.709
That's not the point.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.583
What is the point?

21:26.083 --> 21:28.667
I'm not sure.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.750
Cooper, you are
a handsome man,

21:30.792 --> 21:32.792
and if you didn't have
a ring on your finger,

21:32.834 --> 21:36.083
you'd have to beat
those hussies off with a stick.

21:38.083 --> 21:41.375
Thank you.
Hmm.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.041
Would you have sex
with me?

21:44.083 --> 21:48.000
I am not one of those hussies.
Damn it.

21:49.583 --> 21:53.125
You think we have enough space
in the loft?

21:53.166 --> 21:54.458
What do you mean?

21:54.500 --> 21:57.041
Mason's been spending
a lot of time there

21:57.083 --> 21:59.583
and I was thinking
he may want it to be

21:59.625 --> 22:01.667
more than just a weekend
thing at some point.

22:01.709 --> 22:05.041
I was looking on the Internet
and there are these partitions

22:05.083 --> 22:06.583
we could install
in the living room maybe.

22:06.625 --> 22:09.375
We could build Mason his own
man cave. He would love that.

22:09.417 --> 22:11.625
( chuckles )

22:14.083 --> 22:18.000
So you're pretty into Mason
these days--

22:24.333 --> 22:26.917
Are you feeling
like a hussy now?

22:26.959 --> 22:29.208
Don't push your luck.

22:32.208 --> 22:34.750
We've gotten threats.

22:34.792 --> 22:36.625
The stuff in the papers?

22:36.667 --> 22:38.208
Everyone's trying
to twist this around

22:38.250 --> 22:40.125
like Aaron's
some rogue cop.

22:40.166 --> 22:41.667
That must be hard.
Yeah.

22:41.709 --> 22:45.041
We'll be fine.

22:45.083 --> 22:47.542
Do you wanna know what he did
that day before the shooting?

22:47.583 --> 22:50.583
He drove a kid from corner
to corner to find his mom

22:50.625 --> 22:53.417
because she left in the middle
of the night to buy drugs.

22:53.458 --> 22:55.542
SISSY:
That didn't make the papers.

22:55.583 --> 22:58.041
He's a good man.

22:58.083 --> 23:01.250
He doesn't deserve this.
No, Sissy. Can you, um...?

23:03.083 --> 23:06.959
I need a moment alone
with Dr. Wallace, okay?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.667
SISSY:
Okay.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.709
( melancholy pop music playing )

23:22.083 --> 23:23.875
So...

23:24.917 --> 23:26.792
What have you decided?

23:26.834 --> 23:28.917
( sighs )

23:28.959 --> 23:31.458
I'm sorry. I don't think you're
ready to be back on the street.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.291
I am ready.

23:34.333 --> 23:38.041
I am. Please let me
get back to work.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.500
It must feel like the whole
world is watching you,

23:40.542 --> 23:43.625
maybe even against you,
but you can't worry about Sissy

23:43.667 --> 23:45.208
or Joe or anyone else.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.542
You've had a major trauma,
and I think it's important

23:47.583 --> 23:49.041
that we continue
to talk about it.

23:49.083 --> 23:52.208
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

23:52.250 --> 23:57.041
You know, growing up, the cops
in my neighborhood were jerks.

23:57.083 --> 23:59.667
Just because they could be.

23:59.709 --> 24:02.458
You know? And I thought...

24:03.542 --> 24:04.959
I thought I could be
a better cop.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.542
A better person
than that.

24:07.583 --> 24:12.291
See, I don't know how to sit
around my house.

24:12.333 --> 24:15.041
I know how to be a cop.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.750
Okay, I wanna get you to the
point where you can do your job

24:17.792 --> 24:20.125
and still have a healthy outlet
for your emotions.

24:20.166 --> 24:22.166
How is that possible?

24:22.208 --> 24:24.500
Without work to keep my focus,

24:24.542 --> 24:27.583
all I do is sit around
and I replay that night.

24:29.083 --> 24:30.959
And, uh...

24:32.750 --> 24:34.000
And what do you see?

24:39.083 --> 24:42.458
I see his face.
That's natural.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.458
You didn't have a choice.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.250
It's okay to let yourself
off the hook, Aaron.

24:48.291 --> 24:49.834
Is it?

24:51.083 --> 24:53.000
You can talk to me.

24:57.959 --> 25:01.291
I see his face,
Dr. Wallace.

25:02.250 --> 25:06.417
It was dark.
There was a shadow.

25:07.458 --> 25:09.625
I got spooked.

25:11.542 --> 25:15.166
And when I opened my eyes,
he was on the ground.

25:17.208 --> 25:21.166
And I told the investigators
he reached, but, uh...

25:26.166 --> 25:28.000
It's okay.

25:30.709 --> 25:32.709
I was scared.

25:35.083 --> 25:37.792
I was scared.

25:37.834 --> 25:42.000
And now I can't get
his face out of my head.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.000
I am sorry.

25:48.083 --> 25:51.041
I am so, so sorry.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.709
I just spent two hours
on the phone

26:08.750 --> 26:10.375
trying to convince Aaron
not to quit.

26:10.417 --> 26:13.458
I said I needed more time
with him.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.500
Shut the door.

26:20.959 --> 26:22.291
I thought you'd do right
by him.

26:22.333 --> 26:24.041
You thought
I'd rubber stamp him.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.875
You knew that his story
was bogus.

26:30.583 --> 26:34.500
This guy Aaron shot?
He was 19 years old.

26:34.542 --> 26:36.250
But you probably read that,
right?

26:36.291 --> 26:37.667
You know what
you didn't read?

26:37.709 --> 26:40.291
The first time he comes
into the system, he's 11.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.750
Beats up an old man
at a bus stop for $9.

26:42.792 --> 26:45.041
Nine bucks, Shelly.
Three years in juvie,

26:45.083 --> 26:48.041
where he distinguished himself
by his ability to make shanks.

26:48.083 --> 26:49.500
He almost killed a kid
in there.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.542
Now six weeks after he finally
gets out,

26:51.583 --> 26:54.041
he robs a liquor store.
The list goes on.

26:54.083 --> 26:56.041
You think that justifies
my lying to protect Aaron?

26:56.083 --> 26:58.500
You think you're protecting him
by keeping him off the street?

26:58.542 --> 27:00.041
I'm telling you,

27:00.083 --> 27:02.291
the only way this kid makes it
is by putting on his uniform

27:02.333 --> 27:04.500
and getting back out there.
No, you are wrong, Joe.

27:04.542 --> 27:06.000
He is not doing well.

27:06.041 --> 27:09.792
None of us are doing well,
Shelly. That's the joke.

27:12.583 --> 27:16.542
It's a brutal job,
and we do the best we can.

27:16.583 --> 27:19.166
But if we were to stop
and think about what we do

27:19.208 --> 27:22.083
and why and try
to make some sense of it,

27:22.125 --> 27:24.542
you'd have a line of us
outside your door a mile long.

27:24.583 --> 27:27.875
Well, then maybe
I should have a line.

27:27.917 --> 27:30.917
Aaron doesn't go back
to work until I say so.

27:39.583 --> 27:42.709
What am I looking at?
A gliosarcoma.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.709
Neuro docs
go their entire careers

27:44.750 --> 27:45.917
without ever seeing
one of these,

27:45.959 --> 27:47.625
and I sniffed it out
while suturing a hand.

27:47.667 --> 27:50.333
Well, congratulations.
What does it mean?

27:50.375 --> 27:52.583
These things are nasty.
They are the only tumor

27:52.625 --> 27:54.959
that can actually push out
of the brain through the skull.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.583
If the cells come into contact
with any other part of the body,

27:57.625 --> 28:00.291
the tumor grows there,
making them nearly inoperable.

28:01.667 --> 28:02.875
How long?

28:04.125 --> 28:06.041
I'd need updated scans
to be sure,

28:06.083 --> 28:07.333
but we're talking
a few months.

28:07.375 --> 28:12.250
This specialist
gives her six to nine.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.834
Is there anything
you can do?

28:19.667 --> 28:20.792
No.

28:24.792 --> 28:26.792
( tense theme playing )

28:37.667 --> 28:39.667
Hey.
Hey.

28:39.709 --> 28:40.583
I called you last night.

28:40.625 --> 28:42.041
You left Bonky Bear
at your place.

28:42.083 --> 28:43.250
I know. I saw.

28:43.291 --> 28:45.458
I was out with, uh--
Jake and Cooper.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.250
We were trying to get Sam's
mind off of Addison.

28:47.291 --> 28:49.500
Mm. How did that go?

28:49.542 --> 28:51.667
It's Sam. I mean...
I know.

28:51.709 --> 28:54.709
Addison is not a bastion of
mental health these days either.

28:54.750 --> 28:57.041
The next two people who get
together at this practice--

28:57.083 --> 28:59.166
Should be fired
immediately.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.750
( both laugh )

29:01.834 --> 29:03.625
So how was it?
What do you mean?

29:03.667 --> 29:05.583
Last night.
The boys' night out.

29:05.625 --> 29:08.709
Oh. Oh, it was good.
Fun. Yeah.

29:09.875 --> 29:12.458
What?
What did you think I meant?

29:13.667 --> 29:15.291
Nothing.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.458
What did you do
last night?

29:16.500 --> 29:18.959
Violet, that's--
No, no, no. What?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.667
Were you with someone?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Oh, God, you were with someone.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.750
Oh, wow.

29:29.792 --> 29:32.041
Go ahead.

29:32.083 --> 29:34.041
With what?
With your objection to me seeing

29:34.083 --> 29:35.542
other people
while we're separated.

29:35.583 --> 29:36.542
How old was she?

29:36.583 --> 29:37.709
Violet--
No, really.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.834
Was she a waitress or a girl
that goes to the club--

29:39.875 --> 29:42.250
Stop deflecting.
I'm not deflecting.

29:42.291 --> 29:45.458
Congratulations on your--
Whatever it was.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.917
So you're okay
if I see other people?

29:48.959 --> 29:51.250
We're separated, right?

29:54.083 --> 29:56.750
Okay. I'll bring back
Bonky Bear tonight.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.083
Okay.

30:15.959 --> 30:17.959
( sobbing )

30:29.750 --> 30:32.458
( upbeat pop music playing )

30:36.583 --> 30:38.709
Did you know the guys
went out last night?

30:38.750 --> 30:39.500
Really?

30:39.542 --> 30:42.041
So Sam could get
his mind off you.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.583
That's why
he didn't come home.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.959
I was up all night again.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.500
I did not hear the garage open,
I did not see the lights go on.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.709
I feel like Pete
is using this separation

30:50.750 --> 30:52.583
to have the bachelor party
that he never had.

30:52.625 --> 30:56.709
You know, he wants
to sow his wild, old oats.

30:56.750 --> 30:59.000
He told you that?
Yeah.

30:59.041 --> 31:01.917
I pretended not to care.
Do you?

31:04.083 --> 31:06.208
Well, I don't want to.
I mean, intellectually,

31:06.250 --> 31:09.625
I understand where Pete
is coming from, but emotionally,

31:09.667 --> 31:12.583
I haven't processed him
being with other women yet.

31:12.625 --> 31:14.166
Does he think our marriage
is over?

31:14.208 --> 31:16.417
Maybe he has a different idea
of what separation is.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.667
You know?
You prefer sleeping sideways.

31:18.709 --> 31:22.750
He prefers sowing
his wild, old oats.

31:22.792 --> 31:25.792
Look, a part of me hopes
that Sam moves on.

31:25.834 --> 31:28.000
You know? I mean, I wonder

31:28.041 --> 31:32.250
if I held him hostage, you know,
with all the baby stuff.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.542
You're trying to be happy.
Maybe Pete is too.

31:39.417 --> 31:42.041
Hey. What's up?

31:42.083 --> 31:43.667
I know about the tumor.

31:43.709 --> 31:45.083
What?
I know.

31:45.125 --> 31:48.208
How?
I just-- I know.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.166
You've no idea
what you're talking about.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.917
I do.

31:51.959 --> 31:55.709
You need help.
No, what I need

31:55.750 --> 31:59.041
is time, and I'm not
gonna waste it

31:59.083 --> 32:01.125
chasing some cure
that doesn't exist.

32:01.166 --> 32:02.667
You have to tell Cooper.

32:02.709 --> 32:04.125
( scoffs )

32:04.166 --> 32:06.625
I don't have control
over this thing,

32:06.667 --> 32:09.041
but I have control over
when I tell Mason

32:09.083 --> 32:11.041
and destroy his childhood.

32:11.083 --> 32:12.750
He won't say anything.
He won't have to.

32:12.792 --> 32:14.208
He'll just look at him

32:14.250 --> 32:16.875
like a kid whose mom
is dying and Mason will know.

32:16.917 --> 32:20.250
Look, I understand that.
I do.

32:20.291 --> 32:22.041
But you are family
to Cooper now.

32:22.083 --> 32:24.291
He needs time to prepare.
You need to listen to me.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.834
You're gonna keep
your mouth shut.

32:25.875 --> 32:28.041
Because if you mention one word
of this to Cooper,

32:28.083 --> 32:30.041
I will take my son
and disappear,

32:30.083 --> 32:32.291
and Cooper will
never see him again.

32:45.083 --> 32:46.792
Nice.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.333
Nice.

32:50.375 --> 32:52.500
Hey, come here. Ahem.

32:52.542 --> 32:54.041
Put your two fingers
over the seam

32:54.083 --> 32:55.583
and let your wrist
roll over it.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.583
Got it, Dad.

32:57.625 --> 33:00.625
Teaching him the curve, huh?
Yeah.

33:00.667 --> 33:04.000
Used to be enough to take
my mind off of things.

33:04.041 --> 33:06.041
Yeah, well, silence
has a way of eating at you

33:06.083 --> 33:08.125
until there's nothing left.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.875
I think what
you need to consider

33:09.917 --> 33:11.709
is whether you can keep
this one inside

33:11.750 --> 33:14.625
and still be the man
and the cop that you wanna be.

33:14.667 --> 33:18.000
If I rat myself out,
I'll be letting everyone down.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.166
Look, Joe would never
talk to me again.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.709
Yeah, maybe.

33:23.750 --> 33:25.583
My father
was a brilliant surgeon,

33:25.625 --> 33:26.625
one of the best in his field.

33:26.667 --> 33:29.583
And I wanted to be that too.
For him.

33:29.625 --> 33:31.750
But I failed in the worst
possible way.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.583
Imagine trying
to be a world-class surgeon

33:33.625 --> 33:36.709
when you can't stomach
the sight of blood.

33:36.750 --> 33:39.041
Coming to terms with the fact
I wasn't gonna be the person

33:39.083 --> 33:43.542
he wanted me to be, it was hard,
I won't lie to you.

33:43.583 --> 33:46.041
But I'm better for it.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.959
Yeah, well, I wouldn't know
how to do that.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.041
Well, I do. If I don't sign off
on your psych eval,

33:52.083 --> 33:53.250
you're off the force.

33:53.291 --> 33:55.000
At least for a while.

33:55.041 --> 33:59.125
It'll make getting back on very
difficult. Maybe impossible.

33:59.166 --> 34:01.834
But if I do it

34:01.875 --> 34:03.959
it's not the best way.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.333
Because at the end of the day,

34:05.375 --> 34:06.875
you're the one
who has to live with it.

34:10.417 --> 34:12.875
( tender acoustic theme
playing )

34:17.709 --> 34:20.041
You still sulking?

34:20.083 --> 34:22.083
I'm not sulking.

34:22.125 --> 34:24.041
Too much energy.

34:24.083 --> 34:28.208
I am too far past exhaustion
to sulk.

34:28.250 --> 34:31.000
Looks like sulking from here.
You know what you are?

34:31.041 --> 34:32.917
You're a peddler.

34:32.959 --> 34:35.792
A baby peddler. It is.
Is that right?

34:35.834 --> 34:39.667
And you're probably here to give
me some sort of pep talk where,

34:39.709 --> 34:42.041
to summarize, you'll tell me
to get back on the horse.

34:42.083 --> 34:45.041
You're a peddler.
Ha, ha.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.667
Are you getting back together
with Sam?

34:47.709 --> 34:49.834
Why would you ask that?

34:49.875 --> 34:52.542
Well, you gave Sam up
because you wanted a baby,

34:52.583 --> 34:54.083
and if you're not
getting back together,

34:54.125 --> 34:57.208
then a baby is still
what you want.

34:57.250 --> 34:58.834
Give me your hand.
What?

34:58.875 --> 35:01.041
Until you have a baby,
I consider you my patient.

35:01.083 --> 35:04.125
Give me your hand.
Okay.

35:05.792 --> 35:07.834
( Addison clears throat )

35:07.875 --> 35:10.041
I have heard every word
of this before.

35:10.083 --> 35:13.041
And I have told women when
it's time to throw in the towel.

35:13.083 --> 35:17.709
And you are not there yet.
You're not even close.

35:17.750 --> 35:19.834
If you want this,
we can make this happen.

35:19.875 --> 35:22.709
I know you felt alone
in this before,

35:22.750 --> 35:24.250
but you don't need
to feel that way anymore,

35:24.291 --> 35:26.041
because you've got me.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.834
I will always be there,
Addison.

35:31.834 --> 35:34.125
You say that
to all your patients?

35:35.834 --> 35:37.709
Not all of it.

35:50.083 --> 35:55.333
I just almost
fell asleep.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.500
You've got some balls.

36:11.542 --> 36:12.917
I came for Aaron.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.125
Well, you've already
done enough for him.

36:15.166 --> 36:17.166
He's giving himself up.
Know what that means?

36:17.208 --> 36:19.792
If he's lucky enough
to somehow avoid prison,

36:19.834 --> 36:21.542
he loses his badge,
his pension,

36:21.583 --> 36:23.000
and everything
he's ever worked for.

36:23.041 --> 36:25.208
He'll be lucky to wind up
flipping burgers

36:25.250 --> 36:28.750
at some fast-food joint.
You screwed him.

36:28.792 --> 36:31.041
And you screwed me.
We've been friends a long time.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.583
Not anymore. The next time
you need a cop, don't call me.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.709
This is the right thing to do,
whether you see it now or not.

36:47.500 --> 36:51.041
You stealing supplies?
Oh, hey.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.333
What are you doing here?

36:53.375 --> 36:57.041
I-- Ha, ha. I was gonna say that
I was here to see Mr. Bauer,

36:57.083 --> 36:59.041
but really I was hoping
to find you.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.458
That's very sweet.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.458
I'm assuming you're
not being patronizing.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.041
Mm-mm.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.625
Um, I was wondering,
is it too late

37:07.667 --> 37:09.041
for me to take you
up on your offer?

37:09.083 --> 37:12.417
Um, I need to finish
stealing supplies

37:12.458 --> 37:14.917
for my rig
and take a shower.

37:14.959 --> 37:18.208
Give me an hour?
All right.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.250
( knocking on doorframe )

37:27.750 --> 37:30.458
Will you help me
find a surrogate?

37:30.500 --> 37:32.000
Absolutely.

37:36.959 --> 37:38.625
VIOLET:
So they really called you "Bus"?

37:38.667 --> 37:40.041
( Scott laughs )

37:40.083 --> 37:43.291
Um, my brother is older,
and he and his friends

37:43.333 --> 37:45.667
used to play tackle football
out behind our house,

37:45.709 --> 37:47.333
and I always wanted to play,

37:47.375 --> 37:51.041
as the younger brother,
but, you know, my mom said,

37:51.083 --> 37:54.417
"You're too young
and you're gonna get hurt."

37:54.458 --> 37:59.834
So one day I went,
I put a bucket over my head

37:59.875 --> 38:01.750
and I just ran out
on the field

38:01.792 --> 38:03.500
and I said,
"I'm gonna bus them.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.041
I'm gonna bus them up."
Ha, ha.

38:05.083 --> 38:08.834
And so the name "Bus"
was born.

38:08.875 --> 38:12.000
I broke my collarbone
that day.

38:12.041 --> 38:14.625
Needed to have surgery.

38:17.291 --> 38:18.834
How old are you?

38:29.542 --> 38:31.542
I'm 29.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.750
( mellow pop music playing )

38:47.125 --> 38:52.542
MASON:
Comrade. C-O-M-R-A-D-E.
Comrade.

38:54.959 --> 38:58.041
MASON: Did I get it?
Sorry.

38:58.083 --> 39:00.166
Uh, yeah.
Knocked you out again.

39:00.208 --> 39:01.875
( sighs )

39:01.917 --> 39:03.959
All right. I don't think
I can take any more tonight.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.041
Why don't you get washed up

39:05.083 --> 39:07.250
and we'll watch a little TV,
okay?

39:10.667 --> 39:12.000
What's going on
with you?

39:12.041 --> 39:16.041
Usually you love to watch me
get thrashed by an 8-year-old.

39:16.083 --> 39:19.000
I'm just... I'm tired.

39:20.583 --> 39:22.709
Charlotte,
what's wrong?

39:26.041 --> 39:28.875
I love you.
So do I.

39:32.625 --> 39:33.875
( knocking on door )

39:44.000 --> 39:46.875
COOPER:
Hey. Tonight's my night.

39:46.917 --> 39:49.458
Yes, I just--

39:49.500 --> 39:52.500
Could we go somewhere to talk?
Just you and me?

40:04.083 --> 40:06.000
Where's my dad?

40:06.041 --> 40:07.500
Uh...

40:07.542 --> 40:10.166
He'll be back in a minute. Um...

40:10.208 --> 40:11.667
You want another word?

40:11.709 --> 40:14.083
Sure.

40:14.125 --> 40:15.667
Uh...

40:19.041 --> 40:23.166
The word is acceptable.

40:23.208 --> 40:28.542
Acceptable. A-C-C-E-P-T-A-B-L-E.

40:28.583 --> 40:30.542
Acceptable.

40:40.792 --> 40:41.875
( sighs )

40:48.083 --> 40:51.041
How have you been?
Okay.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.917
You?

40:56.000 --> 40:58.083
I haven't been sleeping.

41:00.625 --> 41:01.709
Me either.

41:03.166 --> 41:07.709
I mean, the winner was literally
hobbled by the end.

41:07.750 --> 41:11.500
And he did this all for 50 bucks
and a boot filled with beer.

41:11.542 --> 41:15.583
I mean, the guy is either
a glutton for punishment

41:15.625 --> 41:18.583
or he just really likes
drinking beer out of a boot.

41:18.625 --> 41:20.750
THERAPIST:
Which do you think it was?

41:20.792 --> 41:24.667
I don't know. Ha, ha. Both.

41:24.709 --> 41:28.542
I guess if you want something
badly enough,

41:28.583 --> 41:32.000
then maybe getting your shins
pummeled is a fair price.

41:33.583 --> 41:35.667
I want a baby.

41:37.208 --> 41:39.458
I'm gonna have a baby.

41:48.083 --> 41:50.000
( upbeat theme playing )
