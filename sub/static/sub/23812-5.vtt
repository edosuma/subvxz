00:06.340 --> 00:08.140
Okay, when Sir Gareth
asked for two volunteers,

00:08.242 --> 00:09.641
I thought we'd be fighting dragons,

00:09.744 --> 00:12.177
not scraping gum.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.347
I would totally ban
the Bubblegum Festival,

00:15.449 --> 00:17.182
if it wasn't so delicious.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.619
Ohhh...

00:20.721 --> 00:23.055
this one has a tooth in it.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.458
You know you're scraping it all wrong.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.161
There's no wrong way to scrape gum.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.897
Please! A monkey
could scrape better than you.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.766
Hey! Some monkey quit this job.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.501
That's why we're here.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.769
Just watch what I do

00:36.871 --> 00:38.604
and try to be half as good.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.673
Are we about to get into a scrape off?

00:41.776 --> 00:43.308
I started two seconds ago.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.178
Princess?

00:46.280 --> 00:48.013
Oh, no, my dad. Time out.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.882
There's no time outs in a scrape off.

00:49.984 --> 00:53.052
Well, good luck
winning without your ladder.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.653
What are you...?

01:00.428 --> 01:03.062
Princess, where are you?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.430
Hey, Dad!

01:04.532 --> 01:05.631
What's up?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.833
[laughing] Fantastic news.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.268
The Wolf Platoon is returning from

01:09.370 --> 01:11.403
the battle against Ryker's evil forces,

01:11.505 --> 01:14.673
which means...
My sister is coming to visit!

01:14.775 --> 01:16.775
BOTH: Yay!

01:16.877 --> 01:18.844
Why are they returning?

01:18.946 --> 01:20.679
Did they find the Armor of Astoria?

01:20.781 --> 01:21.980
We don't know.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.816
They just said they have
news to deliver in person.

01:23.918 --> 01:24.950
I can't wait.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.785
It's been a year since I've seen Eliza.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.153
I miss her so much.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.956
I haven't had anyone to talk
to about princess stuff.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.825
But I can talk princess all day.

01:32.927 --> 01:37.096
OMG, your tiara is fire! [snaps fingers]

01:37.198 --> 01:41.300
Aw, that's so cute when
you try to be a teenaged girl.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.503
So, what are your plans
for Eliza's reception?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.838
Uh...

01:45.940 --> 01:48.140
Oh, my goblin, you didn't plan anything?

01:48.242 --> 01:49.708
We have to get started.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.711
Hello?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.315
You forgot me.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.717
Fine.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.753
I can win the scrape off one handed.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.388
[grunts]

02:03.691 --> 02:04.690
Oh!

[magic whooshing]

02:20.074 --> 02:21.273
What are they doing?

02:21.375 --> 02:23.775
Hm, they're practicing
for the Tasty Trunk

02:23.878 --> 02:25.644
Pixie Pong Tournament.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.613
I know I fell in a gum bucket earlier,

02:27.715 --> 02:29.848
but do they know they're
playing without a ball?

02:31.185 --> 02:32.117
Yeah, I don't ask questions

02:32.219 --> 02:33.719
I don't wanna know the answer to.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.555
Sage and Buttercup always beat me

02:36.657 --> 02:38.357
because I had the wrong partner.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.325
I lost three years in a row...

02:40.427 --> 02:42.761
four, if you wanna count past three.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.132
But now he has a secret weapon.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.934
Fizz is skipping
the Shark Jousting Festival

02:49.036 --> 02:50.502
so he can be my partner.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.605
Is that sharks riding horses
or knights riding sharks?

02:55.676 --> 02:56.909
Both! [laughing]

02:59.847 --> 03:02.047
This is my last chance to
win the Pixie Pong Tournament

03:02.149 --> 03:03.549
before I'm too old to enter.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.518
Which means this is
my last chance to beat you.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.688
Oh, do you remember last
year when I made you cry?

03:11.292 --> 03:12.558
It was allergy season.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.494
[giggling] My allergies make me sneeze.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.963
[giggling] But I call them nose farts.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.332
Students, as you may have heard,

03:20.434 --> 03:23.168
Wolf Platoon is returning
from battling Ryker's army.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.469
STUDENTS: Yeah!

03:24.572 --> 03:26.038
But you still have class today.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.372
I thought you'd just like to know.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.874
STUDENTS: Awww...

03:32.880 --> 03:34.613
Did you hear that?
My sister's coming home.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.216
She's my hero and the whole
reason I wanna become a knight.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.651
She sounds awesome... unlike you.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.255
What dragon flew up your butt?

03:43.357 --> 03:44.489
You never came back.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.825
I fell in your gum bucket
and swallowed my gum,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.127
and somebody else's gum.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.762
Okay, so, I forgot.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.232
You didn't forget.
You knew I was gonna beat you.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.733
[laughing] In your dreams.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.636
In my dreams, I'm a Yeti who
plays professional basketball.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.072
You'd probably lose at that, too.

04:00.174 --> 04:01.707
[gong rings]

04:01.809 --> 04:02.908
What is that?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.676
That is my get-along gong...

04:04.778 --> 04:07.446
not to be confused with
my you-done-me-wrong gong.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.616
That one has more of a...
of a country music twang.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.385
Now a little competition is healthy.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.520
But it cannot get
in the way of your friendship.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.389
[laughing] See? You're confused.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.825
We're not friends. Yeah.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.293
We're just two people

04:21.394 --> 04:23.228
who have the same color
shoulder thingies.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.130
- They're called pauldrons.
- You're a pauldron!

04:25.232 --> 04:27.266
Uh! Stop it!

04:27.368 --> 04:30.636
Look, squad mates must be friends,

04:30.738 --> 04:32.237
otherwise, how can you have each other's

04:32.339 --> 04:33.872

04:33.974 --> 04:37.142
Fizz, release the magical
friendship bracelets.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.644

- Hey! Let go of me!
- You let go of me!

04:48.756 --> 04:50.756
[laughing] Those bracelets
will keep you bound together

04:50.858 --> 04:54.293
until you two can learn
how to become friends.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.994
What if that never happens?

Well, then, you'll be stuck
together forever like...

to pull these bracelets apart.

Yeah, that does seem a lot easier
