11:21.719 --> 11:24.737
I was so worried about making
this story not about Jacqueline

11:24.743 --> 11:28.344
but I don't think it's
gonna be a problem.

11:28.379 --> 11:29.745
Oh, yeah? Tell me.

11:29.781 --> 11:31.647
Well, there are so many women

11:31.683 --> 11:33.516
who have spoken out
and are inspiring others

11:33.551 --> 11:34.684

I already have so many
people who I've interviewed

a really positive piece.

11:42.861 --> 11:44.594
That's great.

11:44.629 --> 11:47.396

was actually impressed.

11:47.432 --> 11:48.631
How did the photo shoot go?

11:48.666 --> 11:50.666
Well, at first I was really nervous,

11:50.702 --> 11:52.768
but then after seeing Jacqueline

11:52.804 --> 11:56.372
I just remembered how much I like her.

The whole thing
was really nice, actually.

11:59.510 --> 12:05.348
I don't know. I was so angry at her
for not bringing me back, but...

the truth is... is she was right.

12:07.785 --> 12:09.685

12:09.721 --> 12:12.488

that he was still single.
So we reconnected.

So was there someone in particular

20:01.834 --> 20:04.501
who inspired you to come forward?

20:04.537 --> 20:08.739
Well, I think it's great
that Jacqueline Carlyle spoke out.

20:08.774 --> 20:11.442
She is very inspiring.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.512
I was an assistant at "News Today,"

20:15.548 --> 20:19.616
which is the same news magazine
that Jacqueline worked at when...

20:19.652 --> 20:21.418
when she was assaulted.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.587
Were you there at the
same time as Jacqueline?

20:23.622 --> 20:27.424
No, I was there five years after her.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.593
But...

20:29.628 --> 20:32.863
he was still there.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.770
And he assaulted me too.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.675
That...

20:44.710 --> 20:46.844
That is terrible. I'm so sorry.

20:49.782 --> 20:53.851
Um, I hope you don't mind me
asking this, but...

20:53.886 --> 20:57.554
how do you know that
it's the same person?

20:57.590 --> 21:00.424
Jacqueline never named her attacker.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.493
She didn't have to.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.662
The way she described
him and the attack...

21:05.698 --> 21:07.664
it was all the same.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.807
I thought I had closure
when he died a few years ago,

21:09.903 --> 21:13.871
but then I saw your article
about Jacqueline, and...

21:13.906 --> 21:16.540
everything came back.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.810
That must have been awful.

21:19.845 --> 21:23.680
I know it's hard to speak about assault,
let alone report it.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.550
But I didn't come forward either.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.820
For many of the same
reasons Jacqueline didn't.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.625
But learning that another woman was...

21:34.660 --> 21:37.828
assaulted before me is...

21:37.863 --> 21:39.830
it's complicated.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.282
I don't know, I just can't help

21:41.368 --> 21:42.987
but wonder what would have
happened if Jacqueline

21:43.003 --> 21:45.202
had spoken up sooner.

21:45.228 --> 21:47.504
I guess what I'm saying is,
reading your story

21:47.540 --> 21:50.474
made me realize how
important it is to speak up.

21:52.361 --> 21:54.778
Not just for ourselves, but...

21:54.813 --> 21:57.447
for future victims.

I'm really excited about.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.718
Which, you know,
it hasn't been very easy

22:34.753 --> 22:37.487

22:54.773 --> 22:56.773
Okay.

23:05.417 --> 23:08.385
So I... [clears throat]

23:08.420 --> 23:11.388
kissed another woman last night.

23:12.424 --> 23:14.491
And it didn't mean anything.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.560
It was just this random girl.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.528
It was at Habit Forming.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.665
You know,
and we were drinking and dancing

23:21.700 --> 23:25.736

23:25.771 --> 23:29.573
- The thing is...
- The thing is?

23:30.542 --> 23:35.412
I also had this dream.

23:35.447 --> 23:38.415
About Leila.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.784

23:40.819 --> 23:43.754

23:43.789 --> 23:46.757
And, I've been thinking
about other women.

23:47.893 --> 23:49.693
The only reason why
I'm telling you this stuff

23:49.728 --> 23:51.828
is because I can't lie to you.

23:54.466 --> 23:56.533
I'm just so confused, you know,

23:56.568 --> 23:59.503
and I'm trying...
trying to wrap my head around this.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.842
Wait... can...
hey, can we please just talk about this?

24:05.878 --> 24:09.446
I can't. I, uh... I have to go.

any of my calls or texts.

Oh, love,
she's just getting her head straight.

24:22.673 --> 24:24.640

that woman's story in your follow-up?

24:33.851 --> 24:36.385
I don't know. [sighs]

24:36.420 --> 24:38.553
It could devastate Jacqueline.

24:38.589 --> 24:40.722
I mean, how do you tell a woman
that the man who assaulted her

24:40.758 --> 24:43.825
did the same thing to
someone else years later?

24:43.861 --> 24:47.796
But, Elena's story is part
of Jacqueline's story now, so...

24:47.831 --> 24:50.532
Yeah, that's hard.
