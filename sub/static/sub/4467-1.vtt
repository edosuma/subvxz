01:08.160 --> 01:09.752
Hello.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.359
Look at him, Claire.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.039
I'm looking at him, Hailey.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.954
Sitting up there being gorgeous,
looking for someone to rescue.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.232
He should so be rescuing us.
Whas wrong with this picture?

02:30.440 --> 02:34.274
Well, all these articles say
we've been way too available.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.913
We need to be more coy.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.554
We're so coy
he barely knows we exist.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.712
Okay. Ray pop quiz.

02:40.920 --> 02:44.356
Favorite song? Favorite food?
Favorite drink? Go, go, go.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.672
Weezer's "Island in the Sun."

02:46.880 --> 02:49.030
- Dr Pepper. Oranges?
- Very nice.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.635
- I'm trying to read.
- Fine.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.638
Then read me
the latest on boy-bagging technology.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.752
Oh, okay. This one's called
"Fluff and Retreat."

02:57.960 --> 03:01.794
"Fluff his ego, then walk away.
Not only is he left wanting more...

03:02.000 --> 03:04.594
...but he's under the impression
that is his idea."

03:04.800 --> 03:07.598
- Nice.
- Thas really cool.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.592
Summer's almost over
and you haven't gone in the water once.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.677
Once would be way too many times.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.352
Excuse me.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.030
Do you realize we've got less than
five days until you have to move?

03:22.240 --> 03:24.470
I don't want you moving
halfway around the world.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.910
Claire, you're such a ruiner.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.714
I'd gone, like, a half-hour
without thinking about it.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.957
- Hailey, I'm sorry but...
- Besides, I haven't kissed Raymond yet.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.830
So I'm not going anywhere.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.958
Incoming.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.797
- Hello, hottie.
- Is Raymond.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.357
Hail, did you order a sand-witch?

03:49.560 --> 03:51.869
Cecilia's back from camp.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.514
Don't worry. He won't fall for yuck.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.472
He's way too smart for that.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.991
- Hey, Cecilia.
- Hey.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.713
Whoa.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.839
Did they get...

04:10.040 --> 04:11.314
...bigger?

04:11.520 --> 04:12.839
She could poke an eye out.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.395
We just...
We have to decode his body language.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.599
Look, is fine.
I mean, if he's into her...

04:18.800 --> 04:22.554
...he'll shake his hair, stretch his arms,
and flex those muscles.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.079
Yeah?

04:25.200 --> 04:27.919
- What was that?
- Fingers. Fingers through the hair.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.680
I mean, technically,
that wasn't shaking.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.359
Right?

04:35.960 --> 04:37.518
Please, gods of love, no shake.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.199
No stretch. No flex. No...

04:39.400 --> 04:41.277
- No...
- No, no...

04:42.520 --> 04:44.795
No.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.834
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.349
- Thanks. We're good.
- Yeah, thanks.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.199
Babysit much?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.274
I can't take it anymore.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.869
As long as he doesn't flip
his sunglasses we're fine.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.957
Hey, Ray, think fast.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.032
- I can't look anymore. You.
- Sorry.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.198
- I figured you could catch.
- You're right.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.349
What? Did he flip them?

05:11.560 --> 05:13.391
Is really sunny out.
It doesn't count.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.828
Yeah.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.313
- Say something.
- You'll never tan in those clothes.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.919
- Or skin cancer.
- Please. We don't even smoke.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.553
Such losers.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.592
The perfect end to a perfect day.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.472
Claire. Hailey. We need your help.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.199
Hey.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.996
- What?
- Oh, we've decided to fire Raymond.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.792
- What?
- What?

05:46.240 --> 05:48.800
- No. No, you can't.
- No. No.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.597
- You shoulďve seen your faces.
- That is so not funny.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.155
Oh, you girls, you're too wound up.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.113
Now, help bring in the Last Splash
decorations, please.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.151
Weatherman says
a big storm's coming.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.239
- We'll put them up again after it clears.
- Ray will still be there when you're done.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.714
Grandpa.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.440
Oh, supper's at 6, Claire.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.278
You'll come back
after dinner, right?

06:12.480 --> 06:15.278
- We can hang out in the rec room...
- No. I have other plans.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.471
What?
But you promised...

06:17.680 --> 06:20.672
- God, chill out. Your grandma's right.
- Hailey, I'm so...

06:20.880 --> 06:23.474
- Sorry.
- Jeez, Leonard.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.999
M or W?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.877
Right. Nice to see you too.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.397
W.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.276
He knows what you did last summer.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.798
Get...

07:03.560 --> 07:06.472
- Mom, I'm home.
- Hey, kiddo.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.158
Hailey, your boxes
won't pack themselves.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.636
Don't put this off
until the movers come.

07:20.360 --> 07:24.319
Come on, Moby. Don't play me like that.
I haven't seen you in days.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.474
Hailey, you can unpack as much
as you want. We're still moving.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.553
Yeah.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.632
How was the club?

07:34.840 --> 07:37.274
Maybe I could get more
than one syllable this time.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.708
It was fine.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.717
That was three.

07:45.320 --> 07:46.594
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.632
But you didn't want to leave Boston
either, remember?

07:52.320 --> 07:55.517
And look what happened.
You met Claire.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.713
You know, Australia could be
another amazing adventure for us, Hails.

08:02.120 --> 08:07.148
- How about we start packing your room?
- How about I live here until I'm 18?

08:07.360 --> 08:10.318
How about we go back
to fewer syllables?

08:11.440 --> 08:12.839
Cool.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.032
That was one.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.669
A storm warning
is in...

08:23.880 --> 08:27.111
So thas where Cecilia Banks gets
all the drama. Just look at her dad.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.436
Well, as you can see... Huh.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.316
Hailey, how am I supposed to face
eighth grade without you?

08:33.520 --> 08:35.669
My locker is right next
to the boys' bathroom.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.996
And I have co-ed PE class by myself.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.236
We have to dance
with Raymond at Last Splash.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.399
We'll be such great dancers that he'll
realize that he has to marry one of us.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.795
And we'll be so happy
that one of us got him...

08:47.000 --> 08:49.309
...that we won't even be jealous.
You know?

08:49.520 --> 08:52.592
Unless he picks you.
That wouldn't be okay.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.950
- Joke.
- What if this is our last camp-out?

08:55.920 --> 08:57.672
What if this is it?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.074
Oh, gods of hurricanes...

09:02.280 --> 09:05.511
...makers of thunder and lightning
and majestical waves...

09:05.720 --> 09:08.792
...useth your power to keep my mom
from moving to Australia.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.634
Maketh her to see
the error of her ways...

09:11.840 --> 09:15.196
...and keepeth us in Bay Bridge.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.633
Ameneth.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.116
- You're insane.
- Thas what they tell me.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.878
Yeah.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.354
Ameneth.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.353
Oh, my God.
The vending machine's possessed.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.032
- Looks like we got free...
- Hailey!

09:41.240 --> 09:43.595
...- soda?
- Where are you? You dead? Don't die.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.439
I'm not dead. I'm right here.
Follow my voice.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.552
Oh, God. Something's out there.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.869
Claire, I want you to know
that if Leonard comes...

09:54.080 --> 09:55.877
...and chops us
into a million pieces...

09:56.080 --> 10:00.119
...then you are totally, completely
and eternally my best friend.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.950
You're my best friend too.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.674
And I broke your iPod.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.990
What are you girls doing out here
in this weather? Come on.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.474
Grandma, you scared me.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.671
Les get the two of you
tucked up in bed.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.599
Mrs. B., if I have nightmares
tonight, I'm blaming you.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.998
Oh, gods of hurricanes, makers of
thunder and lightning...

10:36.640 --> 10:39.438
- Gods of hurricanes...
- Just take me now.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.479
Oh, gods of hurricanes, makers of
thunder and lightning...

10:42.680 --> 10:44.193
...and majestical waves.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.109
Please useth your powers
to keep my mom...

10:48.520 --> 10:53.992
Maketh her to see the error of her ways
and keepeth us in Bay Bridge.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.274
Oh, my God.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.394
- Come on, men.
- On three. You ready? One, two, three.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.713
Raymonďs out. Come on.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.478
Yeah, bring it up.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.198
- He's beautiful. Okay. Stay calm.
- Come on.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.315
- I'll catch you later, man.
- Yeah, catch you later.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.479
Look at this.

11:50.680 --> 11:54.275
- What a wreck.
- Is Ray. Don't look. Get down.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.639
Hello, little freaky blue crab.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.112
Claire, look.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.552
Ray. Hope you're ready to clean.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.712
Think you'll call off Last Splash?

12:09.120 --> 12:11.998
- No. No, Mr. B.
- No. Grandpa, no...

12:12.200 --> 12:13.838
Mr. B., I'm sorry,
you can't do that.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.873
Mr. B., we have been
planning for this for, like, ever.

12:17.080 --> 12:20.550
- Ill be all right.
- Grandpa? Are the pool lights still on?

12:28.640 --> 12:29.868
Claire.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.150
- Hold on.
- There's a shark in the pool.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.713
I got you. You're okay.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.353
Here, somebody get a chair.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.718
Calm down. There you go.
She may be in shock.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.672
- Take deep breaths.
- You all right?

13:10.960 --> 13:14.032
She gets scared in the water.
Her parents drowned.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.913
- You all right, honey?
- I saw something.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.998
Is in there, and...
I don't know what it was.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.350
Half the ocean washed up
in there last night.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.437
Hailey, take Claire inside.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.790
Leonard? Lock up the patio.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.959
- I don't want anyone else falling in.
- Okay. Clean it, lock it, got it.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.998
That was tight, Ray.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.999
Thanks, Ray.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.276
Well, come on.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.034
My God. Raymond totally
jumped in there to save you...

13:45.240 --> 13:47.151
...with his actual biceps.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.828
Did you feel them around you?
Were they flexed?

13:50.040 --> 13:52.190
Oh, God, they must have been flexed.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.551
If you had stopped breathing,
you were this close to mouth-to-mouth.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.837
There's something in there.
I'm serious.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.110
It looked like...
I can't even say it. But...

14:01.000 --> 14:03.753
...I swear, it just stared at me
with its eyes.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.234
You're in shock...

14:05.400 --> 14:06.833
...from touching Raymond.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.269
Hailey, I know what I saw.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.918
Fine. Then we'll just go back
when no one's looking and check it out.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.032
No way. I didn't mean
to get in the water in the first place...

14:19.240 --> 14:22.789
...and I'm not going back there again.
Something bad coulďve happened.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.274
Come on, Clairedy Cat.

14:24.920 --> 14:28.117
Put on your big-girl pants
and meet me at 9:00.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.511
Be careful.
Gram will be super mad at us.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.353
Is Leonard.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.153
Come on.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.518
Hey, maybe we should
get fishing poles or something.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.998
No. I don't want to catch it.
I want to feed it.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.115
- Fish sticks?
- Maybe it was an octopus.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.113
With blue hair and a tail?

15:34.320 --> 15:37.835
It coulďve been blue seaweed,
or kelp.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.355
It was not an octopus
and it wasn't kelp.

15:40.560 --> 15:42.198
- You want one?
- I saw hair.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.719
God.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.318
If you're gonna ignore every word I say
I can hang out alone.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.469
I'm not ignoring you.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.389
- I doubt myself. Don't doubt me too.
- You're getting hysterical over nothing.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.118
I bet I know what it was.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.398
I'm guessing...

15:59.600 --> 16:01.511
...it was a mermaid.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.359
Boo.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.919
Is a...

16:33.480 --> 16:34.833
You're a...

16:35.040 --> 16:36.519
A... a mer...

16:36.880 --> 16:39.952
I can see we have to take this slowly.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.515
Mer-maid.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.911
Mermaid.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.871
Fabled marine creature,
half woman, half fish...

16:49.160 --> 16:51.674
...known for sitting on rocks,
staring into mirrors...

16:51.880 --> 16:54.599
...and obsessively combing
our long, beautiful hair.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.791
Blah, blah, blah.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.396
Wha...? What is going on?

17:01.520 --> 17:05.035
Stop shrieking like a couple of gulls.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.953
For shrimps, you're awfully loud.

17:09.839 --> 17:11.478
- You speak English?
- Yeah.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.434
Mermaids speak every language
known to man, fish, crustacean...

17:15.640 --> 17:17.596
...and several varieties of seafowl.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.551
What can you speak?

17:19.760 --> 17:22.069
I got a C in Spanish.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.191
Wait. What if she's, like...

17:26.400 --> 17:28.630
...bad or something?
- Why would she be bad?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.155
She's a fictional sea creature.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.959
- They could be bad.
- We are not fictional.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.479
We're discrete.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.834
I've never been this close
to a human before.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.714
Yeah. Must be weird for you.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.719
What?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.038
Nothing.

17:56.520 --> 17:57.953
You're staring at my tail.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.035
- Well, yeah, I was.
- Do you...

18:01.240 --> 18:02.958
...want to touch it?

18:04.320 --> 18:05.958
Okay.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.516
Is slimy.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.759
Thank you. I rub it with kelp
and jellyfish twice a day.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.073
Please don't eat us.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.838
The thought.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.794
- Is okay.
- I want to see what feet feel like.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.274
Give it.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.757
Can you pick things up with them?

18:39.640 --> 18:42.108
No, but, I can kick with them
if you don't let go.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.957
Hey, get back here.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.639
How did you do that?

18:57.360 --> 18:59.794
Oh, thas nothing.
You should see my father.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.911
He can make some serious waves.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.351
- Like last night, for example.
- Your dad made those waves?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.313
Yeah.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.875
He's mad at me because
I swam away from home...

19:10.080 --> 19:13.311
...three days before I'm supposed
to get married off to this merman...

19:13.520 --> 19:15.636
...who's about as deep as a tidal pool.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.273
- Hey.
- Leonard. We have to go.

19:17.480 --> 19:18.993
He's a psycho. You have to hide.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.270
- Where are you going?
- We'll be back tomorrow.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.913
- Promise?
- Promise.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.758
- Someone over there?
- Come on.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.359
Don't get seen.

20:06.440 --> 20:09.318
Hailey. Hailey, wake up.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.355
What in the world?

20:22.560 --> 20:24.198
Oh, no.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.030
- This is bad. This is so bad.
- Come on.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.313
What have you done?

20:37.120 --> 20:40.271
- I drained the pool.
- She's not in there.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.755
- But how could she get out?
- I don't know.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.078
Come on.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.472
Oh, is you.
You scared the salt out of me.

21:00.680 --> 21:04.036
I thought you were that man
with that awful sucking machine.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.995
- I just about got turned inside out.
- How did you get in here?

21:08.200 --> 21:09.758
I used these.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.518
My very own pair.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.753
Oh, and check this out.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.710
- Wow.
- Isn't it cute?

21:28.520 --> 21:31.398
- Very cute.
- And I can sit on it.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.628
Hey, we gotta get you out.
Come on. You'll be seen.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.396
- Give her your t-shirt.
- No. My bathing suis like boy-repellent.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.909
- What if we see Raymond?
- Is your bathing suit...

21:41.120 --> 21:42.951
...or her birthday suit.
Come on.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.472
Stop.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.592
Oh, no. Thas not what you do.
You have to...

22:03.800 --> 22:06.109
- Put your arms there.
- Put your arms through them.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.595
- That looks amazing.
- I know.

22:23.560 --> 22:27.553
I don't understand how you can sleep
on these when they're so jumpy.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.478
I could just do this all day.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.477
Claire, what on earth
are you doing?

22:34.760 --> 22:38.435
You really need to stop.
Gram is gonna be really mad at us.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.398
We're gonna get in huge trouble.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.989
- You worry too much.
- I rest my case.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.958
This is so much fun.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.071
I love legs.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.999
So, do you get to keep them?

22:52.480 --> 22:54.391
We can only have legs
when the sun's out.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.433
We have to keep them dry.
Or at least thas what I've heard.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.397
I've never had the guts
to try them.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.511
So this is your first time ashore?

23:01.720 --> 23:04.188
First time on land.
First time with legs.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.834
- Can you believe it?
- You'd never know.

23:07.320 --> 23:11.359
But I got to be careful.
Add moonlight or water, instant tail.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.357
Look what I can do.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.273
Stop that.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.870
Crabs. They found me.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.559
With a shell?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.312
You can hear
the ocean through these.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.999
Yeah, but...

23:31.200 --> 23:33.316
Well, it works both ways.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.192
The ocean can hear you too.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.674
Hello? Dad?

23:38.880 --> 23:40.996
Aquamarine,
what do you think you're doing?

23:41.200 --> 23:43.555
- Daddy...
- Shell phone.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.199
Could you give me a minute?

23:46.720 --> 23:48.073
Sure. Sorry.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.236
Well, thas your plan, not mine.

23:50.440 --> 23:54.911
I don't want to marry
some spoiled, rich squid.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.635
Well, you can make all the storms
you want, but I'm not coming back.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.837
No, love is not a myth, Daddy.
Is real.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.192
- You think her dad is doing this?
- In three days, I'll prove it.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.994
If I'm wrong,
then I will honor your plans.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.034
And I'll call you every night, okay,
so calm down.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.033
I have to find love.

24:23.240 --> 24:27.791
We don't have it where I'm from.
If I can't find it in three days, I'm sunk.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.549
- You don't have love?
- No. My dad says is just a myth.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.239
We marry who our parents pick...

24:33.400 --> 24:36.790
...and my dad thinks I have bubbles
in my brain because I believe in love.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.390
The only way
I can get out of my wedding...

24:39.560 --> 24:41.949
...is if I can prove to him
that love exists.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.037
But that means
I only get three days.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.750
Or else I'll be swimming
down the aisle with...

24:47.720 --> 24:48.994
- that blowfish.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.628
But if you don't have love,
how do you know it exists?

24:51.840 --> 24:54.798
I saw it once. And I want it.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.992
With him.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.196
- Raymond?
- Check it out.

25:13.480 --> 25:14.799
Raymond?

25:15.240 --> 25:16.673
Raymond.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.355
Raymond is the one I love.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.471
No!

25:31.040 --> 25:33.270
No!

25:36.840 --> 25:39.957
Raymond. Raymond.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.673
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.553
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.674
Do you love me?

25:50.840 --> 25:54.913
No, but, I think you're hot.
Really hot.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.588
Come on, we gotta go.
The Beach House is going off.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.079
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.629
Well, I'll see you later.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.910
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

26:04.120 --> 26:08.159
- Come on.
- Hey, drop me off at home, can you?

26:12.840 --> 26:14.558
He doesn't love me?

26:14.760 --> 26:18.389
How can he not love me?
I need some salt.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.909
- What did you say?
- He said I was hot.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.190
But, how would he know?

26:23.400 --> 26:24.992
Do I feel hot to you?

26:26.200 --> 26:28.156
No, what he meant
is not how you took it.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.351
Help me get him
to fall in love with me.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.279
- Yeah, right.
- No, no, no. Raymonďs way too popular.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.273
- You should pick someone else.
- All the girls are after him.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.919
- Even a few boys.
- Right.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.759
Fine.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.751
Then you don't get your wish.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.359
- What?
- Wish? Wait, wait.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.829
- What?
- What wish?

26:46.040 --> 26:48.998
Oh, you know.
If you help a mermaid, you get a wish.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.997
Any wish you could wish for.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.633
I thought that was genies.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.073
You believe in genies?

26:58.640 --> 27:02.519
What if our wish
involves other people?

27:02.720 --> 27:04.312
Like my mom.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.631
Is a wish. Any wish.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.832
As long as it doesn't violate
the laws of nature.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.239
We'll help you.
We'll help you.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.396
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes. Yes.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.671
Just to let you know...

27:18.880 --> 27:21.155
...this is a humongous sacrifice for us.
- Yeah.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.759
Giving up Raymond?

27:22.960 --> 27:24.518
So you know him pretty well?

27:24.720 --> 27:27.154
Oh, yeah. We're experts on Raymond.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.596
- Yeah, we know him really well.
- We're like Rayologists.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.394
Good. But he has to say he loves me.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.318
Because I need proof for my dad.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.636
Otherwise you don't get your wish.
Deal?

27:39.200 --> 27:40.713
Deal.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.118
Deal.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.876
My name's Aquamarine.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.516
Now, les go find Raymond.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.835
- You need shoes.
- Yeah, and undies.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.039
Just stick with the pros.
Boys are what we live for.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.310
Creepy, right?
My mom collects this stuff.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.839
What does your mom do?

28:32.040 --> 28:34.235
Besides ruin my life?
She's a marine biologist.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.715
- Yeah, she's all scientific.
- More like horrific.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.310
She's dragged me
over the country for her job.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.272
She's been working
to clean up the bay.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.873
Well, tell her thanks for me...

28:43.080 --> 28:45.799
...because it tastes 10 times
better than it did years ago.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.513
Really?

28:49.280 --> 28:50.679
Okay, first things first.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.595
Aqua, what are you doing?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.358
He doesn't like this harsh light.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.950
Moby. He came out of hiding.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.476
Can you make boobs
come out of hiding?

29:08.640 --> 29:10.596
We begin where a girl starts a first crush.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.753
We call him.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.674
Call him? What?

29:14.880 --> 29:17.110
No, I can't.
What am I supposed to say to him?

29:17.320 --> 29:20.437
Nothing. We just call and hang up.
We do it all the time.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.793
- Why?
- I don't know. Is just what you do.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.158
Okay.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.839
Wait a minute.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.392
Is ringing.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.959
Hello?

29:42.080 --> 29:44.071
That was fantastic.
Les do it again.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.755
Okay.
The next step here is the ride-by.

29:49.960 --> 29:53.669
- Very important in any crush.
- Now remember, you have to act casual.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.673
Yes, like you didn't even remember
this was his street.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.950
Thas it. Thas Raymonďs house.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.196
Oh, that hurts.
But this will be worth it.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.796
There he is.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.918
What the...?

30:35.920 --> 30:37.876
Aqua, no, thas the brake.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.997
- Aqua, are you okay?
- I saw him. Did you see him?

30:59.200 --> 31:01.668
- He waved at me.
- Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?

31:01.880 --> 31:04.952
- Hi, Raymond.
- Oh, my God.

31:06.040 --> 31:08.395
We didn't even remember
this was your street.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.510
All right,
les see what you've got here.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.514
Nothing too serious.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.550
- We'll run it under some cold water...
- No. No.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.995
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
I wouldn't hurt you.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.874
All right, let me at least
put a Band-Aid on it.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.712
Lifeguarďs always prepared, right?

31:30.640 --> 31:32.471
Here we go.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.394
This won't hurt a bit.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.115
There you go. Voilá!

31:40.480 --> 31:41.799
Thank you.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.357
Is beautiful.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.553
So, what was your name?

31:52.400 --> 31:53.674
Aquamarine.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.354
Cool name. Will I see you
at the Street Fair today?

31:58.120 --> 32:01.271
- I love this song.
- Oh, no.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.394
- Who ordered broom service?
- Hi, Raymond.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.590
I'm here for my driving lesson.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.958
Les get you up.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.238
You going to be all right?

32:14.440 --> 32:18.319
Okay, cool. Hang on one sec.
I got to grab my keys.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.880
So, I'll see you later?

32:22.880 --> 32:25.189
Rock. Check it. Watch out.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.271
- Who is she?
- Cecilia.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.476
Thinks she's the shiz,
because her dad does weather.

32:30.640 --> 32:34.315
- Her dad can make weather?
- No. He just reports it.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.839
Shut up. I know how to drive.

32:37.240 --> 32:40.915
- And she's a princess?
- No, no, no, just a royal bitch.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.752
Then why are you so intimidated?

32:43.400 --> 32:44.958
Got it. Sorry.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.878
Hey, guys, does she have something
against girls' clothes?

32:58.400 --> 32:59.992
Nice hair.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.077
- Who are you?
- Aquamarine.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.397
- She's my cousin.
- Well, thas kind of pretty.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.556
For a crayon.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.197
I was named Aquamarine
after a rare and precious gemstone.

33:11.400 --> 33:16.554
Whereas Cecilia translated means
dim-sighted.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.394
But your parents know you
better than I do.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.399
What did you just say to me?

33:22.200 --> 33:25.033
Yep, definitely dim-sighted.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.390
There's something very fishy
about that girl.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.318
Cecilia Banks blew a gasket.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.270
Who cares about her.
What about Ray? I mean...

33:44.240 --> 33:46.117
...what happened to me back there?

33:46.320 --> 33:49.869
- I was such a clam. I couldn't think.
- Don't worry.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.913
Everything we've learned about boys
has come from the pages...

33:53.200 --> 33:55.794
...of these magazines. Come on.

33:56.120 --> 34:01.035
I can't stop thinking about him.
I feel so weird and tingly.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.951
- What?
- Look at my finger scales.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.828
Oh, wow.

34:07.120 --> 34:10.351
They've never been this color before.
They change color with my mood.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.154
- Whoa, weird.
- But I don't know what mood this is.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.114
- Love.
- Love.

34:16.440 --> 34:20.034
Okay. Start reading. We have a lot
to cover before we go to the Street Fair.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.677
Oh, I don't like this.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.594
Come on.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.991
- I need some salt.
- More like this.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.277
Number 28.
Come on.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.788
Come on, focus. Focus.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.194
How do you
remember all this?

35:04.400 --> 35:07.597
- You have to be flirty but demure.
- Yeah.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.872
Devoted, but not desperate.
Available but elusive.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.039
And if he calls Wednesday
for Saturday, you have to be busy.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.037
Even though you're free.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.878
Is so annoying.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.956
Yet strangely addictive.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.118
- No. No.
- I think she's on a boy-data overload.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.754
Les take her out.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.312
Roll up. Roll up.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.318
- Ain't got a chance.
- Is right here.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.238
There he is.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.272
- Ray. Ray, hi.
- Calm down.

35:37.480 --> 35:40.916
Haven't you learned anything?
Let him see you first.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.714
- Sorry. I just got so excited, I forgot.
- Is okay.

35:43.920 --> 35:48.710
Hey, how about if we do what...?
What "Liz D. From Skokie" suggests?

35:48.920 --> 35:53.550
"The laugh and pass."
Casually walk past him laughing.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.318
Good idea.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.796
You're so funny.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.478
Okay, look at him.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.118
Look away.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.319
Look at him, play with your hair.
Just kind of twirl it.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.277
Yeah, I saw that.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.552
- Arch your back. Arch your back.
- Pucker your lips, flip your hair.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.990
- Flip it. Yeah, flip it.
- Put your back out.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.794
Don't look at him.
No, no. He's looking at you.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.674
- Okay. "Fluff and Retreat."
- What?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.598
Come on, you can do it.
Come on, Ray.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.870
Fluff his ego, and retreat. Go.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.997
Yeah!

36:33.800 --> 36:35.518
Wow, Raymond, you're good.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.314
- Bye.
- Wha...? Wha...?

36:38.520 --> 36:40.829
- You didn't fluff enough.
- Here you go, man.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.671
- Hey, where are you going?
- Guess she did.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.552
- Come on.
- Guys, I'll catch up.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.830
- I'll hang out with Aqua.
- He gave a nickname.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.356
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.988
Are you having a good time?

36:56.280 --> 36:58.635
Yes, following you around is fun.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.833
Okay.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.673
- This guy's for you.
- Thanks.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.314
- Cotton candy. Get your cotton candy.
- You're welcome.

37:12.200 --> 37:16.113
Hurry, hurry. On the fairground
foreground you and the family...

37:16.360 --> 37:18.396
...and the weird Tattoo Lady.
- You want one?

37:18.600 --> 37:20.511
Yeah.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.551
Just one, please. Thanks.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.354
I just love eating cotton candy.
I mean...

37:37.560 --> 37:39.676
...I love eating it. Right, Hail?

37:39.880 --> 37:41.950
Is great.
It is so much fun to eat it.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.436
It just vanished.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.837
Shake...

38:03.480 --> 38:05.311
...stretch...

38:08.800 --> 38:11.439
...flex.
He likes her!

38:13.680 --> 38:16.478
- Roll up, roll up.
- Hey, what are those, water bikes?

38:17.960 --> 38:20.155
What? You've never been
on a paddleboat before?

38:20.360 --> 38:21.918
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Come on...

38:22.120 --> 38:24.429
...l'll give you your first ride.
- Sure.

38:24.640 --> 38:28.349
- Do you think she'll be okay out there?
- She's with Ray, isn't she?

38:28.560 --> 38:31.358
- Popcorn. Get your popcorn.
- I guess. Come on.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.277
So, how long are you in town?

38:42.480 --> 38:45.552
Two more days.
Then my daďs making me come home.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.196
If he doesn't get his way,
is always a huge disaster.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.753
Pretty controlling, huh?

38:51.600 --> 38:54.239
- You have no idea.
- Yeah, I do.

38:54.440 --> 38:57.591
My dad, he's all dead set
on me starting college next week...

38:57.800 --> 39:00.792
...but, I don't know, I wanna
take a year off and travel.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.515
I've never been out of Florida, so
we've been arguing about it all summer.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.675
And, he'll probably win the argument.
He always does.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.599
They just don't get it.
Sometimes, you have to leave home...

39:11.800 --> 39:14.234
...to figure out what you want.
- Exactly.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.869
You know, you're not like
most girls around here.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.678
They're so cute together.

39:25.880 --> 39:28.235
Claire, how romantic is that?

39:29.040 --> 39:30.678
This is nice.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.556
- The sun is setting.
- Yeah, I know.

39:34.760 --> 39:37.035
- We timed it well, didn't we?
- I have to get back.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.997
What? Okay.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.872
- All right. Okay. All right.
- Oh, no.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.634
We're going the wrong way.
We're heading back out to sea.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.633
Here we go, we're turning around.
Everything's okay.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.478
- Hailey.
- Claire.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.999
- Sunset.
- Oh, no.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.156
- She's gonna pop a tail.
- Hailey. Claire.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.715
Just add moonlight or water.

39:57.920 --> 40:00.229
- I have to get back.
- Hey. Hey.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.273
Here, les talk about something
to distract you, okay?

40:03.480 --> 40:06.438
Like, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

40:06.640 --> 40:09.518
- Probably heard about the Last Splash?
- We're coming Aqua.

40:09.720 --> 40:13.269
- Is a party. You're really in a hurry.
- Come on. Hurry up. Pedal.

40:13.480 --> 40:16.074
Is not your fault.
I have to be somewhere.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.515
You gotta help our friend.
She's sick. She's got...

40:20.680 --> 40:21.954
- Hydrophobia.
- Hypertension.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.394
Yeah.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.116
- Yeah.
- Come on. Hurry, please.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.673
This is serious.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.359
Go faster.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.993
- Hey.
- Oh, no.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.873
- Okay.
- You're almost there.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.838
- Come on. You're almost there.
- Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.353
- Careful.
- Hey.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.357
Les go. Keep going.
Don't stop.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.959
Bikes are around the corner.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.355
- Run.
- Sorry.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.234
- Go.
- I had so much fun.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.914
Go. Aqua, go, go.
We gotta get you back.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.397
I'll be right back.

40:56.440 --> 40:57.714
Hey, Ray.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.398
That was too close.
I need some water to spend the night in.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.919
- The ocean?
- No ocean.

41:03.080 --> 41:06.197
My father would just manipulate
the currents and pull me back home.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.873
I know a place.

41:11.360 --> 41:13.669
Holy mackerel.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.791
Hey, come on.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.350
Come on les go.
Claire, you doing this?

41:24.120 --> 41:26.839
- Aren't you coming?
- I don't do water...

41:27.040 --> 41:28.598
...on the ground or in the air.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.630
Raymond was about to kiss you
with his actual lips.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.796
- Stupid sun.
- Did Ray say anything?

41:36.160 --> 41:38.799
- He asked if I heard of Last Splash.
- What?

41:39.000 --> 41:40.911
- Really?
- Exactly what did he say?

41:43.520 --> 41:45.158
- I can't remember.
- So was it:

41:45.320 --> 41:47.629
"Are you going?"
Or "Will you go with me?"

41:47.840 --> 41:49.478
- Is there a difference?
- Huge.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.477
- Major.
- Okay. Well...

41:51.680 --> 41:54.877
...it started with,
"What are you doing tomorrow night?"

41:55.080 --> 41:56.354
My God, thas all you need.

41:56.520 --> 41:57.794
He was gonna ask for a date.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.592
- He was?
- Absolutely.

41:59.800 --> 42:03.395
- Yes.
- Be careful, guys.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.999
- Thanks.
- Sure.

42:17.720 --> 42:20.792
- Why won't Claire come with us?
- She's not good around water.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.592
Is kind of a long story.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.593
I wish I could hide out here with you.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.876
- Is this gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.677
I almost forgot.

43:14.160 --> 43:15.752
Me too.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.158
- This is nice.
- Good.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.516
Are you gonna be okay in here?

43:21.720 --> 43:23.790
You gonna be okay out there?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.353
I'll see you tomorrow...

43:29.600 --> 43:32.319
...fish-butt.
- I heard that.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.276
I never realized
how big this room was.

43:36.480 --> 43:39.278
Without all my stuff in it.
I want this wish so bad, Claire.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.148
Claire?

43:46.840 --> 43:50.913
Do you think he'll fall in actual love
with her in two days?

43:51.120 --> 43:54.669
He has to. Is our last hope.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.398
- Hailey.
- What?

44:01.600 --> 44:04.956
We completely forgot something.
Whas she gonna wear to Last Splash?

44:05.160 --> 44:08.277
I mean, she can't keep wearing
your t-shirts. No offense.

44:08.480 --> 44:12.189
Okay, think. We'll take the first bus into
Tampa tomorrow and we'll go shopping.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.709
- Wha...? No. We can't.
- We have to.

44:15.040 --> 44:18.874
Besides, I have $400 saved up
from working at the aquarium.

44:19.120 --> 44:22.510
- Do you know what trouble we'll be in?
- Come on, Clairedy Cat.

44:25.680 --> 44:29.559
- Sorry about that.
- I don't know, Hailey.

44:34.920 --> 44:36.353
Smile.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.875
Hello.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.151
What? Why go through life unnoticed?

45:01.200 --> 45:03.634
- This store is hideous.
- This store is for old people.

45:04.720 --> 45:07.234
- Yeah.
- No. No.

45:07.600 --> 45:09.909
- This store is kind of lame.
- Is all used stuff.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.510
Come on you guys. Is so different
from anything else we saw at the mall.

45:13.680 --> 45:15.352
Come on.
Just give it a chance.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.752
Hey, you guys.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.350
- Is old-fashioned, but it works.
- I don't know.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.869
I love vintage.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.990
Look at these sleeves.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.558
Sorry.

46:14.320 --> 46:18.233
Okay, we've got three hours
till Last Splash, so quick review?

46:18.440 --> 46:19.714
- Dresses?
- Check.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.836
- Blue highlights?
- Big check.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.600
- Are we missing anything?
- Wait.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.199
I don't have earrings.

46:26.400 --> 46:30.234
- How could I not have earrings?
- I have earrings. Don't worry.

46:33.880 --> 46:37.395
Pretty, and pointy?

46:38.240 --> 46:40.435
What am I supposed to do with this?

46:40.640 --> 46:43.074
Like, stick it through my skin?

46:43.280 --> 46:46.909
- Thas what you do.
- You're so primitive.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.076
- I wear stick-ons.
- You mean clip-ons?

46:49.400 --> 46:50.719
No.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.994
You'll love these.
They're my favorite aquatic accessory.

46:55.320 --> 46:56.912
You see that buoy out there?

46:57.120 --> 47:00.351
I need you to swim out there
and find me a couple of starfish about...

47:02.000 --> 47:03.672
...this big?
- Live starfish.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.791
Thas what you wear for earrings?

47:06.000 --> 47:07.274
They compliment me.

47:07.480 --> 47:10.233
Aqua, I've got earrings
thall complement you just fine.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.193
No, I mean, they literally
give me compliments.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.753
In my ear.
They talk to me.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.758
Starfish are notorious suck-ups.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.837
They love to give compliments.

47:20.040 --> 47:22.554
But is nice
when you need a little boost.

47:22.760 --> 47:24.637
Okay, you guys. Les go.

47:24.840 --> 47:28.116
Hailey, I can't. You've got to do this.

47:28.320 --> 47:30.629
Do you see how far that buoy is?
No.

47:30.840 --> 47:33.274
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you a ride.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.428
No way.

47:53.400 --> 47:56.039
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, my goodness.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.276
Hi, guys.

47:59.160 --> 48:02.152
Watch the legs, guys.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.194
- Claire, look at that.
- Hi.

48:04.480 --> 48:08.075
Oh, my goodness.
Claire, you have to do this with me.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.758
You go.

48:13.960 --> 48:15.473
Have fun.

48:16.040 --> 48:17.951
Okay. All right.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.112
Are you sure?

48:25.360 --> 48:26.793
Yeah.

48:42.640 --> 48:44.835
Claire, look at me.

48:46.400 --> 48:48.709
Way to go, Hails.

48:57.440 --> 48:59.954
- Hailey.
- Hi, guys!

49:04.760 --> 49:08.150
Don't you just love love?

49:09.840 --> 49:11.193
What?

49:11.720 --> 49:13.278
Is just...

49:13.720 --> 49:15.358
...you're so sure of yourself.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.711
Well, I've only seen love
up close once...

49:17.880 --> 49:20.872
...but, if you'd seen it the way I did,
you'd feel the same way.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.638
Why?

49:22.960 --> 49:25.394
- What was it like?
- It was years ago.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.068
Not too far from here, actually.

49:28.400 --> 49:32.439
We were migrating through the bay just
like we always do this time of year...

49:33.400 --> 49:36.551
...and I saw this couple out sailing
on their little blue boat.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.669
And the way
they looked at each other...

49:40.240 --> 49:44.074
...it was a look I'd never seen
anywhere else in the seven seas.

49:44.720 --> 49:47.917
I've wanted someone
to look at me that way ever since.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.155
I looked for them every year,
but I never saw them again.

49:52.480 --> 49:57.429
- Was there a name on the boat?
- I don't remember, Claire.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.634
Oh, the Claire ďLune.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.472
Those were my parents.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.315
Claire, they really loved each other.

50:14.120 --> 50:16.953
I don't think they would have
wanted you to be afraid of life.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.873
I think they would have wanted you
to be friends with it.

50:23.160 --> 50:25.879
- Yeah.
- Hey, I found some.

50:26.080 --> 50:29.311
- A matching set.
- Hailey.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.950
It was the most incredible thing ever.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.878
Something I wish I had
done with you.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.519
- Aqua. Aqua.
- There you go.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.950
- Oh, Aqua.
- And one for you.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.434
Thank you.

50:46.600 --> 50:51.037
- Aquamarine is so lovely.
- Oh, stop.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.071
She makes us so lovely...

50:53.280 --> 50:57.239
...just being near such loveliness.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.158
And she's smart.

50:59.320 --> 51:03.199
- Smart, yes, like tuna.
- Like tuna.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.472
We love being near Aqua.

51:06.680 --> 51:08.636
Aqua-Aqua.

51:09.960 --> 51:13.350
- Look who it is.
- Wow. The blue hair is spreading.

51:13.680 --> 51:15.875
You guys look like
the Grandma Brigade.

51:16.680 --> 51:19.433
Whas next, dentures or Depends?

51:19.640 --> 51:22.598
Whas next is I'm going with Raymond
to the Last Splash.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.474
I've got some advice.

51:24.760 --> 51:27.513
You need to separate fantasy
from reality.

51:27.720 --> 51:29.950
Ray's going to the Last Splash
with Cecilia.

51:30.160 --> 51:32.674
- She asked him at the Street Fair.
- What?

51:33.840 --> 51:37.276
Love to stay and chat, but
we're late for Cecilia's pre-party.

51:37.480 --> 51:40.199
I've got some advice for you too.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.199
Put on a dry shirt.

51:51.800 --> 51:54.314
- That was totally amazing.
- That was great.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.759
Is Ray.

51:58.480 --> 52:02.439
I can't believe I was so stupid.
Why would he choose her over me?

52:02.760 --> 52:05.752
You're supposed to know him.
He obviously doesn't like me at all.

52:05.960 --> 52:09.396
- Thas not possible.
- I never shoulďve trusted you.

52:09.600 --> 52:12.990
- He's into you. This doesn't make sense.
- Bull shark.

52:13.200 --> 52:16.272
- Forget it. I'm going home.
- Aqua, no.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.198
- Wait.
- Claire.

52:18.400 --> 52:22.359
This is totally, completely,
eternally over.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.398
I'm moving.

52:25.160 --> 52:26.912
I'm going to be the new girl again.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.431
You know what. No.

52:32.920 --> 52:34.239
No, we're gonna split up.

52:34.440 --> 52:36.476
You're gonna go stop Aqua, and...

52:36.680 --> 52:38.557
...and I'm gonna go find Raymond.
Okay?

52:38.760 --> 52:40.955
Meet me back at the club
as soon as possible.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.276
Hurry. Go.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.916
Aqua, don't do it.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.313
Don't do it.

53:09.800 --> 53:12.872
- Aqua, you can't do this.
- Why not?

53:13.080 --> 53:16.629
I'm never going to see him again.
You know what? He doesn't care.

53:17.200 --> 53:19.475
I'm just gonna go home.
This was all for nothing.

53:19.640 --> 53:21.471
It was not for nothing.
It was for love.

53:21.680 --> 53:23.352
You know what I think of love?

53:23.560 --> 53:24.913
Love stinks.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.917
No wonder we don't have it
back home.

53:28.480 --> 53:31.313
- Please don't give up yet.
- Why? Because of your wish?

53:32.680 --> 53:34.750
Let me tell you something.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.755
My dad said he loved me.

53:37.960 --> 53:40.269
He said he loved my mother
and then he left us.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.755
He left us for some other woman...

53:43.520 --> 53:46.637
...but I guess thas the way it is,
and love doesn't always work.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.195
I don't understand.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.394
Thas life.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.478
Thas how it is here.
But, when you find love...

53:55.680 --> 53:58.717
...I guess is really beautiful.
Thas what I've read.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.195
And I don't know as much
about it as I say I do...

54:01.400 --> 54:04.119
...but I know that there's a reason
why everybody wants it.

54:04.280 --> 54:05.554
And whas that?

54:09.000 --> 54:11.070
Is the closest thing
we have to magic.

54:14.440 --> 54:16.396
Don't give up yet.

54:20.760 --> 54:24.196
Oh, my God,
whas happening to me?

54:25.400 --> 54:26.879
I'm leaking.

54:28.160 --> 54:31.072
- Aqua, you're crying.
- I'm leaking salt water.

54:31.280 --> 54:32.713
I'm falling apart.

54:33.120 --> 54:36.237
No, they're tears. Your body
makes them when you cry.

54:36.520 --> 54:39.512
I guess you wouldn't have them,
living underwater.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.829
This is crazy.
Next you're going to tell me...

54:43.040 --> 54:45.349
...water shoots out of your nose
when you're happy.

54:47.240 --> 54:49.117
Only occasionally.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.914
Nice bike.

55:00.120 --> 55:02.873
Time for a swim.

55:06.640 --> 55:08.278
Excuse me.

55:16.760 --> 55:20.230
- How could you do this to Aqua?
- Do what?

55:20.440 --> 55:23.830
Take Cecilia to the Last Splash
after you already asked Aquamarine?

55:24.040 --> 55:28.113
Yeah, well, that was before
I found out that she has a boyfriend.

55:28.480 --> 55:29.913
- A boyfriend?
- Yeah.

55:30.120 --> 55:33.715
The one she practically jumped
overboard for to watch the sunset.

55:33.920 --> 55:36.673
Aqua doesn't have a boyfriend.
Who told you that?

55:39.280 --> 55:43.068
Vince. Vince.
The little girl wants to go in.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.915
- I want to go in where?
- Into the pool.

55:46.120 --> 55:48.111
No, put me down.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.436
- Vince, don't, man. Don't. Stop.
- Put me down.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.198
- Put me down!
- Man, put her down.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.470
Okay, okay.

55:55.240 --> 55:57.390
Jeez, relax. Whas the big drama?

55:58.800 --> 56:00.074
Whatever.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.435
God, take a joke.

56:11.680 --> 56:14.638
Take a joke? Whas the matter
with you? She's scared.

56:15.200 --> 56:17.111
She was trying to get attention.
Hello.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.276
No, thas your job,
isn't it, Cecilia?

56:22.120 --> 56:24.270
Raymond, I was kidding.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.272
Joke. Hello.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.998
Claire. Claire, hold on.

56:33.040 --> 56:34.678
You okay?

56:35.320 --> 56:38.835
Look, you know where I can find Aqua?
I really need to talk to her.

56:41.040 --> 56:44.510
Yeah? Is that a nod?
I know I see a nod.

56:45.760 --> 56:48.479
This next one's
for the brokenhearted out there.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.393
Who needs Raymond?

57:00.600 --> 57:03.558
I found two new men to love
and their names are Ben and Jerry.

57:13.800 --> 57:17.998
Raymond. Who needs Raymond?
I need some salt.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.676
I don't know what Cecilia
was talking about.

57:23.280 --> 57:26.397
I think they're in here.
In my room.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.272
Oh, gosh.

57:31.480 --> 57:34.631
- Hey.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

57:34.840 --> 57:36.512
How's it going?

57:37.360 --> 57:39.476
Bad. No, good. Fine.

57:39.680 --> 57:42.069
Just wait on the balcony,
and we'll be out in a sec.

57:44.840 --> 57:46.193
What are you doing?

57:50.320 --> 57:52.038
What was he doing here?

57:52.240 --> 57:53.992
Cecilia told him Aqua had a boyfriend.

57:55.480 --> 57:57.391
That... That barnacle.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.158
But Raymond wants to talk to you.

57:59.480 --> 58:03.268
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

58:18.600 --> 58:20.511
- You know what?
- Then the fish attacked me.

58:20.720 --> 58:21.994
- It attacked you?
- Yeah.

58:22.200 --> 58:24.031
- Kind of like a penguin.
- Later, guys.

58:24.240 --> 58:26.515
- Oh, hey.
- Thanks for coming.

58:39.640 --> 58:41.676
Guess who's got a date
to the Last Splash?

58:43.320 --> 58:44.594
Me.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.998
Gently catch it. You break
your balloon, you're out.

59:10.200 --> 59:12.316
Okay, now toss it again.

59:12.520 --> 59:15.637
The idea is to keep
stepping back as you go.

59:15.840 --> 59:18.718
Come on, people, you
could win a date with me.

59:19.720 --> 59:22.154
Good throw, man.
You ready for the heater?

59:23.960 --> 59:26.554
Oh, watch out. Be careful.
Heavy-handed.

59:26.760 --> 59:29.593
We go under, not over.

59:30.480 --> 59:31.879
Okay, take a step back.

59:44.680 --> 59:45.908
Ray, you're out.

59:46.120 --> 59:47.348
Come on, off you go.

59:51.440 --> 59:53.431
I think I feel seasick...

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.430
...but in a good way.
- Just be yourself.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.874
Minus the tail.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.714
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.239
- Wow, you look pretty.
- So do you.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.633
Thank you.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.276
- What about we grab something to eat?
- Yes, I'm good at that.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.598
Okay.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.113
Here they come.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.677
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.194
- Come on.
- What can I get you?

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.079
- I think I see where they went.
- Where?

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.114
There they are!

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.075
- Is that good?
- Yes. Is very calming.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.637
Okay. I'll try some.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.119
- No.
- Thas good.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.271
To new things.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.793
Oh, sorry.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.998
Guess thas
an acquired taste, huh?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.672
They're having a genius time.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.591
- You look really pretty, honey.
- Thanks.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.309
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.631
I see you and Claire
have made a new friend.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.638
Yeah, how about that? Another
person I get to say goodbye to.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.519
Ginny. Oh, Ginny.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.597
I just read about you in the Tribune.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.920
You didn't tell me you were one of,
what, 200 applicants. What an honor.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.429
I've been trying to land a grant
for 10 years.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.471
I just hope we can do
some good with it.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.352
Only the fish will know for sure.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.278
Aren't you happy for your mom?

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.952
Ecstatic.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.833
Come on.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.116
Don't worry, honey.
You know how kids are.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.309
So, if you could travel anywhere
in the world, where would you go?

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.512
Thas easy. I would go to Fiji.
I hear is amazing.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.553
- It is. Is unbelievable.
- You've been there?

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.836
Well, I've been to lots of places.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.510
But I've learned is not
where you are, is who you're with.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.072
- You always so sure of everything?
- Yes.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.428
- More people should be like that.
- Well, some of us are only human.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.992
Thank you.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.435
Hey, how you doing?
Wow, thanks.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.710
Can you play Weezer's
"Island in the Sun"?

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.399
Please?

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.800
Yeah, sure, we can do that.
I love that song.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.190
Hi, everyone. We'd like to start
things off with a special request.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.952
I love this song.
You want to dance?

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.280
I want to, but I don't know how.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.311
What? Is easy. I'll show you.
Come on.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.795
Come on.
You can't be worse than me.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.073
I told you I was bad.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.397
No, you're great, you're great.
Thas okay.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.716
Here. You ever spend any time
in the water?

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.559
Some. You know.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.196
Right. Okay.
So, you just got to kind of...

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.198
...let the music carry you.
You know, just like a wave would.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.838
Wavy, yeah.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.670
There you go.
Yeah. There you go. Nice.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.478
I'll be right back.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.036
Back off. Don't make a bigger fool
of yourself than you already have.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.517
Walk away.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.479
Bye.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.798
Good job.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.033
- He's so into her.
- He likes her.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.028
Thank you, Capri Beach Club.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.150
Sunset. Come on.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.714
Dancing with you is...

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.639
...better than anything
I've ever done on feet.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.111
Say goodbye.
Is time to go.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.476
- I have to go.
- What? Again?

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.114
Come on, at least stay for the fireworks.
Come on!

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.515
There's going to be fireworks?

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.794
I can't. I wish I could.
I really do.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.873
But you leave tomorrow.
I want to spend more time with you.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.879
What can I say to make you stay?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.911
You can tell me...

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.712
- What? Tell you what?
- Aqua, we have to go right now!

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.598
Tomorrow. Tomorrow you can tell me.
Come to the pier at 9:00.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.552
And tell you what?

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.350
- You tell me how that makes you feel.
- Come on!

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.070
I can't believe that I'm not that...
What?

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.631
Come on, Hails.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:34.908
Okay, you little freaks.
What are you doing here?

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.318
Cecilia, I want to go back to the party.
They're handing out sparklers.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.599
She lives in a water tower.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.950
Freak city.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.117
This is so lame.

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.231
And who cares?

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.835
I'm tired of sitting here staring at it.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.917
Yeah, Cecilia.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.079
We already missed the fireworks
and now we're missing the party.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.308
Patty, could you put away
the negativity...

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.119
...like you put away all the corn dogs
at the Street Fair?

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.192
I'm going up.
If anyone comes, honk.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.439
But, I only had two.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.116
Who needs this?

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.154
Here we go.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.750
What are you up to?

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.998
Hailey?

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.272
Is someone there?

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.750
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.073
Wait! Cecilia.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.469
Okay, okay.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.069
Nice and slow.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.190
She's a... She's a...

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.149
She's a... She's a... She's a...

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.549
You want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.477
I need to see your hand stamp.
Thank you.

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.238
Night!

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.189
- Can I see your hand stamp, please?
- This is my hand stamp.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.957
- You know who I am.
- I'm sorry, Cecilia.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.991
Has grilling burgers fried your brain...

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.118
...or do you grill all day
because you have no brain? Excuse me.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.629
- Girls. Girls, girls, girls.
- Cecilia.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.433
Aquamarine. She's a mermaid.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.437
She has...
She has scales and everything.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.592
She has a big, fat tail!
Thas why she lives in the water tower.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.791
Whoa! You need to slow it way down.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.474
- What are you talking about?
- You sound a little crazy.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.558
No, no, no. I'm not crazy.
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.796
- You're freaking us out.
- There's no mermaid.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.436
Why are you looking at me when
there's a mermaid in a water tower?

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.710
There's no mermaid.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.992
Oh, okay, fine. And by the way,
why did you leave me there, huh?

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.109
Do you have any idea
how far I had to walk?

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.074
- She's crazy.
- Why is that funny?

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.918
A mermaid.
A big, fat mermaid.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.758
I was quoted for 40 boxes, wasn't I?

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.474
- No, is 55.
- Fifty-five?

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.515
- Bye, Mom.
- Hey. Be back soon, Hails.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.597
Daddy! Daddy!

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.677
Daddy, is so horrible.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.317
I went on my run this morning down by
the water tower and I heard this crying...

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.029
...and this poor girl,
I think she's trapped up there!

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.992
Did you call the police?

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.632
I wanted to tell you first.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.839
Come in.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.236
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.118
Will you take care of Moby?

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:35.033
You won't have to go tomorrow.
Believe me.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:41.152
So I was thinking we should meet
at the pier at around 8:45.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.753
Hail?

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.990
Are you listening to me?

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.515
Maybe we should think
about the wish.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.398
What do you mean?

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.511
We know
what we're doing with our wish.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.472
You're staying in Bay Bridge.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:05.356
Right. But I was thinking about it
all last night...

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.150
...my mom has worked all her life
for this. Maybe is not fair.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.956
We asked for a miracle, Hailey,
and we got it. We're using it.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.830
Maybe we could wish
for something else, maybe.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.515
Something else?
Like what? Like a new best friend?

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.589
- A new person to tell everything to?
- Claire, no. Stop it.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.392
How can you even think that way?

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.916
I'm saying, maybe we'll learn
to stand on our own for a change.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.634
- You mean me, don't you?
- I mean, I'm not your mom.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.349
Please. You act like I need
you all the time, when the truth is...

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.232
...you're so mad at the world...

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.238
...that nobody but me
even wants to talk to you.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:55.869
So you lived here your whole life. How
do you figure that I'm your only friend?

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.036
- WQDA, the coass
breaking news channel.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.674
A report just in that a young girl
is trapped in the Bay Bridge water tower.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.155
We'll be going live to Storm Banks,
the man on the scene.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.955
This is Storm Banks reporting live
from Bay Bridge water tower...

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.958
...where an unidentified girl
has been trapped.

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.435
Firefighters are racing against time
to rescue...

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.713
...this woman from a watery grave.
- Hailey, wait!

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.673
Hailey, wait! Hailey!

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.994
- How'd you come across this?
- I was on my morning run.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.119
All of a sudden, I heard this horrible
screaming. I didn't know what to do.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.235
I did the first thing that came to mind,
which was to inform the newscast.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.237
And we can only hope
that we find her.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.834
- The ladder's gone.
- Oh, no.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.350
I just did what any good citizen
would have done.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.949
We can only hope
that they'll pull her out in time...

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.032
...so she can be reunited
with her friends and loved ones.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.231
Hey. He's got something.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.839
Okay, guys. Showtime.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.597
Okay, you getting this?

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.196
We got a floater.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.558
No. Thas not possible.
No, she's up there.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.115
- Okay, sweetie.
- She's up there.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.314
They know whas going on.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.431
- They know whas going on.
- Yeah, I know.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.358
Tell them how she's up there.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.630
She's probably still hiding
under the water.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.398
- Go to commercial.
- Daddy.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.912
You know why?
Because she is a mermaid.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.716
- Go to commercial.
- Mermaid. Mermaid.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.070
- Go to commercial, now.
- Fins and everything.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.794
Are we out?
You've got to be kidding me.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.353
Give me your keys.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.952
- No, Dad. No.
- Cecilia.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.594
- No, no, no. No!
- Cecilia!

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.590
Give me your car keys. Now.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.871
While you're walking to school
every day...

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.759
...you can figure out
why you need so much attention.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:23.795
- Where could she be?
- I don't know. Les go.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.514
Thas a wrap... on my career.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.316
- But, Daddy, my car.
- Yeah, save it, Cecilia.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.269
You know why?
Because she is a mermaid.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.754
Go to commercial.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.275
There's not usually a man with a ladder
around when you need him.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.597
- I can't thank you enough.
- I guess I could say the same to you.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.990
You're the first one
who talked to me all summer.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.552
Well, at least nicely.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.192
I appreciate that.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.118
You're a long way from home,
aren't you?

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.517
Thank you.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.877
You know, when you help a mermaid,
you get a wish.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.836
Is almost 9:30 and she's not here.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.235
- Where could she be?
- Don't say is my fault.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.757
- There's Ray.
- I can see that, thanks.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.879
- What is your problem?
- I'm not giving up this wish, Hailey.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.313
She's here.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.834
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.878
L...

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.077
I thought about you all night.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.874
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.269
So? What was it that you...
wanted to tell me?

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.072
Or ask me? I wasn't sure if...

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.669
Okay. Here it goes.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.436
The last couple of days
have been amazing.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.154
Yeah, but wait.
Before we get to that...

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.156
...could you maybe give me
like a 20-minute warning...

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.272
...you know,
before the part where you run away?

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.917
Don't worry.
I don't have to leave yet.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.636
Cool. Because, I was thinking
maybe we could go kite surfing.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.912
Like, there's this really, really
awesome place right down the shore.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.076
The waves are small,
but the wave itself...

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.236
- Wait.
...breaks on the cove...

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.398
...it sprays up into the air and you can
always see a rainbow.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.438
- Is cool... If you're into that.
- We're losing them. She's gonna ask.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.636
- I'm into that kind of thing.
- I can't hear.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.232
Come on, les go up top.

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.590
- Thas if you want to do that.
- I want to.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.472
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.234
Cool. Because, afterwards,
I know this great little...

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.833
Actually is a total dive...

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.554
...but they have the best hot dogs ever,
I swear.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.994
- Raymond?
- Yeah?

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.637
- I have to ask you something.
- Right, right. Yeah. Okay. Shoot.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.679
I came here looking for something
I wasn't even sure existed.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.354
But...

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.231
...then I met you
and now I have to ask you.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.919
Ask me.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.031
- Try the binoculars.
- Don't yell at me.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.789
- Raymond?
- Yeah?

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.079
Do you love me?

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.358
Well.

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.997
I mean, we've had one date.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.518
- Whas going on?
- Don't get me wrong.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.319
Don't get me wrong.
I like you. I really, really like you.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:19.276
Wait, I think he's reaching out for her.
Thas a good sign. Look.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.438
I mean, I think you're smart,
and beautiful...

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.196
...and different than anyone
I've ever met...

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.396
...and I'd like to see a lot
more of you.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.919
But...

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.871
...you don't love me.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:36.276
- She's pulling away. Wait, no. Is she?
- Let me see whas going on.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.438
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.397
Are you crying?

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.234
Yes. Apparently, is something I do.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.032
I don't understand.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:50.277
Why do I have to be in love with you
today? Why can't we just...

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.754
...work our way there?

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.754
I have a better idea. Why doesn't she
just go back to where she came from?

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.593
- Oh, no!
- Aqua!

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.472
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.074
Oh, my God.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.911
Raymond! Raymond!

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.430
Just stay calm. Don't fight the current.
I'll be right there.

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.636
He still chooses her over me?

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.990
She's a fish!

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.552
Aqua. Aqua, we're coming!
Her daďs pulling her back.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.836
I'm going to get my rescue board.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.270
- We can't just let her go.
- I'm going in.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.078
No.

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.472
Not without me you're not.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.994
Hailey.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.270
Hailey.

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.352
- Come on.
- Hailey.

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.074
Grab the buoy.
We'll meet you there.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.391
I'm right here. I won't leave you.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.473
- Hailey, I can't.
- Keep your eye on the buoy.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.631
Don't stop.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.552
I'm coming.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.557
- Grab my hand.
- Hailey.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.159
You can do it.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.117
I can't believe you two.
Is not safe out here.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.596
- The storm's too strong.
- Why is your dad pulling you back now?

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.476
- He can't just take you away.
- Yes, he can. That was our deal.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.033
Take our wish.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.394
And you can stay here.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.552
I can't.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.031
Yeah, take it.
And you can call off your wedding.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.595
- But there's no wish.
- What?

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.240
Raymond doesn't love me.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.153
My father was right.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.920
I couldn't prove love exists.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.633
I'm so sorry.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.479
- Can't we do something?
- Yeah, anything.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.273
What more could you do for me?

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.431
You jumped in the water to save me.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.358
And now you'd give me your wish?

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.710
Why would you do that for me?

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.550
I don't know.
Is what I would do for her...

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.593
...and I know she'd do it for me,
and just...

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.917
...because we love you, Aqua.
- You do?

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:10.031
I didn't know you leak
when you're happy too.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.039
Look.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.233
Your daďs letting you go.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.034
- Because of you.
- What?

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.191
Don't you see?
You just proved to him that love exists.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.516
I guess you get a wish after all.
Any requests?

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.953
Can we wish for you
to stay here forever?

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.470
I'm a mermaid, Claire.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.513
I have a family out there
that needs me.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:05.037
As much as I want to stay,
I belong in the ocean.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.071
Most of the time.

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.833
Save your wish, okay?
I promise I'll come back to visit.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.350
And if I have to swim against
the Gulf Stream from here to Australia...

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.278
...l'll do it.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.475
I'd circle the world for you two.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.240
So I guess this is it, right?

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.590
Someone's got to go back
and return all those wedding gifts.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.156
We're going to miss you, Aqua.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.199
You can always call me on my shell.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.876
I want you guys to have these.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.279
Thanks.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.837
Starfish may be big suck-ups...

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.831
...but they never lie.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.239
- Aqua.
- I love you guys too.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.353
Aqua. Aqua.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.795
- Oh, my God! Keep in touch, fish-butt.
- We want a full report.

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.876
I'll see you soon.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.399
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.433
Bye.

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.238
- Race you to the pier.
- No, wait.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:57.470
Les just float a while.
I want to enjoy this.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.235
Has this been the best summer ever
or what?

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:03.238
Just wait till next summer,
when you visit me in Australia.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.396
If I can swing that
with my allowance.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.273
Claire...

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.634
...we still have our wish.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.434
Oh, my God.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.073
You know what, Hailey?

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.794
Is good to have friends with fins.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.918
Wait up.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:24.357
Wow, I can't... I can't...
I can't believe it.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.317
They didn't exactly cover this
in lifeguard training.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.156
I know. I should have told you.
I hope you're not... mad.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:39.117
No. No, I'm not mad.
Surprised, definitely.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.396
And confused
about a couple of things.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.991
Like for one,
the fact that you have a tail.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.150
Yeah. I do.

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.559
A very nice one, by the way.

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.032
I know.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:03.191
Are you planning to surface
anytime soon?

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.189
That sounds...
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.995
I'm not sure how to ask
a mermaid out.

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:12.719
But I'd like to see you again.

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.714
If thas allowed or even possible.

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:21.078
Well, I have to swim back for a bit.

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.475
Clear the water with my dad.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.031
Would you mind waiting a little while?

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.354
Maybe you could meet me
in Fiji sometime.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.870
- Leonard?
- Good day, ladies!

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.314
Hey, girls.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.359
- Thas really sweet.
- I'm really happy for them.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.879
Hailey. Claire.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.638
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:13.631
Look, I just had to tell you guys thanks.
You're both...

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.234
You're both extraordinary.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.991
Don't know if I coulďve
done what you did.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.598
See you.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.956
Oh, my God.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.713
Oh, my goodness.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.756
I'll see you soon?

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.630
I'm going to miss you so much.

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.278
I know. I'm going to miss you too.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:11.912
Hailey is so beautiful, inside and out.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.998
She's the best friend
you could ever have.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.270
Claire is so courageous.

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:22.679
Claire has a true heart.
She understands a true friend.

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.996
She will never let you down.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.794
She glows from the inside.
