I don't have time to think about meatballs,
meatloaf, meat fruit, or any other kind

07:54.141 --> 07:55.674
about meatballs, meatloaf, meat fruit, or any
other kind of meat until we find the other

07:55.676 --> 07:56.475
meat fruit, or any other kind of meat until
we find the other pink shoe that matches

07:56.477 --> 07:59.211
of meat until we find the other pink
shoe that matches this pink shoe!

07:59.213 --> 08:01.980

Now, I found the shoe yesterday,
in this bush at 4:18 P.M.,

08:38.085 --> 08:39.885
I found the shoe yesterday, in this bush
at 4:18 P.M., approximately 25 yards

08:39.887 --> 08:40.418
in this bush at 4:18 P.M.,
approximately 25 yards from the corner

08:40.420 --> 08:42.521

The area where the missing left shoe was found.
These wads of bubble gum

08:53.000 --> 08:54.299

gum represent all twelve trash cans

08:54.301 --> 08:55.100

all twelve trash cans in the area,

08:55.102 --> 08:56.301
represent all twelve trash cans
in the area, which I checked,

08:56.303 --> 08:57.102

which I checked, but the missing
right shoe wasn't in any of them.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.105
But the missing right shoe wasn't in any of them.
>> Why can't Sam just help you

09:00.107 --> 09:04.976
wasn't in any of them. >> Why can't Sam
just help you find the other pink shoe?

09:04.978 --> 09:10.181
'Cause Sam doesn't think Cat needs to
be wearing a pair of nasty pink shoes

09:10.183 --> 09:14.286

pink shoes she found in a street bush.
