Did Sabine have any

00:22.600 --> 00:24.600
Is Kevin in some sort of trouble?

00:24.600 --> 00:26.600
I know that Max Dalgety was in your group.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.000
Qui, so what is the group?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.500
Chinese students and others, 
committed to exposing human right's abuses.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.600
- What about Sabine Hobbs?
- Her protest was part of a plan.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.500

03:42.200 --> 03:44.200
- Well, regarding your inquiry. 
- Yeah?

03:44.200 --> 03:48.900
There's no record with the Dept. of Immigration
 of a Zheng Zhao having ever been in the country.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.200
Well, then he must be on a diplomatic passport.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.800
He's gotta face charges.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.000
Arresting him would require ministerial 
approval from the Attorney General.

And then China would have him flown back under
 diplomatic immunity and we'd lose him forever.

 let him out until you got an answer?

- I'll get right to the point, Senator.
- I'm aware of the point, Ambassador.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.100
Good. Than you won't mind if 
I try to urge you to reconsider.

20:51.100 --> 20:56.100
Because right here, right now, 
we need General McAuliffe on our team.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.600
Are you telling me how 
to run my Department, Brent?

21:00.200 --> 21:04.400
Merely some sounded 
advice between friends, Mal.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.800
That's the thing about this... Cerberus.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.600
It guarded the gates 
of hell, but it begs the question:

21:13.600 --> 21:15.700
which side of those gates are we on?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.900
Are we trying to get in
 or are we trying to get out?

21:21.400 --> 21:23.800
You're gonna have to excuse me, Senator.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.200

and the other dissents...

22:41.600 --> 22:43.600
Do you think that you 
could tell me where it is?

23:51.400 --> 23:55.600

anonymously report a crime.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.000
Yeah, I'm on. You got a pen?

24:13.500 --> 24:15.700
No hard feelings, I trust.

24:15.700 --> 24:19.000
Well, this is Canberra, Minister. 
Feelings don't really come into it.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.300
I hear you were shot at, on the lake.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.000
Which is part of the 
reason I wanted to see you.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
That man is Zheng Zhao.

24:32.500 --> 24:35.500
He is a Chinese Ministry
 of State security operative.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.500
And he is here, in Canberra.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.500
I believe that he killed an ASD analyst.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.300

Who the fuck does China think it is, trying 
to pull this strong-arm shit in our backyard?

May I keep this?

25:20.400 --> 25:21.900

25:21.900 --> 25:25.400
There's no official record of
 him ever entering the country.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.900
And you wonder why we need my legislation.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.200
There's something else
 that I wanted to ask you.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.900
One of the dissidents that Zheng abducted,

25:34.900 --> 25:36.600
Qui Kwan Sing,

25:36.600 --> 25:37.800
he needs asylum.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.800
Where is Qui now?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.800
Well, he is in hiding 
because he doesn't trust anybody.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.900
I know how he feels.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.800
If you were to make the offer,

25:47.800 --> 25:50.000
I could let him know 
next time he reaches out.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.700
Let me make some calls.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.000

It's just straight ahead, for a little bit more.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.400

26:19.700 --> 26:23.100

talking about granting Qui asylum.

39:07.500 --> 39:11.100
I'll see you in the
 Chamber, Mal. For the vote.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.800
My door being opened is 
not a management philosophy.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.300
<i>It's for ventilation.</i>

39:36.300 --> 39:39.000
Sasha just called from the hospital. 
She is watching telly.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.300
Dunkley didn't turn up for the Sky News.

39:41.500 --> 39:44.200
It's like herding cats...

39:44.200 --> 39:47.400
Mate, if it helps you, 
than I can do it. Not a problem.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.800
Seriously.

39:52.400 --> 39:57.200
<i>You've reached Harriet Dunkley. I can't take your call
 right now. Leave a message and I will get back to you.</i>

39:57.400 --> 40:00.400
Hey, Harriet, it's Gus. 
Call me when you get this.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.200
<i>Better get a lawyer, she's been
 detained under the ASIO act.</i>

40:14.200 --> 40:17.900
The only way to get to her is a complaint to
 the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.

40:17.900 --> 40:19.900
You didn't hear it from me.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.000
<i>I don't know who you are!</i>

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
[Calling]

40:38.500 --> 40:40.200
Thanks, Gus.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.200
Newspapers may be dying, but

40:43.200 --> 40:46.200
perversely, we still retain
 the most expensive lawyers.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.200
Now, if Safer Australia goes through,

40:50.200 --> 40:52.900
our lawyer won't be able
 to bail you out next time.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.900
<i>You would rot in a cell.</i>

40:55.100 --> 40:57.900
Come on, I don't wanna miss the vote.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.900
[Voice Mail] 
<i>You have 47 new messages.</i>

41:10.900 --> 41:14.600
<i>Message received at 7h53 am.</i>

41:14.600 --> 41:17.300
<i>It's Sandy Dalgety. 
Max's mother.</i>

41:17.300 --> 41:20.700
<i>That photo you showed on the telly,
 we know who that is.</i>

41:20.700 --> 41:21.900
<i>Call me.</i>

41:23.900 --> 41:25.700
Listen to this.

41:25.800 --> 41:29.200
<i>Attorney General Bailey will 
be appearing any moment now,</i>

41:29.200 --> 41:32.800
<i>following the successful passing 
of the Safer Australia bill.</i>

41:32.800 --> 41:34.600
- Here she comes. Senator Bailey?
- Senator Bailey?

41:34.600 --> 41:40.400
[Journalists asking questions at the same time}

41:40.400 --> 41:42.700
- <i>... that I give for a 
conscious vote on this bill?</i>

41:42.700 --> 41:47.200
When it comes to the safety of Australians,
 the Government is united.

41:47.200 --> 41:51.500
- Senator Bailey, does this new legislation
 make you the most powerful person in the country?

41:51.500 --> 41:55.700
[Laughs] The Prime Minister might have 
something to say about that,

41:55.700 --> 41:58.600
not to mention every 
shock jock around the country...

41:58.600 --> 42:01.900
[Laughs]
- <i>Do you consider that this is the first real success for your Govt.?</i>

42:07.400 --> 42:09.000
You must be proud.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
You are a legacy.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.600
And you are a Dunkley lurking in the shadows?

42:13.600 --> 42:17.200
I guess the shadows are now 
officially Government property, thanks to you.

42:17.300 --> 42:20.300
No more secrets. No more privacy.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.000
Look...

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
- If there are people and they pose a threat...
- And who decides that?

42:26.000 --> 42:27.900
- Catriona Bailey?

42:28.700 --> 42:32.000
Must you go and right these days, 
Mal, for selling your soul.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
[Door opens]

42:46.800 --> 42:49.900
<i>This is their son. 
The real Max.</i>

42:49.900 --> 42:52.500
<i>Yeah. And that's 
Dan White, in the left.</i>

42:52.800 --> 42:54.800
<i>Max and Dan were close.</i>

42:55.700 --> 42:59.200
And Dan stayed in touch with 
his parents, after Max died.

42:59.400 --> 43:03.300
He used to send them a card 
once a year, on the anniversary.

43:05.600 --> 43:10.700
Max's parents are gonna go through their 
things and... send me whatever they can find on Dan.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.600
<i>Why would he use Max's name?</i>

43:19.800 --> 43:21.900
Wha... What was he hiding?

43:23.900 --> 44:12.300
[Sabine singing softly in Chinese]

44:12.300 --> 44:15.500
<i>Absolutely no smoke 
and mirrors here.</i>

44:15.500 --> 44:17.400
Like the name says,

44:17.400 --> 44:22.300
the Safer Australia Agency is 
all about making Australia safer.

44:22.300 --> 44:25.000
[Interviewer] <i>I'm sure there will be much discussion
 in the days and weeks to come,</i>

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
<i>about this controversial...</i>

44:30.000 --> 44:32.900
- <i>I had to to a live cross.</i>

44:33.500 --> 44:37.800
The Prime Minister is about 
to apologize for the death of your sailor.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.700
I have a request...

44:43.100 --> 44:46.800
Can you keep an eye on Paxton? 
At close range?

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
He could be a problem.

44:55.300 --> 44:58.000
The Safer Australia Agency...

45:00.400 --> 45:03.300
- Whiskey?
- Of course...

45:08.400 --> 45:11.800
- Gan bei.
- Gan bei.
