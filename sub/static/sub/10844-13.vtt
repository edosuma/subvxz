00:00.400 --> 00:04.179
Two excellent candidates for the deputy
headship, so they both get the job.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.719
Just imagine what you could be like
with a bit of practice, huh?!

00:09.720 --> 00:12.079
I can't, can I?
I haven't got a guitar.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.960
Don't want anything to
do with these losers.

00:13.961 --> 00:15.839
That's my decision, not yours.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.839
If you want a guitar,
I'll get you one.

00:18.840 --> 00:22.159
We need the numbers today. One of
the downsides of management, that...

00:22.160 --> 00:25.679
having to trot out the party line,
mmm? I'm a teacher,

00:25.680 --> 00:27.860
which means trying to inspire
then educate the kids.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.040
My department, my methods.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.400
How did we do
on attendances last week?

01:24.680 --> 01:26.359
We... Er, better.

01:26.360 --> 01:30.319
Only 14 cases of truancy.
Usual suspects.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.319
"Only"? I think Tom's saying
we're moving in the right direction.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.260
Well, it's not good enough.

01:36.261 --> 01:38.199
We need to inspire each and
every one of these kids.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.799
Er, with respect, I don't think
any of us are capable of that.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.159
Well, I have a secret weapon.
Really? What?

01:45.160 --> 01:46.359
Not what.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.999
Who.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.600
ROCK MUSIC PLAYS

02:09.160 --> 02:11.759
Looks like fun.
Yeah, well, I aim to please.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.800
You're doing very well so far.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.639
What do you reckon?
Yeah, it's nice. Nice...

02:27.640 --> 02:29.279
OK.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.239
Well, it's not as if
she's been on holiday.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.999
Yeah, well, I'm just
happy to have her home.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.320
Listen, there's not a day
gone by when I haven't

02:37.321 --> 02:39.639
thought of your sister
cooped up in that cell.

02:39.640 --> 02:43.119
And this is a new start.
Go back to normal.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.039
Sitting round the dinner table,
taking the mick out of each other.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.959
Arguing about who's better-looking
- Robbie Williams or Jason Orange.

02:49.960 --> 02:54.359
I'm not stupid. Lindsey's going to
find it tough. I know that.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.720
But we can help her find her feet.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.839
Everything's OK, isn't it?

03:03.840 --> 03:06.479
It's fine.
You're going to be late for school.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.759
Well, why can't I go with you?
It's just for one day.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.879
She'll be here when you get back.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.920
Listen, love, we just have to
tread carefully, OK?

03:17.120 --> 03:19.240
Now go on, you're going to be late.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.159
See you later.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.520
Bye.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.119
Ah-ha! The oasis of calm.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.159
Linda Radleigh. New head of English.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.199
Hi. I'm Sian Diamond, deputy head.
Er, this is Matt, music...

03:33.200 --> 03:36.999
Chalky, maths.
Er, Tom Clarkson, one of yours...

03:37.000 --> 03:39.479
Morning, and the other deputy head.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.639
And this is Grantly...Budgen.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.359
He's been doing a sterling job
as acting head of department.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.439
You knew?

03:47.440 --> 03:50.719
I only found out this morning,
let's just move on, hey?

03:50.720 --> 03:54.239
That man has brushed me aside without
so much as a "by your leave"!

03:54.240 --> 03:56.159
I'm sure he meant nothing by it.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.559
I am this school's elder statesman,

03:58.560 --> 04:02.119
and it's about time
someone taught Michael respect.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.239
Hello, you!

04:03.240 --> 04:06.919
I've got a bottle of single malt
in the car with your name on it.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.279
You shouldn't have.
It was a get-well present,

04:09.280 --> 04:11.560
but you slipped under the radar
after the stabbing.

04:11.561 --> 04:13.360
I'm sure everybody will
make you feel at home.

04:13.361 --> 04:15.159
I've never been
head-hunted before.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.319
We've known each other
since teacher training.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.678
This is her first HOD post,
but not before time.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.439
Flattery will get you everywhere.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.679
She'll be shadowing you two today,
getting a feel for the department.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.279
Excuse me. Tom how are you fixed
later on? One of our Year 11s

04:28.280 --> 04:31.959
needs a spot of pastoral care -
Emily James? Oh. Trouble at home?

04:31.960 --> 04:35.519
Potentially, yeah. Her sister's out
of prison today. What did she do?

04:35.520 --> 04:37.679
Manslaughter.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.079
Pleaded self-defence.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.599
Don't they all? Kid should never have
gone to prison in the first place.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.719
The courts obviously didn't think so.
Linda...

04:45.720 --> 04:48.159
Her father was sexually abusing her.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.959
Sorry, I've already drawn the
short straw for lunchtime detention.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.439
Oh, I don't mind. She can help me get
my bearings - my own Passepartout!

04:55.440 --> 04:59.399
Just make sure she stays in school.
So what's the deal?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.759
Mrs James hasn't heard from
Lindsey in weeks.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.479
Seems she doesn't want to come home.
She needs to find out what's wrong.

05:05.480 --> 05:08.639
Emily turning up at the prison
is the last thing she needs.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.759
Doesn't this Emily have a right
to know? It's for her own good.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.999
"Children abdicate responsibility
because the system encourages them."

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Isn't that one of yours?
Everything has a context.

05:22.560 --> 05:26.319
Right, now remember, this is a new
week so I want your best behaviour.

05:26.320 --> 05:30.159
Whatever. I mean it, Madi. That
was your first and last exclusion.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.159
Sian's got enough on her plate
as it is. Listen, do me a favour...

05:33.160 --> 05:36.319
Put one of them up
in your form room, and you.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.639
I can count on the pair of you
to be there, right? You are kidding?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.679
What with him keeping me up
last night?

05:41.680 --> 05:43.720
I couldn't sleep, that's all!

05:45.240 --> 05:49.679
Listen, mate, is there anything
on your mind? Just drop it, yeah?

05:49.680 --> 05:52.679
Come on, mate you can talk to me...

05:52.680 --> 05:54.120
All right, Em - when's this party?

05:54.121 --> 05:57.519
You're joking, right? Your sister's
going to want to let her hair down.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.759
After everything she's been through?

05:59.760 --> 06:02.799
No way. I'm taking it nice and easy.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.959
Oi! Oi!
Don't go flashing that about!

06:05.960 --> 06:09.279
It's not like I can practise
at home, is it?

06:09.280 --> 06:12.879
Can't hear above the telly.
Well, your mum needs her hearing tested!

06:12.880 --> 06:15.759
She needs a kick up the backside.
What's up?

06:15.760 --> 06:18.359
Liam's not coming home.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.199
Social services
came to do an assessment,

06:21.200 --> 06:23.079
and my mum couldn't be bothered

06:23.080 --> 06:26.799
getting out of her PJs. You two need to
team up and sort both your mums out.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.239
My situation and hers
isn't the same.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.079
No offence, but we're
not exactly chavs, are we?

06:32.080 --> 06:36.359
Who are you calling a chav...?!
Hey, you two! Pack it in!

06:36.360 --> 06:40.279
She started it! I don't care.
BELL RINGS

06:40.280 --> 06:41.440
Class - now!

06:45.720 --> 06:48.359
Welcome to Waterloo Road.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.719
You know, Michael and I always said
we'd end up working together.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.199
Yeah, he said you were at teacher
training college. Oh, many moons ago.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.079
We thought we'd change the world.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.399
Well, Michael's certainly
made a start.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.839
We've bumped into each other
on the conference circuit ever since.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.399
Well, hotel bars, mainly.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.199
Turns out we're both suckers for
a single malt.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.919
God, that makes me sound like
such a lush. Oh, not at all.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.160
All right, darling?

07:12.161 --> 07:16.119
Hey! This is my husband, Jez,
and this is Linda Radleigh.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.359
Hi... Well, er,
I'll leave you to it.

07:19.360 --> 07:24.479
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
No, it's fine. Is it?

07:24.480 --> 07:27.599
Only I got up this morning
and you were gone.

07:27.600 --> 07:31.519
I'm sorry, I should've left you a note.
Michael called a meeting, first thing.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.439
It's OK.
Things will calm down eventually.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.679
Yeah, well, I wish I could say
the same about Zack. Not again.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.919
Yeah. I found his sheets
in the dryer. I mean, he's 14!

07:40.920 --> 07:43.679
So, he wet the bed.
It's not the end of the world.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.799
It's probably just the upheaval.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.399
Would you talk to him?
I reckon he'll open up to you.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.199
He won't talk to me. I'm hardly
flavour of the month, am I?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.680
Please, cos...

07:53.960 --> 07:55.799
..he just won't open up to me.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.360
You'll find a way.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.279
Oh! You should have got her acacias.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.519
Sorry?

08:22.520 --> 08:25.079
Floriography.
Language of flowers.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.319
The Victorians had way too much
time on their hands.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.799
Yellow acacias mean secret love.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.279
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just the messenger.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.840
It's...

08:39.039 --> 08:42.039
I haven't got the guts
to ask her face-to-face.

08:42.039 --> 08:44.000
Faint heart never won fair maiden.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.799
How was the tour? Eye-opening.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.639
A hotbed of romance.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.559
That's teenagers for you.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.399
Well, I wasn't
talking about the students.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.119
I just met Sian's husband. Jez?

09:03.120 --> 09:05.159
I would never have put
those two together.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.679
How's your classroom?

09:06.680 --> 09:10.679
It's nice.
Just needs zhuzhing up a bit.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.920
Sounds ominous.

09:11.921 --> 09:15.599
I wanted to say thanks
for the opportunity.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.199
I'm sure you had plenty of
other people in mind. No contest.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.919
I don't have time to micro-manage.
I need self-starters on my team.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.599
You won't regret it. I promise.

09:24.600 --> 09:29.079
You've a free hand with your department.
Anybody gives you any grief, let me know.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.400
Aye-aye, captain.

09:37.720 --> 09:41.319
All right, sir? Not really, no.
Have any of you seen my guitar?

09:41.320 --> 09:43.760
If I do,
I'll give it a good plucking.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.959
What's up with Wilding,
has he ran out of hair gel?

09:49.960 --> 09:52.959
Looks like you had most of it.
You know, gotta make an effort.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.319
Never know who might be
giving you the eye.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.559
Have you not got the message, or
do I have to spell it out for you?

09:58.560 --> 10:02.759
You can spell, too? Did you learn that
in the ASBO class? Cheeky little...

10:02.760 --> 10:04.479
You two. Curb it.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.080
Inside, now, please.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.959
I told you not to wind him up.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.439
Own goal, mate. Own goal.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.319
This is my classroom.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.759
Where's the door?

10:18.760 --> 10:22.959
Michael's idea. Encourages
transparency and cohesion.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.319
Apparently.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.039
And this lovely lot are my year 13s.
So, if you'd like to join me.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.519
Actually I think I'll sit in
on Grantly's class.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.880
Your wish is my command.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.720
The skin cracks...

10:42.880 --> 10:45.559
..like a pod.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.440
Does anyone know
what the poet is referring to?

10:53.200 --> 10:56.200
The scorched earth, write it down.

10:59.640 --> 11:03.199
Hey, you, whiteboard's that-a-way.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.399
Sorry, Miss. I've got to get this
finished, it's for my sister.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.759
So you're Emily James.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.559
How do you know?

11:10.560 --> 11:13.879
Just get on with your work.
Am I in trouble or something?

11:13.880 --> 11:16.280
I've been asked to
keep an eye on you, that's all.

11:16.281 --> 11:17.599
Why? What have I done?

11:17.600 --> 11:19.959
Don't worry. It's not you.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.319
Well, what is it, then?

11:22.320 --> 11:25.279
Well, your mum called... My mum?

11:25.280 --> 11:28.679
When? Has this got
something to do with my sister?

11:28.680 --> 11:32.039
The best thing you can do is stay
in school, let your mum deal with it.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.999
Deal with what?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.399
Tell me!

11:36.400 --> 11:40.799
She's a bit worried your sister might not
be coming home. I'm sure it's nothing.

11:40.800 --> 11:45.079
I take it you aren't enraptured
by my teaching style.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.879
Sorry. It's just...

11:46.880 --> 11:51.080
regurgitating facts kind of went out
with elbow patches and tank tops.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.640
Though that one is very nice.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.479
And how do you propose
we enlighten these lost souls?

12:00.480 --> 12:01.759
BELL RINGS

12:01.760 --> 12:05.000
Right, everyone. Follow me.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.079
I thought you had a double period.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.839
Linda is about to show me where I've
been going wrong all these years.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.080
Well, the more the merrier, eh?

12:20.600 --> 12:23.959
Mum? It's me. will you call me
when you get this message?

12:23.960 --> 12:26.399
Ah, no happy ever after? Shame.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.759
Well, you'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

12:28.760 --> 12:31.120
If you ask me, your brother's
better off in care.

12:31.121 --> 12:33.959
Er, Liam's got no choice.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.520
Sounds like your sister
doesn't even want to come home.

12:38.800 --> 12:43.079
Trudi! I'm sorry, I shouldn't have wound
your brother up. I won't do it again.

12:43.080 --> 12:46.319
Look, the party. I made a mistake.
I don't know what I was doing.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.720
I had a pretty good idea.
Take the hint, will you?

12:48.721 --> 12:50.919
It's not going to happen.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.439
Come on, at least give me
a reason, then? Why do you think?

12:54.440 --> 12:57.359
I'm not scared of your brother.
He's out on licence.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.080
I'm not doing this to protect YOU.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.239
""Brass, copper, aluminium,
plastic buckets,

13:11.240 --> 13:14.319
"frantic hands like naked children
screaming in the liquid sun,

13:14.320 --> 13:16.639
"their highlights polished
to perfection.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.400
"Flashing light, as the blessing
sings over their small bones!"

13:21.760 --> 13:25.239
So what does the metre
tell us about the poem?

13:25.240 --> 13:27.679
Yes? Sorry, don't know your name.
Scout.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.200
It's like a dripping tap,
and then it changes to like, a gush.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.719
All hail Scout!

13:34.720 --> 13:37.879
All very "a la mode", I'm sure.
Grantly...

13:37.880 --> 13:40.479
What, you don't approve?

13:40.480 --> 13:44.999
Nearly 30 years
I've been doing this job.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.439
Fads ebb and flow like the tides
pounding the cliffs of common sense,

13:50.440 --> 13:53.439
but they are immutable.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.360
I'll leave the class
in your capable hands.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.519
Er, where do you think you're going?

14:01.520 --> 14:03.440
Right, let's get rid of
this rubbish.

14:03.441 --> 14:06.799
Er, I need the toilet, Miss.
Really?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.719
You can't not let me go.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.360
It's against my human rights.
Fine. After you.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.760
I don't need a chaperone.

14:22.761 --> 14:24.479
I do know where I'm going.
That makes two of us.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.639
Oi!

14:25.640 --> 14:28.880
A sorry wouldn't go amiss.
Why aren't you boys in class?

14:32.920 --> 14:34.560
Emily?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.680
Emily? Stop mucking about.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.480
Emily?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.720
Emily!

14:54.600 --> 14:56.399
Stupid thing.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.320
Problem, Janeece?

14:59.960 --> 15:01.840
Ta-da! I only passed my
administration course.

15:01.841 --> 15:03.719
A merit, no less.

15:03.720 --> 15:07.439
Well, maybe we should sign you up
for a basic DIY course.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.919
Oh, no more probation for me, then?

15:10.920 --> 15:13.279
Congratulations.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.719
Linda! Have you met
our new head of English?

15:16.720 --> 15:20.319
This is Janeece, my secretary.
Personal assistant, nice to meet you.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.639
Likewise.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.999
Linda's a one-off.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.520
A real inspiration,
and the kids love her.

15:27.640 --> 15:30.799
Yeah, well, if there's anything
that you need, just ask.

15:30.800 --> 15:35.079
I was wondering. Do you still have
Lindsey James's file? Problem?

15:35.080 --> 15:40.119
Just familiarising myself with the family.
See? That's what I expect from you.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.600
Thorough. I'll leave you to it.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.479
Lovely flowers, Janeece.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.200
Ah, they're from a secret admirer.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.120
All yours. Thanks.

15:57.120 --> 16:01.639
You and I both know he should have
advertised the job internally.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.679
I appreciate what you're saying.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.559
And you stood by and let it happen.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.519
I didn't know.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.959
I didn't!

16:09.960 --> 16:13.439
Even his storm troopers
are kept in the dark.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.360
The man is acting like a dictator.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.900
Lost your way again, Janeece?
Er, no, actually,

16:20.901 --> 16:23.279
I need a sort of vase
to put these in.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.839
They're gonna wilt otherwise.
Are you brightening up the office?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.600
I've got a secret admirer.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.100
So, em, what's this I'm
hearing about a fit club?

16:33.101 --> 16:35.599
Oh, why, are you interested?

16:35.600 --> 16:37.000
I love getting sweaty, me.

16:37.001 --> 16:40.679
Count me in. I'll help to
organise it, if you like?

16:40.680 --> 16:45.839
I know my star jumps from my squat thrusts.
Out to impress Janeece, eh?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.240
I'll look forward to it, Chalky.

16:47.241 --> 16:51.439
Hey... All right? How did it go with Zack?
I haven't had a chance yet.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.199
Oh, well, he's down in the canteen
now if you want to catch him.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.720
You know what, good idea. Yeah.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.919
Sian, are you free to go over the
departmental budgets with me later?

17:00.920 --> 17:04.679
Yeah, course.
Er, sorry, did I miss something?

17:04.680 --> 17:09.159
Sian was going to cast
a forensic eye over the budgets.

17:09.160 --> 17:13.878
Well, you know what they say. Two
heads are better than one. Great.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.079
Thanks.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.519
Tough morning?

17:16.520 --> 17:19.878
Worse. Somebody stole his guitar,
apparently.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.679
I've had her since university.

17:22.680 --> 17:26.720
Tenner says it's already
in a pawnbroker's window.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.719
Excuse me. I need to see my sister.
She's being released today.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.479
Lindsey, Lindsey James.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.919
James? Er...

17:50.920 --> 17:53.479
Right, James...

17:53.480 --> 17:56.799
I'm afraid you've missed her.
She's gone. She went first thing.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.079
Where? Don't ask me.
I just get paid to jangle the keys.

18:00.080 --> 18:06.279
♪ No matter how well
you play your hand... ♪

18:06.280 --> 18:08.839
Emily!

18:08.840 --> 18:11.279
Not so fast.
I've got to get home.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.120
The only place you're
going is back to school.

18:13.121 --> 18:14.959
But Lindsey'll be there.
She's not here.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.079
Look, just wait.

18:17.080 --> 18:21.040
Fine, I'll give you a lift,
all right?

18:25.160 --> 18:29.200
Can you pack it in for five minutes?
Who made you the boss of me?

18:31.480 --> 18:34.159
Is that... Oi!
That's my guitar? Oi!

18:34.160 --> 18:38.160
Stealing people's property is
a very serious offence. I didn't.

18:39.920 --> 18:44.279
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
march you both to the headmaster's office?

18:44.280 --> 18:46.999
Ah, give her a break, sir.
She just really wants to learn.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.599
Theft is theft,
however well-intentioned.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.240
Sorry, sir.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.359
Strike one.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.960
You nicked that guitar?
It's the thought that counts, right?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.519
Lindsey!

19:22.520 --> 19:24.039
Lindsey!

19:24.040 --> 19:26.320
What are you doing home?
Where's Lindsey?

19:28.040 --> 19:32.839
Linda Radleigh, Emily's English teacher.
I'm sorry, love. I tried. I really did.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.440
What do you mean, you tried?

19:36.600 --> 19:39.120
She can't face it.
Too many memories.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.879
Where is she? I don't know.

19:43.880 --> 19:47.919
You don't know? She was granted an early
morning release, she didn't tell me.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.840
I thought she was still there.

19:49.841 --> 19:51.759
But why didn't you tell
me there was a problem?

19:51.760 --> 19:54.839
Listen, I only just found out
this morning. You're doing it again.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.040
Don't lie to me.
I know you spoke to school.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.959
I just needed to speak to Lindsey on
my own. I didn't want to worry you.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.080
How long have you known for?

20:06.360 --> 20:08.399
I had my suspicions.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.359
I thought I was just being
a typical mum and over-worrying,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.220
but then when she didn't
show for the visit...

20:13.221 --> 20:15.079
That was three weeks ago!

20:15.080 --> 20:18.119
You told me she was fine!
She didn't return my letters.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.399
I thought
if I could just talk to her...

20:20.400 --> 20:22.239
Save you the heartache.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.639
And her phone calls?
You lied about them too?

20:25.640 --> 20:27.439
I'm not a kid any more.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.240
I could've handled it.
I could've helped.

20:29.241 --> 20:33.399
Nothing would've changed Lindsey's
mind, I promise you. Promise me?

20:33.400 --> 20:36.759
You expect me
to believe a word you say?

20:36.760 --> 20:38.040
Emily! Wait! Please.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.679
Maybe you should
let the dust settle.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.040
I'll look after her.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.959
How was your week off?
Manage to shift your hangover?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.759
Bet your house is like comedy
central at the moment, innit?

20:55.760 --> 20:58.999
Nah, Sian's tripping over herself
to be nice to me.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.039
It was a great flat-warming,
by the way.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.279
Well, what I can remember of it.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.159
You can party hard, I'll give you
that. So when's the next one?

21:07.160 --> 21:09.319
I wouldn't hold your breath.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.960
We'll be lucky
if we make this month's rent. Shame.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.599
What did she want? What?
Apart from my body and my brains?

21:23.600 --> 21:24.639
Body, maybe.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.480
She was just being friendly,
that's all.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.240
How can Lindsey do this to me?

21:36.240 --> 21:38.719
How can she leave me with her?

21:38.720 --> 21:41.239
Your mum only did
what she thought was right.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.920
You have no idea what it's like.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.239
The last two years...

21:47.240 --> 21:49.199
it's been awful.

21:49.200 --> 21:53.280
Come on, hey, it's OK.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.519
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

21:56.520 --> 22:00.719
Why don't we do this somewhere
comfier? Give me half an hour

22:00.720 --> 22:03.760
and I'll meet you in
the pastoral care room, eh?

22:05.360 --> 22:07.159
What's the point?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.599
Nobody cares how I feel.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.720
Hey. I care.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.519
Fit Club does exactly
what it says on the tin.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.880
But it's not just for students,
it's for staff too.

22:24.881 --> 22:26.959
And if Mr Chalk can do it,
anyone can.

22:26.960 --> 22:31.119
Now the final exercise
on the circuit is the plank.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.680
I'm going to need a volunteer.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.720
Janeece. Ooh!

22:37.320 --> 22:40.000
Press-up position but
on your elbows and forearms, please.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.400
Oi, what do you think you're playing at?
Oh, so I'm not invisible, then.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.199
Zack, mate, come on!

22:47.200 --> 22:50.879
Do I have to hold this
for much longer? Sorry. Right, OK.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.239
No, keep your back straight,
that's it. There you go.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.679
Oh, I hope that
you've got nice warm hands.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.839
Sorry, I don't think
that's appropriate, Mr Diamond.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.879
Thanks for your input, Mr Chalk.
OK, Janeece, up you get.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.599
Right, now everyone go to a station

23:05.600 --> 23:08.239
and you're going to move in
a clockwise direction until

23:08.240 --> 23:10.639
you've completed every exercise
on the circuit.

23:10.640 --> 23:14.440
You've got one minute on each.
Wait for my whistle.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.920
Quicker!

23:17.200 --> 23:19.319
Right, on my whistle.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.600
Oh, that's a good look, Chalky.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.280
WHISTLE BLOWS
Get on with it.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.200
Straight backs.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.959
Keep going, boys, come on.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.880
You can do better than that,
come on.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.920
WHISTLE BLOWS

24:22.560 --> 24:24.840
WHISTLE BLOWS

24:33.480 --> 24:37.159
Someone's had their three
Shredded Wheat, in't they, mate?

24:37.160 --> 24:39.760
Ah, come on Chalky,
you can do better than that.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.880
Timber!
Oh, my God, Chalky! What's up?

24:44.920 --> 24:47.839
Oh, my God! Umm, compressions.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.439
What are you doing?
He's having a heart attack!

24:50.440 --> 24:52.919
Just stop!
I've lost count now!

24:52.920 --> 24:55.519
Look, he's got a pulse.
You'll kill him. Please don't die.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.760
Please don't die. Right,
Janeece, get an ambulance now.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.439
You're going to be all right,
Chalky, mate.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.960
Ambulance is on its way, son.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.599
Oi! Pick it up!

25:17.600 --> 25:19.239
Make me.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.959
And I thought you were
supposed to be pretty bright.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.879
You don't know anything about me.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.559
I know a stuck-up cow
when I see one.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.280
Should've known you're all talk.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.959
You don't know how lucky you are.
You've got your sister back.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.140
Just try being grateful
for once in your life!

25:35.141 --> 25:37.320
Lindsey's not coming home!

25:45.120 --> 25:46.799
It's well mad.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.359
Chalky's not even that old.
About the same age as my dad.

25:49.360 --> 25:52.600
Just goes to show, don't it.
Carpe diem and all that.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.520
Finn. We've been through this.
It doesn't mean we

25:57.521 --> 26:00.119
can't be friends.
We can still chill together.

26:00.120 --> 26:03.119
Tariq wouldn't like it.
He can't do compromise.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.759
He doesn't have to know.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.920
You wouldn't tell anyone?
Not even Josh?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.080
Not if you don't want me to.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.440
Yeah?

26:21.320 --> 26:23.039
Any luck?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.440
Lindsey's number doesn't work.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.040
Is that her?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.440
We went to Leeds. See the ballet.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.880
Lindsey loved all that.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.799
Said she'd move there one day.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.880
Just so she could go every week.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.080
I can't remember the last time
I was that happy.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.720
Were you close?

26:54.720 --> 26:58.079
We were, but it's not so easy

26:58.080 --> 27:01.439
when you're sat opposite
each other in a visiting room.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.760
Suppose.

27:04.920 --> 27:08.519
Why would she want to know
what goes on in school?

27:08.520 --> 27:11.080
All she could talk about
was life inside.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.960
Different world.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.880
No wonder she wanted to start again.

27:18.881 --> 27:20.919
I would.

27:20.920 --> 27:24.159
Who wants to be
the daughter of a paedo?

27:24.160 --> 27:26.000
So...

27:27.960 --> 27:29.320
Stuff everyone else.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.240
Be who you want to be.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.480
I've got to go.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.280
I'll go with him.
Just keep me updated.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.680
Look, you're going to be all right,
do you hear me?

28:30.360 --> 28:32.879
I was beginning to think
you'd changed your mind.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.959
Slipped out the back door.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.759
How's Emily?
Oh, all taken care of.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.959
What's taken care of?

28:39.960 --> 28:43.639
Emily spoke to her mum.
She knows Lindsey's not coming home.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.919
Is she OK?
Oh, she's fine.

28:45.920 --> 28:49.879
How was your lesson with Grantly?
Prehistoric. The man's a dinosaur.

28:49.880 --> 28:52.040
And we know what
happened to them.

28:52.041 --> 28:54.199
Have you got a moment to sign
off on your department budget?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.040
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.999
I don't suppose
you've seen Emily James?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.159
AWOL again? Oh, dear.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.439
Once is careless.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.239
Twice is negligent.
OK, Grantly, I get it.

29:15.240 --> 29:17.039
You don't like me.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.359
But hey, news flash,
I couldn't give two hoots.

29:19.360 --> 29:20.999
Really(?)

29:21.000 --> 29:23.439
Michael's 100% behind me.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.399
He really values my opinion.

29:25.400 --> 29:28.679
You'd do very well to remember that.
Are you threatening me?

29:28.680 --> 29:32.119
You don't like the way I do things,
you know where the door is.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.159
In fact,

29:33.160 --> 29:35.400
I'd be happy to open it for you.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.120
Could I have your attention, please?

30:28.121 --> 30:31.319
I'm sure you've all heard
the news about Daniel.

30:31.320 --> 30:35.119
Is there any word from the hospital?
When I hear anything, I'll let you know.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.039
I will be arranging a replacement,

30:37.040 --> 30:41.119
but in the meantime, I'll be asking
some of you to step into the breach.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.839
And that's all. Back to work.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.199
Oh, business as usual.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.959
Chalky's a footnote. Grantly...

30:46.960 --> 30:50.640
No, no. If he has a grievance,
let's hear it.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.239
We are working our fingers
to the bone - for what?

30:56.240 --> 31:00.399
For your apparatchiks to waltz in
and steal all the glory.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.959
Excuse me?

31:01.960 --> 31:06.199
I should have been offered the
chance to apply for the HOD post.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.000
You really want to do this here?

31:09.680 --> 31:11.599
Why not?

31:11.600 --> 31:15.399
Since you are such a fan
of transparency and cohesion.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.640
All right.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.359
I didn't think
you were a strong candidate.

31:21.360 --> 31:24.359
You were happy enough
to make me acting head.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.999
Tom's deputy head,
that left me with a choice of one.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.439
That doesn't mean
that you can flout the rules.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.680
There are procedures.

31:30.681 --> 31:34.360
The board of governors agreed I could
bring in key members of staff.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.440
Oh, I thought my ears were burning.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.239
It's against the law
and you are not above it.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.320
You cannot bring in who you like,
how you like. Those were my terms.

31:53.360 --> 31:56.560
A school cannot be run
without teachers, right?

31:57.680 --> 31:59.319
Grantly, get to the point.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.158
What is it
that you're trying to say?

32:01.159 --> 32:02.640
You've left me no option.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.959
As of now, we are on strike.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.159
Don't be so ridiculous!

32:08.160 --> 32:10.039
Until the union gets back to us,

32:10.040 --> 32:12.440
we shall not be
entering the classroom.

32:13.440 --> 32:18.160
No, he's right. The union's got
guidelines - this is discrimination.

32:20.720 --> 32:23.439
Are you really sure about this?

32:23.440 --> 32:25.800
Mm-hmm.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.279
I'm just saying, Michael
was the one who appointed me.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.879
It just seems a bit disloyal.

33:04.880 --> 33:08.599
This is about standing shoulder
to shoulder with your comrades.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.120
Or did you join the union
for the free pen?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.759
Go on, Sir. Stick it to the man!

33:13.760 --> 33:14.800
What's all this?

33:14.801 --> 33:16.479
Teachers are on strike!

33:16.480 --> 33:18.599
Listen up, everybody,
it's party time,

33:18.600 --> 33:20.000
cos teachers are on strike!

33:20.001 --> 33:21.879
Wooo!

33:21.880 --> 33:23.879
Everyone, teachers are on strike!

33:23.880 --> 33:25.319
Scout.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.279
Have you seen Em? No, why?

33:27.280 --> 33:29.800
Well, there's nothing in her locker.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.559
Excuse me?

33:49.560 --> 33:51.400
Have you got room for a little one?

33:51.401 --> 33:53.599
Where are you heading? Leeds.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.160
Must be your lucky day.

33:58.440 --> 33:59.920
Cheers.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.119
Lindsay this, Lindsay that.

34:10.120 --> 34:13.079
That's all Em's been banging
on about for the past few months.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.840
What? And now she's not coming home?

34:14.841 --> 34:18.679
Well, it doesn't necessarily mean
she's run away. Oh, Scout, tell her.

34:18.679 --> 34:20.920
She's pretty cut up about it.
Let's not jump the gun.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.159
She's not answering her mobile!
OK, OK!

34:23.159 --> 34:26.119
Any idea where she might have gone?
You know, people, places.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.478
Leeds. She said her sister
wanted to move there.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.920
It's a long shot.
What if she's trying to find her?

34:30.920 --> 34:33.501
You're in charge of the map.
Keep trying her mobile.

34:33.502 --> 34:36.080
Phone us if you hear anything.
Come on.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.800
PHONE RINGS

34:50.520 --> 34:53.360
Someone's desperate.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.119
What was it?

34:56.120 --> 34:58.239
Row with your fella?

34:58.240 --> 35:00.680
I've not got a boyfriend.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.999
How many teachers are we down?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.519
Seven at the last count.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.720
Make that eight.

35:07.721 --> 35:09.319
Jez is there too.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.680
There's no way we can cover
that amount of staff.

35:11.681 --> 35:13.719
Then we utilise
the teaching assistants.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.279
They can supervise classes
and hand out worksheets.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.300
Keep this disruption to
an absolute minimum.

35:18.301 --> 35:20.320
I think it might be a
bit late for that.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.919
The union won't back this.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.840
The afternoon off?
There must be a God!

35:25.841 --> 35:27.599
Let's hope it's smiling on Chalky.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.839
Yeah. So what are we going to do
then? Just chill back at ours?

35:30.840 --> 35:32.839
No, I've got loads
of chemistry to do.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.239
Mrs Diamond wants three sides
on isotopes and atomic structures.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.440
Sounds riveting!

35:37.441 --> 35:40.599
And I've got to do notes on genetic
code and sexual reproduction.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.719
That's more my area of expertise.
Is that all you think about?

35:43.720 --> 35:46.118
All right! I'll just work on
my new business plan.

35:46.119 --> 35:47.160
What business plan?

35:47.161 --> 35:51.359
Actually, I think I'm just going to go
to the library and get my head down.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.559
Yeah, me too.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.760
See what you've done?

35:53.761 --> 35:57.159
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

35:57.160 --> 36:00.039
Back to lessons now! If the teachers
can't be bothered, why should we?

36:00.040 --> 36:01.960
Ten seconds, starting now.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.160
Knew it were too good to be true.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.120
There was nearly a God though.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.799
'Hello?'

36:20.800 --> 36:22.239
Hello, Em?

36:22.240 --> 36:24.000
'Got you! Leave a message.'

36:37.200 --> 36:38.599
So what's in Leeds?

36:38.600 --> 36:41.239
I'm...at uni.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.999
Brains and beauty, eh?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.920
Well, I'm not sure about that.

36:46.360 --> 36:50.480
I bet you're not short of offers,
stunner like you.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.319
I haven't really got time
for a relationship right now.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.439
I'm the same. Why tie yourself down?

36:59.440 --> 37:01.199
Plenty of time for all that.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.079
Exactly.

37:03.080 --> 37:05.799
Sow your oats while you're young.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.840
That's what I say.

37:13.120 --> 37:17.160
GIGGLING AND SHOUTING

37:20.080 --> 37:22.560
Everyone back to class now!

37:24.360 --> 37:25.680
NOW, do you understand me?

37:25.681 --> 37:27.399
Look out! Look out!

37:27.400 --> 37:29.080
SCREAMING

37:30.160 --> 37:33.439
Zack! Stop it! Stop it!

37:33.440 --> 37:35.520
Get out of my way.
What the hell do you think you're doing?

37:35.521 --> 37:37.599
Taking a leaf out
of Madi's book.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.719
Well, this isn't helping, is it?
Get to the cooler, now!

37:40.720 --> 37:43.220
Let's just get them in
the hall, all right?

37:43.221 --> 37:45.720
So we at least know where they are.
Hall - now!

37:57.680 --> 38:01.159
I thought you said Leeds.
A man's got to eat.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.999
But we were just at
a service station.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.159
Nah, soulless places.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.159
There's a beautiful spot
just up here.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.440
Trust me. You'll love it.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.799
Come on, Miss.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.000
Can't we just go home?

38:25.001 --> 38:28.479
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

38:43.120 --> 38:45.239
Miss, it's Denzil.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.879
What's he saying?
Emily's stuck in some van.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.020
He's really worried about her.

38:50.021 --> 38:52.160
What do you mean, "stuck"?
Shhh... Say it again?

38:53.400 --> 38:56.280
He's just come off the motorway -
junction 22. Take that.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.360
Open the door.

Open the door.

Open the door!

Open the door!

40:16.240 --> 40:18.879
Open the door NOW! Open it!

40:18.880 --> 40:21.679
Grantly's made it perfectly clear
where he stands.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.679
But we can still rescue this.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.759
Management require 48 hours' notice
for a strike - union rules.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.079
So?

40:29.080 --> 40:31.599
So they've made themselves
eligible for the sack.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.878
You're not serious?

40:32.879 --> 40:34.840
Our priority is
to provide our students

40:34.841 --> 40:36.639
with the best education possible.

40:36.640 --> 40:40.359
You can't do that
standing on a picket line.

40:40.360 --> 40:42.760
You can tell them they've
until the end of today. Me?

40:42.761 --> 40:45.079
Surely it's going to be better
coming from you.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.999
You'd rather I ask Sian?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.839
No...

40:48.840 --> 40:50.320
No, I'll do it.

40:54.960 --> 40:57.560
Leave me alone!
Open the door!

41:09.120 --> 41:11.119
Emily!

41:11.120 --> 41:13.719
Get him away from me.
What have you done to her?

41:13.720 --> 41:15.279
Nothing.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.279
Not that it's any of YOUR business.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.560
Well, it is my business.

41:18.561 --> 41:20.560
I'm her English teacher. Emily's 15!

41:20.561 --> 41:21.840
Eh?

41:23.240 --> 41:27.199
I thought I was doing her a favour.
This is the thanks I get?

41:27.200 --> 41:29.719
Well, I suggest you get in your van
and clear off.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.760
I need my keys.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.040
Here!

41:36.880 --> 41:39.160
Let's get you back
to your mum, eh?

41:39.161 --> 41:41.439
I'll give her a tinkle, get
her to meet us at school.

41:41.440 --> 41:43.359
I need to find my sister.

41:43.360 --> 41:46.679
You have to let her go,
for now at least.

41:46.680 --> 41:47.960
But why?

41:49.960 --> 41:51.719
Because she's... She's changed.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.759
She's a different person.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.400
Deep down you know that.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.480
Because I'm guessing you have, too.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.159
Everything used to be so simple.

42:03.160 --> 42:07.959
Lindsay needs time
to find out who she is.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.080
Move on with her life.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.280
You all do, eh?

42:14.800 --> 42:15.960
Come on.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.999
Up for visitors?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.160
Your daughter's having kittens
out there.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.679
It's a work colleague.

42:38.680 --> 42:41.640
Oh. I'll go and get her, shall I?

42:47.120 --> 42:49.759
Do you want to come in?

42:49.760 --> 42:51.560
Is he going to be OK?

42:54.680 --> 42:56.319
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

42:56.320 --> 42:57.800
Really?

43:03.920 --> 43:06.119
Thank God you're all right.

43:06.120 --> 43:10.000
I don't think I would've
forgiven myself if... You know...

43:11.040 --> 43:14.719
I didn't know you cared so much.
I nearly killed you!

43:14.720 --> 43:16.199
Sorry?

43:16.200 --> 43:18.079
It was that CPR.

43:18.080 --> 43:22.079
I think I need to take
a refreshers course.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.159
It's OK.

43:23.160 --> 43:25.199
What did the doc say?

43:25.200 --> 43:27.239
Turns out it was angina.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.239
What's that?

43:29.240 --> 43:31.160
Wake-up call.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.799
Do you know, there was one thought

43:35.800 --> 43:38.439
just kept going
round and round in my head...

43:38.440 --> 43:42.479
Who's going to miss me when
I'm gone? Hey, I'd miss you!

43:42.480 --> 43:47.199
You're the only one that saves me
any biscuits in the staff room.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.239
Stingy gits!

43:48.240 --> 43:50.280
There's something you should know.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.120
I...

43:54.440 --> 43:55.480
The flowers...

43:57.320 --> 43:58.800
It was...

44:01.720 --> 44:02.799
You?

44:02.800 --> 44:06.280
I thought perhaps we could...

44:08.840 --> 44:09.920
..go out?

44:11.680 --> 44:13.479
I'm touched, Chalky.

44:13.480 --> 44:16.239
I'll take that as a "No" then. No!

44:16.240 --> 44:18.159
I am, really.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.199
You're kind,

44:19.200 --> 44:22.640
funny, caring...

44:24.040 --> 44:26.919
Maybe if I was a bit older though.

44:26.920 --> 44:31.599
It was just meant to be a prank,
you know, a wind-up between mates.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.799
Got you!

44:32.800 --> 44:34.120
Listen, you...

44:36.240 --> 44:39.080
The right woman is out there,
somewhere.

44:40.840 --> 44:44.039
I'm going to come see you tomorrow.
Really?

44:44.040 --> 44:45.240
Try and stop me.

45:01.600 --> 45:02.959
Hey, what's going on?

45:02.960 --> 45:04.799
We're on strike. Apparently.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.599
But there's always room for you
on a picket line, Janeece.

45:07.600 --> 45:10.319
Oh, so I'm one of you when it suits?

45:10.320 --> 45:12.319
Um, how's Chalky? Is there any news?

45:12.320 --> 45:15.559
Yeah, he's all right.
The doctor said that he's got Angora.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.639
An-gina.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.439
Angora's a country, isn't it?

45:20.440 --> 45:22.119
Yeah, well... I knew that.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.439
I was just testing you.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.119
It's where the jumpers come from.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.360
HE SCOFFS

45:27.880 --> 45:30.719
Ah, come to join the proletariat?

45:30.720 --> 45:34.039
No, I didn't think so.
Here to...negotiate?

45:34.040 --> 45:35.880
Not exactly, no.

45:37.520 --> 45:39.279
Look, you're breaking union regs.

45:39.280 --> 45:42.239
Michael needs 48 hours' notice.

45:42.240 --> 45:46.599
Continue with this strike and you're
all eligible for the sack. Ha!

45:46.600 --> 45:49.020
Look, don't shoot the messenger.

45:49.021 --> 45:51.440
I think "turncoat" is the
word you're groping for.

45:53.240 --> 45:55.120
You should know,
Zack's in the cooler.

45:55.121 --> 45:58.279
He's been letting off
fire extinguishers.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.200
I'd better go and
deal with that.

46:00.201 --> 46:02.119
What about your comrades?
Family comes first.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.080
And what's your excuse?
Uh, mortgage? Sorry.

46:09.360 --> 46:11.439
First, the stunt in the yard,
now this.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.799
Do you want to get chucked out?
That's the general idea. You what?

46:14.800 --> 46:18.239
Face it, I'm an embarrassment.

46:18.240 --> 46:23.359
HE SIGHS
I'm very proud to call you my son.

46:23.360 --> 46:26.879
You and Madi will always
be my greatest achievement.

46:26.880 --> 46:30.799
Swiftly followed by the hat-trick I
scored against City in the FA Trophy.

46:30.800 --> 46:34.280
Why do you do that?
Cover everything serious with a joke.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.439
I'm sorry. It's...

46:38.440 --> 46:40.759
It's just your mum
was good at that stuff.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.840
But you don't even try.

46:50.520 --> 46:53.119
Look, erm...
It's just hard for me, Zack,

46:53.120 --> 46:55.839
being your teacher
and being your dad.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.719
The bed-wetting -
it's nothing to be ashamed of.

46:58.720 --> 47:03.359
I remember this one time, I was
doing night exercises with the TA...

47:03.360 --> 47:04.640
Here we go, any excuse.

47:04.641 --> 47:09.000
I was hunkered down in a foxhole,
right? And...I was bursting.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.399
I had no option,
I just had to pee myself.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.879
Is that true?

47:14.880 --> 47:16.199
Mm-hmm.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.999
I pretended it was sweat.
Lads didn't buy it though.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.199
Not for a second.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.440
But it turned out
it wasn't really a big deal.

47:29.160 --> 47:31.120
We're all still adjusting.

47:33.880 --> 47:36.880
But I will always be there for you.

47:37.880 --> 47:41.080
I mean, you and me, mate,
we're the A-Team.

47:43.680 --> 47:47.159
So why don't we all go out for a
Chinese tonight, eh? All four of us?

47:47.160 --> 47:50.559
As long as you don't start drumming
on the table with the chopsticks.

47:50.560 --> 47:53.159
It's embarrassing.
What about the walrus?

47:53.160 --> 47:56.320
Can I still do the walrus?
Come on!

48:00.040 --> 48:01.840
Emily!

48:03.760 --> 48:05.640
I'll leave you to it.

48:10.280 --> 48:11.839
Am I in trouble?

48:11.840 --> 48:13.880
I think we'll call this one a draw.

48:17.600 --> 48:20.559
A-ha! Present for you.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.959
Serious? Yep, one of
the students dropped out.

48:22.960 --> 48:27.719
So there's an empty seat in the
orchestra, if you're still interested?

48:27.720 --> 48:30.919
Oh, thanks, Sir! Come on.

48:30.920 --> 48:32.559
So you lost her twice?

48:32.560 --> 48:36.079
Technically. You should've
come to me the first time.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.399
You wanted teachers
to be self-sufficient.

48:38.400 --> 48:43.799
Not with something as serious as
this. Context, Linda! OK. Mea culpa.

48:43.800 --> 48:46.319
I shouldn't have
stuck my size fours in.

48:46.320 --> 48:49.479
But at least Em and her mum
are talking. That's something, right?

48:49.480 --> 48:54.199
OK. INSINCERELY:
It won't happen again, I promise.

48:54.200 --> 48:57.439
Well, every cloud
has a silver lining, I suppose.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.680
I don't understand.

48:58.681 --> 49:03.359
You've saved me a lot
of legwork with Grantly.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.800
Please, don't tell me
you're going to fire them?

49:05.801 --> 49:08.239
You can't! I will not have him
use you as a Trojan horse

49:08.240 --> 49:09.720
to spring his own agenda.

49:09.721 --> 49:11.519
KNOCK AT DOOR
Yes?

49:11.520 --> 49:15.039
Sorry, employment lawyer's
on the phone.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.559
I need to take this.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.199
PHONE RINGS

49:18.200 --> 49:21.279
What on earth happened to you?
It's my job.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.359
You used to lead - inspire.

49:23.360 --> 49:26.639
Not polish your jackboots
on everyone else's backside!

49:26.640 --> 49:29.399
You're out of line! So fire me.
DOOR OPENS

49:29.400 --> 49:33.080
Mr Gibbs again.
He said that he got cut off.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.600
PHONE RINGS

49:43.040 --> 49:44.400
Mr Gibbs.

49:46.520 --> 49:49.439
Sorry, I don't know
what happened either.

49:49.440 --> 49:52.520
Anyway, apologies.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.520
It was a false alarm.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.839
Yes.

50:00.840 --> 50:04.119
I thought Lindsay
didn't want to talk to me.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.599
I thought I'd done something wrong.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.559
Why didn't you just say something?

50:08.560 --> 50:12.439
You hardly spoke two words to me.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.479
But I thought...

50:14.480 --> 50:17.399
All I get from you is a quick hello,
and then you're gone...

50:17.400 --> 50:19.519
upstairs, plugged into the TV.

50:19.520 --> 50:22.159
Even when I'm watching
the same thing downstairs.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.240
Cos you don't want me around.

50:26.320 --> 50:28.120
That's just not true...

50:30.400 --> 50:32.959
Then why didn't you
ever say anything?

50:32.960 --> 50:36.319
Because I didn't want to upset you.

50:36.320 --> 50:39.560
I thought it was your way of coping.

50:41.320 --> 50:43.839
You just carry on.

50:43.840 --> 50:46.879
Dusting, tidying, and...

50:46.880 --> 50:50.319
reorganizing the kitchen cupboards.

50:50.320 --> 50:52.840
Yeah, well, maybe that was mine.

50:56.040 --> 50:57.960
I really miss her.

50:59.080 --> 51:00.760
Me too.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.680
Em...

51:05.680 --> 51:07.839
..I promise,

51:07.840 --> 51:09.679
from the bottom of my heart,

51:09.680 --> 51:12.880
that things are going to be
different from now on.

51:15.120 --> 51:18.400
Trust me.

51:22.240 --> 51:24.120
I'll try.

51:34.920 --> 51:37.400
As you know, I'm well
within my rights to sack you.

51:38.960 --> 51:42.040
But that's not going to happen.

51:43.440 --> 51:47.239
Do I hear the faint footsteps
of a climb-down?

51:47.240 --> 51:53.039
I won't apologise for wanting
to turn this school around.

51:53.040 --> 51:56.519
But I will admit that
I can't do it without you.

51:56.520 --> 52:00.599
Which is why I've asked the site manager
to put the classroom doors back.

52:00.600 --> 52:03.719
And what about Linda?
Linda's a good teacher.

52:03.720 --> 52:08.079
She believes passionately
in what she does.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.639
In fact,
you two have a lot in common.

52:10.640 --> 52:14.600
Then I look forward to forging
a fruitful relationship.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.639
SCHOOL BELL RINGS
Impressive.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.399
Couldn't have done better myself.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.719
Well, you know what they say.

52:25.720 --> 52:28.320
Keep your friends close...

52:34.880 --> 52:36.600
I'll catch you up.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.280
Scout!

52:41.440 --> 52:44.079
I just wanted to say thanks, yeah?

52:44.080 --> 52:45.319
For today.

52:45.320 --> 52:48.520
Who knows what would've happened.
It's all right.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.120
I've got you a present.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.040
It's a friendship bracelet.

52:58.320 --> 53:01.160
Serious? You've been a real mate.

53:04.120 --> 53:05.319
Stuck up cow.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.399
Chav.

53:07.400 --> 53:08.480
See ya.

53:13.080 --> 53:16.960
Come on, everyone. It is for
a good cause. Chalky is one of us.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.120
Have you got any change?

53:22.880 --> 53:26.759
Um, why don't we all go out
for dinner tonight, my treat?

53:26.760 --> 53:30.559
Are you sure your comrades won't mind
you fraternising with the enemy?

53:30.560 --> 53:33.999
Yeah, sorry about that, it was just
a sudden rush of blood to the head.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.839
Go on, I'll even let you
have a bite of my prawn toast.

53:36.840 --> 53:40.439
Meanwhile Zack spends all evening staring
at his shoes? No, no, it's fine.

53:40.440 --> 53:43.599
I fed him some line about me wetting
myself while I was on exercise.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.800
Look, I know, but it was
the first thing that

53:45.801 --> 53:47.999
came into my head.
And it worked, it was great.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.159
Sian, you ready?

53:50.160 --> 53:52.740
These departmental budgets
won't finalise themselves.

53:52.741 --> 53:55.319
I'd completely forgotten.
Me too.

53:55.320 --> 53:58.160
Well, there's no need
for all of us to stay late.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.759
The first round's on me.

54:03.760 --> 54:04.919
I'm sorry.

54:04.920 --> 54:08.359
No, it's fine. I was planning
on seeing Chalky anyway.

54:08.360 --> 54:10.719
So I'll just get a take-away
for me and Zack,

54:10.720 --> 54:13.079
and we'll have a proper
lads' night in. Great.

54:13.080 --> 54:15.079
As promised.

54:15.080 --> 54:19.639
From, "Get Well" to, "Thank You".
Now it's more of a "Forgive Me?"

54:19.640 --> 54:21.079
Apology accepted.

54:21.080 --> 54:23.639
I could do with a drink
after the day I've had.

54:23.640 --> 54:25.439
Sian and I are on the late shift.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.520
Oh. Well, some other time.

54:32.880 --> 54:34.160
Come on then, Linda.

54:34.161 --> 54:37.240
I'll introduce you to the bolt hole.

54:43.600 --> 54:45.079
To Chalky.

54:45.080 --> 54:47.839
Mmm, a true comrade.

54:47.840 --> 54:50.039
Just because I'm deputy head

54:50.040 --> 54:52.399
doesn't mean my heart's
not in the right place.

54:52.400 --> 54:55.959
That's the thing about
climbing the career ladder.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.039
What's that?

54:57.040 --> 54:58.120
You get to the top,

54:58.121 --> 55:01.079
and you realise there's nothing there
but the view.

55:01.080 --> 55:03.479
Budge over. What the...?

55:03.480 --> 55:05.599
Vodka shots - melon flavour.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.080
Trust me, they're good.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.559
Not bad.

55:17.560 --> 55:20.479
See? Try something different,
you might surprise yourself.

55:20.480 --> 55:21.999
Touche.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.439
I'm sorry we got off
on the wrong foot.

55:25.440 --> 55:30.519
You're the cornerstone of the department.
Without you, the whole thing crumbles.

55:30.520 --> 55:34.439
And you, my dear,
are a rose between two thorns.

55:34.440 --> 55:36.480
Excuse me. Nature calls.

55:39.600 --> 55:43.039
Still, you wouldn't
want to cross me twice.

55:43.040 --> 55:46.160
Your round?

55:49.280 --> 55:51.119
I think it all just about adds up.

55:51.120 --> 55:54.799
Whoever invented spreadsheets
was an evil, evil man.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.119
Or woman.

55:57.120 --> 56:00.240
What, everything in boxes?
No, it was definitely a man.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.799
Thanks for sticking with me today.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.959
It's OK. It's what you pay me for.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.640
Night cap? Yeah.

56:13.520 --> 56:15.400
Single malt.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.919
Linda holds a torch for you,
I reckon.

56:19.920 --> 56:22.239
Please...

56:22.240 --> 56:24.000
She's so not my type.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.680
Michael...

56:39.680 --> 56:41.640
I should never have left you.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.839
You know what?

56:45.840 --> 56:48.640
I never really liked whisky.

57:08.800 --> 57:12.439
Look, Ronan, you don't get it.
I'm re-sitting, it's my last chance.

57:12.440 --> 57:16.439
I've been thinking about leaving.
What did Mr Byrne say?

57:16.440 --> 57:20.359
He said I'm 16, I can leave when I want.
Ken Watling, a professional rugby coach.

57:20.360 --> 57:22.479
I get that you want to
do well in your exams,

57:22.480 --> 57:24.679
but can you try and be
a bit nicer sometimes?

57:24.680 --> 57:26.640
That's why I asked Madi to help me...

57:26.641 --> 57:28.780
cos she was interested,
cos she didn't look at

57:28.781 --> 57:30.919
me like I was a loser.
Because she fancies you!

57:30.920 --> 57:32.360
Well, at least someone does!

57:32.361 --> 57:34.740
I want him back in school
by the end of the day.

57:34.741 --> 57:37.119
And don't make me involve
the authorities.

57:37.120 --> 57:40.679
Leave him alone! I don't know what you
heard, but I never touched Vicki!

57:40.680 --> 57:44.120
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't sack you now?
