00:04.838 --> 00:07.741
[theme music]

00:50.084 --> 00:51.485
[laugh]

00:58.526 --> 01:00.961
OK, so is it a boy or a girl?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.830
We've got to wait for
the ring to start moving.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.466
Side to side, it's a boy,
and up and down, it's a girl.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.700
I don't wanna know.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.001
ROSEANNE: Well then, don't look.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.538
Well, only tell
me if it's a girl.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.005
Side to side.

01:12.106 --> 01:12.940
It's a boy.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.509
Oh, I wanted a girl.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.811
Well, you should've
laid the other way.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.683
This is stupid.

01:22.783 --> 01:23.584
Yeah, you're right.

01:23.684 --> 01:24.952
Let's do it the scientific way.

01:25.052 --> 01:28.322
Let me look at your butt.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.857
What are you talking about?

01:29.957 --> 01:31.559
It's a scientific
fact, Jackie.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.894
If it's a flat pancake
butt, it's a girl.

01:33.994 --> 01:37.365
And if it's a big ol'
bubble butt, it's a boy.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.100
Hey, I'm not gonna
show you my butt.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.102
Come on, just do it.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.139
God, Mom, get a life.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.476
We're just trying to figure
out the sex of Crystal's baby.

01:48.576 --> 01:49.477
Who cares?

01:49.577 --> 01:50.678
It's just gonna be
another screaming,

01:50.778 --> 01:53.046
whining, bratty, little
life-sucking poop machine.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.585
You still want her to babysit?

02:00.020 --> 02:01.722
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.458
OK, Crystal, what are
we gonna name this baby?

02:04.558 --> 02:07.928
Well, we have a
tradition in our family.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.898
My grandmother was Ruby,
and my mother was Amber,

02:10.998 --> 02:12.633
and I'm Crystal.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.035
So I was thinking
that this must stop.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.039
Well, whatever
you do, don't give

02:19.139 --> 02:20.808
it some dorky name like Becky.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.643
What's wrong with
your dorky name?

02:22.743 --> 02:24.178
It's like a chicken noise.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.479
It's like, (CLUCKING)
Becky, Beck--

02:25.579 --> 02:27.515
Beck-- Beck-- Becky.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.882
Hey, you're lucky.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.050
It was the '70s.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.221
You could have been
named Frampton or Shibli.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.888
Well, I gotta go.

02:37.858 --> 02:38.659
Help me.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.697
Mom, look.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.099
I ate my Pop-Tart into
the shape of a gun.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.635
Boom boom.

02:47.735 --> 02:51.104
I definitely want a girl.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.873
You better tell
that to your butt.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.142
Oh, Roseanne.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.311
Remember, Lamaze
class tomorrow night.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.812
ROSEANNE: I'll be there.
- Bye.

02:58.912 --> 02:59.713
ROSEANNE: See ya.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.915
Wait, you're her Lamaze coach?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.116
What happened to Ed?

03:03.217 --> 03:05.018
No, I'm just a
backup in case the baby

03:05.118 --> 03:07.421
comes early, or Ed's out
of town or something.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.490
You know, when I have
a baby, I wanna deliver

03:09.590 --> 03:11.058
it in a pool of warm water.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.927
I think that's the gentlest way
to bring a baby into the world.

03:14.027 --> 03:14.928
Yeah?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.697
And I imagine it
keeps the swimmers out

03:16.797 --> 03:17.598
of the shallow end.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.770
I keep telling you, man,
you got hurt, you should sue.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.637
I'm fine, Arnie.

03:23.737 --> 03:24.572
Leave me alone.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.307
You're lucky
you're alive, man.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.608
What happened, Dan?
Are you OK?

03:27.708 --> 03:28.976
Nothing.
No, it's OK.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.110
It's no big deal.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.412
I had a little accident
down at the job site.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.313
Little accident?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.414
You were almost killed.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.315
It was great.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.683
Dan.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.885
OK, OK, I got in the way of
a wrecking ball, but it missed.

03:37.985 --> 03:38.786
[gasp]

03:38.886 --> 03:39.787
Oh, man, that's so lame.

03:39.887 --> 03:40.954
Tell them the good part.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.590
OK, I'll tell them.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.758
OK, so Dan is sitting in
the port-o-johnny, right?

03:44.858 --> 03:45.926
Minding his own business.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.862
And the wrecking ball
comes in and bam!

03:48.962 --> 03:52.065
Knocked that sucker 17 feet.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.033
I measured it.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.034
Did you see a doctor?

03:54.134 --> 03:55.002
Are you OK?

03:55.102 --> 03:56.604
Yeah, it's just
a couple bruises.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.071
Well, it could be
like a concussion.

03:58.171 --> 03:58.972
No, it ain't.

03:59.072 --> 03:59.940
I got a hard head.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.041
Does it hurt, Dad?

04:01.141 --> 04:01.942
No, it's OK.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.711
Get away from there.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.779
More embarrassed
than anything else.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.616
I crawled out of that thing with
my pants down around my ankles.

04:08.716 --> 04:12.686
I looked up, there's 30 people
standing around, staring at me.

04:12.786 --> 04:13.987
Man, it was really
an awkward moment.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.389
No one knew what to do.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.858
Fortunately, I had the presence
of mind to start the applause.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.795
Don't you owe us money?

04:21.895 --> 04:22.696
I gotta go.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.308
Hey.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.176
Hey.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.578
What are you eating?

04:37.678 --> 04:38.746
Salami and peppers.

04:38.846 --> 04:39.947
What?

04:40.047 --> 04:43.317
One brush with death a
day isn't enough for you?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.885
I live on the edge.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.887
You want a bite?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.657
Wuss.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.191
What are you doing up?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.862
I couldn't sleep, so I
thought I'd go over some bills.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.997
Maybe what happened
today is keeping you awake.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.332
Nah.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.434
You weren't, like, worried
that something more serious

05:00.534 --> 05:01.335
could happen?

05:01.435 --> 05:03.704
Nope.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.972
So that's our will there, huh?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.977
OK, I was curious
about what might

05:10.077 --> 05:13.414
happen to my wife and family
if I hadn't had been so lucky.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.448
Oh, come on, Dan.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.617
It's the middle of the night.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.152
Honey, I think we
should talk about this.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.689
I mean, what would happen if
we both went at the same time,

05:21.789 --> 05:23.857
like in a plane crash?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.994
We never go anywhere, Dan.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.397
A plane would actually have
to crash into the sofa.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.738
Honey, we haven't changed
this will in 16 years.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.207
Darlene and DJ
aren't even in here.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.143
We left Becky to Ziggy.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.912
Well, he was the
most responsible person

05:45.012 --> 05:46.780
we knew at the time.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.182
He had his own Texaco card.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.420
What were we thinking?

05:52.520 --> 05:55.523
We were thinking
anybody but our parents.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.391
Come on, let's go to bed now.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.026
Honey, how can you
go to sleep knowing

05:59.126 --> 06:00.394
the kids aren't taken care of?

06:00.494 --> 06:01.495
What?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.196
Like they are taken care
of when we're awake?

06:06.099 --> 06:07.200
Come on, Dan, I'm tired.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.836
I really think we
should deal with this.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.740
All right.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.208
We'll decide who gets the kids.

06:15.308 --> 06:18.278
Now-- who do we really hate?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.856
What'd we get up to?

06:28.956 --> 06:30.223
Oh, man.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.159
Do you still want
to be cremated?

06:32.259 --> 06:33.927
Yeah.

06:34.027 --> 06:37.230
Not right now.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.767
You know, because it is
pretty complicated, you know.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.335
First, I gotta find the urn,
then I gotta find the matches.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.741
I was hoping you'd die on a
Thursday when it's trash day.

06:50.444 --> 06:54.081
I'll try to expire
near the curb, dear.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.584
You know, Dan,
when I die, I don't

06:56.684 --> 06:58.686
want you to have one of these
funerals where everybody cries,

06:58.786 --> 06:59.720
you know.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.189
I want you to throw
a great big party.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.090
Oh, we will, dear.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.328
Morning.
DAN: Hey.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.597
ROSEANNE: Hey, girls.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.799
So did you decide which
one of us inherits this dump?

07:11.899 --> 07:12.700
What?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.568
Were you eavesdropping?

07:14.668 --> 07:16.937
You've been yakking
about it all night.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.872
And face it, Mom, you've
got one of those voices

07:18.972 --> 07:19.773
that can bend steel.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.978
Yeah, well, we decided
that when we die,

07:25.078 --> 07:26.614
we're dividing
everything equally

07:26.714 --> 07:28.181
between the three of you.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.082
I just want the cash.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.221
It has sentimental value.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.093
Don't drink out
of the milk carton.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.863
[panting]

07:42.963 --> 07:45.165
What are you doing up so early?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.568
I started jogging again.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.670
I ran all the way over here.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.138
ROSEANNE: Good for you.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.172
Yeah.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.541
I'm just gonna rest
here for a second,

07:53.641 --> 07:57.477
and then you can
drive me back home.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.912
I'm on my way to work.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.147
You want me to give you a lift?

08:00.247 --> 08:03.116
No, I'm gonna get
some breakfast first.

08:03.216 --> 08:07.187
It is the most important
mooch of the day.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.088
You be careful.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.927
You got any oat bran,
or shredded wheat, or--

08:14.027 --> 08:15.128
oh, Cocoa Puffs.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.833
Well, I'm outta here too.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.569
Bye.
- Bye.

08:21.669 --> 08:22.469
Don't die.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.470
I'll do my best.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.739
What's that?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.608
Your will?

08:27.708 --> 08:30.544
Yeah, we were up all night
trying to figure out who's

08:30.644 --> 08:31.712
gonna get the kids if we die.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.614
Oh, that's gotta be fun.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.148
Yeah, well, don't worry.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.183
You're off the hook.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.384
Huh?

08:37.484 --> 08:38.786
DJ took my keys and
locked himself in my truck.

08:38.886 --> 08:39.687
Can I use yours?

08:39.787 --> 08:41.154
Yeah, they're in my purse.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.756
What the hell did
he do that for?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.057
He doesn't want
me to go to work.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.793
I'll be killed.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.960
Oh, man.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.495
Don't worry.
I'll drive him to school.

08:48.596 --> 08:49.396
I'll talk to him.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.764
He'll be fine.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.100
What did that mean,
I'm off the hook?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.702
Oh, yeah.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.771
We decided we'll leave the
kids with Crystal and Ed.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.741
Why don't I get the kids?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.209
You get the washer and dryer.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.911
We didn't want
to separate them.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.014
No, I'm serious.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.149
I'm closer to those
kids than anybody.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.919
Yeah, I know, but you
know, you're a single woman.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.122
Well, a lot of single
women raise families.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.958
Yeah, I know, but you
know, they do it from,

09:18.058 --> 09:20.427
like, the time that
they're babies.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.562
Roseanne, I have
been there since day

09:22.663 --> 09:24.464
one, since they were babies.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.867
You're just trying to
tell me I couldn't do it.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.803
No, we just didn't
want to burden you.

09:29.903 --> 09:35.008
Which is a really nice way
of saying you don't trust me.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.476
Hey.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.145
You'll thank me when I'm dead.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.124
Jack.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.559
King.

09:52.660 --> 09:53.794
OK, you win.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.328
Let's play again.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.564
Don't you have some
homework to do or something?

09:57.665 --> 09:59.232
I wanna stay with you.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.133
OK.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.601
You getting hungry?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.303
Yeah.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.338
I guess I oughta
get dinner started.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.075
Becky?
7.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.276
7.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.044
BOTH: War.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.746
Yeah, Dad?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.481
Do you know where Mom
put that casserole we're

10:14.581 --> 10:15.415
supposed to have for dinner?

10:15.515 --> 10:17.517
Yeah, it's in
the refrigerator.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.418
I looked.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.820
I couldn't find it in there.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.896
Jeez, it's right here.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.463
I guess I'll put
it in the microwave.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.299
OK.

10:32.399 --> 10:36.103
Hey, um-- could you
hand me the aluminum foil?

10:36.203 --> 10:37.671
What for?

10:37.771 --> 10:39.973
You're supposed to keep
it covered, aren't you?

10:40.073 --> 10:44.077
Dad, you can't put
metal in the microwave.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.014
I was just gonna use a little.

10:47.114 --> 10:47.915
Just forget it.

10:48.015 --> 10:48.949
I'll do it.

10:49.049 --> 10:49.817
Thanks, honey.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.690
- What are you guys doing?
- Fixing dinner.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.925
Just getting ready
to set the table.

10:58.025 --> 11:01.161
Oh, do you know where
Mom keeps her forks?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.296
Do you think I'm dumb enough
to fall for that stupid move?

11:03.396 --> 11:05.032
Hey!

11:05.132 --> 11:08.001
Don't call him stupid.
- I didn't.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.002
Yes, you did.

11:09.102 --> 11:09.903
Shut up.

11:10.003 --> 11:10.938
You shut up, Darlene!

11:11.038 --> 11:11.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:11.939 --> 11:12.940
Hold on, killer.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.808
DJ, I'll tell you what,
why don't you go up

11:14.908 --> 11:16.643
and get washed up for dinner?

11:16.744 --> 11:17.610
OK, Dad.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.047
I'll be right back.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.048
[thud]

11:23.116 --> 11:24.517
What was that?

11:24.617 --> 11:26.319
He's been like that
ever since I got home.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.655
He won't let me
out of his sight.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.157
Dad, he's crazy.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.325
He's showing
concern, which is more

11:32.425 --> 11:34.995
than I can say for certain
others in this household,

11:35.095 --> 11:37.831
considering what
happened to me yesterday.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.266
You were sitting in
a port-o-crapper that

11:39.366 --> 11:42.469
got nailed by a wrecking ball.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.604
I didn't take one shot.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.739
Now that is love.

11:50.010 --> 11:50.878
I'm sorry.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.046
Thank you, dear.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.948
Oh, right, suck up
for the inheritance.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.858
OK, in through the nose,
abdomen, chest, shoulders.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.326
Fill up with air.
Exhale.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.328
Just think of letting go.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.897
Keep the breathing moving.

12:09.997 --> 12:13.433
Coaches, help mom relax.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.735
You know, so anyway,
then Jackie gets all bent

12:15.836 --> 12:16.970
out of shape, you know?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.506
Like, trying to make
me feel all guilty.

12:19.606 --> 12:23.110
Well, she can't take care
of three kids, you know.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.677
I mean, have you
ever seen her fridge?

12:24.778 --> 12:28.849
She's got, like, one egg
and a can of margarita mix.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.986
Coaches, a little word
of encouragement for mom.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.088
That a girl, Crystal.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.991
OK, let's take a
little timeout here.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.527
I'm sure a lot of you have
been thinking of questions

12:40.627 --> 12:42.662
since the last class.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.931
Anybody?

12:44.031 --> 12:46.834
Yeah, this is my first
baby, and I was wondering how

12:46.934 --> 12:48.969
long it takes to push it out.

12:49.069 --> 12:49.870
18 years.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.771
[laugh]

12:54.241 --> 12:56.309
I take it you've got kids.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.945
Yeah, two or three.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.547
Well, did you use
natural childbirth?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.983
Well.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.317
Kind of.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.320
But actually, there's a story
that goes along with this.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.123
OK, get off me, Crystal.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.593
Oh, no, Roseanne, you're
not gonna scare them, are you?

13:13.693 --> 13:16.329
Oh, we'll see what I say.

13:16.429 --> 13:21.168
OK, well, now my first kid,
they just knocked me out,

13:21.268 --> 13:23.170
so I didn't feel anything, and
then they handed me the baby,

13:23.270 --> 13:24.938
you know?
And she's 16 now.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.073
She's blond and thin.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.843
I don't even think
she's really mine.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.845
Anyway, then when
I had my third kid,

13:31.945 --> 13:34.414
OK, I hadn't lost any of the
weight from my second kid

13:34.514 --> 13:36.716
and, OK, from my
first kid either.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.719
And so they were
trying to give me

13:39.819 --> 13:41.922
this local deal and everything.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.656
But I kept on
feeling all the pain,

13:43.756 --> 13:46.159
and so I keep on begging for
more drugs and more drugs,

13:46.259 --> 13:47.594
until finally, the
doctor comes over there.

13:47.694 --> 13:50.163
And he goes, I'm sorry,
Mrs. Conner, he goes,

13:50.263 --> 13:51.899
but if we give you
any more drugs,

13:51.999 --> 13:53.200
it's gonna kill your baby.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.334
[gasp]

13:54.434 --> 13:56.303
So, you know, I thought
about it for a while.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.909
Then I said, OK, no drugs,
but just hit me in the head

14:02.009 --> 14:03.977
with a sledgehammer, would you?

14:04.077 --> 14:07.714
Of course he wouldn't, and so I
end up feeling the whole thing.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.149
Was your husband there?

14:09.249 --> 14:11.018
Oh, yeah, he had
taken the classes,

14:11.118 --> 14:12.719
so they had to let him in.

14:12.819 --> 14:17.024
But all in all, I guess I
was pretty glad he was there.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.026
Oh, god, this is all your idea.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.027
I hate you!

14:20.127 --> 14:21.995
I know.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.097
Oh, god, it hurts.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.899
Breathe.
[breathing]

14:25.999 --> 14:28.135
That helped me before, but
it's not helping me now, Dan.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.369
That's because
you're not doing it.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.303
Come on, honey, breathe.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.204
How's she doing?

14:31.304 --> 14:32.639
She doing OK?

14:32.739 --> 14:34.274
Contractions are
a minute apart.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.575
And she's at 8 centimeters.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.044
8 centimeters!

14:37.144 --> 14:38.111
Hear that, Roseanne?

14:38.211 --> 14:39.646
Way to dilate.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.582
Oh, god, you're such an idiot.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.783
Is your mouth dry, Rosy?

14:43.883 --> 14:44.684
Yes.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.453
You want a Tab?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.988
Get her out of here.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.589
Jackie, why don't
you go get some ice?

14:49.689 --> 14:50.490
OK.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.494
I'm sorry I'm being
so mean to you, Dan.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.862
You're not, honey.

14:55.963 --> 14:56.896
You're being mean to Jackie.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.699
That's why I brought her.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.568
I can't stand it no more, Dan.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.003
I gotta push.
- No, no, no.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.004
Not till the doctor gets here.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.172
Now come on, blow.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.974
[breathing]

15:07.074 --> 15:08.608
OK, OK, it passed.

15:08.708 --> 15:09.509
You're pushing.

15:09.609 --> 15:10.410
(STRAINING) No, I'm not.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.045
Yes, you are.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.147
Now, dammit, if you're
not gonna do this right,

15:14.247 --> 15:15.448
let's forget the whole thing.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.750
Oh, right, we'll just go home.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.853
God, you're such a moron.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.789
Oh, god, this is horrible.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.724
What's happening to me?

15:24.824 --> 15:26.326
Well, either
you're having a baby,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.028
or you just ate
the hospital food.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.798
Oh, god, no, not
a funny doctor.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.866
Just a little
more now, Roseanne.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.069
Get this thing outta me!

15:36.169 --> 15:37.770
OK, we got a head here.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.472
Just one, right?

15:39.572 --> 15:40.907
Keep pushing, Roseanne.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.342
I can't.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.711
I can't.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.079
I can't do any more.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.114
Yes, you can.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.217
Come on, just one
more good hard push.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.253
Jackie, Mom was right--

15:53.353 --> 15:56.589
sex is bad!

15:56.689 --> 15:59.592
[baby crying]

16:00.693 --> 16:01.594
What is it?

16:01.694 --> 16:04.097
What is it?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.565
5, 5, 5, 5--

16:05.665 --> 16:06.466
1.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.600
Yes!
It's a boy!

16:12.172 --> 16:14.541
Let me see him,
let me see him.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.344
Oh, they're cleaning
him off right now.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.479
Oh, Jackie, I'm so
good you were here.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.448
I wanna apologize for
being mean to you.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.949
No, that's all right.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.184
This is so great.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.753
I'm here at the
beginning of a new life.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.556
That's why you've
gotta be the godmother.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.192
I don't know what to say.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.327
Say the same thing you
said when I asked you to be

16:34.427 --> 16:35.862
Becky and Darlene's godmother.

16:35.962 --> 16:36.963
Oh, OK.

16:37.064 --> 16:37.964
OK.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.766
Ladies and gentlemen,
men, men, men,

16:39.866 --> 16:42.402
the starting quarterback, back,
back, for the Chicago Bears,

16:42.502 --> 16:45.372
ars, ars, ars, Dan
Conner's boy, oy, oy.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.340
Just give me the baby.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.309
Oh.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.644
He's beautiful, Dan.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.380
Just like you, honey.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.184
Oh, hello there, little baby.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.985
You tried to kill
me, didn't you?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.292
Oh, look at him,
Dan, he's smiling.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.233
[door opening]

17:43.163 --> 17:46.099
I'm up.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.167
It's late.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.635
I can't sleep.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.103
Why not?

17:50.203 --> 17:52.972
I'm thinking too much.

17:53.072 --> 17:53.873
Buddy.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.146
I've already told you.

17:59.246 --> 18:03.116
You don't have to worry about me
dying 'cause I'm not going to.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.517
You almost did.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.688
I didn't, and I'm not planning
on dying for a long time, OK?

18:08.788 --> 18:11.558
OK.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.393
Go to sleep.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.861
Good night.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.330
Good night.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.832
But you could.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.002
DJ, if you spend all your time
worrying about dying, living

18:23.102 --> 18:26.005
isn't gonna be much fun, is it?

18:26.105 --> 18:29.642
Well, how do I stop worrying?

18:29.742 --> 18:33.045
Well, I try to think
about good stuff,

18:33.146 --> 18:34.847
like watching you
grow up, teaching

18:34.947 --> 18:39.386
you how to drive a car, meeting
the girl you're gonna marry.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.088
I don't like girls.

18:42.189 --> 18:42.989
Yeah, you do.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.056
See?

18:44.157 --> 18:45.325
I still got a lot of
stuff to teach you.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.727
Now good night.

18:47.827 --> 18:48.728
OK.

18:48.828 --> 18:49.729
OK.

18:49.829 --> 18:50.630
Dad.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.768
When's Darlene gonna die?

18:55.868 --> 18:58.638
Good night, DJ.

18:58.738 --> 18:59.572
See you in the morning.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.473
DAN: You got it.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.714
Hey.
- Hey.

19:07.814 --> 19:08.715
How was baby class?

19:08.815 --> 19:11.050
Oh, you know, same as always.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.521
[breathing]

19:18.090 --> 19:20.927
You know, I was thinking
about this guardian stuff,

19:21.027 --> 19:23.730
and I was thinking, well,
maybe we should leave

19:23.830 --> 19:25.898
the kids with Jackie after all.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.067
Roseanne, we've
been through this.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.670
Yeah, but I mean, she's
part of their lives, Dan.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.871
OK.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.740
She knows when Becky's lying.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.309
She knows when Darlene's
sucking up just to get money.

19:36.409 --> 19:40.580
And she understands all of
DJ's weird little chatter.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.782
Are you feeling
a little guilty?

19:42.882 --> 19:44.083
Yeah, I guess so.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.918
Aren't you?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.087
Yeah, I guess.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.758
OK, if she wants
them, she can have them.

19:51.858 --> 19:52.859
Thanks.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.093
OK.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.928
You go wake them up, and
I'll drive them over there.

19:58.798 --> 19:59.699
Let's go to bed.

19:59.799 --> 20:03.002
All right.
Oh, man.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.772
You know, Dan, you need to
get more life insurance.

20:05.872 --> 20:06.906
We've got enough.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.275
No, we don't.

20:08.375 --> 20:12.712
Like, if you ever die, you know,
I want to grieve in Tahiti.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.615
[theme music]

20:23.423 --> 20:25.558
OK, me and Dan are dead.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.726
You've moved into the house now.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.528
You are in charge of the kids.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.462
Now question number one.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.430
Shoot.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.899
It's Saturday
night, it's 2:00 AM,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.367
and Becky's not home
from her date yet.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.536
What do you do?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.638
OK.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.972
Um.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.608
Am I home from my date yet?

20:41.708 --> 20:44.477
Where am I?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.145
You don't have a date, Jackie.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.314
You have three kids.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.448
You will never have a date.

20:48.548 --> 20:49.716
You will never have a life.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.352
Right, no date,
no life, I forgot.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.520
OK.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.621
OK.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.757
Um, I would call up
all of Becky's friends.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.392
Wrong.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.395
This is that 911
question, isn't it?

21:02.495 --> 21:03.930
- Wrong.
- OK, what?

21:04.030 --> 21:05.097
I don't know.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.766
Well, you go up
in Darlene's room,

21:06.866 --> 21:08.868
and you threaten Darlene's life
until she tells you where--

21:08.968 --> 21:10.002
Threaten Darlene's life.

21:10.102 --> 21:10.970
I should've know that.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.038
I should've had that one.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.239
OK.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.140
OK.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.475
All right, next question.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.910
Becky and Darlene have been
fighting like cats and dogs

21:18.010 --> 21:20.279
for two weeks.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.247
So?

21:21.348 --> 21:22.148
Right.

21:22.248 --> 21:24.551
JACKIE: Yeah.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.818
OK, next question.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.554
You are so exhausted
from taking care

21:27.654 --> 21:30.423
of three kids and the house
that you are not in the mood

21:30.523 --> 21:33.360
for sex for three whole months.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.495
What do you do?

21:35.595 --> 21:38.130
Maybe you oughta give
the kids to Crystal and Ed.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.732
No, it's too late now.

21:39.832 --> 21:40.767
No, no, no.

21:40.867 --> 21:41.901
No, you wanted it.

21:42.001 --> 21:42.802
No.

21:42.902 --> 21:43.703
You begged--

21:43.803 --> 21:45.572
No, no.
