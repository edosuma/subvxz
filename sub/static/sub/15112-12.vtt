00:01.189 --> 00:02.480
<i>Previously, on "Awake"...</i>

00:02.979 --> 00:06.341
When I woke up I realized
that I hadn't gone back at all.

00:06.461 --> 00:08.381
- And that's never happened before.
- No.

00:08.630 --> 00:11.177
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would it suddenly stop now?

00:11.297 --> 00:12.438
Why am I seeing you?
I don't know.

00:12.473 --> 00:14.440
Why can't I get back to Rex?
I don't know.

00:14.458 --> 00:16.459
Could you just leave me alone
for a few minutes?

00:16.493 --> 00:18.211
How can I leave you alone
if I'm you?

00:18.245 --> 00:19.629
<i>How do I explain</i>

00:19.663 --> 00:21.464
<i>that one of my officers</i>
<i>ran through traffic</i>

00:21.498 --> 00:23.499
<i>and then ran away</i>
<i>from the scene</i>

00:23.550 --> 00:24.717
<i>of the resulting accidents?</i>

00:24.752 --> 00:27.670
I'm sorry. They're going
to hand down a suspension

00:27.721 --> 00:30.139
pending a full investigation
into your actions.

00:41.318 --> 00:42.819
Dad!

00:42.853 --> 00:44.020
Rex!

00:44.071 --> 00:44.970
What is it?

00:44.988 --> 00:46.405
There was no accident.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.324
That's what I had to understand.

00:48.358 --> 00:50.059
They were trying to kill me.

00:52.496 --> 00:55.531
<i>So seeing Detective
Hawkins at this carnival</i>

00:55.582 --> 00:58.167
triggered memories of something

00:58.202 --> 01:00.837
<i>that you have been unwilling</i>
<i>or unable to remember:</i>

01:00.871 --> 01:03.706
<i>The accident itself.</i>

01:04.675 --> 01:10.296
So to understand these memories
<i>you present them to yourself</i>

01:10.330 --> 01:12.548
in a language that
you've become familiar with:

01:12.599 --> 01:16.519
<i>The language</i>
<i>of this ongoing dream.</i>

01:16.553 --> 01:17.770
You're missing the point.

01:17.805 --> 01:21.941
Dr. Evans, what-what I had
to force myself to remember,

01:21.975 --> 01:25.978
what I had to find...
there before I could come back to here

01:26.012 --> 01:28.948
was that it wasn't an accident,

01:28.982 --> 01:31.484
<i>that this Hawkins</i>
<i>ran me off the road,</i>

01:31.518 --> 01:34.453
that he was trying to kill me.

01:34.488 --> 01:36.739
Have you found any evidence
that he tried to kill you?

01:36.790 --> 01:38.524
I'm still looking.

01:38.542 --> 01:39.792
Don't you see?

01:39.827 --> 01:41.694
That's why I couldn't
wake up there.

01:41.712 --> 01:44.630
I had to stay here
until I remembered.

01:44.665 --> 01:48.668
Is it possible <i>that you're not
actually remembering this,</i>

01:48.702 --> 01:50.803
<i>but inventing it?</i>

01:50.838 --> 01:52.972
No. It isn't.

01:53.006 --> 01:54.891
Are you sure?

01:54.925 --> 01:58.678
Accepting the responsibility for
the accident that killed your son

01:58.712 --> 02:03.015
<i>might be so unbearable that
you created a scapegoat.</i>

02:04.384 --> 02:08.220
<i>Seeing Detective Hawkins
at the carnival led you</i>

02:08.238 --> 02:11.657
<i>to the memory that he was</i>
<i>on the scene that night,</i>

02:11.692 --> 02:17.780
<i>that he was helping you,</i> but your mind
twisted and distorted that memory

02:17.831 --> 02:22.535
to help you cope...
...creating a paranoid delusion

02:22.569 --> 02:24.754
that you believe
that he ran you off the road.

02:24.788 --> 02:26.789
It's not what I believe.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.624
It's what I saw.

02:28.675 --> 02:30.176
It's what happened.

02:30.210 --> 02:35.965
Except that there's no evidence
to support your theory, is there?

02:36.016 --> 02:38.267
I'll find the evidence.

02:38.302 --> 02:42.805
<i>In your memory,</i> you saw
Detective Hawkins before he hit you.

02:42.839 --> 02:44.407
As he hit me.

02:44.441 --> 02:45.691
How did you see him?

02:45.726 --> 02:47.276
In the mirror.

02:47.311 --> 02:48.895
Your side mirror?

02:48.929 --> 02:50.179
Yeah.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.565
Has it been your experience
that you can see faces

02:52.599 --> 02:55.434
of the people driving
the car behind you...

02:55.452 --> 02:57.536
<i>He switched his lights off</i>
<i>so that I wouldn't see him</i>

02:57.571 --> 02:59.772
when he pulled up alongside me.

02:59.790 --> 03:02.658
So you saw his face in the dark.

03:04.878 --> 03:08.080
Look, doctor, I know what I saw.

03:08.115 --> 03:10.549
I'm sure that it does feel real,
detective,

03:10.584 --> 03:15.638
but our memories are notoriously unreliable,
especially in the face of trauma.

03:15.672 --> 03:17.590
I'm sure that you've dealt
with eyewitnesses

03:17.624 --> 03:19.792
who are certain of what they
saw, only to be proven wrong.

03:19.810 --> 03:23.846
You know the studies of subjects who
defend their memory of an event

03:23.897 --> 03:27.767
even after being shown videotape
evidence to the contrary.

03:27.801 --> 03:29.468
Let me ask you this way:

03:29.486 --> 03:33.906
As a detective, if a witness
were telling you this story,

03:33.941 --> 03:36.108
would you find it credible?

03:36.142 --> 03:37.643
I am a detective.

03:37.661 --> 03:39.161
I know what I saw.

03:39.196 --> 03:41.146
And you're not answering
my question.

03:41.164 --> 03:44.483
Think about a case where
the key piece of evidence,

03:44.501 --> 03:49.505
a piece that everything hinged
on, was one split-second glance

03:49.539 --> 03:52.992
in a mirror in the dark.

03:53.010 --> 03:55.711
Now, do you think that
that's a case you could win?

03:55.762 --> 03:58.597
This isn't a hypothetical case.

03:58.632 --> 04:01.083
This is not a study.

04:01.118 --> 04:03.703
It's not my imagination.

04:03.737 --> 04:10.459
Detective Hawkins ran me off the
road and destroyed my family.

04:10.494 --> 04:12.945
He is the reason we'll never
all be together again.

04:12.980 --> 04:16.983
I'm as sure of that
as I've ever been of anything.

04:20.786 --> 04:22.238
Detective, where are you going?

04:22.289 --> 04:24.373
I should never have called you.

04:24.408 --> 04:25.875
I'm sorry.

04:25.909 --> 04:27.293
I have work to do.

04:38.138 --> 04:39.922
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

04:39.973 --> 04:41.974
<i>I'm awake with my
wife, and I close my eyes,</i>

04:42.009 --> 04:44.376
<i>I open them,</i>
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

04:44.394 --> 04:46.879
And this has been happening
since the accident?

04:49.066 --> 04:51.017
<i>So you begin
working on one case</i>

04:51.051 --> 04:53.319
<i>here in reality,</i>
<i>and then suddenly</i>

04:53.353 --> 04:55.688
<i>you begin working another case</i>
<i>there in your dream.</i>

04:55.722 --> 04:58.741
<i>It all feels
completely real to me.</i>

04:58.775 --> 05:01.911
<i>You can't tell whether you're
awake or asleep</i> at this very moment?

05:01.945 --> 05:04.897
<i>Well, I can assure you,</i> Detective
Britten, this is not a dream.

05:04.915 --> 05:07.516
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

05:17.771 --> 05:19.771
My mom says I can go as long as
I finish my essay.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.465
How far are you?

05:21.499 --> 05:24.568
Just trying to figure out
my conclusion.

05:24.602 --> 05:26.703
It was a good book.
You should read it.

05:26.737 --> 05:29.272
Mr. Clark would never assign
<i>catcher in the rye.</i>

05:29.307 --> 05:31.725
He thinks American literature
peaked <i>Moby dick.</i>

05:33.561 --> 05:35.629
I meant you read
it, like, on your own.

05:35.663 --> 05:36.980
Maybe I will.

05:37.031 --> 05:41.935
Well, I better get back
to it, but assume I'm going.

05:41.953 --> 05:44.270
All right, cool.
It's gonna be perfect beach weather.

05:44.288 --> 05:45.605
Text you when I wake up.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.525
Okay, bye.

05:48.559 --> 05:50.710
Sounds like you and Emma
are getting on well.

05:50.745 --> 05:53.279
Yeah, finally.

05:58.118 --> 06:01.338
Whenever you do that, it usually
means I'm in some kind of trouble.

06:01.389 --> 06:03.640
No, you're not in trouble,
but I-I do need to talk to you

06:03.674 --> 06:06.726
about a, about a case
I'm working on.

06:06.761 --> 06:09.196
A case?

06:09.230 --> 06:11.231
Is that what you've been doing
in the garage?

06:11.265 --> 06:14.151
Yeah.

06:14.185 --> 06:15.735
You've been stuck in there,
like, the last two days.

06:15.770 --> 06:17.404
Why haven't you been working
from the office?

06:17.438 --> 06:19.990
It's complicated.

06:20.024 --> 06:23.743
Look, things are... Might get a little
rough for me over the next few days.

06:23.778 --> 06:26.279
While I'm dealing with it,
I'd rather you weren't around.

06:26.313 --> 06:28.498
Why not?

06:28.533 --> 06:30.667
'Cause I'm going after
a dangerous guy.

06:30.701 --> 06:34.337
Not that he would go after you, but
I'd rather be on the safe side.

06:34.372 --> 06:35.539
What about you?

06:35.590 --> 06:37.040
Oh, I can handle it.

06:37.091 --> 06:40.293
I just don't want to be worrying about
you, so your aunt Carol's been going on

06:40.327 --> 06:42.596
about wanting to spend time
with you up in Visalia.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.264
She's on her way.
She'll pick you up in an hour.

06:44.298 --> 06:47.017
I just made plans to go to the
beach with Emma tomorrow morning.

06:47.051 --> 06:48.885
I know, and I'm sorry, but
you're gonna have to push it.

06:48.936 --> 06:50.503
She already changed
her plans for me once.

06:50.521 --> 06:52.539
I'm not gonna make her change them again.
Rex! Listen to me.

06:52.573 --> 06:54.224
I need you to go
to aunt Carol's.

06:55.810 --> 06:59.629
This guy you're going after...
what did he do?

07:01.716 --> 07:03.767
Doesn't matter.

07:03.801 --> 07:06.152
You're kinda freaking me out.

07:06.186 --> 07:07.186
I'm sorry.

07:07.205 --> 07:08.538
Look, it's all gonna be fine.

07:08.573 --> 07:10.657
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be okay.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.742
I need you to go pack
a bag right now.

07:12.793 --> 07:13.910
All right?

07:13.961 --> 07:15.579
Hey. Hey.

07:15.630 --> 07:16.997
I love you, kid.

07:17.031 --> 07:18.915
I love you, too.

07:24.371 --> 07:26.423
Captain's all over me
to close out the Chapin case.

07:26.474 --> 07:28.341
I need Michael's
follow-up.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.559
He's out sick.

07:29.594 --> 07:30.710
Again?

07:30.728 --> 07:31.895
Call him.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.379
I've been trying him
for two days.

07:33.397 --> 07:34.598
He usually gets back to me.

07:34.649 --> 07:35.882
You try his house?

07:35.900 --> 07:37.234
What do you think?

07:37.268 --> 07:39.886
Okay, I'll do the follow-up.

07:47.862 --> 07:51.081
This is Michael Britten.
Please leave me a message.

07:51.115 --> 07:53.333
Hey, Mike, it's me again.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.502
Uh, this time,
I'm calling from your house.

07:55.536 --> 07:59.289
You know, your car isn't here,
so I'm becoming concerned.

07:59.340 --> 08:01.007
Give me a call
as soon as you can.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.626
All right, bye.

08:35.241 --> 08:37.077
Detective Freeman, come in.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.412
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

08:39.446 --> 08:42.916
Well, you said
that it was important.

08:43.951 --> 08:46.970
I'm concerned about Michael,

08:47.004 --> 08:49.472
and I'm wondering if you can
tell me if I have reasons to be.

08:51.175 --> 08:53.009
Why don't you sit down?

08:56.013 --> 08:58.464
Now you understand
that I am not at liberty

08:58.482 --> 09:00.350
to talk about the work
with my patients.

09:00.401 --> 09:03.803
Unless they present a danger
to themselves or others.

09:03.821 --> 09:08.692
In that case, the law compels
you to tell the police.

09:08.743 --> 09:14.447
How much do you know about why
Detective Britten started seeing me?

09:14.481 --> 09:16.499
Well, Mike has some memory
issues after the accident.

09:16.534 --> 09:19.753
Got into a couple
of temper flare-ups.

09:19.787 --> 09:22.539
Captain said he needed to see a shrink
if he wanted to stay on the force.

09:22.590 --> 09:27.260
Then you realize that if I share
any doubts about Detective Britten

09:27.294 --> 09:31.881
with captain Harper, it
would end his career.

09:31.932 --> 09:34.768
I'm not captain Harper.

09:38.839 --> 09:43.026
Maybe if you could-could be more
specific about your concerns.

09:44.511 --> 09:47.346
Okay, Mike's been out sick
the last couple of days.

09:47.365 --> 09:50.066
I been trying to call him.
He hasn't returned my calls.

09:50.117 --> 09:52.285
Uh, I went to the house;
He wasn't there.

09:52.319 --> 09:55.622
I'm looking around;
Then I go into his garage,

09:55.656 --> 09:58.658
and he has this collection
of police reports, photos.

09:58.692 --> 10:01.461
I mean, everything
surrounding his accident,

10:01.495 --> 10:04.464
and then he has this
whole other bunch of files

10:04.498 --> 10:10.670
about some... Detective ed Hawkins
from the Western division.

10:10.704 --> 10:13.807
I mean, case work,
personal information.

10:15.676 --> 10:22.265
Now, look, if there's something that
I should know, you need to tell me.

10:25.736 --> 10:28.488
You're putting me
in an impossible position.

10:28.522 --> 10:32.492
If I have something to worry
about, I want to know.

10:34.462 --> 10:38.665
The fact that you're here right
now answers your question.

10:40.067 --> 10:44.287
So if you're considering
<i>some kind of intervention,</i>

10:44.338 --> 10:47.424
<i>you might want to do it</i>
<i>sooner than later.</i>

11:18.249 --> 11:20.417
Put your hands up now.

11:20.435 --> 11:21.551
Britten...

11:22.887 --> 11:24.438
What's going on?

11:24.472 --> 11:27.257
That's what
you're gonna tell me.

11:27.275 --> 11:30.593
Look, I'm sorry,
but I'm a bit confused.

11:30.611 --> 11:32.095
Why don't we skip the part

11:32.113 --> 11:34.781
where you pretend you don't
know what I'm doing here.

11:34.816 --> 11:38.318
You murdered my family, you son of
a bitch, and I want to know why.

11:38.369 --> 11:41.104
We all know you've been
having some issues.

11:43.791 --> 11:45.659
I have your attention now?

11:49.130 --> 11:50.881
You need to get me
to the hospital, Britten.

11:50.915 --> 11:52.716
Here's what I'm gonna do next.

11:52.750 --> 11:55.452
I'm gonna shoot your knees out.
Then you'll never walk again.

11:55.503 --> 11:57.387
Don't! Please!

11:57.422 --> 12:02.809
Three, two, one...
It was Westfield!

12:02.844 --> 12:05.312
The Westfield case, Michael.

12:05.346 --> 12:07.130
<i>It all starts with Westfield.</i>

12:08.349 --> 12:10.684
Westfield?

12:10.735 --> 12:12.235
I never found anything
at Westfield.

12:12.270 --> 12:14.137
Heroin.

12:14.155 --> 12:17.407
We've been taking evidence the
narcotics division confiscated

12:17.442 --> 12:19.326
and selling it off ourselves.

12:20.695 --> 12:24.498
Kept it at Westfield,
until you started asking around.

12:24.532 --> 12:27.417
Then we had to move our shipment
and sit on it.

12:27.452 --> 12:29.536
That's when they decided
you had to go.

12:30.588 --> 12:31.538
Who's "they"?

12:31.589 --> 12:32.672
I just did what I was told.

12:32.707 --> 12:33.840
I had nothing to do with this.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.258
Who?!
They will kill me!

12:37.128 --> 12:38.962
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch.

12:38.996 --> 12:40.347
Who is "they"?

12:41.716 --> 12:43.050
Take me to the hospital.

12:43.101 --> 12:46.720
Call IA, get me protection,
I will tell you everything.

12:47.939 --> 12:51.841
So you can go back to saying you
don't know what I'm talking about?

12:51.859 --> 12:53.176
I swear, I won't.

12:53.194 --> 12:54.361
I have evidence.

12:54.395 --> 12:55.679
Where?

12:55.713 --> 12:57.064
My laptop... it's on the table.

12:57.115 --> 12:58.348
There's a file in it.

12:58.366 --> 12:59.900
There's a file.

13:07.158 --> 13:09.526
What's the file called?

13:09.544 --> 13:11.962
"Lease agreement."
It's in the "records" folder.

13:14.982 --> 13:16.800
Password?

13:16.834 --> 13:19.469
How do I know you won't kill me?

13:19.504 --> 13:20.703
You don't.

13:54.839 --> 13:56.923
Bird.

13:56.958 --> 13:59.593
What the hell are you doing?

13:59.627 --> 14:01.428
He came after me.

14:01.462 --> 14:03.296
But this is his house.

14:03.347 --> 14:06.016
I'm telling you,
I had no choice.

14:06.050 --> 14:09.186
I know what you've been doing.

14:09.220 --> 14:10.587
I saw the garage.

14:10.605 --> 14:11.921
Talked to Dr. Evans.

14:11.939 --> 14:15.258
I'll explain everything.

14:15.276 --> 14:17.277
But first,
you got to give me your gun.

14:17.311 --> 14:19.762
Michael... Bird.

14:19.780 --> 14:21.114
I'm not asking, I'm telling you.

14:21.149 --> 14:22.449
Give me your gun.

14:22.483 --> 14:24.568
Or what?

14:24.602 --> 14:26.436
You gonna shoot me, too?

14:35.329 --> 14:36.913
Michael, we can figure this out.

14:36.947 --> 14:39.966
We can go back to the station, and
you can tell me what happened.

14:40.001 --> 14:42.219
I'm not going in without proof;
I just shot a cop.

14:42.253 --> 14:43.220
Proof of what?

14:43.254 --> 14:46.456
Hawkins and his partners were
running drugs out of Westfield.

14:46.474 --> 14:48.625
That's why they
tried to kill me.

14:48.643 --> 14:50.560
Hey, he just admitted it to me.

14:50.595 --> 14:52.679
You broke into the man's house
with a gun.

14:52.730 --> 14:54.681
He'd have told you
whatever you wanted to hear.

14:54.732 --> 14:56.683
I have evidence on his laptop.

14:56.734 --> 14:57.684
There's a locked file.

14:57.735 --> 14:58.935
I don't have the password.

14:58.969 --> 15:00.637
Okay, then we still need
to go to the station

15:00.655 --> 15:02.472
and have the techs
take a look at it for you.

15:02.490 --> 15:04.641
I don't know
who else is in on this.

15:04.659 --> 15:06.743
That thing gets into
the wrong hands, forget it.

15:06.777 --> 15:08.028
Okay, so what's your plan?

15:08.079 --> 15:09.779
I'm gonna find someone
to unlock the file.

15:09.813 --> 15:10.997
Who?
I don't know!

15:11.032 --> 15:13.033
All right?

15:13.084 --> 15:15.835
What if you're wrong?

15:15.870 --> 15:17.704
I'm not wrong.

15:17.755 --> 15:19.539
What if you go into this file
and don't find what

15:19.590 --> 15:20.840
you're looking for...
I'm not wrong!

15:20.875 --> 15:22.876
Will you then go into
the station with me?

15:28.849 --> 15:32.102
You remember that weird dude
from Angelino Heights?

15:32.136 --> 15:34.521
Uh, Francis... whatever.

15:34.555 --> 15:36.856
You know, he helped us
with the identity theft thing.

15:36.891 --> 15:38.225
The kid who left Google?

15:38.276 --> 15:39.392
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:39.443 --> 15:41.444
Well, I have his number
in my phone.

15:41.479 --> 15:44.514
Call him.

15:44.532 --> 15:46.683
Really?

15:50.404 --> 15:51.521
Where's your phone?

15:51.539 --> 15:53.123
Right pocket.

15:57.495 --> 15:59.496
Ting)

16:10.424 --> 16:11.841
Where you going?

16:11.875 --> 16:14.728
Uh, I just, uh, I got
something I got to do.

16:14.762 --> 16:15.878
What do you have to do?

16:15.896 --> 16:21.050
Uh, it's a-a case
I got to close up.

16:21.068 --> 16:22.218
Michael, you're suspended.

16:22.236 --> 16:24.104
Why don't you just
take some time off?

16:24.155 --> 16:26.389
Where's my gun?

16:26.407 --> 16:28.074
You turned it in.

16:28.109 --> 16:30.226
The one from the closet.

16:30.244 --> 16:34.397
Michael, you-you haven't been
yourself these past few days,

16:34.415 --> 16:38.568
and I got worried,
so... I moved it.

16:41.956 --> 16:44.424
What do you need
a gun for, Michael?

16:47.928 --> 16:48.911
I don't.

16:48.929 --> 16:51.247
Listen... can you
do me a favor?

16:51.265 --> 16:53.249
Can you stay
out of the house today?

16:53.267 --> 16:54.851
Call me before you come back.

16:54.885 --> 16:56.686
You're scaring me.

16:56.721 --> 16:58.722
What's going on?

17:00.858 --> 17:03.193
I'll call you.

17:34.141 --> 17:35.558
Hey, what's up?

17:35.593 --> 17:36.793
Are you alone?

17:36.827 --> 17:40.146
Hey, give me a sec.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.768
Hey, sorry, man.
I was meaning to call you.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.820
I heard Harper put you on leave.

17:46.854 --> 17:47.821
Yeah.

17:47.855 --> 17:49.489
Listen, I need you to meet me.

17:49.523 --> 17:50.607
When?

17:50.641 --> 17:51.608
Right now.

17:51.642 --> 17:54.477
Now? Look, I got to go
interview a witness downtown.

17:54.495 --> 17:56.145
Now, Bird.

17:56.163 --> 17:57.447
Okay.

17:57.481 --> 18:00.483
Well, I guess I can get Hawkins
to cover for me, so...

18:00.501 --> 18:04.087
No, no. You can't tell anyone you're
meeting me, especially Hawkins.

18:04.121 --> 18:05.171
Why?

18:05.206 --> 18:07.006
I'll explain it to you
when I see you.

18:07.041 --> 18:08.324
The park on Sixth and Curson.

18:08.342 --> 18:09.325
Hot dog stand?

18:09.343 --> 18:10.326
Yeah.

18:10.344 --> 18:11.594
On my way.

18:11.629 --> 18:13.713
Okay, mom, I'll get
there as soon as I can.

18:13.764 --> 18:15.215
All right?

18:15.266 --> 18:16.466
Pain in the ass.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.051
What? Everything all right?
Pipe burst

18:18.102 --> 18:19.886
in my mother's apartment;
I got to go help her out.

18:19.937 --> 18:21.838
Can you cover
the witness for me?

18:21.856 --> 18:23.273
Sure.

18:23.307 --> 18:25.275
Thanks. I'll get there
as soon as I can.

18:25.309 --> 18:26.860
Okay.

19:08.055 --> 19:10.140
What the hell's going on?

19:10.174 --> 19:11.975
What did you tell Hawkins?

19:12.009 --> 19:14.544
That I had to go fix
a leak at my mom's. Why?

19:14.562 --> 19:15.878
Do you think he bought it?

19:15.896 --> 19:17.313
I don't know. Hey.

19:17.348 --> 19:20.517
What's going on?

19:28.275 --> 19:29.943
Hawkins?

19:29.994 --> 19:31.394
No way. Not possible.

19:31.412 --> 19:33.563
I'm telling you, your
source is wrong.

19:33.597 --> 19:35.398
I can prove it to you.
How?

19:35.416 --> 19:38.401
There's a file...
an encrypted file on his laptop.

19:38.419 --> 19:40.253
I need you to copy it
and send it to me.

19:40.287 --> 19:41.254
Mike, that sounds crazy.

19:41.288 --> 19:43.739
I know what it sounds like,
but once you see the file...

19:43.757 --> 19:45.258
Look, I'm not stealing
from another cop's computer.

19:45.292 --> 19:46.576
Bird...
He's my partner.

19:48.596 --> 19:51.848
What was I? Huh?

19:51.882 --> 19:53.349
What was I?

19:53.384 --> 19:54.584
And for how long?

19:54.602 --> 19:57.220
I know you're going through a rough
time, and a suspension on top of it...

19:57.254 --> 19:59.055
It's got nothing
to do with the suspension.

19:59.089 --> 20:02.358
This is about a man who tried
to kill me and he killed my son.

20:02.393 --> 20:06.446
All right, so for Rex's sake, for our
sake, for all the years we spent

20:06.480 --> 20:10.533
watching each other's back,
I'm asking you, trust me.

20:10.568 --> 20:12.452
One last time.

20:12.486 --> 20:14.571
Get me this file.

20:16.490 --> 20:20.460
Bird... I'm begging you.

20:20.494 --> 20:23.930
Please.

20:24.949 --> 20:27.550
You better be right.

20:36.126 --> 20:37.960
They could've been talking
about anything.

20:37.978 --> 20:41.564
Why would he lie about where he
was going, who he was meeting?

20:41.599 --> 20:43.566
What's this he's handing him?

20:43.601 --> 20:44.734
I don't know.

20:44.768 --> 20:46.402
Again, it could be anything.

20:46.437 --> 20:47.403
Britten knows.

20:47.438 --> 20:48.638
No, we don't know that.

20:48.656 --> 20:50.023
He's having sketch artists
draw pictures.

20:50.074 --> 20:52.659
He's chasing Hawkins down the street...
And he's suspended.

20:52.693 --> 20:54.644
You think he needs a badge
to bring this down?

20:56.113 --> 20:57.196
They got to go.

20:57.248 --> 20:58.314
They?

20:58.349 --> 20:59.782
Look at these pictures.

20:59.816 --> 21:01.784
You want to risk
everything on the hope

21:01.818 --> 21:04.120
that they're just talking
about the weather?

21:04.154 --> 21:08.091
If Britten tells Bird anything, Britten
disappears and Bird finds out,

21:08.125 --> 21:09.342
Bird's gonna be all over this.

21:09.376 --> 21:11.494
We got to clean this up
once and for all.

21:11.512 --> 21:15.782
You're talking about
two decorated police officers.

21:15.816 --> 21:19.669
No, I'm talking about
one decorated police officer

21:19.687 --> 21:22.972
and one suspended, mentally
unstable police officer.

21:25.175 --> 21:27.527
We can make this work for us.

21:27.561 --> 21:29.279
How fast can you move on this?

21:29.313 --> 21:31.447
Say the word.

22:40.217 --> 22:41.417
Hi.
Hi.

23:00.287 --> 23:01.120
Hey, perfect timing, man.

23:01.155 --> 23:05.024
Look... I'm on hold with
a repair guy for my mom,

23:05.059 --> 23:05.958
and there's nobody else
in the bullpen.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.543
And I been dying of thirst.

23:07.578 --> 23:09.545
You think you could, uh,
pick up a soda?

23:09.580 --> 23:11.130
Okay.

23:11.165 --> 23:12.882
Thanks, man. You know,
I been on there for a while.

23:12.916 --> 23:14.784
They'd probably pick up
and hang up if I run away.

23:14.802 --> 23:16.135
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
You know how it is.

23:16.170 --> 23:17.220
Right, right. Diet soda?

23:17.254 --> 23:18.755
That's funny.

23:18.789 --> 23:19.922
Appreciate it, though.

23:19.956 --> 23:21.057
I got your back.
You know.

23:21.091 --> 23:22.425
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know you do.

23:33.670 --> 23:34.654
All right.

23:42.863 --> 23:44.030
Where's my soda?

23:44.081 --> 23:45.531
Broken.

23:45.582 --> 23:46.783
Ah...
Cutbacks.

23:47.918 --> 23:49.202
Everything all right
with your mom?

23:49.253 --> 23:53.840
Yeah, you know, you fix one thing and
then ten more give you problems.

23:53.874 --> 23:56.259
I know exactly how you feel.

24:23.590 --> 24:25.590
It's downloading right now.

24:25.616 --> 24:28.184
You're doing
the right thing, Bird.

24:28.218 --> 24:31.220
You mean lying to my partner
or risking my job?

24:31.271 --> 24:32.939
Look, wait till
you see the file.

24:32.973 --> 24:34.857
I promise you,
you'll understand.

24:34.892 --> 24:39.011
So either my new partner's dirty
or my old one's paranoid.

24:39.029 --> 24:41.764
I'm not paranoid.
You'll see.

24:41.798 --> 24:44.217
Either way, it's a lose-lose
situation for me.

24:44.251 --> 24:45.568
I'm sorry.

24:45.619 --> 24:48.204
Promise me you'll get help
if you're wrong.

24:48.238 --> 24:49.822
I'm not wrong.

24:49.856 --> 24:53.409
How you gonna access the file?
It's encrypted.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.378
Remember Francis, the weird kid
in angelino heights?

24:55.412 --> 24:56.579
The Google guy?

24:56.613 --> 24:57.547
Yeah, of course.

24:57.581 --> 24:59.382
He's my guy.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.633
I'll call you from there.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.835
Mike...

25:36.837 --> 25:37.903
Who is it?

25:37.921 --> 25:39.571
Francis, this is
Detective Britten.

25:39.590 --> 25:41.740
I was Detective Freeman's
partner.

25:41.758 --> 25:43.092
Open up.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.844
I need a favor.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.245
I don't do favors.

25:46.263 --> 25:48.130
It's a job.

25:48.181 --> 25:49.415
A private job.

25:49.433 --> 25:51.017
I'll pay you for it.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.735
Francis!

25:55.939 --> 25:57.807
You look like crap.

25:57.858 --> 25:59.892
Thanks.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.527
What kind of job is it?

26:01.561 --> 26:02.528
You gonna let me in?

26:02.562 --> 26:04.113
I don't know yet.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.781
You don't know.

26:05.816 --> 26:09.452
I'm not gonna know until you tell me
what kind of job you're talking about.

26:09.486 --> 26:11.287
I need you to decrypt a
password-protected file.

26:11.321 --> 26:13.572
It's on a disc image.
What do you charge for that?

26:13.606 --> 26:14.657
It depends.

26:14.708 --> 26:15.992
On what?

26:16.043 --> 26:18.711
If the password's five characters,
I can crack it in an hour.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.413
Six, it's gonna take 24.

26:20.447 --> 26:23.332
Seven characters...
Whew... two weeks.

26:23.383 --> 26:24.967
Two...!
Two weeks.

26:25.002 --> 26:28.004
And that's twice as fast as the
next guy, so you're welcome to...

26:28.055 --> 26:29.472
All right, I got this.
Here, for a down payment.

26:29.506 --> 26:30.506
It's a rolex submariner.

26:30.557 --> 26:34.593
It's got to be worth at least...
I know what it is.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.012
What, did you steal this
from evidence?

26:36.063 --> 26:37.980
No.

26:38.015 --> 26:40.599
Okay, then how's a cop afford
a timepiece like this?

26:40.633 --> 26:42.985
He inherits it from his father.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.137
You must really want
to get in this file.

26:57.584 --> 26:58.984
Whatever you're
working on, put it down.

26:59.002 --> 27:00.286
We got a rush job.

27:06.810 --> 27:10.296
These local merchants
are right on the street.

27:10.330 --> 27:12.882
They know what's going on out there
better than anybody in this room.

27:12.933 --> 27:17.136
But they're starting to tell each other...
I gotta go see my mom.

27:17.170 --> 27:19.605
Damn plumbers cost more
than them plastic surgeons.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.856
And they don't even show up.

27:20.891 --> 27:22.141
Right.

27:22.175 --> 27:26.529
...your cars, if you're driving by, they
look out the window, you look in then?

27:26.563 --> 27:28.814
No, you don't;
You keep on going.

27:42.295 --> 27:43.695
You find anything?

27:43.714 --> 27:44.997
Yeah.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.499
Hawkins isn't as smart
as he thinks he is,

27:46.533 --> 27:48.033
or he would've used more
characters in his password.

27:48.051 --> 27:50.553
Did you find something?

27:50.587 --> 27:54.924
A lease agreement for a self-storage
facility, dated five months ago.

27:54.975 --> 27:56.175
Am I missing something?

27:56.209 --> 27:58.978
The lease started the day
after Westfield shut down.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.546
The day after.

28:00.564 --> 28:03.265
So you're saying that Hawkins
moved drugs from Westfield

28:03.316 --> 28:04.734
into this storage facility.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.718
Well, he moved something.

28:06.737 --> 28:08.521
And then they tried
to kill me the same night.

28:08.555 --> 28:10.823
You think the timing's
a coincidence?

28:10.857 --> 28:13.075
Well, unless we find drugs
in the storage container,

28:13.110 --> 28:16.245
the lease doesn't prove anything
except that Hawkins rented out space.

28:16.279 --> 28:19.448
Well... he's in this
with at least one other cop.

28:19.499 --> 28:20.416
Who?

28:22.169 --> 28:23.169
Kessel. Carl Kessel.

28:23.203 --> 28:24.253
You sure?

28:24.287 --> 28:26.789
Well, I'm looking at his signature
on a scanned copy of the lease.

28:27.841 --> 28:30.259
He's the captain over here.

28:32.295 --> 28:34.246
Think about it.
It makes sense.

28:34.264 --> 28:37.216
Kessel would've assigned Hawkins
to you to watch over you,

28:37.250 --> 28:38.768
see if you knew anything.

28:40.554 --> 28:43.606
Okay, then we better find out
what's in the storage container.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.723
What time do you get off?

28:44.757 --> 28:46.058
I'll meet you at your place.

28:46.092 --> 28:49.061
6:00. If I'm not there,
you know where the key is.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.113
Thanks, partner.

28:51.148 --> 28:53.599
Don't thank me yet.

28:56.620 --> 29:01.540
If the store owners don't feel safe, then
we can't count on their cooperation,

29:01.575 --> 29:03.775
which is crucial to what we do.

29:03.794 --> 29:06.912
So I need every one of you to
start getting out of your cars,

29:06.946 --> 29:08.614
and putting in some face time
with these people.

29:08.632 --> 29:11.484
Make sure they know
we're on their side.

29:17.340 --> 29:20.926
So your father...
He really give you this?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.928
Yeah.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.630
Where'd he get it?

29:24.648 --> 29:28.300
His father.

29:28.318 --> 29:32.188
Hey, just... take it.

29:32.239 --> 29:34.273
Rather have you owe me.

29:41.615 --> 29:46.535
It should have been me...
Not you.

29:46.586 --> 29:48.921
<i>Not either of you.</i>

29:52.709 --> 29:58.664
<i>But I swear to you both</i> that I will
find the people who did this...

29:58.698 --> 30:01.483
And I'll make them pay.

30:11.945 --> 30:13.229
Bird, you home?

30:36.887 --> 30:37.887
Bird!

30:37.921 --> 30:40.205
Oh, God.

30:40.223 --> 30:43.375
Oh, no.

30:43.393 --> 30:44.727
No...

30:48.598 --> 30:50.649
Let me see your hands.

30:50.684 --> 30:52.902
You son of a bitch.

30:52.936 --> 30:53.986
Now!

31:03.062 --> 31:07.733
Just having a few beers...
With my partner.

31:07.751 --> 31:08.734
Watching the game.

31:08.752 --> 31:09.835
You stormed in.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.503
Going off about some
crazy conspiracy theory.

31:11.538 --> 31:13.956
Bird tried to calm you down,
and you shot him.

31:15.842 --> 31:18.177
So I fired back.

31:18.211 --> 31:19.962
Self-defense.

31:20.013 --> 31:22.798
No one's ever gonna believe
I would hurt Bird.

31:22.849 --> 31:24.750
We'll see.

31:24.768 --> 31:27.753
IA knows about the storage unit.

31:27.771 --> 31:29.305
That's not true.
You're lying.

31:29.356 --> 31:31.774
I took the file off your laptop.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.642
It had the lease with your name
and Kessel's name on it.

31:33.693 --> 31:35.093
You're lying.

31:35.111 --> 31:38.430
Then how do I know
your password's "tulip"?

32:02.040 --> 32:05.140
I'll start by confirming what most
of you know already:

32:05.366 --> 32:07.067
Just over an hour ago,

32:07.085 --> 32:10.537
our former colleague, Detective
Isaiah Freeman, was murdered

32:10.571 --> 32:14.758
by one of our own...
Detective Michael Britten.

32:14.792 --> 32:18.879
Like many of you,
I worked with Isaiah for years.

32:18.913 --> 32:24.768
He was an excellent detective, but,
more than that, he-he was a friend.

32:24.802 --> 32:29.422
This is a tragic loss,
and I am... saddened.

32:35.780 --> 32:43.203
But right now, everyone in this room needs
to focus on finding Michael Britten

32:43.237 --> 32:45.205
before he can harm anyone else.

32:45.239 --> 32:51.277
This is our responsibility as officers
of the law and as colleagues of Isaiah.

32:55.083 --> 32:56.550
Detective Britten's
psychological health

32:56.584 --> 33:00.720
has been in question for some time now,
and at this point, we can only assume

33:00.755 --> 33:02.923
that he has crossed
into psychosis.

33:02.957 --> 33:06.810
He's also extremely well-trained,
armed, and dangerous.

33:06.844 --> 33:12.816
If, at any point, during the course of
apprehending him, you have to choose

33:12.850 --> 33:15.769
between putting your own life
at risk or using lethal force

33:15.803 --> 33:19.773
as far as I'm concerned,
there's no choice at all.

33:19.807 --> 33:23.660
Do what you have to do
to protect yourself

33:23.694 --> 33:26.947
and the lives of the people
around you.

33:26.981 --> 33:30.083
Brief me every half-hour
until we find him.

33:30.118 --> 33:31.918
Let's make this right.

33:31.953 --> 33:33.170
That's all.

33:33.204 --> 33:36.489
Detective... My office.

33:41.095 --> 33:43.380
When did you last hear
from Britten?

33:43.431 --> 33:45.048
Not since he was suspended.

33:45.099 --> 33:46.716
I called him a couple of times.

33:46.767 --> 33:48.468
And he didn't call you back? No.

33:48.502 --> 33:51.354
Okay. Can you think of anything
that he said to you,

33:51.389 --> 33:54.357
any possible insight
into where his mind is at?

33:54.392 --> 33:58.528
If there is, you need to tell me now
because it could save lives. Yes, ma'am.

33:58.563 --> 34:00.614
But I really can't
think of anything.

34:00.648 --> 34:03.516
Did he talk about
any crazy theories?

34:03.534 --> 34:05.452
Theories?
I don't know.

34:05.486 --> 34:07.520
I mean, I'm not the one
who had a psychotic break.

34:07.538 --> 34:12.309
<i>Did you notice any
change in his, in his behavior?</i>

34:12.342 --> 34:15.829
<i>Did he express</i>
<i>any paranoid delusions,</i>

34:15.862 --> 34:17.496
talk of conspiracies
against him?

34:17.531 --> 34:19.498
No.

34:19.533 --> 34:24.504
Captain...
For the last few months,

34:24.538 --> 34:27.974
me and Britten had worked a lot
of cases together,

34:28.009 --> 34:31.393
and, yes, I have seen him
do some weird things.

34:31.429 --> 34:34.014
But you get to know someone,

34:34.047 --> 34:37.817
<i>and I swear, there is no way</i>
<i>he'd kill his old partner.</i>

34:37.851 --> 34:40.687
<i>It's just not possible, and I</i>
<i>keep thinking to myself,</i>

34:40.721 --> 34:42.272
<i>there's gotta be</i>
<i>other explanations...</i>

34:42.322 --> 34:44.357
No, you can just stop right
there, detective. Captain...

34:44.391 --> 34:48.061
We had a veteran officer murdered in
cold blood in front of an eyewitness.

34:48.079 --> 34:50.197
And you sit here
and you make excuses

34:50.231 --> 34:52.282
because you and britten
had a few heart-to-hearts?

34:52.333 --> 34:53.900
I'm giving you
my honest opinion.

34:53.918 --> 34:55.869
Based on what,
your vast experience?

34:55.902 --> 35:01.508
You save your compassion for detective
Bird and his friends and family,

35:01.542 --> 35:03.043
not his killer.

35:05.012 --> 35:06.746
We're done.

35:43.751 --> 35:45.418
Attention, all units:

35:45.452 --> 35:48.555
Respond to a 187,
corner of spring and 803.

36:29.997 --> 36:31.731
Bird.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.051
Thank God.

36:35.102 --> 36:36.669
For what?

36:36.687 --> 36:39.022
Just that you're here, brother.

36:40.224 --> 36:42.192
Well, I wish I wasn't.

36:42.226 --> 36:44.394
Not under these circumstances.

36:45.997 --> 36:49.366
Look, uh, I'm going to give you
some advice as a friend.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.568
Just keep your mouth shut.

36:51.619 --> 36:55.905
All that crazy stuff about Hawkins
killing Hannah for heroin and...

36:55.956 --> 36:57.240
Just keep that to yourself.

36:57.274 --> 37:00.143
It's only gonna make things wor...
Are you listening to me?

37:00.177 --> 37:01.328
Where's Hawkins' laptop?

37:01.362 --> 37:04.530
What?
I know the password.

37:05.499 --> 37:06.966
<i>Tulip.</i>

37:07.001 --> 37:09.586
The password to the encrypted
file... I know it now.

37:09.637 --> 37:11.588
Look, you've been out cold
for the last half an hour.

37:11.639 --> 37:13.590
How you gonna know something you
didn't know a half an hour ago?

37:13.641 --> 37:15.258
Because I do, okay? I...
Come on!

37:15.309 --> 37:17.143
Look.

37:17.178 --> 37:18.812
You know the last few months

37:18.846 --> 37:21.181
there have been things that...
That I couldn't know.

37:21.215 --> 37:23.683
But I know them anyway.

37:23.717 --> 37:25.352
Right?

37:25.386 --> 37:26.553
This is like that.

37:26.587 --> 37:28.221
Just trust me.

37:28.239 --> 37:30.273
The password is "tulip."

37:30.324 --> 37:32.826
J-just try it
for me.

37:35.396 --> 37:37.197
All right.

37:37.231 --> 37:39.332
It's in that folder.

37:40.751 --> 37:41.718
Tulip.

37:41.752 --> 37:45.455
T-u-l...
Look, I know how to spell "tulip."

37:47.208 --> 37:48.341
Open the third document down.

37:48.376 --> 37:51.628
That's the lease agreement
for a storage unit

37:51.679 --> 37:53.713
where they moved the drugs
the day of my accident.

37:53.747 --> 37:56.599
Look at the name of the company
it's leased to.

37:56.634 --> 37:58.351
Westfield distribution.
Right. See who signed it.

37:58.386 --> 38:01.855
Carl kessel.

38:01.889 --> 38:03.857
That's Hawkins' precinct chief.

38:03.891 --> 38:06.443
Oh, now, h-how did you...
Doesn't matter.

38:06.477 --> 38:07.944
It's proof.

38:07.978 --> 38:10.530
Let's go and show it to
who we need to show it to.

38:10.564 --> 38:14.734
Let's go and find out
who killed my wife and why.

38:17.088 --> 38:20.740
I'll need to take another look at
this before you send it to district.

38:20.774 --> 38:22.158
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.

38:28.282 --> 38:30.583
Come into the office.

38:37.091 --> 38:38.958
What happened to you?

38:38.976 --> 38:40.460
Why is he in cuffs?

38:40.478 --> 38:43.263
Because he shot and killed
the Detective Ed Hawkins

38:43.297 --> 38:45.765
from the Western division,
but before you even think

38:45.799 --> 38:49.652
about charging him, I think you want
to listen to what he has to say

38:49.687 --> 38:52.155
and take a look at what
we found in Hawkins' house.

38:52.189 --> 38:55.742
The accident that killed
my wife wasn't an accident.

38:55.776 --> 38:57.994
It was an attempt on my life.

38:58.028 --> 39:02.499
The reason I was targeted because
I received an anonymous tip

39:02.533 --> 39:05.585
about heroin being distributed through
Westfield distribution center

39:05.619 --> 39:10.089
by at least two dirty cops.

39:10.124 --> 39:11.841
You've got nothing.

39:11.876 --> 39:13.426
I got a full confession.

39:13.461 --> 39:14.677
From who, Hawkins?

39:14.712 --> 39:16.463
The detective
that you shot dead?

39:16.497 --> 39:17.663
Did he sign something?

39:17.681 --> 39:20.266
No... yes, he signed the lease
for the storage unit

39:20.301 --> 39:21.885
with his captain,
this captain kessel,

39:21.936 --> 39:24.771
on the day he tried to kill me;
Isn't that enough?

39:24.805 --> 39:26.856
How does signing
a lease agreement prove that

39:26.891 --> 39:29.859
he stole heroin from narcotics
division and was selling it?

39:29.894 --> 39:31.177
I-it doesn't.
That's what I'm saying.

39:31.195 --> 39:34.147
That's why we gotta open up the storage
unit before kessel gets a chance

39:34.181 --> 39:35.198
to move the drugs.

39:35.232 --> 39:39.285
Michael, you know, I'm
struggling to understand. Why?

39:39.320 --> 39:42.372
What, all of a sudden,
brought you to these people?

39:42.406 --> 39:44.023
My memory.

39:44.041 --> 39:47.377
Your memory.

39:50.247 --> 39:51.881
I remember.

39:51.916 --> 39:55.335
Hawkins...
My memory's coming back.

39:55.369 --> 39:59.506
If you open this storage facility,
you'll see that I'm right.

39:59.540 --> 40:02.892
And does your memory tell you
about anyone or anything else?

40:02.927 --> 40:03.893
No.

40:03.928 --> 40:05.478
I mean, not so far.

40:05.513 --> 40:07.263
There must be someone
in narcotics obviously.

40:07.314 --> 40:09.265
Did Hawkins say anything else?

40:09.316 --> 40:11.234
No.

40:11.268 --> 40:13.603
Who else did you tell
about this?

40:13.637 --> 40:15.555
We came straight to you.

40:15.573 --> 40:19.392
And Hawkins' body,
you just left it there?

40:21.078 --> 40:22.395
Yeah.

40:22.413 --> 40:24.364
All right.

40:24.398 --> 40:26.199
I need to send a team
over there.

40:26.233 --> 40:28.585
We've got to secure the crime scene.
No, no, you can't.

40:28.619 --> 40:32.255
Look, if captain kessel finds
out Hawkins is dead, that's it.

40:32.289 --> 40:34.257
He'll move the drugs
or-or get away.

40:34.291 --> 40:36.259
Hawkins...
he's in his house.

40:36.293 --> 40:37.961
The door's locked.
He's dead.

40:38.012 --> 40:39.579
He's not going anywhere.

40:39.613 --> 40:45.602
Tricia... I'm telling you,
these bastards killed my wife.

40:48.105 --> 40:50.557
Believe me.

40:50.591 --> 40:55.311
Captain, we're gonna have to look
into the storage facility eventually.

40:55.362 --> 41:00.266
Why not let me get a small team
together and go check it out.

41:01.952 --> 41:03.953
Okay.

41:06.373 --> 41:07.991
Thank you.

41:08.042 --> 41:10.577
I don't know why
you're thanking me.

41:10.611 --> 41:13.162
You'll be waiting in a holding
cell, and if Bird doesn't

41:13.213 --> 41:16.299
come back with something better than
your word against a dead cop's,

41:16.333 --> 41:18.968
I don't know how you're
going to get out of there.

41:19.003 --> 41:21.287
We will.

41:41.475 --> 41:47.563
Mike... I don't know how
you know what you know...

41:47.598 --> 41:50.483
But I damn sure hope
you're right.

41:50.501 --> 41:53.553
Me, too.
