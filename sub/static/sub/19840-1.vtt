00:00.269 --> 00:01.643
<i>Previously, on</i> Greenleaf...

00:01.682 --> 00:03.274
- Are you gay?
- I don't know.

00:03.308 --> 00:06.182
- What's going on?
- Something's wrong with the twins.

00:06.275 --> 00:07.969
I just think I'm ready to make a move.

00:08.135 --> 00:09.510
Mmm. And Pastor, here,

00:09.545 --> 00:11.334
seems like he's ready to do the same.

00:11.368 --> 00:14.182
This project, Basie has me slated
to run for him over at Triumph.

00:14.216 --> 00:16.038
It's gonna be a $40 million
Christian community center.

00:16.072 --> 00:17.702
Basie's just trying to get back at me.

00:17.736 --> 00:19.174
- For what?
- Well, I haven't the slightest idea.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.375
But with you as my eyes
and ears, we'll find out.

00:21.408 --> 00:22.392
When did this happen?

00:22.426 --> 00:23.676
I got the notice of seizure

00:23.709 --> 00:25.214
from the city a couple months ago.

00:25.252 --> 00:26.979
Whoever Mac has in his pocket

00:27.012 --> 00:28.194
at City Hall ain't budging.

00:28.228 --> 00:31.618
- I never touched her.
- Stop lying!

00:31.658 --> 00:33.733
You and that daughter of mine...

00:33.759 --> 00:35.965
you think I don't know the role
you played in all this?

00:35.998 --> 00:37.340
Mac had to be stopped.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.701
- Is there any way out?
- You just have to confess.

00:39.735 --> 00:40.957
<i>Remember when you was little</i>

00:40.991 --> 00:42.707
and First Baptist burned down?

00:42.741 --> 00:45.116
And the caretaker was in the basement?

00:45.150 --> 00:47.325
- What about it?
- That wasn't no act of God.

00:49.279 --> 00:51.069
What are you doing here?

00:57.279 --> 00:58.589
Who told you I did this?

00:58.623 --> 00:59.901
This nasty piece of work?

00:59.934 --> 01:02.557
No. Mr. McCready's father, Henry.

01:02.591 --> 01:04.029
What did Henry say, exactly?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.628
That you paid him to burn down

01:05.663 --> 01:07.421
First Baptist Church in 1983.

01:07.454 --> 01:10.524
- My own church?
- The one Daryl James died in, yes.

01:10.559 --> 01:12.604
So, this is how the system works.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.197
He dredges up any old...

01:15.230 --> 01:18.077
piece of gossip and... and now what?

01:18.110 --> 01:19.869
It's not gossip, James. You know it.

01:19.903 --> 01:22.012
I will not defend myself
against a known criminal.

01:22.046 --> 01:23.740
Why is this man out of jail?

01:24.958 --> 01:26.492
Before we continue this conversation,

01:26.526 --> 01:27.740
we need to speak to a lawyer.

01:27.773 --> 01:29.436
I think that would be wise.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.324
This investigation is ongoing,

01:31.358 --> 01:33.180
so do us and yourself a favor, Bishop...

01:33.214 --> 01:34.300
don't leave town.

01:49.085 --> 01:50.747
Is this what you've been keeping from me

01:50.782 --> 01:51.900
all these years?

01:51.934 --> 01:53.403
I couldn't have you implicated.

01:53.437 --> 01:54.746
- I...
- You...

01:56.125 --> 01:57.435
I couldn't let that happen.

01:57.468 --> 01:58.971
You...

02:00.508 --> 02:01.819
I'm sorry.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.707
Oh, God forgive me.

02:09.084 --> 02:10.681
You wait a minute! Wait!

02:10.716 --> 02:11.866
I don't know what kind of deal you cut

02:11.901 --> 02:13.819
to get out of jail with this story.

02:13.852 --> 02:17.722
- You're going back.
- Oh, I'm not going anywhere but home.

02:17.757 --> 02:20.250
It's called deferred
adjudication, Pastor.

02:20.284 --> 02:22.010
I asked the bishop to speak on my behalf

02:22.044 --> 02:24.187
at my sentencing hearing and he passed.

02:24.221 --> 02:28.281
So I was forced to pull
some other less holy strings.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.234
No, that's impossible.

02:30.267 --> 02:32.706
Oh, ye of little faith.

02:33.276 --> 02:36.570
You think your daddy's the only one I got
the gospel on, girl?

02:36.604 --> 02:38.554
With what I know about the folks
who run this town,

02:38.588 --> 02:40.346
I could burn all of Memphis
to the ground,

02:40.380 --> 02:43.193
walk away with nothing
on my back but hot wind.

Hello?

03:41.946 --> 03:43.704
<i>Is this Mavis McCready?</i>

03:45.277 --> 03:46.715
Yeah. Who's this?

03:46.749 --> 03:48.219
<i>My name's Trevor Sneiderman, ma'am.</i>

03:48.253 --> 03:50.107
<i>I'm calling from Bev-Co.</i>

03:50.141 --> 03:52.283
<i>My records show you haven't
ordered from us in a while</i>

03:52.317 --> 03:54.075
<i>and we were wondering if maybe
you'd like to put in...</i>

03:54.109 --> 03:55.995
What you calling me on a Sunday for?

03:56.029 --> 03:57.307
<i>Well, I'm sorry about the day, ma'am.</i>

03:57.342 --> 03:59.100
I don't have a club no more.

04:05.789 --> 04:07.483
Alonzo!

04:09.309 --> 04:10.875
Alonzo!

04:13.661 --> 04:16.091
Get your ass to church.

04:16.124 --> 04:17.562
You know I told that woman
from <i> Blues Weekly</i>

04:17.596 --> 04:19.034
you were there every Sunday.

04:19.067 --> 04:21.754
So go put that suit on I bought you

04:21.788 --> 04:22.970
and get on out of here.

04:30.781 --> 04:32.975
Oh, here. You want some?

04:33.411 --> 04:35.457
I told you, I don't mess
with that Oxy devil.

04:37.595 --> 04:39.194
Suit yourself.

04:56.795 --> 04:59.025
Now, Fall Revival's coming up

04:59.060 --> 05:01.165
and I know that you know
what that means.

05:01.179 --> 05:03.226
It's a time of year when we ask
for an additional offering.

05:03.259 --> 05:06.681
Now, church, God has
been faithful to Calvary.

05:06.715 --> 05:08.857
Hasn't He carried us over the mountains?

05:08.891 --> 05:11.032
Hasn't He lit our path in the valleys?

05:11.066 --> 05:14.537
Now is the time to partner
with what He wants to do,

05:14.557 --> 05:16.988
what he wants to release
into this world.

05:17.021 --> 05:20.027
So, you can grab those
pledge forms from the ushers

05:20.060 --> 05:21.691
and you can fill them out boldly.

05:21.724 --> 05:23.579
Give and it will be given unto you.

05:23.613 --> 05:24.891
Church, God is not done.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.682
He is still on the throne.

05:26.716 --> 05:27.900
Praise Him.

05:27.933 --> 05:30.587
Praise Him. Thank you, Jesus.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.859
Thank you, Jesus.

05:40.988 --> 05:43.131
Powerful sermon.

05:43.165 --> 05:46.522
Never seen so many people
forcibly uninspired.

05:46.556 --> 05:48.059
But that's a kind of gift, I suppose.

05:48.092 --> 05:49.466
What do you want, Mama?

05:49.501 --> 05:51.354
I had Darlene run the numbers

05:51.388 --> 05:53.370
from the Fall Revival this morning.

05:55.196 --> 05:57.659
It's down 40%.

05:57.692 --> 05:59.322
Half the deacon board
didn't even pledge.

05:59.355 --> 06:00.730
Here, see for yourself.

06:02.652 --> 06:04.506
Betty Wilcox, Deacon Sykes...

06:04.540 --> 06:06.170
I can't say that I blame them.

06:06.204 --> 06:08.090
And what is that supposed to mean?

06:08.124 --> 06:11.193
It has been three months since the police
opened that case against Daddy.

06:11.227 --> 06:14.650
Not a week goes by there's not
something about him in the newspapers.

06:14.683 --> 06:16.441
And he's never come forward
and said he didn't do it.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.490
Because it's an ongoing investigation.

06:18.523 --> 06:21.210
His lawyers have instructed
him in no uncertain terms...

06:21.243 --> 06:23.129
Whatever. <i>That</i> is why
people aren't pledging.

06:23.162 --> 06:24.538
It's not my fault.

06:24.571 --> 06:27.065
This whole mess is your fault.

06:27.098 --> 06:29.338
I will speak to the deacon board.

06:29.371 --> 06:32.856
I've already started
begging God to show me

06:32.891 --> 06:35.001
how to let this church go.

06:35.034 --> 06:36.921
I'm talking about your father.

06:36.954 --> 06:39.480
He is sick, and any day now

06:39.515 --> 06:42.016
he could be charged
and dragged into prison.

06:42.554 --> 06:44.679
He could die in prison.

06:46.202 --> 06:48.441
I don't know what to say.
I'm doing my best, Mama.

06:48.474 --> 06:49.944
That is all I can do.

06:53.274 --> 06:55.736
What? What?

06:57.881 --> 06:59.383
Your pride,

06:59.833 --> 07:01.720
your terrible pride

07:01.753 --> 07:03.640
is gonna destroy us all.

07:41.090 --> 07:42.623
You're up early.

07:44.161 --> 07:45.919
I couldn't sleep.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.984
I had the nightmare again.

07:50.017 --> 07:52.831
I just can't stop thinking
about poor Daryl.

07:55.489 --> 07:57.600
He wasn't supposed to be there.

08:14.817 --> 08:16.255
It was an accident.

08:30.657 --> 08:32.126
Good morning.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.982
Morning, Mama.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.741
Any fresh libel in the paper
about us this morning, Jacob?

08:41.914 --> 08:44.350
Oh, people love to see
the high brought low,

08:44.383 --> 08:47.261
even if based on nothing
but hearsay and lies.

08:47.295 --> 08:48.478
Just this Friday feature

08:48.511 --> 08:50.205
about churchgoers in the DA's office,

08:50.239 --> 08:52.604
Some are saying they're slowing
the investigation down.

08:52.704 --> 08:54.623
Written by this Darius Nash?

08:56.371 --> 08:58.610
What an insidious way this man has.

09:00.051 --> 09:01.681
Oh, uh, Maricel, would you please

09:01.716 --> 09:04.049
bring some more waffles
and pecans, dear?

09:04.083 --> 09:05.457
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

09:05.491 --> 09:07.249
- Good morning, family.
- Good morning.

09:07.282 --> 09:08.753
Morning, Bishop.

09:08.787 --> 09:12.209
Well, I can't wait to preach again.

09:12.242 --> 09:15.728
I was just reading in <i> Ezra about
the rebuilding of the temple.</i>

09:15.763 --> 09:17.393
Whoo!

09:17.427 --> 09:19.633
And the Lord has given me
some strong words

09:19.666 --> 09:21.168
for the people on that.

09:21.202 --> 09:22.577
- Ooh, thank you.
- That reminds me,

09:22.610 --> 09:24.720
I have some Bible reading
to do before work, so.

09:24.755 --> 09:27.248
Sweetheart. Family.

09:27.283 --> 09:28.906
Later, Gigi.

09:29.767 --> 09:32.293
Your mother always was the scholar.

09:32.435 --> 09:34.635
Time with the text.

09:34.735 --> 09:36.526
Never wasted.

09:38.065 --> 09:40.592
And he's produced
Marvin Sapp and Mary Mary.

09:40.626 --> 09:42.736
He's at Ardent all week working
with them on a record.

09:42.769 --> 09:45.392
Mm. You sure you're not
just selling me on him

09:45.426 --> 09:47.120
'cause he's fine, Carlton?

09:47.154 --> 09:48.753
No, honey, I'm taken.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.023
Yes, I know. I was there.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.911
Let me see that.

09:52.945 --> 09:55.024
Oh, now, wait a minute.
That does not mean

09:55.058 --> 09:56.783
we cannot have a little
eye candy, does it?

09:56.817 --> 09:59.056
Look at that!

09:59.089 --> 10:02.447
Everything that this man has produced
turns to gold, and that's what we need.

10:02.481 --> 10:04.848
We need this record to sell and
get the church back in the black.

10:04.881 --> 10:06.041
Yeah.

10:06.263 --> 10:07.894
Hey, so how's that baby doing, huh?

10:07.927 --> 10:09.814
Oof, kicking up a storm.

10:09.847 --> 10:12.950
I told him this morning,
"Just a few more days."

10:12.983 --> 10:14.262
She's inducing Monday.

10:14.295 --> 10:15.861
Wait, there's not a problem, is there?

10:15.895 --> 10:17.846
No. Okay.

10:17.879 --> 10:19.701
No, everything's fine.

10:21.592 --> 10:23.976
The baby's fine. We just, um...

10:24.503 --> 10:28.501
The doctor said that after
losing the other twin,

10:28.535 --> 10:30.230
we should be extra careful.

10:30.754 --> 10:33.748
Well, we will pray for all of you.

11:03.223 --> 11:05.076
Praise God.

11:05.110 --> 11:07.540
Sounds like you really
went through something.

11:07.574 --> 11:09.396
You'd have had to to write like that.

11:09.429 --> 11:11.412
It's been a hard time, that's true,

11:11.445 --> 11:14.260
but the Lord keeps
giving me these songs.

11:14.294 --> 11:16.169
And how many do you have total?

11:17.270 --> 11:19.475
Eleven and a half.

11:19.509 --> 11:21.427
I want to hear all of them.

11:21.462 --> 11:22.803
And then you'll decide?

11:22.838 --> 11:24.723
No. I've decided.

11:26.264 --> 11:27.539
I'll do it.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.290
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:30.325 --> 11:33.235
Oh, my God!

11:33.268 --> 11:34.771
Thank you.

11:34.805 --> 11:37.043
This is so exciting.

11:40.885 --> 11:42.386
Sorry to interrupt.

11:42.420 --> 11:44.434
Oh, it's no interruption.
Jabari Johnson.

11:44.468 --> 11:46.579
Jabari? Kevin.

11:46.612 --> 11:48.178
Director of Outreach.

11:48.212 --> 11:49.875
Nice to meet you.

11:54.292 --> 11:56.087
Think I can talk to my wife
for a second, please?

11:56.121 --> 11:57.735
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

11:58.323 --> 11:59.762
See you at the groundbreaking?

11:59.796 --> 12:01.427
Yeah. I'll be right over.

12:09.684 --> 12:11.090
Why aren't you at home taking it easy?

12:12.627 --> 12:15.153
The doctor told me I can
be up and about, Kevin.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.070
What do you want?

12:47.827 --> 12:49.425
Just come to one meeting.

12:49.458 --> 12:50.935
I don't need to. I don't want to!

12:50.970 --> 12:52.913
I don't know that I buy this
whole "pray the gay away."

12:52.946 --> 12:54.160
That's not what Fortitude is.

12:54.194 --> 12:55.451
If you came to one meeting, you'd see.

12:55.486 --> 12:57.488
It's not a binary thing...
either I'm this or I'm that.

12:57.523 --> 12:58.918
A lot of wives come to the meetings.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.487
- I can't talk about this right now.
- Can't or won't?

13:01.514 --> 13:02.953
C., you're having that baby Monday.

13:02.987 --> 13:04.968
- We need to figure this
out pretty soon. -

13:05.002 --> 13:06.792
- Hey, you gonna make it, Mama?
- Hey!

13:06.826 --> 13:08.328
- Just takes me a minute.
- Hey.

13:09.674 --> 13:11.304
- What's up, baby?
- Hey. How you doing?

13:11.339 --> 13:12.584
- I'm good. How you doing?
- Good.

13:12.618 --> 13:14.568
I hear that they have cotton candy.

13:14.602 --> 13:15.913
Hey, Connie.

13:15.946 --> 13:17.416
So, I still haven't received pledges

13:17.450 --> 13:19.880
from any of the deacons,
so give me a call back, okay?

13:19.915 --> 13:21.192
Thank you.

13:21.226 --> 13:23.112
All right, let's do this.

13:24.778 --> 13:26.632
You think Grandpa did it, don't you?

13:26.665 --> 13:27.816
Why do you say that?

13:27.850 --> 13:29.832
Because it just seems like you do.

13:31.498 --> 13:33.352
Honestly, I don't know.

13:33.385 --> 13:35.143
I just think the fact
that he hasn't denied it

13:35.178 --> 13:37.000
is costing the church money.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.047
Yeah, I mean, it's so annoying.

13:39.081 --> 13:40.679
If he did do it, he didn't know that man

13:40.713 --> 13:42.748
was in the building,
and it was so long ago.

13:42.782 --> 13:43.960
I mean, why be a Christian at all

13:43.995 --> 13:45.511
if you can't just get past what you did?

13:45.546 --> 13:48.071
Mm. There's a difference between
getting past something, honey,

13:48.105 --> 13:50.279
and never admitting it happened.

13:50.313 --> 13:52.678
But if he didn't do it, then
there's nothing to admit to.

13:52.713 --> 13:55.462
Then he should say that, and he
didn't, and that's the problem.

13:55.497 --> 13:56.999
Okay.

13:57.033 --> 13:59.175
- Ooh, Sophia. Pastor Greenleaf.
- Mama.

13:59.208 --> 14:00.615
Wait, are you going
to the groundbreaking?

14:00.649 --> 14:03.846
I'd rather eat glass.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.660
Is that Isaiah Hambrick singing?

14:28.694 --> 14:29.765
In the flesh.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.238
He goes to Triumph?

14:31.272 --> 14:32.645
When he's not playing shows.

14:34.536 --> 14:36.741
Unh-uh. Close your mouth, thirsty.

14:46.247 --> 14:47.525
- Hey!
- That's right.

15:04.455 --> 15:05.380
Whoo!

15:13.255 --> 15:14.821
Good stuff, man.

15:14.855 --> 15:17.604
Good stuff, man. Look at you!

15:17.638 --> 15:19.653
Look at you!

15:19.686 --> 15:21.989
Hey, let's hear it for our
very own Isaiah Hambrick!

15:26.302 --> 15:29.147
It's working for me.
Is it working for you?

15:29.178 --> 15:31.257
Well, Jacob sure has been
studying my Basie

15:31.291 --> 15:32.824
something fierce, hasn't he?

15:32.858 --> 15:34.008
How so?

15:34.042 --> 15:35.768
Well, his stage presence, that's all.

15:37.658 --> 15:40.504
Don't... don't take it the wrong way.
I think it's great.

15:40.538 --> 15:43.288
We all need role models, right?

15:43.322 --> 15:44.536
Amen to that.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.040
Look, we want to thank all of you

15:46.073 --> 15:47.256
for being with us today

15:47.290 --> 15:49.368
at this amazing, amazing event.

15:49.402 --> 15:51.864
Yeah! This is awesome!
God is so awesome.

15:51.898 --> 15:54.264
Now, look, y'all know
I'm the son of a bishop.

15:54.298 --> 15:56.984
All right? I worked in
the church all my life.

15:57.018 --> 15:59.146
- Been raised in the church.
- Where has this Jacob been?

15:59.180 --> 16:01.879
I don't know. But whatever he's
selling, they sure are buying it.

16:01.913 --> 16:02.693
...real with you all.

16:02.727 --> 16:04.314
This brother I'm about
to bring out here,

16:04.341 --> 16:06.067
when he shared his testimony with me,

16:06.101 --> 16:07.891
I was moved, I was so moved.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.899
He came from nothing. Right?

16:10.933 --> 16:13.619
Nobody looking out for him but God.

16:13.653 --> 16:16.338
With nothing but an Amplified Bible,

16:16.373 --> 16:18.675
and the spirit of the Lord in his heart!

16:18.709 --> 16:22.067
Who changed the worst
six blocks of Memphis

16:22.100 --> 16:23.635
into a safe zone

16:23.669 --> 16:26.994
where the spirit of God
is changing lives every day.

16:28.469 --> 16:30.318
Every day!

16:31.188 --> 16:32.850
Ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you

16:32.884 --> 16:34.611
the Reverend Basie Skanks!

16:45.173 --> 16:46.514
Oh!

16:46.548 --> 16:47.634
Oh! Hold on.

16:47.668 --> 16:49.458
Hold on, baby, hold on.

16:49.492 --> 16:51.953
Oh! Triumph, baby!

16:51.988 --> 16:54.066
Oh, what a blessing.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.010
- God is good! Amen! Amen!
- Amen!

16:57.044 --> 16:58.898
I want to thank all the saints

16:58.932 --> 17:01.618
that have made today
as wondrous as it is.

17:01.652 --> 17:03.569
Amen.

17:03.603 --> 17:05.686
Tasha, baby,

17:06.291 --> 17:07.633
you are more than just my wife,

17:07.666 --> 17:09.297
you are my reason and my heart.

17:09.330 --> 17:10.673
I love you so much.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.737
Amen. Amen.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.305
Amen.

17:17.299 --> 17:19.057
Deputy Mayor Skip Leonard

17:19.090 --> 17:22.161
and all the church leaders
who have joined us today

17:22.194 --> 17:26.256
to prove that in Christ there
is no black and no white.

17:26.290 --> 17:28.593
Amen! Amen!

17:29.907 --> 17:33.105
Who I really wanna thank
is this man right here.

17:33.138 --> 17:34.608
All right!

17:36.562 --> 17:38.448
My brother.

17:40.818 --> 17:43.024
My brother, Jacob Greenleaf.

17:43.058 --> 17:44.816
You see, when we bought this land,

17:44.850 --> 17:46.480
the plan was to pick up stakes

17:46.514 --> 17:47.856
and move Triumph over here.

17:47.890 --> 17:51.248
But now that I have seen
this brother in action,

17:51.281 --> 17:54.019
oh, I know he don't need nobody
looking over his shoulder, huh?

17:54.054 --> 17:55.248
Brother's got this!

17:55.282 --> 17:58.128
Amen! Amen.

17:58.162 --> 17:59.738
So, now...

18:00.338 --> 18:03.227
now, with holy humility

18:04.242 --> 18:08.047
that I announce today I'll
keep minding Triumph downtown,

18:08.081 --> 18:12.047
but right here is the new
pastor of Triumph Two...

18:15.697 --> 18:17.424
Jacob Greenleaf.

18:21.627 --> 18:22.585
What?

18:30.289 --> 18:32.463
You deserve it, brother.

18:32.496 --> 18:34.447
You deserve it, brother. You deserve it.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.599
You sure?

18:35.632 --> 18:37.774
I know it. 'Cause God...

18:37.808 --> 18:39.310
Oh!

18:40.816 --> 18:42.734
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

18:42.768 --> 18:44.334
That's the Holy Spirit.

18:44.368 --> 18:47.054
Now, I need you all
to put your hands together

18:47.089 --> 18:49.999
for the one and only Kirk Franklin!

18:50.032 --> 18:52.783
Amen. Amen.

18:52.816 --> 18:55.150
Oh!

18:55.184 --> 18:57.006
Oh! Oh!

18:57.040 --> 18:58.958
Woo!

20:11.600 --> 20:13.838
Heard from a friend in the DA's office.

20:13.872 --> 20:15.949
They're gonna file charges tomorrow.

20:15.983 --> 20:17.326
Arson and manslaughter.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.330
And you're here to gloat.

20:18.364 --> 20:20.045
No, I just thought you'd want to know.

20:20.079 --> 20:22.157
You're still my sister,
whatever James did.

20:22.190 --> 20:23.469
I'm here for you.

20:23.502 --> 20:25.517
Here for me?

20:25.551 --> 20:26.669
Mac, you did this!

20:26.703 --> 20:28.333
James did it, Mae,

20:28.367 --> 20:30.253
and Daddy just told the truth.

20:30.287 --> 20:31.693
We're still family.

20:32.230 --> 20:33.849
Family?

20:34.639 --> 20:37.837
After what you did,
we'll never be family again.

20:40.399 --> 20:42.028
Until you need me.

20:55.406 --> 20:57.096
- That's why I know you're a liar!
- You ain't lying?

20:57.131 --> 21:00.140
I ain't never lied. I always
tell you the truth, every time.

21:00.174 --> 21:02.188
I don't lie neither. Hey, David!

21:02.222 --> 21:04.076
Mavis, how you doing?

21:04.110 --> 21:05.482
Benny around?

21:05.517 --> 21:07.562
No, but he told me to tell you
he won't be back for an hour.

21:07.596 --> 21:09.147
- We can wait.
- Yeah.

21:09.182 --> 21:11.915
- Okay.
- Give me a...

21:11.949 --> 21:13.993
a rye on the rocks.

21:14.797 --> 21:16.332
You know David used to work for me?

21:16.365 --> 21:18.443
Yeah, I know, you told me. Yeah.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.644
Uh... what you looking at?

21:21.678 --> 21:23.275
Miss McCready,

21:23.309 --> 21:25.131
Benny told me I can't serve you anymore.

21:26.488 --> 21:27.927
Huh.

21:27.973 --> 21:29.411
Fine, then.

21:29.436 --> 21:31.354
Serve him. Make it a double.

21:32.973 --> 21:34.583
- A double... two.
- Go ahead. She's all right.

21:36.366 --> 21:38.891
This where I saw Memphis
Slim, first time.

21:38.926 --> 21:41.932
I saw him here.
I saw... I saw Elmore James.

21:41.966 --> 21:44.964
- I saw... I saw John Lee here.
- Yeah.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.179
One day somebody gonna say

21:47.213 --> 21:49.995
this the first place they saw you.

21:50.030 --> 21:52.556
You know, I hope that's right, mama.

21:52.589 --> 21:55.243
Mm. Hope is for suckers.

21:55.277 --> 21:57.515
You keep playing the way
I know you can play...

21:57.549 --> 21:59.755
you won't need no hope.

22:05.453 --> 22:08.108
Who's that? Southern Artists?

22:08.141 --> 22:10.187
No, it's not Southern Artists.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.274
They're gonna take every penny you got.

22:15.309 --> 22:17.323
You wake up five years from now,

22:17.357 --> 22:19.371
hmm, you'll be owing them money.

22:19.405 --> 22:21.578
- That's the way that works.
- It's not Southern Artists.

22:21.612 --> 22:24.427
- I see the area code.
- See the area code.

22:24.460 --> 22:25.962
And it's not Southern Artists.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.498
I told you that.

22:27.532 --> 22:30.378
I-I ain't one of your little lay things.

22:30.412 --> 22:33.258
I know... I seen who that is.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.313
- David?
- Sorry to bother you again, Bishop.

22:38.348 --> 22:40.555
It's not bother, son. I'm glad
somebody cares enough to call.

22:40.588 --> 22:42.153
- Where is she?
- This way.

22:42.188 --> 22:44.106
- What happened this time?
- She got into a fight

22:44.140 --> 22:45.769
with a guy she brought in,
something wicked.

22:45.804 --> 22:48.649
- What guy?
- Alonzo Ashbury. Guitar player.

22:48.684 --> 22:51.241
He used to play at Auntie M's.
I think she's managing him now.

22:51.275 --> 22:53.866
She brought him in yesterday for an
audition, but my boss never showed, so.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.754
So, what was this fight about?

22:55.788 --> 22:57.193
Have to ask her.

23:04.301 --> 23:05.642
Excuse us.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.793
Hey.

23:21.866 --> 23:23.945
Come here.

23:23.978 --> 23:25.704
You all right?

23:27.563 --> 23:29.448
So, I emailed everyone pledge forms.

23:29.482 --> 23:31.529
I haven't gotten a single one back.

23:31.562 --> 23:34.255
Is it because they know that the
bishop's about to be charged now?

23:35.402 --> 23:36.967
I don't want to speak
for the whole board,

23:37.002 --> 23:39.058
but I'm sure that's part of it.

23:39.818 --> 23:42.233
What else is the problem?
What am I missing?

23:43.147 --> 23:47.047
Well, if you ask Betty Wilcox
what the problem is,

23:47.081 --> 23:49.031
she'd say the problem is

23:49.066 --> 23:52.840
we have a male employee
married to another man

23:52.873 --> 23:56.008
and flaunting it all over
the church and Facebook

23:56.042 --> 23:58.056
like it's not a sin.

23:58.089 --> 23:59.648
Carlton?

24:00.824 --> 24:02.152
He didn't even get married at Calvary.

24:02.185 --> 24:03.304
But...

24:03.337 --> 24:05.255
Charity sang at his wedding.

24:05.289 --> 24:06.695
And to some,

24:06.728 --> 24:08.615
that was a tacit affirmation.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.631
Why didn't they just
say that at the meeting?

24:10.665 --> 24:11.687
I asked them.

24:11.721 --> 24:13.895
They would say it to Lady Mae.

24:17.992 --> 24:20.166
So, what was this fight about?

24:20.201 --> 24:22.470
David said you and this boy got into it.

24:23.977 --> 24:25.420
Nothing.

24:25.801 --> 24:27.024
Look,

24:27.336 --> 24:29.062
you get these players
up to a certain level

24:29.096 --> 24:32.486
and then all these
big-time talent agencies,

24:32.520 --> 24:34.086
they start circling,

24:34.111 --> 24:36.326
and I just had to let him know

24:36.360 --> 24:38.919
who set the table that he's
eating at, that's all.

24:38.952 --> 24:41.892
Does he know what he's doing,
letting you drink like this?

24:42.578 --> 24:44.409
Alonzo's not the problem.

24:45.809 --> 24:47.910
Does he know you almost
died the last time?

24:47.944 --> 24:48.934
'Cause I'll tell him.

24:50.856 --> 24:54.033
Alonzo is not the problem.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.006
The problem...

24:56.418 --> 24:58.374
I'm just trying to figure out

24:58.408 --> 25:00.358
where I belong.

25:00.391 --> 25:02.470
Where I belong...

25:03.083 --> 25:04.648
ever since I lost my club.

25:06.343 --> 25:08.613
And I... I'm gonna be fine,

25:08.647 --> 25:11.044
I'm gonna get his business
up and running.

25:11.079 --> 25:13.029
We going on the road.

25:13.063 --> 25:14.981
Everything gonna be fine.

25:18.829 --> 25:20.052
Come on, I'll walk you up.

25:22.423 --> 25:23.941
The last time you helped me upstairs...

25:23.974 --> 25:26.404
That's not what I meant. I just meant...

25:28.561 --> 25:30.085
I just want to make sure you're okay.

25:30.119 --> 25:32.037
I'm fine.

25:35.079 --> 25:36.996
I don't need your help, James.

25:37.030 --> 25:39.281
I got this far without you.

25:40.971 --> 25:42.071
I'm gonna keep going.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.299
You saw the news?

26:19.644 --> 26:21.192
I did, yeah.

26:25.176 --> 26:26.530
Did you do it, Daddy?

26:27.033 --> 26:28.280
Sit with me a second?

26:28.313 --> 26:30.392
No. Just tell me the truth.

26:35.673 --> 26:37.048
I was young, Gigi.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.094
I was young,

26:40.761 --> 26:43.032
and like King David,
success was my Bathsheba.

26:44.825 --> 26:46.904
Churches were opening up
all over town...

26:48.441 --> 26:50.150
and your mother and I were...

26:50.521 --> 26:53.911
unfortunate enough
to buy an old sanctuary

26:53.946 --> 26:55.383
that turned into a money pit.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.803
- Why didn't you sell it?
- We tried.

26:59.769 --> 27:02.071
Then one day, your Uncle Max said to me,

27:02.105 --> 27:04.087
while I was staring at a brand-new

27:04.120 --> 27:06.935
thousand-dollar bill
for who knows what...

27:09.913 --> 27:12.374
"Do you want me to handle it?"

27:16.376 --> 27:17.943
I didn't say no.

27:18.455 --> 27:20.342
Daryl James died in that fire.

27:20.377 --> 27:21.942
I know!

27:24.569 --> 27:27.190
How are you gonna get in that
pulpit now and preach, huh?

27:33.240 --> 27:34.806
I don't preach perfection, Gigi.

27:34.839 --> 27:36.278
I never have.

27:38.471 --> 27:39.557
I preach grace.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.939
And if the Lord sees fit

27:43.319 --> 27:45.686
to release me from this trial,

27:45.720 --> 27:48.106
I'm gonna go up there next Sunday...

27:49.178 --> 27:51.989
and preach whatever the
Lord gives me to preach.

27:56.856 --> 27:58.709
That's all I can do.

28:09.768 --> 28:10.694
Daddy?

28:24.781 --> 28:26.123
Daddy?

28:31.836 --> 28:33.275
You came?

28:33.329 --> 28:35.052
Of course.

28:36.514 --> 28:38.208
Oh, look at you.

28:39.314 --> 28:42.128
They keep it so hot in here.

28:42.162 --> 28:44.432
Let me just wipe your brow a little bit.

28:44.916 --> 28:47.632
You were always sweet to me.

28:51.295 --> 28:53.118
I need your help, Daddy.

28:55.569 --> 28:58.799
I guess I do owe you something, don't I?

28:59.509 --> 29:01.839
After all I put you through.

29:02.834 --> 29:04.879
Yes, you do.

29:04.913 --> 29:06.256
Yeah.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.015
My little yellow daisy.

29:12.048 --> 29:14.318
Daisy Mae.

29:15.972 --> 29:19.810
You know I never could deny you,

29:19.984 --> 29:22.338
not when you were sweet to me.

29:23.249 --> 29:25.486
And you were sweet to me.

29:28.144 --> 29:29.742
What do you need?

29:53.030 --> 29:54.054
Understood.

29:54.087 --> 29:56.581
<i>The DA has decided
to drop all the charges.</i>

29:56.614 --> 29:59.227
<i>Good luck, Bishop Greenleaf. Thank you.</i>

30:09.734 --> 30:11.971
What did she say?

30:12.534 --> 30:14.079
The DA is dropping the case.

30:16.330 --> 30:18.123
- Completely?
- Yes.

30:19.574 --> 30:22.292
It's really over?

30:22.326 --> 30:24.436
Yes, it's a miracle.

30:24.470 --> 30:26.228
Yes, praise God.

30:26.262 --> 30:30.131
- Yes, praise God.
- Praise God.

30:30.383 --> 30:32.339
What did they say? What happened?

30:32.373 --> 30:35.027
What finally made up their minds?

30:35.061 --> 30:36.918
Your father's refusing to testify.

30:38.550 --> 30:40.947
- All of a sudden?
- Apparently, yes.

30:40.981 --> 30:44.500
Oh... James.

30:44.533 --> 30:47.737
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

30:48.501 --> 30:50.163
Mae. I'm so happy.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.371
- Mae.
- Yeah.

30:52.405 --> 30:54.270
Never again.

30:54.900 --> 30:56.339
What?

30:56.734 --> 30:58.899
I will never lie

30:59.350 --> 31:01.458
or keep anything from you

31:01.731 --> 31:02.817
ever again.

31:02.851 --> 31:04.673
I promise.

31:10.499 --> 31:12.609
Thank you.

31:14.115 --> 31:16.417
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

31:17.954 --> 31:19.417
Oh...

31:20.697 --> 31:22.144
Thank you.

31:23.235 --> 31:24.673
Oh...

31:26.371 --> 31:29.152
Start it off just like that.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.308
Can't start it off just like that.

31:31.341 --> 31:33.355
Why not? Yes, you can.

31:33.389 --> 31:36.556
Then everybody's gonna be saying
it sound like "Dust My Broom."

31:36.590 --> 31:38.668
What do you think you're doing,
reinventing the wheel?

31:38.702 --> 31:40.971
It's the blues.

31:41.006 --> 31:43.248
Stop trying to genius all over the thing

31:43.273 --> 31:44.744
and just write the damn song.

31:45.064 --> 31:46.918
Dinner's ready.

31:52.574 --> 31:54.252
What? Oh, you can't
sit down and eat now?

31:59.318 --> 32:02.227
Don't tell me you went and talked to
that agent from Southern Artists.

32:02.262 --> 32:03.680
No.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.163
I haven't talked to any agents.

32:08.368 --> 32:10.150
Then what's that look all about?

32:10.806 --> 32:12.083
Who you talking to?

32:13.101 --> 32:15.732
Your bishop friend told me
to leave you alone.

32:16.222 --> 32:17.927
I just might do that.

32:30.325 --> 32:32.690
Well, he's perfect. He's just perfect.

32:32.725 --> 32:34.067
Yeah, I know.

32:34.101 --> 32:36.029
We are so blessed.

32:36.415 --> 32:38.077
He's kind of hot, right?

32:38.356 --> 32:40.082
He's no Isaiah Hambrick.

32:40.116 --> 32:42.098
Who's Isaiah Hambrick?

32:42.132 --> 32:44.306
Who's Isaiah Hambrick?

32:46.963 --> 32:48.818
Is that boy moving back in?

32:48.852 --> 32:50.193
Well, not that I've heard,

32:50.227 --> 32:53.169
but I can take night shifts
with the baby.

32:53.203 --> 32:54.544
That's not why I asked.

32:54.579 --> 32:55.953
Mmm.

32:55.987 --> 32:57.361
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm?

32:57.395 --> 32:59.313
There's someone at the gate, ma'am.

32:59.346 --> 33:02.705
Oh, I'm sure it's more flowers
from my family friends.

33:02.739 --> 33:05.681
Just buzz them in. Buzz them in.

33:09.202 --> 33:10.897
So beautiful.

33:10.931 --> 33:12.913
So, I see Maricel's still on the island.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.800
I told you!

33:14.835 --> 33:17.680
And she informed me that today is St.
Catherine's day.

33:17.715 --> 33:20.632
Oh, it's just so hilariously arcane.

33:22.151 --> 33:23.077
Pop?

33:27.605 --> 33:30.356
James, acknowledge your son.

33:30.951 --> 33:34.611
Unless he's come to apologize,
what is there to acknowledge?

33:34.645 --> 33:36.116
Really?

33:37.365 --> 33:39.964
Ma, Pop, we're moving out.

33:40.058 --> 33:42.775
- That's wonderful news, son.
- James.

33:42.810 --> 33:45.368
A man's not a man until
he provides for his own.

33:45.401 --> 33:47.128
- I think it's time.
- No, you can't.

33:47.162 --> 33:48.568
Don't do that, no.

33:48.602 --> 33:50.647
It's all right, all right? Don't worry.

33:50.681 --> 33:52.344
Triumph has a parsonage

33:52.377 --> 33:54.104
and Kerissa's going to go
check it out this week.

33:54.137 --> 33:56.054
No, now just stop, both of y'all.

33:56.089 --> 33:57.303
Just wait, now.

33:57.338 --> 33:58.999
Son, I know you're not gonna darken

33:59.033 --> 34:01.495
the clearest sky
this family's seen in ages

34:01.530 --> 34:02.678
with a cloud like that.

34:02.713 --> 34:04.694
It sounds like he's made up his mind.

34:04.729 --> 34:05.880
Aunt Mavis?

34:05.913 --> 34:07.415
Jesus, build a fence.

34:07.449 --> 34:08.471
Auntie, you all right?

34:08.505 --> 34:09.591
What's going on?

34:09.625 --> 34:11.128
- You!
- What are you doing here?

34:11.161 --> 34:12.630
Stay the hell out of my
business, you hear me?

34:12.664 --> 34:13.942
I was trying to help.

34:13.976 --> 34:15.831
I told you he was not the problem.

34:15.864 --> 34:17.846
You think you know more about
my life now than I do?

34:17.880 --> 34:19.862
- Do you?
- What the hell is she talking about?

34:19.896 --> 34:22.485
Or do you just wanna make sure nobody
else gets what you can't have?

34:22.510 --> 34:24.205
Maricel, call the police.

34:24.237 --> 34:26.956
No need to call the police. I'm going.

34:26.991 --> 34:30.060
I just came to have my peace,
to say what I had to say.

34:30.094 --> 34:32.300
And I'm really sorry if I'm
ruining it for everybody.

34:32.333 --> 34:35.628
If I do, you just do what
you do best, Sister Mae.

34:35.661 --> 34:37.178
You just look away.

34:37.212 --> 34:38.539
You get out of my house right now.

34:38.572 --> 34:40.300
'Cause every night your mama

34:40.333 --> 34:42.571
watched my mama beat my ass

34:42.606 --> 34:46.251
while your mama stood by
and looked the other way.

34:46.286 --> 34:47.884
Well, you had your hell and I had mine.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.443
Some hell! Brand-new
dresses all the time,

34:50.476 --> 34:53.533
going to Nashville with Daddy...

34:53.567 --> 34:55.563
Get out! I want you
to get out of my house...

34:55.597 --> 34:57.547
While I was sleeping out in the shed!

34:57.581 --> 34:58.891
You get out of my house right now!

34:58.926 --> 35:00.523
Oh, some hell. Some hell.

35:00.557 --> 35:03.211
And she knew the whole time
about Mac and Faith.

35:03.245 --> 35:06.874
- Mama?
- She had to know. She knew.

35:06.902 --> 35:08.084
Get out!

35:08.118 --> 35:10.548
Just admit it, Mae. Just admit it.

35:10.582 --> 35:12.404
Admit what? Would you
get her out of here?

35:12.439 --> 35:14.357
- You knew!
- I know you're drunk!

35:14.390 --> 35:16.885
- Just admit it!
- I know you're high!

35:16.918 --> 35:18.868
That's what I know! Just get her out!

35:18.903 --> 35:22.484
Auntie, would you wait, please?

35:22.518 --> 35:24.305
Come on, wait. Hold on.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.132
Can't. On my way to St. Louis.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.244
Why? Alonzo's playing there tonight

35:28.278 --> 35:30.932
and I got to catch up with that boy
and try to talk some sense into him.

35:30.965 --> 35:33.764
Look, I'm worried about you.

35:35.446 --> 35:37.332
Don't.

35:38.029 --> 35:39.571
Please.

35:40.044 --> 35:41.500
Just let me be.

35:44.546 --> 35:46.144
Leave me be!

35:49.416 --> 35:51.109
Leave me be, now.

35:51.636 --> 35:52.934
What the hell is this about?

35:52.967 --> 35:54.245
Nothing.

35:55.079 --> 35:57.445
I encouraged a bad influence
to let your sister be.

35:57.478 --> 35:59.589
- When?
- The other day. What does it matter?

35:59.623 --> 36:01.861
I can't believe you did that to me.

36:01.895 --> 36:03.525
Mae, put yourself aside for once.

36:03.559 --> 36:05.093
Put myself aside?

36:05.127 --> 36:06.916
She's sick! She needs help.

36:06.951 --> 36:10.308
Do you know why my father
refused to testify?

36:10.342 --> 36:13.989
Do you really think that God
arranged for that miracle?

36:14.014 --> 36:15.740
No, I went to him.

36:15.765 --> 36:18.692
I went to that foul, old creature

36:18.727 --> 36:20.964
and asked him to say he acted alone.

36:21.408 --> 36:22.974
Put myself aside?

36:23.009 --> 36:24.255
With everything I've done for you,

36:24.288 --> 36:26.015
there is nothing left.

36:43.055 --> 36:44.653
Good riddance.

36:45.892 --> 36:47.395
Did you know, Mama?

36:47.956 --> 36:49.650
I didn't know.

36:51.657 --> 36:53.868
I'm sorry I never knew.

37:01.101 --> 37:02.567
Think she'll be back?

37:02.601 --> 37:04.551
Oh, she'll be back.

37:04.584 --> 37:05.831
How do you know?

37:08.325 --> 37:09.668
She's family.

37:14.140 --> 37:15.673
Mm-hmm.

38:14.346 --> 38:16.711
Amen!

38:18.857 --> 38:20.519
Amen!

38:22.761 --> 38:25.383
Is there anything

38:25.417 --> 38:27.495
that God can't do?

38:29.857 --> 38:31.647
There is nothing

38:31.681 --> 38:33.855
our God can't do!

38:35.136 --> 38:37.407
Hallelujah!

38:38.127 --> 38:40.012
Hallelujah!

38:42.295 --> 38:44.820
<i>There is nothing</i>

38:44.854 --> 38:47.828
<i>that our God can't do!</i>

38:52.656 --> 38:55.181
Must be nice going straight
from the papers to the pulpit

38:55.215 --> 38:57.165
without skipping a beat.

38:57.199 --> 38:59.117
Shameless.

38:59.151 --> 39:02.476
Pastor Skanks, shouldn't you be
downtown tending your flock?

39:02.511 --> 39:05.933
Or is that circus you got across
the street up and running already?

39:07.599 --> 39:09.635
I thought I smelled something.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.382
Oh, my boy Jacob covered for me

39:11.416 --> 39:13.398
so I could come deliver
a message personally.

39:15.031 --> 39:17.494
I assume it's not one
of mutual edification.

39:17.527 --> 39:19.445
That would be biblical.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.046
Not really your style.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.541
So you want to talk about the Bible?

39:23.575 --> 39:25.638
Let's talk about commandments.

39:25.698 --> 39:27.200
What's your message, boy?

39:27.234 --> 39:28.671
You're going down.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.896
I'm gonna pull you like a weed

39:31.929 --> 39:34.807
and throw you onto God's fire
where you belong.

39:37.893 --> 39:39.620
What do you have against me?

39:42.873 --> 39:44.919
You don't know?

39:45.792 --> 39:47.199
You killed my daddy.

39:51.069 --> 39:52.987
You're Daryl James' boy?

39:53.021 --> 39:54.426
I am.

40:01.724 --> 40:04.955
And by the time I'm done
with you, Bishop,

40:04.988 --> 40:08.314
the only thing that's gonna
rise to heaven from this church

40:09.060 --> 40:10.499
is smoke.

40:14.394 --> 40:16.440
Get ready.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.545
The Judgement's coming.
