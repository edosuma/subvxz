WEBVTT

00:06.381 --> 00:08.008
[upbeat music playing]

00:09.467 --> 00:11.136
No way.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.178
[exclaiming]

00:13.805 --> 00:14.848
[Taylor] You're kidding.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.182
[Sara] Yay.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.142
I'm gonna die.

00:21.271 --> 00:25.942
Bakineers, are you ready to discover
who lurks in the shadows for this mission?

00:26.026 --> 00:27.444
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:27.527 --> 00:28.403
Behold.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.989
[cheering, laughing]

00:35.285 --> 00:37.787
-Say hello to your former competitors.
-[Taylor] Oh God!

00:37.871 --> 00:40.123
[Justin] They’re bakers,
they’re engineers.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.042
[all cheering]

00:50.258 --> 00:52.260
Bakineers, today’s mission is

00:52.343 --> 00:56.389
the first ever
Baking Impossible fashion show.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.726
And these bakineers right here,
they'll be your models.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.311
-Ooh!
-[Sara laughs]

01:02.312 --> 01:04.647
But it won't just be any fashion show.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.732
It will be…

01:07.650 --> 01:09.986
a costume party on the runway.

01:10.070 --> 01:14.282
And in case you haven't guessed,
those costumes will be made of…

01:14.991 --> 01:16.659
-[contestants exclaim]
-[Justin] Mmm.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.120
…something sweet and delicious.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.248
Your mission today will be
to create edible outfits

01:22.332 --> 01:23.833
for a costume party,

01:23.917 --> 01:26.836
and your models will have to
walk the runway.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.421
Ooh!

01:29.005 --> 01:33.551
In the last mission, Steve and Renee,
you had the winning miniature golf hole,

01:33.635 --> 01:35.845
so you’ll get a massive boost
for this mission.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.641
You will get first pick
of your bakineer model,

01:39.724 --> 01:43.436
and that person will also be able
to help you with your bake and build

01:43.520 --> 01:45.146
for three hours.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.607
Wow.

01:47.690 --> 01:50.026
[Justin] You just let us know
when you want us to launch

01:50.110 --> 01:51.277
that three-hour clock.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.947
For the rest of you,
your model's only job will be

01:54.030 --> 01:57.075
to wear your edible costume
in the stress test fashion show.

01:57.158 --> 02:00.954
Steve and Renee, you have a big,
strategic decision to make here.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.289
You'll pick a baker or an engineer.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.916
It's completely up to you.

02:08.753 --> 02:09.629
-Okay.
-Yeah.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.715
-Who do you choose as your model?
-Vanessa.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.471
Hi.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.389
Hey.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.308
Now it's time for the rest of you

02:22.392 --> 02:24.727
to find out
which models you're going to get.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.020
-Justin?
-Yes, sir.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.439
-Please do the honors.
-I would be honored to. Okay.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.983
We'll just do this at random.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.862
Rodolfo and Sara,
your model will be Edwin.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.407
Cindy and Taylor? Hannah.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.575
-Yeah!
-Yay!

02:38.658 --> 02:39.826
Hi, guys!

02:40.660 --> 02:43.204
Brandi and Menuka, Sierra.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.455
-Yay!
-Oh!

02:44.539 --> 02:46.457
That means Randi and Jacob, Shanice!

02:46.541 --> 02:47.667
[cheering]

02:50.920 --> 02:53.965
Bakineers, you will have 14 hours

02:54.048 --> 02:57.093
until your designs have to be
runway-ready.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.553
Teams, hittin' it.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.555
All right.

03:00.638 --> 03:04.559
[woman] Mission launch in three, two, one.

03:04.642 --> 03:05.727
-Go.
-Go.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.145
[clock ticking]

03:09.355 --> 03:11.357
-All right.
-Oh, my God. I'm so happy you're here!

03:11.441 --> 03:12.734
I can't believe you're here!

03:12.817 --> 03:14.527
-I'm so excited.
-Oh, my God.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.529
-Excited to have you here, man.
-Okay.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.072
All right.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.325
We need to make an edible costume.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.576
[Taylor] One human model.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.494
[Randi] Four engineered confections.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.788
-[Jacob] That's our dessert.
-That's our dessert.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.332
[Menuka] Forty feet is pretty long.

03:27.415 --> 03:31.586
[Taylor] Model walks in edible costume,
and costume must serve judges.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.465
We have a perfect model
for a cyborg samurai.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.382
[Edwin] I love it.

03:36.466 --> 03:40.053
-You ever seen cuckoo clocks before?
-That would be cute.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.222
You are a raspberry.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.933
-No way! [laughing]
-You are a raspberry.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.935
This is the first ever

03:47.018 --> 03:50.230
Baking Impossible costume party.
What are you looking for today?

03:50.313 --> 03:55.235
These remaining five bakineer teams have
to create an edible engineered costume.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.780
Ingenuity and creativity
are really the name of this brief.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.282
I look forward to seeing
something we haven't before.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.994
-It has to be flexible.
-Yeah, like fruit leather or something.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.830
Wow! What made you think of that?
That's cool, I like that.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.749
I don't know, it just popped in my head.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.626
From an engineering perspective,

04:11.709 --> 04:14.045
this is really tough.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.714
What they create is gonna have to survive

04:16.798 --> 04:18.216
walking down the runway,

04:18.299 --> 04:20.969
and that's a lot of wear and tear
on edible clothing.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.097
But on top of that,
looking good isn't enough.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.976
These costumes are gonna have to
incorporate an engineering function

04:28.059 --> 04:30.645
that will somehow
serve us their confection.

04:30.728 --> 04:34.315
So, in many ways,
it's a materials engineering problem.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.985
This is gonna be a tough mission.

04:37.694 --> 04:41.739
For the engineering,
I can actually make butterflies.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.242
I mean, I can make robotic butterflies.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.287
That would be awesome,
because I'm a robotic engineer.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.330
-It's what I should do.
-That'd be gorgeous.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.667
Cover the whole body in pasta
with beads and wire.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.378
-And then maybe go like--
-How about, like, a steampunk--

04:55.461 --> 04:57.213
Yeah, with wires? Play it up?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.631
[Steve] The edible portion,

04:58.715 --> 05:02.135
how about we do a dark chocolate ganache

05:02.218 --> 05:03.344
with Grand Marnier?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.387
Okay.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.390
I love this mission.
Can't wait to see what they come up with.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.435
They have to execute their costume concept

05:10.518 --> 05:13.479
using exquisite, edible ingredients,

05:13.563 --> 05:16.316
and they have to present to us
amazing confections

05:16.399 --> 05:20.153
that are somehow incorporated in the
design. We're on the fifth mission,

05:20.236 --> 05:22.739
and I think this is
the most challenging one yet

05:22.822 --> 05:24.240
from a culinary perspective.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.658
Maybe the fruit,

05:25.742 --> 05:29.787
not necessarily look like
a fruit you've ever seen before.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.541
Like enchanted forest.
What would be good for that is a macaron.

05:33.624 --> 05:37.462
-[Menuka] Macaron would be nice.
-A macaron with a passion fruit filling.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.673
I'm thinking we do--
We need something that's got that shape.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.509
Let's see when we play
with the fruit if they hold the shape.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.804
I'm thinking a puff pastry
with raspberry and cream cheese.

05:46.888 --> 05:47.722
Ooh.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.599
Get to baking, you get to building.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.808
See you shortly.

05:50.892 --> 05:51.768
One, two, three.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.853
-Yay!
-Okay, bye-bye.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.688
[clock ticking]

05:57.357 --> 06:00.068
-So if we could do 20 inches…
-That's perfect.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.320
What are you trying to do to Edwin?
Poor Edwin.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.905
You're gonna walk into the store,

06:03.988 --> 06:06.991
"I need a watermelon that's exactly
the same shape as this guy's head."

06:07.075 --> 06:08.409
[laughing]

06:09.660 --> 06:11.788
-We can do your neck, for the necklace.
-Yeah.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.125
[Taylor] Oh, that's an awesome color.
So awesome.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.379
[Sara] What do you think
they're doing with those?

06:19.462 --> 06:22.215
-I have no idea.
-[Cindy] I feel like a scientist.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.967
[Taylor] You are a scientist.
You're hydrating gelatin.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.135
Yeah.

06:26.219 --> 06:30.139
We wanna build something
that screams, "I am fashion."

06:30.223 --> 06:32.225
Something so out there.

06:33.017 --> 06:36.479
For this mission,
Cindy and I are making an edible costume

06:36.562 --> 06:38.564
that is a raspberry dress,

06:38.648 --> 06:40.942
made of 100% gelatin.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.946
You got a leaf headband,
to the stem collar,

06:45.029 --> 06:47.031
to the drupelets
that go down to the waist,

06:47.115 --> 06:49.492
the shoes with little raspberry leaves.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.953
We've got the handbag and matching ring.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.831
From head to toe, it's all gelatin.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.417
That's so cool.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.376
[Cindy laughs]

06:59.961 --> 07:03.131
Our pastry is located
inside the raspberry's drupelets,

07:03.214 --> 07:06.509
and when it's time to present the dessert,
those drupelets will light up,

07:06.592 --> 07:09.679
and then we can reach inside
and present them to the judges.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.806
[Cindy] My dessert is a puff pastry

07:11.889 --> 07:13.808
with cream cheese
baked in the middle,

07:13.891 --> 07:15.017
with a raspberry on top.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.062
-[Taylor] We're gonna blow their minds.
-[Cindy] I'm really excited.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.981
I want people to be like,

07:20.064 --> 07:22.275
"I need that costume
for Halloween this year."

07:22.358 --> 07:24.193
When people say, "Oh, fashion?"

07:24.277 --> 07:26.529
-They'll think Cindy and--
-They'll think Cindy.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.076
Okay, I'm gonna go experiment
with laser cutting gelatin.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.037
-Laser cutting gelatin?
-Yeah, to make a purse.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.999
-That looks beautiful.
-Right? Won't this be a gorgeous purse?

07:38.082 --> 07:39.375
[clock ticking]

07:39.459 --> 07:41.461
[upbeat music playing]

07:48.468 --> 07:49.677
Solidly a purse.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.264
I just feel like
it should be smaller at the bottom.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.307
[Jacob] Just the bottom?

07:54.390 --> 07:57.935
Because remember, you're gonna have
a skirt coming out, and--

07:59.103 --> 08:01.272
Girls like to show off their figure.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.649
Where did you learn to do that?

08:03.733 --> 08:07.111
My mom makes some jewelry,
my aunt makes some jewelry,

08:07.195 --> 08:09.822
so I'm trying to use the same techniques.

08:09.906 --> 08:10.823
That's great.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.575
What do you think?

08:15.203 --> 08:17.663
-Hello, Rodolfo and Sara.
-Hello, guys.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.457
-How's it going?
-How you doing?

08:19.540 --> 08:23.377
Which costume are you making
for the Baking Impossible costume party?

08:23.461 --> 08:26.255
Talk us through the various elements
that you're making.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.635
We're going for a samurai cyborg barista.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.012
That's three very different things.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.931
It's a lot of melding going on.

08:35.014 --> 08:39.227
I'm making a covering,
so I've got a lot of rigatoni right now.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.396
And so, we're going to be starting
with kind of a chain mail weave,

08:42.480 --> 08:45.024
that we're going to attach some armor,

08:45.107 --> 08:47.610
which will be made
of different types of fruits

08:47.693 --> 08:51.239
with an awesome headpiece helmet as well,
made of a watermelon.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.992
[Rodolfo] So, for the dessert,
I'm thinking to do a chocolate shell

08:55.076 --> 08:58.246
with a mousseline coffee flavor

08:58.329 --> 09:00.581
and a sea salt,
chocolate chip cookie on top,

09:00.665 --> 09:02.291
and a lot of cookie crumbs.

09:02.375 --> 09:06.712
So how are you engineering
your presentation today?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.923
Our engineered function
is actually gonna be

09:09.006 --> 09:12.218
a whipped cream container
that's constructed into the back,

09:12.301 --> 09:17.181
and operate the whipped cream container
with a whipped cream arm for the top.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.140
On the dessert.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.894
We're having the hydraulic piece come
down through here, and into the back.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.938
You're doing hydraulics
going all the way--

09:24.021 --> 09:26.274
-That's right.
-That's quite bold.

09:26.357 --> 09:30.695
-Hopefully no cream explosions.
-Hopefully no, not too many explosions.

09:31.529 --> 09:35.449
We're playing a little bit with magnets
as a part of our presentation as well.

09:35.533 --> 09:39.370
Are you confident you'll be able to attach
everything well, that side of engineering?

09:39.453 --> 09:40.705
-Absolutely.
-Best of luck.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.956
-Wonderful.
-Thanks very much.

09:42.039 --> 09:42.957
Bye-bye.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.667
[clock ticking]

09:45.626 --> 09:48.254
[Randi] This is our fruit leather.
It's so pretty.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.427
Damn, passion fruit.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.762
Let me just get this in here
before it sets.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.680
[Renee] So good.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.433
Hello, Steve, Renee.

10:00.516 --> 10:03.227
Hi, Steve.
Are you on a high from your big win?

10:03.311 --> 10:04.812
-Uh, absolutely.
-Yeah?

10:04.895 --> 10:06.355
Oh, yeah.
It was a great win to have,

10:06.439 --> 10:09.817
and having Vanessa on our team
is gonna take us to a different level.

10:10.443 --> 10:15.281
-So, what is your costume?
-She's a sassy, like, underworld--

10:15.364 --> 10:17.199
But enough about Renee.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.203
Literally, it's, like,
about me, which is kind of sad.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.913
This is a two-piece costume,

10:22.997 --> 10:25.124
which is basically a corset and tutu

10:25.207 --> 10:29.211
made of isomalt, fondant and gumpaste.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.881
Like gothic,
underworld type of fairy. Badass.

10:31.964 --> 10:35.134
She'll have an isomalt five-foot staff,
and a dagger, and--

10:35.217 --> 10:37.386
-You're kidding.
-An isomalt five-foot staff?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.055
-It's gonna be a group effort.
-Wow.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.932
I've never done it before,
so my hands will burn from isomalt.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.184
-Yeah.
-But that's okay.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.519
[Joanne] Tell us about the dessert
that you'll be making.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.564
[Steve] Candied orange with Grand Marnier
and a hint of cayenne,

10:48.648 --> 10:51.317
and then we have
an outer shell of couverture,

10:51.400 --> 10:53.361
which has been toned down
with cocoa butter.

10:53.444 --> 10:56.822
Coating of hazelnut feuilletine
back to it. Then it'll be decorated on top

10:56.906 --> 10:58.991
with some candied orange
and a little sea salt.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.619
Sounds incredibly ambitious.
Can't wait to see the staff.

11:01.702 --> 11:02.620
-Thanks.
-Good luck.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.914
I'll be a magician.
Gonna pull it out of nowhere.

11:04.997 --> 11:08.751
[Justin] Bakineers, eight hours left.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.419
[electropop music playing]

11:16.384 --> 11:18.344
We're making a giant raspberry.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.554
Ah! That's cool.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.722
How about you?

11:21.806 --> 11:24.058
-We're building a tree.
-[Taylor] A tree?

11:25.309 --> 11:26.811
[whirring]

11:27.395 --> 11:29.063
-Menuka, come look.
-[gasps]

11:30.189 --> 11:31.315
Holy moly.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.734
Wow.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.571
For this mission, we are going to create

11:37.655 --> 11:40.574
an enchanted forest-themed tree

11:40.658 --> 11:43.202
made of a brown marbled fondant.

11:43.285 --> 11:47.498
I'm going to lay rice paper
over top to make it crack

11:47.581 --> 11:49.500
to really look like tree bark.

11:49.583 --> 11:54.714
The branches will be made out of wires
covered with dark chocolate.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.257
That looks really good, Menuka.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.467
-Yeah, that looks really good.
-It's strong too.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.721
[Brandi] We'll also have
some really bright pink,

12:01.804 --> 12:03.556
wafer paper flowers,

12:03.639 --> 12:05.182
and then inside will be

12:05.266 --> 12:08.394
a raspberry dusted macaron

12:08.477 --> 12:10.438
with a passion fruit filling.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.941
We will clip the branch
to serve the judges,

12:14.024 --> 12:16.569
and then adorning her branches,

12:16.652 --> 12:18.779
Menuka's amazing butterflies

12:18.863 --> 12:20.156
fluttering around.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.158
-I'm making the butterfly right now.
-Okay.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.077
I think I'm going to make the wings
out of rice paper.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.162
-Okay.
-Yeah.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.789
I actually designed a backpack

12:28.873 --> 12:33.252
to hold the electronics,
and also support for the tree branches

12:33.335 --> 12:34.628
with the metal wire,

12:34.712 --> 12:39.175
and also wire running through
with those wires to power my butterflies.

12:43.179 --> 12:48.017
I'm over the moon
to show my robotic butterflies.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.686
Ten years ago,
I sent this musical greeting card

12:50.770 --> 12:53.355
to my mom back home, and she's like,

12:53.439 --> 12:56.734
"It's great, but your sister
is asking about the music."

12:56.817 --> 13:00.196
Because my sister is deaf.
So it's given me inspiration,

13:00.279 --> 13:03.449
like I want to make something moving
so she can enjoy it.

13:03.532 --> 13:07.953
That was the moment that I decided
to make animatronic greeting cards.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.790
And after four years I have my own company

13:10.873 --> 13:14.251
and I have the patent for the technology,

13:14.335 --> 13:18.214
and I consider myself
one of the top engineers

13:18.297 --> 13:19.423
working on that field.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.009
Probably making
the most complex electronic

13:22.092 --> 13:23.177
for any fashion show.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.513
[clock ticking]

13:25.596 --> 13:27.181
-Sara?
-Yes.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.225
I'm gonna do some in black,

13:29.308 --> 13:31.644
and a few in pink, for the Mohawk.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.189
[electropop music playing]

13:39.902 --> 13:42.738
-Steve, how's it going over there?
-Not so good.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.365
-Not enough?
-No.

13:44.448 --> 13:48.869
So for me, creating the five-foot staff
from isomalt is a challenge.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.455
Although I know about isomalt,

13:51.539 --> 13:53.958
I really don't work with it that much.

13:54.041 --> 13:57.336
So this is a little bit
of a new area for me to go into.

13:58.087 --> 13:58.921
Oh, wow!

13:59.004 --> 14:01.715
Removing the sugar and pulling it,
adding air into it.

14:01.799 --> 14:05.344
I'm actually managing to pull this,
so I'm, like, stuck.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.848
It's not an area I'm normally in,
but I am now.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.101
So it's a really good feeling
that I'm pushing the edibles on this one,

14:12.184 --> 14:13.561
especially with isomalt.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.605
Steve, I don't even have words.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.608
You literally just made
a five-foot pole of sugar.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.028
It's just an illusion.
Don't worry about it.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.119
-Hey, Justin.
-What's up, Randi?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.788
Hi, Jacob. Look at Jacob's
rolling out gingerbread there.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.040
-[Randi] He's amazing.
-Look what you've done to him.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.585
-I've domesticated him.
-Did you say domestica--

14:37.668 --> 14:39.461
-[Justin] Yeah.
-I domesticated you.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.799
I am an aerospace engineer.
I work on things that fly.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.052
My mom would say I'm a rocket scientist.
She really likes to brag.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.722
Someone'd be like,
"What is your son, a rocket scientist?"

14:49.805 --> 14:52.266
And it's like, "Oh, he actually is."

14:54.101 --> 14:55.311
This is familiar to me.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.979
-Fruit leather.
-Fruit leather.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.523
I've been doing this my whole life,

14:59.607 --> 15:01.442
and I'm completely self-taught.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.777
I was in the financial industry,

15:03.861 --> 15:06.405
and when my daughter was 13 years old,

15:06.488 --> 15:08.532
I decided to get back into baking

15:08.616 --> 15:10.826
and I have never looked back since.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.205
Now I run my business
out of my home kitchen.

15:15.831 --> 15:20.669
I don't have a brick-and-mortar shop,
because when I got back into cakes,

15:20.753 --> 15:22.630
my kids were still young,

15:22.713 --> 15:26.091
and the most important place
for me to be was at home.

15:26.175 --> 15:30.012
I guess I'm doing this for me,
'cause I really worked so hard

15:30.095 --> 15:33.098
for everything
that I've accomplished so far.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.517
And then to be able to accomplish this?

15:36.185 --> 15:37.019
Wow.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.020
What are you making?

15:38.103 --> 15:40.981
This is going to be
the body of a cuckoo clock.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.816
Where does the inspiration come from?

15:42.900 --> 15:45.903
We were thinking of enchanted objects,

15:46.487 --> 15:49.657
where the enchanted objects
were everyday items.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.409
I am really excited about this mission.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.119
We're doing a cuckoo clock

15:54.203 --> 15:56.497
because it's fun,

15:56.580 --> 15:59.291
it's exciting, it's expressive.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.545
I'm making the skirt,
which is wafer paper covered in Flexique.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.173
The body of the clock
is going to be structured

16:06.256 --> 16:08.384
out of PVC covered in fruit leather,

16:08.467 --> 16:11.345
and then on the front
we're gonna have an actual clock face

16:11.428 --> 16:16.141
made out of white chocolate.
When the clock strikes the hour,

16:16.225 --> 16:20.562
the doors on the front of the clock will
actually open up, presenting our dessert.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.066
-And the dessert with this is so spot-on.
-Do I get a hint?

16:24.149 --> 16:26.986
The dessert is
actually a hummingbird cake.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.071
Amazing.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.490
And the hummingbird cake
is a really nice cake

16:31.573 --> 16:33.951
made with pineapples, and bananas,

16:34.034 --> 16:36.078
and cinnamon, and nutmeg, and allspice,

16:36.161 --> 16:39.123
with a delicious, light,
cream cheese frosting.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.918
I'm gonna be molding eggshells
to put the cake inside,

16:43.002 --> 16:45.796
and the eggshells
will be from white tempered chocolate.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.174
-Thanks for stopping by.
-I'm happy-- Happy to stop by.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.468
I'll just-- I'm gonna saunter this way.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.012
-Okay.
-You got it.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.930
-Off I go.
-Saunter back.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.518
[Renee] It's like hazelnut cornflakes,
but lighter.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.854
-That's how you could explain it.
-It's good.

17:01.937 --> 17:02.980
Yikes.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.316
Now, I will remove this tube from you.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.612
The magnets are cute and small.
So it should work great.

17:13.407 --> 17:16.410
And then, when she puts it on,
it's probably gonna be out, and in--

17:16.493 --> 17:18.620
-In between we can add--
-[Taylor] We can cut-- Yeah.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.249
[Justin] Tyra says
just to walk with confidence.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.877
Yeah, you're doin' it.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.755
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.053
Five hours.

17:36.180 --> 17:39.016
-What?
-Justin, you're killing me.

17:39.099 --> 17:44.146
You got this, Justin. Second career.
You got-- Okay, a little slippery there.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.068
[Randi] Jacob, where are you at
with the clock?

17:49.151 --> 17:50.402
What do you have left to do?

17:50.486 --> 17:53.655
Right now I'm attaching the stepper motor.
What do you have to do?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.200
I have to finish covering the cage.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.578
[electropop music playing]

18:04.583 --> 18:06.126
Oh! That didn't work.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.503
[chuckles]

18:09.046 --> 18:10.214
[exclaims]

18:14.468 --> 18:16.595
So, are we ready
to bring Vanessa in right now?

18:16.678 --> 18:18.555
-Yeah, I think we're ready.
-Let's do it.

18:19.139 --> 18:23.393
Justin and judges, I am ready
for my fashion emergency help, please.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.104
-Fashion emergency?
-Yes.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.064
-[mimics siren]
-Vanessa.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.067
-Yeah.
-Yay.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.778
-You guys are awesome!
-[Justin] There she is.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.281
-All right.
-How's it feel to don the apron again?

18:36.365 --> 18:38.700
-I'm glad. Super excited.
-The orange apron.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.787
Okay, you've got three hours
with team Steve and Renee.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.704
Thank you.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.457
So where we're at right now,
I'm finishing up the tutu.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.459
This is what I'll need the most help with.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.046
I cut out different types of leaves,
and we were just gonna airbrush and glue.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.840
-Okay.
-Put it all on, then airbrush--

18:52.923 --> 18:56.176
I think that would be cool,
and then we can Flexique that whole thing.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.345
-Flexique it, like, brush it. Yeah.
-On this?

18:58.428 --> 19:00.889
-And then luster dust it. Perfect.
-Luster dust it.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.976
All right, well,
it's a huge advantage they're getting.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.895
-[Andrew] Doubled the bakers on the team.
-Yeah. True.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.606
What Steve does,
Vanessa knows is not her forte,

19:09.690 --> 19:11.817
and what Vanessa does,
Steve doesn't mess with.

19:11.900 --> 19:12.943
That looks cool.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.572
A team of complementary skills,
is what it sounds like.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.325
[clock ticking]

19:21.660 --> 19:22.494
[Brandi] Perfect.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.373
[Sara] I think
this is gonna come up like this.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.838
-Eight sized, right?
-Eight, yeah.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.925
[Hannah] I love it.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.388
-You like that?
-Yeah. It's not too heavy or anything.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.056
It's cozy, I can still move around.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.642
I love the tail. [laughing]

19:45.726 --> 19:46.810
Yes!

19:52.649 --> 19:54.735
-Sara, Rodolfo, Edwin.
-Hey, Justin.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.486
-Hello.
-How's it going?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.363
What have I strolled into here?

19:58.447 --> 20:01.533
Edwin, I feel like
you can rock any costume.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.535
[Rodolfo and Sara] There we go.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.747
Wow. Something tells me, though,
Edwin's worn a watermelon as a helmet

20:06.830 --> 20:07.789
before today.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.084
Can I see-- Just foreshadow, the prequel,

20:11.168 --> 20:13.128
but show us your fiercest runway look.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.214
[music building]

20:16.590 --> 20:18.425
[music peaks]

20:19.509 --> 20:20.510
[Rodolfo and Sara laugh]

20:20.594 --> 20:22.888
-[Sara] I love it.
-That's pretty good. Okay.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.682
[clock ticking]

20:29.436 --> 20:32.856
-Another guy will go here.
-We'll do a filler. Yeah.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.399
-[Steve] Fire and ice.
-Yes.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.609
All right.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.821
Look at you guys go.
We'll be home for a beer.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.699
-[Rodolfo] Sara.
-Yes, sir.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.577
-I'm gonna start covering the helmet.
-Right on.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.249
Two hours!

20:51.750 --> 20:54.002
Put it straight. Straight on your head.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.963
-How's it going there, girls?
-Good.

20:56.046 --> 20:56.880
Good.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.428
-[Renee] What else could we add?
-That Flexique right there.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.596
So, okay, look.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.016
Let's make Flexique,
like, lay a few of those down.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.186
Hannah will have two pieces of--
To connect, and then this happens.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.229
[Cindy] Wow!

21:12.312 --> 21:13.855
-Love it.
-[Taylor] Yeah, that's awesome.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.565
[Cindy] Those lights are cool.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.194
[Renee] She's teaching how to do Flexique.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.698
So, if you need to add
anything extra along the top,

21:22.781 --> 21:24.700
you can literally throw these in there.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.327
-Okay. Good for that.
-Are you teaching him Flexique?

21:27.411 --> 21:28.745
-Yeah.
-Sweet. Okay.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.206
Steve and Renee,
your three-hour advantage time

21:31.290 --> 21:34.376
with Vanessa is up.
You're back to being a duo.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.378
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.421
Bye.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.506
High five, Steve.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.508
[clock ticking]

21:41.591 --> 21:44.094
Teams, one hour left.

21:44.177 --> 21:45.929
-Yeah.
-Oh! It's dripping.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.809
You're working too slow, Jacob.
Come on. I got stuff to do.

21:51.518 --> 21:54.229
-I don't wanna screw this up.
-You're not gonna screw it up.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.565
[Steve] I don't know why
it's going in the same direction.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.109
Instead, they should both go
in the opposite direction.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.444
Yeah, it's flipped,

22:00.527 --> 22:04.990
so I'm wondering why I didn't see
that they were in the same direction.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.993
I don't want to break the pasta, though.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.037
-Might wanna do it at the end.
-It's fine.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.581
If we could put one more here,
it would do a lot.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.540
Yeah. Totally.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.756
-Can you imagine if we frickin' win?
-[Menuka] Right?

22:20.839 --> 22:22.924
We took such a huge gamble too.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.012
[Justin] All right, bakineers, your judges
are heading off to get the runway ready.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.140
You have 15 minutes left.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.062
[Renee] I need these to dry
before I can hot glue 'em on.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.232
I like this.
I've never put electronics in a dress.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.237
-[Rodolfo] I'm gonna airbrush everything.
-[Sara] Good idea.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.239
Five minutes.

22:46.823 --> 22:47.949
Hurry, Menuka.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.203
All right. I am pumped.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.830
-Welcome to your piece.
-Sweet!

22:57.042 --> 22:59.252
Over there. In the bin. Right there.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.925
-[Rodolfo] Gonna bring the desserts.
-Please work.

23:07.010 --> 23:07.969
[gasps]

23:08.053 --> 23:09.930
Oh, my God, I love it.

23:10.889 --> 23:16.186
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

23:16.269 --> 23:21.733
five, four, three, two, one.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.318
Time is up.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.029
Needles and nougat down.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.781
[Sierra speaking indistinctly]

23:29.991 --> 23:31.201
Oh, God.

23:32.786 --> 23:36.206
Bakineers, are you ready
to walk the red carpet?

23:36.289 --> 23:37.999
-[Jacob] Yeah.
-'Cause I brought one.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.045
Join me, come on.
I wanna see what you got.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.131
Menuka, what are you working with?

23:44.214 --> 23:46.007
-Yeah, Menuka.
-[contestants] Yeah!

23:46.091 --> 23:47.217
Nice strut. Yeah.

23:48.301 --> 23:49.428
Well done.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.387
Nice!

23:52.180 --> 23:54.182
[contestants cheering]

23:58.562 --> 23:59.479
Well done!

23:59.563 --> 24:04.484
All right, bakineers, are you ready to see
where the fashion magic is gonna happen?

24:04.568 --> 24:05.652
-[Taylor] Yes!
-[Jacob] Yeah!

24:08.196 --> 24:09.531
[contestants exclaiming]

24:10.198 --> 24:13.118
Wow. That looks slippery.

24:13.618 --> 24:14.661
[Sara] That's cool.

24:16.079 --> 24:17.497
Head on in. Check it out.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.708
[dramatic music playing]

24:26.465 --> 24:28.175
Welcome, bakineers,

24:28.258 --> 24:31.845
to the Baking Impossible
costume party fashion show.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.930
For your Baking Impossible stress test,

24:34.014 --> 24:36.141
each of your bakineer models
will have to wear

24:36.224 --> 24:39.019
the ingenious,
edible costumes you've created,

24:39.102 --> 24:43.023
walk them down the runway,
and serve up your delicious confections.

24:43.773 --> 24:47.444
Any fashion failure could result
in an actual fail in this mission.

24:48.069 --> 24:51.948
And, as you know, if you win this mission,
you'll earn a big boost in the next one.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.411
Are we ready
for some costumed cake craziness?

24:56.495 --> 24:57.746
-Hell yeah.
-[Jacob] Let's do it.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.582
First up on the runway, Steve and Renee.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.209
-The runway is yours.
-[Menuka] Yes.

25:03.293 --> 25:07.589
Please welcome to the stage
Steve and Renee's model, Vanessa.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.219
[Justin laughs]

25:15.639 --> 25:17.224
[electropop music playing]

25:17.307 --> 25:18.433
[Taylor] Yeah!

25:19.768 --> 25:21.311
Work it!

25:25.065 --> 25:26.066
[cheering]

25:29.110 --> 25:30.820
Oh, my gosh.

25:30.904 --> 25:36.034
[Renee] This is Strenessa,
an awesome, beautiful leader queen

25:36.117 --> 25:37.619
of the fairy underworld.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.955
A strong, powerful leader.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.875
-That's impressive.
-I don't like that dagger pointing at me.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.796
The edibles?
Well, this is a two-piece costume.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.881
The corset is Flexique,

25:49.965 --> 25:53.677
isomalt, fondant and gumpaste roses.

25:53.760 --> 25:57.180
The tutu is edible rice paper product.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.433
-See the sugar work on the shoes?
-Oh, yeah.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.018
[Steve] The headdress is isomalt,

26:02.102 --> 26:05.480
the necklace being red licorice
woven into a choker.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.856
-Look at the headdress.
-Wow.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.068
[Steve] We have an isomalt staff.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.321
Staff. That's really nice.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.823
[Steve] We have an isomalt dagger.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.616
That dagger could kill a man.

26:18.868 --> 26:21.621
[Steve] The wings on the back
are made of wafer paper,

26:21.705 --> 26:23.123
and they're mechanical.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.004
There is a circuit in the back

26:29.087 --> 26:31.715
that has two servos
that are running the wings.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.217
Can we see the wings in their full glory?

26:38.054 --> 26:39.681
[dramatic music playing]

26:48.940 --> 26:50.942
-Thank you, Vanessa.
-Great.

26:51.568 --> 26:54.029
All right, Steve and Renee,
serve us your confection.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.781
So it's a simple latch mechanism.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.868
I pull out the pin,
and out come the desserts.

26:59.951 --> 27:00.869
Wow.

27:00.952 --> 27:05.123
[Steve] One. Two.
And I'm gonna close up the box.

27:05.206 --> 27:08.001
-The best fanny pack I've ever seen.
-And you can eat it.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.213
Here we have a ganache-filled,
hazelnut praline,

27:12.297 --> 27:13.715
milk chocolate feuilletine,

27:13.798 --> 27:16.509
dark chocolate ganache
with a little spice in it,

27:16.593 --> 27:18.928
and then that is encased
in a white chocolate shell.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.680
[Andrew] There it goes.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.767
And a little touch of sea salt
to cut the sweetness.

27:23.850 --> 27:27.562
Steve, you have presented us
with a stunning confection.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.731
-Really delicious.
-Thank you.

27:29.814 --> 27:33.735
The ganache is well-emulsified and smooth.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.655
But unfortunately,
it does have a very thick outer shell.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.948
Yes, it could be thinner. I agree 100%.

27:39.032 --> 27:43.703
The shell makes it just hard to enjoy
in the way that I think you'd want us to.

27:43.787 --> 27:44.663
Mmm-hmm.

27:44.746 --> 27:49.084
Steve and Renee. I wish that the motion
of the wings had been more pronounced.

27:49.167 --> 27:53.171
You know, they were in sync,
but the wings moved in a strange way

27:53.254 --> 27:55.256
due to some faulty programming.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.300
But I absolutely loved

27:57.384 --> 27:59.886
your beautiful box or purse,

27:59.969 --> 28:03.181
and you had that locking mechanism,
I thought that was ingenious.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.642
It was very simple, it was very secure.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.810
Wonderful job.

28:08.061 --> 28:12.816
Steve and Renee, your outfit was
straight out of a fantasy fashion show.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.776
It was utterly enchanting.

28:14.859 --> 28:18.279
Steve, in previous missions we've seen
your fantastic chocolate work,

28:18.363 --> 28:23.201
so it was a delight today to see
your isomalt intricacies on full display.

28:23.284 --> 28:26.246
That five-foot isomalt staff
that you created, amazing.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.000
You were working really well
to get that wafer paper detailing done,

28:31.084 --> 28:33.753
and I thought
the end result was really spectacular.

28:33.837 --> 28:34.796
Thank you.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.715
Thank you so much. Well done.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.925
Rodolfo and Sara,

28:39.008 --> 28:41.094
it's your turn on the runway. Come on up.

28:47.350 --> 28:51.312
Please give it up
for Rodolfo and Sara's model, Edwin.

28:54.357 --> 28:55.483
[contestants cheering]

29:00.613 --> 29:01.948
This is amazing.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.203
[Justin] I don't think
I've seen Edwin so serious.

29:07.287 --> 29:11.374
[Sara] Edwin is
our samurai cyborg barista.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.669
-Looking great!
-Yeah.

29:15.253 --> 29:19.257
[Sara] We have some of the armor
in pineapple, as well as his corset.

29:19.340 --> 29:22.177
We've got a lot
of different kinds of pasta as beads.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.012
-[Joanne] Look at--
-Shin guards?

29:24.095 --> 29:25.847
-The shin guards.
-Yeah.

29:25.930 --> 29:29.225
[Sara] Got a watermelon helmet
covered in fondant.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.603
-Look at that helmet.
-[Dr. O] Wow.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.855
[Justin] What're the spikes made of?

29:33.938 --> 29:34.939
Candele pasta.

29:35.023 --> 29:35.940
Candele pasta, yeah.

29:36.024 --> 29:36.858
And the flags?

29:36.941 --> 29:38.401
[Rodolfo] Wafer paper.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.029
Oh!

29:41.613 --> 29:43.448
-[Joanne] Unbelievable.
-[Justin] Wow.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.033
[Joanne] Wow. [chuckles]

29:46.159 --> 29:47.076
Work it.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.205
I love the cyborg and the samurai.

29:50.288 --> 29:54.125
Let's see the barista part in action.
Serve up these confections.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.253
[Sara] The dessert, it's going to be
in an inside-out cantaloupe

29:57.337 --> 29:58.922
that we've attached to the kilt.

30:05.553 --> 30:06.888
[tense music playing]

30:09.641 --> 30:11.309
[all laughing]

30:13.144 --> 30:14.479
[applause]

30:22.529 --> 30:27.200
I did a sea salt, chocolate chip cookie
with four kinds of chocolate,

30:27.951 --> 30:29.577
with coffee mousseline,

30:29.661 --> 30:33.081
and on the layers I have cookie crumbs.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.500
Rodolfo, this cookie was scrumptious.

30:35.583 --> 30:39.045
I like the tempered chocolate shell.
It's really well done.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.506
It's not thick, it's easy to break into.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.259
The mousseline seems
a little broken to me.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.177
It's a little bit rough.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.097
And, typically, when I think mousseline,
I do think creamy.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.640
I think I overmixed a little.

30:50.723 --> 30:52.350
-Was it overmixed?
-Yeah.

30:52.433 --> 30:56.104
Usually, Rodolfo, I see you
during these missions busy baking,

30:56.187 --> 30:57.397
or working with chocolate,

30:57.480 --> 31:01.276
or doing something
to showcase your pastry skills,

31:01.359 --> 31:04.112
and in this mission,
I didn't see that quite as much.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.949
I feel like you guys did a great job
on your engineering,

31:08.032 --> 31:11.119
from the macroscopic perspective,
in many dimensions.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.205
Your barista element,
the engineering of that,

31:14.289 --> 31:16.332
worked as it was intended to.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.836
I really enjoyed the incorporation
of the pressurized canister

31:19.919 --> 31:23.423
to dispense the whipped cream,
and, you know, Edwin totally sold it.

31:23.506 --> 31:26.885
And I think your materials engineering
was pretty ingenious.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.304
It was divergent
from anything that's ever been done

31:29.387 --> 31:30.471
in this kitchen before.

31:30.555 --> 31:34.392
Weaving together a pasta,
I think, was just genius in a way.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.229
I really liked your use of edibles

31:38.313 --> 31:41.858
to achieve different textures
on your final design.

31:41.941 --> 31:46.195
The star of the show today,
for me, was that watermelon helmet.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.282
When I looked up close,
I saw beautiful details.

31:49.365 --> 31:53.369
I thought the use of the penne on there
was so skilled and ingenious,

31:53.453 --> 31:54.287
texture-wise,

31:54.370 --> 31:57.874
but when I zoomed out,
it was a little bit jumbled.

31:59.250 --> 32:04.672
So perhaps it's worth thinking about
going for one theme and really going well,

32:04.756 --> 32:07.675
rather than perhaps
choosing too many things

32:07.759 --> 32:10.053
and there being
too many details to look at.

32:12.221 --> 32:15.016
Rodolfo, Sara, thank you very much.

32:15.725 --> 32:19.062
Well done. Randi and Jacob,
it is your time to shine.

32:19.145 --> 32:20.521
[contestants cheering]

32:23.983 --> 32:28.279
[Justin] Please welcome to the stage,
Randi and Jacob's model, Shanice.

32:28.863 --> 32:30.782
Yes.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.158
Hi.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.493
[techno music playing]

32:39.207 --> 32:40.750
[Joanne] Oh, my goodness.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.336
[Randi] Our cuckoo clock is very special,

32:43.419 --> 32:46.506
and time is very important
to all of us bakineers

32:46.589 --> 32:48.132
when we're in the kitchen.

32:48.883 --> 32:53.471
Our cuckoo clock top is made out of
gingerbread with a fruit leather roof.

32:53.554 --> 32:58.017
On top is a bird's nest
made out of ramen and white chocolate.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.019
Oh, wow.

33:00.103 --> 33:03.064
[Jacob] The body of the dress
is actually made from fruit leather.

33:03.564 --> 33:04.524
That's amazing.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.442
The leaves are made of fondant,

33:06.526 --> 33:08.653
and then we have a wafer paper skirt

33:08.736 --> 33:10.655
coated with Flexique.

33:10.738 --> 33:14.993
The doors on the front of the headpiece
will open up, presenting our dessert.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.203
It should be when it gets to the 12.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.080
-[chimes]
-[Joanne gasps]

33:19.163 --> 33:21.165
[all cheering]

33:22.709 --> 33:24.502
-[Dr. O] All right.
-[Taylor] Wow.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.880
Amazing.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.759
The time has come
to serve that confection.

33:34.637 --> 33:36.514
[Justin laughing]

33:36.597 --> 33:37.849
Looks like brain surgery.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.856
[Renee] I made you today
a hummingbird cake.

33:44.939 --> 33:47.525
We thought it was so befitting
of a cuckoo clock.

33:47.608 --> 33:51.529
It has a cream cheese frosting
with toasted pecans

33:51.612 --> 33:54.240
served in a tempered chocolate
eggshell too.

33:54.323 --> 33:56.451
Randi, the flavors are really great.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.412
-The cream cheese frosting is perfect.
-Thank you.

33:59.495 --> 34:02.665
The addition of the toasted pecans on top
adds a nice little crunch.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.251
For me, it's a little bit dense.

34:06.544 --> 34:09.756
It's almost like it's chilled,
and it shouldn't be.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.716
It's not quite what I was expecting.

34:11.799 --> 34:15.803
I expected it to be a little bit lighter,
a little bit more moist.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.598
I did think it almost looked like
two separate outfits.

34:18.681 --> 34:21.934
I was curious why you went with
such different colors and patterns

34:22.018 --> 34:24.771
in each layer.
It was a little bit confused as a theme

34:24.854 --> 34:28.649
and I think even if it had been
a consistent color running between them,

34:28.733 --> 34:31.027
I wouldn't have maybe noticed
the gaps in between

34:31.110 --> 34:33.821
or where it was changing
from one section to the next.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.617
But I really enjoyed
how clean-looking your design was.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.786
There was no exposed edges,

34:39.869 --> 34:41.954
and also it was a very fun theme.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.625
I felt like you had
three impressively engineered,

34:45.708 --> 34:47.085
separate pieces, right?

34:47.168 --> 34:51.380
The Flexique skirt,
the middle piece that had the clock on it,

34:51.464 --> 34:53.508
as well as the headpiece.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.593
Now, we're all familiar
with cuckoo clocks,

34:55.676 --> 34:58.387
and when those doors open,
something comes out.

34:58.471 --> 35:01.432
So, maybe you should've thought
of some telescoping mechanism

35:01.516 --> 35:03.726
that would've presented us
with our confection.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.728
That could've taken it to the next level.

35:05.812 --> 35:09.148
That sort of, like, threw me off
in how they were engineered.

35:10.691 --> 35:13.778
-Randi, Jacob, well done. Thank you both.
-[Jacob] Thank you.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.532
[Justin] Up next on the runway,
team Cindy and Taylor.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.117
-Give it up!
-[Taylor] Let's do it!

35:22.662 --> 35:26.415
[Justin] Please welcome to the stage
Cindy and Taylor's model, Hannah!

35:26.499 --> 35:27.875
[contestants cheering]

35:30.086 --> 35:30.920
Yes.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.341
[techno music playing]

35:35.424 --> 35:38.845
[Jacob] Yes! Serve up some salad!

35:39.428 --> 35:41.514
[Jacob] Wow. She is on the move.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.933
Yes, girl! Work it!

35:44.016 --> 35:46.018
[all laughing]

35:48.855 --> 35:52.900
So our look is Met Gala meets
material science, meets agriculture,

35:52.984 --> 35:55.695
and, hopefully,
that really razzle-dazzled you.

35:57.697 --> 36:02.034
This is our fully edible,
avant-garde, raspberry dress.

36:02.118 --> 36:04.745
I really wanna make a smoothie
all of sudden.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.832
[Taylor] We've really pushed
a single edible medium

36:07.915 --> 36:09.876
as far as it possibly can go.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.461
From head to toe, it's all gelatin.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.131
From the stem headband and stem collar

36:15.214 --> 36:17.466
to the drupelets
that go down to the waist,

36:17.550 --> 36:18.968
the decor on the shoes,

36:19.051 --> 36:22.597
and of course accessorizing
with the totally gelatin handbag.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.307
Look at the collar.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.184
-Oh, wow.
-It's all gelatin.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.686
[Taylor] We've pushed gelatin
further than we knew it could go.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.813
[cheering]

36:33.983 --> 36:35.735
-Hi, girl.
-You were amazing.

36:35.818 --> 36:39.197
Cindy, Taylor, we'd love to see
how this sassy raspberry

36:39.280 --> 36:41.532
serves up some sassy confection.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.534
Hannah, can you light up for us?

36:45.745 --> 36:47.038
[Joanne] Ohh!

36:47.997 --> 36:49.207
-[Cindy] All right.
-Wow.

36:55.671 --> 36:58.507
I made you a puff pastry
with a cream cheese filling

36:58.591 --> 37:00.301
and a raspberry baked on top.

37:00.801 --> 37:01.844
I do love raspberries,

37:01.928 --> 37:05.223
and I love raspberries
with a pastry like a puff pastry.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.934
And then to cut it
with the creaminess of the cream cheese,

37:08.017 --> 37:10.436
it's a really great flavor combination.

37:10.519 --> 37:13.189
I just wish
it had been baked a little bit longer.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.485
I love your approach
to the materials engineering.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.988
For the lights for the serving,
did your model just have

37:21.072 --> 37:23.866
something to complete a circuit
on her hand, is that the idea?

37:23.950 --> 37:27.286
[Taylor] The little ring that
Hannah's wearing was actually a conductor,

37:27.370 --> 37:30.414
and when she touches
the drupelet by her thigh,

37:30.498 --> 37:34.043
it completes the circuit
that activates LEDs.

37:34.627 --> 37:37.672
Wow, so you added
some clever electrical engineering

37:37.755 --> 37:39.590
along with your materials engineering.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.425
-Very good job.
-Thank you.

37:41.509 --> 37:44.595
Seeing your raspberry, it was like
something from a different planet.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.098
It was a piece of walking pop art.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.767
So I have to applaud you, really,
for the illusion,

37:49.850 --> 37:53.145
it really does look
like Hannah was a massive berry,

37:53.229 --> 37:56.482
which is what you were planning to do.
You certainly delivered on that.

37:56.565 --> 37:59.360
Your use of the gelatin
was really ingenious,

37:59.443 --> 38:02.571
and I think you've used gelatin
in ways that I've never seen before.

38:02.655 --> 38:06.826
It's the kind of thing I was looking for
in this challenge, using those materials,

38:06.909 --> 38:09.745
making those discoveries.
And I think you've done that today.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.873
-Thank you.
-Cindy and Taylor, thank you very much.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.962
Team Brandi and Menuka, join us.

38:18.921 --> 38:24.302
Please welcome to the stage
Brandi and Menuka's model, Sierra.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.679
[contestants cheering]

38:29.890 --> 38:31.892
[mellow music playing]

38:32.893 --> 38:33.936
Wow.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.479
Yes, girl!

38:39.692 --> 38:41.110
[Rodolfo] Oh, my goodness.

38:47.199 --> 38:50.161
Wow, it's gorgeous.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.956
[Brandi] So we went with
an enchanted forest design.

38:56.042 --> 38:59.628
The dress is done with marbled fondant,

38:59.712 --> 39:01.881
and I added wafer paper to the top

39:01.964 --> 39:04.842
and then rolled it
with a rolling pin to make it crack,

39:04.925 --> 39:07.511
to get the tree bark effect.

39:08.262 --> 39:11.807
Look at those butterflies.
Oh, my gosh, look at them.

39:13.517 --> 39:14.602
It's alive.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.980
[Menuka] The butterflies' wings
are made out of rice paper.

39:18.064 --> 39:22.693
[Brandi] The flowers are wafer paper,
the leaves are also wafer paper,

39:22.777 --> 39:25.237
and all of the tree bark
is tempered chocolate.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.281
A kinetic, edible structure.

39:30.493 --> 39:31.327
Yes!

39:31.410 --> 39:32.995
[contestants cheering]

39:36.540 --> 39:39.960
How are these butterflies coming to life?
What's the engineering behind it?

39:40.044 --> 39:43.756
So, basically, I have
a central control unit in her backpack,

39:43.839 --> 39:46.509
and send electric pulses
to those butterflies.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.511
So then, every time you pulse it

39:48.594 --> 39:50.179
and the wire get heated

39:50.262 --> 39:52.056
and push the lever down,

39:52.139 --> 39:53.474
and lift the wings up.

39:53.557 --> 39:56.102
They're thermally triggered,
not electrically triggered.

39:56.185 --> 39:58.396
-Exactly. Thermally triggered.
-That's brilliant.

39:58.479 --> 40:02.358
We would love to see how your costume
serves up our confections.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.529
-A little trimming.
-Wha--

40:06.612 --> 40:07.446
[Justin] Wow.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.784
Doesn't hurt, does it, Sierra?

40:11.867 --> 40:13.035
[all laughing]

40:15.204 --> 40:18.457
I decided to bake a macaron,

40:18.541 --> 40:23.170
dusted with freeze-dried raspberries
on top and a passion fruit curd

40:23.254 --> 40:24.088
in the middle.

40:25.172 --> 40:29.176
And obviously the wafer paper is edible,
but really it's just a serving mechanism.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.390
Brandi, the macaron itself
is perfectly done.

40:34.473 --> 40:37.435
It's got the eggshell interior,
it's delicate,

40:37.518 --> 40:39.937
and then the inside is a nice, fine,

40:40.020 --> 40:42.106
almost crumb.
It's not really a cake crumb,

40:42.189 --> 40:43.399
but it's really well done.

40:43.482 --> 40:46.986
The filling to macaron ratio is perfect.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.321
Typically, there is
a little buttercream inside

40:49.405 --> 40:51.991
to cut through the richness
of the macaron,

40:52.074 --> 40:54.994
but you've done a really lovely curd,
because it's creamy enough

40:55.077 --> 40:56.871
that you don't miss having cream.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.706
-It tastes really great.
-Thank you.

40:58.789 --> 41:02.835
Brandi, Menuka, when I saw your outfit,
it looked like a designer was involved.

41:02.918 --> 41:05.379
I really liked how you left
the main body quite sparse,

41:05.463 --> 41:07.715
so your eye was drawn
to all the right bits,

41:07.798 --> 41:10.634
and we could see
that amazing butterfly going off

41:10.718 --> 41:13.679
at the top and all your lovely foliage
you put on there.

41:13.762 --> 41:17.183
So I think from a design perspective,
that was really very savvy.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.476
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.102
Menuka, my man.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.605
This was the challenge

41:22.688 --> 41:25.941
for you to display
your engineering talents.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.444
And the fact that the very same branches

41:28.527 --> 41:31.280
that were supporting
your delicious confections

41:31.363 --> 41:34.533
also were the current-carrying branches,

41:34.617 --> 41:37.369
that's beautiful bakineering,
if I'm not mistaken, sir.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.246
-That is right, yep.
-That is right.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.582
Great job on that one, Menuka.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.042
Thank you, appreciate it.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.919
Brandi, Menuka, thank you so much.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.086
-Thank you.
-Well done.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.634
Well, that was quite a costume party.

41:52.134 --> 41:56.138
Let's have one final walk
from our bakineer supermodels.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.849
Please, give it up, everybody!

41:58.933 --> 42:00.351
[contestants cheering]

42:13.197 --> 42:14.198
[Taylor] Yeah!

42:19.578 --> 42:20.955
Thank you, supermodels.

42:21.830 --> 42:25.834
The costumes were fierce,
but the competition is fiercer.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.420
So, judges, you have
a tough decision to make.

42:28.504 --> 42:29.505
We'll leave you to it.

42:30.005 --> 42:31.882
I'm gonna work on my smize.

42:35.511 --> 42:36.929
[Sara] I'm feeling pretty nervous.

42:37.012 --> 42:39.932
Judges, I don't think they were
as impressed with the costume

42:40.015 --> 42:41.642
as we were hoping that they'd be.

42:41.725 --> 42:44.603
This is the hardest decision
we've had to make. For sure.

42:44.687 --> 42:48.774
-Absolutely.
-And on the dessert part, I feel terrible.

42:48.857 --> 42:52.444
Like, I never broke a mousseline before.

42:52.528 --> 42:56.240
I feel a little scared
that we can go home.

42:58.325 --> 43:00.327
[tense music playing]

43:06.875 --> 43:09.670
Five teams of bakineers are left,

43:10.254 --> 43:11.463
but, as you know,

43:12.131 --> 43:14.300
only four teams will be moving on.

43:14.383 --> 43:15.551
Steve and Renee…

43:17.386 --> 43:19.138
Brandi and Menuka…

43:21.390 --> 43:22.766
I have some bad news.

43:29.815 --> 43:31.150
Unfortunately,

43:32.359 --> 43:33.861
only one of you

43:34.403 --> 43:36.238
will be the winner of today's mission.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.702
So, congratulations.

43:41.785 --> 43:44.788
We're five missions in,
and it was incredibly close.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.832
But there can only be one winner.

43:46.915 --> 43:49.668
That winner will be revealed

43:50.794 --> 43:54.048
by the greatest supermodel
the world has ever known.

43:54.840 --> 43:55.966
[Renee laughing]

43:56.050 --> 43:57.760
[Justin] My old friend is back.

44:05.476 --> 44:06.602
Oh!

44:06.685 --> 44:08.562
[Taylor] Yes, Petey.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.189
Oh, very nice.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.244
Congratulations…

44:28.207 --> 44:29.958
Brandi and Menuka.

44:36.548 --> 44:37.925
[Andrew] Congrats. Well done.

44:38.467 --> 44:41.804
I thought your design looked like
it had come out of a fashion house,

44:41.887 --> 44:43.931
and what you achieved
with those butterflies

44:44.014 --> 44:46.517
and the design effect
was really enchanting.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.268
-So, very well done.
-Thank you.

44:48.352 --> 44:51.730
What this means, of course,
is you will earn an incredible advantage

44:51.814 --> 44:53.148
in the next mission.

44:53.232 --> 44:55.901
Steve and Renee,
this of course means you're safe.

44:56.402 --> 44:58.112
Which means we have two teams

44:58.195 --> 45:02.449
who are one step closer
to the $100,000 prize.

45:02.533 --> 45:03.742
That also means,

45:03.826 --> 45:07.746
of the three remaining teams,
one of you will be going home.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.999
Cindy and Taylor…

45:14.795 --> 45:15.963
…you're also safe.

45:16.046 --> 45:17.297
[Cindy, softly] Oh, Jesus.

45:18.340 --> 45:19.842
That leaves Randi and Jacob…

45:21.760 --> 45:23.053
and Rodolfo and Sara.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.723
Judges, which team is going home today?

45:26.265 --> 45:28.934
The team going home today is…

45:33.147 --> 45:37.776
…Randi and Jacob, I'm sorry to say
this has been your final mission.

45:37.860 --> 45:41.113
I loved how you used edibles
in your design,

45:41.196 --> 45:43.073
particularly the fruit leather,

45:43.157 --> 45:47.202
but it did feel a little bit jumbled
and not one cohesive costume.

45:47.286 --> 45:50.205
And, Randi, your cake was a bit too dense.

45:50.289 --> 45:53.500
But we've really enjoyed
your bakineering creations while here.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.836
I can't wait to see
what you do in the future.

45:55.919 --> 45:59.089
-Congratulations for making it this far.
-Thank you.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.345
[Jacob] It sucks to go home.

46:06.054 --> 46:10.476
But at the same time, this has been
an amazing journey of discovery

46:10.559 --> 46:12.019
and I still think

46:12.102 --> 46:15.105
the pieces that we made
are absolutely incredible.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.857
[Randi] Moving forward,
I'm always going to

46:16.940 --> 46:18.108
consider myself a bakineer,

46:18.233 --> 46:20.277
because I learned the importance

46:20.360 --> 46:22.196
and the magnitude

46:22.279 --> 46:24.406
of how wonderful cake design can be

46:24.490 --> 46:26.241
when you truly marry

46:26.325 --> 46:28.786
engineering and baking together.

46:28.869 --> 46:31.497
-I'm proud that we made it this far.
-[Jacob] Yeah, exactly.

46:31.580 --> 46:35.042
And it was really hard,
and really difficult, and a lot of work.

46:35.125 --> 46:37.252
-But a lot of fun.
-But a lot of fun.

46:41.507 --> 46:44.676
Well, four teams remaining.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.888
You are all one step closer to the finale

46:47.971 --> 46:51.141
and the $100,000 grand prize.

46:51.642 --> 46:56.104
Our brain trust here thought long and hard
about what you're about to face,

46:56.730 --> 47:00.317
and I must say it is quite a tall order.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.861
You guys ready to get this started?

47:02.945 --> 47:03.987
-Yeah.
-[Justin] Yeah?

47:04.071 --> 47:07.825
All of the money
and the limited fame is on the line.

47:07.908 --> 47:11.870
You are truly the architects
of your own fate.

47:12.371 --> 47:15.374
I'm dropping clues here, okay?
I'm approaching the button.

47:15.457 --> 47:17.793
-You ready for this to happen?
-Smash the button.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.086
[Justin] Let's do it.

47:19.169 --> 47:23.423
[woman] Mission launch
in three, two, one, go.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.008
[Justin] It is time to bake and build

47:25.092 --> 47:27.845
something bigger
than you have ever made before!

47:27.928 --> 47:29.137
[Renee] Uh-oh.

47:30.222 --> 47:32.224
[theme music playing]
