(pop music playing)

00:48.380 --> 00:53.408
(pop intro playing)

00:53.450 --> 00:56.544
* The bittersweet
between my teeth *

00:57.550 --> 00:59.359
* Trying to find

00:59.390 --> 01:01.381
* The in-betweens

01:03.130 --> 01:06.588
* Fall back in love
eventually *

01:06.630 --> 01:09.463
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:09.500 --> 01:12.094
*

01:12.140 --> 01:14.233
* The bittersweet
between my teeth... *

01:14.270 --> 01:15.339
*

01:15.370 --> 01:16.701
(phone rings)

01:16.740 --> 01:18.230
Hello?

01:18.270 --> 01:20.830
Yeah, I'm coming
to get him in...

01:20.880 --> 01:24.304
I'm sorry,
did you say he escaped?

01:24.350 --> 01:26.409
Hi. It's Joan Watson.
On the off chance

01:26.450 --> 01:28.475
you haven't already been
contacted by Hemdale,

01:28.520 --> 01:30.613
your son left rehab
a little early this morning.

01:30.650 --> 01:33.414
I'm already at his house
to see if he's here.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.815
I'll call you
if there's a problem.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.827
WATSON :
Excuse me,

01:43.870 --> 01:45.861
I'm looking for Mister...

01:50.510 --> 01:52.330
(door creaks)

01:53.380 --> 01:55.530
Hello?

01:55.580 --> 01:58.344
(several televisions playing
in distance)

01:58.380 --> 02:01.372
(televisions continue playing)

02:11.760 --> 02:12.624
Excuse me, Mister--

02:12.660 --> 02:13.490
Shh!

02:16.270 --> 02:18.397
(all TV audio stops)

02:21.970 --> 02:24.530
My name is Joan Watson.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.333
I've been hired
by your father

02:26.380 --> 02:27.836
to be your sober companion.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.270
He told me he was going
to e-mail you about me.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.846
I'm here to make the transition

02:32.880 --> 02:33.869
from your rehab
experience

02:33.920 --> 02:36.445
to the routine
of your everyday
life as smooth

02:36.490 --> 02:39.186
as possible, so I will be living
with you for the next six weeks,

02:39.220 --> 02:42.519
which means I'll be
available to you 24/7.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.858
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

02:44.890 --> 02:46.858
Um...
I know what
you're thinking:

02:46.900 --> 02:49.425
the world is a cynical place,
and I must be a cynical man,

02:49.470 --> 02:51.768
thinking a woman
like you would fall
for a line like that.

02:51.800 --> 02:57.739
Thing is...
it isn't a line,

02:57.770 --> 03:02.548
so please hear me
when I say this.

03:02.580 --> 03:06.869
I have never loved anyone
as I do you right now...

03:06.920 --> 03:08.740
in this moment.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.952
MAN (on TV): Do you believe
in love at first sight?

03:12.990 --> 03:16.482
I know what you're thinking:
the world is a cynical place,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.885
and I must be a cynical man,
thinking a woman like you

03:18.930 --> 03:20.488
would fall for a line like that.

03:20.530 --> 03:22.293
Thing is, it isn't a line,

03:22.330 --> 03:24.423
so, please...

03:24.470 --> 03:26.233
hear me when I say this.

03:26.270 --> 03:27.692
I have never loved anyone

03:27.740 --> 03:30.459
as I do you right now,

03:30.510 --> 03:31.738
in this moment.
(remote control ClleS)

03:31.770 --> 03:33.499
(remote clatters to floor)
Spot on.

03:34.340 --> 03:34.908
Sherlock Holmes.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.542
Please don't get comfortable.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.343
We won't be here long.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.439
Mr. Holmes,

03:41.480 --> 03:43.619
did your father tell you
about me or not?

03:43.650 --> 03:47.689
Uh, he e-mailed, said to expect
some sort of addict-sitter.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.381
Well, then he
explained his conditions

03:49.430 --> 03:50.522
with respect to your sobriety?

03:50.560 --> 03:52.926
Well, if you mean his threats
to evict me from this,

03:52.960 --> 03:56.566
the shoddiest and the
least renovated of the
five-- count them, five--

03:56.600 --> 03:58.966
properties he owns in
New York, then yeah,
he made his conditions

03:59.000 --> 04:00.399
quite clear.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.499
I use, I wind up on the street.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.633
I refuse your,
quote-unquote, "help,"

04:04.670 --> 04:06.001
I wind up on the street.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.577
It's my understanding
that most sober companions

04:08.610 --> 04:09.941
are recovering addicts
themselves, but...

04:09.980 --> 04:12.676
you've never had a problem
with drugs or alcohol.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.415
Your father told you.

04:14.450 --> 04:15.712
Of course he didn't.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.684
Uh, would you care to explain
why you broke out

04:17.720 --> 04:19.813
of your rehab facility the same
day you were being released?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.384
Bored.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.489
You were bored?

04:22.530 --> 04:23.679
No, I am bored right now.

04:23.730 --> 04:24.924
It happens often;
you'll get used to it.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.598
Regarding
our mutual friends

04:26.630 --> 04:29.326
at Hemdale, I'd say
they should be thanking me

04:29.370 --> 04:30.667
for exposing the flaws

04:30.700 --> 04:31.724
in their rubbish security
system, wouldn't you?

04:31.770 --> 04:32.737
(sniffs)
Excellent.

04:32.770 --> 04:35.694
There was a woman leaving
just as I got here.

04:35.740 --> 04:37.560
Did she get you high?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.475
Actually, about six feet.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.668
I actually find
sex repellent.

04:41.710 --> 04:43.598
All those fluids
and all the sounds,

04:43.650 --> 04:44.548
but my brain
and my body

04:44.580 --> 04:46.844
require it to function
at optimum levels,

04:46.880 --> 04:52.352
so I feed them as needed.

04:52.390 --> 04:53.812
You're a doctor;
you understand.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.851
Uh, I'm not a doctor.

04:55.890 --> 04:58.484
Werea doctor-- a surgeon,
judging by your hands.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.953
Is your car
parked nearby?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.058
Uh, yes, it's just outsi...

05:02.100 --> 05:04.364
How did you know I had a car?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.994
Parking ticket-- fell out of
your purse when you dropped it.

05:07.040 --> 05:07.995
Can't have one

05:08.040 --> 05:09.860
without the
other, can you?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.798
We're late. _
We need to get gorng.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.899
Uh, late for what?

05:13.940 --> 05:14.872
Actually, scratch the car.

05:14.910 --> 05:16.946
Manhattan Bridge is
down to a single lane.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.641
We'll take the
tube instead.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.977
Look at this place. Yuck.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.318
Can't wait for you to tidy it.

05:25.820 --> 05:28.357
Prior to my stint
in junkie jail,

05:28.390 --> 05:30.529
I worked as a consultant
at Scotland Yard.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.495
Your father told me--
he said you were a detective?

05:33.530 --> 05:35.953
I was _a consultant. _
I wasn't paid for my serVIces,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.764
and therefore I answered
to no one but myself.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.760
(phone ringing)

05:42.810 --> 05:45.802
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

05:45.840 --> 05:47.808
WATSON:
What about London?

05:47.840 --> 05:49.376
What about it?

05:49.410 --> 05:50.809
He told me that's
where you bottomed out.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.999
He thinks something happened

05:52.050 --> 05:53.540
to you there--
he just doesn't know what.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.377
Handsome woman, your mother.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.888
It's very big of her to take
your dad back after the affair.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.979
How could you possibly...?

06:01.790 --> 06:03.849
You still haven't_told me
where we're gorng yet.

06:03.890 --> 06:07.599
About that, I think
you and Father will
be pleased to hear

06:07.630 --> 06:09.894
I have devised a post-rehab
regimen for myself

06:09.930 --> 06:11.522
that'll keep me quite busy.

06:11.570 --> 06:14.562
I decided to resume my
work as a consultant here...

06:14.600 --> 06:16.659
in New York.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.735
(siren chirping)

06:32.790 --> 06:36.112
Tell me, how do clients
typically introduce you?
What do you mean?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.583
I-I mean I ﬁnd it
hard to believe they'd
actually tell someone

06:38.630 --> 06:40.427
they've been assigned a
glorified helper monkey.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.599
Helper monkey?
Well, you and I have

06:42.630 --> 06:44.120
what's known as companion/client
confidentiality,

06:44.170 --> 06:46.889
which means that you can
introduce me however you like.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.828
Friend, coworker, relative,
and I'll play along.

06:48.870 --> 06:51.703
But to be honest,
most clients just call me

06:51.740 --> 06:52.968
their companion.

06:53.010 --> 06:54.102
Hm.

06:54.140 --> 06:55.573
Captain Gregson.

06:55.610 --> 06:57.646
Ah. Holmes.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.716
(chuckles)
How you doing?
Miss Watson,

06:59.750 --> 07:01.069
this is Captain Gregson.
Captain Gregson,

07:01.120 --> 07:03.816
this is Miss Watson,
my personal valet.

07:03.850 --> 07:04.885
GREGSON:
How do you do?

07:04.920 --> 07:06.512
She waits out here.
I'm afraid she's

07:06.560 --> 07:07.811
quite crucial to
my process, Captain.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.054
It's okay, really.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.455
Actually, it isn't.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.958
At least not according
to my father's e-mail.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.150
'Cause he-he explained it's
the job of a proper valet

07:15.200 --> 07:18.499
to accompany his or her charge
to their place of business.

07:18.530 --> 07:20.737
Well, consider this
my place of business.

07:20.770 --> 07:22.909
Consider every wretched hive
of depravity and murder

07:22.940 --> 07:25.067
in this city my
place of business.

07:25.110 --> 07:28.807
Unless, of course, you
don't think you have the
stomach for the work I do.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.569
I'm good.

07:30.610 --> 07:33.943
Could you put
these gloves on, please?

07:36.250 --> 07:38.616
Dr. Richard Mantlo
came home a few hours ago

07:38.650 --> 07:41.551
to find his door kicked in
and his wife...

07:41.590 --> 07:43.751
Amy Dampier, missing.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.678
That's, uh...

07:45.730 --> 07:47.721
that's Mantlo over there.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.899
He's a headshrinker out
at Sanbridge Hospital.

07:49.930 --> 07:51.659
Says he caught an emergency
last night,

07:51.700 --> 07:53.167
didn't get home till 5:00 am.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.191
Saw the front door,

07:55.240 --> 07:57.561
called 911.

07:57.610 --> 08:00.977
First officers on the scene
found srgns of-of a struggle

08:01.010 --> 08:02.204
in the kitchen

08:02.240 --> 08:03.707
and in the master bedroom.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.071
But no Ms. Dampier.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.042
Ransom demand?

08:08.050 --> 08:09.039
Hm.

08:18.590 --> 08:20.626
GREGSON:
What is it?

08:20.660 --> 08:22.491
I'm not sure.

08:27.770 --> 08:29.601
Ms. Dampier's cell phone,
have you recovered it?

08:29.640 --> 08:31.062
We have her cell phone?

08:31.110 --> 08:33.135
Thank you, Detective.

08:36.180 --> 08:37.169
Hm.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.214
Hm.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.125
She either lost a tremendous
amount of weight or underwent

08:50.160 --> 08:52.799
significant plastic surgery
sometime in the last two years.

08:52.830 --> 08:55.754
WATSON: She looks the same
in all the photos.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.960
That's my point.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.228
Ovular frames...

08:58.270 --> 08:59.737
are older, have
been here longer

08:59.770 --> 09:00.668
You can tell by the way

09:00.700 --> 09:02.930
the wall has faded--
square frames newer.

09:02.970 --> 09:05.006
They're the only ones
that feature Ms. Dampier.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.632
Coincidence? No.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.977
Check her cell phone.

09:08.010 --> 09:10.171
No photos of her
older than two years.

09:10.210 --> 09:12.201
Yet there are countless
pictures of other people

09:12.250 --> 09:14.741
in her life,
as many as five years ago.

09:21.320 --> 09:24.323
WATSON: I take it you two have
worked together before?

09:24.360 --> 09:25.520
Yeah, ten years ago.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.927
A few months after
9/11 I was assigned
to Scotland Yard

09:28.960 --> 09:31.326
(sniffing)
to observe their
counterterrorlsm bureau.

09:31.370 --> 09:34.567
Holmes mostly worked
homicides, but, uh...

09:35.970 --> 09:37.767
...our paths still
crossed a few times.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.348
Yeah?

09:50.390 --> 09:51.982
Ms. Dampier knew
her attacker.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.681
She let him
into the house herself.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.119
(chuckles)
Captain,

09:55.160 --> 09:55.956
who-who is this guy?

09:55.990 --> 09:57.685
There are two
broken glasses here.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.652
HOLMES: You can tell from
the volume of shards.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.952
Obviously, she was pouring
a glass of water for her guest

10:02.000 --> 10:02.796
when he assailed her.

10:02.830 --> 10:04.866
Right. Is that something
you would do

10:04.900 --> 10:07.061
if some nut job comes in
and kicks your door in,

10:07.100 --> 10:09.830
you ask him
if he's thirsty.

10:10.870 --> 10:12.269
Could I...?

10:12.310 --> 10:13.299
Thank you.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.385
Base of glass number... two.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.753
If you take another glance

10:30.790 --> 10:32.997
at the boot print
on the front door,

10:33.030 --> 10:35.419
you will see an almost
imperceptible spot of blood

10:35.460 --> 10:37.690
where the heel made contact.
Lab tests, I'm certain,

10:37.730 --> 10:40.233
will conclude it's
the victim's blood,
and could only have been

10:40.270 --> 10:43.103
left there after the assault
had already taken place.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.028
Ms. Dampier

10:45.070 --> 10:46.401
let the man in
because he was

10:46.440 --> 10:47.737
familiar to her.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.429
He kicked the door in
as he exited

10:49.480 --> 10:51.141
to try to obscure this fact.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.239
Also, he took something
from the living room.

11:00.020 --> 11:03.023
Note the symmetry
of the space, hm?

11:03.060 --> 11:05.949
This wall is very nearly
a reflection of that one.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.958
Pictures, pictures,
knickknacks, knickknacks.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.992
I see balance everywhere,
except...

11:11.030 --> 11:12.964
this one space.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.905
Hey, something was
here-- what was it?

11:18.940 --> 11:21.238
I'm sorry?
Maybe this isn't
the best time.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.747
No, no, please
concentrate.

11:22.780 --> 11:23.940
Something used
to occupy that space.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.005
I need you to tell me
what it was.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.915
MANTLO:
Uh, it was an old...

11:27.950 --> 11:31.841
ring box-- Amy's grandmother
gave it to her. Why?

11:31.890 --> 11:34.017
You said there were also signs
of struggle

11:34.060 --> 11:35.209
in the master bedroom?

11:35.260 --> 11:37.228
Mm-hmm.

11:44.230 --> 11:45.993
What is it?

11:46.030 --> 11:47.895
Why is it so important that
the kidnapper took a ring box?

11:47.940 --> 11:49.965
Kidnappers don't
take trophies. Killers do.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.034
OFFICER:
There's no body, genius.

11:51.070 --> 11:53.732
There's no blood on
the front stoop or walk, either.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.202
It's rather difficult
not to leave any

11:55.240 --> 11:56.377
when you're abducting someone

11:56.410 --> 11:57.877
with an arterial wound,
wouldn't you agree?

11:57.910 --> 11:59.241
You're certain
your men have been

11:59.280 --> 12:00.770
over every inch
of this house?

12:00.820 --> 12:02.811
Of course.

12:05.090 --> 12:08.856
But as you can see,
there was a struggle here.

12:27.410 --> 12:29.378
She's in the safe room.

12:29.410 --> 12:30.809
What safe room?

12:30.850 --> 12:32.818
The one behind that wall.

12:32.850 --> 12:35.045
Husband didn't say anything
about any safe room.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.412
There's a slight angle to the
floor in here. You can't f...

12:37.450 --> 12:40.112
It's...

12:40.160 --> 12:41.457
The extra weight

12:41.490 --> 12:43.128
of the safe room
steel reinforcements

12:43.160 --> 12:45.526
can_cause the floor
around It to decline slightly,

12:45.560 --> 12:48.199
creating a slope between

12:48.230 --> 12:50.460
one and five degrees.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.491
(metallic creak,
clacking)

13:00.380 --> 13:02.371
(Watson gasps)

13:04.410 --> 13:07.971
Sometimes I hate it
when I'm right.

13:12.190 --> 13:15.114
(sighs) For the last time,
I loved my wife.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.287
I didn't hurt her,
and before this moment,

13:17.330 --> 13:19.924
I had no idea_ there was
any safe room In my house.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.066
You get why that's hard
for us to believe, don't you?

13:23.100 --> 13:26.297
The place was gutted before Amy
and I moved in two years ago.

13:26.330 --> 13:28.491
She oversaw_
all the construction.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.132
I'm sorry,
but, uh, are you saying

13:30.170 --> 13:32.035
she had it installed,
but never told you?

13:36.510 --> 13:38.569
How do you do it?

13:38.610 --> 13:40.146
Do what?

13:40.180 --> 13:41.943
Guess things.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.084
I don't guess. I observe.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.248
And once I've observed,
I deduce.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.917
You said you could
tell from my hands

13:48.960 --> 13:50.086
that I used to
be a surgeon.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.587
"Hand"-- singular, actually.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.393
It was soft, no calluses.

13:54.430 --> 13:57.820
Also, it smelled
faintly of beeswax.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.194
Oh, many surgeons, as you know,

14:02.240 --> 14:04.561
use a beeswax cream
to protect their hands

14:04.610 --> 14:06.999
from the dehydrating effects
of repeated washings. Well...

14:07.040 --> 14:09.076
You're no longer practicing,
but old habits die hard.

14:09.110 --> 14:11.442
As far as why you gave up
your medical career

14:11.480 --> 14:13.277
to become a companion--

14:13.320 --> 14:15.015
I'd wager that addiction
claimed the life

14:15.050 --> 14:18.349
of someone close to you,
and his or her death moved you

14:18.390 --> 14:23.623
to make drastic changes
in your life.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.082
Am I close?

14:25.130 --> 14:26.893
What about my father?

14:26.930 --> 14:28.056
What about him?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.568
How did you know
he had an affair?

14:30.600 --> 14:31.999
Google.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.389
Well, not everything
is deducible.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.601
(door opening)

14:40.580 --> 14:43.174
I, uh, just want to say thanks
for helping out today.

14:43.210 --> 14:47.112
You-you got us our guy in,
and, uh... and we're grateful.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.913
We can take it from here.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.009
Respectfully, Detective,
I doubt that very much,

14:51.050 --> 14:52.608
'cause I have
reason to believe

14:52.650 --> 14:54.652
that Richard Mantlo
didn't kill his wife.

14:54.690 --> 14:56.510
Wait, wait, wait.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.629
Wait, wait.

14:57.660 --> 14:58.729
Come again?

14:58.760 --> 15:01.024
Dr. Mantlo has girls' feet,
or hadn't you noticed?

15:01.060 --> 15:02.391
He's a size eight
if he's an inch.

15:02.430 --> 15:04.227
The boot print on his
front door was an 11.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.396
So? So he was smart.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.068
He wore bigger shoes
to throw us off.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.330
Did he also wear bigger hands
when he strangled his wife?

15:09.370 --> 15:10.337
Holmes...

15:10.370 --> 15:11.928
Well, these strangulation
marks are indicative

15:11.970 --> 15:14.109
of a man much
larger than Mantlo.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.107
No just heavier,
but-but taller.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.277
I'd estimate his height

15:16.310 --> 15:18.471
to be somewhere between
six foot-one, six foot-three.

15:18.510 --> 15:21.377
Your M.E. will come to the same
conclusron In a couple of hours.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.047
I'm delivering it now.
You're a doctor.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.648
Tell 'em I'm right.
I'm not
a doctor.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.146
Were a doctor.

15:26.190 --> 15:28.511
Surely you haven't forgotten
how bruising works.

15:30.090 --> 15:33.196
Okay, yeah, sure, these hands
do seem a little small for the

15:33.230 --> 15:35.528
bruise pattern, but I...
With your permission,
Captain, I'd like a moment

15:35.560 --> 15:36.993
alone with Dr. Mantlo.
Captain, this...

15:37.030 --> 15:38.122
You got two minutes.

15:45.740 --> 15:48.607
Tall men in your life--
I'd like a list.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.100
(siren blaring)

15:52.150 --> 15:54.243
Amy was a good person,
but if you're here

15:54.280 --> 15:56.578
because you think I had
something to do with it...

15:56.620 --> 15:59.043
Dr. Mantlo said
that you'd made a pass at her

15:59.090 --> 16:00.580
at a holiday party last year.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.485
Actually, no,
I didn't.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.421
I asked her about all
the plastic surgery she'd had.

16:05.460 --> 16:06.722
Plastic surgery?

16:06.760 --> 16:09.627
Okay, look, I helped
plan a fund-raiser

16:09.660 --> 16:12.322
for the hospital, two years ago,
that was before the surgeries.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.065
I know I still
have the pictures.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.489
(beep, then
indistinct voice over P.A.)

16:21.680 --> 16:24.171
There.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.544
That's a picture of
Amy and Dr. Mantlo

16:28.580 --> 16:32.118
that I took that night, okay?
Tell me you wouldn't want

16:32.150 --> 16:35.278
to ask her why she did it.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.480
Tell me about the
stalking charge

16:36.520 --> 16:38.078
brought against
you two years ago.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.223
I asked my neighbor out.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.626
She overreacted.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.696
Hmm.
Mr. Polk,
can you tell us

16:44.730 --> 16:46.322
where you were last night?

16:46.370 --> 16:48.099
POLK:
Home... alone.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.630
I know.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.638
Not much of an alibi,
but I don't care,

16:51.670 --> 16:53.706
because I didn't do it.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.090
(door creaks open)

17:22.270 --> 17:24.158
Um, did you know

17:24.210 --> 17:26.337
that honey was dripping
through the ceiling?

17:26.370 --> 17:27.803
Yes. Happens sometimes.

17:27.840 --> 17:31.708
I take it beekeeping is a hobby.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.843
(buzzing)
I'm writing a book.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.075
Practical Handbook
of Bee Culture

17:36.120 --> 17:38.042
with Some Observations Upon
the Segregation of the Queen.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.480
Up here. I've just started
Chapter 19.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.852
Would you like to hear
the last few paragraphs?

17:43.890 --> 17:47.223
Did you talk to the police about
that scary administrator guy?

17:47.260 --> 17:48.818
I have not.
But I thought that...

17:48.860 --> 17:50.464
Mr. Polk is a prat, no doubt,

17:50.500 --> 17:52.092
but his body language

17:52.130 --> 17:53.836
said "sub," not "dom."

17:53.870 --> 17:57.169
I don't see him having the
berries to take another life.

17:59.140 --> 18:03.600
Why do you suppose
you hate your job so much?

18:03.650 --> 18:04.799
I don't hate my job.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.408
You have two
alarm clocks.

18:06.450 --> 18:07.872
No one with two_al_arm clocks
loves their job.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.512
Two alarm clocks means
It's a chore

18:09.550 --> 18:10.847
for you
to get up in the morning.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.649
You don't hate
what I do, though.

18:14.690 --> 18:17.523
That much was obvious
when we talked to Mr. Polk.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.687
There was a look

18:19.730 --> 18:20.799
on your face.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.867
I imagine it was the same look
you wore to the OR.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.527
when you were still a surgeon.

18:25.570 --> 18:30.507
You're wrong.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.236
I know my father secured
your services

18:33.280 --> 18:35.703
for the next six weeks?

18:37.510 --> 18:39.808
The simple truth is,
I don't need you.

18:39.850 --> 18:41.818
I'm finished with drugs.

18:41.850 --> 18:43.681
I won't be using them again.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.842
My advice?

18:46.890 --> 18:49.381
Take a six-week holiday.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.526
I promise I won't tell Papa.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.810
(sighs)

19:30.370 --> 19:31.894
I'm gonna need your saliva now.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.961
10:37.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.400
I take back everything
I said last night.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.805
You obviously
love your job.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.377
Couldn't wait to get
started this morning.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.278
Open you mouth
so I can swab it.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.346
If you're on anything, the strip
on the cup will turn blue.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.914
I have a...

19:52.950 --> 19:55.214
I have a new theory
about our killer.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.922
I think he may have struck
at least once before.

19:57.960 --> 20:01.794
I-- who love what I do-- woke up
early and couldn't stop thinking

20:01.830 --> 20:03.991
about the ring box he stole
from Amy Dampier's living room.

20:04.030 --> 20:08.592
_ You said
It was some sort of trophy.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.664
And you know what flavor

20:09.700 --> 20:11.565
of killers takes
trophies, don't you?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.601
Serial. Souvenirs help them
differentiate between victims.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.279
It occurred to me that if Amy
wasn't our killer's first,

20:16.310 --> 20:18.346
though, there might be
other cases in common.

20:18.380 --> 20:21.269
Eileen Renfro.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.584
Savagely beaten and
strangled by an intruder

20:23.620 --> 20:25.508
in her Bronx home
two years ago.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.518
He took a jewelry
box on his way out,

20:27.560 --> 20:29.619
but left behind a
size 11 footprint.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.821
Drug free. Congratulations.

20:31.860 --> 20:33.691
Especially striking--
the physical similarities

20:33.730 --> 20:35.254
between her and Amy.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.292
Both were curvaceous
With long red hair.

20:38.330 --> 20:40.696
You think the killer has a type?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.833
The one significant difference
in the cases--

20:42.870 --> 20:46.328
Eileen Renfro survived
her attack.

20:52.010 --> 20:54.547
I'm sorry.

20:54.580 --> 20:57.788
I can see why you think
it might be the same guy.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.811
I just don't think
I can help you.
HOLMES:
We know from the police report

20:59.850 --> 21:02.318
that the man who assaulted you
wore a mask.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.658
That doesn't mean
you can't help us identify him.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.055
Did he say anything to you?

21:06.090 --> 21:08.456
No.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.924
I came in through my front door,
and he was just... there.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.631
Did he have a particular scent?

21:13.670 --> 21:15.797
Uh... I don't think so.

21:15.840 --> 21:16.932
Was he tall, short,
somewhere in between?

21:16.970 --> 21:18.506
I don't know.
I mean,

21:18.540 --> 21:20.531
he was on top
of me so quickly,

21:20.580 --> 21:21.979
his hands were around my throat.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.648
And what about the mask?

21:23.680 --> 21:24.601
What about it?

21:24.650 --> 21:27.847
Was it ski, Mexican wrestling,
paper plate?

21:27.880 --> 21:29.017
Ski.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.813
Good. Excellent.

21:30.850 --> 21:32.738
So, you got a good look

21:32.790 --> 21:35.759
at his eyes.

21:35.790 --> 21:37.849
Oh, correct me if I'm wrong,
but a-a strangler can,

21:37.890 --> 21:39.687
literally, not be more than
an arm's length

21:39.730 --> 21:41.391
from his stranglee,
can he? That's what? Two?
Mr. Holmes?

21:41.430 --> 21:43.796
Two and a half feet? I'm twice
that distance from you now.

21:43.830 --> 21:47.596
I can see that your eyes
are a lovely brown.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.699
I think I'd like you
to leave now.

21:49.740 --> 21:51.537
Why? 'Cause I know
that you're lying?

21:51.570 --> 21:52.605
Mr. Holmes!
No. She is.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.471
You can tell by the crucifix.
You fiddle with it

21:54.510 --> 21:55.704
every time I ask you a question.

21:55.740 --> 21:56.604
It's-it's pacifying behavior.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.870
It's just elementary
haptic communication.

21:58.910 --> 22:00.446
Just read a book, would you?

22:00.480 --> 22:02.641
She did see
her attacker's face.
Sherlock!

22:02.680 --> 22:03.908
I think she might even know
who he is!

22:03.950 --> 22:05.838
Get out.
You realize

22:05.890 --> 22:06.743
that because you protected him
two years ago,

22:06.790 --> 22:08.519
you have the blood
of an innocent woman

22:08.560 --> 22:10.585
on your hands, don't you?
Perhaps you'd like

22:10.630 --> 22:11.881
to go for two or three or four.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.728
That's enough!

22:14.760 --> 22:16.591
You're done here.
Go wait in the car.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.802
What a jerk!

22:26.170 --> 22:29.731
I'm... I'm really sorry
about that.

22:39.750 --> 22:42.981
The name of the man who
attacked her is Peter Saldua.

22:43.020 --> 22:45.420
He was her brother's
best friend growing up.

22:45.460 --> 22:46.825
His father was abusive,
so her parents took him in

22:46.860 --> 22:47.827
his senior year
of high school.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.896
Eileen heard from her
brother that he works

22:49.930 --> 22:52.069
for a florist in Chelsea.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.893
I knew it.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.408
I knew that if I started
a row in there,

22:59.440 --> 23:01.908
you'd come to her defense,
and if you came to her defense,

23:01.940 --> 23:04.500
she might very well
tell you the truth.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.910
You are so full of it.

23:08.950 --> 23:11.418
(phone beeps, line rings)

23:11.450 --> 23:12.849
This is Gregson.

23:12.890 --> 23:14.551
Captain Gregson,
Sherlock Holmes.

23:14.590 --> 23:16.057
I'm calling because I believe
I've uncovered

23:16.090 --> 23:17.853
the name of a strong suspect

23:17.890 --> 23:20.552
in the murder of Amy Dampier.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.819
Name wouldn't be Peter S_aldua
by any chance, would it?

23:23.870 --> 23:25.826
How did you know?

23:25.870 --> 23:26.859
'Cause I'm at his house

23:26.900 --> 23:29.789
and I'm looking at him
right now.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.138
Are you saying he's
in police custody?

23:32.170 --> 23:33.831
Technically, yeah.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.404
He's all ours.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.780
Mailman saw the body
through the window.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.788
Calls 911,

23:46.820 --> 23:49.459
said he thought someone
on his route had killed himself.

23:50.830 --> 23:51.979
Turns out
he was right.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.691
The gun was still
in Saldua's hand

23:53.730 --> 23:54.856
when we got here.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.221
Watch the blood spatter.

23:57.260 --> 23:59.125
We found the ring box

24:03.910 --> 24:05.707
Turns out Mantlo
and his wife

24:05.740 --> 24:06.729
used the florist
Saldua worked for.

24:06.770 --> 24:09.807
They order fresh flowers
to the house once a week.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.546
Saldua was the guy
who delivered them.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.913
Explains why she would
have let him the other night.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.941
What happened over there?

24:16.980 --> 24:18.743
ABREU:
Mixed his colors
with his whites?

24:18.790 --> 24:19.882
Who knows.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.808
Guy was a nut bar.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.183
Did you already
take his phone?

24:25.230 --> 24:26.959
It hasn't turned up yet,

24:26.990 --> 24:29.026
but it will.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.809
You wanted to
be the one

24:55.860 --> 24:57.623
who found him,
didn't you?

24:59.830 --> 25:03.698
I don't do what I do
for the credit.

25:03.730 --> 25:06.528
Then why do you
do it?

25:12.070 --> 25:14.004
MANTLO:
I would like to thank

25:14.040 --> 25:15.837
the police, again,

25:15.880 --> 25:17.768
for finding the man
who killed my wife.

25:17.810 --> 25:21.177
I would've liked to seen him
stand trial for what he did...

25:21.220 --> 25:23.814
She had her mole removed

25:23.850 --> 25:25.818
when she changed her look.

25:25.850 --> 25:29.149
It doesn't make any sense.

25:29.190 --> 25:30.987
She loved that mole.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.919
Before her surgery she turned
her head to feature it

25:33.960 --> 25:37.293
whenever her picture was taken.

25:37.330 --> 25:38.262
Where'd you
get those photographs?

25:38.300 --> 25:39.699
I reached out

25:39.730 --> 25:41.698
to Amy's friends via
her Facebook page.

25:41.740 --> 25:42.934
Harrison Polk was right.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.733
She was as beautiful
before her surgery

25:44.770 --> 25:47.637
as she was after, so...

25:47.680 --> 25:49.102
why bother?
What was the point?

25:50.280 --> 25:52.771
Another thing.
Saldua's phone records

25:52.810 --> 25:55.119
indicate he used his
cell phone constantly.

25:55.150 --> 25:56.708
And yet, three days ago,

25:56.750 --> 25:58.718
he just stopped.
Didn't make a single call.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.183
Didn't send a single text.
Why?

26:00.220 --> 26:02.108
His bank statements meanwhile,

26:02.160 --> 26:04.754
there's several checks made out
to Dr. Roland Jessup,

26:04.790 --> 26:06.189
Psychologist. He seems
worth a talking to, no? No?

26:06.230 --> 26:10.894
No, 'cause he dropped
dead of a coronary, 2010.

26:10.930 --> 26:13.899
The Amy Dampier case is over.
You helped solve it.
No.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.760
Something's off.
I can feel it.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.165
(printer whirrs)

26:17.200 --> 26:18.736
What's that?

26:18.770 --> 26:20.738
I got us tickets
to the opera tonight.

26:20.780 --> 26:21.906
Celebrate.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.647
When your father hired me,
he mentioned

26:24.680 --> 26:26.648
something about
you liking it, so I thought--

26:26.680 --> 26:28.045
I went to Le Grande Macabre

26:28.080 --> 26:31.015
once, when I was nine,
now I'm a buff.

26:31.050 --> 26:33.848
(sighs)
I'm worried about you.

26:33.890 --> 26:35.357
I think you're making
things more complicated

26:35.390 --> 26:36.709
than they really are,

26:36.760 --> 26:38.250
and it tells me_
that you're struggling.

26:38.290 --> 26:39.427
No struggle with anything.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.894
Or haven't you been paying
attention the last few days?

26:41.930 --> 26:43.659
I've been right
about everything.

26:43.700 --> 26:44.667
Actually, you haven't.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.395
The day we met
you deduced

26:46.430 --> 26:47.658
that I gave up being a surgeon

26:47.700 --> 26:51.136
to become a companion because I
had lost someone close to me.

26:51.170 --> 26:52.706
The truth is...

26:52.740 --> 26:54.230
The truth is that you
made a mistake

26:54.280 --> 26:57.704
during a surgery that cost
a patient his life.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.809
It takes years
of study

26:59.850 --> 27:02.978
to become a surgeon,
not to mention tremendous ego.

27:03.020 --> 27:04.783
Surgeons don't just leave
to become addict-sitters.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.947
They're forced out.
And they're only forced out

27:06.990 --> 27:09.015
if they commit
the sin of malpractice.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.982
I knew it would be
a sore subject so I made up

27:11.030 --> 27:14.124
the bit about your friend
to spare your feelings.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.819
That was very big of you.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.668
How do you know
the patient died?

27:21.700 --> 27:23.861
How do you know

27:23.910 --> 27:25.935
I didn't just leave him
paralyzed or in a coma?

27:25.970 --> 27:27.801
The parking ticket!
The one you had in your purse.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.933
It was...

27:29.980 --> 27:33.074
(sighs)

27:33.110 --> 27:35.146
You incurred it
two weeks ago

27:35.180 --> 27:36.818
near the corner
of 86th and Third.

27:36.850 --> 27:38.818
The only thing there
is Carver Cemetery.

27:38.850 --> 27:40.340
Obviously you were
visiting a grave.

27:40.390 --> 27:41.914
Not a parent's grave,
of course,

27:41.960 --> 27:43.359
Google indicates that
they're both alive and well.

27:43.390 --> 27:44.482
Siblings? No.
Carver is a pauper's field.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.385
The picture that you keep
on your phone of Mum and Dad

27:47.430 --> 27:48.590
says that they're well-to-do.

27:48.630 --> 27:51.758
No sibling of yours would be
interred in a place like that.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.461
The place doesn't even have
a proper parking area,

27:53.500 --> 27:55.092
hence the ticket.
So. ..

27:55.140 --> 27:57.165
a surgeon who's
no longer a surgeon,

27:57.200 --> 27:58.929
a parking violation incurred
outside poor man's cemetery,

27:58.970 --> 28:00.938
and two parents who are as
moneyed as they are alive.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.971
You add it all up.
What does it say?

28:04.350 --> 28:06.705
You were visiting
the grave of the man

28:06.750 --> 28:09.844
that you let die
on your operating table.

28:13.190 --> 28:14.953
It's so incredible,

28:14.990 --> 28:17.288
the way that you can...

28:17.320 --> 28:20.255
solve people
just by looking at them.

28:22.060 --> 28:24.369
I noticed you don't have
any mirrors around here.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.265
And what's that
supposed to mean?

28:26.300 --> 28:30.066
It means I think you know
a lost cause when you see one.

28:33.410 --> 28:36.834
Tomorrow I'll arrange
for a new companion,

28:36.880 --> 28:39.075
but tonight I've got plans.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.031
Here you go.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.264
Everything your
dead shrink

29:02.300 --> 29:05.133
had on my dead friend.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.468
You can thank me.

29:07.510 --> 29:09.330
It's dusty.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.371
The guy's been dead
almost two years.

29:11.410 --> 29:14.049
His widow had all
his stuff in storage.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.913
You're lucky she even
let me take a look.

29:16.950 --> 29:18.486
According to this,
Saldua never told him

29:18.520 --> 29:20.442
about the attack on
Eileen Renfro.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.412
Just that he had an obsession
with redhead women,

29:22.460 --> 29:24.382
and a tendency
towards violence.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.954
Want something?

29:25.990 --> 29:28.458
"Mr. Saldua, now obsessed
with his own recovery,

29:28.500 --> 29:30.491
"has taken to recording
our sessions with his phone,

29:30.530 --> 29:32.521
so he can listen _
to them again and again."

29:37.200 --> 29:38.360
Has the phone
turned up yet?

29:38.410 --> 29:40.207
No.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.878
I'm starting to think
he lost it.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.309
Listen, I got
to take a leak.

29:43.340 --> 29:44.978
Keep an eye on
this coat, will ya?

29:50.580 --> 29:54.186
MAN (over TV): God, it feels
good! Whether it's me,

29:54.220 --> 29:55.312
or both of us...

29:55.360 --> 29:57.510
your ass is mine!

30:01.860 --> 30:03.862
You're both dead!

30:05.530 --> 30:08.192
Rage.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.299
He felt rage.

30:12.170 --> 30:14.172
(singing opera)

30:23.450 --> 30:25.145
(whispers):
Watson!

30:29.060 --> 30:31.449
(whispers):
Watson!

30:39.330 --> 30:40.934
Excuse me.
Oh, my foot!

30:40.970 --> 30:42.369
Excuse me.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.234
Peter Saldua felt rage

30:49.280 --> 30:51.145
the night he killed
Amy Dampier.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.340
Now he had some
measure of control...

30:52.380 --> 30:53.972
You're not here right
now. I don't see you.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.214
I don't hear you...
Shall I speak up?!

30:58.920 --> 31:01.582
He had some measure of control

31:01.620 --> 31:03.451
with Eileen Renfro,
but not with her.

31:03.490 --> 31:05.526
Why?

31:05.560 --> 31:08.120
Tell me, what exactly,

31:08.160 --> 31:10.253
does a Xanax tablet
look like?

31:10.300 --> 31:12.120
Small, white, ovular-- why?

31:12.170 --> 31:15.264
(line ringing)

31:18.210 --> 31:19.939
Detective Abreu, please.

31:19.970 --> 31:21.005
Shh.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.928
"Shh" yourself.

31:22.980 --> 31:25.448
Not even on key.

31:25.480 --> 31:29.439
(phone rings)

31:29.480 --> 31:30.572
Abreu.

31:30.620 --> 31:31.985
It's Sherlock Holmes.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.385
Make it quick, Prince Charles.

31:33.420 --> 31:34.557
I was just on my way out.

31:34.590 --> 31:36.558
The pile vial from Saldua's
desk, I know it was taken

31:36.590 --> 31:38.353
into evidence.
I need you to find it for me.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.548
Hold on.

31:44.030 --> 31:45.327
Now what?

31:45.370 --> 31:47.224
The pills inside should be
white and ovular,

31:47.270 --> 31:50.068
but they're not, are they?
They're round and pink.

31:51.970 --> 31:52.959
How did you know?

31:54.310 --> 31:56.005
(click, dial tone)

31:56.040 --> 31:58.679
I need a ride, right now.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.974
I'm in the middle
of something.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.284
You were right
the other day.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.981
About Eileen Renfro.

32:09.020 --> 32:12.148
I had no idea she would respond
to you the way that she did.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.727
I just told you I did
because I was embarrassed

32:14.760 --> 32:16.352
I'd lost my temper.

32:18.030 --> 32:21.090
Would I have gotten
to the truth some other way?

32:21.140 --> 32:22.289
Of course, but...

32:22.340 --> 32:24.399
you got me there faster.

32:28.310 --> 32:30.676
how fast can you get me
to Sanbridge Hospital?

32:36.050 --> 32:38.211
(car alarm chirps)

32:48.230 --> 32:49.492
You were Peter Saldua's

32:49.530 --> 32:52.067
last therapist,
weren't you?

32:52.100 --> 32:53.169
You started treating him, what,
18 months ago?

32:53.200 --> 32:55.464
Probably just a few weeks
before you talked your wife

32:55.500 --> 32:56.694
into all that plastic surgery.

32:56.740 --> 32:58.162
Excuse me?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.268
Saldua wanted to fix himself.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.301
Dr. Jessup
was his first attempt.

33:01.340 --> 33:02.500
You were his second.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.770
It's quite a bit
of luck, that.

33:04.810 --> 33:07.472
You, a man with a wife
he wanted dead,

33:07.510 --> 33:09.319
stumbling across him,

33:09.350 --> 33:11.113
a man with an obsessive
personality

33:11.150 --> 33:12.447
and a history of violence.
Hmm.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.355
Only problem was, of course,

33:14.390 --> 33:16.779
Amy didn't fit his victim
profile, did she?

33:16.820 --> 33:18.549
But you accounted for that
by pressuring her

33:18.590 --> 33:21.354
to alter her appearance
until she did.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.652
Mr. Holmes, right?
We met the other day?

33:23.700 --> 33:25.019
Yeah. The pill vial

33:25.070 --> 33:26.765
from Saldua's home
came from you.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.495
Sample from the hospital,
no doubt.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.236
Almost impossible
to trace.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.261
He thought he was taking
tranquilizers, but he wasn't,

33:33.310 --> 33:35.232
was he?
He was taking a steroid.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.770
You were whipping him
into a killing frenzy.

33:36.810 --> 33:39.074
A frenzy that only made him
more and more confused,

33:39.110 --> 33:43.046
more violent,

33:43.080 --> 33:45.310
more likely to give in
to his terrible compulsions.

33:45.350 --> 33:48.581
I never even heard
the name Peter Saldua

33:48.620 --> 33:50.713
until the police told me he was
the man who killed Amy.

33:50.760 --> 33:51.829
Bollocks.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.179
I imagine that you
took to

33:53.230 --> 33:54.629
meeting at odd places
at odd times,

33:54.660 --> 33:56.389
so you'd never
be seen together,

33:56.430 --> 33:57.727
and then when the time
was right...

33:57.760 --> 33:59.625
you took advantage of his job

33:59.670 --> 34:02.093
as a delivery man
to place him in Amy's orbit.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.732
You arranged for flowers
to be sent to the house

34:03.770 --> 34:06.068
once a week, 'cause you
needed him to see her.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.431
You needed him to become
obsessed with her.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.232
You loaded him
like a weapon.

34:10.280 --> 34:13.169
Then you pointed him squarely

34:13.210 --> 34:17.840
at your own wife.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.849
You're insane.

34:20.890 --> 34:23.279
No, he was insane, Doctor.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.153
And you took advantage.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.289
And then after you'd
murdered him,

34:29.330 --> 34:31.798
you made it
look like a suicide.

34:31.830 --> 34:32.865
You took his phone.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.492
Why? Well, because

34:34.540 --> 34:36.496
he'd taken to recording
your sessions, as well.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.269
Problem? Of course not.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.766
Killing him was always
part of the plan.

34:39.810 --> 34:42.131
You'd just take the phone
after you'd done the deed.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.345
Hypothetically, Mr. Holmes,

34:46.380 --> 34:50.771
a man wants out of his marriage
to a very wealthy wife.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.448
He knows that during the course
of their relationship, he signed

34:53.490 --> 34:54.889
a prenuptial agreement
that gives him nothing

34:54.920 --> 34:56.114
if he leaves her,

34:56.160 --> 34:59.550
and a living trust that gives
him everything if she dies.

34:59.590 --> 35:02.195
Hypothetically, wouldn't
that man be smarter

35:04.400 --> 35:06.595
in the second document
as opposed to the first?

35:17.710 --> 35:19.678
What did he say?

35:19.710 --> 35:21.473
He said that he did it.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.612
Well, we have
to tell the police.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.618
No point.

35:24.650 --> 35:27.141
We don't have any proof.
He knows it.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.287
Need your car keys.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.787
What? Why?
Car keys!

35:31.830 --> 35:33.855
What...?

35:41.370 --> 35:42.860
(engine starting,
engine rewing)

35:42.900 --> 35:46.233
(tires squealing)

35:46.270 --> 35:48.738
(engine rewing)

35:48.780 --> 35:50.475
(thudding, car alarm chirps)

35:53.710 --> 35:55.678
Yes. (sniffing)

35:55.720 --> 35:58.245
Water.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.287
(buzzer sounds, door opens)

36:02.320 --> 36:04.527
(keys jangle,
footsteps approach, door closes)

36:18.810 --> 36:21.631
I'm sorry.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.830
Not just for your car,

36:23.880 --> 36:26.872
but for the way
I spoke to you earlier.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.741
I knew that

36:28.780 --> 36:31.886
the death of your patient would
be a sore subject. I just...

36:31.920 --> 36:32.944
Couldn't help
yourself.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.309
Yeah, I'm starting to see

36:34.360 --> 36:36.214
how that's kind of a thing
with you.

36:38.260 --> 36:40.228
I assume you've told my father

36:40.260 --> 36:42.899
about what
happened tonight.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.336
I'm going to miss
that brownstone.

36:48.370 --> 36:49.894
Actually, you're not.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.909
I spoke with him, and since
what you did at the hospital

36:52.940 --> 36:54.476
had nothing to do with drugs,

36:54.510 --> 36:56.239
he's agreed
to give you another chance.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.710
You've decided to stay on
as my companion,

37:02.750 --> 37:04.889
haven't you?

37:04.920 --> 37:07.218
You never would have
agreed if you hadn't...

37:09.060 --> 37:12.928
I'm very pleased... Watson.

37:12.960 --> 37:15.394
Oh, for myself, of course,
but for you.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.624
I happen to think there's some
hope for you as an investigator.

37:19.670 --> 37:22.969
I want you to let me in
on the rest of the plan.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.536
To get Mantlo.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.265
I know you wouldn't have
wrecked my car

37:27.310 --> 37:30.370
unless it was part
of some elaborate...

37:32.410 --> 37:36.517
...temper tantrum. Correct.

37:36.550 --> 37:39.644
In that case, I want you
to tell me about London.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.658
Big place. Lots of rain.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.487
I want you to tell me

37:43.520 --> 37:45.420
about what happened
to you in London.

37:45.460 --> 37:46.984
Why is it so important to you?

37:47.030 --> 37:48.691
Because if I'm gonna stay
with you,

37:48.730 --> 37:49.890
I need to know everything.

37:49.930 --> 37:51.568
Actually, you don't need
to know anything

37:51.600 --> 37:53.397
other than
that I'm a recovering addict.

37:53.430 --> 37:55.295
You want to know about London
because you think

37:55.340 --> 37:57.365
_ it'll connect us
in a more meaningful way.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.628
But in case you hadn't noticed,

37:58.670 --> 38:00.467
I don't have meaningful
connections.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.939
Why are you smiling?

38:04.980 --> 38:07.369
Be_cause now I know
it was a woman.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.344
What makes you say that?

38:12.390 --> 38:15.052
You're trying too hard.

38:15.090 --> 38:18.389
Just like you were the other day
with that tattooed lady.

38:18.430 --> 38:22.890
All that sexist repellent crap.

38:22.930 --> 38:25.728
You can connect
to people.

38:25.770 --> 38:28.295
It just frightens you.

38:30.140 --> 38:34.702
My bail hearing
is at 9:00 tomorrow.

38:34.740 --> 38:36.731
I trust I'll see you there.

39:05.570 --> 39:07.561
*

39:33.200 --> 39:35.395
(crowd chatter)

39:47.080 --> 39:49.048
You're late, Miss Watson.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.071
That barrister
was rubbish.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.712
I need to show you something.

39:52.750 --> 39:54.854
This is Peter Saldua's
medical file.

39:54.890 --> 39:58.485
Look under the "known
allergies" heading.

40:01.160 --> 40:04.960
This was taken
the morning his body was found.

40:06.930 --> 40:08.659
Weird, right?

40:08.700 --> 40:10.190
No, actually.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.403
Not even a little.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.571
GREGSON:
Dr. Mantlo?

40:18.610 --> 40:19.474
(clears throat)
Oh.

40:19.510 --> 40:20.738
Sorry for the wait.

40:20.780 --> 40:23.442
I appreciate you giving me
an opportunity

40:23.480 --> 40:26.449
to apologize face-to-face
for what happened last night.

40:26.490 --> 40:28.515
I can't promise
it'll change my mind

40:28.560 --> 40:29.754
about suing the department

40:29.790 --> 40:32.827
over what your consultant did
to my car, but it's a start.

40:32.860 --> 40:36.023
There is, uh, just one thing
I wanted to ask you.

40:36.060 --> 40:39.518
Did you ever treat Peter Saldua
as a patient?

40:41.030 --> 40:45.000
You have a funny way
of saying you're sorry, Captain.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.237
It's a simple question, Doctor.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.875
No. I never treated
Peter Saldua.

40:50.910 --> 40:52.707
I never even met the man.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.071
Now, if that's it,

40:55.120 --> 40:57.611
I am late for an appointment
with my attorney.

40:57.650 --> 40:59.743
Detective!

41:02.520 --> 41:04.112
You know you're just
digging yourself deeper,

41:04.160 --> 41:05.650
putting this man

41:05.690 --> 41:06.918
in the same room with me?

41:06.960 --> 41:09.053
Dr. Mantlo,
this is a medical form

41:09.100 --> 41:11.921
completed by Peter Saldua
for another of his doctors.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.666
As I've told you before,
Mr. Holmes-- I was never...

41:14.700 --> 41:16.793
My assistant, Miss Watson,
was perusing it last night

41:16.840 --> 41:19.866
when she very astutely noticed
that Saldua had a rather strong

41:19.910 --> 41:21.059
allergy to rice.

41:21.110 --> 41:22.668
This is ridiculous.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.132
Hmm. As I was saying,

41:24.180 --> 41:26.944
Miss Watson noticed
Saldua's allergy to rice,

41:26.980 --> 41:28.208
so you can imagine
her confusion

41:28.250 --> 41:29.717
when she remembered seeing
a sack of the stuff

41:29.750 --> 41:31.047
sitting on one
of his shelves.

41:31.080 --> 41:32.684
We also found
a credit card receipt

41:32.720 --> 41:33.914
that told us he had bought it

41:33.950 --> 41:36.259
exactly three days
before his death.

41:36.290 --> 41:37.655
Odd that, right?

41:37.690 --> 41:38.850
Him going to the store

41:38.890 --> 41:41.529
and buying the one thing
he's allergic to.

41:41.560 --> 41:44.563
Odder still, it was the same day
he stopped using his cell phone.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.192
First, I thought
that was by choice.

41:46.230 --> 41:49.597
Then I remembered
the overturned washing machine.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.633
What does a bag of rice

41:51.670 --> 41:53.535
and an overturned
washing machine

41:53.570 --> 41:55.231
have to do with anything?

41:55.280 --> 41:56.702
I was wrong the other day

41:56.740 --> 41:58.901
when I accused you of
taking Saldua's phone

41:58.950 --> 42:00.269
after you murdered him.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.572
You wanted to take it,
but you couldn't, could you?

42:01.620 --> 42:03.747
'Cause you couldn't find it.

42:03.780 --> 42:05.645
He laundered it, you see?

42:05.690 --> 42:08.989
Left it in his pocket when
he put his trousers in the wash.

42:09.020 --> 42:11.056
But the time he realized,
it was too late.

42:11.090 --> 42:13.251
The phone that he'd turned
into a virtual library

42:13.290 --> 42:16.748
of his therapy sessions
was no longer functional.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.098
Furious with himself
and suffering the effects

42:19.130 --> 42:20.222
of what he couldn't possibly
have known

42:20.270 --> 42:24.297
was steroid intoxication,
he destroyed the washer

42:24.340 --> 42:26.103
in a fit of rage.

42:26.140 --> 42:28.608
And then he went
to the nearest grocer's

42:28.640 --> 42:30.176
and purchased a bag of rice.

42:30.210 --> 42:31.370
(scoffs)

42:31.410 --> 42:35.710
Rice, as you're apparently not
aware, is a natural desiccant.

42:35.750 --> 42:37.308
It can be used
to absorb moisture

42:37.350 --> 42:39.784
from electronic devices that
have been immersed in water.

42:41.390 --> 42:43.585
We went _to Saldua's home
this morning

42:43.620 --> 42:46.680
and examined... his bag

42:46.730 --> 42:48.721
of rice.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.921
You'll never guess
what we found inside.

42:53.300 --> 42:57.259
(beep)
SALDUA:
Her name is Amy.

42:57.300 --> 43:00.030
And, um, when I see her,

43:00.070 --> 43:03.073
I get these feelings, and I...

43:03.110 --> 43:06.045
Please, Dr. Mantlo,

43:06.080 --> 43:07.945
you need to help me.

43:07.980 --> 43:11.040
You need to tell me how
to stop myself from hurting her.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.116
I don't want to hurt her.
Please!

43:13.150 --> 43:15.380
MANTLO:
It's okay, Peter. It's...

43:15.420 --> 43:17.388
It's okay. I'm here for you.

43:17.420 --> 43:21.857
Let's try upping your meds,
see where that leads us.

43:25.700 --> 43:26.962
MAN (on TV):
...now the two-one count.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.059
There's a drive
deep into center field!

43:29.100 --> 43:31.807
That has got to be...

43:31.840 --> 43:33.159
WATSON :
Yes!

43:33.210 --> 43:34.973
A home run for Ryerson...

43:35.010 --> 43:36.136
Can we please go to dinner now?

43:36.180 --> 43:38.171
It's the bottom of the ninth,

43:38.210 --> 43:39.939
the Mets are within one,
and no one is out.

43:39.980 --> 43:41.208
(sighs)

43:41.250 --> 43:42.376
Okay, don't look at me
like that. You said

43:42.420 --> 43:44.047
you were gonna watch with me
to make up for last night.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.786
That's before I got hungry.

43:45.820 --> 43:47.242
Yeah, well, just because
you don't understand something

43:47.290 --> 43:48.712
_ _ doesn't mean
it isn't awesome, okay?

43:48.760 --> 43:50.387
Actually, Miss Watson,

43:50.420 --> 43:51.921
quite familiar
with the American pastime.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.655
The other addicts at Hemdale
would often gather

43:53.690 --> 43:55.851
in the common room to watch
the matches on the telly.

43:55.900 --> 43:57.652
They're not "matches,"
they're "games."

43:57.700 --> 43:59.019
Truth be told,

43:59.070 --> 44:01.163
I find the science of the
sport quite fascinating.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.839
All of the statistical analysis,
all of the strategy.

44:03.870 --> 44:06.862
So if you'll allow me
to save us both a little time...

44:06.910 --> 44:08.832
ANNOUNCER:
Here he comes again.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.269
Pop up to center.

44:11.310 --> 44:13.949
Intentional walk,
game-ending double play.

44:13.980 --> 44:16.278
Final score--
Reds of Cincinnati-- three,

44:16.320 --> 44:18.072
