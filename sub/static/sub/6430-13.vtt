WEBVTT

00:01.147 --> 00:03.058
<i>A long time ago...</i>

00:03.059 --> 00:05.890
<i>in a galaxy far, far away...</i>

00:05.891 --> 00:07.918
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Well... I mean... it's...</i>

00:07.919 --> 00:10.008
<i>that's... it's the
beginning of Star Wars.</i>

00:10.009 --> 00:13.484
<i>This... this is a show about
Christmas, it's not about space.</i>

00:13.494 --> 00:16.494
<i>They have Christmas in space.</i>

00:22.807 --> 00:25.390
- Uh, that's cold.
- Yeah.

00:25.391 --> 00:28.117
Why can't they just put
a Warehouse in Maui?

00:28.118 --> 00:29.781
Really? Because I love winter.

00:29.782 --> 00:32.109
I love snowmobiling and snowball fights,

00:32.110 --> 00:33.956
and oh, and hot apple cider.

00:33.957 --> 00:35.986
Yeah, that's 'cause you're
like from... the Rockies.

00:35.987 --> 00:38.716
There's no air up there.
Your brain... not normal.

00:38.717 --> 00:41.481
Really? This from a man
who giggles at "Grand Tetons."

00:41.482 --> 00:43.858
You know what that means in French,
don't you?

00:43.859 --> 00:46.474
Oh!

00:46.475 --> 00:49.475
Oh!

00:49.557 --> 00:52.934
Ooh! Ooh, it's down my back!

00:52.935 --> 00:54.506
Oh, who's...
Okay, very funny.

00:54.507 --> 00:56.308
- Who's the child now?
- Ooh!

00:56.309 --> 00:58.494
There's bombs around here, you know.

00:58.495 --> 01:00.901
You could damage my tympanic membrane.

01:00.902 --> 01:02.503
It had, like, an arc. It wasn't even a...

01:02.504 --> 01:05.299
* Sounds of the season,
now ring it all in *

01:05.300 --> 01:08.041
Okay, now this is awesome!

01:08.042 --> 01:09.991
Jingle, jingle!

01:09.992 --> 01:12.992
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13.044 --> 01:13.756
Mmm!

01:13.757 --> 01:17.522
Marshmallow! Good job!

01:18.536 --> 01:19.923
Artifacty "Swiss-miss-hap."

01:19.924 --> 01:21.694
Tasty blizzard in a cup!

01:21.695 --> 01:24.695
Hey, Claude, so what's
with the twinkle lights?

01:27.101 --> 01:30.168
God bless us, everyone.

01:30.611 --> 01:33.640
And in this corner, weighing in
at a hulking 200 pounds,

01:33.641 --> 01:35.603
would be Joshua Donovan, hanging the gloves

01:35.604 --> 01:38.589
that Ali wore against Foreman
in the rumble in the jungle.

01:38.590 --> 01:40.070
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey.

01:40.071 --> 01:41.621
All right, so what do those do?

01:41.622 --> 01:43.438
Oh, they make you see
stars without hitting you.

01:43.439 --> 01:46.842
Myka! That's the original mistletoe.

01:46.843 --> 01:49.843
Ahem! It is rather strong.

01:50.993 --> 01:51.839
Tetons.

01:51.840 --> 01:52.949
That has to come down.

01:52.950 --> 01:54.439
I will get that.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.503
So guys, this is the first
time in ever I actually have

01:57.504 --> 01:59.885
people in my life to
spend the holidays with.

01:59.886 --> 02:02.028
Figured we'd circle the yule
log and eat figgy pudding.

02:02.029 --> 02:03.889
- Oh. Wow.
- It's awkward.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.670
What? Why?

02:05.671 --> 02:07.630
Pete and I are going home for Christmas.

02:07.631 --> 02:08.428
Sorry, Claude.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.346
Aw, well, I guess it's all right.

02:11.347 --> 02:13.570
Joshua and I will just
hang with Artie Claus.

02:13.571 --> 02:18.276
What have you done to my office?

02:18.277 --> 02:20.074
I got you something very special,

02:20.075 --> 02:23.075
and I think you're gonna love it.

02:23.924 --> 02:25.116
Why?

02:25.117 --> 02:26.973
It's called a present.

02:26.974 --> 02:28.978
You're familiar with presents, right?

02:28.979 --> 02:30.101
We earthlings exchange them

02:30.102 --> 02:32.057
as a sign of affection and gratitude.

02:32.058 --> 02:33.998
No, no. Thank you but no thank you.

02:33.999 --> 02:37.000
Artie, it's a gift. Take it.

02:37.001 --> 02:39.261
Yeah, come on, Artie. Ho ho ho.

02:39.262 --> 02:41.659
All right, look, could we
just stop all this merriment?

02:41.660 --> 02:44.660
Come on, some of these are
dangerous arti... artif...

02:46.552 --> 02:49.552
This is not the holiday
counter at Woolworth's!

02:52.390 --> 02:55.390
Oh, my...

02:58.200 --> 03:00.197
Uhh! You see what I mean?

03:00.198 --> 03:03.198
Ow.

03:04.666 --> 03:07.388
Take it all down!

03:07.389 --> 03:12.875
**

03:18.437 --> 03:20.551
Oh, and dad, I almost forgot to tell you!

03:20.552 --> 03:22.935
Today at school, we had a secret Santa,

03:22.936 --> 03:25.192
and this boy, Matthew,
he got me a phone case.

03:25.193 --> 03:26.763
He's never even said hi to me,

03:26.764 --> 03:28.256
but he knew my favorite color,

03:28.257 --> 03:30.085
so I might have to give him a second look.

03:30.086 --> 03:33.086
That sounds awesome.

03:33.441 --> 03:35.725
Dad, you're working again.

03:35.726 --> 03:38.347
Oh, um, yeah. Sorry, honey.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.860
That's rude, you know.

03:39.861 --> 03:41.307
I'm all yours now, okay?

03:41.308 --> 03:43.612
Mom's right, you don't
listen when women talk.

03:43.613 --> 03:45.550
Oh, yikes.
When did you turn into a woman?

03:45.551 --> 03:47.559
Well, I'm almost at the decade mark.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.258
That's a lot of life experience, you know.

03:49.259 --> 03:50.960
Mm-hmm, yes. I guess you're right.

03:50.961 --> 03:52.071
I'm gonna have to keep up.

03:52.072 --> 03:54.450
Hey, why didn't you
make the tree trimming?

03:54.451 --> 03:55.793
Mom said you promised.

03:55.794 --> 03:58.165
Well, sometimes mom makes things up

03:58.166 --> 04:01.133
because she's mad at me, but, I mean,

04:01.134 --> 04:02.505
she knew I couldn't make it this week.

04:02.506 --> 04:03.766
I'm up against all these deadlines

04:03.767 --> 04:04.479
at the new mall, honey.

04:04.480 --> 04:08.312
I... I... I'm sorry, kiddo. I'm sorry.

04:08.313 --> 04:10.167
It's okay.

04:10.168 --> 04:12.032
Now, you tell this boy Matthew

04:12.033 --> 04:13.751
that your daddy's got a shotgun, okay?

04:13.752 --> 04:15.634
And I will be wanting to meet him soon.

04:15.635 --> 04:18.635
Oh, dad, don't you dare!

04:18.684 --> 04:21.678
See? I was listening the whole time.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.689
I love you, sweetheart.

04:22.690 --> 04:23.627
Love you too, dad.

04:23.628 --> 04:26.628
Mwah!

04:28.000 --> 04:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:39.327 --> 04:42.327
Somebody there?

05:12.615 --> 05:14.189
Hey!

05:14.190 --> 05:16.231
What... what... what... what the hell?

05:16.232 --> 05:17.853
What are you... what are you...

05:17.854 --> 05:19.518
Aah!

05:19.519 --> 05:20.984
Oh, Je...

05:20.985 --> 05:22.687
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:22.688 --> 05:25.688
No! Please, stop!

05:27.814 --> 05:30.814
No, no, no!

05:34.509 --> 05:37.509
Ho ho ho!

05:58.310 --> 06:00.773
Oh, but Colorado Springs
has this great light show.

06:00.774 --> 06:03.195
Ah, north canton has the
pro football hall of fame,

06:03.196 --> 06:04.236
the hoover vacuum cleaner.

06:04.237 --> 06:05.594
- That's not even...
- Cancel your flights.

06:05.595 --> 06:07.634
- All trips are off.
- What?

06:07.635 --> 06:09.077
- Artie, are you kidding me?
- Artie, it's Christmas.

06:09.078 --> 06:11.010
We've got a case.

06:11.011 --> 06:14.770
Well, are you sure that it's one of ours?

06:14.771 --> 06:18.189
Well, let's see. Home invasion.

06:18.190 --> 06:21.009
The victim reported... reluctantly...

06:21.010 --> 06:22.318
that the intruder, and I quote,

06:22.319 --> 06:26.028
"flew around the room in a cloud of light,

06:26.029 --> 06:28.490
then disappeared up the chimney."

06:28.491 --> 06:32.548
And this is the police sketch.

06:32.980 --> 06:35.217
No.

06:35.218 --> 06:38.218
You have got to be kidding.

07:17.860 --> 07:18.569
Poor Artie.

07:18.570 --> 07:20.438
Must be exhausting to be that grouchy

07:20.439 --> 07:21.984
without even time off for the holidays.

07:21.985 --> 07:23.075
You think he was like that as a kid?

07:23.076 --> 07:26.233
Whoa. I've never actually
pictured Artie as a child.

07:26.522 --> 07:28.162
- It's disturbing.
- Yeah, it is.

07:28.163 --> 07:30.656
Wait, haven't I ever showed you this?

07:30.657 --> 07:33.201
Oh, my God. Look at that.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.202
He even looks happy.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.578
Think he came out of the
womb with those eyebrows?

07:36.579 --> 07:38.569
He once told me that
sitting at that piano

07:38.570 --> 07:40.967
was his favorite place in the entire world.

07:40.968 --> 07:42.492
- Wait, Artie plays?
- Yeah.

07:42.493 --> 07:43.143
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:43.144 --> 07:45.640
His dad was a professional
musician or something?

07:45.641 --> 07:47.256
Taught composition at temple.

07:47.257 --> 07:48.854
Sent Artie to Juilliard.

07:48.855 --> 07:50.994
But when he went to go work for the NSA,

07:50.995 --> 07:53.038
his dad never talked to him again.

07:53.039 --> 07:54.497
So how do we put that face

07:54.498 --> 07:56.423
back on ol' crabby mcgrumpy pants?

07:56.424 --> 07:59.099
"Gluckklavier?" "Gluckklavier."

07:59.100 --> 08:00.032
Glue what to what?

08:00.033 --> 08:01.967
Oh, it's the make of the piano.

08:01.968 --> 08:03.857
Picked up a little German at CERN.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.792
Never heard of gluckklavier, though.

08:05.793 --> 08:08.143
Bro, you're a genius! We'll find it.

08:08.144 --> 08:09.764
Danke. Find what?

08:09.765 --> 08:11.612
This piano! Artie's favorite place!

08:11.613 --> 08:14.144
The actual piano? Claudia, how?

08:14.145 --> 08:16.636
We're in the object finding business.

08:16.637 --> 08:17.725
Artie grew up in Philly, right?

08:17.726 --> 08:19.709
So, we'll start by calling piano tuners.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.828
Figure out who worked on
gloocky-glockenshpielers.

08:21.829 --> 08:22.602
What are you gonna do?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.946
Search every piano tuner in Philadelphia?

08:24.947 --> 08:25.880
How many can there be?

08:25.881 --> 08:29.186
Well, from the combined
215 and 610 area codes,

08:31.562 --> 08:34.025
486.

08:34.025 --> 08:36.587
So we'll split 'em up. Come on, guys!

08:36.589 --> 08:39.051
Worst case scenario, we
rack up a mondo phone bill.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.279
But if we succeed, we give Artie

08:41.280 --> 08:44.280
the most awesome present ever!

08:51.860 --> 08:53.866
Entry key pad, motion sensors...

08:53.867 --> 08:55.358
none of it was triggered.

08:55.359 --> 08:57.966
And you say he left through the chimney?

08:57.967 --> 08:59.703
Look, I've already entertained the LAPD

08:59.704 --> 09:02.043
for an hour, and they stared
at me like I was a nutjob.

09:02.044 --> 09:04.278
Is there any reason why the
secret service needs an encore?

09:04.279 --> 09:06.837
We wouldn't be here if we thought
you were crazy, Mr. Newley.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.774
Uhh! It's pretty narrow to climb.

09:09.775 --> 09:14.418
And I'm guessing Santa's,
you know, bowl full o' jelly...

09:14.419 --> 09:17.354
No, he didn't climb up there. He...

09:17.355 --> 09:19.287
He whooshed.

09:19.288 --> 09:20.276
And twinkled.

09:20.277 --> 09:22.672
Whooshed and twinkled.

09:22.673 --> 09:24.833
That definitely sounds like
someone's using something.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.856
- Yeah.
- Absolutely not.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.711
I will take a drug test.
I will prove it to you.

09:28.712 --> 09:31.358
No, no, no, no. That's not what he meant.

09:31.359 --> 09:32.730
Believe me, guy, you're lucky.

09:32.731 --> 09:34.323
A whoosh and a twinkle is a lot better

09:34.324 --> 09:36.156
than a sizzle and a splat,

09:36.157 --> 09:38.455
or even worse, a zzz-zap and ker-chow!

09:38.456 --> 09:41.456
Pete.

09:41.571 --> 09:45.121
Okay, so, Mr. Newley,
do you have any, uh, enemies?

09:45.620 --> 09:48.564
Well, I'm rich, I'm successful, I'm thin.

09:48.565 --> 09:50.432
That usually pisses somebody off.

09:50.433 --> 09:52.559
No, I meant someone with a motive.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.400
It says here that you're
starting demolition

09:55.401 --> 09:57.479
on a new shopping mall.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.781
Is there anyone being evicted?

09:58.782 --> 10:00.565
There's just some junky old shops

10:00.566 --> 10:01.889
that nobody ever goes to.

10:01.890 --> 10:04.890
And one guy's pretty cheesed,
but, you know, it happens.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.524
Sounds motivational.

10:06.525 --> 10:07.958
- Let's go talk to him.
- Let's.

10:07.959 --> 10:09.043
- Mm-hmm.
- Now?

10:09.044 --> 10:10.433
- Yes.
- Yeah.

10:10.434 --> 10:13.434
Oh!

10:17.991 --> 10:20.174
Now remember, just slide
it under your uncle's butt

10:20.175 --> 10:21.331
just before he sits down.

10:21.332 --> 10:23.480
It'll be hilarious.

10:23.481 --> 10:25.527
All right, have fun.

10:25.528 --> 10:27.468
Oh, great. What's this?

10:27.469 --> 10:29.603
You got some fancy lawyers
with you this time, Newley?

10:29.604 --> 10:31.156
Someone attacked my home.

10:31.157 --> 10:32.893
Mr. Wilkie, secret service.

10:32.894 --> 10:34.982
Oh, well, aren't we important?

10:34.983 --> 10:37.291
Look, if you find the guy,
send me his name, okay?

10:37.292 --> 10:39.148
I'll send him over one of
my best rubber chickens.

10:39.149 --> 10:41.569
Very funny.
Where's the rest of the Santa suit?

10:41.570 --> 10:42.929
What is that, a fat joke?

10:42.930 --> 10:44.156
Where were you two nights ago?

10:44.157 --> 10:46.373
I was right here, surfing job web sites.

10:46.374 --> 10:48.430
Don't know if you heard, but I'm
getting put out of business.

10:48.431 --> 10:50.847
If you or any of the
others have any complaints,

10:50.848 --> 10:52.500
please just take it up with my office.

10:52.501 --> 10:55.325
I am giving you way more
than this place is worth.

10:55.326 --> 10:57.493
My father built this place!

10:57.494 --> 10:58.837
Keep your money!

10:58.838 --> 11:01.331
Nobody wants another mall.

11:01.332 --> 11:03.463
Mr. Wilkie, stores like
this are going extinct.

11:03.464 --> 11:06.464
Cash in while you can.

11:09.477 --> 11:13.264
Right after new year's, this
whole block comes down.

11:16.796 --> 11:17.977
Pete.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.978
Ah cha chadda cha cha!

11:22.410 --> 11:23.485
Pete, please don't.

11:23.486 --> 11:26.322
What? Stocking stuffers.

11:26.323 --> 11:28.516
My kid sister loves these things.

11:28.517 --> 11:31.092
The man's insane. He sells plastic vomit.

11:31.093 --> 11:33.588
I love that stuff.
I should have bought some.

11:33.589 --> 11:35.911
But evicting him after new year's?

11:35.912 --> 11:37.918
Not exactly in the holiday spirit.

11:37.919 --> 11:40.250
Did I mention that we're paying him?

11:40.251 --> 11:42.646
And what has more holiday
spirit than a mall?

11:42.647 --> 11:45.424
I mean, people go to my malls
to celebrate Christmas!

11:45.425 --> 11:47.853
We have Santa's villages, huge trees.

11:47.854 --> 11:50.317
When was the last time you
were in a mom and pop store?

11:50.318 --> 11:53.318
I grew up in a mom and pop store.

11:53.938 --> 11:56.333
Okay. You know I'm right, then.

11:56.334 --> 11:59.507
God, I thought my staff were in
for at least half a day today.

12:05.472 --> 12:08.854
Pete, what is that?

12:18.016 --> 12:19.737
That just happened, right?

12:19.738 --> 12:22.738
It's going after Newley.

12:27.398 --> 12:30.324
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

12:30.325 --> 12:32.143
Aah! Aah!

12:32.144 --> 12:33.211
Okay, this is happening, right?

12:33.212 --> 12:35.055
Do you see this? This is happening.

12:35.056 --> 12:36.161
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:36.162 --> 12:37.555
- Yes!
- Yes.

12:37.556 --> 12:40.556
- Oh!
- Aah!

12:52.684 --> 12:55.679
I've been watching you, Larry noodle,

12:55.680 --> 12:58.680
and I'm very disappointed!

12:59.539 --> 13:04.799
You're not being the man that they deserve!

13:05.513 --> 13:08.950
These are not what's important!

13:10.977 --> 13:14.239
You seriously pissed that guy off.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.825
Time's running out!

13:15.826 --> 13:19.624
Fix your life, or I'm
gonna take it from you!

13:22.429 --> 13:25.429
Good-bye, Larry noodle!

13:28.667 --> 13:30.058
- That was whooshing.
- And twinkling.

13:30.059 --> 13:30.963
And a little ker-chow.

13:30.964 --> 13:32.716
Oh, my God.

13:32.717 --> 13:34.583
Larry noodle?

13:34.584 --> 13:37.475
No one's called me that since I was a kid.

13:37.476 --> 13:42.263
Myka... Myka, is it... is it possible

13:42.264 --> 13:45.092
that... that we saw the actual,
real life...

13:45.093 --> 13:47.520
Don't! No!

13:47.521 --> 13:50.521
Santa?

13:54.832 --> 13:58.034
Artie, is it... is it possible that...

13:58.035 --> 14:00.323
That yes, Virginia, there
really is a Santa Claus?

14:00.324 --> 14:03.101
The dude enters and
exits through chimneys!

14:03.102 --> 14:05.660
He travels across the room as fairy dust.

14:05.661 --> 14:10.057
Look, Artie, this was the real Santa, okay?

14:10.058 --> 14:11.066
Oh, and by the way,

14:11.067 --> 14:14.067
be nice, because Santa is bad-ass.

14:14.817 --> 14:17.393
There really was a Saint Nicholas

14:17.394 --> 14:19.132
in fourth century turkey,

14:19.133 --> 14:22.665
and he was known to have put
coins in people's shoes.

14:22.666 --> 14:25.212
Real Santa! Excellent!
You know, I knew it!

14:25.213 --> 14:27.259
Seriously, it explains so much.

14:27.260 --> 14:28.477
You're making a Christmas list

14:28.478 --> 14:29.564
in your head right now, aren't you?

14:29.565 --> 14:30.476
Maybe.

14:30.477 --> 14:32.683
He threatened Newley's life.

14:32.684 --> 14:34.101
Well, the guy is a bit of a tool.

14:34.102 --> 14:35.987
Artie, is it possible that someone maybe

14:35.988 --> 14:39.771
has an artifact that lets
them take the form of Santa?

14:39.772 --> 14:43.921
Well, there are other Christmas legends,

14:43.922 --> 14:47.341
um, involving darker, imp-like spirits.

14:47.342 --> 14:53.408
Like, that was Krampus, and
there's also black Peter.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.814
There are more.
I'll keep doing the research.

14:55.815 --> 14:58.915
- Artie, where's Claudia?
- My own dark imp?

14:58.916 --> 15:00.292
Yeah, I suspect she's off

15:00.293 --> 15:03.293
plotting another holiday surprise.

15:03.656 --> 15:05.637
Too busy making money to keep
a promise to your daughter?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.662
Now is not a good time, Lila.

15:07.663 --> 15:09.006
You said that you were
gonna decorate the tree!

15:09.007 --> 15:10.900
I never said that, okay?

15:10.901 --> 15:12.342
And listen, by the way, I sent over

15:12.343 --> 15:14.462
some incredibly expensive
antique ornaments.

15:14.463 --> 15:16.011
Did you even bother to give them to her?

15:16.012 --> 15:18.150
Not really the same
as her dad being here.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.840
Look, I know my daughter,

15:20.841 --> 15:23.153
and I know that she happens
to like things like that.

15:23.154 --> 15:25.656
- She is an old soul.
- And she's getting older!

15:25.657 --> 15:27.195
Another year gone by, Larry.

15:27.196 --> 15:30.196
How many are you gonna miss?

15:33.959 --> 15:36.444
I never made any promise.

15:36.445 --> 15:39.445
I'm buried with work.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.880
Anyway, if you'll excuse me,

15:40.881 --> 15:42.367
I, uh... I have two meetings

15:42.368 --> 15:43.522
that I have to get to right away.

15:43.523 --> 15:46.044
- Why would she lie?
- Well, she's my ex-wife.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.661
- That's what she does.
- She could be behind this.

15:48.662 --> 15:50.157
I got a thought.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.836
Myka, why don't you go interview the ex?

15:51.837 --> 15:54.801
Big Lar and I will spend some
q-time with the daughter, huh?

15:54.802 --> 15:56.290
What do you say about that, huh? Come on.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.511
- Well...
- Cancel your meetings.

15:57.512 --> 15:59.299
Here we go. All right. Here we go.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.814
I...

16:00.815 --> 16:04.759
Come on, I hear Philadelphia is
beautiful this time of year.

16:04.868 --> 16:07.116
**

16:07.117 --> 16:10.524
So, as it turns out,
calling 486 piano tuners,

16:10.525 --> 16:12.303
turns out it's harder to split three ways

16:12.304 --> 16:14.946
when only one of you can
pronounce glucky, uh...

16:14.947 --> 16:15.958
Globben-killer...

16:15.959 --> 16:17.658
- Gluckklavier.
- Yes.

16:17.659 --> 16:20.354
Anyway, so we were about
to ditch the whole plan

16:20.355 --> 16:22.763
when one of them says
that this gluckenthing

16:22.764 --> 16:24.923
uses special tuning pins that are only made

16:24.924 --> 16:26.243
by this one company in Germany,

16:26.244 --> 16:27.591
so my kinda-German-speaking brother

16:27.592 --> 16:29.526
gets them on the horn,
they narrow the list down

16:29.527 --> 16:30.883
to the couple of piano tuners in Philly

16:30.884 --> 16:32.868
who actually buy them, and here I am.

16:32.869 --> 16:34.085
I can't imagine what's so special

16:34.086 --> 16:36.780
about an old piano gathering
dust in a corner.

16:36.781 --> 16:38.244
Is there hidden treasure inside?

16:38.245 --> 16:38.919
Doubtful.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.762
But stranger things...

16:40.763 --> 16:42.382
Let's see.

16:42.383 --> 16:45.735
Ha! Holy bah-humbug, Marley!

16:45.736 --> 16:47.750
- It's Marla.
- Right. I'm so sorry.

16:47.751 --> 16:49.910
Um, it's... Wow. This is just Artie's...

16:49.911 --> 16:52.146
It's my boss' initials.

16:52.147 --> 16:54.351
I can't believe this is really it.

16:54.352 --> 16:56.480
How much do you want for it?
Please say not much.

16:56.481 --> 16:58.650
Let me get Mr. Weisfelt.
He owns it, not the school.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.777
Unbelievable. Bro, I found it. Yeah.

17:01.778 --> 17:03.926
Merion Music School.
Get your butt over here.

17:03.927 --> 17:05.239
Weisfelt?

17:05.240 --> 17:08.724
You want to buy this piano? Why?

17:09.325 --> 17:10.401
Claude? Are you still there?

17:10.402 --> 17:12.834
Hmm? I... Do you hear me?

17:12.835 --> 17:15.835
Do you wanna buy this piano? Why?

17:19.058 --> 17:21.386
You're Artie's father.

17:21.387 --> 17:24.424
What? Oh. I forgot I had these in.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.510
Hearing the little bastards
bang out moonlight sonata...

17:27.511 --> 17:30.511
No wonder Beethoven went deaf.

17:31.171 --> 17:34.171
Best Christmas present ever.

17:41.203 --> 17:42.826
I... I love fruitcake.

17:42.827 --> 17:44.949
Here you go, daddy.

17:44.950 --> 17:46.276
Thanks, honey.

17:46.277 --> 17:49.277
Man, this looks...

17:59.825 --> 18:02.287
Ow.

18:02.288 --> 18:03.795
I mean...

18:03.796 --> 18:06.796
'Ow delicious is this, Lassie?

18:07.498 --> 18:09.127
I love it, it's...

18:09.128 --> 18:11.288
Dude, it's not like I baked it.

18:11.289 --> 18:14.289
Oh, thank God.

18:22.340 --> 18:26.200
Oh, my God. We have the exact
same ornament at my house.

18:26.201 --> 18:28.192
Christmas is a pretty big deal there too.

18:28.193 --> 18:30.008
Kallie loves the old-fashioned ornaments.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.905
She and her father used
to scour the swap meets.

18:32.906 --> 18:35.864
Back when Larry didn't work every weekend.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.511
Do you any idea who
might be threatening him?

18:38.512 --> 18:42.890
I don't know... maybe a new man
in your life

18:42.891 --> 18:45.094
who thinks he might be doing you a favor?

18:45.095 --> 18:48.047
There's no one new.

18:48.048 --> 18:49.904
Have ever heard anyone

18:49.905 --> 18:52.905
refer to your ex-husband as "Larry noodle"?

18:53.942 --> 18:56.998
Wow. Larry noodle?

18:57.699 --> 19:00.197
I haven't heard that
since he was a teenager.

19:00.198 --> 19:02.448
He hated that nickname.

19:02.449 --> 19:05.449
So you guys have known each
other for a really long time.

19:05.507 --> 19:07.041
- High school.
- Wow.

19:07.042 --> 19:12.073
Yeah. God, we were so
happy when we had nothing.

19:13.292 --> 19:16.386
And then, the more successful he became,

19:16.387 --> 19:19.387
the more that that was the
only thing that mattered.

19:19.412 --> 19:22.412
Larry noodle. I miss him.

19:22.910 --> 19:25.720
He was sweet.

19:25.721 --> 19:28.391
No! Oh, no! Forget it!

19:28.392 --> 19:31.398
No, no, no! Excuse me.

19:31.636 --> 19:32.977
- Artie's father.
- I can see it.

19:32.978 --> 19:34.562
You have to come with me! He's your son!

19:34.563 --> 19:36.250
My son! He disappeared!

19:36.251 --> 19:37.790
For years! Who does that?

19:37.791 --> 19:39.590
Eh, it happens more often than you think.

19:39.591 --> 19:41.445
- Who the hell are you?
- He had to change his name!

19:41.446 --> 19:42.627
Do you know he did that to protect you?

19:42.628 --> 19:43.488
Yeah? From what?

19:43.489 --> 19:44.920
Oh, never mind, I don't wanna know!

19:44.921 --> 19:47.522
He'll explain it to you.
There's your ice-breaker!

19:47.523 --> 19:49.999
My ice-breaker?
How about I break his neck, huh?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
He wanted me to believe
he's dead, so he's dead!

19:53.540 --> 19:55.540
Not yet, but soon!

19:55.541 --> 19:58.541
He's dying.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.149
That's right. Artie's dying.

20:02.150 --> 20:05.710
I came here to beg you to
see him, to say good-bye.

20:05.810 --> 20:08.810
To your son. Who's dying.

20:09.220 --> 20:12.669
Claudia, you sure you
should be telling him that?

20:12.670 --> 20:13.959
Artie's dad deserves the truth.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.639
Yeah, I agree. He does.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.589
But Artie might be a little angry...

20:17.590 --> 20:18.809
If I tell him everything?

20:18.810 --> 20:21.419
- You mean there's more?
- Oh, yes.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.420
That Artie's too ashamed
to call you himself.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.500
That he's gonna take
that guilt to his grave.

20:27.870 --> 20:30.870
- Yeah, but... but he's...
- After he dies.

20:34.630 --> 20:39.190
All right. All right, you wait here.

20:39.470 --> 20:42.470
And I'll come with you.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.750
- You are going to hell.
- I know!

20:50.630 --> 20:53.179
Kallie said you'd be out here.

20:53.180 --> 20:56.180
You just can't help yourself, can you?

20:56.260 --> 20:58.279
I'm sorry, but I have contracts

20:58.280 --> 20:59.309
that I have to close today,

20:59.310 --> 21:01.309
or else the whole deal falls through.

21:01.310 --> 21:02.669
I don't know about secret agents,

21:02.670 --> 21:04.859
but I can't just drop
everything if I feel like it.

21:04.860 --> 21:06.809
Oh, no, I can relate.

21:06.810 --> 21:09.479
I'm stuck here trying to
save your ungrateful butt.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.119
You think I worked this hard for myself?

21:11.120 --> 21:13.909
I want her to have what I didn't have.
This is all for her.

21:13.910 --> 21:15.549
This is so Kallie gets
everything she wants.

21:15.550 --> 21:18.550
Right.

21:21.170 --> 21:24.170
Oh, God, no. Please, not again!

21:24.990 --> 21:28.039
I'm giving you every chance, Larry!

21:28.040 --> 21:30.209
Every chance to make things right!

21:30.210 --> 21:31.159
Okay, look,

21:31.160 --> 21:34.029
I don't know who the hell
you think you are but...

21:34.030 --> 21:37.019
Oh, my... Aah! Aah!

21:37.020 --> 21:38.339
What is happening here?

21:38.340 --> 21:41.340
Check on Kallie and stay inside.

21:43.620 --> 21:46.620
Oh, my God.

21:46.780 --> 21:48.319
That happen a lot?

21:48.320 --> 21:50.489
Change your ways by midnight,

21:50.490 --> 21:54.230
or I'll turn you into the
ghost of Christmas past!

21:57.610 --> 21:59.309
Okay, I'm officially scared now.

21:59.310 --> 22:01.469
Can you just please...
What was the thing with my hand?

22:01.470 --> 22:04.470
Pete, this isn't Santa.

22:13.380 --> 22:16.380
- It's you.
- Me?

22:16.450 --> 22:19.450
Ho ho ho!

22:19.860 --> 22:23.210
Tick-tock, Larry noodle! Tick-tock!

22:28.450 --> 22:31.450
Larry noodle disappears tonight!

23:00.730 --> 23:03.219
All doors, vents, and windows sealed.

23:03.220 --> 23:04.779
No fairy-dust getting in.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.229
You think this'll keep him out?

23:06.230 --> 23:08.729
You're asking me how Santa Claus works?

23:08.730 --> 23:11.579
Hey, I was wrong, Artie.
This isn't Santa Claus.

23:11.580 --> 23:15.239
Santa's nice. This is... Larry Claus.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.769
No wonder he knows everything about you.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.479
He is you.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.669
What does that even mean?

23:19.670 --> 23:21.519
Artie, the last time he appeared,

23:21.520 --> 23:23.799
our guy faded, but just for a second.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.289
- That's not good.
- Oh, you think?

23:25.290 --> 23:28.279
A duplicate shows up and
the original starts to fade?

23:28.280 --> 23:30.099
It sounds to me like you're dealing

23:30.100 --> 23:33.140
with some kind of identity transference.

23:33.340 --> 23:36.149
And eventually, your guy might just...

23:36.150 --> 23:37.779
What? Disappear completely?

23:37.780 --> 23:39.009
Okay, please slow down, okay?

23:39.010 --> 23:40.949
Just who the hell are you people, huh?

23:40.950 --> 23:42.649
We're people who deal
with this sort of thing.

23:42.650 --> 23:44.659
And what sort of thing is this?

23:44.660 --> 23:47.389
Look, Larry noodle, you
either start to trust us,

23:47.390 --> 23:50.730
or Christmas Eve comes and
goes, and you go with it.

23:51.020 --> 23:52.279
All right, listen, listen.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.319
Just keep him sealed up
till after midnight.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.320
Got it. Kirk out.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.229
Oh! Where have you been?

24:07.230 --> 24:08.769
Oh. You missed me!

24:08.770 --> 24:10.149
- I was worried.
- Same thing.

24:10.150 --> 24:11.969
No, it's not. There'd be paperwork.

24:11.970 --> 24:13.699
- I have a surprise for you.
- Oh, I knew it!

24:13.700 --> 24:15.399
Why can't you and your Christmas gremlins

24:15.400 --> 24:16.269
leave me alone?

24:16.270 --> 24:19.270
Come on!

24:22.500 --> 24:25.500
Dad?

24:25.800 --> 24:28.800
I thought you'd be thinner.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.889
Would you, um, give us a minute?

24:34.890 --> 24:37.890
Well, it's been 30 years.
What's another minute?

24:39.330 --> 24:41.629
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

24:41.630 --> 24:43.059
Ow! You're pinching! Ow!

24:43.060 --> 24:45.599
What have you done?
And what gives you the right?

24:45.600 --> 24:47.049
I thought you wanted to see him.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.269
You wrote him that song.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.709
Song... noct... the piano nocturne?

24:50.710 --> 24:54.749
I would have contacted him in my own time!

24:54.750 --> 24:56.149
He's even older than you are.

24:56.150 --> 24:57.579
How much time you think you have?

24:57.580 --> 24:58.499
You know what you're gonna do...

24:58.500 --> 25:00.099
You're gonna undo whatever it is you did.

25:00.100 --> 25:03.130
- Artie, he's dying.
- Holy mother of God.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.199
Joshua knows too.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.419
He's... he's dying, and he
wants to make things right.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.209
He doesn't wanna take
this guilt to his grave,

25:12.210 --> 25:14.059
that he pushed you away.

25:14.060 --> 25:17.060
Go in there and talk to him.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.640
Dad?

25:40.250 --> 25:43.250
It's... it's good to see you.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.549
We... we brought "glucky."

25:47.550 --> 25:50.960
I-I see. Thank... thanks.

25:52.630 --> 25:55.630
Heh. You little pisher.

26:00.750 --> 26:03.750
Ah!

26:19.840 --> 26:22.840
California Christmas. Yech.

26:23.310 --> 26:26.310
And then there's this guy.

26:26.570 --> 26:29.449
You know, I think about my dad.

26:29.450 --> 26:31.069
If he'd had the chance,
he'd have been there

26:31.070 --> 26:34.070
for every birthday, every Christmas,

26:34.310 --> 26:37.089
every morning I woke up.

26:37.090 --> 26:40.280
This guy, he has no idea what he has.

26:41.590 --> 26:43.899
My dad was a lot like him.

26:43.900 --> 26:46.569
He was busy. Never home.

26:46.570 --> 26:49.570
Funny thing is, now that we
have a good relationship,

26:50.240 --> 26:53.240
I'm the one that's too busy.

26:53.260 --> 26:56.260
Cat's in the cradle, huh?

27:07.470 --> 27:09.119
Hey, how are you doing?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.779
- Hi.
- Is he here? Where is he?

27:10.780 --> 27:12.299
What... what... what are you doing here?

27:12.300 --> 27:13.309
You called me!

27:13.310 --> 27:14.619
Who knew you had a sense of humor?

27:14.620 --> 27:16.209
Newley, get back in the safe room.

27:16.210 --> 27:17.599
- What... what are you...?
- I got the letter.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.819
You called off the demolition.

27:18.820 --> 27:20.759
- I came as soon as I could.
- I did what?

27:20.760 --> 27:22.249
What letter? This is... Oh, my God.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.279
That is my signature.
He's signing my name now.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.179
What are you talking about?
Who's signing your name?

27:26.180 --> 27:28.089
What, are you trying to back off on this?

27:28.090 --> 27:29.459
No, I'm not trying to
back out of anything.

27:29.460 --> 27:30.969
I mean, well, yes, I am trying to back out.

27:30.970 --> 27:33.989
This is a forgery.
I never sent this letter.

27:33.990 --> 27:37.009
Okay, Wilkie? It's time for
you to go home now, please.

27:37.010 --> 27:40.729
Okay, now, you better just go home

27:40.730 --> 27:41.839
before things just get really...

27:41.840 --> 27:44.840
Newley, look out!

27:49.750 --> 27:51.619
Ho ho ho!

27:51.620 --> 27:53.169
What the hell was that?

27:53.170 --> 27:55.039
- That was...
- Twinkle and whoosh.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.849
And kidnapping.

27:56.850 --> 27:59.850
Help me!

28:03.170 --> 28:05.069
He'd come down the stairs.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.359
What about... what about cousin Sylvia?

28:07.360 --> 28:08.639
Even she found a man.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.479
- No!
- Yeah.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.409
With that voice?

28:10.410 --> 28:12.559
Oh, he can't hear anything over middle c,

28:12.560 --> 28:15.529
so I guess it works.

28:15.530 --> 28:16.479
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.480
Well, a lid for every pot, huh?

28:21.910 --> 28:24.910
Dad...

28:26.810 --> 28:29.349
I'm really sorry that we lost so much time.

28:29.350 --> 28:31.269
I know. It's a shame.

28:31.270 --> 28:33.089
And now, with so little left.

28:33.090 --> 28:35.799
I know. Life, huh?

28:35.800 --> 28:38.759
- God's mysterious ways.
- Yeah.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.760
You know, I never heard.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.379
- What is it?
- What is what?

28:45.380 --> 28:48.380
The annoying girl, I never asked her

28:48.970 --> 28:51.849
what you're dying of.

28:51.850 --> 28:54.910
Me? She told me that you were dying.

28:55.330 --> 28:57.789
Hey! You know what I'd like to hear?

28:57.790 --> 28:59.119
The two of you play piano together.

28:59.120 --> 28:59.889
Huh? Artie? Izzy?

28:59.890 --> 29:01.509
How much fun would that be?

29:01.510 --> 29:02.319
You're not dying?

29:02.320 --> 29:03.879
Well, don't sound so disappointed.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.169
You disappeared from
the face of the earth!

29:05.170 --> 29:06.419
After you disowned me!

29:06.420 --> 29:08.499
You spit on us!

29:08.500 --> 29:10.179
Your mother and me, we worked two jobs

29:10.180 --> 29:11.449
to send you to Juilliard,

29:11.450 --> 29:12.869
and you threw it all away to work for what?

29:12.870 --> 29:13.619
Those fascists!

29:13.620 --> 29:14.929
It's the U.S. government I work for!

29:14.930 --> 29:15.679
They're not fascists!

29:15.680 --> 29:16.439
- Oh, no?
- No!

29:16.440 --> 29:17.809
- Ever hear of McCarthy?
- Oh, please.

29:17.810 --> 29:18.599
I couldn't work for years

29:18.600 --> 29:20.389
because I had family in, what, Russia?

29:20.390 --> 29:22.159
Don't tell me about the
family in Russia, dad.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.459
I know all about the family in Russia.

29:24.460 --> 29:25.859
You never had the sense
of a dog in the street!

29:25.860 --> 29:27.449
- Oh, is that right?
- Boys, boys, boys!

29:27.450 --> 29:28.949
Can... can we just...

29:28.950 --> 29:30.459
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

29:30.460 --> 29:31.629
This is none of your business, girlie!

29:31.630 --> 29:32.989
Don't point your guns at me.

29:32.990 --> 29:34.529
I'm just trying to make your lives better!

29:34.530 --> 29:35.889
Who asked you to? You lied to me!

29:35.890 --> 29:37.489
How could you say that we're dying?

29:37.490 --> 29:38.769
Aren't we all dying, really?

29:38.770 --> 29:39.979
Shame on you! You're a liar!

29:39.980 --> 29:41.909
She has no respect at all! None, none!

29:41.910 --> 29:42.479
A devil child.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.669
You don't know the half of it.

29:43.670 --> 29:44.949
She never, never, never does as she's told.

29:44.950 --> 29:45.659
No manners at all!

29:45.660 --> 29:46.639
You know who she reminds me of?

29:46.640 --> 29:47.659
- Who?
- Trudie.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.049
Exactly like Trudie.
The same... same girl.

29:49.050 --> 29:50.069
She always puts her nose

29:50.070 --> 29:51.159
into everybody else's business.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.169
Yeah, she thinks she
knows everything, huh?

29:52.170 --> 29:53.259
And that mouth on her. Yap-yap-yap-yap.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.269
Yeah, yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.109
- God!
- She not yours, is she?

29:56.110 --> 29:59.139
No! God, no! No, no, no.

29:59.140 --> 30:00.859
She wasn't even born of man.

30:00.860 --> 30:03.860
She noodged her way into existence!

30:04.650 --> 30:06.259
That's very good.

30:06.260 --> 30:08.259
Noodged!

30:08.260 --> 30:10.319
You know, she reminds me of Trudie.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.999
- That's what I said.
- Yeah.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.419
Do you remember Trudie's wedding?

30:13.420 --> 30:16.420
Remember? I'm still hungry!

30:17.970 --> 30:20.169
Okay, so Larry Santa

30:20.170 --> 30:22.429
took Larry noodle up to the sky.

30:22.430 --> 30:24.219
Yeah, he said until midnight,

30:24.220 --> 30:26.529
so we have a... have a few hours.

30:26.530 --> 30:28.249
Right. So Larry noodle's still alive,

30:28.250 --> 30:29.359
if we can find him.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.319
What are you doing?

30:32.320 --> 30:33.989
Well, he's not gonna finish it.

30:33.990 --> 30:36.369
You will eat anything, won't you?

30:36.370 --> 30:39.839
Okay. So where would his
Santa double take him?

30:39.840 --> 30:42.840
I mean, some kind of hideout?

30:43.440 --> 30:44.349
The north pole.

30:44.350 --> 30:45.719
We hope not.

30:45.720 --> 30:50.189
All right, and Santa
newley came out of newley.

30:50.190 --> 30:53.590
Then where would the real
newley consider home?

30:55.370 --> 30:58.359
Lila's? Uh, Lila and Kallie.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.269
And Kallie collects ornaments.

31:01.270 --> 31:04.270
Okay, so what are you thinking?

31:04.480 --> 31:07.480
I think I've seen the artifact.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.329
My dad got that for me.

31:15.330 --> 31:17.519
He knows I like antiques.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.719
I think he ordered them
from Germany or someplace.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.539
This picture of your ex-husband.

31:23.540 --> 31:26.739
Yeah, Larry used to dress
up for the neighborhood kids

31:26.740 --> 31:28.009
as Santa.

31:28.010 --> 31:29.329
Kallie loved it.

31:29.330 --> 31:30.679
They both did.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.409
Myka, can I see that for a sec?

31:32.410 --> 31:35.410
Sure.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.619
You know, these are old shell casings.

31:39.620 --> 31:41.159
Mm-hmm.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.160
Yeah, well, uh...

31:44.910 --> 31:47.910
I might know what this is.

31:48.060 --> 31:51.060
Have you guys ever heard of
the Christmas ceasefire?

31:51.730 --> 31:53.809
You mean, during World War I?

31:53.810 --> 31:56.039
Exactement!

31:56.040 --> 31:58.699
All right, well, when I
was in the marine corps,

31:58.700 --> 31:59.739
I had a drill instructor.

31:59.740 --> 32:02.740
He loved telling this story.

32:04.030 --> 32:07.489
It was Christmas Eve, 1914.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.899
I'm not talking, like, L.A. Christmas.

32:09.900 --> 32:11.989
I'm talking, like, Belgian Christmas.

32:11.990 --> 32:14.129
I'm talking, like, icicles
hanging off your nose

32:14.130 --> 32:16.269
and snow down your pants.

32:16.270 --> 32:19.819
And even though there was no formal truce,

32:19.820 --> 32:21.089
the German soldiers,

32:21.090 --> 32:23.559
they started lighting
candles in the trenches

32:23.560 --> 32:26.560
and singing Christmas carols.

32:26.780 --> 32:29.619
And then, in the distance,

32:29.620 --> 32:32.569
the British soldiers joined in.

32:32.570 --> 32:35.459
All of a sudden, these sworn enemies,

32:35.460 --> 32:38.409
who were only seconds before
fighting one other,

32:38.410 --> 32:43.530
were meeting in no-man's
land between the trenches.

32:45.820 --> 32:47.719
Exchanging gifts,

32:47.720 --> 32:51.159
candy, souvenirs,

32:51.160 --> 32:54.830
and lots of improvised stuff.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.689
If there was ever a moment

32:58.690 --> 33:01.209
that could infuse an object

33:01.210 --> 33:03.449
and turn it into an artifact...

33:03.450 --> 33:05.179
This would be one.

33:05.180 --> 33:07.559
So what do we do?
Go to it and see what happens?

33:07.560 --> 33:09.369
Not without eyes on newley.

33:09.370 --> 33:11.389
We wouldn't know which one survived.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.390
Kallie, why this picture?

33:14.890 --> 33:17.379
Well, I love that picture.

33:17.380 --> 33:20.129
Dad was so much fun when he was Santa.

33:20.130 --> 33:23.829
So I guess you were wishing for things

33:23.830 --> 33:27.879
to be like they were
when your dad was Santa.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.880
- Mm, yeah, I guess.
- It's okay.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.419
I used to make a lot of wishes like that

33:33.420 --> 33:35.289
when I was your age too.

33:35.290 --> 33:38.290
That was the last Christmas
we spent all together.

33:39.070 --> 33:42.059
Before you guys, you know...

33:42.060 --> 33:45.559
It was the year before
he opened his first mall

33:45.560 --> 33:47.739
and his business really took off.

33:47.740 --> 33:49.499
"What has more holiday
spirit than a mall?"

33:49.500 --> 33:50.429
That's what he said.

33:50.430 --> 33:53.519
That's where Santa newley
might consider home.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.859
We have to get to that mall.

33:54.860 --> 33:55.899
Okay, guys. Don't worry.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.209
We'll call you in a little bit.

33:57.210 --> 33:59.409
We're gonna take the,
uh... we're... the... this.

33:59.410 --> 34:02.410
- We're taking this with us.
- Okay. Bye.

34:02.850 --> 34:05.109
And just a cookie.

34:05.110 --> 34:08.110
Cookie! Okay. All right, bye.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.309
Aah!

34:18.310 --> 34:19.309
Aah!

34:19.310 --> 34:21.969
Look, Larry, your shopping mall!

34:21.969 --> 34:24.649
Thanks. What do you want with me?

34:24.650 --> 34:26.208
I've given you lots of chances

34:26.210 --> 34:28.469
to be a better Larry, Larry.

34:28.469 --> 34:30.449
And you've blown every one.

34:30.449 --> 34:33.449
I'm the man they need, not you!

34:33.630 --> 34:36.630
You never keep my promises!

34:37.489 --> 34:41.089
You... you promised that
I'd help trim the tree.

34:41.090 --> 34:43.829
Would that have been so hard?

34:43.830 --> 34:45.629
And you sent that letter to Wilkie.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.349
So you could do the right thing.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.268
But you never do!

34:49.270 --> 34:52.270
People deserve better from you, Larry.

34:52.510 --> 34:55.510
Kallie deserves a father who is there.

34:56.530 --> 35:00.310
Now she's going to get one.

35:03.930 --> 35:05.029
Aah!

35:05.030 --> 35:06.989
What are you doing with...
What is this?

35:06.990 --> 35:09.329
In a few minutes, you will be gone

35:09.330 --> 35:12.330
and then I'll be real.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.720
No! No!

35:18.920 --> 35:21.920
Good-bye, Larry noodle! Good-bye!

35:24.620 --> 35:27.620
You gotta admit, the guy's
got Christmas spirit.

35:28.050 --> 35:29.779
Come on.

35:29.780 --> 35:32.089
Help! He's making me disappear!

35:32.090 --> 35:34.329
Okay, so we know the tesla won't work.

35:34.330 --> 35:35.499
The last time newley faded,

35:35.500 --> 35:37.029
I touched his arm and he came back.

35:37.030 --> 35:39.079
So human contact stops the process.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.089
You... you grab newley.
I'll bag the ornament.

35:41.090 --> 35:44.090
Okay.

35:53.160 --> 35:56.160
Oh, look, Santa's little army.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
Aren't they cute?

36:00.230 --> 36:02.849
Right. Nutcracker.

36:02.850 --> 36:06.020
Pete? Pete! Okay, wait!

36:09.310 --> 36:11.979
Okay, hold your fire.

36:11.980 --> 36:14.980
Newley, brace yourself.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.720
Gaah!

36:21.880 --> 36:22.689
Nothing.

36:22.690 --> 36:23.849
What was that?

36:23.850 --> 36:26.850
That was plan "a" not working.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.389
That was the ornament you sent Kallie.

36:30.390 --> 36:33.419
She wished this... this Santa into being.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.809
Kallie wished for me to replace him.

36:35.810 --> 36:38.139
No, no, she wished for
the dad that she knew

36:38.140 --> 36:40.879
before you became all about work and money.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.309
I did it for her! She doesn't understand!

36:43.310 --> 36:44.609
She's just a little girl!

36:44.610 --> 36:47.489
All she knows is that you are not there.

36:47.490 --> 36:48.799
There just isn't enough time.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.109
Well, you should have made the time!

36:51.110 --> 36:53.259
The world will be a better place with me

36:53.260 --> 36:55.439
instead of you, Larry!

36:55.440 --> 36:57.989
Kallie will have a better father!

36:57.990 --> 37:00.990
No!

37:02.990 --> 37:04.759
Leave my dad alone!

37:04.760 --> 37:07.760
Kallie!

37:08.280 --> 37:09.799
How did she do that?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.659
She's a kid. It's Christmas.

37:12.660 --> 37:14.749
He'll never change, Kallie.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.099
He'll never make the time for you.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.539
I don't care!

37:17.540 --> 37:19.259
I want him no matter how he is!

37:19.260 --> 37:20.989
Even if he never comes over!

37:20.990 --> 37:22.869
Don't you hurt him!

37:22.870 --> 37:24.449
Please, you've got to
give me one more chance.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.119
- Please!
- Stop it!

37:26.120 --> 37:28.989
- This is my fault!
- Oh, Kallie, honey.

37:28.990 --> 37:30.499
It's not your fault. I did this.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.869
I did this to myself. To us.

37:31.870 --> 37:33.209
It's my fault!

37:33.210 --> 37:34.459
I never meant this to happen.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.329
It's just that I...

37:36.330 --> 37:39.740
Aw, hell, what good is money
if I'm never there, huh?

37:40.240 --> 37:42.339
You keep growing up,

37:42.340 --> 37:44.599
and if I'm not part of your life,

37:44.600 --> 37:46.759
if I'm just the guy who pays the bills,

37:46.760 --> 37:47.769
who jokes with you online,

37:47.770 --> 37:51.120
then I might as well just f-f-fade away.

37:52.810 --> 37:55.810
I don't want to fade away.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.509
I want to be there for you.

37:59.510 --> 38:02.510
I want to be the dad you remember.

38:03.370 --> 38:06.370
More than anything.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.739
Now, Kallie! Your dad needs a hug!

38:09.740 --> 38:12.429
Daddy!

38:12.430 --> 38:15.430
Daddy!

38:24.520 --> 38:27.520
Oh, sweetie.

38:33.390 --> 38:34.669
Come on, Myka!

38:34.670 --> 38:36.449
What'd ya get me, what'd ya
get me, what'd ya get me?

38:36.450 --> 38:37.949
No, no, and no.

38:37.950 --> 38:41.359
We are not opening our
gifts until after dinner!

38:41.360 --> 38:43.179
But I told you what I got you!

38:43.180 --> 38:45.479
I know. Why would you do that?

38:45.480 --> 38:48.480
Do you like it? Do you like it?
Do you like it?

38:51.880 --> 38:53.549
I'm wearing your coat.

38:53.550 --> 38:55.559
Captain Nemo!

38:55.560 --> 38:57.269
I'm freezing.

38:57.270 --> 38:59.459
You are supposed to button it.

38:59.460 --> 39:02.460
Oh.

39:04.780 --> 39:07.169
I thought the buttons were decorative.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.329
Yeah, well, on you, all
buttons are decorative.

39:09.330 --> 39:10.059
Okay, you know what?

39:10.060 --> 39:11.989
No, no, no, you're right, as always.

39:11.990 --> 39:15.080
I will buy you some long
Johns to wear under.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.709
I smell turkey.

39:17.710 --> 39:20.629
My turkey. My turkey!

39:20.630 --> 39:22.049
- Son.
- Dad.

39:22.050 --> 39:23.499
- Yeah?
- Listen.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.500
I just... I want you to know,

39:26.640 --> 39:28.929
the work that I did and,
you know, I'm still doing,

39:28.930 --> 39:30.069
it's good work, dad,

39:30.070 --> 39:31.329
and there's a lot of people better off...

39:31.330 --> 39:32.620
Arthur, Arthur!

39:32.621 --> 39:35.890
You told me it was necessary.
I believe you.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.739
Good, because when we started this...

39:37.740 --> 39:40.209
Arthur, enough.
You're already getting an "a."

39:40.210 --> 39:42.189
You want to work yourself down to a "b"?

39:42.190 --> 39:43.329
All right.

39:43.330 --> 39:45.529
You see,

39:45.530 --> 39:50.290
it was when you walked away from music,

39:50.630 --> 39:51.879
that was hard.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.209
No, I didn't walk...

39:54.210 --> 39:58.059
Walk away from music.

39:58.060 --> 40:01.060
I brought this to... Remember?

40:01.250 --> 40:02.289
Yeah.

40:02.290 --> 40:05.249
Look at the back.

40:05.250 --> 40:07.539
- See, I...
- Finished it.

40:07.540 --> 40:09.309
Yeah.

40:09.310 --> 40:10.259
Well, now.

40:10.260 --> 40:11.849
Now you must play it.

40:11.850 --> 40:13.649
No, no, no, not now. Now?

40:13.650 --> 40:14.759
Well, when else?

40:14.760 --> 40:17.399
You want to wait another 30 years?

40:17.400 --> 40:18.219
All right, all right.

40:18.220 --> 40:19.099
Now, you've got to remember,

40:19.100 --> 40:20.679
it's a work in progress, so...

40:20.680 --> 40:23.639
Yes, it's always a work in progress.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.579
Progress is what it's all made of.

40:25.580 --> 40:28.580
All right.

40:47.090 --> 40:49.479
Your fingering, it's still a nightmare.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.769
Dad, dad, I wrote this!

40:51.770 --> 40:53.659
Yeah. Shakespeare wrote plays.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.049
It doesn't mean he could act.

40:55.050 --> 40:56.979
You're ruining a perfect moment.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.449
I know, but you're ruining a
perfectly good piece of music.

40:59.450 --> 41:01.219
Here, let me fix the hands.

41:01.220 --> 41:02.399
There's nothing wrong.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.839
Here, like that.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.619
No, dad, move your hand away.

41:05.620 --> 41:08.549
Eh-eh-eh!

41:08.550 --> 41:09.719
Mmm! Mmm!

41:09.720 --> 41:11.809
Do not eat the stuffing out of the bowl!

41:11.810 --> 41:12.829
Why not? It's delicious!

41:12.830 --> 41:15.039
I don't want your cooties!

41:15.040 --> 41:17.369
Oh, hey, are you guys doing presents?

41:17.370 --> 41:19.119
Not until after dinner, remember?

41:19.120 --> 41:21.379
I know I'm supposed to wait, but...

41:21.380 --> 41:22.819
Claudia had one made for each of us.

41:22.820 --> 41:24.029
- Check it out.
- Merry Christmas!

41:24.030 --> 41:26.619
Oh, my God! I love it!

41:26.620 --> 41:28.319
- Oh, wow!
- Oh! I love it!

41:28.320 --> 41:31.369
It's the artifact that
almost killed each of us.

41:31.370 --> 41:32.829
How... Thoughtful?

41:32.830 --> 41:34.269
Just shut up and say thank you.

41:34.270 --> 41:37.270
Oh, thank you, thank you.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.479
- This one here.
- Yep, this one's Artie's.

41:39.480 --> 41:40.809
And this one is Leena's.

41:40.810 --> 41:42.149
Oh, look, the pearl of wisdom.

41:42.150 --> 41:45.369
Hello, hello, a little help, please?

41:45.370 --> 41:46.349
I got it.

41:46.350 --> 41:49.350
Artie, Izzy, soup's on!

41:53.370 --> 41:54.579
You know, I'm sorry

41:54.580 --> 41:56.219
that you didn't get to spend Christmas

41:56.220 --> 41:57.259
with your family.

41:57.260 --> 41:59.729
Well, thanks. You too.

41:59.730 --> 42:01.279
But you know, after watching newley,

42:01.280 --> 42:03.599
I realized I was already with someone

42:03.600 --> 42:06.600
that I cared about, and
that's what matters, right?

42:08.350 --> 42:11.229
Don't you get all mushy and sweet.

42:11.230 --> 42:12.639
Oh, all right.

42:12.640 --> 42:15.699
Ophelia Tetons. Bam! All right!

42:15.700 --> 42:18.700
Let's get this party started, shall we?

42:18.900 --> 42:19.829
Hello.

42:19.830 --> 42:21.309
All right, who wants white meat

42:21.310 --> 42:23.339
- and who wants dark meat?
- Dark, please.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.399
- I want white, please.
- You want white?

42:25.400 --> 42:28.879
Somebody's supposed to say
some words before our...

42:28.880 --> 42:29.869
Are you talking about grace?

42:29.870 --> 42:30.999
- We call it grace.
- Yes, grace.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.839
Yes, grace. Maybe the annoying...

42:32.840 --> 42:35.840
the annoying gentile, why don't you...

42:36.000 --> 42:37.679
Fine, you want to join hands?

42:37.680 --> 42:40.259
- No.
- Very well.

42:40.260 --> 42:42.319
Baruch atah adonai eloheinu melech...

42:42.320 --> 42:45.279
- Ah!
- Oh!

42:45.280 --> 42:47.009
But... but she's doing it wrong.

42:47.010 --> 42:50.010
No, I'm not.

42:50.160 --> 42:55.001
Tell her. You can't say adonai...
