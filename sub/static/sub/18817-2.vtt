WEBVTT

00:13.638 --> 00:14.639
-[gasps]
-Ay!

00:14.722 --> 00:15.973
-[breathing heavily]
-Oh!

00:16.058 --> 00:17.392
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.726
[shushing]

00:18.810 --> 00:20.978
You were just having a nightmare.

00:21.979 --> 00:23.815
You are not at war.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.193
You are home.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.778
You are safe.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.157
Everything is okay.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.325
-Okay?
-Okay.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.164
Except, I'm 38 years old
sleeping with my mom.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.499
And what is wrong with that?

00:44.211 --> 00:45.462
Are you wearing makeup?

00:48.298 --> 00:49.799
Of course!

00:49.882 --> 00:51.509
What if I got up
in the middle of the night

00:51.593 --> 00:53.428
and I ran into someone?

00:54.429 --> 00:56.931
Like you might barge in
on Julio Iglesias in the bathroom?

00:58.558 --> 01:01.353
You don't know
where Julio spends his time.

01:02.770 --> 01:06.524
And I need to look nice
in case I die in my sleep.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.611
Ay, Mami,  don't say that.

01:09.694 --> 01:10.862
No,  mija,

01:11.362 --> 01:13.948
if I do die, and I'm not saying I will...

01:15.492 --> 01:18.495
make sure that they do a good job
on my face for the funeral

01:18.578 --> 01:20.497
and bring a little red lipstick along.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.332
I know.
You've been telling me since I was five.

01:22.415 --> 01:26.043
-Don't let them make me up like a  puta!
-...them make me up like a  puta!

01:26.128 --> 01:30.757
[both] And my shade is Scarlet Sunrise.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.845
Okay, I'm gonna go make breakfast.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.823
[breathes heavily]

01:58.159 --> 01:59.119
This is a good thing.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.790
Don't give me that look, bitch.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.835
[theme song playing]

02:55.049 --> 02:56.384
-[toilet flushing]
-[knocking]

02:56.468 --> 02:57.927
That's two.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.221
[toilet flushes]

02:59.304 --> 03:00.680
That's three!

03:01.639 --> 03:03.182
[toilet flushing]

03:04.351 --> 03:07.354
Oh, my God, five?
What's going on in there?

03:08.896 --> 03:11.983
The first one was for pee.
And the last four were to piss you off.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.526
[scoffs]

03:13.610 --> 03:16.446
So you're basically murdering the planet
just to spite me.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.240
Yeah, and it worked.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.201
Ay,  it's impossible to be Zen
in this house.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.038
You know, it's bad enough
that you take 40-minute showers.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.832
I have to use water to get ready.

03:27.915 --> 03:29.334
Every time I show up at school,

03:29.417 --> 03:31.378
there are all these eyes
expecting perfection.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.840
And you give it to them,  papito.  [laughs]

03:35.923 --> 03:37.091
Easy.

03:37.174 --> 03:38.385
It's setting.

03:40.512 --> 03:45.308
Mija,  why are you in your uniform
before you shower and get ready?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.436
I am ready,  Abuelita.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.856
That's what I was afraid of.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.443
Okay, everybody.
Let's go. I can't be late.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.612
We're having
one of our staff meetings at work.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.113
Aren't there only four of you?

03:59.196 --> 04:00.615
And yet, we take attendance.

04:01.949 --> 04:03.826
But I've actually got some good stuff
to talk about today,

04:03.910 --> 04:05.161
so hopefully I can get through it

04:05.245 --> 04:07.539
without being interrupted
by Scott, the freakin'  bobo .

04:08.498 --> 04:11.668
You know, I know  bobo  is an insult,
but it sounds adorable.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.921
-Like he's a little clown.
-Oh, yes, he is a clown.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.257
And like every other clown,
I want to punch him in the face.

04:18.215 --> 04:19.592
But I'm a professional.

04:19.676 --> 04:23.471
So when he starts pulling his crap,
I am gonna smile, I'm gonna nod...

04:24.180 --> 04:26.433
but inside, I'm gonna be like...

04:27.224 --> 04:29.143
[laughs] Don't worry, I got this.

04:29.226 --> 04:31.438
I spent all week
preparing this badass spreadsheet

04:31.521 --> 04:34.274
and I'm gonna make it rain
informative data.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.485
Ooh, I have a lot going on today, too.

04:37.569 --> 04:41.113
They're implementing
my composting initiative in the cafeteria.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.368
I wish I could make you
this excited about a comb.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.373
Our school's waste stream
will really shrink

04:50.457 --> 04:52.375
if we let the food decompose naturally.

04:52.459 --> 04:57.380
And once I'm able to introduce worms...
triple the excretions.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.301
You have weird goals.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.387
Hey! No, she doesn't.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.348
[whispers] Yes, she does, right?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.643
Okay!

05:10.727 --> 05:14.021
Staff meeting, everybody. Staff meeting.

05:14.981 --> 05:15.982
[grunts]

05:16.899 --> 05:18.234
First things first.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.695
-Lori.
-Here.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.822
Okay.

05:23.156 --> 05:23.990
Penelope.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.575
Here. We're all here.
There's four of us.

05:26.784 --> 05:27.952
Halfway there.

05:28.828 --> 05:29.912
-Scott.
-[clicks tongue]

05:29.996 --> 05:30.997
[sniffles]

05:31.080 --> 05:32.874
Dr. Berkowitz.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.003
-Okay, any new business?
-Yes!

05:37.086 --> 05:40.089
Turns out, I've been wearing
the wrong bra size.

05:40.172 --> 05:41.799
My whole life!

05:44.761 --> 05:47.722
Great. That's... that's... that's great.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.100
Anything about the office?

05:51.183 --> 05:52.477
Yes, yes.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.187
Here's some information
I think you'll all find interesting,

05:55.271 --> 05:57.356
dare I say, badass. [chuckles]

05:57.440 --> 06:00.610
Lately, we've been getting some complaints
from patients about wait times.

06:00.693 --> 06:01.653
Oh, that's not good.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.988
Well, if we stagger our appointments
by just five minutes,

06:04.071 --> 06:05.364
we could decrease wait time,

06:05.448 --> 06:07.950
while still maintaining
an excellent level of patient-doctor--

06:08.034 --> 06:10.495
Actually, it sounds like the patients
won't get the same amount of time

06:10.578 --> 06:12.038
with Dr. B that they've come to expect.

06:13.330 --> 06:14.832
[chuckles]

06:17.877 --> 06:21.213
Well, they'd have
more time with him, if, if--

06:21.297 --> 06:23.466
Actually, in today's medical industry,

06:23.550 --> 06:25.510
it's important
we don't sacrifice human interaction

06:25.593 --> 06:27.136
just for the sake of expediency.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.805
Actually...

06:29.806 --> 06:33.851
Scott, I've been involved in today's
medical industry even longer than you--

06:33.935 --> 06:35.603
And it's easy to get burned out?
I get it.

06:35.687 --> 06:36.729
[Dr. Berkowitz grunts]

06:36.813 --> 06:40.817
Boy, such great contributions today.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.985
[chuckling] Aw, thank you.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.488
All I'm saying is, there's a reason

06:45.571 --> 06:47.782
this guy's been running the office
this way for so long.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.659
Right, Berkules?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.953
[both laugh]

06:52.036 --> 06:54.205
I like that, yeah.

06:55.707 --> 06:59.794
And I must say, I'm very attracted
to the concept of nothing changing.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.630
-Okay, but there is a--
-Great! Status quo it is.

07:02.713 --> 07:06.300
All right, meeting adjourned.
Thank you, everybody.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.470
If it ain't broke, don't fix it,
right, Doc?

07:09.261 --> 07:10.346
Oh.

07:15.184 --> 07:18.104
-Oh, my God, is that how Cubans clap?
-You don't wanna find out.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.985
[knocking on door]

07:30.950 --> 07:33.077
I have a salsa emergency.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.790
The condiment or the dance?
I am equipped for both.

07:40.417 --> 07:43.087
There's this girl... Lola.

07:43.170 --> 07:45.089
Ooh, is she  cubana?

07:45.172 --> 07:47.008
Close, she's from Sacramento.

07:49.426 --> 07:50.720
We're going out dancing tonight,

07:50.803 --> 07:54.599
and I may have led her to believe
that I know how to salsa dance.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.392
-Uh-huh.
-Do you think you could show me

07:56.476 --> 07:58.811
-a couple moves you--
-[salsa music starts]

07:58.895 --> 08:00.021
Wow, you're amazing!

08:00.104 --> 08:01.272
I know.

08:02.607 --> 08:06.235
Now, salsa is just,
"You want me.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.778
You can't have me.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.031
You want me!

08:10.114 --> 08:11.991
No, you can't have me!"

08:13.201 --> 08:16.329
Now... take me in your arms
like a man.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.207
Huh. See, I consider myself a feminist,
so I don't know--

08:23.503 --> 08:26.923
Oh, that kinda man.
Got it. [chuckles]

08:27.006 --> 08:29.592
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.219
Move those hips.
Feel the music!

08:32.303 --> 08:33.721
Show me something.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.598
[laughing]

08:37.099 --> 08:38.142
So...

08:40.227 --> 08:41.521
you are in love with this girl?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.065
[tutting]

08:44.148 --> 08:45.692
Ho, ho, yikes!

08:45.775 --> 08:48.152
Slow down.
I'm not in love with her.

08:48.235 --> 08:49.862
Love isn't even real.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.032
It's just something
your nanny says sometimes to your dad.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.621
The first moment I saw my Berto,

08:58.705 --> 09:03.000
a lightning bolt went through me
and I saw my future.

09:04.001 --> 09:08.839
The next 40 years went by
as quickly as that first night.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.259
-Wow, that is so inspiring.
-Mmm.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.136
We hooked up at a barbecue.

09:15.262 --> 09:17.473
Okay! It's time to dance.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.225
[scatting]

09:22.604 --> 09:24.647
Churning the bottle,
churning the bottle.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.107
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

09:26.190 --> 09:28.609
¡Sí!  Take my leg,  bruto.  [gasps]

09:29.110 --> 09:31.904
Ugh, I get it, we're Cuban!

09:31.988 --> 09:33.322
Azúcar!

09:36.325 --> 09:38.160
Can you believe this living stereotype?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.204
I know. It's... Uh-oh.
Oh, my God, what's happening?

09:40.287 --> 09:41.455
Oh, it's happening.

09:41.538 --> 09:44.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

09:44.083 --> 09:47.128
I think it's my hot Cuban blood!

09:47.211 --> 09:50.547
Oh, I must dance!

09:50.632 --> 09:52.133
Whoo!

09:52.216 --> 09:54.301
-Come on! [laughs]
-Hey!

09:55.511 --> 09:57.889
-Come on, now! Whoo!
-[Alex chuckles] What?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.724
Okay, I'm dizzy. [laughs]

09:59.807 --> 10:01.684
[all laughing]

10:01.768 --> 10:03.686
Okay, there goes my shoulder.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.898
[sniffles] Whatever, I needed that.
I had a crazy annoying day.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.983
It couldn't have been as bad as mine.

10:09.066 --> 10:12.444
At lunch, no one scraped their food
into the new composting bins.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.822
Even when I stood
in front of the trash cans.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.033
Zach Miller hit her with a hamburger.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.117
-[gasps]
-What?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.243
No!

10:19.327 --> 10:21.829
He threw it in the wrong bin
and I deflected it...

10:22.705 --> 10:23.915
with my face.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.168
No one was listening to me!

10:27.251 --> 10:29.420
So she started screaming
and calling everyone,

10:29.503 --> 10:31.714
[imitating Elena] "Earth murderers."

10:31.798 --> 10:34.676
[chuckles] Look, Elena, I get it,
'cause it's in me, too.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.638
In five seconds, I go from nodding
thoughtfully to lighting a car on fire.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.599
You lit a car on fire?

10:43.309 --> 10:47.479
That happened only once, okay?
And it was kind of an accident.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.941
But that's why you and me,
we gotta watch it.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.361
You know, like today,
I barely got a word in

10:53.444 --> 10:57.031
before  el bobo  started interrupting me,
talking over me.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.615
I couldn't even get my point across.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.660
Well, that's just sexist.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.661
No.

11:01.994 --> 11:05.915
He's not smacking me on the ass
and going,  "Oye, mamita!"

11:07.709 --> 11:10.627
Oh, that makes me miss your  abuelo.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.217
You wanna see real sexism?

11:16.884 --> 11:18.845
Be a woman in the Army, okay?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.472
You got a 22-year-old white boy
from South Carolina

11:21.555 --> 11:25.893
marching behind you going,
"Is it hot out here or is it you?"

11:25.976 --> 11:28.062
Of course, it was hot out there.
It was a freaking desert.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.816
But you wanna know
how I dealt with that  bobo ?

11:31.899 --> 11:33.400
By being a better soldier than him.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.195
And eventually, that's how they saw me,
not as a woman at all.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.824
I would prefer to die.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.371
Yo no entiendo cómo  these men and women
all want to be the same.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.082
We should celebrate our differences.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.543
I would never trade these for that.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.545
Mami.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.047
No, no, I agree with her.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.716
Everybody wants to see those.
Nobody wants to see this.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.303
Okay, everybody stop gesturing.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.183
Mom, I'm not talking
about old people sexism.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.352
-[chuckles] Okay.
-It's much more subtle now.

12:08.435 --> 12:11.773
Men assert their power
through microaggressions and mansplaining.

12:11.856 --> 12:16.610
Oh, mansplaining. Is that like manscaping?

12:16.693 --> 12:18.988
I just learned that and I love it.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.284
No, mansplaining is when a--

12:23.367 --> 12:26.037
It's when a man
explains something to a woman...

12:28.122 --> 12:31.167
that she already knows,
but he acts like he's teaching her.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.294
Does that make sense?

12:39.050 --> 12:40.676
What? I was just explaining
what mansplaining--

12:40.759 --> 12:42.261
Oh, wow!

12:43.262 --> 12:44.721
[mimics explosion]

12:45.556 --> 12:49.018
Elena, microaggressions
and all this little crap...

12:49.518 --> 12:52.188
If I got bent out of shape
every time a man said something stupid,

12:52.271 --> 12:53.647
you wouldn't be here.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.943
Mom!

12:57.610 --> 12:59.570
This is a real problem.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.238
The sexism I'm talking about

13:01.322 --> 13:03.615
is all the little disrespectful things
that men do that--

13:03.699 --> 13:04.700
That they don't even realize.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.997
Sorry, I cut you off.
Talk as long as you want.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.416
Not that you need my permission.
I'm just...

13:12.499 --> 13:13.918
You know what?
I'd like to hear from the ladies.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.295
Women. Females.
You guys... Not guys, humans.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.884
Wow, you broke Schneider.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.012
Mom...

13:25.513 --> 13:29.016
this stuff might not seem like a big deal,
but it chips away at you.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.601
You gotta call Scott out.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.102
Why would I waste my time?

13:32.603 --> 13:33.645
That is right.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.316
You will never win men over
by confronting them.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.777
You flirt with them. You hypnotize them.

13:41.778 --> 13:43.948
And then you do
whatever the hell you want.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.163
And then...
they will think they are the boss,

13:51.247 --> 13:53.749
but really, you are the boss.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.503
Why can't they just know you're the boss?

13:57.586 --> 14:00.381
Oh, no, they would be so upset.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.174
[mouthing]

14:02.258 --> 14:03.885
[scoffs]

14:03.968 --> 14:05.636
That is horrifying.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.845
Oh,  sí?

14:06.929 --> 14:09.681
Well, nobody ever threw
a hamburger in my face.

14:12.309 --> 14:16.438
Man, I'm glad I'm a guy,
so I don't have to think about sexism.

14:53.725 --> 14:55.227
Mi amor,  wake up.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.603
-[screams]
-[screams]

14:56.687 --> 14:57.688
Oh!

14:57.771 --> 14:59.899
-What are you doing?
-[sighs]

15:00.691 --> 15:02.443
I was thinking

15:02.526 --> 15:07.281
that if you would wear a little makeup,
you would look presentable...

15:07.907 --> 15:12.203
and maybe the people in school
would listen to your garbage ideas.

15:14.871 --> 15:16.207
How would that help?

15:17.166 --> 15:20.044
Lawyers would love to wear sweatpants,

15:20.127 --> 15:23.881
but they wear suits
so the judge will take them seriously.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.884
-Go on.
-Really?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.096
So...

15:31.097 --> 15:33.975
makeup makes you beautiful.

15:34.308 --> 15:37.436
Beauty gives you power,

15:37.519 --> 15:40.272
and that is why
I never let anyone see me without it.

15:41.315 --> 15:45.194
I just realized, my whole life
I've never seen you without makeup.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.613
Yes, you have.
My baby pictures.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.908
[scoffs] Even in those
you had your ears pierced.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.912
Oh, without earrings I look ridiculous.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.665
But  mija, por favor...

15:58.749 --> 16:01.210
won't you just try it my way, huh?

16:02.586 --> 16:04.546
I like what you said about power,

16:04.630 --> 16:08.134
so, all right, I'll give it a try.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.177
Ah!  Gracias!

16:10.261 --> 16:11.262
[laughs]

16:12.138 --> 16:13.680
Wonderful news.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.183
Elena can be
in the Christmas card this year.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.519
Oh, you look very nice.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.604
-Thank you. [chuckles]
-[exhales]

16:20.687 --> 16:23.274
-I meant her.
-What? She didn't do anything.

16:27.611 --> 16:28.904
What?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.072
Nothing.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.492
Just, if you get hit with a hamburger
today, it's gonna stick.

16:34.451 --> 16:38.039
Oh, come on, Elena, it looks nice.
You just look different.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.373
What is this?

16:39.456 --> 16:40.916
Wear-your-grandma-to-work day?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.169
[laughing]

16:43.252 --> 16:44.420
I'm kidding!

16:44.503 --> 16:47.297
You look great.
And whatever this is, good luck with it.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.092
Well, what are you gonna do
about Scott, the  bobo ?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.843
Nothing, because he doesn't matter.

16:51.927 --> 16:55.222
I'm going straight to Dr. Berkowitz.
Then I'll accomplish my goal,

16:55.306 --> 16:57.433
and Scott's burgundy-red Buick Regal,

16:57.516 --> 17:00.894
license plate 374 PCE
will remain unharmed.

17:00.977 --> 17:03.064
-Just a little more rouge.
-Ay, Mami,  no.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.191
Damn it, you're right.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.658
Oh,  gracias.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.831
Yeah, thank you so much.
Have a nice day.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.958
Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about my waiting room ideas

17:23.042 --> 17:25.419
-from the meeting yesterday.
-Hey, we have a waiting room

17:25.502 --> 17:27.504
full of patients out there
who are very unhappy.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.924
Sounds like there's a problem
that a badass spreadsheet could've fixed.

17:31.007 --> 17:33.635
When my dogs are upset,
I rub their bellies.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.762
Should I...

17:38.390 --> 17:39.766
There's gotta be something
we could do.

17:40.684 --> 17:44.813
Blue Sky, what if we stagger
the appointments by just five minutes?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.191
People would wait less,

17:47.274 --> 17:49.443
and be so much happier
when they see your handsome mug.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.570
Smart way to go!

17:51.653 --> 17:53.447
-Boom.
-Boom!

17:56.032 --> 17:57.451
Okay. [chuckles]

17:57.534 --> 17:59.995
I am not trying to
turn this into an argument,

18:00.079 --> 18:02.998
but I said the same thing yesterday
and nobody listened.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.084
I don't think
that's exactly what you said.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.627
No, that's exactly what I said, Scott.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.506
But maybe you didn't hear,
because you were on your phone like now.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.216
Uh, what?

18:13.842 --> 18:15.386
Yo voy a matar este hombre.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.638
Huh? What does that mean?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.014
I'm just thinking about lunch.
I'm hungry.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.057
Oh.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.978
When it comes to ideas,
no one's keeping score,

18:25.061 --> 18:27.148
but today, Scott wins!

18:27.231 --> 18:28.232
-[imitates gunshot]
-[laughs]

18:28.315 --> 18:29.316
Oh, all right,

18:29.400 --> 18:32.153
I need to say something. I do.
Okay, uh, Scott...

18:35.614 --> 18:40.411
Sometimes I've noticed,
when I'm talking, you don't listen.

18:40.661 --> 18:44.623
I've let it go, but now
I'm saying something professional...

18:44.706 --> 18:47.793
in a professional manner...
professionally.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.380
I think what Penelope's trying to say--

18:51.463 --> 18:53.048
Oh, my God!

18:53.132 --> 18:55.926
Stop saying
what I am trying to say,

18:56.009 --> 19:00.347
you mansplaining,
microaggressive,  bobo   cabrón!

19:02.808 --> 19:06.019
You're sexist,
and I'm tired of letting it go!

19:06.102 --> 19:07.646
Does that make sense?

19:10.399 --> 19:13.735
Okay, lot of big feelings...

19:13.819 --> 19:18.282
and a fertile area for what is now
our biannual staff meeting.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.367
Hold up, Doc.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.994
You think I'm sexist?
That's crazy.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.288
I love women.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.791
It's got nothing to do with love.
It's the way you act.

19:27.874 --> 19:29.376
You dismiss everything I say!

19:29.460 --> 19:31.127
-Oh. [scoffs]
-[scoffs]

19:32.546 --> 19:34.548
Yeah, you better be waving
at someone you know.

19:34.631 --> 19:38.719
Guys, guys! Let's keep our anger
where it belongs, with the patients!

19:41.263 --> 19:43.139
I don't know
what you're complaining about.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.351
If anything,
I'm the victim of reverse sexism.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.685
What?

19:46.768 --> 19:48.520
I'm in a traditionally
female-dominated profession,

19:48.604 --> 19:52.983
and if I had to diagnose what's happening,
you're jealous because I'm killing it.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.736
Oh, my God! That's insane!

19:55.819 --> 19:57.112
Okay, don't get hysterical.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.573
Okay, you see that!
That right there, that is sexist!

19:59.656 --> 20:01.700
You would never say that
to Dr. Berkowitz.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.327
That's 'cause Dr. B's cool as a cuke.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.120
I'm about to cry.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.373
[sighs]

20:07.456 --> 20:09.416
I do everything around here, okay?

20:09.500 --> 20:12.753
I order office supplies,
I call insurance companies,

20:12.836 --> 20:15.214
I even make the stupid coffee
because yours sucks

20:15.297 --> 20:16.798
and Lori always burns herself.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.217
It never looks hot.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.763
How about all the times you take off early
for your kids' appointments

20:22.846 --> 20:26.308
and I'm left to pick up the slack,
because [scoffs] moms are special?

20:28.519 --> 20:29.603
What did you say?

20:30.437 --> 20:32.689
Uh-oh! I dropped my pen.

20:35.191 --> 20:37.486
Scott, could you go get that for me?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.446
Moms are special!

20:39.530 --> 20:41.823
Because we have to work twice as hard.

20:41.907 --> 20:42.908
We really do!

20:42.991 --> 20:44.493
Dogs are not children, Lori!

20:47.329 --> 20:51.708
Look, sometimes I do have to take time off
because braces need tightening

20:51.792 --> 20:54.670
or because my kid's head
is a, quote, "lice carnival."

20:55.963 --> 20:58.382
But I always make it up,
and it is just as valid

20:58.465 --> 21:00.008
as you leaving early for  Shark Week.

21:00.091 --> 21:01.927
All I'm saying is we're equal.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.722
We all work hard.
We all make the same $30 an hour.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.604
Thirty dollars an hour?

21:13.522 --> 21:14.856
He makes more than me?

21:16.441 --> 21:18.944
You know what? I think I'll get my pen.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.739
No, I'll get it on my way out,
'cause I am leaving.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.865
Penelope--

21:23.949 --> 21:25.784
No. Since I'm obviously
not appreciated around here,

21:25.867 --> 21:29.037
I am going to cut my salary by 100%.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.246
I think she's trying to say
she's quitting.

21:30.331 --> 21:31.332
Shut up, Scott!

21:32.124 --> 21:33.583
But, yes, I quit.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.085
[door closes]

21:35.836 --> 21:38.046
I'm sorry, Lori.
Your dogs are lovely.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.969
Thanks for the  azúcar.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.178
[laughs]

21:45.261 --> 21:48.056
Your accent is still... no good.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.602
But my salsa moves are,
thanks to you.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.145
My date's such a huge success,
it's still happening.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.647
Oh, I can't wait to meet her.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.940
Eh, you probably won't.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.694
-[Elena] Hey.
-[Alex] Hey.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.529
[Lydia gasps] Oh...

22:03.113 --> 22:04.948
what happened to your face?

22:08.284 --> 22:10.746
Um, I took the makeup off
after first period,

22:10.829 --> 22:12.539
because people were staring at me

22:12.622 --> 22:16.460
and all these boys were talking to me,
which is the last thing I want.

22:16.960 --> 22:21.632
I don't understand
any words you are saying to me.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.092
[Alex] It was terrible.

22:24.175 --> 22:27.804
My friends were calling her names
like cute and pretty.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.598
I'm the pretty one in this family.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.602
Yes, you are,  papito.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.732
Elena, I thought
you were finally listening to me.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.734
I did listen to you,  Abuelita.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.737
And I listened to Mom, too.
I was very professional.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.364
I smiled and nodded
and was nice to everyone.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.117
It looked really unnatural.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.414
I mean, some people still called me
Garbage Girl, but I just went...

22:54.915 --> 22:56.625
When inside, I was thinking...

22:59.044 --> 23:01.004
-So, thank you. [chuckles]
-Oh!

23:01.087 --> 23:03.089
[laughs] You're welcome,  mija.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.966
So, tomorrow,
we try the makeup again?

23:05.550 --> 23:08.387
No,  Abuelita,
I tried it and I didn't like it.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.013
Oh, honey.

23:10.097 --> 23:13.934
This morning I saw what you could be.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.687
The granddaughter I have always wanted.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.570
I wish you would've said that in Spanish,
so I didn't understand it.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.199
Oh,  niña,  no!
No, I didn't mean it like that. No, no.

23:29.282 --> 23:33.537
You know, you use makeup like armor
because it makes you comfortable.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.164
Well, this is how I feel comfortable.

23:37.123 --> 23:39.167
I like the way I am, even if you don't.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.376
Elena...

23:41.545 --> 23:42.588
[exhales]

23:42.671 --> 23:45.423
[panting]  Mami,  I did something terrible.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.258
It's okay, I have a shovel.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.679
Wait, what?
Wait, what do you think I did?

23:50.762 --> 23:53.098
It doesn't matter,  amor.
No one will ever know.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.892
Mami...  I quit my job.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.144
I don't understand.
[stutters] The job ended?

23:58.228 --> 23:59.229
No, it didn't end.

23:59.312 --> 24:00.689
-Did your boss die?
-No.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.233
Was there a fire?
Scandal?

24:03.316 --> 24:04.526
Was he a sex offender

24:04.610 --> 24:06.653
and they closed down the business
because of the shame?

24:06.736 --> 24:07.696
No!

24:08.196 --> 24:10.907
I have just said all the reasons!

24:12.367 --> 24:14.953
I quit my job because I found out

24:15.036 --> 24:17.413
that  comemierda  Scott
makes more than I do,

24:17.498 --> 24:19.332
and he's only been there one month.

24:20.083 --> 24:23.754
Oh, so you quit because of principles.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.798
-Are you crazy?
-[gasps]

24:27.924 --> 24:31.344
I know, I know.
I did exactly what I told Elena not to do.

24:31.427 --> 24:33.930
I yelled, I screamed, and it felt great.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.807
But, now, we're all gonna
have to live in the car.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.350
[panting]

24:37.433 --> 24:38.852
[knocking on door]

24:38.935 --> 24:40.270
[Lydia] It's open!

24:41.563 --> 24:42.564
Penelope?

24:43.607 --> 24:46.067
Oh, hello, Lydia.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.611
You look lovely, as always.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.820
I know.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.158
I will let you two talk.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.871
[sighs] What's up?

24:57.954 --> 25:00.456
Penelope, please, come back to work.
I'm beggin' you.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.209
[stutters]
I can't run the office without you.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.128
[scoffs]
You're just saying that to be nice.

25:05.211 --> 25:07.463
No, I'm not! I need you.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.302
Five bucks more an hour.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.345
That guy.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.931
Well, he's a good nurse...

25:17.349 --> 25:19.184
but it wasn't right. Wasn't right.

25:20.143 --> 25:22.563
[stutters] But in my defense...

25:22.938 --> 25:25.148
he did ask for more than you did,

25:25.231 --> 25:28.026
and I have a lot of trouble saying no.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.071
That's why Lori works with us.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.451
That mystery's solved.

25:39.370 --> 25:42.123
To be honest, I don't know
if it's a woman thing or what.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.292
I didn't even think about negotiating.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.502
I was newly separated.
I really needed a job.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.463
You said, "Do you want one?"
I said, "Yes."

25:48.547 --> 25:52.259
And you see, he made me feel
that somehow I was lucky to have him.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.261
I even gave him my parking spot.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.431
Oh, so the red Buick is yours?

25:59.849 --> 26:00.684
Good to know.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.732
[stutters] But I'm sorry,
and it was nothing personal.

26:06.815 --> 26:07.816
And...

26:08.942 --> 26:10.277
you deserve more.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.072
How about this? How about this?

26:15.365 --> 26:19.202
What if I give you a raise,
and you make the same amount as Scott?

26:21.079 --> 26:23.164
-Plus a dollar more an hour.
-Done.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.877
Two dollars more an hour
and Scott starts pulling his weight?

26:26.960 --> 26:28.336
-Done.
-Which he's never gonna do,

26:28.419 --> 26:30.130
so let's make it three dollars an hour.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.757
-Done! Please?
-Okay.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.300
-Okay. [laughs]
-[laughs]

26:33.383 --> 26:34.551
-That was fun. [chuckles]
-[sighs]

26:35.677 --> 26:37.846
And I have to admit,
Scott is not a terrible nurse.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.015
He's good with the patients,
you know?

26:40.599 --> 26:43.018
He's got a charm
that I do not understand. [sighs]

26:43.101 --> 26:46.647
Well, he's got that jock thing going on.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.690
I think that's what seduced me.

26:51.359 --> 26:54.905
You know, all the nicknames
and the fist bumps...

26:54.988 --> 26:57.407
I guess I got caught up in the bromance.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.367
I get it.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.996
No, I don't get it at all.
[chuckles] But I get it.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.248
So, are we good?

27:05.332 --> 27:06.499
Yes.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.628
-Boom?
-Yeah, I don't do that.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.297
I do this.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.891
Are you asleep,  mi amor?

27:22.974 --> 27:26.477
[grunts softly]  Abuelita,  no.
We're not doing this again.

27:26.645 --> 27:27.604
No, no.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.564
I'm not here to make you up.

27:29.647 --> 27:31.357
I'm here to do this.

27:43.787 --> 27:44.913
This is me.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.332
No armor.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.169
[chuckles softly]
I think you look beautiful.

27:51.753 --> 27:52.879
Aw.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.173
I hate it.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.886
This is how you feel
when you're wearing makeup?

27:59.970 --> 28:02.013
Yeah, it is.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.890
Then I understand,

28:03.973 --> 28:06.601
and I will never bother you
about that again.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.436
Except for your  quinces.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.480
And I'm okay with that.

28:11.690 --> 28:17.737
You know, this is the only time
anyone has ever seen me without makeup.

28:18.864 --> 28:19.865
I'm honored.

28:20.698 --> 28:23.493
Well, one time your  abuelo
came home early and saw me,

28:23.576 --> 28:26.872
but as soon as I realized,
I went out the window.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.957
[both chuckle]

28:29.040 --> 28:32.335
I assume he thought I was an intruder.
We never spoke of it.

28:34.629 --> 28:36.631
-Are you wearing a little mascara?
-No!
