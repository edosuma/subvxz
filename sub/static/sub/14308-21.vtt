WEBVTT

00:09.533 --> 00:10.800
- SO WHO WANTS TO GO
TO THE MALL?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.800
DO A LITTLE SHOPPING,
SEE A MOVIE--

00:12.800 --> 00:14.900
- SHOOT SPITBALLS
OFF THE BALCONY AT OLD PEOPLE,

00:14.900 --> 00:16.100
HEH.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.400
DON'T JUDGE ME.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.867
- NOPE, SCHOOL'S SHUT DOWN
FOR TWO DAYS.

00:22.867 --> 00:24.200
RAT INFESTATION!

00:24.200 --> 00:27.033
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:27.033 --> 00:29.400
- LUCKY.
WE HAVE GHOST SCHOOL.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.867
AS IF I NEED HELP
BEING A SCARIER GHOST.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.867

00:34.867 --> 00:35.867
- GOOD.

00:35.867 --> 00:39.333
I SEE EVERYONE AGREES.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.167
- OH, MAN, MILES.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.867
CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR SCHOOL
MAKES YOU WEAR

00:42.867 --> 00:45.067
THOSE STUPID UNIFORMS.

00:45.067 --> 00:48.567
- WE DON'T
HAVE TO WEAR UNIFORMS.

00:48.567 --> 00:50.733
THIS IS THE OUTFIT
I PICKED OUT.

00:50.733 --> 00:53.333
- IT'S NICE.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.767
- WELL, I'M OUT OF HERE.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.733
- DON'T YOU WISH WE COULD
GO TO GHOST WORLD

00:57.733 --> 00:59.233
AND SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE?

00:59.233 --> 01:01.433
- SORRY, LADIES, GHOSTS ONLY.

01:01.433 --> 01:03.333
BUT EVEN IF YOU COULD ENTER,

01:03.333 --> 01:07.067
YOU GOT TO BE A TOP-LEVEL DUDE
LIKE ME

01:07.067 --> 01:08.833
TO KNOW HOW TO USE
THIS PORTAL.

01:10.433 --> 01:11.567
THE MAN.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.933
OH!

01:32.867 --> 01:35.833

01:39.667 --> 01:40.867
THE MAN.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.433

01:50.433 --> 01:53.300

01:53.300 --> 01:55.400

01:59.367 --> 02:01.667

02:14.833 --> 02:16.833

02:16.833 --> 02:18.167
*

02:25.333 --> 02:27.767
OF COURSE,
MY DAD SCARED THEM AWAY.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.067
I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

02:29.067 --> 02:30.467
SHARE OUR HOUSE WITH PEOPLE?

02:34.767 --> 02:37.100
OF COURSE NOT.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.833
THAT'D BE CRAZY.

02:42.267 --> 02:45.067
YOU USED TO TELL US
ALL ABOUT HIS EPIC HAUNTS.

02:45.067 --> 02:46.533
WHAT'S HE BEEN UP TO?

02:46.533 --> 02:51.767
- OH, MAN, HE'S BEEN UP

MISSIONS.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.867

DON'T YOU?

03:12.533 --> 03:15.967
- OKAY, STUDENTS,

TOMORROW IS CAREER DAY.

YOUR DAD'S GONNA HAVE

03:30.733 --> 03:32.567
SOME COOL SECRET AGENT STORIES.

03:32.567 --> 03:35.233
I'M NOT SURE HE CAN MAKE IT.

03:35.233 --> 03:38.267
HE MIGHT BE BUSY FIGHTING
GHOST ALIENS.

03:38.267 --> 03:41.467
OR HAVE JURY DUTY.

03:41.467 --> 03:43.233
- LOUIE, YOU DIDN'T MAKE
THAT STUFF UP

03:43.233 --> 03:44.767
ABOUT YOUR DAD, DID YOU?

03:46.267 --> 03:49.100

THE BADDEST GHOST AROUND:

03:53.167 --> 03:56.367
SECRET AGENT RAY PRESTON.

03:56.367 --> 04:00.667
- WHILE I LOVE THE SPARROW,
THE SWAN IS WAY MORE FESTIVE.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.267
- AW, THANKS.

04:02.267 --> 04:04.067

IT'S GOING TO BE WHITE GLOVES,
HIGH TEA,

04:10.200 --> 04:15.200
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
MAKE MAMA SOME MOOLA.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.067
- STAY CLASSY.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.567
- OOH, GIRLS, I NEED SOME HELP.

04:20.567 --> 04:22.900

I SAID IT FIRST!

04:22.900 --> 04:24.067
- GIRLS,
HAVEN'T I TAUGHT YOU

04:24.067 --> 04:25.300
THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT

04:25.300 --> 04:26.900
IN THIS WORLD
THAN HELPING OTHERS?

04:26.900 --> 04:30.200
- NOT SURE.
- YOU'RE A RIOT.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.633
THAT'S CLAY BANNISTER,

04:32.633 --> 04:34.533
FOOD CRITIC
FOR THE TASTE OF NEW ORLEANS.

04:34.533 --> 04:35.767
- OH, YEAH.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.067
HE'S THE GUY WHO CAME
TO REVIEW THE BAKERY

04:37.067 --> 04:38.533
BUT WAS SCARED AWAY.

04:38.533 --> 04:41.700
- RAY MADE HIM LAY EGGS
AND BLOW STEAM OUT HIS BUTT.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.800
OH, THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.900
- TWO CORN MUFFINS TO GO,
AND MAKE IT SNAPPY.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.567
- WELCOME BACK,
MR. BANNISTER.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.300
I LIKE YOUR SWEATPANTS.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.767
SPORTY.

04:51.767 --> 04:53.200
- I'M SO GLAD,

04:53.200 --> 04:56.267
BECAUSE I WEAR THEM EVERY DAY.

04:56.267 --> 04:57.933
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE A JOB.

04:57.933 --> 05:00.100
- OH, DID--
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.467
- YEAH, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

05:02.467 --> 05:05.500
I WALKED
INTO THIS HOUSE OF HORRORS

05:05.500 --> 05:09.700
AND LAID EGGS LIKE A CHICKEN.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.300
I MADE IT MY SCREEN SAVER.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.567
I'LL LET YOU GROWN-UPS TALK.

05:15.567 --> 05:17.700
- I TRIED REPORTING
WHAT HAPPENED,

05:17.700 --> 05:19.067
BUT NO ONE BELIEVED ME.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.333
I LOST MY JOB,

05:20.333 --> 05:22.867
AND MY FAMILY THINKS
I'M A CRACKPOT.

05:22.867 --> 05:26.100
- WHEN I GET THE CRANKIES,
I GET MY HAIR DONE.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.067
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M HERE.

05:30.067 --> 05:32.767
MOTHER INSISTED WE STOP IN.

05:32.767 --> 05:33.933
SHE'S IN THE CAR.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.567
- WELL,
AT LEAST SHE STUCK BY YOU.

05:35.567 --> 05:37.167
- SHE'S THE ONE WHO FIRED ME.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.900
MOTHER RUNS THE PAPER.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.900
NOW SHE CALLS ME
KOOKMEISTER CLAY.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.867
- KOOKMEISTER!

05:47.867 --> 05:49.533
WHAT IS THE HOLDUP?

05:49.533 --> 05:52.967
OH, LET ME GUESS, YOU'RE STUCK
IN A LINE OF GHOSTS.

05:52.967 --> 05:54.767

05:57.233 --> 05:59.900
SERIOUSLY,
KICK IT INTO GEAR, LOONY TUNES.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.200

06:16.900 --> 06:18.233
AND PROVE TO HER
HE'S NOT CRAZY.

06:18.233 --> 06:21.067
- MOM, WE CAN'T SHOW HER
WE LIVE WITH GHOSTS.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.467
- NO, WE'LL JUST SHOW HER ENOUGH
TO PROVE SOMETIMES IN LIFE

06:23.467 --> 06:25.633
WEIRD, UNEXPLAINABLE THINGS
CAN HAPPEN.

06:31.700 --> 06:35.267
CRASHED INTO A GHOST BIRD
ON THE WAY BACK FROM SCHOOL.

06:38.133 --> 06:39.467
SO REMEMBER,

06:39.467 --> 06:42.133

MY DAD IS A SUPER-SECRET AGENT

07:12.067 --> 07:15.500
WHO CAPTURES
AND DESTROYS GHOST ALIENS.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.667
- NO ONE'S GONNA BELIEVE
YOU'RE RELATED TO HIM.

07:18.667 --> 07:21.300
- OF COURSE THEY WILL.

07:21.300 --> 07:24.067
WE HAVE IDENTICAL BICEPS.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.400
- WOW, IT'S LIKE

NOBODY.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.567

07:45.833 --> 07:47.233
I'M JUST A KID LOOKING FORWARD

07:47.233 --> 07:50.467
TO A FUN DAY OF LEARNING.

07:50.467 --> 07:51.767

07:51.767 --> 07:52.800
I'M A PARENT.

IF ANYTHING STRANGE

07:56.100 --> 07:57.800

07:57.800 --> 07:59.633
NOTHING GETS PAST ME, LOUIE.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.500
NOTHING.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.067

- GREAT IDEA,

08:17.133 --> 08:19.133
EXCEPT GHOSTS DON'T SHOWER.

08:19.133 --> 08:21.767

10:39.100 --> 10:40.567
YOU FORGOT TO TELL ME.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.700
- NO!

10:44.933 --> 10:47.600
- MR. PRESTON,
A GRATEFUL NATION

10:47.600 --> 10:50.867
SENDS ITS THANKS.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.267
- OKAY.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.167
- LOUIS, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT YOUR DAD TO COME.

10:55.167 --> 10:56.900
THIS IS TOO COOL.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.833
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS IN HIS CASE?

10:58.833 --> 11:01.933
PROBABLY HIS LASER BLASTER.

11:01.933 --> 11:04.167
- I'M SO DOOMED.

11:04.167 --> 11:08.467
- EVERYONE, PLEASE WELCOME
AGENT PRESTON.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.833
- THANK YOU.

11:11.833 --> 11:14.133
ACTUALLY, IT'S RAY PRESTON.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.133
HEY, KIDS.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.200
I'M LOUIE'S DAD,

11:16.200 --> 11:17.600
AND MY FIRST QUESTION TODAY IS,

11:17.600 --> 11:22.233
CAN ANYONE TELL ME
WHAT A WOODWIND IS?

11:22.233 --> 11:24.567
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
I'M HERE.

11:24.567 --> 11:25.567
A WOODWIND IS--

11:25.567 --> 11:26.767
- EXCUSE ME.

11:26.767 --> 11:27.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:28.833 --> 11:30.300
- IT'S JUST THAT THE KIDS

11:30.300 --> 11:32.333
REALLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR SECRET AGENT JOB.

11:33.933 --> 11:37.067
- HOW YOU FIGHT GHOST ALIENS
FROM OTHER PLANETS.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.067
LOUIE'S TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT.

11:39.067 --> 11:44.833
HIS STORIES GAVE ME CHILLS.

11:46.833 --> 11:47.833
FIRE ALARM!

11:47.833 --> 11:48.833
EVERYBODY OUT!

11:48.833 --> 11:50.767
- LOUIE.
- SORRY, DAD.

11:50.767 --> 11:51.867
NO TIME.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.833
FIND YOUR BUDDY AND EXIT.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.267
- I'LL BE YOUR BUDDY.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.100
SON, WHY WOULD YOU LIE

12:04.100 --> 12:05.167
AND TELL EVERYONE

12:05.167 --> 12:06.533
I WAS A SECRET AGENT?

12:06.533 --> 12:08.067
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE

12:08.067 --> 12:11.633
WAS GONNA BUY YOU
AS A SUMO WRESTLER.

12:11.633 --> 12:14.567
- LOUIE, I THOUGHT
I RAISED YOU BETTER.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.933
- WE'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED,
GOO-IE.

12:17.933 --> 12:18.933
- GET OUT.

12:18.933 --> 12:19.933
- OKEYDOKE.

12:19.933 --> 12:21.400
YOU GOT MY CARD, AND...

12:21.400 --> 12:24.067
I ALSO DO A SWEDISH ACCENT.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.967
- I WANT A REAL ANSWER, LOUIE.

12:28.967 --> 12:30.567
NOW.

12:30.567 --> 12:31.767
- FINE.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.367
I WAS EMBARRASSED, OKAY?

12:33.367 --> 12:35.167
ALL THE KIDS
WERE TELLING STORIES

12:35.167 --> 12:37.633
ABOUT THE COOL SCARES
THEIR DADS DO.

12:37.633 --> 12:38.833
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.467
LOUIE, YOU KNOW I DON'T SCARE

12:41.467 --> 12:44.200
BECAUSE WE LIVE
WITH THE HATHAWAYS NOW.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.200
TOMORROW YOU WILL MARCH
INTO THAT CLASS

12:46.200 --> 12:48.267
AND TELL EVERYONE THE TRUTH.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.833
- I CAN'T DO THAT!

12:49.833 --> 12:52.067
I'M LOUIE PRESTON.

12:52.067 --> 12:54.767
I HAVE A REPUTATION
TO UPHOLD.

12:56.900 --> 13:00.300
OW, MAN.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.067
THIS ISN'T EVEN MY BACKPACK!

13:06.233 --> 13:09.767
- OKAY, THE BANNISTERS WILL
BE HERE ANY SECOND.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.067
HOW'RE WE LOOKING?

13:11.067 --> 13:12.200
- GOOD TO GO.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.467
THE LIGHTS ARE SET TO FLICKER.

13:14.467 --> 13:16.167
- OOH, NICE.

13:16.167 --> 13:20.400
- CHAIRS WILL FLOAT
THANKS TO THAT FISHING LINE.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.900
AND MRS. BANNISTER'S
SEAT CUSHION

13:21.900 --> 13:22.900
IS ALL RIGGED.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.133
- AND WHAT HAUNT
WOULD BE COMPLETE

13:27.133 --> 13:28.967
WITHOUT SOME SCARY NOISES?

13:30.667 --> 13:31.667
- OH, MY.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.867
THAT IS CREEPY.

13:32.867 --> 13:35.800
- I RECORDED YOU SLEEPING.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.867
YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR.

13:39.867 --> 13:41.100
THEY'RE HERE.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.533
HELLO, BANNISTERS.

13:42.533 --> 13:43.733
THANK YOU SO MUCH

13:43.733 --> 13:44.967
FOR ACCEPTING OUR INVITATION.

13:44.967 --> 13:46.833
- I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE SOMEONE

13:46.833 --> 13:49.700
THREATENED TO CANCEL MY CABLE.

13:49.700 --> 13:53.467
- INDOOR VOICE, WHACK-A-DOO.

13:53.467 --> 13:56.133
OH, WAIT, THERE ARE
ONLY TWO PLACE SETTINGS.

13:56.133 --> 13:59.300
WHERE ARE THE GOBLINS
AND WEREWOLVES TO SIT?

14:04.167 --> 14:06.967
- WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND?

14:06.967 --> 14:08.533
- MRS. APPLEBY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:08.533 --> 14:10.500
WE'RE HERE FOR LITTLE
PRISCILLA'S TEA PARTY,

14:10.500 --> 14:11.933
OF COURSE.

14:11.933 --> 14:13.433
- WHICH IS SCHEDULED
FOR THE 16TH.

14:13.433 --> 14:14.967
MRS. APPLEBY,
NOT TO EMBARRASS YOU,

14:14.967 --> 14:16.067
BUT TODAY IS ONLY...

14:16.067 --> 14:17.967
THE 16TH!

14:17.967 --> 14:19.433
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:19.433 --> 14:23.067
- MISS HATHAWAY, WE PAID
FOR AN ELEGANT TEA PARTY.

14:23.067 --> 14:24.200
NOW, IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED--

14:24.200 --> 14:25.633
- WHAT!

14:25.633 --> 14:26.800
OF COURSE I'M PREPARED.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.267
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.433
GET READY FOR ELEGANT.

14:31.433 --> 14:32.800
MAYDAY! MAYDAY!

14:37.700 --> 14:40.867
- ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT SOME SUMMERTIME?

14:40.867 --> 14:43.167
ONE, TWO, THREE--

14:43.167 --> 14:45.067
- HEY!

14:45.067 --> 14:46.067
OPEN UP!

14:46.067 --> 14:47.267
NAPKIN EMERGENCY!

14:47.267 --> 14:49.433
- JUST SOME WEIRD
NEIGHBORHOOD LADY.

14:49.433 --> 14:52.133
I'LL JUST SCARE HER AWAY.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.333
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

14:54.333 --> 14:59.300
BWOOOAH! MWUAAAH!

15:00.233 --> 15:02.267
THROAT TICKLE.

15:02.267 --> 15:04.633
- RAY, I NEED
MY CLASSY BIRD NAPKINS.

15:04.633 --> 15:05.667
WHY IS THE DOOR LOCKED?

15:07.867 --> 15:09.900
THE HINGES MUST HAVE RUSTED.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.100
DARN.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.967
WELL, BACK TO BAND PRACTICE.

15:12.967 --> 15:14.333
- WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME
GOING IN THERE?

15:14.333 --> 15:17.500
- WELL, MY BUDDIES MAY BE

15:17.500 --> 15:20.267
UNDER THE IMPRESSION
ONLY GHOSTS LIVE IN THIS HOUSE.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.667
- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD THEM.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.833
- WAIT, DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE MAD AT LOUIE

15:25.833 --> 15:27.467
FOR DOING THE EXACT SAME THING,

15:27.467 --> 15:29.667
LYING TO LOOK COOL
IN FRONT OF YOUR BUDDIES?

15:29.667 --> 15:31.200
NO.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.833
THIS SITUATION
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...

15:34.833 --> 15:36.100
ISN'T IT?

15:36.100 --> 15:37.367
- NO, BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO ARGUE

15:37.367 --> 15:38.567
BECAUSE I'M ELEGANT, RAY.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.333
I'M ELEGANT!

15:43.433 --> 15:47.233
- GENTLEMEN,
THE GHOST GROOMER 3000.

15:47.233 --> 15:52.067
IT'LL LEAVE YOUR FORM
FEELING CLEAN AND WARM.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.333
WHO WANTS TO TRY IT OUT FIRST?

15:53.333 --> 15:55.467
- MILES,
THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.800
- I'M SENSING SOME RESERVATIONS.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.367
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

16:03.433 --> 16:04.900
SEE, I'M CLEANER ALREADY.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.067
UH, HEY,
HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH!

16:06.067 --> 16:08.733
HELP! AHH!
MAKE IT STOP!

16:12.933 --> 16:15.233
AH, REFRESHING.

16:15.233 --> 16:16.800
- NO WAY I'D GET IN THAT THING.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.567
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALIEN.

16:20.733 --> 16:22.333
- I SAID IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALIEN.

16:22.333 --> 16:25.067
NOW, I LOVE THESE SWAN NAPKINS.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.500
THIS IS VERY CLASSY.

16:29.433 --> 16:32.933
- OKAY, WE HAVE A TEA PARTY
TO PUT ON.

16:32.933 --> 16:34.267
- MOM, I THOUGHT WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE

16:34.267 --> 16:36.200
GETTING CLAY HIS LIFE BACK.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.067
- YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO HELPING OTHERS

16:38.067 --> 16:40.100
AND MAKING THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE?

16:40.100 --> 16:42.833
- WE'LL TAKE SHORTER SHOWERS.

16:42.833 --> 16:43.833
- OH, MAY WE HAVE--

16:43.833 --> 16:46.167
- BUP, BUP, BUP.

16:46.167 --> 16:48.300
SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION,
MRS. APPLEBY.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.767
MISS HATHAWAY,
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR

16:49.767 --> 16:52.800
THAT I WANTED THIS TO BE
AN ELEGANT, TASTEFUL AFFAIR.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.433
- TRUST ME, THIS TEA PARTY
WILL BE THE EPITOME OF ELEGANCE.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.233
ONE LITTLE SIDE NOTE:
THE VIOLINIST COULDN'T MAKE IT.

16:59.233 --> 17:01.133
HOWEVER...

17:01.133 --> 17:06.167
* ARE YOU GOING
TO SCARBOROUGH FAIR *

17:07.700 --> 17:09.467
APPARENTLY NOT.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.267
BACK IN A JIFF.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.100
THIS PLACE SO GIVES ME
THE CREEPS.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.400
- OH, WELL, NOW,
WHAT IS SCARING YOU THE MOST?

17:16.400 --> 17:20.300
IS IT THE SIX-YEAR-OLD
HOLDING THE BALLOON BOUQUET?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.967
- DO YOU JUST LIKE
TORTURING ME?

17:22.967 --> 17:27.433
- CLAY, UNTIL YOU REALIZE
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS GHOSTS,

17:27.433 --> 17:30.867
NO ONE IS EVER
GONNA BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

17:30.867 --> 17:32.600
- I CAN HELP YOU.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.200
GIRLS, REVERSE COURSE.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.800
NO SALE IS AS IMPORTANT
AS HELPING OTHERS.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.333
FRANKIE,
RELEASE THE HOUNDS.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.333
- YES!

17:40.333 --> 17:42.333
MOM, I WOULD SO HUG YOU
RIGHT NOW...

17:42.333 --> 17:43.167
- MM.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.267
- YOU KNOW, IF I WAS A HUGGER.

17:45.267 --> 17:47.067
TAYLOR, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.767
- LOCKED AND READY TO GO.

17:53.833 --> 17:57.067
- THEY'RE BACK.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.967
IT'S NOT HUMAN!

18:01.967 --> 18:05.967
- I REALLY DO NEED
TO SEE A DOCTOR.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.900
WHO'S CRAZY NOW, MOTHER?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.167
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

18:36.167 --> 18:38.967
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR JOB BACK.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.400
JUST GET ME OUT OF
THIS FREAK SHOW.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.500
- THANKS.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.133
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY
THAT MAKES ME.

18:52.733 --> 18:54.100
- BEFORE WE START,

18:54.100 --> 18:56.933
MR. PRESTON
HAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.767
AND THIS BETTER NOT BE
AN EXCUSE

18:58.767 --> 19:01.467
TO FART THE ALPHABET AGAIN.

19:04.233 --> 19:05.867
- HEH.

19:05.867 --> 19:07.733
GOOD MORNING, CLASS.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.467
SO THE OTHER DAY

19:09.467 --> 19:13.200
I TOLD YOU MY FATHER
WAS A SECRET AGENT.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.067
WELL, THE TRUTH IS--

19:16.067 --> 19:17.467
- THE TRUTH IS,

19:17.467 --> 19:20.733
I'M THE NUMBER ONE SECRET AGENT
IN GHOST WORLD.

19:24.267 --> 19:25.600
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.933
MAYBE GETTING READY
TO KICK SOME ALIEN BUTT!

19:27.933 --> 19:32.700
HIYAH, AH, AH, AH,
AH, AH, AH, AHH!

19:34.867 --> 19:38.600
- STUDENTS, WHEN I CAME
TO SPEAK TO YOU YESTERDAY,

19:38.600 --> 19:40.933
I WAS INTERRUPTED
BY A FIRE ALARM.

19:40.933 --> 19:43.733
I NOW KNOW WHO MAY BE
RESPONSIBLE

19:43.733 --> 19:45.267
FOR PULLING THAT ALARM:

19:45.267 --> 19:48.333
A GHOST-EATING SPACE ALIEN!

19:48.333 --> 19:50.667
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
AGENT PRESTON?

19:51.667 --> 19:52.867
I'M NOT SURE.

19:52.867 --> 19:55.433
HE'S AS RUTHLESS AS IT GETS.

19:55.433 --> 19:58.333
- RUTHLESS WITH A CAPITAL "R"!

20:01.567 --> 20:03.800
THEY CALL ME
THE GHOST GROOMER 3000

20:03.800 --> 20:05.700
'CAUSE I CLEAN AWAY THE SCUM.

20:08.700 --> 20:09.633
- SWEEP THE LEG!

20:09.633 --> 20:11.433
SWEEP THE LEG!

20:14.867 --> 20:15.900
STOP IT.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.533
STOP IT.
IT REALLY TICKLES.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.767
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
TAKE HIM DOWN, POPS.

20:19.767 --> 20:20.767
QUICKLY.

20:20.767 --> 20:22.033
- OKAY, YOU.

20:22.033 --> 20:24.467
IT'S TIME TO TAKE OUT
THE TRASH.

20:24.467 --> 20:26.100
JUDO CHOP!

20:26.100 --> 20:28.767
- OW, OW, OW!

20:30.933 --> 20:33.067
GOOD-BYE, PUNY EARTHLINGS.

20:33.067 --> 20:35.133
I REGRET NOTHING.

20:35.133 --> 20:38.600
STAY IN SCHOOL.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.433
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

20:46.433 --> 20:48.100
- SO COOL.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.967
- THAT'S MY DAD.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.000
- ALL RIGHT, I'M OFF
TO FIGHT MY NEXT BATTLE.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.033
BE SAFE.

20:57.033 --> 20:58.267
- POPS, WAIT!

20:58.267 --> 20:59.667
I STILL HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT

20:59.667 --> 21:01.067
I NEED TO MAKE.

21:01.067 --> 21:02.933
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT NOW,
SON.

21:02.933 --> 21:05.100
- YEAH, I DO.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.467
LISTEN UP.

21:06.467 --> 21:10.067
NOT ONLY IS MY POPS
A GREAT SECRET AGENT,

21:10.067 --> 21:12.400
HE'S ALSO
AN AWESOME MUSICIAN.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.533
HE CAN PLAY THE SAX
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS,

21:15.533 --> 21:19.867
AND I'M REALLY PROUD AND HAPPY
THAT HE'S MY DAD.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.233
- THANKS, LOUIE.

21:21.233 --> 21:23.067
- NO, THANK YOU, DAD,

21:23.067 --> 21:25.933
