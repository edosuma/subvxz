RUSTY (ON PA): Well, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain, Rusty Griswold.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.407
Hope you've enjoyed your 18-minute
flight from South Bend.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.882
RUSTY: We'll be touching down at Chicago's
Midway very shortly.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.441
We'd like to thank you for flying
with us today...

03:04.600 --> 03:08.366
because at Econo Air, we're working
hard to win back your trust.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.561
- Harry, you mind taking over while I hit the lav?
- Sure thing, Rusty.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.131
Thank you very much.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.570
- Oh, and Rusty.
- Mm-hm.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.964
I wanna thank you for going to bat
for me last week.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.360
I was happy to do it.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.842
You know, just because corporate says
you're too old to fly doesn't make it true.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.082
You're more qualified
than us younger guys.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.481
- Means a lot to me.
- Sure thing.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.240
- Oh, and Rusty.
- Mm-hm.

03:34.440 --> 03:39.082
I wanna thank you for going to bat
for me last week.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.645
Yeah.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.410
You bet.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.801
BOY: Dad, is that the pilot?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.086
It sure is.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.686
- He just came from the cockpit.
- Whoa.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.044
- Hey there, little guy.
- Hi.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.929
Is this your first time on a plane?

03:58.080 --> 03:59.445
We were planning on driving...

03:59.600 --> 04:02.843
but, uh, Tyler here has been begging us
to go on his first airplane.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.126
- Oh, is that right?
- TYLER: Uh-huh.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.011
Do you think I can be a pilot
when I grow up?

04:07.160 --> 04:09.003
Heh. Yeah, well, I don't see why not.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.721
You just have to study hard
and listen to your parents, all right?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.002
(PLANE RUMBLES, THEN ALL GASP)

04:15.920 --> 04:17.490
- Okay, heh.
- Sorry about that.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.449
- Little bit of rough air.
- It's okay.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.680
Yeah, yeah.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.365
Don't worry about it, heh.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.567
Hey, we call that "turbulence,"
all right?

04:25.720 --> 04:27.245
That's when the plane passes...

04:27.440 --> 04:29.363
(PLANE THUDDING, THEN ALL GASPING)

04:31.880 --> 04:33.291
(COUGHS)

04:33.800 --> 04:35.131
So sorry.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.806
Okay, you folks enjoy
the rest of your flight.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.487
Let me give you a hand.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.883
Can you please stay
the fuck away from us?

04:47.080 --> 04:48.809
(ALARMS WAILING)

04:50.960 --> 04:54.248
Harry, you took us up to 60,000 feet.
What are you doing?

04:54.400 --> 04:55.481
Oh, Rusty.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.440
I wanna thank you for going to bat
for me last week.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.001
Or the time that Pan Continental
put us up at the Ritz in Barcelona.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.891
You know, I'll tell you one thing
about the Spanish women:

05:20.040 --> 05:22.441
- They, uh, love them some airline pilots.
- Heh. They do.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.921
I never took the uniform off,
except when I did.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.929
(ALL CHUCKLING)

05:36.600 --> 05:37.726
Ladies.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.528
All full. You have to wait
for the next one.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.250
- But I was...
- You were what?

05:48.520 --> 05:49.885
I'll catch the next one.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.122
See you around, Econo Air.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.690
- JAMES: The third time this month.
- DEBBIE: I know.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.127
Do something about him.
He's always picking on me.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.284
I know he is. I'm so sorry, honey. Hey.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.608
- Hi. What's going on here?
- You'll see.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.967
Kevin, get down here, please.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.044
- Look what he did to my guitar.
- RUSTY: Aw. Again?

06:24.200 --> 06:26.567
God. You told Mom and Dad?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.085
You have such a vagina.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.089
Okay, enough, enough. Now, young man...

06:30.280 --> 06:32.760
we talked about the bullying
of your older brother.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.447
That's right. We don't make fun of
someone just because they're different.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.406
- I don't have a vagina.
- I'm just saying, if you did...

06:39.560 --> 06:42.564
it wouldn't be okay for Kevin
to tease you about your vagina.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.041
Why are you making it sound
like I have a vagina?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.931
I know you don't have a vagina.
I'm not doing that.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.766
- Kevin, apologize to your brother, please.
- Fine. I'm sorry.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.001
Now go to your room.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.646
Ah. I was in my fucking room.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.963
- Whoa, hey, Kevin? Get back down here.
- Ah.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.687
Now listen.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.047
There are a lot of boys who are born
with vaginas.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.486
It's very hard for them.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.644
- Honey. Why?
- It's a teachable moment, hon.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.644
Gender fluidity, right?
It's a very serious issue.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.326
- I'm not gender-fluid.
- It doesn't matter if you are.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.801
The point is
your mom and I would love you...

07:17.960 --> 07:20.167
even if you were completely blank
down there.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.243
DEBBIE: Okay, this is not the point.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.811
Kevin, just go to your room.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.360
Hey, James, don't get your
gender fluid on me.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.284
- Awesome.
- DEBBIE: Stop. It's not a fluid.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.090
And what about my guitar?

07:32.240 --> 07:33.730
It's ruined.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.525
Let me have a look.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.610
There you go. That'll do for now.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.525
Now get washed up. The Petersons
are coming over for dinner.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.641
Okay, baby.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.643
Oh, gosh.
I'll get you a new guitar, okay?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.963
- Oh, use the Vitamix. The dry bit.
- Just grind it. Yeah.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.726
Sheila.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.602
- So do you have to work tomorrow?
- JAMES: So, um, Sheila.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.570
- I want to go to the movies with my friends.
- Sheila.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.326
- What?
- Do you like school this year?

08:10.480 --> 08:11.527
It's okay.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.041
(IN LOW VOICE WITH LISP)
"So do you like school this year?"

08:14.200 --> 08:16.931
(IN NORMAL VOICE) That's seriously
what you sound like. Just shut up.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.522
God, I'm telling you, Russ,
you've gotta get one of these go-kart kits.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.727
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.406
Gary and I spent the last two months
building this.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.730
We took her out this morning
for the first time.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.848
Holy moly.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.722
- Fun?
- No, no, it was terrible. Yeah, it was fun.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.001
(BOTH LAUGHING)

08:37.240 --> 08:38.605
Hot damn, it's a go-kart.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.969
G-man, get over here.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.162
- G-man, G-man, G-man.
- Uh-oh.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.402
Oh, my God, my G-man. I love him.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.410
Get in there. What?

08:48.360 --> 08:50.283
What? What? Get in there. Get in there.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.482
(GIBBERING AND LAUGHING)

08:52.680 --> 08:55.126
Oh, man. I love you so much.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.206
Tell Mr. Griswold
how dope our go-kart is.

08:58.360 --> 09:02.365
It's got a Zanardi chassis and
a four-stroke Briggs & Stratton engine.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.723
- Wow, and you guys built this together?
- We worked on it every day...

09:05.880 --> 09:09.248
after homework and toothbrushing.
I love... Get over here, man.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.482
Work it, Sugar Ray. Come on, Sugar Ray.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.529
He's working me over.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.490
I'm gonna eat your face!

09:17.640 --> 09:19.005
Kevin, James, get over here.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.247
No.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.765
Come on, heh. Oh, there you are.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.650
(LAUGHING)

09:25.840 --> 09:28.684
- Dad, stop. What are you doing?
- Come on, man, we're sparring.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.611
- We do this all the time.
- No. We never do this.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.202
- Hey, don't hit your old man.
- I don't wanna be a part of this.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.645
What are you doing?!

09:39.800 --> 09:41.723
- This is how accidents happen.
- Sacrifice!

09:41.880 --> 09:44.770
Dad, let go of me. Stop.
Why did you do that?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.881
I'm sorry, man. Come on.
I was just fooling around.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.769
- That wasn't fun.
- Like we always do.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.331
JAMES: We never do that.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.324
Hey, what do you say
you and I build a go-kart together?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.206
If we have to.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.886
Yeah, all right, G-man, heh!

10:00.040 --> 10:02.281
Get out of here. Get out of here, G-man.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.925
(CHUCKLES)

10:04.160 --> 10:06.447
Did you just steal my son's nickname?

10:12.080 --> 10:14.447
I'm not sure about...
Oh, shoot. Dang it.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.082
Wow, your ring is getting loose,
there, Deb. Are you losing weight?

10:18.240 --> 10:20.322
Yeah. I am.
You know what I've been doing?

10:20.480 --> 10:21.527
Spinning.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.087
Yeah, it's a great stress reliever.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.925
I'm gonna tell you what's
an even greater stress reliever.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.889
And that is a week in Paris.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.486
Oh, my gosh! I saw that on Instagram.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.130
All your pictures were so great.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.560
- So you did see them.
- Yeah.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.008
Funny, because I was gonna ask
how come you didn't like any of them.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.844
What do you mean? I just said I did.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.970
All my other friends, uh, who saw my
Paris pics, they clicked "like."

10:43.160 --> 10:45.925
You were the only one who
didn't click "like."

10:46.120 --> 10:49.886
Oh. I guess I just didn't get around
to actually clicking "like" on them.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.765
Okay, because look at this one.
Now, in this one we have...

10:52.960 --> 10:55.167
- Sheila and Gary wearing berets.
- I know.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.051
- Right?
- Heh. I like that one so much. It's so cute.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.248
- But you didn't "like" it.
- Okay.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.562
Here are the four of us
at the Arc de Triomphe.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.560
Didn't "like" that. Didn't "like" my children.
Didn't "like" my man kissing on me.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.327
I promise you the second you guys leave
I am gonna go upstairs online...

11:10.520 --> 11:13.205
and I am gonna click "like"
on every single one of them.

11:13.400 --> 11:17.610
Honestly, honey, it really makes
no difference to me.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.690
So are you guys going anywhere
special this summer?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.842
No. I wish. Yeah. No.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.801
We are renting the same cabin that we've been
renting for 10 years in Cheboygan, Michigan.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.401
The boys call it "Che-boring," Michigan.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.970
- Isn't that funny?
- NANCY: Why don't you just go someplace else?

11:35.120 --> 11:39.489
No, we can't. Rusty loves it so much. I'd
break his heart if I told him we hate the cabin.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.211
- Oh, boy. I understand.
- Yeah.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.849
I understand.
Well, you know what the good news is?

11:46.040 --> 11:47.121
Hmm?

11:47.320 --> 11:51.211
Honestly, even if you go there and you
don't have a great time, baby...

11:51.360 --> 11:54.762
at least you know that I will click
"like" on all your photos.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.524
Jesus Christ, Nancy.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.887
MAN (ON TV): Look!

11:58.320 --> 11:59.526
Look!

11:59.880 --> 12:02.360
What the fuck is this?!

12:02.840 --> 12:03.887
Louie!

12:15.320 --> 12:17.049
What the fuck is this?! Hey, madam.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.841
How much capellini
are you throwing away?!

12:21.000 --> 12:25.210
What are you doing, Melinda?!
What are you doing?!

12:50.680 --> 12:52.284
(CHILDREN SCREAMING ON COMPUTER)

13:00.600 --> 13:02.125
Guys, I have exciting news.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.407
James has AIDS?

13:03.560 --> 13:05.528
What? No. That's horrible.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.882
- I'd be excited.
- Well, what is it? What is it?

13:08.040 --> 13:10.805
- The four of us are gonna take a little trip.
- Paris.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.962
Hmm. No, much better.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.249
We're driving to Walley World.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.522
- What?
- RUSTY: This family's in a rut.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.524
We gotta shake things up, right?
Spend a little quality time.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.809
It wouldn't hurt for the boys
to learn to get along a little better.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.361
- Uh, by locking them in a car together?
- Yeah.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.966
- This is some bullshit right here!
- Hey, language.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.164
Well, it is. I'm gonna miss the first
week of wrestling practice.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.402
We'll find a wrestling range
along the way, heh.

13:35.560 --> 13:36.971
That's not even a thing.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.283
And, Dad, no offense, I just don't
wanna do my first big road trip...

13:40.440 --> 13:42.363
to some corporate theme park, you know?

13:42.520 --> 13:48.209
I'd like to explore the real America,
like Jack Kerouac or the Merry Pranksters.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.522
- Don't say weird shit!
- Ah. Ow!

13:50.720 --> 13:52.324
Kevin, bullying! Guys, come on.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.723
My trip to Walley World when I was a kid
was the best time I ever had.

13:55.880 --> 13:59.930
So you just wanna redo your vacation
from 30 years ago?

14:00.080 --> 14:02.401
Don't you think that's gonna be
kind of a letdown?

14:02.560 --> 14:05.962
No, no, no. We're not redoing anything.
This will be completely different.

14:06.120 --> 14:10.444
For one thing, the original vacation
had a boy and a girl. This one has two boys.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.366
And I'm sure that there will be lots
of other differences.

will stand on its own, okay?

We can drive out and fly back.

follow me just then?

14:53.520 --> 14:57.206
- Oh, you wanted us to?
- Yeah, that's why I dangled the key like that.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.010

- Why else would I...?

14:59.160 --> 15:01.003

- That's a 2015 Tartan Prancer.
- Did you say "Tartan," honey?

Yeah. Tartan's the Honda of Albania.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.329

Why'd you get an Albanian car, Dad?

15:15.480 --> 15:17.687
Renting a family car
on Memorial Day weekend...

15:17.840 --> 15:21.765
doesn't leave you with a lot of options.
But this baby is pretty sweet.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.481
It's got all the latest Albanian technology.
Check it out. Plug-in hybrid.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.529
Oh, wow, eco-friendly. Good.

15:27.680 --> 15:32.641
So any time we run out of juice,
we can just pull right over, and plug in.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.689
I don't know what that is.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.888

it would retract. It just...

15:44.440 --> 15:48.286
I think you coil it. You just coil it like that.
Right? Then you close it right up.

Doesn't matter. Still got two gas tanks.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.887

- Carry twice as much gas.

15:53.040 --> 15:56.601
- Why not just have one big tank?
- It's twice the gas, buddy.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.603

the entire car from the fob.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.164
- JAMES: What do all the buttons mean?
- No clue. But we'll figure it out.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.561
Honey, is that a swastika on there?

16:23.720 --> 16:25.768
Yeah. We won't use that.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.566
This is my favorite part.

- Slam the door on my arm.
- Heh. What?

16:32.360 --> 16:35.887
It has a sensor. It won't let you
slam the door on your arm or leg.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.850
- I'm not doing that.
- The rental guy showed me. Just do it.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.365
- Okay.
- Do it!

16:41.760 --> 16:43.171
- Do it.
- This is kind of fun.

- I'm an idiot.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.562
- Do it again.
- No, absolutely not.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.087

- I won't do it.

- They hang out of your vagina.

- Plenty of time for that.

wouldn't have done any of those things.

not whether I did them or I didn't do them.

You stuck your finger in the dean's penis.

and what I burnt down. What is important...

38:25.400 --> 38:27.243
What's your story? You got a girlfriend?

38:27.400 --> 38:28.686
No.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.569
What? No girlfriend?

38:31.760 --> 38:34.047
Cute boy like that?
Somebody's gonna snatch you up.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.884
- Do you want me to call the cops?
- No.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.605
And he plays guitar?

38:37.760 --> 38:39.171
Dream boy.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.086
- Make a muscle.
- I'd...

38:41.240 --> 38:42.366
- Do it.
- JAMES: ...rather not.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.204
Take your shirt off. Make a muscle.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.169
- I really don't want to.
- Don't be shy.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.129
- Show us what you're working with.
- All right.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.965
Um, I should go.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.648
Are you sure that you'll be okay?

38:54.800 --> 38:56.040
I think so.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.611
Okay.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.646
Bye.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.287
Dang it.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.644
- Dad, why would you do that?
- Saw you talking to her.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.883
- Figured you could use a wingman.
- I didn't need a wingman.

39:10.040 --> 39:13.761
- Well, heh, looks like you did. She left.
- That's because you were approaching...

39:13.920 --> 39:15.968
You know, James, when I was your age...

39:16.160 --> 39:20.643
Grandpa Clark sat me down
and we had a little chat.

39:20.800 --> 39:25.044
Seeing you with that girl made me
realize that we haven't had that chat yet.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.690
- We don't need that chat.
- Yeah?

39:26.880 --> 39:30.248
Come on, I know it's embarrassing,
but it'd be a lot more embarrassing...

39:30.400 --> 39:33.244
if you found yourself tummy to tummy
with a lady friend...

39:33.400 --> 39:36.244
- and didn't know what goes where.
- I know what goes where.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.526
- You do?
- Uh-huh.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.966
- You sure?
- Yep.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.964
All right, all right.
Well, I just want you to know...

39:42.120 --> 39:46.170
I'm here to answer any questions
you might have about that stuff.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.840
No matter how uncomfortable it seems.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.405
Yeah, okay.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.609
- Yeah, right. Here it comes.
- Yeah. All right. Okay.

39:56.080 --> 40:00.688
Uh, there were some kids at school
who were talking about...

40:00.840 --> 40:01.921
rim jobs.

40:02.080 --> 40:05.323
- Hmm.
- So, what's that? What's a rim job?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.443
- Rim jobs.
- Yeah.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.161
- Is that R-I-M?
- Mm-hm.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.643
Rim job. Country of origin.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.207
I don't know. Um, America.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.010
Can I hear it in a sentence?

40:19.200 --> 40:21.248
- What's a rim job, Dad?
- Oh.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.042
Well, rim job.

40:25.400 --> 40:28.927
I would guess a rim job is when you
kiss someone with your mouth closed.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.731
Right? So you're only using
the rim of your mouth.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.891
- That's it?
- Sure.

40:34.040 --> 40:37.169
It felt like it was something
way dirtier.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.288
No, I mean, what else could it be?

40:40.120 --> 40:41.326
Any other questions?

40:41.480 --> 40:43.084
I guess not.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.645
Good talk, James.

40:46.080 --> 40:50.165
Now, I hope you're not too old
to let your dad give you...

40:50.320 --> 40:51.810
a good-night rim job.

42:06.600 --> 42:09.251
Looks like we might get to
Aunt Audrey's before dinner.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.004
Will Uncle Stone be there?

42:11.160 --> 42:13.242
Yeah, I suppose he will.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.563
- Uncle Stone is cool.
- You have to be cool to be a celebrity.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.009
Heh. He's not exactly a celebrity.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.208
I mean, he's a local weatherman.
That's all.

42:21.360 --> 42:24.204
Uh, actually, Audrey said that
the networks are interested in him.

42:24.360 --> 42:25.407
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

42:25.600 --> 42:26.965
All right. Well, good for him.

42:27.120 --> 42:30.488
- Think Uncle Stone will let me ride his horse?
- I don't see why not.

42:30.640 --> 42:33.007
- Do you think I can shoot his guns?
- No, you cannot.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.281
Too bad. I would've shot you
right off that fucking horse.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.603
I never would've imagined my sister
marrying such a conservative.

42:42.760 --> 42:46.287
Yeah, but just because Stone's
political beliefs are different than ours...

42:46.440 --> 42:48.727
doesn't mean he's not good-looking. I...

42:48.920 --> 42:50.649
A good person.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.689
(CHUCKLES)

42:52.920 --> 42:54.331
- You said it.
- Uh, honey...

42:54.480 --> 42:55.527
Hey, look at that!

42:55.680 --> 42:58.490
Hot springs up ahead.
We've always wanted to do that.

42:58.680 --> 43:00.762
Oh, honey,
we don't wanna be late to Audrey's.

43:00.920 --> 43:03.082
So we're a few minutes late.

43:03.240 --> 43:07.040
We're on vacation. Right? Come on.
Let's have some fun.

43:07.760 --> 43:08.807
Okay.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.808
- Oh. Look at the line.
- This will take forever.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.282
Come on, guys. How often do we get
to soak in hot water?

43:22.440 --> 43:23.930
Every time we take a bath.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.528
No, this is different, okay?
This is natural.

43:26.680 --> 43:29.160
This water was heated
in Mother Nature's bowels.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.651
Oh. Gross.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.088
There's gotta be another way in.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.725
I'm gonna ask this gentleman.
I bet he'd know.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.365
Excuse me, sir.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.851
- Hi there.
- Hey. Hi.

43:40.040 --> 43:44.170
Hey, we were wondering. Is there
another entrance to the hot springs?

43:44.320 --> 43:46.561
Like a secret entrance the locals use?

43:46.720 --> 43:50.884
- Line can get pretty long this time of year, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, it sure can.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.451
Yeah, I'll tell you what you'll do.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.683
Uh, can you see that dirt road?
That path there on the left?

43:55.840 --> 43:58.446
- Yeah.
- If you just follow that all the way up...

43:58.600 --> 44:00.443
that'll take you to the hot springs.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.489
All right, perfect. Thank you.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.610
Oh, no, no. You bet.
Y'all have a good time.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.728
- Oh, will do, heh.
- MAN: Heh.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.490
Hey, what's your pet rat's name?

44:09.640 --> 44:11.324
Is my pet what?

44:11.800 --> 44:14.246
What the fuck? What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

44:14.400 --> 44:15.447
(RAT SQUEAKING)

44:15.600 --> 44:16.761
I don't know him.

44:27.480 --> 44:31.166
Honey, are you sure about this?
I mean, nobody else is going this way.

44:31.680 --> 44:35.810
Yeah, well, most people think
inside the box.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.681
But you know who thinks outside the box?

44:38.840 --> 44:40.683
Uncle Stone?

44:40.840 --> 44:43.491
Me. Your father.

44:47.920 --> 44:51.242
Um, honey, I don't see any hot springs.

44:51.400 --> 44:54.324
Well, the guy said it was
right at the end of this road, so...

44:54.480 --> 44:58.690
Well, the guy also did not know he had
a rat on his shoulder, so there's that.

44:58.880 --> 44:59.927
Hold on.

45:08.800 --> 45:11.280
Wow, honey, this is beautiful.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.886
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.605
All right, everyone.

45:16.760 --> 45:19.240
In your bathing suits. Now! Heh.

45:20.680 --> 45:24.366
Looks like we found our
own private hot spring.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.602
- I say we call it "Griswold Springs."
- Heh.

45:29.640 --> 45:32.371
- The water's perfect.
- Oh, my God. It's so nice.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.284
Why does it smell like rotten eggs?

45:34.440 --> 45:36.920
- That's the sulfur, buddy. It's natural.
- Yeah.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.162
Yeah. And it's really good for you too.

45:39.320 --> 45:42.051
Actually, the minerals that are
in this mud here...

45:42.200 --> 45:44.123
they draw toxins out of your body.

45:44.760 --> 45:45.807
Can you believe that?

45:45.960 --> 45:47.121
Cool, right?

45:51.200 --> 45:52.247
Oh, wow.

45:53.120 --> 45:56.567
Mm. This is perfect.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.644
It's exactly what we needed.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.041
Oh, yeah. Good call, Griswold.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.882
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

46:06.040 --> 46:08.281
- Oh, yeah. That's it.
- That's it. That's it.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.966
I can feel my body detoxifying.

46:16.160 --> 46:17.207
You know...

46:18.320 --> 46:21.767
it tastes a little shitty, but I think
that's part of it. That's okay.

46:21.960 --> 46:23.485
This is wonderful.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.682
That is the stuff.

46:31.680 --> 46:32.761
What is that, honey?

46:32.920 --> 46:34.843
On your ear. What's on your ear?

46:35.160 --> 46:36.241
What is that?

46:37.840 --> 46:38.966
It's an ear!

46:39.400 --> 46:40.447
(SCREAMING)

46:41.120 --> 46:43.009
Look, James. Found a dart.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.565
Are you crazy?

46:44.720 --> 46:47.326
Oh, my God!
Everybody out of Griswold Springs!

46:47.480 --> 46:49.448
- JAMES: Get out of the poop!
- KEVIN: That was nasty!

46:50.640 --> 46:51.687
All over me!

46:52.280 --> 46:54.089
I don't like Griswold Springs.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.287
(ALARM BEEPING)

46:55.440 --> 46:56.487
Is that our car alarm?

46:58.560 --> 46:59.721
What?

47:00.320 --> 47:04.689
Ugh. How come that local guy didn't tell us
there are thieves in these woods?

47:05.880 --> 47:06.927
Oh, right.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.407
JAMES: He took my guitar.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.449
Oh, my God. He took all our money, Russ.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.369
All right, not a best-case scenario.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.851
But, hey.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.604
He left your book.

47:16.760 --> 47:20.128
So, I guess we get the last laugh.

47:20.280 --> 47:21.327
Oh, really, honey?

47:21.520 --> 47:23.727
We're naked and covered in human waste.

47:23.880 --> 47:26.884
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
We don't know that it's human.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.370
(MAN READING ON-SCREEN TEXT IN KOREAN)

47:34.320 --> 47:37.290
This is so embarrassing.
I feel like your cousin Eddie's family.

47:37.440 --> 47:41.081
It's no big deal. We'll just tell
Stone and Audrey what happened.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.810
Kids, remember what happened?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.401
We pulled over to rescue a baby
from a burning car...

47:45.560 --> 47:48.564
and somebody stole all of our stuff
while we were distracted.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.331
And why are we naked
and covered in feces?

47:51.480 --> 47:53.005
I don't remember.

47:53.160 --> 47:55.481
That's right. We don't remember.

48:14.040 --> 48:15.565
Oh, my God.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.569
Oh, come on.

48:21.520 --> 48:24.490
- What're we gonna do?
- Can you give me a hand with this? Please?

48:24.640 --> 48:27.246
Just... Yeah.

48:27.400 --> 48:28.925
Oh, gosh.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.526
- I can't. I can't get it off.
- Just use your spit.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.846
Oh, okay.

48:34.440 --> 48:35.601
RUSTY: Focus on the balls.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.922
If you guys wanna stop,
that'd be good too.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.167
RUSTY:
Stay on the balls. I've got the shaft.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.201
AUDREY: Hi, y'all!

48:44.960 --> 48:46.644
Hey. Oh, my goodness. Hi.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.165
What happened?

48:48.800 --> 48:50.086
Well, that's a...

48:50.280 --> 48:52.009
It's a crazy story...

48:52.160 --> 48:53.889
Dad got scammed by a guy at a park.

48:54.040 --> 48:56.247
- Kevin.
- Same old Rusty.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.890
You'd buy water from a faucet.

48:58.120 --> 48:59.406
(ALL CHUCKLING)

49:02.000 --> 49:04.128
Anyway, you guys look disgusting.

49:04.280 --> 49:06.681
I have some clothes
I was gonna give to the church...

49:06.880 --> 49:08.928
if you guys wanna borrow some of those.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.570
- Great. Thank you, Audrey.
- Yeah.

49:10.760 --> 49:12.728
- Come on inside.
- All right.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.609
Boy, y'all stink.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.129
Oh, I don't like that.

49:21.080 --> 49:24.323
Man, this place makes our house
look like shit.

49:24.520 --> 49:29.845
Well, Kevin, that's only because a dollar goes
much further out here than it does in Chicago.

49:30.480 --> 49:33.131
Especially when you make a
lot more of them, heh.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.440
Just messing with you.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.683
Shoot, you boys are growing faster
than a weed under a faucet.

49:38.840 --> 49:41.605
- You still rassling, son?
- Uh-huh.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.484
Uh-huh. Oh, come on.
Show me what you got.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.249
(BOTH GRUNTING)

49:47.440 --> 49:51.331
- Hey, Kevin. Get off your brother, please.
- They're just having themselves a rassle.

49:51.480 --> 49:54.529
- It's what brothers do.
- DEBBIE: Hey, oh, look at you guys.

49:54.720 --> 49:58.167
Hot damn. Debbie Griswold.
You just keep getting prettier.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.482
- Oh, stop.
- STONE: No, I mean it.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.890
You could make hot water
come out of the cold faucet.

50:05.880 --> 50:07.530
Oh, heh. That's very sweet.

50:07.680 --> 50:10.286
You know, I remember the night
you first wore that dress.

- You remember that night?
- I remember that night.

- Neither will I, baby.

to you tonight.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.165
DEBBIE: Is this Charlton Heston?

50:43.320 --> 50:45.322
Yep, Chuck was a good friend.

50:45.520 --> 50:48.729
I can't tell you how many nights
we spent drinking bourbon together...

50:48.880 --> 50:50.848
crying about the state of this country.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.606
It's true, they did.
They literally cried together.

50:53.760 --> 50:56.843
Hmm. Somehow I don't see you
crying, though, Stone.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.525
Yeah, that's, uh...

50:58.680 --> 51:00.489
That's kind of embarrassing, right?

51:01.280 --> 51:02.930
Not embarrassing to me.

51:03.120 --> 51:06.169
Even the strongest faucet
sometimes lets out a few drops, heh.

51:06.320 --> 51:08.561
What is with these faucets?

51:08.720 --> 51:10.404
STONE:
Everyone thought that F-4 twister...

51:10.560 --> 51:13.006
- was gonna bypass Harris County.
- AUDREY: Not my Stone.

51:13.160 --> 51:17.882
I had a feeling that that low-pressure system
was gonna make a beeline for Mission Bend.

51:18.520 --> 51:22.605
Thanks to my report, those people had
an extra 15 minutes to evacuate.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.168
- Ah.
- Governor Perry said he saved 2000 lives.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.130
That's how many we lost
at Pearl Harbor...

51:29.280 --> 51:32.489
so basically he stopped Pearl Harbor.

51:32.640 --> 51:35.371
That's when the national news called.
Now, between us...

51:35.520 --> 51:36.726
it's looking good. Ain't it, honey?

51:36.920 --> 51:38.285
(LAUGHS)

51:38.880 --> 51:42.521
Course none of that would've been
possible without my sugar mama here...

51:42.680 --> 51:45.524
working day and night to put me
through meteorology school.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.809
I liked working, baby.
I didn't mind it one bit.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.082
Well, you never have
to do it again, darling.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.890
But it kind of gave me purpose.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.849
Nope, never again. That is a promise.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.326
(LAUGHS)

51:56.520 --> 51:59.046
Wow, Uncle Stone, I may not agree
with your politics...

51:59.200 --> 52:02.249
- but that doesn't mean I don't admire you.
- STONE: Well, thank you.

52:02.400 --> 52:06.291
But the man you should admire the most
is sitting right next to you.

52:06.840 --> 52:08.524
But there's nobody there.

52:08.680 --> 52:11.160
Oh, I don't mean that chair.
I mean your pa right here.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.560
Okay, heh.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.768
- He doesn't save anybody's life.
- STONE: Doesn't he?

52:15.520 --> 52:19.525
Well, every time he flies that little plane
of his, he's saving lives by not crashing.

52:19.680 --> 52:20.806
And in my book...

52:21.360 --> 52:22.646
that makes him a hero.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.761
Thank you.
You know, a lot of people actually...

52:25.920 --> 52:30.323
Not to mention, he also snagged himself
one sweet slice of foxy pie in your mama there.

52:30.480 --> 52:33.484
You gotta stop that today. Stop it.

52:34.440 --> 52:37.046
You know what I always wanted
to know was...

52:37.640 --> 52:40.803
when did you first know the weather?

52:42.160 --> 52:43.207
You all right, Deb?

52:43.400 --> 52:45.323
- What?
- Hey, there's a cow.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.601
(MOOS)

52:46.800 --> 52:48.564
Oh, not a cow. That's a steer.

52:48.720 --> 52:52.770
That there is $6000 worth of juicy,
purebred Angus beef.

52:52.960 --> 52:54.007
(CHUCKLES)

52:54.200 --> 52:57.443
It's Stone's new passion, raising cattle.
He's even named them.

52:57.640 --> 53:01.087
Uh-huh. Old Sebastian here
loves him some ribs.

53:01.280 --> 53:02.441
Here you go, boy.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.762
Yeah. Oh, that's it.

53:07.160 --> 53:10.130
- Dad, isn't that...?
- Cannibalism? Yeah.

53:10.280 --> 53:14.126
You boys get up early tomorrow, you can
watch me herd these suckers into the corral.

53:14.320 --> 53:16.163
- Oh!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

53:16.320 --> 53:17.731
You herd them yourself?

53:17.920 --> 53:19.490
Heh, I'm a man, aren't I?

53:19.640 --> 53:21.051
Yes.

53:22.240 --> 53:25.687
Uh, hey, Stone, not sure if you need
a hand out there, but I'd love to help.

53:25.840 --> 53:29.128
Sure thing. If you're up for it
I can always use an extra set of hands.

53:29.280 --> 53:32.762
Well, I was born
with an extra set of hands.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.523
That's an odd thing to say, heh.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.447
But I reckon this'll be
the highlight of your trip.

53:38.600 --> 53:42.207
Well, the real highlight, of course,
will be when we get to Walley World...

53:42.400 --> 53:46.405
and I take my family
on the Velociraptor.

53:46.560 --> 53:50.246
I think it is so weird. I don't know why
you want to go back to Walley World...

53:50.400 --> 53:51.845
after Dad flipped out there.

53:52.040 --> 53:56.170
Audrey, Dad flipped out because
he loved us and wanted us to be close.

53:56.320 --> 53:59.130
And we were.
And that's all I want for my family.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.560
(LAUGHS)

54:00.760 --> 54:02.444
You're such a clown.

54:02.600 --> 54:03.965
RUSTY: You're a clown.

54:04.120 --> 54:05.929
Babe, baby, I think Rusty's right.

54:06.080 --> 54:10.483
You know, family is the most
important thing there is.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.489
Little something...

54:12.720 --> 54:13.926
(DEBBIE LAUGHS)

54:15.480 --> 54:17.721
Maybe we'll take baby Cooper
on a trip this summer.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.166
Yeah, not to Walley World.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.010
- Oh, God, no.
- Because that'd be stupid.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.367
That'd be stupid. How about Paris?

54:23.520 --> 54:24.567
(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

54:26.400 --> 54:29.210
And then we get back
I can maybe get a part-time job?

54:29.360 --> 54:32.284
Well, not while there's breath
in my body, sweetheart.

54:32.480 --> 54:33.766
(LAUGHS)

54:37.120 --> 54:39.691
You know, honey, I am really happy
for your sister.

54:39.880 --> 54:40.927
- Yeah?
- Seriously.

54:41.080 --> 54:43.924
She and Stone seem really in love.
It's nice.

54:44.080 --> 54:47.084
These pants Stone gave me are really
stretched out in the crotch.

54:47.240 --> 54:49.402
Weird. Why would they be
stretched out in the...?

54:49.560 --> 54:51.210
- God, I don't know.
- Holy shit.

54:51.360 --> 54:53.647
How much you think they paid
for this house?

54:54.960 --> 54:58.442
Whoa. Oh, okay, whoa.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.762
Oh, should I see if Audrey has
a Yankee Candle?

55:00.920 --> 55:03.571
Fuck the Yankee Candle.
I wanna do this now.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.963
- Oh, God, you're so sexy. Oh, my God.
- Oh, what has gotten into you?

55:09.240 --> 55:10.446
What? What, what?

55:11.360 --> 55:12.885
This is because of him, isn't it?

55:13.080 --> 55:14.411
What? Who?

55:15.240 --> 55:16.810
Because of who?

55:17.000 --> 55:18.331
Because of Stone.

55:18.480 --> 55:20.801
- What?
- That's why you're jumping my bones.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.048
- You're thinking of him.
- That's ridiculous.

55:23.200 --> 55:25.248
Then how come the one night
we're with him...

55:25.400 --> 55:29.883
- you turn into some kind of sexual character?
- I don't know where you're going with this...

55:30.040 --> 55:32.407
- Where's your wedding ring?
- Oh, my God.

55:32.560 --> 55:34.927
Before we got here, you took off
your wedding ring?

55:35.080 --> 55:37.048
No, I didn't, Rusty. It was loose.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.645
You remember how loose it was?

55:38.800 --> 55:40.882
And I must've just dropped it somewhere.

55:41.040 --> 55:44.089
What was the plan? Show up
with no ring, he'll think you're single?

55:44.240 --> 55:46.891
How will he think I'm single
if I'm here with my husband?

55:47.040 --> 55:48.724
I don't know. It was your plan.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.962
It was not my pl... Okay.

55:52.240 --> 55:57.371
Yes, Stone is an impressive man, okay?

55:57.560 --> 55:59.449
But I married you, Rusty.

55:59.600 --> 56:01.841
And I am so sorry that I lost my ring...

56:02.040 --> 56:05.931
but I would never, ever, ever
take it off on purpose.

56:08.640 --> 56:10.961
I know, I know. I just...

56:13.240 --> 56:15.766
I freaked out. I'm sorry. I just...

56:17.080 --> 56:18.320
We'll get you another ring.

56:18.520 --> 56:20.170
I liked that one.

56:21.320 --> 56:22.446
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

56:22.640 --> 56:24.324
Hey, y'all decent?

56:24.520 --> 56:25.931
- Yes. Hi.
- Hey.

56:26.080 --> 56:29.846
Okay. Just wanted to make sure y'all
had everything you needed for the night.

56:30.560 --> 56:31.686
Yep.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.806
All right.

56:34.560 --> 56:37.769
Man, it sure is beautiful here
this time of year, ain't it?

56:38.800 --> 56:41.121
And quiet. Listen.

56:41.800 --> 56:43.211
You hear that?

56:45.400 --> 56:47.801
- No.
- Exactly. It's perfect silence.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.240
Hmm.

56:50.080 --> 56:52.082
Yeah, yeah.

56:52.240 --> 56:56.165
Well, uh, TV remote.
Okay, let me show you.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.448
I've got, uh, channels...

56:58.640 --> 57:00.051
and the volume.

57:00.200 --> 57:01.565
On. Off.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.003
- Pretty straightforward.
- Yeah.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.367
- Yeah.
- Great.

57:06.520 --> 57:07.567
All right.

57:07.720 --> 57:11.520
Well, uh, if you get thirsty,
there's fresh milk in the fridge...

57:11.680 --> 57:14.684
and have yourselves a good night.

57:14.840 --> 57:16.968
- DEBBIE: Uh-huh.
- Okay.

57:17.160 --> 57:19.322
- Night, Stone.
- Good night, Stone.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.166
Man.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.251
Yeah.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.521
Okay.

57:31.280 --> 57:34.250
He totally just came in here
to show off his six-pack.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.691
Hey, morning.

57:39.880 --> 57:41.882
Ugh, barely.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.769
How come you gotta do this at 6 a.m.?

57:43.920 --> 57:46.127
Well, I gotta be
at the station by 7:30...

57:46.280 --> 57:48.931
for Stone Crandall's AccuWeather Report.

57:49.760 --> 57:51.603
Hey, you ever ride one of these things?

57:52.600 --> 57:54.011
No, never have.

57:54.160 --> 57:58.882
But, uh, can't imagine it's more
complicated than an Airbus A318.

57:59.040 --> 58:01.566
Heh, yeah, well, that's the spirit.

58:01.720 --> 58:05.042
Now, the key here is to move
back and forth along the edge of the herd.

58:05.200 --> 58:08.329
You keep your distance, though.
You don't want to spook them.

58:08.480 --> 58:10.130
Got it.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.645
Okay.

58:12.720 --> 58:13.801
Are there helmets?

58:14.360 --> 58:16.442
Yeah, I keep them with the tampons.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.445
Just basic safety.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.285

58:27.480 --> 58:30.211
It's my favorite way to start the day.

58:30.720 --> 58:32.449
This, and making love to your sister.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.320
Thank you for that.

58:39.160 --> 58:40.491
STONE: Come on, let's go!

58:41.320 --> 58:43.527
It looks like we got us
a couple of mavericks.

58:43.680 --> 58:46.524
You take the one on the left.
I'll take the one on the right.

58:46.680 --> 58:48.523
Unless you need my help with yours.

58:48.680 --> 58:50.125
No, I think I got it.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.328
Last one to the corral's
a rotten cowpoke.

58:52.760 --> 58:54.000

59:03.800 --> 59:04.847
Whoa!

59:12.240 --> 59:13.526
Hey!

59:14.920 --> 59:16.160
Holy shit!

59:16.400 --> 59:17.686
(SCREAMS)

59:17.880 --> 59:18.961
Oh, my gosh!

59:26.160 --> 59:27.810
Is the cow okay?

59:28.000 --> 59:31.083
No, the cow's not okay, Russ.
You drove plumb through him.

59:31.240 --> 59:32.810
Oh, no, Sebastian.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.611
Gross.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.846
Hey, gang, uh...

59:52.520 --> 59:54.921
Maybe for lunch we could find
a burger place.

59:55.200 --> 59:56.964
You know, like a, uh...

59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.246
Like a drive-through burger place.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.487
(CHUCKLES)

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.527
I don't know, Dad.
I think we should, uh...

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.921
steer clear of that.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.726
- Good one, James.
- All right, enough, you guys.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.327
Dad hit a cow, okay? Let's just move on.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.760
(ALL LAUGH)

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.968
- Oh, I got one.
- Yeah? Let's hear it.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.442
James is a piece of shit.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.682
You kind of missed
the point there, buddy.

And it's gonna sound crazy,
but hear me out, okay?

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.930
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.007
We're right near
the Four Corners Monument...

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.084
which is where four states
come together in one spot.

- So?
- Let's go have sex on it.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.521
What? Heh.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.486
Yeah, that way we can make love in
four states at the same time.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.721
Wait.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.730
You're serious?

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.489
Yeah. I mean, you're the one who
said we should mix it up.

would do it.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.962
Okay, well, Debbie Do-Anything
was a dumbass.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.168
Maybe that's what we need.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.402
To be dumbasses together.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.050
What about the kids?

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.450
Well, Kevin's kind of a dumbass.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.766
No, no, honey.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.002
What are we gonna do about them?

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.442
They're fine. They're fast asleep.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.967
We'll be back
before they know we're gone.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.886
- Okay.
- Yeah?

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.610
All right, let's do it.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.206
Mom?

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.287
Dad?

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.724
- James?
- Mom?

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.563
- Adena?
- Are you, like, stalking me or something?

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.802
No. What? No.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.689
I'm kidding.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.921
- Relax, heh.
- Oh!

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.565
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.402
Hey, what happened with that perv
who was hitting on you in Arkansas?

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.369
That was actually my dad.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.402
He was trying to be my wingman.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.801
Oh, my God.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.961
He's a really shitty wingman.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.441
So no guitar tonight?

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.810
It got stolen.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.930
That sucks.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.689
I really liked hearing you play.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.167
You did?

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.971
Yeah, I've always had
a thing for musicians.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.768
Well, good...

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.890
because I've always had a thing for...

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.005
pretty girls.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.205
Well played.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.727
See? You don't need a wingman.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.685
Here it is.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.804
Oh, my God. This is so illegal.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.770
- I know, it's so hot, right?
- Yeah.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.365
I am hard as a faucet right now.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.840
(CHUCKLES)

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.930
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh. No. I like it.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.127
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.327
- Yeah?
- I do.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.921
- You like it when I slap that ass?
- I do, I do, heh.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.368
- Good. I'm gonna beat the shit out of your ass.
- Whoa, Russ.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.409
Okay, right here?

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.565
(MOANING)

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.485
- We're about to have sex outside.
- I know. Heh, I know.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.211
- Do you want me to put a finger in?
- In what?

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.486
- Never mind.
- Okay, okay.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.371
Y'all wanna keep it down?

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.126
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Hey, watch it, man!

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.760
- Get your leg off me!
- You're so slippery and sweaty!

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.003
If you're here to have sex on the Corners,
we're next. Get in line.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.685
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, God.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.047
(BOTH GASPING)

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.690
Oh, God!

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.209
Oh, God! They're in every state!

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.771
So many boobies out here!

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.410
MAN 1: You two! Freeze!

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.766
MAN 2: Go, go, go!

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.967
MAN 1: Hands up!

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.963
- WOMAN: Run! Honey, run!
- MAN 3: Get your shoe!

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.441
MAN 1: Drop the flashlight!

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.525
You do know public indecency
is a crime in the state of Utah?

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.727
Yes. Sorry, officer.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:01.009
- See, we're married, and we wanted to just...
- Save it for the judge.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.404
It makes me sick how you deviants show up
and desecrate this holy place every night.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.006
- Turn around. Hands behind your back.
- What?

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.810
KYLE: Not so fast, Tommy.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.440
Shoot for sherbet.
What are you doing here, Kyle?

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.207
These people are clearly in the state
of Colorado. That's my jurisdiction.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.169
WOMAN: Juris-dick in my ass, Kyle.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.045
Look at her left foot.
Smack-dab in Arizona.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.090
You weed-legalizing,
Mile-High piece of shit.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.289
- Hey, there's no reason for that language.
- Sorry, Officer Mormon.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.925
You don't like that? I have an idea.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.487
Why don't you plug up your ears
with Mitt Romney's dick?

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.886
- Ha, ha.
- Hey.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:36.368
Oh, looks like New Mexico decided
to wake up from his siesta.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.524
- What's the trouble?
- Tell you what the trouble is, dreamcatcher.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.081
You are wearing entirely too much
goddamn turquoise.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.605
Hey, we can do this without...

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.287
- disrespecting each other's traditions.
- Oh, go fuck your wives, Tommy.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.886
This is what I'm telling you.
Every night we do this.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.931
You know what this border represents?
It's just an idea. That's all I'm saying.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.846
- If it's just an idea, then I'll just get the perp...
- Ah! My house!

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.286
- Hey!
- Stay out of my state.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.171
- What are you gonna do now?
- Get your feet off of my state!

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.651
You wanna stomp on my foot?!

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.370
- You back...
- Is that what you want?

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.005
Hey, I wasn't even in it!

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.686
Don't you kick in here! Don't start...

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.046
How about this, then, huh?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.328
- We got a live weapon!
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.926
- Think I'm afraid of that?
- I'm not afraid of you.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.560
- How about that, huh?
- Oh, yeah, like I'm afraid?

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.205
(GRUNTING)

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.205
- Are we...? I don't want it in my mouth.
- Let's not do that.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.409
- I'll take that all in, dude.
- That's enough! Everyone get down!

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.962
- Get down on the ground! Get down!
- Get down! Get down on the ground!

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.566
I'm cooperating!
I'm the one who's cooperating!

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.570
- You get down too. You get down too.
- Get down on the ground!

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.125
- Hands where?
- Your right side.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.691
- Sides or front?
- Side to side.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.285
- Let's do this.
- Everyone down?

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.681
- Okay.
- I think I'm done.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.887
(ALL PANTING)

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.091
You can really see
all the stars out here.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.121
Yeah.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.484
So, what do you feel like doing?

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.206
Heh. I don't know.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.682
Can I give you a rim job?

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.969
- Whoa.
- No.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.280
- What?
- I don't know.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.920
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.770
What did you wanna do?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.288
I don't know.
I thought maybe we could...

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.601
kiss or something?

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.808
Well, yeah, that's what I thought I...

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.803
Yeah. Okay.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.126
Ow.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.089
Where's Mom and Dad, dork?

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.282
I don't know.
Just go back inside the thing.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.442
You were about to let
that dingus kiss you?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.250
Shut up, Kevin.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.051
- Who is that?
- My stupid little brother.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.567
I thought you said
he was your big brother.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.882
- I... Damn it!
- Dingus.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:56.089
- Why do you take that from him?
- Am I supposed to hit him back?

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.083
- He's a little kid.
- He's a little shit.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:03.087
- You don't have to let him push you around.
- I kind of thought I was taking the high road.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.608
Yeah, that seems
to be working out for you.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.960
You know what?

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.570
Fuck it.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.487
Okay, so you wanna do this now?

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.563
Bring it, bitch.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:22.447
Wait, what?

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.805
No, no, no.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.161
Wow, this is so easy.
You are such a little boy.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.524
Unh! There's gonna be a few changes,
all right? No more bullying.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.046
- Stop it. I'm telling Mom.
- Shut your mouth.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.361
You gonna stop bullying?

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.090
You're hurting my tummy.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.527
Say you're gonna stop,
you little piece of...

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.728
- ass.
- Wait, what?

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.769
- "Piece of ass"?
- You know what I mean.

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.488
What are you doing to my face?

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.045
- This hurts, doesn't it?
- Dude.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.647
- How do you like your ears getting messed up?
- It's really not that bad.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.883
- I'll tap you on the forehead.
- That's not how you beat someone up.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.564
Very dehumanizing.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.563
Your forehead's gonna be so sore.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.609
Stop it! What are you doing?!

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.207
- How do you like your lips getting tickled?
- This is really weird.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:07.089
JAMES: Just smush your cheeks.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.131
- You gonna stop bullying?
- Fine, I'll stop bullying. Just stop doing this.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.645
Thank you, Adena.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.086
This has been...

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:18.124
the best night of my life.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.809
Weird fucking family.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.564
Well, that was awful.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.808
At least the kids never woke up.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.930
RUSTY: Passengers on the left side
of the Prancer will notice...

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.327
the Grand Canyon out the window.

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:52.609
That's right.
Last stop before Walley World.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.767
So, guys...

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.083
when we visited the Grand Canyon
when I was a kid...

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.322
we barely had a chance to look at it.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.244
This time...

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.801
we're gonna do a whole lot more
than look.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.881
- JAMES: Oh, cool.
- DEBBIE: Sweet.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.127
(CHUCKLES)

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.089
Hi, folks! Hi!

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.203
All right, let's see,
who do we got here?

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.771
You must be...

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.570
the Fung family.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.921
Huh?

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.122
I'm just messing!
You're the Griswolds, right?

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.566
Yes, that's right.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.611
Heh, right. The little guy's face
was like, "Fungs?"

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.881
Anyway, I'm Chad.
I'm gonna be your guide.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.771
- Okay. Hi, Chad.
- You couldn't have come on a better day.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.160
I'll get you all geared up.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.482
And, guess what, the river's
running way high...

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.206
so I think we're in for
a pretty sweet ride, guys.

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.885
- Let's roll.
- All right.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.610
Let's do this.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.770
CHAD: Okay, gang, joke time is over.
Let's get serious for a second.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.651
Go over a couple safety procedures
before we hit the water.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.930
First off, do any of you know this river?
Because this is actually my first time.

of coming back alive.

I'm getting a call from my fiancée here.

Just got engaged two weeks ago,
so I think I'm gonna take this...

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.729
or the river's not gonna be the only
hot water I'm in today.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.845

America's greatest aquatic treasures.

- Kevin, don't hit your brother.
- I didn't.

You heard what he said
about the "aquatic treasures," right?

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.087
- Yeah.
- And you didn't wanna hit him?

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.044
- Well, that's progress.
- Wow.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.124
I don't understand, though.
Like, what are you even saying?

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.249
But just like that?

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.767
I love you. You love me.

think about this for a second, honey.

You're all that I have in this world.
Tanya, no, babe.

really care about Walley World.

we almost died back there.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.641
I mean, isn't it time that we just
cut our losses?

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.049
KEVIN: This really hurts.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.124
Then the muffin made the car explode,
but it didn't matter.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.846
Our luggage and all of our stuff
was already stolen...

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.083
- by the guy with the rat on his shoulder.
- Even took my guitar.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.049
Oh, James, that's terrible.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.806
A musician without his instrument is
as bad as...

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.843
a shoemaker without a toilet seat.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.883
Ah, I may have something for you.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.325
It's very fragile. Look.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.761
- You take care of that.
- Wow, Grandpa.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.524
Thank you so much.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.170
- Cool.
- Yeah.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.364
Doesn't look like much,
but that's a very special guitar.

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.410
- It was given to me by Bob Dillon.
- The Bob Dylan?

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.891
No, a Bob Dillon.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.088
D-I-L-L-O-N.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.884
- An accountant friend of mine.
- Oh.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.447
But it was given to him
by Jimmy Hendricks.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.807
- The Jimi Hendrix?
- No.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:09.203
So how's the B-and-B business going?

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:12.648
Oh, we love it, are you kidding?
It's a great fit for us. We love visitors.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.810
We love having people around
to care for. We're people people.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:19.328
- Hey, guys. You mind if we join you?
- We're occupied right now. Beat it.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.931
Ah, it's getting late. Go to bed, okay?

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.730
- Okay.
- Yeah. I'll run you upstairs.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.601
- Good night, Grandma and Grandpa. Thank you.
- ELLEN: Nighty-night. Sleep tight.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.485
Ah, well, you've certainly
had an adventure.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.007
Well, yes. "Adventure"
is one way to put it.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.401
(CHUCKLES)

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.443
- How's Audrey?
- Oh, she's great.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.491
Yeah, she and Stone, they seem
to be very happy.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.051
Key word there is "seem."

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.204
- What do you mean?
- Their marriage is a sham.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.647
- What?
- Well, they sleep around on each other.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.167
- Been doing it for years.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:58.611
I just wish Audrey had found a more
solid marriage like you and Rusty.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.202
Hey, Russ, can we talk?

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.203
I knew we had some problems.
Is it this bad?

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.767
Is our marriage dying?

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.206
No.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.331
No, a marriage only dies
when you stop trying.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.801
And you have never stopped trying.

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.210
I just think...

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.850
maybe I did.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.407
What do you mean?

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.402
I've only been thinking about
myself, you know?

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.609
I wanted to change the routine,
and go on exotic trips and...

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.167
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.049
I was crazy to think I could make us
closer by locking us in a car for a week.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.168
No, but you were doing that for us.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.770
You have been trying so hard to make
this trip memorable for me and the kids...

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.491
- and I didn't appreciate that.
- But why would you?

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.803
I mean, I've put you through
some serious shit.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.611
Literally, a pool of shit in Arkansas.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.211
(CHUCKLES)

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.523
You deserve better.

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.562
What, better than you?

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.323
How many men would sacrifice their
careers for their family like you have?

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.927
Oh, I didn't sacrifice anything.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.567
I have everything I've ever wanted.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.128
- Debbie.
- Yeah?

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.210
Will you continue to be my wife?

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.328
I wondered when you'd
give that back to me.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.642
I was wondering if you still wanted it.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.961
I do.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.007
Wait a minute.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.286
Are we gonna do this?

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.807
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna
pound the shit out of you.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.121
- Russ.
- What?

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.725
Lock the door.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.724
I'm gonna lock
the shit out of that door.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.480
- Hey, Dad.
- Morning, Rusty.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:17.850
Could you drive us to the airport this afternoon?
There's a flight back to Chicago at 4.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.411
Chicago?

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.289
What about Walley World?

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.808
Oh, no. We've, uh, had enough.

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.760
- This trip's been a nightmare.
- Well, that's what family vacations are.

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:31.321
- But you can't give up, Russ.
- Well, why not?

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:36.520
I mean, they always say "it's not
the destination, it's the journey," right?

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.920
The journey sucks.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.651
That's what makes you appreciate
the destination.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.207
You had a dream to take your family
to Walley World.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.488
Never let that go.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.165
I know I didn't.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.250
How would we even get to
Walley World? We don't have a car.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.845
MAN: Hey, come on.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.045
You leave that to me.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.931
(LAUGHING)

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.804
Oops, wrong door.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.882
Could I, uh, take the Nissan?

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.611
Ha, ha. No, no.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.481
Wait, Dad, I thought we were going
to the airport.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.371
Boys, when your father makes you
a promise, he keeps it.

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.568
- That's not right.
- This sucks.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:14.002
- Wow, this place is huge.
- Ha, ha.

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.844
This is dope as fuck.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.161
BOTH (IN UNISON): Kevin.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.922
Told you you guys would love it, right?

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.646
Hey, Dad.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.651
- It really is dope as fuck.
- I know, right?

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.961
- Guys!
- Oh, wait!

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.571
There she is.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.370
The Velociraptor.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.810
- I can't believe we actually made it.
- Heh, I know.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.761
- You guys ready for the ride of your life?
- Oh, yeah.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.247
If I'm being honest,
it looks a little daunting.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.926
- Come on. Race you to the ride.
- Yeah, go, go! Faster!

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.320
Come on!

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.922
Two more hours, guys.

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.608
Oh, my gosh.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.240
- All right, guys. Get psyched.
- Yes.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.846
This is it.
This is why we came all this way.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.890
Excuse us.

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.971
- What was that?
- Last ride tonight. Park's closing.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.531
- No, we were next.
- What?

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.721
- That's not okay.
- Should be a misunderstanding.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.525
Hey, excuse me.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.404
You just cut in front of us.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:40.129
No, see, we bought the Platinum Pass
so we get to skip the lines.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.691
Fifth time today on this one.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.721
Right, well, we just drove 2500 miles
to ride this ride...

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.969
so you can't just take our spot.

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.045
Wait a minute, you...

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.526
Econo Air.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.841
Yeah?

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.886
Good to see you.
All right, I'll tell you what.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.567
Why don't you and your family
go fuck yourselves?

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.001
I'm sorry, guys.

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.681
Oh, my God!

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.366
Okay.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.042
- Get off!
- Oh, it's on.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.247
Kevin, no!

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.291
No, you're not gonna fight.

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.205
- I'm not gonna stand here like a little bitch.
- What?

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.801
Oh, shit.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.964
No, Kevin. Kevin, no. Kevin, come on.

01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:19.642
You people are fucking crazy.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.690
- What kind of a family are you?
- We're the Griswolds.

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.365
See you around...

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.363
you piece of ass.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.211
- Let's do this.
- All right.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.046
- I haven't been in a fight like that for years.
- First car, all right.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.207
Man, our family fucked that family up.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.125
- We did.
- Did you see how I scratched that girl's arm?

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.806
Oh, I saw it, honey.
You gave her a good scratch.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.247
My fingers still hurt a little,
but I'll be okay.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.447
Oh, boy. Here we go.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.642
- Hold on.
- Oh, gosh!

Is it supposed to stay
upside-down like this?

Yeah, I don't think so.

Oh.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.690
Looks that way, pal.

Listen, boys, I can't tell you how much it's
meant to me to spend all this time with you.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.488
I love you more
than anything in the world.

every single day with you.
