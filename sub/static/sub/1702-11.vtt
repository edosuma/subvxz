00:02.168 --> 00:04.795
Okay, pick a card, any card.

00:04.963 --> 00:07.548
All right, now memorize it.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.009
Show it to everybody.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.218
- Got it?
Mm-hm.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.470
All right. Give it back to me.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.977
Five of hearts.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.771
- Real magic does exist.
- Oh, wow.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.315
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?

00:25.483 --> 00:26.942
I can't tell you that. No.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.781
Uh, somebody's at the door
on the ceiling.

00:32.949 --> 00:36.702
Heh. No, that's our unbelievably loud
upstairs neighbor.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.538
He took up the carpets,
and now you can hear everything.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.208
Well, why don't you go up there
and ask him to just step lightly, please?

00:44.252 --> 00:47.254
I have, like five times,
but the guy is so charming...

00:47.422 --> 00:50.382
...that I go up there to yell,
and I end up apologizing to him.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.510
Oh, that is silly.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.846
I'll go up there.
I'll tell him to keep it down.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.931
- All right, be my guest.
- Good luck.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.600
All right, all right, all right.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.186
If you really wanna know how I did it,
I'll show you.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.731
When you handed me back the card,
what you didn't see was...

01:05.899 --> 01:09.068
...I looked at it so fast,
it was invisible to the naked eye.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.238
I just did it.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.990
Just did it again.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.661
Here, I'll slow it down
so you guys can see it. Ready?

01:21.623 --> 01:25.167
- Oh.
- I got it now. Okay.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.966
I was at my friend's downstairs...

01:33.134 --> 01:35.260
...and we hear every single thing
that you do.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.852
Oh. Ha, ha. Thank you.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.946
Hey.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.242
Anybody got a length of rope
about 6 feet long with a noose at the end?

02:40.451 --> 02:42.369
- Honey, what's the matter?
- I just saw Janice.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.662
Aw.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.582
She was at Rockefeller Center,
skating with her husband.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.959
She looked so happy.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.713
I almost feel bad
for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.217
I remember the first time
I saw that girl Katherine after we broke up.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.387
She was walking with her friend Donna,
just laughing and talking.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.014
God, it killed me.

03:02.807 --> 03:06.476
Yes, but you ended up having sex
with both of them that afternoon.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.606
Sorry, I just...
Any excuse to tell that story.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.195
Hey, Chandler, there's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.865
Oh. You know what? I'm gonna be okay.
You don't have to throw a party for me.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.201
It's Joey's birthday.

03:22.869 --> 03:26.163
Oh, well, then if anybody
should have a party, it should be him.

03:28.499 --> 03:31.210
Shh. I cannot believe she's still up there.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.764
Okay, well,
he totally screwed up the punch line.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.098
You know, it's supposed to be:

03:53.399 --> 03:56.944
- How's that coffee coming, dear?
- Yeah. Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.655
I'm not supposed to drink coffee.
It makes me gassy.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.158
I know.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.870
I'll bet you're thinking,
"What's an intelligent girl...

04:07.038 --> 04:09.748
...who wants to be in fashion
doing making coffee?"

04:09.916 --> 04:13.418
- Ah? Ah? Ha, ha.
- Oh, ha, ha. You got me. Heh.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.754
Don't think I haven't noticed
your potential.

04:15.922 --> 04:20.175
Well, I've got a project for you
that's a lot more related to fashion.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.928
- How does that sound?
- Oh. That sounds great.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.265
- Come on over here, sweetheart.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Kaplan.

04:26.432 --> 04:30.811
I need these hangers separated ASAP.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.314
You're welcome.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.737
Oh, God, I hate my job.
I hate it. I hate my job.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.572
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.118
Oh. I wanna quit,
but then I think I should stick it out.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.577
Then I think...

04:47.745 --> 04:50.872
...why would such a person stay
in such a demeaning job...

04:51.040 --> 04:55.585
...just because it's remotely related
to the field they're interested in?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.922
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

04:59.090 --> 05:02.926
Order up. I got a Yentl soup, James Beans,
and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.762
Oh. Honey, come on, I'm sorry. I didn't...

05:05.930 --> 05:07.306
I don't mind paying my dues.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.891
It's just, how much am I gonna learn
about fashion...

05:10.059 --> 05:12.644
...by walking Myra,
the arthritic seamstress...

05:12.812 --> 05:14.354
...to the bathroom?

05:16.691 --> 05:19.735
Hi. Is my misery amusing to you?

05:19.902 --> 05:22.779
I'm sorry, I was just, uh... Ha, ha.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.073
It's not funny. This is actually my job.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.783
Oh, believe me, I've been there.

05:26.951 --> 05:30.329
I had to sort mannequin heads
at Mannequins Plus.

05:30.496 --> 05:34.875
Oh. Well, then, so I'm just gonna go back
to talking to my friend here.

05:35.043 --> 05:38.086
You can go back
to enjoying your little hamburger.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.758
- Uh, just one other thing.
- Ahem. Yes?

05:42.925 --> 05:44.509
I work at Bloomingdale's...

05:44.677 --> 05:47.929
...and I might know of a job possibility,
if you're interested.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.267
Do you want my pickle?

05:59.525 --> 06:00.609
Hey, guys.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.902
- Hey, Gunther.
- Hi.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.696
You're going out on a date
with the noisy guy upstairs?

06:04.864 --> 06:08.367
- Well, he's very charming.
- I know, he's too charming.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.953
But if you go out, it's gonna make it
so much harder for me to hate him.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.956
Well, you're just going to have to try.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.126
All right. Joey?
Where are the Jell-O shots?

06:18.294 --> 06:21.296
I don't know.
Chandler's supposed to be passing them...

06:22.131 --> 06:25.509
- Chandler.
- Hello-dee-lo.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.261
Well, somebody's feeling better.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.765
- Stick out your tongue.
- Take off your shirt.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.396
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my God.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.190
How many of these did you have?
These are pure vodka.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.943
Yeah, Jell-O just like Mom used to make.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.364
The most unbelievable thing
happened to me today.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.698
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.910
I'm having lunch at Monica's
and this guy starts talking to me...

06:52.078 --> 06:54.246
...and he works for a buyer
at Bloomingdale's...

06:54.414 --> 06:57.749
...and there's an opening in his department.
So I gave him my phone number...

06:57.917 --> 07:00.919
...and he's gonna call me this weekend
to see if he can get me an interview.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.255
- Wow. Ha, ha.
- I know.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.757
What, so this guy's helping you
for no apparent reason?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.259
Uh-huh.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.595
And he's a total stranger?

07:10.763 --> 07:14.015
Yeah. His name is, um, Mark something.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.894
Ah. Sounds like Mark Something
wants to have some sex.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.939
What?

07:21.107 --> 07:25.110
I'm just saying, why else would he just
swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?

07:25.820 --> 07:27.070
To be nice?

07:27.238 --> 07:31.074
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice
to strange women for no reason?

07:31.325 --> 07:32.742
- No, only for sex.
- Thank you.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.040
So did you tell Mark Something
about me?

07:39.876 --> 07:43.503
I didn't have to, because I was wearing
my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board...

07:43.671 --> 07:44.838
...and ringing my bell.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.381
Ah. Uh-huh.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.802
Joey! Happy birthday!

07:50.970 --> 07:52.762
Hey!

07:54.640 --> 07:57.726
Okay, how many of that girl
are you seeing?

08:00.521 --> 08:03.190
How hammered are you? Huh?
These are Joey's sisters.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.816
Hi, Joey's sisters.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.526
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.236
What are we drinking over here?

08:08.404 --> 08:11.615
Oh, well, I have a vodka
and cranberry juice.

08:11.782 --> 08:12.866
No kidding?

08:13.034 --> 08:16.745
That's the exact same drink I made myself
right after I shot my husband.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.040
Wow.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.584
Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.004
What are you doing?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.798
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend
off my speed dialer.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.175
Aw.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.427
No, no, no, it's a good thing.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.597
Why must we dial so speedily anyway?
Why must we rush through life?

08:36.765 --> 08:41.269
Why can't we savor the precious moments?
Those are some huge breasts you have.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.855
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:44.023 --> 08:49.194
Yeah, heh. So, um, I heard about
this Mark guy that Rachel met today.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.113
- Oh, yeah, isn't that great?
- Oh, yeah.

08:52.281 --> 08:55.158
So, uh, yeah, pretty good.
He sounds like a nice, good guy.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.495
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.456
I mean, you know what?
When he left, I actually used the phrase...

09:01.624 --> 09:03.625
..."homina, homina, homina."

09:05.711 --> 09:07.546
That's excellent.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.552
So he's just a nice guy.

09:14.178 --> 09:17.973
You really think this Mark doesn't want
anything in exchange for helping you?

09:18.140 --> 09:21.017
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers
with him.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.978
But, you know, that's true of any job.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.066
Uh-oh.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.276
How you feeling?

09:29.443 --> 09:31.570
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore...

09:31.737 --> 09:34.114
...because I drank it.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.744
Where'd you get to? We lost you
after you opened up all the presents.

09:39.954 --> 09:44.332
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room,
and not alone.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.542
Woo-hoo.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.751
- Really?
- Aah.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.546
No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."

09:50.548 --> 09:51.631
Why, what happened?

09:54.802 --> 09:56.720
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.600
- Well, that's not the worst part.
- What is the worst part?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.810
I can't remember which sister.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.689
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.566
This is men.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.487
Are you insane?

10:14.655 --> 10:17.616
Joey's gonna kill you.
He's actually going to kill you dead.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.909
Okay. You don't think I thought of that?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.705
- How can you not know which one?
- I mean, that's unbelievable.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.874
- I mean, was it Gina?
- Which one is Gina?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.209
The dark, big hair,
with the airplane earrings.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.420
No, no, no, that's not Gina, that's Dina.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.673
See? You can't tell
which is which either. Blah.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.845
We didn't fool around with any of them.
Blah. Blah.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.809
Veronica. Look, it's gotta be Veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.354
I definitely stuck my tongue
down her throat.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.523
That was me.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.404
Oh. When I've been drinking,
sometimes I tend to get overly friendly.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.239
- And I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.867
- That's all right.
- That's okay.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.665
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:08.209 --> 11:10.418
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.505
Come on.

11:14.256 --> 11:18.259
Why can't we talk in here,
with witnesses?

11:18.427 --> 11:21.721
- I just got off the phone with my sister.
- Uh, which one?

11:21.889 --> 11:23.390
- Mary Angela.
- Mary Angela.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.643
- Yeah.
- Now, which one is she again?

11:26.811 --> 11:29.312
Ask Chandler.
He's the one who fooled around with her.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.024
She told me you said
you could really fall for her.

11:33.192 --> 11:37.278
Now, is that true, or are you just
getting over Janice by groping my sister?

11:40.324 --> 11:42.450
It's gotta be the first one.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.619
Really?

11:44.787 --> 11:46.579
That's great.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.375
You and my sister, sitting in a tree.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.670
Yep, I'm in a tree.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.383
Did he call? Did Mark call?

11:58.551 --> 12:00.844
No, honey, I'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.100
Oh, my God. Is that Phoebe?

12:07.268 --> 12:09.519
- Guess they're back from their date.
- Ah.

12:11.439 --> 12:15.650
Music. Very nice.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.320
Uh-huh. Oh.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.951
Oh, my God.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.414
So how are you?

12:30.166 --> 12:33.585
- I am good. I finished my book.
- Oh, yeah? What's it about?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.712
I don't remember.
Do you wanna take a walk?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.380
Yeah, I do.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.135
"Dear Mary Angela:

12:42.303 --> 12:44.012
Hi, how's it going?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.639
This is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write."

12:46.807 --> 12:50.351
What the hell's the matter with you?
How do you think Joey's gonna react...

12:50.519 --> 12:53.229
...when he finds out
you blew off his sister with a letter?

12:53.397 --> 12:56.691
That's the part where you tell him
that I moved to France...

12:56.859 --> 12:58.985
...when actually I'll be in Cuba.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.030
All right, look, look,
you've got to do this yourself, okay?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.365
In person. At least you know her name.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.243
You just go to the house
and you ask for Mary Angela, okay?

13:07.411 --> 13:09.537
When whichever one she is
comes to the door...

13:09.705 --> 13:11.831
...take her for a walk,
you let her down easy.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.082
Okay.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.878
What if Mary Angela comes to the door
and I ask for Mary Angela?

13:17.671 --> 13:19.672
Where in Cuba?

13:30.893 --> 13:34.229
Joey, what...? What are you doing here?

13:34.396 --> 13:36.439
Waiting for my grandma
to finish my laundry.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.732
What about you?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.860
Uh, I'm here to see Mary Angela.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.447
You are so the man. Come on.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.034
Now, look, listen. Listen.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.204
You gotta be cool, because my grandma
doesn't know about you two.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.914
You do not wanna tick her off.

13:53.082 --> 13:57.377
She was, like, the sixth person
to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.045
Yeah.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.296
Where's Mary Angela?

14:01.382 --> 14:03.842
- She's right in there.
- Okay.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.054
Hey, Chandler.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.687
I can't believe Mark didn't call.
It's Sunday night and he didn't call.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.897
Bummer.

14:18.065 --> 14:21.484
Yeah, right. Look at you.
You're practically giddy.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.195
No, I'm genuinely sorry
the Mark thing didn't work out.

14:24.363 --> 14:28.616
Look, Rach,
I want only good things for you.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.119
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?

14:33.789 --> 14:36.124
Who says you have to sit here
and wait for him?

14:36.292 --> 14:38.001
You've got to make stuff happen.

14:38.168 --> 14:41.796
Yeah, but you don't
wanna seem too pushy.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.340
Honey, it's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.

14:44.508 --> 14:48.094
Wha...? He gave you his home number,
as in, like, to his home?

14:48.262 --> 14:52.140
Yeah. And you don't mind if I call,
because you only want good things for me.

14:52.308 --> 14:56.144
That's right, good things.
That is what I said.

14:58.689 --> 15:03.109
Ahem. Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green.

15:04.987 --> 15:09.365
Ha, ha. Oh, no. Don't you apologize.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.617
Yeah, I'll hold.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.577
He left my number at work.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.289
He was gonna get it, but he was helping
his niece with her report on the pioneers.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.959
- Aw.
- That is so made up.

15:20.127 --> 15:24.297
Yeah. Oh, my God. Tomorrow?
That's... No, it's perfect.

15:24.465 --> 15:28.384
Oh, God. Thank you so much.
Great. Bye.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.011
Oh! I got the interview.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.930
- Oh, yay!
- There you go.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.224
He even offered to meet me for lunch
and prep me for it.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.143
- Oh, that is amazing.
- Yeah.

15:37.311 --> 15:40.605
Well, if I know Mark, and I think I do...

15:41.482 --> 15:44.734
...I'd expect nothing less.
- I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear.

15:44.902 --> 15:48.321
High collar and baggy pants say,
"I'm a pro."

15:49.031 --> 15:51.449
Yeah, right. Okay, I'll see you guys later.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.659
- Woo-hoo!
- Okay.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.911
You go get them.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.164
What did I do to you?
Did I hurt you in some way?

15:58.999 --> 16:02.335
- What?
- "Why don't you call him?"

16:02.503 --> 16:04.837
Well, thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her.

16:05.005 --> 16:10.218
You know, prep her, as in what you do
before you surgically remove the boyfriend.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.636
Are you crazy?

16:11.845 --> 16:15.264
Oh, am I? Am I? Am I out of my mind?
Am I losing my senses?

16:17.101 --> 16:20.311
This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend
out for a meal.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.522
Ross, you know, this isn't even about you.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.441
This is about Rachel
and something happening for her.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.360
- Uh-huh.
- Even if you're right.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.697
What if he wants to sleep with her?
Does that mean he gets to?

16:30.864 --> 16:32.824
- No, but...
- I mean, don't you trust her?

16:33.033 --> 16:34.242
Well, yeah...

16:34.410 --> 16:36.953
Then get over yourself. Grow up.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.251
You grow up.

16:54.388 --> 16:57.682
This tiramisu is excellent.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.144
- Did you make it, Mary Angela?
- No, I did.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.063
Well, it's yummy.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.943
So, uh, Mary Angela, do you like it?

17:09.111 --> 17:11.362
Of course. It's her favorite.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.407
So, um, hmm...

17:15.576 --> 17:18.368
Mary Angela,
what's your second favorite?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.163
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

17:20.329 --> 17:23.124
Oh, would you just please...

17:24.585 --> 17:26.711
...give me your recipe,
because this is great.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.588
It's top-notch.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.883
- That dies with me.
- So will I.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.720
Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.514
Oh, no, I was just squinting.
That doesn't mean anything.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.224
Just do it.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.149
Will you excuse me? I have to, um...

17:59.495 --> 18:00.953
Hey...

18:01.330 --> 18:03.539
Finally. I thought we'd never be alone.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.999
Can I just tell you something?

18:05.167 --> 18:07.752
I have not stopped thinking about you
since the party.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.046
Mm. Mm.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.966
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.
Whoa.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.802
Uh... Ahem.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.804
I just got out of a relationship.

18:17.971 --> 18:21.933
And I'm not really in a...
In a commitment kind of place.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.184
So? Me neither.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.687
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.397
Aah.

18:28.565 --> 18:32.318
- You're not Mary Angela?
- No. I'm Mary Therese.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.821
This is so bad.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.824
If you're not Mary Angela, then who is?

18:38.033 --> 18:39.742
I am.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.995
Oh, it's so bad.

18:43.163 --> 18:46.833
- Joey!
- No Joey. No Joey. No Joey.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.168
- Joey.
- What's going on?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.338
You're it. Now run and hide.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.674
It's no big deal.

18:54.842 --> 18:58.386
Chandler was just kissing me
because he thought I was Mary Angela.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.722
What? How could you do that?
How could you think she was Mary Angela?

19:01.890 --> 19:04.851
I wasn't sure
which one Mary Angela was.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.728
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

19:07.896 --> 19:10.982
I was really drunk,
and you guys all look really similar.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.233
I say punch him, Joey.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.068
- Yeah, punch him.
- Yeah, kick him.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.528
We should all calm down...

19:15.696 --> 19:18.906
...because, you know,
your brother's not gonna punch me.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.992
Are you?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.952
Well, that is usually what I would do.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.496
But I never thought
you'd be on the receiving end.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.331
How could you do this?

19:27.499 --> 19:29.876
Joey, if you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.

19:30.043 --> 19:34.422
But I just want you to know that I would
never soberly hurt you or your family.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.507
You're my best friend.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.427
And I would never do anything
like this ever again.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.430
So what?

19:42.598 --> 19:45.516
- I say punch him. Punch him.
- Yeah, punch him.

19:45.726 --> 19:49.353
- Come on, punch him.
- No. No. I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.814
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.026
Look, he knows he did a terrible thing,
and I believe him.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.904
He's sorry.
But you got one more apology to make.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.740
All right?
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.784
- Okay. Absolutely. You got it.
- All right.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.463
- Cookie, now you can punch him.
- What?

20:23.931 --> 20:24.972
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.265
What are you doing here?

20:26.433 --> 20:29.185
You know,
this building's on my paper route, so...

20:29.394 --> 20:31.020
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.230
How did it go?

20:32.397 --> 20:35.066
Oh, well, the woman I interviewed with
was pretty tough...

20:35.234 --> 20:37.235
...but, you know,
thank God Mark coached me.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.446
Once I started talking about the fall line,
she got all happy.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.491
- I'm so proud of you.
- Me too.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.576
Listen, I'm, uh...

20:46.745 --> 20:51.082
I'm sorry I've been so crazy
and jealous and...

20:51.250 --> 20:53.584
It's just, I like you a lot, so...

20:53.752 --> 20:54.794
I know.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.003
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.213
- Rachel.
- Yeah?

20:57.381 --> 20:58.631
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Mark.

20:58.799 --> 21:02.134
I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you.
You got it. You got the job.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.678
- What?
- Oh! I did?

21:03.845 --> 21:04.929
Yes.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.305
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

21:06.473 --> 21:09.016
- Congratulations...
- Oh! Wow.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.523
- So, Phoebe.
- Hmm?

21:15.691 --> 21:16.816
How was your date?

21:16.984 --> 21:19.026
Oh, well, you know. Ha, ha.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.654
Yeah, I do know.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.239
Ick. You were eavesdropping?

21:23.407 --> 21:27.285
Eavesdropping?
Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.496
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:30.664 --> 21:35.960
But I really like this guy,
and I think he really happens to like me.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.169
- Aw.
- Yay.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.845
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo stick
and he really likes it.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.600
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.188
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe.

21:56.356 --> 21:59.608
This guy's gonna get the butt-kicking
of a lifetime.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.278
But is he a big guy?

22:02.446 --> 22:03.571
We'll all go. Come on.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.449
- Thanks, you guys. Thank you.
- Don't worry.

22:06.616 --> 22:10.161
God. I hope they kick his ass.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.829
Honey, I'm sorry.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.664
You know, if it's any consolation...

22:13.832 --> 22:16.667
...he really did sound
like he was having more fun with you.
