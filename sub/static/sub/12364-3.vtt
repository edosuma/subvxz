SHE WAS SICK.
IT LOOKED LIKE THE FLU.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.419
BUT INSTEAD OF TAKING
HER TEMPERATURE,

11:12.631 --> 11:14.587
THIS DOCTOR TOOK OFF HER PANTS
AND GAVE HER A PELVIC EXAM.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.424
DID DR. MALLORY TELL YOU
WHY HE DID THAT?

11:17.636 --> 11:19.342
OH, HE SAID HE WAS JUST
BEING THOROUGH,

11:19.555 --> 11:20.635
BUT HE ABUSED
HIS MEDICAL AUTHORITY

11:20.806 --> 11:21.886
TO LOOK UP
MY DAUGHTER'S SKIRT.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.464
SO, YEAH, I RAISED MY VOICE.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.174
ARE YOU HERE TO PRESS CHARGES
AGAINST ME?

11:25.352 --> 11:28.094
NOT YET. WE WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.599
IF SHE WAS MOLESTED,
A REPORT SHOULD BE FILED.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.189
SHE'S AT A FRIEND'S
HOUSE TONIGHT.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.732
AND FRANKLY,
THERE'S NO NEED

11:33.944 --> 11:35.434
FOR YOU TO DRAG OUT
THIS ORDEAL.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.394
THE SITUATION HAS BEEN
DEALT WITH.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.108
VIC: "THE SITUATION
HAS BEEN DEALT WITH"?

11:42.327 --> 11:44.443
IS THAT A NICE WAY OF SAYING
HE MURDERED THE GUY?

11:44.663 --> 11:46.028
CHECK DR. MALLORY'S
BACKGROUND

11:46.248 --> 11:47.988
FOR REPORTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE
BY PATIENTS.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.288
IN THE MEANTIME,

11:49.501 --> 11:50.581
WE NEED TO TALK
TO DALE'S DAUGHTER.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.204
GET HER SIDE
OF THE STORY.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.332
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS,
SEE IF I CAN TRACK HER DOWN.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.539
NO NEED. I KNOW WHERE
SHE'S GONNA BE TOMORROW.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.339
HOW SO?

11:58.552 --> 12:00.588
I RECOGNIZED HER
FROM THE PICTURES INSIDE.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.420
SHE'S A CONTESTANT IN THE
MISS CHEYENNE NATION PAGEANT.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.598
I WAS SORT OF SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU IN THE COURTROOM.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.677
BACK IN SCHOOL, I NEVER
PEGGED YOU AS A LITIGATOR.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.933
SO, HOW'D I DO?
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

12:12.149 --> 12:14.731
I THINK THAT WAS
YOUR FIRST BAIL HEARING.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.683
[CHUCKLES]
[CHUCKLES]

12:16.904 --> 12:18.235
I'M NOT REALLY
A TRIAL LAWYER,

12:18.447 --> 12:20.563
BUT THERE'S A LOT RIDING
ON THIS CASE FOR ME.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.071
YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF THESE
BAIL HEARINGS, THOUGH, RIGHT?

12:25.287 --> 12:27.653
SO, ASIDE FROM
THE CLIENT'S RECORD,

12:27.915 --> 12:29.576
WHAT ELSE COULD I USE AS PROOF
TO SHOW THAT HE WON'T RUN?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.908
IS THIS WHY YOU CALLED ME?
TO PICK MY BRAIN?

12:33.128 --> 12:36.040
YOU NEVER MINDED TUTORING ME
IN LAW SCHOOL.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.541
RIGHT...

12:37.758 --> 12:39.749
BUT I HAD
OTHER INTENTIONS.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.386
SO, HOW ABOUT [CHUCKLING]
I BUY YOU DINNER TONIGHT

12:44.598 --> 12:46.964
AND YOU GIVE ME
YOUR EXPERTISE?

12:47.184 --> 12:48.549
SAVE YOUR FLIRTING
FOR THE JUDGE.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.975
WHAT QUESTIONS YOU GOT?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.302
OKAY, ARE THERE ANY LAWS
THAT I SHOULD REFERENCE

12:52.522 --> 12:53.432
IN THE BAIL HEARING?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.893
OR IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT I COULD, LIKE...?
CADY...

12:56.109 --> 12:57.565
BAIL HEARINGS
ARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.393
IF YOU WANT THE JUDGE
TO GRANT BAIL,

12:59.613 --> 13:00.523
YOU NEED TO PROVE TO HIM

13:00.697 --> 13:02.483
THAT YOUR CLIENT
IS AN HONORABLE PERSON.

13:02.658 --> 13:03.522
RIGHT.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.357
BRING OUT HIS FAMILY --

13:05.577 --> 13:06.566
PREFERABLY DAUGHTERS.

13:06.787 --> 13:07.697
THE JUDGE HAS THREE GIRLS.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.279
HENRY DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FAMILY.

13:11.041 --> 13:11.905
THAT'S BAD.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.915
SO YOU GOTTA SPIN
SOME BULLSHIT

13:14.169 --> 13:15.875
ABOUT HOW HENRY'S GOT TIES
TO THE COMMUNITY.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.123
HE DOES.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.499
THERE'S A WHOLE GROUP
OF PEOPLE

13:18.715 --> 13:19.921
ON THE RESERVATION
THAT DEPEND ON HIM.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.998
I COULD BRING THEM
ALL IN TO TESTIFY.

13:22.261 --> 13:24.047
[CHUCKLING ] WHOA.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.503
JUDGE MAYHEW HATES
A LONG HEARING.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.431
FIND ONE GOOD WITNESS
AND PUT THEM ON THE STAND.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.847
BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE
EVEN THAT'LL HELP.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.554
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT
YOU CAN GUARANTEE WILL HELP?

13:35.816 --> 13:38.808
YEAH.
PROVE HENRY DIDN'T DO IT.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.821
THAT WAS THE HOSPITAL.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.236
THE CALL THAT LURED
BEN MALLORY TO THE BARN

13:47.411 --> 13:48.742
CAME THROUGH
THE SWITCHBOARD.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.531
SO THE CALL
IS UNTRACEABLE?

13:50.789 --> 13:51.574
RIGHT.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.497
THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL
IF IT'S DALE GREY WOLF

13:54.710 --> 13:56.166
OR SOMEONE ELSE ENTIRELY.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.834
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

13:58.046 --> 14:00.378
MAYBE DR. MALLORY WASN'T
AT THE BARN ON BUSINESS.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.875
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL,

14:02.092 --> 14:03.502
THE ONLY REASON ANYBODY
WENT UP THERE

14:03.719 --> 14:05.459
WAS TO HOOK UP
WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.503
SO INSTEAD OF MAKING
A HOUSE CALL,

14:07.806 --> 14:09.137
HE WAS MAKING
A BOOTY CALL?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.008
THE GUY AT THE RES CLINIC

14:10.225 --> 14:11.590
SAID HE WAS POPULAR
WITH THE LADIES.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.596
MAYBE BEN WAS MEETING
ONE OF THEM

14:13.812 --> 14:16.178
UP THERE TO...
"PLAY DOCTOR."

14:24.489 --> 14:26.650
WALT:
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.698
ARE YOU, BY ANY CHANCE,

I'M DR. SYLVIA MALLORY.

14:31.455 --> 14:34.663

14:34.916 --> 14:37.953

I THINK YOU'RE HERE TO SEE ME.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.626
WELL, WE WERE JUST
ABOUT TO HEAD INSIDE --

14:39.838 --> 14:41.169
I CAN'T.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.248
I KNOW HOW HARD
THIS MUST BE.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.129
FACING THE LOSS OF A CHILD

14:46.345 --> 14:48.336
IS ABOUT THE WORST THING
A PARENT CAN GO THROUGH.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.173
I JUST CAN'T GO
THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.770
MY OLDEST SON, ANDREW,
WAS MURDERED IN DETROIT.

15:00.192 --> 15:01.932
THEY EVER FIGURE OUT
WHO DID IT?

15:02.152 --> 15:04.768
THE POLICE HAVE PRETTY MUCH
GIVEN UP AT THIS POINT.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.365
AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED,
ANDREW'S JUST ANOTHER ONE

15:07.574 --> 15:09.656
OF DETROIT'S
UNSOLVED MURDERS.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.942
THAT WAS A YEAR AGO.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.320
AND NOW BEN.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.991
DID BEN HAVE ANY ENEMIES?

15:19.211 --> 15:21.076
AH, NO.
HE MADE FRIENDS EVERYWHERE.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.127
HE ALWAYS VOLUNTEERED
FOR THE PLACES

15:23.340 --> 15:24.546
THAT NEEDED THE MOST HELP.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.290
HE WANTED TO BE
JUST LIKE YOU.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.125
OH, HE WAS A BETTER MAN
THAN I.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.173
NOW, I SPENT MY FAIR SHARE
OF TIME

15:31.390 --> 15:34.598
WORKING FOR RESERVATIONS
AND FREE CLINICS.

15:34.810 --> 15:38.177
BUT I DID IT TO PAY OFF
MY MEDICAL-SCHOOL BILLS.

15:38.397 --> 15:40.183
NOT BEN.

15:40.399 --> 15:42.185
BEN WAS DIFFERENT.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.858
HE WAS SELFLESS.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.526
BEN COULD AFFORD
TO BE SELFLESS.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.978
HE HAD YOU
TO SUPPORT HIM.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.734

TO DESERVE THIS?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.833
I KNOW
THIS IS DIFFICULT,

16:03.046 --> 16:05.628
BUT ANY INFORMATION YOU HAVE
MAY HELP.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.253
YEAH, WELL,
PLEASE, NO OFFENSE,

16:08.468 --> 16:09.844
BUT...

16:10.053 --> 16:13.591
I'M FINDING IT HARD TO
SEE THE POINT TO ALL THIS.

16:13.807 --> 16:17.299
WHEN ANDREW WAS KILLED,
I SPENT HOURS WITH THE POLICE,

16:17.519 --> 16:19.430
AND NOTHING CAME OF IT.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.851
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE,
MORE THAN YOU THINK.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.351
I'M SORRY I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT ANDREW'S CASE,

16:28.697 --> 16:31.154
BUT I CAN DO SOMETHING
ABOUT BEN'S.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.286

THIS TIME AROUND.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.787
TO THE DETROIT
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.174
ASK THEM FOR A COPY

16:48.341 --> 16:50.002
OF ANDREW MALLORY'S
MURDER FILE.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.628

16:51.845 --> 16:53.426
SINCE WHEN DID WE
START INVESTIGATING MURDERS

16:53.638 --> 16:55.139

16:55.348 --> 16:58.556
I'M JUST TAKING A LOOK

16:58.768 --> 16:59.928
IN THE MEANTIME,

17:00.937 --> 17:03.349
I GOT SOME INFORMATION
ON BEN MALLORY.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.479
THERE ARE NO ALLEGATIONS

17:05.692 --> 17:06.807

IN THAT EXAM ROOM,

17:15.076 --> 17:16.407

COULD HAVE SNAPPED.
