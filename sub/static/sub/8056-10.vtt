WEBVTT

00:08.203 --> 00:10.704
Come on, come on, come on.

00:10.772 --> 00:13.707
- Leslie Knope!
- Hey, Chris!

00:13.775 --> 00:14.708
Wow, is that
a new jogging shirt?

00:14.776 --> 00:16.177
It is!

00:16.216 --> 00:18.552
It's an experimental fabric
called bumble-flex.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.020
It's made out of
synthetic bees' wings.

00:20.038 --> 00:21.372
- That's cool.
- Anyway...

00:21.406 --> 00:22.856
You're not supposed to be here.
You're suspended.

00:22.891 --> 00:24.074
I totally understand that.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.525
I'm just going to, uh,
take my flash drive

00:25.543 --> 00:26.727
and I'll do
some work from home.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.095
N...

00:28.129 --> 00:30.230
...O. You are specifically
prohibited from doing your job.

00:30.265 --> 00:31.598
Oh, I'm not gonna do my job.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.350
I'm just gonna oversee
the department, and check in

00:33.385 --> 00:35.602
on the parks, and attend any
meetings that require

00:35.637 --> 00:37.054
- the deputy director.
- Leslie.

00:37.105 --> 00:41.108
Go home and give me
the flash drive.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.279
This is a nasal spray.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.947
Give me the flash drive.

00:46.982 --> 00:49.216
Give me the nasal spray.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.284
On three.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.285
One...

00:51.319 --> 00:52.486
- Two...
- Two...

00:52.520 --> 00:55.255
Three.

00:55.290 --> 00:57.825
Okay, good.
Now, in two weeks, you can--

00:57.859 --> 01:00.294
Leslie Knope!
I am much faster than you!

01:00.328 --> 01:02.046
I have bumble-flex!

01:05.099 --> 01:10.090

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.267 --> 01:24.184
It's so nice to be able
to sit here in public

01:24.218 --> 01:25.619
- and have breakfast with you.
- Yeah.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.221
In a way, my suspension from
work was kind of a blessing.

01:28.239 --> 01:31.442
Yeah, I feel the same way
about resigning in disgrace.

01:31.493 --> 01:33.627
Totally, the key is you have
to keep yourself busy,

01:33.661 --> 01:34.828
or else you're gonna go crazy.

01:34.863 --> 01:36.430
I mean, look at me,
look how busy I am.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.767
I'm inventing a new spice
called "sal-gar."

01:39.801 --> 01:41.835
It's part salt, part sugar.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.771
What could that possibly
be good on?

01:43.805 --> 01:46.006
- Butterscotch pudding.
- Fair enough.

01:46.041 --> 01:48.342
Okay, I have to go to this
meeting with my advisers.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.928
You have a big day, right?
Which interview is this?

01:50.962 --> 01:52.763
It's a job doing
in-house accounting work

01:52.797 --> 01:56.800
for an accounting firm, so...
could be pretty interesting.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.052
Yeah, sounds interesting.

01:58.086 --> 02:00.454
You know, if I hadn't
resigned in disgrace,

02:00.488 --> 02:02.656
I might never have explored
the private sector.

02:02.690 --> 02:06.426
It's like, why didn't I resign
in disgrace 12 years ago?

02:06.444 --> 02:09.145
You might want to stop saying
"resigned in disgrace."

02:09.197 --> 02:10.663
Especially during
job interviews.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.200
Good call.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.601
Leslie wishes
she could be here herself

02:14.636 --> 02:17.104
to give you these presents,
but she's suspended.

02:17.122 --> 02:19.156
Oh, and also she said
that they're not from her,

02:19.207 --> 02:21.243
- they're from Santa Claus.
- Can I go first?

02:24.295 --> 02:26.880
Mouse Rat,
certified gold!

02:26.915 --> 02:31.885
Over <i>100</i> copies sold in Pawnee!

02:31.920 --> 02:34.304
I need to get a picture of me
holding this so I can frame it.

02:34.339 --> 02:37.124
Personalized,
leopard-printed robe.

02:37.142 --> 02:38.959
Pink feather cuffs.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.962
And on the back,
in rhinestones...

02:41.980 --> 02:43.313
"You can get it"!

02:43.348 --> 02:44.731
I know you're sad
you couldn't get tickets

02:44.766 --> 02:48.135
to the "Watch the Throne" tour,
so I got you a watch

02:48.153 --> 02:50.037
and a tiny throne instead.

02:50.071 --> 02:52.072
And check it out, she even
took out the dumb clock part

02:52.107 --> 02:53.640
and put this in...

02:53.675 --> 02:55.075
"Baller Time."

02:55.110 --> 02:57.678
These are the Black-eyed Peas.

02:57.712 --> 03:01.031
And I finally killed them.

03:01.082 --> 03:03.016
It's a Christmas miracle.

03:03.051 --> 03:06.687
Every year, I give Leslie the
same present I give everyone:

03:06.721 --> 03:09.189
A crisp $20 bill.

03:09.224 --> 03:12.759
And every year, she gets me
something thoughtful

03:12.794 --> 03:14.228
and personal.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.930
It makes me furious.

03:16.965 --> 03:19.433
This year, she outdid herself.

03:22.604 --> 03:27.724
She had it installed
over the weekend.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.676
It's so--

03:29.694 --> 03:31.378
It's so beautiful.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.981
We need to get Leslie
something that erases

03:34.015 --> 03:36.867
the enormous emotional debt
that has built up over years

03:36.901 --> 03:38.869
of this gift-giving imbalance.

03:38.903 --> 03:40.621
Everyone start
thinking of ideas.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.623
Aw, jeez.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.408
Socks.

03:44.459 --> 03:45.692
She gets me.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.244
Hi, hi, hi, hi.
Sorry I'm late.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.863
I was off getting
holiday gifts for my team.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.883
William, here is
a Knope 2012 tree ornament.

03:52.917 --> 03:54.367
- Hey.
- And Elizabeth,

03:54.385 --> 03:59.389
I got you a Knope 2012...
Menorah...Maybe?

03:59.424 --> 04:01.141
- No.
- No, okay.

04:01.176 --> 04:02.375
Then I got you
a tree ornament.

04:02.393 --> 04:04.711
Okay, so let's talk
about damage control.

04:04.729 --> 04:07.047
Now, I could go on
<i>Pawnee Today,</i> but--

04:07.081 --> 04:08.265
and I know this is
a long shot--

04:08.316 --> 04:09.900
Oprah has her own network now.

04:09.934 --> 04:12.069
- Whoa, Leslie, slow down.
- The first step is for us

04:12.103 --> 04:13.554
to figure out what
we're up against,

04:13.588 --> 04:15.355
and we've already got polls out
in the field, and we should

04:15.389 --> 04:17.156
have results back
in a couple of days.

04:17.192 --> 04:20.327
Just stay out of the spotlight
until we can figure out

04:20.361 --> 04:22.946
just how this, uh, incident
has affected the voters.

04:22.997 --> 04:26.400
Sit tight,
take a beat, relax.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.902
"Sit tight"?
"Take a beat"? "Relax"?

04:28.937 --> 04:31.004
I don't really do
any of those things.

04:31.039 --> 04:32.472
In fact,
while I was in that meeting,

04:32.507 --> 04:36.043
I was also planning my mother's
birthday party in my head.

04:36.077 --> 04:37.878
Strawberry margaritas!

04:37.912 --> 04:39.780
Another use for sal-gar!

04:39.814 --> 04:43.684
Financial analysis,
automated general ledger

04:43.718 --> 04:46.687
accounting systems,
audit management.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.272
Hmm, you've done everything.

04:48.306 --> 04:50.991
Well, they call me
"the Swiss Army Accountant."

04:52.443 --> 04:54.528
- They don't call me that.
- They should.

04:54.562 --> 04:57.464
Well, look, I think
you'd be a great addition.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.000
Would you be willing to come
back to meet the division head?

05:00.034 --> 05:01.368
Yes, absolutely.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.620
- We'll set that up.
- Okay, great.

05:03.655 --> 05:07.457
- Thank you.
- Well, uh...

05:07.492 --> 05:09.459
Calc-you-later.

05:14.282 --> 05:16.300
Oh, you like that one, huh?

05:18.920 --> 05:20.754
We do not get
a lot of humor here,

05:20.788 --> 05:22.639
and when we do,
it's wonderful.

05:22.674 --> 05:25.025
- Oh.
- Ted! Come in here!

05:25.059 --> 05:29.563
Say it to Ted when he comes in.

05:29.597 --> 05:32.299
We could get Leslie
some marshmallow fluff.

05:32.317 --> 05:34.568
I have some right here.

05:34.602 --> 05:37.154
Correction, darling.
You <i>had</i> some right here.

05:37.188 --> 05:38.488
Did you just
scoop it out of the jar

05:38.523 --> 05:41.074
with your hand like a bear?
Yes.

05:41.109 --> 05:42.993
I can't get it off.
Can you help me?

05:43.027 --> 05:44.411
Behold!

05:44.445 --> 05:46.363
My latest attempt
to drag this department

05:46.414 --> 05:47.831
into the 20th century.

05:47.865 --> 05:50.183
- Tom, it's the 21st century.
- I know.

05:50.218 --> 05:51.818
I'd settle for
getting you into the 20th.

05:51.836 --> 05:55.589
I fed all of Leslie's
emails, letters, and memos

05:55.623 --> 05:57.758
into a program and generated...

05:57.792 --> 05:58.825
A word cloud.

05:58.843 --> 06:00.761
This is how we can
get gift ideas.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.597
The more she's mentioned a word,
the larger it appears.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.717
"Ben"...
And much larger, "Ann."

06:06.768 --> 06:09.336
- She definitely loves Ann.
- Aww.

06:09.354 --> 06:11.271
Okay.
I have an idea.

06:11.306 --> 06:14.708
I will build a small wood model
of the parks department.

06:14.742 --> 06:17.361
We can decorate our offices
as they are in real life.

06:17.395 --> 06:20.847
It will be...

06:20.882 --> 06:22.549
- Cute.
- Wait!

06:22.583 --> 06:24.401
Better idea:

06:24.452 --> 06:26.953
We make a gingerbread
version of the office.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.891
- That's so good!
- I think the wood model is--

06:30.925 --> 06:33.160
and we can decorate
our offices with candy canes

06:33.194 --> 06:34.461
and gumdrops!

06:34.495 --> 06:35.862
That would be so adorable!

06:35.880 --> 06:38.231
Thanks, Ron!
That's such a cute idea!

06:38.266 --> 06:41.385
I have some great red birch
with a nice spalting.

06:41.419 --> 06:44.604
I already have
some scale wainscoting.

06:44.639 --> 06:47.107
Mmm, I love me a calzone.

06:47.141 --> 06:49.426
Ben!
I'm going crazy!

06:49.477 --> 06:50.944
First, they won't let me work
in the parks department,

06:50.978 --> 06:52.646
now they won't let me
campaign either.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.048
All I want to do
is improve our town,

06:55.066 --> 06:56.516
and they won't let me do that!

06:56.551 --> 06:58.452
You're putting an awful lot
of sal-gar on your pasta.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.721
This is just sugar.
Okay, I need you to distract me.

07:00.755 --> 07:02.489
Talk to me about something.
Anything.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.391
Well, that accounting firm
is gonna make me a job offer.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.492
Oh, yeah?
That's great!

07:05.526 --> 07:06.626
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna take it?

07:06.661 --> 07:08.795
Well, it pays well.

07:08.830 --> 07:11.665
The commute is a little long,
but that's okay.

07:11.699 --> 07:16.470
I didn't love the carpeting,
but... eh.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.305
You know what I think?

07:18.339 --> 07:20.374
If you don't love it,
take a month.

07:20.408 --> 07:22.442
See what else is out there.

07:22.477 --> 07:23.677
Yeah. Yeah.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.679
And, you know, you can still
improve the city.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.382
You can't work right now,
or run a campaign.

07:28.416 --> 07:30.250
- Do it as a private citizen.
- Oh, my God.

07:30.268 --> 07:32.352
I'll form
a citizen action committee,

07:32.387 --> 07:33.653
I'll lobby from the outside,

07:33.688 --> 07:35.755
I'll harness the power
of the community.

07:35.773 --> 07:37.190
Oh, my God, I finally have
some work to do.

07:37.225 --> 07:40.560
Thank you so much
for dinner, honey.

07:40.595 --> 07:44.598
I can hear you breathing, and,
yes, you can finish her pasta.

07:47.452 --> 07:50.203
Thank God.
I'm so hungry.

07:50.238 --> 07:52.038
Mmm, it tastes
like froot loops.

07:53.738 --> 07:55.538
Wow! Great turn out.

07:55.738 --> 07:57.412
Okay, welcome everyone

07:57.413 --> 08:00.766
to the first meeting of
the Parks Committee of Pawnee,

08:00.800 --> 08:01.917
or PCP.

08:01.951 --> 08:04.603
Um, should we really
be called "PCP"?

08:04.637 --> 08:05.971
- See, because--
- Yes, because,

08:06.005 --> 08:09.808
like the drug PCP, we are
so fast-acting and powerful,

08:09.842 --> 08:11.076
we should be illegal.

08:11.110 --> 08:13.662
Now, what do you want to see
fixed in the parks? Yes?

08:13.696 --> 08:15.847
I've noticed that
the White Hills hiking path

08:15.882 --> 08:17.382
could really use some upkeep.

08:17.416 --> 08:19.434
I was thinking we organize
a letter-writing campaign.

08:19.469 --> 08:22.788
Uh, I-I know for a fact that
nobody in the parks department

08:22.822 --> 08:24.923
reads letters,
except for one person,

08:24.957 --> 08:29.294
who is amazing, but s-he
isn't currently there,

08:29.328 --> 08:31.463
because <i>he</i> was suspended.

08:31.497 --> 08:33.431
How amazing can he be
if he got suspended?

08:33.448 --> 08:35.866
Pretty damn amazing, Diane.
Now shush.

08:35.902 --> 08:38.270
If we want to get the government
off their bloated,

08:38.304 --> 08:41.323
bureaucratic butts, then we need
our voices to be heard,

08:41.374 --> 08:42.657
and that's what
we're gonna do.

08:42.707 --> 08:45.644
Clear eyes,
full hearts, can't lose.

08:45.678 --> 08:47.746
Ron is making the model,
and then we're going to put

08:47.780 --> 08:50.982
all of our candy decorations
in our corners of the office.

08:51.017 --> 08:52.116
Okay, so what
did everybody make?

08:52.134 --> 08:53.885
Boom!

08:53.920 --> 08:55.754
Rock n' roll candy Andy.
Wow.

08:55.788 --> 08:57.138
- Mmm.
- That's really good, son.

08:57.173 --> 08:59.024
I didn't do anything
for my office.

08:59.058 --> 09:00.509
It's okay,
I took care of it.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.644
I made a marshmallow
Ron Swanson.

09:04.347 --> 09:06.631
See? His arms are crossed
because he's mad at all

09:06.649 --> 09:09.351
the other marshmallow workers
for annoying him.

09:09.402 --> 09:11.186
You like it?

09:11.237 --> 09:12.637
It's fine.

09:12.672 --> 09:15.273
When I was trying to decide
how to decorate my office,

09:15.307 --> 09:18.610
I had to ask myself, "what kind
of candy should I choose?"

09:18.644 --> 09:21.162
Obviously chocolate,
'cause I'm sweet, smooth,

09:21.197 --> 09:22.914
and the ladies love me.

09:22.949 --> 09:25.834
Now the question still remained,
"what kind of chocolate am I?"

09:25.868 --> 09:28.019
Do I have a little gooey,
caramel center?

09:28.054 --> 09:30.522
Am I filled
with little rice krispies?

09:30.556 --> 09:32.657
Maybe I'm white chocolate and
I'm bucking all the stereotypes.

09:32.675 --> 09:34.158
Oh, just put
your damn candy out.

09:34.176 --> 09:38.496
Ultimately, I decided to go
with a little gourmet fudge.

09:38.514 --> 09:40.098
I didn't have time
to make it into anything,

09:40.132 --> 09:42.517
and please don't eat it
'cause it cost $55 an ounce.

09:42.552 --> 09:46.021
So I made my desk
out of silver m&ms.

09:46.055 --> 09:49.340
But they do not make silver
m&ms, so I spray-painted them.

09:49.358 --> 09:51.443
Okay, those are poisonous,
so no one eat them.

09:51.477 --> 09:52.861
Yeah, duh.

09:52.895 --> 09:54.779
- Go throw up.
- I didn't eat any.

09:54.814 --> 09:57.782
- Go throw up.
- Throw up.

09:57.817 --> 09:59.534
- Ben Wyatt.
- Hi.

09:59.569 --> 10:00.919
- Great to meet you.
- You too.

10:00.953 --> 10:03.521
I'm, uh, this.

10:03.539 --> 10:05.824
Well, thank you for meeting
with me, Mr. Feinstein.

10:05.858 --> 10:08.193
Please, call me
Dennis Feinstein.

10:08.227 --> 10:09.995
I'm gonna cut
right to the chase, Ben.

10:10.029 --> 10:11.997
This cologne company
is my life's work.

10:12.031 --> 10:14.900
Why should I trust you
with my perfumery?

10:14.934 --> 10:17.469
Well, uh, I've been in
government accounting for more

10:17.503 --> 10:20.672
than a decade, and I just think
it's time for a change.

10:20.706 --> 10:22.741
Listen, Ben, I'm gonna
cut right to the chase, okay?

10:22.775 --> 10:24.643
I like you--
I've always liked you--

10:24.677 --> 10:26.928
but I also like Eddie.

10:26.979 --> 10:28.413
Ed--who--who's Eddie?

10:28.447 --> 10:30.782
Eddie's my current CFO,

10:30.816 --> 10:34.603
but I might fire him
and hire you.

10:34.654 --> 10:35.937
- You got kids?
- No.

10:35.988 --> 10:37.489
That's good.
Dum-dum Eddie has two kids.

10:39.058 --> 10:40.425
Oh, God.
Don't fire Eddie.

10:40.459 --> 10:42.060
Why would you have him
in here in this interview?

10:42.094 --> 10:44.195
- Eddie, I am sorry--
- Don't talk to Eddie.

10:44.229 --> 10:48.249
Treat him like you would treat
a person in another country

10:48.284 --> 10:51.369
that you paid $25,000 to hunt.

10:51.404 --> 10:53.438
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

10:53.472 --> 10:55.256
I'm talking about
the best vacation of my life.

10:55.291 --> 10:56.708
Oh, my God.
Look, I'm sorry.

10:56.742 --> 10:59.911
I-I thought I wanted to
branch out a little career-wise,

10:59.946 --> 11:01.630
but that was a mistake.

11:01.681 --> 11:05.583
Keep Eddie.
I do not want this job.

11:05.601 --> 11:07.052
You're crazy, man.

11:07.086 --> 11:08.687
We'll be in touch.

11:08.689 --> 11:11.022
Okay, are there
any more recommendations

11:11.057 --> 11:12.590
for new games
at the rec center?

11:12.608 --> 11:14.693
My daughter, she loves
chutes and ladders.

11:14.727 --> 11:16.895
Oh, come on!

11:16.929 --> 11:19.314
There is no strategy
to chutes and ladders.

11:19.365 --> 11:21.800
- It's just luck.
- My daughter's five.

11:21.834 --> 11:23.485
Well, your daughter
is an idiot.

11:23.536 --> 11:24.836
Her daughter is an idiot!

11:24.870 --> 11:26.137
He daughter is an idiot!

11:26.172 --> 11:27.539
- No, no, no.
- Her daughter is an idiot!

11:27.573 --> 11:29.874
No, no she's not.
Hello, I am Leslie Knope,

11:29.909 --> 11:33.628
and I represent the PCP.

11:33.663 --> 11:35.279
We have a list of six demands.

11:35.297 --> 11:36.715
Here they are
in alphabetical order.

11:36.749 --> 11:37.916
Number one: Ants.

11:37.950 --> 11:39.300
Too many ants
in the teen center.

11:39.335 --> 11:41.219
Number two:
Tennis court improvements.

11:41.253 --> 11:43.888
- Number three--
- Well, Les--um, ma'am,

11:43.923 --> 11:46.825
uh, this public forum,
it is just about improvements

11:46.859 --> 11:48.093
that we can make
to the rec center.

11:48.127 --> 11:50.428
Speaking of which,
the fact that yahtzee is not

11:50.462 --> 11:55.333
in the rec center is a tragedy
on par with human trafficking.

11:55.368 --> 11:58.636
Slight exaggeration...
Getting back to our demands.

11:58.654 --> 12:01.306
We will not be muzzled
like a rabid dog.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.191
We are gonna take this
all the way to the top.

12:03.242 --> 12:04.743
Yay!

12:04.777 --> 12:06.661
Okay, we have made
some waves here, people,

12:06.696 --> 12:08.363
but we need to keep
this momentum going.

12:08.414 --> 12:11.049
Now, the city manager's name
is Chris Traeger.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.384
I want to take
this fight to him.

12:12.418 --> 12:13.885
Ooh, a letter-writing campaign!

12:13.919 --> 12:15.503
God, Diane,
will you stop it

12:15.538 --> 12:17.122
with the letter-writing
campaign? No.

12:17.156 --> 12:19.791
I have his office number.
I want one of you calling it

12:19.825 --> 12:21.042
every 15 minutes.

12:21.093 --> 12:23.378
We are also going to protest
along his jogging route,

12:23.429 --> 12:26.848
and I need someone in every
GNC within a five-mile radius

12:26.882 --> 12:29.300
- of the city center.
- But there are only 12 of us.

12:29.334 --> 12:31.502
- 13.
- Look! Our numbers are growing!

12:31.520 --> 12:34.039
There's nothing we can't do
if we work hard, never sleep,

12:34.073 --> 12:36.041
and shirk all other
responsibilities in our lives.

12:36.075 --> 12:39.644
You with me?

12:47.870 --> 12:51.189
I can handcraft 17-foot canoes
out of western red cedar,

12:51.223 --> 12:54.025
but I can't glue two damn
Graham crackers together!

12:54.060 --> 12:56.077
Look, it's really easy.

12:56.128 --> 12:57.729
I know a lot about candy.

12:57.763 --> 13:00.048
I play with it, I eat it.

13:00.082 --> 13:02.050
Sometimes I play with it
<i>and</i> eat it.

13:02.084 --> 13:04.335
Boom!

13:04.370 --> 13:05.553
Okay, new plan.

13:05.588 --> 13:07.639
Everyone else makes
this candy house,

13:07.673 --> 13:10.892
and I make myself
useful elsewhere.

13:10.926 --> 13:12.844
Your 11:00 is here.

13:12.878 --> 13:15.346
Concerned citizen and
community leader Leslie Knope.

13:15.381 --> 13:16.898
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Leslie.

13:16.932 --> 13:18.382
You're not supposed
to be here.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.452
As a government employee,
that's true, but I am just here

13:20.486 --> 13:23.605
as a concerned citizen
and founder of PCP.

13:23.656 --> 13:25.323
The Parks Committee of Pawnee.

13:25.357 --> 13:27.492
Those are the people
that have been harassing me.

13:27.526 --> 13:29.994
We have many demands.
Specifically, these six unfunded

13:30.029 --> 13:32.113
projects that need
to be dealt with immediately.

13:32.164 --> 13:33.397
- Well--
- Not good enough!

13:33.415 --> 13:35.834
Leslie,
out of respect for you,

13:35.868 --> 13:37.836
I will meet with your group,
but I hope that this

13:37.870 --> 13:39.504
puts an end to the madness.

13:39.538 --> 13:41.506
Prepare for battle.

13:41.540 --> 13:43.341
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
I got your Christmas present.

13:43.375 --> 13:46.010
It's like a little stopwatch
that records your jogging times

13:46.045 --> 13:47.846
and then sends it to
your computer via Bluetooth.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.347
Ahh!

13:49.381 --> 13:51.599
- That is so thoughtful!
- Aww.

13:51.634 --> 13:54.636
My pleasure.
See you in hell!

13:56.055 --> 13:58.623
Well, I see you've taken
our advice about relaxing.

13:58.657 --> 14:00.608
Oh, this is just
a little militant citizen group

14:00.643 --> 14:01.976
I slapped together.

14:02.027 --> 14:03.828
But enough about me,
what are my polling results?

14:03.863 --> 14:06.865
Uh, well, before the scandal,
you were at 26%.

14:06.899 --> 14:09.534
Now, we knew we'd take a hit,
but we figured as long as

14:09.568 --> 14:12.153
we're at 15% or above,
we're still in the fight.

14:12.204 --> 14:14.272
And we're at 15%?

14:14.306 --> 14:17.008
We went back to 26%?
Whoa, wait.

14:17.042 --> 14:17.992
50%?

14:18.043 --> 14:20.011
We're at one.

14:20.045 --> 14:21.880
One... hundred?

14:21.914 --> 14:23.665
You're polling at 1%.

14:23.716 --> 14:25.884
What? No.
That can't be right.

14:25.918 --> 14:28.553
Okay, well, what we do
is we move forward from this.

14:28.587 --> 14:30.454
How do we put
a positive spin on this?

14:30.472 --> 14:32.490
- There's no way to spin this.
- Sure there is.

14:32.525 --> 14:34.993
You're looking at the glass
like it's 99% empty.

14:35.027 --> 14:36.728
I'm looking at it
like it's 1% full.

14:36.762 --> 14:40.098
You know, the last delicious
sip of a milkshake

14:40.132 --> 14:42.183
at the bottom
of the metal milkshakey thing?

14:42.234 --> 14:44.686
It's very hard to come back
from this kind of thing.

14:44.737 --> 14:46.204
You know, a sex scandal
with your boss.

14:46.238 --> 14:48.406
Oh, like you're
so pure and chaste.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.342
Please, I know the two of you
are sleeping together.

14:51.377 --> 14:55.163
It's obvious, with all your
glances and your sly smiles.

14:55.197 --> 14:57.832
- I'm gay.
- Well, never mind then.

14:57.867 --> 15:01.853
It's a small town.
There's nowhere to hide.

15:01.887 --> 15:04.522
We can't run
your campaign anymore.

15:04.557 --> 15:06.841
I'm sorry, Leslie.
You were a great candidate,

15:06.876 --> 15:09.894
but...it's over.

15:15.056 --> 15:16.555
Could you maybe find
new advisors?

15:16.556 --> 15:18.590
I can't. I talked
to everyone in the entire state

15:18.624 --> 15:19.941
who's ever run a campaign.

15:19.976 --> 15:21.927
Nobody wants
a candidate who's polling

15:21.961 --> 15:25.246
- at "last milkshake sip" levels.
- Can I say something?

15:25.264 --> 15:28.183
This sucks, I am not gonna
convince you that it doesn't,

15:28.217 --> 15:30.185
and you can tell me
every day for the next year

15:30.219 --> 15:32.354
- about how much this sucks.
- One year--you said one year.

15:32.388 --> 15:34.306
- That's on the record.
- And I meant it.

15:34.357 --> 15:38.193
But eventually this'll pass.
You're gonna get through this.

15:38.227 --> 15:40.429
I don't know if I'm going to.

15:40.463 --> 15:43.431
I mean, look, I return
to my old job in a week,

15:43.449 --> 15:46.434
and that's great because
I love my old job, but...

15:46.452 --> 15:49.538
My heart was really
set on this new job.

15:49.572 --> 15:53.375
Ann.

15:53.409 --> 15:55.210
Don't touch my pickles, Ann!

15:57.814 --> 16:00.966
B-b-b-b-Ben-jammin'!

16:01.000 --> 16:02.801
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

16:02.835 --> 16:05.120
Hey, Jean-Ralphio.
How's it going?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.722
It's going good, I'm actually
right here for an appointmt.

16:07.757 --> 16:10.625
Getting a Brazilian.
By the way, there's a woman

16:10.643 --> 16:12.627
over there that is unbelievable.
Her name is Kim.

16:12.645 --> 16:14.563
When she rips it off,
she smiles,

16:14.597 --> 16:15.897
and it makes you feel things.

16:15.932 --> 16:17.432
Throw my name,
I get a referral discount.

16:17.466 --> 16:19.434
- If you don't mind.
- Okay.

16:19.468 --> 16:21.469
I heard somebody
resigned in disgrace.

16:21.487 --> 16:23.572
My question to you is,
how you making that paper?

16:23.606 --> 16:26.908
Oh, well, I've interviewed
around, uh, but I'm actually

16:26.943 --> 16:28.777
about to take a job
doing in-house accounting

16:28.811 --> 16:31.496
- for an accounting firm.
- Buh...

16:31.531 --> 16:32.914
I almost fell asleep
during that sentence.

16:32.949 --> 16:34.082
- Okay.
- Let me get this straight.

16:34.117 --> 16:37.169
You would be an accountant...

16:37.203 --> 16:39.321
- For accountants?
- Yeah.

16:39.355 --> 16:43.158
So at this accounting firm,
<i>you</i> would have the boring job?

16:43.192 --> 16:45.293
Are you nuts?
This is probably the first time

16:45.328 --> 16:46.761
you've had off since
you've been kid president.

16:46.796 --> 16:48.763
- True or false?
- True.

16:48.798 --> 16:51.600
Why don't you use that time and
go after one of your passions,

16:51.634 --> 16:54.436
like model trains or, like,
or toy Gandalfs or something?

16:54.470 --> 16:57.272
I don't know why you jumped
straight to model trains.

16:57.306 --> 16:59.374
I mean... it's accurate.

16:59.408 --> 17:02.277
I'm gonna tell you something
that I once heard from a very,

17:02.311 --> 17:06.181
- very smart woman named Kim.
- The lady who waxes you?

17:06.214 --> 17:09.617
She told me, "if you don't
love what you do...

17:09.652 --> 17:11.419
Then why do it?"

17:11.454 --> 17:13.204
Then she ripped the hair
from my b-hole.

17:15.358 --> 17:17.291
Ron filled me in
on everything that happened,

17:17.326 --> 17:20.095
and I really wish
that the ethics investigation

17:20.128 --> 17:22.196
hadn't interfered
with your campaign in any way.

17:22.231 --> 17:25.200
You don't have to apologize.
You were very fair.

17:25.233 --> 17:28.069
In fact, I'm the one
that needs to apologize.

17:28.104 --> 17:31.206
I got you involved in PCP.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.875
But I'm starting
a new group now, LSD--

17:33.893 --> 17:35.410
Leslie's Sorry Division--

17:35.444 --> 17:38.380
and I just want to say
I'm sorry, Chris.

17:38.414 --> 17:41.149
Oh, that's nice
of you to say.

17:41.184 --> 17:45.187
Anyway, now,
for your Christmas present.

17:49.942 --> 17:53.395
Your suspension's been lifted.
Please, come back to work.

17:53.929 --> 17:55.263
Thank you.

17:56.298 --> 17:58.466
Hey, what are you doing here?

17:58.501 --> 17:59.784
Hey.

17:59.835 --> 18:03.171
Uh, I just wanted to tell you
something in person.

18:03.706 --> 18:04.789
Oh, my God,
I'm pregnant.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.609
Wait, what?
No, that's not it.

18:07.643 --> 18:11.246
I turned down
that accounting job.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.648
Just didn't feel right.
That's okay, right?

18:13.683 --> 18:15.650
Yeah.
I think that's great.

18:15.685 --> 18:17.652
- I'm really proud of you.
- Yeah?

18:17.687 --> 18:20.105
What are you
gonna do instead?

18:20.139 --> 18:23.775
- I have no idea.
- I like it.

18:23.809 --> 18:25.777
Okay, well, I guess
I'll just see you at home.

18:25.811 --> 18:27.062
Well, they're having
a party in here.

18:27.096 --> 18:28.480
Why don't you stay?

18:28.531 --> 18:31.432
Actually, I think
you should go in alone.

18:39.959 --> 18:43.161
- What's going on here?
- Merry Christmas, Leslie!

18:43.212 --> 18:45.446
We made you this replica
of the parks department

18:45.464 --> 18:48.667
out of gingerbread.
Oh, my God, I love it!

18:48.718 --> 18:50.952
Aw, I love it,
and I love you guys,

18:50.987 --> 18:53.171
and Ann specifically.
And all of you!

18:53.222 --> 18:55.473
You did all of this together?

18:55.508 --> 18:58.143
Yes,
except for me.

18:58.177 --> 19:01.096
Turns out, I cannot make
a gingerbread house,

19:01.130 --> 19:04.432
which would bother me
if I were an 8-year-old girl.

19:04.466 --> 19:07.769
In any case, these people
stepped up and helped me out,

19:07.803 --> 19:09.573
and that gave me another idea.

19:12.108 --> 19:15.076
This is
the city council chambers,

19:15.111 --> 19:17.545
and that's you, next may.

19:17.580 --> 19:20.165
I don't understand.

19:20.199 --> 19:22.684
Your campaign advisers quit,
big deal.

19:22.718 --> 19:24.686
You're running
for city council again, Leslie,

19:24.720 --> 19:26.672
with our help.

19:27.707 --> 19:32.227
April Ludgate, youth outreach
and director of new media.

19:32.261 --> 19:35.864
Tom Haverford, image
consultant, swagger coach.

19:35.898 --> 19:39.267
Ann Perkins, office manager
and volunteer coordinator.

19:39.302 --> 19:43.438
Andy Dwyer, security,
sweets, body man.

19:43.472 --> 19:44.906
Javelin, if need be.

19:44.940 --> 19:49.944
Donna Meagle, transpo,
AKA rides in my Benz.

19:51.447 --> 19:53.782
W--you guys didn't tell me
we were doing this.

19:53.816 --> 19:55.700
I--I did not know
that I was supposed to

19:55.735 --> 19:57.152
come up with something. I--

19:57.186 --> 20:02.824
Ron Swanson, any other
damn thing you might need.

20:02.858 --> 20:05.060
Guys, it's so much work.

20:05.094 --> 20:07.295
I can't ask you to put
your lives on hold.

20:07.330 --> 20:09.530
Find one person here
who you haven't helped

20:09.548 --> 20:11.969
by putting your life on hold.

20:14.303 --> 20:16.606
I don't know what to say...

20:18.140 --> 20:20.775
Except...

20:20.810 --> 20:24.929
Let's go win an election!

20:24.980 --> 20:28.600
Giving Christmas gifts
is like a sport to me.

20:28.651 --> 20:31.903
Finding or making
that perfect something.

20:31.937 --> 20:33.288
- Come on.
- It's also like a sport to me

20:33.322 --> 20:34.739
because I always win.

20:34.774 --> 20:38.276
This year, though?
My friends won.

20:38.327 --> 20:40.662
In fact, I got my ass
handed to me.

20:43.193 --> 20:45.493
- Welcome, Mr. Saperstein.
- Thank you so much.

20:45.528 --> 20:47.145
I will just show
to your cubicle.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.296
I can't wait.
I bet it's a big one,

20:48.314 --> 20:50.965
- huh Barney?
- Um, the, uh, temp agency said

20:50.983 --> 20:53.134
that you are fluent
with Quickbooks Pro, correct?

20:53.152 --> 20:54.536
Oh, right, yeah,
we should cover that.

20:54.570 --> 20:57.672
You see, my resume might not
actually be accurate, right?

20:57.707 --> 20:59.157
So I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.509
Don't know
what Quickbooks are.

21:01.544 --> 21:03.495
You don't have
any accounting experience?

21:03.529 --> 21:06.114
No, no, no, Barney, come on.
But you don't have to be

21:06.148 --> 21:09.117
an accountant to know
that this girl is a ten.

21:09.151 --> 21:11.369
Yo, what up, D.S.?
You come here often?

21:11.420 --> 21:12.454
To my job?

21:12.488 --> 21:13.705
Ooh, she got
a mouth on her also.

21:13.756 --> 21:15.206
- Shut it.
- Is this the new temp

21:15.257 --> 21:16.941
who's supposed to help me
with the spreadsheets?

21:16.976 --> 21:18.209
You want to talk
about spreading and sheets,

21:18.260 --> 21:20.228
we can go back to my place
and I will rock your--

21:20.262 --> 21:22.213
- You're fired!
- That makes sense.

21:22.264 --> 21:24.382
So I just go out
the same way I came in?
