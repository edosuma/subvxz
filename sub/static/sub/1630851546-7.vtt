00:15.450 --> 00:17.713
Another petrified rat carcass?

00:17.756 --> 00:21.412
Ooh, this creature went all-in
on the morbid decorations. Ugh.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.633
Yeah, we'll bring this to Nick.

00:24.676 --> 00:28.289
If he can take it apart,
then we can figure out

00:28.332 --> 00:30.334
when the entity
was first locked up here.

00:30.378 --> 00:33.990
How did Hannah even know
about this place?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.644
And why'd she release

00:35.687 --> 00:38.560
a supernatural killer
and then go off the grid?

00:38.603 --> 00:40.344
Yeah, and not to make
this all about me,

00:40.388 --> 00:42.346
but, boy, is this terrible
timing for George Fan.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.000
I could really
use Hannah's input

00:44.044 --> 00:45.654
on this knock-off
soul-splitter.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.134
I would like to live my whole
life, thank you very much.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.613
But Bess is on that
for you, right?

00:48.657 --> 00:50.528
She's been researching stuff?

00:50.572 --> 00:51.964
Yeah, she collected
some other artifacts

00:52.008 --> 00:53.357
from Bertram Bobbsey's cache

00:53.401 --> 00:54.793
of black-market relics
from the Civil War.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.186
We're pretty sure
the soul-splitter is

00:56.230 --> 00:57.448
in his storage locker.

00:57.492 --> 00:58.754
Ace got the key from Amanda.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.103
The place opens in two hours.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.670
Wow, that's promising.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.193
I mean, if we can
do this ritual right,

01:03.237 --> 01:05.282
maybe I won't have to die
in ten years after all.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.252
Ooh! [gasps]

01:18.295 --> 01:19.818
Whoa.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.342
I've been
called worse.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.778
What are you doing down here?

01:22.821 --> 01:24.345
None of my texts
are going through.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.868
Yeah, ain't no cell
service in this cell.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.739
We have a slight wrinkle.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.393
Mr. Bobbsey told the cops
about his storage locker,

01:29.437 --> 01:30.873
so if we don't get there
first...

01:30.916 --> 01:32.396
No soul-splitter for us.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.268
Okay, change of plans.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.660
New mission.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.401
We beat the cops
to the soul-splitter

01:37.445 --> 01:39.447
and we save George's
life today.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.378
NANCY: That's the
Bobbsey's storage locker

01:57.421 --> 01:58.901
in that building there.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.470
ACE:
That was a very short mission.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.428
We're too late. We
need a miracle now.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.517
Or a lawyer.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.523
Just the incredibly handy man
I was looking for.

Hey.Okay,

02:13.872 --> 02:16.397
um, so, Nancy
is looking for clues

02:16.440 --> 02:17.833
about the supernatural killer

02:17.876 --> 02:19.269
who was once imprisoned
in this lock.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.705
Can you please
examine this thing

02:20.749 --> 02:22.359
for age, origin,
etcetera, etcetera?

02:22.403 --> 02:23.926
Yeah.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.797
Yeah, ooh, and meanwhile,

02:25.841 --> 02:27.843
George has gone
to Bobbsey's storage locker

02:27.886 --> 02:30.498
with Ace and Nancy to see
about the lead we found.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.500
See? Full disclosure.

02:32.543 --> 02:36.068
Yeah, okay. Uh, this-this lead
you're talking about--

02:36.112 --> 02:37.722
is this the relic

02:37.766 --> 02:39.420
that could untangle
George's soul from Odette's?

02:39.463 --> 02:41.944
That very one.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.902
Meanwhile,

02:43.946 --> 02:47.906
I may have ulterior motives
for being here.

Well, if it isn't the most
interesting woman in the world.

What's on the agenda today?

02:59.004 --> 03:00.615
Slaying a dragon?No, no.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.400
Unfortunately, my dragon-slaying
sword is in the shop.

03:03.444 --> 03:07.187
But I was wondering what your
plans were for dinner tonight.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.189
Tonight?

03:09.232 --> 03:11.974
Um, I'm in.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.715
Yeah.[phone vibrates]

03:13.758 --> 03:15.630
Sorry. Uh, I have to take this,

03:15.673 --> 03:17.066
but I'll call you later

03:17.109 --> 03:19.068
to figure out
the plans.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.070
Hey, yeah, I let Nick know
what you were doing.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.898
Full disclosure,
as instructed.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.769
GEORGE: Hold that thought.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.945
How much do you know
about the soul-splitter ritual?

03:26.989 --> 03:29.339
Ah, I mean,
I've-I've read a bit,

03:29.383 --> 03:31.167
but I've barely
scratched the surface.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.560
Scratch harder, Bess.
Today's the day.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.388
What?

03:34.431 --> 03:36.390
The cops are tagging items
from Bobbsey's storage unit.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.261
If we can get our hands
on that soul-splitter,

03:38.305 --> 03:40.350
we'll have to get it back before
anyone knows it's missing.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.787
So, I'm sorry, but that means
au revoir to Odette today.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.963
Today... Oh.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.269
I don't want to tell Nick
what's going on

03:46.313 --> 03:47.618
until we know
What's actually happening.

03:47.662 --> 03:48.837
I don't want to worry him
for no reason.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.142
So, can you do the ritual
or not?

03:52.971 --> 03:55.235
[sighs]
Ah.

03:55.278 --> 03:58.020
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
We have to try.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.892
Bess is gonna meet us
at Nancy's house.

Here comes the rest
of the cavalry.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.386
This should keep the police from
going in there any time today.

How much do I want to know
about why this is happening?NANCY: I...

04:19.389 --> 04:21.826
did something, by accident,
to George,

04:21.870 --> 04:24.394
and it caused a life crisis,
and I need to fix it.

04:24.438 --> 04:28.616
With a 19th-century relic that
Bertram Bobbsey has in storage?

04:28.659 --> 04:31.749
Yeah. Uh, George's life
depends on it.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.925
Hey, it's all good.
We're here to help.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.666
Thank you.

Thanks.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.061
Both of... you.Yeah,

04:39.104 --> 04:41.106
well, I-I drove him here
because my car is faster,

04:41.150 --> 04:43.631
and he over-brakes.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.200
What? No.
Also for moral support.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.334
Why wasn't I informed
about this?

04:51.378 --> 04:54.206
Hey.Bertram Bobbsey's case

04:54.250 --> 04:56.513
also concerns my client
Asher Davies.

He has a vested interest
in the contents

04:59.168 --> 05:01.692
of this storage unit, one that
may conflict with the D.A.'s.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.999
You'll get a full evidence log
in discovery.

05:04.042 --> 05:06.871
No, we have to
delay discovery

05:06.915 --> 05:09.831
until there's a third party
on site to monitor this search.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.485
This is your
ex parte notice.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.051

hearing this afternoon.

It's all yours,
Counselor.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.321
You can put that down.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.764
You know, this could have been
so much easier.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.374
You just had
to break up with Amanda.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.594
You couldn't wait one more day?

05:33.637 --> 05:35.596
You broke up with Amanda?

05:35.639 --> 05:37.598
She broke up with me.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.382
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.518
Problem, Officer?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.258
I was told to
clear the area.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.043
Go home, kids.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.088
Especially you, Nancy.

05:51.176 --> 05:53.918
I'm gonna text the dads,
tell 'em to meet us at the house

05:53.962 --> 05:55.355
once they have the relic.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.272
We're sure this is legal, right?

06:00.316 --> 06:03.406
I'm allowed to look at evidence
concerning my client.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.061
And it's not like we're
breaking and entering.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.933
They gave us a key,
you let us in.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.806
Here.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.851
This is what we're looking for.

make this up to the D.A.?

you're into her.

No, I'm not. We're
sharing information

on a case.
That's all.Okay.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.606
Right. I saw the way
you looked at her.

this conversation?

Um, does it have to be beetles?
'Cause... all those legs.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.881
Well, the potion
is very specific.

08:53.924 --> 08:57.537
It causes your soul to more
easily separate from your body.

08:57.580 --> 09:01.541
Now, you need to take this an
hour before we start the ritual.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.585
When the device
starts working,

09:02.629 --> 09:04.805
your soul and Odette's

09:04.848 --> 09:08.548
will be stored
in this crystal here.

09:08.591 --> 09:12.508
Then we will use
the soul-splitter

09:12.552 --> 09:16.338
to separate the souls
in the crystal.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.688

yours back into your body.

this ritual by sundown,

I'm unavailable tonight.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.245
you don't always
see options for the future.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.986
Some kids lose hope.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.641
My cousin did, you know,
that's why he took his own life.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.817
Oh. I'm...

20:09.860 --> 20:11.862
I'm sorry.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.300
I mean, that had
to be traumatic.And, look,

20:14.343 --> 20:16.519
I'm sure what you
went through was no picnic.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.129
But you learned
to process it, right?

20:18.173 --> 20:21.220
For me, it was a walkabout--
you know, no phone, no Internet.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.004
Just six months
on the Appalachian Trail

20:23.047 --> 20:24.614
and I just really
got my head right.

20:24.658 --> 20:25.833
[exhales]
Wow.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.226
What'd your walkabout
look like?

20:27.269 --> 20:29.097
Uh...

20:29.140 --> 20:30.794
um, well, um...

20:30.838 --> 20:33.319
I came to Horseshoe Bay

20:33.362 --> 20:35.059
to say thank you
to my social worker,

20:35.103 --> 20:37.497
who happened to be Nancy's
mom, and it turned out

20:37.540 --> 20:39.586
that, um...

20:39.629 --> 20:41.718
she'd passed.Oh.

20:41.762 --> 20:44.199
And I, um, tried to reconnect
with an old friend

20:44.243 --> 20:47.028
that helped me,
but she also died.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.943
Uh, I dated Nancy
for a while,

20:48.986 --> 20:50.553
but then we
broke up and...

20:50.597 --> 20:54.253
I bought the Claw and I got into
a relationship with George,

20:54.296 --> 20:56.385
and then I bought
a couple more buildings,

20:56.429 --> 20:58.779
and then I started
this youth center and...

20:58.822 --> 21:00.998
That is ten

21:01.042 --> 21:03.044
different journeys.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.700
Which one do you think
helped you process your trauma?

21:06.743 --> 21:09.050
I'm not sure.

21:11.922 --> 21:14.316
You know, you just, um...

21:14.360 --> 21:16.884
you just...

21:16.927 --> 21:19.321
wake up one day and it's like,

21:19.365 --> 21:21.541
okay.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.804
This is my life.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.196
It worked out, right?

21:25.240 --> 21:28.330
CAMERON:
Addy. We need the pirate ship.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.723
Coming up!

21:29.766 --> 21:31.768
[chuckles]

21:34.728 --> 21:36.164
I'll take those.There you go.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.992
Thank you.

21:38.035 --> 21:40.299
All right,
who ordered a pirate ship?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.083
[door closes]

21:42.126 --> 21:43.737
I got it!Oh, my God, okay!

21:43.780 --> 21:45.391
Okay, thank you.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.436
Oh, God.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.961
Hey.I'm ready.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.572
Let's do this.

21:52.615 --> 21:55.183
Okay.

21:59.056 --> 22:02.669
Sentinels of the world
beyond, grant us

22:02.712 --> 22:04.975
passage to the realm of souls.

22:05.019 --> 22:08.283
Where there was one,
now two reside.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.899
I offer myself
as conduit

22:15.943 --> 22:17.684
for your power,
that I might

22:17.727 --> 22:20.295
withdraw the entangled souls
and return them

22:20.339 --> 22:22.558
to their rightful place.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.140
Does that mean it's working?

22:39.183 --> 22:40.837
That's the first step.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.187
Now both George's
and Odette's souls are out.

22:43.231 --> 22:46.756
How do we know that...
th-that's George's soul?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.455
Or Odette's?The book says that

22:49.498 --> 22:51.108
the brightest light will be
the-the soul

22:51.152 --> 22:52.283
that belongs to the body.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.677
The softer, fainter
light will be

22:54.721 --> 22:56.679
the unwanted inhabiter.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.420
Odette's soul.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.683
Hey, we got to keep going.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.946
What's next?

23:02.990 --> 23:05.253
Okay.
[sniffles]

23:05.296 --> 23:08.038
Um, now we need to, uh, split

23:08.082 --> 23:10.867
the crystal at the mid-point,
and separate the souls.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.435
We'll put George's back
into her body while Odette's

23:13.479 --> 23:15.742
will remain in her
half of the crystal.Okay.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.352
Okay.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.503
[exhales]

23:53.344 --> 23:55.521
Now to return George's soul
back into her body.

23:57.218 --> 24:00.482
Soul once lost
has now been found,

24:00.526 --> 24:03.267
no longer tangled
in the web of the void.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.053
We now return you, soul,

24:06.096 --> 24:08.708
to your rightful place.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.410
[gasps][gasping] George!

24:15.454 --> 24:17.847
Was that...

24:17.891 --> 24:20.415
What?

24:20.459 --> 24:22.939
Why is the light
back in the crystal?I-I don't know. It...

24:22.983 --> 24:26.029
it's not working. No.

24:33.559 --> 24:34.908
GEORGE: Hey, it's George.
Leave a short message.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.649
[beep]Hey, uh, so, I sent

24:36.692 --> 24:39.608
pics of the lock Nancy was
asking about to the group.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.523
I'm just checking
that you got them.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.657
And, um...

24:44.700 --> 24:47.486
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.751
But we can talk later.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.105
Are you sure
that you did it right?

24:58.148 --> 25:00.368
No. Obviously,
I'm not sure.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.762
I've never actually done
a soul exorcism before.

25:02.805 --> 25:05.329
Besides, the ritual was meant

25:05.373 --> 25:07.331
for the original type
of soul-splitter,

25:07.375 --> 25:09.551
not Beckett Dow's
specialty version.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.858
Did you say Beckett Dow?Yeah, he's the metalsmith

25:11.901 --> 25:13.773
that made this device
in the Civil War.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.036
His initials are
on the soul-splitter.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.568
B.D.-- Beckett Dow.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.396
Oh, my God, yeah.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.006
He-he must've been the locksmith

25:30.050 --> 25:31.921
that made the lock
for the underground cage.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.880
There were some things down in
the cage I didn't get a chance

25:33.923 --> 25:35.534
to look through, so maybe
there's something aboutGreat.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.231
the soul-splitter in there?Yeah, yeah.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.798
It's choking me.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.713
It's not choking you.
You just don't like it.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.584
I had to wear one
for my Bar Mitzvah.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.151
I hated it, too,
but you look great.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.719
You don't need a tie, bro.You definitely need a tie.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.982
You need to convince
this judge to delay

25:49.025 --> 25:51.071
the storage locker search
until tomorrow.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.508
We'll put the soul-splitter
back later tonight.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.250
Okay.JUDGE: Mr. Drew, we're waiting.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.252
Okay, let's go, let's go.

25:58.295 --> 25:59.949
Come on, come on.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.516
Here.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.345
Now, put this in here.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.608
Leave that on.Okay.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.568
Shoulders back,
chin up, enunciate.

26:20.274 --> 26:22.842
JUDGE:All right, Counselor.
You're seeking

26:22.885 --> 26:25.235
an injunction of the
evidence collection?

26:25.279 --> 26:27.150
Where's Jean?

26:27.194 --> 26:29.370
I mean,
D.A. Rosario.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.851
Where's...
Wasn't she supposed to be here?

26:31.894 --> 26:34.549
Mr. Drew,
A.D.A. Francouer

26:34.593 --> 26:36.507
is perfectly capable
of representing

26:36.551 --> 26:38.553
the D.A.'s office
at this hearing.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.903
Your Honor, speaking for the
D.A.'s office, we will obviously

26:40.947 --> 26:42.644
provide Mr. Drew with
any and all evidence

26:42.688 --> 26:45.647
pertaining to his client.Well...

26:45.691 --> 26:47.388
Uh...Yes, Mr. Drew?

26:48.868 --> 26:51.827
Well, the...
the thing is,

26:51.871 --> 26:54.351
my client-- Asher...

26:54.395 --> 26:56.353
JUDGE:
Let's begin again, please.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.704
Coherently this time.

26:58.747 --> 27:01.315
Damn. I should've given
him pointers on this, too.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.199
♪

27:21.030 --> 27:23.511
Oh...

27:25.861 --> 27:28.603
God, no cell service
in this cell.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.694
[phone vibrates]Oh.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.391
Nancy?

27:34.435 --> 27:36.132
[distorted]: Bess?

27:36.176 --> 27:37.568
Oh, God, I can barely hear you.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.396
Yeah, there's not a lot
of signal in the tunnels.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.703
Listen, I found
a set of notes in the cage.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.966
Beckett Dow's soul-splitter
was designed

27:44.010 --> 27:46.534
to split one soul
into multiple pieces.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.405
It was not designed
to disentangle

27:48.449 --> 27:50.973
two souls from each other.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.801
Okay, so how do we fix this?

27:52.845 --> 27:54.585
Well, in order
to complete the ritual,

27:54.629 --> 27:56.152
only George's soul
can be present.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.546
That means we need to destroy
the other crystal.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.983
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Destroy?

28:01.027 --> 28:02.724
No, no, no, Odette is in here.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.813
Maybe "destroy" meant
something else back then?

28:04.857 --> 28:06.510
"Destroy" means "destroy."

28:06.554 --> 28:07.860
This is the only way
to get George's soul

28:07.903 --> 28:08.861
back into her body.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.123
No, no, listen, it can't be

28:10.166 --> 28:11.559
the only way.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.517
What if-what if we keep them
both here?

28:13.561 --> 28:15.868
George gets her body back,
and Odette finds a new one.

28:15.911 --> 28:18.348
Odette finds a new body?

28:18.392 --> 28:21.090
Has that been your plan
this entire time?

28:21.134 --> 28:23.702
My plan? No.
It was not my plan, it just...

28:23.745 --> 28:26.052
It's just after talking
to Father Shane, it was an idea

28:26.095 --> 28:27.967
that became
a hope that became...

28:28.010 --> 28:29.098
Odette is dead, Bess.

28:29.142 --> 28:30.752
She's been dead
for a long time.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.058
And it may not be fair,

28:32.101 --> 28:33.799
but she should have
moved on to peace.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.583
And it's my fault she hasn't.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.541
And it's my fault that we're
in this mess to begin with.

28:37.585 --> 28:40.893
So we have to finish the ritual
and save George.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.198
Bess?

28:43.243 --> 28:44.635
Damn it.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.605
FRANCOEUR: Your Honor,
if Mr. Drew cannot produce

28:57.648 --> 29:00.608
a single piece of documentation,
then how does he expect you

29:00.651 --> 29:01.957
to consider his request?

29:02.001 --> 29:04.438
Dude, Carson is
tanking in there.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.788
Maybe he can
pull it together.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.747
The elixir's got
to wear off soon, right?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.618
You feeling any different?

29:10.661 --> 29:12.794
Hey, Ryan.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.970
Hey! Wait!

29:15.014 --> 29:17.538
Excuse me,
you can't go in there.Uh, pardon me, Your Honor,

29:17.581 --> 29:19.670
I'm Ryan Hudson.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.542
I got this.You're in the wrong place.

29:21.585 --> 29:23.762
Lawyer guy,
I wasn't talking to you.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.068
And I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.330
Hi.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.376
Oh, sorry.
[clears throat]

29:29.419 --> 29:32.118
Mr. Hudson,
this is a closed session.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.381
Unless you have business
in this chamber...

29:34.424 --> 29:37.253
I do, actually,
because one of the items

29:37.297 --> 29:39.603
in the storage unit
belongs to the Hudson family.

29:39.647 --> 29:42.693
To be clear, you are also
involved in this dispute?

29:42.737 --> 29:44.957
Yep. I mean, correct...

29:45.000 --> 29:48.874
a-amundo, as-as they say
in the original Latin.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.963
Counselor,
were you aware of this?

29:51.006 --> 29:53.052
Not until just now.That is also correct...

29:53.095 --> 29:55.837
a-amundo.Mr. Drew, it appears
you're acting

29:55.881 --> 29:57.752
as Mr. Hudson's attorney

29:57.796 --> 30:00.276
in addition
to your client Mr. Davies?

30:00.320 --> 30:02.452
Right.If this client

30:02.496 --> 30:04.193
also has standing in the case,

30:04.237 --> 30:05.760
then you realize I cannot
hold this hearing today.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.197
This is a time-sensitive matter.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.156
It's a storage unit.
It's not going anywhere.

30:10.199 --> 30:13.202
Mr. Hudson needs
to file paperwork

30:13.246 --> 30:15.814
and cite his interest
before we can proceed.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.033
Adjourned.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.777
Hey, G.G.,
Mr. Boring Lawyer Man.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.997
That was awesome.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.651
[exhales]

30:34.615 --> 30:36.617
You found me.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.796
Where are you and Odette headed?

30:43.493 --> 30:45.974
You must think
I'm a terrible friend.

30:46.018 --> 30:48.063
No. Anything but.

30:48.107 --> 30:51.197
It's just that when you said
I had to destroy Odette,

30:51.240 --> 30:53.503
I... I panicked.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.549
You know, I didn't
think I was gonna have

30:55.592 --> 30:57.725
to say goodbye today.I know.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.858
I'm sorry I pushed you earlier.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.252
I was so worried
about saving George,

31:03.296 --> 31:05.689
I didn't stop to think
what Odette means to you.

31:08.214 --> 31:10.520
So what now?

31:11.957 --> 31:14.133
I don't know.

31:14.176 --> 31:16.048
I'm lost.
