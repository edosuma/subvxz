WEBVTT

00:15.450 --> 00:17.713
Another petrified rat carcass?

00:17.756 --> 00:21.412
Ooh, this creature went all-in
on the morbid decorations. Ugh.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.633
Yeah, we'll bring this to Nick.

00:24.676 --> 00:28.289
If he can take it apart,
then we can figure out

00:28.332 --> 00:30.334
when the entity
was first locked up here.

00:30.378 --> 00:33.990
How did Hannah even know
about this place?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.644
And why'd she release

00:35.687 --> 00:38.560
a supernatural killer
and then go off the grid?

00:38.603 --> 00:40.344
Yeah, and not to make
this all about me,

00:40.388 --> 00:42.346
but, boy, is this terrible
timing for George Fan.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.000
I could really
use Hannah's input

00:44.044 --> 00:45.654
on this knock-off
soul-splitter.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.134
I would like to live my whole
life, thank you very much.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.613
But Bess is on that
for you, right?

00:48.657 --> 00:50.528
She's been researching stuff?

00:50.572 --> 00:51.964
Yeah, she collected
some other artifacts

00:52.008 --> 00:53.357
from Bertram Bobbsey's cache

00:53.401 --> 00:54.793
of black-market relics
from the Civil War.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.186
We're pretty sure
the soul-splitter is

00:56.230 --> 00:57.448
in his storage locker.

00:57.492 --> 00:58.754
Ace got the key from Amanda.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.103
The place opens in two hours.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.670
Wow, that's promising.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.193
I mean, if we can
do this ritual right,

01:03.237 --> 01:05.282
maybe I won't have to die
in ten years after all.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.719
[loud thud]

01:07.763 --> 01:09.765
[water dripping]

01:13.986 --> 01:15.510
Uh-uh, not today,
you heart-freezing,

01:15.553 --> 01:16.641
hat-wearing son of a...

01:16.685 --> 01:18.252
Ooh! [gasps]

01:18.295 --> 01:19.818
Whoa.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.342
I've been
called worse.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.778
What are you doing down here?

01:22.821 --> 01:24.345
None of my texts
are going through.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.868
Yeah, ain't no cell
service in this cell.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.739
We have a slight wrinkle.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.393
Mr. Bobbsey told the cops
about his storage locker,

01:29.437 --> 01:30.873
so if we don't get there
first...

01:30.916 --> 01:32.396
No soul-splitter for us.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.268
Okay, change of plans.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.660
New mission.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.401
We beat the cops
to the soul-splitter

01:37.445 --> 01:39.447
and we save George's
life today.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.667
â™ª

01:55.811 --> 01:57.378
NANCY: That's the
Bobbsey's storage locker

01:57.421 --> 01:58.901
in that building there.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.470
ACE:
That was a very short mission.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.428
We're too late. We
need a miracle now.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.517
Or a lawyer.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.523
Just the incredibly handy man
I was looking for.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.829
Hey.Okay,

02:13.872 --> 02:16.397
um, so, Nancy
is looking for clues

02:16.440 --> 02:17.833
about the supernatural killer

02:17.876 --> 02:19.269
who was once imprisoned
in this lock.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.705
Can you please
examine this thing

02:20.749 --> 02:22.359
for age, origin,
etcetera, etcetera?

02:22.403 --> 02:23.926
Yeah.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.797
Yeah, ooh, and meanwhile,

02:25.841 --> 02:27.843
George has gone
to Bobbsey's storage locker

02:27.886 --> 02:30.498
with Ace and Nancy to see
about the lead we found.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.500
See? Full disclosure.

02:32.543 --> 02:36.068
Yeah, okay. Uh, this-this lead
you're talking about--

02:36.112 --> 02:37.722
is this the relic

02:37.766 --> 02:39.420
that could untangle
George's soul from Odette's?

02:39.463 --> 02:41.944
That very one.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.902
Meanwhile,

02:43.946 --> 02:47.906
I may have ulterior motives
for being here.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.998
[clears throat]

02:54.304 --> 02:57.394
Well, if it isn't the most
interesting woman in the world.

02:57.438 --> 02:58.961
What's on the agenda today?

02:59.004 --> 03:00.615
Slaying a dragon?No, no.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.400
Unfortunately, my dragon-slaying
sword is in the shop.

03:03.444 --> 03:07.187
But I was wondering what your
plans were for dinner tonight.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.189
Tonight?

03:09.232 --> 03:11.974
Um, I'm in.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.715
Yeah.[phone vibrates]

03:13.758 --> 03:15.630
Sorry. Uh, I have to take this,

03:15.673 --> 03:17.066
but I'll call you later

03:17.109 --> 03:19.068
to figure out
the plans.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.070
Hey, yeah, I let Nick know
what you were doing.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.898
Full disclosure,
as instructed.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.769
GEORGE: Hold that thought.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.945
How much do you know
about the soul-splitter ritual?

03:26.989 --> 03:29.339
Ah, I mean,
I've-I've read a bit,

03:29.383 --> 03:31.167
but I've barely
scratched the surface.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.560
Scratch harder, Bess.
Today's the day.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.388
What?

03:34.431 --> 03:36.390
The cops are tagging items
from Bobbsey's storage unit.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.261
If we can get our hands
on that soul-splitter,

03:38.305 --> 03:40.350
we'll have to get it back before
anyone knows it's missing.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.787
So, I'm sorry, but that means
au revoir to Odette today.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.963
Today... Oh.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.269
I don't want to tell Nick
what's going on

03:46.313 --> 03:47.618
until we know
What's actually happening.

03:47.662 --> 03:48.837
I don't want to worry him
for no reason.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.142
So, can you do the ritual
or not?

03:52.971 --> 03:55.235
[sighs]
Ah.

03:55.278 --> 03:58.020
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
We have to try.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.892
Bess is gonna meet us
at Nancy's house.

04:00.936 --> 04:03.155
Here comes the rest
of the cavalry.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.296
Motion's been filed.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.386
This should keep the police from
going in there any time today.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.346
How much do I want to know
about why this is happening?NANCY: I...

04:19.389 --> 04:21.826
did something, by accident,
to George,

04:21.870 --> 04:24.394
and it caused a life crisis,
and I need to fix it.

04:24.438 --> 04:28.616
With a 19th-century relic that
Bertram Bobbsey has in storage?

04:28.659 --> 04:31.749
Yeah. Uh, George's life
depends on it.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.925
Hey, it's all good.
We're here to help.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.666
Thank you.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.320
Thanks.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.061
Both of... you.Yeah,

04:39.104 --> 04:41.106
well, I-I drove him here
because my car is faster,

04:41.150 --> 04:43.631
and he over-brakes.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.200
What? No.
Also for moral support.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.334
Why wasn't I informed
about this?

04:51.378 --> 04:54.206
Hey.Bertram Bobbsey's case

04:54.250 --> 04:56.513
also concerns my client
Asher Davies.

04:56.557 --> 04:59.124
He has a vested interest
in the contents

04:59.168 --> 05:01.692
of this storage unit, one that
may conflict with the D.A.'s.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.999
You'll get a full evidence log
in discovery.

05:04.042 --> 05:06.871
No, we have to
delay discovery

05:06.915 --> 05:09.831
until there's a third party
on site to monitor this search.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.485
This is your
ex parte notice.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.051
I've called

05:13.095 --> 05:15.967
for an emergency injunction
hearing this afternoon.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.926
Everyone, stop.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.362
It's all yours,
Counselor.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.321
You can put that down.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.764
You know, this could have been
so much easier.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.374
You just had
to break up with Amanda.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.594
You couldn't wait one more day?

05:33.637 --> 05:35.596
You broke up with Amanda?

05:35.639 --> 05:37.598
She broke up with me.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.382
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.518
Problem, Officer?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.258
I was told to
clear the area.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.043
Go home, kids.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.088
Especially you, Nancy.

05:51.176 --> 05:53.918
I'm gonna text the dads,
tell 'em to meet us at the house

05:53.962 --> 05:55.355
once they have the relic.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.272
We're sure this is legal, right?

06:00.316 --> 06:03.406
I'm allowed to look at evidence
concerning my client.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.061
And it's not like we're
breaking and entering.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.933
They gave us a key,
you let us in.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.806
Here.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.851
This is what we're looking for.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.597
So, how are you gonna
make this up to the D.A.?

06:20.641 --> 06:22.164
[sighs]It's, like, I know
you're into her.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.644
What?

06:23.687 --> 06:25.820
No, I'm not. We're
sharing information

06:25.863 --> 06:27.430
on a case.
That's all.Okay.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.606
Right. I saw the way
you looked at her.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.000
Can we maybe not have
this conversation?

06:32.043 --> 06:34.176
Please?

06:35.264 --> 06:37.005
[glass breaking, hissing]And can you please

06:37.048 --> 06:38.920
not destroy
any other potential evidence?

06:38.963 --> 06:40.356
Yeah.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.923
Yeah, yeah.

06:45.317 --> 06:48.843
"Juvenescence Elixir
gives the user reduced

06:48.886 --> 06:50.540
inhibitions of youth."

06:50.584 --> 06:52.324
[sniffs]
Ah.

06:52.368 --> 06:53.848
That's a strong smell.Hey!

06:53.891 --> 06:55.284
[groans]

06:55.327 --> 06:57.504
Bobbsey guy's
into some crazy stuff.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.680
Eesh. [groans, sniffs]

07:01.856 --> 07:04.119
Oh, ho, ho.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.817
You see, I might be clumsy,
but I get the job done.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.820
That's it.Yes. Here. Let me
take a picture of it.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.867
Got it?Mm-hmm.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.696
Yeah. Right here.[whooshing]

07:15.739 --> 07:17.524
There you go.
[clears throat]

07:17.567 --> 07:19.874
God. Here, use my jacket
to keep it safe.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.353
Oh, good call.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.138
[phone whooshes]

07:23.181 --> 07:25.488
Okay, Nancy says,

07:25.532 --> 07:28.099
"Bring it back ASAP."

07:28.143 --> 07:30.188
[laughs]
What? ASAP?

07:30.232 --> 07:31.929
[both laugh]

07:31.973 --> 07:34.758
Why do you got
to be like that, Mom?

07:34.802 --> 07:37.065
Like we work for her
or something?

07:37.108 --> 07:39.894
"Bring it to the
house, ASAP!"ASAP!

07:39.937 --> 07:42.723
[laughing]:
Take a chill pill, Nancy.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.420
Why am I wearing this?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.987
I do not know, bro.
You shouldn't be.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.467
Hold that.

07:50.644 --> 07:54.082
No. No. No.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.432
[gasps]
Oh, yeah.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.652
I think I like
this much better.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.828
Oh, dude, that's you.Right?

08:01.872 --> 08:03.004
Oh.

08:03.047 --> 08:06.094
Oh, sweet.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.665
[laughing]

08:11.708 --> 08:13.275
Let's take it for a spin.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.451
BESS:
So, I've studied the ritual.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.453
Even though the soul-splitter
wasn't actually designed

08:17.497 --> 08:19.281
for the purpose of
soul untangling...

08:19.324 --> 08:20.804
Oh, just tell me
that you can do it.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.546
I can do it. Yes.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.548
Where's the soul-splitter?ACE: It's on its way.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.115
Yeah, Carson and Ryan
are bringing it here.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.160
And they totally know
how important this is.

08:29.204 --> 08:31.293
Totally.Totally.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.210
[whooping]

08:35.253 --> 08:37.386
BOTH:
Yeah!

08:37.429 --> 08:39.475
[engine revving]

08:45.568 --> 08:47.439
Yes! I found a beetle.

08:47.483 --> 08:51.574
Um, does it have to be beetles?
'Cause... all those legs.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.881
Well, the potion
is very specific.

08:53.924 --> 08:57.537
It causes your soul to more
easily separate from your body.

08:57.580 --> 09:01.541
Now, you need to take this an
hour before we start the ritual.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.585
When the device
starts working,

09:02.629 --> 09:04.805
your soul and Odette's

09:04.848 --> 09:08.548
will be stored
in this crystal here.

09:08.591 --> 09:12.508
Then we will use
the soul-splitter

09:12.552 --> 09:16.338
to separate the souls
in the crystal.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.688
And then we'll only put
yours back into your body.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
Ryan and Carson

09:20.385 --> 09:22.344
should be here any minute
with the relic.

09:22.387 --> 09:25.129
As long as we finish
this ritual by sundown,

09:25.173 --> 09:27.044
all should be fine.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.569
That is, if you're
still sure about this.Bess, I'm a...

09:29.612 --> 09:31.005
[whirring]Oh, sorry, sorry. Yeah?

09:31.048 --> 09:33.007
I am a 1,000% sure

09:33.050 --> 09:34.617
that I want to live, okay?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.750
For Nick, for my sisters,
but mostly for myself.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.186
This could be my only chance.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.622
You want me to trust you,
Woman in White?

09:39.666 --> 09:40.971
I'm trusting you.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.016
Let's do this.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.675
Bottoms up.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.764
Bottoms up.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.289
[phone vibrates]

09:54.332 --> 09:56.596
So, tonight?

09:56.639 --> 09:59.599
BESS:
You know, what? Actually,
I'm unavailable tonight.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.644
It involves this friend
of mine from France.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.385
Oh, surprise houseguest?

10:03.428 --> 10:05.082
I've been there.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.258
Hey, you should
bring your friend.

10:07.302 --> 10:10.479
I mean, you know,
unless it's an ex. [laughs]

10:12.699 --> 10:15.049
Oh.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.225
Look, I'm really sorry
to cancel,

10:17.268 --> 10:19.270
but we hadn't
quite made plans yet,

10:19.314 --> 10:21.490
so, is it canceling, exactly?

10:21.533 --> 10:24.667
Anyway, thank you
for understanding.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.669
â™ª

10:31.282 --> 10:32.414
Okay, where
is the soul-splitter?

10:32.457 --> 10:33.937
It's been over an hour.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.286
I thought you said the storage
unit was 15 minutes away.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.114
Maybe there's traffic.

10:37.158 --> 10:41.118
There's never traffic
in Horseshoe Bay.[phone vibrates]

10:41.162 --> 10:43.164
Hi, Jesse. W...

10:44.339 --> 10:46.167
He's doing what?

10:46.210 --> 10:48.082
â™ª [whooping, exclaiming]

10:48.125 --> 10:50.301
[tires squealing]

10:50.345 --> 10:51.912
[engine revving]

10:51.955 --> 10:55.742
Yeah! [whooping]

11:01.922 --> 11:03.924
â™ª I want to take you down to.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.234
What's up, party people?ACE: Holy balls.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.106
I have so many questions.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.847
Is that the 302 or the 390?

11:14.891 --> 11:16.676
I don't know.NANCY: I told you

11:16.719 --> 11:18.068
to come straight home.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.462
I told you
to come straight home!

11:20.505 --> 11:21.593
Are you mocking me?

11:21.637 --> 11:23.683
Are you mocking me?
[laughs] I'm kidd...

11:23.726 --> 11:26.076
Where's Mr. D?

11:26.120 --> 11:29.863
Mr. D?. Why-why are you calling
Carson Mr. D?

11:29.906 --> 11:31.865
I mean, what do you want
me to call you? Mister...

11:31.908 --> 11:33.736
Mi... Wait.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.695
What is your last name?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.131
Where is the soul-splitter?

11:37.174 --> 11:38.828
Hmm?The thing that

11:38.872 --> 11:39.916
I told you to get.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.701
Oh, yeah! Yeah, right.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.094
Carson totally has it.
Like, one hundo.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.009
He took it with him
when I dropped him off.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.011
[phone vibrates]Oh.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.448
[laughs]: Oh!

11:50.492 --> 11:52.494
My video's, like,
totally blowing up.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.670
Check it out.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.106
Oh, no.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.368
What the hell
happened to them?

11:57.412 --> 11:58.630
â™ª

11:58.674 --> 12:00.545
RYAN: Go, go!

12:00.589 --> 12:02.373
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.766
BOTH: Yeah!

12:03.810 --> 12:05.376
NANCY:
Oh.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.640
Does that say
"Juvenescence Elixir"?

12:08.684 --> 12:10.164
"Gives users

12:10.207 --> 12:12.775
"reduced inhibition of youth.

12:12.819 --> 12:16.039
Effects wane before
the next sunrise."

12:18.259 --> 12:20.000
Ah.Huh.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.916
Oh, my God,
my dads are teenagers.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.266
Don't worry.
I speak the language.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.442
So, dude, where's my Carson?

12:27.485 --> 12:29.009
I dropped him off
at a girl's house.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.619
Totally smokeshow, by the way.

12:30.662 --> 12:31.968
And what was her name?

12:32.012 --> 12:34.492
Uh, it was, uh,
uh, Jenny...

12:34.536 --> 12:36.538
No, Jan... uh, Janine.NANCY: Oh, my God.

12:36.581 --> 12:37.669
Jean?Yes.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.846
That's it. Smokeshow Jean.

12:39.889 --> 12:44.415
Okay, so you're telling me that
my-my father has been reverted

12:44.459 --> 12:46.809
to an inhibition-free teenager,

12:46.853 --> 12:49.420
and you just dropped him off at
the district attorney's house?

12:49.464 --> 12:51.161
Yeah.

12:51.205 --> 12:54.034
But don't worry. I totally gave
him pointers. [clicks tongue]

12:54.077 --> 12:55.513
[strumming guitar]

12:55.557 --> 12:57.298
All good.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.952
So, there's a few different ways

12:58.995 --> 13:01.215
to figure out how old
something like this is.

13:01.258 --> 13:04.261
Uh, the-the shape and the type
of metal they use.

13:04.305 --> 13:08.875
And also, these initials.
See that?

13:08.918 --> 13:10.137
"B.D."

13:10.180 --> 13:13.444
That is the metalsmith's stamp.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.751
So did you want to be
a metalsmith when you grew up?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.972
No, he wanted to play football.
Remember how good he is?

13:19.015 --> 13:20.756
Yeah. How good were you?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.193
I led our high school team
in rushing my sophomore year.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.456
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.849
I made All-State in Florida.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.286
Wow. Did you play
in college, too?

13:29.330 --> 13:31.723
No. No.
I didn't go to college.

13:33.769 --> 13:34.857
Why not?

13:34.901 --> 13:37.251
Um...

13:40.428 --> 13:44.084
Well...

13:44.127 --> 13:46.086
after my sophomore year,

13:46.129 --> 13:48.871
I was involved in an incident.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.395
And...

13:51.439 --> 13:53.484
I got arrested.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.009
I was in

13:56.052 --> 13:58.663
a correctional facility,
and I finished

13:58.707 --> 14:00.143
my G.E.D.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.539
But I did not go to college.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.499
Hey, guys,

14:08.543 --> 14:10.327
um, super nacho crackers

14:10.371 --> 14:12.764
versus pizza-flavored crackers?

14:12.808 --> 14:14.766
I'm gonna need volunteers
for a taste test.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.594
Who's in?KIDS: Yeah.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.168
Carson.

14:25.212 --> 14:29.433
Look, I, uh... I understand
that you have a job to do,

14:29.477 --> 14:31.000
but I... I do, too, and...

14:31.044 --> 14:32.567
Oh, actually,
no, no, no, no.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.830
That's not actually
why I'm here.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.093
Then why are you here?Uh...

14:37.137 --> 14:38.747
you smell really good.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.184
Okay.Uh, wait. Oh,
no, no, no, no.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.143
I... I'm here

14:43.186 --> 14:46.276
because...

14:46.320 --> 14:49.236
I'm here because I want
to say something to you.

14:49.279 --> 14:52.587
Something that I... I should
have told you, like,

14:52.630 --> 14:56.112
a long time ago, but every time
I'm-I'm around you,

14:56.156 --> 15:00.595
my heart races,
because I'm-I'm wondering

15:00.638 --> 15:02.814
what it might be like to...

15:02.858 --> 15:04.555
What?

15:04.599 --> 15:05.905
Dad!

15:07.776 --> 15:09.560
Oh, man.[car door closes]

15:09.604 --> 15:10.953
NANCY:
Dad?

15:10.997 --> 15:12.999
My dad is not
feeling well today.

15:13.042 --> 15:17.307
So... So, you have
a lovely home. See ya.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.874
She was about to say something.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.920
Well, we're not gonna stick
around to find out what it was.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.488
So, dude, did you tell her?

15:24.532 --> 15:25.925
I got so close.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.405
Oh, man. Next time, bro.
Next time.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.017
I understand that you guys
are not yourselves right now,

15:31.060 --> 15:32.714
but I really need
the soul-splitter

15:32.757 --> 15:35.108
and then we can have, like,
the most raddest day ever, okay?

15:35.151 --> 15:36.805
Okay. Ry-guy's got it.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.241
What?
No. No, you got it.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.982
Uh-uh. You had it last.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.985
What?Oy vey.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.118
I think that mystical beetle
smoothie is hitting me.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.947
BESS:Okay, yup, yup. That's
great. Not to worry.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.426
A slight hiccup
with the soul-splitter,

15:49.470 --> 15:51.689
but Nancy knows
that time is of the essence,

15:51.733 --> 15:53.822
and any delay can cause
side effects to your brain

15:53.865 --> 15:55.476
and your immortal soul, and...

15:55.519 --> 15:57.217
Oh, my God! George!

15:57.260 --> 16:01.047
Oh, my God. George?Wake up.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.842
Tell me everywhere
you've been today.

16:13.885 --> 16:14.843
Well...Okay.

16:14.886 --> 16:15.844
Yeah, uh, first

16:15.887 --> 16:17.454
we went to this
rad guitar shop,

16:17.498 --> 16:19.152
I got a guitar.We're starting a band.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.718
Okay, so we got
to go the music shop.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.024
RYAN:
Yeah, right, cool.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.895
And after that, we'll
go ride some dirt bikes.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.071
N-No, I don't think so.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.376
Why, come on,
my family's got

16:26.420 --> 16:27.987
this awesome big barn
with all these toys

16:28.030 --> 16:29.510
in it we can totally ride.Ry-guy took me by there

16:29.553 --> 16:30.685
for a little while, showed meAll right, listen...

16:30.728 --> 16:32.252
the most amazing motocross...Listen...

16:32.295 --> 16:34.036
Listen!

16:34.080 --> 16:36.865
It's very important
that we find the soul-splitter.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.519
Okay? I'm talking

16:38.562 --> 16:41.304
life or death stakes.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.872
Okay, so...

16:43.915 --> 16:46.266
that's a yes on the dirt bikes?

16:46.309 --> 16:48.572
Just got to retrace
their steps.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.271
Hey, bingo!

16:51.314 --> 16:53.055
That's my man.That's a good idea.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.752
[slurping]

16:57.320 --> 17:00.410
[exhales]

17:00.454 --> 17:03.631
What happens if we don't find
the soul-splitter in time?

17:05.198 --> 17:07.504
Your soul would
become detached.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.637
Outside your body.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.682
Like Odette's, before
she entwined with you.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.815
Like an astronaut

17:13.858 --> 17:16.252
on a spacewalk, but
without the cable thing.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.080
But your body
will still be alive.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.604
Untethered astronaut.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.302
Got it.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.826
Hey, should we call Nick?No.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.089
I don't want him
to see me like this.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.483
I don't want to get his hopes up
until we know what's going on.

17:30.788 --> 17:34.140
So we'll just call him
when we have an actual update.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.185
George, can you hear me?

17:39.971 --> 17:42.104
Either of you?

17:44.846 --> 17:46.717
[gasps]

17:46.761 --> 17:48.589
Mon chÃ©ri...

17:50.243 --> 17:51.418
Odette?

17:52.854 --> 17:54.508
You're still here.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.466
[exhales]

17:56.510 --> 17:58.816
Did Nancy text back?

18:01.428 --> 18:03.430
No, no text yet.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.652
We're sorry we lost it.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.090
Yeah, Nancy, we're sorry.[phone chimes]

18:11.133 --> 18:13.657
Sorry.[sighs]

18:17.183 --> 18:19.010
B.D.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.751
Look!

18:20.795 --> 18:23.406
Oh, my God.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.452
[panting]

18:27.845 --> 18:29.412
Yes.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.197
That's it, so...

18:31.240 --> 18:33.590
now that we found
that thing you wanted...

18:33.634 --> 18:35.375
it's dirt bike time, right?

18:35.418 --> 18:38.291
Think the answer's
still no.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.336
Okay, I'm gonna bring
the soul-splitter

18:40.380 --> 18:42.295
to George and Bess, you just...

18:42.338 --> 18:44.471
make sure
that they don't die, please.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.386
[engine starts]

18:48.214 --> 18:50.999
Cool. I'll just...[engine starts]

18:51.042 --> 18:53.001
[whooping]No! Okay.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.959
Very funny.
Get out of the car.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.178
No, come on in.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.398
Yeah, come on.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.269
Hey, aren't you coming?CARSON: Say "Ace."

19:00.313 --> 19:01.923
Come on, let's go.Ha, ha, ha. Yep, yep...

19:01.966 --> 19:04.186
Say cheese. Bye!This is fun...

19:04.230 --> 19:07.189
Don't toy with Florence, hey.
Hey. Hey. Wow.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.235
[phone chiming]

19:12.020 --> 19:13.674
Mr. D.

19:13.717 --> 19:16.067
You're supposed to be
at the court in 30 minutes

19:16.111 --> 19:18.200
for an ex parte hearing
with the judge.What?

19:18.244 --> 19:20.159
Can I maybe skip that?No.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.378
If the cops find out
that you took the soul-splitter

19:22.422 --> 19:24.075
from the storage unit,
you'll get disbarred.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.426
Do I need to speak
to this judge?

19:26.469 --> 19:28.297
Because public speaking
kind of...

19:28.341 --> 19:30.386
is terrifying.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.259
[typing]

19:36.914 --> 19:38.786
Hey, Nick, they're working
on a reenactment

19:38.829 --> 19:40.396
of Cameron's favorite anime arc.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.355
They need an ocean
and a pirate ship.

19:42.398 --> 19:45.967
[chuckles] You don't run
out of energy, do you?

19:46.010 --> 19:47.621
I like stretching
their minds.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.188
You know, I wish
we had a place like this

19:49.231 --> 19:50.754
when I was growing up.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.103
It might've saved a few lives.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.236
Oh, wow, that's high praise.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.412
Yeah, well, this...

19:56.456 --> 19:58.849
this place shows kids
what's possible.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.025
And when you grow up
on a reservation,

20:01.069 --> 20:03.245
you don't always
see options for the future.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.986
Some kids lose hope.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.641
My cousin did, you know,
that's why he took his own life.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.817
Oh. I'm...

20:09.860 --> 20:11.862
I'm sorry.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.300
I mean, that had
to be traumatic.And, look,

20:14.343 --> 20:16.519
I'm sure what you
went through was no picnic.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.129
But you learned
to process it, right?

20:18.173 --> 20:21.220
For me, it was a walkabout--
you know, no phone, no Internet.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.004
Just six months
on the Appalachian Trail

20:23.047 --> 20:24.614
and I just really
got my head right.

20:24.658 --> 20:25.833
[exhales]
Wow.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.226
What'd your walkabout
look like?

20:27.269 --> 20:29.097
Uh...

20:29.140 --> 20:30.794
um, well, um...

20:30.838 --> 20:33.319
I came to Horseshoe Bay

20:33.362 --> 20:35.059
to say thank you
to my social worker,

20:35.103 --> 20:37.497
who happened to be Nancy's
mom, and it turned out

20:37.540 --> 20:39.586
that, um...

20:39.629 --> 20:41.718
she'd passed.Oh.

20:41.762 --> 20:44.199
And I, um, tried to reconnect
with an old friend

20:44.243 --> 20:47.028
that helped me,
but she also died.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.943
Uh, I dated Nancy
for a while,

20:48.986 --> 20:50.553
but then we
broke up and...

20:50.597 --> 20:54.253
I bought the Claw and I got into
a relationship with George,

20:54.296 --> 20:56.385
and then I bought
a couple more buildings,

20:56.429 --> 20:58.779
and then I started
this youth center and...

20:58.822 --> 21:00.998
That is ten

21:01.042 --> 21:03.044
different journeys.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.700
Which one do you think
helped you process your trauma?

21:06.743 --> 21:09.050
I'm not sure.

21:11.922 --> 21:14.316
You know, you just, um...

21:14.360 --> 21:16.884
you just...

21:16.927 --> 21:19.321
wake up one day and it's like,

21:19.365 --> 21:21.541
okay.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.804
This is my life.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.196
It worked out, right?

21:25.240 --> 21:28.330
CAMERON:
Addy. We need the pirate ship.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.723
Coming up!

21:29.766 --> 21:31.768
[chuckles]

21:34.728 --> 21:36.164
I'll take those.There you go.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.992
Thank you.

21:38.035 --> 21:40.299
All right,
who ordered a pirate ship?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.083
[door closes]

21:42.126 --> 21:43.737
I got it!Oh, my God, okay!

21:43.780 --> 21:45.391
Okay, thank you.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.436
Oh, God.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.961
Hey.I'm ready.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.572
Let's do this.

21:52.615 --> 21:55.183
Okay.

21:59.056 --> 22:02.669
Sentinels of the world
beyond, grant us

22:02.712 --> 22:04.975
passage to the realm of souls.

22:05.019 --> 22:08.283
Where there was one,
now two reside.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.899
I offer myself
as conduit

22:15.943 --> 22:17.684
for your power,
that I might

22:17.727 --> 22:20.295
withdraw the entangled souls
and return them

22:20.339 --> 22:22.558
to their rightful place.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.140
Does that mean it's working?

22:39.183 --> 22:40.837
That's the first step.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.187
Now both George's
and Odette's souls are out.

22:43.231 --> 22:46.756
How do we know that...
th-that's George's soul?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.455
Or Odette's?The book says that

22:49.498 --> 22:51.108
the brightest light will be
the-the soul

22:51.152 --> 22:52.283
that belongs to the body.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.677
The softer, fainter
light will be

22:54.721 --> 22:56.679
the unwanted inhabiter.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.420
Odette's soul.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.683
Hey, we got to keep going.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.946
What's next?

23:02.990 --> 23:05.253
Okay.
[sniffles]

23:05.296 --> 23:08.038
Um, now we need to, uh, split

23:08.082 --> 23:10.867
the crystal at the mid-point,
and separate the souls.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.435
We'll put George's back
into her body while Odette's

23:13.479 --> 23:15.742
will remain in her
half of the crystal.Okay.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.352
Okay.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.503
[exhales]

23:53.344 --> 23:55.521
Now to return George's soul
back into her body.

23:57.218 --> 24:00.482
Soul once lost
has now been found,

24:00.526 --> 24:03.267
no longer tangled
in the web of the void.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.053
We now return you, soul,

24:06.096 --> 24:08.708
to your rightful place.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.410
[gasps][gasping] George!

24:15.454 --> 24:17.847
Was that...

24:17.891 --> 24:20.415
What?

24:20.459 --> 24:22.939
Why is the light
back in the crystal?I-I don't know. It...

24:22.983 --> 24:26.029
it's not working. No.

24:33.559 --> 24:34.908
GEORGE: Hey, it's George.
Leave a short message.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.649
[beep]Hey, uh, so, I sent

24:36.692 --> 24:39.608
pics of the lock Nancy was
asking about to the group.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.523
I'm just checking
that you got them.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.657
And, um...

24:44.700 --> 24:47.486
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.751
But we can talk later.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.105
Are you sure
that you did it right?

24:58.148 --> 25:00.368
No. Obviously,
I'm not sure.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.762
I've never actually done
a soul exorcism before.

25:02.805 --> 25:05.329
Besides, the ritual was meant

25:05.373 --> 25:07.331
for the original type
of soul-splitter,

25:07.375 --> 25:09.551
not Beckett Dow's
specialty version.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.858
Did you say Beckett Dow?Yeah, he's the metalsmith

25:11.901 --> 25:13.773
that made this device
in the Civil War.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.036
His initials are
on the soul-splitter.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.568
B.D.-- Beckett Dow.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.396
Oh, my God, yeah.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.006
He-he must've been the locksmith

25:30.050 --> 25:31.921
that made the lock
for the underground cage.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.880
There were some things down in
the cage I didn't get a chance

25:33.923 --> 25:35.534
to look through, so maybe
there's something aboutGreat.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.231
the soul-splitter in there?Yeah, yeah.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.798
It's choking me.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.713
It's not choking you.
You just don't like it.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.584
I had to wear one
for my Bar Mitzvah.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.151
I hated it, too,
but you look great.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.719
You don't need a tie, bro.You definitely need a tie.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.982
You need to convince
this judge to delay

25:49.025 --> 25:51.071
the storage locker search
until tomorrow.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.508
We'll put the soul-splitter
back later tonight.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.250
Okay.JUDGE: Mr. Drew, we're waiting.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.252
Okay, let's go, let's go.

25:58.295 --> 25:59.949
Come on, come on.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.516
Here.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.345
Now, put this in here.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.608
Leave that on.Okay.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.568
Shoulders back,
chin up, enunciate.

26:20.274 --> 26:22.842
JUDGE:All right, Counselor.
You're seeking

26:22.885 --> 26:25.235
an injunction of the
evidence collection?

26:25.279 --> 26:27.150
Where's Jean?

26:27.194 --> 26:29.370
I mean,
D.A. Rosario.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.851
Where's...
Wasn't she supposed to be here?

26:31.894 --> 26:34.549
Mr. Drew,
A.D.A. Francouer

26:34.593 --> 26:36.507
is perfectly capable
of representing

26:36.551 --> 26:38.553
the D.A.'s office
at this hearing.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.903
Your Honor, speaking for the
D.A.'s office, we will obviously

26:40.947 --> 26:42.644
provide Mr. Drew with
any and all evidence

26:42.688 --> 26:45.647
pertaining to his client.Well...

26:45.691 --> 26:47.388
Uh...Yes, Mr. Drew?

26:48.868 --> 26:51.827
Well, the...
the thing is,

26:51.871 --> 26:54.351
my client-- Asher...

26:54.395 --> 26:56.353
JUDGE:
Let's begin again, please.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.704
Coherently this time.

26:58.747 --> 27:01.315
Damn. I should've given
him pointers on this, too.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.199
â™ª

27:21.030 --> 27:23.511
Oh...

27:25.861 --> 27:28.603
God, no cell service
in this cell.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.694
[phone vibrates]Oh.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.391
Nancy?

27:34.435 --> 27:36.132
[distorted]: Bess?

27:36.176 --> 27:37.568
Oh, God, I can barely hear you.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.396
Yeah, there's not a lot
of signal in the tunnels.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.703
Listen, I found
a set of notes in the cage.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.966
Beckett Dow's soul-splitter
was designed

27:44.010 --> 27:46.534
to split one soul
into multiple pieces.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.405
It was not designed
to disentangle

27:48.449 --> 27:50.973
two souls from each other.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.801
Okay, so how do we fix this?

27:52.845 --> 27:54.585
Well, in order
to complete the ritual,

27:54.629 --> 27:56.152
only George's soul
can be present.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.546
That means we need to destroy
the other crystal.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.983
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Destroy?

28:01.027 --> 28:02.724
No, no, no, Odette is in here.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.813
Maybe "destroy" meant
something else back then?

28:04.857 --> 28:06.510
"Destroy" means "destroy."

28:06.554 --> 28:07.860
This is the only way
to get George's soul

28:07.903 --> 28:08.861
back into her body.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.123
No, no, listen, it can't be

28:10.166 --> 28:11.559
the only way.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.517
What if-what if we keep them
both here?

28:13.561 --> 28:15.868
George gets her body back,
and Odette finds a new one.

28:15.911 --> 28:18.348
Odette finds a new body?

28:18.392 --> 28:21.090
Has that been your plan
this entire time?

28:21.134 --> 28:23.702
My plan? No.
It was not my plan, it just...

28:23.745 --> 28:26.052
It's just after talking
to Father Shane, it was an idea

28:26.095 --> 28:27.967
that became
a hope that became...

28:28.010 --> 28:29.098
Odette is dead, Bess.

28:29.142 --> 28:30.752
She's been dead
for a long time.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.058
And it may not be fair,

28:32.101 --> 28:33.799
but she should have
moved on to peace.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.583
And it's my fault she hasn't.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.541
And it's my fault that we're
in this mess to begin with.

28:37.585 --> 28:40.893
So we have to finish the ritual
and save George.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.198
Bess?

28:43.243 --> 28:44.635
Damn it.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.605
FRANCOEUR: Your Honor,
if Mr. Drew cannot produce

28:57.648 --> 29:00.608
a single piece of documentation,
then how does he expect you

29:00.651 --> 29:01.957
to consider his request?

29:02.001 --> 29:04.438
Dude, Carson is
tanking in there.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.788
Maybe he can
pull it together.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.747
The elixir's got
to wear off soon, right?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.618
You feeling any different?

29:10.661 --> 29:12.794
Hey, Ryan.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.970
Hey! Wait!

29:15.014 --> 29:17.538
Excuse me,
you can't go in there.Uh, pardon me, Your Honor,

29:17.581 --> 29:19.670
I'm Ryan Hudson.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.542
I got this.You're in the wrong place.

29:21.585 --> 29:23.762
Lawyer guy,
I wasn't talking to you.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.068
And I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.330
Hi.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.376
Oh, sorry.
[clears throat]

29:29.419 --> 29:32.118
Mr. Hudson,
this is a closed session.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.381
Unless you have business
in this chamber...

29:34.424 --> 29:37.253
I do, actually,
because one of the items

29:37.297 --> 29:39.603
in the storage unit
belongs to the Hudson family.

29:39.647 --> 29:42.693
To be clear, you are also
involved in this dispute?

29:42.737 --> 29:44.957
Yep. I mean, correct...

29:45.000 --> 29:48.874
a-amundo, as-as they say
in the original Latin.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.963
Counselor,
were you aware of this?

29:51.006 --> 29:53.052
Not until just now.That is also correct...

29:53.095 --> 29:55.837
a-amundo.Mr. Drew, it appears
you're acting

29:55.881 --> 29:57.752
as Mr. Hudson's attorney

29:57.796 --> 30:00.276
in addition
to your client Mr. Davies?

30:00.320 --> 30:02.452
Right.If this client

30:02.496 --> 30:04.193
also has standing in the case,

30:04.237 --> 30:05.760
then you realize I cannot
hold this hearing today.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.197
This is a time-sensitive matter.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.156
It's a storage unit.
It's not going anywhere.

30:10.199 --> 30:13.202
Mr. Hudson needs
to file paperwork

30:13.246 --> 30:15.814
and cite his interest
before we can proceed.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.033
Adjourned.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.777
Hey, G.G.,
Mr. Boring Lawyer Man.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.997
That was awesome.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.651
[exhales]

30:34.615 --> 30:36.617
You found me.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.796
Where are you and Odette headed?

30:43.493 --> 30:45.974
You must think
I'm a terrible friend.

30:46.018 --> 30:48.063
No. Anything but.

30:48.107 --> 30:51.197
It's just that when you said
I had to destroy Odette,

30:51.240 --> 30:53.503
I... I panicked.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.549
You know, I didn't
think I was gonna have

30:55.592 --> 30:57.725
to say goodbye today.I know.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.858
I'm sorry I pushed you earlier.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.252
I was so worried
about saving George,

31:03.296 --> 31:05.689
I didn't stop to think
what Odette means to you.

31:08.214 --> 31:10.520
So what now?

31:11.957 --> 31:14.133
I don't know.

31:14.176 --> 31:16.048
I'm lost.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.354
I'm so lost.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.269
And I'm a...

31:20.313 --> 31:22.750
coward.I disagree.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.492
I mean, forming
deep attachments

31:25.535 --> 31:27.450
takes a lot of courage.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.757
Yeah, I am, I'm attached.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.585
I admit it.

31:31.628 --> 31:34.414
'Cause even when Odette was deep
inside George's subconscious,

31:34.457 --> 31:37.547
I knew she was...
still there, somehow.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.029
Could there not be a way

31:41.073 --> 31:43.423
to keep Odette with
me, so that maybe

31:43.466 --> 31:46.208
one day, she could live the
life that she was meant to?

31:46.252 --> 31:47.949
A-A life that we could
live together?

31:47.993 --> 31:49.342
You don't want to say goodbye.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.387
No.I get it.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.520
After my mom died...

31:55.826 --> 31:59.352
...there were moments where I
could've sworn she was visiting.

31:59.395 --> 32:02.355
You know, she was leaving me
little signs.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.879
At least, that's how I took it.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.663
You know, my favorite movie
would come on TV

32:06.707 --> 32:09.144
or some song would play
on the radio

32:09.188 --> 32:11.320
or someone I cared about

32:11.364 --> 32:13.888
would call me out of the blue.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.414
And I liked to think that...

32:18.458 --> 32:20.851
that she was trying
to tell me that it was okay

32:20.895 --> 32:22.766
for me to feel happiness again.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.855
It's different.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.075
Is it? 'Cause Odette

32:27.119 --> 32:29.599
wants you to be happy.

32:29.643 --> 32:32.385
And she wants
George to live a full life.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.909
And none of that can happen

32:34.953 --> 32:37.129
if you don't help Odette

32:37.172 --> 32:39.044
move on to peace.

32:39.087 --> 32:42.134
How do we know that peace
is where they're going?

32:44.049 --> 32:46.660
Do you ever have doubts?

32:47.704 --> 32:49.619
NANCY:
No.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.491
After everything
that I have seen...

32:52.753 --> 32:55.234
...I don't doubt anymore.

32:58.628 --> 33:01.109
[sniffles]

33:01.153 --> 33:03.242
I just always feel

33:03.285 --> 33:05.287
like I'm saying goodbye.

33:10.249 --> 33:13.208
Goodbye doesn't mean
you're gonna be alone.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.084
[sobbing]

33:23.349 --> 33:25.960
George?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.744
Oh, my God, George!
Oh, my God.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.746
How are you feeling?

33:31.096 --> 33:33.533
Like myself again.

33:35.926 --> 33:38.712
Hey, thank you.

33:40.496 --> 33:43.369
â™ª In the end

33:43.412 --> 33:47.068
â™ª Who will fall?

33:51.942 --> 33:55.381
Hey Mom, it's me. Finished
the kugel, it was really good.

33:55.424 --> 33:58.079
Perfect noodle to raisin ratio.
Also, I just

33:58.123 --> 34:01.430
wanted to say sorry
that my choices have been...

34:01.474 --> 34:03.954
questionable lately.

34:05.739 --> 34:08.481
And also sorry for all the times
that I missed curfew,

34:08.524 --> 34:11.440
and I... I didn't listen, and...

34:11.484 --> 34:13.790
also sorry for the time
that I lost the car keys

34:13.834 --> 34:15.836
in the supermarket parking lot.

34:17.707 --> 34:20.710
Okay, uh, I love you.
I'll see you Friday.

34:20.754 --> 34:23.104
If you're looking for more
whipped cream, the answer's no.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.801
That was the last can.Oh, no, no, God, no.

34:24.845 --> 34:26.368
I don't want
any more of that stuff.

34:26.412 --> 34:27.543
[exhales]

34:27.587 --> 34:29.763
I don't know what came over me.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.678
You don't crave whipped cream?

34:31.721 --> 34:33.810
No.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.901
Mr. D, you're back!Hey, guys,

34:37.945 --> 34:39.990
guys, guys, please,
can you stop talking?

34:40.034 --> 34:42.210
My head is killing...

34:42.254 --> 34:44.125
Ow! Why do I feel like...

34:44.169 --> 34:45.779
I have whiplash.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.998
Do you guys remember anything?

34:49.522 --> 34:51.089
Oh, no. Jean.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.655
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.267
The way I see it,
you got two options.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.399
You can pretend
like it never happened.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.532
You can hopethat she

34:59.575 --> 35:01.142
never mentions it.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.491
Or you can own it,

35:02.535 --> 35:04.232
and, uh...Yeah, no.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.234
I got to go see her.
I got to go.

35:06.278 --> 35:08.715
Um, can you, uh...

35:08.758 --> 35:10.543
can you get
Ryan home?

35:10.586 --> 35:12.675
Yeah, no problem.

35:15.069 --> 35:18.768
I promise your story
will not be forgotten.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.857
[sniffling]

35:20.901 --> 35:23.251
The world will know

35:23.295 --> 35:25.601
about the life
of Odette Lamar.

35:29.257 --> 35:31.085
[chuckles]

35:31.129 --> 35:34.132
Nancy says this is where
the lilacs bloom in the spring.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.134
Your favorite.

35:47.057 --> 35:49.059
You okay?

35:50.235 --> 35:52.280
No.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.804
I completely
lost it back there.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.329
I don't know
what I was thinking,

35:57.372 --> 35:59.766
running away like that.

35:59.809 --> 36:02.203
George is gonna kill me

36:02.247 --> 36:04.771
when she finds out
what I did.

36:07.904 --> 36:10.516
I think that the only thing
George needs to know...

36:12.387 --> 36:14.389
...is that you
saved her life.

36:17.044 --> 36:19.394
Yeah?

36:19.438 --> 36:21.440
[knocking]Okay.

36:23.137 --> 36:25.357
I'll, uh, I'll
be right back.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.707
That's probably just
our phantom knocker again.

36:27.750 --> 36:30.231
[laughs softly]

36:35.149 --> 36:38.021
Odette, please, give me a sign.

36:39.893 --> 36:42.678
Let me know you made it
to peace.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.594
[gate creaks open]

36:45.638 --> 36:47.596
Let me know I did
the right thing.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.077
Hey.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.253
Hey!

36:52.297 --> 36:53.602
What are you doing here?

36:53.646 --> 36:55.691
I was just dropping off
Mr. Drew's jacket.

36:55.735 --> 36:57.476
He left it at the Youth Center.

36:57.519 --> 36:59.304
I didn't know you were here.Yeah.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.610
Here I am.NANCY: Uh,

37:01.654 --> 37:03.786
I'm just gonna
give you two a minute.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.006
Thanks.

37:06.049 --> 37:07.921
[whispers]:
Thanks, Odette.

37:07.964 --> 37:09.270
What?

37:11.272 --> 37:13.274
Look, I'm...

37:13.318 --> 37:16.016
I'm really sorry
about earlier today.

37:16.059 --> 37:19.498
I... I fully intended
to take you on a second date.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.630
But then your ex
came back into town and...

37:21.674 --> 37:23.241
Look, I get it, okay?

37:23.284 --> 37:24.764
No.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.461
No, you don't.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.768
There was someone,
but we've both moved on.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.683
So I'm asking you now

37:30.726 --> 37:32.206
if I can take
you to dinner.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.903
A proper date.

37:33.947 --> 37:36.254
A meal, with conversation.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.691
And perhaps dessert.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.694
Just take things slow.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.304
Actual conversation.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.306
And I get
to pick the restaurant.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.569
Okay? Nothing fancy.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.006
I'm in.

37:51.225 --> 37:54.054
[knocks]

37:56.317 --> 37:58.145
Hi.

37:58.188 --> 37:59.973
Hi.

38:00.016 --> 38:02.628
Looks like
you're feeling better.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.412
I am. Much better,

38:04.456 --> 38:06.458
actually.Good.

38:06.501 --> 38:09.112
I want to apologize for
coming by like that earlier.

38:09.156 --> 38:11.419
I wasn't myself.

38:11.463 --> 38:13.073
Or, at least...

38:13.116 --> 38:15.641
not my best self.

38:15.684 --> 38:18.252
Apology accepted.

38:19.688 --> 38:22.256
It seemed like you had
something pretty important

38:22.300 --> 38:23.649
to tell me.

38:23.692 --> 38:24.911
Actually, I did.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.088
The truth is...

38:29.437 --> 38:31.700
I like you, Jean.

38:31.744 --> 38:33.963
I think you're
incredible and smart

38:34.007 --> 38:36.183
and... beautiful.

38:36.226 --> 38:39.012
And being around you,

38:39.055 --> 38:42.015
frankly, makes me feel like
I'm a kid again.

38:42.058 --> 38:43.756
Oh.But if you don't

38:43.799 --> 38:45.410
feel the same way,

38:45.453 --> 38:48.021
then that will
not at all...

38:48.064 --> 38:49.588
impact our working
relationship.

38:49.631 --> 38:52.504
Your professional and
your personal integrity

38:52.547 --> 38:54.332
has always been
above reproach,

38:54.375 --> 38:55.811
and mine will be, too.

38:58.031 --> 39:00.642
What you, uh,
just said

39:00.686 --> 39:03.166
now, and-and...
[chuckles]

39:03.210 --> 39:04.907
what you said earlier...

39:06.822 --> 39:09.608
It's really refreshing to
have a grown man be so honest

39:09.651 --> 39:12.045
about how he feels.

39:12.088 --> 39:14.961
You-you were being honest,

39:15.004 --> 39:17.180
just to clarify?I was.

39:17.224 --> 39:20.662
And... and... I am.

39:20.706 --> 39:23.796
Well, then based
on what you said earlier,

39:23.839 --> 39:26.451
uh, that would mean that
right now your heart is racing?

39:26.494 --> 39:29.279
Yes. That's correct.

39:30.846 --> 39:33.196
And therefore isn't it true

39:33.240 --> 39:35.111
that there was something

39:35.155 --> 39:37.113
you were wondering about?

39:37.157 --> 39:39.551
Also correct.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.466
Is it possible
you were wondering

39:41.509 --> 39:43.250
what this would be like?

39:43.293 --> 39:45.557
â™ª

40:01.921 --> 40:03.705
I'm not sure

40:03.749 --> 40:06.534
what the return policy is on
that thing, but we could try.

40:06.578 --> 40:08.449
You know what?

40:08.493 --> 40:09.842
I think I might keep it.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.800
Yeah,
it sounds funny, but...

40:11.844 --> 40:13.802
I always used
to tell Lucy that I wanted

40:13.846 --> 40:15.804
to play guitar someday, but...

40:15.848 --> 40:17.545
my parents wouldn't let me, so,

40:17.589 --> 40:19.808
I guess now's my chance.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.506
Right on.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.116
I don't know,
it's like,

40:23.159 --> 40:25.597
spending time with Nancy...

40:25.640 --> 40:27.120
rubs off on you.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.122
She's so passionate
about everything.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.865
Makes you want to be
a better person, I guess.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.432
You know what I mean?

40:34.475 --> 40:36.434
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

40:37.826 --> 40:41.656
George.
Well, don't you look different.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.267
Very refreshed.Like I could live forever.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.660
Welcome back.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.706
Aw!

40:50.360 --> 40:52.624
Here, sit.

40:54.974 --> 40:57.150
Bess...

40:57.193 --> 40:58.934
I know you had
to let go of Odette.

40:58.978 --> 41:00.719
I'm really, really sorry.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.285
It's okay.

41:02.329 --> 41:05.158
She... she's at peace now.

41:05.201 --> 41:07.290
And, hey, you're okay.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.075
So that's all
that matters.

41:09.118 --> 41:10.903
Thank you.

41:10.946 --> 41:12.557
Hey, here's a question.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.210
What are you gonna do
with the rest of your life?

41:15.995 --> 41:18.388
The rest of my life.
[chuckles softly]

41:18.432 --> 41:20.390
I-I don't know.

41:20.434 --> 41:23.219
I-I don't know.
Everything?

41:23.263 --> 41:25.091
It's just the only thing
I can think about right now

41:25.134 --> 41:26.571
is how I can't wait
to tell Nick.

41:26.614 --> 41:28.442
Well, Ace is on his way
to pick him up now.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.662
Which means he will
be here any minute.

41:30.705 --> 41:33.055
[both chuckle]

41:33.099 --> 41:35.318
I tried calling him earlier,
but I got his voice mail, so...

41:35.362 --> 41:37.538
I don't know.
Let me try him again.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.758
[line ringing]

41:39.801 --> 41:41.673
ACE:
Hey, George.

41:41.716 --> 41:44.414
Ace? Why are you
answering Nick's phone?

41:44.458 --> 41:46.155
Are you guys on the way?
Put him on.

41:46.199 --> 41:47.505
I can't.

41:47.548 --> 41:49.376
Just got to his place.

41:49.419 --> 41:51.160
His phone's here,
but I didn't see

41:51.204 --> 41:52.727
his truck outside.
There's no note,

41:52.771 --> 41:54.686
no nothing.

41:54.729 --> 41:56.426
Nick's gone.
