WEBVTT

02:25.478 --> 02:26.896
Shh...

02:27.605 --> 02:28.606
It's okay, baby.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.150
It's okay.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.943
It was just a nightmare.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.987
I was awake.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.947
She was there.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.534
She screamed so loud
it hurt my ears.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.911
-Maybe it was Theo playing a joke.
-No.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.538
-It wasn't Theo.
-Okay.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.207
It was...

02:47.167 --> 02:48.126
like...

02:48.877 --> 02:51.087
a bent-neck lady.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.674
Well, that's a new one.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.301
-She's gone now, right?

02:56.634 --> 02:57.468
Yeah.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.596
If she comes back...

03:00.180 --> 03:01.931
you come find us, okay?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.017
Yeah, and we'll scare her away.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.685
Promise?

03:06.644 --> 03:08.021
Just tonight.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.607
Won't you miss your brother?

03:12.150 --> 03:13.735
I'd rather sleep here.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.030
In case she comes back.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.453
Okay, just tonight, then.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.332
-I'll stay with her a bit.
-Okay.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.126
Good night.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.131
-Young ladies.
-Good night.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.219
-Hey, will you grab her blanket?
-Yeah.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.345
Thanks.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.517
You feeling a little better?

03:47.894 --> 03:50.021
Tell me what's inside your locket.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.774
You know what's inside my locket.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.068
-I am.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.152
You are.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.780
Both of you are.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.198
Right?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.660
Can I have a locket like that someday?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.954
You can hold onto it tonight,

04:06.037 --> 04:08.373
and when you're older,
I'll give you this one.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.250
That exact one?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.960
This exact one.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.544
When you're older.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.505
Okay?

05:55.396 --> 05:58.691
No, no, no, no.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.401
I'm frozen.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.278
I can't talk.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.323
Or move my arms or legs.

06:06.908 --> 06:10.411
I usually start to panic
and my breath gets fast and heavy.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.456
My heart feels like it's pounding
out of my chest.

06:15.083 --> 06:15.917
Okay...

06:16.084 --> 06:17.627
and how long does this last?

06:18.002 --> 06:19.670
Until you're able to move again?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.631
Maybe a minute, maybe two.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.967
But it feels like hours sometimes.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.473
And you said the first occurrence
happened...

06:30.556 --> 06:31.599
When I was six.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.936
Do you ever see anything
during these episodes?

06:36.187 --> 06:37.063
Like what?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.024
People sometimes say
they see things.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.236
I know this all must sound really weird.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.237
Not at all.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.323
Sleep paralysis is actually
more common than you think,

06:47.407 --> 06:49.409
but it's completely harmless.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.620
Which is easy for
the sleep tech to say, right?

06:55.164 --> 06:56.916
Ah... and so...

06:57.375 --> 07:00.628
you've never sought treatment
or done any other sleep studies?

07:00.711 --> 07:01.546
No.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.005
I Googled it. I...

07:03.798 --> 07:06.259
I was surprised to find that
there was something to be done.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.260
Okay.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.514
So, during the night,
you... you cycle

07:11.722 --> 07:13.349
through different stages of sleep.

07:14.016 --> 07:18.062
In the deepest stage, your brain
basically switches off the muscles to

07:18.146 --> 07:20.022
stop you fromÂ acting out
your dreams.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.568
Some people just come out of that stage
quicker than others.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.737
Your brain wakes up before it starts
the engines again.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.324
It just takes a minute
for your muscles to catch up.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.743
Mm-hm...

07:34.120 --> 07:35.872
About the things I sometimes see...

07:36.706 --> 07:38.416
It's funny, the things people...

07:39.000 --> 07:41.127
sometimes report. Shadow people.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.420
Animals.

07:42.795 --> 07:43.838
Dead loved ones.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.507
Hallucinations are actually
fairly common

07:46.591 --> 07:48.968
because of the
disrupted boundary between

07:49.302 --> 07:52.013
your dream state and your wakefulness.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.932
So your dreams may carry over.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.101
"A little spill."

07:58.144 --> 07:59.103
What's that?

08:02.106 --> 08:02.940
So...

08:03.983 --> 08:05.109
what now...

08:05.401 --> 08:06.235
Dr. Vance?

08:06.527 --> 08:07.612
Oh, I'm not a doctor,

08:07.695 --> 08:09.030
I'm just a sleep tech.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.032
Oh.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.035
Okay, um... Well then, what now,

08:14.118 --> 08:16.245
Mr. Sleep Technician?

08:16.454 --> 08:18.331
-Tech... Technologist.
-Technologist.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.248
Yeah.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.626
Just... Just call me Arthur.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.503
So what now, Arthur?

08:25.087 --> 08:28.591
Well, first,
we'll schedule you for a sleep test,

08:28.674 --> 08:32.386
where we chart your brain waves,
heartbeat, and breathing while you sleep,

08:32.470 --> 08:35.681
then we'll use that information
to develop a kind of escape plan.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.891
An escape plan?

08:36.974 --> 08:39.769
A series of actions you'll be able
to recall during these episodes

08:39.852 --> 08:41.187
to help you get through them.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.982
It won't stop the process,
but it could get rid of the panic.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.026
You okay?

08:48.986 --> 08:49.987
Yeah, I...

08:51.906 --> 08:54.909
The last doctor I saw,
my general practitioner,

08:55.409 --> 08:58.246
he wasn't an expert.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.707
He just told me to avoid TV
before bedtime.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.251
It's...

09:03.334 --> 09:05.211
It's nice to be listened to.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.463
Do you drink coffee?

09:09.715 --> 09:10.675
Yeah, I...

09:12.051 --> 09:12.927
Are...

09:13.594 --> 09:16.180
Are you asking me if I want to get coffee?

09:16.430 --> 09:18.432
Uh, it's for the...

09:18.683 --> 09:20.309
health history section in your file.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.519
Oh.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.479
I'm sorry.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.898
-No, don't be.
-No, I really misread that.

09:25.982 --> 09:30.027
I was planning on waiting until the end
of your visit to ask you out for coffee.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.572
But since you brought it up...

09:33.322 --> 09:35.324
Yeah. -Okay.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.941
Ever had a better offer
in your whole life?

10:09.650 --> 10:10.985
One with everything?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.446
Ten!

10:14.113 --> 10:15.114
Nine!

10:15.239 --> 10:16.073
Eight!

10:16.324 --> 10:17.283
Seven!

10:17.700 --> 10:19.577
Six! Five!

10:19.952 --> 10:21.662
Four! Three!

10:21.996 --> 10:24.123
Two! One!

10:24.582 --> 10:26.083
Happy New Year!

10:58.407 --> 10:59.283
Yes!

11:29.438 --> 11:30.272
Hey.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.650
You haven't had one of these
in a while.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.487
Hey.

11:36.904 --> 11:37.780
You got it.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.491
Remember the plan.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.450
All right?

11:42.159 --> 11:43.953
Control your breath.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.872
Uh-huh.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.583
Now clench your fist.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.713
Uh-huh.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.798
And I'll get the light.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.550
Okay? Right here.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.053
Uh-huh.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.683
There you go.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.232
Clench your fist.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.317
Good.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.824
Huh? Yeah.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.161
-You did it.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.392
-Watch. Any second now.
-Okay.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.820
It's taking her forever.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.364
No, any second. Penny's gonna drop.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.619
There it is.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.709
Ten minutes.
It took her almost ten minutes.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.378
Ten minutes and 30 years.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.800
-Hey, did you close on the house yet?
-Next week.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.053
Arthur doesn't start his UCLA job
till June,

14:06.136 --> 14:08.389
so we'll have lots of time
to spend with you guys.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.723
-Great.
-Yeah.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.476
Luke said he might move out there too.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.980
He's following you west, huh?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.356
Yeah, it's a twin thing.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.987
I wouldn't get my hopes too high.
I mean...

14:23.320 --> 14:25.406
Who knows
if he'll be in any condition to?

14:27.199 --> 14:28.242
I hope he does.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.287
I wish he was here today.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.331
You're gonna love LA.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.791
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.419
You can go skiing and surfing
on the same day.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.087
-Why?
-I don't know.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.756
I don't know why you'd want to do that,
but you can.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.177
And you'll never have to scrape ice
off your windshield ever again.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.387
That's so nice.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.514
-It's very nice.

14:50.598 --> 14:51.765
It's the best.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.613
What are you looking at?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.031
Nothing.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.158
Nobody.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.661
-Too much champagne maybe.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.332
You deserve this, Nellie.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.291
Thank you.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.127
I mean, Eleanor Vance.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.587
-Oh, yeah.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.590
I'm gonna have to get used to that,
but I like it.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.175
It's perfect.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.631
Whoa.

16:07.549 --> 16:08.717
It's been a long time.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.470
Honey...

16:11.887 --> 16:12.721
Hey.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.181
Shh.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.350
Relax.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.568
I'll get the light.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.636
No!

17:37.306 --> 17:38.515
No.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.103
Arthur!

17:44.688 --> 17:45.773
He was dead.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.275
He was dead and she was back.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.653
How long had it been?

17:51.987 --> 17:53.822
Since you'd seen her, I mean?

17:55.365 --> 17:56.867
It'd been almost two years.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.535
I actually hadn't...

17:59.912 --> 18:01.080
seen her since...

18:04.917 --> 18:06.460
well, since Arthur and I met.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.588
I started seeing her...

18:10.297 --> 18:11.548
when I was a kid.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.427
And after the house when we lived
with my aunt, I saw her some more.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.806
But then he came into my life
and she went away.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.519
And then she killed him.

18:24.603 --> 18:28.190
We've talked about this before.
Arthur died of an aneurysm.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.274
I know.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.069
Well, if you know, then you must also know
that it was a...

18:32.319 --> 18:33.612
a random tragic event.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.489
I know it looked like an aneurysm.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.325
It's perfectly normal to want to find
something to blame.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.952
I know what's to blame.

18:40.702 --> 18:41.829
Hill House.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.372
Hill House.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.542
That's right.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.961
Don't worry, Dr. Montague.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.381
I don't expect you to believe me.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.472
Your hair is awful tangled, Mr. Bristles.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.143
Maybe I could find a brush for you.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.419
Mrs. Dudley, look what I found.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.547
My goodness.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.049
What a lovely tea set.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.509
Can I keep it?

19:38.218 --> 19:39.261
Well, let's see.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.971
Where did you find this?

19:41.054 --> 19:42.347
In the toy room.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.473
Where?

19:44.224 --> 19:45.392
Look at this one.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.352
Stars.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.730
A cup of stars.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.273
Well, I'll be.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.026
It's beautiful.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.528
You know...

19:57.196 --> 20:00.991
I think I know who
this may have belonged to.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.494
Jacqueline.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.663
Jacqueline's cup of stars.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.415
Here she is.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.751
-Jacqueline?
-Jacqueline Hill.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.462
Her mom owned this house,
Mrs. Hill.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.674
This was her room, actually.
Hazel. Her name was Hazel.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.093
That's her when she was young.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.512
-Did you know her?
-I did.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.640
I took care of her when she was old.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.225
She lived in that bed.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.353
She said a lot of things toward the end
that didn't make sense.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.856
One of the things she kept saying was
that Jacqueline needed her cup of stars.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.317
I didn't understand then,
but I guess I do now.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.361
So, can I keep it?

20:38.111 --> 20:40.572
Yes, I'm sure it's fine
that you keep the tea set.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.866
As long as your parents agree.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.244
I'm only going to drink out of this one.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.870
For anything.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.540
For juice, or milk,
or anything Mommy has.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.793
Unless Mommy says no.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.462
I broke a mug once.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.173
I'm not supposed to have things
that are fragile.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.300
And this looks fragile.

21:00.842 --> 21:01.760
No, dear.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.929
Use your cup of stars.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.640
Insist on your cup of stars.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.643
Once they've trapped you into
being like everyone else,

21:09.726 --> 21:11.603
you'll never see your cup of stars again.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.857
But you should wash it first.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.150
It's very dusty.

21:24.950 --> 21:25.784
Nellie.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.119
Mommy...

21:27.703 --> 21:28.954
look what I found.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.290
-Can we have a tea party?
-Not now.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.127
-Young lady.
-Please, oh please, oh please?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.378
No.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.463
Come with me, right now.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.677
We have a very, very important job.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.139
And that's to take care of this house.

21:47.806 --> 21:48.849
To fix it.

21:50.183 --> 21:53.353
We take care of the house,
it takes care of us.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.857
-So why would you do that?
-I... I didn't.

21:57.107 --> 22:00.610
-I saw you playing with chalk yesterday.
-On the patio.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.529
I wouldn't write on the wall.

22:03.530 --> 22:04.364
What happened?

22:04.448 --> 22:06.325
Would you like to tell your sister
what you did?

22:06.408 --> 22:07.576
I didn't!

22:07.659 --> 22:08.952
She says she didn't.

22:13.790 --> 22:14.875
Are you okay?

22:15.042 --> 22:15.917
No.

22:16.918 --> 22:20.255
I have a steel poker in my head
and my daughters

22:20.339 --> 22:21.548
are trashing my...

22:24.009 --> 22:25.010
You know what?

22:25.886 --> 22:27.679
You can help her clean up, Theo.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.598
And I expect it to be done

22:30.015 --> 22:31.141
before I get back.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.272
Well, she's in a mood.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.733
I didn't do it.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.568
I swear.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.132
No.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.426
You didn't.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.678
You can tell?

23:10.013 --> 23:11.181
With your hand?

23:17.104 --> 23:18.605
I don't see why it matters.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.566
They're pulling down
this wallpaper anyway.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.238
-Hey.
-Hey. Thanks for picking me up.

24:08.321 --> 24:09.531
How you doing?

24:09.614 --> 24:12.409
-I'm good. So we're going to...
-It's on Seventh.

24:12.492 --> 24:15.120
-Just go like you're going to the stadium.
-Okay.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.880
I'm proud of you.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.549
Yeah. I'm a real winner.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.010
-Is this a good place?
-Oh, yeah.

24:30.093 --> 24:32.762
It's a palace. Turn left here.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.639
A summer camp for junkies.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.558
I'm proud of you.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.145
Doesn't matter where you do it.
What matters is you want to change.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.397
It's always gonna make me proud of you.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.274
How are you?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.610
-Me?
-Yeah.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.445
How you doing?

24:48.987 --> 24:50.113
I'm good.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.448
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.952
Yeah, it's been really hard
ever since Arthur, you know.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.998
I've been having a hard time sleeping
in that house without him, so...

25:00.081 --> 25:01.917
Well, yeah. I mean...

25:02.167 --> 25:03.710
Yeah, it's just been--

25:03.793 --> 25:06.588
Can you take a right
and pull over, please?

25:13.512 --> 25:16.848
I, uh... I just need one more favor.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.309
-Why are we--
-See that guy?

25:20.310 --> 25:22.229
The guy in the white hat over there?

25:23.813 --> 25:24.648
Yeah.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.107
See...

25:27.943 --> 25:29.277
Okay, so here it is.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.781
I need to get well before I go in.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.158
I'm not sure I understand.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.953
It helps, you know, you...
you get well...

25:39.246 --> 25:40.330
one last time.

25:40.872 --> 25:44.751
You get to kind of go through the gates
and kind of get it out of your system,

25:44.834 --> 25:48.004
you know, and... and get well
one last time.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.465
And it helps, it's really helpful.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.008
Okay.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.303
You know, I was gonna have you stop here

25:55.387 --> 25:58.515
and I was gonna hop out
and take care of it, but...

25:58.765 --> 26:01.601
But you see that guy in the white hat?

26:01.685 --> 26:03.812
See, I owe that guy,

26:03.895 --> 26:07.440
and if he sees me coming
and I don't have enough money,

26:07.524 --> 26:08.483
he's...

26:10.026 --> 26:11.403
He's just not gonna sell to me.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.656
But... he doesn't know you.

26:15.949 --> 26:18.243
-So...
-So you want me to--

26:18.326 --> 26:21.079
-Nellie, it's a little--
-You want me to buy you heroin?

26:21.162 --> 26:24.124
-It's... Don't say it like--
-And then drop you off at rehab?

26:24.207 --> 26:26.459
It's a little thing, Nellie.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.254
And I'll pay you back
as soon as I get out.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.173
And it's going to take, I promise you.

26:33.049 --> 26:36.136
Look, I'm tired of this shit.
Okay? I'm done.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.138
I'm gonna do it this time.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.264
All right?

26:39.347 --> 26:41.641
Look, I can bullshit Steve and Shirl

26:41.725 --> 26:43.768
and Theo if I gotta, but not...

26:44.060 --> 26:45.312
not you, Nellie.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.063
Never you.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.567
Look at me.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.947
It's just you and me.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.867
That's it. This is it.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.785
I'm... I'm gonna do it. I just...

27:03.204 --> 27:05.332
I just... I just need to get...

27:06.082 --> 27:08.501
I just need to get well one last time,
just to...

27:09.085 --> 27:12.589
just to push me through the gates
and then that's it. That's it.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.466
You believe me, right?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.052
I believed you.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.388
I always, always believed you.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.223
When we were kids and then...

27:22.390 --> 27:24.059
and later when you saw...

27:24.184 --> 27:26.269
when you said you saw...
I believed you.

27:27.854 --> 27:28.730
Believe me now.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.863
How much is it gonna cost?

27:36.946 --> 27:37.864
Twenty bucks.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.741
One balloon. That's all you need.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.078
You know, I always believed in you,
you know that?

27:43.662 --> 27:45.538
And I get it.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.958
I've been having a really hard time too,
and nobody wants to see it--

27:49.042 --> 27:51.670
Look, I wanna see it. Okay?
I wanna see it.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.089
I get it. So...

27:54.297 --> 27:56.341
you help me get well...

27:57.550 --> 27:59.552
and then you can tell me all about it.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.554
Okay?

28:03.807 --> 28:05.016
-Okay.
-Okay?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.434
Okay.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.352
Yeah.

28:12.649 --> 28:13.608
I'll be right back.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.871
Fuck. Fuck.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.270
-Thanks.
-He just spit that out of his mouth.

28:50.353 --> 28:51.896
Yeah, that's what they do.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.181
You still collecting those buttons?

29:29.976 --> 29:30.810
Huh?

29:31.227 --> 29:33.688
I'll see if I can find some for you
at the center.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.199
Sorry.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.660
We all just need a little help
sometimes, right, Nellie?

29:49.662 --> 29:50.663
Nellie.

29:52.373 --> 29:53.333
Nellie.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.723
I saw my brother last month.

30:09.641 --> 30:13.228
A bed opened up in a center downtown
and he needed someone to drive him.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.064
And did you?

30:17.774 --> 30:18.608
I did.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.361
Last month?

30:22.070 --> 30:22.904
That's right.

30:24.656 --> 30:28.076
Is there any particular reason
that you didn't mention this

30:28.159 --> 30:30.662
at any of our other sessions since then?

30:33.456 --> 30:34.749
How's he been doing?

30:36.084 --> 30:37.043
Good, actually.

30:37.585 --> 30:38.419
You've...

30:38.670 --> 30:40.088
you've spoken to him again?

30:41.381 --> 30:42.215
No.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.926
The first few days he was there,

30:45.009 --> 30:47.011
I felt like I had
the worst flu of my life.

30:48.721 --> 30:50.765
Day four, I started to feel better.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.435
And I haven't had any phantom pains
or anything like that.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.315
You probably don't believe
in the twin thing, do you?

30:59.399 --> 31:03.361
I believe a unique shared empathy
exists between twins, sure.

31:04.070 --> 31:04.904
Well...

31:06.114 --> 31:09.993
my shared empathy made me feel
nauseous for the first few days,

31:10.076 --> 31:10.952
but then...

31:11.411 --> 31:12.662
I guess he got better.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.957
How is this new medication
working for you?

31:16.249 --> 31:17.876
Any... issues?

31:18.918 --> 31:19.752
None.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.212
It's great.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.340
Are you sure?

31:26.509 --> 31:28.011
What kind of question is that?

31:28.094 --> 31:30.763
I mean, this event seems to have
really upset you.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.975
Is there more to this story?

31:35.518 --> 31:37.645
He needed my help and I helped him,
and...

31:38.479 --> 31:39.355
that's all.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.357
Wait, you did what?

31:41.441 --> 31:42.942
He needed to get well.

31:44.819 --> 31:48.948
I wish you would have called me.
That is not the way you help an addict.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.746
It was a little thing
and he's fine.

31:54.996 --> 31:55.914
Can we drop it?

32:00.001 --> 32:01.169
So are we heading out?

32:01.419 --> 32:04.172
-I'm really excited to see the beach--
-Not yet.

32:05.798 --> 32:06.883
Could you just...

32:08.509 --> 32:09.469
You said you would.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.763
-Please, you know I don't like--
-You said you would.

32:20.688 --> 32:21.522
Where?

32:22.106 --> 32:22.941
The pillow.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.695
-Which one?
-That one.

32:41.834 --> 32:42.710
Anything?

32:46.089 --> 32:46.965
No.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.301
I'm sorry.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.515
Here.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.269
Theo.

33:02.063 --> 33:02.981
Okay, okay.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.658
It's where he died.

33:19.455 --> 33:20.873
Nellie, I don't want to...

33:21.499 --> 33:23.126
-You said you would.
-Hey! Hey!

33:23.209 --> 33:24.752
The fuck! Nellie!

33:25.670 --> 33:28.047
Anything

33:28.256 --> 33:30.466
You really can't feel anything?
I mean, I feel like

33:30.550 --> 33:32.135
I can feel him here sometimes.

33:32.218 --> 33:36.347
I am feeling serious fucking concern.
That is what I am feeling.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.767
-I just want to know if he's still here.
-He's not.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.562
And that fucking sucks.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.189
And I know that.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.692
And I'm sorry, but you can't...

33:49.736 --> 33:51.279
You can't live like this.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.867
Jesus, when was the last time you cleaned?

33:56.993 --> 33:58.745
I came out here to see my sister.

33:58.828 --> 34:01.039
I thought we would go to a museum,
go to the beach,

34:01.122 --> 34:02.832
I thought we might get drunk
and fucking cry,

34:02.915 --> 34:04.917
but I didn't think I'd be
treated like a servant.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.044
I'm sorry!

34:06.711 --> 34:08.921
What is this new doctor
doing for you, anyway?

34:09.005 --> 34:09.839
I'm sorry.

34:09.922 --> 34:12.341
You look worse now than you did
four months ago.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.511
-Has this new quack got you on new meds?
-He's not a quack.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.847
Well, he's not exactly impressing me,

34:17.930 --> 34:20.058
and I know what the fuck
I'm talking about.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.142
Oh my God.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.813
Honestly, Nell, I wish you would consider
just moving back east.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.232
-You are here all by yourself.
-I have Steven.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.817
When he's not on a book tour.

34:30.401 --> 34:31.235
And...

34:31.319 --> 34:33.654
I have to be here for Luke, you know,
when he gets out.

34:33.738 --> 34:36.199
-So he has a place to crash after a binge?
-He's in rehab.

34:36.282 --> 34:39.744
He made you buy him heroin
on the way in.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.791
Does Shirley know what he made you do?

34:47.668 --> 34:49.796
Like you're above taking money
from family?

34:50.421 --> 34:52.673
You want to talk about what
Shirley knows and doesn't know?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.092
What does that mean?

34:54.175 --> 34:55.343
I guess that's a no.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.596
She might not let you freeload anymore.

34:59.555 --> 35:00.598
Nellie.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.350
I've got your back...

35:02.892 --> 35:05.103
-but I also have my limits.
-Only with us.

35:05.978 --> 35:07.313
Yeah, never with yourself.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.401
You've never cared about anyone
more than yourself,

35:12.860 --> 35:13.945
and that's sad.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.073
But don't lecture me
about adulthood, Theo,

35:17.156 --> 35:19.450
not from Shirley's fucking guest house.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.682
It was fascinating.

35:43.266 --> 35:46.269
Prisoners, rangers, visitors.

35:47.103 --> 35:50.731
They had so many stories to tell,
more than I could fit in the book.

35:52.233 --> 35:55.444
Whispering in cells,
locked cell doors shutting,

35:55.778 --> 35:56.863
phantom figures.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.367
Even the sounds of musical instruments
and sewing machines.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.704
I wish I could have included it all.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.039
Any other questions?

36:07.707 --> 36:08.583
Yeah.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.836
Have you or your siblings been back
to Hill House since '92?

36:12.545 --> 36:14.964
Look, I'm thrilled you guys came out
for the reading today,

36:15.047 --> 36:17.175
but I'm really here
to talk about Alcatraz.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.092
Yes.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.261
Do you keep in touch with your father?

36:20.595 --> 36:23.764
Again, I'm not going to answer questions
about my family.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.852
So does anyone else have
another question...

36:28.394 --> 36:29.937
not related to Hill House?

36:31.606 --> 36:32.607
I have a question.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.486
Oh my God. That's Nell Crain.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.113
I have a question, Steve.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.908
Nell. I didn't know you...

36:42.283 --> 36:43.492
I'm so glad you're here.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.411
Why do you keep lying to these people?

36:47.330 --> 36:48.164
What?

36:48.247 --> 36:51.876
I'm saying, why did you charge
these people $30 a head

36:52.293 --> 36:55.796
to sit here and listen to you talk about
things that you don't believe.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.424
Nellie, we can talk about this
after the reading.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.383
No.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.636
I'd like you to answer me now.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.971
Look, everybody, I'm sorry about this.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.599
My family is just like any other family.

37:06.682 --> 37:09.393
-We don't always agree on everything.
-We're not, though.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.480
Like any other family.

37:13.689 --> 37:14.649
We're different.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.776
Because of where we grew up.

37:17.610 --> 37:22.031
Now, you stand there and you talk
about ghosts and spirits.

37:23.115 --> 37:27.245
And you sell tickets for the privilege,
and yet you don't believe in any of it.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.538
-Nell--
-And you tell me I'm crazy,

37:29.622 --> 37:33.084
and that Mom was crazy
and Luke's crazy

37:33.167 --> 37:34.502
and we're all just nuts,

37:34.585 --> 37:36.254
and then you tell our stories.

37:36.879 --> 37:39.548
My stories, the same stories
that you told me

37:39.632 --> 37:41.968
were just dreams or delusions.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.511
We can talk about this later--

37:43.594 --> 37:45.554
And you're supposed to be my big brother.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.183
You know, you're supposed to protect me.

37:50.351 --> 37:54.522
But you say the meanest things to me
when I try to tell you.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.024
And then you make

37:57.483 --> 37:59.735
so much money.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.862
-Nell.
-I'm just asking why.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.286
I don't ask you for anything, ever.

38:09.912 --> 38:10.830
Just this.

38:13.165 --> 38:14.917
I just want to know why.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.463
What the fuck, Nell?

38:19.547 --> 38:20.840
It was a fair question.

38:21.507 --> 38:22.842
This is my work.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.511
This place, think of it as my office.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.305
I'm at work right now.

38:27.638 --> 38:30.182
You don't come in here
and embarrass me like that.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.600
-Me embarrass you?
-Jesus.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.311
Have you read
what you wrote about us?

38:33.394 --> 38:35.563
You've had six years to file a complaint.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.523
Why the hell are you doing this now?

38:37.898 --> 38:38.733
Huh?

38:39.984 --> 38:41.902
-Are you off your meds?
-No.

38:42.903 --> 38:43.738
Bullshit.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.240
I've seen all the phases with you.

38:46.449 --> 38:49.035
The Christian phase, the New Age phase,

38:49.118 --> 38:52.455
the crystal phase,
the antidepressant phase.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.582
You don't get to just start
smashing up our lives

38:54.665 --> 38:57.418
because you're transitioning
into a new treatment, Nell.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.548
This was not the time or place.

39:03.549 --> 39:04.842
Not the time or place.

39:07.386 --> 39:08.721
I confronted my brother.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.931
Just like you told me to.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.518
I'm not so sure I used
that word "confront."

39:14.602 --> 39:16.020
I drove to Ojai

39:16.312 --> 39:17.563
and I called him out,

39:17.938 --> 39:19.774
in front of all of his little fans.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.734
You should have seen his face.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.819
Do you think that was constructive?

39:26.989 --> 39:27.948
It felt good.

39:31.619 --> 39:32.703
I'm going to...

39:34.497 --> 39:35.956
I'm going to ask you something

39:36.040 --> 39:39.460
-and I need you to be honest with me.
-Yes, I'm taking my meds.

39:40.961 --> 39:42.630
And I'm standing up for myself.

39:43.672 --> 39:44.882
For the first time.

39:47.093 --> 39:47.927
In ever.

39:48.010 --> 39:50.471
You're certain you're taking
your medications?

39:53.599 --> 39:57.186
Because, you know, this was never
about confronting Steven

39:57.269 --> 39:58.437
or your other siblings.

39:59.105 --> 40:02.149
The problem is that you haven't
confronted your past.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.069
Every time we talk about

40:05.486 --> 40:07.405
your mother or your childhood...

40:07.822 --> 40:10.324
or your symptoms or Arthur...

40:10.699 --> 40:13.119
it always comes back to one thing.

40:13.911 --> 40:14.870
The house.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.164
There's an excellent reason for that.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.167
How can a house, just a collection of

40:20.251 --> 40:22.294
bricks, wood, and glass...

40:23.504 --> 40:25.297
have that much power over people?

40:27.049 --> 40:28.801
You've never been there.

40:28.884 --> 40:29.927
Well, that's true.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.848
But see, neither have you,
not for a long, long time.

40:33.931 --> 40:37.726
And I think that if you were to look
at it today after all these years,

40:37.810 --> 40:41.313
empty in the woods,
you'd find it's not a monster.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.315
It's barely even a house.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.401
It's a carcass.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.445
I mean, no one's lived there in...

40:47.570 --> 40:49.321
what, 26 years, you said?

40:49.613 --> 40:50.823
It's just a building.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.616
Probably littered with...

40:53.492 --> 40:55.244
with graffiti and dirt.

40:57.204 --> 40:59.331
-I...
-What would Arthur say to you

41:00.124 --> 41:01.959
if he could talk to you right now?

41:03.294 --> 41:06.088
What do you think he'd want
for the rest of your life?

42:45.604 --> 42:46.939
What are we doing here?

42:48.315 --> 42:49.817
Are we going back for Mom?

42:50.901 --> 42:51.735
Not yet.

42:59.743 --> 43:00.619
Come in.

43:07.418 --> 43:08.752
Why did we leave Mommy?

43:09.795 --> 43:10.713
It's okay.

43:11.547 --> 43:12.590
Everything's okay.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.467
I just need you guys to camp out here
for a little while.

43:16.510 --> 43:17.428
I have to...

43:18.012 --> 43:20.848
I have to go back to the house
and get Mommy.

43:21.557 --> 43:22.516
You're leaving?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.268
I'll be right back. I promise.

43:24.852 --> 43:27.104
Stevie, I need you to be in charge, okay?

43:27.813 --> 43:29.690
-What's wrong with Mommy?
-She looked hurt.

43:29.773 --> 43:30.608
When?

43:30.691 --> 43:32.151
I'll bring her back,

43:32.234 --> 43:33.694
but I have to go now.

43:34.820 --> 43:37.740
Now, I need you guys to take care
of each other right now.

43:37.823 --> 43:38.991
Can you do that for me?

43:41.785 --> 43:43.329
Come here.

43:46.123 --> 43:47.041
Okay.

43:47.833 --> 43:48.667
Okay.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.632
You lock this door behind me.

44:00.387 --> 44:01.764
What the hell is happening?

44:02.056 --> 44:02.890
I don't know.

44:02.973 --> 44:05.100
You were the last one out.
What'd you see?

44:05.643 --> 44:07.811
Dad woke me up, carried me out.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.563
-I'm not sure what I--
-Theo.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.023
Did you see anything?

44:13.776 --> 44:15.319
I don't know what I saw.

44:15.861 --> 44:18.364
What did you mean,
Mommy looked hurt?

44:18.906 --> 44:20.449
She fell on the floor.

44:20.532 --> 44:21.408
Where?

44:22.701 --> 44:24.203
We were in the Red Room.

44:25.079 --> 44:25.913
What?

44:26.080 --> 44:28.832
We were in the Red Room
having a tea party

44:28.916 --> 44:30.751
with Abigail and Mommy.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.503
How? The Red Room's locked.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.465
That wasn't Mommy.

44:49.561 --> 44:50.604
Mm.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.353
One, two,

45:31.895 --> 45:33.856
three, four,

45:34.106 --> 45:35.816
five, six,

45:36.108 --> 45:36.984
seven.

47:18.710 --> 47:19.586
Come on.

47:23.340 --> 47:24.758
Did you find Mommy?

47:30.389 --> 47:31.348
I found her.

47:34.977 --> 47:36.270
Is she okay?

47:38.397 --> 47:39.481
She's okay now.

47:48.782 --> 47:49.867
It's just paint.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.872
You should get some sleep.
You've had a rough night.

47:55.205 --> 47:56.999
I was waiting for you.

47:57.666 --> 47:59.751
I didn't know if you'd come back.

48:16.018 --> 48:17.895
It's okay, honey. I called them.

48:20.522 --> 48:21.481
Why?

48:24.484 --> 48:25.903
Give me a second, sweetie.

48:38.123 --> 48:39.666
Thank you. I'll just be a moment.

48:41.084 --> 48:42.336
What's going on?

48:43.003 --> 48:45.631
I have to go with them now
and answer some questions,

48:46.214 --> 48:48.800
but one of them is going to stay here
with you guys

48:48.884 --> 48:50.844
-until your Aunt Janet gets here.
-What?

48:50.928 --> 48:52.554
-She'll be here a little later.
-Later?

48:52.638 --> 48:54.181
How long is later?

48:54.264 --> 48:56.099
-It won't be that long.
-No.

48:56.183 --> 48:59.895
You said you'd be right back before,
and it was the longest time.

48:59.978 --> 49:02.564
Your Aunt Janet's
flight gets in at...

49:02.898 --> 49:05.651
She should be here no later
than two o'clock.

49:06.568 --> 49:07.653
See, so...

49:08.403 --> 49:10.864
when a little hand's
on the two and...

49:11.782 --> 49:13.241
the big hand's on the 12...

49:14.117 --> 49:15.535
she should be here, okay?

49:17.204 --> 49:18.246
Two o'clock.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.417
You hold onto this,

49:23.168 --> 49:24.419
and I'll try to...

49:25.629 --> 49:27.631
I'll try to be back here soon as I can.
Okay?

49:29.424 --> 49:31.093
Okay, Daddy.

49:43.021 --> 49:43.981
Ready.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.400
Thank you.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.340
Holy shit.

50:24.980 --> 50:29.067
How are your brother and sisters doing,
I wondered, since the book?

50:29.192 --> 50:31.028
-How are they doing these days?

50:31.445 --> 50:35.115
You know who I wish would write a book?
Your dad.

50:41.413 --> 50:42.873
I'm sorry.

50:44.082 --> 50:44.916
So...

50:45.792 --> 50:48.253
Are you saying you'd prefer
not to do a viewing?

50:48.712 --> 50:50.130
It's Nell, um...

50:50.589 --> 50:51.757
I need you to call me.

50:53.300 --> 50:55.427
It's hard to understand,
everything's so...

50:56.303 --> 50:58.597
twisted and it's hard to explain,
but...

51:03.393 --> 51:04.561
I'm worried about Luke.

51:06.313 --> 51:07.481
Have you talked to him?

51:09.983 --> 51:10.817
Call me.

52:52.544 --> 52:54.504
It's Steve. Sorry I missed your call.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.507
I talked to Shirley.
I know you're worried about Luke,

52:57.591 --> 53:00.135
but I called his rehab center
and he's fine.

53:00.218 --> 53:03.430
He actually got his 90-day chip today,
if you can believe that.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.476
I'll be around tomorrow
if you still need to chat.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.980
I hope you're well, Nellie.

53:12.939 --> 53:13.899
I mean that.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.344
Okay... Okay.

53:44.596 --> 53:46.765
How long are you gonna
put this off, Nellie?

53:48.058 --> 53:49.559
Okay.

53:50.852 --> 53:51.728
Okay.

53:53.605 --> 53:55.732
You probably shouldn't have slept all day.

53:58.526 --> 54:00.612
There's nothing wrong
with going at night.

54:02.197 --> 54:03.907
It's just a carcass in the woods.

54:05.408 --> 54:07.577
It's just a carcass in the woods.

54:08.578 --> 54:09.996
It's just a carcass...

54:10.956 --> 54:12.165
in the woods.

56:00.190 --> 56:01.024
Nell?

56:02.192 --> 56:03.151
Daddy.

56:04.235 --> 56:06.279
Honey, are you okay

56:08.281 --> 56:10.158
Do you remember the Bent-Neck Lady?

56:16.164 --> 56:16.998
Yes.

56:18.291 --> 56:19.292
She's back.

56:20.585 --> 56:21.419
Okay.

56:22.712 --> 56:24.381
Nell, where are you?

56:25.256 --> 56:26.174
I'm at home.

56:27.509 --> 56:28.343
In bed.

56:28.718 --> 56:31.137
I want you to go to Steve and Leigh's.

56:31.638 --> 56:33.765
I'm... I'm gonna drive to Orlando...

56:34.516 --> 56:35.683
and get a flight to LA.

56:35.767 --> 56:38.019
You... Steve's closest,
so you go to him.

56:40.730 --> 56:43.441
Okay? And I'll see...
I'll see you there tomorrow.

56:45.151 --> 56:46.027
Okay.

56:48.113 --> 56:49.364
I love you, Daddy.

56:49.614 --> 56:50.907
Are you okay?

56:57.122 --> 56:58.790
I'm fine.

56:59.124 --> 57:00.500
I'm sorry to wake you.

57:02.210 --> 57:03.378
Good night, Daddy.
