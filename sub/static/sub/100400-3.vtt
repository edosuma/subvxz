00:03.735 --> 00:05.408
Where do you think they're going?

00:05.432 --> 00:08.576
Hong Kong, Istanbul.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.742
From Seattle?

00:11.090 --> 00:12.939
I don't know. Sacramento?

00:18.597 --> 00:21.219
It's getting late.
Can you... Can you stay over?

00:22.116 --> 00:23.629
Thought your dad said
I couldn't do that anymore.

00:23.653 --> 00:26.412
Ugh. He doesn't get to tell me
what to do.

00:26.436 --> 00:27.798
He kinda does.

00:27.822 --> 00:29.869
Um, no, excuse you.

00:29.893 --> 00:32.491
I'm 20, almost 21.

00:32.848 --> 00:35.640
Soon, it won't be a misdemeanor
when I have a beer.

00:35.664 --> 00:38.096
Well, I'm almost 21, too,

00:38.120 --> 00:41.448
and if you add us up, we're like 41...

00:41.472 --> 00:43.230
‭2?

00:44.001 --> 00:45.234
Old. ‭

00:51.426 --> 00:53.355
Come on, Ryan, wake up.

00:53.379 --> 00:54.571
Wake up. Stay with me.

00:54.595 --> 00:55.594
Ryan?

00:59.787 --> 01:02.087
Ryan, wake up. Stay with me.

01:02.946 --> 01:04.330
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:06.704 --> 01:08.280
- Come on, come on, come on!
- What happened?

01:08.304 --> 01:09.756
He's losing blood.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.187
He's losing blood fast.

01:16.253 --> 01:17.764
Ryan, come on.

02:10.723 --> 02:12.889
Are you okay?

02:25.138 --> 02:30.209
We're here to celebrate
the life of Ryan Michael Tanner,

02:30.233 --> 02:32.226
to honor his sacrifice.

02:32.250 --> 02:36.120
A police officer's job
can give us so much...

02:55.999 --> 02:58.279
It seems like most everyone here

02:58.303 --> 03:03.326
knew my nephew
as Ryan the police officer.

03:06.733 --> 03:09.750
But when I think of my nephew...

03:09.774 --> 03:13.165
that was just a small piece
of who he was.

03:13.189 --> 03:15.367
I think of the eight-year-old

03:15.391 --> 03:18.046
who would bring me breakfast in bed.

What is he, foreman now?

03:42.510 --> 03:43.734
Battalion Chief.

03:43.758 --> 03:45.299
Yeah, but he stays here?

03:45.323 --> 03:46.860
He's Battalion Chief.
He does what he wants.

03:47.351 --> 03:49.439
He oversees something like
five firehouses now.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.031
Including Station 23? Maybe
he can fix their shower problem.

03:52.055 --> 03:53.502
What's their shower problem?

03:53.526 --> 03:55.893
- They don't use them.
- ‭Hey!

03:56.319 --> 03:58.119
So, do we call him Chief now?

03:58.143 --> 03:59.815
- Uh, yep.
- ‭Okay.

03:59.839 --> 04:00.935
So, that gets confusing.

What do we call Dixon, "Chief Chief"?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.494
What's Andy doing here?

04:09.678 --> 04:11.638
Oh, Sullivan's about to name
a new Captain,

04:11.662 --> 04:13.196
and she's not gonna miss that.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.682
Is it everything you dreamed of?

04:16.706 --> 04:18.538
- I think you should take some time...
- I don't want time.

04:18.562 --> 04:19.923
I want to work. I need to work.

04:19.947 --> 04:21.992
You suffered a trauma. You lost a friend.

04:22.016 --> 04:24.139
I'm aware of what I've suffered
and what I've lost.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.241
I know what Ryan meant...
Can I work or not?

04:29.978 --> 04:32.121
Respectfully, Captain Sullivan...

04:32.145 --> 04:33.711
Battalion Chief.

04:35.578 --> 04:38.690
Chief Sullivan.

04:38.714 --> 04:40.706
I need to be at work.

04:40.730 --> 04:42.584
I'm saying...

04:43.158 --> 04:44.766
"please."

04:55.504 --> 04:56.473
You're here?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.560
Need to work.

04:57.584 --> 05:01.102
Actually tempted
to set a fire for us to fight.

05:01.510 --> 05:02.509
You approved of this?

05:02.533 --> 05:03.917
She says she needs
to be around her people.

05:03.941 --> 05:05.197
She buried her best friend yesterday.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.861
Sir, if she goes out on a call
before she's ready...

05:06.885 --> 05:08.413
Don't let her go on a call, then.

05:08.437 --> 05:09.725
You want to be a leader, start leading.

05:09.749 --> 05:11.069

What are you doing here? Is Andy okay?

05:56.114 --> 05:57.242
Andy's okay.

05:57.266 --> 05:59.676
Unfortunately, I am not.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.680
It was a long drive, son.
Invite me in for a drink.

06:05.015 --> 06:06.249
Yeah.

06:10.386 --> 06:13.009
Medical dispatch,
person down for Aid Car 19.

06:13.033 --> 06:14.472
I can take the call, if you want.

06:14.496 --> 06:15.678
Why would I want that?

06:15.702 --> 06:18.421
Because Aid Car sucks.
You could legit get peed on.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.620
I've had far worse bodily fluids on me.

06:20.644 --> 06:22.049
Just this week, in fact.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.940
You got something to say?

06:27.964 --> 06:30.427
You're not gonna cry on me, are you?

06:31.467 --> 06:32.970
No, but I might just puke
from the smell of you.

06:32.994 --> 06:34.656
- That cool?
- ‭

06:34.972 --> 06:37.892
Finally. Someone who'll fight back.

Hi.

06:45.452 --> 06:46.645
I'm not sure if you remember me,

06:46.669 --> 06:48.811
but you pleasured me in your truck,

06:49.179 --> 06:50.403
then ignored all my texts.

06:50.427 --> 06:52.100
What the hell are you doing here?

06:52.124 --> 06:53.220
I'm Rigo's wife.

06:53.244 --> 06:55.171
It's perfectly innocent
for me to drop by,

06:55.195 --> 06:56.163
meet his new unit.

06:56.187 --> 06:57.891
Ah... ‭

06:57.915 --> 06:59.107
Hey.

06:59.131 --> 07:01.219
I'm bored. Entertain me.

07:01.243 --> 07:05.120
You are married to a firefighter
who I work with.

07:05.144 --> 07:07.040
So? You don't even like him.

07:07.064 --> 07:08.704
- That... There's a code.
- ‭Oh...

07:08.728 --> 07:10.176
There's a brotherhood, okay?

07:10.200 --> 07:11.905
Oh, my husband is not your brother.

07:11.929 --> 07:13.889
My husband is not your friend.

07:13.913 --> 07:17.153
My husband is not here.

07:18.101 --> 07:19.892
W-Wait. Wait.

07:28.268 --> 07:30.217
- She's in the fitting room.
- In here!

07:30.241 --> 07:32.181
My daughter's in here! She's in here!

07:32.205 --> 07:33.801
How did she seem when she collapsed?

07:33.825 --> 07:35.356
She seemed fine.

07:35.380 --> 07:38.355
She just got dizzy, she fell,
and she hit her head.

07:38.379 --> 07:40.810
Any pre-existing conditions?
Any medication?

07:40.834 --> 07:43.200
No, she's healthy. She's...
She's only 30 years old.

07:43.645 --> 07:44.764
Any history of fainting?

07:44.788 --> 07:46.996
I haven't been in her life for a while.

07:47.020 --> 07:49.611
Oh, s-she passed out once
in fourth-grade choir practice.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.641
Does this store have
a carbon monoxide detector?

07:53.288 --> 07:54.608
Uh, in the showroom.

07:54.632 --> 07:55.920
I'll get it.

07:58.138 --> 07:59.938
Ma'am, I'm with
the Seattle Fire Department.

07:59.962 --> 08:01.985
Can you tell me your name
and where you are?

08:02.009 --> 08:03.201
My name is Shauna...

08:03.225 --> 08:05.473
Oh, crap. Am I bleeding on this dress?

08:05.497 --> 08:06.625
Maybe we could take it off?

08:06.649 --> 08:08.322
Is she okay to take the dress off now?

08:09.691 --> 08:11.428
You have a carbon monoxide leak.

08:11.452 --> 08:12.996
You need to close the store.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.148
I-Is that flammable?

08:14.172 --> 08:15.556
Very. And toxic.

08:15.580 --> 08:18.650
Oh. Well, my whole inventory
is in this store.

08:18.674 --> 08:20.154
- I-I need time to move it all out.
- Come on.

08:20.178 --> 08:21.690
No. We gotta move now.

08:21.714 --> 08:24.602
I need you to open all windows,
unplug any appliances.

08:24.626 --> 08:26.970
Stay out of the building
until the gas company clears it.

08:26.994 --> 08:29.700
Uh, wait. You can't leave
with that dress.

08:29.724 --> 08:31.588
We don't have time for a costume change.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.700
It's a $10,000 dress.

08:33.724 --> 08:35.259
- $10,000? What the hell's it made of?
- $10,000?

08:35.283 --> 08:36.634
How many dresses do you think you'll sell

08:36.658 --> 08:38.010
after a customer dies in one?

08:38.034 --> 08:39.385
Or after I call the police on you

08:39.409 --> 08:40.953
for interfering with a patient's care?

08:40.977 --> 08:42.587
Or after you go to jail for manslaughter?

08:42.611 --> 08:44.410
- I...
- ‭Move!

08:47.277 --> 08:48.757
One of the biggest causes of death

08:48.781 --> 08:50.037
in pre-hospital medicine...

08:50.061 --> 08:52.469
With reflexes like that,
no wonder you quit surgery.

08:52.493 --> 08:53.627
Uh, yeah.

08:53.651 --> 08:54.710
Uh, you know, I kind of thought

08:54.734 --> 08:56.789
that we'd be talking
in your office, standing still.

08:56.813 --> 08:58.980
What, you can't walk
and chew gum at the same time?

09:00.429 --> 09:04.223
So, um, one of the most common
causes of death in the field

09:04.247 --> 09:06.495
is, uh, delay of treatment
due to transport.

09:06.519 --> 09:07.903
There's not much we can do about that,

09:07.927 --> 09:09.687
except open more ERs.

09:09.711 --> 09:11.893
Or we can bring the ER to the patient.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.395
- Like an ER on wheels.
- Actually, yes.

09:14.419 --> 09:16.053
A, uh... A Physician Response Team.

09:16.077 --> 09:20.244
Basically, it's like
a tricked-out ambulance

09:20.268 --> 09:22.579
staffed with MDs and ER supplies.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.276
Sounds expensive.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.004
Why don't I have your pick
for Captain of 19?

09:26.028 --> 09:27.027
Sir, I-I think that we...

09:27.051 --> 09:28.650
Pay attention, Doctor.
I changed the subject.

09:29.579 --> 09:31.860
I'll have my recommendation
to you by end of day.

09:31.884 --> 09:32.938
Good.

09:33.464 --> 09:34.944
I hope it's one of those girls you have.

09:34.968 --> 09:38.784
I've been getting pounded by
the Mayor to promote more women.

09:38.808 --> 09:40.118
We can pay them less.

09:41.144 --> 09:42.741
Kidding.

09:43.907 --> 09:45.442
City council meeting I got to get to.

09:45.466 --> 09:48.632
My least favorite part of
the job... all the schmoozing.

09:49.515 --> 09:50.794
Hey.

09:50.818 --> 09:52.961
Next time, we should play
basketball so you guys can win.

09:58.317 --> 10:00.554
You gonna let that go? ‭Eh...

10:00.974 --> 10:02.550
Let's assume it was a reference
to my height.

10:02.574 --> 10:05.462
A-A-And just so I'm clear,

10:05.486 --> 10:08.876
did he just flat out reject me
over ping pong?

10:10.542 --> 10:12.150
He did.

10:12.174 --> 10:13.228
Yeah.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.292
Hey, looking good, man,
pumping those guns!

10:20.316 --> 10:23.290
Whatever favor you need,
the answer is no.

10:23.314 --> 10:25.275
Actually, I'm here to do you a favor.

10:25.299 --> 10:27.461
I am setting you up on a date
with an amazing woman.

10:27.485 --> 10:30.313
The last woman you set me up
with stole my car...

10:30.337 --> 10:31.839
and my identity.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.659
I'm still getting
weird magazine subscriptions.

10:33.683 --> 10:35.232
All right, you remember Maggie Pierce,

10:35.256 --> 10:36.480
hottie heart surgeon at Grey Sloan?

10:36.504 --> 10:38.048
- She has a boyfriend.
- ‭Had.

10:38.072 --> 10:42.208
Her boyfriend is...
now kinda my boyfriend.

10:42.232 --> 10:44.022
Avery was Maggie's boyfriend?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.150
Whatever. It's weird.
We're moving through it.

10:46.174 --> 10:48.735
- Come to this party with me.
- At the hospital?

10:48.759 --> 10:51.263
No, but there will be a lot of
doctors there. It's at their house.

10:51.287 --> 10:53.202
- Whose house?
- Jackson and Maggie's parents' house.

10:53.226 --> 10:54.569
- Their parents...?
- ‭Are married to each other.

10:54.593 --> 10:56.049
Jackson and Maggie have the same parents?

10:56.073 --> 11:00.042
No. Okay, Jackson's mom is married
to Maggie's biological father,

11:00.066 --> 11:01.738
who she didn't know
until pretty recently.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.722
But whatever, man. There's no relation.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.930
And I r... I really... I really
need you to focus, Miller.

11:05.954 --> 11:07.498
Just... ‭Nah.

11:07.522 --> 11:08.923
Come on! It's a party.

11:08.947 --> 11:11.921
Free booze. Finger foods. Pretty doctor.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.033
I see what you're doing here.

11:15.057 --> 11:16.185
I may be hot

11:16.209 --> 11:20.487
and... ooh... my muscles, they're large,

11:20.511 --> 11:22.490
and I kind of look like
a cartoon character.

11:22.514 --> 11:24.618
- ‭Yeah.
- But I'm not entirely an idiot.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.050
And I'm not gonna be your buffer.

11:27.074 --> 11:30.378
So keep your weird
family date dinner thing

11:30.402 --> 11:31.962
to yourself.

11:31.986 --> 11:33.882
Miller. Miller, Miller, Miller,
Miller, Miller...

11:33.906 --> 11:34.960
Hard nah.

11:41.682 --> 11:44.763
Mmm. Mmm, nice work, sir.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.068
I applaud your efforts.

11:47.092 --> 11:49.243
‭Efforts?

11:49.267 --> 11:50.865
Uh, accomplishments.

11:51.186 --> 11:52.624
I'm no longer bored.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.530
Is he bad to you?

11:59.034 --> 12:00.088
Rigo?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.591
You can tell me. I can...

12:02.615 --> 12:04.457
I can try to help.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.694
"Is he bad to you, little lady?

12:09.718 --> 12:12.414
Come and hop on my horse,
and we'll ride into the sunset."

12:12.438 --> 12:14.061
- I'm serious.
- ‭

12:14.317 --> 12:16.372
No.

12:16.396 --> 12:18.570
He's great to me. I married a great guy.

12:19.118 --> 12:22.166
I just don't understand
what's happening here.

12:23.598 --> 12:26.925
Oh, the pretty ones
always need their hands held.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.701
How are we doing, Shauna?

12:32.725 --> 12:34.110
A lot better, thanks.

12:34.134 --> 12:35.814
Look, anything you need?

12:35.838 --> 12:38.413
Water? Snack? I mean, I can run
and get you anything you need.

12:38.437 --> 12:39.756
Yeah, actually, could you run out

12:39.780 --> 12:41.197
and get me my happy childhood back?

12:41.221 --> 12:42.573
Whoa! Okay.

12:42.597 --> 12:44.749
He cheated on my mom.
It was 20 years ago.

12:44.773 --> 12:47.826
And then basically disappeared
for the rest of my life.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.010
I'm here now.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.398
Okay, and all this resentment,
it can't be healthy.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.774
I really don't think it's up to you

12:52.798 --> 12:54.278
to tell your daughter how to feel.

12:54.302 --> 12:55.750
Thank you.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.586
It's a date. You like dates.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.186
It's a party. You like parties.

12:59.210 --> 13:00.693
I'll be there. You like me.

13:00.717 --> 13:03.186
And I'll make jokes. You like jokes.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.658
They're all surgeons.
You're a firefighter.

13:04.682 --> 13:06.130
They're all Gucci.
You're a sturdy gym bag.

13:06.154 --> 13:07.601
You think they're gonna look down on you,

13:07.625 --> 13:08.872
and you're not wrong.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.915
I wasn't... I wasn't
thinking that, actually.

13:11.939 --> 13:14.113
But now I am, so thanks for that.

13:16.387 --> 13:19.282
Dude, you smell like sex!

13:20.299 --> 13:21.843
No, I worked out. I worked out.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.763
You smell like you worked out
while having sex.

13:24.715 --> 13:26.442
Were my instructions unclear?

13:26.987 --> 13:27.950
Hmm?

13:27.974 --> 13:29.518
Because I could have sworn I said

13:29.542 --> 13:31.023
I wanted Herrera to stay in the house.

13:31.047 --> 13:33.092
- I tried to swap with...
- Not good enough.

13:33.459 --> 13:36.016
When I give an order,
I expect it to be followed.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.026
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

13:41.843 --> 13:43.067
I don't get how you do it.

13:43.091 --> 13:44.379
How I do what, exactly?

13:44.403 --> 13:46.331
How you treat your friends
like chess pieces,

13:46.355 --> 13:47.963
moving us around so you can win.

13:47.987 --> 13:49.627
You're mean when you're brokenhearted.

13:49.651 --> 13:52.582
You sent Andy out there,
hoping she would fail.

13:52.606 --> 13:53.766
You played on her grief.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.613
Andy is a grown woman.
She makes her own choices.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.658
I mean, I'm with Sullivan.

13:59.682 --> 14:01.887
I don't understand how Andy's
even functioning right now.

14:04.615 --> 14:05.956
I'll check her vitals.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.917
Vasquez, tell dispatch we need
a truck and engine response

14:10.941 --> 14:12.891
to this location now.

14:12.915 --> 14:14.171
For a CO leak?

14:14.195 --> 14:16.091
No, for smoke pouring out of a manhole.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.775
Ohh!

14:34.263 --> 14:39.313
Reported smoke from
manhole for Ladder 19, Engine 19.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.073
112 Stevens Street.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.897
Channel 7 dispatch.

14:42.921 --> 14:44.131
Bishop!

14:44.155 --> 14:45.767
Aid 19 on scene requesting.

14:47.145 --> 14:49.201
That was Herrera, um, calling for backup.

14:49.225 --> 14:51.377
You're in charge.

14:51.401 --> 14:53.383
- Don't blow it!
- ‭Yes, sir!

14:58.390 --> 15:01.567
Everyone needs to clear
this area now... right now.

15:01.591 --> 15:04.661
Sewer explosions, CO leak.
Power lines must be corroding.

15:04.994 --> 15:08.050
Every breaker panel on this
block could short out.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.170
We got to clear out, Herrera.

15:09.194 --> 15:10.738
Don't panic. Just keep moving.

15:10.762 --> 15:12.338
We need to evacuate the street.

15:12.362 --> 15:14.418
We have a patient. That means we go!

15:14.442 --> 15:16.946
Shauna is stable, and we're
standing on a powder keg.

15:16.970 --> 15:19.520
We save more lives
by clearing this area now.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.081
Where's my phone? I want to call Mom.

15:22.105 --> 15:23.105
Where's my purse?

15:24.281 --> 15:25.888
You must have left it in the store.

15:25.912 --> 15:27.360
Look, I-I'll go get it.

15:27.384 --> 15:28.413
No, you won't.

15:28.437 --> 15:29.538
No, Dad, I'll come back for it.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.989
I'm getting your purse, sweetie.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.867
Sir! You can't go back in that store!

15:33.457 --> 15:34.724
Herrera!

15:34.748 --> 15:35.723
I got him.

15:35.747 --> 15:37.491
He thinks that by calling me "sweetie"

15:37.515 --> 15:39.370
and throwing money
at my wedding, I'll forget

15:39.394 --> 15:41.152
that I didn't have a dad
for two-thirds of my life.

15:41.176 --> 15:42.238
Vasquez!

15:46.316 --> 15:47.531
Dad?

15:47.555 --> 15:48.931
Dad!

15:50.537 --> 15:53.352
Still can't believe this stuff is legal.

15:54.401 --> 15:56.136
I got three friends from high school

15:56.160 --> 15:59.455
who did serious time
for carrying an eighth.

16:00.096 --> 16:02.345
Does it help with the pain?

16:02.369 --> 16:03.657
Yeah.

16:03.681 --> 16:04.872
Some.

16:08.605 --> 16:10.596
Oh, no, no, no. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.844
Don't... Don't do that.

16:11.868 --> 16:14.721
I didn't come here to have you pity me.

16:14.745 --> 16:16.967
Oh, so you're telling me
you drove 20 hours

16:16.991 --> 16:19.528
to tell me about a cancer
you don't want to treat

16:19.552 --> 16:20.798
and not get pity?

16:22.080 --> 16:24.168
Oh.

16:25.952 --> 16:30.692
I just heard how stupid that sounds.

16:30.716 --> 16:34.372
I have cancer,
and I'm not gonna get chemo.

16:34.396 --> 16:37.060
That's... No more of these for you.

16:37.084 --> 16:41.114
I retire after 40 years of fire service,

16:41.712 --> 16:44.952
and I get not one,
but two types of cancer.

16:44.976 --> 16:47.318
‭And this one's in my balls.

16:50.395 --> 16:52.323
Cancer balls!

16:52.347 --> 16:54.211
It's not funny! ‭It's really not.

17:01.072 --> 17:02.093
Ohhh! Ohhh!

17:12.271 --> 17:14.575
Captain Herrera?

17:15.545 --> 17:17.089
I'm so sorry for your loss.

17:17.113 --> 17:19.896
It's... It's unthinkable.

17:22.862 --> 17:25.156
It was Andy's choice to be on duty today.

17:25.181 --> 17:26.902
I-I gave order for her
not to go out, and she...

17:26.925 --> 17:29.316
Ah, you couldn't
have stopped her with an army.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.469
I know my daughter.

17:30.493 --> 17:32.900
That's her. That's Andy right here.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.414
And that's Ryan.

17:35.438 --> 17:37.499
7 years old, maybe 8.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.611
He was a good kid.

17:39.635 --> 17:40.945
Had a rough start.

17:41.647 --> 17:44.088
His father wasn't a good role model,

17:44.112 --> 17:46.552
so I tried to step in.

17:46.576 --> 17:48.632
When they were younger,
I'd bring him here with Andrea.

17:48.656 --> 17:50.620
God, they were inseparable.

17:51.214 --> 17:52.950
Then later, when he got older,

17:52.974 --> 17:55.317
she'd try to sneak him into her bedroom,

17:55.341 --> 17:57.910
and, uh...

17:57.934 --> 17:59.765
That never went over very well.

18:05.482 --> 18:07.314
Oh. What was that?

18:07.338 --> 18:08.671
Hmm?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.728
What? What... What is happening?

18:12.752 --> 18:14.349
Oh!

18:14.834 --> 18:16.195
Dad! Dad?!

18:16.219 --> 18:18.148
I told you not to slam the door.
Oh, my God!

18:18.172 --> 18:20.035
Now the door comes off.

18:20.059 --> 18:21.028
Ohh!

18:25.940 --> 18:28.977
All right, folks, stop your
gawking and vacate the area.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.922
Martin, can you hear me?

18:30.946 --> 18:32.394
I need you to stay awake. Martin.

18:32.418 --> 18:34.442
This is Aid Car 19
to Grey Sloan Memorial.

18:34.466 --> 18:35.818
We've got a 50-year-old male

18:35.842 --> 18:37.546
with severe blunt trauma to the chest.

18:37.570 --> 18:39.147
Tell me he's gonna be okay.

18:39.171 --> 18:40.672
Okay, I got GCS 12.

18:41.193 --> 18:42.897
- Multiple rib fractures with flail chest.
- Dad, please! Come on.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.561
Desatting into the 80s.

18:44.585 --> 18:46.768
This can't be happening.
Today can't be our last day.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.793
I was so mean.

18:48.712 --> 18:49.680
I repeat, I repeat!

18:49.704 --> 18:51.303
Severe blunt trauma to the chest!

18:51.738 --> 18:53.474
Should we go? Can we go?
‭He stopped breathing.

18:53.498 --> 18:55.682
Let's go to the hospital!
Get an ET tube ready.

18:55.706 --> 18:56.770
Let's go to the hospital!

18:56.794 --> 18:58.142
Not until we secure his airway.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.571
I need you to stay back, Shauna.

19:01.478 --> 19:02.868
Come on, breathe.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.236
- He can't die.
- He can't die. He can't die.

19:05.260 --> 19:07.444
- Shauna... Shauna, I need you...
- He can't die. He can't die.

19:07.468 --> 19:09.002
- I really need you to stay back...
- You can't die, Dad!

19:09.294 --> 19:10.966
- You can't leave me again!
- ...and give us some space to work.

19:10.990 --> 19:12.406
- I need suction. I need suction.
- He can't, he can't.

19:12.430 --> 19:13.846
He wanted to walk me down the aisle.

19:13.870 --> 19:15.160
He just came back.

19:15.184 --> 19:16.465
He just said he's sorry.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.905
I need to forgive him!

19:17.929 --> 19:19.601
I-I need time to forgive him!

19:19.625 --> 19:21.164
All right, i-it's... It's been too long.

19:21.188 --> 19:22.416
- Bag him.
- ‭I can do it. Just let...

19:22.440 --> 19:23.601
No, I said bag him.

19:23.625 --> 19:25.104
Dad, please. Please, please.

19:25.128 --> 19:26.000
Come on, come on.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.838
I've got two patients.

19:28.862 --> 19:31.911
A mild carbon monoxide poisoning
and a severe blunt trauma.

19:31.935 --> 19:33.382
Needs an airway,
and we can't quite get it.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.471
Could use Warren.

19:34.495 --> 19:35.883
Warren, you and Montgomery

19:35.907 --> 19:37.259
swap out Herrera and Vasquez
on the Aid Car.

19:37.283 --> 19:38.443
What else?

19:38.467 --> 19:40.075
We've got corroding power lines
in the sewers,

19:40.099 --> 19:41.387
releasing carbon monoxide and smoke.

19:41.411 --> 19:43.290
The tiniest spark could ignite that gas.

19:43.314 --> 19:44.537
Every manhole cover on this block

19:44.561 --> 19:45.818
is a projectile waiting to happen.

19:45.842 --> 19:47.034
Call the city.
Tell them to kill the power.

19:47.058 --> 19:50.063
Hughes, Miller, hit that manhole
with extinguishers.

19:50.087 --> 19:52.496
No water... I repeat, no water...

19:52.520 --> 19:54.639
Until we are sure the electricity is off!

19:54.663 --> 19:56.296
You pulled me off Aid Car?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.184
Yeah. I don't know your skills.
I know theirs.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.200
Gibson and Vasquez, you're on evac duty.

20:00.224 --> 20:01.416
Clear the whole neighborhood.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.984
Dispatch, we're gonna need
additional units

20:03.008 --> 20:05.278
and SPD on scene ASAP.

20:06.191 --> 20:08.119
It's tough to visualize the cords.

20:08.143 --> 20:10.231
- Come on, come on.
- ‭

20:10.255 --> 20:12.086
Shauna, try to take
some deep breaths, okay?

20:12.110 --> 20:13.463
We're doing everything we can.

20:13.487 --> 20:14.518
I'm in.

20:22.127 --> 20:24.343
All right, seatbelts, everybody.
We're on the move.

20:24.367 --> 20:27.191
Is he breathing?
Did you... Did you save him?

20:29.011 --> 20:31.708
No. N-No, I need it done
faster than that.

20:31.732 --> 20:32.827
Come on, people. Keep moving.

20:32.851 --> 20:34.364
Come on. Keep going. Move, move.

20:34.388 --> 20:35.954
- Smoke. We got smoke!
- Move.

20:35.978 --> 20:37.618
Vasquez, what the hell are you doing?

20:37.642 --> 20:38.705
No, Vasquez, don't!

20:38.729 --> 20:40.507
Stand down!

20:40.531 --> 20:42.131
Hey!

20:42.155 --> 20:43.313
Don't! Stop!

20:44.243 --> 20:45.233
Stop!

20:46.387 --> 20:47.345
Stop!

20:59.664 --> 21:00.783
Dr. K.

21:02.065 --> 21:03.090
- Robert.
- ‭Hey.

21:03.114 --> 21:04.656
- You're back.
- ‭Yeah.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.872
Good thing I'm wearing this white coat.

21:05.896 --> 21:08.176
Otherwise, people would have
trouble telling us apart.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.824
So, this whole tall and handsome
in a uniform look work for you?

21:11.848 --> 21:14.576
Seems a little obvious to me,
a little, uh, textbook.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.071
Hmm? Yeah.

21:16.430 --> 21:17.558
I got more jokes.

21:17.582 --> 21:20.085
I can just keep going till
you tell me why you're here.

21:20.109 --> 21:21.302
Please don't.

21:21.326 --> 21:24.204
So, uh, the episodes are getting worse.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.070
My leg felt like it was on fire today.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.005
Because you have
Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.

21:29.029 --> 21:30.382
I told you it would likely get worse.

21:30.406 --> 21:31.629
I've been doing physical therapy.

21:31.653 --> 21:33.507
It's... It's been better.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.260
Thought it might be going away.

21:35.284 --> 21:37.276
Chronic conditions
don't tend to just go away.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.474
That's why we call them, uh, chronic.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.213
You always this condescending?

21:42.237 --> 21:44.825
Well, believe me, you want,
uh, an arrogant surgeon.

21:44.849 --> 21:47.065
You find a surgeon who plays it
humble, run the other way.

21:47.089 --> 21:49.784
- So, you ready to try surgery?
- ‭I don't know.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.128
I'll take that as a maybe.

21:51.152 --> 21:53.272
I'll need current images, an EMG, an MRI.

21:53.296 --> 21:55.075
I'll know more once I
compare them to the old ones.

21:55.099 --> 21:56.155
Is there a long wait?

21:56.179 --> 21:57.623
'Cause, technically,
I'm supposed to be at work.

21:57.647 --> 21:59.384
Well, you're in luck.
First responders skip the line.

21:59.408 --> 22:01.422
Here, I'll show you
the imaging department.

22:02.908 --> 22:04.177
Thanks, bro. That was close.

22:04.201 --> 22:05.550
What the hell were you thinking?

22:05.574 --> 22:06.895
Look, I was just trying to make sure

22:06.919 --> 22:08.590
that manhole cover
didn't pancake someone else.

22:08.614 --> 22:10.355
I told you to stop!

22:10.379 --> 22:11.539
I got there in time.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.694
All you did was introduce air
to the fire underneath us.

22:13.718 --> 22:14.878
Why do you think...

22:16.694 --> 22:19.134
It's the bridal shop!

22:19.158 --> 22:20.255
Is anyone in there?

22:20.279 --> 22:21.886
I told the owner to evac.

22:21.910 --> 22:24.062
I don't think you won her over
with your charm.

22:24.086 --> 22:25.588
We better sweep it.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.956
No, no, no. No. Not you.
You're staying here.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.076
What? Why?

22:29.100 --> 22:30.259
Because you're dangerous
and you don't listen.

22:30.283 --> 22:32.577
- I'm not staying...
- Hey, I outrank you.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.154
Hook up the hose line and get us water.

22:34.178 --> 22:35.200
I'm not a probie.

22:35.224 --> 22:36.568
Yeah, you are...
For the rest of this call.

22:40.775 --> 22:42.849
I'm sick over Tanner.
I can't imagine how you feel.

22:42.873 --> 22:44.033
I know the layout in there.

22:44.057 --> 22:45.546
You don't have to do this.

22:45.570 --> 22:47.969
Stop trying to protect me.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.198
His BP and heart rate are dropping.

22:53.222 --> 22:54.506
- Pushing a round of epi.
- Come on!

22:54.530 --> 22:55.556
No, no, no, no, no.
Why is that happening?

22:55.580 --> 22:56.619
Is he getting worse?

22:56.643 --> 22:58.145
He's bleeding inside his chest.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.643
He... He needs surgery.

23:00.667 --> 23:01.932
Can I... Can I hold his hand?

23:01.956 --> 23:03.148
That won't hurt him, will it?

23:03.172 --> 23:05.228
No. No, go ahead.

23:07.780 --> 23:10.050
Dad...

23:10.442 --> 23:12.723
I'm so sorry I couldn't forgive you.

23:12.747 --> 23:14.899
I'm so sorry I couldn't talk to you.

23:14.923 --> 23:16.722
I'm sorry I made you beg.

23:16.746 --> 23:18.565
Move it! Get out of the way!

23:18.589 --> 23:19.575
This isn't a parade!

23:19.599 --> 23:20.654
What's going on, Montgomery?

23:20.678 --> 23:22.341
"Lord of the Flies" out here.

23:22.365 --> 23:23.671
I want time to forgive you better.

23:23.695 --> 23:24.918
City power grid's down
because of the sewer fires.

23:24.942 --> 23:25.997
I need to find another route.

23:26.021 --> 23:27.589
I want time for you to forgive me better.

23:27.613 --> 23:28.699
Make it fast, Travis.

23:28.723 --> 23:30.385
I want you...

23:30.638 --> 23:33.078
...to read to me at bedtime again.

23:33.102 --> 23:34.358
I want you to...

23:34.382 --> 23:35.766
put Band-Aids on my cuts again.

23:37.595 --> 23:39.460
I want you to be my best friend again.

23:39.484 --> 23:40.932
He's got a cardiac tamponade.

23:40.956 --> 23:42.441
He needs surgery now!

23:42.465 --> 23:44.200
Aid Car 19 to Grey Sloan.

23:44.224 --> 23:46.120
Our ETA is delayed. Stand by.

23:46.144 --> 23:49.154
Dad, I'm so sorry. Please don't die.

23:54.682 --> 23:57.154
Sir, I need you
to stay still for me, please.

23:59.450 --> 24:00.802
Sir, are you okay?

24:00.826 --> 24:02.424
Do I look okay?

24:03.913 --> 24:06.290
I-I-I-I can't help you
unless I get these pictures.

24:07.689 --> 24:09.841
Okay, that's it. I'm getting you out.

24:12.522 --> 24:15.309
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wait. Wait.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.588
Don't take me out.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.281
Hey, I can call Dr. Koracick.

24:20.305 --> 24:22.137
We can get you a shot for the
pain, and then we can try again.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.119
Just wait!

24:24.177 --> 24:25.263
Wait.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.494
Come on, come on, come on.

24:29.776 --> 24:30.872
Is that all you got?

24:30.896 --> 24:32.152
Come on!

24:32.176 --> 24:33.304
Come on.

24:33.328 --> 24:34.872
I'm sorry, Mr. Sullivan,
are you talking to me, or...

24:34.896 --> 24:36.536
I'm talking to myself!

24:36.560 --> 24:38.168
Just...

24:40.752 --> 24:42.167
All right.

24:42.191 --> 24:43.672
All right?

24:43.696 --> 24:45.358
Run it.

24:45.795 --> 24:47.179
Let's get it done.

24:47.203 --> 24:48.444
Okay.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.748
ETA, Montgomery?

24:55.772 --> 24:57.092
Traffic's screwed.

24:57.116 --> 24:59.258
Can't you do something? Anything?

25:00.521 --> 25:01.956
- Ah, he's in full arrest, Montgomery!
- Dad!

25:01.980 --> 25:03.364
Shauna, I'm gonna need you
to move over here.

25:03.388 --> 25:04.643
All right, pulling over.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.316
Why are we stopping?

25:09.340 --> 25:10.915
Gotta get his heart beating again.

25:10.939 --> 25:13.662
Shauna, I want you to move up
to the front right now.

25:27.589 --> 25:29.164
That wasn't quick.

25:29.188 --> 25:30.371
- I got tied up.
- ‭

25:30.679 --> 25:32.767
Look, scans haven't changed.

25:32.791 --> 25:34.613
My diagnosis hasn't changed.

25:36.329 --> 25:37.896
Well, you mentioned a surgery
we could try.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.678
I did. You said hell no.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.224
How much is it?

25:42.248 --> 25:43.240
A lot, but I'm sure

25:43.264 --> 25:45.214
the department will foot your leg bill.

25:45.586 --> 25:46.682
See what I did there?

25:46.706 --> 25:48.176
The department can't know.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.703
If they find out
I have a chronic condition,

25:50.727 --> 25:52.774
they'll throw me a party
that ends with a desk job.

25:52.798 --> 25:54.831
Surgery's probably 40 grand all-in.

25:54.855 --> 25:56.719
And it might not work?

25:56.743 --> 25:59.055
I cut into your leg, try to cut the
nerves that are causing the pain.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.324
But nerves are tricky business.
Unreliable.

26:01.348 --> 26:04.330
As good as I am, and I am excellent,

26:04.354 --> 26:07.424
the surgery is only successful
about 50% of the time.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.450
Yeah, just give me more meds
for the pain, then.

26:10.474 --> 26:12.200
Robert, I'm a surgeon.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.350
I cure by cutting,
not by creating drug addicts.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.533
I'm not a drug addict.

26:16.557 --> 26:17.910
Mm. Not yet.

26:17.934 --> 26:21.118
You could try, uh,
meditation or, uh, acupuncture,

26:21.142 --> 26:25.356
but this is the last prescription...

26:26.084 --> 26:27.235
I'm writing for you.

26:46.523 --> 26:50.147
Seattle Fire Department!
Call out so we can locate you!

27:10.337 --> 27:11.560
You hear something?

27:11.584 --> 27:15.432
Seattle Fire Department!
Call out so we can locate you!

27:18.011 --> 27:19.267
I hear somebody.

27:24.763 --> 27:25.753
There she is.

27:26.485 --> 27:27.699
Here. I got her.

27:32.533 --> 27:34.205
All right. Let's go.

27:34.229 --> 27:35.539
- Ready?
- ‭Yeah.

27:36.164 --> 27:38.508
1, 2, 3.

28:36.266 --> 28:37.481
Come on!

29:14.670 --> 29:16.279
No! No!

29:23.771 --> 29:24.803
I love you.

29:37.133 --> 29:38.155
Hey.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.760
Oh... Oh!

29:39.784 --> 29:40.792
Yeah. ‭My dress.

29:40.816 --> 29:41.859
Left it at my apartment.

29:41.883 --> 29:43.055
I thought you were trying to stand me up.

29:43.079 --> 29:44.816
Oh, no. What? No.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.704
No. We're gonna have so much fun.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.149
- You okay?
- ‭Y... Um...

29:52.494 --> 29:55.144
- Something's wrong.
- ‭Okay, I didn't make the...

29:55.168 --> 29:58.022
I didn't make a great first
impression on your mother.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.360
Oh. It's fine.

30:00.384 --> 30:02.376
Everybody who meets her
thinks that. You're fine.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.190
Yeah, but she's Gucci, and so are you.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.188
I'm a sturdy gym bag.

30:06.212 --> 30:07.234
Don't say that.

30:07.258 --> 30:09.062
My parents own a restaurant,

30:09.558 --> 30:11.135
which has never been successful enough

30:11.159 --> 30:13.246
for them to even hire
anyone else to help them run it.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.879
So when I want to see them, I go there.

30:14.903 --> 30:15.870
Even when I was a kid,

30:15.894 --> 30:17.214
when I wanted to see them, I went there.

30:17.238 --> 30:18.590
I went to college on scholarships...

30:18.614 --> 30:20.659
Singing scholarships,
not smart-kid scholarships.

30:20.683 --> 30:22.291
So not only do I not come from money,

30:22.315 --> 30:24.904
I don't understand what it is
to come from money.

30:24.928 --> 30:27.006
I'm literally not sure
I'll know which fork to use.

30:27.407 --> 30:29.463
Uh, you and Maggie broke up
recently enough

30:29.487 --> 30:32.150
that she still scares me,
vaguely threatens me,

30:32.174 --> 30:35.159
and I'm also coming
from a funeral this week.

30:35.183 --> 30:37.302
That's bringing up...

30:37.326 --> 30:39.647
like, Ripley stuff for me.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.111
And this dinner party feels like
just enough added stress

30:42.135 --> 30:44.195
to make me question basically everything,

30:44.219 --> 30:47.015
so that's where I'm... at.

30:47.039 --> 30:48.583
- Okay.
- ‭Yeah.

30:48.607 --> 30:49.885
- Okay.
- ‭Okay.

30:51.707 --> 30:53.986
I don't own a single thing sold by Gucci.

30:54.010 --> 30:55.362
Right. Not one.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.724
And I have several sturdy gym bags.

30:58.148 --> 30:59.252
That's one.

30:59.276 --> 31:00.202
Two...

31:00.580 --> 31:02.924
no one ever gets over anyone that dies.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.675
We just don't... get over them.

31:05.699 --> 31:07.157
We just...

31:07.876 --> 31:09.708
go on.

31:09.732 --> 31:11.468
- Right?
- ‭Yep.

31:11.492 --> 31:12.745
Three...

31:12.769 --> 31:14.264
Maggie's a good person,

31:14.998 --> 31:18.440
and she is going through
way more right now

31:18.464 --> 31:20.168
than our break-up.

31:20.192 --> 31:22.110
Four...

31:22.631 --> 31:24.719
a woman who runs into
burning buildings for a living

31:24.743 --> 31:27.311
is infinitely more interesting
on every level

31:27.335 --> 31:30.531
than someone who knows
what fork to choose.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.451
I like you.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.331
I want my mom to like you.

31:35.355 --> 31:36.547
I want her to know you.

31:36.571 --> 31:39.268
And I'm curious as hell to eat
at your parents' restaurant.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.266
What kind of food do they make?

31:42.859 --> 31:44.362
It's Polish.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.280
I know. It's unexpected.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.193
I'm gonna see you tomorrow night.

32:00.561 --> 32:02.955
- Okay?
- ‭Yeah. Yep.

32:02.979 --> 32:04.257
- Good.
- ‭Okay.

32:06.715 --> 32:08.355
Jackson.

32:08.379 --> 32:09.719
What's that?

32:10.119 --> 32:11.229
Nothing.

32:11.253 --> 32:14.099
I just like saying your name.

32:15.227 --> 32:16.345
Okay.

32:17.630 --> 32:18.908
Yeah.

32:23.806 --> 32:25.628
You mad at those hoses?

32:26.205 --> 32:28.413
It's all just a big joke, isn't it?

32:28.437 --> 32:29.446
What is?

32:29.470 --> 32:31.334
How about our friend
who got shot to death

32:31.358 --> 32:33.723
by a 3-year-old
who's traumatized for life

32:33.747 --> 32:36.315
because his mom
didn't store her gun properly...

32:36.339 --> 32:39.720
A gun she needed for protection
against her own ex-husband?

32:39.744 --> 32:41.544
Now she'll probably end up going to jail

32:41.568 --> 32:43.848
and he'll end up
going into the foster system.

32:43.872 --> 32:45.352
Or the, uh...

32:45.376 --> 32:47.560
The bride who woke up
this morning and thought,

32:47.584 --> 32:50.535
"Maybe today'll be the day
that I forgive my father."

32:50.559 --> 32:52.711
But instead, she watched his heart stop.

32:52.735 --> 32:56.200
Oh, and the cherry on top?
Her dress got his blood on it.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.312
I mean, what kind of petty God

32:58.336 --> 33:01.896
takes away her father
and ruins her dress?

33:01.920 --> 33:04.222
But, uh, don't worry.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.459
We saved the life of the woman
who stupidly

33:06.483 --> 33:09.112
risked everyone's lives
to save her own merchandise.

33:10.867 --> 33:13.576
Maybe that stupid woman
learned something today.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.104
Maybe she got her priorities straight.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.911
Maybe she'll walk through life
just 10% less stupid.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.933
Maybe she'll cure cancer.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.555
We don't get to know.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.402
We saved a life today.

33:25.426 --> 33:29.105
The rest sucks,
but that part's a good thing.

33:29.129 --> 33:31.335
That's... That's a win.

33:33.940 --> 33:36.956
Oh, good. An uninvited
infringement upon my time.

33:36.980 --> 33:38.364
I lost a patient today.

33:38.388 --> 33:40.017
Sorry to hear that.

33:40.041 --> 33:42.257
The State of Washington has
excellent mental health coverage

33:42.281 --> 33:43.559
for first responders.

33:43.964 --> 33:45.689
I lost a patient.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.640
His name was Martin.

33:48.664 --> 33:50.112
His blood is still on my shirt.

33:50.136 --> 33:51.962
He had a daughter. Her name is Shauna.

33:51.986 --> 33:54.422
She's getting married without him now.

33:54.777 --> 33:57.121
He won't be there
to walk her down the aisle.

33:57.145 --> 33:59.168
Warren, do you think I'm
the Chief of just one station?

33:59.192 --> 34:01.718
Look, he didn't have to die!

34:02.290 --> 34:05.955
I could have saved him
if I had the necessary tools.

34:05.979 --> 34:07.834
Tell me what I have to do.

34:07.858 --> 34:10.954
You have to turn around, take
a right to the elevator banks,

34:10.978 --> 34:12.476
ride down four floors...

34:12.501 --> 34:15.324
Sir, with all due respect,
I am not accepting a no.

34:15.349 --> 34:16.603
How about a "you're fired"?

34:16.628 --> 34:19.288
You would be the only Fire Chief
in the country

34:19.312 --> 34:20.844
with a Physician Response Team.

34:21.315 --> 34:22.764
I mean, think of the press.

34:22.788 --> 34:24.684
Think of the public interest stories.

34:24.708 --> 34:29.186
And what is a whole lot
of good publicity worth to you?

34:29.601 --> 34:32.106
I mean, look at this face. It's pretty.

34:32.130 --> 34:33.737
Look at these hands.

34:33.762 --> 34:35.050
They are magic.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.034
But if you say no,
if you... if you fire me,

34:37.059 --> 34:40.203
then I'll just move to Portland,
take this gold mine to them.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.739
Give me half. Give me half the money.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.040
And I will get Grey Sloan Memorial

34:46.063 --> 34:48.167
to create a fellowship
to cover the other half.

34:48.190 --> 34:49.960
Thank of it, sir.

34:49.985 --> 34:51.681
Fire and medicine,

34:51.705 --> 34:54.263
working together, innovating,

34:54.286 --> 34:57.857
changing the way we save lives.

34:57.881 --> 35:00.663
I mean, c-can't you just see
the headlines?

35:02.469 --> 35:03.514
Yeah.

35:04.689 --> 35:08.131
On your feet, Fluff and Fold.
You're on laundry duty.

35:09.265 --> 35:10.895
Hey.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.161
- Hey, Hughie.
- ‭What?

35:17.185 --> 35:18.281
I'm in.

35:18.305 --> 35:20.657
I will go on the worst
triple date on Earth.

35:20.681 --> 35:21.782
You will?

35:21.806 --> 35:24.776
In exchange for seven nights
of laundry duty.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.888
What? No way.

35:26.912 --> 35:28.310
- Two.
- ‭Five.

35:28.334 --> 35:29.622
- Three.
- ‭Four, and I'll tell that story

35:29.646 --> 35:31.404
about that time you stopped
a snake from eating a baby.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.096
I am pretty awesome in that story.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.609
You are.

35:35.633 --> 35:36.821
Deal.

35:37.905 --> 35:38.937
Wear something fancy.

35:38.961 --> 35:40.167
You're not my mom.

35:44.606 --> 35:45.981
Gotta say, today feels like

35:46.005 --> 35:48.051
a "Fries and Milkshake after Shift" day.

35:49.430 --> 35:50.676
Fries and beers?

35:51.858 --> 35:53.658
Whiskey and beers?

35:53.682 --> 35:56.249
Can you... Can you stop?

35:56.273 --> 35:57.683
Stop what?

35:59.242 --> 36:00.715
Trying to pretend like

36:00.739 --> 36:02.748
this perky cheerleader thing you're doing

36:02.772 --> 36:04.508
isn't because I watched Ryan die.

36:04.532 --> 36:05.787
I'm not.

36:05.811 --> 36:07.483
I'm just trying to figure out
what you need.

36:07.507 --> 36:11.067
What I need is
for just one friend... one...

36:11.091 --> 36:14.004
To not look at me like
you're looking at me right now.

36:14.028 --> 36:16.920
One friend to just sit next to me

36:16.944 --> 36:20.471
and let me talk or not talk
or cry or not cry

36:20.495 --> 36:23.831
and not have an opinion about it.

36:23.855 --> 36:25.422
One friend. That's all I need.

36:27.087 --> 36:28.397
Can you be that friend?

36:29.714 --> 36:31.345
Yeah. I can be that friend.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.745
She's still not crying?

36:33.769 --> 36:35.057
No.

36:41.481 --> 36:43.527
Can I try?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.426
Be my guest.

36:57.404 --> 36:59.269
Sorry about your mom, Andy.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.218
So... like...

37:06.242 --> 37:07.850
you want to play "Sonic"?

37:21.601 --> 37:22.985
Congratulations on the promotion.

37:23.009 --> 37:24.457
What can I do for you?

37:24.481 --> 37:26.387
You filling that empty office
downstairs soon?

37:26.411 --> 37:27.785
Oh. You want your old job back?

37:27.809 --> 37:29.183
Not quite.

37:29.682 --> 37:32.794
Oh, you're... you're here
to lobby for Andy, huh?

37:32.818 --> 37:34.064
Actually, against her.

37:35.461 --> 37:36.782
You don't want her to be Captain?

37:36.806 --> 37:38.403
I do. Someday.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.256
I want her to have your job someday.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.081
I want her to be Fire Chief someday.

37:42.105 --> 37:44.342
And none of that'll happen
if you promote her now.

37:46.764 --> 37:50.035
I saw a look on Andy's face
at Ryan's funeral

37:50.059 --> 37:52.340
that I haven't seen
since her mother passed away.

37:52.364 --> 37:57.001
She went numb, wouldn't talk,
wouldn't eat, wouldn't sleep.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.527
She wouldn't even cry.

37:59.097 --> 38:02.104
And the only person that could
get her to feel again just died.

38:02.777 --> 38:05.440
And it's gonna get worse, her year.

38:05.464 --> 38:07.255
It's... It's gonna get a lot worse.

38:09.925 --> 38:12.457
She was nine years old
when her mother died.

38:13.656 --> 38:14.848
Andy's a grown woman now.

38:14.872 --> 38:16.801
She deserves Captain. She's earned it.

38:16.825 --> 38:20.161
She has one shot at this,
and I'm telling you,

38:20.185 --> 38:23.243
if you give it to her now,
she'll blow it.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.565
- She'll never forgive me.
- Probably not.

38:27.589 --> 38:29.695
But you'll be helping her career
in the long run,

38:29.719 --> 38:31.126
and if you love her...

38:34.738 --> 38:36.304
...don't give it to her... Not now.

38:37.810 --> 38:40.464
Andy's young and a hell of a firefighter.

38:40.488 --> 38:41.637
She'll get there.

38:41.661 --> 38:44.656
Just please, Robert...

38:44.680 --> 38:45.702
please.

38:47.048 --> 38:48.336
Not now.

39:03.667 --> 39:05.563
Sir, I'm not sure I understand.

39:09.683 --> 39:13.501
I'm recommending you
as Captain of Station 19.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.366
Unless you have any objections.

39:19.610 --> 39:21.134
No... sir.

39:22.712 --> 39:25.057
I won't let you down, sir.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.157
What just happened?

39:38.181 --> 39:41.005
Andy, uh...

39:43.749 --> 39:46.381
You should talk to Sullivan.

39:54.254 --> 39:56.279
I'm gonna die, Ryan.

39:56.303 --> 39:57.654
Pruitt...

39:58.089 --> 40:00.049
Whether it's in three months or a year,

40:00.073 --> 40:02.550
I'm gonna die soon, and...

40:03.605 --> 40:06.142
you are gonna be all Andy has left.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.111
I'll take care of her, sir.

40:13.175 --> 40:14.240
I know.

40:15.959 --> 40:17.717
I know you will.

40:19.272 --> 40:21.136
But you can't tell her.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.280
Or she'll just harass me
about not getting chemo.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.775
And you don't want to get chemo
again because...?

40:27.799 --> 40:29.911
Because the cancer's already spread.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.040
Chances are I'll be dead
in six months no matter what.

40:34.996 --> 40:37.308
And I never felt sicker
than when I was on chemo.

40:37.332 --> 40:39.516
I...

40:39.540 --> 40:42.172
do not want to go out that way.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.531
I need you to come back, son.

40:51.508 --> 40:53.435
Come back to Seattle.

40:53.459 --> 40:54.555
Be in Andy's life again.

40:54.579 --> 40:57.531
Be there for her when I go.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.993
I love her, Pruitt.

41:08.416 --> 41:10.089
I know that, too.

41:11.799 --> 41:13.799
Have a girlfriend,

41:14.255 --> 41:16.255
Andy has, her things, goin on.

41:20.704 --> 41:23.464
You want some advice
from an old firefighter?

41:24.974 --> 41:26.974
Always tell the girl.

41:27.254 --> 41:28.926
Tell her how you feel.

41:28.926 --> 41:30.719
You don't want to get to be my age

41:30.719 --> 41:32.719
with no time left
and wishing you'd told her.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.559
Just tell the girl you love her.
