00:00.150 --> 00:02.210
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.310 --> 00:04.430
I think I'm sensing a thaw where my mom's concerned.

00:04.465 --> 00:05.510
If she's letting us study together,

00:05.530 --> 00:06.920
a date can't be too far behind.

00:06.955 --> 00:08.450
- Mrs. Bloom.
- Yes.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.540
Could I take Amanda to the prom?

00:10.960 --> 00:11.500
Maybe.

00:12.570 --> 00:13.210
Yes.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.990
Maybe I am lazy and I lack study skills,

00:16.020 --> 00:18.240
but I've changed, and I'm going to do

00:18.275 --> 00:19.650
something important with my life.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.580
My test results are back. I'm officially in remission!

00:22.850 --> 00:24.520
I'm finally comfortable with where we are.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.290
- Which is?
- Friends.

00:26.990 --> 00:27.690
Friends.

00:27.730 --> 00:28.760
Without benefits.

00:29.110 --> 00:29.860
Brutal.

00:29.940 --> 00:31.140
Did you hear any of that song?

00:31.175 --> 00:32.530
- Uh, not really.
- Come in here.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.440
W-w-w-what does his opinion matter?

00:34.450 --> 00:35.310
He knows music.

00:35.570 --> 00:37.810
Brian told me all about the girl in the picture of Sarah.

00:37.840 --> 00:38.770
He said he created me

00:38.805 --> 00:40.690
from Sarah's genetic material after she died.

00:40.725 --> 00:42.940
"The biochemistry department cancelled the final exam

00:42.975 --> 00:45.100
after discovering honor student Sarah Emerson

00:45.135 --> 00:47.400
stole the test and vandalized the lecture hall

00:47.435 --> 00:48.480
in the science building."

00:48.515 --> 00:49.770
She gave everyone the answers.

00:50.070 --> 00:51.600
My mother was awesome.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.060
The way you've crossed boundaries,

00:53.270 --> 00:55.250
mixing your personal and your professional life,

00:55.285 --> 00:56.860
shows an alarming lack of judgment

00:56.895 --> 00:58.090
and ethical integrity.

00:58.150 --> 00:59.220
Challenge yourself.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.000
Incredible.

01:03.450 --> 01:04.250
Need a break?

01:05.459 --> 01:06.670
I'm just getting started.

01:06.820 --> 01:07.480
I'm fine.

01:08.570 --> 01:10.020
You can't keep doing this to yourself.

01:10.190 --> 01:11.340
Promise me you'll stop.

01:13.260 --> 01:14.140
I promise.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.400
Where did you get this?

01:15.410 --> 01:16.530
Someone left it for Jessi.

01:16.840 --> 01:17.700
We don't know who.

01:17.735 --> 01:19.340
Sarah and I used to bury messages

01:19.375 --> 01:20.620
for each other within the music.

01:20.650 --> 01:22.860
We'd translate the sounds into images.

01:22.895 --> 01:25.850
I gave Sarah a Latnok ring with a red stone.

01:26.190 --> 01:27.290
I thought Sarah was dead.

01:27.540 --> 01:28.180
She is.

01:37.710 --> 01:38.300
Never misses.

01:41.140 --> 01:41.750
Every day,

01:41.880 --> 01:43.610
we face questions of right and wrong

01:44.210 --> 01:46.260
and decisions about whether to take action

01:46.310 --> 01:47.500
or stay out of the game.

01:48.970 --> 01:50.860
And it's when those choices are least clear

01:50.895 --> 01:52.210
that we draw upon our conscience,

01:52.890 --> 01:54.040
follow our instincts,

01:54.680 --> 01:56.440
and reveal our true character.

01:58.380 --> 01:59.820
This is, like, the one place in the world

01:59.855 --> 02:01.340
where I've almost got the edge on you.

02:03.100 --> 02:03.990
What are you gonna do now?

02:06.020 --> 02:06.670
What?

02:11.830 --> 02:12.790
Like I said, almost.

02:14.020 --> 02:15.150
I do have an advantage.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.550
Tell me about it, pod boy.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.370
I'm talking about your ankle.

02:20.790 --> 02:22.160
You've been favoring your good one.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.870
Just hope the coaches at U-dub don't notice.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.010
U-dub?

02:26.560 --> 02:27.990
I'm working out there next week

02:28.025 --> 02:29.070
to show them what I can do.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.680
Can't let this bum ankle slow me down.

02:38.130 --> 02:40.220
So what's up with you?

02:41.130 --> 02:42.650
I mean, how are things with you and Amanda?

02:44.470 --> 02:45.120
It's good.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.250
Her mom's letting me take her to the prom.

02:47.840 --> 02:48.560
Cool.

02:48.950 --> 02:51.400
I just gotta think of the right way to ask her.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.800
Dude, it's not a marriage proposal.

02:55.010 --> 02:56.170
I just want it to be perfect.

02:57.060 --> 02:58.130
For you, deckie.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.100
Oh, I love that book. How do you like it?

03:02.810 --> 03:04.150
I'm not reading. I'm listening.

03:04.990 --> 03:05.690
Listening?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.920
You know, that's a really bad habit--

03:10.930 --> 03:12.110
eavesdropping on people.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.710
Tell me you wouldn't do it if you could.

03:17.700 --> 03:18.830
So what are they saying?

03:20.820 --> 03:23.210
Kyle just asked Declan who he's taking to prom.

03:24.190 --> 03:26.360
Really? And?

03:32.410 --> 03:34.280
They're talking about Declan's ankle again.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.340
Damn!

03:35.910 --> 03:38.370
Mr. Trager, I've just received the results

03:38.380 --> 03:39.840
from the placement exams.

03:39.875 --> 03:40.820
Please sit down.

03:43.430 --> 03:45.650
And your score went up

03:45.685 --> 03:48.620
by an astonishing 27% over last year.

03:49.010 --> 03:49.870
That's awesome.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.060
Mr. Trager, I take great pride

03:53.095 --> 03:55.440
in what the students at Beachwood can accomplish.

03:55.475 --> 03:56.900
Well, thank you.

03:56.935 --> 04:00.360
Which is why I find this situation so disturbing.

04:03.190 --> 04:06.420
You're a former remedial student

04:06.455 --> 04:07.480
with a C average.

04:07.570 --> 04:08.370
C-plus.

04:08.770 --> 04:09.530
Yes, well,

04:10.370 --> 04:13.790
it's just not possible to make such a dramatic leap

04:13.825 --> 04:16.709
without...assistance.

04:18.130 --> 04:20.000
Mr. Hooper, I busted my ass studying.

04:20.035 --> 04:20.790
Mr. Trager.

04:20.890 --> 04:23.130
I'll take that test again. Right here, Right now.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.770
There are too many other average students

04:25.805 --> 04:27.390
who scored well above the norm.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.810
Now, something is going on here.

04:30.150 --> 04:32.650
And I promise you I'm going to find out what.

04:33.410 --> 04:36.280
I will not tolerate cheaters at my school.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.500
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 21:
Grey Matters</font>

04:52.240 --> 04:53.390
That makes you feel better?

04:54.940 --> 04:56.580
The banana got Marie Antoinetted

04:56.615 --> 04:57.940
because I can't do it to Hooper.

04:58.330 --> 04:59.090
Funny thing is

04:59.320 --> 05:01.010
if you asked me who Marie Antoinette was

05:01.045 --> 05:01.910
about three months ago,

05:02.320 --> 05:03.840
I would've probably said

05:03.950 --> 05:06.090
that french foreign exchange student with the acne.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.240
But I've been applying myself.

05:08.810 --> 05:10.680
I found a new leaf, and I turned that puppy over.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.100
I know how much work you've been doing.

05:13.460 --> 05:14.790
You wouldn't cheat after all that.

05:17.200 --> 05:17.910
Would you?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.330
You're the human lie detector. You tell me.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.340
You didn't cheat.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.090
Now convince Hooper.

05:29.290 --> 05:31.030
Make the world safe for bananas everywhere.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.470
Tropical splendor. Your favorite.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.560
I didn't order this.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.680
You're here. I just assumed you'd ask.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.430
Thank you.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.390
Amanda, speaking of asking,

05:48.470 --> 05:49.820
can I have a straw?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.050
Oh, yeah. Sure.

05:52.460 --> 05:53.320
Sorry.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.260
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

06:00.370 --> 06:01.380
Step into my office.

06:04.610 --> 06:05.450
What?

06:06.410 --> 06:07.550
It's about the prom.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.530
Mrs. Bloom said I could ask Amanda.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.140
But I don't know how.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.490
I'll take this one.

06:18.780 --> 06:22.110
"Amanda, will you go to prom with me?"

06:24.770 --> 06:27.290
It's that easy? I mean, I thought that...

06:27.325 --> 06:29.200
If it were that simple, you must be missing something?

06:29.790 --> 06:30.570
Well, yes.

06:31.150 --> 06:34.140
Aw. And you came to your goddesses of all things estrogen

06:34.175 --> 06:35.270
for the real skinny.

06:36.470 --> 06:39.600
You came to us for girl advice. Just ask her.

06:44.940 --> 06:45.940
I'll do it now.

06:46.060 --> 06:47.660
No! You can't do that.

06:48.730 --> 06:50.440
Look at her. She's way too busy.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.440
And she has a big chunk of kiwi stuck in her hair.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.630
Okay. I'll do it when she goes on her break.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.580
She'll have low blood sugar, and her feet will hurt.

07:01.690 --> 07:03.060
I thought you said this was simple.

07:03.430 --> 07:04.520
The question is simple.

07:04.570 --> 07:06.110
But the timing of the question...

07:06.470 --> 07:07.950
Needs to be perfect.

07:13.310 --> 07:14.560
I heard your ankle hurts.

07:15.650 --> 07:16.790
Did it make the news?

07:19.340 --> 07:20.570
I think I can help you.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.130
I know how to work through pain.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.160
Maybe I could take yours away.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.230
Um, okay.

07:29.690 --> 07:30.800
Well, not-- not here.

07:30.820 --> 07:34.300
It has to be a secret, and you can't tell Kyle.

07:35.210 --> 07:35.960
Why?

07:36.900 --> 07:40.110
Because he doesn't like it when I do special things.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.840
Um, you know, thanks,

07:44.080 --> 07:46.800
but, uh, I think I'll let it heal on its own.

07:51.490 --> 07:52.970
It's good that you haven't told Jessi.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.110
It would be wrong to give her hope

07:56.130 --> 07:57.820
that her mother's alive before we're sure.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.000
And I'm concerned that she might tell Taylor.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.240
What do you think he might do?

08:03.260 --> 08:05.120
Use that information to try to restore

08:05.155 --> 08:06.310
his standing with Latnok.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.060
The same reason he keeps pushing Jessi.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.870
To impress them.

08:11.230 --> 08:14.340
There's no point. Latnok is done with him.

08:24.260 --> 08:25.830
Whoever sent this is very concerned

08:25.865 --> 08:27.100
about remaining unexposed.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.990
But if it is Sarah,

08:30.400 --> 08:31.900
why would she fake her own death?

08:32.710 --> 08:34.539
Why would she stay hidden all this time?

08:36.510 --> 08:38.070
Because people hide when they're afraid

08:39.549 --> 08:41.929
or when they want to reinvent themselves.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.260
Or when they're secretly healing themself from a gunshot wound

08:45.990 --> 08:46.710
True.

08:48.630 --> 08:51.080
But if she really is alive, why is she contacting me now,

08:51.690 --> 08:52.460
and not you?

08:53.530 --> 08:55.330
Because I failed her when she needed me.

08:59.850 --> 09:01.440
I can't believe principal Hooper.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.170
He was completely inappropriate.

09:03.205 --> 09:04.900
To hurl an accusation like that at you

09:04.920 --> 09:06.080
after the effort you've made.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.170
I've been profiled based on past reputation.

09:08.350 --> 09:09.210
We should sue.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.840
You sure your case would hold up in court?

09:11.200 --> 09:13.500
Please. I may have cut a few corners back in the day,

09:13.510 --> 09:15.310
but I'm an honest-to-go B student now.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.580
Well, I think principal Hooper needs a good talking-to.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.530
- I'll go with you.
- Oh, no, no.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.090
You don't need to miss your class. I can handle him.

09:21.540 --> 09:22.790
Go, Mrs. Trager.

09:29.140 --> 09:29.830
Now this one.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.930
That's too heavy.

09:37.850 --> 09:38.640
Be positive.

09:52.870 --> 09:53.590
That's right. You can do it.

10:01.170 --> 10:02.090
You can do it.

10:17.930 --> 10:18.810
Why did you stop?

10:21.040 --> 10:22.650
Oh, I'm bleeding.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.310
Just wipe it off and keep going.

10:24.345 --> 10:25.180
You were doing so well.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.810
Don't quit.

10:27.970 --> 10:28.720
Okay.

10:29.530 --> 10:31.700
Look, we need to show them that you weren't a mistake.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.410
We need to prove to Latnok that we matter.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.250
Well, all I do is train in here day after day.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.380
The time will come when we'll prove to them what you can do.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.130
Meanwhile, why don't we change up your routine a little bit?

10:50.480 --> 10:51.940
Tomorrow we'll take it outside.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.030
Okay, yeah. That sounds good.

10:56.910 --> 11:00.690
In the meantime, let's try it again.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.380
Hooper said there were other students

11:07.415 --> 11:08.960
whose grades didn't match their usual grades?

11:08.995 --> 11:10.520
Yeah. And apparently, I was involved

11:10.555 --> 11:12.910
in a crappy student cheating ring I didn't know about.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.570
How would that work?

11:14.640 --> 11:16.090
I mean, if you could've cheated?

11:16.440 --> 11:18.690
I guess the old me may have considered a cheat sheet.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.210
Impractical in this case.

11:20.220 --> 11:21.700
Way too much material to cover.

11:22.570 --> 11:23.570
Any other methods?

11:23.900 --> 11:27.380
Mmm, sneaking a peek at someone else's answers is an option.

11:28.310 --> 11:31.310
But I sat between Darryl Tibb, who was wasted at the time,

11:31.560 --> 11:32.520
and Kim Tresa--

11:32.790 --> 11:34.570
Hot as hell but no mental giant.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.750
If anything, they cheated off me.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.440
My only crime was doing better than Hooper expected me to.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.050
I should've bombed as usual and avoided this mess.

11:43.510 --> 11:44.840
No, you earned that score.

11:44.940 --> 11:48.130
Yeah, I did, and I really wanna keep it.

11:51.740 --> 11:52.380
Good night.

11:52.530 --> 11:53.240
Good night.

12:02.810 --> 12:03.590
Keep my secret.

12:11.630 --> 12:12.380
Anonymous

12:16.230 --> 12:18.400
Are you Sarah?

12:27.360 --> 12:28.240
Sarah?

12:33.550 --> 12:35.250
You can't accuse Josh of cheating

12:35.285 --> 12:36.950
because his score has improved.

12:37.050 --> 12:38.650
If you look at his records--

12:38.660 --> 12:39.650
That was last year.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.980
He's finally made a commitment to his education.

12:42.015 --> 12:43.080
You should be applauding that,

12:43.115 --> 12:44.890
not condemning him without any proof.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.760
Mrs. Trager, in my experience,

12:47.070 --> 12:49.200
numbers lie far less than people do.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.350
And unfortunately, these numbers show

12:51.385 --> 12:53.940
that you have two suspected cheaters living in your home.

12:54.050 --> 12:55.970
Now you're suggesting Lori's involved.

12:56.020 --> 12:57.730
No. No, not your daughter.

12:58.490 --> 12:59.260
Kyle?

13:00.210 --> 13:01.050
Come in.

13:02.650 --> 13:03.340
Hi.

13:04.260 --> 13:05.370
You've gotta be kidding me.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.470
I mean, why would the smartest kid at your school

13:07.480 --> 13:09.710
bother to cheat on a test he could take blindfolded?

13:10.050 --> 13:12.540
Mr. Hooper, Josh didn't cheat. Neither did I.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.950
It has come to my attention that someone

13:14.985 --> 13:17.420
hacked into the district's computer system,

13:17.540 --> 13:19.690
downloaded the tests, and then posted them

13:19.720 --> 13:21.580
on some sort of secret web site.

13:21.615 --> 13:22.700
The results being

13:23.120 --> 13:25.120
that students who were failing their courses

13:25.130 --> 13:27.430
managed to ace their exams.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.150
I want you to show me that web site

13:30.520 --> 13:32.230
and tell me who logged onto it.

13:32.530 --> 13:34.330
I don't know anything about a web site.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.500
You can't target Kyle for posting those tests.

13:37.510 --> 13:38.900
Even I'd know how to do that.

13:39.010 --> 13:42.620
Yes. But hacking into the district's mainframe

13:42.630 --> 13:46.030
is only slightly harder than breaking into Fort Knox.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.330
Now, do you know any other student here

13:48.365 --> 13:50.760
that could do that... besides him?

13:54.630 --> 13:55.590
What were you thinking?

13:55.940 --> 13:57.830
What do you mean? It's so Sarah.

13:57.930 --> 14:00.170
Except Sarah got in trouble for what she did at U-dub.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.720
Mmm, because she got caught.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.980
And she gave away the answers to the test.

14:04.015 --> 14:05.300
I just posted the questions.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.820
Why? For attention?

14:07.060 --> 14:10.260
No. Everyone was complaining about the exams.

14:10.270 --> 14:11.490
I just wanted to help them.

14:11.980 --> 14:13.280
Except Hooper thinks I did it.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.700
And now Josh and everyone who scored higher than expected

14:15.735 --> 14:16.880
is under suspicion.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.290
Well, maybe they cheated.

14:18.510 --> 14:20.660
Or maybe they studied really hard like Josh did.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.300
Look, all I did was post the test

14:22.335 --> 14:23.640
and help spread the word a little.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.364
I'm not responsible for anyone who logged on to check it

14:26.399 --> 14:26.540
out.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.520
- What is it?
- Nothing.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.990
Jessi, you promised you'd stop pushing yourself.

14:36.420 --> 14:37.240
I'm fine.

14:39.510 --> 14:40.910
You just got me worked up a little.

14:41.670 --> 14:42.710
Are you gonna turn me in?

14:45.450 --> 14:46.170
No.

14:48.250 --> 14:48.930
Thanks.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.640
Hey. Why is everyone smiling at me?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.440
Oh, word's out you're the hacker who posted the exams.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.230
I didn't.

15:11.330 --> 15:12.600
I know that, but they don't.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.190
They're impressed by someone who helped people cheat?

15:15.500 --> 15:17.570
Everyone looks for an edge. It's human nature.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.320
Did you look up the web site?

15:19.355 --> 15:21.540
No. But I would have if I'd have known about it.

15:21.870 --> 15:24.287
You've got a built-in advantage over everyone at this

15:24.322 --> 15:24.600
school,

15:24.635 --> 15:25.930
so a sneak peek at that test

15:25.965 --> 15:27.280
sort of leveled the playing field.

15:27.315 --> 15:29.050
They still had to look up the answers, so it's not--

15:31.390 --> 15:32.580
Is your ankle any better?

15:33.030 --> 15:34.370
The same, which sucks.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.340
I'll catch you later.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.030
Been there, done him.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.320
And him.

15:47.230 --> 15:49.130
We've been watching the same parade of neanderthals

15:49.165 --> 15:50.630
since seventh grade.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.850
I suppose I could tap into my inner lesbian

15:52.860 --> 15:54.190
and go with a hot cheerleader.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.150
You have an inner lesbian?

15:57.020 --> 15:59.040
To not have to go stag to prom,

15:59.075 --> 16:00.220
I would inner anything.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.760
Any news on the deejay? I need to finalize the budget.

16:03.890 --> 16:04.780
I'm working on it.

16:05.210 --> 16:06.890
On it or on him?

16:07.350 --> 16:09.090
You seriously have to stop it with that.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.390
You're interested in the deejay?

16:11.890 --> 16:14.360
I am not interested in the deejay.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.950
Is there a smart-girl quote for what just happened there?

16:18.530 --> 16:20.570
Methinks a lady doth protest too much.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.080
- Thank you, smart girl.
- You're welcome.

16:23.470 --> 16:25.920
So has anything delicious happened to you today?

16:26.050 --> 16:26.970
Hillary!

16:27.480 --> 16:29.430
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

16:29.750 --> 16:33.540
We're talking about smart girls and smart-but-clueless boys

16:33.550 --> 16:36.097
who need their friends' help to pave the glorious way to

16:36.132 --> 16:36.320
prom.

16:36.530 --> 16:39.200
Stop it. You're gonna spoil it for her.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.140
Spoil what?

16:42.780 --> 16:44.460
Both of you, spill.

16:46.810 --> 16:48.620
I can't help it. It's too cute.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.360
You're gonna be so excited.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.840
You really think you can help me?

16:58.930 --> 17:00.140
What changed your mind?

17:00.970 --> 17:03.200
My ankle hurts. It's really tight,

17:03.235 --> 17:05.119
and I've gotta be at the top of my game.

17:05.490 --> 17:06.640
You want to be the best.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.319
I wanna be my best.

17:08.700 --> 17:09.940
I know what that's like.

17:10.390 --> 17:11.930
So are you still into it?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.220
Well, the truth is I've never done anything like it before.

17:16.780 --> 17:17.900
Give it a shot.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.660
Okay. Just promise that you won't tell Kyle.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.069
I promise.

17:25.710 --> 17:26.670
Okay.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.010
So he thinks you're the hacker?

17:33.290 --> 17:34.960
Does Hooper know who he's dealing with?

17:34.970 --> 17:37.130
You're "Mr. Pure as Snow", I cannot tell a lie.

17:37.340 --> 17:38.303
I don't know about that,

17:38.338 --> 17:40.270
but I guess he thinks I'm smart enough to do it.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.710
Hooper thinks you're not smart enough to do well,

17:42.745 --> 17:43.970
so you must've cheated.

17:44.010 --> 17:46.250
And you're really smart, so you must be the hacker.

17:46.370 --> 17:48.220
We're both victims of Hooper's twisted logic.

17:48.370 --> 17:50.170
And I'm telling you, forget the bananas,

17:50.190 --> 17:53.400
cause I'm going straight to Hooper, and I'm gon--

17:53.530 --> 17:55.940
Hey, hey, Mr. Hooper. How's it going?

17:56.640 --> 17:57.970
Well, I'm very disappointed.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.020
I had hoped my students would show more conscience,

18:01.070 --> 18:02.890
but so far, no one's come forward.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.290
It's forced me to consider canceling the prom.

18:07.150 --> 18:08.840
What does the prom have to do with this?

18:08.920 --> 18:11.520
Nothing. As soon as you show me the web site.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.390
Mr. Hooper, I told you, it's the first I've heard of it.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.570
Well, then, maybe you can tell me who is responsible,

18:17.620 --> 18:19.900
and I'll take your cooperation into account.

18:20.970 --> 18:22.440
I am merely trying to protect

18:22.450 --> 18:24.760
the legitimate scores of honest students.

18:24.930 --> 18:26.530
Yeah, me included.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.740
Why do they look mad at you?

18:33.520 --> 18:34.500
I think they blame me

18:34.535 --> 18:36.180
cause principal Hooper might cancel the prom.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.060
Because of the web site?

18:39.070 --> 18:40.860
He wants to know who posted the exams.

18:43.420 --> 18:45.820
Okay. You want me to tell? Fine.

18:46.530 --> 18:47.500
But a lot of other people

18:47.535 --> 18:48.870
are going to get into trouble if I do,

18:48.905 --> 18:50.060
and I don't think you'd like it.

18:50.820 --> 18:51.670
What do you mean?

18:53.190 --> 18:54.620
If I show Hooper my web site,

18:54.630 --> 18:55.990
he could trace the IP addresses

18:56.025 --> 18:57.530
of every computer that logged onto it.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.120
I started to it already and kept a list.

19:00.670 --> 19:01.700
Why would you do that?

19:02.160 --> 19:04.060
Because I like to see the people I help.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.970
No, I don't wanna see that.

19:08.170 --> 19:09.000
You need to,

19:09.050 --> 19:10.350
to understand why Hooper can't.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.550
You still want me to tell him?

19:36.560 --> 19:38.160
The Hooper patrol's got you down, huh?

19:39.520 --> 19:40.240
Yeah.

19:40.590 --> 19:42.190
Let me whip you up today's special.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.540
You'll love it. It's fantastic.

19:45.690 --> 19:47.210
Uh, maybe later.

19:49.660 --> 19:51.030
Amanda, I need to ask you something.

19:52.150 --> 19:52.890
Oh.

19:53.950 --> 19:54.740
Okay.

19:55.850 --> 19:57.220
Please, ask away.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.470
There was a web site where someone posted

20:00.505 --> 20:01.890
the placement test in advance.

20:02.970 --> 20:03.980
Di--

20:07.830 --> 20:09.090
It's none of my business.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.970
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.340
I already do.

20:16.410 --> 20:18.770
I'd heard a rumor about the web site and logged on.

20:20.370 --> 20:21.600
When I got to the cover page,

20:21.635 --> 20:23.020
I just couldn't go through with it.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.480
I clicked right off.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.040
I never saw any of the questions.

20:27.250 --> 20:29.420
But why did you even go there? You always get A's.

20:29.470 --> 20:30.740
I fell so far behind

20:30.775 --> 20:32.250
when I came back from the conservatory.

20:32.790 --> 20:33.910
When I heard about the web site,

20:33.945 --> 20:35.210
I guess I just couldn't resist.

20:38.180 --> 20:39.580
I'll tell Hooper what I did.

20:39.720 --> 20:40.800
No, don't do that.

20:41.810 --> 20:43.390
Well, you and Josh didn't do anything,

20:43.425 --> 20:44.620
and you're getting so much grief.

20:44.740 --> 20:46.770
Amanda, how many people were tempted

20:46.930 --> 20:48.700
or looked just because they were curious?

20:49.960 --> 20:51.270
Don't say anything to Hooper.

20:52.060 --> 20:53.230
I'll figure a way out.

20:57.260 --> 20:57.970
Yes, Mr. Taylor.

20:58.380 --> 20:59.560
Jessi's almost ready.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.330
I know you don't approve of my creating her,

21:03.950 --> 21:06.150
but I appreciate the opportunity to show you

21:06.185 --> 21:07.530
that it wasn't a mistake.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.570
And I think that you'll all be very impressed

21:09.605 --> 21:10.510
with what she can do.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.380
Holy crap!

21:21.580 --> 21:22.610
How did you do that?

21:24.400 --> 21:27.260
Everything with an atomic mass has a gravitational field

21:27.295 --> 21:28.660
that can be manipulated.

21:29.540 --> 21:30.980
Huh. That simple, huh?

21:33.250 --> 21:34.110
It was a joke.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.470
Oh.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.890
Man, you and Kyle are so alike sometimes.

21:40.780 --> 21:43.530
You-- you, uh, you haven't said anything to him, have you?

21:44.450 --> 21:47.540
No. But why is it such a secret?

21:48.320 --> 21:49.750
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

21:50.270 --> 21:51.650
My father would be mad.

21:55.230 --> 21:59.280
So you're out here every day?

22:00.570 --> 22:02.820
Uh, well, I used to train inside,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.330
but now I start by running 13 miles.

22:05.510 --> 22:08.260
Wait. You warm up with a half a marathon?

22:08.830 --> 22:10.710
I have to condition myself so I'm ready.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.150
For what?

22:17.250 --> 22:18.480
Let's check out your ankle.

22:20.930 --> 22:23.390
Has your big brain figured out how to clear both our names yet

22:23.391 --> 22:23.392
Yet?

22:23.850 --> 22:24.910
I'm working on it.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.560
But I think it's only fair to tell you I have access to list.

22:29.150 --> 22:31.190
It's a log of all the IP addresses

22:31.200 --> 22:32.390
that looked at the web site.

22:32.450 --> 22:33.290
How'd you get that?

22:34.310 --> 22:37.020
It's not important. But...

22:37.100 --> 22:39.290
Your computer's not on there, so it should help your case.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.000
But I couldn't show it to Hooper

22:42.035 --> 22:43.350
without ratting everyone else out?

22:43.440 --> 22:44.270
This is true.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.260
Then forget it. Nobody's taking the fall for me.

22:50.050 --> 22:51.710
Dude, I've got morals.

22:52.420 --> 22:54.140
I know. It's just nice to see.

22:54.670 --> 22:55.260
Now, uh,

22:57.420 --> 22:58.720
show me who's on that list.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.840
Hey, I may have morals. I still wanna see who doesn't.

23:04.660 --> 23:06.180
I need to keep it confidential.

23:06.670 --> 23:07.300
Figures.

23:10.300 --> 23:11.090
You guys okay?

23:11.420 --> 23:12.760
Man, it sucks you may miss out

23:13.250 --> 23:15.070
if Hooper follows through and cancels the prom.

23:15.740 --> 23:16.580
Thanks.

23:16.740 --> 23:18.070
Have you asked her anyways?

23:18.790 --> 23:19.550
Bad timing.

23:24.730 --> 23:25.380
Bye.

23:30.180 --> 23:31.650
He's threatened to cancel prom?

23:32.320 --> 23:35.020
Okay, that is unacceptable-- to strong-arm you like that.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.340
I'd like to take principal Hooper and just...

23:39.510 --> 23:41.770
You and Josh like to take out your aggressions on food.

23:42.370 --> 23:43.700
Except he chops bananas.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.740
Yeah, well, pasta is much more satisfying.

23:46.970 --> 23:48.400
I have to call the superintendent

23:48.430 --> 23:50.150
and tell him how Hooper's been handling all this.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.040
I wish you wouldn't.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.870
Look, Kyle, with you and Josh both under the gun--

23:53.905 --> 23:55.870
I mean, I know you want to protect Jessi, but...

23:57.590 --> 23:59.620
She is the one who's responsible, isn't she?

23:59.660 --> 24:01.130
I don't wanna get anyone into trouble.

24:02.310 --> 24:05.140
She made a mistake. She needs to own up to it.

24:05.175 --> 24:06.130
She's willing to.

24:06.790 --> 24:08.640
But that would mean exposing some other people.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.530
How'd it go at school today?

24:16.090 --> 24:16.810
Awesome.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.200
Unless you count the big black cloud over my head.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.790
What's the point of trying

24:20.825 --> 24:22.190
when no one believes your grades anyway?

24:22.790 --> 24:23.460
Well, I do.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.310
Josh, I know it's been tough, but I am proud of you.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.090
I have to tell you, the way you turned your grades around...

24:41.000 --> 24:42.530
And more important, watching you

24:42.750 --> 24:44.540
support Andy through her illness,

24:45.880 --> 24:47.360
being such a loving friend.

24:48.450 --> 24:50.560
I don't think I had that kind of maturity at your age.

24:52.210 --> 24:54.390
In fact, I know I didn't.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.830
So you just keep doing what you're doing.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.340
Don't let the Hoopers of this world get you down.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.070
What do you mean?

25:31.770 --> 25:36.050
Taylor won't stop until he destroys her

25:36.440 --> 25:38.600
"Taylor won't stop until he destroys her"?

25:49.210 --> 25:51.680
What does that mean, Taylor's trying to destroy her?

25:52.590 --> 25:54.360
Well, Jessi said she stopped pushing herself,

25:54.395 --> 25:55.440
but I can tell she's lying.

25:55.950 --> 25:59.130
I can sense she's not well. Maybe Taylor's behind it.

25:59.230 --> 26:00.980
We still don't know who sent those messages

26:01.015 --> 26:02.120
or whether to trust them.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.660
I know I don't trust Taylor.

26:04.340 --> 26:06.090
Oh, I hate to say this, Kyle, but I--

26:06.930 --> 26:09.340
I don't think I can get involved when it comes to Jessi.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.770
My professional conduct is in question.

26:13.550 --> 26:15.330
That social worker who came here,

26:15.365 --> 26:17.750
she cited me for crossing ethical boundaries.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.190
You're the most ethical person I know.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.830
Thank you, but the truth is

26:22.865 --> 26:24.880
I've skirted the rules now and then.

26:25.820 --> 26:29.050
When I've needed to, I've cheated.

26:29.460 --> 26:31.610
If you did, I'm sure it was to help somebody.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.660
Well, I need to be careful now.

26:35.490 --> 26:37.530
And since I'm not Jessi's therapist anymore--

26:37.565 --> 26:38.270
I understand.

26:44.290 --> 26:46.310
You've already done so much to help Jessi.

26:53.970 --> 26:55.730
And that social worker was wrong about you.

26:57.210 --> 26:58.180
When you think about it,

26:58.215 --> 26:59.470
if you hadn't skirted the rules,

27:01.540 --> 27:02.980
I might not be here at all.

27:17.630 --> 27:18.590
You look cranky.

27:19.540 --> 27:21.130
I can't get this verse right.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.550
Can't help you there. I'm tone deaf.

27:24.670 --> 27:25.810
Hils, these are lyrics.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.130
I can rhyme a little.

27:28.270 --> 27:29.590
You have to be careful with rhymes.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.620
Too pedestrian.

27:31.850 --> 27:32.740
That's what Mark says.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.320
Why do you care so much what he says?

27:37.500 --> 27:40.150
Once and for all, this is a professional,

27:40.160 --> 27:41.800
one-song-only relationship.

27:42.150 --> 27:42.830
I hope so.

27:43.350 --> 27:45.200
Cause I really hate to see you blow off Declan

27:45.235 --> 27:46.660
for a taste of college boy pie.

27:47.220 --> 27:47.870
Declan?

27:48.830 --> 27:50.520
Can you honestly tell me that you still

27:50.555 --> 27:51.820
don't feel the sparkage?

27:52.050 --> 27:54.100
Declan and I are in a really good place right now.

27:54.135 --> 27:55.180
I don't want to mess with that.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.710
It doesn't have to be a mess this time.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.700
Away with you now. I need to be brilliant.

28:00.990 --> 28:02.950
Fine. I've done my job.

28:03.090 --> 28:04.480
Seed planted.

28:25.450 --> 28:26.240
Good job, Declan.

28:27.900 --> 28:28.700
Hey, what's up?

28:29.130 --> 28:30.250
I was looking for Jessi.

28:30.630 --> 28:31.850
Haven't seen her.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.040
It seems better.

28:34.260 --> 28:34.990
Oh, it is.

28:36.060 --> 28:36.730
Like magic.

28:44.210 --> 28:44.790
What?

28:45.030 --> 28:46.090
Your heart is racing.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.970
Yeah, I was just kicking ass in that game.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.720
Faster than when you walked over here.

28:51.870 --> 28:54.710
Man, oh, man, the CIA should snatch you up.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.360
I told Jessi I wouldn't tell you,

29:00.395 --> 29:02.910
but the whole thing creeped me out a little.

29:03.550 --> 29:04.440
She did something.

29:05.190 --> 29:06.090
I'm not sure how,

29:06.180 --> 29:09.370
but she made my ankle not hurt anymore.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.650
What did she do, exactly?

29:13.010 --> 29:15.970
She touched my ankle, and then she just concentrated.

29:17.010 --> 29:19.690
I'm not into that whole faith healer mumbo jumbo stuff,

29:19.710 --> 29:22.910
but...it does feel a lot looser.

29:24.050 --> 29:26.210
Maybe she manipulated the joint in some way.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.110
Or maybe it's just the power of suggestion.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.440
I was desperate for a fix.

29:32.090 --> 29:34.380
That tryout means everything to me.

29:34.730 --> 29:35.880
I know it does.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.060
You just need to make sure that your ankle's really healed

29:38.095 --> 29:39.250
so you don't hurt it again.

29:39.860 --> 29:40.820
Yeah, I get it.

29:42.700 --> 29:43.970
I appreciate you seeing me.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.530
Well, it sounded urgent.

29:46.390 --> 29:47.320
Please, sit.

29:47.540 --> 29:48.860
Thank you. I think it is.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.810
We both know it's dangerous for Jessi or Kyle

29:53.845 --> 29:55.990
to expand their abilities too quickly.

29:56.510 --> 29:57.790
And it's come to my attention

29:57.825 --> 30:00.070
you may be encouraging Jessi to do just that.

30:00.860 --> 30:02.260
It's come to your attention?

30:03.380 --> 30:06.790
You know, you seem to have this strange compulsion,

30:06.825 --> 30:09.830
Nicole, to interfere in other people's business.

30:10.750 --> 30:13.370
When a child's welfare is at stake, it is my business.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.910
You are no longer Jessi's therapist.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.540
She's doing just great.

30:18.070 --> 30:19.530
I'd still like to talk to her.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.340
Well, that's not gonna happen.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.050
Well, I hoped we could deal with this privately,

30:24.500 --> 30:26.270
but I'll go over your head if I need to.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.480
What, by involving social services?

30:28.750 --> 30:30.540
See, I don't think you're gonna do that.

30:30.730 --> 30:32.310
You're already on notice with them.

30:32.890 --> 30:35.330
And if you attempt to contact Jessi in any way,

30:36.800 --> 30:39.100
I will lodge a complaint with them, I promise you.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.750
You'll just have to do that, then.

30:42.950 --> 30:44.260
You went to see Taylor?

30:44.610 --> 30:46.710
And now I'm convinced he's up to something.

30:46.790 --> 30:49.040
He threatened to make trouble if I don't stay out of it.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.260
Well ,what do we do?

30:50.380 --> 30:51.660
Well, I'm not backing off.

30:51.780 --> 30:53.190
Jessi could be in danger.

30:53.750 --> 30:55.140
I'm not backing off, either.

30:56.270 --> 30:57.460
We've been through a lot.

30:58.820 --> 31:00.540
We'll figure out how to get through this, too.

31:05.430 --> 31:06.100
Nicole...

31:08.310 --> 31:10.510
What made you change your mind about getting involved?

31:12.610 --> 31:13.270
You.

31:30.060 --> 31:30.720
Jessi.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.110
What are you doing here?

31:33.340 --> 31:34.470
I'm worried about you.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.210
Declan lied to me.

31:37.730 --> 31:38.830
He promised.

31:39.820 --> 31:41.460
I don't know why Taylor's pushing you,

31:41.495 --> 31:42.540
but you need to stop.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.850
Brian wouldn't let anything bad happen to me.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.120
He cares about me.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.700
Does he care that your nose starts to bleed

31:49.735 --> 31:50.920
every time you strain too hard?

31:53.250 --> 31:55.170
Jessi, please don't listen to him anymore.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.930
What am I supposed to do?

31:58.220 --> 31:59.090
He's my father.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.700
A real father wouldn't push you this way.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.500
Yeah, well, he's all I have.

32:09.420 --> 32:10.040
Jessi.

32:10.100 --> 32:10.980
Go away.

32:11.750 --> 32:12.860
Please, go away.

32:37.890 --> 32:38.510
I understand.

32:38.790 --> 32:39.540
Mr. Hooper.

32:41.030 --> 32:42.620
I think I have what you've been looking for.

32:43.230 --> 32:45.750
Well, Mr. Trager, it's taken you a while,

32:45.785 --> 32:47.250
but I'm pleased you finally decided

32:47.285 --> 32:48.560
to follow your conscience.

32:48.780 --> 32:50.370
My conscience has always been clear.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.260
I didn't post the exams.

32:53.830 --> 32:55.590
But I can give you the internet addresses

32:55.625 --> 32:57.640
of all the computers that accessed the web site.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.520
But you should know, in total, there were 774 hits.

33:02.030 --> 33:03.230
Well, that's impossible.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.510
The entire student body is only 812.

33:05.545 --> 33:07.260
Clearly, not all of us cheated.

33:07.430 --> 33:11.030
Well, no, the scores don't reflect that, but--

33:11.065 --> 33:12.420
So I can give you the list,
and you can trace the addresses,

33:14.160 --> 33:15.360
but you can never be certain

33:15.395 --> 33:16.530
who simply checked out the rumor

33:16.565 --> 33:17.630
and logged off right away.

33:18.420 --> 33:19.910
And you definitely can't prove

33:19.980 --> 33:22.110
who actually stayed to copy the questions.

33:27.480 --> 33:30.130
The entire school will take a new set of exams.

33:31.170 --> 33:32.980
It is the only fair thing to do.

33:36.730 --> 33:39.840
Mr. Trager, if you have those addresses,

33:39.860 --> 33:42.010
then you must know where the web site is.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.670
Who created it, if not you?

33:48.120 --> 33:51.590
By withholding, it makes you an accomplice.

33:52.150 --> 33:54.050
Doesn't that also make you a cheater?

33:54.990 --> 33:56.600
I guess you could look at it that way.

33:57.640 --> 33:59.950
But everybody needs to live with their own choices.

34:25.550 --> 34:26.739
You think I should tell him?

34:28.960 --> 34:30.420
I just wish you'd be more careful

34:30.455 --> 34:31.699
about the things that you do.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.270
Hey, have you seen Kyle?

34:51.530 --> 34:52.179
Nope.

34:53.790 --> 34:55.139
Prom's back on, have you heard?

34:58.680 --> 35:01.050
You're such a sports movie clich right now.

35:02.020 --> 35:03.660
Feels like the right place to mope.

35:05.130 --> 35:07.430
Are you gonna tell me why, or are you still stuck

35:07.465 --> 35:09.200
in the flashback of the glory days?

35:10.410 --> 35:11.650
My ankle hurts again.

35:19.590 --> 35:20.830
It started to feel pretty good.

35:21.690 --> 35:23.530
But that was just temporary.

35:24.170 --> 35:25.740
All in my head, or whatever.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.040
Should've known.

35:28.700 --> 35:30.970
Nobody comes back from a surgery like mine

35:31.005 --> 35:32.680
and rocks a college-level workout.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.640
There will be other workouts, Declan,

35:34.675 --> 35:35.880
and other colleges.

35:36.270 --> 35:38.610
It doesn't matter if I'm not strong enough to play.

35:39.790 --> 35:41.170
It happens all the time, you know.

35:41.670 --> 35:43.590
People get injured, dream over.

35:46.050 --> 35:48.480
Well, look at the bright side, there aren't many point guards

35:48.515 --> 35:50.090
who fight evildoers in their spare time.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.930
Yeah, but with Kyle, I'm just a sidekick.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.440
But out here, with five seconds on the clock,

35:59.030 --> 36:00.110
3-point shot,

36:00.990 --> 36:03.260
I'd sink 'em half the time with my eyes closed.

36:05.840 --> 36:08.660
And cue sad, fallen hero music.

36:09.860 --> 36:11.850
Nice. Really helpful.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.720
What, you were on the express train

36:13.755 --> 36:15.130
heading south to Broodville.

36:15.165 --> 36:16.630
I'm pulling the emergency brake.

36:17.180 --> 36:18.810
Besides, I don't think that you could make

36:18.845 --> 36:20.400
a 3-point shot with your eyes closed.

36:38.520 --> 36:39.900
Ha. Fluke.

36:40.460 --> 36:41.840
And your eyes weren't closed.

36:42.590 --> 36:44.400
Fine, I'll do it again.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.020
You're on.

36:49.510 --> 36:50.330
You're amazing.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.010
I mean, you know when to listen

36:53.045 --> 36:54.080
and when to shut me up.

36:55.930 --> 36:57.130
You totally get me.

36:58.780 --> 36:59.810
Why wouldn't I get you?

36:59.830 --> 37:02.120
I mean, friends get friends, right?

37:04.970 --> 37:05.660
Right.

37:16.080 --> 37:16.800
You.

37:27.180 --> 37:27.960
Kyle...

37:29.600 --> 37:30.430
You did it.

37:30.790 --> 37:31.870
You found a way out.

37:33.380 --> 37:34.860
I'm just not sure everyone's too happy

37:34.895 --> 37:36.230
about having to retake the test.

37:37.450 --> 37:38.680
It was the right thing to do.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.280
Which, I hope you know, I don't always manage.

37:43.350 --> 37:44.590
Amanda, making the right choices

37:44.625 --> 37:46.070
isn't easy for me, either.

37:46.620 --> 37:47.960
But somehow, you always do.

37:50.380 --> 37:51.910
Kyle, you're such a good person.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.040
And I know you see me in a certain way.

37:54.075 --> 37:55.880
I just feel like I'm bound to disappoint you.

37:56.620 --> 37:57.650
You could never do that.

37:58.940 --> 37:59.610
You're you.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.980
Will you go to the prom with me?

38:05.700 --> 38:06.780
I've been wanting to ask,

38:06.815 --> 38:08.060
but the timing's never been right, and--

38:08.095 --> 38:09.390
The timing is perfect.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.770
And yes, I would love to go with you.

38:32.170 --> 38:34.480
Is it happy Hooper banana day?

38:34.640 --> 38:36.870
You stopped the inquisition. I've been exonerated.

38:36.890 --> 38:39.120
Wow, now I know you've really been studying.

38:39.140 --> 38:39.980
A few months ago,

38:40.015 --> 38:42.610
you didn't know the words inquisition or exonerate.

38:43.180 --> 38:44.820
A shot of wheat grass to celebrate?

38:45.370 --> 38:47.220
I'll take one of those beauties instead.

38:48.930 --> 38:50.740
What? Cancer couldn't do it.

38:50.830 --> 38:52.170
A pastry's not gonna kill me.

38:53.970 --> 38:55.240
I could cheat now and then.

38:56.070 --> 38:57.750
Hey, don't look at me. I'm no cheater.

39:13.450 --> 39:14.200
Tonight.

39:17.310 --> 39:18.640
What will happen?

39:19.800 --> 39:20.430
Hey, Kyle.

39:23.810 --> 39:25.640
Another shout out from Baylin's dead girlfriend?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.590
I'm still not sure.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.910
But if she was smart enough to stay hidden all those years,

39:31.440 --> 39:33.760
why would she send me IMs, knowing they can be traced?

39:35.920 --> 39:37.850
I'm hoping that's a rhetorical question.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.930
Maybe she wants me to find her.

39:42.440 --> 39:46.090
Right, so call up and set up a date like a normal person.

39:46.610 --> 39:47.540
Too risky.

39:47.810 --> 39:50.310
Phone calls, IMs, emails, can all be intercepted.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.500
Then what are you waiting for?

39:52.690 --> 39:53.580
Start tracing.

40:01.880 --> 40:02.850
Why aren't you training?

40:04.630 --> 40:06.630
I had a hard day, and I'm tired.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.760
Well, you've gotta push through the fatigue.

40:14.140 --> 40:15.030
Jessi...

40:15.820 --> 40:17.530
This isn't a game we're playing.

40:18.070 --> 40:19.370
This is your future.

40:19.770 --> 40:22.400
You told me I have to train so I can impress Latnok.

40:23.560 --> 40:26.400
When? when am I gonna do that?

40:27.260 --> 40:28.560
When I say you're ready.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.840
Now get up.

40:32.910 --> 40:34.900
My mother wouldn't treat me this way.

40:36.630 --> 40:37.940
Your mother's dead.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.110
In the past few weeks, I received four IMs,

41:11.460 --> 41:12.820
each from a different computer,

41:12.980 --> 41:14.530
and in four separate locations.

41:14.850 --> 41:15.650
The four dots.

41:16.290 --> 41:17.560
They make a perfect square.

41:18.210 --> 41:19.610
That can't be a coincidence.

41:20.040 --> 41:22.310
But even you can't meet up in four places at once.

41:24.070 --> 41:24.960
Can you?

41:25.720 --> 41:27.870
If it's Sarah, she must be leading me somewhere.

41:30.330 --> 41:32.140
Someplace inside the square?

41:34.280 --> 41:35.080
Exactly.

41:35.690 --> 41:37.200
Eh, when you're hot, you're hot.

41:38.850 --> 41:39.750
What'd I do?

41:43.660 --> 41:45.270
X marks the spot.

41:52.490 --> 41:53.500
I know that place.

41:56.060 --> 41:57.140
I know where to go.

42:01.050 --> 42:03.840
I realized the messages I'd received were my test.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.530
Whoever sent them to me needed me to solve a puzzle.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.900
And only when I found the solution,

42:14.790 --> 42:16.890
was I worthy of knowing the answer.

42:41.090 --> 42:41.930
Hello.

42:43.650 --> 42:44.520
I'm Kyle.

42:46.080 --> 42:46.990
I know.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.360
My name's Sarah.
