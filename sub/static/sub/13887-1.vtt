01:10.880 --> 01:12.871
Ooh... Ooh...

01:13.880 --> 01:15.916
Ah. Aah...

01:36.920 --> 01:39.150
Who the hell are you?

02:14.560 --> 02:16.710
Welcome back on-line, sir.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.998
- How are you?
- Not good. I don't know who I am.

02:23.160 --> 02:26.197
- Where is this place?
- You have amnesia.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.671
That's common
after prolonged periods in deep sleep.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.719
- You have been out for over 200 years.
- 200 years?!

02:33.880 --> 02:39.591
I tried to wake you in the spring,
but you insisted on another three months.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.429
I've just been preparing your breakfast tray.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.553
These cornflakes have got
grated raw onions sprinkled on them.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.870
That's how you like them, sir.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.271
Ugh! The orange juice is revolting!

02:53.440 --> 02:58.230
That's your early morning pick-me-up,
chilled vindaloo sauce.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.269
I drink cold curry sauce for breakfast?

03:02.480 --> 03:08.919
It depends. If you get up in the afternoon,
you prefer a can of last night's flat lager.

03:09.080 --> 03:14.632
That's why you keep a tea strainer
by your bed - to sieve out cigar dimps.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.236
I drink, smoke
and have cold curry sauce for breakfast?

03:18.400 --> 03:21.870
I sound like some barely human
grossed-out slime-ball.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.992
Oh, it's all flooding back, is it, sir?

03:25.160 --> 03:27.674
No. None of it is.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.116
Perhaps these will help.
Your personal artefacts.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.638
Kristine Kochanski. You dated her once before
she discarded you for a catering officer.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.389
- She's beautiful.
- It's your ambition, sir, some day,

03:40.560 --> 03:44.872
to win her back,
then lie on her and move up and down rapidly

03:45.040 --> 03:48.589
in that curious way
that humans find so agreeable.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.354
Personally, I prefer partnership whist.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.751
What? I play guitar?

03:56.960 --> 04:00.111
Do I have a head like an amusing ice cube?

04:03.240 --> 04:06.550
Chuck out some power chords.
See if anything comes back.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.354
Yeah! The axe man is back!

04:14.920 --> 04:19.755
Don't patronise me. I can't play.
Anyone with half an ear can tell that.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.911
When your personality is restored,

04:22.079 --> 04:27.200
you will firmly believe you can play guitar
like the ghost of Hendrix.

04:28.320 --> 04:33.348
Is there something good you can tell me
about myself? Something... laudable?

04:33.520 --> 04:37.149
Laudable... You sometimes help me
with my laundry duties

04:37.320 --> 04:42.792
by turning your underpants inside out
and extending the wear time by three weeks.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.028
I'm an animal. I'm a tasteless,
uncouth, mindless, tone-deaf,

04:48.200 --> 04:51.078
randy, blokeish, semi-literate space bum.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.556
Oh! Welcome back, Mr Lister, sir!

04:55.360 --> 04:59.797
- What's that?
- Mr Rimmer, sir. This is his light bee.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.710
- He's a hologram.
- Rimmer?

05:05.880 --> 05:09.395
- He's my best mate, isn't he?
- Sir, you are sick!

05:11.600 --> 05:14.910
Maybe a synaptic enhancer will do the trick.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.789
Initiating boot-up sequence.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.110
Downloading physical form.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.797
Access personality banks. Load arrogance.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.711
Load charisma.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.510
Load neuroses.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.071
Download memory.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.798
Oh, THAT Rimmer.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.358
Nice cornflakes. Nice and oniony.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.153
Pass the Tabasco sauce. Needs a bit more pep.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.158
Congratulations.
You're on the way to full recall.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.916
- You'll soon think you can play guitar.
- I CAN play the guitar!

06:27.080 --> 06:30.629
I'm a diva! I make that lump of wood sing

06:30.800 --> 06:34.998
like a Yukon bear trapper
on his annual visit to the brothel.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.555
Maybe, but the deal stays the same.

06:37.760 --> 06:43.278
I know. If I want to play guitar,
I have do it in outer space.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.829
- Peasants.
- I suggest we start debriefing.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.070
- Mr Rimmer?
- Thank you, Kryten.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.835
Now, gentlemen,
as we know, we have lost Red Dwarf.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.595
This is not the time for petty recrimination.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.797
The time for that
is when Lister is court-martialled.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.232
- I didn't lose it.
- You're the one who parked it

07:03.440 --> 07:05.510
and can't remember where you left it.

07:05.720 --> 07:10.555
They're all the same, those little blue-green
planetoids - blue-green and planetoidy.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.439
Sirs, there's no advantage in finger-pointing.

07:13.600 --> 07:18.071
We didn't lose Red Dwarf. It was stolen
by persons or life-forms unknown.

07:18.280 --> 07:23.513
Who'd steal a gigantic trash can with no brakes
and three million years on the clock?

07:23.720 --> 07:26.439
Rogue droids,
genetically engineered life-forms,

07:26.600 --> 07:31.355
figments of Mr Lister's imagination
made solid by some weird space ray.

07:31.520 --> 07:36.992
Who knows? The important thing is that after
200 years following the trail, we have them.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.397
- What do you mean?
- They had to make a detour

07:40.560 --> 07:43.313
to circumnavigate this asteroid belt.

07:43.480 --> 07:47.189
However, Starbug is small enough
to go through the middle.

07:47.360 --> 07:53.515
For the first time for two centuries, we can
head them off at the pass and recover Holly.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.837
You're forgetting
about Space Corps Directive 1742.

07:57.040 --> 08:03.229
1742? "No member of the Corps should ever
report for duty in a ginger toupee".

08:04.840 --> 08:10.312
Thank you for reminding me of that, sir,
but how is it pertinent to our present situation?

08:10.520 --> 08:12.511
- 1743, then.
- Oh, I see.

08:12.680 --> 08:16.150
"No vessel should transverse
an asteroid belt without deflectors."

08:16.320 --> 08:20.438
- Yes! God, he's pedantic.
- Rimmer, check out the supply situation.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.593
Your hologram's on battery back-up.
Oxygen for three months.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.320
Water, if we drink recyc, seven weeks.

08:27.480 --> 08:32.235
Worst of all, we're down to our last 2,000
poppadoms. We're in trouble.

08:32.440 --> 08:36.751
You know how unstable those belts are.
Rogue asteroids, meteor storms...

08:36.919 --> 08:39.308
One direct hit on that view-screen,

08:39.480 --> 08:43.359
and our innards will turn inside out
quicker than Lister's underpants.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.949
We're out of options. We're going in.

08:46.120 --> 08:50.955
Recommend the Cat pilots. His superior
nasal intuition will give us our best chance.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.869
For pity's sake!
One breach and we're people pâté.

08:55.680 --> 09:02.518
There's a Cat proverb - it's better to live
an hour as a tiger than a lifetime as a worm.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.350
There's an old human proverb -
whoever heard of a wormskin rug?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.156
Yeah, nice stickwork, man.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.389
- Something's coming.
- Nothing on the navicomp.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.909
I can smell it. Something big.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.590
- I'm getting nothing, either.
- These nostrils never lie.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.998
He's right. Co-ordinates 5341 by 6163.

09:34.160 --> 09:39.678
Take a peek. There's a meteor bigger
than King Kong's first dump of the day...

09:39.840 --> 09:42.229
and it's steaming straight towards us.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.320
- Too vast to go around.
- Reverse thrust!

09:45.520 --> 09:49.069
There's no time.
Face it, we're deader than corduroy.

09:49.280 --> 09:53.068
- Kryten, you know what to do.
- On my way, sir.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.795
- What's he doing?
- He's customised the waste disposal unit,

09:56.960 --> 10:00.396
turned it into a high-impact garbage cannon.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.876
You're going to shoot it
with tins and banana peel?!

10:04.080 --> 10:07.470
There's a surprise in there -
a thermos of nitroglycerine.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.309
- Waste disposal unit armed and ready.
- Kryten, will this work?

10:11.480 --> 10:13.436
Lie mode.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.797
Of course it'll work, sir. No worries.

10:18.360 --> 10:22.876
Hook, line, sinker, rod
and copy of "Angling Times", sir.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.233
- Here it comes!
- Ready, Kryten? Fire!

10:29.080 --> 10:30.399
<i> Yes!</i>

10:32.680 --> 10:35.831
Relocating Red Dwarf's trail.
At present speed and course,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.798
estimated time to interception,
12 hours, 7 minutes.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.675
I'm getting something new,
and it does not smell good.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.757
There. Got it. Looks like some kind of ship.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.911
Wait, there's another... and another.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.237
- I'm getting them too. Ten... no, twelve.
- All derelicts.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.233
It's like a giant spaceship graveyard.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.351
Who else feels that we've been led here
like lambs to a kebab shop?

11:04.560 --> 11:07.757
We don't move
till we know what happened here.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.036
Recommend we stop and launch scouter.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.231
Engines stopped. Scouter launched.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.112
<i> We're in.</i>

11:25.320 --> 11:27.993
- What's that?
- Human remains.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.914
Wait. Angle up five degrees.
Across ten degrees.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.838
There. Some kind of writing on the floor.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.790
P- S-l-R-E-N-S.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.313
Psirens.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.392
The poor devil scrawled it in his death throes,

11:45.560 --> 11:50.156
using a combination of his own blood
and even his own intestines.

11:50.320 --> 11:54.791
- Who would do that?
- Someone who badly needed a pen.

11:57.080 --> 12:02.154
Why go to the trouble
of using his kidney as a full stop?

12:03.240 --> 12:07.711
I don't think he meant that.
It probably just plopped out.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.155
Whoever he was, he was desperate to warn
any wretches who wandered into the same trap.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.629
Scouter's located the black box.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.910
OK. Replay final entry.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.514
<i>They're closing in.</i>
<i>They're all over the ship.</i>

12:28.920 --> 12:32.913
<i>I know I'm next.</i>
<i>It's just a matter of time before...</i>

12:33.360 --> 12:37.433
<i>Oh, God! You're beautiful!</i>
<i>I can't resist you.</i>

12:37.600 --> 12:41.309
<i>Have to be strong. I know what you want!</i>

12:41.480 --> 12:48.192
<i>No, you don't want to love me. You want</i>
<i>to suck out my brains with that straw.</i>

12:48.360 --> 12:50.510
<i>Get away from me!</i>

12:53.040 --> 12:55.793
<i>What have you done, you evil harlot!</i>

12:55.960 --> 12:59.077
<i>You've squeezed the ketchup out of my burger!</i>

12:59.240 --> 13:03.677
<i>Now what? No! Get that straw out of my ear!</i>

13:21.400 --> 13:25.837
OK. Scouters checked out black boxes
on three of the derelicts.

13:26.040 --> 13:30.716
This belt is swarming with some kind
of genetically engineered life-form

13:30.880 --> 13:33.440
who can alter your perception telepathically.

13:33.600 --> 13:37.149
They're called Psirens,
like with Ulysses in the Turkish legend.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.510
- The legend was Greek, sir.
- Whatever.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.638
Some country big on curly shoes and hoummos.

13:42.800 --> 13:47.510
They use this power of illusión
to lure you onto the asteroids.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.832
Then they take whatever they can use...
and suck out your brains.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.316
They shouldn't bother us.
There's barely a snack on-board.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.918
We can't turn back. We'll lose Red Dwarf.

14:00.120 --> 14:04.830
We'll be through the belt in four hours.
Just stay on the case.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.028
They'll try to tempt us, scare us -
anything to force us onto the rocks.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.470
Incoming message.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.631
It's pretty weak.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.831
<i>Please help us.</i>
<i>Our settlement is almost extinct.</i>

14:20.000 --> 14:23.310
- <i>There are only women left.</i>
- <i>Barely 3,000 of us.</i>

14:23.480 --> 14:28.793
<i>If we are to survive, we need males</i>
<i>to spread their seed amongst our number.</i>

14:28.960 --> 14:33.238
- <i>We beg you... make love to us.</i>
- <i>Make love to all of us.</i>

14:33.440 --> 14:38.594
You heard 'em,
they want seed-spreaders. I'm going to apply.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.833
You guys deal with this Psiren thing.
I'll deal with this.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.915
Call me paranoid,
but you don't think they were Psirens?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.956
Even the brunette?

14:56.320 --> 15:00.711
If you want me, I'll be taking
a cold shower in liquid oxygen.

15:02.040 --> 15:08.593
If that's the most sophisticated enticement
they can throw at us, we're hardly in danger.

15:08.800 --> 15:14.272
If I may postulate, that was merely the level
of sophistication required to lure the Cat.

15:14.440 --> 15:19.036
Had we not stopped him,
he would be on an asteroid, with no brain,

15:19.200 --> 15:24.274
trying to write "Oh, boy, was I suckered?"
With his own intestinal tract.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.671
Incoming message. Here they go again.

15:31.480 --> 15:35.075
<i>This Captain Tau of the SCS Pioneer.</i>
<i>We're under attack.</i>

15:35.240 --> 15:39.677
<i>Some form of scavengers... Psirens.</i>

15:39.840 --> 15:44.391
<i>They lured us onto this asteroid,</i>
<i>killed most of the crew.</i>

15:46.320 --> 15:48.595
Is this genuine?

15:51.240 --> 15:54.437
<i>Don't try to help us.</i>
<i>We're finished. Save yourselves.</i>

15:54.600 --> 15:58.149
- Kochanski!
- <i>Dave? Is that you?</i>

15:58.320 --> 16:01.869
- I thought you were dead.
- <i>No time to explain.</i>

16:02.040 --> 16:05.316
- <i>Get out of the belt while you can!</i>
- It's Kochanski.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.478
<i>We'll be OK. They'll never take us alive.</i>

16:08.640 --> 16:12.679
<i>I'm keeping three bullets,</i>
<i>for me and the two kids.</i>

16:12.880 --> 16:16.077
- Kids?!
- <i>Your two sons, Dave.</i>

16:16.240 --> 16:18.231
How...? L-I don't understand.

16:18.440 --> 16:22.718
<i>When you went into stasis,</i>
<i>I broke into the sperm bank on Red Dwarf.</i>

16:22.920 --> 16:28.711
<i>You're a father. Here they come!</i>
<i>Jim, Bexley, come to Mummy.</i>

16:28.920 --> 16:32.674
Wait! I'm coming!
Kryten, bazookoids. Rimmer, plot a course.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.110
Tune into Sanity FM!

16:36.040 --> 16:41.068
- You saying they were Psirens?
- It's as plain as a Bulgarian pin-up.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.634
- More trouble heading straight for us.
- What?

16:44.800 --> 16:47.519
What do you call
giant meteorites covered in flames?

16:47.680 --> 16:50.069
- Giant flaming meteorites.
- That's it.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.436
Should I load the garbage cannon?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.830
- It wouldn't make a dent.
- Course change.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.759
- Engaging re-heat.
- There's nothing on the radar.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.996
- So?
- I think it's another illusión.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.589
- Psirens?
- Cat? Are you getting any scent from it?

17:06.760 --> 17:09.148
They got a duty-free shop?

17:09.359 --> 17:11.430
- Can you smell anything?
- No.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.348
Suggest we maintain present course.
That fireball does not exist.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.915
- Say you're wrong?
- I'll stake my reputation.

17:18.119 --> 17:21.907
- You haven't got a reputation.
- I will after this escapade.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.275
It's closing. Too late to run.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.710
Relax, gentlemen. You're quite safe.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.310
Ah. Smug mode.

17:32.480 --> 17:37.270
Well... I can't hang around here
saving your necks all day.

17:37.440 --> 17:41.319
I guess I'll make a start on that ironing.

17:42.760 --> 17:47.470
I'm getting another one.
Better get Kryten. He'll know what to do.

17:47.640 --> 17:53.556
I'm perfectly capable of dealing with a giant
flaming meteorite, thank you very much.

17:53.720 --> 17:58.794
We do not need help from a droid with
a head like a genetically flawed lumpfish.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.635
OK, keep your "H" on. So what do we do?

18:02.800 --> 18:05.758
There's nothing on the radar. We do nothing.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.754
Guys, what's happening?
Cabin temperature's rising.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.599
Psirens again. Another illusión. It's in hand.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.190
What if the fireball's real
and the radar read-out's the illusión?

18:16.400 --> 18:18.675
Gentlemen, relax. We're quite safe.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.513
- Any damage?
- Not too bad. Two sensors are out,

18:37.680 --> 18:43.277
fuel-intake chambers are flooded
and the seat doesn't go up and down any more.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.313
- We're intact?!
- Starbug was built to last, sir.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.393
This baby's crashed more times than a ZX81.

18:51.080 --> 18:56.916
It's what it's made of. Aerospace engineers
discovered that, after a plane crash,

18:57.080 --> 19:02.791
the one thing that survives is a cute doll,
so they built this with the same stuff.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.639
- Is that a fact?
- You're so gullible.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.559
Thanks!

19:07.760 --> 19:11.196
- How long before we can take off?
- Just... Oh, wait.

19:11.360 --> 19:16.036
The front landing stanchion is embedded
in rock. We have to blast it free.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.595
- I'll go.
- Sir, the atmosphere is thin,

19:18.760 --> 19:21.069
and this place is crawling with Psirens.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.796
You look after the engine.
I'll go and be brave. Two minutes maximum.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.638
- How's that?
- <i> Looking good.</i>

19:32.800 --> 19:34.995
<i>We'll clear the rest on take-off.</i>

19:35.560 --> 19:39.872
- On me way back.
- Hi, Dave.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.551
- Smeggin' hell. Pete Tranter's sister?
- Remember me, Dave?

19:44.720 --> 19:48.315
You lusted after me all through your puberty.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.598
And now, at last, I can be yours.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.872
Stay back. I know what you want.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.430
It's in my head. That's where it's staying.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.068
You know what you want.

20:03.240 --> 20:09.110
You want to squeeze my buttocks together
to make one juicy giant peach.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.513
I get it. You want me
to drown in my own drool.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.559
- Don't fight it.
- Stay back, Pete Tranter's sister.

20:18.720 --> 20:22.679
How long has it been
since you made love to a woman?

20:23.920 --> 20:26.718
I admit it's been a while.

20:26.880 --> 20:30.919
- It's been three million years.
- I count it in ice ages.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.868
Then it's only four.
In leap ice ages, hardly even one.

20:36.320 --> 20:40.518
That's a long time, Dave,
for a man of your drives.

20:40.720 --> 20:46.158
It's a long time for an Albanian shepherd
who's allergic to wool.

20:47.160 --> 20:51.551
- Kiss me.
- I can't resist you any more.

20:52.480 --> 20:58.237
Your death will be exquisite.
I'll take you to the peak of ecstasy,

20:58.400 --> 21:01.039
then I'll blow your mind.

21:24.320 --> 21:27.312
Come on, Dave. Let's get out of here.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.997
"Dave"?

21:35.520 --> 21:38.671
- <i> Sir? Is everything OK?</i>
- What's the delay?

21:38.840 --> 21:42.355
<i> Two Psirens killed each other</i>
<i>fighting over my brains.</i>

21:42.520 --> 21:46.229
<i>Oh, smeg. It's the TV weather girl</i>
<i>from Channel 27.</i>

21:46.400 --> 21:49.198
- Fight it. Don't look.
- <i>It's not that easy.</i>

21:49.360 --> 21:51.476
<i>You can't see what she's doing.</i>

21:51.680 --> 21:55.639
- I'm starting up the engines.
- Get back in here now!

21:55.800 --> 21:57.791
<i>On me way.</i>

21:59.480 --> 22:00.833
<i>It's me.</i>

22:02.120 --> 22:04.680
It's getting hairy out there. Let's vamoose.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.949
<i>Why the hell are you taking off? Let me in!</i>

22:09.160 --> 22:13.472
- Sir, you're already here.
- He's a Psiren. Don't let him in.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.952
<i>For God's sake! He's the Psirenl Let me in!</i>

22:18.160 --> 22:20.958
- What do we do?
- We've got to let him in.

22:21.160 --> 22:26.712
Then we'll definitely have a Psiren on-board,
a psychotic temporal lobe slurper.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.309
There's a 50% chance we already have.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.755
We can't risk killing Mr Lister.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.837
How many times? He's the Psiren. I'm me.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.515
How can you believe this?!
He doesn't even look like me.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.393
He's podgy. He hasn't got my profile.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.309
- You're both identical.
- No way!

22:50.520 --> 22:52.909
I'm going to try some tests.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.674
Both right-handed. Correct. Kryten?

23:01.760 --> 23:04.194
Now, gentlemen. Trim your toenails.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.556
Enough!

23:13.720 --> 23:16.109
- Play the guitar.
- What?

23:16.280 --> 23:19.477
- Here? Inside?
- Play it.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.318
- How did you know?
- That dude could play.

23:42.520 --> 23:46.718
- He was no better than me.
- That's how you believe you play.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.838
The Psiren read your mind,
sharing your delusión

23:50.000 --> 23:53.197
that you are NOT
a tone-deaf, talentless noise-polluter.

23:53.400 --> 23:57.029
You're seriously saying
you think he was better than me?

24:04.240 --> 24:06.834
- What's the difference?
- Little survival tip, bud.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.197
Never play in front of a man with a gun.

24:10.400 --> 24:15.793
I resent this.
I resent you saving my life in this way.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.030
Er... Where's it gone?

24:18.240 --> 24:21.630
It's crawled down to the engine room.

24:21.800 --> 24:24.109
Meteor storm off the starboard bow!

24:24.320 --> 24:27.551
Suggest Mr Rimmer and I pursue the Psiren.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.955
Er... That's QUITE a good plan.

24:31.120 --> 24:36.114
Excellent but for one detail.
I think you know what it is. Bye!

24:53.640 --> 24:57.394
Please, there's no logic
in trying to engage me in combat.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.836
I am unseduceable in that I have no desires,

25:01.000 --> 25:06.028
and my brain is synthetic
and of no use to you. Give yourself up.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.559
Professor Mamet? My creator.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.358
- Hello, Kryten.
- What is the function of this illusión?

25:13.560 --> 25:18.475
You cannot harm me. It's coded into you.
You're totally defenceless against me.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.752
True. However,
the others are not so hampered.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.839
You're also programmed
to obey my commands. Drop the radio.

25:27.920 --> 25:31.879
- Open the waste compactor.
- What are you doing?!

25:32.080 --> 25:35.550
- Climb inside.
- No! No!

25:36.240 --> 25:39.038
- This serves no...
- Engage the mechanism.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.912
You are sick!

25:44.440 --> 25:45.873
Die.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.150
Kryten? You there?

25:50.360 --> 25:55.434
The meteor storm was an illusión.
The Psiren's not as badly injured as we thought.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.919
Kryten?

26:01.440 --> 26:03.795
- It's got him.
- Kryten!

26:10.240 --> 26:14.233
My battery's going.
Only seconds left. I need a recharge...

26:16.440 --> 26:19.113
And then there were two.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.909
- Want a drink?
- Buddy, I'm parched.

26:27.120 --> 26:32.148
Wait a minute. What's a vending machine
doing in the engine room?

26:50.080 --> 26:52.150
I'm almost annoyed.

27:20.560 --> 27:24.314
- We're clear of the belt.
- What about Red Dwarf?

27:24.480 --> 27:27.074
It's gone into that gas nebula.

27:27.280 --> 27:30.158
Then that's where we're heading.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.000
- Tea?
- Cheers, man.

27:33.160 --> 27:38.280
Don't put it on the console, sir.
It leaves ugly rings. Use me as a table.

27:38.440 --> 27:42.991
- I thought you were fixing yourself.
- Not before I've finished my duties, sir.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.152
I can't go engaging my self-repair unit,

27:46.320 --> 27:50.711
not with a pile of laundry
like the north face of the Eiger.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.555
Besides, Cat has invited me
to the crap game tonight.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.194
He's gonna be the dice.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.511
- Approaching nebula.
- <i> Well, let's see what's in there.</i>

28:05.920 --> 28:09.230
<i># It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

28:09.400 --> 28:12.710
<i># I'm all alone, more or less</i>

28:12.880 --> 28:16.031
<i># Let me fly far away from here</i>

28:16.200 --> 28:18.760
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:18.920 --> 28:22.629
<i># In the sun, sun, sun</i>

28:22.800 --> 28:26.076
<i># I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose</i>

28:26.240 --> 28:29.277
<i># Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

28:29.440 --> 28:32.716
<i># Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes</i>

28:32.880 --> 28:35.519
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:35.680 --> 28:39.229
<i># In the sun, sun, sun</i>

28:39.400 --> 28:42.198
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:42.360 --> 28:46.433
<i># In the sun, sun, sun #</i>
