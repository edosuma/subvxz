04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Life... upon my life.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Ohh. So beautiful.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I know.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
They're coming.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Don't worry. Don't Worry.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I'll take care of you.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Did you understand everything?

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
It's very important.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
All right?

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Let's go then.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
I'm coming.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
We know. We saw them coming.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Now, don't be frightened.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm going to hide you...

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
... in a nice, safe place.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
What a shame we did not have more time.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Andre Toulon?

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Mr. Toulon.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
You can't save her, Alex.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Do you see something, ma'am?
Oh, yes.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I see many great things for you.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah?

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
You have a wonderful life 
ahead of you, young lady.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Do you see marriage, maybe?

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Most definitely.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
In a very short period of time, 
you two are gonna be happily married.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
And you are gonna to have...

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
...a little boy.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
No...
Yes, you are...

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
He's a rambunctious little buddy,
but he's gonna be a good little boy.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
And then you're gonna have a little girl.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
You know, ma'am, that's really 
great. I like that, but, umm...

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
...do you think Buddy here's ever gonna get...

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
...a real job?

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
I see retail sales.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
What?

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Retail sales?
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
You better look again, because...

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
Buddy here, he flunked out of the tenth grade...

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
... I don't see how he can be in retail sales.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
But you see here I see construction.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
I see you working as a foreman...

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
... of a construction company...

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
... in a retail store.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Kind of like an enormous shopping mall.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
You are gonna to be a rich man.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
You are gonna to build a shopping mall.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Yes, sir, you are gonna to be a rich man.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
Oh, maybe I will marry him, then.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
I sit next to a very rich man.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
I'm a gold mine.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
What else do you see, ma'am?

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
All I think I see is your grandmother.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
She isn't going to be around very long.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
My grandmother's already dead, ma'am.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Well, it's...

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
... it's really your grandmother.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh, Buddy.
I'm sorry.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Ma'am?

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
I think something's wrong with her.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
- Ready, Carlissa?
- Yes.
- Ok

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Now commencing real-time thought 
transmission experiment...

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
... RT 638.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Passive subject: Andrea Clark.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
Active subject: Carlissa Stamford.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
All right, Andrea.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
I want you to recreate in your mind...

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
... your wildest sexual fantasy...

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
... paying particular attention to the details.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
All right?

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Good.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
All right, Carlissa?

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Yes.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Begin sequence...

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
... now.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Are you getting anything about a man...

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
... on a horse, in the rain?

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
No.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
Now she's running down the beach...

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
... and she's naked.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
He's getting very close to her.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
You're not getting any of this?

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
No.
Why am I getting this...

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
... and you're not?

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
This little girl has a very vivid imagination.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Alex.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Hello, Alex.
We were expecting your call.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
You've had contact too, then?

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
Yes, last night while we were experimenting.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
It was very, very strong.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
What... what does it mean?

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Why all of us at once?

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
It means Gallagher located...

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
... the old puppet master's hiding place.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
...and he's calling for some kind of a meeting.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
We also received a call from the white witch.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
Oh, you mean Dana?

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
Yes...
... the lovely Dana.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
She knows the location.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
It's an old hotel on the Californian coast...

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
... called the Bodega Bay Inn.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
I want you to come along, Alex.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
We'll need all our collected powers.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
Dana feels that this is not 
going to be a friendly meeting.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Well, I don't know who they think they are.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
... just barging in here out of the blue.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
They're probably the friends Neil said would come.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
They don't look like friends to me.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
They look more like trouble.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Shhh. Theresa, don't be rude.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Hello.
I'm Megan Gallagher.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
Somebody married Neil?

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
Hi, I'm Alex Whitaker.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I'm Frank Forrester.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
This is Dana Hadley and...

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
... Carlissa Stamford.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Hello.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
I hope this visit wasn't entirely unexpected.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
No, no. Neil told me you'd be coming.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
And where might old Neil be?

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
I thought you knew.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Knew what?

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
He shot himself.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
But why?

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
That's the hard part.
I don't know why.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
He left a note...

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
... but all he said was 
he didn't want to be buried...

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
... until you all arrived.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
So now that you're here, we'll bury him tomorrow.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
You can stay.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Of course.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
No problem.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
Well, I'll show you to your rooms,
and then we'll see about some dinner.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Excuse me, Mrs. Gallagher.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Would you mind if...

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
... we stayed behind a while...

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
... to pay our respects?

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
No, not at all.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
I think Neil would appreciate that.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
Thank you.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Thank you.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Don't touch the body.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Frank, what the hell is
going on around here?

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
And how is it that we didn't pick up...

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
... on the fact that he was dead?

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
I don't know.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
Somehow he was able to block the image...

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
... when he...

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
... send that signal to us.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
What are you doing?

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Just making sure he is what he appears to be.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
Charming.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Dead as a doornail.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
How did you know Neil?

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, he and I worked together on a project.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
I'm a professor of anthropology 
at Yale University.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
You're staring at me.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Sorry.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
It's just that Neil was...

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
... so obsessed with his work...

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
... it's hard to imagine him...

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
... taking time-out to get married.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
These rooms, they haven't been used...

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
... for quite a while.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
You know people used to come here...

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
...just to see this place from all over?

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
The Queen of England came here once.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
I took care of her myself.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
That's an interesting aroma.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
What is it?

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
A Korean dragon's blood.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
What are you doing?

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
I'm cleaning your etheric body.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
What?

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
It's for protecting.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Listen to me.
You are in great danger.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Do not go near the fireplace,
whatever you do.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
Why?

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
Don't go near the fireplace.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
I have to go.
I have work to do.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
This isn't gonna to be easy.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
There's my little darling.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
Hello, sweetheart.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
I bet you are starving to death.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
Got you a ??? dog.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
You can't save her, Alex.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Right this way.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
Pity about dear Neil.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
Were you friendly with him?

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
Not very.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
Sorry to hear that.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
What's wrong?

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Something happened in this elevator.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
Something...

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
What?

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
A man forcing a woman to have sex.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
What man?

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
What man?

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
It was Gallagher.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
That woman wasn't his wife.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
What is she talking about?

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Please, don't interfere.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
What is it?
She's experiencing the past.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
Tell me.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
It was horrible...

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
... what he did to her...

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Oh, god.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
Please don't bring up any of this...

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
... around Mrs. Gallagher.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
She's upset enough...

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
... as it is.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Wouldn't want to have disturbed Mrs. Gallagher.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Don't worry.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Oh my god, Frankie!
What?

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
This is a movie star bed.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Not now, Carlissa.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
No, really.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
Two famous movie stars...

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
... had a wild night in this bed.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
Come feel it.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Stop it!

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
This is business.
We're focusing on Gallagher...

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
... remember?

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
You know I can't help it, Frankie.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
I know, baby.
It's just that...

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
... I don't want you becoming distracted.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
We have to use your gifts...

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
... to find out what Gallagher was doing here.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Oh my god!

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
They did it right in this bed.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Who?

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
Clark Gable and Carole Lombard.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Clark Gable and...

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
... Carol Lombard.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
Hello.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Did everybody get settled in all right?

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
Yes, thank you.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
This hotel seems to have quite 
a history, Mrs. Gallagher.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
Yes, it does.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
It's been in my family 
since the turn of the century.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
My parents operated it till they died...

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
... a few years ago.
Thank you, Theresa.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Miss Megan...

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
We are just so curious to hear...

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
... about you and your...

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
... dear Gallagher.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
Well.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
I've met Neil when he was staying here...

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
... working on a project.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
We became friends...

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
... and when my parents died...

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
... he helped me through some rough times.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
Now, that doesn't sound like 
the Gallagher we all know.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
Anyway, it was something of a surprise to me...

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
... when he asked me to marry him.
I mean... I liked him a lot.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
He said he loved me...

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
... and he offered to help me run this hotel

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
Now, that sounds...

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
... like Gallagher.
He wanted something.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
So we got married.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
Two years ago next Friday.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
He had so many ideas for the hotel.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
He wanted to renovate it completely.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
So we shut it down.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
What about his work?

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
He didn't really tell me much about it.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
I knew it was important to him.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
I didn't want him to stop.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Seems like the first year 
of our marriage he spent...

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
... most of his time supervising 
construction all over the place.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
They really tore it apart.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Then...

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
One day he just stopped everything...

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
... and from the next year 
he spent almost every day...

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
... locked up with his work.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
I really didn't know what to do.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
I would've kicked that bastard out on his ass.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Dana...

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
If you have something to say...

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
... I wish you would say it to me.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
She likes to stir things up.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
Don't let her bother you.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
Now, Alex...

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
The lady has invited me to speak.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
I have a wealth of information about her...

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
...dear beloved Neil that 
I would love to share with her

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Sit down and shut up.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
Well, aren't we the excitable one this evening?

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
Miss Megan.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
There's a question that's 
been burning inside of me.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
Did it ever...

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
... pass through your sweet...

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
... innocent, little mind...

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
... that your husband possibly...

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
... married you for your money?

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Little bit of sauce and Dana becomes

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
... quite the cynic, doesn't she?

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm not a cynic, Frank.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
I prefer to think of myself as a...

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
... nasty bitch.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
That's enough, Dana.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
Fuck you, you Ivy League tard-ass.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
And who's kidding who.
We all know why we're here.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
So why continue the pitiful charade...

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
... of the grave widow?

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
The truth is, honey...

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
... your husband was...

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
... a despicable...

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
... greedy bastard.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
He screwed us...

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
... now we mean to even the score.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
Do I make myself clear?

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Perfectly.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
You're some piece of work.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
Did I say something?

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
I'm sorry.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She usually isn't like this.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm so confused.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
Who are you people?

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
Well...
Some would call us...

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
... magicians.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
To some degree, we all have 
unusual psychic powers.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
Your husband brought us together 
several years ago...

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
... to try to help in his research.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
He and Frank began to study in the ancient...

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
... Egyptian methods of the old.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
And they found evidence...

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
... that the Egyptians have 
developed a secret method...

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
... of giving life to inanimate figurines.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Then the secrets were passed on to...

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
... select few who knew and practiced magic.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
Dana there makes a living telling fortunes.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
She used her powers to help your husband...

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
... locate the last true alchemist...

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
... of the modern times...

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
... a famous puppet master in the twenties.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
And what about Carlissa?

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
Well, your husband brought her in because of...

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
... her skills in psychometry.
- Which means?

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
I mean... she can reconstruct...

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
... the emotional history of an object...

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
... by touch or feel.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Like what?

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
She could sit in a car...

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
...tell you who owns it...

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
... sit on a bed and tell you 
its entire history.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
Oh, I see.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
- What about you?
- What do you do?

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
- I dream.
- Everybody dreams.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
Sure, but not about things to come.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
It wouldn't kill you to
act like normal people.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
I may need a day off.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
Somebody there?

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
What happened?

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
She feinted.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
Look.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Is he alive?

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
No, he's dead.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
Believe me.
He's dead.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Starting tomorrow...

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
... we're going to tear this place apart.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
I think Andre Toulon's secret is right here.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
Doesn't make sense.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
If he found it...

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
... why kill himself?

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
And who's fooling around with the body?

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
I never did trust this son of a bitch.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
What's he up to?

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
Maybe it's Mrs. Gallagher 
who's up to something?

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
That wasn't a dream I had, was it?

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
I don't understand.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Who would do that?

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Well, we think it was Theresa.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
Theresa?

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
Where is Teresa?

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
We can't find her.
We looked all over.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
Take it easy.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
Why did you come here?

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
I had to.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
Why?

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
I had this dream and I came here...

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
... to make sure it didn't come true.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
Oh my god!

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
What's wrong?

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
Two women.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
Maybe.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
The Second World War.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
And?
Details.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
They spent their entire leave...

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
... in this tub.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
Listen, darling, as long you're going...

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
... to be fooling around in there...

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
... see if you can pick up on Neil Gallagher...

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
... and that young wife of his, of course.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Shut up.

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
Sweet dreams...

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
What are you doing, Frank?

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
Preparing for tonight's experiment.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
Suppose we found it, Frank...

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
... What Andre Toulon's discovered, I mean...

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
... What would you do with the power?

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
If you had it, I mean.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
Well, that's easy.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
I'd rule the world.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
Do you think she's pretty?

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
Gallagher's wife, I mean.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
Frank.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
Frank!

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Frank!

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
Frank...

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
Frank.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
Frank...

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
Yeah?

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
You scared the heart of me, you jerk.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
Come on, darling.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
I just wanted to get you into that
haunted house mood for tonight's work.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
What're you doing?

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
We're all in danger.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
He means to kill us all.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
Who does?

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
Gallagher.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
Honey, even the dead have their ways.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
Protection.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
Thanks.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
December eighth.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
1:46 AM.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
Researcher and principle psychometric subject...

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
... are about to embark on sexual 
experiment number 517A.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
Hopefully, we'll be opening up 
a channel to Neil Gallagher.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
The experiment will utilize...

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
... various sexual aids and...

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
... certain assorted apparatus.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
Descriptions to follow.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
Sidebar note to transcriber...

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
... file under personal documentation...

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
... and be sure to annotate the location.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
Are you ready?

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
Ready and willing.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
Promise you'll be gentle.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
I love it when you do that.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
God, I like this.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
No, no.
Not this time.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
You don't get to do anything
but what I want you to do.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Oh, great. That's just great.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
Yeah...

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
I think I'm gonna like this.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Perfect.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
A little life insurance from the white witch.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
Leroy, there's gonna be a lot of changes...

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
... in the next 24 hours.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
... and it's not going to be promising for you-know-who.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
This is going to be a long night and lonely night, sugar.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
I never did get used to those two.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
What are you... what are you doing?
Don't stop.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
My god.
What is it?

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
The door is open.
I think someone's in the room, Frank.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
Untie me, Carlissa.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
Come on, untie me.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
What the hell was that?

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
Frank!
What?

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
Carlissa, what are you doing?

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
God. Don't do this to me, Carlissa.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
Shhh. Quiet, Frank..

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
Carlissa...

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
It's a joke, right?

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
Carlissa, where are you?

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Carlissa, what's happened?

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
Carlissa, what're you doing?

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
Carlissa, you know I have no sense of humour.

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
You little minx.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
You connected with Gallagher, didn't you?

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
I'm ready for...

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
What are you going to do to me?

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
Must be one of those undisclosed 
sexual aids, huh, is it?

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
Good...

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
Carlissa, stop that!

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
Carlissa... you're hurting me!

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
Carlissa, stop it!

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
Oh, Man...

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
Come on, wear it out...

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
Give it a rest...

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
Please, no...

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
Hmmm? What's that?

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
Oh, I'm real happy you decided to come
on a trip with me.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
Yes I am.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Well, it would be an awful lonely trip
if you hadn't come along.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
What are you doing...

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
... sneaking around this time of night?

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
Well, Frank and Carlissa are trying
to rearrange the walls in their room...

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
...makes it hard to sleep.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
I know what you mean.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Would you like to come in for a little nightcap?

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
Thanks, but I'd rather do a little wandering.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
I was hoping we could do a little...

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
... rearranging of the walls ourselves.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
I don't think that would be a good idea, Dana.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
No?

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
No.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
I tried.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Goodnight.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
Sweet dreams.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
It's just me and you, Leroy.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
Well, I guess we'll just have 
to entertain each other...

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
... like we always do, Leroy.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
I know you don't like Alex very much,
but he's all right.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Now, you just sit down...

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
... and you stay like a good boy.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
Well, look who's here...

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
... if it isn't my dear old friend, Gallagher.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
Come to make a call?

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
Now, you can fool the others...

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
... but you don't fool me.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
I know what you're about.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
We put the dead to rest.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
He won't be bothering us anymore, Leroy.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Motherfucker!

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Shit...

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Alex!

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Wake up.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Alex!

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Yeah?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Just a second.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Alex...

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I want you to come with me.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I have something I want to show you.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Just...
Let me get my shoes.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Hurry.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I couldn't sleep.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Something about Neil's death kept on bothering me.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It never occurred to me before
that there was a connection between...

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
... the old puppet master's death and my husband...

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
... but after dinner, it began to make sense.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Neil used to spend hours up here.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I don't know what he was doing exactly, but...

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
... he never let me come up.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I thought it was strange.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Didn't really mind it.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I came up here earlier...

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
...and I found something in here.
Would you hold that, please?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I told you I wanna show you something.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You can't save her, Alex.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Stop!

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
What's happening, Alex?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Alex!

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Wake up!

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I want you to come with me.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
What for?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I have something to show you.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Yeah...

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Let me get my shoes.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Hurry.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I couldn't sleep.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Something about Neil's death was really bothering me.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
It never occurred to me that 
there was a connection between...

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
... the old puppet master's death and my husband's...

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
...but after dinner, it started to make sense.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Neil used to spend hours up here.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I don't know what he was doing exactly...

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
... but he never let me...
... never let you come up.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
You thought it was strange, but
you didn't really mind.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
How did you know?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Well, I'm kind of a magician, remember?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I came up here earlier tonight...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
... and I... I found something in here.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I was looking through Neil's books up here...

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
... and I started reading this one.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
This is Andre Toulon's diary.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Listen to this.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Today, I gave them life...

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
... using the ancient Egyptian rites of afterlife.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I know that like all my other children,
like my other puppets...

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
... they mirror the soul of their master.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
With me, they are harmless, but...

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
... I fear what they are capable of...

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
... if placed in the wrong hands.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Alex.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Alex, what is it? What's wrong?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Alex.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Alex, what is it?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Hello, Alex.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Bye, Alex.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Are you ok?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Alex.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Come on. Let's go.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
What is it?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Alex.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
They're in the dining-room.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Oh my god.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
We have to get out of here.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
You're not leaving on my account, are you?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
You're dead.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Yes.
I am.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I put a gun in my mouth 
and blew away my vast knowledge.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
And here I am.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Dead.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Megan doesn't understand the metaphysics of it, Alex.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Will you explain it to her, please?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
What's the matter, Alex?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
You're not getting slow on me, are you?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Let me explain.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Metaphysically speaking...

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
... I killed myself...

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
... and, using the techniques of the old puppet master...

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
... I brought myself back to life.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Why?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
That's easy.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I wanna live forever.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
All life eventually ends in death...

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
... but, for me, there is no end now.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
You mean... no natural end.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Alex...

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
... don't even entertain the thought.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It would take the total destruction of this body...

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
... something that you're not capable of.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I'm much stronger now...

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
... than I ever was in life.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Why did you kill them?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Why?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Because we are all joined by our thoughts...

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
... and sooner or later one of you would have learned...

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
... that I have discovered Toulon's secrets.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I had to bring you here.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Besides...

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I'm tired of experimenting with silly, little...

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
... wooden puppets.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Actually, I wasn't...

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
... the first human experiment.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
The first experiment was on her parents.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It was a stroke of luck, actually.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I followed the trail of the old puppet master...

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
... to this hotel.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I was always quick with the women.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Right, Alex?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And Megan, ah...
She was so young.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
So east to win over.
No...

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Parents...

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
... that's another story.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I had no choice...

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
... but to kill them.
It was a small price to pay...

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
... to live forever.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Bastard!

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
What the hell are you looking at?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Don't touch the body.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
It's time to die, Alex...

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Stop it!
... so you can live forever.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Stop!

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Stop it!

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
What the hell do you think you're doing?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Open that door you fucking...

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
... little cretin...

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
...or I'll chop you into firewood.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
You brainless little pinhead.
Get out of my way.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Open this fucking door!

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
What the hell do you think you're doing?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Oh, no, you don't.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I'm the master...

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
... and you're the puppet.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I'll get you, Alex.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Why...

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
No...

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
No, no, stop!

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
No!

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
No!
Stop!

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Stop!

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Stop!

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Well, my cab's waiting...

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
You take care of yourself.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Yeah, I will... You too.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
If you ever get to the East, give me a call.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You have a good trip.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Good dog, Leroy.
