00:12.245 --> 00:15.214
You know, Eric, I'm really happy
with our relationship right now.

00:15.281 --> 00:19.308
Yeah, me too. It's like we're way past
the ''broken up and miserable'' stage...

00:19.386 --> 00:23.345
and we're back in the
''having sex again'' stage, so-

00:24.457 --> 00:27.119
Yeah. Thumbs up
from this end too. Yeah.

00:27.193 --> 00:31.095
I'm serious.
I mean, we've been through a lot...

00:31.164 --> 00:33.928
and even though some of it
wasn't exactly fun-

00:34.000 --> 00:37.458
I mean, it was worth it, because now
we know that we can handle anything.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.097
And we don't freak out
about the little stuff.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.505
Right.

00:42.575 --> 00:46.033
Like that time we got in that big fight
because I ran over your cat.

00:48.815 --> 00:51.511
- That wasn't little stuff. I really loved that cat.
- Yeah. No.

00:51.584 --> 00:56.044
Yeah. No, I know.
I- I mean, uh, the cat was little.

00:58.358 --> 01:03.295
Anyway, when you came to California,
I knew you were the one.

01:03.363 --> 01:06.457
So I got you a gift to symbolize
how far we've come.

01:06.533 --> 01:10.799
Is it, like, one of those gifts
that women get for men...

01:10.870 --> 01:12.963
but they actually wear themselves?

01:16.176 --> 01:18.110
Here.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.845
- ( Exhales )
- It's a ring.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.215
Yeah.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.516
And I'm a man.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.523
Yeah.
It's a man-ring.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.128
A man-ring.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.826
Yea!

02:18.404 --> 02:20.338
Morning.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.738
What the hell's that thing
on your finger?

02:25.512 --> 02:27.776
This is my new man-ring.

02:29.949 --> 02:32.941
Donna got it for me,
so I'll feel right at home...

02:33.019 --> 02:35.715
when the gypsies come to town.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.121
Well, take it off. You look like
some kind of fruity magician.

02:41.127 --> 02:44.358
Well, I think it's sweet.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.364
I can enjoy these things now...

02:46.432 --> 02:49.424
because I am not gonna let
menopause get me down.

02:49.502 --> 02:55.270
Mm-mmm. No depression, night sweats,
or sudden mood swings for me.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.003
Well, I guess that's
starting today, huh?

03:01.814 --> 03:04.408
'Cause last night,
you hit the trifecta there.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.713
Well, I just refuse to be sad...

03:09.789 --> 03:11.848
about the fact that I'm never
gonna have another baby.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.916
I don't need another baby.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.928
I got a lot to look forward to.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.491
Like picking out my casket.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.704
- Oh, Kitty.
- I-

03:25.772 --> 03:28.764
- It's okay.
- ( Sobbing )

03:28.841 --> 03:31.867
You've still got Eric.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.641
He's sort of a baby.

03:35.648 --> 03:38.776
I'll make him cry if you want.

03:42.755 --> 03:46.156
- Man, that is one big-ass ring!
- <i>( Stereo:Rock )</i>

03:47.427 --> 03:50.260
Hey, maybe people'll think
you won the Super Bowl.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.457
Nah.
Nobody'd believe that.

03:54.534 --> 03:58.368
But he could be the sick little kid
the whole team rallies around.

04:03.109 --> 04:05.270
Well, guys.
Wish me luck. Today...

04:05.345 --> 04:09.042
I have a job interview at
the Department of Motor Vehicles.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.910
All right.
Good luck, man.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.977
Oh, Eric.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.257
What a glorious man-ring.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.499
See, I told you to accessorize...

04:28.568 --> 04:32.095
and you finally listened, huh?

04:32.171 --> 04:34.230
- Man, you like it?
- Yeah. What's not to like?

04:34.307 --> 04:37.140
It's hypnotic.
It looks like he has superpowers.

04:38.878 --> 04:43.338
Man, I'd like to see the lame-o superhero
that had to wear that ring.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.093
Okay, super pals...

04:55.161 --> 04:59.188
I need a danger alert status report.

04:59.265 --> 05:02.200
My sensors indicate...

05:02.268 --> 05:05.669
peace and quiet
throughout the universe.

05:08.341 --> 05:12.141
I think the oceans are secure, but I cannot
check for another 45 minutes.

05:12.211 --> 05:15.510
Because... I just ate.

05:15.581 --> 05:17.572
<i>( Spaceship Door Beeps )</i>

05:19.886 --> 05:22.548
- Hi, guys.
- No.

05:22.622 --> 05:26.683
You've been brainwashed and forced
to wear this hideously ugly ring!

05:26.759 --> 05:29.626
Actually, it's a gift.
From me.

05:29.696 --> 05:32.688
Form of- the worst gift ever.

05:32.765 --> 05:37.134
Shape of-
uh, hope you kept the receipt.

05:37.203 --> 05:41.162
- ( Beeping )
- Oh, no! Alien zombies are attacking the Earth.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.107
- Let's swing into action, gang.
- Hang on a second!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.907
We're still on this ring.

05:46.979 --> 05:49.675
Are you sure it's not
an evil alien artifact?

05:49.749 --> 05:52.013
I got it at the mall.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.614
Greetings, super dumb-asses.

05:57.690 --> 06:01.456
Oh, no!
It's Dr. Bald.

06:01.527 --> 06:06.328
Any minute now,
my army of alien zombies will be inva-

06:07.333 --> 06:10.598
Good Lord!
That is an ugly ring!

06:12.572 --> 06:15.769
Hey, alien zombies,
get a load of that ring!

06:15.842 --> 06:19.073
( All Laughing )

06:23.049 --> 06:27.179
- All right. That's it. This thing's comin' off.
- Oh, whoa! Be careful, man.

06:27.253 --> 06:31.121
You drop something that big and heavy,
it'll throw off the Earth's rotation.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.886
We'll all go crashing into the sun.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.157
Way to use science in a <i>burn.</i>

06:40.166 --> 06:44.432
- <i>( Stereo:Rock )</i>
- Donna, guess who hates the ring you got him?

06:44.504 --> 06:47.496
Eric hates the ring?

06:47.573 --> 06:50.565
- He told me he loved it.
- Well. See...

06:50.643 --> 06:53.703
Eric told Steven
that the ring was so ugly...

06:53.780 --> 06:57.216
that the Elephant Man wears it
to distract people from his face.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.311
That ring is beautiful.

07:02.388 --> 07:05.755
You know, what's ugly
is his bony little finger.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.352
Hey. You know what?
If he can't appreciate it...

07:10.430 --> 07:13.092
let's just take it back
and buy me somethin' pretty.

07:15.535 --> 07:18.299
According to your application,
your last job...

07:18.371 --> 07:20.430
was as Dancer Number Three...

07:20.506 --> 07:23.441
in the school production
of <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

07:25.545 --> 07:28.343
Yes. It was magical.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.846
( Quoting Lyric )

07:34.020 --> 07:36.887
Uh-huh. I'm afraid
your theater experience...

07:36.956 --> 07:40.983
doesn't really apply to working here
at the D.M.V.

07:41.060 --> 07:45.360
But, Nina, what is the D.M.V. really,
if not one big stage?

07:45.431 --> 07:50.459
The D.M.V. is the Department
of Motor Vehicles. It is not a stage.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.096
Ah, but in a way,
they're very similar.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.265
- No, they're not.
- Oh, but really, they are.

07:55.341 --> 07:57.536
- No, they're not.
- Okay.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.744
- They are.
- No, they're not!

08:04.817 --> 08:07.752
I'm just gonna put down
no prior experience.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.482
Fair enough.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.218
Ah, but you haven't asked me
about my special skills yet.

08:14.861 --> 08:20.094
Well, I really don't see how
a fondness for pie is relevant.

08:23.302 --> 08:27.830
But, Nina, what is the D.M.V. really,
if not one big pie shop?

08:30.810 --> 08:34.371
( Clicking )

08:35.381 --> 08:38.043
( Clicking )

08:39.217 --> 08:42.153
Great.
Clicker's on the fritz.

08:42.221 --> 08:45.156
All I want to do is see the end of
<i>Guiding Light,</i> and it won't click.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.215
- ( Clicking )
- Click, damn it! Click!

08:50.796 --> 08:52.730
Kitty?

08:52.798 --> 08:55.926
I think your lady problem
is acting up again.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.469
It jus- It just won't click,
that's all.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.599
It's supposed to click, Red.
It's a clicker. That's what it does.

09:02.675 --> 09:06.509
Okay.
Let's get you to bed.

09:06.579 --> 09:10.447
Okay, you guys? Uh, very important. Donna's
coming over, and I lost the ring she gave me.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.746
- I thought I had it in the basement.
- Eric, please!

09:12.818 --> 09:15.412
Your mother is having a breakdown.

09:15.488 --> 09:20.687
No. The only thing having a breakdown
around here is the clicker!

09:20.760 --> 09:25.288
Why won't it click, Red?
Nothing loves me!

09:28.801 --> 09:31.429
Okay, Eric.
Jackie just told me...

09:31.504 --> 09:33.665
that Hyde told her
that you hate the ring.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.934
Uh-oh.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.738
I happen to think it's beautiful.

09:38.811 --> 09:42.212
Besides, that is what
a man-ring looks like.

09:42.281 --> 09:47.218
Well, you know, Donna, maybe I'm just not
a man-ring kind of guy.

09:47.286 --> 09:52.656
I mean, I like man-pants
and man-shirts.

09:52.725 --> 09:56.525
Eric, you could've just told me
you didn't like it when I gave it to you.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.530
You know what? Just-
Just give it back.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.964
I absolutely will...

10:01.033 --> 10:04.400
just as soon as I find it.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.461
What?

10:06.539 --> 10:08.666
How could you lose it?

10:08.741 --> 10:10.675
I told you it was a symbol...

10:10.743 --> 10:14.804
of our loving freakin' relationship!

10:14.880 --> 10:17.212
And my losing it is a symbol...

10:17.283 --> 10:21.777
of how much I love
and... respect you?

10:23.255 --> 10:27.419
I need cold compresses
and a Bloody Mary. Quick!

10:28.794 --> 10:32.195
Your mother is talking about
adopting a communist orphan.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.495
Now move.
I need help, damn it!

10:43.655 --> 10:45.646
( Stereo: Rock )

10:45.724 --> 10:50.127
I don't... understand.
How could I lose a 25-pound ring?

10:51.630 --> 10:56.567
I once lost a six-foot-long
rubber chili dog.

10:56.635 --> 10:58.626
And I still haven't found it.

10:58.704 --> 11:00.638
It's just gone!

11:00.706 --> 11:03.402
You know what, Hyde?
This whole thing's your fault.

11:03.475 --> 11:05.636
You're the one who told Jackie
I didn't like the ring.

11:05.711 --> 11:08.646
Hyde stabbed you in the back?

11:08.714 --> 11:11.182
No. He wouldn't do
anything like that.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.686
Like he didn't stealJackie
from me. Oh, wait a minute!

11:15.687 --> 11:18.383
Look, man.
I told her not to tell.

11:18.457 --> 11:20.186
Yeah. And I told <i>you</i> not to tell.

11:20.259 --> 11:23.194
You and Jackie are gossiping now?

11:23.262 --> 11:27.358
You know, the more you two go out,
the more like each other you get.

11:27.432 --> 11:30.993
Yeah. Who knows what you and your little
girlfriend are gonna be like in a couple months.

11:31.069 --> 11:33.867

Go team!

11:37.276 --> 11:39.744
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo! Number one! Yeah!

11:42.181 --> 11:44.672
Jackie? I heard
the best piece of gossip.

11:44.750 --> 11:47.082
Eric Forman doesn't have
any school spirit.

11:47.152 --> 11:50.121
( Gasps )
I'm tellin' everyone!

11:50.189 --> 11:53.818
- Too late. I already did.
- ( Squeals )

11:54.993 --> 11:57.188
First of all,
Jackie is not my girlfriend.

11:57.262 --> 12:00.026
And second of all, I'm not the only one
who spills stuff around here.

12:00.098 --> 12:04.592
Yeah. You're right. Hey, Kelso.
Hyde watches <i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>

12:08.907 --> 12:12.172
<i>Little House on the Prairie?</i>

12:12.244 --> 12:14.337
It reminds me of a simpler time.

12:21.420 --> 12:26.357
How could Eric lose that ring? And more
importantly, how could he think it was ugly?

12:26.425 --> 12:30.191
It's got real nugget-gold plating
and the abalone is inlaid.

12:31.863 --> 12:36.732
If you were my girlfriend,
I would be proud to wear that ring.

12:36.802 --> 12:40.203
Heck, I'd wear it if you just wanted
to fool around a little.

12:40.272 --> 12:43.764
Get my drift, Big ''D''?
( Clicks Tongue, Groans )

12:45.310 --> 12:48.871
All I know is, you guys better watch
what you say around here.

12:48.947 --> 12:53.475
Some people can't be trusted because
they have a great, big mouth!Jackie!

12:54.620 --> 12:56.747
How could you say that?
My mouth...

12:56.822 --> 12:59.655
is in perfect proportion
to the rest of my face.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.922
Plenty of classy men wear rings.

13:03.996 --> 13:07.454
Wayne Newton.
The pope.

13:07.532 --> 13:10.330
My Uncle Carmine from Hoboken.

13:10.402 --> 13:13.269
You lose his ring,
you wake up in a Dumpster.

13:13.338 --> 13:15.329
And that's just a warning!

13:17.309 --> 13:20.767
Now I think that's all the questions
I have about your application.

13:20.846 --> 13:23.906
Okay, but one thing
my application doesn't say...

13:23.982 --> 13:26.678
is how much I would apply
myself to the job here.

13:29.121 --> 13:32.113
I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop making puns now.

13:33.892 --> 13:37.123
I really don't think
this is going to work out, so-

13:37.195 --> 13:38.787
( Gasps )

13:40.532 --> 13:44.229
Wow! That is a gorgeous man-ring.

13:44.303 --> 13:49.036
You know, wearing a ring this big
shows a lot of confidence.

13:49.107 --> 13:52.838
Well, I do feel like a king
when I wear it.

13:54.579 --> 13:58.640
And, you know, what is the D.M.V. really,
if not one big kingdom?

14:01.853 --> 14:03.787
You know what?

14:03.855 --> 14:06.187
You're stubborn, under qualified...

14:06.258 --> 14:08.726
and you barely speak English.

14:10.495 --> 14:12.759
Welcome to the D.M.V.

14:18.970 --> 14:21.837
Wait a minute. You're mad at me
for telling Donna a secret?

14:21.907 --> 14:25.775
Steven, I tell secrets.
It's who I am.

14:25.844 --> 14:29.302
Look. All I'm sayin' is,
if you're gonna be my girlfriend...

14:29.381 --> 14:33.044
you can't go runnin' around, shootin' off
your big, fat, cheerleader mouth.

14:34.453 --> 14:37.081
You just called me your girlfriend.

14:37.155 --> 14:39.146
No, I didn't.

14:39.224 --> 14:41.556
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

14:41.626 --> 14:43.116
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

14:43.195 --> 14:46.221
Yes, you did, and shut up.
You're ruining it!

14:46.298 --> 14:49.756
Okay, now listen to me.

14:49.835 --> 14:53.396
I'll keep my mouth shut,
if you admit that I'm your girlfriend.

14:55.540 --> 14:58.668
No, the price is too high.

14:58.744 --> 15:03.613
Okay, fine. You know what?
I'm telling everybody everything anyways.

15:03.682 --> 15:07.345
Starting with the fact that you
called me your girlfriend.

15:07.419 --> 15:10.616
You're blackmailing me?

15:10.689 --> 15:13.317
You're coming along nicely.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.430
Good news.
I got the job.

15:23.502 --> 15:26.369
What the hell is that
on your finger?

15:28.673 --> 15:31.767
Oh, it's chocolate and coconut.

15:31.843 --> 15:34.471
I can't believe you took my ring.

15:34.546 --> 15:36.878
Oh.

15:36.948 --> 15:39.815
Yes.
I took it.

15:39.885 --> 15:42.217
I took it, and I'm proud.

15:43.488 --> 15:46.889
You don't deserve
something this beautiful.

15:46.958 --> 15:50.052
You have a girlfriend.
You have a ring. I have nothing!

15:56.101 --> 15:59.537
Well, you-you have a job.

15:59.604 --> 16:01.731
Well, that's true.
Good for me.

16:06.278 --> 16:10.112
You guys, look at this thing.
God, what was Donna thinking?

16:10.182 --> 16:13.310
Forman, you gotta expect this.
I mean, look at her dad.

16:16.221 --> 16:19.349
The apple doesn't fall
far from the Bob.

16:21.460 --> 16:25.123
Now, this ring's
a wolf attackin' a zebra.

16:25.197 --> 16:28.325
This one's a zebra attackin' a wolf.

16:28.400 --> 16:33.064
And in this one,
they're finally friends.

16:35.607 --> 16:39.771
Hey, there. Hi, there.
Ho, there. Let's go.

16:39.845 --> 16:42.643
I'm not goin' to the game
with you in that jacket, Bob.

16:48.053 --> 16:50.851
I'm not goin' to the game, Bob.

16:52.757 --> 16:56.557
My God, she never had a chance.

16:56.628 --> 17:01.224
Hyde, my girlfriend has bad taste.

17:01.299 --> 17:04.564
Well, she is dating you.

17:09.140 --> 17:12.439
Ah, a good burn, Fez.

17:12.511 --> 17:16.914
And that ring is only the beginning, man.
I can see it now.

17:19.451 --> 17:22.887
Eric, you look so foxy.

17:22.954 --> 17:26.412
Hey, there. Hi, there.
Ho, there.

17:31.563 --> 17:33.497
Ta-da!

17:33.565 --> 17:36.227
Look what I found.
And I didn't even lose it. Fez took it.

17:36.301 --> 17:40.567
So, basically, you got mad at me
for being a victim of robbery.

17:42.874 --> 17:45.741
Okay.

17:45.810 --> 17:48.608
Apologetic look accepted.

17:48.680 --> 17:53.447
Eric, I got mad at you for not being honest,
and that hasn't changed.

17:53.518 --> 17:56.851
Really?
Huh, I thought it might've.

17:56.922 --> 18:00.585
I gave you the ring as a symbol of how far
we've come in our relationship.

18:00.659 --> 18:04.060
And if you can't be honest,
then you shouldn't be wearing that ring at all.

18:06.364 --> 18:09.094
Okay. You want me to be honest?

18:09.167 --> 18:12.034
Okay.
I kind of think...

18:12.103 --> 18:16.904
that you have bad taste.

18:16.975 --> 18:19.307
What?
I do not!

18:19.377 --> 18:23.177
Okay. Well, then, tell me
what you think of this room-

18:23.248 --> 18:26.149
this turquoise-and-chrome
disaster of a room.

18:29.454 --> 18:33.322
I think it's classy
and sophisticated.

18:33.391 --> 18:36.485
You know, maybe you're the one
who has bad taste. In fact-

18:36.561 --> 18:40.292
Why don't you tell me about
this pea-soup-colored chair?

18:43.068 --> 18:46.162
I think it's comfortable and soothing,
just like pea soup.

18:47.472 --> 18:49.463
Well, I think this whole room...

18:49.541 --> 18:52.032
is a great example of bad taste.

18:56.247 --> 18:59.648
- Excuse me?
- Uh, Mrs. Forman.

18:59.718 --> 19:03.586
I have spent years picking
every item in this room...

19:03.655 --> 19:06.317
so that I would be surrounded
by the things I love...

19:06.391 --> 19:10.122
and the people I thought loved me.

19:10.195 --> 19:13.130
Hey, Kitty?
How about a nap?

19:13.198 --> 19:17.601
And you. Have you fixed
the damn clicker yet?

19:17.669 --> 19:21.298
What good is a clicker
if it won't click?

19:31.583 --> 19:34.984
Oh, my goodness.
I am flying right off the handle.

19:35.053 --> 19:37.044
( Laughing )

19:40.191 --> 19:43.752
Seems to me you're
just as pleasant as always.

19:43.828 --> 19:46.956
Ooh, that is sweet.
Oh.

19:47.032 --> 19:49.933
I think I'd like to take a nap now.

19:53.538 --> 19:56.132
Wha- Did you see that?

19:56.207 --> 19:58.266
I told you the truth,
and we got into a fight.

19:58.343 --> 20:03.212
My dad told my mom she's pleasant-
a whopper of a lie-

20:03.281 --> 20:05.875
and they've been married 1 50 years.

20:05.950 --> 20:09.909
I don't care. I want you to tell me
the truth all the time.

20:09.988 --> 20:12.183
No. No, you don't.

20:12.257 --> 20:15.021
It's like when women ask...

20:15.093 --> 20:17.584
whether or not their outfit
makes them look fat.

20:17.662 --> 20:19.926
How many men tell them
they look fat? Zero.

20:19.998 --> 20:23.900
How many women look fat?
Not zero.

20:25.737 --> 20:27.671
That is totally different.

20:27.739 --> 20:31.607
No, Donna.
No, it isn't.

20:31.676 --> 20:35.271
Look, how could I look you in the eye
and tell you that I don't like the ring...

20:35.346 --> 20:38.179
when I love you so much?

20:40.919 --> 20:43.114
I guess I know what you mean.

20:43.188 --> 20:46.180
It's like when you
wrote me that song.

20:49.294 --> 20:51.353
Wait.
You love that song.

20:51.429 --> 20:53.897
Of course I do.

21:00.939 --> 21:05.433
You know what?
We are really bad with rings.

21:06.945 --> 21:09.311
Yeah. If we ever get married,
we should just exchange, like...

21:09.380 --> 21:12.042
buckets of chicken.

21:13.718 --> 21:17.154
Or, uh, I- I could
write you another song.

21:17.222 --> 21:20.783
- Oh. I'm fine with chicken.
- Okay.

21:25.663 --> 21:27.858
Does this outfit
make my butt look fat?

21:27.932 --> 21:30.765
No.
You look super.

21:32.103 --> 21:34.367
So, uh.
Wonder Boy and I...

21:34.439 --> 21:37.306
are thinking about
movin' in together.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.343
My parents are gonna freak!

21:41.279 --> 21:44.771
- You think your parents are gonna freak?
- Yeah, we're twins.

21:46.885 --> 21:50.412
It really hurts my feelings
that you call me Dr. Bald.

21:50.488 --> 21:53.480
Just because I'm evil doesn't mean I don't cry.

21:53.558 --> 21:55.492
Super jerks!
