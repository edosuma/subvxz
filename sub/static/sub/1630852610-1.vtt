Maybe it's the ranchers.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.430
<i>My name's Harry.</i>

07:54.474 --> 07:57.302
My dad is an actor
in movies and TV.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.783
Let's go.
Hey!

07:59.827 --> 08:01.089
- Hey, man, I'm Austin.
- Harry.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.612
Austin.
Nice to meet you, man.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.048
Easy there.
You been working out or what?

08:04.092 --> 08:06.311
- Sorry, dude.
- Did you drive yourself?

08:06.355 --> 08:07.617
Yeah, 15 hours.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.227
Wait.
Why?

08:09.271 --> 08:10.533
I'm afraid of airplanes.

08:10.577 --> 08:11.621
Oh.
- Aw.

08:11.665 --> 08:12.970
There's, like,
mechanical issues

08:13.014 --> 08:14.798
that can happen
with an aircraft.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.974
There is a percent of a chance

08:17.018 --> 08:18.889
that the wing
could snap off.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.849
Most aircraft crashes
are from pilot error.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.633
Disgusting to be
in an enclosed space.

08:23.677 --> 08:26.506
99.9% of people survive--

08:26.549 --> 08:28.725
Uh, I stopped at a hotel
on the way.

08:28.769 --> 08:30.858
How do I know 50 people
that have died?

08:30.901 --> 08:34.731
I don't, but I'm--
I just think that--that, um--

08:34.775 --> 08:37.734
what was your question?

08:37.778 --> 08:39.649
So is anybody gonna
bring this up?

08:39.693 --> 08:41.390
Like, who are your parents?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.348
Uh, Ryan Seacrest is my dad.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.393
- Oh, my God.
- No way.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.656
- That's your dad?
- No way.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.005
Wait.
He has kids?

08:49.920 --> 08:52.662
No, I'm just kidding.

08:52.706 --> 08:53.837
Billy Bob Thornton.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.144
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, awesome.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.450
My dad won an Oscar
for "Sling Blade."

08:58.494 --> 09:01.018
<i>He did "Monster's Ball"</i> <i>
with Halle Berry.</i>

09:01.062 --> 09:03.325
"Tombstone," "Armageddon,"
"Bad Santa."

09:03.368 --> 09:06.676
My dad is Ray Parker, Jr.
He sung "Ghostbusters."

09:06.720 --> 09:08.765
My mom is Pat Benatar.

09:08.809 --> 09:09.853
- Wow.
- No way.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.203
Pat Benatar is a legend.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.553
<i>I do pop rock music,</i>

09:13.596 --> 09:16.860
so I cannot even believe
I'm meeting her daughter.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.689
My dad is David Hasselhoff.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.474
- My dad's Eazy-E.
- Let's go!

09:22.518 --> 09:24.651
- Let's go.
- Whoo!

09:24.694 --> 09:26.304
My dad's Martin Lawrence.

09:26.348 --> 09:27.697
- No way.
- Yeah.

09:27.741 --> 09:28.872
My dad is Badass Billy Gunn.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.613
He's a WWE Hall of Famer.
- Aye!

09:30.657 --> 09:32.963
- My dad is Shaquille O'Neal.
- Aye!

09:36.445 --> 09:37.620
What?

09:37.664 --> 09:39.056
- At AEW.
- Oh, AEW.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.667
Yeah!

09:40.710 --> 09:43.104
A week prior to coming
to the ranch,

09:43.147 --> 09:46.281
I had to hit his dad over the
back with a chair in wrestling.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.720
He turned around, grabbed me,
and went boom!

09:51.939 --> 09:54.115
P.S., by the way,
he beat me up really bad.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.119
What are we supposed
to do here, like?

09:58.162 --> 09:59.773
Well, where's the ranch
is what I want to know.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.035
The ranchers better not
have us walk.

10:01.078 --> 10:02.732
I'm not with that walk at all.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.212
Oh, man.
What'd we get ourselves into?

10:04.255 --> 10:05.430
- I don't know.
- Here it is.

10:05.474 --> 10:06.606
Look.
- Where?

10:06.649 --> 10:08.477
I told you the wagon
was coming.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.918
We're on that Wells Fargo.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.181
Uber carriage, baby.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.574
Whoo!

10:18.618 --> 10:20.097
Hi.
Hi.

10:20.141 --> 10:23.361
I can tell you're all
dressed for ranch work.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.627
I'm Anne, everybody.
Hi, Anne.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.280
I'm Erin.
Hi.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.414
Anne and I, we're ranch hands
on Saddleback Ranch.

10:32.457 --> 10:33.676
<i>There's definitely</i> <i>
a lot of hard work</i>

10:33.720 --> 10:35.243
<i>to be done on a ranch.</i>

10:35.286 --> 10:37.288
You're gonna be working
all the time, it feels like.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.639
So you guys are gonna have
to load some of your stuff.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.076
- Okay.
- Whoo!

10:42.119 --> 10:44.121
Does everybody have
good shoes on?

10:44.165 --> 10:45.775
Wait, we're--
we're walking?

10:45.819 --> 10:47.734
Well, if we can't make it up
the hill with all this stuff.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.474
Can we ride the horse up?

10:49.518 --> 10:51.781
These kids definitely look
like they're from the city.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.043
<i>It's a lot of luggage.</i>

10:53.087 --> 10:56.351
<i>Their wardrobe</i> <i>
and their footwear.</i>

10:56.394 --> 10:57.700
They don't know anything.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.702
Wait, walking?
What you mean walking?

10:59.746 --> 11:01.182
Wait, was this a joke or no?

11:01.225 --> 11:03.488
<i>I'm worried that some</i> <i>
of them might not make it.</i>

11:03.532 --> 11:05.708
<i>I feel like I definitely will</i> <i>
have my work cut out for me.</i>

11:07.057 --> 11:08.189
I don't know
whose bag this is,

11:08.232 --> 11:09.712
but I'm gonna sit on it, y'all,

11:09.756 --> 11:11.366
far away from the horse butt.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.719
<i>[echoing]</i> <i>
Mom?</i>

11:18.025 --> 11:19.940
I don't like pigs.
They're nasty, man.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.637
Do they bite?
- They do.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.682
Oh, no.

11:24.553 --> 11:25.946
Oh!

11:25.989 --> 11:27.817
- Oh, [bleep]!
- That's poop.

11:27.861 --> 11:28.992
Ew.

11:29.036 --> 11:29.993
Look at all that

11:30.037 --> 11:31.603
Sheering sheep is disgusting.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.743
We're gonna go
to the other side of that hill.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.441
So you guys live
on the ranch full-time?

11:43.485 --> 11:45.095
- We do too, now.
- We do too, now?

11:45.139 --> 11:47.576
Yeah!
All the new ranch hands.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.274
So what time do you guys
wake up in the morning

11:50.318 --> 11:51.275
to get the ranch going?

11:51.319 --> 11:52.363
We'll be starting chores

11:52.407 --> 11:53.756
about 7:00-7:30.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.324
- Oh, my gosh.
- What did you think

11:56.367 --> 11:58.065
that being on a ranch
is all about?

11:58.108 --> 12:00.154
We're in--we're in it, 100%.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.898
Is that it?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.595

12:35.102 --> 12:37.017
- Poker!
- Hell yeah.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.670
No, This is way better than
what I was thinking, for sure.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.150
I feel a whole
lot better now.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.412
Yeah, I could do--
I could do this.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.241
Hey, where are we sleeping?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.287
I'm thinking it's up here.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.246
Oh, nice.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.987
Wait, are we all
sleeping together?

12:52.336 --> 12:53.990
Oh, we're literally
all sleeping together.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.384
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

12:56.427 --> 12:57.820
How are you gonna fit
in this bed?

12:57.864 --> 12:58.908
I feel like I'm gonna
be over here.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.214
Stop it.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.650

Wait.
Oh, we do have bunk beds?

- We're getting comfy.
- Yeah.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.573
Yo, I can't fit on this.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.574
That's what I was
thinking too.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.489
Yo, I can't fit on this.

I'm sure we can sleep
on the couch.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.585
I was about to say
I'm going to the couch.

13:23.628 --> 13:26.109
If it collapses, I ain't
going--I ain't going down.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.068
I've never slept in a room
with seven other people,

13:28.111 --> 13:30.200
especially in bunkbeds, ever.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.332

- You better claim this

13:33.334 --> 13:34.683
You like the bottom?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.424
I don't know, I've never
really done this before.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.382
- Me neither.
- I like the top,

13:38.426 --> 13:40.689
because I feel like
I'm claustrophobic.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.125

Hey, guys.
Welcome to the ranch.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.822
My name is Jerad.
- My name is Justin.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.608
And we're the owners
of this ranch.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.176
<i>Saddleback Ranch</i> <i>

15:18.700 --> 15:20.223

15:20.267 --> 15:22.312
- Wow.
- You have a lot of land.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.097
Lot of work.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.882
<i>The biggest part</i> <i>
of our ranch is cattle.</i>

15:26.926 --> 15:29.015
<i>We run 2,000 head</i> <i>

experience the ranching life.

when COVID hit us,

15:43.855 --> 15:45.901
our tourism business shut down.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.992
It's taken a hit on our income
that supports our families.

For real, like, there's
just so many videos out there

24:34.081 --> 24:35.517
<i>of birds doing weird stuff</i> <i>
where they just</i>

24:35.561 --> 24:37.519
<i>don't seem like real animals.</i>

24:37.563 --> 24:39.739
Like, the government
made them or something,

24:39.782 --> 24:41.523
so I don't really
with birds.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.004
We're gonna grab pig food,
you guys.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.701
Can I get a volunteer?

24:45.745 --> 24:47.137
I'm gonna hang off
on the pigs, you heard me?

24:47.181 --> 24:48.878
'Cause, like,
I ain't trying to get in there.

24:48.922 --> 24:52.926
These guys just flap open.
Dump one on each side.

24:52.969 --> 24:54.754
So Myles,
you'll do the other one.

24:54.797 --> 24:58.540
If shavings get in here,
we'll need to scoop 'em out.

24:58.584 --> 24:59.889
- Okay.
- Yep.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.590
Getting up in the morning,
and then going and doing

25:04.633 --> 25:07.244
<i>these hard labor chores</i> <i>
is kind of insane.</i>

25:07.288 --> 25:09.638
<i>I've never done any of this</i> <i>
literally, in my life.</i>

25:09.682 --> 25:11.858
It's exhausting already.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.381
- I don't like pigs.
- You good, Harry?

25:13.424 --> 25:15.992
They're nasty, dude.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.561
You got to push 'em.
They'll push you.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.302
They're gonna nibble on you.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.782
- Do they bite?
- They do.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.784
Okay.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.089
<i>Pigs have always</i> <i>
grossed me out.</i>

25:26.133 --> 25:28.091
Uh!

25:28.135 --> 25:29.789
Oh, no.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.530
They sleep in all day

25:31.573 --> 25:34.924
and walk in puddles of

25:39.102 --> 25:42.018
<i>I hate these filthy,</i> <i>
disgusting pigs.</i>

25:42.062 --> 25:44.107
That's not anything
anyone should have

25:44.151 --> 25:45.456
to touch, do, or look at.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.157
<i>I'm kind of having</i> <i>
second thoughts of being here.</i>

25:50.200 --> 25:52.159
Oh, God.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.860
You're gonna reach down here

25:57.904 --> 25:59.514
and pull any off there.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.994
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

26:02.648 --> 26:04.301
It's nasty

26:04.345 --> 26:05.302
Oh, my God!

26:12.005 --> 26:13.441
<i>This is only the first day.</i>

26:13.484 --> 26:15.617
<i>I've done some pretty nasty</i> <i>
in my day,</i>

26:15.661 --> 26:17.750
but those pigs...

26:17.793 --> 26:18.968
they were nasty.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.189
Whoo!

26:22.232 --> 26:23.233
Hey, guys.
Welcome.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.452
- What's up?
- Hello.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.628
How was y'all's chores
this morning?

26:26.672 --> 26:29.283
- Ah, good.
- Anything hard about it?

26:29.326 --> 26:30.284
- Not really.
- No.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.938
Those animals are so cute.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.201
So the real work begins now.

26:34.244 --> 26:38.074
Today, your first job
is to get the sheep sheared.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.077
- Oh.
- We've got 20 head of sheep

26:41.121 --> 26:42.426
for you guys to shear.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.384
Wow.

26:43.427 --> 26:44.777
We've brought in Chad Bedell.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.693
He's gonna teach you guys
how to shear the sheep.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.043
Make sure you keep your hands
on 'em at all times.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.175
Whatever you do,
do not let 'em go.

26:52.219 --> 26:54.090
What happens
if we let 'em go?

26:54.134 --> 26:54.961
- They're gonna run.
- You're gonna have

26:55.004 --> 26:56.005
to catch 'em.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.964
Mm.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.052
All right, Chad.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.444
Wow.
Oh, my--

27:00.488 --> 27:02.708
- Shut up right now.
- All right.

27:02.751 --> 27:05.449
Left hand is under the chin.
You guide their face.

27:05.493 --> 27:08.888
Your right hand grabs the dock
or the tail head.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.978
Just push her off balance.
- We're not hurting them?

27:12.021 --> 27:13.457
- You're not hurting her.
- Okay.

27:13.501 --> 27:16.460
These techniques have been
used for long, long time.

27:16.504 --> 27:17.984
She said--

27:18.027 --> 27:20.464
Take any organic matter.

27:20.508 --> 27:21.596
You're gonna reach down here,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.685
and pull any dingleberries
off there.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.168
Any
- Oh, no.

27:31.171 --> 27:34.653
Oh, my God.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.959
It's definitely not
a normal Wednesday

27:37.003 --> 27:38.831
pulling dingleberries
out of wool.

27:38.874 --> 27:41.703
Just a nice,
clean blow down this belly.

27:41.747 --> 27:45.228
Brush the debris off there,
any manure buildup.

27:45.272 --> 27:47.709
We want this
stretched out, okay?

27:47.753 --> 27:49.102
- Uh-uh.
- Ugh.

27:49.145 --> 27:51.278
Anybody want to come over
and try it?

27:51.321 --> 27:52.540
- Yep, go ahead.
- Of course.

27:52.583 --> 27:53.715
Ugh.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.369
You just turn it on
right there.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.806
Keep your clippers level
with the skin.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.768
Good.
One more down there.

28:02.811 --> 28:03.943
Anybody want a haircut?

28:06.162 --> 28:07.642
- I'm all right.
- All right, Chad.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.384
Thank you so much.
Okay, guys.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.429
24 hours is your deadline
on this.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.736
We've got to get
these 20 sheep sheared.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.259
You need to clean the wool.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.740
Also, you need
to get it bagged, all right?

28:18.784 --> 28:21.134
In 24 hours, we got
the wool buyer coming by.

28:21.177 --> 28:22.657
If you get the job done,

28:22.701 --> 28:24.572
you get the night out
on the town, so--

28:25.965 --> 28:28.576
- Oh, there you go--
- Let's go, baby, come on!

28:28.619 --> 28:31.057
The sheep's in the barn.
You guys have fun.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.320
Wait, wait.
Be careful opening that.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.104
Don't let 'em run out.
You got to hurry up.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.497
They're gonna try to come out.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.282
They're trying to come out.
Hurry up.

28:39.326 --> 28:40.980
Get back.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.460
<i>I'm definitely not getting</i> <i>
in there, at all.</i>

28:43.504 --> 28:45.288
I'm just gonna supervise
everybody, you know?

28:45.332 --> 28:47.726
Yeah, the feet, the feet.
- Nice job, Austin.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.684
Perfect.
- Good teamwork, you guys.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.164
Go Austin.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.470
Slow and controlled.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.603
- Yes!
- There we go.

28:55.646 --> 28:56.865
20 of these?

28:56.909 --> 28:58.475
All right.
- Yeah.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.260
<i>I've never sheared anything</i> <i>
in my life.</i>

29:00.303 --> 29:01.870
I haven't even
cut my own hair before.

29:01.914 --> 29:03.263
Watch your hand, bro.

29:03.306 --> 29:04.786
<i>And it's definitely a hard job</i>

29:04.830 --> 29:06.614
to be the first job that
we have to do while we're here.

29:06.657 --> 29:08.921
We got to do more than one
at a time.

29:08.964 --> 29:12.141
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll try.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.101
There we go.

29:15.144 --> 29:16.798
Hurry up,
'cause we got to shut it.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.321
Oh,

29:18.365 --> 29:20.628
I never knew, like, shearing
sheep would be like this.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.282
That's poop.

29:22.325 --> 29:23.979
Ew.

29:24.023 --> 29:26.373
<i>Pulling all</i> <i>
the dingleberries and poop</i>

29:26.416 --> 29:27.809
<i>out of the wool,</i> <i>
it's disgusting.</i>

29:27.853 --> 29:29.724
Oh, my God.
Look at all that

29:29.768 --> 29:30.899
Ugh!
- Wow.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.814
That is a lot of poop.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.207
I'll be on door watch.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.991
Hey, let's put this one
in the cage, y'all.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.340
I'm not ready.
Hold on.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.689
<i>But I want to try.</i>

29:38.733 --> 29:39.821
That's what I'm here
to do, right?

29:39.865 --> 29:41.736
There you go.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.303
<i>We did it.</i>

29:43.346 --> 29:45.914
- Teamwork.
- Good job.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.136
<i>I love hard work,</i>

29:50.179 --> 29:51.311
<i>and I don't mind</i> <i>
getting dirty.</i>

29:51.354 --> 29:52.486
I mean, I think that's what

29:52.529 --> 29:54.444
differentiates us as roommates.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.533
Ugh.
Why is that wet?

29:56.577 --> 29:58.187
<i>My other roommates don't</i> <i>
like to get dirty</i>

29:58.231 --> 29:59.798
or they think
something smells too bad.

29:59.841 --> 30:00.929
<i>I mean,</i> <i>
you got to put in the work</i>

30:00.973 --> 30:02.235
<i>if you want to get somewhere</i> <i>
in life.</i>

30:02.278 --> 30:04.498
Oh, my God.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.500
I feel like it's,
like, really hard

30:06.543 --> 30:07.588
to get the out of this.

30:07.631 --> 30:08.850
It's freaking
really difficult.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.373
Like, I feel like
we're gonna have to,

30:10.417 --> 30:13.333
like, wash the sheep
before we shave 'em.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.595
Is that what we're
supposed to do?

30:14.638 --> 30:15.901
I--I don't know.
I feel like,

30:15.944 --> 30:17.424
when you get a haircut,
you wash your hair.

30:17.467 --> 30:18.947
- That makes way more sense.
- Right.

30:18.991 --> 30:21.167
When you go get your hair done,
you don't just start.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.951
You know, you wash it,
blow dry it,

30:22.995 --> 30:24.083
fluff it out, and then you cut.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.084
Right?
I think we should

30:25.127 --> 30:26.128
wash the next couple sheeps.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.173
I think so too.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.001
Tay, this is a horrible idea.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.698
<i>You don't see that wool?</i>

30:30.741 --> 30:32.482
You think water's
gonna soften that wool?

30:33.614 --> 30:34.920
Are we washing it before

30:34.963 --> 30:36.486
just because they don't
like picking up poop?

30:36.530 --> 30:37.923
That's 100% why.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.054
We just got
to get it all washed out.

30:39.098 --> 30:40.229
Is there, like, a brush?

30:40.273 --> 30:41.752
Let's just try
to wash it out.

30:41.796 --> 30:44.190
I already know this isn't
gonna be a good idea.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.844
Dude, that is so thick now.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.671
How are you gonna
cut through that?

30:47.715 --> 30:49.499
- Honestly?
- Ah!

30:49.543 --> 30:51.110
You can do it.
Keep doing it.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.546
See?
Look!

30:52.589 --> 30:54.809
Actually, I genuinely
think it's working.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.684
No!
Turn the thing off.

31:04.427 --> 31:05.951
What the [bleep]?

31:05.994 --> 31:08.301
Get back, get back, get back,
get back, get back.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.780
- Oh, my God.
- Wait

31:09.824 --> 31:11.043
Get that one.

31:13.175 --> 31:15.656
- I've got her!
- Why do they run so fast?

31:15.699 --> 31:17.527
Sheep are way faster
than I thought they were.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.921
Oh, my God!
Come back!

31:19.965 --> 31:21.227
Aye,
let them go do their thing.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.271
Let's keep going.

31:22.315 --> 31:23.925
- No, no, no!
- No!

31:23.969 --> 31:25.753
It's gonna go in the barn!

31:25.796 --> 31:27.320
We got it.
We got this.

31:27.363 --> 31:30.062
Oh, I can't run.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.193
I have one heel.
I can't--

31:31.237 --> 31:33.456
- I can't do it anymore!
- Ugh.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.371
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.678
Oh, my God, no!

31:37.721 --> 31:39.549
Nice.

31:39.593 --> 31:42.291
Where is it?
Where did it go?

31:42.335 --> 31:44.685
Boom!

31:44.728 --> 31:46.730
Let's go!

31:46.774 --> 31:49.255
Well, well, well.
There's no sheep.

31:49.298 --> 31:50.343
- I know.
- I know,

31:50.386 --> 31:51.692
but we looked everywhere.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.607
Listen, we got it.
Don't worry about it.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.869
We got tomorrow, too, you know?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.653
Tomorrow?
- It won't be alive.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.786
It won't survive the night.
- It will be alive.

31:58.829 --> 31:59.874
- It eats grass, it's fine.
- It eats the grass.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.832
It's gonna be just fine.
Don't worry.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.356
Honestly, guys,
it's late, okay?

32:03.399 --> 32:04.748
Can we talk about this later?
- And I'm getting sheepy.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.446
- Exactly, it's late, and--
- It's fine.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.230
We will frickin'
find the sheep.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.492
We're gonna find it tomorrow.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.581
Be positive.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.627
- Yo, I'm tired.
- I'm starving.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.411
I'm hungry, tired,
my lips are burnt.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.326
I need to take a shower.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.633
those sheep.
all this.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.635
everything about this,
bro, on God.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.419
This is not
the vibe right now.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.596
You won't do anything.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.250
I've never been on a ranch.
I don't touch sheep,

32:28.294 --> 32:29.686
I don't do none of this stuff.
- We're all in this togeth--

32:29.730 --> 32:30.949
why'd you come here then?

32:39.914 --> 32:41.437
<i>Rise and shine.</i>

32:41.481 --> 32:43.135
Does anybody know
what time it is?

32:43.178 --> 32:45.441
Yeah, it's time
for you to get a watch.

32:45.485 --> 32:46.921
Let me see.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.357
It's hard to pack
for a month not knowing,

32:48.401 --> 32:50.098
like, what you're gonna do,
and yesterday I wore,

32:50.142 --> 32:51.752
like, kind of a cute outfit,
and then I was like,

32:51.795 --> 32:54.059
"Well the sheep got 'em."

32:54.102 --> 32:56.452
Oh, yeah, we still have
to find that sheep.

32:59.325 --> 33:00.848
- All right.
- Let's say a prayer.

33:00.891 --> 33:03.764
Dear God,
please find us our baby sheep.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.635
- Baby--wait, I think it's--
- What'd we name him?

33:05.679 --> 33:07.246
No, it's--
baby sheep's a lamb, remember?

33:07.289 --> 33:08.421
Oh, yeah.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.992
They better show up soon
with that sheep.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.124
The wool broker will
be here soon.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.604
- Wait, don't you try it.
- All right.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.823
Go ahead--oh, wait, no.
Oh, the neck, the neck.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.913
We're off
to a interesting start.

33:23.914 --> 33:25.307
<i>Baa!</i>

33:25.351 --> 33:26.395
<i>I think I'm actually</i> <i>
really good at it.</i>

33:26.439 --> 33:27.744
<i>[both baaing]</i> <i>
- Wait.</i>

33:27.788 --> 33:28.919
<i>Baa.</i>

33:28.963 --> 33:30.051
<i>We kind of sound</i> <i>
like a dolphin.</i>

33:31.922 --> 33:34.142
Hi.
So sorry to bother you.

33:34.186 --> 33:35.752
We lost our sheep.

33:35.796 --> 33:38.755
<i>We are driving</i> <i>
to every neighbor's house</i>

33:38.799 --> 33:39.756
to try and find the sheep.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.149
We lost one of our sheep.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.108
We lost a sheep.
- You lost a sheep?

33:43.151 --> 33:45.023
Do you know what breed it is?

33:45.066 --> 33:48.548
It's white.
- It looks like a sheep.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.725
Baa!

33:51.768 --> 33:53.292
Nice.
That was a good one.

33:54.510 --> 33:55.946
Hold on.
Oh!

33:55.990 --> 33:58.166
- Oh, my God, Ebie.
- Yeah.

33:58.210 --> 34:00.038
I wore a very inappropriate
jacket today.

34:00.081 --> 34:02.040
Damn, the audacity
to bring a wool jacket

34:02.083 --> 34:04.607
while we're shearing sheep.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.740
Yo, I need some help, bro.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.089
I'm good.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.873
- There we go.
- Oh, my gosh.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.527
That one can stay hairy.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.747
<i>Honestly, I'm kind of used</i> <i>
to being the best</i>

34:13.790 --> 34:15.183
<i>at everything that I do.</i>

34:15.227 --> 34:19.013
It's just how I am, and I tend
to not like to do things

34:19.057 --> 34:20.971
that I know I won't be good at.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.625
What is that green stuff?

34:22.669 --> 34:24.845
- That's poop.
- Uh-uh.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.542
<i>Shearing sheep--</i> <i>
that's one of those things.</i>

34:26.586 --> 34:28.457
<i>I know I'm not gonna be good</i> <i>
at it, so why waste my time?</i>

34:28.501 --> 34:30.981
- Bag.
- All right, so I'ma turn him.

34:31.025 --> 34:33.071
- How good is the haircut?
- Right?

34:33.114 --> 34:36.074
Baa-d.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.206
We only got two more, guys.
Two more.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.254
- Absolutely not.
- Exactly.

34:42.297 --> 34:44.560
What do you mean exactly?
I'm trying to get you to do it

34:44.604 --> 34:46.519
'cause you know how, so that
we can get through this.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.738
It must be nice
to have the afternoon off.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.175
Oh, hell no.

34:50.218 --> 34:51.350
She doesn't want
to do this part.

34:51.393 --> 34:52.438
At least she, like,
tried to help--

34:52.481 --> 34:53.439
She doesn't want
to do any part.

34:53.482 --> 34:54.570
- Who?
- She didn't try to help--

34:54.614 --> 34:56.616
You.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.401
What do you mean
I won't do any part?

34:59.445 --> 35:00.663
- You won't do anything.
- I am.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.361
You're supervising
and touched a bag.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.710
Like, I'm in here, like...
- Exactly.

35:03.753 --> 35:04.754
You said I did nothing.
- Wrestling, like sheep.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.410
It's not my fault
you enjoy this.

35:08.454 --> 35:09.629
- Ebie, it's okay--no.
- No, it's not that--

35:09.672 --> 35:11.500
But she don't know
how to do this.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.113
Ebie's definitely lazy
as

35:15.156 --> 35:17.419
I'm hot.
I'm tired.

35:17.463 --> 35:18.681
<i>She doesn't want</i> <i>
to do the work.</i>

35:18.725 --> 35:20.248
<i>This is the first job where,</i> <i>
you know,</i>

35:20.292 --> 35:21.684
<i>people got to get</i> <i>
their feet wet a little bit,</i>

35:21.728 --> 35:22.903
but you can do something.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.252
Come on.

35:24.296 --> 35:25.427
Everybody's at least
pitching in something.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.646
- Right, right.
- And, like, sorry,

35:26.689 --> 35:29.605
but, like, Ebie,
you're not doing anything.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.607
I've never been on a ranch.
I don't touch sheep.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.696
I don't ride horses.
I don't do none of this stuff.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.220
We're all in this--
why did you come here...

35:35.263 --> 35:36.395
We are in this together.

35:36.438 --> 35:37.787
Like,
if you're not gonna help us?

35:37.831 --> 35:39.833
<i>♪</i>

35:39.876 --> 35:41.748
<i>He's kind of, like,</i> <i>
being a dick.</i>

35:41.791 --> 35:43.271
<i>Like, I don't think</i> <i>
it's Austin's place</i>

35:43.315 --> 35:45.621
to tell anyone what they should
or shouldn't do.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.188
He should just focus
on what he's doing.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.624
You cannot expect
that much from me.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.539
I just got from LA.
Listen, I don't know--

35:50.583 --> 35:53.412
Learn to hold a bag
with both hands?

35:53.455 --> 35:55.501
<i>Austin is a real</i> <i>
horse's ass.</i>

35:55.544 --> 35:58.678
He's very bossy,
so that's where we clash.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.422
Well,
looky what we got here.

36:03.465 --> 36:05.293
Where'd you guys find that?

36:05.337 --> 36:08.340
We found the sheep!

36:08.383 --> 36:10.559
Aye!

36:10.603 --> 36:12.822
You know what?
Me and Hana are rockstars.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.520
We found our sheep.

36:14.563 --> 36:16.043
- Hello.
- Hi.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.610
We lost a sheep yesterday.

36:17.653 --> 36:19.133
We definitely got
an extra one here.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.352
Yeah?

36:20.395 --> 36:22.223
You're more than welcome
to go look.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.659
Look for, like, a soggy butt.

36:25.792 --> 36:26.880
Yeah.
It's okay.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.664
I just want
to smell their butts.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.277
I got him.
This is it.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.540
Smell his butt, for sure.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.845
All right, bubba, we're
taking you back to the ranch.

36:35.889 --> 36:36.846
- This way.
- Come on.

36:36.890 --> 36:39.022
Yeah!

36:39.066 --> 36:41.503
We found the sheep!

36:41.547 --> 36:43.505
I don't know if it's
actually our missing sheep.

36:43.549 --> 36:44.985
They could have bought it
from somewhere else,

36:45.028 --> 36:46.334
but I'll take it.

36:46.378 --> 36:47.814
We're almost done.
We're almost done.

36:47.857 --> 36:48.902
- Whoo!
- Dudes.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.469
We're almost there.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.297
We're just gonna shave it up
and get this job done.

36:57.650 --> 36:58.955
That's 20, baby!

36:58.999 --> 36:59.956
- Good job, team.
- That's 20.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.175
- That's 20!
- Whoo!

37:01.219 --> 37:03.438
- Whoo!
- Let's go!

37:03.482 --> 37:05.832
Whoo!

37:05.875 --> 37:06.876
You know what I'll never do?

37:06.920 --> 37:09.052
Unappreciate wool, ever again.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.445
This is so tough, dude.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.230
And like,
my back was hurting

37:12.273 --> 37:13.361
so much
when I was doing the shearing.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.710
- Yeah.
- Hey, supervisor,

37:14.754 --> 37:15.711
how are we doing?

37:15.755 --> 37:16.582
- You're doing very well.
- Yes?

37:16.625 --> 37:17.670
- Yes, keep going.
- Okay.

37:17.713 --> 37:20.150
Just push.
- No, I need full--

37:20.194 --> 37:21.587
- Bang.
- Full protection?

37:21.630 --> 37:23.850
Yeah.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.112
Yeah!

37:25.155 --> 37:26.722
- This is what we like to see.
- Hey, guys.

37:26.766 --> 37:27.680
Are y'all done?

37:27.723 --> 37:29.072
We did it.

37:29.116 --> 37:30.291
- Yes, sir.
- They're all done.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.075
All 20.
- All 20 of them are there.

37:32.119 --> 37:34.426
All 20 are done.

37:35.383 --> 37:37.037
Looks nice.
- Told you guys.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.256
- Yeah.
- Does that look good?

37:38.299 --> 37:40.170
- Good job.
- Yeah, baby!

37:40.214 --> 37:41.563
Yeah.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.913
<i>We crushed our first job.</i>

37:43.957 --> 37:47.177
<i>Yes, we had many obstacles</i> <i>
to get through,</i>

37:47.221 --> 37:49.789
but we rallied together,
and we got the job done.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.138
Whoo!

37:51.181 --> 37:52.487
That's top-notch wool
right there.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.315
<i>But at the same time,</i>

37:54.359 --> 37:56.012
<i>I can tell</i> <i>
some of my roommates</i>

37:56.056 --> 37:57.492
are gonna have
a tough time here.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.711
She doesn't want
to do any part.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.408
- Who?
- You.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.717
So absolutely, guys.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.762
We told you,
if you got the job done,

38:06.806 --> 38:09.069
that you'd get a night out
on the town, so...

38:09.112 --> 38:10.157
Whoo! - You guys are welcome

38:10.200 --> 38:11.201
to head on down.

38:12.812 --> 38:15.118
Just remember,
mornings come early here.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.512
Yes, they do.
- Thank you.

38:17.556 --> 38:18.557
Yeah!

38:21.037 --> 38:22.604
When I drink, I drink a lot.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.346
And I like it.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.478
You got to stop,
you got to stop.

38:31.744 --> 38:32.919
Aye, night out.
Let's go.

38:32.962 --> 38:35.138
Civilization, baby.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.444
- Just remember, we got chores.
- Appreciate you.

38:36.488 --> 38:37.924
We got chores, guys,
early in the morning.

38:37.967 --> 38:38.925
But we don't have
to shear sheep,

38:38.968 --> 38:40.318
because we did that.

38:40.361 --> 38:41.362
That was the hardest task

38:41.406 --> 38:42.276
that we're probably gonna do.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.408
- We did that.
- We did it.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.409
- We did that.
- Whoo!

38:44.452 --> 38:46.062
Cheers to finding the goat.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.673
I mean sheep.
Sorry.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.284
Oh, that's perfect.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.938
I love you guys.
Thank you guys all

38:51.981 --> 38:54.027
so much for being so open.

38:54.070 --> 38:55.942
We're just getting started,
but we got a ways to go.

38:55.985 --> 38:57.683
Totally.
100%.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.511
Thank you.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.295
Oh, yum.
- That looks so good.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.036
I need a fork.

39:03.079 --> 39:05.386
- You need a what?
- A fork.

39:05.430 --> 39:06.561
<i>I don't touch my food.</i>

39:06.605 --> 39:08.215
I think it's disgusting
to touch food.

39:08.258 --> 39:09.912
Do you want to know why?

39:09.956 --> 39:12.132
<i>'Cause some guy will dive</i> <i>
into a burger.</i>

39:12.175 --> 39:14.830
They'll eat their burger
and, like--

39:14.874 --> 39:16.441
Oh, my God.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.315
There's, like,
liquid that actually

39:21.359 --> 39:23.099
emits from your fingers,

39:23.143 --> 39:24.927
so when you touch the burger,

39:24.971 --> 39:27.147
<i>all the [bleep]'s filling</i> <i>
into the bun,</i>

39:27.190 --> 39:29.758
<i>and the bun's absorbing it,</i> <i>
and then you're eating that,</i>

39:29.802 --> 39:32.152
and I think that's disgusting.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.372
Excuse me,
could I get a plastic fork

39:34.415 --> 39:37.679
and a plastic knife please,
in a package?

39:37.723 --> 39:39.115
<i>Harry is a pretty</i> <i>
interesting guy.</i>

39:39.159 --> 39:40.639
I don't think he has
the easiest time

39:40.682 --> 39:41.814
with social interactions.

39:41.857 --> 39:43.468
You can die
from this

39:45.208 --> 39:47.080
<i>But everybody loves him.</i> <i>
I'm looking forward</i>

39:47.123 --> 39:49.212
to seeing if Harry can make
it here, on the ranch.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.304
- I've never seen that before.
- That's wild.

39:54.348 --> 39:57.003
Like, I have, like,
a lot of anxiety.

39:57.046 --> 40:00.049
I heard "anxiety"
and I was like, I get it.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.964
It is a daily struggle.

40:02.008 --> 40:04.706
No one understands
that doesn't have it.

40:06.665 --> 40:10.451
Anxiety has been a huge part
of my everyday life.

40:10.495 --> 40:13.976
Like, I wake up
in the morning panicking.

40:14.020 --> 40:17.850
And I've been to the hospital
several times,

40:17.893 --> 40:20.635
recently actually, um,

40:20.679 --> 40:23.203
like, feeling like I can't
breathe and stuff like that.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.423
You guys think
I'm weird, huh?

40:25.466 --> 40:27.294
- No, you're not weird.
- If you're weird,

40:27.337 --> 40:30.471
then I'm weird as hell,
so cheers.

40:30.515 --> 40:31.951
