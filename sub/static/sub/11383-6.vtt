00:05.381 --> 00:06.621
You are Primary.

00:06.716 --> 00:09.048
Locked up for delusions
and voices in the head?

00:09.177 --> 00:10.383
That sound like
anybody we know?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.467
Jennifer Goines.
Yes, she's crazy, too.

00:12.555 --> 00:14.967
She's notjust crazy. She's...

00:15.057 --> 00:16.388

PALLID MAN:
It's 1975, to be precise.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.081
We sent two
of our Messengers there
after him.

through a Red Forest.

on another trip
to see the Witness?

00:49.258 --> 00:52.500

out your Messengers.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.877
You know, the skeptic in me
finds it hard to believe

01:32.969 --> 01:35.711

the result of the murder

01:35.805 --> 01:37.966

back in time.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.638
lt's notjust murder.

01:40.476 --> 01:44.890
They're paradoxing a Primary,
removing a vital string
in the fabric of time.

01:44.981 --> 01:47.142
lt's unwinding before
our eyes.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.475
This is causality driven
insane.

01:52.238 --> 01:57.153
Won't be long before
it will devour our past,

You're not going
all Biblical on me now,
are you, Kat?

02:05.668 --> 02:07.499
We need to find
the next Primary,

02:07.586 --> 02:09.292

from destroying them.

02:09.672 --> 02:12.254

beautiful eyes on this.

Nice job, buddy.

03:02.308 --> 03:03.388
You're supposed to be
watching my back, man.

03:03.476 --> 03:04.556
You're high-fiving the enemy?

Oh, man. lthink

03:09.065 --> 03:10.521
Avenge me, brother. (GROWLS)

03:16.739 --> 03:19.230
What? We can't play outside.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.070
We know where to find
the Primary in 1975.

03:25.581 --> 03:26.741
Game over.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.494

in time again?

03:33.923 --> 03:35.083
Probably.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.507
Nah.

03:40.763 --> 03:43.596
I got a more importantjob.

03:45.017 --> 03:48.601
You could've stopped
a lot of people
from dying before.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.558
And you didn't.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.943
I know you love me,

about my future.

KATARINA: Thanks to Dr. Railly
and Ms. Goines,

04:11.419 --> 04:14.206
we have the name of another
of the Messengers' victims.

04:17.883 --> 04:18.872
JAMES: Kyle Slade.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.459
Died July the 2nd, 1975.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.379
Slade was a drifter,
no permanent address,

04:24.473 --> 04:26.384
believed to reside
near Greenwich Village.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.137
Do we know how many
Messengers were sent back
to kill this guy?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.807
There are four
unaccounted for.

04:32.648 --> 04:33.808
But if they are consistent,

04:33.941 --> 04:37.058
at least two assassins
were sent after Mr. Slade.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.647
We believe it's these two men.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.738
Unfortunately, there's
no security footage
of the others.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.908
But there is something
that you should know.

04:47.788 --> 04:52.327
This man, Kyle Slade,
was believed to
be "The Immortal."

04:52.460 --> 04:53.495
A serial killer

04:53.586 --> 04:57.078
responsible for
the murder and dismemberment

04:57.173 --> 05:00.586
of at least 12 people
between 1974 and '75.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.416
What?

05:02.511 --> 05:03.591
Staff Sergeant Slade

05:03.679 --> 05:06.421
was dishonorably discharged
from the US. Army

05:06.515 --> 05:09.632
after allegedly butchering
several Viet Cong soldiers.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.343
I'm supposed to
protect this guy?

05:13.772 --> 05:17.014
How you prevent him
from being paradoxed
is up to you.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.349
HOW do | find him?

05:20.362 --> 05:23.775
Victoria Mason. The lmmortal's
12th and final victim.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.858
The only one police
could identify.
The rest were indigents.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.449
Murdered July 2nd, 1975.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.202
(GRUNTS)
Same day Slade's body
was found.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.042
In other words, paradoxed.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.875
So I splinter in
before he finds Victoria.

05:40.799 --> 05:44.508
You follow her to Slade,
wait till the Messengers come.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.219
Then we take 'em out.

05:47.890 --> 05:48.879
”We”?

no look, little brother.

yourself killed.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.397
It's either that or Jonesy
sends me back in time

05:58.526 --> 06:01.063
to save your ass again.

06:01.237 --> 06:03.398

Just admit it.

06:03.739 --> 06:04.854
What about the girl?

06:05.032 --> 06:08.570
I strongly recommend
not getting involved.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.577
You mean let her die.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.740

06:12.831 --> 06:15.322

than we already have.

have been recalibrated.

coordinates within seconds
of each other.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.926
I'm used to certain amenities.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.929
This place is old.
And it smells.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.354

Probably haunted.

08:01.940 --> 08:02.975

think that ghosts
are just replays.

in ghosts, do you?

But we can't
hold it up forever.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.303
Someday Atlas is gonna shrug.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.773
And when that day comes,

27:29.857 --> 27:31.768
this whole city
is gonna turn
into a ghost town

27:31.859 --> 27:33.474
I've seen it.
Seen what?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.648
A forest of blood.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.189
It was like hell on earth.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.195
AARON: It’s beautiful.

27:41.702 --> 27:45.991
A place where time
no longer exists.

27:46.833 --> 27:50.667
A place where you can be
with the one you love forever.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.710
What could be more
important than that?

27:54.841 --> 27:55.921
No.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.755
No, it can't be that way.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.507
It's the only way.

28:02.598 --> 28:07.558
Don't you understand?
The Red Forest is
the only way to beat death!

28:08.479 --> 28:09.980

wants to be immortal

28:10.064 --> 28:11.850
in his timeless forest.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.226
But can you imagine?

28:13.317 --> 28:16.229
Destroying time itself
so everything that's left

28:16.320 --> 28:19.062
is living and dying
in the same moment.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.021
An eternal now.

28:21.117 --> 28:23.483
Everything you've ever known,
anyone that you've ever loved.

28:23.578 --> 28:26.320
There's no future, no past.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.825
Forever red.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.295
The Witness is here.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.179
Careful.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.222
For any curious cats.

28:57.778 --> 28:58.858
Come on.

29:22.219 --> 29:23.755
What did I tell you?

29:26.349 --> 29:29.432
The Witness. In the flesh.

29:41.656 --> 29:44.944
He came for me,
but I was smarter.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.201
Careful, careful!

29:54.835 --> 29:56.086
This has to be done right.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.337
What the hell
did you do to him?

30:01.884 --> 30:02.999
I needed help.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.543
So, I sent up a flare.

30:06.639 --> 30:07.719
Victoria.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.723
That's why she was the only
identifiable victim.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.551
I knew that you would
follow her through time
right to me.

30:13.646 --> 30:17.264
I knew that you would
come here to finish
what I started.

30:36.627 --> 30:38.959

The Witness is a Traveler
just like you.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.534
He's been doing it far,
far longer.

31:17.626 --> 31:21.585
He's got abilities,
technology, way beyond yours.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.830
He can get inside your head.

31:25.634 --> 31:26.885
But he's just a man.

31:28.596 --> 31:30.177

kill me with this,
his dagger made of bone.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.664
It's my bone that
they dig up in the future.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.876

the Witness with this.

What's going on?

33:57.620 --> 33:58.985
The Witness was here.

He's a Messenger.

The other one.
They come in pairs.

You're wrong.
I'm too important.

34:13.093 --> 34:16.677
The Witness wanted
to do me personally,
but I saw him coming.

you would come here.

he wants to destroy time.
