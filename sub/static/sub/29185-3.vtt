what, 35 hours?

Hey, don't worry.

You're exactly where

Well, I-I paint my dreams,
you know?

Sometimes I see chimeras,
sometimes the future.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.411
But, uh,
it's a real thing.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.878
You know, I got
a group of doctors

00:44.912 --> 00:47.248
who pay to study my brain.
[Laughs]

00:47.281 --> 00:49.983
Yeah, I see 'em when
I-I'm up here on business.

Suddenly, all the pieces

the chandelier,

00:59.693 --> 01:01.362

that he'd been set up.

Oh, my God.
[Stops cassette]

01:04.532 --> 01:06.467
You know,

01:06.500 --> 01:10.070
I have a theory about
L. Marvin Metz.

01:10.104 --> 01:14.708
I think that he's a Lynx
like us.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.277
You ever notice that
all his books

01:16.310 --> 01:19.413
are set in a city
where there's a lodge?

01:19.447 --> 01:20.848
Hmm.
Mm.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.283
Damn, you're right.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.185
He's on his North American
book tour right now,

01:24.218 --> 01:28.456
and if he comes to Guadalajara,
I'm gonna ask him in person.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.925
[Chuckles]

01:31.959 --> 01:35.796
So you were
a Sovereign Protector.

01:35.829 --> 01:39.032
Mm-hmm. Lodge 55.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.469
It was one of the stops
on Larry's Grand Tour.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.271
Ah.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.307
It's  all  about
the connections.

01:46.340 --> 01:51.279
"The world is bound
by secret knots."

01:51.312 --> 01:53.046
Mm-hmm.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.416
I remember reading that when
I was studying to be a knight.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.786
Mm. Larry said you were
a great knight...

01:58.819 --> 02:01.855
Mm.
...and a true warrior.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.657
Ah, Larry.

Hey, don't bust out
crying.

Well, I-I paint the destination,
not the path.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.212
[Chuckles] Okay.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.248
So, what's the plan?

03:00.281 --> 03:02.883
Little siesta, go into town,

03:02.916 --> 03:05.386
and find your antiquarian,
right?

03:05.419 --> 03:08.689
Well...
[sighs] not exactly.

03:08.722 --> 03:12.125
We're not going to Guadalajara.
We're going someplace else.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.561
Where?

03:13.594 --> 03:16.264
A little place called
Comala.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.267
Strange place.

03:19.300 --> 03:23.971
At noon,
the shadows look...wrong.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.473
The wind blows hot
all the time,

03:25.506 --> 03:28.476
even at midnight.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.511
What are you talkin' about?

03:30.544 --> 03:34.382
[Sighs] Grab a couple beers,
and I'll explain.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.517
That's when I won
the bowling bag from Larry,

03:36.550 --> 03:38.652
but he didn't tell me
the whole story.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.021
I thought it was just
some old artifacts and shit

03:41.054 --> 03:42.590
that I could sell.
Mm-hmm.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.658
So I took 'em to the lodge
and I offered 'em around,

03:44.692 --> 03:48.829
and there was this one dude,
Roberto Núñez,

03:48.862 --> 03:50.964
and he was a bricklayer
from Comala.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.900
He was super into alchemy.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.569
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles] There's always
a few, huh?

03:55.603 --> 03:58.506
Oh, sure. We have ours.
Blaise. And Dud, too.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.274
[Chuckles] Yeah.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.676
So Roberto offered
to trade me for a car.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.111
Mm-hmm.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.479
Turned out to be
an old beater truck.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.980
It was put together
with Bondo.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.717
I said, "I don't think so."
[Laughs]

04:09.750 --> 04:12.853
But I told him I had this offer
from a high-end antiquarian

04:12.886 --> 04:14.588
who offered me $10,000.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.189
Mm.
So that's what I did.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.626
I went to the antiquarian
and I gave him the bowling bag,

04:18.659 --> 04:20.494
and he gave me 10 grand.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.496
So when I got back
to the lodge,

04:22.530 --> 04:26.467
Roberto Núñez stuck a gun
in my face and took my money.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.402
Jacked by a fellow Lynx.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.571
That is cold.
Isn't it?

04:30.604 --> 04:33.807
Yeah.
And then Larry calls me up.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.843
It wasn't just some shit.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.245
It was the scrolls.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.013
So I went back
to the antiquarian.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.616
He said a week after
we made the deal,

04:42.650 --> 04:45.419
somebody broke into his shop,
stole a bunch of shit...

04:45.453 --> 04:49.423
Mm.
...and the bowling bag,
and then burned down the shop.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.559
You think Roberto did it.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.960
Well, yeah.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.397
I mean, he stole my money
and took the scrolls.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.031
This is some heavy shit.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.800
Mm!

04:59.833 --> 05:01.802
So that's why
I brought you in.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.304
I could use
your assassin skills.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.374
[Chuckles]
Assassin skills?

05:06.407 --> 05:08.642
Yeah, well, Larry told me
you were a Navy SEAL.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.344
[Chuckling] No, man!

05:10.378 --> 05:12.413

Personally, I'd take
the the donkey-corn

11:45.873 --> 11:47.875
over the order desk.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.576
[Groans]

11:49.609 --> 11:51.478
Uh, Ern-- Ernie!

11:51.511 --> 11:53.213
[Door closes]

11:53.246 --> 11:58.218
Jeremy: Well, so here at
Higher Steaks,

11:58.251 --> 12:03.190
we like to ask the question,
what do people want?

12:03.223 --> 12:06.426
The answer is...

12:06.459 --> 12:08.695
Is it Higher Steaks?

12:08.728 --> 12:12.165
[Chuckles] Yes, it is!

12:12.199 --> 12:15.102
Higher Steaks.
Everything is Higher Steaks now.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.870
Everything.

12:16.904 --> 12:20.307
[Clears throat]
Life or death. Every day.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.110
Do you really need
to interview me?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.611
This isn't Shamroxx, Liz.

12:24.644 --> 12:28.081
No. No, you're right.
This is Higher Steaks.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.483
[Speaks indistinctly]

12:30.517 --> 12:33.620
[Clears throat]
So, uh, tell me about

12:33.653 --> 12:37.057
your last job experience.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.659
Uh, my boss
was a total psycho.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.795
He got busted by the Feds.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.464
Well, that sounds, um...

12:44.497 --> 12:45.999
challenging,

12:46.033 --> 12:49.202
and yet, um, fulfilling.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.671
Does it?

12:51.704 --> 12:56.276
I just remember seeing you
at the temp office,

12:56.309 --> 13:02.215
lost and drifting
and terrified.

13:03.750 --> 13:08.121
But, hey, here we are,
together again,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.423
and everything's great!

13:10.457 --> 13:15.362
This is a really upscale...
eating experience,

13:15.395 --> 13:18.866
and I'm confident that
we'll all rise

13:18.899 --> 13:21.902
to meet
the f-fulfilling challenge --
Jeremy, Jeremy.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.071
Hey.
[Breathing heavily]

13:24.104 --> 13:27.207
It'll be fine. Okay?

13:27.240 --> 13:30.777
[Sighs deeply]

13:30.810 --> 13:32.412
Thank you.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.985
You're hired.
Of course you're hired.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.519
You were always gonna
be hired.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.389
[Chuckles] All this --
this was all Kabuki.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.592
Just stupid, stupid Kabuki.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.594
Great.
Yeah, whew!

13:47.627 --> 13:49.229
So...

13:49.262 --> 13:53.633
according to El Confidente --
who is apparently real?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.068
Yep.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.637
Um, somewhere in Guadalajara,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.772
there's a vengeful antiquarian

13:59.806 --> 14:03.210
who might be in possession
of the scrolls.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.112
That's my understanding.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.679
Wow.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.051
That's a lot.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.920
[Chuckling] Yeah.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.621
You have a plan, or...

14:14.654 --> 14:17.790
Well -- well, we need
El Confidente first,

14:17.824 --> 14:21.028
and I can't find any info
on Lodge 55.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.796
There's no current address,
and Ernie is no help.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.433
He's in some kind of a mood
or somethin'.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.867
One thing at a time.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.603
Um, I tried a new
fermentation process

14:30.637 --> 14:34.441
using, uh, Glauber's
Pharmacopoeia Spagyrica.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.875
Should have
a little more kick.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.011
Great, great. I-I need it.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.479
The dickheads
at the hospital,

14:39.512 --> 14:42.015
they're giving me grief
about my bill.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.118
Um, any progress
on the diary?

14:45.152 --> 14:47.320
No.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.789
No.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.925
But I wanna show you somethin'.
Follow me.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.796
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa!

14:56.829 --> 14:58.631
Whoa. Okay.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.400
So are y--
are you livin' here?

15:00.433 --> 15:01.969
Just for
the last few months.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.004
I was over at the Driftwood
apartments for a long time,

15:04.037 --> 15:05.438
but the owner died,

15:05.472 --> 15:06.974
investment group
bought the property,

15:07.007 --> 15:08.641
tripled the rent,
so here I am.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.610
Yeah, that's crazy.
Is that even legal?

15:10.643 --> 15:13.580
Yep.
You can't fight progress.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.182
I'm good.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.717
This place is safe and secure.
It's got everything I need.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.321
And more importantly,
I set up my lab --

15:21.354 --> 15:23.790
Magnum Opus HQ.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.058
[Chuckling] Yeah. Yeah.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.926
So cool. What's that?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.362
Philosophic egg.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.364
It's a key component.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.700
It's where materials mingle
and then emerge

15:33.733 --> 15:36.469
as a new substance
totally reborn.

15:36.503 --> 15:39.506
These dream images
are coded instructions

15:39.539 --> 15:42.609
for the material process.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.078
Yeah.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.980
Dreams.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.050
Dreams are important,
right?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.852
Oh, yeah. Carl Jung was
obsessed with alchemy.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.088
His whole
theory of the unconscious

15:55.122 --> 15:57.890
comes out of it.
Yeah.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.027
The -- the reason
I mention it

16:00.060 --> 16:03.696
is 'cause Larry sort of
came to me in a dream.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.199
Yeah.
We were in the tavern,

16:06.233 --> 16:09.236
and he told me to find
Thermosaurus.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.870
[Chuckles]

16:10.903 --> 16:12.572
By which he meant
the holy grail,

16:12.605 --> 16:14.207
by which he meant
the scrolls.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.509
Yeah.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.612
And his mom was there, too.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.383
That's pretty specific.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.884
Yeah, it -- it could've
been a dream,

16:24.917 --> 16:28.821
but it also sounds like it
might've been a visitation.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.390
Just throwin' that
out there.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.592
You mean, like,
from Larry's ghost?

standing on the sidelines,

17:16.203 --> 17:18.971
feeling scared and useless.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.841
All I remember is
the cold and the damp,

17:21.874 --> 17:23.876
wishing I was
somewhere else.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.313
[Sighs]

17:26.346 --> 17:28.448
I fit in.

17:28.481 --> 17:32.018
Well, you know, when you're
big and strong and powerful,

you really feel like you do.

I just
hated it after a while.

17:44.697 --> 17:48.000

so...

18:06.619 --> 18:08.488
Yeah. Are you thinking
of restoring tabs?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.657
Because I think that would
go a long way to --

18:10.690 --> 18:14.694
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Somethin' even better.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.397
Naming of the Dead.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.167
Yeah! It's supposed to be
an annual event,

18:20.200 --> 18:23.236
but Larry just blew it off
like everything else.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.206
Do you really think
a marathon candle-lit eulogy

18:26.239 --> 18:29.576

is the best way to promote...

18:31.844 --> 18:33.313

we've lost our sense of duty.

Higher Steaks.

19:11.751 --> 19:15.388
Others, frankly, cannot.

our first team-building exercise

19:18.358 --> 19:20.927

19:30.136 --> 19:32.505
My name is Janet Price,

19:36.709 --> 19:39.712
Why start a restaurant

19:39.746 --> 19:41.681
that food is
a life-or-death proposition?

19:41.714 --> 19:44.617
Doesn't life already
depend on food?

19:44.651 --> 19:47.186
Well, to an extent.

19:47.220 --> 19:51.057
Not long ago, I was stuck.

19:51.090 --> 19:54.327
Yes, I was rich and powerful

19:54.361 --> 19:56.663
and being hailed throughout
the industry as a visionary

19:56.696 --> 19:58.431
who was changing the way
the world thinks

19:58.465 --> 20:00.400

and restructuring

20:00.433 --> 20:02.635

distribution chains.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.904
But on the inside,

20:04.937 --> 20:07.974
I felt wretched and alone.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.577
So one night,

20:10.610 --> 20:13.045
on a boat
in the middle of a harbor

20:13.079 --> 20:16.783

my inner Godhead,

20:32.064 --> 20:34.667
roared one thing --

"Swim, Janet. Swim."

21:37.096 --> 21:39.932
We have them in stock here,

21:39.966 --> 21:42.735
tell him you'll drop them off
yourself today.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.637

-[Jeremy groans]
-Champ: Have a seat. Alright.

23:02.882 --> 23:07.119
Okay. You're okay.
-[Groaning continues]

23:07.153 --> 23:09.522
Liz...

23:09.556 --> 23:10.957
you're manager.

Jeremy...

23:14.827 --> 23:16.062
bar.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.997
[Exhales sharply]
Oh, thank God.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.833

23:20.867 --> 23:22.969
And checkmate.
Gerson: Oh! [Laughs]

23:23.002 --> 23:25.972
[Applause]

23:26.005 --> 23:31.077
**

23:31.110 --> 23:32.712
So, what kind of fish
do you get?

23:32.745 --> 23:37.116
Mm, off the jetty --
rockfish, amberjack, halibut.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.886
Nice. Very "Island of
the Blue Dolphins."

23:39.919 --> 23:42.922
Yeah, when society collapses,
I'll be able to feed myself.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.992
Yes, you and your army
of violent scavengers.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.260
Society not going to collapse.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.996
You still have to go to college.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.531
[Door bell dings]

23:51.564 --> 23:53.633
[Exhales sharply]

23:53.666 --> 23:55.635
[Muzak plays]
Hi.

23:55.668 --> 24:00.573
I was just driving by, and I saw
the old Dudley & Son sign,

24:00.607 --> 24:05.912
and, uh...I don't know,
something told me to stop by.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.446
And then I saw you in here
dressed like

24:07.480 --> 24:09.649
you're on your way
to Monte Carlo.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.083
[Scoffs] No, no.

24:11.117 --> 24:14.086
I'm, uh, just hanging out
in Donuts.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.590
Wanna have a cup of coffee?

24:17.624 --> 24:20.893
Higher Steaks. Hmm, hmm.
It's new.

24:20.927 --> 24:25.231
I used to work at Shamroxx,
so this is a step up, sort of.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.966
[Chuckles] Shamroxx?

24:26.999 --> 24:29.702
Mm.
Well, you look great.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.172
Though your skin looks
a little dry.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.543
Are you drinking
enough water?

24:36.576 --> 24:40.246
Uh, no. Probably not.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.982
[Chuckles]
Yesterday was nuts.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.985
I know.
Thanks for helping out.

24:46.018 --> 24:49.856
I w-- I was thinking about
you and your brother.

24:49.889 --> 24:53.459
Your dad was
such a nice guy.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.963
I read about
what happened to him.

24:56.996 --> 25:01.100
It -- it sounds like
you've had a hell of a year.

25:01.133 --> 25:05.137
Yeah, I guess so.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.274
This may sound weird, but...

25:08.307 --> 25:10.843
I'd love it if you guys
could come over

25:10.877 --> 25:13.680
and -- and let me
cook dinner for you.

25:13.713 --> 25:16.315
**

25:16.348 --> 25:19.151
Okay.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.253
[Thunder rumbling]

25:21.287 --> 25:23.723
Clara: Some lodges are nicer
than others,

25:23.756 --> 25:27.493
but they all have their quirks.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.162
I usually get to explore
whatever city I'm in.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.964
Do you have
a favorite city?

25:31.998 --> 25:33.432
[Rain falling]

25:33.465 --> 25:35.735
I'd say Turin.

25:39.606 --> 25:42.108
Something happened
while I was there.

25:44.310 --> 25:47.546
Or I should say
nothing happened.

25:47.580 --> 25:51.884
**

25:51.918 --> 25:55.521
It was autumn time,

25:55.554 --> 25:59.959
and I was walking on me own
in Piazza San Carlo,

25:59.992 --> 26:05.264
and suddenly, there was
something strange and menacing

26:05.297 --> 26:07.533
about
the late afternoon light.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.672
And I just stood there,

26:12.705 --> 26:15.307
paralyzed,

26:15.341 --> 26:20.312
like a statue staring at
my own shadow for eternity.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.782
But it was only a moment,

26:22.815 --> 26:26.886
and then it all
went dark after that.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.722
Checked myself
into a psychiatric ward

26:29.756 --> 26:31.590
for a couple of weeks.

26:34.794 --> 26:38.164
I've never
told anyone this.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.033
[Inhales sharply]

26:41.067 --> 26:43.135
Well...

26:43.169 --> 26:45.071
Turin sounds  great.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.605
[Chuckles]

26:48.975 --> 26:53.312
I saw doctors, but it was
the lodge that got me back.

26:53.345 --> 26:57.116
I read about
Harwood Fritz Merrill.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.786
He had similar episodes.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.755
Also developed
a seizure condition.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.958
He devised his own
alchemical remedies,

27:05.992 --> 27:08.961
like the Orbiscope.

27:08.995 --> 27:12.298
See, I love Turin 'cause it's
the first point on a new map,

27:12.331 --> 27:14.433
my own map.
[Breathing heavily]

27:14.466 --> 27:18.337
And from there, I found my way
to a different, better place.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.909
[Continues
breathing heavily]

27:22.942 --> 27:25.945
**

27:32.018 --> 27:35.587
I started having seizures
a few years ago.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.189
What?

27:37.223 --> 27:40.326
Oh, Connie, darling.

27:40.359 --> 27:44.130
The diagnosis, uh...

27:44.163 --> 27:48.868
isn't, uh...good.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.636
I didn't run away
from Long Beach

27:50.669 --> 27:54.273
because of my shit show
of a personal life,

27:54.306 --> 27:57.977
though that's part of it.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.912
[Voice breaks]
I was running away from...

28:03.115 --> 28:06.318
You can say it.

28:08.921 --> 28:12.324
I'm scared...

28:12.358 --> 28:17.063
to die.

28:17.096 --> 28:21.300
It's as stupid
and simple as that.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.770
I'm scared that my life

28:23.803 --> 28:27.907
will end without a chance
to actually see it

28:27.940 --> 28:32.011
or understand it.

28:35.982 --> 28:40.119
I see myself
on a night in Chicago,

28:40.152 --> 28:42.154
like, 30 years ago.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.456
It was after deadline,

28:44.490 --> 28:47.526
and the office had
cleared out to the bar,

28:47.559 --> 28:51.697
but I stuck around
that night.

28:51.730 --> 28:57.103
I turned in a big feature
and felt like celebrating alone,

28:57.136 --> 28:58.905
so I poured myself
a little something

28:58.938 --> 29:01.173
and I went to the window.

29:04.110 --> 29:07.713
It was snowing outside,
and...

29:07.746 --> 29:10.349
[Voice breaking]
and -- and now, from far away,

29:10.382 --> 29:15.287
I can see that young woman
at the window,

29:15.321 --> 29:20.192
triumphant, in love with
the night and the falling snow,

29:20.226 --> 29:22.862
and she's like this stranger
I'll never meet.

29:22.895 --> 29:26.498
But if I could...

29:26.532 --> 29:29.568
If I could...

29:29.601 --> 29:34.073
If I could
open a door somewhere

29:34.106 --> 29:35.908
and find her...

29:40.880 --> 29:43.782
...I wouldn't be afraid
anymore.

29:43.816 --> 29:48.154
**

29:52.524 --> 29:54.126
Aw, man, wow.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.461
This -- now  this,  this is art.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.996
This is great.
Mm.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.065
Yeah.
I love the ponies.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.367
I hit a trifecta last week
at El Rayo.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.936
[Chuckles] Oh, nice!
The sport of kings!

30:03.970 --> 30:06.505
The track is just one of
my revenue streams. [Laughs]

30:06.538 --> 30:08.975
Oh.

30:09.008 --> 30:13.479
Toast to
Dudley & Son & Daughter.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.848
May you vanquish
all your enemies

30:15.882 --> 30:18.550
and ride again
on the winds of commerce.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.153
[Laughing] I don't know
what the hell I'm saying!

30:21.187 --> 30:23.722
No, it's perfect.
Thank you.

30:23.755 --> 30:25.157
[Glasses clink]
Whoo!

30:25.191 --> 30:26.658
Mm.
[Clears throat]

30:26.692 --> 30:28.094
Mmm. Mmm!

30:28.127 --> 30:29.595
Mmm.

30:29.628 --> 30:33.499
I'm really impressed with your
entrepreneurial spirit.

30:33.532 --> 30:36.068
Getting out there,
knocking on doors.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.237
Yeah, yeah, well, you know,
I gave it a shot,

30:38.270 --> 30:41.507
and, uh, now I'm just tryin'
to take a break.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.977
You know, tryin' to --
tryin' to figure out, uh,

30:45.011 --> 30:47.446
scalability or -- right?
Is that -- whatever.

30:47.479 --> 30:51.650
Um, yeah, it's tough
with my leg, too, so...

30:51.683 --> 30:54.520
There's nothing more important
than health.

30:54.553 --> 30:58.991
And the fastest way to heal
is to stay  fydrated.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.927
Yeah.
You mean "hydrated."

31:00.960 --> 31:02.761
[Both chuckle]

31:02.794 --> 31:05.531
No, I mean "fydrated."

31:05.564 --> 31:07.733
-Oh.
-And staying fydrated

31:07.766 --> 31:12.038
keeps your pores nice
and healthy... [Whispers] FYI.

31:12.071 --> 31:15.507
[Normal voice] Fydro combines
the elemental power

31:15.541 --> 31:16.976
of fire and water.

31:17.009 --> 31:20.079
It's a metaphysical
fydration system

31:20.112 --> 31:24.917
fully optimized with minerals,
auras, and antioxidants.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.385

31:32.358 --> 31:34.961
[Inhales sharply]

31:34.994 --> 31:36.895
It transcends water.

31:36.929 --> 31:41.667
It's the essence of fydration.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.669
Well, thank you.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.637
How'd you like
to take some home with you?

31:45.671 --> 31:46.939
-Oh...
-Uh, sure.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.540
Great!

31:48.574 --> 31:51.243
Do you want the store price
or the insider Mega Deal?

31:51.277 --> 31:52.711
Way more value with
the Mega Deal.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.546
3 cases for 200 bucks.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.948
I'll be right back.

Dud: Wait, I...

31:57.416 --> 31:59.185
Oh, my God.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.987
This whole thing
was a sales pitch, Dud.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.722
It's a pyramid scheme.
Wow, yeah, you know what?

32:03.755 --> 32:05.091
I think somethin's
kinda off with this lady,

32:05.124 --> 32:06.525
and I can always tell,

32:06.558 --> 32:08.127
so I think we should
probably just go.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.929
Yeah. Whoa.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.398
Whew!

32:12.431 --> 32:14.366
Oh, hey, Lenore,
uh, you know,

32:14.400 --> 32:17.669
somethin' just came up,
and we gotta go.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.372
Oh. Okay.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.241
I'll load these into
your car.

32:22.274 --> 32:26.045
No! No. We -- we appreciate
the offer for the Mega Deal.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.746
Mm-hmm.
It's just -- it's not for us.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.482
-Mnh-mnh.
-Yeah.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.053
I knew it.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.688
No good deed goes
unpunished.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.957
I save your life,

32:38.991 --> 32:41.093
I invite you into my home,

32:41.127 --> 32:43.862
and all you do is
insult me!

32:43.895 --> 32:46.932
Okay, whoa! [Chuckles] You
didn't save my life, alright?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.567
The guy wasn't trying
to kill me.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.302
I mean -- I mean, well,
he did try to murder me later,

32:50.336 --> 32:52.171
but that was...
No, it's really out of line

32:52.204 --> 32:54.873
using our dad
to sell us this crap.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.342
Yeah.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.277
Your dad?

32:58.310 --> 33:01.280
Your dad would be so ashamed
of you two!

33:01.313 --> 33:04.550
Yeah?
His -- h-his son is
an unemployed drug addict.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.385
A drug addict?
And his daughter...

Oh, he talked about you like
you were gonna be the queen!

33:09.155 --> 33:12.458

kinda make sure that everything

was still on track, because, um,
'cause I've been getting

34:04.210 --> 34:06.712
a lot of calls from the hospital
about my bill.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.081
What? No one does that
to my client.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.582
N-no one.

34:10.616 --> 34:13.452
I will destroy them,
if that's what you want.

No, no, no. No, no, no.
I don't want that. I just...

34:15.921 --> 34:17.923
You said that you were gonna
take care of all the paperwork

34:17.956 --> 34:19.958
and make sure
all my bills were paid.

34:19.991 --> 34:22.594
That's -- that's it.
Oh, yeah, Dud,
don't worry about that.

34:22.628 --> 34:27.399
No, I have, um, filed a motion
on your behalf

34:27.433 --> 34:30.336
with the Superior Court.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.872
And if they object, then I'll
subpoena the judge,

34:33.905 --> 34:35.741
and we'll take it to
the grand jury.

34:35.774 --> 34:38.977
G-great. Awesome.
That sounds like a plan.

34:53.525 --> 34:57.463
there's anything off
with your lawyer?

34:57.496 --> 34:58.897
You mean my law provider?

34:58.930 --> 35:01.767
She asked me
about the True Lodge.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.236
What the hell do I know about
the True Lodge?

35:04.270 --> 35:06.172
Maybe she's just being thorough.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.639
She asked me
to tell her the name

35:07.673 --> 35:09.375
of the Sovereign Protector
of Lodge 1.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.042
What does that matter to her?

35:11.076 --> 35:13.078
Who is the Sovereign Protector
of Lodge 1?

35:13.111 --> 35:15.381
I don't know.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.984
It's only known by certain
people on certain floors.

35:19.017 --> 35:21.153
My point is, none of that
has anything to do

35:21.187 --> 35:23.121
with your shark attack.

35:23.155 --> 35:27.893

35:27.926 --> 35:30.162

35:33.199 --> 35:35.167
[Door closes]

35:35.201 --> 35:38.670
Well, sorry I'm late
for my...torture session.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.139
I got lost again
on the way down here.

35:41.173 --> 35:44.075
I swear, some of the corridors
upstairs make no sense.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.511
[Scottish accent]
That's by design.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.078
One of Merrill's techniques.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.681
He thought it was good
to feel lost. [Scoffs]

35:49.715 --> 35:52.451
[Coughing] Hmm.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.052
[English accent] Have you had
a chance to read his monograph

35:54.085 --> 35:56.788
on architectural
disorientation?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.890
Clara? Are you in here?

35:58.924 --> 36:00.459
[Whirring, low buzzing]

36:00.492 --> 36:01.960
[Scottish accent]
No, just me.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.463
[Gasps]
No, don't!

36:04.496 --> 36:06.998
**

36:07.032 --> 36:09.568
What the hell?

36:09.601 --> 36:12.304
**

36:12.338 --> 36:16.141
Suppose, Connie,

36:16.174 --> 36:18.644
it's time to bring you
into the True Lodge.

36:18.677 --> 36:23.249
**

36:23.282 --> 36:26.318
You were speedy in name,

36:26.352 --> 36:28.854
but not in fact --

36:28.887 --> 36:32.123
the cheapest of ironies.

36:32.157 --> 36:34.560
Trees are just hairs

36:34.593 --> 36:36.895
on the scalp of the Earth,

36:36.928 --> 36:41.367
and we are lice
crawling through them.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.135
You were the slowest louse,

36:44.169 --> 36:48.206
which was fast enough to
make you a man.

36:50.075 --> 36:53.579
Godspeed, Speedy.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.283
That was, uh...

37:00.151 --> 37:02.321
really nice, Bob.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.855
I don't know if it scans,

37:03.889 --> 37:07.125
but I-I wanted to
lean into the emotion.

37:07.158 --> 37:09.695
Speedy, I'm sorry.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.931
I said he was gonna die
in that chair, and he did.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.902
I said the same thing to Ernie.
I take it back.

37:16.935 --> 37:21.440
It's not your fault, Jeff.
You can't cause it by saying it.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.709
Nobody has that kinda power.

37:23.742 --> 37:27.779
You just foresaw the inevitable.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.583
[Telephone rings in distance]

37:34.820 --> 37:36.254
[Clears throat]

37:36.288 --> 37:38.390
Hey. Hey!

37:38.424 --> 37:40.359
Please stop toying
with me.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.060
What?

37:42.093 --> 37:43.929
Avery thought it would be
so easy, just feed you a story

37:43.962 --> 37:45.697
and -- and then keep finessing
things until I got

37:45.731 --> 37:48.567
all the information I wanted.
But you...

37:48.600 --> 37:51.537
I mean, you had me figured out
from the beginning, didn't you?

37:51.570 --> 37:55.240
Uh, wait. Sorry.
You know Avery?

37:55.273 --> 37:56.742
Okay, just...

37:56.775 --> 37:59.077
You're trying to complete
the Magnum Opus?

37:59.110 --> 38:01.580
N-no, no, no.
The Magnum Opus is a fairy tale.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.850
There is no magical formula
to create gold.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.586
But the scrolls are
still valuable.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.855
[Sighs]
Let me --
okay, let me ask you this.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.457
What do you know
about Bitcoin?

38:11.490 --> 38:13.725
Or -- or cryptocurrency
in general?

38:13.759 --> 38:15.193
Nothing.

38:15.226 --> 38:17.295
Okay, so it's basically
a made-up currency.

38:17.329 --> 38:20.098
Mm-hmm, right, but isn't
all currency made up?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.868
I mean, like, if people believe
lemons are money,

38:22.901 --> 38:25.837
then lemons are money.
Exactly. Right?

38:25.871 --> 38:27.673
So, okay, I don't want to get
too in the weeds on this...
Mm.

38:27.706 --> 38:31.176
...but Bitcoin, it's -- it's --
it's like modern alchemy, right?

38:31.209 --> 38:33.645
You solve a riddle,
and you create gold.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.682
So Avery and I work for
these people who believe

38:36.715 --> 38:39.184
that the original algorithm
for Bitcoin

38:39.217 --> 38:42.153
is based on the scrolls
of Harwood Fritz Merrill.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.189
And, I mean, the True Lodge
set it all in motion,

38:44.222 --> 38:45.991
but we never knew how
or when or where

38:46.024 --> 38:48.894
until I saw the news report
about the mummy,

38:48.927 --> 38:52.097
and I caught a glimpse of this,

38:52.130 --> 38:55.266
which, you know, we know to be
an emblem of the True Lodge.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.835
So I contacted Avery.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.270
He showed up here and he pieced
it all together.

38:59.304 --> 39:00.672
Where is Avery?

39:00.706 --> 39:02.441
Antarctica, but that's not
important now.

39:02.474 --> 39:06.244
Look, this all goes back to
Wallace Smith and Jackie Loomis.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.946
They brought the scrolls here
to Long Beach, right?

39:07.979 --> 39:09.781
They -- they somehow
got in touch

39:09.815 --> 39:11.750
with the engineers at Orbis
and the Parabola Group...

39:11.783 --> 39:13.519
[Laughing]
...and -- and the rest
is kind of hazy,

39:13.552 --> 39:16.788
but what's important is that
whoever has the scrolls

39:16.822 --> 39:21.059
can unlock Bitcoin
and make millions.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.662
Wow. Wow!

39:23.695 --> 39:26.565
So it  is  a formula
for making gold.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.834
That's what it is.
It's a formula for ma--

39:28.867 --> 39:31.837
Not magic gold. I get that.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.439
But, uh...

39:33.472 --> 39:35.441
Wait.
So what about Smith's diary?

39:35.474 --> 39:36.908
Oh, um -- oh, yeah.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.545
You can -- you can
give this back to Blaise.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.046
Oh.
That is, um --

39:41.079 --> 39:42.648
Ooh.
That was a dead end.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.784
But what we need to know now
is where to go in Mexico.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.319
Dud, if you can help us,

39:48.353 --> 39:51.289
we will make you very rich.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.559
[Chuckles]

39:53.592 --> 39:55.994
Yeah.

39:56.027 --> 39:58.497
I mean... [Chuckles]

39:58.530 --> 39:59.998
I was really counting on
that shark money,

40:00.031 --> 40:01.500
you know what I mean?
[Chuckles]

40:01.533 --> 40:03.835
And ya kind of screwed me
on -- on that.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.537
I'm sorry. I am sorry.
That was a scam.

40:05.571 --> 40:08.106
But this --
no, this... [Chuckles]

40:08.139 --> 40:09.641
This is legit.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.843
I mean, the kind of money
that I am talking about,

40:11.877 --> 40:14.513
I mean, it could...

40:14.546 --> 40:17.883
[Whispers] it could
solve a lot of problems.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.652

I would like to start
with my father, Mitch Miller,

No.
What is wrong with you?

41:44.069 --> 41:45.937
You  should be apologizing.

41:47.806 --> 41:49.507
I have a temper.

41:49.541 --> 41:53.779
I didn't want the night
to go that way, I swear.

41:53.812 --> 41:56.514
That's not an apology.
I don't do apologies.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.650
I don't care.

41:58.684 --> 42:04.590
I just wanna know what else
my dad said about me.

42:06.291 --> 42:09.695

I don't wanna
single somebody out.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.694
But maybe -- I don't know,
maybe it's because we're sad

43:15.727 --> 43:18.797
because we got laid off
at our job at Orbis.

43:18.830 --> 43:21.532

we got evicted

and we had to move
into the back of our pot shop.

a -- an insane $3,000 bar tab,
you know?

43:28.206 --> 43:30.475

Caddy's in the shop, you know,

43:30.508 --> 43:32.243
and our -- our girlfriend left
the country.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.579
Or maybe because our wife
had an affair,

and she left the country --
Dud, really not the time.

43:39.885 --> 43:42.253
We kept the doors open,

43:42.287 --> 43:45.390
but hasn't been the same.

since Larry died,

You're just gonna have to
take my word on this,

I am a major player

in a vast
international conspiracy.

-Now -- yeah, and -- and, okay.

are somewhere in Mexico.

go get 'em, okay,

here, but this place is haunted.

45:21.119 --> 45:22.954
[Mouth full] It was a ghost!

45:22.988 --> 45:24.455
Blaise, tell him.

45:24.489 --> 45:27.692
I might've suggested
the possibility of a visitation,

45:27.725 --> 45:29.494
but that doesn't
necessarily mean that

45:29.527 --> 45:31.963
Larry manifested
in the material plane.

45:31.997 --> 45:33.865
It's -- you know,
it's kind of a gray area.

45:33.899 --> 45:36.201
[Thud in distance]
[Electricity crackling]

45:36.234 --> 45:37.635
What was that?

45:37.668 --> 45:40.671
It's Scott.
He's in the Sanctum.

45:40.705 --> 45:43.674
[Grunting, clattering]

45:43.708 --> 45:46.711
**

45:50.916 --> 45:53.351
Scott: What's going on?

45:53.384 --> 45:56.387
[Doorknob rattling]

45:56.421 --> 45:59.424
**

46:05.030 --> 46:07.933
[All scream]

46:07.966 --> 46:09.901
Who the hell are you?!

46:09.935 --> 46:12.337
Ernie: It's El Confidente.

46:12.370 --> 46:14.572
I came up through the tunnel
in the trailer.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.008
Big Ben:
Wait, we've got a tunnel?

46:19.177 --> 46:21.512
You owe me a drink, Ernesto.

46:21.546 --> 46:24.382
You must be Dud.

46:24.415 --> 46:26.717
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

46:26.751 --> 46:29.287
I've been dreamin'
about you.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.923
[Laughs]
Let's get a drink.

46:31.957 --> 46:33.391
-Okay!
-Man, come on!

46:33.424 --> 46:34.860
[Laughs]

46:34.893 --> 46:37.628
**

46:40.932 --> 46:43.935
**

46:50.741 --> 46:53.744

47:00.685 --> 47:03.688
