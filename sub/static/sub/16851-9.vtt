WEBVTT

00:00.501 --> 00:01.734
[applause]

00:04.038 --> 00:07.175
[piano music]

00:10.811 --> 00:12.580
Welcome.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.516
If you'll lend me
your patience for a spell

00:15.583 --> 00:17.951
I'd like to tell you
about a little place

00:18.018 --> 00:20.020
called Children's Hospital.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.990
It's a whole day's ride
from the big city

00:23.057 --> 00:25.993
and things move
a little slower here.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.129
Now, this is
the main nurse's station.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.897
It's not much to see, really.

00:29.963 --> 00:33.934
There's a few phones, uh,
some patients' files

00:34.001 --> 00:38.038
some scattered medicines,
a few pads of post-it notes

00:38.106 --> 00:42.743
a vinyl copy of Rolling Stones'
"Tattoo You."

00:42.810 --> 00:47.081
Some pencils, a cup or two
to hold said pencils

00:47.148 --> 00:49.783
hair clips,
some old get-well balloons.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.586
A magazine that's been
thumbed through more times

00:52.653 --> 00:56.090
than my cousin Samantha.

00:56.157 --> 00:59.026
It must be time
to start a new day.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.061
[mid-tempo orchestral music]

01:01.129 --> 01:03.164
(narrator)
 Oh, lookee here.
 It's the chief.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.634
I'd like to say that she runs
 this place with an iron fist

01:06.700 --> 01:09.503
but, truth to be told,
 her fists are weak and useless

01:09.570 --> 01:11.339
just like the rest of her body.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.307
She appears confident,
 but inside

01:13.374 --> 01:15.676
she longs to be able to dance.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.679
[music continues]

01:20.681 --> 01:22.650
Ow!

01:22.716 --> 01:25.119
- Morning, Dr. Richie.
- Morning, ma'am.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.954
Those new tongue depressors
come in yet?

01:27.020 --> 01:30.090
[chuckles]
Not yet, chief. Sy's picking
them up this morning.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.025
That's Dr. Glenn Richie.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.661
He's always
telling it like it is

01:33.727 --> 01:36.297
with his trademark
sense of humor.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.899
Oh, and he's a Jew.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.935
Oh, Dr. Valarie Flame.

01:42.002 --> 01:45.038
Now, normally, if you're in bed
and something's on fire

01:45.105 --> 01:47.175
you're gonna want
to put that fire out

01:47.241 --> 01:50.144
but in the case of
Dr. Valarie Flame

01:50.211 --> 01:52.813
this is one fire
you don't want to put out.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.615
You want to have sex with it.

01:54.682 --> 01:58.051
But what you might not know
about Valerie if you didn't know

01:58.118 --> 02:02.055
her very well is
that she has a dick.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.925
That's hospital administrator
 Sy Mittleman.

02:04.992 --> 02:08.362
He's five years past retirement.
He should have left years ago.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.364
I'm back from the
medical warehouse.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.800
A 100 jars
and one tongue depressor.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.637
- Am I right?
- No, Sy. The other way 'round.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.672
Oh, I'm sure it was
my fault, Sy.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.409
I-I probably mixed things
up on the order forms.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.644
- Sorry, everyone.
- Poor Cat.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.914
She's covered for Sy so often,
 she should be the lead singer

02:26.980 --> 02:28.749
in a Sy cover band.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.719
And here are the young lovers,
 Owen and Lola.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.355
Lola is the prettiest
flower you ever had the pleasure

02:34.422 --> 02:36.023
to stick your nose
inside of.

02:36.089 --> 02:41.262
Owen...well, Owen is known far
and wide for his bedside manner.

02:41.329 --> 02:44.064
[screaming]

02:44.131 --> 02:46.934
They're planning a June
 wedding, here at Children's.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.404
You've met all the important
people in our little hospital.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.139
Nobody else worth mentioning.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.174
Ahem.
Um..

02:54.242 --> 02:56.910
Uh, Blake Downs,
clown doctor, et cetera.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.246
Oh, who's that over there?

02:58.312 --> 03:00.514
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Can I help you?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.250
I'm looking for
Dr. Owen Maestro.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.652
- Well, who's asking?
- Name's Murphy.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.587
I represent the largest
healthcare facility

03:06.654 --> 03:08.789
in the big city, Laser Hospital.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.859
Good for you, Mr. Murphy. I've
the largest elbows in my family.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.094
That and a bus ticket
takes me downtown.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.363
[laughter]

03:15.429 --> 03:16.830
(both)
Elbows.

03:16.897 --> 03:20.668
Doctor, if I could just
have five minutes of your time.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.136
We saw the news reports about
the emergency liver transplants

03:23.203 --> 03:27.375
you did at the dance marathon.
We want you to come work for us.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.610
We've a sports gym on site
with power spinning.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.613
A food court, and we will
give you your own Corolla.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.882
Sounds like a blast, Mr. Murphy,
I'm not interested.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.652
- Our softball team is 10-0.
- I lost both shoulders in war.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.456
We'll pay you 5% more
than you're making right now.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.958
How many percents
was that again?

03:45.025 --> 03:47.795
If you're having trouble with
your internship, you come to me.

03:47.861 --> 03:51.231
I'll be there for you.
My name is Earl Sweatshirt.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.233
[Cat laughing]

03:53.301 --> 03:56.036
Oh, Sy!
What a joker.

03:56.103 --> 04:00.107
Why, writing all that gibberish
up there as a joke

04:00.173 --> 04:02.175
to break the ice
among the interns.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.878
Oh, it's classic Sy.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.947
Y'all run along now, okay?

04:07.014 --> 04:09.650
Shoo!
Go on! Git!

04:09.717 --> 04:11.485
[clicks tongue]

04:11.552 --> 04:14.054
Sy, I can't keep
covering for you.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.890
I'm going home now.
I'm gonna be better tomorrow.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.091
[sighs]

04:18.158 --> 04:19.493
Bye-bye.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.199
This can't go on, Cat.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.303
I've spoken to the board, and
they've given us the authority

04:29.370 --> 04:30.638
to shoot Sy.

04:30.704 --> 04:34.041
- What?
- I mean force him to retire.

04:34.107 --> 04:38.111
But we're all he has!
Oh, chief, give him a chance!

04:38.178 --> 04:40.748
Okay, but if he screws up again

04:40.814 --> 04:43.216
we are shooting him
or forcing him to retire

04:43.283 --> 04:45.486
whichever one it was
we landed on. I forgot.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.555
Everyone!
Everyone!

04:47.621 --> 04:49.957
Gather around, please.
I've an announcement to make.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.893
I've decided to take
a job at Laser Hospital.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.894
[all gasp]

04:53.961 --> 04:55.963
Before you start
getting all mushy on me

04:56.029 --> 04:59.767
it's time for me to start mixing
with higher-level persons.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.803
[melancholic orchestral music]

05:02.870 --> 05:04.405
Oh!

05:04.472 --> 05:06.607
Lola, wait!

05:06.674 --> 05:10.478
So you're leaving, just like
that? What about our wedding?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.946
Lola, you're a wonderful girl,
and although you have

05:13.013 --> 05:16.417
many, many faults, I'm quite
sure you can hook in a new man

05:16.484 --> 05:18.218
before he discovers them.

05:18.285 --> 05:21.822
Oh, no man will want me now!
I'm used up! I'm damaged goods!

05:21.889 --> 05:25.626
Oh, there, there. Someone might.
Maybe there's a fetish for that.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.827
Oh!

05:26.894 --> 05:28.696
[slam]

05:28.762 --> 05:30.564
[sobbing]

05:33.401 --> 05:36.804
Goodbye, Lola.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.707
And goodbye,
Children's Hospital.

05:43.777 --> 05:48.281
Now, Laser Hospital is
 a 50-story tower in the center

05:48.348 --> 05:51.652
of the big city with all
 the latest technologies

05:51.719 --> 05:54.755
like bone rotation
 and dick belt replacements.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.557
You're seven seconds late,
Dr. Maestro.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.727
I'm awful sorry about that, sir,
but there was an accident

05:59.793 --> 06:02.596
and, luckily, I was there
to save a young girl's life.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.466
As per hospital policy,
you get a punch in the gut.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.468
- Oof!
- Now, here's your I.D. card.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.703
Swipe it when you get
to work, every hour

06:09.770 --> 06:11.772
throughout the day
and middle of the night.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.807
Well, I'm off to sample
some sample drugs.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.510
Maestro, what say you
and me grab a drink later

06:16.577 --> 06:18.045
alright, loser?

06:18.111 --> 06:19.447
[laughs]

06:22.916 --> 06:25.453
It's the fruit punch
social tonight.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.221
Time to get ready so we
can meet us some gents.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.191
I'm gonna wear the shortest
skirt my mom will allow.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.526
Well, I can't.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.762
I've to go through
all of Sy's budgets

06:34.828 --> 06:36.764
and erase all the poop stains.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.800
And my days of romance
are long gone.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.936
I'll just sit here and darn
some of these old socks

06:43.003 --> 06:44.938
try to masturbate.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.643
[up-tempo techno music]

06:49.710 --> 06:52.345
Meanwhile, in the big city,
 Owen hits the town

06:52.412 --> 06:54.347
with his new friends.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.349
Hey, this pan-galactic
gargle blaster

06:56.416 --> 06:58.418
will keep you going
all night! Let's go!

06:58.486 --> 07:01.622
[music continues]

07:13.534 --> 07:15.936
(Murphy)
'Hey, Maestro! Come join us!'

07:22.409 --> 07:23.544
[all laughing]

07:23.611 --> 07:24.945
[music stops]

07:34.655 --> 07:36.690
You know what I wish for?

07:36.757 --> 07:40.761
I wish that wherever
Owen is, he's happy.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.831
I wish that Lola
finds true love again

07:43.897 --> 07:46.333
that Sy regains his sanity

07:46.399 --> 07:50.103
and that Cat
finally finds peace.

07:50.170 --> 07:55.175
And as for me,
well...I have a wish

07:55.242 --> 07:58.546
but my wish is only a fantasy.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.749
[mid-tempo orchestral music]

08:08.055 --> 08:10.023
Does this thing come off?
I like it.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.060
Yeah, get that off.
Ooh, that's better.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.862
That would be rad.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.897
You have to eat
some real food, Sy.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.700
Now, toothpaste
and darts is not a meal.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.935
We need to end this
once and for all.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.405
Sy, your days at
Children's Hospital are over.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.107
- Go home!
- Oh. Okay.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.943
But first could you show me
to Liz Taylor's dressing room?

08:30.010 --> 08:33.212
I'd like to smooch her
up goodbye. Va-va-voom.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.347
Oh, Sy.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.885
Meanwhile, over
 at Laser Hospital..

08:37.951 --> 08:41.221
Here you go, kid. Have a
lollipop. Best medicine I know.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.024
You know what? I'm starting
to feel better already.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.360
Dr. Maestro! We treat kids
with medicine here.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.362
Save the bedside manner
for the prostitutes

08:49.429 --> 08:51.999
which the hospital provides
you at a discount if you

08:52.065 --> 08:53.834
meet your revenue quotas.
Are we clear?

08:53.901 --> 08:55.569
- Well--
- Good to hear it.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.806
To make sure that you know
I'm serious, I'm gonna punch.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.940
Oof!

09:00.007 --> 09:01.809
[melancholic piano music]

09:01.875 --> 09:05.779
Time passed, three long days
 to be exact.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.948
Two days is nothing, but three?

09:08.015 --> 09:10.083
Well, that changes a body.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.253
I wonder how Sy is doing
ever since he was forced

09:13.320 --> 09:16.890
to retire those many
three days ago.

09:16.957 --> 09:21.094
I wonder where he is
right...now!

09:21.161 --> 09:22.295
[wind gusting]

09:24.031 --> 09:25.733
[groaning]

09:25.799 --> 09:28.201
Oh, my God! It's Sy!

09:28.268 --> 09:32.139
Oh, what's the matter, you?
Ah, shut up your face!

09:32.205 --> 09:33.941
Sy is sick with something.

09:34.007 --> 09:37.177
It's more like a textbook case
of not being needed.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.446
Poor Sy. Maybe we shouldn't
have shot him.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.581
Well, what a shame.

09:41.649 --> 09:45.018
Maybe what old Sy needs is some
of my healing bedside manner.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.187
- 'Owen! You're back!'
- What's your name, sir?

09:47.254 --> 09:50.590
- Tobey Maguire.
- How about a lollipop, Tobey?

09:50.658 --> 09:52.660
[slow orchestral music]

09:53.761 --> 09:55.362
Who's Tobey?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.331
Hey, wait a minute!
What's going on? Where am I?

09:58.398 --> 10:00.400
The old Sy!
Oh, he's cured!

10:00.467 --> 10:03.303
You know, I learned something
when I was at Laser Hospital.

10:03.370 --> 10:07.074
It's not about how many fancy
machines you have in your room

10:07.140 --> 10:09.609
or who made the suit
you're wearing, Armani.

10:09.677 --> 10:13.280
But enough of my babbling on.
We've got a wedding to plan.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.581
[all gasp]

10:14.648 --> 10:17.818
Mazel tov! Mazel tov!

10:20.754 --> 10:22.289
And that's it.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.091
They were married that night

10:24.157 --> 10:28.061
with a clearheaded Sy
officiating.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.898
And chief never did
end up fulfilling

10:30.964 --> 10:34.668
her dream of a three-way
with those two bisexual dancers

10:34.735 --> 10:36.704
but maybe one day she will.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.406
That was a great
story, grandpa Owen.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.607
Wait.

10:40.674 --> 10:41.875
Owen?

10:41.942 --> 10:43.877
Were you that
young groom, grandpa?

10:43.944 --> 10:47.080
No, no, no. I was one
of the black bisexual dancers.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.317
Oh, okay.
Wow. So many questions.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.552
Well, like I said, sweetie,
that's a story
