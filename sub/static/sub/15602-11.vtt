<i>Previously on "Green Lantern"...</i>

00:24.960 --> 00:26.294
Red Lanterns?

00:26.362 --> 00:28.963
Their power rings fire
some sort of red energy.

00:29.031 --> 00:30.298
They have rings?

00:30.366 --> 00:32.634
- Powered by what?
- Best guess?

00:32.701 --> 00:35.303
A huge desire to mash us all into pulp.

00:35.371 --> 00:36.404
Uhh!

[beeping]

01:10.739 --> 01:12.874
[dinging]

01:18.881 --> 01:21.015
Not working.

01:21.083 --> 01:25.053
Are you using galactic
6 numeric translation of the phrase?

01:25.120 --> 01:28.356
Of course.
You dare question me, Veon?

01:28.424 --> 01:31.559
My guard got the code directly
from the prisoner's mind.

01:31.627 --> 01:33.895
It's...it's not our fault.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.397
Atrocitus will not tolerate excuses.

01:36.465 --> 01:38.700
We need that code to open the gateway.

01:38.767 --> 01:41.236
The entire invasion depends upon it.

01:41.303 --> 01:44.906
So do our lives.

01:47.743 --> 01:50.144
Are you sure none of you have seen it?

01:50.212 --> 01:52.814
It's a Lantern battery
for crying out loud.

01:52.882 --> 01:55.516
It's not like it grew legs and ran off.

01:55.584 --> 01:59.520
I can't believe you, Jordan.
First you forget to charge your ring,

01:59.588 --> 02:01.890
and now you lose your battery
like some rookie.

02:01.957 --> 02:04.859
I am receiving an incoming
transmission from Oa.

02:04.927 --> 02:07.095
Guardian Appa Ali Apsa.

02:07.162 --> 02:09.697
After what he did to Ganthet, let
it go to voicemail or something.

02:09.764 --> 02:12.934
I don't feel like talking to that
backstabbing blue munchkin pain in the...

02:13.002 --> 02:14.168
Ahem. Jordan.

02:14.236 --> 02:18.439
<i>Yes, communication with you, 2814,
is equally unpleasant.</i>

02:18.507 --> 02:20.708
<i>However, the Guardians have need of you.</i>

02:20.776 --> 02:24.078
<i>We have deciphered more of the red
lantern plans you obtained from shard.</i>

02:24.146 --> 02:27.015
<i>The invasion will begin
sooner than expected.</i>

02:27.082 --> 02:30.451
<i>Atrocitus plans to enter Guardian
space using the Lighthouse.</i>

02:30.519 --> 02:32.220
That what now?

02:32.288 --> 02:34.522
<i>The Lighthouse was created
millions of years ago</i>

02:34.590 --> 02:37.525
<i>by a lost civilization as a way
to travel through the Maelstrom,</i>

02:37.593 --> 02:41.729
<i>The asteroid barrier separating the
forgotten zone from Guardian space.</i>

02:41.797 --> 02:43.264
<i>When those ancients vanished,</i>

02:43.332 --> 02:45.099
<i>the secret of the Lighthouse was lost,</i>

02:45.167 --> 02:47.402
<i>sealing for countless millennia.</i>

02:47.469 --> 02:50.638
<i>Some years ago a Green Lantern
archeologist named Tauverus</i>

02:50.706 --> 02:52.407
<i>made the long trek to the frontier</i>

02:52.474 --> 02:54.142
<i>in hopes of finding the secret code</i>

02:54.209 --> 02:56.411
<i>that would activate
the long dormant Lighthouse.</i>

02:56.478 --> 02:59.747
<i>Unfortunately, he disappeared
without a trace.</i>

02:59.815 --> 03:02.150
And you're telling us this why?

03:02.217 --> 03:05.553
<i>The Red Lantern armada is
headed full speed for the gate.</i>

03:05.621 --> 03:08.156
<i>We believe Atrocitus
may already have the code.</i>

03:08.223 --> 03:11.392
<i>If his armada crosses the
Maelstrom into Oan space,</i>

03:11.460 --> 03:14.228
<i>they will destroy
everything in their power.</i>

03:14.296 --> 03:17.886
<i>Your job, Green Lanterns,
is to get to the Lighthouse first</i>

03:17.962 --> 03:21.836
<i>and destroy it by any means necessary.</i>

03:21.904 --> 03:25.239
It's too bad we can't just ask
this Tauverus what the code is

03:25.307 --> 03:27.508
so we can destroy the
Lighthouse from the inside out.

03:27.576 --> 03:29.677
We can do precisely that.

03:29.745 --> 03:31.446
While interfaced with
the security system

03:31.513 --> 03:34.682
on the prison asteroid,
I downloaded their records.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.486
An inmate named Tauverus is in
fact being held captive there.

03:49.164 --> 03:52.033
<i>Jordan, I hope you remember
how these yellow stones</i>

03:52.101 --> 03:54.068
<i>make our rings completely useless.</i>

03:54.136 --> 03:55.737
Don't sweat it.
There's no one to fight.

03:55.804 --> 03:57.372
It's a friendly prison now, remember?

03:57.439 --> 04:00.375
- Trust me.
- I hate it when you say that.

04:00.442 --> 04:02.643
<i>Green Lanterns!</i>

04:02.711 --> 04:05.880
<i>You have been gone too
many days. Too many!</i>

04:05.948 --> 04:10.018
And you promised Goggan that
Goggan was only temporary warden.

04:10.085 --> 04:13.821
Goggan work, work, work.
Goggan is a slave to work.

04:13.889 --> 04:16.124
Maybe prison is better.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.625
Goggan, this is important.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.226
We're looking for a prison that was here

04:19.293 --> 04:21.161
when Myglam and his
spiders ran the place.

04:21.230 --> 04:23.831
His name is Tauverus, a Green Lantern.

04:23.899 --> 04:29.404
The records indicate he is being
held on level H, sublevel 6D.

04:37.228 --> 04:40.297
My circuits are
experiencing micro failures.

04:40.365 --> 04:42.833
The yellow stones are very draining.

04:42.901 --> 04:48.071
I'll take her back to Goggan's office.
She'll be safer there.

04:54.913 --> 04:57.347
Tauverus, I presume.

04:57.415 --> 05:00.584
Sad, sad. Very sad.

05:10.395 --> 05:13.764
Death by mind-altering torture device.

05:13.832 --> 05:15.799
If you thought you were going to die,

05:15.867 --> 05:19.403
wouldn't you find a way
to pass on an important secret?

05:21.539 --> 05:26.343
Wait.
Tauverus did leave us a message.

05:26.411 --> 05:30.314
"If you want the code
to the Lighthouse, free Byth Rok."

05:30.381 --> 05:32.482
[shudders]

05:32.550 --> 05:35.118
Goggan, did you just ink yourself?

05:35.186 --> 05:38.322
Byth Rok is a prisoner,
a Thanagarian prisoner.

05:38.389 --> 05:41.658
Horrible, horrible birdman.
Dangerous! Brutal!

05:41.726 --> 05:44.094
We put them in there, the birdcage.

05:44.162 --> 05:47.698
Guards go in, but guards
don't come back out.

05:47.765 --> 05:50.133
Hawkmen?
I love Thanagarians.

05:50.201 --> 05:52.002
They're real soldiers...

05:52.070 --> 05:55.806
Organized, disciplined, and very clean.

05:55.874 --> 05:58.041
[all shouting]

06:04.082 --> 06:06.850
Clean? I don't think
they're even paper trained.

06:06.918 --> 06:09.820
Outlaws and pirates.
Pirates and outlaws.

06:09.888 --> 06:13.056
All with prices on their heads
and death sentences.

06:13.124 --> 06:14.491
Wasting time.

06:14.559 --> 06:17.327
Go in, pull this Byth Rok out,
and get some answers.

06:17.395 --> 06:20.931
Good idea... for you.
Goggan will watch from here.

06:32.844 --> 06:34.611
Ahh!

06:35.914 --> 06:38.949
We're looking for
a Thanagarian named Byth Rok.

06:39.017 --> 06:43.220
I'm Byth Rok,
Valiant leader of these men.

06:43.288 --> 06:46.723
But temporarily not in charge.
A minor setback.

06:46.791 --> 06:50.394
Right.
Look, we want...

06:50.461 --> 06:51.929
Shh. The code to the Lighthouse

06:51.996 --> 06:54.531
to get through the Maelstrom.
I know. Keep it down.

06:54.599 --> 06:57.301
If these cutthroats think
you're here for something I have,

06:57.368 --> 06:59.436
they're gonna want their share.

07:00.972 --> 07:03.974
So, Tauverus didn't make it.

07:03.932 --> 07:07.367
Poor guy.
We shared a cell, you know.

07:07.435 --> 07:10.404
He left the code with me 'cause
he knew I was a tough nut to crack.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.973
Enough noise.
You're coming with us.

07:13.041 --> 07:16.109
Not likely. They're not gonna
let you walk out of here with me.

07:16.177 --> 07:17.778
And I don't think
your Green Lantern rings work

07:17.846 --> 07:20.614
with all this yellow ore around,
so you can't blast your way out.

07:20.682 --> 07:22.950
But you have a suggestion.

07:23.017 --> 07:25.452
All you have to do is
challenge Bumpy to a fight.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.621
Bumpy's the usurper in charge.

07:27.689 --> 07:31.058
Don't worry, should be easy
for a big, tough guy like you.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.994
You look like a fighter judging
by that face full of scar tissue.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.796
Or were you born that way?

07:35.864 --> 07:38.732
Save it for Bumpy.

07:38.800 --> 07:43.136
Got a challenger here.
This big flatfoot wants to fight Bumpy.

07:43.204 --> 07:45.672
The wager?
He wins, I go free.

07:45.740 --> 07:49.710
He loses, you get to take
my new friends here prisoner.

07:49.777 --> 07:51.879
[all chanting "fight"]

07:59.429 --> 08:01.763
[all chanting "fight"] 

08:01.831 --> 08:04.132
Wait, wait, wait.
Nobody's agreed to that.

08:04.200 --> 08:08.570
Don't worry, Jordan,
this will be over real quick.

08:11.774 --> 08:14.042
<i>Come on!
You can beat him.</i>

08:18.414 --> 08:20.916
[growls]

08:22.151 --> 08:24.319
[both grunting]

08:33.863 --> 08:35.464
Your big man can really take a hit.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.799
- Oh, he'll win.
- No, not a chance.

08:37.866 --> 08:39.568
Bumpy can't be beat, not like that.

08:39.635 --> 08:42.571
His armor's made of Imp metal,
he's invincible,

08:42.639 --> 08:44.806
and he cheats.

08:46.309 --> 08:47.643
Uhh!

08:52.515 --> 08:55.317
[grunts]

08:55.385 --> 08:58.487
Uhh!

08:58.554 --> 09:00.289
[growls]

09:03.326 --> 09:07.996
Dirty... flying...
[mutters]

09:08.064 --> 09:10.232
Nicely done.
Nicely done.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.667
Now, how about double or nothing?

09:11.734 --> 09:14.836
My man here, this skinny Green Lantern,
wants to fight Bumpy.

09:14.904 --> 09:16.672
Avenge his friend's honor and all that.

09:16.739 --> 09:20.609
If, by some miracle, he wins,
not only do I go free,

09:20.677 --> 09:23.345
but I get to be your
glorious leader once again.

09:23.413 --> 09:26.248
And what do we get when I win?

09:26.316 --> 09:30.986
If skinny here loses, we
forfeit our lives. All of them.

09:31.054 --> 09:32.487
Are you kidding?

09:32.555 --> 09:34.356
Your lives were forfeit
the moment you walked in.

09:34.424 --> 09:36.258
The only way out is if I'm in charge.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.327
What about it, Thanagarians?

09:38.394 --> 09:39.528
<i>Yeah!</i>

09:39.595 --> 09:41.730
[all cheering]

09:45.034 --> 09:47.436
Grr!

09:47.503 --> 09:49.604
[shouting and cheering]

09:49.672 --> 09:52.641
One sec.
One second.

09:52.709 --> 09:55.210
Look, under confidence has
never been a problem for me,

09:55.278 --> 09:57.045
but my ring doesn't work here,

09:57.113 --> 10:00.048
and old Bumpy just wiped the
floor and ceiling with Kilowog,

10:00.116 --> 10:02.884
who taught me most of what
I know about fighting hand to hand.

10:03.753 --> 10:05.420
I got you covered.

10:05.488 --> 10:07.856
Bumpy can't see out of his right eye.

10:07.924 --> 10:11.560
Use that to get on his back and hit
him really hard between the wings.

10:11.627 --> 10:13.462
That's his weak spot.
It'll put him down.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.898
If you knew his weak spot, why
didn't you finish him off before this?

10:16.966 --> 10:19.501
Oh, that's how I ended up here.
He saw me coming.

10:19.569 --> 10:21.036
My wings are just too big and beautiful

10:21.104 --> 10:22.738
for even a half-blind lughead to miss.

10:22.805 --> 10:24.673
You're scrawny.
He won't see you.

10:24.741 --> 10:25.874
Grr!

10:25.942 --> 10:29.411
- This had better work.
- Trust me.

10:30.480 --> 10:35.384
Well, strange being on the other
side of that saying for a change.

10:35.451 --> 10:37.419
[growls]

10:37.487 --> 10:39.488
[gasps]

10:39.555 --> 10:41.423
Ahh!

10:41.491 --> 10:43.658
[both grunting]

11:09.318 --> 11:10.452
Uhh!

11:10.520 --> 11:13.422
Ahh!

11:17.093 --> 11:20.195
[groans]
Did I win?

11:25.535 --> 11:29.271
Fellow, Thanagarians,
It's good to be back on top.

11:29.338 --> 11:31.139
I am the King!

11:31.207 --> 11:33.375
[all cheering]

11:35.845 --> 11:39.047
Come on, your majesty, we had a deal.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.917
The code to the Lighthouse,
if you please.

11:41.984 --> 11:43.518
I am not pleased.

11:43.586 --> 11:46.588
I've had a little thinksy about it,
and I've altered the deal.

11:46.656 --> 11:50.325
How about I pluck your feathers
and roast you like a fat hen.

11:50.359 --> 11:53.128
Easy, Kilowog.
Let's hear the birdman out.

11:53.196 --> 11:56.131
Now that I'm the leader of my group,
I need to think about my men.

11:56.199 --> 11:59.434
They're a proud but simple folk
and need to be taken care of.

11:59.502 --> 12:00.869
Touching.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.938
So in exchange for
the code to the Lighthouse,

12:03.005 --> 12:05.407
I want freedom for myself,
freedom for my men,

12:05.475 --> 12:08.443
and Tauverus' Green Lantern ring.

12:08.511 --> 12:14.149
- How about you take it from me?
- Deal.

12:14.217 --> 12:16.852
You realize the ring ran
out of energy a long time ago,

12:16.919 --> 12:19.254
and even if it were charged,
you couldn't use it.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.289
I'll take my chances.

12:21.357 --> 12:24.659
I mean, look at it.
Such fine Oan craftsmanship.

12:24.727 --> 12:26.895
[alarm sounds]

12:30.133 --> 12:33.702
Oh! That's bad.
Very bad.

12:37.707 --> 12:42.878
<i>This is Bleez of the Red Lantern corps. </i>
Prepare for our arrival.

12:47.307 --> 12:49.008
<i>We demand to see
the warden immediately, </i>

12:49.075 --> 12:51.410
or we will kill him and everyone else.

12:51.478 --> 12:53.446
I'll give you one guess
what they're here for.

12:53.513 --> 12:54.713
You've got to get me out of here now.

12:54.781 --> 12:56.682
Right now.
Those guys are trouble.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.652
- What about your men?
- Them? Forget them.

12:59.719 --> 13:01.720
They just had me chained
for a wall for crying out loud.

13:01.788 --> 13:05.591
Don't worry, I got an idea.
Warden, you're fired.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.027
Oh, thank you.
Thank you! Thank you!

13:08.094 --> 13:11.597
They just said they wanted to see
and probably kill the warden.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.733
Well, we'll just have
to hire a new warden.

13:25.579 --> 13:27.847
Where warden?

13:29.616 --> 13:31.817
You're talking to him.

13:31.885 --> 13:36.655
Not talking, ordering.
Take us to Tauverus now.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.136
Jordan, you can't really
believe this pirate

13:51.204 --> 13:53.239
is gonna willingly give us the code.

13:53.306 --> 13:56.842
Trust me. Hey, it does
feel better when I say it.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.410
Byth, we accept your terms.

13:58.478 --> 14:01.413
We free you and your men,
but the ring stays with us.

14:05.051 --> 14:07.286
Where I come from, we like
to look a man in the eyes

14:07.354 --> 14:11.290
when we shake on a deal.
Your helmet.

14:11.358 --> 14:15.194
By the way, I'm in the market for
a new wife, and I'm not too picky.

14:15.262 --> 14:17.696
My eighth wife, Mailbok, was a Salatio.

14:17.764 --> 14:20.868
Word to the wise,
never marry a Salatian. She...

14:20.958 --> 14:23.302
Ahem.
Byth, the code.

14:23.370 --> 14:26.805
Oh, right.

14:26.873 --> 14:29.375
Remember this well. It's
your key to the Lighthouse

14:29.442 --> 14:30.910
and past the Maelstrom.

14:30.977 --> 14:35.681
Broadcast "Stretch the hunter's
bow and aim true" in gau 7 numeric.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.116
You'll be good to go.

14:37.183 --> 14:39.685
Thanks.
Now, let's get you out of here.

14:51.197 --> 14:53.031
This way.

14:57.604 --> 14:59.538
Kilowog, keep an eye on Byth Rok.

14:59.606 --> 15:02.708
Make sure he's...
Aw, nords.

15:03.226 --> 15:06.395
<i>Attention, Red Lanterns.
This is Byth Rok.</i>

15:06.462 --> 15:08.397
I'm having a prison sale.

15:08.464 --> 15:10.032
<i>Hottest item on the menu?</i>

15:10.099 --> 15:13.468
<i>The secret code to the
oh, so lovely Lighthouse.</i>

15:13.536 --> 15:15.637
<i>So come down
and let's make a deal.</i>

15:15.705 --> 15:17.572
<i>I am open for business.</i>

15:17.640 --> 15:20.242
Something tells me we better leave.
And fast.

15:20.309 --> 15:23.145
What will you do about Byth Rok?

15:23.212 --> 15:24.446
We don't have to worry about him.

15:24.514 --> 15:27.315
Sounds like he's more than
capable of making his own deal.

15:27.383 --> 15:30.585
Too true.
The only problem is

15:30.653 --> 15:33.922
you Green Lanterns are part of my deal.

15:38.995 --> 15:41.596
For me?
You shouldn't have.

15:41.664 --> 15:44.332
But since you did, I like it.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.034
[growls]

15:46.102 --> 15:49.337
Give us the code to the
Lighthouse this instant.

15:49.405 --> 15:51.239
With pleasure, beautiful.

15:51.307 --> 15:54.843
The code phrase is,
"wings of life, fly to oblivion"

15:54.911 --> 15:57.913
in gau 3 numerical, of course.
That's very important.

15:57.980 --> 16:00.048
Now get out of my sight.

16:00.116 --> 16:04.152
If we catch you anywhere near
this sector, we'll skin you alive.

16:04.220 --> 16:07.222
Your command is my greatest wish.

16:14.931 --> 16:17.766
<i>Kiss my wingtips, suckers.</i>

16:30.446 --> 16:32.848
And now for the real code.

16:32.915 --> 16:35.884
"Red dwarf born of gauman Nebula."

16:35.952 --> 16:41.957
Translate to galactic 6 numeric.
And broadcast.

16:49.632 --> 16:51.766
[cackles]

16:53.703 --> 16:56.705
[gasps]

16:56.772 --> 17:00.075
Thank you very much,
Byth Rok, for the real code.

17:00.143 --> 17:02.310
Nice work, Aya.

17:02.378 --> 17:05.547
Mind control.
You... you tricked me.

17:05.615 --> 17:07.915
Me? That's low.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.986
No, we made sure you lived
up to your end of the bargain.

17:11.053 --> 17:13.421
And now we'll live up to ours.

17:13.489 --> 17:15.656
[growling]

17:19.295 --> 17:22.797
Is anyone forgetting the
Red Lanterns all over the place?

17:22.865 --> 17:27.301
No, but I have a plan.
Trust me.

17:30.473 --> 17:33.208
Right this way. Tauverus.

17:41.984 --> 17:45.353
Where is this Byth Rok exactly?

17:45.421 --> 17:47.322
Heh.

17:47.390 --> 17:48.990
Stop him!

18:05.775 --> 18:08.276
Uhh! Uhh!

18:16.118 --> 18:18.553
Green Lanterns?
Destroy them!

18:27.463 --> 18:28.830
Grr!

18:28.898 --> 18:31.733
Pzzzt.

18:31.801 --> 18:32.968
Shut the door.

18:33.035 --> 18:34.369
[alarm sounds]

18:35.771 --> 18:37.305
Aah!

18:37.373 --> 18:39.307
Not much time,
but it may be enough.

18:39.375 --> 18:43.378
Byth, we're going to set you free.
All of you.

18:44.554 --> 18:46.381
[all cheering]

18:46.449 --> 18:51.219
But we need you to do something for us.
What we're facing is big.

18:51.287 --> 18:54.689
The entire universe is in danger
from the menace of the Red Lanterns.

18:54.757 --> 18:58.493
Byth, if you and your men join
our attack, we just might succeed.

19:00.290 --> 19:04.165
That was never part of the deal, but...

19:04.233 --> 19:07.669
you guys have shown me
the error of my ways.

19:07.737 --> 19:11.039
I'm traveling a high road from now on.

19:12.108 --> 19:15.477
Glad we could help.
Aim for the roof.

19:20.416 --> 19:23.979
Byth, lead your men straight
at the warship. Right now.

19:24.014 --> 19:25.487
Ahem.
One moment.

19:25.554 --> 19:32.127
Men, my every thought and effort has been
to free you from this horrible prison.

19:32.194 --> 19:34.896
Now we have a chance
to fight the Red Lanterns,

19:34.964 --> 19:37.299
attack their giant battle destroyer

19:37.366 --> 19:39.634
on the side of the
mighty Green Lanterns.

19:39.702 --> 19:43.271
Well, I say...
this isn't our war.

19:43.339 --> 19:46.708
We don't need to help them.
We should help ourselves

19:46.776 --> 19:48.977
by getting out of
here as fast as we can.

19:49.045 --> 19:51.346
So follow me to freedom!

19:51.414 --> 19:53.581
[all cheering]

19:56.152 --> 19:59.354
- Boy, that double crossing...
- Wait for it.

19:59.422 --> 20:01.956
So long, suckers.

20:03.292 --> 20:07.662
- You let him get away.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

20:18.607 --> 20:20.508
[growls]

20:26.849 --> 20:29.017
Back to the ship, now.

20:29.085 --> 20:32.053
<i>We have to get that code
or the entire invasion fails.</i>

20:36.558 --> 20:37.926
Grr!

20:50.773 --> 20:53.408
As soon as they're
out of range, we'll leave.

20:53.476 --> 20:54.709
I don't get it.

20:54.777 --> 20:56.244
We could never have won that fight.

20:56.312 --> 20:58.613
And Byth would only run
if it was his idea.

20:58.681 --> 21:03.218
You tricked him. Again.
I've underestimated your deviousness.

21:03.285 --> 21:08.289
Good work, Jordan. You got the
code and we got to keep the ring.

21:08.357 --> 21:10.792
That... that thief!

21:10.860 --> 21:14.129
Well, you did tell him he could have it
if he took it from you.

21:16.194 --> 21:19.401
Oh, such fine Oan craftsmanship.

21:26.952 --> 21:30.252
