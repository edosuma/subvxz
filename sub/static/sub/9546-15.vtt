Oh, thank you.
Good night.

Been a wonderful audience.
Drive safely.

02:31.111 --> 02:35.116
1:30. Guess these things
never happen on schedule.

02:35.116 --> 02:37.706
- I was up anyway.
- Julie sick?

02:37.706 --> 02:40.728
No, I was just waiting for a call.
Met a guy who works for united.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.765
He said he'd call me
when he lands.

02:42.765 --> 02:46.532
- Mmm, pilot.
- Co-pilot.

02:49.016 --> 02:52.836
- What?
- You know, second in command.

02:52.836 --> 02:56.910
No real responsibility.
Not quite the same thing, is it?

02:56.910 --> 02:59.474
Isn't that what you are?

03:07.445 --> 03:11.991
When? / About three hours ago.
Happened in the park across the street.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.877
She got away, ran for help.

03:14.877 --> 03:18.236
I don't know how she
made it this far.

03:18.236 --> 03:21.632
- Is that cognac?
- Yeah, we got that.

03:23.179 --> 03:27.617
She worked for a pharmaceutical
company. / That's right.

03:27.617 --> 03:32.240
She was in town for a convention.
Her name is Jean.

03:34.595 --> 03:37.118
Damn, you still amaze me
after all these years.

03:37.118 --> 03:40.016
How did you figure that out?

03:40.016 --> 03:42.558
- Name tag.
- Name tag.

03:42.558 --> 03:44.995
Sorry, excuse me,
excuse me. All right.

03:44.995 --> 03:48.167
Ooh, I have to go to the bathroom.
Here, in case you need some wipes.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.799
- You're going in there?
- That's the plan.

03:49.799 --> 03:51.585
Oh, I'd rather you didn't. / Why?

03:51.585 --> 03:54.555
Just I can't...
it's hard to explain, okay? Please.

03:54.555 --> 03:55.904
Okay, don't think about it.
I'll be right back.

03:55.904 --> 03:57.684
Natalie, please don't!

03:57.684 --> 03:59.091
- Captain...
- Yep.

03:59.091 --> 04:00.560
We just talked to the brother.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.547
He said she had a date tonight with
a doctor she met at the convention.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.578
- Did the brother get a name?
- Wouldn't that be nice? No luck.

04:06.578 --> 04:10.338
We checked the hotel,
900 doctors registered.

04:10.338 --> 04:13.715
- Well, we know he wears glasses.
- We figured those were hers.

04:13.715 --> 04:16.702
They're not hers.
She was wearing contacts.

04:18.053 --> 04:22.029
Well, that's a start. We're looking for
a doctor who's lost his spectacles.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.625
Get those downtown. Maybe we'll
get lucky with the prescription.

04:26.615 --> 04:28.573
Mr. Monk, answer the phone!

04:29.400 --> 04:32.361
What? / That's the phone!
Answer the phone!

04:35.817 --> 04:37.612
Mr. Monk, please!

04:47.089 --> 04:50.141
Hello? Hello?

04:50.141 --> 04:52.806
Here, here, here!

04:52.806 --> 04:54.478
Was it him?
Call him back.

04:54.478 --> 04:56.582
It's a private number!
Why didn't you answer it?

04:56.582 --> 04:58.932
- I couldn't. I, I don't know how.
- Mr. Monk, that was important to me.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.327
How could you not know
about cell phones?

05:00.327 --> 05:03.566
Everybody has a cell phone.
How do you function in the world?

05:03.566 --> 05:06.628
I don't. Did you wash your hands?

05:06.628 --> 05:08.145
There, it's him!
Answer it!

05:08.145 --> 05:09.563
- Stottlemeyer.
- Answer it!

05:09.563 --> 05:14.318
Yeah, we're all here on a job.
Now?

05:14.318 --> 05:17.552
Yes, sir.

05:17.552 --> 05:20.230
That's the deputy commissioner.
We're being redeployed.

05:20.230 --> 05:22.501
- They want you too, Monk.
- What's going on?

05:22.501 --> 05:24.615
I don't know,
but it must be big.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.714
Let forensics handle this.

05:31.239 --> 05:34.392
- Captain, Monk. Thank you for coming.
- You didn't give us much choice.

05:34.392 --> 05:36.648
It's a firestorm heading right this way.

05:36.648 --> 05:39.176
We have a body south of market.
Caucasian male.

05:39.176 --> 05:41.606
There was a note.
It looks like a serial killer.

05:41.606 --> 05:44.168
The mayor's on his way back from Hawaii.

05:44.168 --> 05:46.003
Okay, Randy, you know the drill.

05:46.003 --> 05:48.138
Let's get two dedicated
phone lines upstairs...

05:48.138 --> 05:51.178
Actually, Leland, you
won't be quarterbacking this one.

05:51.178 --> 05:55.240
What? / It wasn't my call.
The feds are all over it.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.877
- That was fast.
- The mayor called them in.

05:57.877 --> 06:01.418
Kelsey, I have been working
serial cases for 20 years,

06:01.418 --> 06:05.707
since I was in pajamas.
Since when do I need a babysitter?

06:05.707 --> 06:07.793
It wasn't my call.

06:18.671 --> 06:20.862
What is that?

06:21.841 --> 06:24.903
Mr. Monk, that is
the future of law enforcement.

06:35.669 --> 06:37.908
- Talk to me.
- Me?

06:37.908 --> 06:40.814
Well, we just got here.
We're sort of playing catch-up.

06:40.814 --> 06:43.584
- I don't really have any...
- What are you doing?

06:43.584 --> 06:45.798
- I assumed you were asking...
- I'm not talking to you.

06:45.798 --> 06:48.447
I'm talking to Washington.

06:49.237 --> 06:51.207
Has anything leaked to the press?

06:52.143 --> 06:55.676
Has anything leaked to the press?
Yes or no?

06:55.676 --> 06:58.660
I, I don't know.
Like I said, we just got here.

06:58.660 --> 07:02.263
Hold on.
Will somebody shut this man up?

07:02.263 --> 07:04.185
What is your problem?

07:04.185 --> 07:06.248
Was that for me?
About the problem?

07:06.248 --> 07:08.638
I, I can't tell.
If it's for me, just nod.

07:08.638 --> 07:11.384
- Nod if it's me.
- Billy, I'll call you back.

07:11.384 --> 07:15.342
Agent Thorpe, thank you for coming.
This is captain Leland Stottlemeyer,

07:15.342 --> 07:19.344
lieutenant Disher, Natalie Teeger,
and Adrian Monk.

07:19.344 --> 07:22.109
Who's Billy? / Well, there must
be two Adrian Monks.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.031
'cause the one I've been hearing
about is a world class detective.

07:25.031 --> 07:26.100
The best of the best.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.808
He's just never seen
an earpiece phone before.

07:28.808 --> 07:32.416
- Where's he been? In a coma?
- In a coma? No.

07:32.416 --> 07:33.933
I wish.

07:39.670 --> 07:41.967
Welcome to San Francisco.

07:41.967 --> 07:44.787
I guess you and I are
going to be working in tandem.

07:44.787 --> 07:46.405
I guess we are, captain.

07:46.405 --> 07:48.405
Let me tell you my
definition of tandem.

07:48.405 --> 07:51.120
I say something, you do it.

07:54.233 --> 07:58.916
Okay. Your show.
Where would you like to start?

07:58.916 --> 08:02.091
I'd like to start at the ME's office.
Take a look at the body.

08:02.091 --> 08:04.791
Fine, you can follow us.

08:04.791 --> 08:08.474
Actually, lieutenant,
I think you should follow us.

08:08.474 --> 08:11.224
Straight up mission street,
4.3 kilometers.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.105
Yeah, you don't want to go up mission.
This time of night, all red lights.

08:14.105 --> 08:15.445
Is it?

08:26.786 --> 08:29.819
- Wow, where'd you get that?
- I designed it.

08:29.819 --> 08:32.191
- Can I see it?
- No.

08:36.585 --> 08:39.236
- You see that?
- Uh-huh.

08:42.881 --> 08:46.819
Talk to me. / Male caucasian,
5'10", 165 pounds...

08:46.819 --> 08:49.937
I read the preliminary.
Tell me something I don't know.

08:49.937 --> 08:51.332
Where'd we find him?

08:51.332 --> 08:54.491
In a parking lot near a TV station.
Minimal blood on the scene.

08:54.491 --> 08:56.444
The body was probably moved postmortem.

08:56.444 --> 09:00.233
Mr. Monk?
What are you doing?

09:00.233 --> 09:02.619
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

09:02.619 --> 09:05.265
I don't always know.

09:05.265 --> 09:07.719
Sorry, we were working on
this case before.

09:07.719 --> 09:11.079
We got called away. / That is correct.
You were called away.

09:11.079 --> 09:13.998
Mr. Monk, we're not worried
about her. / We're not?

09:13.998 --> 09:16.559
Whoever that poor woman is,
she is a side show.

09:16.559 --> 09:19.333
- This is the primary right here.
- Here's the thing.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.655
I'll tell you the thing.
The thing is over here!

09:22.655 --> 09:26.403
That case doesn't exist.
I want you to forget about her.

09:26.403 --> 09:27.668
Cover her up.

09:28.316 --> 09:29.986
Cover her up.

09:31.239 --> 09:33.304
Cover her up!

09:33.304 --> 09:38.074
I want you over here.
Both of you, over here!

09:38.074 --> 09:39.508
Don't look back!

09:42.461 --> 09:48.020
Look, um...we can't help you
unless we know what's going on.

09:48.020 --> 09:52.306
Can I see the file?
Thank you.

09:52.306 --> 09:54.002
What's the cause of death?

09:55.159 --> 09:58.987
Uh, blunt force trauma to the
back of the cranium. / Oh, no.

09:58.987 --> 10:02.846
Plus a small puncture injected
with poison. / Oh, no!

10:02.846 --> 10:07.237
Plus signs of petechial hemorrhaging
and suffocation. / Oh, no!

10:07.237 --> 10:09.315
Plus two gunshot wounds,
four stab wounds,

10:09.315 --> 10:11.453
and a tire track across the upper torso.

10:11.453 --> 10:15.814
- So the cause of death was...
- Pretty much everything.

10:15.814 --> 10:18.743
- Why?
- That, Ms. Teeger, is the question.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.579
That's why I'm here.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.647
Well, we need to know
what happened and when.

10:22.647 --> 10:24.838
I suggest we start with
the ballistics and the tire tracks.

10:24.838 --> 10:26.996
Already done, captain.
Thank you.

10:26.996 --> 10:29.744
Get the stomach contents
and liver tissue to toxicology.

10:29.744 --> 10:31.234
I want to know what he ate
and where he ate it

10:31.234 --> 10:33.136
before it dissolves and
disappears forever.

10:33.136 --> 10:35.584
He played guitar.

10:35.584 --> 10:37.641
Calluses.

10:37.641 --> 10:41.059
According to the file, his pockets
were filled with coins and tokens.

10:41.059 --> 10:43.808
- He's probably a street musician.
- That should help ID him.

10:43.808 --> 10:46.914
We don't need any help ID'ing him.
I just got a hit on the fingerprints.

10:46.914 --> 10:50.774
His name is Cyrus Canning.
337 Folsom street.

10:50.774 --> 10:53.822
Good, I'll get a copy of
the driver's license.

10:56.367 --> 10:59.000
- Already done.
- How many MEs on staff?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.412
- 3, and 2 assistants.
- Wake them up.

11:01.412 --> 11:04.185
All leaves are canceled. I need
to know the exact cause of death

11:04.185 --> 11:06.303
and the exact order
these wounds were inflicted.

11:06.303 --> 11:08.236
Well, he's pretty banged up.
It might take a while.

11:08.236 --> 11:11.687
We don't have a while.
We have 36 hours, doctor.

11:11.687 --> 11:13.684
This was pinned to the body.

11:15.482 --> 11:19.863
"The cleansing has begun.
I will claim another victim in 36 hours."

11:19.863 --> 11:23.730
"1 P.M. Friday, then
every 36 hours after that."

11:23.730 --> 11:25.863
"Signed, the Six-Way killer."

11:25.863 --> 11:30.026
- The Six-Way killer.
- I'll take that.

11:36.889 --> 11:38.890
We have less than 30 hours
before he strikes again.

11:38.890 --> 11:42.341
Every second counts. That's
why I've divided the strike force.

11:42.341 --> 11:44.509
Stottlemeyer and his group are
at the secondary location

11:44.509 --> 11:47.738
- where the body was found.
- I can't find my seatbelt.

11:47.738 --> 11:49.643
Here, maybe it's under the seat.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.879
Mr. Monk, are you listening?

11:50.879 --> 11:53.649
Yeah, I'm with you.
30 hours to go, every second counts.

11:53.649 --> 11:55.287
That is correct.
I read your file.

11:55.287 --> 11:57.513
You appear to be a first-rate
crime scene analyst.

11:57.513 --> 12:00.461
- Those skills could come in handy.
- Here it is!

12:00.461 --> 12:03.064
Oh, no. False alarm.

12:03.064 --> 12:06.982
Mr. Monk, we're looking for the primary
location where the murder actually took place.

12:06.982 --> 12:10.349
The victim's clothes, covered with
DNA and microscopic trace evidence.

12:10.349 --> 12:14.273
- So we're going to a crime lab?
- Ms. Teeger, you're in a crime lab.

12:14.273 --> 12:16.991
This is the most advanced forensics
laboratory in North America.

12:16.991 --> 12:18.949
Gas chromatograph,
mass spectrometer,

12:18.949 --> 12:21.912
a continuous digital uplink
to FBI facilities in Quantico.

12:21.912 --> 12:23.518
That's great.
I can't find my seatbelt.

12:23.518 --> 12:26.242
You don't need a seatbelt.
This thing is built like a tank.

12:26.242 --> 12:29.800
Yeah, here's the thing.
I feel better if I'm strapped in.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.093
I could fall out and bump my head.
It's very dangerous.

12:33.093 --> 12:35.412
I have a seatbelt.
All right, let's switch.

12:41.255 --> 12:44.130
- Aren't you worried about her?
- No, she's fine.

12:44.130 --> 12:49.320
Is there a shoulder strap?
I'm used to dual restraint. It's just...

12:55.191 --> 12:57.673
Can I get a light wave output? / Copy.

13:02.405 --> 13:04.681
I just don't get it.

13:04.681 --> 13:07.195
Why 36 hours?
What kind of deadline is that?

13:07.195 --> 13:11.195
Why not one day?
Or one week?

13:11.195 --> 13:13.462
And why six ways?
It doesn't make any sense.

13:13.462 --> 13:15.734
- Well, he's crazy.
- We think it's from the Bible.

13:15.734 --> 13:19.032
Three 6s, it's the number
of the beast. / No, no, no, no.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.470
Something's wrong here.
I think we should slow down,

13:22.470 --> 13:25.742
take a step back,
look at the big picture.

13:25.742 --> 13:30.088
I don't care about the big picture.
God is in the details, Mr. Monk.

13:30.088 --> 13:33.578
It's all right in front of us, right here,
if you know where to look.

13:33.578 --> 13:37.312
Bingo! I have an animal hair.
Mammalian. It's from a ferret.

13:37.312 --> 13:40.341
A ferret? / The jacket contains
perchloroethylene.

13:40.341 --> 13:43.976
- It's a chemical used in dry cleaning.
- Ferret hairs and a dry cleaner.

13:43.976 --> 13:46.972
These are all the pet stores
in the bay area that sell ferrets.

13:46.972 --> 13:50.402
We'll cross-check them against dry
cleaners that use perchloroethylene.

13:50.402 --> 13:53.854
Bingo! A shopping plaza,
corner of Powell and Sutter.

13:53.854 --> 13:57.464
Welcome to the 21st century, Mr. Monk.

13:57.464 --> 14:01.158
What are you doing? / I'm just
borrowing your blackboard here.

14:01.158 --> 14:05.237
- It helps me think.
- That's a TV monitor!

14:05.237 --> 14:08.522
So it's a combination?
TV/blackboard?

14:08.522 --> 14:11.379
- No, it's not!
- It is now.

14:13.424 --> 14:16.850
What is your problem? Haven't you ever
seen a plasma screen television before?

14:16.850 --> 14:19.638
What are you doing!
That's hydrofluoric acid.

14:19.638 --> 14:22.446
That's for identifying firearms.

14:35.401 --> 14:37.561
I'm worried about mom
going shopping alone.

14:37.561 --> 14:39.784
- What do you mean?
- You know, the crazy guy.

14:39.784 --> 14:41.969
The Six-Way killer.

14:41.969 --> 14:47.467
- Everybody's talking about it online.
- Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.598
How come you're not working on it?

14:49.598 --> 14:53.358
This FBI agent in charge,
he won't even talk to me.

14:53.358 --> 14:56.392
He thinks I'm an antique.

14:56.392 --> 14:58.743
He's not wrong.

14:58.743 --> 15:04.030
- I think you're a genius.
- What are you doing?

15:04.030 --> 15:08.151
Talking to my friends. Talking to
5 different people at once.

15:08.151 --> 15:09.457
Really?

15:11.123 --> 15:12.618
This is my friend Carly.

15:12.618 --> 15:17.146
She wants to know if I'm
going to Kayla's slumber party.

15:17.146 --> 15:22.008
Julie, do you think you
could teach me?

15:22.008 --> 15:26.302
- Teach you what?
- That computer...

15:26.302 --> 15:28.451
Oh, yeah, sure. It's easy.

15:30.978 --> 15:33.916
Okay, so...
this is called a mouse.

15:33.916 --> 15:37.615
Oh, God. I know that.
I haven't been living in a cave.

15:37.615 --> 15:44.132
- And this is a mouse pad.
- Wow, that is so rubbery.

15:44.132 --> 15:45.782
It's outstanding.

15:45.782 --> 15:50.879
So you slide the mouse around like this.
And you see that little arrow right there?

15:50.879 --> 15:54.834
That is called a cursor.
And it's kind of like a little pointer.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.291
You want to try it?

15:57.700 --> 16:00.122
You think I'm ready?

16:20.569 --> 16:25.390
Mr. Monk, you can go faster.
It's not like it's a ouija board.

16:25.390 --> 16:28.290
Let's say you want to
play extreme GoCarts.

16:28.290 --> 16:33.822
What you gotta do is put the cursor
in that little empty box right there.

16:42.670 --> 16:45.012
Now click it.

16:48.927 --> 16:52.019
Hey!
Hey, there we go!

16:52.019 --> 16:54.921
I did it. / Yeah. / I did it.

16:54.921 --> 16:59.756
Thanks a lot, Julie.
I feel so relieved.

16:59.756 --> 17:03.818
Uh, Mr. Monk, you better come back here.
There's a lot more to learn.

17:03.818 --> 17:05.203
Is there?

17:07.605 --> 17:12.652
- Let's set you up an email account.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:12.652 --> 17:14.444
It's so that your friend...

17:14.444 --> 17:17.928
um, so my mom can send you messages.

17:17.928 --> 17:21.262
Okay, you need a screen name.

17:21.262 --> 17:25.540
- Mr...
- Monk.

17:25.540 --> 17:30.015
And now you need your
secret password. / Yeah.

17:32.617 --> 17:34.679
"Trudy."

17:34.679 --> 17:36.933
Well, you know, everybody
will probably guess that.

17:36.933 --> 17:39.063
Let's think of something else.

17:52.661 --> 17:55.547
Okay, let's do "Trudy."

17:58.136 --> 18:00.065
There you go. You're online.

18:00.065 --> 18:04.400
Oh... Oh...

18:09.177 --> 18:14.766
I'm on the web.
The world wide web.

18:14.766 --> 18:18.042
Welcome to 1998, Mr. Monk.

20:00.309 --> 20:04.216
- Hello?
- Natalie! Natalie, it's me, Adrian Monk.

20:04.216 --> 20:06.357
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:06.357 --> 20:09.364
I'm great, Natalie.

20:09.364 --> 20:14.579
Guess what I did.
I was playing solitaire.

20:14.579 --> 20:18.611
And I won.
And the cards are dancing!

20:18.611 --> 20:22.607
I think they're dancing!
How soon can you get here?

20:22.607 --> 20:28.154
- Mr. Monk, what time is it?
- The time is, uh...

20:28.154 --> 20:33.876
oh, yeah, okay, hold on, I got this.
Hold on. I know this, I know this.

20:33.876 --> 20:35.654
Hold, please.

20:40.078 --> 20:45.233
Yeah, it is exactly 2:55 A.M.
and 44 seconds Pacific time,

20:45.233 --> 20:53.133
and 1:55 P.M. in Moscow,
and in Singapore, it, hello?

20:53.133 --> 20:55.027
Natalie?

21:33.537 --> 21:35.833
Sweet.

21:40.355 --> 21:42.388
Keep your eye on the clock, people!

21:42.388 --> 21:45.867
We have three hours
before he strikes again.

21:45.867 --> 21:49.402
Last night, the suspect called
a local radio station.

21:49.402 --> 21:51.647
- You have the transcript in front of you.
- If he reaches out again,

21:51.647 --> 21:55.126
the call's going to be forwarded here
and we're going to try to trace it.

21:55.126 --> 21:58.170
The Six-Way killer parked
his car in this alley.

21:58.170 --> 22:01.691
We found traces of fresh paint on the wall.

22:01.691 --> 22:05.336
It belonged to a 2006 silver Chevy Impala.

22:05.336 --> 22:07.470
The paint contained traces
of a polymer soap

22:07.470 --> 22:09.390
which is commonly used in car washes.

22:09.390 --> 22:12.328
We located a car wash on Geary street,

22:12.328 --> 22:15.072
where an employee named Raoul Calaro

22:15.072 --> 22:18.729
remembered seeing the suspect's car.

22:18.729 --> 22:21.947
Mr. Monk, what are
you doing? / I'm, uh...

22:21.947 --> 22:26.865
I'm, I'm just booting up.
That means "start."

22:26.865 --> 22:31.514
- Yes, I know.
- It's a Dell, so fully-loaded.

22:31.514 --> 22:33.705
I'm sure it is.

22:35.001 --> 22:36.436
Under persistent questioning,

22:36.436 --> 22:39.394
Mr. Calaro admitted that he stole
some items from the Chevy,

22:39.394 --> 22:41.549
$4 in change and some liquor.

22:41.549 --> 22:43.921
Unfortunately, he doesn't
remember the driver.

22:43.921 --> 22:45.959
There was a security camera
at the car wash.

22:45.959 --> 22:49.117
We captured a partial image
of the license plate.

22:49.117 --> 22:51.484
Hey!

22:51.484 --> 22:54.912
Sorry, I got, I got mail.

22:57.690 --> 23:01.109
- Bigger what, guaranteed?
- May I continue?

23:01.109 --> 23:04.315
Yeah, you can talk as much as
you want. I got tons of memory.

23:04.315 --> 23:08.332
It's called bits.
Memory, or bits of memory.

23:08.332 --> 23:11.064
It's all, it's all the same.

23:12.641 --> 23:16.831
The first digit is obviously a 5.
The second letter is either an F or a P.

23:16.831 --> 23:22.080
Wait! Wait, uh...
wait, wait, saving, saving...

23:22.080 --> 23:23.849
I think I liked you better
when you were a dinosaur.

23:23.849 --> 23:32.035
I heard that. That's funny. That's
enough to make me LOL. Out loud.

23:32.035 --> 23:38.295
That's him! / Keep him talking.
We need 25 seconds.

23:38.295 --> 23:41.992
- Hello?
- Who is this?

23:41.992 --> 23:47.321
My name is captain Leland
Stottlemeyer. Who's this?

23:47.321 --> 23:48.837
I assume you're a cop.

23:48.837 --> 23:54.405
That's right, I'm a captain with
the San Francisco police department,
homicide division.

23:54.405 --> 23:56.362
And may I ask who I'm talking to?

23:56.362 --> 24:01.063
This is Six-Way, your new best friend.
Are you wearing a watch, captain?

24:01.063 --> 24:04.110
Um, oh, yes, I am.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.895
Then you know you have 3 hours left.
The beast must be fed.

24:07.895 --> 24:11.647
The beast?

24:11.647 --> 24:13.246
Why are you doing this?

24:13.246 --> 24:19.637
You could figure that out for yourself,
Leland, if you were smart enough.

24:19.637 --> 24:24.619
You know, I am just smart enough,
beast, to know that sometimes...

24:24.619 --> 24:27.399
I need the help of friends.

24:27.399 --> 24:30.416
Relax, Leland.

24:30.416 --> 24:35.167
We've got a long drive ahead of us.
See you around.

24:39.506 --> 24:41.284
We got him.
He's in the Richmond district!

24:41.284 --> 24:43.693
5.2 kilometers,
we're there in 10 minutes.

24:43.693 --> 24:46.974
Have the SWAT team meet us there.
We're going in hard and heavy!

24:46.974 --> 24:52.310
Saving...saving...
saving, powering down.

25:16.923 --> 25:19.856
FBI! FBI!
Everybody down! Everybody down!

25:19.856 --> 25:21.250
Let me see your hands!

25:35.539 --> 25:38.323
- What the hell happened here?
- I don't know.

25:38.323 --> 25:40.512
Mr. Monk, come on.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.235
You. How old are you?

25:46.235 --> 25:48.091
- Are you a child or a man?
- Thorpe, hang on.

25:48.091 --> 25:51.676
It's my call, captain!

25:51.676 --> 25:56.543
We are men trying to do a job.
There's a killer out there.

25:56.543 --> 26:02.107
If you can't help, it's your
responsibility to step aside.

26:02.107 --> 26:04.599
I'm sending you home.

26:04.599 --> 26:06.760
- Go home now.
- Here's the...

26:06.760 --> 26:11.047
Don't talk!
We're not talking.

26:11.047 --> 26:14.313
You don't belong here.
Turn around.

26:14.313 --> 26:19.673
Do it!
Now walk away.

26:19.673 --> 26:23.214
That's right, walk away.
Keep walking.

26:23.214 --> 26:25.278
Don't look back!

26:28.245 --> 26:30.470
Good-bye, Mr. Monk.

26:54.466 --> 26:56.673
You know it's all over the news, right?

26:56.673 --> 27:00.451
The 1 o'clock deadline,
the Six-Way killer...

27:00.451 --> 27:02.900
- It's really frightening.
- I think there's more to it.

27:02.900 --> 27:07.653
I'm not sure this guy
is a real serial killer.

27:10.113 --> 27:12.016
I guess it doesn't matter what I think.

27:12.016 --> 27:16.504
- Why, you're no longer on the case?
- Not just the case.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.725
I'll probably never get back on the force.

27:18.725 --> 27:22.832
The agent in charge made sure of that.

27:24.148 --> 27:26.155
He said there's no room

27:26.155 --> 27:30.803
for a dinosaur like me
in modern law enforcement.

27:30.803 --> 27:33.416
Well, I'm sorry.

27:33.416 --> 27:36.968
I don't know how it happened.

27:36.968 --> 27:44.392
At some point, I just got stuck.
The world kept turning and changing.

27:44.392 --> 27:51.768
Microchips, cell phones,
TV screen blackboards...

27:51.768 --> 27:56.247
And I didn't.
I didn't change.

27:56.247 --> 27:58.391
You know, Adrian,

27:58.391 --> 28:02.414
I think that this is your way
of keeping your mind clear.

28:02.414 --> 28:06.123
No, no, no, no. So that you can
focus on what's really important.

28:06.123 --> 28:10.948
Adrian, let's not forget you've put a lot
of very dangerous people behind bars

28:10.948 --> 28:13.989
without the use of a computer.

28:13.989 --> 28:16.567
Your mind is amazing.
No, no, really.

28:16.567 --> 28:19.341
You make connections
and leaps intuitively.

28:19.341 --> 28:21.578
No machine could ever do that.

28:21.578 --> 28:25.396
You know, maybe a computer
would just slow you down.

28:29.288 --> 28:32.679
- Maybe you're right.
- Yes. Yeah, you know...

28:32.679 --> 28:35.709
you're like John Henry,
man vs. the machine.

28:35.709 --> 28:38.153
You know that song? / No.

28:40.164 --> 28:45.328
I was, um... I was in a folk
singing group in college.

28:45.328 --> 28:48.204
We always used to end each show
singing that song.

28:48.204 --> 28:52.563
- You never heard it?
- Uh, no. Uh-uh.

28:52.563 --> 28:56.704
¢Ü When John Henry was a little baby
he sat on his momma's knee ¢Ü

28:56.704 --> 29:00.256
¢Ü he picked up a hammer, a piece of steel
said hammer will be the death of me ¢Ü

29:00.256 --> 29:03.705
¢Ü Lord, lord ¢Ü

29:03.705 --> 29:07.319
¢Ü hammer will be the death of me, yes! ¢Ü

29:10.987 --> 29:15.449
Well...
Okay, okay then. Thank you.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.929
Adrian, the point is
that he was a steel driver.

29:17.929 --> 29:23.405
There was a big contest between John Henry
and the big, new, modern steam drill,

29:23.405 --> 29:26.370
and John Henry won.

29:26.370 --> 29:27.976
- He, he did?
- He won, yes.

29:27.976 --> 29:30.196
I mean, absolutely.
That's why I'm telling you this.

29:30.196 --> 29:32.406
Oh...
yeah.

29:32.406 --> 29:37.035
He won, he was a hero.
Everybody loved him.

29:37.035 --> 29:40.345
God, I just loved it when everybody
joined in on that last verse.

29:40.345 --> 29:41.836
Really?

29:42.963 --> 29:47.404
¢Ü When John Henry was hammering that
mountain mountain was spitting fire ¢Ü

29:47.404 --> 29:49.407
¢Ü he worked so hard
that he broke his heart ¢Ü

29:49.407 --> 29:50.823
¢Ü laid down his hammer and he died ¢Ü

29:50.823 --> 29:54.445
¢Ü lord, lord ¢Ü

29:54.445 --> 29:58.814
¢Ü he laid down his hammer ¢Ü

29:58.814 --> 30:02.954
¢Ü and he died ¢Ü

30:06.727 --> 30:09.961
So he...
he died?

30:09.961 --> 30:12.885
Oh.

30:12.885 --> 30:14.918
Yeah, I guess he did.

30:14.918 --> 30:18.466
No, no, no, in this version. You know,
there were a lot of versions.

30:18.466 --> 30:21.121
- I think our time is up.
- No, no, no, it's not, Adrian.

30:21.121 --> 30:23.288
- Yeah, I think our time is up.
- No, it's only 20 after.

30:23.288 --> 30:26.353
Adrian, no, really. Ad, Adri...

30:27.315 --> 30:30.550
This body's pretty badly mutilated.
We're gonna need a little more time.

30:30.550 --> 30:33.959
We don't have any more time, doctor.
What the hell have you been doing?

30:33.959 --> 30:36.281
We've been working 24/7
on this case like you told us.

30:36.281 --> 30:39.040
Okay, all right.
Here's my best guess.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.210
The victim was hit first,
but the blow didn't kill him.

30:42.210 --> 30:44.548
Cause of death was probably suffocation.

30:44.548 --> 30:46.680
The other injuries were inflicted postmortem.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.194
Keep going, keep working.
Call me back when you're sure.

30:50.194 --> 30:51.557
Cause of death, suffocation.

30:51.557 --> 30:54.920
Let's add that to the psychological profile.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.161
You're wrong about Adrian Monk.

30:57.161 --> 30:58.983
- Am I?
- Yep.

30:58.983 --> 31:03.552
I know he's a little strange
and he can be difficult but,

31:03.552 --> 31:07.170
I can tell you of at least 12 different cases
where all of the evidence...

31:07.170 --> 31:09.122
Captain Stottlemeyer...

31:09.122 --> 31:12.546
you're looking at $1/2
billion worth of equipment.

31:12.546 --> 31:17.316
Are you trying to tell me that your funny
little friend is smarter than all of this?

31:18.709 --> 31:20.814
Yes, I am.

31:23.529 --> 31:27.855
Is that a radar detector? / No.

31:27.855 --> 31:29.360
You wouldn't tell me
if it was, would you?

31:29.360 --> 31:31.992
It's not a radar detector.

31:33.157 --> 31:34.767
Right.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.297
Here's an updated profile.

31:36.297 --> 31:38.575
Suffocation indicates
the assault was personal,

31:38.575 --> 31:40.852
motivated by repressed anger.

31:40.852 --> 31:43.560
Choice of street performer
as victim may be significant.

31:43.560 --> 31:47.561
The suspect's father
was probably a failed musician.

31:47.561 --> 31:50.075
- So he hates street musicians.
- Who doesn't?

31:50.075 --> 31:51.755
We can nail this bastard.
Sweep the city.

31:51.755 --> 31:55.911
I want all musicians off the street,
except one.

32:03.435 --> 32:05.318
5, 6, 7, 8...

32:05.318 --> 32:09.431
¢Ü Well, I'm tired of sucking up
and working for the man ¢Ü

32:09.431 --> 32:11.974
- ¢Ü keep the people down ¢Ü
- Bravo one, good to go.

32:11.974 --> 32:13.730
Bravo two, locked and loaded.

32:13.730 --> 32:17.226
¢Ü Cuff my brothers and sisters
oh, that's not the way to be ¢Ü

32:17.226 --> 32:24.537
¢Ü 'cause, baby, those days are gone
the music set me free ¢Ü

32:24.537 --> 32:27.881
¢Ü I don't need a captain
to make me feel strong ¢Ü

32:27.881 --> 32:31.814
- There's a flaw in your plan.
- What's that?

32:31.814 --> 32:38.803
Well, the first person that attacks him
might not necessarily be your serial killer.

32:38.803 --> 32:43.436
- It would be me.
- 27 minutes.

32:44.874 --> 32:46.173
Well, that was the captain.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.092
They're all at the Sheridan square
trying to stake it out.

32:49.092 --> 32:52.126
- Want to go check it out?
- Nah, I'd just be in the way.

32:52.126 --> 32:54.450
Here's where I belong. In there.

32:54.450 --> 32:57.687
Why don't you call Dr. Walsh?
Tell him to meet me here.

32:57.687 --> 33:01.261
He can stuff me and put me on
display with all the other relics.

33:01.261 --> 33:04.445
Come on, Mr. Monk. You know the
medical examiner's a little busy today.

33:04.445 --> 33:07.282
Everybody's working on the big case.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.757
What?

33:10.757 --> 33:13.275
- What did you say?
- I said they're too busy.

33:13.275 --> 33:16.935
They're all working on
the Six-Way killer thing.

33:16.935 --> 33:19.466
That's right.

33:19.466 --> 33:21.795
Natalie, you're right!

33:21.795 --> 33:26.816
That's the key!
Everybody is too busy.

33:26.816 --> 33:29.241
- What time is it?
- It's 12:45.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.095
15 minutes, we gotta hurry.
Come on!

33:31.095 --> 33:33.911
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you in the car. Let's go!

33:37.942 --> 33:41.556
¢Ü I don't need a captain
to make me feel strong ¢Ü

33:41.556 --> 33:45.305
¢Ü I don't need a badge
to tell me wrong from right ¢Ü

33:45.305 --> 33:49.483
¢Ü I don't need a badge
to tell me day from night ¢Ü

33:49.483 --> 33:54.939
¢Ü I don't need nobody
'cause, baby, I am free ¢Ü

33:56.114 --> 34:00.026
This is a complete waste of time.
You know that, don't you?

34:00.026 --> 34:01.977
Did you say something?

34:01.977 --> 34:08.683
Yeah, yeah. I said, uh,
I think Monk's right, sir.

34:08.683 --> 34:12.520
I've never read one of these
psychological profiles that meant squat.

34:12.520 --> 34:16.364
Particularly if it was compiled
by one of these gizmos.

34:16.364 --> 34:20.121
These gizmos, as you call them,
are gonna catch our killer.

34:20.121 --> 34:23.422
- Mark my words.
- Southeast corner.

34:23.422 --> 34:26.690
¢Ü Cleaning up the streets, God bless.
Poppa's got a new gig, ¢Ü

34:26.690 --> 34:27.853
¢Ü he's got a brand new... ¢Ü

34:27.853 --> 34:30.706
Male caucasian, green jacket.
He fits the profile!

34:30.706 --> 34:32.992
Everybody stay frosty!

34:34.902 --> 34:38.585
¢Ü and music set me free ¢Ü

34:38.585 --> 34:42.406
¢Ü I don't need a badge
to tell me wrong from right ¢Ü

34:42.406 --> 34:46.277
¢Ü I don't need a badge
'cause my eyes can see ¢Ü

34:46.277 --> 34:49.103
¢Ü I don't need a badge
'cause, baby, I am free ¢Ü

34:49.103 --> 34:51.447
- This guy looks like approaching.
- Moving in.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.597
¢Ü I don't need a badge ¢Ü

34:57.597 --> 35:01.191
Move, move. Down on the ground!
Get down!

35:01.191 --> 35:04.633
FBI! Stay down!
Let me see your hands!

35:04.633 --> 35:08.451
Easy, easy.
Stand down.

35:12.883 --> 35:16.759
Harmonica. / I was just
gonna play with him.

35:16.759 --> 35:18.007
Yeah.

35:28.512 --> 35:31.050
You hurt?

35:31.050 --> 35:34.797
- Just your pride, right?
- What do you mean?

35:34.797 --> 35:38.212
Never mind. / It's a message
from your friend Natalie Teeger.

35:38.212 --> 35:42.370
She said,
"Monk just solved the case."

35:51.075 --> 35:52.609
You got, like, 5 bucks in there.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.322
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:56.602 --> 35:59.277
What the hell's going on?
Who told you to stop?

35:59.277 --> 36:01.674
I did. / What are you doing?

36:01.674 --> 36:03.488
I told you before.
She doesn't matter.

36:03.488 --> 36:06.315
Actually, agent Thorpe,
she not only matters,

36:06.315 --> 36:08.608
she is the key to this whole case.

36:08.608 --> 36:11.958
Your so-called Six-Way killer
killed her first.

36:11.958 --> 36:14.654
The other kid, the street musician,
was just a diversion.

36:14.654 --> 36:18.829
It's true.
Captain, the same guy killed both.

36:19.804 --> 36:22.109
You found a liquor bottle
in the killer's car.

36:22.109 --> 36:26.238
Remember, there was a cognac stain
on her sleeve.

36:26.238 --> 36:31.247
Monk.
Do you know who did it?

36:31.247 --> 36:33.331
She'll tell us if it's not too late.

36:33.331 --> 36:35.368
We've already wasted a day and a half.

36:35.368 --> 36:40.483
It was the deadline, 36 hours.
It seemed so arbitrary, didn't it?

36:40.483 --> 36:45.218
I mean, when you really stopped
and thought about it...

36:45.218 --> 36:48.966
Then Natalie reminded me
how hard everybody was working

36:48.966 --> 36:51.888
on the Six-Way killer case.
And I wondered,

36:51.888 --> 36:56.624
"who would benefit from that?"
And there's only one answer.

36:56.624 --> 37:00.367
The man who killed this woman.

37:00.367 --> 37:05.137
Here's what happened. Ms. Garnett
met a doctor at the convention.

37:05.137 --> 37:08.341
He took her out to dinner.

37:08.341 --> 37:12.644
I don't know what they ordered,
but it must've been pretty special.

37:12.644 --> 37:14.844
- Why do you say that?
- Bcause whatever it was,

37:14.844 --> 37:17.652
it could've been traced
back to that restaurant.

37:17.652 --> 37:23.022
That meal, what they ate, that's
what this whole case has been about.

37:23.022 --> 37:25.345
He must've paid for it with a credit card.

37:25.345 --> 37:28.663
Something that we could trace later.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.058
Just listen.

37:31.058 --> 37:35.753
They ended up at Mt. Davidson park.
Something went wrong.

37:35.753 --> 37:39.187
We'll never know exactly what happened.
All we know is that she got away.

37:39.187 --> 37:42.459
She ran across the street
to the gas station.

37:42.459 --> 37:45.466
But now the killer had a problem.
He was a doctor.

37:45.466 --> 37:48.881
So he knew there'd be an autopsy
and that we'd be able to trace

37:48.881 --> 37:50.874
whatever she had for dinner.

37:50.874 --> 37:55.666
But he also knew
that if he could stall us, distract us,

37:55.666 --> 38:00.145
eventually the food
in her stomach would be digested.

38:00.145 --> 38:03.985
And the evidence would
be gone. / 36 hours.

38:03.985 --> 38:07.817
Exactly. Everything's gone in
a day and a half, even after death.

38:07.817 --> 38:09.187
So he distracted us.

38:09.187 --> 38:12.182
He picked a victim at random,
a street performer.

38:12.182 --> 38:14.495
And he killed him
in a particularly gruesome way.

38:14.495 --> 38:17.008
Six particularly gruesome ways, actually.

38:17.008 --> 38:20.101
He wrote a note,
he called us, he taunted us.

38:20.101 --> 38:25.594
Anything to keep our attention
off of her. / Here it is.

38:32.100 --> 38:36.993
What the hell is that?
These shiny little flecks.

38:36.993 --> 38:39.735
- Are those flower petals?
- I don't know.

38:46.111 --> 38:48.135
- It's a gold leaf cake!
- What?

38:48.135 --> 38:50.249
They use real rose petals
and flecks of gold.

38:50.249 --> 38:52.895
I had it once at this restaurant
called Justine's.

38:52.895 --> 38:55.862
They call it the world's
most romantic dessert.

38:55.862 --> 38:58.379
Looked better on the plate.

39:02.176 --> 39:06.152
1 o'clock.
It's the deadline.

39:10.639 --> 39:14.000
Help me turn this damn thing off.

39:46.035 --> 39:49.000
Dr. Leven?
These belong to you?

40:00.712 --> 40:04.935
Hey, you were right.
One of your gizmos caught the killer.

40:10.135 --> 40:15.561
- Nice shot.
- Yeah, I nailed him.

40:21.222 --> 40:23.892
Here.
"Dear Kimberly,"

40:23.892 --> 40:27.582
"I am sorry that I inadvertently sent
the SWAT team to Kayla's slumber party"

40:27.582 --> 40:30.164
"and made you cry.
I'm sorry about the nightmares."

40:30.164 --> 40:33.471
"It will never happen again.
Adrian Monk."

40:33.471 --> 40:36.585
Very good.
This next one is for Allison.

40:36.585 --> 40:37.984
"Dear Allison"

40:37.984 --> 40:40.737
Mr. Monk, that's gonna take you forever.
Why don't you just borrow my...

40:40.737 --> 40:43.276
No, thank you.
I'm fine.
