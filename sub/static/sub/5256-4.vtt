Hi, my name is crissle,

01:58.352 --> 02:00.185
And today we're gonna talk

02:00.187 --> 02:03.822
About the civil war spy
harriet tubman.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.593
<i>So harriet tubman does not</i>
<i>get her just due.</i>

02:07.595 --> 02:09.394
<i>Like, you hear her name,</i>
<i>and you think,</i>

02:09.396 --> 02:10.395
<i>She led the slaves</i>
<i>to freedom.</i>

02:10.397 --> 02:13.398
<i>But you most certainly</i>
<i>do not know</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.734
That she was a spy
for the union.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.837
<i>So the thing was,</i>
<i>when the civil war started,</i>

02:18.839 --> 02:21.340
<i>Harriet tubman was like,</i>
<i>wait a minute.</i>

02:21.342 --> 02:22.274
<i>I can do way more.</i>

02:22.276 --> 02:24.943
<i>So she went down there</i>
<i>to port royal,</i>

02:24.945 --> 02:26.411
<i>Which is in south carolina,</i>

02:26.413 --> 02:28.714
<i>And the union had, like,</i>
<i>taken it over.</i>

02:28.716 --> 02:29.882
<i>But it was still com--</i>

02:29.884 --> 02:30.749
<i>It was still, like--</i>

02:30.751 --> 02:33.318
<i>Like, not smothered</i>
<i>and covered.</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:35.354
That's [bleep]
like biscuits.

02:35.356 --> 02:39.491
It was--it was surrounded
by confederacy,

02:39.493 --> 02:40.526
<i>Like, places and [bleep].</i>

02:40.528 --> 02:43.395
<i>And at first, she's just</i>
<i>like a regular-ass person.</i>

02:43.397 --> 02:44.029
<i>She was a nurse.</i>

02:44.031 --> 02:45.531
<i>And that's when she was like,</i>

02:45.533 --> 02:46.632
<i>I know can do better</i>
<i>than this.</i>

02:46.634 --> 02:48.534
<i>Like, I know can free</i>
<i>way more slaves</i>

02:48.536 --> 02:49.968
<i>Than what you guys</i>
<i>are doing right now.</i>

02:49.970 --> 02:52.404
<i>And that's when she went</i>
<i>to the colonel and was like,</i>

02:52.406 --> 02:54.373
<i>I could totally be</i>
<i>a spy for you.</i>

02:54.375 --> 02:58.510
<i>I have connects, and, like,</i>

02:58.512 --> 02:59.411
<i>When I dress up and [bleep],</i>

02:59.413 --> 03:01.513
<i>Those people</i>
<i>have no idea who I am.</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:02.447
<i>And the colonel was like...</i>

03:02.449 --> 03:04.650
<i>[belches]</i>
<i>excuse me.</i>

03:04.652 --> 03:06.318
I got, like,
a good 15 minutes left in me

03:06.320 --> 03:07.419
Before the liquor takes over,

03:07.421 --> 03:11.657
And god only knows
what I'll say.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.991
- That's great.

03:12.993 --> 03:13.659
- [laughs]

03:13.661 --> 03:17.262
<i>And so then</i>
<i>the colonel was like, yeah,</i>

03:17.264 --> 03:19.531
<i>Obviously my white ass</i>
<i>can't go down there.</i>

03:19.533 --> 03:20.666
<i>Absolutely, you can be a spy.</i>

03:20.668 --> 03:21.900
<i>You down there,</i>
<i>do what the [bleep] you do.</i>

03:21.902 --> 03:26.738
<i>So she's like, okay, let me</i>
<i>put on my field hand clothes.</i>

03:26.740 --> 03:27.806
<i>And she was, like,</i>
<i>five feet tall,</i>

03:27.808 --> 03:29.741
<i>So it was very easy</i>
<i>for her to, like,</i>

03:29.743 --> 03:30.676
<i>Blend into the background.</i>

03:30.678 --> 03:33.412
And she is able to, like,
go to the plantations,

03:33.414 --> 03:35.914
<i>And she was like,</i>
<i>hey, guys, like,</i>

03:35.916 --> 03:37.916
<i>Not to stir up any [bleep]</i>
<i>or whatever,</i>

03:37.918 --> 03:40.619
<i>But, like, I know y'all</i>
<i>are tired of being slaves.</i>

03:40.621 --> 03:41.753
<i>I was totally tired</i>
<i>of being a slave.</i>

03:41.755 --> 03:45.357
<i>And none of us have to be</i>
<i>slaves anymore, so, like,</i>

03:45.359 --> 03:48.660
<i>Whoever's down to help</i>
<i>the union, just let me know.</i>

03:48.662 --> 03:50.696
<i>So everybody was like,</i>
<i>cool.</i>

03:50.698 --> 03:51.697
<i>And then she would go out--</i>

03:51.699 --> 03:53.465
<i>She had these friends</i>
<i>who were mariners,</i>

03:53.467 --> 03:58.303
Which are basically just, like,
people who work in the water--

03:58.305 --> 03:59.071
Like, with water [bleep].

03:59.073 --> 04:00.806
<i>And she's like, I know</i>
<i>there are mines out here,</i>

04:00.808 --> 04:04.009
<i>So let's work together and</i>
<i>find out where this [bleep] is,</i>

04:04.011 --> 04:04.910
<i>Because I'm a spy,</i>

04:04.912 --> 04:06.378
<i>And I'm gonna</i>
<i>get this [bleep].</i>

04:06.380 --> 04:07.546
<i>Like, I'm gonna burn</i>
<i>this [bleep] down.</i>

04:07.548 --> 04:10.382
And so then she went back to
the colonel, and she was like,

04:10.384 --> 04:14.586
<i>I have this idea to burn up</i>
<i>all the plantations.</i>

04:14.588 --> 04:15.454
<i>Here's all my research,</i>

04:15.456 --> 04:16.622
<i>And you should just</i>
<i>let me do it.</i>

04:16.624 --> 04:17.923
<i>And the colonel was like,</i>
<i>well, [bleep] it.</i>

04:17.925 --> 04:19.491
<i>Like, I don't have</i>
<i>[bleep] to lose.</i>

04:19.493 --> 04:21.893
<i>Like, let's work together</i>
<i>and burn that [bleep] down.</i>

04:21.895 --> 04:23.829
<i>And so they got together,</i>
<i>and she was like,</i>

04:23.831 --> 04:25.397
<i>Listen, this is about to be--</i>

04:25.399 --> 04:26.732
<i>Like, I'm not even</i>
<i>about to [bleep] you.</i>

04:26.734 --> 04:27.866
<i>This is about to be</i>
<i>some [bleep].</i>

04:27.868 --> 04:29.468
<i>Like, this is about to be,</i>
<i>like, a real stealth operation.</i>

04:29.470 --> 04:32.871
<i>You [bleep] have never seen</i>
<i>no [bleep] like this before.</i>

04:32.873 --> 04:36.675
<i>Like, I got some dope-ass</i>
<i>[bleep] planned out.</i>

04:36.677 --> 04:38.877
<i>But I need y'all</i>
<i>to all be down</i>

04:38.879 --> 04:41.013
<i>And just do</i>
<i>what the [bleep] I say.</i>

04:41.015 --> 04:42.481
<i>I got this [bleep].</i>

04:42.483 --> 04:46.485
And June 1, 1863--yes.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.488
On 1863, they begin this raid.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.389
<i>So harriet tubman is, like,</i>

04:50.391 --> 04:52.057
<i>On the combahee river</i>
<i>and [bleep].</i>

04:52.059 --> 04:54.359
<i>She was like,</i>
<i>I'm down for this [bleep].</i>

04:54.361 --> 04:54.993
<i>Like, I'm ready.</i>

04:54.995 --> 04:56.061
<i>And so when</i>
<i>the raid started, like,</i>

04:56.063 --> 04:59.498
<i>She knew where the mines</i>
<i>and [bleep] were in the water.</i>

04:59.500 --> 05:02.701
<i>She and her team of mariners--</i>
<i>it would have been like,</i>

05:02.703 --> 05:04.503
<i>Aw, [bleep] that,</i>
<i>aw, [bleep] that.</i>

05:04.505 --> 05:06.038
<i>Like, we're not gonna</i>
<i>get caught</i>

05:06.040 --> 05:06.872
<i>By your stupid-ass traps,</i>

05:06.874 --> 05:07.773
<i>You [bleep] slave owners.</i>

05:07.775 --> 05:09.875
<i>And then the owners</i>
<i>of the plantation--</i>

05:09.877 --> 05:10.942
<i>These crazy-ass</i>
<i>racist white people</i>

05:10.944 --> 05:12.644
<i>Would see</i>
<i>all these black people coming,</i>

05:12.646 --> 05:15.380
<i>And they'd be like,</i>
<i>what the [bleep] is this?</i>

05:15.382 --> 05:17.349
What the--

05:17.351 --> 05:19.718
What the--the mic moved.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.386
-<i> Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.</i>

05:21.388 --> 05:24.823
- Is it still--

05:24.825 --> 05:25.824
I'm sorry.
I'm focused.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.460
<i>And they were like, hey,</i>
<i>hey, racist-ass white person.</i>

05:28.462 --> 05:31.396
<i>Here's another</i>
<i>racist-ass white person</i>

05:31.398 --> 05:32.464
<i>Here to warn you that,</i>

05:32.466 --> 05:33.932
<i>You know,</i>
<i>harriet tubman is coming</i>

05:33.934 --> 05:35.534
<i>With her army</i>
<i>full of bad bitches.</i>

05:35.536 --> 05:37.836
<i>And so then they would start</i>
<i>shooting and [bleep].</i>

05:37.838 --> 05:38.904
<i>But by then,</i>
<i>harriet tubman was like,</i>

05:38.906 --> 05:40.572
<i>Bitch, you're too late.</i>

05:40.574 --> 05:42.407
<i>Like, me and my people</i>
<i>are already here.</i>

05:42.409 --> 05:44.443
And guns back then was
[bleep], like,

05:44.445 --> 05:45.544
Just basic as [bleep].

05:45.546 --> 05:47.045
<i>Them guns wasn't doing [bleep].</i>

05:47.047 --> 05:49.081
<i>So they would take</i>
<i>their torches and [bleep]</i>

05:49.083 --> 05:50.015
<i>And be like, yah!</i>

05:50.017 --> 05:51.116
And go there--
and go in and just

05:51.118 --> 05:53.952
[bleep] burn these
plantations down and then dip.

05:53.954 --> 05:54.820
And then they would go again.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.054
<i>Like, this raid,</i>

05:56.056 --> 05:57.656
<i>It was 25 miles</i>
<i>along the combahee river.</i>

05:57.658 --> 06:02.461
<i>And they're just, like, burning</i>
<i>[bleep] down, freeing slaves,</i>

06:02.463 --> 06:03.662
<i>Getting on the boat,</i>
<i>traveling again,</i>

06:03.664 --> 06:05.697
<i>Avoiding the mines.</i>

06:05.699 --> 06:09.901
And so at the end of the day--
night--end of the raid,

06:09.903 --> 06:14.439
<i>Harriet tubman was like,</i>
<i>goddamn, I freed 750 slaves.</i>

06:14.441 --> 06:15.741
<i>Like, this [bleep]</i>
<i>is dope as hell.</i>

06:15.743 --> 06:19.511
<i>And her plan--it was</i>
<i>the first military operation</i>

06:19.513 --> 06:24.416
<i>That was executed</i>
<i>and led by an american woman.</i>

06:24.418 --> 06:26.952
And it was planned
by a former slave

06:26.954 --> 06:28.687
Who could not read or write,

06:28.689 --> 06:29.621
Who was only five feet tall,

06:29.623 --> 06:31.857
<i>Who was both black and a woman.</i>

06:31.859 --> 06:33.859
<i>And she still</i>
<i>pulled this [bleep] off.</i>

06:33.861 --> 06:34.926
<i>She helped the union</i>
<i>win the war.</i>

06:34.928 --> 06:39.498
<i>She freed, like, at least</i>
<i>1,000 slaves in her lifetime.</i>

06:39.500 --> 06:41.133
<i>She was just dope as hell.</i>

06:41.135 --> 06:43.869
God, black people have been
through so much [bleep].

06:43.871 --> 06:46.705
Black people have been
through so much.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.741
- I don't know
how to respond to that.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.009
- [laughs]

06:51.011 --> 06:53.745
-<i> Except I agree.</i>

06:59.685 --> 07:02.020
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

07:02.022 --> 07:05.724
- I'm sorry.
Tell me your australian accent?

07:05.726 --> 07:06.691
- I can't do accents.

07:06.693 --> 07:07.826
- Can you say "fair crack
of the whip, mate"?

07:07.828 --> 07:09.528
- And is that saying,
like, good job?

07:09.530 --> 07:12.898
- No, it's like,
give me a fair go.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.832
- Okay.

07:13.834 --> 07:14.966
Fair crip--

07:14.968 --> 07:16.935
Fair...Grip.

07:16.937 --> 07:17.669
- Crack.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.838
- Fair crack of the whip, mate.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.973
- It's not terrible.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.543
- Fair crack of the whip, mate.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.844
Believable?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.045
- [laughs]

07:27.047 --> 07:29.981
- Where does our story
take place?

07:29.983 --> 07:32.117
- It takes place
all over the place.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.654
But the story starts
in baltimore.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.055
<i>Are you from baltimore?</i>

07:37.057 --> 07:38.123
-<i> Bal'more.</i>

07:38.992 --> 07:39.858
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.726
Hello, I'm claudia o'doherty,

07:47.668 --> 07:51.603
<i>So in 1906, in baltimore,</i>

08:15.629 --> 08:17.496

08:38.118 --> 08:39.251

10:07.307 --> 10:08.773
'cause she didn't think
she did have a limp,

10:08.775 --> 10:11.810

of the story, right?

10:11.812 --> 10:15.080

<i>I can't go through</i>
<i>any of the checkpoints.</i>

10:41.775 --> 10:43.908
<i>So because</i>
<i>she's got no other option,</i>

10:43.910 --> 10:48.146
<i>She hikes over the snowy</i>
<i>pyrenees mountains</i>

10:48.148 --> 10:51.216

<i>But you're gonna need</i>
<i>a really good disguise.</i>

11:03.163 --> 11:05.063

11:05.065 --> 11:06.731
<i>Put on two skirts</i>
<i>and two sweaters,</i>

11:06.733 --> 11:08.900

11:12.339 --> 11:14.806
- She looks like mrs. Doubtfire.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.640
- Exactly.

<i>And also, she shuffled so she</i>
<i>didn't have a limp anymore.</i>

<i>And bill stephenson's like,</i>
<i>hey, what's going on with you?</i>

16:41.701 --> 16:45.303
<i>And dahl's just like,</i>
<i>I want to help out England.</i>

16:45.305 --> 16:46.671
<i>I didn't bust my nuff--</i>

16:46.673 --> 16:49.574
<i>I didn't bust my nut enough</i>
<i>in England.</i>

16:49.576 --> 16:50.508
<i>And I still didn't do enough.</i>

16:50.510 --> 16:52.110
<i>Stephenson was like,</i>
<i>well, I-I--</i>

16:52.112 --> 16:54.479
<i>There is other stuff</i>
<i>you can do.</i>

16:54.481 --> 16:58.649
<i>So dahl was hired into</i>
<i>a dark propaganda section</i>

16:58.651 --> 16:59.684
<i>Referred to as the bsc,</i>

16:59.686 --> 17:01.786
<i>Which stands for</i>
<i>british security council.</i>

17:01.788 --> 17:03.054
<i>And a lot of other people</i>
<i>were hired:</i>

17:03.056 --> 17:05.089
<i>Noel coward, who was a famous</i>
<i>playwright and actor,</i>

17:05.091 --> 17:09.127
<i>And also ian fleming,</i>
<i>who some people might know</i>

17:09.129 --> 17:11.129
<i>As james [bleep] bond.</i>

17:11.131 --> 17:11.896
<i>And stephenson was like,</i>

17:11.898 --> 17:14.365
<i>Let's put you into</i>
<i>some good political parties,</i>

17:14.367 --> 17:16.501
<i>And meet everyone</i>
<i>you [bleep] can</i>

17:16.503 --> 17:19.070
<i>And report everything</i>
<i>back to us.</i>

17:19.072 --> 17:19.771
<i>He was like, okay.</i>

17:19.773 --> 17:21.139
<i>So here's</i>
<i>roald [bleep] dahl,</i>

17:21.141 --> 17:23.241
<i>Tall, handsome [bleep],</i>

17:23.243 --> 17:26.344
<i>Long-ass face,</i>
<i>eloquent-ass tongue.</i>

17:26.346 --> 17:27.712
<i>But every time</i>
<i>when he was at the party,</i>

17:27.714 --> 17:30.314
<i>Like, he'd be eavesdropping</i>
<i>on newspaper people,</i>

17:30.316 --> 17:32.817
<i>Politicians</i>
<i>and secretly just, like,</i>

17:32.819 --> 17:36.087
<i>Scribbling, you know, little</i>
<i>things on, like, napkins</i>

17:36.089 --> 17:36.954
<i>And reporting it to England.</i>

17:36.956 --> 17:41.259
He would also get into finding
information through pillow talk.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.328
<i>So he had a list of ladies</i>
<i>that he would go through,</i>

17:44.330 --> 17:48.099
Like cissy patterson
had her claws

17:48.101 --> 17:50.168
Into the
"washington herald-times,"

17:50.170 --> 17:52.703
<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>you want to see the boudoir?</i>

17:52.705 --> 17:53.604
<i>And he's like, yes please.</i>

17:53.606 --> 17:55.807
<i>So he [bleep] the [bleep]</i>
<i>out of her for a while</i>

17:55.809 --> 17:57.141
<i>And got whatever information</i>
<i>that he could.</i>

17:57.143 --> 17:59.644
<i>Then he went to evalyn mclean.</i>

17:59.646 --> 18:01.079
<i>She knew every politician</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

18:01.081 --> 18:03.381
<i>So they [bleep] a lot.</i>

18:03.383 --> 18:05.516
<i>So he met claire booth luce.</i>

18:05.518 --> 18:09.220
She was a congresswoman,
and they [bleep].

18:09.222 --> 18:13.224
And he got so much information
through so much of his dick.

18:13.226 --> 18:16.160
<i>But after a while,</i>
<i>and this is an exact quote,</i>

18:16.162 --> 18:18.196
<i>Like, he called ambassador</i>
<i>halifax and was like,</i>

18:18.198 --> 18:21.699
<i>Look,</i>
<i>I am [bleep] out, okay?</i>

18:21.701 --> 18:22.800

<i>I'm done. I can't do it.</i>
<i>I'm squirting dust.</i>

18:27.240 --> 18:29.173
<i>And the ambassador's like,</i>

18:29.175 --> 18:31.275
<i>Just close your eyes</i>
<i>and think of England.</i>

18:31.277 --> 18:34.645
<i>And dahl's like, great, okay.</i>
<i>I guess I will.</i>

18:34.647 --> 18:35.746
- Get your chin
off my neck.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.516
- I'm just--
no, it's--

18:38.518 --> 18:41.452
No, that wasn't--
my chin wasn't on you at all.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.287
- I feel like we're
