01:04.336 --> 01:06.335
The story so far:

01:06.337 --> 01:08.336
In Brussels,
Becky made a triumphant entrance

01:08.337 --> 01:10.336
into high society

01:10.337 --> 01:12.856
on the winnings
of her talented husband.

01:12.857 --> 01:16.856
I believe your Rawdon is widely
famed for his skills as a player.

01:16.857 --> 01:20.336
Becky's charms worked
all too well on the wrong man.

01:20.337 --> 01:22.336
Bad and wicked woman!

01:22.337 --> 01:24.336
False friend and false wife!

01:24.337 --> 01:28.336
The world at war,
the women left behind.

01:28.337 --> 01:29.337
The battle so close.

01:29.338 --> 01:33.336
Tonight, Becky decides
that war isn't so bad,

01:33.337 --> 01:35.336
so long as there's money to be made.

01:35.337 --> 01:37.856
Yes, it's Vanity Fair.

01:37.857 --> 01:40.336
A world where
everyone is striving...

01:40.337 --> 01:42.337
for what is not worth having.

02:25.377 --> 02:27.376
If we don't get there soon,
it'll all be over

02:27.377 --> 02:30.336
without this regiment firing a shot.

02:30.337 --> 02:32.043
Somehow I doubt that, George.

03:03.337 --> 03:05.336
Lord, the poor fellow, sir.

03:05.337 --> 03:08.336
Help will come to them.
Eyes forward, lad.

03:08.337 --> 03:10.336
We will fight together bravely,

03:10.337 --> 03:12.336
as we've been trained to do.

03:12.337 --> 03:14.337
No harm shall come to us.

03:31.337 --> 03:35.337
Gosh, gosh, gosh!

03:37.337 --> 03:39.337
Dear. Dear me!

03:42.337 --> 03:44.857
Keep calm, don't panic!
Dear heavens!

04:06.891 --> 04:08.210
Mr Joseph!

04:08.211 --> 04:10.210
How is your poor, dear sister today?

04:10.211 --> 04:13.050
He... says that the French
have left 20,000 British dead

04:13.051 --> 04:15.890
upon the battlefield,
and she says the army are retreating

04:15.891 --> 04:17.209
in the utmost confusion!

04:17.211 --> 04:19.209
Rumours?
Yes.

04:19.211 --> 04:20.730
The French are within
ten miles of the city

04:20.731 --> 04:23.210
and have orders to kill every man
within the walls.

04:23.211 --> 04:25.210
Did you find any horses?

04:25.211 --> 04:26.250
Non. Try again!

04:26.251 --> 04:28.211
Merde!

04:29.211 --> 04:30.976
Yes, my sister, good question!

04:38.211 --> 04:40.250
Even I, a peer of the realm,

04:40.251 --> 04:44.050
cannot be expected to spirit horses
out of thin air

04:44.051 --> 04:45.210
during a battle, madam.

04:45.211 --> 04:47.210
Shame on a husband
who cannot defend the virtue

04:47.211 --> 04:50.210
of his weak and feeble lady.

04:50.211 --> 04:53.210
Weak and what...? Good God, madam,
have you never looked in the mirror?

04:53.211 --> 04:56.210
Testing times, my Lord Bareacres.
Indeed!

04:56.211 --> 05:01.210
Madam, if you should know
of any horses hereabouts that have,

05:01.211 --> 05:03.210
er, yet to be requisitioned...

05:03.211 --> 05:06.210
None to be had for love nor money.

05:06.211 --> 05:08.211
You do know there's a war on?

05:29.571 --> 05:32.210
Here, my darlings.

05:32.211 --> 05:33.410
Here I am.

05:33.411 --> 05:35.211
Do you miss my Rawdon?

05:42.211 --> 05:45.210
Madame!

05:45.211 --> 05:46.211
Shh! Silence!

05:50.211 --> 05:53.210
The boy will tell the lords,
the lords will tell the ladies,

05:53.211 --> 05:56.730
and you... my pretty ones...

05:56.731 --> 05:58.411
will make my fortune today.

06:02.211 --> 06:05.506
Sounds just like my grandmother
shaking out her blankets.

06:09.571 --> 06:11.210
Tiffin?

06:11.211 --> 06:13.210
Your husband mustn't find you ill

06:13.211 --> 06:17.210
when he sends for you
after the victory.

06:17.211 --> 06:21.210
I can't.
Try, Emmy.

06:21.211 --> 06:23.211
Please try!

06:24.211 --> 06:26.210
The soup is very good.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.251
How can I eat?

06:31.211 --> 06:35.329
Remember, you're not the only woman
whose life is in God's hands today.

06:51.891 --> 06:53.210
Begging your pardon, miss.

06:53.211 --> 06:55.210
Lady Bareacres sends
her compliments,

06:55.211 --> 06:58.682
and desires to know the price
of Captain Crawley's horses...

06:59.251 --> 07:02.211
...what are hidden in the stables.

07:03.211 --> 07:05.210
How odd...

07:05.211 --> 07:08.210
that your mistress should think
it could ever be in my custom

07:08.211 --> 07:10.329
to transact business with a servant.

07:19.051 --> 07:20.890
Send me her lady's maid, would she?

07:20.891 --> 07:23.210
Whatever next -
would her ladyship require me

07:23.211 --> 07:24.211
to saddle the horses myself?

07:24.212 --> 07:28.211
Muck out their stables?
I am insulted, sir!

07:30.211 --> 07:31.410
Yes.

07:31.411 --> 07:33.051
Quite.

08:04.211 --> 08:08.211
Can you hear something?
Halt!

08:18.211 --> 08:20.211
Quiet, boy!

08:29.051 --> 08:31.211
Cavalry ride! Full speed ahead!

08:34.571 --> 08:37.210
Protect the colours!

08:37.211 --> 08:39.571
We're too late.
Gad, they're upon us.

08:50.211 --> 08:52.210
The French have broken through
our lines!

08:52.211 --> 08:54.211
Hold the line!

09:12.211 --> 09:16.211
Standard-bearer, to me! To me!

09:17.571 --> 09:19.211
Urgh!

09:22.891 --> 09:26.250
I cannot sell my horses
to such as will not love them.

09:26.251 --> 09:29.210
I shall love any creature
that will get me home to England.

09:29.211 --> 09:31.210
But you won't get home, my lady.

09:31.211 --> 09:34.210
The French are at the gates,
and they'll get you first.

09:34.211 --> 09:36.210
You, and the two great rubies
you wore

09:36.211 --> 09:38.211
to the Duchess of Richmond's ball.

09:39.211 --> 09:40.570
But fear not.

09:40.571 --> 09:43.210
I imagine the gems
will interest the savages much more

09:43.211 --> 09:45.211
than the lady who wears them.

09:47.211 --> 09:52.050
Sell to me, and not only
shall you have my rubies,

09:52.051 --> 09:56.210
but I shall so far extend my dignity

09:56.211 --> 10:01.211
as to invite you to dine
with your betters at Bareacres Hall.

10:02.211 --> 10:05.730
If I had any betters in this world,

10:05.731 --> 10:10.730
Bareacres Hall is the last place
I should expect to find them.

10:10.731 --> 10:12.251
Name your price, woman!

10:15.731 --> 10:17.211
Beyond rubies.

10:32.571 --> 10:35.210
Are you hurt?

10:35.211 --> 10:37.730
There we go, darling.
You all right?

10:37.731 --> 10:42.211
The strumpet refuses to sell!

10:48.731 --> 10:52.210
"March to Waterloo," he says.

10:52.211 --> 10:54.250
I can't see any such place
on this map.

10:54.251 --> 10:56.210
Crawley!

10:56.211 --> 10:58.051
CRAWLEY!

11:01.211 --> 11:04.211
Where in buggeration is Waterloo?

11:07.211 --> 11:10.570
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

11:10.571 --> 11:15.211
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

11:16.211 --> 11:19.210
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

11:19.211 --> 11:22.210
He restoreth my soul.

11:22.211 --> 11:24.210
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness.

11:24.211 --> 11:25.730
The guns!

11:25.731 --> 11:28.210
What?

11:28.211 --> 11:30.211
The guns, listen!
They are silent!

11:34.211 --> 11:36.211
So they are.

11:37.211 --> 11:38.506
For tonight, at least.

11:45.211 --> 11:47.210
The men on that hill over there.

11:47.211 --> 11:48.250
I see no hill.

11:48.251 --> 11:50.210
Not in this murk.

11:50.211 --> 11:52.210
Hundreds of them.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.210
Thousands.

11:54.211 --> 11:57.211
All God's creatures,
just like you and me, George.

11:59.211 --> 12:02.210
And yet, tonight, with all my soul,

12:02.211 --> 12:05.211
I wish them as dead
as the earth they sit upon.

12:08.051 --> 12:09.250
What kind of world would it be

12:09.251 --> 12:13.251
if the wishes of dear old Dobbin
of ours fell always on deaf ears?

12:26.211 --> 12:30.211
Ours shall be the glory, old friend.
Depend upon it.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.407
Mr Joseph!

12:44.408 --> 12:45.727
Sit.

12:45.728 --> 12:47.087
No appetite?

12:47.088 --> 12:48.727
What can ail you so?

12:48.728 --> 12:50.727
A most tragical want of horses.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.727
What do you need horses for?

12:52.728 --> 12:55.727
You can't imagine Amelia would leave
without her husband.

12:55.728 --> 12:58.727
And clearly, you would not leave
without your sister, so...

12:58.728 --> 13:01.727
...here we shall remain...

13:01.728 --> 13:04.247
to await a fate worse than death.

13:04.248 --> 13:06.247
They say the enemy
shall spare the women.

13:06.248 --> 13:07.728
How unusual!

13:09.088 --> 13:11.768
I do fear for you, Mr Joseph.

13:13.568 --> 13:17.392
Should the French find you looking
quite so much the military man.

13:35.728 --> 13:39.727
Your military greatcoat, monsieur,
with the gold frogging.

13:39.728 --> 13:41.728
Take it!

13:43.728 --> 13:46.727
Your velvet cap
with the ostrich feath... Take it!

13:46.728 --> 13:49.728
Take what you like,
but find me some damned horses!

13:55.728 --> 13:57.728
I have heard a rumour, sir.

14:01.248 --> 14:03.727
Beneath a confident rider,
he is as quiet as a lamb

14:03.728 --> 14:05.727
and as fast as a hare.

14:05.728 --> 14:07.727
Can he stand my weight?
And strong as an ox!

14:07.728 --> 14:09.727
So you and Amelia on Bullfinch,

14:09.728 --> 14:12.567
and your servant and Mrs O'Dowd
on Foxcub.

14:12.568 --> 14:14.727
Buy both animals?

14:14.728 --> 14:16.727
The horses are inseparable, sir.

14:16.728 --> 14:17.787
As are the ladies.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.727
But when my Rawdon comes home.

14:22.728 --> 14:25.728
IF he comes home. Mr Sedley!

14:26.728 --> 14:29.087
Mrs Crawley...

14:29.088 --> 14:33.567
I beg you,
how much for Bullfinch and Foxcub?

14:33.568 --> 14:34.727
It'll break his heart.

14:34.728 --> 14:36.846
Becky, for the love of God,
how much?

15:14.408 --> 15:17.767
God forgive you, Mr Sedley, for you
are nothing better than a coward!

15:17.768 --> 15:19.727
Don't listen to HER, Emmy.

15:19.728 --> 15:21.727
Fine sight I would be
riding pillion

15:21.728 --> 15:24.727
behind that great dandy!

15:24.728 --> 15:27.767
I have two horses. I have near
bankrupted myself to get them.

15:27.768 --> 15:30.727
I don't budge till I get
the word from Mick!

15:30.728 --> 15:33.728
And I'm not asking you,
you mad Paddy witch!

15:35.088 --> 15:38.767
Amelia, dear sister,
for the last time,

15:38.768 --> 15:40.728
will you come with me?

15:42.728 --> 15:45.728
Joseph, dearest brother...

15:47.568 --> 15:49.745
...I cannot leave without my husband.

15:51.728 --> 15:53.728
Then dear God preserve you.

16:04.728 --> 16:07.408
How bad is it?

16:09.568 --> 16:10.728
Now, look.

16:12.088 --> 16:14.568
Our first poor fellows are back.
Come on.

16:21.408 --> 16:25.087
George, George... Please, God!
Don't wish for anything,

16:25.088 --> 16:27.728
and remember, we are in God's hands.

16:31.568 --> 16:32.728
God!

16:36.728 --> 16:37.728
George!

16:37.729 --> 16:40.247
Mrs Osborne.

16:40.248 --> 16:42.087
Ambushed.
George?

16:42.088 --> 16:45.727
He lives.
Thanks be to God!

16:45.728 --> 16:47.727
The Major?
All spared.

16:47.728 --> 16:51.727
Captain Dobbin said
I was to be taken in here.

16:51.728 --> 16:53.727
You've to pay the driver
two Napoleons.

16:53.728 --> 16:55.727
My mother will pay you back.

16:55.728 --> 16:57.727
Right. Yes!
Who can help him, come on.

16:57.728 --> 16:59.088
Help him down.

17:03.408 --> 17:04.728
Be careful!

17:07.728 --> 17:10.727
Epaulettes, plumes,
straight from the battlefield.

17:10.728 --> 17:11.728
The blood still warm

17:11.729 --> 17:14.727
on some of this latest German stuff,
madame.

17:14.728 --> 17:16.728
No, I only want French ones.

17:18.728 --> 17:21.728
Onwards, Isidor.
Ever onwards!

17:23.728 --> 17:25.728
You can get a new hat.

17:26.728 --> 17:30.727
It was Captain Osborne who cut down
the Frenchman who slashed me.

17:30.728 --> 17:32.727
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

17:32.728 --> 17:35.727
Voila. Voila.
He was a hero.

17:35.728 --> 17:38.087
And so is Dobbin.

17:38.088 --> 17:41.030
Best officer in the army,
is Captain Dobbin, ma'am.

17:42.408 --> 17:44.727
So kind. And modest,
and cool under fire.

17:44.728 --> 17:47.928
And so... we saw them off.
And so the war is over?

17:50.728 --> 17:52.727
Lord, no, miss.

17:52.728 --> 17:53.728
No.

17:56.728 --> 17:59.199
They're only waiting
for the ground to dry.

18:01.728 --> 18:03.728
Come on, be brave. Come on.

18:20.728 --> 18:22.727
That's it.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.087
Well prepared.

18:25.088 --> 18:26.728
Brave lads, all.

18:27.728 --> 18:29.727
The French artillery
are coming about.

18:29.728 --> 18:34.727
Indeed they are. Tell the 44th
and the 47th to expect cavalry.

18:34.728 --> 18:35.728
Right.

19:11.728 --> 19:13.434
Sergeant Major, fix bayonets.

19:14.768 --> 19:17.727
Battalion will fix bayonets.

19:17.728 --> 19:19.728
Battalion fix bayonets!

19:23.728 --> 19:25.728
Prepare to receive cavalry!

19:28.728 --> 19:31.728
Prepare to receive cavalry!

19:34.768 --> 19:37.728
Steady! Their artillery
is coming into range.

20:01.728 --> 20:03.088
Hold the line, men!

20:07.728 --> 20:08.928
Steady, boys!

20:18.248 --> 20:20.728
Into your hands, O Lord.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.928
Steady your nerves!
Keep the line tight!

20:35.728 --> 20:37.728
Steady!
Hold your positions!

20:38.928 --> 20:43.727
Keep the line tight.
Hold force!

20:43.728 --> 20:45.728
Sir...

20:50.728 --> 20:53.728
May they be cut down
like a field of corn!

20:56.928 --> 20:58.727
Sergeant Major, block up.

20:58.728 --> 21:00.727
Steady!

21:00.728 --> 21:01.728
Please, someone, help me!

21:01.729 --> 21:03.727
Hold the line!

21:03.728 --> 21:05.727
Captain Osborne!
Prepare to give fire.

21:05.728 --> 21:07.727
Prepare your fire!

21:07.728 --> 21:09.728
Wait!

21:10.768 --> 21:12.728
Hold your fire!

21:16.408 --> 21:18.767
Captain Osborne!
Open fire!

21:18.768 --> 21:20.727
I said hold your fire, damn you!

21:20.728 --> 21:23.727
Captain Osborne, hold your fire!

21:23.728 --> 21:25.728
Captain Osborne, wait!

21:27.728 --> 21:28.767
Open fire!

21:28.768 --> 21:30.728
B company, fire!

21:33.728 --> 21:35.728
B company, front right, fire!

21:41.248 --> 21:43.728
A company, centre, fire!

21:45.568 --> 21:47.728
B company, centre, fire!

22:13.768 --> 22:16.728
The French are retreating.

22:21.728 --> 22:22.728
Not for long.

22:27.728 --> 22:30.088
It's getting hard to see, sir.

23:37.248 --> 23:38.727
Vive la France!

23:38.728 --> 23:40.727
Vive la France!

23:40.728 --> 23:42.727
Vive la France!

23:42.728 --> 23:44.728
Vive la France!

23:59.728 --> 24:02.767
Here they come.
Steady, lads. Steady!

24:02.768 --> 24:03.928
Now!

24:09.568 --> 24:12.408
First rank... FIRE!

24:15.728 --> 24:17.728
Second rank, fire!

24:22.728 --> 24:24.727
Halt! Port arms!

24:24.728 --> 24:26.728
Charge bayonets.

24:27.728 --> 24:31.727
By the centre, ordinary march!

24:31.728 --> 24:36.728
Well done, lads,
take them all the way to Paris!

24:37.728 --> 24:39.728
Now is our time!

24:46.728 --> 24:48.728
NO!!

26:58.507 --> 27:01.506
It is a letter from Mrs Crawley.

27:01.507 --> 27:05.027
I see Rawdon has sold out
of the Guards as a colonel.

27:06.347 --> 27:10.547
Well, the valiant creature
does deserve a quieter life.

27:16.507 --> 27:18.507
...a pair of French epaulettes.

27:21.507 --> 27:23.743
With the Cross of the Legion
of Honour.

27:26.187 --> 27:29.506
And the hilt of a sword.

27:29.507 --> 27:31.546
And does Mrs Rebecca claim,
as usual,

27:31.547 --> 27:35.546
that the heroic Colonel Rawdon
cut said objects from a Frenchman,

27:35.547 --> 27:38.506
begging for his life?

27:38.507 --> 27:42.506
Well, it...
It could be true. Matilda.

27:42.507 --> 27:44.506
It was entertaining at first,

27:44.507 --> 27:47.506
but I'm bored
with the Battle of Waterloo.

27:47.507 --> 27:50.507
We did win, after all.

27:59.507 --> 28:01.037
Is Mrs Osborne quite well?

28:02.507 --> 28:04.507
Is Mrs Osborne warm enough?

28:13.507 --> 28:15.507
Whoa...

28:21.507 --> 28:24.506
Mr Osborne!
Drive on, damn you!

28:24.507 --> 28:25.507
Hold, driver!

28:25.508 --> 28:27.506
I will see you, sir.

28:27.507 --> 28:30.507
You presume to command me,
Captain Dobbin?

28:32.507 --> 28:35.506
Or must I now salute...
Major Dobbin?

28:35.507 --> 28:38.506
Since better men than you have died,

28:38.507 --> 28:41.506
and you step into their shoes?

28:41.507 --> 28:43.506
But the men are dead.

28:43.507 --> 28:45.507
Yes, sir.

28:49.507 --> 28:52.331
Nothing could have prepared us
for the slaughter.

28:53.507 --> 28:55.507
There were times when I thought...

28:57.347 --> 28:58.506
...I thought this might be
the only battle

28:58.507 --> 29:00.625
in the sorry history of the world...

29:01.507 --> 29:04.684
...when not a single man
on either side was left alive.

29:08.507 --> 29:09.866
Job was done.

29:09.867 --> 29:11.506
We move on.

29:11.507 --> 29:13.506
His widow is without means, sir.

29:13.507 --> 29:17.506
And soon the poor lady
will be a mother.

29:17.507 --> 29:21.506
Will you punish the child
for the sins of the parent,

29:21.507 --> 29:25.506
or will you forgive the child,
your grandchild, sir?

29:25.507 --> 29:27.506
For the sake of George,

29:27.507 --> 29:30.684
who fought more bravely
than even you could have hoped.

29:36.507 --> 29:41.507
That boy died without
ever confessing he did me wrong.

29:44.507 --> 29:48.506
Without... ever apologising
to a father...

29:48.507 --> 29:51.507
he wronged so wickedly.

29:55.507 --> 29:59.507
Believe me, he deeply regretted
the loss of your affection.

30:02.507 --> 30:06.507
She may have seven children
and starve, for all I care.

30:09.027 --> 30:11.547
She is dead to me.

30:27.507 --> 30:30.507
Don't cry, little man.

30:35.507 --> 30:37.866
How am I supposed to know
what's the matter with him?

30:37.867 --> 30:40.506
It's a long journey,
perhaps he's tired.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.706
Or hungry.
Are you hungry, little man?

30:42.707 --> 30:45.884
Well, he'll have to learn to wait,
like the rest of us.

30:46.547 --> 30:50.506
Is that nice?
Did you like that? Did you?

30:50.507 --> 30:51.546
Yes, you did.

30:51.547 --> 30:54.506
I don't know why you bother when
there'll be servants at the hotel.

30:54.507 --> 30:58.506
He likes it better from me,
don't you, young man?

30:58.507 --> 31:01.506
Who's a nice soldier?
Who's my little soldier?

31:01.507 --> 31:03.507
Who's my little soldier?

31:04.507 --> 31:06.506
Right, it's been long enough.

31:06.507 --> 31:09.506
We must go back to London.
Why?

31:09.507 --> 31:13.346
Because...
he is the image of you.

31:13.347 --> 31:14.818
And the money's all gone.

31:56.187 --> 31:58.346
Shh!
I brought him something.

31:58.347 --> 31:59.706
So sweet, William.

31:59.707 --> 32:04.507
What would we do without you?
Just pop them over there quietly.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.506
It's wonderful to see
the change in you, Amelia.

32:23.507 --> 32:28.507
He is so beautiful.
So like my George, isn't he?

32:30.507 --> 32:33.507
Perfect.

32:36.507 --> 32:38.506
I am come to say goodbye.

32:38.507 --> 32:40.507
Why, where are you going?

32:41.507 --> 32:44.506
The... the regiment
is under orders for India.

32:44.507 --> 32:46.507
I shall be gone a very long time.

32:48.507 --> 32:51.347
I'll write to you.

32:52.507 --> 32:53.507
All about Georgie.

32:53.508 --> 32:57.507
All his adventures,
and all his scrapes.

32:58.507 --> 33:02.027
Dear William,
how good you've been to us both.

33:03.507 --> 33:05.187
Come closer.

33:10.507 --> 33:11.507
Look at him.

33:12.547 --> 33:14.507
Isn't he an angel?

33:24.027 --> 33:26.507
He is shaking your hand goodbye.

33:31.507 --> 33:33.507
God bless you both.

33:44.507 --> 33:46.507
Present arms.

33:52.027 --> 33:54.507
Mrs Crawley.

33:55.507 --> 33:57.867
I thought you were the doctor.

34:05.507 --> 34:09.505
I wish the doctor would come.
I did not know what to do.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.507
She will not let me near her.

34:12.507 --> 34:15.507
Dear Miss Crawley.

34:16.706 --> 34:19.505
Remember how well I nursed you once?

34:19.507 --> 34:22.507
Please, heaven, this time.

34:23.507 --> 34:26.507
I shall nurse you again,
if you'll permit me.

34:30.507 --> 34:32.507
I'm so sorry.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.802
Everything's gone wrong
since we parted.

34:37.507 --> 34:39.507
I regret it so much.

34:41.027 --> 34:44.346
I love Rawdon and he loves me.

34:44.347 --> 34:46.347
But I never wanted to be a mother.

34:47.507 --> 34:50.860
I never had one of my own,
I don't know how to be one now.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.505
And to be excluded
from the light of your love

34:55.507 --> 34:56.507
has caused us so much hurt.

34:56.507 --> 34:59.507
Miss Crawley, please forgive us!

35:34.507 --> 35:36.187
We could move in.

35:38.507 --> 35:40.507
What, here?
Why not?

35:41.507 --> 35:43.507
Because it's not ours.

35:46.347 --> 35:50.346
Because, the whole family
will stand up and drive us out.

35:50.347 --> 35:51.506
Why can't you see that?

35:51.507 --> 35:53.026
Well, where do you suggest
we all live?

35:53.027 --> 35:55.507
For our invalid.

35:58.507 --> 36:02.507
Mr Raggles, such terrible news!

36:04.507 --> 36:07.506
It's not a palace, Mrs Crawley.

36:07.507 --> 36:10.026
Not even a mansion such as
you and the Colonel are used to.

36:10.027 --> 36:12.506
It's quite charming, Mr Raggles.

36:12.507 --> 36:14.506
Some might say it's a big step

36:14.507 --> 36:17.866
for such as me and Mrs Raggles
to set ourselves up as landlords.

36:17.867 --> 36:23.507
Why shouldn't honest working people
see the fruits of their labours?

36:37.507 --> 36:38.507
We can't afford Mayfair.

36:38.508 --> 36:40.506
As soon your aunt's will is read.

36:40.507 --> 36:43.213
The poor old girl
is not yet cold in her grave.

36:44.507 --> 36:47.507
And who's to say
if she will favour us at last?

36:49.027 --> 36:52.506
I, Matilda Crawley, do by this,
my last will and testament,

36:52.507 --> 36:56.506
further give and bequeath
to my companion of many years,

36:56.507 --> 37:02.506
Miss Arabella Briggs,
my second-best tea service

37:02.507 --> 37:04.506
and the sum of £600.

37:04.507 --> 37:08.186
No, not deserved.

37:08.187 --> 37:09.706
No, no!

37:09.707 --> 37:12.506
To my younger nephew,
Rawdon Crawley,

37:12.507 --> 37:16.506
My prize collection of souvenirs
from the Battle of Waterloo,

37:16.507 --> 37:18.507
and a single payment of...

37:21.547 --> 37:23.506
...yes...

37:23.507 --> 37:24.706
one hundred pounds...

37:24.707 --> 37:27.506
in full valuation of my esteem

37:27.507 --> 37:29.684
for the choices he's made
in his life.

37:32.507 --> 37:33.867
Dear!

37:35.507 --> 37:38.506
My poor dear Rawdon!

37:38.507 --> 37:41.507
You jumped the wrong way there,
Becky, my girl.

37:43.867 --> 37:47.506
The residual part of my estate,
the house and some £70,000,

37:47.507 --> 37:52.506
I leave to my nephew, Bute,
and his heirs in perpetuity.

37:52.507 --> 37:55.186
They poisoned her against us,
the villains!

37:55.187 --> 37:58.346
The smug, poisonous,
black-hearted devils!

37:58.347 --> 38:00.506
All the rage in the world
won't get us your aunt's money now.

38:00.507 --> 38:03.507
Rawdon, listen to me.
Listen!

38:04.507 --> 38:06.866
We must stay friends
with your brother.

38:06.867 --> 38:09.506
There's no point making enemies
where the money is,

38:09.507 --> 38:11.506
and if things go really badly, well,

38:11.507 --> 38:14.346
I'll be his governess
and you can be his butler.

38:14.347 --> 38:16.507
No? All right, stable boy.

38:17.507 --> 38:20.347
Dearest husband, show me a smile.

38:21.347 --> 38:22.707
You know I'm right.

38:25.507 --> 38:28.506
And why shouldn't I live in Mayfair?

38:28.507 --> 38:31.507
Because I cannot afford the rent.

38:34.187 --> 38:36.506
Listen to me.

38:36.507 --> 38:38.866
This shall be our gaming room.

38:38.867 --> 38:41.506
Here, you will play
all-comers in all games.

38:41.507 --> 38:44.506
Faro, piquet, ecarte.

38:44.507 --> 38:47.506
It'll be like a club.
In a private house.

38:47.507 --> 38:51.346
Warm, comfortable, respectable.

38:51.347 --> 38:54.186
You will win, except when
I judge it helpful for you to lose,

38:54.187 --> 38:57.070
and I will grow in charm
with each profitable day.

38:57.507 --> 38:59.507
What could possibly go wrong?

39:03.507 --> 39:05.507
Mrs Rawdon Crawley...

39:10.507 --> 39:12.506
This might be...

39:12.507 --> 39:14.507
your best plan yet.

39:23.858 --> 39:26.178
Good morning.
Good morning.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.456
Look, Georgie, happy Christmas.

39:44.132 --> 39:48.131
I wish you could see how delighted
he is with the gifts you send.

39:48.132 --> 39:51.131
William.
I wish you could see him growing up.

39:51.132 --> 39:52.331
Rules over us.

39:52.332 --> 39:56.131
Rules over us all.
As did his father.

39:56.132 --> 39:59.811
Every night, we pray together,
to ask our dear Lord

39:59.812 --> 40:01.652
to bless my husband, as if...

40:03.132 --> 40:05.131
...as if he had not left us.

40:05.132 --> 40:07.544
And we always add
a little prayer for you.

40:08.172 --> 40:12.131
For our only friend,
on the other side of the world,

40:12.132 --> 40:13.132
in India.

40:18.132 --> 40:21.131
Major Dobbin,
won't you join us for a cup of tea?

40:21.132 --> 40:25.132
I... I'm afraid... Um...
Excuse me.

40:47.132 --> 40:51.131
Dear Jane,
I hope this letter finds you well,

40:51.132 --> 40:54.132
and the worst of your grief is past.

40:56.172 --> 41:00.812
I think of your dear brother
every day and mourn his loss.

41:02.132 --> 41:08.131
I think also of his child,
and the poor widow he left behind.

41:08.132 --> 41:12.132
I wish with all my heart they had
a friend closer than 5,000 miles.

41:15.132 --> 41:19.131
I still long to believe,
for George's sake,

41:19.132 --> 41:22.132
your father's heart
may one day melt.

41:57.132 --> 42:01.172
In God's name, Miss Osborne,
what is the matter with you tonight?

42:04.132 --> 42:06.132
I've seen him, sir.

42:09.132 --> 42:10.331
I've seen little George,

42:10.332 --> 42:14.131
and, sir,
he's as beautiful as an angel,

42:14.132 --> 42:16.132
and he's the living image of...

42:29.132 --> 42:31.131
Who are you?
What do you want?

42:31.132 --> 42:33.172
Georgie! Where are your manners?

42:37.132 --> 42:41.131
I am alone here.
Just a little ride together.

42:41.132 --> 42:42.171
Just half an hour.

42:42.172 --> 42:45.131
My parents are from home, Jane.

42:45.132 --> 42:46.838
It's the child's grandfather.

42:49.132 --> 42:51.132
Amelia! Please...

42:56.132 --> 42:57.132
Wait there.

43:05.332 --> 43:07.131
Ready?

43:07.132 --> 43:08.652
Go to Auntie Jane.

43:28.132 --> 43:31.131
So, young George.

43:31.132 --> 43:33.131
Yes, sir?

43:33.132 --> 43:35.131
Do you know who I am?

43:35.132 --> 43:36.331
No, sir.

43:36.332 --> 43:39.131
I'm your grandfather.

43:39.132 --> 43:41.132
No, you're not!

43:57.132 --> 44:00.131
Marry again?

44:00.132 --> 44:04.131
He's very generous, if you listen,
he says even if you marry again,

44:04.132 --> 44:06.131
the allowance he makes you
will continue.

44:06.132 --> 44:08.131
Take money to part from my child?

44:08.132 --> 44:10.132
It doesn't say that.

44:12.132 --> 44:14.131
"It must be understood
that the child will live

44:14.132 --> 44:17.131
"entirely with his grandfather
at the Osborne residence,

44:17.132 --> 44:20.131
"and will be occasionally permitted
to see Mrs George Osborne."

44:20.132 --> 44:22.131
It is an insult!

44:22.132 --> 44:24.131
Amelia, it doesn't do to be selfish.

44:24.132 --> 44:27.331
You call a mother selfish
who will not give up her child?

44:27.332 --> 44:29.331
Mr Osborne says here
in black and white

44:29.332 --> 44:31.131
that he will make Georgie his heir,

44:31.132 --> 44:33.131
that he will inherit everything
his father lost...

44:33.132 --> 44:36.132
When he made the dreadful mistake
of marrying me

44:37.172 --> 44:40.331
Every child must leave
his mother's petticoats someday.

44:40.332 --> 44:42.131
I lost my husband.

44:42.132 --> 44:44.331
I will not lose my son!

44:44.332 --> 44:46.812
The answer is still no!

45:28.132 --> 45:30.132
Excuse me, gentlemen.

45:39.132 --> 45:41.131
No, you don't,
there'll be hell to pay

45:41.132 --> 45:43.250
if you disturb your mamma's singing!

45:44.972 --> 45:46.331
Please take Rawdy up to bed.

45:46.332 --> 45:48.132
I don't want to!

46:08.132 --> 46:11.131
Why can't I stay down here
with you and Mamma?

46:11.132 --> 46:13.132
Hush, hush.

46:14.132 --> 46:17.132
You mustn't bother Mamma...
not when she has guests.

46:19.132 --> 46:22.172
There's a brave boy.
I wish Mamma would sing for me!

46:27.652 --> 46:29.811
Stay with him till he sleeps.

46:29.812 --> 46:33.132
Come on. Let's go back to bed.
I will sing you something.

46:35.132 --> 46:37.132
My Lord Steyne.

46:42.132 --> 46:45.132
And how is Mrs Crawley's husband?

46:46.132 --> 46:48.812
Still busy keeping
the wolf from the door?

47:03.132 --> 47:05.132
Milord.

47:07.132 --> 47:10.132
Comme je suis enchante.

47:11.305 --> 47:17.822
