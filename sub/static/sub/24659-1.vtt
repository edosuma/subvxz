00:36.484 --> 00:39.686
<i>You think you've
heard every Batman story.</i>

00:39.688 --> 00:42.122
<i>I promise, you haven't.</i>

00:42.124 --> 00:43.890
<i>I wouldn't have
believed it myself</i>

00:43.892 --> 00:46.824
<i>if I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes.</i>

00:46.826 --> 00:51.296
<i>And this time, curiosity
almost killed this cat.</i>

00:51.298 --> 00:54.467
<i>Shut it down, Grodd.
It's over. You're finished!</i>

00:54.469 --> 00:56.434
<i>No, I'm too close.</i>

00:56.436 --> 01:01.306
You will not interfere with my
experiment this time, Batman.

01:06.414 --> 01:07.615
Catwoman, don't!

01:56.063 --> 01:57.064
What?

01:59.900 --> 02:01.902
Where am I?
What happened?

02:10.009 --> 02:11.012
Hmm?

02:16.717 --> 02:19.755
It's Japanese.
And that's me.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.860
There he is,
get him!

02:28.862 --> 02:30.996
Samurai?

02:30.998 --> 02:34.402
Stop! Listen to me, I don't
want to hurt any of you.

02:37.338 --> 02:38.706
Fine, have it
your way.

02:41.008 --> 02:42.443
Explain yourself.

02:43.645 --> 02:46.779
We were sent to find the man
dressed as a bat.

02:46.781 --> 02:50.549
Our master has ordered us
to kill him on sight.

02:50.551 --> 02:52.817
He cannot be allowed to live.

02:52.819 --> 02:54.555
Who's your master?

04:28.815 --> 04:31.283
None of this makes any sense.

04:31.285 --> 04:32.685
Everything's offline.

04:32.687 --> 04:34.855
But from the look of it,
this is ancient Japan.

04:36.490 --> 04:39.860
Which doesn't explain
what's going on up there.

04:55.810 --> 04:57.209
<i>What?</i>

04:58.879 --> 05:00.579
- <i>The Joker?</i>
- So soon?

05:00.581 --> 05:02.281
That's right, Bats.

05:02.283 --> 05:04.017
It is I.

05:04.019 --> 05:04.884
Damn you!

05:09.122 --> 05:10.558
Hi.

05:12.093 --> 05:13.659
And Harley Quinn.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.961
Oh, but you
have to admit,

05:15.963 --> 05:19.365
we really had you
going there, didn't we?

05:19.367 --> 05:23.401
That's enough. What are you
playing at this time, Joker?

05:25.005 --> 05:26.973
Haven't you heard?
Everyone's been calling me

05:26.975 --> 05:29.774
Diruku Tin Mao,
The Demon King.

05:29.776 --> 05:31.810
The most powerful
man in Japan.

05:31.812 --> 05:33.682
But you can call me...

05:34.548 --> 05:37.683
Lord Joker.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.985
Oh, I never really
wanted to be a Lord.

05:39.987 --> 05:42.288
It wasn't what you would
call an aspiration.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.223
But when life throws
you time travels,

05:44.225 --> 05:46.457
sometimes you gotta make travelade.

05:46.459 --> 05:48.461
<i>Guess I have that monkey
to thank for this.</i>

05:48.463 --> 05:50.762
<i>If it wasn't for
his stupid machine</i>

05:50.764 --> 05:53.531
<i>this tiny island would have never been on my itinerary.</i>

05:53.533 --> 05:56.834
I have to say I've really
enjoyed the sushi here.

05:56.836 --> 06:00.074
Mwah. It's even better
with some sauce.

06:11.952 --> 06:14.688
Is it me, or is it
getting hot in here?

06:18.024 --> 06:21.260
Oh, don't run away.
I'm your biggest fan.

06:23.831 --> 06:28.336
<i>Oh, now, now, Batman, don't
you want to play anymore?</i>

06:29.504 --> 06:32.271
Oh, now look what you've done.

06:32.273 --> 06:36.408
Poison Ivy would be
very disappointed.

06:36.410 --> 06:38.510
Mmm.

06:38.512 --> 06:42.250
Don't you know how bad razor-edged
fighting fans are for the environment?

06:44.418 --> 06:46.252
You're the one who
keeps throwing them.

06:46.254 --> 06:48.857
Because you won't
let them hit you.

06:59.867 --> 07:02.000
Looks like you're
fresh out of those fans.

07:02.002 --> 07:04.773
So what are you
going to do now, Joker?

07:06.574 --> 07:09.875
Oh, I've got options, Bats.

07:09.877 --> 07:11.810
I've still
got Harley,

07:11.812 --> 07:15.383
and an army of Samurai who have you surrounded.

07:19.019 --> 07:21.389
Seven to one,
I'll take those odds.

07:48.749 --> 07:50.885
Should we go
after him, Lord J?

07:51.884 --> 07:53.819
I've got people.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.057
Let's just enjoy
the moonlight.

08:00.261 --> 08:03.965
We have all the time
in the world.

08:09.470 --> 08:12.373
Move, move.
He can't be far.

08:17.944 --> 08:19.480
Huh?

08:23.783 --> 08:25.286
Don't be afraid.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.622
It's just a little catcall.

08:29.624 --> 08:31.557
<i>Catwoman?</i>

08:31.559 --> 08:34.659
When I saw the
Joker's samurai on the move,

08:34.662 --> 08:36.328
I figured
something was up.

08:36.330 --> 08:38.129
I'm glad
it was you.

08:38.131 --> 08:39.664
How did you
get here?

08:39.667 --> 08:42.600
Same as you.
Gorilla Grodd's time machine.

08:42.602 --> 08:44.603
That was
two years ago.

08:44.605 --> 08:46.973
How is that
even possible?

08:46.975 --> 08:50.508
I downloaded these before the time jump.
Maybe they can help.

08:50.510 --> 08:54.079
<i>Say what's
your business, monkey.</i>

08:54.081 --> 08:56.147
<i>Why have you
brought us here?</i>

08:56.149 --> 08:59.951
<i>Criminals of Gotham
City, I've gathered you here</i>

08:59.953 --> 09:02.954
<i>to unveil
my greatest invention.</i>

09:02.956 --> 09:04.790
<i>Red Hood,
this is Nightwing.</i>

09:04.792 --> 09:07.225
<i>The lead paid off. It's like
a criminal convention here.</i>

09:07.227 --> 09:10.429
<i>Yeah, I can see them
from here too.</i>

09:10.431 --> 09:13.132
<i>Well, the Mayor's
party's tonight.</i>

09:13.134 --> 09:14.800
I wasn't alone.

09:14.802 --> 09:16.801
They were all there too.

09:16.803 --> 09:19.470
Nightwing, Red Hood,

09:19.472 --> 09:21.906
Red Robin, and Robin.

09:21.908 --> 09:23.743
So where are they?

09:23.745 --> 09:24.943
I don't know.

09:24.945 --> 09:27.212
I haven't seen
any of them.

09:27.214 --> 09:32.017
<i>But since arriving, Gotham's criminals
have run wild all over Japan.</i>

09:32.019 --> 09:34.619
<i>Behold, The Quake Engine.</i>

09:34.621 --> 09:38.223
<i>Now, witness as I become
master of time and space,</i>

09:38.225 --> 09:40.829
<i>and bend them to my will.</i>

09:48.903 --> 09:50.268
There are
no more images.

09:50.270 --> 09:52.637
The rest are
just audio files.

09:52.639 --> 09:55.974
Grodd's machine must
have affected the data transfer.

09:55.976 --> 09:58.076
<i>Now it's all
upside down.</i>

09:58.078 --> 10:01.780
<i>I think that monkey has been
mucking with our heads.</i>

10:01.782 --> 10:06.221
<i>You will not interfere
with my experiment this time, Bat...</i>

10:08.755 --> 10:12.858
So the Joker is just the unwitting
beneficiary of Grodd's experiment.

10:12.860 --> 10:16.630
Well, no one ever said
he didn't thrive in chaos.

10:17.932 --> 10:19.665
But we were there
at the same time,

10:19.667 --> 10:21.099
why the two year difference?

10:21.101 --> 10:23.401
Who knows how
time travel works?

10:23.403 --> 10:26.604
Grodd delayed me, and it
must have affected the jump.

10:26.606 --> 10:30.908
A matter of seconds then,
turned to be two years now.

10:30.910 --> 10:35.814
Selena, may I ask what were
you doing there that night?

10:35.816 --> 10:38.783
I can tell you I never thought
I'd end up here.

10:38.785 --> 10:42.555
I followed Gorilla Grodd to Arkham
to see what he was up to that night.

10:42.557 --> 10:46.326
If it was any good, I was
planning on stealing it.

10:46.961 --> 10:48.493
And the criminals?

10:48.495 --> 10:50.796
Like the Joker,
they've taken over.

10:50.798 --> 10:53.398
They've deceived
all the <i>Sengoku Daimyos</i>

10:53.400 --> 10:55.834
and become
lords of their states.

10:55.836 --> 10:57.502
<i>Sengoku Daimyo?</i>

10:57.504 --> 10:58.970
That's right.

10:58.972 --> 11:01.773
This period in Japan was a
feudal era of warring states.

11:01.775 --> 11:07.445
<i>Yes. Each of Gotham's criminals
is trying to conquer and unify Japan.</i>

11:07.447 --> 11:09.949
<i>The Penguin has seized control
of the state of Kai.</i>

11:09.951 --> 11:13.685
<i>He skirmishes repeatedly with the
neighboring state of Echigo,</i>

11:13.687 --> 11:15.655
<i>where Poison Ivy rules.</i>

11:17.124 --> 11:20.028
<i>Fly,
my fine-feathered friends.</i>

11:25.765 --> 11:28.937
<i>I'll bury you in
the dirt, you old buzzard.</i>

11:31.971 --> 11:35.640
<i>In the state of Nutsu,
Deathstroke reigns supreme.</i>

11:35.642 --> 11:37.608
<i>Once my fortress is complete,</i>

11:37.610 --> 11:41.613
<i>it'll be my turn
to strike. Yeah.</i>

11:41.615 --> 11:44.682
<i>Two-Face has taken
control in the state of Omie.</i>

11:44.684 --> 11:46.050
<i>Near the capital.</i>

11:46.052 --> 11:48.155
<i>He has become
a vassal of the Joker.</i>

11:50.390 --> 11:55.361
<i>Let's see, what will
my next move be?</i>

11:55.363 --> 12:00.565
<i>But right now, the feudal
lord who is closest to unifying Japan</i>

12:00.567 --> 12:01.970
<i>is the Joker.</i>

12:16.450 --> 12:20.685
So they're all trying to takeover
this country and rewrite history.

12:20.687 --> 12:23.955
We have to find Gorilla Grodd.
Have you seen him?

12:23.957 --> 12:26.324
Not recently.

12:26.326 --> 12:28.927
Why don't you and I
join forces, Bruce?

12:28.929 --> 12:30.595
Join forces?

12:30.597 --> 12:33.330
I want to go home. Two years
is a long time to be away.

12:33.332 --> 12:35.702
Okay. But
no tricks, Selena.

12:36.437 --> 12:37.603
Swear.

12:37.605 --> 12:40.738
We just have to
get into that tower.

12:40.740 --> 12:44.011
Joker keeps Grodd's
time machine in there.

13:00.126 --> 13:02.294
This missionary look
is not bad.

13:02.296 --> 13:05.998
There were quite a lot of Christian missionaries
that came to Japan during this era.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.967
This way you won't look
too suspicious as a westerner.

13:08.969 --> 13:11.871
The bat tonsure
is a nice touch.

13:11.873 --> 13:13.371
Thanks.

13:13.373 --> 13:15.074
So, why did you
bring me here?

13:15.076 --> 13:16.474
I wanted
you to see this.

13:16.476 --> 13:19.377
The Joker is up to
something strange.

13:19.379 --> 13:20.748
<i>Is that coal?</i>

13:22.350 --> 13:26.550
<i>So the Joker is
already changing the timeline.</i>

13:26.552 --> 13:29.921
The industrial revolution
wasn't until much later.

13:29.923 --> 13:33.291
I really doubt the Joker
cares much about history.

13:33.293 --> 13:35.560
My guess is whatever
he's doing,

13:35.562 --> 13:37.728
he'll use it
to become Shogun.

13:37.730 --> 13:39.897
But it's not
just the Joker.

13:39.899 --> 13:42.803
We'll have to defeat all of
Gotham's criminals to save history.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.737
We'll need weapons
for that.

13:45.739 --> 13:49.007
If only there were
someone who could help us.

13:49.009 --> 13:51.408
Care for
some tea, sir?

13:51.410 --> 13:53.647
Ah, much appreciated.

13:57.149 --> 13:58.717
Oh, is this is black tea?

13:58.719 --> 14:00.685
Hard to come by in these
neck of the woods.

14:00.687 --> 14:03.488
Hope you find it
to your liking.

14:03.490 --> 14:05.557
<i>Alfred.</i>

14:05.559 --> 14:09.828
It was Ms. Selena's idea.
I do apologize.

14:09.830 --> 14:12.863
<i>It's a bit more rustic
than you're accustomed to.</i>

14:12.865 --> 14:15.836
<i>But I think it makes for
a suitable bat cave.</i>

14:17.772 --> 14:19.637
What?

14:19.639 --> 14:22.074
I can't believe
you didn't tell me, Selena.

14:22.076 --> 14:25.710
I know, but I wanted to see the
look of surprise on your face.

14:25.712 --> 14:27.646
There's no need
to worry.

14:27.648 --> 14:30.482
The vehicle's been well
maintained, Master Bruce.

14:30.484 --> 14:33.451
But I don't understand.

14:33.453 --> 14:35.887
Alfred was in
the Batmobile that night.

14:35.889 --> 14:38.422
We were lucky enough
to find each other here.

14:38.424 --> 14:42.627
And we both figured it was only a
matter of time before you arrived.

14:42.629 --> 14:44.463
And here I am.

14:44.465 --> 14:48.233
<i>Well, I think the Joker would be
quite shocked to see you in it.</i>

14:48.235 --> 14:49.468
Yeah, let's hope.

14:49.470 --> 14:51.569
Well, I must confess

14:51.571 --> 14:54.940
that I'm quite relieved Ms. Selena
found you in the forest, Master Bruce.

14:54.942 --> 14:58.209
I, for one, have always wanted
to visit this beautiful country,

14:58.211 --> 15:01.579
but I'd much prefer to
do so in my own time.

15:01.581 --> 15:05.150
Although, I must admit, I've picked
up quite a few new culinary ideas.

15:05.152 --> 15:08.085
<i>And there's a fish I rather
fancy, made with miso.</i>

15:09.556 --> 15:11.555
I see you haven't changed
at all, old friend.

15:11.557 --> 15:14.759
I can't wait to taste this fish
dish you've been talking about.

15:14.761 --> 15:17.597
Didn't mean to brag, sir,
but it is quite good.

15:18.298 --> 15:19.667
I'm sure it is.

15:22.202 --> 15:23.403
Get down!

15:25.172 --> 15:26.374
Fire!

15:29.110 --> 15:31.278
A direct hit!
We got him.

15:37.118 --> 15:39.117
- Huh? What is that?
- Bail out.

15:39.119 --> 15:41.118
I'm going
after the Joker.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.656
Selena, take care
of Alfred for me.

15:43.658 --> 15:44.658
You got it.

16:05.578 --> 16:07.314
Batman's comin'!

16:08.416 --> 16:10.181
- What's that?
- Batman's here

16:10.183 --> 16:11.618
in his Batmobile!

16:15.956 --> 16:19.858
Take aim! Fire!

16:19.860 --> 16:22.761
<i>He's beaten
the gunmen and our cannons.</i>

16:22.763 --> 16:24.396
And he's
rapidly approaching

16:24.398 --> 16:27.131
as this fun
puppet show demonstrates.

16:29.135 --> 16:31.802
He's nothing without
his stupid Batmobile.

16:31.804 --> 16:34.341
Which gives me
an interesting idea.

16:39.179 --> 16:40.380
Nice try.

16:43.950 --> 16:47.551
Oh, Batman. The old
magnetized bumper trick.

16:47.553 --> 16:50.254
Always so clever
with your technology.

16:50.256 --> 16:53.157
Harley, activate
Arkham Castle!

16:53.159 --> 16:56.326
But, puddin', the castle
isn't even finished yet.

16:56.328 --> 16:57.930
But this is
the Batman!

16:57.932 --> 17:01.099
He's the reason we made
it in the first place.

17:01.101 --> 17:02.602
Right.

17:10.443 --> 17:12.878
Get ready, Joker.

17:34.233 --> 17:36.569
What the hell
is that?

17:37.471 --> 17:39.003
This is madness.

17:41.974 --> 17:45.110
<i>How about a pitcher?
Not a belly itcher.</i>

17:45.112 --> 17:48.513
<i>Now we need a batter,
not a broken ladder.</i>

17:48.515 --> 17:52.084
Swing batter.

17:52.086 --> 17:53.086
Incoming.

17:58.424 --> 18:00.060
Now, it's my turn.

18:05.665 --> 18:07.732
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

18:07.734 --> 18:09.867
Ooh, storming the gate.

18:09.869 --> 18:12.405
<i>Let me give you
a helping hand.</i>

18:15.275 --> 18:20.178
<i>Now I'll crush your favorite
toy with you inside it.</i>

18:20.180 --> 18:21.414
Not today.

18:31.192 --> 18:34.124
Very persistent,
my old friend.

18:34.126 --> 18:35.593
<i>Locked on target.</i>

18:35.595 --> 18:37.429
<i>You know what
I like best about you?</i>

18:37.431 --> 18:39.366
<i>You're so predictable.</i>

18:44.070 --> 18:47.405
Bat on a stick, one of
my favorite delicacies.

18:47.407 --> 18:48.875
Not so fast.

19:07.126 --> 19:09.361
It's over, Joker.
You're through.

19:09.363 --> 19:12.963
No, I don't think you have
that completely right.

19:12.965 --> 19:14.067
Hmm?

19:20.507 --> 19:22.407
How terrible!

19:22.409 --> 19:26.178
You can come after me, or save
that mother and child down below.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.480
Your move, Bats!

19:27.881 --> 19:28.883
No!

19:55.575 --> 19:57.174
Bane? How did you...

20:28.241 --> 20:30.543
This isn't
your fight!

20:40.053 --> 20:41.255
Go! Hurry!

20:43.089 --> 20:44.657
Need more power.

20:48.494 --> 20:49.863
Wait! No!

20:59.673 --> 21:02.172
Get moving,
I'll hold them off.

21:02.174 --> 21:04.010
Hold this!

21:12.986 --> 21:16.821
Poor Bats. He always
falls for the same tricks.

21:16.823 --> 21:19.924
Oh, it makes me sad
he's so dumb.

21:19.926 --> 21:23.128
He's always risking his life
to save ordinary people.

21:23.130 --> 21:25.697
If you had just let them die
and gone after me instead,

21:25.699 --> 21:29.867
maybe you wouldn't find yourself
in such terrible shape.

21:29.869 --> 21:31.803
I have no regrets.

21:31.805 --> 21:33.904
Well, what shall
we do now?

21:33.906 --> 21:35.373
Are you just
going to lie there,

21:35.375 --> 21:37.307
or are you going to
entertain me some more?

21:37.309 --> 21:41.113
I'm not here for
your entertainment.

21:41.115 --> 21:43.113
Ah, wrong again.

21:43.115 --> 21:45.216
Now that all your toys
are busted

21:45.218 --> 21:47.986
you better start thinking what
you're going to do for a second act.

21:47.988 --> 21:51.590
Oh, if only your friends were
around to come by and say hi.

21:51.592 --> 21:54.057
Uh, puddin', look!

21:54.059 --> 21:55.061
Huh?

21:59.098 --> 22:02.833
I didn't mean it!
I was being sarcastic!

22:07.673 --> 22:10.109
<i>What? Ninja Batmen?</i>

22:12.979 --> 22:14.978
We got you.

22:14.980 --> 22:15.950
Huh?

22:37.136 --> 22:38.969
Nightwing, Red Robin,

22:38.971 --> 22:40.740
who else made the time jump?

22:41.907 --> 22:43.441
Red Hood
and Robin, too.

22:43.443 --> 22:45.410
But Red Hood is away
on a recon mission

22:45.412 --> 22:47.981
to find out what's happening
in the other feudal states.

22:48.682 --> 22:50.381
Alfred and Catwoman?

22:50.383 --> 22:51.582
Don't worry.

22:51.584 --> 22:53.183
Robin has already
gone after them.

22:53.185 --> 22:54.721
They should be
here shortly.

22:56.189 --> 22:57.191
And him?

22:57.923 --> 22:59.891
Batman, this
is Aeon.

22:59.893 --> 23:02.093
He was a great help to us
after we arrived here.

23:02.095 --> 23:04.629
<i>He's the leader of
the ninja clan.</i>

23:04.631 --> 23:06.597
<i>Ninja clan?</i>

23:06.599 --> 23:08.900
We are the Bat clan
of Hida.

23:08.902 --> 23:11.904
Our lives are guided by
an ancient prophecy.

23:21.515 --> 23:25.350
<i>Legend foretells that
when the country is in chaos</i>

23:25.352 --> 23:29.086
<i>a foreign ninja wearing
the mask of a bat will come</i>

23:29.088 --> 23:31.488
<i>and restore order to our land.</i>

23:31.490 --> 23:35.693
<i>Bat clan, we have waited
all our lives for this moment.</i>

23:35.695 --> 23:37.996
<i>Serve this shinobi
with your life.</i>

23:37.998 --> 23:41.701
<i>This is the hour
of our destiny.</i>

23:48.442 --> 23:50.808
Now, we finally look upon you,

23:50.810 --> 23:53.545
great shinobi from
across the sea of time.

23:53.547 --> 23:55.149
Lord Batman.

23:56.082 --> 23:57.084
Hmm.

24:30.083 --> 24:31.882
Looks like
a nice place.

24:31.884 --> 24:34.286
Yes, but for
how long.

24:34.288 --> 24:37.689
The Batmobile,
the Batwing, the Batcycle

24:37.691 --> 24:42.026
they've all been destroyed
at the hands of the Joker.

24:42.028 --> 24:45.899
How do we regain the advantage
when we have nothing?

24:49.301 --> 24:50.401
Batman.

24:50.403 --> 24:52.203
Monkichi has
a message for you.

24:52.205 --> 24:53.771
Monkichi?

24:53.773 --> 24:55.672
It's weird, but Robin's
made friends with this monkey.

24:55.674 --> 24:57.107
He's really
pretty smart.

24:57.109 --> 24:59.442
And he understands
everything I say.

25:01.047 --> 25:02.447
<i>What is it?</i>

25:02.449 --> 25:04.951
He says he got it from
someone in the mountain.

25:06.786 --> 25:08.355
It's in English.

25:10.423 --> 25:11.759
It's Grodd.

25:47.660 --> 25:50.361
Oh, that feels good.

25:50.363 --> 25:52.529
What is it about
apes and humans

25:52.531 --> 25:58.303
that we always sigh when we
relax in a hot bath, Batman?

25:58.305 --> 26:01.805
<i>You might as well
enjoy the waters, too.</i>

26:01.807 --> 26:04.475
No, I'm good right here.

26:04.477 --> 26:06.844
I never would have taken
you for the shy type,

26:06.846 --> 26:10.314
but then again you are always
hiding behind the mask.

26:10.316 --> 26:13.284
Are you sure you don't
want to reconsider?

26:15.520 --> 26:17.154
<i>I'm guessing
you didn't invite me here</i>

26:17.156 --> 26:19.757
<i>just to join you
for a hot soak.</i>

26:19.759 --> 26:21.992
Such impatience.

26:21.994 --> 26:23.527
Well, what did
you expect?

26:23.529 --> 26:26.363
We're only in this mess
because of you, Grodd.

26:26.365 --> 26:29.700
Why did you invent that time
machine in the first place?

26:29.702 --> 26:33.638
That's like asking why this
ancient Gorilla crossed the road.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.172
Because I could.

26:35.174 --> 26:39.943
The criminals of Gotham
were my guinea pigs.

26:39.945 --> 26:45.815
I was going to send them some place far
away, so I could take over Gotham myself.

26:45.817 --> 26:47.384
And I would've succeeded.

26:47.386 --> 26:49.821
<i>The Quake Engine was
my greatest invention.</i>

26:49.823 --> 26:53.057
<i>But your interference brought
us to this time and place.</i>

26:53.059 --> 26:55.058
<i>How's that?</i>

26:55.060 --> 26:57.396
We are both responsible
for what transpired that night.

26:58.731 --> 27:02.366
And we will need to
cooperate to get home.

27:02.368 --> 27:04.602
What do
you say, Batman?

27:04.604 --> 27:05.969
I'll be the bait.

27:05.971 --> 27:08.573
It's the best way
to draw out the Joker.

27:08.575 --> 27:11.010
<i>Hmm. Intriguing.</i>

27:40.373 --> 27:43.975
Well, it's been a while,
my dear Gorilla Grodd.

27:43.977 --> 27:46.411
Looks like this place
agrees with you.

27:46.413 --> 27:50.280
Hmm. Well well, I know
this isn't just a social visit.

27:50.282 --> 27:52.382
Where's Batman?

27:52.384 --> 27:54.751
Clearly you've no time for pleasantries
now that you've set on conquest.

27:54.753 --> 27:58.288
Ooh, is it that obvious?
It's the outfit, isn't it?

27:58.290 --> 27:59.724
Kinda gives it away.

27:59.726 --> 28:02.760
Imagine this entire country
in total chaos.

28:02.762 --> 28:07.163
A land full of
needless suffering and pain.

28:07.165 --> 28:09.467
It's very interesting
that of all humans,

28:09.469 --> 28:11.835
you're the one who wound up
with the Quake Engine.

28:11.837 --> 28:14.671
Oh, I'm tired of
all this chit-chat, Grodd.

28:14.673 --> 28:18.209
I told you I'd spare your life
in exchange for the Batman.

28:18.211 --> 28:19.910
So where is he?

28:19.912 --> 28:21.114
Huh?

28:23.115 --> 28:24.317
Right here.

28:29.422 --> 28:31.956
We have you
surrounded, Joker.

28:33.026 --> 28:34.327
You sure do.

28:49.542 --> 28:50.543
Catch!

28:53.378 --> 28:54.577
No!

28:54.579 --> 28:56.747
Well, duh!
What do you take us for?

28:56.749 --> 28:59.383
We knew you'd have men
hiding in the water.

28:59.385 --> 29:02.085
It's a shame
they all had to die.

29:02.087 --> 29:04.457
So why don't
you join them?

29:07.594 --> 29:09.028
Maybe another time.

29:18.304 --> 29:20.740
You're still doomed.

29:27.713 --> 29:31.117
You underestimate
your opponent, Joker.

29:32.184 --> 29:34.451
Just like you
always do.

29:34.453 --> 29:37.124
But how?
We killed you.

29:39.825 --> 29:41.595
Ever heard of a decoy?

29:58.478 --> 29:59.479
Oh.

30:24.002 --> 30:28.305
Sheesh. I never figured you'd
side with Batman, Gorilla Grodd.

30:28.307 --> 30:30.644
Anything to gain
the advantage.

31:19.792 --> 31:21.624
I never thought
you'd need help

31:21.626 --> 31:23.626
from a talking monkey
to catch me.

31:23.628 --> 31:26.430
I'm so embarrassed
for you, Batman.

31:26.432 --> 31:29.266
Don't be. I'm happy
to disappoint.

31:29.268 --> 31:34.271
Oh, I'd be careful. If he turned
on me, he'll turn on you.

31:37.376 --> 31:40.844
I'm so grateful we were
able to trust each other.

31:40.846 --> 31:42.246
Many thanks.

31:42.248 --> 31:45.583
But in this world,
trust means nothing.

31:45.585 --> 31:49.319
Now you will
submit to my control.

31:49.321 --> 31:52.391
Bat clan,
destroy them all.

31:57.497 --> 31:59.896
We cannot be shaken
by your evil thoughts.

31:59.898 --> 32:03.734
We have mastery over our
bodies and our minds.

32:03.736 --> 32:05.268
So you do.

32:05.270 --> 32:07.673
Then prepare
to be annihilated.

32:19.752 --> 32:20.753
Over there!

32:26.992 --> 32:28.726
<i>Two-face.</i>

32:28.728 --> 32:32.261
You and Two-Face have
teamed up, Gorilla Grodd?

32:32.263 --> 32:33.732
That's right,
Red Robin.

32:36.236 --> 32:40.373
Don't you know Gorilla Grodd
is always two steps ahead?

32:46.112 --> 32:47.346
No!

32:50.583 --> 32:53.954
And to what do I owe this
unexpected visit, Catwoman?

32:56.522 --> 32:59.590
Oh, I thought you might
want this thingy.

32:59.592 --> 33:02.159
Now where did
you get that?

33:02.161 --> 33:05.263
I lifted it from Harley
Quinn during our fight.

33:05.265 --> 33:09.333
It's part of your
fancy quake machine, isn't it?

33:09.335 --> 33:11.736
And what do you
want in return?

33:11.738 --> 33:14.338
Take me back
to the future.

33:14.340 --> 33:17.708
It's a deal.

33:17.710 --> 33:20.313
I thought we could
do business.

33:25.751 --> 33:27.519
We have to
abandon ship.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.555
Now!

33:31.825 --> 33:33.090
Joker?

33:33.092 --> 33:35.426
Looking for me, Bats?

33:38.397 --> 33:40.697
Don't do it, Joker.

33:40.699 --> 33:43.601
We need to go! She can't
stay afloat much longer.

33:43.603 --> 33:45.369
Take the others, go!

33:45.371 --> 33:46.937
What about you?

33:46.939 --> 33:48.439
I'm staying. He's
not getting away.

33:48.441 --> 33:50.842
Oh, I'm really
flattered, Batman.

33:50.844 --> 33:53.376
We really don't spend
enough time together.

33:53.378 --> 33:55.345
We're just so busy.

33:55.347 --> 33:59.482
To be honest, if Two-Face had killed
you, I'd never forgive myself.

33:59.484 --> 34:01.585
I deserve to
kill the Batman.

34:01.587 --> 34:03.019
<i>I'm the Joker.</i>

34:03.021 --> 34:04.889
You're insane.
You'll kill yourself.

34:04.891 --> 34:06.323
Ugh! That's what
I've been trying

34:06.325 --> 34:08.359
to tell you,
you stupid bat.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.994
I'm having a party,
in hell!

34:13.231 --> 34:14.434
<i>Joker, no!</i>

34:17.003 --> 34:19.639
No!

34:28.213 --> 34:30.983
Hmm. And so it ends.

35:03.849 --> 35:04.851
Hmm.

35:18.230 --> 35:19.432
Hmm.

35:31.876 --> 35:33.677
Mmm.

35:33.679 --> 35:36.146
The renovations are
almost complete.

35:36.148 --> 35:37.780
Contact the other daimyos.

35:37.782 --> 35:40.450
The battle will be at
Jigokukohara, the field of hell.

35:40.452 --> 35:42.155
We'll see
who'll be shogun.

35:44.389 --> 35:46.990
<i>And when will
we be going home?</i>

35:46.992 --> 35:49.092
Now, soon enough.

35:49.094 --> 35:52.762
<i>We still need to obtain three
remaining power converters</i>

35:52.764 --> 35:55.166
<i>from Penguin, Poison Ivy,
and Deathstroke.</i>

35:55.168 --> 35:59.769
<i>Then the Quake Engine will be complete
and we can move through time and space.</i>

35:59.771 --> 36:02.442
<i>Excuse me, do you mind
stepping aside?</i>

36:04.577 --> 36:07.110
Isn't eating a banana
a little cliche?

36:07.112 --> 36:10.083
Says the cat burglar
in the cat costume.

36:32.570 --> 36:35.873
We're relieved you're
with us, Master Bruce.

36:35.875 --> 36:38.041
How long have
I been out?

36:38.043 --> 36:39.445
Two whole days, sir.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.681
I see.

36:43.748 --> 36:45.215
<i>Well, what is this?</i>

36:45.217 --> 36:47.351
Aeon brought it by, sir.

36:47.353 --> 36:50.753
<i>He said the legendary mask
of the Bat clan</i>

36:50.755 --> 36:53.659
<i>should be worn by
its rightful owner.</i>

37:18.083 --> 37:19.650
I had nothing.

37:19.652 --> 37:21.653
No vehicles
or weapons.

37:23.155 --> 37:26.088
I didn't know
who I was anymore.

37:26.090 --> 37:29.161
Who was Batman, stripped
of all his technology?

37:30.797 --> 37:34.067
In my desperation, I
joined forces with Grodd.

37:35.833 --> 37:39.436
So many lost and injured
because I was blind

37:39.438 --> 37:42.541
to Grodd's betrayal,
but ultimately to myself.

37:43.909 --> 37:47.644
And yet they still insist
on calling me Master.

37:47.646 --> 37:49.380
So what are
you gonna do?

37:49.382 --> 37:50.748
Just hang it up?

37:50.750 --> 37:53.650
What I always do,
I'm going to fight.

37:53.652 --> 37:55.586
I was wrong.

37:55.588 --> 37:57.153
I thought
I had nothing.

37:57.155 --> 37:59.222
But I have more
than I thought.

37:59.224 --> 38:03.295
I have my mind,
my body, my spirit...

38:07.065 --> 38:08.166
and all of you.

38:09.101 --> 38:11.037
That's more
than enough.

38:18.409 --> 38:21.412
<i>This time and place
has its own rules.</i>

38:21.414 --> 38:25.118
And if we're going to win,
it's time we played by them.

38:26.251 --> 38:27.584
I swear

38:27.586 --> 38:29.688
their faith in me
will not be squandered.

38:31.824 --> 38:34.092
<i>We will master
the ways of the ninja.</i>

38:35.460 --> 38:39.530
Our weapons will be
everything that exists.

38:39.532 --> 38:42.398
And I will turn
their legend

38:42.400 --> 38:44.036
<i>into reality.</i>

38:50.742 --> 38:53.476
<i>The techniques of the
ninja are extremely effective.</i>

38:53.478 --> 38:55.412
<i>If we can combine
their martial arts skills</i>

38:55.414 --> 38:57.414
<i>with modern innovations
and combat,</i>

38:57.416 --> 38:59.615
<i>Grodd won't know what hit him.</i>

38:59.617 --> 39:01.985
<i>If they attack us with their mobile
fortress, we will out-maneuver them</i>

39:01.987 --> 39:04.588
<i>and strike back with
everything we've got.</i>

39:04.590 --> 39:06.657
<i>Will it work?</i>

39:06.659 --> 39:09.059
<i>The craftsmanship of the
ninja blacksmiths is incredible.</i>

39:09.061 --> 39:13.162
<i>The precision of their weapons can't be
matched even by our 21st century standards.</i>

39:15.733 --> 39:18.802
<i>The wild game and
produce here are exceptional.</i>

39:18.804 --> 39:20.537
<i>I'm planning
a high protein diet.</i>

39:20.539 --> 39:23.507
<i>Perhaps some boar steak
for dinner tonight, sir?</i>

39:23.509 --> 39:25.708
<i>Sounds good, Alfred.</i>

39:25.710 --> 39:28.479
<i>When the wheat is ready for harvest,
we can make some freshly baked bread.</i>

39:28.481 --> 39:31.081
<i>Well, you know what they say,</i>

39:31.083 --> 39:33.416
<i>wars are won on full stomachs.</i>

39:33.418 --> 39:35.452
- <i>Good thinking.</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

39:35.454 --> 39:37.320
<i>Batman, Monkichi
has another message.</i>

39:37.322 --> 39:38.956
<i>Has Red Hood
found them?</i>

39:38.958 --> 39:40.360
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>I'm on my way.</i>

40:18.931 --> 40:20.162
Excuse me.

40:20.164 --> 40:22.932
May I have
a cup of water, please?

40:22.934 --> 40:25.237
Ah, yes, of course.

40:27.106 --> 40:30.076
Oh,
you must be exhausted.

40:34.512 --> 40:38.782
It's a rather hot day for a
Buddhist monk to be traveling.

40:44.690 --> 40:45.992
I'll break it.

40:49.461 --> 40:51.695
Stop! Please stop!

40:51.697 --> 40:54.367
If you don't show
your face, I'll break her arm.

40:56.335 --> 40:58.434
Okay, okay, okay.

40:58.436 --> 41:00.706
<i>I knew
you were alive, Joker.</i>

41:04.576 --> 41:08.644
They said you were dead,
but I didn't believe it.

41:08.646 --> 41:10.882
So I've been
looking for you.

41:11.349 --> 41:12.816
Joker?

41:12.818 --> 41:15.351
Why do you keep insisting
on calling me that?

41:15.353 --> 41:17.487
Admit it!

41:17.489 --> 41:20.391
No! No! My darling!

41:20.393 --> 41:23.262
No, no, are you insane?

41:24.230 --> 41:26.796
You think
I'm that stupid?

41:26.798 --> 41:28.731
Do you expect me
to believe

41:28.733 --> 41:31.001
the Joker has
taken up farming?

41:31.003 --> 41:32.836
Honey?

41:32.838 --> 41:35.572
You too!
Harley Quinn!

41:35.574 --> 41:38.110
Oh, my love.
Oh, my love.

41:38.943 --> 41:40.476
I owe you this.

41:40.478 --> 41:43.679
<i>Please forgive us.
Please. Please.</i>

41:56.594 --> 41:58.896
I don't understand.

41:58.898 --> 42:01.130
I'm not
who you think I am.

42:01.132 --> 42:03.535
If you're still
going to deny it...

42:21.753 --> 42:24.487
<i>Red Hood, stop it!</i>

42:24.489 --> 42:28.458
<i>Batman, what
are you doing here?</i>

42:28.460 --> 42:31.128
<i>Same as you.</i>

42:31.130 --> 42:33.729
I heard that you had found
the Joker and Harley.

42:33.731 --> 42:37.469
Reports of foreign farmers in the
area match their description.

42:50.581 --> 42:53.349
<i>So, you don't
remember anything?</i>

42:53.351 --> 42:55.219
<i>No.</i>

42:55.221 --> 42:58.320
We can't remember
anything about our past.

42:58.322 --> 43:02.258
We came here to live a peaceful
life, deep in the mountains.

43:02.260 --> 43:05.864
My wife and I, we plough
the fields together.

43:07.699 --> 43:09.231
<i>I see.</i>

43:09.233 --> 43:11.034
Don't let
'em fool you, Batman.

43:11.036 --> 43:13.369
They're up to their
same old tricks.

43:13.371 --> 43:15.473
I'm not so sure,
Red Hood.

43:17.576 --> 43:20.278
<i>I'm sorry
for my friend's behavior.</i>

43:29.989 --> 43:33.889
When I work the land,
I feel like I'm being cleansed.

43:33.891 --> 43:37.526
It's as if everything bad
inside me is being sucked out

43:37.528 --> 43:39.496
and absorbed back
into the earth.

43:39.498 --> 43:42.833
I know it sounds silly, but my
wife and I are always saying

43:42.835 --> 43:44.603
it's like
we've been reborn.

43:46.038 --> 43:49.838
<i>Honey, quick!
Come, look!</i>

43:49.840 --> 43:53.112
<i>There's a sprout.
You have to see this.</i>

43:53.878 --> 43:55.012
<i>New life...</i>

43:55.014 --> 43:56.912
A sprout,
are you kidding?

43:56.914 --> 43:58.648
Enough!

43:58.650 --> 44:01.985
This is different. I've been
tricked by them before.

44:01.987 --> 44:04.655
<i>There isn't the same
madness in his eyes.</i>

44:04.657 --> 44:08.992
<i>If you knew him like I did, you'd know he
could never hide that part of himself.</i>

44:08.994 --> 44:11.360
<i>It's what makes him what he is.</i>

44:23.974 --> 44:26.208
Oh, honey.

44:28.112 --> 44:31.182
We did it.
They're finally growing.

44:33.885 --> 44:35.751
Bruce...

44:35.753 --> 44:39.155
He's not the Joker.
At least, not anymore.

44:39.157 --> 44:41.624
They both lost their
memories in the explosion.

44:41.626 --> 44:43.260
There's no need
to bother them.

44:43.262 --> 44:44.662
You can't
be serious.

44:44.664 --> 44:46.295
<i>We'll take them
back with us</i>

44:46.297 --> 44:49.166
once the Quake Engine
is operational again.

44:49.168 --> 44:52.469
But, for now we'll just
keep an eye on them.

44:52.471 --> 44:54.373
<i>They're not
going to hurt anyone.</i>

44:57.443 --> 44:59.679
<i>Come on,
Red Hood, let's go.</i>

45:02.146 --> 45:04.016
I hope
you're right.

45:43.922 --> 45:46.055
Construction's complete.

45:46.057 --> 45:51.530
The time has arrived to destroy these
upstarts and rebuild the Quake Engine.

45:52.797 --> 45:55.433
Arkham Castle, rise!

46:31.702 --> 46:35.003
That malicious monkey
is finally on the move.

46:35.005 --> 46:39.411
Let's take what's ours and
feather this nest we've built.

46:41.447 --> 46:45.115
Fly! Trojan Birdman Castle.

46:45.117 --> 46:47.450
Spread your wings!

46:47.452 --> 46:50.854
I will not let
this paradise be destroyed

46:50.856 --> 46:53.190
by the machinations of men.

46:53.192 --> 46:56.159
Juroku Plant Poison Castle.

46:56.161 --> 46:59.597
Grow. And let them reap
what we have sown.

47:01.833 --> 47:03.833
<i>Interesting.</i>

47:03.835 --> 47:07.604
Now we'll finally see who's the
most powerful warlord in Japan.

47:07.606 --> 47:12.008
Gakuju Sharaso Castle will blow
you all to kingdom come.

47:12.010 --> 47:13.211
Fire!

47:14.980 --> 47:18.916
From order to chaos.
All in the flip of a coin.

47:18.918 --> 47:21.717
The enemy converges
at the field of hell.

47:21.719 --> 47:26.391
<i>Fudo Omote Two-Face castle will meet
them, and decide the fate of Japan.</i>

47:48.780 --> 47:50.449
A fine tea, Alfred.

47:51.317 --> 47:52.518
My pleasure.

47:53.851 --> 47:56.318
All of the daimyo castles
are on the move.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.523
This is our chance.

47:58.856 --> 48:03.025
I can't wait to
slaughter them all.

48:03.027 --> 48:06.598
Then it will truly earn the
name "The field of hell."

48:07.965 --> 48:09.733
But what matters is

48:09.735 --> 48:11.836
the converters and the Quake
Engine will all be in one place.

48:13.304 --> 48:15.204
This is it.

48:15.206 --> 48:17.407
This is our
one opportunity

48:17.409 --> 48:20.146
to defeat them
and return to Gotham.

48:22.047 --> 48:25.514
<i>Remember, the machines,
no matter how large,</i>

48:25.516 --> 48:27.818
are still controlled
by humans.

48:27.820 --> 48:30.686
If we can defeat the person
inside the machine,

48:30.688 --> 48:32.458
then we have
a fighting chance.

48:33.190 --> 48:34.757
<i>Aeon was right.</i>

48:34.759 --> 48:37.661
<i>I now understand the role
I must play.</i>

48:37.663 --> 48:40.329
I am not longer the Batman.

48:40.331 --> 48:43.266
I will be what the Bat clan
calls me.

48:43.268 --> 48:45.367
<i>I will be their prophecy.</i>

48:45.369 --> 48:49.972
<i>I will be the legendary ninja who
will bring peace to their land.</i>

48:49.974 --> 48:51.277
<i>I will be...</i>

49:10.896 --> 49:11.897
<i>Fire!</i>

49:18.202 --> 49:22.137
This Penguin moves as swiftly
on land as it does at sea!

49:22.139 --> 49:25.340
<i>And it's got
one hell of a bite.</i>

49:25.342 --> 49:29.313
Watch it, you bloated bird,
'cause this plant bites back.

49:29.315 --> 49:32.182
And I'm going to catch you
in this flytrap.

49:35.554 --> 49:37.920
<i>Trojan Birdman Castle,</i>

49:37.922 --> 49:43.159
<i>wind forest fire
mountain transformation.</i>

49:43.161 --> 49:45.293
Two can play
at this game.

49:45.295 --> 49:47.563
<i>Juroku Plant Poison Castle,</i>

49:47.565 --> 49:50.768
<i>multitudes of
flowers transformation.</i>

49:56.641 --> 49:58.508
Bullseye.

49:58.510 --> 50:00.744
<i>Gakuju Sharaso Castle,</i>

50:00.746 --> 50:03.813
<i>rapid fire
hundred cannons transformation.</i>

50:03.815 --> 50:05.248
<i>Fire!</i>

50:19.231 --> 50:20.699
Not too bad.

50:21.166 --> 50:22.699
Hmph.

50:22.701 --> 50:23.702
Hmm?

50:32.610 --> 50:35.947
Gorilla Grodd,
leave him to me.

50:40.318 --> 50:42.284
<i>Fudo Omote Two-Face Castle,</i>

50:42.286 --> 50:45.623
<i>two-faced transformation!</i>

50:50.795 --> 50:52.262
Look! Over there.

50:52.264 --> 50:53.999
Giant robots?

51:07.112 --> 51:09.177
Batman, what now?

51:09.179 --> 51:12.148
Master, leave them to us.

51:12.150 --> 51:13.385
Give 'em hell!

51:17.422 --> 51:19.488
Behind us.

51:19.490 --> 51:21.893
We're stuck between a rock
and a hard place.

51:34.005 --> 51:35.070
Come on.

51:49.855 --> 51:51.554
Yeah.

51:51.556 --> 51:54.456
I appreciate your
loyalty, Two-Face.

51:54.458 --> 51:57.895
Sure. Until the coin
tells me otherwise.

52:02.201 --> 52:05.101
Tails, I stay.
Heads, I go.

52:05.103 --> 52:06.805
Your luck's run out.

52:08.606 --> 52:12.010
I'm gonna rip you
limb from limb, Grodd.

52:14.913 --> 52:18.947
It's easy to understand
the laws of probability.

52:19.952 --> 52:22.054
It was only
a matter of time.

52:24.322 --> 52:25.524
Let's go!

52:32.463 --> 52:34.565
Head straight for
Arkham Castle!

52:41.239 --> 52:42.440
Look out!

52:55.219 --> 52:56.754
Well, that was cool.

53:18.309 --> 53:20.909
<i>That's
enough games for now.</i>

53:20.911 --> 53:24.882
It's time to
get down to business.

54:04.655 --> 54:06.289
What are you doing now?

54:06.291 --> 54:11.096
All of Gotham's criminals
are now under my mind control.

54:13.764 --> 54:15.731
<i>What they do not know</i>

54:15.733 --> 54:19.901
is that I actually manipulated them
into building their fortresses, too.

54:19.903 --> 54:22.003
<i>Where do you think
they got the technology?</i>

54:22.005 --> 54:24.874
They are just pieces
in a larger puzzle.

54:24.876 --> 54:29.045
<i>Like the feudal states
of Japan herself.</i>

54:29.047 --> 54:31.347
Whatever it takes
to get home.

54:31.349 --> 54:33.251
Sorry to break it
to you...

54:35.019 --> 54:37.686
but you're not going anywhere.

54:37.688 --> 54:40.690
I'm going to rule
this country

54:40.692 --> 54:43.959
and turn it into
a kingdom of monkeys,

54:43.961 --> 54:46.595
<i>and rewrite the history
of the world!</i>

55:00.143 --> 55:01.879
What is...

55:24.101 --> 55:25.237
We're back!

55:26.304 --> 55:28.037
I love giving presents.

55:28.039 --> 55:30.940
Out with the old
and in with the new.

55:30.942 --> 55:33.409
No exchanges or returns.

55:35.681 --> 55:36.746
Joker?

55:36.748 --> 55:38.213
It can't be.

55:38.215 --> 55:39.849
Hi, Bats.

55:39.851 --> 55:43.722
You should know by now that you
can't keep a crazy man down.

55:51.996 --> 55:55.264
You never want to be
too early to a party.

55:55.266 --> 55:56.331
Right?

55:59.536 --> 56:02.237
Hi, pretty kitty.

56:02.239 --> 56:06.208
You really took us by surprise
back at the lake, Grodd.

56:06.210 --> 56:08.911
But now it's time
for a little payback.

56:08.913 --> 56:13.182
The paralysis isn't permanent, but we're
thinking about increasing the dosage.

56:13.184 --> 56:15.687
Ivy's got the best plants,
don't you think?

56:16.454 --> 56:17.787
Bastard.

56:17.789 --> 56:18.954
Now, now, now,

56:18.956 --> 56:20.722
don't go
and strain yourself.

56:20.724 --> 56:22.624
Not that you
can move anyway.

56:22.626 --> 56:24.329
You too, kitty cat.

56:27.565 --> 56:32.034
Now, in a dramatic turn of events,
the Joker takes over Grodd's plan.

56:32.036 --> 56:33.137
Sayonara!

56:40.110 --> 56:41.112
Batman!

57:02.567 --> 57:04.633
It's so tough being a hero.

57:16.047 --> 57:18.481
Are both of you all right?

57:18.483 --> 57:22.017
Don't think I didn't notice you
saving Grodd before me.

57:22.019 --> 57:25.021
But, thank you, Batman.

57:25.023 --> 57:27.889
I see that gas didn't
knock out your attitude.

57:27.891 --> 57:29.960
I'm glad you're
still with us, Catwoman.

57:33.998 --> 57:38.499
So what now, puddin'? It looks like this
thing is still plugged into their brains.

57:38.501 --> 57:42.708
Well, that means it's time
to play a few mind games.

57:46.010 --> 57:48.146
Criminals of Gotham,

57:49.579 --> 57:52.851
<i>become one!</i>

58:41.264 --> 58:46.802
Five unite and serve
as six heavenly beings.

58:46.804 --> 58:49.539
Lord Joker!

59:00.050 --> 59:03.519
Whoa! That thing's enormous.

59:03.521 --> 59:08.624
This contraption is better than
I ever imagined, Gorilla Grodd.

59:08.626 --> 59:11.827
This country really
will belong the Joker.

59:11.829 --> 59:13.429
Now let's see.

59:13.431 --> 59:16.697
What sort of chaos the
super robot can unleash.

59:23.273 --> 59:25.309
Hurry, get out of here.

59:41.525 --> 59:42.860
Robin, get...

59:45.362 --> 59:46.364
Robin!

59:54.539 --> 59:56.074
<i>Gorilla Grodd?</i>

59:58.242 --> 01:00:01.278
<i>Ooh, that was easy.
Now what?</i>

01:00:09.619 --> 01:00:11.422
Guess I could use a nap.

01:00:14.925 --> 01:00:16.358
So what now?

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.992
He's hurt
pretty bad.

01:00:20.364 --> 01:00:21.365
Here.

01:00:24.135 --> 01:00:26.071
You can use this.

01:00:29.873 --> 01:00:32.443
It controls my
army of monkeys.

01:00:34.311 --> 01:00:36.914
Use them to
defeat the Joker.

01:00:40.284 --> 01:00:43.619
I owe you
for saving my life.

01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:47.592
<i>I promise,
no tricks this time.</i>

01:00:53.231 --> 01:00:56.699
Batman, lend us
the flute, please?

01:00:56.701 --> 01:00:59.168
Monkichi and I know exactly
what to do.

01:01:14.786 --> 01:01:16.385
What?

01:01:16.387 --> 01:01:18.354
<i>Monkeys?</i>

01:01:26.797 --> 01:01:28.198
There's millions.

01:01:44.581 --> 01:01:48.650
I can feel them. They're
crawling all over me.

01:01:48.652 --> 01:01:51.322
<i>Get off! Get off!</i>

01:01:54.157 --> 01:01:55.224
They can't hang on.

01:01:57.195 --> 01:01:58.526
Monmi.

01:01:58.528 --> 01:02:00.729
Who's she?

01:02:00.731 --> 01:02:01.733
You got it.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.668
So annoying!

01:02:33.664 --> 01:02:37.168
If the bad guys are
going to unite, then so will we.

01:02:38.168 --> 01:02:40.202
Enough monking around!

01:02:40.204 --> 01:02:42.340
<i>I'll blow you to pieces.</i>

01:02:54.518 --> 01:02:57.519
<i>All for one
and one for all.</i>

01:02:57.521 --> 01:03:00.623
Their combined spirit
has formed this giant samurai.

01:03:00.625 --> 01:03:03.691
Now, witness the awesome
power of the monkeys.

01:03:03.693 --> 01:03:07.664
<i>Together, they will deliver
a devastating blow!</i>

01:03:16.139 --> 01:03:17.873
Unexpected.

01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:19.141
Let's move!

01:03:19.143 --> 01:03:20.943
Storm the robot
while it's down.

01:03:20.945 --> 01:03:22.278
- Right!
- Monkichi,

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.579
I'm leaving
the flute with you.

01:03:25.248 --> 01:03:27.650
Bruce, I'm going
with you.

01:03:27.652 --> 01:03:30.355
Harley Quinn could use
a good ass kicking.

01:03:31.889 --> 01:03:33.655
Come on.

01:03:33.657 --> 01:03:36.425
Got to love a man who can forgive
a girl for double-crossing him.

01:03:38.061 --> 01:03:40.731
Monkey see monkey do.

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:51.273
<i>It's not how you fall, but how
you pick yourself up that counts.</i>

01:03:57.114 --> 01:03:58.316
All right.

01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:02.818
Looks like more
monkey business.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:05.287
Harley, we have guests!

01:04:06.623 --> 01:04:09.458
Why don't you greet them
with a warm kiss?

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.461
Sure!

01:04:19.503 --> 01:04:20.505
Get down!

01:04:42.726 --> 01:04:44.628
- Robin.
- No!

01:05:01.978 --> 01:05:04.348
Master, at your service.

01:05:10.353 --> 01:05:14.356
What, again? I hate bats!

01:05:14.358 --> 01:05:18.529
Go, go, go! Shoo, shoo! Get
out of here, you stupid bats!

01:05:19.028 --> 01:05:20.595
Go!

01:05:20.597 --> 01:05:21.798
Huh?

01:05:35.411 --> 01:05:38.482
Batman?

01:05:51.094 --> 01:05:53.897
Behold, the mighty Batgod
before us.

01:05:59.001 --> 01:06:00.936
Batman! Harley?

01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:05.510
Burn on the field of hell!

01:06:23.193 --> 01:06:24.395
We're coming for you.

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:09.670
Time to settle this...

01:07:09.672 --> 01:07:11.273
<i>once and for all.</i>

01:07:19.851 --> 01:07:21.952
Party's over, Penguin.

01:07:31.362 --> 01:07:34.295
Tell you what, Deathstroke,

01:07:34.297 --> 01:07:36.000
I'll give you
the first shot.

01:07:37.467 --> 01:07:39.803
I'm gonna wipe
that half-smile...

01:07:40.536 --> 01:07:43.037
right off your face.

01:07:43.039 --> 01:07:47.342
Poison Ivy, you know
you're not a real plant, right?

01:07:50.581 --> 01:07:53.514
I see you're back to
your old self again.

01:07:53.516 --> 01:07:57.087
I was convinced you'd
lost your memory, Joker.

01:07:57.922 --> 01:07:59.487
Yeah, about that.

01:07:59.489 --> 01:08:02.590
I had lost my memory.
I was a decent man.

01:08:04.128 --> 01:08:05.961
What a joke.

01:08:05.963 --> 01:08:08.162
But I had to do it!

01:08:08.164 --> 01:08:10.465
<i>It was the only way
I could get the upper hand.</i>

01:08:10.467 --> 01:08:15.503
I hypnotized myself to believe I was
someone else, so you would believe it.

01:08:15.505 --> 01:08:20.545
And this little flower was the
trigger to snap me back to insanity.

01:08:23.546 --> 01:08:25.180
<i>We did it!</i>

01:08:25.182 --> 01:08:26.814
<i>They're finally growing.</i>

01:08:37.028 --> 01:08:40.194
Harley, get ready.

01:08:40.197 --> 01:08:42.531
Can't wait, Mr. J.

01:08:55.912 --> 01:08:58.279
<i>See what happens
when you plant a seed</i>

01:08:58.282 --> 01:09:00.982
<i>and let it grow into
something beautiful?</i>

01:09:02.786 --> 01:09:05.754
<i>It's good to return to the
land, get your hands dirty.</i>

01:09:05.756 --> 01:09:08.490
<i>The French call it
"Nostalgie de la boue."</i>

01:09:08.492 --> 01:09:10.658
<i>Romance of the mud.</i>

01:09:10.661 --> 01:09:14.295
<i>You have to admit,
it was a great joke.</i>

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:23.971
<i>The only way to deceive you
was to deceive myself.</i>

01:09:23.974 --> 01:09:28.309
<i>And you fell for it
hook, line and flower.</i>

01:09:33.117 --> 01:09:34.616
Ha!

01:09:34.618 --> 01:09:37.453
The time has finally
come for you to die.

01:09:41.225 --> 01:09:42.527
Puddin', no!

01:09:49.131 --> 01:09:51.801
Time for some
girl-on-girl action.

01:10:23.768 --> 01:10:26.434
Careful, don't cut yourself.

01:10:26.436 --> 01:10:28.605
It's over, Ivy.
You lost.

01:10:48.192 --> 01:10:50.759
Take your medicine,
kitty-kitty,

01:10:50.761 --> 01:10:52.697
and say goodnight.

01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:36.206
Keep your tongue
to yourself.

01:11:54.926 --> 01:11:55.927
Bruce.

01:12:22.819 --> 01:12:25.187
What am I going to do
with you, Batman?

01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:29.191
You've destroyed a perfectly
good giant robot castle.

01:12:29.193 --> 01:12:32.326
You're going to have to
answer for that.

01:12:32.328 --> 01:12:35.796
Let's end this, Joker.
Just you and me.

01:12:35.798 --> 01:12:37.432
With pleasure.

01:12:37.434 --> 01:12:39.067
Oh, I'd hate to come all
the way to ancient Japan

01:12:39.069 --> 01:12:42.071
and miss out on
a samurai sword fight.

01:12:42.073 --> 01:12:44.071
Right, Bats?

01:12:44.073 --> 01:12:46.610
Then you
won't be disappointed.

01:12:56.252 --> 01:12:59.955
Not too bad. Making all
of my dreams come true.

01:12:59.957 --> 01:13:03.724
- Happy to help.
- Oh, don't tease.

01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:05.962
You're getting me excited.

01:13:08.765 --> 01:13:11.102
That was a good one.

01:13:15.805 --> 01:13:19.273
Oh, you can do
better than that.

01:13:19.275 --> 01:13:22.510
Maybe you need to hit the dojo
and get some more practice,

01:13:22.512 --> 01:13:24.215
work on your feint and parry.

01:13:27.283 --> 01:13:29.218
Ooh!

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.722
I'm going to cut you to ribbons, tie
you in a bow, and give you to myself!

01:13:35.492 --> 01:13:37.028
You're going to love it!

01:13:37.426 --> 01:13:38.826
Ooh!

01:13:38.828 --> 01:13:40.562
I really doubt that, Joker.

01:13:40.564 --> 01:13:41.766
Sheesh.

01:13:53.778 --> 01:13:56.180
Must be tough being a hero!

01:13:59.615 --> 01:14:03.921
You don't dare kill me!
Isn't that right, Bats?

01:14:07.224 --> 01:14:08.426
<i>Don't test me!</i>

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:15.432
See, you can't kill me.

01:14:25.341 --> 01:14:31.181
Oh, the hero
can't finish the job!

01:14:33.382 --> 01:14:35.784
But I can.

01:14:35.786 --> 01:14:38.753
Just look at how much
fun we're having,

01:14:38.755 --> 01:14:40.257
Batman.

01:15:04.715 --> 01:15:05.916
Psych!

01:15:35.746 --> 01:15:37.981
You liked that,
didn't you?

01:16:14.117 --> 01:16:16.220
It's not over!

01:16:56.525 --> 01:17:00.430
And so it's
finally over, Batman.

01:17:06.036 --> 01:17:08.873
You can't trust
everything you see, Joker.

01:18:07.162 --> 01:18:09.998
Do it. Just let go.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.732
You can't do it,
can you?

01:18:19.576 --> 01:18:25.546
The great Batman.
Not such a hero after all!

01:19:01.818 --> 01:19:04.085
<i>Thank you
for all your help.</i>

01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:07.988
Of course. Our country can now
return to the way it was.

01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:11.127
<i>We will never forget
what you have done for us.</i>

01:19:12.829 --> 01:19:16.033
Thank you, Monkichi.
You were a great help.

01:19:18.467 --> 01:19:21.438
It's time for me to go.
I'll never forget you.

01:19:58.408 --> 01:20:00.377
Activate
the Quake Engine.

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:31.368
<i>Master Bruce,</i>

01:21:33.569 --> 01:21:37.004
you'll be needing
this for tonight.

01:21:37.006 --> 01:21:40.508
Huh? Ah, right,
of course.

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:43.177
Best not to keep
the Mayor waiting.

01:21:43.179 --> 01:21:44.812
Is the car ready?

01:21:44.814 --> 01:21:48.418
Yes. But it's
rather vintage.

01:21:56.525 --> 01:22:00.363
<i>Tell me, where did you
come across such a rare find.</i>

01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:04.632
I just ran across it
on a trip.

01:22:04.634 --> 01:22:08.905
I always keep my eye out
for interesting souvenirs.

01:22:22.152 --> 01:22:26.489
You didn't expect me
to leave empty-handed, did you?

01:22:59.358 --> 01:23:04.358
