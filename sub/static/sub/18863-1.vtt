05:07.740 --> 05:09.260
They're here.

05:09.340 --> 05:10.740
They're coming, sir.

05:14.620 --> 05:18.300
Hand me those files on the death
of young Williams, will you, please?

05:40.980 --> 05:43.700
Colonel Waldron, you know Herr Rinder.

05:44.780 --> 05:47.180
Herr Doktor from the Swiss Red Cross.

05:48.060 --> 05:50.060
Oberleutnant Strauss.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.940
Major Von Steiner.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.980
Colonel Waldron is
the senior British officer.

06:01.020 --> 06:03.700
Major Rose,
head of the lntelligence Committee.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.260
Wing Commander Shurlock,
head of their Escape Committee.

06:06.340 --> 06:07.540
Nicht wahr?

06:08.060 --> 06:10.220
I think you've come to investigate
the killing of my officer.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.580
An accident.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.780
I would like the Red Cross
to see the whole camp.

06:13.860 --> 06:16.140
Your sleeping quarters, mess, toilets.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.140
And see that you are being treated well...

06:18.180 --> 06:21.140
...according to the spirit
of the Geneva Convention.

06:31.860 --> 06:32.980
Come on.

06:56.620 --> 06:59.020
Please, sir, can I have my ball back?

07:18.260 --> 07:19.860
You are the Sportfuhrer?

07:21.020 --> 07:22.020
I'm Colby.

07:22.660 --> 07:23.700
Colby?

07:24.060 --> 07:25.500
That's very familiar.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.180
It's a common name.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.140
They're very enthusiastic.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.900
No bloody good, but very enthusiastic.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.780
Do you play matches?

07:35.860 --> 07:38.300
Oh, yeah, we have a league.
Four divisions.

07:38.620 --> 07:40.020
We even play internationals.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.140
Internationals?

07:41.180 --> 07:41.980
Yeah.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.140
England, lreland, Scotland, Wales.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.940
You call that international?

07:46.020 --> 07:48.980
It would be international
if you played against Germany.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.460
We'd murder you.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.740
Colby! John Colby.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.860
Yes. Westham United and England.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.140
That's right.

07:59.860 --> 08:02.260
It's a shame the war
has ended your career.

08:02.620 --> 08:03.780
Interrupted.

08:05.140 --> 08:06.380
Let's hope so.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.860
The colonel's protest will be
a waste of breath, I'm afraid.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.220
Two hearts.

09:07.460 --> 09:11.100
If we don't kick up a stink, we give
the blighters permission to do it again.

09:11.140 --> 09:12.180
No bid.

09:12.580 --> 09:13.580
Pass.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.620
Colby, what were you talking
to Jerry about?

09:17.300 --> 09:18.860
None of your business.

09:18.940 --> 09:20.180
Two spades.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.940
It is our business.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.940
You were seen in conversation
with the enemy, a Major Von Steiner.

09:26.140 --> 09:27.300
What did he want?

09:27.380 --> 09:28.740
He recognized me.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.100
As what? Pass.

09:30.580 --> 09:31.420
Pass.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.260
So the major's a football fan, huh?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.180
Elementary, my dear Shurlock.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.980
Karl von Steiner played
for Germany in 1938.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.780
What did he say to you?

09:39.860 --> 09:40.940
Buzz off.

09:41.020 --> 09:42.580
-In German?
-Yeah.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.780
I think I'm getting something.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.580
...working to extremes
to divert world attention...

09:47.660 --> 09:49.500
...from their losses in North Africa...

09:49.540 --> 09:53.580
...and the reported inhumane treatment of
the prisoners from East European nations.

09:59.780 --> 10:01.580
Over here, over here.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.820
What's the verdict on Williams?

10:16.700 --> 10:18.220
Regrettable mistake.

10:19.060 --> 10:21.380
The whole bloody war's
a regrettable mistake.

10:21.460 --> 10:22.420
I agree.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.460
Do you?

10:24.860 --> 10:27.380
You can believe me or not,
it's nothing to me.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.980
If nations could settle their differences
on the football pitch...

10:31.060 --> 10:33.020
...wouldn't that be a challenge?

10:33.820 --> 10:35.460
How would you like...

10:35.540 --> 10:38.420
...to play a game against a team
from the Wehrmacht?

10:39.260 --> 10:41.420
A team from the army base nearby?

10:42.460 --> 10:44.260
What for? To settle the war?

10:44.700 --> 10:46.100
Unfortunately not.

10:46.420 --> 10:48.180
Let's say, for morale.

10:48.820 --> 10:49.980
Yours or ours?

10:50.540 --> 10:51.700
For both.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.260
Life in this place must be very boring.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.140
What sort of team? They any good?

11:01.180 --> 11:03.780
I haven't chosen a team. It's just an idea.

11:04.820 --> 11:06.500
It's not an order. You can't make us play.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.140
No, it's a challenge.

11:11.180 --> 11:12.420
No.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.820
It'd be a washout. A complete washout.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.100
Why?

11:16.780 --> 11:18.140
Look at them.

11:18.180 --> 11:20.540
Look at them. They're bloody useless.

11:21.220 --> 11:24.180
I mean, look at those clothes,
and those bloody great boots.

11:24.260 --> 11:27.180
They're charging about there
like a herd of elephants.

11:27.260 --> 11:29.660
Play football? They can hardly stand up.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.660
Boots can be supplied.

11:32.980 --> 11:35.900
You mean, proper gear?
Shirts and shorts?

11:37.660 --> 11:39.020
No.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.260
They couldn't run about for 90 minutes.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.460
They'd be chuckin' their guts out.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.580
All right, I'm sorry.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.020
Major....

11:52.220 --> 11:53.660
I'd want...

11:53.900 --> 11:56.380
...special conditions, special rations.

11:56.860 --> 11:59.700
The team would have to live together,
eat together....

12:00.580 --> 12:02.460
I'd want meat...

12:02.940 --> 12:05.020
...fresh vegetables, eggs...

12:06.100 --> 12:07.060
...beer.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.180
You talk to your colonel?

12:09.460 --> 12:13.180
No matter what he says,
if you could supply us with all that stuff...

12:13.780 --> 12:15.780
...you'll have a game of football.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.100
Which reminds me...

12:18.260 --> 12:19.860
...if it's confined to officers...

12:19.940 --> 12:21.660
...I'm not bloody playing.

12:22.020 --> 12:24.500
I want a decent team. I want the lads...

12:25.660 --> 12:27.060
...from over there.

12:27.660 --> 12:28.660
Okay?

12:30.300 --> 12:31.420
We shall see.

12:31.580 --> 12:32.740
All right.

12:35.060 --> 12:36.220
Just a minute.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.820
Right. Escapes.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.980
We've had all the usual requests...

12:45.020 --> 12:47.260
...but here's a new one you might like.

12:47.340 --> 12:51.100
Peter Bailey has a plan to pole-vault
the south fence.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.100
God, what will they think of next?

12:54.460 --> 12:56.100
Oh, Christ, refused.

12:57.020 --> 12:58.220
Anything else?

12:58.300 --> 13:00.220
No. Let's have Hatch in.

13:01.900 --> 13:02.900
Hatch.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.140
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.620
You're an American?

13:07.700 --> 13:10.340
Enlisted Canadian Army '38,
transferred commandos.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.740
How long have you been with us?

13:11.780 --> 13:12.980
Since Dieppe.

13:13.820 --> 13:15.180
How many attempts?

13:15.820 --> 13:19.420
Two on the way, three since then.
Time before last, I got as far as Stuttgart.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.940
How's this one going?

13:21.020 --> 13:22.780
Well, sir, the whole thing
depends on the fact that...

13:22.820 --> 13:26.100
...some of the goons don't patrol
when we're havin' a shower.

13:26.260 --> 13:27.380
Some of them?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.300
Yes. Like Hans and Anton.

13:29.380 --> 13:32.220
At least one of them should be outside
walking back and forth...

13:32.260 --> 13:34.620
...but they know we're inside
havin' a shower.

13:34.660 --> 13:38.500
They come inside, lean against the door,
have a smoke if they can bum one.

13:38.580 --> 13:41.020
I think if somebody went missing,
they wouldn't report it.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.500
-Why not?
-They wouldn't be sure.

13:42.580 --> 13:45.180
They'd think they'd miscounted
and leave it until roll call.

13:45.260 --> 13:48.220
And if you could cover for me at roll call,
I could be gone for days.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.500
Wait a minute.

13:49.980 --> 13:52.780
You're going too fast for me. How are you
gonna get out of the wash house?

13:52.860 --> 13:55.660
There is a vent in the shower room.
It leads into a storeroom or something.

13:55.740 --> 13:56.820
Yes, I know.

13:56.980 --> 13:59.900
It must have been built as a lavatory
to match the one on the German side.

13:59.980 --> 14:02.060
If I can get in there,
with something to pick the lock--

14:02.140 --> 14:04.220
And you'd be back in the enclosure
where you started.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.740
But I'd be all alone. There's no one there.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.340
And I could get onto the roof...

14:08.420 --> 14:11.980
...go underneath the barbed wire
and drop into the German compound.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.180
Naked?

14:15.940 --> 14:19.340
How are you planning to get out
of the German compound naked?

14:20.020 --> 14:21.820
I've got five or six ideas.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.180
Shall we discuss them?

14:25.820 --> 14:26.620
Yes.

14:33.460 --> 14:37.260
Colby insisted on playing the other ranks
against the best of the officers.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.220
What's the idea behind that?

14:39.260 --> 14:42.260
I suppose he wants to pick
the best team possible.

14:43.460 --> 14:46.060
I don't think he's quite got the point,
has he?

14:47.140 --> 14:49.460
Tell him to come and see me, will you?

14:49.900 --> 14:52.460
Cover him, Tony. Let's go.

14:53.900 --> 14:56.460
Good goal. Well done, sir.

14:56.780 --> 14:58.620
-What's your name?
-Sid Harmer.

14:58.980 --> 15:01.140
How'd you like double rations
for a month or so, Sid?

15:01.180 --> 15:02.940
Whose mother
do you want me to strangle?

15:03.020 --> 15:04.260
Welcome aboard.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.460
Okay, I'm ready to sign up.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.020
Sign off, Hatch.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.780
Give 'em the ball. Stop it.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.060
Come on.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.460
Tackle it.

15:19.220 --> 15:20.220
Nice try.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.940
Thanks, Colby.
It's not quite like playing for Manchester...

15:22.980 --> 15:24.500
...but it's better than not playing at all.

15:24.580 --> 15:25.940
Welcome aboard.

15:26.220 --> 15:27.100
What about me?

15:27.180 --> 15:28.140
Get out there.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.060
What about me?

15:29.140 --> 15:30.780
Get out there and play.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.620
The map of Marburg is from an old
guidebook, but it's reliable, I should hope.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.740
There's a fast train to Cologne
at 5:33 every Saturday.

15:41.860 --> 15:45.060
Now, under the map you'll see
they've done a sketch of the stadium...

15:45.140 --> 15:48.100
...the exits, perspectives,
and changing rooms.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.300
Colonel...

15:50.060 --> 15:51.220
...what are you talking about?

15:51.260 --> 15:53.700
I'm talking about your escape, Colby.

15:59.060 --> 16:00.100
My escape?

16:01.460 --> 16:04.220
Yes, of course.
The whole team if possible.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.340
What about the lorry
that's taking you to the match?

16:06.420 --> 16:08.420
You could loosen the floorboards
on the way in and...

16:08.500 --> 16:09.340
...drop out on the way back.

16:09.420 --> 16:12.220
You stick to scrounging, Pyrie,
and I'll stick to football.

16:12.260 --> 16:15.020
It's your duty, Colby, as an officer.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.780
It could be an excellent opportunity.

16:16.860 --> 16:18.620
It's certainly worth considering, old boy.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.660
I am not interested in getting them killed.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.340
Are you afraid to try?

16:22.620 --> 16:25.460
Your escaping is
just some bloody upper-crust game.

16:27.740 --> 16:30.740
They've done their job
and want to be left alone till it's over.

16:30.780 --> 16:32.780
Now, that will be all, Colby.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.420
Thank you.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.020
Come on, Hatch.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.740
-Good tackle, Terry.
-Come on, Terry.

18:02.820 --> 18:03.740
Go.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.540
Did you see that?
Am I good, or am I good?

18:07.100 --> 18:08.980
-What's your name?
-You know my name.

18:09.020 --> 18:11.380
-What's your name?
-Terry. Terry Brady.

18:12.260 --> 18:14.660
How'd you like to come and live
with the officers?

18:14.740 --> 18:16.380
Only if you've got a chaperone, mate.

18:16.460 --> 18:17.820
Welcome aboard, Terry.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.540
Where'd you learn to do that?

18:44.580 --> 18:46.340
When I was a boy...

18:47.260 --> 18:48.620
...in Trinidad...

18:50.220 --> 18:52.500
...on the streets, with the oranges.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.020
How'd you like to play football
against the Germans?

18:58.100 --> 18:59.340
Why not?

19:02.140 --> 19:03.580
Unload him, Tony.

19:08.860 --> 19:10.220
Hey, foul there.

19:10.300 --> 19:13.180
Stupid, bloody Yank!
What the hell do you think this is?

19:13.260 --> 19:15.220
-Bloody hell!
-Well, what'd I do?

19:15.300 --> 19:16.540
You know bloody well.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.620
No, you tell me. What'd I do?

19:17.700 --> 19:20.780
You can't tackle like that in soccer.
I've told you that for a year!

19:20.860 --> 19:22.420
I was just goin' for the ball.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.340
You use that bloody American style
again here, and you'll be barred.

19:25.420 --> 19:26.820
You play English, I play American.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.620
We don't play the bloody American game.
Get off.

19:30.380 --> 19:33.260
Hey, what kind of game is this?
For old ladies and fairies?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.420
I quit.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.100
Okay.

19:37.060 --> 19:39.580
One, two, three...

19:40.380 --> 19:44.420
...four, five, six, seven...

19:45.500 --> 19:48.340
...eight, nine, turn.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.220
One, two...

19:52.300 --> 19:55.100
...three, four, five--

19:55.300 --> 19:58.260
Hatch, the committee
has considered your plan.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.620
You may see the tailor and the forger.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.860
And the locksmith.
I've got to see the locksmith.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.180
Yes, but see the tailor first.
That takes time.

20:05.260 --> 20:08.820
...seven, eight, nine, turn.

20:09.980 --> 20:11.020
Thanks.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.860
Hey, Colby.

20:17.660 --> 20:19.660
Colby, I've been looking for you.

20:20.060 --> 20:22.300
You know that football team of yours?

20:22.500 --> 20:25.380
Know what you can do with that team?
Know where you can put it?

20:25.460 --> 20:27.340
'Cause I don't want to be on that team.

20:27.420 --> 20:31.380
As a matter of fact, you couldn't pay me
to be on that football team, Colby.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.500
You got it, Colby?

20:33.580 --> 20:36.540
I don't need you
or your football team anymore.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.980
You got it?
I don't need this aggravation, Colby.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.140
Captain Colby. How are you?

20:53.260 --> 20:54.620
Sit down, please.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.180
Why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

21:05.460 --> 21:09.140
Our football match has been taken
a little out of our hands.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.140
It has been decided...

21:12.220 --> 21:14.380
...that a German national team will play...

21:14.460 --> 21:18.260
...a combined team from the prisoners
of war of the occupied territories...

21:18.340 --> 21:22.140
...August 15th,
at Colombes Stadium in Paris.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.100
Paris?

21:25.700 --> 21:26.940
That's crazy.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.940
Come in, Muller.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.340
This is Hauptmann Rainer Muller.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.220
Coach for our national team.

21:34.300 --> 21:35.700
Captain John Colby.

21:36.780 --> 21:37.860
We've met.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.340
A long time ago.

21:40.620 --> 21:42.260
Yeah. In London.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.460
You were center-half.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.980
Hauptmann Muller will assist me
and manage our team.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.300
Make sure you have everything you need.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.020
Paris.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.580
What if I refuse?

22:01.260 --> 22:03.860
I think you will recognize
some of those names.

22:17.220 --> 22:18.420
No, thank you.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.300
Yeah.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.940
There are some good players on here.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.140
British, French.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.060
Dutch.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.580
Even a Norwegian.

22:34.540 --> 22:36.580
What about the Poles and the Czechs?

22:36.660 --> 22:39.420
I mean, off the top of my head
I could think of...

22:39.740 --> 22:43.660
...half a dozen East European players
who would have to be on that squad.

22:45.980 --> 22:46.900
Isn't that so, Muller?

22:46.980 --> 22:50.100
I'm sorry. I cannot let you have
any Eastern Europeans.

22:50.300 --> 22:51.300
Why not?

22:51.620 --> 22:52.620
It's impossible.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.580
Officially, they do not exist.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.260
Germany does not recognize them
as prisoners of war.

22:57.340 --> 22:58.820
They're in labor camps.

22:58.900 --> 23:02.140
Well, maybe not officially,
but they do exist as players...

23:03.700 --> 23:04.860
...don't they?

23:05.100 --> 23:08.780
I don't know whether these
East European players are alive or dead...

23:09.820 --> 23:11.700
...but you can find that out.

23:13.380 --> 23:15.340
As an officer and a gentleman...

23:15.420 --> 23:18.580
...you are obliged to give me
a marginal chance of winning.

23:28.820 --> 23:30.500
Make your list, Captain.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.780
I'll see what I can do.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.140
Collaboration pays.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.420
I don't consider it collaboration.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.540
And you are to be exhibited in Paris
like performing fleas?

23:51.420 --> 23:54.260
I don't think London is going
to take very kindly to this, you know.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.860
You've informed London?

23:55.940 --> 23:57.340
There's no need.

23:57.780 --> 24:00.820
The German propaganda machine
will take care of that.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.660
Get that, Hatch.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.020
Oh, a customer, good.

24:12.380 --> 24:14.900
-Captain Lawry, how are you?
-I'm very well, very well.

24:14.940 --> 24:17.180
If you'll just get dressed.

24:17.260 --> 24:19.140
That's it. Over there.

24:19.580 --> 24:23.020
Will you be so kind as to stand guard
while I deal with our American friend?

24:23.100 --> 24:23.580
Okay.

24:23.660 --> 24:26.340
Stay where you are, Billy. Just listen.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.220
Here we are.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.220
Have you shaved?

24:41.340 --> 24:42.500
Good enough?

24:42.620 --> 24:43.900
Very good.

24:44.940 --> 24:47.260
You know, it's really very gratifying.

24:47.420 --> 24:50.380
I'm surprised at
the relatively good conditions here.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.220
Compared to other camps, that is.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.220
Everyone still wants to escape.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.540
Getting dressed? Good.

25:05.860 --> 25:07.580
Don't want to dilly-dally.

25:11.660 --> 25:15.420
Now, I can't promise you
a studio portrait, but it'll do.

25:18.780 --> 25:20.900
You didn't make the lens as well,
did you?

25:20.980 --> 25:23.860
No. I'm a genius, not a magician.

25:24.380 --> 25:25.380
Sit down.

25:27.740 --> 25:29.460
All right, now, don't smile.

25:29.580 --> 25:33.500
We want that criminal look
associated with passport photographs.

25:34.580 --> 25:37.820
Solemn, depressed--
The jacket's up. That's lovely.

25:37.980 --> 25:39.180
Now, hold that.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.180
Wait. One more for luck?

25:42.260 --> 25:44.180
No. Film's too valuable. Sorry.

25:44.260 --> 25:45.300
This'll do.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.060
Now, here we are.

25:53.860 --> 25:56.660
Now, Dupin's the name you want, is it?

25:56.860 --> 25:59.580
Yeah. Marcel Dupin, electrician.

25:59.900 --> 26:03.700
I need an address in Lyon and papers
to show I'm a conscripted worker.

26:03.780 --> 26:06.860
Yes. Why does Monsieur Dupin
want to go home?

26:08.700 --> 26:10.900
Compassionate leave, death in the family.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.220
-Can you do it?
-Yes, it's quite simple.

26:13.300 --> 26:16.300
Quite simple. Might even manage
a letter on your bereavement.

26:16.380 --> 26:17.380
Let's see.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.060
What have we got?

26:19.900 --> 26:21.460
French police...

26:22.060 --> 26:25.180
...enter Germany, health officer,
military district....

26:25.260 --> 26:27.660
They keep changing.
That's very inconsiderate of them.

26:27.740 --> 26:28.540
Very.

26:28.580 --> 26:30.100
How long will it take?

26:30.500 --> 26:32.860
Well, you must realize, it's my busy time.

26:32.940 --> 26:34.860
Everybody wants to escape
in the good weather.

26:34.940 --> 26:36.860
Just be patient.

26:37.180 --> 26:37.980
All right?

26:38.020 --> 26:39.860
Be patient. Yeah. Thanks.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.100
What the hell's that?

27:04.540 --> 27:06.420
Who the hell are those guys?

27:12.180 --> 27:14.460
I've had it. Look.
They've switched the guards on me.

27:14.540 --> 27:17.300
Those goons are patrolling
like they're supposed to.

27:17.340 --> 27:19.060
-Yes, I know.
-What do you mean, you know?

27:19.100 --> 27:19.940
I know.

27:20.020 --> 27:23.060
Hans and Anton have been switched
to watch over the football team.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.860
Colby's football team?

27:25.540 --> 27:28.380
They're my guards. I needed them.
A couple weeks, I was out of here.

27:28.420 --> 27:30.900
That's bad luck.
Just between ourselves, Hatch...

27:30.940 --> 27:33.740
...l never thought it was
a very good plan, anyway.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.260
Here we are.

27:47.940 --> 27:50.060
Luis, this is Arthur.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.900
-Hello, Arthur.
-Sid and Terry.

27:51.980 --> 27:53.260
Luis Fernandez.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.060
Terry.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.540
Here's your beds over here.

27:55.580 --> 27:56.980
I'll have the top one.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.780
Help yourself. First come, first served.

27:58.860 --> 28:00.380
I'll take the bottom one.

28:00.460 --> 28:01.820
Okay, just leave me one.

28:01.860 --> 28:04.100
-Not bad, is it?
-It's like the Savoy Hotel.

28:04.180 --> 28:05.420
How would you know?

28:05.500 --> 28:07.540
There are no bleeding chambermaids.

28:08.700 --> 28:09.540
This one?

28:09.620 --> 28:10.580
Hi, guys.

28:16.660 --> 28:19.980
-What do you think you're doing?
-I decided to join the team.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.900
Tell me everything.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.300
Being on this team
is a one-way ticket out of here, right?

28:28.860 --> 28:30.020
You're not on this team.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.500
Oh, yeah, sure I am.

28:32.340 --> 28:33.900
-I'm the trainer.
-The what?

28:33.980 --> 28:35.060
The trainer.

28:35.180 --> 28:39.340
Colby, you forgot to put in for a trainer.
Maybe I can't play your kind of football...

28:39.420 --> 28:42.940
...but in my kind, you know everything
there is to know about bruises, sprains....

28:43.020 --> 28:45.140
So if you'll just get on
to your Von Steiner...

28:45.180 --> 28:49.140
...to get me some bandages,
some lineaments, some oils, some tapes...

28:49.220 --> 28:50.700
...we're in business.

28:53.780 --> 28:55.460
I don't want a trainer.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.140
Colby, I'm a ballplayer.

28:59.260 --> 29:01.460
I don't want to be left out
of somethin' like this.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.140
Pull the other one.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.260
I just want to be around the guys.

29:07.340 --> 29:08.460
Bullshit!

29:24.060 --> 29:25.100
Don't do this to me.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.740
-I don't need a con man.
-Easy, Colby.

29:26.780 --> 29:29.380
-You and your team wrecked my escape.
-How?

29:31.460 --> 29:33.460
I was ready. I was waiting for my papers.

29:33.500 --> 29:37.260
I was going through the wash house,
but only if those two goons were on duty.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.860
Now those two goons
have been transferred to you.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.580
So the only way out of here
is by bein' on that team.

29:42.620 --> 29:43.580
No.

29:44.900 --> 29:45.660
Why not?

29:45.700 --> 29:47.740
I won't be responsible for your death.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.540
You'll get yourself shot.

29:53.660 --> 29:55.420
That's my choice, isn't it?

30:01.580 --> 30:03.220
So what is it, "yes" or "no"?

30:06.260 --> 30:07.220
Okay.

30:37.980 --> 30:38.980
Tony.

30:39.860 --> 30:41.580
-Nice to see you.
-Great to see you. How are you?

30:41.660 --> 30:43.700
-Hello. Hatch, the trainer.
-Hi.

30:43.780 --> 30:45.260
-Doug Clure?
-Yeah.

30:45.340 --> 30:46.900
-What's going on?
-I'll tell you in a minute.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.180
-Hatch, the trainer, hi.
-Remy, Jean-Paul.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.580
Colby's mine.

30:49.780 --> 30:51.100
Michel Filieu.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.580
Hatch, the trainer.
Welcome to my holiday camp.

30:53.660 --> 30:55.420
Hello. How are you? Hello.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.980
-Erik Borg, right?
-Yes.

30:57.020 --> 30:57.820
Colby.

30:57.860 --> 30:59.540
-Hatch, the trainer.
-Hello.

30:59.580 --> 31:02.220
-Hello. How are you?
-I am Pieter Van Beck.

31:02.940 --> 31:03.860
Come inside.

31:03.900 --> 31:04.980
Hatch, the trainer.

31:05.060 --> 31:07.580
We'll have something to eat,
and I'll explain.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.500
The extra food is part of the deal.

31:10.860 --> 31:13.540
We still respond to roll call
three times a day...

31:13.820 --> 31:16.340
...but apart from that,
we make our own rules.

31:17.420 --> 31:20.300
There is no rank here.
This is a football team.

31:20.740 --> 31:22.820
I am the captain and the manager.

31:23.660 --> 31:24.940
Any questions?

31:26.900 --> 31:28.700
I don't know how you did it...

31:30.420 --> 31:31.940
...but cheers anyway.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.340
It's been a long time...

31:33.420 --> 31:35.820
...and none of us feels like or...

31:36.180 --> 31:37.980
...looks like world-class players.

31:39.700 --> 31:42.060
It'll be tough getting into shape
with those boots...

31:42.140 --> 31:45.420
...so let's hope the German major
gives us the proper gear.

31:48.380 --> 31:51.740
We gotta start somewhere,
so let's start with basics, shall we?

31:51.940 --> 31:54.940
Slow, easy, stretching it fully. Okay?

31:55.740 --> 31:57.780
We won't be needing that for a while.

31:58.940 --> 32:01.660
Come on, put 'em down.
Let's go. Pick 'em up.

32:01.780 --> 32:03.220
Left, left.

32:03.300 --> 32:04.740
Left, right. Left, right.

32:04.820 --> 32:07.460
Pick 'em up. Pick 'em up.
Put 'em down. Good.

32:07.740 --> 32:09.740
Good. Good. Good.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.740
Good, Colby. Come on, guys.
Pick 'em up, put 'em down.

32:13.820 --> 32:14.780
Good.

32:15.260 --> 32:17.580
They're all different sizes,
so make sure everything fits.

32:17.660 --> 32:18.660
Everything fits.

32:18.740 --> 32:21.900
And I want you all to know
that if you're havin' any trouble with, say...

32:21.980 --> 32:25.020
...appendicitis, heart attacks....
That's okay. There's no problem.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.500
I can handle that. But listen...

32:26.580 --> 32:28.580
...l don't want any blisters.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.940
No blisters allowed.

32:31.020 --> 32:33.980
So if there's anything wrong
with any of you guys, tell me now...

32:34.060 --> 32:35.140
...not later, okay.

32:35.220 --> 32:39.220
Minor inconveniences,
say like anal bleeding, tuberculosis...

32:39.420 --> 32:42.380
...growing tumors, little inconveniences
like that. All right?

32:42.460 --> 32:43.660
Shut up, Hatch.

32:43.740 --> 32:46.460
I'm just trying to get some team spirit
going here. Right guys?

32:46.500 --> 32:47.580
Yeah, right.

32:47.860 --> 32:49.020
Make sure everything fits.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.500
Yeah, everything fits. Everything fits.

32:51.980 --> 32:53.900
I'll keep this myself.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.100
Take no notice, lads. They're only jealous.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.140
Up your's.

34:58.180 --> 35:01.100
If you can get up here,
don't try and run through.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.460
Don't try and be a hero
and get a goal yourself.

35:03.540 --> 35:07.660
That center...l want up there,
and I want you to pass. Always pass.

35:08.060 --> 35:10.860
Let the ball do the running for you.
Don't try and run with it.

35:10.940 --> 35:13.660
You're in no condition to run
for 90 minutes, I tell you.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.100
This especially applies to wingers.

35:15.180 --> 35:18.580
If you can't cross, don't run it through.
Try and get a corner.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.740
A set piece works in our favor.

35:21.140 --> 35:22.460
Which means that, as they--

35:22.540 --> 35:23.820
Give me this.

35:23.900 --> 35:27.420
Colby, after givin' me ball here,
I do this...

35:30.700 --> 35:33.140
...this, this, goal.

35:33.580 --> 35:34.220
Easy.

35:36.060 --> 35:37.700
That's the right spirit, Luis.

35:37.820 --> 35:40.540
Keep it up. Before you know it,
you'll have me thinking it's easy.

35:40.660 --> 35:43.500
Colby, old chap,
Waldron would like a word.

35:44.860 --> 35:46.340
I'll be right back, lads.

35:59.660 --> 36:01.300
How did they get here?

36:02.780 --> 36:04.340
I insisted on having them.

36:05.020 --> 36:06.220
You insisted?

36:07.940 --> 36:09.660
They're all great players.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.300
They were.

36:14.780 --> 36:17.180
You are a naive fool, Colby.

36:17.580 --> 36:19.380
Insisting on great players.

36:19.700 --> 36:24.300
Von Steiner has sent you five skeletons,
guarantees that you'll turn up in Paris...

36:24.540 --> 36:26.260
...for his propaganda victory.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.740
The Germans are doing their job very well.

36:28.940 --> 36:30.100
London knows.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.380
We heard it on the news.

36:31.420 --> 36:32.980
It's in all the papers.

36:33.340 --> 36:35.540
They're calling it another German lie.

36:35.580 --> 36:39.060
London is saying that no British officer
would ever be involved in such a game.

36:39.100 --> 36:40.900
London is saying, Colonel?

36:41.740 --> 36:44.100
What about those poor bastards there?

36:45.660 --> 36:48.020
Do we send them back
to the labor camps?

36:48.380 --> 36:50.420
That's a very good question, Colby.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.420
They can't go in there like that.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.900
Full of lice.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.460
Should take 'em around back, scrub 'em...

37:03.540 --> 37:05.940
...take off what they're wearin' and burn it.

37:05.980 --> 37:07.620
You guys want to get some water?

37:07.700 --> 37:08.820
Anybody got any soap?

37:08.860 --> 37:10.900
Yeah, I have. I've got DDT, as well.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.100
All right.

37:12.460 --> 37:14.380
Come on, guys. Get some water.

38:06.540 --> 38:08.700
I'm responsible for them being here.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.900
And I'm responsible for them
being sent back, if we don't play.

38:18.940 --> 38:20.220
I can't do that.

38:22.780 --> 38:26.420
But I can't tell any of you
to disobey his high command.

38:28.220 --> 38:30.940
So each of you will have to make
his own decision.

38:31.740 --> 38:32.980
We play.

38:33.820 --> 38:35.300
What else can we do?

38:37.620 --> 38:38.900
Yes, we play.

38:39.740 --> 38:40.580
Yeah?

38:41.980 --> 38:44.260
-Everybody?
-Yeah, come on, let's play.

38:44.580 --> 38:45.780
Of course, we'll play.

38:47.420 --> 38:49.580
Come on. Looking good.

38:50.940 --> 38:54.060
You got a good bunch out there.
These guys are comin' along real fine.

38:54.140 --> 38:56.580
I think the Germans are gonna have to
go some to beat them.

38:56.660 --> 38:59.020
-You're an optimist.
-Well, what are you?

39:01.780 --> 39:03.180
That's not bad, Hatch.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.620
What's not bad?

39:04.860 --> 39:05.940
Using your hands.

39:06.020 --> 39:07.940
You've got feet, I've got hands.

39:09.100 --> 39:10.260
Gimme that.

39:12.620 --> 39:14.460
-Get in there.
-Sure thing, General.

39:14.540 --> 39:15.500
Luis.

39:16.300 --> 39:17.300
Luis....

39:17.820 --> 39:19.460
Fire a few at him.

39:20.340 --> 39:22.420
You've got to do better than that.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.020
Come on, you guys. Let's fire 'em in here.

39:24.060 --> 39:25.740
There we go. Here we go. Come on.

39:25.820 --> 39:27.220
Yeah, here we go. Put it in here.

39:27.260 --> 39:28.460
Give me some balls, Charley.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.580
You're gonna get serious now, huh?

39:30.620 --> 39:33.540
Okay, guys, come on, fire 'em in here.
Fire 'em in here. Let's go. All right?

39:33.620 --> 39:35.900
Let's go. Come on. Don't be afraid of me.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.940
Yeah. What, what's that?

39:38.860 --> 39:40.420
Right down the middle.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.580
Can you do it with your mouth shut?

39:43.100 --> 39:45.540
The mouth and the hands
work together as a team.

39:45.620 --> 39:46.860
Come on, come on.

39:46.940 --> 39:48.620
Get your body behind it.

39:48.700 --> 39:52.060
Not like that, like that.
Hands behind it, pull it into the chest.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.460
I'm aware of that.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.420
Come on, Hatch. I want to see it now.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.580
Come on, right there in the middle.

40:00.860 --> 40:02.500
I thought you were my friend.

40:02.580 --> 40:04.100
I am your friend.

40:04.980 --> 40:07.420
You know, Hatch, to be honest with you...

40:08.220 --> 40:09.860
...you don't kick well...

40:10.020 --> 40:11.780
...you don't dribble well...

40:12.100 --> 40:14.340
...but you could be a good goalkeeper.

40:14.460 --> 40:16.260
-Keep trying.
-Thanks a lot.

40:16.460 --> 40:18.300
He's right. You're not bad.

40:23.460 --> 40:24.980
Ca va, Monsieur Dupin ?

40:25.020 --> 40:26.900
I'm good. Do you have my papers?

40:26.940 --> 40:29.340
I kept my word. It was ready,
but the colonel took it.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.460
-He wants to see you.
-The colonel?

40:32.380 --> 40:34.820
-The colonel took my passport?
-Yes, he did.

40:37.020 --> 40:37.980
Thanks.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.780
How's the French coming along?

40:39.860 --> 40:41.460
-Comme ci comme ca.
-You don't need much.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.460
I am going to a funeral. Fine.

40:44.220 --> 40:46.860
Je vais a un enterrement,
something like that.

40:47.180 --> 40:48.380
That's good.

40:51.140 --> 40:53.460
Remember to take your identity tag
when you go.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.380
-We don't want you shot as a spy, do we?
-No.

40:55.420 --> 40:57.300
I don't want to be shot as anything.

40:57.340 --> 40:58.460
Au revoir.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.260
He's on his way, sir.

41:03.340 --> 41:04.340
Good.

41:07.700 --> 41:08.740
Enter.

41:09.860 --> 41:10.780
Hatch.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.500
-Hello.
-Sit down.

41:14.660 --> 41:16.620
-Cup of tea?
-Yes, please.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.260
Tea?

41:18.460 --> 41:19.540
Beautiful.

41:20.100 --> 41:22.660
God knows what the fellow will do
in civilian life.

41:22.740 --> 41:25.980
Make his own pound notes
and share certificates, I shouldn't think.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.340
Are you ready?

41:27.900 --> 41:28.820
Pretty near.

41:28.860 --> 41:30.740
Anything else we can do for you?

41:30.780 --> 41:32.700
No. I just want to thank you all
for helping out.

41:32.780 --> 41:35.300
Don't thank us, old boy. It's a team effort.

41:35.780 --> 41:38.420
What Pyrie means is that nowadays
the Germans are up to all the tricks.

41:38.460 --> 41:41.060
It's almost impossible
to escape without help.

41:41.300 --> 41:44.780
Helping one another is the most
important part of the whole thing.

41:44.980 --> 41:47.820
How would you like to do something
to help us, Hatch?

41:47.900 --> 41:50.180
Provided, of course, that you get out.

41:50.260 --> 41:52.940
Which way were you planning to go?

41:53.700 --> 41:55.820
To Lyon then to the Swiss border.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.100
Switzerland?

41:57.900 --> 42:01.020
I suppose you hadn't thought of
going via Paris, had you?

42:01.260 --> 42:02.660
No. Paris? No, sir.

42:02.740 --> 42:04.180
I think you'd find it easier.

42:04.260 --> 42:06.180
They wouldn't expect you to go that way.

42:06.260 --> 42:08.660
But I'm still in occupied territory.
Where do I go from there?

42:08.700 --> 42:12.540
We could supply you with contacts,
names, safe houses....

42:13.100 --> 42:14.940
You'd be well looked after.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.780
No, thanks.

42:18.180 --> 42:21.260
I thank you all for your concern, but
I'm really not planning on seein' Paris...

42:21.340 --> 42:22.940
...until after the war.

42:27.420 --> 42:28.700
Why, Colonel?

42:30.460 --> 42:33.180
We want you to contact
the Resistance for us.

42:34.020 --> 42:34.980
What?

42:35.300 --> 42:37.740
And arrange the escape
of the football team.

42:48.940 --> 42:50.300
Colby's escape?

42:50.380 --> 42:51.380
All of them.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.620
The whole team.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.820
This match is a propaganda stunt
for the Germans.

42:54.900 --> 42:57.540
It's a wonderful opportunity for us.

42:57.820 --> 42:58.820
But why send me?

42:58.900 --> 43:01.180
The French may have thought
of all this themselves.

43:01.220 --> 43:03.540
Indeed they may, and then again,
they may not.

43:03.660 --> 43:05.900
We have to get word to them somehow.

43:14.140 --> 43:15.500
What do you want me to do?

43:15.580 --> 43:17.620
Find out if an escape is feasible.

43:17.820 --> 43:18.900
Ask them to try it.

43:18.980 --> 43:20.020
If they won't?

43:20.100 --> 43:21.220
They won't.

43:21.820 --> 43:24.660
But they'd help you
to get to Spain or Switzerland.

43:30.580 --> 43:32.180
I suppose I could do that.

43:32.780 --> 43:33.940
Wonderful.

43:34.380 --> 43:37.420
-Thank you.
-I'll go over the details with you tonight.

43:37.700 --> 43:39.860
-Not a word to Colby.
-He'll have to know something.

43:39.940 --> 43:42.420
He'll have to know you're going,
but not why.

43:48.060 --> 43:49.780
I really don't believe this.

43:49.820 --> 43:50.820
What?

43:54.700 --> 43:56.940
This frigging game is wrecking my life.

44:00.020 --> 44:01.140
Good luck.

44:29.420 --> 44:30.660
Red Cross.

44:50.780 --> 44:52.940
-Good?
-Good.

45:38.620 --> 45:40.100
All the best, Hatch.

45:40.700 --> 45:42.180
I hope he makes it.

47:30.660 --> 47:32.260
Stay close to it. Easy.

47:32.780 --> 47:33.860
Easy.

47:49.820 --> 47:51.620
Achtung. Achtung.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.500
Lights out.

47:55.900 --> 47:57.380
Lights out.

51:39.740 --> 51:42.700
That was a wonderful evening, darling.

51:53.620 --> 51:56.140
See you tomorrow. Sleep well.

52:26.940 --> 52:28.180
Open the gate.

53:12.220 --> 53:13.780
For Paris, please.

53:16.540 --> 53:18.500
You must change in Strasbourg.

53:26.060 --> 53:28.020
Come on! We must go. Hurry up!

53:32.660 --> 53:34.100
All aboard, please.

53:37.180 --> 53:39.460
What is the purpose of your trip?

53:41.020 --> 53:43.020
Do you speak French?

53:44.700 --> 53:46.260
-Don't you speak German?
-No.

53:46.340 --> 53:48.540
I'm going to a funeral in Paris.

53:51.340 --> 53:53.180
I'm going to a funeral.

53:56.220 --> 53:57.980
My dear, wait.

55:58.460 --> 56:00.300
Quetsche, s'il vous plait.

56:08.380 --> 56:09.300
Merci.

56:20.060 --> 56:21.180
Alors, salut.

56:28.060 --> 56:29.140
Un autre.

56:29.380 --> 56:30.420
Oui.

56:51.420 --> 56:53.940
We don't even know
when or how they'll do the transfer.

56:53.980 --> 56:56.060
'Cause the Germans
could take them one by one.

56:56.140 --> 56:58.860
It all seems risky to me.

56:58.940 --> 57:03.140
Well, I don't know. It seems too soon
to make a decision like that. Tell him.

57:06.700 --> 57:07.780
Mister...

57:08.140 --> 57:09.620
...the answer is "no."

57:10.420 --> 57:11.900
That's what I figured.

57:13.020 --> 57:15.060
We do not know
where they would stay in Paris...

57:15.100 --> 57:17.700
...and I do not want a battle in the streets.

57:17.820 --> 57:21.820
The Germans will have a whole battalion
at least at the Colombes Stadium.

57:22.020 --> 57:23.460
The Colombes Stadium?

57:23.740 --> 57:25.900
Why didn't you say so before?

57:26.180 --> 57:29.020
My friends, the Paris sewer system
branches off just below...

57:29.100 --> 57:31.100
...the foundations of the stadium.

57:31.900 --> 57:33.620
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.180
Did I not work in the sewers 20 years ago?

57:35.260 --> 57:36.780
What'd he say?

57:37.340 --> 57:39.780
There were sewers there,
sewers going into the Seine.

57:39.860 --> 57:41.580
It's covered over now.

57:42.700 --> 57:44.020
Who knows.

57:52.140 --> 57:54.260
We will have a look. Okay? Bonsoir.

57:54.340 --> 57:55.540
What am I supposed to do?

57:55.580 --> 57:57.300
You will stay with Renee, please.

57:57.380 --> 57:59.780
The house is safe. Okay? Goodbye.

58:01.100 --> 58:02.180
Salut.

58:05.660 --> 58:07.380
-Bye, Renee.
-Good night.

58:23.700 --> 58:25.620
Thanks. No. Merci.

58:28.740 --> 58:30.740
Look, lady, I just said thanks.
No offense.

58:30.780 --> 58:32.980
We are both on the same side, aren't we?

58:33.180 --> 58:34.260
Please.

58:34.900 --> 58:35.980
I just wanted to talk.

58:36.060 --> 58:38.660
It's been a long time
since I talked to a woman.

58:39.740 --> 58:42.740
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Parlez-vous English?

58:43.100 --> 58:44.820
I understand you very well.

58:45.580 --> 58:47.540
Good. Then why don't you sit down
and we'll talk.

58:47.660 --> 58:49.500
Hatch. My friends call me Hatch.

58:49.580 --> 58:50.540
No.

58:51.660 --> 58:53.100
You don't want to be my friend?

58:53.180 --> 58:54.820
I didn't want to hear your name.

58:54.900 --> 58:58.140
And now that I do, I don't want to hear
anything else about you.

58:58.220 --> 58:59.980
The less I know, the better it is for you.

59:00.060 --> 59:01.340
And for you?

59:01.500 --> 59:02.860
And for me, too.

59:03.500 --> 59:05.500
My bein' here has put you
and your friends in a tough spot.

59:05.580 --> 59:06.740
Is that why you're mad?

59:06.780 --> 59:07.860
I'm not mad.

59:08.660 --> 59:12.180
But being in a tough spot,
as you call it, is where I choose to be.

59:12.420 --> 59:14.700
How do you feel about me being here?

59:15.060 --> 59:16.380
How do I feel?

59:16.780 --> 59:18.980
I feel responsible, hopeful.

59:19.980 --> 59:22.780
When I get word that someone
I sheltered is safe, then I'm happy.

59:22.820 --> 59:24.380
I can forget them.

59:25.020 --> 59:27.780
But when I hear
that they've been caught or killed...

59:27.860 --> 59:29.980
...then I remember everything.

59:31.100 --> 59:33.460
I remember their faces, their voices.

59:34.340 --> 59:37.780
What they said about their parents,
their child, their pets.

59:38.460 --> 59:40.300
And I mourn for them.

59:41.140 --> 59:43.020
I don't want to mourn for you.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.620
Well, you're safe with me, Renee.

59:46.020 --> 59:47.060
How?

59:47.820 --> 59:50.700
Well, I'm an orphan. A bastard.

59:51.340 --> 59:54.180
I have no parents.
No money. I'm not married.

59:54.580 --> 59:56.660
No children. I don't even have a pet.

59:56.700 --> 01:00:00.780
And anything I might say in my sleep
to the contrary can't be held against me.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.940
Do you live here alone?

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:04.020
No.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.540
Are you married?

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.980
He got killed, the first week of the war.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.860
Sorry.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.620
Who do you live with?

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.940
With Francois.

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.580
Is that your boyfriend?

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:20.420
It's late. I'll have him move out
of his room so you can sleep there.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.340
Wait.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.180
You don't have to get Francois up.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.620
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I can sleep here on the couch.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.180
My son, Francois.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.060
Herr Kommandant.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.700
The American's escape
has put me in a very bad position...

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.140
...with the Kommandant
and the high command.

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.860
Hatch's escape had nothing to do
with my team.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.540
That was his own idea.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.740
Your men covered for him.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.100
What would you expect them to do?

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.500
What would you do?

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.580
I want your word that there'll be
no attempt to escape from the team.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.500
Scouts' honor.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.180
The idea of the match was friendly.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.100
That was the idea.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.140
I want your word.

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.860
I can't give it to you.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:14.220
You will all be very closely guarded.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.500
All right.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.420
And down the sewer here we discovered
a foundation pipe of the stadium.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.300
Sounds good to me.

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:30.380
But...

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.500
...we must make sure which one it is.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.260
We have to find the original plans.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.180
We think the best chance to escape...

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.700
...will be from the visitors' dressing room.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.300
Maybe they'll be left alone at halftime.

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.340
Maybe.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:49.860
But we can run into a concrete wall.
Anything can happen.

01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.900
You will have to go back.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:01.940
What?

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.660
To the camp.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.020
To tell them.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:06.820
The team.

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.860
They must know that we'll be there.

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.020
It took me a year to get out of there.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.460
We need a contact.

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:16.580
Colby must know, and also your colonel.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.140
That's not my problem.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.340
You believe that?

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.060
I don't know what to believe.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.180
I don't. I mean....

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.580
What am I supposed to do?
Break back into the camp?

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.140
No. You get captured.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.580
Get captured.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.620
All right, suppose I get captured?

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.180
Then they send me to the wrong
prisoner camp. What about that?

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.340
-No, no.
-Now, what about that?

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.900
The Germans will take you
to the same place...

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.140
...to show the other prisoners
that you are not a success.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.820
You got all the answers, don't you?

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.820
Yes.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.460
Mister, you will leave tomorrow.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.220
-Tomorrow?
-Yes, tomorrow.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.460
This friggin' soccer game.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.740
I'll leave you my papers.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.420
They're pretty good.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.820
I'm sure somebody will be able to use 'em.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.740
All right?

01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.260
He's back.

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:04.500
Schnell.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.700
Thank you.

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.700
March, march.

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.780
So, our Hatch knows his mythology.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.820
What does it mean?

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.500
Mercury.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:26.820
Messenger of the gods.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.780
No flies on Rosey.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.060
News, eh?

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.300
How do we find out what it is?

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.020
Good question.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.100
We sent him to Paris on your behalf.

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.540
Yours and the team's.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:47.940
Colonel...

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.740
...l don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.780
We sent him to Paris
to arrange your escape.

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.700
-Hatch did that for you?
-No.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.580
-For you.
-We could argue about that.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.460
Why didn't you tell me?

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.260
No point, really,
unless he managed to arrange something.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.420
He appears to have been successful.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.900
The snag is he can't tell us.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.020
He'll be in the cooler until after the match.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.980
Then you'll just have to get him
out of there, won't you?

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.220
Excuse me.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.460
I have a training session.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.220
Just a minute. Colby....

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.860
I know you wanted to play for the sake
of those Eastern Europeans.

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:23.380
I admire you for it.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:27.500
But you and I both know that you risk
a court martial for this after the war.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.300
What have you accomplished?

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.140
Give them a couple of weeks of life?

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:34.220
And what is going to happen to them
after your match is over?

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.980
For the same reason
that you wanted to play you must escape.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.700
If you can.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.460
What can I do?

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.380
I can't get him out of there.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.540
Now, Hatch is officially your trainer,
isn't he?

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.940
Von Steiner and the camp Kommandant
won't buy that one.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.820
You'll have to think of something else.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.380
Crazy Yank.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.300
You, Colonel Waldron and Major Rose...

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.420
...will travel to Paris along with
other senior officers from various camps...

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.380
...to represent your countries.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.660
I won't do it.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.500
You have no choice.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.979
Then I'll travel...

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.859
...but I won't represent anything.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.420
You will be seen.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.740
The team...

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.819
...will be ready to travel at midday
on Thursday.

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:48.380
Further arrangements
will be announced later.

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:50.779
One of my men is
in the punishment block.

01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:52.020
In solitary.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.340
I can give you a trainer.
You don't need him.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.020
Hatch is my goalkeeper.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.540
The American? No.

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:00.740
Tony Lewis is your goalkeeper.

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:02.220
He's broken his arm.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.300
When did this happen?

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.300
This morning.

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.819
Put someone else in goal.

01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:11.460
Hatch is my best man.

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.819
I thought the idea was
to give us a chance.

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:16.340
This is the idea.

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:24.620
If the camp doctor verifies
this broken arm...

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.899
...you may have the American.

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.220
Thank you.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.340
Well, Tony?

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:39.100
Try and make it a clean break, will ya?

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.939
I'll try.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.700
I won't even get to see the game, will l?

01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:46.300
Sit on the bed.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:49.819
Put your arm between those two.

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.300
Okay.

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:24.220
-Are you going to put those up?
-Yes, sir.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.020
Which is the team for home?

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.620
Then the prisoners shall have it.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.180
We'll have the other.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.500
-The other is the same?
-Yes, sir.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.740
Good.

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:16.180
Colby, I don't know
how to play this game, so...

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.580
...where do I stand for the corner kick?

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.620
What?

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.980
I said, I'm not very good at the game.
Where do I stand for the corner kick?

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.460
Go to sleep, Hatch.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.980
Excuse me.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.900
Colby?

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.180
What?

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.740
Where do I stand for a corner kick?

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.340
The far post, facing the ball.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.780
Thanks. For a while there,
I thought you were keeping it a secret.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.180
Mesdames et messieurs.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.180
So, a hearty welcome
to all our listeners in England.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:54.980
There are just a few minutes to go
before the kickoff of this historic match.

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:58.700
This great crowd of about 50,000
really has something to look forward to...

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.660
...during the next 90 minutes.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.380
To insure fair play
and good sportsmanship...

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.940
...the German organizers have picked
a neutral to referee the match.

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:08.700
And he is now ready...

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.220
...for the toss of the coin.

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:10.740
Heads.

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:13.380
The winner will have his choice
of kicking off or defending.

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.140
But will most probably choose to play
towards the east goal...

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.020
...with the wind in his favor.

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.420
And the Allies will kick off
this great event.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.940
Well, I tell you, years from now
men will say of this game:

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.260
"Did it happen?"

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:30.140
Well, I tell you in the listening audience:
Today, it is happening.

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.340
We're all witness to an occasion
long to be remembered.

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.540
Not just propaganda, as some would say...

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:38.180
...but as a magnificent sporting spectacle.

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.620
Hatch.

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:54.300
Hatch. Halftime.

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:55.820
All right. Thanks.

01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:57.900
What'd he say?

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.740
That it's on for halftime.

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.340
Here's to victory.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.620
Let's go. Let's play ball.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.820
Play hard, eh?

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.220
Let's play hard.

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.140
Harmer kicks off for the Allies...

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:29.660
...and the game has begun.

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.020
You'd have a job getting...

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:34.220
...twenty-two better players than are
out there on the pitch right now.

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.380
The Allies are playing it very cool.

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.660
And Pauls of Denmark
makes it deep and shoots.

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.020
Very close.

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.860
The ball is back in play by Schmidt,
Germany's legendary goalkeeper.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:52.260
Reinhart, Reinhart to Becker...

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.340
...to Baumann, Number 4...

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:55.900
...forward now to Brandt...

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.620
...back to Albrecht, Number 11 .

01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.340
Albrecht out to the left.

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.260
He beats Number 4.

01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.940
-Watch him.
-Watch my back, watch my back.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:07.900
Watch out, Hatch.

01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.180
There's your corner kick, Hatch.

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.500
-The guy drove me out.
-To the right, to the right.

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.940
Watch him back there. Watch him.

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:26.940
Watch him, watch him there.

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.620
Come on, lads, eye on the ball. Come on.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.220
-Now, pick him up.
-Come on, guys.

01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:34.940
I got it.

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.140
It's a goal.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:41.340
Germany one, the Allies nil.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.860
And listen to that applause.

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:52.180
The crowd is going wild.

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.980
Take it easy. You're as tight as a drum.

01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:00.940
-Just give it to halftime, Colby.
-Don't let them pull you off your line.

01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.340
That's a foul.

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:12.820
Watch him.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:15.380
Come on. Stick with it. That's it.

01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:17.420
That's it. Come on.

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.380
Referee, look at this.

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:23.620
Get it out.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:24.820
Watch him back there. Watch him.

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.260
Play the ball.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.700
Germany two, Allies nil.

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.380
Come out, Hatch.

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.020
Don't lose your temper. It's okay.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.700
Everybody, out. Out! Out!

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:35.540
Take it.

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:20.180
Bravo.

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.140
Come on, Luis.

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:31.380
In the penalty area.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:34.500
The referee will probably call a penalty.
And he does.

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.380
This is the fella here. This is the one.

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.860
I'll calm my team, but you calm them.

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:51.660
The referee trying to settle them down,
and the call will remain.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.380
It will be a penalty kick, one on one.

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.300
Hatch, the goalkeeper...

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:01.020
...he'll have to be on his line,
that's 12 yards away.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:04.820
He's not allowed to move
until the ball has been struck.

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:09.260
Yes, indeed. Germany's great Baumann
will take the kick.

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.180
Goal. He sends the ball past Hatch.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:35.100
And it's three to nothing
in favor of Germany.

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:54.300
The Allies kick off again. It's Ray.

01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:57.260
Ray to Fernandez. Fernandez back to Ray.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.420
And we have seen
some very good football.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.660
Very fortunate for us, indeed,
considering that...

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.900
...there are no international games
being played now.

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.020
Baumann makes a beautiful tackle.

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.060
Dispossesses him, and the Germans
are again on the attack.

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:14.580
Watch your back, watch your back.

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.940
I'll get it.

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.180
It's good.

01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.260
Goal for the Germans.

01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:30.460
Four, nil.

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.020
Stay on the bloody line, I told you.

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:36.940
I missed.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.380
Stay on the line
and narrow the angle down.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.740
When they come in, narrow the angle.

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:33.220
We'll play ten men.
I'll go forward, you cover that back.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.180
This isn't going to be easy.

01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:46.740
We've taken enough, mates.
Let's get 'em.

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:48.980
The Allies are playing with ten men.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:53.460
Interesting, because Colby has chosen
to give this advantage to the Germans.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.340
Good. On you go, come on.

01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.140
Get it out.

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:44.340
Referee, look at--

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.260
Keep playing it, lads.

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.260
Four to one, and less than a minute
to go to the halftime.

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:22.100
This kind of action takes me back
to the World Cup of '38...

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:24.860
...played right here
in Colombes Stadium in Paris.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.940
We did it. We made it.

01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.540
The end of 45 minutes of play.

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:43.140
And it's been a brilliant first half.

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.580
I don't know about you,
but I can say for myself....

01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:54.900
Well done, lads.

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.660
Hatch, we got you to halftime.

01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:03.140
Let's see.

01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.300
Fantastic, Terry. At least we put up a--

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.740
-We scored a goal.
-Oh, yeah?

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.940
-Who scored?
-Terry scored a goal.

01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.660
Fantastic. What's the score?

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:18.740
Four to one. But at least
we scored a goal, one time.

01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.020
We're doin' good. It's gonna be all right.

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:26.420
Way to go, guys.

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.220
What's happening?

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:51.700
All right, we're getting out of here.

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:52.900
How?

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.980
Our escape has been arranged
all the way to the Seine River.

01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:58.260
Once we get on the other side,
we're gonna blow the tunnel.

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:01.180
There's a boat waiting for us
and in one hour we'll be in the country.

01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.260
All right?

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.620
Salut.

01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:26.580
Vite. Vite.

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:30.100
Vite. Vite. Vite.

01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:32.300
Colby, you take the lead off,
I'll bring up the rear.

01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.140
Okay. Get Luis and Pieter.

01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.500
-I don't want to go.
-Just shut up and get in there.

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.100
We can beat them.

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.580
Bring Pieter over.

01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:40.780
We've still got a chance.

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:42.380
Chance, my ass.

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:43.700
Hatch, don't you see?

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:45.660
You nuts or somethin'?
You have no chance.

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.580
Don't you understand? No chance.

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.140
Get Pieter ready next.

01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:54.740
Hey.

01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:56.180
Come on, let's go.

01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:58.140
Don't worry. Come on. Hurry.

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:02.100
I don't want to go.
Let's go back. We can win this.

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.260
-Who said that?
-I did.

01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:04.980
It's not as though
we're being slaughtered, Skipper.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.820
What do you mean, we can win?

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:09.580
-Wait a minute.
-Colby, we're losin' time.

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:11.500
You mean you'd go back
and play the second half?

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.140
Move. We've only got a few minutes.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.180
Yes, but we could win this.

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:15.740
You could never, with me as the goal.

01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.660
Of course, we can.
He's not a bad goalie, is he?

01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:19.460
What's the matter with you?
You want to go back to prison?

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:20.820
-Come back, we need you.
-That's right.

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:22.380
You guys do what you want,
but I'm leavin'.

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.180
-You're quitting.
-I ain't goin' back to prison.

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:26.460
You've got to come back. If you don't--

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.140
-I waited too long to get out.
-If you don't come back, we can't go.

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.860
Hatch, if you go,
we've all got to go with you.

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.940
We can't go back without the goalie.

01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:35.540
-Hatch, come on.
-Hatch.

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.380
Please, Hatch.

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.460
That game means a lot to us.

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:40.700
You know that.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:41.900
You must go back.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:43.660
-Hatch, let's go.
-Please.

01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:45.660
We can win.

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.180
Come on.

01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:50.500
If we run now, we lose more than a game.

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:52.340
Please, Hatch.

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.740
Good luck, Hatch. Good luck.

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.620
Come on, lads, let's get 'em.

01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:09.780
The Allies are playing above themselves.

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.860
Throwing everything into
a desperate attack.

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.420
Very quickly the Allies have come back
with a goal.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.060
And it's four to two.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:49.860
Come on, run with it.

01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:53.260
Right tackle, Roy.

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:11.500
Fifteen minutes remaining
of this incredible game...

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.700
...and you won't see many
better than this.

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.020
A marvelous game.

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:55.420
We anticipated it, and so far, it's a sizzler.

01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.300
The Germans are in top form.

01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:56.140
Get lost.

01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:58.140
Get me in there. Break fast.

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:25.940
The goal has been disallowed. No goal.

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.300
The goal has been disallowed.

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:30.220
What do you mean, no goal?

01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:32.820
That's a bloody lie.

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:39.660
That's a bloody lie.
All right lads, we've been had.

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.980
This game has had all the drama.

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:44.460
An equalizing goal not allowed...

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:47.780
...so the Allies are still behind
three goals to four.

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.900
I want to play.

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.380
-You can't play like that.
-I feel good. I feel better.

01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:57.740
-I must play.
-Ref, he's coming back on.

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:08.180
I'm okay.

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:10.460
...into the football festival
and only four minutes remaining.

01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:12.700
-All right, lads, let's go.
-They're all very crucial.

01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:15.580
The Germans are powerful,
and very strong.

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:49.380
Stick with him, boy.

01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.180
Victory. Victory.

01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:15.300
Victory. Victory.

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.900
Victory. Victory.

01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:22.700
Victory. Victory.

01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.740
Victory. Victory.

01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:26.860
Victory. Victory.

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:28.900
Victory. Victory.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:32.860
Victory. Victory.

01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:34.900
Victory. Victory.

01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.580
Victory. Victory.

01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:44.940
And so we're ready to pick up
where we left off in the action.

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.340
Very good, keep going.

01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:10.900
And Schmidt, one of the best goalkeepers
in the world...

01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:13.780
...showing us again
that he's not lost any of his skills.

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.780
About a minute remaining.

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:18.820
Schmidt left foots it down the field.

01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:21.380
The Germans have a lovely ball.

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:24.540
It's Baumann. Baumann is...

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:27.380
...brought down in the penalty area.

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:30.140
The referee responds and rightfully so.

01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:33.140
A deliberate foul by Ray
as the clock runs out.

01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:34.900
And the penalty collects.

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:44.620
And at the very end of the game
they've resorted to fouling.

01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.980
What a sad way to end this game.

01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:49.020
This is not fair.

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.580
Come on, Hatch. Come on.

01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.060
Victory. Victory.

01:46:07.305 --> 01:46:13.193
