11:19.320 --> 11:21.891
There would be only one thing:

11:22.040 --> 11:26.204
I need you to ask for
anything a signature.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.841
He hits the center of the heart.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.083
His instrument is no more violin,

11:57.240 --> 12:00.528
it is a living entity,
the fear and sadness

12:00.680 --> 12:02.444
sobs and shudders

12:02.600 --> 12:07.083
Well, well. Above all,
he is a master conman.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.125
Let me see. He ​​must
return to the hairdresser.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.410
He learned to play in prison.
- What?

12:13.600 --> 12:17.161
His violin was the only he
possessed in solitary confinement.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.210
Its strings pulled one after another.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.728
He can play a concerto
only on the G string.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.727
Elizabeth, dear, that's impossible.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.162
Why was the thug locked up?

12:30.320 --> 12:34.689
They say he has his mistress
killed out of jealousy.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.046
Ah, you mean to tell
me this Italian rascal

12:39.400 --> 12:41.368
is my rival for your heart?

12:42.120 --> 12:46.011
Do not forget: You are
my lover, Elizabeth.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.003
I would immediately leave you for him.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.849
Do you like to do? Is your company?

13:03.440 --> 13:06.762

13:26.720 --> 13:29.724
I have an appointment here.
- With who?

13:29.880 --> 13:35.125
Personally with Lord Burghersh.
His lordship dined at the club.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.647
* It occurs in something. *

13:54.520 --> 13:56.807
Forgive me. Are you a club member?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.205
I'm here to talk to Lordsburg Hersh.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.966
And whom should I report?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.808
My card.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.603
Edwards.
- This is ridiculous.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.761
Everyone in London knows me
as an important impresario.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.605
Unfortunately Those are the rules, sir.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.368
My lord.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.410
I represent the greatest
violinists in the world

14:33.840 --> 14:36.241
No, thank you.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.163
From whom am I speaking?
- Every fool is known,

14:41.320 --> 14:43.527
that the greatest violinist Paganini is

14:43.880 --> 14:48.329
You are not a fool.
Lordsburg Hersh expect.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.207
Lordsburg Hersh, I
should introduce myself?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.250
I'm John Watson.
- Very pleased.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.808
But I'm busy.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.361
Forgive! my intrusion

15:01.560 --> 15:04.882
and the brazenness with
the I come before you.

15:05.040 --> 15:08.806
But I have to make a urgent proposal,

15:08.960 --> 15:13.090
Which liberate not only the
Opera House of the difficulties

15:13.200 --> 15:16.044
London but will meet with shine.

15:16.200 --> 15:20.205
After an introduction such
I would be really a goal,

15:20.360 --> 15:23.409
I did not listen to you.
- Thank you, my lord.

15:24.600 --> 15:29.322
I suggest to bring
Niccolo Paganini to London.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.763
To an exclusive concert series
at the Opera House to give.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.322
His fame and his virtuosity

15:35.520 --> 15:37.966
surpass anything what we know here.

15:38.280 --> 15:42.126
So that we at least 10
times had a sell out.

15:42.280 --> 15:46.205
The press is obsessed
by the Italian maestro.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.566

15:54.440 --> 15:56.966
I do not doubt, Mr. Watson.

15:57.400 --> 16:03.043
But I doubt your ability
to Paganini to get here.

16:03.680 --> 16:07.082
Dear Maestro Paganini.

Perfection.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.569

No mercy for rapists!

41:46.680 --> 41:48.682
No asylum

41:49.040 --> 41:52.442
Outside is the press and
the rabble of the other day.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.642
But we climb directly.

41:55.680 --> 41:59.162
No asylum for devil worshipers!
- Get in,.

42:00.640 --> 42:05.202
Is your appearance really
a guinea per square worth?

42:40.440 --> 42:43.683
Gentlemen, it sounds a bit cumbersome.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.682
It is not Beethoven.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.287
No, not sure.

42:54.040 --> 42:58.602
Could Signor Paganini not
honor us with a sample of

43:03.200 --> 43:05.282
The concertmaster has a Guarneri.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.842
I can see that too.

43:10.960 --> 43:14.885
Mr. Watson.
- Yes, Mr. er Signor Paganini.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.566
I have to interrupt.

Thank you.

43:57.680 --> 44:01.321
Sir, I do not care who you

44:01.920 --> 44:04.446
Mr. Paganini, what are you thinking?

44:05.000 --> 44:09.767
Three boxes sold for the
Fifth And five for the Ninth.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.366
Sparsely occupied parking. That was it.

44:12.880 --> 44:16.009
Dozens of journalists outside
my door. Day and night.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.721
Maybe it runs at the box office.

44:18.880 --> 44:21.565
Did you read the "Times"?
- Not today.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.202

44:31.200 --> 44:34.283
We've heard that until now

44:34.440 --> 44:36.727
only two boxes have been sold. "

44:36.880 --> 44:39.611
Who wrote the If I could

44:39.760 --> 44:42.286
Who ever you know it

44:43.720 --> 44:46.200
Miss Langharn

44:46.760 --> 44:49.366
This could help us out of trouble

44:49.560 --> 44:52.723
The royal seal? Around the palace

44:53.360 --> 44:56.330
I would also say, Mr. Watson

44:56.840 --> 45:01.129
Nothing brings more people to the theater
than the recommendation of the King

45:01.280 --> 45:03.931
Then I let play my magic powers

45:06.000 --> 45:09.641
Good day, gentlemen Signore Paganini

45:12.320 --> 45:15.290
Have you seen the seal
- Jaja

45:23.440 --> 45:25.329
..?.?.. And how much he pays

45:25.920 --> 45:29.891
It is an honor to play for
the King And good advertising

45:30.040 --> 45:33.522
With the greatest
respect and deep regret

45:33.680 --> 45:35.967
We have to turn down the invitation

45:36.520 --> 45:40.241
No, no
- But His Majesty offers

45:40.400 --> 45:43.802
a pretty box of honor
for our concert at.

45:44.160 --> 45:47.721
No, you do not understand.
You can not refuse.

45:47.880 --> 45:50.167
This is an invitation His Majesty.

45:50.560 --> 45:53.962
If it is His Majesty,
, he can pay the price.

45:54.120 --> 45:57.283
This is ridiculous!
We hardly sold tickets!

45:57.720 --> 46:00.724
Man accuses us, to ask absurd prices!

46:00.880 --> 46:03.884
And the're right! This is a disaster!

46:04.040 --> 46:09.046
If the theater is empty, does
not take place the concert.

46:11.800 --> 46:16.442
Corrupts the Youth, poisoned
souls destroyed life!

46:32.960 --> 46:35.008

47:04.440 --> 47:07.887
I think Mr. Watson wants me to stay.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.168
John Watson deserves more respect

47:10.320 --> 47:12.402
for his efforts to promote you.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.848
He should say myself.

47:38.800 --> 47:42.088
It's true what they say.
Your game sounds thin.

47:42.240 --> 47:46.882
It consists of showmanship
And Your music is trivial.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.646
You are a juggler. You do not practice.

47:49.960 --> 47:54.568
Because you do not want us to
see as second class you are.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.123
Do you remember when
we had our first concert

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.851
and our fabulous reviews?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.130
Yes, and I also know yet
exactly what is fit for it.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.722
Excuse me.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.010
Mr. Watson. The Maestro is a bit
sensitive on the day of the concert

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.811
It is not to annoy him the best.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.566
I have to congratulate him, Mr. Urbani.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.520
Signor Paganini, which was fabulous.
- Urbani, a coach.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.090
Do you want somewhere?
You come back yet, right?

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.847
The drive to the theater is six clock.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.765
There is oh so much traffic.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.807
* You talk at once. *

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.962
Did he say where he wants to go?

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:48.127
Did you hear her sing Charlotte?
- However.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.522
And?

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.404
For an unbiased ear it
sounds quite pleasing.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.607
That's it?

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.846
I am polite.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.045
Unwanted desires, by
the unscrupulous goings

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.647
to be incited the so-called virtuoso

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.727
as think of anything else
to their insatiable lust

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.282
And what has brought us?

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:02.729
The scourge of our age. The
evil scourge of epidemics.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:07.290
The self-indulgence has
brought upon us the plague.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.604
Get out of here! You should
come down to times correctly.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.048
The hard you'd regret it.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.285
Because I was brought by
such a charlatan basis.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:22.365
And just wore this disease in his body.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.087
My life is destroyed. Of
your yard not gone too.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:30.081
Can I destroy you again?
- Can you mean?

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.725
Oh, it would be my feast.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.800
Madam, I am pleased to see you again.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.169
Do I know you?
- We met in front of the Sablonniere.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.808
I cherish the greatest
sympathy for your cause

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.761
Thank you.
- Please, go a piece with me.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.926
Do me the honor a
conversation in private.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.846
* He whispers something. *

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.961
Lordsburg Hersh, sir.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.407
What an honor that you are here today.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.406
Let us listen to the
fiddling of Paganini.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.401
So, you are supplied. This is
good. Distributes you all a bit.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.649
Everyone gets a pin and a music book.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.603
Behave unremarkable. But
trying to take down everything.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.600
And if you can record everything

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.048
there will be a nice gift for you

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.640
I have to ask though!

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:40.041
So full it was never before.
Each lodge, occupied every seat.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.399
Apart from the royal box, of course.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.526
The I have kept for the king free.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.206
Waiting outside a lot. Do we sell it.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:54.410
If the king says he comes,
the courts must be free.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.922
Even if he changes his mind

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.090
He ​​is now 10 minutes late.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.408
Mr. Rogers, he's so far?

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.924
If I knew that.
- Then look after for heaven's sake.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:20.127
If he's ready.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.806
Yes, but how long does it take to yet?

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.409
Where is he?
- He is not there yet.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.762
He does not answer.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.403
What do I do now? A
Violin Violin Concerto no.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.806
(Chanting) Paganini!

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.602
On the stage with you. But
let yourself plenty of time.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.687
Not too fast. Not too fast.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.887
I can not play without him

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.567
He has never shown us the
notes for the solo voice.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.090
Break a leg. But let
yourselves this time.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.361
Enjoy.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.411
So, I has to get out now.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.446
You bring him here. I'm
begging you. Get him.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.327
Good luck.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.003
* Applause *

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.126
* you begin to play. *

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.361
Where is he? I've already

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.450
What's going on?
- Do not panic. He's in there.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.326
You already play. They
started with the overture.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.967
He is in there? You do
not want to be disturbed.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.323
What?
- You talk business.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.371
Business? He ​​has
to play a concert.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.847
Get him out.
- No. Impossible.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.285
The concert has begun.
I should let no one.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.647
No Niccolo!

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.241
Gently! Not at all.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.365
* You play. *

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.002
Silence.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.771
* Murmur in the audience *

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.682
yell. *

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.247
Screech from the audience '

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.526
Cheering and screaming *

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.686

* He plays a version
of "God Save the King *

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.810
I leave you my violin for six pence

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.966
From what I've heard,
I could no longer touch.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.968
Charlotte

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.408

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.929

Sings an aria for you now.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.210

Frenetic jubilation *

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.007
Bravo!

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:36.286
Apparently he is the new violin God.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:59.926
Excuse me.
- Please, I want to listen.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.529
I'm from the Times' I would
like to mention you praise

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.968
Oh
- May I ask a few questions

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.728
Of course, like

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:20.524
Madame Tussaud wants Paganini
likeness create wax?..

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.808
For a new figure Exhibition

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.122
In a room full of celebrities

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.806
it calls celebrities Cabinet

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.769
Very resourceful

Would you like to be portrayed

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.446
would be the very
exciting for a young girl.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.927
I had on something no claim.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.846
I just sang, because
the maestro asked me.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.324
What type exactly your
relationship to Paganini?

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:51.610
Please?
- Well, he is your music teacher?

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.010
Uh, no.
- But he lodges in your house.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.811
In my father's house, Miss
- Langharn.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.248
Ethel Langharn. You're how old again?

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.687
I did not say.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:06.566
Do you want to know something else

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.449
* Voices *

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.250
Caution! It will overwhelm you.
- Niccolo!

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.729
Niccolo!
- The ladies of the way.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.886
Charlotte!
- Niccolo!

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.443
Out of the way!
- Niccolo!

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.405
Way here!
- But where is Niccolo?

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:55.049
You can not wait. He
​​will send for you.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:01.166
Mr. Watson.
- Good evening, Mr. Urbani.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.005
The concert was excellent, is not it?

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.970
However. Have you seen my daughter?

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.090
Sure is enjoying her fame.
- Probably.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.722
We had a full house. You
did not want to believe me.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.726
We were successful, yes.
Could I have our share?

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.169
Well, it's late. We can
settle tomorrow clean.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.449
I have to find Charlotte
- Do not resent me,

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.087
if I ask you for immediate payment!

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.642
I have to collect everything.
You will then receive it.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.208
Is this your cut?

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.961
This must be fairly shared.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.566
I have to pay the orchestra

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:45.282
I understand. So we'll keep that.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:51.001
And we will divide, perfectly just,

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.243
if we do the billing.
- Good evening.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.691
Apologies. Excuse me, ladies.

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:03.444
I beg you. I have to get
in there Quiet. Calm down.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.167
He's not in there. Has
anyone seen Charlotte?

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.561
Miss Langharn, You look gorgeous.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.805
Signor Urbani, you are
as a fascinating man.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.930
I do not know I
supposed to restrain you.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.447
You are difficult to control.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.287
That would require a woman of your size.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.091
In whom you enter into temptation?

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:30.362
Wherever I am treated kindly.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.167
Miss Langharn, you liked the Maestro?

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.410
The pleasure was somewhat
marred to to be honest.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.921
What extent '?

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.364
Now, it was up to the girl I
thought they were pretty clueless.

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.409
She is young. It is How young exactly?

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.571
My lips are sealed.
- I had expected.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:20.286
High with you! I have a
suite reserved Sablonniere.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.570
Let us enjoy of your triumph.
- Not without Charlotte.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.248
She was stunning.

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.330
It would be unwise
arrive there with her.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.209
I let the young lady
align where to find us.

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.601
You were incredible.
- So what I've never heard of.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.727
Urbani. I can not bear all the people.

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:52.770
Send them away.
- As you wish, Maestro.

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.843
Where is Charlotte?

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.561
I have sent for her It
is determined on the go.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:07.844
You must now rely. The
Maestro needs to rest.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.363
Thank you. Waits. Can you stay?

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.524
Signor Urbani. Does your love to me?

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:25.089
No, no. It is not to my pleasure.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.443
The poor fellow thinks he was in love.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.885
A wretched condition. Of
which he must be weaned.

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:43.649
And who is the object of his desire

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.685
A young, pretty child.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.368
About Your stature, Your hair color.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.402
Signor Urbani. Your plan fascinates me.

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.566
She is a virgin.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.288
Maestro. She's here.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.845
Charlotte?

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:29.406
Charlotte.
- Love.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:05.160
Paganini's forbidden
love for a young girl.

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.684
Paganini's concert. His
forbidden love to a young girl.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.286
Read all about it. Is the number 11?

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.169
Yes.
- Charlotte Watson?

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.967
Yes.
- A letter from Signor Paganini.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.650
"Come quickly hotel
Sablonniere Suite 405

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.646
The newspaper reported today
of the shameful seduction

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.121
An innocent English girl

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:45.251
by foreigners Paganini.
She's still a child.

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.288
Can we sit idly

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.722
as such, hustle and
bustle corrupts our youth?

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:56.729
This music corrodes the
soul and destroyed our lives.

01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.848
This music decomposes the soul.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.568
Miss Watson.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.441
The Maestro's in there.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.409
I let him know that you are here

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.287
He is the same.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.648
Good morning.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.641
What is going on here?

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.811
Is this your business? I
want you never see her again!

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:22.762
Charlotte, wait!

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.803
As you wish
- Wait!

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.284
Charlotte, wait! Charlotte, stops!

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.284
Let me explain it.
- This is obsolete!

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.125
This is a mistake
- Who are you?

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.328
Why do you give yourself
from with Urbani?

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:45.321
He gives me the blood in the veins
freeze! Remains of the Body of me!

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:48.205
Wait!
- There is the innocent child.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.444
And here comes the seducer!

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.450
Do you see how shameless
he is after her?

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.366
He ​​has lured to his hotel!

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.404
She's broken and humiliated!

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.645
He has ruined them! Then he left them!

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:14.986
The wrath of the English people
to chase him out of our country!

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.728
Charlotte!
- We Spank his ass!

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.282
Charlotte! Charlotte!

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.280
Urbani! Urbani!

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.287
Urbani!

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.171
(Charlotte) Stop it!

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.048
Urbani! Italian scum!

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:50.085
Charlotte!
- Way here.

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.761
Let me explain it.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.363
Charlotte, let me explain.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.081
Please, I beg you I have nothing please.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.006
This is an outrage! This is an outrage!

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.607
Why do you imprison me? I am the victim!

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:23.366
It has attacked me for no reason!

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:34.323
Take care of him. He
​​raped a child.

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.087
What?
- That's not true.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.129
Lies!
- A Mädchenschänder.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.762
Lies.
- Oh yeah?

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.930
* Paganini screams in pain. *

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:52.169
An English girl to seduce.

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.522
Ah!

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.764
Charlotte.
- Papa!

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.123
Charlotte. It is, as you see, a lady.

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.203
As you can lock them up?

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.762
I am known. The press reports about me.

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:22.049
Come to me, my child,
out nothing happened.

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:30.406
How fast your are fallen from grace.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.083
Urbani.

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.968
I am ready to forgive
you your disloyalty.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.648
I prefer to let me beat a thousand times

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.164
Never again will I let
myself one with you.

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.688
My they have not really loved.

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.840
You loved this, what you saw in her.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.207
Your innocence.

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.811
Someone whose purity you
redeemed of your many sins.

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.046
But she's made of flesh and blood.

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.401
Likewise, sensual and
ambitious as you are.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:13.283
The upshot was predetermined.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.171
Your she would have destroyed.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:23.288
Corruption. With the
same glowing infection

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:26.808
seething in your blood.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.571
I am not the devil.

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.651
I serve the devil.

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.770
And you are my master.

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.642
The bottle shatters. *

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.881
Are you okay?

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:02.329
Do not you wanna maybe go to fresh air?

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.365
Paganini has made known, where he is.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.047
Where is he? Was in the newspaper

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.083
that he is going to Vienna.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.211
He has taken the first
ferry from Dover yesterday.

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.243
Come, my child.

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.847
Come here. It's all good.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.844
All good. Come here.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:37.850
Hello. Hello.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.325
Achilles. Achilles!

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.166
Achilles, I'm back!

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.849
It's so nice to see you again

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:52.166
I've missed you so.

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:55.770
You have so missed you,
my little Achillino.

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.002
How was your teacher?
- Strict.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:02.445
What have! learned? Mathematics?
- No, he hit me.

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.802
And he can not cook.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.646
Are you telling me the truth?

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:17.327
On guard!
- Oh, Maestro. Oh, Maestro.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.522
You hit my son?
- No.

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:22.843
You hit my son?
Disappears! Get out of here!

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.129
Power that your coming out! Get out!
- Maestro.

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.848
Charlotte, how are you?
Has Paganini wrote to you?

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.402
Will you see him again?
- Give an answer.

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:53.290
How can we end this lie?

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.164
Well. I could write a letter

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.922
Or we sue for libel. That
would cost 500 pounds.

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:07.886
We do not even five
pounds. To mention 500 full

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.611
We should live with it.
- To live?

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.090
I'm not Paganini whore.
- We know that, my child.

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:18.524
We could consider as advertising.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:22.446
What?
- The hardest thing for an artist

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:25.007
is to make his name known

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.649
Yours is just across London known.

01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.731
You'll famous. Perhaps is
reported even in New York.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:36.282
In this way, I want to not be known.

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:39.809
See how you can use the thing.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:42.964
Attempt to make the best of it

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.171
You think of me speaks only envy.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:51.364
But I know what it is,
miss an opportunity.

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:55.931
One that will never happen again
under certain circumstances.

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.443
What do you mean, Dad?

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:04.880
Hm, Paganini is as famous as Napoleon

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.366
Of this falls something from you.

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:13.925
We could arrange for you solo concerts.

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:24.006
Such messages are quickly forgotten.

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.049
"Dearest Charlotte,
because the excitement

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.851
laid to our last meeting

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.800
I could persuade you,
to rethink our situation

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:11.524
and to accompany me on a
concert tour on the continent

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.366
If we spend more time
and get to know us better

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:18.689
I hope you can give me confidence.

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:23.289
For I feel, between us is love.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.243
In order to secure my future,

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.523
I opened the 'Casino Paganini " in Paris

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:34.890
It is a noble Konzerthaus
with games and reading rooms

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.930
If your kämt, would be a fabulous place

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.760
for your debut in Paris

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:50.445
There is not a day that I do not myself

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.802
yearn after your loving glance

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:55.725
After living, that you radiate,

01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:58.121
that fills me with hope

01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:02.080
The feeling in me is
stronger than I can bear it

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.050
It is completely new to me

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:08.727
I implore you, to recognize my sincerity

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:14.250
and to believe me that I
am you totally submissive. "

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.850
(Charlotte) Dear Niccolo,
your offer has touched me.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.526

where I give a series of concerts

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.968
Without your inspiration it
would never have happened.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.362
You are the greatest violinist

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:38.450

consolation to you at
the loss of a mortal. "

You have all invested in
the success of this company

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.527
You have no choice

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:08.720

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.047
You will not come.

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.841
You will not come. Because of you.

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.522
Here. I assure you, Maestro

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:51.127
they will not come, even if I go.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.125
The concert will be a success.
- Yes.

The casino also.
- Mhm.

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.567
Charlotte will come.

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:34.643
All Paris will talk about us.

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.206
I'm done with you.

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.731
This time This time I'm serious.

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:03.407
You can not survive
without me, Maestro.

As you wish.

Until we meet again, Maestro.

"Dearest Charlotte

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:51.003
I deliver myself from
another time your grace.

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.164
I have Urbani dismissed and stand here

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:58.848
as your servant, who is
eagerly waiting for a response

I have since our last correspondence

* Laughter *

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.571
* They speak French. *

01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:58.967
Where can we find Paganini?

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.966
I suspect he has fled from my complaint.

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:06.085
* He speaks Italian. *

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.525
Nice to be back in Italy.

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:25.206
Yes, Papa. Herrlich.

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.602
"Love Charlotte

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:45.206
I left Paris towards Genoa

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:49.331
Where I bought a house, withdraw to me.

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.922
The concert tour is finally over.

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.642
What with so much hope began

01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:58.371
and so incomparably
successful, there was

01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:01.211
ends with lasting fame.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.241
But I have scars suffered,

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.801
that will never heal.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.811
Although I have conquered Europe,

01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:15.409
but with the profit I
can buy me no health.

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:18.843
Not even satisfaction.

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:23.360
But now that I have time,
I'll take my solo voices

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.528
concerts and write,

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.288
so that future
generations can try it... "

* The priest speaks Italian *
- Get out of here

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.162
Get out of here!

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:57.120
I'm healthy. For this
I pray with God's grace.

01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:01.160
But you must not squander
the salvation of your soul.

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:05.120
(Laughs) God's grace.
- Confession! Your sins.

01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:09.331
I'll tell you something
about God's grace.

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:11.602
God's grace.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.881
Your God.

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:17.681
He has left me.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.842
* She sings in Italian. *

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.004
He ​​has given me a gift.

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:27.003
And then left me in a world alone,

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:30.687
has not understood this gift.

01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:33.642
Get out of here.

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.970
* He speaks Italian. *

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:42.449
I will defeat him.

01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:51.321
I will

01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:55.090
I will live forever.

01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:11.089
* She sings in Italian. *

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:11.569
* She sings in Italian. *

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.163
Frenetic jubilation *

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:41.964
The church forbid Paganini
to be buried in Geweither soil

01:55:45.965 --> 01:55:49.965
Achilles the pope decreed to revoke

01:55:53.966 --> 01:55:57.266
all recognition.
