00:06.660 --> 00:10.219
This estate's been a good home to us,
me, Frank Gallagher, and my kids,

00:10.720 --> 00:16.318
who I'm proud of, cos every one of
them reminds me a little of...me.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.919
They can all think for themselves,
which they've me to thank for.

00:21.020 --> 00:25.019
Lip, bit of a gobshite, which is why
nobody calls him Philip any more.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.939
Ian, a lot like his mam,
which was handy for the others

00:27.940 --> 00:30.459
when she disappeared into thin air.

00:30.460 --> 00:33.619
And Carl, we daren't let him grow
his hair for two reasons -

00:33.620 --> 00:37.299
it makes it stand on end and makes
him look Toyah, and nits love it.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.819
Debbie! Sent by God.

00:39.820 --> 00:43.619
Total angel. You've to check your
change, but she'll go miles

00:43.620 --> 00:45.499
out of her way to do you a favour.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.499
Plus lickle Ian -
he's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.499
Monica - the wife.
She's back - with her bird in tow.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.059
And we can't get shot off her.

00:56.060 --> 00:58.099
And the neighbours -

00:58.100 --> 01:01.979
the neighbours!
Well, what can you say?

01:01.980 --> 01:04.138
Nothing, if you don't
want your arms breaking.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.819
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:05.820 --> 01:09.619
But all of them, to a man,
know first and foremost one

01:09.620 --> 01:13.619
of the most vital necessities in life
is - they know how to throw a party!

01:16.260 --> 01:17.259
Scatter!

01:21.500 --> 01:23.659
'Normally, poems are shite.

01:23.660 --> 01:26.299
'Shakespeare and Woolworth,
and all them.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.459
'But we've got this one at school
that says, "they fuck you up,

01:29.460 --> 01:31.259
'"your mum and your dad."

01:31.260 --> 01:35.259
'It's the first poem
I ever agreed with.'

01:35.260 --> 01:37.659
'Your parents are
supposed to help you.

01:37.660 --> 01:39.739
'But they don't.
They say it's cos of

01:39.740 --> 01:43.739
'pressures of modern living,
but that's bollocks.'

01:44.140 --> 01:48.059
Come along, lad, don't dilly-dally.
The Good Lord has provided.

01:48.060 --> 01:52.059
Gosh,
I'll have some of that, Father!

01:52.220 --> 01:53.859
Me, too, it looks ripping!

01:53.860 --> 01:56.939
No, you don't, you two chaps,
not till Carl has had his fill.

01:56.940 --> 01:58.939
He's our pride and joy.

01:58.940 --> 02:02.339
'If this is how it's supposed to be,
it wouldn't be half-bad.'

02:02.340 --> 02:04.859
You wanna be careful
what you wish for, Carl.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.019
Where have you been
all my life, doll face?

02:08.020 --> 02:11.819
Fuck me, if it isn't
the wife's lesbian lover!

02:11.820 --> 02:14.419
'But look at the state of us.
How is this a family?

02:14.420 --> 02:17.699
'They do fuck you up, your mum
and your dad, and I hate it!'

02:17.700 --> 02:20.499
You're like a walking
lobotomy sometimes, Carl.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.379
Pot, kettle, black - don't knock it
till you've tried it, goofy.

02:24.380 --> 02:25.939
What's he doing up?

02:25.940 --> 02:29.259
He hasn't been to bed. Even he'd
struggle getting drunk this early.

02:29.260 --> 02:31.939
Who are you, one of Tony Blair's
thought police,

02:31.940 --> 02:34.539
monitoring the behaviour of your
parents

02:34.540 --> 02:36.819
so you can report them to
Esther fuckin' Rantzen?

02:36.820 --> 02:38.859
Couldn't drop us a tenner,
could you?

02:38.860 --> 02:40.739
You must be joking, I'm brassy.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.379
We're out of milk, and
she's down to her last nappy.

02:43.380 --> 02:46.539
Welcome to my world.
It's all take, take, take, isn't it?

02:46.540 --> 02:48.419
Morning!

02:48.420 --> 02:51.459
Debs...No.

02:51.460 --> 02:52.139
Come on, Liam.

02:52.140 --> 02:55.459
That's right. Run off to school,
dessert the sinking ship.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.779
Let lickle Katie
piss all over herself.

02:57.780 --> 03:00.659
Dob your parents in for
reading the wrong books.

03:00.660 --> 03:03.419
You flogged every book we ever had.

03:03.420 --> 03:06.539
I should have kept the one
on contraception, shouldn't I?

03:06.540 --> 03:07.619
See you later.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.219
You haven't had any breakfast.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.179
(FRANK) Good, sell the toast.

03:11.180 --> 03:15.179
Buy little Katie a nappy.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.699
All right, chicken?

03:20.700 --> 03:24.699
Haven't you forgotten something?

03:33.020 --> 03:37.019
My giro! She's took my fuckin' giro!

03:37.940 --> 03:41.139
Debs! Debbie! >

03:41.140 --> 03:42.579
No joy.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.139
Go next door and try.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.619
We're not going to
your mum and dad's.

03:45.620 --> 03:48.379
They are my family. Katie needs...

03:48.380 --> 03:49.419
I know!

03:49.420 --> 03:52.139
I know!
BABY CRIES

03:52.140 --> 03:56.139
I know.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.619
I'll sort something.
We agreed.

04:02.620 --> 04:06.099
If we can't make it
on our own without your family,

04:06.100 --> 04:09.579
what's the point?

04:09.580 --> 04:12.059
I'll fix it.

04:12.060 --> 04:16.059
I promise.

04:21.380 --> 04:25.379
Where's Prince Charming?

04:25.620 --> 04:29.619
Off somewhere,
doing something, I don't know.

04:34.060 --> 04:38.059
Happy birthday, bird.

04:42.140 --> 04:43.259
You remembered.

04:43.260 --> 04:47.059
I always do.
Did none of them?

04:47.060 --> 04:51.059
Not a single one.

04:56.460 --> 04:59.739
Everybody hates me!

04:59.740 --> 05:03.739
Oh... Come here.

05:10.780 --> 05:13.179
This is a waste of time.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.899
If we catch the Maguires in the act,
then the crime rate

05:15.900 --> 05:17.739
will go through the floor.

05:17.740 --> 05:21.739
We're hardly inconspicuous,
though, are we? They're not stupid.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.659
Didn't you bring any cups?

05:24.660 --> 05:27.219
Carrie?They're in the bottom.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.979
Why would she be packing your bag?

05:28.980 --> 05:31.619
Because we're sharing a house.

05:31.620 --> 05:32.779
You what?

05:32.780 --> 05:34.939
A police house.
I've been on the list for ages,

05:34.940 --> 05:37.379
but they only give them to couples,
so Carrie offered her services.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.619
but they only give them to couples,
so Carrie offered her services.
You jammy bastard.

05:40.620 --> 05:43.179
I mean...

05:43.180 --> 05:45.419
I'm paying 400 quid a month
for a shithole.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.779
And you get a subsidised house,
it's hardly fair.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.899
power shower, fridge freezer.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.059
Could sub-let your place,
and move in with us.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.459
What?

05:53.460 --> 05:56.339
We've got a spare room.

05:56.340 --> 06:00.299
With three of us splitting the rent,
it'll cost next to nothing.

06:00.300 --> 06:04.299
I don't mind if I do.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.139
There's someone at the house.

06:10.140 --> 06:14.139
Must be a buyer.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.419
Jesus! Blondie's no oil painting,

06:20.420 --> 06:22.619
but you're really scraping
the barrel with this one, bruv.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.339
Who the fuck are you?

06:24.340 --> 06:27.099
The name's Kelly.
I'm looking for my brother, Kev.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.139
Can I speak to him?

06:29.140 --> 06:33.139
I think you'll find he doesn't
live here anymore, darling.

06:33.340 --> 06:34.339
Police! No-one move.

06:34.340 --> 06:35.739
Piss off, you dyke.

06:35.740 --> 06:38.699
We've reasonable grounds to
search your property, Mrs Maguire.

06:38.700 --> 06:42.699
You're not coming anywhere near
my house without a search warrant.

06:42.980 --> 06:45.979
It's only a matter of time, Mimi.

06:45.980 --> 06:49.179
Who the fuck's Mimi?
And where's our fuckin' Kevin?

06:49.180 --> 06:50.899
That is foul and
unacceptable language.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.299
Fuck off!

06:53.300 --> 06:56.179
(SCREAMS) I will not tolerate

06:56.180 --> 07:00.179
offensive language on my patch!

07:00.180 --> 07:03.939
What are you taking it out
on her for? She's not a Maguire.

07:03.940 --> 07:04.619
That was threatening behaviour.

07:04.620 --> 07:07.619
Yeah, from you.
Hit first, ask questions later.

07:07.620 --> 07:11.619
Again. You're leaving me no option.

07:15.260 --> 07:18.179
I love the way her nostrils flare
when she gets pumped.

07:18.180 --> 07:22.179
Have you noticed that?

07:29.900 --> 07:32.939
We're losing money hand over fist
because of you.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.099
It's not my fault pigs
are staking out t'house.

07:35.100 --> 07:38.499
It is your fault we can't
distribute through the van.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.939
Wrong change? How's my counting now?
6, 7...

07:41.940 --> 07:45.939
Oi! Leave my son alone!

07:46.780 --> 07:50.779
I'll have your head
on a fuckin' stick.

07:50.860 --> 07:53.059
What kind of a man
beats up a 12-year-old?

07:53.060 --> 07:54.899
He were disrespecting me.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.579
I'll disrespect you
right fuckin' now.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.099
He'll never learn that way.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.699
He'll take the van out and face
the consequences of his actions.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.899
But...they'll kill me.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.659
Then it'll be a lesson. No son of
mine hides behind the curtains

08:07.660 --> 08:11.659
when he should be out earning.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.739
Ow! What is the problem?

08:39.740 --> 08:43.739
The problem is, Kelly, love, last
time I gave you a bed, you turned

08:43.900 --> 08:44.939
the house into a knocking shop.

08:44.940 --> 08:48.939
I'll pay rent.

08:48.980 --> 08:52.979
I've got nowhere else to go.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.699
No, I'm sorry.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.099
I've got the kids to think about.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.499
You're not exactly
a fuckin' role model, are you?

09:01.500 --> 09:02.139
Who's paying?

09:02.140 --> 09:03.219
She is.He is.

09:03.220 --> 09:06.539
If you don't pay, you don't play.

09:06.540 --> 09:10.539
Fuckin' hell.

09:12.980 --> 09:16.979
No more for Frank Gallagher
unless he pays cash.

09:17.260 --> 09:19.019
Take your winnings and fuck off.

09:19.020 --> 09:21.059
But I've got a repeat chance.

09:21.060 --> 09:25.059
You also have a chance to keep
your kneecaps. What's it to be?

09:32.100 --> 09:34.379
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

09:36.220 --> 09:39.659
A pint, an Irish chaser,
and a large vodka and Coke.

09:39.660 --> 09:43.659
the world go round... #

09:44.580 --> 09:46.099
Oh, God.

09:46.100 --> 09:49.459
What's the point?
Everybody hates Brussels sprouts.

09:49.460 --> 09:52.779
If a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing right, Carl.

09:52.780 --> 09:54.499
Even for Monica.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.139
The family that eats together
stays together.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.779
Mind you, once you've seen
a man's eating habits,

09:58.780 --> 10:00.819
the romantic illusion shatters.

10:00.820 --> 10:03.299
My Brendan used to eat like
a cow chewing cud.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.099
Couldn't get it out of my head.

10:05.100 --> 10:09.099
Any time he wanted
to...emigrate south.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.699
Where did Brendan
want to emigrate to?

10:12.700 --> 10:14.299
Me fanny.

10:14.300 --> 10:18.179
TIMER DINGS

10:18.180 --> 10:20.059
Something's burning.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.299
Shit!

10:21.300 --> 10:23.019
6.80.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.899
Take care of it,
we're all family now, aren't we?

10:25.900 --> 10:28.499
That comes out of my wages.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.299
I'll pay for it.

10:30.300 --> 10:34.299
That's not the point.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.339
All right, Dad?

10:42.340 --> 10:46.339
Fine, yeah.
Fuck off.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.539
All right, Lip.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.419
Hiya, Frank.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.819
Do you want to earn some cash?

11:24.820 --> 11:28.819
..he's a muppet.

11:29.580 --> 11:32.739
Carl, they'll put you
in a young offenders'.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.419
I didn't steal it, I made it.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.059
What for?

11:35.060 --> 11:36.739
Special occasion.

11:36.740 --> 11:39.299
Like a proper family.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.339
What's that?

11:41.340 --> 11:43.699
Potato peelings.

11:43.700 --> 11:47.619
It's harder than it looks.

11:47.620 --> 11:51.619
What occasion?

11:51.980 --> 11:55.979
(WOMAN MOANS)

12:00.420 --> 12:02.259
Hello?

12:02.260 --> 12:06.259
(MOANING CONTINUES)

12:16.700 --> 12:17.739
Carl, calm down!

12:17.740 --> 12:18.739
Don't tell me what to fucking do!

12:27.700 --> 12:28.139
Is it ready yet?

12:28.140 --> 12:30.499
What have you done?!

12:30.500 --> 12:34.499
I am not answerable to you!

12:37.360 --> 12:38.959
It's a very skilled job.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.759
What, selling 99s and nougat wafers?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.919
And the code. You have to
know the code, Frank.

12:43.920 --> 12:44.799
Like what?

12:44.800 --> 12:48.559
Like, if someone asks
for a Smartie, they want a pill.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.559
If they ask for an M&M,
they want a pill.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.799
If they ask for a Disprin...

12:52.800 --> 12:55.519
They want a pill.
Yes, there's a pattern forming.

12:55.520 --> 12:59.519
You're a one-man fucking
Enigma machine, Shane.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.359
Make sure you follow 't route.

13:02.360 --> 13:06.359
I am well acquainted with
the ice-cream van concept,
for fuck's sake.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.559
Bye-bye, Frank.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.119
(FARTS)

13:27.120 --> 13:28.479
KNOCK AT THE DOOR

13:28.480 --> 13:31.839
Take a message.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.439
Listen, if this is about earlier on,

13:34.440 --> 13:36.759
I don't want to talk about it.
You need help.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.479
No, it's not.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.999
I wanted to ask a personal favour.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.199
Yeah, sure, anything.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.759
I'm out of clean laundry. I wondered
if I could borrow a pair of boxers.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.759
Yeah, top drawer, over there.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.519
I'll wash them for you.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.519
No, don't bother,
I'll wash them myself.

14:19.200 --> 14:23.079
You have to do it,
though, don't you?!

14:23.080 --> 14:26.519
Just dump your bags down there
till I get your room sorted.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.879
What's going on?

14:27.880 --> 14:31.439
Lodger. Tenner a night.
Just till she finds
somewhere more permanent

14:31.440 --> 14:35.239
This is you sorting it out, is it?
Bringing a drunken slapper
into the house?!

14:35.240 --> 14:37.719
Fuck off, you skank,
I've been clean two years.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.999
Oh, whatever! Nice one.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.799
Kelly, listen.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.719
Fuck!

14:42.720 --> 14:43.759
Out.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.279
How pussy whipped are you?

14:47.280 --> 14:51.279
Don't you think that's
a bit hypocritical considering
how your family earns its corn?

14:51.800 --> 14:53.639
I'm not having that in my house.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.519
What shall I do, conjure money
up for you out of thin air?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.479
It's not for me!
It's for us, it's for her!

14:59.480 --> 15:03.479
Whatever, Mandy, whatever!

15:04.240 --> 15:08.239
We need to sort this!

15:17.560 --> 15:19.599
I were hungry.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.279
She's thinks she owns the place.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.559
If it wasn't for her,
everything'd be fine.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.759
She's your mother, Carl.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.759
Not her, Norma. She's spoiling it
for everyone. I fucking hate her.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.319
I wish she'd just fuck off.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.079
Christ, Carl, stop
feeling sorry for yourself!

15:34.080 --> 15:37.679
You're all the same, whining
on and on and never doing nothing.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.519
We've all got problems, you know.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.439
BABY CRIES

15:41.440 --> 15:45.079
If Norma bothers you that much, grow
a spine and do something about it,

15:45.080 --> 15:49.079
instead of sitting here
crying to me.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.039
I weren't crying.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.879
1.80, love.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.199
And I'll have some
of them M&Ms, son.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.719
What, really?

16:00.720 --> 16:04.719
Not supposed to at my age,
but if you don't tell, I won't.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.879
Whatever floats your boat.

16:07.880 --> 16:11.039
How many do you want? Three? Four?

16:11.040 --> 16:13.719
Give us a 10 bob bag and
a bottle of ginger beer.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.479
Wait your turn, cheeky bastard.
Don't they teach you to say please?

16:17.480 --> 16:21.479
All right, please will you stop
being such a loser and give us a 10
bob bag and a bottle of g

16:22.600 --> 16:24.239
You'll get nothing, ASBO twat.

16:24.240 --> 16:28.239
Grab it.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.079
Are you sure them are M&Ms?

16:35.080 --> 16:39.079
What? Yeah, M&Ms, Tic Tacs,
Smarties, whatever.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.199
Well, go on, bugger off,
you coffin dodger.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.879
3.90.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.879
A little something from me to you.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.919
For our shared future together.
Keep the change.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.079
You'd hardly know there
was any of you in her.

17:15.079 --> 17:19.079
You'd hardly know there
was any of you in her.
What's yours is mine.
What's mine's me own.

17:27.960 --> 17:28.839
Need a word.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.599
Need a word.
Yeah, in a minute.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.599
Need a word.
Yeah, in a minute.
Now!

17:36.840 --> 17:39.399
Karen?

17:39.400 --> 17:40.919
Give us a minute, will you?

17:40.920 --> 17:42.079
I'll give you two if you're good.

17:42.080 --> 17:46.079
I'll give you two if you're good.
Fuck off.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.879
What's going on?

17:48.880 --> 17:50.879
What's going on?
That.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.519
She's just trying to
get a rise out of you.

17:52.520 --> 17:56.079
She's just trying to
get a rise out of you.
Yeah? Well, she's succeeded.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.599
This is a threat.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.879
Do you know what it says?

17:58.880 --> 18:02.879
It says she's claiming
the baby we've not had,
we've not even talked about!

18:02.960 --> 18:06.679
It says wherever we go, whatever we
do, the nasty bitch will be there.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.559
She won't let anything come
between her and her precious son.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.159
She won't let anything come
between her and her precious son.
Hey, that nasty bitch
is still my mother.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.599
What?

18:13.600 --> 18:17.599
What?! You can keep your fucking
ring up your fucking arse!

18:18.000 --> 18:21.999
It's gonna be a cold day in Moss
Side before I go near a Maguire!

18:28.040 --> 18:32.039
Karen.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.399
I just got my ring back.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.799
Happy?

18:45.800 --> 18:47.199
What have I done?

18:47.200 --> 18:50.799
I don't button up the back, Mum.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.799
If I have to choose between you
and her, there's no competition.

18:54.840 --> 18:55.479
That's out of line.

18:55.480 --> 18:59.479
That's out of line.
No, you're out of line!
I've fucking had it with you!

19:04.240 --> 19:08.239
That boy needs to learn
which side his bread's buttered.

19:08.760 --> 19:12.759
Who does that slag think she is,
knocking back my son?

19:15.040 --> 19:19.039
# I see trees of green

19:19.480 --> 19:21.959
# Red roses, too... #

19:21.960 --> 19:25.239
Here you are. Make your day
go with a swing.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.959
# For me and you

19:28.960 --> 19:32.759
# And I think to myself

19:32.760 --> 19:34.039
Here!

19:34.040 --> 19:38.039
# What a wonderful world

19:38.720 --> 19:40.519
Party!

19:40.520 --> 19:44.519
# Yes, I think to myself

19:47.640 --> 19:51.639
# What a wonderful world. #

20:05.280 --> 20:09.279
All right, Carl, love?

20:09.680 --> 20:11.959
I was hoping to have a word.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.039
You know, about what you saw before?

20:15.040 --> 20:16.999
It wasn't what you might think.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.999
I've got these women's problems,
and I'd just painted my nails,

20:21.520 --> 20:24.159
so I asked Norma to help me,

20:24.160 --> 20:27.639
but she's quite short-sighted,
so she had to get very close.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.399
She'd just painted
her nails as well,

20:30.400 --> 20:34.399
so she was helping me out,
with her teeth, and, you know...

20:35.440 --> 20:39.439
Do I look like
I were born yesterday?

20:41.960 --> 20:45.959
All right, kiddies,
plenty for everybody.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.519
Get out of the van!

20:48.520 --> 20:52.519
Get out of the fucking van!

20:53.360 --> 20:54.399
Get out of the fucking van!

20:54.400 --> 20:56.639
All right, all right!

20:56.640 --> 21:00.639
Keep your hair on,
Freddie fucking Flintoff.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.439
You could at least have
the decency to show some remorse.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.679
Hey, don't get me started
on remorse, mate.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.919
I am full of fucking remorse.

21:08.920 --> 21:09.719
Smart arse.

21:09.720 --> 21:10.759
Smart arse.
That wasn't him.

21:10.760 --> 21:14.759
It was that van,
but it were a different bloke.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.159
Problem solved.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.879
Case of mistaken identity, Holmes.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.959
Happens all the time.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.119
Happens all the time.
Shut the fuck up!

21:22.120 --> 21:23.159
Give us the keys.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.279
Ah, keys.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.279
Opens the door to a world
of possibilities.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.799
Pchoo!

21:45.720 --> 21:47.999
Fancy a brand new PSP, lads?

21:48.000 --> 21:48.439
Let's have a look.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.479
How much?

21:49.480 --> 21:50.839
Just give us 80 quid.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.919
All right, Frank? I thought
you'd be still in casualty.

21:53.920 --> 21:57.319
What? Oh, shit.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.919
Look, I can explain, Shane.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.919
Where's your injuries?
I thought they'd kick

22:02.960 --> 22:03.399
the living shit out of y

22:03.400 --> 22:05.319
They were gonna batter me,
how come they didn't batter you?

22:05.320 --> 22:08.239
how come they didn't batter you?
You what?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.879
Oh, I get it.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.239
Send out the human fucking punch bag?

22:12.240 --> 22:13.199
Where's the van?

22:13.200 --> 22:16.039
Where's the van?
It's gone.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.199
The wafers, the pop, the
gobstoppers, it's gone, all of it.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.879
How could you lose the van?!

22:22.880 --> 22:24.839
Me mam's gonna fucking kill me.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.799
They were very unreasonable people.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.399
I am gonna die
because of you, you dickhead!

22:30.400 --> 22:34.399
She might be a little upset,
but she's not gonna want to lose
two in the same year.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.679
I'm not gonna fucking die. You are.

22:36.680 --> 22:37.799
Is that the police station?

22:37.800 --> 22:41.439
Is that the police station?
If you don't get that fucking
van back, you fucking knobhead...!

22:41.440 --> 22:43.239
That's enough, Shane!

22:43.240 --> 22:47.239
Rrrrrrrgh!

22:50.040 --> 22:53.719
Well, you could at least buy
a traumatised man a fucking drink.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.399
I'm skint.
I was hoping to tap you.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.879
What?

22:57.880 --> 23:01.879
Have we met?

23:02.720 --> 23:03.879
No-one move.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.799
Fuck me, it's RoboCunt.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.839
You moderate your language.

23:07.840 --> 23:11.079
We've had a call about a disturbance.
Everyone just take it easy.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.999
Get on the ground, all of you.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.079
Oh, fuck off, I've had
enough for one day.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.119
Do not leave the scene.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.599
He was the one that got robbed!

23:18.600 --> 23:19.479
Stay where you are.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.639
What's he supposed to have done?

23:20.640 --> 23:22.519
Is that stolen property?

23:22.520 --> 23:25.479
No, it's mine!

23:25.480 --> 23:27.879
ZAPPING

23:27.880 --> 23:31.879
Fucking hell! What are you doing?!

23:32.720 --> 23:33.559
That's enough.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.599
That's enough.
That's it.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.399
You're out of chances.
I'm making this official.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.999
He was resisting arrest.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.599
Cos he didn't do anything.

23:39.600 --> 23:43.599
Carrie! >

23:43.720 --> 23:47.359
This is still stolen property.

23:47.360 --> 23:51.359
Everybody makes mistakes.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.239
What are you doing?

24:02.240 --> 24:06.239
Fall in a canal, come out
with a fucking salmon, you would.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.799
# Mission: Impossible Theme

24:44.320 --> 24:46.359
Oi! Turn the bloody light on! >

24:49.080 --> 24:53.079
Everything's gone off? >

25:01.440 --> 25:05.439
You little bastard.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.599
Sleep well?

25:34.600 --> 25:38.599
TYRES SCREECHING

25:39.820 --> 25:41.259
Get in the car.

25:41.260 --> 25:42.859
No, I'm fine thanks.

25:42.860 --> 25:46.859
No, I'm fine thanks.
Get in the car.

25:49.300 --> 25:53.299
Go.

25:53.780 --> 25:57.499
# And I can't take
my eyes off you. #

25:57.500 --> 25:58.659
KNOCK AT DOOR

25:58.660 --> 25:59.939
KNOCK AT DOOR
Occupied.

25:59.940 --> 26:03.939
Sorry, couldn't wait.

26:05.140 --> 26:08.779
It's OK.

26:08.780 --> 26:11.979
TINKLING

26:11.980 --> 26:15.979
You all right?

26:18.500 --> 26:19.819
It was a mistake.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.299
Stan'll come around.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.419
No, he won't.

26:22.420 --> 26:25.819
He's gonna make an official report.
You'll be cited as a witness.

26:25.820 --> 26:28.899
I need you to be on my side.

26:28.900 --> 26:32.899
I don't want to get caught
in the middle of something.

26:38.700 --> 26:42.699
Got any soap in there?

26:46.940 --> 26:50.939
We should be on each
other's side, Tom.

26:57.500 --> 27:01.499
I'll let you finish off.

27:09.460 --> 27:10.499
It were an accident.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.019
It were an accident.
Customs check the wagons
coming in the country.

27:13.020 --> 27:15.179
They don't check them going out.

27:15.180 --> 27:17.739
I can head off right now
and drop you in Baghdad.

27:17.740 --> 27:21.739
No-one would be any the wiser.
How long do you think you would last?

27:22.180 --> 27:26.179
MUEZZIN CALLING
AND AGONISED SCREAMING

27:26.380 --> 27:29.219
You'd better start talking
or I'll get so pissed off,

27:29.220 --> 27:32.019
I'll get my driving boots on.

27:32.020 --> 27:36.019
Egg mayonnaise?

27:39.860 --> 27:43.859
Respect other
people's property, Carl.

27:59.260 --> 28:03.259
Idiot.

28:06.020 --> 28:09.019
Still there?

28:09.020 --> 28:13.019
It's the gift that keeps giving,
baby. Do you want to have a go?

28:13.140 --> 28:15.419
Your cock may be the
only thing on your mind

28:15.420 --> 28:18.739
but hard as it is to believe,
it is not the only thing on mine.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.819
We're out of nappies.
She's got a rash.

28:20.820 --> 28:24.819
Is your hard-on going to fix that?

28:25.180 --> 28:26.899
It's a misunderstanding.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.699
We want you and Jamie
to be happy together.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.379
We want you and Jamie
to be happy together.
Call the wedding back on.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.179
It is what everybody wants.

28:32.180 --> 28:34.299
We're not like most families.

28:34.300 --> 28:38.299
Most families can't communicate.

28:41.660 --> 28:44.659
She is maybe a bit
over-enthusiastic at times,

28:44.660 --> 28:47.619
but it seems harsh to report her.

28:47.620 --> 28:50.939
You could illuminate Blackpool
pleasure beach with the amount

28:50.940 --> 28:53.659
of electricity she pumped
into that Gallagher lad.

28:53.660 --> 28:57.659
I can't sign it.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.459
I think she's got a crush on me.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.619
What?!

29:02.620 --> 29:05.579
We had a moment
in the bathroom earlier.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.579
There is something between us.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.899
So, how come she came into my room

29:10.900 --> 29:14.899
flashing her muff
looking to borrow my underwear?

29:17.980 --> 29:21.979
She's making wankers
of the pair of us.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.259
What's happened
between you and Carl?

29:24.260 --> 29:26.339
Shouldn't you be at
school or something?

29:26.340 --> 29:27.459
Shouldn't you be at
school or something?
What did he see?

29:27.460 --> 29:29.939
I don't want to
discuss this with you.

29:29.940 --> 29:33.059
It's all about you, isn't it?
What about him? He's your son.

29:33.060 --> 29:36.619
Oh, change the record!
I am not an indentured servant.

29:36.620 --> 29:39.579
No, you're not.
But you are a spoilt bitch.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.739
You want all the good stuff
and none of the bad.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.379
Well, there's a lot of bad,

29:43.380 --> 29:47.379
regardless of how my stupid
brother wishes there wasn't.

29:57.940 --> 29:59.019
Afternoon.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.979
What do you want?

30:00.980 --> 30:02.899
Could we have our van back, please?

30:02.900 --> 30:06.899
No.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.339
Hit him. Fucking smack him one.

30:09.340 --> 30:13.059
Which one of us is he talking to?

30:13.060 --> 30:15.179
I don't think it really matters.

30:15.180 --> 30:19.179
Dad, that's the bloke.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.939
You couldn't shut up for two fucking
minutes, could you? I nearly had it.

30:22.940 --> 30:26.939
You couldn't shut up for two fucking
minutes, could you? I nearly had it.
You were going to run, you liar.

30:28.020 --> 30:32.019
Come here!

30:33.500 --> 30:35.299
We're not so different, me and you.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.699
Yeah, people often mistake me
for a mental black dyke.

30:38.700 --> 30:41.979
All right. I mean
with regards to your mam.

30:41.980 --> 30:44.659
How?

30:44.660 --> 30:46.699
Well, we both want her to love us.

30:46.700 --> 30:48.899
Yeah, you was loving her
plenty last time I saw.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.539
Yeah, you was loving her
plenty last time I saw.
I am not talking about sex.

30:50.540 --> 30:53.699
I'm talking about love.

30:53.700 --> 30:56.019
The difference is you've got it.

30:56.020 --> 31:00.019
Why don't you fuck off then?
Stop living in the back yard.

31:00.980 --> 31:02.939
I've got no choice.

31:02.940 --> 31:06.739
Do you know how humiliating it is
for me living outside your back door

31:06.740 --> 31:09.299
in a camper van?

31:09.300 --> 31:13.299
That's love, mate.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.059
CHEERING

31:24.060 --> 31:26.339
CHEERING
Taking the piss.

31:26.340 --> 31:27.819
Happy days.

31:27.820 --> 31:30.139
If that's you with a hard-on,
you're gonna be a very lonely man.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.259
If that's you with a hard-on,
you're gonna be a very lonely man.
It's taped up.

31:32.260 --> 31:33.139
Mandy must be well happy.

31:33.140 --> 31:34.459
Mandy must be well happy.
You'd think so.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.779
The only thing
she can think about is money.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.019
How am I supposed
to get a job with that?

31:38.020 --> 31:42.019
How am I supposed
to get a job with that?
Dry your eyes. I kipped in a
fucking bus shelter last night.

31:42.180 --> 31:43.379
So how many times
have you shot your load?

31:43.380 --> 31:46.219
So how many times
have you shot your load?
None of your business,
you cheeky bastard.

31:46.220 --> 31:48.739
I've got an idea.
I saw an advert in the paper.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.099
Come here and I'll show you.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.899
Jez? You haven't seen
Karen, have you?

31:53.900 --> 31:57.899
Never showed up for her shift.
This is her final warning.

31:58.340 --> 32:02.339
Against my better judgment I might
have a solution to your problem.

32:03.740 --> 32:06.259
Service!

32:06.260 --> 32:08.179
Nothing was handed to us on a plate.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.459
We struggled for what we've got.
That's why we're so close.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.019
Family is important.

32:13.020 --> 32:14.979
25 years married.
Not many can say that these days.

32:14.980 --> 32:17.139
25 years married.
Not many can say that these days.
We don't sell gear outside schools.

32:17.140 --> 32:21.099
We have a quiet word
if anyone's getting too far
behind with their payments.

32:21.100 --> 32:24.539
I buy the Big Issue off that junkie
that dosses outside the arcade.

32:24.540 --> 32:27.979
We don't understand your objection.
We're good people.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.899
Really? That's how
you see yourselves?

32:29.900 --> 32:32.059
Really? That's how
you see yourselves?
Tell Jamie the wedding is back on.

32:32.060 --> 32:33.299
You're having a laugh?

32:33.300 --> 32:34.579
You're having a laugh?
Why all the hostility?

32:34.580 --> 32:38.579
Because you kidnapped me and tied me
to a chair, you fucking lunat...!

32:41.820 --> 32:44.579
Fancy a pint?

32:44.580 --> 32:48.579
Yeah.

32:49.620 --> 32:50.979
Why does it have to be mum?

32:50.980 --> 32:53.979
You don't choose who you fall
in love with. It just happens.

32:53.980 --> 32:57.979
For me, Monica is...

32:59.260 --> 33:00.379
She's the one.

33:00.380 --> 33:01.899
What's so special about her?

33:01.900 --> 33:05.899
Man, she is so fragile,
like a little...

33:07.340 --> 33:10.299
I just want to protect her,

33:10.300 --> 33:13.499
save her.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.059
The daft thing is she saved me.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.699
How?

33:16.700 --> 33:17.939
I met her after I got out of prison.

33:17.940 --> 33:20.419
I met her after I got out of prison.
Prison? Why, what did you do?

33:20.420 --> 33:21.819
None of your business.

33:21.820 --> 33:25.819
My self-destruct button
was well and truly pressed.

33:27.420 --> 33:29.779
Heading for an early grave, me.

33:29.780 --> 33:32.899
Monica, she gave me a reason
to be a better woman,

33:32.900 --> 33:35.379
so I could look after her.

33:35.380 --> 33:36.899
So...

33:36.900 --> 33:39.979
is that how you
become a dyke then?

33:39.980 --> 33:42.539
Sorry. I mean a lezza. In prison?

33:42.540 --> 33:46.539
What, you think women's prisons
are all like some B movies?

33:46.660 --> 33:50.659
You know, spend all our days soaping
up each other's tits in the shower.

33:52.660 --> 33:56.659
Well, that's pretty
much what it's like.

33:57.500 --> 34:01.219
No smoking in the house,
no eating in the bedroom,

34:01.220 --> 34:03.819
no use of television
during selected times.

34:03.820 --> 34:07.179
I like me programmes.

34:07.180 --> 34:10.819
Showers between 8 and 8:30am only.

34:10.820 --> 34:13.779
How the fuck did the
Nuremberg trials miss you?

34:13.780 --> 34:15.739
40 a week in advance.

34:15.739 --> 34:17.819
50 if you're claiming housing.

34:17.820 --> 34:21.819
All right.

34:23.219 --> 34:26.099
What's the idea, anyway?

34:26.100 --> 34:29.219
Ice cream in a fucking van.

34:29.219 --> 34:31.179
Everyone's had freezers
since the 19...

34:31.179 --> 34:32.219
Everyone's had freezers
since the 19...
Can I have a pint?

34:32.219 --> 34:34.978
You should be ashamed of yourself
taking advantage of an old widow.

34:34.980 --> 34:38.978
You should be ashamed of yourself
taking advantage of an old widow.
Where's my fucking van?

34:41.219 --> 34:43.938
They took it.

34:43.940 --> 34:45.978
They won't give it back to us.

34:45.980 --> 34:48.139
What do you mean, us?

34:48.139 --> 34:52.139
Frank offered to help.

34:52.219 --> 34:53.539
It was him that lost it.

34:53.540 --> 34:55.699
So much for fucking solidarity.

34:55.699 --> 34:59.699
We told you to fix it, not find some
other arsehole to do it for you.

34:59.740 --> 35:00.779
No offence, Frank.

35:00.780 --> 35:01.699
No offence, Frank.
None taken.

35:01.700 --> 35:05.099
No offence, Frank.
None taken.
We'll sort this out right now.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.259
I think I'll leave you to it.
This is family business.

35:07.260 --> 35:11.259
I think I'll leave you to it.
This is family business.
That's a very unlikely outcome,
don't you think, Frank?

35:11.500 --> 35:13.379
You haven't seen Karen, have you?

35:13.380 --> 35:14.499
You haven't seen Karen, have you?
No, son.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.939
She never showed up for work and
she is not answering her mobile.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.259
She never showed up for work and
she is not answering her mobile.
She'll come round.

35:18.260 --> 35:22.259
Come round to what?

35:25.100 --> 35:29.099
MOBILE RINGS

35:48.580 --> 35:52.579
You want retribution for what
my half-wit son did to your lad?

35:53.980 --> 35:55.259
What do you mean?

35:55.260 --> 35:59.259
How much retribution?
Is this enough?

36:01.220 --> 36:02.179
Is that broke?

36:02.180 --> 36:04.299
Is that broke?
Yeah, just above the wrist.

36:04.300 --> 36:08.299
I suppose a break deserves more...

36:12.460 --> 36:13.899
Is that enough?

36:13.900 --> 36:17.339
Give him a couple from me.
The little bastard set me up.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.219
Fuck!

36:19.220 --> 36:22.939
More?

36:22.940 --> 36:24.059
No, that's enough.

36:24.060 --> 36:25.179
Are you sure?

36:25.180 --> 36:27.059
Yeah.

36:27.060 --> 36:31.059
Good. Keys.

36:31.660 --> 36:35.659
Ta.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.739
Dad?

36:44.740 --> 36:47.339
Mum, are you in?

36:47.340 --> 36:51.339
Fucking hell!

36:51.820 --> 36:55.819
MOBILE RINGS

37:02.740 --> 37:05.219
MUFFLED CRYING

37:05.220 --> 37:07.259
Jesus Christ!

37:07.260 --> 37:11.259
What have they done to you?

37:17.100 --> 37:19.139
Here you are, get these down you.

37:19.140 --> 37:23.099
And let bygones and all that shite.

37:23.100 --> 37:26.139
You know, if it's all the same,
I think I'll leave you to it.

37:26.140 --> 37:30.139
You know, family bonding
and all that.

37:35.380 --> 37:39.379
CHUCKLING

37:43.020 --> 37:45.779
Let's get something straight.

37:45.780 --> 37:49.379
If she doesn't want to be with me,
then that's totally up to her.

37:49.380 --> 37:52.219
But it's her decision
and you'll respect that.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.299
We were only trying
to get to know her.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.579
You were bullying your way
to get what you want!

37:56.580 --> 37:58.459
You were bullying your way
to get what you want!
That's enough.

37:58.460 --> 38:02.099
I want you to know,
if it doesn't stop, I'm gone.

38:02.100 --> 38:06.099
You're choosing her over the family?

38:06.580 --> 38:10.579
They won't bother you again.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.339
Jamie?

38:14.340 --> 38:15.379
What's going on?

38:15.380 --> 38:16.899
What's going on?
Don't ask.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.339
LAUGHTER

38:20.340 --> 38:24.339
She's gonna kill me!

38:25.260 --> 38:28.419
And what's so important
you had to come down here?

38:28.420 --> 38:30.299
I haven't got time for this.

38:30.300 --> 38:34.299
I haven't got time for this.
Stop!

38:34.420 --> 38:35.459
This.

38:35.460 --> 38:38.099
This.
How did you...?

38:38.100 --> 38:39.339
Did you go with somebody?!

38:39.340 --> 38:40.139
Did you go with somebody?!
No!

38:40.140 --> 38:43.379
Did you go with somebody?!
No!
Lip!

38:43.380 --> 38:46.019
Sperm bank.

38:46.020 --> 38:48.979
It were his idea.

38:48.980 --> 38:52.299
We went to four.
50 quid a shot, three more tomorrow.

38:52.300 --> 38:56.299
50 quid?

38:57.500 --> 39:01.499
You owe me 250 after this morning.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.859
I'll work it off.

39:03.860 --> 39:07.859
LAUGHTER

39:10.940 --> 39:13.219
Go on.

39:13.220 --> 39:17.219
Thanks.

39:28.580 --> 39:32.579
Mum?

39:35.020 --> 39:38.019
Oh! Oh, Gus!

39:38.020 --> 39:40.099
What d'you want?!

39:40.100 --> 39:42.579
It's a birthday cake.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.579
Happy birthday!

39:44.580 --> 39:48.579
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!

39:54.180 --> 39:55.659
Oh, shit!

39:55.660 --> 39:57.699
It's all right, keep your hair on.

39:57.700 --> 40:01.699
It's just a spot check.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.019
Hey, get a grip on yourself.

40:05.020 --> 40:07.619
Stop letting your personal life
interfere with your work.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.659
Stop letting your personal life
interfere with your work.
I'm not.

40:08.660 --> 40:12.659
What's so funny?

40:12.820 --> 40:15.899
You're a Maguire, aren't you?

40:15.900 --> 40:18.179
You should be thankful
we're not making a formal complaint.

40:18.180 --> 40:19.859
You should be thankful
we're not making a formal complaint.
No need to over-react.

40:19.860 --> 40:23.539
He could be damaged for life.

40:23.540 --> 40:24.819
Still there?

40:24.820 --> 40:28.819
He's bluffing.

40:32.540 --> 40:36.539
For God's sake, woman.
Have you no shame?

40:37.820 --> 40:41.819
Feel free to let go
of my boyfriend's cock any time.

40:44.940 --> 40:48.939
And we'll have his PlayStation back.
Soon as you're ready.

40:49.460 --> 40:51.259
It's in the glove compartment.

40:51.260 --> 40:55.259
I'll get it.

40:59.620 --> 41:02.139
You can leave now.

41:02.140 --> 41:06.139
Till next time.

41:25.780 --> 41:29.299
Karen, don't. This is gonna
be hard enough as it is.

41:29.300 --> 41:32.659
What is?

41:32.660 --> 41:35.219
You and me not...

41:35.220 --> 41:36.499
getting married.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.139
Being together.

41:39.140 --> 41:41.899
After what you've just done,

41:41.900 --> 41:45.899
do you think I can just walk away?

41:56.820 --> 42:00.819
Looks like the wedding's back on.

42:03.340 --> 42:06.019
We did it, sweetheart.

42:06.020 --> 42:10.019
I'm fucking made up.

42:13.420 --> 42:15.259
She's got no shame.

42:15.260 --> 42:17.139
I had no idea, Lillian.

42:17.140 --> 42:19.539
If you want her out,
just say the word.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.339
Why would I want her out?

42:21.340 --> 42:25.339
Every time she has a gentleman caller
round I get an extra fiver.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.739
You keep getting the
wrong end of the stick, Tom.

42:35.740 --> 42:38.219
You had a pretty firm hold of it
from where I was standing.

42:38.220 --> 42:41.259
You had a pretty firm hold of it
from where I was standing.
Don't be like that.

42:41.260 --> 42:42.459
I need your help.

42:42.460 --> 42:46.459
I'm sorry, I'm far too busy.

42:49.660 --> 42:53.659
Please?

42:55.420 --> 42:58.459
This doesn't change anything,
I'll still have to report you,

42:58.460 --> 43:01.819
but it's good we can separate
the personal from the professional.

43:01.820 --> 43:03.499
I had an inkling,
when we first met.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.539
I thought I saw you
looking at me arse.

43:05.540 --> 43:09.539
I've got quite a good arse for...
Good grief!

43:10.100 --> 43:11.139
What's going on?!

43:11.140 --> 43:12.579
Are you two...?!

43:12.580 --> 43:14.619
No, no, no!
It was a moment of weakness.

43:14.620 --> 43:18.379
How can you report someone
you're sleeping with, unless...!

43:18.380 --> 43:19.899
Unless you're blackmailing her!

43:19.900 --> 43:20.939
Unless you're blackmailing her!
What?!

43:20.940 --> 43:23.219
Are you forcing her to sleep
with you so you won't report her?

43:23.220 --> 43:27.219
Are you forcing her to sleep
with you so you won't report her?
No, no, no! I never.
Carrie, tell him.

43:28.620 --> 43:31.179
Look...

43:31.180 --> 43:33.059
Forget about the report, OK?

43:33.060 --> 43:37.059
We'll just start with a clean slate.
I dunno what I was thinking.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.819
LAUGHTER

43:51.820 --> 43:54.979
You've outdone yourself, Carl.
This is dead tasty.

43:54.980 --> 43:57.539
It weren't really me.
It was Lillian and Carol.

43:57.540 --> 43:58.979
Cheers, Carol.

43:58.980 --> 44:00.819
Cheers!

44:00.820 --> 44:02.259
Happy days.

44:02.260 --> 44:03.259
Happy days.

44:03.260 --> 44:04.299
Happy days.
Here we go.

44:04.300 --> 44:06.579
An occasion like this
demands a toast.

44:06.580 --> 44:08.139
In difficult times like these...

44:08.140 --> 44:09.859
In difficult times like these...
What difficult times?

44:09.860 --> 44:12.579
Well, you know...

44:12.580 --> 44:12.979
CRYING

44:12.980 --> 44:14.699
CRYING
No, I've started so I'll finish.

44:14.700 --> 44:18.259
Our boys are abroad
fighting for democracy.

44:18.260 --> 44:21.419
But you said they were all
oil thieving bastards.

44:21.420 --> 44:25.099
Yes, they are! But they're
thieving the oil for us.

44:25.100 --> 44:27.059
What are they gonna use it for?

44:27.060 --> 44:28.459
Fucking floodlit camel racing?!

44:28.460 --> 44:29.219
Fucking floodlit camel racing?!
It's imperialism all over again.

44:29.220 --> 44:30.859
Fucking floodlit camel racing?!
It's imperialism all over again.
Well what's wrong with that?

44:30.860 --> 44:34.859
The British Empire civilised
half of the entire world.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.219
It was a very beneficial
arrangement.

44:37.220 --> 44:38.539
Yeah, for us, maybe.

44:38.540 --> 44:41.299
No, no! You know, for everybody!

44:41.300 --> 44:43.059
The brotherhood of man.

44:43.060 --> 44:44.859
# ...Kisses for me. #

44:44.860 --> 44:46.899
Oh, those were the days.

44:46.900 --> 44:49.019
No, that were Mary Hopkins.

44:49.020 --> 44:53.019
# Those were the days, my friend
I thought they'd never end... #

44:53.220 --> 44:54.619
Time warp, man.

44:54.620 --> 44:57.819
I'm not saying the bloke
that wrote the poem was wrong.

44:57.820 --> 45:00.859
Shelley and Lord Byron were
supposed to be pretty smart,

45:00.860 --> 45:03.939
so maybe it is possible
for your parents to fuck you up.

45:03.940 --> 45:07.939
But in a good way.

45:14.230 --> 45:15.629
Maybe we're not normal.

45:15.630 --> 45:19.629
So what?

45:29.550 --> 45:31.389
Normal is the opposite to special.

45:31.390 --> 45:35.389
There's no doubting the Gallaghers
are a special family.
