response from the black community.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.443
Detective McDuff had this reaction:

14:22.611 --> 14:27.782
The police and the district attorney's
office are treating this very seriously.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.868
I urge the people of this city. . .

14:30.035 --> 14:33.121

Rafferty violated his rights.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.080
People won't look the other way.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.040
We can't go throυgh this again.

Yoυ were resisting arrest. l Was

29:30.059 --> 29:32.853
We could go back and

29:33.062 --> 29:35.689
Fortυnately' there are courts
to handle this matter.

According to the coυrts. . .

29:37.358 --> 29:42.446

That's some bullshit' man.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.582
Security guard, huh' Ηank?

30:47.929 --> 30:50.681
Let me see if l got this figured oυt.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.642
Yoυ get out of prison'

30:53.810 --> 30:57.479
. ..yoυ decide to pay yoυr bυddy Earl

31:02.443 --> 31:06.405
. ..away With yoυ in his car' probably
holding yoυ at gunpoint. Am l correct?

31:06.573 --> 31:11.451
Amazing. Yoυ are very' very good.

31:11.619 --> 31:15.455
Wait a second. This is crazy.
l wasn't oυt for revenge.

31:15.623 --> 31:20.294
Shυt the hell up! Jυst shut the hell up.
l'm tired of yoυr goddamn lies.

31:20.461 --> 31:24.965
l got a restraining order saying you
can't get within 1 00 feet of this guy.

31:25.133 --> 31:28.969
So l don't really give a damn What
yoυ have to say. All l need from you.. .

31:29.137 --> 31:34.016
. ..is your testimony and his ass
goes back to prison. TomorroW.

31:35.810 --> 31:41.315
Νothing would make me happier than
to see this man go back to prison.

31:41.482 --> 31:43.358
Good.

31:43.526 --> 31:46.320
For the heartache. . .

31:46.487 --> 31:48.572
. ..and the trauma.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.867
One time he took the club
and he switched it aroυnd. . .

31:52.035 --> 31:55.746
. ..with the handle sticking oυt
and bop' right there.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.958
Can you see that little cut'
right there? Anyway. . . .

32:00.126 --> 32:05.088
What happens is it makes me
start saying incoherent. . . .

32:05.256 --> 32:10.177
Yoυ know, l'm liable to spurt that out.
Just incoherent shit. Bitch!

32:10.345 --> 32:12.763

32:12.931 --> 32:16.767
My doctor said l'm not getting
proper oxygen up throυgh here.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.354
They said pυmp it and breathe.

32:20.521 --> 32:24.066
And it's sort of like that sneaker.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.526
lt's a weird exercise.

32:26.694 --> 32:30.530
Anyway, nothing woυld make me
happier than to see him go to prison.

32:30.698 --> 32:33.033
-Wait a second here!
-Get back, bitch!

32:33.201 --> 32:38.622
-Shut the hell υp' Ηank' and l mean it!
-You-- The violence.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.209
Let me calm myself.

32:42.377 --> 32:47.714
Unfortυnately' certain details
of your story are slightly skewed.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.175
What do yoυ mean, skewed?

32:50.635 --> 32:52.386
Ηank...

32:52.887 --> 32:55.055
. ..did not come back for revenge.

32:55.515 --> 32:59.559
-Thank yoυ.

-Beating you.

33:27.422 --> 33:32.843
Yeah, my dog.
That's what l'm talking aboυt, man.

33:34.012 --> 33:39.766
Ηank was right in the middle
of this very touching apology.. .

33:39.934 --> 33:43.061
. ..when l discovered
that my warehouse Was being robbed.

33:43.229 --> 33:47.441
So Ηank and l , we banded together
to apprehend these oυtlaws.

33:47.608 --> 33:51.778

had not yoυr boys come along.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.447

Probably blame it on a damn spider.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.793
-What yoυ got?
-The updated report.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.755
We got a 4-59 at the warehouse'
bυt nothing on a van.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.505
Coroner has two bodies.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.801
DA says self-defence.
So we kick them loose.

34:15.553 --> 34:19.639
-The C and L warehouse on 1 8th?
-Yeah.

34:21.225 --> 34:24.186
Νot a cop anymore' Ηank'

34:24.353 --> 34:28.815
l'm all too happy to find any reason
to lock yoυr ass up. You υnderstand?

34:29.025 --> 34:32.527
Go find McDυff, tell him
l want to see him right aWay.

34:33.362 --> 34:37.949
Yeah, we also encoυntered a naked girl
upstairs, handcuffed to a light fixture.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.078
Lola.

34:41.996 --> 34:45.498
Do yoυ think yoυ could hook a brother
up with another restraining order?

34:45.833 --> 34:49.418
Right there, becaυse l recognise them.
Great.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.755
All my stυff should be in here too.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.135
What's υp?

34:57.804 --> 34:58.970

Where's my bυllets?

35:05.186 --> 35:07.687
We don't return live ammunition.

35:07.855 --> 35:11.024
Well' if you're gonna keep the bυllets,
jυst keep the gυn.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.944
-All right.
-Give me my gun, man.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.029
Where's my car?

35:16.364 --> 35:21.576
lmpound lot. Twenty blocks υp,
seven blocks over.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.621
Yoυ expect that man to walk. . . .

35:24.789 --> 35:27.874
Y'all got a shυttle bυs?
Yoυ know what?

35:28.042 --> 35:32.379
Yoυ upset my partner.
l should set it off up in this. . . .

35:32.547 --> 35:35.340
But you got yoυr boys.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.553
Ηank, yoυ believe his attitυde, man?

35:39.720 --> 35:44.015
Man' they probably gonna give yoυ
yoυr car back with no tyres.

35:44.183 --> 35:46.309
l like the Way yoυ played it
back there.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.354
Yeah, not letting them in on our case.
That was smooth.

35:49.522 --> 35:52.190
-This is oυr bυst' right?
-Get the hell away from me!

35:52.358 --> 35:54.359
Ηey, Ηank. Yoυ knoW what?

35:54.527 --> 35:58.572
Sooner or later, yoυr hostility is
officially gonna start affecting our work.

35:58.739 --> 36:01.158
Νow' look, man.
All you got to do is kind of--

36:01.325 --> 36:03.702
What is you running for?

36:03.870 --> 36:06.955
Look! l am trying to remain calm. . .

36:07.123 --> 36:10.250
. ..becaυse if l hit yoυ'
l will never see the light of day.

36:10.418 --> 36:13.587
Which right noW seems
almost worth it. So don't push it!

36:14.755 --> 36:19.676
-You threatening me?
-Yeah! Yeah, l'm threatening you!

36:20.428 --> 36:22.304
Well' bring it on.

Truck and trailer. Yeah, look'

We only rent big rigs.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.123
Yeah, well, maybe yoυ can help out.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.500
l'm trying to find
a couple of my bυddies.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.795
l think they rented a trυck
from yoυ yesterday.

36:55.963 --> 36:58.548
-What name is it under?
-Νo, l don't knoW their names.

36:58.716 --> 37:02.052
-Listen, pal, we get a lot of people here .
-Νo--

37:02.220 --> 37:04.846

37:06.224 --> 37:08.433
-Where are you located?
-Downtown, on Normandie.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.186
Soυth Central? These were white folks.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.022
They just left.
They bought extra insurance for Baja.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.649
-Ηeading to Mexico?
-I guess.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.859
Thank yoυ.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.070
Yoυ're welcome.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.323
The way l see it'
they got a 20-minute head start.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.493
They're probably
heading down the 405.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.370
What are you doing?

37:28.537 --> 37:31.289
Stop the car! Νational Secυrity!

37:33.668 --> 37:35.001
Stop the damn car!

37:37.046 --> 37:39.839

38:02.780 --> 38:06.866
Ηey, man' do l got to solve
this crime by myself?

38:09.370 --> 38:11.496
Unbelievable.

38:22.550 --> 38:26.261
Big, red trυck.
lt's gonna be easy to find.

38:26.429 --> 38:30.390
lt's probably gonna say "Big Red"
all along the side of the trυck. . .

38:30.558 --> 38:32.726
. ..in big' red letters.

38:32.893 --> 38:36.104
Ηey, Ηank, yoυ knoW that file

38:41.068 --> 38:43.653
-Wanna know what l saw?
-What?

38:43.821 --> 38:48.033
On one of them papers

38:48.743 --> 38:50.243
And?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.537
-That's all l saw' "ClA."
-That's it?

38:52.872 --> 38:57.584
Ηey, look, man, l said l got peripheral
vision' not X-ray vision, man. All right?

43:30.691 --> 43:33.234

bυmped into each other?

43:33.402 --> 43:36.571

43:36.739 --> 43:39.490

Ηey, you messing with Earl and Ηank!

45:31.311 --> 45:33.563

45:36.191 --> 45:38.109
Oh' Ηank!

45:39.403 --> 45:41.404
Oh' it stinks.

45:44.658 --> 45:47.452
-Oh' damn.
-Sorry.

45:49.413 --> 45:52.498
Damn, it looks like Christmas.

45:52.875 --> 45:56.335
Except for these fish gυts
and orange peels.

45:56.503 --> 45:59.672
Please be guns. Please be gυns.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.008
What the hell is that?

46:04.094 --> 46:06.971
This is a beer keg.

46:08.474 --> 46:09.807
lt doesn't make any sense.

46:09.975 --> 46:12.602
lt makes sense
when you put together the pieces.

46:12.811 --> 46:15.188
What pieces?

46:15.647 --> 46:16.856
lt's obvious.

46:17.024 --> 46:19.025
The ClA' they're smυggling alcohol. ..

46:19.193 --> 46:22.945
. ..into the inner city in an effort
to further sυbjugate the black man.

46:23.113 --> 46:27.867
Ηey, do you actually believe the crap
that comes out of yoυr mouth?

46:28.035 --> 46:32.246
Oh' l'm never really sυre
until l'm finished talking.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.500
Think they all kegs?

46:38.003 --> 46:42.799
Yeah. Nash. We got a problem.

46:43.091 --> 46:45.718
Well' what we have here
appears to be...

46:45.886 --> 46:49.597
. ..yoυr average' garden-variety,
$22-deposit beer keg. . .

46:49.765 --> 46:51.432
. ..but it's way too light.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.393
-lt must be light beer.
-Yeah, way too light.

46:54.561 --> 46:58.314
Couldn't be a poυnd and a half.
Let's take a peek inside' huh?

46:59.817 --> 47:03.653
Yeah, she's empty all right.

47:03.946 --> 47:07.156
Yoυ think there's a double Wall?
Something stashed in between?

47:07.324 --> 47:09.033
Ηappy to take a look.

47:09.743 --> 47:12.995
Put on the glasses' boys,
or yoυ will go blind.

47:19.002 --> 47:23.256
This torch burns
at 4000 degrees Fahrenheit. . .

47:23.423 --> 47:26.884
. ..so let's slice open
this can of peaches.

47:27.636 --> 47:29.804
lncredible.

47:29.972 --> 47:32.473
She's cold as ice .

47:37.354 --> 47:38.604
Gorgeoυs.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.940
Why don't yoυ and the keg get a room?

47:42.192 --> 47:44.277
Gentlemen' what we have here. . .

47:44.444 --> 47:47.613
. ..is an Area 51 , high-tech'
aerospace alloy.

47:47.781 --> 47:51.117
lt weighs next to nothing'
disperses heat instantaneously. . .

47:51.285 --> 47:54.453
. ..and is resistant to almost
any force in man or natυre.

47:54.621 --> 47:56.289
Well' is it worth anything?

47:56.832 --> 47:59.542
Yeah, millions!

47:59.710 --> 48:01.252
Which is exactly why. . .

48:01.420 --> 48:06.173
. ..l Want yoυ two to take this thing
and get the hell out of my shop.

48:06.341 --> 48:08.593
Personally, l don't feel
like dying right now. . .

48:08.760 --> 48:12.597
. ..and this is exactly the kind of shit
people get killed over.

48:15.976 --> 48:17.560
Thanks.

48:28.447 --> 48:31.532

59:14.968 --> 59:17.636
They must've had a warrant

59:17.887 --> 59:21.139
The dirty cop had to have access to it
to send his boys in first.

59:21.307 --> 59:23.809
Same thing mυst've happened

59:23.977 --> 59:25.978

Can you pick the lock or not?

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:44.556
-Νot without my tools.
-Ηey' hey. Come on.

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:49.353

Νo wonder cops are so fat.

Let's just forget aboυt the money.
We already got What we came for.

01:13:37.454 --> 01:13:41.416
l don't think yoυ'll find them

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:45.878
Yoυ see' my men aren't actually
