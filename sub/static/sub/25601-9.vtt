38:25.203 --> 38:28.374
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.211
Kev, he was...

38:34.580 --> 38:36.815
He was gonna kill
somebody bad, Mama.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.517
Somebody who knew people

38:38.550 --> 38:40.652
who might have come looking
for payback.

38:40.686 --> 38:43.555
Come after me, you...

38:43.589 --> 38:45.791
everybody.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.827
I didn't mean
to kill Kev, Mama.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.731
I didn't mean to kill Kev.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.401
(crying softly)

38:58.837 --> 39:02.007
(sighs)

39:02.040 --> 39:03.509
Uh...

39:03.542 --> 39:07.045
look, I-I-I don't know
what might happen,

39:07.078 --> 39:09.648
and I might have to leave,

39:09.681 --> 39:12.217
but I had to see you.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.219
I had to see you,
and I had to tell you

39:14.252 --> 39:17.923
that I don't want to lose
nobody else I love.

39:17.956 --> 39:21.927
I thought I could do all
of this and help my people.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.596
But it's not working out.

39:24.630 --> 39:29.034
-(crying softly)
-So I want you to know...

39:29.067 --> 39:31.269
that if having you
in my life

39:31.302 --> 39:34.606
means that I got
to stop all of this...

39:34.640 --> 39:37.008
then I'm gonna do that
for you, Mama.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.044
(crying)

39:45.717 --> 39:48.386
Say something, Mama,
please.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.625
I just want to make sure
you're protected.

39:53.659 --> 39:54.960
(knock at door)
ANDRE: Cissy, it's Andre.

39:54.993 --> 39:55.961
Open up.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.429
-You go.
-Fuck.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.897
ANDRE: I know Franklin's
in there.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.666
BOTH: I love you.
(knocking continues)

40:03.001 --> 40:04.302
(gun cocks)

40:04.335 --> 40:05.637
-Police!
-Let me see your hands!

40:05.671 --> 40:07.773
Don't shoot him!
Please, don't shoot him.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.241
-Don't move!
-Don't shoot him.

40:10.275 --> 40:11.610
Wait, wait, please.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.812
Don't shoot him.
Don't shoot him.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.581
-Stop resisting!
-All right!

40:15.614 --> 40:17.449
-(groaning)
-Franklin.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.984
-Come on.
-Stay down.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.752

40:22.688 --> 40:24.155
