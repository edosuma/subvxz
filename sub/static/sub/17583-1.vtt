00:09.777 --> 00:13.013
**

00:17.151 --> 00:20.020
[chattering]

00:24.358 --> 00:25.726
[man]
Didn't see you here
last Friday.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.395
[woman]
No, but I loved the place.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.231
-Friday...
-I know.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.267
Here you go, ladies.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.504
All right, so we got you
your director-approved apron.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.772
Yeah, yeah.
I like the small better.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.410
So, I saw his abs.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.378
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.747
Yeah. He just
ripped his shirt off
right in front of me.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.183
Abs for days.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.718
[woman]
What did you do?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.286
Well, I did
what any girl would do.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.155
I just refrained
from asking him

00:54.155 --> 00:58.159
to take a selfie with me
for my Instapics.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.561
And you? Are you
gonna be able to handle
looking him in the eyes

01:00.561 --> 01:03.331
without stumbling
over your lines?

01:03.331 --> 01:05.199
I think I'll manage.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.835
I mean, he's just a person
like everyone else, right?

01:07.835 --> 01:09.137
[women]
Right.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.573
We're ready for her.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.142
Let's go, Clare.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.409
It's Clarissa.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.146
Go, go, go.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.248
Let's go.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.551
I need everyone
at their ones!

01:23.551 --> 01:26.120
Okay, guys, quiet on set!

01:26.120 --> 01:28.189
We're gonna roll
for rehearsal.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.423
Sound!

01:31.759 --> 01:35.829
All right. Scene 101 A,
take one: Coffee Shop Crush.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.566
And action.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.137
Hi.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.672
I didn't see you
last Friday.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.408
Or the Friday before,
but you were here...

01:47.408 --> 01:49.743
[both]
three Fridays ago.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.545
I was visiting my mom
in San Fran.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.647
Aw, that's sweet.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.516
[man]
I thought
I'd never see you again.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.684
[woman]
Well, I'm here now.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.154
Let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.194
Can I get you anything else?

02:06.194 --> 02:09.697
Think I've got everything I need
right here in front of me.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.764
[all exclaiming]

02:10.764 --> 02:12.333
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.436
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry!

02:15.436 --> 02:16.637
[exclaims]

02:16.637 --> 02:19.673
Um... No.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.342
I didn't know
the lid wasn't--

02:21.342 --> 02:23.844
Don't sweat it.
Wardrobe has doubles.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.851
Wardrobe has doubles.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.753
Yeah. You, come with me.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.862
Clarissa, honey, you always
gotta check your props.

02:41.862 --> 02:45.499
I know. I made
a complete fool of myself

02:45.499 --> 02:49.403
in front of two of the hottest
up-and-coming actors
in Hollywood right now.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.805
Oh! Oh, please!

02:51.805 --> 02:55.209
Honey, Stella is
a notorious diva.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.912
It was probably her bad karma
that caused it to happen
in the first place.

02:58.912 --> 03:03.584
And Chas,
he's all sexy soap-appeal,
no brains above.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.753
I doubt he'd remember you
if he saw you.

03:05.753 --> 03:09.523
Jeannette, I know
how hard you worked
to get me that audition.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.325
Forget it. Okay?

03:11.325 --> 03:13.561
You still got paid,
and we'll keep it
on your headshot

03:13.561 --> 03:15.229
until we book you
something better.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.499
Yeah. But what if this small
part led to something bigger?

03:18.499 --> 03:21.335
Clarissa, it was seven lines.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.772
It's not the end of the world
or your career.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.507
You're barely 24.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.875
Yeah. Well, Stella's 24.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.312
So says her publicist.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.915
I'll have you know
that Stella is nearly 30.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.585
And do not compare
yourself to her.

03:37.585 --> 03:40.254
You are a talented actress.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.890
So you're not all
lips and lashes.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.459
But you are beautiful.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.728
You look like
a storybook princess.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.963
And you're vulnerable,
yet you're strong.

03:49.963 --> 03:55.002
Honey, you have star quality,
that's why I signed you.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.770
You're right.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.839
I mean, 'cause if
I don't believe in myself,
who will, right?

03:58.839 --> 04:01.609
See? You are
a great actress.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.576
What?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.612
Well, even though
you're down on your luck

04:04.612 --> 04:06.514
and you don't believe
a word you just said,

04:06.514 --> 04:07.915
you had me convinced.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.918
Thanks.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.754
All right. You go home,
you get some rest.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.856
And I'm gonna get you out
for a commercial audition

04:15.856 --> 04:17.925
on Friday at two
in Studio City, okay?

04:17.925 --> 04:22.396
I can't. I'm going back home
for a bridal shower, remember?

04:22.396 --> 04:25.433
Yes, you're maid of honor
in your best friend's
wedding, right?

04:25.433 --> 04:27.601
The honor is all mine.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.036
All right.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.306
Well, it'll be good for you
to get away. Go have fun!

04:32.306 --> 04:34.542
And, Clarissa...

04:34.542 --> 04:37.845
Life is a movie
if you let it be. I know.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.714
-Okay.
-All right. Go have fun.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.049
-Bye.
-Bye.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.788
Of course I'm coming!

04:47.788 --> 04:50.424
You think I'd miss
your bridal shower?
I'm your maid of honor.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.660
Um... About that.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.061
What?

04:54.061 --> 04:56.397
Well, since you
don't live here,

04:56.397 --> 04:58.632
and you've been so busy
with your auditions and stuff,

04:58.632 --> 05:00.668
and haven't really
been able to help
with planning,

05:00.668 --> 05:02.770
I kind of had
to make you like...

05:03.971 --> 05:05.373
a co-maid of honor.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.608
I'm sorry,
you made me a what?

05:07.608 --> 05:10.110
A... co-maid of honor.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.947
Maya, there's no such thing
as co-maid of honor.
Are you serious?

05:13.947 --> 05:17.351
Hey, look, it's my wedding,
and I can create whatever
kind of title I want.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.820
Look, Riss, I'm sorry.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.556
It's just Kelly's been
the one who's been doing
all the grunt work on this.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.359
So, I had to kind of
give her that title.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.428
And you know
I wish it were you.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.697
But I realize how busy
you've been with your auditions.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.732
Not anymore.
I just got fired.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.402
And now I just got fired from
wedding duties, too. Great.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.736
Look, it's not
like that, okay?

05:35.736 --> 05:39.072
I still want you
right by my side on that
big wedding day, okay?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.975
Nothing's gonna change
besides a silly little title.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.011
You're my best friend, Riss.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.980
I mean, heck,
you're like family to me.
Sister I've never had.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.584
You're right.
I'm sorry. It's...

05:50.584 --> 05:52.920
I guess it's a good thing that
Kelly stepped up to the plate.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.156
Yeah. Well, don't get me wrong,

05:56.156 --> 05:57.991
her and Veronica
have been driving me nuts,

05:57.991 --> 06:01.795
but I will say that those two
know how to get stuff done.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.464
[Clarissa]
Okay, fine.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.734
But when I get there tomorrow,
I'm gonna have my say in
some of the arrangements, too.

06:06.734 --> 06:07.935
Of course you will.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.404
And me and Pete will be there
to welcome you with open arms.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.105
How is the old fart, anyway?

06:12.105 --> 06:13.607
Speaker phone!

06:13.607 --> 06:15.843
Pete! You know I love you.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.077
How am I an old fart?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.579
You're old.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.748
I'm six years older.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.883
You should've seen him
running at the park today.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.885
He fell over
after the first mile.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.587
That is her cooking.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.591
She's trying to keep me heavy
so I'm slow and easy to catch.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.494
So, Riss, how the heck
did you get fired
from your job?

06:33.494 --> 06:39.633
I... spilled coffee
all over Chas Hunter
and Stella Sommers' laps.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.770
But, Riss, you really
are a waitress.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.939
I know. I must've been,
like, nervous. I don't know.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.076
Well, was it hot at least?
I hope it was boiling hot.

06:49.076 --> 06:52.713
That Stella Sommers
deserves it.
She's so full of herself.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.548
Yeah. But what did I do
to deserve it?

06:54.548 --> 06:56.216
I mean, I thought
my karma was pretty on point.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.651
I don't know.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.153
You're just gonna
have to leave it up
to a higher calling, I guess.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.655
Okay? 'Cause everything
happens for a reason.

07:01.655 --> 07:05.659
And if this wasn't
your ticket to success,
then the next thing will be.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.160
I just wish
I could do it over.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.062
Well, when that
opportunity comes,

07:09.062 --> 07:11.599
you just have to make sure
that you're ready to take it.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.901
Aw, thanks. You're the bestest
friend ever, you know that?

07:13.901 --> 07:16.136
No, you are.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.006
Okay, I'm gonna be
there this weekend.
I will see you guys.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.476
I cannot wait to just relax
and not think about Hollywood.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.544
Bye!

07:38.225 --> 07:40.060
Can I get you guys
anything else?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.663
No. I think we're
all right, thank you.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.764
Perfect.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.168
Uh... Chas.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.804
Hey.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.273
Hi.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.175
You know, I...

07:56.677 --> 07:58.579
I think I came
to the wrong place.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.621
Hey, Melody, can you
watch my tables for a second?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.590
Hey, baby, can we just
meet back at my place?

08:09.590 --> 08:12.192
The menu here
isn't so great.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.728
Yeah. I'll pick us up
some takeout.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.196
All right, bye.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.931
You didn't even
look at the menu.

08:20.267 --> 08:23.036
I didn't think my publicist
would like it here is all.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.706
You thought I was gonna pour
cold coffee on your lap again.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.141
I'm not an idiot, you know.
I wait tables for a living.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.110
Really?

08:30.110 --> 08:34.548
Shouldn't you be brunching
at the Ivy with some
Teen Choice Award winners?

08:34.548 --> 08:36.817
I don't even know you're name.
Why are you so mad at me?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.885
You're the one
who set our shoot
back two hours.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.923
You know what? Does no one
blame the props master
for not doing his job?

08:42.923 --> 08:45.325
Checking your props
is practically
Acting Class 101.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.827
Since when?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.096
Since always. I don't know.
That doesn't change.

08:49.096 --> 08:53.266
Great, I'm getting
acting advice from
kids' TV show star.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.636
Wait, you watched
Cool Time Kids?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.638
Everyone our age did.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.973
You had a crush on me,
didn't you?

08:59.973 --> 09:02.009
Come on, admit it.
You thought I was cool.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.812
[sighs] I have
to get back to work.

09:04.812 --> 09:08.048
Just remember, coffee is
better in a cup
than on your shirt.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.950
Joke! It was a joke!

09:09.950 --> 09:14.121
Come on. You'll get
a better gig. Just...
you know, avoid props.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.288
[door slams]

09:16.724 --> 09:19.693
Hey, I didn't know...
Excuse me.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.028
That was Chas Hunter!

09:21.028 --> 09:22.129
The one and only.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.131
Okay, he's hella dreamy.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.899
And he knows it.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.236
Wait. So, are you two,
like, really a thing?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.904
No. Why would you think that?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.740
Because this pic I saw online.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.841
What pic?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.844
The one of you and Chas

09:36.844 --> 09:40.280
clearly leaving some,
I don't know, VIP lounge
in Hollywood.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.615
That wasn't me.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.718
Okay.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.120
It wasn't!
Why would you think
it was me?

09:47.120 --> 09:49.389
I don't know. I mean,
you can't see her face,

09:49.389 --> 09:51.191
but she has
the same hair as you.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.961
It's not me.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.728
[woman]
It's so great.
Looks so good.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.095
[woman 2]
It does, actually.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.197
[people talking indistinctly]

11:04.197 --> 11:06.166
-Do you know what I mean?
-I know.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.702
[Clarissa]
You guys started without me?

11:08.702 --> 11:10.103
[shrieking]

11:11.304 --> 11:12.973
[Kelly]
Oh, my gosh!

11:14.174 --> 11:15.575
Oh, my gosh!

11:15.575 --> 11:19.412
If it isn't Clarissa Byers,
our fancy old friend
from Hollywood.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.783
This color is so in right now.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.917
Let's Instapic the moment.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.824
And I heard
you're doing a movie
with Chas Hunter?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.760
-Well--
-Okay, you have to
tell us all about it!

11:32.760 --> 11:37.164
Like, is he as hot
as he is in person?
Or is he, like, tall?

11:37.164 --> 11:40.067
Or is he kind of,
like, short?
What is he like, you know?

11:40.067 --> 11:42.269
The maid of honor
has finally arrived.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.336
[Kelly clearing throat]

11:44.371 --> 11:46.740
I mean, my co-maid of honor.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.443
Clarissa, you know
I'm only teasing.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.346
When you're here,
I want you to do
everything you can.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.149
And when you're not,
I just want to help out.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.018
Thanks, Kelly.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.320
I mean, that's really
sweet of you to help,
when I'm stuck in LA.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.122
-Champagne.
-Champagne.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.926
Hey.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.495
And I didn't tell anybody
you got fired.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.363
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.300
-[indistinct]
-Me, too.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.102
And how is Los Angeles, dear?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.971
It's good, you know.
Just going on
a lot of auditions.

12:17.971 --> 12:23.310
Okay, so, is Chas Hunter,
like, really tall
or just kind of tall?

12:23.310 --> 12:26.146
Um... No. Today is
all about Maya.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.849
Right! Guys, shower me
with attention.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.184
Right, right.
Totally right.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.021
We will revisit
this convo, believe.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.156
Okay, I want to open my gifts.

12:36.156 --> 12:40.493
And I hope you guys didn't
get me anything naughty,
because my mother is here.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.930
She's just worried
I may steal it.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.008
Grandpa!

12:55.008 --> 12:57.811
Clarissa? Is that you?

12:57.811 --> 13:00.113
Losing your eyesight already?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.982
So sad.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.385
No, no. I just didn't recognize
you with all that...
Hollywood Botox.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.987
No Botox.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.489
-Then why
do you look like that?
-Come here, jerk.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.558
Old man jerk.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.894
Good to see you, Pete.
Congrats.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.595
Thank you.
And thank you
for being here.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.197
I know it means
the world to Maya.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.133
Are all the hens
outside still?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.335
Yup, just picking up
some wine.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.104
Let's get this party started.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.240
Excuse me. Since when
does the groom join
the bridal shower?

13:27.240 --> 13:30.510
Since the groom's
poker party ended
two hours ago.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.146
Aw, lost all your
Monopoly money already?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.547
I don't get that game.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.386
Mr. Pete.

13:40.553 --> 13:41.855
Graham?

13:41.855 --> 13:44.224
Wow. I didn't even
recognize you!

13:44.224 --> 13:46.159
Howdy, Clarissa?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.294
Missed you.

13:47.294 --> 13:50.230
You look great!
I mean, how much--

13:50.230 --> 13:52.265
-You look--
-You can ask. It's okay.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.334
How much weight did you lose?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.835
Fifty-eight pounds.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.940
Yeah, give or take a few,
you know, depending on
what shoes I'm wearing,

13:59.940 --> 14:01.041
or how much I ate that day.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.442
That's crazy.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.311
I mean, I just
saw you last year,
after grad school.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.279
When did this happen?

14:06.279 --> 14:09.482
So, after that
I took spring break off,

14:09.482 --> 14:13.954
hired a personal trainer,
and focused on the body.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.422
And now?

14:15.422 --> 14:18.291
Now, I'm a project manager
at a tech firm near the beach.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.661
That is amazing.
Congrats. But I thought
you'd move back here.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.464
I'm close.
I visit on and off.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.634
Came back today
for Pete's poker tournament.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.369
Yeah, he is awful at poker.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.472
I destroyed him.
He's just so bad.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.242
What about you? How's LA?

14:35.242 --> 14:36.643
Dreams don't disappear!

14:36.643 --> 14:38.178
No, they don't.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.182
But...

14:42.182 --> 14:43.516
people do.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.152
Ouch! Is that directed at me?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.553
No, no. Of course not.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.156
Okay, maybe a little bit.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.591
Hey, you ran off to Atlanta
for college, remember?

14:51.591 --> 14:54.427
Yeah, but that's a close drive
compared to the Hollywood sign.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.130
And where would an actress go
to get a career?

14:57.130 --> 15:00.100
I'm not judging.
I'm just saying.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.069
You've been
missed around here.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.271
A lot has changed
since you've been gone.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.405
Hey.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.175
I can see that.

15:08.175 --> 15:11.578
Now I know what was
taking so long for you
to get that wine.

15:11.578 --> 15:15.015
Look at you two.
Together again at last.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.416
So cute.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.252
So... how long
have you guys been...

15:20.553 --> 15:22.089
-Two months.
-Two weeks.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.092
Two weeks?

15:25.092 --> 15:27.327
And what were we doing
before that?

15:27.327 --> 15:29.662
Two months.
I meant two months.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.599
Two weeks was, like,
officially became the...

15:34.968 --> 15:36.103
Yep.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.206
Two months.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.046
Are you ready to go home?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.614
Why don't we stay?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.417
I haven't seen
Clarissa in a while.
It'll be good to catch up.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.455
Well, of course we want
to catch up with Clarissa.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.260
Come on, let's go back
outside then, shall we?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.361
Okay.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.697
A lot's changed.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.267
Great.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.171
[Veronica] Clarissa,
you have to tell us.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.773
Have you been dating
any celebrities?

16:13.773 --> 16:19.046
Well, a lot of recurring
TV guest stars turn into
non-recurring dates,

16:19.046 --> 16:20.580
so, no, no one famous.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.316
What did you call them?
"On-set romances"?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.618
Showmances.

16:25.618 --> 16:29.722
Wasn't there
that director, Zeke?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.458
Yeah. That was a lifetime ago.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.261
Yeah. And he dumped her
on her birthday.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.329
We hate that guy.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.366
I mean, in his defense,
he didn't know
it was my birthday.

16:39.366 --> 16:43.370
And I'm focusing on my career
right now anyway, so...

16:43.370 --> 16:47.207
-It's fine.
-That's a good thing.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.576
But by choice,
because of course

16:49.576 --> 16:52.079
all the guys just
adore her out there.

16:52.079 --> 16:55.315
And I totally respect
that you just focus
on your career.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.150
And that takes
a lot of dedication.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.585
And it sounds
like it's paying off.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.088
You know, with this
big movie role and all.

17:01.088 --> 17:04.590
You booked a film?
That's awesome! Congrats.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.059
Yeah. Well--

17:06.059 --> 17:08.095
[Graham]
When does it come out?

17:08.095 --> 17:10.329
You know, I don't know.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.664
You know, my scene
could get cut, so...

17:11.664 --> 17:13.633
Why would your scene get cut?

17:13.633 --> 17:16.636
I mean, don't they
need you in the film?

17:16.636 --> 17:19.205
Aren't you, like,
a lead character?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.807
Well, I wouldn't
say that exactly--

17:20.807 --> 17:23.242
Okay, guys.
You guys, it's complicated.

17:23.242 --> 17:27.547
I mean, you know she has
to sign, like, a non-disclosure
deal and all that stuff, so...

17:27.547 --> 17:29.349
She's not even allowed
to talk about it. Right?

17:29.349 --> 17:30.617
It's top secret.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.320
Like, they shred
the script pages every day,

17:33.320 --> 17:36.623
so, like, no one knows,
who's gonna die.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.425
-[Maya]
No one dies, babe.
-[cell phone chimes]

17:38.425 --> 17:40.727
-It's a romantic comedy.
-Right. Yeah.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.395
Wait.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.463
Is that...

17:45.332 --> 17:46.499
-No way.
-What?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.435
-That's you!
-Huh?

17:49.669 --> 17:50.937
Like, the guy...

17:50.937 --> 17:54.141
She's the mystery girl,
the one that's kissing
Chas Hunter!

17:54.141 --> 17:55.242
No, no, no.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.310
You said
you worked with Chas.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.745
Yeah. Yeah, I did. But--

17:58.745 --> 18:01.148
That's why you've been
acting so shady?

18:01.148 --> 18:02.415
I'm not. It's just--

18:02.415 --> 18:03.750
A showmance!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.552
-No.
-Is it more then?

18:05.552 --> 18:07.720
Yeah. How much more?

18:07.720 --> 18:10.723
I wouldn't... say that.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.326
Then, do you even know him?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.362
No, I do.
He was just at my work
last week.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.364
Then it's true!

18:17.364 --> 18:20.233
Then you're dating
Chas Hunter.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.169
[clearing throat]

18:24.337 --> 18:25.538
[stammers]

18:25.538 --> 18:28.308
Yeah. It's true.
It's all true.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.243
He's a cutie pie.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.479
Okay, we just want to know
if he's coming to the wedding,

18:32.479 --> 18:36.883
because I want him to sign
my bridesmaid's dress.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.551
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.320
Okay, I don't see
what the big deal is.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.589
It's not like
I'm going to wear it again.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.191
He's not gonna come
to the wedding.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.125
No? Why not?

18:47.560 --> 18:50.430
Because... no one knows yet.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.566
It's a publicity thing,
you know, all that stuff.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.803
So, you guys
can't say anything.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.171
About what?

18:59.606 --> 19:00.907
Mrs. Byers!

19:00.907 --> 19:03.476
You didn't tell us
your little girl
was dating Chas Hunter!

19:03.476 --> 19:05.612
Well, I didn't know.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.347
Hi, Mom, Dad.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.715
Who's Chas Hunter?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.317
He's a cutie.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.285
That's what I said!

19:12.285 --> 19:14.521
What are you guys doing here?

19:14.521 --> 19:15.788
Well, we were
just driving by,

19:15.788 --> 19:17.757
we didn't know if you had
a ride home or not.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.659
I mean, you're staying
with us, right?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.294
Yeah. Right.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.830
My stuff is in the car.
I can meet you guys at home.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.732
Well, we can hang,
can't we?

19:25.732 --> 19:29.269
No. You know what?
I'm exhausted. Can we go?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.238
-Sure, honey.
-Okay.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.071
Bye, guys.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.941
-Hi, Graham.
-How's everybody doin'?

19:34.941 --> 19:36.676
Maya, hi!

19:40.513 --> 19:42.382
So, is it true?

19:45.252 --> 19:46.619
About Chas?

19:47.754 --> 19:49.822
Of course it is.
Why would I lie?

19:49.822 --> 19:52.559
Maybe because you don't want
any of them to know

19:52.559 --> 19:55.695
that you got fired
from your job?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.798
Look, Clarissa, it's okay
to be struggling. Okay?

19:58.798 --> 20:01.934
I promise you
all of them will understand.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.537
It's just like I said.
I can't say anything.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.308
Okay, fine.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.843
I just don't why
you wouldn't have
told me then.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.780
I mean, I wouldn't
have said anything.

20:13.780 --> 20:17.817
Yeah. Well, you could have
told me about Graham
and Kelly, too, you know.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.852
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.654
They'd started dating
right when he came back.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.357
And I didn't even think
it would last.

20:24.357 --> 20:28.027
It's fine.
It's just weird, you know.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.897
Kelly used to make
so much fun of him
back in school.

20:30.897 --> 20:35.402
Yeah. But, I mean,
he's a lot different
than he was back in school.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.870
Yeah. I guess.
He looks great.

20:37.870 --> 20:41.541
Yeah, but so does
Mr. Chas Hunter.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.612
I'm so sorry
all of that came up.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.614
Tonight really should have
been about you, not me.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.716
It's okay.
I'm just glad that you came.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.052
Just no more secrets, okay?

20:53.052 --> 20:56.389
Right. No more secrets.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.790
Okay.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.793
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

21:04.797 --> 21:08.368
Um... You're not telling
anyone, are you?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.436
No, no.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.839
Not really.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.775
-'Cause it kind of looks
like you're telling people.
-Yeah.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.944
No. She said
don't tell anyone.

21:17.944 --> 21:21.047
We don't know
anyone from Hollywood,
so it's fine.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.782
[cell phones chiming]

21:24.317 --> 21:25.852
[men sighing]

21:31.324 --> 21:33.460
-Morning!
-Hey, honey.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.961
-Hey, Dad.
-How'd you sleep?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.831
-I wish I didn't
have to leave so soon.
-Me, too.

21:38.831 --> 21:43.436
No. I can imagine
with all the fanfare
you're getting back in LA.

21:43.436 --> 21:46.706
Honey, why didn't
you tell us about Chas?

21:46.706 --> 21:48.475
There's nothing to tell.
It's not serious.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.510
But, I mean,
what do you mean by fanfare?

21:51.511 --> 21:53.613
Here. It's all over
the Internet.

21:53.613 --> 21:54.947
-What?
-Yeah.

21:56.115 --> 21:59.419
No, no, no!

21:59.419 --> 22:02.922
I mean, I know you guys
like to keep things
so mysterious, so romantic.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.059
Is he nice?
He looks nice here.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.030
What's wrong, honey?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.400
Coffee?

22:16.469 --> 22:17.637
[sighs]

22:23.476 --> 22:24.744
Hey!

22:24.744 --> 22:26.813
Who is she?

22:26.813 --> 22:28.681
She--

22:28.681 --> 22:31.751
I don't know.
It's some girl I met on set.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.920
So you are seeing her?

22:33.920 --> 22:36.523
I barely know her.
She's on the film
I'm working on.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.057
She had a small line.

22:38.057 --> 22:41.027
-And she got fired.
-Good!

22:41.027 --> 22:43.663
So if you're not seeing her
then what is all this about?

22:44.931 --> 22:46.733
I don't know!

22:46.733 --> 22:49.436
I woke up this morning
to your screaming voice mail.
You tell me.

22:49.436 --> 22:52.071
I am leaving for Paris tomorrow
for that press junket!

22:52.071 --> 22:54.607
I can't handle this right now.
I have too much on my plate.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.577
Baby, it's okay.
Calm down. It's fine.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.112
Calm down.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.917
I don't like her, okay.
I don't even know her.

23:04.917 --> 23:08.087
I ran into her at that diner
the other day.

23:08.087 --> 23:11.858
Somebody must've
saw us together and
just assumed we were dating.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.760
What were you
talking to her about?

23:13.760 --> 23:16.062
She was mad,
she thinks I got her fired.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.797
She spilled coffee on my lap.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.131
What was she doing
on your lap?

23:19.131 --> 23:22.168
She spilled coffee on my lap.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.505
[sighs]

23:25.505 --> 23:28.841
I don't get what you're
so mad about anyway?
You're married!

23:28.841 --> 23:32.044
That's over!
I'm just playing the game
so I can win in court.

23:32.044 --> 23:35.582
And that makes it better?

23:35.582 --> 23:38.918
There's nothing going on between
me and my husband, Chas.

23:38.918 --> 23:42.421
And there's nothing going on
between me and this...

23:44.156 --> 23:45.725
I don't even know
this girl's name.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.027
This Clarissa Byers chick.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.463
Well, now everyone thinks
you're together.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.865
Is that better
than people thinking
we're together?

23:57.136 --> 23:59.806
This might actually
be a good thing.

23:59.806 --> 24:03.209
If everyone thinks
you're with her,
then they won't suspect us.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.879
But I don't know her.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.147
It doesn't matter.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.249
You just have to convince
the media you do.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.118
You're an actor.
You'll be great!

24:15.822 --> 24:17.957
What exactly do you
need me to do?

24:17.957 --> 24:20.860
-Dump her, in public.
-What?

24:20.860 --> 24:23.730
I'll send a few paparazzi
to this diner where she works.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.998
You go there and dump her
in front of everyone.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.767
Claim she broke your heart.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.803
She's an opportunist
who sold your secret love
to the media.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.204
If she argues,
all the better.

24:32.204 --> 24:35.007
The media
will get it all on tape.
It'll be great!

24:35.007 --> 24:37.610
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.979
I'm your publicist.
Trust me, it'll work.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.114
And it'll put us in the clear

24:42.114 --> 24:45.151
until my divorce lawyer
gets everything hashed out.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.654
This is exactly
the cover we needed!

24:50.189 --> 24:52.258
She's never gonna go for it.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.194
She doesn't need to.
You're dumping her, remember?

24:55.194 --> 24:57.964
And if anything,
it's good press for her, too.

24:57.964 --> 25:01.634
She'll have
her five seconds of fame.
Believe me, she'll love it.

25:01.634 --> 25:04.837
I don't know.
She doesn't really seem
like the type, babe.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.081
[sighing]

25:32.732 --> 25:34.867
Oh, my God,
she's right behind us!

25:36.603 --> 25:38.605
[squeals]

25:41.674 --> 25:43.810
Chas' hot new flame
is back in LA.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.879
I'm sure she's ready
to rush back into his arms.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.351
Man, these paparazzi
sure love you.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.888
Yeah. Try getting
into an audition at 8 a.m.
with three cars chasing you.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.957
[whines sarcastically]

25:57.957 --> 25:59.759
Well, you said that
you two weren't dating.

25:59.759 --> 26:02.795
We're not. It's just
a big misunderstanding.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.964
Chas Hunter wants nothing
to do with me.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.601
Then why is he here?

26:12.338 --> 26:14.073
Oh, no.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.008
I knew it. You big fibber!

26:17.209 --> 26:19.178
Sorry! I am sorry
about everything.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.947
I swear I didn't tell anyone
we had a thing.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.783
It was just
a huge misunderstanding.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.619
But you did tell people
it was you in the photo.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.320
No.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.922
Well, yes. But no.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.660
See, they said it was me
and I just didn't tell them no.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.863
I went back home
for a bridal shower
last weekend.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.264
Bridal shower.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.967
-You a bridesmaid?
-Mmm-hmm.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.601
Yeah. Those are rough.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.640
Look, I just didn't want to
tell them I got fired, okay?

26:47.640 --> 26:51.277
So you told people
we were together instead?

26:51.277 --> 26:54.814
You don't know these girls!
They create fantasies
in their heads.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.849
Looks like
they're not the only ones.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.886
If you want me
to go out there and tell
everyone it was a lie, fine.

26:59.886 --> 27:02.288
End scene.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.291
Actually, I kind of need
your help with something.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.196
My help? With what?

27:11.664 --> 27:15.902
Well, I was kind of hoping
we might break up.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.704
In public.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.038
Break up? Why?

27:19.038 --> 27:21.340
No one can know
who was really with me
in the photo that night,

27:21.340 --> 27:24.376
so I kind of need people
to keep thinking it was you.

27:24.376 --> 27:25.444
Who is it?

27:25.444 --> 27:27.780
It's complicated.
But if...

27:27.780 --> 27:29.215
If people found out
I was dating this woman,

27:29.215 --> 27:31.718
it could destroy
both of our careers.

27:31.718 --> 27:34.320
Well, you didn't
really seem to care about
helping me save mine.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.355
You didn't ask.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.224
But I am.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.693
I'm asking
for your help here.

27:40.693 --> 27:43.896
Besides, this looks
like it might be pretty
good press for you.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.332
This really isn't
the type of press
I'm looking for.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.468
I mean, if I get famous,
I want it to because I actually
played the perfect part,

27:49.468 --> 27:53.272
not because I was the chick
dumped by Chas Hunter
in public.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.074
What do you want then?

27:55.074 --> 27:56.175
Money?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.077
No. I'm not
gonna lie for money.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.479
No, it's not lying.
It's acting.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.282
Besides, you didn't have
a problem lying to your
friends back home.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.720
All right,
so, what do you want?

28:10.122 --> 28:12.124
We have to break up
amicably, okay?

28:12.124 --> 28:13.826
Neither one of us
can be humiliated.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.262
I completely agree.
But we need to do this fast.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.998
Like, this weekend fast.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.733
I'm not around this weekend.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.434
This can't really wait.
I mean, in my experience,

28:22.434 --> 28:25.204
these things,
they get out of hand
pretty quick.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.239
Actually, this is perfect.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.475
You want to do it this weekend?
Then come with me to a wedding.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.212
No. No, no. No way.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.713
It's the least you can do.

28:36.348 --> 28:41.087
Okay. So, here is the flight
you need to book,
and my cell.

28:41.087 --> 28:44.156
You have to promise
you're not gonna
embarrass me, okay?

28:44.156 --> 28:46.859
I'm pretty sure you'll be able
to do that all on your own.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.731
I got it. I got it.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.774
You really need to stop
dropping things.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.242
Whoa. That got crazy fast.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.213
Okay, this weekend.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.349
We're getting married!

29:10.349 --> 29:12.351
This is the happiest day
of my life.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.886
Nice.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.355
[Melody]
Oh, my God!
Chas Hunter!

29:29.068 --> 29:31.971
[Clarissa]
I can't believe people think
we're engaged. This is insane.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.106
[Chas]
It's all part of
the break-up plan.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.542
It's your typical
Hollywood love story.

29:36.542 --> 29:40.246
Got engaged, and
that's what ultimately leads
to the untimely break-up.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.514
The fear of commitment,
wedding woes.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.183
Cheating with another woman.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.218
Hmm?

29:46.218 --> 29:48.287
Can you put that thing down
for, like, two seconds?

29:48.287 --> 29:51.057
We have to make sure our stories
are on the same page
if we're getting married.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.259
[sighs]

29:53.259 --> 29:55.027
All right. I got it.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.930
We met onset,
you spilled coffee on me.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.132
You offered to pay
for my dry cleaning.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.502
And when I called to collect,
you asked me out,
the rest is history.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.204
-I asked you out?
-Yeah.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.139
I don't think so.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.508
Why not?
Girls ask me out
all the time.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.879
Yeah. Starstruck girls.
That's not me.

30:12.879 --> 30:17.049
Okay. What's your
grandiose idea?

30:17.049 --> 30:18.885
I don't know.
We don't know a thing
about each other.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.621
Let me guess.

30:22.621 --> 30:26.592
You grew up,
bored in this small town,
always yearning for more.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.261
You watched chick flicks
at the discount cineplex

30:29.261 --> 30:32.164
and dreamed of being
the next Julia Roberts.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.968
So you saved all your
pennies from your job
at the local five-and-dime,

30:35.968 --> 30:40.206
hopped a bus
to pursue your dreams
in the City of Angels.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.640
Am I right?

30:41.640 --> 30:43.642
You got me.

30:43.642 --> 30:47.046
Except you forgot the part
when I went to college
and studied Communications,

30:47.046 --> 30:49.415
because I didn't think
I'd become an actor.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.351
And the year I moved back
with my mom

30:52.351 --> 30:54.486
because she was
battling breast cancer.

30:54.486 --> 30:59.025
And the time that I almost
threw in the towel in LA

30:59.025 --> 31:04.496
because my car died in K-Town
and I didn't have
the money to fix it.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.867
I'm sorry.
That's a tough ride.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.638
But, hey,
you stuck it out, right?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.641
Yeah. Don't be sorry.
I'm fine.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.677
I mean,
everyone has tough rides.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.079
Your turn.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.547
Come on. You got to guess.

31:21.547 --> 31:27.419
Okay. So, rich parents,
had you in acting
since you were a toddler.

31:27.419 --> 31:33.125
And when Cool Times ended,
you wanted to break out
of that perfect-kid persona.

31:33.125 --> 31:38.397
So you did that movie
where you were playing
the psycho pre-teen

31:38.397 --> 31:41.968
who was wreaking havoc
on your neighbors.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.204
Shunned by
your entire fanbase,

31:45.204 --> 31:51.010
you've spent the last decade
trying to regain
that perfect-boy image.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.012
But it's hard
because it's not you.

31:54.346 --> 31:57.283
Ouch. You play rough.

31:57.283 --> 32:00.219
So, what did I miss?
Other than the girls,
of course.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.156
Well, you got me.

32:04.156 --> 32:07.193
Bad guy. Right here.
That's me.

32:07.193 --> 32:10.129
I didn't say you were a bad guy.
I just said you weren't perfect.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.563
But nobody is.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.232
Tough rides for everyone.

32:16.068 --> 32:19.105
-You an only child?
-Yup. You?

32:19.105 --> 32:24.043
Three siblings,
parents divorced,
thank God for that.

32:24.043 --> 32:27.679
They still live in DC.
I'm not really too close
to any of them.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.681
Black sheep.

32:29.681 --> 32:32.618
More like the "who wants
to borrow money next" kid.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.220
Even your parents?

32:34.220 --> 32:35.654
You got it.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.157
Wow.
So, no rich parents, huh?

32:38.157 --> 32:40.692
Nah, I moved in with my aunt
when I was little.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.194
I was getting in trouble a lot.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.729
I was fighting
with my siblings.

32:45.564 --> 32:48.567
She's the one who helped me
channel that into my acting.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.269
She's still my best bud.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.205
Cute.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.567
So, who's getting married again?

33:21.567 --> 33:23.469
My best friend, Maya.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.137
She's the least
of our worries.

33:25.137 --> 33:28.340
The ones we have
to think about are
Veronica and Kelly.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.708
Why? What are they gonna do?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.777
They don't have to do
anything, just be.

33:31.777 --> 33:34.646
And I almost forgot.
All my close friends
call me Riss,

33:34.646 --> 33:36.248
it's just a lazy nickname.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.718
I almost forgot.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.053
Here.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.354
What's this?

33:42.354 --> 33:43.622
Put it on.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.627
Wow. That's amazing.

33:48.627 --> 33:51.797
Yeah. It's from
my aunt's first marriage.
She let me borrow it.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.533
Let me help you out.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.502
Thanks.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.736
[Chas]
There you go.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.109
-Let's do this.
-Yeah.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.650
This broach looks really good...

34:11.650 --> 34:13.252
I don't believe it.

34:15.187 --> 34:18.224
[mouthing words]

34:19.491 --> 34:21.092
They seem nice.

34:22.628 --> 34:24.563
He's real.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.665
Like...

34:26.665 --> 34:28.134
a real person.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.070
Hey!

34:36.275 --> 34:38.643
Chas Hunter, look at you!

34:38.643 --> 34:41.813
Just as handsome
as you are in the movies!

34:41.813 --> 34:43.514
And tall.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.284
-So, this is Chas.
-Can I tou--

34:45.284 --> 34:49.388
And this is Maya, Pete,
Kelly, Graham
and Veronica.

34:49.388 --> 34:50.556
Veronica.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.324
Hello, Maya, Pete.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.661
Kelly, Graham, and--

34:57.763 --> 34:59.498
Veronica.

34:59.498 --> 35:02.401
We all went
to school together.
Except for Pete.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.870
My fiance
graduated in the '90s.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.506
Yes. We didn't have
books then.

35:07.506 --> 35:10.809
There was no fire.
A lot of us didn't make it.

35:12.711 --> 35:15.347
My! Look at this!

35:15.347 --> 35:17.849
Oh... Wow.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.221
Congratulations
to the both of you.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.156
Yeah. Congrats.

35:24.156 --> 35:26.425
And congratulations
to you guys as well.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.726
Thanks.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.428
Got you a little something.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.730
-Wow. Thank you.
-Thank you. That was sweet.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.132
Did I just say,
"That was sweet"?

35:36.302 --> 35:39.538
Did we miss
the entire rehearsal?
I'm so sorry we're late.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.173
Yeah, you did.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.742
No, it's seriously fine.
You know how these things go.

35:43.742 --> 35:47.413
Walk down the aisle, smile,
grab a bouquet, done.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.181
And what held
you guys up, anyway?

35:49.181 --> 35:50.816
Believe it or not,
they had to delay the flight

35:50.816 --> 35:52.751
because everyone
asked for autographs.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.489
Where do we get in line?

35:57.489 --> 35:59.525
At least they held
the flight for us, right?

35:59.525 --> 36:02.394
I guess it helps
to be famous, huh?

36:04.630 --> 36:08.434
So, who wants some punch?
We're here, so, come on,
help yourselves.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.876
-So, what'd you get them?
-It's nothing.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.712
I like your friends.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.515
So do I.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.529
So, how do you like
our little town?

36:37.529 --> 36:38.597
It's...

36:39.731 --> 36:41.833
-Cozy.
-Cozy.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.835
And how did you
meet Clarissa, again?

36:43.835 --> 36:46.572
The last time she was here
she was very hush-hush and...

36:48.340 --> 36:50.876
We were on set together.
She... It's stupid.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.846
She got in trouble for
something that was actually
our prop master's fault.

36:54.846 --> 36:57.549
So, felt bad,
I went to visit her
at her work,

36:57.549 --> 36:59.351
asked her out,
and here we are.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.519
How sweet!

37:00.519 --> 37:02.454
Just darling.

37:02.454 --> 37:05.657
Swept in like a knight
and shining superstar.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.025
Okay.

37:07.025 --> 37:10.329
So... how are things
with Hollywood?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.831
They're good. Great.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.567
No. I mean, Mr. Hollywood.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.871
Yeah. They're fine. Good.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.474
I'm sorry, I shouldn't pry.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.510
No, it's fine. It's just...

37:24.510 --> 37:27.713
It's new, you know,
so we're still
getting to know each other.

37:27.713 --> 37:30.516
It's kind of a whirlwind
romance, you know?

37:30.516 --> 37:32.851
I used to do acting
back in high school.

37:32.851 --> 37:36.655
I was actually
Alice in Wonderland.
It was my senior year--

37:36.655 --> 37:37.923
Yeah? What did...

37:37.923 --> 37:39.691
What did Clarissa play?

37:40.726 --> 37:43.295
She was the Queen of Hearts.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.732
Really? It's...
my favorite character.

37:49.468 --> 37:52.771
Just wanted to make sure
you're making
the best decision, that's all.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.608
I could say
the same thing to you.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.850
So, are we ever gonna
talk about what happened
at graduation?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.654
Graham, I didn't know
what to say.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.322
I told you, "I love you."

38:11.323 --> 38:12.924
You could have said it back.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.094
Yeah, I just...

38:16.094 --> 38:18.897
Of course I loved you. But...

38:18.897 --> 38:21.933
You didn't think I was
good enough for you?

38:21.933 --> 38:24.035
We were friends.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.740
And... that meant
so much to me.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.008
Sweet.

38:31.910 --> 38:35.447
So, that's Graham, right?
What's Graham's story?

38:36.915 --> 38:39.751
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.053
He and Clarissa
were totally in love
back in school.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.323
He was chubby back then.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.026
Looks like he got it
sorted out now.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.695
Is there a gym around here?
I wanna--

38:49.695 --> 38:53.499
Do you remember...
freshman year,

38:53.499 --> 38:58.003
when I told my mom
that I was staying at Kelly's
parents' beach house?

39:00.372 --> 39:03.141
And I told my mom that
I had to go to Charleston

39:03.141 --> 39:05.611
to compete with the debate team,

39:05.611 --> 39:07.646
just so we can go camping.

39:09.915 --> 39:14.820
We heard that sound
and you thought it was a bear
and you freaked out.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.154
I did not!

39:16.154 --> 39:18.690
You got freaked out.
You could barely
roast your marshmallow.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.027
Well, if truth be told...

39:23.161 --> 39:25.831
I wasn't scared. I just...

39:27.733 --> 39:29.501
wanted to get closer to you.

39:40.446 --> 39:45.050
I don't... think
I have with Kelly
what I had with you.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.119
Maybe you haven't tried.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.156
Maybe you should.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.624
Maybe.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.762
Do you have with Chas what...

39:58.163 --> 40:00.031
you had with me?

40:00.031 --> 40:03.602
Or maybe better?

40:03.602 --> 40:05.103
He's my fiance, right?

40:08.807 --> 40:11.577
I can't believe
there's no gym here.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.579
-Please tell me there's
a good organic--
-Nope.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.549
At least there's cake.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.986
I'm fine.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.153
I'm okay.

40:29.895 --> 40:32.898
-So, you grew up here?
-Yeah.

40:32.898 --> 40:35.634
The soon-to-be famous
Clarissa Byers,

40:35.634 --> 40:38.570
born and raised right here
in these very halls!

40:38.570 --> 40:41.206
Shh. You're gonna
wake up my parents.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.842
I can never find...

40:43.842 --> 40:46.044
[screaming]

40:46.044 --> 40:49.114
Mom, Dad, I told you
never to do that again.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.016
-Welcome home.
-It's our tradition.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.984
-It's our tradition.
-How you doing?
Good to see you.

40:52.984 --> 40:56.488
She would come home late,
and we'd be hiding
in the dark and go...

40:56.488 --> 40:57.723
like that and scare her
every time.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.024
It's a creepy tradition.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.727
My future son-in-law.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.261
Hello.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.996
Welcome to our home.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.232
Thank you for having me,
Mr. and Mrs. Byers.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.801
No, sir. Bruce and Sandy.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.270
-Bruce and Sandy.
-Yeah.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.272
-Thank you.
-There you go.

41:14.272 --> 41:17.242
Okay, let's
get you settled in.
Right up here.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.944
You know where you're going,
young lady.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.879
And you just follow her.

41:27.686 --> 41:31.022
And creepy fact number two,
they left my room like this.

41:31.022 --> 41:32.891
I think this is awesome.

41:32.891 --> 41:35.827
Every time I go home,
my aunt's turned my room
into a game room

41:35.827 --> 41:39.798
or a yoga studio, or,
as of the most recent visit,

41:39.798 --> 41:42.634
a kennel for foster dogs.

41:42.634 --> 41:46.171
Well, we couldn't change it.
It's not ours to change.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.807
And they're probably
always hoping
I'll move back here.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.711
What kind of parents
would we be if we didn't?

41:53.912 --> 41:56.081
All right.

41:56.081 --> 41:59.785
You kids get some rest
and let us know
if there's anything you need.

41:59.785 --> 42:00.952
Thank you, Mrs.--

42:02.287 --> 42:04.189
Thank you, Sandy.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.024
Hey, you like omelets?

42:06.024 --> 42:07.626
Yes, sir, love 'em.

42:07.626 --> 42:08.760
I make a mean omelet.

42:10.729 --> 42:13.732
-Good night.
-Good night.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.567
-Bye, Mom, bye, Dad.
-Bye.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.606
Yeah, your parents
are pretty awesome.

42:20.606 --> 42:23.174
And you're totally
not sleeping here.

42:23.174 --> 42:26.745
There's a futon
in the study next door
with your name all over it.

42:26.745 --> 42:27.979
All right.

42:30.749 --> 42:33.785
Well, let's just hope
your parents don't find me
on the futon in the morning.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.022
So cute.

42:37.022 --> 42:38.189
Leave it.

42:40.859 --> 42:42.728
-Adorable.
-Thank you.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.635
[Sandy]
You'll figure it out.

42:49.635 --> 42:50.902
[all taking indistinctly]

42:50.902 --> 42:52.237
[all screaming]

42:52.237 --> 42:53.872
[all laughing]

42:57.175 --> 42:59.745
Oh, my God!
That's so funny.

43:04.850 --> 43:06.384
Your guy here,

43:06.384 --> 43:09.020
he has no idea
how to make an omelet.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.789
I can't believe
you didn't teach him.

43:10.789 --> 43:12.991
I taught you
everything I know.

43:12.991 --> 43:15.927
Dad, we haven't had
a lot of sleepovers
that involved breakfast.

43:15.927 --> 43:18.997
You're telling me
this isn't a work of art?

43:18.997 --> 43:22.300
As much as I'd like
to be polite because
you are a guest in our home...

43:23.334 --> 43:25.370
no!

43:25.370 --> 43:27.338
Well, my rule of thumb is
it's not about how it looks,

43:27.338 --> 43:29.107
it's about
how great it tastes.

43:29.107 --> 43:31.209
So, even a messy omelet
can have potential, right?

43:32.644 --> 43:33.812
We'll see.

43:36.715 --> 43:38.717
Mmm!

43:38.717 --> 43:40.886
House of honesty
says, heck yeah!

43:42.353 --> 43:43.822
Your turn.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.695
You're right. It's good.

43:49.695 --> 43:51.362
Yes!

43:51.362 --> 43:53.865
-Good job.
-All right.

43:53.865 --> 43:55.333
[Chas]
I told you I have
some culinary skills.

43:55.333 --> 43:58.003
[Clarissa]
Yeah, you proved me wrong.

43:58.003 --> 44:00.138
All right, so what's on
our big wedding agenda
for the day?

44:00.138 --> 44:04.843
So, we're headed to the beach.
Tonight is the bachelor
and bachelorette parties.

44:04.843 --> 44:06.678
You know, I've actually
never been to one of those.

44:06.678 --> 44:08.446
Well, relax.
It's not like the movies.

44:08.446 --> 44:12.250
It's gonna be probably mostly
junk food, video games
and burping contests.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.985
There's nothing you just said
that I don't like.

44:13.985 --> 44:15.787
I can lift my own suitcase.

44:15.787 --> 44:17.422
Can you also say thank you?

44:28.099 --> 44:29.768
Thank you.

44:29.768 --> 44:31.102
You're welcome.

44:51.790 --> 44:53.424
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

44:53.424 --> 44:56.227
Okay, so I think the guys
are staying in condos over here.

44:56.227 --> 44:58.029
You're in 236.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.831
236. Where are you gonna be?

44:59.831 --> 45:01.432
I'm in 222.

45:01.432 --> 45:04.402
And we're actually
gonna settle in
and then go to the pool

45:04.402 --> 45:06.271
before the bachelor
and bachelorette parties.

45:06.271 --> 45:07.973
All right.

45:07.973 --> 45:09.841
-Cool. Okay, I'll see ya.
-Yeah.

45:11.376 --> 45:12.778
[cell phone vibrates]

45:20.285 --> 45:21.987
Wait. How does
she even know that?

45:21.987 --> 45:23.488
Because I'm right here, darling.

45:27.158 --> 45:28.459
What are you doing here?

45:28.459 --> 45:31.196
Why does she have a ring?

45:31.196 --> 45:33.398
You're the one who wanted us
to play this up, remember?

45:33.398 --> 45:36.401
It was supposed
to look like a fling!
Not a full-on engagement.

45:36.401 --> 45:38.870
I got, I don't know,
carried away
in the scene.

45:38.870 --> 45:40.105
Did you?

45:40.105 --> 45:41.506
Well, it's too late
to take it back now.

45:41.506 --> 45:45.143
And I gave her the ring
my aunt let me borrow,
what's the big deal?

45:45.143 --> 45:47.145
I'm sorry,
why are you here?

45:47.145 --> 45:50.782
I'm your publicist.
It's my job to make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

45:50.782 --> 45:52.217
So far so good.

45:52.217 --> 45:54.185
I didn't have anything better
to do this weekend, so...

45:55.186 --> 45:56.554
Okay.

45:56.554 --> 45:57.923
Fine.

45:57.923 --> 46:00.959
I couldn't stand
the thought of you
way out here alone with her.

46:00.959 --> 46:03.128
Come on, baby,
we talked about this.
You know it's--

46:03.128 --> 46:04.529
Look, here's the plan.

46:04.529 --> 46:07.799
If anyone asks,
I'm your publicist Suzie.

46:07.799 --> 46:09.968
So, the truth?

46:09.968 --> 46:13.538
I'll make sure
not to jump in any photos
and blah, blah, blah.

46:13.538 --> 46:16.374
But don't think for a second
I'm not watching you.

46:16.374 --> 46:18.509
Eyes of a hawk.
Ears of a tiger.

46:20.846 --> 46:23.448
-Got it.
-Good.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.917
Shall we hit the pool?

46:25.917 --> 46:27.819
Yeah. Just give me
a head start?

46:28.920 --> 46:30.121
[Suzie sighs]

46:35.526 --> 46:37.896
Okay, this is so exciting.

46:39.197 --> 46:42.300
So, he proposed
to you at work?

46:43.434 --> 46:45.904
Uh...

46:45.904 --> 46:47.973
I mean, that's what
the tabloids said.

46:47.973 --> 46:50.275
-Well, no. It was more, like--
-And it was a whole thing.

46:50.275 --> 46:52.543
-Yeah, and then it was...
-Totally.

46:52.543 --> 46:54.846
Just wow.

46:54.846 --> 46:56.214
[both]
Aww.

46:56.214 --> 46:58.183
So cute.

46:58.183 --> 47:00.986
Wait, what?
They didn't say anything.

47:00.986 --> 47:03.488
They don't
have to say anything.

47:03.488 --> 47:05.590
So romantic.

47:05.590 --> 47:07.558
I don't know
if that's romantic.

47:07.558 --> 47:09.194
I'm romantic.

47:09.194 --> 47:11.329
Very romantic.

47:11.329 --> 47:12.597
How are you romantic?

47:15.066 --> 47:17.402
I took you to the pier
last week, we got ice cream.

47:17.402 --> 47:20.105
-That's romantic.
-Yeah. Veronica went with us.

47:20.105 --> 47:22.273
Kelly, you don't even
like romance.

47:22.273 --> 47:23.641
How would you know that?

47:23.641 --> 47:25.610
Well, to me,
and I maybe sappy,

47:25.610 --> 47:28.914
but I think
anything can be romantic
with the right person.

47:28.914 --> 47:33.151
The activity doesn't matter
as long as you're with someone
you feel romantic with.

47:33.151 --> 47:34.419
Anything?

47:34.419 --> 47:36.154
Yeah, anything.

47:36.154 --> 47:38.223
I mean, even making breakfast
in the morning
can be romantic.

47:38.223 --> 47:40.058
-Can't it?
-Right.

47:40.058 --> 47:44.362
Everyone knows that
French toast is
the most romantic of toasts.

47:44.362 --> 47:47.232
Chas makes great omelets.

47:47.232 --> 47:48.599
You should make omelets, too.

47:48.599 --> 47:50.601
Come on!

47:50.601 --> 47:53.438
Guys, get my back here.

47:53.438 --> 47:56.374
-Bros before...
-What?

47:58.910 --> 48:00.011
What?

48:00.011 --> 48:01.947
No, no, no.
"Bros before" what?

48:05.050 --> 48:08.553
Hey, everyone.
I'd like you to meet
my publicist, Suzie.

48:08.553 --> 48:11.489
She just coming by
to make sure
everything's good, you know.

48:11.489 --> 48:13.524
Hi, guys!

48:13.524 --> 48:15.260
Look at you.

48:15.260 --> 48:18.429
You're all so cute,
and all-American.

48:18.429 --> 48:22.000
And this is
my fiance, Clarissa.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.970
Clarissa, so nice
to finally meet you.

48:24.970 --> 48:27.105
Chas has said
so many good things.

48:27.105 --> 48:29.407
Nice to meet you, too, Suzie.

48:29.407 --> 48:32.010
So many good things.

48:32.010 --> 48:34.012
You, too.

48:34.012 --> 48:36.714
Okay. You've
officially shaken.

48:36.714 --> 48:38.216
Well.

48:38.216 --> 48:41.252
I think I might go
dip my toes in the water.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.221
Anyone care to join me?

48:47.158 --> 48:49.560
Is that the stripper
for the bachelor party?

48:51.029 --> 48:53.064
Well, Suzie's welcome
to join us if she wants

48:53.064 --> 48:54.332
at the bachelorette
party tonight.

48:54.332 --> 48:56.601
-No.
-No, no, no.

48:56.601 --> 48:58.069
[Suzie]
I'd love to!

48:59.170 --> 49:00.305
Okay.

49:05.676 --> 49:07.245
[chattering]

49:07.245 --> 49:08.579
[laughing]

49:13.718 --> 49:16.087
Have you ever met
that publicist before?

49:16.087 --> 49:18.356
Not before today.
But she's big in the biz.

49:18.356 --> 49:22.227
Well, she was getting
really flirty with your fiance
at the beach this afternoon.

49:22.227 --> 49:24.295
And she's gorgeous.

49:24.295 --> 49:27.065
-And she's flirty.
-Very flirty.

49:27.065 --> 49:28.733
Relax, you guys.

49:28.733 --> 49:32.203
She's married
to this handsome,
big-time agent in LA.

49:32.203 --> 49:34.072
And she's not the first girl
to flirt with Chas.

49:34.072 --> 49:36.707
Girls flirt with him
all the time,
you two included.

49:36.707 --> 49:38.343
I'm not really worried
about it.

49:38.343 --> 49:40.645
Or maybe you're just
a really good actress.

49:40.645 --> 49:44.582
You know, he's dated
a lot of girls.

49:44.582 --> 49:46.517
I know. But, I mean,

49:46.517 --> 49:49.154
he never makes me feel insecure,
so I'm not worried about it.

49:49.154 --> 49:51.322
Wow.

49:51.322 --> 49:53.591
A lot's changed
since high school.

49:53.591 --> 49:55.360
What are you talking about?

49:55.360 --> 49:59.397
I don't know. I mean,
you used to be, like...
really insecure.

49:59.397 --> 50:01.599
No, I'm not. Wasn't.

50:01.599 --> 50:04.035
I wasn't.

50:04.035 --> 50:06.737
Come on, Riss.
You were super insecure.

50:06.737 --> 50:09.640
You never went out
with anybody.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.742
You buried yourself
in, like...

50:11.742 --> 50:16.681
-In, like, you know,
the drama club, the clarinet.
-Yeah.

50:16.681 --> 50:21.486
The jazz choir, you know.
You did everything.

50:21.486 --> 50:23.521
I hung out with Graham
all the time.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.591
Yeah. But you used him
to feel better
about yourself.

50:26.591 --> 50:28.793
Is that what
you're doing to him now?

50:28.793 --> 50:32.463
Don't turn this around
on me. Graham and I
are doing just fine.

50:33.698 --> 50:35.833
I just really worry about you.

50:35.833 --> 50:38.169
What is that
supposed to mean?

50:38.169 --> 50:40.805
Come on.
He's... Chas Hunter.

50:42.107 --> 50:43.674
And... And you're...

50:46.511 --> 50:48.713
you know, you.

50:48.713 --> 50:51.316
Can't imagine
why I'm insecure
with friends like you.

50:51.316 --> 50:54.852
I'm not trying
to pick a fight here.
I'm just saying...

50:54.852 --> 50:59.390
He's really good-looking,
and I'd understand
if you felt insecure.

50:59.390 --> 51:02.059
I just don't want to see
you sabotage anything.

51:03.394 --> 51:04.862
You're wrong.

51:04.862 --> 51:06.631
About you and Chas?

51:06.631 --> 51:09.200
No, about how
things have changed.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.169
You're still playing games,

51:11.169 --> 51:13.504
stupid, little
high school games.

51:15.406 --> 51:16.741
[mutters]

51:16.741 --> 51:18.075
Hey, guys.

51:20.445 --> 51:22.147
Hey, where'd Riss go?

51:23.681 --> 51:26.251
She needed to take
a walk I think.

51:31.889 --> 51:33.391
Hey!

51:33.391 --> 51:35.260
-What are you doing here?
-Hey.

51:37.328 --> 51:39.697
I came in search of ice.

51:39.697 --> 51:41.666
How about you?
What are you doing here?

51:41.666 --> 51:44.269
You're the maid of honor,
shouldn't you be off...

51:44.269 --> 51:46.204
leading the party
or something?

51:46.204 --> 51:50.675
Yeah, apparently that honor
has been crowned
to your publicist, Suzie.

51:50.675 --> 51:52.343
She sure knows
how to have a good time.

51:54.679 --> 51:57.282
She's the one
you're seeing, right?

52:01.619 --> 52:03.721
You mad?

52:03.721 --> 52:06.324
-I'm not.
-Well, you seem mad.

52:06.324 --> 52:07.792
They just got to me.

52:09.394 --> 52:11.262
High school drama
rearing its ugly head,

52:11.262 --> 52:12.763
and Kelly doing
her devil's duty

52:12.763 --> 52:16.501
to make me feel bad
about myself...
like she always does.

52:16.501 --> 52:17.668
Yeah. Thank you.

52:20.571 --> 52:22.139
Is she jealous?

52:23.208 --> 52:24.675
Wow. You have an ego.

52:24.675 --> 52:28.213
I didn't mean about me.
I meant about Graham.

52:28.213 --> 52:29.780
See the way
he looks at you, like...

52:30.915 --> 52:32.417
You picked up on that?

52:33.884 --> 52:36.221
I'm not quite as self-involved
as you might think.

52:36.221 --> 52:39.457
I am capable
of observing, too.

52:39.457 --> 52:41.292
Yeah.

52:41.292 --> 52:43.561
We used to be close
and then we weren't.

52:44.729 --> 52:47.198
It just ended.
I don't know.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.867
We were young,
I was stupid, and...

52:52.237 --> 52:54.305
He told me he loved me
and I freaked out.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.541
It happens.

52:57.675 --> 52:59.810
Yeah.

52:59.810 --> 53:02.780
Yeah, got kind of weird at
the rehearsal dinner last night.

53:05.483 --> 53:08.353
You think he's just
with her because he...

53:08.353 --> 53:09.454
can't be with you?

53:10.655 --> 53:12.590
I don't know.

53:12.590 --> 53:15.260
I hope not. I mean, I hope
he's not just settling.

53:20.965 --> 53:23.501
You think people always find
their perfect match?

53:24.902 --> 53:26.837
My mom and dad did.

53:26.837 --> 53:30.875
Well, they certainly
gave you high standards,
that's good.

53:30.875 --> 53:33.611
I don't think
it was as easy for them
as you think.

53:33.611 --> 53:36.947
I bet they had to
work pretty hard
for what they have.

53:36.947 --> 53:38.983
Think all relationships do.

53:41.819 --> 53:44.355
Wish my parents
worked harder sometimes.

53:49.927 --> 53:52.730
Then I guess
what matters is...

53:52.730 --> 53:55.966
how do you feel about him?

53:55.966 --> 53:59.737
Yeah, I mean,
I had feelings for him, but...

53:59.737 --> 54:03.941
I don't know.
I was... insecure,
or just not mature enough,

54:03.941 --> 54:05.876
or maybe just not ready.

54:05.876 --> 54:08.446
I don't know.
Maybe all three?

54:11.749 --> 54:13.484
What about now?

54:15.286 --> 54:17.455
He's different.

54:17.455 --> 54:20.858
I'm different. I don't know.
It's not like it used to be.

54:20.858 --> 54:23.461
It's 'cause
you broke his heart.

54:23.461 --> 54:24.662
Little heartbreaker.

54:28.366 --> 54:32.403
I got to admit,
this is not quite as bad
as I thought it would be.

54:32.403 --> 54:34.639
It's actually been kind of fun.

54:34.639 --> 54:37.475
Yeah, it's definitely
gone better than I expected.

54:37.475 --> 54:39.777
You, too, for the record.

54:39.777 --> 54:42.313
Sorry if I gave you
a hard time before.

54:42.313 --> 54:45.583
I wasn't exactly
a distinguished gentleman
around you, either.

54:49.620 --> 54:53.023
Personally, I think we kind of
like teasing each other.

54:53.023 --> 54:54.959
That is what engaged
couples do, after all.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.527
Mm-hmm.

54:58.863 --> 55:00.030
So...

55:02.400 --> 55:04.602
where we going
on our honeymoon?

55:07.372 --> 55:08.939
It's kind of silly,

55:08.939 --> 55:11.909
but you know
what I always thought
would be a fun honeymoon?

55:11.909 --> 55:13.378
What's that?

55:13.378 --> 55:15.913
A road trip
across the States,
in an RV.

55:15.913 --> 55:20.918
Just camping, and cooking,
and seeing the sights.
Just simple.

55:20.918 --> 55:23.921
Slumming it through
middle America.
A big camp-out.

55:25.356 --> 55:26.524
Yeah, I'm down.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.662
So you think
the party's still going on?

55:31.662 --> 55:33.564
Yeah. I should
probably check on Maya.

55:33.564 --> 55:35.065
She never stays up
past midnight.

55:35.065 --> 55:38.369
And I bet she's passed out
on the couch, especially
after all that wine.

55:39.470 --> 55:40.571
Come on.

55:46.744 --> 55:50.615
Okay, so... at what time are
we supposed to leave tomorrow?

55:50.615 --> 55:54.552
I think, like, 10?
The wedding is at 5, so...

55:54.552 --> 55:55.586
All right.

55:56.987 --> 55:58.789
Well...

55:58.789 --> 56:00.625
thank you for a nice night.

56:00.625 --> 56:01.892
Yeah, you, too.

56:07.565 --> 56:08.766
[softly]
Wow.

56:19.444 --> 56:21.045
[door opening]

56:26.050 --> 56:28.118
-What?
-Are you coming
to the wedding or not?

56:29.654 --> 56:32.056
Now you're marrying her?

56:32.056 --> 56:34.792
The other wedding.
Yeah, get ready.

56:34.792 --> 56:36.393
[groans]

56:44.201 --> 56:45.603
[Suzie groaning]

56:50.875 --> 56:54.945
You'll have to start planning
for your big day soon.

56:54.945 --> 56:57.181
Yeah, I guess so, huh?

56:57.181 --> 56:58.949
Do you happen to have
any painkillers?

57:00.117 --> 57:02.753
Vicodin would be great.

57:02.753 --> 57:06.491
Uh... I have some aspirin
in the medicine cabinet
in the bathroom.

57:06.491 --> 57:08.493
[Suzie sighs]

57:08.493 --> 57:09.627
Fine.

57:10.895 --> 57:12.463
-I need eight.
-Okay.

57:12.463 --> 57:14.832
-I can get it for you.
-No, no, I'll manage.

57:17.702 --> 57:19.804
I need to touch up
my make-up, anyway.

57:19.804 --> 57:21.872
The humidity here
makes my face melt.

57:26.544 --> 57:28.012
Have you talked about
where you'll have it?

57:28.012 --> 57:29.880
No, not yet.

57:29.880 --> 57:31.482
Where'd you guys have yours?

57:34.619 --> 57:36.654
-We eloped.
-Really?

57:36.654 --> 57:38.789
Her folks weren't too happy
about us getting married.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.592
Yeah. They said that
Bruce lacked ambition.

57:41.592 --> 57:43.160
You know,
I didn't care though.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.596
But now,
the lack of ambition

57:45.596 --> 57:49.266
has landed him
the senior VP position
in community development

57:49.266 --> 57:51.669
at his firm.

57:51.669 --> 57:53.871
Being with you
made me try harder.

57:55.873 --> 57:59.944
Clarissa is really lucky
to have parents
like you, you know that?

57:59.944 --> 58:02.580
And she's lucky
to have a guy like you
in her life.

58:03.781 --> 58:05.850
Mm. I can tell by the eyes.

58:07.117 --> 58:08.252
Tell what?

58:08.252 --> 58:10.821
That you, Mr. Hunter...

58:10.821 --> 58:12.523
are a good one.

58:16.226 --> 58:17.494
Honey!

58:19.229 --> 58:21.599
Oh! Honey!

58:24.134 --> 58:25.269
Wow.

58:26.637 --> 58:28.639
You look amazing.

58:28.639 --> 58:30.040
Thanks.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.676
Are we ready to go?

58:31.676 --> 58:33.277
I'm here, I'm here.

58:35.145 --> 58:36.914
[Suzie sighs]

58:37.982 --> 58:39.216
Let's rock.

58:58.669 --> 59:00.237
Oh, so beautiful.

59:02.306 --> 59:04.742
Wow! Maya, you look amazing.

59:04.742 --> 59:05.910
Doesn't she?

59:05.910 --> 59:07.277
Takes after her mom.

59:09.279 --> 59:11.248
Audrey, can I
borrow you a minute?

59:12.349 --> 59:14.284
-Mom, it's fine. Go.
-Okay.

59:17.121 --> 59:19.123
Hey. What happened
to you last night?

59:20.925 --> 59:24.895
I got into it with Kelly
over the whole Graham thing.
It was dumb.

59:24.895 --> 59:26.897
Big surprise.

59:26.897 --> 59:30.935
Anyway, I'm so sorry
I bailed there at the end,
it was lame of me.

59:30.935 --> 59:32.436
It's okay.

59:32.436 --> 59:35.272
I came back an hour later,
but you were already
passed out on the couch.

59:36.874 --> 59:38.075
I know.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.310
So, where'd you head off to?

59:40.310 --> 59:43.714
I ran into Chas, and
we just talked for a while.

59:44.949 --> 59:49.687
Mm-hmm. Sure. You talked
for a little while.

59:49.687 --> 59:53.190
Anyway, what did you guys do
after I left?

59:53.190 --> 59:54.792
I have no clue.

59:54.792 --> 59:56.694
Honestly, the last thing
I remember

59:56.694 --> 01:00:01.031
was Suzie yanking that tiara off
my head or something like that.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:04.201
Well, for someone
who's hurting,
you sure do clean up well.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.302
Thank you.

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:09.306
I do look beautiful,
don't I?

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:17.748
Wow, I can't believe
this day is really happening.

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:21.018
We would talk about this
so much when we were little.

01:00:21.018 --> 01:00:24.221
Remember, we used
to take those white
sheets off my mom's bed

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:27.324
and we would wrap them
around ourselves and
make them our wedding dresses,

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.393
and then use
the pillow cases as veils.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:31.295
Yes, I remember.

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:34.298
And I remember
how you would always
give me the fitted sheets

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:36.133
because they were
too crinkly for you.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:43.007
And I remember how you'd
always say you were going
to get married before me.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:44.274
-Remember that?
-Yeah.

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:46.844
Because you were
such a total wild child.

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.378
I know.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:54.284
Well, I have a feeling
that somebody
isn't too far behind me.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:56.787
Maya, listen,
there's something I need--

01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:57.922
[Kelly]
Hey, guys.

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:01.125
My! Look at you!

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:04.428
You look so beautiful.

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:09.767
I can't express how
beautiful I think you look
without cursing in a church,

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.969
so I'll just shut up.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.374
All right, ladies,
five minutes and counting.

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:19.376
Let's get our things
organized, shall we?

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:22.913
Okay.

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:26.016
Okay. This is it.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.954
This is... really it.

01:01:29.954 --> 01:01:33.390
You're gonna nail it,
just like you did
when we were kids,

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.225
crinkly fitted sheets and all.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.331
[guests cheering]

01:01:45.102 --> 01:01:48.372
What's all this?
Did your mom get
more photographers?

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:51.241
[male reporter]
Clarissa, are you and
Chas Hunter married now?

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:52.843
No, no, this wasn't
my wedding.

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:54.745
This is my friend,
Maya's wedding.

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:57.915
Clarissa, is Chas here?
We know he's staying in town.

01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:00.985
Yeah, Chas is here.
We're having
a wonderful time.

01:02:00.985 --> 01:02:03.453
But if you guys wouldn't mind
letting my friends
enjoy their wedding day,

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:05.122
we kind of
need to get past?

01:02:10.795 --> 01:02:12.262
Over here. Over here.

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:17.968
[jazz music playing]

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:20.838
[cell phone ringing]

01:02:22.006 --> 01:02:23.373
Hey, Jeannette,
what's up?

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:24.809
How's the reception?

01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:26.310
It's great.

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:29.213
I mean, it's winding down now,
but everyone had a lot of fun.

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:32.850
I see that the
paparazzi are already
posting photos online.

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.985
Chas isn't even in them.

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:36.821
You're kind of famous now, huh?

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:39.389
Yeah. Probably
because I look like I'm
freaking out in every photo.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:43.260
I swear they, like,
hide in the bushes and
jump out at the worst moment.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.594
Well, get used to it, honey.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:49.066
Because you
have nine auditions
when you get back next week.

01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:52.536
Two features,
three reoccurring,
and four commercials.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:54.271
Just for you, hon.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.372
Seriously?

01:02:57.407 --> 01:03:00.410
Nine auditions?
That's amazing.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.947
Well, that's the biz for ya.

01:03:02.947 --> 01:03:07.284
All right, you go have fun
and I will see you back here
next week, okay?

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.853
Yeah. Thanks, Jeannette.

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:13.557
Hey, I didn't hear you there.

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:17.227
It's probably
the buzz of excitement from
your nine upcoming auditions.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.364
You heard?

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:22.466
Well, first
I heard the scream.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:25.069
And then...
the nine auditions.

01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:27.204
I'm happy for you, Riss.

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:28.472
You deserve it.

01:03:29.974 --> 01:03:32.242
And you look
stunning tonight.

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:34.578
Thanks, Graham.
You look great, too.

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:35.913
Thank you.

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.284
What are you doing, Riss?

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.921
Looking for paparazzi.

01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:50.527
I know, okay?
I know all about this.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:53.530
Suzie was tipsy,
I don't know half
of what she was saying.

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:57.567
But she did tell me
that everything between
you and Chas is a sham.

01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:01.906
No, no, no.
See... It's...

01:04:01.906 --> 01:04:03.540
Riss.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.942
Please.

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:09.379
Okay.

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:15.585
So, the truth is...

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:18.355
I lost this big job in LA.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:23.660
And I really didn't want
everyone here to know
that I was a failure, so...

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:28.065
One lie just led to another,
and then to another,
and then I just...

01:04:29.934 --> 01:04:33.037
You just... realized
you actually like him.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:37.074
What? No. No, no. no.

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:39.543
-No?
-No, no. Definitely not.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:44.614
He's not my type.
He's got a really crazy life.

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:48.085
You remember
that thing you told me?

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:50.320
About how I should let myself
get closer to Kelly?

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:54.358
It stuck with me,
and you're right.

01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:58.095
You should
take your own advice.

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:00.897
It's different.

01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:03.433
You don't know that.

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:08.538
You two could have something.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.508
Something great.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.045
Really?

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:18.148
Really.

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:23.020
I mean, not that that dude
could ever be as cool as me,

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:26.090
but...

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:27.324
he could try.

01:05:31.195 --> 01:05:34.264
I'm glad...
that we never dated.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.001
'Cause I never wanna lose...
my best friend.

01:05:41.038 --> 01:05:43.373

-Yeah. Well, bye.

[soft jazz music playing]

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:54.985
Hey, I've been
looking for you.

01:05:54.985 --> 01:05:57.021
Well, you've found me.
What's up?

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:59.056
Thought I'd ask you to dance.

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:00.557
-You did?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:05.295
Yeah. I was dancing
with Veronica, but she's
kind of got two left feet,

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:09.599
and she strangely
asked me to sign
her bridesmaids' dress, so...

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.735
I'm kind of exhausted.

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:16.340
It's probably for the best.
Probably too much
for you to handle.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.674
Is that so?

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:21.011
I used to dance
when I was younger,
so, I'm pretty awesome.

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:23.280
Well, I think I'll be
the judge of that.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:26.716
-I'll try to keep up.
-Okay.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.224
-You are pretty good.
-You, too.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:36.460
Well, I've taken
a bit of dance myself.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.028
Fancy.

[slow piano music playing]

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.998
So, now that you're
a big-time celebrity...

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:45.369
what do you think
of the press?

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:48.272
It... kind of sucks.

01:06:48.272 --> 01:06:52.376
It feels like I stole
my best friends' thunder
on her wedding day.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:55.145
But I don't know.
I don't know if I can ever
be a superstar, though.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:56.413
It must be tough.

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:58.448
You kind of get used to it
after a while.

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:02.686
It's just a bunch of
lights, camera, action.

01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:20.604
Sorry. Didn't plan that part.

01:07:22.106 --> 01:07:24.608

you're seeing?

01:07:24.608 --> 01:07:26.243
Right. Yeah.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:29.213
Yeah. I guess I just...

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:31.781
Caught up in the moment.

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:34.551
I know.

leads to me booking

I really can never thank you.

I guess.

I needed it.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.559

you had a good time.

Yeah? Coming home?

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:27.337
Partly.
Mainly I guess from myself.

-Remember that argument
I had with Kelly?
-Yeah.

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:33.477
It was about
how insecure I used to be
when I was younger.

01:08:33.477 --> 01:08:37.247
And, I don't know,
when I'm with you,
I don't feel that way.

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.916
I mean, I should,
but I don't.

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:42.786
Nobody should ever make
anybody else feel insecure.

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:45.555
We do enough of that
to ourselves every day.

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:47.357
True.

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:48.558
[Suzie gasping]

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:51.895
[Suzie]
Oh, my God!

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:53.630
Chas! Chas!

01:08:55.299 --> 01:08:56.733
Randall and Alicia!

01:08:56.733 --> 01:09:00.237
My PI caught them
making out at a day spa!

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:01.738
And he got photos! Look!

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:05.642
Ew.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:06.676
So gross.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.345
But isn't that fantastic?

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:13.683
Now I can get a divorce,
and you and I can be
insanely rich together.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.354
Her and her husband, it's...

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.724
kind of a weird thing.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:22.759
Okay, I guess it's over now.

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:24.928
What? You don't owe her
an explanation.

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:27.331
-Let's just get it over with.
-What?

01:09:27.331 --> 01:09:30.734
The big break up.
It's perfect,
at a wedding.

01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:32.435
It works on so many levels.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.406
Suzie, can you just
give me a minute here?

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:37.407
Sure, sure, yeah.

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:40.743
Get into character.
Find your moment before.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.746
Then break up.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.515
Just give me the ring.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:47.850
The ring?

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:48.917
You're marrying her?

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:50.453
-No.
-No.

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.725
You want this? Fine.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:58.862
Take it.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:01.531
It's just a prop
anyway, right?
For this whole act.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:04.268
Okay. The scene is set.
Let's go.

01:10:04.268 --> 01:10:05.502
Wait.

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:06.970
We need witnesses.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:11.308
People!
Hey, people, get over here!
Yeah. Come on.

01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:16.846
We need to make sure
someone gets photos.
Hold on.

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:20.584
No, no.
You wanted to do this.
Let's do this.

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:23.687
Let's give them the big show,
the big finish!

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.257
Clarissa, you don't
have to do this.

01:10:27.257 --> 01:10:29.993
Yeah, I do.
It was the deal, right?

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:31.995
Deal?

01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:34.798
No improving.
Stick with the scene.

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:36.700
Riss, what is
she talking about?

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.006
Clarissa was helping me
out of a mess.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.276
Right.

01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:48.945
Good ol' Riss.
Always here to help.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.549
You guys were right.

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:55.952
Chas would never go for me.
He's way out of my league.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:58.054
That's not true.

01:10:58.054 --> 01:10:59.823
True? True?

01:10:59.823 --> 01:11:02.926
None of this is true.
None of this is real.

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.861
This is just a fantasy.

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:05.995
Fantasy?

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:09.899
Our relationship. This plan.

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:13.337
Even your relationship
with Suzie is probably
just another fantasy.

01:11:13.337 --> 01:11:14.838
I get it. I do.

01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:16.440
You grew up on a TV show.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:21.545
So, the places weren't real.
The people weren't real.
The words weren't real.

01:11:21.545 --> 01:11:22.779
Maybe you're right.

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:26.850
Maybe I do live
in a fantasy world,

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.486
but I know how I feel.

01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:31.855
And I know what I like.

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:33.857
It's not a loser like me.

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:35.559
Clarissa, you're not a loser.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:39.028
You're just saying that
because I lied to you.

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:40.597
No, she knew.

01:11:40.597 --> 01:11:41.765
You knew?

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:44.501
I'm your best friend,
of course I knew.

01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:47.671
But if you felt the need
to lie to me,
I wasn't going to stop you.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:50.707
I just didn't understand why.

01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:52.942
Why? Why?

01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:56.813
Because I messed up, guys.

01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.984
I'm not famous.
I'm not dating a superstar.

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:03.753
I had a role in a film
and I blew it!

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:06.656
I didn't want to come home
and be a failure again.

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:10.560
I screwed that up too.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:22.939
Hey, sweetie.

01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:26.009
-Did you have fun
last night?
-Yeah, it was a great time.

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:28.412
Yeah? Sounds like it.

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:31.948
What happened?

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:36.085
Where's your ring?

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:40.657
Chas was seeing Suzie,
and she's married
and getting divorced,

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:42.726
and it looked bad,
so they asked me to cover.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.966
It was supposed to be
so simple, and then
it just went crazy.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.801
Like, super crazy.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:54.904
And then,
everyone knows now,
and I look dumb,

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:58.007
so I just want to sit here,
eat my pancakes and die.

01:12:58.007 --> 01:12:59.943
You lied to me.

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:05.081
Yeah, Mom, I lied.

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:08.885
I'm sorry.
I really messed up.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.454
Where's Chas now?

01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:14.858
I don't know.
We're not engaged.

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:17.694
Well, not yet.

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:21.565
Don't give me that look.

01:13:21.565 --> 01:13:23.433
You like him.

01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:25.435
He likes you.

01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:28.438
He has a girlfriend.
Or whatever she is.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:33.677
Well, I had a boyfriend
when I met your dad.

01:13:33.677 --> 01:13:34.811
What?

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:36.446
Gross. No.

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:41.184
Yes, I had a boyfriend!

01:13:41.184 --> 01:13:44.020
His name was Oliver.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.491
He was studying
to be a doctor.
He was really handsome, too.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:50.927
Bruce and I were just friends.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:54.130
I think we met
at a Halloween party.
Yeah, that's right.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:57.100
Oliver wasn't there that night
because he had to
work all night.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.503
And then the two of you
fell in love.

01:13:59.503 --> 01:14:03.206
No. No, no.
It wasn't quite like that.

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:07.511
We didn't date
for quite some time.
I think maybe a month.

01:14:07.511 --> 01:14:12.181
Yeah, a month after that.
But we were good friends,
great friends.

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:15.752
Yeah. Well, what did Dad have
that Oliver didn't have?

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.089
Your dad...

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.560
Nothing.

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:27.731
But together...

01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:30.233
Together we had
something special.

01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:34.170
Together we had fun.
We had magic.

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:38.708
And that's what I see
with you and Chas.

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:41.645
It's different. I mean,
you and Dad are perfect
for each other, Mom.

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:47.150
Now.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:51.120
But back then, no,
things were different.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.724
With the laughter
comes the tears,
comes the fighting.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:55.892
All the stuff.

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:01.197
Honey...

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:06.069
nothing...

01:15:06.069 --> 01:15:08.905
starts out perfect.

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:12.776
If it did...
If it did, you'd be bored.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:18.014
The special things
you have to work at.

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:21.618
You have to fight
for those special things.

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:26.055
But the perfect things,
those are the things
you've earned.

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:28.224
I really am sorry about lying.

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:29.959
I understand.

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:34.664
And truth be told, I...

01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:38.835
I was very upset...

01:15:38.835 --> 01:15:42.672
Very upset to hear that
you had gotten engaged
without us meeting him.

01:15:44.774 --> 01:15:46.576
Next time
you'll meet him first.

01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:48.912
No.

01:15:48.912 --> 01:15:50.847
I already have.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:53.116
Mom, I'm not
marrying Chas.

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:54.317
Not yet.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:59.022
-Hey, Dad.
-Hi, guys.

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:03.126
[knock on door]

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:04.227
Come in.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:08.732
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.002
Come here.
Come sit with me.

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:18.808
Shouldn't you be
on your honeymoon right now?

01:16:18.808 --> 01:16:20.644
We leave
in a couple of hours.

01:16:20.644 --> 01:16:23.112
You know I wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye
to you first.

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:24.748
Like I did last night?

01:16:24.748 --> 01:16:28.351
Stop, okay?
I'm not mad at you.

01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:31.621
I mean, I am mad,
but not for last night.

01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:33.990
I'm mad because
you just didn't
trust me enough

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.825
to tell me the truth
in the first place.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.095
I can see how
you'd feel distant, though,

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:42.065
because of the whole
Kelly and maid-of-honor thing.

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:44.868
I should've stuck up for you
when she was being
a pain in the butt.

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:47.003
No, Maya, you are great!

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:49.405
I am the worst
maid of honor ever.

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:52.709
No, you're not, okay.
You're the best.

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:55.745
And... I loved the gift
you gave me.

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.013
I cried when I opened it.

01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:00.216
-Did you really?
-Yeah.

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:02.752
A framed photo
of the Rockefeller
Christmas Tree

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:04.320
where Peter first proposed?

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.056
Even Peter cried.

01:17:10.794 --> 01:17:13.129
Come here.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:15.799
Even when you're a mess,
you're still
the bestest friend ever.

01:17:15.799 --> 01:17:18.034
No, you are.

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:20.403
And speaking of good gifts.

01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:24.407
Chas got us two plane tickets,
an all-inclusive stay
at Napa Valley.

01:17:26.743 --> 01:17:29.178
That is amazing.
I didn't know.

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:32.048
Well, he said that
it's from both of you.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:35.952
Yeah, well,
he didn't tell me.

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:38.087
He's a good guy, Clarissa.

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:40.223
I know. But he's taken.

01:17:40.223 --> 01:17:43.827
So, what are you gonna do
when you get back to LA?

01:17:43.827 --> 01:17:45.729
I'm gonna do
what I always do.

01:17:45.729 --> 01:17:49.365
Enjoy the California sun,
go on some auditions,
and hope for the best.

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:50.499
And that's
my maid of my honor.

01:17:52.368 --> 01:17:56.806
And... there's somebody else
who wants to talk to you.

01:17:56.806 --> 01:17:58.141
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:10.987
Hey, listen, I'm really sorry
for the way I've been.

01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:15.224
Well, always I guess.

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:20.363
Like, I talked to
Graham last night
for a long time

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:24.167
and... if I'm the reason
that you or him...

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:27.136
or anyone else felt insecure
back in high school or now...

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:31.908
I really can't
apologize enough.

01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:33.309
Kelly, it's okay.

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:37.246
I know, I know!
But, look, I promise
I'm gonna get better, okay?

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:41.417
You know, it's just I...

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:43.319
I get jealous of you
sometimes, you know?

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:48.224
I admire you
for chasing your dreams,
and sometimes...

01:18:49.826 --> 01:18:51.895
I wish I had been as brave.

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.232
Thanks, Kelly. I mean,
that really means a lot.

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:01.905
And, hey, you're gonna be
a big star, you know that?

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:07.043
And you're gonna
find a great guy.

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:08.812
Like you did.

01:19:08.812 --> 01:19:09.846
Yeah.

01:19:12.348 --> 01:19:13.917
I'm so jealous.

01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:15.151
[softly]
They made up!

01:19:16.352 --> 01:19:18.788
We want to visit you
this summer too.

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:20.223
After my honeymoon.

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.427
-Girls' weekend?
-Sounds perfect.

01:19:30.834 --> 01:19:35.905
So, you had that
3 p.m. audition on Tuesday,
which I had to cancel.

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:37.240
No, why?

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.076
You are booked
for a six-episode
reoccurring role

01:19:40.076 --> 01:19:44.013
that may go to series regular
if the response on you
is good.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:45.481
I should have the script
very soon.

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:49.853
Seriously? I mean,
not even an audition?

01:19:49.853 --> 01:19:52.388
Nope. This one
is all yours, baby.

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:55.591
Wow. I mean,
he must have been
reading the news.

01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:57.326
It must've been
because of all the press.

01:19:57.326 --> 01:19:59.562
No. Not at all.
I asked him.

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:03.199
He didn't even realize
that you were the same girl.

01:20:03.199 --> 01:20:06.169
So, you're saying
I did this one
all on my own?

01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:08.104
Well, I worked out
all the deal points,

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:11.174
but, yes, ma'am,
you most certainly did.

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:13.309
Wow! Thank you
so much, Jeannette!

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:17.013
This is so crazy.

01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:19.482
So, if I were you,
I would go
to that job of yours

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:22.852
and give them
your two-week notice
as soon as possible.

01:20:26.522 --> 01:20:27.590
Wow.

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:35.231
Hey!

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:39.402
So how does it feel
to be working your last shift
at the good ol' diner?

01:20:39.402 --> 01:20:43.172
Well, it feels like
a good chapter of my life
is finally coming to a close.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:45.208
But I'm gonna miss you, lady.

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:46.575
And the paparazzi.

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:49.078
Mostly the paparazzi.

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:50.846
We haven't had any
in a while.

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:55.218
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:06.362
Hey, how are you?

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:07.563
I...

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:09.465
just wanted to say
congratulations.

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:12.135
For what?

01:21:12.135 --> 01:21:14.470
Well, I heard about
the new show
you just booked.

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:16.505
And actually
my new agent asked

01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:21.144
if I wouldn't mind seeing
if you would
take a meeting with her.

01:21:21.144 --> 01:21:23.346
How could I say no?

01:21:23.346 --> 01:21:25.915
Well, you know,
I am pretty busy these days.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:30.019
But I'd love to.
Thank you.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:32.956
You have a minute
for a coffee?

01:21:34.057 --> 01:21:35.224
Yeah.

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:45.268
So, how is Suzie?

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:47.403
She's good. She's...

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.139
Just...

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:51.674
Just planning the trip
she's gonna take

01:21:51.674 --> 01:21:54.343
with all the alimony
she's about to get.

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:55.678
That's great.
Where are you guys going?

01:21:58.214 --> 01:22:00.383
Not sure about her.

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.318
My only plan
was to come here.

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:03.686
And I figured
you'd be quitting soon,

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.654
I wanted to make sure
I didn't miss you.

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:08.357
Well, yeah, it's my last day.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:10.926
Well, then I'm very glad
I made it.

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:15.431
Just gonna...
leave these here.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.236
Okay. All right. Okay.

01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:23.506
Man, we put on
a heck of a performance
for everyone, didn't we?

01:22:23.506 --> 01:22:24.740
Yeah.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.075
Yeah, we did.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:29.645
So, what now?

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:34.283
No scripts
or stories anymore. Just...

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:37.653
Just you and me.

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:38.988
Good.

01:22:40.123 --> 01:22:42.025
I'm Clarissa Byers.

01:22:42.025 --> 01:22:45.594
I'm Chas Hunter.
Pleasure to
meet you, Clarissa.

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:49.298
You know, it's funny,
I actually used to be
engaged to a Clarissa.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:51.100
She was pretty great.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.469
Think you'd like her.

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:57.706
That's crazy.
Because I was engaged
to a Chas once, too.

01:22:57.706 --> 01:23:00.443
He was one of the most
amazing men I ever met.

01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:03.746
Once you got past
all the paparazzi.

01:23:06.349 --> 01:23:09.418
So, can I get you two
anything else?

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:13.756
I think I've got
everything I need
right here in front of me.

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:19.995

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:39.448
* When her eyes
are shining brightly
You forget about the dark *

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:42.585
* Some things in this life
are priceless *

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:45.288

she's like an angel *

it's heavenly *

01:23:51.494 --> 01:23:54.563

true love is fiction *

01:23:54.563 --> 01:23:56.699
* But I'm starting
to believe *

01:23:56.699 --> 01:24:01.137
* I just fell in love
with a girl *

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:04.240

Beat in my heart *

01:24:32.868 --> 01:24:35.771
* There's something down deep
Deep in my soul

01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:39.108
* That I just can't explain

01:24:39.108 --> 01:24:41.577
* And when I know
that you feel *

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:44.747
* And I know
that you're mine *

01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:50.186

Everyday that I'm alive *
