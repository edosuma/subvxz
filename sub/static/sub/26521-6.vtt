Somehow, Baby Corp's biggest secret,

00:51.468 --> 00:55.055
the existence of Stinkless Serum,
got leaked to our old enemies,

00:55.930 --> 00:56.806
Puppy Co.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.769
Heroically, my team and I
managed to fend off their agent

01:00.852 --> 01:02.187
and save the serum.

That's where my team comes in.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.659
We are in the process of "borrowing"
a very special key.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.871
One that will allow us to access
the Chewpie Tracker.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.372
Little-known fact,

01:21.581 --> 01:24.042
Baby Corp keeps a log
of every chewpie transport

01:24.125 --> 01:25.919
taken by anyone in the company,

01:26.586 --> 01:29.839
which means whichever filthy traitor baby
visited Puppy Co,

01:30.173 --> 01:32.091
the Chewpie Tracker knows.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.219

for church slacks,

What if I miss an important cartoon
and they ask me about it at school,

03:22.869 --> 03:24.704
but I don't know,
so I don't get into college,

03:24.787 --> 03:26.873

Back in the car!

11:18.511 --> 11:21.847
I'm buying potato chips.
Why do I have to show ID?

11:22.056 --> 11:24.016
It makes me feel powerful.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.645
Dad, come on, let's go.
Oh, we bought snacks.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.066
[snoring]

11:34.902 --> 11:36.070
[engine revving]

11:38.030 --> 11:40.741
No one escapes me forever, Boss Baby.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.828
Isn't that right, Mr. Fruit Pie?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.372
No!

11:46.455 --> 11:50.251
[chomping, chuckles] Mmm-mmm-mmm.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.964
Hello, evidence!

11:55.297 --> 11:57.007
Let's go clear the boss's name!

12:01.345 --> 12:03.514
All clear. [crunches]

12:04.473 --> 12:07.977
Okay, first stop, slightly delayed,
church slacks!

12:10.229 --> 12:13.232
Umm... After I just ate all those snacks?

12:13.315 --> 12:15.443
They'll be the wrong size if we shop now.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.821
You want me to walk around church
with slacks falling to my ankles

12:18.904 --> 12:20.906
like some kind of holy circus clown?

12:22.116 --> 12:25.828
[sighs] I suppose we could drop off
our water and power bill first.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.544
[Baby Simmons mutters] Interesting.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.046
You found someone else's fingerprints
on there?

12:36.130 --> 12:40.050
Hmm? Oh, no. Just Boss Baby's.
Nobody tampered with his chewpie.

12:40.134 --> 12:44.013
-Then why did you say "interesting"?
-I just like my work! [chuckles]

12:44.346 --> 12:47.725
Enjoyable! [humming]

12:49.768 --> 12:52.188
Darn it! Come on, think, you guys!

13:01.822 --> 13:04.533

Staci, forget looking
for evidence I'm innocent.

Probably gonna take a while.

so he won't be bored while we shop.

Looks like Junior Fancy's
is our next closest stop.

Doesn't the bank close early on Saturdays?

that our house is on fire.

Anyway, hope you guys remembered
to turn off the coffee pot.

16:18.727 --> 16:22.356
Just to confirm. You wanted me
to wear  no  underwear, right?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.151
I have to pee again.

-Oh!

How'd you like to be, too?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.908
No, thank you.
Everything here looks like poop.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.160

17:16.410 --> 17:19.246
We're here for new church slacks.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.791
Right on. Gotta look fly for the Sky Guy.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.628
My man, hope that church has room
for one dapper devil.

17:27.004 --> 17:30.090
Gonna need your savvy eye
for fashion here, too, Daddy-O.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.551
[chuckles] Well, if you really need me.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.314
I just want to talk, Boss Baby.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.649
We can still end this business peacefully.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.861

18:14.718 --> 18:17.888
We can try a bigger pair. Just hold still!

has to start from within.

and my butt is going to die!

up there.

You should probably jump to safety
into my arms.

Come on, jumpy-jump!

19:07.354 --> 19:10.482

Why don't you trust me?

After our happy fun doughnut time
at the power plant.

before you trapped me

19:35.924 --> 19:37.968

could handle
the most stressful circumstances.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.893
To be clear,

21:09.977 --> 21:12.854
you did just say "top candidate for CEO"?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.898
Yes. You passed.

Uh, ma'am, I'm pretty sure all he did
was run away all day.

to prove his innocence?
