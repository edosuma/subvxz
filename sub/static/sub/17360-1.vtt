WEBVTT

00:28.612 --> 00:30.530
Yes, I was awake.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.157
I've been awake.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.492
<i>Where are you?
It's time.</i>

00:34.493 --> 00:36.411
I'm...

00:36.412 --> 00:39.247
I'm on my way, is where I am,

00:39.248 --> 00:40.582
and almost there already,

00:40.583 --> 00:42.126
so everything's great.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.072
<i>Good morning, Buttercup!</i>

01:57.701 --> 02:01.204
Where is my money?

02:01.205 --> 02:02.872
Dorian!

02:02.873 --> 02:05.500
Dorian! Dorian, stop! Stop!

02:05.501 --> 02:07.001
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

02:07.002 --> 02:08.586
Stop!

02:08.587 --> 02:09.879
Where's my money!

02:09.880 --> 02:11.381
I gave you your money, Dorian.

02:11.382 --> 02:12.507
Where's the goddamn rent?

02:12.508 --> 02:13.967
I paid you the rent,
I paid you yesterday!

02:13.968 --> 02:15.885
Don't tell me
what you did or didn't do!

02:15.886 --> 02:17.720
You don't know
what happened yesterday,

02:17.721 --> 02:19.722
- You're not a historian!
- I'm just-- Okay--

02:19.723 --> 02:21.015
Are you a historian?

02:21.016 --> 02:22.225
- No, but--
- No!

02:22.226 --> 02:24.394
I want my money today!

02:24.395 --> 02:25.520
600 bucks, or I swear to God,
I will kill you.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.730
If you screw with me again...

02:28.691 --> 02:30.150
Damn it.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.651
What are you gonna do,
you gonna call the cops?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.069
Go ahead.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.779
No, you won't.
You know why?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.240
'Cause I got you,

02:36.782 --> 02:38.242
I. Got. You.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.373
<i>Money!</i>

02:45.374 --> 02:46.916
<i>I want my money!</i>

02:46.917 --> 02:49.253
<i>Today!
My 600 bucks!</i>

03:11.483 --> 03:14.194
<i>The Spring family
is notoriously reclusive</i>

03:14.195 --> 03:17.488
<i>and cannot be reached
for comment at this time.</i>

03:17.489 --> 03:19.866
<i>If you or anyone you know
has information</i>

03:19.867 --> 03:21.826
<i>on the whereabouts
of Lydia Spring,</i>

03:21.827 --> 03:23.996
<i>please contact the number below.</i>

03:38.969 --> 03:40.094
<i>Where's the goddamn rent?</i>

03:40.095 --> 03:42.347
<i>My 600 bucks!</i>

03:42.348 --> 03:44.390
<i>I swear to God,
I will kill you!</i>

03:44.391 --> 03:45.559
<i>Where's my money?</i>

03:47.061 --> 03:48.686
Oh, Mr. Palacios--

03:48.687 --> 03:49.646
Todd, perfect,

03:49.647 --> 03:51.814
I need you
to get up to 745--

03:51.815 --> 03:52.982
Yes, I will, I just--

03:52.983 --> 03:53.983
Welcome to
the Perriman Grand.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.235
Allow us to help you
with that.

03:55.819 --> 03:59.072
I was wondering if I could
get my check a little early this month?

03:59.073 --> 04:00.990
What? Why?
Are you okay?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.992
Yeah, I could just...
use the money.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.827
Look, Todd, I need you
to get up to 745 right away.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.579
There's some kind of
a drunk woman up there acting crazy,

04:06.580 --> 04:07.914
and do me a favor,

04:07.915 --> 04:09.207
check out the penthouse.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.960
They've had a "Do Not Disturb"
since 2:00 p.m. yesterday.

04:11.961 --> 04:13.628
You still have your master key?

04:13.629 --> 04:14.796
No, I-I misplaced it.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.173
Take mine.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.008
745, and then the penthouse.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.510
Okay, but then we can
talk about the check?

04:20.511 --> 04:21.844
Later, yes.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.304
Later, hmm?

04:23.305 --> 04:24.223
Okay.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.392
<i>...Yeah, well,
I'm here on assignment,</i>

04:27.393 --> 04:28.518
so just--

04:28.519 --> 04:29.686
No, I was just--

04:29.687 --> 04:30.937
Get out of the way.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.368
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.750
Oh.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.128
Do I have to leave?

04:55.546 --> 04:57.297
Or could I just sit here
for a second?

04:57.298 --> 04:59.090
Take your time.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.091
<i>Can you just</i>

05:00.092 --> 05:03.594
hang out...with me?

05:03.595 --> 05:04.888
For a second?

05:21.780 --> 05:23.115
I hate men.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.450
I'll be out of here
in an hour.

05:25.451 --> 05:26.576
Okay.

05:26.577 --> 05:27.494
If you need anything,
my name is--

05:29.455 --> 05:30.747
Todd.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.591
<i>I hate voicemail!</i>

05:41.592 --> 05:43.509
Hey, sis, it's me.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.219
Listen, I'm not ignoring you,

05:45.220 --> 05:46.888
I just...

05:46.889 --> 05:48.473
I don't know if I have
the money right now,

05:48.474 --> 05:51.184
and I know I promised you,
but there have been some...

05:51.185 --> 05:52.727
unforeseen circumstances.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.729
I'm gonna get past it,
and I'm gonna get you the money,

05:54.730 --> 05:56.272
and you'll be able to--

05:56.273 --> 05:57.440
Time machine!

05:57.441 --> 05:58.274
No, you lied to me.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.485
<i>You lied to me the whole time,
and now you've screwed both of us.</i>

06:00.486 --> 06:01.611
No! Silence! No!

06:01.612 --> 06:02.278
No, you shut up!

06:02.279 --> 06:04.364
Don't you say a word.
I don't want to hear--

06:04.365 --> 06:06.784
Holy shit, this is when it happened.
That means...

06:13.540 --> 06:14.416
Come on!

06:20.714 --> 06:21.756
<i>Todd?</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:26.219
<i>Where the hell are you, Todd?</i>

06:26.220 --> 06:28.930
I... I don't know.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.890
<i>Have you checked out
the penthouse?</i>

06:30.891 --> 06:32.975
I mean, I'm...
I'm on my way.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.686
I'm on my way.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.003
Estevez.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.087
Zimmerfield.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.297
Missing persons.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.756
Missing persons?

07:45.757 --> 07:48.426
This is a homicide, or...

07:48.427 --> 07:49.510
something.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.220
Yeah, we believe

07:51.221 --> 07:52.430
this homicide has possible
ties to an ongoing--

07:52.431 --> 07:53.431
Probable.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.099
Probable ties to an ongoing
missing persons case--

07:55.100 --> 07:56.684
Wait.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.061
What do you mean
"or something?"

08:05.611 --> 08:08.530
It is strange in here.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.993
What are those,
are those burns?

08:16.455 --> 08:19.457
Homicide said the guy in the bed
was torn in half.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.585
The other guy
had his arm torn off.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.962
There are bite marks
on the ceiling.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.631
<i>So, what are looking for,</i>

08:26.632 --> 08:29.258
like...
an animal, or a weapon?

08:29.259 --> 08:31.427
There are multiple bite marks
on the ceiling.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.513
They say the noise only
went on for 10 or so seconds.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.140
Zim, what the hell
does this in 10 seconds?

08:36.141 --> 08:38.392
A man was bitten in half.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.062
Bitten in half?

08:43.106 --> 08:44.649
They say they got a witness.

08:44.650 --> 08:45.442
Oh, yeah?

08:47.236 --> 08:49.278
How big are his teeth?

08:49.279 --> 08:51.781
And you have no idea
when the key left your possession?

08:51.782 --> 08:52.698
No.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.867
I'll be honest,
it doesn't look great, Todd.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.662
Late to work,
late getting to the penthouse, no key.

08:57.663 --> 08:58.996
It all seems very, you know...

08:58.997 --> 09:01.999
- Confluent.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

09:02.000 --> 09:05.545
Like a lot of little pieces adding up
to me raising my eyebrows like...

09:05.546 --> 09:07.338
<i>Like that.</i>

09:07.339 --> 09:10.091
See, I can't do it.
Only Zimmerfield can.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.468
Only Zimmerfield.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.347
Security tapes are badly scrambled
due to power fluctuations,

09:16.348 --> 09:17.975
but we did manage
to pull this.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.896
<i>This is from under two minutes
before you arrived in the penthouse.</i>

09:24.773 --> 09:26.482
<i>Is that your key?</i>

09:26.483 --> 09:27.733
I don't think so.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.069
Wait, is he wearing
a gorilla mask?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.363
You didn't...

09:32.364 --> 09:34.616
see anything weird this morning,
did you, Mr. Brotzman?

09:36.118 --> 09:37.493
Yes.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.745
No.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.832
M-Maybe.
I don't know.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.960
Are you aware you just gave
every possible response to that question?

09:45.961 --> 09:46.878
Eyebrows.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.841
If I were you,
I wouldn't leave town.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.009
Hmm?

09:53.010 --> 09:54.261
Is there...

09:57.514 --> 10:00.308
Is there any way you could
get the security footage

10:00.309 --> 10:01.393
for the 18th floor?

10:05.731 --> 10:08.858
See, I told you that the
security footage was badly scrambled.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.569
Any particular reason
you want that, Todd?

10:11.570 --> 10:13.988
Did something happen
on the 18th floor?

10:13.989 --> 10:15.324
No, I...

10:17.492 --> 10:18.909
Okay, no.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.871
You didn't touch anything
at the scene,

10:21.872 --> 10:23.039
did you, Todd?

10:23.040 --> 10:24.916
No.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.420
Don't leave town.

10:29.630 --> 10:30.921
I won't.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.465
Seriously.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.217
Don't leave town.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.013
Okay.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.688
Todd!

10:47.689 --> 10:49.607
Hey, man, snap out of it.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.858
Yeah, sorry, what?

10:50.859 --> 10:54.945
I said they think it's connected
to something bigger.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.572
What, like the mob?

10:56.573 --> 10:57.574
No.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.993
While you were in there,

11:00.994 --> 11:02.244
did you see any kind
of an animal?

11:02.245 --> 11:03.454
Animal?

11:03.455 --> 11:04.664
No, I...

11:04.665 --> 11:05.915
They said they found paw prints.

11:05.916 --> 11:09.127
Paw prints?
Like a dog?

11:09.920 --> 11:10.796
No.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.589
Also, you're fired.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.216
Your involvement in all of this,

11:15.217 --> 11:16.342
it's complicated.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.426
You can't fire me.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.844
I just opened a door.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.262
Well, some doors
shouldn't be opened.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.264
Okay, okay, okay,
is there any way, please,

11:22.265 --> 11:24.392
is there any way you can
give me my final check today,

11:24.393 --> 11:25.893
as a type of severance?

11:25.894 --> 11:28.437
Well, it's a same-day termination,
I'd have to delay the check.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.272
What do you mean same day?
It just happened today.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.899
Yes, today is the day
that is the same,

11:31.900 --> 11:33.192
today is the day
that it happened.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.694
Right, but any day that
it would've happened

11:34.695 --> 11:35.820
would've been
the day it happened--

11:35.821 --> 11:37.279
Listen, I need the money.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.115
Yes, but it's
a same-day termination.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.783
It's always a day, right?

11:40.784 --> 11:41.951
Things happen
when they happen.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.328
They happen immediately,
that's what "happening" is, it means--

11:44.329 --> 11:47.082
No, Todd, sometimes when things happen,
they don't happen.

12:42.888 --> 12:43.555
Hi!

12:45.515 --> 12:46.516
Ah!

12:56.735 --> 12:58.277
Ow!

12:58.278 --> 12:59.488
<i>Now you're gonna get...</i>

13:00.322 --> 13:01.490
Hi-ya!

13:06.953 --> 13:08.037
Whoa!

13:09.122 --> 13:10.665
Stop it--
Jesus! With the--

13:12.584 --> 13:14.043
What the hell, man!

13:14.044 --> 13:15.044
You "What the hell?"

13:15.045 --> 13:16.545
No! Me "What the hell?"

13:16.546 --> 13:17.588
How did you get in here?

13:17.589 --> 13:19.381
The window, obviously.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.008
Do you attack everyone
who comes in here.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.968
<i>Seems like a weird thing to do,
but live and let live--</i>

13:22.969 --> 13:24.345
You can't just break into
my apartment!

13:24.346 --> 13:25.429
Clearly, I can. I just did--

13:25.430 --> 13:26.223
I'll call the police.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.057
Hey!

13:28.058 --> 13:29.433
I'm trying to decide
whether you're a clue,

13:29.434 --> 13:30.434
an accomplice,

13:30.435 --> 13:32.770
or an assistant.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.563
Who are you?
What is this?

13:34.564 --> 13:36.440
Have you noticed
an acceleration of strangeness

13:36.441 --> 13:38.192
in your life as of late?

13:38.193 --> 13:40.528
Perhaps a series of intense
or extraordinary events,

13:40.529 --> 13:42.279
which, as of now,
seem unconnected,

13:42.280 --> 13:44.615
with the exception of each
being separately bizarre?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.826
Perhaps every day before now

13:46.827 --> 13:49.537
has, for the most part,
been humdrum and inane,

13:49.538 --> 13:53.040
your life a mundane,
unvarying slog through unfulfilling jobs,

13:53.041 --> 13:55.334
shallow depression,
and boring, boring sex?

13:55.335 --> 13:56.293
Well--

13:56.294 --> 13:57.461
And then suddenly, today,

13:57.462 --> 13:59.713
everything changed,

13:59.714 --> 14:02.551
and your life became a swirl
of interesting activity?

14:05.053 --> 14:05.970
An assistant.

14:05.971 --> 14:06.596
I knew it.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.349
Oh, my name is Dirk Gently.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.600
I'm a detective,

14:11.601 --> 14:12.935
I live here now, and...

14:12.936 --> 14:14.645
Ooh.

14:14.646 --> 14:15.397
I'll be sleeping here tonight.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.658
<i>You're a terrible assistant.</i>

14:31.288 --> 14:33.874
"Project Icarus"
is leaving the building.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.375
What about the other guy?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.585
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

14:37.586 --> 14:39.837
- What?
- What?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.922
It's hard to hear you
through the comm in my ear.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.259
I'm not talking to you through the comm.
I'm talking right to you.

14:45.635 --> 14:46.635
I've got a shot.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.887
What do you mean,
you've got a shot?

14:47.888 --> 14:49.096
Do I take the shot?

14:49.097 --> 14:50.848
Don't take the shot--

14:50.849 --> 14:52.099
Confirmed, taking the shot.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.273
What the hell are you doing?

14:59.274 --> 15:02.444
You are endangering
the whole goddamn operation!

15:28.345 --> 15:29.971
Shit.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.608
What the hell
just happened?

15:43.318 --> 15:44.653
Who were those guys?

15:45.570 --> 15:47.613
Plates came up military.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.282
Is the guy we're tailing...

15:50.283 --> 15:52.701
meeting up with another guy,
who is also being tailed,

15:52.702 --> 15:54.287
by... other people?

16:14.015 --> 16:15.141
I let everyone down.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.353
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

16:20.855 --> 16:21.897
<i>I'm so bored.</i>

16:21.898 --> 16:23.941
My life sucks.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.485
Is it bad, or...

16:26.486 --> 16:28.696
<i>No, I mean, it was
a little better today.</i>

16:28.697 --> 16:30.906
Maybe it'll keep getting better.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.866
Didn't you say that
it started out feeling better

16:32.867 --> 16:34.868
a little bit at a time
when it happened to you?

16:34.869 --> 16:37.579
Y-yeah, a little bit,
but--

16:37.580 --> 16:41.250
Don't worry.
I'm not getting my hopes up.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.793
Remember when we were little,

16:42.794 --> 16:45.714
when Aunt Esther would have
good days and bad days?

16:47.716 --> 16:50.426
Yeah, I just remember
the bad days.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.593
Hey,

16:51.594 --> 16:52.928
<i>I'm coming up tomorrow.</i>

16:52.929 --> 16:54.388
Your message said
you didn't have the money.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.432
Yeah, well...

16:56.433 --> 16:58.517
I'll figure something out, okay?

16:58.518 --> 16:59.601
I'll figure it out.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.895
You seem stressed out.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.481
Is everything okay over there?

17:06.818 --> 17:07.610
Money!

17:07.986 --> 17:09.319
- Don't leave town.
- Also, you're fired.

17:09.320 --> 17:09.863
Hi-ya!

17:11.865 --> 17:13.615
No, I...

17:13.616 --> 17:15.035
everything's fine.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.350
Hurry up!

17:40.351 --> 17:43.645
I'm going
as fast as I can, okay!

17:43.646 --> 17:45.564
Look, it's not easy
doing this under pressure.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.318
Plus, I've never worked with
this kind of rigging before!

17:49.319 --> 17:51.196
It's not like you're paying me
that much anyway.

18:23.978 --> 18:24.979
This is private property.

18:47.669 --> 18:48.670
No, no, no!

18:51.756 --> 18:54.258
No! Stay away!

18:54.259 --> 18:55.384
No!

18:55.385 --> 18:57.094
Somebody!

18:57.095 --> 18:58.387
Help me!

18:58.388 --> 19:00.056
Please!

19:08.648 --> 19:09.648
Oh, God!

19:09.649 --> 19:10.733
No!

19:24.747 --> 19:27.124
Please...

19:27.125 --> 19:30.086
Dirk Gently,
you are a dead man!

19:32.797 --> 19:34.340
Who's...
Who's Dirk Gently?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.218
You're not Dirk Gently?

19:38.219 --> 19:39.971
No.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.267
What, are you kidding me
right now?

19:45.268 --> 19:46.602
Then why did you run?

19:46.603 --> 19:48.645
You have a machete!

19:48.646 --> 19:49.938
And you killed Red!

19:49.939 --> 19:52.065
Why didn't you just say
"I'm not Dirk Gently?"

19:52.066 --> 19:54.067
Because I don't know
who that is!

19:54.068 --> 19:54.944
Hi!

19:57.739 --> 19:58.822
What are you still doing here?

19:58.823 --> 19:59.615
What are you doing here?

19:59.616 --> 20:01.116
I live here.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.284
Right, but
where are you going?

20:02.285 --> 20:03.744
Didn't you say
you lost your job?

20:03.745 --> 20:05.704
No, I didn't say that,
actually.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.039
How did you--

20:07.040 --> 20:08.290
I'm a detective.
I'm on a case.

20:08.291 --> 20:11.585
You worked at that hotel,
where the murders took place.

20:11.586 --> 20:12.836
Been all over the news,

20:12.837 --> 20:14.796
for people who still
watch the news,

20:14.797 --> 20:16.089
you know, old people,
and me, occasionally.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.216
Was I on TV?

20:17.217 --> 20:18.300
Would it be bad for you
if you were?

20:18.301 --> 20:19.718
None of your business.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.969
- Maybe it is though.
- No, it isn't.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.804
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.306
You don't even
know my business!

20:24.307 --> 20:25.641
Maybe I'm a cab driver.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.559
You just said
you were on a case.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.103
Maybe I have two jobs!

20:30.396 --> 20:31.605
Leave me alone.

20:31.606 --> 20:32.314
- But maybe--
- No!

20:32.315 --> 20:33.690
Where?

20:33.691 --> 20:36.109
My sister's house, okay?

20:36.110 --> 20:37.611
<i>I'll give you a ride.</i>

20:37.612 --> 20:39.446
What's your alternative?

20:39.447 --> 20:40.822
Unless you have some kind of
magic car-fixing robot.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.491
<i>You don't, though.</i>

20:42.492 --> 20:44.077
<i>I've seen
in your apartment.</i>

20:45.828 --> 20:47.955
It's an hour away.

20:47.956 --> 20:50.207
Time, I laugh at the concept.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.042
I can spend a whole day
without even trying.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.001
Hey!

20:53.002 --> 20:54.419
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.879
Let's go--

20:55.880 --> 20:56.838
- Let's go.
<i>- Where's my money, huh?</i>

20:56.839 --> 20:58.548
Where's my rent?

20:58.549 --> 20:59.967
<i>Where's my rent money?</i>

20:59.968 --> 21:01.343
Careful, it's not my car.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.136
I paid you, Dorian!

21:03.137 --> 21:04.846
You paid me? Do I look like
an accountant to you?

21:04.847 --> 21:06.265
Do I look like I know
how much you paid me?

21:06.266 --> 21:07.266
Shit. Go, go, go!

21:07.267 --> 21:08.350
Dirk!

21:08.351 --> 21:09.811
Make sure he comes back
with my money!

21:11.437 --> 21:12.272
What the--

21:23.449 --> 21:25.701
They're going to bounce
this case to Major Crimes

21:25.702 --> 21:26.994
unless we can
turn up something

21:26.995 --> 21:29.746
to connect this to Lydia Spring,
and I mean soon.

21:29.747 --> 21:30.580
Anybody find that kitten?

21:30.581 --> 21:31.373
With the bloody--

21:31.374 --> 21:32.499
Yeah.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.918
No, but uniforms found
a hole in a wall

21:34.919 --> 21:37.754
in a stairwell adjacent
to the penthouse.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.881
Went straight through
to the electrical system,

21:39.882 --> 21:41.466
some kind of pulse
blew up the whole deal.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.342
What could've caused that?

21:42.343 --> 21:43.385
Lightning strike.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.845
Did that happen?

21:44.846 --> 21:46.179
Nope. We even checked
the lightning rods.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.681
They still have lightning rods?

21:47.682 --> 21:49.016
As long as
they have lightning.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.268
Where was the security, Zim?

21:52.270 --> 21:54.187
Patrick Spring always
rolled with bodyguards.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.772
We should talk to
Farah Black again.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.941
We've got her on file from when
Lydia first went missing, right here.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.694
Already tried.
No answer.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.405
This is connected to Lydia.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.073
It has to be, right?

22:05.074 --> 22:07.117
Rich girl gets in a fight
with her father, goes missing,

22:07.118 --> 22:08.618
less than one week later,
he's dead?

22:08.619 --> 22:10.579
Could be a coincidence.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.581
That would be ridiculous.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.291
Like bite marks on the ceiling?

22:14.292 --> 22:17.127
Like bite marks
on the ceiling.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.920
What do you got there?

22:18.921 --> 22:21.590
I've been trying to find
Monkey Mask on the tapes,

22:21.591 --> 22:23.008
see if we can trace
his progress to the room,

22:23.009 --> 22:24.259
but it seems like he knew
where the cameras were.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.428
Or he was already
staying in the hotel.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.889
I did find one thing
kind of interesting, though.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.022
Whose dog is that?

22:51.037 --> 22:52.621
Come on, relax,
enjoy the ride.

22:52.622 --> 22:54.581
I think we'll be
great friends.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.541
I can already tell
we've got oodles in common.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.251
We both like, um, eating,

22:58.252 --> 22:59.378
breathing.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.545
We both can walk,

23:00.546 --> 23:02.297
There's an ocean of
commonalities here for us to draw on.

23:03.591 --> 23:04.508
Why does Dorian know your name?

23:08.304 --> 23:10.931
Who?

23:10.932 --> 23:12.265
Oh, right, I was talking
to him this morning.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.558
About what?

23:13.559 --> 23:15.268
Your apartment building,
the Ridgely.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.604
Fascinating history,
that place.

23:18.981 --> 23:19.981
Asshole!

23:23.694 --> 23:26.321
Who are you?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.156
I'm a detective,
a holistic detective,

23:28.157 --> 23:29.908
and before you ask, no,

23:29.909 --> 23:31.076
I'm not with
the CIA anymore.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.828
A holistic...

23:32.829 --> 23:34.329
what is a "holistic detective"?

23:34.330 --> 23:36.748
I'm very glad
you asked me that, Mister...

23:36.749 --> 23:37.541
What's your name?

23:37.542 --> 23:39.209
Todd?

23:39.210 --> 23:41.044
I'm very glad you
asked me that, Todd.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.463
The term "holistic"
refers to my convictions

23:43.464 --> 23:45.966
about the fundamental
interconnectedness of all things.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.759
I do not concern myself

23:47.760 --> 23:50.178
with such petty things
as fingerprint powder,

23:50.179 --> 23:53.306
telltale pieces of pocket fluff
and inane footprints.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.058
You're a detective
who doesn't find clues.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.394
That sounds,
you know, insane.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.104
I see the solution
to each problem

23:59.105 --> 24:02.274
as being detectable in the
pattern and web of the whole.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.192
The connections between
causes and effects

24:04.193 --> 24:05.777
are often much more
subtle and complex

24:05.778 --> 24:07.696
than we, with our rough and
ready understanding of the physical world

24:07.697 --> 24:08.572
might naturally suppose.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.031
Man!

24:11.576 --> 24:12.325
Jesus Christ!

24:12.326 --> 24:13.493
Sorry.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.036
New car.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.913
I thought you said
this wasn't your car.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.749
Doesn't mean it isn't new.

24:32.889 --> 24:35.975
It was good you decided
to come with me.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.563
I didn't decide anything.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.357
You said you'd kill me
if I didn't come.

24:44.358 --> 24:45.942
Well...

24:45.943 --> 24:48.529
you decided it would be
better to come with me than die.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.408
That was nice.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.374
We gotta stop for gas.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.921
But... you don't need gas.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.133
Call it a hunch.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.562
Hey, hi ho hey,
get up on the roof.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.648
Get up on the roof where I can
see you till I get back.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.024
The roof?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.984
Won't this look suspicious?

25:27.985 --> 25:29.945
Suspicious?

25:31.614 --> 25:33.282
Ken, you're a riot.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.179
Did you just kill someone?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.138
I'm an assassin.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.974
That's what I do,
I kill people.

25:58.975 --> 26:01.101
You didn't notice?

26:01.102 --> 26:02.686
<i>You were hired
to come here?</i>

26:02.687 --> 26:03.520
No, I'm a holistic assassin.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.064
A what?

26:07.483 --> 26:10.610
A what?

26:10.611 --> 26:13.947
"Holistic" is the fundamental
interconnectedness of all things.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.991
<i>I don't do your whole deal</i>

26:15.992 --> 26:17.742
<i>with sniper rifles, poison,</i>

26:17.743 --> 26:18.994
or getting hired.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.829
I just...

26:20.830 --> 26:23.164
I kill whoever
I feel like killing all day,

26:23.165 --> 26:25.500
and if I killed them,
they were my target.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.752
The connection between
cause and effect

26:27.753 --> 26:29.045
is much more, you know,

26:29.046 --> 26:30.880
subtle

26:30.881 --> 26:33.925
than you would otherwise think.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.177
I mean...

26:36.178 --> 26:38.138
you wouldn't believe it.

26:38.139 --> 26:40.515
Things, they... they double up.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.350
They parallel.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.852
Everything is chaos, but it...

26:43.853 --> 26:46.605
it's synchronized?

26:46.606 --> 26:48.565
It's like there's
always something ready

26:48.566 --> 26:49.858
to mirror itself,

26:49.859 --> 26:52.736
life endlessly turning inward.

26:52.737 --> 26:53.654
<i>Don't get me wrong...</i>

26:55.072 --> 26:57.241
but that just sounds like
a murder spree.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.121
I've never killed
the wrong person.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.666
I have killed
a lot of people, though.

27:08.544 --> 27:09.211
Get in the car.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.256
See?

27:13.257 --> 27:14.424
I didn't even
ask you to do that,

27:14.425 --> 27:16.009
and you're already acting
like an assistant.

27:16.010 --> 27:18.094
I just...

27:18.095 --> 27:19.471
I'm just trying to be helpful.
It's not--

27:19.472 --> 27:20.722
Whatever keeps you sane.

27:20.723 --> 27:21.931
You know,
I've started to think

27:21.932 --> 27:23.892
you're more important
to this case than you realize.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.769
What case?

27:25.770 --> 27:26.728
You broke into my apartment.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.355
Well--

27:28.356 --> 27:30.190
I mean, how do you even
investigate anything

27:30.191 --> 27:31.316
if you don't use
any investigative...stuff?

27:31.317 --> 27:33.109
Interconnectedness!

27:33.110 --> 27:34.444
Coincidence!

27:34.445 --> 27:36.154
And the rarer, sexier coinky-dinks.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.405
Once hired,

27:37.406 --> 27:40.075
I am intrinsically connected
to the specific case.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.035
I then will
eventually solve the mystery

27:42.036 --> 27:43.870
merely by just kind of
doing whatever.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.747
So, then who told you
to break into my apartment?

27:45.748 --> 27:46.581
No one.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.083
I was investigating your building
for other reasons,

27:48.084 --> 27:49.209
which will for now
remain tangential,

27:49.210 --> 27:51.127
and I just had a hunch
you might be important.

27:51.128 --> 27:52.837
And I was right.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.381
While searching your apartment,

27:54.382 --> 27:56.424
I found a very compelling
piece of evidence.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.425
What did you find?

27:57.426 --> 27:58.719
Nothing.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.763
But you just said--

28:01.764 --> 28:03.890
Everything is connected.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.184
Nothing is also connected.

28:08.562 --> 28:09.437
Don't run
any more red lights.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.731
Whatever keeps you sane.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.317
Oh, no.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.652
We should go.

28:16.862 --> 28:17.363
<i>We should go.</i>

28:29.125 --> 28:29.958
Ring the bell.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.793
What the hell?

28:31.794 --> 28:33.002
You said you were going
to stay in the car.

28:33.003 --> 28:33.920
I lied, though.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.088
What?

28:35.089 --> 28:36.506
Did you see how I snuck up?

28:36.507 --> 28:37.882
I was trained as a ninja by the CIA.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.134
What?

28:39.135 --> 28:40.719
Sorry that's a lie, too.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.803
Just go back to the car.

28:42.763 --> 28:43.972
Todd...

28:43.973 --> 28:45.265
You came!

28:45.266 --> 28:46.599
Yeah, of course,
I came.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.851
You didn't think I would come? I--

28:47.852 --> 28:48.852
Who's this?

28:48.853 --> 28:50.311
It's, uh...

28:50.312 --> 28:52.480
it's Dirk Gently.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.315
Dirk-- Okay, hi. Sorry.

28:54.316 --> 28:55.483
I'm Amanda.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.609
- Hi!
- No, don't.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.236
Don't say hello?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.155
Hello, Amanda!

29:00.156 --> 29:02.031
Are you friends?

29:02.032 --> 29:02.991
- No.
- Yes.

29:02.992 --> 29:03.950
- Yes.
- No.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.076
- No.
- Yes.

29:05.077 --> 29:05.910
- Yes.
- No.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.162
We're very good friends.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.956
Ow!

29:09.832 --> 29:10.750
You're a terrible assis-friend.

29:15.629 --> 29:16.671
<i>...Seattle police have ruled</i>

29:16.672 --> 29:20.133
<i>the death of billionaire entrepreneur
Patrick Spring and several others</i>

29:20.134 --> 29:21.885
<i>an animal attack</i>

29:21.886 --> 29:25.013
<i>rather than a murder
as was initially reported,</i>

29:25.014 --> 29:26.514
<i>though the nature
of the animal</i>

29:26.515 --> 29:27.056
<i>remains undisclosed
at this time.</i>

29:28.225 --> 29:29.934
<i>Sources within
the police department</i>

29:29.935 --> 29:31.227
<i>will neither confirm nor deny--</i>

29:31.228 --> 29:32.562
Mm-hmm!

29:32.563 --> 29:34.606
<i>--whether the tragic incident
bears any connection</i>

29:34.607 --> 29:36.649
<i>to the recent disappearance
of Spring's daughter,</i>

29:36.650 --> 29:38.359
<i>heiress Lydia Spring,</i>

29:38.360 --> 29:40.361
<i>now missing for
over four days--</i>

29:40.362 --> 29:41.905
Do you have any friends
who can come by

29:41.906 --> 29:42.864
and help you with this,

29:42.865 --> 29:44.491
cleaning up, or-

29:44.492 --> 29:47.035
It's hard to keep friends
when you can't go outside

29:47.036 --> 29:49.371
without worrying a gust of wind
will knock you down.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.165
<i>I barely get out
of the house anymore.</i>

29:52.166 --> 29:53.542
God.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.503
Why don't you move back in
with mom and dad?

29:56.504 --> 29:57.879
Maybe they can help you.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.964
You know that
they're broke, Todd.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.758
I would just be
a burden on them.

30:01.759 --> 30:03.510
I'm a burden on everyone.

30:03.511 --> 30:05.304
What's wrong with you, exactly?

30:06.847 --> 30:08.807
I have Pararibulitus.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.725
Ah, of course.

30:10.726 --> 30:11.726
What's that?

30:11.727 --> 30:12.811
Who are you?

30:12.812 --> 30:13.561
I'm Dirk Gently.

30:13.562 --> 30:14.855
I'm a private detective.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.441
You don't look like
a private detective.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.443
Well, no private detective
looks like a private detective.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.529
That's one of the first rules
of private detection.

30:22.530 --> 30:25.323
But if no private detective
looks like a private detective,

30:25.324 --> 30:28.619
how does a private detective
know what it is that he shouldn't look like?

30:32.081 --> 30:33.289
It's a nerve disease.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.292
<i>It causes your brain
to misinterpret certain inputs,</i>

30:36.293 --> 30:39.420
and you actually have
hallucinations that feel real,

30:39.421 --> 30:41.047
and, in most cases,
very painful.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.966
So...

30:42.967 --> 30:44.467
that means...

30:44.468 --> 30:47.220
Water on your hand
could feel like fire.

30:47.221 --> 30:49.097
Your shoe on your foot
could feel like it was crushing it.

30:49.098 --> 30:50.974
Breathing could
feel like drowning.

30:50.975 --> 30:53.142
I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.478
And so interesting.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.438
Yeah, well,

30:57.439 --> 31:00.358
it makes it hard
to not be scared all the time.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.776
<i>But Todd had it,
and he got better,</i>

31:01.777 --> 31:03.319
so...

31:03.320 --> 31:04.863
I just need to take my meds
and eat healthy.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.406
So then why do you stay
in the house?

31:06.407 --> 31:07.699
What?

31:07.700 --> 31:10.451
If the disease is in you,

31:10.452 --> 31:11.953
why does it matter
where you go?

31:11.954 --> 31:13.204
<i>Hey, uh...</i>

31:13.205 --> 31:15.124
Amanda, do you wanna jam?

31:17.751 --> 31:19.628
Yeah. Of course.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.844
Cool.
I'll be there in a minute.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.764
Why are you doing this?

31:31.765 --> 31:33.516
I'm on a case.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.393
My primary method of investigation
is to follow someone

31:35.394 --> 31:36.603
who looks like they know
where they're going--

31:36.604 --> 31:37.854
Is it that important

31:37.855 --> 31:39.647
that you not be identified
as my friend,

31:39.648 --> 31:41.024
that you felt the need
to argue about it?

31:41.025 --> 31:42.650
You are an insane person,

31:42.651 --> 31:43.776
who has insinuated himself
into my life

31:43.777 --> 31:45.111
in a moment of desperation.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.487
Okay, well, I think
you're an insane person,

31:46.488 --> 31:47.906
who has insinuated himself

31:47.907 --> 31:49.365
into being my combination
assistant and best friend.

31:49.366 --> 31:50.992
But that's...

31:50.993 --> 31:53.287
It-it's--
That is not what's happening.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.167
I have the primary
and the secondary in my sights.

32:02.087 --> 32:02.963
Uh-huh.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.591
What?

32:06.592 --> 32:11.012
I thought we were clear
that the rifle isn't necessary.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.765
Yeah, but in
the mishkin parambuler,

32:13.766 --> 32:15.850
it said that
we have to prevent

32:15.851 --> 32:17.352
all aggressive action
against the primary.

32:17.353 --> 32:18.811
The what?

32:18.812 --> 32:20.396
The mission parameters?

32:20.397 --> 32:21.689
Except that's not
what you said.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.192
The gum went weird
in my mouth, sir.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.276
It went weird

32:25.277 --> 32:27.321
and made my tongue
do a weird move and say stuff wrong.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.908
What branch
did they assign you to me from?

32:31.909 --> 32:33.326
<i>Provisional?</i>

32:33.327 --> 32:35.495
They said you didn't have
the budget for the op.

32:35.496 --> 32:37.497
Okay.

32:37.498 --> 32:42.001
Our goal is to observe
and protect the primary.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.003
Not...

32:44.546 --> 32:46.381
to kill anyone.

32:46.382 --> 32:48.257
Right.

32:48.258 --> 32:49.301
Understood.

32:56.892 --> 32:57.935
<i>I've got a shot.</i>

33:06.068 --> 33:06.944
Ah!

33:45.733 --> 33:47.233
It's okay. It's okay.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.901
You okay?
Back off, okay?

33:48.902 --> 33:49.570
Back off!

34:04.293 --> 34:05.753
Thank you.

34:19.892 --> 34:22.394
So, you pay for her medication?

34:24.813 --> 34:25.731
I did.

34:27.191 --> 34:28.483
What's changed?

34:28.484 --> 34:30.902
That was my last $300.

34:30.903 --> 34:33.446
I now literally have no money.

34:33.447 --> 34:34.655
None.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.365
I don't understand.

34:36.366 --> 34:37.450
You've lost your job,

34:37.451 --> 34:39.494
you've got that nut Dorian
chasing you around,

34:39.495 --> 34:41.245
why give her all of your money?

34:41.246 --> 34:41.913
Surely--

34:41.914 --> 34:43.664
A disease
runs in my family,

34:43.665 --> 34:44.957
it has for five generations.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.001
- Pararibulitis?
- Yeah, right.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.544
How did you pay for treatment?
You don't seem...

34:48.545 --> 34:50.630
Our parents.

34:50.631 --> 34:52.090
I was in college.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.175
They had more money
back then.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.635
By the time I'd recovered,

34:55.636 --> 34:58.513
my treatments had pretty much
depleted all their savings.

34:58.514 --> 35:00.973
It's good of you to help.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.184
She's my sister.

35:03.185 --> 35:04.769
Every time I see her,

35:04.770 --> 35:07.855
she looks at me, and thinks...

35:07.856 --> 35:10.359
she thinks maybe
she can get better, too.

35:12.194 --> 35:14.320
Well, isn't there a chance
she will, though?

35:14.321 --> 35:16.072
If you did?

35:16.073 --> 35:17.365
Let's...

35:17.366 --> 35:18.783
Can we just be quiet

35:18.784 --> 35:21.829
for the drive?

35:45.185 --> 35:48.896
Probably should've seen
this one coming.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.482
Like the asteroid
that killed the dinosaurs.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.239
I couldn't have known.
How could I have known?

35:58.240 --> 36:00.742
There's no way
I could have known what...

36:02.619 --> 36:04.079
I'm not--

36:06.915 --> 36:09.333
I'm coming to get you, Lydia.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.211
I am coming to get you, okay!

36:12.212 --> 36:13.881
I'm coming to get you!

36:18.093 --> 36:19.427
What? Why?

36:19.428 --> 36:20.469
No, just leave me alone.

36:20.470 --> 36:21.387
I live here now.

36:21.388 --> 36:22.513
What?

36:22.514 --> 36:24.599
Well, why do you think
I was talking to Dorian.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.766
Did you not hear my voice?

36:25.767 --> 36:27.643
I'm not from here,

36:27.644 --> 36:30.438
I'm from a totally
different place.

36:30.439 --> 36:33.191
England.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.109
Screw this.

36:36.570 --> 36:38.446
<i>Ow! Ah!</i>

36:38.447 --> 36:39.530
Shit, sorry.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.616
Ow! I-- Ah-hah!

36:43.493 --> 36:44.827
Hey!

36:44.828 --> 36:46.078
That's mine!

36:46.079 --> 36:47.788
What do you want now?

36:47.789 --> 36:50.249
I need you to work with me,
I wanted to discuss the case.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.250
What case?

36:51.251 --> 36:52.960
The Death of Patrick Spring.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.545
The incident
at the Perriman Grand?

36:54.546 --> 36:56.505
I was hired to investigate it...

36:56.506 --> 36:57.965
by the victim.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.467
Patrick Spring, the rich guy?

36:59.468 --> 37:01.302
Wait, he's the one
who died at the hotel?

37:01.303 --> 37:02.970
That's right,

37:02.971 --> 37:04.472
and he hired me,
well above my normal rate,

37:04.473 --> 37:06.182
to investigate his own death

37:06.183 --> 37:09.060
a full six weeks
before it even happened.

37:09.061 --> 37:09.727
I wouldn't
have taken the case

37:09.728 --> 37:11.604
except, come on,

37:11.605 --> 37:13.147
animal attack?

37:13.148 --> 37:14.482
Seattle?

37:14.483 --> 37:16.150
A guy predicting his own death?

37:16.151 --> 37:17.610
Pretty interesting stuff.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.987
And how am I involved
in any of this?

37:19.988 --> 37:21.572
You were there,
the day it happened.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.699
<i>They used your key.</i>

37:23.700 --> 37:25.827
The cases are connected.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.455
All cases are connected.

37:29.456 --> 37:31.666
Have you ever actually
solved a case?

37:31.667 --> 37:32.667
Sure. Tons.

37:32.668 --> 37:33.626
Well, some.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.419
Well, a few.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.338
There was a bit about a sofa,
a thing with Thor--

37:37.339 --> 37:38.130
Thor?

37:38.131 --> 37:40.216
Yes, he's not nearly
as good-looking as people say.

37:40.217 --> 37:41.592
It's kind of a funny story--

37:41.593 --> 37:42.802
Listen, Dirk,
you seem like a nice guy.

37:42.803 --> 37:45.721
Or, not nice,
but you seem like a guy, okay?

37:45.722 --> 37:47.765
You seem like a guy,
but I can't do this.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.350
I'm a murder suspect, okay?
I'm broke--

37:49.351 --> 37:50.559
Don't be silly.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.936
Money won't be a problem
for you soon, Todd.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.604
How do you figure that?

37:53.605 --> 37:55.356
Now that I've told you
you're working the case,

37:55.357 --> 37:56.899
you're working the case.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.443
<i>The universe will
make you a part of this</i>

37:59.444 --> 38:01.028
whether you are complicit
or not.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.031
You are now a vital part
of the investigation.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.367
Well, so who's
going to pay me. You?

38:06.368 --> 38:07.868
Probably not.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.662
But you will investigate,

38:09.663 --> 38:11.038
even if you don't mean to,

38:11.039 --> 38:12.915
and you will
be compensated,

38:12.916 --> 38:15.168
even if you haven't
technically earned it.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.877
<i>Oh, no.</i>

38:16.878 --> 38:18.588
<i>Things are about to get ugly.</i>

38:20.257 --> 38:21.717
Stay frosty.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.138
<i>What's this?</i>

38:28.640 --> 38:30.100
"Project Incubus."

38:32.686 --> 38:33.687
Shit!

38:40.152 --> 38:42.320
Ow!

38:42.321 --> 38:43.696
Stupid traitor bed!

38:43.697 --> 38:45.781
Whoo! Whoo!

38:45.782 --> 38:47.074
I'm sick of the games!

38:47.075 --> 38:48.744
No chess, no checkers,
no monopoly!

38:52.497 --> 38:53.581
What is this?

38:53.582 --> 38:54.457
What is happening?

38:54.458 --> 38:55.416
The Rowdy 3!

38:55.417 --> 38:56.792
Let's go!

38:56.793 --> 38:58.085
There are four of them.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.546
I'm wildly aware.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.257
They're after you, right?

39:03.258 --> 39:04.425
Come on, Dirk,
please go!

39:04.426 --> 39:06.385
Please, just go!

39:09.765 --> 39:12.183
Bad news delivery!

39:12.184 --> 39:13.185
Hello!

39:16.104 --> 39:17.772
What the hell is this new shit?

39:17.773 --> 39:19.398
Big D is gonna
take care of business!

39:19.399 --> 39:21.942
Listen, I am a person
of varied intuitions.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.694
I have a lot of feelings
about a lot of things,

39:23.695 --> 39:25.529
and they're rarely wrong,
but also rarely completely right.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.781
That's the nature
of the situation,

39:26.782 --> 39:28.449
that's a reality
we're going to accept.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.034
Accepted? No? Yes?
Doesn't matter.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.286
There's four men
with baseball bats

39:32.287 --> 39:34.955
headed up the stairs right now
to wreck your apartment!

39:34.956 --> 39:36.624
- No, no, no, no!
- No, Todd, no! No. Please--

39:36.625 --> 39:37.875
I don't want to be
a part of this.

39:49.346 --> 39:50.971
Ding dong.

39:57.104 --> 39:59.814
We are not professionals!

39:59.815 --> 40:01.565
Shut your hole!

40:01.566 --> 40:04.486
Before we tear it out your face
and throw it in a dumpster!

40:11.368 --> 40:12.994
Help!

40:19.418 --> 40:20.251
TV out!

40:20.252 --> 40:22.586
There's garbage everywhere!
What the--

40:22.587 --> 40:23.963
Television!

40:23.964 --> 40:26.215
I have had enough of this shit.

40:26.216 --> 40:27.883
Jesus, you gotta
be kiddin' me.

40:27.884 --> 40:30.136
We got eyes on a gun,
require backup at 515--

40:30.137 --> 40:31.512
"Request" backup.

40:31.513 --> 40:32.805
Request backup
at 515 Ridgely Lane.

40:32.806 --> 40:34.265
Dorian's gonna kick your ass!

40:34.266 --> 40:36.392
Shit, Alpha is in danger.

40:36.393 --> 40:37.643
We're live.

40:37.644 --> 40:38.686
Lock and load.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.105
Okay. Lockers.

41:34.367 --> 41:35.410
No.

41:40.248 --> 41:42.583
Everything I own...

41:44.002 --> 41:45.711
No...

41:45.712 --> 41:47.130
Why?

41:50.008 --> 41:52.051
What did they do to you?

41:52.052 --> 41:53.220
It's complicated--

41:54.387 --> 41:55.722
Where's my rent, Todd?

42:00.894 --> 42:03.145
What did you guys
do to this place?

42:03.146 --> 42:04.730
Who were those guys?

42:04.731 --> 42:06.649
You think they intimidate me?

42:06.650 --> 42:07.858
Dorian, just listen, I--

42:07.859 --> 42:09.610
No, it's too late,
nobody makes a fool out of me!

42:09.611 --> 42:11.278
What, you think I'm stupid?

42:11.279 --> 42:13.072
Tell me you have
some kind of way out of this.

42:13.073 --> 42:14.323
I'm very good
at getting in to situations.

42:14.324 --> 42:15.699
I've often found I have more
trouble getting out--

42:15.700 --> 42:17.576
Dirk, shut up!

42:17.577 --> 42:18.495
Just shut up!

42:20.705 --> 42:22.122
I know what you did.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.374
I warned you!

42:23.375 --> 42:24.458
Bye-bye, you thieving mother--

42:32.092 --> 42:34.093
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Let's go! Let's go!

42:34.094 --> 42:35.053
Move out!

42:41.351 --> 42:42.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Freeze! Freeze!

42:46.147 --> 42:47.064
- Drop the gun!
- No, you drop the gun!

42:47.065 --> 42:49.149
- Freeze!
- Drop it! Drop it!

42:49.150 --> 42:50.651
- FBI!
- Drop your weapons!

42:50.652 --> 42:51.569
- Drop it!
- Freeze!

42:51.570 --> 42:53.487
What is going on?

43:46.708 --> 43:48.375
Find me!

43:48.376 --> 43:50.878
Find me!

43:50.879 --> 43:52.547
I'm right here!

44:10.982 --> 44:12.400
What now?

44:19.866 --> 44:21.742
You're free to go.

44:21.743 --> 44:22.910
For now.

44:22.911 --> 44:24.787
Really?

44:24.788 --> 44:26.997
Scene techs are saying
the death looks like an accident.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.123
For now.

44:28.124 --> 44:31.586
Good news is FBI had
surveillance on Dorian Ozman's house.

44:32.796 --> 44:33.921
They did?

44:33.922 --> 44:36.757
Uh... why?

44:36.758 --> 44:38.967
Apparently, he sold a really
incredible amount of drugs

44:38.968 --> 44:40.636
to an astonishing
number of people.

44:40.637 --> 44:44.431
So, I'm not a suspect
in anything?

44:44.432 --> 44:45.891
You're a person of interest,

44:45.892 --> 44:48.477
permanently,

44:48.478 --> 44:50.104
even though
you're not necessarily

44:50.105 --> 44:51.355
an interesting person.

44:51.356 --> 44:54.316
That feels unnecessarily rude.

44:54.317 --> 44:57.903
The police will determine
the proper levels of antagonism

44:57.904 --> 45:00.072
toward a man now connected

45:00.073 --> 45:03.283
to four dead bodies

45:03.284 --> 45:06.036
in two separate cases.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.163
The "do not leave town" order
is still in effect.

45:08.164 --> 45:09.249
Do not leave town.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.472
Hey, you're not
supposed to be down here.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.312
Hermano Palacios?

45:32.313 --> 45:35.232
Um... yes?

45:35.233 --> 45:37.651
Did you find a kitten?

45:37.652 --> 45:38.736
What?

45:38.737 --> 45:39.820
In the penthouse,

45:39.821 --> 45:41.989
did you find a kitten?

45:41.990 --> 45:43.073
A kitten?

45:43.074 --> 45:44.617
I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:50.373 --> 45:51.833
All done down here, Ed.

45:54.002 --> 45:55.795
You're sure
you did not see a kitten?

46:30.747 --> 46:31.915
Crap.

46:36.878 --> 46:38.212
They let me out, too.

46:38.213 --> 46:40.672
Must've been the CIA,
always getting me out of things.

46:40.673 --> 46:43.550
They didn't even mention
the bloody Rowdy 3,

46:43.551 --> 46:45.219
but I guess the CIA
must've told them not to,

46:45.220 --> 46:45.886
which makes sense--

46:45.887 --> 46:48.055
Shut up.
I don't care. Go away.

46:48.056 --> 46:49.682
Need a ride?

46:51.976 --> 46:53.811
Someone died tonight.

46:53.812 --> 46:55.229
They died right in front of us,

46:55.230 --> 46:56.814
that doesn't bother you?

46:56.815 --> 46:58.398
I think it might
bother me more later,

46:58.399 --> 47:00.359
when I'm less...

47:00.360 --> 47:01.527
something.

47:01.528 --> 47:03.445
Do you want to know why
Dorian wanted the rent?

47:03.446 --> 47:05.197
Because he was crazy.

47:05.198 --> 47:06.240
No, because
I stole it from him.

47:06.241 --> 47:07.699
Huh, but-- What?

47:07.700 --> 47:09.535
I was afraid because I knew
Amanda needed her meds,

47:09.536 --> 47:12.120
and I didn't think I'd be able
to get an advance at the hotel,

47:12.121 --> 47:13.205
so I paid him in cash,

47:13.206 --> 47:14.706
I snuck around
the back of his house

47:14.707 --> 47:17.125
when he wasn't there,
and I stole it back.

47:17.126 --> 47:19.086
I thought he'd be
too cracked out to notice,

47:19.087 --> 47:20.170
he did notice,

47:20.171 --> 47:21.463
and he wouldn't let it go,

47:21.464 --> 47:22.589
and now he's dead.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.258
Well...

47:24.259 --> 47:26.051
to be honest,

47:26.052 --> 47:27.261
that seems practical to me.

47:27.262 --> 47:28.554
Practical?

47:28.555 --> 47:30.597
He shot himself in the head!

47:30.598 --> 47:32.933
B-But you're okay, right?

47:32.934 --> 47:34.518
I have nothing.

47:34.519 --> 47:37.104
I don't have my apartment,

47:37.105 --> 47:38.564
I have zero money,

47:38.565 --> 47:40.065
I have no prospects.

47:40.066 --> 47:41.108
I'm homeless,

47:41.109 --> 47:42.734
and living a lie,

47:42.735 --> 47:44.695
and I'm a suspect
in multiple homicides.

47:44.696 --> 47:46.905
When you put it
like that, it's pretty bad,

47:46.906 --> 47:48.448
but we've got a case to solve.

47:48.449 --> 47:50.742
A missing girl,
her murdered father,

47:50.743 --> 47:52.494
and, undoubtedly, more
pieces falling into place--

47:52.495 --> 47:55.455
I am not your Watson, asshole!

47:55.456 --> 47:57.624
I'm not available
for side-kicking

47:57.625 --> 47:58.959
on something
I am not involved with!

47:58.960 --> 48:01.670
I am my own
messed up person,

48:01.671 --> 48:02.921
with my own
messed up problems!

48:02.922 --> 48:04.381
So just--

48:04.382 --> 48:06.216
No, just shut up.
You never shut up!

48:06.217 --> 48:07.259
Shut up!

48:07.260 --> 48:08.428
Stop!

48:10.096 --> 48:13.390
You've been making choices
out of desperation for too long,

48:13.391 --> 48:15.934
that much is obvious.

48:15.935 --> 48:18.228
You're backing yourself
into a corner.

48:18.229 --> 48:20.772
Break the pattern.

48:20.773 --> 48:23.650
Take control of your life, Todd.

48:23.651 --> 48:29.406
The instant you take control,
interesting things will happen.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.451
I guarantee it.

48:35.747 --> 48:37.205
No.

48:37.206 --> 48:40.167
You know what, no,
I don't want to hear all that

48:40.168 --> 48:41.919
from you right now.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.087
Keep the Hallmark card.

49:14.911 --> 49:17.330
Stop the bus!

49:19.374 --> 49:20.959
Stop the bus!

49:44.232 --> 49:47.026
I, uh...

49:49.070 --> 49:50.112
Your dog,

49:50.113 --> 49:51.279
I-I brought...

49:51.280 --> 49:52.907
The address was on the tag.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.081
Come here...

50:05.878 --> 50:06.921
Thanks.

50:15.722 --> 50:18.099
Yeah, that's Brotzman.

51:20.828 --> 51:23.622
<i>...And we'll pick another winner tonight.</i>

51:23.623 --> 51:27.167

52:36.904 --> 52:39.447
<i>You are never gonna get</i>

52:39.448 --> 52:42.117
<i>Everything you want
in this world</i>

52:42.118 --> 52:43.535
<i>First things first</i>

52:43.536 --> 52:45.496
<i>Get what you deserve...</i>

52:56.632 --> 53:01.720
<i>It began when I was
21 years old</i>

53:01.721 --> 53:06.933
<i>And my mom and dad
were begging me to go</i>

53:06.934 --> 53:12.147
<i>So I left a note
and we went and hit the road</i>

53:12.148 --> 53:15.943
<i>Me and Chris
and all the stuff I own</i>
