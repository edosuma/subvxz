of the M.O.,

11:26.019 --> 11:27.519

13:11.024 --> 13:12.991
Yeah, I'm great. I'm just
doing some stretching

13:12.993 --> 13:15.793
because it helps me
keep my brain limber.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.695
I've also been doing
some geo-profiling.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.265
The red markers indicate
where the victims lived,

13:20.267 --> 13:21.699
except, of course,
Rudy Hightower, who was homeless.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.135
The blue markers indicate
where they were last seen alive.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.070
And this
is the disposal site.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.272
So that's his hunting zone.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.640
Which means he probably
lives close by.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.842
Ok, so something's
not adding up for me here.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.176
Here you go.
Thanks.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.511
If we are dealing
with a cannibal,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.980
why does he dispose of the bodies?
Why not keep them?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.515
Well, it's not easy
to keep a body fresh.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.150
Maybe he doesn't have
the resources.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.120
Maybe he doesn't require large
portions of flesh to satiate his urges.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.022
Most ritual cannibalism
involves the consumption

13:44.024 --> 13:46.491
of particular organs as a means
to commune with the deceased.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.359
But none of the victims
were missing any organs.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.162
Which means it's probably not about
the ritual but about the compulsion.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.031
I don't know. He grabs them,
he holds them captive,

13:53.033 --> 13:54.699
and then he buries them all
in the exact same spot.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.368
And how do we explain the
first victim, Melvin Lewis?

any human bite marks.

I got the 4-1-1 on our
first victim, Melvin Lewis.

15:50.177 --> 15:52.677
Originally from the Malibu
of the Midwest,

15:52.679 --> 15:54.446
Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

15:54.448 --> 15:56.514
Melvin moved to Milwaukee
12 years ago

15:56.516 --> 15:58.717
when wifey ran away
with his best friend.

15:58.719 --> 15:59.684
Ouch.

15:59.686 --> 16:01.352
Yeah. Luckily
they had no kids.

16:01.354 --> 16:03.321
No criminal record.
Like super squeaky clean.

16:03.323 --> 16:04.556
Not even a parking ticket.

16:04.558 --> 16:06.725
He joined Facebook
a year ago.

16:06.727 --> 16:09.360
He has a whopping 6 friends,
all from work.

16:09.362 --> 16:10.628
He drives a truck,
right?

16:10.630 --> 16:12.530
Yeah. A milk truck,
to be exact.

16:12.532 --> 16:14.265
But only did that for a month.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.568
Before, he worked for 10 years

16:16.570 --> 16:18.236
at an animal control center,

16:18.238 --> 16:20.238
but he was laid off
due to budget cuts.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.073
What exactly
did he do, Garcia?

16:22.075 --> 16:23.374
He was a dogcatcher.

16:23.376 --> 16:25.477
But like a S.W.A.T. team
of dogcatchers.

16:25.479 --> 16:27.145
He specialized in dangerous
and trapped animals,

16:27.147 --> 16:30.215
including but not limited to
skunks, a raccoon,

16:30.217 --> 16:31.716
and one time a giant python.

16:31.718 --> 16:33.251
All right, thanks, babe.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.252
That could be it.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.553
What, the python?

16:35.555 --> 16:36.755
No, bite marks.
Of course.

16:36.757 --> 16:37.989
That could be how
he was doing it.

16:37.991 --> 16:39.157
That's why
it was undetectable.

16:39.159 --> 16:40.492
Brain tissue, we need to
look at brain tissue--

16:40.494 --> 16:41.793
Ok, Reid--
Sorry.

16:41.795 --> 16:43.495
I don't think this
is a biting fetish or cannibalism.

16:43.497 --> 16:45.497
I think it's a virus,
and the biting

16:45.499 --> 16:47.065
is merely a means
of transmission.

16:47.067 --> 16:48.466
What kind of virus?

16:48.468 --> 16:50.301
There are several possibilities.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,

16:50.303 --> 16:52.637
tick-borne encephalitis,
but the most likely culprit is rabies,

16:52.639 --> 16:55.607
and that wouldn't show up
in an autopsy except in brain tissue.

16:55.609 --> 16:58.910
So since Lewis was the only victim
not bitten by a human,

16:58.912 --> 17:01.713
the unsub must have used
an animal to infect him first.

17:01.715 --> 17:04.848
And after that, he somehow facilitated
human to human transmission.

17:04.851 --> 17:06.818
That would explain
the random victimology.

17:06.819 --> 17:08.819
It doesn't matter who he infects.
All he needs is a host.

17:08.821 --> 17:10.288
Which also means
the holding period

17:10.290 --> 17:12.223
isn't about torture,
it's about incubation.

17:12.224 --> 17:14.392
I was attacked
by a rabid fox once.

17:14.394 --> 17:16.361
Shot the thing 3 times
before it went down.

17:16.363 --> 17:18.296
Freakin' terrifying.
It was like a horror movie.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.531
Yikes. We need to have the M.E. test
for rabies vectors

17:20.534 --> 17:21.766
in the brain samples.

17:21.768 --> 17:23.902
And then we need to deliver
the profile.

17:25.805 --> 17:27.472
Based on the demographics
of the area,

17:27.473 --> 17:29.641
we believe that we're
looking for a Caucasian male

17:29.643 --> 17:31.109
in his mid-20s to late 30s.

17:31.111 --> 17:33.478
We just received confirmation
from the coroner's office

17:33.480 --> 17:35.914
that each of the victims
died from rabies.

17:35.916 --> 17:38.183
Two of the victims sustained
significant human bite wounds,

17:38.185 --> 17:41.486
and dental records confirm that those
bite wounds came from other victims.

17:41.488 --> 17:43.154
Which means that
somehow or another,

17:43.156 --> 17:44.956
he's facilitating
biting attacks.

17:44.958 --> 17:47.892
We think he's a sadist
who gets off on watching the attacks.

17:47.894 --> 17:51.429
He may record them so he can
relive the event over and over again.

17:51.431 --> 17:54.432
Rabies has been around since the
 beginning of documented history.

17:54.434 --> 17:57.268
It has the highest case
to mortality rate in existence

17:57.270 --> 17:59.637
and is arguably the deadliest disease
known to man.

17:59.639 --> 18:03.608
It's derived from a sanskrit
word meaning "to do violence."

18:03.610 --> 18:06.477
Carriers literally
go stark raving mad.

18:06.479 --> 18:08.513
Uh, I thought there's
a vaccine for it.

18:08.515 --> 18:11.282
There is, but the post-exposure
prophylaxis is only effective

18:11.284 --> 18:13.451
if administered within
24 hours of infection.

18:13.453 --> 18:17.488
Once the symptoms appear,
the prognosis is death.

[Grunting]

18:18.658 --> 18:20.925
Get off! Get off! Aah!

18:20.927 --> 18:23.895
It's also contagious,
so it's at great risk to himself

18:23.897 --> 18:26.030
that he's chosen
this method to kill.

18:26.032 --> 18:27.765
Which means it holds
special significance to him.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.934
He may have lost a pet
or even a relative to the virus.

18:29.936 --> 18:32.937
It is not easy to obtain a sample
of the virus.

18:32.939 --> 18:35.073
We think he most likely
started with an animal.

18:35.075 --> 18:37.308
So he may have worked
at a veterinary clinic,

18:37.310 --> 18:39.477
maybe a pest control
company.

[Screaming]

18:41.948 --> 18:44.649
Hotch: What he's doing takes
deliberation and patience

18:44.651 --> 18:46.284
and is rooted in
a need-based desire,

18:46.286 --> 18:48.853
so he's not going to stop
on his own.

18:48.855 --> 18:50.355

The only two people reported
missing for the last month

19:07.774 --> 19:09.741
within a 10-mile radius
of the hunting zone.

19:09.743 --> 19:12.744
Pretty good chance the unsub's
holding at least one of them.

19:12.746 --> 19:14.679
So I went through the list

19:14.681 --> 19:16.514
of vet offices and animal
control employees,

19:16.516 --> 19:18.016
and nada.
Everybody's clean.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.717
Guys, I've been doing
some math.

19:19.719 --> 19:21.786
Based on the estimated
time of death

19:21.788 --> 19:24.322
and when the victims were last
seen alive, it appears as though

19:24.324 --> 19:25.790
the first victim,
Melvin Lewis,

19:25.792 --> 19:27.125
was held for
a couple of months.

19:27.127 --> 19:28.993
The second victim,
Rudy Hightower,

19:28.995 --> 19:30.995
for one month,
the third victim,

19:30.997 --> 19:32.797
Susan Clark, for only
a couple of weeks.

19:32.799 --> 19:34.832
So why is he taking progressively
less time with these victims?

19:34.834 --> 19:36.301
He's getting more efficient?

19:36.303 --> 19:37.502
He may have found
a way to shorten

19:37.504 --> 19:38.770
the incubation period.

19:38.772 --> 19:40.238
And how would he do that?

19:40.240 --> 19:41.472
Rabies attacks
the nervous system.

19:41.474 --> 19:42.807
It travels a few
millimeters a day

19:42.809 --> 19:44.208
until it reaches
the brain.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.311
But if you were to infect the area
around the head of the neck,

19:46.313 --> 19:47.578
the distance
would be shortened.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.048
He may be some kind
of symphoraphiliac.

19:50.050 --> 19:52.216
And instead of setting
a fire or causing an accident

19:52.218 --> 19:53.818
and watching
the ensuing mayhem,

19:53.820 --> 19:55.320
he just wants
to watch them die.

19:55.322 --> 19:57.922
A rabies death is apparently
quite the spectacle.

19:57.924 --> 19:59.691
There are convulsions,
spasms,

19:59.693 --> 20:02.660
then the madness sets in,
along with uncontrollable salivation,

20:02.662 --> 20:04.162
which accounts for
the foaming a the mouth

20:04.164 --> 20:05.730
we all associate
with the disease.

20:05.732 --> 20:07.699
That sounds terrible.
It is.

20:07.701 --> 20:09.968
And one of the cruelest ironies of all
is the extreme dehydration

20:09.970 --> 20:11.636
caused by hydrophobia.

20:11.638 --> 20:14.872
Victims have a visceral
fear response to liquid of any sort.

20:14.874 --> 20:16.808
Add to that confusion,
hallucinations,

20:16.810 --> 20:20.044
and you can probably
imagine the horror.

21:38.024 --> 21:39.357
Morgan:
Give it to me, Dollface.

21:39.359 --> 21:42.360
Do you know that over 50,000
people die of rabies every year

21:42.362 --> 21:44.328
in third-world countries?

21:44.330 --> 21:47.165
Thank God for monsieur Pasteur,
otherwise we'd all be dead.

21:47.167 --> 21:50.368
Ok, so I looked into every known case
of rabies exposure

21:50.370 --> 21:52.737
in the country
over the last 20 years.

21:52.739 --> 21:53.704
Did you find anything?

21:53.706 --> 21:54.839
Cool your jets,
hot chocolate.

21:54.841 --> 21:56.307
I will let you know
if I've got something.

21:56.309 --> 21:58.209
So I've got something.
15 years ago,

21:58.211 --> 22:00.044
in a town
called Two Rivers, Wisconsin,

22:00.046 --> 22:01.979
a 9-year-old,
Hunter Cunningham,

22:01.981 --> 22:04.315
was admitted to the hospital
with severe flu-like symptoms.

22:04.317 --> 22:07.485
Symptoms get worse,
he develops hydrophobia.

22:07.487 --> 22:10.655
Turns out that 3 weeks
prior, he was bitten by a bat

22:10.657 --> 22:12.156
when he was out camping
with his family.

22:12.158 --> 22:14.158
Two Rivers is less than
a 2-hour drive from here,

22:14.160 --> 22:15.793
and it's even closer
to the disposal site.

22:15.795 --> 22:17.261
A bat. That's odd.

22:17.263 --> 22:19.897
Actually, bats make up
12% of Wisconsin's mammalian population,

22:19.899 --> 22:22.500
and they're responsible for the
majority of the infections in the U.S.

22:22.502 --> 22:24.535
Baby girl, what's so special about this
Hunter Cunningham kid?

22:24.537 --> 22:25.736
Here's what's special.

22:25.738 --> 22:27.572
A week after he was admitted
to the hospital,

22:27.574 --> 22:28.873
he checked out of the hospital.

22:28.875 --> 22:31.109
But I can't find
a death certificate.

22:31.111 --> 22:32.643
It's like he disappeared.

22:32.645 --> 22:33.678
What about his family?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.513
Uh, his father Patrick
died 6 years ago

22:35.515 --> 22:37.982
of a massive heart attack.
And mom, Wanda,

22:37.984 --> 22:41.052
works as a bartender
at the Tropicana hotel in Vegas.

22:41.054 --> 22:42.120
JJ: Any siblings?

22:42.122 --> 22:43.387
Yes, affirmative.

22:43.389 --> 22:45.723
One older brother,
David Wade Cunningham,

22:45.725 --> 22:47.425
28-year-old resident
of Hawaii.

22:47.427 --> 22:48.426
And what's his deal?

22:48.428 --> 22:50.328
His deal is...

22:50.330 --> 22:51.863
Ay, chihuahua.

22:51.865 --> 22:54.699
He works at Nassee
Pest Control,

22:54.701 --> 22:56.868
which specializes in
dangerous animal removal,

22:56.870 --> 22:58.536
and you don't even
have to ask me,

You cold?

23:25.030 --> 23:26.797
Yes.

23:26.799 --> 23:28.833
That's from the fever.

23:30.068 --> 23:32.336
Please just let me go.

23:32.338 --> 23:34.739
Please? Please
just let me go?

23:34.741 --> 23:36.908
I won't tell
anyone anything.

23:36.910 --> 23:40.945
I swear. Just let me go,
please.

23:42.047 --> 23:45.683

24:03.303 --> 24:07.305
No, no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just...

Clear.

26:02.363 --> 26:04.197
He's not here.

26:04.199 --> 26:06.499
I think it's safe to say
this guy's single

26:06.501 --> 26:08.935
and not in a relationship.

26:16.744 --> 26:18.778
Guys, look at this.

26:21.549 --> 26:24.317
I don't know, you think
we got the right guy?

26:38.866 --> 26:42.669
[Indistinct police radio]

26:51.712 --> 26:53.613
All right, thanks, baby girl.

26:53.615 --> 26:56.583
This Cunningham guy got fired
from his last two pest control jobs.

26:56.585 --> 26:58.685
Probably for stealing
equipment.

26:58.687 --> 27:00.220
You know, I bet that's
how he acquired

27:00.222 --> 27:02.689
his first sample
of the rabies virus, on his job.

27:02.691 --> 27:05.325
The acquisition of the virus
may have been the trigger itself.

27:05.327 --> 27:07.694
It's worth mentioning,
the only known rabies survival story

27:07.696 --> 27:09.362
that didn't involve
the vaccine

27:09.364 --> 27:10.864
happened right here
in Milwaukee.

27:10.866 --> 27:12.365
A 15-year-old girl
survived the virus

27:12.367 --> 27:14.567
when doctors put her
in a medically induced coma.

27:14.569 --> 27:16.202
You think
it's connected to this?

27:16.204 --> 27:17.871
Based on the sheer
proximity, it's possible,

27:17.873 --> 27:20.740
but given the lengths to which
the unsub goes to infect his victims,

27:20.742 --> 27:21.941
I think it's unlikely.

27:21.943 --> 27:23.743
Hey,
look what I found.

27:23.745 --> 27:25.345
It was hidden really
well in his closet.

27:25.347 --> 27:28.815
He did not want anyone
finding it and I think I know why.

doing here? Get out of here!

27:46.601 --> 27:49.068
Turn that damn thing off.

27:49.070 --> 27:51.971
1999--that was the year
his brother Hunter got rabies.

27:51.973 --> 27:53.574
By the time they got him
to the hospital,

27:53.575 --> 27:55.141
there was nothing
the doctors could do.

27:55.143 --> 27:58.278
It's possible the parents
brought him home to die instead.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.314
And then his big brother David
recorded the whole thing.

28:01.316 --> 28:03.549
He was 12 at the time.
That's an impressionable age

28:03.551 --> 28:05.218
for a single event imprint.

28:05.220 --> 28:07.153

some sort of psychopathic fascination

trying to satisfy.

watching my own son die,

consider euthanasia.

euthanizing Henry or anything. I'm just--

28:19.634 --> 28:21.267
No, Spence, that's it.

28:21.269 --> 28:23.903
That's why Garcia couldn't
find a death certificate

28:23.905 --> 28:25.071
for Hunter Cunningham.

28:25.073 --> 28:26.806
Because his parents
must have done it.

28:26.808 --> 28:28.207
They couldn't bear to watch,

28:28.209 --> 28:30.043
so they put him
out of his misery.

search the area.

There's nothing
they can do for her, huh?

33:02.388 --> 33:04.689
Comfort measures,
but that's about it.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.824
Rossi: Thanks, officer.

33:06.826 --> 33:09.193
We can't be far from where
he's holding them hostage.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.461
She was on foot.

33:10.463 --> 33:13.030
But in her state, how in God's name
did she escape?

33:13.032 --> 33:14.932
Reid, where are we
in relation to his hunting ground?

33:14.934 --> 33:15.900
Right in the middle of it.

33:15.902 --> 33:17.802
[Ring]
At your service, sir.

33:17.804 --> 33:20.504
Garcia, we're trying to figure out
what kind of building or property

33:20.506 --> 33:22.173
the unsub might be using.
What do you see

33:22.175 --> 33:24.075
in a 5-mile radius
of our current position?

33:24.077 --> 33:25.376
A lot of stuff.
What am I looking for?

33:25.378 --> 33:28.012
Anything relatively
isolated or industrial.

33:28.014 --> 33:31.215
Uh, it's mostly residential,
single-family homes,

33:31.217 --> 33:32.516
apartment buildings,
stuff like that.

33:32.518 --> 33:34.051
What about abandoned
properties?

33:34.053 --> 33:36.387
Not per se, but people don't usually
give notice when they do that.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.122
Let me see if there's
any condemned.

33:38.124 --> 33:39.123
No, nothing.

33:39.125 --> 33:40.758
What about properties
for sale?

33:40.760 --> 33:43.260
Let's see, 1, 2, 6 homes for sale.
All of them occupied.

33:43.262 --> 33:46.063
An apartment building
for sale, also occupied.

33:46.065 --> 33:48.599
It looks like the city
is selling some land.

33:48.601 --> 33:50.134
What's there?

33:50.136 --> 33:52.236
Uh, hold yourself.
It is a...

33:52.238 --> 33:53.704
Hello.
It's an animal shelter,

33:53.706 --> 33:55.606
but it's shut down
due to budget cuts.

33:55.608 --> 33:57.975
That's could be it, Garcia.
Send the address.

33:57.977 --> 33:59.810
Done and done.
Please be careful.

34:03.915 --> 34:06.016
[Moaning]

34:06.018 --> 34:08.319
Hey!

34:08.321 --> 34:10.955
Where are you?
I know you're in here.

34:10.956 --> 34:13.524
I can hear you.

34:14.860 --> 34:16.793
No...

[Moaning and screaming]

34:18.831 --> 34:21.232
Russell: I'm sick!
I need to go to the bathroom!

34:21.234 --> 34:22.233
Hunter: Please!
Please?

34:22.235 --> 34:24.534
Hunter: Let me go!
Let me go.

34:24.536 --> 34:27.103
I feel sick.

34:27.106 --> 34:30.007
I really gotta
go to the bathroom.

34:30.009 --> 34:31.842
Please!
Please!

34:31.844 --> 34:34.178
I gotta go!
I gotta go!

34:52.397 --> 34:55.900
Remember what I told you
before.

34:55.902 --> 34:57.201
Yes.

34:57.203 --> 34:59.203
Repeat it.

34:59.205 --> 35:01.906
If I run or fight,
I get the stick.

35:34.706 --> 35:36.407
Go ahead.

35:48.854 --> 35:49.854
[Dog barking]

35:49.856 --> 35:50.821
All right.

35:50.823 --> 35:52.323
S.W.A.T.'s
still 5 minutes out.

35:52.325 --> 35:54.325
All right, we can't wait.
We'll go in in two groups.

35:54.327 --> 35:56.961
We'll go in this door, you guys
take the west door down the alley.

35:56.963 --> 35:58.229
Let's go.

36:29.060 --> 36:30.194
What are you doing?

36:30.196 --> 36:31.629
I said lay down!

36:31.631 --> 36:33.163
Ok.

37:06.098 --> 37:08.566
JJ, you got him?
Go!

37:08.568 --> 37:12.136
Wait, ok. Please help me,
please, please.

37:25.483 --> 37:27.184
We have the entire place
is surrounded.

37:27.186 --> 37:28.886
You might as well come out.

37:30.322 --> 37:32.256

37:34.659 --> 37:38.128
Aah! Aah!

Aah!

38:04.022 --> 38:07.024
Ohh!

38:09.527 --> 38:10.794
Nice tackle, kid.

38:10.796 --> 38:13.330
Thanks. I've been
working out a little bit.

38:21.606 --> 38:24.074
Thanks, man.

38:26.411 --> 38:27.645
Pretty boy.

38:27.647 --> 38:29.813
I hope they didn't mess up
that face too bad.

38:29.815 --> 38:31.148
You know that's
your best asset.

38:31.150 --> 38:33.017
Luckily just some superficial
nicks and bruises.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.284
How are you doing?

38:34.286 --> 38:36.654
I just got a couple burns,
but I'll be all right.

38:36.656 --> 38:39.256
Found another body
at the disposal site.

38:39.258 --> 38:40.991
Hunter Cunningham?

38:40.993 --> 38:42.493
Well, we're still awaiting
DNA confirmation,

38:42.495 --> 38:44.595
but they're the skeletal
remains of a 9-year-old boy,

38:44.597 --> 38:46.864
So...
It's gotta be him.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.167
You guys ready
to get out of here?

38:50.169 --> 38:52.002
Yes, please.
I can't stand hospitals.

38:52.004 --> 38:53.737
It's something
about the lighting.

38:53.739 --> 38:55.873
Who's Rossi
talking to?

38:55.875 --> 38:58.442
The Foley family.

39:04.082 --> 39:06.884
She slipped into a coma.

39:09.554 --> 39:12.423
It won't be long now.

39:13.425 --> 39:16.093
Excuse me, agents?

39:16.095 --> 39:21.231
Um, the doctors, they said
that I'm gonna be ok.

39:21.233 --> 39:24.134
And I...

39:24.136 --> 39:26.704
I just--I don't know
how to thank you guys.

39:26.706 --> 39:28.172
No, there's no need.

39:28.174 --> 39:29.973

Ok.

39:51.863 --> 39:53.163
[Groans]

39:53.165 --> 39:54.631
You think they'll really
terminate us

39:54.633 --> 39:56.300
if we can't
run fast enough?

39:56.302 --> 39:56.902
Probably something worse.

39:56.927 --> 39:58.768
They'll probably make us
take another fit test.

39:59.205 --> 40:00.404
I'd rather be terminated.

40:00.406 --> 40:02.473
I just hope the P.T.
instructor isn't a jerk.

40:02.475 --> 40:04.675
Those jock guys
are always such jerks.

40:04.677 --> 40:05.843
Yeah, total jerks.

40:05.845 --> 40:07.578
That's probably him
right now.

40:07.580 --> 40:10.481
Oh, look. He's totally
walking like a jerk.

40:10.483 --> 40:12.416
Yeah, it's a total
jerk walk.

Total jerk walk.
Wait a minute.

Oh, my God, it is.

P.T. instructor.

so today's your lucky day.

you should have
just said something.

40:32.171 --> 40:34.104
This whole fit test thing
is just a formality.

40:34.106 --> 40:37.374
I could've got
the whole thing waived.

But since you didn't,

you ready to do this?

No, no, no.
You didn't hear?

than just a mile.
