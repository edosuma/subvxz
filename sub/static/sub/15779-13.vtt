WEBVTT

00:05.250 --> 00:07.710
Hup! 74, 75--

00:07.840 --> 00:08.840
General Treister?

00:08.960 --> 00:10.960
Hold on! 77!

00:11.090 --> 00:13.300
Bingo. Whoo!

00:13.430 --> 00:15.800
Heh, throw me that towel, son.

00:15.930 --> 00:16.970
Squat thrusts!

00:17.100 --> 00:19.390
One for every year
this bone bag refuses...

00:19.510 --> 00:21.520
to crawl under the porch and die.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.980
Let's go, big boy!

00:23.100 --> 00:25.190
You better get in step or so help me...

00:25.310 --> 00:27.980
I'll nail you to the wall
of the ladies' room!

00:28.110 --> 00:30.070
There ya go! Knew you could do it.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.980
Now what can I do you for, my boys?

00:32.110 --> 00:33.070
Ya here to wrestle me?

00:33.190 --> 00:35.740
Eh, no sir, it's Agent 92-62.

00:35.860 --> 00:38.320
Samson! That boy's gonna give me
another heart attack.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.330
My ninth, if we're counting.
And we are!

00:40.450 --> 00:41.410
What has he done now?

00:41.540 --> 00:44.500
Agent Samson has just turned
the O.S.I. list of top assassins...

00:44.620 --> 00:45.830
into the obituary page.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.040
Handy if you're an editor.

00:47.170 --> 00:49.960
But a pain in the patoot if you're me!

00:50.090 --> 00:52.170
Who's down?

00:52.300 --> 00:53.510
Don't use that one!

00:53.630 --> 00:56.010
It's set to record
Battlestar Galactica .

00:56.130 --> 00:57.180
Number six...

00:57.300 --> 00:58.510
Try to blame me!

00:59.970 --> 01:01.390
Herr Trigger, sniper.

01:01.510 --> 01:03.100
Found in a dumpster outside
of a strip club.

01:03.220 --> 01:05.269
Apparently he's a bad tipper.

01:05.390 --> 01:07.100
Go-fish, at-sea assassin.

01:07.230 --> 01:10.230
Body washed up on a public beach.
Still waiting for the head.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.190
Le Tueur, big game hunter.
Presumed dead.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.530
He doesn't answer his cell phone.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.530
If you met the guy, you'd understand.

01:16.650 --> 01:18.700
Ehh, too much public killing.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.410
In my day, we'd draw the curtains...

01:21.530 --> 01:23.830
before we punched a man's time clock.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.330
Boys, we gotta put an end...

01:25.460 --> 01:28.210
to this small town talent show
ourselves.

01:28.330 --> 01:31.210
It's already gone on well past
the fat lady's encore.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.500
What's our next move, sir?

01:32.630 --> 01:33.920
A-squad vanquisher...

01:34.050 --> 01:36.010
packed to the attic
with assault doohickies!

01:36.130 --> 01:38.260
And daddy's gonna sit in the big chair.

01:38.380 --> 01:39.300
Yes, sir.

01:39.430 --> 01:41.010
I'm gonna personally make damn sure...

01:41.140 --> 01:43.680
we end this Samson problem, A-SAP!

01:43.810 --> 01:45.850
Let's move out!

01:49.600 --> 01:51.110
I should get dressed, I guess.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.470 --> 02:27.140
You'll never get me to talk, pigs.

02:27.270 --> 02:30.270
We got you at the scene,
covered in the victim's blood...

02:30.400 --> 02:32.400
with the murder weapon on the floor.

02:32.520 --> 02:37.480
You better start flappin' those gums
or you're lookin' at life plus 20, Tralfaz.

02:37.610 --> 02:39.280
Um, may I say something?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.860
I'm not really "with" him... Ow!

02:41.990 --> 02:44.120
Tralfaz. What is that, Polish?

02:44.240 --> 02:47.120
It's Spanish for "go fuck yourself."

02:47.250 --> 02:49.040
H-He doesn't speak for both of us.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.620
Ow!

02:50.750 --> 02:52.290
I-I don't think--
I don't think that's true.

02:52.420 --> 02:53.790
My wife speaks a little Spanish.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.500
Hold on, I'm gonna call her-- Ow! Hey!

02:55.630 --> 02:57.460
I'm sorry, you think
maybe we can stick to...

02:57.590 --> 02:59.510
you know,
questioning the suspects here?

02:59.630 --> 03:01.970
What is this,
the bad cop - retarded cop routine?

03:02.090 --> 03:03.220
OK! OK!

03:03.340 --> 03:06.050
We'll tell you everything
you want to know!

03:06.180 --> 03:07.180
I'd like my own counsel.

03:07.310 --> 03:09.640
I told you, boys. You're not under arrest.

03:09.770 --> 03:12.560
I just want to ask you a few questions.

03:12.690 --> 03:15.110
Let's start with this "Brock"
you keep talking about.

03:15.230 --> 03:16.270
Who is he?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.230
He's our bodyguard.
He protects us.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.940
Does "Brock" speak to you?

03:20.070 --> 03:22.070
- 'Course.
- Both of you?

03:22.200 --> 03:23.740
- Duh.
- OK.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.490
Does Brock ever...
tell you what to do?

03:26.620 --> 03:29.330
Yeah. Well, sometimes.
Sorta. I guess.

03:29.450 --> 03:33.000
Mm hmm.
And this robot friend of yours, this...

03:33.120 --> 03:34.170
"Helper."

03:34.290 --> 03:35.580
Does he speak to you, too?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.970
One last chance.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.090
Where is Venture?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.010
Did he tell us?

03:49.140 --> 03:50.850
It seemed like he was being sarcastic.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.190
See, it's the upwards inflection.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.190
It doesn't really feel like directions.

03:56.310 --> 03:59.570
You tell us where Venture is
or we break something...

03:59.690 --> 04:00.610
Comprende?

04:05.870 --> 04:06.870
Oh! Nice move, dick.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.870
Oh shit! I busted him!

04:08.990 --> 04:10.240
Dude, I barely tapped it!

04:10.370 --> 04:11.700
I swear! I'm wicked sorry.

04:11.830 --> 04:12.870
Don't apologize!

04:13.000 --> 04:15.620
Now he knows we mean business.

04:15.750 --> 04:19.290
Now you tell me
Venture's location or we--

04:19.420 --> 04:20.630
Knock off your head?

04:20.760 --> 04:21.800
Again...

04:21.920 --> 04:23.420
intentionally!

04:23.550 --> 04:25.430
So what's your relationship...

04:25.550 --> 04:26.800
with this Le Tueur character?

04:26.930 --> 04:27.890
Never heard of him.

04:28.010 --> 04:29.720
Oh, maybe this'll refresh your memory.

04:29.850 --> 04:32.390
The stiff in your room split
straight up the garanimals?

04:32.520 --> 04:34.390
Eh, good luck pickin' up that spare.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.140
W-What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

04:36.270 --> 04:37.560
You know, 'cause he cut him in half.

04:37.690 --> 04:39.820
It's like a 7-1 0 split. Like in bowling.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.070
But, you know, with a guy.

04:41.190 --> 04:43.070
That is... downright esoteric.

04:43.190 --> 04:44.070
I got it right away.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.990
You... shut your mouth.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.200
Do we get socked on the lips
every time we talk...

04:48.320 --> 04:50.330
or only when we make a point? Ow.

04:51.370 --> 04:52.240
So that's--

04:52.370 --> 04:53.660
that's every time then?

04:53.790 --> 04:56.120
Oh, alright. Fine.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.080
I'll tell you everything.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.750
- Can I get one of those?
- No.

05:07.090 --> 05:09.970
My family and I have been on the run
from an elite squad of super-assassins...

05:10.100 --> 05:12.560
who've been trying to kill our bodyguard
since last night.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.810
If you don't let us go so we can help him
he'll probably be dead by morning.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.270
Fascinating. Now, if we could...

05:18.400 --> 05:21.610
let's get back to this giant butterfly.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.530
Look, I told you what you want to know.

05:23.650 --> 05:25.190
Now gimme my phone call!

05:25.320 --> 05:27.280
OK fine, boys. This is--

05:27.410 --> 05:29.110
this is a good place
to take a break.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.410
Eh, who would you like to call?

05:30.530 --> 05:32.280
Hello, Pop? This guy's a tool.

05:34.450 --> 05:36.960
OK, that stung!

05:37.080 --> 05:38.620
I have delicate joints...

05:38.750 --> 05:40.630
You gentlemen are free to go.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.790
Uncuff 'em, detectives. Now.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.050
Aww, why?

05:44.170 --> 05:46.010
No body, no case. It's over.

05:46.130 --> 05:48.130
Whoa whoa!
What are you talking about no body?!

05:48.260 --> 05:50.300
That room looked like the set
from Saw freakin' one!

05:50.430 --> 05:53.310
Nope... The room
was down right Martha Stewart.

05:53.430 --> 05:54.810
Forensics couldn't find dick...

05:54.930 --> 05:58.600
except for a faint, eh,
lemony fresh kinda odor.

05:58.730 --> 06:00.560
I can still smell it.

06:00.690 --> 06:01.650
Aaah!

06:05.820 --> 06:07.190
Oh no no! No, no!

06:07.320 --> 06:08.950
Aaahh!

06:14.740 --> 06:17.290
Let me guess. You're The Cleaner?

06:18.460 --> 06:20.920
Alright, smart guy. We played it nice.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.670
Venture's location.

06:22.790 --> 06:24.130
You have three seconds....

06:24.250 --> 06:27.380
2, 1 ...

06:27.510 --> 06:29.340
OK 24, light him up.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.470
Do I connect the positive side first or--

06:31.590 --> 06:36.220
Who cares?
He's not a Mitsubishi Galant, just do it.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.390
What the hell are you doing to him?

06:38.520 --> 06:39.560
Ah! Honey?

06:39.690 --> 06:41.560
We were just asking him stuff.

06:41.690 --> 06:44.020
Oh, you poor sweet thing.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.570
Did the bad men hurt you?

06:48.530 --> 06:52.450
Monarch, this goes against
the Guild Sentience Conference of 1 998!

06:52.570 --> 06:54.530
We have to bring him back to his family.

06:54.660 --> 06:57.290
Your family must miss you.

06:57.410 --> 06:59.870
Let's find them and get you
back to safety.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.170
Alright, run these numbers
through the NAV-COMM.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.000
It's somewhere in California.

07:08.130 --> 07:11.010
That dirty fucking robot got
grease all over my dress.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.720
Sweetie, your "good-cop" is chilling.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.850
That was so hot...

07:14.970 --> 07:16.560
Hot, hot cop.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.640
Wee! ! !

07:22.770 --> 07:24.690
Eh, this is as far as I go.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.570
There's a rental car waiting for you
quarter of a mile south of here.

07:27.690 --> 07:30.030
Keys and a new I.D.
In the glove box, Cochise.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.190
Good luck to ya man.

07:31.320 --> 07:35.530
Yeah, I uh, only got
one problem with that plan--

07:36.200 --> 07:38.080
Hank never called you.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.620
I did.

07:39.750 --> 07:43.210
Figured even the mighty
Brock Samson might have trouble...

07:43.330 --> 07:45.380
fighting the entire O.S.I.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.090
Molotov.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.800
I don't know why I'm surprised.
How'd you find us?

07:49.920 --> 07:51.920
You haven't exactly been discreet.

07:52.050 --> 07:54.130
Oh, like that get-up is?

07:54.260 --> 07:56.470
Though I gotta admit,
for a disguise, it's pretty good.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.760
Hardly recognized ya.

07:57.890 --> 08:00.770
W-What disg--? I'm off-duty.

08:00.890 --> 08:01.930
Ha ha ha! That's--

08:02.060 --> 08:04.940
that's how you dress when
you're not catwoman-ing around?

08:05.060 --> 08:07.770
I might have to rethink
this whole relationship.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.320
Who's that hood rat
Brock's talking to?

08:10.440 --> 08:13.070
He can get any shorty he wants.

08:14.910 --> 08:17.990
More of your friends, Molotov?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.450
Molotov?

08:20.620 --> 08:22.000
Venture!

08:22.120 --> 08:25.580
Come out, come out
wherever you are...

08:25.710 --> 08:27.170
Ugh. Really?

08:27.290 --> 08:28.500
Eh, clichéd, I know.

08:28.630 --> 08:31.130
Trust me, it sounds
extra-creepy over the P.A.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.590
Hello, Dr. Venture.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.799
I hope you don't mind
I called your private number.

08:37.929 --> 08:39.850
Your robot gave it to me.

08:42.270 --> 08:46.850
And if you ever want to see him
alive again you will show yourself.

08:47.770 --> 08:48.690
Is he serious?

08:48.810 --> 08:49.770
Deadly! ! !

08:49.900 --> 08:52.030
You have exactly one minute to--

08:52.150 --> 08:53.150
Aw, check it out.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.360
When you turn on night vision
with the lights on...

08:55.490 --> 08:58.870
it's like an X-ray camera. Kinda.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.450
Samson!

09:01.580 --> 09:04.750
What in the hell
do you think you're doin'?

09:04.870 --> 09:07.540
Still breathing,
General Treister, sir.

09:07.670 --> 09:08.630
No thanks to you.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.590
Aw, you're lookin' fine, son.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.300
Glad to see you finally took
that mop top down to regulation.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.510
Cut the crap, sir.
What do you want from me?

09:15.630 --> 09:18.840
The O.S.I. wants you
to come in from the cold, son.

09:18.970 --> 09:22.350
It's high time we had us
a li'l old fashioned pow-wow.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.980
And put a stop to this situation.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.560
I think we're way past that, sir.

09:27.690 --> 09:29.230
Now, now, now don't go gettin'...

09:29.360 --> 09:31.270
all "first blood" on me, boy.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.650
You got a family to think about.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.990
How long you really think
you're gonna last out there...

09:35.110 --> 09:36.530
in the wilderness
with those Ventures?

09:36.650 --> 09:38.700
They're not part of this.
I don't want them harmed.

09:38.820 --> 09:41.490
They won't be if you just do what we say.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.330
Now why don't you just give us
the coordinates...

09:44.450 --> 09:46.160
like a good soldier...

09:46.290 --> 09:48.540
20 seconds, Venture.
What's it gonna be?

09:48.670 --> 09:51.000
Nineteen...

09:51.130 --> 09:53.340
Alright. I'll give you what you want.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.840
But it goes down the way
I say it does.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.590
We meet at the Venture Compound.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.760
Dawn.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.310
Dawn?! Ha! Dean--

10:03.430 --> 10:06.100
We're finally gonna meet
our long lost sister!

10:13.690 --> 10:15.610
Wake up! We're here.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.940
Gather round my winged flock!

10:18.070 --> 10:20.160
Eh, my breath.

10:22.660 --> 10:23.580
Go! Run!

10:23.700 --> 10:25.790
Head for the panic room quick.
And stay low!

10:25.910 --> 10:28.870
Aw, every time something
remotely cool happens...

10:29.000 --> 10:31.580
it's "get in the panic room!" Unfair!

10:31.710 --> 10:33.670
Alright, alright,
can't I at least change first?

10:33.790 --> 10:36.670
This has to be the most
uncomfortable thing I've ever worn.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.260
Today is a day which will live long...

10:39.380 --> 10:41.720
in the annals of Monarch history!

10:41.840 --> 10:43.430
With the sun at our backs we shall--

10:43.550 --> 10:44.800
Uh, M-Monarch--?

10:44.930 --> 10:48.140
Ah! Do. Not. Interrupt!

10:48.270 --> 10:49.560
There. You happy now?

10:49.690 --> 10:50.600
Look what you did.

10:50.730 --> 10:52.600
Now you don't get to go on
the murder crusade!

10:52.730 --> 10:56.230
Honey, what the hell are we doing here?
This is obviously a trap.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.650
Damn right it is!

10:57.780 --> 10:59.690
But whom is trapping whom?

11:00.570 --> 11:02.410
Let's just say I took the liberty...

11:02.530 --> 11:05.160
of upgrading
his precious robot's equipment...

11:05.280 --> 11:07.870
with two gigabytes of kablam!

11:19.300 --> 11:20.630
The big chair!

11:21.970 --> 11:23.300
Right on schedule.

11:23.430 --> 11:26.220
Samson! Hup bah, what's the what?

11:26.350 --> 11:28.010
We ready to do this thing?

11:28.140 --> 11:30.270
Well, Venture... here we are again.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.730
Uh, hang on just a sec', General.

11:32.850 --> 11:33.850
Di--?

11:33.980 --> 11:35.860
That son of a bitch just put me on hold?

11:35.980 --> 11:38.900
Your fancy new plane
won't save you, Venture.

11:39.030 --> 11:43.700
We're having this out, here and now
once and for all!

11:43.820 --> 11:45.700
Oh, I couldn't agree
with you more, Monarch.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.910
Why don't ya come on around
back and say hello?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.910
I'd be delighted.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.290
Sugar crown, we don't even
know what that thing can do.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.380
Oh, sweetness...

11:55.500 --> 11:56.920
Why do you think
we have henchmen?

11:57.040 --> 12:00.840
Besides, he's Rusty Venture
not the O. S. Freaking I.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.800
Anything he can throw at us
we can throw back tenfold!

12:05.180 --> 12:06.090
Sorry 'bout that, General.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.050
What were ya, tyin' yer boots?

12:08.180 --> 12:10.720
Are you comin' out
or are ya gonna make us...

12:10.850 --> 12:13.060
come in there and get you?

12:13.190 --> 12:15.270
Won't be necessary, sir.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.060
I'm a comin' around now...

12:22.400 --> 12:24.990
Uh, sir? Can we get an order here?

12:25.110 --> 12:26.160
Fire!

12:30.660 --> 12:32.000
Who the hell are those guys?

12:32.120 --> 12:33.750
They're henchmen for the Monarch, sir.

12:33.870 --> 12:35.330
What in the hell's a Monarch?

12:35.460 --> 12:38.040
Low level Guild troublemaker.
Used to arch Dr. Venture.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.630
Then he arched Dr. Venture.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.170
Aw, come on, General.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.340
That any way to treat my friends?

12:43.470 --> 12:45.300
Those clowns are with you?

12:45.430 --> 12:48.850
What in hell is going on here, Samson?

12:48.970 --> 12:51.470
Just tryin' to even
the playing field a little, sir.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.890
Looks like Samson's gone
over to the Guild, sir.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.810
Want me to give the order
to take out the big cocoon?

12:56.940 --> 12:58.020
Is that what that thing is?

12:58.150 --> 13:00.320
Jeepers crappers, no.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.940
If Samson's pulled a full-on Judas
there's no tellin'...

13:03.070 --> 13:05.280
what kinda trade secrets
he might've given up.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.740
I want him alive. Ground forces!

13:07.870 --> 13:09.240
Henchmen!

13:09.370 --> 13:10.620
Form battle squadrons...

13:10.740 --> 13:13.620
and prepare for full assault
on my order!

13:13.750 --> 13:15.460
I told you...

13:15.580 --> 13:17.960
- We should just leave already.
- Oh stop yourself.

13:18.080 --> 13:22.460
Moppets!
Prepare my Death's Head Panoply!

13:31.180 --> 13:32.640
There it is again!

13:32.770 --> 13:35.390
I'm telling ya there's like
a skunk ape out there or something.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.310
Hank, sit down and pretend to be sane.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.940
Dean, what are you doing?

13:39.060 --> 13:40.730
I can't feel my left arm.

13:40.860 --> 13:42.610
How old do you have to be
to have a heart attack?

13:42.730 --> 13:44.610
In regular years, or pansy years?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.280
Whatever! Why!?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.200
Why can't I just have a normal life?

13:48.320 --> 13:50.370
I had that dream once too.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.450
Open up!

13:52.580 --> 13:53.950
Aahh! Sergeant Hatred!

13:54.080 --> 13:55.870
What the hell is he doing here?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.330
You're just gonna let him in?
He's Pop's arch enemy!

13:58.460 --> 14:00.750
Yeah technically, like on paper.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.210
Hello, ladies.

14:04.340 --> 14:05.840
Where's your old man at?

14:05.970 --> 14:07.800
Behind those boxes. Hiding from you.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.010
- Thanks, Hank.
- There you are!

14:10.140 --> 14:12.680
OK, you have to kill me.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.350
I've been here for like two
days trying to do it myself.

14:15.470 --> 14:18.640
I tried to blow my head off
with a damn shrink ray.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.900
Now I got a little baby tongue.

14:21.020 --> 14:23.690
I'm a failure.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.150
What's wrong with him?

14:25.280 --> 14:26.230
He's having a heart attack.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.990
Look Nelly-boy,
you don't know of heart pain!

14:29.110 --> 14:30.860
I've tried to change.

14:30.990 --> 14:34.700
I quit the sauce, the cigars,
the young boys.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.000
And she still left me!

14:37.120 --> 14:39.710
Mister Hatred,
could you stop yelling please?

14:39.830 --> 14:40.870
Honestly.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.590
Come on, man! Kill me! ! !

14:51.840 --> 14:52.720
Attack.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.010
Attack! !

14:56.770 --> 14:58.020
Attaack! !

15:22.370 --> 15:23.290
Tortilla chip?

15:23.420 --> 15:25.790
They are not only cool, they are ranch.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.630
Totally. What are you doing?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.590
I'm creating realistic battle damage.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.090
So when we join them at the end...

15:31.220 --> 15:32.720
it'll look like I've seen some action.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.720
It'll look like rubbed snack on your face.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.680
Oh! Listen to that!

15:37.890 --> 15:39.100
Did you just hear that guy?

15:39.220 --> 15:40.480
That guy right there.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.440
That is a guy on fire!
You can totally tell.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.520
What the!?

15:44.650 --> 15:46.610
Ah crap, he's stealing our hiding place!

15:46.730 --> 15:47.900
Dude! Bail!

15:48.230 --> 15:49.110
Come on!

15:49.230 --> 15:51.900
I can't! My seat belt is jammed!

15:52.030 --> 15:53.110
Why'd you buckle it?!

15:53.240 --> 15:54.780
Why would you do that!?

15:54.910 --> 15:57.080
I don't know!

15:58.240 --> 16:01.250
Why did you buckle up!? Why?!

16:01.370 --> 16:03.370
Just choke me!

16:03.500 --> 16:05.710
Choke my neck! Damn you!

16:05.830 --> 16:07.290
Strangle my pain away...

16:07.420 --> 16:08.420
please!

16:08.550 --> 16:09.550
Look, crazy.

16:09.670 --> 16:12.130
So your teen bride left you. Big whoop.

16:12.260 --> 16:13.970
Is she really worth ending everything--

16:14.090 --> 16:15.130
Hank! What are you doing?!

16:15.260 --> 16:16.760
I'm going out there.

16:16.890 --> 16:17.970
Brock needs me!

16:18.100 --> 16:21.430
That boy is not even close
to a chip off the old block.

16:21.560 --> 16:22.730
He's got guts!

16:22.850 --> 16:24.640
Excuse me?
You don't know me.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.310
Why in my prime, I saw some things...

16:26.440 --> 16:27.810
that would make your head spin.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.860
Yeah, I saw a guy's head spin.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.110
Like right off his neck.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.110
Why? Because I punched him! Top that!

16:34.240 --> 16:35.410
OK... OK!

16:35.530 --> 16:37.490
My father made me kill a man--

16:37.620 --> 16:39.580
kill a man with a house key!

16:39.700 --> 16:41.490
- I was ten!
- Oh, that's nothing!

16:41.620 --> 16:44.250
I ate a whole Labrador Retriever once!

16:44.370 --> 16:45.290
I'm serious!

16:45.420 --> 16:46.580
Blah, blah! All this talk!

16:46.710 --> 16:48.500
We gotta do something!

16:48.630 --> 16:50.340
Brock is being attacked
by his friends.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.510
Your real arch enemy
is trying to kill you...

16:52.630 --> 16:55.340
and you're swapping war stories
with Sergeant Kill Me!

16:55.470 --> 16:57.840
Wow! I like this one.

16:57.970 --> 16:59.510
- And he is right.
- He's crazy.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.850
He's gonna get us killed!

17:00.970 --> 17:03.430
No, he has got something.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.520
Look at us.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.060
We are hiding from our true selves.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.109
I'm a fighter, not a lover!

17:09.230 --> 17:10.150
And you...

17:10.270 --> 17:11.770
you were Rusty Venture once.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.280
Maybe the most fearless
Boy Adventurer ever.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.319
Maybe the most?

17:15.450 --> 17:16.450
And Hank here...

17:16.569 --> 17:18.490
Hank is becoming a man.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.240
I can feel it in my bones!

17:20.369 --> 17:21.530
And Dean...

17:21.660 --> 17:22.619
Dean is--

17:22.750 --> 17:23.829
Sensitive.

17:23.950 --> 17:25.200
He'll come around!

17:25.329 --> 17:28.620
Now let's get out there
and show those frail flowers...

17:28.750 --> 17:30.500
who the hell they're dealing with!

17:30.630 --> 17:33.050
Let's pretend this is a good idea.

17:33.170 --> 17:34.210
We'd need an army--

17:34.340 --> 17:35.260
We've got one!

17:35.380 --> 17:36.670
Hank, there are only four--

17:36.800 --> 17:39.050
um, three and a half of us.

17:39.180 --> 17:42.060
Not if you let me open
my Christmas gifts early...

17:42.180 --> 17:43.510
there aren't.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.360
Ten- hut!

18:02.910 --> 18:04.580
Left left...

18:04.700 --> 18:07.080
left right left...

18:07.210 --> 18:09.080
left left...

18:09.210 --> 18:10.750
left right left!

18:29.020 --> 18:32.770
Company halt!

18:32.900 --> 18:33.820
He did it!

18:33.940 --> 18:35.690
Sgt. Hatred saved the day!

18:35.820 --> 18:37.110
And we helped!

18:37.240 --> 18:38.490
Kinda!

18:38.610 --> 18:40.860
Go Team Venture! ! !

18:43.240 --> 18:46.450
Oh, God! Oh, no no no!

18:47.410 --> 18:49.370
Whoa whoa whoa! Cease fire!

18:49.500 --> 18:50.460
Cease fire!

18:54.340 --> 18:57.000
Alright look just...
just put your weapons down!

18:57.130 --> 18:58.670
I give up, OK?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.630
Now let me talk to General Treister.

19:07.390 --> 19:10.560
All right put me here,
and give me the megaphone.

19:11.810 --> 19:12.980
Hold it up for me.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.560
I- I can't move my arms.

19:14.690 --> 19:16.440
Enemies of the Monarch!

19:16.570 --> 19:20.150
Behold my impressive
Death's Head Panoply!

19:20.280 --> 19:22.610
The final solution in tailoring!

19:22.740 --> 19:24.820
Recoil in terror...

19:24.950 --> 19:26.660
as the mighty Monarch
goes supernova!

19:26.790 --> 19:29.580
Oh, sweet tights, not that.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.330
You never tested it.

19:31.460 --> 19:33.040
You are gonna kill yourself.

19:33.170 --> 19:37.340
Why do you always have
to take that last step over the crazy edge?

19:37.460 --> 19:40.670
And now I write this
battle's final chapter...

19:40.800 --> 19:43.430
with the blood of my enemies!

19:43.550 --> 19:46.180
It's the little button on the sleeve.

19:54.310 --> 19:56.270
Well, there's my life's
work up in smoke.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.190
Oh, God!

19:58.320 --> 19:59.860
I feel like I'm the one dying.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.030
We should be out there with them!

20:02.150 --> 20:04.200
We should be fighting side by side...

20:04.320 --> 20:05.820
with our moist warrior brethren! !

20:05.950 --> 20:06.870
Ah, ba ba ba.

20:06.990 --> 20:08.910
Just take it down a notch, Hank.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.370
You only live once.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.210
Aah! Aaaah!

20:14.330 --> 20:16.500
Aaaaahhhh!

20:16.630 --> 20:18.340
Help! Help help!

20:23.300 --> 20:24.800
Oh, God.

20:24.930 --> 20:27.510
Sure got a funny way
of thankin' people, Samson.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.640
Fly all the way here to save
your butt and what do we get?

20:30.770 --> 20:32.100
Face full of moth people!

20:32.230 --> 20:33.430
They're butterflies, sir.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.390
Really?
'The hell I'm thinking of, then?

20:35.520 --> 20:36.900
- Emperor moths?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.400
What are you talkin' about,
savin' my butt?

20:39.520 --> 20:41.150
You sicced those three goons on it!

20:41.280 --> 20:45.570
And then when they weren't enough
you came here to finish the job yourselves.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.370
Boy, I don't know what
the hell you're talkin' about.

20:48.490 --> 20:52.500
All I know is when O.S.I. hears
one of its baby chicks is in trouble...

20:52.620 --> 20:54.830
Momma comes a-runnin'
and a-squawkin, and a-runnin.

20:54.960 --> 20:55.920
That's how we do.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.500
Then you didn't uh...

20:57.630 --> 20:58.750
you're not...

20:58.880 --> 21:00.460
I was never...

21:00.590 --> 21:01.550
Ah shit.

21:01.670 --> 21:05.050
Son, I believe your mind has gone AWOL.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.380
I shoulda seen this comin'.

21:06.510 --> 21:09.050
Your work's been gettin' sloppy
across the board, boy.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.930
Public killins',
abuse of company property--

21:12.060 --> 21:14.310
and none of your reports on Dr. Venture...

21:14.430 --> 21:17.400
ever mentioned nuthin'
'bout no illegal clone farm.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.110
You...you send them reports about me?

21:19.230 --> 21:21.690
Maybe you've been on this detail too long.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.860
Why don't you come back with us...

21:23.990 --> 21:25.950
so we can find you a nice,
new assignment?

21:26.070 --> 21:28.610
Maybe somethin' a little easier
on the ol' noggin'?

21:28.740 --> 21:30.120
Thank you. No, sir.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.540
I've seen enough
spinning butterfly...

21:32.660 --> 21:34.790
naked boy armies...

21:34.910 --> 21:35.830
Screw this.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.750
I'd rather, uh, quit.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.500
Yeah, you tell him, Brock!

21:40.630 --> 21:41.750
Well good for you!

21:41.880 --> 21:44.260
O.S.I., who needs 'em?

21:44.380 --> 21:45.760
Where are you going?

21:45.880 --> 21:47.510
Aren't you going to help
clean up this mess?

21:47.630 --> 21:49.430
I said I quit.

21:50.930 --> 21:52.510
You know...

21:52.640 --> 21:54.060
I could use a job.

21:56.890 --> 21:57.940
Hey, Monarch!

21:58.060 --> 21:58.980
Huh?

21:59.100 --> 22:00.650
I'm takin' your fuckin' car.

22:00.770 --> 22:01.900
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.070
Twenty Four!

22:05.190 --> 22:06.610
Nooo! ! !

22:06.740 --> 22:07.860
Ow!

22:37.140 --> 22:39.350
So much for our competition.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.770
Congratulations, ladies.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.190
Just as we planned...

22:43.320 --> 22:46.110
we are now the top assassins
in the country.

22:46.230 --> 22:48.320
The Blackhearts Elimination Agency...

22:48.450 --> 22:50.860
is officially open for business.

22:50.990 --> 22:53.950
Thanks to Mr. Brock Samson.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.580
To Brock Samson!

22:55.700 --> 22:57.330
Long live that blonde haired...
