00:03.289 --> 00:04.623
The wedding is in two weeks!

00:04.648 --> 00:06.209
I want to become...

00:06.234 --> 00:07.233
A priest?!

00:07.235 --> 00:08.768
Josh is leaving me

00:08.770 --> 00:09.769
to become

00:09.771 --> 00:10.870
a priest?

00:10.872 --> 00:12.438
I'm gonna mail him my poop.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.741
But tell him it's cupcakes.

00:14.766 --> 00:17.029
We are all here to
help you take down Josh,

00:17.054 --> 00:18.878
but we are not gonna help you

00:18.880 --> 00:21.380
take down yourself at the same time.

00:21.382 --> 00:23.015
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I was just, uh,

00:23.017 --> 00:24.717
I was just running by, and, um...

00:24.719 --> 00:26.820
You are understandably
obsessed with me.

00:26.845 --> 00:27.520
No.

00:27.522 --> 00:29.388
Sue him. Suing Josh,

00:29.390 --> 00:30.690
that's actually a
really interesting idea.

00:30.692 --> 00:33.412
There is tons of case law
that justifies suing him

00:33.437 --> 00:34.636
on behalf of Rebecca.

00:34.638 --> 00:35.546
It's perfect!

00:35.571 --> 00:38.205
This révenge will actually
make you feel better.

00:38.230 --> 00:39.363

your first revenge idea

01:33.736 --> 01:37.271
was to mail Josh poop
in plastic containers?

01:37.273 --> 01:39.439
- Yeah.
- Yeah, wow.

01:39.441 --> 01:42.476
That was a silly thing that
I definitely did not do.

01:42.478 --> 01:44.912
Josh is about to get
what's coming to him.

01:44.914 --> 01:46.687
- Not poop.
- Not poop!

01:46.712 --> 01:47.355
Anything but poop.

01:47.380 --> 01:49.008
Definitely not poop.
Anything but poop.

01:49.033 --> 01:51.389
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, he's such a loser, anyway.

01:52.743 --> 01:54.273
I mean, what a fool.

01:54.298 --> 01:55.644
I would've loved to have been

01:55.646 --> 01:57.584
a cross on the wall at that seminary
when he showed up there, right?

01:57.609 --> 01:58.678
- Err!
- Eh!

01:58.703 --> 02:00.436
Where's Jesus? Duh!

02:00.461 --> 02:02.561
Can I still have sex and be a priest?

02:02.586 --> 02:04.019
- No.
- No, you can't.

02:04.044 --> 02:06.694

Let's just say there were a
few things going on in my life

02:33.919 --> 02:36.119
that I feel a little guilty about.

02:36.121 --> 02:39.998
Like a wedding I was
supposed to go to and didn't.

02:40.826 --> 02:43.660
But I don't have to feel
that way anymore, because...

02:43.662 --> 02:46.879
I'm going to be a priest and
priests have no guilt, right?

05:13.378 --> 05:15.952
I am so honored to meet you.

05:16.581 --> 05:19.182
Father, I have come
here to this holy place

05:19.184 --> 05:22.452
to join my brethren and
walk the halls of divinity

05:22.454 --> 05:24.821
as God shines his light on me.

05:25.015 --> 05:27.133
- Oh, boy, we got a Maria here.
- What?

05:27.936 --> 05:31.628
Son, have you been considering
the priesthood for a long time?

05:31.630 --> 05:34.631
Oh, yeah. The whole drive
up here from Malibu today.

05:34.633 --> 05:36.099
And there was a Sig Alert.

05:39.874 --> 05:43.940
Well... I hope you understand,
it's a big commitment.

05:43.942 --> 05:44.841
A typical priest's training

05:44.843 --> 05:46.743
takes four to six years and involves

05:46.745 --> 05:48.811
getting a master's degree in divinity.

05:48.997 --> 05:51.489
And you'll have to take
a pre-theology class.

05:51.911 --> 05:54.817
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.520
"Erry-one" knows that.

05:57.522 --> 05:58.955
It's in the damn Bible.

05:59.864 --> 06:00.990
Oh, sorry.

06:00.992 --> 06:04.027
- Look, if you haven't really
- thought this through,

06:04.029 --> 06:06.462
or you're just trying
to avoid responsibility

06:06.464 --> 06:08.141
for something you've done,

06:08.453 --> 06:09.599
you can go home.

06:09.601 --> 06:10.922
What?

06:10.947 --> 06:14.110
I-I'm not trying to avoid
responsibility for anything.

06:14.336 --> 06:16.169
I'm just here to go to priest school.

06:16.374 --> 06:17.340
Preschool?

06:17.342 --> 06:18.741
Priest school.

06:18.743 --> 06:19.848
Ah, oh, yes, yeah.

06:20.412 --> 06:22.677
Yeah, we don't use that
term for that exact reason.

06:24.181 --> 06:25.448
Oh, I wish I could see

06:25.450 --> 06:27.250
the look on his face in 12 to 15 months

06:27.252 --> 06:30.920
when a judge hits him
with a $600-to-$800 fine.

06:30.922 --> 06:32.422
Wait,
$600-to-$800?

06:33.190 --> 06:34.457
That's like a pair of shoes.

06:34.459 --> 06:35.892
Maybe for you, bitch.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.494
- Paula?
- Yes?

06:38.496 --> 06:41.464
Can we take a quick time-out for
some nonjudgmental truth time?

06:41.466 --> 06:43.966
- Always.
- I just don't know about this, okay?

06:43.968 --> 06:45.601
You're working so hard,

06:45.603 --> 06:47.937
and the case is super, super clever,

06:47.939 --> 06:50.106
but... I'm just not satisfied.

06:50.108 --> 06:51.774
I-I want to do something big

06:51.776 --> 06:54.677
and now. And-and,
like, suing Josh just...

06:54.679 --> 06:56.579
It feels...

06:56.581 --> 06:59.482
Okay. You know when you eat a
whole bag of iced ginger snaps,

06:59.484 --> 07:01.250
but then you're like, "What?
There's still a hole inside me,"

07:01.252 --> 07:03.052
so then you move on to shoplifting,

07:03.054 --> 07:04.754
and the next thing you
know, you're in your dorm,

07:04.756 --> 07:06.856
surrounded by unitards and fuzzy
pillows from Urban Outfitters

07:06.858 --> 07:08.391
and the hole's still there?

07:08.393 --> 07:09.459
It feels like that.

07:09.461 --> 07:11.728
That's why you have so many unitards?

07:11.730 --> 07:13.629
I was more of a lipstick
and Sambuca shoplifter myself

07:13.631 --> 07:14.530
back in the day.

07:14.532 --> 07:15.531
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

07:15.533 --> 07:16.899
Okay, so, Paula,

07:16.901 --> 07:20.136
instead of this, can we
do something, like, savage

07:20.138 --> 07:23.506
and brutal and primal? Right? Please?

07:23.508 --> 07:24.173
No.

07:24.175 --> 07:25.408
- What?
- No way.

07:25.410 --> 07:27.710
Rebecca, we have found the perfect

07:27.712 --> 07:31.147
legal, ethical and public
way to get back at Josh.

07:31.149 --> 07:33.950
I mean, we actually
have the high ground.

07:33.952 --> 07:35.351
We never have the high ground.

07:35.353 --> 07:36.385
No, it's true.

07:36.387 --> 07:38.154
And you know I am down
for a nefarious plan

07:38.156 --> 07:39.288
as much as the next gal,

07:39.290 --> 07:42.492
but this plan is legit,

07:42.494 --> 07:44.994
and you won't get in trouble.

07:45.355 --> 07:46.996
So this case is the way to go.

07:46.998 --> 07:50.466
I promise you. This is a good thing.

07:50.468 --> 07:55.560
But I want a bad thing.

07:55.585 --> 07:57.473
This is bad. This is really bad.

07:57.475 --> 07:59.275
What the hell is wrong with me?

07:59.277 --> 08:01.144
I can't believe I showed
up to Rebecca's house

08:01.146 --> 08:04.981
with a stupid excuse, visibly
aroused in my running shorts.

08:05.816 --> 08:07.216
She got to me.

08:07.218 --> 08:09.385
Rebecca Bunch got to me.

08:09.387 --> 08:12.121
With her, "Blah, blah,
I'm sad and vulnerable."

08:12.123 --> 08:14.087
And then her now, "Blah, blah, blah,

08:14.112 --> 08:16.559
now I'm all hot and tough
with budding triceps."

08:16.561 --> 08:19.262
What, is she doing dips all of a sudden?

08:19.264 --> 08:21.864
I fall for every stupid
thing that she does.

08:21.866 --> 08:23.766
Honestly, I can't believe
I'm letting you down,

08:23.768 --> 08:26.002
the person that matters most to me.

08:27.805 --> 08:29.839
But don't worry, Captain,

08:29.974 --> 08:31.799
I'm shaking it off.

08:32.370 --> 08:34.642
Old Nathaniel's coming back.

08:35.078 --> 08:37.751
Ice-cold, in control.

08:38.416 --> 08:40.063
A real man.

08:43.419 --> 08:47.498
Guys! My avocado tree has
gone certifiably insane.

08:47.523 --> 08:48.658
Help yourselves.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.226
Guac o'clock, people.

08:50.913 --> 08:53.329
Hey, Maya, catching up
on all the best ways

08:53.331 --> 08:55.398
to get a peach-shaped booty?

08:55.400 --> 08:58.467
No, because I love myself, and
I don't purchase any periodicals

08:58.469 --> 09:00.036
which engage in body-shaming.

09:00.038 --> 09:01.704
By the way, young adult
women's periodicals

09:01.706 --> 09:05.074
are doing some of the most
relevant and honest reporting

09:05.076 --> 09:06.409
out there right now.

09:06.411 --> 09:08.845
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
- It's true.

09:08.847 --> 09:11.080
Look at this study about the orgasm gap.

09:11.082 --> 09:14.016
Did you know that studies
show women only orgasm

09:14.018 --> 09:16.118
39% of the time during sex,

09:16.120 --> 09:18.454
while men finish 91% of the time?

09:18.456 --> 09:19.655
That doesn't even make sense.

09:19.657 --> 09:22.326
People are orgasming 130% of the time?

09:23.561 --> 09:24.716
Uh, check your math.

09:24.741 --> 09:25.962
And you check your privilege.

09:25.964 --> 09:27.597
As a woman, I can tell you these studies

09:27.599 --> 09:29.398
are completely based in reality.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.833
Not my reality.

09:30.835 --> 09:32.134
I'm a king in the boudoir.

09:32.136 --> 09:35.537
Every woman I've ever had
sex with has obviously orgasmed...

09:35.562 --> 09:37.039
every time.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.441
Especially my wife.

09:38.443 --> 09:40.251
And you know that because?

09:40.276 --> 09:42.612
Because, when we're having
sex in our favorite position,

09:42.614 --> 09:44.280
I'm on top, going a mile a minute,

09:44.282 --> 09:45.715
we always gloriously finish

09:45.717 --> 09:49.008
at the exact same time, every time.

09:49.305 --> 09:52.555
Tim, you have never given
your wife an orgasm, ever,

09:52.557 --> 09:54.257
not even once.

09:58.228 --> 09:59.262
Hey, Tim,

09:59.264 --> 10:00.696
you ever have someone in your life

10:00.698 --> 10:02.098
who's trying so hard to please you,

10:02.100 --> 10:03.933
but they're just doing it wrong?

10:03.935 --> 10:06.135
And so you pretend to like
it 'cause you care about them,

10:06.137 --> 10:07.703
you really do, but, I don't know,

10:07.705 --> 10:09.939
you just kind of have
to fake being satisfied?

10:10.540 --> 10:13.643
What is happening? What have you heard?
Did you talk to my wife?

10:13.645 --> 10:15.244
What? You're being so weird.

10:15.246 --> 10:16.579
Okay, what's this meeting about anyway?

10:16.581 --> 10:18.826
Oh, my God, I'm not in the
mood for Nathaniel right now.

10:18.851 --> 10:21.017
He's been so doe-eyed
and feelingsy lately.

10:21.019 --> 10:22.318
He's like a woman or something.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.586
Shut up, stop talking.

10:23.588 --> 10:24.620
Here's the deal, losers -

10:24.622 --> 10:26.022
you know that place on East Cameron?

10:26.024 --> 10:27.990
The family Korean barbecue mom-pop?

10:27.992 --> 10:29.225
It's been there for 30 years?

10:29.227 --> 10:31.160
Oh, yeah, Chae Won's
BBQ? I love that place.

10:31.162 --> 10:32.461
Chae Won is so nice.

10:32.463 --> 10:34.030
He always gives me extra kimchi,

10:34.032 --> 10:36.632
and his adorable grandmother's
in the back making tofu soup...

10:36.634 --> 10:37.867
He's about to be obliterated.

10:37.869 --> 10:39.936
The Ivywood Mall Corp, who we represent,

10:39.938 --> 10:41.470
needs the lot that Chae Won is on.

10:41.472 --> 10:42.838
So we're gonna get that place shut down,

10:42.840 --> 10:44.006
and we're gonna get it demolished,

10:44.008 --> 10:45.274
so that our client can build

10:45.276 --> 10:47.209
their discount wicker
lacquered napkin ring,

10:47.211 --> 10:49.312
capiz shell chandelier palace.

10:49.314 --> 10:51.781
Nathaniel, we can't do
that. I mean, Chae Won...

10:51.783 --> 10:54.483
Is a loser who doesn't pay our bills.

10:57.019 --> 10:59.155
- George, what are you doing here?
- Oh, I hired him back.

10:59.157 --> 11:01.123
I need a flunky to work
full-time on assassinating

11:01.125 --> 11:02.925
the character of this Chae Won fella.

11:02.927 --> 11:04.360
George, any dirt yet?

11:04.362 --> 11:06.329
Uh, no. N-No dirt on Chae Won yet.

11:06.331 --> 11:07.697
Um...

11:07.699 --> 11:09.899
Ooh, except for the dirt
that he digs up every weekend

11:09.901 --> 11:11.634
at the community
garden for the homeless.

11:11.636 --> 11:13.669
- Awww.
- I know, right?

11:13.671 --> 11:15.204
- Oh, come on.
- Sorry.

11:15.206 --> 11:16.605
This guy grows a hobo a salad

11:16.607 --> 11:19.041
and you think he's
exempt from capitalism?

11:19.043 --> 11:20.142
What is wrong with Tim?

11:20.144 --> 11:21.510
I don't...

11:21.512 --> 11:23.105
Wake up, Tim!

11:23.681 --> 11:26.382
I told you what to do, now do it. Okay?

11:26.384 --> 11:27.683
I got to go.

11:27.685 --> 11:29.018
My neighbor's dog is barking all night.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.486
I'm gonna take that
little bitch to the vet

11:30.488 --> 11:32.391
and get its vocal cords ripped out.

11:34.414 --> 11:36.078
He's so awful.

11:36.103 --> 11:38.361
Oh, yeah, yeah, no,
he's-he's-he's terrible.

11:38.363 --> 11:40.695
He's awful. He's bad.

11:48.706 --> 11:49.939
What are you doing here?

11:49.941 --> 11:51.240
How do you know where I live?

11:51.242 --> 11:52.775
I have my ways.

11:53.443 --> 11:54.844
Company directory.

11:54.846 --> 11:56.278
Hmm. What do you want?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.481
I want your hard,
throbbing ruthlessness.

11:58.483 --> 12:00.016
And I want it bad.

12:00.018 --> 12:01.217
Who talks like that?

12:01.219 --> 12:02.485
Shut up. Listen to me.

12:02.487 --> 12:03.753
I need you.

12:03.755 --> 12:06.389
Because you are the worst
person I've ever met.

12:06.391 --> 12:09.025
Clearly you didn't summer 
in the Hamptons.

12:09.027 --> 12:10.393
Ha, ha, ha. But seriously.

12:10.395 --> 12:12.628
You're an amoral sociopath
with no conscience,

12:12.630 --> 12:14.630
and I need someone to help me

12:14.632 --> 12:17.600
destroy Josh Chan,
who is an evil genius,

12:17.602 --> 12:19.635
a monster, a dead-eyed fiend.

12:19.637 --> 12:20.736
You, so...

12:20.738 --> 12:22.338
what do you say?

12:22.340 --> 12:25.198
I say get out of my apartment.

12:30.526 --> 12:32.963
Rebecca, I'm not getting
pulled into your drama,

12:32.988 --> 12:34.229
no matter what you say.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.104
No, no, no. Listen. You
really don't understand.

12:36.178 --> 12:38.278
Okay, I-I seriously need you.

12:38.303 --> 12:40.270
I've been trying to come
up with evil schemes,

12:40.295 --> 12:41.813
but they just come up,
like, lame and childish.

12:41.838 --> 12:42.940
Of course they do.

12:42.965 --> 12:45.299
Why do you think I hired
George to get rid of Chae Won?

12:45.389 --> 12:48.590
Huh? Because you have the
heart of a weak, dying kitten.

12:48.592 --> 12:49.725
Exactly, that's what's
getting in my way,

12:49.727 --> 12:51.739
and that is why I need you.

12:51.764 --> 12:52.943
Listen.

12:52.968 --> 12:54.268
Nathaniel.

12:54.669 --> 12:56.164
I know you want me.

12:56.739 --> 12:58.560
And I've been making you wait for it.

12:59.436 --> 13:00.869
But not anymore.

13:00.871 --> 13:02.489
- I said you need to...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

13:02.514 --> 13:04.573

15:32.769 --> 15:35.574
I will let you do
anything you want to me.

15:35.959 --> 15:37.659
And I mean anything.

15:37.661 --> 15:39.327
Yes, that.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.965
That.

15:41.895 --> 15:43.928
You're telling me you
don't want to do that?

15:48.902 --> 15:50.739
It's a challenging program, yes.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.575
But in four to six years,
I'll have my master's,

15:53.577 --> 15:55.777
and then there's the
postgraduate internship,

15:55.779 --> 15:57.946
the Alaskan mission
where I shadow a priest

15:57.948 --> 15:59.581
in a small fishing village.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.784
I'm already taking a super
fun pre-theology class.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.322
I think there's a few months
of silent prayer in there.

16:06.690 --> 16:08.557
Wow.

16:08.559 --> 16:10.018
You hate this.

16:10.043 --> 16:12.237
No, I don't. I don't.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.528
Bro, come on. What are you doing?

16:13.530 --> 16:15.664
Just come home. This is ridiculous.

16:15.666 --> 16:16.865
He's right. This is ridiculous.

16:16.867 --> 16:19.101
So, what? Did you guys
drive all the way up here

16:19.103 --> 16:20.969
just to be, like, all critical?

16:20.971 --> 16:24.039
No. We came up here because
no one has heard from you

16:24.041 --> 16:25.741
since you bailed on your wedding.

16:25.743 --> 16:29.144
Yeah, it's been weeks, and not a
single Instagram Story from you.

16:29.146 --> 16:30.579
It's unprecedented.

16:30.581 --> 16:34.516
You just... Father, Son and
Holy Ghosted your entire life.

16:34.518 --> 16:35.684
That was good.

16:35.686 --> 16:37.219
Yeah, yeah.

16:37.785 --> 16:39.831
Look, I know things must
be rough with Rebecca.

16:39.856 --> 16:41.822
I mean, w-what did she
say when you talked to her?

16:45.862 --> 16:48.530
Oh, you haven't... you
haven't talked to her?

16:48.532 --> 16:50.732
- At all?
- I know. I know!

16:50.734 --> 16:52.367
Ugh! It's so bad.

16:52.369 --> 16:54.312
Okay, I've had an apology e-mail
to her in my drafts for weeks.

16:54.337 --> 16:55.781
- Oh. No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.739
No, I swear, I swear.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.173
- Come on.
- But what do I say?

16:58.175 --> 16:59.975
"Sorry for bailing on you
because I'm not even sure

16:59.977 --> 17:01.266
we know each other well enough"?

17:01.291 --> 17:03.378
Uh, yeah. Exactly that,
except not in an e-mail.

17:03.380 --> 17:05.247
What matters here is that you
have to have that conversation

17:05.249 --> 17:06.915
with her
face-to-face.

17:06.916 --> 17:09.017
Seriously. I mean, are you
really gonna become a priest

17:09.019 --> 17:11.569
just because you don't want to
have an awkward conversation?

17:11.595 --> 17:15.857
No. I-I'm becoming a priest
because I'm a good person

17:15.858 --> 17:18.693
who thrives in an academic setting.

17:18.867 --> 17:19.936
Josh.

17:19.962 --> 17:22.406
And because I want to stay here.

17:22.705 --> 17:24.390
I like it here a lot.

17:25.598 --> 17:27.633
I think I'll major in Christmas.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.371
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

17:29.373 --> 17:30.739
Okay, Tim.

17:30.741 --> 17:32.941
- We're gonna go over this again.
- Oh, my God...

17:32.966 --> 17:36.160
This is the area that you
need to pay attention to.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.146
I know what that part is,

17:38.148 --> 17:40.382
but that's not actually
the important part.

17:40.384 --> 17:43.585
The important part isn't
even on your stupid diagram.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.188
You guys know what I'm talking about.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.257
It's not on the outside,
it's on the inside.

17:50.259 --> 17:52.194
The G-spot, guys.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.029
The G-spot. You just go in,

17:54.031 --> 17:56.097
in, in, in,

17:56.099 --> 17:58.699
up, up, up, and then back, back, back.

17:58.724 --> 18:01.175
That's the spot. That
does it every time.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.371
Oh, co... okay. All right.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.806
I know what you guys are trying to do.

18:04.808 --> 18:06.174
You guys are trying
to shake my confidence.

18:06.176 --> 18:08.076
You know what? I'll admit,

18:08.078 --> 18:10.645
it almost worked. Yesterday,
you had me a little rattled,

18:10.647 --> 18:14.883
but then, I went home and
I had marital relations,

18:15.001 --> 18:18.987
and my wife was very satisfied
by my foolproof method,

18:18.989 --> 18:21.289
which, again, is... in, in, in...

18:21.291 --> 18:22.357
- Tim.
- Uh... what?

18:22.359 --> 18:23.859
Look at this scientific study.

18:23.861 --> 18:26.194
70 to 80% of women

18:26.196 --> 18:30.165
only achieve orgasm from direct
stimulation of the clitoris.

18:30.167 --> 18:32.267
It's the anatomical source

18:32.269 --> 18:34.135
of basically all female pleasure.

18:34.137 --> 18:35.904
It has 8,000 nerve endings.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.406
A penis only has 4,000.

18:37.431 --> 18:39.708
Guys, my wife is satisfied.

18:39.710 --> 18:42.377
After we make love, she is very happy.

18:42.379 --> 18:44.613
She pops right up, she
goes into the bathroom,

18:44.615 --> 18:45.780
she brushes her teeth...

18:45.782 --> 18:47.148
- Brushes her teeth?
- Yes.

18:47.150 --> 18:49.484
I can hear the buzzing sound
of her electric toothbrush.

18:49.486 --> 18:51.114
She really loves that thing.

18:51.139 --> 18:54.055
You can hear her moaning when
she gets a good patch of plaque.

18:54.057 --> 18:56.524
Then a lot of moaning
right towards the very end,

18:56.526 --> 18:58.200
and then she switches it off,

18:58.225 --> 19:00.562
and walks back in, all
happy and glowing...

19:00.564 --> 19:02.497
Sounds like quite the toothbrush.

19:02.499 --> 19:04.232
Sounds like a vibrator.

19:07.236 --> 19:08.603
Oh, my God.

19:17.992 --> 19:20.293
Hey, George, do you
know where Nathaniel is?

19:20.295 --> 19:21.597
Uh, no. No, he hasn't

19:21.622 --> 19:22.857
come in. I have to go though.

19:22.882 --> 19:25.804
I have to go plant dead rats
in Chae Won's kitchen

19:25.829 --> 19:27.898
while he's out describing
paintings to the blind.

19:27.930 --> 19:30.564
- Oh, my God, he's the best.
- He really is.

19:30.566 --> 19:32.285
God, it's so weird that
Nathaniel's not here.

19:32.310 --> 19:34.201
I mean, I made him a
proposal on a very enticing

19:34.203 --> 19:35.702
piece of business. I mean,

19:35.704 --> 19:37.638
it's a really enticing
piece of business.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.939
It's smoking, if you ask me.

19:38.941 --> 19:40.073
It's been doing tricep dips.

19:40.075 --> 19:42.609
Anyway, he hasn't gotten back to me.

19:43.793 --> 19:45.312
I don't know what you're saying.

19:45.314 --> 19:46.547
That's fair.

19:46.549 --> 19:48.515
I'm sorr...

19:59.294 --> 20:00.895
For moi?

20:01.630 --> 20:03.397
Okay.

20:04.699 --> 20:06.130
What?

20:08.982 --> 20:10.337
_

20:10.339 --> 20:12.076
Yes.

20:13.019 --> 20:14.852
Oh, my God.

20:14.877 --> 20:16.310
"Proposal accepted.

20:16.312 --> 20:18.645
Meet me tomorrow night on the noof."

20:18.647 --> 20:19.980
The "noof"?

20:19.982 --> 20:21.148
The "roof."

20:21.150 --> 20:23.951
God, calligraphy is so confusing.

20:25.087 --> 20:28.021
What are you?

20:30.092 --> 20:31.725
Mm.

20:31.727 --> 20:33.727
Whoa.

20:35.063 --> 20:38.265
Ah...

20:42.071 --> 20:43.604
Ooh.

20:43.606 --> 20:46.006
Oh, my God.

20:46.008 --> 20:48.075
Mm, very sexy.

20:48.077 --> 20:52.317
Why is everyone in this office
always talking about sex?

21:12.533 --> 21:15.102
Wow, you look go...

21:15.104 --> 21:16.980
wait a minute, where's
the dress I bought you?

21:17.005 --> 21:20.107
Oh, right, yes. I donated that to the
West Covina Middle School

21:20.109 --> 21:22.476
Drama Department because
only a 13-year-old girl

21:22.478 --> 21:23.644
could fit into it.

21:23.646 --> 21:27.064
Well, you do have an
unconventional body type.

21:27.089 --> 21:28.849
Yeah, also, we're not even gonna discuss

21:28.851 --> 21:29.917
the lingerie you gave me.

21:29.919 --> 21:32.119
Uh, the bra was like
two delicate tissues

21:32.121 --> 21:33.420
held together with floss

21:33.422 --> 21:36.556
and the panties sliced my
muffin top into a hamburger bun.

21:36.558 --> 21:38.278
Wow. A lot of feedback here.

21:38.567 --> 21:39.726
Sorry, I'll be sexy again.

21:39.728 --> 21:41.628
Anyway, um, so where are
we going? What's the plan?

21:41.630 --> 21:44.700
Well, I will tell you when we get there.

21:44.725 --> 21:47.395
Oh, good. I love secrets.

21:47.836 --> 21:51.171
Hey, um, why did you change your mind?

21:53.074 --> 21:55.509
The sex, you know.

21:55.511 --> 21:57.311
It's just a simple transaction for me.

21:57.313 --> 21:59.022
Oh.
Uh-uh-uh.

21:59.373 --> 22:01.178
Not until the deal is done.

22:02.017 --> 22:04.518
I watched Cruel Intentions in
the car on the way over here.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.119
Oh, that is such a good movie.

22:08.157 --> 22:10.757
What? Oh, no, my dry-bar uptini!

22:10.759 --> 22:12.025
It's a helicopter!

22:12.027 --> 22:13.193
Yeah, no, I get that!

22:15.064 --> 22:17.664
- Just get over here, get over here.
- Oh, okay.

22:17.666 --> 22:20.767
This is so sexy!

22:20.769 --> 22:23.003
Just land it!

22:23.005 --> 22:25.572
Just land the damn helicopter!

22:27.576 --> 22:29.876
Oh, what is this place?

22:29.878 --> 22:31.411
Well, usually,

22:31.413 --> 22:33.747
it's a spin-lates gym, but tonight...

22:34.118 --> 22:35.716
it's something extra special.

22:35.718 --> 22:37.084
Ooh.

22:37.086 --> 22:38.552
What's that?

22:38.554 --> 22:40.387
Did I mention?

22:40.389 --> 22:42.438
This party is a masquerade.

22:43.725 --> 22:44.992
No!

22:44.994 --> 22:46.693
You didn't mention that!

22:46.695 --> 22:47.894
I would've remembered
if you'd mentioned that.

22:47.896 --> 22:49.730
Oh, my God, this is so fun.

22:49.732 --> 22:51.221
Ooh, can I be the tiger?
Can I please be the tiger?

22:51.246 --> 22:54.346
- You need to shh.
- Sorry. Sorry.

22:56.067 --> 22:59.402
I get to be the tiger.

23:01.009 --> 23:04.811
Behind this curtain are
the most powerful people

23:04.813 --> 23:08.281
east of the 5, north of the
10 and some parts of the 2.

23:08.283 --> 23:09.916
So, South Pasadena, basically?

23:09.918 --> 23:11.251
Yeah, more or less.

23:11.253 --> 23:13.587
Craig lives in La Cañada
Flintridge, but it's close.

23:15.747 --> 23:18.725
- Shall we?
- Ooh.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.970
Four people in this
room have the ability

23:29.972 --> 23:32.188
to ruin Josh Chan's life forever.

23:32.841 --> 23:35.142
And one can just make it super annoying,

23:35.144 --> 23:36.476
so we'll skip him.

23:36.478 --> 23:40.813
Now, it's time to destroy Josh Chan.

24:00.438 --> 24:01.758
Dear God,

24:02.250 --> 24:04.184
I have to read all this
religion and Bible stuff,

24:04.186 --> 24:06.086
and I don't understand any of it,

24:06.088 --> 24:07.804
and it doesn't interest me at all.

24:08.056 --> 24:09.929
No offense, Big Guy.

24:10.101 --> 24:12.225
So, when I open my eyes,

24:12.227 --> 24:14.194
can I just be a priest, and look cool,

24:14.196 --> 24:15.929
and hand out wine and wafers,

24:15.931 --> 24:19.750
and not at all feel bad about
leaving Rebecca at the altar?

24:23.872 --> 24:25.171
I knew that wasn't gonna work.

24:25.173 --> 24:26.406
I'm not Aladdin.

24:28.281 --> 24:31.478
I just thought it was
gonna feel so satisfying,

24:31.480 --> 24:33.446
but it doesn't at all.

24:35.703 --> 24:37.610
Just feel like I'm faking it.

24:41.389 --> 24:43.022
Just feel like I'm faking it.

24:43.024 --> 24:45.592
Tim, you have never 
given your wife an orgasm.

24:45.594 --> 24:47.460
Fake being satisfied?

24:47.462 --> 24:48.978
Sounds like a vibrator.

24:49.003 --> 24:50.296
You're doing it wrong.

24:50.298 --> 24:51.898
39% of the time...

27:37.265 --> 27:38.431
We split up.

27:38.433 --> 27:40.833
Your job is critical. You see those

27:40.835 --> 27:42.602
- three women over there?
- Uh-huh.

27:42.604 --> 27:44.604
I need you to distract them
while I talk to their husbands.

27:44.606 --> 27:46.873
You can talk to them about
anything, anything at all,

27:46.875 --> 27:49.842
except for raising taxes,
charter school vouchers

27:49.844 --> 27:51.261
and being pro-choice.

27:51.819 --> 27:53.394
Can you do that?

27:54.649 --> 27:57.800
- Absolutely. No problem.
- Good.

28:01.789 --> 28:03.256
Mmm, I love this champagne.

28:03.258 --> 28:04.991
The level of carbonation is just right.

28:04.993 --> 28:08.127
Mm, well is it champagne
or sparkling wine?

28:08.129 --> 28:09.429
I never know.

28:09.431 --> 28:10.530
Oh.

28:10.532 --> 28:11.965
One of life's great mysteries,

28:11.967 --> 28:13.766
like how to fix public education.

28:13.768 --> 28:15.068
Actually, it's not a mystery.

28:15.070 --> 28:16.436
You just adequately
fund school districts

28:16.438 --> 28:17.770
irrespective of their tax base.

28:18.842 --> 28:22.842
Kidding. Uh, vouchers are the
only way to go, am I right?

28:22.844 --> 28:24.344
Mm.

28:25.909 --> 28:27.547
Mmm, this Brie is divine.

28:27.549 --> 28:28.681
I know.

28:28.683 --> 28:30.583
Soft cheeses are like crack to me.

28:30.585 --> 28:33.019
Crack, yeah. Crack, that is...

28:33.021 --> 28:34.654
a funny thing to make a joke about

28:34.656 --> 28:36.522
because it is not at all a cheap drug

28:36.524 --> 28:38.691
disseminated by the CIA during
the Reagan administration

28:38.693 --> 28:40.159
to decimate our inner cities.

28:40.161 --> 28:42.295
Damn it, I mean, uh,

28:42.297 --> 28:45.531
Nancy Reagan was a national
hero and a style icon, right?

28:50.081 --> 28:51.681
You are absolutely right.

28:51.706 --> 28:54.941
Uh, Roe v. Wade is nothing
short of judicial activism.

28:54.943 --> 28:56.009
Oh, thank God.

28:56.011 --> 28:57.744
Oh, my God, I was about to tell her that

28:57.746 --> 28:59.879
states should be free to
make individual choices,

28:59.881 --> 29:01.047
but reproductive rights...

29:01.708 --> 29:03.950
You performed flawlessly.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.518
The table is set for our plan.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.779
Oh.

29:07.222 --> 29:11.037
- What do we do now?
- Now... we dance.

29:15.139 --> 29:16.907
Is this part of the plan?

29:17.065 --> 29:18.965
No, I just wanted to dance.

29:18.967 --> 29:20.299
Oh.

29:25.439 --> 29:27.774
Nathaniel, why are you
doing all this for me really?

29:28.959 --> 29:30.803
Honestly, I don't know. I...

29:31.446 --> 29:33.780
When I'm around you, I
stop thinking about myself

29:33.782 --> 29:35.181
and I think about you.

29:36.323 --> 29:37.583
It's very confusing.

29:39.154 --> 29:41.821
Wow, that's... for you,
that's not confusing.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.256
That's-that's like a miracle.

30:02.043 --> 30:04.077
Rebecca, it's done. We did it.

30:04.079 --> 30:05.411
Done? What do you mean?

30:05.413 --> 30:08.815
We just ruined Josh Chan's
life for good, the two of us.

30:08.817 --> 30:11.184
We're unstoppable.

30:14.489 --> 30:16.322
Let's get out of here.

30:16.324 --> 30:17.557
Uh-huh.

30:25.066 --> 30:27.633
Hey, you don't have
to do this, you know,

30:27.822 --> 30:29.997
regardless of our deal.

30:30.238 --> 30:32.438
I want to.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.107
I've always wanted to.

30:53.289 --> 30:55.657
Well, that was actually very satisfying.

30:55.659 --> 30:57.158
Isn't it always?

30:57.160 --> 30:58.693
Only 39% of the time.

30:58.695 --> 31:00.328
There's some interesting
literature on the subject,

31:00.330 --> 31:02.764
but, Nathaniel, tell me,
what did we do to Josh?

31:02.766 --> 31:04.532
Mm, you sure you want to know?

31:04.534 --> 31:06.201
I don't want to corrupt
your innocent soul.

31:06.203 --> 31:08.937
Mm, no, no, no, tell me, please.

31:08.939 --> 31:10.632
Well, okay.

31:11.671 --> 31:13.283
You said you wanted
to ruin him, right?

31:13.308 --> 31:14.168
Uh-huh.

31:14.193 --> 31:16.745
Well, to ruin a man, you have
to go after what he loves most.

31:16.747 --> 31:18.446
Video games.

31:19.328 --> 31:22.450
- Not that. Okay.
- He cares about family.

31:22.452 --> 31:24.119
Family.

31:24.121 --> 31:25.420
Okay.

31:25.422 --> 31:26.988
So that's what we went after.

31:26.990 --> 31:29.023
We went after Josh's family?

31:29.025 --> 31:30.125
Oh, okay.

31:30.127 --> 31:32.082
First, Josh's sister, Jastenity,

31:32.107 --> 31:34.562
she's about to be accused of plagiarism

31:34.564 --> 31:37.132
and kicked out of Cal State Northridge.

31:37.134 --> 31:38.633
Oh...

31:38.635 --> 31:39.901
Oh, really? That's a bummer.

31:39.903 --> 31:41.269
'Cause she just got on the dean's list.

31:41.271 --> 31:42.771
Not as much of a bummer
as what's gonna happen

31:42.773 --> 31:43.772
to Josh's father.

31:43.774 --> 31:45.940
- Oh... uh, Joseph?
- Joseph.

31:45.942 --> 31:49.577
He is about to be audited
for financial malfeasance

31:49.579 --> 31:50.912
at his radiology lab.

31:50.914 --> 31:52.247
There's gonna be criminal charges.

31:52.249 --> 31:54.282
And once that happens, he'll be a felon,

31:54.284 --> 31:56.417
and his permanent resident
status will be revoked.

31:56.419 --> 31:58.586
- Oh, my God!
- And that's not all.

31:58.588 --> 31:59.888
I'm saving the very best for last.

31:59.890 --> 32:02.190
Josh's grandfather is about
to draw his last breath.

32:02.192 --> 32:03.491
His lolo? What do you mean?

32:03.493 --> 32:06.027
One of the men at the party
owns a chain of hospices.

32:06.029 --> 32:09.297
We have direct access to
Lolo and his oxygen tank.

32:09.299 --> 32:11.434
You're gonna kill Josh's lolo?!

32:17.426 --> 32:20.842
Eat it, zombies.

32:20.844 --> 32:23.211
No one can rise from the dead.

32:23.213 --> 32:24.512
It's stupid.

32:24.514 --> 32:25.713
Josh?

32:25.715 --> 32:28.449
Uh, Father, um... sorry.

32:28.451 --> 32:29.584
Um, I'm sorry.

32:29.586 --> 32:31.986
Uh, obviously, you know, Jesus can

32:31.988 --> 32:35.824
and-and-and-and
did, and will again

32:35.826 --> 32:37.292
rise from the dead.

32:37.658 --> 32:39.260
Right? Huh?

32:39.262 --> 32:42.130
Son, is everything okay?

32:42.861 --> 32:44.933
Did you talk to God?

32:44.935 --> 32:46.334
I talked to Him earlier

32:46.336 --> 32:47.836
and asked Him not to say anything,

32:47.838 --> 32:49.404
but I thought He might blab.

32:49.406 --> 32:51.105
No, you just seemed upset,

32:51.107 --> 32:53.007
so I was expressing concern.

32:53.508 --> 32:56.044
Anyway, I have noticed you seeming torn

32:56.046 --> 32:57.645
about your decision to come here,

32:57.647 --> 33:00.758
so I decided to come by
with a special treat for you.

33:00.883 --> 33:03.384
- Jelly beans?
- No.

33:03.386 --> 33:05.186
At the service today,

33:05.188 --> 33:08.289
I thought you might want to
pass the collection basket.

33:08.291 --> 33:11.823
Are there no openings
in wine and wafers?

33:11.848 --> 33:13.795
No. It's basket of nothing.

33:13.797 --> 33:17.966
Okay. I do have a cool
suit from my almost-wedding.

33:17.968 --> 33:19.400
Can I wear that?

33:19.402 --> 33:22.237
Okay, buddy, I'm gonna
say yes to that one.

33:22.239 --> 33:23.614
Cool.

33:24.140 --> 33:26.007
Geez, this frickin' guy.

33:27.443 --> 33:29.043
Oh, my God, undo it, undo it,

33:29.045 --> 33:30.979
- just, right now!
- Fine, I'll undo it.

33:30.981 --> 33:33.514
But you said you wanted
me to do evil things.

33:33.516 --> 33:34.849
That's what I did.

33:34.851 --> 33:36.451
I-I thought that's what
you said you wanted.

33:36.453 --> 33:38.186
Yes, I... No. I don't know.

33:38.188 --> 33:40.989
I don't know, I don't
know. Nothing feels right.

33:40.991 --> 33:42.490
I've tried everything.
I've tried mailing poop,

33:42.492 --> 33:44.726
I've tried the fake sex tape,
I've tried Paul's lawsuit idea.

33:44.728 --> 33:46.822
Stop, go back. You tried mailing what?

33:46.847 --> 33:49.931
But just none of it is
helping me feel better.

33:49.933 --> 33:51.714
And your plan...

33:52.608 --> 33:54.008
I'm sorry, it's awful.

33:54.104 --> 33:55.904
Well, so picky.

33:55.906 --> 33:58.206
Sounds like you don't like
anyone's porridge, Goldilocks.

33:58.208 --> 34:00.041
Why doesn't anybody
understand what I really want?

34:00.043 --> 34:01.209
Well, what do you really want?

34:01.211 --> 34:03.464
I want him to face what he did to me.

34:06.105 --> 34:07.925
He left me at my wedding.

34:08.855 --> 34:11.152
He just left me, he left me
like a fool standing there

34:11.154 --> 34:13.987
in that... in that big, stupid waste

34:13.989 --> 34:15.556
of an expensive wedding dress.

34:15.558 --> 34:17.091
And he didn't even let me confront him

34:17.092 --> 34:18.458
in front of everyone.

34:18.460 --> 34:20.722
He didn't let me embarrass
him the way he embarrassed me.

34:21.464 --> 34:23.034
He robbed me of that moment.

34:23.150 --> 34:24.482
Well, what would that have done?

34:24.972 --> 34:27.068
That would have just made
things even more humiliating.

34:27.070 --> 34:28.902
It would have made me feel good.

34:32.150 --> 34:33.708
Wow, I'm so sorry.

34:33.710 --> 34:34.976
I'm really sorry about all this.

34:34.978 --> 34:36.244
You did all this for nothing.

34:37.130 --> 34:38.341
Um...

34:39.060 --> 34:40.529
I got to go.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.974
Oh, my God, I'm so
embarrassed... I got to go.

35:10.194 --> 35:12.983
- _
- Josh didn't even get the poop?!

35:30.332 --> 35:32.066
Thank you, my son.

35:32.068 --> 35:34.068
Easy with the "my sons," my son.

35:35.062 --> 35:36.367
Oh. Roger, Father.

35:53.688 --> 35:55.488
Paula.

35:55.490 --> 35:57.157
Oh, no. What?

35:57.159 --> 35:59.225
I am so happy that I ran into you.

35:59.227 --> 36:00.827
I have been dying to thank you.

36:00.829 --> 36:01.928
Thank me for what?

36:01.930 --> 36:04.964
My beloved and I had the best night

36:04.966 --> 36:06.166
of our 11-year marriage.

36:06.168 --> 36:08.535
She had a very satisfactory climax,

36:08.537 --> 36:11.004
and it's all thanks to
the women in the office,

36:11.006 --> 36:12.172
including you.

36:12.400 --> 36:16.766
- What are you talking about?
- Your cutting comment about

36:16.791 --> 36:18.939
me never giving my wife an orgasm.

36:19.384 --> 36:21.446
It changed my whole life.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.071
Huh. I don't remember saying that, but,

36:23.073 --> 36:25.006
you know, if I tossed out a mean comment

36:25.008 --> 36:26.806
that changed your life,
you wouldn't be the first.

36:27.462 --> 36:30.478
And by the way, if
your wife never told you

36:30.480 --> 36:32.780
she was not getting off in 11 years,

36:32.782 --> 36:33.853
that is on her.

36:33.878 --> 36:35.603
I mean, clearly, you two have

36:35.628 --> 36:38.252
a giant communication
gap that really speaks to

36:38.254 --> 36:40.845
some very deep problems
in your relationship.

36:43.181 --> 36:45.884
Anyway, working on a case...
Big game-changer, so...

36:46.617 --> 36:47.916
see you later.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.864
Oh.

36:56.370 --> 36:58.430
Bye, Tim. Happy Sunday.

37:03.322 --> 37:06.524
Rebecca, what are you doing here?

37:06.683 --> 37:08.337
Why are you wearing that?

37:08.362 --> 37:09.595
Oh...

37:09.620 --> 37:11.552
Oh, you don't like the sight of this?

37:11.554 --> 37:13.688
Huh? Thought you'd get
to go your whole life

37:13.690 --> 37:15.368
without seeing this?

37:16.212 --> 37:17.558
Good morrow, congregants.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.376
Sorry to interrupt. I'm Rebecca Bunch,

37:19.401 --> 37:21.195
and I'm here because I need to confront

37:21.197 --> 37:24.799
my ex-fiancé, who
jilted me at the altar

37:24.801 --> 37:27.034
seconds before our
wedding two weeks ago.

37:27.036 --> 37:29.036
Rebecca, let's go outside and talk.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.571
I-I'm sorry, Father Rodrigo.

37:30.573 --> 37:32.518
Wow!

37:32.940 --> 37:35.309
Wow, you're apologizing to him. To him!

37:35.311 --> 37:36.956
And, no, I will not go outside and talk.

37:37.042 --> 37:40.376
I want everyone to hear
what a fraud you are.

37:40.378 --> 37:41.945
Y-You're right to be mad at me.

37:41.947 --> 37:43.379
I-I should have reached out to you,

37:43.381 --> 37:45.748
- but God had called me.
- Josh,

37:45.750 --> 37:47.584
God did not reach out to you.

37:47.586 --> 37:50.119
You're hiding,

37:50.121 --> 37:51.834
because you're a coward.

37:52.592 --> 37:54.490
It's been two weeks, Josh.

37:54.492 --> 37:57.093
I have been waiting for anything...

37:57.506 --> 37:59.929
A text, an e-mail, a phone call...

37:59.931 --> 38:02.165
And I've... I've heard nothing.

38:02.167 --> 38:04.000
Yes, you're right. I-I
should have e-mailed.

38:04.002 --> 38:06.069
I-I have a draft. I can pull it up.

38:06.071 --> 38:08.014
Miss, we're in the
middle of a service.

38:08.039 --> 38:10.740
Father, do you know
what this person did to me?

38:10.742 --> 38:13.092
- We really don't want to know.
- We want to know.

38:13.616 --> 38:16.746
Great, great. 'Cause you're gonna know

38:16.748 --> 38:19.215
all of the terrible things he did to me,

38:19.217 --> 38:21.751
and all the terrible
things he made me do.

38:21.753 --> 38:24.120
I never made you do anything.

38:24.122 --> 38:25.622
Oh, yes, you did.

38:26.262 --> 38:30.183
With every twinkly smile,
every kind compliment,

38:30.786 --> 38:33.065
every little love kernel.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.465
And that's why I did
all the things I did.

38:35.848 --> 38:37.293
I had to do them.

38:38.178 --> 38:39.519
