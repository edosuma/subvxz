01:19.204 --> 01:20.581
Jesus!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.669
Are you still there?

01:25.752 --> 01:27.129
No, I'm back.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.090
I'm not sure I got the spelling.

01:30.174 --> 01:34.052
It is a "Y" Okay, great.
Yes, thank you. Bye.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.524
Honey, you there?
Pick up, pick up.

01:47.608 --> 01:51.653
You're not there. Okay.
Look, it's a little after 6:00.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.489
I'll catch a ride
and see you out there. Bye.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.787
- Jack.
- Yeah?

02:00.829 --> 02:05.250
The Balkans peace council is "comprised"
or "composed" of ten members?

02:05.334 --> 02:06.793
Twelve members.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.794
Oh, right. Thanks.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.715
Composed.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.218
What?

02:16.470 --> 02:19.890
A three-block area
has been evacuated.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.935
You might wanna avoid that route
coming home from work.

02:59.805 --> 03:03.517
- What do you think, Cy?
- This'll make them sweat. It's good.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.228
- I'll lead with it.
- Great. I'll see you Monday.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.105
What?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.440
- I gotta go.
- Come on, John.

03:10.524 --> 03:15.445
It'll look bad, my star reporter
not showing up at the Christmas party.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.409
I can't.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.411
Mary's waiting for me.

04:16.714 --> 04:20.511
It's a big house, isn't it?
It's a steal at this price.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.971
That's if you want it.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.474
But we're gonna have to
make an offer today.

04:25.557 --> 04:28.435
The owner's highly motivated.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.063
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.357
Take a look around.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.359
Okay.
Thank you, Brian.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.902
Thank you very much.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.159
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.832
My God.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.547
Here you are.

05:38.630 --> 05:42.050
We were just making sure
there was adequate closet space.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.719
Good. Good.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.346
Well, this house is yours
if you want it...

05:46.430 --> 05:48.932
but you have to
decide right now.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.517
We'll take it.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.061
Really? Oh, my God!

06:29.765 --> 06:32.684
You know what I kept thinking
when we were looking at that house?

06:32.768 --> 06:35.687
That we should get
a mattress for that closet.

06:41.485 --> 06:44.988
I kept thinking that
it felt like a dream come true.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.248
Come here.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.590
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.

07:03.674 --> 07:04.758
Let's see.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.927
Okay.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.273
- We bought a really, really...
- Excuse me. We bought a house.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.400
We bought a big house.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.056
Mary.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.982
Mary, are you all right?
Mary, talk to me.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.442
Are you okay?

08:06.695 --> 08:09.281
Can you hear me?
Jesus Christ!

08:11.950 --> 08:13.744
Hold on, darling.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.664
911, there's been an accident.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.166
Yes.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.733
Nothing.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.157
You okay?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.410
Yeah.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.498
All right.
It's all right.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.630
It's all right.
It's just me.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.680
You didn't see it, did you?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.559
See what?

09:22.646 --> 09:24.273
What did you see?

09:28.694 --> 09:30.654
I didn't see anything.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.831
There's something wrong with me.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.218
It's called a glioblastoma.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.763
It's a temporal lobe tumor.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.308
According to the doctor,
it's extremely rare.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.435
One in...

10:43.519 --> 10:45.521
600,000 gets this thing.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.482
Did they say it was
a result of the accident?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.110
No, it turns out...

10:52.194 --> 10:54.112
that it's been there a while.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.617
There's nothing else they can do?

11:00.118 --> 11:03.413
They did the surgery, and they
couldn't get it all out, so they'll...

11:04.831 --> 11:06.834
keep her on the chemo...

11:06.917 --> 11:09.378
as long as her strength holds out.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.550
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.511
Good.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.929
That's good.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.433
Two weeks ago...

11:23.517 --> 11:25.435
we were house hunting.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.403
One day you're just
driving along in your car...

11:34.486 --> 11:36.780
and the universe...

11:36.822 --> 11:38.949
just points at you and says...

11:39.032 --> 11:43.078
"Ah, there you are,
a happy couple.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.581
I've been looking for you.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.834
I've been looking for you".

11:52.588 --> 11:54.089
I'm sorry.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.842
For what?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.848
For all of this.

12:06.435 --> 12:09.396
I feel like
I ruined everything.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.534
You didn't ruin anything.

12:23.619 --> 12:25.537
Not a damn thing.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.709
I want you to be happy.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.450
You didn't see it, did you?

14:39.087 --> 14:40.506
Yes.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.802
Yeah?

16:08.886 --> 16:10.095
She knew.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.600
What?

16:15.392 --> 16:18.353
She was drawing angels.

17:25.963 --> 17:29.883
It was the meanness
of the campaigns...

17:29.967 --> 17:33.720
the almost complete lack
of candor and honesty...

17:33.804 --> 17:35.722
that turned the voters off..

17:38.684 --> 17:41.395
I think that these parties
are demonizing each other.

17:42.563 --> 17:46.149
They're projecting our own
personal fears and anxieties...

17:46.233 --> 17:48.151
onto the national stage.

17:48.235 --> 17:52.865
People don't like it. People are
very, very unsatisfied at the moment.

17:52.948 --> 17:56.910
It makes them complacent because they
don't see any possibility of change.

17:57.035 --> 18:01.164
2004... Is there a dark horse candidate
out there for the Democrats?

18:01.290 --> 18:03.584
Well, I'm hearing a lot
about Russ McCallum.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.086
- Governor of Virginia.
- Yeah, he might do what Carter...

18:10.257 --> 18:12.843
Hey, I told her to watch.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.219
Who?

18:14.303 --> 18:15.762
Peter's friend Gwen.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.640
She'll be there tonight.

18:18.682 --> 18:22.978
Oh, God. Look, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make that one tonight.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.564
Come on, you can't keep
blowing this thing off.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.941
I'm not. I've got an interview
with the governor.

18:28.025 --> 18:30.611
I gotta be in Richmond
at 8:00 in the morning.

18:33.113 --> 18:36.533
I almost forgot.
McCallum's office called.

18:36.617 --> 18:39.077
They bumped the meeting
till tomorrow night.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.418
Eddie, look, I...

18:46.502 --> 18:47.419
Look...

18:49.254 --> 18:51.340
she's not Mary.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.050
Not by a mile.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.719
But you know what?

18:57.179 --> 18:59.097
No one ever will be.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.057
Hey, Ed.
I'm sorry about today.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.728
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.

19:46.812 --> 19:49.189
Maybe some other time.

19:49.273 --> 19:51.316
It's about 1:00 in the morning.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.236
I'm a little wired,
so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.071
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.084
Al I right, come on.

22:14.585 --> 22:18.589
Hi. I'm sorry. I know it's really late,
but my car broke down just up the road.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.216
I wondered if I could
use the phone.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.718
Hello.

22:24.428 --> 22:25.846
It's him.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.310
I been waitin' for you.

22:32.311 --> 22:34.980
You son of a bitch.
What are you doin'?

22:35.063 --> 22:37.149
Get the door! Get the door!

22:39.109 --> 22:40.611
Just stay right there.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.823
Mister, I don't know who you...

22:44.907 --> 22:45.824
Shut up!

22:47.451 --> 22:48.869
Shut up.

22:51.455 --> 22:53.790
Honey, Connie's here.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.628
Well, hey, Gordon.
How you doin'?

22:59.588 --> 23:02.049
Okay, why don't you just...

23:02.090 --> 23:05.469
put down the gun and tell me
what's going on here.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.554
Yeah.

23:13.602 --> 23:17.564
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.

23:17.606 --> 23:22.236
- I'm John Klein. My car broke down...
- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.947
Two nights ago...

23:25.030 --> 23:28.992
at 2:30 in the a.m.,
there's a bang on the door.

23:29.868 --> 23:32.329
I open it up,
and here's this guy.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.623
He says he wants to use the phone.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.417
But there's something
creepy about him...

23:37.501 --> 23:39.586
so I tell him to get lost.

23:39.670 --> 23:42.381
Last night at 2:30 on the dot,
guess who's back.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.383
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?

23:44.466 --> 23:47.010
I am absolutely positive
it's Mr. Klein.

23:47.678 --> 23:50.597
- Crazy. This is...
- I am not crazy.

23:50.639 --> 23:53.851
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?

23:53.934 --> 23:56.603
I warned him off my property.

23:56.645 --> 23:58.605
I used the word "trespass",
and he still came back.

23:58.647 --> 24:02.734
You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I
had the right to shoot you on my porch.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.862
He'd have to been
inside the house, Gordon.

24:04.945 --> 24:06.405
What?

24:06.488 --> 24:07.906
Fine.

24:07.948 --> 24:11.910
So tonight I figured the dumb fuck might
come back, and sure enough, there he is.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.497
It wasn't me.

24:15.581 --> 24:18.584
I don't know what's happening here.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.502
Something's very wrong here.

24:22.045 --> 24:25.007
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.301
I'm from DC. Look.

24:28.010 --> 24:29.887
It's a wallet, okay? Wallet?

24:31.263 --> 24:32.639
I'm from DC.

24:32.723 --> 24:34.683
My name is John Klein.

24:42.316 --> 24:43.609
Washington Post.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.110
Yes.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.783
Can I get out of this shower now?

24:58.248 --> 25:00.751
You can wait for me outside,
Mr. Klein.

25:04.213 --> 25:08.759
We'll run a check on him.
Anyone else comes by, forget the gun.

25:08.884 --> 25:10.802
Just call me.

25:10.886 --> 25:13.263
Just find out what he wants.

25:27.194 --> 25:30.155
So, you didn't actually see the guy
before tonight?

25:30.197 --> 25:31.657
No.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.660
But I heard the knocking.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.787
Three nights in a row.

25:40.207 --> 25:42.125
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

25:47.339 --> 25:50.717
I'm gonna give you a ride into town,
unless you wanna sleep in your car.

25:50.801 --> 25:53.220
I can call for a tow
in the morning.

25:58.892 --> 26:01.186
You're a long way from DC.

26:02.187 --> 26:04.147
What are you doing here?

26:05.274 --> 26:06.733
Driving through.

26:08.318 --> 26:11.238
We're not on the way
to anyplace, Mr. Klein.

26:22.499 --> 26:23.876
I recognize you.

26:26.587 --> 26:27.921
DC Review.

26:29.756 --> 26:33.135
- You watch that?
- We're not all bumpkins.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.597
So I'm not under arrest?

26:36.680 --> 26:39.266
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.

26:39.349 --> 26:41.685
No breaking and entering.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.645
You've had trouble
with him before?

26:43.687 --> 26:46.732
Gordy and Denise? No.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.233
They're good people.

26:49.359 --> 26:52.279
Things have just been
a little strange around here lately.

27:05.834 --> 27:09.296
You still haven't told me what you're
doing here in the middle of the night.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.924
I don't know.

27:18.347 --> 27:19.723
Where am I?

27:41.328 --> 27:43.705
Think you could show me
where we are on the map here?

27:43.789 --> 27:46.291
We're right on the state line.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.466
With Ohio.

28:19.283 --> 28:22.327
- What time did you leave DC?
- 1:00 in the morning.

28:22.411 --> 28:25.914
If I was doing 80 the whole way, it
would've taken me six hours to get here.

28:25.998 --> 28:29.376
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.

28:29.459 --> 28:33.964
By the way, don't worry about your pal
the governor. I'll take care of it.

28:34.089 --> 28:35.591
Yeah. Okay.

28:35.716 --> 28:37.092
Thanks, Eddie.

28:37.176 --> 28:39.845
- So?
- It's running fine, Mr. Klein.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.472
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?

28:43.807 --> 28:45.225
Strange.

28:46.768 --> 28:49.730
- All right, what do I owe you?
- Nothin'.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.692
I said I can't find
anything wrong with her.

29:31.605 --> 29:32.689
Mr. Smallwood.

29:36.652 --> 29:38.237
Mr. Smallwood...

29:41.698 --> 29:46.119
I just wanted to apologize for that
misunderstanding we had last night.

29:48.330 --> 29:51.917
Are you sure it was me that came by
the last couple of nights?

29:53.001 --> 29:54.711
Listen, mister.

29:54.795 --> 29:56.672
Connie called me.

29:56.755 --> 30:00.634
She told me that you check out,
and that's good enough for me.

30:00.717 --> 30:04.888
I'm perfectly willing
to let it go.

30:05.639 --> 30:08.600
But I don't drink anymore...

30:08.684 --> 30:10.686
and I don't lie.

30:10.727 --> 30:13.605
And as far as I know,
I'm not crazy.

30:13.689 --> 30:16.441
So if you're accusing me...

30:22.447 --> 30:24.408
Look, here's the thing.

30:26.660 --> 30:29.121
I don't know how
I ended up here last night.

30:31.331 --> 30:34.168
I didn't even know
I was in West Virginia.

30:35.127 --> 30:37.421
Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30...

30:37.504 --> 30:42.050
I traveled 400 miles and ended up
on that road by your house...

30:44.344 --> 30:47.431
and I've got no memory of it.

30:50.058 --> 30:52.269
And you call me crazy?

31:44.321 --> 31:47.241
I was afraid I'd see you here.

31:58.502 --> 31:59.419
Okay.

32:01.964 --> 32:04.591
You didn't show up.

32:04.675 --> 32:07.177
Too bad. I really wanted
to know what I look like.

32:09.596 --> 32:12.015
Sergeant, I'm curious.

32:12.099 --> 32:14.101
Last night you said...

32:14.184 --> 32:17.062
things had been strange...

32:17.145 --> 32:18.564
around here lately.

32:18.605 --> 32:21.900
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.

32:23.068 --> 32:25.028
Now I really need to know.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.698
Just your odd reports.

32:27.823 --> 32:32.119
People seeing things they can't explain,
so they all come to me.

32:32.202 --> 32:33.787
'Cause you're the cop.

32:36.290 --> 32:38.041
Because they know me.

32:43.797 --> 32:47.342
You know, if there are
other people in this town...

32:47.426 --> 32:49.386
who are feeling as...

32:50.554 --> 32:52.472
confused as I am right now...

32:52.556 --> 32:54.141
I'd sure like to hear it.

33:02.608 --> 33:06.028
The past few months,
people have been coming up to me...

33:06.111 --> 33:08.864
and reporting that they've
been seeing strange things.

33:08.947 --> 33:13.493
I don't mean the town speed freak.
I mean good, honest, church going people.

33:14.995 --> 33:16.914
I've known these folks
my entire life...

33:16.997 --> 33:19.291
and they seem down right embarrassed
to be bringing it up.

33:19.374 --> 33:21.126
Bringing what up?

33:21.210 --> 33:23.295
It's hard to explain.

33:59.831 --> 34:02.334
Weird lights,
strange phone calls, you.

34:03.669 --> 34:05.921
Seeing a UFO is one thing.

34:06.046 --> 34:09.925
What do you do when someone tells you
they saw this in their backyard?

34:17.349 --> 34:18.766
What is it?

34:22.563 --> 34:24.147
My wife died two years ago.

34:31.362 --> 34:33.574
She saw something.

34:33.657 --> 34:35.199
Drew pictures.

34:37.327 --> 34:38.786
Who showed you this?

34:50.966 --> 34:52.634
It was right here.

34:53.844 --> 34:57.681
There was only a foot or so
between its head and that branch.

34:57.764 --> 35:00.100
That makes it about...

35:00.184 --> 35:02.352
eight feet tall.

35:02.394 --> 35:04.271
Yeah.

35:04.354 --> 35:08.692
I was getting ready for bed and just
happened to glance out the window.

35:09.610 --> 35:11.528
At first all I could see...

35:11.612 --> 35:15.032
were these two red eyes.

35:15.073 --> 35:17.034
I kept looking at it.

35:18.660 --> 35:20.078
I couldn't stop.

35:21.663 --> 35:25.083
I've never had that feeling before,
like I couldn't move.

35:26.752 --> 35:28.962
And then I guess it just...

35:30.130 --> 35:31.381
took off..

35:37.846 --> 35:40.599
That may not make much sense,
but it's...

35:41.350 --> 35:44.061
the only way I can
put it into words.

36:02.079 --> 36:04.331
You didn't see it, did you?

36:15.634 --> 36:17.761
It started about two months ago.

36:19.429 --> 36:22.724
Every time I answered the phone
I'd hear it.

36:22.808 --> 36:26.562
The first one was just
a loud beeping noise.

36:26.645 --> 36:30.858
Now they're mostly
these creaking, howling sounds.

36:32.609 --> 36:34.111
They all like this?

36:34.152 --> 36:38.031
Well, once it was a man
talking really fast.

36:38.115 --> 36:40.784
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.

36:40.868 --> 36:44.621
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?

36:44.705 --> 36:47.374
I even had our number changed.

36:47.457 --> 36:50.878
But before I got a chance
to give it out to anyone...

36:52.462 --> 36:54.006
the calls started again.

36:59.011 --> 37:02.681
It's not a question of believing them.
Like I said, they're honest people.

37:02.764 --> 37:05.267
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.

37:05.309 --> 37:08.145
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?

37:08.228 --> 37:09.771
Shucks, no.
A real live house.

37:10.647 --> 37:13.025
Indoor plumbing and everything.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.443
Sorry.

37:14.526 --> 37:17.029
We even had shoes for church
and schoolin' and stuff.

37:17.070 --> 37:18.363
All right, all right.

37:23.744 --> 37:25.662
Where the hell are you?

37:25.746 --> 37:27.206
I'm still here.

37:27.289 --> 37:29.333
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.

37:31.001 --> 37:32.252
Something's come up.

37:32.336 --> 37:35.214
You're kidding. Something of
national interest in West Virginia?

37:35.297 --> 37:38.258
No, scientific.
I'll tell you about it later.

37:40.469 --> 37:42.888
Cy's beginning to look rabid.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.515
Keep him at bay, okay?

37:44.598 --> 37:47.184
Are you okay?
You sound a little stressed.

37:47.267 --> 37:49.686
No, I'm fine.
I'll talk to you later.

38:07.329 --> 38:09.456
We were parked up here...

38:09.540 --> 38:11.708
and sort a making out
in the back seat.

38:26.014 --> 38:28.392
And what happened next...

38:28.475 --> 38:30.936
is sort of hard to explain.

38:59.214 --> 39:00.299
Next day...

39:01.633 --> 39:04.178
I woke up and...

39:04.261 --> 39:06.138
both my...

39:06.221 --> 39:08.140
my eyes were swelled up.

39:11.101 --> 39:12.895
What did the doctors say?

39:13.604 --> 39:15.522
He couldn't explain it.

39:18.233 --> 39:20.152
See this one here?

39:22.154 --> 39:24.281
It ain't never healed.

39:29.953 --> 39:31.872
We're getting engaged.

39:34.666 --> 39:36.126
That's good.

41:08.218 --> 41:11.346
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.

41:14.725 --> 41:17.394
Last night I woke up...

41:18.645 --> 41:21.565
with the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.

41:22.274 --> 41:26.361
I went into the bathroom
to get some aspirin...

41:26.445 --> 41:29.072
and I happened
to look in the mirror...

41:30.157 --> 41:32.159
and...

41:32.242 --> 41:34.369
I swear to God...

41:34.453 --> 41:36.371
I see something...

41:36.455 --> 41:38.040
I can't describe.

41:39.208 --> 41:40.959
But it sure as hell...

41:41.043 --> 41:42.794
is not my reflection.

41:44.129 --> 41:46.006
And then...

41:46.089 --> 41:47.424
I hear...

41:48.258 --> 41:49.718
this weird...

41:52.012 --> 41:53.347
howl...

41:54.431 --> 41:56.308
coming out of the sink.

41:58.894 --> 42:00.771
And there's a voice.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.818
It's a voice...

42:08.111 --> 42:09.905
and it's saying...

42:09.947 --> 42:12.616
"Do not be afraid.

42:12.699 --> 42:14.952
Ninety-nine will die.

42:16.578 --> 42:18.038
Denver Nine".

42:19.957 --> 42:21.625
I even wrote it down.

42:24.044 --> 42:27.214
He just keeps saying the same thing
over and over for an hour...

42:27.256 --> 42:30.008
and then it stops.

42:30.092 --> 42:33.095
And when I wake up this morning
I look at this piece of paper...

42:33.178 --> 42:36.348
where I wrote down the words...

42:37.516 --> 42:40.185
and this thing is on it.

42:41.019 --> 42:42.938
I did not draw that.

43:10.007 --> 43:11.884
- Gordon?
- What?

43:11.925 --> 43:15.012
Gordon, you...
your ear's bleeding.

43:15.053 --> 43:16.513
What?

43:33.530 --> 43:35.490
This CAT scan is clean, Gordon.

43:35.532 --> 43:37.451
No sign of any physical problem.

43:37.534 --> 43:42.331
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.

43:42.372 --> 43:44.917
What you had, Gordon,
was a first-class migraine.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.337
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.

43:48.420 --> 43:50.923
- Thank you, Doctor.
- There were other symptoms, Doc.

43:50.964 --> 43:54.426
He had hallucinations,
heard voices.

43:54.510 --> 43:56.762
Aren't they both associated
with glioblastoma?

43:56.803 --> 43:59.932
I see nothing here to suggest...

44:00.015 --> 44:03.018
something as exotic
as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein...

44:03.101 --> 44:06.605
but if you'd like I can refer
Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist...

44:06.688 --> 44:08.649
for a second opinion.

44:09.775 --> 44:11.568
- He's wrong.
- No, that'd be fine.

44:11.652 --> 44:13.028
Thank you.

44:14.112 --> 44:16.073
Thank you very much.

44:21.787 --> 44:23.580
Wait. Wait.

44:23.664 --> 44:25.582
He's not wrong.

44:25.666 --> 44:28.126
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

44:30.128 --> 44:32.548
He's not wrong
'cause there's nothing wrong.

44:35.425 --> 44:36.844
There's nothing wrong.

45:00.158 --> 45:04.913
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear
and he tells you you got a headache...

45:04.997 --> 45:08.417
Yes, well, you're not sick,
so that is good news.

45:08.458 --> 45:11.712
I wish I was sick. Then I would
know why this is happening.

45:11.837 --> 45:14.089
You shouldn't say things like that.

45:14.173 --> 45:18.427
What should I say, Denise?
I'm hallucinating.

45:18.468 --> 45:20.137
I'm hearing voices.

45:20.220 --> 45:23.140
Was your wife hearing voices
before she had her tumor?

45:24.725 --> 45:26.185
No.

45:52.044 --> 45:56.924
13 News is headed to the scene,
and we'll have a live report in minutes.

45:56.924 --> 46:02.095
Again our top story, Domain Air
flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.

46:02.179 --> 46:06.433
An airline representative is expected
to make a statement shortly.

46:06.517 --> 46:07.935
There is no confirmation...

46:07.976 --> 46:11.021
but all 99 passengers and crew members
are believed dead.

46:20.822 --> 46:22.241
Wow, man.

46:31.041 --> 46:33.293
Could I speak to
Alexander Leek, please?

46:33.335 --> 46:35.963
- This is Leek.
- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein.

46:36.004 --> 46:38.131
I'm working on
a pretty strange story.

46:38.215 --> 46:40.843
I was hoping you might be able
to help me out.

46:40.884 --> 46:45.264
I'm particularly interested in your
theories on precognition and prophecies.

46:45.347 --> 46:47.266
Anything you want to know
is in the book.

46:47.349 --> 46:51.770
Yeah, but the chapter that you have
on the entities you call...

46:51.895 --> 46:53.397
Were you contacted...

46:53.480 --> 46:56.358
or are you pretending to have
a professional interest?

46:56.441 --> 46:57.860
Yeah... No.

46:58.902 --> 47:01.113
I'm a reporter
for The Washington Post.

47:01.196 --> 47:04.449
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein.
I don't work in those areas anymore.

47:05.701 --> 47:07.160
I don't understand.

47:20.424 --> 47:22.926
To hear a voice is one thing...

47:23.010 --> 47:26.013
but this isn't just a message,
it's a prediction.

47:26.054 --> 47:27.598
It came true.

47:27.681 --> 47:31.935
These things Gordon's having,
are they dreams or hallucinations?

47:32.019 --> 47:35.272
The way he describes them,
they sound like dreams.

47:35.314 --> 47:36.732
I don't know.

47:38.317 --> 47:40.235
He believes they're real.

47:45.115 --> 47:47.034
I had a dream like that.

47:48.327 --> 47:49.786
Yeah?

47:54.625 --> 47:56.001
It was nighttime...

47:57.127 --> 47:59.546
and I was
in the middle of the ocean.

48:02.174 --> 48:05.344
I was trying to swim,
but I was too cold.

48:07.971 --> 48:10.933
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something...

48:11.683 --> 48:13.310
to hang on to.

48:15.229 --> 48:17.397
And there were presents...

48:17.439 --> 48:18.690
floating all around me.

48:18.774 --> 48:21.235
They were wrapped up.
They were tied with bows.

48:22.778 --> 48:27.366
I tried to grab on to them,
but they kept popping away.

48:30.661 --> 48:32.788
And then I started to sink...

48:34.081 --> 48:35.499
like a stone.

48:37.709 --> 48:40.671
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.

48:42.631 --> 48:44.550
But it felt good.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.306
I was letting go.

48:55.477 --> 48:58.063
I was letting myself go...

48:58.146 --> 49:00.315
and...

49:00.357 --> 49:01.859
all I could see...

49:01.942 --> 49:03.360
was black...

49:03.443 --> 49:06.947
and all I could feel
was the darkness above me...

49:07.030 --> 49:08.949
and the lights...

49:08.991 --> 49:10.909
coming from below.

49:15.080 --> 49:16.498
I knew I was dying.

49:19.877 --> 49:25.132
And then I heard this voice,
like somebody whispering in my ear.

49:25.215 --> 49:27.509
"Wake up, number 37".

49:36.685 --> 49:38.604
And then I woke up.

49:43.358 --> 49:45.277
What do you think that means?

49:47.070 --> 49:48.488
Number 37?

49:49.156 --> 49:51.074
I have absolutely no idea.

50:24.691 --> 50:26.568
I met him.

50:27.277 --> 50:30.489
The guy who told me
about the plane crash.

50:32.324 --> 50:34.826
You met him?

50:34.910 --> 50:35.827
Yeah.

50:36.578 --> 50:38.413
I met him.

50:38.997 --> 50:41.750
Last night, coming home
from work about midnight.

50:41.834 --> 50:44.795
I'm driving past the cement plant...

50:44.878 --> 50:48.048
out by the chemical factory.

50:48.173 --> 50:49.216
Right.

50:49.341 --> 50:51.260
Something happened.

50:58.267 --> 50:59.685
Bright...

50:59.726 --> 51:01.103
flash.

51:01.186 --> 51:02.229
Lightning.

51:06.650 --> 51:07.568
Something...

51:08.193 --> 51:09.111
encircles me.

51:15.659 --> 51:16.994
Everything's kind of hot.

51:19.538 --> 51:21.665
I feel like I can't catch...

51:23.083 --> 51:24.543
catch my breath.

51:58.994 --> 52:00.454
He looked human.

52:01.955 --> 52:04.291
But there was just something...

52:04.374 --> 52:05.834
wrong about him.

52:08.128 --> 52:10.047
That's when I heard the voice.

52:10.839 --> 52:13.008
The same voice
that I heard two nights ago.

52:13.759 --> 52:15.511
He said...

52:15.552 --> 52:17.513
"Do not be afraid.

52:18.764 --> 52:20.349
My name...

52:20.432 --> 52:23.393
is Indrid Cold".

52:28.815 --> 52:30.359
And he said to me...

52:30.484 --> 52:32.444
"In a place this size.

52:32.486 --> 52:34.988
Equator.

52:35.072 --> 52:37.032
Three hundred.

52:37.074 --> 52:39.910
Three hundred will die.

52:42.704 --> 52:44.289
Wait for me.

52:45.415 --> 52:46.834
I will return.

52:48.335 --> 52:50.379
I will see you in time".

52:56.176 --> 52:57.803
And that was it.

53:01.682 --> 53:03.141
It's a little...

53:09.481 --> 53:11.525
Have a look.

53:51.231 --> 53:52.691
She knew.

53:54.985 --> 53:56.445
I didn't see anything.

54:16.298 --> 54:19.843
You want to hear
the chief's latest phone call?

54:49.414 --> 54:50.666
Yes?

54:50.749 --> 54:52.459
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?

54:52.459 --> 54:55.754
I know I sounded crazy the other day,
but things are getting weird out here.

54:55.838 --> 54:57.130
Slow down, Gordon.

54:57.214 --> 54:58.632
- He's here.
- Who's here?

54:58.715 --> 55:02.302
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.

55:02.386 --> 55:05.848
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.

55:07.099 --> 55:10.310
Gordon, let me talk to him.

55:11.603 --> 55:13.689
Sure. Hang on.

55:15.023 --> 55:16.483
Hello, John Klein.

55:18.235 --> 55:20.237
Who is this?

55:20.320 --> 55:22.865
My name is Indrid Cold.

55:27.286 --> 55:29.246
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

55:29.329 --> 55:33.709
Your father was born
in Racine, Wisconsin.

55:33.792 --> 55:36.753
He lived in a green house
on Monroe Street.

55:38.672 --> 55:41.592
You don't remember
how your mother looked.

55:43.802 --> 55:45.721
Okay, you got my attention.

55:54.229 --> 55:56.523
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.

55:58.442 --> 55:59.693
Under the bed.

56:24.760 --> 56:27.387
Very good, John.
Thank you.

56:29.473 --> 56:31.808
What's in my hand?

56:33.435 --> 56:34.728
Chap Stick.

56:39.900 --> 56:42.486
You're reading my mind,
aren't you?

56:42.569 --> 56:44.112
Did you read my mind?

56:44.196 --> 56:47.282
I have no need to, do I?

56:51.286 --> 56:54.790
What's the third line of page 51?

56:56.625 --> 57:01.046
"A broken smile
beneath her whispered wings".

57:02.923 --> 57:05.008
Still more proof, John Klein?

57:10.931 --> 57:12.975
What do you look like?

57:13.058 --> 57:16.270
It depends on who's looking.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.941
I want to meet you.

57:20.983 --> 57:23.443
You already have, John.

57:23.527 --> 57:26.280
I have seen you afraid.

57:26.405 --> 57:28.782
You're afraid right now,
aren't you?

57:31.451 --> 57:34.413
Can I ask you something?

57:35.539 --> 57:38.458
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

57:46.008 --> 57:47.926
What happened to my wife?

57:49.052 --> 57:50.304
You were there.

57:51.930 --> 57:55.517
Mary Klein cannot be found
by looking.

57:55.601 --> 57:57.978
You will see her in time.

58:21.835 --> 58:24.046
What's up, Connie?

58:24.129 --> 58:26.256
Everything okay?

58:27.549 --> 58:29.551
Did you just call John?

58:30.844 --> 58:32.804
I've been asleep since 9:00.

58:46.068 --> 58:49.238
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

58:49.321 --> 58:54.076
See? It's sticking up here
around 1,950 cycles per second.

58:54.117 --> 58:58.705
But it never gets any lower
than maybe 1,930 or so.

58:59.748 --> 59:02.709
But yours is way down here
in the normal vocal range...

59:02.793 --> 59:06.421
anywhere between 1,000
and 1,200 cycles per second.

59:06.547 --> 59:09.967
Okay, so this guy's vocal range
is much higher than mine.

59:11.009 --> 59:13.595
What makes you think it's a man?

59:13.679 --> 59:15.430
Still more proof, John Klein?

59:23.105 --> 59:24.690
What is it?

59:25.566 --> 59:28.318
Near as I can tell, it's...

59:28.360 --> 59:29.736
an electrical impulse.

59:33.949 --> 59:37.160
But whatever it is, it's not
coming from human vocal cords.

59:37.202 --> 59:39.746
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

59:39.872 --> 59:41.582
What happened to my wife?

59:43.417 --> 59:44.835
You were there.

59:46.211 --> 59:49.381
Mary Klein cannot be found
by looking.

59:49.464 --> 59:51.884
You will see her in time.

59:56.388 --> 01:00:00.851
This isn't like you. We used to rip on
this stuff. when it came over the wire.

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:02.019
Yeah, I know.

01:00:02.102 --> 01:00:05.772
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.

01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:08.901
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu. Any excuse.

01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:10.360
I'll back you up.

01:00:10.402 --> 01:00:13.071
I just wanna make sure
you still got a job...

01:00:13.197 --> 01:00:16.700
when you're done doing
whatever it is you're doing down there.

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:18.785
Okay, I'll call you from Chicago.

01:00:22.873 --> 01:00:24.124
What time is your flight?

01:00:26.376 --> 01:00:27.836
8:00 a.m.

01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:33.175
Am I crazy?

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.096
No.

01:00:42.476 --> 01:00:44.144
I am crazy.

01:01:26.687 --> 01:01:28.689
Alexander Leek.

01:01:31.316 --> 01:01:34.736
- Who the hell are you?
-John Klein. I called you last week.

01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:37.948
Do you know what that is?

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:41.910
Stay away.

01:01:43.996 --> 01:01:46.957
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.

01:01:50.169 --> 01:01:52.171
Where are they seeing it?

01:01:52.212 --> 01:01:54.173
Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

01:01:57.634 --> 01:01:59.553
You can help me.

01:02:02.598 --> 01:02:04.016
Follow me.

01:02:10.647 --> 01:02:13.025
The nocturnal butterfly.

01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:17.279
In ancient cultures, the moth
represents a form of the psyche...

01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:20.115
or the soul immortally trapped...

01:02:20.157 --> 01:02:23.744
in the hellish death realms.

01:02:25.746 --> 01:02:27.164
Mothman.

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:33.378
That's what the Ukranians called him.
Rough translation, of course.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.674
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl
the year the nuclear plant went down.

01:02:37.758 --> 01:02:41.011
Galveston, 1969,
just before the hurricane.

01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:42.513
They saw it.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.558
But seeing isn't always believing.

01:02:49.686 --> 01:02:52.606
Look, there's never been
a single shred of evidence...

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:57.444
to show that these things
exist materially.

01:02:57.569 --> 01:03:00.322
So you're telling me
these things do not exist?

01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:05.202
Oh, they exist. All kinds of things
exist around us that we never see.

01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:09.039
Electricity, microwaves,
infrared waves.

01:03:09.122 --> 01:03:12.417
You know, these things
have been around forever.

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:15.629
They show up in cave paintings.

01:03:15.712 --> 01:03:18.215
They're a normal condition
of the planet.

01:03:20.509 --> 01:03:24.638
They're just not part of our consensus
of what constitutes...

01:03:25.931 --> 01:03:27.808
physical reality.

01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:30.143
What are they part of, then?

01:03:32.062 --> 01:03:35.023
You're asking for an explanation...

01:03:35.148 --> 01:03:36.567
for something...

01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:42.197
that can't be explained
rationally.

01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:51.540
You know the buildup of energy
before something happens?

01:03:52.332 --> 01:03:55.085
The way your hair stands up
before lightning strikes?

01:03:55.127 --> 01:03:59.423
"Before something happens".
Do you mean they cause disasters?

01:04:00.257 --> 01:04:02.092
Why would they need to?

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.887
All right, then...

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.972
are they trying to warn me?

01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:12.227
Their motivations...

01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:15.230
aren't human.

01:04:18.233 --> 01:04:20.569
All right,
then what do they want?

01:04:20.652 --> 01:04:22.571
I have no idea.

01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:26.074
What you really want
is to know...

01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:29.244
why you?

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.998
Yes.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:38.712
You noticed them,
and they noticed that you noticed them.

01:04:40.881 --> 01:04:44.218
Most people aren't sensitive enough
to see them...

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:46.929
without some kind of...

01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:51.058
trauma.

01:04:53.685 --> 01:04:55.896
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:03.654
Last week my friend
got a strange phone call...

01:05:03.737 --> 01:05:05.864
from an entity...

01:05:07.115 --> 01:05:08.700
a spirit, whatever.

01:05:10.577 --> 01:05:12.621
It seemed to know everything.

01:05:12.746 --> 01:05:14.164
Like God?

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:17.501
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:20.003
His name was Indrid Cold.

01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:24.216
It's perception, John.
They appear differently to everyone.

01:05:24.258 --> 01:05:27.511
A voice, a light, a man, a monster.

01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:32.266
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke
to, he's off by more than a few degrees.

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:34.768
Then how do you explain
that it knows everything?

01:05:36.645 --> 01:05:37.896
Look at that.

01:05:38.814 --> 01:05:43.610
If there was a car crash 10 blocks away,
that window washer could likely see it.

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:46.655
That doesn't mean he's God...

01:05:46.738 --> 01:05:48.657
or even smarter than we are.

01:05:49.992 --> 01:05:52.786
But from where he's sitting...

01:05:52.828 --> 01:05:55.789
he can see
a little further down the road.

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:59.668
I think we can assume that...

01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:01.670
these entities
are more advanced than us.

01:06:01.753 --> 01:06:06.341
Why don't they just come right out
and tell us what's on their minds?

01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:08.427
You're more advanced
than a cockroach.

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:11.430
Have you ever tried explaining yourself
to one of them?

01:06:15.976 --> 01:06:18.645
How many people have seen it?

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.689
Ten. Twenty, maybe.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.281
Listen to me. Something terrible
is going to happen in Point Pleasant.

01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:32.451
Don't go back.

01:06:33.911 --> 01:06:35.370
Stay away.

01:06:37.706 --> 01:06:39.750
I can't talk about this anymore.

01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:52.346
There is a reason...

01:06:52.471 --> 01:06:54.515
that I ended up in Point Pleasant.

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:58.352
Something brought me there.

01:06:58.477 --> 01:07:00.479
Whatever brought you there...

01:07:02.064 --> 01:07:03.982
brought you there to die.

01:07:48.235 --> 01:07:51.530
You're just in time. They're just
about to light this Christmas tree.

01:07:51.613 --> 01:07:54.032
They have been
for the last two hours.

01:07:55.367 --> 01:07:57.411
Isn't that Denise?

01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:59.454
Is she okay?

01:07:59.538 --> 01:08:00.956
She left Gordon.

01:08:02.499 --> 01:08:05.502
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.

01:08:05.586 --> 01:08:06.545
Shit.

01:08:07.963 --> 01:08:10.757
- Where is he?
- Who knows?

01:08:13.802 --> 01:08:16.054
Be back in a second.

01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:22.019
Connie.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.478
What's wrong?

01:08:25.147 --> 01:08:28.108
Fifteen more people
reported seeing that thing today.

01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:30.402
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.

01:08:33.071 --> 01:08:36.116
I hate this, John.
I absolutely goddamn hate this.

01:08:43.247 --> 01:08:45.167
How was Chicago?

01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:50.671
What did he say?

01:08:52.758 --> 01:08:54.676
He wouldn't see me.

01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:15.029
Shit.

01:09:40.471 --> 01:09:41.932
You all right?

01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:51.567
It's cold.
Get in the car, warm up.

01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:54.152
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.

01:09:59.366 --> 01:10:03.537
Everybody in this town is looking at me
like I'm insane. You know why?

01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:11.336
Denise and all the others,
they don't know, John.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.880
I do.

01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:19.386
I don't think you're crazy.

01:10:19.469 --> 01:10:21.096
Okay?

01:10:21.138 --> 01:10:23.557
You talked to him too, John.

01:10:27.436 --> 01:10:28.896
You know...

01:10:28.937 --> 01:10:31.857
I've been lying awake at night.

01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:34.568
I feel...

01:10:36.111 --> 01:10:37.738
like I'm sleeping...

01:10:38.822 --> 01:10:40.282
but I'm awake.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.704
That's when I hear him.

01:10:45.829 --> 01:10:48.248
And lately, when I hear him...

01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:51.126
all at once...

01:10:54.004 --> 01:10:55.589
I understand.

01:10:59.635 --> 01:11:01.053
Everything.

01:11:05.307 --> 01:11:09.895
John, do you remember
the last time you were happy?

01:11:25.494 --> 01:11:26.954
It's real.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.000
These things are real.

01:12:01.738 --> 01:12:03.824
I want you to be happy.

01:12:14.543 --> 01:12:16.003
Yeah?

01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:20.257
What?

01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:23.260
This is your wake-up call,
Mr. Klein.

01:12:23.343 --> 01:12:25.762
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.

01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:13.852
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.739
I can't believe I got through.

01:13:26.907 --> 01:13:28.909
Gordon, where are you, man?

01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:30.452
Speak up.

01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:33.288
Listen, John, he was right.

01:13:33.372 --> 01:13:35.707
Mr. Cold was right
about everything.

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:39.086
Right? Right about what?
I can't hear you.

01:13:39.127 --> 01:13:41.046
He was right about understanding.

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:44.925
It's real, John.
I want you to know.

01:13:44.967 --> 01:13:48.220
- It's real.
- What is... What are you talking about?

01:13:48.262 --> 01:13:51.598
You've got nothing to worry about.

01:13:51.682 --> 01:13:53.600
I'll see you in time.

01:14:20.377 --> 01:14:21.670
Gordon?

01:15:57.307 --> 01:15:59.726
Can they tell how long
he was out there?

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:03.063
Looks like he's been dead
about eight hours.

01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:06.441
He died of exposure.

01:16:08.402 --> 01:16:10.612
What made you come out here?

01:16:15.492 --> 01:16:17.786
- He called me.
- When?

01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:20.539
I didn't like
the way he sounded.

01:16:20.664 --> 01:16:23.083
When did he call you, John?

01:16:28.213 --> 01:16:29.673
About an hour ago.

01:16:32.342 --> 01:16:33.760
I can't stand this.

01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:23.185
It didn't seem right
to bring this up at the funeral...

01:17:23.268 --> 01:17:26.647
but as far as I know there's never been
any accidents at the chemical plant.

01:17:27.523 --> 01:17:29.399
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:17:29.483 --> 01:17:34.488
I got your message the other day.
I meant to call you back, but I forgot.

01:17:36.907 --> 01:17:39.493
Don't you remember
leaving me that message?

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:42.120
Chief, this is John Klein.

01:17:42.204 --> 01:17:44.414
I didn't call him.
No, it's not me.

01:17:44.456 --> 01:17:47.292
I analyzed both tapes
with the voice print.

01:17:47.376 --> 01:17:50.796
I don't care.
It may be my voice. It's not me.

01:17:50.879 --> 01:17:53.257
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.

01:17:53.298 --> 01:17:56.802
I would swear in a court of law
that that's your voice.

01:17:56.885 --> 01:17:58.929
Yeah, great. Thanks.

01:18:00.639 --> 01:18:01.557
Shit!

01:18:30.836 --> 01:18:33.005
Regular coffee to go, please.

01:18:33.797 --> 01:18:34.840
Seventy-five cents.

01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:39.887
Have a great day.

01:18:50.147 --> 01:18:51.565
Do you know that woman?

01:18:53.025 --> 01:18:56.028
- What woman?
- She just left. You didn't see her?

01:18:56.111 --> 01:18:58.071
- No.
- That's strange.

01:18:58.071 --> 01:19:02.576
She had long red hair, green eyes, real
pretty, and she was asking about you.

01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:21.595
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.

01:19:22.846 --> 01:19:26.391
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.

01:19:26.475 --> 01:19:29.937
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.

01:19:32.105 --> 01:19:35.108
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:36.610
- Did she give you any?
- No.

01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:41.114
She just said "Tell John I'm sorry for
ruining everything", and then she left.

01:19:43.617 --> 01:19:44.743
What's wrong?

01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:50.249
Was it her?

01:19:51.208 --> 01:19:52.167
Was it her?

01:19:55.212 --> 01:19:56.588
That's your wife?

01:19:57.256 --> 01:19:58.674
It was her.

01:19:59.883 --> 01:20:02.261
- I'm not sure.
- What?

01:20:02.302 --> 01:20:03.971
I mean, the hair is different.

01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:06.265
- Oh, come on!
- What?

01:20:06.348 --> 01:20:09.852
- This is the woman you saw.
- No, it isn't, John.

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:12.479
Now, I agree
there is a similarity...

01:20:12.604 --> 01:20:13.856
Bullshit!

01:20:19.528 --> 01:20:21.113
John, it's all right.

01:20:21.154 --> 01:20:23.115
I'm not all right.

01:20:25.659 --> 01:20:29.079
This is the woman you saw.
She was here. This woman.

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:35.711
Don't you do this to me.

01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:31.183
I'm sorry, John.

01:21:31.225 --> 01:21:33.685
I feel like
I've ruined everything.

01:21:33.769 --> 01:21:35.521
I feel like
I've ruined everything.

01:21:41.652 --> 01:21:43.028
I'm so sorry.

01:22:19.481 --> 01:22:21.984
I need to know
what happened to you.

01:22:23.402 --> 01:22:25.779
Please.

01:22:25.863 --> 01:22:27.322
Come in.

01:22:32.786 --> 01:22:36.707
I was a physics professor
at Cornell.

01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:39.501
Tenured.
You can look me up.

01:22:40.586 --> 01:22:43.380
One day
I started hearing voices.

01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:47.801
The voices became messages.

01:22:47.843 --> 01:22:50.929
Before long, I was fully convinced
that I was receiving...

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:54.892
predictions of disaster
from outside intelligences.

01:22:54.933 --> 01:22:56.435
But you were, weren't you?

01:22:56.518 --> 01:22:58.937
John, I had tapes
of their voices.

01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:03.775
I knew a building was going to blow up,
and I tried to prevent it...

01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:07.070
but no one listened.

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:10.574
What happened?

01:23:10.616 --> 01:23:11.992
People died.

01:23:15.954 --> 01:23:17.956
Many people died.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:23.420
I was investigated,
almost arrested.

01:23:25.047 --> 01:23:26.965
My wife divorced me.

01:23:28.258 --> 01:23:30.469
My kids...

01:23:30.552 --> 01:23:32.763
stopped speaking to me.

01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:40.854
Do you know what four years in
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?

01:23:42.898 --> 01:23:44.775
Everything...

01:23:44.858 --> 01:23:46.693
gone.

01:23:47.986 --> 01:23:51.240
Oh, you'll never understand
their messages.

01:23:51.323 --> 01:23:53.534
You'll misinterpret them.

01:23:53.617 --> 01:23:56.286
I did.
It almost destroyed me.

01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:59.498
In the end,
it all came down to just...

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:01.625
one simple question.

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:04.962
Which was more important...

01:24:05.045 --> 01:24:07.047
having proof...

01:24:09.132 --> 01:24:11.051
or being alive?

01:24:15.138 --> 01:24:16.306
Trust me.

01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:19.184
I turned away years ago...

01:24:19.268 --> 01:24:21.520
and I've never looked back.

01:24:24.648 --> 01:24:27.025
Didn't you need to know?

01:24:32.656 --> 01:24:34.825
We're not allowed to know.

01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:19.930
It's me, Cyrus.

01:26:19.972 --> 01:26:21.974
John, is that you?

01:26:22.099 --> 01:26:23.684
Yeah.

01:26:23.809 --> 01:26:24.852
Yeah, it's me.

01:26:24.977 --> 01:26:27.312
Whatever you are doing,
you drop it.

01:26:27.354 --> 01:26:29.314
Governor McCallum
is going to Charleston.

01:26:29.356 --> 01:26:32.317
Then he's touring that chemical plant
in Point Pleasant today.

01:26:32.401 --> 01:26:35.195
Now, I want you to go down there...

01:26:35.279 --> 01:26:37.489
and meet him at the airport.

01:26:39.533 --> 01:26:41.869
You listening?

01:26:41.952 --> 01:26:44.454
Yeah, McCal I um...
at the chemical plant. Got it.

01:26:44.538 --> 01:26:47.374
I need to know that
you're gonna be there.

01:26:47.457 --> 01:26:49.376
John, are you there?

01:27:05.809 --> 01:27:07.311
Ohio.

01:27:07.394 --> 01:27:12.191
Great tragedy
on the River Ohio.

01:27:13.609 --> 01:27:18.572
Great tragedy
on the River Ohio.

01:27:24.036 --> 01:27:27.331
I can't call in sick just because
you have a bad feeling about today.

01:27:27.456 --> 01:27:31.418
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.

01:27:31.543 --> 01:27:33.462
They show up
over the chemical plant.

01:27:33.545 --> 01:27:35.714
Josh gets a call from me,
but it's not really me.

01:27:35.797 --> 01:27:40.177
I'm talking about something bad
happening at the chemical plant.

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:43.180
Then I get this message
from this Indrid Cold...

01:27:43.263 --> 01:27:46.892
who's talking about
a great tragedy on the Ohio River.

01:27:47.976 --> 01:27:50.354
Guess what's on the Ohio River.

01:27:50.437 --> 01:27:51.980
The chemical plant.

01:27:53.273 --> 01:27:56.443
Today Governor McCallum
is gonna be there.

01:27:56.527 --> 01:27:59.279
I was on my way to interview him.
That's how I ended...

01:28:03.992 --> 01:28:06.411
That's how I ended up here.

01:28:09.915 --> 01:28:11.625
My God.

01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:13.752
That's why I'm here.

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:16.922
He was right.

01:28:17.631 --> 01:28:19.591
Who was right?

01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:24.179
You saw Leek.

01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:26.348
- He was part of the warning.
- What?

01:28:26.431 --> 01:28:29.518
He was part of the warning.
Stop, stop, stop.

01:28:29.601 --> 01:28:31.895
I didn't want to scare you.

01:28:34.398 --> 01:28:35.774
He said...

01:28:36.942 --> 01:28:38.902
He said the messages are real.

01:28:40.696 --> 01:28:42.948
Something terrible
is gonna happen.

01:28:45.242 --> 01:28:46.660
Connie, please.

01:28:49.872 --> 01:28:51.957
We have to leave here now.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.001
I will not live
my life like that.

01:28:54.042 --> 01:28:58.422
I will not make decisions based
on messages from Indrid Cold.

01:28:58.463 --> 01:29:00.340
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.

01:29:02.968 --> 01:29:04.928
Okay, I'm going to Charleston.

01:29:05.012 --> 01:29:06.972
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.

01:29:07.055 --> 01:29:08.974
I don't want you anywhere
near the plant today.

01:29:09.057 --> 01:29:10.517
What if nothing happens?

01:29:12.436 --> 01:29:15.772
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?

01:29:15.856 --> 01:29:17.983
- That's not the point.
- Well, I think it is the point.

01:29:18.066 --> 01:29:21.361
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!

01:29:23.405 --> 01:29:25.991
I know what's gonna happen.

01:29:28.202 --> 01:29:30.579
You have to leave now.

01:29:30.662 --> 01:29:34.374
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.

01:30:08.909 --> 01:30:11.203
- Governor?
- Good to see you, John.

01:30:11.286 --> 01:30:13.664
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.

01:30:13.747 --> 01:30:16.124
- What's this about, John?
- It's the tour.

01:30:16.208 --> 01:30:17.876
You can't do it. You can't go.

01:30:18.919 --> 01:30:21.964
Listen to me.
Cancel it. Cancel the tour.

01:30:22.047 --> 01:30:25.509
Cancel it. Make them
shut down the plant now.

01:30:25.592 --> 01:30:27.511
The plant's gonna blow up
while you're there.

01:30:28.762 --> 01:30:31.431
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?

01:30:31.515 --> 01:30:33.600
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.

01:30:33.684 --> 01:30:35.936
Have you received a bomb threat?

01:30:36.019 --> 01:30:39.231
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.

01:30:39.273 --> 01:30:42.734
- I know this sounds...
- You're messing up here, John.

01:30:46.488 --> 01:30:49.283
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.

01:30:59.376 --> 01:31:02.462
Our top story takes us tonight
to Point Pleasant...

01:31:02.546 --> 01:31:05.465
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!

01:31:05.549 --> 01:31:07.634
toured the Edgewater
Petrochemical plant.

01:31:07.718 --> 01:31:10.053
In what he's called
a successful review...

01:31:10.137 --> 01:31:13.724
Governor McCallum has given
high marks to this petrochemical plant.

01:31:13.807 --> 01:31:16.685
He is expected to call
for similar renovations...

01:31:16.768 --> 01:31:18.896
at several Virginia plants.

01:31:18.979 --> 01:31:21.315
WOWK-TV 13...

01:31:21.398 --> 01:31:24.943
has an exclusive look inside
at what the governor saw.

01:31:25.068 --> 01:31:26.403
Son of a bitch.

01:31:26.486 --> 01:31:29.907
I congratulate my friends
at Edgewater Petrochemical...

01:31:29.948 --> 01:31:32.284
on a job well done.

01:31:33.493 --> 01:31:35.120
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
- Excuse me, Mr. Klein.

01:31:35.162 --> 01:31:37.122
You have a message.

01:32:04.358 --> 01:32:05.776
Come in.

01:32:16.662 --> 01:32:18.622
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.

01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:21.959
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.

01:32:24.545 --> 01:32:27.673
- If this is about today...
- No, it's not.

01:32:29.216 --> 01:32:31.134
I got a message.

01:32:32.761 --> 01:32:35.222
I have to go home.

01:32:35.305 --> 01:32:38.392
I have to be there noon
on Friday.

01:32:38.433 --> 01:32:40.686
John, do you realize
what's happening to you?

01:32:45.607 --> 01:32:47.734
I have to go.

01:34:12.236 --> 01:34:14.154
Hey, it's me.

01:34:15.781 --> 01:34:17.741
- Connie?
- Yeah.

01:34:17.783 --> 01:34:21.537
I thought we could chat
for, say, 10 or 15 minutes.

01:34:27.668 --> 01:34:30.671
- I'm sorry. Can I call you back?
- No,you can't.

01:34:31.839 --> 01:34:34.591
- I booked you a flight.
- What?

01:34:34.675 --> 01:34:37.636
It leaves Dulles
for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45.

01:34:39.972 --> 01:34:44.268
I tried to get you on the one to
Charleston, but they're all booked up.

01:34:44.351 --> 01:34:46.854
So if you leave now,
you'll just make it.

01:34:46.937 --> 01:34:48.647
I can't.

01:34:51.567 --> 01:34:54.111
It's Christmas Eve, John.

01:34:54.194 --> 01:34:56.154
You shouldn't be alone.

01:35:00.826 --> 01:35:01.994
I can't.

01:35:02.077 --> 01:35:03.996
Yeah, you can.

01:35:05.998 --> 01:35:07.457
You know...

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:11.253
when Mary got sick...

01:35:11.336 --> 01:35:13.505
I couldn't help thinking...

01:35:13.589 --> 01:35:15.465
this isn't real.

01:35:16.592 --> 01:35:18.844
I can stop this.

01:35:18.927 --> 01:35:21.305
I know I can.
I can stop this.

01:35:22.306 --> 01:35:24.766
No one can stop it, John.

01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:27.769
Listen to me.

01:35:28.854 --> 01:35:32.608
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.

01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:35.027
People you know and love
are going to die...

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:38.447
and no matter what
that voice tells you...

01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:41.825
there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:35:44.077 --> 01:35:46.622
It's two years to the day.

01:35:47.706 --> 01:35:51.835
He told me that she's going to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.

01:35:51.919 --> 01:35:53.128
He's lying.

01:35:55.339 --> 01:35:58.509
Whoever calls
may sound like her...

01:35:58.592 --> 01:36:00.719
but it's not gonna be her.

01:36:01.803 --> 01:36:04.389
I don't know what happens to us
after we die...

01:36:04.473 --> 01:36:07.100
but I'll bet you
wherever Mary is now...

01:36:07.184 --> 01:36:09.770
she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.

01:36:12.064 --> 01:36:13.982
What if it is her?

01:36:19.363 --> 01:36:21.281
She's dead, John.

01:36:23.575 --> 01:36:27.538
The only important question now is
how do you want to remember her?

01:36:32.292 --> 01:36:33.877
I miss her so much.

01:36:33.961 --> 01:36:36.713
I know you do.
Of course you do.

01:36:36.755 --> 01:36:38.715
But, John, listen...

01:36:39.842 --> 01:36:42.845
you can miss her here
just as easily as there.

01:36:42.928 --> 01:36:46.265
Even more easily because there,
you're all alone.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.103
And that's just no way to be.

01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:57.401
You do whatever you need to do...

01:36:57.484 --> 01:36:59.403
and I'll understand.

01:37:00.863 --> 01:37:03.866
But here,
we have dinner at 6:00...

01:37:05.075 --> 01:37:07.327
and we open presents at 8:00.

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:11.540
And we hope we see you.

01:37:14.001 --> 01:37:15.419
Okay?

01:37:20.465 --> 01:37:21.925
Bye, John.

01:39:40.898 --> 01:39:44.401
WJMP time is 5:51
on this chilly Christmas Eve.

01:40:18.519 --> 01:40:20.270
Come on.

01:40:45.879 --> 01:40:50.425
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.

01:40:50.509 --> 01:40:51.969
Shit.

01:41:33.886 --> 01:41:37.514
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:51.737
My God...

01:42:35.322 --> 01:42:37.866
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!

01:42:43.163 --> 01:42:45.707
Get off! Everyone get out
of your cars and get off!

01:42:47.376 --> 01:42:49.586
C.J., come on!

01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:51.964
You've gotta get off.
Turn the damn thing down.

01:42:52.005 --> 01:42:54.174
- What?
- You gotta get off the bridge now!

01:43:24.162 --> 01:43:27.207
- Get out! Get out!
- Let's go!

01:43:40.804 --> 01:43:44.016
Get off!
Get off the bridge!

01:43:46.143 --> 01:43:47.769
Oh, God!

01:43:55.819 --> 01:43:57.112
Go!

01:44:01.742 --> 01:44:04.036
Get out of the car!
Get off the bridge!

01:44:05.621 --> 01:44:07.372
Quick!

01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:16.715
Let's get out!

01:44:24.932 --> 01:44:26.767
Get out!

01:44:42.407 --> 01:44:43.450
Get out!

01:44:46.745 --> 01:44:49.206
Come on. Get out.

01:44:50.082 --> 01:44:52.501
All units, this is unit 64.

01:45:03.679 --> 01:45:05.514
Get out!

01:45:15.023 --> 01:45:16.692
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge.

01:45:44.928 --> 01:45:46.847
Rose, do you copy?

01:45:49.808 --> 01:45:53.145
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge...

01:48:25.005 --> 01:48:27.007
Wake up. Wake up.

01:48:34.223 --> 01:48:36.475
Here we go.

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.999
You are here.

01:50:25.417 --> 01:50:27.753
I didn't know
if I was dreaming or...

01:50:27.836 --> 01:50:29.963
I left DC right after you called.

01:50:32.341 --> 01:50:34.092
You did call me, right?

01:50:36.970 --> 01:50:38.180
Yeah.

01:50:39.389 --> 01:50:41.183
Yeah, I called.

01:50:46.605 --> 01:50:49.024
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

01:50:50.651 --> 01:50:53.403
But I supposed
it could've been a lot worse.

01:50:55.948 --> 01:50:58.909
Are they done with the search?

01:50:58.992 --> 01:51:00.577
Thirty-six.

01:51:02.788 --> 01:51:05.249
Looks like about 36 people.

01:51:06.375 --> 01:51:07.459
Jesus.

01:51:18.178 --> 01:51:19.596
Thirty-six?

01:51:22.766 --> 01:51:24.184
Thirty-six?

01:51:31.984 --> 01:51:34.278
Wake up, number 37.

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:42.900
Wake up

01:51:43.305 --> 01:51:49.317
