00:03.440 --> 00:05.249
Reverend Buddy Boyle's
"Going For Glory Hour."

00:05.280 --> 00:08.887
When angels come a-knocking,
let them on in.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.763
Angels can't possess a human
without permission, right?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.086
- Yep.
- So what,

00:12.120 --> 00:13.565
they're using this guy
to find vessels?

00:13.600 --> 00:14.726
It's a willing audience.

00:14.760 --> 00:15.886
Who put Crowley in charge?

00:15.920 --> 00:17.729
- He's the king.
- He's a salesman.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.884
Right now you and I are gonna
talk about a regime change.

00:23.960 --> 00:24.961
You're ours.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.284
Your demon ass is going to be
a mortal ass pretty damn quick.

00:29.360 --> 00:35.447
Where do I start
to even look for forgiveness?

00:35.520 --> 00:36.681
How about we start with this?

00:37.840 --> 00:38.841
Aah!

00:39.840 --> 00:40.841
You're human?

00:42.680 --> 00:44.284
- Zeke.
- Castiel cannot stay here.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.129
He will bring the angels
down on all of us.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.127
He's warded.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.605
He was warded
when April found him.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.641
Castiel is in danger.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.001
And if he is here,
I am in danger.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.002
Wait, you're in danger?

00:53.080 --> 00:54.809
If he stays,

00:54.880 --> 00:56.644
I am afraid I will have
no choice but to leave.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.920
Cass, can we talk?

00:57.960 --> 01:00.440
You can't stay.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.401
Sir?

01:09.480 --> 01:10.970
Sir, can you hear me?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.162
Please,
please just say something.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.167
Are you still there?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.167
Keep talking,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.009
and I can help you through this.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.360
Please, sir, if you can hear me,

01:18.400 --> 01:20.129
stay on the phone.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.360
It may feel hopeless right now,

01:21.400 --> 01:23.926
but you called the hotline
for a reason.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.162
There's some part of you
that still wants to live,

01:26.200 --> 01:27.850
some part that knows suici...

02:08.479 --> 02:09.561
Who are you?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.569
Did the lady from the hotline
send you?

02:13.640 --> 02:15.051
No.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.480
You did.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.725
Ahh!

02:45.440 --> 02:47.602
You catch that game
last night?

02:47.680 --> 02:48.602
Almost had to turn it off.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.211
It was horrible.
Throw an interception?

02:51.280 --> 02:52.441
Who's he throwing to, seriously?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.443
The other team.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.562
I know. And that play
the second quarter? I mean...

02:56.600 --> 02:57.680
What team is he playing for?

02:57.720 --> 02:58.721
Not ours.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.726
High-five.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.171
- Morning, Steve.
- Bill.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.487
Hi... five.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.166
Sorry I'm late.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.163
I had to drop the baby off
at daycare,

03:31.240 --> 03:34.084
then hit every red light
on the way here,

03:34.120 --> 03:36.122
but guess
I shouldn't have worried.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.361
Place looks great.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.408
Coffee urns.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.323
- Uh, full.
- Dairy case.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.408
- Stocked.
- Okay, Steve, last question,

03:42.480 --> 03:44.323
where have you been all my life?

03:46.040 --> 03:48.202
You're not like
the other sales associates.

03:48.280 --> 03:51.124
There's something different
about you.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.889
I can assure you
there's... There's not.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.367
I know these things.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
You're...

03:57.880 --> 03:59.086
Mm. You're special.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.850
That's your "big news,"

04:14.880 --> 04:17.120
is that you translated
the tablet into

04:17.160 --> 04:18.207
doodles?

04:18.279 --> 04:19.519
It's cuneiform.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.360
I hit a wall translating
the tablet into English.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.925
But I found an ancient codex

04:25.000 --> 04:28.402
linking the Angel script
to Proto-Elamite cuneiform,

04:28.480 --> 04:30.130
and I was able
to translate the tablet

04:30.200 --> 04:32.931
and the footnotes
into Elamite, which is...

04:33.040 --> 04:33.962
Doodles.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.042
It's extinct.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.360
Well, can you read it?

04:37.400 --> 04:38.367
No one can.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.731
Scholars have tried
for centuries.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.161
So it's a dead end?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.123
N-Not quite.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.885
Now most Proto-Elamite
is abstract,

04:46.920 --> 04:48.410
but I was able to decipher

04:48.480 --> 04:50.448
one phrase
from Metatron's footnotes.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.688
"Falling angels."

04:52.720 --> 04:57.408
Okay, so the footnotes
refer to Metatron's spell?

04:57.440 --> 04:58.726
Maybe.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.641
Okay.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.246
Well, maybe if we can
decipher the footnotes,

05:05.320 --> 05:07.687
then we can
reverse the spell and...

05:07.720 --> 05:09.688
Punt those winged dicks
back to heaven.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.960
Where do we start?

05:11.080 --> 05:12.320
Research.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.241
We comb through the library,

05:15.320 --> 05:17.448
see if we can find
anything else on Elamite.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.922
"Zimmerman's Encyclopedia
of Extinct Languages, Volume One:

05:23.960 --> 05:26.930
Adai to Atakapa."

05:26.960 --> 05:28.291
How many volumes are there?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.407
Twenty-four.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.803
Don't worry, we've got them all.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.120
Awesome.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.847
Heh.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.681
There is a God.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.525
Hello.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.090
I may have a case for you.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.288
Four missing in Rexford, Idaho.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.486
Presumed dead,

05:48.560 --> 05:50.722
but no bodies have been
released to loved ones.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.569
And there were reports

05:52.600 --> 05:54.728
of a strange substance
at the scenes.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.603
Oh, well,
hello to you too, Cass.

05:56.760 --> 05:57.760
How are you?

05:58.640 --> 06:01.530
I am busy.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.045
All right. So how do you
want to do this?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.042
You want to meet up
at the latest scene?

06:04.120 --> 06:06.043
You want me to pick you up?
What?

06:07.920 --> 06:10.651
Um, I've got my hands full
over here.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.131
I just... um...

06:12.200 --> 06:13.531
Cass? Hello?

06:13.640 --> 06:15.449
Thought you would want to know
about the case.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.290
Hey, are you sure
everything's...

06:20.280 --> 06:21.645
Okay.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.523
So he said nothing
about where he is or...

06:23.840 --> 06:25.046
Or what he's been doing?

06:25.120 --> 06:26.121
This is Cass.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.810
In case you forgot,
he's not exactly Chatty Cathy.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.644
And you're not even gonna
see him when you're in Idaho?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.648
Well, like I said, as long as
he's catnip for angels,

06:31.720 --> 06:33.768
he's keeping his distance.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.167
So then what's the point, Dean?

06:37.200 --> 06:38.531
I mean, it's barely even a case.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.285
That's why I'm just gonna
go have a little look-see,

06:41.320 --> 06:43.163
and we're not gonna waste
a whole lot of manpower

06:43.240 --> 06:44.366
on a big pile of nada.

06:44.440 --> 06:48.081
In other words, a perfect excuse
to bail out on research.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.241
You got me.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.006
Hey, Steve.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.883
I found this
in the supply closet.

06:56.960 --> 06:57.961
Do you know whose it is?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.684
Um...

07:02.320 --> 07:04.527
...that's mine.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.686
Thanks.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.881
I also found
a rolled-up sleeping bag

07:10.960 --> 07:12.803
behind the tool locker.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.411
Yes, I wanted to be thorough
with inventory,

07:15.480 --> 07:17.403
so I worked late last week,

07:17.480 --> 07:20.051
and taking a nap here
was easier than

07:20.080 --> 07:22.367
going back home to my bed.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.807
Which I have, of course,

07:24.880 --> 07:26.211
a bed and a home.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.845
Wow, Steve, you're so...

07:29.480 --> 07:30.925
...responsible.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.890
I've been afraid to ask.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.645
I don't want to take advantage
of you as my employee,

07:39.720 --> 07:42.291
and I certainly
don't want to jeopardize

07:42.360 --> 07:43.566
our working relationship.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.841
But as a working single mom,

07:45.880 --> 07:47.723
it's hard enough to get a date,

07:47.760 --> 07:50.047
let alone
meet a really great guy.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.007
And tomorrow's my night off,
and I know you're off, too,

07:55.040 --> 07:57.884
and I was just wondering
if there's any chance you're

07:57.960 --> 07:59.530
free tomorrow night?

08:01.240 --> 08:02.810
Yes?

08:05.520 --> 08:06.601
Yes.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.327
You're the best.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.645
So, uh, four missing?

08:24.720 --> 08:26.927
Four dead.
Just got confirmation.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.650
And, uh, any common threads
you can think of?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.121
Well, Joe in there

08:34.240 --> 08:37.482
had the suicide hotline
on speed dial.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.403
The gal before him
was a shut-in,

08:39.440 --> 08:41.760
had enough antidepressants
in her medicine cabinet

08:41.840 --> 08:43.490
to stock a pharmacy.

08:43.559 --> 08:44.561
The first victims,

08:44.600 --> 08:46.090
a married couple
out of Sugar City.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.930
Pretty much a walking billboard
for no-fault divorce.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.644
Were they all basket cases?

08:50.720 --> 08:54.486
If you asked me to make a list
of this county's saddest sacks,

08:54.560 --> 08:57.291
these four would've been
right on top.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.651
All right, so
four unhappy people,

08:58.680 --> 09:00.011
one of them definitely suicidal.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.240
But you've ruled out suicide.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.491
You're gonna
want to put these on.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.485
This look like suicide to you?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Blood?

09:29.120 --> 09:31.930
If the tests come back
same as the others,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.411
it's everything.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.450
Blood, skin, hair, nails,
internal organs,

09:36.480 --> 09:37.527
even clothing fibers.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.931
Like these poor souls

09:39.000 --> 09:41.128
got a run through
the world's finest woodchipper.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.969
What about witnesses?

09:43.200 --> 09:43.962
Same as the rest.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.243
Neighbors reported
some kind of a pink flash.

09:47.320 --> 09:51.211
By the time we got here,
all that was left was... this.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.368
Yeah, we're almost
through the texts over here.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.447
We got nothing.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.010
Have you tried
Professor Morrison?

10:00.080 --> 10:01.570
Yeah, he's unreachable.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.766
He took a sabbatical

10:02.840 --> 10:06.367
to live amongst the Trobrianders
of Papua New Guinea.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.289
Needless to say,
we 're pretty burnt.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.600
Well, there's one guy there

10:09.640 --> 10:11.210
who is nothing
if not well-rested.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.765
- Crowley?
- I m just saying.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.042
We're not keeping him chained up
for the one-liners.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.281
It's worth a shot, I guess.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.282
Just be careful, all right?

10:17.360 --> 10:19.203
Don't fall for any of his
"quid pro quo" crap.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.208
Noted.
So what about you?

10:21.240 --> 10:22.969
How's Cass' lead panning out?

10:23.040 --> 10:24.371
Four victims suddenly exploded.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.811
I tried EMF.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.281
I've looked for hex bags,
sulfur, nada.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.361
Spontaneous combustion?

10:29.440 --> 10:30.521
Maybe the Thules?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.085
No, no, no. I already
ruled them out.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.000
The bodies were vaporized.
They weren't burned.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.804
That sounds like a real case.

10:35.880 --> 10:36.881
Dean, I should be there.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.208
No, man. That's...
That's not necessary.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.207
No, I, uh...

10:41.240 --> 10:42.685
I got this one covered.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.401
He dumped me, Jace.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.244
In the cafeteria.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.850
In front of everyone.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.241
It's just like,
who does that, you know?

11:00.280 --> 11:02.248
Like, why couldn't
he just dump me on Facebook

11:02.280 --> 11:03.281
like a normal person?

11:05.920 --> 11:08.241
But I've been destroyed.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.090
Socially and romantically
totaled.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.606
I know.
Just so embarrassed, Jace.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.530
I could just die.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.566
I can help with that.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.360
What?

11:28.120 --> 11:28.769
Aah!

11:34.200 --> 11:35.201
Thanks.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.962
Good day, ma'am.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.843
And good luck.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.283
I'll have some beef jerky
and a pack of menthols.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.084
What are you doing here?

11:52.120 --> 11:54.043
Gee, it's nice to see you, too,
Cass.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.168
It's Steve now.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.403
And, yeah, you surprised me.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.891
Well, the feeling is mutual.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.088
I mean, I knew you had to
lay low from the angel threat,

12:03.120 --> 12:04.770
but, wow, this is some cover.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.762
My grace is gone.
What did you expect?

12:11.800 --> 12:13.848
Do you have any idea
how hard it was?

12:13.960 --> 12:16.486
When I fell to earth,
I didn't just lose my powers.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.561
I...

12:19.360 --> 12:20.566
I had nothing.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.571
Now

12:23.640 --> 12:25.005
I'm a sales associate.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.007
A sales associate?

12:26.040 --> 12:27.640
Hey, Steve. Just sign here.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.930
I'm responsible for inventory,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.641
sales, customer service.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.647
- I keep this place...
- Thank you.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.921
Thank you.
Clean and presentable.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.571
And when my manager's busy,
I even prepare the food.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.923
Wow.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.846
So you went from fighting
heavenly battles

12:47.880 --> 12:50.690
to nuking taquitos?

12:50.760 --> 12:52.364
Nachos, too.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.450
I've been politely asking
for reading material for weeks,

12:56.520 --> 12:57.885
and this is what you bring me?

13:01.480 --> 13:02.527
Pass.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.444
Can you read Elamite or not?

13:05.520 --> 13:09.730
It's by no means my favorite
of the ancient tongues, but yes.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.325
Will you help us read it?

13:11.360 --> 13:13.931
Why on earth would I?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.128
Because I was there that night.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.567
I saw what humanity did to you.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.885
Like it or not, there's
still a little part of you

13:21.920 --> 13:23.365
that's not a douche.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.448
Sorry, moose.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.800
To the last drop.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.521
Heh.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.889
Crowley, the only reason
you're alive

13:35.960 --> 13:39.487
is because my brother
thought you would be useful.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.607
So far, you've done jack.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.810
Back to plan B, I guess.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.245
Which is?

13:48.320 --> 13:50.721
Give you up to Abaddon.

13:50.760 --> 13:54.207
You think you can
threaten me with that hack?

13:54.240 --> 13:56.766
She's all fury, no finesse.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.810
I'm not so sure.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.929
Our last encounter with Abaddon,
she was...

14:02.960 --> 14:04.485
she was pretty terrifying.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.526
Scarier than you've been
in years.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.601
Bring that to me.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.807
This is not you, man.
You are above this.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.120
Come on.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.043
No, Dean.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.724
I'm not.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.644
I failed at being an angel.

14:45.720 --> 14:49.122
Everything I ever attempted
came out wrong.

14:49.160 --> 14:53.961
But here, at least, I have a
shot at getting things right.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.001
I guess you can't see it,

14:55.120 --> 14:58.329
but there's a real dignity
in what I do,

14:58.400 --> 14:59.561
a human dignity.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.085
Hate to interrupt
you guys, but, Steve,

15:01.160 --> 15:02.920
a customer had an accident
in the men's room.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.082
I'm on it.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.571
Oh, and tonight,

15:06.640 --> 15:08.847
7:00 at my place
work for you?

15:08.920 --> 15:11.082
Great.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.241
You're the best.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.247
That's what this is about.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.288
What?

15:19.320 --> 15:20.287
The girl.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.164
No, Dean.
It's not.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.607
Nora,

15:25.760 --> 15:27.091
she's a very nice woman.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.881
I'm pretty sure she's not
a reaper intent on killing me,

15:30.960 --> 15:33.281
and she's asked me out.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.681
Going on dates, that's something
humans do, right?

15:35.760 --> 15:36.966
Yeah, I mean,
my dates usually end

15:37.000 --> 15:38.684
when I run out of singles,
but, yeah,

15:38.760 --> 15:41.001
yeah, that's something
that humans do.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.206
This is Agent Lee Ermey.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.564
I'll be right there.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.005
There was another kill
over at the high school.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.041
You coming?

15:53.080 --> 15:55.321
I wouldn't be much use.
I don't have my powers.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.408
So?
I've never had powers.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.720
You are a hunter.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.565
And you're a hunter-in-training,
remember?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.443
Yeah, I remember.
And you said I sucked.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.726
I didn't say that.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.450
I said that there was, uh...
uh, you know,

16:06.520 --> 16:07.646
room for improvement.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.041
Come on.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.128
All right, my shift's over
in five minutes,

16:12.240 --> 16:13.446
and my date's
not until later, so...

16:13.520 --> 16:15.249
Attaboy.
I'll go get the car.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.406
Not just yet.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.883
I have to clean the bathroom.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.080
One second we're talking,

16:54.120 --> 16:57.966
and the next,
she just... stops.

16:58.040 --> 17:01.123
And then everyone
in the cafeteria freaks,

17:01.160 --> 17:03.561
rushing and pointing out
the window, at...

17:08.119 --> 17:10.167
Could... could that
really be her?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.367
And nobody saw anybody else
at the scene,

17:14.440 --> 17:16.807
a man, a woman,
anything unusual?

17:18.960 --> 17:21.008
Your friend, was she depressed?

17:21.079 --> 17:22.444
Depressed?

17:22.560 --> 17:23.641
Any thoughts of suicide?

17:25.480 --> 17:27.721
Ew. No.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.724
I mean, she was kind of bummed

17:30.800 --> 17:32.802
that dick-bag Travis
broke up with her

17:32.880 --> 17:34.086
in front of the whole school.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.406
Kind of bummed?

17:35.480 --> 17:36.402
Yeah.

17:36.480 --> 17:40.246
Like more bummed than
when she got a "C" on a quiz,

17:40.320 --> 17:41.970
and

17:42.080 --> 17:44.208
less bummed
than when her parents split up.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.645
Kind of bummed.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.327
Excuse me.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.647
Cass, what's wrong?

18:08.720 --> 18:10.563
I've seen this before.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.562
What? Where?

18:11.640 --> 18:13.722
In heaven.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.167
What, you're saying
an angel did this?

18:16.240 --> 18:17.526
It's no ordinary angel.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.966
Dean, this is bad.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.365
This is very bad.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.529
On the battlefields of heaven,

18:33.600 --> 18:37.650
there was a special class
of angel, the Rit Zien.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.684
It's Enochian
for "Hands of Mercy."

18:40.720 --> 18:42.563
They functioned like medics.
They tended to the wounded.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.808
They healed those
who could be healed,

18:44.880 --> 18:48.043
but for the mortally wounded,
those who were past saving,

18:48.120 --> 18:50.009
the Rit Zien's job
was to put them down.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.804
By the granulated bodies?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.281
This was their special ability.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.166
They had this way of smiting
that was so quick and so total

18:58.240 --> 19:00.083
that it rendered death
virtually painless.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.089
Yeah, but these
aren't wounded angels

19:02.200 --> 19:03.611
that they're vaporizing,
they're people.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.728
Right.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.888
I don't know.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.721
The Rit Zien home in on pain,
it's like a beacon to them.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.923
So when this angel
fell to Earth,

19:14.960 --> 19:17.088
he heard the victims' cries,
their anguish,

19:19.280 --> 19:20.930
same as he'd hear
an angel's in heaven.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.810
He's continuing
his heavenly work down here,

19:23.880 --> 19:25.530
one suffering human at a time.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.360
Yeah, but this last victim
was not suffering.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.209
She was just a normal,
moody kid.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.241
But he just got here.

19:30.280 --> 19:33.807
The ebb and flow
of human emotion.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.362
Dean, I've been on earth
for a few years,

19:37.440 --> 19:39.204
and I've only begun to grasp it.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.647
To him, pain is pain.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.449
So everybody's fair game?

19:45.920 --> 19:48.207
All right, well,
we got to stop him.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.249
You have to stop him.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.450
You're scared.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.965
It's different now, Dean.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.325
Everything feels different.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.364
You're right.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.364
All right, I'll track down this
Kevorkian wannabe,

20:08.440 --> 20:09.646
and I'll put him down.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.846
Okay.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.365
You stay safe.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.970
Go on that date, all right?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.008
Go live a normal life.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.046
Okay.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.200
Well?

20:32.480 --> 20:33.641
I need a ride.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.761
Right.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.681
I'll do it.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.849
But I want something in return.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.126
Yeah, what's that?

20:53.280 --> 20:54.884
A telephone call.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.650
Come on, moose.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.923
Even Dahmer
got one telephone call.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.001
Seriously?

21:06.040 --> 21:08.202
You want to let Crowley
communicate with Abaddon?

21:08.280 --> 21:11.523
A king and a power-mad knight
of hell isn't enough for you?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.369
You want to throw a demonic
team-up into the mix?

21:13.400 --> 21:14.811
I don't think so.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.729
I mean,
I don't trust Crowley, either.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.610
But I can't honestly see him
working with Abaddon.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.886
He hates her too much.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.241
You said it.
You can't trust him.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.242
We don't have to.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.970
Look, Crowley's bound.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.849
We can end the call
whenever we want.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.326
Even if he wanted
to give Abaddon information,

21:30.360 --> 21:31.361
he has none to give her.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.731
He doesn't even know
where the bunker is.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.280
He says he can decrypt
the translation?

21:37.440 --> 21:38.851
What if he's lying?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.770
You're right.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.243
We're gonna need proof.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.561
What are these?

21:49.720 --> 21:50.687
Ingredients.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.210
More specific.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.562
Ingredients for a spell.

22:03.520 --> 22:04.442
Heart of a Nephilim.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.931
Cupid's bow.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.166
Grace of an angel.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.441
And the rest of them.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.526
Phone call.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.364
You'll get the rest
when I get paid.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.843
Now who's gonna be a dear
and open up a vein?

22:32.320 --> 22:33.320
Okay.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.161
Thanks, Dean.

22:37.680 --> 22:38.681
Cass.

22:38.760 --> 22:39.761
Wait.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.968
I can't let you do this.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.968
What?

22:47.000 --> 22:50.447
You're gonna wear that
on a date?

22:50.480 --> 22:52.209
This is all I have, Dean.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.568
Okay.
Uh, lose the vest.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.005
- What are you...
- Lose the vest.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.560
Come on.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.165
That's a little better.
All right.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.845
There we go.
All right.

23:04.920 --> 23:05.921
And now your buttons.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.769
Why don't you unbutton it?

23:07.800 --> 23:08.767
Okay.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.485
That's far enough, Tony Manero.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.521
Um...

23:14.800 --> 23:16.848
Yeah. Good.
All right.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.081
Listen to me.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.481
Always open the door
for her, okay?

23:20.520 --> 23:22.284
Ask a lot of questions.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.321
They like that.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.847
And, oh, if she says
she's happy to go Dutch,

23:26.920 --> 23:28.763
she's lying.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.569
All right?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.165
Go get him, tiger.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.087
Ow.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.245
Nice touch.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.969
What are you doing, jackass?

24:32.880 --> 24:34.211
Hey.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.402
Steve.
I'm so glad you're here.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.845
Come in.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.924
I thought I was gonna be late.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.081
Late for what?

25:00.120 --> 25:01.087
My date.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.248
Bowling, would you believe it?

25:03.280 --> 25:05.965
But damned
if I'm not dressing fancy,

25:06.040 --> 25:07.485
even for bowling.

25:07.560 --> 25:10.848
Haven't had an excuse
to doll up since Tanya was born.

25:10.920 --> 25:13.605
And there she is,
my little angel.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.051
Now she's already been fed,

25:15.080 --> 25:16.969
she'll probably sleep
the whole time,

25:17.040 --> 25:19.042
and I'll only be gone
a couple of hours.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.690
I just couldn't get
my usual sitter,

25:20.760 --> 25:23.081
and I needed somebody here
just in case she wakes up

25:23.120 --> 25:26.363
and starts crying,
which she won't, I promise.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.965
Baby Tanya never cries.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.166
Wish me luck.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.931
Oh, and thank you.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.450
You really are the best.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.491
Babysitting.

25:58.840 --> 25:59.921
A-bup-bup-bup.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.200
What?

26:01.280 --> 26:03.760
Not yours. His.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.970
What difference does it make?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.331
I've had yours.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.805
Stuck in here,

26:09.920 --> 26:12.844
you can't fault me
for wanting a little variety.

26:12.880 --> 26:13.847
No way.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.167
What's wrong, Short Round?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.167
Afraid of needles?

26:17.200 --> 26:18.611
No,

26:18.680 --> 26:21.331
I just have a policy
of not giving blood

26:21.360 --> 26:24.170
to anyone
who's murdered my mother.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.329
I have nothing but time.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.920
You're a dick.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.370
Good luck with that translation.

27:08.040 --> 27:12.682
Inferni sectatores,
nunc audite regem.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.531
This is Crowley.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.528
Connect me to...

27:18.560 --> 27:19.561
Crowley.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.281
Bad connection.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.766
Crowley. Your king.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.731
If you don't connect me
to Abaddon right away,

27:32.760 --> 27:34.171
I will be forced to...

27:35.760 --> 27:38.411
What?
What happened?

27:38.480 --> 27:39.925
I've been placed on hold.

27:42.880 --> 27:43.881
Hello?

27:46.400 --> 27:47.401
Um...

27:50.160 --> 27:52.925
Please, please don't.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.487
Okay.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.446
Okay, okay.
How about...

28:08.480 --> 28:09.845
how about a lullaby?

28:09.920 --> 28:11.160
Um.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.165
Okay. Shh. Shh.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.281
Sheriff?

29:12.320 --> 29:13.685
Now here's a wrinkle.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.529
Our first crime scene,
married couple?

29:15.600 --> 29:19.161
Full analysis of the spray
came in from the lab.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.931
Turns out it only contains
the wife's DNA.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.406
The husband's still out there.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.490
Nobody told you.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.490
Nobody explained.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.411
You're just shoved out

29:35.480 --> 29:38.768
kicking and screaming
into this human life,

29:38.880 --> 29:44.603
without any idea why any of it
feels the way it feels,

29:44.680 --> 29:47.081
or why this confusion,

29:47.160 --> 29:48.082
which feels like

29:48.160 --> 29:52.882
it's a hair's breadth
from terror or pain.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.160
You know, just when you
think you do understand,

29:57.200 --> 29:58.361
it'll turn out you're wrong.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.041
You didn't understand
anything at all.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.401
Guess that's just how it is
when you're new at this.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.602
You know,
it wasn't that long ago

30:08.680 --> 30:11.809
when all I'd need to do
to ease your pain was touch you.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.250
You're very warm.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.560
Is that normal?

30:22.720 --> 30:25.087
Oh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.442
He was already a bit screwy,
then he found religion.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.081
She was a hard-line atheist,
no peach herself.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.964
When he got himself obsessed
with this Buddy Boyle whack job,

30:35.040 --> 30:37.247
an already bad marriage
got worse.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.163
Kept telling her
to "Let God in."

30:39.240 --> 30:41.049
Buddy Boyle.
That explains it.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.127
Explains what?

30:42.200 --> 30:45.443
Never mind. Let's see.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.922
- Is that his truck?
- Yep.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.687
Cass.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.206
Nora, she's hot.
She's really hot.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.204
Please just call... Call me.
Call... Call back.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.124
If I don't hear back,
I'm taking her to the hospital.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.041
Okay, Tanya,
we're taking a little walk.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.411
Hello, Castiel.

31:38.800 --> 31:39.881
Squalid little dump.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.729
No wonder she cries.

31:41.800 --> 31:46.044
It's a fever, Ephraim.
It will pass.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.963
You remember my name?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.048
I was just a nobody when we met,

31:50.120 --> 31:54.489
but you...
you were a legend.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.721
You've been here before.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.122
This is my first time, and it's

31:59.160 --> 32:00.321
intense.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.725
You know, there's a lot
you don't understand

32:01.800 --> 32:04.246
about humanity at first.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.685
If you would just stop...

32:05.720 --> 32:06.801
Stop?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.049
I won't stop

32:10.120 --> 32:13.442
until I wash the planet clean
of all suffering.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.201
Allow me.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.089
Don't touch her.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.367
You think I came for her?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.290
No, Castiel.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.044
I came for you.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.087
How long does it take to
transfer a demonic phone call?

32:37.160 --> 32:38.685
Can it, moose.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.361
- Crowley, you got your call.
- Yeah, it's time.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.880
It's time when I bloody well
say it's time.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.247
Hello, Abaddon.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.966
Crowley,
how in the hell are you?

32:55.680 --> 32:58.968
So much pain and despair,

32:59.080 --> 33:02.243
so many voices
begging out for relief.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.281
How'd you find me?

33:05.280 --> 33:07.726
Because you're warded.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.411
The same way
I find all my patients,

33:10.480 --> 33:12.767
I just followed
the sound of your pain.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.530
You have no idea how loud it is.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.325
I could hear you for miles.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.322
Do you really think

33:21.400 --> 33:23.050
you're doing heaven's
work down here?

33:23.080 --> 33:24.206
I know I am.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.571
You're wrong.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.763
Earth, it can be a hard place.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.565
But these humans,
they can get better.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.284
They're just doing
the best they can.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.926
Is that what you think
you're doing, Castiel,

33:36.000 --> 33:37.923
the best you can?

33:37.960 --> 33:39.803
Well, I'm sorry.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.531
But if this is the best
that the famed Castiel can do,

33:42.600 --> 33:44.841
you're a more urgent case
than I thought.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.571
I used to admire you.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.570
You failed more often
than you succeeded.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.841
But at least you played big.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.291
Ugh!

34:01.320 --> 34:02.765
Now what are you doing?

34:03.920 --> 34:05.684
Burying your head in the sand

34:05.760 --> 34:08.650
right when your kind
needs you the most.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.850
And how are the numbers?

34:11.880 --> 34:13.643
You mean souls?

34:13.719 --> 34:16.121
I've managed to double
on your projections.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.641
Now how did I ever pull off

34:18.719 --> 34:20.051
such a feat?

34:20.159 --> 34:22.766
You're taking souls
before their time.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.161
Voiding my contracts.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.239
That's right.

34:28.280 --> 34:32.170
I'm taking it all down,
brick by brick.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.400
It's over.

34:33.480 --> 34:36.643
The days of Crowley,
the king of bureaucrats,

34:36.760 --> 34:38.091
are done.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.723
Shh. Shh. Shh.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.085
It'll be over soon.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.730
I'll take the pain away.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.324
I want to live.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.929
But as what, Castiel?

34:48.000 --> 34:51.527
As an angel... or a man?

34:59.400 --> 35:00.367
You

35:00.400 --> 35:01.731
ganky

35:01.800 --> 35:03.450
putrescent

35:03.520 --> 35:04.681
skanger.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.683
It may look like
bean-counting to you,

35:06.760 --> 35:10.048
it may lack a certain
adolescent flair, but my way

35:10.120 --> 35:12.327
works!

35:12.360 --> 35:17.048
You think you can control hell
with chaos alone,

35:17.120 --> 35:21.682
without the support of those
who are still loyal to me!

35:21.720 --> 35:23.961
No one's seen you in weeks,
and last I saw you,

35:24.040 --> 35:27.726
Howdy and Doody had you tied up
nice and tight.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.280
Seems to reason,

35:30.320 --> 35:31.810
they've turned you
into a kennel dog.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.490
How does it feel, Crowley,

35:35.560 --> 35:37.722
to be the Winchesters' bitch?

35:37.800 --> 35:40.406
It's been fun
indulging in your bluffs,

35:40.440 --> 35:44.889
but we both know
you have no real authority left,

35:44.920 --> 35:45.887
no leverage,

35:45.920 --> 35:48.571
you have nothing to offer me.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.483
You have nothing.

35:50.560 --> 35:53.325
Your way will backfire.

35:55.640 --> 35:58.564
You will burn.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.086
I can't wait.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.004
Crowley?

36:17.080 --> 36:19.048
Bring me the translations.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.569
I keep my agreements.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.245
"Obtain the ingredients,

36:41.280 --> 36:44.250
heart, bow, grace."

36:44.280 --> 36:45.327
Blah, blah, blah.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.529
"Mix until the smoke
shall rise from the ashes,

36:48.640 --> 36:51.246
casting the angels
from heaven."

36:51.280 --> 36:54.648
Blah, blah... Oh.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.681
Hm.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.650
It's irreversible.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.641
What?

37:04.240 --> 37:07.210
The spell can't be undone.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.329
The new world order,

37:10.400 --> 37:11.640
we're stuck with it.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.645
You say you want to live.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.406
But you can't see what I see.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.169
By choosing a human life,
you've already given up.

37:26.440 --> 37:29.683
You chose death.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.410
Aah!

37:47.840 --> 37:50.047
Well, there's no way.
Crowley's lying.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.401
No, Dean, not this time.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.289
Look, Metatron built the spell

37:54.360 --> 37:56.203
to withstand any attempt
to reverse it.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.408
There is no putting the angels
back in heaven.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.641
It's done.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.164
Are you gonna tell Cass?

38:11.360 --> 38:14.125
I'm... sorry, I overreacted.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.282
My friend gave me a tip.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.330
A low dose of acetaminophen
brought the fever right down.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.209
Oh, that's okay.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.203
Date was a bust anyway.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.290
Steve?

38:31.400 --> 38:33.846
The part of you
that overreacted,

38:33.880 --> 38:36.121
that cares so much,

38:37.520 --> 38:39.602
that's what makes you special.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.561
I got to go.

39:02.800 --> 39:03.926
Where to, Cass?

40:07.680 --> 40:10.251
Listen, Cass,

40:10.320 --> 40:11.970
back at the bunker,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.365
I, uh...

40:14.720 --> 40:16.643
Sorry I told you to go.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.124
I know it's been hard on you,
you know, on your own.

40:22.160 --> 40:24.447
Somehow you're adapting.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.521
I'm proud of you.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.889
Thank you, Dean.

40:33.240 --> 40:36.005
But there's something
Ephraim said.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.290
The angels, they need help.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.362
Can I really sit this out?

40:41.400 --> 40:44.210
Shouldn't I be searching
for a way to get them home?

40:44.240 --> 40:46.368
Me and Sam, we'll take care
of the angels.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.322
You're human now.

40:52.360 --> 40:53.646
It's not your problem anymore.

41:32.160 --> 41:35.004
It's been weeks
since the massive meteor storm,

41:35.080 --> 41:36.491
yet Idaho falls astronomers...

41:37.280 --> 41:38.406
still have unanswered questions.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.641
NASA and Washington

41:39.720 --> 41:42.007
are both continuing to study
the phenomenon.
