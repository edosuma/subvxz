(siren wailing )

00:08.884 --> 00:11.387
( panting )

00:12.429 --> 00:14.147
Halt!

00:14.348 --> 00:15.691
I've got to hand it
to this perp.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.110
No one's broken out
of the Infinetentiary before.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.484
He's either the bravest time-convict
I've ever seen or the dumbest.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.491
Ow! Ohh!

00:24.691 --> 00:25.692
My time-knee!

00:25.901 --> 00:27.699
Oh, time-dang it!

00:27.903 --> 00:29.780
Definitely the dumbest.
Freeze!

00:29.988 --> 00:34.164
You're surrounded by the Time Paradox
Avoidance Enforcement Squadron.

00:34.368 --> 00:38.589
Anything you say can and already has
been used against you in future court.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.917
This is it, Blendin.
End of the timeline.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.881
Any last words?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.717
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...
I-I-I-I...

00:45.879 --> 00:49.383
I invoke Globnar!

00:49.591 --> 00:51.685
Globnar!!!
( murmuring )

00:51.885 --> 00:55.139
Very well, speak the name
and century of those accused.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.065
The two kids
that ruined my life,

00:57.266 --> 01:00.486
Dipper and Mabel Pines,
21st century.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.613
So be it.

01:07.818 --> 01:12.574
May Time Baby
have mercy on their souls.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.539
Candy! Candy!
Candy! Candy.

01:58.744 --> 01:59.666
<i>Candy--
Candy--</i>

01:59.870 --> 02:01.543
If No!
s trapped!

02:01.747 --> 02:03.670
Everything
is terrible forever!

02:03.874 --> 02:04.841
Psst.
Hey, dudes.

02:05.000 --> 02:05.876
You want to know a trick?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.670
Boppity-boop-womp!

02:07.878 --> 02:09.221
A genius
taught me that once.

02:09.420 --> 02:13.676
This just in. Weather stations are
calling for a candy blizzard!

02:13.842 --> 02:14.718
Forget taking
off the wrappers.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.805
I'm eating these now!

02:18.013 --> 02:20.641
Soos, you are
the greatest human ever to live.

02:20.849 --> 02:21.850
( Coughing )

02:22.059 --> 02:23.857
That was a mistake!

02:24.061 --> 02:25.313
Hey, no sweat, dude.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.696
I'd do anything
for the Pines family.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.023
STAN: Soos!

02:28.231 --> 02:30.825
I need to scratch myself
in two places at once.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.243
And I mean <i>anything.</i>

02:32.402 --> 02:33.949
Coming, Mr. Pines!

02:35.864 --> 02:37.662
Whoa, better make sure
he gets his wallet back.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.915
Wait, I've never seen
Soos's wallet before.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.713
Don't you want to learn
some Soos secrets?

02:43.914 --> 02:45.837
I don't know if we should be--
Whoa!

02:45.999 --> 02:48.001
Soos has a membership
to laser tag?

02:48.210 --> 02:49.883
I didn't know they let
grown-ups in there.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.715
And look,
emergency salami.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.304
Soos, my respect
for you has grown.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.103
Jesus Esperaminguo Ramirez,

02:58.303 --> 03:00.647
organ donor,
birthday: July 13th.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.814
Wait a minute.

03:02.015 --> 03:02.811
That's today.

03:03.016 --> 03:03.687
Whoa.

03:03.892 --> 03:04.814
That's weird.

03:05.018 --> 03:05.985
I wonder
why he didn't tell anyone.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.312
Uh, duh.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.731
It's probably because
he wants someone

03:08.939 --> 03:10.612
to throw him
a surprise party.

03:10.816 --> 03:11.988
I can relate.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.115
I've been waiting for
a surprise party my whole life.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.866
Surprise!

03:17.114 --> 03:18.912
Too little, too late, Chiu.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.242
Ohh.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.580
More exclamation points!

03:24.788 --> 03:26.290
More, I 53V!

03:26.498 --> 03:28.296
Wow, you guys
thought of everything.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.923
Grenda, twins are born
birthday experts.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.129
We've shared
every birthday together

03:32.337 --> 03:33.805
so we know
how to make them perfect.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.599
( Noisemakers toot )

03:36.800 --> 03:37.722
Hey, places, everyone.

03:37.884 --> 03:38.760
I hear footsteps.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.188
GRENDA: Everyone, be quiet!

03:41.388 --> 03:43.311
All right, you promised
a giant hummingbird,

03:43.515 --> 03:45.563
so I'm expecting to see
a giant hummingbird.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.236
CANDY: Three, two, one...

03:48.437 --> 03:49.814
Huh?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.238
ALL: Surprise!

03:51.440 --> 03:53.534
Happy birthday,
you king on earth.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.906
We got everything you love.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.407
<i>Cake-flavored pizza.</i>

03:56.611 --> 03:57.737
Pizza-flavored cake.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.038
And one more treat.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.625
Razzle dazzle, friends.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.454
It's me, the Razz Dazzler.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.835
This is what
my life has become.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.087
I...I...

04:10.292 --> 04:11.839
Quick,

04:12.002 --> 04:13.720

04:19.468 --> 04:20.810
Soos, what's wrong?

04:21.011 --> 04:22.638
It's, uh, it's nothing.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.805
I, uh...

04:24.014 --> 04:25.937
I gotta go fix a pipe
or something.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.648
Whoa,
did you guys see Soos?

04:29.853 --> 04:31.400
What happened to--
Oh, no.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.815
Oh, no] no, no.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.446
Okay, you guys didn't know,
so it's not your fault,

04:35.650 --> 04:37.277
but Soos hates
his birthday.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.488
BOTH: What?
It's a total mystery.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.369
I guess he's been like this
since he was a kid.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.371
Some weird personal biz.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.623
There's gotta be
something we can do.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.204
We've tried everything.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.584
I even petitioned
the government

04:48.789 --> 04:50.211
to have this day removed
from calendars.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.008
Now I'm not allowed
on airplanes.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.051
( Sighs )

04:57.255 --> 04:58.381
I don't know, guys,

04:58.590 --> 05:00.308
maybe we should just
leave him alone, you know?

05:00.509 --> 05:02.102
No one should be alone
on their birthday.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.724
There's got to be a way
to cheer him up.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.055
We just need to try harder.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.606
You're right,
Dipper!

05:06.765 --> 05:09.439
It's time for us
to bring out the big guns.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.688
All right, guys,

05:12.896 --> 05:14.148
blindfold me once,
shame on you,

05:14.356 --> 05:15.949
blindfold me twice--
Wait a minute.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.526
( Sniffs )
Hot dog smell?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.907
Sticky floors?
Future sounds?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.073
Laser tag?

05:23.240 --> 05:24.583
I love laser tag.

05:24.783 --> 05:25.875
How did you guys know?

05:26.076 --> 05:28.499
We definitely didn't rifle
through your wallet.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.671
( Nervous chuckle )

05:30.872 --> 05:32.499
<i>Welcome to the year 8,000.</i>

05:34.751 --> 05:36.753
<i>Fog machines?
Everywhere.</i>

05:36.920 --> 05:39.594
Are these walls just mattresses
spray-painted purple?

05:39.798 --> 05:41.516
I think this place
used to be a mattress store.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.638
I don't know, guys,

05:42.801 --> 05:44.303
I'm not sure
I'm up for this today.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.387
Don't worry, Soos.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.721
As soon as you start
playing with us,

05:46.930 --> 05:48.102
you're gonna have
a great time.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.728
We promise,
no matter what happens

05:49.933 --> 05:51.150
we won't leave your side.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.774
Well, I guess,
I could give it a shot.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.869
Uh-oh.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.868
Better tie down
these cowboys.

06:07.117 --> 06:10.087
Whoa! This is even cooler
than I imagined.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.998
Look how real
these laser guys are.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.173

06:19.462 --> 06:20.964
( Gasps )
Oh, no.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.970

Mabel? Dipper?
Dudes?

06:25.635 --> 06:26.807
Soos!

06:27.012 --> 06:29.811
Nice try, but that's
solid timetanium, kid.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.188
There's only one way
out of here.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.939
MAN: Through me!

06:35.812 --> 06:37.860
Oh, u h, sorry.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.611
Come on.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.534
Through me!

06:41.735 --> 06:42.782
And that's what
it would have been like

06:42.986 --> 06:45.739
if I'd just gotten it right
the very first chance,

06:45.947 --> 06:47.073
but it still is effective.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.366
<i>( Both gasp )</i>

06:49.618 --> 06:52.371

How could you not know my name
after you ruined my life?!

Initiate flashback!

07:08.136 --> 07:10.230
<i>It was after you

<i>my whole life's purpose.</i>

<i>And then I was given</i>

<i>ten squared life sentences
in time prison.</i>

07:20.607 --> 07:23.451
<i>I've spent every day since then
planning my vengeance.</i>

07:25.695 --> 07:29.325
And now finally,
it has come!

07:29.532 --> 07:30.704
Look, we're sorry
about all that,

07:30.909 --> 07:31.910
but we're in the middle
of something

07:32.118 --> 07:33.290
really important
right now.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.747
It's our friend's
birthday today,

07:34.955 --> 07:36.628
and we promised
we wouldn't leave his side.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.835
What?! You think some dumb
birthday matters right now?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.298

09:43.792 --> 09:46.511
Looks like they overshot
their destination by 10 years.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.964
I don't see them.
You better find those kids!

09:49.172 --> 09:50.765
You'll get your justice,
Blendin.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.184
I'm gonna keep stammering
until you find them.

09:53.384 --> 09:56.763
I-I-I-I...

09:56.971 --> 09:58.894
I hate that guy.
Let's move.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.979
Yeah!
Yeah!

10:04.187 --> 10:06.110
Okay, we just got
to go forward 10 years.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.988
We can be back before Soos
even realizes we were gone.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.286
Oh, no!
The timey thing.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.491
It's busted.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.821
Can you fix it?

10:14.030 --> 10:15.782
Maybe.
I'll need some tools.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.494
And I think I know
where to get some.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.664
Let's try to lay low.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.215
We don't want to change
the future.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.008
Or cause the future.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.631
I forget how this works
exactly.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.679
<i>Wow, 10 years 'm the past.</i>

10:29.879 --> 10:32.723
Everything is samey
but also differenty.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.976
♪ Doppity-doppity-doo ♪

10:35.176 --> 10:36.098
Yeah!

10:36.302 --> 10:40.398
Look out Broadway,
here I come.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.021
This dream goes nowhere,
Toby!

10:43.226 --> 10:45.354
Aww, marbles.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.482
Whoa.
Oops. Sorry.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.566
( Whispering )

10:49.774 --> 10:50.650
My friend thinks you're cute.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.827
Oh, my gosh.
Tambry, shut up.

10:53.027 --> 10:53.994
Ow! Hey!

10:54.195 --> 10:55.572
( Chuckles )
Thank you.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.829
I mean you're super young,
so this is weird.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.876
Now you know
how she feels, creep.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.045
( Chuckles )
Yeah, I... Huh.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.498
Wow.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.333
Wow.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.044
STAN: Schlep right up,
ladies and gentlemen,

11:09.252 --> 11:10.504
to see my latest attraction.

11:10.712 --> 11:11.838
All right, the coast is clear.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.219
Now is our chance.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.101
Ha!
Bmgo!

11:21.306 --> 11:22.683
All right, let's see.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.063
BOY: Aw, come on, candy.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.269
Fall. Fall.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.649
Allow me.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.697
You just need to know
a guy on the inside.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.946
Bippity-boop-womp!

11:32.150 --> 11:32.946
Jackpot!

11:33.151 --> 11:34.903
( Qasps )

11:35.111 --> 11:36.078
Thanks, dawg.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.577
You must be
some kind of genius

11:38.781 --> 11:40.749
All right, I think
I've got this thing working

11:40.950 --> 11:42.668
Dipper, Dipper, look.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.587
No way.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.959
Mi precioso,
you keep wandering off.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.794
You don't want to be
late for your big day.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.928
Sorry, Abuelita.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.096
Big day?

11:54.297 --> 11:55.514
This could be
the birthday

11:55.715 --> 11:57.467
where that personal biz
went down.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.349
We could finally find out
why Soos hates his birthday.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.476
All right,
but let's be quick.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.733
KID: I want a piece
of birthday cake!

12:04.933 --> 12:06.935
( Kids giggling )

12:07.143 --> 12:09.441
Who's a handsome birthday boy?

12:09.646 --> 12:11.193
(Sing-song) It's you!

12:11.397 --> 12:13.741
( Giggles ) Soos, you are
such a ladies' man.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.819
They're my cousins,
Grandma. Gross.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.745
I got you a race car cake.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.789
Man, I don't know
why Soos hates his birthdays.

12:19.989 --> 12:20.911
This looks great.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.669
Sorry, dude,
but could you move seats?

12:24.869 --> 12:25.665
That's the seat of honor.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.338
Uh, who's it for?

12:27.538 --> 12:30.132
Oh. Heh.
It's for my dad, actually.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.382
I haven't seen him in, like,
8 years, but he's coming today.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
( Door bell rings )
That must be him!

12:42.929 --> 12:45.808
(inhales, exhales)
All right, Soos, today's the big day.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.938
Be cool.
Be cool.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.063
Postcard for...

12:52.272 --> 12:54.149
Soos.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.368
( Soos reading aloud )

12:59.696 --> 13:01.323
"See you next year for sure.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.124
Dad."

13:03.283 --> 13:05.251
Hey, don't sweat it, cuz.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.498
You'll see him next year.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.957
Ha. Yeah, next year.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.836
I'm gonna go lay down.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.300
You party without me,
dudes.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.630
Wait, what about
your presents?

13:17.839 --> 13:18.840
TOY: <i>Yay-uh.</i>

13:21.884 --> 13:24.433
So that's why
Soos hates his birthday.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.060
It's the day he realized
his dad wasn't coming back.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.144
So how much partying
can fix that?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.443
( Giggles )
Dorks.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.728
Young Robbie.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.284
Ay, Soos' father
is a dead-beat.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.365
( Speaking Spanish )

13:42.530 --> 13:43.452
( clears throat )

13:44.240 --> 13:47.870
Soos, I made you cookies
shaped like dinosaurs.

13:48.077 --> 13:48.873
I don't want cookies.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.125
I want to see Dad again.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.547
And he wants to see you.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.625
He's just...busy.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.755
Busy in New Orleans?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.552
Ay. Yes.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.757
Trust me,
you will feel better one day.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.726
Ohh, this is awful.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.428
We promised Soos
a happy birthday,

14:05.636 --> 14:07.229
but how can we
give him that now?

14:07.430 --> 14:09.432
This goes beyond anything
we know how to fix.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.647
BLENDIN: This way!
Mabel, hide!

14:14.729 --> 14:16.356
They've got to be
around here somewhere.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.819
I think I heard them!

14:18.024 --> 14:20.573
( Bird chirping )
Freeze!

14:20.777 --> 14:22.120
( Crying )

14:22.320 --> 14:24.197
Trace their chrono-signatures.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.579
Man, the sooner I defeat
those kids in Globnar,

14:27.784 --> 14:29.627
the sooner
I can win my time wish.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.625
Tell you what I'd do
if I had a time wish.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.957
Retire early,
spend more time with the kids.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.091
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah
with the kids?!

14:36.292 --> 14:38.841
Don't you know a time wish
can literally do anything?

14:39.003 --> 14:41.802
Any impossible problem solved,
just like that.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.432
I mean,
imagine the possibilities.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.635
Wait, Mabel, that's it,
the time wish.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.520
If we defeat Blendin
in that space battle--

14:47.678 --> 14:48.679
Then we can wish

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
that Soos' dad
came to his 12th birthday.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.692
And Soos' birthdays
would be fixed forever--

14:52.892 --> 14:53.939
all of them!

14:54.143 --> 14:56.521
But do you really think
we can win Globnar?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.231
It's the only chance we have.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.692
Besides, it's for Soos.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.369
He would do the same for us.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.041
Here we are, Blendin.
We surrender.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.826
It's them!
Freeze!

15:10.034 --> 15:11.035
Careful,
they're from the past.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.296
They might have powder muskets
or slap bracelets.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.918
Look, guys,
no tricks this time.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.628
We're ready to challenge you,
okay?

15:16.833 --> 15:19.006
Yes!
Let the Globnar begin.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.589
Prepare for Globnar!!!

15:22.797 --> 15:24.720
( Silence )

15:24.882 --> 15:26.259
Hey, turns out
I can mute him.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.969
Man, I wish
we'd known that earlier.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.975
Initializing.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.893
( Crowd cheering )

15:37.270 --> 15:41.525
Globnar! Globnar!
Globnar! Globnar!

15:51.325 --> 15:52.827
Silence!

15:53.035 --> 15:54.412
Whoo!
Oh, yeah!

15:56.330 --> 15:58.378
That is one big baby.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.256
Welcome, Globnar tributes.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.258
I have
a very important nap to get to,

16:02.462 --> 16:03.805
so let's make this quick.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.136
You each have a chance
to settle your time-feud

16:06.340 --> 16:08.559
through gladiatorial combat.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.557
<i>ROBOT: You will have
until time baby finishes</i>

16:10.720 --> 16:13.143
<i>drinking the cosmic sand
in this hourglass.</i>

16:13.347 --> 16:14.473
[[511

16:14.640 --> 16:15.732
<i>Come on.
It's good for you.</i>

16:15.933 --> 16:16.934
Waah!

16:17.143 --> 16:18.486
Get ready, kids.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.692
When I get that time wish,
you'll wish you were never born.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.774
Or rather,
you'll wish you were born,

16:22.982 --> 16:24.655
because I'm gonna wish
you were never born!

16:24.859 --> 16:26.486
Dream on!
There's two of us.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.162
<i>And</i> we have hair!

16:28.321 --> 16:29.322
Oh--oh, yeah?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.498
Well, I have training!

16:33.451 --> 16:35.499
What do you think I did
in prison all that time?

16:35.703 --> 16:36.499
Uh-oh.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.253
Let the Globnar begin!

16:39.457 --> 16:40.925
( Crowd cheers )

16:41.083 --> 16:42.255
( buzzer )

16:45.296 --> 16:47.594
( roars )

16:48.674 --> 16:49.891
( grunting )

17:03.439 --> 17:04.565
Yeah!

17:09.694 --> 17:11.242
( Roaring )

17:16.285 --> 17:18.753
<i>Globnar!</i>

17:20.915 --> 17:22.166
Very good.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.469
You have escaped
the Cyclocks.

17:24.669 --> 17:27.137
Yes!
Blendin for the almost-win!

17:28.798 --> 17:31.677
There is only one
final challenge for Globnar.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.812
An ancient game,
thousands of years old,

17:35.012 --> 17:38.357
chosen for its exemplification
of pure strategy.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.983
The ancient art of laser tag!

17:44.605 --> 17:47.734
The one who touches
the victory orb first will win.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.786
Laser tag?
Seriously?

17:50.987 --> 17:53.035
Oh, I know it doesn't seem
that challenging now,

17:53.239 --> 17:55.617
but just wait until they
turn on that fog machine.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.826
You'll be done for.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.001
You just wait until you--

17:58.160 --> 17:59.036
<i>MACHINE: Hit.</i>

17:59.203 --> 18:01.126
<i>Hit, hit, hit, hit.</i>

18:01.330 --> 18:02.206
Oh, man.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.632
Mabel, grab the orb!

18:03.833 --> 18:04.880
Got it.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.927
It is finished!

18:12.466 --> 18:13.308
( BurpS )

18:13.509 --> 18:14.806
( cheering )

18:16.095 --> 18:17.472
( bu
:5?“

18:17.680 --> 18:19.523
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

18:19.682 --> 18:22.310
You have made victory
in Globnar.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.236
Before I give you
your time wish,

18:24.437 --> 18:28.032
tell us what fate
do you decide for the loser?

18:28.232 --> 18:29.700
Oh, jeez.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.698
Death!

18:31.902 --> 18:33.154
Mabel.
Sorry.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.698
Got carried away.

18:34.905 --> 18:38.205
So Blendin did try
to wish us out of existence,

18:38.409 --> 18:40.662
but it was kind of our fault
for ruining his life.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.215
Yeah, and he's kind of too sad
to be a real bad guy.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.213
Maybe if we treat him right
in the present,

18:46.417 --> 18:48.010
he'll turn out better
in the future.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.258
Okay, as long as you keep
an eye on him,

18:50.463 --> 18:53.342
we'd like to set Blendin free
and restore his position

18:53.549 --> 18:55.051
at the Time Anomaly
Correction Unit.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.227
And give him pretty hair.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.771
So be it.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.900
What?
You'd do that for me?

19:03.100 --> 19:04.693
I got my job back!

19:04.894 --> 19:06.396
I feel like hugging somebody.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.906
- I can kill you in eight different ways.
- Yes, sir.

19:09.106 --> 19:14.033
Now, children, what is it that
you want for your time wish?

19:14.236 --> 19:17.615
Thank you,
but the wish isn't for us.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.949
<i>NO' ya“?</i>

19:19.158 --> 19:20.831
But then who?

19:21.035 --> 19:24.130
Who is worthy
to receive such power?

19:25.456 --> 19:26.958
Dipper?
Mabel?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.418
Ah, who am I kidding?

19:28.626 --> 19:29.878
I'm not up for this.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.554
Heads, I stay.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.099
Tails, I go make myself
some dinosaur shaped cookies.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.936
( laughter slows down )

19:42.139 --> 19:44.813
Huh. That's unconventional.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.522
BOTH: Soos!
Guys!

19:49.730 --> 19:51.698
We're so sorry
we left you hanging, dude.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.901
We got caught up
in this time travel junk.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.612
And there was a time Cyclops.

19:55.820 --> 19:56.616
<i>And don't forget
about the</i>

19:56.821 --> 19:57.743
time race.
Time race.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.620
But the point is, Soos,

19:59.824 --> 20:01.701
we think we know
how to fix your birthday.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.206
Whoa. Really?

20:03.411 --> 20:06.415
Wait, you guys did
all of that for me?

20:06.622 --> 20:07.748
And that's not all.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.380
Behold your time wish,

20:10.584 --> 20:14.805
the power to alter time, pa
radox-free, in any way you choose.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.342
We think the only thing that can
make you happy is meeting your dad.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.018
But the choice is yours.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.687
You mean, I can finally see
my dad by touching this thing?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.730
And you guys battled
through time and space

20:23.931 --> 20:25.274
just to get this for me?

20:27.935 --> 20:29.687
What are you waiting for,
Soos?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.940
All right.
Here goes nothing.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.949
( Qasps )

20:38.154 --> 20:38.950
Wait, what?
What the...

20:39.155 --> 20:40.281
Bam!
Fixed you up.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.456
Enjfih dudes.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.580
But, Soos, what about
meeting your dad?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.832
Well, birthdays
are supposed to be spent

20:46.036 --> 20:47.288
with the people
who care about you.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.839
But you know what?

20:49.039 --> 20:50.791
That dude didn't care about me
enough to visit me once,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.753
let alone fight monsters through
time and space like you dudes.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.547
I mean, you had a gladiator fight
just to make me happy.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.599
I've been being ridiculous
this whole time.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.642
Whoever my dad was,
he could take a hike.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.896
I know who my family is now,
and it's you dudes.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.394
Thanks for giving me
the best birthday ever.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.192
Are you kidding me?!

21:08.392 --> 21:10.394
Do you have any idea
what you've just wasted?

21:10.561 --> 21:12.655
Do you know how many
have died to get a time wish?

21:12.855 --> 21:14.778
The wars
that were started?

21:14.982 --> 21:15.778
Oh, that's not all,
dudes.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.610
I also wished for
the slice of infinite pizza.

21:17.818 --> 21:18.819
Watch.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.698
And it can do that for,
like, infinity.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.033
( Indistinct )

21:24.200 --> 21:25.702
Phew!
That's a good time wish.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.708
There's still 1O minutes
before laser tag closes.

21:27.912 --> 21:28.708
You dudes want to play?

21:28.913 --> 21:29.880
Yeah.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.291
(giggling )

21:31.499 --> 21:33.593
DIPPER & MABEL:
Happy birthday, Soos.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.841
Whoa.
Thought I heard an explosion.

21:36.003 --> 21:36.799
Whoa, what's this?

21:38.047 --> 21:40.049
Mystery Shack?

21:40.257 --> 21:41.258
That is it!

21:41.467 --> 21:42.684
You are single-handedly

21:42.843 --> 21:45.596
the worst handyman
I've ever seen.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.231
Uh, hey, excuse me, sir.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.980
Hey you, gumdrop,
think you can fix a golf cart?

21:50.184 --> 21:51.686
Well, I don't know if I--

21:51.894 --> 21:52.770
Boom, you're hired.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.821
One size fits all.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.615
Step right up
to the Mystery Shack, folks.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.783
Step right LIP-
