03:09.360 --> 03:10.694
The paramedics,

03:10.728 --> 03:15.728
they called it a seizure
of some kind.

03:15.832 --> 03:20.170
But in truth, I...

03:20.204 --> 03:24.008
I believe
I was responsible.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.110
A month ago,

03:25.143 --> 03:29.514
my theoretical methods
on expanding cerebral capacity

03:29.546 --> 03:33.817
were deemed too extreme
by my superiors.

03:33.850 --> 03:35.286
My funding denied,

03:35.318 --> 03:38.122
I chose to

03:38.155 --> 03:43.155
secretly perform
a trial test...

03:43.800 --> 03:45.896
on myself.

03:45.931 --> 03:49.933
Since then, my headaches
have been increasing.

03:49.933 --> 03:52.604
And... last week,

03:52.637 --> 03:56.073
I started hearing voices.

03:56.106 --> 03:57.474
Tonight...

03:57.508 --> 04:02.508

04:08.085 --> 04:11.956
He had ended lives before.

04:11.990 --> 04:16.461
And he was looking forward
to ending mine.

04:16.494 --> 04:21.098
I... I think
some kind of...

04:21.132 --> 04:25.201
instinct kicked in, and...

04:25.235 --> 04:30.235
And I...
triggered the seizure.

04:30.274 --> 04:33.543
I must admit,
for documentation,

04:33.577 --> 04:37.781
when I silenced his thoughts,

04:37.814 --> 04:40.451
I felt relief.

04:40.485 --> 04:45.485
My migraine...
is all but gone.

is... a success.

[TV static]

05:09.413 --> 05:11.449
I could...

05:11.482 --> 05:16.432
hear Henry's thoughts
in my head.

05:16.721 --> 05:19.656
He had no idea
what was going on.

05:19.690 --> 05:24.490
He was screaming
for it to stop.

05:25.295 --> 05:29.466
He was so scared.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.800
And I was scared, too.

05:34.771 --> 05:38.942
I could feel
everything he felt.

05:38.975 --> 05:40.177
He...

05:40.211 --> 05:44.261
He was... lonely, confused.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Sad.

05:52.189 --> 05:56.959
I wasn't expecting that.

05:56.959 --> 05:59.396
He's not like Cindy...

05:59.430 --> 06:01.831
or even like his father.

06:01.831 --> 06:02.800
Uh... [sighs]

06:02.800 --> 06:07.800
I know what he did
to Yolanda was awful...

06:11.408 --> 06:15.312
but I wanna ask him
to help us.

06:15.346 --> 06:17.482
I know it's a risk...

06:17.483 --> 06:22.516
but if he can read minds,
then he could tell us
who else is in the ISA.

06:25.423 --> 06:29.026
Pat?

06:29.059 --> 06:32.463
What is it?

06:32.495 --> 06:34.966
Our best case scenario

06:35.000 --> 06:37.168
was that the ISA
came to Blue Valley

06:37.201 --> 06:40.704
after they killed
the Justice Society to hide.

06:40.737 --> 06:44.274
To go underground
and disappear.

06:44.307 --> 06:47.144
But if Dr. Ito
is Cindy's father...

06:47.177 --> 06:49.245

06:50.814 --> 06:53.451

06:53.483 --> 06:55.052
According to Beth's goggles,

06:55.052 --> 06:56.053
this man was executed

06:56.053 --> 06:57.988
for war crimes,
like, a hundred years ago.

06:58.023 --> 07:01.291
[Pat] I'm not sure
that it's possible
to kill Dr. Ito.

07:01.324 --> 07:03.728
He experimented
on himself, Court,

07:03.761 --> 07:06.531
until he evolved
into something beyond human.

07:06.564 --> 07:09.800
Like Cindy,
but much, much worse.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.970
He calls himself
"Dragon King."

07:12.002 --> 07:14.471
He's spent his long life
building weapons

07:14.504 --> 07:18.776
designed to kill
tens of thousands.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.444
How do you know
Dr. Ito is alive,

07:20.478 --> 07:22.180
but Beth's goggles don't?

07:22.180 --> 07:25.983

of a different team
when we fought Dr. Ito.

This was before
we joined the JSA.

[Courtney] You were part
of another team?

07:30.187 --> 07:33.490

The Seven Soldiers of Victory.

07:33.524 --> 07:35.291

There's Robin Hood,

07:35.326 --> 07:37.694
and a knight.

07:37.694 --> 07:39.029
And there were
eight of you, Pat.

07:39.029 --> 07:43.166
Yeah, we always argued
about the name.

07:43.199 --> 07:45.636

had their struggles.

never got the credit

At their very core...

16:32.263 --> 16:34.097
People are monsters.

16:34.130 --> 16:35.634
[TV scratching]

16:35.667 --> 16:38.869
-[TV amplifier feedback]
-I hate them.

16:38.903 --> 16:40.370
[TV static]

16:40.404 --> 16:42.005
[footsteps approaching]

16:42.038 --> 16:43.841
[door knob rattles]

16:43.874 --> 16:45.375
[keys jangling]

16:45.409 --> 16:48.111
[high-pitched ringing]

16:48.145 --> 16:52.917
[door opening]

16:52.950 --> 16:55.720
[maid] Henry?

16:55.754 --> 16:59.956
-[Henry sighing]
-[maid] I worry about him.

16:59.990 --> 17:03.726
I'm fine. Thanks.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.130
A man called. A lawyer.

17:06.163 --> 17:08.266
He wanted to talk with you
about your father.

17:08.298 --> 17:13.298
[thinking] He'd probably
be better off if he died.

17:13.671 --> 17:16.406
Shut up.

17:16.441 --> 17:17.942
[high-pitched ringing]

17:17.974 --> 17:19.042
[groans]

17:19.076 --> 17:20.076
[Dr. King] Henry.

17:20.111 --> 17:21.744
[breathing heavily]

17:21.778 --> 17:23.079
Dad?

17:23.114 --> 17:27.218
Henry?

17:27.250 --> 17:30.086
Get out of my way.

17:30.086 --> 17:32.455
[woman] You said you had news.

17:32.489 --> 17:33.538
Not me.

17:39.997 --> 17:41.532
"Dragon King."

17:41.566 --> 17:44.701
[Dr. Ito]
It's Dr. Ito, please.

17:44.734 --> 17:46.436
Good afternoon, everyone.

17:46.471 --> 17:48.239
What a wonderful day.

17:48.271 --> 17:50.375
Oh, did you make it
out of the dungeon today?

17:50.375 --> 17:55.313
[laughing mockingly]

17:55.346 --> 17:58.346
[Dr. Ito] May I sit?

18:01.018 --> 18:02.220
Of course.

18:02.220 --> 18:03.221
Please.

18:03.253 --> 18:04.753
Thank you.

18:14.431 --> 18:15.666
Hmm.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.869
I know we've had
our conflicts in the past,

18:18.903 --> 18:23.473
but be assured, I am your ally
in Project: New America.

18:23.508 --> 18:26.943
Why don't you tell them
the news, Dr. Ito?

18:26.977 --> 18:31.916
Yes.

18:31.950 --> 18:35.286
We no longer need to wait
for Brainwave to awaken.

18:35.318 --> 18:38.423
His son, Henry,
is a telepath.

18:38.455 --> 18:42.259
The amplifier will be complete
within the week.

18:42.292 --> 18:44.327
Once it is, we can funnel

18:44.362 --> 18:46.631
Henry's telepathic abilities
through it,

18:46.663 --> 18:49.867
broadcasting them
across six states,

18:49.901 --> 18:54.901
taking control of
ever fully developed mind
within them.

18:55.071 --> 18:56.740
Carving out...

18:56.740 --> 18:59.609
a new America.

18:59.643 --> 19:02.542
Our America.

19:13.958 --> 19:16.294
Jordan? Are you okay?

19:16.326 --> 19:20.597
Yeah. Barbara.
Please, come in.

19:20.632 --> 19:22.567
I just... I'm sorry
for interrupting.

19:22.567 --> 19:26.805
I wanted to apologize in person
for leaving you in Oakville.

19:26.837 --> 19:28.605
Your daughter
was in an accident.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.941
You have nothing
to apologize for.

19:30.974 --> 19:32.809
How is, uh... Courtney?

19:32.843 --> 19:34.278
Yeah, better. Thanks.

19:34.311 --> 19:37.011
Good. That's good.

19:42.353 --> 19:45.257
Are you sure you're okay?

19:45.289 --> 19:48.660
I just finished a project
I've been working on
for some years.

19:48.692 --> 19:50.059
It took me
all around the globe.

19:50.059 --> 19:51.362
To London, Tokyo,

19:51.394 --> 19:53.097
all over the States.

19:53.131 --> 19:56.968
But it also cost me
quite a bit of time
away from my son.

19:57.001 --> 19:58.803
Given everything I sacrificed,
I was hoping,

19:58.836 --> 20:01.569
once it was complete,
I would feel...

20:01.569 --> 20:04.641
a sense of accomplishment.

20:04.674 --> 20:08.545
But I don't.

20:08.578 --> 20:09.881
Still.

20:09.881 --> 20:11.415
It's nothing the new project
won't fix,

20:11.415 --> 20:15.818
or some time with my family.

20:15.853 --> 20:17.387
Christine, she would

20:17.422 --> 20:20.625
make a big dinner
when I returned from a trip.

20:20.625 --> 20:25.096
It'd remind me
what I was working for.

20:25.128 --> 20:27.131
Thanks again
for stopping by.

20:27.131 --> 20:28.131
Yeah.

20:32.303 --> 20:33.872
Jordan?

20:33.904 --> 20:38.904
What are you and your family
doing tonight?

20:41.445 --> 20:42.445
[monitor beeping]

20:42.446 --> 20:44.382
[high-pitched ringing]

20:44.414 --> 20:46.151
[woman 1]
How long's it gonna take?

20:46.151 --> 20:50.153
[man 1] I can't believe
I'm missing my favorite show.
[woman 2] It hurts.

20:50.186 --> 20:51.355
[man 2] Why me?

20:51.388 --> 20:53.258
[groans]

20:53.258 --> 20:56.394
[man 3] These meds aren't
working. Nothing's working.
[woman 3] I'm scared.

20:56.426 --> 20:58.962
[man 4] I hope she dies soon.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.332
I'll get the house.

21:01.365 --> 21:03.433
Then I get the car, too.

21:03.468 --> 21:07.203
[indistinct conversations]

21:07.238 --> 21:10.173
[monitor beeping]

21:10.207 --> 21:13.777
Dad?

21:13.810 --> 21:16.361
Dad, I heard you.

21:19.817 --> 21:22.921
Did I inherit this
from you?

21:22.921 --> 21:27.921
From whatever
you did to yourself?

21:31.596 --> 21:32.830
Are you trying to...

21:32.864 --> 21:35.965
Are you trying
to talk to me?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.837
Do you need my help?

21:40.871 --> 21:43.441
Can I help you?

21:43.473 --> 21:48.473
[telepathically]
Can you hear me, Dad?

21:49.346 --> 21:50.547
[grunts]

21:56.819 --> 21:58.170
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:07.565 --> 22:12.565
[Doctor] I never
liked Dr. King.

22:16.374 --> 22:18.910
He's been in here for months.

22:18.942 --> 22:22.015
They should terminate
life support.

22:34.224 --> 22:37.327
You're right, Dad.

22:37.361 --> 22:40.361
People are monsters.

22:51.141 --> 22:53.143
[door opens]

22:53.176 --> 22:54.877
[Beth] Mr. Dugan?

22:54.877 --> 22:56.247
Hey.

22:56.279 --> 22:58.481
Where's Yolanda?

22:58.516 --> 22:59.517
I texted her.

22:59.549 --> 23:00.951
She's pissed off.

23:00.984 --> 23:03.688
Since Courtney's gonna try
and recruit Henry.

23:03.721 --> 23:07.156
Why would you even let
Court talk to Henry?

23:07.157 --> 23:10.059
It is a classic
anti-Pat plan.

23:10.094 --> 23:12.763
Well, you know...

23:12.797 --> 23:14.865
she believed in you
when no one else did.

23:14.898 --> 23:18.402
I've never sent photos
of some girl around.

23:18.435 --> 23:21.838
What are we
doing here anyway?

23:21.872 --> 23:23.406
Well...

23:23.441 --> 23:25.609
Court went into
a tunnel at school.

23:25.643 --> 23:28.613
Beth found another passage
in Cindy's basement.

23:28.613 --> 23:30.214
I want to know
if there's a connection.

23:30.248 --> 23:32.583
So you want
to check and see
if there's some kind

23:32.616 --> 23:34.286
of tunnel network
under Blue Valley?

23:34.318 --> 23:39.124
Yeah. And I'm hoping the answer
might be in one of these.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.292
And maybe Beth's goggles
can help us piece it
all together.

23:42.292 --> 23:43.559
I can try.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.230
This is why
you called us here?

23:46.262 --> 23:48.164
To look through old books?

23:48.199 --> 23:49.366
[Pat] Planning.

23:49.366 --> 23:50.601
Preparing.

23:50.634 --> 23:51.970
Doing the work.

23:52.002 --> 23:54.105
You want to be
a superhero, Rick?

23:54.138 --> 23:58.409
Well, buddy, sometimes
this is exactly what it takes.

23:58.442 --> 23:59.711
You're not gonna
stay to help?

23:59.743 --> 24:04.700
I got some family business
to take care of.

24:07.151 --> 24:10.555
Let's get started.

24:10.587 --> 24:12.223
You and Chuck
got it covered.

24:12.257 --> 24:15.291
I'm working
on cracking the code
to my dad's journal.

24:15.292 --> 24:17.694
But Mr. Dugan
gave us instructions,
we need to--

24:17.729 --> 24:20.731
My parents died
for a reason, Beth.

24:20.765 --> 24:25.134
That reason isn't here.

24:25.169 --> 24:28.105
[monitor beeping]

24:28.138 --> 24:31.974
[Courtney] Why do hospitals
always smell like this?

24:32.009 --> 24:33.209
Henry...

24:37.615 --> 24:38.715
What do you want?

24:38.750 --> 24:41.184
[Courtney]
I don't wanna hurt you.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.119
Like I did your dad.

24:43.153 --> 24:44.654
[buzzing]

24:44.689 --> 24:46.723
You hurt my dad?

24:46.758 --> 24:49.393
No. I mean...

24:49.393 --> 24:50.393
I wasn't thinking--

24:50.393 --> 24:51.394
It wasn't a seizure.

24:51.429 --> 24:53.864
-[high-pitched ringing]
-It was you.

24:53.864 --> 24:54.798
[grunts]

24:54.798 --> 24:56.500
You put him here.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.501
Her threatened
to kill my mom.

24:58.536 --> 24:59.604
He was going to kill me.

24:59.636 --> 25:01.204
So you fried his brain.

25:01.204 --> 25:04.387
It wasn't on purpose.

25:13.183 --> 25:14.751
Did you know your dad
was a part of--

25:14.786 --> 25:19.286
The Injustice Society.
I know.

25:20.391 --> 25:21.424
What all do you know?

25:21.459 --> 25:24.161
[high-pitched ringing]

25:24.193 --> 25:27.344
I know what you know.

25:31.367 --> 25:33.371
Help me know more.

25:33.404 --> 25:36.307
Help us find out who else
is in the Injustice Society.

25:36.340 --> 25:40.944
Then we can stop them
from killing anyone else.

25:40.979 --> 25:44.682
You know they kill people,
right, Henry?

25:44.714 --> 25:47.865
Joey Zarick. His dad.

25:51.221 --> 25:53.691
My dad.

25:53.723 --> 25:57.223
Yeah, well,
maybe they all deserved it.

26:00.530 --> 26:02.933
Joey deserved it?

26:02.967 --> 26:07.738
Do you really believe that?

26:07.771 --> 26:11.240
He was a nice kid.

26:11.275 --> 26:13.176
Yeah.

26:13.210 --> 26:14.259
He was.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.567
Why aren't you?

26:26.290 --> 26:31.290
Do you know what it's like
to be able to hear
everyone's thoughts?

26:31.595 --> 26:34.798
It's hell on earth.

26:34.832 --> 26:38.068
You think I'm a jerk?

26:38.103 --> 26:43.103
Well, trust me,
everyone else is worse.

26:43.574 --> 26:46.277
If my dad hurt anyone...

26:46.309 --> 26:49.780
he had a reason to.

26:49.814 --> 26:53.384
People are monsters.

26:53.416 --> 26:56.287
Deep down, they're ugly,

26:56.319 --> 26:59.323
and greedy, and hateful,

26:59.355 --> 27:02.593
and twisted.

27:02.626 --> 27:07.265
That's the truth.

27:07.298 --> 27:11.102
Life isn't that black
and white, Henry.

27:11.135 --> 27:15.105
People can be bad,
but people can be good, too.

27:15.140 --> 27:19.277
And kind, and compassionate.

27:19.310 --> 27:21.045
Maybe some of
the thoughts you read,

27:21.078 --> 27:24.781
maybe some of them are bad.

27:24.816 --> 27:28.252
I mean, sometimes we're hurting
or we're afraid,

27:28.286 --> 27:32.722
and we think awful,
awful things.

27:32.757 --> 27:36.259
Have you tried looking
a little deeper?

27:36.260 --> 27:41.260
I bet you'd find
something better.

27:41.798 --> 27:46.503
I really doubt it.

27:46.537 --> 27:49.007
Behind the pain and the fear,

27:49.007 --> 27:52.777
it's all about love.

27:52.809 --> 27:55.346
People want to love,

27:55.378 --> 27:57.682
and be loved.

27:57.714 --> 28:01.719
I think you do, too.

28:01.751 --> 28:05.690
What makes you think that?

28:05.722 --> 28:09.961
Look where you are.

28:09.993 --> 28:13.631
Yolanda told me the way
your father treats you...

28:13.663 --> 28:18.001
and you're still
at his side.

28:18.001 --> 28:19.603
I don't know
what it must've been like

28:19.636 --> 28:22.339
growing up with him
as a father.

28:22.374 --> 28:25.476
I can't imagine
what he did to you.

28:25.509 --> 28:27.178
[high-pitched ringing]

28:27.211 --> 28:32.211
-[objects clattering]
-Get out of here!

28:33.483 --> 28:34.652
Okay, okay.

28:34.684 --> 28:37.384
[clattering stops]

28:43.027 --> 28:48.027
I know deep down
you wanna do the right thing.

28:48.132 --> 28:53.132
Come talk to me
when you're ready.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.017
Hey, honey? What's going on?

29:06.017 --> 29:08.618
Hi, honey,
I'm making family dinner.

29:08.618 --> 29:09.953
And, normally,
I could handle this,

29:09.953 --> 29:11.521
but it's for eight.

29:11.555 --> 29:12.690
-Eight?
-Yes.

29:12.690 --> 29:14.092
-[gasps] The chicken!
-[water sizzling]

29:14.092 --> 29:16.126
-What, you're boiling chicken?
-Yeah.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.961
Barb, if I had known
you had invited people,

29:17.994 --> 29:20.198
I could've done the cooking.

29:20.230 --> 29:21.965
I know, honey,
but you've been so busy

29:21.999 --> 29:24.602
taking care of the kids,
and fixing your car,

29:24.634 --> 29:26.537
and I just didn't
wanna bother you.

29:26.569 --> 29:28.571
Okay.

29:28.605 --> 29:30.208
I got this, okay?
Come here.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.611
Come on, it's okay. [chuckles]

29:32.644 --> 29:34.712
-But I need to talk to you
about something, okay?
-Hmm.

29:34.746 --> 29:37.013
Something important
that I should've talked
to you about

29:37.048 --> 29:39.049
long time ago, okay?

29:39.083 --> 29:40.652
-[Courtney] Pat's right.
-Hmm?

29:40.684 --> 29:44.888
-We need to tell you something.
-[Barbara] What?

29:44.922 --> 29:46.057
I failed the history test.

29:46.057 --> 29:47.057
-No.
-You what?

29:47.057 --> 29:48.726
No, she didn't.
She's joking.

29:48.759 --> 29:50.094
-Okay?
-[doorbell chiming]

29:50.094 --> 29:51.662
[gasps] Oh. They're here.
Can you get the door, please?

29:51.662 --> 29:53.297
-Yeah.
-Pat's gonna help save me.

29:53.297 --> 29:54.231
Yep. I've got it.

29:54.231 --> 29:57.801
Okay, let me put
some of this in here.

29:57.835 --> 29:59.069
Don't say a word.

29:59.103 --> 30:00.805
[whispers] No more lying.

30:00.837 --> 30:02.337
Hey! Psst!

30:11.347 --> 30:12.615
Cameron?

30:12.650 --> 30:14.451
Hi, Court.

30:14.484 --> 30:16.487
Uh...

30:16.487 --> 30:19.723
Come in.

30:19.757 --> 30:20.790
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:20.790 --> 30:21.959
[Courtney chuckles nervously]

30:21.959 --> 30:23.560
You must be Barbara's
daughter, Courtney.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.627
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:24.662 --> 30:26.462
I'm Jordan Mahkent.

30:26.497 --> 30:29.166
-Oh.
-Oh.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.369
-It's nice to meet you.
-You too.

30:32.403 --> 30:34.439
[woman] We heard
about the accident.

30:34.471 --> 30:38.011
-You poor thing.
-[Courtney] Oh, I'm fine.

30:53.423 --> 30:54.624
[grunts]

31:05.635 --> 31:07.704
[high-pitched ringing]

31:07.738 --> 31:08.838
Yolanda?

31:08.873 --> 31:12.876
Stay away from Courtney
and her family.

31:12.910 --> 31:14.979
She needs to stay
away from me!

31:15.011 --> 31:18.915
She thinks your soul is
worth saving.

31:18.950 --> 31:22.385
I know it isn't.

31:22.419 --> 31:24.055
[exhales sharply]

31:24.087 --> 31:25.757
I should kill you.

31:25.790 --> 31:29.727
You really think I should die
for what I did to you?

31:29.759 --> 31:31.895
You can read thoughts.

31:31.929 --> 31:33.464
Read mine.

31:33.464 --> 31:34.865
[Yolanda]
I can slash you right now,

31:34.865 --> 31:38.236
and watch you bleed
to death, Henry.

31:38.236 --> 31:39.971
I'll do it if you come
near me or my friends,

31:39.971 --> 31:41.105
do you understand?

31:41.138 --> 31:43.907
[breathing heavily]

31:43.941 --> 31:46.844
[Yolanda] You betrayed me.

31:46.876 --> 31:51.876
I trusted you.
I loved you.

31:54.451 --> 31:55.519
Yolanda...

31:55.551 --> 31:58.251
Stay away from us!

32:08.065 --> 32:10.268
Well, this all smells
incredible, Pat.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.336
Chicken and dumplings.

32:11.368 --> 32:13.872
It's, uh,
old Dugan family tradition.

32:13.872 --> 32:17.008
Well, we actually have
a family tradition ourselves,
if you don't mind.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.542
A Norwegian grace.

32:18.576 --> 32:21.945
Oh, please.
That'd be wonderful.

32:21.979 --> 32:24.078
[in Norwegian]

32:37.194 --> 32:38.863
Don't look at me.
I studied French.

32:38.895 --> 32:40.395
[laughter]

32:46.703 --> 32:48.739
[goggles beeping]

32:48.739 --> 32:49.740
[Beth] Rick?

32:49.772 --> 32:51.542
I found something.

32:51.576 --> 32:54.211
Blue Valley
was settled in 1876

32:54.244 --> 32:56.279
by a group of Freemasons
who called themselves

32:56.314 --> 32:58.115
"The Other Founding Fathers."

32:58.148 --> 32:59.616
They came here
to build a community

32:59.651 --> 33:01.786
free of interference
from the outside.

33:01.819 --> 33:05.757
You think some old
separatist freaks
built those tunnels?

33:05.789 --> 33:10.260
It explains
why the Injustice Society
chose our town.

33:10.294 --> 33:13.130
They can do whatever
they want in secret...

33:13.163 --> 33:14.898
hidden...

33:14.932 --> 33:19.281
right underneath Blue Valley.

33:27.912 --> 33:29.314
So, Courtney...

33:29.346 --> 33:32.349
Cameron tells me
that you're quite the gymnast.

33:32.383 --> 33:33.917
Uh... [chuckles nervously]

33:33.951 --> 33:36.153
I... was.

33:36.186 --> 33:38.923
In Valley Village,
she was the best on the team.

33:38.955 --> 33:41.459
-Oh, wow. Really?
-[Barbara] Mm-hmm.

33:41.492 --> 33:43.394
I've always admired athletes.

33:43.428 --> 33:46.096
I hear you're quite
the artist, Cameron.

33:46.130 --> 33:48.065
What kind?

33:48.098 --> 33:50.034
Uh, paints mostly.

33:50.067 --> 33:51.734
Like his mother.

33:51.769 --> 33:54.338
[in Norwegian]

33:54.372 --> 33:55.673
So how about you, Pat?

33:55.707 --> 33:58.542
I hear you run the old garage
off Main Street?

33:58.576 --> 34:01.211
Yeah, I mostly focus
on classic cars,

34:01.244 --> 34:04.048
but, uh, you know,
in a small town like this,

34:04.080 --> 34:06.150
I take whatever work
comes my way.

34:06.150 --> 34:07.785
I guess you could
do your work anywhere, right?

34:07.785 --> 34:09.219
So, why move to Blue Valley,

34:09.253 --> 34:12.023
if you don't mind me asking?

34:12.023 --> 34:14.025
No. Uh...

34:14.025 --> 34:15.393
Well...

34:15.425 --> 34:17.494
The pace, the people.

34:17.528 --> 34:20.630
And, uh, Barbara
of course grew up here, so...

34:20.664 --> 34:21.800
[Jordan] Right.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.735
Growing up in the cornfields,
and going to the theater,

34:23.735 --> 34:26.769
and living
the perfect American life.

34:26.769 --> 34:27.769
Mmm...

34:27.769 --> 34:31.141
It was not perfect, trust me.
Not back then.

34:31.175 --> 34:34.177
Uh, Blue Valley's
not perfect now, Mom.

34:34.211 --> 34:35.746
Oh, it's getting there.

34:35.746 --> 34:38.315
Yeah, Blue Valley's
going to be an example
of a better America

34:38.349 --> 34:41.518
built on the most important
building block of all...

34:41.518 --> 34:42.485
families.

34:42.485 --> 34:43.621
Hmm.

34:43.655 --> 34:47.824
If only everyone
felt the the same way
as us, huh?

34:47.858 --> 34:48.858
[speaking Norwegian]

34:52.500 --> 34:54.130
[Jordan] Well, if it's okay,
I'm gonna have some more.

34:54.130 --> 34:57.335
This is delicious.

34:57.335 --> 34:59.670
Hey, Dad. Chicken dumplings
are gone. [clears throat]

34:59.702 --> 35:01.739
I see that.

35:01.773 --> 35:04.440
Sorry, Jordan,
let me grab you some more.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.309
No. I...
I've got it.

35:06.344 --> 35:08.012
Okay. Well, thank you.

35:08.045 --> 35:09.547
Excuse me.

35:09.547 --> 35:11.215
You're gonna have to give me
that recipe, though.

35:11.215 --> 35:13.164
That is good.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.858
-[sizzling]
-Ooh!

35:21.891 --> 35:24.141
[groans softly]

35:33.471 --> 35:34.972
Ah, fantastic. Thank you.

35:35.005 --> 35:36.407
Uh, let me
move these for you.

35:36.440 --> 35:38.443
-Yes.
-Thank you, Courtney.

35:38.476 --> 35:39.844
-[Buddy barking]
-Oh!

35:39.878 --> 35:42.480
-Hey! Buddy boy!
-Mike, don't feed him
at the table.

35:42.512 --> 35:45.248
-[Mike] He's gotta eat.
-[Pat] Mike, not at the table.

35:45.282 --> 35:46.650
[Barbara] Down, Buddy!

35:46.650 --> 35:47.619
Mike!

35:47.619 --> 35:50.086
[Pat] Get down, Buddy.
Come on, let's go.

35:50.121 --> 35:51.688
-Sorry. [chuckles]
-Wow!

35:51.722 --> 35:54.291
-He's a handful, huh?
-[Pat chuckles] Yeah.

35:54.324 --> 35:57.775
I love you, too, buddy.

36:01.798 --> 36:04.101
Pat! Uh...

36:04.135 --> 36:07.271
[stutters] I left something
in the oven
and it's gonna burn.

36:07.304 --> 36:08.672
-Need a hand?
-Yes!

36:08.704 --> 36:11.775
Okay. Excuse me.

36:11.775 --> 36:12.677
[breathing heavily]

36:12.677 --> 36:14.978
[Jordan] I hope
that's not our dessert.

36:15.012 --> 36:18.315
-[laughter]
-[Barbara] Yeah.

36:18.349 --> 36:20.818
[sighs]

36:20.851 --> 36:23.219
There's nothing there.

36:23.253 --> 36:25.688
I think Jordan is Icicle.

36:25.722 --> 36:29.094
What?

36:29.126 --> 36:32.996
The plate was scalding hot,
and he touched it,
and he was fine.

36:33.030 --> 36:37.380
What, he touched a hot plate?

36:39.003 --> 36:40.003
I don't know.

36:40.003 --> 36:44.353
Jordan Mahkent?
Are you sure?

36:48.612 --> 36:51.981
If Jordan is one of them,
does that mean Cameron is, too?

36:52.016 --> 36:54.717
Like Cindy?

36:54.751 --> 36:56.702
I don't know.

37:06.563 --> 37:08.331
[speaking Norwegian]

37:08.365 --> 37:11.365
[speaking Norwegian]

37:17.141 --> 37:19.043
Is something wrong?

37:19.076 --> 37:20.112
No. [chuckles nervously]

37:20.144 --> 37:23.614
I just always make this face
when I eat too much.

37:23.648 --> 37:28.351
It was really great
to see you.

37:28.385 --> 37:30.853
Hopefully, we can, uh...

37:30.887 --> 37:33.224
do something soon?

37:33.257 --> 37:34.625
[nervously] Uh...

37:34.657 --> 37:37.027
Sure.

37:37.061 --> 37:38.829
Okay.

37:38.862 --> 37:40.811
-Well...
-Oh.

37:44.534 --> 37:47.170
-Bye.
-Bye.

37:47.204 --> 37:49.974
[Jordan] Courtney.

37:50.007 --> 37:55.007
You do know why
I was really here, don't you?

37:55.679 --> 37:59.730
Why do you think, Courtney?

38:00.952 --> 38:05.523
Because I had to meet the girl
my son has been talking
so much about.

38:05.556 --> 38:08.358
And I approve.

38:08.391 --> 38:10.695
Thank you again
for your hospitality.

38:10.728 --> 38:14.628
Sure. [chuckles nervously]

38:25.309 --> 38:29.313
[Pat] Court!

38:29.347 --> 38:32.516
[whirring]

38:32.550 --> 38:34.918
What do you think
you're doing?

38:34.952 --> 38:37.199
What if we use
the Staff to help prove

38:37.199 --> 38:38.623
that Jordan Mahkent is Icicle?

38:38.655 --> 38:41.090
Maybe it can recognize
his scent.

38:41.125 --> 38:42.726
Or... energy?

38:42.760 --> 38:44.494
We're not doing
anything else

38:44.528 --> 38:46.530
until we tell
your mother everything.

38:46.563 --> 38:50.014
[Barbara] What is that?

38:52.168 --> 38:55.005
[shrieks]

38:55.039 --> 38:58.041
What the hell is that?

38:58.074 --> 39:00.244
It's, uh...

39:00.277 --> 39:02.827
[monitor beeping]

39:09.452 --> 39:11.755
-[Dr. Green] Excuse me, Henry?
-[door closes]

39:11.789 --> 39:13.958
Your housekeeper told me
I'd find you here.

39:13.992 --> 39:18.563
I'm Mr. Green.
Your father's attorney.

39:18.596 --> 39:20.965
I'm sorry to meet you
under these circumstances.

39:20.998 --> 39:22.900
Your father left
strict instructions

39:22.934 --> 39:25.869
that if he were
to ever befall
a tragedy like this,

39:25.903 --> 39:29.907
incapacitated, unlikely
to regain brain function...

39:29.940 --> 39:33.777
his life support
would only carry on
for a limited time.

39:33.800 --> 39:37.114
And I'm afraid that time
is soon coming to an end.

39:37.148 --> 39:40.117
[Green] I should've eaten
on the way here.

39:40.150 --> 39:41.719
What?

39:41.753 --> 39:45.822
I've prepared some paperwork
I'd like to discuss with you.

39:45.856 --> 39:47.458
[Green] I need his signature.

39:47.490 --> 39:49.527
I need this money.

39:49.559 --> 39:53.864
[high-pitched ringing]

39:53.896 --> 39:55.365
You're lying.

39:55.398 --> 39:58.670
Excuse me?

39:58.702 --> 40:01.172
[Green] He knows.
I'm a terrible liar.

40:01.206 --> 40:04.509
[breathing heavily]
You faked those papers,
didn't you?

40:04.541 --> 40:06.844
Or something.

40:06.878 --> 40:09.179
You just want to take
my dad's money.

40:09.213 --> 40:10.213
[sighs]

40:10.246 --> 40:12.416
I'm sorry, but no.

40:12.449 --> 40:14.251
I've already got
the State's signature.

40:14.251 --> 40:15.251
[high-pitched ringing]

40:15.251 --> 40:16.219
I know this is hard, but--

40:16.219 --> 40:18.956
You stay away from my dad!

40:18.989 --> 40:20.489
[groaning]

40:31.335 --> 40:34.034
[Dr. King] Junior?

40:38.675 --> 40:40.110
What's going on?
