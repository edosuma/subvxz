No.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.283
It's ok, Dexter.

04:49.316 --> 04:51.383
Your problem
isn't scientifical,

04:51.416 --> 04:53.216
it's astrological.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.383
Astrological?

04:54.416 --> 04:58.133
Yes. You see,
Dexter, everyone
has a star sign.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.116
Yours is capricorn,

05:00.150 --> 05:01.300
and mine is cancer,

05:01.333 --> 05:04.350
and every sign
has a ruling planet.

05:04.383 --> 05:06.066
Yours is saturn.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.133
Normally, you receive
powerful rays
from saturn's energy,

05:08.166 --> 05:10.483
which helps you be good
at science and stuff.

05:11.016 --> 05:14.283
But today is
the celestial lunation.

05:14.316 --> 05:15.400
What's that?

05:15.433 --> 05:19.150
It's where
the moon passes
in front of saturn,

05:19.183 --> 05:20.466
blocking
its powerful rays.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.033
Hey, I need
those rays,
mister moon!

05:24.066 --> 05:27.216

stop it, Dexter.
