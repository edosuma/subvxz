Me and Randy don't usually
set the alarm,

00:04.505 --> 00:07.841
but today was
our first day of work.

00:07.908 --> 00:11.845
Rise and shine.
Hands off... mine!
Randy, hands off mine!

Recently I added
somethin' to my list.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.785
Number 273-- kept myself
from bein' an adult.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.521
[ Earl Narrating ]
First thing I did
was get a G.E.D.,

00:20.588 --> 00:22.990
and the next step
was findin' a job.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.193
Turns out it was easy
to find a job.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.561
The hard part was findin' one
we'd want to keep.

00:27.628 --> 00:31.099
Well, the crane's broken.
Guess we're usin' the saw.

But today was lookin'
a little more promising.

00:38.339 --> 00:41.309
Man, these things smell clean,
but they're a little bit itchy.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.145
I wish I would've
left my underwear on.

00:44.212 --> 00:47.448
Nice! Wear those colors
with pride.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.090
And before
we unload a truck,

00:56.157 --> 00:59.393
for good luck,
everybody rubs
my mother's bust.

Show 'em the ropes.
Will do, Mr. Waadt.

01:15.943 --> 01:19.580
Well, all right.
Trucks come in and out
of here all day long.

Truck comes in, you unload it.
Truck goes out, you load it.

Havin' a job isn't the most
glamorous way to spend your day,

but it felt good bein'
a part of the workforce.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.401
Me and Randy
were real nine-to-fivers.

01:40.468 --> 01:43.137
Hey, Earl. Someone said
Wednesday is "Hump Day."

01:43.204 --> 01:47.308
I haven't seen any ladies here,
so I'll watch your back
and you watch mine.

little dose of reality.

You are such a sweet son,
takin' your mama out shoppin'

Yeah, she's my wife.
Um, I'll meet you inside?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.700
Yuck.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.569
I'm sorry. It's just
she's so damn old.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.539
Well, that certainly
is a lot of punch.

No, it's for me.
They're havin' a sale.

I love the green stuff.
Darnell won't touch it.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.183
I like the orange.
Green gives me the hiccups.

All that's for you?
You do realize your trial
starts next week, right?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.889
Not much of a trial.
I mean, my witness is dead.

02:35.956 --> 02:39.327
They have other evidence, Joy.
This trial could go either way.

02:39.393 --> 02:42.230
You have to prepare
yourself for that.

I don't know if I would
be buying that much punch.

02:48.669 --> 02:52.139
Want me to go get your
money back for the punch?
I can't!

02:52.206 --> 02:55.376
I already spit my gum into
the receipt, just like I did
with the entertainment unit,

02:55.443 --> 02:58.979
which forced me to steal
the truck and is the reason why
I'm facing life in prison.

Swear to God,
if Fruit Stripe just kept its
damn flavor a little longer,

be in this mess.

[ Earl Narrating ] Me and Randy
quickly learned that our new job
came with perks.

They give you
a store credit card,
a week's vacation,

03:13.227 --> 03:17.398
and anything
you put in your 401(k),
the company will match it.

I'm gonna put a puppy
in mine.

we got to spend 15 minutes...

of the snack machines.

We're the perfect
cookie-eatin' team.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.577
We used to be good
with gum too.

When we were kids,
Earl'd soften it up,
and I'd blow the bubbles.

Hey, guys, A-9's empty.
I wonder what they're
gonna put in there.

Well, I hope they don't waste
valuable real estate
with stamps again.

03:38.786 --> 03:42.690
Or that Arm & Hammer stuff. Mom
always had that in the fridge,
and it was a terrible snack.

No matter how much you eat,
it doesn't fill you up.

After four hours of box foldin'
and talkin' snacks,

You know, one time
I pushed D-5, and two bags
of chips came out.

But then
one time I pushed it,
and no chips came out.

of that story, you know,
so it has a happy ending.

Well, first, you get one

Then you put
too much hair gel in,
which is good...

to shove your head
up your own rump.

of these braided belts?
