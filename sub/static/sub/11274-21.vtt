00:02.085 --> 00:05.255
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.056 --> 00:09.059
Well, I'm out of here, I guess.

00:09.059 --> 00:11.561
Going to stop over at the health club.

00:13.563 --> 00:15.065
You belong to a health club?

00:15.065 --> 00:17.567
Yeah, yeah. Vera gave me a
membership for my birthday.

00:17.567 --> 00:20.937
It's, uh, real subtle, huh?

00:20.937 --> 00:22.188
You-You actually go there and work out?

00:22.188 --> 00:25.692
Yeah. I try to do, uh, about
25 in the pool every day.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.609
Laps?

00:26.609 --> 00:28.111
Cannonballs.

00:30.580 --> 00:34.534
(piano plays)

00:34.918 --> 00:36.920
? Making your way in the world today ?

00:36.920 --> 00:39.923
? Takes everything you've got ?

00:39.923 --> 00:42.926
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

00:42.926 --> 00:46.429
? Sure would help a lot ?

00:46.429 --> 00:52.218
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

00:52.218 --> 00:54.220
? Sometimes you want to go ?

00:54.220 --> 00:59.726
? Where everybody knows your name ?

00:59.726 --> 01:04.230
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:04.230 --> 01:06.733
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:06.733 --> 01:09.235
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:09.235 --> 01:14.741
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:14.741 --> 01:17.243
? You want to go where people know ?

01:17.243 --> 01:19.746
? People are all the same ?

01:19.746 --> 01:24.751
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

01:41.568 --> 01:44.370
Uh, great, Miss Harville, thanks.

01:44.370 --> 01:45.872
Hot dog!

01:45.872 --> 01:46.873
What's up?

01:46.873 --> 01:48.792
They just delivered my new mattress.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.161
Finally, a decent night's rest.

01:51.161 --> 01:52.378
Now all I got to do

01:52.378 --> 01:54.464
is figure out what to
do with my old mattress.

01:54.464 --> 01:55.799
Any suggestions?

01:55.799 --> 01:58.751
Well, mine's in the Smithsonian.

02:00.637 --> 02:02.422
Oh, will they send a truck?

02:05.225 --> 02:06.676
SAM: Hey, Frasier!

02:06.676 --> 02:07.677
The usual?

02:07.677 --> 02:08.678
Oh, not just yet.

02:08.678 --> 02:10.062
I'm meeting a friend for a drink.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.764
Simon Finch-Royce. Mm.

02:11.764 --> 02:15.185
Dr. Simon Finch-Royce, the
n-noted marriage counselor?

02:15.185 --> 02:17.187
No, Dr. Finch-Royce, the circus geek.

02:17.187 --> 02:19.155
Ah.

02:19.155 --> 02:20.523
Yes, of course, the marriage counselor.

02:20.523 --> 02:22.742
We were students together
when I was a Rhodes Scholar.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.577
Wow, you were a Rhodes Scholar?

02:25.578 --> 02:26.496
Tell me this:

02:26.996 --> 02:28.498
how come the stuff they
fill in the potholes with

02:28.998 --> 02:31.000
is darker than the rest of the road?

02:34.838 --> 02:37.123
I don't know, Woody. I missed that day.

02:37.957 --> 02:40.460
And now it's come back to haunt you.

02:41.461 --> 02:42.846
Sam...

02:42.846 --> 02:46.132
Simon Finch-Royce is an
eminent psychotherapist

02:46.132 --> 02:48.384
who specializes in marital relations.

02:48.384 --> 02:49.602
Does "eminent"

02:49.602 --> 02:51.888
by any chance mean "rich and single"?

02:51.888 --> 02:54.858
Anyway, Sam, I think it's safe to say

02:54.858 --> 02:58.111
that he has saved
hundreds, nay, thousands

02:58.111 --> 02:59.445
of troubled marriages.

02:59.445 --> 03:03.316
It's even rumored that he had
a hand in helping Chuck and Di.

03:03.316 --> 03:06.236
Speaking of that, why
don't you upchuck and die?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.410
? Three little maids
from school are we... ?

03:14.410 --> 03:16.913
? Pert as a schoolgirl well may be... ?

03:16.913 --> 03:18.915
? Filled to the brim with girlish glee ?

03:18.915 --> 03:22.919
? Three little maids from school. ?

03:24.921 --> 03:26.806
Sam, you want me to call the police?

03:26.806 --> 03:27.807
FRASIER: Uh, no...

03:27.807 --> 03:29.309
no cause for alarm, Woody.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.811
Simon and I did the spring
musical together at Oxford.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.763
It was The Mikado.

03:33.763 --> 03:35.265
Simon played Pitti-Sing,
and I was Yum-Yum.

03:35.265 --> 03:37.767
And a handsomer
Yum-Yum I've never seen.

03:37.767 --> 03:38.768
It's good to see you, Simon.

03:38.768 --> 03:39.769
Uh, how was your flight? All right?

03:39.769 --> 03:43.273
Oh, relatively crash-free.

03:43.273 --> 03:44.274
Can I buy you a drink?

03:44.274 --> 03:45.275
Yes, a pint of beer,

03:45.275 --> 03:46.776
but none of that
weak-kneed American bile.

03:46.776 --> 03:48.778
Give me, uh, a little
something with hair on it.

03:48.778 --> 03:51.247
Here I am.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.169
So, uh, you married?

03:56.169 --> 03:57.670
Yes, quite happily.

03:57.670 --> 04:00.673
Too bad. Could've been
my first Englishman.

04:00.673 --> 04:03.676
No, no, no, wait, there
was that one other guy,

04:03.676 --> 04:06.846
but he was so white, I kept
losing him in the sheets.

04:10.049 --> 04:10.850
Do we know her?

04:10.850 --> 04:12.352
Yes, that's Carla.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.221
Have her scrubbed and sent to my tent.

04:16.639 --> 04:18.641
Sam, a Guinness for my friend.

04:18.641 --> 04:19.976
Guinness coming right up.

04:19.976 --> 04:22.445
Oh, Simon, by the way:
Sam Malone, Woody Boyd.

04:22.445 --> 04:23.446
Simon Finch-Royce. Hi. Hi.

04:23.446 --> 04:25.698
Howdy. Howdy.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.700
Oh, and, uh, this is Diane Chambers.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.202
Oh, how do you do?

04:29.202 --> 04:31.704
Delighted to make your acquaintance.

04:31.704 --> 04:35.208
You're so much taller than
you looked on your book jacket.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.211
Ah, yes, but you see, the
book's only about that big.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.079
That must be it.

04:40.079 --> 04:41.047
So, what brings you here?

04:41.047 --> 04:43.049
Oh, I'm accepting an honorary degree.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.550
It's nothing much--
just a small college--

04:44.550 --> 04:46.552
but, uh, any excuse
to pop over the pond.

04:46.552 --> 04:47.754
NORM: Doc, uh,

04:47.754 --> 04:48.554
Hi. I'm Norm Peterson.

04:48.554 --> 04:49.555
Oh.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.057
I have to tell you that my wife

04:51.057 --> 04:52.558
is a big fan of yours, sir. Oh.

04:52.558 --> 04:53.559
Yeah, she reads

04:53.559 --> 04:55.061
all those marriage improvement books.

04:55.061 --> 04:55.928
Great. Have they helped?

04:55.928 --> 04:56.846
Well, they've helped me.

04:56.846 --> 04:58.848
It, uh, gives her
something to do in bed.

04:58.848 --> 05:00.850
I have a few questions...
Thank you, Norm.

05:00.850 --> 05:03.736
Shall we just go over here,
where it's a little quieter?

05:03.736 --> 05:05.488
Splendid idea.

05:06.990 --> 05:08.992
Oh, thank you.

05:08.992 --> 05:11.494
Oh, Frasier, please join us.

05:11.494 --> 05:12.862
Oh, Sam, may I have

05:12.862 --> 05:14.247
a seltzer, please?

05:14.247 --> 05:16.115
You know, I had a thought.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.002
Sam and I are about
to be married, and...

05:19.002 --> 05:21.004
dare I ask it, could you be persuaded

05:21.004 --> 05:24.007
to possibly have a
session or two with us?

05:24.007 --> 05:25.008
Oh, Diane...

05:25.008 --> 05:25.958
I think it's a capital idea.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.344
(Diane giggles) Ah, well, then,

05:28.344 --> 05:29.095
let it be my wedding gift to you.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.096
I was considering

05:30.096 --> 05:31.597
the gravy boat, but I think

05:31.597 --> 05:33.966
our relationship
transcends mere crockery.

05:35.768 --> 05:36.769
Are you sure you don't mind?

05:36.769 --> 05:38.771
Oh, not at all. I'm
a terrible workaholic.

05:38.771 --> 05:39.772
And also, it'll be refreshing

05:39.772 --> 05:41.274
to work with a couple

05:41.274 --> 05:42.775
who are not on the brink of disaster.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.777
Thank you, Sam. Will you
excuse us for a minute here?

05:44.777 --> 05:46.279
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

05:46.279 --> 05:48.781
Oh, excuse me.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.782
Why do you want to do this?

05:49.782 --> 05:50.783
We're not in trouble.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.285
We're not even married yet.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.786
Sam, marriage counselors

05:53.786 --> 05:56.289
aren't just for people
who are having troubles.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.292
His expertise will help us lay

05:59.292 --> 06:01.294
a solid foundation for our married life.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.546
(in British accent): Now,
what say we give it a go?

06:03.546 --> 06:04.881
Hey, wh-what's with
this English accent?

06:04.881 --> 06:05.882
Ever since he walked in here,

06:05.882 --> 06:08.384
you-you been talking like the queen

06:08.384 --> 06:10.253
was your Aunt Betty or something.

06:10.253 --> 06:12.922
(with accent): Oh, tosh. What twaddle.

06:12.922 --> 06:14.841
See, th...

06:14.841 --> 06:16.843
Hey, yeah, but, you
know, so, if you Brits

06:16.843 --> 06:18.344
ever find yourself in trouble

06:18.344 --> 06:22.348
against, uh, another major
military power like Argentina,

06:22.348 --> 06:25.318
you know, one thing is, uh,

06:25.318 --> 06:27.320
well, we Yanks'll be
there to bail you out

06:27.320 --> 06:29.689
just like we were during
the last two big ones, huh?

06:29.689 --> 06:31.274
NORM: Cliffie, Cliff!

06:31.274 --> 06:32.692
There's a gentleman over
here that thinks you know

06:32.692 --> 06:35.194
absolutely nothing about photosynthesis.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.696
Oh, yeah, who?

06:36.696 --> 06:40.700
Why... Why, I'll straighten him out.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.584
The first paper that was done...

06:41.584 --> 06:44.504
So, Doctor, when shall we begin?

06:44.504 --> 06:45.421
Why not right now?

06:45.421 --> 06:47.790
Sure. Is-is there anywhere
with a little privacy?

06:47.790 --> 06:49.008
Well, there's Sam's office.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.426
You don't mind, do you, Sam?

06:50.426 --> 06:51.794
Of course you don't. Lovely.

06:51.794 --> 06:55.098
Oh, Simon, Simon, this
is strictly professional.

06:55.098 --> 06:56.099
I want you to bill me for this.

06:56.099 --> 06:57.600
Oh, right.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.102
Yes. And I do want you
to completely disregard

06:59.102 --> 07:00.603
our years and years of friendship

07:00.603 --> 07:01.604
when determining your fee.

07:01.604 --> 07:03.106
Oh, well, whatever you say.

07:03.106 --> 07:03.973
Look, I mean it, now.

07:03.973 --> 07:05.475
I-I'll hear nothing of that 40%

07:05.475 --> 07:06.976
psychiatrist's courtesy discount

07:06.976 --> 07:08.478
that's customary here in the States.

07:08.478 --> 07:09.979
I wouldn't dream of insulting you.

07:10.980 --> 07:14.484
Well, I'm glad we worked that out.

07:14.484 --> 07:17.487
Well, now, uh, where to begin.

07:17.487 --> 07:18.988
Well, usually, at this point,

07:18.988 --> 07:19.956
you would tell me

07:19.956 --> 07:21.958
what a loathsome,
contemptible swine he is,

07:21.958 --> 07:23.326
and, uh, you would describe

07:23.326 --> 07:27.213
in some detail what a wanton,
libidinous trollop she is...

07:28.831 --> 07:29.632
...but as you're only engaged,

07:29.632 --> 07:32.135
we'll just have to look forward to that.

07:34.137 --> 07:37.140
When I was on the staff of
the London Psychiatric Hospital

07:37.140 --> 07:38.474
just after my divorce,
we had a couple that...

07:38.474 --> 07:39.675
Excuse me.

07:39.675 --> 07:40.343
Hmm?

07:40.343 --> 07:41.561
You've been divorced?

07:41.561 --> 07:42.395
Yes, I have.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.764
(chuckling): That's great.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.266
Now, Sam, Sam, I can
say to you with pride,

07:47.266 --> 07:48.267
"Yes, I have been divorced,"

07:48.267 --> 07:51.154
because it is only from our failures

07:51.154 --> 07:52.522
that we gain knowledge.

07:52.522 --> 07:54.023
Consequently, I was able to make

07:54.023 --> 07:56.275
a much better choice of a second wife.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.610
Perhaps my vision

07:57.610 --> 08:01.030
was clearer for the
tears that I had shed.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.285
You are the wisest man I know.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.541
High praise, indeed. Well, now, uh...

08:15.545 --> 08:17.380
...I need to begin to
get to know you two,

08:17.380 --> 08:19.382
so, Diane, why don't,
why don't you start?

08:19.382 --> 08:23.269
Well, they say you don't
have prenatal memories,

08:23.269 --> 08:27.523
but I have a distinct
in-utero recollection

08:27.523 --> 08:31.027
of a Fourth of July
concert my mother attended.

08:31.027 --> 08:33.529
There was at least one Souza march...

08:33.529 --> 08:35.898
And then he proposed
to me in, of all places,

08:35.898 --> 08:38.284
a court of law.

08:38.284 --> 08:43.405
This time I acquiesced and
agreed to become Mrs. Malone...

08:43.405 --> 08:44.957
(snoring quietly)

08:45.741 --> 08:48.127
...which brings us here today.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.914
You know, my wife has a skirt

08:51.914 --> 08:53.716
very similar to the one you're wearing.

08:56.085 --> 08:57.336
(laughs)

08:58.137 --> 09:00.006
Sam...

09:00.006 --> 09:02.008
a little of your history, please.

09:02.008 --> 09:05.511
Oh, right, all right. Okay, uh...

09:05.511 --> 09:09.398
Let's see, uh, it was,
uh, August 5, 1973.

09:09.398 --> 09:11.901
I, uh, got my first major league save.

09:11.901 --> 09:13.853
It was in Baltimore.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.606
Sam, you don't have
to go into all of that.

09:16.606 --> 09:17.406
If you can go back to the womb,

09:17.406 --> 09:19.909
I can go back to the
damn Oriole doubleheader.

09:22.161 --> 09:23.829
Anyway, uh...

09:23.829 --> 09:24.780
sweltering day.

09:24.780 --> 09:26.782
Frank Robinson had been
killing me all season,

09:26.782 --> 09:28.284
but this day, I'm telling you...

09:28.284 --> 09:30.036
...it happened every single time.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.003
Which means that,

09:31.003 --> 09:32.004
no matter what town you were in,

09:32.004 --> 09:35.291
these women would just hang
around outside your locker room,

09:35.291 --> 09:36.792
I mean, complete strangers,

09:36.792 --> 09:38.294
and-and throw themselves at you?

09:38.294 --> 09:39.295
Yeah.

09:39.295 --> 09:41.297
(whispering): It was great.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.301
Well, uh, moving on.

09:45.801 --> 09:47.803
Now, um, what-what are the keys

09:47.803 --> 09:49.805
to a successful marriage?

09:49.805 --> 09:51.307
Well, there are numerous
schools of thought.

09:51.307 --> 09:52.808
Uh, many experts claim

09:53.309 --> 09:57.313
that the most important single
ingredient in a marriage is...

09:57.313 --> 09:58.230
Quickly now.

09:58.230 --> 09:58.981
Love?

09:58.981 --> 09:59.699
Sex.

09:59.699 --> 10:02.451
Honesty...

10:02.451 --> 10:05.454
because from honesty springs...

10:05.454 --> 10:05.955
Fidelity.

10:05.955 --> 10:08.157
Sex.

10:08.157 --> 10:10.910
Yes, trust.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.829
Oh, I was going to say that.

10:13.829 --> 10:16.332
Well, those people are wrong.

10:16.332 --> 10:17.833
Now, during the, uh, course

10:17.833 --> 10:19.335
of my counseling, I have come up

10:19.335 --> 10:20.836
with a number of scenarios,

10:20.836 --> 10:23.839
the responses to which
give very useful pointers

10:23.839 --> 10:25.341
to a couple's compatibility.

10:25.341 --> 10:26.842
So, Sam, we'll start with you.

10:28.728 --> 10:29.645
You're on your honeymoon.

10:29.645 --> 10:31.647
With Diane?

10:31.647 --> 10:32.648
With Diane.

10:32.648 --> 10:34.517
Now, the two of you

10:34.517 --> 10:35.818
are on a tropical beach

10:35.818 --> 10:38.154
wearing nothing but your swimming togs.

10:38.154 --> 10:41.657
Uh, Doctor, I do have
a tendency to freckle.

10:42.525 --> 10:44.527
Diane is wearing a big hat.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.664
Now, Sam, you see a woman walk by.

10:48.664 --> 10:51.167
Her flesh is tawny from the tropic sun.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.536
Her proud yet supple
bosoms heave mightily

10:53.536 --> 10:56.005
against the constraints
of her tiny bikini.

10:56.505 --> 10:58.708
You think she is the most beautiful
creature that you have ever seen.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.010
At this moment, Diane
turns to you and says,

11:01.010 --> 11:02.011
"A penny for your thoughts."

11:02.011 --> 11:03.879
Do you share them with her?

11:03.879 --> 11:07.133
Uh, gee, that's, uh, that's hard to say.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.635
Wh-When you say "bikini",
is it that French cut...?

11:09.635 --> 11:11.020
Sam!

11:11.020 --> 11:13.356
I'm just trying to clarify things here.

11:14.857 --> 11:17.276
All right, all right,
do I tell her? Um...

11:17.276 --> 11:19.228
No, of course not.

11:19.228 --> 11:22.615
You wouldn't trust me to handle that?

11:23.566 --> 11:24.984
Well, yes, of course I would.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.369
Did I say no? I meant yes.

11:26.369 --> 11:27.236
All right.

11:27.236 --> 11:29.538
Diane, it's your wedding night.

11:29.538 --> 11:31.490
You and Sam have just made love,

11:31.490 --> 11:34.877
and Sam has not performed
to your satisfaction.

11:34.877 --> 11:37.380
(laughing)

11:42.301 --> 11:44.303
He asks you how it was.

11:44.303 --> 11:45.805
Do you tell him?

11:47.807 --> 11:49.175
I never have before.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.509
(chuckling): I'm kidding.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.510
I'm kidding.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.262
I tell you I'm kidding.

11:54.563 --> 11:56.065
Of course I wouldn't tell him.

11:56.065 --> 11:56.932
It would hurt his feelings.

11:56.932 --> 11:58.768
Fine. Well, I...

11:58.768 --> 12:00.269
just have to express my appreciation

12:00.269 --> 12:02.104
that you've been so open with me.

12:02.104 --> 12:03.105
I've heard enough.

12:03.105 --> 12:03.989
(happy gasp)

12:03.989 --> 12:04.607
That's it?

12:04.607 --> 12:05.357
Of course, Sam,

12:05.357 --> 12:06.859
that's all he has to hear.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.360
The good doctor is a brilliant man.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.362
I'm sure he has a complete
handle on our relationship.

12:10.362 --> 12:11.864
Yes, I have.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.365
You two should not only not get married,

12:13.365 --> 12:15.251
you should never see each other again.

12:18.921 --> 12:19.922
What?!

12:19.922 --> 12:21.424
Well, I'm sorry to be so blunt,

12:21.424 --> 12:23.926
but sometimes a surgeon
has to cut in order to cure.

12:23.926 --> 12:25.795
Whoa...

12:25.795 --> 12:27.046
what's the problem?

12:27.046 --> 12:29.048
Well, would that there were only one,

12:29.048 --> 12:30.299
but there are so many.

12:30.299 --> 12:32.101
Oh, yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.

12:32.101 --> 12:33.602
SIMON: I mean...

12:33.602 --> 12:35.104
first of all, and most obviously,

12:35.104 --> 12:36.605
you have absolutely nothing in common.

12:36.605 --> 12:37.606
Then, on top of that,

12:37.606 --> 12:39.475
you have an appalling
lack of communication.

12:39.475 --> 12:42.812
What about the idea
that opposites attract?

12:42.812 --> 12:45.314
Ah, the song of the truly desperate.

12:45.314 --> 12:48.317
Well, take it from...

12:48.317 --> 12:49.819
take it from one who has observed

12:49.819 --> 12:51.320
dozens of failed
marriages--

12:51.320 --> 12:53.823
the only thing that
opposites attract is divorce.

12:53.823 --> 12:55.324
Well, don't, wait a minute, don't go.

12:55.324 --> 12:56.325
What shall we do?

12:56.325 --> 12:57.326
Well, think yourselves lucky.

12:57.326 --> 12:59.211
I mean, you found out now.

12:59.211 --> 13:00.663
Saved yourself years, perhaps decades,

13:00.663 --> 13:02.965
of pain and heartache.

13:02.965 --> 13:04.834
Cheerio.

13:12.408 --> 13:13.909
FRASIER: Ah, Simon!

13:13.909 --> 13:16.162
Simon, I've signed a blank check.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.446
Now, remember, no favors.

13:17.446 --> 13:18.948
I want you to fill in your regular fee.

13:18.948 --> 13:19.949
Oh, as you wish. Thanks.

13:19.949 --> 13:21.951
Say, excuse me, I must
dash back to the hotel.

13:21.951 --> 13:22.952
Oh, listen, just for my ledger,

13:22.952 --> 13:24.453
uh, what amount should I fill in?

13:24.453 --> 13:25.337
$1,500.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.256
Fine. $1,500. Done.

13:27.256 --> 13:29.625
Pretentious limey bastard.

13:32.094 --> 13:33.462
Well, what am I saying?

13:33.462 --> 13:35.297
It was your wedding
gift and he is the best.

13:35.297 --> 13:37.132
The man's a quack.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.135
Imagine he had the nerve to say

13:40.135 --> 13:41.887
that Sam and I shouldn't get married.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.557
(in British accent): That we
have absolutely nothing in common.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.858
Excuse me, Diane.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.726
What exactly do you two have in common?

13:50.145 --> 13:51.313
Well, we...

13:52.865 --> 13:53.649
Wait a minute.

13:54.149 --> 13:55.150
Somebody suggesting

13:55.150 --> 13:58.153
Sam and Diane aren't
right for each other.

13:58.153 --> 14:00.072
Now, where have I heard that be...

14:00.072 --> 14:02.074
Of course. My prayers.

14:05.461 --> 14:06.962
What are we gone do?

14:06.962 --> 14:08.964
We're going to get married, of course.

14:08.964 --> 14:13.469
We're not going to listen to
that sack of fish 'n' chips.

14:15.971 --> 14:17.890
Wait a minute.

14:17.890 --> 14:21.894
(laughs)

14:21.894 --> 14:24.396
Why, that wily old bird.

14:24.396 --> 14:25.898
He's brilliant.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.900
Hold it, hold it, hold
it, hold it, hold it.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.402
First, he's brilliant,
then he's a quack,

14:30.402 --> 14:31.403
and now he's brilliant again?!

14:31.403 --> 14:33.105
DIANE: Don't you see?

14:33.105 --> 14:34.490
It was a test.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.492
He was testing our resolve

14:36.492 --> 14:37.993
in the face of his pronouncement.

14:37.993 --> 14:39.995
Come on, let's go to his hotel.

14:39.995 --> 14:41.997
No, I don't want to do that. Come on.

14:41.997 --> 14:45.868
Sam, we have to prove to
him that we are indivisible.

14:45.868 --> 14:47.670
Oh, I can't believe that I almost fell

14:47.670 --> 14:49.171
for the oldest trick in the book.

14:49.171 --> 14:50.673
(Sam groans) Come on.

14:50.673 --> 14:53.542
Why, I thought the oldest
trick in the book was the one

14:53.542 --> 14:56.345
where the guy tells you
you got a spot on your shirt

14:56.345 --> 14:58.347
and then when you
look down, bud-oom--

14:58.347 --> 14:59.598
flicks you in the nose.

14:59.598 --> 15:03.385
Well, uh, Woody, you do have
a spot on your shirt there.

15:03.385 --> 15:05.771
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Clavin.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.273
I'm not falling for that.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.274
I'm much too smart for you.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.642
Wait, no, no, Woody, Woody.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.443
You, you got a spot right there.

15:11.443 --> 15:12.945
Yeah, yeah, right.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.947
You're not gone make
me look like a dope.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.073
No, darling, I've settled
in for the evening.

15:24.073 --> 15:25.874
I'm desperate for a
bit of peace and quiet,

15:25.874 --> 15:28.661
so I'll just have a bite to
eat and a bath and pop into bed.

15:28.661 --> 15:31.797
Oh, that pompous twit
Frasier Crane says hello.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.583
Yes, bad as usual, if not worse.

15:34.583 --> 15:38.387
Still, you may be amused to
know I stuck him for $1,500.

15:38.387 --> 15:39.221
(knocking at door)

15:39.221 --> 15:40.673
Oh, uh, excuse me, darling.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.674
There's someone at the door.

15:41.674 --> 15:42.675
Shall we say...

15:42.675 --> 15:43.676
Yes, all right.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.478
Yes, I love you, too.

15:50.482 --> 15:51.483
Oh!

15:51.483 --> 15:52.484
Hello, Doctor.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.353
Ah, this is a surprise.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.654
Uh, sorry about this.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.156
We didn't catch you on
the hopper, did we? Uh...

15:57.156 --> 16:00.025
No, but thanks for asking.

16:00.025 --> 16:00.909
Come in.

16:00.909 --> 16:04.163
This will only take a moment.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.665
You know, you're a very clever man.

16:06.665 --> 16:09.668
It wasn't until after
you'd left that we realized

16:09.668 --> 16:12.671
you were merely testing our resolve.

16:12.671 --> 16:14.673
So we stand before you now

16:14.673 --> 16:18.677
as proof we are steadfast in
our devotion to one another.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.679
Well, that's very lovely,
but it wasn't a test.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.182
Oh, listen to him, Sam.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.184
It's yet another test.

16:25.184 --> 16:27.686
I'm afraid I haven't made
myself sufficiently clear.

16:27.686 --> 16:28.687
Um...

16:28.687 --> 16:31.607
you two are an accident

16:32.024 --> 16:34.360
waiting to marry.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.365
Well, you couldn't be more wrong.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.367
If you only knew the enormous

16:41.367 --> 16:42.868
obstacles we've overcome,

16:42.868 --> 16:44.370
you would know that we are destined

16:44.370 --> 16:46.372
to die in each other's arms.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.874
Because, although we are
very different people,

16:48.874 --> 16:52.378
our parts mesh together perfectly.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.880
We have achieved symbiosis.

16:55.381 --> 16:58.384
Well, not every time, but it's close.

17:00.636 --> 17:02.671
(speaking quietly)

17:02.671 --> 17:04.173
Sorry about this.

17:04.173 --> 17:05.057
Aren't we all?

17:10.813 --> 17:12.815
All I'm saying is maybe he's right.

17:12.815 --> 17:14.316
Maybe we should give it some thought.

17:14.316 --> 17:15.317
Maybe we should wait.

17:15.818 --> 17:16.819
Maybe I'm a confirmed bachelor.

17:16.819 --> 17:20.071
Maybe you'll do me the honor
of sticking a sock in it.

17:20.071 --> 17:21.906
I take it it didn't go so well.

17:21.906 --> 17:23.909
He claims it wasn't a test.

17:23.909 --> 17:27.913
If you ask me, his
methods are highly suspect.

17:27.913 --> 17:30.916
How can he say that we are mismatched

17:30.916 --> 17:32.918
on the basis of two silly questions.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.921
I didn't even answer mine accurately.

17:35.921 --> 17:37.923
I said what I thought he wanted to hear.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.426
Sam, did you answer the
way you wanted to answer

17:40.426 --> 17:42.795
or the way you thought
he wanted you to answer?

17:42.795 --> 17:45.013
Or the way you thought
I wanted you to answer?

17:45.013 --> 17:46.298
I don't know, I got confused

17:46.298 --> 17:48.183
after the babe in the bikini walked by.

17:51.103 --> 17:52.604
Well, Diane,

17:52.604 --> 17:54.556
did you tell Simon all this?

17:57.059 --> 17:59.061
No, I didn't.

17:59.061 --> 18:01.563
But I'm going to now.

18:01.563 --> 18:02.564
Come on, Sam.

18:02.564 --> 18:04.066
We just came back from that hotel.

18:04.066 --> 18:05.567
I'm not going back there again.

18:05.567 --> 18:08.320
Sam, this is a crucial
point in our relationship.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.121
Oh, I am starved.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.622
I haven't eaten all day. Come on.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.624
Uh, both of you, go to Finch-Royce.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.625
Tell him the truth.

18:13.625 --> 18:14.993
Let him make an accurate

18:14.993 --> 18:15.794
assessment of your relationship.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.162
You owe it to me.

18:17.162 --> 18:18.464
You owe it to him.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.215
And most of all, you
owe it to yourselves.

18:20.215 --> 18:22.050
Now don't come back until
you're fully satisfied.

18:22.050 --> 18:22.801
I don't care

18:22.801 --> 18:23.635
how long it takes.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.637
All right, all right. Right. Thank you.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.639
1,500 bucks, my butt.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.641
Frasier Crane can play hardball, too.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.649
If you need anything
else, just let me know.

18:37.649 --> 18:38.650
Oh, thank you.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.153
Now, are you sure the soup
is piping hot this time?

18:41.153 --> 18:42.154
Oh, yes, sir.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.155
I burned myself on the bowl.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.156
Excellent.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.947
(knocking at door)

18:51.947 --> 18:53.332
(sighs)

18:58.670 --> 19:01.039
Ah, how lovely to see you again.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.875
What's it been, 30 minutes?

19:02.875 --> 19:05.677
I'm sorry to barge in.

19:05.677 --> 19:06.678
I hope we're not disturbing you.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.181
Well, actually, I was just
about to have my dinner.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.549
Dinner?

19:10.549 --> 19:12.801
Yes, I mean, uh, I
don't want to sound rude,

19:12.801 --> 19:15.304
but I actually would like
to eat it while it's hot.

19:15.304 --> 19:16.805
I'm sorry, but this is simply

19:16.805 --> 19:18.307
too important to put it off.

19:18.307 --> 19:19.808
It's been preying on our minds.

19:19.808 --> 19:21.810
We really can't think of anything else.

19:21.810 --> 19:22.811
Isn't that right, Sam? Yeah, right.

19:23.312 --> 19:24.313
Are you gone eat those crackers?

19:24.313 --> 19:26.315
Yes, I am. Now, could
you please just say

19:26.315 --> 19:27.316
whatever it is you've come to say?

19:27.316 --> 19:28.817
Very well.

19:28.817 --> 19:30.319
From the moment of your pronouncement,

19:30.319 --> 19:32.321
we felt that you were wrong,

19:32.321 --> 19:34.823
and now we realize why.

19:34.823 --> 19:36.825
We gave you the wrong answers

19:36.825 --> 19:38.827
to your questions about the honeymoon.

19:38.827 --> 19:40.329
We've thought it over

19:40.329 --> 19:42.831
and now we want to give
you our real answers.

19:42.831 --> 19:44.833
Yes, well, it doesn't
matter what you say now.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.335
You see, I mean, what matters

19:46.335 --> 19:48.337
is your first response,
your gut reaction.

19:48.337 --> 19:50.839
I mean, you've had two
hours to think about it now.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.342
Yes, well, sometimes,
it takes Sam two hours

19:53.342 --> 19:56.345
to come up with his first thought.

19:57.846 --> 20:00.349
I don't, I don't appreciate that.

20:00.349 --> 20:01.850
You know, it was your stupid idea

20:01.850 --> 20:02.851
to come here in the first place.

20:02.851 --> 20:04.853
All of a sudden, he says
something you don't like

20:04.853 --> 20:06.355
and now you, you don't
believe him anymore?

20:06.855 --> 20:07.856
DIANE: Well, he's wrong.

20:07.856 --> 20:09.358
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

20:09.358 --> 20:10.859
Don't you think he's
capable of making a mistake?

20:10.859 --> 20:11.860
That's highly
unlikely--

20:11.860 --> 20:14.363
although I did let the two of you in.

20:14.363 --> 20:15.864
Excuse me, um...

20:15.864 --> 20:17.866
Come on, let's get
out of here, will you?

20:17.866 --> 20:19.868
I'm starved, I'm gone
go have some dinner.

20:19.868 --> 20:20.869
You want to join me?

20:20.869 --> 20:22.254
Please say yes.

20:28.927 --> 20:31.713
(knocking)

20:38.720 --> 20:40.222
Oh, I wondered what was keeping you.

20:40.222 --> 20:43.108
I was beginning to get worried.

20:43.108 --> 20:44.776
Did we get you out of the shower?

20:44.776 --> 20:47.562
No, no, no, no, the,
uh, the soup was so hot

20:47.562 --> 20:48.814
it set off the sprinkler system.

20:50.115 --> 20:52.618
Sam and I have been to the library

20:52.618 --> 20:54.620
and we've done extensive research.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.989
We're here to tell you that
you are full of rubbish.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.457
How thoughtful.

20:58.457 --> 21:02.461
Most people would only have phoned.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.463
Now, if you'll just examine
the parts that I have marked...

21:04.463 --> 21:06.465
I think I've shown
remarkable restraint so far,

21:06.465 --> 21:08.467
but I have had just
about enough of this.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.468
Now, I've said

21:09.885 --> 21:10.919
that you're not compatible

21:10.919 --> 21:13.922
and you have done nothing
to show me otherwise.

21:13.922 --> 21:15.924
Look, I don't know what
we're supposed to do

21:15.924 --> 21:18.427
or what we're supposed
to say, but we're here,

21:18.427 --> 21:19.928
fighting for our lives together.

21:19.928 --> 21:21.430
Now doesn't that count for something?

21:21.430 --> 21:23.765
No.

21:27.402 --> 21:28.320
Why not?

21:28.320 --> 21:30.322
Well, let me answer you this way: Sam,

21:30.322 --> 21:31.323
do you really want to be here?

21:31.323 --> 21:32.824
No.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.326
Oh, what do you mean "no"?

21:34.326 --> 21:36.194
I mean no. I don't want to be here.

21:36.194 --> 21:38.196
I mean, this whole thing
was your stupid idea.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.198
What do we care if this guy

21:40.198 --> 21:41.199
doesn't think we should get married?

21:41.199 --> 21:43.201
Nobody we know thinks
we should get married.

21:43.201 --> 21:47.205
We don't go bugging them in
the middle of the night, do we?

21:47.205 --> 21:48.707
All right,

21:48.707 --> 21:50.709
what do you suggest we do?

21:50.709 --> 21:52.210
Nothing.

21:52.210 --> 21:53.211
Oh!

21:53.211 --> 21:55.213
That's your solution
to everything: nothing!

21:55.213 --> 21:57.215
Is that what you're going to do

21:57.215 --> 21:58.717
for the rest of your life: nothing?

21:58.717 --> 22:00.218
I haven't decided yet.

22:04.272 --> 22:06.775
I've grown to hate them.

22:11.113 --> 22:14.900
(knocking at door)

22:25.077 --> 22:27.746
That's it. I've died and gone to hell.

22:27.746 --> 22:32.584
Doctor, there's one thing
you haven't considered.

22:32.584 --> 22:36.088
Right. Fine. All right. Okay.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.090
Um, Sam, Diane,

22:38.090 --> 22:42.094
you two are perfect together.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.096
I'm sorry I made a mistake,

22:44.096 --> 22:45.597
but I now see that you are

22:45.597 --> 22:48.984
the most perfectly matched
couple on the face of the earth.

22:48.984 --> 22:50.902
But, why, why am I telling you this?

22:50.902 --> 22:53.905
Let's, let's share it with the
rest of the world, shall we?

22:53.905 --> 22:55.273
Hear this, world,

22:55.273 --> 22:58.076
the rest of you can
stop getting married now!

22:58.076 --> 22:59.945
It's been done to perfection!

22:59.945 --> 23:01.913
Envy them, sofa. Envy them, chair.

23:01.913 --> 23:04.416
For you shall never be as cozy as they.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.918
For I guarantee that their marriage

23:06.918 --> 23:09.921
will be a total
epoch-shattering success.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.924
And I stake my life on it!

23:12.924 --> 23:15.927
Wait, let, let me put that on record.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.432
I, Dr. Simon Finch-Royce,

23:20.432 --> 23:22.300
being of sound mind,

23:22.300 --> 23:24.269
declare that Sam and Diane

23:24.269 --> 23:26.772
shall be together
throughout all eternity,

23:26.772 --> 23:27.773
and if I am wrong,

23:27.773 --> 23:30.275
I hereby promise that
I will take my own life

23:30.275 --> 23:33.278
in the most disgusting manner possible!

23:35.230 --> 23:36.231
Here, take the tape.

23:36.231 --> 23:37.232
No, no, no, no, no!

23:37.232 --> 23:38.700
Take the whole machine.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.702
It's my wedding
gift to you--

23:40.702 --> 23:42.070
to you, the most perfect couple

23:42.070 --> 23:44.956
since the dawn of time!

23:51.463 --> 23:53.465
See?
