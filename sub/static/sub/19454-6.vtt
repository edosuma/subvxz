<i>Drag Race...</i>

00:04.405 --> 00:05.070
<i> Bitch.</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:06.372
<i>Laganja and I are the best</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:07.740
<i>of friends, but when we do</i>

00:07.742 --> 00:10.109
<i>compete, that can get ugly.</i>

00:10.111 --> 00:11.910
<i> It's time to play</i>

00:11.912 --> 00:13.078
<i>Snatch Game!</i>

00:13.080 --> 00:14.747
<i>[All cheering]</i>

00:14.749 --> 00:16.615
<i> I don't do impersonations.</i>

00:16.617 --> 00:17.649
<i> Kimmy.</i>

00:17.651 --> 00:18.317
<i> [Laughs]</i>

00:18.319 --> 00:20.152
<i> We originated the language.</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:20.853
<i> Baloney!</i>

00:20.855 --> 00:22.554
<i> How's the baby?</i>

00:22.556 --> 00:27.226
<i> Oh, you know, I'm still,</i>
<i>like, having some morning at--</i>
<i>is that--yes, you know,</i>

00:27.228 --> 00:31.563
<i>like throwing up and</i>
<i>stuff after.</i>
<i>Um, the pregnancy--</i>

00:31.565 --> 00:35.868
<i> Ben de LA creme,</i>
<i>you're the winner of</i>
<i>this challenge.</i>

00:35.870 --> 00:44.376
<i>Laganja Estranja.</i>
<i>Shante, you stay.</i>
<i>G-g-g-Gia, sashay away.</i>

00:44.378 --> 00:51.617
<i> Whoo.</i>

00:51.619 --> 00:53.052
<i> Congratulations, Laganja.</i>

00:53.054 --> 00:54.219
<i> Laganja.</i>

00:54.221 --> 00:56.155
<i> I am so grateful that I'm</i>

00:56.157 --> 00:57.556
<i>still in this competition.</i>

00:57.558 --> 01:01.927
<i> Yes, girl, you made it.</i>
<i> You live another day.</i>
<i> But in the outside world,</i>

01:01.929 --> 01:05.597
<i>I'm used to winning,</i>
<i>so in this competition,</i>
<i>it's really hard to see</i>

01:05.599 --> 01:09.968
<i>all my friends get a lot</i>
<i>of praise, especially Adore,</i>
<i>because I don't think her</i>

01:09.970 --> 01:16.708
<i>look is as strong as mine,</i>
<i>and it's really starting</i>
<i>to get to me.</i>

01:16.710 --> 01:18.010
<i> Laganja is an extremely</i>

01:18.012 --> 01:19.611
<i>emotional person,</i>

01:19.613 --> 01:20.712
<i>and that's going to play a toll</i>

01:20.714 --> 01:22.181
<i>on her in the competition.</i>

01:22.183 --> 01:28.287
<i>I think she's just going to</i>
<i>have to get out of her feelings,</i>
<i>just as much as I do too.</i>

01:28.289 --> 01:32.858
<i>Um, well, most of</i>
<i>the girls, I had already</i>
<i>shared this in</i> <i>untucked,</i>

01:32.860 --> 01:38.363
<i>but I want to take the time</i>
<i>out to tell everybody.</i>
<i>August of 2012,</i>

01:38.365 --> 01:44.269
<i>i was diagnosed with HIV.</i>
<i>I wanted to share that</i>
<i>with everybody in here</i>

01:44.271 --> 01:49.007
<i>because I wanted to be</i>
<i>an advocate for people in</i>
<i>this particular community</i>

01:49.009 --> 01:53.278
<i>who are suffering with this,</i>
<i>and they're scared to say</i>
<i>something, and I need people</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:56.348
<i>to know that it's okay.</i>

01:56.350 --> 02:02.154
<i> I think all of us think</i>
<i>that is so noble and courageous.</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

02:02.156 --> 02:04.189
<i> I think it's a huge step</i>

02:04.191 --> 02:05.157
<i>in the right direction for</i>

02:05.159 --> 02:06.358
<i>Trinity to speak her mind.</i>

02:06.360 --> 02:07.292
<i>I was really, really impressed</i>

02:07.294 --> 02:08.060
<i>with that.</i>

02:08.062 --> 02:10.395
<i>I think that's really</i>
<i>commendable.</i>
<i>I think it's amazing.</i>

02:10.397 --> 02:15.767
<i>Good job, girl.</i>
<i>On a lighter note,</i>
<i>congratulations, miss de LA!</i>

02:15.769 --> 02:20.439
<i> Well, thank you.</i>
<i>Did any of the original</i>
<i>six win two challenges?</i>

02:20.441 --> 02:24.843
<i> I won a challenge.</i>
<i>You won a challenge.</i>
<i> I won the first</i>

02:24.845 --> 02:27.079
<i>challenge too.</i>
<i> Oh, you did?</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

02:27.081 --> 02:31.984
<i> I did.</i>
<i> I wasn't there.</i>
<i>Yeah, it doesn't count.</i>

02:31.986 --> 02:33.552
<i>I think it's better not to</i>

02:33.554 --> 02:34.453
<i>strut around and be like a</i>

02:34.455 --> 02:36.088
<i>peacock when you win.</i>

02:36.090 --> 02:39.091
<i>You got to make sure that</i>
<i>you're not too in love</i>
<i>with yourself.</i>

02:39.093 --> 02:41.660
<i>Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i>[Coughs]</i>
<i> I don't know what</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:46.698
<i>that's about.</i>
<i> I got to send her home.</i>

02:46.700 --> 02:53.071
<i> </i> <i>RuPaul Drag Race</i>
the winner of <i>RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i> receives

02:53.073 --> 02:59.678
a sickening supply of
colorevolution cosmetics
and a cash prize of $100,000.

02:59.680 --> 03:06.752
With extra special guest judges
the diamond princess, trina,
and the e.V.E., Eve!

03:06.754 --> 03:09.488

03:12.193 --> 03:17.763
good morn-ting, darling.
Morning.
It's a new day, and we

03:17.765 --> 03:21.400
have no idea what's to come.
I'm feeling great in the
competition so far,

03:21.402 --> 03:25.137
so I know something around
the corner is gonna fuck
me up.

03:25.139 --> 03:28.607
So what are people thinking?
Maybe it'll be an
individual challenge.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.976
Well, I think we're all cool
with individual challenge,
right?

03:30.978 --> 03:35.414
I completely am.
I'm not a group person.
I'm more of a Beyonce myself.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.283
At least Beyonce's
dresses hit the floor.
[Laughs]

03:38.285 --> 03:41.853
Ooh!
So do your tits.
[Siren wails]

03:41.855 --> 03:47.926
All: Oh!
Girl, you got shemail.
Yo, fly girls,

03:47.928 --> 03:54.032
America's next drag superstar
needs to get her freak on, shake
what her mama gave her, and then

03:54.034 --> 03:59.238
drop it like it's hot.
You down with o.P.P.?
All: You know me!

03:59.240 --> 04:02.574
[Laughter]
Hey, latifah.
Page me, girl.

04:02.576 --> 04:08.714
[Applause]
All right.
Hello, hello, hello.

04:08.716 --> 04:17.256
[Applause]
Ladies, today's mini challenge
is sponsored by the letter "t,"

04:17.258 --> 04:21.727
as in all "t," all shade,
hunties.
All: Ooh.

04:21.729 --> 04:28.400
In the great tradition
of <i>Paris is burning,</i>
<i>the library is open!</i>

04:28.402 --> 04:34.006
<i>[Cheers and applause]</i>
<i> Because reading is what?</i>
<i> All: Fundamental!</i>

04:34.008 --> 04:41.680
<i> There you have it, darling.</i>
<i>First up, Bianca Del Rio.</i>
<i>The library is now open.</i>

04:41.682 --> 04:45.951
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Miss Ben de LA creme,</i>
<i>after seeing you in drag,</i>

04:45.953 --> 04:50.856
<i>i realize now why Seattle</i>
<i>has a high suicide rate.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

04:50.858 --> 04:56.395
<i>Joslyn Fox, she's so gay even</i>
<i>her asshole has a lisp.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

04:56.397 --> 05:00.999
<i>Then we have Adore.</i>
<i>I know what you got on</i>
<i>your s.A.T.S.</i>

05:01.001 --> 05:05.637
<i>Ketchup.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Trinity, I believe your smile</i>

05:05.639 --> 05:08.674
<i>belongs on season four.</i>
<i> All: Oh.</i>
<i> 'Cause every day is shark</i>

05:08.676 --> 05:12.477
<i>week with your grill.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>miss Laganja Estranja,</i>

05:12.479 --> 05:18.250
<i>next time you death-drop,</i>
<i>reverse that and drop dead.</i>
<i>[Laughter and applause]</i>

05:18.252 --> 05:21.687
<i> Darienne Lake, I weigh,</i>
<i>like, 110, and I'm really</i>
<i>scared of you, so I'm just</i>

05:21.689 --> 05:25.223
<i>gonna keep it at that.</i>
<i> You better.</i>
<i> And I'm sure you all</i>

05:25.225 --> 05:29.594
<i>will remind me that my</i>
<i>hair is so fried and damaged</i>
<i>that I'm forced to wear</i>

05:29.596 --> 05:32.831
<i>this clip-on pony tail.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>if you can't read yourself,</i>

05:32.833 --> 05:35.200
<i>how the hell can you read</i>
<i>somebody else?</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

05:35.202 --> 05:40.739
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i> Joslyn Fox, you may not be</i>
<i>all that smart, and you may not</i>

05:40.741 --> 05:44.843
<i>be all that pretty--</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> I guess that's it.</i>

05:44.845 --> 05:48.780
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>Miss Darienne Lake,</i>
<i>you should be arrested for</i>

05:48.782 --> 05:52.617
<i>animal cruelty.</i>
<i>The way you abuse those kitten</i>
<i>heels on the runway</i>

05:52.619 --> 05:58.256
<i>is absolutely criminal.</i>
<i> Ben de LA creme,</i>
<i>the cream always rises to</i>

05:58.258 --> 06:03.095
<i>the top, but then again,</i>
<i>so does the scum.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

06:03.097 --> 06:06.898
<i>Miss Joslyn Fox, when we need</i>
<i>a low-rent version of Courtney</i>
<i>act, we'll let you know.</i>

06:06.900 --> 06:11.136
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Adore, you know you're from</i>
<i>the west coast because it's</i>

06:11.138 --> 06:15.073
<i>a three-hour delay before</i>
<i>you finally get a joke.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

06:15.075 --> 06:18.777
<i>Darienne Lake, this is the girl</i>
<i>who probably sits reverse</i>
<i>cowgirl on the toilet just</i>

06:18.779 --> 06:23.048
<i>so she has a flat surface</i>
<i>to eat off of.</i>
<i>[Hooting and laughter]</i>

06:23.050 --> 06:26.852
<i> Joslyn, you have some really</i>
<i>comforting, old-fashioned</i>
<i>qualities, like how you paint in</i>

06:26.854 --> 06:31.089
<i>sepia tones and your voice</i>
<i>sounds like a dial-up modem.</i>
<i>[Dial-up modem tone]</i>

06:31.091 --> 06:34.292
<i> [Snorts]</i>
<i> Miss Darienne Lake.</i>
<i>You have a lot of jokes,</i>

06:34.294 --> 06:37.629
<i>but to me, they're more</i>
<i>like u.F.O.S.</i>
<i>I mean, they are way out there,</i>

06:37.631 --> 06:43.034
<i>and I've never seen one land.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> a-bore de-lame-o.</i>

06:43.036 --> 06:47.706
<i>Is that a hog on your body,</i>
<i>or are you excited to see me?</i>
<i>[Light laughter]</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:53.178
<i>Bianca del taco trio,</i>
<i>your style is as old and</i>
<i>bitter as you.</i>

06:53.180 --> 07:00.218
<i>You've even got the crypt</i>
<i>keeper crying "boo-hoo-hoo."</i>
<i> Thank you, Dr. Seuss.</i>

07:00.220 --> 07:06.158
<i> Milk, your beauty and fashion</i>
<i>is listed right on the side</i>
<i>of your carton, under "missing."</i>

07:06.160 --> 07:14.032
<i>[Laughter and applause]</i>
<i>Ben de le creme, you remind me</i>
<i>of a Russian doll--</i>

07:14.034 --> 07:19.504
<i>full of yourself.</i>
<i>[Laughter and applause]</i>

07:19.506 --> 07:30.715
<i>A-dore de-lano.</i>
<i>I'm going to say this very</i>
<i>slowly so you can</i>

07:30.717 --> 07:39.991
<i>understand.</i>
<i>You're dumb.</i>
<i>[Boisterous laughter]</i>

07:39.993 --> 07:46.932
<i> All right, the library</i>
<i>is really closed, officially.</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

07:46.934 --> 07:49.000
<i> The winner is...</i>

07:49.002 --> 07:57.042
<i>Darienne Lake.</i>
<i>[Cheers and applause]</i>
<i>you shady bitch.</i>

07:57.044 --> 08:02.047
<i>Okay, ladies.</i>
<i>It's time to prove you're</i>
<i>some hardcore o.G.S.</i>

08:02.049 --> 08:08.353
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>
<i>Original glamazons.</i>
<i>For this week's main challenge,</i>

08:08.355 --> 08:15.627
<i>you're gonna face off in a</i>
<i>'90s-style rap battle royale.</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

08:15.629 --> 08:18.330
<i>Y'all need to write and</i>
<i>perform your own rap to</i>

08:18.332 --> 08:21.700
<i>a track produced by dj shyboy</i>

08:21.702 --> 08:24.603
<i>called</i> <i>oh, no, she better don't.</i>

08:24.605 --> 08:25.971
<i>[Laughter]</i>

08:25.973 --> 08:31.076
<i> Darienne Lake.</i>
<i>Since you won the mini</i>
<i>challenge, you choose the four</i>

08:31.078 --> 08:39.451
<i>mc queens you want on your crew.</i>
<i> Laganja Estranja.</i>
<i>Who's got a fast mouth?</i>

08:39.453 --> 08:44.222
<i>Bianca Del Rio.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>and, I mean, I would be stupid</i>

08:44.224 --> 08:51.062
<i>not to pick two of my idols,</i>
<i>Adore Delano and Courtney Act.</i>

08:51.064 --> 08:51.763
<i> I can't believe that</i>

08:51.765 --> 08:53.632
<i>Darienne isn't choosing me.</i>

08:53.634 --> 08:57.936
<i>It's a little bit of a slap in</i>
<i>the face to not be chosen with</i>
<i>the rest of those girls.</i>

08:57.938 --> 09:04.776
<i> And that means the other</i>
<i>crew is Milk, Ben da LA creme,</i>
<i>Joslyn Fox, and Trinity k.</i>

09:04.778 --> 09:10.382
<i>Bonet.</i>
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines,</i>
<i>and don't get caught sleeping</i>

09:10.384 --> 09:13.652
<i>on your charisma,</i>
<i>uniqueness, nerve,</i>
<i>and talent.</i>

09:13.654 --> 09:18.456
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>
<i> Left, right, boom,</i>
<i>boom, boom, boom,</i>

09:18.458 --> 09:21.259
<i>boom-boom.</i>
<i>This is the challenge that</i>
<i>I've been waiting for.</i>

09:21.261 --> 09:23.929
<i>And then we do this to</i>
<i>switch lines.</i>
<i>Boom, boom.</i>

09:23.931 --> 09:28.400
<i>I love to rap, and I'm a</i>
<i>professional choreographer.</i>
<i> oh, no, she better don't </i>

09:28.402 --> 09:31.570
<i>left, right.</i>
<i> oh, no, she better don't </i>

09:31.572 --> 09:32.837
<i> why are we all doing</i>

09:32.839 --> 09:33.705
<i>this shit?</i>

09:33.707 --> 09:34.606
<i>I don't know what the fuck</i>

09:34.608 --> 09:35.540
<i>that means.</i>

09:35.542 --> 09:40.011
<i>'90s rap is really about</i>
<i>the feel.</i>
<i>"Yeah, motherfucker, yeah."</i>

09:40.013 --> 09:43.515
<i>It's very that.</i>
<i>It's not like "hmm, hmm, uh,</i>
<i>fuck, hmm."</i>

09:43.517 --> 09:48.987
<i>  Oh, no, she better don't </i>
<i> I hate this.</i>
<i>I don't really want to</i>

09:48.989 --> 09:52.324
<i>look like nsync, bitch.</i>
<i>I want to look like salt-n-pepa.</i>

09:52.326 --> 09:54.826
<i> Coming up...</i>

09:54.828 --> 09:55.493
<i> So, Darienne,</i>

09:55.495 --> 09:56.528
<i>why didn't you choose me?</i>

09:56.530 --> 09:59.197
<i> All: Ooh!</i>

09:59.199 --> 10:00.031
<i> I'm a white lady from</i>

10:00.033 --> 10:01.600
<i>the suburbs, so when it</i>

10:01.602 --> 10:03.301
<i>comes to street cred--</i>

10:03.303 --> 10:04.636
<i> big girl walkin' down </i>

10:04.638 --> 10:05.670
<i> this dirty street </i>

<i> walkin' down there </i>

10:06.873 --> 10:08.373
<i> all these dirty feet </i>

10:08.375 --> 10:09.107
<i>jeez--</i>

10:09.109 --> 10:11.176
<i>fuck.</i>

10:11.178 --> 10:13.511
<i> Okay.</i>

10:13.513 --> 10:15.580
<i> [Laughs]</i>

10:15.582 --> 10:20.185
<i> [Laughing]</i>

10:20.187 --> 10:23.355
<i> All:  oh, no </i>
<i> she better don't </i>
<i> oh, no </i>

10:23.357 --> 10:26.524
<i> our main challenge is a</i>

10:26.526 --> 10:29.160
<i>rap battle, like we're fly girls</i>

10:29.162 --> 10:30.061
<i>in the '90s.</i>

10:30.063 --> 10:34.466
<i>We've got to come up with</i>
<i>costuming, lyrics,</i>
<i>and choreograph a whole</i>

10:34.468 --> 10:37.669
<i>hip-hop dance.</i>
<i> Let's just see where</i>
<i>we're all at, and then</i>

10:37.671 --> 10:40.205
<i>we can see where we need</i>
<i>to go from that.</i>
<i> Do you want to start?</i>

10:40.207 --> 10:42.207
<i>  Just take-- </i>
<i>ah.</i>
<i> just take a second </i>

10:42.209 --> 10:46.511
<i> let me show you how I flow </i>
<i> rhinestones and big hair </i>
<i> gowns to the floor </i>

10:46.513 --> 10:52.450
<i> I do think that this is</i>
<i>a prime opportunity for you to</i>
<i>practice your enunciation.</i>

10:52.452 --> 10:53.118
<i> Fuck that.</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:54.019
<i>You don't tell me about</i>

10:54.021 --> 10:54.919
<i>enunciating.</i>

10:54.921 --> 10:56.688
<i>You un-enunciate.</i>

10:56.690 --> 10:57.689
<i>Shit.</i>

10:57.691 --> 10:58.790
<i>This is how I talk.</i>

10:58.792 --> 11:01.526
<i> Just really make sure</i>
<i>you, like, really, like,</i>
<i>wrap your mouth around all</i>

11:01.528 --> 11:05.163
<i>those vowels and all the</i>
<i>consonants individually.</i>
<i> This is rap.</i>

11:05.165 --> 11:09.567
<i>You ain't 'posed to use no</i>
<i>syllables, no vowels.</i>
<i>It's just all street slang.</i>

<i>guys to be on my team,</i>
<i>'cause you're rap people.</i>

11:41.034 --> 11:42.300
<i> Just because Darienne</i>

<i>You don't want to look so</i>

12:03.023 --> 12:05.490

<i>Thank you, mama Ru.</i>

13:02.482 --> 13:10.522
<i> So, Darienne, how did</i>
<i>you choose your group?</i>
<i> How did I choose my group?</i>

13:10.524 --> 13:13.825
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> That sounded really shady.</i>
<i> Right?</i>

13:13.827 --> 13:16.861
<i> What was it, Darienne?</i>
<i>Why don't you enlighten</i>
<i>this bitch?</i>

13:16.863 --> 13:19.063
<i> Well, I really was--</i>
<i>i mean--</i>
<i> no, you weren't.</i>

13:19.065 --> 13:21.232
<i>I caught it.</i>
<i> All right, I'll be direct</i>

13:21.234 --> 13:23.301
<i>Darienne, why didn't you</i>
<i>choose me?</i>
<i> And I'll be completely</i>

13:23.303 --> 13:25.503

<i>I don't have time to deal</i>

13:29.709 --> 13:35.146

<i>When I think '90s rap girl,</i>
<i>my first thought isn't to</i>

13:35.148 --> 13:38.783

<i> I was not actually</i>
<i>trying to be shady,</i>

13:38.785 --> 13:41.820

<i>maybe, 'cause my feelings</i>
<i>were hurt.</i>

That could fuck

16:52.779 --> 16:54.612
up our whole team.

16:54.614 --> 16:59.250
She's overthinking, and she--
she's thinking about
a sandwich.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.552
It's time for the Ru-tang

17:01.554 --> 17:03.588

It's time for the Ru-tang

Okay, Milk.

What are you saying at
that part?

18:25.905 --> 18:29.841
Yeah.
"If you're looking for
a dude or you're in the

18:29.843 --> 18:39.650
preggers mood."
Okay.
Let's do your wide shot.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.320
I don't care if this is

18:42.322 --> 18:43.521
'90s hip-hop.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.490
It's probably not, but I am

18:45.492 --> 18:48.192
just gettin' down and dirty.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.895
I just hope that Eve

18:50.897 --> 18:52.463
and trina are laughing

18:52.465 --> 18:54.332
with her and not at her.

18:54.334 --> 18:58.035
Okay, cut.
Cut.
We got it.

18:58.037 --> 19:02.540
We got enough.
We gonna move on now.
Mc t.K.B.

19:02.542 --> 19:06.043
Now, if I fuck up,
it's 'cause this is not my--
you know, my forte.

19:06.045 --> 19:10.281
Okay, now, I may get my intro
wrong the first time.
Let me listen.

19:10.283 --> 19:14.852
A disclaimer, girl?
[Groans]
Just give it to us.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.321
Okay.
Roll track.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.091

19:20.093 --> 19:22.793
ack.
Uh-oh.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.396
just take a second to see
how this goes
rhinestones

19:25.398 --> 19:30.801
nice gowns in it
the floor
mm-hmm.

19:30.803 --> 19:36.240
Rhinestones, rice gowns
into the floor
fuck.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.642
I cannot fuck this up,

19:37.644 --> 19:40.411
but I'm fucking it up, so...

19:40.413 --> 19:42.813
Take a breath.
Think about it.
Exhale.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.116
Yeah.
Okay.
check it

19:45.118 --> 19:48.019
let's take
go ahead.

19:48.021 --> 19:54.192
I just think Trinity
needs to just be a lot
more confident.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.128
[Sighs]
Are you kidding me?
She kind of psyched herself

19:57.130 --> 20:01.232
out before she started.
It's okay.
It's all good.

20:01.234 --> 20:06.137
I'm feeling for Trinity,
because she really wants
to do really well, but...

20:06.139 --> 20:11.209
Just take a second to see
how this goes
I honestly had no idea

20:11.211 --> 20:15.046
what she was talking about.
Fuck.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.616
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

20:18.618 --> 20:19.450
yeah, yeah!

20:19.452 --> 20:20.885
What's up?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.720
Hey!

20:22.722 --> 20:27.158
Come on, lady rappers.
Today's runway look is
crazy, sexy, cool.

20:27.160 --> 20:32.496
Let's do this, mamas.
When all else fails,
you just have to keep it foxy.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.532
Wah-wah.

20:34.534 --> 20:39.070
What's up, Milk?
You're gonna give us glamour?
Um, glamour.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.540
Yeah.
Spook-house glamour or
real glamour?

20:42.542 --> 20:45.876
Um...
"Um" is not an answer, sir!
[Laughter]

20:45.878 --> 20:49.213
[High-pitched] I think Milk

20:49.215 --> 20:51.249
could pull it off...

20:51.251 --> 20:52.216
But as you can tell by

20:52.218 --> 20:53.084
the way my voice is going

20:53.086 --> 20:55.586
really high, I could be lying.

20:55.588 --> 21:00.358
How you feeling,
miss Trinity?
I'm great.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.895
How you feel?
You know that I don't
get very serious or very

21:04.897 --> 21:09.267
nice about many things.
I just wanted to say to
you that I'm very proud of

21:09.269 --> 21:13.638
you for putting your story
out there.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.739
As soon as Trinity

21:14.741 --> 21:15.806
discussed her status,

21:15.808 --> 21:17.008
it all made sense to me as

21:17.010 --> 21:18.175
to why she was being such

21:18.177 --> 21:20.144
an introvert and anti-social,

21:20.146 --> 21:20.945
because I had been through

21:20.947 --> 21:22.713
it with someone else before.

21:22.715 --> 21:26.083
I had a friend of mine.
For a while, when I moved to
New York, I didn't get to speak

21:26.085 --> 21:29.053
to him.
Didn't hear from him, and I
had no idea what really

21:29.055 --> 21:36.127
was happening, and I had found
out through everyone else that
he was HIV-positive.

21:36.129 --> 21:42.867
And he didn't feel the need to
discuss it with anyone because
he was so full of shame.

21:42.869 --> 21:47.471
So the stigma with this
issue and this sickness and--
it was just far too much

21:47.473 --> 21:50.541
for him to handle.
I had found out that he
had passed away.

21:50.543 --> 21:55.179
Mm.
When I found out, like,
it wasn't a sense of,

21:55.181 --> 22:00.584
"oh, my God, my life is over."
Like, the first thing was,
"how do we fix it?"

22:00.586 --> 22:05.623
I just knew that there was
so much in life that I wanted
to achieve and that I wasn't

22:05.625 --> 22:09.260
gonna allow HIV
to get in the way.
I really do admire

22:09.262 --> 22:13.531
Trinity for being open and
honest and taking care of
herself the way she does,

22:13.533 --> 22:16.467
because if my friend had
done the same, I think things
would have turned out

22:16.469 --> 22:21.539
differently.
I think what you've done
is an amazing thing,

22:21.541 --> 22:25.576
and if you ever need anything,
call a hateful bitch like me.
[Laughs]

22:25.578 --> 22:29.313
Bianca's secretly adorable

22:29.315 --> 22:30.314
in a certain way.

22:30.316 --> 22:33.651
Like, she's the type of person
where you, like, want to hug
her, and she's just like, "ugh,

22:33.653 --> 22:37.521
get away."
Like, it's very that,
but she loves you.

22:37.523 --> 22:48.299
[Laughing]

22:48.301 --> 22:56.874
Cover girl

And now it's time for the

30:29.995 --> 30:33.063
judge's critiques.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.265
The hip-hop was something

30:35.267 --> 30:35.966
that threw you.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.268
You were not on rhythm, girl.

30:38.270 --> 30:41.071
Don't be a cliche, my dear.

30:41.073 --> 30:51.381
Ladies, this week,
you worked in groups,
but tonight you'll be

30:51.383 --> 30:57.421
judged individually.
Courtney Act.
It's a cliche,

30:57.423 --> 31:05.262
but you're resting on pretty.
Don't be a cliche, my dear.
Courtney Act,

31:05.264 --> 31:13.170
Ben de LA creme,
and Laganja Estranja,
you are safe.

31:13.172 --> 31:16.540
Thank you.
You may leave the stage.

31:16.542 --> 31:26.250
Now it's time for the
judge's critiques.
Let's start with Joslyn Fox.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.618
Your runway look is a

31:27.620 --> 31:28.785
bit busy.

31:28.787 --> 31:32.689
All the layers on top
of layers, it just starts
to get a little messy for me.

31:32.691 --> 31:35.425
I do feel like I tend
to over-accessorize.
[Laughs]

31:35.427 --> 31:39.429
I always love it myself,
but, you know, if you want to
please these bitches up here,

31:39.431 --> 31:43.200
you know, you got to--
[Laughter]
I think your rap was great.

31:43.202 --> 31:47.271
I love "mother-fisher."
[Laughter]
You really stepped up,

31:47.273 --> 31:49.907
and I'm very proud of you.
[Giggles]
Thank you.

31:49.909 --> 31:53.243
All right, next up,

You give me Naomi

31:54.680 --> 31:56.647
Campbell down.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.315
Now let's move to the rap.

31:58.317 --> 32:01.885
The look was really spot-on.
It was salt-n-pepa
meets Anita Baker...

32:01.887 --> 32:04.888
[Laughs]
But you were not on
rhythm, girl.

32:04.890 --> 32:08.692
You freaked yourself out.
You know, I'm--I've never
been the queen to make excuses,

32:08.694 --> 32:12.796
but this is not something
that I'm accustomed to.
I lip-sync for a living.

32:12.798 --> 32:15.032
That's what I do.
All right.
So...

32:15.034 --> 32:20.237
Thank you, Trinity.
Next up, Milk.
The rap wasn't on beat,

32:20.239 --> 32:23.840
but it was your own
personalized uniqueness.
You just went into this

32:23.842 --> 32:27.077
little funny--yeah.
I love that.
That was just so you.

32:27.079 --> 32:30.013
The clothes were way
off for me.
You had, like, Joey buttafuoco

32:30.015 --> 32:33.650
zubaz pants on.
Nothing to do with hip-hop.
Lots to do with the boys I used

32:33.652 --> 32:37.020
to have sex with at the gym.
Tonight, on the runway,
it's great to see you with

32:37.022 --> 32:41.925
pretty makeup on,
but I wouldn't ever turn
around in that skirt again.

32:41.927 --> 32:46.063
It looks like that
sheet's wrapped around you,
pinned in the back.

32:46.065 --> 32:50.100
The attention to detail
needs to be just as on-point
as when you come out here

32:50.102 --> 32:56.573
with a Pinocchio nose.
All right, Darienne Lake.
Well, Darienne, pretty dress.

32:56.575 --> 33:01.011
It's nothing spectacular.
Yesterday, with your
performance, it gave me, like,

33:01.013 --> 33:04.681
missy elliott with a trash bag.
I wanted to see you, like,
bust out of it and, like,

33:04.683 --> 33:08.885
just really give it to us,
but you were a little withheld.
I think the hip-hop

33:08.887 --> 33:14.124
threw you a little bit.
Next up, Bianca Del Rio.
This is probably the most

33:14.126 --> 33:19.396
beautiful I've seen you yet.
Your eye makeup--you didn't
put that harsh white line.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.665
I didn't put it, but I did
snort it.
All right,

33:21.667 --> 33:24.935
at least it was used.
That's why I'm alert, girl.
[Laughter]

33:24.937 --> 33:28.171
Yesterday,
you were hilarious.
Other than the pigtails,

33:28.173 --> 33:32.242
though, you were giving me
kind of urkel.
I disagree, because as

33:32.244 --> 33:36.079
b-girls, that was the look
that we rocked.
And let me remind everybody

33:36.081 --> 33:40.484
that Michelle Visage is also
a rapper.
She had a song on <i>the bodyguard</i>

33:40.486 --> 33:43.120
<i>soundtrack.</i>
<i> Track nine.</i>
<i>Go on.</i>

33:43.122 --> 33:46.456
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> All right, up next,</i>
<i>Adore Delano.</i>

33:46.458 --> 33:50.494
<i> Well, Adore, I'm happy to see</i>
<i>that you have a waist.</i>
<i> But?</i>

33:50.496 --> 33:55.799
<i> But what are we gonna do</i>
<i>about this kind of</i>
<i>mid-shin length.</i>

33:55.801 --> 33:59.836
<i> But I had to wear it</i>
<i>because it was see-through,</i>
<i>and I wanted to show my body.</i>

33:59.838 --> 34:04.908
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> You assassinated the rap.</i>
<i>You were on rhythm.</i>

34:04.910 --> 34:08.445
<i>You were, like,</i>
<i>just a real artist.</i>
<i> Your lyrics were great.</i>

34:08.447 --> 34:11.581
<i>Your attitude was everything.</i>
<i> Yeah, motherfucker.</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

34:11.583 --> 34:16.219
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Well, thank you, ladies.</i>
<i>While you untuck in the</i>

34:16.221 --> 34:20.457
<i>formdecor lounge, the judges</i>
<i>and I will deliberate.</i>

34:20.459 --> 34:26.129
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Now, just between us</i>
<i>freak-nicks, what do you think?</i>

34:26.131 --> 34:31.134
<i>Starting with Joslyn Fox.</i>
<i> Her runway look tonight</i>
<i>was just a disaster.</i>

34:31.136 --> 34:33.437
<i> I don't know how you</i>
<i>can have so much on and</i>
<i>still be--</i>

34:33.439 --> 34:37.040
<i> be that naked?</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> I think she nailed the video.</i>

34:37.042 --> 34:39.709
<i> That was the first time</i>
<i>i felt like I really heard</i>
<i>her voice, and it boomed</i>

34:39.711 --> 34:44.247
<i>through.</i>
<i> All right, Trinity K. Bonet.</i>
<i> In the video, she got her</i>

34:44.249 --> 34:47.150
<i>ghetto pass revoked for</i>
<i>that rap.</i>
<i>For real?</i>

34:47.152 --> 34:50.353
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> And, again, I didn't</i>
<i>understand much of what</i>

34:50.355 --> 34:53.590
<i>she was saying.</i>
<i> I think she gave up</i>
<i>really before she started.</i>

34:53.592 --> 34:55.592
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

34:55.594 --> 34:59.729
<i> Up next, Milk.</i>
<i> I think Milk is really,</i>
<i>really unique and different,</i>

34:59.731 --> 35:04.935
<i>and off, but it works.</i>
<i> However, we asked to see</i>
<i>more from Milk, and this is</i>

35:04.937 --> 35:08.805
<i>what she brought out here</i>
<i>tonight.</i>
<i> Darienne Lake.</i>

35:08.807 --> 35:14.511
<i> Darienne looked lovely</i>
<i>tonight on the runway, but in</i>
<i>the video, her delivery needed</i>

35:14.513 --> 35:17.013
<i>a lot of work.</i>
<i> She seemed very</i>
<i>uncomfortable.</i>

35:17.015 --> 35:21.985
<i>She really wasn't delivering</i>
<i>her performance.</i>
<i> Bianca Del Rio.</i>

35:21.987 --> 35:25.789
<i> On the runway,</i>
<i>she looked incredible.</i>
<i> Her hip-hop thing was</i>

35:25.791 --> 35:29.860
<i>hilarious, 'cause it was on</i>
<i>the comedy side.</i>
<i> But it did get to be a</i>

35:29.862 --> 35:34.097
<i>little dude.</i>
<i> Up next, Adore Delano.</i>
<i> I don't even know what</i>

35:34.099 --> 35:37.334
<i>to say anymore, kids.</i>
<i>Every time I say, "look at</i>
<i>the length," she comes out</i>

35:37.336 --> 35:41.438
<i>the next week in</i>
<i>the same length.</i>
<i> Yesterday, she came out</i>

35:41.440 --> 35:45.709
<i>from the very beginning and</i>
<i>just slayed it.</i>
<i> Tens all the way.</i>

35:45.711 --> 35:50.113
<i>Look, attitude, character,</i>
<i>personal--everything.</i>
<i> The question is--</i>

35:50.115 --> 35:54.284
<i> all right!</i>
<i>Silence!</i>
<i>I've made my decision.</i>

35:54.286 --> 35:59.789
<i>Bring back my homegirls.</i>
<i>And, uh...</i>
<i> oh, no, she better don't </i>

35:59.791 --> 36:04.895
<i> yeah!</i>
<i>  oh, no, she better don't </i>
<i>  oh, no, she better don't </i>

36:04.897 --> 36:06.963
<i> [laughs]</i>

36:06.965 --> 36:17.541
<i> Welcome back, ladies.</i>
<i>I've made some decisions.</i>
<i>Bianca Del Rio...</i>

36:17.543 --> 36:24.381
<i>You are safe.</i>
<i>Adore Delano...</i>
<i>This week, you pushed it</i>

36:24.383 --> 36:28.885
<i>real good.</i>
<i>You are the winner of this</i>
<i>week's challenge.</i>

36:28.887 --> 36:34.758
<i>[Applause]</i>
<i>And you've won a collection</i>
<i>of custom-made jewelry from</i>

36:34.760 --> 36:39.896
<i>the foundry.</i>
<i> Jesus knows I need it.</i>
<i>I won finally.</i>

36:39.898 --> 36:42.899
<i>I'm motherfucking legit.</i>

36:42.901 --> 36:46.069
<i> Joslyn, you're safe.</i>

36:46.071 --> 36:56.446
<i> Trinity K. Bonet,</i>
<i>mc t.K.B. Was not a t.K.O.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, my dear,</i>

36:56.448 --> 37:06.823
<i>but you are up for elimination.</i>
<i>Milk, your rap and runway</i>
<i>look were not mc supreme.</i>

37:06.825 --> 37:14.731
<i>Darienne Lake, your performance</i>
<i>as mc control top was no</i>
<i>rapper's delight.</i>

37:14.733 --> 37:17.133
<i>Darienne Lake...</i>

37:17.135 --> 37:24.641
<i>You are safe.</i>
<i> [Exhales sharply]</i>
<i> You may join the other girls.</i>

37:24.643 --> 37:29.512
<i>Milk, I'm sorry, my dear,</i>
<i>but you are up for</i>
<i>elimination.</i>

37:29.514 --> 37:37.087
<i>Two queens stand before me.</i>
<i>Ladies, this is your last chance</i>
<i>to impress me and save</i>

37:37.089 --> 37:39.623
<i>yourself from elimination.</i>

37:39.625 --> 37:48.898
<i>The time has come.</i>
<i>You need to lip-sync</i>
<i>for your life!</i>

37:48.900 --> 37:54.004
<i>I didn't expect to be in</i>

37:54.006 --> 37:55.772
<i>the bottom two, but I'm gonna</i>

37:55.774 --> 37:56.873
<i>work it out.</i>

37:56.875 --> 38:01.378
<i> Good luck,</i>
<i>and don't fuck it up.</i>

38:01.380 --> 38:02.412
<i>  Ooh, what a man </i>

38:02.414 --> 38:03.913
<i> what a man, what a man </i>

38:03.915 --> 38:05.348
<i> what a mighty good man </i>

38:05.350 --> 38:06.116
<i>  yeah </i>

38:06.118 --> 38:06.783
<i>  I want to take </i>

38:06.785 --> 38:07.784
<i> a minute or two </i>

38:07.786 --> 38:11.621
<i> and give much respect to </i>
<i> to the man that's made </i>
<i> a difference in my world </i>

38:11.623 --> 38:14.924
<i> and although most men </i>
<i> are hos </i>
<i> he flows on the down-low </i>

38:14.926 --> 38:17.494
<i> 'cause I never heard </i>
<i> about him </i>
<i> with another girl </i>

38:17.496 --> 38:20.664
<i> but I don't sweat it </i>
<i> because it's just pathetic </i>
<i> to let it </i>

38:20.666 --> 38:23.833
<i> get me involved </i>
<i> in that he said, she said </i>
<i> crowd </i>

38:23.835 --> 38:26.636
<i> I know that ain't </i>
<i> nobody perfect </i>
<i> I give props to those </i>

38:26.638 --> 38:29.306
<i> who deserve it </i>
<i> and believe me, y'all </i>
<i> he's worth it </i>

38:29.308 --> 38:33.476
<i>  what a man </i>
<i> what a man, what a man </i>
<i> what a mighty good man </i>

38:33.478 --> 38:36.680
<i>  my man is smooth </i>
<i> like Barry </i>
<i> and his voice got bass </i>

38:36.682 --> 38:40.917
<i> a body like Arnold </i>
<i> with a Denzel face </i>
<i> Milk is high-energy.</i>

38:40.919 --> 38:45.755
<i>She is so weird and so wild.</i>
<i>It's just totally Milk.</i>
<i>  he never ran </i>

38:45.757 --> 38:50.093
<i> a corny line once to me yet </i>
<i> so I give him stuff </i>
<i> that he'll never forget </i>

38:50.095 --> 38:54.397
<i> yes, my man says he loves me </i>
<i> never says he loves me not </i>
<i> tryin' to rush me good </i>

38:54.399 --> 38:56.900
<i> and touch me </i>
<i> in the right spot </i>
<i> Trinity's really serving it</i>

38:56.902 --> 38:59.836
<i>she looks fucking</i>

38:59.838 --> 39:02.806
<i>bomb.Com.Org.Co.Uk.</i>

39:02.808 --> 39:03.573
<i>  He's got me open </i>

39:03.575 --> 39:07.110
<i> like 7-Eleven </i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> that he's always choosin' </i>

39:07.112 --> 39:10.580
<i> with him I'm never losin' </i>
<i> and he knows that my name </i>
<i> is not Susan </i>

39:10.582 --> 39:14.517
<i> he always has heavy </i>
<i> conversation for the mind </i>
<i> which means a lot to me </i>

39:14.519 --> 39:17.187
<i> 'cause good men </i>
<i> are hard to find </i>
<i>  ooh, what a man </i>

39:17.189 --> 39:19.522
<i> what a man, what a man </i>
<i> what a mighty good man </i>

39:19.524 --> 39:20.190
<i>  oh</i>

39:20.192 --> 39:22.459
I said what a mighty

39:22.461 --> 39:26.262
[laughing]
[Applause]

39:26.264 --> 39:31.801
Ladies, I've made my decision.

39:31.803 --> 39:47.417
Trinity K. Bonet,
shante, you stay.
[Light applause]

39:47.419 --> 39:54.791
My dear Milk, you've
consistently shown us that
you can think outside

39:54.793 --> 40:01.064
the carton.
I just want to thank you
so much for allowing me to be

40:01.066 --> 40:06.836
who I am without fear
of being ridiculed.
Thank you.

40:06.838 --> 40:16.312
And in my heart, it will
always be milking time.
Now, sashay away.

40:16.314 --> 40:24.654
[Applause]
[Chuckles]
I wanted to leave my stamp,

40:24.656 --> 40:30.293
and I really think I did.
I'm so happy with what
I've shown the world,

40:30.295 --> 40:37.066
and I'm excited to keep
going and for people to love
my drag as much as I do.

40:37.068 --> 40:43.473
Can I get my phone back?
[Laughs]
My crazy eight queens,

40:43.475 --> 40:48.244
condragulations.
Now, remember, if you can't love
yourself, how in the hell you

40:48.246 --> 40:51.748
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
All: Amen.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.584
All right.
Now, let the music play!
[Rupaul's <i>dance with u]</i>

40:54.586 --> 40:59.355
<i></i>
I want to dance, dance
I want to dance, dance

40:59.357 --> 41:03.726
I want to dance, dance
dance with you
