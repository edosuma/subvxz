  ADULT ADAM:
 <i> When you were a kid,</i>
 <i> cracking open a toy catalog</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:06.538
  <i> and making your holiday</i>
  <i> wish list was the most</i>
  <i> exciting part of the year.</i>

00:06.540 --> 00:07.973
   <i> But now that</i>
   <i> I was a ninth-grade man,</i>

00:07.975 --> 00:11.243
      <i> I wanted something</i>
      <i> you couldn't find</i>
      <i> in any store.</i>

00:11.245 --> 00:13.946
           Psst! Yo!
           Goldnerd, Come here.

00:13.948 --> 00:16.882
             You got the money,
             I got the hook-up.
 Let me see it first.

00:16.884 --> 00:17.850
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> Christmas came early.</i>

00:17.852 --> 00:21.020
<i> He had</i>
<i> a bootleg copy of the</i>
 Star Wars Holiday Special.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.355
 Holy Kenobi!
 The legend is true!

00:23.357 --> 00:25.224
        This is the rarest film
        in existence.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.525
          Only aired once
          in the lame-ass '70s.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.728
 Give me, give me, give me!
       Pleasure doing business.
       Enjoy your space wars.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.800
 Stop what you're doing.
 I have the biggest
 holiday news of all time.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.001
              If I were to stop
              what I'm doing,

00:36.003 --> 00:37.569
       it'd be more than
       what I'm actually doing.
    Okay.

00:37.571 --> 00:42.941
  So, as everyone knows,
<i> Star Wars</i> is my entire life,
  soul, and universe.

00:42.943 --> 00:43.876
             (SNORES)

00:43.878 --> 00:44.843
     (CLAPS)
     No dozing!

00:44.845 --> 00:46.245
            Well, then be
            less boring.
 Boring?

00:46.247 --> 00:50.115
  This is two hours' worth
  of unseen
<i> Star Wars</i> goodness.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.917
          <i> Star Wars.</i>
           Is that the one
           with the bear?

00:51.919 --> 00:54.386
     I mean, I even heard rumor
     we meet Chewie's family.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.456
        Chuy? The guy who works
        in my stock room?
        No, Chewbacca.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.092
        Is he the little guy
        who yells,
        "The plane, the plane"?

01:00.094 --> 01:02.928
     No, the Wookiee?
     Han Solo's fuzz ball?

01:02.930 --> 01:04.063
       (IMITATES CHEWBACCA)

01:04.065 --> 01:07.066

      No dozing!

   <i> � I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:11.472 --> 01:15.407
    <i> � But nonetheless</i>
    <i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:17.745 --> 01:18.710
  <i> � I don't know the future</i>

01:18.712 --> 01:22.815
 <i> � But the past keeps getting</i>
 <i> clearer every day �</i>

01:23.184 --> 01:25.250
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> It was December 14th,</i>
    <i> 1980-something,</i>

01:25.252 --> 01:28.754
 <i> and that meant one thing,</i>
 <i> the school holiday concert.</i>

01:28.756 --> 01:30.889
      <i> � Joy to the world</i>

01:30.891 --> 01:31.857

  <i> � Deck the halls</i>

01:36.363 --> 01:39.231
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> Yep. We did all the fun</i>
   <i> Christmas classics.</i>

01:39.233 --> 01:40.632
     <i> We also did</i>
     <i> one half-assed tune</i>

01:40.634 --> 01:41.900
    <i> to give a shout-out</i>
    <i> to the other holiday.</i>

01:41.902 --> 01:46.138
 <i> � Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel</i>
 <i> I made it out of clay</i>

01:46.140 --> 01:50.476

            (SNAPS)

01:52.079 --> 01:54.913
            You need something?
 Yeah, it's the second verse.
 That's you.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.549
                 That's a pass.
 But it's the Hanukkah solo.
 You do it every year.

01:57.551 --> 02:01.653
            I think the other,
            way better Goldberg
            should do the solo.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.154
                      Check it.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.422
  (RAPPING)
 <i> � Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel</i>

02:03.424 --> 02:05.290
   <i> � I made it out of... �</i>
    Nope. Can't do it.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.326
 I can't make it cool.
 It's impossible.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.526
     Thank you
     for that journey.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.997
 Erica, if you didn't want
 the solo, then why did you
 sign up for it?

02:11.999 --> 02:14.666
                 I didn't.
    (CHUCKLES)
    Oh, yes, you did.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.501
   With a glitter pen.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.301
              ERICA: That's not
              my handwriting.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.438
         'Cause I would never
         dot the "I" in "Erica"
         with a heart.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.740
            Oh, she is so dead!

02:21.742 --> 02:22.608
                        You.
   Love me?

02:22.610 --> 02:25.377
 Oh, my little schmoopaloo.
    Don't you "schmoopaloo" me.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.247
       What gives you the right
       to forge my name
       on a sign-up sheet?

02:28.249 --> 02:29.448
 It was on the
 bulletin board.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.451
 All the solos were
 taken except
 for "Dreidel Cubed."

02:32.453 --> 02:35.254
 That's what
 the hip cats call it.
          No one calls it that.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.890
      The song isn't hip,
      and I'm tired
      of singing it every year.

02:37.892 --> 02:42.161
 Fine, then you go in
 and tell your grandfather
 and break his sweet heart.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.262
 He lives
 for that Hanukkah solo.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.831
 If you don't sing it,
 you'll literally kill
 that poor, old man.

02:45.833 --> 02:49.768
         I knew you'd say that.
 Way to kill your grandfather
 and Hanukkah, Erica.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.639
        This is just
        your classic mom guilt.
        It won't work.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.073
 Pops, we need to talk.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.708
            Of course, darling.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.344
              How can I make
              your life better?

03:00.881 --> 03:02.381
              Damn you.
              He's so adorable.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.482
 So, you'll sing it.
                      Nope.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.550
           And if you have
           a problem with that,

03:04.552 --> 03:08.120
            then you can just
            ask Barry to do it.
   Barry? Please.

03:08.122 --> 03:09.555
      Just heard my name.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.690
     What am I not
     supposed to be hearing?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.926
        Surprise party?
        Award show?

03:13.928 --> 03:15.494
   Surprise award show party?

03:15.496 --> 03:18.764
 Honey, if I told you,
 it wouldn't be
 a surprise, would it?

03:18.766 --> 03:19.831
     Damn it.
     That logic checks out.

03:19.833 --> 03:23.368
       Well, I'm gonna go
       find my tuxedo T-shirt
       for no reason

03:23.370 --> 03:25.637
     and be back around 6:00,
     wink, wink.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.272
            Looks like
            my solo's the least
            of your problems

03:27.274 --> 03:31.610
    now that you have to throw
    a surprise award show party
    in 45 minutes.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.045
        ADULT ADAM:
       <i> As Erica ditched</i>
       <i> her solo,</i>

03:33.047 --> 03:36.648
  <i> I uncovered</i>
  <i> the mystery to the</i>

03:36.650 --> 03:38.116
       <i> It wasn't great.</i>

03:38.118 --> 03:39.318
         Wow.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.119
 That was so...cool.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.854
          Were we watching
          two different things?

03:42.856 --> 03:44.156
 You don't know <i> Star Wars.</i>

03:44.158 --> 03:46.425
 This special is really
 for the true fan.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.192
              So, the true fan

03:47.194 --> 03:50.996
         wants to watch Dorothy
         from <i> The Golden Girls</i>
         flirt with an alien?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.765
 (STUTTERS) Okay,
 I admit it was
 an odd choice

03:53.767 --> 03:56.401
 to have Bea Arthur
 manage the cantina.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.102
    Let's just move on.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.503
          And what's the deal
          with Lumpy and Itchy?

03:58.505 --> 04:00.973
 Chewie's family
 had to be named something.

04:00.975 --> 04:01.506
            Lumpy and Itchy?

04:01.508 --> 04:04.710
          Couldn't they have
          spent 15 more seconds
          on the names?

04:04.712 --> 04:05.611
     I don't know!

04:05.613 --> 04:08.513
 And I don't know
 why Art Carney
 is a family friend

04:08.515 --> 04:11.450
 or why Jefferson Starship
 is performing
 for the Empire.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.720
      Starship's in their name.
      That one actually
      makes sense to me.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.887
 Let's never
 speak of this again.

04:15.889 --> 04:19.057
        So, you didn't love it.
        Who cares?
          I care!

04:19.059 --> 04:21.560
    I love <i> Star Wars.</i>
    It's my life!

04:21.562 --> 04:24.363
      It makes no sense
      why I didn't
      love this, too.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.931
       It happens to every kid.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.899
           The older you get,
           the more you realize

04:27.901 --> 04:31.003
            that all the things
            you loved as a boy
            are pointless.

04:31.005 --> 04:33.205
       Are you saying
       I'm, like...

04:33.207 --> 04:35.274
   Losing my sense
   of childlike wonder?

04:35.276 --> 04:38.343
               Well, you're not
               a child anymore,
               so, yes.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.911
               And frankly,
               it's about time.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.346
              It happened to me
              when I was six.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.216
  (SOFTLY) Six?
             My dad lost a bet.
             We slept in a car.

04:44.218 --> 04:46.785
          It was a whole thing.
          Hey, good talk.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.264
          in Montgomery County?
 What's gonna happen to me
 right now?

04:59.266 --> 05:00.699
            Well, all that's
            happening right now

05:00.701 --> 05:03.302
     is that this blondie
     brought you some blondies.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.604
          I even sprinkled
          some cinnamon on top.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.105
       It's us in dessert form.

05:07.107 --> 05:11.109
 That's very nice.
 I'm just, um, gonna go ahead
 and open this door

05:11.111 --> 05:13.011
 to make sure that people
 know I'm okay.
                   Oh, come on.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.481
   Everything's just peachy.
   Here. Have a bite of us.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.216
      Go on.
      Put it in your face.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.018
                Yum, yum.
       Mmm.

05:20.020 --> 05:20.385
 Mmm!

05:20.387 --> 05:23.422
 I guess
 we are friends now.
               Best friends.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.791
               And while you're
               chewing on that,
               chew on this.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.093
              You're gonna give
              Erica a solo
              or it's your ass.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.263
 I knew it!
 These blondies aren't just
 sprinkled with cinnamon,

05:31.265 --> 05:33.098
 they're sprinkled
 with deceit.
                Oh, give it up.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.700
              Erica has to sing
              about Hanukkah.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.668
     It's what her grandpa
     looks forward to all year.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.172
 I tried. She's just not
 down with the dreidel.
 End of story.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.342
            Well, there must be
            one other fun
            Hanukkah song.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.510
                     Think.
 There's this one.

05:46.647 --> 05:50.349
 (SINGING <i> MA'OZ TZUR</i>
 IN HEBREW)

05:51.251 --> 05:52.284
            Okay, you just spit
            all over me.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.620
 There is that one about
 being frugal with oil.
          I hate you right now.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.089
 Oh! I know! There's that
 lively little one

05:57.091 --> 06:00.125
 about trying to escape
 the Greeks.
               No! It's all no!

06:00.127 --> 06:02.828
             (SIGHS)
             I guess I'll just
             have to coax Erica

06:02.830 --> 06:04.529
           into writing her own
           Hanukkah song,

06:04.531 --> 06:06.331
          and she'll knock
          everyone's socks off.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.432
 I like your moxie,
 but I'm pretty sure

06:07.434 --> 06:11.603
 that Hanukkah has been
 around for a while, and no one
 has cracked that nut yet.

06:12.973 --> 06:13.472
       I bit that top one.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.875
   ADULT ADAM: <i> And so,</i>
  <i> my mom went to give Erica</i>
  <i> something to chew on.</i>

06:16.877 --> 06:19.177
 Hey, boopie.
 Whatcha doing?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.645
          Just noodling
          on a new song.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.646
    Oh, yeah?
    What's it about?

06:21.648 --> 06:23.081
         A boy who can't see
         what's right
         in front of him.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.518
 Well, I know a pretty cool
 boy you could
 write a song about.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.653
                 Who?
 Judah Maccabee.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.521
         Does he go to Lincoln?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.656
 No, he's been dead
 for 2,000 years.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.526
                   Ew!
 And he's the hunky warrior
 who saved Hanukkah!

06:34.528 --> 06:37.729
 He booted the Greeks
 out of the temple
 in Jerusalem.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.165
     He's the reason
     for the season.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.800
          This is starting
          to sound like school.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.335
   Come on.
   This is for Pops.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.203
 You're so talented
 at writing songs.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.304
      Share your gift
      with the world!

06:46.306 --> 06:50.475
 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
 If anyone in this family
 is gifted at music-ing,

06:50.477 --> 06:52.577
 it's Big Tasty.
            Okay,
            if he's doing this,

06:52.579 --> 06:53.845
          then clearly
          it's a dead-end road.
          I'm out.

06:53.847 --> 06:59.317
 Kids, there's no need to fight
 over who's gonna write
 the perfect Hanukkah song.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.486
         Although Barry
         does seem
         to want it more.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.688
       Yes! Barry wins!
       In your face!

07:03.690 --> 07:05.357
             You're just trying
             to pit us against
             each other

07:05.359 --> 07:07.793
          so I write you a song
          out of spite.
          It won't work.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.495
 (MOCKINGLY)
 You're just trying to pit us
 against each other

07:10.497 --> 07:12.030
     so meow, meow,
     meow, meow.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.065
          Idiot, you're playing
          into her plan.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.667
  Meow, meow, meow,
  meow, meow, meow, meow.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.802
 (NORMAL VOICE)
 You're a cat, basically.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.605
 "Meow, meow, meow, meow.
 I'm Garfield.
 I love lasagna!"

07:20.607 --> 07:22.474
              Ugh!
              You're so stupid!
              Fine!

07:22.476 --> 07:24.876
         I will write
         a better song than you
         with my eyes closed.

07:24.878 --> 07:28.346
 Oh, yeah?
 Well, this will be the song
 that puts me on the map.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.048
 I'm guaranteed
 to make millions
 off of it.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.918
           Millions? By writing
           a Hanukkah song?
 Think about it.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.188
 What's the greatest
 cash cow of our time?
 Give up?

07:36.190 --> 07:37.389
 It's <i> Happy Birthday.</i>
                Wait.

07:37.391 --> 07:40.625
      <i> � Happy birthday to you,</i>
      <i> happy birthday to you �</i>

07:40.627 --> 07:41.426
            Dude, no one
            owns that song.

07:41.428 --> 07:45.163
 Wrong.
 Two little old ladies
 wrote it 100 years ago.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.600
 Now every time
 it's sung on TV
 or movies,

07:48.602 --> 07:51.937
  they get $50,000.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.538
    <i> � Happy birthday</i>
    <i> to you... �</i>

07:53.540 --> 07:55.207
 Boom!
     That's another $50,000.

07:55.209 --> 07:59.244
  Well, now I'm gonna be
  the birthday guy
  for Hanukkah.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.147
    Ka-ching!
    In your stupid face.

08:02.149 --> 08:02.481
                      In yours!

08:02.483 --> 08:05.283
       I'm gonna write the best
       damn Hanukkah song
       this world's ever seen,

08:05.285 --> 08:07.786
      because you suck
      and you make me very bad.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.756
            Yay!
            The Hanukkah spirit
            is alive!

08:16.196 --> 08:18.063
                Hey, kiddo.
                What's shaking?

08:18.065 --> 08:20.198
    What's shaking
    is <i> Ghostbusters II.</i>

08:20.200 --> 08:21.833
           It's riddled
           with logic problems.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.837
         Since when can you use
         magic slime and a
         Nintendo controller

08:25.839 --> 08:27.906
        to make the
        Statue of Liberty walk?

08:27.908 --> 08:30.108
    Since the ghost fellas
    can do anything.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.443
     Why are you being
     so hard on them?

08:31.445 --> 08:33.111
        After I watched
        that <i> Star Wars</i> special,

08:33.113 --> 08:35.647
        I've been re-evaluating
        all the things
        I loved as a child.

08:35.649 --> 08:39.351
 Don't do that.
       All the movies I worship
       have come into question.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.219
 Don't do that.
              <i> Short Circuit 2,</i>

08:41.221 --> 08:46.024
       <i> Time Bandits,</i> and don't
        even get me started on
       <i> Jaws 4: The Revenge.</i>

08:46.026 --> 08:47.993
         Now, stop right there.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.428
                I know you love
                that movie.
            Until now!

08:50.430 --> 08:52.998
 Why would a shark swim
 from New England
 to The Bahamas

08:53.000 --> 08:56.401
 to eat a lady
 whose husband
 killed his shark friend?

08:56.403 --> 08:57.869
          Sharks have feelings,
          too.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.771
            "This time,
            it's personal."

08:59.773 --> 09:00.772
          How's that possible?

09:00.774 --> 09:03.108
      It's a fish!
      Fish don't hold grudges.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.110
         Oh, so now
         you're a shark expert.

09:05.112 --> 09:08.346
    All these years,
    I was a child
    who blindly loved

09:08.348 --> 09:12.617
 anything put
 in front of him,
 but now I'm a man.

09:13.086 --> 09:13.585
    And it's all gotta go.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.054
     ADULT ADAM: <i> And, so,</i>
    <i> I'd throw away</i>
    <i> my childhood forever,</i>

09:16.056 --> 09:19.057
<i> which would be</i>
<i> harder than I thought.</i>
                Oh!

09:19.159 --> 09:21.927
        <i> Yep.</i>
        <i> This was gonna</i>
        <i> take a while.</i>

09:21.929 --> 09:22.360
            Damn it!

09:22.362 --> 09:25.931
        I'm going downstairs
        and finding a trash can
        for men.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.869
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> As the holiday concert</i>
    <i> got closer,</i>

09:30.871 --> 09:33.204
  <i> my mom had a perfect plan</i>
  <i> to land Erica a solo.</i>

09:33.206 --> 09:37.609
          So, I know I told you
          we'd be working on
          a new Hanukkah song,

09:37.611 --> 09:40.111
            but we actually
            don't have one.
            (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

09:40.113 --> 09:40.879
            We have two.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.682
          Erica,
          delight our ears.
                        Okay.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.450
      Well, I don't want
      to build it up too much,

09:45.452 --> 09:49.588
 but prepare yourselves
 for the greatest Hanukkah song
 ever written.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.325
     (PLAYING PIANO)
     <i> � Oh, yeah...</i>

09:53.627 --> 09:57.429
<i> � Hanu, Ha-Ha-Hanu</i>

09:57.431 --> 09:59.064
       <i> � Hanukkah</i>

09:59.066 --> 10:00.665
     <i> � I'm a-wishin'</i>

10:00.667 --> 10:02.434
     <i> � I'm-a wishin'...</i>

10:02.436 --> 10:05.437
<i> � A happy Hanukkah to you</i>

10:05.439 --> 10:08.373
  <i> � A happy Hanukkah to you</i>

10:08.375 --> 10:13.311
      <i> � Happy Hanukkah,</i>
      <i> dear everyone</i>

10:13.313 --> 10:17.015
<i> � Happy Hanukkah to you �</i>

10:17.017 --> 10:18.516
             Yeah, that's
             the birthday song.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.284
           Not fair, cheater.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.687
         I can't use that song.
         I will have to pay
         those old ladies

10:22.689 --> 10:24.389
          hundreds of thousands
          of dollars,

10:24.391 --> 10:25.757
         and I've already spent
         our entire budget

10:25.759 --> 10:27.325
          on construction paper
          for the snowflakes.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.160
        How could you
        let this happen, Erica?

10:29.162 --> 10:32.030
             All you had to do
             was write
             a timeless classic

10:32.032 --> 10:33.632
      that would last for ages.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.866
     I got you covered, Mom.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.735
       JTP, drop the beat.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.503
       (BOTH BEATBOXING)

10:38.505 --> 10:41.439
  (RAPPING)<i> � How did Hanukkah</i>
<i> start, you all wonder</i>

10:41.441 --> 10:43.775
         <i> � Judah Maccabee,</i>
         <i> dinosaur hunter</i>

10:43.777 --> 10:46.311

10:46.313 --> 10:49.080

<i> � For eight straight days �</i>

10:49.082 --> 10:50.081
   Wow.
                          What?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.650
              Education, y'all!

10:51.652 --> 10:53.818
          While I really do
          appreciate the effort

10:53.820 --> 10:56.021
       even though, uh,
       one song was plagiarized

10:56.023 --> 10:58.690
        and the other one
        was factually insane...

10:58.692 --> 10:59.457
             You are insane.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.861
      I added dinosaurs
      to a holiday about lamps.

11:02.863 --> 11:03.728
              It's called
              spicing it up.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.497
   Look, the "Dreidel" song
   was our only option

11:05.499 --> 11:08.099
 and, truthfully, none of this
 was worth the hassle.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.634
       You can't do this to me!

11:09.636 --> 11:10.735
             To Pops.
             This is about him.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.505
     Not my problem.
     The "Dreidel" song is cut.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.606
    But I have more sick rhymes

11:14.608 --> 11:17.909
          about a dreideldactyl
          and menorahsaurus.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.277
  They're dino-Hanukkah hybrids

11:19.279 --> 11:21.112
            who break-dance
            and fight crime.

11:21.114 --> 11:21.546
               Oh, ho!

11:21.548 --> 11:24.149
     (RAPPING)<i> � Yo, yo, yo,</i>
    <i> I'm a dreideldacty �</i>

11:24.151 --> 11:26.785
       And I'm also late,
       aren't I?

11:26.787 --> 11:28.553
               �

11:28.555 --> 11:29.287
        Hey.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.022
 I got something big
 to show Adam.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.323
    Where is he?
                  Upstairs.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.225
    He said he was gonna
    tear down his movie posters

11:34.227 --> 11:36.227
       now that his whole world
       has gone to crap.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.162
              Blah, blah, blah.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.630
       I was making a sandwich.
     What?

11:38.632 --> 11:40.498
 Why didn't you stop him?
                  Stop him?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.200
           I told him
           this was about time.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.101
     This happens to everybody.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.869
         It just took him
         a few years longer.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.772
     Having unreasonable,
     childlike wonder

11:47.774 --> 11:49.140
   is what makes Adam Adam.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.709
      It's what
      I love about the boy.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.610
           I guess from now on,
           Adam isn't Adam.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.913
           We'll call him Gary.
 Who the hell's Gary?

11:54.915 --> 11:55.914
               Gary's the kid
               in Adam's class

11:55.916 --> 11:59.084
  who's really good at baseball
  and rides the moped.

11:59.086 --> 11:59.984
                Ah, Gary.

11:59.986 --> 12:03.188
          So normal.
          So good at shortstop.

12:03.190 --> 12:03.788
 I'm gonna show Adam

12:03.790 --> 12:06.458
 that there's still plenty
 of wonder left in this world,

12:06.460 --> 12:10.028
 and you'll have to get off
 your tuchas to stop me.

12:10.497 --> 12:14.332
            Eh. Well played,
            old man.
            Well played.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.134
   Kiddo,
   you're coming with me.

12:16.136 --> 12:19.604
 I got something fantastic
 you're guaranteed to love.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.240
                 I'm good.
 Well, imagine
 if they made a movie

12:22.242 --> 12:24.375
     with your favorite
     moving-picture maker,

12:24.377 --> 12:26.811
          George Lucas.
         The Great Bearded One?

12:26.813 --> 12:28.346
    And what if Mr. Lucas
    then cast

12:28.348 --> 12:32.150
 that foxy Lea Thompson
 from <i> Back in the Future?</i>

12:32.152 --> 12:32.884
        I'm slightly listening.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.587
      And what if I told you
      this very movie

12:35.589 --> 12:38.623
       was from the writer
       of <i> Indiana Jones?</i>

12:38.625 --> 12:39.524
            I'm an adult now.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.860
      I know
      it's simply not possible.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.061
       And yet it is,

12:43.063 --> 12:45.830
     and it's playing
     at the Hiway Theater.

12:45.832 --> 12:50.001
 If this movie can't restore
 your faith in dreaming,

12:50.003 --> 12:50.468
 then nothing will.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.505
  ADULT ADAM: <i> As always,</i>
 <i> Pops was a man of his word.</i>

12:53.507 --> 12:54.339
      Hi. Uh, three tickets

12:54.341 --> 12:55.707
     for the movie
     about the talking duck.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.443
<i> Except he took me to</i>
<i> the biggest flop of the '80s.</i>

12:58.445 --> 13:02.447
           You know, I only see
           one movie a year.
           This better be good.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.648
 It's George Lucas!

13:03.650 --> 13:05.550
 I bet everyone in school's
 gonna see it.

13:05.552 --> 13:08.253
 Well, except the other
 Adam Goldberg in 11th grade.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.255
   He only goes to
   that cinema downtown

13:10.257 --> 13:11.456
              that serves wine.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.191
  It's been brought
  to my attention

13:13.193 --> 13:14.425
 that the
 "Dreidel Cubed" song

13:14.427 --> 13:15.960
 has been cut
 from the holiday concert.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.129
             Honestly,
             it's for the best.
     It's not.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.063
   We got to do
   the "Dreidel."

13:19.065 --> 13:20.732
           She's gotten to you,
           hasn't she?
 She who?

13:20.734 --> 13:23.101
       She is standing
       right outside that door,

13:23.103 --> 13:24.502
            isn't she?
        Yes.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.938
        So, here's the thing,
        Cinnabuns,

13:26.940 --> 13:29.641
       this Quaker school
       was founded on the basis

13:29.643 --> 13:32.710
     that everyone deserves
     a festive holiday song.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.145
  You can't have
  a holiday concert

13:34.147 --> 13:35.713
   without
   any Cha-nukkah songs.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.482
   Just pick another one.
                 Sure, Earl.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.850
           Uh, how about one of
           the famous ones

13:38.852 --> 13:39.717
              recorded by,
              oh, I don't know,

13:39.719 --> 13:41.953
              Barry Manilow
              or Neil Diamond?
      Perfect.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.087
              They only did
              Christmas songs.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.689
      Even they knew
      what the audience wanted.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.925
 Well, look, if you don't do
 any Cha-nukkah songs,

13:46.927 --> 13:49.194
  then you can't do
  any Christmas songs, either.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.628
      Okay, this is
      going off the rails.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.896
       If we can't mention
       the holidays,

13:51.898 --> 13:54.065
     what are the kids
     supposed to sing about?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.667
  Oh, I don't know.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.901
 The weather? Mittens?

13:56.903 --> 14:00.438
 The damn plow guy
 that always
 skips your street?

14:00.440 --> 14:01.206
 I'm paying you!

14:01.208 --> 14:03.107
 You think of something,
 damn it!

14:03.109 --> 14:05.143
            Well, you've robbed
            the children
            of the holidays.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.611
           I hope you're happy.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.146
         In my defense,

14:08.148 --> 14:10.081
       I was only trying
       to undermine you.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.916
  ADULT ADAM: <i> As my mom killed</i>
 <i> the holiday concert,</i>

14:11.918 --> 14:14.252
<i> I was bringing my</i>
<i> childlike wonder back to life</i>

14:14.254 --> 14:16.955
       <i> with a brand-new</i>
       <i> legendary movie.</i>

14:16.957 --> 14:18.022
       <i> Or so I thought.</i>

14:18.024 --> 14:21.059
           Like they say, doll,
           love's strange.

14:21.061 --> 14:25.230
               We could always
               give it a try.
 LEA THOMPSON: Okay.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.599
  Let's go for it,
  Mr. Macho.

14:27.601 --> 14:28.933
      What am I watching!

14:28.935 --> 14:31.102
          Come on.
          The duck is like E.T.

14:31.104 --> 14:31.769
      He just wants to go home.

14:31.771 --> 14:35.406
   Then how come
   he's spending so much time
   managing that band?

14:35.408 --> 14:37.242
 Al, the duck's gonna
 make it with that lady.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.144
 What have
 you brought us to?
                 A family film.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.913
          It's a family film.

14:41.915 --> 14:42.981
   I can't watch this anymore.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.450
 Well, then let's go.
             Really?
             We can do that?

14:45.452 --> 14:46.517
 It's about time you learned

14:46.519 --> 14:48.586
 that an adult
 can walk out of anything

14:48.588 --> 14:50.555
 and demand
 his damn money back.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.656
 I do it once a year.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.291
 Let's go.
                      Adam, no!

14:53.293 --> 14:55.226
             It's not that bad.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.161
      A lady and a duck in bed?

14:57.163 --> 15:01.299
        Who the (BLEEP) thought
        this was a good idea?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.469
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> It was the final rehearsal</i>

15:04.471 --> 15:05.870
   <i> for the big non-holiday</i>
   <i> holiday concert.</i>

15:05.872 --> 15:06.838
    (TO TUNE OF <i> WE WISH YOU</i>
   <i> A MERRY CHRISTMAS)</i>

15:06.840 --> 15:10.909
  <i> � We wish a snowy Tuesday,</i>
  <i> we wish you a snowy Tuesday</i>

15:10.911 --> 15:14.712
 <i> � We wish you a snowy Tuesday</i>
 <i> and a cozy weekend �</i>

15:14.714 --> 15:20.151
  (TO TUNE OF <i> SILENT NIGHT)</i>

15:20.153 --> 15:23.821
  (TO TUNE OF <i> O CHRISTMAS TREE)</i>
<i> � O winter time,</i>
<i> O winter time</i>

15:23.823 --> 15:25.990
   <i> � You come before spring</i>
   <i> and after fall �</i>

     <i> � His flight gets in</i>

15:32.032 --> 15:33.865
          Okay, what the hell's
          going on?

15:33.867 --> 15:36.301
             Why are we singing
             terrible songs
             about the weather

15:36.303 --> 15:37.502
              and someone's
              weird Uncle Doug?

15:37.504 --> 15:39.871
         Doug is my uncle
         and he lives in Ohio

15:39.873 --> 15:40.772
   and he helps me pay my rent.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.975
     And without naming names,
     we are singing
     about the weather

15:43.977 --> 15:45.343
  because of Beverly Goldberg.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.144
      Oops. I let it slip.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.313
          Wait. This is
          your hot mom's fault?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.548
         (ALL BOOING)

15:50.550 --> 15:51.115
        Um, Miss Cinoman,

15:51.117 --> 15:53.251
   can you not just sit there
   and let them boo at us?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.553
 Yeah, I'm only used to
 wild cheering and hearing,

15:55.555 --> 15:58.556
  "Aw, yeah, Barry!
  You the man!"

15:58.558 --> 16:01.326
         (ALL BOOING)

16:01.795 --> 16:02.794
                Mom!

16:02.796 --> 16:03.594
                   Hey-ey.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.397
       You stole Christmas,
       and now the whole school
       blames us.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.667
 It was the worst day ever.
 People booed me.

16:09.669 --> 16:10.168
        Me!

16:10.170 --> 16:12.403
 Thank God I'm getting
 a surprise award show,

16:12.405 --> 16:13.972
 otherwise
 I'd be devastated.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.673
      Honey, there's not
      gonna be a...

16:15.675 --> 16:18.109
          Don't. Just don't.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.878
       Look, Erica, I'm sorry.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.147
       I did not mean
       to ruin the concert.

16:23.149 --> 16:23.681
               Well, you did.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.818
  I'm sorry, Pops,
  but I'm not singing your song
  this year.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.485
      What are you
      talking about?

16:27.487 --> 16:30.355
      Don't do this, Erica.
      Do not upset
      this lovely old man.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.291
      Ba-bap. I'm talking about
      the "Dreidel" song, Pops.

16:33.293 --> 16:33.758
            It's not happening.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.528
  Okay, I'm dealing
  with an Adam crisis here,
  so is this necessary?

16:37.530 --> 16:39.864
      The sweet man's busy.
      Leave him be.

16:39.866 --> 16:40.498
            Ba-da-bup!

16:40.500 --> 16:41.899
     Mom made me sing that song
     for you

16:41.901 --> 16:43.634
      ever since
      I was in the third grade.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.603
 Oh, I see
 what's going on.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.506
 Your mother's lied to you
 for a decade.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.208
 Have fun with that.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.010
           You're unbelievable.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.479
     Okay, okay.
     Here's the thing.

16:54.481 --> 16:58.182
 I might have
 slightly used Pops

16:58.184 --> 17:00.018
 to guilt you
 into singing for me.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.386
              Well, did it ever
              occur to you

17:01.388 --> 17:03.121
          to just ask me
          like a normal person?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.057
 Please!
 I gave up on that years ago.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.292
 Look, when you were
 a little girl,

17:09.295 --> 17:11.729
 every day,
 you used to dress up

17:11.731 --> 17:13.431
 and put on shows for me.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.665
 (SIGHS) It was everything.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.002
              I remember that.

17:18.003 --> 17:19.871
 Well, those days
 are gone.

17:19.873 --> 17:25.042
 Now it's a "no"
 anytime I ask anything of you.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.011
 So, I tricked you.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.781
 I just love hearing
 my little girl sing.

17:29.783 --> 17:33.151
         I actually
         understand your point.

17:33.153 --> 17:33.818
        Good.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.320
   'Cause I'm done
   trying to trick you.

17:36.322 --> 17:39.357
 If you don't want to sing,
 you don't have to.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.160
        I know I don't have to,

17:42.162 --> 17:45.463
        but now
        that you finally asked,

17:45.465 --> 17:46.464
             I kind of want to.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.699
    ADULT ADAM: <i> That night,</i>
   <i> my sister gave my mom</i>

17:48.701 --> 17:50.835

     <i> she'd always wanted.</i>

17:50.837 --> 17:53.137

18:26.206 --> 18:27.939

18:27.941 --> 18:28.706

18:28.708 --> 18:30.074
  Thought you might
  want this back.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.244
    <i> Holiday Special?</i>
     Did you actually watch it?

18:33.246 --> 18:34.278
 Yep, and guess what?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.014
 I think you missed something
 pretty big.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.683
 This guy. Know him?

18:38.685 --> 18:40.151
          Of course. Boba Fett.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.018
    He's my favorite character.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.155
 Got to admit,
 he was pretty cool in this.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.190
               Wait a second.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.960
       This was made way before
      <i> Empire Strikes Back,</i>

18:48.962 --> 18:50.061
      so if you think about it,

18:50.063 --> 18:52.563
          the <i> Holiday Special</i>
          gave us the Fett.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.665
 All I know is
 with the right point of view,

18:54.667 --> 18:58.603
 this special really is...
 pretty damn special.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.471
  <i> � Just wait, oh, oh, oh �</i>

19:00.473 --> 19:01.672
                    Pops.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.409
                    Um...

19:06.880 --> 19:08.513
               I don't get it.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.382
    How do you manage to always
    see the good in everything?

19:11.384 --> 19:14.685
 It's easy if you never
 lose your childlike wonder.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.455
  It doesn't matter
  how old you are.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.358
   People like us
   always have it.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.459
                   Really?

19:21.461 --> 19:22.593
       Really.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.329
 I need you to promise me
 one thing.

19:25.331 --> 19:30.101
 Always hold on to that wonder,
 no matter what.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.503
                I will, Pops.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.071
                 I love you.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.039
            I know.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.141
      <i> � Put a little love</i>
      <i> in your heart �</i>

19:37.143 --> 19:38.776
   ADULT ADAM: <i> And with that,</i>
  <i> Pops reminded me</i>

19:38.778 --> 19:40.845
      <i> that if you truly</i>
      <i> love something,</i>

19:40.847 --> 19:43.247
  <i> you never grow out of it.</i>

19:44.284 --> 19:45.750
      <i> That's the thing</i>
      <i> about the holidays.</i>

19:45.752 --> 19:47.185
   <i> Even the biggest Scrooge</i>

19:47.187 --> 19:51.088
    <i> might be moved</i>
    <i> by a sense of wonder.</i>

19:51.090 --> 19:53.925
           You...replaced
           my favorite posters.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.560
   I guess
   it's a holiday miracle.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.329
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> Once I saw the good</i>
  <i> in the</i> Star Wars <i> special,</i>

19:58.331 --> 19:59.964
   <i> I began to see the good</i>
   <i> in everything.</i>

19:59.966 --> 20:02.166
  <i> And so I went back</i>
  <i> to finish</i> Howard the Duck.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.702
   <i> Turns out he became</i>
   <i> a legendary cult badass.</i>

20:04.704 --> 20:06.971
   Aren't you glad we came back
   and saw the end?

20:06.973 --> 20:09.640
 Oh, yeah.
 I wish I was
 half as cool as Howard.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.910
             He does have a way
             with the ladies.

20:12.912 --> 20:13.511
         (BOTH LAUGH)

20:13.513 --> 20:15.479
  <i> � There's got to be</i>
  <i> a better way</i>

         That's my baby!

20:18.051 --> 20:18.816
       (LAUGHS) That's my baby.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.218
<i> � Don't you think</i>
<i> it's time for a start?</i>

20:20.220 --> 20:24.488
     <i> � Put a little love</i>
     <i> in your heart �</i>

20:28.294 --> 20:30.228
     (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

20:30.230 --> 20:32.296
           I had to lie
           to make this happen,

20:32.298 --> 20:34.298
   but it was totally worth it.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.668

20:58.057 --> 21:00.424
   BARRY: <i> � He once choked out</i>
  <i> a Tyrannosaurus</i>

21:00.426 --> 21:03.094
    <i> � He's looks just like</i>
    <i> a Hebrew Chuck Norris</i>

21:03.096 --> 21:05.463

     <i> his name is Judah</i>

21:05.465 --> 21:07.832
