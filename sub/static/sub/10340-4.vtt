WEBVTT

02:18.638 --> 02:20.514
Diane, 7:15 a.m.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.933
I'll be heading to the sheriff's
after breakfast.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.770
From there, we'll be going on
to Laura Palmer's funeral.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.203
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.124
Just "agent," Audrey. Special agent.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.127
Special agent.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.462
Would you care to join me
for breakfast?

02:54.716 --> 02:58.093
- I'm in a hurry.
- For what?

02:59.095 --> 03:02.848
Audrey, that perfume you're wearing
is incredible.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.602
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, I do.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.812
Please have a seat.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.983
And would you write your name
down for me? Here.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.360
Okay.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.955
There's something
you'd like to tell me.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.375
There is?

03:30.835 --> 03:35.130
You slipped this note
underneath my door night before last.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.340
I did?

03:41.346 --> 03:43.847
I wanted to help you. For Laura.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.142
You said you and Laura
weren't exactly friends.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.811
We weren't friends, but I understood
her better than the rest.

03:51.064 --> 03:55.150
- What is One-Eyed Jack's?
- It's a place up north.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.360
Men go there.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.111
What about women?

04:01.032 --> 04:04.785
Women, you know, work there.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.204
Did Laura work there?

04:08.164 --> 04:10.415
I don't know.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.709
Laura worked
at my father's department store.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.837
- Horne's.
- He named it after himself.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.839
Where
at Horne's Department Store?

04:20.385 --> 04:21.677
At the perfume counter.

04:23.554 --> 04:26.348
- So did Ronette Pulaski.
- Really?

04:27.350 --> 04:29.309
Audrey, that rightward slant
in your handwriting

04:29.477 --> 04:31.979
indicates a romantic nature.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.898
A heart that yearns. Be careful.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.484
I do?

04:44.409 --> 04:46.785
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.329
Police business.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.626
Thank you for talking to me.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.052
- Trudy, two more coffees, please.
- Mm.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.471
Harry, Lucy.

05:06.639 --> 05:10.350
It is an absolutely beautiful morning.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.185
Short stack of griddlecakes,
melted butter,

05:12.353 --> 05:14.104
maple syrup, lightly heated,
slice of ham.

05:14.272 --> 05:18.442
Nothing beats the taste sensation
when maple syrup collides with ham.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.153
Griddlecakes, slice of ham.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.238
Who killed Laura Palmer?

05:25.616 --> 05:26.992
Ahh.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.037
Let me tell you
about the dream I had last night.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.248
- Tibet?
- No.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.958
You were there. Lucy, so were you.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.963
Harry, my dream is a code
waiting to be broken.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.715
Break the code, solve the crime.

05:42.967 --> 05:48.138
"Break the code, solve the crime."

05:48.306 --> 05:51.641
In my dream, Sarah Palmer
has a vision of her daughter's killer.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.769
Deputy Hawk sketched his picture.

05:53.936 --> 05:57.064
I got a phone call
from a one-armed man named Mike.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.648
The killer's name was Bob.

05:58.816 --> 05:59.983
Mike and Bobby?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.402
No. It's a different Mike
and a different Bob.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.155
They lived
above a convenience store.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.990
They had a tattoo:

06:07.158 --> 06:11.036
Fire, walk with me.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.331
Mike couldn't stand the killing
anymore, so he cut off his arm.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.042
Bob vowed to kill again,
so Mike shot him.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.795
Do you know
where dreams come from?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.131
- Not specifically.
- No.

06:23.674 --> 06:27.010
Acetylcholine neurons
fire high-voltage impulses

06:27.178 --> 06:28.470
into the forebrain.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.765
These impulses become pictures,
the pictures become dreams.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.769
But no one knows why we choose
these particular pictures.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.021
So, what was the end of this dream?

06:39.023 --> 06:40.982
Suddenly, it was 25 years later.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.151
I was old, sitting in a red room.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.779
There was a midget
in a red suit and a beautiful woman.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.865
The little man told me that my favorite
gum was coming back into style

06:49.033 --> 06:52.702
and didn't his cousin look exactly
like Laura Palmer? Which she did.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.330
- What cousin?
- The beautiful woman.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.958
She's filled with secrets.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.293
Sometimes her arms bend back.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.587
Where she's from,
the birds sing a pretty song

07:02.755 --> 07:05.048
and there's always music in the air.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.383
The midget did a dance.

07:06.551 --> 07:10.554
Laura kissed me and she whispered
the name of the killer in my ear.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.180
Who was it?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.016
I don't remember.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.603
- Damn.
- Damn.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.731
Harry, our job is simple.
Break the code, solve the crime.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.110
Yeah?

07:25.278 --> 07:28.071
Sheriff, I'm at the morgue
and there's a big fight going on.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.407
You hang on. I'll be right there.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.660
That was Andy.
There's a fight over at the morgue.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.246
Albert.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.582
You're the most cold-blooded
man I've ever seen.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.293
I've never met a man
with so little regard for human frailty.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.586
Have you no compassion?

07:42.753 --> 07:44.921
I've got compassion
running out of my nose, pal.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.090
I'm the sultan of sentiment.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.426
Dr. Hayward,
I have traveled thousands of miles

07:49.594 --> 07:52.179
and apparently several centuries
to this forgotten sinkhole

07:52.346 --> 07:54.055
in order to perform a series of tests.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.974
I do not ask you
to understand these tests.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.184
I'm not a cruel man.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.144
I just ask you
to get the hell out of my way

07:59.312 --> 08:00.604
so I can finish. Is that clear?

08:00.771 --> 08:03.315
We are here to conduct
Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.526
If you think we're gonna leave here
without her, you are out of your mind.

08:06.694 --> 08:10.363
All right, all right, all right.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.616
Mr. Rosenfield, please.

08:16.412 --> 08:20.999
Now, uh, Leland Palmer
couldn't be with us today,

08:21.167 --> 08:23.210
but I know I speak for everyone,

08:23.377 --> 08:24.628
the Palmer family included,

08:24.795 --> 08:30.759
when I say that, uh, we appreciate
and understand the value of your work.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.386
But as their representative,

08:33.554 --> 08:37.724
I must insist
that we consider the feelings

08:37.892 --> 08:40.310
of the Palmer family as well.

08:40.478 --> 08:44.231
Mr. Horne, I realize that your position
in this fair community

08:44.398 --> 08:47.484
pretty well guarantees venality,
insincerity,

08:47.652 --> 08:50.278
and a rather irritating method
of expressing yourself.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.865
Stupidity, however,
is not a necessarily inherent trait.

08:54.033 --> 08:58.745
Therefore, please listen closely.
You can have a funeral any old time.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.664
You dig a hole, you plant a coffin.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.000
I, however,
cannot perform these tests next year,

09:04.502 --> 09:06.127
next month, next week or tomorrow.

09:06.295 --> 09:08.588
I must perform them now.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.675
I've got a lot of cutting
and pasting to do,

09:11.842 --> 09:14.469
so why don't you return to your porch
rockers and resume whittling?

09:16.138 --> 09:17.931
That does it.
I'm taking charge of the body.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.724
You don't touch Laura
from this moment on.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.560
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

09:21.727 --> 09:23.061
- Gentlemen.
- Whoa!

09:23.229 --> 09:26.398
- What's going on?
- Thank God.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.527
Cooper, this old fool is obstructing
a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.488
He won't release Laura's body
for the funeral. He's not human.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.032
- What's the holdup?
- Please, Cooper.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.536
I do not suffer fools gladly
and fools with badges, never.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.997
I want no interference
from this hulking boob. That clear?

09:43.374 --> 09:45.625
I've had just about enough
of your insults.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.669
Oh, yeah?

09:47.837 --> 09:51.172
Well, I've had about enough of,
uh, morons and half-wits,

09:51.340 --> 09:54.134
dolts, dunces, dullards
and dumbbells.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.886
And you, chowderhead yokel,
you blithering hayseed,

09:57.054 --> 09:58.555
you've had enough of me?

09:59.557 --> 10:02.017
Yes, I have.

10:05.730 --> 10:09.232
Ugh. Oh, that's nice.
How appropriate.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.069
Wait in the car, Harry.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.036
The old rustic sucker punch, huh?

10:21.203 --> 10:23.663
- A hail of bullets would be nice.
- That's enough.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.082
The sheriff didn't mean anything.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.836
- He hit me.
- Well, I'm sure he meant to do that.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.173
Albert, I want you to release this
girl's body to her family immediately.

10:33.341 --> 10:37.677
I want your test results by noon.
Those are orders.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.103
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.715
Invitation to Love.

11:15.883 --> 11:20.303
Starring Martin Hadley as Chet,

11:21.555 --> 11:26.518
Selena Swift as Emerald and Jade,

11:27.228 --> 11:30.105
Evan St. Vincent
as Jared Lancaster

11:32.024 --> 11:36.778
and Jason Dembo as Montana.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.325
My darling daughter, Jade,

11:42.785 --> 11:44.327
and Emerald,

11:44.495 --> 11:49.499
because of my financial difficulties,
I have decided to end it all tonight.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.001
I hope you can find the strength
to go on without me.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.170
Your loving father, Jared.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.924
- Uncle Leland?
- Daddy, it's Jade.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.844
- Uncle Leland.
- Please. I know you're in there.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.598
Madeleine?

12:07.977 --> 12:11.813
Jade, what a surprise, I...

12:19.196 --> 12:21.197
Maddy?

12:21.365 --> 12:23.158
Is it you?

12:25.369 --> 12:27.704
Uncle Leland,

12:28.664 --> 12:31.833
I am so sorry.

12:49.894 --> 12:54.689
I'm sure Hank appreciates
your unwavering devotion.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.858
Your husband
has been a model prisoner,

12:57.026 --> 13:00.236
an inspiration to guard
and inmate alike.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.988
He greets the day with a smile

13:02.156 --> 13:04.991
and confounds adversity
with a kind word.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.411
Hank's parole hearing
is scheduled for tomorrow.

13:08.871 --> 13:14.209
Barring unforeseen circumstance,
with your full support before the board,

13:14.376 --> 13:17.337
he could be released
shortly thereafter.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.380
Any questions?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.425
No.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.094
Will you help find the job
that Hank needs

13:25.262 --> 13:28.181
to effect a successful parole?

13:28.682 --> 13:31.726
- Yes.
- How exactly?

13:32.937 --> 13:35.063
I own the Double R, Mr. Mooney.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.439
Oh.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.108
You're quite a girl, Norma.

13:39.485 --> 13:44.113
I'll bet you get all kinds of Romeos
in here, uh, begging for favors.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.949
How do you keep them
from your door?

13:46.367 --> 13:49.536
I usually tell them
I have a homicidally jealous husband

13:49.703 --> 13:52.038
who's doing three-to-five
for manslaughter,

13:52.998 --> 13:56.751
but he expects to be a productive
member of society real soon.

13:57.253 --> 14:01.381
Well, now, that should conclude
our session for today, Mrs. Jennings.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.511
Look at that.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.721
Ducks on the lake.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.433
So fill me in on Leo Johnson.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.270
Leo's one of those guys you keep
on a list and you keep your eye on.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.481
So far, we haven't caught him
with his paws in the cookie jar.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.111
Morning, Leo.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.822
Who the hell is he?

14:25.990 --> 14:29.158
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.953
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.414
So ask.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.584
Leo, is that short for Leonard?

14:38.168 --> 14:40.086
That's a question?

14:42.006 --> 14:44.924
- Did you know Laura Palmer?
- No.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.343
- How well did you know her?
- I said I didn't.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.179
You're lying.

14:50.848 --> 14:54.142
I knew who she was, all right?
Everybody did.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.439
- Do you have a criminal record, Leo?
- Nothing. You can look it up.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.357
Illegal U-turn, April 1986.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.192
Drunk and disorderly,
November 1987.

15:03.360 --> 15:07.614
September '88,
aggravated assault, charges dropped.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.867
I paid my debt to society.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.494
Where were you the night
of Laura Palmer's murder?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.788
- Around midnight.
- On the road.

15:15.956 --> 15:19.375
I called my wife, Shelly,
around that time from Butte, Montana.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.837
- She'll confirm this?
- She will if you ask her.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.022
Robbie.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.400
This may be a good time
for a brief discussion.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.239
You wanna talk about cigarettes?
Today?

15:51.575 --> 15:52.909
No, but put it out.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.912
It's a filthy habit,
especially for a varsity athlete.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.095
Yeah,
I've attended my share of funerals.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.138
Too many.

16:14.473 --> 16:18.518
Any time a man dies in war,
he dies too soon.

16:19.436 --> 16:22.605
Laura died too soon as well.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.692
Yeah, she did.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.987
But we have a responsibility
to the dead, Robert.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.281
Responsibility
is the linchpin of our society.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.367
Each man responsible
for his own actions,

16:34.535 --> 16:38.454
each action contributing
to the greater good.

16:38.622 --> 16:43.835
What's the good
of putting someone in the ground?

16:44.003 --> 16:47.338
Well, it's man's way
of achieving closure.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.716
In ceremony begins understanding,

16:49.883 --> 16:53.594
and the will to carry on
without those we must leave behind.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.179
Robert, in your life you must learn,

16:55.347 --> 16:58.474
you will learn,
to carry on without them.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.935
Great.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.982
Now, I realize you experience
an ongoing disinclination

17:06.150 --> 17:09.360
to enter fully
into meaningful exchange.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.904
This leads to stalemate

17:12.072 --> 17:16.325
and a desire on my part
to force certain wisdom upon you.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.369
This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.581
Sometimes
it's the best course available.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.085
Son, don't be afraid.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.963
We'll all be there together.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.175
Afraid of what?

17:32.342 --> 17:34.469
Well, the funeral.

17:35.679 --> 17:39.015
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.350
Afraid?

17:43.687 --> 17:46.189
I can hardly wait.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.858
Afraid?

17:49.026 --> 17:52.945
I'm gonna turn it upside down!

17:53.113 --> 17:55.114
Everybody ready?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.541
Deputy Hawk.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.920
Agent Cooper, there's no sign
of the man with one arm.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.839
Keep trying.
He's out there somewhere.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.592
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.177
- He's a tracker?
- The best.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.762
Oh.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.140
Okay, Albert, what do you got?

18:21.308 --> 18:23.434
Enough forensic spadework
to save your butt

18:23.602 --> 18:26.062
and get mine out
of this godforsaken burg.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.357
What do you got?

18:31.401 --> 18:36.239
Okay, first of all, contents of envelope
found in Palmer diary, cocaine.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.241
Toxicology results also positive.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.327
Newsflash: the little lady had a habit.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.745
Next, we've got fibers of twine

18:42.913 --> 18:44.622
embedded in her wrists
and upper arms.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.250
Two different kinds of twine.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.794
Fibers of twine
found in the railroad car.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.337
Matched the sample from her wrist.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.965
The same twine was used to bind
the wrists of the Pulaski girl.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.509
Conclusion: she was tied up twice

18:56.677 --> 18:58.594
at different locations
on the night of her death.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.763
Once here and once here.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.223
Like this:

19:02.933 --> 19:06.227
Sometimes my arms bend back.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.896
Here we've got traces of pumice found
in standing water

19:09.064 --> 19:10.273
outside the railroad car.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.233
Soap, industrial strength.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.569
I found identical particles
on the back of Laura's neck.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.612
It's not her home-use brand.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.364
My conclusion,

19:18.532 --> 19:22.410
the killer washed his hands
and then leaned in for a kiss.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.911
Like this:

19:24.997 --> 19:27.456
Good Lord.

19:28.792 --> 19:32.003
Uh, distinctive wounds found
on Laura's neck and shoulder

19:32.171 --> 19:35.965
appear to be claw marks,
bites of some kind.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.092
An animal.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.804
Look, it's trying to think.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.311
Finally, a small plastic fragment
from her stomach

19:48.478 --> 19:51.189
partially dissolved by digestive acids.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.982
I'm taking it back for reconstruction,

19:53.150 --> 19:56.319
as the local facilities give new meaning
to the word "primitive."

19:56.486 --> 19:59.906
I note with some interest
what appears to be the letter J.

20:01.950 --> 20:02.992
Good work, Albert.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.828
A couple more days with the body,
who knows what I might have found?

20:05.996 --> 20:08.164
Sheriff, it's time.

20:10.209 --> 20:15.087
Excuse us.
We have got a funeral to get to.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.511
Cooper,
may I have a word with you alone?

20:25.724 --> 20:28.643
There's one more item. It's a report
concerning the assault on my person

20:28.810 --> 20:29.894
which you witnessed.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.981
I think you'll find it's quite accurate.
Requires your signature.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.985
Albert, I'm not gonna sign this.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.946
What?

20:40.614 --> 20:43.032
Albert, I hope you can hear me.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.993
I have only been in Twin Peaks
a short time,

20:46.161 --> 20:50.289
but in that time, I have seen decency,
honor and dignity.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.958
Murder is not a faceless event here.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.586
It is not a statistic to be tallied up
at the end of the day.

20:55.754 --> 20:59.340
Laura Palmer's death has affected
each and every man, woman and child

20:59.508 --> 21:01.884
because life has meaning here.
Every life.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.886
That's a way of living
I thought had vanished.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.556
But it hasn't, Albert.
It's right here in Twin Peaks.

21:09.017 --> 21:12.520
Sounds like you've been snacking
on some of the local mushrooms.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.897
With your behavior
towards these good people,

21:15.065 --> 21:17.566
consider yourself lucky
I do not file a report of my own

21:17.734 --> 21:22.071
that could bury you in a building
so deep you'd never see the sun.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.419
Diane, it's 12:27 p.m.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.713
I'd like you to look
into my pension-plan options

21:38.880 --> 21:41.841
regarding
outside real-estate investment.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.592
I may look into purchasing property

21:43.760 --> 21:48.014
at what I assume
will be a very reasonable price.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.042
Mm. Mm!

22:19.129 --> 22:21.255
Love me?

22:21.423 --> 22:23.466
You bet.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.470
This a new one?

22:28.472 --> 22:30.681
Yes.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.642
Isn't it beautiful?

22:35.812 --> 22:37.355
Oh.

22:38.065 --> 22:40.232
How do I look?

22:42.944 --> 22:44.612
Well, you look fine, Nadine.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.782
Oh, Ed.

22:47.949 --> 22:51.410
Last night was wonderful.

22:52.162 --> 22:57.083
Oh, my darling Ed,
you came back to me.

22:57.793 --> 23:02.004
Now I feel
like we're really together again.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.725
Ed, in high school,

23:15.685 --> 23:22.358
I used to watch Norma and you
at those football games.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.611
She was so pretty.

23:25.904 --> 23:29.824
And you made
such a handsome couple.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.118
But I knew,

23:33.537 --> 23:38.374
even though I was just

23:39.126 --> 23:42.002
a little nobody,

23:42.879 --> 23:48.175
just a little brown mouse,

23:51.555 --> 23:55.307
I always knew inside,

23:56.309 --> 23:59.437
once you got to know me,

24:00.897 --> 24:03.107
we'd be together forever.

24:07.237 --> 24:11.198
That's not your bike, is it, Ed?

24:11.366 --> 24:13.576
It's James.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.746
James who?

24:19.749 --> 24:21.125
Oh.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.761
We don't wanna be late.
Are you ready?

24:33.388 --> 24:35.055
I'm not going.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.850
It's Laura, James.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.768
I can't.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.937
I just can't.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.147
James.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.196
I don't care what the doctor says.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.240
If you keep indulging him this way,
he is never going to change.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.367
I don't think we should be
discussing this

24:55.535 --> 24:56.827
while Johnny's in the room.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.996
Johnny doesn't
even know what day it is.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.332
- We have to be patient.
- You be patient.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.961
I have been waiting 20 years
for some sign of intelligent life.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.595
I'm clear about this, Sylvia.
I have my limits.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.138
Don't I know it.

25:16.306 --> 25:19.141
My, let's all spray venom
in my general direction.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.477
You take it with no problem.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.646
Taking it is the specialty of the house.

25:23.813 --> 25:27.566
Sylvia, I'm going to make it
extremely simple for you.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.611
We can't take Johnny
to the funeral in that ridiculous getup.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.613
Let Dr. Jacoby see what he can do.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.323
We gotta go.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.574
No, no.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.785
You do it, then.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.870
Am I going to have to call Dr. Jacoby

25:40.038 --> 25:44.083
every damn time
I have a problem with Johnny?

25:56.346 --> 25:58.013
Oh, thank God.

25:58.181 --> 26:01.642
All right,
let's everyone just get into the car.

26:18.326 --> 26:21.453
I am the resurrection and the life.

26:21.621 --> 26:27.084
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

26:27.252 --> 26:32.506
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die.

26:32.674 --> 26:38.137
For none of us liveth to himself,
and no man dieth to himself.

26:38.305 --> 26:41.682
For if we live, we live unto the Lord.

26:42.058 --> 26:45.644
And if we die, we die unto the Lord.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.480
Whether we live, therefore,
or we die,

26:48.648 --> 26:51.233
we are the Lord's.

26:51.568 --> 26:55.070
Blessed be the dead
who die in the Lord,

26:55.238 --> 27:00.743
even so sayeth the Spirit,
for they rest from their labors.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.078
The Lord be with thee.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.582
Let us pray.

27:08.001 --> 27:13.589
O God, entrust this child, Laura,
to thy never-failing care and love,

27:13.757 --> 27:16.425
and bring us all
to thy heavenly kingdom,

27:16.593 --> 27:19.845
through the same,
thy son, Jesus Christ our Lord,

27:20.013 --> 27:24.099
who liveth and reigneth with thee
and the Holy Spirit.

27:24.267 --> 27:29.229
One God, now and forever. Amen.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.691
I baptized Laura Palmer.

27:33.234 --> 27:35.736
I instructed her in Sunday school.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.074
And I, like the rest of you,
came to love her

27:40.241 --> 27:47.122
with that special love that we reserve
for the headstrong and the bold.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.542
Laura was bright.

27:52.128 --> 27:56.465
She was beautiful,
she was charming.

27:56.633 --> 28:01.887
But most of all,
Laura was, I think, impatient.

28:02.055 --> 28:05.140
She was impatient
for her life to begin,

28:05.308 --> 28:10.312
for the world to finally catch up
to her dreams and ambitions.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.981
Laura used to say
that I talked too much.

28:13.149 --> 28:16.193
I'll not make that mistake today.

28:16.361 --> 28:20.322
Just let it be said that I loved her,

28:20.490 --> 28:23.659
and I will miss her
the rest of my days.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.285
Amen.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.123
Amen.

28:32.335 --> 28:33.669
Thank you, Johnny.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.755
Amen!

28:43.638 --> 28:45.806
What are you looking at?

28:47.851 --> 28:49.476
What are you waiting for?

28:50.895 --> 28:51.937
You make me sick.

28:53.356 --> 28:56.775
You damn hypocrites make me sick!

28:57.861 --> 29:01.196
Everybody knew she was in trouble.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.866
But we didn't do anything.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.911
All you good people.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.123
You wanna know who killed Laura?

29:11.291 --> 29:13.459
You did!

29:14.753 --> 29:16.795
We all did.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.384
And pretty words aren't gonna bring
her back, man, so save your prayers.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.470
She would've laughed
at them anyway.

29:32.687 --> 29:36.565
You are dead, man. You're dead.

29:40.111 --> 29:43.030
That's enough, Bobby.
That's enough.

29:46.701 --> 29:50.537
You're dead!

29:51.581 --> 29:52.915
Get off me.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.834
You're a dead man. Dead.

29:57.921 --> 30:01.006
You're dead, man. Gah! Dead.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.425
That's enough. Come on.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.427
Get off me.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.221
Agh!

30:09.224 --> 30:11.892
My baby. Laura.

30:14.312 --> 30:17.147
Laura, no.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.982
- Hang on.
- Can you reach him?

30:19.150 --> 30:21.527
No...

30:22.570 --> 30:24.112
The whole thing has gone haywire.

30:29.202 --> 30:32.287
Don't ruin this too.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.920
My baby.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.129
Laura.

30:47.303 --> 30:50.138
Laura.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.992
So here's the guy, right.
He was the father.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.661
And this is his daughter in the coffin.
He goes, boom!

31:23.381 --> 31:26.842
I'm telling you, Harry,
he's just not gonna figure this out.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.679
Ed, that's a bet I'll take
for the check.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.890
He's right on time.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.350
Harry, careful who you trust.
He's just not one of us.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.519
Cooper, take a seat.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.940
Harry, I got your note. Hawk, Big Ed.

31:42.108 --> 31:46.278
How would you like
some fresh huckleberry pie?

31:47.572 --> 31:48.697
I would love a slice of pie.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.366
Norma, slice of huckleberry pie,
heated,

31:51.534 --> 31:53.118
vanilla ice cream on the side, coffee.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.495
Coming right up.

31:57.999 --> 32:01.043
Big Ed, how long you been in love
with Norma?

32:06.299 --> 32:09.343
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's
on you.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.764
Okay, what did you call me in
to talk about

32:13.932 --> 32:16.099
besides the highlights
of the dinner menu?

32:16.267 --> 32:17.392
You better tell him.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.647
Somebody's running drugs into
Twin Peaks from across the border.

32:21.814 --> 32:24.149
We've been working this
for months, trying to set up a bust.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.361
- Top to bottom. Nobody walks.
- Who's targeted?

32:27.528 --> 32:29.363
Jacques Renault,
bartender at the Roadhouse.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.157
We figure him for the middleman.

32:32.408 --> 32:33.867
Now, Ed's been doing
some undercover.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.037
In fact, the night you got into town,
he was staking Renault out.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.164
We think Renault
slipped him a mickey.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.500
Felt like somebody hit me
with a log splitter.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.085
Ed, I didn't know you were a deputy.

32:43.878 --> 32:44.920
He's not.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.882
Well, it's a little outside
your jurisdiction, don't you think?

32:49.050 --> 32:51.635
Somebody's selling drugs
to high school kids,

32:51.803 --> 32:53.762
and I figure
that's everybody's jurisdiction.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.765
I call Ed in when I need him.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.100
He's not the only one I call.

33:03.481 --> 33:06.108
- Thanks, Norma.
- Enjoy.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.987
Mm.

33:10.697 --> 33:14.449
This must be where pies go
when they die.

33:16.828 --> 33:21.623
Okay, Harry, would you please tell me
why you really called me in here?

33:21.791 --> 33:23.542
You're gonna have to go
along with me on this

33:23.710 --> 33:25.293
even if it sounds a little weird.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.255
- I'm with you.
- Twin Peaks is different.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.465
A long way from the world.
You've noticed that.

33:30.633 --> 33:32.509
Yes, I have.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.511
And that's exactly the way we like it.

33:34.679 --> 33:40.142
But there's a back end to that
that's kind of different too.

33:40.309 --> 33:42.644
Maybe that's the price we pay
for all the good things.

33:43.229 --> 33:47.149
- What would that be?
- There's a sort of evil out there.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.362
Something very, very strange
in these old woods.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.573
Call it what you want:

33:54.741 --> 33:57.075
a darkness, a presence.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.869
It takes many forms,

33:59.037 --> 34:03.290
but it's been out there
for as long as anyone can remember.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.625
And we've always been here
to fight it.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.502
We?

34:07.670 --> 34:10.005
Men before us.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.591
Men before them.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.676
More after we're gone.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.179
A secret society.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.349
Why don't we take Agent Cooper
for a little ride?

34:22.185 --> 34:24.019
- Where to?
- The Bookhouse.

34:36.115 --> 34:38.658
This is where we get together.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.536
Going on 20 years now.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.830
"We" meaning?

34:44.457 --> 34:46.708
The Bookhouse Boys.

34:46.876 --> 34:50.170
- Coffee's free.
- Like the sound of that.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.009
Cooper, you know James.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.179
- Agent Cooper.
- James.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.307
- This is Joey Paulson.
- Joey.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.600
Who's this?

35:03.768 --> 35:05.811
Bernard Renault, Jacques' brother.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.647
Janitor at the Roadhouse.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.565
Bernard came across the border
this morning

35:10.733 --> 35:13.819
with an ounce of cocaine
in his kit bag.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.738
Thought we'd ask him
a few questions.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.661
Did you ever sell drugs
to Laura Palmer?

35:23.621 --> 35:25.080
I don't sell drugs.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.499
How much does Jacques pay you
to be the mule?

35:27.667 --> 35:31.086
Jacques don't pay me nothing.
I'm no mule.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.755
So that ounce you had,
that was for personal use?

35:34.173 --> 35:35.215
That's right.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.093
Guess you don't get a whole lot
of sleep at night, then, huh, Bernie?

35:38.261 --> 35:41.179
Your brother didn't come into work
the last few days. Where's he been?

35:41.639 --> 35:43.098
I don't know.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.766
He got personal business.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.101
Who else is he dealing with?

35:46.269 --> 35:48.270
Why don't you ask him yourself?

35:48.437 --> 35:50.772
He be back tonight. Any minute.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.732
He's coming to work
at the Roadhouse?

35:53.067 --> 35:54.776
He the bartender, isn't he?

35:54.944 --> 35:58.238
Bernard,
we've got you tied up in a chair.

35:58.406 --> 36:02.450
You're mixed up with your brother
in a wide variety of felonies.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.953
What I wanna know is,
why in the world would you tell us

36:05.121 --> 36:07.038
where and when to find him?

36:42.158 --> 36:43.491
- Yeah?
- Leo.

36:43.659 --> 36:45.827
- It's Jacques.
- What's up?

36:45.995 --> 36:47.454
The light. The bust light's on.

36:47.788 --> 36:49.456
- Bernard's in trouble.
- You sure?

36:49.624 --> 36:50.916
I saw it, man.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.835
You gotta get me out of here, Leo.
Border run.

36:54.003 --> 36:57.505
- Where are you?
- Phone booth by the cash and carry.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.424
And I don't like waiting, man.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.677
Shut up. I'm on my way.

37:02.845 --> 37:04.596
Hi.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.937
- Where you going?
- You don't need to know.

37:50.476 --> 37:52.227
Josie.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.312
Josie, what's wrong?

37:55.064 --> 37:57.399
Nothing.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.861
- Nothing?
- Mm.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.370
God, you're beautiful.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.633
Josie, there is something wrong.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.176
What is it? I want you to tell me.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.808
Something horrible
is going to happen.

38:32.810 --> 38:36.396
- They wanna hurt me. I know it.
- Who?

38:36.814 --> 38:37.856
Who wants to hurt you?

38:39.066 --> 38:40.525
Catherine.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.402
Catherine and Benjamin Horne.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.782
What makes you think so?

38:47.950 --> 38:54.331
I heard Catherine
on the phone saying I'd never suspect.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.458
Just like with Andrew's death.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.752
Andrew's death was an accident.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.670
Was it?

39:00.838 --> 39:03.631
Catherine keeps
the mill account books in her safe.

39:03.799 --> 39:06.968
Two books. Different numbers.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.974
Andrew built this years ago.

39:14.602 --> 39:18.313
I don't think Catherine knows
that I know it's here.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.610
Why do you think
they have two sets of books?

39:24.570 --> 39:27.155
The usual reasons would have
something to do with stealing.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.324
Maybe worse.

39:34.705 --> 39:37.832
There were two. I saw them.

39:38.584 --> 39:40.168
You believe me, don't you?

39:40.336 --> 39:42.295
Of course I do.

39:43.339 --> 39:46.674
There's nothing unusual in this one.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.093
Oh, there were two.

39:48.260 --> 39:51.179
I swear, there were two.

40:05.986 --> 40:09.447
Have you seen my tackle box?

40:11.283 --> 40:14.702
The next time you and the merry
widow wanna take a peek in my safe,

40:14.870 --> 40:16.871
don't go to so much trouble.

40:17.289 --> 40:20.708
Be a man about it, Pete.
Ask me to my face.

40:24.964 --> 40:30.718
Maybe I'll, um, check the truck.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.504
Dr. Jacoby.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.425
I didn't see you at the funeral today.

41:12.636 --> 41:15.722
I'm a terrible person, Agent Cooper.

41:16.307 --> 41:20.268
I pretend that I'm not, but I am.

41:22.229 --> 41:26.107
Oh, I sit and listen to their problems,

41:26.275 --> 41:27.609
day after day.

41:29.111 --> 41:33.907
These people think of me
as their friend.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.704
The truth is, I really don't care.

41:41.916 --> 41:46.461
I thought nothing, no one,

41:46.629 --> 41:49.172
could ever reach me again.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.136
Laura changed all that.

42:00.392 --> 42:01.976
I couldn't come today.

42:04.146 --> 42:06.231
I just couldn't.

42:09.985 --> 42:12.487
I hope she understands.

42:15.032 --> 42:17.534
I hope she forgives me.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.205
You think it's possible?

42:22.998 --> 42:26.084
You think somebody killed Andrew?

42:28.629 --> 42:30.838
I don't know.

42:32.174 --> 42:38.513
I believe what they want
is to take the mill away from me.

42:39.181 --> 42:42.433
For Benjamin to have the land.

42:44.144 --> 42:48.356
If it was true with Andrew,

42:49.066 --> 42:51.693
you think they'll kill me too?

42:51.860 --> 42:53.861
Think they would?

42:56.699 --> 42:58.866
Josie,

42:59.535 --> 43:00.785
nothing is gonna happen to you.

43:00.953 --> 43:05.832
Not now, not ever.
Not while I'm around.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.422
Do you believe in the soul?

43:56.091 --> 43:57.592
Several.

43:58.427 --> 44:01.596
- More than one?
- Blackfoot legend.

44:01.764 --> 44:06.267
Waking souls that give life
to the mind and the body.

44:06.435 --> 44:08.645
A dream soul that wanders.

44:08.812 --> 44:11.105
Dream souls.

44:11.273 --> 44:15.485
- Where do they wander?
- Faraway places.

44:15.903 --> 44:18.279
The Land of the Dead.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.366
Is that where Laura is?

44:21.533 --> 44:23.284
Laura's in the ground, Agent Cooper.

44:23.452 --> 44:26.204
That's the only thing I'm sure of.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.427
To Laura.

44:44.014 --> 44:46.474
Godspeed.

44:53.399 --> 44:55.525
- Will you dance with me?
- No.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.403
- Sorry, pal.
- Please.

44:58.570 --> 44:59.779
- Dance with me?
- No.

45:00.197 --> 45:02.198
- Please.
- That's kind of rude, mister.

45:02.366 --> 45:04.992
- Dance with me.
- Come on, leave us alone.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.869
Dance with me, please?

45:07.037 --> 45:10.915
Please.

45:11.667 --> 45:14.752
Somebody dance with me.

45:20.467 --> 45:23.886
Mr. Palmer? Leland.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.857
Let's take you home.

45:36.024 --> 46:57.104
Home.
