00:33.634 --> 00:34.800
Help me.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.503
Let me out.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.432
Sir...

01:08.435 --> 01:10.302
please let me go.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.838
You don't have to do this.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.741
I won't tell anybody. Just...

01:19.412 --> 01:21.480
No. Let me out!

01:21.482 --> 01:23.348
Let me go!

01:23.350 --> 01:24.817
Let me out.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.654
Let me out!

01:31.692 --> 01:33.058
No!

01:34.862 --> 01:36.295
Our top story tonight,

01:36.297 --> 01:37.996
Chicago police
continue to search

01:37.998 --> 01:39.331
for a missing schoolteacher.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.868
Debra Ann Skokie,
last seen on Tuesday leaving...

01:46.940 --> 01:49.508
A police department spokeswoman

01:49.510 --> 01:52.177
announced the formation
of a special unit task force

01:52.179 --> 01:54.012
in conjunction with the FBI

01:54.014 --> 01:56.214
to investigate
the recent disappearances of...

01:58.218 --> 02:01.153
I'm standing outside
the Chicago Police Department,

02:01.155 --> 02:03.188
where, moments ago,
detectives announced

02:03.190 --> 02:06.058
they've taken Francis
Allen Visser into custody.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.060
Visser has been
a person of interest

02:08.062 --> 02:11.062
in the murder of
Irene Burge and Katie Pallick.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.631
The bodies were found...

02:26.412 --> 02:28.914
In a shocking development today

02:28.916 --> 02:30.149
Francis Allen Visser,

02:30.151 --> 02:32.050
a suspect in the terrifying
burial murders

02:32.052 --> 02:34.286
of several young women
in the Chicago area,

02:34.288 --> 02:36.688
was released
from custody this morning.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.123
There is speculation

02:38.125 --> 02:40.392
that lead investigator
Detective Thomas McCormack

02:40.394 --> 02:42.628
may be facing
disciplinary action

02:42.630 --> 02:43.662
for the possible tampering

02:43.664 --> 02:45.824
of evidence found
at the scene of the crime.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.233
A spokesperson for
Internal Affairs has stated,

02:48.235 --> 02:50.402
"We are no longer
pursuing Mr. Visser

02:50.404 --> 02:52.337
at this point
in the investigation."

02:52.339 --> 02:54.373
When asked if he
would file sui t

02:54.375 --> 02:56.041
against the Chicago
Police Department,

02:56.043 --> 02:57.142
his attorneys stated, "No.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.111
He just wants
his old life back."

02:59.113 --> 03:00.979
Detective McCormack
declined to comment.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.917
A press conference
is scheduled for later today.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.354
Luis.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.890
Luis, how many times
do I have to tell you

03:44.892 --> 03:46.225
to clean out your station?

03:48.261 --> 03:51.230
I'm gone, Eugene.

03:52.498 --> 03:53.999
Use your head tonight, son.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.134
Come on, Gene, baby.
It's Friday night,

03:56.136 --> 03:57.269
ladies are waiting,

03:57.271 --> 03:59.605
and I already got
my shit worked up.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.040
Please don't use
that kind of language.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.942
You might impress your friends

04:03.944 --> 04:05.277
with talk like that,

04:05.279 --> 04:08.046
but...

04:08.048 --> 04:10.282
Man's legacy is all he has.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.318
Gene...

04:15.154 --> 04:16.887
when you gonna let me
have that razor?

04:16.890 --> 04:19.958
Well, I said I would, Luis,

04:19.959 --> 04:22.027
when I see you're
careful with what

04:22.029 --> 04:23.161
you leave behind.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.164
Hey, you ain't my dad, Eugene.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.299
Heh.
Know what, man?

04:27.301 --> 04:30.068
You need to get out,
something.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.236
I mean, would it kill you

04:31.238 --> 04:33.071
to come hang out, man?
Drink a beer.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.973
Have yourself a little mamacita.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.042
Get your little dance on.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.777
Well, you know
how I feel about that.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.678
Come on.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.214
Alcohol says something
about a man

04:42.216 --> 04:43.882
before he gets
a chance to say anything

04:43.884 --> 04:44.650
about himself.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.385
I know.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.353
It says he's having fun.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.757
On that note, peace out.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.567
Yeah.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.402
Hoyt.
How you doing?

05:37.404 --> 05:40.072
Hey, Eugene,
come here once.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.074
Hey, Davey.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.143
Davey over here right
now was just saying

05:45.145 --> 05:47.646
that with a haircut,
I would look younger.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.082
Well, you know,
it's a barbershop, Chief,

05:50.084 --> 05:51.249
not a time machine.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.954
Hey, Gene, you know,
I really appreciate

05:55.956 --> 05:57.055
what you're doing,

05:57.057 --> 05:58.423
you know, taking an interest

05:58.425 --> 05:59.524
in Luis like that.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.660
Train a child up
in the way of the Lord,

06:01.662 --> 06:03.261
and he won't depart
from Him.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.030
Yeah. And when he does,

06:05.032 --> 06:07.032
he'll get
my helping hand, huh?

06:08.135 --> 06:10.135
You come by anytime, Chief.
Right.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.703
Get those ears lowered.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.504
Yeah.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.239
Hey, guys, how you doing?

06:41.502 --> 06:42.968
Howdy, Mr. V-Dub.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.404
How are things?
Working nights this week.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.406
You know, I got that long
drive back to Brule.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.174
Should have went
to college, you know.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.110
Like I don't know
what you want.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.980
Okay, then.
Good enough.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.317
Hi.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.519
Snuck in on me.
Mm-hmm.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.887
Can I get you
some coffee?

07:01.889 --> 07:04.089
You know, I never
really liked coffee.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.190
What else you got?

07:05.192 --> 07:06.925
Some good things
on that menu.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.126
Have you taken a look?

07:08.128 --> 07:09.128
I haven't.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.262
What are you
in the mood for?

07:10.264 --> 07:11.696
Something sweet.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.632
Stay here.
I'll surprise you.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.689
You know,
you're taller than I thought.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.524
Older, too,
but I bet you can

07:39.526 --> 07:41.426
still handle your shit
if you had to, right?

07:41.428 --> 07:43.395
Do I know you?

07:43.397 --> 07:45.864
Eugene Van Wingerdt,
the barber.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.098
Yeah.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.035
It's not your real name,
though, is it, Mr. Visser?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.069
Your mistake.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.839
Damn, the poise on you.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.208
Look, I know they
had to kick you loose.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.643
Lack of evidence, no witnesses,
no fingerprints, nothing.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.079
17 bodies, that's a lot
to walk away from.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.081
Excuse me.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.381
Oh, come on,
Mr. V-Dub.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.151
Chicago P.D.
wouldn't let live it down,

08:06.153 --> 08:07.686
had you pegged a murderer.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.521
God, I bet it was real tough
trying to buy groceries

08:09.523 --> 08:10.889
after your face had been plaste
red all over the news.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.257
I'll give you
whatever you want.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.358
Please, please,
don't kill me.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.026
Dude, I don't want
to kill you.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.361
I'm trying to impress you.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.030
Impressed?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.867
Gene! Are you okay?!

08:21.869 --> 08:23.568
Stop!

08:26.038 --> 08:27.038
Freeze!

08:33.479 --> 08:35.647
You got no I.D.,

08:35.649 --> 08:39.183
and, uh, this name
you gave me,

08:39.186 --> 08:41.119
John D. LaRue,

08:41.121 --> 08:44.322
well, you know, that just
doesn't show up anywhere.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.224
Nowhere.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.159
I mean, it's not in the DMV,

08:48.161 --> 08:50.595
not in Social Security,
not in the library system.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.831
I look like I got
a fucking library card?

08:52.833 --> 08:53.965
Oh, no.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.535
Looks like you're
giving me a false name.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.638
So, uh...

09:00.740 --> 09:04.042
when'd you get into town?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.512
Okay. Okay.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.847
You know, uh...

09:08.849 --> 09:13.885
I'm not some rube
from the sticks, asshole.

09:15.321 --> 09:18.123
I'm Kenosha P.D.,
12 years.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.225
Holy shit, Kenosha.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.526
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.028
Is this a promotion?

09:24.764 --> 09:25.764
Okay.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.236
So tell me a story.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.505
Tell me the one about the guy o
utside of Heidebreicht's,

09:33.507 --> 09:35.640
the guy
you poked with that.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.642
I thought I knew him.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.343
And who is that,

09:38.345 --> 09:40.178
the guy
you thought you knew?

09:40.180 --> 09:41.313
My old man.

09:41.315 --> 09:42.814
Fucker up and left
when I was a kid.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.383
Guy in the diner,
spitting fucking image.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.385
Followed him out,
asked him his name.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.687
The guy freaks his shit.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.388
And so you thought
you'd get some blood

09:50.390 --> 09:52.223
for a paternity test?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.729
Yeah. Uh...

09:57.731 --> 10:01.833
well, the guy
you poked with that,

10:01.835 --> 10:04.436
he's a real good friend
of mine,

10:04.438 --> 10:06.605
so I need to know
why his blood's

10:06.607 --> 10:08.340
on your fucking knife.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.377
Daddy likes it rough.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.121
Chief,
Eugene's out front.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.091
Uhh!

10:31.163 --> 10:32.831
Gene, are you okay?

10:32.833 --> 10:34.299
I mean,
we've been calling.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.034
I'm fine. Man, oh, man.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.470
I must have made
a spectacle of myself

10:38.472 --> 10:39.938
running away like that.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.673
Yeah. Yeah, we were
worried about you.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.875
You get anyone
to look at that for you?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.243
Nah, I'm...
You know, it's nothing.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.647
T-That fellow you brought in,
did he say anything?

10:48.649 --> 10:52.550
Oh, he... he spouted
some bunk story.

10:52.552 --> 10:53.585
What story?

10:53.587 --> 10:55.387
He thought
you were his father.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.454
And it's bullshit.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.690
This kid,
he'll say anything.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.091
I want you to let him go.
What?

11:00.093 --> 11:01.426
I mean,
he didn't hurt me. He...

11:01.428 --> 11:03.261
Well, he stuck a knife
in you, Gene.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.430
No, no more
charity cases.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.633
Wait.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.002
Is he yours?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.405
I'm not
gonna press charges.

11:14.907 --> 11:18.109
You don't have
to press charges.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.683
Gary, we've been friends
a long time.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.252
I never asked
for a favor.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.487
I'm asking for one now.

11:29.489 --> 11:33.291
Please let the kid go.
Please.

12:13.866 --> 12:17.235
You got a problem,
man?

12:20.439 --> 12:22.307
Get in the truck.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.244
Am I gonna be
number 18?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.279
Get in the truck.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.281
Okay.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.725
Hey, this is
a great dump site.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.161
Isolated,
off the highway.

13:16.163 --> 13:16.995
This yours?

13:16.997 --> 13:19.664
Bring me out here
to show me?

13:19.666 --> 13:21.766
You told the Chief
of Police you thought

13:21.768 --> 13:22.867
I was your father.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.135
What's wrong with you?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.637
That loyal prick thinks
you're a saint.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.704
Why would you say that?

13:26.706 --> 13:28.706
Cops liked you
for a bunch

13:28.708 --> 13:29.974
of those missing
girls, right?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.776
But they couldn't
make it stick.

13:31.778 --> 13:32.877
My favorites
were the ones you

13:32.879 --> 13:34.145
put in the ground.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.148
I've never been involved
in any kind of violence.

13:37.150 --> 13:41.085
Come on. Scratch marks
in those pine lids.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.787
I want to know
how you picked them.

13:42.789 --> 13:45.156
What's the trigger?
What's the thing,

13:45.158 --> 13:47.759
goes click in your head, this
one, not that one?

13:47.761 --> 13:49.561
Debbie Ann Skokie,
your first, why...

13:49.563 --> 13:51.196
If I am who you think I am,

13:51.198 --> 13:53.264
why wouldn't I
just kill you right now

13:53.266 --> 13:55.333
and bury you up here
where nobody would

13:55.335 --> 13:56.034
ever find you?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.736
I'm not who you think I am.

13:58.738 --> 14:02.106
I'm not, so please
stop this, please.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.210
Mr. Visser,
I know who you are,

14:05.212 --> 14:07.111
because I'm
your biggest fan.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.947
I get it.
You're laying low.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.915
You're, uh...
You're taking a break.

14:10.917 --> 14:16.287
But I know that
that itch doesn't die.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.256
I know. I live with it.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.859
And if I'm gonna
learn anything about

14:20.861 --> 14:22.627
who I am and what I am,

14:22.629 --> 14:24.062
it's gonna be from you,

14:24.064 --> 14:25.730
a man with
your experience,

14:25.732 --> 14:28.032
because you and me,
we are the same.

14:28.034 --> 14:31.135
I looked for you
everywhere for so long.

14:31.137 --> 14:35.707
What happened in Chicago
was a horrible mistake.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.041
They let me go.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.776
They let you go
because you're the best.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.746
They let me go
because they had the wrong man.

14:41.748 --> 14:42.947
It's cold.

14:42.949 --> 14:46.184
Go downhill
to the highway,

14:46.186 --> 14:47.452
Highway 2.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.487
Someone will
pick you up.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.588
You leave me alone!

14:50.590 --> 14:51.623
You brought me here
to leave me?

14:51.625 --> 14:52.790
What the fuck
are you doing?

14:52.792 --> 14:54.292
Get the fuck
out of the car.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.628
Visser! Visser.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.998
What the fuck?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.005
Monday morning...

15:30.696 --> 15:32.463
Shit, man, you okay?

15:34.199 --> 15:36.234
Kelli, right?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.835
Yeah.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.471
I saw you
get arrested back there.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.206
That sucks.
Yeah, right?

15:42.208 --> 15:43.841
Do you want
to use my phone?

15:43.843 --> 15:45.109
Do you need
to call somebody?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.412
Take a ride into town
if you could.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.314
Yeah, come on.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.151
I been trying to leave
this spank-ass town

15:53.153 --> 15:54.719
for, like,
two years now.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.121
Place like this,
they notice everything.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.723
They stare at me
like I'm a freak.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.526
I just want
to move to the city,

16:01.528 --> 16:05.763
you know,
be anonymous.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.732
Guess I just need
somebody to kick me

16:07.734 --> 16:09.067
in my big old butt.

16:10.202 --> 16:12.403
Do you always
take this highway home?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.472
Yep. There's no cops.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.840
I speed.

16:33.592 --> 16:36.761
Hey, it's me again.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.997
Where the hell are you?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.232
Just call me back, okay?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.176
Hey, baby.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.945
You working the phones
or the corner?

16:53.947 --> 16:55.046
Sorry, tiger.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.015
My mind must be
wandering tonight.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.050
Your, uh, mind
gonna be wandering

16:59.052 --> 17:00.251
during the middle
of my session?

17:00.253 --> 17:02.587
40 bucks,
and we'll find out.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.512
Come on.
Hey.

17:10.829 --> 17:14.065
We have a strict
touch-and-go policy.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.099
You touch. I go.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.635
That's the point.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.637
Okay.

17:21.073 --> 17:25.943
I got something special
for a special fella like you.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.779
C.P.D., motherfucker.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.680
You're under arrest.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.062
Where'd you get those?

18:18.064 --> 18:19.997
Your little bag
of tricks, you perv.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.599
Okay.

18:25.237 --> 18:26.370
Going through my shit?

18:26.372 --> 18:28.005
I didn't
go through your shit.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.874
They were sitting right on top.
I grabbed them.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.282
Sit down with me.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.562
Relax. This is
supposed to be fun.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.695
That's okay.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.664
So this is
gonna be fun?

19:26.666 --> 19:27.565
Mm.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.501
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.942
That's the fun part.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.388
Come on.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.702
Nod your head if you think this
was fucking stupid.

20:39.639 --> 20:40.871
That yes?

20:44.142 --> 20:46.844
Man, I just
gave you a ride.

20:46.846 --> 20:47.979
We're cool, right?

20:47.981 --> 20:50.181
Stranger, motel,

20:50.183 --> 20:52.650
middle of the night.

20:54.219 --> 20:57.355
What the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?

21:02.060 --> 21:04.729
What? Who is this?

22:02.555 --> 22:03.487
What?

22:03.489 --> 22:05.389
You would have
done it better, right?

22:05.391 --> 22:08.225
I mean, of course...
of course you would.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.927
I know. I kinda...

22:09.929 --> 22:11.896
I know. I made a mess.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.065
It's, uh... You know,

22:14.067 --> 22:15.933
it got a little sloppy,
but, I mean,

22:15.935 --> 22:17.268
I passed your test,
right?

22:17.270 --> 22:18.336
What test?

22:18.338 --> 22:20.371
You told me
go down the highway.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.405
"Someone
will pick you up."

22:21.407 --> 22:22.707
You said
take Highway 2.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.475
You said that, right?
You said that.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.377
You were trying
to tell me that... Look.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.145
You knew she'd be
out there, and you knew

22:28.147 --> 22:29.280
that I would find her,

22:29.282 --> 22:31.282
and you put me in the
perfect fucking spot.

22:31.284 --> 22:33.517
Right? Right?

22:40.892 --> 22:41.959
I'm sorry.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.494
Look,
I get it. Okay?

22:43.496 --> 22:45.763
You can't trust me.
Why would you?

22:45.765 --> 22:48.632
I just showed up out of the blu
e
threatened you.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.301
Yeah, why would you
tell me your deepest

22:50.303 --> 22:51.502
and darkest, unless...

22:51.504 --> 22:54.438
unless I got a rope around my
neck, too, right?

22:54.440 --> 22:55.706
Well, now I do.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.542
I mean, bringing me
in the woods like that,

22:58.544 --> 23:00.745
that was
fucking brilliant.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.814
You wanted to see
if I wanted it, right?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.818
What do you want from me?

23:09.187 --> 23:10.421
I just...
I know there's more,

23:10.423 --> 23:12.790
like there's
something else,

23:12.792 --> 23:15.292
there's something
that I can't come up

23:15.294 --> 23:16.560
with on my own.

23:17.662 --> 23:20.464
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.413
Who saw you come in?

23:35.415 --> 23:37.248
What? N-Nobody.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.582
Grace, the manager.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.518
Nobody fucking saw me.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.387
Never use
that kind of language.

23:43.389 --> 23:45.689
I don't want to hear it
out of your mouth.

23:45.691 --> 23:48.192
Can you
take care of this?

23:48.194 --> 23:51.061
You mean, like,
to get rid of the body?

23:51.063 --> 23:52.596
Can you get it
squared away?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.098
Yes, sir. No problem.

23:58.136 --> 24:00.037
Come by the shop tomorrow.

24:02.207 --> 24:03.874
Okay.

24:41.613 --> 24:44.381
Hey, I'm at your place.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.317
Where are you?

24:46.319 --> 24:48.018
What's going on?

24:51.056 --> 24:52.223
Dick.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.833
Hello?

25:04.836 --> 25:06.103
John?

25:52.817 --> 25:54.218
It's a good look for you.

25:58.123 --> 25:59.123
Very good.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.157
That sure... You like it?

26:48.440 --> 26:49.807
What the...

26:54.879 --> 26:56.380
Oh, my God.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.683
Fuck. Shit.

27:03.488 --> 27:05.990
What?

27:16.935 --> 27:19.737
Jesus.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.311
God.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.196
Captain,
it's Detective Bennett.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.498
Can we meet?

27:47.500 --> 27:49.400
It's about McCormack.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.975
The best haircut
I never paid for.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.710
It's always
a pleasure, sir.

27:59.712 --> 28:02.312
Well, next time,
I'm getting a Mohawk.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.650
I don't think
I remember how to do

28:06.652 --> 28:07.751
one of those things.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.254
Be careful out there.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.016
Yeah, you be good.
Okay.

28:17.662 --> 28:19.430
So he pay you this time?

28:19.432 --> 28:21.532
Eh, Chief risks
his life every day.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.168
Haircut's
the least I can do.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.469
Cheap-ass fucker.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.237
Eh, there you go again.

28:38.349 --> 28:39.817
Yo, yo.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.486
What's up, man?
Welcome.

28:42.488 --> 28:43.987
You need a cut?

28:50.261 --> 28:52.629
Yours, Eugene?
Come on, man.

28:52.631 --> 28:54.732
'Cause if he's a walk-in,
I gotta get paid.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.767
What's up, baby?
I got you right here, bro.

28:56.769 --> 28:57.769
Nah, I'm here for Eugene.

28:57.770 --> 29:00.370
He's mine.

29:02.207 --> 29:03.474
Man, this is bullshit.

29:03.476 --> 29:04.675
Come on.

29:04.677 --> 29:06.343
Hey, Luis,
do me a favor.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.245
Go over
to Heidebreicht's.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.379
Get me a cup
of coffee.

29:09.381 --> 29:10.647
Excuse me?

29:10.649 --> 29:12.549
And get one
for my client, too.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.584
Black.

29:13.586 --> 29:14.785
Yeah. Why don't
I go wash

29:14.787 --> 29:16.153
your goddamn truck
while I'm at it?

29:16.155 --> 29:17.821
What did you just say?
Come on, Gene.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.823
I mean, who died and made me yo
ur fucking slave, man?

29:19.825 --> 29:20.991
Shut your
filthy mouth.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.159
Jeez, calm down,
man. Whatever.

29:22.161 --> 29:25.262
No, no, not whatever.
Not whatever.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.232
The answer is, "Yes, sir,
Mr. Van Wingerdt."

29:28.234 --> 29:29.500
I am your boss,

29:29.502 --> 29:32.102
your boss
in this place of business.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.670
Maybe you should
just get the coffee.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.405
Maybe you should
shut the fuck up.

29:35.407 --> 29:36.740
That's it.
Get out of here.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.242
Whoa. No, no, no.
Hold on, man.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.410
You got a foul mouth.
I'm tired of hearing it.

29:40.412 --> 29:41.578
Eugene, look, I'm sorry.
No.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.646
Mr. Van Wingerdt,
I'm sorry, okay?

29:42.648 --> 29:44.181
You had your chance.
No sorry.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.049
Look, you know I've got a bad
temper. Man, come on.

29:46.051 --> 29:48.051
No. You had
your chance. No.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.353
Seriously?

29:49.355 --> 29:50.521
Yeah.

30:07.105 --> 30:09.640
Why do you let yourself
look like that?

30:09.642 --> 30:11.775
What? What do you mean?

30:11.777 --> 30:13.477
You look like a bum.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.812
Hah.

30:14.814 --> 30:17.815
I'm not saying dress
to the nines either.

30:17.817 --> 30:21.251
A man's appearance
should always show

30:21.253 --> 30:22.553
self-respect,

30:22.555 --> 30:24.922
never self-importance.
Hmm.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.891
That's how you stayed
under the radar.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.994
I'm trying
to tell you how a man

30:30.996 --> 30:33.397
should live his life.

30:33.399 --> 30:34.965
Be clean. Don't rush.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.301
That leads to mistakes.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.136
And...

30:39.138 --> 30:40.971
pay attention
to the details.

30:40.973 --> 30:44.007
Gene Van Wingerdt,
pleasure.

30:45.143 --> 30:45.943
John LaRue.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.511
School starts
tomorrow, son.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.420
Hey, Cap!

30:56.422 --> 30:58.055
Aw, shit, Bennett.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.823
I'm late for my grandkid's
birthday party.

30:59.825 --> 31:02.192
John's gone looking
for a man named

31:02.194 --> 31:03.227
Francis A. Visser.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.429
He's going by
Eugene Van Wingerdt now.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.331
He's working as a barber
out in Moraine,

31:07.333 --> 31:09.533
the same guy that you
and his father arrested.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.801
I know who Visser is.

31:10.803 --> 31:13.437
And Thomas McCormack?

31:13.439 --> 31:14.938
Tom was
a great detective

31:14.940 --> 31:17.207
and the best man
I ever knew.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.209
He got obsessed
with this Visser case.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.511
He worked 24/7
and drank himself sick,

31:21.513 --> 31:22.913
and this...
this McCormack, Jr.,

31:22.915 --> 31:25.716
I'm pretty sure he's
in that same brain lack.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.918
Well, maybe John
found something new.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.786
He's convinced
the man is guilty.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.855
So was his Paps.

31:31.857 --> 31:33.190
Tom's cop gut
had him convinced

31:33.192 --> 31:35.025
he always brought in
the right guy.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.526
He became
the worst cop possible.

31:36.528 --> 31:37.895
He went so deep
into that darkness

31:37.897 --> 31:39.963
that he'd never
see the light again.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.665
You know what he did?

31:41.667 --> 31:44.301
He shot himself
in the fucking head.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.171
John said he was killed
in the line.

31:48.173 --> 31:49.473
Yeah, well,
I guess our boy has

31:49.475 --> 31:51.108
a distorted view of the past,
doesn't he?

31:51.110 --> 31:53.176
No, I need
to bring him back.

31:53.178 --> 31:54.711
He's off
the fucking payroll.

31:54.713 --> 31:55.913
He's off
the goddamn reservation.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.315
He's a loose cannon.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.918
Look, kid, I know that
he had a rough time,

32:00.920 --> 32:02.753
but he has made
his choice, Audrey,

32:02.755 --> 32:05.622
and if you go after him,

32:05.624 --> 32:07.057
then you're
off my ranks, too.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.592
The way it is, kid.

32:34.652 --> 32:36.520
Last bell's rung.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.555
Tardy.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.025
How'd you get in here?

32:42.994 --> 32:45.562
Eh, Grace, the manager,

32:45.564 --> 32:47.931
we go to the same church.

32:47.933 --> 32:49.466
Where'd you get that?

32:50.868 --> 32:53.770
This? From a cop.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.572
He gave it to you?

32:56.976 --> 32:58.642
Yeah. He fucking
gave it to me.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.845
Grace saw you
leave with Kelli,

33:01.847 --> 33:03.747
Mr. Smart-mouth.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.048
Really?

33:06.351 --> 33:07.751
Heh.

33:11.889 --> 33:13.523
No more smoking.

33:17.929 --> 33:20.230
What, you never
had a bad habit?

33:20.232 --> 33:25.736
Listen,
everywhere you go,

33:25.738 --> 33:29.006
you are leaving
puzzle pieces

33:29.008 --> 33:31.375
for anyone
who's looking.

33:39.884 --> 33:41.418
Up and at 'em,
slugabed.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.721
We're going shopping
for school clothes.

33:50.962 --> 33:54.931
Have I told you I have
a keen interest in birds?

33:54.933 --> 33:56.900
They're such
delicate creatures.

33:56.902 --> 34:00.337
See that little birdie
over there?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.672
Been watching her
for quite a while.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.375
I followed her
so many times.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.644
We've been
as close as this.

34:07.646 --> 34:08.646
Size 16, right?

34:08.647 --> 34:10.246
Yep.
Thanks a bunch.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.447
Mm-hmm.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.117
She don't recognize me.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.987
She thinks she only knows me
from here in the store.

34:16.989 --> 34:19.489
I want you to follow her.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.827
And then I want you
to kill her.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.263
Forget it.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.563
Listen.
No, no, no.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.598
Listen to me.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.766
I already
passed this test.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.333
In your mind,

34:31.335 --> 34:33.870
count how many times
you could have done it.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.272
And don't
make something up.

34:35.274 --> 34:37.808
I know where she goes
and what she does.

34:37.810 --> 34:40.811
Show me
you can be white noise.

34:40.813 --> 34:43.447
You do that,
and I'll tell you

34:43.449 --> 34:47.417
how I got Debbie Ann
to eat out of my hand.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.719
She's off at 2:00.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.232
So wait. Wait.

35:35.234 --> 35:38.101
She... She still doesn't
lock that sliding door?

35:38.103 --> 35:40.103
Test's over.

35:40.105 --> 35:42.038
You'd be surprised
what people don't see.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.507
I mean, they just
never consider

35:43.509 --> 35:45.041
there's somebody
out there watching.

35:45.043 --> 35:47.277
Mm-hmm.
I get close

35:47.279 --> 35:50.147
and wait for that one...

35:50.149 --> 35:52.215
unguarded moment.

35:53.618 --> 35:55.018
Debbie Ann.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.621
Debbie Ann was
easy to notice.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.523
I watched her for weeks,

35:59.525 --> 36:01.825
just thinking
about the whole thing,

36:01.827 --> 36:03.894
just dreaming
about doing it.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.695
And I see...

36:05.697 --> 36:10.767
this pretty, yummy girl,

36:10.769 --> 36:14.571
eh, thin red lips,

36:14.573 --> 36:18.441
thin line between
white trash and whore.

36:18.443 --> 36:21.611
And I think,
"Everything's easy

36:21.613 --> 36:22.512
for her."

36:22.514 --> 36:28.118
And it just filled me
with rage...

36:28.120 --> 36:32.389
and lust.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.523
And...

36:36.961 --> 36:39.062
when I was done,

36:39.064 --> 36:41.665
when I finished,

36:41.667 --> 36:49.039
I left her Bible open
to Hebrews 9:22.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.874
"There can be
no forgiveness

36:50.876 --> 36:53.043
without the shedding
of blood."

36:53.045 --> 36:57.280
It's not too original,
but I got better.

36:57.282 --> 36:59.082
You never forget
your first, huh?

36:59.084 --> 37:01.218
Or your last.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.320
Great work
with Judy Lynn today.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.422
Tomorrow's my day off.

37:05.424 --> 37:08.225
Got another field trip
in mind.

37:13.664 --> 37:16.800
How many truck stops
do we have in this country?

37:16.802 --> 37:19.069
Thousands,

37:19.071 --> 37:21.037
and every one of them

37:21.039 --> 37:24.608
crawling
with ungodly yummies.

37:24.610 --> 37:27.444
This is the insider info
that you're giving up?

37:27.446 --> 37:29.312
Nope. I'm trying
to show you

37:29.314 --> 37:30.680
the watch trick.

37:30.682 --> 37:31.948
The what?

37:31.950 --> 37:33.883
The watch trick.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.152
See, now, looky here.

37:36.154 --> 37:38.755
That little birdie
has just come off

37:38.757 --> 37:39.823
a long shift.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.726
All she wants
is to get home,

37:42.728 --> 37:44.394
put on some sweats,

37:44.396 --> 37:47.897
and watch a little
reality TV with her cat.

37:49.301 --> 37:51.234
It's raining like crazy.

37:51.236 --> 37:54.437
You pull up and ask her
if she'd like a ride home

37:54.439 --> 37:56.239
or at least,
you know, somewhere

37:56.241 --> 37:57.241
out of the rain.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.309
She knows she shouldn't.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.144
She'll want to say,
"No, thank you."

38:01.146 --> 38:02.245
Mm-hmm.

38:02.247 --> 38:05.415
And that's
when you do this.

38:10.321 --> 38:13.156
That's the watch trick?

38:13.158 --> 38:14.958
You're late.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.593
Mm-hmm.
You got places to go.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.928
You just stopped
out of the kindness

38:18.930 --> 38:19.896
of your heart

38:19.898 --> 38:21.931
to get her
out of the rain.

38:26.904 --> 38:28.038
Who'd you use this on?

38:28.040 --> 38:29.572
No more out of me

38:29.574 --> 38:33.576
till I see you get
that girl into this truck.

38:43.954 --> 38:45.322
Hi.
Hey.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.157
You look like you want
to get out of the rain.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.725
You want a... You want
a ride somewhere dry?

38:48.727 --> 38:50.126
No, it's cool.
One of my friends

38:50.128 --> 38:51.161
is gonna come get me.

38:51.163 --> 38:51.961
That's kinda
why I stopped.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.129
I barely got through.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.098
They closed the road down
because of the rain.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.167
Shit.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.335
Come on.
You're getting soaked.

38:58.337 --> 39:01.004
Um, no, i-it's fine.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.006
Thank you.

39:03.674 --> 39:07.010
Okay.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.144
Wait, are... Wait.

39:08.146 --> 39:11.081
Uh, are you sure
you don't mind?

39:12.116 --> 39:13.850
Yeah. No, really, I don't.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.352
It's not a big deal.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.854
Okay. Thanks.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.584
I'm not done.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.586
Coffee's
from those fellas.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.088
Said black, right?

39:53.157 --> 39:55.291
That right, bro?

39:55.293 --> 39:57.494
Bet you ain't saying
anything now, huh?

40:06.270 --> 40:09.506
I got your "fuck you"
right here, man.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.850
Let me tell you
something, bro.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.819
You see, I've
been pushing a broom

40:22.821 --> 40:23.821
two years over there,

40:23.822 --> 40:27.624
you know, laughing
at his fucking jokes

40:27.626 --> 40:28.458
and shit.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.360
What, you appearing
out of nowhere,

40:30.362 --> 40:31.327
and suddenly
I'm on the outside

40:31.329 --> 40:34.764
looking in?
- Nah, fuck that, man.

40:34.766 --> 40:35.965
I'm in line
for that shop.

40:37.134 --> 40:38.134
Ah, you...
- Hey, hey, hey.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.335
Fuck you
gonna do, huh?

40:39.337 --> 40:41.204
I know you got me fired, right,
bitch?

40:41.206 --> 40:43.006
Hey! You ain't doing shit, man.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.073
You ain't
doing shit.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.241
You a pussy.
That's right.

40:45.243 --> 40:46.709
Lucky these
motherfuckers

40:46.711 --> 40:48.611
don't fuck your ass up right
now. What you gonna do?

40:48.613 --> 40:50.814
You're pretty touch
with all your boys, huh?

40:50.816 --> 40:52.382
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

40:52.384 --> 40:54.217
What the fuck
you looking at?

40:54.219 --> 40:55.852
You two are fucking adorable,
by the way.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.554
Where you going, bro?
Thank you so much.

40:57.556 --> 40:58.822
I'm gonna
go take a piss.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.857
You wanna shake it for me,
you little faggot?

41:02.359 --> 41:03.626
That's right.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.695
Walk away, baby.
Walk away.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.798
Believe this shit?

41:09.834 --> 41:11.134
Punk ass.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.071
Sorry about that.

43:12.957 --> 43:14.257
Van Wingerdt's.

43:14.259 --> 43:15.592
I knew you'd
be there this early.

43:15.594 --> 43:17.760
Yo, I ran into
your boy last night.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.163
I swear, if you hurt him...

43:21.932 --> 43:24.400
Look,
nothing happened. Okay?

43:24.402 --> 43:26.903
But I found something
on him, man.

43:28.573 --> 43:30.506
I don't have time
for this, Luis.

43:30.508 --> 43:32.842
Please, man. Look,
he's not who he says he is.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.747
Look, the last thing
I want is for you to be

43:37.749 --> 43:38.948
taken advantage of, man.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.817
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:43.954 --> 43:46.189
I can come by and show you, Mr.
Van Wingerdt.

43:48.059 --> 43:49.125
One hour.

43:49.127 --> 43:50.927
Cool.

43:58.335 --> 44:00.269
What the fuck?

44:00.271 --> 44:01.271
Fuck.

44:04.274 --> 44:05.341
Oh, shit. Shit.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.181
Shit. Shit. Shit.

44:15.186 --> 44:16.753
No, no! No!

44:17.755 --> 44:19.956
Let's go.
Come on.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.161
Get the fuck down.
Get the fuck down.

44:27.264 --> 44:28.297
Let me see
your fucking hands.

44:28.299 --> 44:29.465
Where's it at, huh?

44:29.467 --> 44:31.267
Where's what, man?
Oh, where's what?

44:31.269 --> 44:32.635
You don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about?

44:32.637 --> 44:33.870
Where's the badge,
motherfucker?

44:33.872 --> 44:35.304
It's in
my fucking pocket.

44:35.306 --> 44:36.472
Oh, it's in your pocket.

44:36.474 --> 44:37.840
I knew you were
a fucking cop, man.

44:37.842 --> 44:40.109
Yeah, you knew I was a cop.
Get the fuck up.

44:40.111 --> 44:41.444
Right over here.

44:42.681 --> 44:44.647
What you running from, baby?

44:44.649 --> 44:46.983
Why didn't you say good-bye
to me last night?

44:46.985 --> 44:47.985
Fuck you, man.

44:47.986 --> 44:48.785
Oh, fuck me?

44:48.787 --> 44:50.720
You listening yet?

44:50.722 --> 44:52.021
You see this?

44:52.023 --> 44:54.057
You're not gonna tell
anybody about this,

44:54.059 --> 44:56.459
not your homies,
not Eugene, nobody.

45:00.264 --> 45:02.732
You know what?
I don't fucking believe you.

45:02.734 --> 45:04.634
I know your type.

45:04.636 --> 45:06.335
You say one thing when
you're playing the victim

45:06.337 --> 45:08.371
and another thing when
you get back to the crib.

45:08.373 --> 45:09.906
Maybe you're just forgetful.
I don't know.

45:09.908 --> 45:11.641
I don't know.
But you know what?

45:11.643 --> 45:12.775
It makes me fucking sick.
No.

45:12.777 --> 45:14.877
So here's
what we're gonna do.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.279
I'm gonna leave you
with something that

45:16.281 --> 45:17.280
you won't forget about it.

45:17.282 --> 45:18.282
Fuck. No, no. I swear...

45:18.283 --> 45:19.515
I swear,
f-fucking swear.

45:19.517 --> 45:21.084
I swear to God
I won't say anything.

45:21.086 --> 45:22.885
Oh, "I swear to god."
Shut the fuck up. You ready?

45:22.887 --> 45:25.922
You breathe
a word about me,

45:25.924 --> 45:28.591
and I will cut your tongue
from your mouth,

45:28.593 --> 45:30.526
and I will fucking
feed it to you.

45:30.528 --> 45:31.528
You got me?

45:31.529 --> 45:32.595
I got you, man.
I sw...

45:32.597 --> 45:33.696
Are you sure?
Yeah, I...

45:33.698 --> 45:35.898
Are you sure?
I swear to God, man.

45:35.900 --> 45:37.366
I got you.
No, no, please.

45:37.368 --> 45:38.801
Please.
I got you, man.

45:38.803 --> 45:40.903
I got you.
So you'll fucking remember?

45:40.905 --> 45:43.506
I promise, man.
I swear.

45:48.679 --> 45:50.847
Have a nice fucking day.
Fucking...

45:56.053 --> 45:58.020
Fucking...

45:59.022 --> 46:00.356
Excuse me.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.559
Here we go.

46:03.561 --> 46:05.328
Hey, mister.

46:05.330 --> 46:07.096
Do you know
if this is the way

46:07.098 --> 46:07.964
to the Vagabond?

46:07.966 --> 46:10.199
I'm totally
turned around.

46:11.202 --> 46:12.468
Boy, you sure are.

46:12.470 --> 46:14.237
It's east about
a mile and a half.

46:14.239 --> 46:15.571
Want a lift?

46:15.573 --> 46:17.406
Oh, no, it's okay.

46:17.408 --> 46:19.375
I don't mind the walk.

46:19.377 --> 46:21.043
Thanks, though.

46:21.045 --> 46:22.812
Come on.

46:22.814 --> 46:24.747
I'm headed that way.

46:24.749 --> 46:28.084
Really, it's okay.

46:28.086 --> 46:29.786
Suit yourself.

46:31.456 --> 46:34.657
Sure it's cool, tiger?

46:34.659 --> 46:37.026
No trouble at all.

46:44.868 --> 46:46.469
You should wear
your seatbelt.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.337
Thanks.

46:54.411 --> 46:57.580
Yeah. Can't be
too careful.

47:01.485 --> 47:04.120
Thanks for picking me up.

47:04.122 --> 47:05.588
Mm-hmm.

47:05.590 --> 47:08.090
I don't know anyone here.

47:08.092 --> 47:11.327
I sure don't mind
making new friends, though.

47:13.463 --> 47:16.199
You get lonely out here?

47:23.507 --> 47:25.675
Where we going?

47:25.677 --> 47:28.144
Well, I know a shortcut.

47:28.146 --> 47:31.981
You know, we don't have
to go straight to the motel.

47:31.983 --> 47:33.983
We can go wherever you want,

47:33.985 --> 47:36.586
and I'll make you
come real fast.

47:39.823 --> 47:42.391
Today is your lucky day,
young lady.

47:42.393 --> 47:44.493
And why is that?

47:44.495 --> 47:46.863
Because I picked you up.

47:47.898 --> 47:51.467
Well, let's get lucky then,
tiger.

47:51.469 --> 47:53.236
You listen to me.

47:53.238 --> 47:55.438
You're a pretty girl,
and this is

47:55.440 --> 47:56.205
a nice town,

47:56.207 --> 47:58.007
but that don't
mean bad people

47:58.009 --> 47:59.075
don't live here.

47:59.077 --> 48:03.145
You really
should be more careful.

48:03.147 --> 48:04.647
Okay?

48:34.177 --> 48:37.647
Look like you had a fight
with a grain thresher.

48:37.649 --> 48:40.116
Luis have anything
to do with this?

48:41.718 --> 48:43.052
Why would he?

48:43.054 --> 48:45.354
Is there something you
should be telling me, John?

48:45.356 --> 48:46.889
What did he say?

48:46.891 --> 48:49.825
That he had
something to show me.

48:49.827 --> 48:51.093
Know what that was?

48:51.095 --> 48:54.397
Luis is full
of shit, Eugene.

48:54.399 --> 48:56.766
If he really had
something to show you,

48:56.768 --> 48:58.367
why didn't he show up
this morning?

48:59.236 --> 49:01.070
Why would he
say those things?

49:01.072 --> 49:03.439
He thinks that I'm here
trying to steal his job.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.573
Did he tell you that?

49:04.575 --> 49:06.776
No. Right?

49:06.778 --> 49:08.978
See, I have been
on the up-and-up

49:08.980 --> 49:10.980
with you since day one.

49:13.884 --> 49:16.752
How'd you do in the fight?

49:16.754 --> 49:19.622
Heh.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.057
I held my own.

49:24.995 --> 49:26.195
Can you drive?

49:26.197 --> 49:27.730
Yeah. Yeah.

49:27.732 --> 49:29.265
You'll come
to my place tonight.

49:29.267 --> 49:31.233
You can't take care
of yourself here.

49:31.235 --> 49:34.837
No, no, no, no. I'm good.
You don't have to do that.

49:34.839 --> 49:38.040
No. I won't take no
for an answer.

49:38.042 --> 49:43.846
I've got a vacant room
in... in a big old house

49:43.848 --> 49:46.882
with nothing
but dandelions

49:46.884 --> 49:50.686
and dust bunnies
taking up residence.

49:50.688 --> 49:51.721
Oh.

49:53.223 --> 49:55.091
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't... Don't worry. I'm...

49:55.093 --> 49:57.393
I'll grab my stuff.
It's okay, really.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.963
Let's go by
the shop and get you

50:00.965 --> 50:02.331
cleaned up first.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.768
You've become
like a son to me.

50:14.378 --> 50:15.745
Have a seat.

50:26.089 --> 50:29.959
Didn't your father ever
teach you how to shave?

50:29.961 --> 50:32.628
It's one of the few
lessons in life reserved

50:32.630 --> 50:34.130
exclusively for sons.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.870
You never watched him?

50:40.872 --> 50:42.071
He wasn't really around.

50:43.641 --> 50:45.374
Preparation is
very important

50:45.376 --> 50:46.475
in shaving, son.

50:47.979 --> 50:51.914
The lather should
always be thick,

50:51.916 --> 50:53.215
never foamy,

50:53.217 --> 50:58.454
and always
go on light,

50:58.456 --> 51:02.124
never heavy.

51:03.160 --> 51:06.128
You sure you want
to get into this?

51:09.299 --> 51:11.500
I'm here, aren't I?

51:11.502 --> 51:13.335
Yeah. Yeah.

51:13.337 --> 51:14.703
All right.

51:17.808 --> 51:19.742
There was, uh...

51:19.744 --> 51:22.111
There was
this detective once

51:22.113 --> 51:24.213
who got it
in his head

51:24.215 --> 51:25.748
I was the guy
for a case

51:25.750 --> 51:26.816
he was working.

51:26.818 --> 51:27.818
Mm.

51:27.819 --> 51:28.819
Couldn't let it go.

51:28.820 --> 51:30.252
Head back.

51:32.322 --> 51:34.090
So one day,

51:34.092 --> 51:37.059
he shows up
out of nowhere,

51:37.061 --> 51:38.360
hauls me in,

51:38.362 --> 51:41.030
and starts grilling me
about some phone calls.

51:41.032 --> 51:42.965
Apparently
this detective had

51:42.967 --> 51:44.266
been getting calls

51:44.268 --> 51:47.536
from some... heh...
phantom caller

51:47.538 --> 51:51.006
claiming he'd
abducted a woman,

51:51.008 --> 51:53.042
buried her alive.

51:53.044 --> 51:55.311
Relax your face.

51:55.313 --> 51:57.246
So he showed me
the transcripts

51:57.248 --> 51:58.848
of these calls, right,

51:58.850 --> 52:01.684
see how
I'd react to 'em.

52:01.686 --> 52:04.687
And this guy
would say things like,

52:04.689 --> 52:06.255
"I took
another one, Tom,

52:06.257 --> 52:08.924
"told her not to panic.

52:08.926 --> 52:12.128
"If she stays calm,

52:12.130 --> 52:14.263
you have
at least two hours."

52:14.265 --> 52:16.432
Every time
another girl

52:16.434 --> 52:17.466
went missing,

52:17.468 --> 52:20.202
he'd get another call
and just...

52:21.271 --> 52:22.771
go into this frenzy,

52:22.773 --> 52:24.773
trying to piece
together clues

52:24.775 --> 52:26.242
before it was
too late.

52:26.244 --> 52:30.779
This guy would ask him,
"Is that enough time?

52:30.781 --> 52:32.715
You have
all the time you need."

52:32.717 --> 52:36.118
I never seen
anyone so angry.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.920
And there
was this one thing

52:37.922 --> 52:39.155
I'll never forget.

52:39.157 --> 52:42.858
He says, "You lost
another one, Tom.

52:42.860 --> 52:45.027
"You never
could figure out

52:45.029 --> 52:48.497
"how to put your ear
to the ground and

52:48.499 --> 52:49.832
really listen.

52:49.834 --> 52:53.102
And the girls,
they never really

52:53.104 --> 52:55.271
could stay calm."

52:56.673 --> 53:04.180
I guess they went
back and forth like that

53:04.182 --> 53:07.283
until this cop
couldn't take it anymore.

53:07.285 --> 53:10.052
He knew there was
something odd about me,

53:10.054 --> 53:12.121
and I told him I didn't
know anything about

53:12.123 --> 53:13.355
the calls or the girls,

53:13.357 --> 53:15.224
but he
didn't believe me.

53:15.226 --> 53:18.093
He was so sure.

53:18.095 --> 53:20.829
'Course they
had nothing hard on me

53:20.831 --> 53:22.731
and had to release me.

53:22.733 --> 53:24.767
By that time...

53:25.936 --> 53:28.737
some photographer
had made me famous.

53:32.008 --> 53:35.711
And that was
when I decided to...

53:37.214 --> 53:40.049
move up here,

53:40.051 --> 53:44.220
start over fresh.

53:44.222 --> 53:45.955
Out with the old...

53:47.924 --> 53:49.858
and in with the new.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.227
Would you
look at that?

53:51.229 --> 53:55.297
There's a handsome young man
under there.

53:58.435 --> 54:02.972
You know,
there are a few things

54:02.974 --> 54:06.375
that a man
needs in life...

54:09.246 --> 54:11.447
and a good razor's one.

54:11.449 --> 54:12.948
No, I can't...
I can't take that.

54:12.950 --> 54:13.983
Please.
No, really.

54:13.985 --> 54:15.117
Please.

54:15.119 --> 54:17.286
I really
want you to.

54:18.088 --> 54:20.389
Thank you, Eugene.

54:20.391 --> 54:21.924
Don't mention it.

54:35.640 --> 54:40.676
Eh, so it's not
the Ritz. Heh.

54:42.112 --> 54:43.612
It's home.

54:51.988 --> 54:55.324
Wow. Heh.

54:55.326 --> 54:58.627
It's just
some stuff I had

54:58.629 --> 55:00.095
and stuff I saved.

55:00.097 --> 55:01.297
Mm-hmm.

55:04.634 --> 55:05.634
You hungry?

55:05.636 --> 55:08.837
Mm, no. Thank you.

55:10.106 --> 55:12.207
Need anything?
Glass of water?

55:12.209 --> 55:15.377
Only thing I need is
what you keep not giving me.

55:16.613 --> 55:20.582
Well, then, maybe you
should boil it down

55:20.584 --> 55:24.353
to what it really is
you're looking for.

55:25.488 --> 55:29.925
They arrested you,
turned you upside down,

55:29.927 --> 55:31.460
and you still
walked away.

55:31.462 --> 55:32.761
That's it. That's...
That's all I'm after.

55:32.763 --> 55:35.364
I need you to teach me
how to get away with it.

55:36.933 --> 55:39.601
Okay.

55:40.604 --> 55:42.938
But not until
you get some rest.

55:44.942 --> 55:45.974
No.

55:45.976 --> 55:47.276
Okay.

55:47.278 --> 55:50.379
John, I'm really glad
you're here.

55:50.381 --> 55:54.116
Heh.
Here for Thanksgiving.

55:54.118 --> 55:55.384
Heh.

55:56.486 --> 55:58.087
Yeah.

57:23.740 --> 57:25.707
Eugene. I need to talk
to the C hief.

57:25.709 --> 57:27.009
Everything okay, Eugene?

57:27.011 --> 57:28.510
I want to report
an assault.

57:28.512 --> 57:29.978
Damn it, Gene.
Are you talking

57:29.980 --> 57:33.916
Yeah, we had a call
last night about a fight

57:33.918 --> 57:35.317
over at the car wash.

57:35.319 --> 57:36.618
You know,
maybe that greaseball

57:36.620 --> 57:37.686
Luis didn't start it.

57:37.688 --> 57:39.154
You ever think
about that?

57:39.156 --> 57:40.689
Luis didn't start it.
I did.

57:40.691 --> 57:43.492
Luis was jealous
as all hell.

57:44.727 --> 57:46.929
I don't want
anything to happen

57:46.931 --> 57:48.096
to him, to Luis,

57:48.098 --> 57:50.199
but I want it
on record Luis

57:50.201 --> 57:52.000
assaulted John first.

57:52.002 --> 57:54.169
Okay. Okay.

57:54.171 --> 57:57.306
We'll take care of it.

57:57.308 --> 58:01.076
So, um, where's John now?

58:02.946 --> 58:04.646
What?

58:04.648 --> 58:07.216
You're sitting there,
telling me you don't know

58:07.218 --> 58:08.317
where he is?

58:08.319 --> 58:10.586
Yeah, that's what
I'm saying, Gary.

58:25.902 --> 58:29.238
I just got a phone call
from Sheriff Pullman.

58:29.240 --> 58:30.839
He's over
in the next county.

58:30.841 --> 58:33.108
They found
the body of a female

58:33.110 --> 58:36.011
torn apart by coyotes
over at Petenwell Lake.

58:37.313 --> 58:38.747
They're still working
on a positive I.D.,

58:38.749 --> 58:42.251
but if that
turns out to be Kelli,

58:42.253 --> 58:44.319
I'm gonna be doing
a whole lot more

58:44.321 --> 58:46.188
than talking to your friend.

59:43.179 --> 59:44.179
Oh, my God.

59:44.181 --> 59:46.114
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

59:46.116 --> 59:47.749
Oh, my God..
I'm...

59:47.751 --> 59:49.651
Wait, wait. What the fuck
are you doing here?

59:49.653 --> 59:51.153
What do you think
I'm doing here?

59:51.155 --> 59:52.721
Have you
lost your mind?

59:52.723 --> 59:54.289
Do you know
whose house you're in?

59:54.291 --> 59:55.657
This is Visser's house.

59:55.659 --> 59:56.992
Yeah, well,
then I'll say hello,

59:56.994 --> 59:58.961
because I was with him
this morning.

59:58.963 --> 59:59.963
What?
Yeah.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:01.029
I hitched a ride.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.998
I gave him every
opportunity to kill me...

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.800
Are you...
or fuck me or whatever,

01:00:04.802 --> 01:00:06.702
and he
took offense, John.

01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:08.604
He took offense
because he doesn't act

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:09.972
on impulse like that.

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:11.239
He stakes them out.

01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:13.508
He plans out
every yummy detail.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:14.743
Listen to me.

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:16.612
I've read the homicide files,
okay?

01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:17.679
Uh-huh.
They cut him loose

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:18.780
for a reason.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.248
Yeah, because they
didn't have any idea

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.451
who they were dealing with, jus
t
like you. No, no.

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:23.685
They had no motives,

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:25.654
no prints,
no DNA, nothing.

01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:27.322
Yeah, because he's
too smart for that shit.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:28.390
He's too clever.

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:30.025
Okay. So what are you
gonna get him on,

01:00:30.027 --> 01:00:32.561
what, the candlestick
in the library?

01:00:32.563 --> 01:00:34.262
I've got him convinced
that I'm a killer, too.

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:35.464
He's been teaching me.

01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:36.932
I've had to do things.
Oh, my God.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:39.267
I got him this close
to telling me everything.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.037
He's lying to you.

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:44.573
Baby, he's not lying to me.
I'm lying to him.

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:46.108
I'm playing
this motherfucker.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.275
He has a box
of this shit

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:48.210
in his basement.

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:49.444
What do you mean?

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.046
It's a front, John, okay?
Uh-hu h.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:53.081
He's playing a part,
just like you.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.117
You didn't hear.
You didn't hear the way

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:55.951
that he talked to me

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:57.386
about everything
that happened,

01:00:57.388 --> 01:00:59.421
the way that he talked
about my father.

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:02.290
Your father was wrong.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:03.392
Not about Visser.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:04.660
There's no way
he was wrong,

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:06.061
because he
gave up everything.

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:10.232
He gave up his family
and his career and his life.

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:13.235
And you.

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:15.270
Yeah, and me.

01:01:16.305 --> 01:01:18.774
I can't.

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:21.543
I can't watch you go
down the same hole.

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:23.445
We can't
do this right now.

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:25.614
You gotta get
out of here, okay?

01:01:25.616 --> 01:01:27.416
You have to go
right now.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:20.302
I asked you to teach me
how to get away with it,

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:21.470
and you never did,

01:02:21.472 --> 01:02:22.938
because you couldn't,

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.173
because you never did it.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.213
The watch trick,
it wasn't yours.

01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:32.714
Kemper used it.

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:35.751
Right here,
there's a chapter

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:38.320
on how to kill people
in your head,

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:40.622
the aura phase, right?

01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:43.358
And then...
And then right here,

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.926
underlined
and highlighted,

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.528
the unguarded moment,

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.663
it's exactly
what you said to me.

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:50.766
What did you do?
You just learned everything

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:51.768
from these books,

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.802
and then you just
puked it out at me

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:54.936
like it was yours?

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:57.939
I told you who I was
that night in the woods.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:01.543
But you wanted me
to be this awful person,

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.478
and I figured...

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.648
who better?

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:07.916
I've lived it.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:10.352
It's because they said
that it was you,

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:11.586
and people believed it.

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:13.622
I believed it.

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:15.257
And then I believed you.

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:18.927
No one has listened
to me for a long time.

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:22.831
I'd almost make it true

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:24.900
if you'd stay.

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:30.572
I got a bad heart,
arthritis.

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:32.140
Life's a gift from God,

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:36.011
and I've wasted it,
no good works, no kids.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.447
There was a lady
I loved once back

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:40.882
in Chicago, Sharon.

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:45.854
I was gonna adopt
her son Franklin.

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:48.723
Man, oh, man,
did that kid love me.

01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:52.994
They handcuffed me
right in front of them.

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:57.265
I'll never forget
how scared they were,

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:59.267
their faces.

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:03.738
The man who arrested me
was so cruel.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.107
He didn't care
I had a family.

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:08.510
He didn't care
a boy was gonna be

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:09.644
without a dad.

01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:15.617
When they let me go,
I went to see her.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:19.054
She looked at me
like I was a monster.

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.859
I never saw them again.

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:28.830
What I did to you,

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:31.233
lying all this time...

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:35.270
there's no excuse.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.840
There's no excuse.

01:04:38.842 --> 01:04:41.676
But if you'd please
stay until after

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:43.345
dinner tomorrow...

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:48.250
you would surely
make an old man's

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:49.252
Harvest Day.

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.363
Yello.

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:10.265
So you two playing
house over t here?

01:06:10.267 --> 01:06:13.835
Don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

01:06:13.837 --> 01:06:15.937
Hardaway came snooping
around yesterday

01:06:15.939 --> 01:06:17.839
wanting to know if I
talked to your boy.

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:19.674
What do you want, Luis?
Well, my last check

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:22.310
and pain and suffering for my
injuries. How 'bout that?

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:26.147
Oh, okay.
Come on by the shop

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.782
couple or three days,
and we'll...

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:28.817
Ah, nah, nah, nah.

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:30.652
Let's do this
now, Gene.

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:41.463
I've gotta go
by the shop, see Luis.

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:42.864
Eugene, I think...

01:06:42.866 --> 01:06:44.332
I won't be long.

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:03.685
Yo, Eugene.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.293
Eugene.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.767
Fucking kidding me?

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:29.711
What the... Hey, let go
of my fucking hand, man.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:33.114
Let go
of my fucking hand, Eugene.

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.724
What's wrong with you, man?

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:55.603
Kidding me, man?

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:57.172
Give me the fucking check.

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:08.083
Not bad.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:35.877
You still there, son?

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:19.888
Shit.

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.440
Yeah?
Hi.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:14.175
Hi.
Mr. Van Wingerdt?

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:15.610
Mm-hmm.
Uh...

01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:17.512
we met yesterday.
You gave me a lift

01:10:17.514 --> 01:10:18.246
in your truck.

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:19.547
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm...

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:23.051
Look, I'm really,
really busy right now.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.386
Um, I know that I...

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.789
I told you that I didn't
know anyone in town.

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:29.257
Mm-hmm.

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:31.426
Actually,
I'm here to see John.

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:32.260
John?

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:34.295
You guys know each other?

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:35.330
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.165
Well, I,
you know, knew him...

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:39.300
heh... a couple times.

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.337
And he told me
to meet him here.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:44.372
Here?
Yeah.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:46.107
I really need
to speak with him.

01:10:46.109 --> 01:10:47.109
It's important.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.676
Oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Sure.

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:49.911
Come on in.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.049
So he's here?

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:58.186
Yeah. He's here.

01:10:58.188 --> 01:11:00.321
He's, uh...

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:05.727
He's out back.

01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:24.046
Yeah.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.789
Hey, Visser.

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:23.304
You didn't think this
was over, did you, John?

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:25.173
You've known all along
who I was, right?

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:27.375
That bit about you
being a serial killer,

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:28.776
that was truly inspired.

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:30.812
And that thing
with Kelli in the tub,

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:33.448
you might just be better
at this than your old man.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:36.551
You may not believe me, son,

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:39.053
but I never intended
for him to go and shove

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:40.355
that gun in his mouth.

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:42.590
Thomas stopped
answering my calls,

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:45.259
tried to go on
living a normal life,

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.462
whatever that is.
Stop talking about him.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:50.965
Girl came around looking
for you, pretty thing.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:53.468
I told her
not to panic, John.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.936
That's the key.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:57.772
She stays calm, well...

01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:59.040
you might find her.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.008
Where is she?

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.844
You have all you need,

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:04.912
one hour, maybe two.

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:07.415
That seems fair.

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:48.990
All right,
get the fuck up.

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:50.324
Come on.
Ah, man,

01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:51.759
you have
officially fucked

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:52.827
yourself for life.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:53.829
Give me your keys.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.096
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay, okay.

01:13:55.098 --> 01:13:56.618
Let's go.
Okay.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.169
Okay. Eugene is not
who you think he is.

01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:02.703
He's a serial killer
named Francis

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:03.304
Allen Visser...

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:04.306
Knock off
the story.

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:06.073
He murders women.

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:07.141
You know what?
Look at this,

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:09.243
this photo,
that picture.

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.278
He ever show you that?

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.979
Look at that.

01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:13.181
He bought this photo.

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:14.549
He made it all up,

01:14:14.551 --> 01:14:16.451
and he's starting again.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:20.121
Chief, he takes those girls,
and he buries them alive.

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:21.722
Is that what
you did to Kelli?

01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:23.891
Did you bury her alive?
No, I didn't bury her alive!

01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:26.928
I left Kelli in her car
up by Highway 2 with...

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:31.299
When you're ready,

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:33.301
drive out
of this shit town,

01:14:33.303 --> 01:14:35.470
and don't ever
come back, okay?

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:38.372
Shit.

01:14:38.374 --> 01:14:40.074
Oh, God.

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:42.944
No.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.752
Hello?

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.161
Kid, get me
out of here!

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.863
Audrey!

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:05.933
Audrey!

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.505
Hello!

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.380
Gary, what are you
doing in there?

01:15:19.382 --> 01:15:21.382
Oh, Eugene.

01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:22.617
Thank God.
There we are.

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:24.352
That kid you've
been hanging out with,

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:25.887
he's gone off the rails.

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:28.055
He's talking about
you burying people.

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.316
Fuck!

01:15:55.318 --> 01:15:56.318
Audrey!

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:00.588
Hello!

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:03.124
Oh, shit.
What do I do?

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:04.792
Oh, fuck.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:08.829
Fuck.

01:16:14.304 --> 01:16:15.570
No.

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:38.693
Can anybody hear me?!

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.702
Somebody help me.

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:50.438
Audrey?

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.440
Hello?!

01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:54.208
Hello?!

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:55.843
I'm down here!

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:57.511
John.

01:16:57.513 --> 01:16:59.246
John, I'm down here!

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:01.649
I got you! I got you!

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:05.820
Baby? Baby, you hear me?

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:10.391
John!

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.461
Get me out of here.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:14.962
Get me out of here.

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:22.870
This must be
real exciting for you,

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:24.905
following
in your daddy's footsteps.

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:26.173
Fuck you.

01:17:26.175 --> 01:17:28.909
Shame the way that ended.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:32.279
Shit.
Gotta give him credit,

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:33.381
real bulldog,

01:17:33.383 --> 01:17:35.282
never let up.

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:36.350
You know,
I've got Hardaway

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:37.352
in the car right now.

01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:38.686
He's got
your fake family photos.

01:17:38.688 --> 01:17:40.087
He knows you're a liar.

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:45.559
You think I'm going down
for a couple postcards?

01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:47.495
Some fairy tale?

01:17:47.497 --> 01:17:48.696
Hmm.

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:50.097
What about
Luis and Kelli?

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:51.465
Oh, Kelli.

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:53.634
I had to follow
the two of you

01:17:53.636 --> 01:17:56.370
all the way out there
to finish that one off.

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:58.072
And I gotta be honest.

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:02.276
With a yummy ass
like that girl had,

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:04.945
hoo, it was fun.

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:06.647
You gotta know
you're not walking

01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:07.548
away from this.

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:09.283
Son, look at me, son.

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:10.951
I'm an old man.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:13.254
I've always walked away.

01:18:15.491 --> 01:18:17.425
Oh, God,

01:18:17.427 --> 01:18:20.828
a lifetime of walking away.
Fuck you.

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:27.501
As long as there's
nothing linking me to Luis,

01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:29.904
I walk right out
of that police station

01:18:29.906 --> 01:18:31.772
just like I did
with your daddy.

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:33.240
You, on the other hand,

01:18:33.242 --> 01:18:35.676
you really should
have been more careful.

01:18:35.678 --> 01:18:38.379
You are leaving
puzzle pieces

01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:40.047
everywhere you go.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.515
You've been
setting me up.

01:18:41.517 --> 01:18:42.616
Ho ho ho.

01:18:42.618 --> 01:18:45.519
And here you are,
the smoking gun.

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:47.054
I gave John
an antique

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:47.955
straight razor.

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:50.591
Grace, the manager,
saw you leave

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:51.625
with Kelli.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:58.065
Careful with what
you leave behind.

01:19:00.737 --> 01:19:02.570
You came here
to bring me to justice.

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:04.505
I'm not gonna
soft-serve it for you.

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:06.674
Heh. You failed.

01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:09.410
Just let... Just let...

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:10.711
Let her go? Nah.

01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:12.880
I just don't think
it's in my nature.

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:15.583
But don't worry.

01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:18.786
It'll be over soon.

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:21.856
And then you'll feel
everything your daddy felt.

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.330
Fuck you.

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.276
John.

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:50.651
Audrey. Audrey.

01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:51.986
Come here.

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:57.725
Audrey, it's me.

01:19:57.727 --> 01:19:59.393
You okay?

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:01.195
I thought I was dead.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:03.364
I always wondered
what it'd be like

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:05.966
to see somebody get out.

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:10.104
Fuck you.

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:12.139
Oh.

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:22.149
Go get the Chief.

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:23.717
Don't bother.

01:20:23.719 --> 01:20:25.753
He's had
an unfortunate

01:20:25.755 --> 01:20:26.755
incident.

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:30.257
Maybe we can't pin
Luis on you,

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:32.126
but Audrey right here

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:33.961
is a walking,
talking piece of evidence

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:35.162
that didn't stay
in the box,

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:38.465
and now we got
the Chief, too.

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:40.801
And you know something?

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:42.837
You lost, Eugene.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:44.405
Well, now,
that's a matter

01:20:44.407 --> 01:20:45.206
of opinion.

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:46.006
Oh, really?

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:47.008
Yeah.
Explain that to me.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:48.909
Girl stays
in the ground,

01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:51.312
another notch,
no big deal.

01:20:51.314 --> 01:20:53.547
But the day
I'm caught is the day

01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:57.785
everybody learns
the real scary truth.

01:20:57.787 --> 01:21:00.154
It's the guy next door,

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:02.656
guy who sits too close
in the theater,

01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:04.992
maybe even at church,

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:08.796
plain, ordinary,
the everyday man.

01:21:08.798 --> 01:21:11.866
That's the guy they
should be afraid of,

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:15.002
'cause they never
see him coming.

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:18.072
It'll be quite a story.

01:21:18.074 --> 01:21:21.976
A son catches the killer
who beat his dad,

01:21:21.978 --> 01:21:26.881
and right at the center
of it all will be me,

01:21:26.883 --> 01:21:29.550
Frank Visser, me.

01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:36.290
I never lose, son,
never, ever.

01:21:40.696 --> 01:21:42.496
What are you doing?

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.699
I'm calling it in.

01:21:45.701 --> 01:21:48.502
Can't listen
to this shit anymore.

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:53.474
Oh.

01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:55.609
Wait.

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:04.285
What if we didn't?

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.321
What do you mean?

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.692
I mean what if
we don't call it in?

01:22:11.694 --> 01:22:13.627
We're cops.
What are you saying?

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:14.695
That's what he wants.

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.130
He wants us
to arrest him

01:22:16.132 --> 01:22:18.999
and connect him
to all those murders

01:22:19.001 --> 01:22:21.402
so he gets the fame
and the credit and

01:22:21.404 --> 01:22:22.269
all that shit,

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:25.005
so the whole world
can see how fucking

01:22:25.007 --> 01:22:26.473
brilliant he is.

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.376
But the only way
that doesn't happen...

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:31.712
Is if we bury him.

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:34.181
If we bury you...

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.851
and everything
you've done.

01:22:37.853 --> 01:22:39.887
You couldn't do it.

01:22:39.889 --> 01:22:41.922
Oh, really?

01:22:41.924 --> 01:22:43.891
You're right.
It won't be easy.

01:22:43.893 --> 01:22:45.759
It's all about adapting.

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:48.595
It's what you've been doing
this whole time, right?

01:22:48.597 --> 01:22:49.997
Well, I'm adapting.

01:22:49.999 --> 01:22:52.666
It's just a matter
of being careful, being clean.

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:54.668
Trust me.
We won't rush.

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:56.303
Hardest part's
gonna be the Chief,

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.138
making that look
like an accident,

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.473
but we'll figure
something out.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:02.176
We're gonna make sure
the world never knows

01:23:02.178 --> 01:23:07.181
that Eugene Van Wingerdt was
once Francis Allen Visser.

01:23:07.183 --> 01:23:09.416
You'll be the first one
the cops haul in.

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:11.385
Oh, I'm sure.

01:23:11.387 --> 01:23:14.421
I'm sure they'll work me
for hours, days even.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:16.056
It doesn't matter.

01:23:16.058 --> 01:23:17.992
If they don't
have the evidence,

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:19.460
they can't hold me.

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:20.361
Isn't that right?

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:23.063
Isn't that
what you taught me?

01:23:23.065 --> 01:23:26.533
You'll never
get away with it.

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:29.403
Maybe, maybe not.

01:23:29.405 --> 01:23:31.538
But they'll never
find out about you.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.874
They'll never know
who you really were.

01:23:33.876 --> 01:23:35.909
Maybe I'll think about you

01:23:35.911 --> 01:23:37.745
on Thanksgiving
when I'm carving

01:23:37.747 --> 01:23:38.846
my turkey, maybe,

01:23:38.848 --> 01:23:40.848
or when I shave.

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:42.449
But no one else.

01:23:42.451 --> 01:23:45.486
No one will ever
think of you, Eugene...

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.822
never again.

01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:50.791
You'll be forgotten,

01:23:50.793 --> 01:23:53.527
like it never
fucking happened.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.735
That's pretty good,
isn't it?

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:03.937
Hey, I had
a good teacher.

01:24:03.939 --> 01:24:05.639
You know, I got
something else, though,

01:24:05.641 --> 01:24:06.573
that you never had,

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:08.609
an alibi.

01:24:08.611 --> 01:24:10.844
Right, baby?

01:24:10.846 --> 01:24:12.079
What do you think?

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:15.682
I can't do it on my own.

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:17.217
You with me?

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:24.191
We better get started.

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:28.429
No. No!

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:29.797
No! No!

01:24:29.799 --> 01:24:31.331
You have all you need...
No!

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:33.700
One hour, maybe two.
No, please!

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:35.569
That seems fair.
No! No!

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:25.853
John, are you okay?
