00:01.296 --> 00:04.388
<i>What if I told you
fairy tales are real?</i>

00:04.390 --> 00:08.301
<i>Imagine, endless realms
of terrible wonders.</i>

00:08.303 --> 00:11.678
<i>Each and every reality
beyond our own is linked,</i>

00:11.680 --> 00:14.127
<i>a vast multiverse
of grim forces</i>

00:14.129 --> 00:16.386
<i>and sinister reflections.</i>

00:16.388 --> 00:18.739
<i>Only the
thinnest barrier separates us</i>

00:18.741 --> 00:20.340
<i>from all of the magic.</i>

00:20.342 --> 00:22.043
<i>All the monsters.</i>

00:22.045 --> 00:26.447
<i>Now imagine, once upon a time,
that barrier broke.</i>

00:26.449 --> 00:30.351
<i>And when it did, all manner
of wicked fairy tale types</i>

00:30.353 --> 00:33.054
<i>found a way from
their world to ours.</i>

00:33.056 --> 00:35.257
<i>That was until
the princesses arrived</i>

00:35.259 --> 00:37.591
<i>and showed us that
magic is real,</i>

00:37.593 --> 00:39.493
<i>and a real threat.</i>

00:39.495 --> 00:42.230
<i>So I founded Looking Glass,</i>

00:42.232 --> 00:44.099
<i>and when death reared its</i>

00:44.101 --> 00:47.068
<i>ugly head once more,
at least I was prepared.</i>

00:47.070 --> 00:48.837
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

00:48.839 --> 00:51.306
<i>Now it's Looking Glass
that protects the world</i>

00:51.308 --> 00:53.874
<i>from any future
fairy tale threats,</i>

00:53.876 --> 00:56.310
<i>though I fear,
with what I know,</i>

00:56.312 --> 01:00.251
<i>that this time
I may need a little more help.</i>

01:23.607 --> 01:25.510
Hey, guy.

01:27.345 --> 01:29.109
You okay?

01:46.162 --> 01:48.031
She's beautiful.

01:49.566 --> 01:51.498
Run!

02:40.517 --> 02:42.484
I suppose it will do.

02:42.486 --> 02:46.654
Looks like Prince Charming
has gotten cold feet.

02:46.656 --> 02:49.623
Take the city! Find him!

02:49.625 --> 02:51.425
Bring back my ring!

02:51.427 --> 02:53.897
For the glory of Atlantis!

02:59.837 --> 03:02.072
I've got a wedding to plan.

03:04.636 --> 03:09.636
Subtitles by explosiveskull

03:12.548 --> 03:15.651
Tsk, tsk, such poor guests!

03:15.653 --> 03:17.985
Of course, the squad's
away on holiday

03:17.987 --> 03:21.423
when the bloody Sea People
start destroying my city.

03:21.425 --> 03:23.224
Hatter!

03:23.226 --> 03:26.260
Hatter!

03:26.262 --> 03:27.528
Present.

03:27.530 --> 03:29.497
Tell me we recognize our

03:29.499 --> 03:31.265
new oceanic oppressors.

03:31.267 --> 03:34.670
Uh, Princess Magdalena
of Atlantis

03:34.672 --> 03:37.505
or "Magda the Mad."

03:37.507 --> 03:39.007
Splendid.

03:39.009 --> 03:40.741
I like her already.

03:40.743 --> 03:42.379
And the handsome fellow?

03:47.683 --> 03:50.718
Charles Charming III,
a Prince.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.754
Of course.

03:52.756 --> 03:57.391
Legendary hero, if
I remember correctly.

03:57.393 --> 03:59.660
He was all set to be wed.

03:59.662 --> 04:01.496
And then just up
and disappeared.

04:01.498 --> 04:05.533
No doubt out to sea with
our little mermaid here.

04:05.535 --> 04:07.603
Why is it always
a lover's quarrel

04:07.605 --> 04:10.771
with these fairy tale types?

04:10.773 --> 04:14.074
Well, that is not
the whole tale told.

04:14.076 --> 04:17.148
Wait until you see
his bride-to-be.

04:26.422 --> 04:29.025
Curiouser and curiouser.

04:36.732 --> 04:39.002
I think it's time
we break the ice.

04:48.045 --> 04:51.280
I'm supposed to be sending
these out of towners back home.

04:51.282 --> 04:54.817
But we're about
to let this one out.

04:54.819 --> 04:56.851
The last time she went
mucking about,

04:56.853 --> 05:00.389
she nearly destroyed
the whole of reality.

05:00.391 --> 05:03.427
Well, desperate times,
I suppose.

05:32.922 --> 05:34.588
- Hatter?
- Yes?

05:34.590 --> 05:37.024
If you would be so kind as to
prepare a batch of my medicine?

05:37.026 --> 05:39.961
- Yes.
- I fear I'll require it soon.

05:39.963 --> 05:41.795
Regular or extra strength?

05:41.797 --> 05:44.398
Both.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.502
Now, Hatter!

05:47.437 --> 05:49.605
Snow White, I presume?

05:49.607 --> 05:53.042
I think it's time we had
a chat about your fiancÃ©.

06:11.061 --> 06:14.295
Magda, baby!

06:14.297 --> 06:15.829
Kill him.

06:15.831 --> 06:18.399
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your
sea horses there, fish sticks!

06:18.401 --> 06:22.906
You kill me, how are you
gonna find your hubby?

06:24.206 --> 06:26.208
I have the city surrounded.

06:26.210 --> 06:31.312
My Mermen searching
block by block.

06:31.314 --> 06:32.781
I'll find him.

06:32.783 --> 06:37.050
Maybe, but I hate
to break it to you, sister.

06:37.052 --> 06:39.887
You're not the only
game in town.

06:39.889 --> 06:41.557
Charming's got options.

06:41.559 --> 06:45.560
Sure, you might
find him eventually.

06:45.562 --> 06:48.930
But someone else might
find him first.

06:48.932 --> 06:52.169
Like Snow White.

06:53.770 --> 06:56.271
What about her?

06:56.273 --> 06:59.876
She's in town
and she's not alone.

07:00.910 --> 07:04.245
And you know this how?

07:04.247 --> 07:06.982
Identify yourself, stranger!

07:06.984 --> 07:10.918
Pardon me, your highness.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.355
Forgot my Ps and Qs.

07:13.357 --> 07:15.790
It's been a while since
I've made a proper interaction

07:15.792 --> 07:19.093
with real royalty.

07:19.095 --> 07:22.129
Name's Rumpelstiltskin.

07:22.131 --> 07:26.033
It's my job
to know these things.

07:26.035 --> 07:29.036
I don't have my resume on me.

07:29.038 --> 07:32.206
But my last gig was
Ruler of the Underworld.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.675
That got boring real fast.

07:34.677 --> 07:37.411
Turns out the dead,
they just love to talk.

07:37.413 --> 07:40.514
"It's not my time!
Not yet!"

07:42.052 --> 07:43.951
Then I started seeing
those BBQed people

07:43.953 --> 07:45.586
that you were sending down.

07:45.588 --> 07:49.990
And I thought, wow,
I have to see her for myself.

07:49.992 --> 07:52.793
Rumpelstiltskin.

07:52.795 --> 07:54.261
I've heard of you.

07:54.263 --> 07:57.031
Ah, so.
You know my work?

07:57.033 --> 08:00.668
I heard you killed Snow White.

08:00.670 --> 08:02.870
Or that she killed you.

08:02.872 --> 08:04.305
Yes.

08:04.307 --> 08:06.374
Different Rumpelstiltskin.

08:06.376 --> 08:09.209
It's a popular name
where I come from.

08:09.211 --> 08:11.913
The enemy of my enemy.

08:11.915 --> 08:15.584
Sure, yes.
Let's go with that.

08:15.586 --> 08:17.351
All right.

08:17.353 --> 08:21.622
If you're such a businessman,
what is it you are offering?

08:21.624 --> 08:23.156
And what will it cost me?

08:23.158 --> 08:25.526
Not only will I bring
Prince Charming to you

08:25.528 --> 08:27.694
and lay him at your
flippered feet,

08:27.696 --> 08:30.598
but I'll convince him
to tie the knot, too.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.232
Hmm.

08:32.235 --> 08:34.034
Well, that's how
it works, isn't it?

08:34.035 --> 08:37.673
He has to marry you?

08:37.674 --> 08:39.474
Yes.

08:39.476 --> 08:42.777
According to my knowledge of
the Enchantment, all I need

08:42.779 --> 08:47.981
is for him willingly place
the ring on my finger.

08:47.983 --> 08:49.984
Well, that's doable.

08:49.986 --> 08:51.318
And while I'm at it,

08:51.320 --> 08:53.187
maybe I'll even take care
of Snow White.

08:53.189 --> 08:58.826
All for the low,
low price of Atlantis.

09:00.296 --> 09:02.431
I changed my mind.

09:02.433 --> 09:03.731
Kill him!

09:03.733 --> 09:05.499
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now listen here.

09:05.501 --> 09:08.036
Hey, if I can spin
straw into gold,

09:08.038 --> 09:10.705
surely I can get you hitched.

09:10.707 --> 09:14.609
Plus, what do you need
Atlantis for anyway, huh?

09:14.611 --> 09:17.878
Once you're leader of
all the land,

09:17.880 --> 09:22.216
you'll be fine once we get
that ring on your finger.

09:22.218 --> 09:23.884
Fair point.

09:23.886 --> 09:25.687
I'll discuss terms

09:25.689 --> 09:29.624
once Charles is
returned to me.

09:29.626 --> 09:32.793
First, I'll need
a show of good faith.

09:32.795 --> 09:35.062
How do you expect to

09:35.064 --> 09:39.299
"lay him at my
flippered feet", was it?

09:39.301 --> 09:42.070
That's the easy part.

09:42.072 --> 09:45.173
You see, these valiant
heroic types,

09:45.175 --> 09:47.174
the more honorable they are,

09:47.176 --> 09:50.812
the easier it is
to manipulate.

09:50.814 --> 09:55.718
And I know a surefire way to
get any hero to come running.

10:08.897 --> 10:11.067
Magda.

11:28.277 --> 11:30.945
Charles?

11:30.947 --> 11:34.115
Oh, I thought he was dead.

11:34.117 --> 11:36.149
He disappeared so long ago.

11:36.151 --> 11:37.317
Where was he?

11:37.319 --> 11:39.821
Atlantis, as it were.

11:39.823 --> 11:41.455
Magda!

11:41.457 --> 11:44.892
You know her, then?

11:44.894 --> 11:46.860
From before all of this.

11:46.862 --> 11:48.763
But what's she doing here?

11:48.765 --> 11:51.566
Well, you may have
saved the city once before

11:51.568 --> 11:55.937
but you certainly made a proper
mess of things in the process.

11:57.439 --> 12:01.008
So far as I can tell,
when your mirror broke,

12:01.010 --> 12:02.743
reality broke with it.

12:02.745 --> 12:06.014
What was once a path to
a seemingly infinite number

12:06.016 --> 12:08.515
of realms is all
messed up now.

12:08.517 --> 12:10.150
Now there are bits and
fragments of

12:10.152 --> 12:15.023
this mirror scattered all
over the bloody world, my world.

12:15.025 --> 12:19.894
And each one is a gateway to
a different fairy tale realm,

12:19.896 --> 12:21.863
including yours.

12:21.865 --> 12:23.999
Should have known one
would have popped up

12:24.001 --> 12:25.903
in the middle of the ocean.

12:26.935 --> 12:28.436
This one is Neverland.

12:28.438 --> 12:30.171
Quite fond of it myself.

12:30.173 --> 12:31.371
Here, you'd never grow old.

12:31.373 --> 12:33.207
It's wonderful for the skin,

12:33.209 --> 12:35.208
if you can stomach the pirates.

12:35.210 --> 12:36.677
And that one?

12:36.679 --> 12:40.248
It's got flying monkeys,
of all absurdities.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.683
And for each one apart
from its place,

12:42.685 --> 12:47.321
it's me who puts them back,
including Magda.

12:47.323 --> 12:52.693
Including you,
if I'm to be honest.

12:52.695 --> 12:57.164
What does she want
and why is she here?

12:57.166 --> 12:58.999
What she's always wanted:

12:59.001 --> 13:00.835
To rule.

13:00.837 --> 13:03.102
One might think
the ocean would suffice

13:03.104 --> 13:04.538
for a girl with gills.

13:04.540 --> 13:06.240
She wants the surface.

13:06.242 --> 13:10.845
She needs Charles
to get it, his ring.

13:10.847 --> 13:15.582
Whoever he marries
rules all the land.

13:15.584 --> 13:17.585
So literal, you bunch.

13:17.587 --> 13:22.456
Well, then, off we pop
to rescue the Prince,

13:22.458 --> 13:25.360
stomp the evil sea people,
and send you packing.

13:25.362 --> 13:27.394
Forgive the rather
rushed revival

13:27.396 --> 13:28.929
but we're woefully
tight on time.

13:28.931 --> 13:33.269
But I'll show you where to find
Sleeping Beauty and Red.

13:46.750 --> 13:47.815
Oh!

13:47.817 --> 13:49.519
Nighty-night.

13:54.891 --> 13:56.593
Heh!

14:03.699 --> 14:06.167
Sloppy and
stupid, Princess.

14:06.169 --> 14:07.768
Thanks, Red.

14:07.770 --> 14:12.609
Here, for when
the magic doesn't work.

14:14.944 --> 14:17.043
Seems like they were
looking for something?

14:17.045 --> 14:18.613
Or someone.

14:18.615 --> 14:20.514
I wonder who got
all these guys?

14:20.516 --> 14:22.015
Maybe Looking Glass?

14:22.017 --> 14:25.086
There's plenty
to go around, Sleepy.

14:25.088 --> 14:28.855
Kind of reminds me
of the good old days.

14:28.857 --> 14:32.527
Nice to see some
familiar faces!

14:32.529 --> 14:34.628
Looks like
you've been keeping busy.

14:34.630 --> 14:37.597
Snow White?
I thought you were dead.

14:37.599 --> 14:41.034
Just been on ice
for a little while.

14:41.036 --> 14:42.669
Where are the others?

14:42.671 --> 14:44.038
Well, if you haven't noticed,

14:44.040 --> 14:46.005
there's been a lot of
heat around here lately.

14:46.007 --> 14:48.274
Looking Glass has been
rounding people like us

14:48.276 --> 14:49.943
and sending them
who knows where.

14:49.945 --> 14:51.446
And now that
there's a whole army of

14:51.448 --> 14:53.214
Atlanteans attacking the city,

14:53.216 --> 14:54.682
they're nowhere to be found.

14:54.684 --> 14:58.318
Well, that's why I'm here.
We have a mission.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.788
- Finally!
- Oh, joy.

15:00.790 --> 15:02.523
But you're not
gonna like it.

15:02.525 --> 15:04.291
Do I ever?

15:04.293 --> 15:06.827
How did you find us?

15:06.829 --> 15:10.197
The mirror...
or what's left of it.

15:10.199 --> 15:12.398
Then that means...

15:12.400 --> 15:13.567
Oh, you're kidding.

15:13.569 --> 15:14.934
Looking Glass.

15:14.936 --> 15:17.039
- Nice.
- Let's go ask Alice.

15:21.477 --> 15:24.879
So, let me get this straight.

15:24.881 --> 15:29.984
This whole entire time, you've
been here literally chilling

15:29.986 --> 15:34.422
and just, you've slept through
an entire enemy invasion!

15:34.424 --> 15:36.691
It wasn't exactly my choice.

15:36.693 --> 15:39.293
If someone would have
defrosted me sooner!

15:39.295 --> 15:41.095
Oh, please!

15:41.097 --> 15:43.431
Every time you royal types
go stomping around,

15:43.433 --> 15:46.667
it's us little people
you step all over.

15:46.669 --> 15:48.001
Well, that's enough!

15:48.003 --> 15:50.537
Like it or not,
it's up to us to stop Magda.

15:50.539 --> 15:52.572
She only wants one thing.

15:52.574 --> 15:54.975
And she won't stop
until she gets him.

15:54.977 --> 15:58.044
So it's up to us
to find Charles first.

15:58.046 --> 16:00.114
Charles?

16:00.116 --> 16:02.582
Charming?
Prince Charming?

16:02.584 --> 16:05.186
Didn't you two have
a little...

16:05.188 --> 16:06.687
That doesn't matter right now.

16:06.689 --> 16:09.288
What matters is if
Magda marries Charles,

16:09.290 --> 16:12.726
she could put the whole city
underwater if she wants.

16:12.728 --> 16:16.165
Who would put that much
power in a wedding ring?

16:17.300 --> 16:20.267
Charles is noble, valiant.

16:20.269 --> 16:22.068
Every bit the hero.

16:22.070 --> 16:23.770
He never wanted to rule.

16:23.772 --> 16:26.474
That's what the people wanted.

16:26.476 --> 16:27.975
And they gave him that power.

16:27.977 --> 16:31.512
Power over all the land
in the form of a ring.

16:31.514 --> 16:34.782
And he wanted
to share it with me.

16:34.784 --> 16:36.517
"Fairest in all the land."

16:36.519 --> 16:39.320
I get it!

16:42.257 --> 16:44.524
All right! All right!

16:44.526 --> 16:47.628
Let's all go back
and get your man!

16:47.630 --> 16:49.230
How do we find him?

16:51.266 --> 16:53.267
Well, that's a spot of luck.

16:53.269 --> 16:55.503
The alley by the church!

16:55.505 --> 16:57.140
Damn, Snow beats.

17:01.077 --> 17:02.744
Shall I continue?

17:02.746 --> 17:04.511
Oh, I think
that will do fine.

17:04.512 --> 17:07.515
If I were the hero type,
I'd come running.

17:07.517 --> 17:08.982
So what next then?

17:08.983 --> 17:11.519
Kill hostages, destroy cities?

17:11.521 --> 17:14.820
Threaten... threaten
to kill hostages.

17:14.823 --> 17:17.124
Threaten to destroy cities.

17:17.126 --> 17:21.127
If you kill anyone,
you have no leverage.

17:21.130 --> 17:22.195
Hmm.

17:22.198 --> 17:24.198
I see.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.932
Well, maybe just one then.

17:25.934 --> 17:27.567
So he knows I greatly mean it.

17:27.569 --> 17:28.803
Magda!

17:28.805 --> 17:30.971
Charles?
You made it!

17:30.973 --> 17:33.840
The wedding's off, Magda.

17:33.842 --> 17:37.444
You oughta know there are
plenty of fish in the sea.

17:37.446 --> 17:38.813
Told you.

17:38.815 --> 17:40.615
You've done enough damage!

17:40.617 --> 17:42.616
I won't let you
harm anyone else!

17:42.618 --> 17:44.250
Not on my account!

17:44.252 --> 17:48.088
Then get down on one knee
and propose to me!

17:48.090 --> 17:52.359
Maybe after
a few more dates first.

17:52.361 --> 17:54.163
Bring him to me!

18:11.079 --> 18:12.613
No!

18:12.615 --> 18:14.347
It can't be! S...

18:14.349 --> 18:15.582
Snowy!

18:15.584 --> 18:17.151
Charles?

18:17.153 --> 18:18.585
This guy's gonna
get himself killed.

18:18.587 --> 18:20.290
Or worse... married.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.035
Get away from him!

18:56.026 --> 18:57.761
Hiya, Chuckie.

19:09.305 --> 19:11.071
Come on, Chuckie.

19:11.073 --> 19:12.373
You and me?

19:12.375 --> 19:14.810
We're going through
the Looking Glass

19:27.223 --> 19:28.625
Yeah.

19:33.695 --> 19:35.098
Oh, no.

19:36.698 --> 19:38.598
- Let's go!
- Okay. Okay!

19:38.600 --> 19:40.867
Wait!

19:40.869 --> 19:42.869
Where have you gone now,
my Charming?

19:42.871 --> 19:45.672
- Again?
- Commitment issues.

19:45.674 --> 19:47.474
Maybe that's our cue too!

19:47.476 --> 19:49.242
Oh, he couldn't
have gotten far.

19:49.244 --> 19:51.679
If there's anywhere I know
you're off fighting some battle.

19:51.681 --> 19:53.950
Can we, can we...?

19:57.052 --> 19:58.921
- Fall back!
- Yeah.

20:01.790 --> 20:03.691
Was it a nice date?

20:03.693 --> 20:06.059
Shame he doesn't seem
to have come up!

20:06.061 --> 20:08.662
Well, Magda doesn't
have him either.

20:08.664 --> 20:09.730
Not yet.

20:09.732 --> 20:12.133
What happened?

20:12.135 --> 20:14.000
We lost him!

20:14.002 --> 20:15.869
Wait a minute.
What's that?

20:15.871 --> 20:18.538
Where is this?

20:18.540 --> 20:20.109
That's here.

20:33.556 --> 20:35.959
Hello, beautifuls.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.494
My darling!

20:41.496 --> 20:44.800
It has been such a long time.

20:48.771 --> 20:49.970
Snowy!

20:49.972 --> 20:51.571
Yes, of course!

20:51.573 --> 20:54.942
We sure showed those fish men
what for, didn't we?

20:54.944 --> 20:57.912
Just like old times.

20:57.914 --> 21:00.580
You and me.

21:00.582 --> 21:02.048
Prince Charming!

21:02.050 --> 21:04.184
Is this guy for real?

21:04.186 --> 21:06.053
I don't see it.

21:06.055 --> 21:08.154
So what happened out there?

21:08.156 --> 21:09.388
Ah, yes.

21:09.390 --> 21:14.461
Well, during the tussle,
I saw this creepy fellow

21:14.463 --> 21:18.799
trying to sneak away
from the scrap.

21:18.801 --> 21:21.768
Now, if you all follow me...

21:21.770 --> 21:24.174
I've been playing around
with an idea.

21:25.974 --> 21:29.343
And I figured I'd use
this little doohickey

21:29.345 --> 21:32.115
here to send him back
where he came from.

21:43.559 --> 21:44.825
Take the gag out.

21:44.827 --> 21:47.728
I'd rather not.

21:51.901 --> 21:54.969
I don't care what
you're plotting.

21:54.971 --> 21:59.205
But I'm warning you,
I'll not have it!

21:59.207 --> 22:01.008
Miss, I don't know
who you are.

22:01.010 --> 22:03.313
But that man is an imposter.

22:05.012 --> 22:07.114
I thought I killed you!

22:07.116 --> 22:11.919
Different... Rumpel...
stiltskin!

22:13.155 --> 22:15.823
Oh, God!
The Gateway!

22:15.825 --> 22:18.094
Lady, untie me!

22:39.482 --> 22:41.917
Snowy! The ring!

22:58.166 --> 23:00.336
No!

23:12.348 --> 23:13.847
I'm impressed.

23:13.849 --> 23:16.151
Hmm, I knew you would be.

23:20.822 --> 23:25.991
You've managed to capture
Charles, retrieve my ring,

23:25.993 --> 23:30.463
and rid me of Snow White.

23:30.465 --> 23:31.798
Where did you send them?

23:31.800 --> 23:35.336
Where? When?
Who cares?

23:35.338 --> 23:40.339
Let's just say I sent them back
to "Once upon a time..."

23:40.341 --> 23:44.848
So save the date, sweetheart.
The wedding's back on.

23:45.947 --> 23:48.649
So what do you say?

23:48.651 --> 23:50.017
Do I get the gig?

23:50.019 --> 23:52.952
He still needs to propose.

23:52.954 --> 23:54.689
He'll come around.

23:54.691 --> 23:59.993
You did... remove Snow White...

23:59.995 --> 24:02.762
like you promised.

24:02.764 --> 24:07.667
Just in case, take a dozen
Mermen into the Gateway.

24:07.669 --> 24:10.837
Orders:
Seek and destroy.

24:10.839 --> 24:13.140
Have it disabled afterwards.

24:13.142 --> 24:15.578
I don't want them coming back.

24:16.712 --> 24:20.080
From now on, no one
gets through this gate,

24:20.082 --> 24:22.415
unless it's under my orders!

24:22.417 --> 24:25.853
Now go!

24:25.855 --> 24:30.093
Your sacrifice
will be celebrated.

24:34.328 --> 24:37.530
You are two for two,
my friend.

24:37.532 --> 24:40.270
Keep it up,
you'll have Atlantis yet.

24:45.675 --> 24:49.979
Pick him up and put him
in something nice.

25:00.923 --> 25:03.159
And kill anyone else inside!

26:04.786 --> 26:06.589
Well, that's not right.

26:14.597 --> 26:17.364
Wait a minute.

26:17.366 --> 26:19.434
I know these woods.

26:23.105 --> 26:25.174
The dwarves must be close by.

26:32.114 --> 26:37.084
Back up.
This looks freshly carved.

26:37.086 --> 26:39.756
I must have just
missed them.

27:20.629 --> 27:22.127
How do I get back?

27:22.129 --> 27:24.466
Where are the others?

27:25.901 --> 27:28.604
All right.

27:30.371 --> 27:33.408
How many of you guppies
do I gotta kill?

27:35.644 --> 27:37.512
I'll ask them.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.618
Old school, it is.

27:55.197 --> 27:56.762
No.

27:56.764 --> 28:00.569
No. No, no, no,
no, no, not again!

28:02.971 --> 28:06.272
Don't freak out,
don't freak out!

28:14.148 --> 28:16.886
Small spaces are no big deal!

28:24.760 --> 28:25.862
Ow!

28:32.001 --> 28:33.569
Just in case.

28:37.873 --> 28:39.705
Thanks, Red.

28:47.916 --> 28:50.483
Hey, hey!

29:34.195 --> 29:36.262
Oh, not good.

29:36.264 --> 29:39.932
No, no, no, very bad indeed.

29:39.934 --> 29:42.602
Don't worry, Alice.
All is not yet lost.

29:42.604 --> 29:44.505
We just need the power core
to bring them back

29:44.507 --> 29:47.874
and we just need
to find them first.

29:47.876 --> 29:49.242
Alice?

29:49.244 --> 29:50.310
Hatter?

29:50.312 --> 29:52.912
I've a present for you, Alice.

29:52.914 --> 29:54.550
Alice, come along now!

29:55.416 --> 29:58.320
Come along now!

30:13.702 --> 30:15.871
Put it with
the other presents.

30:22.144 --> 30:23.546
And wrap it!

30:26.548 --> 30:32.051
Unhand me, you
amphibious abomination!

30:32.053 --> 30:37.891
Now, Charles, is that any
way to treat the help?

30:37.893 --> 30:42.095
You're a Prince, darling.

30:42.097 --> 30:46.532
Soon you'll be a King.

30:46.534 --> 30:48.835
Show some manners.

30:48.837 --> 30:52.506
I swear it, if you've hurt
my beloved Snow, I will...

30:52.508 --> 30:54.644
You'll do what?

30:57.044 --> 31:01.016
Don't think about
her anymore, Charles.

31:03.484 --> 31:06.086
She's in the past.

31:06.088 --> 31:07.653
Impossible.

31:07.655 --> 31:12.092
I think about her all the time.

31:12.094 --> 31:16.332
Every waking moment.

31:18.133 --> 31:22.169
No matter how dank the cell
you confine me to

31:22.171 --> 31:26.006
or how unspeakable the
tortures you subject me to

31:26.008 --> 31:29.075
or how long you confine me
to the darkest depths

31:29.077 --> 31:34.314
of that abysmal abyssal
place you call Atlantis,

31:34.316 --> 31:38.551
you will never touch my love for
her, you wretched water witch!

31:38.553 --> 31:41.221
You fiendish fetid
fish-faced flounder

31:41.223 --> 31:44.358
who will forever be remembered
as nothing more

31:45.424 --> 31:47.896
than an up-jumped
usurping urchin.

31:49.931 --> 31:53.199
You'll never know
a love like that, Magda.

31:53.201 --> 31:55.838
Least of all, from me.

31:57.505 --> 31:59.873
We'll see about that.

31:59.875 --> 32:01.577
Take him away!

32:10.685 --> 32:16.123
You... you said
you'd convince him!

32:16.125 --> 32:18.724
Maybe you didn't see it
from your little hiding place,

32:18.726 --> 32:21.894
but he did not look convinced!

32:21.896 --> 32:25.097
He'll come around, trust me.

32:25.099 --> 32:27.034
This will all work out.

32:27.036 --> 32:29.501
What is it then?

32:29.503 --> 32:30.703
Threaten the city again?

32:30.705 --> 32:32.673
Torture him until he marries me?

32:32.675 --> 32:35.008
No, no, nothing like that.

32:35.010 --> 32:37.144
Look, you've just
seen the opening act.

32:37.146 --> 32:41.213
But now, it's time
for the main event.

32:41.215 --> 32:44.684
And what I have in mind

32:44.686 --> 32:48.422
will take a
little more finesse.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.760
And even you'll play a part.

33:23.558 --> 33:25.792
That's weird.

33:25.794 --> 33:27.796
They gotta be around
here somewhere.

33:41.342 --> 33:43.844
Seven...

33:43.846 --> 33:46.179
Oh, no.

33:46.181 --> 33:47.550
No!

34:13.107 --> 34:18.145
You were always there
to protect me.

34:18.147 --> 34:21.484
I'm sorry I wasn't there
to protect you.

34:22.751 --> 34:25.120
You deserved so much
better than this.

34:31.525 --> 34:34.263
Magda will pay!

34:36.664 --> 34:38.665
The Queen wants you dead!

34:38.667 --> 34:41.636
Tell the Queen
to take a number.

34:49.577 --> 34:51.246
Am I supposed to be impressed?

34:54.348 --> 34:56.083
Well, the hard way, it is.

35:42.631 --> 35:44.098
Five out of seven.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.702
Thank you, boys.

35:53.809 --> 35:57.209
How will you convince him?

35:57.211 --> 36:00.446
Magda, it's what I do.

36:00.448 --> 36:06.386
I'm beginning to wonder
exactly what you're up to.

36:06.388 --> 36:07.787
Uh-uh.

36:07.789 --> 36:11.089
I told you: I want Atlantis.

36:11.091 --> 36:15.562
If I have to play matchmaker,
it's a small price to pay.

36:15.564 --> 36:16.932
Hmm.

36:19.368 --> 36:24.705
If I find out you're lying
to me, I'll skin you alive.

36:24.707 --> 36:29.142
And feed you to the sharks.

36:29.144 --> 36:31.477
Noted.

36:31.479 --> 36:35.048
Now...

36:35.050 --> 36:36.218
Oof!

36:37.785 --> 36:40.789
Hey, flipper,
how's your acting?

36:41.656 --> 36:44.357
One more try!

36:44.359 --> 36:46.828
Aargh!

36:50.131 --> 36:51.834
Unhand me!

36:55.269 --> 36:56.870
I'll never talk... oh!

36:56.872 --> 36:59.372
A little too method there, pal.

36:59.374 --> 37:00.809
Enough, man!

37:04.479 --> 37:05.881
Point taken.

37:07.881 --> 37:10.883
Why not try that on me?

37:10.885 --> 37:14.319
So, what are you in for?

37:14.321 --> 37:17.156
Do I know you, friend?

37:17.158 --> 37:19.028
Name's Rupert.

37:23.798 --> 37:27.702
It's a long story, Rupert.

37:33.341 --> 37:36.310
I've got time.

37:38.146 --> 37:44.049
Once upon a time, I was
Prince Charles Charming III.

37:44.051 --> 37:46.384
And together with my
beloved Snow White,

37:46.386 --> 37:50.290
we had some adventures
together, Rupert.

37:50.292 --> 37:54.428
There was no foe
we couldn't beat.

37:54.430 --> 37:56.763
No spell we couldn't break.

37:56.765 --> 38:00.066
There was nothing in all
the kingdom

38:00.068 --> 38:04.602
that could rival
our combined might.

38:04.604 --> 38:06.240
Our love for one another.

38:08.542 --> 38:10.945
We were their heroes.

38:11.946 --> 38:14.450
I was their hero.

38:16.051 --> 38:21.053
But, alas,
our tale was not meant

38:21.055 --> 38:23.957
for happily ever afters.

38:23.959 --> 38:28.861
Though it was the realm
who wished for us to rule,

38:28.863 --> 38:32.964
there were others whose
jealousy festered.

38:32.966 --> 38:37.169
And none more than
Magda, the Mad.

38:37.171 --> 38:39.705
Banished and confined
to the seas,

38:39.707 --> 38:44.776
Atlantis long had a
tenuous truce with the land.

38:44.778 --> 38:49.582
But the oceans weren't enough
to quell Magda's lust.

38:49.584 --> 38:53.687
On the eve of my wedding,
it was her siren song

38:53.689 --> 38:55.821
that lured me to the shores.

38:57.258 --> 39:00.160
I never could resist
the call of adventure.

39:00.162 --> 39:03.095
And what a wedding gift,
the seat of Atlantis

39:03.097 --> 39:06.234
for my beloved Queen-to-be.

39:08.236 --> 39:12.171
And, surely, I'd be back
for the cake.

39:12.173 --> 39:16.609
But Magda's trap
was already sprung.

39:16.611 --> 39:19.879
I was imprisoned in
Atlantis for so long!

39:19.881 --> 39:21.881
Ages!

39:21.883 --> 39:25.854
It felt like a lifetime.

39:27.488 --> 39:29.421
Now I...

39:29.423 --> 39:34.627
I don't know where or
when I am anymore, Rupert.

39:34.629 --> 39:37.564
Or who I'm even supposed to be

39:37.566 --> 39:42.903
in this strange foreign place.

39:42.905 --> 39:47.939
It's not love for me
that motivates Magda.

39:47.941 --> 39:52.779
No, it's power,

39:52.781 --> 39:54.550
power of my ring.

39:57.285 --> 40:00.051
The power I'm not even sure
I ever truly wanted

40:00.053 --> 40:01.889
in the first place.

40:03.124 --> 40:06.660
So, whoever you put
that ring on

40:06.662 --> 40:09.428
has power over all the land?

40:09.430 --> 40:11.199
Precisely.

40:13.135 --> 40:16.669
We're talking everything?

40:16.671 --> 40:18.372
All of it.

40:21.676 --> 40:22.841
Like?

40:22.843 --> 40:26.345
All the known land!

40:28.617 --> 40:32.250
Pray, what about you, Rupert?

40:32.252 --> 40:36.522
How is it that you've
come to share my fate?

40:36.524 --> 40:37.892
Well...

40:40.327 --> 40:44.997
It is your
lucky day, Charlie.

40:44.999 --> 40:47.100
I'm here to help you.

40:47.102 --> 40:52.004
I've been working
with a third party.

40:52.006 --> 40:53.872
Magda found out.

40:53.874 --> 40:56.542
So now I'm here.

40:56.544 --> 40:59.544
What third party?

40:59.546 --> 41:01.180
Alice.

41:01.182 --> 41:05.852
Well, then I hope this Alice

41:05.854 --> 41:08.421
is as clever as you suspect.

41:08.423 --> 41:12.993
Or else you and I may
find ourselves old men

41:12.995 --> 41:17.132
before this perilous
plot is through.

41:21.336 --> 41:23.669
Thank goodness
you're all right.

41:23.671 --> 41:25.104
Tell me, Hatter.

41:25.106 --> 41:27.040
Have you had time
to prepare my medicine?

41:27.042 --> 41:30.977
Oh, yeah, small dose.

41:30.979 --> 41:32.511
Don't take too much
of that stuff.

41:32.513 --> 41:35.115
You're liable
to stick that way.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.783
Splendid.

41:37.785 --> 41:39.852
You stay put a little
while longer, Hatter.

41:39.854 --> 41:44.156
I think it's high time we got
these Mermen out of my building.

41:44.158 --> 41:48.194
It's going to take
no small effort.

41:48.196 --> 41:50.232
Okay, let's go.

41:54.068 --> 41:56.705
All right, Alice.
Just like before.

42:09.651 --> 42:11.316
Well, can't blame you
for overlooking

42:11.318 --> 42:13.021
the small things, can we?

42:13.854 --> 42:16.654
Uh, have we won yet?

42:16.656 --> 42:18.024
I'm afraid not, Hatter.

42:18.026 --> 42:19.892
It's as I suspected.

42:19.894 --> 42:22.227
If we're going to find out
where and when Snow White

42:22.229 --> 42:23.763
and the others wound up,

42:23.765 --> 42:26.232
I'll need the Gateway
operational again.

42:26.234 --> 42:28.100
I don't suppose you have
any expertise

42:28.102 --> 42:30.401
in inter-dimensional
time travel, do you?

42:30.403 --> 42:34.107
Um, only of
the hallucinogenic sort.

42:34.109 --> 42:37.109
Of course.
Of course!

42:37.111 --> 42:38.678
Hatter, that's it!

42:38.680 --> 42:41.948
It's nearly tea time,
I'm afraid.

42:41.950 --> 42:43.616
Oh, lovely.

42:43.618 --> 42:47.187
Why don't you prepare a
pot of your special brew, hmm?

42:47.189 --> 42:49.455
Do you think it might help
you in locating

42:49.457 --> 42:51.957
our time-displaced defenders?

42:51.959 --> 42:56.127
Um, it couldn't hurt.

42:56.129 --> 42:58.064
Shall I make you a cuppa?

42:58.066 --> 42:59.832
Oh, no, darling,
not right now. Thank you.

42:59.834 --> 43:02.267
I'll need my wits about me
if I'm going to get

43:02.269 --> 43:04.636
this little tumble down
the rabbit hole back

43:04.638 --> 43:06.205
on proper footing.

43:06.207 --> 43:09.209
You stay here. Focus on locating
our lost girls.

43:09.211 --> 43:11.176
And bar the door behind me.

43:11.178 --> 43:13.145
I've a sortie to sort out.

43:13.147 --> 43:15.147
Off to see the Queen then?

43:15.149 --> 43:17.015
Precisely, Hatter.

43:17.017 --> 43:19.553
But let's hope
she doesn't see me.

43:21.722 --> 43:23.421
You listening, pal?

43:23.423 --> 43:24.924
Come on.

43:24.926 --> 43:27.158
Just a little longer,
and this will all work out.

43:27.160 --> 43:30.162
Forgive me, Rupert,

43:30.164 --> 43:33.665
but what's the point?

43:33.667 --> 43:37.236
I no longer care what
Magda does to me.

43:37.238 --> 43:41.473
Snow White is dead.
And with her, my will to fight.

43:41.475 --> 43:45.912
Let this play out just a
little longer and...

43:45.914 --> 43:48.714
No, no, no!

43:48.716 --> 43:50.049
Let go of him!

43:50.051 --> 43:52.350
No! No!

43:52.352 --> 43:55.156
Rupert!
Aargh!

44:00.194 --> 44:02.028
Well?

44:02.030 --> 44:04.330
Woo, boy!

44:04.332 --> 44:06.031
Tough nut to crack.

44:06.033 --> 44:08.033
Your boy is depressed.

44:08.035 --> 44:12.538
It looks like your plan to get
rid of Snow White failed then!

44:12.540 --> 44:14.372
He's lost his will to live.

44:14.374 --> 44:17.410
And I need him pliable.

44:17.412 --> 44:19.779
Back to Plan A then.

44:19.781 --> 44:21.513
Sorry, deal's off!

44:21.515 --> 44:24.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Listen.

44:24.519 --> 44:27.319
If he's lost his will to live,

44:27.321 --> 44:30.656
we just have to give him
something to live for.

44:30.658 --> 44:33.627
You better know
what you're doing.

44:38.932 --> 44:41.202
No!

44:54.214 --> 44:56.684
Rupert, you're alive.

44:59.453 --> 45:03.154
Magda. She knows.

45:03.156 --> 45:05.823
Knows I'm a double agent.

45:05.825 --> 45:10.296
And she had questions.

45:10.298 --> 45:13.531
And I gather she didn't
ask them very nicely.

45:13.533 --> 45:15.734
I didn't answer any of them.

45:15.736 --> 45:19.337
Well, good on you
then, Rupert.

45:19.339 --> 45:22.544
I did gather
some information.

45:24.312 --> 45:25.647
Snow White?

45:28.917 --> 45:30.485
She's alive.

45:54.376 --> 45:56.745
Wait for it...

46:01.149 --> 46:03.251
50 degrees west.

46:07.488 --> 46:09.823
Change by six
degrees for the wind.

46:13.827 --> 46:17.932
Three targets all
lined up in a row.

46:28.910 --> 46:29.944
Idiots.

46:31.546 --> 46:35.548
Their average response time
is three minutes and 48 seconds.

46:35.550 --> 46:38.283
It's an all you can eat
seafood buffet out here, Snow.

46:38.285 --> 46:39.886
And there's gonna
be more coming up.

46:39.888 --> 46:44.957
Soon as I kill one,
another school shows up.

46:44.959 --> 46:46.994
I'm down to just with my arrows.

46:48.162 --> 46:50.162
I ran into one too.

46:50.164 --> 46:51.497
But this one was different.

46:51.499 --> 46:53.165
He was ready for me.

46:53.167 --> 46:55.734
Yeah. I'm pretty sure the last
time I was in these woods,

46:55.736 --> 46:58.169
they weren't crawling
with Magda's Mermen.

46:58.171 --> 47:01.173
Something's different.

47:01.175 --> 47:03.341
It's really changed.

47:03.343 --> 47:06.078
If Magda somehow
marries Charles,

47:06.080 --> 47:08.881
she controls all the land.

47:08.883 --> 47:11.015
Including the Gateway.

47:11.017 --> 47:13.986
Red, I don't think
we were just sent back home.

47:13.988 --> 47:17.756
I think we were sent back
in time or to another dimension.

47:17.758 --> 47:19.459
We need to figure out
how to get back

47:19.461 --> 47:21.627
and then we can fix all of this!

47:21.629 --> 47:25.631
If Magda's using the Gateway
to send back all these Mermen...

47:25.633 --> 47:27.600
Then we could
use it to get back!

47:27.602 --> 47:30.602
Why else would she be sending
all these Mermen to get us

47:30.604 --> 47:32.437
and anyone who would help us?

47:32.439 --> 47:34.506
We need to get back
to before the wedding.

47:34.508 --> 47:38.176
Then we could prevent all
of this from happening.

47:38.178 --> 47:40.145
Do you know which way
the Mermen were coming from?

47:40.147 --> 47:41.580
Yeah.

47:41.582 --> 47:44.183
Somewhere back that way
where I came from.

47:44.185 --> 47:47.252
- You know the way?
- Sure.

47:47.254 --> 47:50.392
Just, you know,
follow the bread crumbs.

48:04.138 --> 48:07.509
Let's see those gills
handle a full dose.

48:09.843 --> 48:11.546
Come on.

48:21.222 --> 48:22.955
That's right.

48:22.957 --> 48:25.093
Breathe it in.

48:32.300 --> 48:34.002
Now do as I say!

48:37.838 --> 48:39.540
Come on.

48:44.044 --> 48:45.713
Goodie!

48:54.155 --> 48:56.057
I'm not so stupid, after all.

49:02.330 --> 49:03.798
This'll do nicely.

49:07.734 --> 49:09.368
Oh, that must be
Sleeping Beauty.

49:09.370 --> 49:12.037
Good for her. I thought we'd
have to rescue her.

49:12.039 --> 49:14.071
Well, that's not
very far from here.

49:14.073 --> 49:15.439
Yeah. It looks like it's
where we're headed.

49:15.441 --> 49:17.176
But it could be a trap.

49:17.178 --> 49:18.511
- Can we afford to be careful?
- No. She could be in trouble.

49:18.513 --> 49:21.080
We'd better hurry.

49:21.082 --> 49:24.249
So what's the plan?
Where is Snow White?

49:24.251 --> 49:26.953
Surely, you have a way
of getting us out then?

49:26.955 --> 49:28.386
Better.

49:28.388 --> 49:29.488
What if I told you there is a

49:29.490 --> 49:30.522
way of getting you out of here

49:30.524 --> 49:32.325
and to marry Snow White?

49:32.327 --> 49:33.457
How, man?

49:33.459 --> 49:35.127
Easy.
All you have to do is...

49:35.129 --> 49:36.662
Oh.

49:36.664 --> 49:37.863
No. No, no, no!

49:39.167 --> 49:40.966
No!

49:40.968 --> 49:42.535
Come on!

49:42.537 --> 49:44.002
How? How?

49:44.004 --> 49:45.537
Rupert, how?

49:45.539 --> 49:47.573
How, Rupert!
Rupert!

49:50.176 --> 49:52.812
Time's up, sweet talker!

49:52.814 --> 49:55.113
Easy!

49:55.115 --> 49:58.452
He bought it,
hook, line and sinker!

50:01.354 --> 50:03.256
Just give it some time.

50:03.258 --> 50:04.723
Let it marinate.

50:04.725 --> 50:06.158
And you'll be the happy

50:06.160 --> 50:07.792
couple before you know it.

50:07.794 --> 50:09.428
I'm going to ask him myself.

50:09.430 --> 50:11.529
No, no, no, no!

50:11.531 --> 50:17.270
Look, the groom can't see
the bride before the wedding.

50:17.272 --> 50:19.037
Why don't you go?
Get spruced up.

50:19.039 --> 50:22.140
I'll bring him to the altar
when it's time.

50:22.142 --> 50:24.977
It better be soon.

50:24.979 --> 50:27.613
For all we know,
Snow White and her Avengers

50:27.615 --> 50:30.549
could have found a way back!

50:30.551 --> 50:34.653
I don't want any
uninvited guests.

50:34.655 --> 50:36.754
I should have
killed them myself.

50:36.756 --> 50:40.191
No. Trust me.
Give it time.

50:40.193 --> 50:41.993
You'll be glad you did.

50:41.995 --> 50:44.531
One hour!

50:50.203 --> 50:51.571
Rumpelstiltskin!

50:51.573 --> 50:53.305
Oh!

50:53.307 --> 50:54.839
That's your trick!

50:54.841 --> 50:56.674
What are you doing here?

50:56.676 --> 50:59.611
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

50:59.613 --> 51:01.613
When I last checked,
you were happily running

51:01.615 --> 51:04.448
the Underworld with
the Queen of Hearts.

51:04.450 --> 51:06.953
How is Gelda, by the way?

51:06.955 --> 51:10.622
Good, I think.

51:10.624 --> 51:12.725
You two don't still talk,
do you?

51:12.727 --> 51:14.426
Oh, but we can.

51:14.428 --> 51:17.229
And I'd be happy to inform her
of your current whereabouts

51:17.231 --> 51:19.330
unless you tell me
exactly what's going on!

51:19.332 --> 51:23.569
The wedding is in an hour.
But I have a plan.

51:23.571 --> 51:25.370
Of course, you do.

51:25.372 --> 51:27.575
And why should I trust you?

51:29.510 --> 51:33.678
Look, okay, Alice.

51:33.680 --> 51:38.049
Yes, did I help Magda
capture Prince Charming?

51:38.051 --> 51:41.252
And get rid of the Avengers?
Yes.

51:41.254 --> 51:46.591
But it was a con and
it didn't pan out.

51:46.593 --> 51:49.495
I think she's catching
on to me.

51:49.497 --> 51:50.796
She's crazy.

51:50.798 --> 51:53.131
They don't call her Magda,

51:53.133 --> 51:54.700
the Mad for nothing.

51:54.702 --> 51:57.602
Anyway, it's good thing
that you're here.

51:57.604 --> 51:59.270
I need a way out.

51:59.272 --> 52:02.908
And how do I know this isn't
just part of your scheme?

52:02.910 --> 52:08.013
You don't, but what if
I got you the power core

52:08.015 --> 52:10.816
and showed you where
Price Charles is, huh?

52:10.818 --> 52:12.917
We could call it a wash?

52:12.919 --> 52:16.921
If I could free Charming
and reopen the Gateway,

52:16.923 --> 52:19.258
then we'd rid ourselves
of this whole mess.

52:19.260 --> 52:23.294
Oh, deal.

52:23.296 --> 52:25.397
Now where is he?

52:25.399 --> 52:27.167
Right this way.

52:30.470 --> 52:33.738
Why is it every time I find
myself in a mess, I also find...

52:33.740 --> 52:36.475
What is this?
Who is she?

52:36.477 --> 52:38.144
You!

52:38.146 --> 52:39.544
I found her running
around trying

52:39.546 --> 52:40.745
to sneak off with your man.

52:40.747 --> 52:43.984
Then I guess she... dies!

52:45.385 --> 52:46.685
Oh!

52:46.687 --> 52:49.624
Where is she?
After her!

52:54.193 --> 52:57.895
I'll make sure you regret this,
Rumpelstiltskin!

52:57.897 --> 52:59.934
Sorry, small stuff.

53:04.638 --> 53:06.238
Oh!

53:06.240 --> 53:09.707
All right, Alice,
time to crack on!

53:09.709 --> 53:11.845
Oh, bugger!

53:18.586 --> 53:22.421
Well, it looks like I can
trust you, after all.

53:22.423 --> 53:27.694
Hmm. Magda, no one's gonna
crash your wedding.

53:29.629 --> 53:31.796
I still don't understand.

53:31.798 --> 53:35.267
In the present... or the
future,

53:35.269 --> 53:37.870
if Magda marries
your boy Charming,

53:37.872 --> 53:39.370
then she controls all of time?

53:39.372 --> 53:43.375
Because we weren't
there to stop her.

53:43.377 --> 53:45.511
All we have to do
is find a way back.

53:45.513 --> 53:47.078
Then we can undo
all of this.

53:47.080 --> 53:48.647
If we get back
to the right time.

53:48.649 --> 53:50.616
Yeah.
I know it's confusing.

53:50.618 --> 53:51.649
But all we have to focus
on right now

53:51.651 --> 53:53.419
is getting out of here!

53:53.421 --> 53:54.852
We're not gonna do anyone
any good if we're stuck

53:54.854 --> 53:55.854
in the past or some

53:55.856 --> 53:57.355
time-warp dimension!

53:57.357 --> 53:58.957
We're gonna have to time
this really carefully.

53:58.959 --> 54:00.658
First, we're gonna have
to find Sleeping Beauty.

54:00.660 --> 54:03.828
Then we're gonna figure out
a way to lure the Mermen here.

54:03.830 --> 54:05.196
Then we'll kill them.

54:05.198 --> 54:06.564
Then, hopefully,
the Gateway will open up

54:06.566 --> 54:09.500
and we'll just jump through it!

54:09.502 --> 54:10.972
Or we can wing it.

54:15.843 --> 54:17.508
Oh, hey.

54:17.510 --> 54:20.147
Now's our chance!
Move it or lose it, Sleepy!

54:23.482 --> 54:26.852
No, no, no, no, no!

54:26.854 --> 54:29.055
Please tell me
this wasn't part of your plan.

54:29.057 --> 54:30.154
No!

54:30.156 --> 54:31.355
We must have gone too far.

54:31.357 --> 54:32.625
I don't understand it!

54:32.627 --> 54:34.359
Is this where the Mermen
are coming from?

54:34.361 --> 54:36.428
You mean, is this when
the Mermen were coming from?

54:36.430 --> 54:38.964
I guess Magda got what
she wanted after all.

54:38.966 --> 54:41.732
Sure looks like she made
herself at home.

54:41.734 --> 54:44.035
Without us here to stop her.

54:44.037 --> 54:47.573
She must have found
a way to marry Charles.

54:47.575 --> 54:49.475
He must be around
here somewhere.

54:49.477 --> 54:52.944
So, right place, wrong time.

54:52.946 --> 54:56.814
Exactly, and I'm willing
to bet there's a way outta here.

54:56.816 --> 54:57.883
Looking Glass.

54:57.885 --> 54:59.821
There again?

55:01.488 --> 55:02.886
Think about it!

55:02.888 --> 55:04.555
Where else are the Mermen

55:04.557 --> 55:06.024
coming from if not here?

55:06.026 --> 55:07.926
Magda's probably been sending

55:07.928 --> 55:09.828
Mermen back for ages to kill us!

55:09.830 --> 55:11.363
There's still a chance.

55:11.365 --> 55:14.301
Yeah, if everyone
isn't already dead.

55:15.468 --> 55:17.771
There's only one way
to find out.

55:27.981 --> 55:30.917
Doesn't look exactly up
and running these days.

55:33.921 --> 55:35.986
There has to be a way.

55:35.988 --> 55:37.723
Magda might be crazy

55:37.725 --> 55:41.459
but she wouldn't just destroy
the Gateway now, would she?

55:41.461 --> 55:42.993
Wait!

55:42.995 --> 55:44.932
Does that mean
we're stuck here?

55:47.334 --> 55:49.169
I'd rather be back
in the coffin.

55:51.272 --> 55:53.571
Long story.

55:53.573 --> 55:57.408
Oh! How did this happen?

55:57.410 --> 55:58.445
I gave up.

56:00.314 --> 56:02.016
Charles...

56:09.955 --> 56:11.423
Oh, my Charles.

56:11.425 --> 56:14.558
My Charming.

56:14.560 --> 56:19.730
I'm so sorry, Snowy.

56:19.732 --> 56:21.868
I thought you died.

56:24.839 --> 56:27.973
I lost my will to fight her.

56:27.975 --> 56:32.977
I lost everything.

56:32.979 --> 56:38.549
After she took control,
I... I...

56:38.551 --> 56:43.990
My sweet, I just knew
I would see you again.

56:46.225 --> 56:49.296
I'm so sorry things
turned out the way they did.

56:52.165 --> 56:55.569
You've been gone for so long.

56:57.470 --> 57:01.074
We all lost hope that
you'd ever make it back.

57:02.510 --> 57:06.881
And now that you have,
it's too late.

57:10.818 --> 57:14.319
She broke me, Snowy.

57:14.321 --> 57:18.960
After we...
after she...

57:19.892 --> 57:24.331
Hey, hey, it's okay.

57:25.164 --> 57:29.299
After she got my ring,

57:29.301 --> 57:33.140
she had no use
for me anymore.

57:34.807 --> 57:38.544
And without my power,

57:38.546 --> 57:43.515
well, I'm not the man
I used to be.

57:43.517 --> 57:46.984
I'll fix this,
all of this, Charles.

57:46.986 --> 57:48.220
We just have to get back
to the Gateway...

57:48.222 --> 57:49.787
You can't!
You can't!

57:49.789 --> 57:52.089
I will.

57:52.091 --> 57:55.229
Oh, my darling,
how long has it been?

57:55.995 --> 57:59.064
Too long.

57:59.066 --> 58:00.131
You just have to
tell me what's happened

58:00.133 --> 58:03.535
in all this time.

58:03.537 --> 58:05.372
I'll show you.

58:08.374 --> 58:12.044
Once Magda gained control,

58:12.046 --> 58:16.548
it still wasn't
enough for her.

58:16.550 --> 58:22.153
She became paranoid, afraid
that one day you'd come back.

58:22.155 --> 58:25.689
For years, she sent Mermen
through the Gateway

58:25.691 --> 58:28.959
to find you, to kill you.

58:28.961 --> 58:30.462
We know how that turned out.

58:30.464 --> 58:32.964
Now she never leaves
that Throne Room.

58:32.966 --> 58:35.933
We fought her for
as long as we could.

58:35.935 --> 58:40.138
But she controls all the land.

58:40.140 --> 58:43.908
I am the only one
she can't command.

58:43.910 --> 58:46.713
And, well, am now an old man.

58:48.348 --> 58:49.548
We?

58:49.550 --> 58:51.950
We who, Charles?

58:51.952 --> 58:54.886
Who am I?

58:54.888 --> 58:58.022
That is a great puzzle.

58:58.024 --> 58:59.624
Alice?

58:59.626 --> 59:01.493
I think I once was.

59:01.495 --> 59:07.064
But I must have changed
several times since then.

59:07.066 --> 59:09.801
What happened to her?

59:09.803 --> 59:12.970
I can't explain myself to you

59:12.972 --> 59:16.207
because I'm not myself.

59:16.209 --> 59:20.178
She's been this way since...

59:20.180 --> 59:21.749
since Hatter died.

59:23.984 --> 59:26.017
Feels like forever.

59:26.019 --> 59:29.488
Sometimes forever
is just a second.

59:29.490 --> 59:31.955
No kidding.

59:31.957 --> 59:33.158
Alice?

59:33.160 --> 59:35.093
If you're in there,

59:35.095 --> 59:37.162
there's still hope.

59:37.164 --> 59:39.732
We just need to get back
to before the wedding.

59:39.734 --> 59:42.703
Before all this happened,
we could stop it.

59:44.772 --> 59:47.337
Can you help us fix the Gateway?

59:47.339 --> 59:49.075
Can you send us back?

59:51.912 --> 59:55.147
I can't go back to yesterday.

59:55.149 --> 59:57.948
I was a different person then.

59:57.950 --> 59:59.984
God, she's bonkers!

59:59.986 --> 01:00:02.053
The best people are.

01:00:02.055 --> 01:00:04.022
You must be mad, too.

01:00:04.024 --> 01:00:06.124
Else you wouldn't
have come here.

01:00:06.126 --> 01:00:08.727
Okay, so Alice is nuts.

01:00:08.729 --> 01:00:12.230
And Charming here is
an old geezer... no offense.

01:00:12.232 --> 01:00:15.033
So what now?

01:00:15.035 --> 01:00:17.035
We bring the fight
back to Magda?

01:00:17.037 --> 01:00:18.502
No!

01:00:18.504 --> 01:00:20.272
Our battle is in the past!

01:00:20.274 --> 01:00:23.040
Uh, you mean present.

01:00:23.042 --> 01:00:25.843
It's not here!
It's not now!

01:00:25.845 --> 01:00:29.413
It doesn't do us or them
any good to fight her here!

01:00:29.415 --> 01:00:33.252
We need to get back before
the wedding ever happened!

01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:36.553
That's what started all of this!

01:00:36.555 --> 01:00:39.057
But you're half right.
We're going to see Magda.

01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:41.526
If she's been sending
the Mermen back all this time,

01:00:41.528 --> 01:00:44.895
she has a way
to open the Gateway.

01:00:44.897 --> 01:00:47.165
So we get in,
we figure out how

01:00:47.167 --> 01:00:51.102
and we get out,
preferably unseen.

01:00:51.104 --> 01:00:53.339
Stealth, I can do.

01:00:56.575 --> 01:01:01.779
Darling, can you
show us the way?

01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:03.816
No.

01:01:03.818 --> 01:01:06.283
The place is filled with Mermen

01:01:06.285 --> 01:01:09.687
and I fear I...

01:01:09.689 --> 01:01:12.792
I fear I wouldn't be
any good in a fight.

01:01:14.627 --> 01:01:19.363
Follow this path,
but be careful, Snowy.

01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:22.466
If she hears you,
she knows you're there,

01:01:22.468 --> 01:01:24.968
it will be too late.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:26.404
My ring.

01:01:26.406 --> 01:01:29.276
She commands anyone
who hears her.

01:01:31.944 --> 01:01:34.115
Now go.

01:01:38.952 --> 01:01:40.787
Go.

01:01:46.126 --> 01:01:49.560
Why aren't you in your cell?

01:01:49.562 --> 01:01:52.330
You know I don't like you
skulking around at night.

01:01:52.332 --> 01:01:54.332
You already tried
to betray me once!

01:01:54.334 --> 01:01:56.968
Did you forget?

01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:58.770
No! No, my Queen! No.

01:01:58.772 --> 01:02:01.839
I just thought that I could
be out if I were cleaning...

01:02:01.841 --> 01:02:04.508
You thought... wrong.

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:07.278
I'm sorry.
It's just that...

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.850
Get back to your cell.

01:02:11.852 --> 01:02:15.285
I'll just...

01:02:15.287 --> 01:02:17.020
Please don't make me go!

01:02:17.022 --> 01:02:22.629
I said get back
to your cell.

01:02:25.198 --> 01:02:27.600
Y.. Yes, my Queen.

01:02:51.156 --> 01:02:54.526
If only I could spin this straw
into something more useful.

01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:02.801
You're back!

01:03:02.803 --> 01:03:04.935
Shh!

01:03:04.937 --> 01:03:06.270
But you're back...

01:03:06.272 --> 01:03:07.538
Oh, we are not here
to rescue you.

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.006
This is all your fault.

01:03:09.008 --> 01:03:10.975
You're lucky I don't kill you!

01:03:10.977 --> 01:03:13.310
Oh, sweet death.

01:03:13.312 --> 01:03:15.312
Wait.
Then why are you here?

01:03:15.314 --> 01:03:16.348
We need to get
back to the past

01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:18.049
and fix your mess.

01:03:18.051 --> 01:03:19.453
And you're gonna help us.

01:03:21.555 --> 01:03:23.520
How do we open the Gateway?

01:03:23.522 --> 01:03:26.457
No, no, no, no.
The Queen won't like that.

01:03:26.459 --> 01:03:28.292
Oh, I don't care!

01:03:28.294 --> 01:03:30.229
No!

01:03:30.231 --> 01:03:32.129
Shut him up, or
there's gonna be trouble!

01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:34.432
Don't you wanna
undo all of this?

01:03:34.434 --> 01:03:36.000
Take it back?

01:03:36.002 --> 01:03:37.336
You don't understand.

01:03:37.338 --> 01:03:40.270
The Queen, she's in my head.

01:03:40.272 --> 01:03:41.740
She controls everything.

01:03:41.742 --> 01:03:45.379
You just tell me,
is there a way?

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:51.018
Yes.

01:03:53.586 --> 01:03:57.721
Yes, but she won't be happy.

01:03:57.723 --> 01:04:01.558
No, no, you have to go.
You have to leave, or else!

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.660
Can you do something
about this?

01:04:02.662 --> 01:04:04.765
Yes. I was hoping you'd ask.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.801
Oh, thank you.

01:04:13.841 --> 01:04:17.575
All this time,
what have I done?

01:04:17.577 --> 01:04:19.479
You can shut up now.

01:04:22.649 --> 01:04:24.649
Do you know
where the Gateway is?

01:04:24.651 --> 01:04:26.453
Do you know how to open it?

01:04:28.888 --> 01:04:29.923
You can speak now!

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:35.061
Yes. The power core.

01:04:36.497 --> 01:04:38.665
Do you know how to get it?

01:04:42.468 --> 01:04:44.200
Then go get it!

01:04:44.202 --> 01:04:46.539
And don't get caught.

01:04:50.877 --> 01:04:53.877
Go!

01:04:53.879 --> 01:04:56.383
- Excuse me.
- Quickly, quietly.

01:05:02.156 --> 01:05:03.220
Oh!

01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:19.473
Go! Go!

01:05:32.919 --> 01:05:34.019
Hatter!

01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:38.557
Hatter!
Open this door at once!

01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:40.825
How do I know you're you?

01:05:40.827 --> 01:05:43.729
How do I know you're you?

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:47.732
If I'm not me,
then who would I be?

01:05:47.734 --> 01:05:49.968
Hatter, we don't
have time for riddles.

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:52.604
If you believe me,
I'll believe you.

01:05:52.606 --> 01:05:54.508
Is that a bargain?

01:05:56.575 --> 01:05:58.144
Fair enough.

01:06:09.055 --> 01:06:10.488
Have a nice visit?

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:11.656
I'm afraid not.

01:06:11.658 --> 01:06:13.591
Is it tea time yet?

01:06:13.593 --> 01:06:15.026
The wedding's nearly upon us.

01:06:15.028 --> 01:06:16.861
And I think it's time
I had a spot.

01:06:16.863 --> 01:06:19.865
No.

01:06:19.867 --> 01:06:21.635
Done.

01:06:31.879 --> 01:06:33.611
Oh, gosh...

01:06:35.582 --> 01:06:37.314
I had a cup of tea earlier,

01:06:37.316 --> 01:06:39.584
and I didn't
get too far ahead.

01:06:39.586 --> 01:06:42.220
The future then.
Fear not, Hatter.

01:06:42.222 --> 01:06:44.622
Surely, we're not too late
to correct it.

01:06:44.624 --> 01:06:46.290
I should hope not.

01:06:46.292 --> 01:06:47.859
How does it work?

01:06:47.861 --> 01:06:49.727
I need to find out where and

01:06:49.729 --> 01:06:51.694
when the Avengers wound up.

01:06:51.696 --> 01:06:53.397
You just take a sip

01:06:53.399 --> 01:06:55.866
and you think of when you want
to be in there, you will go.

01:06:55.868 --> 01:06:57.602
Splendid.
A cuppa then.

01:06:57.604 --> 01:07:01.207
Oh, wait.
I got it. Please have a seat.

01:07:02.341 --> 01:07:03.741
This is very strong stuff.

01:07:03.743 --> 01:07:06.678
Well, let's hope so.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.080
- Wish me luck.
- Yes.

01:07:09.082 --> 01:07:12.986
The future, it is, then.
Ever forward, as they say.

01:07:15.888 --> 01:07:19.559
Mm, mm.

01:07:39.479 --> 01:07:41.548
I told you.

01:07:44.051 --> 01:07:46.049
Oh, my!

01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:49.256
It seems we've let
ourselves go, Alice.

01:07:57.664 --> 01:08:00.700
What have they done to
my beautiful building?

01:08:09.443 --> 01:08:11.144
Hello?

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:19.451
Alice?

01:08:19.453 --> 01:08:21.986
Is that you?

01:08:21.988 --> 01:08:24.956
My dear Prince Charming.

01:08:24.957 --> 01:08:29.626
Forgive my saying so,
but you've aged terribly!

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:33.098
You're back, Alice.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.367
Magda has my ring.

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:39.170
Then I've arrived too late.

01:08:39.171 --> 01:08:41.304
That's just it.

01:08:41.305 --> 01:08:44.144
You're right on time.

01:08:45.477 --> 01:08:47.245
He's taking too long!

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:48.345
Time for Plan B?

01:08:48.346 --> 01:08:49.680
My magic will wear off soon!

01:08:49.682 --> 01:08:52.683
Oh, thank you.

01:08:52.685 --> 01:08:54.352
What about him?

01:08:54.354 --> 01:08:55.819
What about him?
Leave him!

01:08:55.821 --> 01:08:57.854
We could kill him.

01:08:57.857 --> 01:09:02.127
Let him suffer here for
as long as here exists.

01:09:07.332 --> 01:09:10.634
Rumpelstiltskin!

01:09:10.636 --> 01:09:13.403
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

01:09:13.404 --> 01:09:14.705
Come here at once!

01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:16.310
Coming, my Queen!

01:09:28.421 --> 01:09:29.821
Rupert, you're alive!

01:09:29.823 --> 01:09:33.258
Are you here to set me free?

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.992
It's about that.

01:09:34.993 --> 01:09:39.130
Sorry, Chuckie.
Magda's got Snow White.

01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:44.234
The only way to get her outta
here is to get you to the altar.

01:09:44.236 --> 01:09:48.839
Congrats, buddy.
You're getting hitched.

01:09:48.841 --> 01:09:51.274
I don't understand.

01:09:51.276 --> 01:09:52.510
If I marry Magda...

01:09:52.511 --> 01:09:55.679
Oh, not Magda!
Snow White.

01:09:55.681 --> 01:09:58.383
But how?

01:09:58.385 --> 01:09:59.683
What about your friend, Alice?

01:09:59.685 --> 01:10:01.018
Forget about Alice.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.854
She's already played her part.

01:10:03.856 --> 01:10:08.826
Trust me, you just need
to walk down the aisle.

01:10:08.828 --> 01:10:11.629
It'll all fall into place.

01:10:11.631 --> 01:10:13.898
Can you hang in there, buddy?

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.033
Of course, yes!

01:10:16.035 --> 01:10:17.167
Anything!

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:19.903
Good.
Now I gotta go.

01:10:19.905 --> 01:10:22.109
I got a part to play, too.

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:26.647
You're a good friend,
Rupert...

01:10:28.848 --> 01:10:30.182
And a hero.

01:10:31.985 --> 01:10:33.820
Anything for love.

01:10:34.988 --> 01:10:37.289
Now it's show time.

01:10:46.165 --> 01:10:49.302
Just gotta get into costume.

01:11:04.449 --> 01:11:07.385
All right.
Coordinates are calibrated.

01:11:07.387 --> 01:11:09.787
Everything is set
as far as I can surmise.

01:11:09.789 --> 01:11:11.488
We just need the power core

01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:12.723
and then we ought to be able
to send the girls back

01:11:12.725 --> 01:11:14.261
just before the wedding.

01:11:16.596 --> 01:11:17.728
Then fire it up.

01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:19.996
Oh, that was careless!

01:11:19.998 --> 01:11:21.099
I thought you were nuts.

01:11:21.101 --> 01:11:23.099
Never proved any harm before.

01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:25.536
In fact, I think it's quite
the asset more oft than not.

01:11:25.538 --> 01:11:27.205
Well, what do you think?
Can you send us back?

01:11:27.207 --> 01:11:29.139
Oh, yes, but with
hardly time to spare.

01:11:29.141 --> 01:11:32.910
We just need to let it
warm up, as it were.

01:11:32.912 --> 01:11:35.979
Ladies? Take your places.

01:11:35.981 --> 01:11:38.950
- Snow...
- Charles?

01:11:38.952 --> 01:11:41.818
I never thought
I'd see you again.

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.821
Now that you have
to leave so soon,

01:11:43.823 --> 01:11:46.990
I...
I don't think I can bear it.

01:11:46.992 --> 01:11:51.062
Charles, I promise you.

01:11:51.064 --> 01:11:54.398
When we're finished, we'll
never have to live this life

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.304
because you'll have lived
a better one with me.

01:12:01.473 --> 01:12:03.176
Give it a shot!

01:12:08.647 --> 01:12:09.882
Oh!

01:12:14.587 --> 01:12:17.022
Oh, did you not mean me?

01:12:19.592 --> 01:12:21.425
Magda!

01:12:21.427 --> 01:12:24.765
Stop right there!

01:12:27.632 --> 01:12:30.468
When my little Rumpy here
told me what you made him do,

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:34.139
well, I thought I'd just
kill you, but...

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.673
Oh!

01:12:35.675 --> 01:12:38.009
This is much more fun.

01:12:38.011 --> 01:12:40.143
I told you we should
have killed him!

01:12:40.145 --> 01:12:42.278
It's what I would have done.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.917
In fact...

01:12:45.452 --> 01:12:47.186
Oh!

01:12:48.587 --> 01:12:53.691
But, my Queen, why?

01:12:53.693 --> 01:12:55.928
I got bored.

01:12:57.931 --> 01:13:00.031
And now I have new playthings.

01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:04.033
Oh, the fun we could have.

01:13:04.035 --> 01:13:06.737
Shall I make you
kill your friends here?

01:13:06.739 --> 01:13:10.608
No. Too easy.

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.411
Perhaps I will let you
use the Gateway.

01:13:13.413 --> 01:13:16.580
The Ice Age sounds nice.

01:13:16.582 --> 01:13:21.984
I'm sure you would feel right at
home there, wouldn't you, Snow?

01:13:21.986 --> 01:13:23.787
Listen to yourself.

01:13:23.789 --> 01:13:25.790
Look around you!

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.992
Is this what you wanted?

01:13:27.994 --> 01:13:30.294
A crumbling kingdom?

01:13:30.296 --> 01:13:34.032
Nothing but brainwashed
subjects to do your bidding?

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:36.834
They don't follow
you out of love.

01:13:36.836 --> 01:13:39.804
You didn't earn any of this!

01:13:39.806 --> 01:13:42.572
Oh, but I did.

01:13:42.574 --> 01:13:46.777
The sheer lengths I went through
in capturing your Charming.

01:13:46.779 --> 01:13:49.447
The long and agonizing years

01:13:49.449 --> 01:13:53.416
I spent twisting him
this way and that.

01:13:53.418 --> 01:13:59.967
Oh, no, this... this has been
a long time coming.

01:14:00.793 --> 01:14:06.863
And now, now I have
everything I've ever wanted.

01:14:06.865 --> 01:14:09.634
But are you happy?

01:14:09.636 --> 01:14:12.036
I'm about to be.

01:14:12.038 --> 01:14:14.272
You had your chance
to be a hero

01:14:14.274 --> 01:14:17.808
and you chose villainy.

01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:20.647
Now you've got another chance.

01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:25.483
I really can't believe it.

01:14:25.485 --> 01:14:29.118
After all this time,
you show up now,

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.721
when you have no chance
of stopping me.

01:14:33.124 --> 01:14:37.694
Oh, I wish Charles
were here to see this.

01:14:37.696 --> 01:14:40.630
Be careful what you
wish for, Magda.

01:14:40.632 --> 01:14:42.499
Charles?

01:14:42.501 --> 01:14:47.871
Oh, Charles, how long has
it been since the wedding?

01:14:47.873 --> 01:14:50.407
Too long.

01:14:50.409 --> 01:14:54.144
Your reign of terror ends today.

01:14:54.146 --> 01:14:57.148
I know I can't tell
you what to do.

01:14:57.150 --> 01:14:59.750
But I would really rather
not kill an old man.

01:14:59.752 --> 01:15:03.787
I'd rather die than
stomach another day with you.

01:15:03.789 --> 01:15:05.257
If you say so.

01:15:06.993 --> 01:15:09.693
Now, Rupert!

01:15:09.695 --> 01:15:10.727
No!

01:15:13.966 --> 01:15:17.268
Send... them... back!

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:19.439
Goodbye, Charles.

01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:26.713
No!

01:15:36.288 --> 01:15:39.590
Charles, you made it.

01:15:39.592 --> 01:15:42.193
And you look so handsome.

01:15:42.195 --> 01:15:46.095
What now?
We say our vows?

01:15:46.097 --> 01:15:48.068
Something like that.

01:15:57.510 --> 01:16:01.644
Be a good Prince,
and marry me...

01:16:01.646 --> 01:16:03.548
Now.

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:06.986
Or I vow...

01:16:09.154 --> 01:16:10.689
To kill her.

01:16:22.569 --> 01:16:23.600
Oh, no!

01:16:23.602 --> 01:16:28.205
Oh! Thank heavens!

01:16:28.207 --> 01:16:30.640
Did you find them?

01:16:30.642 --> 01:16:32.544
Yes and no.

01:16:37.283 --> 01:16:39.183
What now, then?

01:16:39.185 --> 01:16:44.089
Well, I've got
a wedding to crash.

01:16:47.993 --> 01:16:49.794
Motivate him!

01:16:49.796 --> 01:16:50.995
Wait!

01:16:50.997 --> 01:16:54.264
Wait! Wait!

01:16:54.266 --> 01:16:57.835
If I marry you,

01:16:57.837 --> 01:17:00.004
promise to let her live.

01:17:00.006 --> 01:17:02.508
If you're a good boy.

01:17:21.961 --> 01:17:23.195
Snowy!

01:17:26.199 --> 01:17:27.798
Snowy.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.268
Get your scaly ass
away from my man!

01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:33.105
Kill them!

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.241
You don't deserve him!

01:17:37.243 --> 01:17:39.646
"Fairest in all the land"!

01:17:55.327 --> 01:17:57.230
He's marrying me!

01:18:02.068 --> 01:18:05.268
Come on, Chuck, now!
Do it now!

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:07.574
Chuck? Snowy.

01:18:12.477 --> 01:18:15.778
It's me, Charles!
We have to hurry!

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:18.784
Don't listen to her!
That's Rumpelstiltskin!

01:18:20.453 --> 01:18:22.622
Oh, for the love of...

01:18:26.359 --> 01:18:29.827
Snowy... Rupert?

01:18:29.829 --> 01:18:31.728
Oh, now, Chuckie,
I can explain.

01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:33.466
It's kind of funny.
I don't...

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:50.147
You're getting better at this!

01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:51.885
Well, practice
makes perfect!

01:19:01.593 --> 01:19:02.628
Snow?

01:19:06.798 --> 01:19:08.898
Will you marry me?

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.336
It's about time.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.442
Get away from him!

01:19:33.626 --> 01:19:34.825
No!

01:19:34.827 --> 01:19:37.262
If I can't have you,
no one can!

01:19:41.365 --> 01:19:43.032
Stronger than you look!

01:19:43.034 --> 01:19:44.300
Fight me or die!

01:19:44.302 --> 01:19:45.671
I can't hit a woman!

01:19:47.539 --> 01:19:49.242
I can.

01:19:53.412 --> 01:19:57.516
Destroy the city!
Leave nothing standing!

01:20:30.449 --> 01:20:32.515
Mermen are drying up,
fish face.

01:20:32.517 --> 01:20:34.218
If I were you, I'd quit.

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:37.624
Now get the hell off my land!

01:21:17.797 --> 01:21:19.996
You lied to me.

01:21:19.998 --> 01:21:21.730
Magda...

01:21:21.732 --> 01:21:24.367
You were trying to get him
to marry you all along.

01:21:24.369 --> 01:21:26.737
You tried to trick him!

01:21:26.739 --> 01:21:30.474
Magda, no, that's ridiculous.

01:21:30.476 --> 01:21:33.542
You tried to trick me.

01:21:33.544 --> 01:21:35.645
You ruined my wedding!

01:21:35.647 --> 01:21:38.148
No! They ruined your wedding!

01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:40.082
I was just here to help.

01:21:40.084 --> 01:21:41.917
What was it you said
you wanted again?

01:21:41.919 --> 01:21:43.687
Oh, you know what?
I'm good.

01:21:43.689 --> 01:21:45.221
Let's just call it even.

01:21:45.223 --> 01:21:47.758
That's right.
Atlantis.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.028
I'll bring you to Atlantis,
but just be warned.

01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:55.700
Once you see it,
you may never want to leave.

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:56.899
No!

01:21:56.901 --> 01:22:00.603
Come along, men.
Time to go home.

01:22:00.605 --> 01:22:02.339
No, no, no, please!

01:22:02.341 --> 01:22:04.541
No, I beg you!
No! I can't swim!

01:22:05.543 --> 01:22:06.943
No, Magda! No!

01:22:06.945 --> 01:22:09.478
Please let me go!
Let me just stay here!

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.584
Please!
I hate the ocean!

01:22:19.324 --> 01:22:21.627
You may kiss the bride.

01:22:31.337 --> 01:22:33.406
Yeah, that's never
gonna happen.

01:22:34.707 --> 01:22:36.642
I still don't see it.

01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:39.410
Lovely ceremony.

01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:42.511
But after battling
an army of Mermen,

01:22:42.513 --> 01:22:44.148
chasing you through time

01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:46.483
and living through
my own future death,

01:22:46.485 --> 01:22:49.652
I've had just about
enough of the ocean.

01:22:49.654 --> 01:22:52.755
I'll never eat seafood again.

01:22:52.757 --> 01:22:54.992
So what now?
Are you gonna send us back?

01:22:54.994 --> 01:22:59.162
Well, I don't suppose you have
to do anything I say, do you?

01:22:59.164 --> 01:23:01.432
What with ruling all the land.

01:23:01.434 --> 01:23:03.466
I know that's not
how it works here.

01:23:03.468 --> 01:23:06.170
You don't have to worry about me
trying to take over the world.

01:23:06.172 --> 01:23:07.970
Of course not.

01:23:07.972 --> 01:23:09.973
It's already yours,
if I understand correctly.

01:23:09.975 --> 01:23:13.277
Trust me.
We don't see it that way.

01:23:13.279 --> 01:23:14.777
Splendid.

01:23:14.779 --> 01:23:16.580
I think our adventure days
are over.

01:23:16.582 --> 01:23:18.014
Oh, tsk.

01:23:18.016 --> 01:23:20.584
Let's not be so certain
of that, Charles.

01:23:20.586 --> 01:23:22.719
After all, the sea
isn't the only place

01:23:22.721 --> 01:23:24.755
where hidden dangers lurk.

01:23:24.757 --> 01:23:28.191
Believe you me, there's a
whole universe of wonder

01:23:28.193 --> 01:23:31.227
waiting to seep through
the cracks of reality.

01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:33.663
And no doubt we've got quite
a mess to clean up after

01:23:33.665 --> 01:23:37.233
all that pesky time
travel business.

01:23:37.235 --> 01:23:38.902
- We?
- Oh, yes!

01:23:38.904 --> 01:23:42.475
Let's not forget who caused this
mess in the first place, hmm?

01:23:43.609 --> 01:23:46.443
It would only be polite
to help clean it up.

01:23:46.445 --> 01:23:48.178
If you're going
to stick around,

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:51.281
we'll need to make our little
alliance a tad more official.

01:23:51.283 --> 01:23:56.187
So enjoy the honeymoon.
You certainly earned it.

01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:59.089
But when you return,
I'll expect you

01:23:59.091 --> 01:24:02.829
to report promptly to
Looking Glass, all of you.

01:24:05.897 --> 01:24:09.500
If you call, we'll be there.

01:24:09.502 --> 01:24:10.700
Splendid.

01:24:10.702 --> 01:24:11.867
I've a number of matters

01:24:11.869 --> 01:24:13.194
that I'm sure will require

01:24:13.196 --> 01:24:15.532
the attention of
the Avengers Grimm.
