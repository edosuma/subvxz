00:05.697 --> 00:11.533
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

00:13.417 --> 00:16.409
That creature is us.

00:18.017 --> 00:24.411
All over the world we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

00:24.457 --> 00:29.292
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

00:31.297 --> 00:34.573
This is the Human Planet.

00:48.577 --> 00:55.847
The jungle is nature at its most vigorous,
complex and mysterious.

00:58.137 --> 01:00.287
It may appear bountiful,

01:00.337 --> 01:04.489
but for humans, this is a surprisingly
hostile environment.

01:17.257 --> 01:22.615
Though, through history,
great civilisations have arisen here,

01:22.657 --> 01:25.729
none have stood the test of time.

01:33.497 --> 01:37.126
The jungle refuses to be tamed

01:37.177 --> 01:40.886
and it punishes those
who don't live by its laws.

01:46.297 --> 01:50.085
Yet even today, there are some
who guard the secrets

01:50.137 --> 01:52.492
of surviving in this wild world.

01:52.537 --> 01:55.449
These are the remarkable stories

01:55.497 --> 01:59.331
of the people who call
the rainforest home.

02:27.177 --> 02:32.171
Tropical rainforests coverjust
2% of the planet's surface...

02:33.417 --> 02:37.854
...but they're home to half
of all species on Earth.

02:39.737 --> 02:44.492
The problem is, much of this life
is in the tree-tops,

02:44.537 --> 02:47.290
a world way out of our reach.

02:55.817 --> 03:00.971
Exploiting the canopy's riches from
the forest floor is so challenging,

03:01.017 --> 03:04.168
getting enough protein
is a daily struggle.

03:16.417 --> 03:20.729
The Matis of Brazil
are highly skilled hunters

03:20.777 --> 03:25.214
but for the past week there's been
barely enough meat to go round.

03:29.337 --> 03:34.855
Benin is hungry and he's determined
today's hunt will be more successful.

03:42.217 --> 03:47.814
Administering tree-frog toxin into
his bloodstream purges his body,

03:47.857 --> 03:50.052
preparing it for action.

04:06.657 --> 04:10.855
The Matis also drop a noxious
plant juice into their eyes

04:10.897 --> 04:15.209
to sharpen their senses
and focus their minds on the hunt.

04:30.457 --> 04:33.529
Benin and the others summon
the power of the animal spirits.

04:42.257 --> 04:45.374
Hunting canopy animals
from the ground

04:45.417 --> 04:48.807
requires formidable fire power...

04:51.697 --> 04:54.336
...a four-metre long blowpipe,

04:54.377 --> 04:58.495
precision-made to a design
honed over thousands of years.

05:16.257 --> 05:20.648
Spotting animals in the dense
vegetation is so hard,

05:20.697 --> 05:24.326
the Matis rely on hearing
to locate prey...

05:32.177 --> 05:36.375
...and use mimicry to lure them
into range.

05:37.657 --> 05:43.095
They can imitate all ten species of
monkey found in these forests.

05:57.897 --> 06:00.047
A howler monkey responds.

06:04.577 --> 06:08.695
30 metres up,
monkeys are feeding in a fig tree.

06:17.057 --> 06:19.935
Scoring the darts with piranha teeth

06:19.977 --> 06:24.493
ensures the poisoned tip breaks off
in the victim's body.

06:28.817 --> 06:32.207
Unlike guns, blowpipes are near silent

06:32.257 --> 06:34.930
and can be fired
without spooking the monkeys.

06:39.337 --> 06:43.296
Benin makes the first hit,
and now the monkeys scatter.

06:47.217 --> 06:49.890
Once shot, the monkeys
must be tracked

06:49.937 --> 06:53.088
as the curare-vine poison takes effect.

06:56.057 --> 07:01.336
This monkey's already weak,
but it's hiding, and must be flushed out.

07:04.217 --> 07:06.572
They shoot again.

07:10.137 --> 07:14.813
But it's stuck in a vine now, and
there's no choice but to go and get it.

07:27.337 --> 07:31.171
One down, but it's just the beginning.

07:39.777 --> 07:41.893
As one of the swiftest hunters,

07:41.937 --> 07:45.566
it's Benin's job to pick off
any escaping monkeys.

07:49.577 --> 07:53.650
He shoots another, but misses.

08:04.137 --> 08:07.049
Benin fires again, this time on target.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.806
The monkey finally stops...

08:21.257 --> 08:24.647
...and Benin takes aim one last time.

08:34.457 --> 08:37.654
Eight monkeys. It's been a good day.

08:37.697 --> 08:41.451
But all too often
they return empty-handed.

08:51.297 --> 08:54.175
Hunting in the canopy is so difficult,

08:54.217 --> 08:58.529
people must find most of their food
closer to the ground.

09:00.697 --> 09:04.895
But scratching a living
on the forest floor is hardly any easier.

09:07.737 --> 09:14.085
The complex nature of this mysterious
world is so hard to master,

09:14.137 --> 09:16.605
the lessons have to start early.

09:23.817 --> 09:27.332
Orlando's from the Piaroa tribe
of Venezuela.

09:28.337 --> 09:30.009
He's like any other kid,

09:30.057 --> 09:34.573
only life in the jungle has already
forced him to fend for himself.

09:46.417 --> 09:51.252
But this childhood adventure takes
them deep into the jungle underworld.

09:58.817 --> 10:02.696
As only 2% of sunlight
reaches the forest floor,

10:02.737 --> 10:07.811
surprisingly few plants grow
and this means few animals.

10:12.137 --> 10:15.413
There's less protein here
than in the desert...

10:15.457 --> 10:18.893
and much that is here is poisonous.

10:26.097 --> 10:31.535
Distinguishing dinner from danger
is an essential life skill.

10:39.377 --> 10:44.371
Few creatures have a more sinister
reputation than the one they seek.

11:03.377 --> 11:08.576
The goliath tarantula,
the size of a dinner plate,

11:08.617 --> 11:12.053
the largest spider in the world.

11:17.737 --> 11:20.888
It's hard to imagine
a less appetising meal,

11:20.937 --> 11:24.930
but picky eaters don't last long
in the jungle.

11:30.217 --> 11:33.334
Besides, Orlando says
they're delicious,

11:33.377 --> 11:37.768
and handling dangerous animals
comes with the territory.

11:44.097 --> 11:46.053
From about five years old,

11:46.097 --> 11:49.134
Piaroa children know exactly
where to hunt for spiders...

11:50.657 --> 11:54.775
...and in a couple of hours
can catch enough for a decent meal.

12:03.857 --> 12:07.975
But they have to be careful
of both the huge fangs

12:08.017 --> 12:11.976
and of the hairs they kick
towards any attacker.

12:18.057 --> 12:22.335
If they contact the skin or are inhaled,
they cause a nasty reaction.

12:29.577 --> 12:31.533
Orlando's come off worst.

12:34.097 --> 12:38.056
But growing up in the jungle,
he's used to a little discomfort.

12:45.137 --> 12:49.892
Tarantulas are best served toasted,
like marshmallows.

12:52.017 --> 12:56.329
All the hairs must be singed off
so they don't catch in the throat.

12:57.337 --> 12:59.771
And when they start squeaking,

12:59.817 --> 13:04.129
which is just air escaping from
the joints, they're almost done.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.045
Tarantulas taste a bit like crab

13:18.097 --> 13:22.295
and, with a little seasoning,
they go down a treat.

13:32.017 --> 13:34.577
Orlando's and his friends'survival

13:34.617 --> 13:38.735
depends upon embracing
every opportunity in the forest.

13:50.817 --> 13:55.129
Jungle people rely so heavily
on their surroundings,

13:55.177 --> 13:58.135
they become a natural part
of the forest

13:58.177 --> 14:01.886
and form extraordinary bonds
with nature.

14:12.457 --> 14:17.133
Very few people live more intimately
with animals than the Awa Guaja

14:17.177 --> 14:19.691
of the eastern Amazon.

14:22.897 --> 14:26.685
Nurturing a wide range of creatures
from the forest,

14:26.737 --> 14:30.127
the Awa are obsessive pet keepers.

14:36.377 --> 14:40.928
And there are some animals
they cherish above any others.

14:44.177 --> 14:48.853
Like the Matis, hunting monkeys
is vital to the Awa's survival,

14:48.897 --> 14:51.331
providing nearly half their protein.

14:53.577 --> 14:57.456
But this relationship
provides far more than food.

15:00.697 --> 15:04.929
Emwi not only eats monkeys,
she loves them.

15:30.657 --> 15:35.208
Almost all Awa families
keep a number of monkey pets.

15:36.537 --> 15:40.576
There are eight different species
in the village.

15:40.617 --> 15:44.895
The Awa show extraordinary
tenderness for the little monkeys,

15:44.937 --> 15:48.373
believing they're more human
than animal.

15:52.697 --> 15:58.215
Emwi is a devoted mother,
both to her children and her monkeys.

16:13.137 --> 16:15.935
For Emwi and the other Awa,

16:15.977 --> 16:21.654
breastfeeding monkeys is simply
a natural way to help an orphan in need.

16:31.417 --> 16:35.774
Caring so intimately for an animal
they regularly kill

16:35.817 --> 16:38.012
may appear contradictory,

16:38.057 --> 16:41.527
but the Awa believe for everything
they take from the forest,

16:41.577 --> 16:44.137
they have to give back.

16:53.337 --> 16:57.853
When our lives are so deeply
entwined with animals and plants,

16:57.897 --> 17:01.685
they inevitably become
a great source of inspiration.

17:02.897 --> 17:07.129
Perhaps the most spectacular case
of culture imitating nature

17:07.177 --> 17:10.806
is found amongst the people
of Papua New Guinea.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.410
Deep in the forest,

17:25.457 --> 17:31.532
a male superb bird of paradise struts
his stuff for a rather drab female

17:31.577 --> 17:35.490
but she isn't the only one watching.

17:43.137 --> 17:45.935
Geling is a bird of paradise hunter,

17:45.977 --> 17:49.731
and it's the highly prized feathers
he's after.

18:18.897 --> 18:22.810
These coveted plumes are passed
down through generations

18:22.857 --> 18:26.645
but occasionally damaged ones
need replacing.

18:28.497 --> 18:34.208
Birds of paradise are so hard to hunt,
however, that Geling's enlisted help.

18:38.017 --> 18:44.411
Peke is after the long tail feathers
of the Princess Astrapia,

18:44.457 --> 18:48.370
and he's using fruit to lure them in.

19:13.537 --> 19:16.893
Tomorrow is a big day for Geling.

19:16.937 --> 19:20.373
His clan will be performing
at a Sing Sing,

19:20.417 --> 19:23.614
where his reputation
and the honour of his village

19:23.657 --> 19:27.286
will be judged on the quality
of his feather collection.

19:34.337 --> 19:37.056
Sing Sing events are all about competing

19:37.097 --> 19:39.372
to see who's the best-dressed,

19:39.417 --> 19:42.887
and Geling knows not a plume
can be out of place.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.689
In both birds and humans,

19:57.737 --> 20:01.776
it's the most eye-catching
who gets the most attention,

20:01.817 --> 20:06.015
though Geling might be
overstating his conquests.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.246
The Mount Hagen Sing Sing

20:35.297 --> 20:39.529
is the world's largest jungle-themed
fancy-dress party.

20:42.257 --> 20:45.647
Attended by hundreds of tribes,

20:45.697 --> 20:49.246
it's one of New Guinea's
biggest national events.

20:55.377 --> 21:00.576
Amidst the mayhem, Geling's putting
the finishing touches to his outfit.

21:07.057 --> 21:10.208
In New Guinea, male vanity
is something to flaunt.

21:18.657 --> 21:21.296
Though each clan has its own style...

21:22.697 --> 21:27.134
...almost all wear bird of paradise
feathers as their crowning glory.

21:33.217 --> 21:36.812
In their looks,
and even their courtship dances,

21:36.857 --> 21:41.647
the parallels between man and animal
are unmistakable.

21:46.697 --> 21:49.495
They're birds of a feather.

21:49.537 --> 21:55.646
Both use these precious plumes
to display fitness and beauty.

21:58.497 --> 22:02.695
Taking centre stage,
it's Geling's turn to show off.

22:15.137 --> 22:20.336
This deep connection with birds of
paradise began 40,000 years ago...

22:21.537 --> 22:24.097
...and it shows few signs of fading.

22:27.577 --> 22:29.693
Geling's getting on a bit,

22:29.737 --> 22:34.128
and his female admirers aren't quite
as plentiful as they used to be...

22:36.057 --> 22:39.049
...but he's not going to let that
ruffle his feathers.

22:44.577 --> 22:48.889
The diverse nature of the rainforest
influences the people who live here

22:48.937 --> 22:50.734
in endless ways

22:50.777 --> 22:55.168
and it often leads to
breathtaking results.

22:58.137 --> 23:02.016
For the Bayaka tribe
of Africa's Congo basin,

23:02.057 --> 23:05.606
it's the sounds of the jungle
that most inspire them.

23:34.577 --> 23:37.933
Whether using a river as a drum kit...

23:40.617 --> 23:45.054
...or incorporating animal calls
into their work songs...

23:49.097 --> 23:54.376
...the Bayaka consider music to be
their greatest gift from the forest.

24:05.137 --> 24:11.212
But there's something else found here
that the Bayaka prize just as highly.

24:11.257 --> 24:15.694
So highly they're prepared
to risk their lives for it.

24:19.057 --> 24:22.493
Tete and Mongonje are on the hunt,

24:22.537 --> 24:25.495
but it's not meat they're after.

24:46.297 --> 24:48.367
Honey is liquid gold to the Bayaka,

24:48.417 --> 24:51.773
and they go to extraordinary lengths
to gather it.

24:52.617 --> 24:55.177
Using a special vine,

24:55.217 --> 25:00.814
Tete makes a harness to help him
get to grips with this 40-metre tree.

25:07.817 --> 25:12.607
Climbing like this requires skill,
strength and stamina,

25:12.657 --> 25:15.933
especially in the tropical heat.

25:18.017 --> 25:22.886
While Tete climbs, Mongonje prepares
a bundle of smoking leaves

25:22.937 --> 25:25.292
to help pacify the bees.

25:32.497 --> 25:37.093
An hour's passed and Tete's
making impressive progress.

25:59.577 --> 26:02.489
But he's still got a way to go.

26:10.657 --> 26:15.014
News that honey's been found
has spread quickly,

26:15.057 --> 26:18.333
and Tete's wife and kids
come to watch.

26:29.657 --> 26:33.013
Tete's finally made it
to the crown of the tree

26:33.057 --> 26:37.926
but to go any further he'll have to
leave the security of his vine.

26:59.377 --> 27:04.815
Tete's fully aware how dangerous
honey gathering is,

27:04.857 --> 27:08.532
but the Bayaka believe it's bravery
that makes the man,

27:08.577 --> 27:11.933
and sugar is so scarce in these forests

27:11.977 --> 27:16.334
that honey is the best nutrition
Tete can provide for his family.

27:52.937 --> 27:58.375
40 metres up, and unattached,
Tete can't put a foot wrong.

27:59.937 --> 28:03.168
And now the bees
are beginning to attack.

28:07.737 --> 28:11.252
He's made it to the hive,

28:11.297 --> 28:16.325
but he's got to get at the honey
before being overcome by bees.

28:22.777 --> 28:27.487
The smoke helps,
but Tete's still being stung.

28:36.657 --> 28:40.411
Finally Tete strikes gold.

28:55.297 --> 28:58.414
The first basket goes down
to Tete's family...

29:00.897 --> 29:06.529
...and even thousands of angry bees
can't stop the feast.

29:28.817 --> 29:33.129
Tete takes time to savour his success.

29:33.177 --> 29:37.136
He's done enough to keep
his wife sweet, treat his children

29:37.177 --> 29:39.930
and earn respect from his tribe.

29:55.817 --> 30:02.006
For forest people, simple things
can hold extraordinary value,

30:02.057 --> 30:07.211
but it's the trees themselves that are
most in demand all around the world.

30:17.817 --> 30:23.687
Logging is one of the greatest threats
facing the world's rainforests.

30:23.737 --> 30:28.527
Yet there are a few places where
its effects are far less destructive.

30:32.777 --> 30:36.292
The jungles bordering India and Burma
are harvested

30:36.337 --> 30:39.932
using one of the most forest-friendly
methods of all.

30:39.977 --> 30:43.208
And it involves harnessing the raw power

30:43.257 --> 30:46.169
of the mightiest creature in the jungle.

30:54.937 --> 31:00.409
This is Ramprasad - five-and-a-half tonnes
of bull Asian elephant.

31:02.257 --> 31:05.090
And this is Sumir, his mahout.

31:08.497 --> 31:11.136
Before nightfall, they have to drag
a two-tonne log

31:11.177 --> 31:13.771
three kilometres out of the forest.

31:16.137 --> 31:19.686
Ramprasad is the mightiest elephant
in the camp,

31:19.737 --> 31:24.606
but it's still a mammoth test of
brute strength and communication.

31:27.457 --> 31:32.611
Sumir steers Ramprasad
with over 1 00 different commands.

31:40.097 --> 31:43.931
He can be operated in Hindi,
Assamese

31:43.977 --> 31:47.333
and he even understands
a little English.

31:48.617 --> 31:53.566
And Sumir's pretty fluent
in elephant too.

32:06.457 --> 32:10.006
Unbelievably strong
and surprisingly nimble,

32:10.057 --> 32:14.847
elephants are far superior to
logging machines in this tangled terrain.

32:16.857 --> 32:22.329
And most importantly, the forest
doesn't have to be completely cleared

32:22.377 --> 32:25.414
just to access a few selected trees.

32:47.737 --> 32:50.410
There's no need for expensive spare parts,

32:50.457 --> 32:54.973
and elephants run on 1 00% green fuel.

32:58.897 --> 33:03.846
But, unlike a machine,
Ramprasad has a mind of his own

33:03.897 --> 33:07.094
and must be treated with respect.

33:17.897 --> 33:22.254
It's essential to break elephants in
before they're put to work,

33:22.297 --> 33:25.095
but they're still wild at heart,

33:25.137 --> 33:29.653
and keeping control of such raw might
is a fine balancing act

33:29.697 --> 33:31.449
of command and compassion.

33:45.857 --> 33:50.692
Sumir and Ramprasad make it
to the collection site in good time

33:50.737 --> 33:52.693
and help load the trucks.

33:56.737 --> 33:59.012
Transporting logs to the sawmill

33:59.057 --> 34:02.527
is the only mechanised part
of the entire process.

34:08.737 --> 34:11.809
But they're not out of the woods yet.

34:19.337 --> 34:24.809
Once again, underjungle conditions,
elephants out-perform engines.

34:33.497 --> 34:36.967
Job done, time for a well-earned wash.

34:44.897 --> 34:47.286
The jungles of East India and Burma

34:47.337 --> 34:50.693
form the largest area of rainforest
left in Asia

34:50.737 --> 34:55.527
and provide sanctuary for the last
healthy population of Asian elephants.

35:01.137 --> 35:05.494
Ramprasad and these other elephants
have lost their freedom,

35:05.537 --> 35:09.132
but this way of logging helps secure
the future of their species

35:09.177 --> 35:10.371
and their home.

35:14.857 --> 35:17.576
It's through partnerships with nature

35:17.617 --> 35:22.168
that people manage to live within
the jungle without destroying it.

35:25.857 --> 35:31.534
But in most areas of tropical rainforest,
the picture is not so harmonious.

35:41.457 --> 35:47.214
In just 50 years, half the planet's
tropical forest has been cleared.

35:50.497 --> 35:55.525
As many as 1 00 rainforest species
go extinct every day...

35:57.177 --> 36:00.647
...often before
they've even been discovered.

36:06.377 --> 36:09.335
And it's not just animals and plants.

36:09.377 --> 36:15.486
We're also losing human cultures
that we know almost nothing about.

36:19.377 --> 36:22.210
Even in the 21st century,

36:22.257 --> 36:27.331
there are still people who exist
in isolation from the rest of humanity,

36:27.377 --> 36:30.767
and virtually all live in jungles.

36:34.137 --> 36:39.165
These vast, unexplored forests
are the only places left on Earth

36:39.217 --> 36:42.971
where entire communities
can live undetected.

36:44.337 --> 36:49.092
Brazil is thought to be home
to around 70 isolated tribes,

36:49.137 --> 36:52.209
around two-thirds of the world total.

36:55.297 --> 36:58.050
Jose Carlos Meirelles works for FUNAI,

36:58.097 --> 37:01.885
a government agency that protects
Brazil's indigenous people.

37:02.937 --> 37:06.646
Today he's hoping to encounter
one of these uncontacted tribes.

37:11.897 --> 37:15.412
He needs to get to them
before others do.

37:34.217 --> 37:37.892
Logging and mining
are encroaching on these forests

37:37.937 --> 37:40.167
and there are some who want to deny

37:40.217 --> 37:43.926
that uncontacted tribes
live here at all.

38:03.337 --> 38:06.170
Meirelles needs evidence.

38:06.217 --> 38:08.447
The fight to protect these people

38:08.497 --> 38:12.251
depends upon proving
and publicising their existence.

38:29.137 --> 38:35.007
This is the very first aerial footage
of an uncontacted community.

38:52.737 --> 38:57.606
Very little is known about their
way of life or even their language,

38:57.657 --> 39:01.730
and Meirelles would rather
it stays that way.

39:05.977 --> 39:11.768
He's dedicated 40 years to protecting
isolated tribes from the outside world,

39:11.817 --> 39:15.696
but this isn't as simple
as just leaving them alone.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.449
Using a stabilised zoom lens,

39:39.497 --> 39:42.489
it was possible to film
from a kilometre away,

39:42.537 --> 39:45.210
minimising disturbance.

39:45.257 --> 39:49.489
Meirelles believes the more people
are aware these tribes are here,

39:49.537 --> 39:53.849
the more effective the fight
to preserve their way of life.

40:31.737 --> 40:36.891
Humans have survived here
by becoming part of the forest,

40:36.937 --> 40:38.928
but it's this specialisation

40:38.977 --> 40:43.050
that leaves them so vulnerable
in these changing times.

40:52.577 --> 40:57.571
These people are the guardians of
a wealth of knowledge and skill

40:57.617 --> 41:02.247
that enable humans to forge a life
within the natural world.

41:06.937 --> 41:10.088
And there are very few
whose existence remains

41:10.137 --> 41:13.015
as intimately connected
with the rainforest

41:13.057 --> 41:15.810
as the remote tribes of West Papua.

41:25.817 --> 41:32.416
The Korowai are so adapted to life in
the jungle, they've taken to the trees.

41:37.337 --> 41:40.886
This clan is building a new house...

41:47.457 --> 41:50.051
...but it will be no ordinary one.

41:51.937 --> 41:55.566
All materials must be sourced on site,

41:55.617 --> 42:01.374
and much of the cutting is still done
using stone-age tools.

42:05.057 --> 42:07.810
It's an ambitious project.

42:07.857 --> 42:14.296
The plan is to build their new home
in a tree 35 metres up.

42:18.017 --> 42:21.407
Just as well they've chosen an ironwood,

42:21.457 --> 42:23.891
the strongest tree in the forest.

42:27.137 --> 42:31.130
The first step is to build
a ladder to its crown.

42:41.777 --> 42:46.373
These are the only tribes in the world
who live in tree houses...

42:48.257 --> 42:51.806
...and they do so for a number of reasons.

42:55.297 --> 43:00.974
It's an escape from the floods and
the biting insects on the forest floor.

43:01.017 --> 43:04.134
It offers protection
from enemy attack,

43:04.177 --> 43:08.728
but most of all, it's a display
of theirjungle prowess.

43:10.097 --> 43:15.171
For the Korowai, the higher the house,
the greater the prestige.

43:25.697 --> 43:29.133
The Korowai's skills may be exceptional,

43:29.177 --> 43:32.567
but builders are the same the world over.

43:42.937 --> 43:45.610
As one of the clan's
strongest climbers,

43:45.657 --> 43:49.616
Wayo is the foreman overseeing
the most dangerous jobs.

44:01.937 --> 44:07.648
Thinning the branches keeps the house
from shaking apart in the wind.

44:12.457 --> 44:17.008
A fall would mean certain death,

44:17.057 --> 44:21.289
but teetering in tree-tops
is second nature to the Korowai.

44:40.777 --> 44:46.329
As the house goes up,
more trees come down.

44:53.457 --> 44:56.893
But they have to fall
in the right direction.

45:06.737 --> 45:09.695
Activity on the building site is intense.

45:10.777 --> 45:15.487
The rainy season is fast approaching
and the roof still needs to go on.

45:21.177 --> 45:25.250
Everyone's pulling their weight
to complete on schedule.

45:39.697 --> 45:43.326
The roof is tiled with sago-palm leaves

45:43.377 --> 45:46.972
and rolls of tree bark
make the floor and walls.

46:02.497 --> 46:07.890
In two weeks, with 42 workers,
countless felled trees,

46:07.937 --> 46:13.136
30 bundles of palm leaves, 1 6 rolls
of bark and 5 kilometres of twine,

46:13.177 --> 46:16.533
the new home is complete.

46:19.057 --> 46:21.412
It's time to move in.

46:36.817 --> 46:41.845
As always, modesty dictates
a strict entrance policy.

46:51.217 --> 46:56.086
Everything must be carried up,
even family pets

46:56.137 --> 47:00.449
and it's a long way back down
if you forget something.

47:08.057 --> 47:11.367
The first fire is ceremonially lit,

47:11.417 --> 47:15.456
an interesting way to bless
a wooden tree house,

47:15.497 --> 47:19.376
but health and safety regulations
have yet to reach these parts.

47:27.897 --> 47:30.570
Parents are surprisingly relaxed

47:30.617 --> 47:33.814
as their children explore their limits
in the new home.

48:02.337 --> 48:06.046
Through knowledge, skill and ingenuity

48:06.097 --> 48:10.329
rainforest people
have mastered their environment.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.855
They live in tune with their surroundings

48:15.897 --> 48:19.856
and show it a respect
that's being lost elsewhere.

48:23.457 --> 48:29.896
Their remarkable lives remind us
that we are nothing without nature.

48:53.017 --> 48:55.929
Documenting the Papuan
tree house build

48:55.977 --> 48:59.014
was the most challenging shoot
for the Jungles team.

48:59.057 --> 49:03.494
They came prepared for two weeks
filming in the tree-tops,

49:03.537 --> 49:08.975
but when things went wrong, it was
the Korowai who saved the day.

49:18.977 --> 49:23.971
This shoot took cameraman Gavin
Thurston, researcher Rachael Kinley

49:24.017 --> 49:26.087
and producer Tom Hugh-Jones

49:26.137 --> 49:29.254
to some of the least explored
jungles in the world.

49:29.297 --> 49:32.653
We're about five days into the trip,

49:32.697 --> 49:35.734
we had a safe flight in, we had
a very good welcome committee,

49:35.777 --> 49:39.213
and I believe it's about
a three-day walk from here.

49:42.697 --> 49:44.335
No going back now.

49:46.217 --> 49:49.129
Though local porters
help lighten the load,

49:49.177 --> 49:53.932
trekking through the swampy jungle
proves tougher than expected.

49:56.537 --> 49:59.893
Well, I thought, if he's going in,
we've got to show willing, haven't we?

49:59.937 --> 50:02.371
I was going to come and help,
but I've just fallen in.

50:04.777 --> 50:09.532
But with only two weeks'filming,
they have to push on.

50:10.897 --> 50:15.687
The crew eventually arrive at
Lahayu's village to a warm welcome,

50:15.737 --> 50:17.409
Korowai style.

50:22.697 --> 50:26.167
This is Ninkana, and we are beginning
the five minutes of handshake

50:26.217 --> 50:28.811
that seems to be necessary
when you meet someone.

50:30.017 --> 50:32.406
Then it's time to talk business.

50:42.057 --> 50:46.972
Gavin's already spotted
some local wildlife in unusual places.

50:47.017 --> 50:49.577
This is Nasai,
if I've got his name right.

50:49.617 --> 50:51.130
He's got these amazing, um,

50:51.177 --> 50:53.771
apart from an amazing hornbill...

50:53.817 --> 50:54.932
penis sheath,

50:54.977 --> 50:57.810
he's got these feathers
on the side here.

50:58.857 --> 51:01.610
Yakob. I think that's
the sulphur-crested cockatoo.

51:01.657 --> 51:04.217
Noisy, yeah?

51:04.257 --> 51:05.406
What else?

51:05.457 --> 51:07.607
Mambro.

51:07.657 --> 51:09.534
Pigeon?

51:09.577 --> 51:12.375
And the hornbill?

51:12.417 --> 51:14.089
Pfff...

51:14.137 --> 51:16.651
There we are, so that's
today's nature lesson!

51:17.937 --> 51:22.249
The crew go to inspect the ironwood tree
the Korowai have chosen.

51:23.657 --> 51:26.615
Well, the Korowai
have found a really good tree.

51:26.657 --> 51:29.091
It's probably about 70 feet
up to where they plan

51:29.137 --> 51:32.288
to build the tree house.
It's looking good.

51:32.337 --> 51:37.365
A line is fired into a nearby tree
to rig a camera position

51:37.417 --> 51:40.329
but the rope gets caught.

51:41.297 --> 51:44.334
One of these guys
has just shinned right up there.

51:44.377 --> 51:46.015
It's an unbelievable bit of climbing.

51:46.057 --> 51:48.412
All I can say is, if that was
anybody else up there,

51:48.457 --> 51:51.813
my heart would be in my throat,
but he just looks so at ease.

51:53.377 --> 51:57.848
Problem solved, thanks to the Korowai.

51:57.897 --> 52:02.368
Now the ropes are up,
it's Gavin's turn to impress.

52:02.417 --> 52:04.851
I think these guys are fascinated

52:04.897 --> 52:09.812
by how much paraphernalia
we need to get up a tree.

52:09.857 --> 52:13.088
Especially when I can't do it properly.

52:14.777 --> 52:20.135
The Korowai begin building
at an astonishing rate,

52:20.177 --> 52:23.886
leaving Gavin struggling to keep up.

52:23.937 --> 52:28.567
Just as he gets into the swing of things,
rain stops play.

52:30.217 --> 52:33.289
It's been raining for 1 7 hours solid,
I can't believe it.

52:33.337 --> 52:35.453
When it's this wet
it's not safe for them to climb,

52:35.497 --> 52:36.816
the logs are really slippery.

52:36.857 --> 52:38.927
The water table has risen so much now

52:38.977 --> 52:41.047
we've got standing water everywhere,

52:41.097 --> 52:43.292
and the other detail
you probably don't want to know

52:43.337 --> 52:46.534
is that the long drop too
is completely full.

52:46.577 --> 52:51.970
With work at a standstill,
the crew are invited for a social visit.

52:52.017 --> 52:53.416
It's a childhood dream.

52:53.457 --> 52:57.291
It's one of my first memories -
when I was about six or seven,

52:57.337 --> 52:59.851
building a tree house
about four foot off the ground

52:59.897 --> 53:01.330
in an apple tree in the garden

53:01.377 --> 53:03.845
and here I am coming to film
the world experts.

53:03.897 --> 53:06.775
All Korowai houses
are split into gender zones...

53:08.617 --> 53:13.566
...and, on the women's side,
Rachael's attracting a lot of attention.

53:15.217 --> 53:20.052
They seem to be wanting to get me
to dress a bit like them.

53:21.257 --> 53:24.533
Before long she's going native.

53:28.177 --> 53:30.168
A little more than expected.

53:31.737 --> 53:34.171
With the skirt safely fastened,

53:34.217 --> 53:38.176
all that's left is for her
to lose her trousers.

53:39.657 --> 53:44.173
We've had two hours of bonding
with these people.

53:44.217 --> 53:47.971
It's just been really nice to sit down
and get to know the tribe

53:48.017 --> 53:51.248
and to share some jokes with them,
let them laugh at us

53:51.297 --> 53:54.050
and see a bit of their life.

53:55.137 --> 53:58.925
When the rain stops,
the Korowai get going

53:58.977 --> 54:02.333
but Gavin's being encumbered
by all his gear.

54:03.697 --> 54:09.329
I wonder if anybody's ever filmed
a heart attack on a rope before.

54:09.377 --> 54:15.247
Once at the top of the tree,
Gavin's kit comes into its own.

54:15.297 --> 54:18.209
This is quite a clever device,
called a tree pod.

54:18.257 --> 54:19.406
It's got a couple of spikes

54:19.457 --> 54:22.255
and when you strap it to the tree
you get a really good solid base.

54:22.297 --> 54:24.857
The camera goes on top of there.

54:24.897 --> 54:27.411
The tree they've chosen
to put the tree house in,

54:27.817 --> 54:31.446
turns out it's the tallest tree
for a good few hundred metres.

54:31.497 --> 54:35.410
And one of the things we wanted to do
is be able to see the tree house

54:35.457 --> 54:39.530
in its environment, up in the canopy,
and give a sense of height.

54:39.577 --> 54:42.250
It must be getting on for ten storeys high

54:42.297 --> 54:44.447
and just made out of sticks and rattan.

54:44.497 --> 54:47.853
It's quite an incredible
bit of engineering.

54:47.897 --> 54:50.889
The whole time
they've been building this tree house,

54:50.937 --> 54:53.690
there've just been really scary moments.

54:53.737 --> 54:57.127
Right now there's quite a large tree
they're trying to fell

54:57.177 --> 54:59.611
but they are worried it might fall
towards the tree house

54:59.657 --> 55:00.885
and take out the ladder.

55:00.937 --> 55:02.609
So instead of everybody getting out,

55:02.657 --> 55:06.013
there's three guys with long poles
just pushing it out the way

55:06.057 --> 55:08.366
and they've got two more down here
with a bit of rattan

55:08.417 --> 55:11.648
pulling it, in the hope that
it will go away from the platform,

55:11.697 --> 55:14.450
but if it goes the wrong way,
those three guys are going to die!

55:20.657 --> 55:26.687
Another tree falls. This time
it's a little too close for comfort.

55:26.737 --> 55:31.128
Well, luckily they judged that one right
and it didn't come our way.

55:34.257 --> 55:40.366
The building's near completion, but
Gavin still has to shoot the big reveal.

55:40.417 --> 55:43.056
We've set up a line
from the tree the tree house is in

55:43.097 --> 55:45.452
across to where I was filming
from the tree pod.

55:45.497 --> 55:48.728
We're going to put the cable dolly on
and get a really nice pull back

55:48.777 --> 55:51.450
to reveal the tree house
right up in the canopy.

55:54.537 --> 55:55.890
Please, baby.

55:55.937 --> 55:57.495
It won't go anywhere.

55:57.537 --> 56:00.495
What has happened?

56:00.537 --> 56:02.175
It's died!

56:03.177 --> 56:06.010
For the first time ever.

56:07.057 --> 56:09.855
Oh!

56:11.097 --> 56:15.136
Yet again the Korowai
come to the rescue.

56:17.097 --> 56:19.611
Traditional Korowai craftsmanship,

56:19.657 --> 56:24.014
a stick with another little bit of stick
tied on the end.

56:24.057 --> 56:25.331
Come on, baby!

56:27.017 --> 56:30.805
Gavin retrieves the camera dolly
in time for supper.

56:32.257 --> 56:37.490
Food supplies are running low
so the Korowai serve up a local delicacy.

56:37.537 --> 56:38.526
Sago grubs.

56:38.577 --> 56:43.697
They're basically giant beetle grubs
that live inside the sago palms.

56:43.737 --> 56:45.375
And they are a delicacy.

56:45.417 --> 56:49.126
The crunch at the end when you chew
their teeth perhaps isn't the best.

56:49.177 --> 56:51.532
But other than that
they are all right.

56:51.577 --> 56:54.455
You kept saying
you wanted protein.

56:55.977 --> 56:57.376
He's gagging!

56:57.417 --> 57:01.092
I think they taste like caviar.
It's got that pop in your mouth.

57:01.137 --> 57:02.536
- Do you like them?
- Mmmm.

57:02.577 --> 57:06.013
- You can have the rest, then.
- Ah! Thanks. Some more!

57:06.057 --> 57:09.845
The verdict on the sago grubs is,
they are edible

57:09.897 --> 57:12.536
but they are actually
pretty disgusting!

57:12.577 --> 57:14.807
I'm still chewing!

57:16.297 --> 57:20.415
It's the final day and Gavin's last chance
to shoot the grand finale.

57:20.457 --> 57:23.688
Today, it's all come together.
The sun's shining,

57:23.737 --> 57:27.173
the guys are being really helpful
and the cable dolly is behaving itself

57:27.217 --> 57:31.847
and hopefully this is the end shot
for the sequence and the programme.

57:36.417 --> 57:39.693
It's just been incredible
seeing the whole process

57:39.737 --> 57:43.207
of how they build the house
this high up in the canopy.

57:43.257 --> 57:47.045
They all seem to have settled in
very well. Most of them are asleep now.

57:48.737 --> 57:50.887
I'm knackered as well, actually.

57:52.177 --> 57:53.815
Spending time with the Korowai

57:53.857 --> 57:57.532
has given Gavin
a different perspective on life.

57:57.577 --> 58:02.048
I find I judge my own inadequacies
against their expertise and knowledge.

58:02.097 --> 58:05.373
You come here and you've got
boots on in case of snake bites,

58:05.417 --> 58:07.533
you've got sun cream on
because of the sun,

58:07.577 --> 58:10.296
you've got twin safety ropes
to make sure, if one fails,

58:10.337 --> 58:11.770
you are caught on the other one.

58:11.817 --> 58:15.366
And these guys, OK,
maybe they have a higher mortality rate,

58:15.417 --> 58:17.692
but they're much freer
in their lifestyle.

58:17.737 --> 58:20.535
You know, they're shinning
up and down these trees.

58:20.577 --> 58:25.412
I think I'd much rather live a shorter,
fuller life, like they do out here.
