WEBVTT

00:01.087 --> 00:02.917
Previously on "11.22.63"...

00:03.550 --> 00:05.101
Al, why did you show this to me?

00:05.102 --> 00:07.465
I need you to prevent the assassination

00:07.466 --> 00:09.133
of John F. Kennedy.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.184
I wanna save him too. I wanna help.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.291
We need to find out when
Oswald starts talking

00:13.292 --> 00:14.411
about General Walker

00:14.851 --> 00:16.850
and who he starts talking about him to.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.870
Lee is back.

00:18.871 --> 00:20.920
That's George de Mohrenschildt.
He's CIA.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.967
This might be the start
of the whole thing.

00:22.968 --> 00:23.988
General Walker.

00:23.989 --> 00:25.978
I have something to say!

00:25.979 --> 00:27.948
Why come to a little place like Jodie

00:27.949 --> 00:29.988
when there's plenty of
teaching jobs in Dallas?

00:29.989 --> 00:31.828
I didn't really take to the city.

00:31.829 --> 00:33.968
Call me Deke. All my faculty does.

00:33.969 --> 00:35.908
Mr. Amberson, this is Miss Dunhill.

00:35.909 --> 00:37.571
Yeah, we've... we met before.

00:37.572 --> 00:40.888
People in Texas, they're not
exactly welcoming to a divorcée.

00:40.889 --> 00:41.969
To starting over.

01:49.829 --> 01:51.019
Shit.

02:05.568 --> 02:08.038
Come on, come on, come on.

02:10.683 --> 02:12.773
Whoo! All right, let's show 'em.

02:19.753 --> 02:22.773
You are in the Marines now, son.

02:24.803 --> 02:26.903
Let's see it.

02:30.823 --> 02:33.772
Sharp shooter!

02:52.753 --> 02:54.773
Again.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.395
Marina?

03:09.466 --> 03:11.435
Marina!

03:16.416 --> 03:20.335
Oh-ho, Juney, it's...

03:27.356 --> 03:30.505
Oh, baby, it's okay.

03:30.506 --> 03:33.425
I'm... Daddy's coming, I'm...

03:33.426 --> 03:37.396
It's okay.

03:38.416 --> 03:40.355
Hmm.

03:46.436 --> 03:49.415
Mm. English. You are American now.

03:49.416 --> 03:50.455
Marina.

03:50.456 --> 03:51.455
Stand here.

03:51.456 --> 03:55.445
Okay.

03:55.446 --> 03:56.515
Why the papers?

03:56.516 --> 03:58.535
'Cause people will want to know.

03:58.536 --> 04:00.375
That I stand for something.

04:00.376 --> 04:03.336
You look ridiculous.

04:05.638 --> 04:07.637
Lee, what's a man like you

04:07.638 --> 04:09.587
going to do with a rifle like that?

04:09.588 --> 04:10.778
I am going to hunt fascists.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.787
Ready?

04:15.788 --> 04:16.808
Now.

04:32.708 --> 04:37.707
Hey, Bill. I want you to
watch them closely today.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.657
I wanna know everything that goes on

04:39.658 --> 04:41.617
between George and Lee, okay?

04:41.618 --> 04:43.697
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

04:43.698 --> 04:45.667
I like being in this new apartment,

04:45.668 --> 04:48.637
right underneath them.
Makes things a lot easier.

04:48.638 --> 04:52.727
Hey. They still have no idea who we are.

04:52.728 --> 04:54.707
Let's keep it that way.

04:54.708 --> 04:55.707
All right.

04:55.708 --> 04:57.667
- Get me?
- Yeah.

04:57.668 --> 04:59.658
- See you later.
- See you later.

06:17.748 --> 06:19.628
Howdy, stranger.

06:27.618 --> 06:30.758
You know, they say,
"Smart is the new sexy."

06:32.698 --> 06:34.797
I don't know anyone who says that.

06:34.798 --> 06:38.778
Oh. Well... I say it.

06:43.818 --> 06:47.648
Don't worry. Everyone's gone.

06:48.818 --> 06:53.697
Do you know anything... more uplifting?

06:53.698 --> 06:54.817
Not really, I'm just learning.

06:54.818 --> 06:59.667
Oh. How about this?

06:59.668 --> 07:03.797
How could I
dance with another...

07:03.798 --> 07:05.737
Ooh

07:05.738 --> 07:10.667
When I saw you standing there?

07:10.668 --> 07:11.687
That's catchy.

07:11.688 --> 07:13.637
- Yeah.
- You make that up?

07:13.638 --> 07:15.627
Oh, yeah. Just me and my mates,

07:15.628 --> 07:17.627
John, Paul, George, and Ringo.

07:17.628 --> 07:18.717
Your mates?

07:18.718 --> 07:23.687
Umm, yeah,
my imaginary friends.

07:27.678 --> 07:29.677
You're so odd.

07:29.678 --> 07:30.797
Just crazy...

07:30.798 --> 07:32.628
about you.

07:44.638 --> 07:45.707
Mr. Amberson.

07:45.708 --> 07:47.627
Yeah.

07:47.628 --> 07:48.698
You have a moment?

07:54.698 --> 07:57.627
When you take on a
responsibility to teach,

07:57.628 --> 07:59.647
you also take on a responsibility

07:59.648 --> 08:00.727
to set an example.

08:00.728 --> 08:02.677
An example?

08:02.678 --> 08:04.807
Hell, it's harder for girls.

08:04.808 --> 08:07.787
Different rules, you know?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.797
I mean, just take a look around here.

08:09.798 --> 08:13.177
Every pair of eyes you see,
there's two pairs you can't see.

08:13.178 --> 08:15.088
And they're all watching you,

08:15.089 --> 08:18.158
judging you, deciding
if you're good or bad.

08:18.159 --> 08:21.988
Girls here, they all wanna grow
up to be just like Miss Dunhill,

08:21.989 --> 08:23.088
and that's a good thing,

08:23.089 --> 08:25.168
'cause she's important.

08:25.169 --> 08:27.969
She's a new kind of woman.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.008
You care about her?

08:31.009 --> 08:32.018
Yeah.

08:32.019 --> 08:34.087
Then put her first.

08:34.089 --> 08:36.188
Protect what's important in this life.

08:38.129 --> 08:42.129
Discretion is the better
part of valor, young man.

08:45.139 --> 08:46.138
Right.

08:46.139 --> 08:49.048
Jimla-doo.

08:49.049 --> 08:52.029
I need to talk to you about
your defense this year, son.

09:10.979 --> 09:13.068
I'm gonna do something, I swear.

09:13.069 --> 09:15.028
Someone has to.

09:15.029 --> 09:16.029
Make...

09:17.109 --> 09:20.118
Jake, drop that. Listen.

09:20.119 --> 09:21.148
You gotta listen to this.

09:21.149 --> 09:23.138
Here. Listen.

09:23.139 --> 09:27.038
The... the fabric of society
is being torn apart

09:27.039 --> 09:29.078
by people like General Walker.

09:29.079 --> 09:31.068
We have seen before, haven't we?

09:31.069 --> 09:33.188
Men of power, grabbing
whatever they want.

09:33.189 --> 09:35.128
Thank God they're speaking English.

09:35.129 --> 09:38.008
I'm gonna do something, I swear.

09:38.009 --> 09:39.978
Someone has to.

09:39.979 --> 09:42.138
Make... make a-a statement.

09:42.139 --> 09:43.968
You got a new rifle.

09:46.029 --> 09:47.958
Send a message.

09:47.959 --> 09:51.118
An action that cannot be ignored.

09:51.119 --> 09:55.188
I'm gonna. I tell ya, I've got it in me.

09:55.189 --> 09:58.128
You have courage.

09:58.129 --> 10:01.158
And I have some friends.

10:01.159 --> 10:03.958
Powerful friends who can...

10:03.959 --> 10:08.028
help you be the great man
you... you want to be.

10:08.029 --> 10:10.118
I'm happy to introduce you.

10:10.119 --> 10:13.968
Marina, don't slam...

10:13.969 --> 10:16.958
This... this changes everything.

10:16.959 --> 10:18.128
What do you mean?

10:18.129 --> 10:21.958
George just told Lee to
assassinate General Walker.

10:21.959 --> 10:24.178
And he said he'd introduce
him to his friends...

10:24.179 --> 10:27.018
at the CIA.

10:27.019 --> 10:29.138
George is a handler for Lee.

10:29.139 --> 10:32.028
George is the gun. Lee's the bullet.

10:32.029 --> 10:33.168
CIA's pulling the trigger.

10:33.169 --> 10:37.968
And Walker is a test run for Kennedy.

10:37.969 --> 10:39.118
But you said he misses Walker.

10:39.119 --> 10:40.988
Then why would the CIA
stick with the shooter

10:40.989 --> 10:42.168
that misses the target?

10:42.169 --> 10:44.078
I don't know, I don't know.

10:44.079 --> 10:46.988
Maybe Lee's part of the
conspiracy right now,

10:46.989 --> 10:48.138
and he messes up, they cut him loose,

10:48.139 --> 10:50.068
but he goes rogue on Kennedy.
I don't know.

10:50.069 --> 10:52.059
So... What do we do now?

10:54.784 --> 10:56.815
We got to follow them both, okay?

10:56.816 --> 10:58.568
You take Lee. I'll cover George.

10:58.569 --> 10:59.793
- No, you take Lee.
- No, no, no.

10:59.794 --> 11:00.953
- I'll take George.
- No, you take Lee.

11:00.954 --> 11:03.743
I don't want Lee. All he
ever does is read books.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.823
Then he'll be easy.

11:05.824 --> 11:07.824
Close it up, close it up, close it up.

11:07.825 --> 11:08.844
All right, all right, all right.

11:08.845 --> 11:11.775
Close it up! Come on!

11:18.825 --> 11:22.874
Oh, Miss Mimi.

11:22.875 --> 11:26.873
How long did you think you'd get
away with it, Mr. Amberson?

11:26.874 --> 11:28.805
Or should I call you Mr. Epping?

11:39.825 --> 11:41.815
Thank you.

11:46.785 --> 11:47.865
Oh.

11:49.845 --> 11:52.914
Bill, I respect your
interest in my visit,

11:52.915 --> 11:55.874
but I think this matter
is best handled privately

11:55.875 --> 11:57.955
between myself and your brother.

12:07.805 --> 12:11.784
So, um, how did you find me in Dallas?

12:11.785 --> 12:13.864
You're not hard to follow.

12:13.865 --> 12:17.744
We never received your
immunization records.

12:17.745 --> 12:20.884
State school board requires
those for employment.

12:20.885 --> 12:23.764
Yours don't exist.

12:23.765 --> 12:26.864
I investigated your degree and
found out it was issued by

12:26.865 --> 12:30.814
what generously might be
referred to as a "mill,"

12:30.815 --> 12:33.874
and a call to your last
known address in Kentucky

12:33.875 --> 12:37.764
revealed that you use the name
Epping when it suits you.

12:37.765 --> 12:39.895
Okay, all right, I got it.

12:42.785 --> 12:44.934
I haven't taken this to Mr. Simmons.

12:44.935 --> 12:48.834
I came to you because
I believe in trust.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.945
You wouldn't break our trust, would you?

12:57.925 --> 12:59.924
No.

12:59.925 --> 13:04.784
I wouldn't.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.944
You're right, I haven't
been telling the truth.

13:07.945 --> 13:10.835
Well, not all of it.

13:13.735 --> 13:18.744
My real name is Jake Epping.

13:18.745 --> 13:23.784
I was given the name Amberson

13:23.785 --> 13:25.884
by the FBI

13:25.885 --> 13:29.834
when I went into witness protection.

13:29.835 --> 13:31.754
Witness protection?

13:31.755 --> 13:36.844
Yes, in 1959, I turned
over state's evidence

13:36.845 --> 13:40.834
for a case against the Mafia.

13:40.835 --> 13:42.754
What is the Mafia?

13:42.755 --> 13:43.844
The Mafia.

13:43.845 --> 13:47.774
Italian-American organized
crime syndicate.

13:47.775 --> 13:48.925
What did you witness?

13:54.825 --> 13:56.745
Well...

13:58.745 --> 14:02.904
I had this friend, Fredo,

14:02.905 --> 14:06.864
and his brother Michael

14:06.865 --> 14:09.794
had him killed on a fishing trip

14:09.795 --> 14:11.874
in Lake Tahoe.

14:11.875 --> 14:13.844
In return for my testimony,

14:13.845 --> 14:15.964
the FBI gave me a new identity.

14:15.965 --> 14:18.924
They set me up in Jodie,

14:18.925 --> 14:21.804
a place nobody would ever look for me.

14:21.805 --> 14:24.964
And Bill and I just keep
this place as a backup.

14:24.965 --> 14:30.735
You know, just in case they
try to pull me back in.

14:34.825 --> 14:36.795
I see.

14:39.785 --> 14:42.934
If you were revealed to be
an imposter in the school,

14:42.935 --> 14:45.894
it would devastate this community.

14:45.895 --> 14:48.734
Yeah.

14:48.735 --> 14:50.834
I won't say anything about it.

14:50.835 --> 14:53.815
Thank you.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.755
It's wrong to conceal things
from those you care for.

15:03.845 --> 15:06.764
What... what are you saying?
I-I should tell Sadie?

15:06.765 --> 15:09.924
If I discovered this
about you, anyone can.

15:09.925 --> 15:12.914
When you refuse to tell people
the truth, Mr. Amberson,

15:12.915 --> 15:15.913
you deny them their dignity.

15:15.914 --> 15:20.854
And for some of us, dignity matters.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.924
Hi.

16:41.925 --> 16:43.895
Hi.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.825
Wanna dance?

16:53.775 --> 16:56.934
What's the occasion?

16:56.935 --> 17:00.924
It's Friday.

17:00.925 --> 17:03.775
Yeah, I saw that in the calendar.

17:11.835 --> 17:13.803
I don't wanna move too fast.

17:13.804 --> 17:16.964
Oh, no.

17:16.964 --> 17:20.874
I know, I-I...

17:20.875 --> 17:23.874
Maybe I overdid it, but, um,

17:23.875 --> 17:25.795
I've just been thinking...

17:27.905 --> 17:29.895
I care about you.

17:32.895 --> 17:35.894
Care about you too.

17:35.895 --> 17:39.854
And I realized that

17:39.855 --> 17:42.834
being with me may be
costing you something

17:42.835 --> 17:44.845
more than it should.

17:47.765 --> 17:50.764
People talk.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.823
So I thought,

17:53.824 --> 17:57.824
if we could just have a place,

17:57.825 --> 18:01.874
just a moment, where...

18:01.875 --> 18:05.734
we could be our real selves.

18:05.735 --> 18:07.844
How's that sound?

18:07.845 --> 18:09.824
A bit dramatic.

18:09.825 --> 18:10.944
Yeah.

18:10.945 --> 18:13.944
All I really want

18:13.945 --> 18:17.925
is just to be right here with you.

18:21.955 --> 18:26.814
But if this is all, you know, too much,

18:26.815 --> 18:30.834
I-I, um, I-I totally understand.

18:30.835 --> 18:34.873
I did bring that record
player all the way from home,

18:34.874 --> 18:36.954
and it's really heavy.

18:36.955 --> 18:39.794
And that is one of my favorite songs.

18:39.795 --> 18:43.894
I guess I just, um...

18:43.895 --> 18:46.824
I don't... know a lot about you.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.904
I just wanna get to know you.

18:48.905 --> 18:50.895
Like, what's your middle name?

18:53.905 --> 18:54.945
Laurel.

18:56.775 --> 18:58.904
Laurel.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.755
My middle name's George.

19:17.915 --> 19:19.834
Hey.

19:19.835 --> 19:22.873
Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.

19:22.874 --> 19:25.794
I just... I found this.

19:25.795 --> 19:28.824
I seen your baby girl
with it a couple times.

19:28.825 --> 19:30.775
Thought she might be missing it.

19:31.905 --> 19:35.884
I'm Bill. From downstairs.

19:35.885 --> 19:37.944
Yes. Bill.

19:37.945 --> 19:39.854
I'm Marina.

19:39.855 --> 19:42.775
Real
nice to meet you, Marina.

19:44.795 --> 19:48.834
Thank you, Bill. For doll.

19:48.835 --> 19:51.825
June, she has... not so many.

20:07.895 --> 20:08.935
Hey.

20:16.945 --> 20:19.933
You look different when you sleep.

20:19.934 --> 20:21.914
What's wrong?

20:21.915 --> 20:25.814
Nothin'.

20:25.815 --> 20:28.794
Tell me.

20:28.795 --> 20:32.914
How come you never tell
stories about your life?

20:32.915 --> 20:37.944
About your family, about
you and Bill growing up.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.864
You want family stories, I
can give you family stories.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.855
That's not my point.

20:53.785 --> 20:57.744
You got something to hide?

20:57.745 --> 21:00.924
I don't wanna hide anything from you.

21:00.925 --> 21:02.834
Good.

21:02.835 --> 21:05.815
I want us to be honest with each other.

21:08.965 --> 21:11.825
I just don't know if I can be.

21:15.965 --> 21:20.884
Sometimes people hide things
inside because they're afraid...

21:20.885 --> 21:23.894
that if they share them with others...

21:23.895 --> 21:28.784
It's gonna ruin everything?

21:28.785 --> 21:33.934
Is that what you're afraid of?

21:33.935 --> 21:38.924
I feel like I'm an
imposter in my own life.

21:38.925 --> 21:42.834
Everyone thinks I'm one thing,

21:42.835 --> 21:47.904
but I'm something else.

21:47.905 --> 21:49.885
I don't wanna be that way.

21:52.915 --> 21:56.884
I wanna...

21:56.885 --> 21:58.955
wanna start things over right now.

22:01.865 --> 22:03.865
Here, with you, in this room.

22:05.735 --> 22:06.855
This is what I wanna build on.

22:09.865 --> 22:11.815
Never look back.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.885
Okay?

22:15.945 --> 22:17.795
Okay.

22:22.855 --> 22:25.764
All right, I'm gonna tell you something

22:25.765 --> 22:27.745
that's gonna sound really crazy.

22:34.965 --> 22:37.764
What?

22:37.765 --> 22:39.935
Was that envelope there
when we got here?

22:44.865 --> 22:45.945
I don't know.

23:01.745 --> 23:02.883
What's the matter?

23:02.884 --> 23:04.825
It's just the hotel bill.

23:06.805 --> 23:08.774
You know what, I...

23:08.775 --> 23:12.804
forgot I have to do something with Bill.

23:12.805 --> 23:13.914
We... we'd have to go.

23:13.915 --> 23:14.914
We're leaving?

23:14.915 --> 23:17.754
I'm really sorry.

23:17.755 --> 23:18.955
I'm sorry. We... we've just gotta go.

23:21.895 --> 23:24.884
- The CIA?
- Yes.

23:24.885 --> 23:26.784
We're getting close.

23:26.785 --> 23:28.814
This is them telling us to back off.

23:28.815 --> 23:30.913
If the CIA are worried about us,

23:30.914 --> 23:33.754
why don't they just kill
us with a blow dart

23:33.755 --> 23:35.814
- or rat poison or something?
- This is a specific message.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.754
They're saying not only
they're gonna ruin me,

23:37.755 --> 23:38.934
they're gonna ruin Sadie too.

23:38.935 --> 23:40.924
It's collateral damage.

23:40.925 --> 23:42.844
So break up with Sadie.

23:42.845 --> 23:44.854
- What?
- Break up with Sadie.

23:44.855 --> 23:46.824
Leave... leave Sadie out of this.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.814
I didn't get Sadie into this.

23:48.815 --> 23:50.784
All I'm saying is

23:50.785 --> 23:52.763
we gotta double down, all right?

23:52.764 --> 23:56.854
We need to clear up all this
shit with Lee and George. Now.

23:56.855 --> 23:58.824
- You wanna solve it?
- Yeah.

23:58.825 --> 24:00.744
Shoot Lee.

24:00.745 --> 24:01.944
I'm not convinced that it's Lee alone.

24:01.945 --> 24:03.954
But this says we're getting close.

24:03.955 --> 24:07.754
We're getting close to them,
and they don't like it.

24:07.755 --> 24:09.965
Just need to get a little bit more.

24:16.875 --> 24:19.824
George, I don't wanna do this.
Okay, let's just go home.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.804
Be quiet. If they sense something's up,

24:21.805 --> 24:23.744
they won't let us in.

24:23.745 --> 24:26.873
- Yes?
- Candy bar.

24:26.874 --> 24:28.795
- Come on in.
- Voilà.

24:29.865 --> 24:31.834
All right, look.

24:31.835 --> 24:33.734
George said that he was
gonna introduce Lee

24:33.735 --> 24:34.834
to his powerful friends.

24:34.835 --> 24:35.954
This might be the meet.

24:35.955 --> 24:37.774
I don't like this.

24:37.775 --> 24:38.794
- Just come on.
- At all!

24:38.795 --> 24:40.864
Come on, Bill.

24:40.865 --> 24:42.784
We've gotta get close
enough to hear them

24:42.785 --> 24:43.954
without them seeing us.

24:43.955 --> 24:48.813
Gotta hear the plan go
from the CIA to Lee.

24:48.814 --> 24:50.904
- Yes?
- Candy bar.

24:50.905 --> 24:52.774
Come on in.

24:52.775 --> 24:54.744
- All right.
- This isn't gonna work.

24:54.745 --> 24:56.874
Well, if you're staying out
here, then you wait in the car,

24:56.875 --> 24:58.865
with the other babies.

25:11.925 --> 25:13.834
Wow.

25:13.835 --> 25:14.914
All right, come on,
we've gotta find Lee.

25:14.915 --> 25:17.794
Come on, Bill.

25:22.835 --> 25:23.913
Hey, hey, hey.

25:23.914 --> 25:25.944
Bill, Bill, Bill.

25:25.945 --> 25:27.954
- He's out cattin' around.
- I know, calm down, just...

25:27.955 --> 25:29.824
Welcome to the Shamrock Hotel.

25:29.825 --> 25:31.734
Oh, hi. Hello.

25:31.735 --> 25:32.884
Let me get y'all a drink
and introduce you

25:32.885 --> 25:34.854
to the finer things in life.
What do you say?

25:34.855 --> 25:35.884
That sounds great.

25:35.885 --> 25:37.914
Oh, attaboy.

25:37.915 --> 25:41.764
Now, this is a high-class place.
Don't you worry.

25:41.765 --> 25:43.764
We even got them Michelobs
in the fancy little bottles.

25:43.765 --> 25:45.783
Great, we'll take two of
those please, thank you.

25:45.784 --> 25:48.784
Oh, I like you, son. What's your name?

25:48.785 --> 25:50.874
- I'm George.
- And your friend?

25:50.875 --> 25:52.804
- Uh, this here's Wayne.
- Bill.

25:52.805 --> 25:53.854
Billy Wayne.

25:55.845 --> 25:58.934
Hey, I really appreciate
the hospitality, but, uh,

25:58.935 --> 26:00.964
not to be rude... I'm ready to go,

26:00.965 --> 26:02.944
if you know what I'm saying!
Ha-ha! All right.

26:02.945 --> 26:04.794
Oh, believe me, I understand.
Time is money.

26:04.795 --> 26:06.844
- Yeah.
- Y'all see anything you like?

26:06.845 --> 26:11.955
Um, well, uh, yeah. Uh...
she looks great.

26:14.805 --> 26:18.784
Dawn, got a live one.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.754
Hi, hi.

26:20.755 --> 26:22.754
- Hello, mister.
- Howdy.

26:22.755 --> 26:23.834
And what about you?

26:23.835 --> 26:25.744
Uh, he's broke.

26:25.745 --> 26:27.834
What? No, that's not true.

26:27.835 --> 26:28.944
Yeah, he's broke; he's gonna
wait for me right there.

26:28.945 --> 26:31.825
- Come on, baby.
- Bye!

26:32.845 --> 26:34.964
I'm not broke.

26:34.965 --> 26:37.904
- I can do it.
- Okay, hurry, I'm ready.

26:37.905 --> 26:39.913
Okay, we're hustling.

26:39.914 --> 26:42.924
Tell you what, Thursday
night's a full moon.

26:42.925 --> 26:45.934
It's like crocodiles eatin'
chickens around here,

26:45.935 --> 26:48.834
all feathers and bones and shit.

26:48.835 --> 26:51.915
Hey, Sally, fix your lipstick.

26:53.945 --> 26:57.964
Just so's you know, it's
15 dollars for 15 minutes.

26:57.965 --> 27:01.754
Half an hour's gonna run you at 25.

27:01.755 --> 27:03.824
And you don't look like
you've got an hour in you,

27:03.825 --> 27:05.864
so I won't bother.

27:05.865 --> 27:08.954
And I don't do nothin' standing up,

27:08.955 --> 27:11.935
account of my bad leg.

27:26.875 --> 27:27.953
You comin'?

27:27.954 --> 27:31.794
Um, you know, I'm not gonna...

27:31.795 --> 27:32.834
You're not gonna what?

27:32.835 --> 27:34.744
Not gonna... I don't need you.

27:34.745 --> 27:35.764
Mm, nah, nah, nah, nah,
you ain't one of those.

27:35.765 --> 27:36.914
We don't allow that.

27:36.915 --> 27:38.784
- It's okay.
- No no, that ain't your party.

27:38.785 --> 27:41.794
I know, I know, that's not what I mean.

27:41.795 --> 27:42.794
That... that... no! Agh!

27:42.795 --> 27:44.754
You okay?

27:44.755 --> 27:47.754
- You sorry sons-a-bitch!
- What? Quiet!

27:47.755 --> 27:49.783
Shh! Shh! Quiet!

27:49.784 --> 27:51.854
Shh, shh!

27:51.855 --> 27:53.854
Police! Freeze, this is a raid.

27:53.855 --> 27:55.875
Fuck! Fuck!

28:00.965 --> 28:03.864
Whoa, boy. Where you
going in such a hurry?

28:03.865 --> 28:04.935
Shit.

28:18.815 --> 28:20.754
I didn't see Lee or George in there.

28:20.755 --> 28:21.934
Yeah, well, George knows people.

28:21.935 --> 28:24.814
There's no way he ends up
in a goddamn drunk tank.

28:24.815 --> 28:27.944
Solicitation of a prostitute?

28:27.945 --> 28:30.823
Maybe I had you figured wrong, Jake.

28:30.824 --> 28:32.804
Bill, I can understand, but you...

28:32.805 --> 28:34.824
What?

28:34.825 --> 28:36.814
- Deke.
- Don't bother, son.

28:36.815 --> 28:37.834
I don't wanna hear it.

28:37.835 --> 28:39.864
I know it's a lot to ask,

28:39.865 --> 28:41.954
but maybe we could keep this between us?

28:41.955 --> 28:44.795
You understand what I mean?

29:05.745 --> 29:06.884
All right.

29:06.885 --> 29:08.964
Hold on a minute. You're
not going anywhere.

29:08.965 --> 29:10.944
What do you mean?

29:10.945 --> 29:13.803
You've got a class in 30
minutes, and I don't have a sub.

29:13.804 --> 29:15.894
- Can I change my shirt?
- Nope.

29:15.895 --> 29:17.874
- Deke.
- You about to get a lesson

29:17.875 --> 29:19.844
in reaping what you sow.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.925
Close the door, Bill.

29:45.865 --> 29:46.954
Good morning, Miss Mimi.

29:46.955 --> 29:49.773
Good morning, Mr. Simmons, sir.

29:49.774 --> 29:51.784
Well, I believe it might
be time for us to look at

29:51.785 --> 29:53.824
that summer school schedule.

30:11.895 --> 30:14.944
Morning, Miss Mimi.

30:14.945 --> 30:16.844
Mr. Amberson.

30:16.845 --> 30:18.774
Perhaps you'd like to
review the dress code

30:18.775 --> 30:19.824
in the teachers' manual.

30:19.825 --> 30:22.744
- No, I just...
- You just what?

30:22.745 --> 30:25.934
I just need a tie and a belt.
Can you help me? I...

30:25.935 --> 30:26.964
I'll see what I can do.

30:26.965 --> 30:28.875
Thank you.

30:34.765 --> 30:36.875
Coffee.

30:43.865 --> 30:45.854
Miss Mimi, who is that?

30:45.855 --> 30:47.744
That is Mr. Clayton.

30:47.745 --> 30:49.734
Sadie's ex?

30:49.735 --> 30:50.844
What's he doing here?

30:50.845 --> 30:53.815
Mr. Amberson, that is
none of your business.

31:26.815 --> 31:31.784
Sadie? Sadie!

31:31.785 --> 31:34.874
It's from the leather shop.
You'll have to do without a tie.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.925
Okay. Thank you.

31:45.785 --> 31:46.934
I can't do this right now.

31:46.935 --> 31:48.813
Sadie.

31:48.814 --> 31:50.884
No, I-I don't wanna do this right now.

31:50.885 --> 31:53.784
Wait, wait, wait.

31:53.785 --> 31:57.834
What? Just talk to me.

31:57.835 --> 32:00.904
He's not gonna give me the divorce.

32:00.905 --> 32:02.964
All right.

32:02.965 --> 32:04.944
I thought it was gonna
be different here.

32:04.945 --> 32:06.924
But he found me.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.884
So he's not gonna let it happen.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.924
How did he find you?

32:11.925 --> 32:14.874
My mother told him.

32:14.875 --> 32:17.863
Why are you so upset?

32:17.864 --> 32:20.814
Well, you remember...

32:20.815 --> 32:22.764
when you said everyone has something

32:22.765 --> 32:23.944
they're afraid to share?

32:23.945 --> 32:26.944
Yeah, but there's nothing
that you could share...

32:26.945 --> 32:29.864
You don't understand.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.924
Then tell me.

32:31.925 --> 32:34.935
It will be okay.

32:36.925 --> 32:40.905
I promise. It'll be fine.

32:45.825 --> 32:47.744
When I met Johnny, I thought he was

32:47.745 --> 32:50.905
the most charming man I'd ever met.

32:52.775 --> 32:54.923
We'd never done much...

32:54.924 --> 32:57.774
physically.

32:57.775 --> 33:00.925
I just thought he was old-fashioned.

33:02.825 --> 33:05.864
On our wedding night, he, uh...

33:05.865 --> 33:07.944
he got real tense.

33:07.945 --> 33:10.804
Didn't wanna kiss me.

33:10.805 --> 33:13.864
He just asked me to close my eyes.

33:13.865 --> 33:17.734
So I did.

33:17.735 --> 33:20.874
And then he took my hand,

33:20.875 --> 33:22.955
and he put it on himself.

33:25.895 --> 33:29.804
And I screamed.

33:29.805 --> 33:31.875
Why?

33:40.745 --> 33:43.805
'Cause he had a clothespin on him.

33:45.745 --> 33:47.815
What?

33:49.855 --> 33:52.904
I didn't know what to say, so I laughed.

33:52.905 --> 33:54.924
And then he hit me.

33:54.925 --> 33:58.905
So I started crying,
and he hit me again.

34:00.955 --> 34:04.935
And then he put his hand over my
mouth and he got on top of me.

34:06.915 --> 34:10.784
When he was done, he said,

34:10.784 --> 34:15.764
"Go wash your wormy hole. You're dirty."

34:16.895 --> 34:18.853
Why didn't you leave him?

34:18.855 --> 34:20.793
Well, I tried to tell my mother,

34:20.795 --> 34:22.773
but she said it's a wife's duty

34:22.774 --> 34:24.873
to take care of her husband.

34:24.875 --> 34:28.924
And so I did.

34:28.925 --> 34:32.793
I never should have told you.

34:32.795 --> 34:34.853
You think I'm disgusting.

34:34.855 --> 34:38.844
What? No. No.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.744
- Sadie, no.
- I ruined it.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.844
No.

34:42.844 --> 34:44.955
- Sadie! God...
- I ruin everything

35:10.825 --> 35:11.963
Bill? What are you doing here?

35:11.964 --> 35:13.864
George came by the house.

35:13.865 --> 35:15.764
Keep your voice down.

35:15.765 --> 35:17.884
He wanted Lee to come with him at 4:00.

35:17.885 --> 35:20.754
He said his two friends
wanted to meet today.

35:20.755 --> 35:21.884
Had to meet today.

35:21.885 --> 35:23.734
Lee wasn't having any of it.

35:23.735 --> 35:24.944
He was still pissed
off about last night.

35:24.945 --> 35:27.784
He said he's got something he has to do.

35:27.785 --> 35:29.844
Why aren't you with him right now?

35:29.845 --> 35:31.914
'Cause he went to sleep. He
works the swing shift, later.

35:31.915 --> 35:34.733
- Okay.
- Let's go.

35:34.734 --> 35:36.955
You follow Lee. I'll follow George.

35:45.755 --> 35:46.905
Shit.

35:58.925 --> 36:00.875
Come on, lady.

36:02.965 --> 36:05.914
Shit.

36:05.915 --> 36:09.835
Hiding in plain sight.
Typical CIA front.

36:10.875 --> 36:12.934
Come on.

36:12.935 --> 36:14.805
Where are you?

36:53.895 --> 36:55.944
I don't wanna fight, baby.

36:55.945 --> 36:59.753
Look, I got you something.

36:59.754 --> 37:00.934
Wait...

37:00.935 --> 37:03.914
It's the only photo of the
three of us together.

37:03.915 --> 37:05.834
It's just, you know,

37:05.835 --> 37:09.834
I-I had it framed for you.

37:09.835 --> 37:13.934
If something happens to me,
I want Juney to have it.

37:13.935 --> 37:15.914
To remember her papa by.

37:15.915 --> 37:19.764
What do you mean, if something happens?

37:19.765 --> 37:21.794
There is something important
that I have to do.

37:21.795 --> 37:24.944
I can't tell you what it
is, but it's a good thing.

37:30.755 --> 37:31.883
It's okay.

37:31.884 --> 37:35.874
It'll be okay. Shh.

38:04.935 --> 38:06.955
Fucking hell, Jesus Christ.

38:36.935 --> 38:38.894
You said he'd be here.

38:38.895 --> 38:40.814
- I know.
- Well, where is he then?

38:42.734 --> 38:47.734
He's hard to handle. I'm doing my best.

38:47.735 --> 38:48.854
General Walker, as we discussed.

38:53.855 --> 38:54.934
Shh.

39:08.815 --> 39:11.915
They are filthy animals, aren't they?

39:21.885 --> 39:24.874
Now, I don't think that we
have been formally introduced.

39:24.875 --> 39:27.954
Johnny Clayton.

39:27.955 --> 39:29.944
I'm Sadie's husband.

39:29.945 --> 39:32.774
Did you follow me?

39:32.775 --> 39:35.833
Well, I wanted to talk.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.874
Make sure that you got my message.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.804
- What message?
- The photographs...

39:39.805 --> 39:42.854
of you and my wife.

39:42.855 --> 39:43.934
That was you?

39:43.935 --> 39:48.864
Mr. Amberson, you've been bad.

39:48.865 --> 39:52.744
And you need to... you need to
understand what's at stake.

39:52.745 --> 39:53.904
You have no fucking idea.

39:53.905 --> 39:55.934
Oh...

39:55.935 --> 39:58.954
Let's try to handle
this without profanity.

39:58.955 --> 39:59.954
- Fuck you.
- Oh.

39:59.955 --> 40:01.853
- Okay?
- Okay.

40:01.854 --> 40:03.784
You ever talk to Sadie,
or go near her again,

40:03.785 --> 40:06.944
I will kick the shit out of
you and leave you in a ditch.

40:06.945 --> 40:09.795
You get my message?

40:10.815 --> 40:13.735
Sadie is my wife.

40:14.955 --> 40:17.804
She belongs to me.

40:17.805 --> 40:19.914
Now, if you try to breach
that bond, then...

40:19.915 --> 40:22.864
Then there will be consequences.

40:22.865 --> 40:23.904
For the both of you.

40:23.905 --> 40:26.824
How's your clothespin?

40:26.825 --> 40:28.795
What, are you wearing it right now?

40:29.905 --> 40:31.753
You live in a small town.

40:31.754 --> 40:33.844
People love to talk.

40:33.845 --> 40:34.904
Now what do you think they'll say

40:34.905 --> 40:39.744
once they learn your sad little secrets?

40:39.745 --> 40:41.744
Did your daddy put that on you?

40:41.745 --> 40:43.794
Oh, no, that was your mommy.

40:43.795 --> 40:44.794
No.

40:47.835 --> 40:50.824
She... she shouldn't have...

40:50.825 --> 40:52.764
Shouldn't have told you that.

40:52.765 --> 40:54.814
Give her the divorce,

40:54.815 --> 40:56.933
and then crawl back under your rock,

40:56.934 --> 40:59.845
you sorry sack of shit.

41:17.755 --> 41:19.915
You two deserve each other.

42:18.735 --> 42:19.885
Hi.

42:21.785 --> 42:22.905
Hi.

42:25.785 --> 42:26.885
These are for you.

42:34.905 --> 42:37.934
People... people wanna think that

42:37.935 --> 42:39.964
that's what life is like, that

42:39.965 --> 42:42.755
it's flowers and hearts.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.835
But it's not.

42:47.845 --> 42:49.815
It's messy.

42:50.855 --> 42:51.955
Things get broken.

42:56.905 --> 42:59.784
I don't want you here 'cause
you feel sorry for me.

42:59.785 --> 43:00.965
That's not why I'm here.

43:03.815 --> 43:06.795
I'm here because I love
everything about you.

43:10.765 --> 43:13.774
No matter what happened to you,

43:13.775 --> 43:16.914
or what will happen to you,

43:16.915 --> 43:20.864
it's not all bad.

43:20.865 --> 43:23.905
Because the person standing
in front of me is a wonder.

43:28.885 --> 43:31.785
You are a wonder.

44:10.755 --> 44:12.753
Bill?

44:12.754 --> 44:13.835
What going on?

44:17.945 --> 44:20.804
There's two hours of Russian
bullshit on that tape

44:20.805 --> 44:23.854
if you wanna catch up.

44:23.855 --> 44:27.744
Me, I'm done.

44:30.955 --> 44:32.784
- Lee, stop!
- All right, that's it.

44:32.785 --> 44:33.874
- That son of a bitch.
- Please stop!

44:33.875 --> 44:35.844
You can't, no, no, no.

44:35.845 --> 44:37.883
I swear to God, I'm gonna punch
you in the fucking throat.

44:37.884 --> 44:39.774
You can't get involved in their lives.

44:39.775 --> 44:40.874
You can't interfere.

44:40.875 --> 44:41.924
Listen to what he's doing to her.

44:41.925 --> 44:43.774
He's hurting her.

44:43.775 --> 44:44.834
- She lives!
- It's all about you.

44:44.835 --> 44:45.964
Get the fuck out of my way.

44:45.965 --> 44:48.844
You can't! You can't. I'm sorry.

44:48.845 --> 44:51.755
Okay? I'm sorry.

44:53.845 --> 44:57.745
Listen. Listen, listen.

44:58.795 --> 45:01.935
It stopped. It stopped.

45:03.885 --> 45:05.925
You're a fucking asshole.

45:26.855 --> 45:28.875
Hey.

45:31.845 --> 45:33.894
Smoke?

45:33.895 --> 45:35.875
Lee not like.

45:37.915 --> 45:40.775
I won't tell.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.814
Morning, Deke.

46:32.815 --> 46:34.794
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

46:34.795 --> 46:37.824
- Hey, where's Mimi?
- Out sick.

46:37.825 --> 46:39.775
And watch yourself. It's Miz Mimi.

46:40.925 --> 46:42.853
What's wrong with him?

46:42.854 --> 46:46.794
I don't know.

46:46.795 --> 46:48.765
What is it?

46:50.775 --> 46:53.764
He did it.

46:53.765 --> 46:55.844
I don't know why, but he did.

46:55.845 --> 46:57.814
That's great.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.745
We should go celebrate.

47:00.945 --> 47:02.905
I can't believe it.

47:11.735 --> 47:12.945
- Sadie?
- Hmm?

47:20.845 --> 47:23.754
Me too.

47:23.755 --> 47:26.733
See you later.

47:26.734 --> 47:27.955
Okay.

47:54.775 --> 47:56.864
That's it. That's it.

47:56.865 --> 48:01.784
Go! Gah, yeah! Come on!

48:01.785 --> 48:04.965
Agh! Whoo!

48:10.785 --> 48:12.784
Hey.

48:12.785 --> 48:14.884
Did you win?

48:14.885 --> 48:15.954
Yeah.

48:15.955 --> 48:18.744
I used Al's book.

48:18.745 --> 48:19.925
It's all right. It's for both of us.

48:21.865 --> 48:23.803
Look,

48:23.804 --> 48:26.904
the thing with Marina...

48:26.905 --> 48:28.804
I'm sorry.

48:28.805 --> 48:29.914
Mm.

48:29.915 --> 48:34.784
What we're doing is a
crazy, crazy thing.

48:34.785 --> 48:36.744
And I can see there is no way

48:36.745 --> 48:38.755
I would ever be able
to do it without you.

48:42.925 --> 48:44.854
We're a team.

48:44.855 --> 48:45.934
Yeah.

48:45.935 --> 48:48.734
We're a team.

48:48.735 --> 48:49.954
Okay?

48:49.955 --> 48:51.963
All right.

48:51.964 --> 48:54.774
I got to get back to Jodie.
You gonna be all right?

48:54.775 --> 48:57.944
Sure, I got some plans for the winnings.

48:57.945 --> 49:00.795
Yeah? Hope you're not going
back to the Shamrock Hotel.

49:05.805 --> 49:06.885
No!

49:08.835 --> 49:10.885
Okay.

49:31.865 --> 49:34.845
Jake?

49:45.775 --> 49:46.935
Jake, are you here?

50:14.805 --> 50:16.755
Bill, is that you?

50:19.775 --> 50:21.875
Jake?

52:08.765 --> 52:11.785
Who are you?
