12:40.240 --> 12:41.800
Give him a reward.

Oh, I like it in silver, too.

[Tourist's wife]
I'll have that other bracelet--

13:04.520 --> 13:06.560
[indistinct speech]

13:06.560 --> 13:10.160
I'm sorry, sir, but I couldn't
possibly take your money.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.160
Please enjoy your time
on the island.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.000
Thanks, kid.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.240

13:51.640 --> 13:53.320
$100.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.320
Excuse me?

13:57.320 --> 13:58.440
I said--

13:58.440 --> 14:00.600
[grunts]

14:00.600 --> 14:02.320
$100.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.800
$100 for what?

14:03.800 --> 14:05.440
Well, I you wanna go
on a fishing trip,

14:05.440 --> 14:07.440
it's $100 an hour.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.960
I supply reels for fly-fishing,

14:08.960 --> 14:10.760
but you bring your own rig
for big game,

14:10.760 --> 14:13.200
and there is no smoking
and no drinking on the boat.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.320
[chuckles]

14:14.320 --> 14:16.800
Well, I don't drink or smoke.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.960
Or fish.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.760
Well, then what are you doing
on my boat?

14:19.760 --> 14:21.920
I'm lookin'
for Jonah Coleridge.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.520
Oh, well, that's a coincidence!

14:23.520 --> 14:25.920
I'm looking at someone
who is trespassing on my boat

14:25.920 --> 14:28.600
on a private deck.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.240
My name is Desaray Rolle.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.640
I work for the Freeport
Social Services Department.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.200
[grunting]

14:35.200 --> 14:37.640
And I was led to understand
that there was a Jonah Coleridge

14:37.640 --> 14:38.760
who lived here
with his granddaughter.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.360
Excuse me!

14:40.360 --> 14:42.840
[grunting]

14:44.200 --> 14:45.640
What happened to Nole?

14:45.640 --> 14:47.840
Uh, Mr. Lewis retired.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.120
They sent me here from Nassau
to take over his cases.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.960
Oh, that's too bad.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.360
I liked Nole.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.720
He couldn't fish worth a fart,
but he was good company.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.680
So am I to assume
that you are Jonah Coleridge?

14:58.680 --> 15:01.320
Well, you may assume
whatever you like.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.240
[grunting]

15:02.240 --> 15:05.240
Personally,
I try to avoid

15:05.240 --> 15:08.280
conclusions before investigation,

15:08.280 --> 15:10.280
but you may do as you wish.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.080
Is that supposed to be clever?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.120
Yes.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.560
Sir, I do not have time
for your games.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.560
Are you or are you not
Jonah Coleridge?

15:16.560 --> 15:17.800
I am.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.800
Then why didn't you say so?

15:20.800 --> 15:23.800
Because I don't like people
snooping around

15:23.800 --> 15:26.840
my home before they have

15:26.840 --> 15:29.280
the courtesy to ask
for an invitation.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.160
I am here to examine

15:32.160 --> 15:34.280
the living situation
of the minor

15:34.280 --> 15:36.120
who is in your care,
Mr. Coleridge.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.440
Oh, I'm not questioning
your career choices, Miss Rolle,

15:38.440 --> 15:39.880
only your manners.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.120
Hmm.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.120
Is this boat yours'
and Annabel's primary place

15:43.120 --> 15:44.120
of residency?

15:44.120 --> 15:45.280
It is.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.560
And where is Annabel?

15:47.560 --> 15:49.720
Well, where would you expect her
to be at this time?

15:49.720 --> 15:50.600
[Desaray]
Hmm.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.680
She's coming home from school.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.000
Okay.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.560
Bye, Megan.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.520
I am Robert M. Carbunkle.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.520
My card.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.920
You're a barista?

17:15.920 --> 17:17.760
That says "barrister".

17:17.760 --> 17:19.120
There's an R at the end.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.160
You don't look like a lawyer.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.400
You look more like a pirate.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.920
I have a suit.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.120
Look can I get up?

17:24.120 --> 17:27.120
I don't feel like lounging
in dead fish.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.000
Just don't try anything funny.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
I assure you the last thing
I'm trying to be is funny.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.960
[grunting]

17:39.960 --> 17:41.360
I am working--

17:41.360 --> 17:43.840
[grunting]

17:43.840 --> 17:45.080
I'm working
for your grandparents

17:45.080 --> 17:46.120
on your mother's side.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.960
Samuel and Sheryl Williams.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.240
I haven't seen them in--

17:49.240 --> 17:50.720
Nearly 10 years.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.720
They hired me
to give this to you.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.720
That letter
will explain everything.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.520
And if you are amenable,

17:58.520 --> 18:00.000
call me on the number
on my card,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.680
then I'll arrange everything.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.720
Good day.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.600
Bye.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.320
So this place is
a research center?

18:15.320 --> 18:17.400
Well, it's a non-profit
marine research

18:17.400 --> 18:19.760
and conservation center.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.840
My son was a marine biologist.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.200
[sighs]

18:23.200 --> 18:26.200
He came out to the island,
fresh out of grad school,

18:26.200 --> 18:28.880
and fell in love with the place.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.880
He founded the center,
and then he ran it by himself,

18:33.560 --> 18:34.920
and Debrah joined him later.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.760
Until they died, 10 years ago?

18:37.760 --> 18:39.920
Yes.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.160
And now, you own it?

18:42.160 --> 18:44.000
Well, in theory, Anna does.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.880
Oh, the staff run the center,

18:46.880 --> 18:48.720
but Anna helps
with the dolphins.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.920
[Jonah]
There's one in particular,
she's very fond of.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.920
Hmm, that's nice.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.200
Well, yes, it is actually.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.480
[Desaray]
And these people--

18:56.480 --> 18:59.480
They live here I assume.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.320
Well, just my son's friends.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.440
Well,
he said they could stay here

19:03.440 --> 19:04.800
and I saw no reason
to change matters.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.240
Your son sounds like
a very interesting person.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.240
He was the best man
I ever knew.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.800
Do you make your living
as a fisherman then?

19:12.800 --> 19:13.920
Yeah.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.360
I also do chartered fishing
and diving tours.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.960
And there's my pension.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.160
Hmm.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.640
Thank you, Mr. Coleridge.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.360
I think
I understand the situation.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.240
What situation is that,
precisely?

19:25.240 --> 19:27.760
It will be in my report.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.480
Do you have problems
expressing your opinions

19:29.480 --> 19:31.960
to peoples' faces, Mrs. Rolle?

19:31.960 --> 19:34.840
Or are you more comfortable
hiding behind reports?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.280
I'm very comfortable

19:36.280 --> 19:39.280
sharing my opinion,
Mr. Coleridge.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.800
Annabel, by all accounts,

19:41.800 --> 19:44.800
is a smart
and hard-working young lady

19:44.800 --> 19:47.800
who has suffered
a terrible tragedy.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.400
And, instead of accepting
your responsibility

19:50.400 --> 19:53.000
to raise her in a safe
and nurturing environment,

19:54.000 --> 19:55.680
you took advantage
of the situation

19:55.680 --> 19:58.440
to retire to a paradise,

19:58.440 --> 20:00.400
play Popeye the Sailor Man
and drink rumrunners

20:00.400 --> 20:03.400
with your friends all day.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.960
You don't know
what you are talking about.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.400
-This is good place to live.
-Hmm.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.640
There are some fine people here.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.920
[Annabel]
Where is grandpa!

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Not now, Mitzy.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.560
Grandpa!

20:15.560 --> 20:18.000
Oh, just wait until I tell you
about my way over--

20:18.000 --> 20:19.520
Uh, oh-- hello.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.520
Hello, you must be Annabel.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.000
Um, Annabel, this is Mrs. Rolle
from Social Services.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.880
She's come here to judge us.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.000
What do you have there, Annabel?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.720
Oh, a letter I got
from a strange man.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.720
Anna, how many times have I told
about talking to strangers?

20:35.720 --> 20:38.320
I only talked to him
after I hit him with an oar.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.440
Did he try and harm you?

20:40.440 --> 20:43.000
Uh, no,
he just took photos of me.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.560
He looked like a pirate,
but he was just a lawyer.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.560
Wait.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.880
Uh,
a lawyer gave you this letter?

20:48.880 --> 20:50.760
Yeah, I thought it was
another bill collector.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.840
Oh you have a lot of
late bills?

20:52.840 --> 20:53.880
[Annabel]
Oh, yes.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.280
That's how
we keep the bourgeois class

20:55.280 --> 20:56.600
at our mercy.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.280
Uh, Mrs. Rolle,
we'll have to finish this later.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.320
Well, actually,

21:02.320 --> 21:04.320
I haven't finished my interview
with Annabel.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.720
No, I must insist.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.040
I'm sorry.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.040
Please, excuse us.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.760
Annabel, I will see you soon.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.600
Oh, okay.

a word

21:47.920 --> 21:49.080

21:49.080 --> 21:51.080
since we held memorial service
for your mum and dad.

Why would they suddenly want
to see us now?

that your grandfather saw

22:01.360 --> 22:02.960
that weasely little city man,

22:02.960 --> 22:04.120
he punched him straight
in the nose.

Uh, Grace.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.560

and you know it.

how things supposed to be.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.920
Now, his wife you know,
she was nice enough,

22:15.920 --> 22:17.000
but that man,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.800
if your granddad hadn't hit him,
I would have.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.800
Trust me.

Grace, I think she's got it now.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.680
Oh, okay, fine.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.400
You don't want me
tellin' the girl,

22:25.400 --> 22:26.840
you won't hear a word about it.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.520

where I'm not wanted.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.600
Ooh.

So what was the arguing about?

22:35.560 --> 22:37.600
Nothing.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.000
Oh, just a disagreement.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.120
It was a very difficult time.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.120
Maybe they wanna make up?

Well, they are my family.

22:54.720 --> 22:55.840
Right.

23:16.760 --> 23:17.520
Keep these comin'.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.640
I had a rough day

23:18.640 --> 23:20.720
and I'm eating my feelings,
obviously.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.320
Okay.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.600
Yeah.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.760
Oh, Mr. Williams, sir.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.600
Yes, sir, I am just
at the office right now

23:33.600 --> 23:35.640
I was just going over
your files here

23:35.640 --> 23:37.480
How was your flight, sir?

23:37.480 --> 23:39.600
Oh,
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.440
Yep, we call that
"island time", sir.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.760
People here uh,
have a different relationship

23:44.760 --> 23:46.200
to time than--

23:46.200 --> 23:47.800
Uh, oh, no, sir.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.920
No, you're absolutely right.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.520
They should have--

23:50.520 --> 23:52.680
Yes, sir, uh, of course.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.240
No, sir-- I mean, yes, sir.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.240
Yes.

23:55.240 --> 23:56.480
No, I've arranged all of that.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.760
We're having lunch with them
at your hotel, sir.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.800
Yes.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.320
And may I just say, sir,
that I really appreciate

24:01.320 --> 24:03.800
the opportunity
to be working uh--

24:03.800 --> 24:05.080
Sir?

24:05.080 --> 24:06.520

24:40.360 --> 24:43.200
Oh, Annabel, look at you.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.360
You're so beautiful.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.240
Samuel,
look at how beautiful she is.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.240
She's a vision, Sheryl.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.320
An absolute vision.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.600
Sheryl.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.400
Sam.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.120
This is Mr. Carbunkle.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.520
Oh, gramps, that's the lawyer.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.680
Ah!

25:02.680 --> 25:04.600
The man you payed
to stalk my granddaughter.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.720
Mr. Carbunkle is
a local barrister.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.680
He was recommended by my firm
in New York

25:08.680 --> 25:10.720
to assist us in this matter.

25:10.720 --> 25:13.240
What is that you want,
Mr. Williams?

25:15.280 --> 25:17.960
[exhales]

25:17.960 --> 25:19.040
Sheryl and I think it's time
to--

25:19.040 --> 25:21.600
Anna, dear, how would you
like

25:21.600 --> 25:23.560
to visit New York?

25:23.560 --> 25:24.400
Really?

25:24.400 --> 25:25.280
Wow, that would be awesome!

25:25.280 --> 25:26.160
[Annabel]
Just--

25:26.160 --> 25:27.280
I can't stay too long.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.840
You know, I have the center uh,
and school--

25:29.840 --> 25:30.880
Mmhmm.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.880
-And Mitzy, of course.
-Uh, who is Mitzy?

25:32.880 --> 25:33.960
She's my best friend.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.120
She's a dolphin.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.000
I can't wait for you
to meet her, grandma.

25:37.000 --> 25:37.880
A dolphin?

25:37.880 --> 25:39.000
How interesting.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.080
The ocean's pork.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.760
I once had dolphin
in St. Vincent.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.440
It was delicious.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.920
Not fishy at all--

25:47.920 --> 25:49.440
You know, Annabel,

25:49.440 --> 25:51.720
you are gonna love
Mr. and Mrs. Williams' townhome

25:51.720 --> 25:52.720
in Manhattan.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.080
Best of the best of everything.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.040
Aren't you a lucky little girl?

25:56.040 --> 25:57.880
I don't understand.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.760
I'd like to speak
to your grandparents, privately.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.920
Gramps.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.760
Now, please.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.320
Okay.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.640
Jonah, we just want to get
to know

26:12.640 --> 26:13.760
our granddaughter.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.920
Fine, then get to know her here.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.480
And watch as you allow her
to waste her life

26:17.480 --> 26:19.200
in this place?

26:19.200 --> 26:20.360
Uh, waste her life.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.480
You mean, like your daughter did
with my son?

26:23.920 --> 26:26.040
Debrah was a grown woman.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.240
There was nothin' I could do
about that.

26:27.240 --> 26:29.640
And there's nothing
you can do about Annabel.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.680
David and Debrah's will
made sure of that.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.960
Mr. Williams' law firm
has filed a motion

26:35.960 --> 26:38.800
to review Annabel's custody

26:38.800 --> 26:41.800
and a local judge has agreed
to a hearing.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.840
You've been served,
Mr. Coleridge.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.680
There's also a check here
for a quite tidy sum.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.520
That is reimbursement
for Annabel's care

26:53.520 --> 26:55.640
over the years.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.280
It's more
than I felt appropriate,

26:57.280 --> 27:00.280
but Mr. Williams
is a very generous man.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.400
Anna will have the best schools

27:02.400 --> 27:05.160
and all the opportunities
we can provide her.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.800
You can come
and visit her anytime you like.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.640
We wouldn't think
of keeping you apart.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.000
You want to buy Annabel.

27:13.000 --> 27:13.960
No, we would nev--

27:13.960 --> 27:15.880
Just like you tried
to buy off David,

27:15.880 --> 27:18.280
because you didn't think he was
good enough for your daughter

27:18.280 --> 27:19.720
and Debrah hated you for it.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.840
My relationship with my daughter
is none of your business!

27:21.840 --> 27:23.840
You haven't changed at all,
have you?

27:25.280 --> 27:28.280
I suggest you be reasonable,
Mr. Coleridge.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.440
Oh, do you suggest that,
Mr. Carbunkle?

27:30.440 --> 27:33.240
Well, I suggest
that you take your check

27:33.240 --> 27:35.440
and you roll it
into a very tight ball

27:35.440 --> 27:36.880
and you shove it directly
into his--

27:50.320 --> 27:52.720
A guy like that,
never listens to reason.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.120
What are our chances
at the hearin'?

27:56.120 --> 27:57.440
About even.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.400
Tell you what though,
money can goes a long way,

27:59.400 --> 28:01.160
if you would just
let me take a pile of it--

28:01.160 --> 28:04.000
No.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.120
I told you
I want this all above board.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.800
This is about what's best
for Annabel.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.720
Nothing else.

28:13.200 --> 28:21.520

28:21.520 --> 28:23.040

28:24.880 --> 28:26.040
Oh, of course.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.800
-Over there.
-Thank you.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.800
Mrs. Rolle, I understand you are
the case worker

28:33.800 --> 28:36.080
for Anna Coleridge.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.040
And you are?

28:42.040 --> 28:43.920
A barrister?

28:43.920 --> 28:45.800
I represent her grandparents.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.840
I was wondering
if I could get a copy

28:47.840 --> 28:50.640
of your report
on Anna's situation?

28:50.640 --> 28:53.240
Oh, I haven't completed
that report.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.520
I haven't interviewed Anna yet.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.920
Oh, I see.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.920
Are there any
preliminary observations

28:59.920 --> 29:01.040
you could share?

29:01.040 --> 29:02.840
[Carbunkle]
Unofficially, of course.

29:02.840 --> 29:03.800
Between you and me,

29:03.800 --> 29:05.800
her grandparents
are very concerned

29:05.800 --> 29:07.520
about Anna's well-being.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.680
I can imagine.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.800
I've had the pleasure
of meeting Mr. Coleridge.

29:10.800 --> 29:11.800

29:11.800 --> 29:12.800
[Carbunkle]
As have I.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.520
And frankly, I'm worried
he isn't thinkin'

29:14.520 --> 29:15.520
about what's best for Anna.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.400
Oh, those kind never do.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.640
Beach bums
on permanent holiday.

29:19.640 --> 29:20.840
Drinkin' all the time.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.840
Can't be relied on

29:21.840 --> 29:23.400
to put a child's needs ahead
of their own.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.880
I've met a lot of men like that.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.520
I was married
to a man like that.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.840
[chuckling]

29:29.840 --> 29:32.680
Well, it'll be completed
in a few days.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.960
That'll be just fine,
Mrs. Rolle.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.520
And thank you very much.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.840

[Carbunkle sighs]

29:51.280 --> 29:54.280
I s-- yes, but if--

29:54.280 --> 29:55.560
Yes, sir.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.320
I agree with you, sir.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.280
Yes.

29:58.280 --> 30:01.000
Let me just say this though,
I--

30:01.000 --> 30:01.920
Yes, sir.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.880
The meeting
did not go as planned,

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
but there were human variables.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.280
And I tell you what,

30:06.280 --> 30:08.400
the one constant that you can
have with human variables,

30:08.400 --> 30:11.000
especially officials, is money

30:11.000 --> 30:13.720
and that-- no, no, sir,
I don't mean to bribe

30:13.720 --> 30:16.400
necessarily, but perhaps
to grease

30:16.400 --> 30:18.280
a few palms, sir.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.320

30:19.320 --> 30:20.160

30:20.160 --> 30:21.720
Mr. Williams?

30:21.720 --> 30:22.760
Unbelievable!

30:22.760 --> 30:24.000
He did it again.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.440
Hey, are you tryin'
to steal my wallet?

30:26.440 --> 30:27.920
I just found this and--

30:27.920 --> 30:29.600
-I was gonna give it back.
-Yeah, right.

Where did you get this?

32:12.840 --> 32:14.360
She got it from me.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.040
Mitzy would never take something
that didn't belong to her.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.840
Yes, she would.

You need to teach that fish
stealing is wrong.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.440
What?

32:25.440 --> 32:27.680
Dolphins aren't fish,
they're mammals.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.800
Yes.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.480
I think I did.

45:37.480 --> 45:38.360
[chuckles]

45:38.360 --> 45:40.200
I'm gonna go change.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.400
[chuckles]

46:06.840 --> 46:09.480
[coughing]

46:10.520 --> 46:11.800
Sheryl, are you all right?

46:11.800 --> 46:14.240
I'm fine.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.720
The doctor said
the last scan was clear.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.400
It was and I'm fine.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.560
It's just a cough.

46:22.560 --> 46:23.840
You fret too much.

46:23.840 --> 46:26.840
[chuckles]

46:26.840 --> 46:29.400
Sam--

46:29.400 --> 46:32.400
I know the last few months
have been hard on you.

46:33.840 --> 46:36.280
Is that why we're doing this?

46:36.280 --> 46:37.320
I'm doing this

46:37.320 --> 46:39.920
because it's the right thing
for Annabel.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.400
She seems so happy here.

46:43.560 --> 46:46.560
But what kind of life
will she have?

46:46.560 --> 46:49.560
She's a smart talented girl.

46:49.560 --> 46:52.440
She deserves more than this.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.880
She deserves her chance
at the world.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.320
The chance Debrah never had.

46:59.280 --> 47:02.280
She's so like our Deb,
isn't she?

47:03.360 --> 47:05.320
She is.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.200
When she's older,

47:10.200 --> 47:12.040
she'll appreciate
what we're doing for her.

47:15.480 --> 47:17.600
I hope so.

47:28.080 --> 47:30.680
Oh, Mr. Williams,
what can I do for you?

47:34.920 --> 47:37.920
My wife is becoming confused.

47:37.920 --> 47:40.880
We need to expedite matters.

47:40.880 --> 47:43.880
I will not lose Anna
the way I did Deb.

47:46.960 --> 47:49.960
Is there anything more you
could be doing?

47:49.960 --> 47:52.960
Not uh, within the parameters
you established.

47:57.320 --> 48:00.320
Do what you have to do,

48:00.320 --> 48:02.760
but you get it done.

48:02.760 --> 48:19.360
[♪♪♪]

48:19.360 --> 48:20.840
Ah, Mr. Coleridge.

48:20.840 --> 48:23.840
Lovely day for boat fiddling.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.440
[sighs]

48:25.440 --> 48:26.440
You.

48:26.440 --> 48:28.920
[grunting]

48:28.920 --> 48:31.800
You know, I keep telling people

48:31.800 --> 48:34.440
that this is a private dock.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.440
You think I should
put up a sign?

48:36.440 --> 48:38.800
You know, I wouldn't bother.

48:38.800 --> 48:41.800
[taking deep breaths]

48:49.640 --> 48:52.640
My fishing license.

48:52.640 --> 48:54.680
It's been revoked.

48:54.680 --> 48:57.120
Yeah, it seems there were
some irregularities

48:57.120 --> 48:58.760
when you renewed it.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.400
And commercial fishing
without a license

49:00.400 --> 49:02.400
carries some hefty fines.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.160
Those will need
to be paid promptly

49:04.160 --> 49:06.880
or your vessel here

49:06.880 --> 49:08.600
could be impounded.

49:08.600 --> 49:11.600
Fortunately, Mr. Williams' offer

49:11.600 --> 49:14.120
is still on the table.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.160
Sam Williams is
not buying my granddaughter.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.160
Oh, of course he is.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.200
That's how the world works.

49:21.200 --> 49:22.600
Your world.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.440
Not mine.

49:24.440 --> 49:27.440
You know,
you sit on this grubby boat,

49:28.400 --> 49:30.720
on this stinking dock,

49:30.720 --> 49:33.760
surrounded by losers and bums,

49:34.920 --> 49:37.400
and you wanna fight me?

49:37.400 --> 49:39.800
Look, make this easy
and you'll still be in her life.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.880
But you make it hard,

49:42.880 --> 49:45.880
I will shut down this
Dr. Dolittle fantasy of yours.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
And I guarantee you will never
see your granddaughter again.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.480
Good day, Mr. Coleridge.

49:58.920 --> 50:00.000
[sighing]

50:02.080 --> 50:03.760
Mrs. Rolle.

50:09.920 --> 50:12.800
I came by to return the towel
you loaned Mateo

50:12.800 --> 50:15.800
and to tell you

50:15.800 --> 50:18.480
that your review
has been officially closed.

50:24.800 --> 50:27.360
What's wrong?

50:27.360 --> 50:30.400
Uh, I just don't understand
how people can be so terrible.

50:32.080 --> 50:34.040
Who's terrible?

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
It's a long story.

50:37.800 --> 50:40.800
[Desaray]
I'm a good listener.

50:42.120 --> 50:44.480
How about dinner?

50:48.960 --> 50:49.960
uh, um.

50:49.960 --> 50:50.560
[clears throat]

50:50.560 --> 50:51.840
Anna!

50:51.840 --> 50:52.840
[chuckles]

50:52.840 --> 50:54.000
What?

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
What is it?

50:55.000 --> 50:56.960
-Oh, hi, Ms. Rolle.
-Hi.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.840
Um, would you be alright
fixing your own dinner tonight?

50:59.840 --> 51:01.720
Sure, why?

51:01.720 --> 51:03.080
Why, yes, why.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.720
Well, um, uh, Desaray and I,
we thought we might--

51:05.720 --> 51:06.800
Well, you know,
we were thinking--

51:06.800 --> 51:07.800
Really?

51:07.800 --> 51:08.960
No, no!

51:08.960 --> 51:11.120
-I mean, not if you need me to-- -No, no, no, no, no, no!

51:11.120 --> 51:12.560
This is great.

51:12.560 --> 51:13.720
Yaw-haw are great.

51:13.720 --> 51:15.720
Um, Ms. Rolle,
just give us a second.

51:15.720 --> 51:16.960
Why?

51:16.960 --> 51:17.960
What's happening?

51:17.960 --> 51:19.200
You are not wearing those.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.000
Oh, I think I am.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.520
-Look, see?
-No, no.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.600
You need to put on
your nice pants.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.680
Well, these shorts are nice.

51:25.680 --> 51:27.440
Those shorts
are the opposite of nice.

51:27.440 --> 51:30.440
Nice runs and hides
from those shorts.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.200
Alright, I'll change.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.160
And your shirt.

51:34.160 --> 51:34.920
Shirt.

51:34.920 --> 51:36.000
Fine, fine.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.120
And put on your nice jacket!

51:37.120 --> 51:39.160
[Jonah]
Yes, alright!

51:39.160 --> 51:40.280
He'll be right out.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.000
You're gonna love the jacket.

51:42.000 --> 52:01.000
[♪♪♪]

52:02.480 --> 52:05.200
That was your mother

52:05.200 --> 52:08.200
when she was about your age.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.760
She's beautiful.

52:10.760 --> 52:13.600
You look very much like her.

52:14.600 --> 52:17.600
So why didn't grandfather
and her not get along?

52:20.160 --> 52:22.560
From the moment Debrah was born,

52:22.560 --> 52:25.320
She was everything
to your grandfather.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.800
The two were inseparable.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.800
[Sheryl]
So much love.

52:32.240 --> 52:35.240
Sam thought Debrah had
a great career ahead of her.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.640
But when your mother
met your father,

52:39.640 --> 52:42.200
she left her position at UNICO

52:42.200 --> 52:45.200
and uh, came down here
to work with him.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.280
Sam thought it was
a waste of her talent.

52:52.880 --> 52:55.920
So he offered your father money
to fire Debrah.

52:57.400 --> 53:00.200
[Sheryl]
A lot of money.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.200
Would have funded his research
for years.

53:05.680 --> 53:08.680
David didn't even
think about it.

53:08.680 --> 53:11.680
Wand when Deb found out,
oh, the fight they had.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.960
I've never seen either of them
so angry.

53:17.400 --> 53:19.120
[Sheryl]
I always thought that if Debrah
had lived longer

53:19.120 --> 53:22.120
they would have
found their way back together.

53:22.120 --> 53:24.080
But um

53:27.920 --> 53:30.920
Anna,
your grandfather is a good man.

53:32.520 --> 53:35.160
He loves you very much.

53:35.160 --> 53:37.640
Then why do this?

53:39.280 --> 53:42.280
I think he's afraid
of being alone.

53:43.880 --> 53:45.840
I don't understand.

53:48.760 --> 53:50.000
Good.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
You are far too young
to understand that.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.440
I came here
to give you something.

54:02.360 --> 54:05.360
This was your mother's.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.880
They returned it to me
after the accident.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.360
It's beautiful.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.360
My mother gave it to me

54:18.040 --> 54:19.920
and I gave it to Debrah.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.160
I think she'd want you
to have it.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.040
I love you, grandma.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.800
I love you, too.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.800
Thank you, my dear, dear Anna.

54:34.920 --> 54:37.360
I'm so grateful
I got to hear that.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.920
And don't worry.

54:40.920 --> 54:43.920
Life has a way of working out

54:43.920 --> 54:46.240
just the way it's supposed to.

54:54.520 --> 54:57.520
So he just
flat out threatened you?

54:57.520 --> 54:58.960
The thing is Desaray,

54:58.960 --> 55:01.200
I'm not sure
he can't do what he says.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.360
Well, he'd have to have some
pretty overwhelming evidence

55:03.360 --> 55:05.920
to get custody of a minor
overturned.

55:06.920 --> 55:08.920
You and Annabel belong together.

55:08.920 --> 55:10.960
Everyone can see that.

55:10.960 --> 55:12.920
[chuckles]

55:21.400 --> 55:22.680
Uh, thanks.

55:22.680 --> 55:23.960
[chuckles]

55:23.960 --> 55:25.920
Huh.

55:27.280 --> 55:29.520
Still worried about Annabel,
huh?

55:29.520 --> 55:31.400
Yes.

55:31.400 --> 55:32.920
Sorry.

55:32.920 --> 55:34.800
And my license.

55:34.800 --> 55:36.240
You can file an appeal.

55:36.240 --> 55:38.800
I mean, you can
always file an extension.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.400
No one's gonna
take Annabel away from you

55:40.400 --> 55:42.440
because an off-islander dug up

55:42.440 --> 55:44.280
a misfiled fishing license.

55:44.280 --> 55:45.240
You think so?

55:45.240 --> 55:47.080
I'm sure of it.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.240
Nice, Desaray.

55:49.240 --> 55:52.000
I mean, really thanks.

55:52.000 --> 55:52.800
[sighs]

55:52.800 --> 55:55.400
Uh, you've been very good.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.280
I know how much you care
about Annabel.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.800
And I wanna help you
if I can.

56:01.800 --> 56:02.840
Uh, you have helped.

56:02.840 --> 56:05.440
Just by being a friend.

56:05.440 --> 56:07.960
I wanna be your friend.

56:07.960 --> 56:09.480

[Desaray]
Mr. Carbunkle.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.560
I was just at your office,
they said you left early.

57:34.560 --> 57:36.640
Report all done?

57:36.640 --> 57:38.120
It is.

57:38.120 --> 57:39.520
I'm afraid you won't like it.

57:39.520 --> 57:42.240
Oh, that's disappointing.

57:42.240 --> 57:43.480
My report says

57:43.480 --> 57:45.800
that Mr. Coleridge is
an excellent guardian

57:45.800 --> 57:47.800
and that Anna couldn't be
in a more loving, supportive,

57:47.800 --> 57:49.400
and stable home.

57:49.400 --> 57:51.080
Really?

57:51.080 --> 57:53.640
Huh.

57:53.640 --> 57:55.360
You know, is there any way
that you would

57:55.360 --> 57:58.200
consider reevaluating
those conclusions?

58:00.200 --> 58:01.960
I understand you're
a single mother

58:01.960 --> 58:03.600
on a government salary.

58:03.600 --> 58:05.960
Perhaps a consulting fee?

58:05.960 --> 58:08.960
You predecessor in this job
is quite enjoying

58:08.960 --> 58:11.840
his early retirement
from what I understand.

58:12.840 --> 58:15.440
You're responsible
for Mr. Lewis' retirement?

58:16.440 --> 58:19.120
His relationship to Coleridge
didn't seem helpful

58:19.120 --> 58:20.160
to our case.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.720
I thought it needed new eyes.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.320
You really don't wanna come down
on the wrong side of this,

58:26.320 --> 58:28.160
Mrs. Rolle.

58:28.160 --> 58:31.160

so, Mr. Carbunkle.

59:49.480 --> 59:50.800
She asked me to meet her here.

59:50.800 --> 59:53.680
She said that she had some
important information for me.

59:53.680 --> 59:56.640
Something about a old complaint
about Mr. Coleridge.

59:56.640 --> 59:59.520
Uh, anything like that would be
on the computer files.

59:59.520 --> 1:00:00.800
I could get that for you.

1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:01.800
That would be fantatsic.

1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:02.960
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:04.320
Court today and all.

1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:05.360
Of course. I'll be right back.

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:06.960
Thank you.

Mr. Carbunkle?

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:05.560

1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:13.680
[Judge Swanson]
Well, good morning.

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:14.760
Is everyone here?

1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:16.000
Your Worship,

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000
I am representing
Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Williams--

1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.920
[Carbunkle]
Who in are requesting
full legal custody

1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:24.760
Of their granddaughter Annabel

1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:27.760
and will present evidence
that my clients are capable,

1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:30.440
both physically and financially,

1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:32.480
to provide for the child
in a safer,

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:33.920
more secure environment

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:36.920
than she is presently
being provided here to for.

1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:38.160
I see.

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:39.160
Sit down.

1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:40.160
[clears throat]

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.040
Mrs. Rolle,
you are the case worker?

1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:44.720
-Yes, Your Worship.
-Okay.

1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:47.720
Could you give us a report
on Miss Coleridge's situation?

1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:51.200
Well, I have observed
in the past week

1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:52.720
a very strong bond

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:55.520
between Mr. Coleridge
and Annabel.

1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:58.520
She appears to be a healthy,
normal, and loved young lady.

1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:00.440
I object!

1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:02.360
Your Worship, speculation.

1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:04.920
Mrs. Rolle is not
a trained medical physician

1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:07.840
and therefore cannot comment
on the health of the child.

1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:10.480
[Judge Swanson]
Mr. Carbunkle, sit down.

1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:12.240
This is not TV.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:15.200
Now, I've read all the materials

1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:16.480
submitted by both parties

1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:19.400
and I can't say I see

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:22.360
any urgent cause to
change Miss Coleridge's living--

1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:25.360
Your Worship, I move to submit
further evidence.

1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:27.520
What other evidence?

1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:28.960
With the courts permission,

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:31.960
I would like Mrs. Rolle
to read a few paragraphs--

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:35.000
[Carbunkle]
From her initial report

1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:38.000
submitted before she started
an inappropriate

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000
intimate relationship with
Mr. Coleridge.

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.480
What?

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:45.480
Mr. Carbunkle,
that is a serious accusation.

1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:47.120
I have proof, Your Worship.

1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:54.880
[♪♪♪]

1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:57.080
Mrs. Rolle, you are aware

1:02:57.080 --> 1:02:58.840
that fraternization
with a client

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:00.520
during an investigation

1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:03.320
is against
social services policies?

1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:05.840
Yes, I am, Your Worship.

1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:07.520
I have the report right here.

1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:08.960
Mrs. Rolle.

1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:14.040
I don't know where he got this.

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:15.160
I--

1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:17.120
Are you saying
you didn't write it?

1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:19.000
No, I did.

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:22.560
Well, then read it.

1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:32.760
"Annabel Coleridge is living

1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:35.760
with her grandfather
Jonah Coleridge

1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:38.760
on his fishing boat.

1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:41.720
It appears they share
the tiny bathroom

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:44.000
And showering facilities.

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000
There was a distinct smell
of fish everywhere."

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.480
It's a fishing boat!

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:51.160
-How--
-Mr. Coleridge, let her finish.

1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:55.600
"From my brief encounter
with Mr. Coleridge,

1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:58.600
he seemed uncooperative,

1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:01.480
argumentative,
and unconcerned

1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:05.600
with the whereabouts
of his granddaughter.

1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:09.280
[Desaray]
Mr. Coleridge took no action
to address the issue

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:12.280
but instead asked me to leave,

1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:14.760
denying me access to the subject

1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:16.640
of my evaluation.

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:20.520
My preliminary recommendation
would be

1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:23.040
to place the girl in foster care

1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:26.520
for her own safety
and well-being

1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:29.080
until further investigation
takes place."

1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:33.640
This is not what it seems.

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:36.520
I revaluated
and I revised

1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:37.640
the assessment.

1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:39.800
You mean you changed your report

1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:42.800
after you and Mr. Coleridge
started sleeping together.

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:45.240
We're not sleeping together!

1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:46.760
Sit down, Mr. Coleridge.

1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:48.800
[Carbunkle]
Your Worship,

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:51.240
in light of Ms. Rolle's
unprofessional behavior,

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:55.680
I move that her submitted report

1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:58.400
be stricken in favor
of this more

1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:01.240
objective analysis
of Miss Coleridge's

1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:02.360
living conditions.

1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:03.240
You can't do that!

1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:04.960
[Judge Swanson]
Mrs. Rolle!

1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:07.960
I suggest you be very careful.

1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:09.800
Your conduct has been appalling

1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:11.400
and I will be bringing
this matter

1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:13.840
to the attention of Mr. Davies.

1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:16.400
Mr. Coleridge,

1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:17.920
do you have anything else
to say?

1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:25.120
[♪♪♪]

1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:27.880
My son and his wife,

1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:31.880
they wanted to raise Anna
on this island.

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:37.360
The Williams' own daughter
wanted Anna

1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:40.360
to grow up with the values
that this place could teach her,

1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:44.040
surrounded by people
who love her.

1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:48.240
Anna is happy here.

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:52.760
She belongs here.

1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:54.680
With me.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.840
Deciding the fate of a child

1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:04.840
is always
a very difficult decision.

1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:07.320
Now, I have no doubt
about the love

1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:10.160
between Mr. Coleridge
and his granddaughter,

1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:13.160
but I cannot ignore the facts
in front of me.

1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:17.440
[Judge Swanson]
I hereby grant temporary custody

1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:20.200
to Mr. and Mrs. Williams,

1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:22.000
pending further investigation
and of course

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.520
a full review

1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:24.760
No!

[Judge Swanson]
Sit down, Mr. Coleridge.

1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:28.760
You can't take her away
from me.

1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:30.200
This is wrong!

1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:31.040
She's family!

-You are not taking her!
-Bailiff.

1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:36.920

-Anna, we are going.
-Jonah, please.

Oh, you're not takin' her

1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:44.120
You no longer have
legal custody.

1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:00.960
[Carbunkle]
Well, we do aim to please, sir.

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:02.800
And I hope
you'll keep me in mind

1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:05.800
for your future legal needs
or anything else

1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:08.440
I can do
to be of service.

1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:10.080
We should get to the airport.

1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:12.440
[Desaray]
You're not going anywhere!

1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:14.160
How dare you try
and take way this girl

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:15.800
from all the people
who love her.

1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:16.960
Ms. Rolle,
this is not the time for--

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:18.400
I'm not talking to you,

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:21.400
you dirty, lying, cheating,
conniving,

1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:23.520
weird pirate!

1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:24.840
Weird?

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:27.120
This is between me
and these people.

1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:30.160
This is none of your business.

1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:31.680
[Sam]
We're doing what's best
for our granddaughter.

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:33.400
[Desaray]
No, you're not!

1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:35.000
You are doing what's best
for you

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.400
and I'm sure
that's all you've ever done

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:39.120
your entire privileged lives!

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:40.800
[Desaray]
All you have to do
is look at Annabel

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:42.240
to see that she's heartbroken.

1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:44.480
You're doing this because you--

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:47.480
you pushed your daughter away
all those years ago,

1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:48.960
and now she's gone,

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:51.000
and there's nothing you can do
to bring her back.

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.880
[Desaray]
Nothing.

1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:55.560
Certainly not torturing
this young girl

1:12:55.560 --> 1:12:58.040
and the man
who's dedicated his life

1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:01.040
to taking care of her the way
your daughter wanted him to.

1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:05.880
Samuel, this has gone too far.

1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:07.880
Sheryl,
we discussed all of this.

1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:10.680
If we want to be part
of her life,

1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:13.720
we should move here
and be a part of her life,

1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:16.720
not force her into ours.

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:19.160
That was what we did to Debrah.

1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:21.600
Let's not make
that mistake again.

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:24.720
I don't know anymore.

1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:25.520
[chuckles]

1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:26.840
Mr. Williams,

1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:28.600
You're not actually taking
this woman seriously, are you?

1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:30.880
No, you did not just
put your hand in my face.

1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:32.440
And what if I did?

1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:34.840
[grunts]

1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:36.200
Anna?

1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:37.360
Anna?

1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:39.320
Anna?

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:42.080
[sighs]

1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:43.320
Annabel!

1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:45.200
Huh.

1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:47.040
[sighing]

1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:48.320
What is she doing?

1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:50.160
I'd guess running away.

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:51.520
Why would she do that?

1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:52.880
You really don't have a clue,
do you?

1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:54.080
Well, where would she go?

1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:55.320
Anywhere.

1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:58.080
She knows this island
like the back of her hand.

1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.480
We need to get some help.

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:01.520
What can we do?

1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:04.480
[takes a deep breath]

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.480
There's a restaurant
on the leeway side of the island

1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:07.920
called "Coconuts".

1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:10.520
Its' owned by a woman
named "Grace Johnson".

1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:12.360
Go there
and tell her what happened!

1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:13.280
I'll get Jonah.

1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:14.280
-Right.
-Okay.

1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:15.240
That woman assaulted me.

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:16.560
That was assault!

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:17.280
You saw it.

1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:18.120
They were witnesses.

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:19.200
I will sue!

1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:21.920
Shut up!

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:23.640
Did you hear what she said
to me?

1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:25.120
-Mr. Carbunkle.
-Yes, sir?

1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:26.640
Shut up!

1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:30.920
Unbelievable!

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:41.080

1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:42.800
Look, I'm just tryin'
to get a hold of this boat,

1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:44.680
I wanna go, I wanna have
a good time in the ocean,

[tourist]
I can't just--

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:48.680
How much longer
is this gonna take?

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:51.320
[boat owner]
I need to replace the fuel pump,
change the batteries.

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.840
I think it should be done
in a couple of hours.

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:02.160
Hey, what are you doing?

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:03.160
Hey, hey, hey!

1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:04.520
We need your help.

1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:06.000
What are you two doin' here?

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:07.520
[Sheryl]
No, no, it's Anna.

1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:08.600
She's run away.

1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:10.040
-What?
-[Sam] She's gone!

1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:12.000
-She's disappeared!
-Okay, alright, everyone quiet!

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:12.960
Okay, when did she go?

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:13.960
About half an hour ago.

1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:15.160
Maybe longer.

1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:16.440
Well, she couldn't have gotten
far.

1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:18.760
Um, Will and Megan,
you're gonna check the marina

1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:20.000

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.160
-James--
-Yeah.

1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:22.440
Check the local piers
and Lighthouse Bay.

1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:23.440
Okay.

1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:24.640

Wait.

1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:29.000
What can we do?

1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:30.560
Haven't you two done enough?

1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:31.440
Stop.

1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:32.480
Listen, that's their blood.
