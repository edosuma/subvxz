00:20.061 --> 00:22.105
[Estelle] Mindy, you have to understand,

00:22.188 --> 00:28.111
in my generation, body-shaming
was just a way we would kid around

00:28.194 --> 00:29.237
with each other.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.032
You know, you'd see a guy
with big ears, and you'd say,

00:32.115 --> 00:34.075
"Hey, Dumbo, where's your feather?"

00:34.159 --> 00:36.286
And no one ever got offended.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.581
It was just considered
good-natured joshing.

00:39.664 --> 00:40.540
[Martin] All righty.

00:40.623 --> 00:44.044
As a matter of fact,
Dumbo might have a clever retort like,

00:44.127 --> 00:46.755
"Careful I don't fly overhead
and take a big elephant dump on you."

00:46.838 --> 00:50.300
-[laughs] Okay. You… you made your point.
-Hang on. Take it easy.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.217
All right.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.805
When I was growing up,
I had a girlfriend named Sissy,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.307
and she had a glass eye.

00:58.349 --> 01:01.978
So, naturally, everyone called her
Sissy Cyclops,

01:02.062 --> 01:03.229
to her face.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.439
She didn't mind.

01:04.522 --> 01:08.735
After school, I would say,
"See you around, Sissy Cyclops."

01:08.818 --> 01:12.280
And she would say,
"I'll keep an eye out for you."

01:12.363 --> 01:13.198
Terrific.

01:13.281 --> 01:19.079
Now, where I went wrong was to forget
how sensitive your generation is.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.207
None of you ever lost a soccer game

01:23.333 --> 01:25.376
or a brother in Korea.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.880
I'm confused.
Is this supposed to be an apology?

01:28.963 --> 01:31.800
Yes. Yes, it… it is.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.343
Uh, and now it's my turn.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.429
Mindy, sweetie, I… I… I love you,

01:36.513 --> 01:40.517
a… and the last thing in the world
I'd want to do is hurt your feelings.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.769
And I'm not gonna let
anybody else hurt them either.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.524
[sighs] I don't--

01:47.607 --> 01:51.111
Please forgive me… [inhales]
…for not saying something last night.

01:51.194 --> 01:55.115
I should have said something.
I don't know why-- I… I… I'm an idiot.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.076
I'm an idiot,
and… and I don't deserve you.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.372
You really don't.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.791
So we're good?

02:05.834 --> 02:06.960
We're good.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.463
Martin said you're on the last train
to Clarksville.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.466
Tough break.

02:15.635 --> 02:16.678
Why would you say that?

02:18.179 --> 02:20.348
What? Midnight train to Georgia?

02:20.431 --> 02:21.266
No.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.977
No. Nothing.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.812
[theme music playing]

02:31.484 --> 02:33.153
Am I correct in assuming

02:33.236 --> 02:36.489
that Mindy's mother will be living
with you for the foreseeable future?

02:36.573 --> 02:37.407
Yes.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.284
Oh, you'll be outnumbered.

02:39.367 --> 02:43.079
-Uh, I… I don't see it that way.
-Really? You forget how to count?

02:43.163 --> 02:43.997
[grunts]

02:44.956 --> 02:45.957
Okay, just…

02:48.835 --> 02:51.921
-["Here Comes the Bride" playing]
-[indistinct chattering]

02:58.553 --> 03:00.763
[grunts] I'm gonna kill her.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.057
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill her.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.309
Not now, Mom.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.771
Well, I don't have long to live.
What are they gonna do? Give me the chair?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.482
I think, in California,
it's lethal injection.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.776
Oh my God. Stop it, both of you.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.908
Good afternoon and welcome.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.662
Thank you for joining us
as we celebrate the union

03:24.746 --> 03:29.167
of Mindy Clarice Kominsky
and Martin Lester Schneider.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.920
I am Dr. Roz Volander,

03:32.003 --> 03:37.008
and it is my great privilege,
both as Mindy's mom

03:37.091 --> 03:43.139
and as an ordained minister
of the Church of Universal Life,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.266
to perform this ceremony.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.851
Minister, schminister.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.188
Oh, I'd also like to welcome Martin's mom,

03:50.271 --> 03:51.522
Estelle.

03:51.606 --> 03:56.069
Estelle has come all the way
from Scottsdale, Arizona.

03:56.152 --> 04:01.616
Estelle, from this day forth,
our families are forever joined,

04:01.699 --> 04:06.496
bound together
by the love of our children.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.081
My daughter,

04:08.164 --> 04:10.083
in the prime of her life,

04:10.667 --> 04:11.626
and your son,

04:11.709 --> 04:13.962
in his twilight years.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.380
[guests tittering, giggling]

04:15.964 --> 04:17.715
[Roz] Uh, Mindy, Martin,

04:17.799 --> 04:20.551
the vows you are about to take

04:21.803 --> 04:24.305
are sacred vows.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.601
They have to be entered into
without doubt or hesitation.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.895
They have to be the expression

04:30.979 --> 04:33.690
of your deepest, your most heartfelt

04:34.357 --> 04:37.068
feelings of love for one another.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.070
Are you prepared to do that?

04:39.153 --> 04:40.071
Yes.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.323
Twilight years?

04:44.492 --> 04:45.702
[clears throat] Yes.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.123
-Martin, why don't you start?
-All righty. [clears throat]

04:51.124 --> 04:53.126
I had to… write it down. [chuckles]

04:53.918 --> 04:54.752
[clears throat]

04:56.296 --> 04:57.171
[clears throat]

04:58.548 --> 04:59.382
Mindy,

05:00.341 --> 05:02.176
ever since we first met,

05:02.802 --> 05:06.723
I knew you were the one
I had been searching for all my life.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.477
I remember we were
at a bookstore standing next to each other

05:11.561 --> 05:13.646
in the… the young adult section.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.524
That's… that's another story
for another time.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.777
Uh, when I noticed you were staring at me,

05:20.361 --> 05:21.612
I got a little flustered,

05:21.696 --> 05:24.907
and I asked if everything was okay.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.994
And you said
I looked like a Pez dispenser,

05:28.077 --> 05:29.579
and if you pulled on my ponytail,

05:29.662 --> 05:32.498
a little piece of candy
would pop out my mouth. [chuckles]

05:32.582 --> 05:33.750
[all laughing softly]

05:33.833 --> 05:35.835
[Martin] Needless to say, I… I laughed.

05:35.918 --> 05:40.256
And that's when I realized
it had been so long since I laughed.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.717
And I knew. I knew right then.

05:43.801 --> 05:44.677
Mindy,

05:46.471 --> 05:48.848
you are the most important woman
in my life.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.558
[scoffs, clears throat]

05:56.147 --> 05:58.775
You're the most important woman
in my life,

05:58.858 --> 06:00.943
and I want to share my life with you.

06:01.027 --> 06:06.783
And… and I vow to… to be your friend
and… and lover and… and protector

06:06.866 --> 06:11.371
for as long as God gives me life.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.581
I love you.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.541
I love you too.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.086
-Can we build a home theater?
-No.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.879
Okay.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.923
Mindy, your turn.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.011
[Mindy sighs]

06:27.762 --> 06:28.763
Martin… [sighs]

06:29.555 --> 06:30.890
…before I met you,

06:30.973 --> 06:33.142
I never thought I'd settle down
with anyone.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.728
In fact, I'd gotten used to the idea.

06:36.521 --> 06:41.025
And then I saw a Pez dispenser
thumbing through a Hunger Games book.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.528
-[guests laugh]
-The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.280
-Right.
-It's actually the prequel to the trilogy.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.657
Okay.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.868
I was planning to write a YA novel
of my own. I was doing some research.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.078
Martin.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.705
I didn't want them
to think I was some kinda weirdo.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.915
They don't think that.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.670
YA is "young adult."
Uh, it… it's the same as regular novels,

07:00.753 --> 07:03.464
only you're not having
to constantly Google what words mean.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.134
Martin… my turn.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.593
Sorry. Continue, please.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.389
And when I made a lame joke
about it and he laughed,

07:11.472 --> 07:14.016
I was suddenly struck
by how big a heart he had.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.311
I also knew he didn't have the courage
to ask me out.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.479
I did not.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.940
-So I asked him.
-She did.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.900
And here we are.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.862
[inhales] I love you,
Martin Lester Schneider.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.448
And I vow to always care for you,

07:28.531 --> 07:29.824
fight for you,

07:29.907 --> 07:31.117
and laugh with you.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.954
That's great. Now, who has the rings?

07:35.037 --> 07:36.080
[gasps]

07:42.462 --> 07:45.381
Yes, all right. Martin, repeat after me.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.591
With this ring…

07:47.300 --> 07:48.301
With this ring…

07:48.384 --> 07:50.011
[Roz] I do thee wed.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.471
I do thee wed.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.639
[Roz] Till death do us part.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.224
Till death do us part.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.893
Which will most likely be me.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.352
Which will most-- Hey.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.938
-[guests laugh]
-Sorry. It was just sitting there.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.231
-[guests laugh]
-Yeah.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.400
-Look at him.
-[Roz] All right, Mindy…

08:04.484 --> 08:06.068
Not like we'd be cutting his life short.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.278
[Roz] Repeat after me.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.406
[Phoebe] That's terrible.
How could you even think that?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.409
He'll reincarnate into a baby body.
No harm, no foul.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.994
-No. Forget it.
-[Mindy] With this ring…

08:15.077 --> 08:16.454
We wouldn't have to do a thing.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.039
-I know a guy.
-[Mindy] I thee wed…

08:18.122 --> 08:21.250
-What do you mean, you know a guy?
-A guy who knows a guy.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.378
I'm one guy removed from the guy
who knows a guy.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.422
-I'm guy-adjacent.
-[Mindy] …till death do us part.

08:26.506 --> 08:31.844
Okay. By the power granted to me
by this phony-baloney Internet scam…

08:31.928 --> 08:36.224
-[all laughing]
-…I now pronounce you husband and wife.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.434
You may kiss each other.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.480
[guests applauding]

08:49.820 --> 08:53.199
If you stay in Arizona,
everything's gonna be fine.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.829
-Hi. Hi!
-[Roz chuckles]

08:58.913 --> 09:01.165
-You guys look amazing.
-Oh.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.084
-[Mindy] Oh, thank you.
-Sandy.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.754
-[Sandy] Are you all right?
-Get me out of here.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.589
Everything okay?

09:08.673 --> 09:11.592
-Oh, yeah. All good.
-We're gonna go make out.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.344
Uh, he's promised me a dry hump.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.557
-Let me get you some water.
-[grunts]

09:17.640 --> 09:20.393
Yes, please. [chuckles]

09:21.227 --> 09:23.229
Why don't you let me take you
to your doctor.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.481
No. No, no, no. I just-- I need to rest.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
-[Sandy] Roz, please.
-No!

09:28.192 --> 09:30.486
I am not going to miss Mindy's wedding.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.737
Or fuck it up either.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.198
All right. All right. [sighs]

09:35.366 --> 09:37.285
Oh, Jesus.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.121
I don't know which is worse.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.873
Leukemia or… [chuckles]

09:42.957 --> 09:44.542
…or the treatment for leukemia.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.672
-Can we at least call the doctor?
-Yeah, all right. No. No. Now, listen.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.841
This is what's gonna happen.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.176
We're gonna go back in there.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.929
We're gonna greet the guests,

09:57.471 --> 09:59.390
eat the pumpkin ravioli,

10:00.558 --> 10:01.684
make a toast.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.854
You will dance with your daughter.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.691
I will dance with the Pez dispenser,

10:09.191 --> 10:14.363
and with any luck, I'll be drunk enough
to vomit all over his mother.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.324
You've thought this through.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.076
Oh, I'm a planner, honey.
That's what I do.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.119
[chuckles]

10:20.202 --> 10:21.037
All right.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.705
One moment.

10:23.497 --> 10:24.415
[sips]

10:25.333 --> 10:26.250
[grunts]

10:27.710 --> 10:30.296
All right. Let's do this. [grunts]

10:34.050 --> 10:35.551
Your puke will be orange.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.011
What?

10:37.553 --> 10:39.138
The pumpkin ravioli.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.724
[chuckles] Oh, yeah. Great.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.188
[emotional music playing]

10:48.481 --> 10:49.982
[car engine revving softly]

10:56.280 --> 10:58.366
[phone ringing]

10:59.659 --> 11:01.285
[phone ringing, beeps]

11:01.911 --> 11:03.913
What are you doing up so early?

11:03.996 --> 11:06.123
[Roz] Me? What about you?

11:06.791 --> 11:09.502
I got up to pee
for, like, the… the ninth time

11:09.585 --> 11:11.253
and decided that was enough.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.880
I give up.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.549
Well, at least you got a little sleep.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.803
All night long
I've got nurses coming in here,

11:18.886 --> 11:22.431
taking my blood,
taking my pulse, taking my weight.

11:22.515 --> 11:26.352
Who the fuck needs to know what I weigh
at four o'clock in the morning?

11:26.435 --> 11:29.397
[Sandy chuckles] What can I do for you?

11:29.480 --> 11:32.316
[Roz] I saw a commercial last night
for your movie.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.443
It looks really good.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.487
You getting excited?

11:36.987 --> 11:40.074

it's hard to tell the difference.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.870
[Roz] Oh, that would be nice.
I think Mindy's coming.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.581

-[Roz] Would you bring me some edibles?

12:11.772 --> 12:13.482
[Roz] I don't understand.

12:15.276 --> 12:19.447

about being an acting coach.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.575
My dream

12:23.159 --> 12:24.535
was to be an actor.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.665
When that didn't happen,

12:30.875 --> 12:34.462
I convinced myself that, uh,
teaching was what I was meant to do.

12:36.922 --> 12:41.218
That it was actually better than my, uh…
than my silly childhood dream.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.220
[Roz] Are you looking
at the billboard again?

12:43.804 --> 12:45.890
-Yeah.
-[Roz] Walk away, Sandy.

12:45.973 --> 12:49.393
-[Sandy] Why do I feel like crying?
-[Roz] Walk away.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.187
This… this late in life, I just--

12:51.270 --> 12:53.731
I don't know
how to deal with a dream coming true.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.941
[Roz] How about you just enjoy it?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.194
No, that doesn't sound right.

It's been over a year.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.093
[Martin] So is mine.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.180
[Mindy] My mother is in the hospital
fighting for her life.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.015

Give her time.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.655
-[Estelle] Mindy?
-What?

13:43.197 --> 13:46.700
If it's not inconvenient, could you stop
and get me some more Pringles?

13:46.784 --> 13:49.119
-[Mindy] Sure.
-The kind with jalapeño.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.204
[Mindy] Okay.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.832
-Not the wavy, the flat.
-[Mindy] Right.

13:52.915 --> 13:56.168
And if you're going to the hospital,
send my love to your mom.

13:57.044 --> 14:00.172
-I will.
-She's a real fighter. She'll beat this.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.259
-I hope so.
-Or she won't. Who knows?

14:04.468 --> 14:05.678
Goodbye, Estelle.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.848
-Mindy.
-What?

14:08.931 --> 14:11.183
Never mind. I don't want to be a bother.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.852
Tell me, Estelle.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.772
If the hospital's near a CVS,
could you pick me up some Dulcolax?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.691
-[Mindy] Okay. Mm-hmm.
-The pink box.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.694
It's marketed as a stool softener
for pregnant ladies,

14:21.777 --> 14:23.445
but I find it to be very effective.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.488
