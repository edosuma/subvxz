29:51.000 --> 29:52.640
What's wrong with you?

29:53.680 --> 29:54.647

Apocalypse,</i> baby!

29:54.720 --> 29:55.960
JEREMY: And somehow,
he's whooping my ass!

29:56.120 --> 29:57.485
I'm about to whoop
both your asses.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.960
Do you know where
you are right now?

29:58.984 --> 30:00.121
At the pool.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.964
We're in Vegas!
Why are you screaming?

30:02.360 --> 30:03.600
Mr. Ward?
Yes.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.160
Care for another drink?
You know what?

30:05.184 --> 30:06.390
Mmm-hmm.
(SLURPING)

30:08.440 --> 30:10.200
Yes. You know what?
Give me something strong.

30:10.224 --> 30:12.246
And give me five more
shots of testosterone

30:12.320 --> 30:13.920
for these ladies that
I'm with right now.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.086
Thank you.
Yes.

30:15.160 --> 30:18.080
Boy, I'd like to climb that mountain
right there, I'll tell you that much.

30:18.104 --> 30:19.206
That is a big badonkadonk.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.282
All of a sudden, you're
good at video games, huh?

30:21.360 --> 30:23.283
Listen, I play this
every night with Duke.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.964
Duke's a great kid.
He cracks me up.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.600
You know what he asked
me earlier today?

30:26.624 --> 30:29.514
If, after the wedding, if it would
be okay if he called me "Dad".

30:29.640 --> 30:31.165
Time out.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.890
Let me ask you a question.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.280
That doesn't freak
you out at all?

30:34.304 --> 30:35.304
What?

30:35.360 --> 30:36.805
Out of nowhere, all of a sudden...
Boom!

30:36.880 --> 30:38.360
You're an instant dad,
just like that.

30:38.435 --> 30:40.235
You're responsible for
this whole other human.

30:40.304 --> 30:41.520
No. Not a cat, not a dog.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.727
This is a human, with teeth
and hair and bones and blood.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.882
What if they hurt somebody?
What if they get kidnapped?

30:46.960 --> 30:48.040
Or if they kidnap somebody?

30:48.080 --> 30:49.127
Either way, it's all down to you

30:49.240 --> 30:50.287
for the rest of your life.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.486
That doesn't freak you out?

30:51.560 --> 30:53.369
No. I'm excited
about it.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.320
I don't even know
why I ask you stuff.

30:55.389 --> 30:56.993
I want you to stand up
and enjoy this...

30:57.069 --> 30:58.160
Wow!

30:58.240 --> 30:59.605
Man, you gotta
take one of these.

31:02.520 --> 31:03.965
Oh, you're looking at
the wrong people, man.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.166
You need to be
looking in the pool.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.880
You got your pick
of the litter out there.

31:06.955 --> 31:09.276
They look good, but we need
some men, and you fit the bill.

31:09.355 --> 31:10.844
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah.

31:10.920 --> 31:11.960

just rolls up on you.

31:24.040 --> 31:28.443
She's like, "Do you mind helping me
with a little bit of suntan lotion?"

31:28.520 --> 31:29.521
What do you do?

31:29.600 --> 31:31.280
It'd never happen,
but I'd stand my ground.

31:31.304 --> 31:32.908
Hello, Blue Eyes.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.520
I was hoping you could help me.

31:34.544 --> 31:36.626

Hmm.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.522

32:27.400 --> 32:29.767
You know that men spend their entire
life savings to go to Brazil?

come over here,

And cocktails at a couple clubs.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.485
Maybe take in a show.

34:22.639 --> 34:25.210
Good. Then you'll
have plenty of time.

Well, I need it.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.240
Ced, what happened?
What are you doing?

53:58.280 --> 54:00.123
I gotta win some money, Dom.
For what?

54:00.200 --> 54:01.201
I gotta win money right now.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.327
Ced, wait!
Stop, stop. Talk to me.

54:02.400 --> 54:03.686
What, Dom, what?
What happened?

54:03.800 --> 54:05.720
The room was a lot more
than I expected it to be.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.404
All right, cool.
So, how much?

54:07.480 --> 54:09.323
$36,000 a night more.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.361
You ain't got it, Dom.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.369

54:15.480 --> 54:17.084

Just give it back.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.326
Ced, one second.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.686
Just tell me what happened.

54:20.760 --> 54:22.360

54:23.819 --> 54:25.289

54:26.600 --> 54:28.204
I got you.
No, you don't got me!

54:28.320 --> 54:30.641
What makes it worse is I put the
entire $40,000 on Gail's company card.

54:30.800 --> 54:31.801
What did you do that for?

54:31.880 --> 54:33.962

you marry their family.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.282
And I can't marry Miss Loretta.

Accept what you cannot change,

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.966
My grandma Eleanor told me that
the day I married Bennett,

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.249

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.970

You can, but you can't
change a man's nature.

Exactly.
She's right.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.404

I'm not mad about that, it's just,
I feel like he's pulling away,

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.963
and every time
I talk about this wedding

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.929
or your dress or the fact
that I'm a bridesmaid,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.890

where he just looks horrified.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.121
Maybe he's just afraid
of being married.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.009
But I never said anything
about getting married,

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.160
so why would he think that?

01:04:50.193 --> 01:04:52.273
Probably because all his
friends are getting married?

01:04:52.297 --> 01:04:54.366
All men are terrified
of getting married,

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.683

they're never gonna get to do.
