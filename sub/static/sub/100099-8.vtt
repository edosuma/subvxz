00:01.523 --> 00:03.003
Previously onSupergirl...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.613
This Earth-Bender
has been spotted

00:04.656 --> 00:06.223
at the scene of the crime
throughout history.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.182
Pompeii, even as far back
as Noah's flood.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.922
He literally manipulates
the Earth.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.665
You won't survive me again,
Kryptonian.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.583
No! No, Russ!
Please, somebody help!

00:18.627 --> 00:22.326
I beg your forgiveness
by submitting myself
to the bond.

00:28.289 --> 00:31.335
With his dying breath,
he told me
that you were Supergirl.

00:31.379 --> 00:34.121
You reassured me, ad nauseam,
you would never lie to me.

00:34.164 --> 00:37.733
And all the while,
there wasn't a single honest
moment in our friendship.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.952
Please, don't leave
the fortress
with Myriad.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.999
Please don't let my mistake
push you to do
something terrible.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.132
Intruder!

00:45.175 --> 00:46.307
- I'm not a villain.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.352
You shouldn't have
treated me like one.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.882
Kara.

00:56.926 --> 01:00.060
It's the Fortress's defenses.
Someone's turned them
against Supergirl.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.412
We couldn't reach you on comms.

01:04.455 --> 01:05.804
What happened?
Are you all right?

01:05.848 --> 01:07.502
I traced Rama Khan's
energy trail here.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.634
-I have to find Lena.
-What did Rama Khan do?

01:09.678 --> 01:12.028
It wasn't him.
It was Lena. She knew.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.160
She knew what?

01:13.203 --> 01:15.205
My identity.
She's known for months.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.340
Lex told her,
and she hates me for it.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.170
Lena's in Mount Norquay.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.607
Mount Norquay is one
of Lex's old hideouts.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.393
-Where are you going?
-To fix this.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.615
Get Myriad online
and operational.

01:33.658 --> 01:36.183
Non Nocere launches
within the hour.

01:37.314 --> 01:40.970
And, Hope, excellent work
preparing the move.

01:42.972 --> 01:46.106
Our Q-wave generator
is ready to integrate
with Myriad.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.197
Supergirl?

01:52.677 --> 01:55.332
Don't worry.
The bunker's lead-lined.
She can't find us.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.291
These are Lex's
countermeasures.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.515
What do we do?

02:05.429 --> 02:06.430
Ms. Luthor?

02:07.692 --> 02:08.737
Deploy.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.613
That should keep her at bay.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.877
- What's happening now?

02:18.921 --> 02:20.749
It appears to be re-arming
the cannons with Kryptonite.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.707
-Cancel it.
-It's on an automatic override.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.709
-Shut it down.
-It's not responding.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.102
Shut it down now!

02:29.105 --> 02:31.803
Lena, don't do this.

02:43.815 --> 02:46.209
We must stay true
to our mission.

02:46.253 --> 02:50.213
We don't kill people...
no matter how much
they've hurt us.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.003
I'm not gonna give up on you.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.108
What happened?

03:16.152 --> 03:18.110
How did Supergirl and Luther
beat you again?

03:18.154 --> 03:20.112
It doesn't matter how.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.289
I just need to explain to her.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.551
I wouldn't do that.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.425
They're whispering about you.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.384
That you've lost your edge.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.516
Earthquakes
with no death counts,

03:32.560 --> 03:34.953
floods with the ferocity
of a leaky faucet.

03:34.997 --> 03:39.219
They're saying that the Elder
may put Tezumak in charge.

03:39.697 --> 03:40.872
Tezumak?

03:42.787 --> 03:45.355
His tactic of war
is without limits.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.662
He could accidentally
burn down the earth.

03:47.705 --> 03:48.967
I agree.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.492
I have been in charge
for two million years.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.407
And you've been losing lately,

03:53.450 --> 03:55.452
and he'll hold that
against you.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.932
Tezumak is a snake.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.760
Oh, and let me guess.
Next is your advice

03:58.803 --> 04:02.416
about how your way
is so much more efficient.

04:02.459 --> 04:05.375
Tezumak isn't the only
manipulator around here.

04:05.419 --> 04:08.335
Look, what I said
yesterday was unfair.

04:08.378 --> 04:11.338
Yes, I believe
my technology would work.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.862
But I agree.

04:13.905 --> 04:17.168
Your way is more efficient.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.389
This isn't about ego,
Rama Khan.

04:20.434 --> 04:22.610
It's about saving the earth.

04:22.653 --> 04:26.353
The world is
at a tipping point.
There's no turning back.

04:26.396 --> 04:31.096
The humans
will destroy this planet
unless we destroy them first.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.184
But how?

04:32.707 --> 04:35.362
The Kryptonian won't stop.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.494
She will die
to protect these humans.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.583
Then let Supergirl die trying.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.586
The planets are coming
into alignment

04:42.630 --> 04:46.286
for the first time
in nearly 2,000 years.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.939
But only for tonight.

04:47.983 --> 04:51.552
The last time this happened,
I wiped out Pompeii.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.641
A masterpiece worth repeating.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.687
If a little on the blunt side.

04:57.906 --> 05:01.779
Not even Supergirl
can stop a massive volcano.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.608
The Staff of the Shadow World

05:04.652 --> 05:06.306
is worthless
without the Medallion.

05:06.349 --> 05:10.484
You need the Medallion's power,
not the Medallion itself.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.312
And you know
where that power is.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.184
Acrata.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.884
Supergirl.
Hey, did you find Lena?

05:19.928 --> 05:21.495
What was she doing
in Lex's bunker?

05:21.538 --> 05:23.975
Brainy, can you get some line
of communication to a bunker

05:24.019 --> 05:26.021
three miles below
the Norquay mountain range?

05:26.064 --> 05:27.936
Yes, but depending
on the processing power--

05:27.979 --> 05:31.461
Okay, stop.
Just tell me right now,

05:31.505 --> 05:33.550
when did Lex tell Lena
your identity?

05:33.594 --> 05:35.160
And why was she attacking you
in the Fortress?

05:35.204 --> 05:37.554
-What the hell is going on?
-It was after Shelley Island.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.948
-But Lex died there.
-No, he didn't.

05:39.991 --> 05:45.910
He portaled somehow
to a safe house
where Lena shot him.

05:45.954 --> 05:49.436
She killed him to protect me,
to protect all of us.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.525
But before he died,
he told her.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.614
She's been lying to us
for months.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.921
Okay, so why attack you now?

05:56.965 --> 05:59.359
So she could steal Myriad
from the Fortress.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.580
Lena stole Myriad?

06:03.624 --> 06:05.930
It's how I tracked her
to Norquay,

06:05.974 --> 06:08.498
but I don't think
this is what it looks like.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.501
She saved me from Rama Khan
in the Fortress.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.634
And even at Lex's bunker,

06:13.677 --> 06:17.507
the cannons were loaded
with Kryptonite,
but she didn't use them.

06:17.551 --> 06:18.987
I can still fix this.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.903
I can get through to her,
if I could just talk to her.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.557
Brainy, can you
get me in there?

06:23.600 --> 06:25.428
We could harness the Kryptonian
cache crystals we have here

06:25.472 --> 06:27.691
to covertly project
a hologram beam
into her bunker.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.606
-Great.
-Okay, if not for mind control

06:29.650 --> 06:32.435
over the population,
then why would
Lena need Myriad?

06:32.479 --> 06:34.611
-I think I might know.

06:38.354 --> 06:39.355
Malefic.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.842
Engage Psychic Inhibitors.

06:47.885 --> 06:50.192
-Alex, please.
-Agent Dox,
apprehend the suspect.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.673
Alex, please!
Malefic and I mind-melded.

06:52.716 --> 06:56.198
I know his true intentions.
He is here to help.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.678
He has some information...

06:59.201 --> 07:00.202
about Lena.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.770
I was her prisoner.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.691
Okay, first, how did you escape
the Phantom Zone?

07:10.734 --> 07:13.607
I didn't escape.
I was never there.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.479
When the Phantom Zone Projector
hit me at the planetarium,

07:16.523 --> 07:18.307
I went directly
to Ms. Luthor's lab.

07:18.350 --> 07:21.658
Lena was the one
who helped Brainy
fix the Phantom Zone Projector.

07:21.702 --> 07:22.964
She must have changed
the end coordinates.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.618
But what did she need you for?

07:24.661 --> 07:26.141
Mind control.

07:26.184 --> 07:29.405
She was experimenting
with my ability to incept.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.103
If Lena can harness
Malefic's Q-waves
and merge them with the power

07:32.147 --> 07:35.063
of Myriad's distribution,
the results
would be unprecedented.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.674
World-wide total control
in an instant.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.937
But we don't know
her intentions.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.462
She's trying to make
people less violent.

07:42.505 --> 07:46.509
You use Myriad to impose
your will on the world
population, not save it.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.076
She's hurting.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.730
All she's experienced
are people hurting each other,

07:49.773 --> 07:51.427
the same way I did.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.256
-Clearly, she thinks
she's doing good.
- It's true.

07:55.736 --> 07:59.304
I had long planned
to destroy my brother,

07:59.348 --> 08:02.351
but Ms. Luthor said
it went against her morality
and stopped me.

08:02.394 --> 08:06.747
Alex, she's not hurting anyone.
Not even Malefic, her prisoner.

08:06.790 --> 08:07.922
I can still save her.

08:07.965 --> 08:11.012
-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do.

08:11.055 --> 08:13.667
I'm the one who hurt her,
so I'm going to fix this.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.625
Brainy, get the
hologram online.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.509
-Acrata.

08:31.119 --> 08:34.731
-I have a job for you.
-And I have one for you.

08:34.775 --> 08:39.169
You can tell them to stop
sending agents like you
with jobs for me.

08:39.214 --> 08:43.523
After everything
Leviathan has done to me,
taken from me...

08:44.480 --> 08:46.438
you can tell them that I quit.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.103
-What are you?
-What am I?

08:59.147 --> 09:02.237
I am Rama Khan,
guardian of this Earth,

09:02.280 --> 09:04.108
the one who endowed you
with your powers.

09:06.110 --> 09:09.157
I understand the pain of loss.

09:10.637 --> 09:14.292
Obey me and I will
offer you a way out.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.040
Tell me what you want.

09:23.084 --> 09:26.391
One last job,
then you will be released.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.829
And my father?

09:28.872 --> 09:30.874
Your father
can keep his riches.

09:32.441 --> 09:33.921
For what little they're worth.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.236
Hologram online
and ready to commence.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.064
Good luck.

09:51.503 --> 09:55.116
-It's almost ready, Ms. Luthor.
-We are so close, Hope.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.510
I'll finish
consolidating the data.

09:58.554 --> 09:59.729
We can save them.

10:00.861 --> 10:01.905
All of them.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.607
Lena.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.611
Supergirl.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.701
-Please, just hear me out.
-Save your breath.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.660
You showed me
who you really are,
and I believe you.

10:17.704 --> 10:21.055
You have every right
to say that,
but don't do this.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.057
Do what?

10:23.100 --> 10:25.886
Whatever it is you're planning
on doing with Myriad
and Malefic's Q-waves.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.322
Did it ever occur to you

10:27.365 --> 10:29.106
that I was gonna do something
good for the world?

10:29.150 --> 10:31.500
With Myriad,
people won't understand.

10:31.543 --> 10:34.285
Of course,
you assumed the worst.
I'm not the bad guy.

10:34.329 --> 10:38.072
I know. You spent years
trying to be open and trusting,

10:38.115 --> 10:40.814
even when everyone expected you
to be like your family.

10:40.857 --> 10:44.861
Even when everyone in your life
let you down.

10:44.905 --> 10:48.909
Even when I was weak
and lied to you,

10:48.952 --> 10:53.696
knowing that all you
ever asked for was the truth,

10:53.740 --> 10:54.741
you were always better.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.744
Lex took advantage
of my weakness

10:57.787 --> 10:59.833
and he used it
to manipulate you.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.792
He wanted my mistakes
to change you.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.622
He wanted you to become him.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.972
But you are nothing like him.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.670
Nothing.

11:12.236 --> 11:15.152
Don't let my mistakes turn you
into something you're not.

11:17.589 --> 11:18.765
I am good.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.506
And I always was.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.292
Lex didn't change me
and you didn't
change me either.

11:24.335 --> 11:27.382
You just exposed me
to the ugliness of humanity.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.863
You did me a favor, Kara.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.517
I learned what kind of
deceitful person
you really are,

11:32.561 --> 11:34.868
and that's what
inspired me to do this.

11:34.911 --> 11:38.306
-Lena--
-Your words mean
nothing to me anymore.

11:38.349 --> 11:41.352
Spare us both the drama.
Leave me alone.

11:41.831 --> 11:42.832
Wait.

11:49.621 --> 11:50.666
Hey.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.800
You okay?

11:55.192 --> 11:56.193
No.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.807
I couldn't get through to her.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.549
Sorry.

12:04.593 --> 12:09.554
You know, a part of me
always knew that this
couldn't be that easy.

12:11.905 --> 12:15.386
And I get it.
I fully understand
why she feels betrayed.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.520
It's so hard for her
to trust people.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.871
But I made her trust me.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.309
Over and over again,
I made her believe

12:25.353 --> 12:28.965
that I was the best friend
who would never ever hurt her.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.927
And then she finds out
in the most horrible way

12:33.970 --> 12:38.061
that our entire friendship
was based on lies.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.760
Look, you were damned
either way, Kara.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.026
Your choice to
conceal your identity,

12:46.069 --> 12:49.943
it wasn't born out of a place
of maliciousness.

12:49.986 --> 12:52.946
It was born out of love
and compassion.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.296
And you were just trying
to protect your family.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.993
And you were
trying to protect Lena

12:57.037 --> 13:00.562
from people who could use
that information to hurt us.

13:01.606 --> 13:04.827
And look, I love Lena, too.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.612
I am deeply upset
by what is going on.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.485
But this...

13:10.528 --> 13:13.140
This isn't just two friends
that are in a fight.

13:13.183 --> 13:16.056
This is someone
who has turned a corner.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.798
No, but this is not her.
This is not our Lena.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.626
Well, who is our Lena?
I mean...

13:21.670 --> 13:26.109
She knew that Lex
was out of prison,
and she said nothing.

13:26.153 --> 13:30.200
She kept Sam Arias locked
in a subbasement at L-Corp,

13:30.244 --> 13:34.161
knowing that she was Reign,
and she said nothing.

13:35.162 --> 13:38.034
She knows
how to make Kryptonite,

13:38.078 --> 13:40.036
and she kept that
hidden from us.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.865
Lena is leading her
own double-life.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.345
You are making her sound
like a Luthor.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.390
Maybe that's because
she is one.

13:47.739 --> 13:50.525
We can't put our faith
in some distant hope

13:50.568 --> 13:53.354
that she's gonna
do the right thing...

13:53.397 --> 13:56.313
...when every single action

13:56.357 --> 13:59.926
that she has taken up until now
points to the contrary.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.971
Okay, we have
to stop her, Kara.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.408
The safety of the world
depends on that.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.977
She is not Lex.
I will not treat her
like a villain.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.980
I know you won't.
That's why I have to.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.331
What are you talking about?

14:14.375 --> 14:17.639
When you went to speak to her,
we used the hologram

14:17.682 --> 14:20.337
to piggyback a virus
into the bunker's mainframe.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.167
Alex, you used me?

14:24.211 --> 14:26.822
In a few moments,
Lena's defenses will be down

14:26.866 --> 14:28.780
and Myriad will be stalled.

14:28.824 --> 14:31.392
By then, if we have to take
more drastic actions,

14:31.435 --> 14:33.916
Claymore 3 is positioned
above Mount Norquay.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.093
-What? Oh.
-And I will give her time
to surrender.

14:38.442 --> 14:41.184
Kara, we have to
start thinking with our heads,

14:41.881 --> 14:43.360
not with our hearts.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.411
It's ready, Ms. Luthor.

14:57.461 --> 15:01.161
Supergirl caused you
a great deal of pain.
I can see it in your eyes.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.945
After my family
and after Andrea,

15:02.989 --> 15:04.947
I knew better than to trust
in friendship anymore.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.603
All of the anguish that
you're going through,
it doesn't seem worth it.

15:08.646 --> 15:12.128
It inspired Non Nocere.
It inspired you.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.569
Who needs friends
when you can save the world?

15:20.702 --> 15:23.183
Myriad is ready to launch.

15:23.226 --> 15:27.274
Ms. Luthor,
this is your moment.
Shall I activate?

15:29.798 --> 15:34.324
-Three, two...
-One.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.809
-What's happening?
-It won't lock
onto the satellite.

15:40.852 --> 15:44.073
Something's interfering with
the dishes' ability to move.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.643
It's a virus. It's working
through our mainframe.

15:48.686 --> 15:51.994
-Ms. Luthor, the hologram.
-It was a Trojan horse.
Of course.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.736
How could I be so naive
to think that Supergirl
wanted to talk?

15:54.779 --> 15:57.173
If the virus spreads, the DEO
will be able to deactivate

15:57.217 --> 15:59.610
our security defenses
in 20 minutes.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.569
We need a workaround
before then.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.658
We could manually
unlock the arrays.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.616
No, Lex has booby-trapped
this entire place.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.750
There'll be a lethal failsafe
if I try to tamper
with the dishes.

16:08.793 --> 16:09.881
Then I'll go.

16:10.839 --> 16:11.840
No, you can't.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.712
You're too great an asset.

16:14.756 --> 16:17.106
Ms. Luthor, one of my
prime directives,
as you programmed,

16:17.150 --> 16:21.458
was to ensure the
success of Non Nocere.
If that means self-sacrifice--

16:21.502 --> 16:23.808
No. Even if you could
manually reset it,

16:23.852 --> 16:26.507
there's no telling the extent
of the virus's damage.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.988
All right, we may need you.

16:30.163 --> 16:31.773
It'd be short-sighted
to lose you now.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.124
If we could
replicate the virus,

16:35.168 --> 16:36.473
we could reverse-engineer it

16:36.517 --> 16:38.214
and override the
shutoff remotely, okay?

16:38.258 --> 16:39.999
I'll need some help.

16:42.523 --> 16:43.611
Very well.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.092
Accessing files.

16:46.135 --> 16:49.834
J'onn, you don't
need to stay here.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.140
I deserve to be locked up.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.837
We both shoulder the blame

16:52.881 --> 16:55.057
for the transgressions
of our past, Malefic,

16:55.101 --> 16:58.539
but together,
we will move beyond them.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.497
-J'onn, J'onn.
-What's up?

17:00.541 --> 17:05.111
Alex, she thinks Lena
is past the point of no return.

17:05.154 --> 17:07.809
She's got Claymore 3
pointed directly at the bunker.

17:07.852 --> 17:11.900
But you can talk to her, right?
Show her that she's wrong?

17:11.943 --> 17:15.208
You know people can change.
Look at you and Malefic.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.560
I can still save Lena.
I just need more time.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.258
I was in Alex's position
back on Mars

17:22.301 --> 17:24.913
when I banished Malefic
to the Phantom Zone.

17:24.955 --> 17:28.612
I did so because I thought
I was protecting my people.

17:28.656 --> 17:32.355
But I banished him
because I was afraid,
because there was no other way.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.618
Right, and look
at the two of you now.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.491
The only reason Malefic and I
were able to
come through the other side

17:37.534 --> 17:39.536
is because
we can see each other's pain.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.408
You've already talked to Lena.

17:41.451 --> 17:45.716
I'm not saying Alex is right,
but what other option
does she have?

17:45.760 --> 17:48.284
No. There has got
to be another way to stop Lena

17:48.328 --> 17:50.330
that isn't blowing her up
in a bunker.

17:52.767 --> 17:53.768
Malefic.

17:55.335 --> 17:59.861
Malefic, you said Lena was
analyzing your Q-waves, right?

17:59.904 --> 18:01.602
Yes.

18:01.645 --> 18:05.345
She isolated a frequency
which allowed her
to replicate my ability.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.173
Maybe you're the key.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.392
If we could harness
your Q-waves--

18:09.436 --> 18:12.221
We could use them
to counteract Lena's.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.615
But she's launching
a worldwide attack.

18:14.658 --> 18:18.097
The amount of energy
Malefic would need
to counteract hers...

18:18.140 --> 18:19.228
It could kill him.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.969
It's worth the risk.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.319
No, I am not trading
one life for another.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.278
Please.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.977
If I can stop Ms. Luthor
from making the same
mistakes that I did,

18:29.020 --> 18:32.111
then all of the turmoil
and pain that I've caused

18:32.154 --> 18:33.677
will be worth something.

18:34.678 --> 18:35.897
Let me help.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.247
Let me make amends.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.870
Who's the target?

18:54.524 --> 18:56.047
You're looking at it.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.748
A supervolcano?

19:00.791 --> 19:04.621
No. You can't be serious.
You'd be killing all of them.

19:10.018 --> 19:14.892
Extinction level events
have been happening
since the beginning of time.

19:14.936 --> 19:18.679
I should know.
I was here to make them happen.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.422
What have these people
done to deserve this?

19:25.555 --> 19:28.645
Existence is their sin.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.307
Don't think of this as the end.

19:38.351 --> 19:41.441
Think of this as giving
the world a second chance.

19:41.484 --> 19:46.185
For years I've worked for you,
telling myself
there was a just cause.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.274
No more.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.668
Maybe I can't beat you...

19:52.930 --> 19:54.541
but you don't think
Supergirl will?

19:55.368 --> 19:59.546
Supergirl is not a god. I am!

20:10.731 --> 20:13.342
-What's going on?
-There's been
a perimeter breach.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.475
-Do we have a location?
-Negative.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.349
Help! Rama Khan is coming.
He's gonna destroy the--

20:30.533 --> 20:32.187
You fool.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.146
I'm saving this planet.

20:39.325 --> 20:44.373
Now I will remake the earth,
as I should have done
a long time ago.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.683
It's a pity you won't be here
to see it.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.786
But Leviathan thanks you
for your service.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.270
Brainy, I need a status update.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.446
Eleven minutes until the
bunker's defenses are down.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.143
-Alex, about the bunker--
-And Rama Khan?

21:15.186 --> 21:17.319
I've analyzed security footage
of the appearance of the Shadow

21:17.363 --> 21:18.625
and of the object
she was carrying.

21:18.668 --> 21:21.367
It's called "The Staff
of the Shadow World."

21:21.410 --> 21:23.934
It is an artifact associated
with ancient Mesopotamians,

21:23.978 --> 21:25.936
but can also be found
in Herculaneum.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.417
I juxtaposed our image
with historical images
of Rama Khan and voila.

21:28.461 --> 21:31.464
The two were last seen
in the ancient city-state
of Pompeii.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.422
-That's concerning.
-Indeed.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.816
Especially as it seems
the energy given off
by the Staff

21:35.859 --> 21:38.340
can be found in one other place
in National City.

21:38.384 --> 21:41.125
The building where we assumed
Leviathan was hiding.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.736
That's across the street
from the Tar Pits.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.955
Also the site of
a dormant supervolcano.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.175
The last eruption
was in the early Cenozoic Era,

21:47.218 --> 21:50.396
and was 10,000 times
more powerful than Pompeii.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.832
Rama Khan's an Earth-Bender.

21:51.875 --> 21:55.444
So he's trying to recreate
Pompeii in National City.

21:55.488 --> 21:56.837
Pompeii times 10,000.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.361
Okay. We need to divide
and conquer.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.581
Supergirl, J'onn, I want you
to get to the Tar Pits,

22:01.624 --> 22:03.060
find Rama Khan and stop him.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.454
You said the Sonic Cannon
defeated him the last time,

22:05.498 --> 22:06.847
so go to the Fortress
and get that.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.631
-Brainy, I need an update on--
-Alex, wait.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.678
I have to tell you something.
You don't have to use Claymore.

22:11.721 --> 22:15.290
We think we can use
Malefic's Q-waves
to counteract Lena's,

22:15.334 --> 22:16.552
stop her using Myriad.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.293
Theoretically, he is correct.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.862
Okay, you want me
to use a known threat
to stop an imminent one?

22:21.905 --> 22:25.387
Handing over a global
Q-wave projector
to a terrorist?

22:25.431 --> 22:28.608
What if Malefic just decides
to change his mind
once we free him?

22:28.651 --> 22:31.393
-He's changed.
-But you don't know
that for sure.

22:31.437 --> 22:36.050
And between Lena and Rama Khan
gearing up for Pompeii 2.0,

22:36.093 --> 22:38.444
the last thing that I need
is a third catastrophe.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.881
We are running out of time.
You need to go.

22:40.924 --> 22:43.449
Alex, please. I know you think
what you're doing is right,

22:43.492 --> 22:45.538
but she is our friend.

22:45.581 --> 22:49.411
If you use Claymore, there's no
turning back from that.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.378
I'll get the Cannon.
I'll meet you at the Tar Pits.

23:04.644 --> 23:07.560
She doesn't understand
how hard this is for me.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.562
I mean, Lena is my friend, too,

23:09.605 --> 23:11.172
and now all of a sudden,
I'm supposed to decide

23:11.215 --> 23:14.436
whether I should risk
everybody's lives
just to save hers?

23:14.480 --> 23:17.483
And Malefic,
he invaded my mind.

23:17.526 --> 23:21.530
He threatened Kelly,
and now I'm just
supposed to trust him?

23:21.574 --> 23:22.923
You know what's on the line.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.577
You're the one who taught me
how to do this job,

23:24.620 --> 23:27.449
and you're the one
who's had to make
really tough decisions

23:27.493 --> 23:28.711
so that people don't die.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.757
You have every reason
to fear my brother.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.890
I can't promise you
that Malefic
has changed for good.

23:35.152 --> 23:38.721
People make mistakes
and they do terrible things.

23:39.592 --> 23:43.465
We have to let them do better,

23:43.509 --> 23:45.162
bring them back into the light.

23:45.641 --> 23:46.729
Otherwise...

23:48.035 --> 23:49.993
what's the point
in trying to save everyone?

23:55.738 --> 23:57.697
The DEO
has sent another warning.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.613
In nine minutes,
our defenses will be disabled.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.266
-Do you want me to--
-Delete it.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.793
What was that?

24:06.836 --> 24:09.317
That felt like
a residual aftershock.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.930
Yes. A 5.4-magnitude earthquake
right in the heart
of National City.

24:13.974 --> 24:16.324
It's knocked the entire
satellite array offline.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.805
There's no way I can
reverse-engineer anything now.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.634
I can still try
a manual override.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.549
I can reposition
the dishes myself.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.202
We discussed this.
Absolutely not.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.596
You could be killed. Both
Hope and Eve gone, forever.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.121
But it would be worth it
for both of us
because I believe in you.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.775
Eve did, too.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.864
I have seen
the depravity of humans.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.867
I have seen
the betrayal and the pain.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.826
Let me help,
so that we can stop them

24:39.869 --> 24:42.219
from committing any more
of these horrible acts
once and for all.

24:42.263 --> 24:45.484
No. I will not allow it.
We will find another way.

24:46.746 --> 24:49.270
Your partnership has meant
the world to me, Hope.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.578
You're the only friend
I can count on.

24:52.621 --> 24:55.624
But, Ms. Luthor,
I'm not your friend.

24:55.668 --> 24:58.366
I'm something you created
to serve a purpose.

25:01.717 --> 25:02.979
You're right.

25:05.547 --> 25:06.940
This is the only way.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.518
Anything on your psychic scan?

25:20.823 --> 25:21.824
Nothing.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.348
Could Brainy have been wrong?

25:29.658 --> 25:30.920
Apparently not.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.686
He's using something more
than earth-bending powers.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.035
You're right.

26:03.474 --> 26:06.739
I see the Shadow and the Staff
in an underground chamber.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.567
-It looks like she's stuck.
-I've got her.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.185
Has Lena responded
to any of our warnings?

26:18.228 --> 26:20.927
None so far. She appears
to be deleting them.

26:20.970 --> 26:23.669
Her auto defenses will be
disabled in five minutes.

26:26.976 --> 26:29.109
If Claymore is launched,
what are our odds?

26:29.152 --> 26:31.851
98% chance Myriad
will be neutralized

26:31.894 --> 26:34.244
and a .01% chance
Lena will surrender,

26:34.288 --> 26:36.725
which makes it
a virtual certainty
Lena will not survive.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.641
-And if we use Malefic?
-Our odds shift slightly.

26:39.685 --> 26:45.821
86% chance we will stop Myriad
and a 0% chance
Lena will be harmed.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.781
Lock Claymore in position,
and prep Malefic.

26:48.824 --> 26:52.306
But, Brainy, you let him know
that if he so much as smiles,

26:52.349 --> 26:55.657
I will have a dozen agents
and their guns
pointed directly at his heart.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.838
It's useless.

27:02.882 --> 27:07.234
The Staff holds me
and it needs me.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.802
Together you're fueling
what he's doing.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.369
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.859
-I'm here, Ms. Luthor.
-Okay, careful.

27:23.903 --> 27:27.210
Now, at the base of the
nearest dish, there should
be an access panel.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.259
It's locked, and the keypad's
rigged to blow.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.956
Damn it, Lex.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.566
We only have three minutes.

27:35.610 --> 27:39.309
Well, it's a group of
satellite dishes
aimed at the sky.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.702
Lex loved symbolism.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.574
Perhaps the code has
something to do with Heaven.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.533
-Or Hell.
-John Milton.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.840
What was Lex's favorite quote
from Paradise Lost?

27:47.883 --> 27:50.451
"Arise or be forever fallen."

27:56.109 --> 27:57.110
It worked.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.026
Manually positioning
the dishes.

28:00.069 --> 28:05.118
Elevation, 14.9.
Azimuth, 253.1.

28:05.161 --> 28:08.948
Ms. Luthor, we are locked
and ready to launch Myriad.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.514
Amazing, Hope. You've done it.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.301
And now, so will I.

28:19.828 --> 28:20.699
Myriad has launched!

28:21.961 --> 28:23.397
Of course it has.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.704
We have 30 seconds until
the first Q-waves reach Earth.

28:29.664 --> 28:30.970
Launch the interception.

28:43.112 --> 28:44.810
Malefic's intercept is working.

28:47.769 --> 28:48.727
Wait.

28:49.466 --> 28:50.641
No, no, no.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.733
No, it's not working.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.997
Malefic's Q-wave energy output
is just shy of the power
we need to stop Myriad.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.999
Is there any way
to up the power?

29:00.042 --> 29:01.914
We can turn off
our Psychic Inhibitors.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.916
-Don't even joke about that.
-I'm not joking.

29:03.959 --> 29:07.789
The Inhibitors absorb
6% of Malefic's energy output,
or 4,000 terawatts.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.618
If we want to increase
his power by the necessary 6%,

29:10.661 --> 29:12.881
we have to remove
the Inhibitors from
the equation. It's basic math.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.275
I will not expose
my agents to that risk.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.799
That assumes there is a risk.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.583
J'onn said
his brother has changed.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.863
Two minutes
until the volcano explodes,

29:37.906 --> 29:39.734
and ten seconds
until Myriad reaches Earth.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.128
Do we turn off our Inhibitors
or do we activate Claymore?

29:42.171 --> 29:45.958
Seven seconds, Director.
Five. Alex!

29:46.001 --> 29:48.090
All agents,
Inhibitors off, now.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.059
What's happening?

30:01.800 --> 30:05.978
See, that's the problem
with you superheroes.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.023
You align yourselves
with the weak.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.895
You fight for these humans,

30:09.938 --> 30:13.986
but time after time,
all they do is destroy
everything around them.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.117
You're one to talk.

30:15.161 --> 30:18.555
Oh, I admit, I destroy.

30:18.599 --> 30:20.514
But with a cleansing fire.

30:20.557 --> 30:23.473
That's the only way to deal
with the scourge of humanity.

30:23.517 --> 30:26.172
I have been here
for millions of years.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.262
It's how it's always been...

30:30.263 --> 30:32.482
and how it always will be.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.150
Supergirl?

30:48.194 --> 30:50.674
Can you hear me?
Mal stopped Myriad.
Where are you with Rama Khan?

30:58.160 --> 30:59.161
Don't you see?

31:00.510 --> 31:02.599
People never change.

31:02.643 --> 31:07.735
No, Rama Khan. You're wrong.
People can change.

31:07.778 --> 31:10.346
That is what is so beautiful
about this world.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.151
You did it.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.370
-You stopped the volcano.
-You knocked his block off.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.852
-No!

31:40.681 --> 31:44.032
They stopped Myriad.
I don't understand.

31:44.076 --> 31:45.599
There's nothing to understand.

31:47.906 --> 31:48.907
I lost.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.388
This is a life lesson to learn.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.175
Sometimes
the good guys don't win.

32:13.627 --> 32:14.628
Enough.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.673
It's over, Rama Khan.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.982
What are you
talking about, Gamemnae?

32:21.026 --> 32:23.985
The planets are still aligned.
There's still time!

32:24.029 --> 32:25.073
Not for you.

32:27.989 --> 32:29.164
Not anymore.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.340
I can still finish this.

32:31.384 --> 32:34.953
You've had your last go.
Your reign is over.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.874
She'll have
something to say about this.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.964
Who do you think appointed me?

32:52.057 --> 32:53.928
This is not over!

33:08.247 --> 33:09.509
I'm sorry I failed.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.121
I wish there was more
I could do for you, Ms. Luthor.

33:13.817 --> 33:14.818
There is.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.046
I see.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.223
Lena Luthor? Hands in the air.

33:28.267 --> 33:32.140
It wasn't her. It was me.
I did all of it.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.794
Drop the gun.
You're surrounded.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.535
Eve, please.

33:42.629 --> 33:43.673
Take her away.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.292
Ms. Luthor, you all right?

33:57.557 --> 33:58.949
You okay?

33:58.993 --> 34:01.996
I'm gonna be scraping mud
out of my cape for a week.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.347
No, I mean, are you okay?

34:06.870 --> 34:07.871
I don't know.

34:08.697 --> 34:11.092
Me neither.

34:11.136 --> 34:16.445
When the FBI went
to arrest Lena,
Eve Tessmacher was there.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.230
She confessed
to the whole thing.

34:18.273 --> 34:23.103
Had proof that
she impersonated Lena.
Had proof for all of it.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.150
I wish that were true.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.889
Well, we recovered Myriad,

34:27.848 --> 34:30.110
but you know Lena.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.199
-She's not gonna stop.
-I know.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.117
She's alive, thanks to you.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.639
Well, and to you.

34:37.684 --> 34:42.514
I mean, you were right
about saving Lena, and Malefic.

34:43.733 --> 34:44.908
He changed.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.781
Well, thank you
for trusting him, and me.

34:47.824 --> 34:51.306
You had a lot more faith
about that than I did.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.569
Well, if we can
save Malefic's soul...

34:54.483 --> 34:56.224
Maybe we can save Lena's.

34:58.183 --> 35:01.447
But that is for another day.

35:01.490 --> 35:03.884
Kelly and I are gonna
get some sushi.
You wanna join?

35:04.493 --> 35:06.234
No, no, you go ahead.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.149
Okay.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.136
I'm Andrea, by the way.

35:38.179 --> 35:40.616
Oh, I know. I'm Russell Rogers.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.315
See you tonight?

35:43.706 --> 35:44.707
Yes.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.362
It's over.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.451
I finally did the right thing.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.889
I'm just sorry
that it's too late.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.068
I wish I could have saved you.

36:26.401 --> 36:28.403
You saved us, Mal.

36:28.447 --> 36:31.450
But how can I ever make up
for what I've done?

36:31.493 --> 36:33.103
If only things were different.

36:34.104 --> 36:36.063
There is a way.

36:36.106 --> 36:38.326
And there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

36:38.370 --> 36:42.722
Her name is M'gann.
She's a friend of mine.

36:42.765 --> 36:45.290
And she's a White Martian
resistance fighter.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.553
She can help you
when you arrive.

36:47.596 --> 36:50.164
Can't believe
the war still rages.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.559
-The war that I helped fuel.
-But you can go home now.

36:53.602 --> 36:56.214
You can help
extinguish those flames.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.306
But what if I can't?

37:01.349 --> 37:03.177
I'm not strong like you, J'onn.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.442
-H'ronmeer never
had a role for me--
-This is your role.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.097
You know the White Martians,

37:10.140 --> 37:12.578
you understand them,
you know how they think.

37:13.318 --> 37:14.449
You can appeal to them.

37:16.016 --> 37:17.670
Malefic, you can
bring peace to Mars

37:17.713 --> 37:19.933
for the first time
in hundreds of years.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.718
We can start anew.

37:22.762 --> 37:27.419
You were never meant
to be the pariah, Malefic.

37:27.462 --> 37:29.334
You were meant
to be the promise.

37:32.467 --> 37:33.990
Thank you, my brother.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.645
I will strive
to make you proud.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.301
And to end what I helped start.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.130
Not without this you won't.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.965
Not a scratch on it.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.054
I'll do my best.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.295
Well done, J'onn J'onzz.

38:19.688 --> 38:22.300
-You passed the test.
-Test?

38:25.607 --> 38:27.696
You released my brother
from the Phantom Zone?

38:28.828 --> 38:30.830
You brought my brother here?

38:30.873 --> 38:33.659
When I saw you fight
in Elseworlds,

38:33.702 --> 38:37.140
I could see that
you were a great warrior,

38:37.184 --> 38:41.580
but one plagued by his past,
and that made you vulnerable.

38:41.623 --> 38:44.409
You believed it was
because you had left Mars,

38:44.452 --> 38:47.673
but it was something
far, far greater, J'onn.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.197
Your brother.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.330
But now that you have
faced those demons,

38:52.373 --> 38:56.899
you have come to learn
your vulnerabilities
are your strengths.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.554
And now you are ready.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.818
Ready for what?

39:04.472 --> 39:05.647
A crisis.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.487
Checkmate. Again.

39:25.275 --> 39:27.539
Finally, you've returned.

39:27.582 --> 39:28.975
I don't know
if anybody's told you this,

39:29.018 --> 39:31.499
but the feng shui of this place
is a bit stale.

39:31.543 --> 39:35.460
I brought you back
because the universe
will need a mind like yours.

39:35.503 --> 39:38.071
Someone who can
checkmate anyone?

39:38.114 --> 39:42.380
The time has come
for you to fulfill
your destiny, Lex Luthor.

39:42.423 --> 39:46.558
You can now become the hero
that you have longed to be.

39:47.689 --> 39:49.387
I've always been the hero.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.695
Happy to help.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.920
But first,
we have to discuss my sister.

40:12.105 --> 40:16.326
For so many years,
I've travelled across worlds,

40:18.677 --> 40:21.070
across the multi-verse,
to do one thing.

40:21.897 --> 40:22.985
To kill you.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.553
And now, we're here.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.774
You saved my life.

40:28.817 --> 40:32.734
Submit
and begin your life anew.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.389
Show me.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.087
The knowledge is within you.
