<i>[male narrator]
Auxilisun meets the high demands
of your busy day</i>

00:38.396 --> 00:41.196
<i>with affordable,
renewable energy.</i>

00:41.198 --> 00:43.232
<i>But it wasn't always
the power choice</i>

00:43.234 --> 00:47.036
<i>for 99% of the world's
governing economic bodies.</i>

00:47.038 --> 00:50.272
<i>Auxilisun was born
from innovation required</i>

00:50.274 --> 00:54.810
<i>after the three-plant meltdown
turned the world away
from nuclear energy.</i>

00:54.812 --> 00:58.814
<i>Oil barons and green extremists
drove energy costs
higher and higher,</i>

00:58.816 --> 01:02.184
<i>resulting
in the energy crisis of 2018.</i>

01:02.186 --> 01:04.253
<i>The world descended into chaos</i>

01:04.254 --> 01:08.223
<i>until Auxilisun introduced
the tri-fission engine.</i>

01:08.225 --> 01:10.225
<i>An Auxilisun
containment facility</i>

01:10.227 --> 01:13.429
<i>was constructed over
the three-plant disaster site</i>

01:13.431 --> 01:17.199
<i>so the tri-fission engine
could clean up
the dangerous radiation.</i>

01:17.201 --> 01:18.634
<i>Progress was slow.</i>

01:18.636 --> 01:20.836
<i>But independent
scientific studies prove</i>

01:20.838 --> 01:24.239
<i>that Auxilisun's
miraculous tri-fission engine
not only worked,</i>

01:24.241 --> 01:28.377
<i>but it also created new energy
from the radiation
it was cleaning,</i>

01:28.379 --> 01:32.347
<i>and thus began
the energy revolution of 2025.</i>

01:32.349 --> 01:36.518
<i>No more dirty biofuels,
inconsistent wind
or expensive solar.</i>

01:36.520 --> 01:38.821
<i>Tri-fission engines
clean up old waste</i>

01:38.823 --> 01:43.525
<i>while Auxilisun continues
to build its next-generation
plants across the world.</i>

01:43.527 --> 01:46.395
<i>Today nuclear energy
powers everything you do,</i>

01:46.397 --> 01:50.232
<i>and Auxilisun is there
to make sure it stays safe,
sustainable</i>

01:50.234 --> 01:52.568
<i>and, most importantly,
affordable.</i>

01:52.570 --> 01:57.172

<i>CSE Dixon,

03:43.647 --> 03:45.547
David, communications
are down

03:45.549 --> 03:47.783
<i>with both
of the field techs--
It's Christmas Day.</i>

03:47.785 --> 03:51.553
<i>Is this something

03:51.555 --> 03:54.590
Gibson Desert North

03:54.592 --> 03:56.358

03:56.360 --> 03:58.393

<i>Something's wrong.
We don't have
anyone available.</i>

04:03.300 --> 04:05.000
<i>I'll go.
What?</i>

04:05.002 --> 04:07.769
You don't have
anyone available.
I'm going out there myself.

04:07.771 --> 04:10.806
Call the transpo.
I'll be ready in ten.

04:22.753 --> 04:25.587
Coming in
on the red zone now.

04:25.589 --> 04:28.957
Completely uninhabitable.
You do not wanna lose
your fuel out here.

05:03.727 --> 05:07.829
So Auxilisun's
sending a tech assistant
to a facility this remote.

05:07.831 --> 05:10.565
No chief engineers
available?

05:10.567 --> 05:12.467
I am
a chief tech engineer.

05:12.469 --> 05:14.469
[chuckles]

05:15.906 --> 05:17.806
How many facilities
you engineered?
None.

05:17.808 --> 05:19.941
I was recently promoted.
My work's been lab-based.

05:19.943 --> 05:21.476
Live view up.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.469
Now, that's what a real-life
Auxilisun containment facility
looks like.

05:47.471 --> 05:50.072
You don't see that
in a lab.

06:10.461 --> 06:12.928
This your first
flight schedule too?

06:12.930 --> 06:15.063
There's nothing in here
about a pickup.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.001
We've lost communication
to Gibson Desert North.

06:20.003 --> 06:23.004
Once I get them back up,
I'll contact Auxilisun HQ
for a pickup

06:23.006 --> 06:25.407
and request
that they don't send you.

The facility itself
is in a state of disrepair,

09:54.251 --> 09:56.618

09:56.620 --> 09:58.753
I will log my entries

There's a scanner.

11:39.122 --> 11:40.722

Just me.

11:42.225 --> 11:44.359
Mm-hmm.

11:44.361 --> 11:47.729
I'll be here long enough

11:50.867 --> 11:52.300

Where?

12:11.354 --> 12:13.488

Mm-hmm.

not a joke.

12:54.297 --> 12:56.464

Did you see me pull
that lever?

13:12.382 --> 13:14.149

you know. I mean--

psychological profiles
to all of our employees

is gonna be back?
I didn't.

19:47.410 --> 19:50.711
Well, you have
to know something
about his schedule.

19:50.713 --> 19:54.482
No. I mean, you know,
he works in a completely
different part of the compound

19:54.484 --> 19:55.616
behind a locked door.

19:55.618 --> 19:57.385
He's the one
with the Ph.D., remember.

19:57.387 --> 19:59.320
I stay out of his way,
take out the trash.

19:59.322 --> 20:01.789
And he just goes out
every now and again?

20:01.791 --> 20:04.392
Look, I'm not the boss.
He is. I'm not his mum.

20:04.394 --> 20:06.561
That's not
what I'm suggesting.
I'm just--

20:08.932 --> 20:11.766
We're almost here.
It's through here
to his lab?

20:11.768 --> 20:13.801
Yeah, yeah.
It's down the end
of this corridor.

20:15.572 --> 20:17.638
Get a chance to, uh,

20:17.640 --> 20:22.777
see Dr. Zek's crazy
scientific experiments up close.

20:22.779 --> 20:24.612
I've read his reports.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.380
There's nothing
in Dr. Zek's work

20:26.382 --> 20:28.549
that is outside
of company parameters.

20:28.551 --> 20:31.219
Oh, yeah?

20:31.221 --> 20:34.555
Why does he do it
all behind a locked door?
Never lets me in.

20:34.557 --> 20:37.225
You're obviously creating
some kind of fantasy.

20:37.227 --> 20:39.460
Is this
the isolation psychosis
you're talking about?

20:39.462 --> 20:40.795
No.

20:40.797 --> 20:43.431
Well, maybe.

20:44.867 --> 20:46.601
Take a look
at his lab.

20:46.603 --> 20:48.669
It'll bore you
to death.

20:54.410 --> 20:56.544
[lock opens]
Just don't touch anything.

21:14.797 --> 21:16.597
Oh.

21:17.533 --> 21:18.833
Wow!

21:19.936 --> 21:23.471
That... is something.

21:23.473 --> 21:26.841
[whirring]

21:29.479 --> 21:31.812
Is this where they
keep all the shit?

21:32.582 --> 21:34.415
The shit?

21:34.417 --> 21:36.384
Nuclear shit.

21:38.288 --> 21:42.290
No. The waste
is kept in Deep Burial,
behind those doors.

21:42.292 --> 21:44.025
You think
this place is impressive?

21:44.027 --> 21:46.360
Deep Burial
is ten times the size.

21:46.362 --> 21:48.062
What's this then?

21:48.064 --> 21:50.765
The cooling system.

21:50.767 --> 21:55.603
Maglev fan built
to last 200,000 years.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.806
But that's nothing
compared to this.

21:58.808 --> 22:02.610
This is the real secret
to Auxilisun's success.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.446
The tri-fission engine.

22:05.448 --> 22:08.683
It takes the energy
from the radioactive decay
in Deep Burial

22:08.685 --> 22:10.051
and powers the fans.

22:10.053 --> 22:11.886
I should have access.

22:11.888 --> 22:14.522
This fan breaks down,
guess who has to fix it.

22:14.524 --> 22:16.390
That's impossible.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.860
If both fans stopped,

22:19.862 --> 22:22.029
then this place
would fill up
with gas so fast,

22:22.031 --> 22:25.733
it would be like
a stick of nuclear dynamite.

22:25.735 --> 22:29.870
And never
in the history of Auxilisun
has even one fan broken down.

22:29.872 --> 22:31.906
It's a brilliant design.

22:31.908 --> 22:36.444
How come
the only access through it
is through this doggy door?

22:36.446 --> 22:39.947
Robotics are
the only thing that can fix
a tri-fission engine.

22:39.949 --> 22:44.418
Even in a hazmat suit,
there's so much radiation,
you'd be dead in 48 hours.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.487
You should know that.

22:46.489 --> 22:48.456
Where's the other fan?

22:48.458 --> 22:50.524
Down in Deep Burial.

22:51.561 --> 22:53.394
We're in the part
of the facility

22:53.396 --> 22:56.530
that needs
"golden ticket" access
to enter.

23:01.971 --> 23:04.672
Just looking.
Okay.

23:04.674 --> 23:08.442
You need
level-14 access to get down
into Deep Burial sites.

23:08.444 --> 23:09.777
Oh.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.079
What are you,
level 18 or something?

23:14.817 --> 23:17.818
When they zap us
with the scanners,
we just get the basic package.

23:17.820 --> 23:21.489
You know.
Office, bedroom.

23:22.658 --> 23:24.592
Shitters.
Did you fix the comms?

23:24.594 --> 23:25.926
No.

23:27.530 --> 23:30.030
All the fuses
and the cabling
are all intact,

23:30.032 --> 23:33.634
so the problem
must be somewhere
between here and there.

23:33.636 --> 23:35.436
Hmm.

23:35.438 --> 23:37.938
You're gonna show me
Deep Burial?

23:37.940 --> 23:39.807
No.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.843
No one goes down
into Deep Burial.

23:42.845 --> 23:44.979
Dr. Zek.

23:46.182 --> 23:48.115
He goes into Deep Burial.

23:49.752 --> 23:51.986
You're mistaken.
I hear him down there
all the time.

23:51.988 --> 23:55.923
Every time he opens that door,
it rumbles the whole facility.

23:55.925 --> 23:57.925
You're wrong.

23:57.927 --> 24:01.562
[chuckles]
You think I'm making this up?
No. I think you're confused.

24:01.564 --> 24:04.865
Dr. Zek doesn't even have
fingertip access
to Deep Burial.

24:07.203 --> 24:08.869
You sure about that?

24:18.080 --> 24:20.514
[coughing]

24:26.656 --> 24:29.190
[coughing continues]

24:29.192 --> 24:30.825
[body thuds]

24:32.061 --> 24:34.195
Robinson?

24:34.197 --> 24:35.796
[clanging]

24:36.899 --> 24:39.467
Jesus! Robinson!

24:40.937 --> 24:43.003
Robinson!
What? Wha--

24:43.005 --> 24:45.139
What?
Are you okay?

24:45.141 --> 24:46.841
You're hitting me.
I'm sorry.

24:46.843 --> 24:49.210
I just fell.
What happened?

24:49.212 --> 24:51.779
[groans]
Just a long day,
you know?

24:51.781 --> 24:53.914
I need some sleep maybe.

24:53.916 --> 24:56.550
Do you generally pass out
when you're tired?

24:56.552 --> 24:58.486
Well, I didn't
really pass out.

24:58.488 --> 25:01.822
I just had a moment of--
What are you doing?
I'm fine.

25:01.824 --> 25:03.991
When was the last time
you requested a medical exam?

25:03.993 --> 25:06.794
I don't need
a medical exam.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.929
[footsteps departing]

25:17.273 --> 25:18.806
Abby Dixon.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.175
Entry 002.

25:21.177 --> 25:23.911
I arrived this morning
to find Dr. Darius Zek,

25:23.913 --> 25:26.847
the chief scientific
executive, absent,

25:26.849 --> 25:28.749
surveying the surrounding area.

25:28.751 --> 25:30.718
But that is unconfirmed.

25:30.720 --> 25:35.222
The facility's caretaker,
Robinson Scott,
was uncooperative.

25:35.224 --> 25:39.760
The comms are still down,
but my preliminary tests
as to why were inconclusive.

25:39.762 --> 25:43.264
I've never seen
an Auxilisun facility
like this.

25:43.266 --> 25:45.833
It's... neglected.

25:45.835 --> 25:48.802
And Robinson Scott--

25:49.839 --> 25:52.006
I don't know
who hired him, but...

25:53.075 --> 25:55.609
[sighs]

26:38.154 --> 26:40.287
[gasps]

26:42.191 --> 26:45.225
[breathes heavily]

27:11.220 --> 27:12.753
[screams]
Sor--

27:12.755 --> 27:14.321
Sorry.

27:26.969 --> 27:30.337
[singing]

27:36.812 --> 27:39.213
-Oi.
-Hmm.

27:39.215 --> 27:41.682
Dodgy lock in there.

27:41.684 --> 27:42.916
Sorry about that.

27:44.687 --> 27:46.220
Can you fix it?

27:47.790 --> 27:51.392
Well, there's no point,
is there, really.

27:51.394 --> 27:53.961
Not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.829
I'm just not used
to having guests.

28:04.373 --> 28:06.974
You carry that thing
everywhere, huh?

28:06.976 --> 28:09.843
I heard you talking
on it last night.

28:09.845 --> 28:12.246
The walls are quite thin.

28:14.050 --> 28:17.317
Well, I gather
information,

28:17.319 --> 28:19.319
report back to Auxilisun.

28:19.321 --> 28:21.889
It's my job. It's protocol.

28:23.926 --> 28:26.393
Is Dr. Zek back?

28:26.395 --> 28:28.162
No.

28:28.164 --> 28:31.065
Is it normal for him
to be gone overnight
like that?

28:32.234 --> 28:33.333
Sure.

28:37.273 --> 28:39.973
Macchiato.
Oh. No, not for me.

28:39.975 --> 28:43.711
That is the world's
greatest macchiato.
You got to try it.

28:46.315 --> 28:47.981
It's hot.

28:49.852 --> 28:52.786
Sugar?
Uh, no.

28:52.788 --> 28:54.288
I'm okay.

28:54.290 --> 28:55.989
Leave her there.

28:55.991 --> 28:57.424
Make me one.

29:00.763 --> 29:03.997
I wanna do a medical
diagnostic test on you.

29:03.999 --> 29:05.799
Medical--
Last night--

29:05.801 --> 29:09.036
No, that thing
last night was fine.
Uh, no.

29:09.038 --> 29:11.371
You can have serious
health problems. Here.

29:21.217 --> 29:25.853
That's very sweet,
but I am fine.

29:25.855 --> 29:29.490
Now I'm fine.
When I was younger,
I had a thing.

29:29.492 --> 29:32.326
My kidneys.

29:32.328 --> 29:34.161
Gone now. I'm fine.

29:34.163 --> 29:38.265
Was it from drinking?

29:38.267 --> 29:41.301
<i>It was cassies mainly.
Some drinking.</i>

29:41.303 --> 29:44.204
I have a sister, Margot.

29:44.206 --> 29:47.808
She was--
She's... your age.

29:48.511 --> 29:50.844
She sobered me up.

29:50.846 --> 29:52.212
Took care of me.

29:52.214 --> 29:55.082
Got me better. Got me off it.

29:56.418 --> 29:59.419
Everyone else left me behind.

29:59.421 --> 30:02.222
She saw me right. I'm fine.

30:03.325 --> 30:04.992
I'm fine.

30:06.862 --> 30:08.095
It's gone.

30:10.466 --> 30:12.432
Don't drink the water.

30:12.434 --> 30:14.968
It's not good.

30:18.440 --> 30:21.842
It's excellent.
You're crazy.
Do you not want yours?

30:21.844 --> 30:23.277
It's all yours.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.512
Two cups of coffee for me.

30:25.514 --> 30:26.980
Watch out.

30:27.983 --> 30:29.516
Cheers.

30:36.892 --> 30:41.228
I was cleaning out
this old guy's place, right?

30:41.230 --> 30:44.398
This was something
that we used to do when they
got kicked out of their places.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.533
And it was something
that I could kind of do

30:46.535 --> 30:49.036
when I was a little high
and stuff, you know.

30:49.038 --> 30:51.138
Easy kind of job to do.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.173
So cleaning out
this guy's place,

30:53.175 --> 30:56.076
throwing away his clothes
and furniture and things
he's not gonna need.

30:56.078 --> 31:00.113
And then I see at one point
he's got a bunch of CD's.

31:00.115 --> 31:02.416
So I'm thinking,
"Oh, that's cool."
Bunch of what?

31:02.418 --> 31:05.452
He has a bunch of CD's.
Um, compound discs.

31:05.454 --> 31:09.256
Uh, compact discs.
You know, the little music.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.225
Little silver
disc things.
Oh.

31:11.227 --> 31:13.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like old
turn-of-the-century music.

31:13.562 --> 31:15.929
And he's got some stuff
that I kind of recognize.

31:15.931 --> 31:17.431
Like Oasis. Remember?

31:17.433 --> 31:19.566
Shed Seven. Um--

31:19.568 --> 31:21.869
[clears throat]
East 17.

31:21.871 --> 31:25.138
So I'm thinking while
I'm cleaning this house out,
I'm gonna play some music.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.940
I'm looking through his music.

31:26.942 --> 31:30.244
"I'm gonna pick that.
I'm gonna pick that."
And this bag falls out.

31:30.246 --> 31:33.580
So I'm thinking,
"Oh, well, you know,
he's kind of hiding that bag."

31:33.582 --> 31:35.983
In this little zip bag.
So what's inside here?

31:35.985 --> 31:38.118
I don't really know that much
about turn-of-the-century music.

31:38.120 --> 31:43.156
Do know a little bit about
retro kind of drugs and stuff.

31:43.158 --> 31:46.493
So I look inside
and there's this--
this crystal,

31:46.495 --> 31:48.128
this rock, you know.

31:48.130 --> 31:51.965
Like, "Hello! Yes.
Know what that is.
Crack cocaine."

31:51.967 --> 31:54.134
So run around the house.
Run around the house.

31:54.136 --> 31:56.270
Like, make sure
I'm kind of safe doing it.

31:56.272 --> 31:59.907
Like, I need, like, a lighter
and a little bit
of aluminum foil

31:59.909 --> 32:02.342
and a little
glass pipe type thing.

32:02.344 --> 32:04.611
Get that all going.
You know, I'll do it.

32:04.613 --> 32:07.114
Put it all in
and break off
a little bit of crack.

32:07.116 --> 32:10.050
Put it in the pipe thing
and then-- [imitating flame]

32:10.052 --> 32:12.619
Kind of fire it up.
Wait.

32:12.621 --> 32:16.290
Nothing. Now, you're
talking about maybe, like,
two, three minutes or so.

32:16.292 --> 32:19.192
You should be off.
You should be, like,
away, doing it.

32:19.194 --> 32:22.329
Nothing. So I think,
"Well, maybe it's like
weak crack or something."

32:22.331 --> 32:25.299
So break off
a little more,
put it in the thing.

32:25.301 --> 32:27.401
Get the lighter--
[imitating flame]
Kind of fire it up.

32:27.403 --> 32:30.370
Nothing. I end up smoking
the whole piece of crack.

32:30.372 --> 32:34.007
That's a lot of crack.
That is a lot of crack.
Nothing.

32:34.009 --> 32:38.578
Like, 20, 25 minutes in,
man, I get pounded
by this, like, headache.

32:38.580 --> 32:41.581
Just like my head
gets filled with cement
or something like that.

32:41.583 --> 32:43.383
Kind of feel a little sick.

32:43.385 --> 32:46.386
The next thing I know,
I pass out on someone else's,
like, floor.

32:46.388 --> 32:48.622
It's not even my house.
I'm out, like this.

32:48.624 --> 32:51.992
And the next thing I know,
the owner of the house,
this old geezer,

32:51.994 --> 32:55.295
the guy whose house
we're clearing out,
like, wakes me up.

32:55.297 --> 32:58.065
So I get roused
and, you know, I look around.

32:58.067 --> 33:00.634
I'm trying to save face
a little bit, but he sees--

33:00.636 --> 33:02.636
He totally sees
what I'm doing.
He can see all the stuff.

33:02.638 --> 33:05.272
You know what he says?

33:05.274 --> 33:09.176
"My grandma
brought that back in 1991.

33:09.178 --> 33:12.312
You just smoked a piece
of the Berlin Wall."

33:12.314 --> 33:14.414
[laughing]

33:14.416 --> 33:17.584
[babbling]

33:17.586 --> 33:19.019
Oh, man. Is that--

33:20.189 --> 33:22.422
Like smoking history
or something.

33:25.194 --> 33:28.195
Went to hospital--
I was in hospital for two days,
on my own.

33:28.197 --> 33:31.164
And then, you know,
ended up my sister came.

33:31.166 --> 33:33.500
Kind of gave me
a little bit of a talking to.

33:33.502 --> 33:36.269
"Clean up your life.
You need to make
some changes" kind of thing.

33:36.271 --> 33:38.505
It's actually
what brought me here.

33:38.507 --> 33:41.575
She kind of--
She and I agreed
to come out here, you know.

33:41.577 --> 33:42.642
[beeping]

33:42.644 --> 33:44.644
What about you?

33:44.646 --> 33:46.446
Me?

33:46.448 --> 33:49.216
Yeah, you know, family.
People you talk to, friends.

33:49.218 --> 33:52.052
No. No. No family.

33:52.054 --> 33:54.221
No family?

33:54.223 --> 33:57.457
You an orphan,
raised by Auxilisun?

34:02.064 --> 34:05.232
No. I mean, uh,
I have a dad.

34:05.234 --> 34:08.768
But-- Technically.
I don't talk to him.

34:10.039 --> 34:11.737
What is this?

34:14.043 --> 34:16.342
I was just trying
to make a friend.

34:18.380 --> 34:22.516
Okay, so...
holidays roll around,
you know, your birthday.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.685
What do you--
Do you go for lunch
on your own?

34:25.687 --> 34:28.688
Play solitaire?
Just nap all day?

34:32.428 --> 34:34.194
I have friends.

34:34.196 --> 34:35.594
You do?
Yeah.

34:35.597 --> 34:37.531
I'm skeptical.

34:37.533 --> 34:41.201
Name them.
Name your friends.
Tesla and Jobs.

34:41.203 --> 34:44.404
What type of names
are those?
That's-- Come on.

34:46.341 --> 34:48.708
They're my dogs.
They--
They're your dogs' names?

34:48.710 --> 34:51.078
[laughs] Come on.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.281
What do you have?
Like little "wee wee wee wee"--
little yappy tiny little things

34:54.283 --> 34:56.750
that fits in a little--
like a little bag of sugar?

34:56.752 --> 34:58.618
This is not adding up.

34:58.620 --> 35:01.354
The becquerel levels
are higher than they should be.

35:01.356 --> 35:04.157
I think
your calibrations are off.

35:04.159 --> 35:08.261
Hmm. Well, maybe someone's
been in Deep Burial. Hmm.

35:09.665 --> 35:12.732
What?
No single person, no one,

35:12.734 --> 35:16.503
not even someone
like Dr. Zek, could
create a spike like this.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.738
I mean, it's got
to be your gear.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.674
It's not calibrated.

35:20.676 --> 35:22.709
I'll leave you to it.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.812
You'll work it out.

35:58.881 --> 36:01.548
Dr. Zek is still missing.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.483
I'm worried about his safety.

36:04.887 --> 36:08.388
And there's... a problem.

36:08.390 --> 36:10.790
According to this data,
the red zone is expanding,

36:10.792 --> 36:12.926
which I know is not possible.

36:12.928 --> 36:16.830
It must be just
a misreading with the gear.

36:16.832 --> 36:20.734
Robinson is not as skilled
as I would expect.

36:20.736 --> 36:24.471
[sighs]
I will recalibrate
the meters myself.

36:30.412 --> 36:33.213
[torch hissing]

36:39.755 --> 36:41.488
[whirring]

37:12.487 --> 37:13.954
[Abby gasps]

37:35.477 --> 37:37.410
[Robinson]
What are you looking at?
[gasps] Jesus!

37:37.412 --> 37:39.679
Oh. Sorry.

37:41.450 --> 37:43.683
I was gonna go on the roof,
hit some balls.

37:43.685 --> 37:46.953
I thought I saw a man
in the desert.

37:48.257 --> 37:50.523
Okay.

37:50.525 --> 37:51.825
May I?

37:53.428 --> 37:54.728
Sure.

38:05.774 --> 38:08.608
Hmm. I don't see
anything.

38:08.610 --> 38:10.577
What if it's Zek?

38:12.514 --> 38:14.848
What if--
What if he's out there

38:14.850 --> 38:16.916
and he's hurt

38:16.918 --> 38:18.985
and he needs our help?

38:23.925 --> 38:26.459
I don't think
Zek's coming back.

38:27.362 --> 38:29.729
He's been gone four days.

38:32.067 --> 38:33.433
No.

38:33.435 --> 38:35.402
You said
he left yesterday.

38:35.404 --> 38:37.504
I didn't say that.

38:40.842 --> 38:42.676
What are you
not telling me?

38:44.079 --> 38:45.845
He kind of lost it.

38:46.748 --> 38:49.382
Sensory deprivation psychosis.

38:49.384 --> 38:50.950
Big time.

38:50.952 --> 38:53.420
I don't know
if it was the isolation

38:53.422 --> 38:56.623
or the tests he was running.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.025
Maybe he was exposed
to radiation in Deep Burial.

38:59.027 --> 39:02.662
But, you know,
he's went a little--

39:04.066 --> 39:06.499
And then
the last night before--

39:07.869 --> 39:10.403
You know, I'm gonna go hit
some balls on the roof.

39:10.405 --> 39:12.739
No. No, listen.

39:12.741 --> 39:15.508
The power lines were
intentionally severed.

39:16.411 --> 39:18.445
He cut them?

39:18.447 --> 39:20.347
Tell me what happened.

39:22.784 --> 39:27.053
You know, most of the time,

39:27.055 --> 39:29.456
just ignore him.

39:29.458 --> 39:33.093
I stay in the control room.
He does what he wants. Fine.

39:33.095 --> 39:35.962
And then before he left,

39:35.964 --> 39:38.898
he just-- Screaming.

39:38.900 --> 39:42.435
Just screaming
down that corridor.

39:42.437 --> 39:45.472
It was getting
louder and louder, at me.

39:45.474 --> 39:48.541
"You did it. You did it.
You broke-- You damaged it.

39:48.543 --> 39:51.010
You broke the fan.
You broke the fan."

39:51.012 --> 39:54.147
He's pointing at me
and accusing me
and shouting.

39:54.149 --> 39:55.982
He's a scary guy.

39:55.984 --> 39:57.884
And I ran.

39:57.886 --> 40:00.387
I ran and I hid.

40:00.389 --> 40:03.456
And I heard
the doors go, up top.

40:03.458 --> 40:05.125
He took the buggy.

40:05.127 --> 40:07.160
I don't-- I mean--

40:07.162 --> 40:10.497
I don't know
how he'd survive
out there.

40:10.499 --> 40:13.867
I mean, I'm telling you,
I saw something.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.902
Yeah, well, you know,

40:15.904 --> 40:17.937
that-- that could be...

40:18.940 --> 40:20.507
this place.

40:23.578 --> 40:25.512
It's the walls.

40:26.047 --> 40:27.614
Ground.

40:28.417 --> 40:29.883
The air...

40:31.987 --> 40:33.953
gets in you.

40:35.490 --> 40:37.524
Hmm.

40:37.526 --> 40:39.793
How have you been sleeping?

40:39.795 --> 40:41.594
You've been dreaming?

40:44.099 --> 40:46.166
Have you
been dreaming?

40:47.068 --> 40:49.068
Hmm.

40:49.070 --> 40:50.136
Hmm.

40:51.473 --> 40:54.741
You can spend
as much time as you want

40:54.743 --> 40:56.476
in that sunroom.

40:57.779 --> 40:59.913
But it gets inside your mind.

41:04.686 --> 41:06.619
I'm gonna go play golf.

44:25.153 --> 44:27.086
Can you hear--
Can you hear me?

44:28.723 --> 44:30.089
Open the door!

44:34.829 --> 44:37.130
<i>[Robinson on comm]
 I'm not sure I should
 override the system.</i>

44:39.401 --> 44:43.436
We're both gonna die if you
don't open this door right now!

of radiation exposure.

45:12.133 --> 45:14.167
We don't have time
to discuss this.

45:16.438 --> 45:18.037
Help me move him.

45:20.008 --> 45:21.908
[golf club clattering]

45:21.910 --> 45:25.078
Go inside. I got him.
I think this is
a mistake, Abby.

Go inside. Go! Go!

45:31.786 --> 45:34.253

What the hell was that?

45:42.297 --> 45:45.164
I'm just following
contamination policy.

45:45.166 --> 45:46.966
It's Dr. Zek.
You don't know
it's Dr. Zek.

45:46.968 --> 45:49.469
You don't.
Who else could it be?

45:49.471 --> 45:52.739
We're in the red zone,
300 kilometers
from the nearest town.

45:55.944 --> 45:57.076
Well?

45:57.078 --> 45:59.045
Yeah, it's Dr. Zek.

46:00.315 --> 46:02.482
How is he?
His pulse is even.

46:02.484 --> 46:04.117
Is it?

46:04.119 --> 46:06.018
He was pretty exposed
out there.

46:06.020 --> 46:07.186
What's that?

46:07.188 --> 46:08.454
Hexomorphone.

46:13.928 --> 46:15.061
Hmm.

46:16.164 --> 46:17.797
Didn't get very far, did he?

46:18.967 --> 46:20.867
I don't know.
Maybe he came back.

46:26.841 --> 46:30.076

What happened to you?

46:42.157 --> 46:44.123
Precaution.
He's dangerous, isn't he?

46:44.125 --> 46:46.359
He's in a coma.

46:46.361 --> 46:48.427
Well, you wake up
from a coma.

46:49.330 --> 46:51.364
Okay.
You need some help?

46:51.366 --> 46:53.466
Why don't you just go back
to the control room.

46:53.468 --> 46:55.868
It's good, you know.
He's back.

46:58.506 --> 47:00.106
That's the important thing.

48:16.918 --> 48:20.353

I was concerned.

48:23.658 --> 48:25.925
It was just a nightmare.

48:25.927 --> 48:27.260
About your dad?

48:29.097 --> 48:31.163

have been off.

It's still--

It's not movin'.

49:30.558 --> 49:32.692
Okay.
[beeping]

49:32.694 --> 49:35.494
I'm gonna check it out.

go back in there?

Huh? What?

[Abby] The fan.

I can't.

I don't have access.
Remember?

51:17.665 --> 51:19.598
What are you
accusing me of?

51:21.702 --> 51:24.203
I'm sorry.

51:24.205 --> 51:26.739
It-- It's not possible

unless somebody
sabotaged the engine room.

It can't happen.

with HQ.

Okay, how serious
is it?

51:43.624 --> 51:45.791
Do we need
to evacuate?

51:45.793 --> 51:48.494
No. As long as
the other fan is up,

51:48.496 --> 51:52.398
it'll take days
before the gases build up
to a dangerous level.

You can't just stand here
all night watching him.

53:06.407 --> 53:07.540
I got this.

53:13.481 --> 53:15.181
He wakes up...

53:16.784 --> 53:18.217
he moves...

53:20.521 --> 53:21.820
call me.

53:23.524 --> 53:26.492
[plays guitar]

53:39.941 --> 53:41.507
[sighing]

53:50.384 --> 53:53.619
[heart monitor beeping]

53:53.621 --> 53:55.521
[clicking, hissing]

54:12.907 --> 54:14.873
-Wha--
-It's-- It's okay.

54:14.875 --> 54:16.308
-What?
-It's okay.

54:17.411 --> 54:19.245
What is this--
What is this place?

54:19.247 --> 54:20.446
Where am I?

54:20.448 --> 54:21.981
You're at Auxilisun
Gibson Desert North.

54:24.485 --> 54:26.018
Gibson Desert North?
Robinson.
He's awake.

54:26.020 --> 54:29.521
Robinson. Robinson?

54:29.523 --> 54:31.357
Oh.

54:31.359 --> 54:33.826
[chuckles] Okay.

54:33.828 --> 54:35.427
Okay?
Thank God.

54:37.531 --> 54:39.932
Wha-- What?
Why am I--

54:39.934 --> 54:43.836
I'm Abby Dixon.
I'm the facilities engineer
from Auxilisun.

54:43.838 --> 54:45.671
I was flown in.

54:45.673 --> 54:47.840
What happened to me?

54:49.577 --> 54:53.512
Just relax, and, uh,
we'll get you up to speed.

54:53.514 --> 54:55.848
-[Zek] Uh...
-Dr. Sale told me
to say hello.

54:58.619 --> 55:00.319
Dr. Jeffrey Sale?

55:00.321 --> 55:03.956
Three years in his class,
and then I was his intern.

55:03.958 --> 55:07.426
He got me my first job interview
at Auxilisun.

55:07.428 --> 55:09.828
[chuckles]
He told me
to tell you hi.

55:09.830 --> 55:13.999
Oh. We haven't talked
since I came here.

55:15.903 --> 55:19.405
Jeffrey and I
got our master's together.
I was in his wedding party.

55:19.407 --> 55:20.806
Yeah.

55:20.808 --> 55:24.710
He's got some very nice things
to say about you.

55:24.712 --> 55:26.679
He made 'em up then.

55:26.681 --> 55:28.781
[laughs]
Well, he says that

55:28.783 --> 55:32.451
you are the most brilliant
nuclear containment scientist

55:32.453 --> 55:34.353
that he's ever had
the pleasure to meet.

55:38.693 --> 55:40.492
[Abby] Here.
[panting]

55:42.630 --> 55:43.929
Hello.

55:43.931 --> 55:45.631
Thank you, Robinson.

55:45.633 --> 55:47.666
You're welcome.

55:47.668 --> 55:49.968
How do you feel?

55:49.970 --> 55:51.737
[handcuffs rattle]
What's this for?

55:51.739 --> 55:54.840
Do you not remember
what happened with the night
that you left?

55:54.842 --> 55:57.343
I can't recall.

55:57.345 --> 56:00.979
-You went a little crazy.
-You had a nervous breakdown.

56:04.885 --> 56:07.653
[Robinson] So that is,
unfortunately, the reason
why you're in handcuffs.

56:07.655 --> 56:10.356
For our safety,
but primarily
for your safety.

56:11.625 --> 56:13.359
Thank you.
You're welcome.

56:13.361 --> 56:15.060
I'm not feeling well.
I'm gonna lie down.

56:15.062 --> 56:16.628
[Robinson]
Yeah, right. Relax.

56:17.865 --> 56:19.865
Do you have a, um,

56:19.867 --> 56:21.667
personal hygiene kit?

56:23.437 --> 56:26.872
I just think... it'd make
Dr. Zek feel a lot better

56:26.874 --> 56:29.675
to not have a week's worth
of desert filth all over him.

56:31.645 --> 56:34.480
-You want me to go get it?
-I'll be fine.

56:34.482 --> 56:35.848
Two minutes.

56:37.685 --> 56:39.651
[door opens, closes]

56:43.090 --> 56:44.690
Dr. Zek?

56:46.060 --> 56:47.693
Is there something
you're not telling me?

56:56.103 --> 56:57.469
Come here.

57:00.574 --> 57:02.941
I have to know
that I can trust you.

57:02.943 --> 57:05.110
Well, of course
you can trust me.

57:05.112 --> 57:06.912
Dr. Jeffrey Sale's son,
tell me about him.

57:06.914 --> 57:09.982
He's in his... 20s.

57:09.984 --> 57:14.086
He just got married.
I haven't actually
met him in person, but...

57:14.088 --> 57:18.590
Tell me the truth
about Jeffrey Sale's son, now.

57:20.494 --> 57:22.428
He's not
Dr. Sale's real son.

57:23.531 --> 57:25.431
[sighs]
His wife was pregnant

57:25.433 --> 57:27.866
when he met her,
but I'm not supposed to
tell anyone that.

57:27.868 --> 57:30.436
Nobody knows that.
I know. I know.

57:30.438 --> 57:31.804
Except people worth trusting.

57:33.474 --> 57:35.641
[sighing] Okay.

57:35.643 --> 57:36.875
That man...

57:37.912 --> 57:39.878
isn't Robinson Scott.

57:41.649 --> 57:42.748
What?

57:42.750 --> 57:44.550
Dr. Zek,

57:44.552 --> 57:46.084
you acted
like you knew him.

57:47.755 --> 57:50.055
Well, I had to.
I'm handcuffed here.

57:50.057 --> 57:54.226
The only reason he's not
killing me is because you think
that he's Robinson Scott.

57:54.228 --> 57:57.095
Okay, look.
The other night,
I was in my lab, alone.

57:57.097 --> 57:59.598
I was working.
And then suddenly,
there was a breach.

57:59.600 --> 58:01.633
And Robinson--
the real Robinson Scott--

58:01.635 --> 58:04.603
he went out to check it out,
and he was obviously
overpowered by this guy.

58:04.605 --> 58:06.638
And then this man,
he found me.

58:08.876 --> 58:10.509
I left Robinson.

58:12.046 --> 58:14.780
So if this isn't...
Robinson Scott,

58:14.782 --> 58:16.782
then how did this person
get here?

58:16.784 --> 58:18.784
We're in the middle
of the red zone.

58:18.786 --> 58:22.154
I have no idea.
He must have been dropped in.
I'm not sure. I don't know.

58:22.156 --> 58:25.657
Do you know anything
about what he wants?

58:25.659 --> 58:27.860
We need to get out of here.
We don't have much time.

58:29.063 --> 58:31.897
So when's your next
scheduled pickup?

58:31.899 --> 58:34.967
I told them
that I'd contact them.

58:34.969 --> 58:36.768
Shit.
Are the comms still down?

58:36.770 --> 58:39.771
Yes,
but the antenna
on your buggy.

58:39.773 --> 58:42.875
I can hot-wire it,
use the universal
comm hub to get a signal.

58:42.877 --> 58:45.244
Good. Then you send out
a Code 7 distress call,

58:45.246 --> 58:48.146
but you can't let him know
that you sent it.

58:48.148 --> 58:51.950
As long as he believes
that you don't know
the truth, we'll be okay.

58:51.952 --> 58:53.151
We will.

58:53.153 --> 58:55.721
And why wouldn't he
just kill us?

58:55.723 --> 58:57.623
And he hasn't tried
to kill you yet?

58:57.625 --> 58:59.091
He needs you for something.

59:01.996 --> 59:05.564
I'm setting up my two-way
tuned into my frequency.

59:05.566 --> 59:07.833
So while I'm gone,
if he comes back,

59:07.835 --> 59:10.569
I'll hear everything
that happens.

59:11.105 --> 59:12.604
Good. Thanks. Abby.

59:12.606 --> 59:13.839
Yeah.

59:14.942 --> 59:16.108
We can do this.

59:39.867 --> 59:42.734
[child giggling]

01:00:42.696 --> 01:00:44.997
<i>[beep]
[Zek on comm]
Abby, he's here.</i>

01:00:44.999 --> 01:00:46.665
<i>He's coming.</i>

01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:53.271
Okay. Here we go.

01:00:53.273 --> 01:00:55.273
Where?

01:00:55.275 --> 01:00:57.709
[chuckles] Where?

01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:30.108
[beeping]

01:01:34.882 --> 01:01:36.415
We have a problem.

01:01:36.417 --> 01:01:38.950
Robinson is not Robinson.

01:01:38.952 --> 01:01:43.021
Somebody broke into
the facility. That's why
Dr. Zek attempted to escape.

01:01:43.023 --> 01:01:45.123
We need help immediately.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.726
So lie back.

01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:50.729
Just lay
your head back.

01:01:54.401 --> 01:01:56.401
There.
Must feel nice.

01:01:58.806 --> 01:02:00.272
Get that desert grime
off you.

01:02:15.355 --> 01:02:17.789
If you just put
your hand down.

01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:24.096
Gotta keep you handcuffed
for your own safety, Dr. Zek.

01:02:24.098 --> 01:02:25.363
I know.

01:02:25.365 --> 01:02:28.467
These razors
are incredibly sharp.

01:02:31.405 --> 01:02:33.939
Try and think

01:02:33.941 --> 01:02:39.044
that you're in
one of those old movies...
in a barbershop.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.887
Where's Abby?

01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:52.057
She went to my office,
to my lab, to get my tablet.

01:02:54.528 --> 01:02:57.395
Just gonna--
Yeah, that looks like
it's gonna work just fine.

01:02:57.397 --> 01:02:59.931
Ah, yeah.

01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:06.905
Okay. I'm actually
gonna have to just lean you
back a little further.

01:03:06.907 --> 01:03:09.207
Just can't quite
reach those--

01:03:09.209 --> 01:03:11.243
Oh, no.
difficult areas.

01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:13.245
You-You don't have to
do my neck.

01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:14.813
<i>[Robinson over comm]
 Relax.</i>

01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:23.955
[Robinson]
Just relax.

01:03:23.957 --> 01:03:25.991
-Robinson?
-Just finishing up here.

01:03:27.094 --> 01:03:29.261
[Robinson]
Much better. Done.

01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:32.864
You do look much better.
Here.

01:03:32.866 --> 01:03:34.866
You forgot my tablet.

01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:37.402
Your lab was such a mess,
I couldn't find it.

01:03:37.404 --> 01:03:39.371
You'll have to give me
better directions.
Oh.

01:03:39.373 --> 01:03:40.505
Yeah, of course.

01:03:48.015 --> 01:03:50.382
[Abby] Dr. Zek,
you've had quite a day.
I know.

01:03:50.384 --> 01:03:52.918
Think you could maybe
use a little rest?

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.586
Hmm?
No, no, no.
I'll give you this to relax.

01:03:54.588 --> 01:03:57.255
I don't-- [exhales]

01:03:57.257 --> 01:03:59.291
-Put him down, Robinson.
-Okay. Just keep an eye on him.

01:04:06.066 --> 01:04:07.866
He was
extremely nervous.

01:04:07.868 --> 01:04:10.168
Well done
for knocking him out
like that.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:13.972
I just thought we would both
sleep a little easier

01:04:13.974 --> 01:04:15.841
knowing that he was
drugged asleep.

01:04:15.843 --> 01:04:17.375
Yeah.

01:04:17.377 --> 01:04:19.911
He doesn't seem
to remember anything.
You believe him?

01:04:21.949 --> 01:04:23.882
Does he seem dangerous
to you?

01:04:25.018 --> 01:04:26.117
Well...

01:04:28.021 --> 01:04:30.455
things aren't always
what they seem.

01:04:30.457 --> 01:04:31.857
Hmm?

01:04:35.362 --> 01:04:38.897
[door opens, closes]

01:05:45.966 --> 01:05:48.934
[snores, groans]

01:06:11.291 --> 01:06:13.725
Shh.
What's happening?

01:06:13.727 --> 01:06:16.294
I had to inject you
to wake you up.
Where's the guy?

01:06:16.296 --> 01:06:19.397
He's sleeping.
We gotta get out of here.
Look away.

01:06:19.399 --> 01:06:21.433
Did you send
the signal?
Not yet.

01:06:21.435 --> 01:06:23.001
That's where we're headed.

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:26.137
[Abby]
We have to get out of here.

01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:30.008
It's gonna take 40 minutes
for them to get here.

01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:31.643
-We'll wait outside. Okay.
-Okay, let's go.

01:06:31.645 --> 01:06:33.979
Too late.
[Abby gasps]

01:06:33.981 --> 01:06:35.714
What are you doing, Abby?

01:06:35.716 --> 01:06:37.682
[Abby] You're not
Robinson Scott.

01:06:38.986 --> 01:06:40.352
What are you talking about?

01:06:40.354 --> 01:06:41.619
-Dr. Zek--
-Stay still!

01:06:41.621 --> 01:06:43.521
Dr. Zek told me--
[Zek]
Abby. Abby.

01:06:43.523 --> 01:06:46.725
The doctor, eh?
You trust the good doctor?
Is that how it works?

01:06:46.727 --> 01:06:51.229
You tell the truth.
You tell her the truth
right now!

01:06:51.231 --> 01:06:52.731
What's he talking about?
The ravings of a madman.

01:06:52.733 --> 01:06:54.733
You tell her about
Gibson Desert North.

01:06:54.735 --> 01:06:57.402
About Auxilisun's
crown jewel, now!

01:06:57.404 --> 01:06:58.636
What?
Tell her.

01:06:58.638 --> 01:07:01.272
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:07:01.274 --> 01:07:03.708
And you're willing to bet
our lives on that, are you?

01:07:05.112 --> 01:07:07.245
-Um, yeah.
-[Abby grunts]

01:07:07.247 --> 01:07:09.547
[Abby shrieks]
Ow! Aaah!

01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:13.184
[Robinson grunts] Aaah!

01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:19.557
[Robinson groaning]

01:07:19.559 --> 01:07:22.260
Let me see.
Am I bleeding?

01:07:22.262 --> 01:07:25.196
Looks like the laser
cauterized the wound.
Come here.

01:07:25.198 --> 01:07:27.465
Aaah!

01:07:27.467 --> 01:07:29.501
[grunts]
To the bed. Here.

01:07:30.604 --> 01:07:33.605
What did he say about me?
[grunts]

01:07:33.607 --> 01:07:35.373
Don't touch it.

01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:40.211
He told me you were
some kind of terrorist

01:07:40.213 --> 01:07:42.747
that broke in here
and killed
the real Robinson.

01:07:42.749 --> 01:07:45.383
You believed him?
Dr. Zek
is a respected member

01:07:45.385 --> 01:07:46.818
of the scientific community.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:50.388
What was I
supposed to think?
Dr. Zek is a lunatic.

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:54.225
How am I gonna get across
the red zone? How am I gonna get
across the size of that desert?

01:07:54.227 --> 01:07:56.428
I'd have radiation poisoning
by the time I got here.

01:07:58.098 --> 01:08:00.065
He destroyed
the door mechanism.

01:08:00.067 --> 01:08:01.099
[door warbles]

01:08:02.402 --> 01:08:04.335
We're locked in here.

01:08:04.337 --> 01:08:07.272
He's gonna escape
without us.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:08:07.274 --> 01:08:08.740
He's not escaping.

01:08:08.742 --> 01:08:10.375
He's going to Deep Burial.

01:08:12.145 --> 01:08:14.245
[Robinson grunts, gasps]

01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:16.781
Bastard.

01:08:18.118 --> 01:08:19.417
Just...

01:08:19.419 --> 01:08:20.819
Hmm.

01:08:22.154 --> 01:08:23.520
What did you mean?

01:08:24.558 --> 01:08:26.658
When you said that--

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.493
that this whole place
was a lie.

01:08:29.496 --> 01:08:31.395
It hurts.
What did you mean?

01:08:33.433 --> 01:08:35.567
This place

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:40.270
is supposed to be a secure
nuclear storage facility.

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:43.140
He's turned it
into a bomb.

01:08:48.314 --> 01:08:49.481
Thanks.

01:08:50.517 --> 01:08:52.283
Abby, I don't--

01:08:52.285 --> 01:08:54.152
I don't know
what we do now.

01:08:54.154 --> 01:08:57.421
How do we get to him?
He's in Deep Burial.

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:03.328
I have access.

01:09:04.598 --> 01:09:07.465
You do?
Yeah.

01:09:07.466 --> 01:09:08.700
That's great.
Hang on.

01:09:11.604 --> 01:09:12.837
Okay.

01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:18.877
I'm gonna rewire
the door

01:09:18.879 --> 01:09:21.578
so the mechanism works
from this side.

01:09:21.581 --> 01:09:23.848
[grunts]
[instrument clattering]

01:09:24.818 --> 01:09:26.317
[Robinson]
You can do that?

01:09:28.721 --> 01:09:30.255
[beeps]
[grunts]

01:09:31.491 --> 01:09:32.756
[Robinson] Nice.

01:09:32.759 --> 01:09:34.893
[Robinson grunts]
Watch out.

01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:39.863
We need to find him.

01:09:41.201 --> 01:09:42.901
I can trace his location
on my tablet.

01:09:42.903 --> 01:09:44.435
No time for that!

01:09:44.437 --> 01:09:45.537
[Robinson]
No time!

01:09:47.506 --> 01:09:49.439
[tablet beeping]

01:10:35.288 --> 01:10:38.389
[gasping]

01:10:38.892 --> 01:10:40.525
Fuck.

01:10:44.531 --> 01:10:47.498
[beeping, whirring]

01:10:53.873 --> 01:10:56.808
-[Robinson grunts]
-[Zek shouting]

01:11:01.982 --> 01:11:04.282
[grunting]

01:11:04.284 --> 01:11:05.783
[gun powers up]

01:11:05.785 --> 01:11:07.652
Drop the club.
Okay, okay.

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:09.821
Who are you?
Okay, okay.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.961
[Robinson, Abby groaning]

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.567
[coughs, retches]

01:11:26.273 --> 01:11:27.872
You're the one
with radiation sickness.

01:11:27.874 --> 01:11:30.008
-You walked across
the red zone?
-Shut up!

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:31.743
-Who are you? Please.
-Shut up.

01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:33.378
Who are you?
Shut up!

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:36.814
Nothing can stop me from doing
what I came here to do!

01:11:36.816 --> 01:11:38.650
Aaah!

01:11:41.888 --> 01:11:43.721
[groans]

01:11:48.962 --> 01:11:51.663
[Klaxon blaring]

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.600
[Abby] Aaah!

01:11:56.970 --> 01:12:00.471
[gun powers up]
What are you doing?

01:12:00.473 --> 01:12:02.640
Gibson Desert North
has been decaying

01:12:02.642 --> 01:12:04.609
at an unpredictable rate
for years, and you knew it!

01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:07.412
You know that
Auxilisun system's fail-safe.
There's no way--

01:12:07.414 --> 01:12:08.613
What about Barrow Creek?

01:12:08.615 --> 01:12:10.548
All of the closest
inhabitable cities

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:12.550
are supposed to be
well within the green zone.

01:12:12.552 --> 01:12:15.920
So unless Barrow Creek--
the entire town--
got up and moved,

01:12:15.922 --> 01:12:17.855
the red zone is expanding.

01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:20.858
Yes.

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860
When were you gonna tell
Auxilisun?

01:12:22.862 --> 01:12:24.495
Auxilisun already knows.

01:12:26.032 --> 01:12:27.332
What?

01:12:28.868 --> 01:12:31.969
Dr. Sale and I
know the truth.

01:12:31.971 --> 01:12:33.971
The truth?
Yeah.

01:12:33.973 --> 01:12:35.940
The truth
that you're killing people?

01:12:35.942 --> 01:12:39.610
The truth is that the energy
we give the world

01:12:39.612 --> 01:12:41.679
is more important than
some piece-of-shit small town--

01:12:41.681 --> 01:12:43.781
But no, people di--
in the middle of nowhere!

01:12:43.783 --> 01:12:45.450
His-- That man's family.

01:12:45.452 --> 01:12:48.720
How many have lived?

01:12:48.722 --> 01:12:52.690
Do you know how many hospitals,
cities, homes use our energy?

01:12:52.692 --> 01:12:56.127
There were 230 assholes
in Barrow Creek!

01:12:56.129 --> 01:12:57.695
Shut up!
[gun powers up]

01:12:57.697 --> 01:12:59.030
Aaah!

01:12:59.032 --> 01:13:00.698
Shut up, okay?

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.500
[gun powers down]

01:13:02.502 --> 01:13:04.569
You can find
your own way out.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.073
[Klaxon blaring in distance]

01:13:10.377 --> 01:13:11.542
[Zek] Abby.

01:13:21.154 --> 01:13:24.489
[child giggling on video]

01:13:34.567 --> 01:13:37.568
[coughs]
So you were the one
that was ruining the fans.

01:13:38.805 --> 01:13:41.973
You walked across the red zone
by yourself?

01:13:41.975 --> 01:13:43.975
How long
have you been dying?

01:13:43.977 --> 01:13:45.576
Not sure.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.781
We all got sick
at the same time.

01:13:49.783 --> 01:13:52.717
I just lasted longer

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:53.985
than Margot...

01:13:55.522 --> 01:13:57.088
and Sammy.

01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:58.856
This won't
bring them back.

01:14:00.493 --> 01:14:02.860
I know what it's like
to lose your family.

01:14:02.862 --> 01:14:05.997
[rumbling]

01:14:09.536 --> 01:14:13.671
Then you know
why I have to do this.

01:14:13.673 --> 01:14:16.741
No. You're just gonna kill
more people. I can't let you--

01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:17.942
Don't follow me, Abby.
Stop.

01:14:17.944 --> 01:14:19.177
Stay back!
Stop!

01:14:19.179 --> 01:14:20.878
No! Stay back, Abby!

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.080
Stop.

01:14:25.051 --> 01:14:28.453
Auxilisun,
they took everything from me.

01:14:28.455 --> 01:14:30.588
If you destroy this place,

01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:32.156
you're no better
than they are.

01:14:32.158 --> 01:14:33.758
And you are?

01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:38.162
[gasping]

01:14:38.164 --> 01:14:41.799
[Abby] No.
[Robinson]
The world needs a tragedy

01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:43.634
-to see
what's been happening here.
-[gun powers up]

01:14:44.904 --> 01:14:47.038
I'll kill you
before I let that happen.

01:14:49.609 --> 01:14:51.142
No, you won't.

01:14:51.144 --> 01:14:54.078
[breathing heavily]

01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:57.582
If we can
get out of here,

01:14:57.584 --> 01:14:59.851
I have all the information
on my ADATA.

01:14:59.853 --> 01:15:02.220
You and I,
we can blow the whistle.
We can let everybody know.

01:15:02.222 --> 01:15:04.856
No, Abby.
They'll shut you down, Abby!

01:15:04.858 --> 01:15:06.824
This thing's bigger than you!

01:15:07.694 --> 01:15:09.694
The whole world, Abby!

01:15:09.696 --> 01:15:11.596
They're being lied to!

01:15:13.066 --> 01:15:15.933
Is this what Margot
and Sammy would have wanted?

01:15:19.572 --> 01:15:20.705
Not sure.

01:15:21.941 --> 01:15:23.207
I don't know.

01:15:26.713 --> 01:15:28.713
Maybe I'll get a chance
to ask 'em.

01:15:28.715 --> 01:15:29.847
No!

01:15:42.595 --> 01:15:44.061
[electricity crackling]

01:15:44.063 --> 01:15:46.998
[Klaxon blaring]
[rumbling]

01:16:27.173 --> 01:16:30.575
This is CTE Abby Dixon
to Auxilisun tri-copter.

01:16:30.577 --> 01:16:31.842
Rhine, do you read me?

01:16:35.915 --> 01:16:37.882
[explosions]

01:16:47.293 --> 01:16:49.760
[explosions, rumbling continue]

01:16:49.762 --> 01:16:52.763
[panting]

01:16:59.238 --> 01:17:01.606
[explosion]

01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:12.783

[respirator hissing, clicking]

01:18:04.437 --> 01:18:06.404
