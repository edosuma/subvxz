WEBVTT

00:17.717 --> 00:20.452
Ooh, the female reproductive
system.
- Kind of looks
like the Chicago Bulls symbol.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.122
It does.
Now, this is the only part
that matters.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.124
The money train. Sure.
Hey, I call it my nine-to-five.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.626
'Cause it's my job to work it.
You know what I'm saying?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.395
(laughter)

00:29.397 --> 00:31.397
The large intestine,
you degenerates.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.998
What?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.066
Let me see that.
I told Jess

00:34.068 --> 00:36.035
that I don't want
to teach health.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.137
I'm not good at it.
Such a hassle.

00:38.139 --> 00:42.241
Studying, planning, giving
weak kids good grades. No.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.843
I heard that. There are good
things, too. Like you get

00:44.845 --> 00:48.347
to come with me to a
dope two-day teaching
conference in Palmdale.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.216
I want to stay and hang out
with the guys at Guys' Night.
What's Guys' Night?

00:51.218 --> 00:52.985
Oh, yeah, we're celebrating
you being gone. No offense.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.186
Guys' Night!
Guys' Night!

00:54.188 --> 00:56.355
Guys' Night!
Guys' Night!

00:56.357 --> 00:57.856
The conference is gonna be
really fun. We just have

00:57.858 --> 01:00.559
to work from,
like, 9:00 to 7:00.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.661
And then after that
it's a par-tay.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.364
Until 10:00, when quiet hours
are strictly enforced.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.599
But before then we rage.
For three hours.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.602
Actually, two because there's
the half an hour of setup time

01:10.604 --> 01:13.238
and the half an hour of cleanup
time because we have to actually

01:13.240 --> 01:15.174
be in bed at 10:00.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.742
CECE:
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:16.744 --> 01:18.343
Are you kidding me?

01:18.345 --> 01:20.612
Ryan is going?

01:20.614 --> 01:23.449
Ryan-Ryan? The guy you
have a crazy crush on?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.451
I had a crush on him.
Principal Foster

01:25.453 --> 01:29.021
says that administrators can't
date teachers. It's forbidden.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.856
That makes it so much hotter.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.125
It makes it crazy hotter.
But, look,

01:33.127 --> 01:34.793
it's not just
about Principal Foster.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.095
This is
about how I worked

01:36.097 --> 01:37.796
really hard to get
to Vice Principal,

01:37.798 --> 01:40.599
and I'm not gonna let
some British guy get in my way.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.201
Some redcoat bastard.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.535
That's why
I keep all

01:43.537 --> 01:46.205
of our interactions
strictly professional.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.240
Hey. How was
your weekend?

01:48.242 --> 01:50.609
That's personal.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.078
I can't risk learning
any personal details about him.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.981
What if he taught
his dyslexic sister how to read?

01:55.983 --> 01:58.550
I can't know that.
I'll go crazy with lust.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.819
My pants will turn to ash.
And so exactly

02:00.821 --> 02:03.155
how do you plan
to avoid this man

02:03.157 --> 02:05.157
that you are trapped
in the same hotel with?

02:05.159 --> 02:07.759
There are, like, a thousand
porns that start that way.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.228
Yeah, but no porns
have teachers.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.462
Every porn has a teacher.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.064
Well, I'm not worried, okay?

02:12.066 --> 02:14.399
'Cause I'll probably
never even see him.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.568
Jess?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.570
Can you believe we're
right next to each other?

02:29.482 --> 02:30.849
Hey, you guys want sangria?
NICK:
It's Guys' Night!

02:30.851 --> 02:34.286
Only beer!
Yeah, what is
this, Spain?

02:34.288 --> 02:35.921
Great sangria burn, man.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.456
Really?
- Never let
your guard down!

02:37.458 --> 02:39.258
Aah!
- Oh, takedown!

02:39.260 --> 02:40.792
Never let your guard down.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.127
Well played.
All right, first up,

02:42.129 --> 02:43.862
we eat meat.

02:43.864 --> 02:44.696
How much meat?!

02:44.698 --> 02:45.998
Then we take a fart nap.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.533
Not for me. Pass.
All right, guys,

02:47.535 --> 02:49.535
it's Guys' Night.
Let's think.
- Okay.

02:49.537 --> 02:53.605
Anything else we can't
do when Jess is here.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.873
Wow.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.342
Look at that stretching.
I don't want to...

02:57.344 --> 03:01.313
make this sound too creepy,
but I want to own those girls.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.648
I wouldn't touch
them. They'd want

03:02.650 --> 03:04.616
for nothing. But I would know
they were there.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.685
Stretching. For me.
- I want

03:06.687 --> 03:08.287
to French braid that girl hair.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.122
I want to French braid
that hair so good.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.191
The third hottest one
just waved at me.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.458
Hello! Ah!

03:13.460 --> 03:14.159
Ooh!
- Oh, no.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.194
Oh!
- No!

03:15.196 --> 03:16.628
No, no, no!
- Oh...

03:16.630 --> 03:17.963
Jess is gonna kill you.
- Shoot!
She's not gonna kill me.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.298
I'm just gonna, I'm
gonna, I'm gonna have

03:19.300 --> 03:20.499
it cleaned, I'll
have it cleaned.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.534
Schmidt, red wine sets.
Shut up, Winston! It sets.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.336
Why don't you
just wash it?
Why don't I just what?

03:24.338 --> 03:25.537
Wash it.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.105
Just wash the blanket.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.841
Unless you can't.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.743
Come on, man.
Get out of here.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.145
I've known you
for a lot of years

03:33.147 --> 03:34.413
and I've never seen you
do laundry.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.647
Never seen me do laundry...
Get out of town.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.316
Wait, wait.
Is that true?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.383
Come on, you guys,
this is so...

03:38.385 --> 03:39.418
Really, this is silly.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.652
Then do it.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.887
Right now.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.088
We'll watch.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.791
Doing the
laundry...

03:46.726 --> 03:48.660
It's no
problemo.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.929
Little bit
of this.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.204
What in the
world...?

03:59.206 --> 04:00.572
Straining the soap.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.509
Get that
in there.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.546
Back in there.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.981
Um, okay.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.485
And...

04:14.687 --> 04:16.955
That's it.
Laundry.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.290
Can't...
Oh, so silly.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.591
Forgot to put
the quarters in.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.993
That's right, the quarters.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.468
Schmidt...
All right!
I don't know how to do laundry!

04:29.470 --> 04:30.602
I knew it!
- Forget it.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.937
Finally!
- That is
insane!

04:31.939 --> 04:33.405
Hope you're happy.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.407
Nerd. Nerd.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.608
Dud.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.810
Lady nerd.
Goofus.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.213
Virgin...
- Hey, Coach, I need
you to be my buffer!

04:41.215 --> 04:43.282
Okay, but Nick can never
find out about this.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.816
Wait, what?
- Hmm?

04:44.818 --> 04:46.718
What?
- What are you
talking about?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.220
What are you
talking about?

04:48.222 --> 04:50.422
I need you to be my buffer
between Ryan and me.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.590
He's so sexy.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.424
Really?
- Yeah.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.392
That guy?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.893
Beautiful.
Did you make that?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.495
Looks like a Boys
Department mannequin.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.896
Yeah.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.465
Hey, Jess, can I, um...
- Nope.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.466
No time for chatting.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.834
We have to sit down.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.437
You can't
sit there.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.805
Coach likes to sit
in the middle.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.106
Mm-hmm.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.609
I sit bitch
or I don't sit at all.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.744
(whispering): You're weird.
(whispering):
You're weird.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.179
COACH: You're a weirdo.
You're weird.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.847
You're weird.
- You're weird.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.985
Shh.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.587
I am education guru
Brenda Brown.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.790
COACH:
Oh, no. Who is this?
She looks like

05:24.792 --> 05:26.858
one of those ladies who talks
you into having a baby in a tub.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.493
You. The talker.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.395
Mmm...
Stand up.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.801
Talk to us.
There were other people talking,

05:35.803 --> 05:37.636
I just want to
let you know that.
Why are you a teacher?

05:37.638 --> 05:38.837
Uh, 'cause my...

05:38.839 --> 05:40.439
my roommate made me.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.774
Hmm.

05:42.776 --> 05:43.975
What?

05:43.977 --> 05:45.177
I'm worried about you.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.445
You're a worry.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.313
Wor... why, why are you
worried about me?

05:48.315 --> 05:50.949
Teaching is an awesome

05:50.951 --> 05:52.651
responsibility.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.720
You are not prepared for it.
Sit down.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.055
Okay.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.124
Today, we will learn

05:59.126 --> 06:00.492
about our fellow educators,

06:00.494 --> 06:02.027
their hopes, their dreams,

06:02.029 --> 06:03.895
their bitter
regrets.

06:03.897 --> 06:07.032
The things they wish they'd said
to their birth mother...

06:07.867 --> 06:09.334
So, partner up.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.969
Will you be
my partner?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.671
Mmm, sorry,
I'm with Coach.

06:12.673 --> 06:13.872
No, I can't do it.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.307
I'm going to the bar.
- What?

06:15.309 --> 06:17.075
Buffer out. Buffer out.
No, buffer in.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.144
Buffer in. Buffer in.
- Buffer out.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.512
Everything okay here?

06:20.514 --> 06:21.847
Yeah, sorry.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.148
My, um... my partner just left.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.318
Or... did your partner
just arrive?

06:26.320 --> 06:28.153
Oh. Um...
No...

06:28.155 --> 06:30.055
Wicked.
BRENDA:
Everyone!

06:30.057 --> 06:33.325
Look at your partner,
really look.

06:33.327 --> 06:36.061
Take his or her hand and say,

06:36.063 --> 06:37.329
"I'm excited!"

06:37.331 --> 06:39.798
I'm excited.
- Oh, crap.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.303
(knocking at door)

06:46.606 --> 06:47.839
We just came
to say we're sorry.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.342
Guess you think
I'm pretty dim, huh?

06:50.344 --> 06:52.043
A man who can't do laundry.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.745
You weren't born
this way, were you?

06:54.881 --> 06:56.882
Born not knowing
how to do laundry?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.383
Like everyone else?

06:58.385 --> 07:01.086
Yes, Winston, I was.
It wasn't till after birth

07:01.088 --> 07:03.188
that the trouble really began.
Here we go.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.357
SCHMIDT:
<i>Nana wouldn't let me</i>
<i>in the laundry room.</i>

07:05.359 --> 07:07.292
<i>I think it's because my hands</i>

07:07.294 --> 07:08.894
<i>were always covered in butter.</i>

07:08.896 --> 07:11.296
<i>And so I went to college</i>
<i>unable to do laundry.</i>

07:11.298 --> 07:13.799
I'm making jean shorts!
I'm doing laundry!

07:13.801 --> 07:15.967
Big night for both of us!
Yeah, it is.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.803
<i>As I pulled out</i>
<i>my maternity corduroys,</i>

07:17.805 --> 07:20.539
<i>I spied a six-pack</i>
<i>of Pi-Phis.</i>

07:20.541 --> 07:22.808
I need... um...

07:22.810 --> 07:24.109
I need them loose to keep...

07:24.111 --> 07:25.544
to keep my sperm count up.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.078
You know how it is!

07:27.080 --> 07:29.648
Eventually, the window of time
when it was acceptable

07:29.650 --> 07:32.117
to learn something
so basic had closed.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.819
I was an adult.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.820
It was too late.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.788
Well, I understand.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.790
You know, I've never
told anyone this,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.091
but, um...

07:40.093 --> 07:41.760
I don't know how
to read a ruler.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.662
I don't, I mean,
how do you start?

07:43.664 --> 07:45.430
At the edge or
the first tick?

07:45.432 --> 07:47.132
It's confusing to me.
Are you serious?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.733
Do you know how to count?
It always gets on top of me,

07:48.735 --> 07:51.436
and I can't...
'Cause then you should know
how to use a ruler, you idiot!

07:51.438 --> 07:53.004
I'm an idiot? You can't even
wash your own underwear,

07:53.006 --> 07:54.105
you dumbass.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.074
Hey! They're both super easy!

07:56.076 --> 07:57.976
We're talking about
laundry and a ruler!

07:57.978 --> 08:00.612
I'm gonna teach
you guys right now!

08:00.614 --> 08:01.813
Let's go.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.648
Each of you holds
a stack of cards

08:03.650 --> 08:05.150
with questions
for your partners.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.687
You must uncover the answers.
Begin.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.188
What gets you out of bed
in the morning?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.356
Let me guess.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.658
Your mother,
who you live with, says,

08:13.660 --> 08:15.527
"Ryan, your crumpets
are getting cold."

08:15.529 --> 08:17.829
The thought that
any ordinary day could be

08:17.831 --> 08:19.998
the day I look back on
when I'm much older

08:20.000 --> 08:21.266
as being the best day
of my life.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.434
You?

08:22.436 --> 08:25.504
Same.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.838
Don't look away.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.173
Embrace the intimacy...
I'm good.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.942
Embrace the intimacy.
Okay.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.711
You know, I think there's
an art to a picnic basket.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.280
Apricot jam would never go
with a sesame cracker.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.148
Of course it wouldn't,
it would go with
Yeah, it'd go with

08:37.150 --> 08:39.851
BOTH:
a flaky baguette.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.720
Duck, duck. Okay, now
step forward, step forward,

08:41.722 --> 08:44.189
another step forward; okay, go
to your right, go to your right.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.190
Do you scrapbook?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.359
On rainy days.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.127
Step forward, go to your left;
left, left.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.195
Big step, that's it, big step;
now come

08:50.197 --> 08:51.730
to me, another big step;
come to me.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.198
Do you own yarn?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.199
Spools of it.

08:54.201 --> 08:58.870
I craft so much.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.505
It's a left, and again come
to me, come to me.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.040
Yes.
- Come to me.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.109
Oh! (shouts)
- Oh!

09:06.712 --> 09:08.680
It's okay, I've got you.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.048
We have a new record.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.018
He's amazing.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.519
I think he might be an angel

09:14.521 --> 09:16.054
sent down to Earth
like Denzel Washington

09:16.056 --> 09:17.222
in<i> The Preacher's Wife.</i>

09:17.224 --> 09:18.924
Oh, honey, okay, what can I do?

09:18.926 --> 09:20.025
In your purse,

09:20.027 --> 09:22.694
you will find a white envelope.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.529
Okay, you, you wrote
a letter to yourself,

09:24.531 --> 09:25.897
and stuck it in my purse?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.432
Read it, I need to hear it.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.833
"Dear Jess,

09:28.835 --> 09:30.101
"If you are reading this,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.903
"it's because you're
being an idiot

09:31.905 --> 09:34.039
"and developing feelings
for your employee,

09:34.041 --> 09:37.909
you ballet-flat-wearing
piece of Oregon trash."

09:37.911 --> 09:39.010
You are so right.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.378
You are<i> so right.</i>

09:40.380 --> 09:42.047
"To have intercourse
with the first man

09:42.049 --> 09:43.615
"hired under your reign

09:43.617 --> 09:45.951
would be an insult
to yourself and also..."

09:45.953 --> 09:47.352
This part's in caps.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.354
"...all women everywhere."
All women everywhere.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.057
"Did you learn nothing
from the movie<i> Elizabeth,</i>

09:52.059 --> 09:54.092
you stupid little bitch?"

09:54.094 --> 09:56.695
No one respects a queen
who sleeps with her subjects.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.463
I will paint my face white.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.598
No man may have me.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.632
Thank you, Cece.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.766
You're welcome?

10:01.768 --> 10:05.070
Teaching is such
a pain in the ass.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.571
Isn't it?

10:06.573 --> 10:07.906
I'll tell you what,

10:07.908 --> 10:09.541
I wouldn't give it up
for anything.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.476
You get to really impact
those kids' lives.

10:11.478 --> 10:14.813
I'm not gonna impact them,
I'm just teaching health.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.981
"Just health"?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.549
Hey, Carol.
- Hey, Ned.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.417
Oh, it's Carol.
- Oh, hey, Carol.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.119
Health is the most
important subject.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.221
Screw up, and they
"just" get pregnant.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.256
What's your safe
sex lesson plan?

10:25.258 --> 10:26.658
I don't know!

10:26.660 --> 10:29.260
Uh, lie to them
and say condoms feel good?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.329
Uh, maybe tell them
about my buddy

10:31.331 --> 10:33.064
who's got bumps on his thing?

10:33.066 --> 10:34.499
Maybe bring up
Magic Johnson.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.167
Maybe bring up
Kobe Bryant.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.003
You're my best friend
in the whole world,

10:38.005 --> 10:40.472
but I'm really worried
about you.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.278
You think the line is
a suggestion?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.514
I don't know what it is...
It isn't!

10:51.083 --> 10:52.651
Do it again.
- It's too hard!

10:52.653 --> 10:53.685
Do it again!

10:53.687 --> 10:55.453
Okay, so you start
with the first tick.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.288
Oh...

10:57.290 --> 10:58.957
That's it, really.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.392
Stop!

11:01.661 --> 11:02.861
That was at the line!

11:02.863 --> 11:04.129
That was perfect.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.463
Now do it
ten more times.

11:05.465 --> 11:08.033
So in the beginning,
you never mind the edge.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.834
Yeah.
Man.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.803
You got to hold on
to it.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.873
What about bleach?
Let's walk before
we can run, huh, pal?

11:14.875 --> 11:17.542
Hey, Winston,
he's asking about bleach!

11:17.544 --> 11:19.978
(laughs)
Man, that is way too soon.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.347
Warm-warm, warm-cold...
You got this,
don't get flustered!

11:22.349 --> 11:24.516
Cold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot?
It's hot-hot!

11:24.518 --> 11:26.885
It's always warm-cold.
Well, what's "permanent press"?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.486
Fake button, nobody uses it.
Yeah, don't press that one.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.955
(buzzing)
- The machine is buzzing,
you didn't close it!

11:30.957 --> 11:32.157
What?! Yeah, I closed it!

11:32.159 --> 11:33.358
Who you gonna believe,
me or the machine?!

11:33.360 --> 11:34.359
I'm gonna believe the machine!

11:34.361 --> 11:35.860
(grunts)

11:35.862 --> 11:37.662
This is bull!

11:37.664 --> 11:39.864
(buzzing stops)

11:39.866 --> 11:41.066
Damn it, you!

11:41.867 --> 11:43.868
We're so close.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.336
Take ten and relax.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.905
Nine-inch bottle.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.339
Rappers be lying.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.674
You told me to
relax, so...

11:49.676 --> 11:51.309
Self-pleasure is the only thing
that relaxes me.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.144
Ugh. Seriously, Schmidt?
That is crass.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.681
I don't want to hear it,
I don't want to hear it.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.116
So stupid.

11:59.185 --> 12:02.053
Hey, you did it!

12:02.055 --> 12:03.021
You did it!

12:03.023 --> 12:03.922
Yes!

12:03.924 --> 12:05.690
Yes... yeah!
- (whoops)
- All right!

12:05.692 --> 12:07.258
That's what I'm talking about!

12:07.260 --> 12:09.294
Guys' Night!

12:09.995 --> 12:11.896
Hey.
- Oh, hey.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.566
I saved you a seat.
- Oh! No.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.770
I've been offered a seat
at the higher-ups' table.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.606
The tastemakers.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.542
You're not invited.
- Oh, I see.
You're back to avoiding me.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.711
I'm not av... I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.446
Yes, you do. You've been
avoiding me for weeks at school.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.714
That's why I
was so happy

12:29.716 --> 12:31.516
that we were finally
getting a chance to,

12:31.518 --> 12:33.585
I don't know, maybe get
to know each other.
What, is this summer camp?

12:33.587 --> 12:36.387
We don't need to get
to know each other.
What's your problem with me?

12:36.389 --> 12:38.556
Did I do something
to offend you?
- Why do... I...
I don't have a problem.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.725
You have a problem with me.
(mimicking):
I don't have a problem with you.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.427
Yes, you do, you have a problem.
Do<i> you</i> have a problem?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.595
No, I don't have a problem.
Great, then we both

12:43.597 --> 12:45.930
don't have a problem.
We have a problem.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.299
COACH:
Hey, Jess!

12:48.301 --> 12:50.702
Buffer on the roof!

12:50.704 --> 12:51.936
(laughs)

12:51.938 --> 12:53.238
I'm freaking out.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.607
Freakin', freakin' out.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.041
Freak, freak, freak.
(dog barks)

12:57.043 --> 12:59.844
Is that a baby?
I feel like I hear a baby.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.649
All right, gentlemen--
bar crawl.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.651
Man, look at this,
I know how to do laundry!

13:06.653 --> 13:08.586
I feel like a new man.
Good, good, good.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.455
There is no way for me
to express my joy.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.724
Except by telling you
the width of my smile.

13:12.726 --> 13:13.758
(giggles)

13:13.760 --> 13:15.560
(chuckles)

13:15.562 --> 13:17.395
I can't read it,
somebody else read it.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.798
No, I want to do it,
I want to do it, hold on.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.167
But I can't see,
let me turn it... uh...

13:22.169 --> 13:23.768
You know what? To Nick.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.503
What can't you do?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.305
A lot, you know,
I can't say "Frebuary."

13:27.307 --> 13:29.107
(laughs)
No one can!

13:29.109 --> 13:31.009
Frebuar...
Febuar-ar...

13:31.011 --> 13:32.777
Feb.. I... (babbles)
Whatever.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.412
Feb... February.
Yeah, it's February.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.281
I can't say the alphabet
unless I'm singing the song.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.149
And I never learned how to love.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.851
But enough about me...
Guys' Night!

13:39.853 --> 13:40.819
Let's go, gentlemen.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.353
WINSTON:
Man, that is...
that is heavy.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.789
Hey, Nick, that's
something we should talk about.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.291
I mean, what are we gonna do,

13:46.293 --> 13:48.293
sit around all night
and talk about love?

13:48.295 --> 13:50.461
(laughs)

13:50.463 --> 13:54.666
WINSTON AND SCHMIDT:
¶ I want to know what love is ¶

13:56.302 --> 14:00.271
¶ I want you to show me ¶

14:00.273 --> 14:02.340
¶ Ooh... ¶

14:02.342 --> 14:05.476
¶ I want to know what love is ¶

14:05.478 --> 14:06.678
¶ Oh... ¶

14:06.680 --> 14:08.680
¶ And I want you
to sh... ¶

14:08.682 --> 14:11.449
FOREIGNER:
¶ I know you can show me ¶
Sad song.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.717
Hey, buddy.

14:12.719 --> 14:13.685
Hey!

14:13.687 --> 14:15.153
JESS:
What's happening?

14:15.155 --> 14:16.955
I freaked out about the
whole teaching health thing,

14:16.957 --> 14:20.625
and then I went and I-I
got drunk with Ned...

14:20.627 --> 14:21.893
Neddy!

14:21.895 --> 14:22.861
And then I bet

14:22.863 --> 14:24.562
everybody in the bar

14:24.564 --> 14:26.497
that I could do a backflip
off the roof,

14:26.499 --> 14:28.666
and that's what I came to do.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.901
So...

14:29.903 --> 14:31.636
Hey, look, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.705
Uh, I...
- I totally understand
how you're feeling.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.973
Yeah? Does, uh, teaching

14:34.975 --> 14:36.574
scare the crap out of you, Jess?

14:36.576 --> 14:37.976
Well, it is my life's calling,

14:37.978 --> 14:39.510
so, no.
- Exactly.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.313
You don't get it.
I do.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.582
What's up, player?
It's the British dude.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.918
This is my first time teaching,
and I'm scared, too.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.020
It's a terribly important job.
Yeah, but health

14:49.022 --> 14:50.355
is the most...
(all gasping)

14:50.357 --> 14:51.389
I'm good.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.991
Health is the most important

14:52.993 --> 14:54.559
subject on Earth.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.827
Yes, it is
important.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.428
'Cause you know kids,

14:57.430 --> 14:59.163
they're always wanting to have
sex with each other.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.832
They don't know that it
just feels good for a second

15:00.834 --> 15:02.166
and then you're sad.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.269
And that's why we
need someone great,

15:04.271 --> 15:06.504
someone strong,
who the kids trust.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.672
Okay.

15:07.674 --> 15:08.940
Someone who can yell at them

15:08.942 --> 15:10.241
about chlamydia.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.510
That does... that sounds like...

15:12.512 --> 15:13.878
like something Coach would do.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.381
You can teach.
- I can teach, guys!

15:16.383 --> 15:17.682
That's mostly what I
was trying to tell you.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.118
No one needs to worry
about me anymore!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.887
No!
(all screaming)

15:22.889 --> 15:24.589
Oh, my God.
- I'll get him.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.457
No.
- Yes.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.226
Don't do anything heroic
right now. Oh!

15:28.228 --> 15:31.029
(all gasp, exclaim)

15:38.137 --> 15:39.804
(gasping for air)

15:39.806 --> 15:43.107
(cheering)

15:43.109 --> 15:46.277
This guy's
amazing.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.782
NICK, WINSTON AND SCHMIDT:
¶ Hello ¶

15:50.784 --> 15:55.053
¶ Is it me you're looking for? ¶

15:55.055 --> 15:57.622
¶ I can see it in your... ¶

15:57.624 --> 15:59.457
I want to be the someone

15:59.459 --> 16:01.492
that somebody is looking for.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.895
¶ In your smile... ¶
But what do I have to offer?

16:03.897 --> 16:05.763
Do not talk about
yourself like that.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.398
Come on, guys, what do
I bring to the table?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.433
That's easy, man.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.600
You're the cute one.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.668
What?
- SCHMIDT:
That's right.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.936
Look, I'm the smart one,

16:11.938 --> 16:13.404
Winston's the silly one,

16:13.406 --> 16:15.506
Coach is the sports one,
and you're the cute one.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.941
Well, if I were so cute,

16:16.943 --> 16:18.343
then how come I can't find
anyone to love?

16:18.345 --> 16:20.011
'Cause you're
aiming too low.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.780
Nick, my man, you don't
find diamonds underground.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.350
That's exactly where
you find diamonds, Winston.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.684
Let's...
can we not...

16:26.686 --> 16:28.953
This is not
about gems, okay?

16:28.955 --> 16:31.189
This is about Nick
valuing himself

16:31.191 --> 16:32.924
enough to aim
for the top.

16:32.926 --> 16:35.593
Now, I-I've been to the top
of the mountain, with Cece,

16:35.595 --> 16:37.095
and it was glorious
up there.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.297
And you know, one of these
days-- could be tomorrow--

16:39.299 --> 16:40.832
I'm gonna be
a millionaire.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.967
If I don't have Cece,

16:42.969 --> 16:44.435
then what<i> do</i> I have?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.437
You got a million dollars.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.639
If I'm being honest,
you guys, uh...

16:48.641 --> 16:50.308
I'm worried about being a cop.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.943
Sure.
- WINSTON:
You know, what if
I see something

16:51.945 --> 16:53.845
really bad and then it...

16:53.847 --> 16:55.213
it changes me?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.448
You know, it makes me
lose my faith

16:57.450 --> 16:59.183
and then I become really bad?

17:01.120 --> 17:02.954
You guys really think
I'm the cute one?

17:02.956 --> 17:04.622
You know
what's not cute?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.357
Pretending that you don't
know that you are.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.458
Schmidt, this sangria

17:07.460 --> 17:08.559
is just delicious.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.460
Thanks, man.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.728
I'm jealous of that

17:10.730 --> 17:11.963
little orange in there.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.197
It gets to just drink

17:13.199 --> 17:14.632
all the sangria it wants.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.334
Yeah. I'm
probably gonna...

17:16.336 --> 17:19.637
I'm gonna eat the orange, too.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.240
Guys' Night.
Guys' Night!

17:22.242 --> 17:23.174
(blowing)

17:23.176 --> 17:24.175
(whistles)

17:24.177 --> 17:25.476
(whistles)

17:25.478 --> 17:27.311
It's like instant
world music.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.646
(tones harmonizing)

17:28.648 --> 17:30.848
(laughing)

17:30.850 --> 17:32.750
Wait, shh.
- Why "shh"?

17:32.752 --> 17:34.252
I think he's finally...

17:34.254 --> 17:36.154
(Coach snores)

17:36.156 --> 17:37.688
...asleep.
- Asleep.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.491
(giggles)

17:40.493 --> 17:41.325
Cheers.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.027
Chin-chin.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.729
Um...

17:44.731 --> 17:45.997
Hey...

17:45.999 --> 17:48.399
I'm sorry.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.701
I was a little bit
of a jerk to you earlier.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.936
No, it's fine.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.704
I'm used to jerks.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.173
I used to work in finance.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.908
Oh! Finance!

17:56.910 --> 17:58.076
Mm-hmm.
- Really?

17:58.078 --> 17:59.410
Why did you leave?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.581
I know this sounds silly,
but I realized

18:03.583 --> 18:05.917
that the only time
I'd been really happy in my life

18:05.919 --> 18:08.619
was teaching my little sister
how to read.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.855
She suffers from
crippling dyslexia.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.423
Oh, God!
- What?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.592
You're just...
so perfect.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.860
Well, it's more common
than you might think.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.762
No, you're like the
most perfect person

18:17.764 --> 18:19.430
I've ever met.
And it's like

18:19.432 --> 18:20.731
you're an angel
who's been

18:20.733 --> 18:22.400
sent down to the
Earth, like...

18:22.402 --> 18:24.068
have you ever seen the movie
<i>The Preacher's Wife?</i>

18:24.070 --> 18:27.805
Anyway, I just have this
big, stupid crush on you.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.645
I...

18:34.647 --> 18:36.781
didn't say that.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.483
No, it's fine. It's-it's... no.
Shouldn't have
said... No.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.450
I shouldn't
have said that.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.085
I'm sorry,
um...
- I need a bucket.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.620
Now!

18:42.622 --> 18:43.754
Um, you
should go.
I need a bucket!

18:43.756 --> 18:44.789
(gags)
- Just go.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.823
No, let me help, please.
Let me help.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.125
No, just go,
just go, just go.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.160
COACH:
Ugh, gettin' the mouth sweats.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.995
Oh, I need
a bucket!
- Just go.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.930
Just go. Just go.
Okay.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.800
Why is there ice in here?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.735
More room...
- (sighs)

18:57.737 --> 18:58.970
...for what's
about to happen.

18:58.972 --> 19:02.740
Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!

19:05.944 --> 19:08.279
When I get home
I'm hitting the books.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.447
I am going to crush health.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.616
Yeah, you are.
- Yeah.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.850
Ned!

19:12.852 --> 19:14.185
Let me get his contact
before we leave.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.687
What?
- Ned!
I need details, bro!

19:16.689 --> 19:19.157
Hey, man. Am I gonna
get your e-mail?

19:19.159 --> 19:21.025
What's gonna
happen here?
- Yeah, let's do
it, let's do it.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.693
Let's do it,
let's do it.
- Yeah.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.296
It's therealned8
@guhmail.com.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.864
At guhmail...
you mean Gmail?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.666
Oh, is that
how you say it?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.702
Um...
(chuckles)

19:32.371 --> 19:33.504
Good morning.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.705
Good morning.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.341
Can I, um... talk
to you about last night?

19:37.343 --> 19:39.377
No, I want to talk
to you about last night,

19:39.379 --> 19:41.479
because I said some things, um,

19:41.481 --> 19:44.882
that don't reflect how
I really feel about you.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.150
Um...

19:46.152 --> 19:47.818
so I'd really appreciate it

19:47.820 --> 19:50.188
if you could strike them
from the record.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.391
It was the conference talking,
not me.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.493
Consider them struck.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.028
Thank you.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.363
Enjoy your
Thanksgiving vacation.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.898
It's, uh, an American holiday

20:00.900 --> 20:03.067
where we celebrate
the fact that we...

20:03.069 --> 20:06.137
didn't know how to farm
by ourselves.

20:06.139 --> 20:08.306
Are you curious to know

20:08.308 --> 20:10.408
how I really feel about you?

20:10.410 --> 20:11.842
No.
- Because if you were

20:11.844 --> 20:14.145
interested,
I'd tell you that

20:14.147 --> 20:15.680
I won't enjoy my Thanksgiving

20:15.682 --> 20:17.548
because I won't get
to see you every day.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.351
I think you're
beautiful

20:20.353 --> 20:21.819
and totally insane,

20:21.821 --> 20:23.154
and when I'm at work,

20:23.156 --> 20:24.388
I can't focus,

20:24.390 --> 20:25.523
because I can't get you

20:25.525 --> 20:26.724
out of my head.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.566
COACH:
Hey.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.735
Hey, uh, you guys
want to stop

20:37.737 --> 20:39.437
on the way home and
get some pancakes?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.339
Hey, what do you call
them in England?

20:41.341 --> 20:42.406
Roundy-yums.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.442
Really?
- No.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.477
See you after the holidays.

20:49.548 --> 20:50.848
Oh, boy.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.817
You didn't see anything!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.689
Where'd your lipstick go?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.224
Hit 'em! Hit 'em!
- From
the back.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.559
Hit 'em!
- Ugh!

21:01.561 --> 21:03.761
It smells terrible in here!

21:03.763 --> 21:05.863
How many beers
did you guys drink?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.798
So much.
- Beer, beer!
Lots of beer.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.066
Just a lot
of beer.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.201
That's how
beer smells.
- So many beers.

21:10.203 --> 21:11.235
(sniffs)

21:11.237 --> 21:12.303
Smells like sangria.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.638
SCHMIDT:
That must be the perfume

21:13.640 --> 21:15.239
from all the ladies
we hooked up with. Yeah.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.574
Mm-hmm.
- They were all
Spaniards.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.775
WINSTON:
Mine was named

21:17.777 --> 21:19.143
Señorita Lucinda
Madrid.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.444
Say, how was the conference?

21:20.446 --> 21:22.079
It was just... a stupid...

21:22.081 --> 21:23.614
conference...

21:26.752 --> 21:28.552
So she finally
hooked up with Ryan.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.088
He put his teeth
behind her teeth.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.824
Aah!

21:35.327 --> 21:36.961
(sighs)

21:36.963 --> 21:40.731
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God...

21:51.810 --> 21:54.779
<i>What the hell did you guys</i>
<i>do to my blanket?!</i>
