DR. DUBROW: Tonight,

00:08.230 --> 00:10.080
a Beverly Hills princess

00:10.089 --> 00:12.119
who isn't afraid

00:10.089 --> 00:12.119
to go to the extremes.

00:12.259 --> 00:13.199

00:18.089 --> 00:20.010

00:20.019 --> 00:22.059

DR. NASSIF: A nasal patient

00:27.030 --> 00:29.179
with a very unique story.

00:29.190 --> 00:31.050
When I was forming

00:29.190 --> 00:31.050
in the womb,

00:31.059 --> 00:34.039
the IUD had pushed up

00:31.059 --> 00:34.039
against my face.

00:34.049 --> 00:36.039
- No kidding.

00:34.049 --> 00:36.039

00:41.049 --> 00:42.030

01:04.140 --> 01:05.180
I just left the Fendi store.

I was pretty much

01:17.019 --> 01:18.180
My dad would give me a minimum

01:23.039 --> 01:27.180
On my birthday,

01:23.039 --> 01:27.180
he gave me a chunk of $50,000,

01:27.189 --> 01:31.159
and that went towards

01:27.189 --> 01:31.159
my first Brazilian butt lift

01:31.170 --> 01:32.189
and breast implants.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.090
In my lifetime,

01:34.099 --> 01:36.140
I have spent

including beauty treatments,

01:42.240 --> 01:45.039
I had a rhinoplasty,

01:45.049 --> 01:47.240
two breast augmentations

01:45.049 --> 01:47.240
with implants,

01:47.250 --> 01:49.200
two Brazilian butt lifts,

01:49.210 --> 01:52.030
two rounds

01:49.210 --> 01:52.030
of hydrogel injections,

01:52.039 --> 01:53.229
and I'm only 19 years old.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.210
At the age of 17,

01:55.289 --> 01:57.229
I appeared on

01:55.289 --> 01:57.229
the Dr. Phil show

01:57.240 --> 02:01.040
because my mom

01:57.240 --> 02:01.040
was against my dream

02:01.049 --> 02:03.150
of getting all

02:01.049 --> 02:03.150
the plastic surgeries I wanted.

02:03.159 --> 02:06.049
Like, I'm never happy

02:03.159 --> 02:06.049
with the results,

02:06.060 --> 02:07.219
so I'll just keep going

02:06.060 --> 02:07.219
more and more extreme.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.250
You're never satisfied

02:07.290 --> 02:09.250
with yourself.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.129
No, it's not with myself.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.129
It's with my appearance.

02:12.139 --> 02:15.060
Obviously, I didn't

02:12.139 --> 02:15.060
listen to their advice,

02:15.069 --> 02:16.219
and I just did what I wanted.

02:16.229 --> 02:19.099
When I go out,

02:16.229 --> 02:19.099
all the attention is on me.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.199
People just go crazy

02:19.110 --> 02:21.199
over my appearance,

02:21.210 --> 02:24.099
and stop me,

02:21.210 --> 02:24.099
and ask for my number.

02:24.110 --> 02:26.050
Even girls are stopping me,

02:26.060 --> 02:28.050
and it's just hard

02:26.060 --> 02:28.050
to go out alone

02:28.060 --> 02:30.060
because everyone's

02:28.060 --> 02:30.060
just attacking me

02:30.069 --> 02:31.199
as soon as I'm outside.

02:31.210 --> 02:34.050
I can't help it.

02:31.210 --> 02:34.050
I'm so hot.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.219
Okay. So I'm looking

02:34.060 --> 02:36.219
for the fabrics

02:36.229 --> 02:39.069
for my new waist trainer line.

02:39.079 --> 02:41.189
I love waist trainers

02:39.079 --> 02:41.189
because automatically

02:41.199 --> 02:43.139
it gives me that ideal size

02:43.150 --> 02:45.229
that I would like

02:43.150 --> 02:45.229
my natural body to look like,

02:45.240 --> 02:48.170
which is 18 to 20 inches.

02:48.180 --> 02:52.060
And a lot of my followers

02:48.180 --> 02:52.060
ask me about my waist,

02:52.069 --> 02:53.159
and they wanna have

02:52.069 --> 02:53.159
the same look.

02:53.170 --> 02:55.099
For me,

02:53.170 --> 02:55.099
making the waist trainers

02:55.110 --> 02:56.229
will help them achieve that.

02:57.009 --> 02:59.210
- Wow, this is super small.

02:57.009 --> 02:59.210
- Okay.

02:59.219 --> 03:01.139
- We're gonna make this work.

02:59.219 --> 03:01.139
- We got this, though.

03:01.150 --> 03:04.159
Okay.

03:01.150 --> 03:04.159
You pull, and I also pull.

03:04.169 --> 03:06.110
- [laughs]

03:04.169 --> 03:06.110
- Tighter.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.129
- Okay.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.129
- Go.

03:07.139 --> 03:10.229
I'm trying!

03:07.139 --> 03:10.229
It's gonna go on.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.139
- I'm trying.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.139
- Yes. Yes, I feel it tighter.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.169
MADISON:

03:14.150 --> 03:15.169
I think it's almost closed.

03:15.180 --> 03:16.199
I feel it being closed.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.090
- And done.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.090
- Okay.

03:18.099 --> 03:20.069
Look at how my booty pops

03:18.099 --> 03:20.069
in this.

03:20.079 --> 03:21.189
It's definitely popping.

03:21.199 --> 03:23.099
I think if you get it

03:21.199 --> 03:23.099
any bigger--

03:23.110 --> 03:24.240
No, I definitely

03:23.110 --> 03:24.240
want it bigger.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.090
I could have another implant

03:24.250 --> 03:27.090
right on top,

03:27.099 --> 03:28.259
just to make it like a shelf.

03:29.060 --> 03:32.060
My butt right now

03:29.060 --> 03:32.060
has the shape that I like,

03:32.069 --> 03:33.240
but I would like to get rid

03:32.069 --> 03:33.240
of some of the scarring

03:34.020 --> 03:35.180
from my BBLs,

03:35.189 --> 03:37.250
and to add butt implants

03:35.189 --> 03:37.250
for projection on top.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.240
In order to always

03:38.050 --> 03:40.240
have this waist,

03:41.020 --> 03:42.219
I think I'll have

03:41.020 --> 03:42.219
to get a rib removal.

03:42.229 --> 03:44.189
How many ribs

03:42.229 --> 03:44.189
would you have removed?

03:44.199 --> 03:47.150
Maybe around four, six?

03:47.159 --> 03:49.060
But I just feel like

03:47.159 --> 03:49.060
that's not safe.

03:49.069 --> 03:51.150
To me, having my perfect look

03:51.159 --> 03:53.180
is way more important

03:51.159 --> 03:53.180
than my health.

03:53.189 --> 03:57.069
I just want it to be permanent.

03:53.189 --> 03:57.069

04:12.090 --> 04:14.090
I am completely flat-chested.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.250
All right.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.250
We need a break.

04:18.029 --> 04:20.089
Yes, break time.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.259
Growing up,

04:20.100 --> 04:21.259
I was very overweight.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.269
So at 19, I finally got

04:22.029 --> 04:24.269
into the shape

04:24.279 --> 04:27.199
that I had been searching

04:24.279 --> 04:27.199
for pretty much my whole life.

04:27.209 --> 04:30.259
However, with that,

04:27.209 --> 04:30.259
I lost over 30 pounds.

04:30.269 --> 04:34.079
I went from having a natural F

04:30.269 --> 04:34.079
to a really saggy B.

04:34.090 --> 04:36.279
I decided I wanted to get

04:34.090 --> 04:36.279
the breast augmentation surgery.

04:36.290 --> 04:38.290
After that surgery,

04:36.290 --> 04:38.290
everything went wrong.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.199
I had a ton

04:39.000 --> 04:40.199
of different surgeries

04:40.209 --> 04:42.129
that ended up

04:40.209 --> 04:42.129

04:42.139 --> 04:45.090

04:42.139 --> 04:45.090
I do remember waking up,

04:45.100 --> 04:48.259
and feeling...

But being stripped

- I don't have 50 cents.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.189
[laughs]

06:06.250 --> 06:08.189
What's wrong with this picture?

06:08.199 --> 06:10.199
We don't carry

06:08.199 --> 06:10.199
quarters anymore.

06:10.209 --> 06:12.259
That's like, you know,

06:10.209 --> 06:12.259
back in the '80s, for God sakes.

06:12.269 --> 06:15.269
♪ I'm a modern man ♪

06:15.279 --> 06:17.209
Our next patient

06:15.279 --> 06:17.209
is named Jodi.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.199
Tell me what you know

06:17.220 --> 06:19.199
about Jodi right now.

06:19.209 --> 06:21.019
She's a firewoman.

06:21.029 --> 06:23.230
She has a pretty complicated

06:21.029 --> 06:23.230
breast history

06:23.240 --> 06:26.279
and has left her

06:23.240 --> 06:26.279
with very deflated breasts,

06:26.290 --> 06:28.230
with excess skin.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.230
But let's figure out

06:28.240 --> 06:30.230
what her history is.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.170
Can you please send in Jodi?

06:32.180 --> 06:33.199
- DR. DUBROW: Jodi.

06:32.180 --> 06:33.199
- Hello.

06:33.209 --> 06:34.279
- Yes.

06:33.209 --> 06:34.279
- Nice to meet you,

06:34.290 --> 06:36.009
- Dr. Nassif.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.009
- Nice to meet you.

06:36.019 --> 06:37.180
- How are you?

06:36.019 --> 06:37.180
- Terry Dubrow.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.240
- Nice to meet you.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.240
- Pleasure to meet you.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.139
- Who do we have here?

06:38.250 --> 06:40.139
- Hi, Devon.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.259
- Devon. Dr. Nassif.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.259
- Her best friend. Yes.

06:41.269 --> 06:43.180
- Nice to meet you, Dr. Nassif.

06:41.269 --> 06:43.180
- Terry Dubrow.

06:43.189 --> 06:45.149
- Nice to meet you, Dr. Dubrow.

06:43.189 --> 06:45.149
- Please have a seat.

06:45.159 --> 06:46.259
- You're a fire--

06:45.159 --> 06:46.259
- You're a firewoman, too?

06:46.269 --> 06:48.159
- Oh, sorry.

06:46.269 --> 06:48.159
- No, go ahead.

06:48.170 --> 06:50.180
No, I'm not.

06:48.170 --> 06:50.180
We met in the Air Force.

06:50.189 --> 06:51.120
- DR. DUBROW: In the Air Force?

06:50.189 --> 06:51.120
- DR. NASSIF: Air Force?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.129
JODI: Yes, about ten years ago?

06:53.139 --> 06:54.189
- Yes.

06:53.139 --> 06:54.189
- Okay, whoa, whoa.

06:54.199 --> 06:55.240
Are you--are you currently

06:54.199 --> 06:55.240
a firefighter?

06:55.250 --> 06:57.129
I am currently a firefighter.

06:57.139 --> 07:00.000
I joined the military

06:57.139 --> 07:00.000
10 years ago.

07:00.009 --> 07:01.290
I went active duty

07:00.009 --> 07:01.290
for a while in the Air Force,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.199
and then now

07:02.000 --> 07:03.199
I'm in the Air National Guard.

07:03.209 --> 07:05.180
Whoa.

07:03.209 --> 07:05.180
When you go to a call,

07:05.189 --> 07:07.149
and there's a fire, are you,

07:05.189 --> 07:07.149
like, grabbing the hose and...

07:07.160 --> 07:09.019
[imitates firehose]

07:07.160 --> 07:09.019
doing the whole thing? Is that--

07:09.029 --> 07:10.220
- JODI: Yeah. That's a thing.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.220
- Is that a thing?

07:10.230 --> 07:13.259
So obviously

07:10.230 --> 07:13.259
there have been some issues

07:13.269 --> 07:15.170
- with your breasts.

07:13.269 --> 07:15.170
- There have been a lot of them.

07:15.180 --> 07:16.189
How many operations

07:15.180 --> 07:16.189
have you had?

07:16.199 --> 07:19.019
- Fifteen.

07:16.199 --> 07:19.019
- Fifteen?

07:19.089 --> 07:21.019
- Fifteen breast surgeries?

07:19.089 --> 07:21.019
- Yeah.

07:21.089 --> 07:24.189
If someone has failed

07:21.089 --> 07:24.189
breast implant surgery

07:24.199 --> 07:26.040
so many times,

07:26.050 --> 07:27.220
they just may not be

07:26.050 --> 07:27.220
a candidate

07:27.230 --> 07:30.139
for breast implants ever

07:27.230 --> 07:30.139
in the future.

07:30.149 --> 07:32.139
So I went in

07:30.149 --> 07:32.139
for my first surgery.

07:32.149 --> 07:33.259
Was gonna get a lift

07:32.149 --> 07:33.259
and implants,

07:33.269 --> 07:35.259
and here we are.

07:35.269 --> 07:37.149
How big were the implants?

07:37.159 --> 07:39.199
- They talked me into 650.

07:37.159 --> 07:39.199
- Ooh. Big.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.199
- JODI: Yeah.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.199
- What happened?

07:41.209 --> 07:43.220
Well,

07:41.209 --> 07:43.220
they weren't dropping down.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.149
They were super high

07:43.230 --> 07:45.149
on my chest.

07:45.159 --> 07:46.209
- DR. DUBROW: Immediately?

07:45.159 --> 07:46.209
- JODI: Yeah.

07:47.220 --> 07:47.230
He's like,

07:47.220 --> 07:47.230
"Oh, it's not a big deal.

07:48.189 --> 07:49.259
We'll do a revision."

07:48.189 --> 07:49.259
Maybe a few days

07:50.250 --> 07:51.110
after I took the bandages off,

07:50.250 --> 07:51.110
and looked,

07:52.100 --> 07:52.189
I was like,

07:52.100 --> 07:52.189
"Something's not right."

07:53.100 --> 07:54.040
Uh-oh.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.040
Did they bottom out?

07:54.290 --> 07:55.209
- Yes. Yes.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.209
- DR. DUBROW: They did?

07:56.250 --> 07:57.199
- They released it too much.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.199
- JODI: Yup.

07:59.000 --> 07:59.009
DR. DUBROW: Hmm. Did you have

07:59.000 --> 07:59.009
a double bubble, too?

08:00.069 --> 08:00.259
- JODI: Yep.

08:00.069 --> 08:00.259
- DUBROW: Yeah. The whole thing.

08:02.009 --> 08:03.139
So, a couple of surgeries later,

08:02.009 --> 08:03.139
the left one was okay.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.050
- Better?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.050
- Right.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.170
The right side

08:05.060 --> 08:07.170
bottomed out again.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.040
- Okay.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.040
- And the same doctor,

08:09.050 --> 08:10.160
he did another surgery.

08:10.170 --> 08:13.040
It didn't

08:10.170 --> 08:13.040
bottom out necessarily.

08:13.050 --> 08:14.209
- DR. DUBROW: Okay.

08:13.050 --> 08:14.209
- But I noticed that the skin

08:14.220 --> 08:16.240
- started getting very thin.

08:14.220 --> 08:16.240
- Oh.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.040
And next thing you know,

08:18.050 --> 08:20.189
I remember it was 11:00

08:18.050 --> 08:20.189
at night.

08:20.199 --> 08:23.050
And I had, like,

08:20.199 --> 08:23.050
a dime-sized hole.

08:23.060 --> 08:24.279
- DR. NASSIF: That scar.

08:23.060 --> 08:24.279
- JODI: Came through my chest.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.050
DR. DUBROW:

08:24.290 --> 08:26.050
Right at the bottom of it?

08:26.149 --> 08:27.279
Right where the implant

08:26.149 --> 08:27.279
was sitting?

08:27.290 --> 08:29.000
So I called,

08:27.290 --> 08:29.000
and I told him what happened,

08:29.009 --> 08:30.290
I'm in pain, I'm in tears.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.029
I have an open wound.

08:32.110 --> 08:34.029
And his exact words,

08:34.110 --> 08:36.169
"You're fine.

08:34.110 --> 08:36.169
You're not gonna die tonight.

08:36.179 --> 08:38.210
"Just come in tomorrow.

08:36.179 --> 08:38.210
We'll take care of it.

08:38.220 --> 08:40.000
"And you'll be

08:38.220 --> 08:40.000
my pain-in-the-ass patient

08:40.009 --> 08:42.269
"for 2014."

08:42.279 --> 08:44.029
"You'll be

08:42.279 --> 08:44.029
my pain-in-the-ass patient?"

08:44.039 --> 08:45.250
- What?

08:44.039 --> 08:45.250
- Yeah.

08:45.259 --> 08:48.029
Honestly, at that point,

08:45.259 --> 08:48.029
I was done with that guy.

08:48.039 --> 08:50.029
I went to another doctor.

08:48.039 --> 08:50.029
He did tell me, like,

08:50.039 --> 08:53.019
"This is a crazy story.

08:50.039 --> 08:53.019
I really wanna help you.

08:53.029 --> 08:55.009
"I realize you probably have

08:53.029 --> 08:55.009
no money after all of this."

08:55.019 --> 08:58.019
And he's like, "I'm willing

08:55.019 --> 08:58.019
to help you for free,

08:58.029 --> 09:00.019
"but I would like

08:58.029 --> 09:00.019
to document this."

09:00.029 --> 09:02.059
- Yeah, P.R.

09:00.029 --> 09:02.059
- Camera people and whatever.

09:02.070 --> 09:04.220
The thing about him,

09:02.070 --> 09:04.220
he didn't know how to stop.

09:04.230 --> 09:07.000
I had nine surgeries

09:04.230 --> 09:07.000
with this second doctor.

09:07.009 --> 09:08.210
Nine more?

09:08.220 --> 09:10.269
Just every time that he tried

09:08.220 --> 09:10.269
to replace implants,

09:10.279 --> 09:13.019
he kept trying to put

09:10.279 --> 09:13.019
big implants in.

09:13.029 --> 09:15.220
And I remember saying, like,

09:13.029 --> 09:15.220
"Why don't we go smaller?"

09:15.230 --> 09:17.059
But he kept putting

09:15.230 --> 09:17.059
big implants

09:17.070 --> 09:19.230
and it never worked.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.230
The skin was so thin

09:19.240 --> 09:21.230
that the right side

09:21.240 --> 09:23.230
would just start to do

09:21.240 --> 09:23.230
the same thing, and--yeah.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.049
DR. DUBROW: Okay. So it was

09:23.240 --> 09:25.049
thinning of the skin,

09:25.059 --> 09:26.200
and a non-healing wound.

09:26.210 --> 09:27.159
It wouldn't tolerate

09:26.210 --> 09:27.159
the implant.

09:27.169 --> 09:29.000
Yeah.

09:29.009 --> 09:29.269
Especially with the skin

09:29.009 --> 09:29.269
getting thin,

09:29.279 --> 09:31.179
bottoming out, you know,

09:31.190 --> 09:33.070
shouldn't he have downsized

09:31.190 --> 09:33.070
a little bit?

09:33.080 --> 09:34.070
Those are heavy implants.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.029
- Yeah.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.029
- Right.

09:36.039 --> 09:37.289
In a girl

09:36.039 --> 09:37.289
who's showing complications

09:38.000 --> 09:40.259
related to the weight

09:38.000 --> 09:40.259
of the implants...

09:40.269 --> 09:42.029
- JODI: You would think--

09:40.269 --> 09:42.029
- ...you would think--

09:42.039 --> 09:44.019
In my very last surgery

09:42.039 --> 09:44.019
with him,

09:44.029 --> 09:47.029
I was like, "Look,

09:44.029 --> 09:47.029
this has taken over my life.

09:47.039 --> 09:51.029
"If things don't go correct,

09:47.039 --> 09:51.029
just remove them."

09:51.039 --> 09:53.039
- DR. DUBROW: Okay.

09:51.039 --> 09:53.039
- So he took them out?

09:53.049 --> 09:54.269
JODI:

09:53.049 --> 09:54.269
I literally have nothing.

09:54.279 --> 09:56.049
Nothing but skin.

09:56.059 --> 09:58.159
I was called a guy

09:56.059 --> 09:58.159
a couple times.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.190
My chest is something

10:01.080 --> 10:03.190
that I think about every day.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.070
I cry when I look

10:03.200 --> 10:05.070
in the mirror.

10:05.139 --> 10:08.090
I-I-I don't feel feminine

10:08.100 --> 10:10.289
at all anymore.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.149
And not having a chest

10:11.000 --> 10:14.149
is humiliating.

10:16.029 --> 10:18.179
What was wrong

10:18.190 --> 10:22.029
that we can potentially avoid?

10:22.039 --> 10:23.179
If we're gonna do something,

10:23.190 --> 10:25.070
we have to do

10:23.190 --> 10:25.070
something different.

10:25.169 --> 10:29.000
Or you have to say to yourself,

10:29.009 --> 10:31.019
"Maybe there's nothing

10:29.009 --> 10:31.019
you can do."

10:35.019 --> 10:36.279
- They lowered them out.

10:35.019 --> 10:36.279
- JODI: I see.

10:36.289 --> 10:39.269
But who has a breast down here?

10:39.279 --> 10:42.070
Jodi, your case has a very high

10:39.279 --> 10:42.070
probability of failure.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.259
JODI: I know.

10:43.269 --> 10:45.029
- Take a look at his nose.

10:45.039 --> 10:46.259
Oh! Ho ho.

10:46.269 --> 10:48.269
Is that really something

10:46.269 --> 10:48.269
that can be fixed?

10:53.019 --> 10:55.110
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

10:56.230 --> 10:57.029
DR. DUBROW: Do me a favor.

10:56.230 --> 10:57.029
First thing that I wanna see

10:58.000 --> 10:59.269
is put your hands on your hips

10:58.000 --> 10:59.269
and push.

10:59.279 --> 11:02.200
You know, you were a girl

10:59.279 --> 11:02.200
with very full breasts.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.289
- Yeah.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.289
- And so, this is your envelope.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.200
So ultimately, the mound

11:06.210 --> 11:08.009
was all the way down here,

11:06.210 --> 11:08.009
right?

11:08.019 --> 11:09.220
They put this big implant in.

11:09.230 --> 11:13.009
But this is on the abdomen.

11:13.019 --> 11:15.210
- Who has a breast down here?

11:13.019 --> 11:15.210
- Yeah.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.080
But they were trying

11:15.220 --> 11:17.080
to accommodate

11:17.090 --> 11:21.090
the deflational change

11:17.090 --> 11:21.090
by putting a large implant.

11:21.190 --> 11:24.080
And they were faced

11:21.190 --> 11:24.080
with a pre-existing

11:24.179 --> 11:27.039
little bit naturally

11:24.179 --> 11:27.039
lowered areola.

11:27.049 --> 11:29.059
You can't just move the areola,

11:29.070 --> 11:31.240
- so they lowered the mound.

11:29.070 --> 11:31.240
- JODI: I see.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.250
And nature will only let you

11:33.259 --> 11:37.259
lower the mound so much

11:33.259 --> 11:37.259
before you get

11:37.269 --> 11:39.110
into what I call

11:37.269 --> 11:39.110
"Double Bubbleville."

11:39.120 --> 11:41.019
- JODI: Yeah.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.019
- A double bubble

11:41.029 --> 11:44.120
is when you lower

11:41.029 --> 11:44.120
the breast crease on a patient

11:44.129 --> 11:46.289
to make room

11:44.129 --> 11:46.289
to put an implant in.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.240
But if you lower it too far,

11:47.000 --> 11:51.240
you have two creases--

11:51.250 --> 11:54.100
one, the original

11:51.250 --> 11:54.100
inframammary crease,

11:54.110 --> 11:56.059
and the new one you created

11:54.110 --> 11:56.059
when you lowered it.

11:56.070 --> 11:59.200
I still can't wrap my brain

11:56.070 --> 11:59.200
around

11:59.210 --> 12:01.200
as to why it failed.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.259
Was it because it was thin skin

12:02.269 --> 12:04.070
- and it kept dropping?

12:02.269 --> 12:04.070
- Yeah.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.059
Was it double bubbling

12:04.080 --> 12:06.059
because they lowered

12:06.070 --> 12:08.009
the crease too much?

12:08.019 --> 12:11.090
The question is to why

12:08.019 --> 12:11.090
Jodi's breast operations

12:11.100 --> 12:13.080
kept failing.

12:13.090 --> 12:16.240
It's most likely related

12:13.090 --> 12:16.240
to a number of factors,

12:16.250 --> 12:21.059
not the least of which

12:16.250 --> 12:21.059
is her own soft tissue weakness,

12:21.070 --> 12:24.090
and the inability

12:21.070 --> 12:24.090
to tolerate a large implant.

12:24.100 --> 12:28.039
That's why any plan

12:24.100 --> 12:28.039
that I may formulate

12:28.049 --> 12:30.120
must include a smaller implant

12:30.129 --> 12:34.100
to maximize the amount

12:30.129 --> 12:34.100
of soft tissue coverage,

12:34.110 --> 12:38.110
and minimize the weight

12:34.110 --> 12:38.110
of the implant

12:38.120 --> 12:40.210
on the surrounding

12:38.120 --> 12:40.210
tissue itself.

12:40.220 --> 12:44.029
You have a very short distance

12:40.220 --> 12:44.029
between the areola,

12:44.039 --> 12:47.100
and that non-existent

12:44.039 --> 12:47.100
lower pole crease.

12:47.110 --> 12:49.279
- Right.

12:47.110 --> 12:49.279
- So, how do we get

12:50.000 --> 12:52.070
an implant in there,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.070
and not have the areola

12:52.080 --> 12:55.240
live in the bottom part

12:52.080 --> 12:55.240
of the mound?

12:55.250 --> 12:58.019
I think there is only

12:55.250 --> 12:58.019
one possible plan,

12:58.029 --> 13:01.009
and that is we make an incision,

13:01.019 --> 13:04.080
we open up the pocket

13:01.019 --> 13:04.080
very gently.

13:04.090 --> 13:08.240
We put an implant in

13:04.090 --> 13:08.240
that the pocket dictates.

13:08.250 --> 13:12.059
So we go full enough

13:08.250 --> 13:12.059
to give you nice volume,

13:12.070 --> 13:15.059
but not so full

13:12.070 --> 13:15.059
as to make it a tight closure,

13:15.070 --> 13:17.110
or putting much

13:15.070 --> 13:17.110
internal pressure

13:17.210 --> 13:20.059
- on the breast tissue.

13:17.210 --> 13:20.059
- Right.

13:20.070 --> 13:22.250
Jodi, your case has a very high

13:20.070 --> 13:22.250
probability of failure.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.269
I think it's probably

13:22.259 --> 13:25.269
less than 50% chance of success.

13:25.279 --> 13:28.120
- You wanna do this thing?

13:25.279 --> 13:28.120
- Yeah.

13:28.220 --> 13:30.120
I don't even remember

13:28.220 --> 13:30.120
what it feels like

13:30.129 --> 13:33.120
to put on a bathing suit

13:30.129 --> 13:33.120
and feel confident,

13:33.220 --> 13:36.230
to feel like a woman,

13:33.220 --> 13:36.230
and if I can take a risk

13:36.240 --> 13:39.120
for the chance

13:36.240 --> 13:39.120
of that being possible,

13:39.129 --> 13:40.289
it's worth it to me.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.289
Do you think that

13:41.000 --> 13:43.289
if there was a fire,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.100
and he was unconscious

13:44.000 --> 13:46.100
in a bedroom somewhere

13:46.110 --> 13:47.129
that you could carry this guy

13:46.110 --> 13:47.129
out of there?

13:47.230 --> 13:49.090
- Absolutely. Yes.

13:47.230 --> 13:49.090
- Seriously?

13:49.100 --> 13:50.250
Will you throw him on your back?

13:49.100 --> 13:50.250
How does that work?

13:50.259 --> 13:52.129
- I'd probably drag him.

13:50.259 --> 13:52.129
- [laughs]

13:52.230 --> 13:53.269
We got to stay low, the smoke--

13:53.279 --> 13:55.009
Drag him?

13:55.019 --> 13:58.019
[music]

14:00.269 --> 14:02.259
DAVID: It's just not good

14:00.269 --> 14:02.259
on my face, right?

14:02.269 --> 14:04.120
SHERRY: Yeah.

14:02.269 --> 14:04.120
It's like, it's off-center...

14:04.129 --> 14:06.000
- DAVID: Yeah. You can see.

14:04.129 --> 14:06.000
- SHERRY: ...for your nose.

14:06.009 --> 14:07.240
It would be--

14:06.009 --> 14:07.240
if it was more symmetrical,

14:07.250 --> 14:09.129
the glasses wouldn't be

14:07.250 --> 14:09.129
such a big issue.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.289
My name is David,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.250
and my nose

14:11.000 --> 14:14.250
is just kind of trash.

14:14.259 --> 14:18.000
It's shifted to the left,

14:14.259 --> 14:18.000
the right side of my nose

14:18.009 --> 14:20.059
is completely crushed

14:18.009 --> 14:20.059
and caved in,

14:20.070 --> 14:21.120
and I have

14:20.070 --> 14:21.120
a hard time breathing

14:21.129 --> 14:23.110
and I get tremendous headaches.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.159
It's just an annoyance,

14:23.120 --> 14:25.159
every time I have to...

14:25.169 --> 14:27.000
- I know. Get--

14:25.169 --> 14:27.000
- DAVID: ...go get glasses,

14:27.009 --> 14:29.159
- I have to be reminded.

14:27.009 --> 14:29.159
- SHERRY: Well...

14:29.169 --> 14:31.279
I don't like what I see,

14:29.169 --> 14:31.279
and then, I...

14:31.289 --> 14:33.029
I know, but I don't want you

14:31.289 --> 14:33.029
to feel like that.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.039
Oh, I know.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.039
Well, I do.

14:35.049 --> 14:37.149
Growing up, my nose didn't

14:35.049 --> 14:37.149
look like everybody else's.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.289
I did get teased relentlessly.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.139
It did really bother me

14:40.000 --> 14:43.139
that I was different.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.059
I'm telling you, let's go.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.059
Let's go get an opinion

14:45.070 --> 14:47.090
because I think it might help.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.059
- I don't know, maybe it's time.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.059
- Now or never.

14:49.070 --> 14:52.070
[music]

14:52.080 --> 14:54.000
DR. NASSIF:

14:52.080 --> 14:54.000
I wanna get your opinion.

14:54.009 --> 14:55.269
- DR. DUBROW: What do you have?

14:54.009 --> 14:55.269
- This is David.

14:55.279 --> 14:57.019
- Take a look at his nose.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.269
- Oh! Ho ho.

14:58.279 --> 15:01.019
I mean, I can't even wrap

14:58.279 --> 15:01.019
my brain around the anatomy,

15:01.029 --> 15:03.080
I mean, it's like a melted wax,

15:01.029 --> 15:03.080
out of a--

15:03.090 --> 15:05.039
I was gonna say more

15:03.090 --> 15:05.039
of a--a sledgehammer

15:05.049 --> 15:07.029
to the side of his nose.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.029
DR. DUBROW: Is that really

15:07.039 --> 15:09.029
something that can be fixed?

15:09.039 --> 15:10.039
- DR. NASSIF: I don't know.

15:09.039 --> 15:10.039
- DR. DUBROW: Even by you?

15:10.049 --> 15:12.049
Can you please send in David?

15:12.059 --> 15:13.149
- David.

15:12.059 --> 15:13.149
- Hello.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.049
Nice to meet you David,

15:13.250 --> 15:15.049
Dr. Nassif.

15:15.059 --> 15:16.019
- Nice to meet you.

15:15.059 --> 15:16.019
- Terry Dubrow, David.

15:16.029 --> 15:17.159
Pleasure to meet you.

15:17.259 --> 15:20.129
I've been living

15:17.259 --> 15:20.129
with this nose my entire life.

15:20.139 --> 15:22.100
I don't want it to be

15:20.139 --> 15:22.100
an issue anymore.

15:22.110 --> 15:26.110
I mean, my daughter refers

15:22.110 --> 15:26.110
to my nose as an "IUDisaster".

15:26.120 --> 15:28.070
What is "IUDisaster"?

15:28.080 --> 15:31.100
My mother had an IUD,

15:28.080 --> 15:31.100
and she got pregnant with me,

15:31.110 --> 15:33.159
so I'm the one percent.

15:31.110 --> 15:33.159
So--

15:33.259 --> 15:35.120
And she called you a disaster?

15:35.129 --> 15:38.059
No, I--she did not.

15:35.129 --> 15:38.059
That was my daughter.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.009
When I was forming in the womb,

15:40.019 --> 15:42.289
somehow the IUD

15:40.019 --> 15:42.289
had come and pushed up

15:43.000 --> 15:45.169
against my face,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.169
and deformed my nose.

15:45.269 --> 15:46.269
- No kidding.

15:45.269 --> 15:46.269
- DAVID: Yeah.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.059
How would you know that,

15:48.070 --> 15:51.110
or how would the doctor

15:48.070 --> 15:51.110
even know that?

15:51.120 --> 15:53.080
When you're born, was there

15:51.120 --> 15:53.080
anything else wrong with you,

15:53.090 --> 15:55.070
- besides the nose?

15:53.090 --> 15:55.070
- No.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.269
For the first couple years

15:55.080 --> 15:57.269
of my life,

15:57.279 --> 15:59.149
- my nose had no structure.

15:57.279 --> 15:59.149
- SHERRY: Yeah.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.080
No cartilage,

15:59.250 --> 16:02.080
I've had two surgeries,

16:02.090 --> 16:05.149
one when I was five.

16:02.090 --> 16:05.149
They had taken rib,

16:05.259 --> 16:08.110
and they started building up

16:05.259 --> 16:08.110
a structure in my nose.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.159
- At the age of five.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.159
- Yeah.

16:10.169 --> 16:13.179
That surgery alone

16:10.169 --> 16:13.179
can cause a problem

16:13.190 --> 16:16.159
with the growth plates

16:13.190 --> 16:16.159
in your nose and even growing.

16:16.169 --> 16:18.139
That might have prohibited

16:16.169 --> 16:18.139
some of your growth.

16:18.149 --> 16:20.159
And then I had a second

16:18.149 --> 16:20.159
follow-up surgery,

16:20.169 --> 16:22.179
which did essentially

16:20.169 --> 16:22.179
the same thing,

16:22.190 --> 16:24.120
but kind of made it

16:22.190 --> 16:24.120
a little bit bigger,

16:24.129 --> 16:27.029
but when I hit about

16:24.129 --> 16:27.029
13 years old,

16:27.039 --> 16:29.139
I notice things kind of shifted

16:29.149 --> 16:31.100
into the position

16:29.149 --> 16:31.100
that it is now.

16:31.110 --> 16:33.129
That's when kind of

16:31.110 --> 16:33.129
the headaches started,

16:33.139 --> 16:35.080
But I've been to a neurologist

16:35.090 --> 16:37.009
and couldn't find anything

16:35.090 --> 16:37.009
wrong with me. So--

16:37.019 --> 16:38.149
And you're still having

16:37.019 --> 16:38.149
these same exact headaches--

16:38.159 --> 16:40.169
- DAVID: I do, yeah.

16:38.159 --> 16:40.169
- But they're not migraines.

16:40.179 --> 16:42.179
The neurologist called them

16:40.179 --> 16:42.179
cluster headaches.

16:42.279 --> 16:44.129
- Yeah, there you go.

16:42.279 --> 16:44.129
- Oh, yeah. Cluster headaches.

16:44.139 --> 16:46.059
Yeah, and it's usually

16:44.139 --> 16:46.059
two or three a month.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.169
It feels like somebody's

16:46.070 --> 16:48.169
stabbing an ice pick

16:48.179 --> 16:50.159
through your eye,

16:48.179 --> 16:50.159
and twisting and twisting

16:50.169 --> 16:53.090
and it's relentless.

16:50.169 --> 16:53.090
They'll last for hours.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.149
Tell us what your goals are.

16:54.159 --> 16:56.080
I'm having some health issues.

16:56.090 --> 16:57.179
I would like

16:56.090 --> 16:57.179
to have those resolved.

16:57.279 --> 16:59.149
The headaches.

16:57.279 --> 16:59.149
My breathing.

16:59.159 --> 17:01.049
I can feel from one nostril

16:59.159 --> 17:01.049
to the other.

17:01.059 --> 17:03.049
Like, no air comes out

17:01.059 --> 17:03.049
of one side at all.

17:03.059 --> 17:05.049
So like,

17:03.059 --> 17:05.049
even when we were dating,

17:05.059 --> 17:07.029
we would be kissing,

17:05.059 --> 17:07.029
and he would kind of pull away,

17:07.039 --> 17:07.289
- and at first, I'm like--

17:07.039 --> 17:07.289
- Yeah, yeah, take a breath.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.269
--"Do you not like kissing me?"

17:08.250 --> 17:09.269
Yeah.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.240
And then, he basically said,

17:09.279 --> 17:10.240
"Well, when I kiss,

17:10.250 --> 17:13.009
"it's almost like

17:10.250 --> 17:13.009
I'm holding my breath

17:13.019 --> 17:14.210
"because I can't breathe

17:13.019 --> 17:14.210
through my nose."

17:14.220 --> 17:17.089
But, I mean, I'd like

17:14.220 --> 17:17.089
to have some symmetry.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.200
What you want

17:17.099 --> 17:18.200
is a more normal nose.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.190
- Right.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.190
- He wants to blend in.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.119
He's not a social person,

17:20.289 --> 17:23.119
I'm the more social person.

17:23.130 --> 17:25.109
- I can see that.

17:23.130 --> 17:25.109
- He likes to just blend in.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.039
- Doesn't wanna go to parties.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.039
- So the question is,

17:27.049 --> 17:28.160
if he gets this fixed,

17:28.170 --> 17:31.029
will he turn into, like,

17:28.170 --> 17:31.029
a raving lunatic?

17:31.039 --> 17:33.160
- Probably not.

17:31.039 --> 17:33.160
- DR. DUBROW: At the disco.

17:33.170 --> 17:34.160
- I wish!

17:33.170 --> 17:34.160
- [laughter]

17:34.170 --> 17:36.099
He'll be at the disco.

17:36.109 --> 17:38.109
- ♪ Ooh! ♪

17:36.109 --> 17:38.109

17:39.099 --> 17:42.029
You have a really complicated,

17:43.289 --> 17:45.140
David, we can--

17:45.150 --> 17:47.039
You've lived with it this long,

17:45.150 --> 17:47.039
and we can--

17:47.049 --> 17:49.039
we don't have to do this.

17:49.049 --> 17:52.049
We have a couple videos

17:49.049 --> 17:52.049

Ow, my leg.

18:07.230 --> 18:07.240
Let's take a peek inside.

18:08.079 --> 18:08.289
DAVID: Okay.

18:09.259 --> 18:11.180
Your septum is pushed

18:09.259 --> 18:11.180
all the way over

18:11.190 --> 18:13.099
to your right side, blocking

18:13.109 --> 18:14.210
a hundred percent

18:13.109 --> 18:14.210
of your airway.

18:15.009 --> 18:16.220
Uh... [sighs]

18:17.019 --> 18:20.099
The only time I've seen someone

18:17.019 --> 18:20.099
get relief from headaches

18:20.109 --> 18:23.059
is when I saw the septum

18:20.109 --> 18:23.059
so badly deviated,

18:23.069 --> 18:24.140
that it's touching the side

18:24.150 --> 18:25.109
of the wall

18:24.150 --> 18:25.109
and the turbinates.

18:26.099 --> 18:27.049
Here it looks like

18:26.099 --> 18:27.049
it's touching everything.

18:27.059 --> 18:29.210
I would hope

18:27.059 --> 18:29.210
that you get some relief.

18:29.220 --> 18:32.109
However, you are gonna be

18:29.220 --> 18:32.109
one of these patients,

18:32.119 --> 18:34.250
which is rare for me to say,

18:32.119 --> 18:34.250
that I really don't know exactly

18:34.259 --> 18:36.180
what's happening inside

18:34.259 --> 18:36.180
your nose

18:36.190 --> 18:38.049
until I go in surgery.

18:38.059 --> 18:40.049
So I cannot give you

18:38.059 --> 18:40.049
a plan right now,

18:40.059 --> 18:42.210
except take rib cartilage,

18:40.059 --> 18:42.210
open up your nose,

18:42.220 --> 18:45.170
look and see what's going on,

18:42.220 --> 18:45.170
and start from there.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.119
- I'm not convinced...

18:45.180 --> 18:47.119
- Yeah.

18:47.130 --> 18:49.119
- ...that this is from an IUD.

18:47.130 --> 18:49.119
- Okay.

18:49.130 --> 18:50.230
- I'm more convinced that...

18:49.130 --> 18:50.230
- Congenital.

18:51.039 --> 18:52.099
...this is a congenital issue.

18:52.109 --> 18:53.089
Your left side

18:52.109 --> 18:53.089
developed normally,

18:54.089 --> 18:55.089
- your right side didn't.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.089
- DR. DUBROW: Yeah.

18:55.099 --> 18:57.190
A baby's gonna be moving around

18:55.099 --> 18:57.190
all the time,

18:57.200 --> 18:59.049
just swimming around

18:57.200 --> 18:59.049
in that uterus.

18:59.059 --> 19:01.259
Seems a little hard to believe

19:01.269 --> 19:05.230
that an IUD

19:01.269 --> 19:05.230
can just sit on a baby's face

19:05.240 --> 19:08.160
the whole time,

19:05.240 --> 19:08.160
and cause that kind of damage.

19:08.170 --> 19:10.210
My whole world changed,

19:08.170 --> 19:10.210
you know.

19:10.220 --> 19:12.210
I've been told this all my life.

19:12.220 --> 19:14.119
Now you're--you're telling me

19:14.130 --> 19:16.230
it's this other

19:14.130 --> 19:16.230
congenital problem.

19:17.029 --> 19:20.200
It almost does look like

19:17.029 --> 19:20.200
a cleft lip nasal deformity.

19:20.210 --> 19:22.099
On that whole side.

19:20.210 --> 19:22.099
Because even if you did have

19:22.109 --> 19:24.109
an IUD pushing on your nose,

19:24.119 --> 19:28.220
it's not gonna cause this bone

19:24.119 --> 19:28.220
to be way outside over here.

19:28.230 --> 19:31.230
It's just not gonna cause

19:28.230 --> 19:31.230
some of these defects.

19:31.240 --> 19:35.140
That's the word that

19:31.240 --> 19:35.140
I didn't want to hear, "defect.

19:35.150 --> 19:39.240
Well, you're defective now,

19:35.150 --> 19:39.240
right?

19:40.039 --> 19:42.089
There wasn't something

19:40.039 --> 19:42.089
that made you defective,

19:42.099 --> 19:44.089
it was just you.

19:44.099 --> 19:48.059
It feels awful to have lived

19:44.099 --> 19:48.059
51 years of my life,

19:48.069 --> 19:50.240
having one story,

19:48.069 --> 19:50.240
and then,

19:51.039 --> 19:53.200
right now...

unknown situation.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.190
- DR. NASSIF: Are you okay?

20:09.250 --> 20:11.190
- Mm-hmm.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.109
You don't have to do this,

20:11.200 --> 20:13.109
David, we can--

20:13.119 --> 20:14.250

20:19.119 --> 20:20.259
Do not be sorry.

20:21.059 --> 20:22.259
So let me--let me give you

20:21.059 --> 20:22.259
a little bit more information.

20:23.059 --> 20:25.170
The point is you're missing

20:23.059 --> 20:25.170
bone and cartilage

20:25.180 --> 20:28.269
and no matter what, your septum

20:25.180 --> 20:28.269
is horribly deviated.

20:28.279 --> 20:30.180
We gotta fix that,

20:30.190 --> 20:32.079
because if I can get

20:30.190 --> 20:32.079
your headaches better,

20:32.089 --> 20:34.069
and I don't know if I can,

20:34.079 --> 20:36.230
but get your breathing better,

20:34.079 --> 20:36.230
get your lifestyle better,

20:36.240 --> 20:38.140
that right there,

20:36.240 --> 20:38.140
opening up your right airway

20:38.150 --> 20:40.130
is gonna do

20:38.150 --> 20:40.130
so much good for you.

20:40.140 --> 20:42.140
So I wanna do that

20:40.140 --> 20:42.140
no matter what

20:42.150 --> 20:44.089
as long as you give me

20:42.150 --> 20:44.089
the permission.

20:44.099 --> 20:46.079
I think I need it.

20:46.089 --> 20:48.170
It's hard to hear

20:46.089 --> 20:48.170
that the problem is congenital

20:48.180 --> 20:51.140
but if there's a chance

20:48.180 --> 20:51.140
to fix some of the--

20:51.150 --> 20:52.289
maybe the aesthetic problems

20:53.000 --> 20:55.130
and fix some

20:53.000 --> 20:55.130

21:56.079 --> 21:59.109

22:12.230 --> 22:14.109
Put you up in a nice apartment

22:14.119 --> 22:15.200

22:35.119 --> 22:36.269
from Rodeo and--

22:39.119 --> 22:40.190
Ow, my leg.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.289
It's not--it's not even funny.

22:42.089 --> 22:43.250
Stop filming.

22:42.089 --> 22:43.250
It's not even funny.

22:43.259 --> 22:45.009
Stop filming!

22:45.019 --> 22:47.250
Okay.

22:45.019 --> 22:47.250
So obviously we're here

22:47.259 --> 22:49.180
to talk about

22:47.259 --> 22:49.180
some of the plastic surgeries.

22:49.190 --> 22:51.200
What did you book

22:49.190 --> 22:51.200
as soon as you turned 18?

22:51.210 --> 22:54.119
So my first surgeries

22:51.210 --> 22:54.119
were breast augmentation

22:54.130 --> 22:55.269
and a Brazilian butt lift.

22:55.279 --> 22:57.250
I mean, it was like

22:55.279 --> 22:57.250
the most minimal BBL.

22:57.259 --> 23:00.130
It just changed

22:57.259 --> 23:00.130
my body shape a little bit.

23:00.140 --> 23:02.130
It wasn't the result

23:00.140 --> 23:02.130
that I was looking for.

23:02.140 --> 23:05.230
So then I booked another BBL

23:05.240 --> 23:07.000
but with butt implants.

23:07.099 --> 23:08.240
Oh, it's not a great idea

23:07.099 --> 23:08.240
to do a BBL

23:08.250 --> 23:10.009
and butt implants

23:08.250 --> 23:10.009
at the same time, by the way.

23:10.109 --> 23:11.160
- Right.

23:10.109 --> 23:11.160
- All right. So--

23:11.170 --> 23:12.220
The implants had to be

23:11.170 --> 23:12.220
removed.

23:12.230 --> 23:15.000
- Okay.

23:12.230 --> 23:15.000
- They left some scars,

23:15.099 --> 23:16.220
like, the butt implants,

23:16.230 --> 23:18.009
which I wasn't happy about.

23:18.019 --> 23:19.279
So now I'm trying to have

23:19.289 --> 23:21.230
- those scars taken out.

23:19.289 --> 23:21.230
- Okay.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.130
DR. DUBROW: Although

23:21.240 --> 23:23.130
I think it's very clear

23:23.140 --> 23:25.279
there's more

23:23.140 --> 23:25.279
of a social media emphasis

23:25.289 --> 23:27.190
towards having

23:25.289 --> 23:27.190
plastic surgery procedures

23:27.200 --> 23:29.000
at a much younger age

23:29.009 --> 23:31.180
than what's happening

23:29.009 --> 23:31.180
previously,

23:31.190 --> 23:32.289
I don't think

23:31.190 --> 23:32.289
that's a good idea.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.039
I think she's going down

23:34.049 --> 23:36.009
a very dangerous path

23:36.109 --> 23:37.240
and her chances of running

23:37.250 --> 23:40.220
into a potentially

23:37.250 --> 23:40.220
life-threatening complication

23:40.230 --> 23:41.279
is extremely high.

23:41.289 --> 23:43.130
Tell us your main goals.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.009
Maybe like adding a butt implant

23:45.019 --> 23:46.279
just to finish

23:45.019 --> 23:46.279
the projection

23:46.289 --> 23:48.230
and also, like,

23:46.289 --> 23:48.230
some of my friends

23:48.240 --> 23:50.170
- have their ribs removed.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.170
- No.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.279
- I'm looking for--

23:50.180 --> 23:51.279
- You're not into it?

23:51.289 --> 23:53.140
I'm not into it.

23:51.289 --> 23:53.140
I do not support

23:53.150 --> 23:55.009
her ribs being removed, no.

23:55.109 --> 23:57.009
Well, we're obviously

23:55.109 --> 23:57.009
gonna examine you

23:57.019 --> 23:58.250
and give you our best advice

23:57.019 --> 23:58.250
and hopefully

23:58.259 --> 24:01.009
you'll resonate

23:58.259 --> 24:01.009
with that advice.

24:01.019 --> 24:02.259
Tamara's my best friend

24:01.019 --> 24:02.259
and I need her to stay

24:02.269 --> 24:05.130
my best friend which mean

24:02.269 --> 24:05.130
staying safe and alive.

24:08.130 --> 24:09.049
DR. DUBROW: Check this out.

24:09.059 --> 24:10.220
There's just--

24:10.230 --> 24:12.150
There's a little bit

24:10.230 --> 24:12.150
of asymmetry.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.210
Yeah. You have a abnormality.

24:15.250 --> 24:19.130
Having a good set

24:15.250 --> 24:19.130
of full eyebrows,

24:19.140 --> 24:20.259
that really makes you

24:19.140 --> 24:20.259
look younger.

24:20.269 --> 24:23.029
You mean make you look

24:20.269 --> 24:23.029
ridiculous?

24:23.039 --> 24:24.230
Oh, oh, it's working.

24:28.069 --> 24:30.150
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

24:31.210 --> 24:31.220
DR. DUBROW: All right.

24:31.210 --> 24:31.220
Let me see--let me see

24:32.119 --> 24:32.130
the buttock area. Okay.

24:33.039 --> 24:33.279
So you have

24:33.039 --> 24:33.279
good projection.

24:34.109 --> 24:35.240
You have a full buttock.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.009
TAMARA: These are

24:35.250 --> 24:37.009
those scars as well.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.150
- Oh, yeah, we see that.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.150
- Which I have,

24:38.160 --> 24:39.240
like, tan on them.

24:39.250 --> 24:42.210
Check this out. There's just--

24:42.220 --> 24:43.289
There's a little bit

24:42.220 --> 24:43.289
of asymmetry.

24:44.000 --> 24:44.289
Yeah, there is.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.259
Your right scapula

24:47.269 --> 24:50.140
is differently shaped

24:47.269 --> 24:50.140
than your left.

24:50.150 --> 24:52.019
You may have just

24:50.150 --> 24:52.019
a little bit

24:52.119 --> 24:53.240
of scoliosis.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.240
Scoliosis is a curvature

24:53.250 --> 24:56.240
of the spine.

24:56.250 --> 24:59.009
If she undergoes

24:56.250 --> 24:59.009
any destabilizing

24:59.019 --> 25:01.190
procedures like putting

24:59.019 --> 25:01.190
large buttock implants

25:01.200 --> 25:04.170
or rib removal, it may lead

25:01.200 --> 25:04.170
to a very significant

25:04.180 --> 25:06.200
musculoskeletal abnormality

25:06.210 --> 25:09.200
that could give her

25:06.210 --> 25:09.200
potential breathing problems

25:09.210 --> 25:11.200
or could lead

25:09.210 --> 25:11.200
to postural difficulties

25:11.210 --> 25:12.250
in the future.

25:12.259 --> 25:16.000
Your waist looks super small.

25:16.009 --> 25:18.140
What ribs are you looking

25:16.009 --> 25:18.140
to have removed?

25:18.150 --> 25:20.259
I think if we remove

25:18.150 --> 25:20.259
like two ribs

25:20.269 --> 25:22.190
- or three ribs on each side...

25:20.269 --> 25:22.190
- Okay.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.029
...then it would really

25:22.200 --> 25:24.029
cinch it in way more.

25:24.130 --> 25:26.130
Like, just--

25:26.140 --> 25:28.200
You know the ribs do supply

25:26.140 --> 25:28.200
an important function.

25:28.210 --> 25:31.019
They provide armor

25:31.119 --> 25:34.150
coverage over your lungs,

25:34.160 --> 25:36.200
your liver, your spleen,

25:36.210 --> 25:37.210
- you know, things like that.

25:36.210 --> 25:37.210
- DR. NASSIF: Kidneys.

25:37.220 --> 25:39.039
The kidneys.

25:39.049 --> 25:41.049
I mean, they're really

25:39.049 --> 25:41.049
important, you know.

25:41.059 --> 25:43.009
I agree with him.

25:41.059 --> 25:43.009
They are very important.

25:43.019 --> 25:46.259
And you already have

25:43.019 --> 25:46.259
a abnormality.

25:46.269 --> 25:50.170
If you change

25:46.269 --> 25:50.170
the basic architecture

25:50.180 --> 25:53.170
of your thoracic

25:50.180 --> 25:53.170
cage structure,

25:53.180 --> 25:56.039
that might even change

25:53.180 --> 25:56.039
your scapular asymmetry

25:56.140 --> 25:58.279
even more and make you

25:56.140 --> 25:58.279
look really weird.

25:58.289 --> 26:00.140
- No, I don't want that.

25:58.289 --> 26:00.140
- Yeah, you don't wanna

26:00.150 --> 26:02.029
look weird.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.029
Weird, not good.

26:02.039 --> 26:04.250
Hearing the doctors

26:02.039 --> 26:04.250
tell me that my posture

26:04.259 --> 26:06.240
might really mess up

26:06.250 --> 26:08.180
if I have the rib removal

26:08.190 --> 26:10.190
was a shock and it scared me,

26:10.200 --> 26:12.019
and it's now making me think

26:12.029 --> 26:14.000
about not having that done.

26:14.009 --> 26:17.000
Buttock implants,

26:14.009 --> 26:17.000
I think you innately know

26:17.009 --> 26:19.180
that's a mistake.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.180
You had a giant complication.

26:19.190 --> 26:21.180
Now, if you put

26:19.190 --> 26:21.180
a buttock implant

26:21.190 --> 26:22.289
in there in the old pocket,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.220
that old pocket's

26:23.000 --> 26:24.220
all scarred down,

26:24.230 --> 26:26.279
probably got residual

26:24.230 --> 26:26.279
inflammation.

26:26.289 --> 26:28.049
If you put a buttock implant

26:26.289 --> 26:28.049
in there,

26:28.150 --> 26:29.170
the body's gonna go,

26:29.180 --> 26:31.240
"What the heck is this?"

26:31.250 --> 26:34.000
And even if you don't get

26:31.250 --> 26:34.000
an early infection,

26:34.009 --> 26:36.170
you will get an encapsulation

26:36.180 --> 26:37.240
which is scar tissue forming

26:37.250 --> 26:39.190
which could displace

26:37.250 --> 26:39.190
the implants--

26:39.200 --> 26:41.019
that's called malposition--

26:41.029 --> 26:42.220
or just turn them into rocks.

26:42.230 --> 26:43.220
- Rock hard--

26:42.230 --> 26:43.220
- Oh, no.

26:43.230 --> 26:47.049
Yeah. Bad idea, Tamara.

26:47.150 --> 26:48.190
Bad, bad, bad, bad.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.069
Huge bad. Big mistake.

26:50.079 --> 26:52.279
It really would

26:50.079 --> 26:52.279
mess you up, okay?

26:52.289 --> 26:54.279
Now let's talk

26:52.289 --> 26:54.279
about those scars.

26:54.289 --> 26:57.269
What he has taught me is that

26:54.289 --> 26:57.269
there's really good ways

26:57.279 --> 27:00.059
to deal with those scars

26:57.279 --> 27:00.059
using micro needling

27:00.160 --> 27:02.049
and lasers, okay?

27:02.059 --> 27:04.079
And those are done

27:02.059 --> 27:04.079
all over Beverly Hills.

27:04.089 --> 27:06.190
You could do them in his office.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.230
You can do them

27:06.200 --> 27:08.230
in any plastic surgeon's office

27:08.240 --> 27:11.170
- in Beverly Hills.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.170
- That is definitely something

27:11.180 --> 27:13.220
I understand,

27:11.180 --> 27:13.220
because it's visible.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.180
All the other stuff,

27:13.230 --> 27:15.180
you gotta stay away from.

27:15.190 --> 27:17.029
It's gonna be with you

27:15.190 --> 27:17.029
the rest of your life

27:17.039 --> 27:19.069
and it will ruin your life.

27:19.079 --> 27:21.039
We've seen it too many times.

27:21.049 --> 27:23.079
That's how I feel

27:21.049 --> 27:23.079
with the butt implants.

27:23.089 --> 27:24.289
Big, big mistake, huge.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.279
So I don't want the same

27:25.000 --> 27:26.279
to happen,

27:26.289 --> 27:29.259
which seems like it would be

27:26.289 --> 27:29.259
more severe with my ribs.

27:29.269 --> 27:31.250
DR. DUBROW: Thank you.

27:29.269 --> 27:31.250
It would be more severe.

27:31.259 --> 27:33.069
I will take their advice.

27:33.170 --> 27:35.039
I'll give my body a break

27:35.049 --> 27:36.220
and I won't have

27:35.049 --> 27:36.220
those surgeries.

27:36.230 --> 27:38.059
- Thank you.

27:36.230 --> 27:38.059
- Pleasure.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.190
- Nice meeting you.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.190
- Nice to meet you, thank you.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.289
For now.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.170
Let's go shopping,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.170
Vacation, Rodeo, Urth Café.

27:44.180 --> 27:45.069
Let's spend money

27:44.180 --> 27:45.069
different ways.

27:45.259 --> 27:47.009
Let's not do any more surgery.

27:47.019 --> 27:48.259
Okay. I agree.

27:48.269 --> 27:51.259
[music]

27:55.000 --> 27:56.200
Listen, I'm a little exhausted,

27:55.000 --> 27:56.200
I'll be honest with you,

27:56.210 --> 27:59.000
I just read

27:59.009 --> 28:01.259
your entire past

27:59.009 --> 28:01.259
medical history in here.

28:01.269 --> 28:03.269
- My storybook.

28:01.269 --> 28:03.269
- Yeah.

28:03.279 --> 28:06.200
This is the story

28:03.279 --> 28:06.200
of your breasts right here.

28:06.210 --> 28:08.250
- We're in a tough situation.

28:06.210 --> 28:08.250
- Right.

28:08.259 --> 28:11.099
DR. DUBROW: So the biggest

28:08.259 --> 28:11.099
problem with Jodi

28:11.109 --> 28:14.000
is that she's had

28:11.109 --> 28:14.000
so many previous operations

28:14.009 --> 28:16.079
that the blood supply

28:16.180 --> 28:18.220
isn't good to the tissue.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.079
Very daunting,

28:18.230 --> 28:20.079
very challenging,

28:20.180 --> 28:22.150
and to be honest,

28:20.180 --> 28:22.150
I'm not sure it's gonna work.

28:27.269 --> 28:29.099
Today for Jodi's surgery

28:29.109 --> 28:31.009
I will start

28:29.109 --> 28:31.009
by making incisions

28:31.019 --> 28:33.039
below her areolas

28:31.019 --> 28:33.039
and inspect the quality

28:33.049 --> 28:34.259
of the tissue

28:33.049 --> 28:34.259
inside her breasts.

28:34.269 --> 28:36.069
I will release her muscle

28:36.079 --> 28:38.079
and then lower

28:36.079 --> 28:38.079
her inframammary crease

28:38.089 --> 28:40.069
to give her

28:38.089 --> 28:40.069
a normal appearing contour

28:40.079 --> 28:42.210
on the lower portion

28:40.079 --> 28:42.210
of her breasts.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.240
Finally, I will insert

28:42.220 --> 28:44.240
small implants

28:44.250 --> 28:47.039
that hopefully

28:44.250 --> 28:47.039
Jodi's body will accept.

28:47.049 --> 28:50.079
All right. So, it's just

28:47.049 --> 28:50.079
blanket of scar right now.

28:50.180 --> 28:52.220
No discernable tissue

28:50.180 --> 28:52.220
plane yet.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.029
That's very stiff tissue.

28:55.039 --> 28:57.069
All right, Well, I found

28:55.039 --> 28:57.069
the sub-macular plane.

28:57.079 --> 28:59.069
We're definitely below

28:57.079 --> 28:59.069
the muscle. Here's the muscle.

28:59.079 --> 29:00.109
- NURSE: Mm-hmm.

28:59.079 --> 29:00.109
- It's a little high

29:00.119 --> 29:02.049
but I'll get some coverage

29:00.119 --> 29:02.049
with it.

29:02.059 --> 29:05.049
It can help protect

29:02.059 --> 29:05.049
the surrounding tissue,

29:05.059 --> 29:06.259
minimize the chance

29:05.059 --> 29:06.259
of a complication.

29:06.269 --> 29:09.099
Jodi's tissue

29:06.269 --> 29:09.099
is better than I thought

29:09.200 --> 29:12.099
but at the end of the day

29:09.200 --> 29:12.099
it's still not great.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.220
And if it weren't for her

29:12.200 --> 29:14.220
overall level

29:14.230 --> 29:16.220
of fitness

29:16.230 --> 29:20.119
and pectoralis muscle

29:16.230 --> 29:20.119
development,

29:20.130 --> 29:22.220
I don't think this operation

29:22.230 --> 29:24.019
would be nearly as possible

29:24.029 --> 29:26.059
as it seems to be at this point.

29:26.069 --> 29:29.269
I'd say the trickiest part

29:26.069 --> 29:29.269
is how much can I lower

29:29.279 --> 29:31.259
this inframammary crease,

29:31.269 --> 29:33.279
not get a double bubble

29:33.289 --> 29:36.029
and not weaken it so much

29:36.039 --> 29:37.279
that post-operatively, it'll

29:37.289 --> 29:39.240
just fall into the abdomen?

29:39.250 --> 29:42.029
You don't wanna go

29:39.250 --> 29:42.029
to Double Bubbleville,

29:42.039 --> 29:44.029
because once you get

29:42.039 --> 29:44.029
to Double Bubbleville,

29:44.039 --> 29:46.099
you may never come back

29:46.200 --> 29:48.230
and you live

29:46.200 --> 29:48.230
in Double Bubbleville

29:48.240 --> 29:51.049
forever

29:48.240 --> 29:51.049
and you're ----ed.

29:51.059 --> 29:52.130
All right, let's put a 300

29:51.059 --> 29:52.130
and see if that works

29:52.140 --> 29:54.029
or that's too big.

29:54.039 --> 29:55.099
This is definitely one

29:54.039 --> 29:55.099
of those cases

29:55.109 --> 29:57.079
that could look okay

29:55.109 --> 29:57.079
when we lie her down

29:57.089 --> 29:59.259
but then when we sit her up,

29:57.089 --> 29:59.259
it's a total disaster.

29:59.269 --> 30:02.099
Finding the right size

29:59.269 --> 30:02.099
implant is really tricky

30:02.109 --> 30:03.220
in Jodi's case.

30:05.130 --> 30:06.130
You think that's too big?

30:06.230 --> 30:09.109
NURSE: Yes.

30:06.230 --> 30:09.109
- Huh.

30:09.210 --> 30:11.279
Boy, that's

30:09.210 --> 30:11.279
a short goddamn distance.

30:11.289 --> 30:13.029
Because of the short distance

30:13.039 --> 30:15.019
between the areola

30:15.029 --> 30:17.029
and the inframammary crease

30:17.039 --> 30:19.130
her risk of a double bubble

30:17.039 --> 30:19.130
is very high.

30:19.140 --> 30:22.140
Therefore, I'm gonna choose

30:19.140 --> 30:22.140
a 270 CC implant

30:22.150 --> 30:23.289
which I think will give her

30:24.000 --> 30:25.289
sort of the best

30:24.000 --> 30:25.289
of both worlds.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.039
Maximal shape and minimal risk

30:28.049 --> 30:29.140
of that double bubble.

30:29.150 --> 30:31.039
- Whoa.

30:29.150 --> 30:31.039
- NURSE: Mm-hmm.

30:31.049 --> 30:34.029
That's kind of rock star.

30:34.039 --> 30:35.240
Okay. Let's put her down,

30:35.250 --> 30:37.099
let's close,

30:37.109 --> 30:40.130
and let's, like, say a prayer.

30:40.140 --> 30:42.059
I think for a firefighter

30:40.140 --> 30:42.059
she may end up,

30:42.069 --> 30:43.130
you know,

30:43.140 --> 30:45.039
smoking hot. Huh?

30:46.289 --> 30:48.150
Let's see what it looks

30:46.289 --> 30:48.150
like today.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.019
Whenever I unwrap

30:48.160 --> 30:51.019
a patient like Jodi

30:51.029 --> 30:53.259
who's had some really

30:51.029 --> 30:53.259
high-risk surgery,

30:53.269 --> 30:55.240
I'm always a little concerned

30:55.250 --> 30:58.029
that it's gonna be a peek

30:55.250 --> 30:58.029
and shriek.

30:59.289 --> 31:02.019
Look at that big tip graft.

30:59.289 --> 31:02.019
That's from rib.

31:02.029 --> 31:04.230
That was used in the past.

31:02.029 --> 31:04.230
It's huge.

31:13.269 --> 31:13.279

you're gonna have

31:14.150 --> 31:15.099
a new nose soon, huh?

31:16.109 --> 31:17.250
Might sound kind of weird

31:16.109 --> 31:17.250
but I've had this nose

31:17.259 --> 31:20.289
for my whole life.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.130
So I'm kind of afraid

31:21.000 --> 31:23.130

Mr. David, I got

31:30.089 --> 31:32.250
some new news for you.

31:32.259 --> 31:34.109
- Okay.

31:32.259 --> 31:34.109
- Dr. Peng and Dr. Leader

31:34.119 --> 31:36.099
and I, we did our research

31:36.109 --> 31:39.019
and we've actually operated

31:36.109 --> 31:39.019
on numerous patients

31:39.029 --> 31:41.000
that had some

31:39.029 --> 31:41.000
of the same findings

31:41.009 --> 31:42.289
- you have.

31:41.009 --> 31:42.289
- Okay.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.269
There's something called

31:43.000 --> 31:44.269
a bifid nose.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.250
David is what we call

31:44.279 --> 31:46.250
a bifid cleft nose

31:46.259 --> 31:49.150
which means that the nose

31:46.259 --> 31:49.150
is actually split into two.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.140
And that's why it's very wide.

31:51.150 --> 31:53.150
So what I need to do

31:51.150 --> 31:53.150
is build up the right side

31:53.250 --> 31:55.250
to make the nose appear

31:53.250 --> 31:55.250
more symmetric.

31:55.259 --> 31:57.289
- So he's wide even here.

31:55.259 --> 31:57.289
- Mm-hmm.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.109
However, unfortunately,

31:59.119 --> 32:01.069
it's still gonna be

31:59.119 --> 32:01.069
a little wide

32:01.079 --> 32:03.069
but it's gonna look

32:01.079 --> 32:03.069
a lot better.

32:03.079 --> 32:05.259
And this bone feels

32:03.079 --> 32:05.259
like it's either pushed in

32:05.269 --> 32:08.119
or gone, so our goal

32:05.269 --> 32:08.119
is to build up

32:08.130 --> 32:10.119
the right side of your nose

32:10.130 --> 32:12.259
so we have to mold

32:10.130 --> 32:12.259
and kind of use some putty

32:12.269 --> 32:14.259
from your rib, basically.

32:14.269 --> 32:16.150
Pretty much, you know, I have

32:14.269 --> 32:16.150
to do some sculpturing in there.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
- Right.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
- All right.

32:17.259 --> 32:18.289
Do some artwork.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.059
We're gonna do it for you.

32:25.059 --> 32:26.119
For David's surgery

32:25.059 --> 32:26.119
I will start

32:26.130 --> 32:27.160
by opening the nose

32:27.170 --> 32:29.119
while Dr. Peng harvests rib.

32:29.130 --> 32:30.150
We will remove the rib

32:29.130 --> 32:30.150
that was used

32:30.160 --> 32:32.059
in his previous surgeries

32:32.069 --> 32:34.109
and then assess

32:32.069 --> 32:34.109
the anatomy of his nose.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.079
Next, we will fix

32:34.119 --> 32:36.079
his deviated septum

32:36.089 --> 32:38.150
to open his airway

32:36.089 --> 32:38.150
and use spreader grafts

32:38.250 --> 32:40.029
to push out

32:38.250 --> 32:40.029
the collapsed bone

32:40.039 --> 32:41.150
on the right side

32:40.039 --> 32:41.150
of his nose.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.289
Next we will use

32:41.250 --> 32:43.289
a septal extension graft

32:44.000 --> 32:45.279
to lengthen the tip

32:44.000 --> 32:45.279
and finally

32:45.289 --> 32:47.269
a right alar batten graft

32:47.279 --> 32:49.150
to add structure

32:47.279 --> 32:49.150
to his nasal valve,

32:49.259 --> 32:51.089
hopefully leaving David

32:51.099 --> 32:53.150
with a more

32:51.099 --> 32:53.150
normal-looking nose.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.009
You know,

32:53.160 --> 32:55.009
when you have patients

32:55.019 --> 32:57.049
with congenital abnormalities

32:55.019 --> 32:57.049
like this,

32:57.059 --> 32:58.170
it's just interesting

32:58.180 --> 33:01.009
to find out, okay,

32:58.180 --> 33:01.009
what anatomy is there.

33:01.019 --> 33:03.130
Look at that big tip graft.

33:01.019 --> 33:03.130
That's from rib.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.140
It's huge.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.140
Give me those scissors.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.119
So it's gonna be coming out,

33:07.130 --> 33:10.079
the piece of the rib

33:07.130 --> 33:10.079
that was used in the past.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.269
That's an old piece of rib.

33:11.279 --> 33:14.079
Remember this rib

33:11.279 --> 33:14.079
was taken as a child.

33:14.089 --> 33:16.170
It almost appears

33:14.089 --> 33:16.170
that the right nasal bone

33:16.180 --> 33:19.130
was there, it developed,

33:16.180 --> 33:19.130
but it stopped at a certain age.

33:19.140 --> 33:22.049
It's almost like

33:19.140 --> 33:22.049
immature baby bones.

33:22.059 --> 33:24.170
Surprisingly,

33:22.059 --> 33:24.170
David has some anatomy

33:24.180 --> 33:26.079
that is kind of normal.

33:26.089 --> 33:29.009
Albeit the bones

33:26.089 --> 33:29.009
are very small and narrow,

33:29.019 --> 33:30.009
but they're there.

33:30.019 --> 33:31.160
On the right side,

33:31.170 --> 33:34.039
and this is the side

33:31.170 --> 33:34.039
that's really deviated.

33:34.049 --> 33:36.180
All right. Take that.

33:36.279 --> 33:39.089
Here's another piece of bone.

33:39.099 --> 33:42.049
That was the part

33:39.099 --> 33:42.049
that was actually touching

33:42.059 --> 33:43.180
the lateral nasal wall.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.039
I hope by removing this,

33:45.049 --> 33:46.079
this is gonna relieve

33:45.049 --> 33:46.079
and get rid

33:46.089 --> 33:47.130
of all of his headaches.

33:47.140 --> 33:49.150
Okay. Deviated septum

33:49.160 --> 33:51.099
beautifully taken care of.

33:51.109 --> 33:54.089
So, let's see how good

33:51.109 --> 33:54.089
your rib cartilage is.

33:54.099 --> 33:57.009
It's time for Dr. Peng and I

33:54.099 --> 33:57.009
to unload

33:57.019 --> 33:59.109
our deluge of nasal grafts.

33:59.119 --> 34:02.019
David needs the entire right

33:59.119 --> 34:02.019
side of the nose

34:02.029 --> 34:03.190
so he's getting the works.

34:03.289 --> 34:06.180
We're gonna need a thin right

34:03.289 --> 34:06.180
alar batten graft.

34:06.190 --> 34:08.179
- DR. PENG: I made one.

34:06.190 --> 34:08.179
- Good, put it in there.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.079
Straighten that piece that out

34:08.280 --> 34:10.079
and then you'll stitch.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.170
Good, good.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.170
Good, good, good.

34:11.269 --> 34:13.179
The septum is straight,

34:13.190 --> 34:16.139
tip color looks good,

34:13.190 --> 34:16.139
and I'm fairly happy.

34:16.150 --> 34:18.039
It looks pretty great.

34:18.050 --> 34:20.050
- DR. PENG: I agree.

34:18.050 --> 34:20.050
- Well, thank you all.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.150
- DR. PENG: Thank you.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.150
- SHERRY: Thank you, Dr. Nassif.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.130
[music]

34:27.070 --> 34:28.280
- DR. DUBROW: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:27.070 --> 34:28.280
- DR. NASSIF: Come here.

34:28.289 --> 34:30.170
Again? Something more?

34:30.179 --> 34:32.170
- Come on in.

34:30.179 --> 34:32.170
- Oh, my God.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.139
- Uh, what is he--

34:32.179 --> 34:34.139
- ERICA: Come on in.

34:34.150 --> 34:35.199
DR. NASSIF: He has no clue

34:34.150 --> 34:35.199
what we're doing.

34:35.210 --> 34:37.099
Are you--are you next

34:35.210 --> 34:37.099
after this?

34:37.110 --> 34:39.059
- Are you doing microblading?

34:37.110 --> 34:39.059
- ERICA: Yes.

34:39.070 --> 34:40.199
Oh, my--all right,

34:39.070 --> 34:40.199
let's go ahead.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.190
I got, you know, a young wife.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.190
I gotta look good.

34:42.289 --> 34:45.119
Ever since I got

34:42.289 --> 34:45.119
my wedding photos,

34:45.130 --> 34:47.050
as I'm looking

34:45.130 --> 34:47.050
at my beautiful bride,

34:47.059 --> 34:48.190
what do you think

34:47.059 --> 34:48.190
I'm looking at?

34:48.199 --> 34:51.010
I'm looking

34:48.199 --> 34:51.010
at my short eyebrows.

34:51.019 --> 34:53.099
Hey, it's okay to be metro.

34:53.110 --> 34:55.010
I like looking good.

34:55.019 --> 34:56.170
Looks like he needs

34:55.019 --> 34:56.170
eyebrow trimming.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.079
- Oh, I need that too.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.079
- ERICA: We can do that too.

34:58.090 --> 34:59.289
What I do is I just try

34:58.090 --> 34:59.289
to keep it as natural

35:00.000 --> 35:02.059
- as possible.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.059
- Erica, natural

35:02.070 --> 35:03.110
left the building

35:03.119 --> 35:05.210
like 10 years ago.

35:05.219 --> 35:07.130
What's next, scrotal botox?

35:07.139 --> 35:08.170
Testicular tinting?

35:08.179 --> 35:09.210
It's a perfect color.

35:09.219 --> 35:11.059
Like, a perfect slight pink.

35:11.070 --> 35:12.190
Ew.

35:12.199 --> 35:14.139
And how often guys

35:12.199 --> 35:14.139
with this much hair

35:14.150 --> 35:16.090
- come in for this?

35:14.150 --> 35:16.090
- It's very rare.

35:16.099 --> 35:18.030
- Yeah.

35:16.099 --> 35:18.030
- Having a good set

35:18.039 --> 35:20.019
of full eyebrows,

35:20.030 --> 35:21.159
that really makes you

35:20.030 --> 35:21.159
look younger.

35:21.170 --> 35:23.190
If by making you look younger

35:23.289 --> 35:26.070
you mean

35:23.289 --> 35:26.070
"make you look ridiculous,"

35:26.079 --> 35:27.179
oh, oh, it's working.

35:27.190 --> 35:29.190
Congratulations on your new, uh,

35:29.199 --> 35:31.179
eyebrow fullness.

35:31.190 --> 35:32.190
[smooches] Love you, baby.

35:41.030 --> 35:42.119
- Thank you.

35:42.130 --> 35:44.110

- You got a makeup on?

35:44.119 --> 35:45.219
- No.

35:47.130 --> 35:49.119
You look like

35:47.130 --> 35:49.119
you just went to a spa.

35:49.130 --> 35:50.119
I do feel different.

35:50.130 --> 35:52.199
I feel like I have breasts.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.059
I don't know

35:53.000 --> 35:54.059
what they look like

35:54.070 --> 35:56.059
but they're there.

35:54.070 --> 35:56.059
I just can't wait

35:56.070 --> 35:58.219
until the bandages come off

35:56.070 --> 35:58.219
and I can see what's going on.

35:58.230 --> 36:00.199
- I got projection.

35:58.230 --> 36:00.199
- Mm-hmm.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.099
I got size and the chances

36:03.110 --> 36:05.070
that it'll start falling

36:03.110 --> 36:05.070
into your abdomen

36:05.079 --> 36:07.210
- has been minimized.

36:05.079 --> 36:07.210
- All right.

36:08.010 --> 36:10.110
- That all sounds good. It's--

36:08.010 --> 36:10.110
- It sounds good.

36:10.119 --> 36:12.050
Let's see what it looks

36:10.119 --> 36:12.050
like today.

36:12.059 --> 36:14.130
Whenever I unwrap

36:12.059 --> 36:14.130
a patient like Jodi

36:14.139 --> 36:17.110
who's had some

36:14.139 --> 36:17.110
really high-risk surgery,

36:17.119 --> 36:19.059
I'm always a little concerned

36:19.070 --> 36:22.030
that I'm gonna unwrap her

36:22.039 --> 36:23.130
and basically it's gonna be

36:23.139 --> 36:26.130
a massive peek and shriek,

36:26.139 --> 36:28.039
except the shrieking

36:28.050 --> 36:29.139
will be by me.

36:29.150 --> 36:32.099
So here's--here it is.

36:32.110 --> 36:34.179
Yeah. See this one's perfect.

36:34.190 --> 36:37.139
I'm--I'm literally speechless.

36:37.150 --> 36:38.230
That's a nice thing to hear.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.159
I just--I literally

36:38.239 --> 36:41.159
had no words.

36:41.170 --> 36:44.090
It's better than--

36:41.170 --> 36:44.090
than I ever expected.

36:44.099 --> 36:45.230
Right now we're in

36:44.099 --> 36:45.230
a great spot, right now.

36:46.030 --> 36:48.150
Okay.

36:48.159 --> 36:50.070
- I know.

36:48.159 --> 36:50.070
- And I'm so happy

36:50.079 --> 36:51.230
with the results right now.

36:52.030 --> 36:53.199
I-I--I'll wrap myself

36:53.210 --> 36:55.199
in bubble wrap if I have to.

36:55.210 --> 36:58.150
I am not letting

36:55.210 --> 36:58.150
this surgery fail.

36:58.159 --> 37:01.110
I'm just so thankful.

37:07.079 --> 37:08.219
- DR. NASSIF: Well, how are you?

37:07.079 --> 37:08.219
- SHERRY: Hey, guys.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.159
- DAVID: I'm doing well.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.159
- Tell us how you're feeling.

37:10.170 --> 37:12.210
I feel like I got punched

37:10.170 --> 37:12.210
in the gut right here.

37:12.219 --> 37:14.079
It's been painful.

37:14.090 --> 37:16.079
I've been feeling

37:14.090 --> 37:16.079
all my 51 years.

37:16.090 --> 37:18.239
Here, not so great,

37:16.090 --> 37:18.239
but here, very thankful.

37:19.050 --> 37:23.150
But honestly it's more--

37:19.050 --> 37:23.150
I feel good mentally.

37:23.159 --> 37:25.150
- DR. NASSIF: Breath for me.

37:23.159 --> 37:25.150
- [inhales]

37:25.159 --> 37:27.199
- DR. NASSIF: Can you breathe?

37:25.159 --> 37:27.199
- I'll tell you right now

37:27.210 --> 37:29.210
the first thing I noticed

37:29.219 --> 37:31.159
was for the first time

37:29.219 --> 37:31.159
in my life

37:31.170 --> 37:33.210
I felt air

37:33.219 --> 37:35.099
jetting through that nostril.

37:35.110 --> 37:36.170
- Nice.

37:35.110 --> 37:36.170
- Jetting is right.

37:36.179 --> 37:37.230
It startled me,

37:36.179 --> 37:37.230
to be honest with you.

37:38.030 --> 37:39.150
- It startled me.

37:38.030 --> 37:39.150
- DR. DUBROW: Really?

37:39.159 --> 37:40.239
So let me--you can go ahead

37:39.159 --> 37:40.239
and cover that.

37:41.039 --> 37:42.079
So when I went in there

37:42.090 --> 37:43.230
it was really bad.

37:44.030 --> 37:45.110
The boney vault

37:44.030 --> 37:45.110
in the middle vault

37:45.119 --> 37:46.159
was all the way in.

37:46.170 --> 37:48.210
So I was able to fix the septum

37:48.219 --> 37:50.139
and rebuild the middle part

37:48.219 --> 37:50.139
of your nose.

37:50.150 --> 37:51.210
And then we're hoping

37:51.219 --> 37:52.260
that the headaches may go away.

37:52.269 --> 37:54.099
- We don't know yet.

37:52.269 --> 37:54.099
- Okay.

37:54.110 --> 37:56.159
So tell us your thoughts

37:54.110 --> 37:56.159
about this.

37:56.170 --> 37:57.260
I'm elated.

37:58.059 --> 38:00.139
Our paths crossed

37:58.059 --> 38:00.139
for a very short amount of time

38:00.150 --> 38:02.260
but you guys changed

38:00.150 --> 38:02.260
my life, really.

38:03.059 --> 38:05.199
I hope that, after this is done,

38:05.210 --> 38:07.079
comes off,

38:07.090 --> 38:09.210
you guys go out

38:07.090 --> 38:09.210
to a beautiful restaurant,

38:09.219 --> 38:11.159
have nice dinner and feel good

38:11.170 --> 38:12.250
- about everything.

38:11.170 --> 38:12.250
- Absolutely.

38:13.050 --> 38:15.210
That would be

38:13.050 --> 38:15.210
made even that much better

38:15.219 --> 38:17.260
- if you picked up the check.

38:15.219 --> 38:17.260
- [laughter ]

38:17.269 --> 38:19.139
Well, you know, Denny's does

38:17.269 --> 38:19.139
have some great meals.

38:19.150 --> 38:20.250
- That's true.

38:19.150 --> 38:20.250
- They'll want to make you

38:20.260 --> 38:22.119
breakfast instead.

38:22.130 --> 38:25.139
The Two Plus Two Plus Two.

38:25.150 --> 38:27.219
DAVID: This whole story

38:25.150 --> 38:27.219
started when I was in the womb.

38:27.230 --> 38:30.070
My nose didn't look

38:27.230 --> 38:30.070
like everybody else's.

38:30.079 --> 38:32.230
Now my nose definitely

38:30.079 --> 38:32.230
looks a lot better/

38:32.239 --> 38:34.260
It makes me feel a lot better

38:34.269 --> 38:36.079
and that's the best thing.

38:36.090 --> 38:37.219
Before my surgery

38:37.230 --> 38:39.079
I was completely

38:37.230 --> 38:39.079
stripped of my breasts.

38:39.090 --> 38:41.070
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

38:41.079 --> 38:42.190
I just finally feel free.

38:55.139 --> 38:57.260
My mother had an IUD

38:55.139 --> 38:57.260
when I was born

38:58.070 --> 39:00.269
and my nose didn't look

38:58.070 --> 39:00.269
like everybody else's.

39:01.079 --> 39:03.269
All along I was told

39:01.079 --> 39:03.269
that it was the IUD

39:03.280 --> 39:05.130
that caused the problem.

39:05.139 --> 39:06.269
Dr. Nassif shed light

39:06.280 --> 39:09.150
on my unique

39:06.280 --> 39:09.150
congenital diagnosis.

39:09.159 --> 39:10.280
And now, my nose

39:11.079 --> 39:13.130
definitely looks a lot better.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.219

39:23.280 --> 39:26.219
- Yeah.

39:26.230 --> 39:29.260
Before my surgery my nose

39:26.230 --> 39:29.260
was absolute trash.

39:29.269 --> 39:31.139
It wasn't symmetrical,

39:31.150 --> 39:32.280
it was shifted to the left.

39:32.289 --> 39:34.159
I couldn't breathe

39:32.289 --> 39:34.159
and I was having

39:34.170 --> 39:35.280
horrible headaches.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.190
Hated looking in the mirror

39:37.199 --> 39:39.280
and I thought

39:37.199 --> 39:39.280
that my deformed nose

39:39.289 --> 39:42.110
was all that people would see

39:39.289 --> 39:42.110
when they'd look at me.

39:42.119 --> 39:44.159
But now,

39:42.119 --> 39:44.159
not only did Dr. Nassif

39:44.170 --> 39:45.280
give me a symmetrical,

39:45.289 --> 39:47.280
functional,

39:45.289 --> 39:47.280
and good-looking nose,

39:47.289 --> 39:50.280
but I'm no longer

39:47.289 --> 39:50.280
the family IUDisaster.

39:51.079 --> 39:52.199
[laughs]

39:52.210 --> 39:54.099
Well, I've noticed since

39:52.210 --> 39:54.099
the surgery, I think

39:54.110 --> 39:56.150
your quality of life

39:54.110 --> 39:56.150
has definitely improved.

39:56.159 --> 39:58.090
You haven't had

39:56.159 --> 39:58.090
one headache since August.

39:58.099 --> 39:59.289
- Right.

39:58.099 --> 39:59.289
- So that's--that in itself

40:00.090 --> 40:01.260
- was worth more than anything.

40:00.090 --> 40:01.260
- Oh, that--yeah.

40:01.269 --> 40:04.150
Really that was the--

40:01.269 --> 40:04.150
the most worth it part for me.

40:04.159 --> 40:06.170
- That was my--

40:04.159 --> 40:06.170
- So thank you for pushing me

40:06.179 --> 40:07.289
to do something about it.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.219
I'm grateful

40:08.000 --> 40:09.219
that you're just happier

40:09.230 --> 40:11.199
and pain-free, to be honest.

40:11.210 --> 40:13.079
Unfortunately

40:11.210 --> 40:13.079

40:14.150 --> 40:15.099
he's not gonna be

40:14.150 --> 40:15.099
at the disco dancing on tables

40:15.280 --> 40:16.139
as much as Dr. Dubrow

40:17.050 --> 40:17.280
was hoping that would happen.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.159
But he is who is.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.159
I've been married to him

40:20.119 --> 40:21.219
for 25 years.

40:20.119 --> 40:21.219
I'll stay married to him

40:22.239 --> 40:24.190
for another 25

40:22.239 --> 40:24.190
even if he doesn't disco dance.

40:24.199 --> 40:26.159
You know, all these years

40:24.199 --> 40:26.159
I've kind of had this buffer

40:26.170 --> 40:28.280
of the reason to my nose,

40:29.079 --> 40:31.099
and always kind of played it off

40:31.110 --> 40:33.150
as like, well,

40:31.110 --> 40:33.150
it's not really a defect.

40:33.159 --> 40:35.159
It's not birth defect,

40:33.159 --> 40:35.159
it's something that just...

40:35.170 --> 40:37.179
- I know.

40:35.170 --> 40:37.179
- ...was there and it happened.

40:37.190 --> 40:39.280
- Right.

40:37.190 --> 40:39.280
- And then here we are

40:39.289 --> 40:41.179
- 50 years later--

40:39.289 --> 40:41.179
- I know.

40:41.190 --> 40:43.250
- --and you know it just got...

40:41.190 --> 40:43.250
- And your story got

40:43.260 --> 40:44.230
- turned upside down.

40:43.260 --> 40:44.230
- The story got turned

40:44.239 --> 40:46.159
completely up on its head.

40:46.170 --> 40:48.280
Even though it kind of stung

40:46.170 --> 40:48.280
maybe at the moment,

40:48.289 --> 40:50.230
I've kind of gotten over it.

40:50.239 --> 40:53.159
The reality

40:50.239 --> 40:53.159
is the underlying structure

40:53.170 --> 40:55.150
- was what it was.

40:53.170 --> 40:55.150
- Right.

40:55.159 --> 40:58.110
And Dr. Nassif

40:55.159 --> 40:58.110
fixed that problem.

40:58.119 --> 40:59.150
- Yes.

40:58.119 --> 40:59.150
- He finished the job.

40:59.159 --> 41:01.000
I was skeptical at first

41:01.010 --> 41:03.110
and just everybody,

41:01.010 --> 41:03.110
kind of, pushed

41:03.119 --> 41:05.230
and did all of this for me.

41:05.239 --> 41:07.269
And I'm ready

41:05.239 --> 41:07.269
to move on from here.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.289
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif,

41:10.090 --> 41:12.179
I can't even explain

41:10.090 --> 41:12.179
how grateful I am.

41:12.190 --> 41:14.159
Thank you.

41:14.170 --> 41:16.010
SHERRY: Oh, no, how much is it?

41:16.110 --> 41:18.000
Oh, wow. Aw.

41:18.010 --> 41:20.139
Dr. Nassif actually

41:18.010 --> 41:20.139
is picking up the tab...

41:20.150 --> 41:21.139
- DAVID: Yes.

41:20.150 --> 41:21.139
- ...for our anniversary dinner.

41:21.150 --> 41:22.210
Isn't that incredible?

41:22.219 --> 41:24.010
How sweet.

41:22.219 --> 41:24.010
Dr. Nassif's paying,

41:24.019 --> 41:25.010
we should order another bottle.

41:25.019 --> 41:26.150
[both laugh]

41:26.159 --> 41:28.199
[music]

41:28.210 --> 41:30.119
[indistinct chatter]

41:30.130 --> 41:32.230
[laughs]

41:32.239 --> 41:34.260
JODI: Looking back at the past

41:32.239 --> 41:34.260
fifteen surgeries,

41:34.269 --> 41:36.289
going from having

41:34.269 --> 41:36.289
really large natural breasts

41:37.000 --> 41:39.139
to losing all of that

41:37.000 --> 41:39.139
and having

41:39.150 --> 41:41.230
really large implants,

41:39.150 --> 41:41.230
having them both removed,

41:41.239 --> 41:44.010
all the failed surgeries,

41:41.239 --> 41:44.010
this is the one thing

41:44.110 --> 41:46.219
that's been holding me back

41:44.110 --> 41:46.219
for the past seven years.

41:46.230 --> 41:48.150
I never thought I would

41:46.230 --> 41:48.150
be able to look down

41:48.159 --> 41:49.239
and see breasts again.

41:49.250 --> 41:51.019
That suit is killer,

41:51.119 --> 41:52.260
- I love it.

41:51.119 --> 41:52.260
- JODI: Thank you guys.

41:52.269 --> 41:54.210
I worked super hard

41:52.269 --> 41:54.210
to get my body

41:54.219 --> 41:56.130
to where it's at

41:54.219 --> 41:56.130
and it's so nice

41:56.139 --> 41:59.019
to finally have

41:56.139 --> 41:59.019
a beautiful chest to match.

41:59.030 --> 42:00.139
[yelps]

42:00.150 --> 42:02.289
I just finally feel free.

your body looks.

42:16.199 --> 42:17.190
Oh, thank you.

42:17.199 --> 42:18.219
Very Baywatch-y.

42:18.230 --> 42:20.150
[chuckles]

42:20.159 --> 42:22.010
Before my surgery,

42:20.159 --> 42:22.010
I was completely

42:22.019 --> 42:23.159
stripped of my breasts.

42:23.170 --> 42:24.219
I was left with nothing

42:23.170 --> 42:24.219
but skin

42:24.230 --> 42:26.190
and really bad scars.

42:26.199 --> 42:28.210
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

42:28.219 --> 42:30.030
I finally have breasts.

42:30.039 --> 42:31.139
They're the perfect size,

42:31.150 --> 42:33.030
my scars are minimized.

42:33.039 --> 42:35.170
Now I even feel sexy

42:33.039 --> 42:35.170
when I'm in my uniform,

42:35.179 --> 42:38.030
I feel like a woman.

42:35.179 --> 42:38.030
My breasts are amazing.

42:38.039 --> 42:40.030
It's not perfect but no more

42:40.039 --> 42:42.030
at level four disaster here.

42:42.039 --> 42:44.010
My breasts are looking great.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.159
You can just tell you

42:44.019 --> 42:45.159
don't have this, like, weight

42:45.170 --> 42:46.239
on your shoulders anymore

42:46.250 --> 42:48.219
and it's so nice to see you

42:48.230 --> 42:51.159
stop having to hit, you know,

42:48.230 --> 42:51.159
pause on your life finally.

42:51.170 --> 42:53.260
- I'm finally dating again.

42:51.170 --> 42:53.260
- Excited for you.

42:53.269 --> 42:56.219
I mean, you have a lot

42:53.269 --> 42:56.219
to show off now.

42:56.230 --> 42:58.030
You'll be like two seconds

42:56.230 --> 42:58.030
until you're like,

42:58.039 --> 43:00.179
- "Let's get naked."

42:58.039 --> 43:00.179
- Like, "Shirts off."

43:00.190 --> 43:03.170
Jodi just looks so good.

43:03.179 --> 43:05.190
She looks so hot.

43:03.179 --> 43:05.190
Like, the confidence

43:05.199 --> 43:07.230
just, like, is radiating

43:05.199 --> 43:07.230
out of her.

43:07.239 --> 43:09.179
She looks amazing.

43:09.190 --> 43:11.260
Come on, Jodi, it's like

43:09.190 --> 43:11.260
your firefighter training.

43:11.269 --> 43:13.260
I got you, don't worry.

43:13.269 --> 43:15.130
Let's go.

43:17.179 --> 43:19.050
I am the most plastic fantastic

43:19.150 --> 43:21.039
- sugar baby there is.

43:19.150 --> 43:21.039
- You want bigger lips

43:21.050 --> 43:22.269
- than you have now?

43:21.050 --> 43:22.269
- Much bigger. Double, yeah.

43:22.280 --> 43:25.050
Dr. Nassif is my type

43:22.280 --> 43:25.050
in a sugar daddy.

43:25.150 --> 43:28.039
Ooh, he's even cuter in person.

43:28.150 --> 43:30.050
It is not very often

43:28.150 --> 43:30.050
that we see things

43:30.150 --> 43:32.050
we've never seen before.

43:32.059 --> 43:33.159
- WOMAN: Oh, my God.

43:32.059 --> 43:33.159
- DR. DUBROW: Oh, my God.

43:33.170 --> 43:35.280
- Oh, the [bleep] is this?

43:33.170 --> 43:35.280
- Ooh.

43:35.289 --> 43:38.219
I've seen over 20 doctors.

43:38.230 --> 43:40.210
They've all said

43:38.230 --> 43:40.210
they can't help me.

43:40.219 --> 43:43.039
You may actually

43:40.219 --> 43:43.039
not be a candidate for surgery.

43:43.050 --> 43:45.199
You may have to live with this

43:43.050 --> 43:45.199
for the rest of your life.
