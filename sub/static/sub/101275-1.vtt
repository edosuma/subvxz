00:44.244 --> 00:47.580
He had a black cat named
Macak when he was a boy.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.879
The cat followed him everywhere.

00:58.466 --> 01:01.469
And one day,
when he stroked the cat's back...

01:02.220 --> 01:03.680
... he saw a miracle.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.560
Light crackled under his hand.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.565
His father explained that
the lightning in the sky...

01:13.731 --> 01:17.235
... is like the sparks that
flew from Macak's back.

01:18.361 --> 01:20.113
And Tesla wondered

01:23.366 --> 01:26.369
Is Nature a Giant Cat?

01:26.536 --> 01:27.829
And if so:

01:30.123 --> 01:32.041
Who is stroking his back then?

01:39.716 --> 01:43.094
<font color="#FFFF00">NINE YEARS BEFORE

01:43.219 --> 01:46.639
EDISON MACHINE WORKS,
NEW YORK AUGUST 11, 1884

01:52.937 --> 01:55.940
The power of the thought.
Isn't that all about?

01:56.107 --> 01:58.443
The candles are there in the cupboard, right?

01:59.402 --> 02:03.197
Eventually we will be
able to see in the dark.

02:03.364 --> 02:04.699
I found them.

02:04.824 --> 02:07.994
I think there are more in the messy drawer.
Do you know where it is?

02:10.788 --> 02:12.999
The messy drawer?

02:13.166 --> 02:17.045
Aren't there cluttered
drawers where you come from?

02:17.212 --> 02:19.672
My mom had a messy drawer.
And yours?

02:19.839 --> 02:21.591
Leave my mother out.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.511
Nobody expected you
to come tonight, Tom.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.681
No?  Not really?

02:28.848 --> 02:30.516
I expected it.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.940
When I was five years old...

02:37.982 --> 02:40.777
Ed, you don't have to
stop because I'm talking.

02:44.155 --> 02:47.659
When I was five years old,
we sailed across Lake Erie...

02:47.825 --> 02:51.579
... to visit the
Edisons in Vienna.

02:51.746 --> 02:53.873
Vienna, Ontario.

02:54.040 --> 02:59.629
Mother and father. My sisters Marion and
Tannie. My brother Charlie. Grandpa Sam.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.382
I learned to swim.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.760
When I was back in Ohio...

03:05.927 --> 03:09.055
... I went out with
my good friend George.

03:09.180 --> 03:10.473
George Lockwood.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.350
He was my age.

03:12.517 --> 03:17.772
We went to a canal near my house.
I entered the water and George followed me.

03:17.939 --> 03:21.901
Afterwards I went home.
I felt numb and went to bed.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.156
When my mother woke me
up, it was very dark.

03:27.323 --> 03:29.033
She asked me about George.

03:30.159 --> 03:33.204
Everyone was looking for him.
Half the city.

03:33.371 --> 03:37.750
They lit lanterns, shouted his
name, and searched everywhere.

03:37.917 --> 03:42.338
I told her I saw George's head
disappear under the water...

03:42.505 --> 03:44.966
... and that I had waited a long time for him.

03:45.133 --> 03:47.093
I didn't know what to do.

03:49.304 --> 03:50.972
I was five years old.

03:53.349 --> 03:55.602
Why did I have to think about that now?

03:55.768 --> 03:57.645
Go home, Tom.  I mean it.

03:58.563 --> 04:00.982
I always assume that
people can swim.

04:02.442 --> 04:05.945
Hello, Tesla.
I haven't seen you there before.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.825
Is it true that you are from Transylvania?

16:34.580 --> 16:35.979
My God.

16:36.478 --> 16:40.390
Do not discuss this with the
conditional officer or physician.

16:40.491 --> 16:43.629
- I'm not talking.
- You can't get out of your life.

16:45.175 --> 16:47.257
Do you think it will be alright?

16:49.523 --> 16:52.483
Listen, you've had a lot.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.179
How can it be, I can't imagine.

16:56.572 --> 17:00.020
But you cannot live in the past.

17:00.892 --> 17:04.320
You slept as much as possible, which is what happened.

17:05.740 --> 17:07.423
You have to look ahead.

17:08.220 --> 17:09.434
Yes.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.246
You're right.

17:14.574 --> 17:16.771
Everything will be fine.

17:17.141 --> 17:19.287
Come on, let's get out of here.

17:56.474 --> 17:59.479
Hey? - I'm glad you
turned on the phone.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.620
I said I would wear it.

18:03.835 --> 18:05.096
Well done, Mary.

18:05.883 --> 18:08.468
- I hope everything will be fine.
- Thank you.

18:08.632 --> 18:09.901
Bye.

18:26.276 --> 18:28.209
Yes, Tom?

18:28.521 --> 18:30.810
You watched my daughter die.

18:33.059 --> 18:35.882
I'm going to look
at your death now.

19:14.043 --> 19:16.043
Hi.

19:33.601 --> 19:35.577
Rain is expected tonight.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.787
Maria.

19:39.138 --> 19:41.267
We've talked about this before.

19:42.274 --> 19:44.965
You can't panic
every time it rains.

19:46.645 --> 19:49.747
Do you know the 50's
song "Raindrops"?

19:50.398 --> 19:51.987
No.

19:54.496 --> 19:56.496
Raindrops.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.103
Lots of raindrops.

20:00.762 --> 20:02.738
It's like raindrops...

20:02.763 --> 20:05.163
OK PLEASE. Stop saying.

20:05.756 --> 20:07.914
Yes, I know that song.

20:10.794 --> 20:14.726
James calls me when
it rains and...

20:16.169 --> 20:18.507
... he played that
number on the phone.

20:21.976 --> 20:24.778
I knew it would kill someone.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.735
God, that's a terrible thing.

20:32.755 --> 20:35.745
Is that why you don't want a phone?

20:37.729 --> 20:39.633
This is one of many reasons.

20:43.490 --> 20:46.779
You were the only one
with me at this time.

20:49.822 --> 20:53.373
I couldn't have done
this without you.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.769
So thank you.

20:58.643 --> 21:00.831
You do not have to thank me.

21:01.445 --> 21:04.882
We have been friends since the age of five.
You're like one of my family.

21:06.740 --> 21:09.009
I'll never turn my back on you.

21:10.757 --> 21:12.999
I know what everyone
is saying about me.

21:13.024 --> 21:15.220
What am I gonna say to them, you know?

21:15.692 --> 21:17.745
What? - Fuck you.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.296
Are you sure you
want to work here?

21:47.498 --> 21:49.498
I have no choice.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.504
This place is in a deserted place.

21:55.686 --> 21:58.221
I don't like you
being alone here.

21:58.566 --> 22:00.191
Nothing happens.

22:01.085 --> 22:03.169
What are you doing?

22:03.563 --> 22:07.319
I am coming too. How am I supposed
to see this scum from the inside?

22:24.532 --> 22:26.532
- Hi. - May I help you?

22:26.577 --> 22:28.108
Ben Mary.

22:29.359 --> 22:31.758
I was supposed to start tonight.

22:33.587 --> 22:36.096
Right, right.
Hi, my name is Bobby.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.491
- Hi. - Hi.

22:37.516 --> 22:39.664
- That's Deb. - Hey.

22:39.898 --> 22:42.704
- Do you sell beer?
- Yes, at the back.

22:45.248 --> 22:49.245
Ed said he was going to work at
a gas station for the first time.

22:49.405 --> 22:51.240
- Yes. - OK.

22:51.265 --> 22:54.350
It's quite simple.
So don't worry.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.995
- Do you want to come and see here?
- Yes.

22:59.929 --> 23:04.348
This cash register.
This is a barcode reader.

23:04.607 --> 23:08.425
You read the barcode and press
this button and this button.

23:08.547 --> 23:12.789
And those who buy gasoline must come in.
Because the pumps are old, not automatic.

23:14.506 --> 23:16.375
I'm also going to buy a pack of cigarettes.

23:16.619 --> 23:18.111
OK.

23:19.178 --> 23:21.554
Identity verification is
accurate because 12 at a time.

23:21.578 --> 23:24.258
... I was in trouble for selling
a cigarette to someone old.

23:24.552 --> 23:27.404
- Did you sell a cigarette
to a 12 year old boy? - Yes.

23:27.658 --> 23:31.283
Yes, but he had breasts.
So I am confused.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.506
Do you want to spend what you bought?

23:38.285 --> 23:40.540
- Of course. - Okay.

23:41.911 --> 23:44.099
Ask if he has a credit or debit card.

23:44.124 --> 23:46.201
Is that a credit or debit card?

23:46.237 --> 23:48.056
- ATM card. - OK.

23:48.967 --> 23:51.967
It keeps 9.75.

23:59.416 --> 24:02.455
You see, it's that simple.
Bravo.

24:02.502 --> 24:04.182
- Yes. - Okay.

24:04.207 --> 24:08.111
I'll get you a key and let
the rest of the shop go.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.935
- OK. - OK.

24:14.949 --> 24:16.491
Nice man.

24:16.608 --> 24:19.073
For someone who works at the gas station.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.860
Are you gonna stay here all night?

24:23.047 --> 24:25.016
No, I'm going.

24:25.117 --> 24:27.891
I wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

24:28.437 --> 24:30.218
Everything is alright.

24:31.147 --> 24:33.230
Then I'll call
you and check you.

24:33.255 --> 24:34.450
OK.

24:36.348 --> 24:38.005
And don't be too drunk.

24:38.322 --> 24:39.830
You have to pick me up at six.

24:39.859 --> 24:42.293
When was I so drunk?

24:48.472 --> 24:54.183
Translation: aytug2001

25:25.530 --> 25:26.995
Fuck!

25:51.887 --> 25:53.903
We only have five channels.

25:54.572 --> 25:57.843
No problem.
I won't be watching that much TV.

25:58.139 --> 26:03.993
Now it is, but you will be begging
to find a fictional series at 3am.

26:04.375 --> 26:06.094
Believe me.

26:06.353 --> 26:09.603
Okay.  Here are the keys to the store.

26:09.628 --> 26:12.947
This opens the round front
door, okay?

26:12.972 --> 26:16.791
So when you leave the market,
use it to lock the door.

26:16.904 --> 26:20.805
This weak one opens the
back door and the sink door.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.634
I always keep that door closed.

26:25.014 --> 26:26.544
What's that for?

26:27.366 --> 26:29.073
What do you think it's for?

26:29.650 --> 26:31.314
The sink outside?

26:32.864 --> 26:34.563
You learn fast.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.325
Well, I think this is enough.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.940
I think you are ready for your first night.

26:42.882 --> 26:46.499
It will be a stagnant night.
It is always on Monday.

26:53.889 --> 26:57.797
If you have a problem,
give me a call, okay?

26:58.182 --> 27:00.920
Edited everything later
in the evening...

27:00.944 --> 27:03.683
... wants me to
check that it's okay.

27:03.737 --> 27:06.565
- OK.
- Any other issues before you go?

27:09.413 --> 27:11.975
Has this place ever been robbed?

27:14.254 --> 27:17.295
Thing...

27:20.771 --> 27:22.873
Only by me.

27:23.580 --> 27:25.869
You can eat and drink anything you want.

27:25.963 --> 27:30.055
Just keep your hands
away from these babies.

27:30.103 --> 27:32.368
- I don't want to, thank you.
- OK.

27:32.513 --> 27:35.708
Ed doesn't know,
just throw the trash in the back.

27:38.421 --> 27:40.749
And if you smoke, smoke outside.

27:41.146 --> 27:42.389
OK.

27:44.638 --> 27:46.177
I think that's it.

27:46.648 --> 27:48.483
Goodbye, Mary.

27:48.617 --> 27:50.061
I will see.

27:53.502 --> 27:55.404
I hate the rain.

28:46.656 --> 28:48.023
Disgusting.

29:23.363 --> 29:25.051
The brain is ready.

29:26.757 --> 29:29.006
- The patient is also ready.
- Beautiful.

32:26.593 --> 32:27.921
Hi?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.041
Deer gas station. I am Mary.

33:29.066 --> 33:30.690
How long are you open until the evening?

33:31.035 --> 33:33.698
- We are open 24 hours.
- Thank you.

33:47.817 --> 33:51.027
- Deer gas station. I am Mary.
- How long are you open until the evening?

33:52.439 --> 33:54.282
Didn't you just call?

34:19.786 --> 34:21.811
Deer gas station.  I am Mary.

34:22.070 --> 34:23.844
How long are you open until the evening?

34:24.168 --> 34:26.849
Call...
You like to watch people die.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.932
Hi, I am Debbie.
Thanks for calling.

34:57.957 --> 35:00.237
Hi Deb. Only me.

35:00.782 --> 35:04.340
Can you call me on the number I have left?
I need to talk to you.

36:16.914 --> 36:18.531
Behave yourself.

36:34.072 --> 36:35.642
Damn.

36:54.132 --> 36:55.292
Hi.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.868
- Hi. - Ed here?

36:57.291 --> 36:59.075
No, it won't be until tomorrow.

37:01.787 --> 37:04.006
I'll fill it. Diesel.

37:05.761 --> 37:08.026
Pump number two?

37:08.342 --> 37:10.037
Yes Madam.

37:11.121 --> 37:12.738
OK.

37:49.761 --> 37:51.737
A bad night to be out.

37:51.897 --> 37:54.194
Let me say that a lot.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.936
I've never seen you here.

37:57.086 --> 37:59.360
This is my first night.

38:00.782 --> 38:02.274
Did you like it?

38:02.553 --> 38:04.350
Yes sure.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.086
So why is this here?
Are you a student or something?

38:07.208 --> 38:08.411
No.

38:10.948 --> 38:13.776
It was time to hire
a beautiful person.

38:15.311 --> 38:18.693
Why a beautiful
woman like you...

38:19.778 --> 38:21.520
... works in such a mess?

38:22.217 --> 38:23.600
I needed work.

38:24.257 --> 38:26.405
Have your boyfriend look at you.

38:26.654 --> 38:28.346
I do not have a boyfriend.

38:31.990 --> 38:34.091
How comes?

38:34.187 --> 38:38.503
Because I tried to kill him.
Got 159.75, please.

38:43.579 --> 38:46.564
Damn.
I think I'm falling in love.

38:47.709 --> 38:50.647
- Is it a debit or credit card?
- Credit.

38:53.774 --> 38:57.008
When you're tired of not
having a man with you

38:57.901 --> 39:00.143
... I don't sleep for 24 hours.

39:01.329 --> 39:04.851
Thanks, but I'm not going
out with anyone for now.

39:09.268 --> 39:11.471
Shame about those machines.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.855
Damn!

39:34.078 --> 39:36.555
You forgot your credit card!

40:08.522 --> 40:11.095
Oh my God!

40:13.187 --> 40:16.832
- What are you doing here?
- I called you, but you didn't hear.

40:16.952 --> 40:18.268
Yes, I have not heard.

40:18.293 --> 40:21.679
- What are you doing outside?
Someone forgot his credit card.

40:22.415 --> 40:24.462
- Damn.
- God, your lip is bleeding.

40:24.487 --> 40:27.434
Yeah what happened, you hit my face.
Sorry.

40:27.725 --> 40:30.100
- Let's go inside. - Yes.

40:34.012 --> 40:36.473
He had a solid right hook.

40:36.766 --> 40:39.977
Sorry,
I thought you were someone else.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.219
I wouldn't want to be that person.

40:42.443 --> 40:43.662
Yes.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.670
You wouldn't want to.

40:47.586 --> 40:49.547
Are you hurt?

40:49.810 --> 40:51.309
No problem.

40:51.785 --> 40:53.176
Sorry.

40:56.298 --> 40:59.283
So what are you doing here?

40:59.602 --> 41:02.727
Ed asked me to come and see you.

41:05.426 --> 41:06.869
How are you?

41:06.894 --> 41:10.923
I had one customer.

41:13.294 --> 41:14.321
Do you know him?

41:14.346 --> 41:17.836
- A big, tall, bald man driving a truck
- Yes, he is.

41:17.907 --> 41:20.741
Yes, he left it here on purpose.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
Why would he do such a thing?

41:23.140 --> 41:28.077
Because Ed slept with this
girl until he hit him.

41:29.978 --> 41:32.908
How can someone sleep with him?

41:33.971 --> 41:35.838
He gave him money.

41:37.088 --> 41:39.510
Disgusting.

41:39.793 --> 41:41.878
They did it in that chair.

41:50.151 --> 41:52.143
How is everything going?

41:56.425 --> 41:57.909
I am fine.

41:58.672 --> 42:00.742
Ed told me he went to jail.

42:02.161 --> 42:03.770
Turn right.

42:03.879 --> 42:06.559
That's why he asked
you to look at me.

42:06.999 --> 42:08.734
To make sure I don't
steal anything.

42:08.759 --> 42:11.780
No, he just wondered
if everything is okay.

42:12.626 --> 42:13.728
Eee?

42:14.337 --> 42:16.892
Looking from here looks good.

42:23.746 --> 42:26.011
Can I ask you a question?

42:28.485 --> 42:29.782
Of course.

42:30.516 --> 42:33.914
Why did you burn your friend?

42:42.633 --> 42:44.821
I think the news spread immediately.

42:51.686 --> 42:53.616
You really want to know?

42:54.546 --> 42:56.468
Do you want to talk?

42:59.541 --> 43:01.401
Not really.

43:02.291 --> 43:03.971
Good.

43:07.911 --> 43:09.958
My boyfriend...

43:11.959 --> 43:14.256
... James Lincoln Fields idi.

43:15.863 --> 43:17.426
Did you fall in the rain?

43:19.608 --> 43:20.788
Yes.

43:21.424 --> 43:24.416
- He killed 30 women. - 35.

43:28.087 --> 43:30.829
So you are also the "audience".

43:31.574 --> 43:32.863
Yes.

43:34.370 --> 43:36.089
The press told me that.

43:38.416 --> 43:41.001
Watched all those
girls get killed?

43:43.052 --> 43:44.700
Not all.

43:45.787 --> 43:47.802
How did he feel?

43:53.273 --> 43:55.281
Like I want to die.

44:00.229 --> 44:02.658
I still want to die every day.

44:03.191 --> 44:05.792
- You don't have to talk about it.
- No problem.

44:09.199 --> 44:11.347
How did you learn?

44:12.675 --> 44:15.234
- Did you...
- Did you kill someone?

44:20.371 --> 44:22.254
Can I take a sip of that?

44:23.785 --> 44:25.074
Thank you.

44:38.129 --> 44:40.575
One night I came home from work.

44:41.274 --> 44:42.766
And...

44:44.374 --> 44:45.945
The house smelled.

44:46.904 --> 44:48.326
So bad.

44:51.689 --> 44:54.650
An animal or a
blocked sewer pipe...

44:55.406 --> 44:58.149
I thought...

45:00.185 --> 45:03.859
I went to the basement and...

45:07.225 --> 45:08.975
... flooded everywhere.

45:14.136 --> 45:16.003
Koku...

45:17.435 --> 45:19.739
... seemed unbearable, so...

45:21.110 --> 45:24.079
... I was about to go
upstairs to call James.

45:25.292 --> 45:26.768
Later...

45:29.301 --> 45:31.219
I saw corpses.

45:34.931 --> 45:36.564
Then I got it.

45:37.156 --> 45:41.750
He buried bodies under our house.

45:43.222 --> 45:45.886
I turned my back to call James.

45:48.702 --> 45:50.702
He was waiting for me.

45:53.502 --> 45:55.584
Have you understood the situation?

46:00.458 --> 46:04.559
I always knew something was going
on, but...

46:07.547 --> 46:09.945
I guess I didn't want to believe it.

46:23.094 --> 46:24.547
What did you do after that?

46:28.789 --> 46:29.907
Nothing.

46:32.367 --> 46:34.758
I remained an audience for what happened.

46:35.992 --> 46:39.696
Why didn't you run away
or go to the police?

46:42.415 --> 46:44.188
He said he would kill me.

46:45.075 --> 46:47.067
And my whole family.

46:49.575 --> 46:52.622
I'm not making excuses for what I
did, but...

46:54.951 --> 46:56.660
I was young.

46:57.419 --> 46:59.299
And I was scared.

47:01.051 --> 47:03.410
I didn't know what else I could do.

47:10.789 --> 47:12.851
Then he showed me.

47:16.214 --> 47:18.230
What happened when you stopped watching?

47:20.057 --> 47:23.393
His name was Christine Rogers.

47:26.472 --> 47:28.269
He was very young.

47:28.871 --> 47:32.355
After that I didn't
want to live anymore.

47:34.132 --> 47:35.608
So...

47:37.285 --> 47:39.068
While he slept...

47:40.882 --> 47:42.865
I set the house on fire.

47:45.726 --> 47:47.452
If you are in it?

47:54.583 --> 47:56.551
Still alive, right?

48:00.179 --> 48:01.921
Why rain?

48:02.913 --> 48:05.662
So that their spirits can be cleaned.

48:15.757 --> 48:17.671
I was very sick.

48:20.530 --> 48:22.936
What's not real...

48:24.184 --> 48:26.064
... I couldn't distinguish.

48:29.072 --> 48:32.791
I saw victims everywhere.

48:35.298 --> 48:37.188
How are you now?

48:41.195 --> 48:43.125
Good day or bad.

48:45.243 --> 48:47.024
But I'm getting better.

48:48.050 --> 48:49.753
It's good to hear that.

48:59.210 --> 49:00.827
This one...

49:01.630 --> 49:04.904
... if you don't tell anyone?

49:05.525 --> 49:08.681
While I'm not saying that,
somehow people are already learning.

49:09.585 --> 49:11.053
Yes.

49:13.451 --> 49:15.061
I have to go.

49:16.434 --> 49:18.606
- OK. - No problems, I hope?

49:19.519 --> 49:21.089
Yes.

49:26.779 --> 49:29.248
Do you have anything
to ask before you go?

49:32.230 --> 49:34.394
Did anyone really eat from that?

49:35.204 --> 49:36.758
Of this?

49:40.388 --> 49:41.826
Let's see.

49:52.963 --> 49:55.081
You don't realize what you are missing.

49:55.106 --> 49:56.932
My God.

49:57.579 --> 49:58.993
So dirty.

50:02.692 --> 50:05.003
Thanks for the pork tongue, Mary.

50:05.196 --> 50:07.540
I'll tell Ed he's okay.

50:08.631 --> 50:11.217
- Thank you. - Goodbye, Mary.

50:11.242 --> 50:13.081
I will see.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.613
Do you have a sink?

50:35.860 --> 50:38.180
Yes, outside.

50:39.274 --> 50:40.500
Come on.

50:50.529 --> 50:51.990
Damn.

50:56.248 --> 50:57.716
Fuck!

51:03.578 --> 51:06.051
- Do you have ID?
- Yes there is.

51:11.617 --> 51:14.094
Thanks, Tom. - No problem.

51:20.327 --> 51:23.468
It costs $ 11.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.807
- Do you understand.
- Thank you.

51:27.519 --> 51:28.738
Please.

51:29.917 --> 51:31.222
Excuse me.

51:33.348 --> 51:35.051
Deer gas station. I am Mary.

51:35.083 --> 51:37.560
♪ kie Rain drops ♪

51:41.053 --> 51:42.392
Are you all right, ma'am?

51:42.417 --> 51:46.556
Let me tell you,
your sink is completely submerged.

51:50.610 --> 51:51.962
Let's go.

52:00.544 --> 52:01.810
Damn!

52:02.719 --> 52:03.922
Fuck!

52:36.235 --> 52:37.513
Awesome.

54:36.506 --> 54:37.904
Help me!

54:46.892 --> 54:49.821
Why don't you help?

54:52.426 --> 54:54.140
This is not real.

54:54.476 --> 54:55.710
You're not real.

54:55.908 --> 54:58.225
You're not real.
You're not real.

54:58.312 --> 55:00.749
You're not real.
You're not real.

55:00.899 --> 55:02.251
You're not real.

56:03.520 --> 56:04.934
What are you looking for here?

56:04.959 --> 56:07.525
I came by, I said,
"How are you?"

56:08.554 --> 56:10.293
It's late to be out, isn't it?

56:10.318 --> 56:12.031
I don't sleep much.

56:12.322 --> 56:15.763
Phones don't work here?
- You don't have to check on me.

56:15.788 --> 56:17.693
I have no control over you.

56:17.980 --> 56:20.332
Ed called me and asked a
few questions about you.

56:20.419 --> 56:21.771
Awesome.

56:22.075 --> 56:23.731
Did you tell him everything?

56:25.147 --> 56:27.499
See, why don't you send me back?

56:27.577 --> 56:29.076
Is that what you want?

56:29.909 --> 56:33.777
For your information, I told him he
was a good person who fell badly.

56:33.901 --> 56:36.416
And now you're trying
to streamline your life.

56:36.876 --> 56:38.095
Thank you.

56:38.223 --> 56:39.621
Are you OK?

56:40.557 --> 56:41.830
I am fine.

56:44.882 --> 56:47.053
I use the sink, where?

56:47.931 --> 56:49.892
Outside is unusable.

56:50.366 --> 56:52.118
You will have to use the back.

56:52.143 --> 56:54.115
The thin key opens the door.

56:55.058 --> 56:56.480
Thank you.

57:11.902 --> 57:13.371
May I help you?

57:26.073 --> 57:27.604
Hi Mary.

57:27.986 --> 57:29.470
You're not real.

57:30.024 --> 57:31.476
You're not real.

57:32.132 --> 57:33.515
You're not real.

57:42.787 --> 57:43.935
I'm real.

57:53.887 --> 57:56.786
I heard they released you,
I said to come and see how you are.

58:00.422 --> 58:02.547
You still think I'm not
real, right?

58:05.535 --> 58:07.926
Still seeing things you
don't want to believe?

58:11.359 --> 58:14.304
You're just like me, Mary.
He liked to see them die.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.468
I am not like you.

58:16.738 --> 58:18.402
You're worse.

58:19.549 --> 58:22.721
You could stop me, but you didn't.

58:23.855 --> 58:25.738
You let people die.

58:26.627 --> 58:28.760
Until the death of innocent people.

58:29.066 --> 58:32.285
- I was sick.
You still believe your own lies.

58:34.416 --> 58:35.744
Still.

58:39.021 --> 58:40.958
This is not happening.

58:43.844 --> 58:46.117
Tonight you will see people die.

58:47.925 --> 58:50.917
And I bet any claim...

58:51.419 --> 58:54.580
... you will like it. Later...

58:56.766 --> 58:58.664
I'll watch you die.

59:01.414 --> 59:03.289
There is nothing
you can do for this.

59:08.835 --> 59:11.264
My parole officer is in the back.

59:11.492 --> 59:13.245
Do you think I'm not aware of this?

59:13.485 --> 59:15.720
I will tell him.

59:19.356 --> 59:20.919
What if I'm not real?

59:24.080 --> 59:26.395
They will lock you up forever, Mary.

59:29.838 --> 59:31.627
I know it's not real.

59:33.119 --> 59:35.204
And I'll prove it to you.

59:49.130 --> 59:51.028
I would buy gas.

59:52.139 --> 59:53.303
Of course.

59:53.451 --> 59:56.334
Can I get $ 10 on pump three?

59:57.045 --> 59:58.373
Good.

01:00:00.499 --> 01:00:02.530
Outside it is raining badly.

01:00:03.661 --> 01:00:04.872
Yes.

01:00:05.955 --> 01:00:08.478
Your money is worth.

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:10.975
Thank you.

01:00:12.286 --> 01:00:13.996
How long are you open until the evening?

01:00:21.121 --> 01:00:23.113
Why do you keep calling me?

01:00:23.383 --> 01:00:24.524
How come?

01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:26.862
You called me before.

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.936
I know it was you.

01:00:30.075 --> 01:00:32.763
- Sorry, do I know you?
- You know me!

01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:35.239
What do you want!

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:37.772
I think you mistook me for someone else, honey.

01:00:37.797 --> 01:00:40.231
Do not lie.
I am aware of everything.

01:00:40.256 --> 01:00:42.524
I'm aware of every shit.

01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:45.724
- What is happening?
This woman called me all night.

01:00:45.749 --> 01:00:47.904
I don't know what he's talking about.

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:50.083
- He's one of them.
- Who is that, Mary?

01:00:51.285 --> 01:00:54.560
Someone keeps calling
and threatening me.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:56.382
Are you sure it's that woman?

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:01.068
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:01:01.093 --> 01:01:03.863
Remember,
I am paranoid and delusional.

01:01:03.888 --> 01:01:06.050
You should have told me.

01:01:07.654 --> 01:01:10.262
See, you have to tell me
everything and be honest with me.

01:01:10.946 --> 01:01:12.985
Only in this way can we get anywhere.

01:01:14.259 --> 01:01:16.556
- You understand? - OK.

01:01:18.895 --> 01:01:20.380
It is late.

01:01:23.807 --> 01:01:25.338
Goodnight.

01:01:27.793 --> 01:01:29.128
Thank you.

01:01:49.879 --> 01:01:51.488
Debbie?

01:02:38.539 --> 01:02:41.966
You like to watch.

01:03:31.866 --> 01:03:34.147
Tom Doogan's phone.
Leave your name and number.

01:03:35.185 --> 01:03:37.545
Tom, you have to call me.

01:03:38.203 --> 01:03:39.742
I think something is wrong.

01:03:40.043 --> 01:03:42.004
Please call me.

01:03:52.847 --> 01:03:54.518
911.

01:03:58.396 --> 01:04:00.130
Mary, nothing.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.106
Everything is alright.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.858
There is nothing.

01:04:11.077 --> 01:04:14.157
Hey?
- This is an emergency center.

01:04:14.337 --> 01:04:16.251
We have received a call from this number.

01:04:16.325 --> 01:04:19.645
Sorry I thought I turned
it off before connecting.

01:04:20.049 --> 01:04:21.438
Do you have an emergency?

01:04:21.463 --> 01:04:24.486
No, I didn't want to call.
Sorry.

01:05:12.071 --> 01:05:14.461
- If you want to call...
- Shit!

01:07:04.869 --> 01:07:06.666
You're not real.

01:07:07.088 --> 01:07:08.706
You're not real.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.419
Help out.

01:07:34.659 --> 01:07:38.163
- Please help. - Take it easy.

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:40.477
We have to call the police.

01:07:41.211 --> 01:07:42.812
It will kill me.

01:07:42.885 --> 01:07:46.609
- Everything is alright.
- No, you don't understand.

01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:49.803
Fuck!  The phone still does not work.

01:07:57.767 --> 01:07:59.642
Do you remember him?

01:08:08.024 --> 01:08:10.780
He was only 18 years old.

01:08:11.618 --> 01:08:13.986
The university was in the first grade.

01:08:16.231 --> 01:08:18.283
He was going to be a doctor.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:24.752
But you and that beast
got all of this from him.

01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:27.129
I did not do.

01:08:27.331 --> 01:08:31.665
You watched her
kill my daughter.

01:08:44.707 --> 01:08:46.846
When I heard they are releasing you...

01:08:46.904 --> 01:08:49.225
I had to come and do something.

01:10:56.769 --> 01:10:58.621
No!  No!

01:11:05.345 --> 01:11:07.415
- Are you OK? - Yes.

01:11:07.621 --> 01:11:08.699
Damn.

01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:21.215
- Is he dead? - Yes.

01:11:22.067 --> 01:11:24.153
I tried to call you but the
phones are disconnected.

01:11:24.328 --> 01:11:25.820
I know.

01:11:26.872 --> 01:11:29.419
She said I killed her daughter.

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:32.131
His name is Carol Rogers.

01:11:32.834 --> 01:11:34.841
Her daughter's name was Christine.

01:11:35.075 --> 01:11:36.263
No.

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:44.834
Will no one forgive me?

01:11:45.236 --> 01:11:46.369
No.

01:11:52.306 --> 01:11:53.306
Fuck.

01:11:53.331 --> 01:11:54.653
What?

01:11:55.463 --> 01:11:57.057
We have to reach the police.

01:11:58.337 --> 01:11:59.946
Why did you come back?

01:12:01.267 --> 01:12:03.702
- I have to tell you something.
What?

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:06.969
Come on, let's go.
- No, tell me what happened.

01:12:07.373 --> 01:12:09.224
There was an accident in prison.

01:12:09.651 --> 01:12:11.081
What kind of accident?

01:12:11.188 --> 01:12:13.321
A big storm cut the electricity.

01:12:13.859 --> 01:12:15.820
Some prisoners have fled.

01:12:16.244 --> 01:12:18.283
James is one of those escapees.

01:12:20.397 --> 01:12:21.858
Was that real?

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.823
They didn't want me to tell you because
they didn't think you could chase it.

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:27.777
He was here.

01:12:28.703 --> 01:12:29.820
Born?

01:12:32.194 --> 01:12:33.553
No!

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:42.665
No.  To make.

01:13:10.561 --> 01:13:12.949
No!  No!

01:13:13.028 --> 01:13:14.598
No!

01:13:15.021 --> 01:13:16.701
No!

01:13:19.588 --> 01:13:22.346
No!  No!

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:24.818
No!

01:13:58.577 --> 01:14:00.788
I told you I was real.

01:14:03.016 --> 01:14:05.837
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Are you OK?

01:14:11.188 --> 01:14:13.164
I was watching you.

01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:21.965
I really thought that woman
was going to kill you.

01:14:32.019 --> 01:14:34.176
But Tom did me a favor.

01:14:34.409 --> 01:14:36.823
He killed him so that I
wouldn't have to kill him.

01:14:37.908 --> 01:14:39.759
Now we are together again.

01:14:43.244 --> 01:14:44.892
Just like before.

01:14:46.922 --> 01:14:48.554
What are you going to do?

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:50.925
You know what to do.

01:14:51.433 --> 01:14:52.753
No.

01:14:53.292 --> 01:14:54.643
Please don't.

01:15:06.161 --> 01:15:08.317
You don't have to do this.

01:15:08.997 --> 01:15:10.421
Yes, it is necessary.

01:15:32.148 --> 01:15:33.858
I trusted you.

01:15:35.567 --> 01:15:37.653
You did these to me in return.

01:15:37.811 --> 01:15:40.038
I am no longer afraid of you.

01:15:40.333 --> 01:15:41.872
You should be.

01:15:43.028 --> 01:15:44.847
No.

01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:53.953
Watch me, Mary.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.009
- No. - Watch!

01:16:24.255 --> 01:16:27.099
- Watch me, Mary. - No.

01:16:27.284 --> 01:16:28.527
No.

01:16:28.946 --> 01:16:30.126
No.

01:16:51.047 --> 01:16:54.392
No thanks. Please don't. Please.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.077
Please.

01:16:57.370 --> 01:17:00.383
- Please stop.
- Tell me you Love Me.

01:17:00.904 --> 01:17:02.239
No.

01:17:03.235 --> 01:17:05.406
Tell me you love me
and he won't die.

01:17:12.126 --> 01:17:13.649
I love you.

01:17:13.953 --> 01:17:15.445
I love you too.

01:17:27.615 --> 01:17:29.277
I love you very much.

01:17:31.579 --> 01:17:34.537
I'm doing all this for
you, you know?

01:18:24.571 --> 01:18:26.618
You like to watch, right?

01:18:31.524 --> 01:18:32.749
Said.

01:18:34.578 --> 01:18:35.922
No.

01:18:38.805 --> 01:18:40.972
You disappoint me, Mary.

01:18:47.133 --> 01:18:49.711
You like to watch people
burn, right?

01:18:50.849 --> 01:18:52.552
Fuck.

01:19:18.617 --> 01:19:20.832
We will be together again soon.

01:19:20.897 --> 01:19:24.459
I'll never be with you.

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:30.818
Help out!

01:19:30.886 --> 01:19:32.784
Help out!

01:20:24.178 --> 01:20:25.592
Let's.

01:20:28.398 --> 01:20:30.624
Ed has a gun in his closet.
What?

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.395
In your closet.
Number 37. Right there.

01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:35.606
Get it, get it before it comes back.

01:20:36.668 --> 01:20:38.801
- With a lock on it. - OK.

01:20:39.493 --> 01:20:41.910
- Do you have the key?
- No. - Shit.

01:20:43.818 --> 01:20:46.357
Mary, Mary.
There is a pipe there.

01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:48.471
There is a pipe there.

01:20:56.808 --> 01:20:58.293
Hi?

01:21:21.949 --> 01:21:24.534
Hi sweety. Are you here?

01:21:25.307 --> 01:21:27.247
You have my credit card.

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:30.285
See that little
button on the gun?

01:21:30.684 --> 01:21:32.308
From there the gun will open.

01:21:34.674 --> 01:21:36.369
Insert two cartridges.

01:21:37.986 --> 01:21:39.212
Well done to my daughter.

01:21:40.757 --> 01:21:41.850
Die et.

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:45.053
Die et. That.

01:22:10.764 --> 01:22:12.162
Damn.

01:22:13.701 --> 01:22:15.248
Damn.

01:22:17.089 --> 01:22:19.233
Untie my hands, untie my hands.

01:22:20.626 --> 01:22:21.860
To go.

01:22:24.413 --> 01:22:26.458
Come on come on.

01:22:32.065 --> 01:22:34.347
911, report your emergency.

01:22:34.404 --> 01:22:37.015
I'm at the Deer gas
station on Hwy 6.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.264
I think someone may have robbed this place.

01:22:39.948 --> 01:22:41.995
You better send a vehicle.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.848
Sir, please stay in your car
until the authorities arrive.

01:22:46.515 --> 01:22:47.913
Okay.

01:23:09.887 --> 01:23:12.897
Point the gun at the door.

01:23:13.187 --> 01:23:15.434
Pull the trigger as soon as you enter.

01:23:16.899 --> 01:23:18.453
I'm not going to die here.

01:23:18.828 --> 01:23:20.836
I'm not going to die here.

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:28.429
I have to pick you up at six.

01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:38.730
Hold the gun like that.

01:23:41.592 --> 01:23:43.452
As soon as he comes in...

01:23:43.926 --> 01:23:45.332
... download it.

01:24:07.674 --> 01:24:08.947
Damn.

01:24:09.162 --> 01:24:11.210
- Hold it up to the door. - OK.

01:24:39.244 --> 01:24:41.197
Come on, motherfucker.

01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:04.388
- I shot him. - Let's.

01:25:17.382 --> 01:25:18.710
No.

01:25:26.174 --> 01:25:27.681
It wasn't.

01:25:28.633 --> 01:25:30.375
I shot someone.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:33.448
It's not your fault.

01:25:36.693 --> 01:25:38.092
You didn't know.

01:25:38.126 --> 01:25:40.337
I did it, I pulled the trigger.

01:25:40.765 --> 01:25:42.610
Give me the gun.

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.941
Firework.  Let's.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:51.723
It's always my fault.

01:26:05.336 --> 01:26:09.092
When he comes in the
door, I blow his head.

01:26:09.632 --> 01:26:12.695
No, we cannot stay here.

01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:15.026
We are dead.

01:26:15.144 --> 01:26:16.566
Let's.

01:26:37.951 --> 01:26:39.966
Stay near me.

01:26:41.281 --> 01:26:45.250
- How many bullets do we have?
- Two.

01:26:45.808 --> 01:26:47.898
Okay okay.

01:27:06.499 --> 01:27:08.452
- The police are here. - Yes.

01:27:08.538 --> 01:27:10.819
Okay, let's go.

01:27:28.154 --> 01:27:29.862
Fuck.

01:27:41.733 --> 01:27:46.361
I'm Officer Collins.
Coal Bank road, I'm at Deer gas station.

01:27:46.508 --> 01:27:49.055
I answer the call.

01:27:49.769 --> 01:27:51.870
I'll take a look.

01:27:57.304 --> 01:28:00.244
- Squat on the floor.
Place. Please. Help out.

01:28:00.269 --> 01:28:01.760
- Please help me.
- Take it easy.

01:28:01.785 --> 01:28:03.230
Is anyone else in there?

01:28:03.635 --> 01:28:06.657
Yes. Coming up,
we have to go right away.

01:28:06.682 --> 01:28:07.853
Stand up.

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:09.553
Slowly.

01:28:10.187 --> 01:28:12.007
Tell me what's going on.

01:28:12.282 --> 01:28:13.595
He's in the store.

01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.336
Who's in the store?

01:28:15.542 --> 01:28:17.253
James Lincoln Fields.

01:28:17.497 --> 01:28:19.317
It's after me.

01:28:19.482 --> 01:28:21.372
Get in the car, get in the car.

01:28:33.587 --> 01:28:35.071
I'm Officer Collins...

01:28:35.096 --> 01:28:36.378
No!  No!

01:29:23.952 --> 01:29:29.616
Translation: aytug2001

01:29:37.437 --> 01:29:39.031
Hi?

01:29:57.832 --> 01:29:59.559
Hi?

01:32:34.857 --> 01:32:36.690
Stop!  Stop!

01:32:37.847 --> 01:32:39.674
Please stop! Stop!

01:33:34.936 --> 01:33:36.545
Maria!

01:33:41.856 --> 01:33:43.016
Fuck!

01:34:09.522 --> 01:34:11.272
Stay with me.

01:34:23.093 --> 01:34:25.671
I'm not going anywhere without
you, Mary.

01:34:34.952 --> 01:34:37.024
It's time to go, honey.

01:36:31.314 --> 01:36:33.759
911, report your emergency.

01:36:44.894 --> 01:36:46.363
I love you.
