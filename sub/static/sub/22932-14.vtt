[metal and wood creaking]

11:09.710 --> 11:11.080
Here I come.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.330
-[boy] Harley!
-[all gasp]

11:19.290 --> 11:21.670
Forgot to calculate
I weigh more than a watermelon.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.460
At least I'm not
covered in anything.

11:24.460 --> 11:27.120
I'm calling this one
a draw.

11:30.330 --> 11:33.580
Come on, Harley.
This is overkill, even for you.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.210
I didn't do this.

11:36.670 --> 11:39.120
[electronic voice]
This is our game now.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.790
[all grunting]

11:45.790 --> 11:48.460
[electronic voice]
Pushing will get you nowhere.

11:48.460 --> 11:52.620
You better let us out.
My dad is a ninja.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.420
[Tom over radio]
This is your dad.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.920
I'm not a ninja.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.830
Although I have been hitting
the bench press lately.

11:57.830 --> 11:59.620
-Thank you for noticing.
-Dad, we already failed

11:59.620 --> 12:01.620
at one escape room today.

12:01.620 --> 12:05.120
That's because the first
was missing one key player.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.420
You guys looked at Harley,
right?

12:08.420 --> 12:11.210
You can't bond
as a family

12:11.210 --> 12:13.620
without everyone
working together.

12:13.620 --> 12:16.210
So solve your way
out of this escape room,

12:16.210 --> 12:17.920
then come find us.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.880
We're hiding somewhere
in the house.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.000
Just make sure you get
to us before time runs out.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.290
And if you don't,

12:24.290 --> 12:26.920
we're going to the real
Pilgrimland,

12:26.920 --> 12:29.000
which Dad and I love.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.080
And if you all hate it,
well, you can bond over that.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.420
Guys, look.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.790
[beeping]

12:36.120 --> 12:37.880
I was going to sit back
and let you guys suffer,

12:37.880 --> 12:40.120
but I spent a day
and a half

12:40.120 --> 12:41.790
setting up
attic Pilgrimland.

12:41.790 --> 12:43.460
There's no way I'm going
to the real one.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.460
[Georgie]
You heard her, people.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.620
Focus up.
We've got codes to crack.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.460
Read your first clue,

12:50.460 --> 12:53.210
then find the letters
that spell "Diaz."

12:53.210 --> 12:55.880
And soon enough,
you will be free-az.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.120
Don't improvise, Suz.

13:03.830 --> 13:05.880
Guys, guys, a clue.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.290
"Captaining this ship
will take all your might,

13:10.290 --> 13:13.080
but when you work together
you're usually right."

13:13.080 --> 13:15.080
Okay, so let's break
this thing down.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.250
Ships often symbolize, like--

13:18.250 --> 13:20.290
Captain's wheel on the wall!
Spin it to the right!

13:20.290 --> 13:21.540
I'm sorry.

13:21.540 --> 13:22.880
I know we're working
together.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.920
I just definitely
knew that one.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.080
Somebody else
want to spin it?

13:31.290 --> 13:32.290
[all gasp]

13:34.210 --> 13:35.920
[Lewie]
Come on, come on.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.580
[jingle chimes]

13:39.540 --> 13:41.580
-[gasps]
-Wow.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.330
I didn't think Mom and Dad
were paying attention

13:43.330 --> 13:44.880
when I gave that lesson
on circuits.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.420
Okay, there's three rooms
to search,

13:46.420 --> 13:48.040
and time is running out.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.000
We have to split up.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.540
How should we pair?
The usual?

13:52.540 --> 13:53.790
Oh, yeah?

13:53.790 --> 13:57.210
Well, this is my
slushie-pouring pose.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.250
Oh, yeah!

14:02.250 --> 14:04.000
[laughs]

14:05.250 --> 14:07.620
-Ow!
-It's tangled. Hold on.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.540
[gasps]
Oh, no! It's ruined!

14:12.540 --> 14:14.540
[voice on speakers]

14:14.540 --> 14:15.830
Hey, stop it!

14:15.830 --> 14:17.620
No, get off me, Harley.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.330
Yeah, we better
shake things up.

14:20.330 --> 14:21.210
Yeah.

14:21.210 --> 14:23.290
-Uh, Beast. Yeah.
-Yeah?

14:23.290 --> 14:25.250
-Okay, let's go.
-[all chattering]

14:25.250 --> 14:27.540
-Bathroom, let's go.
-Let's go, let's go.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.080
Look at us.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.540
Combining teaching lessons

14:31.540 --> 14:32.920
with alone time
from the kids.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.330
You know, it may have
taken us 18 years,

14:34.330 --> 14:36.250
but we've finally
reached peak parenting.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, a lot
of trial and error.

14:45.670 --> 14:47.330
Oh!

14:47.330 --> 14:48.580
Yeah!

14:48.580 --> 14:49.920
[Suzy]
They're just foam pucks.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.380
-Whoo!
-[Suzy] No big deal.

14:51.380 --> 14:52.380
Oh!

14:55.620 --> 14:58.580
I'm getting some calls
from the neighborhood moms.

14:58.580 --> 15:01.330
A lot of them using the words
"excessive force."

15:01.330 --> 15:03.210
Not groovy.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.380
Ridiculous.

15:08.380 --> 15:09.420
[farting sound]

15:09.420 --> 15:11.210
-Cyclone Suzy!
-Cyclone Suzy!

15:13.250 --> 15:14.670
[screams]

15:23.250 --> 15:25.250
[sighs]

15:27.290 --> 15:28.750
Mostly error.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.790
Hey, come on.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.000
"A big family is all about
chemistry."

15:39.000 --> 15:41.330
We get to blow stuff up?

15:41.330 --> 15:45.210
Easy. You're awesome at
destroying stuff with science.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.620
We don't have
to blow anything up.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.000
These are all elements
on the periodic table.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I bet the reaction
when you combine them--

16:00.000 --> 16:02.790
So we are
blowing something up?

16:02.790 --> 16:04.500
[imitates explosion]

16:06.420 --> 16:08.880
Ooh, this must lead us
to the combination.

16:12.380 --> 16:16.460
"If you want to advance,
act like the Diaz in France."

16:18.540 --> 16:20.920
Rachel! Three-minute limit.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.120
You've been in there
for 20.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.620
No, Rachel, I need you
to find Harley.

16:24.620 --> 16:25.880
She has a call.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.420
From who? 1998?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.920
Who even uses
a landline anymore?

16:29.920 --> 16:31.330
[sighs]

16:31.330 --> 16:33.540
Rachel, I'm busy
with laundry.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.580
Find Harley.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.750
Hey, Ethan.
Phone's for Harley.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.380
I can't find her.
I've looked everywhere.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.330
Did you try her room?

16:41.330 --> 16:43.290
Let's not do this.
We both know I didn't.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.750
Not sure why
I still miss her.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.790
Okay, let's think
like Rachel.

16:52.330 --> 16:54.170
Start with taking
all the hot water.

16:54.170 --> 16:55.420
Yeah.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.290
Oh.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.790
"If you want to complete
your mission,

17:02.790 --> 17:05.790
you must find
this family tradition."

17:05.790 --> 17:07.500
Oh, no, we have a lot
of those.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.250
The birthday box.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.540
Happy first birthday,
Rachel.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.500
We love you.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.420
Happy birthday,
Georgie Porgie.

17:17.420 --> 17:19.080
-Hey, do we have a boy crown?
-[babies crying]

17:19.080 --> 17:20.420
[Suzy]
Just put it on him!

17:20.420 --> 17:21.960
I'm changing
two diapers here.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.540
Here you go, Ethan.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.420
Secret scarer.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.750
Beast, hands off
my guitar.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.710
Aah!

17:34.710 --> 17:36.750
[cackling]

17:36.750 --> 17:39.000
[Beast]
Merry Scary!

17:40.920 --> 17:42.500
This would be a lot easier

17:42.500 --> 17:44.500
if you guys had a tradition
of cleaning your room.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.500
Yes, we should have
straightened up

17:46.500 --> 17:48.620
on the off-chance
an elaborate escape game

17:48.620 --> 17:51.330
requiring a clean room would
be the one thing between us

17:51.330 --> 17:52.580
and Pilgrimland.

17:52.580 --> 17:53.880
[Tom]
Tick-tock.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.290
You better look
at the clock.

17:55.290 --> 17:56.580
Time's running out,

17:56.580 --> 17:58.670
and Pilgrimland's
your next stop.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.250
What are we wasting time for?

18:02.250 --> 18:04.120
We're minutes away from
bonnets and buckled shoes.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.170
Go, go, go!

18:06.170 --> 18:08.000
Hurry, come on.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.380
[timer beeping]

18:12.960 --> 18:15.540
I know this clue has something
to do with chemistry.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.620
Oxygen and hydrogen are gasses.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.460
It says "behind books."

18:36.080 --> 18:37.460
How did you--?

18:37.460 --> 18:38.500
I'm good at word jumbles.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.420
Don't worry,
Lewie's bad at them too.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.540
You guys are
over-thinkers.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.920
And underestimaters.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.380
Nice going.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.620
Now can I blow
something up?

18:49.620 --> 18:50.960
Come on.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.170
Let's put this "I"
up on the board.

18:53.170 --> 18:55.620
I'm not sure that this
is how Rachel does it,

18:55.620 --> 18:57.540
but she should.

18:57.540 --> 18:59.670
I'm starting to get
pretty good.

18:59.670 --> 19:01.670
Okay, makeover's done.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.460
Good luck at your sister's
wedding.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.170
What?

19:06.170 --> 19:08.540
I look terrible!

19:08.540 --> 19:10.210
I know you're only
doing this

19:10.210 --> 19:11.500
because we're trying
to solve a clue,

19:11.500 --> 19:13.790
but can you do it again
on Deathne's birthday?

19:13.790 --> 19:16.580
I hear Blue Fairy's
bringing it.

19:16.580 --> 19:19.170
Of course.
Blue Fairy's the worst.

19:19.170 --> 19:21.540
6896!

19:21.540 --> 19:23.750
Yeah, 6896.

19:23.750 --> 19:27.290
Is that fairy for a word
you're not allowed to say?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.210
The lock combination.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.380
None of this looks like
a family tradition.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.460
Are we sure we read
that clue right?

19:51.460 --> 19:54.460
I think we both know there's
one place we haven't looked.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.540
Oh, no.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.540
I've heard about
what's under that bed.

20:00.710 --> 20:02.000
[sighs]

20:02.000 --> 20:03.750
Go.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.460
Five, four,

20:06.460 --> 20:09.540
three, two...

20:09.540 --> 20:11.540
and you made it.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.710
I am not reaching
under there.

20:18.710 --> 20:20.920
I can only handle one
"Merry Scary" a year.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.920
I always hope
Beast picks me.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.000
He is so bad
at secret scarer.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.330
Yeah, the year he had me,
before the scare he yelled,

20:27.330 --> 20:28.580
"Here I come."

20:28.580 --> 20:30.500
Actually, I told him
to do that.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.920
I know you don't
like scares.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.750
Really?

20:33.750 --> 20:35.790
Well, consider this
repayment.

20:37.710 --> 20:39.580
[groans]

20:43.830 --> 20:45.580
Ooh.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.120
[sighs]

20:49.120 --> 20:50.960
[whimpers]

20:50.960 --> 20:52.710
[gasps]
Whoa!

20:52.710 --> 20:55.540
A Diaz Award.
That's our family tradition.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.620
She's wearing Daphne Diaz.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.040
I designed it myself.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.710
Who are you wearing
tonight?

21:03.710 --> 21:05.210
Ethan Diaz.

21:05.210 --> 21:07.790
From my finest Easter suit
hand-me-down collection.

21:07.790 --> 21:09.290
No tie.

21:09.290 --> 21:10.750
Thought I'd keep it
casual.

21:10.750 --> 21:14.120
I thought I'd keep it
more casual.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.580
Oh, but where's the letter?

21:17.880 --> 21:19.620
[whimpers]

21:20.750 --> 21:22.250
-[gasps] Yes!
-Yes!

21:22.250 --> 21:24.330
High five. Okay.

21:24.330 --> 21:26.710
We got it! We got it!

21:26.710 --> 21:28.380
[overlapped chatter]

21:28.380 --> 21:29.620
Shh, shh, shh.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.830
[jingle chimes]

21:31.830 --> 21:33.460
[all cheer]

21:33.460 --> 21:35.750
[Tom]  Great job, but only
15 seconds left to find us.

21:35.750 --> 21:36.960
We got to go.
Go, go, go, go.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.540
[all shouting]

21:40.710 --> 21:42.960
They might have gotten past the
wall, but they'll never find us.

21:42.960 --> 21:47.120
Good, because I hear this season
Pilgrimland has goose chops.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.750
[kids laugh]

21:48.750 --> 21:51.710
How'd you find
our hiding spot so fast?

21:51.710 --> 21:54.040
It's the number-one hiding spot
in the house.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.000
In other words, the worst
hiding spot in the house.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.790
Well, from one game master
to another,

21:59.790 --> 22:01.790
I'm a big fan
of your work.

22:01.790 --> 22:03.500
Oh, well, good job
solving it.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.290
I guess the pilgrims will have
to do without the Diazes

22:06.290 --> 22:08.000
setting them back
another hundred years.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.290
[all cheer]

22:10.290 --> 22:13.620
Yeah, you're free to go do all
those things you had planned.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.120
This is going to be yummy.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.960
Not quite as yummy
as some goose chops, but...

22:21.960 --> 22:24.380
[all chattering]

22:24.380 --> 22:26.790
[Harley narrating]
Sometimes my family
doesn't work together

22:26.790 --> 22:28.670
when I want them to.

22:28.670 --> 22:31.790
But they always come through
when I need them to.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.670
[yelling]

22:36.380 --> 22:38.170
[all cheering]

22:44.380 --> 22:46.380
[all cheer]

22:50.580 --> 22:53.000
Diaz how we do it!

22:53.000 --> 22:55.540
And who'd want
to escape from that?
