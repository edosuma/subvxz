00:08.007 --> 00:09.533
<i>Have you been told?</i>

00:09.810 --> 00:13.872
<i>Did you ever hear of the curious,
furious, fidgety year...</i>

00:14.114 --> 00:18.745
<i>...when Santa Claus unhitched his sleigh
and vowed he was taking a holiday?</i>

00:19.620 --> 00:23.784
How do I know so much about Santa?
Well, I'm Mrs. Claus.

00:25.158 --> 00:27.718
It was long ago before you were living.

00:28.695 --> 00:33.599
Not yet Christmas, but past Thanksgiving,
though I can't give you the very date.

00:36.537 --> 00:41.202
<i>Santa got up that morning late,
pulled on one boot, and then, its twin...</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:43.510
<i>...ruffled the whiskers on his chin...</i>

00:43.577 --> 00:45.909
...and sat back down
on the side of the bed.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.581
Great North Star, but I'm tired.

00:48.982 --> 00:49.881
...he said.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.978
Painting wagons red and bright,
sharpening ice skates half the night...

00:54.621 --> 00:57.488
...wrapping presents in ribbons and gauze...

00:58.191 --> 00:59.681
...has worn me weary.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.494
...said Santa Claus.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.887
Crick in my back.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.562
Cold in my nose.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.896
Aches in my fingers and all ten toes...

01:09.603 --> 01:13.471
...and a sort of kind of kink inside
whenever I think of...

01:14.341 --> 01:16.002
...that Christmas ride.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.705
Now, Santa, you just rest yourself
a bit longer.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.644
I've already sent for the doctor.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.116
We'll have you back on your feet
in no time.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.452
No wonder you got the shivers and shakes.

01:31.825 --> 01:35.784
Probably, never got over the case of
near-pneumonia you picked up last year...

01:35.862 --> 01:38.729
...gallivanting around the world
in your open sleigh.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.125
And for what?

01:40.334 --> 01:45.135
Just to deliver presents to a bunch of folks
who don't give a hoot in the first place.

01:45.372 --> 01:46.237
But...

01:47.908 --> 01:51.708
Now, now, Doctor.
It's not just presents, and you know it.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.941
What about all that Christmas spirit
and goodwill?

01:55.182 --> 01:57.844
If you had any sense,
you'd give it up as a bad job...

01:57.918 --> 01:59.784
...and stay home in bed this year.

01:59.853 --> 02:03.847
Come now. If Santa stayed home,
there'd be no Christmas.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.689
Who cares?
Nobody cares about Christmas anymore.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.189
They don't?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.292
Of course not.

02:12.733 --> 02:16.431
Wouldn't surprise me none
if nobody even believes in you anymore.

02:16.503 --> 02:18.733
Now, Santa, don't you pay him any mind.

02:18.872 --> 02:22.274
Nobody cares a hooting holler for you
or Christmas.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.474
By the way, Merry Christmas to you.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.216
Now, Santa, I hope you're not going
to take any of that to heart.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.684
No, Ma. The man's right.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.781
I had that same feeling myself,
but I just wouldn't admit it.

02:37.624 --> 02:40.559
Nobody really cares anymore.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.986
And besides, the doctor says...

02:43.063 --> 02:45.191
...I'm really not up to snuff.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.396
Besides, I'm due for a holiday.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.172
I better call the boys...

02:53.040 --> 02:55.634
...and tell them to cancel Christmas.

02:59.646 --> 03:05.710
<i>Warn the people. Tell the papers
I'm much too tired for Christmas capers.</i>

03:07.254 --> 03:09.120
But Santa, you must be kidding.

03:09.456 --> 03:10.582
But, it was true.

03:10.857 --> 03:14.293
Santa was taking a holiday
and the world would soon know...

03:14.361 --> 03:18.264
...that it was to be the year
without a Santa Claus.

03:18.832 --> 03:23.326
"Did you ever hear
of that terrible year

03:23.804 --> 03:26.466
"Way back before you were born

03:28.341 --> 03:32.903
"When Santa Claus took a holiday

03:32.979 --> 03:36.779
"On the night before Christmas morn?"

03:39.453 --> 03:44.186
<i>"It was a year without a Santa Claus</i>

03:44.391 --> 03:47.622
<i>"A Christmas year so sad</i>

03:48.095 --> 03:52.328
<i>"It was a year without a Santa Claus</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:56.002
<i>"The worst we've ever had</i>

03:56.570 --> 04:00.404
<i>"Santa woke up one day
looking tuckered and gray</i>

04:00.874 --> 04:03.639
<i>"And this is what he said:</i>

04:04.644 --> 04:08.512
"'I could sure use some rest
I'm not feeling my best'

04:08.782 --> 04:11.513
<i>"And he yawned as he took to his bed</i>

04:12.552 --> 04:16.785
<i>"There'll" be a year without a Santa Claus</i>

04:17.124 --> 04:20.423
"I'm sure they won't miss me

04:20.827 --> 04:25.230
<i>"There'll" be a year without a Santa Claus</i>

04:25.298 --> 04:28.632
<i>"Beside your Christmas tree</i>

04:29.169 --> 04:33.265
<i>"And he dept through the day
as the hours ticked away</i>

04:33.373 --> 04:36.673
<i>"And the time was growing</i> near

04:37.544 --> 04:39.478
<i>"And the children, they cried</i>

04:39.546 --> 04:41.571
<i>"They thought Santa had died</i>

04:41.815 --> 04:45.149
<i>"Every eye shed a blue Christmas tear</i>

04:45.786 --> 04:50.656
<i>"It was a year without a Santa Claus</i>

04:51.024 --> 04:54.358
<i>"A Christmas year so sad</i>

04:54.528 --> 04:58.829
<i>"It was a year without a Santa Claus</i>

04:59.132 --> 05:03.626
<i>"The worst we've ever had"</i>

05:10.811 --> 05:14.145
<i>But can you imagine, more or less,
what happened...</i>

05:14.414 --> 05:16.348
<i>...when that news reached the press?</i>

05:16.783 --> 05:19.616
<i>Headlines screamed, wires were humming.</i>

05:19.820 --> 05:23.415
<i>"Santa says, 'Too tired, not coming.â€œ</i>

05:24.825 --> 05:30.025
<i>Out in the stable nuzzling hay,
the reindeer dreamed of Christmas day.</i>

05:30.530 --> 05:33.329
<i>But Santa phoned the reindeer groom.</i>

05:34.334 --> 05:37.861
<i>Hang up the harness in the big storeroom.</i>

05:38.071 --> 05:40.802
He called to his elves
and he told each gnome:

05:40.907 --> 05:44.741
Cover up the shelves. We're...

05:45.979 --> 05:47.242
<i>...staying home.</i>

05:47.514 --> 05:49.608
What? Cover the shelves?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.815
<i>...cried the gnomes and elves.</i>

05:52.552 --> 05:53.747
Cover the dolls?

05:53.820 --> 05:55.083
And electric trains?

05:55.222 --> 05:57.816
And the rocking horses
with shaggy manes?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.925
And the rubber boots
for splashing in parks?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.495
And the cowboy suits?

06:02.829 --> 06:04.319
And the Noah's Arks?

06:05.332 --> 06:06.822
And the Noah's Arks.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.093
And the animals too.

06:12.172 --> 06:12.900
Hello?

06:12.973 --> 06:16.068
Jingle Bells. Number One Elf speaking.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.104
And Jangle Bells.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.174
Will you stop that?

06:20.580 --> 06:22.571
May I ask who is calling, please?

06:23.350 --> 06:26.877
Hi, Mrs. Claus! Yes, Mrs. Claus.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.688
Okay, Mrs. Claus.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.986
Sure thing, Mrs. Claus.
Right away, Mrs. Claus.

06:32.592 --> 06:33.821
Who was that?

06:33.894 --> 06:34.918
That was...

06:35.295 --> 06:36.592
Come on.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.434
It fits. It fits very nicely.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.631
I bet I could be Santa Claus.

06:47.941 --> 06:52.003
"Who would know the difference
if Santa Claus was me

06:52.979 --> 06:55.209
"Yes, who would know the difference

06:55.415 --> 06:58.680
"Just Santa Claus and me

07:03.356 --> 07:06.519
"Anyone can be Santa

07:07.027 --> 07:09.962
"Why can't a lady like me

07:10.664 --> 07:14.601
"I admit, I'm underfed
but with a pillow from the bed

07:14.901 --> 07:17.131
"I could be Santa Claus

07:18.638 --> 07:22.074
"Anyone can play Santa

07:22.475 --> 07:25.172
"I fantasized it a lot

07:26.079 --> 07:30.016
"With this hat upon my head
and his suit of Christmas red

07:30.350 --> 07:33.376
"I could be Santa Claus

07:33.787 --> 07:37.314
"And with his, 'ho, ho, ho' I'd be going

07:37.958 --> 07:40.518
"Down the chimneys with his sack

07:41.962 --> 07:45.489
"And although my curls may be showing

07:45.932 --> 07:49.061
"I'll make sure they only see me
from the back

07:49.903 --> 07:53.498
"Yes, anyone can be Santa

07:53.873 --> 07:57.332
"A tantalizing remark

07:57.877 --> 08:01.905
"Though his boots are not my size
with a twinkle in my eyes

08:02.282 --> 08:05.047
"I could be Santa Claus

08:13.927 --> 08:17.522
"With his reindeer and his sleigh
I'd be up, up and away

08:17.664 --> 08:20.292
"Yes, I could be Santa

08:20.400 --> 08:22.266
"I could be Santa

08:22.469 --> 08:26.804
"I could be Santa Claus"

08:30.343 --> 08:31.902
Santa, you changed your mind.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.946
Oh, joy! Oh, happy day!

08:36.349 --> 08:38.215
Well, boys, what do you think?

08:38.585 --> 08:39.881
Hi, Mrs. C.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.852
Mrs. C!

08:43.123 --> 08:44.522
No good, huh?

08:44.724 --> 08:47.625
I guess we'll have to move
right on then to plan B.

08:47.827 --> 08:48.760
Plan B?

08:48.828 --> 08:49.761
What's that?

08:50.330 --> 08:54.164
As I see it, Santa doesn't want to go
because nobody cares, right?

08:54.234 --> 08:54.962
Right.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.562
He thinks there's no Christmas spirit,
no goodwill. Right?

08:58.838 --> 08:59.634
Right.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.836
So, all you have to do is go down there
and find some example...

09:03.910 --> 09:06.538
...of Christmas spirit left over
from last year.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.274
Scout up some goodwill
and show him some proof...

09:10.350 --> 09:12.614
...that somebody cares. Right?

09:12.819 --> 09:13.650
Right.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.788
Santa will change his mind,
and presto, Christmas is on again.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.785
Now, make sure you don't get lost.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.860
- Lost?
- Lost?

09:25.298 --> 09:27.630
Vixen's made the trip. Haven't you, dear?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.936
- She'll take you. No problem.
- Yeah, but...

09:31.337 --> 09:35.103
Just hurry along and gather up
enough proof to change Santa's mind...

09:35.208 --> 09:37.677
...and we can get on
with Christmas as usual.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.781
Bon voyage. Send us a card now and then.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.317
I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing.

09:49.389 --> 09:52.620
But faced with the idea of having
no Christmas at all...

09:52.959 --> 09:55.326
...drastic measures were called for.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.890
What's all that racket out there, Ma?

10:02.068 --> 10:06.005
It was just one of the reindeer
getting himself some exercise, dear.

10:06.639 --> 10:09.802
With all the rest
and relaxation around here...

10:09.876 --> 10:12.174
...everybody's jumpy as a leapfrog.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.506
It just isn't natural for this time of year.

10:15.715 --> 10:19.982
They'll get used to it. I have already.

10:20.887 --> 10:24.448
I tell you, this is life.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.688
If you say so, dear.

10:27.227 --> 10:32.063
Are you thinking that I'm doing
the wrong thing by staying home?

10:32.799 --> 10:36.429
Of course not, dear.
But if you should change your mind...

10:36.503 --> 10:39.905
Okay, what are you up to, Ma?

10:40.607 --> 10:42.371
Me? Up to something?

10:43.610 --> 10:44.634
Ridiculous.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.644
Do I look like I'm up to something?

10:46.713 --> 10:49.546
No, you don't look like
you're up to something...

10:49.616 --> 10:53.246
...but whenever you look like
you're not up to anything...

10:54.120 --> 10:55.610
...you're up to something.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.556
What are you up to, Ma?

10:58.625 --> 11:01.492
It's nothing that need concern you.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.494
Poor Jingle.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.459
Poor Jangle.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.699
Jingle! Jangle!

11:07.767 --> 11:10.759
Concern it, Ma. What's going on?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.037
They're only trying to help.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.998
Where are they?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.701
They thought they'd just browse
around the world...

11:17.810 --> 11:21.178
...and see if the folks didn't really care
about you and Christmas.

11:21.247 --> 11:25.150
You mean, they went down there
out into that...

11:25.618 --> 11:28.110
...cruel world by themselves?

11:28.288 --> 11:31.815
Of course not, silly.
Vixen went with them.

11:32.158 --> 11:36.026
Vixen! She's just a baby.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.223
Poor little girl.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.597
No telling what might happen.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.231
Now I'll have to go after them.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.503
Do you think you ought to, dear,
with your cold and all?

11:49.642 --> 11:51.041
I have to go.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.812
Those three won't even get
past the Miser brothers without...

11:54.881 --> 11:57.009
The Miser brothers, oh dear!

11:57.784 --> 11:59.912
I forgot all about those two.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.614
Of all the fool things for them to do.

12:02.689 --> 12:06.683
If Snow Miser doesn't freeze them
just for the fun of it...

12:06.759 --> 12:09.785
...his devil of a brother
will put the heat on them for sure.

12:11.497 --> 12:16.526
Dasher! On the double!

12:17.837 --> 12:21.364
Away, Dasher! Away!

12:24.611 --> 12:27.046
<i>The Miser brothers. What a pair!</i>

12:27.313 --> 12:30.840
<i>Snow Miser, who controls
the northern part of the world...</i>

12:30.917 --> 12:33.147
<i>...trying to turn everything to icicles...</i>

12:33.219 --> 12:36.211
<i>...and his nasty brother
trying to keep the south so hot...</i>

12:36.289 --> 12:38.314
<i>...with nary a snowflake a year.</i>

12:39.058 --> 12:41.425
<i>Thanks to me, Vixen, Jingle and Jangle...</i>

12:41.561 --> 12:43.757
<i>...were headed right between the two.</i>

12:43.863 --> 12:46.195
Where are we? Where are we heading?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.960
What do you think?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.598
Don't just stand there, you fools!

12:52.672 --> 12:55.300
They're part of the Santa Claus gang
of goody-goodies.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.706
They must be on their way
to start everybody grieving...

12:58.778 --> 13:00.439
...about white Christmas again.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.978
Don't let them get through.
Singe their britches for them.

13:07.053 --> 13:07.884
Get them.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.048
Get them!

13:11.157 --> 13:13.489
<i>Of course, I never dreamed
that little Vixen...</i>

13:13.559 --> 13:18.156
<i>...would make the mistake of flying
right smack into Heat Miser's territory.</i>

They got away. They got away!

13:39.118 --> 13:41.917
<i>Just a baby, perhaps,
but little Vixen pulled the boys...</i>

13:41.988 --> 13:43.581
<i>...out of a pretty tight spot.</i>

13:43.656 --> 13:45.624
I wonder where we are now?

13:45.692 --> 13:48.093
If you ask me, still in serious trouble.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.896
Look! Look down there.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.257
Southtown, U.S.A.

13:52.732 --> 13:56.066
That looks like as good a place as any
to find some Christmas spirit.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.500
Take her down, Vixen old girl.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.536
Where is everybody?

14:03.609 --> 14:05.509
Boy, that's what I'd like to know.

14:05.745 --> 14:09.773
How can we find any goodwill
if we can't even find any people?

14:12.385 --> 14:14.149
All right, buddy, pull over.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.743
What's the problem, Officer?

14:15.822 --> 14:18.757
"What's the problem?"
I'll tell you what the problem is.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.824
Driving a... Riding a...

14:21.661 --> 14:23.527
What do you call that thing anyway?

14:23.730 --> 14:24.856
That's Vixen.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.700
Riding a Vixen the wrong way
on a one-way street...

14:28.835 --> 14:30.428
...crossing the white line...

14:30.636 --> 14:33.799
...and wearing funny-looking suits
on a Sunday.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.738
But--

14:34.874 --> 14:36.672
Tell it to the judge.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.504
Maybe they don't like reindeer
in these parts.

14:39.946 --> 14:43.348
I know what! We'll make her a disguise.
Take your socks off.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.884
Take my socks off!

14:44.951 --> 14:46.316
Just do as you're told.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.057
And there we have "instant Rover."

14:51.357 --> 14:54.554
Now, let's take our dog for a walk...

14:54.627 --> 14:58.291
...and see if we can find
some Christmas spirit and goodwill.

15:00.666 --> 15:01.929
<i>Yoo-hoo, madam.</i>

15:02.001 --> 15:03.366
What do you want?

15:03.469 --> 15:05.961
I wonder if we might speak with you
for a moment.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.966
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

15:08.174 --> 15:11.576
At my age? Who are you?

15:11.778 --> 15:12.870
My name is--

15:12.945 --> 15:15.004
What on earth is that?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.711
That's our little puppy dog, Rover.

15:17.784 --> 15:18.808
A dog?

15:18.885 --> 15:21.684
Yep. Bark for the lady, Rover.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.493
Kitty cat. Kitty, come here.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.633
Yeah, I've seen them. Two little fellas
wearing goofy clothes.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.067
They didn't get into any trouble,
did they, Officer?

15:43.342 --> 15:44.901
I'll say they got in trouble.

15:44.977 --> 15:47.810
Wait until the judge gets finished
with them lawbreakers.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.905
He'll give them what for.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.950
Not much Christmas spirit there,
and just as I feared...

15:55.588 --> 15:57.386
...they're in trouble already.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.189
We better find them quick.
Poor little guys.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.486
Must be scared to death.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.294
I'm scared to death.

16:06.499 --> 16:10.527
Serves you right.
"Bark for the lady, Rover," indeed.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.369
Why don't we just skip the whole business
and go home?

16:14.507 --> 16:17.636
I'd like to, but I hate to let Mrs. C down.

16:17.977 --> 16:22.278
We've just got to find a trace of
Christmas spirit and goodwill somewhere.

16:22.548 --> 16:23.606
I know.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.050
Santa's favorites have always been
the little ones, the children.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.984
Why don't we talk to one of them?

16:29.055 --> 16:30.284
Good idea.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.960
There are a whole bunch
of children over there.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.254
Let's talk to them and get out of here...

16:36.329 --> 16:40.493
...because I think Vixen's coming down
with something. She's got a slight fever.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.895
Poor thing.
She's just not used to this weather.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.869
You just lay down here in the shade, girl.
We'll be right back.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.668
I beg your pardon, young man.
May we have a word with you?

16:52.879 --> 16:57.544
Sure. Hey, they're dressed up
like a couple of Christmas elves.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.819
Haven't you heard the news?
Santa's taking a holiday.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.649
Yeah, it was in all the papers.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.584
Well, you don't seem
to be very upset about it.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.752
Upset? Why should I be upset?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.260
Yeah, what's the big deal?

17:10.363 --> 17:13.094
You mean, you don't care
if Santa Claus comes or not?

17:13.366 --> 17:14.390
None of you?

17:14.467 --> 17:15.957
No.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.736
Of course not. It's none of our business.

17:18.804 --> 17:22.240
Besides, believing in Santa Claus
is for little kids.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.469
Yeah.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.008
This is serious.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.909
It's worse than I thought.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.478
If I were you guys, I wouldn't waste time
worrying about Santa Claus.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.642
You got a bigger problem.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.048
What do you mean?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.320
The dog catcher's got your pooch!

17:37.690 --> 17:38.657
Stop! Thief!

17:38.724 --> 17:40.658
- Reindeer-napper!
- You come back here!

17:40.726 --> 17:42.251
Who said you could...

17:42.328 --> 17:44.353
Vixen, hang on! Hang on!

17:46.799 --> 17:50.565
<i>A very nice boy. Ignatius Thistiewhite.
Nice name, too.</i>

17:51.070 --> 17:54.631
<i>He didn't know it at the time, but he was
going to be a much bigger help...</i>

17:54.707 --> 17:58.268
<i>...to the two little elves and to all of us
than he could ever imagine...</i>

17:58.711 --> 18:01.578
<i>...because a little later,
when he got home...</i>

18:01.647 --> 18:04.048
Hi, there, little fella.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.783
Can you spare a moment?

18:07.119 --> 18:11.317
Sure. My name's Ignatius Thistiewhite.
Everybody calls me Iggie.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.357
What's yours?

18:16.662 --> 18:19.825
Claus. Claus.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.663
What can I do for you, Mr. Claus?

18:21.834 --> 18:26.431
I'm looking for two friends of mine.
Tiny little fellas.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.131
Red shoes.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.643
You must mean the two guys
I met at school.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.442
They were asking us about Christmas
and stuff.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.976
Ignatius, was that you I heard sneeze?

18:40.052 --> 18:43.022
Not me, Mom. It was my friend, Mr. Claus.

18:43.456 --> 18:48.155
Why don't you bring him inside and talk,
and I'll give him something for that cold?

18:49.528 --> 18:52.088
Mom, Dad, meet Mr. Claus.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.099
How do you do?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.911
You poor man. Drink this.
It'll make you feel much better.

19:10.182 --> 19:12.048
Thank you.

19:13.119 --> 19:16.885
You say my friends
were asking you about Christmas?

19:17.456 --> 19:21.393
Yeah. They wanted to know
if we kids cared about Santa Claus and all.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.950
What did you tell them?

19:23.696 --> 19:26.757
Heck, I don't believe
in Santa Claus anymore.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.064
That's kid stuff. isn't it?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.832
Just as I thought.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.633
You don't believe in Santa Claus,
do you, Dad?

19:37.777 --> 19:40.337
Why, yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.442
How about you?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.146
Me?

19:45.317 --> 19:48.343
Why, of course, I do.

19:51.624 --> 19:55.561
"I believe in Santa Claus

19:56.495 --> 19:59.556
"Like I believe in love

20:01.267 --> 20:04.259
"I believe in Santa Claus

20:05.337 --> 20:08.671
"And everything he does

20:09.208 --> 20:13.236
"There's no question in my mind

20:14.246 --> 20:17.079
"That he does exist

20:18.150 --> 20:22.314
"Just like love I know he's there

20:23.622 --> 20:25.920
"Waiting to be missed

20:29.095 --> 20:33.589
"I believe in Santa Claus

20:34.433 --> 20:37.425
"But there was a time

20:37.937 --> 20:41.805
<i>"I thought I had grown too old</i>

20:42.875 --> 20:46.334
<i>"For such a childish rhyme</i>

20:46.645 --> 20:50.809
<i>"He became a dream to me</i>

20:50.916 --> 20:54.784
<i>"Till one Christmas night</i>

20:55.654 --> 20:59.852
<i>"Someone stood beside my bed</i>

21:00.726 --> 21:03.661
<i>"With a beard of white</i>

21:05.664 --> 21:10.659
<i>"'So, you're too old for Santa Claus?'</i>

21:11.837 --> 21:14.898
<i>"He said with a smile</i>

21:15.040 --> 21:19.375
<i>â€œThen you're too old for all the things</i>

21:20.146 --> 21:23.309
<i>â€œThat make a life worthwhile</i>

21:23.749 --> 21:26.275
<i>â€œFor what is happiness</i>

21:26.719 --> 21:31.919
<i>â€œBut dreams until they all come true</i>

21:33.359 --> 21:37.387
<i>"'Look at me and tell me, son</i>

21:38.397 --> 21:41.594
<i>â€œWhat is real to you'</i>

21:43.803 --> 21:48.400
"Just believe in Santa Claus

21:48.507 --> 21:52.341
"Like you believe in love

21:52.411 --> 21:57.212
"Just believe in Santa Claus

21:57.483 --> 22:01.010
"And everything he does

22:01.086 --> 22:05.819
"Wipe that question from your mind

22:05.958 --> 22:09.861
"Yes, he does exist

22:10.162 --> 22:14.929
"Just like love you know he's there

22:15.201 --> 22:18.694
"Waiting to be missed

22:21.874 --> 22:27.005
"Just like love I know he's there

22:28.380 --> 22:34.149
"Waiting to be missed"

22:39.158 --> 22:41.684
I guess, if you're not too old
to still believe...

22:42.194 --> 22:43.821
...well, I guess, maybe--

22:48.534 --> 22:51.595
By the way,
when my friends left the schoolyard...

22:51.670 --> 22:53.729
...did they say where they were going?

22:54.740 --> 22:56.003
Oh, my gosh.

22:56.575 --> 23:00.273
I almost forgot.
They were chasing the dog catcher's truck.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.808
They were what?

23:01.881 --> 23:05.681
He was taking their dog away in his truck
and they were trying to catch him.

23:05.751 --> 23:08.880
Their dog? Good grief!

23:10.489 --> 23:11.388
Vixen!

23:12.157 --> 23:16.025
<i>Poor little Vixen,
so frightened and sick in the dog pound.</i>

23:16.161 --> 23:20.723
<i>It was one of those days when things
just kept going from bad to worse.</i>

23:31.543 --> 23:35.343
<i>Santa wanted to get Vixen
out of that dog pound and quick.</i>

23:35.881 --> 23:39.579
<i>Ordinarily, Santa doesn't like
to show off his flying reindeer...</i>

23:39.652 --> 23:42.314
<i>...in front of people, but he was in a rush.</i>

23:42.788 --> 23:44.722
Gosh, did you see that?

23:45.090 --> 23:46.558
I certainly did.

23:46.625 --> 23:49.686
I thought there was something different
about that man.

23:50.229 --> 23:53.221
Mr. Claus. He must be...

23:53.432 --> 23:57.027
Wouldn't surprise me a bit.
At the moment, nothing would.

23:57.803 --> 24:01.103
Then his friends must be real elves
and their dog...

24:01.941 --> 24:04.171
I'll bet that dog was a baby reindeer.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.577
That's bad. They won't know how
to take care of a reindeer at the dog pound.

24:08.647 --> 24:11.241
I wish there was something I could do.

24:11.317 --> 24:15.254
When you've got a big problem, Son,
it often pays to go right to the top man.

24:15.788 --> 24:19.349
Why don't you stop by the mayor's office?
Tell him the whole story.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.458
He should be able to help.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.291
Good idea, Dad.

24:24.163 --> 24:28.293
<i>Well, it just so happened that Jingle
and Jangle had the same good idea...</i>

24:28.767 --> 24:32.135
<i>...when the men at the dog pound refused
to let Vixen go...</i>

24:32.404 --> 24:35.499
<i>...he suggested that they take their case
to the mayor.</i>

24:39.545 --> 24:42.810
Now, let me see if I got this straight.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.544
You two are elves...

24:47.720 --> 24:50.451
...and that dog down at the pound...

24:50.756 --> 24:52.417
...is a reindeer...

24:53.292 --> 24:56.557
...and you want to take him back
to Santa Claus.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.493
At the North Pole.

25:02.401 --> 25:05.598
You see, your honor,
we're here on a special mission.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.231
A secret mission.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.502
A secret mission. I should have guessed.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.212
'Cause Santa isn't coming this year.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.073
He wants to take a holiday.

25:19.918 --> 25:22.615
No more, please. I can't take any more.

25:22.988 --> 25:26.356
Reindeer, Santa Claus, elves.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.694
But, we are elves. We're serious.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.194
How can we convince you?

25:32.898 --> 25:35.868
Come on, son.
What kind of fool do you think I am?

25:36.135 --> 25:40.697
You ain't got the chance of a snowball
in Southtown of convincing me...

25:41.206 --> 25:43.607
...one-tenth of your story's on the level.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.907
A snowball in Southtown?
What kind of chance is that?

25:48.113 --> 25:50.741
Not very good. It never snows here.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.117
Well, not in the last 100 years.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.687
I've got an idea.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.520
You elves can work magic and all that.

26:00.225 --> 26:04.492
You conjure up a good old-fashioned
white Christmas for us...

26:04.663 --> 26:06.427
...right here in Southtown...

26:06.498 --> 26:08.796
...and I'll buy every word you say.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.028
You will?

26:10.102 --> 26:13.766
I'll spring your reindeer
from the hoosegow.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.967
I'll call all the mayors in the U.S. of A.

26:18.277 --> 26:22.805
We'll give Santa
an official national holiday this year.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.416
It's a deal.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.285
Good-bye, your honor.
We've got lots to do.

26:32.357 --> 26:35.554
Yeah, see you all on the ski slopes,
Mr. Mayor.

26:41.934 --> 26:45.768
"It's gonna snow, ho, ho,
right here in Dixie

26:46.271 --> 26:48.467
"All will be white overnight

26:48.540 --> 26:52.477
"It will be cold on Christmas day, hey, hey

26:52.544 --> 26:54.308
"Right here in Dixie

26:54.446 --> 26:58.440
"We'll do-si-do in the snow
so I've been told

26:58.951 --> 27:02.888
"We'll build a snowman,
our very first

27:03.288 --> 27:07.987
"Take down the strawman
and bundle up our winter's work

27:09.795 --> 27:13.288
"It's gonna snow, ho, ho
right here in Dixie

27:14.032 --> 27:17.263
"All will be white overnight
It will be cold

27:17.536 --> 27:22.098
"It will be cold on Christmas day, hey, hey
right here in Dixie

27:22.908 --> 27:25.070
"We'll do-si-do in the snow

27:25.244 --> 27:30.080
"So we've been told"

27:32.084 --> 27:36.817
Now, take it easy, girl. I paid your fine.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.218
We'll be going home now.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.384
A real reindeer. How do you like that?

27:42.794 --> 27:44.660
Aren't they supposed to be up north?

27:44.730 --> 27:48.826
That's why she's so sick.
She can't take this warm weather.

27:49.701 --> 27:51.169
I've got to get her home.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.032
I hope I'm not too late.

27:55.974 --> 27:57.999
There we go, girl.

28:00.312 --> 28:03.612
If anybody should come by
asking about her...

28:03.682 --> 28:05.172
Two funny little characters.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.515
They were here about an hour ago,
but they couldn't pay the fine.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.521
I told them to go see the mayor.

28:11.557 --> 28:14.424
What am I gonna do about those two?

28:15.594 --> 28:17.585
Don't you worry, Vixen.

28:18.597 --> 28:21.066
I'm gonna take care of you first.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.903
<i>Santa was worried
about Jingle and Jangle...</i>

28:29.975 --> 28:33.206
<i>...but he had an even more serious prob!em
on his hands.</i>

28:33.712 --> 28:36.613
<i>If he didn't get Vixen back
to the North Pole fast...</i>

28:37.149 --> 28:41.416
<i>...well, who knows what might happen
to the littlest reindeer of the team.</i>

28:43.121 --> 28:47.183
<i>Things looked pretty grim from where
Jingle, Jangle and young Iggie sat.</i>

28:47.693 --> 28:51.220
<i>As far as they knew,
Vixen was still in the pound...</i>

28:51.630 --> 28:55.965
<i>...and they were faced with the problem
of making it snow in Southtown.</i>

28:56.768 --> 29:00.932
<i>Well, all seemed lost,
but Jingle got a brilliant idea.</i>

29:02.708 --> 29:06.201
Mrs. Claus. If anybody can figure
a way out of this mess...

29:06.345 --> 29:07.437
...she can.

29:07.512 --> 29:10.072
How about calling Mrs. Santa Claus?

29:10.849 --> 29:13.511
Good idea. Why didn't I think of that?

29:17.623 --> 29:19.648
She should be along any minute now.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.254
I hope she doesn't wake my folks up.

29:23.028 --> 29:24.723
Here she comes now!

29:28.133 --> 29:29.100
Gosh!

29:29.968 --> 29:33.962
Hop on, boys. Hello, Iggie.
Say, "hello," Blitzen.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.298
Golly.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.904
Hi, Mrs. C. Where are we going?

29:38.977 --> 29:40.536
To see Snow Miser.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.023
Here he comes now, the big ham.

30:07.205 --> 30:09.902
"I'm Mr. White Christmas

30:09.975 --> 30:11.875
"I'm Mr. Snow

30:12.311 --> 30:14.678
"I'm Mr. Icicle

30:14.846 --> 30:17.076
"I'm Mr. Ten Below

30:17.683 --> 30:19.981
"Friends call me Snow Miser

30:20.185 --> 30:24.213
"Whatever I touch
turns to snow in my clutch

30:25.524 --> 30:26.958
"I'm too much

30:30.429 --> 30:32.921
"He's Mr. White Christmas

30:32.998 --> 30:35.399
-"He's Mr. Snow
-"That's right

30:35.467 --> 30:37.834
"He's Mr. Icicle

30:38.337 --> 30:40.101
"He's Mr. Ten Below

30:40.939 --> 30:43.237
"Friends call me Snow Miser

30:43.475 --> 30:47.105
"Whatever I touch
turns to snow in my clutch

30:48.680 --> 30:50.170
"He's too much

30:51.983 --> 30:56.386
"I never want to know a day
that's over 40 degrees

30:57.222 --> 31:02.353
"I'd rather have it 30, 20 and 5
and let it freeze

31:07.766 --> 31:10.133
"He's Mr. White Christmas

31:10.335 --> 31:12.736
-"He's Mr. Snow
-"That's right"

31:12.938 --> 31:15.600
"He's Mr. Icicle

31:15.707 --> 31:17.607
"He's Mr. Ten Below

31:18.343 --> 31:20.607
"Friends call me Snow Miser

31:20.912 --> 31:22.676
"Whatever I touch

31:23.148 --> 31:25.276
"Turns to snow in my clutch

31:26.618 --> 31:27.847
"Too much

31:29.054 --> 31:30.283
"Too much"

31:32.758 --> 31:35.284
Well, Mrs. Claus, how's your hubby?

31:35.827 --> 31:38.762
I'm afraid he's got
a pretty bad cold, Snowy.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.624
That's a shame, the poor fellow.

31:42.134 --> 31:45.934
He should have come to see me.
I'd have given him a good one.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.429
A little chilly humor there.

31:49.975 --> 31:52.467
Don't you dare make fun
of Santa Claus like that!

31:52.544 --> 31:54.740
He's the nicest person in the whole world.

31:54.813 --> 31:57.544
Of course he is, sonny. I love him a lot.

31:57.783 --> 31:58.545
You do?

31:58.617 --> 32:00.312
Of course I do, silly.

32:00.385 --> 32:03.411
He's the best advertisement
snow biz ever had.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.951
Now, what can I do for you, madam?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.685
We need a snowstorm.

32:10.829 --> 32:13.161
No sooner said than done, my little icicle.

32:13.632 --> 32:18.035
- Where do you want it?
- In a town called Southtown, U.S.A.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.705
What? Hold it.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.998
Hold it!

32:23.775 --> 32:25.140
No can do, Mrs. C.

32:26.044 --> 32:29.014
The south is under the control
of my stepbrother, Heat Miser.

32:29.181 --> 32:32.207
Every time I try to send
a little refreshing snow down there...

32:32.417 --> 32:37.355
...what does he do? He turns it into rain
or fog, and who needs that?

32:37.756 --> 32:40.453
If I get his okay, will you make it snow?

32:40.759 --> 32:45.788
Sure thing. But don't get your hopes up.
You'll never get anywhere with that one.

32:46.031 --> 32:48.557
We'll have to try. Thanks, Snowy.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.393
Don't mention it,
and don't be such a stranger.

32:52.504 --> 32:56.168
Stop by with your hubby sometime
and we'll have a blizzard.

33:01.179 --> 33:02.305
Where to now?

33:02.581 --> 33:05.175
You heard the man.
We've got to see Heat Miser.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.215
I was afraid you'd say that.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.851
On, Blitzen!

33:22.133 --> 33:25.159
"I'm Mr. Green Christmas

33:25.237 --> 33:27.763
"I'm Mr. Sun

33:28.440 --> 33:31.273
"I'm Mr. Heat Blister

33:31.877 --> 33:34.471
"I'm Mr. 101

34:16.888 --> 34:19.949
"I never want to know a day

34:20.025 --> 34:22.722
"That's under 60 degrees

34:23.161 --> 34:26.960
"I'd rather have it 80, 90

"100 degrees

34:58.129 --> 34:59.563
"I'm too much

35:01.733 --> 35:03.030
"Too much"

35:06.438 --> 35:10.534
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Claus.
Where's your husband?

35:10.842 --> 35:13.277
Out doing another commercial
for my brother?

35:13.478 --> 35:17.244
Come now. You know Santa isn't
on your brother's payroll.

35:17.549 --> 35:20.348
Well, then, he's grossly unfair, that's what.

35:20.418 --> 35:22.887
Traipsing around
in that stupid sleigh of his...

35:23.121 --> 35:26.352
...stirring up cold winter breezes,
and causing everybody...

35:26.424 --> 35:29.826
...to think fondly of snowball fights
and sleigh rides...

35:30.829 --> 35:32.126
...and ice hockey.

35:32.397 --> 35:34.365
I assure you, it's not intentional.

35:34.432 --> 35:37.697
Why doesn't he wear a bathing suit
and drive a sand buggy.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.668
But we live at the North Pole.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.296
And he could sing the praises
of heat and rain!

35:42.374 --> 35:43.773
I'll see what I can do.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.572
In the meantime, will you do us a favor?

35:46.745 --> 35:50.204
I don't see why I should.
Nobody ever does anything for me.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.140
But what is it?

35:52.884 --> 35:56.479
Could you let it snow?
Just for one day in the south.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.654
What? Snow in the south?

36:00.125 --> 36:01.718
Just for one day.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.222
Never!

36:07.432 --> 36:09.161
Unless...

36:09.234 --> 36:13.068
...there were something in it for me?

36:13.438 --> 36:14.496
Like what?

36:15.740 --> 36:19.802
Like, for instance,
if a little bit of northern territory...

36:20.011 --> 36:24.778
...were turned over to me.
Shall we say, the North Pole?

36:25.483 --> 36:29.681
Well, heavens, I don't know.
That would be up to your brother, not me.

36:30.088 --> 36:33.490
Well, why don't you give
the tutti-frutti snowcone...

36:33.591 --> 36:36.219
...a buzz on the hotline
and see what he says?

36:38.730 --> 36:39.754
Hello?

36:40.498 --> 36:42.398
Snowy, this is Mrs. Claus.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.766
<i>Hi there, sugarplum.
How'd you make out with the hothead?</i>

36:45.837 --> 36:48.204
I heard that, you snowball!

36:48.273 --> 36:50.139
<i>Oh, my goodness, speak of the devil.</i>

36:50.275 --> 36:53.836
Madam, kindly state your business
with that drippy snowman...

36:53.912 --> 36:55.380
...and get him out of here.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.108
<i>Mind your blood pressure, hotcakes.</i>

36:57.182 --> 37:00.117
<i>Mother warned you about that
low boiling point of yours.</i>

37:00.351 --> 37:03.116
You think you're hot stuff
just 'cause Mother likes you best.

37:03.188 --> 37:05.919
Boys, boys. Now, please, don't fight.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.856
<i>If I can't have a little fun,
I might as well leave.</i>

37:07.926 --> 37:10.793
Your brother agreed to let it snow
in the south.

37:10.895 --> 37:11.953
<i>He did?</i>

37:12.130 --> 37:15.794
Of course, there has to be
a small concession on your part.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.095
<i>Really? What does the flaming fool
want this time?</i>

37:19.204 --> 37:20.535
<i>The North Pole?</i>

37:22.674 --> 37:24.870
Yes, as a matter of fact.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.377
<i>What?</i>

37:26.845 --> 37:28.813
I told you he wouldn't cooperate.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.214
<i>Cooperate? Surrender the North Pole,
you call "cooperate"?</i>

37:32.817 --> 37:35.047
<i>I have a good mind
to chill your embers for you.</i>

37:35.120 --> 37:36.246
Oh, yeah?

37:38.356 --> 37:39.983
All right, enough of this.

37:40.058 --> 37:43.653
I hate to do this to you, boys,
but you leave me no choice.

37:44.195 --> 37:45.663
I'm going over your heads.

37:45.730 --> 37:46.458
<i>You're kidding.</i>

37:46.531 --> 37:48.090
You wouldn't dare!

37:48.366 --> 37:50.130
I would, and I will.

37:51.636 --> 37:54.799
Mrs. Claus? You see what you did,
you old blizzard?

37:54.906 --> 37:56.374
She's going to tell Mother.

37:56.474 --> 37:59.637
<i>I did, you hot dog? It's all your fault!</i>

37:59.944 --> 38:01.036
Come along.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.104
We're not really going to do it,
are we, Mrs. Claus?

38:04.649 --> 38:08.279
I mean, we're not actually
going to disturb her?

38:08.887 --> 38:10.548
She's not serious.

38:10.655 --> 38:12.987
We're not really...

38:13.458 --> 38:15.654
Are we actually going to see...

38:15.860 --> 38:16.793
Yes.

38:17.262 --> 38:18.127
No.

38:18.930 --> 38:22.924
Who? Where are we going?
Who are we going to see?

38:23.268 --> 38:26.067
We're going right to the top, Iggie, my boy.

38:26.704 --> 38:31.767
Mrs. C is through fooling around.
We're gonna see none other than...

38:32.177 --> 38:33.872
...Mother Nature.

38:34.479 --> 38:35.446
Gosh.

38:36.181 --> 38:39.116
<i>I must admit,
I was more than a little nervous myself.</i>

38:39.651 --> 38:43.884
<i>I'd never met Mother Nature,
but I knew she didn't like to be disturbed.</i>

38:54.799 --> 38:57.200
<i>As I said, I was pretty nervous myself.</i>

38:57.535 --> 39:00.869
<i>I had no idea what to expect
of Mother Nature.</i>

39:01.339 --> 39:04.274
<i>But, frightened as we were,
we were that determined...</i>

39:04.342 --> 39:06.572
<i>...that Santa should have his holiday.</i>

39:09.881 --> 39:13.078
So they gave you a hard time,
did they, Mrs. Claus?

39:13.885 --> 39:15.717
I'm sure they didn't mean to.

39:16.254 --> 39:19.952
Yes, they did.
They're nasty little boys, both of them.

39:21.392 --> 39:22.791
Well, I wouldn't say...

39:22.861 --> 39:25.330
I'll straighten them out for you.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.825
Children.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.777
What is it, Mother dear?

39:41.613 --> 39:44.878
Mrs. Claus made a very simple request.

39:45.817 --> 39:49.276
Now, you let a little snow fall
in Southland...

39:50.488 --> 39:56.052
...and you allow just one nice spring day
at the North Pole.

39:56.961 --> 40:01.558
All you have to do is compromise.
At this time of the year, especially...

40:01.900 --> 40:06.497
...Santa needs some examples
of the Christmas spirit...

40:06.838 --> 40:10.502
...and we must set a good example
for the people down there to follow.

40:10.708 --> 40:13.040
So, boys, please!

40:15.847 --> 40:17.372
I won't do it!

40:17.749 --> 40:18.648
Me, neither.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.411
Stop it!

40:21.719 --> 40:23.312
Yes, Mother dear.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.315
They're really nice boys, Mrs. Claus.

40:27.725 --> 40:32.322
Sometimes they bicker, but you'll have
no further trouble with them.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.296
I do hope Santa enjoys his holiday.

40:36.634 --> 40:38.329
How can I ever thank you?

40:38.970 --> 40:40.563
Don't mention it.

40:53.084 --> 40:57.521
Well, little girl, I guess,
you're going to be all right after all.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.223
What's this?

41:02.961 --> 41:06.226
"Dear Santa,
I had to go meet Jingle and Jangle.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.632
"Will be back soon."

41:10.101 --> 41:11.500
That's a relief.

41:11.769 --> 41:15.137
Ma will look after those two. She will.

41:15.740 --> 41:20.337
Now, I can stay home
and look after my cold.

41:29.687 --> 41:32.987
Kids, look at the snow. it's really snowing.

41:35.593 --> 41:37.584
Yes, dear, I'll be home early.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.097
Well, I should be leaving here
in a few minutes.

41:42.367 --> 41:43.960
What's that?

41:44.569 --> 41:46.628
Don't forget to wear my what?

41:48.740 --> 41:51.107
Galoshes? What on earth for?

41:52.577 --> 41:55.274
It's snowing, is it? In that case, I'll...

41:56.180 --> 41:57.375
What?

41:57.915 --> 42:00.009
Snow in Southtown?

42:00.852 --> 42:05.153
I guess those fellas weren't pulling my leg
about Santa Claus after all.

42:07.492 --> 42:11.019
Santa, wake up. Look at these headlines!

42:11.562 --> 42:16.523
Yes. Listen to this,
"Mayors Declare Legal Holiday for Santa."

42:16.601 --> 42:19.434
"Snow Falls for First Time in Southtown."

42:19.504 --> 42:23.407
And, get this: "Day Off for Santa."

42:23.474 --> 42:26.171
Yes, and these all say the same.

42:27.011 --> 42:29.673
Well, Mama, I guess you proved your point.

42:30.348 --> 42:34.046
There is some goodwill in the hearts
of all men at this time of year.

42:34.485 --> 42:38.115
This, especially, proves it.

42:39.157 --> 42:42.752
The world gave me a vacation.

42:55.139 --> 42:59.736
<i>Fast as a hurricane,
children hurled the happy message...</i>

42:59.811 --> 43:01.142
<i>...around the world.</i>

43:01.879 --> 43:04.280
<i>Over each continent, isle, and isthmus...</i>

43:04.348 --> 43:07.010
<i>... "Let's give Santa a Merry Christmas."</i>

43:07.885 --> 43:10.513
<i>With snow,
the earth was already whitening.</i>

43:10.822 --> 43:13.757
<i>They rolled up their sleeves
and worked like lightning.</i>

43:14.058 --> 43:15.890
<i>They opened their piggy banks.</i>

43:16.060 --> 43:17.550
<i>They racked their brains.</i>

43:17.628 --> 43:22.759
<i>They chartered buses and special trains
to reach the Pole by the 24th...</i>

43:23.000 --> 43:24.434
<i>...was all their goal.</i>

43:24.836 --> 43:27.828
<i>East, west, north and south...</i>

43:27.905 --> 43:29.805
<i>...came gifts and gifts...</i>

43:29.874 --> 43:33.811
<i>...and gifts to spare
from clever children everywhere.</i>

43:34.178 --> 43:38.775
<i>Tots who hadn't a penny to spend,
wrote him a letter signed, â€œa friend.â€œ</i>

43:39.484 --> 43:42.977
<i>They had more fun
that strange December, they said...</i>

43:43.387 --> 43:45.549
<i>...than any they could remember.</i>

43:57.168 --> 43:59.637
Well, look at this.

44:05.443 --> 44:09.141
What's this? Why, it's a letter for me.

44:10.248 --> 44:11.443
"Dear Santa..."

44:12.183 --> 44:18.179
<i>"I'll have a blue Christmas</i>

44:18.422 --> 44:21.414
<i>"Without you</i>

44:22.126 --> 44:26.393
<i>"I'll be so blue</i>

44:26.464 --> 44:31.595
<i>"Thinking about you</i>

44:32.537 --> 44:37.270
<i>"Decorations are great</i>

44:37.375 --> 44:42.074
<i>"On a green Christmas tree</i>

44:44.248 --> 44:47.240
<i>"Won't mean a thing</i>

44:47.785 --> 44:51.153
<i>"If you're not here with me</i>

44:51.489 --> 44:56.757
<i>"I'll have a blue Christmas</i>

44:57.828 --> 45:00.320
<i>"That's certain</i>

45:01.399 --> 45:06.667
<i>"And when that blue heartache</i>

45:07.371 --> 45:10.432
<i>"Starts hurting</i>

45:11.609 --> 45:16.308
<i>"You'll be doing all right</i>

45:16.581 --> 45:21.610
<i>"With your Christmas so bright</i>

45:22.820 --> 45:27.883
<i>"But I'll have a blue</i>

45:28.025 --> 45:33.691
<i>"Blue Christmas"</i>

45:40.905 --> 45:42.066
Santa, look!

45:42.206 --> 45:43.674
Presents from the children.

45:43.741 --> 45:47.143
Christmas presents for Santa Claus.
Can you imagine that?

45:47.845 --> 45:49.904
<i>Santa was silent for a minute.</i>

45:50.047 --> 45:53.039
<i>His eye looked bright but a tear stood in it.</i>

45:53.351 --> 45:56.582
<i>And then, he blew his nose
like a trumpet blast.</i>

46:01.525 --> 46:03.323
God bless my soul.

46:03.961 --> 46:05.122
<i>...he said at last.</i>

46:05.630 --> 46:09.294
By the Big Borealis,
by my maps and charts...

46:09.934 --> 46:12.699
...I didn't know children
had such kind hearts.

46:13.204 --> 46:16.970
How could a man feel gladder? Prouder?

46:17.441 --> 46:20.741
<i>Then he turned away
and blew his nose louder.</i>

46:25.883 --> 46:27.578
Isn't it wonderful, dear?

46:28.052 --> 46:31.716
When we told all the children
you needed a holiday, they all agreed.

46:31.956 --> 46:34.926
So, this year,
they brought Christmas to you.

46:35.293 --> 46:38.786
A holiday! Nonsense!

46:39.964 --> 46:44.868
Well, why is everybody standing around?
There's work to be done!

46:45.036 --> 46:46.470
Load up the sleigh!

46:46.704 --> 46:49.674
Harness the team! Fetch my coat!

46:50.408 --> 46:52.069
But what about your gout?

46:52.143 --> 46:53.838
And the crick in your spine?

46:53.911 --> 46:55.106
And your aches?

46:56.280 --> 46:59.807
My back feels fine! Never felt younger!

46:59.984 --> 47:01.645
Never felt stronger!

47:01.952 --> 47:05.582
Haven't got a symptom any longer.

47:08.793 --> 47:13.253
Now, pile all those toys inside.
There's no time to waste.

47:13.998 --> 47:16.524
Tonight, we ride!

47:30.648 --> 47:31.877
I don't believe it.

47:32.116 --> 47:34.016
Hello! Merry Christmas!

47:34.185 --> 47:36.449
<i>"Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus</i>

47:36.754 --> 47:38.916

48:14.458 --> 48:19.123
<i>â€œcause Santa Claus comes tonight"</i>

48:28.572 --> 48:31.371
<i>Well, I've heard the old people often say...</i>

48:31.442 --> 48:34.241
<i>...that there never was such
a Christmas Day...</i>

48:34.645 --> 48:39.583
...and that's one reason, you may believe
why children are merry on Christmas Eve.

48:40.584 --> 48:43.212
<i>You know yourself,
as you hang your stockings...</i>

48:43.287 --> 48:45.619
<i>...it doesn't matter
if the winds are knocking.</i>

48:46.424 --> 48:50.884
<i>Though the great gale roars,
and nobody else would budge outdoors...</i>

48:52.196 --> 48:54.961

on fingers and thumbs...</i>

He looked peaceful and bright</i>
