00:24.529 --> 00:26.487
Are you all right?

00:26.615 --> 00:28.607
I'm barred.

00:28.742 --> 00:31.315
I've got, like, $10,000 in chips,

00:31.453 --> 00:34.205
and I cannot cash it.

00:34.331 --> 00:36.739
Look, if I kept an eye on you two,

00:36.875 --> 00:40.326
could you please just go in there
and just claim my money?

00:40.462 --> 00:44.507
Sure, we can do that for you,
but you don't have to keep your eye on us.

00:44.633 --> 00:46.210
We're honest people.

00:46.343 --> 00:50.969
I'm sure you are, but, come on,
if I'm gonna be giving you ten grand in chips,

00:51.098 --> 00:53.423
I just gotta know that you're coming back.

00:53.558 --> 00:55.551
We could give you a deposit.

00:55.686 --> 00:58.473
What kind of deposit?

00:58.605 --> 01:02.603
$2,000 would give me peace of mind.

01:02.734 --> 01:04.561
You do that,

01:04.694 --> 01:07.980
I will give you back your deposit
plus another thousand.

01:13.036 --> 01:15.362
I'm sorry, sir, I can't cash this for you.

01:15.497 --> 01:16.991
What? Why?

01:17.124 --> 01:18.404
They're worthless.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.792
(Car starts)

01:30.637 --> 01:31.918
(Gunshot)

01:32.723 --> 01:34.632
(Tyres screech)

01:34.766 --> 01:37.471
The guy was running
one of the oldest scams in Vegas.

01:37.603 --> 01:41.932
Would have got away with it too, until the
getaway driver put a nickel in the guy's jukebox.

01:42.065 --> 01:43.607
Those are the Ortons from Florida.

01:43.734 --> 01:45.773
Are you sure about that?

01:47.070 --> 01:50.404
The couple ID'd the deceased as the con man.

01:55.912 --> 01:57.739
That's the Ortons' money

01:57.873 --> 01:59.616
It's mine now.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.826
- Surveillance?
- Not in the garage.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.829
Banana skids and fresh blood. That helps.

02:07.966 --> 02:10.291
Oil slick doesn't hurt us either.

02:10.426 --> 02:11.755
Hey, Jim.

02:11.887 --> 02:13.714
- Got these from the cage.
- Thanks, Sam.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.967
The chip clip. Haven't seen that one in a while.

02:21.146 --> 02:23.139
Striking resemblance to Judas.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.100
How's that?

02:25.233 --> 02:27.771
Both lost their lives
over a worthless bag of chips.

<i>Punk rock music on hi-fi</i>

03:09.152 --> 03:11.145
Hey, Sanders. No punk rock.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.987
What about Black Flag?

03:13.115 --> 03:15.191
Are you nuts?

03:19.079 --> 03:20.657
Whoa! Careful.

03:20.789 --> 03:24.372
- Livestock. Hissing roaches from Madagascar.
- Sorry.

03:24.501 --> 03:26.494
These babies run 2 1/2 miles an hour.

03:26.837 --> 03:30.621
- I don't doubt it for a minute.
- 5th Annual Entomological Convention. Duluth.

03:30.757 --> 03:32.335
Cockroach racing finals.

03:32.467 --> 03:34.259
You're roach racing?

03:34.386 --> 03:37.885
Actually, I'm giving a tutorial
in preserving mass crime scenes.

03:38.015 --> 03:39.723
The sideshow is racing these guys.

03:39.850 --> 03:43.053
To nave a chance to run
against legendary roaches

03:43.186 --> 03:48.394
like Cocky Balboa, The Drain Lover,
Priscilla, Queen Of The Gutters. It's huge.

03:48.525 --> 03:50.482
- What do you feed those guys?
- Dog food.

03:50.611 --> 03:53.944
- And who's supervising Night shift?
- You are.

03:54.072 --> 03:56.943
Me? I am on the red-eye to Reno.

03:57.075 --> 03:59.780
The Braun family is opening a new casino.
I am Sam's date.

03:59.911 --> 04:01.904
That's tonight?

04:02.039 --> 04:04.245
I told you once. Memoed you twice.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.493
Man, these guys are primed.

04:11.673 --> 04:13.417
You better get somebody.

04:13.550 --> 04:16.468
A-slash? Acting supervisor.

04:16.595 --> 04:19.596
What about Nick? He's got seniority.

04:19.723 --> 04:21.762
Or Sara. She'd jump at the chance.

04:21.892 --> 04:24.098
If it was about seniority, I'd ask Nick.

04:24.227 --> 04:26.434
For staying up three straight days, I'd ask Sara.

04:26.563 --> 04:29.232
- Instead, I want you.
- And if I ask why?

04:29.358 --> 04:32.109
Your curiosity
would be better served on the case.

04:32.235 --> 04:36.067
The shooting death of a con man
at the Tropicana. Our guys are already there.

04:36.198 --> 04:38.190
Hang on.

04:38.325 --> 04:40.994
Have you told Nick and Sara about this?

04:41.119 --> 04:42.400
No.

05:44.182 --> 05:45.890
I got one left

05:46.018 --> 05:47.216
Smile.

05:49.146 --> 05:50.688
- Lovely.
- Hey.

05:51.523 --> 05:54.441
- Nice of you to show up.
- We're done here, brother.

05:54.568 --> 05:56.395
I'm sorry. I got detained.

05:56.528 --> 05:59.862
- You did a one-to-one on these treads?
- Yeah, I just finished.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.066
- Put together an evidence list?
- No.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.901
- You gotta do it. You were late.
- I don't think so. I gotta go back with the body.

06:08.165 --> 06:12.910
Sara, can you get back to the lab
and put a rush on this analysis?

06:13.045 --> 06:16.414
- Who died and made you boss?
- He's not exactly dead.

06:18.342 --> 06:20.251
Grissom gave you the shift tonight.

06:26.141 --> 06:28.679
Anything you wanna say?

06:28.810 --> 06:30.554
Yeah.

06:30.687 --> 06:32.347
Good luck.

06:43.241 --> 06:45.234
Get a speeding ticket?

06:45.369 --> 06:48.453
Side roads. So...

06:48.580 --> 06:50.620
this is our con artiste

06:50.749 --> 06:53.074
Vincent Thomas Avery. ID'd him from his prints.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.783
- Tell you anything?
- No mystery in cause of death.

06:55.921 --> 06:57.581
Gunshot wound to the outer ear.

06:57.714 --> 07:00.501
Left ear at that

07:00.634 --> 07:02.673
Probably when he was getting into the car.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.429
He knew the driver.

07:07.557 --> 07:11.638
Soot deposition on the skin
surrounding the entry wound tells the story.

07:11.770 --> 07:16.681
The bullet entered the external
auditory meatus fracturing the skull base

07:16.817 --> 07:19.734
- The hardest bone of the skull.
- You got any pictures of that?

07:19.861 --> 07:21.735
Hot off the fluoroscope.

07:21.863 --> 07:23.856
Haven't had the pleasure yet.

07:26.326 --> 07:28.449
Hello! There is your bullet.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.663
Deformed projectile
on the right side of the calvarium.

07:31.790 --> 07:33.996
- Can you fish that out for me?
- You bet.

07:36.295 --> 07:37.837
Wait a minute.

07:42.634 --> 07:44.627
There's something in his stomach

07:56.773 --> 08:00.273
Something tells me
this isn't filled with white sugar.

08:03.739 --> 08:06.858
- How many more are there?
- I'd say about 50 balloons

08:06.992 --> 08:12.864
The green dye you see here
is probably from lime-flavoured gelatine.

08:12.998 --> 08:15.287
Makes them much easier to swallow.

08:15.417 --> 08:17.410
He's a mule.

08:18.962 --> 08:24.419
Why is a guy trafficking in big-pay drugs wasting
his time on some nickel-and-dime chip scam?

08:26.178 --> 08:28.669
Hey. I got the horsepower on your vic.

08:28.805 --> 08:32.174
Vincent Avery. Age 28.
Con man out of Atlantic City.

08:32.308 --> 08:35.892
Enough petty thefts and grand larcenies
on his record to choke a hippo.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.059
Hey, Jim.

08:38.190 --> 08:40.859
What do you make of that void? Nail?

08:40.943 --> 08:42.734
Either that or a spot on your lens.

08:42.861 --> 08:45.696
Don't say that.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.571
Hey!

08:51.703 --> 08:54.740
You making a cake?
What's the hold-up on my pills?

08:54.873 --> 08:56.332
Process.

08:56.458 --> 09:00.076
Just because you got passed over,
don't take it out on me.

09:00.212 --> 09:01.836
He didn't pass me over.

09:01.964 --> 09:05.664
- Really? What would you call it, then?
- Grissom.

09:05.801 --> 09:07.081
Ah.

09:20.023 --> 09:21.268
Coal.

09:22.985 --> 09:24.183
Wood

09:25.529 --> 09:27.189
And coconut shells.

09:37.666 --> 09:40.916
Activated carbon. Activated charcoal pills.

09:41.044 --> 09:44.994
Best antacid in the world.
Coats the stomach and absorbs impurities.

09:45.132 --> 09:47.670
It's great if you're a mule transporting drugs.

09:47.801 --> 09:49.426
Our con man's a mule?

09:49.553 --> 09:52.222
We found balloons of cocaine
in his stomach cavity.

09:52.347 --> 09:54.838
Without the pills one bite of a chocolate bar

09:54.975 --> 09:58.142
would produce enough gastric acid
to eat away the balloon

09:58.270 --> 09:59.978
causing him to OD.

10:00.105 --> 10:02.774
- Then he went out and got shot.
- Speaking of which,

10:02.858 --> 10:05.147
I found airline stubs in Avery's shirt.

10:05.277 --> 10:07.151
- What?
- Vincent Avery was 4A,

10:07.279 --> 10:09.070
Ellie Rebecca was 4B.

10:09.197 --> 10:11.155
Strange, right, using two first names?

10:11.283 --> 10:15.494
What's strange is going into the evidence locker
after post and finding nothing left.

10:15.621 --> 10:17.613
Don't make me feel bad for doing my job.

10:17.748 --> 10:19.657
If it was your job, you couldn't feel bad.

10:21.043 --> 10:23.082
Well, I think I hear some coffee perking.

10:26.673 --> 10:29.793
What do you want from me?
I'm working the case. The case is hot.

10:29.927 --> 10:32.334
It's my case. Tonight, I'm the primary.

10:32.471 --> 10:36.468
I have to process it. If you have a problem
with that, you can clock out now.

10:38.644 --> 10:40.601
Am I clear?

10:41.772 --> 10:43.349
Clear.

11:37.536 --> 11:39.030
It couldn't be.

11:40.747 --> 11:43.784
Corner of Paradise and Main

11:46.670 --> 11:48.579
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:48.714 --> 11:50.623
You have a daughter?

11:52.467 --> 11:54.259
Where are you going with this?

11:54.386 --> 11:57.589
Her prints are on airline stubs
relating to tonight's homicide.

11:59.057 --> 12:02.011
There's got to be more than one Ellie Brass
in the world.

12:02.144 --> 12:03.721
Ellie Rebecca Brass?

12:03.854 --> 12:05.728
DOB 9/24/82.

12:05.856 --> 12:10.518
Essex County, New Jersey.
Last known address: 554 Applegate Way.

12:10.652 --> 12:12.277
OK, you told me.

12:12.404 --> 12:16.947
- I got to bring her in.
- PD brings in suspects. I'll put Vega on it.

12:17.075 --> 12:18.902
You're hands-off?

12:19.036 --> 12:21.574
Of course.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.289
Just go in, right in there.

12:55.322 --> 12:56.900
I'm fine.

12:58.367 --> 12:59.777
I'm fine.

13:01.286 --> 13:04.489
So, we're gonna pick up
right where we left off, huh, Ellie?

13:14.967 --> 13:17.504
You still documenting the money
from the con man?

13:17.636 --> 13:20.553
Every serial number. Evidence.

13:20.681 --> 13:25.473
Did you know that 9T% of all 100-dollar bills
have traces of cocaine on them?

13:25.602 --> 13:27.595
I was the one that told you that.

13:27.729 --> 13:29.389
Oh, yeah.

13:33.151 --> 13:34.895
Hey, Ronnie.

13:35.028 --> 13:37.187
Do you know what the intaglio script is?

13:37.322 --> 13:39.730
The engraving on Ben Franklin's collar?

13:42.577 --> 13:44.369
I don't see it on this bill.

13:44.496 --> 13:46.204
Do you?

13:49.668 --> 13:52.585
Everyone I sleep with dies.

13:54.589 --> 13:55.752
Excuse me?

13:56.925 --> 13:59.879
I slept with this sailor once, when I was 14.

14:00.012 --> 14:02.004
He died overseas somewhere.

14:02.139 --> 14:05.590
What was your relationship to Vincent Avery?

14:06.768 --> 14:09.603
There was no relationship. I barely knew him.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.888
You knew him enough to fly to Baja with him.

14:12.024 --> 14:14.100
He invited me for the weekend.

14:14.234 --> 14:16.191
I figured as long as he didn't chop me up,

14:16.320 --> 14:18.193
I'd have some fun.

14:18.322 --> 14:20.065
Mind if I smoke?

14:22.326 --> 14:24.733
- Yeah.
- Plain sight.

14:30.417 --> 14:33.122
It's a dummy chip. No casino logo.

14:33.253 --> 14:37.251
Exactly the same kind of chips
Vincent Avery used to scam the casinos.

14:37.382 --> 14:39.754
Before he got shot.

14:39.885 --> 14:42.210
So, you two fly down to Baja,

14:42.346 --> 14:43.804
pose as a married couple,

14:43.931 --> 14:45.888
bring back a stomach-load of blow,

14:46.016 --> 14:48.009
and then you run chip scams?

14:48.143 --> 14:50.100
Who's taking your drug profits?

14:50.228 --> 14:52.933
Man, I wish I knew what you were talking about.

14:53.065 --> 14:56.599
- Someone catch you two working on the side?
- I wasn't even there.

14:56.735 --> 14:58.229
- Where were you?
- Home.

14:58.362 --> 15:01.398
- In the bathroom.
- She was passing pellets of cocaine.

15:01.531 --> 15:02.942
I'm outta here.

15:05.369 --> 15:07.326
Sit down!

15:14.378 --> 15:16.169
Thank you.

15:16.296 --> 15:18.966
With your permission,
we need to take some X-rays.

15:19.049 --> 15:21.255
So long as you're the one doing them.

15:21.385 --> 15:22.962
We'd also like to look at your car.

15:23.095 --> 15:26.131
- I lent it to my boyfriend.
- What is his name?

15:26.265 --> 15:30.132
You know, you have
this whole Lenny Kravitz thing going on.

15:31.895 --> 15:35.098
- I'm not one for brothers, but... damn!
- His name.

15:37.818 --> 15:40.190
Keith Driscoll.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.523
- Now you tell me to get involved.
- Evidence against her isn't good.

15:43.657 --> 15:46.326
Hey, listen. Nothing places her at the murder.

15:46.451 --> 15:49.618
She mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead
ten hours later?

15:49.746 --> 15:51.620
A BS chip scam? A lousy alibi?

15:51.748 --> 15:56.291
Vega's on it. He'll find your boyfriend.
If I know my daughter, that's your shooter.

15:56.420 --> 15:59.539
Brass, it's a big city.

15:59.673 --> 16:01.666
Boyfriend could disappear.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.505
But, hey, it's your kid.

16:10.267 --> 16:12.639
Left scope is a government-issued $100 bill.

16:12.769 --> 16:15.095
Right scope is the money from your tourists.

16:15.230 --> 16:17.353
It confirms what you saw with the naked eye.

16:17.482 --> 16:22.690
On a genuine bill "The United States Of
America" is written in micro-letters on the border

16:22.821 --> 16:24.446
of Ben Franklin's portrait.

16:24.573 --> 16:27.989
On the Ortons' bill,
the intaglio script is blurred out.

16:29.161 --> 16:32.696
Microprinting. A trick the Treasury
uses to thwart photocopying a US bill.

16:32.831 --> 16:38.869
What about pigmentation? Treasury seals
and serial numbers... are the same colour, right?

16:39.004 --> 16:41.756
They are on the bill on your left.

16:41.882 --> 16:45.880
So the numbers on the right
didn't hold the green ink

16:46.011 --> 16:48.169
No printer on the market can make a true green.

16:48.305 --> 16:50.381
Blue and yellow hues always bleed in.

16:50.515 --> 16:52.342
Our monetary system depends on it.

16:53.852 --> 16:55.845
Who do we notify? The Treasury?

16:55.979 --> 16:58.684
Secret Service Branch.
They have a field office in Vegas.

16:58.815 --> 17:00.891
I'll put these back in the evidence room.

17:02.861 --> 17:07.856
Wait till the Ortons find out
what we do with counterfeit money.

17:19.044 --> 17:21.582
Nothing.

17:21.713 --> 17:23.255
Told you I was clean.

17:23.382 --> 17:25.623
So, you gave up your drugs to your boss, huh?

17:25.759 --> 17:26.874
Boss?

17:27.010 --> 17:30.177
Do you realise,
every time you ingest one of those pellets,

17:30.305 --> 17:31.883
you risk dying of an overdose?

17:32.015 --> 17:36.761
Only if I eat.
Releases gastric acids. Blah, blah, blah.

17:36.895 --> 17:38.389
So, you can just not eat.

17:38.522 --> 17:42.436
You see, the thing with me is,
I'm... mind over matter.

17:44.194 --> 17:47.563
I can imagine a hamburger and... I'm full.

17:51.159 --> 17:53.152
Will you fill me up, Warrick?

17:58.750 --> 18:00.743
I don't think I can handle this.

18:00.877 --> 18:03.665
- I gotta call Grissom.
- Then call him.

18:03.797 --> 18:05.955
But?

18:06.091 --> 18:09.009
- I didn't say anything.
- I heard it, bro, a "but" in there.

18:09.136 --> 18:12.386
You know how Grissom is.
If you ask him for the keys to the car,

18:12.514 --> 18:14.922
he's gonna ask you
if you've done your homework.

18:15.058 --> 18:17.300
Yeah. That's what I was thinking.

18:17.436 --> 18:21.350
It's like a multiple-choice question. You know?
You go with your first choice.

18:21.481 --> 18:23.688
- Sack up.
- Sack up.

18:32.576 --> 18:34.568
(Cellphone rings)

18:38.957 --> 18:40.950
So did Warrick tell you to call me?

18:41.084 --> 18:43.041
You think you're my only friend in the PD?

18:43.170 --> 18:45.328
I'm just telling you to be careful.

18:45.464 --> 18:47.789
Am I supposed to hold my breath
and count to ten?

18:47.925 --> 18:51.839
Hey, look. We all get a little crazy
when our kids are involved.

18:51.970 --> 18:54.675
Look, I'm on the job. It's standard police work.

18:54.806 --> 18:57.013
Enjoy Reno. I got this.

18:57.142 --> 18:59.715
OK. Hey, but listen, if you find the boyfriend,

18:59.853 --> 19:01.312
don't go it alone

19:04.316 --> 19:05.976
Don't worry, I won't.

19:07.319 --> 19:08.979
Dispatch. Navaho 4-1-9-T.

19:09.446 --> 19:13.230
In pursuit of a 'T8 red Camaro.
Suspect wanted for questioning.

19:16.954 --> 19:19.527
(Tyres screech)

19:20.207 --> 19:22.199
(Car horn blares)

19:42.229 --> 19:43.889
Which one's Keith Driscoll?

19:44.022 --> 19:47.023
I was just hitchhiking.
I told the guy to let me out.

19:47.150 --> 19:49.024
Get lost.

19:50.237 --> 19:51.945
OK come on! Out!

19:52.072 --> 19:55.073
- Easy, man!
- I'm only gonna ask you once.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.572
- What are you and Ellie into?
- What do you mean?

19:57.703 --> 20:01.072
You got her muling drugs from Mexico.
You got her mixed up in a homicide.

20:01.206 --> 20:05.074
You got it backwards, man.
She turned me on to coke so I could stud for her.

20:07.421 --> 20:08.963
You can't just shoot me, man.

20:09.089 --> 20:10.916
(Sirens)

20:17.180 --> 20:18.758
Brass.

20:18.890 --> 20:20.433
Yo, Jim.

20:20.559 --> 20:22.635
- We got it.
- Everything's cool.

20:22.769 --> 20:25.723
This guy was gonna kill me, man.
He pulled his gun.

20:25.856 --> 20:28.263
I'm sure the officer felt
his life was in danger, sir.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.152
We wanna question you
about the murder of Vincent Avery.

20:31.278 --> 20:34.943
- I'm not riding with him.
- You're right, you're not.

20:51.715 --> 20:55.298
What do you mean, you can't give it back?
It's all we have for our vacation.

20:55.427 --> 20:58.878
Well, it's counterfeit.
We have to take it out of circulation.

20:59.014 --> 21:00.888
What?

21:02.059 --> 21:05.843
Mr Orton, you don't look so surprised.

21:05.979 --> 21:07.308
Matt? Honey?

21:07.439 --> 21:11.022
I went to the gas station. The attendant said
the hundred I had was phoney.

21:11.151 --> 21:13.476
So I went to our branch bank here

21:13.612 --> 21:16.317
and I tried to exchange it,
but they couldn't do it.

21:16.448 --> 21:20.909
I mean, why would anybody turn in bad money
if they can't get reimbursed for it?

21:21.036 --> 21:24.203
Because it's in violation of Title 18, Section 4T3

21:24.331 --> 21:26.074
of the United States Code,

21:26.208 --> 21:29.873
punishable by up to 15 years
for knowingly passing on bad money.

21:30.003 --> 21:33.503
- Oh, my God!
- I just didn't wanna get stuck holding the bag.

21:33.632 --> 21:35.007
Do you have a $20 bill?

21:36.176 --> 21:37.754
Our wallets are up in the room.

21:37.886 --> 21:39.428
I may have something.

21:40.681 --> 21:42.590
Hm. You see the ghost?

21:43.892 --> 21:46.597
Right there on the right.

21:46.728 --> 21:50.180
- Oh, yeah.
- They're embedded to prevent forgeries.

21:50.315 --> 21:54.693
You should see Lincoln on the five.
He looks really stressed out.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.729
I wish I had met you last week.

21:56.863 --> 22:02.450
A special agent from Secret Service wants to
talk to you about the final deposition of this case.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.502
Warrick Brown?

22:11.628 --> 22:13.787
Special Agent Beckman, Treasury Department.

22:13.922 --> 22:15.547
Treasury Department?

22:15.674 --> 22:19.007
We wanted to be sure CSI's on the same page
on this counterfeit case.

22:19.136 --> 22:22.220
- Counterfeit?
- Our lab wants to analyse that money too.

22:22.347 --> 22:25.052
- What money?
- I didn't wanna interrupt you.

22:25.183 --> 22:27.853
- On a federal case.
- Agent Beckman,

22:27.936 --> 22:30.510
I'm Sara Sidle
Could you excuse us for a minute?

22:32.899 --> 22:38.142
Warrick, you gotta turn on your pager, man.
I got Brass's daughter's car in the garage.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.447
- I'm dealing with something.
- That's why I didn't bring this to you.

22:41.575 --> 22:45.026
Vega says we won't be able to hold the suspect
for more than a half-hour.

22:45.162 --> 22:46.905
Did Sidle hold back information?

22:47.039 --> 22:49.031
I didn't not tell him.

22:49.166 --> 22:52.499
- I ran with the case. I do it with Grissom.
- Well, I'm not Grissom!

22:53.712 --> 22:55.918
Guys.

22:56.882 --> 22:59.040
I didn't say it.

23:01.470 --> 23:07.259
Sara, brief Special Agent Beckman
on the funny money. Nick, garage.

23:12.105 --> 23:14.643
<i>THE CHAMBERS BROTHERS:</i>

23:16.443 --> 23:18.436
<i>Young hearts can go that way</i>

23:20.405 --> 23:23.406

23:24.534 --> 23:27.204
<i>I don't care what others say</i>

23:28.246 --> 23:30.654
<i>They say we don't listen anyway</i>

23:30.791 --> 23:32.997

23:41.969 --> 23:46.097
<i>Oh, the rules have changed today</i>

23:47.307 --> 23:49.596

23:50.602 --> 23:51.717

23:51.853 --> 23:54.060

24:20.257 --> 24:21.716
Tyre plug.

24:21.842 --> 24:23.502
That's a nail in sheep's clothing.

24:26.096 --> 24:28.468
Treads from the crime scene.

24:28.599 --> 24:33.426
The void on the one-to-one
matches the void on Ellie's left rear tyre.

24:33.562 --> 24:35.601
Siamese twins.

24:35.731 --> 24:39.396
Proves one thing.
This was the getaway car used in the murder.

24:39.526 --> 24:40.937
Yeah.

24:42.571 --> 24:45.441
We printed the vehicle
your client was found driving.

24:45.574 --> 24:48.943
It puts the car at the scene of Avery's murder
less than 12 hours ago.

24:49.077 --> 24:52.696
Come off it. The car's not even registered to him.

24:52.831 --> 24:54.788
No. The girl he bought tickets to Baja for.

24:54.916 --> 24:56.576
He bought tickets for Avery as well.

24:56.710 --> 25:01.668
The tickets were bought with your credit card,
but we have no proof he ever went down there.

25:01.798 --> 25:03.756
- He's generous
- Till Avery made him mad.

25:03.884 --> 25:07.300
You wanna talk about the gun
your captain pulled on my client?

25:07.429 --> 25:11.047
An unarmed man.
That's got PD brutality written all over it.

25:11.183 --> 25:12.807
Vega?

25:12.935 --> 25:15.426
Safety precaution only.

25:18.023 --> 25:20.596
- We're done.
- Let's go.

25:28.158 --> 25:30.945
You suspect them
of a high-end counterfeit operation?

25:31.078 --> 25:33.829
No, but it did get me thinking.

25:33.956 --> 25:36.447
If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.

25:36.583 --> 25:39.501
Take a look. This is the money
that we got from the con man.

25:39.628 --> 25:42.582
See the serial numbers?
Each one is different.

25:48.345 --> 25:51.630
- Just like real money.
- That's what threw Ronnie and I off the scent.

25:51.765 --> 25:55.977
This couple didn't make one bill and run
100 copies with the same serial number.

26:02.776 --> 26:05.101
They had to burn separate plates
for each number.

26:10.409 --> 26:12.401
Much harder to catch.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.911
The very high end.

26:15.038 --> 26:17.078
The Duffys are major counterfeiters.

26:17.207 --> 26:19.200
You mean the Ortons.

26:19.334 --> 26:22.869
My investigators tell me they're the Duffys
from Las Vegas County.

26:23.005 --> 26:24.415
Orton's their assumed names.

26:24.548 --> 26:26.291
How long have you known that?

26:26.425 --> 26:28.631
I went on the T-Department database.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.592
They've each done time for fraud.
And, yes, high-end counterfeiting.

26:32.723 --> 26:35.759
- You federal guys are sneaky.
- Access.

26:35.892 --> 26:38.051
So, what do you wanna do with the money?

26:38.186 --> 26:41.852
It's your money now. Well, the Treasury's.

26:43.650 --> 26:45.643
Thanks. I'll take it from here.

26:45.777 --> 26:48.066
Find the operation and shut it down.

26:48.196 --> 26:50.154
Hey!

26:51.241 --> 26:54.076
- I'm still part of this.
- Not really.

26:54.202 --> 26:57.073
But you're making me look good,
so if you wanna tag along...

26:57.205 --> 27:00.076
- I don't tag along.
- Suit yourself.

27:07.007 --> 27:09.332
We got bad news from the garage

27:10.510 --> 27:12.005
Give it to me.

27:12.137 --> 27:15.091
The tyre evidence
puts Ellie's car at the murder scene.

27:15.223 --> 27:19.221
- We'll be pressing charges for Avery's murder.
- Come on. You know she didn't kill him.

27:19.353 --> 27:22.722
- Keith Driscoll did.
- Maybe so, but we don't have Driscoll.

27:22.856 --> 27:26.225
- What?
- Vega had to let him go after your gun episode.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.396
Oh, I get it.
Vega thinks she'll eventually rat out Driscoll.

27:29.529 --> 27:34.654
- That's what you cops think.
- Let me tell you something about my daughter.

27:34.785 --> 27:36.113
Never happen.

27:51.009 --> 27:53.761
- Are they arresting me?
- I'm gonna bail you out.

27:55.055 --> 27:56.846
You can stay at my place.

27:56.974 --> 27:58.349
I have a place.

27:58.475 --> 28:00.053
You have a place?

28:00.185 --> 28:03.684
Keith and I do. We share everything.

28:09.444 --> 28:13.774
Ellie, why do you do this to yourself?
You're better than that.

28:13.907 --> 28:15.900
You're better than him.

28:16.034 --> 28:18.193
No, I'm not.

28:32.926 --> 28:34.919
(Phone rings)

28:43.812 --> 28:47.015
Grissom's office. CSI. Warrick speaking.

28:47.149 --> 28:49.818
Warrick it's Vega I got a 444

28:49.901 --> 28:52.855
Officer involved shooting? Who?

28:52.988 --> 28:54.981
One guess

29:28.148 --> 29:30.390
You've just bounced off the glass ceiling.

29:30.525 --> 29:32.185
Excuse me?

29:32.319 --> 29:37.028
Brass buys his daughter a get-out-of-jail-free
card and her boyfriend ends up on a gurney.

29:37.157 --> 29:40.858
Ecklie, you're Day shift,
and you're here because...?

29:40.994 --> 29:43.664
- I'm dedicated.
- Yeah. Picture that.

29:47.459 --> 29:49.617
- What happened?
- Driscoll shot in the throat.

29:49.753 --> 29:54.748
First officer here found Brass in the apartment,
woozy. Keith Driscoll on the floor, lights out.

29:54.883 --> 29:58.715
- Where's his daughter?
- No-one knows. I got guys looking for her.

29:58.845 --> 30:01.336
- Check his weapon?
- Waiting on you guys.

30:24.663 --> 30:26.656
There's one round missing.

30:37.009 --> 30:39.678
It's just you and me talking now, Jim.

30:39.761 --> 30:41.505
Off the record

30:41.638 --> 30:44.212
You went to the apartment?

30:44.349 --> 30:45.725
Yeah.

30:45.851 --> 30:48.223
- You notify Dispatch?
- It was a personal visit.

30:48.353 --> 30:51.936
- But you went looking for Keith Driscoll.
- No.

30:52.065 --> 30:54.058
I went looking for Ellie.

30:56.153 --> 30:57.528
Where is she?

30:58.697 --> 31:01.698
- Where is she?
- She's not here. Hey, you got a warrant?

31:05.412 --> 31:07.701
Everything's a blur after that.

31:07.831 --> 31:09.824
Do you remember drawing your gun?

31:09.958 --> 31:12.034
No.

31:12.169 --> 31:14.838
You're leaving something out.

31:16.715 --> 31:19.206
Hey, you got a warrant?

31:20.510 --> 31:22.717
Ellie, are you here?

31:23.430 --> 31:26.217
- I'm not leaving anything out.
- Your daughter lives there.

31:26.350 --> 31:30.264
She probably saw what happened.
We're gonna pick her up eventually.

31:31.813 --> 31:33.806
Careful. She spits.

31:39.154 --> 31:40.897
One shot?

31:41.031 --> 31:44.115
15 bullets left in Brass's gun.
There should be 16.

31:44.242 --> 31:47.777
What cop doesn't empty his magazine?
They're trained to shoot to kill.

31:59.341 --> 32:01.084
Hey!

32:03.345 --> 32:05.753
Look where I just located this blood.

32:05.889 --> 32:09.969
- The back of the grip.
- Novices get their hands pinched in the slide.

32:11.895 --> 32:13.093
Slide bite

32:14.273 --> 32:16.265
Man.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.558
Brass didn't shoot this guy.

32:18.694 --> 32:20.686
I need you to show me your hands.

32:20.821 --> 32:24.190
You're testing for gunshot residue?
It's a little late for that.

32:24.324 --> 32:25.984
Your hands, Captain.

32:31.540 --> 32:33.331
Satisfied?

32:33.458 --> 32:35.498
I'm gonna need to take your badge.

32:35.627 --> 32:38.297
It's not your job to take my stripes.

32:38.380 --> 32:40.586
In this case, it is.

32:40.716 --> 32:44.001
- Detective Vega.
- No.

32:57.816 --> 33:01.980
AB Dick 4910. 11 x 14 offsets.

33:02.112 --> 33:06.441
This is the Rolls-Royce of printers.
The closest thing to what the government uses.

33:06.575 --> 33:08.567
Multiple ink s.

33:08.702 --> 33:11.193
Disaperf computer paper.

33:11.330 --> 33:14.200
Heavy rag. 25% content. Makes for durability.

33:14.333 --> 33:17.287
Mr Duffy, can Agent Beckman and I
see your burn plates, please?

33:31.266 --> 33:33.389
Press, ink, paper, burn plates.

33:34.353 --> 33:36.179
Only question now is

33:36.313 --> 33:38.306
where's the money...

33:40.359 --> 33:42.351
...Mr and Mrs Duffy?

33:44.154 --> 33:45.862
There isn't any.

33:45.989 --> 33:50.651
Oh, come on. You can print a million dollars
a day with this operation. Where is it?

33:50.786 --> 33:53.074
- There is no money.
- Excuse me?

33:55.791 --> 33:57.618
I don't get this. Beckman...

33:57.751 --> 33:59.542
Congratulations, Sidle.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.995
- You passed.
- Passed?

34:02.130 --> 34:04.704
Duffy is their code alias.

34:04.841 --> 34:09.835
This is Special Agent Conners,
Special Agent Tessari. We're all with Service.

34:09.972 --> 34:13.257
- I don't...
- We put bait money in the hands of bad people.

34:13.391 --> 34:15.550
In this case, a reputed con.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.437
To see how the money
leads to law enforcement.

34:18.563 --> 34:22.431
- What if Vincent Avery wasn't murdered?
Murder wasn't on the agenda

34:22.567 --> 34:26.435
However, in light of unpredictable events,
the sting still upheld.

34:26.571 --> 34:30.023
It came to you and you didn't take.
You should be very proud.

34:30.158 --> 34:32.828
Wow. I don't feel that at all.

34:32.911 --> 34:34.904
It never feels right when it work s.

34:35.038 --> 34:37.708
Only feels wrong when it doesn't.

34:37.833 --> 34:41.331
First, I have the saliva sample
taken from Captain Brass's badge.

34:41.460 --> 34:43.454
Better known as Ellie's DNA.

34:43.588 --> 34:45.581
Take a good look at her markers.

34:45.716 --> 34:48.717
Second, blood sample from Jim Brass.

34:48.844 --> 34:51.251
They're nothing alike.

34:51.388 --> 34:55.172
From parent to child, seven of thirteen markers
should match up. Minimum.

34:55.309 --> 34:57.764
In this case,
there's not one marker in common.

34:57.894 --> 35:00.101
I don't have Ellie's mother's DNA on file,

35:00.230 --> 35:02.437
- but my guess is...
- Was she adopted?

35:06.236 --> 35:07.778
Whew!

35:07.904 --> 35:09.897
What about the blood on Brass's gun?

35:10.032 --> 35:12.024
Not Brass's. Not Ellie's.

35:12.159 --> 35:13.653
Not Ellie's?

35:13.785 --> 35:15.861
No, or her boyfriend Keith Driscoll.

35:16.997 --> 35:18.954
You still got a shooter out there.

35:19.082 --> 35:21.158
With a pinch on his hand.

35:22.753 --> 35:25.504
All right. Where's that manifest?

35:30.552 --> 35:32.545
Vincent Avery.

35:35.349 --> 35:37.306
2034.

35:41.104 --> 35:42.647
2034.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.112
Marty Gilmore.

35:58.330 --> 36:00.655
(Siren)

36:02.501 --> 36:04.374
Hold it, hold it.

36:06.296 --> 36:08.040
The game's over, Marty.

36:08.966 --> 36:10.875
The hitchhiker.

36:11.009 --> 36:13.880
- You know this guy?
- Yean we met

36:14.012 --> 36:16.135
When the three of you got back from Baja.

36:16.265 --> 36:17.807
You conned the Captain.

36:19.643 --> 36:21.968
I gotta shake your hand.

36:22.104 --> 36:24.180
- This a joke?
- No, on the real.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.403
You shot Driscoll.

36:35.701 --> 36:38.536
- With his firearm.
- That was you in the other room.

36:40.706 --> 36:42.615
I think I killed him.

36:42.749 --> 36:45.419
- Nope. He killed you.
(Gunshot)

36:46.837 --> 36:48.414
Urgh!

36:54.636 --> 36:58.551
So, you offed Driscoll to take over his drug op.

36:58.682 --> 37:00.390
What about Ellie?

37:01.476 --> 37:05.521
She's supposed to be in jail
for shooting Avery at the casino.

37:07.399 --> 37:08.941
- Urgh!
- You eat something?

37:09.067 --> 37:11.060
I took a laxative.

37:11.194 --> 37:14.445
Oh, God. He's gonna OD.

37:14.573 --> 37:15.901
Can we get a medic?

37:17.534 --> 37:19.408
Can we get a medic?

37:21.079 --> 37:22.028
Brass!

37:24.416 --> 37:25.958
Yeah.

37:26.084 --> 37:28.540
I need Rescue

37:29.921 --> 37:33.622
826 Herrick Lane. Overdose.
Send an ambulance.

37:33.759 --> 37:35.419
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.

37:35.552 --> 37:39.336
No, worse. You're gonna live.

37:48.815 --> 37:51.651
Brass! Hang on.

37:56.990 --> 37:59.279
I only took it to get Ellie's DNA off of it.

37:59.409 --> 38:00.987
That's it.

38:02.079 --> 38:04.071
A man's gotta do...

38:06.541 --> 38:08.451
What is it, Rick?

38:09.628 --> 38:12.119
We were checking out the blood from your gun.

38:12.255 --> 38:16.004
- We compared your DNA to her DNA.
- Yeah?

38:16.134 --> 38:19.338
You never said anything
about her being adopted.

38:25.644 --> 38:27.268
She's not.

38:28.772 --> 38:30.515
Call it the mailman.

38:33.527 --> 38:35.519
Ellie doesn't know.

38:56.258 --> 38:57.717
Ellie?

39:01.930 --> 39:04.172
How did you find me?

39:04.308 --> 39:06.881
I'm a detective.

39:09.605 --> 39:12.855
I heard you never went back
to Driscoll's apartment that night.

39:12.983 --> 39:15.474
It's true.

39:15.611 --> 39:18.362
I could have sworn
I heard you in that other room.

39:18.488 --> 39:20.481
No, Dad.

39:20.616 --> 39:23.866
I was never there. Never.

39:24.995 --> 39:27.830
I guess I've been doing that
since you've been born.

39:27.956 --> 39:31.159
I mean, I know I was never around, but...

39:33.670 --> 39:35.663
You know, no matter where I am...

39:38.717 --> 39:40.710
...no matter what I'm doing...

39:44.848 --> 39:47.421
...I always think that you're there.

39:47.559 --> 39:49.552
Even if you're not.

39:51.063 --> 39:53.898
Come back to me, Ellie.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.362
Dad...

40:00.489 --> 40:02.481
it's way too late.

40:08.288 --> 40:10.281
I've got to catch a flight to Jersey.

40:10.415 --> 40:12.408
Midnight.

40:12.542 --> 40:14.500
Mom says...

40:14.628 --> 40:16.620
I can stay with her... a while.

40:16.755 --> 40:19.293
Sure. OK.

40:19.424 --> 40:22.710
You need a ride to the airport?
I can get you there fast.

40:22.844 --> 40:24.636
Thanks.

40:24.763 --> 40:26.756
I'm taking the shuttle, so...

40:26.890 --> 40:28.883
Oh, yeah. Right. OK.

40:35.857 --> 40:37.316
Catch you later.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.153
- Hey, Sara.
- Hey.

40:49.288 --> 40:50.948
Hey.

40:51.081 --> 40:53.489
I'm short on cash.
Can you loan me a hundred?

40:53.625 --> 40:55.618
Funny. Very funny.

40:55.752 --> 40:57.745
Oh! Look, shift's over.

40:57.879 --> 40:59.872
Guess you're one of us again.

41:08.932 --> 41:10.925
Hey Griss!

41:11.059 --> 41:13.846
- How did it go?
- The seminar was fine.

41:13.979 --> 41:17.348
Every one of my roaches got stage fright.

41:17.482 --> 41:19.689
They came in fourth, third, second...

41:19.818 --> 41:21.811
and dead last.

41:21.945 --> 41:23.772
How about you? How did you do?

41:23.905 --> 41:27.689
Well, the job is fine.
It's the other stuff, the personalities.

41:27.826 --> 41:30.531
I love mankind, it's people I can't stand?

41:30.662 --> 41:32.655
- Who's that? Einstein?
- Linus.

41:32.789 --> 41:34.497
Charlie Brown. Figures.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.368
Is that why you put me in charge?

41:36.501 --> 41:38.541
You think I like dealing with people?

41:38.670 --> 41:40.995
Remember you asked me
what I was in high school?

41:41.131 --> 41:42.625
Yeah. You said "a ghost".

41:42.758 --> 41:46.127
When I leave CSI, there won't be cake
in the break room. I'll be gone.

41:46.261 --> 41:49.132
So I wanted to see if you could step in.

41:49.264 --> 41:51.387
Tell me

41:51.516 --> 41:53.972
All of it. From the top.

41:54.102 --> 41:55.727
From the top?

42:03.278 --> 42:05.271
I don't know where to start.

42:05.405 --> 42:07.398
It was wild.
