Jane Foster's
gotta go to work.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.802
[both grunt]

13:25.504 --> 13:28.873
[yells, grunts]

13:31.010 --> 13:33.344
[yells]

13:35.715 --> 13:37.982
You certainly know
how to make an entrance.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.284
Stop.
You're embarrassing me.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.521
Actually, do not stop.
We need that Bifrost running.

13:52.431 --> 13:53.998
[whoosh]

13:58.237 --> 14:00.338
I dig your new suit.
It just screams,

14:00.373 --> 14:02.506
"I'm the Beyonder,
and I'm overcompensating."

14:02.541 --> 14:05.209
You think you're special.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.678
But you're not the only one
who can build armor.

14:07.713 --> 14:11.082
I'm not the only one.
I'm just the best.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.760
[grunts]
[Beyonder] No more tricks,
no more running.

14:22.795 --> 14:26.497
You want to destroy
my experiment?
Then I will see you destroyed.

14:26.532 --> 14:31.903
Your world, your friends,
everything you love-- destroyed.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.544
[growls]

14:44.283 --> 14:46.284
[laughs]

14:56.295 --> 14:59.363
What, no jokey banter?

14:59.398 --> 15:00.865
Good!
[grunting]

15:02.501 --> 15:03.935
[yelling]

15:03.970 --> 15:05.436
[alarm beeping]

15:09.809 --> 15:12.476
Your tech is dull,
without edge.

15:12.511 --> 15:16.514
My tech... has bite.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.485
Your tech bites.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.626
[cries out]

15:34.266 --> 15:37.935
Aw. You seem to have
taken on a little damage.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.737
I'll make it more.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.640
I've got one trick
left up my sleeve.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.211
Huh?

15:48.814 --> 15:50.581
What is this?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.650
Just a little something
I cooked up.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.254
Aah!
[groans]

15:57.289 --> 15:59.824
My systems... disrupted.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.625
But how?

16:01.660 --> 16:03.627
Old-school computer virus.

16:03.662 --> 16:06.664
From info I hacked
from your Citadel.
[grunts]

16:09.135 --> 16:11.469
[pants]
[electricity arcing]

16:11.504 --> 16:15.473
I always win, Stark.
If you'd done what I told you,

16:15.508 --> 16:17.642
Battleworld could've
been your triumph.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.479
[grunts]

16:21.514 --> 16:23.647
Breaking news alert:

16:23.682 --> 16:26.650
Battleworld is over.
You didn't win.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.886
[yells]

16:28.921 --> 16:31.522
This energy
won't hold for long!

16:31.557 --> 16:34.992
By the Seven Suns of--
[grunts]

16:35.027 --> 16:36.327
[Ghost Rider yells]

16:37.830 --> 16:39.397
Doctor Strange!

16:39.432 --> 16:41.332
Get up!

16:41.367 --> 16:43.534
There isn't much time!

16:44.737 --> 16:47.571
Strange, I cannot
complete this by myself!

16:47.606 --> 16:49.507
It needs your magic!

16:49.542 --> 16:53.644
[grunts weakly]
Can't cast. But you can.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.813
Take this.
[grunts]

16:55.848 --> 16:58.015
[groans]

16:58.050 --> 17:00.952
The Eye of Agamotto.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.028
By the Seven Suns
of Cinnibus,

17:11.063 --> 17:13.431
by the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth,

17:13.465 --> 17:17.568
and by the Lights
of the All-Seeing Eye
of Agomotto!

17:24.577 --> 17:26.844
Aahh!

17:26.878 --> 17:30.214
You did it.
Now we need the spark.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.949
[roars]

17:34.487 --> 17:37.521
I'm back,
and I feel like smashing!

17:37.556 --> 17:39.724
[yelling]
[growling]

17:44.897 --> 17:47.465
[yells]

17:47.500 --> 17:48.933
[grunts]

17:48.968 --> 17:51.068
[grunts]

17:51.103 --> 17:53.070
Loki...

17:53.105 --> 17:55.940
you appreciate
and understand power.

17:55.975 --> 17:59.643
Join me, and help me
crush the Avengers.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.947
Have you not
been paying attention?

18:02.982 --> 18:05.416
I suppose it's not
your fault for asking.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.818
But let me connect
the dots for you

18:07.853 --> 18:11.655
in a way your simple brain
can understand.

18:11.690 --> 18:15.226
I am an Avenger!

18:15.261 --> 18:16.393
[yells]

18:16.428 --> 18:18.562
[grunts]

18:18.597 --> 18:22.467
Nice job, Loki.
I'll take it from here.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.678
Thor, the Bifrost
needs your lightning!

18:34.713 --> 18:36.280
Hurry!

18:38.651 --> 18:41.018
Could've fallen in line,

18:41.053 --> 18:43.854
but you persisted
in defying me!

18:43.889 --> 18:47.191
[Avengers grunt]

18:47.226 --> 18:48.592
[yells]

18:48.627 --> 18:50.862
[straining]

18:53.132 --> 18:55.866
The lab mice always think
they have a chance.

18:55.901 --> 18:58.435
But they're wrong.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.306
See, I make the rules,
and the cold truth is,

19:02.341 --> 19:04.308
you have no chance.

19:04.343 --> 19:05.843
You never did.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.546
[Jane]
Oh, there's always a chance.
[grunts]

19:13.319 --> 19:14.985
[grunts, groans]

19:15.020 --> 19:16.720
Jane!

19:16.755 --> 19:19.990
Say good-bye, Dr. Foster.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.825
[grunting]

19:21.860 --> 19:23.194
It's quicksand!

19:23.229 --> 19:25.129
[strains, yells]

19:25.164 --> 19:26.897
[laughing]

19:26.932 --> 19:29.633
[grunting]
No!

19:29.668 --> 19:32.837
Thor!
[grunting]

19:34.173 --> 19:35.906
[laughs]

19:35.941 --> 19:38.342
Jane!
[grunts]

19:38.377 --> 19:40.711
Aahhh!
[grunts]

19:40.746 --> 19:43.848
[grunts]
[grunting]

19:44.850 --> 19:45.850
[yells]

20:04.436 --> 20:06.203
The hammer went to Jane!

20:06.238 --> 20:09.740
Nay. Jane took the hammer.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.709
This can't be happening.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.352
You know what they say,
Beyonder.

20:21.387 --> 20:25.423
Whoever is worthy
will possess the power of Thor!

20:26.425 --> 20:28.826
[cries out]

20:29.762 --> 20:33.897
You... bested me.

20:33.932 --> 20:37.234
But my experiment's not done.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.737
Yes, it is.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.840
Curse you, Avengers!

20:44.109 --> 20:47.111
[cries out, echoing]

20:50.816 --> 20:52.716
Asgard.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.753
'Tis restored.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.889
So is Earth,
and everything else.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.791
We did it! We won!

21:00.826 --> 21:03.227
Whoo! Yeah!

21:03.262 --> 21:06.497
[Ant-Man]
Ha-ha-ha! Yeah! All right.

21:07.966 --> 21:10.768
We stomped the Beyonder
and saved the universe.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.803
I don't know about you,
but I need a vacation.

21:12.838 --> 21:16.807
And we could never
have done it without Loki.

21:16.842 --> 21:21.312
Uh, I am surprised as anyone
at how this turned out.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.846
Well done, Loki.

21:22.881 --> 21:26.317
But before we return home,
a little housekeeping.

21:26.352 --> 21:29.720
I need you to return
the Eye of Agamotto to me.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.326
No.
