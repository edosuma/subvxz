* satellite's gone up to the skies *

00:10.630 --> 00:14.830
* things like that
drive me out of my mind *

00:18.400 --> 00:19.990
we've got two cops shot here.

00:20.025 --> 00:21.580
- Severe chest wound. He's hemorrhaging.
- No breath sounds.

00:21.615 --> 00:22.620
If he's got a pneumo,

00:22.655 --> 00:24.020
- he's gonna need a chest tube.
- Put him in trauma three.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.970
it looks like the bullet
grazed his right belly.

00:26.005 --> 00:27.230
Grazed?

00:27.265 --> 00:28.930
I'm losin' blood here by the pintful!

00:29.690 --> 00:31.570
thank you,officers. We need
to prep him for surgery.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.790
Wait,wait,wait!

00:33.825 --> 00:35.770
Wait,where you taking my partner?!

00:35.805 --> 00:38.290
Don't let him die,doc!

00:37.200 --> 00:39.300
{a6}* Satellite  *

00:40.970 --> 00:42.980
that's my partner!

00:44.230 --> 00:45.450
do you hear me?

00:45.485 --> 00:51.430
{a6}* Satellite's gone way up to mars *

00:51.370 --> 00:53.060
jimmy mcmanus. Where is he?

00:53.095 --> 00:55.080
Kiss the pimple on my ass,cop!

00:55.115 --> 00:56.630
Come herE. Come here.

01:00.430 --> 01:01.790
little patrick.

01:01.825 --> 01:03.800
too dumb to open a lollipop.

01:05.050 --> 01:07.270
Too dumb to captain a kickball team,

01:07.305 --> 01:09.670
and too dumb to leave new york

01:09.705 --> 01:10.990
when his boss

01:12.320 --> 01:14.180
plugs two of my men.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.890
I'll ask you again.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.120
Where...

01:17.155 --> 01:18.440
Is...

01:18.475 --> 01:20.530
jimmy mcmanus?

01:21.450 --> 01:23.210
Hey there,florence nightingale,

01:23.245 --> 01:24.320
if this doesn't work out,

01:24.355 --> 01:27.430
maybe you can get yourself
a job slicing haddock

01:27.465 --> 01:29.280
at the fulton fish market.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.170
{a6}* Things like that drive *

01:32.370 --> 01:34.740
Oh,my god. Ray.

01:35.490 --> 01:36.810
it's okay.

01:36.845 --> 01:38.360
It's all right.

01:38.395 --> 01:39.940
Morphine's kicking in.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.060
I called denise. She's on her way.

01:42.095 --> 01:44.390
Yeah,well,I ain't stickin' around.

01:44.425 --> 01:46.000
They're gonna patch me up

01:46.035 --> 01:47.560
and then get me back out there.

01:47.595 --> 01:49.320
I promised a bullet
of mine I'd fix him up

01:49.355 --> 01:52.510
with one of mcmanus' internal organs.

01:52.545 --> 01:53.870
Where's chris?

01:55.500 --> 01:57.100
They gotta operate on him.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.050
He got shot really bad.

02:18.045 --> 02:21.610

wipe that grin off his face.

02:21.645 --> 02:23.580
* Of love *

02:23.615 --> 02:25.660
he's going into shock. We're
gonna have to crack his chest.

02:25.695 --> 02:27.320
- Get him up to O.R. Quick.
- B.P. Is dropping.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.650
He's crashing. Grab the cart.

02:28.685 --> 02:30.480
bring it in! on it's way!

02:33.410 --> 02:34.890
ray!

02:35.180 --> 02:36.510
You here for the fun?

02:36.545 --> 02:38.930
Yeah,I wouldn't miss
it for the world,fiore.

02:38.965 --> 02:41.400
Heard you guys are
going rat turd hunting.

02:41.970 --> 02:43.540
How is he now?

02:44.240 --> 02:45.310
He's hangin' in...

02:45.345 --> 02:47.100
like gunga din.

02:47.135 --> 02:49.720
- Let's go.
- Why not?

02:50.710 --> 02:52.350
clear!

02:52.780 --> 02:54.120
I need an amp of epi.

02:54.155 --> 02:55.390
Come on,chris. Fight,damn it!

02:55.425 --> 02:57.740
- still no pulse.
- Jack it up to 300.

02:57.775 --> 03:00.080
Clear!

03:02.670 --> 03:05.260
- nothing.
- 360

03:05.295 --> 03:06.560
Clear!

03:07.680 --> 03:08.830
either your lips start moving,

03:08.865 --> 03:10.960
or you keep kissing miss plymouth.

03:14.130 --> 03:15.360
mcmanus isn't here,boss.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.390
Ain't been here since
yesterday,at least.

03:23.470 --> 03:27.410
way to go,chris. Way
to go. Stay with us,kid.

03:35.770 --> 03:39.150
this guy's gone to ground
like nobody's business.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.630
We'll find him.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.520
To chris pulling through.

03:46.220 --> 03:47.400
And coming home.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.910
And to jimmy mcmanus
getting measured for a casket

03:49.945 --> 03:53.540
at fitzgerald's funeral
home sooner than later.

04:04.700 --> 04:09.250
Dear god,I need your help.

04:11.110 --> 04:13.920
My friends need your help right now,too.

04:15.680 --> 04:21.870
Please send your angels to protect
my friend chris and heal his wounds...

04:22.910 --> 04:26.390
protect gene from the
burden of responsibility

04:26.425 --> 04:28.890
I know he feels for all of us.

04:29.460 --> 04:33.700
Shelter ray from the guilt
he carries on his shoulders

04:33.735 --> 04:36.050
for what happened to chris.

04:36.085 --> 04:38.350
And watch over sam.

04:38.385 --> 04:41.450
Help him find his truth...

04:43.140 --> 04:48.550
wherever or whatever it may be.

05:02.940 --> 05:05.520
2-b! Just the man I was looking for.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.090
What are you doing right now?

05:07.125 --> 05:09.010
I am unlocking the door.

05:09.045 --> 05:11.700
Then I am going through
the door and going to bed.

05:11.735 --> 05:13.280
No! You can't do that.

05:13.315 --> 05:14.400
- I can't?
- No.

05:14.435 --> 05:16.660
I'm locked out of my apartment.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.080
Oh,wow. I'm really tired.

05:21.115 --> 05:23.290
But,2-b,I'm wide awake,

05:23.325 --> 05:26.090
and you look like you need
a good game of checkers.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.470
No,but I know why you're confused.

05:27.505 --> 05:30.370
'Cause my "good game of checkers"
look is very similar to my,

05:30.405 --> 05:33.640
uh,"I'm utterly exhausted" look.

05:33.675 --> 05:35.050
See?

05:35.360 --> 05:36.940
Checkers and a beer.

05:36.975 --> 05:38.940
It's the best way to end the day...

05:38.975 --> 05:40.730
or greet the morning.

05:52.460 --> 05:55.300
fold thy wings around me
and guard me with love.

05:55.335 --> 05:58.500
Softly sing songs to
me from heaven above.

05:58.535 --> 06:02.180
Dear god,make them strong.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.970
Help them resist the vengeance
they feel in their hearts.

06:06.005 --> 06:07.680
You got me,copper.

06:08.180 --> 06:10.120
Okay. Okay.

06:10.155 --> 06:11.170
But I got a mouthpiece.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.000
So I'm gonna be out
by happy time tomorrow.

06:13.035 --> 06:14.030
Trust me on that.

06:16.150 --> 06:18.830
and forgive our enemies
for what they do.

06:18.865 --> 06:20.450
In your name we pray.

06:21.030 --> 06:22.530
Amen.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.730
my name is sam tyler.

06:32.765 --> 06:36.250
I was in an accident,and
I woke up in 1973.

06:36.285 --> 06:38.330
I don't know how or why I'm here,

06:38.365 --> 06:39.710
but whatever's happened,

06:39.745 --> 06:42.010
it's like I've landed
on a different planet.

06:42.045 --> 06:44.240
Now maybe if I can work out the reason,

06:44.275 --> 06:46.340
I can get home.

06:56.070 --> 06:58.580
mcmanus was armed,but he didn't pull it.

06:58.615 --> 07:01.600
These casings are from a .380,ray.

07:01.635 --> 07:05.760
that kind of gun doesn't pack the
wallop your average street thug prefers.

07:05.795 --> 07:08.150
What's a 5-letter word
for "humorous brilliance"?

07:08.185 --> 07:10.130
You plan on working some time today?

07:10.165 --> 07:11.200
"Witty.

07:11.235 --> 07:13.730
" You know,whether mcmanus
had it coming or not,

07:13.765 --> 07:15.260
we still have to work the case,right?

07:15.295 --> 07:19.660
The only reason I might possibly want
to find that killer is to shake his hand,

07:19.695 --> 07:23.720
buy him a cream soda and
introduce him to my cousin millie,

07:23.755 --> 07:25.150
who has beautiful breasts.

07:25.185 --> 07:26.900
Can we be serious here
for a minute,please?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.460
Somewhere an angel's just got his wings.

07:33.350 --> 07:35.310
give me the particulars thus far.

07:35.345 --> 07:39.940
Well,judging from the position of the
body and the location of the casings,

07:39.975 --> 07:43.720
I'd guess the shooter stood about here.

07:43.755 --> 07:47.810
Laid in wait in the shadows for
mcmanus to walk by,then bang!

07:50.300 --> 07:51.490
three in the ten ring.

07:51.525 --> 07:54.150
Left him deader than a
lobster in butter sauce.

07:54.185 --> 07:56.350
Do we know what time
mcmanus punched out?

07:56.385 --> 07:59.780
Well,we got some residents who say
they heard shots at around 2:45 A.M.,

07:59.815 --> 08:01.020
But they didn't get
a look at the shooter.

08:01.055 --> 08:02.620
Now that's a shame.

08:02.655 --> 08:03.720
All right,then start a canvass.

08:03.755 --> 08:05.360
Round up some likelies.

08:05.395 --> 08:07.240
See who was around at that time.

08:07.275 --> 08:10.170
Well,we could start right here.
What were you doing last night,boss?

08:11.660 --> 08:13.860
Don't you cut your eye on me like that.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.830
Well,have you got an alibi,ray?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.820
Yeah,I got an alibi,all right?

08:19.855 --> 08:21.720
I was getting my groove
on with the missus.

08:21.755 --> 08:24.700
Marathon love all night
long,carling-style.

08:24.735 --> 08:26.600
Well,at least your
wife got her sleep,huh?

08:26.635 --> 08:28.820
Ha ha ha ha ha! Where were you,spaceman?

08:28.855 --> 08:31.730
Oh,I was losing checkers
to my neighbor windy.

08:31.765 --> 08:33.409
- Checkers with windy?
- Yeah.

08:33.445 --> 08:34.950
What kind of name is "windy"?

08:34.985 --> 08:36.640
A 5-letter word for "bite me."

08:36.674 --> 08:39.309
So I'm gonna put together
a list of possible suspects,

08:39.345 --> 08:41.710
anyone who might have
had a beef with mcmanus.

08:41.745 --> 08:44.030
Present company excluded,of course.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.640
I like your initiative,tyler.

08:45.675 --> 08:47.840
In the old days,we called that gusto.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.650
Anybody hungry?

08:49.960 --> 08:54.120
Seeing mcmanus dead on the street gave
me a sudden hankering for corned beef.

08:54.155 --> 08:55.760
Tastes best on rye with mayo.

08:55.795 --> 08:59.270
Lieutenant,there's an agent
morgan outside your office.

08:59.305 --> 09:01.670
Agent? Like insurance agent?

09:01.705 --> 09:03.790
Like fbi agent.

09:05.290 --> 09:07.450
ah. yeah,let me have
the detective call you.

09:08.410 --> 09:09.940
Lieutenant hunt,it's a pleasure.

09:09.975 --> 09:12.230
Special agent franklin morgan.

09:19.110 --> 09:21.140
oh,now that's a good picture.

09:21.175 --> 09:23.840
But I'm partial to ronald
reagan westerns myself.

09:23.875 --> 09:24.990
That's fascinating,frank.

09:25.025 --> 09:26.560
How can I help you?

09:27.270 --> 09:28.930
Well,the fellas down in washington

09:28.965 --> 09:31.940
thought you might want a little
assistance with the,uh,mcmanus case.

09:31.975 --> 09:33.460
Thanks,but no,thanks.

09:33.495 --> 09:35.340
****missing****

09:35.375 --> 09:36.610
****missing****

09:36.645 --> 09:40.210
****missing****

09:40.245 --> 09:43.760
You mean D.C. Sent a starched
collar up here to burp us?

09:43.795 --> 09:45.880
The bureau's been monitoring irish gangs

09:45.915 --> 09:48.050
since mr.Hoover was the top tomato,

09:48.085 --> 09:52.130
and,uh,this case has
obvious interest to our...

09:52.165 --> 09:54.390
our interests.

09:54.425 --> 09:57.640
If you want to share some
information with us,agent morgan,

09:57.675 --> 09:58.950
I'd be happy to keep you apprised.

09:58.985 --> 10:00.450
Okay. Okay.

10:00.485 --> 10:05.330
W-when I said supervise," I really
should have said "investigate,"

10:05.365 --> 10:09.120
as in whether someone from the
1-2-5 is involved in the murder.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.350
Oh!

10:13.385 --> 10:16.120
So you think one of us did it?

10:16.650 --> 10:19.950
Any mystery is merely
a question of drainage.

10:19.985 --> 10:23.080
You remove all the extraneous elements,

10:23.115 --> 10:27.800
and the answer is revealed
like a great,glowing stone.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.730
This murder is on our sheet,

10:30.765 --> 10:32.890
and that means it's
our problem to solve.

10:32.925 --> 10:36.040
And you and your fed
stick don't amount to A...

10:36.075 --> 10:40.270
popcorn fart in the
great,glorious metropolis

10:40.305 --> 10:42.310
thais huntlandia.

10:44.740 --> 10:47.860
Ay. Okay.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.960
But feature this,gentlemen¡ª

10:50.995 --> 10:56.860
some scuzzy irish hood guns down two
of yours and gets scragged himself?

10:56.895 --> 10:59.410
We at the bureau have a saying¡ª

10:59.445 --> 11:02.070
you just ain't that lucky.

11:21.130 --> 11:23.100
gang slaying.

11:23.670 --> 11:25.550
Extortion beef.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.440
Here's gambling debts.

11:28.475 --> 11:29.880
All likely avenues,

11:29.915 --> 11:31.030
but you're ignoring the obvious.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.460
What's the obvious?

11:32.940 --> 11:34.380
One of us?

11:35.590 --> 11:37.110
give it up,pal.

11:37.145 --> 11:39.590
No one in this precinct
killed mcmanus,okay?

11:39.625 --> 11:42.850
I understand that you went
undercover in his gang.

11:42.885 --> 11:47.870
In my experience,hanging out with criminals
brings out the dark side of a person.

11:47.905 --> 11:50.720
How was your relationship
with jimmy mcmanus?

11:50.755 --> 11:53.690
Oh,lovely. We summered
together on the cape,

11:53.725 --> 11:55.230
bonfires in the dunes,

11:55.265 --> 11:56.630
frisbees in the surf.

11:56.665 --> 11:59.240
Mcmanus had a recipe for quahog chowder,

11:59.275 --> 12:00.810
make you weep.

12:02.860 --> 12:03.890
I ain't seen him in a while.

12:03.925 --> 12:05.310
- You?
- no,me neither.

12:05.345 --> 12:07.940
Pepper anderson always
looks for the motive first.

12:07.975 --> 12:11.910
Whoever has the strongest
motive is usually the killer.

12:11.945 --> 12:13.560
Pepper anderson?

12:13.595 --> 12:15.790
"police woman," angie dickinson.

12:15.825 --> 12:17.360
I never miss an episode.

12:17.395 --> 12:21.550
You get a lot of your notions about
solving a murder from a tv show?

12:22.430 --> 12:26.160
I don't watch "police woman" for
the police work,detective tyler.

12:26.195 --> 12:28.630
I watch it for angie dickinson.

12:29.820 --> 12:31.640
I love angie dickinson.

12:33.010 --> 12:37.380
I want to move to vermont and
have babies with angie dickinson.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.140
Do you think that's possible,detective?

12:43.100 --> 12:46.130
Where were you last night
around quarter to 3:00 A.M.?

12:46.165 --> 12:49.080
I was at home with my
neighbor,windy,playing checkers.

12:49.115 --> 12:51.690
- Checkers with windy?
- That's right.

12:51.725 --> 12:53.830
And this windy will corroborate?

12:53.865 --> 12:55.500
She will.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.960
ray,there's a man here who wants to
see a detective about the mcmanus case.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.270
He says he saw the shooter.

13:08.305 --> 13:09.770
Yeah,I'm detective carling.

13:09.805 --> 13:11.150
You here about the shooting last night?

13:11.185 --> 13:13.160
That's right. Clifford
dorsett. I'm a doctor.

13:13.195 --> 13:15.500
I was making a house call
in the housing development.

13:15.535 --> 13:16.940
It was one of my elderly patients.

13:16.975 --> 13:18.930
She has acute diabetes.

13:19.370 --> 13:20.500
Her ankles swell up.

13:20.535 --> 13:22.320
That's fascinating. What'd you see?

13:22.355 --> 13:25.080
Just before I stepped outside,
I heard a-a popping noise,

13:25.115 --> 13:27.230
like firecrackers. And
then a moment later,

13:27.265 --> 13:28.740
a man ran right past me.

13:28.775 --> 13:29.990
I didn't realize till this
morning what was going on

13:30.025 --> 13:31.140
till I heard the news.

13:31.175 --> 13:32.700
Can you describe the man you saw?

13:32.735 --> 13:36.110
Well,he was white,about medium height.

13:36.145 --> 13:37.460
He wore a
leather j--

13:37.495 --> 13:39.510
oh,my god. That's him.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.950
That's who?

13:41.985 --> 13:45.630
The man who ran past me
last night. That's him!

14:01.040 --> 14:02.320
Yeah,boss.

14:02.355 --> 14:07.590
Agent moron--excuse me--
morgan is tossing tyler's pad,

14:07.625 --> 14:10.470
which is yielding exactly
what mrs.Morgan sees

14:10.505 --> 14:14.200
when frankie drops his
drawers-- nothing big.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.300
All right.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.680
chin up there,tyler.

14:18.715 --> 14:21.680
Okay? The good doctor
obviously made a mistake.

14:22.050 --> 14:24.900
Hey,efrem zimbalist junior mint!

14:24.935 --> 14:26.990
How about we wrap it up,huh?

14:27.025 --> 14:31.100
Clearly the only crime is
tyler's taste in clothing.

14:31.135 --> 14:33.980
2-b,what's going on?

14:35.400 --> 14:37.620
It's nothing. It's a misunderstanding.

14:37.655 --> 14:39.750
Did you get busted by the cops?

14:39.785 --> 14:41.150
Wait. Aren't you a cop?

14:41.185 --> 14:43.340
Last night we were playing
checkers till 3:00 in the morning.

14:43.375 --> 14:44.800
I know. I was there.

14:44.835 --> 14:46.820
No,I may need you to tell
the cops in my apartment

14:46.855 --> 14:48.150
that's what we were doing.

14:48.185 --> 14:51.000
detective tyler,would
you get in here a moment?

14:51.035 --> 14:54.080
- I'll be right back. - I'll
be home all day.  - Okay,good.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.300
Oh. Uh,yeah,that'S...

15:05.335 --> 15:07.140
that's research.

15:08.130 --> 15:09.950
I write science fiction.

15:11.020 --> 15:15.110
Wouldn't have taken you
as an author,detective.

15:15.145 --> 15:17.340
But you are full of surprises.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.830
Oh,come on.

15:21.865 --> 15:26.460
.380-- the same caliber gun
used in the mcmanus murder.

15:26.495 --> 15:28.470
- That's not my gun.
- Here.

15:28.505 --> 15:30.640
I have no idea how that got there.

15:30.675 --> 15:33.730
All right,now you sound like the
sad sacks we put the screws to.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.690
I didn't shoot mcmanus,ray.

15:35.725 --> 15:38.850
I was here all night
with my neighbor windy.

15:38.885 --> 15:41.140
You--ask her
yourself. She's home.

15:41.175 --> 15:43.760
I just saw her a second
ago. She'll tell you.

15:43.795 --> 15:46.910
We were playing checkers
till 3:00 in the morning.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.120
Hey,windy.

15:52.060 --> 15:53.810
Windy,it's 2-B.

15:57.170 --> 15:58.670
open the door.

16:06.170 --> 16:13.200
windy? Hello? Windy?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.210
Time to dance,2-B.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.630
It's a garden mix.

16:20.665 --> 16:23.330
Mary jane's magic earth.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.700
I'm telling you...

16:33.735 --> 16:35.650
I spent time with her,okay?

16:35.685 --> 16:39.020
She's a hippie chick,a free spirit.

16:39.055 --> 16:41.240
She makes pot lasagna.

16:41.275 --> 16:42.940
We have...

16:43.360 --> 16:46.960
dance parties to simon
& garfunkel records.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.680
She's my friend.

16:49.715 --> 16:51.420
I had a frie like that once,too.

16:51.455 --> 16:55.240
I called him "jibber."
He was a talking walrus.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.200
Of course was 5.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.750
I think I'm going crazy,annie.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.670
I don't know how else to
explain what's happening to me.

17:43.020 --> 17:48.320
I keep seeing these
flashes of shooting mcmanus,

17:48.900 --> 17:52.850
but I don't remember
doing it or hiding the gun.

17:52.885 --> 17:55.900
It's not possible to
forget something like that.

17:56.380 --> 18:00.190
The witness saw me
running from the scene.

18:00.225 --> 18:01.800
The gun was in my apartment.

18:01.835 --> 18:03.910
Explain that.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.320
I can'T.

18:07.340 --> 18:11.480
And windy--
we--we--we talk.

18:11.515 --> 18:14.720
Well,she talks,a lot.

18:15.210 --> 18:17.330
She calls me "2-B."

18:17.365 --> 18:22.450
As in "to be or not to be"?

18:27.850 --> 18:30.500
The things I told you about me,

18:30.535 --> 18:34.750
about where I'm from,about 2008...

18:36.540 --> 18:37.660
you thought I was crazy.

18:37.695 --> 18:40.300
- I don't anymore.
- But you did.

18:41.030 --> 18:43.980
You started to believe me,but
that still doesn't mean it's true.

18:44.840 --> 18:49.130
There is something bad
and broken inside me,annie.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.350
my father's a killer.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.470
His blood runs through my veins.

18:58.460 --> 19:01.590
You are not your father.

19:02.690 --> 19:05.100
You're not your father.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.640
This is real,sam.

19:11.290 --> 19:15.040
Who you are inside is real.

19:19.180 --> 19:21.660
how I feel about you is real.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.600
How you feel about me?

19:39.600 --> 19:41.550
Whether you're crazy...

19:43.440 --> 19:46.290
and I'm crazy for believing you...

19:47.110 --> 19:51.700
the one thing I know absolutely

19:51.735 --> 19:54.230
is that you are not a killer.

20:23.030 --> 20:26.090
morgan got back the
ballistics on the gun.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.620
It was a match.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.580
I brought you some supper.

20:34.615 --> 20:36.710
Thank you.

20:38.190 --> 20:39.780
I know you don't shoot people,tyler,

20:39.815 --> 20:42.880
and then hide the murder
weapon in your closet.

20:42.915 --> 20:45.240
You're an odd duck,but you're no dummy.

20:45.275 --> 20:47.420
I'll help you how I can.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.580
But you gotta find the real killer.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.900
And how do you want me to do that?

20:51.935 --> 20:54.250
I suggest you eat your chop suey,

20:54.285 --> 20:56.800
open the fortune cookie.

20:56.835 --> 20:59.430
Something will come to you.

21:01.610 --> 21:04.050
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:27.190 --> 21:29.980
so...while you been sleeping,chris,

21:30.015 --> 21:33.520
spiro agnew turned out to be a
great disappointment to us all.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.230
He was taking bribes.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.950
can you imagine?

21:38.985 --> 21:41.300
the vice president taking bribes.

21:41.335 --> 21:42.970
What's next?

21:43.005 --> 21:46.540
The president himself
committing burglary?

21:49.090 --> 21:51.050
where's detective tyler?

21:52.320 --> 21:53.980
You don't even ask how
my guy here is doing?

21:54.015 --> 21:55.370
Where's tyler?

21:55.405 --> 21:57.120
He's gonna pull through.

21:57.155 --> 22:00.020
He's a tough little bastard.
Don't let the baby face fool ya.

22:00.055 --> 22:03.090
No finer man you want by your
side when things get dangerous.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.480
I'll submit him for a medal of honor.

22:04.515 --> 22:06.260
Where's tyler?

22:06.870 --> 22:09.350
Last I saw detective tyler,

22:09.385 --> 22:11.980
he was in his cell,sleeping.

22:12.015 --> 22:14.680
- He is not in his cell.
- Sure he is.

22:14.715 --> 22:17.350
But when he sleeps,he turns invisible.

22:17.850 --> 22:19.530
Suggest you go back down there.

22:19.565 --> 22:22.780
and if you're real quiet,you
can hear him snoring.

22:22.815 --> 22:25.110
it's a funny little snore.

22:29.310 --> 22:31.880
it's got a whistle on the end.

22:31.915 --> 22:37.190
I promise you,I will find
out who helped tyler escape,

22:37.225 --> 22:39.870
and that person will
be dealt with harshly.

22:39.905 --> 22:41.360
If you want tyler so bad,

22:41.395 --> 22:43.630
why don't you go after him yourself?

22:43.665 --> 22:47.870
None of his 1-2-5- brethren are gonna
let him play patsy on that mope's murder.

22:47.905 --> 22:50.610
As we speak,his photo is being
distributed throughout the city,

22:50.645 --> 22:52.290
to newspapers and tv stations.

22:52.325 --> 22:53.880
We'll catch tyler,

22:53.915 --> 22:58.510
and when I'm done with him,he'll be in
rikers,eating bologna out of a straw.

23:22.870 --> 23:23.880
are you kidding me,little patrick?

23:23.915 --> 23:26.140
How many times are you gonna try
and toss the garbage in there?

23:26.175 --> 23:27.590
What did you think was going on?

23:28.190 --> 23:29.290
Wacky raccoons?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.680
What the hell you doin' in there?

23:30.715 --> 23:31.810
We need to talk.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.660
Yeah,the police kill jimmy and you got
the pills to think I'm gonna talk to you?

23:34.695 --> 23:35.910
The police didn't kill jimmy.

23:35.945 --> 23:37.280
I'm trying to figure out who did.

23:37.315 --> 23:38.660
Oh,yeah,from inside a dumpster?

23:38.695 --> 23:40.480
- Who wanted your boss dead?
- You.

23:40.515 --> 23:42.380
- No,I didn't kill him.
- You didn't kill him?

23:42.415 --> 23:43.940
No,I'm trying to find
out who wanted him dead.

23:43.975 --> 23:45.280
- Who wanted him dead?
- Yes.

23:45.315 --> 23:47.340
Half the city of new york¡ª

23:47.375 --> 23:50.760
the cops,the italians,the russians,his
high school metal shop teacher,

23:50.795 --> 23:55.570
his ex-girlfriend,two of my
ex-girlfriends and jimmy's father.

23:55.605 --> 23:57.160
Anything more recent?

23:58.780 --> 24:01.200
- You want another one of these,boyo?
- Okay,okay,okay.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.550
About a week before you
reared your ugly head,

24:04.585 --> 24:07.840
he had us swipe this big rig
hauling swag out of J.F.K.

24:07.875 --> 24:10.580
We was back at the pony celebrating,

24:10.615 --> 24:13.530
and this average-looking joe
comes in. He powwows with jimmy.

24:13.565 --> 24:15.730
Next thing I hear,we
gotta give the truck back.

24:15.765 --> 24:17.060
Whatever this joe said,

24:17.095 --> 24:19.500
it spooked jimmy bad enough
to hand back a decent score.

24:19.535 --> 24:21.240
What was in the truck?

24:21.275 --> 24:22.880
Toys.

24:22.915 --> 24:23.960
Toys?

24:23.995 --> 24:28.000
Yeah,kids' toys from
the aries toy company.

24:28.035 --> 24:29.830
The aries toy company?

24:29.865 --> 24:32.750
Yeah. That's what it said
on the side of the truck--

24:32.785 --> 24:34.980
aries toy company.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.040
1-2-5 squad. This
is officer norris.

24:43.075 --> 24:44.170
Annie,it's me.

24:44.205 --> 24:47.040
Sam,where are you? Are you okay?

24:47.075 --> 24:48.100
I don't have time to talk right now.

24:48.135 --> 24:49.490
I need you to do me a favor.

24:49.525 --> 24:52.500
Uh,okay,dad.

24:52.535 --> 24:53.870
How's grandma feeling?

24:53.905 --> 24:54.940
Grandma's feeling a
little cold right now,

24:54.975 --> 24:56.750
but I need you to check
out an aries toy company.

24:56.785 --> 24:59.570
I need an address,employee
directory,anything.

24:59.605 --> 25:01.930
What's grandma gonna need that for?

25:01.965 --> 25:04.990
Just meet me under the queensboro
bridge on the queens side at 5:00.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.380
I'll explain everything.

25:08.100 --> 25:11.760
Okay,dad. Take care.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.380
no.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.880
- Annie.
- Oh,sam.

25:58.915 --> 26:00.420
God,you look terrible.

26:00.455 --> 26:02.670
Well,I was going for awful,but
terrible's close enough.

26:02.705 --> 26:04.440
Put this on,please.

26:04.475 --> 26:05.710
Thank you for doing this,

26:05.745 --> 26:06.920
for helping me,

26:07.230 --> 26:08.890
for having faith in me.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.900
Thank you.

26:10.935 --> 26:12.630
Have faith in yourself,sam.

26:12.665 --> 26:14.670
I'm not there yet. What did you dig up?

26:14.705 --> 26:18.720
Aries toy company-- it's a
toy manufacturer in greenpoint.

26:18.755 --> 26:21.150
They make everything from
rubber balls to stuffed animals,

26:21.185 --> 26:22.950
you know,stuff yod
find at a five-and-dime.

26:22.985 --> 26:24.080
Sounds like a front.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.820
The names of employees,owners?

26:25.855 --> 26:28.330
Oddly enough,no. Just the address.

26:28.365 --> 26:30.490
Nice job,annie.

26:30.700 --> 26:31.850
oh,god. That's agent morgan.

26:31.885 --> 26:33.610
He must have followed
me. You gotta go,sam.

26:33.645 --> 26:36.450
- I'm sorry for this mess. Sorry.
- Go.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.890
all right,where is he?

26:52.925 --> 26:55.450
- Miss norris,where is he?
- He's not here.

26:55.485 --> 26:57.300
Find him. No,no.

26:57.335 --> 27:00.210
What--aiding and abetting a
fugitive is a felony,miss norris.

27:00.245 --> 27:02.650
- You can't just drag someone into
your car! - Oh,yes--oh,yes I can.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.760
you need a lift,spaceman?

27:17.040 --> 27:19.120
Hop in before I change my mind.

27:34.640 --> 27:38.170
so,uh,why the sudden
display of benevolence,ray?

27:38.205 --> 27:39.930
You seen "death wish" yet?

27:39.965 --> 27:42.480
It's like the "citizen
kane" of revenge flicks.

27:42.515 --> 27:44.160
Yeah,I saw it a long time ago.

27:44.195 --> 27:46.520
It just came out last month.

27:46.555 --> 27:48.030
It's a long story.

27:48.065 --> 27:51.920
Yeah,well,anyway,you
ain't no charles bronson.

27:51.955 --> 27:53.900
Now whoever did kill mcmanus,

27:53.935 --> 27:57.800
they should get a free weekend in
atlantic city with a 7-breasted hooker.

27:57.835 --> 28:01.070
But I know it wasn't a righteous
boy scoulike you that plugged him.

28:01.105 --> 28:03.400
Yeah. Glad to hear that.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.180
All right. Wherever you
need to go,I'll take you.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.010
aries toy company,greenpoint,brooklyn.

28:13.045 --> 28:16.270
Yep,leave it to you.

28:16.305 --> 28:20.290
The guy's got half the population of new
york's finest looking to collar his ass,

28:20.325 --> 28:23.400
and spaceman wants to go buy a slinky.

28:29.110 --> 28:34.590
by the way,I'd have a lot more respect
for you if you had killed mcmanus.

28:36.640 --> 28:40.920
I used to be like sted,idealistic.

28:40.955 --> 28:43.270
Betrayal can be a
tough cookie to swallow.

28:43.305 --> 28:48.000
What are you getting
at,you enormous dullard?

28:49.280 --> 28:51.330
Sam tyler is unstable.

28:51.365 --> 28:53.740
He thinks he's from the future,

28:54.180 --> 28:57.640
that little mechanical
creatures crawl up his nose,

28:58.610 --> 29:01.070
that his own father shot him.

29:04.350 --> 29:06.240
How do you know this?

29:12.660 --> 29:15.000
sam's department psych file.

29:15.035 --> 29:16.860
It's supposed to be confidential.

29:16.895 --> 29:18.880
Sam tyler killed jimmy mcmanus,

29:18.915 --> 29:20.510
and you helped him avoid the law.

29:20.545 --> 29:22.260
I want to know where he's hiding out.

29:22.295 --> 29:25.110
Sam didn't kill jimmy mcmanus.

29:27.010 --> 29:29.680
It was someone from
the aries toy company.

29:29.715 --> 29:32.960
Mcmanus hijacked one of their trucks.

29:33.950 --> 29:35.720
is that right?

29:36.620 --> 29:40.550
A toy company sought revenge
against a psychotic irish gangster?

29:40.585 --> 29:42.090
For what?

29:43.450 --> 29:45.860
Abusing a hula-hoop?

29:48.960 --> 29:51.090
This is all very scooby-doo.

29:51.125 --> 29:52.400
What do you mean?

29:52.435 --> 29:54.740
A toy company harboring pure evil?

29:54.775 --> 29:55.990
That's gotta be a first.

29:56.025 --> 29:58.770
At least you've never met
a certain purple dinosaur.

29:58.805 --> 30:01.670
* go all the way *

30:03.020 --> 30:05.390
it sounds like a party going on.

30:06.900 --> 30:10.890
* Don't ever let me go *

30:24.770 --> 30:27.010
don't look so evil to me.

30:32.110 --> 30:33.530
Okay.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.890
Easy does it,sweetheart.

30:36.700 --> 30:40.240
Actually,spaceman,I think we
may have stumbled upon heaven.

30:41.060 --> 30:42.530
****missing****

30:45.920 --> 30:49.050
* she kissed me and
said,"baby,please"  *

30:49.085 --> 30:52.520
* go all the way *

30:53.590 --> 30:55.620
* it feels so right feels *

30:55.655 --> 31:01.270
* so right being with you here tonight *

31:01.305 --> 31:06.580
* please go all the way *

31:06.615 --> 31:08.010
ray.

31:08.045 --> 31:11.420
* Just hold me close hold me close *

31:11.455 --> 31:15.810
{a6}* don't ever let me go *

31:14.480 --> 31:16.660
another one? Here you go.

31:16.695 --> 31:18.090
Hello,dr. Dorsett.

31:19.170 --> 31:24.510
* Till she whispered,"I
love you,so please"  *

31:25.220 --> 31:27.190
no house calls tonight,doctor?

31:27.225 --> 31:28.740
I'm guessing that pouring
drinks is as close as

31:28.775 --> 31:30.610
you get to dispensing medicine,huh?

31:30.645 --> 31:31.820
It looks like the good
doctor doesn't know

31:31.855 --> 31:34.100
whether to poop or wind his watch.

31:34.135 --> 31:36.130
All right,I'm no doctor. All right?

31:36.165 --> 31:37.550
Who the hell are you?

31:37.585 --> 31:39.260
I'm an actor.

31:39.295 --> 31:40.610
I tend bar at night.

31:40.645 --> 31:42.240
I got head shots with me.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.820
Well,that's good,'cause we're
casting for bozo the clown.

31:44.855 --> 31:45.840
Who told you to lie to the police

31:45.875 --> 31:47.270
about seeing me that night,huh?

31:47.305 --> 31:48.800
- Who set me up?
- I don't know.

31:48.835 --> 31:50.140
It was just a gig. I swear.

31:50.175 --> 31:51.990
all right. All right. All right!

31:52.025 --> 31:55.830
Hey,hey. Come on. Take it
easy. Take it easy. All right?

31:55.865 --> 31:56.850
We'll take him back to the house.

31:56.885 --> 31:58.490
We'll brace him there.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.140
Yeah,put him in the car.

32:00.175 --> 32:01.240
You all right?

32:01.275 --> 32:03.400
I'm gonna have a look around.

32:03.500 --> 32:09.010
* Where my heart should have
been but now I'm changed,*

32:09.045 --> 32:11.460
* and I feel so strange I come alive *

32:11.495 --> 32:13.830
* when she says all those things to me *

32:13.865 --> 32:22.860
* and she says come on come
on come on come on come on *

32:22.895 --> 32:26.780
* I love you come on
I need you come on,*

32:26.815 --> 32:33.400
* me on please it feels so right *

32:36.830 --> 32:38.390
Wait.

32:38.440 --> 32:42.610
* Being with you here tonight *

32:42.645 --> 32:48.530
* please go all the way *

32:48.565 --> 32:53.190
* just hold me close hold me close *

32:53.225 --> 32:57.790
* don't ever let me go
don't let me go oh,no *

32:57.940 --> 33:02.240
detective tyler,you weren't
supposed to peek behind the curtain.

33:04.060 --> 33:06.500
{a6}* Ooh oh,yeah *

33:05.870 --> 33:08.240
you've become a real problem for me,sam.

33:08.275 --> 33:09.320
You know that?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.200
I get that feeling,yeah.

33:11.235 --> 33:13.490
All right,move it.

33:14.140 --> 33:15.660
Who are these people?

33:15.695 --> 33:17.330
We call 'em clients.

33:26.530 --> 33:29.060
You killed jimmy mcmanus
'cause he stole a truck.

33:29.095 --> 33:30.130
What did he see?

33:30.165 --> 33:32.710
Nothing that concerned
him,or you,for that matter.

33:32.745 --> 33:33.730
Why did you frame me?

33:33.765 --> 33:35.680
Ah,sam.

33:35.715 --> 33:39.550
If you'd just played it cool and listened
to me instead of being so damn curious,

33:39.585 --> 33:40.800
none of this would have happened.

33:40.835 --> 33:42.500
Listened to you?

33:48.140 --> 33:49.440
hello,sam.

33:52.880 --> 33:56.830
You were the one who called me and
told me to go into the basement?

33:56.865 --> 33:58.100
Who do you work for,morgan?

33:58.135 --> 33:59.730
The dream police.

33:59.765 --> 34:01.670
We live inside your head.

34:01.705 --> 34:03.030
We mold your soul.

34:03.065 --> 34:05.660
Well,we don't,but,uh,

34:05.695 --> 34:09.530
our little friends that we
send inside your brain do.

34:13.820 --> 34:17.030
We send miniature robot into human body

34:17.065 --> 34:18.949
to confirm or deny

34:18.985 --> 34:22.949
the existence of a human soul.

34:22.985 --> 34:25.020
those tiny robots?

34:27.449 --> 34:32.060
- You put one of those things in my head?
- We did.

34:32.094 --> 34:34.530
But it seems to have gone on the fritz.

34:34.565 --> 34:37.480
It's tapped into your baser instincts,

34:38.270 --> 34:40.520
the dark blood of your father.

34:43.110 --> 34:46.620
You were on your way to exact revenge,

34:46.655 --> 34:47.670
to commit murder.

34:47.705 --> 34:48.770
We couldn't let that happen.

34:48.804 --> 34:52.659
If it did,everything we worked
for would have gone awry.

34:53.610 --> 34:55.469
You got me,copper.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.030
What you gonna do?

35:03.910 --> 35:05.730
and that's why it's over.

35:05.765 --> 35:07.690
Go on. Get up there.

35:07.725 --> 35:10.210
Come on! Get up there!

35:18.970 --> 35:20.480
Go on!

35:33.700 --> 35:35.760
We're sending you home.

35:37.640 --> 35:40.390
- what did you say?
- It's time to go home,sam.

35:40.425 --> 35:42.640
Maya's waiting for you...

35:43.090 --> 35:46.050
and your mother--
such a lovely woman...

35:46.085 --> 35:51.920
your friends,coworkers,new
nine inch nails record.

35:51.955 --> 35:53.700
What did you say?

35:54.240 --> 35:56.930
excuse me. Cd.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.180
It's time.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.550
One small step...

36:14.540 --> 36:16.370
and you fly.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.410
drop the gun!

36:25.960 --> 36:28.230
- What are you doing,hunt?
- I got him cornered.

36:28.265 --> 36:29.520
ah,forget it,frank.

36:29.555 --> 36:34.300
The oscar for best supporting dingbat
has already gone to dr.Dorsett,

36:34.335 --> 36:36.930
who's singing a sweet
song about the frame job

36:36.965 --> 36:39.520
you put on tyler for the mcmanus murder.

36:39.555 --> 36:41.630
Tyler,get down from
there before you get hurt.

36:43.860 --> 36:44.860
Tyler,get down.

36:44.895 --> 36:46.650
Sam!

36:47.050 --> 36:48.870
Don't listen to 'em,sam.

36:48.905 --> 36:50.900
They're just a part of your psyche.

36:50.935 --> 36:54.260
They want you to stay in 1973.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.160
You know the way home.

36:56.195 --> 36:58.680
Sam,don't do it. Please.

36:59.940 --> 37:01.450
Go home to maya.

37:01.485 --> 37:02.510
sam.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.980
Don't believe him.

37:05.015 --> 37:06.480
He read your department psych file.

37:06.515 --> 37:07.910
That's how he knows everything.

37:07.945 --> 37:09.900
Go home to the future,sam.

37:09.935 --> 37:13.600
Heck,they've made a fourth
"raiders of the lost ark."

37:13.635 --> 37:16.980
While it's not a great
movie,it's really worth seeing.

37:17.015 --> 37:18.820
How could-- how
could he know that?

37:18.855 --> 37:21.390
What? I didn't say anything.

37:21.425 --> 37:23.690
- "Raiders."
- Who?

37:27.760 --> 37:31.030
sam,one last step. Just take that step.

37:31.065 --> 37:35.610
Can it,morgan. Tyler,the joke
is over. Get off that edge.

37:36.330 --> 37:39.360
Tyler! Step down! Annie!

37:39.395 --> 37:40.990
No-nuts,what are you on,dope?

37:41.025 --> 37:43.090
Annie,what are you doing?

37:44.330 --> 37:47.620
Sam...if you don't think I'm real...

37:48.130 --> 37:50.560
then it won't matter if I jump with you.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.530
You know what's real,sam.

38:05.220 --> 38:06.830
You know what's real.

38:40.620 --> 38:44.010
* who's peekin' out
from under a stairway *

38:44.045 --> 38:47.810
* calling a name that's
lighter than air? *

38:47.845 --> 38:51.010
* Give me a rainbow? *

38:51.230 --> 38:54.840
* Everyone knows it's windy *

39:00.290 --> 39:01.390
2-b!

39:01.425 --> 39:03.200
You look like you've seen a ghost.

39:03.235 --> 39:04.930
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

39:04.965 --> 39:06.100
How did that thing go with the cops?

39:06.135 --> 39:07.850
They never came to talk to me.

39:07.885 --> 39:10.950
They did. We did.

39:10.985 --> 39:13.250
But you weren't there.

39:14.270 --> 39:15.500
Your apartment is...

39:15.535 --> 39:17.510
empty,I know.

39:17.545 --> 39:19.250
I'm so embarrassed.

39:19.285 --> 39:22.520
My ex-boyfriend--
crazy luke mcmullen¡ª

39:22.555 --> 39:24.320
I told you about him,right?

39:24.355 --> 39:26.930
He joined a cult to get
out of valentine's day.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.440
He cleaned everything out.

39:29.475 --> 39:31.220
What a drag.

39:31.255 --> 39:34.550
I think that you're a
figment of my imagination.

39:36.700 --> 39:40.520
I'm flattered. I once had a
figment of the imagination,

39:40.555 --> 39:42.890
only he looked like jimmy page.

39:43.210 --> 39:48.690
But then again,what is real anyhow?

39:49.230 --> 39:52.600
We are alive,and then we are not.

39:52.635 --> 39:54.710
We move on.

39:54.745 --> 39:56.400
Who knows to where?

39:56.435 --> 39:59.450
Eventually,someone else will
be living in our apartments,

39:59.485 --> 40:01.740
in our city,in our world,

40:01.775 --> 40:04.950
and we'll be off and away.

40:07.670 --> 40:11.350
We all have different paths,2-B.

40:11.385 --> 40:15.040
But we share the same future,don't we?

40:15.860 --> 40:17.300
* Who's reachin' out *

40:17.480 --> 40:21.050
which is why we are here for each other.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.980
* Everyone knows it's windy *

40:23.220 --> 40:24.940
* who's trippin' down
the streets ofhe city *

40:24.975 --> 40:30.430
* smiling at everybody she sees? *

40:31.230 --> 40:32.710
So it turns out

40:32.745 --> 40:36.110
agent morgan was involved in
all sorts of illicit smuggling.

40:36.145 --> 40:38.840
And mcmanus tried to
rip a guy like that off.

40:38.875 --> 40:41.070
Not too smart,huh,chris?

40:41.105 --> 40:42.830
now frank's off to federal pen.

40:42.865 --> 40:45.790
The guy was like a mustard
burp-- momentarily tangy,
