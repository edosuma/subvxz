WEBVTT

00:02.969 --> 00:05.007
Metatron took my grace.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.241
Angels, they're falling.

00:09.309 --> 00:10.720
Miss me?

00:12.079 --> 00:13.353
Metatron, you're mortal now.

00:14.081 --> 00:15.924
- Unh.
- How do we get rid of the Mark?

00:16.250 --> 00:17.422
I don't know.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.927
- What about the tablets?
- No. There's nothing in them about the Mark.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.695
- Shoot him.
- No. No. No, your grace. I'll take you to it.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.670
- Anything about the Mark?
- Yeah. I found this Book of the Damned.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.900
- I'll go check it out.
- Charlie, thank you.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.270
Arrivederci, bitches.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.106
Rowena.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.506
Not possible.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.412
Mark of Cain never lets its host die easy.

00:41.241 --> 00:44.620
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Saving my son.

00:44.878 --> 00:49.088
Mother says that Mark is just a curse.
Can be removed.

00:49.283 --> 00:53.231
- I'm good. Thanks.
- I don't buy that the Mark is terminal.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.799
- There has to be a way, and we will find it.
- Okay.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.640
Who the hell are you?
And why are you following me?

02:15.802 --> 02:20.842
Heh, I ain't following you. I'm following
what you got in your bag there.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.821
That don't belong to you, girl.
Belongs to my family.

02:28.048 --> 02:31.393
Yeah. Well, sorry, Gambit. Finders keepers.

02:35.455 --> 02:39.665
It's beyond your understanding.
Hell, you can't even read it.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.171
Are you always so condescending when
someones pointing a blade at you?

02:43.363 --> 02:47.243
Now, you look here. You can cut me down...

02:47.467 --> 02:50.209
...but my people will never stop.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.977
And you can tiptoe through
the tulips like you did in Russia.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.883
Or you can stowaway on the
back of a train like you did in Alaska.

02:58.745 --> 03:03.421
But soon enough, my kin will find you.
This ends with you dead.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.704
You can't run forever, little girl.

03:29.276 --> 03:32.120
Our flashback
playback continues with a song...

03:32.279 --> 03:36.591
...that climbed up to number four on the
charts. Here's Alanis Morissette's "Ironic."

03:39.419 --> 03:43.731
Really? That song is a classic.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.967
Yeah, I hear you. I do.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.636
And you're right.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.776
Inclement weather
on the day of your nuptials...

03:53.967 --> 03:58.279
...and the wrong cutlery at
inopportune times is hardly ironic.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.620
But it sure is catchy.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.250
Yeah. Fair point. Can't argue taste.

04:09.449 --> 04:13.556
But, ugh, since I became human...

04:13.754 --> 04:17.565
...it's just so strange.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.930
All these feelings, you know?

04:20.127 --> 04:22.835
I mean, I can feel music.

04:23.063 --> 04:27.842
Like that last song, "Sussudio." I don't
even know what it's about, and I love it.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.981
I always enjoyed lyrics, words, stories.

04:32.172 --> 04:36.814
It gives me goose bumps. And goose bumps,
don't get me started on those.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.081
Creepy.

04:39.579 --> 04:42.287
And yet arousing.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.196
- Cass.
- Can I just kill him now?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.695
- You know I can hear you, right?
- No. We need him alive.

04:52.859 --> 04:57.501
For now. Look, after he gives you your grace
back, you can do whatever you want with him.

04:57.697 --> 05:01.201
- Well, I'd like to kill him slowly.
- I am like two feet from you.

05:01.368 --> 05:04.144
- Anything on the Mark of Cain?
- Every word. Crystal clear.

05:04.337 --> 05:08.376
No. I mean, I've been digging
for something, for anything.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.885
- But I don't know, Cass.
- There is an answer out there.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.386
We will find a cure for Dean.

05:14.648 --> 05:19.188
Don't know why you'd wanna cure that little
firecracker now. He's finally interesting... Oh!

05:19.386 --> 05:22.128
- Well, just keep digging.
- Yeah.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.667
Yeah. No one here by that name. Sorry.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.864
Sam?

05:29.362 --> 05:31.069
Lose reception?

05:31.231 --> 05:33.074
Or did he hang up on you?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.876
He hung up on you, didn't he? Heh.

05:40.574 --> 05:46.183
I've been checking through everything
again, double-checking and triple-checking.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.924
- The Mark is a curse.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.727
No, Sam. It's, uh...

05:52.919 --> 05:54.398
It's an actual curse.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.100
What are you talking about?

05:59.259 --> 06:00.431
Crowley told me.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.904
Or rather, Rowena told him
after she tried and failed to kill me.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.037
What the hell happened?

06:08.401 --> 06:09.709
The Mark protected me.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.715
Rowena doesn't really have beef with me.

06:13.907 --> 06:17.047
She was pissed at Crowley
because she thinks he's going soft.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.417
- She's not wrong.
- Yeah, well...

06:19.613 --> 06:21.889
...after he and mommy dearest
got into a fight...

06:22.082 --> 06:23.117
"Mommy dearest"?

06:25.452 --> 06:26.954
Rowena's Crowley's mother.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.361
More about that later.

06:31.558 --> 06:36.098
So then he came
and told me what she had said.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.270
The Mark is an actual curse.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.640
So anyway, I'm sorry.
I probably should've told you that.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.209
Yeah.

06:48.541 --> 06:49.781
I got it.

06:51.211 --> 06:54.784
- Winchester Accounting. How
may I help you? CHARLIE: Dean?

06:55.048 --> 06:57.392
Charlie? What's going on? Where are you?

06:57.584 --> 07:03.626
I, uh... I'm exhausted, and I'm bleeding,
and I'm in a phone booth. A phone booth.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.497
I didn't think these existed
outside of Bill and Ted's...

07:06.760 --> 07:10.333
Okay. Hey, hey. Take a deep breath, kiddo.
We're both sitting here.

07:10.497 --> 07:13.842
- Tell me what happened. Why are you bleeding?
- I, uh...

07:14.000 --> 07:15.070
I got shot.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.280
Did you know dental floss
works great on stitches?

07:19.472 --> 07:20.610
I only passed out twice.

07:20.807 --> 07:24.778
And I'm pretty sure
my wound is now minty-fresh.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.024
Charlie, you probably need
to go to a hospital.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.954
No. No. I'm fine.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.661
I just gotta get someplace safe.
These guys are still after me.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.696
What guys? Who?

07:35.855 --> 07:37.960
Some southern-fried D-bags.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.798
They've been after me since
I dug up the Book of the Damned.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.634
You found it? Where?

07:42.829 --> 07:45.708
After some near misses
and some broken-into museums...

07:45.865 --> 07:50.007
...I found some historical documents
that lead to monastery in Spain.

07:50.203 --> 07:54.549
It burned down years ago. Left for dead.
But I have this hunch about it.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.879
Turned out I was right.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.279
Charlie, what does it say about the Mark?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.152
I have no fracking idea.

08:01.348 --> 08:05.319
The language it's written in,
I've never seen anything like it.

08:05.518 --> 08:10.797
I found some research notes in the monastery
crypt, though, by the friar that buried it.

08:11.558 --> 08:15.199
The Book of the Damned
is a spell book for creating or undoing...

08:15.395 --> 08:18.069
...any kind of damnation there is.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.303
We translate this thing...

08:20.700 --> 08:23.306
...I think we can get
the Mark of Cain off you, Dean.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.476
Charlie, you're a genius.

08:27.574 --> 08:30.020
A genius fugitive. I...

08:30.210 --> 08:32.918
These dudes following me,
they are well-trained.

08:33.078 --> 08:36.082
- One of them keeps talking about his family.
- Family? Get a name?

08:36.349 --> 08:39.227
No clue. I spotted a tattoo on one of them.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.697
Might be a family crest? Seemed occult-y.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.033
Soon as the book was out of the ground
they were all over me.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.569
I, uh...

08:48.028 --> 08:50.099
I don't know how much more
running I got left.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.276
They're tracking the book somehow.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.777
Then we need to get you off the grid,
Charlie. Where are you now?

08:55.935 --> 08:58.108
Uh, just south of Des Maine-s.

08:58.605 --> 09:02.576
Uh. Okay. Our friend Bobby has a whole
bunch of cabins scattered all around.

09:02.776 --> 09:07.623
Places for hunters to crash. There's gear, lore
books. To keep you busy until we get there.

09:07.881 --> 09:12.887
Okay. Bring snacks. And every Men
of Letters decoder ring there is.

09:13.086 --> 09:17.865
This book is old and scary,
and I've never seen anything like it.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.973
Hey. Check it out.
I found this in the storage room.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.373
It's lead-lined and warded.

09:28.568 --> 09:33.074
If those guys are tracking this book, pretty
sure this bad boy will take it off the radar.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.141
Ready?

09:45.785 --> 09:47.162
What?

09:47.487 --> 09:48.557
Nothing.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.767
Nothing. I just haven't seen you
like this in a while. That's all.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.406
- It's a good song, man. Shut up.
- Yeah. It's...

09:58.431 --> 10:03.346
Look, man. It has been one crap sandwich after
another the past few weeks. You heard Charlie.

10:03.503 --> 10:06.677
We got a shot at fixing this.
If that don't put gas in your tank...

10:06.906 --> 10:10.683
If my "shot," you mean a spell in a book
we can't read, that's being tracked...

10:10.910 --> 10:14.483
We're due for a win, okay? O for 2.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.628
I'll tell you another thing.
If this actually does work...

10:19.018 --> 10:21.191
...we're gonna take some time off.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.501
- What, like a vacation?
- Mm-hm.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.659
And I'm not talking
just a weekend in Vegas.

10:26.826 --> 10:30.205
Or sitting in some crap motel
watching pay-per-porn.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.007
No. I'm talking about a beach.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.975
Drinking cervezas. Go for a swim.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.547
Mingle with the local wildlife.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.816
When was the last time
either one of us was on a beach?

10:45.945 --> 10:48.186
- Never.
- Never.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.821
Sand between our toes, Sammy.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.497
Sand between our toes.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.961
...back today?

10:55.121 --> 10:58.193
Those wild-eyed boys that had been away

10:58.358 --> 11:01.066
Haven't changed, haven't much to say

11:01.227 --> 11:06.199
But man, I still think them cats are great
The boys are back in town

11:15.241 --> 11:21.886
Mm. Oh-Em-Me.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.752
Oh.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.690
Food.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.562
Glorious food. Mm.

11:31.724 --> 11:35.763
All the countless descriptions
in so many books.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.566
But those are just words.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.710
Oh.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.369
The taste.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.604
The...

11:43.870 --> 11:46.111
The actual taste.

11:47.106 --> 11:50.087
I had no idea. Oh.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.383
And the process?

11:54.013 --> 11:56.118
Goes in here...

11:56.916 --> 11:58.953
...comes out here.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.621
Sorcery.

12:02.288 --> 12:05.292
I mean, you used to be human.
Don't you miss all this?

12:06.759 --> 12:11.299
No. I don't miss digestion.
I don't miss indigestion...

12:11.531 --> 12:15.638
No, not that. I mean,
don't you miss the feeling of all of this?

12:17.103 --> 12:19.583
Like the taste of these waffles.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.113
The sound of a child's laughter.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.153
Look at us.

12:25.645 --> 12:31.652
We're a couple angels who've touched
not only the divine, but the mundane.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.656
- You and I have a lot in common.
- Don't.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.091
What?

12:38.291 --> 12:41.500
I thought we were having a moment.
Can't we be besties?

12:41.661 --> 12:45.438
No. Because you killed my friend.

12:45.632 --> 12:49.102
Oh, pfft, Dean is fine, mostly.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.804
Can't you get past that?

12:51.337 --> 12:52.975
Never.

12:53.172 --> 12:59.179
Now, we've hit three of your so-called
safe houses, and all of them are empty.

12:59.345 --> 13:03.487
So, either you've lost my grace,
or you're stalling.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.991
Can you blame me?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.497
The minute I hand over
your grace, I'm dead.

13:12.692 --> 13:16.663
You have made your bed, Metatron,
and nothing is going to get you out of it.

13:24.037 --> 13:28.986
- What are you doing?
- I think I need to use the little boy's room.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.615
Little help?

13:40.386 --> 13:42.229
Oh, quick.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.054
- Charlie?
- Merry Christmas.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.026
Hey.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.189
- Were you followed?
- No. No.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.561
- How you feeling?
- Um...

14:15.388 --> 14:18.426
I may have just passed out,
but better, heh.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.098
- Where's the book'?
- Okay. Here's what I've learned so far.

14:24.864 --> 14:30.439
About 700 years ago, a nun locked herself
away after having visions of darkness.

14:30.937 --> 14:37.218
After a few decades squirreled away
by herself, she emerged with this.

14:37.410 --> 14:42.951
Each page is made out of slices
of her own skin, written in her blood.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.730
I told you. It's eek-ish.

14:45.918 --> 14:49.422
According to the notes I found,
it's been owned and used by...

14:49.622 --> 14:54.298
...cults, covens,
even the Vatican had it for a while.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.063
There's a spell inside
that thing for everything.

14:57.263 --> 15:01.803
We're talking some black-mass,
dark-magic, end-of-times nastiness.

15:02.301 --> 15:06.249
As far as the language it's written in,
I'm thinking it's some kind of...

15:06.472 --> 15:07.712
Dean.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.449
- Dean.
- What?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.928
I don't think it's a good idea
that I touch this.

15:27.326 --> 15:30.637
- I'll go get the rest of our crap.
- Right.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.010
What the hell was that?

15:36.169 --> 15:40.640
He's not getting better.
He's trying to cover, but...

15:40.840 --> 15:43.514
We need to find that cure fast.

15:49.182 --> 15:52.652
Sorry about the mess.
I guess I'm lactose intolerant.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.763
Let's never speak of it again.

15:55.755 --> 15:59.293
Metatron and Castiel, heh-heh-heh.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.461
This really must be my lucky day.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.368
Two birds, one blade.

16:06.265 --> 16:09.178
- Who are you?
- Just a cupid.

16:09.368 --> 16:14.374
- Just an angry, angry cupid.
- I understand you're upset.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.816
You both corrupted heaven.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.545
It's never gonna be the same.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.073
I owed you that one anyway.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.415
This changes nothing.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.097
You're welcome.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.704
Okay. I got a pretty good look at his
tattoo. It's something like this.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.108
The douche clan. Got it.

17:14.367 --> 17:18.611
This is everything Men of Letters had on occult
families, so should be something in here.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.242
Sam, got anything?

17:21.440 --> 17:25.080
Maybe, yeah.
It's all in an obscure Sumerian dialect.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.088
- I found a rough match for it in this book.
- Great.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.887
I thought so too, but
I've been translating.

17:31.083 --> 17:35.031
But none of the translated words
make any sense. It's all just gibberish.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.959
I mean, maybe it's in a different dialect?

17:38.190 --> 17:41.535
No, no, no, you're right, but I think...

17:42.628 --> 17:44.039
I think. this is in code.

17:44.964 --> 17:50.141
An entire book of unreadable text
that's also in code. Great. Ah.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.647
And you call yourselves nerds.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.307
Come on. You got this.

17:56.142 --> 17:59.919
He's right. Let's get our Alan Turing on.
Decrypt this bitch.

18:11.123 --> 18:14.332
You know what, Charlie? Why-f? Um...

18:14.493 --> 18:20.068
Why don'! we stick with my notes for a little
bit? This book is literally making my eyes hurt.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.028
- What is it?
- Shh.

19:01.173 --> 19:03.710
Damn...

19:05.111 --> 19:07.557
She found a way to hide the book.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.987
It was here.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.562
It was on this road.

19:15.988 --> 19:20.334
She was on this road. Heh-heh.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.804
Send the boys up and down the way.
See if anybody saw her.

19:24.630 --> 19:28.407
Come on. You expect me to believe
that you hid my grace in a library?

19:28.567 --> 19:32.572
Nobody goes to libraries anymore.
It's the safest place in the world.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.374
I can feel my grace.

19:35.574 --> 19:38.748
It's here, and you've hidden it somehow.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.924
- Where is it?
- Honestly, I have no idea.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.262
Where is it?

19:46.419 --> 19:52.097
Ow! Uhn! I don't know, I swear.
I had another angel hide it, even from me.

19:56.429 --> 20:02.436
You know, in case someone tries
to torture the information out of me.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.274
Case in point.

20:05.671 --> 20:09.778
- Unh.
- Where is my grace?

20:09.942 --> 20:12.855
Ah, I told the angel...

20:13.012 --> 20:17.119
...to hide some clues in some
of my favorite books.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.060
Mother, may I?

20:36.635 --> 20:39.809
"What is the maddest thing a man can do?"

20:40.072 --> 20:42.609
It's a riddle'? What's the answer?

20:42.808 --> 20:45.311
Beats me. I've only been a man a day.

20:45.478 --> 20:49.824
Um, the answer to the riddle
will lead to another book.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.155
And inside that book...

20:52.318 --> 20:54.491
...you'll find your grace.

20:54.653 --> 20:59.602
We're gonna work this out together.
Okay? Teamwork.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.939
Okay, even the Bletchley Circle
couldn't crack this thing.

21:06.132 --> 21:10.444
I've tried every cryptographic
algorithm there is. Goose egg.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.617
Well, maybe that's not such a bad thing.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.681
Those people following you, hmm...

21:16.942 --> 21:22.016
...all kinds of wrong, talking
mum-generational, centuries-old wrong.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.858
The Styne family.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.325
Men of Letters' files have them
dated back to the early 1800s.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.194
They used spells to create disease,
to destabilize markets.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.856
Hell, they even helped the Nazis
before they came into power.

21:32.858 --> 21:35.338
And they profited from all of it.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.330
Yeah.

21:37.496 --> 21:41.467
- So they're like the supernatural DuPonts?
- Basically.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.706
All the spells they used came from
a book of unspeakable evil.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.848
Which they lost near 100 years ago.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.817
Okay, so they're bad. So what?
We've faced worse.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.649
Sam, read the file.

21:53.846 --> 21:57.726
The way the book works is, when you use it,
there is a negative reaction.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.692
I'm talking biblical negative.

21:59.885 --> 22:03.526
Dark magic always comes with a price.
We know that. We've been down that road.

22:03.689 --> 22:07.193
- Let's at least translate it, see what
it says... - You guys don't understand.

22:07.393 --> 22:10.806
That book's been calling to me since
I laid eyes on it. Calling the Mark.

22:10.963 --> 22:15.070
I can hear it like it's alive.
It wants me to use it, but not for good.

22:16.368 --> 22:19.372
Look, I wanted it to be
the answer too, okay? I really did.

22:19.572 --> 22:25.022
We have got to get rid of that. Burn it. Bury it.
We'll have to find another way to fix the Mark.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.648
Like what?

22:29.248 --> 22:30.727
I don't know.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.094
- So, you're giving up?
- No, I'm not giving up.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.927
Charlie, I don't have a death wish. Okay?

22:37.089 --> 22:40.434
Even if I did, I can't die.
Not with this thing on my arm.

22:40.693 --> 22:44.072
But what I can do is I can fight it
as long as I can until...

22:44.263 --> 22:45.867
Until what?

22:46.932 --> 22:49.936
Tell me. Until what, Dean?

22:50.169 --> 22:53.275
Until I watch you become a demon again?
Until then?

22:53.439 --> 22:56.443
I can't do that. I won't do that.

22:58.244 --> 23:02.556
Well, then, you'll just have to lock me up.
Bind me to the bunker like you did last time.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.951
That doesn't solve anything.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.621
Look, just let us translate the book, okay?

23:08.787 --> 23:12.428
If there's a cure, we'll do it
and deal with the consequences later.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.729
I can't lose you.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.433
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.969
You change your mind?
That's not what you said last time.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.070
You know I didn't mean...

23:22.268 --> 23:25.306
This is my cross to bear, Sam. Mine.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.209
And that book is not the answer.

23:29.275 --> 23:33.815
Now, we gotta destroy it before it falls
into the wrong hands, and that includes me.

23:38.817 --> 23:42.264
I'm gonna go for a drive.
Charlie, we forgot to pick up your snacks.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.798
- Dean, look...
- We'll figure out another way.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.496
And, Sam? I'll get my vacation.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.172
But not today.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.172
Not like this.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.504
Sam...

23:56.769 --> 23:58.510
...maybe he's right...
- No.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.281
There's a way to fix. There has to be.

24:01.473 --> 24:04.852
You know, we really do make a good team.

24:05.010 --> 24:07.354
Kind of like a buddy comedy
without the comedy.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.958
- Or the buddies.
- Now, come on.

24:11.150 --> 24:15.292
Back at the diner, that was some
pretty awesome dynamic-duo action.

24:15.487 --> 24:18.525
What we did back there was unfortunate.

24:18.791 --> 24:22.204
No more of our brothers
and sisters should die.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.372
"Brothers and sisters"?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.707
Listen to you.

24:28.867 --> 24:33.714
Still spitting out the company line
like anyone cares, heh.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.713
Like we're actually a family.

24:36.875 --> 24:41.381
When what we really are
are a bunch of glowing lights...

24:41.647 --> 24:46.323
...filled with self-loathing
or delusions of grandeur.

24:46.518 --> 24:47.690
- Or both.
- You shut up.

24:47.886 --> 24:51.561
No. If I'm gonna die, I want answers.

24:51.790 --> 24:55.567
Like who are you now?

24:55.794 --> 24:58.798
You're obviously not an angel of the Lord.

24:58.998 --> 25:04.914
And what about all of this walking the
Earth like Cains from Kung Fur crap?

25:05.838 --> 25:07.374
Cleaning up heaven's messes.

25:07.573 --> 25:11.316
How many more rogue angels
are there out there?

25:11.810 --> 25:16.316
And what are you gonna do
once you're done with all that?

25:16.882 --> 25:19.226
Go back to heaven? Please.

25:20.686 --> 25:25.032
The angel formally known as Hannah
has restored order up top.

25:25.224 --> 25:29.195
Smoothest it's run since God cut the ribbon
on the pearly gates.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.272
So tell me, Castiel...

25:31.430 --> 25:34.934
...truly, what is your mission now?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.376
You shut up and keep looking.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.716
Well, uh...

25:49.348 --> 25:51.794
...cannot say...

25:52.918 --> 25:55.262
...I didn't try.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.747
Poor, Castiel.

26:11.937 --> 26:15.316
Swam so far
just to drown in shallow waters.

26:18.877 --> 26:21.153
Isn't it ironic?

26:21.947 --> 26:23.119
Don't you think?

26:39.465 --> 26:40.910
Pfft.

26:44.336 --> 26:48.944
What did Dean mean
when he said you changed your mind?

26:53.178 --> 26:58.685
So a while back, we had a chance
to, um, close the gates of hell.

27:01.253 --> 27:06.032
And in order to do that,
I would've had to die.

27:06.191 --> 27:09.195
I was okay with that,
and I am okay with that, but Dean was not.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.103
And so he, uh...

27:13.866 --> 27:14.970
He saved you.

27:18.604 --> 27:19.844
Yeah, he saved me.

27:21.673 --> 27:22.845
And let me guess.

27:23.041 --> 27:26.511
In doing so, he did something
you didn't want, and that pissed you off...

27:26.712 --> 27:28.953
...and you said something that hurt him?

27:32.784 --> 27:34.388
Yeah, that sounds about right.

27:36.054 --> 27:37.897
Brothers.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.201
You know...

27:41.393 --> 27:44.237
...I haven't been a hunter for very long...

27:44.496 --> 27:46.533
...but it feels like this is the life.

27:46.732 --> 27:51.010
Mostly ends in
"Sophie's choices," death or tears.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.648
Usually all the above, huh?

27:56.508 --> 28:02.151
How does this become my life? I was gonna
own my own start-up, marry ScarJo...

28:03.048 --> 28:04.925
...invent something cool.

28:05.717 --> 28:07.754
Now I'm just...

28:08.820 --> 28:10.561
I'm just happy to be alive.

28:13.392 --> 28:16.100
You know, when Dean came
to get me at school...

28:16.528 --> 28:18.235
...I told myself:

28:18.764 --> 28:20.937
"One last job." You know?
"One more job."

28:21.166 --> 28:22.543
And...

28:22.734 --> 28:24.771
And then when I, um...

28:26.071 --> 28:30.542
When I lost Jess,
I again told myself, "One more job."

28:31.176 --> 28:34.623
It was always one more job, you know?
And one more job, and one more job.

28:34.846 --> 28:38.760
And then I was gonna go
back to law and to my life.

28:39.585 --> 28:42.122
You were the
Dread Pirate Roberts of hunting.

28:45.691 --> 28:46.965
Yeah.

28:48.927 --> 28:51.806
I guess I really understand now that...

28:54.466 --> 28:55.809
...this is my life.

28:57.135 --> 28:58.273
I love it.

29:00.138 --> 29:02.812
But I can't do it...

29:02.975 --> 29:06.320
...without my brother.
I don't wanna do it without my brother.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.981
And if he's gone, then I don't...

29:10.816 --> 29:13.956
I get it. I do.

29:18.824 --> 29:20.633
All right.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.999
First things first.

29:23.228 --> 29:26.072
Find what I really came here for.

29:30.335 --> 29:35.182
"What two things do you need
to succeed in life?" Heh.

29:38.510 --> 29:42.856
- Ignorance and confidence.
- They're quotes.

29:45.517 --> 29:49.988
So, uh, did you and Samateur hour...

29:50.188 --> 29:53.328
...really think I wouldn't have
a backup plan?

29:56.194 --> 29:58.538
Hello, demon tablet.

30:07.139 --> 30:11.679
The places I'll go with this...

30:17.049 --> 30:18.790
...and your grace.

30:22.854 --> 30:25.232
Well, one out of two ain't bad.

30:25.857 --> 30:28.804
Whats the maddest thing a man can do?

30:29.461 --> 30:31.907
Let himself die.

31:03.061 --> 31:06.599
God just don't build to last, does he?

31:09.101 --> 31:12.241
- Afternoon, sir.
- Howdy.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.463
- There we go.
- That be it for you'?

31:29.621 --> 31:31.032
Yeah. That's it.

31:31.256 --> 31:35.534
Okay then. That'll be 15.75.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.740
You heading home,
or you just passing through?

31:39.431 --> 31:41.240
Just passing through.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.479
Must get awful lonely out here
all by yourself.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.380
Oh, I get by.

31:54.479 --> 31:55.480
Don't move.

31:56.381 --> 31:57.655
Hands where I can see them.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.157
Don't you want your change?

32:04.823 --> 32:06.325
Now...

32:06.992 --> 32:08.835
...who might you be?

32:10.629 --> 32:12.336
Well, hello there.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.842
Where'd a back-road nothing like you
get their hands on that?

32:23.475 --> 32:25.079
What's it to you, Mr. Styne?

32:28.914 --> 32:30.416
My friends call me Jacob.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.086
Well, I ain't your friend.

32:44.029 --> 32:48.341
These wouldn't happen to be treats for
a red-headed little gal, now would they?

32:50.035 --> 32:51.810
Y'all hid the book, didn't you?

32:52.537 --> 32:55.541
Lead-lined little number, I'm betting.

32:56.341 --> 32:58.548
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.520
You don't?

33:03.014 --> 33:05.051
See, that man back there...

33:05.383 --> 33:08.887
...he said the same thing as the others
at truck stops and gas stations...

33:09.054 --> 33:13.560
...up and down the way.
Nobody had seen that red-headed girl.

33:15.393 --> 33:18.067
And then a man bearing that mark...

33:18.330 --> 33:20.207
...comes in here...

33:20.398 --> 33:22.071
...! o me.

33:22.968 --> 33:29.078
Heh. Well, there's coincidence,
and then there's just providence.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.744
You see, the Book of the Damned,
it wants to be found.

33:31.977 --> 33:34.253
It wants to come home.

33:34.412 --> 33:35.482
Let me guess.

33:36.248 --> 33:40.162
You wanna use it
to get that gift off your arm, don't you?

33:43.221 --> 33:46.600
Power is wasted on the weak.

33:47.592 --> 33:50.664
Now, the book...

33:52.764 --> 33:54.402
...can remove that mark.

33:54.933 --> 33:56.435
But you mess around with that...

33:57.269 --> 34:00.250
...you're gonna do
far more harm than good.

34:01.006 --> 34:05.455
So why don't you do the right thing here,
boy, and tell me where that book is.

34:14.252 --> 34:15.958
One more time. I didn't hear you.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.398
I said...

34:57.963 --> 35:01.638
- What's going on?
- The Stynes. They found me.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.287
- Those douches are all jacked up.
- What're you talking about?

35:11.443 --> 35:14.253
I emptied a clip into one of them
before the bitch went down.

35:14.412 --> 35:16.517
What're you doing with the holy oil?

35:20.752 --> 35:23.494
There is a cure for the Mark in the book.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.358
But it comes at a price.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.032
We gotta destroy it.

35:29.260 --> 35:32.173
- Are you sure about this?
- It's calling to me, Sam.

35:32.364 --> 35:36.335
Okay. I can hear it. It's calling to the
Mark. It wants me to take the book and run.

35:38.503 --> 35:39.709
Burn it now.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.014
Sam, burn it. Now.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.558
You silly boy.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.704
I was foolish. Selfish.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.137
I should've just killed him.

37:14.299 --> 37:17.803
- Who knows what he'll do with that tablet.
- You know what, Cass?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.946
You got your grace back.

37:20.138 --> 37:21.947
You're back.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.279
You did the right thing.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.949
You did the right thing.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.587
That book needed to be destroyed.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.159
We will find another way, Sam.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.128
We're back, bitches.

37:45.463 --> 37:48.171
Whoa, is that who I think it is?

37:48.333 --> 37:50.609
Charlie, Cass. Cass, Charlie.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.672
I thought you'd be shorter.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.645
I'm gonna get these to the fridge.

38:00.645 --> 38:05.355
- Heard you got your mojo back.
- Yes, my grace, it's been restored.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.530
So can't you just...

38:08.686 --> 38:11.166
...you know, cure Dean?

38:12.490 --> 38:14.436
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.371
Never is, is it?

38:21.800 --> 38:24.474
Do you think you could do anything
about my carpal tunnel? Heh.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.020
- Is that it?
- Your carpal tunnel...

38:35.213 --> 38:37.853
...and your bullet wound are now healed.

38:38.049 --> 38:41.030
You may wanna continue wearing
your wrist brace at night though.

38:41.219 --> 38:42.527
Did we just become best friends?

38:43.888 --> 38:46.391
Hey, look who decided to show.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.565
So?

38:51.963 --> 38:53.203
You back?

38:53.398 --> 38:54.900
Hundred percent?

38:55.166 --> 38:56.736
How did that happen?

38:59.737 --> 39:01.580
Um, it was Hannah.

39:01.739 --> 39:06.085
She managed to get the location of
the remainder of my grace out of Metatron.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.987
Awesome.

39:09.214 --> 39:11.251
I told you we were due for a win.

39:12.717 --> 39:13.991
Good to have you back, pal.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.136
I don't trust you.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.145
And...

40:07.372 --> 40:08.749
...I never will.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.486
But I need help.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.816
And this is right in your wheelhouse.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.987
Sam, burn it. Now.

40:46.577 --> 40:48.352
You silly boy.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.364
My family will never
stop looking for that book.

41:07.198 --> 41:11.544
I need the Mark of Cain off of my brother.

41:12.203 --> 41:14.547
And something tells me...

41:14.872 --> 41:17.443
...you can crack this book...

41:18.042 --> 41:20.181
...and find that cure.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.552
The only question is...

41:24.682 --> 41:26.457
...will you help me?

41:34.192 --> 41:36.729
Shall we discuss terms?
