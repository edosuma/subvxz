WEBVTT

01:19.520 --> 01:21.101
ROSS: Mr Vercoe.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.066
Cap'n Poldark.

01:23.240 --> 01:27.028
- May I ask where these men are headed?
- Truro Gaol, sir.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.781
And their crime?

01:28.960 --> 01:31.747
Importing goods
without paying the required duty.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.467
Some call it "Free Trading".

01:33.640 --> 01:36.063
Some ca||_it _ _
the only way to afford life's necessrtles.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.585
Brandy? Gin? These essentials, are they?

01:39.760 --> 01:41.102
Salt is.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.622
'Tis my duty to enforce the law, Cap'n.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.580
Your commitment is heartwarming.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.181
Move out'a.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.186
Shouldn't rile 'im.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.986
Couldn't resist.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.861
I'm wanted at the mine.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.701
I have fuses to set.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.745
And you'd abandon me?

02:09.920 --> 02:11.899
Suppose I met a footpad on the way home?

02:12.080 --> 02:13.866
God help him.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.979
(Gulls crying)

02:40.240 --> 02:42.219
(Distant explosion)

02:44.120 --> 02:45.701
(Coughing)

02:48.200 --> 02:49.906
Still not through?

02:50.080 --> 02:51.547
Can't be far off.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.065
Can almost smell Trevorgie,
t'other side ofthat ironstone.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.105
Another blast should do the trick.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.068
- Will the shareholders keep faith with us?
- They're sensible men, most ofthem.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.825
And I intend to make a robust argument.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.864
So...we carry on?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.181
We carry on.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.099
(Grunting)

03:15.080 --> 03:17.822
- They've broken through?
- Almost.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.064
Ross Poldark is tenacious.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.821
(Grunting)

03:23.000 --> 03:25.582
Ultimately, I expect Wheal Leisure
to do very well for me.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.069
Well, why else would 'ee buy shares in it?

03:29.520 --> 03:31.385
On whose land does Wheal Leisure sit?

03:31.560 --> 03:33.425
Who is its main shareholder?

03:33.600 --> 03:36.785
And his latest scheme
is about to come to fruition.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.144
- It's just too easy.
- (Grunting)

03:40.400 --> 03:42.106
Were you hurt in the blast?

03:42.280 --> 03:45.625
'Tis bruisin' I have all the time,
swelling too, same as Ted.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.308
Sir.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.505
- What is it?
- Like a plague, Ross.

03:52.680 --> 03:56.229
- Halfthe mine's afflicted.
- Halfthe village beside.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.581
Should we send these men home?

03:59.760 --> 04:01.899
They can't afford to lose their pitches.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.220
Well, they won't, of course, but we need them fit.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.181
Get Dwight Enys.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.380
Dwight Enys is a scoundrel.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.705
For all he knows, I might be dead.

04:14.880 --> 04:19.340
I think I would have informed him,
had that been the case.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.099
CAROLINE: "DrEnys,
having saved my life some months ago,

04:26.280 --> 04:28.783
you appearto have
no further interest in my recovery.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.508
I would nonetheless esteem it a favour
If you would call

04:31.680 --> 04:35.741
to assure yourself of my full recovery
and to receive payment for your skill.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.787
Unless, of course,
you have more important matters to attend."

04:38.960 --> 04:40.348
Lift your head up.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.862
(Coughing)

04:42.040 --> 04:43.667
Show me your teeth.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.426
I can't account for these symptoms.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.501
Swelling, bruising, bleeding gums,
listlessness...

04:53.680 --> 04:55.739
Is it the dust? The foul air ofthe mine?

04:55.920 --> 04:58.741
I wondered that,
but some ofthese people are fisherfolk.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.380
It's perplexing.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.539
(Coughing)

05:08.400 --> 05:10.345
(Hums merrily)

05:14.000 --> 05:16.548
The summer and the May, oh

05:16.720 --> 05:19.268
For winter is a-come, oh...

05:21.120 --> 05:22.462
Is that wise...

05:22.640 --> 05:24.949
with the current so strong hereabouts?

05:25.120 --> 05:26.667
I know 'em well enough.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.944
Will Ross be happy?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.667
He'll be happy wi' these.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.705
And who's to tell him where I got 'em?

05:48.960 --> 05:53.181
- How long will Jud be gone?
- Don't talk to me ofthat slinkin' g'eat lurker.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.820
Any excuse to shirk his chores an' study
the inside 0' Sally Chill-off's kiddley.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.501
"Keeping 'is head down," he says.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.545
I'll keep 'is head down!

06:08.160 --> 06:10.219
Could someone have caused the bruises?

06:10.400 --> 06:13.107
She says they come oftheir own accord,
but how?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.740
I can't fathom it.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.741
Is it Paludal fever? Is it purpura?

06:19.800 --> 06:24.499
I've tried...fresh air, sunlight,
goat's milk, nutmeg...

06:24.680 --> 06:27.228
Perhaps what I should try is
a different profession.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.981
The navy, perhaps?

06:30.040 --> 06:31.621
You'd enjoy ships' rations -

06:31.800 --> 06:34.109
salt pork, dried biscuit, weevils...

06:34.280 --> 06:36.908
No doubt and be all the healthier for it.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.025
Of course.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.827
What?

06:43.480 --> 06:46.062
Biscuit, salt, no fresh fruit, no green vegetables.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.065
I thank you, Ross.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.707
What for?

06:50.880 --> 06:52.984
Helping me diagnose the complaint.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.786
Scurw.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.664
Cap'n Poldark, sir?

07:02.960 --> 07:04.939
Thank you, sir.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.788
Dwight, this just came for you...

07:11.680 --> 07:13.466
..from Killewarren.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.104
(Horse whinnies)

07:38.280 --> 07:40.987
You seem in haste, George.
Have you urgent business afoot?

07:41.160 --> 07:44.027
- All my business is urgent.
- Including your assault-by-proxy?

07:44.200 --> 07:46.623
- Excuse me? _
- My servant, a Witness at the trial,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.189
- was attacked and left for dead.
- How IS that my concern?

07:49.360 --> 07:54.741
Only that it would be a mistake to imagine such
intimidation could continue to be one-sided.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.899
Is that a threat, Ross? Is it?

08:25.440 --> 08:27.419
(Cockerel crows)

08:32.560 --> 08:35.108
Las' night in Sawle,
they say another drop was ambushed.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.022
More cargo lost
and four more sent to Bodmin Gaol.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.789
Since the riots in Bodmin,
the district's been crawling wi' soldiers.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.906
They'm clean out of salt
from Padstowe to St Ives.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.298
It do bode ill for when the shoals come in.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.823
- Fish won't keep.
- Fish won't sell.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.978
JINNY: Mam says if it weren't for Mr Ross...

09:03.120 --> 09:05.338
Where are these from?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.261
Nampara Cove.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.142
You went out in the boat?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.709
No, I whistled and they came a-dancin'
out the waves.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.019
Have you no sense?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.861
Yes and an extra mouth to feed.

09:18.040 --> 09:22.101
Then at least do the courtesy of
taking more care of yourself in future.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.980
I won't be home late.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.741
(Door opens)

09:29.480 --> 09:30.947
(Door slams)

09:35.240 --> 09:37.105
AUNT AGATHA: What's that contraption?

09:37.280 --> 09:41.899
ELIZABETH: A Virgula divinitoria.
It's believed to sniff out metal.

09:42.080 --> 09:47.029
AUNT AGATHA: Since they reconciled, I was
hoping Francis would look to Ross for guidance.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.020
Mm.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.901
That upstart Warleggan hasn't called of late.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.741
He and Francis have quarrelled.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.909
I wonder he doesn't call in your loans.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.299
Perhaps he has another plan.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.945
Such as?

10:04.120 --> 10:06.543
Should I know how the Devil's mind works?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.547
You'd better keep him sweet.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.348
Perhaps you should pay him a visit.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.379
I've no influence over George.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.907
I've summoned Dr_ Choake
to come and VISIt you.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.189
I find myself in excellent health, thank you, Aunt,

10:24.360 --> 10:27.500
and I will improve further when we have
a working mine to our name

10:27.680 --> 10:30.660
and are no longer reliant on Warleggan charity.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.264
Little Verity should be here.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.419
She'd know what to do.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.459
- Will you join me aboard next week?
- People will think me a bad wife,

10:44.640 --> 10:47.382
always gallivanting off
and sunning myself in Lisbon.

10:47.560 --> 10:51.109
That makes you a good wife,
for acceding to your husband's wishes.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.181
I think they are yours too.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.339
- You know they are.
- (Chuckles)

10:58.120 --> 10:59.985
I've had word from James.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.299
- Oh?
- His ship was diverted to Penang.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.347
- And Esther?
- Remains with her governess in Plymouth.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.978
But, when James returns,
they will both come and visit us.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.459
I shall insist.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.744
Do you ever think the price was too high?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.660
Your children shun us.
My brother disowns us.

11:25.080 --> 11:29.062
Well, we have at least one friend,
to whom we owe everything.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.347
Of course we're happy.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.385
I could not be more so.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.266
And yet?

11:37.440 --> 11:41.308
My brother will not forgive me
and Andrew's children decline to meet me.

11:41.480 --> 11:42.947
Not that I blame them.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.862
I've replaced their dear, departed mother.
They must hate me.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.463
- When they meet you...
- I fear that will never happen.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.622
Ifthey will not accept me, how much worse will
it be ifAndrew and I have a child of our own?

11:52.800 --> 11:54.461
Are you...?

11:54.640 --> 11:56.346
No. Not yet.

11:56.520 --> 12:00.422
But children are the natural consequence
of marriage, are they not?

12:00.600 --> 12:02.579
It would appear so.

12:13.640 --> 12:17.428
DWIGHT: "Dear Madam, I am happy to hear
of your recovery but be assured, as to payment,

12:17.600 --> 12:20.228
I am amply recompensed by
the knowledge of your gratitude".

12:22.400 --> 12:26.461
"To you, Dr Enys, no doubt the saving of my life
seems a very small service.

12:26.640 --> 12:31.509
To me, it assumes a slightly greater
significance. I therefore enclose a guinea,

12:31.680 --> 12:36.504
which is the smallest value, little as I esteem
myself, that I could put upon your services.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.819
Be so kind as to attend me today".

12:39.760 --> 12:42.866
Do you think Elizabeth
could ever be persuaded to meet me here?

12:43.040 --> 12:45.179
Even for half an hour? With Geoffrey Charles?

12:45.360 --> 12:48.944
Would she do that behind Francis's back?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.582
No, she would never.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.259
But I do miss them so terribly.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.067
(Verity sighs)

13:13.920 --> 13:16.741
You see. He will never be reconciled.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.305
(Door opens)

13:20.480 --> 13:22.061
Dr Enys.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.869
How kind of you to call.
I haven't been waiting above three months.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.544
I apologise, Miss Penvenen.
I've been busy with my other patients.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.938
Doubtless they're more important than I.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.503
Only insofar as
their conditions are more serious.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.981
Well?

13:44.160 --> 13:46.788
Are you going to examine my throat or not?

13:59.080 --> 14:01.059
Open your mouth, please.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.859
Wider, please.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.909
Most satisfactory.
You'll have no further trouble.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.059
How brusque you are today.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.229
Is your friend Ross Poldark so peremptory?

14:29.760 --> 14:33.469
He has little time for pleasantries,
ifthat's what you mean.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.619
Do you ride, Dr Enys?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.461
For pleasure, that is?

14:37.640 --> 14:42.509
I'm sure you'll appreciate I have very little time
when I'm taken up with...

14:42.680 --> 14:44.898
More serious complaints.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.786
So, tell me, what are they?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.704
Scrofula, phthisis, scurvy.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.940
- What can be done for them?
- For scrofula, nothing.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.339
For er...scurw, a doctor's drugs are useless,

14:56.520 --> 15:00.581
but simple foods - green vegetables, fresh fruit -
can effect an almost immediate cure.

15:00.760 --> 15:05.902
But...these are precisely what
the poor cannot afford, so they bleed and die.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.625
Why do they not spend less on gin
and more on oranges?

15:10.800 --> 15:12.381
Oranges?

15:13.360 --> 15:15.783
Oranges, when they can be had,
cost thruppence apiece.

15:15.960 --> 15:19.020
Gin costs less than sixpence a quart,
yet many are as sober as you or I.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.259
Will you do any good,
attempting to save these people?

15:21.440 --> 15:24.307
They will only multiply
and then there'll be more mouths to feed.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.701
Of course, it's sad to see them die,
but at least it keeps the numbers in check.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.628
Do I shock you?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.179
Only by your assumption that
you will not be included in this stocktaking.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.861
But of course I won't.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.259
I'm a Penvenen, so I'm rich and privileged.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.469
Would you excuse me, madam?
My patients require me.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.467
I shall take the liberty of returning your fee.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.385
You consider yourselftainted by it?

15:57.440 --> 15:59.101
I bid you good day.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.387
(Indistinct chatter)

16:15.800 --> 16:18.985
ROSS: Gentlemen, we have good news
to report. Mr Henshawe?

16:19.160 --> 16:22.823
Our latest excavations
have taken us through to what we calculate

16:23.000 --> 16:25.901
to be feet from the old Trevorgie copper lode.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.981
Now, I'm aware
this has taken longer than we'd hoped,

16:29.160 --> 16:33.506
but it is my beliefthat
the next blast will see us break through.

16:33.680 --> 16:39.346
So it only remains for us to secure your approval
to divert this quarter's profits for the last time.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.545
One final push.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.824
Do we have everyone's agreement?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.548
- Eight weeks?
- Yes.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.860
Beyond your wildest estimate,
and you're still not through?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.508
Ironstone is no respecter oftime or money.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.547
But we, as shareholders, must be, surely?

16:55.720 --> 16:59.099
Each quarter, we've seen our profits
diverted into a scheme

16:59.280 --> 17:01.589
which has so far yielded precisely nothing.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.420
Optimism's one thing,

17:04.600 --> 17:08.468
but what ifyou've got your bearings wrong
and bypassed the old workings altogether?

17:08.640 --> 17:11.427
No man in these parts knows the workings
better than Captain Henshawe.

17:11.600 --> 17:17.903
But if he's wrong,
you might dig on for years and never connect.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.466
HENSHAWE: I say we put it to a vote.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.584
All those in favour of continuing?

17:28.440 --> 17:29.702
All those against?

17:32.360 --> 17:34.180
Motion to continue denied.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.147
Shall we close the meeting?

17:38.320 --> 17:41.585
- There's nothing further to report.
- One moment, sir.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.786
You will no doubt have noted
the absence of Mr Renfrew?

17:44.960 --> 17:50.102
As of yesterday, he is no longer a shareholder,
having sold his shares to me.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.987
GEORGE: Was he furious?

17:55.160 --> 17:56.707
Not with me.

17:57.520 --> 18:01.263
But then he knows
I am not the actual owner ofthe shares.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.101
(Horse whinnies)

18:24.000 --> 18:26.059
You pass my house without paying a call?

18:26.240 --> 18:29.949
- How have I offended you?
- As I think you know, George, since the trial...

18:30.120 --> 18:32.020
The trial? Is that not behind us now?

18:32.200 --> 18:35.909
Cannot we move forward,
rekindle our former connection?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.344
- I'm not sure how possible that...
- Please.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.707
At least return with me
and take some refreshment.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.669
Mm.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.948
- Mr Trencrom.
- Cap'n Poldark.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.025
What can I do for you, Mr Trencrom?

19:13.200 --> 19:16.067
May a man not call, in neighbourly fashion,

19:16.240 --> 19:21.018
enquire after your affairs,
see how they prosper, speak a little of his own?

19:21.200 --> 19:23.145
Suppose you speak first of yours...

19:24.200 --> 19:28.102
..so I may come to a quicker understanding
ofyour interest in mine?

19:28.280 --> 19:29.986
(Trencrom chuckles)

19:50.120 --> 19:52.668
I'm sad you've declined my invitations of late.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.705
We decline all invitations.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.747
We simply cannot afford to return the hospitality.

19:57.920 --> 20:01.788
May I venture to suggest
that I am a "special case"?

20:03.040 --> 20:09.548
And, difficult as things are at Trenwith, they
could, I'm sure you realise, be so much worse.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.699
And if Francis cannot say so, allow me
to convey the thanks ofthe entire family.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.265
Not the entire family, surely?

20:22.480 --> 20:25.825
MR TRENCROM:
My affairs do far from prosper.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.982
Oh, business is brisk,
as far as consumption goes.

20:30.160 --> 20:34.108
- The difﬁculty comes with the supply.
- So I hear.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.384
What do you hear?

20:36.560 --> 20:40.985
That the _customs officials at St Ann's
are determined to let nothing sllp ashore.

20:41.160 --> 20:46.063
And that all your attempts to persuade them with
a share ofthe profits have fallen on deaf ears.

20:46.240 --> 20:52.543
And now this crackdown from on high means
that every time we find a new landing place,

20:52.720 --> 20:54.585
we're met by gaugers and military.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.422
All cargo confiscated.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.148
Crew barely 'scaped with their lives.

21:00.320 --> 21:04.700
So here's the thing...
we've run out of navigable inlets.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.508
And I possess the only one for miles.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.980
Actually, I expect to be seeing
a good deal of Ross in future.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.902
- I've increased my shareholding in his mine.
- Oh.

21:17.080 --> 21:20.299
So I hope I won't have cause
to inflict undue pressure on him.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.108
Or on Francis, for that matter.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.699
What might cause you to?

21:28.080 --> 21:29.786
I wonder.

21:34.120 --> 21:40.423
Your cove is not ideal,
but we could land there safely on still nights.

21:41.440 --> 21:46.025
I'd handle the distribution.
All you'd need to do is draw your curtains.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.464
And what do you think
would induce me to do so?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.107
Ross...

21:50.280 --> 21:53.864
We could discuss a lump sum per cargo.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.899
How does 50 sound?

21:57.080 --> 21:58.547
(Chuckles)

21:58.720 --> 22:00.665
I see you've not lost your sense of humour.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.786
(Laughs) Is that such a poor offer?

22:03.960 --> 22:05.825
What would you suggest?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.547
200 per cargo.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.029
- Ross... _
- My dear srr.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.465
Impossible.
Make the journey almost without profit.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.744
- Not to mention salt.
- Salt?

22:15.920 --> 22:17.945
There's less profit in salt than tea or brandy.

22:18.120 --> 22:21.465
Less call for it,
among my more genteel customers.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.507
200 per cargo and six casks of salt.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.864
That's my price. Take it or leave it.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.860
(Trencrom exhales sharply)

22:32.960 --> 22:34.939
What is it you seek, George?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.865
Your friendship.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.619
A renewal of our former intimacy.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.789
A gradual...increase in it.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.186
Is that too much too ask?

22:57.600 --> 22:59.909
Particularly if it safeguards those you love?

23:17.240 --> 23:18.389
(Trencrom chuckles)

23:25.160 --> 23:29.142
I do not believe Francis would be happy
about my visiting here ofen...

23:30.200 --> 23:31.861
..if at all.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.901
A pity.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.146
A very great pity.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.539
200, for letting tub-carriers use our cove?

24:15.720 --> 24:18.462
- That won't buy you out of prison.
- I don't intend to be there.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.301
I can't stand it again.

24:20.480 --> 24:24.541
The frettin', the not sleepin', the picturin' you
a-hangin' at Bargus Crossroads.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.188
Were we not in dire straits, I wouldn't do it.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.227
Today I learned that George
has bought up more ofWheal Leisure.

24:30.400 --> 24:34.746
With 200, we can keep our heads above water
and Sawle can salt its pilchards.

24:35.520 --> 24:40.469
Why is it fine for you to run risks when
I may not even take a boat out in calm waters?

24:41.280 --> 24:45.421
Believe me, I have every intention
of keeping on the right side ofthe law.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.466
Or at least the blind side.

24:59.120 --> 25:02.226
'Tis a cryin' shame
we stopped the tunnel to Trevorgie.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.187
In my bones, I could feel we were close.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.180
- Where do you estimate we'd got to?
- Well...

25:13.400 --> 25:15.539
..nigh-on that clump 0' trees.

25:15.720 --> 25:19.941
- Halfway towards Wheal Grace?
- I'd say so. Your father's old mine.

25:20.120 --> 25:24.307
It's never occurred to me till now _
how close It IS to the old Trevorgie workings.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.344
Reckon 'twouldn't hurt to take a closer look
at Trevorgie from that end.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.220
Mebbe the old men found a way through
that we know nothin' of.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.381
Is that what Mark meant...

25:40.440 --> 25:41.862
..the night he went away to France?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.667
There's money in that mine.

25:44.680 --> 25:46.147
Coppen

25:46.320 --> 25:47.981
I never see'd a more keenly lode.

25:48.160 --> 25:52.187
- You think he wandered into Trevorgie?
- Could he?

25:53.360 --> 25:56.340
- But if it's all under water...
- With no way of draining it.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.346
..we'd need one ofthem
new-fangled pumping-engines.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.499
Which cost.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.301
Let me think on it.

26:10.480 --> 26:13.586
If I decide to take it any further,
I'll come back to you.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.458
- What are you up to?
- Daydreaming.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.741
Wheal Grace?

26:54.200 --> 26:56.179
You don't intend to resurrect her?

26:57.960 --> 26:59.825
If my finances ever match my ambitions.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.467
(Chuckles)

27:01.640 --> 27:03.221
The curse ofthe Poldarks.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.499
Plenty of one, none ofthe other.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.424
Dr Enys, are you now a peddler?

27:17.600 --> 27:22.105
They're for my patients. When these are gone,
there'll be nothing till next harvest.

27:22.280 --> 27:26.899
- Do your patients enjoy worms and mould?
- Beggars cannot be choosers.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.787
(Indistinct shouting)

27:42.000 --> 27:45.060
Almonds, sugar, oranges and chocolate.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.743
- You spoil me.
- May I not? (Chuckles)

27:49.080 --> 27:50.945
But, in fact, it is not all for you.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.623
The sugar is for James,
the chocolates are for Esther.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.745
They come in a month. Are you happy now?

27:55.920 --> 27:58.502
Yes, of course.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.299
Ah, Caroline.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.465
This from Unwin.

28:09.640 --> 28:15.146
Pressing the subject of an engagement.
Now he's an MP...

28:15.320 --> 28:17.823
His coffers need to keep pace
with his ambitions?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.945
Oh, for shame, Caroline.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.544
One must not assume mercenary motives.

28:23.720 --> 28:28.225
I dearly hope that both of you
are marrying for love.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.025
(Laughs) You think Unwin loves me?

28:31.200 --> 28:32.667
You do not?

28:32.840 --> 28:34.944
I think he loves my 20,000.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.463
Oh, I will be sorry to think so.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.578
Does it not strike you as odd?

28:43.400 --> 28:45.743
I'm an heiress, yet I have no money of my own.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.581
- Suppose you give me some?
- Well...

28:48.760 --> 28:51.024
1-1 have no objection
to advancing you something

28:51.200 --> 28:53.384
but, in all the day, what will you spend it on?

28:53.560 --> 28:55.824
I mean, your every need is catered for here.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.467
- 50?
- How much?

28:57.640 --> 29:00.825
What's the use of being rich,
if one can't have a flutter now and then?

29:01.720 --> 29:03.620
Caroline.

29:03.800 --> 29:07.349
You know I disapprove of gaming.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.265
But this would be a new type of gambling,
Uncle.

29:11.440 --> 29:16.139
It appeals to me
and I have a fancy to indulge the whim.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.545
I saw Ross.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.621
- Was he well?
- He's consrderlng a new venture.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.620
Ofwhat nature?

29:32.800 --> 29:35.587
Mining, of course. What else?

29:36.640 --> 29:40.189
Whether we like it or not, it's in our blood.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.899
Right. Come on, boy.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.307
Shall we go see ifwe can strike luclq? (Grunts)

29:59.280 --> 30:02.386
HENSHAWE: How far is it?
ZACKY: Quarter of a mile.

30:02.560 --> 30:06.508
HENSHAWE: Give me a shovel,
I'll dig it myself and be back in time for supper.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.501
- (Laughter)
PRUDIE: Someone's full ofthe joys of spring.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.580
Always is when he's up and doin'.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.944
'Tis sittin' still he can't abide.

30:15.120 --> 30:18.749
ROSS: This section's mostly shallow.
The lower levels are flooded.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.387
We'd surely need an engine.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.427
- Those two young engineers in Redruth...
- Trevithick and Bull?

30:23.600 --> 30:25.909
- They've some interesting new ideas.
- At a price.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.060
And we don't yet know
ifthere's ore enough to make it worthwhile.

30:29.240 --> 30:33.665
Is it worth the risk?
We have these samples, this map, Mark's word.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.660
Your pigheadedness.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.341
- And against that?
- Ah.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.307
- Time? Money? Common sense?
- (Laughter)

30:44.320 --> 30:46.584
Is it a secret or can we all be told?

30:46.760 --> 30:48.421
All in good time.

30:49.680 --> 30:55.027
But, for tonight, draw the curtains early
and ignore any sounds outside.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.542
And where will you be?

30:57.520 --> 31:00.546
- Taking delivery ofthe cargo.
- Ross, you cannot.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.904
- Already arranged.
- Dis-arrange it!

31:43.520 --> 31:45.499
ROSS: Here they come.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.181
(Whispers) So far, so good.

32:18.360 --> 32:21.909
TED: (Softly) So I should hope.
Who else could know about this?

32:22.080 --> 32:24.708
Yet the other landings
up the coast were surprised.

32:24.880 --> 32:28.702
- Mr Trencrom did advise us to trust no one.
CHARLIE: Keep the horse straight.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.701
(Whispers) Gaugers.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.499
PAUL: (Whispers) How many?

32:50.280 --> 32:51.702
Just the one.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.026
Vercoe.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.699
- I'll head him off.
- Nay, Ross.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.939
If he sees you, you're as good as hanged.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.221
It's clear. Let's go.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.343
(Barks)

33:23.800 --> 33:26.906
Ifthey varmints come troaching
across our flower-beds, I'll...

33:27.080 --> 33:29.059
(Gate latch clicks)

33:29.240 --> 33:31.219
(Door closes)

33:35.680 --> 33:37.625
(Approaching footsteps)

33:37.800 --> 33:39.506
(Door opens)

33:45.360 --> 33:46.941
It's over.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.141
Is it?

33:57.360 --> 34:01.103
Demelza, try to see this in a rational light.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.305
I'm home.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.460
The tide is high.
There's no footprints on the beach.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.779
There'll be salt for the pilchards.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.020
And we are 200 less in debt
than we were this morning.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.907
- Is it not a cause to celebrate?
- That you go against my Wishes?

34:15.080 --> 34:17.867
- For the good of us both.
- That you take risks you need not take?

34:18.040 --> 34:20.543
_- On this occasion...
- You think you can do as you please,

34:20.720 --> 34:22.585
while I always do as you bid me?

34:22.760 --> 34:24.341
Well, think again!

34:26.800 --> 34:28.267
(Door slams)

34:35.280 --> 34:37.384
Well, my love?
The Thunderer docks at noon.

34:37.560 --> 34:41.747
I'll collect James, then meet Esther off
the Plymouth coach and be with you by two.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.820
Do not make yourself uneasy.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.058
They will adore you as much as I do.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.584
Thank you so much.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.619
Miss Penvenen?

35:02.800 --> 35:05.303
- Captain Poldark.
- Are you lost?

35:05.480 --> 35:08.301
- Do I look it?
- You're far from home.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.584
Perhaps I enjoy my own company.

35:10.760 --> 35:14.139
You should make the most of it.
I hear you're to be married soon.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.220
Do you recommend the estate?

35:17.040 --> 35:18.940
When both parties agree.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.985
We cannot all follow our hearts.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.139
Surely an heiress can?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.940
What an amusing idea.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.706
Excuse me, I'm late for the hunt.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.545
Ross. Is it you I have to thank for this windfall?

35:38.720 --> 35:40.585
What is it?

35:40.760 --> 35:42.227
Oranges.

35:46.040 --> 35:49.419
I think we both know
I am not your mysterious benefactor.

35:56.760 --> 35:57.909
Oranges.

35:58.080 --> 36:02.267
IfI made you a gift, it would be a better
instrument for removing fish bones.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.182
You bruised my mouth with your fingers,
remember?

36:07.360 --> 36:10.909
I knew it was you. I'm very grateful.
They'll be life-saving.

36:11.080 --> 36:15.301
Good heavens. You don't imagine I care
about the fate of a few fishwives, do you?

36:16.840 --> 36:18.819
You wouldn't take my guinea.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.541
So...?

36:21.720 --> 36:25.668
I knew your conscience wouldn't let you
refuse a gif for your starving patients.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.549
So you see, now you're under obligation to me.

36:32.520 --> 36:33.987
(Chuckles)

36:34.160 --> 36:36.867
Is that where you prefer your men?

36:39.640 --> 36:41.380
You're rather impertinent.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.584
I like you very much too.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.947
(Approaching footsteps)

36:48.120 --> 36:50.145
Oh, there you are, Caroline.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.824
The fox escaped us but er...Dr Enys.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.822
Dr Enys,
I-I hear you're rather good at curing dogs.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.742
Did you notice Horace has
a little spot on his ear?

37:00.920 --> 37:02.182
Has he?

37:02.360 --> 37:05.147
Perhaps Dr Enys might take a look at it
after we've gone?

37:06.400 --> 37:09.949
For 12 bags of oranges,
he shall have the best attention I can give him.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.821
(Indistinct chatter)

37:26.520 --> 37:29.546
HENSHAWE: Do we wait for Mr Tankard?
- He knows the time ofthe meeting.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.665
Proceed, Mr Henshawe.

37:31.840 --> 37:35.298
Last month,
we sent two parcels of red copper to auction.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.539
This month we'll have two, maybe three.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.826
The question is, do we take on extra men,

37:41.000 --> 37:44.060
aside from those back on tribute
smce the closmg ofthe tunnels?

37:44.240 --> 37:48.188
Mr Tankard is not here,
so we must take a vote without him.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.827
Gentlemen, sh...

37:50.000 --> 37:51.900
Forgive my tardiness.

37:52.080 --> 37:56.949
The fox led us a merry dance,
but we got him in the end.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.347
Er... You were expecting Mr Tankard?

38:01.520 --> 38:02.942
He will no longer attend.

38:03.120 --> 38:09.741
I feel, as a principal shareholder, it befits me
to take a more robust interest from now on.

38:10.840 --> 38:16.460
Perhaps you will kindly outline your suggestions
and I shall give them my best consideration.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.946
What do it mean?

39:02.040 --> 39:05.544
It means we cannot move an inch
wrthout hIS say-so.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.586
Nothin' to be done.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.381
Or is there?

39:22.880 --> 39:24.347
If you wish.

39:24.520 --> 39:28.707
And you will demand the very highest price.
I know for certain George will pay.

39:29.760 --> 39:31.625
I think it's for the best.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.667
Indeed, had you done so a year ago...

39:36.560 --> 39:39.905
Still, not too late to pay off your debts
and start afresh.

39:40.080 --> 39:43.504
Very true, but that's not in fact
how I intend to use the money.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.904
Ross, it's good to see you.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.342
Is Francis here?

39:59.520 --> 40:02.387
- Yes, he's...
- Ah. I thought I heard your voice.

40:03.440 --> 40:06.659
- Is this a social call?
- Not exactly.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.307
What?

40:17.480 --> 40:19.141
I'm opening Wheal Grace.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.428
- You don't mean it?
- Yes.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.988
That's cheerful news.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.584
Henshawe and I have been down. _
The lower level's flooded, we need an engine,

40:27.760 --> 40:30.308
but there's enough ore
in the shallows to get us through.

40:30.480 --> 40:34.621
- Who's investing the money?
- I've sold half my shares in Wheal Leisure.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.665
I can realise 600.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.580
- 600?
- Yes.

40:38.760 --> 40:44.744
Erm...you've told me more than once
about the money you've put by.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.342
Yes.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.148
With 1 ,200, we could do a great deal.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.903
- You're suggesting we go into partnership?
- Yes.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.787
ROSS: It's a risk, in more ways than one.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.667
- George has a long arm.
- To hell with George.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.946
- And you could well lose your money.
- Well, I like a gamble.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.068
One can gamble on a man as well as a mine.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.459
Well, I can't guarantee the mine.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.944
Well, ifthat's how you feel,
let's shake hands on it.

41:26.720 --> 41:30.986
Ross, before you take this forward,
there are certain things I should tell you.

41:31.160 --> 41:32.741
Past things?

41:35.760 --> 41:37.739
And I shouldn't feel that I could...

41:39.600 --> 41:43.582
- ..proceed unless you were fully apprised of...
- If it's the past, let's forget it.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.105
I don't think I want to hear it.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.460
Well, ifthat's the case,
I don't think I want to hear it myself.

41:51.640 --> 41:57.180
To the Poldarks.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.703
- Mr Ross won' like it.
- Mr Ross won't be told, will he?

42:19.480 --> 42:21.061
No, mistress.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.739
(Knock on door)

42:31.800 --> 42:33.028
I'm Esther.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.264
Oh. Oh, my dear. You've come too soon.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.819
No, I meant...
I did not expect you till this afternoon.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.501
I came on the early coach.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.148
- Is my father here?
- He's gone to meet your brother.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.867
Won't you come in?

42:46.040 --> 42:49.020
Oh, my dear, it's...
it's so good to meet you at last.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.867
Will itjust be the two of you?

42:55.040 --> 42:57.099
- No other shareholders?
- None whatsoever.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.339
There is one further point.

43:00.600 --> 43:03.706
I wish my shares in the mine
to be vested in my son's name.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.541
But he's still a child, isn't he?

43:05.720 --> 43:08.507
Yes, but if George Warrlegan learns
of our partnership,

43:08.680 --> 43:10.659
he may try to get at Ross through me.

43:11.720 --> 43:14.348
But ifthe shares belong to Geoffrey Charles,

43:14.520 --> 43:16.659
well, then George cannot touch them.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.501
As you wish.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.822
I've a fancy to buy a nosegay for Elizabeth.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.343
Shall we meet at the Red Lion
then ride home together?

43:32.520 --> 43:34.306
By all means.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.501
(Dog barking)

44:00.120 --> 44:05.103
You may be interested to know I've just
purchased more shares in Wheal Leisure.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.866
I wish you joy ofthem.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.701
So the rumours are true?

44:10.880 --> 44:13.587
_ You and Francis
are gorng Into busmess together?

44:15.240 --> 44:17.424
I see you have your ear to the ground.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.981
Or should I say to the keyhole?

44:20.160 --> 44:24.938
(Chuckles) I'm surprised to hear
you're pinning your hopes on Wheal Grace.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.906
What do you hope to find there? Gold?

44:27.080 --> 44:28.661
No.

44:29.320 --> 44:32.221
Freedom to call our souls our own.

44:33.760 --> 44:37.059
I suppose you know where
Francis got the money he's investing?

44:37.240 --> 44:39.504
Yes and we're very much obliged to you,
George.

44:39.680 --> 44:44.140
Yes, we paid it him for services rendered.

44:45.080 --> 44:48.379
In exchange for the names of
the Carnmore Copper Company shareholders.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.141
600.

44:51.120 --> 44:54.578
Or should I say 30 pieces of silver?

45:02.120 --> 45:04.338
MAN: Hey! Hey, there!

45:04.520 --> 45:05.908
Stop it!

45:08.480 --> 45:09.947
(Grunting)

45:10.120 --> 45:11.621
- (Clattering)
- (Man cries out)

45:11.800 --> 45:13.427
Hey, there!

45:30.960 --> 45:32.541
Get out!

45:34.240 --> 45:35.946
Sir?

45:41.040 --> 45:42.701
(Door slams)

45:55.800 --> 45:56.983
Ross?

46:09.960 --> 46:11.825
(Grunts)

46:12.000 --> 46:13.979
(Panﬁng)

46:23.240 --> 46:25.026
DWIGHT: Could it be true?

46:25.880 --> 46:28.019
Francis certainly had
the money from George.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.383
And it's clear to me _
he had something on hIS conSCIence,

46:31.560 --> 46:34.859
but the thought that he would
deliberately sell my secrets to George...

46:35.040 --> 46:37.463
If it's true, how can I go into business with him?

46:38.320 --> 46:42.745
- But if you accuse him and you're wrong?
- He'll never forgive me.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.423
So, either way, the partnership is doomed.

46:47.440 --> 46:50.386
ANDREW: Captain Poldark?
- Captain Blamey!

46:51.640 --> 46:54.347
- You've been in the wars?
- My surgeon has patched me up.

46:54.520 --> 46:57.865
Dr Dwight Enys...Captain Andrew Blamey,
my cousin Verity's husband.

46:58.040 --> 46:59.780
- Your servant, sir.
- And yours, sir.

46:59.960 --> 47:03.623
If you're sure you'll survive,
I've other patients to attend to.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.426
Dwight!

47:08.560 --> 47:11.222
There is one further service
you can render me.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.865
I don't think you're at all like your father,
are you, my dear?

47:33.040 --> 47:35.258
No, ma'am. I favour my mother.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.146
She was very beautiful.

47:38.200 --> 47:39.781
More so than...

47:40.840 --> 47:44.947
After she died, people tried
to poison me against her, but I know better.

47:45.120 --> 47:48.066
- She was a saint.
- Of course.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.583
And I know I could never replace her.

47:51.720 --> 47:55.907
But I hope you'll come to look upon me
as a loving friend.

48:10.520 --> 48:14.627
- Is Verity well?
- Exceedingly. Well, that's not entirely true.

48:14.800 --> 48:19.225
She tries to conceal it,
but I know she grieves the loss of her family

48:19.400 --> 48:21.459
and I am the last person to intervene.

48:21.640 --> 48:24.586
- You are.
FRANCIS: Enys told me to come say hello.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.978
Apparently, you're barred from the Red Lion.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.501
- You...
- Walk with us, Francis.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.820
- You look as ifyou need the air.
- I will not trouble you in this company.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.824
Francis, this is the last moment
to wipe out the past.

49:06.160 --> 49:11.666
My erm...sister seems to find
her new life agreeable.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.383
And I will never give her cause
to think otherwise.

49:18.560 --> 49:22.587
- Not that she takes account of my approval.
- She would dearly love it.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.069
That's why I also desire it.

49:32.240 --> 49:36.665
Suppose you've heard of my cousin's
encounter with George Warleggan?

49:37.560 --> 49:40.859
Threw him across the Red Lion, broke his nose.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.388
- Not quite.
- I congratulate you.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.585
I've wished to do the same myself.

49:47.640 --> 49:53.101
Verity told me about a developing feud.
What was the cause ofthe quarrel today?

49:57.280 --> 49:59.259
I took a dislike to his neck-cloth.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.619
(Andrew laughs)

50:06.560 --> 50:08.027
Ow!

50:08.200 --> 50:09.861
(Groans)

50:11.520 --> 50:13.499
Time to go. Time to go home.

50:13.680 --> 50:15.659
(Groaning and panting)

50:21.680 --> 50:23.181
Ow!

50:23.360 --> 50:24.941
(Door opens)

50:25.120 --> 50:28.829
Oh, Andrew, I can't bear it. Esther despises me.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.140
When James comes, pray excuse me.
I cannot face both ofthem together.

50:32.320 --> 50:37.189
My dear...this is James...my son.

50:38.480 --> 50:41.620
Good day to you, ma'am.
I've heard a deal of good about you.

50:44.200 --> 50:48.341
You'll pardon the liberty, ma'am, but one
don't get a new mother every day ofthe week.

50:48.520 --> 50:49.862
Come down, Esther.

50:50.040 --> 50:54.545
I know you'll be sulking, but this is
our family now, so it's well to get used to it.

50:56.200 --> 50:59.067
Do you have any rum, ma'am?
I've a powerful thirst on me.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.707
Of course.

51:02.840 --> 51:06.025
You spoke to him? Civilly?

51:07.640 --> 51:09.619
And shook his hand.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.145
(Grunts)

51:18.520 --> 51:20.101
(Gasps)

51:20.280 --> 51:22.419
(Grunts and moans)

51:24.120 --> 51:32.425
Demelza?

51:37.080 --> 51:38.980
Garrick?

51:39.160 --> 51:42.459
- Where's Garrick?
- Sir, I tell'd mistress not to go, but...

51:42.640 --> 51:44.107
Prudie?

51:45.160 --> 51:47.378
- You let her go?
- 'Ee ever tried to stop 'er?

51:47.560 --> 51:49.300
(Mutters)

51:56.840 --> 51:58.546
(Demelza grunts)

52:03.080 --> 52:04.786
Give me the oars, Demelza.

52:04.960 --> 52:07.667
- I can manage. (Grunts)
- Give me the oars!

52:09.080 --> 52:12.026
- You are the most stubborn, pigheaded...
- (Groans)

52:12.200 --> 52:14.907
- Oh, I am?
- Where would you be if I hadn't come along?

52:15.080 --> 52:20.461
Where would you be if I hadn't come along?
Drinkin' an brawlin' an' dodgin' the noose.

52:20.640 --> 52:23.700
Let's examine my failings
at a more convenient time, shall we?

52:23.880 --> 52:26.019
- (Grunts)
- Come on.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.304
Ah, Judas!

52:29.320 --> 52:31.788
- (Grunts)
- Stop wriggling!

52:31.960 --> 52:34.667
- You're hateful! (Groans)
- You're infuriating!

52:35.560 --> 52:36.822
(Demelza screams)

52:37.000 --> 52:39.468
- I could crown you!
- By all means.

52:39.640 --> 52:41.619
Once you've delivered our child.

52:51.880 --> 52:53.461
(Footsteps)

52:59.240 --> 53:00.980
You have a son.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.139
(Baby cries)

54:05.240 --> 54:08.585
GEORGE: Miss Penvenen,
you're surely not returning to London?

54:08.760 --> 54:11.627
- Help me to change her mind, George.
- Don't trouble yourself.

54:11.800 --> 54:15.782
I must return to civilisation. _
One can only take so many barbarians.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.501
Dr Enys?

54:18.680 --> 54:20.898
I've ordered more oranges.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.347
Oranges?

54:24.560 --> 54:25.982
Goodbye, Dwight.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.707
Such a quaint name.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.739
I wonder ifwe'll ever meet again.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.948
Drive on!

54:55.720 --> 54:59.907
Wheal Grace.
I never thought I'd see the day.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.547
Nor I.

55:01.720 --> 55:03.426
Nor any of us.

55:06.160 --> 55:08.185
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.423
- To the Poldarks.
- And Wheal Grace.

55:12.600 --> 55:15.740
ALL: The Poldarks and Wheal Grace!

55:20.240 --> 55:23.585
ANDREW: Shall we go and have a look round?
ELIZABETH: Yes.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.544
My father named this mine after my mother.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.179
He did love 'er.

55:30.880 --> 55:32.222
He did.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.618
Yet folks said he was a wastrel.

55:34.800 --> 55:37.940
(Chuckles) While she lived, she kept him steady.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.464
- He set his course by her.
- Like the North Star.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.147
Like the North Star.

55:48.040 --> 55:50.019
But I have no such need.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.744
The North Star is not the brightest in the slq.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.341
Well, what is?

55:57.520 --> 55:59.181
The Dog Star.

56:00.760 --> 56:02.341
Which is fitting...

56:03.560 --> 56:05.744
..since I found my star in a dog fight.
