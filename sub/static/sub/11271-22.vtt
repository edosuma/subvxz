00:01.874 --> 00:04.874
I'LL BE SEEING YOU (PART 2)

00:05.075 --> 00:10.956
- That's it, folks. Let's lock it up.
- Hey, Carla. Can I give you a lift?

00:11.123 --> 00:16.293
- I doubt it.
- Let me give you a ride home.

00:16.460 --> 00:20.588
- A ride home? I know what that means.
- What?

00:20.755 --> 00:25.385
We'll get to my place and you'll say,
"I could do with a coffee. "

00:25.552 --> 00:29.847
Out of the goodness of my heart,
I'll invite you in.

00:30.013 --> 00:34.184
We'll talk for a while.
Then it'll get later, quieter.

00:34.351 --> 00:37.979
You'll ask me if my radio works.
I'll say, "Yeah. "

00:38.146 --> 00:43.734
You'll put on a soft music station,
we'll start dancing around the kitchen.

00:43.901 --> 00:49.281
As we dance, you'll take a chance.
You'll give me a kiss right here.

00:49.448 --> 00:53.618
- I'm not that kind of guy.
- Shut up and listen.

00:55.828 --> 00:58.831
You give me a kiss
and a nibble on the ear.

00:58.998 --> 01:01.167
- Which ear?
- Your choice.

01:01.333 --> 01:05.044
I respond reluctantly
which makes you crazy.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

02:09.517 --> 02:14.689
I'm Ernie Pantusso. I'll tell you
what happened last week on "Cheers".

02:14.856 --> 02:18.692
I'm good at explaining things.
I was a baseball coach.

02:18.859 --> 02:23.572
Let me illustrate. You may remember me
from my playing days.

02:23.739 --> 02:27.200
I hold the record
for the most times hit by a pitch.

02:27.367 --> 02:30.703
That's as good as a hit.
Anyway, where was I?

02:30.870 --> 02:36.041
Last week on "Cheers", this fellow
Semenko came into the bar.

02:36.208 --> 02:43.464
He's a very famous artist. While he was
here, he saw Diane and he got an idea.

02:43.631 --> 02:47.385
He decided to paint her.
He thought she was speciaI.

02:47.551 --> 02:52.055
Diane loved the idea. She'd heard
of him and thought he was good,

02:52.222 --> 02:54.849
and Diane's very smart.

02:55.016 --> 03:00.437
The trouble is, when Sam met
this artist Semenko, he hated him.

03:00.604 --> 03:05.109
He told him not to paint Diane's
picture and to get out.

03:05.275 --> 03:09.904
Semenko started to go. Sam left
the room. Diane pretended to go along,

03:10.071 --> 03:12.198
but went behind Sam's back.

03:12.365 --> 03:17.619
Wait. This is starting to look
like a diagram for our old double steaI.

03:17.786 --> 03:23.749
When the pitcher goes into his wind-up,
the runners break for second and third.

03:23.916 --> 03:27.044
If they are occupied,
second breaks for third.

03:27.211 --> 03:30.715
Third goes home.
The batter hits to the opposite field

03:30.881 --> 03:36.511
so the fielder's play is to home plate.
Sorry. This isn't the double steaI.

03:36.678 --> 03:39.888
These are directions
to my daughter's house.

03:40.055 --> 03:42.307
I'm wrong again. She moved.

03:42.474 --> 03:44.518
Or did she?

03:44.685 --> 03:48.062
Anyway,
Diane was going behind Sam's back.

03:48.229 --> 03:51.232
Wait. I really want you to paint me.

03:51.399 --> 03:54.819
What about that malignant growth
you call a boyfriend?

03:54.986 --> 03:59.906
Once he sees the finished work, he'll
forgive me. He'll forgive everything.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.618
He'll hate it.
And he'll hate you for doing it.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.953
So you won't do it?

04:06.120 --> 04:08.164
I'll do it for free.

04:08.330 --> 04:13.543
I'm worried. I can't remember
where my daughter lives.

04:13.710 --> 04:16.087
Oh, well, you're up-to-date.

04:16.254 --> 04:20.507
It's somewhere in New England.
Something Lane or Drive.

04:32.935 --> 04:34.979
Listen up, everybody, will you?

04:35.146 --> 04:37.189
The picnic is off.

04:38.356 --> 04:43.320
- Why is that, Coach?
- Lack of interest. I'm calling it quits.

04:43.487 --> 04:45.654
Sorry to spoiI your picnic.

04:45.821 --> 04:47.865
My picnic?

04:48.908 --> 04:51.535
You think I was doing this all for me?

04:51.702 --> 04:57.665
You think I like sitting out in the dirt
and fighting the ants for a chicken leg?

04:57.832 --> 04:59.876
I can do that at home.

05:00.043 --> 05:06.173
But listen. Forget everything. Forget the
picnic, forget my sweat and my work.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.508
Forget me.

05:09.885 --> 05:13.137
What the heck.
I'm going to Coach's picnic.

05:13.304 --> 05:16.474
Stick my name up there too,
will you, Taffy?

05:20.644 --> 05:24.773
Pathetic-old-man bit, Carla,
works like a charm.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.110
Afternoon, everybody.

05:32.112 --> 05:36.449
- What's up, Normie?
- The temperature under my collar.

05:36.616 --> 05:40.995
- What's the matter?
- The Hungry Heifer Restaurant again.

05:41.162 --> 05:44.998
- It's the pits.
- You went back? I thought you hated it.

05:45.165 --> 05:50.671
- I got lured back, Surf and Turf SpeciaI.
- What's that? Lobster and steak?

05:50.837 --> 05:54.298
Tuna fish sandwich with beef gravy.

05:57.969 --> 06:00.345
Diane is late again today.

06:00.512 --> 06:03.640
You know, she's been late
every day this week.

06:03.807 --> 06:06.935
Ever since Sammy threw Semenko out.

06:07.102 --> 06:10.688
I could have told Sammy
a lot about that guy.

06:10.854 --> 06:12.898
He's a reaI headcase.

06:13.065 --> 06:19.153
And like all artists worthy of the name,
the man is a homosexuaI.

06:20.238 --> 06:23.658
You think everyone a bit different is gay.

06:23.825 --> 06:29.329
- I've given you the benefit of the doubt.
- You think all artists are gay?

06:29.496 --> 06:34.959
Absolutely. If you don't believe me,
I'll bring down this book from home.

06:35.126 --> 06:39.839
"Nude Male Statuary". You tell me
after looking at those pictures

06:40.005 --> 06:45.135
that the guys who chiselled those lads
aren't light on the loafers.

07:03.317 --> 07:05.361
It's wonderfuI.

07:05.528 --> 07:07.821
Really. It is.

07:11.825 --> 07:15.494
Damn it! I've run out of talent.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.374
I'm worthless.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.585
I'm a dog.

07:22.751 --> 07:26.212
Stick a knife
between my shoulder blades.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.257
Please. You do this every day.

07:31.049 --> 07:36.305
- Today it's different. I've really lost it.
- Is there anything I can do?

07:36.472 --> 07:40.475
- Well, there is one thing.
- Anything. What?

07:40.641 --> 07:42.894
Let's go to bed.

07:43.978 --> 07:47.814
You want to... make love?

07:47.981 --> 07:52.694
No, I always take a nap
with a blonde in the afternoon.

07:52.861 --> 07:57.281
I don't know what to say.
We have a professionaI relationship.

07:57.448 --> 07:59.492
Afterwards, you can pay me.

08:02.161 --> 08:04.621
I make love to everything I paint.

08:04.787 --> 08:09.751
You're most famous painting
is of the Harvard-Yale football game.

08:09.918 --> 08:12.961
Yes, I spent three months in jaiI.

08:14.254 --> 08:17.382
College types don't understand me.

08:17.549 --> 08:21.177
I do, however,
still get a few Christmas cards.

08:26.390 --> 08:29.142
You're a very talented man.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.354
If we had met at a different time...

08:32.520 --> 08:36.775
Wait a minute.
The problem is not my talent, it's you.

08:36.942 --> 08:42.988
You've lost your agony. You've lost that
sense of anguish that drew me to you.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.407
I'm sorry.
What should I do to get unhappy?

08:46.574 --> 08:50.036
Why don't you go see
what Bullwinkle's doing?

08:51.663 --> 08:54.498
- Don't call him that.
- Who?

08:54.665 --> 08:57.417
I know to whom you are referring.

08:57.584 --> 09:00.879
You're always making remarks
about him.

09:01.046 --> 09:08.010
- I don't like that. You don't know him.
- I know him better than you do.

09:08.177 --> 09:10.221
What a prize!

09:11.346 --> 09:13.473
Stop.

09:14.182 --> 09:17.602
I admit,
Sam and I are very different people.

09:19.228 --> 09:24.274
Sometimes that's good.
Sometimes it's not so good.

09:26.193 --> 09:28.444
Sometimes he makes me cry.

09:31.948 --> 09:35.118
Sometimes he hurts me
and seems to like it.

09:38.203 --> 09:43.624
That's it. It's back. The torment is back.

09:43.791 --> 09:47.086
And with it, my brilliance!

09:48.796 --> 09:53.591
- I'll put some coffee on.
- Never mind. I'm done.

09:55.343 --> 09:57.387
What?

10:07.646 --> 10:09.689
I love it.

10:10.648 --> 10:12.692
So will Sam. He will.

10:16.028 --> 10:18.488
I got it. My problems are solved.

10:18.655 --> 10:21.533
An exploding pizza for Diane?

10:23.160 --> 10:25.494
No. That's good, but no.

10:25.661 --> 10:29.874
Remember how she was disappointed
that I wouldn't let Smirnoff paint her?

10:30.040 --> 10:34.127
- Insists he's a great artist.
- We know what that means.

10:34.294 --> 10:36.963
I've got something to cheer her up.

10:37.130 --> 10:42.926
Someone did a painting from photos that
weren't good enough for Laughing Boy.

10:43.093 --> 10:47.222
- Where did you get it?
- Saw it in an ad in the TV guide.

10:47.389 --> 10:51.934
The one with the cover story
about the ten cutest sitcom kids.

10:52.101 --> 10:53.895
Interesting reading.

10:54.061 --> 11:00.484
This guy takes an ordinary photograph
and he turns it into a work of art.

11:00.650 --> 11:02.944
You ready for this?

11:13.162 --> 11:15.205
Good one, Sammy!

11:17.707 --> 11:20.877
Even I think that's tacky.

11:21.836 --> 11:23.879
ReaI jerky.

11:24.046 --> 11:26.089
I knew that.

11:26.256 --> 11:29.134
Don't you worry about me. I knew that.

11:29.843 --> 11:33.971
- A reaI work of art there.
- This is great, actually.

11:34.138 --> 11:36.974
I was afraid she might think
I was serious,

11:37.141 --> 11:41.937
but I see now that the humour of this
isn't wasted on anybody.

11:45.523 --> 11:49.985
It's the most powerfuI statements
of melancholy I've seen

11:50.152 --> 11:55.990
and Sam will appreciate that it's
atrabilious yet not a bit lugubrious.

11:56.157 --> 12:00.119
If you think
Sam's gonna love this painting,

12:00.286 --> 12:03.748
you're crazier than I'm accused of being.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.627
Go ahead and show it to him.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.005
Goodbye.

12:12.172 --> 12:15.383
You're not coming to the bar to show it?

12:15.549 --> 12:19.178
No. But say hi to all the gang for me.

12:20.513 --> 12:25.225
Besides, I think you should be alone
with Mortimer tomorrow.

12:25.392 --> 12:29.603
Don't call him that,
and why should I be alone with him?

12:29.770 --> 12:33.774
Because it's the last time
you'll ever see him.

12:48.161 --> 12:50.205
Hi, Carla. Sorry I'm late.

12:53.375 --> 12:57.753
- What's that?
- The large package is a portrait of me.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.840
It's that weirdo artist Sam threw out.

13:01.007 --> 13:04.509
- I know what you been doing.
- You figured it out.

13:04.676 --> 13:07.095
Of course. It's all so obvious.

13:08.555 --> 13:14.351
I've been late a lot this week. You've
had to do a lot of extra work. Here.

13:14.518 --> 13:17.312
- What is it?
- It's a gift.

13:18.397 --> 13:23.109
My way of saying you did something
nice for me. And I thank you.

13:32.033 --> 13:34.077
Hey, that's beautifuI.

13:34.244 --> 13:38.873
- You can wear it with your purple outfit.
- I probably can!

13:41.292 --> 13:45.962
It's polite to express gratitude
when one is given a gift.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.173
Yeah, right.

14:04.729 --> 14:07.356
Damn, I love that thing too.

14:07.523 --> 14:10.400
- Carla, keep it.
- Good.

14:13.028 --> 14:15.238
- Where's Sam?
- In the back.

14:15.405 --> 14:19.033
Why don't you take the day off?
I'll cover.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.494
I owe it to you. Join the picnic.

14:22.703 --> 14:26.915
OK. I know what you're doing.
I see what you're up to.

14:27.081 --> 14:33.337
You're doing all this just to get me to say
that thing that people say

14:33.504 --> 14:36.298
when other people do them favours.

14:36.465 --> 14:40.719
- You don't have to say it. Go.
- I don't? Thank you.

14:43.095 --> 14:46.057
I have to punish my tongue.

14:55.106 --> 14:58.567
- Hey, babe. What's up?
- This.

14:58.734 --> 15:02.905
- What's that?
- It's a painting of me.

15:04.990 --> 15:08.701
It was that Semenko guy.
You went behind my back.

15:08.868 --> 15:13.915
I told you I didn't want you to do this.
You knew how I felt and did it.

15:14.082 --> 15:17.626
Let's not talk untiI after you look.

15:17.793 --> 15:20.796
I don't want to look.
I want an explanation.

15:20.963 --> 15:26.801
- This is my explanation.
- Fine. I'II look at the damn thing.

15:26.968 --> 15:30.429
- Don't look in that frame of mind.
- Tough.

15:30.596 --> 15:36.268
You're upset. I don't want you to look
untiI your mind is open.

15:36.434 --> 15:39.812
It's filled with animosity
to Phillip and me.

15:39.979 --> 15:43.232
It is not. My mind is completely empty.

15:43.399 --> 15:47.194
I'm not going to have you look
untiI you calm down.

15:47.361 --> 15:53.032
You're crazy. First you tell me you want
me to look at it, now you won't let me.

15:53.199 --> 15:58.120
You can look. I just have to see
some evidence of calmness.

15:58.286 --> 16:00.330
I'm calm, Diane.

16:00.497 --> 16:03.083
- No, you're not.
- I am calm.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.419
No, you're not.

16:06.585 --> 16:10.506
I'm calm. If I were any more calm,
I would be dead.

16:12.341 --> 16:15.260
Your jaw muscles are quivering.

16:15.427 --> 16:19.639
I get that way when I'm about
to look at art. Now, come on.

16:22.933 --> 16:25.978
- We'll do this later.
- Fine.

16:28.856 --> 16:32.692
I don't want anything to distract you
from this painting.

16:32.859 --> 16:36.904
When you see it,
you'll understand and forgive.

16:37.988 --> 16:42.909
- What happens if I hate it?
- You know you're going to love it.

16:43.076 --> 16:47.997
Because in the last six months,
you've made so much progress.

16:48.164 --> 16:51.417
You sound like
you're talking about a chimp.

16:51.584 --> 16:54.711
I push the buttons
and out pops a banana?

16:54.878 --> 16:57.672
That's a ludicrous comparison.

16:57.839 --> 17:02.384
There isn't a chimp alive
who could keep up with you.

17:02.551 --> 17:07.347
I hate when you do this.
You tell poor Sam what he should like.

17:07.513 --> 17:13.810
What he shouldn't like. How he should
walk. What fork to use with soup.

17:13.978 --> 17:19.148
I know. You don't use a fork with soup.
It was a mistake.

17:19.316 --> 17:23.444
Do not say,
"You don't use a fork with soup. "

17:23.612 --> 17:26.615
Do not say,
"You don't use a fork with soup. "

17:27.990 --> 17:34.622
- My God. I've made you a babbling idiot.
- Who are you calling a babbling idiot?

17:34.788 --> 17:37.999
Don't get upset. I'm criticising myself.

17:38.166 --> 17:42.962
You call me a babbling idiot
and you're criticising yourself?

17:43.129 --> 17:47.382
Let me criticise me for a while.
You're sickening.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.679
I should have known.

17:53.846 --> 17:59.101
I tried to convince myself that you...
That I'm... That we're...

18:03.897 --> 18:09.276
This relationship has always been
a contest of wills. I give up.

18:09.443 --> 18:13.906
All my rage has gone.
Maybe everything has gone.

18:15.866 --> 18:20.578
I see what you're doing. You don't
wanna fight because I'm winning.

18:20.745 --> 18:26.583
I hammered you good. I've won a lot.
I just never mentioned it before.

18:26.750 --> 18:32.256
- Yeah, come on.
- I'm leaving. I find this very tiresome.

18:32.422 --> 18:36.676
You're not leaving yet.
Not till we've had a brouhaha.

18:36.842 --> 18:39.303
Brew on your own haha.

18:41.055 --> 18:43.598
I tell you, I'm through. I'm empty.

18:43.765 --> 18:47.769
The only thing
empty about you is your head.

18:49.187 --> 18:53.440
You leave and I'll be
crawling with chicks by sundown.

18:53.607 --> 18:55.651
Wait. I'm not through yet.

18:55.818 --> 19:00.071
You want that?
Watch this. I'm gonna do it too.

19:00.238 --> 19:02.282
I'm gonna do this.

19:04.450 --> 19:07.869
All right. Wait!
I'm saving my best for last!

19:08.036 --> 19:11.081
Ready for my best?
This is my best shot.

19:17.294 --> 19:19.338
My God.

19:19.505 --> 19:21.549
Childish.

19:22.883 --> 19:28.471
It's degrading to me, to you.
To the human race.

19:31.557 --> 19:33.851
This doesn't bother me at all.

19:34.018 --> 19:35.936
Stop it!

19:37.312 --> 19:41.983
- Gotcha. I win again.
- I want you to know something.

19:42.150 --> 19:48.238
Since knowing you, I've said to myself,
"One day, we'll get down to the reaI you. "

19:48.405 --> 19:50.449
Well, we did it.

19:51.616 --> 19:57.246
Do you know what the difference is
between you and a fat, braying ass?

19:57.413 --> 20:00.332
The fat, braying ass would.

20:03.502 --> 20:08.715
Speaking of fat, braying asses,
you're about to get dumped on yours.

20:08.882 --> 20:11.968
How dare you slap me?

20:15.345 --> 20:18.557
- Don't you ever hit me again.
- Like hell.

20:23.895 --> 20:29.274
You always think you've gotta get
the last one in. All right. Come on.

20:31.735 --> 20:34.196
- Please, let go.
- You first.

20:34.362 --> 20:37.907
All right. On the count of three.

20:39.074 --> 20:43.245
One, two, three. Now.

20:46.581 --> 20:49.876
- You're not letting go.
- You're squeezing harder.

20:50.043 --> 20:52.295
Because you're not letting go.

20:52.462 --> 20:57.591
I'm not letting go
cos you're squeezing harder. Come on.

20:57.758 --> 21:05.014
This is it. We have sunk as low
as human beings can sink.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.602
There's no degradation left.

21:16.316 --> 21:20.069
- Are you OK?
- Do I look OK?

21:21.570 --> 21:24.823
Actually, you look a little like Rudolph.

21:26.784 --> 21:32.664
Come to me, my sweet little reindeer.
Your big old stag's in town.

21:32.830 --> 21:35.083
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.876
- You hit me!
- Well, not hard.

21:38.961 --> 21:41.004
What does that mean, not hard?

21:41.171 --> 21:44.340
It means not as hard as I wanted to.

21:44.507 --> 21:47.927
- I'm leaving.
- Wait. You're not leaving yet.

21:48.094 --> 21:51.222
- Not untiI I say one more thing.
- What?

21:51.389 --> 21:53.974
Get the hell outta here.

22:02.064 --> 22:05.025
You are about to cross a dangerous line.

22:05.192 --> 22:07.528
You heard me. I want you out.

22:07.695 --> 22:12.657
If this is coming out of the heat
of the moment, it is a bad mistake.

22:12.824 --> 22:17.244
- One you will never be able to correct.
- Out.

22:17.411 --> 22:21.832
Because if I go,
I am never, ever coming back.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.085
Can I get that in writing?

22:25.251 --> 22:28.587
Damn, I only got pencils.
I'd like this in ink.

22:28.754 --> 22:32.300
Don't joke, Sam. I mean it.

22:32.466 --> 22:37.429
And I want you to understand.
If you don't stop me now,

22:37.595 --> 22:41.016
this is the last time you'll ever see me.

22:57.613 --> 22:59.656
Fine.

23:02.034 --> 23:04.327
Hey, Diane.

23:08.456 --> 23:10.499
This is it.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.841
This is it.

23:22.218 --> 23:24.011
Goodbye.

23:24.178 --> 23:26.221
Goodbye.

25:01.097 --> 25:02.098
