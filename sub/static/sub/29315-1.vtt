Bruce Springsteen was,

1:40:51.125 --> 1:40:53.750
to quote the album he is most famous for,

1:40:53.833 --> 1:40:55.416
born in the USA,

1:40:56.208 --> 1:40:59.708
but he has fans around the world,
including me.

1:41:00.833 --> 1:41:02.958
I was not born in the USA,

1:41:03.166 --> 1:41:05.916
and I grew up not
in Asbury Park, New Jersey,

1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:07.958
but Bury Park, Luton.

1:41:08.291 --> 1:41:10.125
But the reason
I connected with Springsteen

1:41:10.208 --> 1:41:13.041
is because what
he sings about and champions

1:41:13.125 --> 1:41:14.791
are not only American values

1:41:15.083 --> 1:41:16.875
but are the best of human values.

and holding on to your dreams

1:41:20.625 --> 1:41:22.416
and not letting the hardness of the world

1:41:22.500 --> 1:41:25.291
stop you from letting
the best of you slip away.

1:41:26.708 --> 1:41:28.041
In these words,

1:41:28.125 --> 1:41:32.125
I see a bridge between Springsteen
and my own Asian upbringing.

1:41:33.125 --> 1:41:35.083
[woman whispers] Just this way.

1:41:43.500 --> 1:41:48.000
And that is why the music and values
of Springsteen's American dream

1:41:48.083 --> 1:41:50.458
can reach and touch a boy from...

1:41:56.916 --> 1:41:59.000
I'm sorry.
I don't know if I can read this.

1:42:00.125 --> 1:42:01.916
You can. Go on.

1:42:08.958 --> 1:42:12.000
When I wrote it,
I really believed every word, but now...

1:42:16.500 --> 1:42:18.750
A lot has happened
since I wrote those words.

1:42:20.208 --> 1:42:23.291
Then, I thought Bruce Springsteen
was the answer

1:42:23.708 --> 1:42:25.875
and all I had to do was live by his words.

1:42:28.833 --> 1:42:30.208
I don't think that's true anymore.

1:42:33.791 --> 1:42:37.375
Bruce Springsteen got out of New Jersey
by following his dream.

1:42:38.375 --> 1:42:39.333
Bruce sings,

1:42:39.958 --> 1:42:43.416
"If dreams came true, well,
wouldn't that be nice?

1:42:43.666 --> 1:42:46.125
But this ain't no dream
we're living through tonight.

1:42:46.208 --> 1:42:49.125
If you want it,
you take it, and you pay the price."

1:42:51.625 --> 1:42:54.833
So the question I'm asking is:
Can I pay that price?

1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:59.875
I know having dreams
doesn't make me a bad son.

1:43:01.791 --> 1:43:03.625
I also know that everything I am

1:43:03.708 --> 1:43:06.250
is because of the sacrifices
my mum and dad made.

1:43:14.458 --> 1:43:16.291
My dad's not a typical dad.

1:43:19.666 --> 1:43:22.833
[sniffling] We don't have jokey chats.

1:43:22.916 --> 1:43:24.291
He's not like the dad you see on telly.

1:43:26.750 --> 1:43:29.500
A lot of the time, he seems
pretty angry at the world.

1:43:32.166 --> 1:43:35.791
I think Bruce Springsteen
would understand my dad,

1:43:36.958 --> 1:43:39.791
cause like his father, they both
came from poor backgrounds,

1:43:40.666 --> 1:43:42.333
both worked hard in factories,

1:43:42.833 --> 1:43:46.375
both had dreams that never came true,
which left them angry.

1:43:49.333 --> 1:43:52.166
And they both had sons who wanted
the chance to make them proud.

1:44:02.583 --> 1:44:06.833
Bruce has a song called
"Blinded by the Light."

1:44:08.750 --> 1:44:12.625
And when I first heard it, I thought...
I thought it was about love

1:44:14.041 --> 1:44:19.166
and being blinded by the love
we might have for a girl or money.

1:44:22.041 --> 1:44:23.916
But last night, I listened to it again.

1:44:26.125 --> 1:44:28.458
And Bruce is saying so much more.

1:44:29.958 --> 1:44:32.500
I was blinded by the light
when I first heard Springsteen

1:44:32.583 --> 1:44:34.833
because I was only thinking,
in that moment,

1:44:35.916 --> 1:44:37.791
about Springsteen and me.

1:44:40.916 --> 1:44:44.333
But we're not all just individuals.

1:44:45.166 --> 1:44:46.375
We have friends...

1:44:48.583 --> 1:44:49.541
and family...

1:44:51.125 --> 1:44:53.333
and what they think does matter.

1:44:54.708 --> 1:44:57.791
Success without them isn't really success.

1:44:59.791 --> 1:45:01.375
Being blinded meant I couldn't see

1:45:01.458 --> 1:45:04.791
how much I am like my dad
and my dad is like me.

1:45:06.583 --> 1:45:08.458
And as much as I wanted to leave Luton,

1:45:09.708 --> 1:45:12.250
I understand that it will never leave me.

1:45:14.541 --> 1:45:18.791
Bruce says no one wins
unless everybody wins.

1:45:20.875 --> 1:45:25.708
My hope is to build a bridge
to my ambitions

1:45:26.250 --> 1:45:28.291
but not a wall between my family and me.

1:45:30.541 --> 1:45:31.666
That's my dream.

1:45:32.958 --> 1:45:34.375
My American dream.

1:45:36.958 --> 1:45:37.916
In Luton.

1:45:41.500 --> 1:45:43.916
[soft piano music]

1:46:11.458 --> 1:46:12.666

1:46:14.250 --> 1:46:15.875
I've missed you like mad.

1:46:18.291 --> 1:46:20.833
Like a river that don't know
where it's flowing,

1:46:21.708 --> 1:46:24.416
you took a wrong turn
and you just kept going.

1:46:27.250 --> 1:46:29.083
But everybody's got a hungry heart.

1:46:30.208 --> 1:46:31.958
Everybody's got a hungry heart.

1:46:37.541 --> 1:46:38.625

1:46:39.458 --> 1:46:41.083

Thank you.

1:46:44.583 --> 1:46:46.125

are you sure he's American?

1:47:28.500 --> 1:47:30.958
Yes. And not Jewish.

1:47:31.041 --> 1:47:32.041
I read his songs.

1:47:32.125 --> 1:47:35.708
He said work hard,
don't give up, respect your parents.

1:47:35.791 --> 1:47:37.291
This man must be Pakistani. [laughter]

-Yeah.

-I've made some food for you.
-Mum...

1:48:09.708 --> 1:48:11.208
I meant to give you this.

1:48:11.458 --> 1:48:14.041
It's amazing what a good price
I got for my Bruce collection.

1:48:14.916 --> 1:48:15.916
I can easily replace that.
