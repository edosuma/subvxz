<i>The war criminals will proceed
in orderly fashion...</i>

03:14.278 --> 03:18.531
<i>to the main waiting room
and await instructions.</i>

03:18.616 --> 03:22.827
<i>No talking. Obey the guards.</i>

03:24.288 --> 03:28.625
<i>War criminals must proceed
to the main waiting room.</i>

03:30.711 --> 03:35.173
<i>Those caught talking
will be severely punished.</i>

04:22.304 --> 04:24.305
The emperor.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.892
Your Majesty.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.936
What do they think they are doing?

04:30.020 --> 04:32.021
Get up. It is dangerous.

04:32.106 --> 04:36.109
Go back. Go back. Go!

04:36.193 --> 04:38.778
Are you mad?
They could kill us all.

04:38.863 --> 04:40.029
Go. Go.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.232
Open the door!

06:39.316 --> 06:41.443
Open the door!

06:42.528 --> 06:44.529
Open the door!

06:45.781 --> 06:48.032
Open the door!

07:17.354 --> 07:18.855
Mama.

07:43.088 --> 07:46.799
By the command of Her Imperial Majesty...

07:46.884 --> 07:50.470
also called the Compassionate and the Blessed...

07:50.554 --> 07:53.973
the Respectful and the Long-living...

07:54.058 --> 07:56.809
the Empress Dowager commands...

07:56.894 --> 07:58.853
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...

07:58.937 --> 08:01.147
son of Prince Chun...

08:01.231 --> 08:05.026
shall be transferred immediately...

08:05.110 --> 08:07.028
to the Forbidden City...

08:07.112 --> 08:09.447
and will remain in the Great Within...

08:09.531 --> 08:12.325
awaiting Her Majesty's decision.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.410
Respect this!

08:51.281 --> 08:54.283
Ar Mo, I am giving you my son.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.954
- My son is your son.
- Quick! Quick!

09:21.019 --> 09:23.020
I want to go home.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.482
No. Look at the Forbidden City.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.413
Give him to me.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.125
Ar Mo!

10:54.655 --> 10:58.199
Pu Yi, come here.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.842
How small you are.

11:15.926 --> 11:19.053
Are you afraid of me?

11:19.137 --> 11:21.347
Everyone is.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.894
I am the Grand Empress Dowager.

11:27.896 --> 11:33.067
And I have lived here
for a long, long time.

11:44.329 --> 11:49.041
And they call me the old Buddha.

11:54.923 --> 11:58.384
This is Peony.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.220
Do you like her?

12:01.305 --> 12:03.514
Men, you know...

12:03.599 --> 12:07.935
are not allowed in the Forbidden City
after dark.

12:09.646 --> 12:13.399
Even little men like you.

12:13.483 --> 12:17.111
The only man who can live here...

12:17.195 --> 12:19.697
is the emperor.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.869
But the emperor is on high...

12:24.953 --> 12:28.706
riding the dragon now.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.377
He died today.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.147
Longevity.

12:57.069 --> 13:02.782
These other men...
They are not real men.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.743
They are all eunuchs.

13:12.167 --> 13:18.089
And now they are all
waiting for me to die.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.132
That is why...

13:20.217 --> 13:24.929
they are putting my bed
in the middle of the room...

13:25.013 --> 13:28.057
under the black pearl.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.521
Little Pu Yi...

13:36.733 --> 13:39.402
I have decided...

13:39.486 --> 13:44.824
that you will be the new Lord
of 10,000 Years.

13:46.076 --> 13:51.872
You will be the Son of Heaven.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.344
Are we going home, Papa?

15:56.498 --> 15:58.332
Shh! Shh!

16:02.712 --> 16:04.547
Shh. It will soon be over.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.843
Look!

16:19.729 --> 16:21.730
Look.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.826
Cricket!

18:09.297 --> 18:11.382
Cricket! Cricket!
Where's the cricket?

18:11.466 --> 18:14.760
Ah, he is my friend, Your Majesty.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.596
Safe and warm under my arm.

18:18.682 --> 18:21.725
Kept me company
on the long journey here.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.603
Ah. See?

18:25.855 --> 18:29.525
He is kowtowing to Your Majesty.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.945
Now he can be the emperor's cricket.

18:43.373 --> 18:46.709
Your Majesty, this is the Forbidden City.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.338
Look.

18:51.423 --> 18:54.133
This little one
is Your Majesty's bedroom.

18:54.217 --> 18:57.094
- This is where we are.
- Am I going home today?

18:57.178 --> 18:59.555
Not today.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.557
Not yet.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.686
And here. Look.
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony...

19:05.770 --> 19:07.771
where Your Majesty was crowned.

19:16.072 --> 19:20.617
I give Your Majesty
the Gate of Marshovala.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.537
I give you the Marshio Gate.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.999
- The gate.
- Yes. Yes.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.585
And the Palace of the Cloudless Heaven.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.339
And... Yes.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.633
Your Majesty,
your imperial bath is ready.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.636
I don't like baths!

19:39.721 --> 19:43.098
I don't like baths.
I don't like baths.

19:48.703 --> 19:50.271
No bean curd today...

19:50.356 --> 19:51.440
and no meat!

20:07.874 --> 20:11.377
Is it true I can do anything I want?

20:11.461 --> 20:13.504
Of course, Your Majesty.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.506
Anything you want.

20:15.590 --> 20:18.008
You are the Lord of 10,000 Years.

20:18.093 --> 20:21.970
Oh! Oh, no!
Not in my face.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.391
I'm the Son of Heaven!
I'm the Son of Heaven!

20:25.475 --> 20:28.102
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

20:28.186 --> 20:30.938
I am the Son of Heaven!

20:31.022 --> 20:33.107
I am the Son of Heaven!

20:34.651 --> 20:37.444
Ar Mo. I want to go home.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.947
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

20:40.031 --> 20:44.535
I want to go home, Ar Mo.
I want to go home.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.348
Once upon a time...

21:06.433 --> 21:09.476
there was a great tree...

21:09.561 --> 21:13.105
and a great wind.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.357
And when the tree fell...

21:15.442 --> 21:17.526
the monkeys were scattered.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.720
His soup is getting cold.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.724
- Where am I?
- In the People's Republic of China.

21:55.732 --> 21:59.067
- Why did you stop me?
- You are a criminal. You must be judged.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.324
I repeat!

22:47.408 --> 22:51.078
Prisoners going to their cells
will walk with their heads bowed.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.080
Keep your eyes on the ground.

22:53.164 --> 22:55.199
No looking forward or to the side.

22:56.084 --> 22:59.127
The guards will give you directions
and tell you when to turn.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.354
Pu Chieh.

23:38.793 --> 23:43.005
Your guest is waiting to meet you,
Your Majesty.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.553
Also, your mother has arrived.

23:50.638 --> 23:54.725
You have not seen your mother
for many years, Your Majesty.

24:06.237 --> 24:09.948
- He is so small.
- He is young, Your Majesty.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.409
Go.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.453
Go.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.085
The emperor's brother,
His Excellency Pu Chieh.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.147
Ar Mo.

24:55.370 --> 24:58.330
How is the health
of His Majesty's mother?

24:58.414 --> 25:01.083
It is better. Thank you.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.752
How much His Majesty has grown.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.634
My mother has not seen me
for seven years.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.057
Do you remember my face?

25:17.141 --> 25:18.392
No.

25:20.561 --> 25:24.147
The night they came with the horses,
I knew it would be like this.

25:24.232 --> 25:28.068
- My brother sees you every day.
- Pu Chieh is very excited to meet you.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.153
He often talks about you.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.989
We are all very proud of you.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.200
The kite.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.160
He chose this for you.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.968
Papa!

26:33.176 --> 26:35.093
They're turning away.

26:35.178 --> 26:38.764
Of course. Ordinary people
are not allowed to look at the emperor.

26:38.848 --> 26:43.518
- I'm too important.
- Is it true that you can do whatever you want?

26:43.603 --> 26:47.731
Of course I can. If I am naughty,
someone else is punished.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.733
One of them.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.947
Stop!

26:56.032 --> 26:58.033
The emperor will walk.

27:06.667 --> 27:10.128
I have never met other children.

27:10.213 --> 27:13.799
- Are they all like you?
- I've got three sisters and two friends.

27:13.883 --> 27:16.301
If you come to our house,
you can play with us.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.553
The emperor never leaves the palace.

27:19.931 --> 27:21.932
We play games together!

27:22.016 --> 27:23.934
I know a game too.

27:24.018 --> 27:26.019
Run!

28:20.074 --> 28:22.826
The ones on the boat
are the high consorts.

28:22.910 --> 28:26.913
- High consorts?
- The wives of the emperor before me.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.958
They say they're my mother,
but they're not. They're not!

30:32.415 --> 30:35.750
Why are you wearing that?
You are not allowed to wear yellow.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.504
But this is ordinary yellow.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.256
It is imperial yellow.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.008
No, it is not.

30:43.092 --> 30:46.678
We say it is.
Only the emperor can wear that yellow.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.680
- Take it off.
- No!

30:48.764 --> 30:52.058
- Take it off!
- No! And you're not the emperor anymore.

30:52.143 --> 30:54.019
There is a new emperor now.

30:54.103 --> 30:58.273
He has cut off his queue.
And instead of a camel, he has got a car.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.234
What did you say?

31:01.318 --> 31:03.319
You're not the emperor.

31:07.408 --> 31:10.035
Liar!

31:10.119 --> 31:13.329
- You're not the emperor anymore!
- Liar!

31:13.414 --> 31:15.707
- Liar!
- You're not the--

31:18.793 --> 31:19.794
Liar!

31:20.379 --> 31:22.181
You're not the emperor.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.966
- Liar!
- You're not the emperor!

31:25.051 --> 31:27.052
How dare you!

31:30.222 --> 31:32.348
You're not the emperor!

31:32.433 --> 31:34.851
Please. No!

31:34.935 --> 31:38.605
Your Majesty. Calm yourself.

31:38.689 --> 31:41.816
- You're not the emperor!
- How dare you!

31:41.901 --> 31:45.528
Oh, Your Majesty.
Calm yourself.

31:46.614 --> 31:49.074
Am I the emperor or not?

31:49.158 --> 31:52.619
Your Majesty will always be the emperor.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.662
- You see?
- Prove it.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.167
Big Foot.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.672
Drink it.

32:04.757 --> 32:07.509
Go on. Drink the green ink.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.154
I will show you!

32:59.145 --> 33:03.523
See? That is a car.
He's the president of the Republic.

34:03.334 --> 34:05.585
Why is this wall here,
Lord Chamberlain?

34:06.754 --> 34:11.257
It is just a wall, Your Majesty.
Nothing has changed.

34:11.342 --> 34:13.342
You are lying.

34:27.983 --> 34:31.694
High Tutor, am I still the emperor?

34:31.779 --> 34:36.241
You will always be the emperor
inside the Forbidden City...

34:36.324 --> 34:38.909
but not outside.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.995
I do not understand.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.165
Outside China is now a republic...

34:44.250 --> 34:46.251
with a president.

34:47.378 --> 34:49.587
Where is Ar Mo?

34:51.172 --> 34:53.174
Ar Mo.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.073
You are all liars!

35:23.706 --> 35:26.624
- Let me say good-bye!
- Hurry. Hurry.

35:31.547 --> 35:33.631
He's my child!

35:51.734 --> 35:53.693
Ar Mo?

35:53.777 --> 35:55.778
Ar Mo?

36:06.040 --> 36:08.708
I do not understand.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.918
I do not understand.

36:11.003 --> 36:15.715
Your Majesty is a big boy now.
He cannot have a wet nurse anymore.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.800
It is much better like this.

36:17.885 --> 36:20.011
Much healthier.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.722
But she is not my wet nurse.

36:23.766 --> 36:26.392
She is my butterfly.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.698
Ar Mo!

36:42.451 --> 36:44.452
Ar Mo!

36:50.459 --> 36:52.460
Ar Mo!

36:54.129 --> 36:56.130
Ar Mo!

36:56.215 --> 36:58.257
Ar Mo!

36:58.342 --> 37:00.343
Ar Mo!

37:03.555 --> 37:05.556
Ar Mo!

37:10.145 --> 37:12.814
Ar Mo!

37:58.026 --> 38:01.154
This is the detention center...

38:01.238 --> 38:04.866
of the Fushun Bureau
of Public Security.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.618
And I am the governor.

38:07.703 --> 38:11.539
During the war,
this was a Japanese prison.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.833
Many of you may remember it...

38:13.917 --> 38:16.961
because you worked with the Japanese.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.464
You were responsible for building it...

38:19.548 --> 38:22.300
and you filled it with innocent people.

38:22.384 --> 38:24.177
How could this happen?

38:24.261 --> 38:26.554
Why did you betray your country?

38:26.638 --> 38:29.182
What turned you into war criminals?

38:29.266 --> 38:33.144
We believe that men are born good.

38:33.228 --> 38:39.066
We believe that the only way to change
is to discover the truth and look at it in the face.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.945
That is why you are here.

38:43.030 --> 38:46.782
You will begin by writing
the story of your lives...

38:46.867 --> 38:49.160
and by confessing your crimes.

38:49.244 --> 38:55.166
Your salvation will lie entirely
in the attitude you take.

38:55.250 --> 38:59.670
I advise you to be frank and sincere.

38:59.755 --> 39:04.717
Otherwise, things can still go
very badly for you.

39:30.744 --> 39:32.703
<i>After a few years...</i>

39:32.788 --> 39:36.249
<i>the Chinese Republic had become
as corrupt as the old empire.</i>

39:36.333 --> 39:42.296
<i>It fell quickly into the hands
of ambitious generals and corrupt bureaucrats.</i>

39:42.381 --> 39:45.675
<i>The era of the warlords had begun.</i>

39:45.759 --> 39:50.721
<i>By May 1919, when I received my appointment,
China was in turmoil.</i>

41:57.140 --> 41:59.767
May the new tutor present himself.

42:15.242 --> 42:18.202
Your Imperial Highness, the new tutor.

42:20.539 --> 42:23.374
Mr. Reginald Fleming Johnston.

42:24.543 --> 42:26.794
How do you do, Mr. Johnston?

42:26.878 --> 42:30.506
How do you do, Your Majesty?

42:41.101 --> 42:43.310
Now we will go to school.

42:44.771 --> 42:47.898
Your Majesty, in my country,
it would be usual to begin...

42:47.983 --> 42:50.359
with some kind of an examination.

42:51.570 --> 42:53.863
The emperor cannot be examined.

42:53.947 --> 42:56.073
Well, that may have to change.

42:56.158 --> 43:00.494
But first Your Majesty might like
to ask me some questions.

43:04.166 --> 43:06.083
Where are your ancestors buried?

43:06.168 --> 43:08.169
In Scotland, Your Majesty.

43:10.797 --> 43:13.299
But then, where's your skirt?

43:13.383 --> 43:16.302
In your country, men wear short skirts,
do they not?

43:16.386 --> 43:21.557
No, Your Majesty. Scotsmen do not wear skirts.
They wear kilts.

43:21.641 --> 43:24.351
- Kilts?
- Kilts.

43:24.436 --> 43:28.314
A matter of words, perhaps,
but words are important.

43:28.398 --> 43:30.566
Why are words important?

43:30.650 --> 43:35.738
If you cannot say what you mean, Your Majesty,
you will never mean what you say...

43:35.822 --> 43:39.825
and a gentleman should always mean
what he says.

43:39.910 --> 43:43.621
Ah, yes. A gentleman.

43:43.705 --> 43:45.706
Are you a gentleman?

43:46.792 --> 43:50.419
I would like to be a gentleman,
Your Majesty.

43:50.504 --> 43:53.798
- I try to be.
- I am not a gentleman.

43:53.882 --> 43:56.008
I'm not allowed to say what I mean.

43:56.092 --> 43:58.552
They are always telling me
what to say.

44:00.305 --> 44:03.224
Your Majesty is still very young.

44:05.894 --> 44:10.397
I thought he might like to see
some English and American magazines.

44:10.482 --> 44:14.068
I have just received them.

44:19.282 --> 44:21.909
I know that you know that I know...

44:21.993 --> 44:24.662
that you know that
that is a dialogue...

44:24.746 --> 44:27.331
between Confucius and Chuang-Tsu.

44:28.333 --> 44:32.169
Concerning respect, Your Majesty.

44:46.309 --> 44:48.686
Who is this George Washington?

44:48.770 --> 44:50.855
A famous American, Your Majesty.

44:50.939 --> 44:55.025
A Revolutionary general.
The first American president.

44:55.110 --> 44:57.486
Ah. Like Mr. Lenin in Russia?

44:58.488 --> 45:01.115
Not quite.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.909
Does he have a car?

45:03.994 --> 45:06.954
He lived a long time ago,
Your Majesty.

45:08.206 --> 45:10.207
I want a car.

45:15.088 --> 45:19.091
I think your mouse is trying to escape,
Your Majesty.

45:23.054 --> 45:25.639
Please do not tell anyone
about my mouse.

45:36.192 --> 45:38.819
The lesson is finished.

46:10.143 --> 46:13.187
The official taster's a brave man.

46:14.606 --> 46:17.191
Many of my ancestors
have been poisoned, you know.

46:21.071 --> 46:24.365
Does Your Majesty
have lunch like this every day?

46:24.449 --> 46:26.909
Ah, yes. Every day.
Like theater.

46:26.993 --> 46:29.870
I do not know why.
It has always been like that.

46:35.210 --> 46:37.544
How do they kill emperors in the West?

46:39.714 --> 46:42.591
The Austrian emperor was shot,
was he not?

46:42.676 --> 46:46.804
No. But his nephew was assassinated
before the Great War.

46:46.888 --> 46:50.140
But the Russian emperor has been shot.
He was called a czar.

46:50.225 --> 46:51.850
Yes.

46:51.935 --> 46:54.812
He took lots of our land in Manchuria.

46:54.896 --> 46:58.941
I'm a Manchurian. Even after the Republic,
it's still my country.

47:01.945 --> 47:06.615
The... secret, Your Majesty,
is emerging again.

47:23.925 --> 47:26.427
Is something the matter,
Your Majesty?

47:27.429 --> 47:29.097
Something is happening.

47:33.977 --> 47:36.020
What is happening, Mr. Johnston?

47:36.104 --> 47:38.188
- Nothing is--
- Quiet.

48:21.816 --> 48:27.196
On our way here, Your Majesty,
we were held up by students from the university.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.657
They were protesting
against the Republican government...

48:30.742 --> 48:34.787
because it has agreed to give away
Chinese territory to Japan.

48:36.081 --> 48:38.248
Is it true, Mr. Johnston...

48:38.333 --> 48:42.086
that many people out there
have had their heads chopped off?

48:42.170 --> 48:44.963
It is true, Your Majesty.

48:45.048 --> 48:47.716
Many heads have been chopped off.

48:49.260 --> 48:52.096
It does stop them thinking.

48:52.180 --> 48:54.098
It's time for the emperor's rest.

48:54.182 --> 48:57.101
The students are right to be angry.

49:02.357 --> 49:04.358
I'm angry.

49:06.402 --> 49:09.154
But I'm not allowed to leave
the Forbidden City.

49:11.032 --> 49:13.408
I want to go out, Mr. Johnston.

49:13.493 --> 49:16.161
My lord.

49:16.246 --> 49:18.747
I want to see the city of sounds.

49:27.549 --> 49:31.885
The emperor awards you
with the order of the Ruby Hat Button...

49:31.970 --> 49:36.598
and with the right to be carried
in your own chair with four bearers.

50:12.719 --> 50:16.972
<i>Ye'll take the high road
and I'll take the low road</i>

51:25.917 --> 51:28.001
I hope the emperor has not forgotten...

51:28.086 --> 51:31.171
that this is the day
for his maths class.

51:38.846 --> 51:40.764
For Your Majesty.

51:40.848 --> 51:43.809
My doctor said bicycles are bad for you.

51:43.893 --> 51:46.144
Bad for you? Nonsense!

51:54.570 --> 51:56.571
How does it work?

51:56.656 --> 51:58.615
Oh.

51:58.700 --> 52:01.368
It's simple.

52:01.452 --> 52:04.871
Head up and eyes forward.

52:06.165 --> 52:08.208
As in life.

52:32.150 --> 52:35.736
- My mother's dead, is she not?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

52:36.863 --> 52:38.864
I'm profoundly sorry.

52:38.948 --> 52:40.949
I am not.

52:44.495 --> 52:48.206
She killed herself.
She swallowed a ball of opium.

52:50.084 --> 52:53.170
I'm going to see her
and my brother.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.471
Open the door.

54:27.849 --> 54:29.850
Open the door!

54:41.696 --> 54:43.697
Open the door.

55:31.454 --> 55:33.872
Troublemaker!

55:33.956 --> 55:37.876
Devil! Meddler!

55:37.960 --> 55:40.504
Trouble. Nothing but trouble.

55:40.588 --> 55:45.300
- Look where you lead him.
- And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man!

55:45.384 --> 55:47.385
The boy's mother is dead...

55:47.470 --> 55:49.387
and he's not even allowed to see her!

55:49.472 --> 55:51.389
I want to go out!

55:51.474 --> 55:53.016
I want to go out!

55:53.100 --> 55:54.851
Stop that! Stay where you are!

55:54.936 --> 55:57.729
- I want to go out!
- Stop it!

55:57.813 --> 56:00.607
- I want to go out!
- Stay where you are! You fool!

56:00.691 --> 56:02.108
Stay there!

56:03.319 --> 56:05.779
Chang.

56:05.863 --> 56:07.864
Hunchback. Big Foot.

56:35.851 --> 56:37.852
Sir.

56:39.480 --> 56:40.981
Give me your hand, sir.

56:45.486 --> 56:47.821
Give me your hand, sir.

56:55.204 --> 56:57.163
Can you not see?

57:12.096 --> 57:14.639
Look at my left ear, please, sir.

57:14.724 --> 57:18.602
Thank you. And now my right.

57:18.686 --> 57:20.979
Thank you.

57:21.063 --> 57:23.023
Would you follow my finger,
please, sir?

57:29.405 --> 57:31.406
Mm-hmm.

57:31.490 --> 57:35.243
Well, it's perfectly simple, Johnston.
The emperor needs spectacles.

57:35.328 --> 57:37.579
Like Harold Lloyd.

57:37.663 --> 57:39.873
Impossible.

57:39.957 --> 57:41.833
An emperor does not wear spectacles.

57:41.917 --> 57:44.836
That cannot be allowed.

57:44.920 --> 57:48.131
Times have changed, Your Highnesses.

58:03.356 --> 58:06.900
If His Majesty doesn't get spectacles,
Johnston, he could lose his sight.

58:11.530 --> 58:14.115
Your Majesty.

58:31.509 --> 58:35.762
If the emperor does not get spectacles,
I will resign.

58:35.846 --> 58:39.015
Unfortunately, our decision is final.

58:39.100 --> 58:44.688
And unfortunately, what I have to say
will be published in every newspaper in China.

58:48.109 --> 58:50.694
What do you have to say, Mr. Johnston?

58:52.571 --> 58:56.783
The emperor has been a prisoner in his own palace
since the day that he was crowned...

58:56.867 --> 58:59.119
and has remained a prisoner
since he abdicated.

58:59.203 --> 59:01.371
But now he's growing up,
he may wonder why...

59:01.455 --> 59:05.959
he is the only person in China
who may not walk out of his own front door.

59:08.170 --> 59:11.548
I think the emperor
is the loneliest boy on earth.

59:13.759 --> 59:16.386
It would be conveniently sad...

59:16.470 --> 59:18.763
if he becomes blind.

59:18.848 --> 59:21.099
Blind, Mr. Johnston?

59:22.476 --> 59:24.853
To the expense, Your Excellency.

59:24.937 --> 59:28.606
To the cost of maintaining 1,200 eunuchs...

59:28.691 --> 59:34.070
350 ladies-in-waiting and 185 cooks.

59:34.155 --> 59:39.743
To buying 120 sable furs a month
and 3,000 chickens a week.

59:39.827 --> 59:44.914
To the fact that 840 guards and employees
of the household department...

59:44.999 --> 59:49.127
plus one lord chamberlain
care only about one thing:

59:49.211 --> 59:52.547
filling their own rice bowls.

59:52.631 --> 59:56.259
You are very good at accounts,
Mr. Johnston.

59:56.343 --> 59:59.304
The emperor may have abdicated...

59:59.388 --> 01:00:03.349
but he's still a symbol
of great importance to many people.

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:08.521
If I did not agree with that,
I would not be here.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.025
And some of us believe...

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:16.070
that one day soon
he may be more than a symbol.

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:19.574
The spectacles are a detail.

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:23.495
What do you really want, Mr. Johnston?

01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.580
Just the spectacles.

01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:30.043
Oh.

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:20.718
The princess Wan Jung, Your Majesty.

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:22.428
Seventeen years old.

01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:33.439
Princess Who Jen.
Fifteen years old.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.609
The princess Li Li, Your Majesty.

01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:40.280
And the Princess Fun Ying.

01:01:54.003 --> 01:01:56.546
Who is this?

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.923
Princess Wen Hsiu.
Twelve years old.

01:01:59.008 --> 01:02:01.134
She has got a funny face.

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:16.357
Not just one wife.
One empress and one secondary consort.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:19.736
- Two wives?
- But who did you choose to be the empress?

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.865
They chose her.
She's very old, Johnston. She's 17.

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:26.659
That's not so old, Your Majesty.

01:02:26.744 --> 01:02:29.704
- What does she look like?
- Old-fashioned.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.831
I want a modern wife, Johnston...

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:34.667
who speaks English and French.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.504
And who can dance the quickstep.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.809
Johnston.

01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:55.939
Sir.

01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:58.107
I'm going to escape, Johnston.

01:02:58.192 --> 01:03:01.277
I've got a suitcase
and a ticket to England.

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:03.738
I am going to Oxford University.

01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:10.870
Your Majesty, if you get married,
you will become the master of your own house.

01:03:10.955 --> 01:03:14.707
A wedding might be
a more practical way to escape.

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:53.162
Why did you never get married, Johnston?

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:55.248
Oh.

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.718
The secondary consort welcomes the empress.

01:04:06.802 --> 01:04:10.179
The empress greets the secondary consort.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.401
You do everything very well.

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.987
Thank you.
I rehearsed many times.

01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:27.757
What is His Majesty thinking?

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:32.887
I was thinking if I was a real emperor
I would become the ruler of China now.

01:05:34.056 --> 01:05:37.683
And what would the emperor do
if he could really rule?

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:40.978
I would change everything,
even the way we get married.

01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:45.149
Is the emperor against
arranged marriages?

01:05:45.234 --> 01:05:48.152
It is humiliating not to choose
whom you marry.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.614
Even I was not allowed to choose.

01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:09.590
In another year or two,
His Majesty will be taller than me.

01:06:11.552 --> 01:06:14.178
Is it true the emperor
has a suitcase under his bed...

01:06:14.263 --> 01:06:16.264
and is going to Oxford?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.892
Will the emperor take
Wan Jung with him?

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:25.314
Perhaps he would like to see my face
before he decides.

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:31.320
Yes. The emperor would like
to see the face of the empress.

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:39.662
It is the emperor who must remove
the <i>kai t'ou.</i>

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:43.976
I also had a tutor,
like Mr. Johnston.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.273
Miss Windsor.

01:07:52.486 --> 01:07:54.487
She's American.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.600
Miss Windsor taught me
how to do the dance of the quickstep.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.145
Does the emperor know
how to do the quickstep?

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:32.566
Will you teach me?

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:27.496
Leave us. Leave us.

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:49.477
If Your Majesty thinks...

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.856
it is old-fashioned to make the rain
and the wind with a stranger...

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.401
we can be like a modern couple
to begin with.

01:09:57.486 --> 01:09:59.320
A modern couple?

01:10:02.157 --> 01:10:05.242
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:15.628
You must come to Oxford with me.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.678
I like him.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:29.058
I am sure I am going to like him.

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:31.227
And he will grow up.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.565
Eyes down!

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:45.074
Report your arrival.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.785
- Prisoner 981 reporting.
- Louder!

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.830
Prisoner 981 reporting.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:53.124
Open the door.

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.756
Close the door.

01:11:02.217 --> 01:11:04.802
Sit down.

01:11:10.982 --> 01:11:12.017
Name.

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:14.061
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

01:11:14.146 --> 01:11:16.147
Write it.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.751
Now then.

01:11:37.836 --> 01:11:40.045
There are two types of confession.

01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:44.508
We call them toothpaste and water tap.

01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:49.805
The toothpaste prisoner
needs to be squeezed every now and then...

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:52.391
or else he forgets to keep confessing.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:58.606
The water tap man needs one good,
hard twist before he starts...

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:01.358
but then everything comes out.

01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:04.778
Now, you're an intelligent person.

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:07.990
I'm sure you understand me.

01:12:09.034 --> 01:12:10.951
Good.

01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:12.995
Then we'll begin.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:16.582
Why do you think you're in here, 981?

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:22.588
I am accused of being a traitor,
a collaborator and a counterrevolutionary.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:25.424
It is not an accusation!
You are a traitor...

01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:29.094
you are a collaborator,
and you are a counterrevolutionary!

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:38.562
Did you write this?

01:12:38.647 --> 01:12:40.564
And you call it a confession?

01:12:40.649 --> 01:12:44.610
This is nothing but a list of dates.
A child's fairy tale.

01:12:56.164 --> 01:12:58.832
- What do you want me to confess?
- You know what you did...

01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:00.834
and what others did.

01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:03.128
So why don't you volunteer the information?

01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:04.880
I do not understand.

01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:07.883
We don't tell people what to confess.

01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:09.927
We already know everything about you.

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:20.980
I...

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:26.068
- Go on.
- I wanted reforms.

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:28.904
What did you want to reform?

01:13:28.989 --> 01:13:30.698
Everything.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.827
Cut off my queue.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.413
Your Majesty. Please.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:17.494
- It is heavy.
- The emperor before me was murdered...

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:20.623
because he wanted to reform the empire.

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:22.625
Is that not so, Mr. Johnston?

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:25.711
Yes, Your Majesty. Probably.

01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:31.759
Well, let us see if they will kill me
for reforming the Forbidden City.

01:14:31.843 --> 01:14:34.261
Lord Chamberlain.

01:14:34.346 --> 01:14:39.266
I am appointing Mr. Johnston's friend,
the poet and scholar Chen Hsiao Hsiu...

01:14:39.351 --> 01:14:41.810
to be the new lord chamberlain.

01:14:41.895 --> 01:14:46.190
I want him to supervise
a detailed inventory of the imperial storerooms...

01:14:46.274 --> 01:14:50.736
so that we can learn exactly
how much has been stolen.

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:05.709
<i>The Forbidden City had become
a theater without an audience.</i>

01:15:05.794 --> 01:15:09.296
<i>So why did the actors
remain on the stage?</i>

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:14.426
<i>It was only to steal the scenery,
piece by piece.</i>

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:31.443
Can I sleep here?
I am frightened.

01:15:49.379 --> 01:15:51.547
You're brave.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:53.632
Are you not frightened?

01:15:54.801 --> 01:15:58.178
I am excited.
I do not want to escape anymore.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.974
I want to rule.

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:06.603
Kiss me.

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:40.179
Can I stay with you as well?

01:16:42.182 --> 01:16:44.850
Get in. Get in.

01:17:05.205 --> 01:17:08.081
I used to play a game
with the eunuchs.

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:14.838
Trying to guess who is who.

01:17:16.424 --> 01:17:18.592
Now I cannot see you.

01:17:27.227 --> 01:17:28.344
Wan Jung?

01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:30.330
Wen Hsiu?

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:35.734
Come underneath the sheet with us.

01:19:21.341 --> 01:19:24.843
Your Majesty.
The storerooms are on fire, Your Majesty.

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:42.569
<i>The fire was a terrible disaster...</i>

01:19:42.654 --> 01:19:47.532
<i>and I knew the eunuchs had started it
to stop me from knowing what they had stolen.</i>

01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:52.204
<i>There had been eunuchs
in the Forbidden City for 800 years.</i>

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.665
<i>There were still more
than a thousand of them.</i>

01:19:54.749 --> 01:19:57.125
<i>I decided to expel them all.</i>

01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:00.128
<i>I had to ask for Republican troops
to help me.</i>

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:08.655
- What are they carrying?
- Their organs.

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.241
Whatever their crimes...

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:15.620
they cannot be deprived of the right
to be buried as whole men.

01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:13.512
Well?

01:22:15.348 --> 01:22:17.349
Uh...

01:22:18.518 --> 01:22:21.436
- I have forgot what I was saying.
- You are wasting our time!

01:22:21.521 --> 01:22:24.397
We want to know about the Japanese.

01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:28.485
How did your friendship
with the Japanese begin?

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:30.028
Who introduced you? When?

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:35.492
I think it was...

01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:37.536
it was 1924.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:42.040
Parliament had been dissolved again.
The president had fled.

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:46.628
At first, I thought it was
just another coup d'état...

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:49.089
by just another warlord.

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:53.135
Only this time it was different.

01:22:54.387 --> 01:22:56.721
This time it was my turn.

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:01.059
Fifteen-love.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.331
Play.

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:32.924
30-15.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:07.709
The rotten government of the Republic
is in flight.

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:10.962
Now we shall remove the foreign stench
of the Manchurian rats...

01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:13.340
who still hide in the Forbidden City.

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:27.687
"Mr. Pu Yi and his family
have been given one hour...

01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:30.273
"to leave the Forbidden City.

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:36.446
"They will be escorted
to the home of his father...

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:39.991
"and remain there under guard
as state prisoners...

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:42.494
until further notice."

01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:50.335
What are you all looking at?

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:52.420
What are you standing there for?

01:24:52.505 --> 01:24:54.756
You always wanted to leave
the Forbidden City.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:57.842
Now you've got an hour to pack.
So go!

01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:00.845
Go!

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:16.069
I always thought I hated it here.

01:25:17.196 --> 01:25:19.572
Now I'm afraid to leave.

01:25:19.657 --> 01:25:22.826
- Do you think they will kill me?
- You must do as they say, Your Majesty...

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:25.537
while I try to reach
the British Embassy.

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.956
They will give you asylum there.

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:31.668
I'm sure they will.

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:36.214
Chang, take my car to the south gate.
I want you to drive His Majesty.

01:26:36.734 --> 01:26:38.985
Your Majesty!

01:27:26.534 --> 01:27:28.785
- Please, Your Majesty.
- What?

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:19.878
But you didn't go
to the British Embassy, did you?

01:28:19.962 --> 01:28:22.046
You ended up at the Japanese Embassy.

01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:25.049
The Japanese were the only people
prepared to help me.

01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:27.135
Help you for nothing?

01:28:28.846 --> 01:28:32.765
Japan has an emperor.
We are almost the same age.

01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:35.977
I thought it was kindness.

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:40.523
At the same time I realized that,
for many Chinese, I was an alien...

01:28:40.608 --> 01:28:43.860
simply because I am Manchurian.

01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:49.157
There was even an anti-Manchurian league
who wanted to assassinate me.

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:52.243
So I went to live in Tientsin.

01:28:53.871 --> 01:28:58.833
It was a nice, provincial town
with a big port.

01:28:58.918 --> 01:29:02.587
In those days they had
a large international settlement.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:05.465
The Japanese thought
it would be safer for me there.

01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:08.301
Were the Japanese paying for you
in Tientsin?

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:10.303
Oh, no.

01:29:10.387 --> 01:29:13.723
I had to rent a villa...
the Villa Chang.

01:29:13.807 --> 01:29:16.017
And it was very expensive.

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:18.269
So were the bodyguards.

01:29:19.271 --> 01:29:21.773
I spent a lot of money in Tientsin.

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:25.944
Did you still believe
in a restoration of the imperial system?

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:29.197
Others did.
The little court in exile.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.285
I cannot remember how much jade and jewelry
they made me spend...

01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:39.332
to buy the friendship of some warlord
or some White Russian general.

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:41.251
What else did you spend your money on?

01:29:41.335 --> 01:29:46.047
I was never tired of buying pianos,
watches, radios.

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:48.424
As long as they were foreign.

01:29:48.509 --> 01:29:50.426
Of course.

01:29:50.511 --> 01:29:52.637
Anything Western was good.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:56.933
Especially <i>Wrigley's Chewing Gum,
Bayer Aspirin,</i> and cars.

01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:59.352
While you were in Tientsin...

01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:03.231
most of China came under the control
of General Chiang Kai-shek...

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:05.567
the so-called nationalists...

01:30:05.651 --> 01:30:07.735
the Kuomintang.

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.989
- What were your relations with them?
- None.

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:16.369
I felt useless in Tientsin.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:19.080
I was 21.

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:22.417
I dreamt of going to the West.

01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:24.419
I became a playboy.

01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:28.673
<i>Am I blue</i>

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:31.759
<i>Am I blue</i>

01:30:31.844 --> 01:30:34.971
<i>Ain't these tears in my eyes</i>

01:30:35.055 --> 01:30:37.725
<i>Telling you</i>

01:30:38.809 --> 01:30:41.144
<i>Am I blue</i>

01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:44.147
<i>You'd be too</i>

01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:47.317
<i>If each plan with your girl</i>

01:30:47.401 --> 01:30:50.194
<i>Done fell through</i>

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.489
<i>Was a time</i>

01:30:53.574 --> 01:30:57.535
<i>I was her only one</i>

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.787
<i>But now</i>

01:30:59.872 --> 01:31:05.168
<i>I'm the sad and lonely one</i>

01:31:10.841 --> 01:31:14.719
<i>Now she's gone and we're through</i>

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:19.474
<i>Lord, I'm blue</i>

01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:21.559
Very good!

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:33.237
Well done!

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:11.442
That's a great ship
if you're going first class.

01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:16.906
I am not going anywhere.

01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:22.412
Would you like to dance?

01:32:32.214 --> 01:32:35.925
You are a brave man.
Nobody here would have danced with me.

01:32:36.009 --> 01:32:38.845
Why is that?

01:32:38.929 --> 01:32:40.680
Because I'm Chinese.

01:32:40.764 --> 01:32:43.099
Well, I'm American.

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:57.155
You say California.
I say French Riviera.

01:32:57.239 --> 01:32:59.073
San Francisco!

01:32:59.158 --> 01:33:01.576
Monte Carlo!

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.162
Are we really going this time?

01:33:13.422 --> 01:33:15.339
Who's that couple?

01:33:15.424 --> 01:33:18.342
Oh. Henry and Elizabeth.

01:33:18.427 --> 01:33:20.344
The emperor of China?

01:33:20.429 --> 01:33:22.764
The ex-emperor and his wife.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.852
- She's beautiful.
- Yes, very.

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:29.854
And who are you?

01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:33.274
- I am His Highness's other wife.
- His other wife?

01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:35.902
Number two wife.

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:38.196
Well, some people have all the luck.

01:33:54.171 --> 01:33:56.088
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:33:59.343 --> 01:34:01.886
General Chiang Kai-shek...

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.388
has taken Shanghai.

01:34:04.473 --> 01:34:07.391
The Kuomintang have broken with the Reds...

01:34:07.476 --> 01:34:09.393
and have knocked them for six!

01:34:09.478 --> 01:34:11.096
The Reds are finished!

01:34:17.903 --> 01:34:21.322
Sorry about the reception, everyone.
We'll get it fixed in a minute.

01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:24.909
It would be wiser to return
to the Japanese Legation now, Your Majesty.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:29.121
- Your car is waiting.
- Thank you, Mr. Amakasu.

01:34:29.206 --> 01:34:31.207
Here we go.

01:34:41.844 --> 01:34:46.180
<i>The general strike in Shanghai
has collapsed.</i>

01:34:46.265 --> 01:34:50.017
<i>The international settlement is safe.</i>

01:34:50.102 --> 01:34:52.019
<i>Troops of the Kuomintang...</i>

01:34:52.104 --> 01:34:54.564
<i>are now in full control of the city...</i>

01:34:54.648 --> 01:34:59.735
<i>and firm steps are being taken
to restore order in the native areas.</i>

01:35:09.496 --> 01:35:12.498
Wen Hsiu, you want some gum?

01:35:16.295 --> 01:35:18.296
I want a divorce.

01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:27.179
I do not want to be your mistress any longer.

01:35:27.264 --> 01:35:30.182
I thought you were my secondary consort.

01:35:30.267 --> 01:35:34.687
In the Forbidden City, you were the emperor
and I was your secondary consort.

01:35:35.814 --> 01:35:38.691
But now you are Henry Pu Yi.

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:41.611
Wan Yung is your wife, Elizabeth.

01:35:43.405 --> 01:35:45.573
And who am I?

01:35:46.867 --> 01:35:48.119
I'm nobody.

01:35:58.503 --> 01:36:01.672
I did not know you were so unhappy.

01:36:06.178 --> 01:36:09.180
You can only have one wife in the West.

01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:16.729
I want a divorce.

01:36:16.813 --> 01:36:18.814
No one can divorce me.

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:45.383
I want a divorce!

01:37:20.752 --> 01:37:22.753
Your Ladyship!

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.881
Your Ladyship!

01:37:32.347 --> 01:37:34.348
Thank you.

01:37:48.655 --> 01:37:50.656
I do not need it!

01:37:54.828 --> 01:37:56.829
I do not need it.

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:27.352
Wen Hsiu.

01:38:39.372 --> 01:38:42.208
Elizabeth, can I come in?

01:38:42.292 --> 01:38:44.585
Don't you remember me?

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:47.713
I'm dressed like a pilot,
but I still can't fly. Not yet.

01:38:47.798 --> 01:38:51.217
Eastern Jewel!
We had dancing classes together.

01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:53.469
Yes, just before your marriage.

01:38:53.553 --> 01:38:57.181
You silly girl.
Why do people want to get married?

01:38:57.265 --> 01:38:59.850
Wen Hsiu has gone.

01:38:59.935 --> 01:39:01.852
She will never come back.

01:39:01.937 --> 01:39:03.938
Is that so bad?

01:39:05.107 --> 01:39:07.274
She was my only friend.

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:12.113
Well, at least now you've got
your husband all to yourself.

01:39:13.782 --> 01:39:15.783
And you've got me!

01:39:17.202 --> 01:39:19.453
I'll be your friend.

01:39:19.538 --> 01:39:21.622
- You smoke opium?
- Be wicked.

01:39:21.706 --> 01:39:23.707
It's the best in Shanghai.

01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:27.294
Why are you going to Europe?

01:39:27.379 --> 01:39:30.798
The place to go is Japan.
It's more fun than anywhere.

01:39:32.134 --> 01:39:34.885
It's modern.

01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:38.764
How do you know we are going to Europe?
It is a secret.

01:39:38.849 --> 01:39:41.058
Oh, I know everything.

01:39:41.143 --> 01:39:45.229
I know Chiang Kai-shek
has got false teeth.

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:48.315
I even know his nickname--
"Cash My Check!"

01:39:52.195 --> 01:39:54.822
I'm a spy...

01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:57.116
and I don't care who knows it.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.870
- A spy?
- I work for the Japanese Special Service Bureau.

01:40:00.954 --> 01:40:03.455
And I've come to protect you.

01:40:04.457 --> 01:40:07.001
The Japanese...

01:40:07.085 --> 01:40:10.171
They are getting closer to him every day.

01:40:11.256 --> 01:40:15.634
He is sending his brother
to the military academy in Tokyo.

01:40:15.719 --> 01:40:18.929
They talk to him about Manchuria
all the time.

01:40:20.056 --> 01:40:22.975
And Mr. Amakasu never says hello to me.

01:40:23.059 --> 01:40:24.977
I do not trust the Japanese.

01:40:36.698 --> 01:40:39.617
Of course, I'd love to be
the emperor's new secondary consort.

01:40:39.701 --> 01:40:43.329
- Eastern Jewel.
- If the post is available.

01:41:01.848 --> 01:41:04.850
The post is vacant, my dear cousin.

01:41:06.645 --> 01:41:09.146
But you do not fit the part.

01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:14.818
Wen Hsiu left the dog behind.
Do you want it?

01:41:16.905 --> 01:41:19.240
It is my fault.

01:41:19.324 --> 01:41:21.575
It is all my fault.

01:41:53.984 --> 01:41:56.485
I came to see you, Your Majesty...

01:41:56.569 --> 01:41:58.570
to give you bad news.

01:41:59.864 --> 01:42:02.032
Something terrible has happened.

01:42:07.872 --> 01:42:10.791
The imperial tombs
of our Manchurian ancestors...

01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:13.585
have been attacked and robbed...

01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:16.797
by troops of the Kuomintang.

01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:19.258
Chinese soldiers.

01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:21.510
A warlord working for Chiang Kai-shek.

01:42:25.348 --> 01:42:28.767
The body of the Empress Dowager...

01:42:28.852 --> 01:42:30.853
was hacked to pieces.

01:42:32.856 --> 01:42:37.151
Her pearl necklace has become
a wedding present from Chiang Kai-shek...

01:42:37.235 --> 01:42:39.236
to his new wife.

01:43:01.009 --> 01:43:03.802
Tell me, 981,
do you consider yourself to be Chinese?

01:43:03.887 --> 01:43:05.804
Of course.

01:43:05.889 --> 01:43:07.806
- What is this?
- Japan.

01:43:07.891 --> 01:43:10.684
- And what do you call this part of China?
- The northeast.

01:43:10.769 --> 01:43:14.021
- And what did you call it as a child?
- Manchuria.

01:43:14.105 --> 01:43:18.150
Japan invaded Manchuria
on September 18, 1931...

01:43:18.234 --> 01:43:21.153
and began to set up
a puppet state called Manchukuo.

01:43:21.237 --> 01:43:25.449
Shortly afterwards, a Japanese delegation
paid you a secret visit in Tientsin...

01:43:25.533 --> 01:43:27.451
to request your collaboration.

01:43:27.535 --> 01:43:29.453
Would you say you refused?

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:32.039
- Speak up!
- I already told you.

01:43:32.123 --> 01:43:35.376
- I have told you a hundred times.
- Tell us again. Tell us 200 times.

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.378
I refused to collaborate.

01:43:37.462 --> 01:43:39.380
You say you refused.

01:43:39.464 --> 01:43:44.760
But a month later, on November 10, 1931,
there you are arriving in Manchuria.

01:43:44.844 --> 01:43:47.054
Or should I call it Manchukuo?

01:43:47.138 --> 01:43:50.557
Now, according to this
so-called confession of yours...

01:43:50.642 --> 01:43:52.559
you didn't go of your own free will.

01:43:52.644 --> 01:43:54.978
You insist that you were kidnapped
by the Japanese!

01:43:55.063 --> 01:43:57.106
- Yes.
- And taken to Manchuria by force.

01:43:57.190 --> 01:43:59.775
- Yes!
- Sit down.

01:44:02.862 --> 01:44:06.949
Do you remember a man called
Reginald Fleming Johnston?

01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:10.702
He was your tutor.

01:44:10.787 --> 01:44:12.704
Yes.

01:44:12.789 --> 01:44:15.290
And a good friend, I believe.

01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:19.878
After 28 years in China...

01:44:19.963 --> 01:44:22.923
Mr. Johnston returned to England.

01:44:23.007 --> 01:44:27.803
He became a professor of Oriental Studies
at London University...

01:44:28.847 --> 01:44:31.181
and he wrote a book.

01:44:31.266 --> 01:44:34.351
It is called
<i>Twilight in the Forbidden City...</i>

01:44:34.436 --> 01:44:36.937
and it is dedicated to you.

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:54.538
Bye now!

01:44:54.622 --> 01:44:56.540
- Bye!
- Good-bye!

01:44:56.624 --> 01:44:59.376
- Don't forget to write!
- Bye, Mom!

01:45:04.632 --> 01:45:07.759
I am going to miss you, Johnston.

01:45:07.844 --> 01:45:10.762
I shall miss you, Your Majesty.

01:45:14.184 --> 01:45:18.479
Do you think a man
can become emperor again?

01:45:18.563 --> 01:45:20.105
Yes.

01:45:38.917 --> 01:45:41.126
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:46.965
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard!

01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:49.051
How can we say good-bye?

01:45:50.762 --> 01:45:52.763
As we said hello.

01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:07.402
Farewell, Mr. Johnston.

01:46:07.487 --> 01:46:09.488
Farewell, Your Majesty.

01:46:15.453 --> 01:46:18.623
All aboard! All aboard!

01:46:19.707 --> 01:46:20.625
Thank you.

01:46:21.309 --> 01:46:22.310
Thank you.

01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:26.838
- All aboard!
- All aboard!

01:46:30.802 --> 01:46:32.803
All aboard now!

01:46:34.597 --> 01:46:37.349
All aboard!

01:46:45.523 --> 01:46:47.067
All aboard!

01:46:56.744 --> 01:46:58.829
Good-bye, Mr. Johnston!

01:46:58.913 --> 01:47:01.999
We'll never forget you, Mr. Johnston!

01:47:02.083 --> 01:47:05.752
Good-bye!
Mr. Johnston, good-bye!

01:47:05.837 --> 01:47:08.297
- Good-bye!
- All aboard!

01:47:11.134 --> 01:47:15.804
On page 449...

01:47:15.888 --> 01:47:17.806
Mr. Johnston writes:

01:47:17.890 --> 01:47:23.478
"The endeavor to make out that the emperor
had been kidnapped by the Japanese...

01:47:23.563 --> 01:47:25.814
"is wholly untrue.

01:47:27.191 --> 01:47:29.776
"He left Tientsin and went to Manchuria...

01:47:29.861 --> 01:47:31.778
of his own free will."

01:47:31.863 --> 01:47:34.698
- Johnston was a liar.
- What did you say?

01:47:34.782 --> 01:47:39.036
Mr. Johnston had left
before I was taken to Manchuria.

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:41.496
He could not have known what happened.

01:47:58.264 --> 01:48:00.265
Sit down.

01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:11.777
According to this account, you prepared
the man's things on the morning of November 9.

01:48:11.861 --> 01:48:14.029
Isn't it unusual for a man
who is kidnapped...

01:48:14.113 --> 01:48:17.240
to have his luggage packed by his valet
the day before he is kidnapped?

01:48:17.325 --> 01:48:21.078
This is what you have written, isn't it?
Who told you to pack this man's luggage?

01:48:24.666 --> 01:48:27.292
These two stories don't fit, do they?

01:48:29.337 --> 01:48:32.005
It was a long time ago.

01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:34.174
Perhaps I made a mistake.

01:48:34.258 --> 01:48:37.135
You are lying!
You are both lying!

01:48:38.012 --> 01:48:40.013
Control yourself!

01:48:46.354 --> 01:48:48.522
You can still change your mind.

01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:58.740
I am the hereditary ruler
of the Manchurian people.

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:05.038
There can be no Manchukuo without me.

01:49:05.123 --> 01:49:08.625
Do you not see?
The Japanese are using you.

01:49:09.627 --> 01:49:12.379
I must try to use them.

01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:16.341
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria
will be condemned by the League of Nations...

01:49:16.426 --> 01:49:18.593
and by every civilized country on Earth.

01:49:18.678 --> 01:49:22.180
The Chinese Republic has broken
every promise it ever made to me.

01:49:22.265 --> 01:49:25.851
Chinese troops desecrated
the tombs of my ancestors.

01:49:25.935 --> 01:49:29.146
And Chinese troops did not
defend Manchuria from the Japanese.

01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:31.982
But Manchuria is still China!

01:49:32.066 --> 01:49:35.736
- China has turned its back on me.
- Please, do not go.

01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:39.156
Manchuria is the richest frontier in Asia.

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:41.867
Coal, oil, railways!

01:49:41.951 --> 01:49:44.911
Millions of Chinese immigrants
are going there every year.

01:49:44.996 --> 01:49:46.913
I'm going to build my country.

01:49:46.998 --> 01:49:50.417
Johnston was wrong,
but he wasn't a liar.

01:49:50.501 --> 01:49:52.961
There was no kidnapping.

01:49:53.045 --> 01:49:57.966
You went to Manchuria by your own choice
because you wanted to be emperor again!

01:50:14.066 --> 01:50:17.068
These might help you
to remember the truth.

01:51:55.877 --> 01:51:57.878
To heaven.

01:52:04.785 --> 01:52:06.304
To earth.

01:52:07.388 --> 01:52:09.472
To the moon.

01:52:12.351 --> 01:52:14.811
To the sun.

01:52:31.495 --> 01:52:33.496
You're an empress again.

01:52:34.999 --> 01:52:37.500
What I'm going to be is a pilot.

01:52:37.585 --> 01:52:41.755
I'm going to train at a secret base near Yokohama
to learn precision bombing.

01:52:43.049 --> 01:52:45.467
I want to bomb Shanghai.

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:48.970
Bomb Shanghai?

01:52:49.055 --> 01:52:51.056
I hate China.

01:52:57.146 --> 01:52:59.147
I hate you.

01:54:18.561 --> 01:54:22.897
The Japanese army high command.
Very impressive!

01:54:24.025 --> 01:54:26.776
The Japanese army!

01:54:36.244 --> 01:54:37.245
Quickly!

01:54:55.681 --> 01:54:58.099
On behalf of the emperor of Japan...

01:54:58.184 --> 01:55:03.229
the commander of the Kwangtung Army
extends his warmest congratulations...

01:55:03.314 --> 01:55:06.816
on the occasion of His Majesty's coronation.

01:55:49.026 --> 01:55:50.944
Ah, yes.

01:55:54.782 --> 01:55:57.700
Manchukuo will grow into a great nation.

01:55:57.785 --> 01:56:01.120
Japan will always be
at her side to help her.

01:57:02.391 --> 01:57:05.101
Uh, may I introduce you?

01:57:05.185 --> 01:57:07.479
My wife, the Princess Hiro Saga.

01:57:08.564 --> 01:57:10.773
Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu.

01:57:15.779 --> 01:57:18.907
The Honorable Chang Chinghui,
Minister of Defense.

01:57:20.993 --> 01:57:23.162
The Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Colonna.

01:57:38.594 --> 01:57:42.305
The empress and I
accept with great pleasure...

01:57:49.313 --> 01:57:51.397
Excuse me, General.

01:58:14.296 --> 01:58:17.548
Ah, and our Mr. Amakasu...

01:58:17.633 --> 01:58:21.803
is the new chief of
the Manchurian Motion Picture Studios.

01:58:31.146 --> 01:58:34.524
Why do you have to spoil this day?

01:58:34.608 --> 01:58:36.609
Why?

01:58:38.153 --> 01:58:43.116
Mr. Amakasu is
the most powerful man in Manchukuo.

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:45.451
What are you talking about?

01:58:46.495 --> 01:58:50.873
You did not believe
I could be emperor again, but I am.

01:58:50.958 --> 01:58:52.959
You are blind.

01:59:02.678 --> 01:59:06.597
Do you know what it means to be an empress?
You are an empress.

01:59:10.769 --> 01:59:12.937
Why do you not make love to me anymore?

01:59:13.022 --> 01:59:14.981
Because you have become an opium addict.

01:59:16.734 --> 01:59:20.028
Opium killed my mother.
Opium destroyed China.

01:59:20.112 --> 01:59:22.655
You can buy opium anywhere in Manchukuo.

01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:24.657
- Shut up.
- In any shop.

01:59:24.742 --> 01:59:27.035
Shut up!

01:59:29.455 --> 01:59:31.914
Your brother is going to have a child.

01:59:34.501 --> 01:59:36.502
We must have a child.

01:59:37.671 --> 01:59:40.256
You must have an heir.

01:59:41.675 --> 01:59:45.595
Emperor Hirohito has officially
invited us to Japan.

01:59:47.056 --> 01:59:49.098
I'm going alone.

01:59:49.183 --> 01:59:51.559
You are staying here.

01:59:51.643 --> 01:59:53.978
I will never go to Japan.

01:59:54.063 --> 01:59:56.064
Then go to your room.

02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:06.032
Ten thousand years
to His Majesty the Emperor!

02:00:07.868 --> 02:00:10.244
- Ten thousand years!
- Ten thousand years!

02:00:10.329 --> 02:00:14.832
Ten thousand years
to His Majesty, the Emperor!

02:00:14.917 --> 02:00:17.127
Ten thousand years!

02:00:22.758 --> 02:00:24.675
Ten thousand years!

02:00:29.848 --> 02:00:34.560
Ten thousand years!
Ten thousand years!

02:01:19.731 --> 02:01:22.733
I told you I hate you.

02:01:25.237 --> 02:01:28.239
Only because I give you
what you need.

02:02:02.649 --> 02:02:04.567
Now we're engaged.

02:03:00.874 --> 02:03:03.876
- You forgot my tooth powder.
- Oh.

02:03:03.961 --> 02:03:05.962
Yes, sir.

02:03:24.606 --> 02:03:26.607
Move him.

02:03:31.113 --> 02:03:33.322
981, collect your things.

02:03:43.208 --> 02:03:45.209
Upstairs!

02:03:49.381 --> 02:03:51.382
Stop.

02:03:59.099 --> 02:04:02.059
Your laces are undone.
Do them up.

02:04:02.144 --> 02:04:05.438
Thursday you serve lunch.
Friday you clean the toilet.

02:04:05.522 --> 02:04:07.690
Saturday you sweep the floor.

02:04:35.344 --> 02:04:38.429
I have never been separated
from my family.

02:04:38.513 --> 02:04:40.681
You'd better get used to it.

02:04:45.604 --> 02:04:48.022
You do not remember me, do you?

02:04:48.106 --> 02:04:51.650
I was the minister of trade in Manchukuo.

02:04:55.697 --> 02:04:57.865
You were all in Manchukuo.

02:04:59.868 --> 02:05:01.786
Now I am the cell leader.

02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:06.332
It is important to follow the rules here.
No talking during study sessions.

02:05:59.678 --> 02:06:01.595
Where is your gun, Captain?

02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:03.597
Where are their swords?

02:06:03.682 --> 02:06:06.183
Our weapons have been removed,
Your Majesty...

02:06:06.268 --> 02:06:08.936
on the orders of Colonel Yoshioka.

02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:11.313
Colonel Yoshioka?

02:06:12.816 --> 02:06:16.193
- Colonel Yoshioka.
- What has happened here?

02:06:16.278 --> 02:06:18.487
Why has my guard been disarmed?

02:06:18.572 --> 02:06:21.073
Yes, it is very unfortunate,
Your Majesty.

02:06:21.158 --> 02:06:24.076
There have been many changes
while you were in Tokyo.

02:06:24.161 --> 02:06:27.830
Your Majesty, may I present
Masaomi Kobayakawa...

02:06:27.914 --> 02:06:31.792
the new Japanese ambassador to Manchukuo.

02:06:57.819 --> 02:07:00.946
Why is Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu
not here to receive me?

02:07:01.031 --> 02:07:04.283
The prime minister has resigned,
Your Majesty.

02:07:04.367 --> 02:07:06.785
His son has been assassinated.

02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:08.787
Assassinated?

02:07:08.872 --> 02:07:11.999
By Communist bandits, Your Majesty.

02:07:18.590 --> 02:07:20.758
I must see him at once.

02:07:20.842 --> 02:07:23.719
He refuses to see anyone, Your Majesty.

02:07:23.803 --> 02:07:26.263
He has gone to a monastery...

02:07:26.348 --> 02:07:28.557
far away.

02:07:35.690 --> 02:07:38.192
Who are you?

02:07:38.276 --> 02:07:40.945
Chang Chinghui, Your Majesty...

02:07:41.029 --> 02:07:43.447
Minister of Defense.

02:07:44.616 --> 02:07:46.617
Yes.

02:07:48.286 --> 02:07:50.287
Of course.

02:07:52.082 --> 02:07:55.334
The council meeting will be at 4:00,
Your Majesty...

02:07:55.418 --> 02:07:57.711
before the state dinner.

02:08:08.598 --> 02:08:13.143
"The emperor has been asked
to sign the following.

02:08:13.228 --> 02:08:15.145
"After careful consideration...

02:08:15.230 --> 02:08:18.732
"we have decided to nominate
the Honorable Chang Chinghui...

02:08:18.817 --> 02:08:22.319
as the new prime minister of Manchukuo."

02:08:28.784 --> 02:08:29.702
No.

02:08:29.786 --> 02:08:32.204
Today, on our return from Japan...

02:08:32.289 --> 02:08:36.000
we wish to speak
of something more important...

02:08:36.084 --> 02:08:39.336
the future of our friendship with Japan.

02:08:40.422 --> 02:08:43.924
This is based on mutual respect.

02:08:44.009 --> 02:08:47.636
And respect means
equality and independence.

02:08:47.721 --> 02:08:53.183
When the two emperors stood together
and saluted the two national flags...

02:08:53.268 --> 02:08:56.520
they recognized that Manchukuo
had come of age.

02:08:56.605 --> 02:08:59.982
Manchukuo is not a colony.
Manchukuo is Manchuria.

02:09:03.903 --> 02:09:06.238
The relationship between our two countries...

02:09:06.323 --> 02:09:09.241
is like the relationship
between its two emperors.

02:09:09.326 --> 02:09:11.744
It is rooted in fraternal trust...

02:09:11.828 --> 02:09:13.746
in--

02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:18.083
in the desire to preserve
our ancient traditions...

02:09:18.168 --> 02:09:21.962
and in a mutual respect
for our national identities!

02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:26.258
Already we have welcomed the ambassadors...

02:09:26.343 --> 02:09:30.471
of El Salvador, Costa Rica, the Vatican.

02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:35.768
Soon, I'm-- I'm sure
the other countries will follow.

02:09:54.829 --> 02:09:57.831
I'm going to have a child.

02:10:01.169 --> 02:10:03.170
The father is Manchurian.

02:10:08.677 --> 02:10:10.594
Colonel Yoshioka and Mr. Amakasu!

02:10:10.679 --> 02:10:12.680
I did it for you.

02:10:35.245 --> 02:10:38.956
His Majesty forgot to sign
the appointment of the new prime minister...

02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:41.208
Mr. Chang Chinghui.

02:10:42.252 --> 02:10:44.253
I did not forget.

02:10:51.136 --> 02:10:53.303
When an Englishman robs someone,
Your Majesty...

02:10:53.388 --> 02:10:55.597
he becomes a gentleman.

02:10:55.682 --> 02:10:59.435
If he robs a lot,
he becomes a knight.

02:10:59.519 --> 02:11:03.856
Do you imagine the British
run their empire as a charity?

02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:08.694
If India has paid for the cost
of its own occupation...

02:11:08.778 --> 02:11:11.071
so must Manchukuo!

02:11:24.961 --> 02:11:28.297
We hope Manchukuo will have an heir.

02:11:30.967 --> 02:11:33.010
The empress is expecting a child.

02:11:33.094 --> 02:11:36.513
Yes, Your Majesty.
We are aware of the situation.

02:11:42.896 --> 02:11:45.397
This is the name of the father.

02:11:53.907 --> 02:11:56.533
His name is Chang.

02:11:56.618 --> 02:11:58.619
He is your driver.

02:12:17.388 --> 02:12:20.516
All the necessary facts have been recorded.

02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:23.185
The man will be punished.

02:12:23.269 --> 02:12:27.314
The emperor cannot allow
his honor to be stained.

02:12:43.665 --> 02:12:48.085
The Japanese are the only divine race on earth.

02:12:48.169 --> 02:12:52.881
We will take China, Hong Kong, Indochina...

02:12:52.966 --> 02:12:55.300
Siam, Malaya...

02:12:55.385 --> 02:12:58.470
Singapore and India!

02:12:58.555 --> 02:13:00.973
Asia belongs to us!

02:13:32.463 --> 02:13:35.465
There have been complaints
from your cell mates.

02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:39.803
You must learn how to urinate at night
without waking them all up.

02:13:41.681 --> 02:13:46.602
The way to do it is to urinate
against the side of the bucket...

02:13:46.686 --> 02:13:48.604
not into the middle.

02:13:48.688 --> 02:13:50.689
Yes, comrade.

02:14:05.079 --> 02:14:08.081
You still think I am your servant,
don't you?

02:14:30.939 --> 02:14:33.357
You are all pretending.

02:14:33.441 --> 02:14:35.859
You are just pretending
you have changed.

02:14:35.944 --> 02:14:40.030
Shut up! The party teaches us to be new men
while working for a new China!

02:14:40.114 --> 02:14:42.824
You worked in Amakasu's private office.

02:14:42.909 --> 02:14:46.912
You are still the same people.
People do not change.

02:14:46.996 --> 02:14:49.206
Guard! Guard!

02:14:55.755 --> 02:14:57.673
Guard!

02:14:57.757 --> 02:15:00.467
- I let it happen.
- Guard!

02:15:00.551 --> 02:15:03.553
- Guard!
- I let it happen.

02:15:39.757 --> 02:15:42.175
The second edict, Your Majesty.

02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:46.096
Japanese will be the official language
in Manchukuo schools.

02:15:58.991 --> 02:16:00.235
Your Majesty!

02:16:05.074 --> 02:16:06.992
The baby was born dead, Your Majesty.

02:16:07.076 --> 02:16:09.327
How is the empress?

02:16:09.412 --> 02:16:12.372
It will be better if she goes to a clinic.
Somewhere warm.

02:16:16.294 --> 02:16:18.179
She's already left, Your Majesty.

02:17:10.764 --> 02:17:13.266
Open the door.

02:18:12.826 --> 02:18:15.704
<i>With Manchukuo now firmly in their grasp...</i>

02:18:15.788 --> 02:18:19.457
<i>the Japanese soon controlled
most of North China.</i>

02:18:19.541 --> 02:18:22.919
<i>By 1937 they were ready to strike south...</i>

02:18:23.004 --> 02:18:25.714
<i>at the heart of the country.</i>

02:18:25.798 --> 02:18:30.510
<i>The attack on Shanghai was one
of the first civilian bombing raids in history.</i>

02:18:31.512 --> 02:18:34.931
<i>It left thousands homeless,
thousands dead.</i>

02:18:40.897 --> 02:18:46.651
<i>Three months later, Japanese armies
were besieging the provisional capital at Nanking...</i>

02:18:46.736 --> 02:18:50.362
<i>and when the city fell
the atrocities began.</i>

02:18:52.032 --> 02:18:56.244
<i>Trying to terrorize the rest of China
into surrender...</i>

02:18:56.329 --> 02:18:59.206
<i>the Japanese high command
ordered a massacre.</i>

02:18:59.290 --> 02:19:03.877
<i>More than 200,000 civilians
were systematically executed.</i>

02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:06.922
<i>The world watched in horror...</i>

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:09.174
<i>but no help was given.</i>

02:19:09.258 --> 02:19:12.593
<i>On December 7, 1941...</i>

02:19:12.678 --> 02:19:16.973
<i>Japan attacked the American fleet
at Pearl Harbor.</i>

02:19:17.058 --> 02:19:18.892
<i>There was no warning.</i>

02:19:19.936 --> 02:19:23.730
<i>Manchukuo, the Japanese bastion
in North China...</i>

02:19:23.814 --> 02:19:27.275
<i>was still ruled
by the puppet emperor Pu Yi.</i>

02:19:29.028 --> 02:19:31.571
<i>But behind the facade of triumph...</i>

02:19:31.656 --> 02:19:35.075
<i>was a country enslaved...</i>

02:19:35.159 --> 02:19:39.663
<i>a country where Japanese experiments
in biological warfare...</i>

02:19:39.746 --> 02:19:43.708
<i>were carried out on live human beings...</i>

02:19:43.793 --> 02:19:49.256
<i>a country where opium production
became the easiest way to finance the war.</i>

02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:54.886
<i>Millions of people
were deliberately turned into drug addicts.</i>

02:20:20.037 --> 02:20:24.207
<i>Nine days after the bomb at Hiroshima...</i>

02:20:24.292 --> 02:20:27.669
<i>on August 15, 1945...</i>

02:20:27.753 --> 02:20:31.589
<i>Emperor Hirohito announced
the surrender of Japan.</i>

02:20:32.633 --> 02:20:36.761
<i>It was the first time his voice
had ever been heard on radio.</i>

02:21:21.307 --> 02:21:23.725
You must get to Tokyo, Your Majesty.

02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:26.436
You must surrender to the Americans,
not the Russians.

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:29.022
The Communists will kill everyone.

02:22:14.443 --> 02:22:16.986
The empress has returned.

02:22:25.245 --> 02:22:26.746
Majesty, please.

02:22:31.877 --> 02:22:33.878
Your Majesty!

02:23:26.891 --> 02:23:29.851
Hurry! There is no room on the plane,
Your Majesty!

02:23:29.935 --> 02:23:33.438
The women are not in danger!
We must hurry!

02:24:29.703 --> 02:24:32.914
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty is leaving now!

02:24:32.998 --> 02:24:34.999
Now!

02:25:10.494 --> 02:25:12.495
The Russians!

02:25:50.659 --> 02:25:55.371
Perhaps you think we are here
to teach men to lie in a new way.

02:25:55.456 --> 02:25:58.833
Why did you sign
every accusation made against you?

02:25:58.917 --> 02:26:02.587
I didn't stop you from killing yourself
to see you like this...

02:26:03.589 --> 02:26:08.259
someone who signs anything
to please his enemies, to please me!

02:26:08.344 --> 02:26:11.596
You knew about a lot of things in Manchukuo...

02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:13.931
even the secret agreement...

02:26:14.016 --> 02:26:15.933
but you couldn't possibly have known...

02:26:16.018 --> 02:26:19.646
about the Japanese biological
warfare experiments in Harbin.

02:26:19.730 --> 02:26:21.731
Could you?

02:26:23.067 --> 02:26:26.402
So why did you sign these papers?

02:26:30.491 --> 02:26:32.909
I was responsible for everything.

02:26:32.993 --> 02:26:35.662
You are responsible for what you do!

02:26:36.914 --> 02:26:39.999
All your life you thought
you were better than everyone else.

02:26:40.084 --> 02:26:43.086
Now you think you are the worst of all!

02:26:48.967 --> 02:26:51.302
Why can you not leave me alone?

02:26:53.639 --> 02:26:57.934
You saved my life
to make me a puppet in your own play.

02:26:58.018 --> 02:27:00.937
You saved me because I am useful to you.

02:27:01.021 --> 02:27:04.107
Is that so terrible...

02:27:04.191 --> 02:27:06.442
to be useful?

02:27:38.892 --> 02:27:40.601
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

02:27:45.524 --> 02:27:50.570
By order of the Supreme People's Court...

02:27:50.654 --> 02:27:54.907
the war criminal Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...

02:27:54.992 --> 02:27:58.411
male, 53 years old...

02:27:58.495 --> 02:28:00.997
of the Manchu nationality...

02:28:01.081 --> 02:28:02.999
and from Peking...

02:28:03.083 --> 02:28:06.043
has now served 10 years' detention.

02:28:06.128 --> 02:28:11.174
As a result of remolding through labor...

02:28:11.258 --> 02:28:15.845
and ideological education
during his captivity...

02:28:15.929 --> 02:28:19.348
he has shown that he has
genuinely reformed.

02:28:19.433 --> 02:28:25.021
In accordance with clause one
of the Special Pardon Order...

02:28:25.105 --> 02:28:29.150
he is therefore to be released.

02:28:40.204 --> 02:28:42.121
You see?

02:28:42.206 --> 02:28:46.250
I will end up living in prison
longer than you.

02:31:19.029 --> 02:31:20.531
The Red Guards.

02:31:28.330 --> 02:31:30.331
They are so young.

02:31:31.667 --> 02:31:33.751
It is dangerous.

02:31:39.967 --> 02:31:41.717
Look.

02:31:41.802 --> 02:31:44.804
Over there. Pu Chieh, look!

02:31:48.225 --> 02:31:51.060
It is the governor of our prison!

02:31:51.144 --> 02:31:53.062
- It cannot be.
- It is!

02:31:53.146 --> 02:31:55.064
I'm sure it is!

02:31:57.567 --> 02:31:59.568
Be careful.

02:32:00.862 --> 02:32:03.531
Come back!

02:32:46.992 --> 02:32:50.036
Comrade, this must be a mistake.

02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:52.413
I know this man.
He is a good man.

02:32:52.497 --> 02:32:55.416
- Who are you?
- I am a gardener.

02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:58.502
Join us, comrade, or fuck off!

02:33:07.721 --> 02:33:09.638
But what has he done?

02:33:09.723 --> 02:33:12.224
- He has been accused.
- Accused of what?

02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:14.268
- Emperor's lackey!
- Revisionist element!

02:33:14.352 --> 02:33:16.479
Rotten rightist!

02:33:16.563 --> 02:33:19.482
- Confess your crime.
- I have nothing to confess.

02:33:19.566 --> 02:33:21.317
Kowtow to Chairman Mao.

02:33:25.238 --> 02:33:28.199
- Confess your crimes.
- I have nothing to confess.

02:33:28.283 --> 02:33:30.034
Kowtow!

02:33:33.371 --> 02:33:35.998
- Confess your crimes!
- Wait!

02:33:36.083 --> 02:33:39.001
He's a teacher!
He is a good teacher!

02:33:39.086 --> 02:33:42.421
- You-- You cannot do this to him!
- Move! Move!

02:33:42.506 --> 02:33:45.508
You are wrong!
He is a good teacher!

02:36:47.107 --> 02:36:50.025
Stop!

02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:53.737
You are not allowed in there!

02:36:57.117 --> 02:36:59.034
- Who are you?
- I live here.

02:36:59.119 --> 02:37:01.036
I am the son of the guardian.

02:37:01.121 --> 02:37:03.747
Ah, well, I used to live here too.

02:37:03.832 --> 02:37:07.751
- That is where I sat.
- Who are you?

02:37:07.836 --> 02:37:10.629
I was the emperor of China.

02:37:10.714 --> 02:37:12.715
Prove it!

02:38:51.898 --> 02:38:54.316
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony...

02:38:54.401 --> 02:38:56.318
where the emperors were crowned.

02:38:56.403 --> 02:39:00.322
The last emperor to be crowned here
was Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

02:39:00.407 --> 02:39:02.324
He was three years old.

02:39:02.409 --> 02:39:05.744
He died in 1967.
