00:36.410 --> 00:37.978
Three days
till Christmas!

00:38.007 --> 00:40.242
Mr. S., I have to mail
my letter to Santa.

00:40.310 --> 00:43.145
I'm asking for an
authentic polar bear helmet

00:43.213 --> 00:44.780
from the movie
<i>Golden Compass.</i>

00:46.316 --> 00:48.050
You're a golden dumb-ass!

00:48.117 --> 00:49.785
Dad, be nice
to Jeff.

00:49.853 --> 00:51.553
He's just excited
about Christmas.

00:51.621 --> 00:54.323
He's a grown man and he still
believes in Santa Claus.

00:54.390 --> 00:55.724
Isn't it amazing?

00:55.792 --> 00:58.360
To maintain that
childlike sense of wonder?

00:58.428 --> 01:00.362
No, Hayley.
And I'm not getting that moron

01:00.430 --> 01:01.630
a damn thing for Christmas.

01:01.698 --> 01:02.865
Just because you married him

01:02.932 --> 01:04.433
doesn't make him
a part of my family.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.402
Actually, it does, Dad, and
you need to accept that.

01:07.470 --> 01:09.338
Hayley, the only thing
I have to accept is that

01:09.405 --> 01:11.139
socially I can't wear mascara

01:11.207 --> 01:14.142
even though it makes my eyes
pop like firecrackers.

01:16.346 --> 01:19.481
Look, I've got wooden clogs
to put around the tree.

01:19.549 --> 01:21.483
I'm starting a new
Christmas tradition.

01:21.551 --> 01:22.951
What was wrong with
our old traditions?

01:23.019 --> 01:24.853
Like letting homeless people
smell our napkins

01:24.921 --> 01:26.488
after Christmas dinner?

01:26.556 --> 01:29.491
On <i>The View,</i> they said
we could try the Dutch custom

01:29.559 --> 01:31.760
of putting presents
in wooden clogs.

01:31.828 --> 01:33.428
Barbara Walters said it,

01:33.496 --> 01:36.431
and she had an affair with
a married black senator.

01:36.499 --> 01:39.801
So, you know, she doesn't drive
in the slow lane.

01:39.869 --> 01:41.136
Well, I'm not gonna be able

01:41.204 --> 01:43.071
to fit my present
for Steve in a shoe.

01:43.139 --> 01:45.173
I'm getting him his first gun
this Christmas.

01:45.241 --> 01:47.009
It's the perfect way
for us to bond.

01:47.076 --> 01:48.243
A gun?

01:48.311 --> 01:50.279
Can't you bond over
something else?

01:50.346 --> 01:51.513
I've tried everything else--

01:51.581 --> 01:53.148
darts, a Ping-Pong table,
that puppy.

01:54.250 --> 01:55.550
The puppy!

01:55.618 --> 01:57.619
Eh, it's probably too late.

01:57.687 --> 02:01.123
Well, I'm sorry, but guns
are too dangerous for Steve.

02:01.190 --> 02:03.625
Promise you won't get
him one for Christmas.

02:03.693 --> 02:06.929
I promise I won't get Steve
a gun for Christmas.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.131
Merry Wednesday, son!

02:09.198 --> 02:10.666
A machine gun?

02:10.733 --> 02:13.001
Mm, seems a bit dangerous
for me.

02:13.069 --> 02:14.803
But I guess if coked-out
child soldiers

02:14.871 --> 02:16.171
in the Congo can do it...

02:16.239 --> 02:17.606
That's the spirit.

02:17.674 --> 02:19.675
Hey, Mr. S., I'll go
shooting with you guys, too.

02:20.743 --> 02:22.778
Jeff, I am trying to have

02:22.845 --> 02:24.780
a bonding experience
with my son.

02:24.847 --> 02:26.214
You are not my son.

02:26.282 --> 02:27.849
You are no part of this family.

02:27.917 --> 02:30.452
And when I open my eyes,
you better be gone, okay?

02:30.520 --> 02:32.454
I don't want to see
a trace of you.

02:35.758 --> 02:36.925
Terrible.

02:39.595 --> 02:40.712
Pardon me, sir.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.831
I'm what you might call
an advanced drinker,

02:42.899 --> 02:46.034
and I've been having a Dickens
of a time concocting an eggnog

02:46.102 --> 02:50.906
that provides the certain...
heady tingle that I require.

02:50.974 --> 02:53.541
Well, normally, people put
bourbon in their eggnog.

02:53.593 --> 02:56.011
I'm telling you,
I can't get drunk!

02:56.062 --> 02:57.429
My apologies, sir.

02:57.497 --> 02:59.748
I had to be sure
you were serious.

03:03.152 --> 03:05.220
There is
legend of a...

03:09.826 --> 03:12.160
There is legend of a
moonshiner who lives atop

03:12.228 --> 03:15.430
<i>the tallest peak</i>
<i>of the Chimdale Mountains.</i>

03:15.498 --> 03:19.434
<i>They say he's blind,</i>
<i>standing nine feet tall,</i>

03:19.502 --> 03:20.869
<i>with four arms and...</i>

03:20.937 --> 03:22.838
Excuse me, do you have
seasonal beers?

03:22.905 --> 03:26.141
You're killing his story!

03:26.209 --> 03:28.276
I can't
do anything right.

03:28.344 --> 03:31.797
Atop that mountain, a
four-armed nine-foot blind man,

03:31.881 --> 03:33.799
<i>who also has the tongue</i>
<i>of a dragon,</i>

03:33.883 --> 03:36.968
<i>makes the strongest whiskey</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

03:37.053 --> 03:39.521
<i>They say that if you're crazy,</i>
<i>it makes you sane.</i>

03:39.588 --> 03:40.972
<i>And if you're sane,</i>

03:41.057 --> 03:43.725
<i>you'll never believe</i>
<i>a word of this story.</i>

03:45.395 --> 03:47.279
I believe everything.

03:48.414 --> 03:49.898
Then take this map.

03:49.966 --> 03:51.616
It is my gift to you.

03:51.684 --> 03:53.101
But just know that...

03:53.169 --> 03:55.670
I'm all set with the beer,
but I've got a random question.

03:55.738 --> 03:58.040
Do you sell watch batteries?

04:03.679 --> 04:04.846
Get out.

04:06.449 --> 04:09.718
Steve, shooting a gun is like
being intimate with a woman.

04:09.786 --> 04:12.120
First, you inspect it
to make sure it's clean.

04:12.171 --> 04:14.623
Then you grab it on the butt
and jam the magazine in.

04:14.690 --> 04:17.559
If it doesn't fit, make it.

04:22.265 --> 04:24.850
Almost shot my eye out!

04:24.934 --> 04:26.868
Whoa, looks like
your mom was right.

04:26.936 --> 04:28.136
This isn't safe.

04:30.807 --> 04:33.108
Safety goggles.

04:33.176 --> 04:34.342
Ooh, new target!

04:34.410 --> 04:35.310
Snowman! Get him!

04:37.000 --> 04:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:47.757 --> 04:49.157
Oh, my God!

04:49.225 --> 04:50.559
A mall Santa!

04:50.626 --> 04:52.194
I-I didn't see him.

04:52.261 --> 04:53.395
Is he...?
Dead?

04:53.463 --> 04:54.830
Were you gonna ask
if he's dead?

04:54.897 --> 04:56.331
I was gonna ask
if he's okay.

04:56.399 --> 04:57.666
Oh, no. No, no, no.

04:57.733 --> 04:59.167
No, no. No.

04:59.235 --> 05:00.602
He-He is, he is dead.

05:00.670 --> 05:01.970
He is not okay.

05:02.038 --> 05:04.739
He will never be okay,
because he is-- say it with me--

05:04.807 --> 05:06.541
dead.

05:06.609 --> 05:07.943
You didn't say it with me.

05:09.199 --> 05:10.766
Why did you have
to give me a gun?

05:10.834 --> 05:12.601
I'll never pull another
trigger as long as I live!

05:13.539 --> 05:15.351
Relax, Steve.
Part of gun ownership

05:15.390 --> 05:16.757
is killing people by mistake.

05:16.824 --> 05:18.091
What the hell
do we do now?

05:18.159 --> 05:19.710
Well, we're gonna
keep things pretty simple.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.112
Check the guy's fingerprints
on my CIA computer,

05:22.180 --> 05:24.214
send an anonymous note
to his next of kin,

05:24.282 --> 05:26.049
and make sure your mother
doesn't find out.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.151
If she knew I gave you a gun,
she'd kill me.

05:28.219 --> 05:30.020
Or maybe she'd get you
to do it, huh, killer?

05:30.088 --> 05:31.288
No.

05:31.356 --> 05:34.691
No, I'm kidding,
but you-you have killed someone.

05:39.998 --> 05:41.631
Got to be
around here somewhere.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.904
Excuse me.

05:47.972 --> 05:51.241
Well, if it ain't
an alien in a wig.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.043
What you say is true, sir.

05:53.111 --> 05:55.746
And I seek a blind moonshiner
with four arms

05:55.813 --> 05:58.181
who makes the strongest whiskey
known to man.

05:58.249 --> 05:59.983
You found him, alien.

06:00.051 --> 06:01.885
But you only
have two arms.

06:01.953 --> 06:03.920
And it appears you can
see me quite well.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.288
Take a drop of this here.

06:05.356 --> 06:06.656
I call it shineapple.

06:06.724 --> 06:07.624
Just a touch!

06:10.228 --> 06:13.864
Do you believe me now?

06:13.931 --> 06:15.532
Oh, my God.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.767
It is you.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.168
The name's Bob Todd.

06:18.236 --> 06:20.037
Bob Todd Williams.

06:20.104 --> 06:22.105
Robert Todford Williams.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.607
Bobby Todd, if you like.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.675
Todd Willy's fine, too.

06:25.743 --> 06:28.111
Robert Todd and Bob Todford's
all the same.

06:28.179 --> 06:31.281
If you holler "Mr. Williams,"
I won't know what to do with it!

06:31.349 --> 06:33.850
I do however go by T-Dub
at the racetrack.

06:33.918 --> 06:36.586
And all the ladies,
well, they call me Bert-Bert.

06:36.654 --> 06:38.722
Bob Todd, my name is Roger.

06:38.790 --> 06:41.491
And it would be an honor if
I could purchase your whiskey.

06:41.559 --> 06:42.859
Purchase?

06:42.927 --> 06:44.494
I got no use
for your green money.

06:44.562 --> 06:46.496
What the hell am I
supposed to do with it?

06:46.564 --> 06:47.597
Go shopping in a store?

06:47.665 --> 06:48.899
Buy a record?

06:48.966 --> 06:51.068
Guess I'll have to go
a different route.

06:51.135 --> 06:52.803
Ain't no need
to prostrate yourself.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.539
You want some of this whiskey,
I'll teach you how to make it.

06:55.606 --> 06:57.207
Oh, my God,
thank you!

06:57.275 --> 06:59.976
Oh, boy, you had me in the
palm of your hand there.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.311
'Bout a second later,

07:01.379 --> 07:03.146
that would've been
the other way around.

07:06.284 --> 07:08.168
Okay, let's hide
this guy in the backyard

07:08.236 --> 07:09.603
while I run his prints.

07:09.687 --> 07:10.754
Damn it!

07:10.822 --> 07:12.856
Just be casual,
follow my lead.

07:12.924 --> 07:15.325
Hey, Francine,
you look amazing!

07:15.393 --> 07:16.660
You look amazing,
Francine.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.361
You're so
attractive.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.603
Strange.

07:26.671 --> 07:29.606
Our mall Santa's prints
aren't in the CIA's files.

07:29.674 --> 07:30.807
Uh-oh.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.480
Okay, here's what happened.

07:36.547 --> 07:37.814
I killed him!

07:37.882 --> 07:39.883
You were right, Mom,
I'm too young for a gun!

07:39.951 --> 07:41.551
A boy shot
a man today!

07:41.619 --> 07:43.787
A boy shot a man!

07:43.855 --> 07:45.455
Steve killed somebody?

07:45.523 --> 07:46.923
Have you called the police?

07:46.991 --> 07:48.458
No need to.
Me and Steve can handle it.

07:48.526 --> 07:50.093
Stan, you've done enough.

07:50.161 --> 07:52.229
I will not have
this Christmas ruined.

07:52.296 --> 07:54.998
Now, we're just gonna bury
that body deep in the woods

07:55.066 --> 07:57.434
and never talk about it again.

07:59.470 --> 08:01.738
We don't speak of this
to anyone.

08:04.509 --> 08:06.743
I can't believe we're burying
this guy in the woods.

08:06.794 --> 08:09.279
I can't believe you guys didn't
let me smash his teeth out

08:09.330 --> 08:11.781
and cut off his hands.

08:11.849 --> 08:14.684
What? You want to get away
with this or not?

08:16.220 --> 08:18.188
Okay, I'm gonna teach you
how to make

08:18.256 --> 08:20.624
this here whiskey
the way my pappy taught me.

08:20.691 --> 08:23.126
Just know that my methods
are unusual.

08:23.194 --> 08:26.263
I'm the opposite of them Jews
with the curlicue sideburns.

08:26.330 --> 08:28.532
What-What do they call
them-them sideburn Jews?

08:28.599 --> 08:29.482
Orthodox?

08:29.550 --> 08:32.052
Right. I am unorthodox.

08:32.119 --> 08:34.203
Now take you a full swig
and we'll get started.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.460
You did it!

08:57.528 --> 08:59.563
You kissed the raccoon.

08:59.630 --> 09:02.332
You're a real moonshiner now,
you son of a bitch.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.802
Go forth and brew my ancient
elixir with these sacred jugs.

09:05.853 --> 09:08.104
I look forward to the
day we meet again,

09:08.172 --> 09:09.506
you wise old cracker.

09:09.574 --> 09:11.308
You are always
welcome here, budro.

09:11.375 --> 09:12.375
You are my kin.

09:12.443 --> 09:14.110
And I will let you
drive my Camaro

09:14.178 --> 09:17.180
when I fix
the got-dang drive shaft.

09:20.918 --> 09:22.986
What the hell?

09:45.343 --> 09:46.743
Please tell me I'm not

09:46.811 --> 09:48.511
the only one who
got a crazy letter.

09:48.579 --> 09:49.896
I got one, too.

09:49.981 --> 09:52.515
Did someone blab about
what happened in the woods?

09:52.583 --> 09:53.650
No!
Uh-uh!

09:54.919 --> 09:55.752
Breaking news.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.020
It's the day before Christmas,

09:57.088 --> 09:58.321
and many people are saying

09:58.389 --> 09:59.689
it doesn't feel like
Christmas at all.

09:59.757 --> 10:01.057
Let's go to Terry Bates.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.193
Sir, if I asked what month
it felt like to you,

10:03.261 --> 10:04.294
what would you say?

10:04.362 --> 10:06.730
If I had to guess,
I'd say mid-October.

10:06.797 --> 10:08.131
And what is your profession?

10:08.199 --> 10:09.332
I make calendars.
