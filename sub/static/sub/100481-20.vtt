WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

STILL TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK

00:35.300 --> 00:36.366
VOID THAT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE

00:36.433 --> 00:37.866
THE INSIDE OF AN EGG, FROM THE

OFF-WHITE WALLS TO THE EERIE

"FACE MASK DROPLETS" AND THEN

00:50.100 --> 00:51.200
DOING IT AGAIN BUT WITH THE

IMPEL PEOPLE HERE TO TAKE THE

01:01.233 --> 01:02.000
VIRUS SERIOUSLY.

01:02.066 --> 01:02.733
YET STORIES KEEP CROPPING UP OF

01:02.800 --> 01:04.000
MASSIVE GATHERINGS, FROM AT

01:13.933 --> 01:15.200

01:15.266 --> 01:17.500
YES, IT'S SUMMER.

01:17.566 --> 01:19.033
YES, WE ALL WANT, AND IN MANY

01:19.100 --> 01:20.766
CASES, NEED, TO BLOW OFF SOME

01:20.833 --> 01:23.000
STEAM, BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR

01:23.066 --> 01:24.833
ANYONE TO BE VYING FOR INDUCTION

01:24.900 --> 01:26.333
INTO THE KNUCKLEHEAD HALL OF

01:26.400 --> 01:27.866
FAME.

01:27.933 --> 01:29.300

01:29.366 --> 01:30.733
RECORD, NEW JERSEY'S KNUCKLEHEAD

01:30.800 --> 01:31.800
HALL OF FAME IS BENNIES;

01:31.866 --> 01:32.800
THAT GABAGOOL FROM PHILLY WHO

01:32.866 --> 01:33.633
THOUGHT HE COULD PUMP HIS OWN

RALPH CIFARETTO; SLOW DRIVERS;

FAST DRIVERS; AND JARED KUSHNER.

01:41.033 --> 01:42.366
YEAH!

01:42.433 --> 01:43.700
JARED'S FROM JERSEY!

01:43.766 --> 01:45.033
I KNOW HE LOOKS LIKE HE JUST

01:45.100 --> 01:46.200
EMERGED FROM A VAT OF VASELINE

01:46.266 --> 01:47.300
FULLY FORMED AS A SHINY HAUNTED

01:47.366 --> 01:48.300
HATE MANNEQUIN, BUT HE'S

01:48.366 --> 01:50.366
ACTUALLY FROM THE GARDEN STATE.

01:50.433 --> 01:51.800
AND THAT WASN'T EVEN THE MOST

01:51.866 --> 01:52.900
IRRITATING RECENT MASS

01:52.966 --> 01:54.300
GATHERING.

01:54.366 --> 01:55.366

CONCERT IN THE HAMPTONS OVER THE

01:58.066 --> 01:59.733
WEEKEND, WITH FANS SEEMINGLY

01:59.800 --> 02:00.966
IGNORING ALL SOCIAL DISTANCING,

02:01.033 --> 02:02.233
HAS NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR UP IN

02:02.300 --> 02:03.866
ARMS.

02:03.933 --> 02:05.400
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:05.466 --> 02:06.433
IMAGINE RISKING YOUR LIFE TO SEE

02:06.500 --> 02:09.433
THE CHAINSMOKERS.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.900
ALTHOUGH IT AT LEAST ADDS A NEW

02:10.966 --> 02:12.000
DIMENSION TO THEIR LYRICS, NOW

02:12.066 --> 02:13.033
THAT "WE AIN'T EVER GETTING

02:13.100 --> 02:14.300
OLDER" COULD REASONABLY BE

02:14.366 --> 02:15.466
FOLLOWED BY "BECAUSE WE

02:15.533 --> 02:16.866
CONTRACTED A DEADLY VIRUS AT OUR

02:16.933 --> 02:19.366
STUPID CONCERT IN SOUTHAMPTON."

02:19.433 --> 02:20.733
AND TO BE FAIR, THE EVENT

02:20.800 --> 02:23.266
ORGANIZERS AND PERFORMERS SAY

02:23.333 --> 02:24.633
THAT THEY FOLLOWED ALL CDC AND

02:24.700 --> 02:25.666
STATE GUIDELINES.

02:25.733 --> 02:26.333
AND THEY CERTAINLY DID THEIR

02:26.400 --> 02:27.100
PART TO TRY AND DRIVE PEOPLE

02:27.166 --> 02:28.366
AWAY.

02:28.433 --> 02:30.133
>> THE CONCERT ALSO FEATURED A

02:30.200 --> 02:31.666
PERFORMANCE BY GOLDMAN SACHS CEO

02:31.733 --> 02:32.666
DAVID SOLOMON, WHO MOONLIGHTS AS

02:32.733 --> 02:34.200
A DJ.

02:34.266 --> 02:35.500
>> John: YES.

02:35.566 --> 02:36.633
HE DOES.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.633
HE APPARENTLY CALLS HIMSELF

02:38.700 --> 02:41.100
"DJ D-SOL," AND ON SPOTIFY, HE

02:41.166 --> 02:42.766
HAS NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT SEVEN

02:42.833 --> 02:44.400
REMIXES OF THE R&B CLASSIC

02:44.466 --> 02:46.000
"RESCUE ME," ALL OF WHICH ARE --

02:46.066 --> 02:47.300
AND I SAY THIS AS RESPECTFULLY

02:47.366 --> 02:49.566
AS POSSIBLE -- FUCKING GARBAGE.

02:49.633 --> 02:51.300
AND WHILE I PERSONALLY DON'T

02:51.366 --> 02:53.000
UNDERSTAND THE ATTRACTION IN

02:53.066 --> 02:54.266
WATCHING DJ BUSINESS

02:54.333 --> 02:57.900
BRUCE WILLIS HIT PLAY

02:57.966 --> 02:58.666
ON AN iPHONE, IT IS CLEAR,

02:58.733 --> 02:59.400
RECKLESSNESS IS ABOUNDING RIGHT

02:59.466 --> 03:00.600
NOW, HEIGHTENING THE NEED FOR

03:00.666 --> 03:02.333
STRONG LEADERSHIP.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.566
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE GETTING

03:03.633 --> 03:05.000
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT.

03:05.066 --> 03:06.200
JUST A WEEK AFTER TRUMP WAS

03:06.266 --> 03:07.300
GIVEN CREDIT FOR "SHIFTING HIS

03:07.366 --> 03:08.666
RHETORIC" BY URGING AMERICANS TO

03:08.733 --> 03:10.000
WEAR MASKS, HE DID SOMETHING

03:10.066 --> 03:11.500
THAT, EVEN FOR HIM, WAS

03:11.566 --> 03:13.833
SHOCKINGLY RECKLESS.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.366
>> THE PRESIDENT AGAIN USED HIS

03:15.433 --> 03:16.900
TWITTER ACCOUNT TO SPREAD

03:16.966 --> 03:18.300
MISINFORMATION, TWEETING VIDEO

03:18.366 --> 03:19.933
OF A DOCTOR DENOUNCING THE USE

03:20.000 --> 03:21.533
OF MASKS AND PROMOTING

03:21.600 --> 03:22.733
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.933
THAT DOCTOR, WHO WAS ONLY

03:24.000 --> 03:25.100
LICENSED TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN

03:25.166 --> 03:26.966
TEXAS LAST NOVEMBER, HAS A

03:27.033 --> 03:28.600
HISTORY OF OUTRAGEOUS

03:28.666 --> 03:30.000
STATEMENTS, SUCH AS SAYING

03:30.066 --> 03:31.400
HEALTH PROBLEMS CAN BE CAUSED BY

03:31.466 --> 03:32.800
DEMONS.

03:32.866 --> 03:34.200
>> John: YEAH!

03:34.266 --> 03:35.300
THAT'S PRETTY UPSETTING COMING

03:35.366 --> 03:36.500
FROM A DOCTOR.

03:36.566 --> 03:37.766
YOU'D EXPECT THAT BULLSHIT FROM

03:37.833 --> 03:38.800
SOME IDIOT WHO CLAIMS TO KNOW

03:38.866 --> 03:40.300
ABOUT MEDICINE BUT DOESN'T HAVE

03:40.366 --> 03:42.933
A MEDICAL LICENSE, LIKE YOUR

03:43.000 --> 03:45.033
DIPSHIT UNCLE OR DR. PHIL.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.200
BUT FROM A LICENSED MEDICAL

03:48.266 --> 03:48.866
PROFESSIONAL, THAT IS WILDLY

03:48.933 --> 03:49.766
IRRESPONSIBLE.

03:49.833 --> 03:50.600
SHE'S ALSO REPORTEDLY CLAIMED

03:50.666 --> 03:51.800
THAT ALIEN DNA IS BEING USED IN

03:51.866 --> 03:52.900
MEDICAL TREATMENTS, THE

03:52.966 --> 03:54.433
GOVERNMENT IS RUN BY REPTILIANS,

03:54.500 --> 03:55.533
AND THAT SCIENTISTS ARE COOKING

03:55.600 --> 03:56.866
UP A VACCINE TO PREVENT PEOPLE

03:56.933 --> 03:58.700
FROM BECOMING RELIGIOUS.

03:58.766 --> 03:59.533
WHICH, LOOK, WE ALREADY HAVE

03:59.600 --> 04:00.700
THAT LAST ONE.

04:00.766 --> 04:01.666
IT'S CALLED "KIRK CAMERON'S

04:01.733 --> 04:04.600
SAVING CHRISTMAS."

04:04.666 --> 04:06.166
POP THAT DVD IN AND 79 MINUTES

04:06.233 --> 04:07.566
LATER YOU'LL BE CONVINCED NO GOD

04:07.633 --> 04:09.033
WOULD LET THIS HAPPEN.

04:09.100 --> 04:13.933
AND WHEN HER COMMENTS WERE

04:14.000 --> 04:15.033
POINTED OUT TO THE PRESIDENT, HE

04:15.100 --> 04:18.733
REFUSED TO BACK DOWN.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.366
>> SHE WAS ON AIR ALONG WITH

04:19.433 --> 04:19.966
MANY OTHER DOCTORS.

04:20.033 --> 04:20.833
THEY WERE BIG FANS OF

04:20.900 --> 04:21.633
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, AND I

04:21.700 --> 04:22.400
THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE

04:22.466 --> 04:24.966
IN THE SENSE THAT, FROM WHERE

04:25.033 --> 04:25.966
SHE CAME --

04:26.033 --> 04:27.066
I DON'T KNOW WHICH COUNTRY

04:27.133 --> 04:27.700
SHE COMES FROM, BUT SHE SAID

04:27.766 --> 04:28.466
THAT SHE'S HAD TREMENDOUS

04:28.533 --> 04:29.666
SUCCESS WITH HUNDREDS OF

04:29.733 --> 04:30.533
DIFFERENT PATIENTS.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.533
AND I THOUGHT HER VOICE WAS AN

04:31.600 --> 04:32.500
IMPORTANT VOICE, BUT I KNOW

04:32.566 --> 04:33.466
NOTHING ABOUT HER.

04:33.533 --> 04:34.766
>> John: WOW.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.000
HE THINKS HER VOICE IS IMPORTANT

04:36.066 --> 04:37.100
BUT ADMITS TO KNOWING NOTHING

04:37.166 --> 04:39.966
ELSE ABOUT HER.

04:40.033 --> 04:40.633
THAT IS NOT THE PHILOSOPHY YOU

04:40.700 --> 04:42.066
WANT WHEN VETTING MEDICAL

04:42.133 --> 04:42.500
EXPERTS.

04:42.566 --> 04:43.700
IT'S BARELY A PHILOSOPHY YOU

04:43.766 --> 04:45.266
WANT ON "THE VOICE."

04:45.333 --> 04:46.400
SURE, THE JUDGES START BY

04:46.466 --> 04:47.500
KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT THE

04:47.566 --> 04:48.500
CONTESTANTS BESIDES THEIR VOICE,

04:48.566 --> 04:49.533
BUT ONCE THEIR INTERESTS ARE

04:49.600 --> 04:51.066
PIQUED, THEY KNOW TO TURN THE

04:51.133 --> 04:53.666
FUCK AROUND TO INVESTIGATE.

04:53.733 --> 04:54.566
AND DOWNPLAYING THE RISKS OF

04:54.633 --> 04:57.266
THIS CAN HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES.

04:57.333 --> 05:01.500
ON THURSDAY, HERMAN CAIN DIED,

05:01.566 --> 05:03.066
ABOUT SIX WEEKS AFTER ATTENDING

05:03.133 --> 05:03.833
A TRUMP RALLY IN TULSA WHERE HE

05:03.900 --> 05:04.466
WAS PHOTOGRAPHED WITHOUT A MASK,

05:04.533 --> 05:05.333
LATER TWEETING THAT "PEOPLE ARE

05:05.400 --> 05:06.233
FED UP" OF BEING MADE TO WEAR

05:06.300 --> 05:07.300
THEM.

05:07.366 --> 05:09.200
AND THIS, SADLY, WON'T BE THE

05:09.266 --> 05:10.366
LAST TIME WE SEE PEOPLE FIND OUT

05:10.433 --> 05:11.066
THE HARD WAY HOW SERIOUS THIS

05:11.133 --> 05:12.300
IS.

05:12.366 --> 05:13.333
BECAUSE ON WEDNESDAY, YET

05:13.400 --> 05:14.366
ANOTHER MEMBER OF CONGRESS

05:14.433 --> 05:15.800
TESTED POSITIVE.

05:15.866 --> 05:17.200
>> TEXAS CONGRESSMAN

05:17.266 --> 05:18.366
LOUIE GOHMERT, SPOTTED ON

05:18.433 --> 05:20.366
CAPITOL HILL JUST YESTERDAY

05:20.433 --> 05:21.733
MASKLESS, WALKING NEAR

05:21.800 --> 05:22.966
ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BARR,

05:23.033 --> 05:24.333
GETTING HIS DIAGNOSIS AT THE

05:24.400 --> 05:26.333
WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.466
BUT GOHMERT DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY

05:27.533 --> 05:29.066
ISOLATE HIMSELF.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.633
INSTEAD HE RETURNED TO HIS

05:30.700 --> 05:32.733
CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE TO TELL HIS

05:32.800 --> 05:38.033
STAFF IN PERSON.

05:38.100 --> 05:38.600
>> John: WHAT?

05:38.666 --> 05:39.533
IF THAT'S TRUE, IT'S ABSURD.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.366
BECAUSE "I'M CARRYING A HIGHLY

05:40.433 --> 05:41.266
INFECTIOUS DISEASE" IS NEVER

05:41.333 --> 05:42.400
NEWS THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD IN

05:42.466 --> 05:43.700
PERSON, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE

05:43.766 --> 05:45.133
ARE PLENTY OF BETTER WAYS TO DO

05:45.200 --> 05:46.666
IT.

05:46.733 --> 05:48.366
YOU COULD HIRE A SKYWRITER TO

05:48.433 --> 05:49.466
WRITE "I'M POSI FOR CORONA."

05:49.533 --> 05:50.500
YOU COULD MAKE A CUSTOM

05:50.566 --> 05:52.133
CROSSWORD PUZZLE THAT SPELLS OUT

05:52.200 --> 05:53.766
"YOUR BOSS HAS THE CORONA."

05:53.833 --> 05:54.900
YOU COULD GO ON CAMEO AND GET

05:54.966 --> 05:55.933
STEVE GUTTENBERG TO RECORD A

05:56.000 --> 05:59.866
MESSAGE FOR THEM.

05:59.933 --> 06:00.966
SERIOUSLY, HE'LL DO IT.

06:01.033 --> 06:01.633
LOOK.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.166
>> HEY, QUICK MESSAGE FOR

06:04.233 --> 06:05.300
LOUIE GOHMERT'S STAFF:

06:05.366 --> 06:05.966
YOUR BOSS HAS THE 'RONA.

06:06.033 --> 06:06.900
OBVIOUSLY HE'D HAVE TO BE A

06:06.966 --> 06:07.733
COMPLETE IDIOT TO TELL YOU THAT

06:07.800 --> 06:08.433
IN PERSON, SO HE GOT ME,

06:08.500 --> 06:09.266
STEVE GUTTENBERG, TO TELL YOU

06:09.333 --> 06:18.133
INSTEAD.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.433
>> STAY 6 FEET AWAY OR MORE FROM

06:21.500 --> 06:22.800
HIM AND WEAR A MASK.

06:22.866 --> 06:23.733
I WAS IN "POLICE ACADEMY"!

06:23.800 --> 06:24.700
BYE!

06:24.766 --> 06:26.000
>> John: BEST $150 I EVER SPENT.

06:26.066 --> 06:26.733
NOW, GOHMERT INSISTS HE NOTIFIED

06:26.800 --> 06:27.966
HIS STAFF BY PHONE, AND ONLY

06:28.033 --> 06:29.066
THEN DID HE VISIT HIS OFFICE,

06:29.133 --> 06:30.233
WEARING A MASK.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.933
BUT SHOWING UP IN PERSON AT ALL

06:32.000 --> 06:35.766
IS STILL THE LEVEL OF

06:35.833 --> 06:37.066
CLUELESSNESS YOU'D KIND OF

06:37.133 --> 06:38.266
EXPECT FROM A GUY WHO ALWAYS

06:38.333 --> 06:39.400
LOOKS LIKE HE HASN'T YET

06:39.466 --> 06:40.233
REALIZED HIS TOUPEE BLEW OFF.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.200
AND THIS IS REPORTEDLY JUST THE

06:41.266 --> 06:42.166
BEGINNING OF HIS STAFF'S

06:42.233 --> 06:43.100
PROBLEMS WITH HIM.

06:43.166 --> 06:44.700
>> THIS IS A LETTER FROM AN AIDE

06:44.766 --> 06:45.700
TO LOUIE GOHMERT, POLITICO SAYS.

06:45.766 --> 06:46.700
"THANK YOU FOR LETTING OUR

06:46.766 --> 06:47.733
OFFICE KNOW LOUIE TESTED

06:47.800 --> 06:49.066
POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS."

06:49.133 --> 06:50.066
"WHEN YOU WRITE YOUR STORY, CAN

06:50.133 --> 06:51.500
YOU INCLUDE THE FACT THAT LOUIE

06:51.566 --> 06:52.700
REQUIRES FULL STAFF TO BE IN THE

06:52.766 --> 06:54.366
OFFICE, INCLUDING THREE INTERNS,

06:54.433 --> 06:55.966
SO THAT WE CAN BE AN EXAMPLE TO

06:56.033 --> 06:57.266
AMERICA ON HOW TO OPEN UP

06:57.333 --> 06:58.533
SAFELY.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.733
WHEN PROBING THE OFFICE, YOU

06:59.800 --> 07:01.733
MIGHT WANT TO ASK HOW OFTEN WERE

07:01.800 --> 07:03.466
PEOPLE BERATED FOR WEARING

07:03.533 --> 07:05.566
MASKS."

07:05.633 --> 07:07.166
>> John: WOW.

07:07.233 --> 07:08.433
AND WHILE GOHMERT DISPUTES THAT

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
CLAIM TOO, IT GOES WITHOUT

07:09.566 --> 07:10.766
SAYING, NOBODY SHOULD BE BERATED

07:10.833 --> 07:11.900
FOR WEARING A MASK.

07:11.966 --> 07:13.233
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT'S HANGING

07:13.300 --> 07:14.333
BELOW THEIR CHIN, WHICH IS A BIT

07:14.400 --> 07:15.866
LIKE PUTTING A DIAPER AROUND A

07:15.933 --> 07:17.000
BABY'S ANKLES.

07:17.066 --> 07:18.466
YOU CLEARLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND

07:18.533 --> 07:20.300
HOW BUTTS WORK.

07:20.366 --> 07:21.700
AND LOOK, THIS RECKLESS

07:21.766 --> 07:22.633
INDIFFERENCE -- WHETHER IT'S

07:22.700 --> 07:24.400
COMING FROM THESE IDIOTS, THIS

07:24.466 --> 07:25.600
IDIOT, THAT IDIOT, THIS

07:25.666 --> 07:28.066
ESPECIALLY IDIOTIC IDIOT,

07:28.133 --> 07:29.266
OR THE MOST POWERFUL IDIOT

07:29.333 --> 07:30.133
OF ALL -- IS COSTING PEOPLE

07:30.200 --> 07:31.733
THEIR LIVES.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.900
AND IT'S PAST TIME THAT WE START

07:32.966 --> 07:33.966
PROTECTING EACH OTHER AND TAKING

07:34.033 --> 07:35.500
THIS SERIOUSLY.

07:35.566 --> 07:37.600
BECAUSE THANKS TO THESE GUYS,

07:37.666 --> 07:39.000
THE KNUCKLEHEAD HALL OF FAME IS

07:39.066 --> 07:41.400
GETTING PRETTY FUCKING CROWDED.

07:41.466 --> 07:45.966
AND NOW THIS.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.833
>> Announce>> Announcer: AND NON

08:17.933 --> 08:21.333

08:21.400 --> 08:28.066
THANKS, STEVE.

08:28.133 --> 08:28.633
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.300
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:29.366 --> 08:30.166
HISTORY, A SUBJECT SO

08:30.233 --> 08:30.733
FASCINATING, WE'RE SOMETIMES

08:30.800 --> 08:31.366
WILLING TO DO CRAZY EXPERIMENTS

08:31.433 --> 08:31.733
LIKE THIS:

08:31.800 --> 08:32.733
>> SCIENTISTS WERE ABLE TO MIMIC

08:32.800 --> 08:33.333
NESYAMUN'S VOICE BY RECREATING

08:33.400 --> 08:33.966
HIS MOUTH AND VOCAL CORDS WITH A

08:34.033 --> 08:34.500
3D PRINTER.

08:34.566 --> 08:35.333
IT ALLOWED THEM TO PRODUCE A

08:35.400 --> 08:36.100
SINGLE SOUND.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.433
>> EH.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.833
EH.

08:38.900 --> 08:39.766
EH.

08:39.833 --> 08:40.966
>> John: EXCELLENT.

08:41.033 --> 08:43.766
FINALLY AN ANSWER TO THE

08:43.833 --> 08:45.066
QUESTION THAT SCHOLARS HAVE

08:45.133 --> 08:45.900
ASKED FOR AGES: WHAT WOULD AN

08:45.966 --> 08:46.633
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SOUND LIKE IF

08:46.700 --> 08:47.933
HE ORGASMED WHILE TAKING

08:48.000 --> 08:50.833
ANTIDEPRESSANTS?

08:50.900 --> 08:52.066
BUT LOOK, SADLY, HISTORY ISN'T

08:52.133 --> 08:52.566
ALWAYS FUN, WEIRD MUMMY

08:52.633 --> 08:53.233
VENTRILOQUY.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.366
IT CAN BE PAINFUL TOO, AS

08:56.433 --> 08:57.233
AMERICA HAS RECENTLY BEEN

08:57.300 --> 08:58.366
REMINDED, BECAUSE GEORGE FLOYD'S

08:58.433 --> 08:59.633
MURDER HAS FORCED A HARD

08:59.700 --> 09:01.133
NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS

09:01.200 --> 09:03.033
COUNTRY'S PRESENT, WHICH IS

09:03.100 --> 09:04.766
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO EFFECTIVELY

09:04.833 --> 09:05.966
WITHOUT RE-EXAMINING ITS PAST.

09:06.033 --> 09:06.933
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT A

09:07.000 --> 09:08.233
CONVERSATION THAT ALL AMERICANS

09:08.300 --> 09:09.400
ARE WELL-EQUIPPED TO HAVE,

09:09.466 --> 09:10.366
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME

09:10.433 --> 09:11.233
EMBARRASSING GAPS IN MANY

09:11.300 --> 09:11.966
PEOPLE'S KNOWLEDGE OF U.S.

09:12.033 --> 09:13.000
HISTORY.

09:13.066 --> 09:13.933
JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED A FEW

09:14.000 --> 09:15.566
WEEKS BACK, WHEN THE PRESIDENT,

09:15.633 --> 09:16.800
IN THE MIDST OF NATIONWIDE

09:16.866 --> 09:18.666
BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS,

09:18.733 --> 09:20.200
ANNOUNCED PLANS TO HOLD A RALLY

09:20.266 --> 09:22.500
IN TULSA ON JUNE 19TH, A

09:22.566 --> 09:23.633
DECISION ASTONISHINGLY TONE-DEAF

09:23.700 --> 09:25.866
FOR TWO KEY REASONS.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.666
>> NEXT FRIDAY, JUNE 19TH, IS

09:27.733 --> 09:29.066
JUNETEENTH, AN ANNUAL HOLIDAY

09:29.133 --> 09:30.300
COMMEMORATING THE END OF SLAVERY

09:30.366 --> 09:32.266
IN THE U.S.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.100
AS FOR TULSA, 99 YEARS AGO THIS

09:34.166 --> 09:36.933
MONTH IN 1921, THE CITY

09:37.000 --> 09:37.900
WITNESSED THE TULSA RACE

09:37.966 --> 09:39.533
MASSACRE, ONE OF THE NATION'S

09:39.600 --> 09:40.700
WORST OUTBREAKS OF RACIAL

09:40.766 --> 09:42.900
VIOLENCE, RECENTLY PORTRAYED IN

09:42.966 --> 09:46.733
HBO'S "WATCHMEN."

09:46.800 --> 09:47.866
>> John: NOW, THE REASON THEY'RE

09:47.933 --> 09:49.733
MENTIONING "WATCHMEN" THERE IS,

09:49.800 --> 09:50.900
A LOT OF AMERICANS LEARNED ABOUT

09:50.966 --> 09:52.466
THE TULSA RACE MASSACRE FOR THE

09:52.533 --> 09:53.733
VERY FIRST TIME, NEARLY A

09:53.800 --> 09:54.866
CENTURY AFTER IT HAPPENED, FROM

09:54.933 --> 09:56.233
WATCHING THAT SHOW.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.333
BASICALLY, THE NIGHT THAT

09:57.400 --> 09:59.600
EPISODE AIRED, MANY WHITE

09:59.666 --> 10:01.333
AMERICANS WENT, "HOLY SHIT!

10:01.400 --> 10:02.400
I HAD NO IDEA THIS HAPPENED!"

10:02.466 --> 10:03.466
WHILE MANY BLACK AMERICANS WENT,

10:03.533 --> 10:04.833
"HOLY SHIT!

10:04.900 --> 10:07.700
WHITE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FREAK

10:07.766 --> 10:09.100
THE FUCK OUT WHEN THEY FIND OUT

10:09.166 --> 10:09.633
THIS HAPPENED!

10:09.700 --> 10:10.500
DEBBIE AT WORK IS GOING TO WANT

10:10.566 --> 10:11.633
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION."

10:11.700 --> 10:12.866
THE COVERAGE OF THAT TRUMP RALLY

10:12.933 --> 10:14.300
DIDN'T JUST INTRODUCE MANY

10:14.366 --> 10:15.066
AMERICANS TO THAT MASSACRE, BUT

10:15.133 --> 10:17.233
ALSO TO THE VERY CONCEPT OF

10:17.300 --> 10:23.200
JUNETEENTH, THE DAY THAT

10:23.266 --> 10:24.400
COMMEMORATES WHEN UNION TROOPS

10:24.466 --> 10:25.766
INFORMED TEXAS THAT ENSLAVED

10:25.833 --> 10:27.833
PEOPLE THAT MUST FINALLY BE

10:27.900 --> 10:28.333
FREED,

10:28.400 --> 10:29.766
TWO YEARS AFTER SLAVERY HAD BEEN

10:29.833 --> 10:30.300
ABOLISHED, BY THE WAY.

10:30.366 --> 10:31.200
A RECENT POLL SHOWED A SHOCKING

10:31.266 --> 10:31.966
48% OF AMERICANS WERE EITHER

10:32.033 --> 10:33.300
"NOT AT ALL" OR "NOT VERY AWARE"

10:33.366 --> 10:34.233
OF JUNETEENTH.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.866
WHICH IS NOT GOOD.

10:36.933 --> 10:38.133
I MEAN, IT'D BE FINE IF NEARLY

10:38.200 --> 10:39.433
HALF OF AMERICANS WERE UNAWARE

10:39.500 --> 10:40.833
OF GROUNDHOG DAY, THE

10:40.900 --> 10:42.233
MEANINGLESS DATE WHEN AN IDIOT

10:42.300 --> 10:43.600
DRESSED LIKE GOTH WILLY WONKA

10:43.666 --> 10:44.133
HOLDS UP A NON-CLAIRVOYANT

10:44.200 --> 10:44.933
WOODCHUCK WHOSE

10:45.000 --> 10:45.900
FACE SOMEHOW SCREAMS

10:45.966 --> 10:47.333
"I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO."

10:47.400 --> 10:49.166
BUT JUNETEENTH ACTUALLY MEANS

10:49.233 --> 10:51.100
SOMETHING.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.033
AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF MANY GAPS

10:52.100 --> 10:53.100
IN KNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE NOW

10:53.166 --> 10:55.466
REALIZING THEY HAVE.

10:55.533 --> 10:56.733
JUST WATCH JOY BEHAR TRY TO

10:56.800 --> 10:57.833
EXPLAIN WHY STATUES OF

10:57.900 --> 10:58.933
GEORGE WASHINGTON SHOULD BE LEFT

10:59.000 --> 11:00.500
ALONE, AND IN DOING SO, ACTUALLY

11:00.566 --> 11:01.700
LEARNING SOMETHING.

11:01.766 --> 11:03.733
>> BUT GEORGE WASHINGTON,

11:03.800 --> 11:05.100
BESIDES BEING A FOUNDING FATHER

11:05.166 --> 11:06.900
AND A GREAT GENERAL AND SOMEBODY

11:06.966 --> 11:08.733
WHO WAS SO INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS

11:08.800 --> 11:10.033
UNION THAT WE HAVE, IN THIS

11:10.100 --> 11:12.666
REPUBLIC, ALSO FREED HIS SLAVES.

11:12.733 --> 11:14.166
SO IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE SOMEBODY

11:14.233 --> 11:14.566
DOWN, TAKE DOWN --

11:14.633 --> 11:15.400
>> MMM.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.666
>> THOMAS JEFFERSON, WHO

11:16.733 --> 11:17.633
DIDN'T -- WHO DIDN'T FREE HIS

11:17.700 --> 11:18.100
SLAVES.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.166
NO?

11:19.233 --> 11:20.266
SUNNY DISAGREES.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.800
>> HE DIDN'T FREE HIS SLAVES.

11:22.866 --> 11:23.633
>> HE DIDN'T.

11:23.700 --> 11:24.466
>> HE ACTUALLY SPENT THE LAST

11:24.533 --> 11:25.066
YEAR OF HIS LIFE --

11:25.133 --> 11:25.900
>> OH.

11:25.966 --> 11:27.233
>> RET -- LIKE, RELENTLESSLY

11:27.300 --> 11:29.566
PURSUING SLAVES THAT TRIED TO

11:29.633 --> 11:32.400
RUN AWAY.

11:32.466 --> 11:35.033
HE WAS A HORRIBLE SLAVE OWNER.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.400
>> John: YEAH, HE WAS.

11:36.466 --> 11:37.966
AS USUAL, SUNNY HOSTIN IS VERY

11:38.033 --> 11:39.766
RIGHT, AND MEGHAN McCAIN IS

11:39.833 --> 11:43.966
VERY "THERE."

11:44.033 --> 11:44.966
BECAUSE, WHILE WASHINGTON DID

11:45.033 --> 11:45.733
PROMISE TO FREE HIS SLAVES IN

11:45.800 --> 11:46.533
HIS WILL, IT SPECIFIED THEY

11:46.600 --> 11:47.266
WOULDN'T GAIN THEIR FREEDOM

11:47.333 --> 11:48.266
UNTIL HIS WIFE'S DEATH.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.333
SO ONLY ONE PERSON WAS FREED

11:49.400 --> 11:50.300
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WASHINGTON

11:50.366 --> 11:52.533
DIED OUT OF OVER A HUNDRED.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.300
ALSO, HE ACTUALLY BECAME A SLAVE

11:54.366 --> 11:56.200
OWNER AT JUST 11 YEARS OLD --

11:56.266 --> 11:58.233
A FACT SO HORRIFYING, IT'S HARD

11:58.300 --> 11:59.833
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.200
AT THE VERY LEAST, THE STORY OF

12:01.266 --> 12:02.400
HIM CHOPPING DOWN A CHERRY TREE

12:02.466 --> 12:04.066
AS A CHILD AND ADMITTING IT TO

12:04.133 --> 12:07.233
HIS FATHER BY SAYING "I CANNOT

12:07.300 --> 12:08.466
TELL A LIE" GETS WAY LESS

12:08.533 --> 12:09.266
CHARMING IF THE NEXT PART IS HIS

12:09.333 --> 12:11.233
PARENTS SAYING, "THANK YOU FOR

12:11.300 --> 12:11.700
BEING HONEST, GEORGE.

12:11.766 --> 12:13.966
AS A REWARD, HERE ARE SOME HUMAN

12:14.033 --> 12:15.133
BEINGS TO OWN."

12:15.200 --> 12:16.933
AND THE THING IS, JOY BEHAR'S

12:17.000 --> 12:24.033
VERSION OF HISTORY, WHILE NOT

12:24.100 --> 12:24.600
ACCURATE, IS DEFINITELY MORE

12:24.666 --> 12:25.266
PALATABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR WHITE

12:25.333 --> 12:25.966
PEOPLE, AND SEEKING OUT

12:26.033 --> 12:26.733
MISLEADINGLY COMFORTING VERSIONS

12:26.800 --> 12:27.866
OF HISTORY IS A PATTERN WE'VE

12:27.933 --> 12:29.266
SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS YEAR.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.366
FROM THE NUMBER-ONE MOVIE ON

12:30.433 --> 12:31.100
NETFLIX DURING THE PROTESTS

12:31.166 --> 12:32.066
FOLLOWING GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER

12:32.133 --> 12:33.066
BEING "THE HELP" TO JUST LAST

12:33.133 --> 12:35.066
WEEK, WHEN SENATOR TOM COTTON

12:35.133 --> 12:36.933
SAID SCHOOLS SHOULD LOSE FEDERAL

12:37.000 --> 12:37.700
FUNDING IF THEY TEACH A

12:37.766 --> 12:38.233
CURRICULUM BASED ON

12:38.300 --> 12:39.533
"THE NEW YORK TIMES'"

12:39.600 --> 12:41.066
1619 PROJECT, WHICH BRINGS

12:41.133 --> 12:43.233
SLAVERY INTO THE FOREFRONT OF

12:43.300 --> 12:44.200
AMERICAN HISTORY.

12:44.266 --> 12:45.966
AND PERHAPS THE MOST ABSURD

12:46.033 --> 12:47.000
DISCONNECT WAS, IN THE WAKE OF

12:47.066 --> 12:52.500
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT A

12:52.566 --> 12:58.566
-- EULOGY FOR

12:58.633 --> 12:59.300
JOHN LEWIS THIS WEEK, IN

12:59.366 --> 12:59.933
WHICH OBAMA ADVOCATED FOR

13:00.000 --> 13:00.600
ABOLISHING THE FILIBUSTER TO

13:00.666 --> 13:01.266
PROTECT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT,

13:01.333 --> 13:02.000
TUCKER CARLSON HAD THIS TO SAY:

13:02.066 --> 13:02.666
>> IMAGINE IF SOME GREASY

13:02.733 --> 13:03.300
POLITICIAN SHOWED UP AT YOUR

13:03.366 --> 13:04.066
LOVED ONE'S FUNERAL AND STARTED

13:04.133 --> 13:05.133
THROWING AROUND STUPID PARTISAN

13:05.200 --> 13:05.966
TALKING POINTS ABOUT SENATE

13:06.033 --> 13:08.166
PROCEDURE.

13:08.233 --> 13:13.333
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?

13:13.400 --> 13:13.966
YOU WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THAT

13:14.033 --> 13:14.400
HAPPENED.

13:14.466 --> 13:15.133
YOU WOULD PROBABLY WALK OUT.

13:15.200 --> 13:15.666
DESECRATING A FUNERAL WITH

13:15.733 --> 13:16.633
CAMPAIGN SLOGANS, WHAT KIND OF

13:16.700 --> 13:19.233
PERSON WOULD DO THAT?

13:19.300 --> 13:22.233
>> John: WEIGHT.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.000
WHAT KIND OF PERSON

13:23.533 --> 13:25.033
WOULD HONOR A FRIEND'S LEGACY BY

13:25.100 --> 13:25.800
CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE FOR

13:25.866 --> 13:26.433
VOTING RIGHTS?

13:26.500 --> 13:27.266
I CAN THINK OF ONE.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.266
JOHN FUCKING LEWIS WOULD DO

13:28.333 --> 13:29.200
THAT.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.133
AND THE TRUTH IS, WITH SO MANY

13:30.200 --> 13:31.066
PEOPLE MISUNDERSTANDING OUR

13:31.133 --> 13:32.366
HISTORY, EITHER BY ACCIDENT OR

13:32.433 --> 13:33.200
VERY MUCH ON PURPOSE, WE THOUGHT

13:33.266 --> 13:35.400
TONIGHT IT MIGHT BE WORTH

13:35.466 --> 13:36.166
TALKING ABOUT HOW THE HISTORY OF

13:36.233 --> 13:39.600
RACE IN AMERICA IS CURRENTLY

13:39.666 --> 13:40.966
TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS -- WHAT THE

13:41.033 --> 13:41.966
GAPS ARE, WHY THEY'RE THERE, AND

13:42.033 --> 13:42.533
HOW WE CAN FILL THEM.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.400
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

13:43.466 --> 13:44.900
THAT THERE ARE NO NATIONAL

13:44.966 --> 13:46.500
STANDARDS FOR WHAT TOPICS OR

13:46.566 --> 13:47.966
FIGURES STUDENTS MUST LEARN

13:48.033 --> 13:48.766
ABOUT AT SCHOOL.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.633
AND STATE STANDARDS VARY WIDELY.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.066
WHEN CBS LOOKED INTO IT THIS

13:52.133 --> 13:53.466
YEAR, IT FOUND "SEVEN STATES DO

13:53.533 --> 13:55.066
NOT DIRECTLY MENTION SLAVERY IN

13:55.133 --> 13:58.266
THEIR STATE STANDARDS," ONLY TWO

13:58.333 --> 13:59.566
MENTION WHITE SUPREMACY, WHILE

13:59.633 --> 14:01.266
16 LIST STATES' RIGHTS AS A

14:01.333 --> 14:03.633
CAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.266
AND WE ACTUALLY DID A WHOLE

14:05.333 --> 14:07.866
21-MINUTE PIECE ABOUT WHAT'S

14:07.933 --> 14:08.633
WRONG WITH THAT ARGUMENT, BUT

14:08.700 --> 14:09.500
THIS CLIP EXPLAINS IT

14:09.566 --> 14:10.566
SIGNIFICANTLY QUICKER.

14:10.633 --> 14:12.000
>> THE ROOT OF THE CIVIL WAR IS

14:12.066 --> 14:12.500
CLEAR.

14:12.566 --> 14:13.133
>> WHAT CAUSED THE CIVIL WAR

14:13.200 --> 14:13.966
WAS --

14:14.033 --> 14:14.600
>> SLAVERY.

14:14.666 --> 14:15.333
>> THE MAIN CAUSE AND WHY THE

14:15.400 --> 14:17.066
SOUTH DECIDED TO SECEDE WAS --

14:17.133 --> 14:18.733
>> SLAVERY.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.566
>> SO, WHY DO OUR HISTORY

14:21.633 --> 14:24.266
TEXTBOOKS GET IT SO WRONG?

14:24.333 --> 14:25.166
>> Y'ALL DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH

14:25.233 --> 14:25.800
THE [BLEEP] UP [BLEEP] THAT

14:25.866 --> 14:26.333
Y'ALL ANCESTORS DID.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.333
>> John: YEAH, THAT PRETTY MUCH

14:27.400 --> 14:28.500
SUMS IT UP.

14:28.566 --> 14:30.433
IT CAN BE HARD TO DEAL WITH WHAT

14:30.500 --> 14:31.866
YOUR ANCESTORS DID -- TRUST ME,

14:31.933 --> 14:34.366
I'M BRITISH.

14:34.433 --> 14:36.366
ONE OF OUR MOST FAMOUS TOURIST

14:36.433 --> 14:38.266
ATTRACTIONS IS A CASTLE WHERE WE

14:38.333 --> 14:39.700
EXECUTED PEOPLE FOR CENTURIES

14:39.766 --> 14:40.433
AND HAVE NOW FILLED WITH

14:40.500 --> 14:41.233
STOLEN JEWELS, LIKE THE

14:41.300 --> 14:42.533
KOH-I-NOOR DIAMOND -- WHICH,

14:42.600 --> 14:44.166
ACCORDING TO THE TOWER'S

14:44.233 --> 14:45.566
WEBSITE, WAS "PRESENTED TO

14:45.633 --> 14:47.033
QUEEN VICTORIA."

14:47.100 --> 14:47.966
AND THAT VERB IS DOING A LOT OF

14:48.033 --> 14:49.066
HEAVY LIFTING THERE.

14:49.133 --> 14:51.900
IT WAS "PRESENTED" IN PRETTY

14:51.966 --> 14:57.500
MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT INDIA

14:57.566 --> 14:58.833
WAS, INSOMUCH AS IT WAS PRESENT

14:58.900 --> 15:01.300
AND BRITAIN FUCKING TOOK IT.

15:01.366 --> 15:02.333
AND FOR ALL THE CURRENT

15:02.400 --> 15:02.900
HAND-WRINGING ABOUT HOW ANY

15:02.966 --> 15:03.500
CHANGES WOULD POLITICIZE U.S.

15:03.566 --> 15:04.133
HISTORY, IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING

15:04.200 --> 15:04.800
THAT THE TEACHING OF IT HAS

15:04.866 --> 15:05.433
ALWAYS BEEN POLITICAL.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.400
AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, THE BATTLE

15:06.466 --> 15:07.600
OVER HOW HISTORY WOULD BE TOLD

15:07.666 --> 15:08.633
IN TEXTBOOKS WAS INTENSE.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.233
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE SAYING

15:09.300 --> 15:09.933
"HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY THE

15:10.000 --> 15:11.466
WINNERS?

15:11.533 --> 15:12.933
THE SOUTH SET OUT TO PROVE THAT

15:13.000 --> 15:13.700
WRONG.

15:13.766 --> 15:15.300
ONE ORGANIZATION, CALLED THE

15:15.366 --> 15:16.166
UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE

15:16.233 --> 15:17.200
CONFEDERACY, CAMPAIGNED FOR

15:17.266 --> 15:18.633
SCHOOLS TO ADOPT TEXTBOOKS THAT

15:18.700 --> 15:20.600
WOULD "ACCORD FULL JUSTICE TO

15:20.666 --> 15:22.300
THE SOUTH," TELLING LIBRARIANS

15:22.366 --> 15:24.533
TO WRITE "UNJUST TO THE SOUTH"

15:24.600 --> 15:27.366
ON THE ONES THAT DIDN'T.

15:27.433 --> 15:28.533
WHICH IS CLEARLY ABSURD.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.533
THAT'D BE LIKE A LIBRARIAN

15:30.600 --> 15:31.733
WRITING "UNJUST TO VOLDEMORT" ON

15:31.800 --> 15:32.966
"HARRY POTTERS" ONE THROUGH

15:33.033 --> 15:34.400
SEVEN OR "UNJUST TO WHALE" ON

15:34.466 --> 15:35.566
"MOBY DICK" OR "UNJUST TO

15:35.633 --> 15:37.400
L. RON HUBBARD" ON LEAH REMINI'S

15:37.466 --> 15:38.800
"TROUBLEMAKER: SURVIVING

15:38.866 --> 15:40.966
HOLLYWOOD AND SCIENTOLOGY."

15:41.033 --> 15:43.833
BUT THAT IMPULSE -- TO DOWNPLAY

15:43.900 --> 15:47.400
THE HORRORS OF SLAVERY -- HAS

15:47.466 --> 15:48.200
MARKED HOW SCHOOLCHILDREN HAVE

15:48.266 --> 15:50.566
LEARNED ABOUT IT EVER SINCE.

15:50.633 --> 15:51.333
A GEORGIA TEXTBOOK FROM THE

15:51.400 --> 15:52.166
'50s CLAIMED, "THE MASTER OFTEN

15:52.233 --> 15:52.966
HAD A BARBECUE OR A PICNIC FOR

15:53.033 --> 15:54.000
HIS SLAVES.

15:54.066 --> 15:55.333
THEN THEY HAD A GREAT FROLIC."

15:55.400 --> 15:57.300
AND LOOK, EVERY EXCUSE FOR

15:57.366 --> 15:58.800
SLAVERY IS SHITTY, BUT "WE GAVE

15:58.866 --> 16:00.433
THEM SANDWICHES SOMETIMES" HAS

16:00.500 --> 16:02.300
TO BE ONE OF THE SHITTIEST.

16:02.366 --> 16:03.733
AND SOME WHO LEARNED HISTORY

16:03.800 --> 16:05.033
FROM BOOKS LIKE THOSE COULDN'T

16:05.100 --> 16:07.600
BELIEVE WHAT THEY WERE BEING

16:07.666 --> 16:08.700
TOLD AT THE TIME -- JUST WATCH

16:08.766 --> 16:09.766
THIS ALABAMA SCHOOLTEACHER

16:09.833 --> 16:11.400
REVISIT HER FOURTH-GRADE

16:11.466 --> 16:13.366
TEXTBOOK, "KNOW ALABAMA":

16:13.433 --> 16:15.300
>> "SOME SLAVES WERE GOOD

16:15.366 --> 16:18.433
WORKERS AND VERY OBEDIENT.

16:18.500 --> 16:22.266
MANY TOOK PRIDE IN WHAT THEY DID

16:22.333 --> 16:24.766
AND LOVED THEIR CABINS AND THE

16:24.833 --> 16:26.133
PLANTATION AS IF THEY ACTUALLY

16:26.200 --> 16:27.966
OWNED THEM.

16:28.033 --> 16:30.566
OTHERS WERE LAZY, DISOBEDIENT,

16:30.633 --> 16:33.633
AND SOMETIMES VICIOUS."

16:33.700 --> 16:34.800
I WONDER WHAT KIND OF SLAVE I

16:34.866 --> 16:36.066
WOULD HAVE BEEN.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.400
I WONDER IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN

16:37.466 --> 16:38.600
ONE OF THOSE LAZY SLAVES WHO

16:38.666 --> 16:40.900
JUST WERE NOT WILLING TO WORK

16:40.966 --> 16:42.933
FOR NOTHING OR DISOBEDIENT

16:43.000 --> 16:44.633
BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE

16:44.700 --> 16:45.566
A SLAVE.

16:45.633 --> 16:46.700
>> John: YEAH.

16:46.766 --> 16:47.933
THAT CONTEMPT IS FULLY MERITED

16:48.000 --> 16:49.600
THERE.

16:49.666 --> 16:51.100
BECAUSE AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

16:51.166 --> 16:52.900
IDEA THAT BEING A "LAZY" SLAVE

16:52.966 --> 16:54.533
WAS A CHARACTER FLAW, AS OPPOSED

16:54.600 --> 16:55.800
TO A FREQUENT ACT OF PROTEST

16:55.866 --> 16:56.900
AGAINST A BRUTALLY UNJUST

16:56.966 --> 16:59.566
SYSTEM, IS INFURIATING.

16:59.633 --> 17:00.966
AND IT MAKES "KNOW ALABAMA"

17:01.033 --> 17:02.133
SOUND LESS LIKE THE TITLE OF

17:02.200 --> 17:03.066
THAT TEXTBOOK AND MORE LIKE

17:03.133 --> 17:04.300
SOMETHING YOU'D YELL AT IT:

17:04.366 --> 17:05.166
"NO, ALABAMA!

17:05.233 --> 17:06.566
STOP THAT!

17:06.633 --> 17:07.700
BAD TEXTBOOK!

17:07.766 --> 17:09.233
NO!"

17:09.300 --> 17:10.733
AND THOSE PASSAGES WERE IN THE

17:10.800 --> 17:12.000
STANDARD ALABAMA HISTORY

17:12.066 --> 17:13.833
TEXTBOOK INTO THE '70s.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.100
SO PEOPLE WHO READ THEM AND MAY

17:15.166 --> 17:17.233
HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY THEIR

17:17.300 --> 17:18.566
CONTENT ARE NOW IN THEIR 50s,

17:18.633 --> 17:19.666
DOING THINGS LIKE RUNNING

17:19.733 --> 17:21.100
BUSINESSES OR HOLDING ELECTED

17:21.166 --> 17:22.966
OFFICE.

17:23.033 --> 17:26.066
AND WHILE NEWER TEXTBOOKS MAY

17:26.133 --> 17:27.300
NOT BE QUITE THAT EGREGIOUS,

17:27.366 --> 17:28.166
THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS.

17:28.233 --> 17:29.233
EARLIER THIS YEAR, ONE HISTORIAN

17:29.300 --> 17:30.333
FLAGGED A PRETTY REMARKABLE

17:30.400 --> 17:31.166
EUPHEMISM IN A CURRENT TEXAS

17:31.233 --> 17:34.466
SCHOOLBOOK:

17:34.533 --> 17:35.666
>> THIS IS A PICTURE, AND THE

17:35.733 --> 17:37.300
CAPTION SAYS, "SOME U.S.

17:37.366 --> 17:39.433
SETTLERS BROUGHT SLAVES TO TEXAS

17:39.500 --> 17:40.733
TO HELP WORK THE FIELDS AND DO

17:40.800 --> 17:44.966
CHORES."

17:45.033 --> 17:46.300
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T --

17:46.366 --> 17:47.133
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DESCRIBE

17:47.200 --> 17:48.100
SLAVE LABOR AS CHORES.

17:48.166 --> 17:51.000
>> John: YEAH, WE SHOULDN'T.

17:51.066 --> 17:52.600
CALLING SLAVE LABOR "CHORES" IS

17:52.666 --> 17:53.933
A EUPHEMISM ON PAR WITH CALLING

17:54.000 --> 17:55.800
HITLER A "BEST-SELLING AUTHOR

17:55.866 --> 17:57.300
WITH A SIDE HUSTLE," OR JFK'S

17:57.366 --> 17:58.800
ASSASSINATION A "BAD HAIR DAY"

17:58.866 --> 18:01.233
OR THIS "A COMEDY SHOW."

18:01.300 --> 18:02.100
AND LOOK, STATE STANDARDS AND

18:02.166 --> 18:03.100
TEXTBOOKS ARE JUST A BASELINE

18:03.166 --> 18:04.633
HERE.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.300
WHAT HAPPENS IN A CLASSROOM

18:06.366 --> 18:08.633
LARGELY DEPENDS ON TEACHERS, WHO

18:08.700 --> 18:09.833
HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT JOB, OFTEN

18:09.900 --> 18:10.633
WORKING WITH SCANT RESOURCES,

18:10.700 --> 18:11.700
MEANING THAT, AMONG OTHER

18:11.766 --> 18:12.966
THINGS, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

18:13.033 --> 18:13.900
GET UPDATED VERSIONS OF

18:13.966 --> 18:15.733
TEXTBOOKS.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.066
AND SOME WORK TO CORRECT POOR

18:18.133 --> 18:19.266
MATERIALS.

18:19.333 --> 18:20.733
BUT OTHERS CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

18:20.800 --> 18:22.400
THINGS EVEN WORSE, WITH

18:22.466 --> 18:23.800
TONE-DEAF ASSIGNMENTS AND

18:23.866 --> 18:25.133
CLASSROOM EXERCISES THAT YOU MAY

18:25.200 --> 18:26.733
BE FAMILIAR WITH FROM LOCAL NEWS

18:26.800 --> 18:27.933
STORIES LIKE THESE:

18:28.000 --> 18:29.033
>> THIS IS THE ACTIVITY IN

18:29.100 --> 18:30.666
QUESTION.

18:30.733 --> 18:32.166
IT ASKS STUDENTS TO CHOOSE TO BE

18:32.233 --> 18:33.433
A SLAVE OR A SLAVE OWNER, AND

18:33.500 --> 18:34.700
THEN TO WRITE A JOURNAL ENTRY

18:34.766 --> 18:36.100
THAT DESCRIBES DAILY ACTIVITIES

18:36.166 --> 18:37.633
BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.133
>> THE QUESTION ABOUT SLAVERY

18:39.200 --> 18:41.033
READ, "YOU OWN A PLANTATION OR

18:41.100 --> 18:42.066
FARM AND THEREFORE NEED MORE

18:42.133 --> 18:43.800
WORKERS.

18:43.866 --> 18:45.733
SET YOUR PRICE FOR A SLAVE.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.500
THESE COULD BE WORTH A LOT.

18:48.566 --> 18:50.700
>> THIS NORTH CAROLINA

18:50.766 --> 18:51.566
GRANDMOTHER COULDN'T BELIEVE

18:51.633 --> 18:52.533
THE ASSIGNMENT GIVEN TO HER

18:52.600 --> 18:53.100
FOURTH GRADER.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.366
>> AND THEN THIS GAME IS CALLED

18:54.433 --> 18:55.266
"ESCAPING SLAVERY."

18:55.333 --> 18:56.400
>> A SLAVERY-THEMED

18:56.466 --> 18:57.366
MONOPOLY-LIKE GAME STUDENTS

18:57.433 --> 19:02.700
PLAYED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.500
CHILDREN WORKED IN SMALL GROUPS,

19:03.566 --> 19:04.900
GOT THIS "FREEDOM PUNCH CARD."

19:04.966 --> 19:05.600
IF THE GROUP RAN INTO TROUBLE,

19:05.666 --> 19:07.000
THE CARD SAID THEY'D BE SEVERELY

19:07.066 --> 19:08.400
PUNISHED AND SENT BACK TO THE

19:08.466 --> 19:10.933
PLANTATION TO WORK AS A SLAVE.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.600
>> WERE THEY GONNA HANG THEM?

19:12.666 --> 19:14.233
WERE THEY GONNA KILL 'EM?

19:14.300 --> 19:15.333
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

19:15.400 --> 19:17.266
DOING THERE?

19:17.333 --> 19:18.266
YOU CAN'T REDUCE A PERSON'S

19:18.333 --> 19:19.600
FREEDOM FROM SLAVERY DOWN TO

19:19.666 --> 19:20.700
WHAT IS BASICALLY A JIMMY JOHN'S

19:20.766 --> 19:22.100
PUNCH CARD.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.666
AND JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD

19:23.733 --> 19:25.833
FEEL LIKE TO BE A BLACK KID IN

19:25.900 --> 19:26.933
THAT CLASSROOM -- OR, IF YOU

19:27.000 --> 19:29.033
DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE, REMEMBER.

19:29.100 --> 19:33.233
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE

19:33.300 --> 19:33.966
HISTORY THAT HURTS HERE, IT'S

19:34.033 --> 19:34.766
HOW YOU'RE BEING MADE TO FEEL

19:34.833 --> 19:35.566
WHILE YOU LEARN IT.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.833
AND THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH

19:36.900 --> 19:37.866
STORIES LIKE THOSE TEND TO CROP

19:37.933 --> 19:38.800
UP MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH

19:38.866 --> 19:39.933
THE FACT THAT THE OVERWHELMING

19:40.000 --> 19:41.866
MAJORITY OF SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE

19:41.933 --> 19:45.500
WHITE AND MANY MAY'VE GREW UP

19:45.566 --> 19:46.233
LEARNING THE SAME SKEWED VERSION

19:46.300 --> 19:47.200
OF HISTORY THAT THEY'RE NOW

19:47.266 --> 19:48.433
PASSING ON.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.433
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

19:49.500 --> 19:50.766
TOGETHER, WE'RE GIVING KIDS

19:50.833 --> 19:51.900
INCOMPLETE EDUCATIONS IN

19:51.966 --> 19:52.966
HISTORY, WHILE ALSO DOING REAL

19:53.033 --> 19:54.300
HARM.

19:54.366 --> 19:55.833
BECAUSE THOSE KIDS GROW UP.

19:55.900 --> 19:56.866
JUST LISTEN TO THIS GUY FROM

19:56.933 --> 19:58.133
TULSA EXPLAINING HOW HE FELT

19:58.200 --> 19:59.933
WHEN HE FINALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT

20:00.000 --> 20:02.400
THAT 1921 MASSACRE WHERE HE

20:02.466 --> 20:05.066
LIVED.

20:05.133 --> 20:07.266
>> WHEN I WENT TO OU IN 1998, I

20:07.333 --> 20:09.133
WAS SITTING IN A CLASS OF

20:09.200 --> 20:10.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY.

20:10.066 --> 20:12.466
AND THE PROFESSOR WAS TALKING

20:12.533 --> 20:14.033
ABOUT THIS PLACE WHERE

20:14.100 --> 20:15.333
BLACK PEOPLE HAD BUSINESSES AND

20:15.400 --> 20:16.233
HAD MONEY AND HAD DOCTORS AND

20:16.300 --> 20:17.400
LAWYERS.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.333
AND HE SAID IT WAS IN TULSA.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.133
AND I RAISED MY HAND, I SAID,

20:22.200 --> 20:24.466
"NO, I'M FROM TULSA.

20:24.533 --> 20:26.166
THAT'S NOT ACCURATE."

20:26.233 --> 20:27.566
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS

20:27.633 --> 20:28.366
MASSACRE, RIOT.

20:28.433 --> 20:29.166
I SAID, "MAN, WHAT ARE YOU

20:29.233 --> 20:30.233
TALKING ABOUT?"

20:30.300 --> 20:31.166
I SAID, "I WENT TO SCHOOL ON

20:31.233 --> 20:31.700
GREENWOOD.

20:31.766 --> 20:37.266
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS EVER."

20:37.333 --> 20:38.833
>> John: THAT'S TERRIBLE.

20:38.900 --> 20:39.466
AND HIS SCHOOL REALLY LET

20:39.533 --> 20:40.133
HIM DOWN THERE.

20:40.200 --> 20:40.800
THINK OF THE EMOTIONAL WHIPLASH

20:40.866 --> 20:41.433
THAT MAN WENT THROUGH.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.200
HE FOUND OUT SOMETHING AMAZING

20:42.266 --> 20:43.200
HAD ONCE EXISTED RIGHT WHERE HE

20:43.266 --> 20:44.700
LIVED, SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAD

20:44.766 --> 20:45.633
TAKEN IT AWAY, AND THAT THE

20:45.700 --> 20:51.000
HISTORY HAD BEEN KEPT FROM HIM.

20:51.066 --> 20:52.300
AND ALL OF THIS HAD HAPPENED

20:52.366 --> 20:52.900
LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

20:52.966 --> 20:53.933
THE DINOSAURS DIED 65 MILLION

20:54.000 --> 20:54.900
YEARS AGO, AND YOU'D STILL BE

20:54.966 --> 20:56.166
FLOORED IF SOMEONE ONLY JUST

20:56.233 --> 20:57.466
TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM.

20:57.533 --> 20:58.500
"I'M SORRY, THERE WERE WHAT?

20:58.566 --> 21:00.000
WHERE?

21:00.066 --> 21:00.700
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'EVERYWHERE'?

21:00.766 --> 21:04.266
AND THEY WERE HOW BIG?

21:04.333 --> 21:04.866
SOME OF THEM COULD FLY?

21:04.933 --> 21:06.300
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

21:06.366 --> 21:07.100
OH, NO!

21:07.166 --> 21:07.800
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS THE FIRST

21:07.866 --> 21:08.833
TIME SOMEONE'S MENTIONING THIS

21:08.900 --> 21:11.166
TO ME?"

21:11.233 --> 21:12.266
LOOK, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WE NEED

21:12.333 --> 21:13.666
TO UPGRADE THE WAY WE TEACH OUR

21:13.733 --> 21:14.700
HISTORY.

21:14.766 --> 21:15.833
AND WHILE I OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE

21:15.900 --> 21:17.300
TIME TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT

21:17.366 --> 21:18.633
HISTORY RIGHT NOW, IT MIGHT BE

21:18.700 --> 21:19.933
WORTH GOING SLOWLY THROUGH THREE

21:20.000 --> 21:21.366
BIG MISTAKES THAT MANY

21:21.433 --> 21:22.666
HISTORIANS BELIEVE WE MAKE AND

21:22.733 --> 21:24.333
SHOULD CORRECT IN SCHOOLS AND

21:24.400 --> 21:26.366
BEYOND.

21:26.433 --> 21:27.733
THE FIRST IS THAT WE DON'T FULLY

21:27.800 --> 21:29.366
ACKNOWLEDGE THE HISTORY OF WHITE

21:29.433 --> 21:30.866
SUPREMACY IN AMERICA, FROM ITS

21:30.933 --> 21:32.500
FOUNDING TO THE PRESENT DAY.

21:32.566 --> 21:33.733
AND I KNOW THAT ANYTIME SOMEONE

21:33.800 --> 21:35.600
SUGGESTS TELLING CHILDREN

21:35.666 --> 21:37.266
ANYTHING LESS THAN "JESUS WOULD

21:37.333 --> 21:38.500
HAVE BEEN BEST FRIENDS WITH

21:38.566 --> 21:39.900
ABRAHAM LINCOLN," THE PUSHBACK

21:39.966 --> 21:40.966
IS FIERCE.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.466
WATCH LAURA INGRAHAM TAKE ONE

21:42.533 --> 21:43.666
SCHOOL BOARD'S DISCUSSION OF AN

21:43.733 --> 21:45.066
ANTI-RACIST CURRICULUM AND SPIN

21:45.133 --> 21:46.766
IT OUT INTO A DYSTOPIAN VISION

21:46.833 --> 21:49.733
DESIGNED TO TERRIFY HER VIEWERS.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.100
>> NOW, EVERY SUBJECT, EVERY

21:52.166 --> 21:53.900
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY WILL BE

21:53.966 --> 21:55.266
PERVERTED TO TURN YOUR KIDS INTO

21:55.333 --> 21:56.433
MINI ILHAN OMARS.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.266
THEY'RE GONNA LEARN THAT

21:59.333 --> 22:01.100
CAPITALISM IS RACIST, HISTORY AS

22:01.166 --> 22:02.800
CONVENTIONALLY TAUGHT IS RACIST,

22:02.866 --> 22:04.066
LITERATURE -- MOST OF THAT'S

22:04.133 --> 22:05.566
RACIST -- PATRIOTIC SONGS,

22:05.633 --> 22:09.500
RACIST.

22:09.566 --> 22:10.266
AND THE DECLARATION AND THE

22:10.333 --> 22:11.066
CONSTITUTION, OF COURSE, THEY'RE

22:11.133 --> 22:12.900
RACIST.

22:12.966 --> 22:13.633
ARE YOU SENSING A THEME HERE?

22:13.700 --> 22:14.866
>> John: NOW, LAURA INGRAHAM

22:14.933 --> 22:15.800
MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE SOMEONE

22:15.866 --> 22:17.366
CAPABLE OF FOLLOWING ANYTHING,

22:17.433 --> 22:18.600
APART FROM BLACK TEENAGERS

22:18.666 --> 22:22.333
SIMPLY TRYING TO SHOP AT CVS,

22:22.400 --> 22:23.333
BUT I THINK SHE HAS

22:23.400 --> 22:24.266
PICKED UP ON A THEME THERE,

22:24.333 --> 22:25.166
BECAUSE, SEEING AS SHE BROUGHT

22:25.233 --> 22:25.866
UP THE CONSTITUTION, LET'S TALK

22:25.933 --> 22:26.866
ABOUT IT.

22:26.933 --> 22:28.100
THAT DOCUMENT IS A LOT OF

22:28.166 --> 22:29.266
THINGS -- GENUINELY

22:29.333 --> 22:30.733
REVOLUTIONARY AND THE FOUNDATION

22:30.800 --> 22:32.200
OF AN IMPROBABLY LONG-LIVED

22:32.266 --> 22:34.133
DEMOCRACY -- BUT IT IS INFUSED

22:34.200 --> 22:35.666
WITH AND INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO

22:35.733 --> 22:36.866
SLAVERY AND A LEGACY OF RACIAL

22:36.933 --> 22:38.333
INEQUALITY.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.733
FROM THE THREE-FIFTHS CLAUSE

22:39.800 --> 22:41.400
THROUGH THE FUGITIVE SLAVE

22:41.466 --> 22:45.333
CLAUSE, THE CONSTITUTION BOTH

22:45.400 --> 22:46.066
CODIFIED SLAVERY AND MADE IT

22:46.133 --> 22:46.933
HARDER FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ESCAPE

22:47.000 --> 22:49.133
IT.

22:49.200 --> 22:55.766
AND THE FACT THE CONSTITUTION

22:55.833 --> 22:56.533
IS INFUSED WITH RACISM DOES NOT

22:56.600 --> 22:56.966
MEAN IT'S CANCELED.

22:57.033 --> 22:57.733
IT'S NOT A YOUTUBER WHO'S JUST

22:57.800 --> 22:58.433
NOW REALIZING IT WAS WRONG TO DO

22:58.500 --> 22:59.033
BLACKFACE FOR 14 YEARS.

22:59.100 --> 22:59.800
AND IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T MEAN

22:59.866 --> 23:00.800
THAT KIDS SHOULDN'T LEARN ABOUT

23:00.866 --> 23:01.700
IT.

23:01.766 --> 23:02.733
BUT THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO SEE

23:02.800 --> 23:03.800
IT AS AN IMPERFECT DOCUMENT WITH

23:03.866 --> 23:05.100
IMPERFECT AUTHORS WHO BOTH

23:05.166 --> 23:06.800
EXTOLLED THE IDEALS OF FREEDOM

23:06.866 --> 23:08.333
FOR ALL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

23:08.400 --> 23:11.966
CODIFYING SLAVERY.

23:12.033 --> 23:12.800
AND THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DO.

23:12.866 --> 23:13.600
KIDS CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS

23:13.666 --> 23:15.000
CAN BE RACIST AND ALSO OTHER

23:15.066 --> 23:16.333
THINGS.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.433
THE CONSTITUTION CAN BE

23:17.500 --> 23:19.033
REVOLUTIONARY AND ALSO RACIST.

23:19.100 --> 23:19.900
MOVIES CAN BE ROMANTIC AND ALSO

23:19.966 --> 23:21.466
RACIST.

23:21.533 --> 23:22.433
CHILDREN'S BOOKS CAN BE CHARMING

23:22.500 --> 23:24.100
AND ALSO RACIST.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.133
BROADCASTERS CAN BE INCREDIBLY

23:26.200 --> 23:28.566
SUCCESSFUL AND ALSO RACIST.

23:28.633 --> 23:31.833
AND IF KIDS ARE TAUGHT AN

23:31.900 --> 23:32.600
INCOMPLETE HISTORY, THEY EITHER

23:32.666 --> 23:33.433
NEVER GET THE FULL STORY OR,

23:33.500 --> 23:34.466
WHEN THEY DO, DON'T HAVE THE

23:34.533 --> 23:35.733
FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

23:35.800 --> 23:36.733
PIECES FIT TOGETHER.

23:36.800 --> 23:37.833
HERE'S ONE PROFESSOR, EXPLAINING

23:37.900 --> 23:39.000
HOW HARD IT CAN BE FOR HIS

23:39.066 --> 23:40.033
STUDENTS LEARNING THE WHOLE

23:40.100 --> 23:42.433
TRUTH ABOUT THOMAS JEFFERSON.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.033
>> WHAT THAT CHILD IS THEN GONNA

23:44.100 --> 23:46.000
DO IS SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE, WHY

23:46.066 --> 23:49.400
DIDN'T I KNOW THIS BEFORE?

23:49.466 --> 23:50.633
I'VE BEEN RUNNING AROUND HERE

23:50.700 --> 23:51.933
SINGING THOMAS JEFFERSON'S

23:52.000 --> 23:53.166
PRAISES AND I DIDN'T REALIZE

23:53.233 --> 23:54.166
THAT HE'S THE R. KELLY OF HIS

23:54.233 --> 23:55.200
TIME."

23:55.266 --> 23:59.333
>> SO WHILE IT MAY BE

23:59.400 --> 24:01.133
UNCOMFORTABLE, HE SAYS YOU HAVE

24:01.200 --> 24:01.633
TO BE HONEST.

24:01.700 --> 24:02.466
>> I SWEAR OHIOANS SUFFER FROM

24:02.533 --> 24:03.200
UNDERGROUND RAILROAD-ITIS,

24:03.266 --> 24:03.966
RIGHT?

24:04.033 --> 24:04.766
>> OH, YEAH.

24:04.833 --> 24:05.666
>> YOU ASK THEM, "WHO WOULD HAVE

24:05.733 --> 24:06.300
BEEN -- WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR

24:06.366 --> 24:07.133
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD?"

24:07.200 --> 24:08.233
RIGHT?

24:08.300 --> 24:09.000
IN CLASS, EVERY, EVERY WHITE

24:09.066 --> 24:10.533
HAND GOES -- I MEAN, LOOK, IF

24:10.600 --> 24:11.266
ALL Y'ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN

24:11.333 --> 24:12.466
FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD,

24:12.533 --> 24:13.133
THIS [BLEEP] WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

24:13.200 --> 24:13.866
UNDERGROUND, RIGHT?

24:13.933 --> 24:14.666
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NEED

24:14.733 --> 24:16.833
FOR IT.

24:16.900 --> 24:17.833
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IT

24:17.900 --> 24:18.733
SAYS A LOT ABOUT JEFFERSON THAT,

24:18.800 --> 24:20.133
IF YOU WENT BACK IN TIME,

24:20.200 --> 24:21.266
EXPLAINED TO HIM WHO R. KELLY

24:21.333 --> 24:22.233
WAS, AND TOLD HIM HE WAS BEING

24:22.300 --> 24:23.700
COMPARED TO HIM, THE CHILD

24:23.766 --> 24:24.666
PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES WOULD NOT BE

24:24.733 --> 24:26.200
THE NUMBER ONE REASON HE'D BE

24:26.266 --> 24:28.466
INSULTED BY THE COMPARISON.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.866
BUT THAT PROFESSOR MAKES A GOOD

24:30.933 --> 24:32.166
POINT.

24:32.233 --> 24:33.866
THE LESS YOU KNOW ABOUT HISTORY,

24:33.933 --> 24:35.666
THE EASIER IT IS TO IMAGINE

24:35.733 --> 24:36.600
YOU'D ALWAYS BE ON THE RIGHT

24:36.666 --> 24:37.933
SIDE OF IT, BECAUSE THE TRUTH

24:38.000 --> 24:39.066
IS, THE HISTORY OF AMERICA IS A

24:39.133 --> 24:40.800
HISTORY OF CHANGING AN AMERICA

24:40.866 --> 24:42.333
THAT BADLY DOES NOT WANT TO BE

24:42.400 --> 24:49.900
CHANGED.

24:49.966 --> 24:50.566
THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO THE

24:50.633 --> 24:51.266
SECOND COMMON MISTAKE WE MAKE:

24:51.333 --> 24:52.233
VIEWING AMERICAN HISTORY'S

24:52.300 --> 24:53.033
PROGRESS AS IF IT WAS CONSTANTLY

24:53.100 --> 24:53.966
AND INEVITABLY UPWARD.

24:54.033 --> 24:55.200
TOO OFTEN, U.S. HISTORY IS

24:55.266 --> 24:56.900
REDUCED DOWN TO, "THERE WAS

24:56.966 --> 24:58.200
SLAVERY, THEN THERE WAS A

24:58.266 --> 24:59.633
CIVIL WAR, THEN THERE WASN'T

24:59.700 --> 25:01.200
SLAVERY ANYMORE, THEN THERE WAS

25:01.266 --> 25:02.433
A CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, THEN

25:02.500 --> 25:03.166
THERE WASN'T RACISM ANYMORE."

25:03.233 --> 25:04.100
JUST A SMOOTH, STEADY UPWARD

25:04.166 --> 25:04.933
ARC.

25:05.000 --> 25:05.900
BUT THE MOMENTS ON EITHER SIDE

25:05.966 --> 25:07.100
OF THOSE LANDMARK ERAS

25:07.166 --> 25:08.166
COMPLICATE THE HELL OUT OF THAT

25:08.233 --> 25:09.033
ARC, BECAUSE THEY WERE FILLED

25:09.100 --> 25:09.900
WITH WHITE HOSTILITY AND UGLY

25:09.966 --> 25:11.466
BACKSLIDING.

25:11.533 --> 25:12.633
TAKE THE CENTURY BETWEEN

25:12.700 --> 25:14.500
THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR AND THE

25:14.566 --> 25:16.000
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, WHICH IS OFTEN

25:16.066 --> 25:17.000
GLOSSED OVER BUT SHOULD PROBABLY

25:17.066 --> 25:20.000
BE TAUGHT A LOT MORE THOROUGHLY.

25:20.066 --> 25:21.533
IT BEGINS WITH RECONSTRUCTION, A

25:21.600 --> 25:23.066
DOZEN OR SO YEARS OF REAL

25:23.133 --> 25:24.733
PROMISE, WHEN, VERY BASICALLY,

25:24.800 --> 25:26.166
THE SOUTH WAS FORCED TO REDRAW

25:26.233 --> 25:27.133
THEIR CONSTITUTIONS AND PERMIT

25:27.200 --> 25:28.000
THE REGISTRATION OF BLACK

25:28.066 --> 25:30.800
VOTERS.

25:30.866 --> 25:31.666
THAT'S RIGHT, BLACK MEN

25:31.733 --> 25:39.833
IN THE SOUTH WERE VOTING IN THE

25:39.900 --> 25:40.800
1860s AND 1870s.

25:40.866 --> 25:41.533
WHEN THEY FOUGHT FOR THE

25:41.600 --> 25:42.266
VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN THE 1960s,

25:42.333 --> 25:43.000
THEY WERE FIGHTING TO GET BACK

25:43.066 --> 25:43.700
SOMETHING THEY'D ALREADY HAD.

25:43.766 --> 25:44.633
THE EFFECTS OF RECONSTRUCTION

25:44.700 --> 25:45.533
WERE ALMOST IMMEDIATE, WITH AN

25:45.600 --> 25:46.266
ESTIMATED 2,000 BLACK MEN

25:46.333 --> 25:47.066
SERVING IN ELECTIVE OFFICE

25:47.133 --> 25:47.966
DURING THAT ERA, INCLUDING A

25:48.033 --> 25:49.033
NUMBER IN CONGRESS.

25:49.100 --> 25:52.133
AND JUST LOOK AT THESE GUYS.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.000
A-PLUS ACHIEVEMENT, A-PLUS-PLUS

25:53.066 --> 25:56.633
FACIAL HAIR.

25:56.700 --> 25:57.533
AND SURE, YOU THINK YOU CAN GROW

25:57.600 --> 26:00.200
YOUR MUSTACHE INTO YOUR BEARD --

26:00.266 --> 26:01.966
TRY IT, YOU FUCKING CAN'T.

26:02.033 --> 26:02.700
BUT IN RESPONSE TO THAT

26:02.766 --> 26:07.266
PROGRESS, WHITE PEOPLE PUSHED

26:07.333 --> 26:08.400
BACK AND PUSHED BACK HARD.

26:08.466 --> 26:09.233
THE KKK WAS FOUNDED, 2,000 BLACK

26:09.300 --> 26:10.066
PEOPLE WERE LYNCHED, AND BY

26:10.133 --> 26:11.000
1877, THE SOUTH HAD REGAINED

26:11.066 --> 26:14.866
LOCAL CONTROL.

26:14.933 --> 26:15.500
HERE IS A CRAZY STORY YOU MIGHT

26:15.566 --> 26:16.900
NOT KNOW:

26:16.966 --> 26:18.000
IN 1898, THE MULTI-RACIAL CITY

26:18.066 --> 26:19.433
GOVERNMENT IN WILMINGTON,

26:19.500 --> 26:20.833
NORTH CAROLINA, BECAME THE

26:20.900 --> 26:22.533
TARGET OF THE "ONLY COUP D'ETAT

26:22.600 --> 26:24.166
EVER TO TAKE PLACE ON AMERICAN

26:24.233 --> 26:25.733
SOIL," IN WHICH A MOB OF UP TO

26:25.800 --> 26:27.200
2,000 ARMED WHITE MEN KILLED AT

26:27.266 --> 26:28.766
LEAST 60 BLACK RESIDENTS AND

26:28.833 --> 26:30.333
REPLACED THE CITY'S ALDERMEN

26:30.400 --> 26:33.366
WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

26:33.433 --> 26:34.933
AND IF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

26:35.000 --> 26:37.233
YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE ONLY

26:37.300 --> 26:39.566
COUP ON AMERICAN SOIL, YOU'RE

26:39.633 --> 26:40.766
NOT ALONE, BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED

26:40.833 --> 26:41.900
THERE IS USUALLY EITHER NOT

26:42.000 --> 26:43.166
TAUGHT AT ALL, OR, AS THE AUTHOR

26:43.233 --> 26:45.566
OF A BOOK ON THAT MASSACRE

26:45.633 --> 26:46.566
POINTS OUT, TAUGHT VERY, VERY

26:46.633 --> 26:48.533
MISLEADINGLY.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.366
>> HERE'S FROM A 1949 TEXTBOOK

26:51.433 --> 26:52.366
QUOTE, "A NUMBER OF BLACKS WERE

26:52.433 --> 26:53.366
JAILED FOR STARTING A RIOT AND A

26:53.433 --> 26:55.100
NEW WHITE ADMINISTRATION TOOK

26:55.166 --> 26:56.000
OVER WILMINGTON'S GOVERNMENT,"

26:56.066 --> 26:57.766
END QUOTE.

26:57.833 --> 27:02.133
>> John: YEAH.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.000
THAT'S IT.

27:03.066 --> 27:05.200
AND THAT IS NOT JUST DENYING

27:05.266 --> 27:05.733
WHAT HAPPENED -- IT'S EVEN

27:05.800 --> 27:06.100
WORSE.

27:06.166 --> 27:06.933
IT'S PLACING THE BLAME FOR IT ON

27:07.000 --> 27:07.566
THE VICTIMS.

27:07.633 --> 27:08.633
TECHNICALLY, YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN

27:08.700 --> 27:09.633
CALL IT A HISTORY BOOK SO MUCH

27:09.700 --> 27:11.466
AS "A BOOK OF LIES BECAUSE WE

27:11.533 --> 27:13.166
KIND OF FELT A BIT WEIRD ABOUT

27:13.233 --> 27:13.766
THAT WHOLE VIOLENT RACIST COUP

27:13.833 --> 27:14.700
THING."

27:14.766 --> 27:15.500
AND WILMINGTON WASN'T EVEN THE

27:15.566 --> 27:16.500
MIDPOINT OF THAT CENTURY OF

27:16.566 --> 27:17.666
BACKSLIDING.

27:17.733 --> 27:22.366
AND THE LAURA INGRAHAMS OF THE

27:22.433 --> 27:24.000
WORLD WILL PROBABLY SAY, YEAH,

27:24.066 --> 27:25.366
THAT'S ALL UGLY, BUT IN A SIGN

27:25.433 --> 27:26.000
OF AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, THE

27:26.066 --> 27:26.500
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

27:26.566 --> 27:27.300
ENDED ALL OF THAT WHEN

27:27.366 --> 27:28.033
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S DREAM CAME

27:28.100 --> 27:29.200
TRUE.

27:29.266 --> 27:30.233
AND THAT IS THE VERSION THAT

27:30.300 --> 27:31.300
MOST AMERICANS ARE TAUGHT IN

27:31.366 --> 27:32.333
SCHOOL.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.566
BUT IT LEAVES A LOT OUT.

27:33.633 --> 27:34.266
IN FACT, TAKE THE MARCH ON

27:34.333 --> 27:38.100
WASHINGTON.

27:38.166 --> 27:38.700
THAT WASN'T ACTUALLY ITS FULL

27:38.766 --> 27:39.266
NAME.

27:39.333 --> 27:40.033
IT WAS CALLED THE

27:40.100 --> 27:40.966
"MARCH ON WASHINGTON

27:41.033 --> 27:41.966
FOR JOBS AND FREEDOM," AND THE

27:42.033 --> 27:42.733
ECONOMIC JUSTICE PART OF IT WAS

27:42.800 --> 27:44.100
FRONT AND CENTER.

27:44.166 --> 27:45.300
KING ACTUALLY GREW MORE

27:45.366 --> 27:46.333
OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THAT ISSUE IN

27:46.400 --> 27:47.433
THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.900
AND KING HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD WHY

27:49.000 --> 27:50.400
IT WAS HARDER TO MAKE PROGRESS

27:50.466 --> 27:52.666
ON THAT FRONT.

27:52.733 --> 27:54.533
>> IT DIDN'T COST THE NATION ONE

27:54.600 --> 27:55.566
PENNY TO INTEGRATE LUNCH

27:55.633 --> 27:58.500
COUNTERS.

27:58.566 --> 28:00.400
IT DIDN'T COST THE NATION ONE

28:00.466 --> 28:01.533
PENNY TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO

28:01.600 --> 28:05.666
VOTE.

28:05.733 --> 28:08.733
NOW WE ARE DEALING WITH ISSUES

28:08.800 --> 28:10.233
THAT CANNOT BE SOLVED WITHOUT

28:10.300 --> 28:12.933
THE NATION SPENDING BILLIONS OF

28:13.000 --> 28:14.500
DOLLARS AND UNDERGOING A RADICAL

28:14.566 --> 28:15.766
REDISTRIBUTION OF ECONOMIC

28:15.833 --> 28:17.733
POWER.

28:17.800 --> 28:18.700
>> John: YEAH, IT TURNS OUT THAT

28:18.766 --> 28:19.733
MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD MORE THAN

28:19.800 --> 28:26.533
ONE DREAM.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.500
AND ONE OF THEM WAS ABOUT WEALTH

28:28.566 --> 28:28.866
REDISTRIBUTION.

28:28.933 --> 28:29.433
SO WHILE I KNOW IT'S EASY TO

28:29.500 --> 28:30.066
DISTORT KING'S FULL LEGACY DOWN

28:30.133 --> 28:30.633
TO THAT ONE SOARING SPEECH,

28:30.700 --> 28:31.600
POINT TO THE CAST OF

28:31.666 --> 28:35.466
"THIS IS US," AND SAY, "SEE?

28:35.533 --> 28:36.066
WE DID IT, EVERYONE.

28:36.133 --> 28:36.633
EVERYTHING IS FIXED NOW."

28:36.700 --> 28:37.733
THE TRUTH IS, THE CIVIL RIGHTS

28:37.800 --> 28:38.333
MOVEMENT WAS LONGER, MESSIER,

28:38.400 --> 28:39.333
MORE RADICAL, AND, CRUCIALLY,

28:39.400 --> 28:40.400
WAS THWARTED IN MORE OF ITS AIMS

28:40.466 --> 28:41.533
THAN MANY OF US WERE TAUGHT IN

28:41.600 --> 28:43.833
SCHOOL.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.366
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE FINAL

28:45.433 --> 28:46.333
POINT, WHICH IS THAT WE DON'T

28:46.400 --> 28:47.700
CONNECT THE DOTS TO THE PRESENT.

28:47.766 --> 28:48.700
AND THOSE DOTS ARE VERY MUCH

28:48.766 --> 28:51.300
THERE.

28:51.366 --> 28:52.000
LOOK AT THE BLACK-WHITE WAGE AND

28:52.066 --> 28:53.533
WEALTH GAPS.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.700
THEY'RE BOTH LARGER NOW THAN

28:54.766 --> 28:55.833
THEY WERE WHEN KING GAVE THAT

28:55.900 --> 28:56.933
SPEECH.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.466
AND OUR HOUSING AND EDUCATION

28:58.533 --> 28:59.800
SYSTEMS, EVEN IN LIBERAL CITIES

28:59.866 --> 29:01.233
LIKE NEW YORK AND L.A., ARE

29:01.300 --> 29:03.333
STILL SHAMEFULLY SEGREGATED.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.366
AND IF YOU DON'T TEACH HISTORY

29:04.433 --> 29:06.533
PROPERLY, ALL YOU SEE IS THOSE

29:06.600 --> 29:08.466
EFFECTS AND NOT THE CAUSES, WHEN

29:08.533 --> 29:09.700
THE TRUTH IS, YOU CAN DRAW A

29:09.766 --> 29:12.033
STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE

29:12.100 --> 29:13.100
POST-CIVIL WAR RETURN OF

29:13.166 --> 29:16.933
PLANTATION LAND TO ITS FORMER

29:17.000 --> 29:17.733
CONFEDERATES THROUGH THE

29:17.800 --> 29:18.400
MASSIVE TRANSFERS OF LAND

29:18.466 --> 29:19.266
THROUGH THE HOMESTEAD ACT --

29:19.333 --> 29:20.133
MOSTLY TO WHITE INDIVIDUALS --

29:20.200 --> 29:21.366
THROUGH THE GROWTH OF THE

29:21.433 --> 29:22.566
SUBURBS IN THE 20TH CENTURY,

29:22.633 --> 29:23.800
WHERE RED-LINING KEPT BLACK

29:23.866 --> 29:24.666
PEOPLE FROM MOVING INTO WHITE

29:24.733 --> 29:25.933
NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE

29:26.000 --> 29:29.033
COUNTRY.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.833
IN FACT, JUST LISTEN TO THIS

29:30.900 --> 29:31.500
WOMAN IN LEVITTOWN,

29:31.566 --> 29:32.166
PENNSYLVANIA, EXPLAIN

29:32.233 --> 29:33.300
HER OBJECTIONS TO A BLACK FAMILY

29:33.366 --> 29:34.233
MOVING TO TOWN IN 1957 WITH SOME

29:34.300 --> 29:37.200
REAL HONESTY.

29:37.266 --> 29:38.100
>> WE LIKED THE ADVANTAGES THAT

29:38.166 --> 29:39.600
LEVITTOWN SEEMED TO OFFER IN

29:39.666 --> 29:42.500
COMPARISON TO OTHER CITIES.

29:42.566 --> 29:43.900
AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS

29:43.966 --> 29:44.833
GOING TO BE ALL WHITE AND WE

29:44.900 --> 29:45.433
WERE VERY HAPPY TO BUY A HOME

29:45.500 --> 29:46.366
HERE.

29:46.433 --> 29:47.700
>> DO YOU THINK A NEGRO FAMILY

29:47.766 --> 29:48.633
MOVING HERE WILL AFFECT THE

29:48.700 --> 29:51.000
COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE?

29:51.066 --> 29:52.800
>> DEFINITELY.

29:52.866 --> 29:55.166
THE WHOLE TROUBLE WITH THIS

29:55.233 --> 29:57.333
INTEGRATION BUSINESS IS THAT, IN

29:57.400 --> 29:58.366
THE END, IT PROBABLY WILL END UP

29:58.433 --> 30:00.466
WITH -- WITH MIXING SOCIALLY.

30:00.533 --> 30:02.400
AND YOU WILL HAVE -- WELL, I

30:02.466 --> 30:03.700
THINK THEIR AIM IS MIXED

30:03.766 --> 30:06.200
MARRIAGES AND BECOMING EQUAL

30:06.266 --> 30:07.866
WITH THE WHITES.

30:07.933 --> 30:10.966
>> John: WOW.

30:11.033 --> 30:11.733
IT IS ALWAYS WEIRD TO HEAR

30:11.800 --> 30:12.433
SOMEONE -- WHETHER OR NOT THEY

30:12.500 --> 30:13.233
LOOK LIKE SUMMER CASUAL

30:13.300 --> 30:14.366
BETTY CROCKER -- FRAME

30:14.433 --> 30:15.400
"HUMAN BEINGS BEING TREATED

30:15.466 --> 30:17.500
EQUALLY" AS A NEGATIVE.

30:17.566 --> 30:18.766
IT'S LIKE HEARING SOMEONE SAY

30:18.833 --> 30:19.900
"THE WHOLE TROUBLE WITH PUTTING

30:19.966 --> 30:20.900
GRAHAM CRACKERS, CHOCOLATE BARS,

30:20.966 --> 30:22.066
AND MARSHMALLOWS TOGETHER IS

30:22.133 --> 30:23.066
THAT WE MIGHT END UP WITH

30:23.133 --> 30:27.533
S'MORES."

30:27.600 --> 30:29.500
YEAH, EXACTLY.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.533
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.400
ONLY A FUCKING MONSTER WOULDN'T

30:33.466 --> 30:33.900
WANT THAT.

30:33.966 --> 30:34.666
AND IT MIGHT NOT SURPRISE YOU TO

30:34.733 --> 30:37.500
SEE THAT SOMEONE WAS INCREDIBLY

30:37.566 --> 30:38.066
RACIST IN THE 1950s.

30:38.133 --> 30:38.866
BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE

30:38.933 --> 30:39.633
WAY WE TEACH HISTORY IS THAT,

30:39.700 --> 30:40.600
TOO OFTEN, IT SORT OF TRAILS OFF

30:40.666 --> 30:41.866
AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

30:41.933 --> 30:42.733
AND WHEN YOU SKIP OVER THE PAST

30:42.800 --> 30:44.900
HALF-CENTURY OF HISTORY, YOU

30:44.966 --> 30:45.866
DON'T GET TO SEE THE PROCESS BY

30:45.933 --> 30:47.200
WHICH WHITE SUPREMACY, INSTEAD

30:47.266 --> 30:51.633
OF DISAPPEARING, MERELY ADAPTED.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.800
AND PERHAPS NOBODY MADE THAT

30:53.866 --> 30:54.533
PROCESS CLEARER THAN

30:54.600 --> 30:55.033
LEE ATWATER, A TOP

30:55.100 --> 30:55.966
REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST

30:56.033 --> 30:56.666
WHO WORKED FOR, AMONG OTHERS,

30:56.733 --> 30:57.500
RONALD REAGAN AND

30:57.566 --> 30:59.200
GEORGE H.W. BUSH.

30:59.266 --> 31:01.833
HERE HE IS SPELLING OUT THE

31:01.900 --> 31:03.000
WHOLE GAME IN 1981 -- AND I'M

31:03.066 --> 31:04.733
GOING TO WARN YOU, YOU'RE ABOUT

31:04.800 --> 31:06.633
TO HEAR THE N-WORD A LOT.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.433
>> YOU START OUT IN 1954 BY

31:08.500 --> 31:09.233
SAYING, "NIGGER, NIGGER,

31:09.300 --> 31:10.466
NIGGER."

31:10.533 --> 31:11.900
BY 1968, YOU CAN'T SAY

31:11.966 --> 31:12.666
"NIGGER" -- THAT HURTS YOU,

31:12.733 --> 31:14.133
BACKFIRES.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.200
SO YOU SAY STUFF LIKE, UH,

31:16.266 --> 31:17.500
"FORCED BUSING," "STATES'

31:17.566 --> 31:19.300
RIGHTS," AND ALL THAT STUFF, AND

31:19.366 --> 31:21.366
YOU'RE GETTING SO ABSTRACT.

31:21.433 --> 31:23.766
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING

31:23.833 --> 31:24.733
TAXES, AND ALL THESE THINGS

31:24.800 --> 31:25.933
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE TOTALLY

31:26.000 --> 31:27.866
ECONOMIC THINGS, AND A BYPRODUCT

31:27.933 --> 31:29.166
OF THEM IS, BLACKS GET HURT

31:29.233 --> 31:33.566
WORSE THAN WHITES.

31:33.633 --> 31:34.933
"WE WANT TO CUT THIS" IS MUCH

31:35.000 --> 31:36.333
MORE ABSTRACT THAN EVEN THE

31:36.400 --> 31:38.366
BUSING THING, UH, AND A HELL OF

31:38.433 --> 31:40.866
A LOT MORE ABSTRACT THAN

31:40.933 --> 31:45.100
"NIGGER, NIGGER."

31:45.166 --> 31:45.933
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

31:46.000 --> 31:46.933
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S A LITTLE TOO

31:47.000 --> 31:47.766
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WORD.

31:47.833 --> 31:49.066
YOU TEND TO ONLY HEAR IT COME

31:49.133 --> 31:50.633
OUT THAT SMOOTHLY IN EITHER

31:50.700 --> 31:51.433
TARANTINO MOVIES OR ONLINE

31:51.500 --> 31:52.500
FORUMS IN WHICH WHITE CHILDREN

31:52.566 --> 31:56.366
PLAY VIDEO GAMES TOGETHER.

31:56.433 --> 31:57.500
BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY

31:57.566 --> 31:58.066
CONCISE HISTORY OF A CERTAIN

31:58.133 --> 31:58.700
THREAD IN POLITICS FOR THE PAST

31:58.766 --> 31:59.533
HALF-CENTURY, WHICH BRINGS US

31:59.600 --> 32:01.833
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE PRESENT

32:01.900 --> 32:03.500
DAY -- LITERALLY, THE PRESENT

32:03.566 --> 32:06.166
WEDNESDAY, WHICH IS WHEN THE

32:06.233 --> 32:07.400
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

32:07.466 --> 32:12.033
IN ANNOUNCING A ROLLBACK OF

32:12.100 --> 32:12.766
AN OBAMA-ERA RULE UNDER THE

32:12.833 --> 32:13.666
FAIR HOUSING ACT, SENT A TWEET

32:13.733 --> 32:14.466
IN WHICH HE INFORMED ALL OF THE

32:14.533 --> 32:15.200
PEOPLE LIVING THEIR SUBURBAN

32:15.266 --> 32:16.233
LIFESTYLE DREAM THAT THEY WILL

32:16.300 --> 32:17.333
NO LONGER BE BOTHERED OR

32:17.400 --> 32:18.300
FINANCIALLY HURT BY HAVING

32:18.366 --> 32:19.466
LOW-INCOME HOUSING BUILT IN

32:19.533 --> 32:23.900
THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS.

32:23.966 --> 32:25.166
AND THAT IS BASICALLY A CAMPAIGN

32:25.233 --> 32:26.266
PROMISE CRAFTED BY LEE ATWATER

32:26.333 --> 32:27.400
AND DESIGNED TO WIN OVER THIS

32:27.466 --> 32:30.466
WOMAN WHO'S PROBABLY DEAD NOW.

32:30.533 --> 32:31.900
AND WHAT'S NOTABLE THERE IS NOT

32:31.966 --> 32:32.833
THAT TRUMP'S BEING RACIST --

32:32.900 --> 32:33.733
WHICH IS NOT REMOTELY

32:33.800 --> 32:35.566
SURPRISING.

32:35.633 --> 32:37.166
IT'S HOW NEATLY HE FITS INTO A

32:37.233 --> 32:38.366
SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT'S BEEN

32:38.433 --> 32:39.533
BAKED INTO THIS COUNTRY FROM THE

32:39.600 --> 32:41.300
BEGINNING AND WHICH WILL STILL

32:41.366 --> 32:43.366
BE HERE WHEN HE IS GONE.

32:43.433 --> 32:45.166
AND IF KIDS AREN'T TAUGHT THIS,

32:45.233 --> 32:46.400
WHAT CHANCE DO THEY HAVE TO

32:46.466 --> 32:47.500
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING

32:47.566 --> 32:48.833
RIGHT NOW?

32:48.900 --> 32:50.166
AND OBVIOUSLY, YOU'D NEED TO

32:50.233 --> 32:51.300
CALIBRATE THIS TO EACH AGE

32:51.366 --> 32:55.233
GROUP.

32:55.300 --> 32:56.833
NO ONE IS SUGGESTING PLAYING

32:56.900 --> 32:57.366
THAT LEE ATWATER TAPE TO

32:57.433 --> 32:58.100
THIRD-GRADERS.

32:58.166 --> 32:59.000
BUT IT'S A BIT LIKE SEX ED: YOU

32:59.066 --> 33:00.200
DON'T SKIP STRAIGHT AHEAD TO

33:00.266 --> 33:05.366
EJACULATION -- WHICH, BY THE

33:05.433 --> 33:06.833
WAY, IS A PRETTY GOOD SEX TIP

33:06.900 --> 33:08.066
FOR ANYONE WITH A PENIS -- BUT

33:08.133 --> 33:08.666
WE ALSO DON'T SPEND THE FIRST

33:08.733 --> 33:09.533
SEMESTER OF SEX ED TEACHING KIDS

33:09.600 --> 33:10.300
THAT WE WERE ALL DROPPED OUT OF

33:10.366 --> 33:11.400
THE SKY BY FUCKING STORKS,

33:11.466 --> 33:12.000
BECAUSE THEY'LL LATER HAVE TO

33:12.066 --> 33:13.966
UN-LEARN THAT.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.266
AND I KNOW THAT ADDRESSING

33:15.333 --> 33:16.533
MISTAKES LIKE THESE WON'T BE

33:16.600 --> 33:17.933
EASY.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.133
THERE'LL BE BAD-FAITH CHARGES

33:19.200 --> 33:20.666
THAT DOING SO IS POLITICAL --

33:20.733 --> 33:21.900
ALTHOUGH, I'D ARGUE, NO MORE

33:21.966 --> 33:22.900
POLITICAL THAN THE CHOICES WE'VE

33:23.000 --> 33:24.566
MADE TO TEACH HISTORY THE WAY WE

33:24.633 --> 33:27.966
DO NOW.

33:28.033 --> 33:28.966
AND NO DOUBT SOME PARENTS

33:29.033 --> 33:29.866
WILL INSTINCTIVELY RESIST THIS.

33:29.933 --> 33:31.233
BACK IN 2010, WHEN TEXAS WAS

33:31.300 --> 33:33.233
REVIEWING ITS STATE STANDARDS,

33:33.300 --> 33:34.433
ONE PARENT MADE IT VERY CLEAR

33:34.500 --> 33:35.866
THAT THE MAIN HISTORY HE WANTED

33:35.933 --> 33:38.233
HIS KIDS TAUGHT WAS THAT OF

33:38.300 --> 33:40.033
"AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM."

33:40.100 --> 33:43.900
>> THE ONE THING I WANT MY KIDS

33:43.966 --> 33:45.266
TO KNOW WHEN -- WHEN THEY

33:45.333 --> 33:46.200
GET OUT OF SCHOOL ABOUT AMERICA

33:46.266 --> 33:48.433
IS THAT THE WORST DAY IN AMERICA

33:48.500 --> 33:49.500
BEATS THE BEST DAY IN ANY OTHER

33:49.566 --> 33:53.166
COUNTRY.

33:53.233 --> 33:54.266
THAT FEELS --

33:54.333 --> 33:55.500
[APPLAUSE]

33:55.566 --> 33:57.000
THAT FEELS PRETTY EASY.

33:57.066 --> 33:58.400
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE BECOMES THIS

33:58.466 --> 34:00.100
GREAT FOCUS ON THE NEGATIVE

34:00.166 --> 34:02.066
HISTORY OF AMERICA INSTEAD OF

34:02.133 --> 34:03.900
SAYING -- OH, TAKE, FOR

34:03.966 --> 34:05.233
INSTANCE, SLAVERY -- INSTEAD OF,

34:05.300 --> 34:06.233
YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT IT IN A

34:06.300 --> 34:07.500
POSITIVE LIGHT THAT AMERICANS

34:07.566 --> 34:09.300
OVERCAME SOMETHING AS EVIL AS

34:09.366 --> 34:12.200
SLAVERY AND THAT WE'RE STILL A

34:12.266 --> 34:14.033
GREAT NATION TODAY SHOULD BE A

34:14.100 --> 34:15.233
TESTAMENT TO THE KIND OF

34:15.300 --> 34:17.166
AMERICAN SPIRIT THAT EXISTS IN

34:17.233 --> 34:19.566
THIS COUNTRY.

34:19.633 --> 34:21.233
>> John: OKAY, SO THERE'S A LOT

34:21.300 --> 34:22.000
TO UNPACK THERE.

34:22.066 --> 34:24.800
FIRST, YOUR WORST DAY IN AMERICA

34:24.866 --> 34:26.200
REALLY DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ARE,

34:26.266 --> 34:27.500
AND, IMPORTANTLY, WHEN YOU ARE.

34:27.566 --> 34:28.600
THERE'S A REASON, FOR INSTANCE,

34:28.666 --> 34:29.700
MARTY McFLY WAS WHITE.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.600
BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE DON'T

34:31.666 --> 34:33.000
GENERALLY HANG AROUND WITH

34:33.066 --> 34:35.866
JOHN C. CALHOUN LOOKALIKES WHO

34:35.933 --> 34:37.100
ARE OBSESSED WITH GOING BACK TO

34:37.166 --> 34:38.066
THE 1950s.

34:38.133 --> 34:39.466
AND SECOND, "AMERICANS" DID NOT

34:39.533 --> 34:40.066
OVERCOME SLAVERY.

34:40.133 --> 34:41.066
"CERTAIN" AMERICANS OVERCAME

34:41.133 --> 34:42.800
CERTAIN "OTHER" AMERICANS, AND

34:42.866 --> 34:44.100
SLAVERY WAS "ENDED," BUT WHETHER

34:44.166 --> 34:45.333
IT WAS "OVERCOME" IS VERY MUCH

34:45.400 --> 34:49.733
ANOTHER MATTER.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.066
AND, LOOK, WHILE I UNDERSTAND

34:51.133 --> 34:52.300
ANY PARENT WANTING HIS KIDS TO

34:52.366 --> 34:53.666
BE TAUGHT SOMETHING INSPIRING,

34:53.733 --> 34:54.300
WHAT HE'S ESSENTIALLY ASKING FOR

34:54.366 --> 34:54.866
THERE IS FOR HIS KIDS TO BE

34:54.933 --> 34:55.466
MISINFORMED.

34:55.533 --> 34:56.066
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO SERVE

34:56.133 --> 34:57.000
THEM WELL WHEN THEY GROW UP.

34:57.066 --> 34:57.733
IT'S NOT GOING TO SERVE ANY OF

34:57.800 --> 34:58.800
US WELL.

34:58.866 --> 34:59.900
BECAUSE IGNORING THE HISTORY YOU

34:59.966 --> 35:01.266
DON'T LIKE IS NOT A VICTIMLESS

35:01.333 --> 35:02.500
ACT.

35:02.566 --> 35:04.033
AND A HISTORY OF AMERICA THAT

35:04.100 --> 35:06.200
IGNORES WHITE SUPREMACY IS A

35:06.266 --> 35:07.833
WHITE SUPREMACIST'S HISTORY OF

35:07.900 --> 35:09.433
AMERICA, WHICH MATTERS, BECAUSE,

35:09.500 --> 35:11.200
WHILE IT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS,

35:11.266 --> 35:12.633
HISTORY ISN'T OVER -- IT'S STILL

35:12.700 --> 35:13.533
BEING WRITTEN.

35:13.600 --> 35:14.266
AND YOU KNOW WHO UNDERSTOOD

35:14.333 --> 35:15.300
THAT?

35:15.366 --> 35:22.233
JOHN LEWIS.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.533
HE IS SOMEONE WHO'S VERY MUCH

35:23.600 --> 35:24.533
PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY, AND HE

35:24.600 --> 35:25.900
KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF DRAWING A

35:25.966 --> 35:26.500
LINE FROM THE PAST THROUGH THE

35:26.566 --> 35:27.000
PRESENT.

35:27.066 --> 35:27.633
THAT MAY BE WHY ONE OF THE LAST

35:27.700 --> 35:28.433
THINGS HE DID BEFORE HE DIED WAS

35:28.500 --> 35:29.033
VISIT BLACK LIVES MATTER PLAZA

35:29.100 --> 35:29.866
IN WASHINGTON.

35:29.933 --> 35:30.933
HE EVEN WROTE AN OP-ED TO BE

35:31.000 --> 35:31.866
PUBLISHED POSTHUMOUSLY, WHICH

35:31.933 --> 35:33.366
SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO WHAT WE'VE

35:33.433 --> 35:35.166
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

35:35.233 --> 35:35.800
JUST LISTEN TO THIS EXTRACT,

35:35.866 --> 35:37.966
READ BY MORGAN FREEMAN:

35:38.033 --> 35:39.400
>> YOU MUST ALSO STUDY AND LEARN

35:39.466 --> 35:41.133
THE LESSONS OF HISTORY BECAUSE

35:41.200 --> 35:42.700
HUMANITY HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN

35:42.766 --> 35:45.200
THIS SOUL-WRENCHING, EXISTENTIAL

35:45.266 --> 35:47.533
STRUGGLE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.300
PEOPLE ON EVERY CONTINENT HAVE

35:49.366 --> 35:51.133
STOOD IN YOUR SHOES, THROUGH

35:51.200 --> 35:52.300
DECADES AND CENTURIES BEFORE

35:52.366 --> 35:54.866
YOU.

35:54.933 --> 35:57.566
THE TRUTH DOES NOT CHANGE, AND

35:57.633 --> 35:59.200
THAT IS WHY THE ANSWERS WORKED

35:59.266 --> 36:00.433
OUT LONG AGO CAN HELP YOU FIND

36:00.500 --> 36:02.133
SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES OF

36:02.200 --> 36:04.500
OUR TIME.

36:04.566 --> 36:06.133
>> John: EXACTLY.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.466
HISTORY, WHEN TAUGHT WELL, SHOWS

36:07.533 --> 36:08.866
US HOW TO IMPROVE THE WORLD.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.133
BUT HISTORY, WHEN TAUGHT POORLY,

36:10.200 --> 36:11.766
FALSELY CLAIMS THERE'S NOTHING

36:11.833 --> 36:13.600
TO IMPROVE.

36:13.666 --> 36:15.500
SO WE HAVE TO TEACH IT BETTER

36:15.566 --> 36:16.500
AND CONTINUE TO LEARN IT,

36:16.566 --> 36:17.766
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL

36:17.833 --> 36:19.433
OF US TO LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF

36:19.500 --> 36:23.300
HISTORY, WHETHER THEY ARE A CALL

36:23.366 --> 36:24.366
TO ACTION, TRULY HORRIFIC, OR A

36:24.433 --> 36:25.433
SAD MUMMY ORGASM.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.400
>> EH.

36:27.466 --> 36:28.433
>> John: STILL EXCELLENT.

36:28.500 --> 36:29.366
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

36:29.433 --> 36:32.966
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

36:33.033 --> 36:33.566
WE'RE OFF NEXT WEEK, BACK

36:33.633 --> 36:37.266
AUGUST 16TH.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.066
>> HI, STEVE GUTTENBERG AGAIN.

36:39.133 --> 36:40.466
WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW THINGS

36:40.533 --> 36:41.100
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GOOGLE TO FILL

36:41.166 --> 36:43.866
IN THOSE GAPS.

36:43.933 --> 36:45.466
CLAUDETTE COLEMAN, SHE'S

36:45.533 --> 36:46.133
AMAZING.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.333
THERE'S A WHOLE HISTORY THERE.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.933
JAMES BALDWIN.

36:50.000 --> 36:50.700
THERE'S A GREAT DOCUMENTARY.

36:50.766 --> 36:54.200
THE RED SUMMER OF 1919.

36:54.266 --> 36:56.300
DAVID WALKER'S APPEAL.

36:56.366 --> 36:57.366
THE BROWNSVILLE AFFAIR.

36:57.433 --> 36:58.733
THE ATLANTA WASHER WOMEN STRIKE.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.433
JUST GOOGLE THEM ALL.

37:00.500 --> 37:04.133
THAT WILL BE 150 BOOKS.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.200
I WAS IN "3 MAN AND A LITTLE
