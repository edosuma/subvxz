by this one painting.

50:56.148 --> 51:02.190
It is a young woman
who has been left to drown

51:02.273 --> 51:03.941
with her hands bound.

51:05.315 --> 51:09.857
And the painting
shows her peacefully having...

51:09.941 --> 51:11.691
given up...

51:11.774 --> 51:14.148
just under the surface
of the water.

51:15.232 --> 51:19.816
It just summed up
how I felt, you know,

51:19.899 --> 51:22.440
during the event
and sometimes after.

51:23.982 --> 51:26.232
You know,
this is what it feels like

51:26.315 --> 51:30.899
to have everything
taken from you.

51:30.982 --> 51:35.107
And yet, you know,
you're so close to the surface,

51:35.190 --> 51:37.399
but you can't survive.

MICHELLE: I think
the narcotic pull for me

52:24.524 --> 52:26.607
is what I think of
as the powerful absence

52:26.691 --> 52:28.691
that haunts an unsolved crime.

52:31.649 --> 52:34.524
Murderers lose their power
the moment we know them.

52:35.732 --> 52:40.065
But he, whomever he was,
was still out there.

52:40.148 --> 52:43.774
The hollow gap of his identity
was violently powerful to me.

52:45.941 --> 52:48.774
But if you commit
a brutal crime and then vanish,

52:49.732 --> 52:51.899
what you leave behind
isn't just pain,

52:51.982 --> 52:53.357
but absence...

52:54.107 --> 52:56.607
a great supreme blankness

52:56.691 --> 53:00.357
that triumphs,
obscenely, it seems to me...

53:01.399 --> 53:03.273

so much of her
personal writing and thoughts.

that I didn't know about,
