00:02.690 --> 00:04.560
How much doubt...

00:04.560 --> 00:06.150
is reasoNable?

00:06.150 --> 00:08.900
Well, folks...

00:08.900 --> 00:10.740
if I had To choose

00:10.740 --> 00:14.280
whether or not
to take someone's life...

00:14.280 --> 00:16.120
and that is the choice
Before you today,

00:16.120 --> 00:18.740
make no mistake...

00:18.740 --> 00:21.870
I don't think any amount
would seem reasonable.

00:21.870 --> 00:25.000
Now, me, I had to kill someone,

00:25.000 --> 00:28.040
I'd need it etched in gold
and signed by God Himself.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.800
So I ask...

00:32.630 --> 00:34.880
how much doubt
are you folks comfortable with?

00:38.010 --> 00:40.100
<i>He tells me a story...</i>

00:40.100 --> 00:44.230
<i>He says he's my son, Henry.
Adopted.</i>

00:44.230 --> 00:46.400
Did you start

00:46.400 --> 00:48.650
the fire in the hospital?

00:48.650 --> 00:51.360
<i>And then he starts in:
"I heard it, Dad."</i>

00:52.650 --> 00:54.700
We have to go.
To the woods.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.780
The schisma has been
getting louder again, Henry.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.620
<i>It hasn't risen to these levels</i>

00:58.620 --> 01:00.540
<i>in decades.</i>

01:00.540 --> 01:02.290
Do you hear it?

01:03.660 --> 01:04.830
We have to go...

01:04.830 --> 01:06.000
We have to go to the woods.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.330
Who are you?

01:07.330 --> 01:10.550
<i>The reason, the stain,</i>

01:10.550 --> 01:12.760
<i>the curse on our town,</i>

01:12.760 --> 01:15.130
<i>dragging evil behind you
everywhere you went.</i>

01:15.130 --> 01:17.090
<i>I was trying to get back.</i>

01:17.090 --> 01:19.850
<i>I couldn't.
Then Lacy found me.</i>

01:19.850 --> 01:22.350
<i>Took me to Shawshank.</i>

01:22.350 --> 01:24.020
<i>But after all these years...</i>

01:24.020 --> 01:26.560
<i>I still don't know
what you really are.</i>

01:26.560 --> 01:28.150
You believe me, don't you?

02:05.350 --> 02:07.480
Bless, O Lord,
this food to our purpose,

02:07.480 --> 02:09.729
and keep us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

02:09.729 --> 02:10.900
In Jesus' name, amen.

02:21.990 --> 02:24.990
They painted over
my parking spot today.

02:26.660 --> 02:28.540
Painted it blue.

02:39.970 --> 02:42.760
Little white man
in a wheelchair.

02:44.970 --> 02:47.310
I thought, "Well,
that's about right."

02:56.570 --> 02:59.610
I never had kids,
because of you.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.780
And waited on retirement.

03:01.780 --> 03:06.120
Waited... for instructions
from Him.

03:43.610 --> 03:44.780
Hmm.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.080
Why...

05:16.210 --> 05:18.670
why are you telling me?

05:18.670 --> 05:21.300
To you, we're strangers.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.510
But I've known you all my life.

05:24.510 --> 05:27.680
I need your help...

05:27.680 --> 05:29.970
to convince Henry
to go out there with me.

05:29.970 --> 05:32.890
Henry? Why Henry? He...

05:32.890 --> 05:34.640
Because he hears it, the sound.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.520
I think it's some kind of door

05:36.520 --> 05:38.730
from one world to the other.

05:38.730 --> 05:41.570
When I went back out there,
nothing happened.

05:41.570 --> 05:44.780
I didn't even know
what to look for.

05:44.780 --> 05:48.660
How... How do you know
that it's even there at all?

05:48.660 --> 05:49.990
It has to be.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.910
You believe me, don't you?

05:56.160 --> 05:57.960
I want to, and...

05:59.920 --> 06:02.130
I just...

06:02.130 --> 06:05.380
Bring Henry
to Harmony Hill.

06:05.380 --> 06:07.630
There's something
I want to remind him of.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.600
Wait. I...

06:15.640 --> 06:18.900
What was I like...
over there?

06:22.650 --> 06:24.230
Happier.

06:44.130 --> 06:45.380
<i>This is
Henry Deaver.</i>

06:45.380 --> 06:46.760
<i>I'm away from my phone,</i>

06:46.760 --> 06:48.420
<i>please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

06:48.420 --> 06:50.220
<i>Henry, I got your text.</i>

06:50.220 --> 06:52.550
<i>I'm sorry, I haven't
seen your mom.</i>

06:52.550 --> 06:54.180
<i>I hope she's OK. But...</i>

06:54.180 --> 06:56.180
<i>But I really need
to talk to you.</i>

06:56.180 --> 06:58.600
<i>Call me as soon as you can.</i>

07:49.150 --> 07:51.030
What the fuck?

08:05.670 --> 08:06.880
Ruth!

08:08.630 --> 08:10.760
It's me! It's Molly.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.640
Why don't you
come down from there?

08:14.640 --> 08:19.390
No, dear. I would, but I've got
to get to the hospital.

08:19.390 --> 08:23.310
You see, I love Alan Pangborn,

08:23.310 --> 08:27.480
so I'll stay at the hospital
three extra days this time,

08:27.480 --> 08:29.360
and Alan won't leave my side.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.530
How 'bout that?

08:34.860 --> 08:36.620
Ruth, please.

08:36.620 --> 08:39.120
Oh, gosh. Please come down.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.159
Ruth, Alan's dead.

08:42.830 --> 08:45.330
I know that.

08:45.330 --> 08:46.790
I'm the one who shot him.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.550
But he's also alive...

08:50.550 --> 08:52.090
other times.

08:53.220 --> 08:55.630
It's just zigs and zags,

08:55.630 --> 08:57.640
forks in the river,

08:57.640 --> 09:00.390
always changing,
always the same.

09:00.390 --> 09:02.850
Alan's dead, Alan's alive...

09:04.890 --> 09:08.230
Been here before, be here again.

09:08.230 --> 09:10.400
You and me on the bridge.

09:11.570 --> 09:13.400
Ruth, please.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.030
Let's just go home.

09:15.030 --> 09:18.450
Oh, you always say that.

09:18.450 --> 09:19.990
Every time.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.450
One...

09:25.160 --> 09:27.880
One of those other times...

09:30.840 --> 09:32.920
you left Matthew.

09:34.130 --> 09:35.550
You went away.

09:35.550 --> 09:36.840
With Alan.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.840
You already had a bag packed.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.390
First time you've said that.

09:51.020 --> 09:53.230
Ruth, please.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.580
Tonight's discharges.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.710
Next chain's out tomorrow.

10:06.710 --> 10:08.710
Augusta State, 0800.

10:08.710 --> 10:11.210
Hundred-fifty-two
less mouths to feed.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.340
Uh, what about
Bolduc Correctional?

10:17.340 --> 10:19.180
They're draggin'
their ass on their intake,

10:19.180 --> 10:21.180
so I'll keep pushin'.
But nobody seems to give a damn

10:21.180 --> 10:22.850
we got a deadline
to clear this place out.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.220
<i>The search is focusing</i>

10:24.220 --> 10:26.140
<i>on a wide stretch
of Castle Woods</i>

10:26.140 --> 10:27.850
<i>near the suspect's
last known location.</i>

10:27.850 --> 10:29.600
Shawshank's
been open a hundred years.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.900
One head case goes postal,
nine of my men are dead...

10:33.900 --> 10:36.490
an institution dies with 'em.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.390
You hear it now?

12:32.980 --> 12:35.650
- It's that way.
- False witness.

12:42.110 --> 12:44.240
I know you don't hear it.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.070
And I know why you don't.

12:46.070 --> 12:49.120
You see, I figured out
the problem, Henry.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.120
She's the problem.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.960
She's forced you to deceive me

12:52.960 --> 12:54.710
- No, sir...
- the way that she's deceived me

12:54.710 --> 12:57.500
for the last year
with the Sheriff.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.500
She lies with another man,

12:59.500 --> 13:03.090
and that's a sin
in the eyes of the Lord.

13:03.090 --> 13:05.430
But soon your mother
will be called home,

13:05.430 --> 13:08.260
and when she's gone,
we will live pure,

13:08.260 --> 13:11.100
just the two of us,
in the cathedral of His voice.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.430
Gone where?

13:15.730 --> 13:18.810
"For the wages of sin...
is death."

13:21.900 --> 13:23.990
- Romans.
- Romans.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.490
6:23.

13:25.490 --> 13:27.490
That's a father's son.

13:27.490 --> 13:29.160
What are you gonna do?

13:33.410 --> 13:35.000
She's left me no choice.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.460
No.

13:38.460 --> 13:39.790
Henry.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.510
Henry!

14:10.950 --> 14:13.080
Hey.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.700
You OK, man?

14:21.340 --> 14:23.670
Dude...

14:23.670 --> 14:26.920
this shit's happening
all over town.

14:28.340 --> 14:30.340
Global warming, right?

15:34.160 --> 15:35.660
What the hell?

15:57.180 --> 16:00.310
<i>Front door open.</i>

16:00.310 --> 16:02.440
<i>And now
privately owned Shawshank...</i>

16:02.440 --> 16:04.610
- Mom.
- <i>will be closing its doors...</i>

16:04.610 --> 16:06.060
Where's the Queen?

16:13.610 --> 16:15.410
Henry.

16:15.410 --> 16:17.620
<i>Long history
of suicide and corruption...</i>

16:17.620 --> 16:19.700
- I just talked to Jackie.
- Wh...

16:19.700 --> 16:22.620
- Are you OK?
- What are you doing here?

16:25.670 --> 16:27.210
I'll put this
with the pepper, huh?

16:36.720 --> 16:40.220
Um... I found her
out on the bridge.

16:40.220 --> 16:41.560
She was gonna jump again.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.940
Jesus.

16:48.940 --> 16:51.820
Henry, you got stabbed.

16:51.820 --> 16:52.780
Henry, what...

16:55.160 --> 16:57.320
I don't know what's happening.

17:00.490 --> 17:02.200
He came to me, Henry.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.079
Who?

17:23.640 --> 17:27.900
<i>Warden Lacy,
Zalewski, Juniper Hill, Alan...</i>

17:29.270 --> 17:30.860
terrible things just...

17:30.860 --> 17:32.780
just follow him
wherever he goes,

17:32.780 --> 17:35.200
like he's a magnet or something.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.990
And he's saying

17:38.990 --> 17:42.410
it was the same for you
over there.

17:42.410 --> 17:43.540
Over there.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.420
He knew everything, Henry.

17:49.420 --> 17:53.760
About me, about you,
your family...

17:53.760 --> 17:55.340
He was in the shed for two days,

17:55.340 --> 17:57.630
looking through
all that old stuff.

17:57.630 --> 17:59.760
Studying the albums,
memorizing the tapes.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.810
All he wants is for you
to help him get home.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.220
To go out to the woods with him.

18:03.220 --> 18:04.520
Yes.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.100
He thinks that the door is...

18:07.100 --> 18:08.350
the...

18:10.230 --> 18:12.900
The door or...

18:12.900 --> 18:15.740
whatever it is...

18:15.740 --> 18:17.400
he thinks it's open right now

18:17.400 --> 18:19.990
and he doesn't know
how long it will stay open for.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.120
We need to turn him in, Molly.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.250
Where am I supposed to meet him?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.210
You're not gonna help him.

18:37.630 --> 18:39.840
My dad took me out to the woods
chasing after a sound,

18:39.840 --> 18:41.300
and he ended up dead.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.560
Now, let's say
I do believe this.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.640
Now you're saying
that <i>you</i> went out there

18:46.640 --> 18:48.850
and you ended up dead too,
so either way,

18:48.850 --> 18:50.810
someone always ends up dead.

18:52.690 --> 18:55.480
- Henry.
- Where is he, Molly?

18:59.660 --> 19:01.570
<i>Hello?</i>

19:01.570 --> 19:04.410
<i>No. No.</i>

19:21.340 --> 19:22.760
- Wendell.
- Dad.

19:29.730 --> 19:32.940
Why did you get off that bus?
What were you thinking?

19:32.940 --> 19:33.900
Huh?

19:35.860 --> 19:38.190
It was the sound.

19:38.190 --> 19:39.990
- What?
- There's a sound

19:39.990 --> 19:41.200
out there in the woods, Dad.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.820
It's like a... hum.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.950
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.660
I <i>couldn't</i> stay on the bus.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.290
I had to get closer.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.210
Let's go.

19:56.210 --> 19:59.300
Mr. Deaver. A word.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.420
- You can call me.
- You're not goin'

20:00.420 --> 20:01.840
anywhere this time.

20:04.180 --> 20:05.220
Dad.

20:06.760 --> 20:07.760
Give us a second.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.680
Wait for me out there.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.730
It's OK.

20:17.820 --> 20:19.900
You know this man, don't you?

20:22.200 --> 20:24.110
He's dead.

20:24.110 --> 20:26.240
Eyewitness says that
you and Mr. Branch

20:26.240 --> 20:28.540
had an argument
a few nights ago.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.620
So here we are again.

20:39.090 --> 20:40.960
Where is he?

20:42.800 --> 20:43.970
Who?

20:45.340 --> 20:46.430
You let him stay here

20:46.430 --> 20:47.640
after we released him.

20:49.180 --> 20:51.310
Oh. Um...

20:51.310 --> 20:52.600
but he's not here.

21:04.820 --> 21:06.870
Warden Lacy was right.

21:06.870 --> 21:08.700
He's the fucking devil.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.630
Hey. Are you... OK?

21:18.630 --> 21:21.800
Do you need to come inside
and...

21:21.800 --> 21:24.470
sit down or something?

21:32.930 --> 21:33.770
Oh!

21:37.810 --> 21:39.190
Your fingerprints

21:39.190 --> 21:41.190
were found in the RV,
and your DNA,

21:41.190 --> 21:42.530
you were in the woods
late at night,

21:42.530 --> 21:44.690
you fled the scene of a crime.

21:44.690 --> 21:46.240
Friend of your father.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.990
The bed &amp; Breakfast,
breaking and entering.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.830
Wherever you go,
there's bloodshed.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.550
People have always had questions
about you.

22:04.550 --> 22:07.510
Questions that
never got answered.

22:07.510 --> 22:09.760
And you come waltzing
back to town,

22:09.760 --> 22:11.760
and there's more questions
than ever.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.060
You're a lawyer.

22:16.060 --> 22:18.350
Why wait for another one?

22:29.780 --> 22:31.370
Phone call.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.420
<i>Two hours!</i>

22:45.420 --> 22:47.380
<i>We been here so long!</i>

22:52.510 --> 22:55.850
Ma'am, you said she just
walked across the street?

22:55.850 --> 22:57.430
Hey, knock it off!

22:57.430 --> 22:59.900
Knock it off. Get down!

22:59.900 --> 23:01.520
Natives are gettin'
restless in here.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.650
I can't leave 'em
on the bus all day.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.690
What the hell
do you expect us to do?

23:05.690 --> 23:06.780
Jesus.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.370
Hello?

23:23.380 --> 23:25.050
You think he left it for Porter?

23:27.260 --> 23:32.140
It's exactly like the one
he left in my office.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.800
I don't know what
to believe about him anymore.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.270
Molly, I need a favor.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.980
A big one.

23:44.730 --> 23:47.320
I need you to take Wendell
to Boston.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.150
- To his mother.
- OK.

23:50.150 --> 23:52.490
And from there,
just keep drivin'.

23:52.490 --> 23:54.410
Start over. Somewhere warm.

23:54.410 --> 23:56.700
Virginia. Mexico.

23:58.330 --> 24:00.120
Just...

24:00.120 --> 24:01.460
get away from Castle Rock.

24:01.460 --> 24:02.580
From all this.

24:05.380 --> 24:06.960
From me.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.050
You don't even live here.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.890
Yeah, well, it looks like
I'm gonna be...

24:17.890 --> 24:19.560
stayin' here a little longer.

24:19.560 --> 24:23.310
They can't possibly believe...

24:23.310 --> 24:25.940
People around here believe
all sorts of things about me.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.150
Time's up.

24:43.330 --> 24:45.330
Harmony Hill.

24:45.330 --> 24:47.000
The cemetery.

26:21.550 --> 26:22.930
Hands up!

26:41.870 --> 26:43.910
Your dad didn't do anything.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.330
You know that, right?

26:48.210 --> 26:49.580
I guess.

26:53.750 --> 26:57.840
This town is fucked up.
Always has been.

27:00.470 --> 27:02.600
Does it have something
to do with the sound...

27:04.390 --> 27:06.140
whatever's in the woods?

27:54.940 --> 27:56.730
You sent them.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.570
I understand.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.200
It's what I would have done.

28:06.910 --> 28:09.200
She told you...

28:09.200 --> 28:10.960
everything?

28:16.500 --> 28:19.300
I don't know how much
time we have left.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.550
If the sound stops...

28:26.390 --> 28:29.470
I think I could be stuck here.

28:29.470 --> 28:33.020
As long as I'm here,
things will get worse.

28:33.020 --> 28:35.270
People will die.

28:35.270 --> 28:36.730
I can't stop it.

28:39.190 --> 28:41.570
I'm not supposed to be here.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.490
And you didn't
want any of this?

28:57.250 --> 28:58.880
Who are you?

29:02.220 --> 29:03.970
Same as you...

29:06.220 --> 29:07.390
a victim.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.600
Mm-mm. No.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.100
I don't believe you.

29:15.310 --> 29:17.020
What about the dream?

29:19.440 --> 29:24.360
You're in a basement...
or locked in a cage.

30:09.370 --> 30:11.450
It makes sense that
you don't remember.

30:17.420 --> 30:19.790
Think about what you
went through in that cage.

30:21.590 --> 30:25.590
When they found me,
even after I got out,

30:25.590 --> 30:27.340
it didn't all fit together.

30:32.260 --> 30:34.180
But then I got to your house...

30:37.230 --> 30:38.480
my house.

30:40.810 --> 30:43.230
Your memories
will come back, too.

30:44.860 --> 30:48.490
Maybe in pieces...
one at a time.

30:50.700 --> 30:51.820
They will.

31:05.090 --> 31:09.130
If my mom had stayed
in Castle Rock with my dad...

31:10.300 --> 31:12.220
in your world, I mean...

31:13.640 --> 31:15.260
what would have happened?

31:19.310 --> 31:20.850
It would have killed her.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.280
He knew all about Alan and Mom.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.900
She told me after we left.

31:28.900 --> 31:32.280
Romans 6:23.

31:32.280 --> 31:34.120
"The wages of sin is..."

31:34.120 --> 31:35.240
Death.

31:42.670 --> 31:45.500
I have no idea
what my son said, dear,

31:45.500 --> 31:47.960
but I'm not one
much for coddlin'.

31:55.390 --> 31:56.720
G'night, Mrs. Deaver.

32:17.790 --> 32:19.500
<i>But soon your mother
will be called home,</i>

32:19.500 --> 32:21.080
<i>and when she's gone,</i>

32:21.080 --> 32:22.790
<i>we will live pure,
just the two of us,</i>

32:22.790 --> 32:24.330
<i>in the cathedral of His voice.</i>

32:24.330 --> 32:26.630
<i>"For the wages of sin is death."</i>

32:32.970 --> 32:35.760
Move to the back of the cell...

32:35.760 --> 32:36.720
both of you.

32:45.690 --> 32:46.690
Let's go.

32:50.110 --> 32:51.650
Stop.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.490
Get in.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.670
Bring 'em in!

33:14.090 --> 33:15.890
Whaddya think?

33:22.980 --> 33:26.600
The fuck?
It's him! Nic Cage!

33:28.150 --> 33:29.940
Nic fuckin' Cage!

33:32.320 --> 33:34.280
National fuckin' treasure.

34:09.230 --> 34:11.150
Little punk bitch.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.989
We're gonna turn you out, boy.

34:13.989 --> 34:15.610
Come on, Nicky.
Come lap it up, huh?

34:15.610 --> 34:17.150
Whose bitch are you now, huh?

34:19.949 --> 34:21.530
He don't look
so fuckin' tough to me.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.540
- Fuck off!
- Shut up!

34:23.540 --> 34:25.500
Hey!

34:25.500 --> 34:27.040
- Coyne was a fuckin'
piece of shit.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.580
I wish he died slower.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.130
- Wanted to make you
his bitch, didn't he?

34:30.130 --> 34:31.590
- How 'bout I make you
mine right now?

34:31.590 --> 34:33.420
- Big words for a guy
with such a little dick!

34:33.420 --> 34:36.550
- Staring at me in the shower
again? You fuckin' faggot.

34:36.550 --> 34:40.300
Separate 'em!

34:40.300 --> 34:42.889
I'll pay up.
I'll pay up when you suck my...

34:42.889 --> 34:45.310
Back up!

34:45.310 --> 34:48.190
- Back up! Face the wall!
- Show me the weapon.

34:48.190 --> 34:49.400
I'm fuckin' bleeding!

34:49.400 --> 34:51.400
Show me the shank, asshole.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.980
Step back!

34:53.980 --> 34:57.450
All right, settle down.
Let's take a look.

34:57.450 --> 34:59.820
Hands on the wall! Now!

35:06.000 --> 35:08.500
Show me your hands.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.920
Shit. Somebody
get a medic in here...

35:16.880 --> 35:19.090
Come on! Come on! Keys!

36:05.640 --> 36:07.010
Come on.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.830
<i>All units, all units,</i>

36:32.830 --> 36:35.460
<i>please respond,
please respond...</i>

36:40.880 --> 36:42.880
Don't. Don't.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.180
Don't.

36:48.220 --> 36:50.390
Don't... Don't go out there.

36:52.390 --> 36:54.190
It's...

36:54.190 --> 36:56.610
it's sss...

36:58.820 --> 37:01.690
Henry. We need to leave.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.490
No.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.580
Now.

37:14.540 --> 37:16.380
You did this?

37:23.670 --> 37:25.840
Get up.

38:08.140 --> 38:10.180
When we get there,

38:10.180 --> 38:12.560
you'll see that it's all true.

38:14.230 --> 38:15.890
I don't want to hurt you, Henry.

38:15.890 --> 38:17.350
<i>Henry,</i>

38:17.350 --> 38:18.560
I don't want to hurt you!

38:20.480 --> 38:22.530
<i>Where'd you go, son?</i>

38:24.190 --> 38:25.610
<i>Henry?</i>

38:27.570 --> 38:28.740
Where'd you go, son?

38:30.200 --> 38:31.530
Henry, where'd you go?

39:23.790 --> 39:25.550
<i>Henry, where'd you go?</i>

39:30.680 --> 39:32.430
Henry, where'd you go?

39:38.180 --> 39:39.810
Where'd you go, son?

39:44.860 --> 39:46.900
Henry, I don't want to hurt you, son.

40:23.900 --> 40:25.610
Aah!

40:45.330 --> 40:47.170
Is it louder?

41:33.630 --> 41:37.220
<i>Truth doesn't change;
It's just truth. Pure.</i>

41:37.220 --> 41:40.140
<i>But justice?
Well, that looks different,</i>

41:40.140 --> 41:42.730
<i>depending on what side of that
invisible line you're on.</i>

41:42.730 --> 41:43.740
And Ron...

41:45.730 --> 41:48.900
the line is here.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.650
See?

41:50.650 --> 41:53.530
Runs right through
Wilma Jurzik's azaleas.

41:53.530 --> 41:55.240
You dug your septic here.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.910
Now, Maine property law
is a briar patch,

42:00.910 --> 42:04.540
but... I got some tricks
up my sleeve.

42:13.550 --> 42:15.470
Dad.

42:15.470 --> 42:17.510
Hey!

42:17.510 --> 42:19.260
- You're early!
- Yeah.

42:21.510 --> 42:23.100
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

42:32.820 --> 42:34.110
Check.

42:38.450 --> 42:39.870
Take your time.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.420
<i>Some folks get away...</i>

43:02.640 --> 43:04.140
<i>spend the rest of their lives</i>

43:04.140 --> 43:06.350
<i>trying to forget this place.</i>

43:06.350 --> 43:08.890
<i>Any real estate agent</i>

43:08.890 --> 43:11.480
<i>can refer listing after listing.</i>

43:11.480 --> 43:15.820
<i>My goal is to help people
stay in their own neighborhood.</i>

43:15.820 --> 43:18.070
See you tomorrow, Grandma.

43:23.450 --> 43:25.950
<i>Maybe they do forget...
for a while.</i>

43:37.550 --> 43:40.840
<i>Some never leave,
no matter how hard they try.</i>

43:52.440 --> 43:55.860
<i>Most of us are trapped here
for a reason.</i>

44:05.780 --> 44:10.120
<i>Everyone in this town
has some sin or regret...</i>

44:11.870 --> 44:14.670
<i>some cage of his own making.</i>

44:16.670 --> 44:20.050
<i>And a story, a sad one,</i>

44:20.050 --> 44:22.380
<i>about how we got this way.</i>

44:27.100 --> 44:29.640
<i>"It wasn't me,
it was this place."</i>

44:30.890 --> 44:33.730
<i>That's what we say.</i>

44:33.730 --> 44:37.610
<i>But that's a story, too.
It doesn't change a thing.</i>

44:40.820 --> 44:43.910
<i>Maybe something
turned you into a monster.</i>

44:46.700 --> 44:49.240
<i>Or maybe you were one all along.</i>

45:04.130 --> 45:07.050
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

45:07.050 --> 45:10.770
<i>You're here now...
this is who you are.</i>

45:12.310 --> 45:14.650
<i>This is where you live.</i>

45:16.940 --> 45:19.020
<i>This is where you're from.</i>

46:25.630 --> 46:26.930
What is this?

46:35.680 --> 46:37.440
Christmas present.

46:40.480 --> 46:43.440
- It's Christmas?
- Tomorrow.

46:57.660 --> 47:00.000
I know you still
have doubts, Henry.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.100
How long are we gonna do this?

47:20.690 --> 47:22.190
Don't know.

47:25.980 --> 47:28.650
After a while, you forget...

47:32.950 --> 47:35.950
which side of the bars
you're on.

47:44.340 --> 47:47.090
That's what Warden Lacy
used to say.

47:50.380 --> 47:52.140
Merry Christmas.

48:01.140 --> 48:03.560
Look how things
turned out for him.

49:12.300 --> 49:15.050
"The axe felt right in my hand.

49:15.050 --> 49:17.300
But let me tell you,

49:17.300 --> 49:20.890
when I heard the pop of a skull
giving up its secrets,

49:20.890 --> 49:24.520
felt the root and stem
of a cleft brain

49:24.520 --> 49:26.480
stopping the blade,

49:26.480 --> 49:31.030
I realized where that axe
really belonged...

49:31.030 --> 49:34.200
dead center
of the good professor's head."

49:36.530 --> 49:38.490
What, it's like
a horror whatever?

49:40.580 --> 49:44.580
- That's pretty reductive.
- I don't get the title.

49:44.580 --> 49:47.330
"Overlooked."
Who's overlooked?

49:48.630 --> 49:50.550
Backstory.

49:50.550 --> 49:53.340
You know? Ancient history.

49:53.340 --> 49:55.010
It's family history.

49:57.340 --> 50:01.060
I'm actually headed out west
on a research trip next month.

50:01.060 --> 50:05.020
Best place to finish a book
is where it started.

50:05.020 --> 50:07.520
I read that somewhere.

51:37.190 --> 51:38.450
