I'm only part alien,

ALEX:
You are gonna let
all of these people die,

00:12.470 --> 00:14.139
and you are gonna let
the aliens take the blame.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.224

MAX:
What kind of work are you doing?

I am asking you
to trust me with this.

MAX:
I have a family to protect.

You could've stopped Diego

a year of my work!

00:24.065 --> 00:25.108

Things are coming back to me.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.110
Little flashes.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.987
I know so little
about my own story.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.072
The parts that I thought
I understood

00:31.114 --> 00:32.073
are unraveling.

Howdy... partner.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.834
Don't move.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.212
Well, we can keep this cordial.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.173
We're the same.
Why-why are we the same?

00:49.174 --> 00:50.216
Listen, son...

00:50.258 --> 00:51.551
I'm not your son.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.888
Right?

00:54.929 --> 00:56.264

Round here,

01:08.860 --> 01:10.278
I go by Jones.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.824
Oh, your mothers never told
you about me?

01:16.326 --> 01:18.078
Can't say
that doesn't smart a bit.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.412
Why don't I show you?

No, stop!

01:36.888 --> 01:39.557
Max. What did he do to you?

01:41.518 --> 01:43.645
He, uh...

01:43.686 --> 01:47.357
he told me that he's the Savior

created a proprietary code

04:50.832 --> 04:52.792
We knew it showed promise
for other applications.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.377
Yeah, but that gives them an
exclusive lease on the patent,

04:54.419 --> 04:55.586

how they muted alien powers

06:45.279 --> 06:46.572
in Caulfield Prison,

06:46.614 --> 06:48.825
but it's kind of hard
engineering a cage

09:59.599 --> 10:01.434
Uh, Steph took me to Alvarado's.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.352
Mm! I hear it's got
a great view of the city.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.271
I think she hoped the view

10:05.313 --> 10:06.981
would soften the blow
of the breakup.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.277
I can't blame her.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.487
Y-You invented a cure
that miraculously saved her life

10:13.529 --> 10:15.114
at the one-yard line

10:15.156 --> 10:16.949
and now she doesn't want
to be tied to Roswell.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.117
Why do you have
to be tied to Roswell?

10:20.369 --> 10:24.081
Actually, a position opened
at my old hospital in New York.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.249
You can get your job back?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.959
Promotion.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.753
So you're curious
what your next step is.

10:28.794 --> 10:32.381
I am curious where
I actually set up my life.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.508
I mean, isn't that why you
moved here to Los Angeles?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.347
I mean...
you must love the beaches.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.806
I love it.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.976
Liz?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.978
Have you seriously not been
to the beach?

10:46.020 --> 10:48.522
You had pictures
of the ocean

10:48.564 --> 10:50.608
in your locker,
come on!

10:50.650 --> 10:52.151
I know you're trying
to save the world.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.819
Right now, I would
just settle for saving

10:53.861 --> 10:55.988
Maria's mind from degenerating
every time she has a vision.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.618
But I'm stuck
trying to replicate

11:00.660 --> 11:02.203
what I did with Steph
without my notes or tapes

11:02.244 --> 11:03.954
or antibodies
from Noah's choroid plexus

11:03.996 --> 11:05.915
because Max Evans roasted them.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.627
You weren't gonna solve a global
pandemic with Noah's corpse.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
You don't know that.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.798
Why are you defending Max right
now? You got to be Team Liz!

11:13.839 --> 11:16.133
Team Liz!
As the founding member
of Team Liz,

11:16.175 --> 11:18.219
I got to tell you,
you seem unhappy.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.262
I just can't believe
it's been a whole year.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.556
Max hasn't come for you.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.356
Have you even gone
on a date?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.649
I have, yes.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.526
Mm-hmm. How many second dates?

11:33.567 --> 11:35.778
Because my guess

11:35.820 --> 11:37.363
is there's
a lot more petri dishes

11:37.405 --> 11:38.030
that have shared Chardonnay
with you than suitors.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.911
Is it really fair to some
new guy if I keep looking

11:43.953 --> 11:46.080
over my shoulder hoping
that Max is gonna show up?

11:47.289 --> 11:48.582
(sighs)

11:48.624 --> 11:50.126
He's not coming, Liz.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.879
I know that's
tough to hear,

11:53.921 --> 11:55.756
but if you've got your life
on hold for him...

11:57.341 --> 11:58.718
He's moved on.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.431
Like, you have to do things
that make you feel alive

12:03.472 --> 12:04.807
if you're gonna kill it
at work, you know that.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.476
Remember who you are.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.186
You are Liz Ortecho.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.188
You don't just
accept things that suck.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.484
You change them.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.699
MARIA:
Wow, a '65 Mustang

12:21.741 --> 12:23.284
with a Windsor HiPo V8.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.577
I cannot believe it.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.537
I bought it off an
old drag racing buddy

12:26.579 --> 12:27.872
a couple months ago.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.957
(laughs)
You used to drag race?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.542
Is that really so hard
to believe?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.044
Uh, for Guerin, no.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.464
For the sweet, one-beer-a-night,
second grade teacher?

12:36.505 --> 12:38.382
Uh, yeah.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.177
Well, sorry to break it to
you, but your ex doesn't own

12:41.218 --> 12:42.636
the rights to troubled
and self-destructive.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.513
Okay, why don't
you tell him that?

12:46.015 --> 12:47.767
You guys are good, right?

12:47.808 --> 12:50.269
Some things are just
not meant to be.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.648
And how do you know
when they are?

13:03.073 --> 13:04.992
So you got any moves
with this baby?

13:07.119 --> 13:09.038
(Maria whoops)

13:09.079 --> 13:11.123

That too much?

13:11.165 --> 13:12.333
No way. (whoops)

13:28.265 --> 13:29.850
Are you okay?
I don't know.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.310
I saw this coffin

13:31.352 --> 13:32.812
and I think someone's gonna die.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.448

14:05.302 --> 14:07.429
Hey, Manes.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.057
Hey, I didn't expect you
to meet me.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.351
I wasn't exactly at war.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.648
Look, there's, uh, something
I need to talk to you about.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.358
It's kind of urgent.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.943
How urgent?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.361
Men have needs, you know?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.113
And I've kind of
been off at war, so...

14:38.544 --> 14:40.379
(phone ringing)

14:46.302 --> 14:48.846
Qué susto.
You look like La Llorona.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.848
I was up all night
waging a one-woman war

14:50.890 --> 14:51.891
against corporate America.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.684
Mm.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.519
What's wrong?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.687
Uh, nothing.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.272
Today is my first day
of art therapy.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.316
What happened
to the last therapist?

15:00.357 --> 15:03.485
Talk therapy doesn't exactly
work for bipolar disorder

15:03.527 --> 15:05.446
when you're covering up
an alien resurrection.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.323
But that's not

15:07.364 --> 15:08.824
why I'm calling.
I'm actually calling about Mom.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.618
No.

15:10.659 --> 15:13.203
She sent a package

15:13.245 --> 15:15.205
with all of her plans
from last year

15:15.247 --> 15:16.957
to take down Jesse Manes.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.710
This letter asking
for forgiveness.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.003
And...

15:22.671 --> 15:23.881
...butyricol.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.424
(sighs)

15:25.466 --> 15:27.301
That's the drug she used
to erase Jenna Cameron's

15:27.343 --> 15:28.552
memory of her.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.637
I'll deal with it
when I'm home next.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.724
Do you think by then
you'll, like, have a real couch?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.895
I'm working on it.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.942
This was your brain
four months ago.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.487
Notice your right temporal lobe?

15:47.696 --> 15:49.323
The dark parts are growing.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.659
Every vision steals
a little more from you.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.661
If you don't put back on
your protective bracelet

15:53.702 --> 15:54.870
you could be--

15:54.912 --> 15:56.664
Unable
to recognize faces?

15:56.705 --> 15:59.124
Forgetting where I am,
and wandering like my mom?

15:59.166 --> 16:02.711
Whoa, but there's a difference
between you and her.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.255
You can stop this.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.340
Okay, I came in
and I got the scans

16:06.382 --> 16:07.716
after my visions
just like you said.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.843
Why are you fighting me on this?
Because...

16:09.885 --> 16:11.762
last night...

16:11.804 --> 16:13.639
I saw a funeral.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.893
(short laugh)

16:17.935 --> 16:19.937
Whatever you're here to ask me,

16:19.979 --> 16:21.730
you already know
it's a bad idea.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.148
Why am I having
these visions

16:23.190 --> 16:24.692
if I'm not supposed
to do anything

16:24.733 --> 16:25.985
about them?
I don't know.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.528
But I do know that
people die all the time.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.654
It's gonna happen
whether you know

16:28.696 --> 16:30.072
who's in that
coffin or not.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.157
What I can keep from
ending poorly is your life.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.952
Please...

16:34.994 --> 16:36.745
reconsider the bracelet.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.125

16:45.754 --> 16:47.756
Do I have competition?

16:47.798 --> 16:49.633

No.

It's my brother and Maria

16:52.761 --> 16:54.972

16:55.014 --> 16:56.473

Our patent was leaked.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.112
Hey.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.781
Where's your shock?

22:04.823 --> 22:06.533
This was, like,
eight months of our lives,

22:06.575 --> 22:09.369
and you're not exactly
the calm one here in the du...

22:15.334 --> 22:17.377
What did you do, Roswell?

22:24.760 --> 22:26.386
All right, Genoryx owns
your-your computer,

22:26.428 --> 22:27.763
your phone,
your apartment building

22:27.804 --> 22:32.309
and your I.P.,
so if it's you,

22:32.351 --> 22:33.935
you're toast.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.146
Let's just say for, like,
one moment, that it's me.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.399
Oh.
And... then what?

22:42.652 --> 22:44.821
I have a buddy
in the tech field.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.281
He wants me
to consult

22:46.323 --> 22:47.699
on a DNA sequence
for a security system.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.451
If I agree, I bet
that he could cook up

22:49.493 --> 22:51.453
some sort of
computer worm to maybe...

22:51.495 --> 22:53.538
No. No, no, no. I don't
want you to call in

22:53.580 --> 22:54.915
such a huge favor for me.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.458
Well, good,
because it's not for you.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.296
I got into genetics

23:01.338 --> 23:02.839
because my mother's
early-onset Alzheimer's

23:02.881 --> 23:04.424
made me in an orphan
when I was nine.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.511
I've spent
my entire adult life

23:07.552 --> 23:09.388
trying to make
her suffering worth it.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.432
I can't lose this neurostudy.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.683
Genoryx will not
take away our grant

23:13.725 --> 23:15.060
just because
they lost some money.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.061
That would be
a publicity nightmare.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.397
You're right, they can't.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.607
But they can fire you,
for cause...

23:20.649 --> 23:22.651
(sighs)

23:24.152 --> 23:25.529
...and me right along with you.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.076
I can't approve
your anger management hours

23:31.118 --> 23:33.662
if you didn't participate
in the therapy, Wyatt.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.372
Sure I did.
There's-there's my art.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.375
That's not art.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.668
It's a penis.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.254
It's a cactus. See?

23:42.295 --> 23:44.589
That's a flower
right there on that testicle.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.011
Lady, it's not my fault
that I'm bad at art.

23:50.053 --> 23:50.971
Art is gay.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.271
Hey. You...

23:59.312 --> 24:01.106
look just like...

24:01.148 --> 24:02.691
Rosa Ortecho?

24:02.732 --> 24:04.568
Yeah, I-I get
that all the time.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.404
I'm her cousin Rosalinda,
but I-I never met her.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.822
I was really young
when she died.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.616
I've known the Ortecho family
my entire life

24:11.658 --> 24:13.994
and there is no such thing
as a Rosalinda.

24:14.035 --> 24:16.204
Okay,

24:16.246 --> 24:18.415
well, then,
go with the logical explanation.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.461
I'm her ghost. Boo.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.225
What are you doing here, Max?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.518
I can feel you're stressed.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.438
Need me to adjust the pacemaker?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.023
I want you to finish the cage.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.946
(laughs softly)
And I don't need a mindscape

24:49.988 --> 24:51.740
to tell you're lying
about delaying it.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.408
We have answers here
we can't ignore.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.994
We can,
and we should.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.037
'Cause what we have here
is someone

24:57.078 --> 24:58.330
our moms called the devil.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.789
Safely locked away.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.042
All our lives you've been
asking questions.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.627
Uh-- what happened
to that Michael Guerin?

25:03.668 --> 25:05.420
What happened to the Max Evans

25:05.462 --> 25:06.838
who covered up a murder
to keep our secret?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.715
I was wrong to do that.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.761
I was a scared 17-year-old kid.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.554
But I can't afford
to be scared anymore.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.724
Maybe we should be scared.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.018
According to Tripp's journals,
Jones stepped off a ship

25:20.060 --> 25:22.103
and he ignited a war
between humans and aliens

25:22.145 --> 25:23.688
with a flick of his wrist.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.692
You don't want to finish
the cage, fine.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.027
I'll find another way to do it.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.781
To what?

25:32.822 --> 25:34.866
What, you're gonna
build one yourself?

25:36.701 --> 25:39.454
What has gotten into you?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.248
I can feel it, too.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.250
What are you keeping from us?

25:43.291 --> 25:45.126
D-Did something happen?

25:45.168 --> 25:47.045
When Jones touched you
before we threw him in the pod?

25:47.087 --> 25:48.922
No, it's not, it's not that.

25:48.964 --> 25:49.923
Well, it's something.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.968
And if you don't come
clean, I think Iz

25:53.009 --> 25:54.469
should get inside his head,

25:54.511 --> 25:55.762
play another round of truth

25:55.804 --> 25:56.805
to get to the heart
of the matter?

25:59.307 --> 26:01.810
The heart is what's the matter.

26:06.481 --> 26:08.733
No. No.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.862
You're better.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.116
Valenti did a transplant.
It's better.

26:16.157 --> 26:17.701
Yeah...

26:17.742 --> 26:19.744
and my body's rejecting it.

26:23.873 --> 26:26.001
My time is almost up.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.173
I'm dying.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.769
(sighs) You've known for a year.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.605
We-we could've had time
to save you.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.898
If I told you a year ago

26:48.940 --> 26:51.318
you would've just
wasted that time again.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.819
What are you talking about?

26:52.861 --> 26:54.904
We didn't waste our time
last year. You're alive.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.619
You didn't think that I was
strong enough to handle this.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.996
No, I just wanted to leave you
with good memories.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.539
Oh, and you thought
that's what we needed?

27:04.581 --> 27:06.583
A year of tequila
and skeet shooting

27:06.625 --> 27:07.751
and then you're through?

27:07.792 --> 27:10.587
I was trying to do right by you.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.088
Both of you.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.343
You know,
it was the craziest thing.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.802
My girlfriend dumped me,

27:17.844 --> 27:19.846
I'm broker
than I've ever been,

27:19.888 --> 27:22.223
Alex took off, there was
a global pandemic, and yet,

27:22.265 --> 27:24.017
I was happy.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.393
Because this.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.936
Because us three,
because we were good.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.356
And I was wrong.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.523
Well, there's still time
for answers.

27:30.565 --> 27:31.650
Max, just don't!

27:35.320 --> 27:36.780
We didn't deserve this.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.748
LIZ:
You got to take
a deep breath, buddy.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.291
We still got to get
to the third floor.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.959
Hey, you know what?
Remove a plasid from a bacteria,

27:50.001 --> 27:51.127
I'm your guy.
I'm not Ethan Hunt.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.796
I still have student loans.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.048
It's America. Everyone
has student loans.

27:55.090 --> 27:58.259
How are you so calm?
I'm always good
when it comes to the science.

27:58.301 --> 27:59.803
In this instance, I'm fighting
for the chance to keep doing it.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.054
Well, then, I suppose
you have some brilliant,

28:01.096 --> 28:03.264
cutting-edge plan
to get past this.

28:03.306 --> 28:04.933
Actually, we're gonna hit the
yellow wire with 50,000 volts.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.769
(exhales):
Okay.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.523
HEATH:
You know what's weird?
I didn't realize that you were

28:11.564 --> 28:13.566
so familiar with
electrical currents.
I'm not.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.694
I used to know somebody...

28:15.735 --> 28:18.071
You know what?
It's not important, so...

28:18.113 --> 28:19.864
Ready?

28:19.906 --> 28:21.282
(electricity sparking)

28:24.411 --> 28:26.246
(gasps, laughs)

28:29.791 --> 28:31.584
(chuckles):
Hey.
Hey.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.294
Haven't seen you
around here lately.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.797
Yeah. Oh, you know,
Alex is back.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.299
Did you, uh, come to
invite me to the wedding?

28:38.341 --> 28:40.427
Had to go and make it awkward,
huh, DeLuca?

28:41.928 --> 28:43.763
But no.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.682
This is alien business.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.563
I heard you had
a funeral vision.

28:51.604 --> 28:53.356
Came here to stop you

28:53.398 --> 28:55.191
from throwing on your cape
and playing hero about it.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.152
We're not having
last year's conversation

28:57.193 --> 28:58.820
all over again, are we?

28:58.862 --> 29:00.822
I didn't come here to
fall into old patterns.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.743
It's Max in the coffin.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.999
His body is rejecting
Noah's heart.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.417
Oh, my God, Michael.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.168
I'm so sorry.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.753
I'm sorry.

29:18.673 --> 29:21.259
I just came here to give you
some clarity, okay?

29:21.301 --> 29:23.428
Um, before anyone
gets hurt more.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.650
Okay. My hacker buddy
rewrote the chip, so...
Mm-hmm.

29:37.692 --> 29:40.779
COMPUTER:
Dr. Margot Meyerson identified.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.031
Testing resting heart rate.
(exhales)

29:43.072 --> 29:43.573
What? What?

29:43.573 --> 29:45.825
No. Did we know about this test?
No.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.494
Fail. 71.

29:47.535 --> 29:50.872
I-I mean, her resting heart rate
must be higher than yours.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.749
Okay, let's test your ticker.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.503
Resting heart rate

29:56.544 --> 29:58.755
outside range for Meyerson.
Should I do some jumping jacks?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.089
No, no, no.
That's gonna make it skyrocket.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.591
Okay, so, then,
I'm going to jail.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.385
I think you like me.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.346
What?

30:06.387 --> 30:08.181
I think you thought
that a good bottle of wine

30:08.223 --> 30:10.308
and a drive around the hills
would lead to a kiss.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.645
76.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.647
Oh, you do want to kiss me.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.857
78.
I mean,

30:17.899 --> 30:19.859
we're already
breaking the rules.

30:19.901 --> 30:22.570
What's one more naughty thing

30:22.612 --> 30:24.948
to just pile on top?

30:27.200 --> 30:28.576
82. Resting heart rate success.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.954
Ooh!

30:30.995 --> 30:33.456
Welcome to the third floor,
Margot Meyerson.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.333
After you, partner.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.626
Cute.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.719
(sighs)
I need to get a social circle

30:46.761 --> 30:48.471
that can't unlock doors
with their mind.

30:50.390 --> 30:53.810
Well, fear not, Valenti.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.564
Apparently, that circle
is rapidly shrinking.

30:57.605 --> 30:59.607
He told you.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.281
Can you mentally unlock
the top file cabinet, please?

31:08.783 --> 31:10.451
(high-pitched ringing)

31:20.336 --> 31:22.505
(sighs)
What's on your mind?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.465
Treatment.
What Liz,

31:24.507 --> 31:26.718
Guerin, and I did
with duct tape and bubble gum

31:26.759 --> 31:29.512
still needed Rosa and a small
miracle to get Evans upright.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.139
If I thought
there was an answer,

31:31.180 --> 31:32.932
I'd personally
drive Liz back here.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.604
This is the part
where you pour me more tequila

31:37.645 --> 31:38.938
and tell me there isn't.

31:48.031 --> 31:52.327
Okay, just don't give me
any cheesy pamphlets to read.

31:52.368 --> 31:55.663
I keep hoping Alex would pop in
with some...

31:55.705 --> 31:58.833
alien glass piece that holds
a medical textbook on you.

32:00.293 --> 32:03.212
But there is no you to study.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.298
Worse, there's nobody
from your planet

32:05.340 --> 32:07.216
to ask about how you work.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.427
(sighs)
I don't know.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.766
How much time does he have?

32:14.807 --> 32:16.559
In my case study of one...

32:16.601 --> 32:18.144
not long.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.072
Thank you...

32:29.113 --> 32:30.782
for caring.

32:30.823 --> 32:33.117
"Do no harm" is
right on that door.

32:38.247 --> 32:41.876
We all know you do
far more than that.

32:44.671 --> 32:48.174
(deep rumbling)

32:49.842 --> 32:51.302
(exhales)

32:51.344 --> 32:53.304
(rumbling stops)

32:59.477 --> 33:00.812
LIZ (on recording):
Vitals are normal...

33:00.853 --> 33:02.897
for Max.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.358
His sutures are healing well.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.445
Color is back
in his cheeks and fingertips.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.991
His hands feel
like his hands again.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.953
Max, I know you can't hear me.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.580
Or maybe it's different for you.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.790
(crying softly)

33:20.832 --> 33:22.750
Can you feel me
holding your hand?

33:22.792 --> 33:23.751
(sniffles)

33:23.793 --> 33:25.044
(recorder clicks)

33:26.421 --> 33:28.339
ALEX:
All this with Max,

33:28.381 --> 33:29.966
it really makes you wonder
what you would do

33:30.008 --> 33:30.925
if you were on borrowed time.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.261
Mm-hmm.

33:33.302 --> 33:35.763
Do you ever wish
you knew more about your dad?

33:35.805 --> 33:38.558
And potentially uncover
more half siblings?

33:38.599 --> 33:39.892
No, thanks.

33:39.934 --> 33:42.562
I, uh, I might have a chance

33:42.603 --> 33:44.939
to find out more
than my dad ever could.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.899
(groans)
Haven't we swiped
enough alien bodies

33:46.941 --> 33:49.235
from the morgue in one lifetime?

33:49.277 --> 33:52.697
Look, if I take it,
I have a feeling

33:52.739 --> 33:55.074
I won't be having too many
more of these fireside chats.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.036

34:04.292 --> 34:06.085

I cannot help but think that...

34:25.646 --> 34:27.648

34:27.690 --> 34:32.153
...if my family oversaw
something that went so wrong...

34:32.195 --> 34:36.657
maybe there is someone out there
who could have gotten it right.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.369
I just came back
from a convention

34:40.411 --> 34:42.163
in transplant medicine

34:42.205 --> 34:44.290
where specialists
from all over the world

34:44.332 --> 34:47.293
shared their experiences.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.213
Yeah, listening
to them talk, it...

34:50.254 --> 34:53.382
reminded me what I used to love
so much about being a doctor.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.635
What, the rush of discovery?

34:55.676 --> 34:58.596
No, the camaraderie

35:00.348 --> 35:01.891
