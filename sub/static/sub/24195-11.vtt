He's a rich man.

00:09.291 --> 00:11.417
There always have been rumors
as to the way he earned it.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.917
You are willing to testify

00:13.000 --> 00:15.458
Jock Jeffcoat profited

00:15.542 --> 00:16.417
I know he does.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.000
We're doing a massive
cap raise.

00:18.083 --> 00:20.208
Welcome to the new

00:20.291 --> 00:21.750
He fired you.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.542
I was fodder. Don't try

00:24.625 --> 00:27.083
So, is it prison
or start talking?

00:27.166 --> 00:28.208
Let's do this.

00:28.291 --> 00:30.709
Who the hell gave you
permission to talk to my son.

00:30.792 --> 00:32.166
Good thing
is there's no paperwork.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.250
Off the books.
The Chuck Rhoades Special.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.542
Your best friend sold you
down the river for nothing.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.458
I'm willing to pay you
30 million to tell the truth.

00:38.542 --> 00:41.166
But I sure as hell will testify
about what Chuck Rhoades did.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.542
You sold out
my relationship.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.583
No, no. You did.

00:45.667 --> 00:48.166
That's why you told me
he was at your dinner.

but he's the second coming

02:16.125 --> 02:19.875
So you weren't able
to substantiate what we know...

02:19.959 --> 02:21.792
the brother,
the cable company.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.458
We have embarked
on a one-way mission here.

02:24.542 --> 02:28.125
We either get to the other side
and line dance on Jock's grave

02:28.208 --> 02:31.375
or he will most assuredly
be doing the Tush Push on ours.

02:31.458 --> 02:33.291
Anybody who knew anything wasn't

02:33.375 --> 02:35.875

02:35.959 --> 02:37.750

04:33.417 --> 04:36.125
Uh, Taiga's out of town.
Visiting family.

04:36.208 --> 04:38.917
Hmm. So you're a bachelor

SoulCycle, but--

04:54.792 --> 04:57.083
Mm. For yoga. Mm.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.166

The bitch is a born thief."

18:53.125 --> 18:56.083
You talking about my wife?
You looked into her?

18:56.166 --> 19:00.625
She needed looking into,
so I looked. Go on.

19:00.709 --> 19:04.458
Her business is...
well, there is no business.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.375

was transferred

19:06.458 --> 19:09.208

I didn't want to be.

20:18.542 --> 20:19.792

20:19.875 --> 20:23.542

That would be
obstruction of justice.

28:59.458 --> 29:01.000
Yes. Yes, it would.

it's still Ira.

31:49.667 --> 31:51.875
I could be bounded

32:07.417 --> 32:08.667
And this rift
between us,

32:08.750 --> 32:11.500
however he fought back,
I caused it.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.834
I used him as an instrument,
not thinking,

32:13.917 --> 32:17.291
not caring
what I was taking from him.

32:17.375 --> 32:18.625
And I know, deep down,
if I were back there,

32:18.709 --> 32:22.667
I would do it again.

32:22.750 --> 32:26.166

32:42.959 --> 32:44.709

really matter?

32:49.542 --> 32:51.667
Why can't you give Taylor
what they want?

32:51.750 --> 32:53.291
Because it's too much.

32:53.375 --> 32:54.959
And what they want
can't be given.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.208
It needs to be taken.

32:56.291 --> 32:57.959
And what would you do
if they tried to take it?

32:58.041 --> 32:59.875
Cut 'em down
like I was Connor MacLeod.

32:59.959 --> 33:02.709
What does it say

33:02.792 --> 33:05.166
that you always have to quote
the damn Highlander?

33:05.250 --> 33:07.834
That I spent some time
watching cable TV alone

33:07.917 --> 33:10.000
in high school.
And that I have pristine taste

33:10.083 --> 33:12.834
in movies,
even back then.

33:12.917 --> 33:14.709
Or, that you see
every single challenge

33:14.792 --> 33:16.166
as a life
or death contest

33:16.250 --> 33:18.375
to see who's gonna
lose their head.

33:18.458 --> 33:20.542
Well, kind of is
from where I stand.

33:20.625 --> 33:22.208
You really think I should give
Taylor what they want?

33:22.291 --> 33:25.709
I think you should convince
Taylor that you're partners.

33:25.792 --> 33:26.917
I'm kind of surprised
that you're taking their side.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.625
You and I are on
the exact same side.

33:29.709 --> 33:32.375
They are on the other.

33:32.458 --> 33:34.250
But I want them
happy and earning.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.875
Well, yeah. Me too.

33:36.959 --> 33:39.083
You sure?

33:39.166 --> 33:42.083
'Cause you know
how to keep somebody,

33:42.166 --> 33:43.959

So I say to you,
Anthony:

39:56.375 --> 39:58.500
Don't make this
a federal case.

40:01.542 --> 40:03.417
Ah, Jesus.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.291
Oh, and whatever
I do to you,

40:05.375 --> 40:08.542
I can do to anyone you gave
any of that money to,

40:08.625 --> 40:10.083
like your family.

40:10.166 --> 40:12.125
I really should take
a closer look at them.

40:12.208 --> 40:13.959
You're
a real sonofabitch.

40:14.041 --> 40:15.792
Oh. A lot of people
hate me.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.333
Tell him
why they hate me, Karl.

40:17.417 --> 40:18.875
You're a real sonofabitch.

40:18.959 --> 40:20.583
I am.
Especially when

40:20.667 --> 40:23.542
you've fucked with someone
I care about.

40:56.208 --> 40:57.834
How goes
your data scrape?

40:57.917 --> 40:59.417
I met with IT,
explained the sensitivity.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.375
I've established
a series of searches

41:13.417 --> 41:15.709
To help rebuild your rep.

41:15.792 --> 41:17.625
Maybe I did it
to shield you.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.542
So it wouldn't be your ass
on the line.

41:19.625 --> 41:21.166
Uh-huh.
Either way,

41:21.250 --> 41:23.792
don't be too zealous
in finding wrongdoing here.

41:23.875 --> 41:25.917
Jock's perch
is many miles away.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.542
But the people
in this building,

41:27.625 --> 41:29.834
you gotta live with them
every day.

41:32.500 --> 41:37.542
My boy, my boy,
my prodigal boy.

41:39.250 --> 41:42.667
What more can I do
for you?

41:42.750 --> 41:45.709
I'd like to use
your apartment.

41:45.792 --> 41:47.917
I know that Mom
is in Palm Beach

41:48.000 --> 41:50.917
and I need some privacy.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.166
You also had to know
I'd ask why, so...

41:54.250 --> 41:56.500
out with it.

41:56.583 --> 41:59.542
I need a private place
to meet with a young woman.

42:01.667 --> 42:03.417
I appreciate
that you're smart enough

42:03.500 --> 42:05.625
not to take this
to a hotel,

42:05.709 --> 42:07.166
it's too public.

42:07.250 --> 42:11.542
Even with things being the way
they've been between us,

42:11.625 --> 42:13.417
I'm proud you know

42:13.500 --> 42:15.375
you can always come to me.
It's not really like that,

42:15.458 --> 42:17.375
Dad.
I've always said:

42:17.458 --> 42:20.417
monogamy is
a form of socialism.

42:20.500 --> 42:21.834
It's testosterone
redistribution

42:21.917 --> 42:25.959
so a few bucks don't keep
all the does to themselves.

42:26.041 --> 42:27.291
I'm doing this for Ira.

42:27.375 --> 42:30.625
I'm taking care
of something

42:30.709 --> 42:33.834
that he can't
take care of himself.

42:33.917 --> 42:37.208
So it's not concupiscence,
it's menschkeit.

42:37.291 --> 42:39.458
I'm even prouder.

42:40.917 --> 42:42.291
When is she due?

42:42.375 --> 42:43.709
Hour or so.

42:43.792 --> 42:44.834
I could stay,

42:44.917 --> 42:46.083
in an advisory capacity--

42:46.166 --> 42:47.583
No. No.

42:47.667 --> 42:50.125
Thank you, Dad,
no, um, I just need the space.

42:50.208 --> 42:52.709
Mm-hmm.

42:56.709 --> 42:59.875
Taiga, I don't know you
very well.

42:59.959 --> 43:00.834
I didn't try
to get to know you,

43:00.917 --> 43:02.583
and that's on me.
Perhaps I thought Ira

43:02.667 --> 43:04.959
would move on
to someone more--

43:05.041 --> 43:07.792
Substantial?

43:07.875 --> 43:10.417
Closer to
his age bracket.

43:11.417 --> 43:14.000
So I'm at a bit of a loss
whether to appeal

43:14.083 --> 43:19.000
to your decency,
your vanity, your avarice...

43:19.083 --> 43:22.834
or just to
your fear center.

43:22.917 --> 43:24.208
Please.

43:24.291 --> 43:26.250
Anthony returned
the money,

43:26.333 --> 43:28.583
even got back the deposit
on that apartment.

43:28.667 --> 43:30.375
And now he's gone.

43:30.458 --> 43:32.625
You chased him off.
I did.

43:32.709 --> 43:35.041
And I can't say
that you were wrong.

43:35.125 --> 43:36.583
I'm embarrassed
and ashamed and, yes,

43:36.667 --> 43:39.917
I am afraid of whatever
you're gonna do next.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.041
So congratulations.

43:42.125 --> 43:43.917
Your fucked up tactics
fucked me up.

43:49.417 --> 43:52.709
This is
a postnuptial agreement.

43:52.792 --> 43:54.834
It entitles you
to 50,000 dollars

43:54.917 --> 43:58.458
for every year you stay
in the marriage.

43:58.542 --> 44:00.542
Which means, all told,
you'll be walking away

44:00.625 --> 44:01.917
with 50,000 dollars.

44:04.542 --> 44:06.166
You don't need to read it.

44:06.250 --> 44:08.709
I may play dirty,
but I don't deal dirty.

44:08.792 --> 44:10.709
Just sign it,
take it to Ira,

44:10.792 --> 44:13.083
and then tell him
that you're leaving,

44:13.166 --> 44:17.208
but that you wanted to do it
with integrity.

44:34.166 --> 44:37.000
I liked him.

44:39.083 --> 44:41.083
And I really did try
to love him.

44:41.166 --> 44:44.208
Try harder.

44:44.291 --> 44:46.166
-Dad--
-You give a marriage seven years

44:46.250 --> 44:47.417
before you even entertain

44:47.500 --> 44:48.583
-the notion of a divorce.
-Dad.

44:48.667 --> 44:51.667
From the day the Dorsey Brothers
showed that Presley boy

44:51.750 --> 44:53.041
swiveling his hips,

44:53.125 --> 44:54.250
there's been a slow
but steady erosion

44:54.333 --> 44:56.291
of the family.

44:56.375 --> 44:58.250
Well, here is how
you keep one going:

44:58.333 --> 44:59.750
You find a group of friends
better than you,

44:59.834 --> 45:04.583
find one worse,
bitch about them to each other,

45:04.667 --> 45:06.750
and then
when you're all bitched out,

45:06.834 --> 45:07.834
run ten miles a day.

45:07.917 --> 45:11.667
Take your birth control pills
and flush them;

45:11.750 --> 45:15.542
and make that kid
your project together.

45:15.625 --> 45:18.542
And if Ira doesn't know
how to fuck you,

45:18.625 --> 45:19.792
you teach him.

45:19.875 --> 45:21.458
Okay. Yeah.

45:21.542 --> 45:23.625
I'm not done.
One more thing:

45:23.709 --> 45:26.041
give yourself the lime test.
You stick your finger

45:26.125 --> 45:27.792
in lime juice
and put it up inside.

45:27.875 --> 45:29.834
And if it stings,
get yourself cleaned out.

45:29.917 --> 45:34.875
Do not bring the clap
home to your husband;

45:34.959 --> 45:36.291
it's uncivil.

45:47.834 --> 45:49.959
That's what you meant
by "advisor"?

45:50.041 --> 45:53.458
Ira doesn't want or need
another divorce.

45:53.542 --> 45:55.333
He needs a wife who's broken in.

45:55.417 --> 45:58.500
And since he can't break her,
I'll do it for him.

46:00.875 --> 46:04.959
This is what's gonna
make him happy.

46:05.041 --> 46:09.000
And that's what you want,
right, son?

46:11.583 --> 46:15.083
I've missed you, Dad.

46:22.083 --> 46:25.583
Normally we go over
your legal bill on the phone.

46:25.667 --> 46:28.333
To avoid... you know.

46:28.417 --> 46:30.583
After today, I don't think
I'm gonna be writing

46:30.667 --> 46:32.834
any fat checks
for a while.

46:32.917 --> 46:33.667
Plus,
this year's tab,

46:33.750 --> 46:36.542
you outdid yourself.
Record-setting.

46:36.625 --> 46:38.375
I knocked 30 percent
off the hours before

46:38.458 --> 46:39.583

46:39.667 --> 46:40.792
Sure.
Of course you did,

46:40.875 --> 46:42.750
because you inflated 'em
in the first place.

46:42.834 --> 46:43.709
Ten million
fucking dollars--

46:43.792 --> 46:46.291
You're gonna haggle
with me,

46:46.375 --> 46:48.000

I delivered?

46:48.083 --> 46:49.375
You delivered it?

46:49.458 --> 46:51.166
I seem to remember
you encouraging me

46:51.250 --> 46:53.208

and take a plea.

Leaving me to figure out
how to work miracles.

46:54.709 --> 46:57.375

do you want to fucking pay?

46:57.458 --> 46:58.875
Not a penny
over nine million.

46:58.959 --> 47:00.875
You're doing this
over a million dollars--

47:00.959 --> 47:02.667
-Mm.
-A number that doesn't mean

47:02.750 --> 47:05.291

I still would have.
