00:09.843 --> 00:11.177
Mr. Schuester!
Yeah?

00:11.261 --> 00:13.221
I went to the library and
I got some sheet music...

00:13.305 --> 00:16.057
and I wanted to run some songs
by you that feature me
heavily on lead vocal.

00:16.141 --> 00:18.101
Thanks, Rach, but I already
got one picked out.

00:18.227 --> 00:22.563
Let me help you with that.
Thanks, Finn.
You're so chivalrous.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.149
Thanks. That's
a good thing, right?
Morning, guys.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.527
Hey, Mr. Schue. We're just
learning some runs.
Oh, yeah?

00:27.611 --> 00:30.071
So it goes—

00:30.197 --> 00:32.198
With the finger, huh?
Pretty fly for a white guy.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.451
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Hey, don't be late for
rehearsal this afternoon.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.078
Okay.
All right.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.665
Morning, Kurt.
Buenos nachos, Mr. Schue.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.710
[Chuckling]
Hey! Let's go Titans.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.712
Yeah. Come on.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.714
Wait.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.758
One day you will all
work for me.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.599
Diana, thank you
so much for that apple.

00:58.684 --> 01:02.353
It was very, very nice of you.
All right? [Chuckles]

01:04.314 --> 01:06.065
Oh!
[Gasps]
Oh, Will! Oh, gosh.

01:06.150 --> 01:07.734
Hey, Emma.
Hi.

01:07.818 --> 01:12.071
Hey. I wanted to thank you
so much for the advice
you gave me the other day.

01:12.156 --> 01:15.450
I mean, teaching here
and coaching Glee Club-
It's where I belong.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.578
Oh, it's no problem.
I mean, it's what I do. I give
counsel and give guidance.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.705
I'm a guidance counselor.
Yeah, you are.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.832
Oh, look. We match.
Periwinkle.
Yeah.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.208
Get a room.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.502
Miss Sylvester wants
to see you in her office,
Mr. Schue.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.756
She doesn't like
to be kept waiting.
You got it.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.674
[Chuckles]

01:31.759 --> 01:33.676
[Bell Rings]

01:36.180 --> 01:38.639
- Hey, Sue. You want to see me?
- Hey, buddy. Come on in.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.809
- [Treadmill Beeping]
- [Groans]
I just blasted my hammies.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.561
Oh.
[Laughs]

01:43.645 --> 01:45.563
- Iron tablet?
- Uh-

01:45.647 --> 01:48.024
Keeps your strength up
while you're menstruating.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.652
- I don't menstruate.
- Yeah? Neither do I.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.655
So, I had a little chat
with Principal Figgins,

01:54.740 --> 01:57.575
and he said that if your group
doesn't place at regionals,

01:57.659 --> 01:59.285
he's cutting the program.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.703
Ouch.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.122
You don't have
to worry about Glee Club.
We're gonna be fine.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.957
Really? 'Cause I was
at the local library,

02:05.042 --> 02:07.919
where I read
Cheerleading Today aloud...

02:08.003 --> 02:11.923
to blind geriatrics,
and I came across
this little page-turner.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.884
Show Choir Rule Book.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.679
And turns out, you need 12 kids
to qualify for regionals.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.058
Last time I looked,
you only had
five and a half.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.227
Here. Cripple in the wheelchair.

02:24.311 --> 02:28.022
I also took the liberty
of highlighting some
special ed classes for you.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.191
Maybe you could find
some recruits.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.736
'Cause I'm not sure
there's anybody else
who's gonna wanna swim over...

02:33.821 --> 02:37.114
to your island of misfit toys.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.910
- Are you threatening me, Sue?
- Threatening you?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.745
Oh, no, no, no.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.665
Presenting you
with an opportunity
to compromise yourself?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.584
You betcha.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.629
Let's break it down.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.340
You want to be creative.
You want to be in
the spotlight.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.801
Face it. You want to be me.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.719
[Stifled Chuckle]
So here's the deal.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.806
You do with your depressing
little group of kids...

03:01.890 --> 03:04.809
what I did with my wealthy,
elderly mother.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.812
Euthanize it. It's time.

03:07.896 --> 03:11.357
And then I'll be happy
to offer you a job as
my second assistant on Cheerios.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.236
You can fetch me Gatorade
and launder my soiled delicates.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.530
It'll be very
rewarding work for you.

03:17.614 --> 03:21.784
You know what, Sue?
I politely decline your offer.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.079
Glee Club is here to stay.
I believe in my kids.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.082
I know you're used to being
the cock of the walk
around here.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.584
Offensive.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.086
But it looks like
your Cheerios are gonna
have some competition.

03:32.170 --> 03:36.507
We're gonna show at regionals.
You have my word on that.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.176
Have a good day.

to be the most popular kids
in the school...

Yeah. I know.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.397
Prom king and queen.
Homecoming court royalty.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.692
I am not giving up
those shiny crowns just
so you can express yourself.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.445
Look, you're making
too big a deal out of this.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.406
Okay. Let's compromise.

04:00.490 --> 04:04.201
If you quit the club,
I'll let you touch
my breast.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.704
- Under the shirt?
- Over the bra.

04:08.373 --> 04:12.084
- No, no. I can't.

I want to do Glee.
I'm really happy
when I'm performing.

People think
you're gay now, Finn.
And you know what that makes me?

04:18.300 --> 04:22.345
Your big gay beard.
Look. I-I gotta go
to class. Okay?

Just relax.
Everything's gonna work out.

Time for some girl talk,

04:33.732 --> 04:37.652
You can dance with him.
You can sing with him.
But you will never have him.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.988
I understand why you'd be
threatened. Finn and I
have made a connection.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.533
But I'm an honorable person.
I don't need to steal
your man.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.911
I have plenty of suitors
of my own.

is going down. Deal with it.

at the pep assembly.

- In front of the whole school?
- Exactly.

I can't express to you
how important this
assembly is.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.980
We need recruits.
There are six of you.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.190
We need 12 to qualify
for regionals.

05:58.275 --> 06:01.193
We have no choice,
or the club is over.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.195
I know you guys
don't like this song,

06:03.280 --> 06:06.157
but we took nationals
back in '93 with "Freak Out."

06:06.241 --> 06:10.161
It's a crowd-pleaser. Trust me.
From the top.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.163
I'm dead.

[Will Narrating] My father
always said you become a man
when you buy your first house.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.718
I'm not sure
what he meant by that...

06:25.802 --> 06:28.345
since he burned ours down once
after a drunken fight with Mom.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.973
Welcome to your little slice
of the American dream.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.226
I have a question
about the trees.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.313
It's always been
my personal dream to cut
down my own Christmas tree.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.732
How many Christmas trees
will we have in
the backyard?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.567
And do they come
in different colors?

06:41.651 --> 06:44.195
Because, well, obviously
we're expecting a family.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.113
I have a real sense
it might be a girl.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.783
[Will Narrating]
Still, I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.534
It all happened so fast.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.870
[Children Screaming]

06:52.954 --> 06:57.333
It all started when Terri's
sister Kendra brought her kids
over for Sunday brunch.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.711
Well, I just don't understand
where you're planning on
putting the nursery.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.130
- I know.
- Well, we have
a second bedroom.

07:03.215 --> 07:06.967
You are not giving up
your craft room, Terri.
A mother needs her respite.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.261

thing that's gonna keep you
from going...

Anyway, this conversation
is over.

on a new section of our
subdivision.

07:41.044 --> 07:44.130
This banister was made
by Ecuadorean children.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.091
It's great, Terri, but there
are nine foreclosures
on our street.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.135
Why can't we buy
one of those?
They're half the price.

07:49.219 --> 07:53.180
I'm not raising my baby
in a used house.
They're not clean. [Gasps]

07:53.265 --> 07:56.392
Look at the sun nook.
Isn't it beautiful?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.519
Is it extra?
Mmm.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.980
The price in the brochure
is for the basic model.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.232
Everything else is à la carte.

08:03.316 --> 08:08.737
The grand foyer is an extra
14,000, and the sun nook
is an extra 24.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.782

I'll let you two talk.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.826
Thank you.
Thank you. Hmm.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.663
[Sighs]
We can't afford this.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.000
We already did the math, Will.
All we have to do is
give up Applebee's...

08:21.084 --> 08:23.043
and we won't run the A.C.
for the first couple
of summers.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.338
Well, we certainly can't
afford the grand foyer
and the sun nook.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.717
I mean, if we bite off
more than we can chew,
we'll lose everything.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.844
You need to pick one.
[Chuckles]

08:31.928 --> 08:35.306
Come with me. I'm gonna
show you something
really special.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.350
[Terri]
This is where our daughter
or gay son will sleep.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.686
I thought maybe we could
put one of those
mini pianos in here...

08:40.770 --> 08:43.689
and you two could
put on shows for me.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.942
I love it, Terri,
but we still can't
afford everything.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.781
[Sighs]
It's my very own
Sophie's choice.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.037
Fine. I'm gonna
give up the sun nook
for the grand foyer.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.039
But I really need
the polished door handles.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.543
Think of our family, Will.
This is our dream.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.713
[Will Narrating]
I knew in that moment that
I would do whatever it took,

09:07.797 --> 09:11.008
even if it meant
getting a part-time job
to make some extra money,

09:11.092 --> 09:13.719
to make that dream come true.

before you dress yourself.
Whatever. Whatever.

a Technicolor zebra.

You're a hater.
That's what you are.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.564
I look like I'm a part of it.
You're trying to copy me.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.358
It looks like I planned it.
If your hair was longer,
you'd have curls.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.360
All right, guys.
How about a little Kanye?

09:29.444 --> 09:30.986
[Gasps]
Sweet!

09:31.071 --> 09:33.322
For the assembly?
No. We won't
be ready in time.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.242
We're still doing disco.
But we can fold this
into our repertoire,

09:36.326 --> 09:39.078
and it'll be awesome
at regionals.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.873
Communication is the foundation
of any successful music group.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.542
If we’re gonna succeed,
we need to communicate.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.586
You guys said you
wanted modern music,
I listened.

09:47.671 --> 09:51.507
Mr. Schue, we'd really
like to not do disco
at that assembly.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.259
- Finn, you're gonna
take the solo.
- What?

09:53.343 --> 09:54.927
No, I can't do
the solo, Mr. Schue.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.846
I'm still learning
how to walk and sing
at the same time.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.142
No problem.
I'll walk you through it.

- Okay.
- Grossed me out.

Okay. But I still
want to talk about
the feelings that you had...

to puke your guts out.

You know, one of the amazing
things about being in

21:21.781 --> 21:24.240
Let's pair up for
the "Immaculate Affection."

21:24.325 --> 21:27.243
Now, remember,
if the balloon pops,

21:27.328 --> 21:29.829
the noise
makes the angels cry.

21:43.052 --> 21:46.137
You enchant me.
[Boy]
Yeah.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.391
Just stop it!
Take it. Ah, yeah!

21:50.434 --> 21:52.936
Finn!
It must have hit my zipper.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.439
You know what?
This is a joke.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.984
Did you know that most studies
have demonstrated...

21:59.068 --> 22:01.111
that celibacy doesn't work
in high schools?

22:01.195 --> 22:04.364
Our hormones are driving us
too crazy to abstain.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.366
The second we start
telling ourselves...

22:06.450 --> 22:08.368
that there's no room
for compromise, we act out.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.162
The only way to deal
with teen sexuality
is to be prepared.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.164
That's what contraception
is for.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.250
Don't you dare mention
the "C" word.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.294
You want to know
a dirty little secret...

22:18.379 --> 22:20.922
that none of them
want you to know?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.091
Girls want sex
just as much as guys do.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.764
I-Is that accurate?

22:38.899 --> 22:41.401
- Will?
- Aaah!

22:41.485 --> 22:44.487
Emma— What are you
doing here so late?

22:45.781 --> 22:47.991
I do S.A.T. prep
on Tuesday nights.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.076
Are you, um—
Are you a janitor?

22:50.161 --> 22:52.120
Aja— no.

22:52.204 --> 22:56.958
Really? 'Cause you're
dressed like a janitor,
and your shirt says "Will."

22:57.043 --> 22:59.836
Um, Terri and I are
trying to buy a house...

22:59.920 --> 23:02.464
and we're, you know,
struggling to make
ends meet, and—

23:03.716 --> 23:07.093
[Sighs]
I'm really embarrassed.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.389
Would you mind
keeping this between us?

23:11.474 --> 23:13.391
Yeah.

23:13.476 --> 23:16.686
Oh, yeah, your secret's
completely safe with me.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.480
Thank you.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.566
Do you, um—
Do you want a hand?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.777
Oh- No.
I-I'm good, really.

23:23.861 --> 23:26.071
Really? Because
I can see from here...

23:26.155 --> 23:28.073
that you've used
window cleaner
to mop the floor.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.658
And, uh, that keyboard
is crawling in E. coli,

23:30.743 --> 23:32.702
because I know for
a fact Ms. Hoffmeyer...

23:32.787 --> 23:35.163
doesn't wash her hands
after doing number twos.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.586
I really admire you working
so hard for something
you want.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.799
Let's make a deal.
You're helping me
with my problem.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.884
How about I take a stab
at one of yours?

23:47.968 --> 23:51.387
Oh, no, I don't—
I don't have a problem.

23:51.472 --> 23:54.015
You've been scrubbing
that pencil sharpener
for an hour.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.017
Well, I mean, I have-

23:56.102 --> 24:00.980
I have a little trouble
with messes, but it's not
like it's a problem.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.779
Okay.

24:07.863 --> 24:11.699
When I was a little girl,
it was my dream
to work on a dairy farm.

24:11.826 --> 24:16.079
Really?
Yeah. And when I was eight,
we finally visited one,

24:16.163 --> 24:18.498
and after the tour
and the yogurt tasting,

24:18.582 --> 24:22.210
my- my brother pushed me
into the runoff lagoon.

24:22.336 --> 24:26.047
What?
And, um, ever since then,
I've just—

24:26.132 --> 24:30.009
I've had a little trouble
forgetting the, uh—
the smell.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.265
Have you thought about—
I don't know-
maybe seeing someone about that?

24:35.349 --> 24:37.475
Oh, no.
It's completely manageable.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.104
You know, I just- I take
lots of showers and I, um—
You know, I don't eat dairy.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.106
So it's—

24:44.859 --> 24:46.860
I want to try...

24:48.904 --> 24:50.822
a little experiment.
Oh, no.

24:50.906 --> 24:55.577
No, I'm not really, um,
comfortable with—
with that-

25:06.589 --> 25:09.757
There.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.093
Ten seconds.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.262
New record.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.518
It's late.
I should, um-

25:20.603 --> 25:23.354
I should be, um, going.

25:33.407 --> 25:36.242
I officially call this meeting
of Glee Club in session.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.494
But Mr. Schuester isn't here.
Mr. Schuester
isn't coming.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.997
I paid a freshman
to ask him for help
with irregular verbs.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.626
Ugh! I'm so sick of hearing you
squawk, Eva Perón.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.628
Let her talk.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.840
I have another idea
for the assembly.

25:50.925 --> 25:54.052
Can I, once again, stress my
most strenuous objections to
this attempted suicide?

25:54.136 --> 25:56.971
They're not gonna kill us-
Because we're gonna
give them what they want.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.973
- Blood?
- Better.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.684
Sex.

26:03.145 --> 26:06.814
[Feedback Squeals]
Silence, children.
Silence.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.275
First, an announcement.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.903
The toilets are broken again.

26:11.987 --> 26:15.740
We are fixing the problem.
But let me warn you,

26:15.824 --> 26:20.578
there will be zero tolerance
for anyone soiling
school grounds.

26:20.663 --> 26:23.539
We're not going to have
a repeat of last time.

26:23.624 --> 26:26.876
We have a treat
for you guys today.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.963
- Mr. Schuester.
- Yea, Glee!

26:30.047 --> 26:32.966
- Glee kids, hooray!
- Uh, hi.

26:33.050 --> 26:37.220
Uh, when I went to school here,
Glee Club ruled this place.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.222
And we're on our way back.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.099
But we need some recruits
to join the party.

26:41.183 --> 26:46.562
Now, I could tell you all about
how great Glee is, but, uh,

26:46.647 --> 26:50.024
I think I'm gonna let
some friends of mine
show you instead.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.999
Let me be the one
to break the silence.

29:12.084 --> 29:16.254
That was the most
offensive thing I've seen
in 20 years of teaching-

29:16.338 --> 29:19.298
And that includes
an elementary school
production of Hair.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.593
We've received angry e-mails
from a number
of concerned parents,

29:22.678 --> 29:25.513
many of whom thought
that their children
were going to hear...

29:25.597 --> 29:28.891
a Special Olympian speak
about overcoming adversity.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.144
I-I really don't know
what to say.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.688
Well, let me help you out then.

29:33.772 --> 29:37.692
My first thought was that
your students should be
put into foster care.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.779
But you're the one
who should be punished.

29:41.864 --> 29:44.282
I demand your resignation
from this school,

29:44.366 --> 29:47.702
as well as the disbanding
of Glee Club.

29:47.786 --> 29:51.539
Now, hold on, Sue.
The issue is content.
Those kids are talented.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.625
And I have not seen
the student body this excited...

29:54.710 --> 29:57.545
since Tiffany performed
at the North Hills Mall.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.090
I took the liberty
of calling my pastor...

30:01.175 --> 30:03.676
to provide a list
of family-friendly songs...

30:03.760 --> 30:05.970
that reflect
our community's values.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.556
Your kids can only perform these
preapproved musical selections.

30:08.640 --> 30:13.227
But all these songs have
either "Jesus" or "balloons"
in the title.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.313
But there are also songs
about the circus.

30:15.397 --> 30:19.734
This egg
is sunny-side up, Will.
You need new outfits.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.986
I got several flashes of panty
from your group today,

30:22.070 --> 30:24.572
and I'm not talking
about the girls.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.408
So, Sue, I'm cutting
your dry-cleaning budget...

30:27.493 --> 30:29.827
to pay for new costumes
for the Glee Club.

30:29.912 --> 30:33.372
- This will not stand.
- Oh, Sue.

30:33.457 --> 30:36.375
The dry-cleaners here
are just as good
as the ones in Europe.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.638
Mr. Schuester, I'm so sorry.
Do you understand
what you did today?

30:48.722 --> 30:50.681
You lied to me.
And you ruined our chances.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.601
No parent in their right mind
is gonna let their kid
join Glee now.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.187
Oh, and, uh,
here's a list of the songs
that we're allowed to sing.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.356
What's a "Luftballon"?

30:58.440 --> 31:00.942
Look, I know how much
you care about Glee Club,

31:01.026 --> 31:03.653
and I understand why
you did what you did,

31:03.737 --> 31:06.781
but I don't like
the way you did it.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.804
They're for Tulip-A-Looza.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.889
It's a tulip festival down at
the Columbus Convention Center.

31:31.974 --> 31:34.392
- It's supposed to smell pretty nice.
- That's really sweet of you,

31:34.476 --> 31:37.144
but I have... a-asthma.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.148
What are you doing?
Chasing a married guy.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.902
I saw you playing house
with him after hours, Emma.

31:44.987 --> 31:48.739
Look. I don't know a lot
about relationships.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.200
Most of mine are short and
flame out once the sex goes,

31:51.285 --> 31:53.494
but I do know you never want
to be the rebounder.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.248
I'm a good man, Emma.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.667
I'll treat you right.
I'll put up with
all your crazy.

They can't fire me
'cause I'm a minority,

32:01.920 --> 32:03.629
so I'll always be able
to provide for you.

you're not gonna
do much better.

for a baritenor,
so it's a good note.

All right,
I'll start at the bottom,
and then we'll go up higher.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.243
Can we take a break?
Singing kind of
makes me a little hungry.

32:34.328 --> 32:37.330
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Lucky I prepared for that.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.665

what that was all about.

to help you with your singing.

at the assembly.

my only chance to be,
you know, good like you.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.101
You think I'm good?

32:59.186 --> 33:01.604
Well, when I first joined,
I thought you were
kind of insane.

33:01.688 --> 33:04.106
You talk a lot more
than you should,
and to be honest with you,

33:04.191 --> 33:08.235
I looked under the bed
and made sure that you weren't
hanging out under there.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.530
But then I heard you sing.

33:11.615 --> 33:15.034
I don't know how to say this,
but you touched something in me.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.569
Well, cheers.
Cheers.

[Chuckles]

33:57.494 --> 33:59.412
Oh, you got
a little Cosmo right-

34:05.711 --> 34:08.462
You know, you can kiss me
if you want to.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.050
I want to.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.866
What?

Oh, my God!

34:39.911 --> 34:42.163
[Groans]
Did I do something wrong?

34:42.247 --> 34:44.540
No, no.
Um, I just gotta go.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.668
Look, please don't tell anybody
about this, okay?

34:58.430 --> 35:00.723
I don't want my baby to grow
an extra arm just because...

35:00.807 --> 35:03.100
I lived in squalor
and I'm so stressed.

35:03.185 --> 35:05.770
So, I want you to run any
and all tests you have.

35:05.896 --> 35:08.898
Trust me. You're clear.
Are you sure?

35:08.982 --> 35:11.901
- Positive.
- Is it a boy or a girl?

35:11.985 --> 35:13.903
Um-

35:15.197 --> 35:18.073
Don't quite know
how to put this.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.826
- There's no baby.
- Did it fall out?

35:20.911 --> 35:22.495
[Chuckles]

35:22.579 --> 35:25.289
Uh, no.
Uh, you're not pregnant.

35:25.415 --> 35:28.167
But I've gained 10 pounds.
It's probably from eating.

35:28.251 --> 35:31.086
I can see a chicken wing
in there that you must
have swallowed whole.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.380
You're having what's called
a hysterical pregnancy.

35:33.465 --> 35:38.052
You want a baby
so badly that your body
mimics the symptoms.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.183
If you’re meant
to get pregnant,
it'll happen.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.022
[Groans]

35:53.068 --> 35:56.028
I have to say,
I'm really surprised
you guys are trying out.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.364
I'm sure you've
read about this
in the school paper.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.825
Finn and I have been
an item for a while now.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.161
So what kind of girlfriend
would I be if I didn't
support him?

36:04.246 --> 36:06.872

37:01.261 --> 37:03.095
I'm sorry, Coach Sylvester,

37:03.179 --> 37:05.764
but something is going on
between Finn and that thing.

37:05.849 --> 37:09.310
You saw how it was
undressing him
with its eyes.

kick us off the Cheerios.
[Snaps Finger]

I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to see it.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.985
You know, Q, when I first
laid eyes on you,

37:18.069 --> 37:20.613
I was reminded of a young
Sue Sylvester,

37:20.697 --> 37:22.865
though you don't have
my bone structure.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.618
But it wasn't until
this very moment,

37:26.620 --> 37:29.038
I saw how alike we really are.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.542
You three are going to be
my spies.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.920
I need eyes on the inside.

Hey, Emma. Guess what.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.109
I found these new

38:08.787 --> 38:11.997
I mean,
you're having a baby.

38:13.875 --> 38:17.419
Um, and anyway, uh-

38:17.545 --> 38:20.005
I have a date.
Oh, that's great.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.591
Yeah.
Yeah. With who?

38:22.676 --> 38:24.969
I'm gonna go
to Tulip-A-Looza.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.012
With Ken.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.409
There's my man.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.453
Bringing home the bacon.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.747
You- You made dinner.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.749
I thought you'd be asleep.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.168
Well, I wanted to talk
to you about something,

38:58.253 --> 39:01.922
so I made you
chicken pot pie-
from scratch.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.258
[Chuckles]

39:04.342 --> 39:06.760
Terri, that's so thoughtful. I-

39:08.263 --> 39:10.597
Yeah, you know, I've been
working so hard lately, some-

39:10.682 --> 39:12.933
Sometimes I forget
what I'm doing it for.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.644
Family's what's important to me.

39:15.729 --> 39:19.481
You and the little guy or gal
on the way.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.443
I hope you know that.
Yeah.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.738
I'm sorry. What was it
you wanted to talk about?

39:26.781 --> 39:28.741
I went to
the baby doctor today.

39:28.867 --> 39:32.411
And?
And...

39:34.122 --> 39:36.457
it's a boy.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.461
Oh, my God.
Terri, that's amazing.
Yeah.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.963
Oh, my God. Oh!

39:44.007 --> 39:46.175
Uh, I want you to give up
being a janitor.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.927
What?
Yeah. We don't need
a new house.

39:49.012 --> 39:50.929
We'll turn my craft room
into a nursery.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.849
It's a compromise
that I want to make.
Really?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.934
Yeah.

39:56.019 --> 39:59.938
You know, the only
project that I want
to work on now is us.

40:02.192 --> 40:04.151
I love you so much.

You're giving Quinn Fabray
the solo? That's my solo.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.751
You made this happen, Rachel.
You were the one who wanted
to sell sex at the assembly.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.295
Quinn's audition song was
on Figgins's approved list,

40:23.421 --> 40:26.381
and frankly, she did
a heck of a job singing it.
You're punishing me.

40:26.466 --> 40:30.135
Contrary to your beliefs,
it's not all about you.

40:31.179 --> 40:34.348
Or, I've realized, about me.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.267
Look, I screwed up too.

40:37.352 --> 40:40.354
I'm as responsible
for what you did at
that assembly as you are.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.439
I should never
have pushed disco so hard.

40:42.524 --> 40:44.942
When we did it back in '93,

40:45.026 --> 40:47.653
the disco revival
was in its heyday.

40:47.737 --> 40:50.072
It was cool. We had fun.

40:50.156 --> 40:54.076
And that- That is what Glee
is supposed to be about.

40:54.160 --> 40:58.872
If we’re gonna succeed,
we both need to change
our mind sets.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.375
You're not always
gonna be the star.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.670
But I promise to do my best
to make sure you're
always having fun.

41:04.754 --> 41:06.922
This is a good thing,
Rachel.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.216
We're on our way.

41:10.260 --> 41:13.095
Can I use the auditorium later
to practice?

41:13.179 --> 41:15.264

are filing a lawsuit.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.182
