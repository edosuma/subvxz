<i>[ Man Narrating ]</i>
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel</i>

00:03.827 --> 00:07.558
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett led an elite group</i>

she could see me.

it was gonna be easy being a mother.

you gotta figure out why your 1 5-year-old

anything to do with sex.

12:19.862 --> 12:22.228
Well, of course it--
What else could it be about?

12:22.298 --> 12:24.562
<i>Lots of things.</i>
<i>I mean, when I was 1 5, I had</i>--

12:24.633 --> 12:26.624
I had trouble because
I was smart and shy.

The kid is funny.
He's not Einstein.
<i>Maybe it's a cover.</i>

12:30.639 --> 12:33.403
Maybe he's using humor
to hide his emotions.

No.

Besides, I think he likes the girl.

16:33.983 --> 16:37.441

Well, he defended her honor.

16:37.519 --> 16:41.182
