WEBVTT

00:03.087 --> 00:05.345
I'm ready for
the movies, lamb chop.

00:05.381 --> 00:06.555
You gonna treat your grandma?

00:06.590 --> 00:08.765
Uh, I would but, uh,

00:08.800 --> 00:10.975
I'm a little short.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.129
Yeah... ( clears throat )
Too easy.

00:14.164 --> 00:16.790
Don't worry, baby.
It's Grandma's treat.

00:16.825 --> 00:19.134
Cheap just like his daddy.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.661
You wanna come
with us, chickpea?

00:21.697 --> 00:24.648
Um, I would, but I gotta write my
trailblazer report for school.

00:24.683 --> 00:25.843
I'm writing about
Christopher Columbus

00:25.867 --> 00:27.909
but I'm just not feeling it.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.595
It's like saying,
"Congrats, Chris."

00:29.630 --> 00:31.321
You discovered a brand-new world

00:31.398 --> 00:33.474
that is already filled
with people lookin' at you

00:33.509 --> 00:35.033
"like, who the heck is this guy."

00:35.069 --> 00:38.086
( laughter )

00:38.121 --> 00:40.658
- It would be like me discovering this pie.
- Hey, that's my pie.

00:40.682 --> 00:42.074
Then what's it doing
in my mouth?

00:44.402 --> 00:47.787
I would much rather be writing
about a real trailblazer

00:47.823 --> 00:50.315
like... like you, Grandma.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.818
The first female black spy
in the Organization.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.729
What in the Harry Potter
are you talking about?

00:55.764 --> 00:58.006
I wasn't the first.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.799
Cleo Brown was.

00:59.835 --> 01:02.227
Uh, speaking of firsts,

01:02.304 --> 01:05.230
did you know a black man
invented the traffic light?

01:05.265 --> 01:07.115
Why don't we pay homage to him

01:07.151 --> 01:09.642
as you drive me to the movies?

01:09.678 --> 01:11.719
Hold your horses, potato chip.

01:11.755 --> 01:13.931
Which, FYI, was also
created by a black man.

01:13.966 --> 01:16.032
That sour cream
and onion flavor?

01:16.068 --> 01:17.192
White folks.

01:19.488 --> 01:21.622
So if Cleo Brown was the first,

01:21.657 --> 01:23.059
then how come
I've never heard of her?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.042
Probably because
it happened in the '70s.

01:25.077 --> 01:28.044
Back then, it was hard
for any woman to get ahead.

01:28.079 --> 01:29.679
But a black woman? Forget it.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.039
Sister couldn't catch a break.

01:31.075 --> 01:33.208
But I bet they
could catch a movie,

01:33.243 --> 01:34.645
which means they're
doing better than me.

01:34.669 --> 01:37.453
For your information,

01:37.489 --> 01:39.672
back then, there was
no glass ceiling for us.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.858
It was made of concrete.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.121
Maybe that's why
they wore the big Afros,

01:43.145 --> 01:45.629
to soften the bump.

01:45.664 --> 01:47.647
Oh, but Cleo changed
all of that.

01:47.682 --> 01:49.532
She was kinda like you.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.893
Smarter than a set
of encyclopedias,

01:51.929 --> 01:54.020
those long, pencil legs,

01:54.055 --> 01:56.098
and a smile bigger
than the Mississippi.

01:56.133 --> 01:58.717
She was a bad mama jamma.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.061
¶ She's the baddest of the bad ¶

02:01.096 --> 02:03.321
¶ The toughest of the tough ¶

02:03.356 --> 02:06.708
¶ She's Cleo Brown
and she don't take no stuff ¶

02:06.743 --> 02:09.744
¶ Cleo, Cleo Brown ¶

02:12.015 --> 02:15.108
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

02:15.143 --> 02:18.262
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

02:18.338 --> 02:22.257
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

02:22.292 --> 02:26.027
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:26.063 --> 02:29.773
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:29.808 --> 02:32.116
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:32.152 --> 02:36.146
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:36.181 --> 02:40.083
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:40.119 --> 02:42.152
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:42.187 --> 02:44.179
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:44.214 --> 02:46.656
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:46.692 --> 02:48.725
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:48.760 --> 02:50.611
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:50.646 --> 02:52.812
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:52.847 --> 02:55.490
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:55.525 --> 02:56.841
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:56.876 --> 02:58.952
I keep it undercover.

02:58.987 --> 02:59.987
I keep it undercover.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.517
Grandma, you gotta talk.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.104
I need to know more
about this Cleo Brown.

03:07.128 --> 03:09.654
Okay, okay, now calm down,
baba ganoush.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.748
Okay, let me start
at the beginning.

03:11.784 --> 03:14.142
The year was 1974.

03:14.178 --> 03:17.078
Nixon was just about to resign,

03:17.114 --> 03:19.956
the Sky Lab
was orbiting the Earth,

03:19.992 --> 03:22.384
and the world was changing.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.886
And Cleo Brown
was right smack dab

03:24.921 --> 03:27.706
in the middle of the storm.

03:27.783 --> 03:30.558
<i>Now the woman's movement
was well underway,</i>

03:30.593 --> 03:32.653
<i>but we have a long way to go.</i>

03:32.688 --> 03:35.221
<i>Cleo Brown was a secretary,</i>

03:35.257 --> 03:36.551
<i>which is fine if
that's what you wanna do.</i>

03:36.575 --> 03:38.408
<i>But she wanted more.</i>

03:38.443 --> 03:40.118
Agent Ballard,
I took the liberty

03:40.154 --> 03:43.204
of doing a little research
for your mission to Bahrain.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.750
As is custom, you will have to
burp after every meal

03:44.774 --> 03:47.534
in order to show
your appreciation of the host.

03:47.569 --> 03:48.218
If you don't burp,
you will blow your cover.

03:48.253 --> 03:50.804
( Burps loudly )

03:50.839 --> 03:53.273
You're welcome.

03:53.308 --> 03:54.785
And in other news,
it's tuna casserole

03:54.809 --> 03:55.976
in the cafeteria today.

03:58.763 --> 04:01.056
I don't understand
why you work so hard.

04:01.091 --> 04:03.299
We don't have to be
good at this.

04:03.334 --> 04:04.520
We just have to be here
long enough

04:04.544 --> 04:07.036
to make a man fall in love
with us so we can get married.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.406
Hi, Harvey.

04:11.493 --> 04:13.168
'Cause I love spy work.

04:13.203 --> 04:15.353
The challenge, the excitement.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.164
Cleo, stop dreaming about
your silly career,

04:18.199 --> 04:20.508
and start dreaming about
changing diapers.

04:20.543 --> 04:22.393
Changing diapers is your dream?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.638
Because that is my nightmare.

04:24.715 --> 04:26.907
There is more to life
than marriage and babies.

04:26.942 --> 04:29.760
Not according to
<i>Marriage and Babies Digest.</i>

04:29.795 --> 04:31.361
Can I see that?

04:31.396 --> 04:32.762
Oh, sure.

04:32.797 --> 04:34.998
Ow!

04:35.033 --> 04:37.633
Girl, get it together;
It is 1974.

04:37.669 --> 04:39.314
I don't know about you,
but I wanna grab the brass ring

04:39.338 --> 04:42.405
and live the thrilling
life I was meant to.

04:42.441 --> 04:44.544
- Where's my coffee?
- Right after I grab Agent Whitman his coffee.

04:44.568 --> 04:46.026
Coming, sir.

04:48.546 --> 04:50.496
Here you go, Mr. Whitman.

04:50.532 --> 04:51.532
Thanks, hon.

04:54.236 --> 04:56.603
Her boss called her hon?

04:56.638 --> 04:58.379
Well, baby, that's
the way it was back then.

04:58.414 --> 05:00.098
What's wrong with hon?

05:00.134 --> 05:02.308
It's condescending,
it's belittling.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.255
It's like saying a woman's
name isn't worth remembering.

05:04.279 --> 05:05.945
How would you like it
if I called you hon?

05:05.980 --> 05:07.680
Compared to what you
usually call me,

05:07.715 --> 05:09.198
it would be a step up.

05:09.234 --> 05:11.059
I see your point.

05:11.095 --> 05:13.303
Sorry, hon.

05:13.338 --> 05:16.064
All right, agents.
We have a new mission.

05:16.099 --> 05:17.579
( Snaps fingers )
Hon, get the lights.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.312
Based on intel we just received,

05:22.347 --> 05:24.306
there's a brand-new
group of subversives

05:24.341 --> 05:26.599
calling themselves
the Other Side.

05:26.634 --> 05:29.711
Relax.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.122
Chances are, we'll be able
to take care of them quickly,

05:32.157 --> 05:33.637
and they'll never
be heard from again.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.462
Meanwhile, we suspect they're
using a local discotheque

05:39.497 --> 05:41.840
as a front to print
counterfeit money.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.355
( Snaps fingers )
Hon, get the lights.

05:47.155 --> 05:49.255
Now as soon as our informant
Smitty tells us

05:49.291 --> 05:51.299
the location of the discotheque,

05:51.334 --> 05:53.301
we'll move in.

05:53.336 --> 05:57.321
We need someone cool
and hip to blend in

05:57.357 --> 05:59.257
with the glamorous
discotheque crowd.

05:59.293 --> 06:02.936
Henrietta, you haven't been
on a mission for a while.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.396
You're our gal.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.125
Yes, hon?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.669
Actually, it's Cleo.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.499
Um, I just wanted to say
to Henrietta,

06:15.501 --> 06:18.534
you are an amazing agent
and a total pioneer, girl,

06:18.569 --> 06:21.396
but, um, I just think
I'm a bit more...

06:21.431 --> 06:23.949
well, disco-ier than she is,

06:23.984 --> 06:25.466
and a better fit
for this mission.

06:25.502 --> 06:28.161
( laughing )

06:28.196 --> 06:30.922
You wanna go on a mission?

06:30.958 --> 06:33.650
Well, yeah. I'm the right age.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.727
I watch<i> Soul Train,</i>
so I know all the new dances.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.753
The Bus Stop, the Robot,

06:37.789 --> 06:40.323
and my Funky Chicken
is the funkiest in town.

06:40.359 --> 06:44.702
Cleo, I'm as progressive
as the next guy,

06:44.738 --> 06:46.554
but I can't put you
on this mission.

06:46.589 --> 06:48.448
Why not?

06:48.483 --> 06:50.041
Because you're a woman.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.093
Henrietta's a woman.

06:52.128 --> 06:54.905
Well, yeah, but you're...

06:54.940 --> 06:56.840
You're, um...

06:56.875 --> 06:58.199
I'm what?

07:00.545 --> 07:01.911
You're a secretary.

07:04.116 --> 07:06.249
Now why don't you act like one,

07:06.284 --> 07:08.284
and get me a doughnut.
Can you handle that mission?

07:13.225 --> 07:14.766
I am so angry, I could pop.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.561
I went in there and volunteered
to be on a mission,

07:17.563 --> 07:19.023
and they practically
laughed me out of the room.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.748
You really don't want
a husband, do you?

07:21.783 --> 07:24.467
You might as well walk around
here in boring clothing

07:24.502 --> 07:26.644
and no makeup and... never mind.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.758
Oh, now, sweetie, are you okay?

07:31.793 --> 07:34.544
What the heck
is wrong with you?!

07:34.580 --> 07:37.180
Keep this up and you're
gonna get us both fired.

07:37.215 --> 07:39.474
Power to you, but I can't
get caught up in your mess.

07:39.509 --> 07:42.252
Girl, I got four kids,
one of 'em need braces,

07:42.287 --> 07:44.654
and I'm saving up for a car.

07:44.689 --> 07:46.656
And how would I get
us both fired?

07:46.691 --> 07:48.967
Now you know good and well

07:49.002 --> 07:52.587
they can't tell
us<i> secretaries</i> apart.

07:54.382 --> 07:56.482
Then why don't you go in there

07:56.518 --> 07:58.192
and give Agent Whitman
his doughnut?

07:58.228 --> 08:00.044
Because if I go back in there,

08:00.080 --> 08:02.571
I'm gonna shove it
down his doughnut hole.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.832
Cleo, why are you
rockin' the boat?

08:04.867 --> 08:06.592
Now just stay in your place.

08:06.628 --> 08:10.914
My place? I don't have
to stay in my place.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.243
This isn't the olden days when you had
to be afraid to step out of line.

08:12.267 --> 08:15.168
This is 1974.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.770
A black woman ran for president
of the United States.

08:17.806 --> 08:20.765
Now, granted, barely
anybody voted for her,

08:20.800 --> 08:22.558
but you know what, she ran.

08:22.593 --> 08:25.420
So now you think
you Shirley Chisholm?

08:25.455 --> 08:27.739
Girl, you ain't even
Shirley Temple Black.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.951
No, I'm Cleo, Cleo Brown.

08:30.986 --> 08:32.610
I just want
the same opportunities

08:32.645 --> 08:33.931
to succeed as anyone
else in here.

08:33.955 --> 08:35.355
( Phone rings )

08:35.390 --> 08:38.308
( sighs )

08:38.343 --> 08:40.702
Hello. Agent Whitman's office.

08:40.737 --> 08:43.154
Yes, this is Cleo speaking.
Oh, hi, Smitty.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.997
It's the informant.

08:45.033 --> 08:47.642
Uh, you know what?

08:47.677 --> 08:49.163
Agent Whitman
is in a meeting right now.

08:49.187 --> 08:51.237
Can I take a message?

08:51.272 --> 08:55.408
The Xenon discotheque.

08:55.443 --> 08:56.876
All right, I'll let him know.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.135
Thank you.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.355
( Clears throat )

09:00.390 --> 09:02.949
The Xenon. Interesting.

09:02.984 --> 09:07.312
Cleo Brown, you are
workin' my last nerve.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.806
Now go in there and give
Whitman that message.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.800
I could, and he could say, "Thanks, hon.
Go get me another coffee,"

09:12.836 --> 09:15.194
or I could go to the Xenon,
complete the mission by myself,

09:15.229 --> 09:16.249
and prove that I have
what it takes

09:16.273 --> 09:18.072
to be a real spy.

09:18.107 --> 09:19.227
Now I'm taking this mission.

09:21.252 --> 09:22.719
( Paper drops )

09:25.632 --> 09:26.681
I forgot I burnt my bra.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.319
This story's getting good.

09:31.354 --> 09:33.254
Because she said bra?

09:33.289 --> 09:36.808
No. Because this brave woman

09:36.843 --> 09:39.627
had the courage
to prove her worth

09:39.663 --> 09:42.705
in a society that
undervalued her contributions

09:42.740 --> 09:45.083
simply because of
the color of her skin.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.160
- And because she said bra.
- ( giggles ) Yeah.

09:53.868 --> 09:57.003
So let me guess.

09:57.038 --> 09:57.762
Cleo Brown went behind the Organization's
back, completed the mission,

09:57.797 --> 10:00.398
they say how amazing she was
and made her an agent.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.483
Excuse me.
Who's telling this story?

10:02.519 --> 10:04.577
Right now, no one.
Come on, Grandma.

10:04.612 --> 10:06.904
You can't leave
a chickpea hangin'.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.916
Okay. So that night,
Cleo convinced her friends

10:09.951 --> 10:11.309
to go with her
to the discotheque.

10:18.435 --> 10:19.817
I can't believe I let Cleo Brown

10:19.852 --> 10:23.838
talk me into helping her
on some crazy secret mission.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.749
Secret mission? She told
me this was a fix-up.

10:26.784 --> 10:29.218
I hope no one sees me here.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.329
I cannot afford to get fired.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.891
I got four kids,
one of 'em need braces,

10:32.915 --> 10:35.182
and I'm savin' up for a car.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.335
Well, I hope no one
sees me here either.

10:37.370 --> 10:41.030
How pathetic, being out on
the town without a date.

10:41.065 --> 10:44.183
I don't wanna seem desperate.

10:44.219 --> 10:47.237
Said the girl who tells first dates
she already has a wedding dress.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.255
That is not desperate.

10:49.290 --> 10:50.515
That is prepared.

10:55.439 --> 10:57.547
Not you two.

10:57.582 --> 10:59.156
What the heck
are you lookin' at?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.375
Jive turkey!

11:01.411 --> 11:03.903
What, so you sayin' we not
cool and hip enough

11:03.938 --> 11:06.139
for this club?

11:06.174 --> 11:08.240
Just for that,
I'm not offering you

11:08.276 --> 11:09.516
a bite of my meatloaf sandwich.

11:11.762 --> 11:14.230
Don't tell me
I'm not cool and hip.

11:14.265 --> 11:16.491
¶ She's the baddest of the bad ¶

11:16.526 --> 11:18.751
¶ The toughest of the tough ¶

11:18.786 --> 11:22.763
¶ She's Cleo Brown
and she don't take no stuff ¶

11:22.798 --> 11:26.684
¶ Cleo, Cleo Brown ¶

11:26.719 --> 11:28.894
What the heck was that?

11:28.930 --> 11:31.580
Oh, it's Cleo!

11:31.615 --> 11:32.890
( Deep voice ) Cleo Brown!

11:35.478 --> 11:36.736
How you feelin', ladies?

11:36.772 --> 11:38.680
You're late.

11:38.715 --> 11:40.723
I may be late, but I am right...

11:40.758 --> 11:43.334
on time.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.370
Well, actually, you're not.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.205
But regardless,
they're not letting us in.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.348
You are with Cleo Brown.

11:49.383 --> 11:50.742
They'll let us in. Ya dig?

11:54.289 --> 11:55.838
Come on in.

11:55.873 --> 11:57.123
Baby, I'm already in.

12:04.449 --> 12:06.369
GRANDMA: <i>And spinnin' on
the turntables that night</i>

12:06.393 --> 12:09.761
was the coolest deejay
who ever lived.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.188
DJ Funky Wonder.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.140
Grandma Gayle, did
DJ Funky Wonder look like me?

12:17.545 --> 12:19.003
<i>Uh, no, fluffernutter.</i>

12:19.039 --> 12:20.955
<i>Not even a little?</i>

12:20.990 --> 12:23.166
<i>Sorry, soda pop.</i>

12:23.201 --> 12:24.400
<i>Can he look like me?</i>

12:24.435 --> 12:26.085
<i>Ugh! Fine.</i>

12:26.120 --> 12:27.903
( feedback whines )

12:27.939 --> 12:29.989
Are you ready to get on down?

12:33.495 --> 12:35.335
Right on, right on.
Are you ready to get on up?

12:37.966 --> 12:41.392
You're rockin' with
DJ Funky Wonder.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.619
I'm gonna make you
boogie-oogie-oogie

12:43.655 --> 12:45.295
until you just can't
boogie no more, baby.

12:48.075 --> 12:49.075
Boogie.

12:54.865 --> 12:56.724
Come on, ladies.
You gotta loosen up.

12:56.759 --> 12:58.459
We gotta blend in.
We're on a mission here.

12:58.494 --> 13:00.178
No, you're on a mission here.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.954
I need to be home.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.580
I got four kids,
one of 'em need braces,

13:03.616 --> 13:05.649
and I'm savin' up for a car.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.511
Yes, you have mentioned that.

13:08.546 --> 13:11.213
If you ask me, I'd just
buy the car,

13:11.248 --> 13:12.593
and tell that kid of yours
to smile with his mouth closed.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.184
Yeah, Carol.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.520
Be cool.

13:17.555 --> 13:19.247
Don't be all, like, uncool.

13:27.524 --> 13:29.682
All right, ladies,

13:29.717 --> 13:33.260
I'm gonna groove my way
to the back room

13:33.296 --> 13:34.515
and see if I can get a picture of the
counterfeiting machine on my Afro camera.

13:34.539 --> 13:36.947
Oh, what's an Afro camera?

13:36.983 --> 13:39.517
It's a camera in my Afro.

13:45.683 --> 13:47.678
Now all I gotta do is take a picture
of the counterfeiting machine,

13:47.702 --> 13:49.977
send it in to the drugstore,

13:50.013 --> 13:51.432
wait a couple of weeks
for it to come back,

13:51.456 --> 13:52.914
then show it to Agent Whitman.

13:52.949 --> 13:54.690
Then he'll come down here
to the disco,

13:54.726 --> 13:56.626
and bust 'em cold stone
and then, shablooya!

13:56.661 --> 13:59.136
I will be Agent Cleo Brown
in no time.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.731
Well, a little bit of time,
but you know what.

14:01.766 --> 14:03.886
I've waited a year, so I can
wait a couple more weeks.

14:16.597 --> 14:19.182
GRANDMA: <i>Now don't ask me how,</i>

14:19.217 --> 14:21.417
<i>but Cleo shimmied her way
into the bowels of the club.</i>

14:29.778 --> 14:32.127
"TNT Boom."

14:32.163 --> 14:33.763
MAN: It's right here
in the storage room.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.094
Okay, Skully, we're almost
finished pressing the LP's.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.663
We definitely shipping tonight?

14:42.699 --> 14:44.406
Yep, and no one will ever guess

14:44.442 --> 14:46.918
the albums are actually
made out of dynamite.

14:46.953 --> 14:50.312
Ho! ( Laughs )

14:50.347 --> 14:52.067
The records will soon be in
the hands of the Other Side.

14:52.091 --> 14:55.526
Hopefully soon, some bread
will be in my hands.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.761
Ah, yeah, about that.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.406
( laughing )
What was he thinking?

15:01.442 --> 15:03.376
I make records out of dynamite.

15:03.411 --> 15:04.894
Did he really
expect me to pay him?

15:06.489 --> 15:09.015
Clean up this mess.

15:09.050 --> 15:11.025
And try not to blow anything up.

15:22.705 --> 15:24.371
I'm starting to think

15:24.406 --> 15:26.482
I should've let
Henrietta do this mission.

15:26.517 --> 15:28.637
I wonder if it's too late
to cram her into a tube top.

15:40.798 --> 15:44.191
Oh, hey, Cleo.

15:44.227 --> 15:46.263
Hey. It turns out there's some
pretty crazy stuff goin' on here.

15:46.287 --> 15:48.513
Tell me about it.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.033
This disco music
is out of sight.

15:52.068 --> 15:54.101
Turns out you can dance
all by yourself.

15:54.137 --> 15:56.704
I'm telling you,
this music has changed me.

15:56.739 --> 15:58.806
I don't need
a man to dance with.

15:58.841 --> 16:01.008
I don't need a man at all.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.905
That's too bad, because
there's a guy over there

16:02.929 --> 16:04.520
checking you out.

16:04.556 --> 16:06.497
I don't even care.

16:08.809 --> 16:10.101
Why you dancin' over to him?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.929
It's a coincidence.

16:12.964 --> 16:14.688
Cleo, did you get
the picture you need?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.616
I got the pictures, all right.

16:16.651 --> 16:19.059
Turns out they're making
records out of dynamite.

16:19.095 --> 16:20.581
I need to tell Agent Whitman so he
can come down here and handle it.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.814
So he can handle it?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.665
Cleo, I thought
this was your mission.

16:24.700 --> 16:27.668
This is the chance
you've been dreaming about.

16:27.703 --> 16:29.372
You will never be able
to live with yourself

16:29.396 --> 16:30.371
unless you complete it.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.739
( Feedback whines )

16:31.774 --> 16:33.841
Hey, hey, party people.

16:33.876 --> 16:35.893
I was just in the back room,

16:35.928 --> 16:37.561
and stumbled across a new record

16:37.597 --> 16:40.022
from a band I've never heard of
called TNT.

16:40.057 --> 16:42.808
Their new single's
called "Boom."

16:42.843 --> 16:44.944
Let's see if it
blows us away, baby.

16:44.979 --> 16:47.121
Oh, it will blow us away,

16:47.156 --> 16:48.981
as soon as he
puts it on the turntable.

16:49.017 --> 16:51.850
It's made out of dynamite. We
need to get outta here right now.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.905
Or you can finish
what you started.

16:55.940 --> 17:00.234
Now all you foxy ladies
and cool cats,

17:00.270 --> 17:03.045
let's get ready to groove
to "Boom."

17:03.081 --> 17:04.872
No! You can't play that record.
It's a bomb.

17:04.907 --> 17:07.875
At least give it
a chance, lollipop.

17:07.910 --> 17:11.145
For all you know,
it could be... dyn-o-mite.

17:49.511 --> 17:51.868
You may be bad, but I'm badder.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.963
I am bad, bad Cleo Brown.

17:53.998 --> 17:56.057
¶ She's the baddest of the bad ¶

17:56.092 --> 17:58.409
¶ The toughest of the tough ¶

17:58.411 --> 18:02.413
¶ She's Cleo Brown,
and she don't take no stuff ¶

18:02.448 --> 18:05.241
¶ Cleo, Cleo Brown ¶

18:07.253 --> 18:09.069
Grandma Gayle,
I don't want you to think

18:09.105 --> 18:11.547
that I'm accusing you
of stretching the truth,

18:11.582 --> 18:14.166
but I just flat out
don't believe you.

18:15.978 --> 18:17.970
I mean, how did Cleo Brown,

18:18.005 --> 18:20.105
who had never been
on a mission before,

18:20.141 --> 18:22.424
and was basically ready
to run through the door,

18:22.459 --> 18:24.296
all of a sudden beat the snot
out of 20 bad guys?

18:24.320 --> 18:25.697
Ten, 20, 30, I don't know
the exact number.

18:25.721 --> 18:27.630
I ain't no accountant.

18:27.665 --> 18:29.890
But she did save the day,

18:29.925 --> 18:32.092
and there's a whole lot
more to the story.

18:32.128 --> 18:34.061
But first, I gotta take
a little nappy nap.

18:34.096 --> 18:36.105
- BOTH: No!
- I'm just yankin' your chain.

18:39.026 --> 18:40.709
Okay, so anyway, the next day,

18:40.745 --> 18:42.105
it was right back
to work for Cleo.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.356
Cleo, can I see you
in the conference room, please?

18:48.311 --> 18:50.210
Okay, this is it.
Go get 'em, Agent Brown.

18:50.245 --> 18:52.697
I am so proud of you.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.206
¶ You're getting
your promotion ¶

19:05.436 --> 19:07.077
I see you have
a bruise on your chin.

19:07.112 --> 19:09.096
Well, you should see
the other guys.

19:09.131 --> 19:10.534
In fact, in two weeks,
when the pictures

19:10.558 --> 19:13.551
come back from the drugstore,
you will be able to.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.994
Cleo, I'm furious with you.

19:16.030 --> 19:19.389
I think what you mean is,
good work.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.451
You broke every rule in the
book going on that mission.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.813
I think what you meant
to say is I proved myself.

19:25.848 --> 19:27.181
I proved that I am
just as capable

19:27.216 --> 19:29.483
as anybody in this office.

19:29.518 --> 19:30.860
I deserve to be an agent.

19:30.895 --> 19:33.762
No. You deserve to be fired!

19:33.798 --> 19:35.047
But I'm gonna spare your job,

19:35.082 --> 19:37.974
because you have four kids,
one of 'em needs braces,

19:38.010 --> 19:39.130
and you're saving for a car.

19:47.712 --> 19:50.930
That is not me!

19:53.042 --> 19:55.834
Look, I'm gonna do you
a big favor,

19:55.869 --> 19:58.387
keep this whole mess
off your record,

19:58.422 --> 20:00.039
because you're a good girl.

20:00.074 --> 20:03.325
First off,

20:03.360 --> 20:05.160
I am not a girl. I am a woman.

20:05.195 --> 20:07.738
Secondly, I am not good.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.474
I am bad. Bad, bad Cleo Brown!

20:10.509 --> 20:12.485
And last but
definitely not least,

20:12.520 --> 20:14.153
I will do us both a favor.

20:14.188 --> 20:15.954
I quit!

20:15.990 --> 20:17.957
You got that... <i>hon?</i>

20:23.130 --> 20:25.172
Everybody back to work.

20:25.207 --> 20:26.623
( Phone rings )

20:26.658 --> 20:27.975
Hello.

20:28.011 --> 20:30.378
Hi, Charlie.

20:30.413 --> 20:32.797
A date tonight?
I don't think so.

20:32.832 --> 20:37.234
I am going disco dancing
by myself.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.553
Oh, and another thing.

20:39.588 --> 20:41.855
I'm letting
my underarm hair grow!

20:44.952 --> 20:47.235
I want a promotion.

20:47.271 --> 20:50.114
I wanna apply to become a spy.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.149
Aren't you supposed
to be making coffee?

20:52.184 --> 20:55.828
I have made enough coffee.

21:03.412 --> 21:05.404
Wait. So Cleo Brown
rocked the mission,

21:05.439 --> 21:08.257
saved hundreds of people
from a disco inferno,

21:08.292 --> 21:11.793
and still never officially
became a spy?

21:11.829 --> 21:14.046
What the heck kinda female
empowerment story is that?

21:14.081 --> 21:17.132
The kind we had
in the '70s, baby.

21:17.168 --> 21:21.027
But if you allow me
to finish, ramen noodle,

21:21.063 --> 21:25.248
Cleo did go on to start her own
successful detective agency.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.743
And Cleo's lesson
was our blessing.

21:27.778 --> 21:29.678
Because after that,
the powers that be

21:29.713 --> 21:32.272
saw that black women
could do any job

21:32.308 --> 21:34.591
just as well as anybody else,
if not better.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.611
And we began to get promoted.

21:37.647 --> 21:41.273
And<i> that</i> is the story
of Cleo Brown.

21:41.308 --> 21:42.833
You ready to go
to the movies, hon?

21:42.868 --> 21:45.377
No!

21:45.412 --> 21:47.638
I'm too upset about
what happened to Cleo.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.081
And don't call me hon.

21:49.116 --> 21:53.302
Well, I'm glad
you liked the story.

21:53.337 --> 21:56.622
You know, we should
know about our past.

21:56.657 --> 21:59.574
It's just a shame that
Cleo didn't get her due.

21:59.610 --> 22:02.369
Too bad there's nothing
we can do to change it.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.438
Or can we?

22:08.594 --> 22:10.644
Cleo Brown kicked down the doors

22:10.680 --> 22:12.754
so that my Grandma Gayle
could become a spy.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.140
My Grandma Gayle
fought discrimination

22:15.175 --> 22:17.209
with her head held high,

22:17.244 --> 22:18.218
so that my mother
could become a spy.

22:18.254 --> 22:21.513
Then my mother, well, she...

22:21.549 --> 22:23.799
she kinda dragged me
into this without asking,

22:23.834 --> 22:26.184
but you know what, I digress.

22:26.220 --> 22:28.829
Some people kick down doors,

22:28.864 --> 22:31.106
some people get dragged through
doors against their will.

22:31.141 --> 22:34.743
Anyway...

22:34.778 --> 22:38.647
it is thanks to Cleo that
all young black female spies

22:38.682 --> 22:43.177
can be brave,
know our worth, and fly.

22:43.212 --> 22:44.406
And that is why
we honor her today

22:44.430 --> 22:45.854
with this bust.

22:52.312 --> 22:54.313
Oh, baby, it's okay.
You can let it out.

22:54.348 --> 23:02.348
( Giggling ) She said bust.
