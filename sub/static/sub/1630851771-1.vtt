WEBVTT

00:05.605 --> 00:08.407
St. Kitts is, like,
absolute paradise.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.143
It seems untouched, wild,

00:11.178 --> 00:15.014
exotic, volcanic, explosive.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.448
Ah!

00:16.484 --> 00:17.616
-Rachel?
-Shut the [bleep] up.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.151
-Gah.
-No!

00:19.186 --> 00:23.155
-[bleep] sh--.
-Oh [bleep]!

00:23.190 --> 00:24.390
Being able to see the world,

00:24.425 --> 00:25.924
experiencing different
cultures...

00:25.960 --> 00:27.192
That's ----ing yachting.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.415
Okay.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.101
I can see up your skirt, jake.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.238
Yeah?
You like what you see?

00:39.273 --> 00:40.672
What the [bleep]?

00:40.708 --> 00:41.924
Rawr!

00:41.959 --> 00:43.759
Somebody's been
a bad t. Rex!

00:43.794 --> 00:45.928
Hashtag zero [bleep]s given.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.930
Ah!

00:47.965 --> 00:49.465
Whop!

00:49.517 --> 00:53.185
Now things should go smoothly,
or heads will roll.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.720
I know how to do my job, right?

00:54.755 --> 00:56.088
You don't need to
tell me how to do it.

00:56.107 --> 00:57.689
She's pure misery at the moment.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.358
I don't know what
the [bleep] I'm doing.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.959
I'm gonna rip someone's
----ing head off.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.561
Don't put my ----ing head on
the goddamn chopping block.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.600
Oh!

01:08.636 --> 01:10.836
You either wanna be here,
or there's a ticket home.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.371
I'll fire every single
----ing one of you

01:14.708 --> 01:17.676
[sobbing]

01:17.711 --> 01:20.095
the biggest mistake
I've ever made in my life.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.653
Good old my seanna.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.723
Eddie 3.0 is back.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.392
Okay.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.478
Still outta shape, still short,
but now I'm the first officer...

01:36.514 --> 01:37.679
God help me.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.635
Hello?

01:43.654 --> 01:44.736
Hey!

01:44.772 --> 01:45.988
-Captain sean?
-Yes.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.172
-Eddie lucas.
-It's a pleasure!

01:47.208 --> 01:48.173
Pleasure!

01:48.209 --> 01:49.541
Guess I got you for a few days.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.243
Lee called me in the beginning
of the season

01:51.278 --> 01:52.528
and let me know he's gonna
be a little late.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.196
Yeah, I got a
little medical issue.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.614
Is everything all right?

01:55.649 --> 01:57.616
I'm just waiting for
the doctors to clear me.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.651
In the meantime, captain sean,
the delivery captain,

01:59.670 --> 02:01.920
he'll be down there
to start the charter off.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.755
I swear to god, if he
slipped in the shower again,

02:03.791 --> 02:05.674
I'm gonna... Oh, my god.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.209
Glad you've been on board
the boat before.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.011
It is nice that
I've been on before, yeah.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.679
There are a lot of changes.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.198
I threw some new jet-skis and
a new rescue tender up there.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.333
That's nice.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.567
Those jet-skis are sweet.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.136
-That's true, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.507
I always wanna see what's
around that next corner,

02:21.542 --> 02:23.575
under that rock,
under the ocean.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.693
[shouts]

02:24.728 --> 02:27.396
so, I guess that
makes me an explorer.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.648
I got my first captain's license
when I was 18,

02:29.683 --> 02:32.618
so I've always been in
the role of the captain.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.156
But I've got a lot
of experience doing it.

02:38.709 --> 02:39.958
If you want, we can
take a quick walk

02:39.994 --> 02:41.410
around the boat and just do...

02:41.462 --> 02:42.828
Just, I can point out some
of the stuff that's new.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.062
Yeah.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.581
Here I am, coming in
as a first officer,

02:45.633 --> 02:48.133
not really sure
what that entails.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.052
Makes me a little nervous.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.570
So, this is a little bit messy.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.754
You guys, you've got some
work cut out down here.

02:52.806 --> 02:53.772
Okay.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.340
But I'd like to see this
set up and utilized.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.762
We'll get this worked out.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.598
With a captain
I've never worked for,

03:02.650 --> 03:04.483
and that adds a lot
of anxiety and stress

03:04.518 --> 03:06.985
to an already stressful job.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.220
Yamaha 350s.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.088
Actually, I had two 350s
which I took

03:10.124 --> 03:11.823
through the
northwest passage twice.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.893
Wow, that's a hell of a trip.
That's awesome.

03:18.916 --> 03:21.700
Jake, fraser, heather...

03:23.137 --> 03:24.803
Rachel?

03:24.838 --> 03:26.088
Ugh.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.790
Well, well, well, nice boat.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.461
May as well take my old room.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.680
Are those loofahs? Ah!

03:34.715 --> 03:37.799
V-necks, awesome.
Never wore that.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.085
Hi, how are you?

03:40.104 --> 03:41.637
Heather, pleasure to meet you!

03:41.689 --> 03:43.589
-I'm sean, your captain.
-Hi, sean.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.275
I'm super-stoked to
be here, very excited.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.559
-Wonderful.
-Nice boat!

03:47.594 --> 03:48.994
-Beautiful day.
-Well, thank you.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.797
This wind is insane.
What's the knots at?

03:51.832 --> 03:53.448
You know when you pop
a bottle of champagne,

03:53.484 --> 03:54.816
it's like [pops]

03:54.868 --> 03:56.802
and it gives you those
chills down your spine?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.654
I would say
that's my personality.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.340
As the chief stew,
yes, I'm a beacon of light.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.126
Yet at the same time,
I don't [bleep] around.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.327
Tell me about
yourself real quick.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.412
Been in yachting
for five years now.

04:07.447 --> 04:08.997
-Okay.
-Never looked back.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.550
No job too big or
too small, that's for sure.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.551
Good, I like to hear that.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.387
I'm 25, and to some,

04:15.422 --> 04:17.956
they'd say I've climbed
the success ladder fast.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.809
But I've earned this position
as much as anyone else has.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.345
I mean, I cleaned dildos
for a few months

04:23.397 --> 04:24.763
in Italy once on a yacht.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.683
I did not get here
easily at all.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.151
I was just actually
looking at what

04:29.186 --> 04:31.019
your interior team's
gonna look like.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.355
Here's fraser...
This guy looks interesting.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.995
Okay, fluent in french,
worked in the med...

04:40.030 --> 04:40.996
Oh, that's awesome.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.331
This is jessica albert.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.782
On and off for five years,

04:43.817 --> 04:45.867
only as a solo stew,
though, all right.

04:45.919 --> 04:46.868
She could be good.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.370
Well, cool, can I take
these while I settle in?

04:48.422 --> 04:49.821
-Those are yours, yeah.
-Awesome.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.173
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Pleasure to meet you.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.457
-Very excited.
-Look forward to it.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.011
Oh, this is liquid yacht wear.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.547
Sh--.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.016
Think I forgot to pack t-shirts.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.200
Knock-knock, anyone down here?

05:02.236 --> 05:03.552
-Hi!
-How you doing?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.020
-How's it going?
-Eddie, nice to meet you.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.388
-Heather, pleasure to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.473
-Chief stew? Yes.
-Excellent.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.195
I'm confused... The bags
upstairs say lee,

05:13.230 --> 05:14.563
but that's the captain?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.948
Captain lee got delayed,
so he will be here.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.318
-Okay.
-But it's gonna be however long.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.352
Very cool.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.355
She's interior, for sure.

05:23.374 --> 05:24.456
Oh.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.791
You gonna go penthouse?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.659
I feel like the beds
are bigger up there.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.194
-Hey.
-I'm fraser, nice to meet you.

05:29.213 --> 05:30.362
I'm jessica.

05:34.968 --> 05:35.801
Fishing boats, awesome.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.803
Hm, I think
she's gonna be great.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.039
So, how long were you
doing yachting before?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.007
-Five years.
-Oh, wow, okay.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.677
Just one?

05:48.482 --> 05:51.933
The whole point of yachting is
that it's all about the details.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.604
I have been working yachting
for nearly two years now,

05:55.656 --> 05:58.824
and I genuinely enjoy
making things perfect.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.575
It's a pro and a con, really,

06:00.611 --> 06:02.244
because wherever I go now,
I'm unimpressed.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.597
If I could have anyone serve me,
it would be myself.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.866
Sorry, but not sorry.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.120
Yeah.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.171
How's your deck team looking?

06:13.207 --> 06:15.740
Looking all right.

06:15.759 --> 06:17.542
This guy jake, he's got a lot
of really good experience.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.461
He worked on a 74 and a 78.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.962
Lead on deck, fantastic.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.547
-Heya.
-Oh, my god, how are you?

06:22.582 --> 06:24.282
I'm all right, thanks,
how are you?

06:24.318 --> 06:25.517
I'm well.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.754
-What's your name?
-Rayna.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.272
-I'm jake.
-Are you a deckhand?

06:30.307 --> 06:31.523
I am indeed.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.025
I like what I see, yeah.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.060
-Hello.
-Hi!

06:35.095 --> 06:36.061
-How you doing?
-Mwah.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.279
I love your nose ring, okay?

06:37.314 --> 06:38.980
-Thank you very much.
-I love it.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.615
I love your style, I love your
hair as well, it's beautiful.

06:40.651 --> 06:41.950
And it's on the left side, so...
Thank you!

06:41.985 --> 06:43.151
Have you ever worked
with a male stew before?

06:43.203 --> 06:44.636
No, I have not.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.104
I've been a solo stew
for most of my career.

06:46.123 --> 06:47.105
That's a pretty big deal.

06:47.124 --> 06:48.290
Yeah.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.291
How long have you been
in yachting?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.543
Um... Since September.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.994
So, you're pretty new, then.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.513
-I know, yeah, but...
-You're a greenie.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.747
I used to fish in
alaska as a deckhand.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.132
I was doing fishing charters.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.050
Yeah, what do you think
about the boat so far?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.787
From what I've seen,
it's opulent.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.556
Yeah, we've got
a lot of work to do.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.993
Hi, how's it going?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.494
-I'm fraser, nice to meet you.
-How you doing?

07:09.530 --> 07:10.595
-Heather, pleasure to meet you.
-Jessica.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.331
I'm heather, your chief stew.

07:13.367 --> 07:14.850
[chuckles]

07:16.370 --> 07:17.669
yeah.

07:18.989 --> 07:21.857
Sure is.

07:21.909 --> 07:22.874
Awesome.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.993
-Here we go.
-Knock-knock!

07:25.028 --> 07:27.028
-I'm fraser, nice to meet you.
-Eddie, good to meet you.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.447
Okay, I think I'm gonna
put him in here with...

07:28.482 --> 07:29.448
-That's fine.
-...With you.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.333
Ooh!
So pretty.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.751
I look forward
to living together.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.286
-Yeah, sounds good.
-In a closet!

07:34.321 --> 07:36.121
What's up? I'm jake.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.172
-Jake.
-Rayna.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.173
-Rayna.
-Nice to meet you.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.324
-Wes.
-Wes.

07:39.343 --> 07:41.626
-Yeah.
-Why is this a v-neck?

07:41.661 --> 07:43.495
-Deckhand?
-Deckhand.

07:43.514 --> 07:44.662
Oh, all of us are deckhands.

07:44.681 --> 07:45.881
-Nice.
-Yes!

07:45.933 --> 07:47.098
Go on!

07:50.370 --> 07:51.720
How long have you
been in yachting?

07:51.772 --> 07:55.106
First yacht, so I captain
sailboats in st. Thomas.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.358
You excited to work on a yacht?

07:56.393 --> 07:58.226
I'm stoked.
Like look at this thing.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.544
Look at the shininess!

07:59.580 --> 08:01.246
Look at this, it's so shiny!

08:01.281 --> 08:02.948
On st. Thomas
I'm a sailboat captain.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.534
I love sailing, been in
love with it all my life,

08:05.569 --> 08:08.019
but I need more experience
with chartering.

08:08.038 --> 08:09.738
You know, you don't
wanna be stagnant.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.657
Working on a megayacht,
you just have more options.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.043
You also make money.
There's way more money.

08:15.078 --> 08:18.196
I probably shouldn't say this
out loud, but I love polishing.

08:18.215 --> 08:21.750
-I love polishing, too.
-Yeah, see, there we go!

08:21.802 --> 08:24.085
Let's just turn over the
laundry before our meeting.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.572
The key to our success
lies in this being good

08:27.608 --> 08:28.640
to start off with, right?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.141
-Yeah, agreed.
-Uh-huh.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.343
-What's up, man?
-Hey!

08:31.378 --> 08:32.611
How you all doing? I'm eddie.

08:32.646 --> 08:33.845
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.348
-Rayna.
-Eddie, pleasure to meet you.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.849
Wes, good to meet you guys.
How you all doing?

08:37.885 --> 08:39.084
I'm all right, thanks,
how are you?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.068
Good, good, yeah.

08:40.103 --> 08:41.520
So, we're picking up
a charter tomorrow.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.121
-Yes.
-Yeah.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.322
I'd like to get someone
in the lead deckhand position

08:44.358 --> 08:45.323
as quickly as possible.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.908
-Sounds good.
-Cool.

08:46.944 --> 08:47.909
All right, guys, let's
go show you what's up.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.361
Have you joined the boat single?

08:49.396 --> 08:50.395
I have.

08:50.414 --> 08:51.530
Ooh, yes.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.633
-Hi, I'm jake.
-Heather, pleasure to meet you.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.967
Heather, pleasure
to meet you too.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.252
-Welcome on board.
-Thank you very much.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.670
-Chief stew?
-That I am.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.772
Oh, nice.
I think I'll have you in here...

09:00.807 --> 09:01.673
-Yeah?
-With wes.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.008
Thank you very much.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.276
Bit snug in here.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.645
Yeah, look at this, uh-huh!

09:06.680 --> 09:08.096
I took the bottom because
I get up in the middle

09:08.131 --> 09:09.381
-of the night to pee.
-Girl, you're fine...

09:09.416 --> 09:10.932
You're fine, you're fine.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.884
-I don't wanna wake you up.
-You're okay.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.803
Are you pretty comfortable on
lines and everything like that?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.021
-Yeah.
-Good.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.222
Yeah.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.623
How you feel with line-handling
and everything, you good?

09:18.659 --> 09:19.624
-Oh, yeah.
-Good.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.942
All crew, all, crew,

09:20.978 --> 09:22.811
crew meeting in the
sky lounge, please.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.263
Copy that, on my way up.

09:25.282 --> 09:27.148
Are you just gonna fart
every single step?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.233
Ah!

09:28.268 --> 09:30.452
Let the fun begin.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.604
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm good.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.822
-Good morning, everybody.
-Hello.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.607
-Well, welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

09:35.626 --> 09:37.158
Some of you were expecting
captain lee.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.294
I was also expecting
captain lee.

09:39.329 --> 09:43.331
I was the delivery captain for
the boat, but he's been delayed.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.000
So, I don't know
when he's gonna get here,

09:45.052 --> 09:48.219
but in the meantime
you're stuck with me.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.455
We'll see what happens.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.257
Couple other hands
that we have on board,

09:52.292 --> 09:54.792
our engineers and
one of our mates.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.962
We've got gal, alex, and jon.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.847
Expectations during charters...

09:58.899 --> 10:00.982
I'm not very good
at cracking the whip,

10:01.018 --> 10:03.184
but I am excellent
at swinging an axe.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.856
So, just bear that in mind.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.341
Don't do anything stupid,

10:09.376 --> 10:11.660
because I really don't
care what position

10:11.695 --> 10:13.378
you play on board the boat.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.748
I'm not gonna yell at your
for it, I'm just gonna fire you.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.284
This is not a good sign.
Scary.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.752
Don't piss me off.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.921
And if I have to run
short-handed, I will.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.192
Coming up...

10:27.227 --> 10:28.209
This looks like sh--.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.878
There's just really no
way to make this cozy.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.380
-I know how.
-[bleep]

10:32.432 --> 10:33.798
dude's crazy.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.800
Now it's not
a complete waste of space.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.556
Don't do anything stupid,
because I'm just gonna fire you.

10:41.591 --> 10:43.541
Don't put me in a position
where I'm gonna have to

10:43.560 --> 10:45.777
do something that you'll regret.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.681
Oh, god.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.433
I'm not a sit-around
type of guy.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.785
I've done all the jobs
on board this boat.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.220
I'm looking for how can we
make things more efficient.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.238
Sounds good to me.

10:57.274 --> 10:58.890
So, practical matters...

10:58.909 --> 11:02.077
Our chef is arriving
sometime today.

11:02.112 --> 11:04.579
Charter guests will be
arriving around 3:00 p.M.

11:04.614 --> 11:06.698
Tomorrow, and provisions
should be here any minute now.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.083
Let's all get to work.

11:08.118 --> 11:10.268
We'll go have our
quick little meeting.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.736
Guys, you see how
good the decks look?

11:11.755 --> 11:12.637
Yes.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.639
I'd like to try
to keep them like that.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.908
So, now that the fun's begun,
now the real work begins.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.543
So, this is bosun's locker
number one.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.761
There's also another one
up forward here,

11:19.796 --> 11:20.962
anything you could
possibly need.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.614
Love the experience
you guys have.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.100
Fraser, you've worked
some seasons in the med.

11:25.135 --> 11:28.219
Jess, you've been a solo
stew before, that's great.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.106
Is there anything you love
doing more than the other?

11:31.141 --> 11:32.440
I love doing laundry.

11:32.476 --> 11:33.775
I really do.

11:33.810 --> 11:35.827
I haven't heard someone
say that in years.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.762
I have been in yachting,
give or take, five years.

11:37.781 --> 11:40.432
But for the last year
I've been in southwest florida

11:40.467 --> 11:42.650
helping care for
my elderly grandparents.

11:42.703 --> 11:46.104
While I've been there,
I have taken it upon myself

11:46.123 --> 11:47.872
to get my cosmetology license.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.824
But you know,
yachting is something

11:49.876 --> 11:52.477
I come back to because it's an
easy way to make money.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.295
And after putting myself
through school again,

11:54.331 --> 11:56.664
I could definitely
use some money.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.133
I agree with you,
I think it's very fun.

11:58.168 --> 11:59.250
I will be the lady
of the laundry.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.119
It is a great spot.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.505
I think it's if you don't like
laundry, there's a problem.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.757
I have been head
of housekeeping,

12:05.792 --> 12:07.308
so I do love everything
that comes down here.

12:07.344 --> 12:08.660
Lovely.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.146
So, for the start of the season
and hopefully the whole season,

12:11.181 --> 12:12.313
we're gonna have you
as our second stew.

12:12.349 --> 12:13.765
Okay.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.833
And we'll have you as
the third for now.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.300
So, I'll have you on mornings

12:16.319 --> 12:18.486
and you on lates
for the first trip.

12:18.522 --> 12:21.356
I'm putting fraser as second
stew because his experience

12:21.408 --> 12:23.541
on bigger yachts is
a lot more valuable

12:23.577 --> 12:25.110
than someone as a sole stew.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.029
But also, jessica is just
dying to be in the laundry room,

12:28.081 --> 12:31.833
so I feel like
the stars have aligned.

12:31.868 --> 12:33.818
So, we'll just go check out
the guest rooms together,

12:33.837 --> 12:35.453
so we can kinda see
what we're working with.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.155
-Yeah.
-You guys wanna clean the yacht?

12:37.174 --> 12:38.173
Sick!

12:38.208 --> 12:39.758
So, this is the beach club.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.325
We're gonna really try
to utilize this space,

12:41.344 --> 12:43.178
so we're gonna be organizing
this, get it cleaned up.

12:43.213 --> 12:44.662
Someone do the beds,

12:44.681 --> 12:46.047
someone wipe down all
the little surfaces.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.999
-Sure.
-Make sure it's all good.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.684
Could you feed me some
hose round, please?

12:49.719 --> 12:51.352
-You need some more?
-Some more hose, please.

12:51.388 --> 12:52.554
You're so needy!

12:52.606 --> 12:56.941
♪ I've got hose, I got hose ♪

12:56.977 --> 12:57.892
you're an idiot.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.694
Just wanna make sure
that all beds are done.

12:59.729 --> 13:01.446
It keeps the ocd in check.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.149
Attention all crew, attention
all crew, provisions are here.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.984
Provisions time, woo!

13:06.019 --> 13:07.085
Copy, on our way up.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.453
Some of this needs to be frozen.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.854
Make sure it goes,
like, kinda together,

13:09.890 --> 13:11.055
so we can get that into
the icebox right away.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.056
Yep.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.025
-Jesus!
-Thank you.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.493
Heather, where we
sticking all the booze?

13:15.529 --> 13:17.028
Bridge deck aft for right now.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.229
Sweet.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.414
Teamwork makes the dream work.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.366
All right.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.366
-Jesus!
-Amen.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.219
This is a sh-- show.

13:24.254 --> 13:25.737
Where is the chef, do you know?

13:25.772 --> 13:28.089
-Going up.
-This must be our chef.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.224
That's her, all right...

13:29.259 --> 13:31.976
Chef rachel.
Damn talented.

13:32.012 --> 13:32.944
Bat sh-- crazy.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.679
You know, rachel and I,
we left last season

13:34.714 --> 13:36.231
on a, like, really bad note.

13:36.266 --> 13:37.432
Go [bleep] yourself.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.884
Eat my cooter.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.452
Working with rachel
again this season,

13:41.488 --> 13:43.188
it makes me nervous.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.589
Howdy.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.590
I like the hair,
I like the color.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.258
Thanks, eddie.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.077
Are you a primary, or are you
the chef, what's going on here?

13:49.112 --> 13:51.696
Once again, here I am, late, and
everybody else is on the boat.

13:51.731 --> 13:52.897
-Captain sean.
-This is chef rachel.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.699
-Hi.
-It's nice to meet you.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.951
You look much too glamorous
to be a chef on board here.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.572
There ya go.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.273
But now this time we have
the new captain,

14:02.309 --> 14:03.842
which has totally blown my mind.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.878
But at the same time,
I like short men.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.597
I like to play a game, like,
where's your penis, honey?

14:09.633 --> 14:11.599
Oh, hi, heather.

14:11.635 --> 14:13.251
-Nice to meet you, rachel.
-Pleasure to meet you.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.919
Is she the...
Is she in the penthouse?

14:14.938 --> 14:16.254
If that's all right with you.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.189
-That's fine by me.
-Okay.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.641
Beautiful.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.061
Oh [bleep] me.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.637
Here you go.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.539
Awesome. You're a lifesaver.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.291
How you feeling?

14:36.326 --> 14:37.659
Good.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.295
Last year, nightmare.
Stew pantry issue.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.547
-Yeah.
-Okay, cool.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.915
It was a nightmare.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.800
With heather being
the new chief on board,

14:45.835 --> 14:50.454
I need to execute up front
communication immediately.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.590
It would be epic if you guys
spent more time in setup...

14:52.625 --> 14:53.975
Yeah.

14:54.010 --> 14:55.293
Down here, because
I don't use that area.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.678
Yeah.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.646
I can't have her keep me
separated from getting

14:58.682 --> 15:00.932
one step closer
to world domination,

15:00.967 --> 15:02.684
because that's ----ed.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.153
Plus, it gives a good
communication between you and I.

15:05.188 --> 15:07.238
Of course, I definitely
wanna set that up.

15:09.693 --> 15:10.775
The scuppies are done.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.780
You guys haven't wiped down
or anything yet, right?

15:15.815 --> 15:17.498
Yeah, they need to be polished.

15:17.534 --> 15:19.117
It's a lot of progress.

15:22.172 --> 15:25.490
Eddie, eddie, heather,
heather, and rachel, rachel.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.624
Preference sheet meeting,
probably.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.959
Oh.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.994
I have the preference sheets
in my hand.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.630
I'll meet you down in
the crew mess right now.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.265
<i> -Copy that.</i>
-God, I'm good.

15:36.052 --> 15:37.518
All right, you guys
ready for this?

15:37.554 --> 15:39.003
-Let's do it.
-Ooh!

15:39.022 --> 15:42.273
All right, so this is our
primary, nikki foster.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.026
Nikki is a senior broadcasting
content producer.

15:45.061 --> 15:46.894
And then joining nikki
is her crew

15:46.947 --> 15:48.479
of girlfriends from college.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.316
-Bring it, nikki!
-Bring it!

15:51.351 --> 15:53.684
The guests are gonna be here
at 3:00, so no need for lunch,

15:53.703 --> 15:55.353
just some snacks should be fine.

15:55.372 --> 15:59.657
Day one, they want
high-end caribelle batik outfits

15:59.692 --> 16:01.042
and local delicacies.

16:01.077 --> 16:04.045
And then late-night,
a high-end pajama party.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.247
And they would also like
to play a jenga-style game

16:06.299 --> 16:09.334
but with questions and dares
written on each block.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.385
All right, day two...

16:10.420 --> 16:12.303
Private beach day.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.888
Request captain to join dinner.

16:13.923 --> 16:16.224
Fancy as ----ing rich bitch
sh-- only.

16:16.259 --> 16:19.310
I'm a little nervous, because
when you get a group of girls

16:19.346 --> 16:22.063
like this all together,
it's gonna get a little crazy.

16:22.098 --> 16:24.682
Me and my girlfriends
used to get insane.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.101
I remember frantically
looking for my dignity

16:27.153 --> 16:29.687
after one night
in san francisco.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.272
We won't go there.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.025
All right, everybody
feel good, excited?

16:34.060 --> 16:34.926
Yeah.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.227
It is hot in here.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.195
No fingerprints.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.589
I'm really gonna be looking
to you to handle housekeeping.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.274
Great.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.443
And I'm really gonna be looking
to you to handle laundry.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.263
-K2r, stain and [bleep].
-Yes!

16:55.298 --> 16:57.632
This sh-- is so good.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.355
-Thanks for a great first day.
-Good night.

17:06.976 --> 17:08.276
Are we gonna be on deck
at 7:30, or...

17:08.311 --> 17:09.394
-On deck, 7:30.
-Okay.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.395
Good night, good night.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.366
Oh!

17:20.173 --> 17:21.506
[beeping]

17:25.495 --> 17:26.994
[bleep] me.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.249
[beeps]

17:31.284 --> 17:32.483
blah!

17:32.519 --> 17:35.336
-[beeps]
-yeah [bleep] you.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.122
I'm gonna have you on ironing
the shirts really quick.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.091
We just wanna make sure
there's no watermarks

17:40.126 --> 17:42.827
on the teak, because it looks
so nice at the moment, so.

17:42.862 --> 17:47.031
The welcome towels, roll up as
many as you can, at least 16.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.632
How we doing in the exterior?

17:48.651 --> 17:49.650
Exterior, we're looking
pretty good.

17:49.686 --> 17:51.135
All right, let's get this done.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.154
I gotta make sure that
the big boat starts, so.

17:53.189 --> 17:55.639
-That's probably be important.
-Yeah.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.158
No watermarks, no watermarks.

17:57.193 --> 18:00.411
All crew, all crew,
one hour till guest arrival.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.331
Wow, time to un-[bleep] the laz.

18:03.366 --> 18:04.415
[grunts]

18:05.535 --> 18:06.784
my ----ing back!

18:08.755 --> 18:12.123
Oop sh--.

18:12.158 --> 18:12.790
[bleep] off.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.659
Just show you what I expect,

18:14.694 --> 18:16.794
I'm a big stickler on making
sure the middles all have,

18:16.830 --> 18:20.664
like, a because line, so that
they all look perfect in unison.

18:20.683 --> 18:21.849
This looks good, right?

18:24.104 --> 18:25.520
Yeah, it still needs some work.

18:25.555 --> 18:26.854
This looks like sh--.

18:26.890 --> 18:28.506
Just make it look a
little friendlier.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.358
There's just really no way
to make this cozy.

18:30.393 --> 18:31.359
I know how.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.562
[bleep]

18:34.614 --> 18:36.864
captain sean has got really good
intentions, and I respect that.

18:36.900 --> 18:40.184
Angle it, so when that door is
open they're looking at that.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.954
But at the same time,
it's like, dude's crazy.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.022
Now it's not
a complete waste of space.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.357
Alarms are ringing.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.042
I'm very excited
for this first charter.

18:48.077 --> 18:49.744
-You are?
-Yeah, I am.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.295
Good, that makes one of us.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.132
Coming up...

18:54.167 --> 18:55.733
I feel behind downstairs,
by the way.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.385
Yeah, we really are.

18:57.420 --> 18:58.886
There needs to be a plan, and
there's no plan right now.

18:58.922 --> 19:01.272
Fraser, can I get
some backup on service?

19:04.409 --> 19:06.744
I'd rather uncover right now
in our blues.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.147
No time to be too cute,
let's go.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.648
Hm.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.300
Eddie, there's no clips
on these.

19:12.335 --> 19:14.118
Of course there's not.

19:14.137 --> 19:15.619
God is good!

19:15.638 --> 19:18.589
What am I looking for?
I don't ----ing know.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.159
Okay. Okay.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.127
Chef coat, ready to go.

19:23.146 --> 19:24.529
Oh, yeah, just killing it.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.863
Okay.

19:25.899 --> 19:26.964
Gorgeous.

19:26.983 --> 19:30.134
All crew, all crew, 30 minutes
till guest arrival.

19:30.153 --> 19:31.802
I am excited.

19:31.821 --> 19:35.489
Let's get this show on
the mother-----ing road.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.528
I know!

19:40.580 --> 19:42.280
I feel like a stuffed sausage.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.614
You look amazing.

19:45.484 --> 19:46.951
Yes.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.288
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.924
Trying to arrange these pillows
so they down blow away.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.343
It's so humid my hair
can't stay up like this.

19:55.378 --> 19:58.162
It's so annoying.

19:58.181 --> 19:59.330
All right.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.631
Everybody feeling good?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.500
Yeah. Yeah.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.502
-So windy today.
-I know.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.003
I cannot wait.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.172
Tighten it up, guys, a bit.
Tighten it up.

20:08.191 --> 20:10.024
-Is that a black man?
-It's a black girl.

20:10.059 --> 20:11.809
-Okay!
-Okay, black crew!

20:11.844 --> 20:13.611
Curl up that moustache
real quick.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.695
Don't trip.

20:14.731 --> 20:16.113
I know, don't trip, guys.

20:16.149 --> 20:18.316
I'm obsessed, I can't deal.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.884
Good afternoon, how are you?

20:19.919 --> 20:21.452
-Good, how are you?
-Welcome aboard.

20:21.487 --> 20:22.486
Thank you.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.854
-Hi, heather.
-Hi.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.190
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Hi, how are you?

20:26.226 --> 20:27.358
-Oh!
-Ooh!

20:27.393 --> 20:28.859
My hat!

20:28.878 --> 20:29.860
That's okay, you're fabulous,
thank you.

20:29.879 --> 20:30.861
Thank you, sweets.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.029
-Hi!
-Hi, welcome!

20:32.048 --> 20:34.098
-Thank you.
-Hey, how you doing?

20:38.554 --> 20:40.805
Good afternoon, everybody,
and welcome aboard my seanna.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.207
We're here to serve you, and if

20:43.226 --> 20:45.476
there's anything that
you need, let her know.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.011
Anyway, no, let me know,

20:47.046 --> 20:48.813
and we'll do our best
to take care of it.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.231
All right, are you guys
ready to have some fun?

20:50.266 --> 20:51.983
-Yes, cheers!
-Cheers!

20:52.018 --> 20:55.886
If you wanna follow me, I'll
give you a tour of the interior.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.488
This is our bridge deck aft.

20:57.523 --> 21:00.024
You've got a bunch of different
lovely lounging areas.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.492
Beautiful.

21:01.527 --> 21:02.927
Ah!

21:04.897 --> 21:06.197
She doesn't wanna hang
with this wind.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.415
-Yeah.
-Look at this bad boy.

21:07.450 --> 21:09.066
Oh... Oh, god!

21:09.085 --> 21:10.101
Sick!

21:10.136 --> 21:11.402
Oh, guys.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.571
This is our sun deck.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.239
Submersive hot tub.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.757
I'm getting in this.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.594
We've got the master suite.

21:20.630 --> 21:25.182
Ha ha ha!
Party, party!

21:25.218 --> 21:27.218
-Thank you.
-All right, right behind you.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.552
All righty.

21:28.587 --> 21:30.921
So, is it okay if I set up some
hors d'oeuvres n the sky lounge?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.440
You know what I would love?

21:32.475 --> 21:33.858
A chocolate martini.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.643
Yeah, well, you can
have whatever you want,

21:35.695 --> 21:37.295
you let me know,
I'm here for you.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.132
Rayna, I want you to
go help jake up forward

21:41.167 --> 21:42.566
-with those lines, okay?
-Yes, sir.

21:42.601 --> 21:43.818
-You're on the stern?
-Yes.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.603
Do me a favor...
How far away is that dock?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.289
Hundred feet.

21:48.324 --> 21:50.308
Closer to 150,
but that's all right.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.043
Come back to me, captain lee!

21:52.078 --> 21:53.995
Come back to me, my boat daddy!

21:54.047 --> 21:56.247
One-fifty, huh?
I don't see it.

21:58.334 --> 22:00.251
Yes!

22:00.286 --> 22:02.586
Let's take that spring off,
please... Yep.

22:02.621 --> 22:05.122
<i> Okay, guys back aft, you can</i>
<i> start dropping lines, please.</i>

22:05.141 --> 22:06.924
Pull, pull, pull!

22:08.361 --> 22:10.627
The marina in st. Kitts is
unforgiving because

22:10.646 --> 22:14.965
on either side of the channel
coming in are volcanic rocks.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.469
It's shallow, the wind whips
through at 25 knots.

22:18.488 --> 22:19.937
Go, go, go.

22:21.157 --> 22:22.639
But I feel pretty confident
about taking

22:22.658 --> 22:24.075
the boat off the dock today.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.610
I've done this before,
and I know I can do it.

22:26.645 --> 22:27.912
Bada-bing, bada-boom.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.613
Jesus, that was a good gust.

22:29.648 --> 22:31.449
Oh, my, guys, we're moving.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.651
Oh, this is amazing!

22:35.188 --> 22:37.254
Plenty of room on your swing
on your starboard side.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.092
Yeah.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.361
-The fenders can come up.
-All right.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.996
This is so pretty, oh, my gosh.

22:46.015 --> 22:48.666
I need someone to turn
the stabilizers on, please.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.201
Copy that, on my way.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.237
Okay, welp, I'm gonna go
put on my swimsuit.

22:53.272 --> 22:54.772
-Nice job on deck.
-Yeah, they...

22:54.807 --> 22:56.006
They've all got their limbs,
right?

22:56.025 --> 22:57.191
They all still
have their limbs, yeah.

22:57.226 --> 22:58.242
Okay, good.

22:58.277 --> 23:00.061
Where on earth to begin?

23:00.113 --> 23:03.381
The drink that I've only
heard of in my nightmares.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.866
Is there any way I could steal
you to juice lemons right now?

23:05.902 --> 23:07.151
Yeah, absolutely.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.953
There's a first time
for everything.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.288
I say yes to all my guests,

23:11.324 --> 23:13.874
but I have no idea what
a chocolate martini is.

23:13.910 --> 23:17.395
On my previous boat,
I was head of housekeeping,

23:17.430 --> 23:19.914
and that doesn't include
me making cocktails.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.265
This is gonna be stunning,

23:21.300 --> 23:23.700
he says, before the poor
guest vomits.

23:23.719 --> 23:26.537
Back to juicin'!

23:26.556 --> 23:28.722
What on earth is all of this?

23:31.594 --> 23:33.427
Try it, because I know
how good it is.

23:35.381 --> 23:36.063
I know, right?

23:36.099 --> 23:38.182
-You are my guy.
-This is great.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.718
<i> Fraser, fraser, heather.</i>

23:41.737 --> 23:43.854
Could you please come up
and tidy the bar for me?

23:43.889 --> 23:45.189
<i> Of course.</i>

23:45.224 --> 23:46.390
Just start prepping
the anchor, please.

23:46.409 --> 23:47.741
Meat and cheese
is ready to roll.

23:47.777 --> 23:49.059
Okay.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.895
Oh, okay, no, this
is a lot of wind.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.364
I'm crawling.
I'm crawling.

23:53.399 --> 23:57.067
So, we take the pitch brake off,
we'll open this all the way up.

23:57.086 --> 23:59.736
Do I go above and
beyond and offer to unpack,

23:59.755 --> 24:01.906
or do I save myself...

24:01.941 --> 24:04.942
...And then we'll
probably offer to unpack.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.427
Colossal waste of time.

24:06.462 --> 24:09.797
-Where are the appetizers?
-I know, I gotta have food.

24:09.849 --> 24:13.217
[gasps] [bleep] my life!
[bleep] my life!

24:13.252 --> 24:14.751
Okay, guys, are
we good up there?

24:14.770 --> 24:16.137
Yeah, I'm ready.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.388
Gimme two shots,
let's see how that looks.

24:17.423 --> 24:18.389
Two shots.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.960
<i> Let's see if she's biting.</i>
<i> I think she just grabbed.</i>

24:22.995 --> 24:24.928
Is there dairy-free
cheese over there?

24:24.947 --> 24:26.297
I don't believe so,

24:26.332 --> 24:27.448
but I'll definitely get
some going for you.

24:27.483 --> 24:29.783
-No worries.
-Ugh!

24:29.819 --> 24:31.168
[bleep] me.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.786
Get the fenders ready
for the tender back aft.

24:32.822 --> 24:33.988
-Yep.
-Heather?

24:34.040 --> 24:35.823
-Yes?
-How can I help you?

24:35.875 --> 24:37.441
Just clean up this bar
ever so quickly.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.176
I was about...
Yeah, absolutely. Of course.

24:39.212 --> 24:40.478
Have we got any
dairy-free cheese?

24:40.513 --> 24:41.879
-It's right here.
-Stunning, can I...

24:41.914 --> 24:43.414
Should I take that up?

24:43.449 --> 24:44.582
No, I'm gonna take it up
with these drinks right now.

24:44.617 --> 24:45.749
Okay.

24:47.470 --> 24:50.020
I'm not a fan of having
to tell people

24:50.056 --> 24:51.589
to do something more than once.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.792
You have to be willing to do
whatever is asked of you.

24:54.827 --> 24:58.312
That is how you climb
the ladder as fast as I did.

25:01.534 --> 25:04.702
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

25:04.737 --> 25:05.903
Coming up...

25:05.938 --> 25:07.638
Where is the fun?

25:07.657 --> 25:09.073
I wanna shoot some people.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.975
Okay, great.
I hope I'm not one of those.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.776
Well, not like that,
that's so horrible.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.952
I've got some cashew
nut cheese here...

25:21.988 --> 25:23.988
That's for me!

25:24.023 --> 25:25.656
This is what I do, baby.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.124
Ah!

25:27.159 --> 25:29.026
[laughing]

25:29.045 --> 25:30.711
what's happening, chef?

25:30.746 --> 25:31.562
What's up?

25:31.597 --> 25:33.364
Not much,
how's everything going?

25:33.399 --> 25:35.216
You know how it is.

25:36.752 --> 25:37.835
That's good.

25:39.222 --> 25:40.804
-Cool.
-Yeah.

25:42.975 --> 25:47.228
I never knew how eddie
actually felt last season

25:47.263 --> 25:49.146
about everything that
had transpired.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.515
I want some ----ing
dirty-ass sh--.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.284
Walking away from this
situation.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.436
Someone's gotta have a talk with
her when she's sober again.

25:55.488 --> 25:57.488
Be like, you're a ----ing
monster when you drink.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.356
Had to get told about it
after the season.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.109
So, it's like do I trust you
that you're gonna turn

26:02.161 --> 26:03.727
around behind
my back again and do it?

26:03.746 --> 26:05.395
No, I don't.

26:05.414 --> 26:06.563
I'm gonna get outta your way.

26:06.582 --> 26:07.915
-Cool, thank you.
-Thank you.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.671
-Ready?
-Yeah.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.506
Woo!

26:15.541 --> 26:17.074
Nice, ladies,
before it gets on you.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.009
Here we are.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.178
Fraser, you are amazing.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.346
Mm, mm, mm!

26:22.381 --> 26:24.682
Can we talk extravaganza?

26:24.717 --> 26:27.017
Stone crab, shrimp,
salt fish, fritters.

26:27.053 --> 26:29.353
Mm-hmm, we're gonna do
this family-style?

26:29.388 --> 26:32.356
What if we did, like,
an extravaganza on the side,

26:32.391 --> 26:33.724
like the bar, for canapés,

26:33.759 --> 26:35.759
and then walk up with an
extravaganza sit-down?

26:35.795 --> 26:37.494
They're gonna wanna be served,

26:37.530 --> 26:39.113
that's kinda the vibe
I'm getting from them.

26:39.148 --> 26:41.565
It's can you carry my
drink up for me one level,

26:41.600 --> 26:43.701
-I need my hands...
-Oh, okay.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.402
-It sounds like.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.342
Rayna!
Me and you, girl.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.993
I need to see more of you.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.311
I know you're doing
lots of things

26:54.347 --> 26:55.996
I got you.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.631
We'll platter it, and we'll
set them out on the table.

26:57.667 --> 26:58.966
Yeah.

26:59.001 --> 27:02.052
Low laying, so it doesn't get
in the way of anyone's faces.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.554
Okay, that's awesome.

27:03.589 --> 27:05.222
-Deck team!
-Yes!

27:05.257 --> 27:06.824
-Deck team!
-Assemble!

27:06.859 --> 27:09.426
Guys, let's go help heather
out in the main salon.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.428
Everybody's talking
about a nap right now.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.100
All right, what do
you need us to do?

27:16.135 --> 27:18.135
Fan these things out,
peel those two things

27:18.170 --> 27:19.803
-so that it sticks together.
-And let them stick together?

27:19.839 --> 27:21.705
And then I can place
them on the ceiling.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.824
There is so much
going on tonight

27:23.859 --> 27:26.443
that I don't feel fully
prepared at all.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.846
I have to expedite this
caribbean-themed dinner,

27:28.881 --> 27:32.416
but also set up for a pajama
party while learning a new crew.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.651
I'm just waiting
for the nail to drop.

27:34.670 --> 27:36.453
We've got, like,
20 minutes till dinner.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.657
Look at the brows.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.425
I'm gonna get my champagne.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.626
We are cute!

27:42.661 --> 27:44.511
I just have to
go pee really bad,

27:44.547 --> 27:47.297
I didn't realize it
till I stood up.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.338
What do you reckon, captain?

27:55.358 --> 27:58.008
-Oh, no!
-It's a good look?

27:58.044 --> 27:59.476
What did I do with it?

27:59.511 --> 28:00.861
Shoved it up my ass,
more than likely.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.863
Quickly finish steaming
those pajamas,

28:02.898 --> 28:05.816
and then we'll get to decorating
for the pajama party.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.518
For the pajama party,
thank you so much.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.620
I'm gonna keep you
on service with me.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.989
Somehow gotta manage all
the turndowns as well.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.291
[gagging]

28:14.326 --> 28:16.694
you okay, what is
wrong with you?

28:16.729 --> 28:18.829
Bro, I almost swallowed my gum.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.165
What do you think, cap?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.332
Not bad.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.500
[bleep]

28:26.338 --> 28:27.888
-are you guys ready to sit?
-Yes.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.506
Beautiful.

28:30.910 --> 28:31.809
You like my shirt?

28:31.844 --> 28:33.610
-Yes!
-We do! I do like it!

28:33.646 --> 28:34.812
So, I'm gonna go water and wine.

28:34.847 --> 28:35.979
Okay.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.449
Why is there no normal milk,
just ----ing almond sh--?

28:38.484 --> 28:39.850
-I like it.
-Almond milk is way better.

28:39.885 --> 28:40.884
Ugh!

28:40.920 --> 28:42.319
You wanna drink cow's
titty milk?

28:42.354 --> 28:43.821
-Yeah.
-That's disgusting.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.222
-Yeah. It's delicious.
-Cow's titty milk.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.690
Can I get you some
red or white?

28:46.726 --> 28:48.025
Yeah.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.913
Fraser, can I get you to the
galley for service, please?

28:52.948 --> 28:54.064
I'll be right up.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.065
Ugh.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.401
Hm, I hate this fabric.

28:58.421 --> 28:59.753
All right, truth or
dare questions...

28:59.789 --> 29:01.405
What's the most disgusting thing

29:01.440 --> 29:03.090
you've done with
a piece of food?

29:03.125 --> 29:04.374
Hm.

29:05.461 --> 29:07.344
Starving.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.179
Conch fritters.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.148
-[bleep]?
-Conch.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.683
-Conch fritters.
-Conch fritters.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.151
-K-o-n-k?
-Conch.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.137
I've not...
I've not had a conch, no.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.822
I've had a bonk,
but that's about it.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.858
May I go with the crustaceans?

29:20.893 --> 29:22.326
-Perfect, thank you.
-Marvelous.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.427
Can I please serve you
a conch fritter?

29:23.462 --> 29:24.762
Absolutely.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.898
We've got the seafood
extravaganza.

29:27.933 --> 29:28.899
Ah!

29:28.934 --> 29:31.785
Yes, I'll have all
of the above, thank you.

29:31.821 --> 29:33.487
-Yes, please.
-I like the sauce.

29:33.539 --> 29:34.705
-Good food.
-Mm-mm.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.040
-It is delicious.
-So yummy.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.379
They love the food.
They're thrilled.

29:42.414 --> 29:43.580
Oh, sweet.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.132
I could do with help
at some point.

29:45.167 --> 29:46.133
-Yeah.
-Of course, yes.

29:46.168 --> 29:47.084
Thank you.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.955
I feel like I'm ironing the same
----ing thing over and over.

29:51.974 --> 29:54.224
Do you mind just throwing
me a black jacket?

29:54.260 --> 29:55.976
-Oh ----ing
-[bleep].

29:56.011 --> 29:57.327
Sorry.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.831
Ugh, I'm running on nothing.

30:00.866 --> 30:03.200
<i> Fraser, can I get</i>
<i> some backup on service?</i>

30:04.770 --> 30:06.870
One of the first rules
in yachting I was told

30:06.906 --> 30:07.988
is that there needs
to be a plan,

30:08.023 --> 30:09.523
and there's
no plan right now.

30:09.575 --> 30:10.974
Is it done,
just be done with it.

30:10.993 --> 30:12.409
Can I take this wonderful
salt fish from you?

30:12.444 --> 30:13.660
Absolutely.

30:13.696 --> 30:16.613
We just look like
headless chickens.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.416
I fell behind downstairs,
by the way.

30:19.451 --> 30:20.984
Yeah, we really are.

30:21.003 --> 30:24.221
Heather needs to place some
order into this chaotic mess.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.590
Where's fraser?
You know what I want.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.008
She wants a chocolate martini.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.377
Ugh, did not need that.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.179
This is just going
to end in tears.

30:32.214 --> 30:33.514
Take a deep breath.

30:33.549 --> 30:34.664
I'm gonna move her
down into cabins.

30:34.683 --> 30:36.016
That would be so good.

30:36.051 --> 30:37.768
I don't want someone to get
tired and think,

30:37.803 --> 30:39.036
oh, I want to go to bed,
and their cabin's not done.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.571
Of course.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.475
Coming up...

30:45.511 --> 30:48.195
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

30:48.230 --> 30:50.447
This is such a rookie mistake.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.482
Completely unacceptable.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.852
She's really not stoked
on everything

30:54.887 --> 30:56.820
in the master at the moment.

31:02.760 --> 31:03.810
Would you like seconds?

31:03.846 --> 31:04.978
I'm okay.

31:05.014 --> 31:06.847
And it's so good, too,
it's hard to stop eating.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.900
-Thank you.
-Deck, deck, rachel.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.688
-Yeah, copy that.
-Is this sll day one?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.823
No... Yes, it is, isn't it?

31:19.645 --> 31:21.411
Jess, if you wanna pop
up and help

31:21.447 --> 31:23.030
knock out those dishes
ever so quickly?

31:23.082 --> 31:24.164
Copy.

31:24.199 --> 31:25.849
See you all in a little bit.

31:25.885 --> 31:26.850
Okay.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.488
If you topple the tower, you
gotta drink everyone's drink.

31:31.507 --> 31:33.090
Yeah.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.374
Let's roll.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.726
-You're all good?
-I'm golden.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.044
Yeah, you're killing it.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.045
Am I?

31:38.097 --> 31:39.546
Where are we going now?

31:39.598 --> 31:41.498
Up to the sky lounge!

31:41.517 --> 31:43.734
-Ah! I see streamers!
-Me, too.

31:43.769 --> 31:46.436
Oh, this is so cute!

31:47.473 --> 31:49.873
All right, back
to business, boys.

Truth or dare!
Who's pulling first?

31:52.278 --> 31:54.528
I'm not going there.
Those things are crazy.

31:54.563 --> 31:56.647
Wash those dishes,
clean that table.

32:00.519 --> 32:01.785
That's it, nothing else?

32:01.820 --> 32:03.153
-Lies!
-Boom, boom.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.242
So, anyone you're attracted
to on the boat?

Well, I fancy you.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.199
I need to let her know
she needs to go down.

What's the worst intimate
experience you've ever had?

32:18.921 --> 32:20.387
-Oh, this is good.
-Yikes.

-And then we'll go from there.
-Awesome.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.234
Oof.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.240
Wow.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.877
All right, so
here's the plan.

34:06.912 --> 34:08.862
-We're going to...
-We're going to, um...

34:08.914 --> 34:12.015
[mumbles]
I'm listening.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.917
Today we're doing the snacks
and beach thing.

34:13.952 --> 34:15.385
That's around the corner.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.953
It's windy; we're gonna
do the best we can.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.588
I'll just stress on, like,
beach setup,

34:18.624 --> 34:20.424
kinda give them
that beach vibe.

34:20.459 --> 34:21.658
-Oh, yeah.
-Gorgeous.

34:21.677 --> 34:24.895
-Let's do that.
-Get in my belly.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.847
Let's get it done.

34:26.882 --> 34:29.549
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.034
So, our specialty this morning,

34:31.070 --> 34:33.887
we're gonna have
the option of crab benedict

34:33.939 --> 34:36.206
or a regular ham benedict.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.909
Could I have just the crab
benedict, no eggs?

34:38.944 --> 34:40.043
-So no real benedict...
-Sure.

34:40.079 --> 34:43.029
Just the crab.
Thank you.

34:43.065 --> 34:44.948
Let's pop this in the
water while we're here.

34:44.983 --> 34:46.416
<i> All right, deck crew,</i>
<i> come to the bow,</i>

34:46.452 --> 34:47.651
<i> we're gonna drop</i>
<i> the rescue tender.</i>

34:47.686 --> 34:49.252
<i> Copy.</i>

34:49.288 --> 34:51.755
Hi, we have four full orders of
benedict and then side eggs.

34:51.790 --> 34:52.956
French toast is ready to roll.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.324
-All right, we good to go?
-Yeah.

34:54.359 --> 34:55.859
All right, let's roll.

34:57.362 --> 34:58.829
Ah!

34:58.864 --> 35:00.297
Eddie, if it's calmer,
we can drop that side.

35:01.967 --> 35:02.933
Okay.

35:04.803 --> 35:05.752
Oh, my gosh.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.254
I'm eating my hair, ugh.

35:10.425 --> 35:11.341
Finishing up.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.561
Ooh, thank you.

35:14.596 --> 35:16.279
-This is medium.
-Lovely.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.448
-How's everything tasting?
-So good.

35:18.484 --> 35:19.483
Feeling good in the body?

35:19.518 --> 35:20.484
Yes!

35:20.519 --> 35:21.818
Full, delicious?

35:21.854 --> 35:23.053
How we doing with beach
stuff put together?

35:23.088 --> 35:24.554
Got everything set up
in the laz,

35:24.573 --> 35:26.022
so we just need to
chuck it in the tender.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.324
Okay, thank you.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.692
Oh, this is divine.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.293
I want a shower.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.078
This is so stressful.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.866
Where would you like her
to meet you?

35:35.901 --> 35:37.617
Okay.
Yeah, no worries.

35:37.669 --> 35:38.952
<i> Heather, heather, rachel.</i>

35:39.004 --> 35:41.004
Yes, the primary
would like for you to meet her

35:41.039 --> 35:42.839
in her master cabin, please.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.457
<i> Copy that.</i>

35:44.510 --> 35:45.759
Hi, how's it going?

35:45.794 --> 35:47.177
So... Well, not so well

35:54.419 --> 35:55.418
oh, my gosh.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.419
So yeah, I just wanted to...

35:56.455 --> 35:57.854
I'm so sorry.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.024
All right, back to business.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.826
This is not up
to standard at all.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.495
This is such a rookie mistake.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.430
Completely unacceptable.

36:07.449 --> 36:08.965
I'm sorry that's not
up to standard,

36:09.001 --> 36:10.617
but we'll get right to it.

36:10.652 --> 36:12.802
There's no room for that in
yachting, plain and simple.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.804
Fraser, stay right
here for five seconds.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.289
I just wanna give you
both a little rundown.

36:16.325 --> 36:18.107
Fraser, I wanna keep you
on housekeeping right now.

36:18.126 --> 36:21.011
Tidy up the master to the best
of your standards.

36:21.046 --> 36:23.630
She's really not
stoked on everything

36:23.665 --> 36:25.215
in the master at the moment.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.718
For the rest of the trip,
I'd love if you could have,

36:28.754 --> 36:30.253
like, excess attention.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.339
Pull that head of housekeeping
out of your butt

36:32.391 --> 36:33.723
and let's make sure
the master's always perfect.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.141
Yeah.

36:35.177 --> 36:36.793
-Am I okay to go?
-Yeah, you're good to go.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.261
This is delightful.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.173
I need to shine and glisten.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.275
The beach should be
ready at about 1:30.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.477
All right, ladies,
thanks so much.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.315
-I'm taking all this, yeah?
-Yes, please.

37:00.168 --> 37:02.118
-I know.
<i> -Heather, heather, fraser.</i>

37:02.153 --> 37:03.820
Do you mind meeting me
in the master, please?

37:03.855 --> 37:07.591
-Copy that, on my way.
-[bleep]

37:07.626 --> 37:09.042
-[bleep] me!
-Okay.

37:09.094 --> 37:10.060
I thought I was gonna land
on my head.

37:10.095 --> 37:11.194
What's on your mind?

37:11.230 --> 37:12.545
Did she say anything
in particular

37:12.598 --> 37:14.180
that she wasn't happy with?

37:14.216 --> 37:15.548
She just said that the little
trash thing was still there.

37:15.601 --> 37:18.051
Okay. I don't want for a
second to let you down,

37:18.103 --> 37:19.669
because I'm good at what I do.

37:19.688 --> 37:20.870
Of course.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.856
But what I need from you
in that case

37:22.891 --> 37:24.891
-is time to focus on that.
-Correct.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.443
-So, like, loving service...
-Yeah.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.478
I would do service like,
that for you 24/7.

37:28.513 --> 37:29.729
Of course.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.197
But doing both is gonna
be difficult,

37:31.233 --> 37:32.716
because I can't pick up
the slack if there is any.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.084
No, 100 percent.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.785
It was just a change of
direction last minute.

37:35.821 --> 37:36.820
No, I love it.

37:36.855 --> 37:37.954
I don't think he realizes

37:37.990 --> 37:39.456
there's a bigger picture
at play.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.758
He needs to just trust me
and my leadership,

37:41.793 --> 37:45.078
because there really is no room
in yachting for mistakes.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.429
All right, good communication...

37:46.465 --> 37:47.914
-And all of this...
-There, I like it.

37:50.135 --> 37:52.552
Nobody wants me to
get sour, trust me.

38:01.178 --> 38:03.480
I have liquor, water,
and soft drinks in there.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.048
Hop on with them.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.883
I'll take jake,
we'll leave wes on board.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.251
Okay.

38:08.287 --> 38:09.919
So, let's load the little
baby tender up,

38:09.955 --> 38:12.022
and we can start ferrying
stuff back and forth.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.089
Ready for that bow line.

38:13.125 --> 38:14.591
All right, you're free.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.626
All right, let's do this.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.979
Fraser, if I can hand
over service to you?

38:24.786 --> 38:26.803
The water's clear.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.139
Oh, this is a little
picnic area?

38:29.174 --> 38:31.241
All right, let's start
firing stuff in.

38:31.276 --> 38:32.108
Okay.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.010
-Plop 'em right here.
-I like it.

38:34.046 --> 38:35.645
We need to put these
cushions on the big chair.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.514
-That's a great idea.
-They're not the right size.

38:37.549 --> 38:38.581
Yeah.

38:38.616 --> 38:41.001
So, we don't have
enough cushions to do that.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.552
Whatever you think is best.

38:42.587 --> 38:46.389
Captain sean's methods
are definitely irregular.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.291
I'm trying to get
a job done here,

38:48.310 --> 38:50.143
but he's not even
giving me the chance.

38:50.178 --> 38:52.128
We'll start playing
with this configuration.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.513
-Okay.
-You guys go back to the boat.

38:53.565 --> 38:54.797
Okay.

38:54.816 --> 38:57.300
Relax, everything's
gonna be great.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.435
Jesus.

39:03.408 --> 39:04.407
I love you.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.109
I'm gonna tell you I love you,
like, right now.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.114
Open.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.532
Gimme a little
more slack on that.

39:12.584 --> 39:13.750
Oh, it's 1:45...

39:13.785 --> 39:15.318
I was thinking the beach
would be sooner.

39:15.337 --> 39:17.370
Yeah, so we're supposed
to be on the beach now.

39:17.422 --> 39:18.872
Something must be going wrong.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.990
-Eddie, eddie.
-Yeah, go for eddie.

39:21.009 --> 39:22.675
One more canopy tent,
we could use that.

39:22.711 --> 39:24.861
Okay, I'll grab the
third canopy tent.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.896
Are we not supposed to be
on the beach already?

39:26.932 --> 39:28.198
They're setting up camp there,

39:28.233 --> 39:30.600
so that when you arrive
it's just perfect.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.436
Ha ha!

39:33.472 --> 39:35.388
-We're getting restless.
-Okay, not to worry.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.890
<i> Eddie, eddie; eddie, eddie...</i>

39:36.942 --> 39:38.208
Can you bring me some
skinny lines

39:38.243 --> 39:40.894
so I can secure the tents
to the dock?

39:40.946 --> 39:41.895
Copy that.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.546
Okay.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.215
<i> Eddie, I've just got</i>
<i> some restless guests.</i>

39:45.250 --> 39:47.183
Can I give them,
say, 20 minutes?

39:47.219 --> 39:49.152
-Twenty minutes sounds good.
-Okay, copy that, thank you.

39:49.187 --> 39:52.188
Like, where is the fun?

39:52.207 --> 39:54.023
<i> -Eddie, eddie.</i>
-Yeah, go for eddie.

39:54.042 --> 39:56.209
<i> Cushions... Bring me four</i>
<i> of those</i>

39:56.244 --> 39:57.693
<i> and a bunch of pillows.</i>

39:57.712 --> 39:59.529
Just make it look like one
big kind of lounge area.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.081
I think it'll be a lot of fun.

40:01.133 --> 40:04.200
A lot of fun, yeah,
it's a lot of fun.

40:04.219 --> 40:05.585
I wanna shoot some people.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.470
Okay, great, I hope
I'm not one of those.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.472
Well, not like that,
that's so horrible.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.009
I just know the guests
are getting

40:13.044 --> 40:14.677
kind of itchy to get out there.

40:14.712 --> 40:18.098
They had a 1:30 time of sailing,
so we're kinda behind right now.

40:18.150 --> 40:21.184
If we can delay them
just for another half-hour,

40:21.219 --> 40:22.685
we're in great shape.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.054
Okay, we'll delay them
for another half-hour.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.823
Let's get to the beach.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.425
<i> -Eddie, eddie.</i>
-[bleep]

40:28.460 --> 40:30.627
we got a good base out here,
we need to fill in the details.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.095
Oh, jeez, oh, jeez.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.430
Get outta the way.

40:33.465 --> 40:34.798
This day is kicking my ass.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.399
Captain lee better be here soon,

40:36.418 --> 40:39.102
because I'm not gonna be able
to do an entire season

40:39.137 --> 40:41.621
with captain sean
just doing everything.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.007
<i> Hey, eddie,</i>
<i> where's the rest of our stuff?</i>

40:45.310 --> 40:46.276
Do you want me to bring
these pillows, too?

40:46.311 --> 40:47.677
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

40:47.712 --> 40:49.279
<i> -Eddie, eddie.</i>
-Goddamn, I hate this.

40:49.314 --> 40:51.347
This is such a sh-- show.

40:52.417 --> 40:53.550
[bleep]

40:53.585 --> 40:55.385
<i> eddie, eddie.</i>

40:55.420 --> 40:57.654
This season, on "below deck"...

40:57.689 --> 41:01.891
St. Kitts is absolute
tropical jungle paradise.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.660
This is nice!

41:03.695 --> 41:05.094
Welcome to the caribbean!

41:05.113 --> 41:07.997
Woo!

41:08.033 --> 41:09.799
Ah!

41:10.869 --> 41:12.802
-Bang!
-Ah!

41:12.838 --> 41:15.004
I need you to zip me up.
None of it is flattering.

41:15.039 --> 41:16.706
None of us look good.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.009
Oh!

41:22.113 --> 41:23.313
As long as it can give
me a good tip,

41:23.348 --> 41:25.315
this is gonna be
a great charter.

41:25.350 --> 41:26.950
Put the table up there...
Other way.

41:26.985 --> 41:30.720
No one else can be captain lee,
and captain lee is the best.

41:32.724 --> 41:35.458
Might be a little late,
but I'm definitely back.

41:35.477 --> 41:38.761
This charter, it's gonna
go perfect, right?

41:38.796 --> 41:41.331
Get that fender up,
get that fender up!

41:41.366 --> 41:43.766
Pull it up.
Goddamn it.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.154
I'm gonna rip someone's
----ing head off.

41:48.190 --> 41:49.522
That's my job.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.774
You want to come stay
in my bed tonight!

41:51.809 --> 41:53.943
Woohoo!

41:53.978 --> 41:55.762
Jake might be some
form of sex god.

42:01.152 --> 42:02.468
Yeah.

42:02.521 --> 42:05.455
Wes, have you ever had
a threesome before?

42:05.490 --> 42:07.156
Guys, what about this little
threesome here, yo?

42:07.192 --> 42:08.858
Yeah!

42:08.894 --> 42:12.128
Jake is gonna be, like,
the motor yacht bicycle.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.613
We're all gonna get a ride.

42:13.648 --> 42:16.566
Jake and I give kisses
on the lips to each other,

42:16.601 --> 42:17.567
is that okay?

42:17.602 --> 42:19.569
Crew romances can burn
a boat to the waterline.

42:19.604 --> 42:22.906
If you had to make out with
one person at this table...

42:22.941 --> 42:24.274
It's jess!

42:24.309 --> 42:26.075
-Ah!
-Woo!

42:26.111 --> 42:28.745
I could show him a thing or two.

42:28.780 --> 42:29.045
I would blow you
if you were straight.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.121
Is about to erupt?

42:40.291 --> 42:42.242
Get the [bleep] down
these stairs.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.243
Go [bleep] yourself.

42:43.295 --> 42:44.377
A lot of bad attitudes here.

42:44.412 --> 42:46.195
[bleep], [bleep], [bleep].
Sh--.

42:46.214 --> 42:47.714
Rethink the way you talk to me.

42:47.749 --> 42:49.382
Ow, ow, ow.

42:49.417 --> 42:52.268
If I have to do your job,
what do I need you for?

42:52.304 --> 42:53.836
Pack your bags.

42:57.058 --> 43:01.743
Everything will be great,
ah ha ha!
