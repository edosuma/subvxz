<i>"Owner of a Lonely Heart"</i>
<i>)</i>

00:28.458 --> 00:29.750
This guy should not
be on the streets.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.208
Is it such a big deal?

00:31.291 --> 00:32.375
He's twisted.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.083
What if he did
that
to Gwen?

00:34.166 --> 00:36.458
I just don't see why you have
to be the one to take the
stand.

00:36.542 --> 00:37.959
There's ten other women.

00:39.834 --> 00:43.125
I want to be the one
that stops him.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.834
How'd you get so stubborn?

01:01.208 --> 01:03.041
Sorry.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.750
Are you going
to the fires,
Daddy?

01:04.834 --> 01:07.625
That's right, pumpkin.

01:07.709 --> 01:10.417
Daddy's going
to the
firehouse.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.333
Lorraine Loomis,

01:59.417 --> 02:01.333
something
about a job in
'83.

02:01.417 --> 02:02.625
She family?

02:02.709 --> 02:04.125
I
don't
know.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.083
I just gave her coffee and
told her I'd send you over.

02:10.542 --> 02:12.041
Lorraine?

02:12.125 --> 02:14.375
I'm Detective Rush.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.125
You work the old cases?

02:16.208 --> 02:17.709
How can I help you?

02:17.792 --> 02:19.125
Uh, actually,

02:19.208 --> 02:21.333
it's my fiancee's
daughter that needs help.

02:21.417 --> 02:22.625
She's meeting me here.

02:22.709 --> 02:23.792
Okay.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.750
She's a really
nice girl,

02:25.834 --> 02:29.542
she just has some... problems.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.542
Do these problems have anything
to do with a homicide?

02:32.625 --> 02:34.709
Her mother was murdered
20 years ago.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.291
She and her father
are both

02:36.375 --> 02:37.917
haunted by it.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.542
Rob doesn't talk about it
much, but... Gwen is obsessed,

02:42.625 --> 02:44.542
and it's making her
do crazy things.

02:44.625 --> 02:47.041
Like?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.166
Oh,
here she is.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.834
Gwen. Over here.

03:01.542 --> 03:03.333
I don't know what good
this is going to do.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.000
This detective
is going to help us.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.917
I'm Lilly Rush.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.500
You want to tell me
about your mom?

03:14.583 --> 03:19.083
Her name was Dana Deamer.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.250
She got killed
by
Albert Miller,

03:21.333 --> 03:25.583
a deranged pervert that she was
about to testify against.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.333
He exposed himself to Dana.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.250
A week before
his trial,

03:30.333 --> 03:33.792
a bomb went off in her face.

03:33.875 --> 03:37.709
She lived for 16 minutes,

03:37.792 --> 03:40.333
then died in our backyard.

03:41.166 --> 03:42.375
Miller
never even

03:42.458 --> 03:44.125
got arrested.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.417
We don't always get them.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.166
I know.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.542
The first time.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.333
LORRAINE:
He's in jail now

03:52.417 --> 03:55.333
for another charge,
but he's about to be paroled.

03:55.417 --> 03:56.792
In three days.

03:56.875 --> 03:59.417
Have you been tracking him
for a while?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.625
I just turned 25.

04:01.709 --> 04:07.792
That's how old my mom was
when she died.

04:07.875 --> 04:11.000
I never
realized
till now

04:11.083 --> 04:13.750
just how young that is.

04:13.834 --> 04:16.500
So that's when
you looked him up.

04:16.583 --> 04:17.834
LORRAINE:
And ever since then,

04:17.917 --> 04:19.250
her behavior has been
a little reckless.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.500
Lorraine.

04:20.583 --> 04:21.875
We have to tell her.

04:22.834 --> 04:24.000
She's been
calling

04:24.083 --> 04:25.291
Albert Miller in jail,

04:25.375 --> 04:26.500
making threats.

04:26.583 --> 04:27.709
You don't want to do that, Gwen.

04:27.792 --> 04:29.333
GWEN:
He killed
my mother.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.208
And if nobody's going to do
anything about that,

04:31.291 --> 04:32.583
I will.

04:32.667 --> 04:35.208
How much do you remember
about the day it happened?

04:36.792 --> 04:38.625
Just parts of it.

04:38.709 --> 04:41.500
I was only five.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.041
Everybody up?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.792
Yes, but Missy
has the flu,

04:53.875 --> 04:56.000
so she stays in bed.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.083
I'll be right back
to braid your hair.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.875
Time to braid everybody's hair,

05:02.959 --> 05:05.208
everyone but poor Missy.

05:06.125 --> 05:10.583
explosion

05:16.291 --> 05:19.166
Then I went out to the back...

05:22.125 --> 05:24.083
and saw her.

05:24.166 --> 05:27.166
<i>sniffles</i>
):
I wish

05:27.250 --> 05:30.166
I would've never have done that.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.125
I'll read your mom's case.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.417
If I get new direction,

05:34.500 --> 05:36.041
I'll talk to the parole board,

05:36.125 --> 05:38.875
see if they'll hold Miller
to give me more time, okay?

05:40.709 --> 05:42.500
You can do that?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.417
I can try...

05:45.500 --> 05:49.375
but they'll be more receptive
if you stop the threats.

06:31.375 --> 06:32.542
Got a live one?

06:32.625 --> 06:33.834
At Third and Indiana.

06:33.917 --> 06:34.959
Gag gone bad.

06:35.041 --> 06:36.375
Timmy Sanders
needs backup.

06:36.458 --> 06:38.500
He always needs backup.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.291
Yeah, couple of yuppies
got jacked

06:40.375 --> 06:43.166
by some dirtballs
posing as drug dealers.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.792
But the yuppies were packing--
semi-automatics.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.458
And Fu Manchu-- runs
Chinese checkout

06:46.542 --> 06:47.625
on the corner...

06:47.709 --> 06:49.166
Pulls out
his pump-action shotgun,

06:49.250 --> 06:50.417
makes it a three-way
shoot-out.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.709
And Sanders got this?
Yeah,

06:51.792 --> 06:53.125
and you know he needs help.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.875
Guy couldn't solve
a crossword puzzle.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.125
You going to come out
and play with the boys, or what?

06:58.208 --> 07:00.625
Can't. Got a box job
to see about.

07:00.709 --> 07:02.000
Another cold one?

07:02.750 --> 07:04.083
snoring

07:04.875 --> 07:06.166
Yeah, yeah, tell that

07:06.250 --> 07:08.375
to this girl threatening
to castrate the doer.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.083
When are you coming back
on the line?

07:11.959 --> 07:13.375
Don't know if I am.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.208
When'd this job come in?

07:15.291 --> 07:16.667
'83.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.959
An '83 job can wait,
Lilly,

07:20.041 --> 07:21.959
come on.
No, it can't.

07:22.041 --> 07:23.458
It's waited long enough.

07:29.125 --> 07:32.083
Dana Deamer. A bomb was left
on her back porch

07:32.166 --> 07:33.709
inside some kind of box.

07:33.792 --> 07:36.208
She picked it up;
it went off in her face.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.500
They had a good suspect?

07:37.583 --> 07:38.917
Albert Miller,

07:39.041 --> 07:41.458
high school teacher
and chronic sexual deviant.

07:41.542 --> 07:44.000
She was scheduled to testify
against him after flashing her.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.375
But then Dana
conveniently dies.
Mm-hmm.

07:46.458 --> 07:47.875
Her daughter's
been living with it

07:47.959 --> 07:50.583
for the past 20 years,
and it shows.

07:50.667 --> 07:51.750
Damaged goods?

07:51.834 --> 07:53.375
Mm-hmm. Like it happened
yesterday.

07:53.458 --> 07:54.917
They couldn't make a
case against Miller?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.250
Couldn't place him at the scene

07:56.333 --> 07:57.709
or connect him to the bomb.

07:57.792 --> 08:01.041
Well, I hope he's not
back teaching high
school.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.250
No, he's in Graterford

08:02.333 --> 08:05.500
doing a stretch
for indecent exposure.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.500
Sweet little girl.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.875
Her dad
still
a fireman?

08:12.959 --> 08:14.542
Mm-hmm. He's
our next stop.

08:26.834 --> 08:28.417
Look, I don't want to be
any trouble.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.917
I know you've got plenty
of new homicides to deal with.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.041
We work old ones.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.291
Well, Dana's case
seemed like

08:34.375 --> 08:35.709
it should have been
open and shut,

08:35.792 --> 08:37.542
but it just slipped
through the cracks.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.959
Rob's as worried about Gwen
as I am.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.667
I'm always worried about Gwen.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.417
She's not helping herself

08:43.500 --> 08:44.917
by threatening Albert Miller.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.250
I know. She just...

08:48.333 --> 08:50.500
She never got over losing Dana.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.000
Did you?

08:53.125 --> 08:55.458
I try to look ahead
and not back,

08:55.542 --> 08:57.208
but Gwen-- she...

08:57.291 --> 09:00.125
talks about closure a lot.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.667
We're going to
see what we can do

09:01.750 --> 09:02.917
before the parole hearing.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.375
Anything you can do

09:04.458 --> 09:06.583
to keep him locked up,
I'm all for.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.959
He's a dangerous man,

09:09.041 --> 09:11.792
and my headstrong
daughter keeps
provoking him.

09:11.875 --> 09:15.417
Did he threaten Dana
in '83?
He sure did,

09:15.500 --> 09:18.000
and she still insisted
on testifying.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.291
Dana was
headstrong,
too.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.625
It was your company
that was called

09:20.709 --> 09:21.959
to the scene, right?

09:22.041 --> 09:24.583
I've responded to
a thousand fires,

09:24.667 --> 09:27.375
but when I heard
my own address...

09:30.875 --> 09:32.959
sirens blaring

09:39.250 --> 09:40.417
Mom!

09:40.500 --> 09:42.250
Mom!

09:43.208 --> 09:44.875
Mom!

09:48.125 --> 09:49.333
Maria, where's Dana?

09:49.417 --> 09:51.333
Mom's hurt.

09:59.917 --> 10:02.500
I sat next to her body...

10:02.583 --> 10:04.333
as long as they would let me,

10:04.417 --> 10:07.542
and I remember when
I finally got up,

10:07.625 --> 10:10.250
they handed me
her wedding
ring.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.917
You think you've
put something away,

10:14.000 --> 10:15.500
and then it...

10:15.583 --> 10:18.083
sneaks back sometimes.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.000
Did your company have an arson
investigator on the scene?

10:22.333 --> 10:24.000
Yeah, Frank Lawson.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.208
He's still on the job

10:26.291 --> 10:28.500
in Cedarbrook.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.166
Thanks for cooperating.

10:31.250 --> 10:34.917
Maybe you and Gwen
can finally get closure here.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.625
Rush, he's got something.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.875
Yeah?

10:44.959 --> 10:46.208
Oh, yeah.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.959
Got something good...

10:48.041 --> 10:49.458
deep in the databases.

10:49.542 --> 10:53.041
Your pervert Albert
Miller had a secret.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.709
Something they didn't get
in '83?

10:54.792 --> 10:56.083
Well, they
didn't have
Nexis

10:56.166 --> 10:57.417
or Auto-track in '83.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.542
From '78 to '82,
Miller worked summers

11:00.625 --> 11:03.041
in the mines
on the Iron Range in Minnesota

11:03.125 --> 11:04.709
working with explosives.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.500
If we can match
what he learned in those mines

11:06.583 --> 11:07.875
with evidence from the scene...

11:08.000 --> 11:09.917
Except the physical
evidence
is nowhere to be found.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.166
We need it before the hearing.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.500
I'll go to
the warehouse,

11:12.583 --> 11:14.208
myself, but the
clerk
doesn't know

11:14.291 --> 11:16.542
where anything
from the '80s
went.

11:16.625 --> 11:19.583
I think it's time
we meet Albert Miller.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.500
This crazy tomato
keeps calling me
up,

11:22.583 --> 11:24.375
saying she's
going
to shoot me down

11:24.458 --> 11:25.625
in the street
if I get out.

11:25.709 --> 11:27.667
Kind of make you regret
killing her mom?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.959
I flashed her mom
in Franklin Parkway.

11:30.041 --> 11:31.750
Flashed a hundred ladies.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.417
I didn't kill
any of them.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.709
You just threatened to.

11:34.792 --> 11:37.041
never

11:37.125 --> 11:39.041
That was a fiction.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.709
I have CSB disorder.

11:40.792 --> 11:42.041
I'm not a violent man.

11:42.125 --> 11:43.166
CSB.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.875
Compulsive Sexual Behavior.

11:46.959 --> 11:49.166
It's a psychological
condition.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.625
I shouldn't
even be criminalized.

11:50.709 --> 11:51.834
You walked naked

11:51.917 --> 11:53.542
through a girl's middle school,
Albert.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.250
That shouldn't
be
criminalized?

11:55.333 --> 11:58.458
My life became...
unmanageable.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.291
Look, I had wrong urges,

12:00.375 --> 12:01.959
but I never
blew people up.

12:02.041 --> 12:05.542
I was a high school
English teacher.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.750
What about the explosives
you worked with in Minnesota?

12:08.834 --> 12:12.291
Hey, I stuck fuses into dynamite

12:12.375 --> 12:13.458
and pushed a button.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.500
That was... that was
the extent of my job.

12:15.583 --> 12:18.458
I don't know
how to make a bomb.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.458
You didn't mention that part
of your work history

12:20.542 --> 12:22.208
to the detectives in '83,
did you?

12:23.542 --> 12:25.709
That would've been
committing suicide.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.625
Murder is more your style.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.291
Look...

12:29.375 --> 12:30.834
I'm reformed.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.083
I've made a useful contribution
in here

12:33.166 --> 12:34.667
training guide dogs
for the blind.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.333
I'm going to try
and get a job

12:36.417 --> 12:37.792
in that vein
when I'm out.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.667
I deserve parole.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.583
We'll see about that
in two days.

12:42.667 --> 12:43.750
Please...

12:43.834 --> 12:46.709
don't sink me with that.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.542
Good luck with the CSB, Albert.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.750
That guy have
murder in him?

12:58.834 --> 13:00.583
Maybe 20 years ago, he did.

13:00.667 --> 13:01.917
Hmm.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.125
<i>I check my messages, Rush.</i>

13:10.208 --> 13:11.750
You don't have to leave

13:11.834 --> 13:13.875
three voice
mails
in three hours.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.959
I really
needed you, Louie.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.875
And here I am.

13:17.959 --> 13:20.166
I'm working an old case
and the original
evidence

13:20.250 --> 13:22.709
doesn't seem to be
anywhere on planet
Earth.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.834
I would characterize
that as your problem,

13:24.917 --> 13:26.166
not mine.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.542
What's the
oldest
crime scene

13:28.625 --> 13:30.208
fresh evidence
was ever discovered
at?

13:30.291 --> 13:32.834
Lucy. 6,000 years old.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.041
Someone smashed
her skull in.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.875
Well, I've got
a 20-year-old crime scene

13:36.959 --> 13:38.709
where I think
we can find evidence.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.291
That put a bump in
your heart rate?

13:40.375 --> 13:41.417
Slightly,

13:41.500 --> 13:42.709
and I can do it in a month.

13:42.792 --> 13:44.000
How about tomorrow?

13:44.083 --> 13:46.709
I'm booked, Rush.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.375
The victim's husband
is a fireman.

13:49.458 --> 13:50.667
Civil servant like us.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.667
Uh-huh.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.041
Daughter's been
suffering over it

13:54.125 --> 13:55.500
since she was five years old.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.417
What makes you think

13:57.500 --> 13:58.875
there's anything new
to be found?

13:58.959 --> 14:00.458
See that crawl space?

14:00.542 --> 14:02.333
When the back door
was blown out,

14:02.417 --> 14:05.125
what if debris
went under the house?

14:05.208 --> 14:07.083
The guys from '83 never looked
under the house?

14:07.166 --> 14:10.041
Why would they when there was
so much debris in plain sight?

14:10.125 --> 14:13.083
That's 20 years of weather,

14:13.166 --> 14:14.250
wind...

14:14.333 --> 14:16.792
But it was all
protected by a house.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.917
It's not impossible.

14:41.083 --> 14:43.959
LOUIE:
The key areas where evidence
may have been missed,

14:44.041 --> 14:45.667
and possibly preserved,

14:45.750 --> 14:49.834
are here, here, here...

14:49.917 --> 14:51.458
and in there.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.125
You going in
that crawl space, Louie?

14:53.208 --> 14:55.083
You bet I am.

14:55.166 --> 14:59.083
Rush, Maria Sanchez
is out front.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.792
The next-door neighbor
that was first on the
scene.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.458
We got her interview
from '83?

15:02.542 --> 15:05.166
I asked her to
walk
us through it
inside.

15:08.709 --> 15:10.166
Holy mama.

15:15.208 --> 15:20.166
Such a shame, this place.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.333
No one wanted to buy
it
after what happened.

15:23.417 --> 15:24.583
This is Albert Miller.

15:24.667 --> 15:25.917
You never saw

15:26.000 --> 15:27.834
this guy in the neighborhood,
right, Maria?

15:27.917 --> 15:29.750
I should have said

15:29.834 --> 15:31.583
I saw him.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.375
Lied, you mean?

15:33.458 --> 15:35.000
Helped justice get done.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.583
But you didn't see him?

15:38.667 --> 15:40.333
Technically, no.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.166
Let's stick to the technical.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.041
Okay.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.583
Tell us what happened.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.959
It was 8:00.

15:48.041 --> 15:50.583
I was letting the dog out,

15:50.667 --> 15:53.583
when I hear the explosion...
explosion

15:58.875 --> 16:00.166
Mom?

16:05.834 --> 16:07.083
Mom...

16:08.375 --> 16:09.542
This way Gwen.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.125
Mom! Mom!

16:11.208 --> 16:16.500
Mommy!
Mommy!

16:16.583 --> 16:17.959
fire trucks approaching

16:18.458 --> 16:20.709
Mom...

16:29.083 --> 16:32.041
You didn't mention
the telephone in '83.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.875
I guess they didn't ask.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.250
You're sure about
hanging it up, though?

16:36.333 --> 16:37.709
Mm-hmm.
'Cause I remember thinking,

16:37.792 --> 16:40.333
"What if her husband
tries to call?"

16:41.625 --> 16:44.417
Okay. Thanks, Maria.

16:46.208 --> 16:48.291
Think Dana got
a prompting phone call?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.542
It's possible.

16:49.625 --> 16:50.750
Phone records.

16:50.834 --> 16:52.250
20-year-old phone records.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.959
Bell Atlantic,
Bell of
Pennsylvania,

16:55.041 --> 16:58.208
AT&T, Verizon.
Four companies ago.

16:58.291 --> 16:59.583
Should I get
an emergency subpoena?

16:59.667 --> 17:00.917
Naked aggression
would be faster.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.291
I'll call Vera.

17:10.667 --> 17:11.834
Detective?

17:11.917 --> 17:15.333
I'm Frank Lawson.
You called me.

17:17.041 --> 17:18.250
The fire marshal.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.583
Right.

17:19.667 --> 17:22.166
I think the guy under
the house wants you.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.500
You remember what you
found on this scene

17:24.583 --> 17:26.291
in '83?

17:26.375 --> 17:28.667
We discovered pretty quickly
it was an explosive device.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.000
Looked for an accelerant...

17:30.083 --> 17:32.208
Was there one?
No.

17:32.291 --> 17:33.792
It was just gunpowder.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.875
So any old hobbyist
could have made that bomb.

17:36.959 --> 17:39.208
It wasn't real sophisticated.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.458
LOUIE:
Rush!

17:40.542 --> 17:42.542
I got something.

17:42.625 --> 17:43.792
You're kidding.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.166
I am not.

17:45.250 --> 17:48.083
I'll just stick
around
in case you need
me.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.291
Thanks.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.208
Can you see it?

17:51.291 --> 17:53.166
I see something.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.709
Charred cardboard.

17:54.792 --> 17:57.083
Remnants of the box
the bomb was in.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.959
Will they have
powder residue?
It could.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.291
Could have fingerprints.

18:00.375 --> 18:01.458
Nice.

18:01.542 --> 18:02.875
It's a gold mine
under there.

18:02.959 --> 18:04.792
I'm going to be analyzing
all night.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.291
Rush...

18:06.375 --> 18:08.834
Rob Deamer's here.

18:08.917 --> 18:10.166
Wonder how he heard about this.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.834
Firemen's grapevine.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.667
I thought Rob
and Lawson were
friends.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.250
That's a thing
of the past.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.667
How you doing?

18:24.750 --> 18:26.333
I wish you would have told me
this was going on.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.875
I didn't know if
you'd want to be
here.

18:27.959 --> 18:30.166
She was my wife.
I should be here.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.709
Just trying to keep
Miller locked up,
Rob.

18:32.792 --> 18:33.959
Well, what...

18:34.041 --> 18:35.875
why would you...

18:35.959 --> 18:39.125
What are you looking for?

18:39.208 --> 18:41.667
Remnants of the explosion.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.959
20 years later?

18:43.041 --> 18:44.834
I'm an optimist.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.333
I see you
contacted
Frankie Lawson.

18:49.417 --> 18:50.959
Yeah. Is, uh,

18:51.041 --> 18:53.208
is there some kind
of problem between you two?

18:53.291 --> 18:56.542
It has nothing to do with this.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.709
I just...

18:58.792 --> 19:01.542
I think he had a thing
for my wife.

19:06.166 --> 19:09.208
Yeah, I performed the miracle
of loaves and fishes

19:09.291 --> 19:10.709
getting these telephone records.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.375
How'd you do it, Vera?

19:12.458 --> 19:13.750
I had to pistol whip a lady.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.083
She probably
deserved it.

19:15.166 --> 19:16.250
So?

19:16.333 --> 19:17.667
It's all for naught.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.041
There's no record of
any of the numbers

19:20.125 --> 19:21.291
associated
to Albert Miller

19:21.375 --> 19:22.583
calling the Deamer house.

19:22.667 --> 19:23.750
Even if Albert

19:23.834 --> 19:25.375
did call Dana that morning,

19:25.458 --> 19:27.875
why would she go get a package
he'd left for her?

19:28.917 --> 19:30.250
He was threatening her.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.709
This is exciting, Rush.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.583
Your pieces
of cardboard?

19:38.250 --> 19:40.083
No prints,

19:40.166 --> 19:41.333
no partials.

19:41.417 --> 19:42.709
I'm waiting for
the exciting
part.

19:42.792 --> 19:45.208
Watch as I put
the pieces together.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.917
They have teeny bits
of color in

19:48.000 --> 19:49.500
the uncharred areas,

19:49.583 --> 19:50.917
and when you fit
them together

19:51.000 --> 19:52.125
like a jigsaw puzzle...

19:52.208 --> 19:54.375
look, look, look, look, look.

19:57.375 --> 19:58.583
It was laundry detergent.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.959
Gleen.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.083
LOUIE:
Isn't it
kind of brilliant?

20:03.166 --> 20:05.083
It is, actually.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.709
'Cause look at the kitchen.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.291
On that shelf.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.500
Same detergent.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.792
That was her brand.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.291
Maybe no one
made a case

20:12.375 --> 20:13.959
against Albert,
'cause he didn't do it.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.291
I just cleared the pervert?

20:15.375 --> 20:16.542
Not necessarily.

20:16.625 --> 20:17.959
But how would some
random flasher know

20:18.041 --> 20:19.583
what kind of
detergent
she used?

20:19.667 --> 20:21.250
It'd have to be someone
who had been in that house.

20:21.333 --> 20:24.625
Someone closer to home.

20:24.709 --> 20:27.041
Someone she trusted.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.333
I'm not going to be able
to stop this, Gwen.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.625
You said...

20:47.709 --> 20:48.750
I'm sorry.

20:48.834 --> 20:50.166
I thought you found
evidence at the house.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.291
But it didn't

20:51.375 --> 20:52.583
support Albert
as the killer.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.583
So you got our hopes up
for nothing.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.625
This doesn't mean
I'm dropping your
mom's case, Gwen.

20:57.709 --> 20:59.417
GWEN:
I laid off this guy

20:59.500 --> 21:00.834
because you said

21:00.917 --> 21:02.959
you could help us.
door opens

21:03.917 --> 21:06.000
I pray for your family.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.834
I wish you peace,

21:07.917 --> 21:09.166
honestly.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.417
Pray for yourself.
Gwen.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.750
What?! He killed my mom

21:11.834 --> 21:13.041
and now he's walking
out the door!

21:13.125 --> 21:14.333
Baby, listen,
there may not

21:14.417 --> 21:15.625
be justice for Mom,
you just

21:15.709 --> 21:16.834
have to accept that.

21:16.917 --> 21:18.000
There must be something

21:18.083 --> 21:19.875
you can do.
There's a lot I can do.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.208
We've heard that before.

21:21.291 --> 21:22.458
I can't make guarantees,

21:22.542 --> 21:24.000
but I'm still on this job.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.625
Well, why should I trust you?
Huh?

21:25.709 --> 21:26.917
I don't even know you.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.667
No, you don't.

21:28.750 --> 21:32.333
'Cause if you did, you'd know
I was just getting started.

21:42.333 --> 21:45.208
Rush, come here.

21:47.625 --> 21:49.542
I've gone through
these logs three
times.

21:49.625 --> 21:50.709
There's no record

21:50.792 --> 21:52.458
of an incoming
call
that morning.

21:52.542 --> 21:55.792
But... you
see
this number?

21:55.875 --> 21:56.875
Yeah?

21:56.959 --> 21:59.375
Nine calls to
the Deamer house,

21:59.458 --> 22:00.875
the month
before
Dana dies.

22:00.959 --> 22:03.917
And guess who the
number traces back
to?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.625
Frank Lawson.

22:05.709 --> 22:07.041
The fire marshal.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.500
And explosives expert.

22:08.583 --> 22:09.750
He worked with Rob Deamer.

22:09.834 --> 22:11.041
Maybe he was
calling him.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.834
Hmm? But I
went through
the duty
roster.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.083
In '83?

22:15.166 --> 22:17.709
They got them going back to '68.

22:17.792 --> 22:22.333
Lawson was only calling
when Rob Deamer was at work.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.583
He knew he
wouldn't be
home.

22:24.667 --> 22:27.500
That's not so bad, Vera.

22:27.583 --> 22:28.917
phone ringing

22:29.000 --> 22:31.917
Well, I am good for something.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.834
Yeah.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.458
Why'd you
transfer out
here?

22:37.542 --> 22:38.792
Change of pace.

22:38.875 --> 22:41.000
And a 40
minute commute.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.375
I like this house.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.583
Did you stop
liking
the other one?

22:44.667 --> 22:45.792
I ask 'cause, uh,

22:45.875 --> 22:47.208
there seemed to
be some tension

22:47.291 --> 22:49.125
between you and
Rob the other
day.

22:53.458 --> 22:55.792
We drifted apart, after Dana.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.792
Were you close
with her?

22:59.875 --> 23:01.709
We got along.

23:01.792 --> 23:04.583
Got along like,
"Hey, how you
doing?"

23:04.667 --> 23:05.792
Or...

23:05.875 --> 23:08.667
got along like, uh,

23:08.750 --> 23:11.959
nine secret phone
calls in a month?

23:12.917 --> 23:15.166
That marriage was falling apart.

23:15.250 --> 23:16.792
You were Rob's friend.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.333
How's his wife end up
crying on your
shoulder?

23:19.417 --> 23:20.625
Rob wasn't a great husband,

23:20.709 --> 23:24.750
and his mom was
pretty hard on Dana.

23:24.834 --> 23:27.375
She'd tell me things.

23:27.458 --> 23:30.291
I was someone she could talk to.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.500
A friend.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.709
Were you in love
with her, Frank?

23:37.083 --> 23:39.166
DANA:
Rob's mother was here
all morning.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.291
Sitting there with her journal.

23:41.375 --> 23:43.417
Watching, writing.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.792
She went to the bathroom.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.041
I took a look.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.417
I couldn't help it.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.875
<i>music plays</i>
in the background

23:49.959 --> 23:51.208
And?

23:52.417 --> 23:54.750
"Expired apple juice
in refrigerator."

23:54.834 --> 23:57.375
laughter

24:04.542 --> 24:07.500
It was punishment
for last night.

24:07.583 --> 24:12.166
I'm in trouble 'cause I went out
without wearing my wedding ring.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.375
Why'd you do that?

24:14.458 --> 24:17.625
I just take it off sometimes,

24:17.709 --> 24:19.583
to garden or whatever,

24:19.667 --> 24:21.834
and just forget
to put it back on.

24:21.917 --> 24:23.875
But it sets Rob off.

24:23.959 --> 24:26.333
Maybe there's
a surveillance camera in it.

24:26.417 --> 24:28.709
laughs

24:28.792 --> 24:30.709
Can you tell?

24:30.792 --> 24:33.250
Could there be...

24:33.333 --> 24:35.291
a tiny microphone?

24:35.375 --> 24:37.375
I was Navy intelligence.

24:37.458 --> 24:39.875
Let me see.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.959
We can't.

24:56.834 --> 24:58.750
I know.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.542
music stops

25:05.625 --> 25:07.583
The day she died,

25:07.667 --> 25:10.750
all he could think about
was that ring.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.083
Rob?

25:13.583 --> 25:16.417
I think they were still
working on her.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.250
You know, she wasn't quite dead?

25:19.333 --> 25:21.542
And his daughter's terrified,

25:21.625 --> 25:23.667
but he's running around
looking for the ring.

25:23.750 --> 25:26.000
"Where's the ring,
where's the ring?"

25:26.083 --> 25:27.583
Like he had to have it.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.125
Are you pointing to him
as planting the bomb?

25:30.208 --> 25:32.333
No. Absolutely not.

25:32.417 --> 25:34.917
The guy she was going
to testify against did it.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.667
That's the old story.

25:36.750 --> 25:39.750
Rob and I were both at work.

25:39.834 --> 25:42.083
He was upstairs,
I was downstairs.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.417
Were there
phones upstairs?

25:44.500 --> 25:46.166
No, only where I was.

25:46.250 --> 25:48.625
So Rob didn't
call
Dana that day?

25:48.709 --> 25:49.834
I would remember that.

25:49.917 --> 25:51.750
Never left
the
building?

25:51.834 --> 25:53.375
I would remember.

25:53.458 --> 25:55.417
But you could have called Dana.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.291
Or left the building.

25:57.375 --> 25:58.917
I could have.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.125
I didn't.

26:01.208 --> 26:04.250
You were an explosives expert,

26:04.333 --> 26:06.667
and half in love with her...

26:06.750 --> 26:08.917
If I loved her,

26:09.000 --> 26:10.333
why would I kill her?

26:11.542 --> 26:14.375
It's happened
before
in human history.

26:17.834 --> 26:20.041
Lawson's interview
goes either way.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.875
I mean, she's unhappy,
wants to leave Rob.

26:21.959 --> 26:24.125
He knows it, blows her up.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.959
Or Lawson was in love with her,

26:26.041 --> 26:27.667
thinks she's going
to leave her husband,

26:27.750 --> 26:29.417
and she laughs in his face.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.500
And he knows about bombs.

26:31.583 --> 26:32.834
He used to hang
out in her
kitchen.

26:32.917 --> 26:34.083
He'd know her
detergent
brand.

26:34.166 --> 26:35.542
He wanted into her pants.

26:35.625 --> 26:36.875
He probably did her laundry.

26:36.959 --> 26:38.166
STILLMAN:
Got to keep looking

26:38.250 --> 26:39.583
at both of them, guys.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.333
Lil, I got to go.

26:43.417 --> 26:44.875
Bye.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.125
You don't have

26:47.208 --> 26:49.291
to solve this case
tonight, you know.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.542
This job is languishing.

26:50.625 --> 26:52.333
I need to pump some life
into it.

26:52.417 --> 26:53.834
Those are bank records.

26:53.917 --> 26:56.834
I'm going back to basics,
following the money.

26:56.917 --> 26:58.250
STILLMAN:
Love or money

26:58.333 --> 27:00.333
are always your best bets.

27:00.417 --> 27:01.667
And we already
checked out
love.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.208
I can't stay, Lil.

27:03.291 --> 27:04.500
You already said that.

27:04.583 --> 27:05.834
Yeah, you did.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.125
Yeah, right. Bye.

27:10.792 --> 27:11.875
Looks like

27:11.959 --> 27:13.250
you're in for a fun night.

27:13.333 --> 27:14.583
Yup.

27:28.959 --> 27:30.333
Got something.

27:30.417 --> 27:33.542
March 10, 1979-- $200.

27:33.625 --> 27:35.041
April 10, $200.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.291
Automatic deduction.

27:36.375 --> 27:37.959
Payable to the court.

27:39.166 --> 27:41.083
"By the order
of the court...

27:41.166 --> 27:42.667
"shall be deducted...

27:42.750 --> 27:44.375
"remitted monthly...

27:44.458 --> 27:46.375
"Robert Deamer to

27:46.458 --> 27:47.667
Adrian Martin."

27:47.750 --> 27:48.875
Mm-hmm.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.291
Spousal support.

27:51.375 --> 27:52.917
Did we know about Adrian Martin?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.083
Lorraine talks

27:54.166 --> 27:56.750
about Dana being his first wife.

27:56.834 --> 27:59.291
She never mentioned
a second one.

28:04.333 --> 28:05.583
It was a disaster.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.375
Rob was so
temperamental.

28:07.458 --> 28:09.083
When you're
young and dumb,

28:09.166 --> 28:10.291
that's romantic.

28:10.375 --> 28:12.583
When you're older and married?

28:12.667 --> 28:14.834
You get tired of it.

28:14.917 --> 28:17.417
He's watching,
judging
everything.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.083
Were you afraid of him?

28:19.166 --> 28:20.583
Sometimes.

28:20.667 --> 28:22.083
He was possessive.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.583
Like how?

28:23.667 --> 28:28.041
He'd always hold my hand
in public, but never in private.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.542
Like the whole
point
of it was to show

28:29.625 --> 28:31.000
others I was his.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.375
How did it finally end?

28:32.458 --> 28:34.458
My dad talked some sense
into me.

28:34.542 --> 28:35.959
Got me to pack up and go.

28:36.041 --> 28:38.166
But Rob
wouldn't
let me leave
the premises

28:38.250 --> 28:39.458
till I gave
him my ring.

28:39.542 --> 28:42.250
That was big with him,
getting the ring.

28:43.333 --> 28:45.583
I actually had high hopes
for him.

28:45.667 --> 28:46.792
phone ringing

28:46.875 --> 28:48.542
LASSING:
Why do women always

28:48.625 --> 28:50.500
have hopes for guys
who want to kill
them?

28:50.583 --> 28:52.792
Las.

28:54.875 --> 28:58.834
There's another one.

28:58.917 --> 29:00.208
Another what?

29:00.291 --> 29:02.667
Wife.

29:07.375 --> 29:10.709
It was only two years.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.333
I mean, he'd be off
my radar totally

29:13.417 --> 29:15.542
if I wasn't so traumatized
by him.

29:15.625 --> 29:17.375
Was he possessive, Pauline?

29:17.458 --> 29:21.625
Possessive, controlling.

29:21.709 --> 29:22.959
It was a fiasco.

29:23.041 --> 29:25.750
Did he make a big deal
about your wedding ring?

29:25.834 --> 29:28.417
How do you know that?

29:28.500 --> 29:30.333
quiet laugh

29:30.417 --> 29:34.208
One night,
I had gone out to dinner

29:34.291 --> 29:36.208
with an old boyfriend
from high school

29:36.291 --> 29:39.166
who was visiting,
and I came home,

29:39.250 --> 29:41.917
and he said,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
"Take off your wedding ring."

29:44.083 --> 29:46.583
I said, "Why?"

29:46.667 --> 29:50.542
He said, "Just take it off,
and you'll find out."

29:50.625 --> 29:53.792
So I took it off.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.291
He went down to the basement.

29:56.375 --> 29:58.959
He had this workshop there.

29:59.041 --> 30:00.041
And he

30:00.125 --> 30:03.125
crushed the
ring in a
vise,

30:03.208 --> 30:05.083
and then he put it
on my pillow.

30:05.166 --> 30:06.250
Oh.

30:06.333 --> 30:07.875
I figured
that was my cue to leave.

30:07.959 --> 30:10.000
Good call.

30:10.083 --> 30:12.375
What kind
of workshop did he have?

30:12.458 --> 30:15.333
Uh, he made amateur rockets.

30:15.417 --> 30:17.125
It was his hobby.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.750
JEFFRIES:
Lilly?

30:18.834 --> 30:21.000
Your pervert pal's on the line.

30:21.083 --> 30:22.250
Uh. Albert Miller?

30:22.333 --> 30:23.458
JEFFRIES:
Yeah.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.875
Apparently,
Gwen tracked him down.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.250
Excuse me.

30:28.125 --> 30:30.291
siren wailing

30:38.667 --> 30:41.583
I just paid $1,200

30:41.667 --> 30:43.417
for this piece
of crap car!
Albert, Albert.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.750
I can't pay to have
these windows fixed!
Albert.

30:45.834 --> 30:47.333
You don't want
to send this girl to jail.

30:47.417 --> 30:48.667
I don't?

30:48.750 --> 30:50.125
She grew up without a mother.
She's troubled.

30:50.208 --> 30:52.250
Look, I don't think
you did it.

30:52.333 --> 30:53.417
I didn't.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.917
sighs

30:55.000 --> 30:58.083
Look, you're flawed,
but you're not heartless.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.917
You don't want Gwen arrested,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.750
that's why you called me
when you didn't have to.

31:02.834 --> 31:04.333
Being in the
system ain't
fun.

31:04.417 --> 31:06.250
But that's where
she's going to end
up

31:06.333 --> 31:08.125
if she's so damn compulsive.
I... Albert...

31:08.208 --> 31:10.041
I know, I know.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I won't press charges,

31:14.083 --> 31:17.583
just get that loony
girl out of my life!

31:17.667 --> 31:19.041
Okay.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.291
sighs

31:31.959 --> 31:34.625
This isn't a real constructive
way to handle things, Gwen.

31:34.709 --> 31:37.291
He killed my mother.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.125
I don't care
about
constructive.

31:39.208 --> 31:40.959
I don't think
he did kill your mother.

31:41.041 --> 31:42.834
Of course he did.

31:42.917 --> 31:46.500
The bomb that killed your
mother
was in a box of Gleen.

31:46.583 --> 31:47.667
So?

31:47.750 --> 31:49.041
The person who killed her

31:49.125 --> 31:51.291
would've known
what kind of detergent she
used.

31:51.375 --> 31:53.458
That wouldn't be Albert.

31:55.125 --> 31:58.000
Someone placed a phone call
to your mom that morning,

31:58.083 --> 32:00.000
did you know that?

32:00.083 --> 32:04.500
For some reason,
there's no record
of that phone call,

32:04.583 --> 32:07.959
and I don't know
how to explain that.

32:09.166 --> 32:12.542
I wanted your
help...
getting him.

32:12.625 --> 32:13.834
Punishing him.

32:13.917 --> 32:16.000
Albert wasn't the guy.

32:16.083 --> 32:18.667
There's evidence
that points another way.

32:18.750 --> 32:21.500
What way?

32:21.583 --> 32:23.083
Towards your father.

32:24.709 --> 32:25.792
That's crazy.

32:25.875 --> 32:27.709
Put it together
in your head, Gwen.

32:27.792 --> 32:29.667
Your dad's hobby
was making rockets.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.166
Your mom and dad fought.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.667
He had two other wives.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.709
One

32:34.792 --> 32:35.875
There were two.

32:35.959 --> 32:39.166
One before
and one after your mom.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.250
I don't know
why that
matters.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.083
It reveals a pattern
of your dad's behavior

32:44.166 --> 32:46.500
that wasn't evident in 1983.

32:46.583 --> 32:47.792
Yeah, I don't understand.

32:47.875 --> 32:49.166
sighs

32:49.250 --> 32:52.125
He had controlling
relationships
with both those women.

32:52.208 --> 32:53.792
How do you know?
And he was fixated

32:53.875 --> 32:56.125
on getting their wedding rings
when it was all over,

32:56.208 --> 32:58.083
just like he was
with your mother.

32:58.166 --> 33:01.333
My dad was devastated
about losing my mom.

33:02.458 --> 33:05.041
He was hunting
for her wedding ring

33:05.125 --> 33:08.291
while she lay dying.

33:08.375 --> 33:11.166
Maria was holding your hand,
not him.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.667
knocking on window

33:21.709 --> 33:23.083
Gwen.

33:27.792 --> 33:30.125
Come on.

33:41.166 --> 33:42.750
ROB:
You're going to go too far

33:42.834 --> 33:44.125
one of these days.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.250
I need to speak
to Lorraine.

33:46.333 --> 33:47.417
No, we're leaving.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.750
It's important.
Forget it!

33:48.834 --> 33:50.083
Are you in charge
of who she talks to?

33:50.166 --> 33:51.500
Lorraine, stay in the car.

33:52.583 --> 33:54.625
Listen, I have tried
to be polite to you,

33:54.709 --> 33:56.083
but maybe you don't get polite.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.875
I get deception from you, Rob,
and aggression.

33:57.959 --> 33:59.792
Well, our family doesn't
need you, do you understand?

33:59.875 --> 34:01.291
Gwen's going to
get through
this,

34:01.375 --> 34:02.959
me and Lorraine are
going to getting
married,

34:03.041 --> 34:06.583
and we are all going to try to
get a little piece of
happiness.

34:11.542 --> 34:12.667
Is that new, Lorraine?

34:12.750 --> 34:13.875
Just this morning.

34:13.959 --> 34:15.250
ROB:
We're leaving
now,

34:15.333 --> 34:18.250
and we don't want
to see you again.

34:36.959 --> 34:38.208
Any chance of a
search warrant?

34:38.291 --> 34:40.291
For a 22-year-old hobby?

34:40.375 --> 34:41.959
Judge Fisk
really likes
you.

34:42.041 --> 34:43.583
Not that much.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.083
Rush.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.250
Hey, Gwen.

34:58.333 --> 35:00.750
Hi.

35:02.625 --> 35:05.000
Whatcha doing?

35:05.083 --> 35:08.208
I was looking around
my dad's workshop.

35:09.250 --> 35:11.375
Oh, yeah?

35:11.458 --> 35:14.583
Thinking about my mom.

35:17.417 --> 35:21.083
Have you ever seen
a pool of blood?

35:21.166 --> 35:22.333
Not just blood...

35:22.417 --> 35:25.291
but a whole pool of it?

35:25.375 --> 35:27.792
Yeah.

35:30.417 --> 35:33.625
Yeah, you can't forget it.

35:37.125 --> 35:38.417
If I'm going to do this,

35:38.500 --> 35:41.208
I'm going to have
to kill myself after.

35:41.291 --> 35:44.917
Do what, Gwen?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.458
Turn in my father.

35:51.041 --> 35:54.125
Do you have evidence
against him?

35:59.709 --> 36:04.041
I know how you make a call
without leaving a record of it.

36:06.625 --> 36:10.208
phone dialing

36:14.709 --> 36:16.583
phone ringing

36:16.667 --> 36:18.667
laughs
<i>How about England?</i>

36:18.750 --> 36:21.458
British accent
Do you know how they
talk
in England, Gwendolyn?

36:21.542 --> 36:23.000
phone ringing
No.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.542
British accent
Hello? Hello? Hello?

36:25.625 --> 36:28.417
Hello?
chuckles

36:28.500 --> 36:30.000
Ooh, I want Paris.

36:30.083 --> 36:31.583
I'll look
up
the code.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.750
<i>"Oui, madame"?</i>

36:33.834 --> 36:35.959
Wee, madame.

36:36.041 --> 36:37.542
all laughing

36:37.625 --> 36:39.250
Dana and Gwen giggling

36:39.333 --> 36:41.000
giggling fades

36:41.083 --> 36:46.333
His dad...
was a telephone repairman.

36:50.583 --> 36:54.125
How could he do that?

37:00.125 --> 37:02.917
I've seen it
a hundred times

37:03.000 --> 37:04.834
and I still don't know.

37:05.542 --> 37:07.542
sniffles

37:08.667 --> 37:11.375
Do you know
where he is now?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.792
The Poconos.

37:14.875 --> 37:16.959
With Lorraine.

37:17.041 --> 37:19.583
They're eloping.

37:42.792 --> 37:44.834
You don't have enough
to arrest him.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.875
He doesn't have
to know that.

37:46.959 --> 37:49.250
You ready, Gwen?

37:53.333 --> 37:56.333
laughing, talking softly

37:57.667 --> 37:59.834
I hope you haven't
taken the vows yet.

37:59.917 --> 38:01.041
ROB:
What's going on?

38:01.125 --> 38:02.333
We haven't met.
Detective Vera.

38:02.417 --> 38:03.667
We found Dana's killer.

38:03.750 --> 38:04.834
And?

38:04.917 --> 38:06.417
I'm sorry,
Lorraine,
I know you
thought

38:06.500 --> 38:07.750
you'd found your
happiness with
Rob,

38:07.834 --> 38:09.083
but he's not the one.

38:09.166 --> 38:10.375
Why not?

38:10.458 --> 38:12.750
Rob doesn't have much luck
with marriage.

38:12.834 --> 38:14.041
Why don't you go
sit with Gwen,

38:14.125 --> 38:15.500
she'll tell
you
the details.

38:20.792 --> 38:22.792
snaps fingers
Not you.

38:22.875 --> 38:24.375
You stay.

38:26.667 --> 38:27.875
What'd you do
to my daughter?

38:27.959 --> 38:29.166
RUSH:
Found her mom's
killer,

38:29.250 --> 38:30.375
like she asked me to.

38:30.458 --> 38:32.000
Brainwashed her is more like it.

38:32.083 --> 38:35.375
Oh, I don't know how
to
control people like
that.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.375
sighs

38:39.458 --> 38:40.750
What're they talking about?

38:40.834 --> 38:42.041
Hey.

38:42.125 --> 38:43.542
If I were a betting man,
I'd say you, Rob.

38:43.625 --> 38:44.834
You and your rocket bombs.

38:44.917 --> 38:46.291
Gwen doesn't believe that.

38:46.375 --> 38:49.375
Gwen told us how you made
the untraceable call.

38:49.458 --> 38:50.709
scoffs
Right.

38:50.792 --> 38:51.875
Okay, excuse me.

38:51.959 --> 38:53.375
I need to go
deprogram my daughter!

38:53.458 --> 38:54.542
Hey, hey, hey.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.208
Pisses you off,
doesn't it?

38:56.291 --> 38:58.625
Not knowing what they're saying,
what they're doing.

38:58.709 --> 38:59.959
Don't you pretend
that you know me.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.583
Oh, I do know you.

39:01.667 --> 39:04.333
I know you had two other
wives
you pushed around-- Pauline,

39:04.417 --> 39:05.750
Adrian.
What about them?

39:05.834 --> 39:07.417
They were the lucky ones.
They got out in time.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.583
They probably didn't talk back
like Dana did.

39:09.667 --> 39:12.166
Probably weren't
so, uh, headstrong.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.250
sighs
that,

39:15.333 --> 39:16.583
I do.

39:16.667 --> 39:18.291
I got all these opinions, ideas

39:18.375 --> 39:20.125
that might not be
the same as yours.

39:20.208 --> 39:22.917
Now, I'm just the kind of girl
that pisses you off, Rob.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.333
Just the kind of girl
you'd like to blow to bits.

39:25.417 --> 39:26.583
Are you the kind of girl
that would flirt

39:26.667 --> 39:27.959
with your husband's friends?
I might.

39:28.041 --> 39:29.959
Mouth off to his mother,
insult her to her face?

39:30.041 --> 39:31.792
Sounds about right.
Be so damn stubborn

39:31.875 --> 39:33.750
that every single conversation
turns into World War III?

39:33.834 --> 39:35.291
And on top of that, I'd be
teaching my daughter to be

39:35.375 --> 39:36.667
just as big of a
pain
in the ass as I
am.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.000
And you put up with this?

39:38.083 --> 39:39.333
Tough lady.

39:39.417 --> 39:41.083
Well, maybe you'd deserve
a lesson, too.

39:41.166 --> 39:45.208
And it was so handy having a guy
like Albert Miller to set up.

39:52.333 --> 39:59.917
slow piano intro plays

40:35.375 --> 40:36.834
on phone
Hello?

40:36.917 --> 40:38.458
distant sirens wailing
I'm sorry.

40:38.542 --> 40:40.166
Okay.

Listen, I got you something.

You did?

Yeah.
