Grandview welcomes home town hero
SGT.Matt Murphy

00:08.600 --> 00:09.600
look at this.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.700
The whole town wants to welcome him back,

00:11.800 --> 00:13.300
and he comes home in the middle of the night.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.800
Well, maybe he doesn't want all the attention.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.700
Hey, the guy got the silver star.
He should bask in the glory.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.900
Poor guy probably won't get a moment's peace.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.300
I'm just glad my buddy is back safe.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.200
You think he's gonna be different?

00:25.600 --> 00:27.900
I think two tours in iraq would change anybody,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.200
but if he just takes it slow,
gets used to being home,

00:30.300 --> 00:32.800
and doesn't come back to the firehouse
until he's absolutely ready,

00:32.900 --> 00:34.000
he's gonna be fine.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.100
- Matty.
- Hey, hey.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.400
- Welcome home, man.
- How are you, man?

00:57.600 --> 00:58.600
Let me take that for you.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.800
- We are so glad that you're back.
- Oh, it's great to be back.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.400
I swear, it's like I've never been away.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.500
Everything is just the same.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.900
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, babe.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.600
What's a few years between friends?

01:18.700 --> 01:21.000
I'm back, baby. I'm yours.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.300
Hey, matt murphy, is that you?

01:31.900 --> 01:33.900
Yo, it's matt murphy.
How you doing, man?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.100
I'm good, man. I'm good. How are you?

01:35.200 --> 01:37.100
- Good to see you. Doing great.
- Great to see you, too.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.100
- Great to see you again.
- All right, guys.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.500
Guys, there'll be time to elect
him pope over the weekend, ok,

01:41.600 --> 01:44.400
but come to the party, if you can.
Let's get out of here.Let's take him home.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.400
- See you.
- Bye.Take it easy.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.600
Man, I'm sorry to tear you away from your friends.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.800
Were you worrying them, too?

01:52.100 --> 01:53.600
Hey, come on. Give me a break.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.200
Hey, let's go and get a beer, ok?

01:55.300 --> 01:57.600
They want to go home.
They don't want company.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.400
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.500
Well, maybe it was just a car backfiring
or something.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Right.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.000
So, your place tomorrow.
What do you want us to bring?

02:18.600 --> 02:19.800
- Matt.
- Matt.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.600
Matt, what is this?

02:22.400 --> 02:23.700
You all right?

02:23.900 --> 02:25.200
Hey...

02:30.300 --> 02:34.800
Wow, I--I guess I'm still a little jumpy.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.600
- It's ok.
- Let's get you home, ok?

02:38.400 --> 02:40.500
- Yeah. We'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Ok.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.800
- Yeah.Early, right?
- Right, first thing.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.600
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.900
What just happened there?

02:52.300 --> 02:56.200
Haunting of some kind, a very noisy one,
but no one should have heard that but me.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.300
Right. What does that mean?

02:58.500 --> 02:59.700
I don't know,

03:00.800 --> 03:04.000
but I think matt brought the war home with him.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.300
So, do you think matt is
finally gonna ask gina to marry him?

03:41.400 --> 03:44.000
I don't know,
and please don't ask me to ask him.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.200
I mean,
she stuck it out with him for a long time now.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.800
They both deserve a happy ending.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.400
Yeah. Oh, listen to this.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.700
This is from the citation
matt got with his medals.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.500
"With his squad pinned down
by an insurgent ambush,

03:56.600 --> 03:59.800
"murphy braved enemy fire to retrieve a humvee

04:00.100 --> 04:02.500
"and fought his way back to his patrol
"before sustaining wounds

04:02.600 --> 04:06.000
that caused him to crash
just 10 yards short of his troops,

04:06.100 --> 04:09.100
who were killed moments later by an I.E.D."

04:10.200 --> 04:11.700
How do you get over something like that?

04:11.800 --> 04:14.300
I can't imagine what that must be like.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.399
You know, do you think that's
what I heard last night,is part of the firefight?

04:17.500 --> 04:19.700
Did you say you thought
that ghost was insurgent?

04:19.800 --> 04:22.300
Well, I don't really know.
I mean, he was wearing a head scarf,

04:22.400 --> 04:25.400
but it was more the feeling I got from him,
like anger and rage.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.800
- Maybe revenge.
- Maybe...

04:26.900 --> 04:29.600
but that still doesn't explain
why matt heard the same thing I did.

04:29.700 --> 04:30.700
Doesn't make any sense.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.100
You know, maybe his ptsd is
making this haunting different.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.100
Wait a minute.
Who says he's got posttraumatic stress?

04:36.300 --> 04:37.800
He kind of said it himself, didn't he?

04:37.900 --> 04:40.100
No. He said he gets a little jumpy
when he hears loud noises,

04:40.200 --> 04:44.700
but, I mean, let's not diagnose somebody
just because he saw a ghost.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.800
- Hey, jim?
- Yeah?

04:47.700 --> 04:51.000
You know what? Never mind.
Let's just get ready for a party.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.700
- Hey, you two.
- Hi.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.500
- Hey, buddy. How's the arm?
- Not bad.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.300
Oh, we've got that food group covered.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.700
Well, at least we're not wearing the same outfit.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.100
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna need it all.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.500
I think matt has invited everyone he's ever met.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.500
- How's it going?
- Good. Good.

05:15.700 --> 05:16.900
Yeah?

05:17.000 --> 05:20.100
Too beautiful. Made me nervous.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.800
Hey, we don't have to do this, you know?

05:22.900 --> 05:26.100
We could still take off,
you and me,go to the beach or something.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.400
Any more sausage anywhere?!

05:28.200 --> 05:30.600
And let clancy eat us out of house and home?

05:30.700 --> 05:32.800
- Hey, I heard that.
- No way.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.100
Ok. Who's hungry?

05:35.200 --> 05:37.900
Who wants some of the best burgers--

05:49.300 --> 05:52.500
- I'm so, so sorry.
- It's ok, matt.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.200
You know how much he loved you.

05:56.900 --> 06:01.300
Everyone,
this is anna sanchez and her little girl sari.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.700
Anna's husband hector was in my unit.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.300
I was lucky as hell to serve with him.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.100
He was lucky to serve with you.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
Come on. Come over here.

06:10.900 --> 06:14.100
So, this is someone I want you to meet.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.700
- Want to say hi, sari?
- Oh, she's shy.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.300
I learned how to do this
when I was away with your daddy.

06:20.400 --> 06:24.300
- Mi daddy, too.
- Daddy. Yeah. Look. Look.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.600
It could fly.

06:26.700 --> 06:30.800
- Can you say thank you to matt, sari?
- Thank you.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.100
That's ok, sweetheart.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.200
Want to go play? Yeah?

06:35.300 --> 06:36.700
Ok, everyone. Listen up.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.000
Sweetheart, come here.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.900
Ok. Well, first, I want to thank gina

06:45.100 --> 06:50.500
for so many yearsof patience
and patience and more patience.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.900
Can't imagine what you've been through, babe.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.000
Well, that's about to change.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.200
This came yesterday.
It's my discharge from the guard,

07:09.800 --> 07:12.400
so as of now, I'm officially free--

07:12.700 --> 07:16.300
no more tours, no more wars.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.300
Belong to all you people now.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.600
That's great, matt.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.000
Um, I'm gonna go get that cake out of the fridge.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.000
You know, I don't get it.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.599
They've been dating each other
half of their adult lives.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.100
He's obviously crazy about her,
and she's nuts about him.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.800
I'm starting to wonder if it has something
to do with the ghost that's haunting him.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.700
Wait. He's got a ghost?

07:49.500 --> 07:52.800
- Is everybody haunted?
- Could be, on both questions.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.300
So, do you think it has
something to do with the war?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.200
I don't know. I think it might be an insurgent,

07:57.300 --> 08:00.200
which I'm trying to find out more about,
but there's so much.

08:00.300 --> 08:04.800
Can't you just ask the ghost guy,
or is there a language barrier?

08:04.900 --> 08:06.700
Does that even happen with ghosts?

08:06.800 --> 08:08.500
Never has been before, but I don't know

08:08.600 --> 08:10.300
because I can't even get close enough to this one.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.700
You know what? Never mind. Sorry.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.900
I am trying.
I will listen to whatever you have to say,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.300
even if I can't, you know,
wrap my mind around it.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.000
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:26.900 --> 08:31.300
Look who I found in the square
getting treated to free ice cream.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.000
- Wow, the store looks great, mel.
- Thanks. Yeah.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.799
It's a bunch of new old stuff. Take a look.

08:45.500 --> 08:50.200
I, uh--I guess strawberry
is not the best flavor for me right now.

08:51.500 --> 08:55.700
Hey, don't everyone freak out.
It's ok to laugh about these things.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.800
Better than being bottled up, right?

08:58.900 --> 09:01.400
Yeah. Hey, I was thinking about
taking matt over to the firehouse,

09:01.500 --> 09:02.600
showing him the new toys.

09:02.700 --> 09:06.100
Why don't you guys go and talk,
and gina can stay here with me.We'll catch up.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.200
Come on, man.

09:07.300 --> 09:11.300
I was gonna save this for later,
but the got about 12 new video games.

09:13.100 --> 09:18.300
He's really happy to be back...
at least, most of the time.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.400
How about you?
How are you doing?

09:22.400 --> 09:23.800
It's hard.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.300
I thought that when he came back,
that we would--

09:28.500 --> 09:30.800
it's not like I had some big plan or anything.

09:30.900 --> 09:35.300
It's just, I'm so ready to take
this to the next level, you know?

09:35.400 --> 09:38.500
And now is not exactly the time
to have that conversation.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.100
Yeah.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.700
He has these bad dreams
where he talks in his sleep,

09:46.100 --> 09:49.700
and he always says, "let me go."

09:50.100 --> 09:53.400
Does he ever tell you anything specific
about what happened?

09:53.800 --> 09:55.100
No.

09:55.200 --> 09:59.200
- You mean, when I lost my guys?
- Uh, yeah.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.900
People keep asking me that.
You know what's strange?

10:06.300 --> 10:08.300
I have no idea.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.900
You mean, you just blacked it out?

10:11.000 --> 10:16.700
I mean, I remember stuff up to a point,
but after that, nothing,

10:18.200 --> 10:20.000
and part of me is scared to remember.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.600
Hey, I'm sorry I even asked.

10:21.700 --> 10:25.100
I mean, you don't have to talk about this
if you don't want to.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.700
We were on patrol,
maybe 2 or 3 clicks south of baghdad,

10:28.800 --> 10:30.700
almost ready to pack it in.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.900
Market square had been car bombed
a few days before,

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
so it was deserted, so quiet.

10:39.500 --> 10:44.800
It was weird. Then we started taking fire.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.900
- You ok?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.400
I just remembered that I need to
run downstairs and check on something,

10:52.500 --> 10:55.400
so just make yourself at home,
and I'll be right back.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.800
Ok.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.300
We try to make it back to our humvee,
but we were taking too much fire.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.500
I called for air support,
but air cav was 20 minutes out.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.300
We took cover behind that bombed-out car,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.400
and that that's when all hell broke loose.

11:20.500 --> 11:26.500
They were firing at us from everywhere.
We were pinned down, an ambush.

11:27.100 --> 11:31.400
It was chaos.
Everyone was screaming and yelling.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.100
We're taking enemy fire,
and we had to get out of there.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.900
That's all I remember,

11:41.400 --> 11:47.500
I mean, except for this feeling,
this feeling that I wanted to go.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.300
I wanted them to let me go.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.600
But, matt, getting in the humvee,
going towards your men--

11:55.700 --> 11:58.200
I'm not saying I couldn't have done those things.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.600
I just don't remember.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.900
Who are you?

12:11.900 --> 12:13.900
Incoming! Heads up!

12:15.700 --> 12:17.300
Sarge, get back here.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.500
Sergeant murphy! Matt!

12:19.600 --> 12:21.700
- Why can't you see me?
- Where's that crazy bastard going?

12:21.900 --> 12:25.000
- Listen to me. I can help you.
- Kill that son of a bitch.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.100
All right. Fall in.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.400
Stack on me. Let's go.
Go, go, go.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.200
Give my love to melinda.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
Yo, where you been?

12:57.900 --> 13:00.400
To a war,
and I was right there in the middle of it.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.700
You all right?

13:01.900 --> 13:03.900
It gets worse, and you're not gonna like it.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
What?

13:05.100 --> 13:08.200
I think matt is being haunted by his own men.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.500
This guy checks into a hotel.
Every night that he's there, at 2 A.M.,

13:14.600 --> 13:16.000
- There's a knock on the door.
- Is this a joke?

13:16.100 --> 13:17.100
Well, if you laugh, yeah.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.400
No, but every other guest that stays in this hotel
has the exact same problem,

13:21.500 --> 13:23.400
so, to make a long story short,

13:23.500 --> 13:26.600
the people that run the hotel,
they call in a bunch of,

13:26.700 --> 13:30.100
you know, paranormal experts and stuff,
and what do you think they found?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.900
A normal, rational, nonsupernatural explanation.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.300
I love this role-reversal thing we're doing.
It's great.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.200
No. Of course not.
They find the ghost of a room-service waiter

13:38.300 --> 13:41.500
who's bringing the same tray of food
to the same room at the same time

13:41.600 --> 13:44.400
every single night,
and then the groggy guest,

13:44.500 --> 13:47.800
well, he opens the door,
but the ghost is gone,laughing hysterically.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.000
Fascinating ,but what does a spirit
who plays ding dong ditch have to do

13:51.100 --> 13:52.400
with the ghost of a bunch of american soldiers

13:52.500 --> 13:54.400
fighting the same battle over and over again?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.400
Everything.
It's called an imprint haunting.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.100
It's a ghost stuck in sort of a time loop.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
They have to do the same thing
over and over and over again.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.000
- Why?
- Well, I don't know.It depends on the ghost.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.600
In the case of the room-service waiter,

14:04.700 --> 14:06.600
he's probably still waiting
for that tip he never got.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.400
So, they fight the same battle over and over again,

14:08.500 --> 14:10.000
just hoping for a different outcome?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.300
Well, yeah, and in the case of your soldiers,

14:12.400 --> 14:15.300
maybe something happened to them over there
that they can't accept,

14:15.400 --> 14:17.500
maybe like getting blown up.
I'm not trying to be funny.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.200
I mean, I know humor is the first casualty of war.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.500
The quote is,
"truth is the first casualty of war."

14:22.600 --> 14:25.700
You're right.You're right.
Truth is the first casualty of war.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
It's amazing. It's like two heads, one brain.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.600
You said the ghosts were angry at their sergeant,

14:29.700 --> 14:31.300
- your friend the hero.
- Yes,very.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.000
Ok. Well, if truth is the first casualty of war,

14:34.200 --> 14:36.900
maybe something happened
with the way that they died

14:37.000 --> 14:38.800
that made them follow that sergeant home.

14:38.900 --> 14:42.500
- Like the truth about how they died.
- Or why they died.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.100
Anyway, I'm sure whatever information you get

14:45.200 --> 14:48.700
will be a lot more informative than
this investigation they have going.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.500
- What investigation?
- I'm sorry.I assumed that you knew.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.000
"Why has the family of one
of grandview's slain soldiers

14:56.100 --> 15:00.500
"petitioned the pentagon for an investigation
into the incident? Stay tuned."

15:04.300 --> 15:06.300
- This is hector?
- Yes.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.300
He's the one next to matt--rocky.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.900
And what are all these nicknames?

15:12.200 --> 15:15.800
Money is money
because he never loses a game at poker, like, ever.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.100
Lucky picked up that name because

15:18.200 --> 15:22.800
he only lost two fingers in a roadside bombing
during his last rotation.

15:22.900 --> 15:25.300
And hector? Why rocky?

15:25.400 --> 15:27.900
Because they used to kid him
that he'd done more tours in iraq

15:28.000 --> 15:29.900
than there were "rocky" sequels,

15:30.400 --> 15:33.100
which was funny until-- you know.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.900
I'm sorry if I came at a bad time.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.700
It's all right. I just have class at 4:00.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.000
It's the only thing keeping me sane right now.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.300
I don't want to keep you,
but I just want to ask you--

15:46.700 --> 15:48.200
do you know where--

15:48.800 --> 15:51.500
melinda, this is richard, hector's father.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.700
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.800
Melinda is a friend of matt'S.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.800
Oh.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.300
Do you know where the county
tax stuff for last year is?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.700
Above the file cabinet out back.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.100
Thank you.

16:08.300 --> 16:13.100
He came down from boston
to stay with me and help out.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.700
He's going through all the finances.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.700
I was doing it, but

16:18.800 --> 16:23.000
I started finding all these notes
that hector wrote to himself, you know,

16:23.100 --> 16:25.300
all the plans he had for us.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.600
- This must be so hard for you.
- Not just for me.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.400
I don't want you to think that I'm prying,

16:31.500 --> 16:35.000
but I did hear that one of the families
has asked for an investigation.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.300
Richard asked for it.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.100
Do you know why?

16:42.100 --> 16:46.400
Like I said, it's not just me
that's having a hard time.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.200
Richard, he's angry. He wants reasons.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.300
Don't you?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.900
Reasons aren't gonna bring my husband back.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.800
Do you think he would mind if I talked to him

16:54.900 --> 16:56.300
about why he's doing this?

16:56.600 --> 16:58.700
- Why?
- I don't know...

16:58.900 --> 17:01.900
just in case I can help in some way.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.600
He's out back.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.300
You don't really understand
what's going on here, do you?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.300
Do you have something against matt?

17:07.400 --> 17:09.099
Yeah, just the death of my son, that's all.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.700
I don't understand. Did matt somehow--

17:10.800 --> 17:13.400
look. If you know this guy,
you shouldn't be talking to me.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.700
It's all gonna come out soon enough.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.300
What's gonna come out?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.700
- You think you know murphy?
- Yes, and so does my husband.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.800
Come and take a look at the real sergeant murphy.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.500
- What is this?
-Terrorist web site, a jihadi recruitment tool.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.700
They post videos of american
soldiers being killed.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.800
Oh, that is awful.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.000
I was a colonel in the gulf war.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.100
I still have friends in the nsa.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.600
Buddy of mine sent me this link.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.600
Government doesn't want this to get out.

17:43.700 --> 17:48.000
There, the one trying to stop sergeant murphy,
that's my son.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.000
- What's going on?
- Hard to say.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.200
Sergeant murphy seems to be
in some kind of argument with his men.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.800
That's my boy who's keeping him from getting up.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.200
- Why?
- Keep watching.

17:59.600 --> 18:04.800
Sarge! Stop him! Stop him!
Where's that crazy bastard going?

18:04.900 --> 18:07.600
He makes it to the humvee,

18:07.800 --> 18:10.100
and he doesn't even wait for his men.

18:17.700 --> 18:22.100
He abandoned his men under fire,
and he left my son to die.

18:24.600 --> 18:29.000
Come on. Stack on me.
Let's go. Go, go, go.

18:42.900 --> 18:48.400
I sat here and watched my son die a hundred times,

18:50.600 --> 18:52.700
and murphy gets a medal.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.800
What are you planning to do with this?

18:54.900 --> 18:59.100
People who gave murphy his silver star
don't want to see this.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.200
Tomorrow I'm giving it to the press.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.100
- You will ruin matt's life.
- He has his life!

19:05.200 --> 19:09.200
Couldn't there be an explanation of
what happened on the video?

19:09.300 --> 19:11.900
- Such as?
- Well, I don't know...but, you know,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.500
maybe if you gave me some more time,
I could figure out what really happened.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.800
From who--the military,murphy?

19:18.200 --> 19:21.000
- Who's gonna tell the truth?
- I am begging.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.500
Please give matt some more time.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Maybe his memory will come back,

19:27.100 --> 19:30.000
and you're gonna lose nothing by waiting.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.000
I'll hold off another day.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.600
You should use that time
to let murphy know what's coming down.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.500
That'll jog his memory.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.400
Matt.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.600
Gina?

19:49.700 --> 19:51.600
Hey, man, you home?

19:54.600 --> 19:58.900
Matt. Gina?Anybody home?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.600
Hey, buddy, I thought we'd play some ball.

20:02.700 --> 20:06.500
Since you only got one good arm,
maybe I stand a chance this time, huh?

20:06.700 --> 20:10.200
Matt. Matt, where are you, man?

20:13.700 --> 20:15.800
- Matt...
- close the door. Close the damn door.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.200
Matt, the door is closed.
What a yreou doing?

20:18.900 --> 20:20.100
Matt...

20:20.600 --> 20:22.000
lock the door. Lock the door.

20:22.900 --> 20:26.300
The doors are closed, ok?
Take easy

20:26.400 --> 20:27.800
Lock the door. Lock the door.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.000
Come on. Tell me what's wrong.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.200
Matt, put the gun down.Put the gun down.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.600
It's ok. Good.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.700
I'm just gonna take it.
I'm gonna take the gun from you, that's all.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.600
Easy.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.500
Get away from my--

20:46.600 --> 20:49.700
buddy, you're having a panic attack.
Take it easy.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.400
Breathe. Breathe. Try and calm down.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.600
Matt, nobody is gonna hurt you.

20:54.700 --> 20:58.400
- I lied! I lied!
- Lied about what?

20:58.500 --> 21:00.900
When I got off the bus and told you
it was like I was never away.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I feel like I never left iraq.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.300
I can't come home, no matter how hard I try.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.700
You are home now.You have people
who care about you,people who love you.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.900
No one is gonna let anything happen to you.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.300
Come on.You're safe now.

21:28.900 --> 21:31.100
I was so scared.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.800
I've never been scared, not like this.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.400
I keep seeing them, jim--my men.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.100
It's like theyree he'R.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.000
They know it should be me
that's d d,eaand not them.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.900
They're coming to get me.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.700
guy is in trouble, mel.
I don't know how much more he can take,

21:55.800 --> 21:57.900
and if this is all because of those ghosts,

21:58.300 --> 22:00.900
you got to make them disappear, I mean, like, now.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.800
- You know it's not that simple.
- Why not?

22:03.800 --> 22:06.000
Why does it have to be about
what happened that night?

22:06.100 --> 22:09.200
Because the haunting is just a symptom,
and you know that, too.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.600
There's always something underneath it.
I wish there wasn't, but there is.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.300
I know this guy through and through.
He saved my life on the job.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.500
I mean, the man is a hero.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.400
Ok, so what are you afraid of?

22:18.500 --> 22:22.000
Whatever we find out about matt,
you're still his friend.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.500
We're his friends, so we'll help him.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.100
Well, how you gonna help him?

22:29.900 --> 22:33.900
I think matt is feeling the hauntings
because he's so bonded to his men.

22:34.200 --> 22:38.000
They get to a point
where they can experience each other's feelings,

22:38.200 --> 22:42.400
even death, and every time that he
tries to remember what happened,

22:42.500 --> 22:46.000
the ghosts come,
just not clearly enough for me to reach them.

22:46.100 --> 22:49.700
All right, so he has to remember better
for them to pass through.

22:49.800 --> 22:54.300
He has to remember everything,
even if it triggers another attack.

22:54.400 --> 22:58.000
I have to reach them in order to cross them over.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.000
Ok. Well, how do you make him remember?

23:02.200 --> 23:04.600
I have to show him something.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.700
Come on. Stack on me.
Let's go.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.300
Go, go, go.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.600
Do you remember any of it?

23:18.800 --> 23:22.900
At least now I know
why I keep hearing myself saying, "let me go."

23:23.700 --> 23:27.400
No. No.
There has to be some other explanation for this.

23:27.500 --> 23:30.300
My guys are dead.
I mean, you saw what happened.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.700
I ran. I abandoned my men under fire.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.100
I'm alive. What other explanation could there be?

23:35.200 --> 23:39.800
Matt, hector's father is gonna go to
the press with this tomorrow.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.500
You need to remember more.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.400
It should've been me.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.400
Ow! Kill that son of a bitch.

24:22.500 --> 24:26.600
Hector, I need to talk to you.
I can help you.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.400
Rocky! Rocky!

24:31.700 --> 24:34.100
Your wife told me that's what everyone calls you.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.400
- Anna told me.
- Anna?

24:44.300 --> 24:46.500
Yeah.Matt wants you to know how sorry he is.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.200
He wishes that he could take back what he did,

24:48.300 --> 24:50.700
but he can't change what happened,
and neither can you.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.700
You don't belong here.
You all need to cross over.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.000
- He said I'd know what to do.
- Who? Who said that?

24:57.100 --> 24:59.400
Gonna kill that son of a bitch.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.900
- What are you looking for?
- He said I'd know what to do.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.200
- No. Wait.
- All right. Fall in.

25:07.300 --> 25:10.600
Stack on me. All right.Go, go, go.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.300
Moving.

25:29.300 --> 25:33.200
Mommy is almost finished,ok, sweetie?
Then it's me-and-you time.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.700
Yeah.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.400
- Hector?
- Daddy.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.600
That sounded just like the way your daddy
would bang through the door.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.200
Used to drive me crazy.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.100
Dada.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.300
Oh, baby girl, I know. I miss daddy, too.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.700
When I get done with my homework,

26:02.800 --> 26:05.300
we'll got to the park and do what you want,
ok, sweetie?

26:05.400 --> 26:06.700
Daddy.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.500
- Dada.
- You stay here, sweetie.

26:20.300 --> 26:22.300
Dad, is that you?

26:24.500 --> 26:25.900
Dad?

26:31.300 --> 26:36.600
Hi, anna.I'm so sorry to bother you,
but could I talk to you for a second?

26:36.700 --> 26:38.700
Sure. Come in.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.700
- Everything ok?
- Yeah.

26:43.300 --> 26:47.200
- Daddy.
- Sari? Sari?

26:53.700 --> 26:55.500
Sari.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.700
- Daddy.
- Baby.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.700
Come on, sweetie.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.100
Come here, baby. Come here.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.600
What are you looking for?
We don't have much time.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.200
He gave it to me.

27:12.800 --> 27:15.000
- He said I'd know what to do.
- What is it?

27:15.100 --> 27:17.100
- It's an envelope.
- What's in it?

27:18.700 --> 27:20.700
I never got to open it.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Go, go, go.

27:29.400 --> 27:34.300
What the hell is going on?
Who were you talking to?

27:34.400 --> 27:37.200
Ok. Just please trust me
that I will explain everything.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.200
- There's something I have to find.
- What?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.500
I don't know exactly,

27:40.600 --> 27:44.400
but I needoko lo t at anything of hector's
that was sent back from iraq.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.800
- Why?
- Please.

27:47.900 --> 27:52.700
I gave the box to hector's father.
I don't know where he put it.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.400
- Jim?
- Gina called me 5 minutes ago.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.600
She said matt is a mess.
I'm on my way over there right now.

27:57.700 --> 27:59.300
Yeah. I'll meet you.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.100
- Where's matt?
- He left.

28:10.300 --> 28:13.300
I tried to get him to talk to me,
to tell me how he was feeling,

28:13.400 --> 28:16.500
- to tell me anything.
- Gina, where'd he go? Do you know?

28:16.600 --> 28:19.600
I don't know.
He kept talking about that video.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.200
He hated that you guys saw it.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.600
He said that now you would know
that he was a coward, too,

28:23.700 --> 28:26.900
and so would everybody else
as soon as it was made public.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.700
- He's not a coward.
- We know that, gina.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.300
We're gonna find him. He's gonna be ok.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.800
- I'm afraid that--
- what?

28:33.400 --> 28:38.500
After he left, I went to check for this gun.
It's gone.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.100
I got him.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.900
I need your help.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.900
The video is going out.
I kept my word. Now it's time.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.900
It has nothing to do with the video.

28:55.100 --> 28:59.000
I think your son may have been carrying something
when he died that was given to him by matt.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.800
- So what?
- I need to find out what it is

29:00.900 --> 29:02.200
because matt's life depends on it.

29:02.300 --> 29:03.500
What the hell are you talking about?

29:03.600 --> 29:06.100
Show her, dad.
Let her look through my things.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.000
Hector would want it. Please trust me.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.700
Since when do you speak for my son?

29:11.900 --> 29:15.400
Now, everything they sent me of his
is locked up out back in storage room.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.900
Anna is not ready to look through it.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.800
You know, is anna home?
Because maybe we--

29:19.900 --> 29:24.200
anna took sari to the store.
She was a nervous wreck when I got home.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.300
I want you to stay away from her.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.900
Hey! Hey!

29:33.100 --> 29:35.800
Are you nuts? Do I have to call the cops?

29:50.200 --> 29:51.800
It's hot.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.500
How is that possible?

29:55.600 --> 29:59.500
Please trust me when I say this.

30:00.100 --> 30:03.600
I think your son wants you
to find what matt gave to him.

30:28.300 --> 30:30.500
This is all I have left of my son.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.900
I said that anna wasn't ready to look through it.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.800
It's really me who isn'T.

30:42.400 --> 30:47.300
I keep thinking that if I don't open the box,

30:48.600 --> 30:51.000
it's like it's not really final.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.000
I won't see the end of my son.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.400
I am so sorry.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.900
My jacket--

31:26.400 --> 31:28.500
my right vest pocket.

31:29.800 --> 31:34.700
Maybe you should check his jacket--
right vest pocket.

31:58.800 --> 32:02.900
I wasn't afraid, dad.
I know I wasn'T.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.000
Told me how to be tough, and I was.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.100
You should know he wasn't afraid.

32:11.400 --> 32:14.800
He was tough, just like you taught him to be.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.600
I don't understand any of this.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.900
"Until I get home!"

32:47.900 --> 32:49.900
Is this what you're looking for?

32:55.800 --> 32:58.100
What does this all mean?

32:59.300 --> 33:03.000
- Matt. He needs us right now.
- Where?

33:03.100 --> 33:05.000
Where the names are in the village square.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.400
Can I keep this?

33:09.700 --> 33:11.900
yeah

33:19.300 --> 33:23.200
Come on. You remember when you were a rookie.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.300
You were as green as this grass here,

33:25.400 --> 33:31.000
but you plucked me off that fire escape
without a second thought.You saved me,

33:31.400 --> 33:34.600
and that wall came crashing down.
I remember, you didn't even blink.

33:36.900 --> 33:39.900
I don't know who that guy was,
but it wasn't me.

33:41.400 --> 33:47.400
It wasn't the guy who let his patrol die
in some bombed-out square in iraq.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.500
You saw ityo .U know.

33:51.600 --> 33:55.800
I don't care what I saw
or what I didn't see on that videotape.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.300
I know who you are.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.800
This whole town knows who you are.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.300
Nice try, pal.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.100
I appreciate it. I really do.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.300
This isn't about who I am.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.699
It's about what I am.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.400
Matt, what are you doing here?

34:24.500 --> 34:26.300
What do you want?

34:29.000 --> 34:30.699
You know what I want, jim?

34:36.600 --> 34:39.100
I want to know why I left my men behind.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.600
I want to know why I can't remember what I did

34:42.800 --> 34:45.300
and why I keep doing this.

34:46.199 --> 34:48.400
Most of all,

34:49.199 --> 34:52.699
I want to know why they're dead and I'm not.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.100
Matt, I went to hector's house.
We found this.

35:00.300 --> 35:03.600
You gave it to him
right before you got in the humvee.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.800
What does it mean?

35:16.300 --> 35:20.800
You know,these reeds
grow everywhere in the south of baghdad.

35:23.600 --> 35:28.600
One day, I was just playing with them,
and I made this.

35:29.400 --> 35:33.600
- That's a ring?
- An engagement ring.

35:34.300 --> 35:38.700
It was supposed to be a placeholder
till I could get her a real one.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.500
Why'd you give it to hector?

35:40.600 --> 35:43.800
Because he thought he was
one a one-way trip in the humvee.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.900
You thought you weren't coming home.

35:47.100 --> 35:50.700
That day that you got in the humvee,
you weren't running scared, were you?

35:51.500 --> 35:54.000
You were on a suicide mission for your men.

35:54.100 --> 35:55.400
How'd you know that?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.000
Hector,

35:57.500 --> 36:02.400
your men, they're here with you,
with us right now.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.400
Rocky?

36:12.800 --> 36:14.200
Why?

36:14.400 --> 36:17.000
Because we don't leave a man behind,

36:17.100 --> 36:19.900
especially when he never left us.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.700
They said you never left them.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.300
What happened?

36:27.500 --> 36:32.100
We got separated from our convoy,
pinned down in that square.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.600
He radioed for air cover.
There just wasn't enough time.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.500
get down!get down!

36:38.300 --> 36:41.900
- Where's the fire coming from?
- Storefront across the street, sarge.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.500
We got another one,11 o'clock.

36:43.600 --> 36:47.500
Rocky, the gun nest behind that wall--
2, maybe 3 shooters.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.800
Can't move.
What are we gonna do?

37:04.700 --> 37:06.100
What are you doing, man?

37:06.200 --> 37:08.600
- You'll know what to do.
- What?

37:08.700 --> 37:11.100
Sarge. Matt,get down, man.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.600
- Stop it!
- Let me go!

37:12.800 --> 37:13.800
Someone stop him!

37:13.900 --> 37:17.900
Kept trying to pull you back.
You just kept saying,"let me go."

37:18.000 --> 37:19.600
I remember.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.600
I couldn't take the time to explain it
because if I did--

37:24.700 --> 37:26.700
we wouldn't have let you go.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.900
- Stop murphy!What's that crazy bastard doing?
- Matt!

37:30.000 --> 37:31.700
I knew they were confused.

37:31.800 --> 37:35.200
All I could do was say a prayer that I'd
make it to the humvee without getting killed.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.700
Sarge!

37:45.500 --> 37:50.200
He drove straight into enemy fire.
He was sacrificing himself to save us.

37:55.700 --> 37:59.200
Two jihadis left. I got the first one.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.700
Then my gun just jammed.

38:02.800 --> 38:06.200
That's why you keep breaking it down
and putting it back together again.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.200
Yousre ju't trying to unjam it.

38:08.300 --> 38:11.400
Fall in. Stack on me.
Let's go. Let's get sarge.Go, go, go.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.100
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that was it.

38:17.100 --> 38:20.300
My ticket was about to
be punched by the last gunman.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.700
And then hector took out the last shooter.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.200
You know, we came to save him.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.500
They were coming to rescue you.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.100
NO!!!

38:53.800 --> 38:58.600
But they never made it.
Couldn't accept it.

38:58.700 --> 39:04.300
It was like a part of my brain just shut down.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.600
Should've left me.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.900
It should've been 4 survivors and 1 casualty
instead of the other way round.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.700
He saved us.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.800
There was no way we were leaving without him.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.200
The rest of it?Nobody had any control over
what happened next.

39:23.300 --> 39:27.100
I would've done anything for them,anything.

39:27.900 --> 39:30.300
I'd trade places with them in a heartbeat.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.300
You tell matt that he's alive for a reason

39:32.400 --> 39:34.800
and that he shouldn't waste
it feeling guilty about us.

39:34.900 --> 39:39.900
Everything that happened was meant to happen.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.800
Hector wants you to stop blaming yourself.

39:44.900 --> 39:50.200
You did everything you could.
Everything happens for a reason.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.900
Whoa, that's bright.
Is that a chopper?

39:55.000 --> 39:58.800
No. No. That's not a searchlight.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.200
It's beautiful.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.300
What does it mean?

40:03.800 --> 40:06.200
It means you're ready to go.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.800
Tell anna I love her.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.300
Tell her not to let my little girl
forget about her dad.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.200
I will.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.000
Talk to my father.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.100
Ask him if he thinks matt didn't try to save us,

40:23.200 --> 40:26.100
then why are there bullet holes
in the front grill of our humvee?

40:27.300 --> 40:30.900
It's because matt was going towards the bullets,
not away from them.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.400
You tell him that
I want him to watch out for matt now

40:35.500 --> 40:38.200
the way matt watched out for me.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.900
He's the one that's gonna need help now.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.700
What's happening?

40:47.800 --> 40:50.600
They did what they came here to do.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.000
They said good-bye.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.400
I've been looking everywhere for you.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.500
Sorry.

41:22.600 --> 41:25.600
Don't ever leave me again.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.800
What part of "I love you" don't you get?

41:31.600 --> 41:37.000
- I'm with you.
- I know.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.700
This is all I can give you right now.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.300
Now, we'll replace it when we--

41:57.400 --> 42:00.000
don't you dare.
