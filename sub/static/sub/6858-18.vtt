00:17.684 --> 00:18.767
ANNOUNCER: Captured!

00:18.852 --> 00:21.270
Returning from a perilous assignment
in the Outer Rim,

00:21.771 --> 00:25.733
Jedi Master Even Piell's cruiser
has fallen under attack and been boarded.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.985
Seeking vital information he carries

00:28.069 --> 00:30.946
about secret hyperspace lanes
called the Nexus Route,

00:31.031 --> 00:33.282
Separatist forces have taken him alive.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.201
Now, the Jedi are preparing
a stealth mission

00:36.286 --> 00:39.997
into the heart of Separatist space
in an effort to rescue Master Piell

00:40.081 --> 00:43.292
from the deadly prison
known as the Citadel.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.255
As you are aware,
the Citadel is their most isolated

00:48.339 --> 00:50.716
and impenetrable detention facility.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.052
No one has ever escaped.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.970
There's a first time for everything.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.472
Indeed there is.

00:56.848 --> 01:00.684
Their security has prevented our probes
from obtaining recent reconnaissance,

01:01.311 --> 01:03.145
so we've been forced
to construct a crude map

01:03.646 --> 01:05.564
based upon data from the archives.

01:06.483 --> 01:10.527
And since the data is extremely old,
the map will be difficult to rely on.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.821
So we're essentially going in blind.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.698
Beg your pardon, General,

01:14.824 --> 01:16.700
but how do we know
Master Piell is still alive?

01:17.494 --> 01:20.954
The Separatists won't dare kill Master Piell
until they have what they need.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.456
He obtained the coordinates

01:22.499 --> 01:25.167
of a secret hyperspace lane
known as the Nexus Route

01:25.794 --> 01:30.297
which travels into the heart of both
the Republic and Separatist homeworlds.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.800
They could prove vital
in maneuvering our forces

01:32.842 --> 01:34.635
deep into remote Separatist sectors.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.346
Or the enemy could use them
to slip through our defenses

01:37.388 --> 01:38.722
and attack Coruscant.

01:38.890 --> 01:42.684
These hyperspace lanes are of
immense interest to both our sides,

01:43.353 --> 01:47.064
and could tip the scale of the war
to whomever is in possession of them.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.191
That is all.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.696
Based on the archive schematics,
we've narrowed it down

01:54.781 --> 01:57.866
to three possible locations
they could be holding him at.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.203
My greatest concern is infiltrating
their outer security.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.206
The life-form scanners
will not be easy to fool.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.375
I've got a thought about that.

02:06.835 --> 02:10.504
Master! I'm sorry I'm late.
I just heard about the briefing.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.422
We're going to rescue Master Piell, right?

02:16.302 --> 02:18.554
You two have much to discuss.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.392
Ahsoka, I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier,

02:24.269 --> 02:25.978
but you won't be coming along on this one.

02:26.062 --> 02:29.356
Not coming?
But you're breaking into the Citadel!

02:29.524 --> 02:30.899
No one's ever done it.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.694
The Citadel wasn't designed
to hold common criminals.

02:33.736 --> 02:37.072
It was created to hold Jedi
if any of us lost our way.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.408
It's not a place for Padawans.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.077
You're just being protective again.

02:42.495 --> 02:46.540
That's not fair. How am I supposed to learn
if you won't let me share the risk?

02:46.958 --> 02:50.252
This isn't a mission for learning.
You either do or die.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.255
And that's not a risk I'm willing to share.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.723
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

03:03.433 --> 03:07.728

You're being followed by battle droids!

03:08.271 --> 03:09.938
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

03:09.981 --> 03:13.275

(R2-D2 CHIRPING)

03:27.457 --> 03:29.124
Don't you go thumbing your gears at me

03:29.167 --> 03:32.920
just because you have a bunch of
dim-witted droids following you about!

03:33.087 --> 03:34.129
Really.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.051
We're trusting those droids
to get us into the Citadel?

03:39.135 --> 03:43.472
It's the only way. We're flying right
into the heart of Separatist territory.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.557
Droids won't be detected.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.146
Artoo.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.023
Make sure they don't stray
from the flight plan.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.901
It's all under control, sir.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.986
I was talking to Artoo.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.160
Master Plo? May I speak with you?

04:05.912 --> 04:07.454
What is it, little 'Soka?

04:08.164 --> 04:12.000
It's about the mission.
Master Skywalker doesn't want me to go.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.504
That is his choice.

04:17.715 --> 04:21.134
I know.
But I think he's being overly protective.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.680
He's picking and choosing
which assignments I can be a part of.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.307
He is your master.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.853
Yes, but it's not for him to decide

04:31.938 --> 04:34.356
when and how
I should put my life in danger.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.316
That should be my choice.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.656
I've never been carbon-frozen
before, General.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.825
It's the first time for us, too.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.706
This is your idea? Carbon freezing?

04:51.040 --> 04:54.209
Hey, you wanted to shield us
from the life-form scanners.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.462
Are we sure this thing is safe?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.048
I don't want to end up a wall decoration.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.719
Try to relax.
We'll be unfrozen as soon as we arrive.

Make sure every part of that ship
is scanned for life forms.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.187
Yes, Commander.

06:37.605 --> 06:42.150
Make no mistake. The Jedi will be
coming for their imprisoned brother.

06:42.944 --> 06:46.196
They're not about to let
one of their own be tortured

06:46.280 --> 06:51.284
into handing over information that will
help the Separatists win the war.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.286

06:54.080 --> 06:55.831
What is our cargo?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.083

The shuttle has no life forms, Commander.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.130

training against it.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.229
But at the Citadel,
breaking Jedi is our specialty.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.192
Within these walls,
they will learn to fear us.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.403

Your eyes are fine.
It's Ahsoka's hearing that needs help.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.626
I received orders to join the team.
I thought you knew.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.586
Orders? From who?

09:06.629 --> 09:08.922
I discussed it with Master Plo.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.632
He didn't tell me.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.009
You were already in carbonite.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.346
Well, I gave you a specific order
not to come!

If there's one thing I've learned
from you, Master,

09:20.184 --> 09:24.479
it's that following direct orders isn't
always the best way to solve a problem.

09:24.814 --> 09:29.025

is to "Do as I say, not as I do."

There's nowhere to put a grappling hook
at that height,

I hear something.

18:01.789 --> 18:02.830
(GROANING)

18:11.215 --> 18:12.340
General.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.841
Captain Tarkin.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.511
I never thought I'd see you again.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.513
And you brought friends.

18:18.555 --> 18:22.183
Tarkin, this is Obi-Wan Kenobi
and Anakin Skywalker.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.853
Well, now that you've found us,
how do you expect to get us out?

18:25.979 --> 18:29.482
If they've locked this fortress down,
there's at least ten squads on their way.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.943
It's going to be impossible to escape.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.738
What if we split up?
My team will create a diversion,

18:35.864 --> 18:39.659
while Anakin leads the others away.
That way, if one of us is captured,

18:39.743 --> 18:43.079
the enemy will only have part
of the information and not all of it.

18:43.580 --> 18:47.041
General Kenobi, I think it's better
if we stick together.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.335
A stronger force
would have a better chance

18:49.378 --> 18:52.713
-of protecting the information.
-Not in this situation.

18:53.048 --> 18:57.510
But surely we'd have more strength
in numbers, rather than divide us.

18:58.011 --> 19:02.431
Obi-Wan has a point. I'll go with him,
you go with Skywalker.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.155
(BOMBS CHARGING)

19:28.041 --> 19:29.292
They escaped, sir.

19:31.628 --> 19:36.966
Captain, show this droid what happens
when we use that word.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.099
Sir! They've been spotted
heading for the upper levels.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.602
They're trying to steal a transport.

19:48.228 --> 19:52.565
Seal the landing platform
and send all battalions to their positions.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.318
Bring them back alive.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.074
Hey!

20:09.249 --> 20:10.458
(EXPLODING)

20:22.346 --> 20:23.346
(BEEPING)

20:33.398 --> 20:34.565
(LIGHTSABER WHOOSHING)

20:37.819 --> 20:38.945
Everybody in.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.000
This is one of the original fortress tunnels.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.878
The advantage of old archive data.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.716
The tunnel's clear!

21:01.343 --> 21:05.179
Looks like Obi-Wan's distraction worked.
Things seem to be going as planned.

21:05.847 --> 21:09.016
It's when things do not go as planned
that concerns me.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.894
-What then?
-It's when things don't go as planned

21:12.062 --> 21:14.939
that we Jedi are at our best. Trust me.

21:15.399 --> 21:20.027
I reserve my trust for those
who take action, General Skywalker.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.739
Then let me remind you,
we rescued you back there.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.366
And I reserve my trust

21:25.409 --> 21:28.869
for those who understand gratitude,
Captain Tarkin.
