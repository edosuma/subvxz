WEBVTT

01:02.595 --> 01:04.393
Here you go, love.

01:12.205 --> 01:13.570
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

01:27.353 --> 01:29.219
Didn't you ask
for scrambled eggs?

01:30.190 --> 01:31.453
Yeah.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.128
It's all good.

01:36.796 --> 01:39.026
I have a thing
about that. It's just eggs.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.892
Eggs?
No, about people

01:40.967 --> 01:42.435
not doing
their job well.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.395
She got four kids
and an alcoholic husband at home.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.372
She's doing
the best she How do you know that?

01:47.874 --> 01:49.569
She comes through
my line every Sunday,

01:49.642 --> 01:52.043
yelling at her kids
and giving me a stack of coupons.

01:52.912 --> 01:55.438
She can never
find her Costco card,

01:55.515 --> 01:57.881
so I always let her
use mine so she can get a discount.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.309
That's nice of you.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.581
Can I ask you something?
I don't know, can you?

02:04.324 --> 02:06.315
Easy, I know
good grammar.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.626
We're not
in a classroom.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.796
Are you gonna ask me
your question or not?

02:14.167 --> 02:15.635
What took you
so long to respond to me?

02:15.735 --> 02:17.430
I didn't realize
that much time had passed.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.938
I sent you a very well-crafted
message three weeks ago.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.304
I spell-checked it
and everything and got crickets.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.172
Then today,
out of the blue,

02:24.277 --> 02:26.245
you hit me up
asking if I wanna grab dinner.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.271
What changed?

02:29.616 --> 02:31.083
I had a shitty day.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.482
What was so shitty
about it?

02:33.019 --> 02:34.919
The state decided
to execute my client.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.249
I didn't know that
was still legal here.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.193
It's legal in 31 states
and Ohio happens to be one of them.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.463
Was he innocent?
Even if he's not,

02:44.531 --> 02:47.056
the state shouldn't decide
whether he lives or dies.

02:49.002 --> 02:49.992
Sorry.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.168
Me, too.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.507
Normally, I would go home
and have a glass of wine by myself,

02:56.609 --> 02:58.339
but I didn't feel
like being alone.

02:59.312 --> 03:00.541
Not tonight.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.840
You didn't have
any friends or family you can call?

03:03.950 --> 03:04.940
No.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.277
So you turned
to Tinder?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.012
Yeah.

03:10.623 --> 03:11.818
What made you pick me?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.992
I liked your picture.
Really?

03:17.864 --> 03:21.163
You had this sad look
on your face. I felt sorry for you.

03:23.503 --> 03:24.595
Damn.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.069
I didn't mean
for that to sound shady.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.367
Well, it did.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.135
My dad took that
picture of me.

03:35.815 --> 03:38.307
And to be honest,
I don't have many photos of myself.

03:38.851 --> 03:40.376
Why not?
I know what I look like.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.387
Pictures aren't
just about vanity.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.252
They're proof
of your existence.

03:44.357 --> 03:45.847
My family
know I exist.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.259
That's enough.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.301
You gonna eat that?

03:55.768 --> 03:56.997
You can have some.

04:00.907 --> 04:01.897
Mmm.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.440
And they always use
just the right amount of dressing.

04:06.613 --> 04:07.875
Do you really
like this place

04:07.947 --> 04:09.608
or is it the only spot
you could afford?

04:09.716 --> 04:10.910
It's black-owned.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.381
Louche.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.392
You know,
you really shouldn't text and drive.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.428
Ain't nobody texting.
I'm making sure I don't get lost.

04:22.528 --> 04:23.757
I can tell you how
to get to my house.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.230
Give me my ph
Relax. I'm gonna give it back.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.161
So you gonna tell me
where to turn?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.532
Yeah, just...

04:31.604 --> 04:33.698
Oh, so now you gonna
point the directions?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.241
I'm telling you
where to go.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.066
You made a playlist?
That's cute.

04:38.478 --> 04:39.741
Don't go through
my phone.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.041
Did you like
In a Sentimental Mood

04:41.114 --> 04:42.308
before or after
Love Jones?

04:42.415 --> 04:44.543
I knew about that shit
way before Love Jones.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.607
Mmm-mmm. Don't lie.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.149
I mean, okay, I fucked with
it more after I saw the movie.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.281
I appreciate your honesty.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.761
So, what happens
tonight?

05:00.566 --> 05:03.502
You're gonna drop me off
and then you'll go home, I guess.

05:03.936 --> 05:04.926
Oh.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.533
You got something
you wanna say to me?

06:51.611 --> 06:53.477
No, I don't.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.554
Do you know
why I stopped you tonight?

07:01.621 --> 07:03.179
No, sir.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.087
You failed to execute
the turn signal back there.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.689
You were swerving
a little bit, too.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.955
Oh, my bad.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.893
Yeah, it is.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.328
I can't
believe this shit.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.696
Just chill.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.364
I ain't trying
to die tonight.

07:24.243 --> 07:25.540
1104 Dispatch.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.437
What do you got?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.545
Two occupants.
The driver's a black male.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.777
Passenger's
a black female.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.649
They're in a white
Honda Accord. License "trustgod".

07:35.788 --> 07:37.654
Operator failed
to execute a turn signal.

07:37.757 --> 07:40.089
He was driving erratically.
Possible DUI. Over.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.423
Do you need back-

07:43.095 --> 07:44.085
Negative.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.704
I'm gonna ask you
to step out of the vehicle for me.

08:03.616 --> 08:04.947
Can I ask why,
Officer?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.013
No, you may not.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.251
Step out of the car.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.021
Let's go, man.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.954
Back bumper, right there.
Hands on the hood.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.021
I'm gonna
ask you one time,

08:20.132 --> 08:21.464
you got anything
on you that I need to know about?

08:21.534 --> 08:22.558
No, sir.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.001
Any illegal
substances?

08:25.104 --> 08:26.162
No, sir.

08:26.606 --> 08:27.834
What about
in the vehicle?

08:28.241 --> 08:29.299
No, sir.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.181
You been
drinking tonight? No.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.347
Why is that funny?

08:46.158 --> 08:47.387
'Cause I don't drink.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.529
Would you do me a favor
and pop the trunk?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.458
Why?

08:54.534 --> 08:55.796
'Cause I asked you to.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.738
Ain't nothing in there
but shoe boxes.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.236
Let's see 'em.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.079
Right there.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.425
May I help you?

09:26.532 --> 09:27.932
Do you have
a warrant?

09:29.702 --> 09:31.898
Ma'am, he's already agreed
to the search. I don't need a warrant.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.735
What's in the boxes?
Shoes.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.435
You mind
if I take a look?

09:38.911 --> 09:40.106
That's fine.

10:00.633 --> 10:01.964
Could you please
hurry up?

10:05.304 --> 10:06.533
What did you say?

10:08.574 --> 10:09.803
It's just cold.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.811
Put your hands on your head
and get on the ground, now!

10:17.917 --> 10:20.079
Get on the
fucking ground! Are you serious?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.811
Get on the
fucking ground!

10:23.489 --> 10:24.479
Why is he under arrest?

10:24.590 --> 10:26.115
Get back in the car
or you're going to jail, too!

10:26.192 --> 10:28.160
I am an attorney
and I demand to know

10:28.260 --> 10:29.728
why this man
is under arrest.

10:30.262 --> 10:31.889
Sir, sir, sir.
We don't have to do this, sir.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.523
Why is he under arrest?
What is your name?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.396
Get back in the car!
What is your badge number?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.231
I'm not gonna tell you
so get back in the fucking car!

10:37.303 --> 10:39.430
Get back in the car!
We got this. Why is he under arrest?

10:39.505 --> 10:41.599
Sir, we don't have to... Sir...
What is your badge number?

10:41.674 --> 10:44.268
Sir, it was a turn signal.
I ain't done nothing wrong.

10:44.343 --> 10:45.367
I'm reaching
for my cell phone.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.468
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

10:46.545 --> 10:47.604
I have the right to
record this arrest!

10:47.680 --> 10:48.738
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

10:48.814 --> 10:49.941
I'm reaching
for my cell phone!

10:57.623 --> 10:59.489
Give me your fucking hands!
Stop resisting!

10:59.925 --> 11:02.827
Stop! Stay on
the fucking ground!

11:03.529 --> 11:05.293
I need some help! Help!

11:05.498 --> 11:06.965
Stop
fucking resisting!

11:07.033 --> 11:08.022
Stop!

11:12.304 --> 11:13.294
Stop!

11:58.084 --> 11:59.676
Are you okay?

12:00.886 --> 12:01.910
Yeah.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.528
You good?

12:18.437 --> 12:19.529
Huh?

12:19.605 --> 12:20.697
You okay?

12:24.910 --> 12:25.900
Let's go.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.739
We can't just
leave him here.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.246
Yes, we can.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.052
Now, let's go.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.598
Come on!

13:17.496 --> 13:18.987
I gotta call my dad.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.131
What the fuck are you doing?

13:22.768 --> 13:25.135
We can't call anybody.
It'll make them accomplices.

13:25.237 --> 13:26.830
You could've just
said that shit Now we ain't got no phones!

13:26.939 --> 13:28.839
A phone ain't nothing
but a tracking device anyway.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.169
You're bleeding a lot.
It's okay. It only grazed me.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.178
Fuck! Why didn't
you stay in the car?

13:38.284 --> 13:39.444
So this is my fault?

13:40.352 --> 13:41.479
If I didn't get
out of the car,

13:41.587 --> 13:42.952
you would be dead right now.

13:45.624 --> 13:46.682
We gotta get you
to a hospital.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.284
No! We can't.
Just keep driving.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.264
Here. Use this
to stop the bleeding.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.534
Fuck!
What if he's wearing a body cam, huh?

13:57.336 --> 13:58.929
There was
a camera in the car.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.304
This shit about to be
all over the fucking news.

14:02.374 --> 14:03.899
That's why
we have to keep going.

14:04.009 --> 14:04.999
We can't run forever.

14:05.077 --> 14:06.135
/ know that!

14:06.212 --> 14:08.510
But right now we gotta keep running
until we come up with a better plan.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.707
Start throwing
out some ideas.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.545
Since when
am I in charge of coming up with the ideas?

14:11.650 --> 14:13.016
Since you made
the decision to run!

14:13.118 --> 14:14.484
We made that
decision together!

14:14.553 --> 14:16.021
I don't remember that.

14:18.157 --> 14:19.249
Man, fuck this.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.189
Where are you going?

14:28.267 --> 14:30.463
I'm gonna find somebody
with a phone so I can call my family.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.629
If you do that,
then they'll know where we are!

14:32.705 --> 14:33.695
Great.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.433
What if they kill us?
Don't say that!

14:35.541 --> 14:36.838
There's no guarantee
they won't!

14:39.879 --> 14:43.042
You're a black man
that killed a cop and then took his gun.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.343
I'm not a criminal.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.279
You are now.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.355
I just wanna
go home.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.165
And I wanna
see my family.

15:02.801 --> 15:06.738
If you turn yourself in,
you will never see them again.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.275
All we can do
is go forward.

15:12.378 --> 15:14.209
There is nothing
back there for us.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.709
Please.
Let's just keep going.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.044
What about
your family, huh?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.610
You don't care about
leaving them behind?

15:25.357 --> 15:27.291
No. I don't.

15:33.799 --> 15:34.789
We can't just
keep driving.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.868
We need to figure out
what the fuck we gonna do, you know?

15:37.403 --> 15:39.394
All right.
All right, all right.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.373
Let's go to
my uncle's house.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.543
We can stay there for a few days
and we can figure out our next move.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.374
Where's your
uncle live?

15:47.446 --> 15:48.572
New Orleans.

15:48.647 --> 15:49.637
That's hours from here.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.773
Then we should
get going.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.103
Could you please
turn that shit down?

16:56.882 --> 16:58.282
It's the only thing
that calms me.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.045
Well, I can't hear
myself think.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.347
I don't care.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.492
Don't touch my shit.
Pull over!

17:11.563 --> 17:13.054
Why?
So I can get out.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.564
You ain't going nowhere.

17:16.234 --> 17:17.566
We in this together.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.080
Why are you
slowing down?

17:34.186 --> 17:35.244
I'm out of gas.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.147
Why didn't you
say something?

17:38.223 --> 17:39.384
What do you mean
why I didn't say something?

17:39.491 --> 17:41.016
I had other shit
on my mind.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.992
Now we gotta flag
this car down.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.057
I hope they're black.

17:50.169 --> 17:51.659
That ain't
always a good thing.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.382
Y'all having
car trouble?

18:13.459 --> 18:14.619
Uh...

18:15.294 --> 18:17.126
Yeah, we...
We ran out of gas.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.625
Ma'am, are you
all right?

18:21.700 --> 18:24.260
Yeah. I just...
I accidentally cut myself.

18:25.070 --> 18:28.131
Tell you what.
Why don't y'all hop in my truck?

18:28.240 --> 18:29.730
I've got a first aid
in the backseat.

18:29.808 --> 18:31.777
There's a gas station
up the road. I'll give you a ride.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.072
We don't mind walking.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.640
Come on, now.
I don't bite.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.949
I'll give you a ride.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.690
- You sure you're all right there?
- I'm good.

19:10.849 --> 19:11.941
Oh, fuck.

19:12.951 --> 19:14.078
What?
What?

19:14.520 --> 19:17.148
Is
something wron

19:18.824 --> 19:20.451
I just didn't know
you were a sheriff.

19:20.526 --> 19:23.222
Hmm.
Oh, yeah. I'm off duty today.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.094
You know what?

19:27.533 --> 19:30.661
I think we can walk
the rest of the way. What the hell.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.264
No. This will be
my good deed for the day.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.432
Uh-huh.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.210
Y'all okay? You know,
you seem jumpy.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.871
No, we're fine.

19:42.981 --> 19:46.645
We just, uh... We took a wrong
turn somewhere and got lost.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.043
Uh-huh.

19:49.154 --> 19:50.144
Where are we?

19:51.156 --> 19:53.056
Well, this here
is Kentucky, my friends.

19:53.592 --> 19:54.616
Don't you worry.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.889
We'll get you some gas
and you'll be on your way.

19:56.995 --> 20:00.363
Uh, Thank you.
Ma'am, how's your leg uch better.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.337
- Gas costs money.
- Oh, shit! Oh!

20:10.075 --> 20:12.373
- I left my stuff back in the car.
- Me, too.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.343
All right. I gotcha.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.308
Thank you
Thanks so much.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.816
Yeah. I'll be right back.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.726
Yes, sir, they have the car
stopped at Tenth and Grove.

20:33.432 --> 20:34.729
Howdy.
Y'all got gas cans?

20:34.833 --> 20:36.699
Oh, yeah, first aisle.
You can't miss it.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.334
I'd like
to fill this up.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.402
It's gonna
be 10 bucks.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.606
All right.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.706
1-8-7-10-29, Frank.

20:51.783 --> 20:54.946
Officer shot and killed
in Ohio by two assailants.

20:55.053 --> 20:58.512
Suspects are one
young black male, one young black female.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.782
One B/F
was wounded by officer.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.521
Suspects are said to be
armed and dangerous.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.030
Last seen operating white
Honda Accord.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.292
Stop pacing.
I can't help it.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.200
You look guilty.
I am guilty.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.738
Have you been
charged with something?

21:14.139 --> 21:15.800
No.
Then you're not guilty.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.646
Why is he staring
at us like that?

21:29.755 --> 21:31.052
I don't know.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.217
Do you need
anything else?

21:36.228 --> 21:37.218
Is that it?

21:39.398 --> 21:40.490
Um...

21:41.500 --> 21:43.229
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.826
That's it.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.408
Get in the driver's seat.
Are you crazy?

21:57.482 --> 21:58.575
I think he knows.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.950
Oh, fuck.
Y'all gonna leave without me?

22:10.529 --> 22:11.792
Whoa.

22:11.863 --> 22:13.160
Get in the car.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.126
Take it easy.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.034
What the fuck?

22:18.704 --> 22:19.693
Take it easy.

22:20.672 --> 22:21.764
Get in.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.375
All right.
All right.

22:27.212 --> 22:28.270
I'm getting in.

22:35.053 --> 22:36.111
My name's Edg

22:36.822 --> 22:38.517
I've lived in Kentucky
all my life.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.891
My wife died
three years ago

22:40.992 --> 22:43.018
and I've been raising
my son all by myself.

22:45.063 --> 22:46.554
I'm all he's got
in this world.

22:47.733 --> 22:50.224
And watching him grow up
has been the greatest blessing of my life.

22:54.005 --> 22:55.837
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill you.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.033
Was it true?
Did y'all kill that police officer?

22:59.144 --> 23:00.304
It was self-defense.

23:01.246 --> 23:02.577
Well,
I'm sure it was.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.542
I've got some colleagues
that have crossed the line more than once.

23:10.188 --> 23:11.849
- Pop the trunk.
- Why?

23:11.923 --> 23:12.913
Just do it.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.762
Get in. Please.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.273
Look,
I don't know what happened.

23:38.550 --> 23:39.676
But whatever it was,

23:40.218 --> 23:43.654
I'm sure you had
good reason for doing what you did.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.882
But please.
Let me help you.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.260
What'dyoudothat for?
He wanted to help us.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.892
He isn't gonna help us.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.573
/f is their job to make
you feel like everything will be okay.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.200
But the second you confess,
you become property of the state.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.539
Is that what you want?

24:06.411 --> 24:07.936
You wanna be
the state's property?

24:10.615 --> 24:11.639
No.

24:37.809 --> 24:38.833
Slow down.

24:39.778 --> 24:40.870
I got it.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.209
I'm just trying
to keep us from getting pulled over again.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.510
I'm hungry.

24:46.685 --> 24:49.950
Me, too.
Let's stop at McDonald's or something.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.114
That's disgusting.

24:51.923 --> 24:53.448
Now ain't the time
to be choosy.

25:05.971 --> 25:08.872
Ah, shit.
We ain't got no money.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.335
Check the glove box.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.710
Anything?
No.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.446
Look at God.

25:24.155 --> 25:25.384
Oh.

25:26.224 --> 25:27.316
Oh, man.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.698
Hey!
What you doing?

25:33.798 --> 25:35.232
Chill. I got this.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.841
Hey. You wanna
make some money and get some free food?

25:49.014 --> 25:50.038
What's the catch?

25:50.515 --> 25:51.846
There ain't no catch,
little man.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.849
All right.
What y'all want?

25:55.921 --> 25:57.684
All right. Let me get
a double cheeseburger

25:57.756 --> 26:00.885
with a ten-piece
chicken nuggets and sweet and sour sauce.

26:01.526 --> 26:03.187
And I'll have
a chicken sandwich

26:03.261 --> 26:05.753
with no condiments
and a small fry.

26:05.864 --> 26:07.195
You can keep the change.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.527
Ain't gonna be
that much left after all that.

26:22.113 --> 26:23.911
You make a lot of noise
when you eat.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.542
Woman, this could be
my last meal. Would you just let me

26:30.055 --> 26:32.455
It's just hard for me
to eat with you making that much noise.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.992
I've never heard
of someone not being able to eat

26:43.802 --> 26:46.794
because they're disgusted
by the sound of other people eating.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.768
I know it's weird,
but I have a thing about it.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.237
How do you
avoid the sounds of people eating?

26:53.645 --> 26:55.078
I eat alone
most of the time.

26:56.247 --> 26:57.545
That's not surprising.

27:03.588 --> 27:04.646
You scared?

27:05.423 --> 27:06.618
You're lying.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.024
How do you know?
You answered too fast.

27:13.999 --> 27:17.264
I thought if a person answered quickly,
that meant they were telling the truth.

27:17.602 --> 27:19.662
My dad always told me
if the person answered too quickly,

27:19.771 --> 27:21.068
they had a lie ready to go.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.002
Well, that's good
to know.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.836
How do you know
if your clients are telling the truth?

27:29.447 --> 27:32.076
Then how can you
defend them? I don't.

27:32.784 --> 27:33.774
That's my job.

27:34.953 --> 27:36.421
Are you
a good lawyer?

27:37.489 --> 27:39.320
I'm an
excellent lawyer.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.452
Why do black people
always feel the need to be excellent?

27:43.628 --> 27:45.289
Why can't we just
be ourselves?

27:54.272 --> 27:55.262
We should go.

28:08.887 --> 28:09.877
Is this y'all?

28:16.561 --> 28:17.961
Nah, man.
That ain't us.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.998
Wait! My daddy wanna
talk to /all! Wait, where you going?

28:26.371 --> 28:28.362
Oh, fuck!
Daddy!

28:28.473 --> 28:29.804
God damn!
Daddy!

28:29.874 --> 28:31.968
Oh, shit ball!

28:32.544 --> 28:34.034
Oh, dang!

28:34.145 --> 28:35.841
God! Just watch
where you're going, dawg!

28:35.914 --> 28:36.972
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you coming.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.209
You almost killed my daddy!

28:38.616 --> 28:40.016
God, I think you
got my bad knee!

28:40.085 --> 28:41.746
Can you move it?
You broke my daddy's

28:41.853 --> 28:44.220
Stop crying like a little bitch!
I'm gonna be all right.

28:44.322 --> 28:46.154
Mama told you to stop
calling me a little bitch.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.749
Nigga, I'll call you
what the fuck I want!

28:47.859 --> 28:51.056
We have to
now. You gotta take him to the hospital.

28:51.129 --> 28:52.563
We can't go
to a hospital.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.690
So I can get y'all food, but you
can't take my daddy to the hospital?

28:56.367 --> 28:58.427
Where's the nearest hospital?
We don't have time for that.

28:58.536 --> 29:00.664
You should calm down
Don't talk to me like that.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.206
I'll talk to you
however I wanna talk to you.

29:02.273 --> 29:03.707
Y'all sound like
me and my bitch!

29:03.775 --> 29:05.072
Don't call
my mama a bitch!

29:05.176 --> 29:07.202
Nigga, I wasn't talking
about your mama.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.905
Come on,
we're gonna take you to a hospital.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.646
I got plenty of hoes.
Your mama ain't the only one, too.

29:14.385 --> 29:15.444
Shit!

29:16.788 --> 29:19.723
Move your fat ass.
Come on. Fuck!

29:20.325 --> 29:22.293
Y'all just
gonna sit there? All right. No problem.

29:23.128 --> 29:24.220
No, you enjoy this.

29:32.637 --> 29:33.798
Oh, God damn.

29:37.809 --> 29:38.935
Damn, my knee!

29:46.618 --> 29:48.552
We need to take out
all these motherfuckers.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.081
That's not
what we're doing. I seen the tape, okay?

29:51.456 --> 29:53.788
Shit. If a cop
shot at my bitch,

29:53.892 --> 29:55.052
I'd have killed his ass too.

29:56.261 --> 29:59.458
Cop killers!
Cop killers! Shut the fuck up, man.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.958
Are y'all the new
Black Panthers? Is that what this is?

30:04.068 --> 30:05.036
No.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.666
- Oh, this is revenge.
- For what?

30:07.772 --> 30:10.935
For that nigga
he killed two years ago. What?

30:11.009 --> 30:14.638
Some dude was taking his daughter
to school, minding his own business,

30:15.180 --> 30:16.647
and that cop killed him
for no reason.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.507
Did you know about this?
Of course not.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.808
Hey.

30:22.353 --> 30:24.185
Hey, hey, the hospital
on the left.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.517
Pull over. Pull over.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.027
All right, we're here.

30:42.173 --> 30:45.939
Y'all wanna help me
with him or not? No. No, no, no.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.309
There's probably cameras
all up into this bitch.

30:55.086 --> 30:56.918
- Come on, boy.
- I'm sorry, man.

31:03.061 --> 31:04.187
Power to the people.

31:08.266 --> 31:09.290
Come on, Dad.

31:11.636 --> 31:12.796
I got you.
I got you.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.913
So, how many
views did it have?

31:33.157 --> 31:34.853
A hundred thousand.
Fuck.

31:37.028 --> 31:39.326
How long
before helicopters start flying over us?

31:39.397 --> 31:40.421
I don't know.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.228
Please tell me you
didn't fuck with that cop on purpose.

31:43.334 --> 31:44.597
Of course not.

31:44.702 --> 31:46.363
I don't
know you like that. You could be crazy.

31:46.437 --> 31:48.702
It should be a sin
to call a black woman crazy.

31:48.773 --> 31:50.867
Oh, are you one of those people
that think God is a black woman?

31:50.942 --> 31:52.307
I don't
believe in God.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.935
Lord help me.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.778
You're on
E again.

31:57.115 --> 31:59.606
Fuck! I really need you
to start paying attention to that shit!

31:59.717 --> 32:01.515
Why don't you
pay attention? You're driving!

32:10.361 --> 32:12.387
I don't think it's
smart to be walking into gas stations.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.097
It's not that scary.
I already told you what to do.

32:16.167 --> 32:17.532
Only 'cause you
don't have to do it.

32:18.870 --> 32:21.396
You got this.
I believe in you.

32:22.307 --> 32:23.535
Don't patronize me.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.304
I'm not.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.076
There's one.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.408
Now the breaking news out of Ohio.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.603
Just be cool!

33:00.678 --> 33:02.442
...on the lookout
for two suspects.

33:02.513 --> 33:04.413
An African-American man
and woman,

33:04.482 --> 33:06.780
who they say
has shot and killed a police officer

33:06.851 --> 33:08.580
during a roadside
altercation.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.315
Dashcam footage
of the shooting was released late...

33:15.226 --> 33:17.786
Fuck! Fuck!

33:28.006 --> 33:30.270
Let me get 40
on pump nine.

33:37.982 --> 33:39.450
Is that a Glock?

33:40.051 --> 33:41.109
Yeah.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.185
Can I hold it?

33:46.057 --> 33:47.115
No, you can't.

33:47.992 --> 33:49.824
I'll pay for your gas
if you let me hold it.

33:50.395 --> 33:51.987
That's not a fair trade.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.521
If you don't let me
hold it, man,

33:54.632 --> 33:56.066
you're gonna have to
stick up another gas station.

33:56.901 --> 33:58.301
Man, I can kill you
right now.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.136
You don't look like
a killer to me.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.893
What's it about
holding a deadly weapon

34:26.998 --> 34:28.693
that just makes me
feel so alive?

34:39.811 --> 34:41.039
What the fuck
are you doing?

34:53.791 --> 34:54.849
What you doing?

35:06.404 --> 35:07.837
I'm just messing
with you, man.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.963
Damn, why are you
knocking like the police?

36:44.168 --> 36:46.762
If you didn't throw
our phones out, we could've called.

36:47.238 --> 36:48.296
If I didn't throw
our phones out,

36:48.372 --> 36:50.204
the police would've
caught us by now.

36:51.642 --> 36:52.666
Louche.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.050
Can I help you?
My uncle here?

37:04.155 --> 37:06.521
Who's your uncle?
Bitch, don't play with me.

37:08.025 --> 37:09.015
He in the back.

37:27.878 --> 37:30.177
Well, if it isn't
the black Bonnie and Clyde.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.108
I don't know what
the news is saying,

37:34.218 --> 37:35.845
but whatever it is,
it's not true.

37:45.296 --> 37:46.855
Y'all hungry?

38:06.484 --> 38:09.578
I always hoped you'd escape this
life without getting shot at.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.883
Who patched you up?

38:14.759 --> 38:16.090
You ain't do
a good job.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.990
What's your plan?
We need to figure that out.

38:22.566 --> 38:24.592
Y'all need to hurry up
and figure it out quick.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.398
The police, they like
slave-catchers.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.234
They can smell
a runaway for miles.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.330
I'm aware.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.668
How you gonna outrun the police?
We don't have to outrun them.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.404
We just have to make sure
they don't know where we are.

38:34.779 --> 38:36.838
That ain't hard to do.
Cops are dumb as shit.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.074
Not all of them.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.675
She only say that 'cause
she used to fuck one of them motherfuckers.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.515
Don't be jealous.
I ain't jealous of nobody.

38:43.621 --> 38:44.815
Nigga's jealous of me.

38:44.922 --> 38:46.652
We might need to stay here
for a little while.

38:46.757 --> 38:47.850
Ooh, hell, no.

38:48.526 --> 38:50.084
The SWAT team
probably already on their way.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.755
I don't need those muscle-necked
motherfuckers sniffing around my shit.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.322
What are we
pposed to do?

38:55.433 --> 38:56.764
So you're just gonna
let us get killed?

38:56.834 --> 38:59.166
That's the risk you take.
Fuck you, Earl!

39:04.475 --> 39:05.670
How long you need to stay?

39:06.510 --> 39:07.671
A night or two.

39:08.379 --> 39:09.539
Well, which one is it?

39:10.314 --> 39:11.304
Two nights.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.340
Fine.

39:15.453 --> 39:16.886
We need some cash.
How much?

39:17.655 --> 39:20.056
Enough to last us
for a few days? What else?

39:21.692 --> 39:24.457
We need one
of your cars. You can kiss my black

39:24.528 --> 39:26.656
He love them cars
more than he love us.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.562
I ain't got no extra cars
just laying around.

39:28.999 --> 39:31.400
What about the
blue Catalina? Goddess, shut the fuck up.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.510
Do you agree
to my terms or not?

39:48.886 --> 39:50.285
I ain't giving you
no damn car.

39:51.355 --> 39:52.914
You owe me!

40:06.871 --> 40:07.895
Okay.

40:08.272 --> 40:09.535
Go get my car keys.

40:10.541 --> 40:11.565
Sit down.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.600
Y'all need to figure out
what the hell you're gonna do

40:14.044 --> 40:15.706
once you leave here.
We will.

40:16.614 --> 40:17.774
Young Blood?
Mmm-hmm.

40:17.882 --> 40:19.008
She speak for
both of you?

40:19.583 --> 40:20.573
No.

40:20.684 --> 40:22.585
- Could've fooled me.
- Don't do that.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.121
Well, I'm just trying
to understand this nigga's mind.

40:25.556 --> 40:27.456
If you ask me,
he seems a little...

40:29.193 --> 40:30.353
A little slow.

40:30.728 --> 40:31.718
I think we should
go to Cuba.

40:31.796 --> 40:33.525
That's what I'm talking about.

40:34.064 --> 40:36.533
Isn't that where, uh...

40:37.101 --> 40:39.433
Assata Shakur went
after she killed that state trooper?

40:39.537 --> 40:40.595
Allegedly killed.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.469
We just gotta keep driving
until we get to Miami and, and then...

40:43.574 --> 40:45.599
We'll be standing
in front of a large body of water.

40:45.876 --> 40:47.708
How're we supposed
to cross that? I don't know yet.

40:48.412 --> 40:49.573
Of course you don't.

40:50.247 --> 40:51.442
You got a better idea?

40:56.654 --> 40:58.645
Where the hell you
think you're going?

40:59.957 --> 41:01.447
I'm exhausted.

41:01.792 --> 41:03.886
Y'all ain't going nowhere
till you shave your heads.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.292
We're not doing that.

41:05.362 --> 41:07.331
You wanna keep walking
around looking how you do in that tape?

41:07.431 --> 41:09.832
You're not shaving
my head.

41:12.837 --> 41:15.499
Fine. You can choose.
You're a woman.

41:17.608 --> 41:19.269
I believe in a woman's
right to choose.

41:21.745 --> 41:22.906
But you ain't shit.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.672
Use the cheap razor
on his ass.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.309
Man, this is fucked

41:56.881 --> 41:58.872
That's what happens
when you on the run from the law.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.312
I didn't know Earl
had a niece.

42:30.347 --> 42:32.043
We're not close.

42:32.483 --> 42:34.474
Who's he related to?
Your mother or your father?

42:34.552 --> 42:35.814
My mother.

42:36.186 --> 42:37.210
Mmm.

42:37.321 --> 42:39.050
She and I weren't
close either.

42:39.523 --> 42:41.218
Damn, who are
you close to?

42:41.325 --> 42:43.191
Are you close
to your family?

42:43.928 --> 42:47.557
Yeah. They don't care
how I make my money as long as I'm happy.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.064
Are you?
Sometimes.

42:51.368 --> 42:52.529
What makes you happy?

42:53.070 --> 42:55.266
Um... Robes at
fancy hotels.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.737
A good lace front.

42:58.776 --> 43:00.835
And when your uncle
kisses me on the forehead.

43:04.949 --> 43:05.938
Hmm.

43:06.850 --> 43:07.943
What?

43:08.452 --> 43:09.544
Nothing.

43:10.254 --> 43:13.121
I'm just surprised
by the amount of love he has in his life.

43:13.857 --> 43:15.325
Well, he don't
always deserve it.

43:16.193 --> 43:17.661
He needs us
to worship him.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.896
Out there,
he ain't shit.

43:21.031 --> 43:23.398
But in here,
he a king.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.260
Hmm.

45:31.995 --> 45:33.019
You like it?

45:34.031 --> 45:35.089
I don't know yet.

45:39.670 --> 45:40.728
You like this shit.

45:41.538 --> 45:42.596
Shut up.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.015
I'm sitting here
trying to mind my business...

47:05.122 --> 47:09.150
It can't stop till
I get my ring back. Oh, hell no, nigga!

47:09.259 --> 47:11.990
I'm sick and tired of you
putting your motherfucking hands on me!

47:12.129 --> 47:13.494
I deal with way too much
to be dealing with your...

47:13.597 --> 47:17.124
- Here you go.
- Give me my fucking ring

47:17.201 --> 47:18.828
- You know what?
- You want me totalkto him?

47:18.936 --> 47:22.497
Give me my goddamn respect!
I want my motherfucking respect!

47:22.606 --> 47:23.630
We're not gonna
go there, Earl!

47:23.707 --> 47:24.697
I will choke you
out of this place.

47:24.808 --> 47:26.708
You already know!
Please don't.

47:28.212 --> 47:29.702
He didn't used
to be like this.

47:33.450 --> 47:35.043
Iraq fucked him up.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.715
I don't wanna
deal with this shit.

47:41.825 --> 47:43.156
Let's leave first thing
tomorrow.

47:47.531 --> 47:48.964
You okay?

47:50.634 --> 47:51.863
How is that possible?

47:52.502 --> 47:54.232
You took somebody's life
yesterday.

47:55.372 --> 47:56.396
I guess...

47:59.810 --> 48:01.903
I'm just used to saying
I'm okay even when I'm not.

48:02.646 --> 48:03.772
I know the feeling.

48:06.316 --> 48:09.183
What if God wanted me to die
and I messed up His plan?

48:10.420 --> 48:12.548
I don't think that's
what He wanted. How do you know?

48:12.656 --> 48:13.680
I just...

48:14.992 --> 48:16.823
I just think you were
meant to be here.

48:23.333 --> 48:24.892
I'm making an
executive decision.

48:26.236 --> 48:28.796
We're going to Cuba.
Executive decision?

48:28.906 --> 48:30.840
We can't leave here tomorrow
and not know where we're going.

48:30.908 --> 48:33.206
We' What about that large body of water?
re it out.

48:42.486 --> 48:43.783
I'm scared.

48:45.455 --> 48:46.582
It's all right.

48:48.892 --> 48:50.826
I'll be brave enough
for the both of us.

48:59.770 --> 49:00.760
Hey, uh...

49:01.772 --> 49:03.103
Why does your uncle
owe you?

49:06.910 --> 49:09.038
For what?
I got him out of prison once.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.813
He killed somebody.
Damn, who'd he kill?

49:15.252 --> 49:16.310
My mother.

49:57.094 --> 49:58.823
I'm rubbing your head
for good luck.

50:01.431 --> 50:02.592
I don't believe in luck.

50:04.468 --> 50:05.833
I think everyth
is destined.

50:39.469 --> 50:40.527
Who the fuck called you?

50:42.205 --> 50:44.333
I'm just here to make sure
everybody's okay.

50:44.408 --> 50:45.841
You still fucking
this nigga? No.

50:45.909 --> 50:47.309
Why the fuck he here?
I ain't call him.

50:47.377 --> 50:48.367
Why the fuck you here?

50:49.312 --> 50:51.213
A neighbor
heard some commotion and got concerned.

50:51.314 --> 50:52.441
Oh, shit,
it's the cops.

50:52.549 --> 50:54.142
Get down! Get down.

50:55.952 --> 50:57.648
Don't worry.

50:59.022 --> 51:00.752
I take real good care
of my property.

51:02.092 --> 51:03.582
Do you?
Oh, yeah.

51:04.961 --> 51:06.361
She my biggest draw.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.225
You got a new truck?

51:14.738 --> 51:16.103
I don't know who
the fuck truck that is.

51:17.274 --> 51:19.868
You mind if I come in?
Not without a warrant, nigga.

51:20.677 --> 51:22.407
You go get your paperwork
together.

51:23.013 --> 51:24.276
I'll give you
the grand tour.

51:27.784 --> 51:29.411
I think I will come back
with that warrant.

51:29.519 --> 51:32.011
Make sure you use
the large font.

51:33.690 --> 51:35.090
I can't see shit.

51:36.059 --> 51:37.891
Keep your hands
to yourself, Earl.

51:37.961 --> 51:39.929
I didn't want you to
come here in the first motherfucking place!

51:41.898 --> 51:43.423
Close the gate, nigga!

51:49.406 --> 51:51.067
You know I'm gonna
have to kill that nigga one day, yeah?

51:57.747 --> 51:59.272
Y'all need to get
the fuck out of here.

52:00.250 --> 52:01.411
Shit.

52:04.321 --> 52:05.550
There's clothes
in the closet!

53:28.972 --> 53:30.064
Take this.

53:32.909 --> 53:34.843
That should cover your gas
for most of the way.

53:36.079 --> 53:38.013
And the man at that address
will take care of you.

53:38.081 --> 53:39.640
His wife ain't shit,
but he cool.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.076
Johnny Shepherd?
Who is he?

53:44.421 --> 53:45.650
We served together.

53:47.424 --> 53:50.416
I saved his life once.
He'll be expecting you.

53:51.194 --> 53:54.186
And he got a friend that got a plane
to get you over that body of water.

54:16.453 --> 54:17.750
Thank you, Uncle Earl.

54:19.589 --> 54:20.886
Nigga,
I ain't your uncle.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.452
Take care
of yourself. You, too.

54:34.971 --> 54:36.029
Take care of her.

54:38.375 --> 54:39.433
I love you,
baby girl.

54:39.943 --> 54:40.967
Love you, too.

55:22.852 --> 55:24.320
Hey, it's beautiful
out here.

55:39.135 --> 55:40.193
Is it?

55:43.440 --> 55:46.500
I'm just trying to make
conversation. I'm just being honest.

55:46.609 --> 55:48.134
Do you have to be
honest all the time?

55:49.813 --> 55:51.713
Do you want me
to be silent? I didn't say that.

56:16.740 --> 56:17.764
What you doing?

56:21.578 --> 56:23.171
I'm gonna try
and get some

57:02.886 --> 57:05.548
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

57:05.622 --> 57:07.886
I heard a band playing.
I wanted to see where it was coming from.

57:07.957 --> 57:10.552
We need to keep going.
I know, but I'm exhausted.

57:11.194 --> 57:13.390
And you knocked out
in the back while I'm trying to stay awake.

57:13.463 --> 57:14.521
Fine, I'll drive.

57:14.597 --> 57:16.190
When was the last time
you heard some live music?

57:16.266 --> 57:17.358
I don't know.

57:18.101 --> 57:20.467
I mean, we only
a few hours from Georgia. So we got time.

57:25.975 --> 57:27.568
Would you have gone
on a second date with me?

57:27.644 --> 57:29.043
No.
Damn.

57:29.112 --> 57:31.911
It's not personal.
I just like being alone.

57:31.981 --> 57:33.040
I get it.

57:38.154 --> 57:39.713
What would
the second date have been?

57:43.960 --> 57:46.759
I'm not telling you.
Come on. Don't do me like that.

57:46.830 --> 57:48.127
Aw, you should
have said yes.

57:48.965 --> 57:51.491
Okay, fine. I'll go.
It's too late now.

57:52.101 --> 57:53.660
I have the right
to change my mind.

57:55.238 --> 57:57.263
Okay. I'm officially
saying yes to the second date.

57:57.340 --> 57:58.432
Now what are we doing?

58:04.314 --> 58:05.804
I'm taking you dancing.
Let's go.

58:05.915 --> 58:07.906
Can we dance
when we get to where we're go

58:07.984 --> 58:10.078
Just to be safe?
I'm tired of playing it safe.

58:10.153 --> 58:12.451
You're willing to risk
getting caught so we can dance?

58:12.522 --> 58:13.614
Hell, yeah.

58:18.094 --> 58:19.824
One dance
and we can leave. I promise.

58:23.967 --> 58:25.491
I'll buy you
a drink.

58:30.540 --> 58:32.201
Yeah. Come on.

58:35.778 --> 58:36.939
You good?

58:38.348 --> 58:40.509
Let's go.
We gotta get a move on.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.720
Why you so jumpy?
I'm nervous.

59:26.095 --> 59:27.722
Ain't nobody out here
thinking about us.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.240
Watch your hands.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.290
Don't you owe me
a drink?

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:12.165
What do you want?
Bourbon. The expensive kind.

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.013
Hey, handsome.

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:35.317
What can I get you?

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:36.681
A bourbon.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:50.070
- Oh, I don't drink.
- Maybe you should start.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.635
Oh, these are
on the house.

01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:59.238
Thank you.

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.577
Don't worry.
You're safe here.

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:15.555
Oh!

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:28.276
The bartender
recognized me. Oh, shit. We gotta go.

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:34.247
I think we're good.
I don't know.

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:38.777
Trust me.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:03.430
What do you want?

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.433
/ want a guy
to show me myself.

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.314
/ want him to
love me so deeply,

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.784
I'm not afraid to
show him how ugly I can be.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:24.023
/ want him to show me scars
I never knew I had.

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:29.522
But I don't want him
to make them go away.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.199
/ want him to hold my hand
while I nurse them myself.

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:38.730
And I want him to cherish
the bruises they leave behind.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:53.647
We should go.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.202
What do you want?

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:08.799
I wanna ride or die.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.373
Oh, my God.
What does that even mean?

01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:13.707
I just want someone
that's always gonna love me.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.870
No matter what.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:22.013
Someone that's gonna
hold my hand and never let it go.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.081
But she gotta be
special though.

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:34.058
'Cause she gonna
be my legacy. What do you mean?

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:36.925
Look, I ain't gonna
bend the world.

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:41.270
As long as my lady
remembers me fondly,

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:43.566
that's all I need.

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:09.794
Skinny Luther
or fat Luther?

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.158
Mmm, Skinny Luther.

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.267
Oh, fuck.
What?

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.439
See, I don't trust people
that like skinny Luther.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.767
Skinny Luther was dope.

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:24.409
He had a lot more energy,
he sang better and his clothes fit.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.177
You crazy as hell.
Fat Luther was the shit.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.077
Who else you know
that can pull off a Jheri curl

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:31.017
with a three-piece suit
at the same damn time?

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:33.751
Nobody.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:52.304
What you doing?
I thought you said no more stopping.

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.199
I changed my mind.

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.376
What do you mean,
you changed your mind? We gotta go.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.038
Relax.

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.364
It's gonna get scared
and kick you in the face.

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:25.907
They're not wild.

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.236
Well, how you know?

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.904
My uncle used to take me
horseback riding when I was a kid.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:32.806
Really?

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:37.580
He told me nothing scares a white man
more than seeing a black man on a horse.

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:40.146
Why?

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:42.486
Because they have
to look up at him.

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.396
I've never been
on a horse.

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:50.223
You should try it sometime.

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:51.823
Maybe I should
do it right now.

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.670
You should try when
we have more time.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.102
I'll take you.
When?

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.606
I don't know.
What if we don't make it?

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.575
We will.
You don't know that.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.380
I'm getting
on the horse.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:19.417
Come on.

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.897
Ready?
Yeah. Climb up on this side.

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:27.595
Yeah?
Yeah. Got it?

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:35.633
This way.

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:52.558
It's nice,
isn't it?

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.995
Yeah.

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:00.758
Hey!

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.069
- Oh, shit.
- What are you doing?

01:09:03.738 --> 01:09:06.072
Get the fuck
off my property! Let's go. Let's go.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:17.649
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:07.792
Oh, fuck.

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:37.231
Oh, fuck.

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:39.857
Fuck.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.740
I think I saw a body shop
somewhere back there.

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:48.003
Hell, that was
a while ago.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.738
Well, we need to get
the car fixed.

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:52.746
All right,
get in the car. I'll push.

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:12.623
Fuck!

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.657
Your radiator is fucked.

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.119
Your water pump, too.

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.559
That don't sound good.

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.994
I can probably get it
back to you tomorrow for about two grand.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:45.931
Two gran
need it back today.

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:47.391
Y'all in a rush?

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:50.302
Yeah, we're... We're on
our way to visit family.

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:52.169
Now, why y'all wanna
rush to do that?

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.013
But I can probably get it
back for you tonight.

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.310
But it's gonna cost you
a little more.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:03.681
How much more?
Another $500.

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.114
Come here.

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.282
That's all
of our money.

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.826
What's the alternative?

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:15.423
I ain't got all day.
We gonna do this or what?

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:32.376
Here. It's all we have.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.010
We need the car fixed
as soon as possible.

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.114
Work as fast as I can.

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:42.823
Can I use
your bathroom?

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:45.190
Yeah, it's right in
through there.

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:43.085
Hello?
Dad?

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.356
Are you okay, boy?

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.721
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.191
This ain't like you.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:13:59.864
I know.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:09.538
I just wanted
to let you know that I'm okay.

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.079
And that I love you.

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.384
/ love you too, son.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.923
We're trying to get to...

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.274
Now, why would
you do that?

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:41.742
Get out of my house.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.744
You're under arrest
for helping a fugitive.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.473
You do what
you gotta do.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:46.942
Oh, we're going
to find him.

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.847
Yeah, but not
with my help.

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:09.471
What you about
to do now?

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.365
Y'all are worki
on my nerves.

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:13.874
Why don't you go
take a walk or something?

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.769
We're not leaving
you with this car.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.707
Don't nobody wanna
steal your car.

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:18.973
Well, I just wanna
make sure.

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.380
You got bigger
problems than me.

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:22.807
You know who we are?

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.716
I'm old, boy, not blind.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.150
Then why didn't you
give us a discount?

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.217
'Cause unlike the rest
of these simple-ass niggas,

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.620
I don't approve
of what y'all did.

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.182
We didn't have a choice.

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:32.624
That don't matter.

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.725
You gave them
a license to kill us.

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:36.797
Shot at me.
You gave him an excuse.

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.731
You weren't there.
No, I wasn't.

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:41.794
But if I was, I'd have
took my ticket and been on my way.

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.667
Can you work more
and talk less?

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:46.139
I could work a lot faster
if you left me the fuck alone.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.870
I'm not leaving you
with this car.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:53.247
Damn. This is bullshit.

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.583
What about if
I gave you some insurance?

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.689
I don't want no house keys
or no driver's license

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.556
'cause all of that
can be replaced.

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:10.054
Son?

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:16.727
Yes, sir?

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:19.506
How'd you like to take
these nice folks on a walk?

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:23.535
Yeah.

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:26.771
Yes, sir.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.108
You keep them occupied
till I finish this car.

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:30.276
And stay off the street.

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:33.078
I'm...
I know who you are.

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.179
What's your name?

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:37.617
Everybody
call me Junior.

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:42.730
It's an honor
to meet y'all.

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.431
I'm going to
a protest tomorrow.

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:53.597
For what?

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.366
To support you.

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.643
I can't believe
y'all are here,

01:16:58.714 --> 01:17:01.706
I was just watching
y'all, like, on TV.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.275
And then,
now you're walking right next to me.

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:05.751
That shit is crazy.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.489
I really hope
y'all make it.

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.319
Yeah, me too.

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:18.165
Just know,
even if you don't, it'll be okay.

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.135
How so?

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:27.599
'Cause then
you'll be immortal.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.137
I like that.

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:34.238
I'd rather live.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.643
I wanna
be immortal, too.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.185
You're too young
to be worried about all that

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.256
No, I'm not.

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:48.123
- / could die today.
- Don't say that.

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:50.966
/ just want people
to know I was here.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:55.136
As long
as your family knows you were here,

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:57.428
that's all that matters.

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:31.996
Yo, Junior?

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.538
Could you
take our pictu

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:37.401
Yeah.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.970
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.542
Come on.

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:43.574
I want proof
we were here.

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:58.523
Right here.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.446
Yo.

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:57.916
Yo!

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.323
Do you mind
if we make a detour?

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:01.794
I do, actually.

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:07.895
You okay?

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:11.133
Not really.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.763
We were close
when I was younger.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.462
But as I got older,
I felt like

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.431
I didn't know her
anymore.

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.701
She didn't know me either.

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.509
We could go months
without talking.

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.449
And when we did,

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.952
I hated it.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.490
I had nothing
to say to her.

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:07.623
She wanted
a connection so badly.

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:11.890
And I just didn't care.

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:15.831
I didn't need her anym

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:52.602
My grandmother
left the house to both of them.

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.734
My mom
wanted to sell it

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:57.505
My uncle
wanted to live in it.

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:00.540
Typical family bullshit.

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:01.673
Mmm-hmm.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.378
One night,
they were up at the house, fighting.

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.247
He was really
fucked up.

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:11.859
He pushed her.

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:16.792
She fell down
a flight of stairs. Cracked her skull.

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:22.964
She bled out so quick
by the time the ambulance got there,

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.470
she was already dead.

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.704
I had just
passed the bar.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.439
I was desperate
to try my first case, I...

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.817
I never thought
that that would be it.

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:45.652
How can you defend a person
that kills your own mother?

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.263
I knew
it was an accident.

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:59.738
Does it ever piss you off
that he's alive and she isn'

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:04.968
All the time.

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:07.331
Stop shooting us!

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:36.194
Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:40.572
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:45.837
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:53.415
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.045
Get back.

01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:01.952
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:48.492
Let's go!

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:50.060
Come on!

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:54.365
I'm ready!
Come fucking shoot me! Come on!

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.806
Come get me!

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:13.524
You need to
get out of here.

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:16.187
If you don't vacate
the premises, I will arrest you, son.

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:17.254
I'm not your son.

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.560
What's your name,
young man?

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:19.690
I ain't gotta
tell you that.

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:20.996
Listen, I'm not
trying to hurt you,

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.832
I'm just trying to
clear the streets and do my job.

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:23.894
You're not supposed
to be here.

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:25.495
Okay,
so what you gonna do? You gonna shoot me?

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.098
You gonna shoot me
if I don't leave?

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.676
No. But I will
arrest you.

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.877
Listen, man.
I'm begging you. Just go home.

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:33.038
All right?

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:37.374
What you...

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.018
And a young man
was killed.

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:29.153
His father came out
and said he fixed your car.

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.391
What do you mean
he was killed?

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:33.159
He shot
a police officer in the face.

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:35.399
We were just
with him.

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:39.202
You knew the boy?

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:42.067
We spent some
time with him.

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:43.735
Did you order him
to do it?

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:44.835
Are you crazy?

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:46.642
We would
never do that.

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:49.012
These kids, they think
it's okay to kill cops 'cause of you.

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:50.574
Who made it okay
for cops to kill us?

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:52.175
We didn't
want this.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.817
There's a war
going on out there

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.822
and you welcome this
into our home?

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:57.085
They didn't start it.

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.255
I want them gone
by the morning.

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:01.255
We can leave right now.

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:02.857
Hey. Hey.

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:07.165
Don't let your pride
get you killed. I ain't staying here.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:10.261
Look, I got hiding spots
all over this place.

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:13.263
Even if the cops come,
they won't find you.

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:17.074
This is a safe place.
Right?

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:23.442
Y'all hungry?

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:26.045
Come on.

01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:34.695
There's a bounty
out on your heads.

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.059
How much we worth?

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.222
Two-fifty.

01:30:38.299 --> 01:30:40.063
Total?

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:41.465
That ain't much.

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:42.934
It's enough to pay
our mortgage off.

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:44.232
You gonna turn us in?

01:30:44.305 --> 01:30:45.466
No.

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:49.601
Earl told me
you need a plane.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.802
Yeah.

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:54.973
I know a guy in Florida.
I already gave him a call.

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.814
This is his address
and directions to his house.

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:02.481
If you lose that,
you're fucked.

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.251
Let's eat
before it gets cold.

01:31:06.727 --> 01:31:07.820
I'll lead us in prayer.

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:09.055
May I?

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:10.553
Of course.

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:23.675
I'd like to start
by thanking God for the breath in my lungs.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.640
I'm grateful that
we have a place to sleep tonight.

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:32.014
Food to put
in our bellies.

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.953
Thank you for
bringing us this far.

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:41.588
Thank you
for this journey.

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.000
No matter how it ends.

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:48.629
Amen.

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:50.331
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.300
Get upstairs now!

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:23.399
What's going on?
Just go.

01:32:23.504 --> 01:32:24.801
Get under the bed
in our room.

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.303
Take the back stairs!

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:43.046
Police!

01:32:43.424 --> 01:32:44.414
Police!

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:46.983
Hands on the table!
Tell us where they are!

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.253
Living room clear.

01:32:52.099 --> 01:32:53.089
May I help you?

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.896
Hands on the table!
Tell us where they are!

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:55.992
Upstairs!

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:57.360
Who's they?

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:14.612
Closet, clear!

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.091
Clear!

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:48.585
You tell us
where they went, we'll let you go

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.647
and you can enjoy
the rest of your evening.

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:52.717
Now, how can I tell you where they went

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.227
if they were
never here?

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:57.492
Then where'd the fancy car
come from?

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:03.461
People park their cars
around here all the time.

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:13.004
You look a lot smarter
than your husband.

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:16.242
You wanna tell me
where they went?

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:23.985
Sergeant?

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:43.839
We have to leave here at some point.

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:46.139
I'm not trying to walk
into an ambush.

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:47.875
I heard cars
leave hours ago.

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:51.018
I'm sure they left some folks
behind to keep an eye on the house.

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:53.052
You can stay here
and die of starvation if you want to,

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:54.678
but I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:46.063
They gotta
be out front.

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:56.873
We gotta jump.

01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:00.914
Man, that's too high.

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:07.059
All you gotta do is bend
your knees when you hit the ground, okay?

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:08.891
Bend and roll.

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.453
This ain't no damn
fire drill.

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:16.096
Hold on.

01:36:16.203 --> 01:36:17.466
Okay. Okay.

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:24.302
Okay.

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:28.973
Fuck!

01:36:43.264 --> 01:36:44.322
All right?

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:49.325
We need to move.
We need to move.

01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:52.932
I'm gonna need you to get up.
I'm gonna need you to get up, all right?

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.841
Lean on me.
Lean on me. Lean on me.

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:09.617
Stay here.
I'm gonna check out front, okay?

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:30.375
Over here. Over here.

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:33.478
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:41.988
Okay, I know I can do this,
but you gotta promise not to scream.

01:37:42.056 --> 01:37:43.216
Can you do that?

01:37:43.657 --> 01:37:44.852
I believe in you.

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:49.125
I think there are cops
out front and if they hear you, it's over.

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.357
We're done.

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:53.633
I know how strong
you are.

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:56.727
You can do this.

01:37:57.838 --> 01:37:59.363
Wait. Give me
your jacket.

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:03.143
Here. Take that.

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:08.539
All right.

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:12.008
One.

01:38:18.158 --> 01:38:19.148
Two.

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:33.035
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:38.537
Did you hear that?

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:40.205
Hear what?

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.174
It sounds like
somebody's crying.

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:47.118
That's just nature.

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:50.220
You city boys
ain't used to that shit.

01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:52.718
Don't refer to me as a boy.
I ain't no boy.

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.124
You know what I meant.

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:56.856
I know the difference between
a person and an animal, too.

01:38:57.698 --> 01:38:59.188
Then go walk around.

01:38:59.934 --> 01:39:01.561
You watch
how you talk to me, man.

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:04.097
Ooh. Touchy, touchy.

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:18.144
I need to find
a screwdriver.

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:19.617
You know how
to boost a car?

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.052
I used to. My older brother
taught me one summer.

01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:25.415
Toolbox.

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:31.321
The only car
we ever stole was my dad's.

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:34.492
He should have known
better than to leave that Acura around us.

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:22.104
Damn it!

01:40:56.984 --> 01:40:58.816
Now how we supposed
to get out of here?

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:50.928
What was it?

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:55.739
A couple of deer caught
in some branches. I set them free.

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:57.369
Told you.

01:42:29.343 --> 01:42:30.469
What you doing?

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:38.511
Are you crazy?
Get back in the car!

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:48.818
Fuck.

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.043
Are you trying to die?

01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:11.516
No. I just always
wanted to do that.

01:43:11.618 --> 01:43:13.552
Well, don't do it
when I'm driving.

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:16.349
You should try it.
No, I'm good.

01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:17.515
Pull over.

01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:19.716
Come on, pull over.

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:21.951
Pull over!

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:25.488
If I do it, will you please
let me drive the rest of the way in peace?

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:26.794
Swear to God.

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:28.232
Swear on something
you believe in.

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:30.396
Okay, fine.

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:32.671
I'll swear on you.

01:43:59.733 --> 01:44:01.030
Fuck, man.

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:02.927
Shit.

01:44:12.512 --> 01:44:14.003
Shit!
Oh, shit!

01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:15.675
Fuck it.
I'm coming back in.

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.717
No, no, no. You got it.
You got it. You're good.

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:19.580
I'll just drive slow.

01:46:02.456 --> 01:46:04.219
Are you sure
this is the place?

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:17.835
Will you please get
back in the car before you get shot?

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:35.651
Well, there isn't one.

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:36.985
I can see that.

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:40.751
They're gonna find us.

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.192
No, they're not.

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:48.994
How about you
get in the back and get some sleep?

01:46:50.103 --> 01:46:51.366
I'll sit here, huh?

01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:53.863
Make sure nobody kills us.

01:47:09.456 --> 01:47:10.582
Take that.

01:47:12.359 --> 01:47:13.349
Thanks.

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:40.550
I can't sleep.

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:44.489
You want me
to turn on the radio?

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:45.581
No.

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:48.955
I want you to
tell me a story.

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:51.958
What kind of story?

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:53.992
Any story.
I don't care.

01:48:06.613 --> 01:48:09.344
When I was little,
I asked my mom where babies come from.

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:11.911
She said I was
too young to know.

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.454
Then I asked my dad.

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:16.448
He said,

01:48:17.023 --> 01:48:20.585
"Babies are a product of two people
that needed something from each other."

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:23.686
So, I said,
"Needed what?"

01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:26.793
He said, "Maybe they
needed to feel seen."

01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:30.135
"Maybe they needed
to feel loved."

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:34.004
"Maybe they needed
to feel human."

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:40.438
And then what?

01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:42.371
Then I asked
my grandmother.

01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:45.345
She said,
"Babies come from God."

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:50.283
"They're His way
of making sure no one ever really dies."

01:48:53.126 --> 01:48:54.491
I remember her saying,

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:57.825
"Through our children,
we are reborn."

01:49:06.006 --> 01:49:07.530
Then I went
to my older brother.

01:49:08.842 --> 01:49:10.071
And I asked him.

01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:12.139
And he said,

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.405
"Nobody knows.
You're just born."

01:49:15.515 --> 01:49:17.506
"That's it.
Now leave me alone."

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:23.687
I wasn't satisfied with
that answer either, but...

01:49:25.559 --> 01:49:28.585
I ran out of family
members to ask, so he got the last word.

01:49:33.433 --> 01:49:34.992
, who was right?

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:38.397
None of them.

01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:44.566
Babies come from fucking.

01:49:47.714 --> 01:49:49.011
Plain and simple.

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:23.382
Why y'all acting
all scared and shit?

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:25.884
'Cause you're pointing
a gun in my face.

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:29.547
Man, I'm just fucking
with you, player.

01:50:29.623 --> 01:50:30.647
Come on.

01:50:31.324 --> 01:50:32.382
You know the Shepherds?

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:34.151
Hell, yeah.

01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:36.227
Hey, come on, man.
Let's go.

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:37.456
How we know
you ain't lying?

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:39.154
I mean, you don't.

01:50:39.265 --> 01:50:40.665
Then why should
we go with you?

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:42.235
What other choice
do you have?

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:54.138
Well, how do you
know the Shepherds?

01:50:54.247 --> 01:50:55.806
From way back.
How long?

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:58.676
Damn, man,
why you giving me the third degree?

01:50:58.785 --> 01:50:59.809
I'm trying to
help you out.

01:50:59.919 --> 01:51:01.114
They said
you had a plane.

01:51:01.187 --> 01:51:02.246
Oh, they lied
about that one.

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:04.256
If you ain't got a plane,
we're not going with you.

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:06.690
Look, man, I ain't got
that kind of money.

01:51:07.093 --> 01:51:08.459
But I got a friend
that do.

01:51:08.928 --> 01:51:11.022
He a bailer.
He can get you whatever you want.

01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:13.759
When we get to my trailer,
I'll give him a call for you.

01:51:13.833 --> 01:51:15.301
Why can't you
call him right now?

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:17.803
'Cause I ain't got
my phone on me. Damn!

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:23.169
Look, y'all can either roll with
me or stand here like some dummies

01:51:23.276 --> 01:51:25.176
and wait for the police
to come get you.

01:51:58.511 --> 01:51:59.740
Yeah, all right.
For sure.

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:04.480
All right, I got you.

01:52:05.719 --> 01:52:07.550
Well, if it's all right,
I'll see you then.

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:11.589
He gonna have the plane
ready to go first thing tomorrow morning.

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:13.819
We can't
wait till tomorrow. We gotta go now.

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.026
Damn, y'all some bossy
motherfuckers.

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:17.556
Call him back.

01:52:18.264 --> 01:52:19.596
Hey, man, back up.

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:29.535
Hey, sorry, bro.
They tripping.

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:32.842
Yeah, they said
they gotta go today, nigga.

01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:38.608
That's what
I told them.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:41.778
All right.

01:52:44.257 --> 01:52:45.349
Bet.

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:47.894
He said meet him
in an hour. All right, cool.

01:52:52.766 --> 01:52:54.427
Hell, what the fuck
is y'all doing?

01:52:55.135 --> 01:52:56.796
It's an hour away.
We gotta go.

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:17.053
Y'all wanna
hit this shit?

01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:19.615
I don't smoke.

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:22.557
Word.
What about you, sis?

01:53:23.129 --> 01:53:24.153
I'm good.

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:25.988
Shit.

01:53:27.801 --> 01:53:30.929
If I was y'all, I'd be smoking
like a motherfucker right now.

01:53:32.839 --> 01:53:34.637
That's why I be
smoking all the time.

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.673
Paranoid as fuck.

01:53:38.244 --> 01:53:40.110
I always think somebody's
trying to kill me.

01:53:41.414 --> 01:53:42.404
Like who?

01:53:42.916 --> 01:53:44.076
Shit. Police.

01:53:51.024 --> 01:53:52.321
What you gonna do?

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:54.986
Yeah.

01:53:58.298 --> 01:53:59.959
Hell, I'm glad
I met y'all, though.

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:02.164
So are we, man.

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:06.137
Yeah, /all... Y'all really gave
niggas something to believe in.

01:54:07.774 --> 01:54:09.367
We needed
that for real.

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:19.114
Yo, let me hit that.

01:54:22.121 --> 01:54:24.022
I knew you wanted
to hit that shit.

01:54:42.575 --> 01:54:45.738
Yeah.
Live your life, sis.

01:55:50.743 --> 01:55:52.143
There the nigga
go right there.

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:01.713
Thank you.

01:56:48.501 --> 01:56:50.629
Get down! You're under arrest!

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:55.635
Get on the ground, now!

01:56:58.177 --> 01:57:00.271
/ am not gonna say it again!

01:57:02.648 --> 01:57:03.946
Get on the ground!

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:07.347
I'll never let go
of your hand.

01:57:15.128 --> 01:57:16.459
Get on the ground!

01:57:20.533 --> 01:57:21.967
Had a chance,

01:57:24.037 --> 01:57:25.800
I would have kissed
all your scars.

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:32.469
I know you would have.

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:35.845
You're under arrest!

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:38.984
Get on the ground!

01:57:40.853 --> 01:57:42.150
I'm not gonna say it again!

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:44.714
Get on the ground now!

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:48.583
You're under arrest!

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:54.900
Can I be your legacy?

01:57:56.369 --> 01:57:57.359
You already are.

01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:00.570
Hold your fire!

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:02.670
Stand down!

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:04.228
Step away from the girl!

01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:06.997
Stand down right now!
Stand down!

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:09.741
Show me your hands!

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:19.583
Stop! Don't do it!

01:59:35.168 --> 01:59:36.499
Put the girl down!

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:42.770
Stop right there!

01:59:49.315 --> 01:59:50.544
You hear me?

01:59:52.218 --> 01:59:54.710
Do not take another step!

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:04.219
Take another step
and we will shoot!

02:01:05.124 --> 02:01:06.853
Angela Johnson and Ernest Mines

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:10.123
were shot and killed today
by Monroe County Police.

02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:12.129
The two suspects
have become quite infamous

02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:15.098
for their ability to escape
authorities across state lines

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:17.795
after killing Officer Reed
in Cleveland, Ohio.

02:01:18.904 --> 02:01:21.135
Monroe County
Police Department released a statement

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:23.208
saying they had hoped
to arrest the suspects

02:01:23.276 --> 02:01:25.107
so that they could have
their day in court,

02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:27.373
but they had no choice
but to open fire,

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:30.439
because the suspects
were armed and considered dangerous.

02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:34.877
/f was a tragic ending
to a six-day nationwide manhunt

02:01:35.721 --> 02:01:37.382
The pursuit that
began in Ohio,

02:01:37.456 --> 02:01:39.152
ended on
a Florida tarmac

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:43.127
yards away from a jet plane that was
intended to be their form of escape.

02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:46.124
Despite the two
being wanted for murder,

02:01:46.232 --> 02:01:48.792
hundreds of thousands
of people across the nation

02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:51.336
pledged their support
gathering in the streets,

02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:54.896
protesting against
the fallen officer, who shot and killed

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:59.241
an unarmed black man
just two years ago in an unrelated incident

02:01:59.312 --> 02:02:01.940
Johnson and Mines became
a social media phenomenon...

02:02:06.686 --> 02:02:09.814
Dashcam footage linked
them to the shooting death of an officer...

02:06:46.298 --> 02:06:48.892
What if God
wanted me to die and / messed up His plan?

02:06:48.968 --> 02:06:51.562
- / don't think that's what He wanted.
- How do you know?

02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:51.562
/ just think you were
meant to be here.
