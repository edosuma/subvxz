WEBVTT

00:01.094 --> 00:02.437
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:02.461 --> 00:03.574
BRUCE: I found this when I was in the city.

00:03.575 --> 00:06.085
GORDON: Penguin's licenses.
Apparently crime is legal now.

00:06.133 --> 00:07.660
I got a license. (grunts)

00:07.685 --> 00:10.466
GORDON: I am not giving the city
over to Penguin.

00:10.491 --> 00:12.037
I don't care what the commissioner says.

00:12.072 --> 00:13.571
Oswald Cobblepot

00:13.607 --> 00:15.396
keeps your friends safe.

00:15.421 --> 00:17.309
Not the GCPD.

00:17.344 --> 00:19.144
- Is Barbara around?
- No.

00:19.179 --> 00:20.779
- (screams)
- TABITHA: And she's not coming back.

00:20.814 --> 00:22.914
I want more.

00:22.950 --> 00:23.915
(whip cracks)

00:26.954 --> 00:28.553
Jonathan Crane's father

00:28.588 --> 00:30.259
created a toxin that makes people

00:30.306 --> 00:32.924
- see their greatest fear.
- (screams)

00:32.960 --> 00:35.260
Jonathan, you're going with these men.

00:35.295 --> 00:36.995
MERTON: Now, you're gonna
take your daddy's notebooks

00:37.030 --> 00:39.364
and make as much
of that fear juice as I say.

00:39.399 --> 00:40.999
(screams)

00:41.034 --> 00:42.300
(whimpers)

00:42.336 --> 00:43.835
- (glass cracking)
- Oh, no.

00:46.039 --> 00:48.006
Gotham Police! You're under arrest!

00:48.041 --> 00:49.407
- GRADY: Crane?
- SCARECROW: Jonathan Crane

00:49.443 --> 00:51.242
isn't here anymore.

00:51.278 --> 00:52.777
It's just the Scarecrow.

00:52.813 --> 00:53.812
(screams)

00:54.881 --> 00:56.748
(siren chirps)

00:56.783 --> 00:58.783
(thunder rumbles)

01:03.991 --> 01:06.658
GORDON: This is where Merton
said they would be.

01:06.693 --> 01:07.874
Let's go, everybody.

01:07.899 --> 01:09.797
- Stay sharp.
- (gun cocks)

Advertise your product or brand here

01:19.373 --> 01:21.639
There's no one here.

01:21.675 --> 01:23.942
They're long gone by now.

01:25.512 --> 01:27.846
This place smells like death.

01:27.881 --> 01:30.515
Reminds me... there's
a Thai joint not far away,

01:30.540 --> 01:31.954
if you want to grab something
to eat after.

01:31.979 --> 01:34.391
- Very funny.
- It's the toxin.

01:34.416 --> 01:36.817
And they made more of it.

01:38.025 --> 01:39.491
BULLOCK: Looky here.

01:39.526 --> 01:41.459
An asylum uniform.

01:41.495 --> 01:42.961
1109.

01:42.996 --> 01:44.496
That's Crane's number, right?

01:48.568 --> 01:50.001
(thunder rumbles)

02:11.553 --> 02:12.953
(gasping)

02:12.978 --> 02:14.559
He's coming!

02:14.594 --> 02:16.661
Who?

02:17.111 --> 02:19.397
Scarecrow!

ALFRED: Right,
thank you very much, Officer.

02:34.848 --> 02:37.048
(phone dialing)

02:37.084 --> 02:40.018
Alfred, you need to explain this
was just a misunderstanding.

02:40.246 --> 02:42.728
Worry not, Master Bruce,
we have Wayne Enterprises'

02:42.753 --> 02:46.357
most talented and expensive
lawyer on the case.

02:46.393 --> 02:49.027
He'll have you out in a jiffy.

02:49.062 --> 02:50.428
How'd they nick you, anyway?

02:50.464 --> 02:52.263
I fell through the skylight.

02:52.299 --> 02:54.570
These thieves must have
triggered an alarm.

02:54.595 --> 02:57.076
The police were so quick to respond.
I wasn't expecting that, Alfred.

02:57.101 --> 02:58.477
Yeah, well, you could have
broke your bloody neck.

02:58.523 --> 03:00.328
I had them red-handed.

03:00.352 --> 03:01.960
- If I could've only...
- Only what?

03:01.961 --> 03:04.073
Only taken on an entire crew
twice your size?

03:04.098 --> 03:05.651
Perhaps, yes.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.055
GORDON: Well, here's something
you don't see every day.

03:10.832 --> 03:12.753
Bruce Wayne behind bars.

03:12.778 --> 03:14.364
There's been a terrible
mistake, Detective Gordon.

03:14.419 --> 03:17.037
You see, I fell in from the roof
into a robbery in progress.

03:17.062 --> 03:19.756
- I wasn't breaking in.
- Is that so?

03:19.791 --> 03:22.292
Why were you up on the roof?

03:23.729 --> 03:26.229
I was looking for Selina Kyle.

03:27.299 --> 03:28.665
(chuckles softly)

03:28.700 --> 03:30.600
I see.

03:30.636 --> 03:33.307
ALFRED: Yes. Uh, we will,
of course, have our lawyer

03:33.332 --> 03:34.504
post bail, Detective Gordon.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.738
I hardly think that's necessary.

03:37.376 --> 03:39.309
(clears throat)

03:40.679 --> 03:42.646
We'll talk more about this, Bruce.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.015
But not tonight.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.217
Thank you, Detective.

03:47.252 --> 03:49.519
(mouths)

03:51.056 --> 03:52.355
Thank you.

03:52.391 --> 03:54.791
(Grady shouting)

03:54.826 --> 03:56.159
(shrieks)

03:57.729 --> 04:00.597

04:00.632 --> 04:01.731
(lock buzzes)

04:01.767 --> 04:04.568
(indistinct chatter)

04:04.594 --> 04:06.047
GUARD: <i>Locking 'em up.</i>

04:06.171 --> 04:09.586
<i>Everybody in bed. Everybody in bed.</i>

04:16.348 --> 04:19.082
(metallic scraping)

04:19.117 --> 04:20.584
(gasps)

04:21.320 --> 04:24.188
Covering your dirty footprints, Warden?

04:26.425 --> 04:28.858
It's too late, I'm afraid.

04:29.342 --> 04:31.834
Your dirty deeds have...

04:32.115 --> 04:33.863
stained you.

04:34.777 --> 04:37.679
- How did you get in here?
- Come on.

04:37.704 --> 04:42.025
You don't spend three years
in this hellish place

04:42.072 --> 04:45.010
- without picking up a thing or two.
- (blade bangs)

04:45.593 --> 04:47.128
Jonathan?

04:48.247 --> 04:49.760
That's right.

04:49.847 --> 04:54.823
I'm not the same frightened boy
you threw in a cell.

04:54.909 --> 04:58.088
No treatments, no therapy.

04:58.113 --> 05:01.425
Just some ice baths and some...
(imitates buzzing)

05:01.560 --> 05:03.860
...electric shocks, once in a while.

05:04.980 --> 05:07.223
You know, you could just leave.

05:07.317 --> 05:09.106
I wouldn't tell anyone.

05:09.166 --> 05:11.324
I don't want to leave, Warden.

05:11.403 --> 05:13.470
(phone rings)

05:15.007 --> 05:17.374
- Oh!
- Now, are you paying attention?!

05:17.409 --> 05:18.975
Yeah.

05:19.208 --> 05:22.579
I cured myself.

05:23.005 --> 05:26.742
You see, I feared the scarecrow.

05:28.242 --> 05:31.671
- And now we are one.
- Jonathan...

05:31.710 --> 05:33.456
please, if you'll just...

05:33.492 --> 05:37.460
You're not listening to me, Warden!

05:37.496 --> 05:40.330
Jonathan Crane is no more.

05:40.365 --> 05:43.281
Call me by my true name.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.269
(distorted): The Scarecrow.

05:47.606 --> 05:51.508
(moans)

05:51.543 --> 05:53.310
(screaming)

05:56.348 --> 05:58.448
(indistinct chatter)

05:58.483 --> 06:00.594
LUCIUS: Rough night, Bruce?

06:01.186 --> 06:02.986
Get into a fight?

06:03.021 --> 06:04.469
ALFRED: No, he fell through a skylight.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.656
He was on the rooftops,
looking for Selina Kyle.

06:06.980 --> 06:09.280
Bloody teenagers, eh? Ooh.

06:09.377 --> 06:11.742
But your clothes... looks more like

06:11.767 --> 06:13.363
concrete and stone residue, though.

06:13.398 --> 06:14.998
What were you doing before that?

06:15.033 --> 06:16.833
Rock climbing.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.693
- Rock climbing.
- Yes, we were rock climbing.

06:19.748 --> 06:21.037
Alfred's been teaching me.

06:21.608 --> 06:23.206
At the rock faces in...

06:23.490 --> 06:24.941
the s-south gardens.

06:25.350 --> 06:27.443
Taken to it
like a duck to water, he has.

06:27.468 --> 06:29.379
But we've got to plod on, Mr. Fox.

06:29.414 --> 06:31.898
Of course. Sorry to have kept you.

06:32.484 --> 06:35.251
Be careful on those rocks, Bruce.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.616
It's a dangerous sport.

06:40.578 --> 06:43.953
We will, Mr. Fox. We will.

06:46.331 --> 06:47.397
(moans)

06:48.031 --> 06:51.093
Did you know my father was a genius?

06:51.299 --> 06:54.109
He wanted to end fear.

06:54.339 --> 06:55.805
For my sake.

06:55.841 --> 06:58.375
Because he loved me.

06:58.410 --> 06:59.876
So, tell me:

06:59.911 --> 07:03.587
what do you fear, Warden?

07:06.899 --> 07:08.643
Something from your...

07:08.755 --> 07:10.720
childhood, maybe?

07:10.756 --> 07:12.422
(roaring)

07:12.457 --> 07:13.790
(screaming)

07:18.997 --> 07:22.491
Face your fears.

07:22.934 --> 07:27.796
Face your fears, and defeat them.

07:31.943 --> 07:34.110
(clown shrieks)

07:34.146 --> 07:36.279
(groans)

07:43.822 --> 07:44.888
(clown hissing)

07:49.851 --> 07:51.998
(distorted): What? No.

07:52.023 --> 07:53.596
(gunshots)

08:10.515 --> 08:12.914
Brothers and sisters.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.367
Look at you.

08:14.492 --> 08:15.758
Prisoners,

08:15.910 --> 08:17.153
all of you.

08:17.461 --> 08:20.256
My father would have freed you.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.321
But he was killed.

08:22.477 --> 08:25.212
Murdered by the GCPD.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.330
Men who couldn't understand.

08:27.365 --> 08:28.898
(yelling)

08:29.535 --> 08:31.309
But they will.

08:31.358 --> 08:33.885
For you will be my army.

08:33.910 --> 08:35.772
(all yelling)

08:35.807 --> 08:38.450
And those men who killed my father

08:38.528 --> 08:42.345
shall truly know fear.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.379
(screams)

08:45.450 --> 08:47.450
(screaming)

08:54.127 --> 08:56.695
(indistinct chatter)

08:57.486 --> 08:58.885
James Gordon?

08:58.921 --> 09:01.849
James Gordon?

09:01.881 --> 09:03.881
There you are.

09:07.146 --> 09:08.345
Play nice.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.427
No.

09:12.908 --> 09:14.775
I see you've caught one of them.

09:14.810 --> 09:16.619
What about the other fellow?

09:16.644 --> 09:18.966
I have no idea who you're talking about.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.191
Jonathan Crane?

09:21.227 --> 09:22.793
People share with me

09:22.828 --> 09:24.862
because they trust me
to get things done.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.463
Unlike you.

09:26.499 --> 09:30.301
So, this boy who created
this lethal toxin

09:30.363 --> 09:32.870
which almost killed me... where is he?

09:33.488 --> 09:36.240
- Whereabouts unknown, for now.
- (chuckles)

09:36.683 --> 09:39.756
Why am I not surprised? I mean, really,

09:39.834 --> 09:42.980
the only thing the GCPD knows
how to do well is fail.

09:43.397 --> 09:45.364
What is a penguin...

09:45.435 --> 09:47.151
a bird or a mammal?

09:47.186 --> 09:49.052
Bird.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.521
It is a bird.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.356
Like a chicken?

09:52.391 --> 09:54.424
(laughter)

09:54.460 --> 09:56.940
REPORTER: Get a shot of that, will you?

09:57.096 --> 10:00.387
Time and time again,
the GCPD expose themselves

10:00.412 --> 10:01.731
for what they truly are:

10:02.058 --> 10:05.665
an outdated, ineffectual
and corrupt institution.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.631
How much longer must our citizens

10:08.656 --> 10:10.007
suffer their incompetence?

10:10.049 --> 10:11.974
This, coming from a man who takes money

10:11.999 --> 10:13.834
from criminals in exchange for a license

10:13.859 --> 10:15.933
allowing them to victimize
innocent people.

10:15.958 --> 10:17.748
And it is working.

10:18.267 --> 10:20.901
Jim, why can't you see that

10:20.926 --> 10:24.720
I am not here to destroy
your beloved GCPD,

10:24.745 --> 10:26.723
but to save it.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.026
And, through that, Gotham.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.987
Your licenses are illegal

10:31.012 --> 10:33.597
and I will arrest anyone
I find who is issued one.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.524
So sure your Boy Scout morality

10:39.549 --> 10:41.371
can protect this city, Jim? (chuckles)

10:41.407 --> 10:44.174
How well has that worked in the past?

10:44.210 --> 10:46.782
Should I list the victims

10:46.807 --> 10:49.279
of your antiquated righteousness?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.448
Instead, let me make you a deal.

10:51.483 --> 10:53.083
Find this Jonathan Crane

10:53.118 --> 10:55.417
and lock him up within 24 hours

10:55.442 --> 10:58.550
or admit to me, your subordinates,

10:58.575 --> 11:00.057
and the people of Gotham

11:00.092 --> 11:02.075
that you failed,

11:02.141 --> 11:05.106
and allow me to clean this city up!

11:11.348 --> 11:12.947
(chuckles)

11:12.972 --> 11:14.471
(quietly): Good for you, Jim.

11:14.802 --> 11:16.337
Game on.

11:20.646 --> 11:22.646
(crickets chirping)

11:27.947 --> 11:30.304
What are you doing here?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.220
Have I taught you nothing?

11:33.962 --> 11:36.159
I could've slit your throat
before you even saw me.

11:37.134 --> 11:39.103
I found this on the door this morning.

11:39.243 --> 11:41.210
"An Opportunity Awaits."

11:45.873 --> 11:48.124
Someone left this inside last night.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.150
(door creaks)

12:08.463 --> 12:10.997
Thank you for coming, ladies.

12:16.912 --> 12:18.478
No way.

12:18.542 --> 12:19.803
I saw you die.

12:19.838 --> 12:21.672
(scoffs) That so?

12:22.550 --> 12:24.083
This is Gotham.

12:24.121 --> 12:26.881
- Check for a pulse next time.
- TABITHA: I will.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.046
Right after I slit your throat.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.549
SELINA: So, what happened to you?

12:33.249 --> 12:34.889
Long story.

12:35.312 --> 12:38.947
Right now, all you need
to know is that I'm back.

12:39.155 --> 12:41.391
And like the card says,

12:42.173 --> 12:44.895
an opportunity awaits you.

12:45.328 --> 12:47.295
A new beginning.

12:47.470 --> 12:49.703
You sure you want to get this close?

12:49.728 --> 12:51.034
Please hear me out.

12:51.468 --> 12:54.640
Not a day goes by where I
don't think about what I did.

12:54.772 --> 12:57.538
If I could take it back, trust me,

12:57.669 --> 12:59.035
I would.

13:00.245 --> 13:02.546
I wouldn't mind a do-over myself.

13:02.877 --> 13:05.778
Perhaps I'll finish the job this time.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.852
I was jealous.

13:08.887 --> 13:10.520
I was stupid.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.923
I am sorry.

13:15.928 --> 13:19.296
Kill me if you don't believe me.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.264
(grunts)

13:23.323 --> 13:27.669
SELINA: So, is this your place now?

13:29.935 --> 13:31.708
This is our place.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.478
Another club? In Gotham?

13:35.211 --> 13:36.980
How original.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.149
It's not a club.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.988
(whirring)

13:54.867 --> 13:56.767
(whirring)

14:03.175 --> 14:04.934
Penguin's taking over.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.144
Like it or not,

14:07.589 --> 14:09.593
every criminal in the city

14:09.762 --> 14:11.314
is gonna go to him for a license to mug,

14:11.350 --> 14:13.350
steal, or blow stuff up.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.239
Those criminals are gonna need supplies,

14:15.372 --> 14:18.369
and that is where we come in.

14:18.624 --> 14:22.859
Not only will we be able
to facilitate these lowlives,

14:22.895 --> 14:25.879
but we'll also find out
what they're planning

14:25.926 --> 14:27.631
and how it's going down.

14:28.520 --> 14:32.636
But I will not go forward
without you both.

14:35.069 --> 14:37.270
This is our way back on top.

14:38.263 --> 14:39.810
No.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.920
What you took from me,

14:43.135 --> 14:45.669
I will never be able to get back.

14:46.329 --> 14:49.230
Just feel lucky I don't burn
this place to the ground.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.489
(door opens)

14:52.524 --> 14:54.324
(door closes)

14:55.307 --> 14:57.861
This will be good for all of us.

14:57.914 --> 15:00.247
Please talk to her.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.707
(footsteps approaching)

15:10.742 --> 15:12.242
(door closes)

15:16.394 --> 15:17.664
I don't want to hear it, Alfred.

15:17.689 --> 15:18.955
I'm going back out there.

15:18.980 --> 15:21.251
I'm not gonna let this trail go cold.

15:21.276 --> 15:24.173
Far be it from me to stop you,
Master Bruce.

15:29.966 --> 15:31.656
You're not coming?

15:31.705 --> 15:33.248
No, sir.

15:34.197 --> 15:35.663
And why not?

15:36.082 --> 15:39.035
Because, as last night proved, you...

15:40.378 --> 15:42.441
are simply not ready.

15:42.466 --> 15:44.569
Yeah, you can chuck a
punch, you can block one.

15:44.594 --> 15:46.203
You're quick on your toes,
I'll give you that.

15:47.089 --> 15:50.148
What if they got guns, Master Bruce?

15:52.383 --> 15:54.071
Out there,

15:54.429 --> 15:57.863
Alfred, I feel more alive
than I've ever felt before.

15:59.888 --> 16:01.478
Do you understand that?

16:04.131 --> 16:08.045
And that is precisely why
I am not stopping you, sir.

16:09.608 --> 16:12.022
But you'll excuse me
if I don't want to stand by

16:12.085 --> 16:13.726
and watch you get shot.

16:17.846 --> 16:21.180
(door opens, slams)

16:21.205 --> 16:22.799
(siren wailing in distance)

16:23.728 --> 16:26.599
Hey. The mental asylum's under siege.

16:26.624 --> 16:28.157
The lunatics are running riot.

16:28.182 --> 16:30.249
The guards called it in before
they bolted for the hills.

16:30.284 --> 16:32.318
- Crane?
- He made more toxins, right?

16:32.353 --> 16:34.653
What happens when you dose
a hundred nutjobs?

16:34.689 --> 16:36.255
All right, listen up!

16:36.290 --> 16:37.984
There's a riot at the asylum!

16:38.009 --> 16:39.948
I need as many of you as can come!

16:39.973 --> 16:41.339
Who's with me?

16:43.870 --> 16:45.471
Good luck with that.

16:46.417 --> 16:50.174
You really think Penguin
is gonna make this go away?!

16:50.674 --> 16:53.102
He's just getting rich
off the same lowlives

16:53.127 --> 16:55.728
you guys used to hate as much as me!

16:58.564 --> 16:59.945
Ah, forget it.

16:59.981 --> 17:02.638
Not one of you is fit to wear the badge.

17:02.663 --> 17:06.458
This badge gets us spat on
and shot at every day!

17:06.854 --> 17:08.255
For what?

17:08.689 --> 17:10.814
What difference have we made out there?

17:10.839 --> 17:13.157
- OFFICER: Yeah, he's right.
- OFFICER 2: That's what I'm saying.

17:13.194 --> 17:14.962
Let's go, Harvey.

17:23.329 --> 17:24.737
Come on. Don't do this.

17:24.771 --> 17:27.339
I told you, one day, that
you would say, "Now or never."

17:27.470 --> 17:31.343
And I would say, "Never."
Well, today is that day.

17:31.379 --> 17:33.512
If I go with you, I lose them.

17:33.555 --> 17:35.451
And then who's gonna be
the new captain, huh?

17:35.499 --> 17:39.067
Because it's damn well gonna be
someone Penguin chooses.

17:39.455 --> 17:41.421
So I am sorry, partner,

17:41.613 --> 17:44.013
but you are on your own on this one.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.567
Yeah.

17:58.775 --> 18:00.609
(thunder rumbles)

18:19.642 --> 18:22.001
- (snarling)
- (gun cocks)

18:22.166 --> 18:23.832
(shrieking)

18:27.803 --> 18:29.538
GCPD!

18:31.592 --> 18:33.608
GCPD.

18:33.977 --> 18:37.312
(indistinct shouting)

18:42.319 --> 18:45.053
(cackling)

18:45.089 --> 18:49.524
I'm not scared of you anymore!
You see, I am you! (laughs)

18:49.560 --> 18:50.726
(groans)

18:50.761 --> 18:53.095
(cackling)

18:56.776 --> 18:58.175
(gun cocks)

19:08.087 --> 19:09.417
(snarls)

19:09.442 --> 19:11.948
Ah. It's you.

19:13.393 --> 19:14.325
(shouts)

19:14.360 --> 19:15.960
(wails)

19:16.651 --> 19:18.612
You came.

19:19.361 --> 19:22.041
- (feedback over P.A.)
- CRANE: <i>Brothers and sisters,</i>

19:22.066 --> 19:24.666
<i>the enemy is here.</i>

19:25.786 --> 19:27.620
(lock buzzes)

19:27.936 --> 19:29.903
(shouting)

19:30.207 --> 19:31.640
Crap.

19:34.713 --> 19:38.014
(lock buzzing)

19:39.685 --> 19:41.485
<i>Tonight, Detective,</i>

19:41.705 --> 19:44.955
<i>you will pay for what you've done.</i>

19:45.102 --> 19:48.137
<i>Tonight, you will know fear.</i>

19:50.229 --> 19:51.828
(shouting)

19:57.336 --> 19:58.301
(gun cocks)

19:58.337 --> 20:00.255
(gun clicks)

20:00.294 --> 20:01.865
- (shouting)
- Get him.

20:01.890 --> 20:04.057
Keep going, keep going.

20:04.082 --> 20:05.982
(gunshots)

20:09.882 --> 20:13.283
(filtered breathing)

20:13.318 --> 20:15.285
All right, Mr. Cop,

20:15.683 --> 20:18.155
let's have some real fun.

20:18.190 --> 20:19.656
(thunder rumbles)

20:23.606 --> 20:25.506
(gasps)

20:25.531 --> 20:27.931
(chuckles)

20:27.966 --> 20:29.797
My, my!

20:30.058 --> 20:32.430
Well, come on in, I guess.

20:33.071 --> 20:35.505
Word was you were dead.

20:35.541 --> 20:38.575
(chuckles)
Imagine my surprise when I hear

20:38.610 --> 20:40.177
you've popped back up, alive,

20:40.212 --> 20:42.167
and gone and opened
a brand-new business.

20:42.192 --> 20:43.580
(laughs)

20:43.615 --> 20:46.786
- Ooh.
- We're not open yet.

20:49.354 --> 20:51.521
- Looks pretty open to me.
- (gun clicks)

20:51.557 --> 20:53.089
Yeah, I'd say it's open.

20:53.125 --> 20:55.525
Hot damn, it's like Christmas.

20:55.561 --> 20:58.770
Which is upsetting, because
this was definitely something

20:58.805 --> 21:00.507
you would want to run by me first.

21:00.625 --> 21:01.912
Is it, now?

21:02.029 --> 21:04.029
Oh, yes, absolutely.

21:06.104 --> 21:09.601
All enterprises pertaining to
the criminal underworld shall,

21:09.626 --> 21:12.576
from this time forth,
be approved, monitored,

21:12.686 --> 21:14.544
- and taxed by me.
- Hmm.

21:14.631 --> 21:16.546
My apologies.

21:16.819 --> 21:19.920
I'm still waiting
for my partners to come aboard.

21:20.052 --> 21:21.623
IVY: Who?

21:22.091 --> 21:23.024
Tabitha?

21:23.184 --> 21:24.717
Selina?

21:25.120 --> 21:27.888
- Perhaps.
- Well, good luck with that.

21:28.694 --> 21:31.645
Slippery characters, the both of them.

21:32.264 --> 21:34.898
Also, people can often carry grudges

21:34.933 --> 21:36.589
after you shoot their boyfriends.

21:36.614 --> 21:39.079
I could talk to them, if you... want.

21:39.104 --> 21:40.704
I distinctly remember
saying you could come

21:40.739 --> 21:42.639
if you kept your mouth shut.

21:47.706 --> 21:49.946
You will need
an operating license, obviously.

21:49.982 --> 21:51.862
Then pay a weapon tax.

21:51.887 --> 21:53.754
- Weapon tax?
- And then,

21:53.855 --> 21:56.502
perhaps your little store can open.

21:56.573 --> 21:58.907
Well, you don't ask
for much now, do you?

21:59.527 --> 22:01.596
I am not asking for enough.

22:03.413 --> 22:07.109
Let me be absolutely clear, Miss Kean.

22:07.384 --> 22:11.252
I will be keeping
a very close eye on you.

22:11.288 --> 22:15.056
The first rumor I hear about you
and your little partners

22:15.092 --> 22:17.892
making moves to contest me,
and Victor...

22:17.928 --> 22:19.627
(gun cocks)

22:19.663 --> 22:21.076
(clicks tongue)

22:21.241 --> 22:23.942
...will end you
with your own merchandise.

22:25.335 --> 22:27.235
Understood.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.974
Couldn't have been cheap.

22:34.001 --> 22:35.579
I'm sorry?

22:36.847 --> 22:38.713
You lost your money on The Sirens Club,

22:39.042 --> 22:40.574
then went missing.

22:40.599 --> 22:42.417
Rumor was you were dead.

22:42.951 --> 22:46.419
And now you're back
with a brand-new fancy place.

22:47.326 --> 22:49.447
Who paid for it?

22:49.659 --> 22:52.260
(Oswald laughs)

22:52.295 --> 22:54.744
You really think
I won't find out who it is?

22:54.998 --> 22:57.398
(laughing)

22:58.246 --> 22:59.622
Ah.

22:59.697 --> 23:01.236
I'm gonna take this.

23:01.271 --> 23:03.605
(door opens)

23:05.342 --> 23:06.975
(door closes)

23:09.012 --> 23:10.445
(door creaks open)

23:15.552 --> 23:17.986
(thunder rumbles)

23:23.760 --> 23:25.593
(thunder rumbles)

23:26.291 --> 23:27.996
Crane?

23:38.341 --> 23:39.707
(sighs)

23:41.578 --> 23:42.911
(snarls)

23:42.936 --> 23:45.070
Do you believe in fate?

23:46.966 --> 23:48.758
I didn't before today,

23:48.825 --> 23:53.388
but you, sir, have made me a believer.

23:53.423 --> 23:57.036
Of all the police in Gotham, it was you.

23:57.331 --> 23:59.765
You... came.

24:01.872 --> 24:03.198
(air hisses)

24:09.206 --> 24:10.878
Jonathan.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.875
What happened to you?

24:14.862 --> 24:18.310
Well, first... you killed my father.

24:18.335 --> 24:20.515
Your father was insane.
He was trying to kill you.

24:20.550 --> 24:22.517
He tried to help me,

24:22.936 --> 24:24.975
help all mankind.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.388
- He was a murderer.
- He was a pioneer!

24:27.424 --> 24:28.823
A genius!

24:28.859 --> 24:31.388
He taught me we can live

24:31.413 --> 24:35.335
our entire lives
imprisoned by our fears,

24:36.288 --> 24:38.533
or we can embrace them.

24:38.568 --> 24:40.201
(gas hissing)

24:43.807 --> 24:46.708
(coughs)

24:47.511 --> 24:49.652
(distorted): You should
know that better than anyone.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.042
You should know that better than anyone.

24:53.021 --> 24:55.655
What will you see, I wonder?

24:58.221 --> 24:59.888
What scares you the most?

24:59.923 --> 25:01.589
(chuckles)

25:09.336 --> 25:11.734
CRANE: What will you see, I wonder?

25:11.938 --> 25:15.165
One of your victims, perhaps?

25:15.719 --> 25:17.534
One of your victims?

25:18.540 --> 25:20.367
What haunts you the most?

25:20.410 --> 25:21.409
(snarls)

25:21.445 --> 25:25.861
(woman screaming in distance)

25:26.049 --> 25:28.183
(glass shatters)

25:30.754 --> 25:32.387
(screaming continues)

25:41.655 --> 25:43.298
Lee?

25:43.333 --> 25:45.100
(gasping)

25:45.135 --> 25:46.735
I just...

25:46.818 --> 25:48.193
I just was...

25:48.248 --> 25:49.571
God, no.

25:50.111 --> 25:51.801
- What have you done?
- Don't touch me!

25:51.826 --> 25:53.008
Let me go!

25:53.043 --> 25:54.867
Please let me help you.

25:54.932 --> 25:56.945
(crying): You've caused me so much pain.

25:58.274 --> 26:00.440
(Thompkins gasping)

26:00.664 --> 26:04.354
I've suffered you long enough.

26:04.488 --> 26:06.288
We could have been a family,

26:06.979 --> 26:08.657
had a child.

26:09.127 --> 26:12.093
You destroy everything you touch.

26:14.430 --> 26:15.596
I just...

26:15.766 --> 26:19.411
want... peace.

26:19.436 --> 26:21.569
No. Lee.

26:21.605 --> 26:24.472
No.

26:25.966 --> 26:28.298
You can join her...

26:28.845 --> 26:33.821
to show her how much you truly love her.

26:36.527 --> 26:40.809
Don't let her die hating you.

26:41.125 --> 26:43.893
It's what she would want.

26:45.696 --> 26:48.045
It's the only way

26:48.085 --> 26:51.435
to show her, love her. Cut deep.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.319
Cut deep. It's what she would want.

26:53.344 --> 26:54.869
Cut deep and find peace.

26:54.905 --> 26:57.117
Don't let her die.

26:57.142 --> 26:58.719
- Follow her...
- No.

26:58.744 --> 27:01.017
- ...into death.
- GORDON: She wouldn't say that.

27:01.042 --> 27:03.306
She wouldn't want that. She loves me.

27:03.331 --> 27:06.696
- Cut deep and find peace.
- No.

27:06.721 --> 27:08.938
She loves me. She loves me.
She wouldn't want that.

27:08.963 --> 27:10.644
She loves me. No.

27:16.174 --> 27:19.075
Crane? Where are you?

27:19.100 --> 27:20.266
- Crane?
- (blade clinks)

27:25.800 --> 27:27.366
How did you do it?

27:27.391 --> 27:30.443
How did you defeat the toxin?
It's impossible!

27:31.695 --> 27:33.509
I overcame my fear.

27:38.579 --> 27:40.355
Liar!

27:42.878 --> 27:44.691
You liar!

27:45.360 --> 27:48.357
You can't just stop being afraid.

27:48.688 --> 27:50.321
(air hisses)

27:52.279 --> 27:55.842
You can only become your demon like I did.

27:55.927 --> 27:58.676
No. You have a choice, Jonathan.

27:59.107 --> 28:01.574
And whatever your father was,
he didn't want this for you.

28:01.610 --> 28:03.076
You need help.

28:03.111 --> 28:05.411
(thunder rumbles)

28:05.462 --> 28:08.329
My father thought that I was weak.

28:09.884 --> 28:12.293
My whole life.

28:12.954 --> 28:15.621
Scared little Jonathan.

28:16.691 --> 28:19.826
Okay. I can help you.

28:20.511 --> 28:22.161
Let me help you.

28:22.722 --> 28:25.431
But I'm not weak anymore.

28:27.128 --> 28:31.505
And I will never go back
to being that boy.

28:39.581 --> 28:44.227
(man laughs)

28:44.252 --> 28:45.786
(car doors closing)

28:45.811 --> 28:47.820
Come on, man. Right this way.

28:47.856 --> 28:48.955
No.

28:48.982 --> 28:51.383
Down this way. Right at the back.

28:51.426 --> 28:53.693
(laughs)

28:53.728 --> 28:55.937
Just around the corner.

28:56.820 --> 28:59.132
I'm telling you, man.
He leaves the back gate open.

28:59.167 --> 29:01.484
(laughs) It's gonna be too easy.

29:13.391 --> 29:15.458
(door creaks)

29:15.483 --> 29:16.883
Well, well.

29:16.918 --> 29:18.918
(laughs)

29:18.953 --> 29:21.231
It seems we've caught our stalker.

29:21.256 --> 29:23.790
- And he made it way too easy.
- (laughing)

29:23.825 --> 29:26.993
Didn't know when he was being played.

29:27.505 --> 29:29.873
- (laughter)
- Who are you, huh?

29:30.432 --> 29:33.466
Some... some Boy Scout?

29:33.501 --> 29:34.967
- He's just a kid.
- (laughter)

29:35.003 --> 29:38.133
You some... some kind of do-gooder?

29:40.020 --> 29:42.062
Did I date your mom
and not call her back?

29:42.087 --> 29:44.754
(laughter)

29:45.073 --> 29:46.906
Why are you hassling us, kid?

29:46.931 --> 29:50.183
I don't know, guys.
His face, it seems familiar.

29:50.218 --> 29:52.051
You famous or something?

29:52.087 --> 29:55.054
You know we got licenses for this, kid?

29:55.090 --> 29:56.556
We're all above board.

29:56.591 --> 29:59.158
- Penguin gets his share.
- That's right.

29:59.205 --> 30:03.136
It's within our rights to
do anything we want to you.

30:03.465 --> 30:05.628
- Anything.
- (laughter)

30:11.041 --> 30:12.841
Look what you went and did.

30:13.434 --> 30:15.141
You've seen my stash.

30:15.566 --> 30:17.343
And you ticked off my boys.

30:19.681 --> 30:21.314
Now you got to die.

30:21.415 --> 30:23.969
Wait, wait, wait. I'm telling you,
I know this kid's face.

30:23.994 --> 30:25.794
Oh, would you shut the hell up.

30:25.893 --> 30:28.160
Hey, I'm telling you,
I've seen this dude.

30:28.289 --> 30:29.375
Don't matter.

30:29.591 --> 30:31.224
- No matter who he is...
- (gun cocks)

30:31.259 --> 30:33.211
...he's got to go.

30:34.929 --> 30:35.962
- (bones crack)
- (yells)

30:40.580 --> 30:42.480
(yells)

30:45.371 --> 30:47.769
Ah, get up.

30:47.909 --> 30:49.776
Hurry up, he's getting away.

30:59.837 --> 31:01.921
Think you're so slick, huh?

31:01.956 --> 31:02.989
(grunts)

31:04.592 --> 31:07.059
Now, I hate to tell you
I told you so, Master Bruce.

31:07.095 --> 31:09.156
Up you get.

31:10.039 --> 31:11.764
You got to leave.

31:21.764 --> 31:23.865
- She said she's sorry.
- TABITHA: She chose

31:23.900 --> 31:25.349
Nygma over me and Butch.

31:25.374 --> 31:27.828
So, Nygma's a Popsicle now.

31:27.930 --> 31:29.171
Let's give her a chance.

31:29.172 --> 31:31.266
- Why do you want this so bad?
- Because

31:31.291 --> 31:35.193
I'm sick and tired
of not being taken seriously.

31:35.378 --> 31:36.978
Of all those selfish guys out there

31:37.013 --> 31:38.546
who treat me like I'm stupid.

31:38.581 --> 31:41.021
Alone, I can't do much about it.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.577
With Barbara... maybe.

31:45.188 --> 31:46.988
But with you and Barbara?

31:48.006 --> 31:49.200
The three of us

31:49.225 --> 31:51.425
could give all those creeps
a run for their money.

31:51.461 --> 31:54.158
IVY: I want in.

31:57.079 --> 32:00.634
- Get out.
- No, no. Please, just hear me out.

32:00.822 --> 32:02.188
TABITHA: No.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.956
You're a Penguin stooge.

32:05.441 --> 32:07.667
What? I hate that freak.

32:07.722 --> 32:10.323
Oh, please. You guzzled down
his Kool-Aid. Beat it.

32:10.488 --> 32:12.682
No one takes me seriously, either.

32:12.870 --> 32:14.727
There's nothing
I wouldn't do to get back

32:14.752 --> 32:16.395
at the men who've treated me
like garbage.

32:17.289 --> 32:19.398
- Nothing.
- TABITHA: Not buying it.

32:19.434 --> 32:20.964
You're working for Penguin.

32:20.989 --> 32:23.402
Cool down, okay? I believe her.

32:24.004 --> 32:25.403
Thank you.

32:25.428 --> 32:26.827
Know what?

32:27.018 --> 32:28.918
You're rude.

32:30.500 --> 32:33.906
And you're about to get your
skinny ass kicked down the block.

32:33.992 --> 32:36.005
I won't ask again.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.474
Get out.

32:44.365 --> 32:45.598
(door closes)

32:46.913 --> 32:48.445
Get word to Barbara.

32:48.751 --> 32:50.417
I'll talk business.

32:52.728 --> 32:55.614
But I'll need something in return.

32:56.137 --> 32:59.450
- GORDON: Crane! Crane?
- CRANE: The demon is here.

32:59.475 --> 33:03.935
The demon who haunts
and tortures you is here.

33:04.005 --> 33:06.879
The one who poisoned your minds.

33:06.999 --> 33:12.151
Destroy him and free yourself
from his tyranny!

33:12.186 --> 33:13.719
(screaming and shouting)

33:22.558 --> 33:23.924
Kill him!

33:36.477 --> 33:39.111
Water, right.

33:39.147 --> 33:40.580
(woman screams)

33:42.984 --> 33:44.083
(man yells)

33:58.275 --> 33:59.274
Ah.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.892
I'm so happy.

34:02.055 --> 34:03.774
GORDON: Jonathan.

34:04.939 --> 34:06.505
(man growls)

34:17.774 --> 34:19.340
(yells)

34:25.426 --> 34:27.699
- You could have been killed!
- But I wasn't.

34:27.724 --> 34:29.402
That's 'cause I followed you.

34:29.427 --> 34:32.313
- I had it under control.
- How am I supposed to support you

34:32.339 --> 34:34.469
if you refuse to accept the
realities of the situation?

34:34.495 --> 34:36.335
- Alfred, the realities of the situation...
- (knocking on door)

34:38.097 --> 34:40.239
(knocking continues)

34:44.768 --> 34:46.668
Mr. Fox.

34:50.603 --> 34:53.376
- Bad time?
- No.

34:53.521 --> 34:55.321
Not at all.

34:55.536 --> 34:57.169
Please come in.

34:58.033 --> 34:59.735
Forgive me.

35:00.251 --> 35:01.984
I should have called, but...

35:02.800 --> 35:06.103
Well, I just couldn't stop
thinking about our last chat.

35:07.478 --> 35:10.495
Wayne Enterprises were
developing a durable material

35:10.520 --> 35:12.903
for military uniforms
when I worked there.

35:13.074 --> 35:15.841
(briefcase beeps)

35:16.850 --> 35:20.614
It is a thin Kevlar weave
with reinforced forearm protection.

35:20.748 --> 35:23.057
The gloves have a faceted grip design

35:23.082 --> 35:25.728
to help you cling to any surface.

35:26.089 --> 35:28.714
The whole uniform
is extremely lightweight,

35:28.956 --> 35:30.489
and actually, bulletproof

35:31.096 --> 35:33.448
to impacts from 10 feet or more.

35:34.260 --> 35:36.215
You know, for rock climbing.

35:37.074 --> 35:40.207
Oh, and long distance
radio communicators.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.702
In case you two wish
to talk to each other

35:42.727 --> 35:45.394
whilst climbing rock.

35:46.774 --> 35:50.309
Well, I will not keep you.

35:50.668 --> 35:54.254
I just didn't want to see you
get hurt again, Mr. Wayne.

35:56.050 --> 35:58.017
Thank you, Mr. Fox.

36:00.666 --> 36:02.843
I feel safer already.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.990
(door opens)

36:05.288 --> 36:08.928
Ladies. Thank you for returning.

36:08.963 --> 36:10.963
- I'm glad...
- Not so fast.

36:11.308 --> 36:13.833
I'll be needing proof of your sincerity.

36:14.269 --> 36:17.535
Yes. Selina said you would
need something from me.

36:17.672 --> 36:19.371
You can have anything you like.

36:19.407 --> 36:20.673
Fine.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.709
I'll take your hand.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.610
- My what?
- Both Butch and I

36:26.635 --> 36:29.815
lost a hand due to Penguin's
Machiavellian war games.

36:32.488 --> 36:34.345
I believe it's your turn.

36:34.455 --> 36:36.730
- You didn't say anything about this.
- Quiet.

36:36.755 --> 36:39.625
- Tabitha, I assure you...
- No more words.

36:39.660 --> 36:42.628
Penguin cut off Butch's hand,
Nygma mine.

36:43.882 --> 36:46.577
Now I take yours.

36:47.730 --> 36:49.678
Fine.

36:50.171 --> 36:53.773
If this is the only way
I can get you to trust me...

36:57.619 --> 36:59.513
...so be it.

37:24.119 --> 37:27.462
Fine. I'll trust you.

37:28.574 --> 37:30.204
For now.

37:32.619 --> 37:34.513
- I'll start Monday.
- (door opens)

37:36.551 --> 37:37.917
(exhales)

37:42.023 --> 37:43.355
(door closes)

37:53.380 --> 37:55.113
OSWALD: Where is he?

37:57.580 --> 37:59.680
We had a deal, Detective Gordon.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.887
That you would apprehend Jonathan Crane.

38:02.923 --> 38:05.991
You made a demand
in front of your cronies

38:06.085 --> 38:08.570
in an attempt to undermine me
and this department.

38:08.641 --> 38:10.508
There was no deal.

38:10.543 --> 38:12.613
I spoke for all of
the citizens of Gotham

38:12.638 --> 38:16.147
when I said that the GCPD
can no longer keep us safe.

38:17.075 --> 38:19.318
How many of you are sick

38:19.343 --> 38:23.694
of risking your lives every day
just to see criminals escape?

38:24.042 --> 38:27.380
How many times has this very
building become a war zone?

38:27.405 --> 38:28.826
MAN: What you say about that?

38:28.862 --> 38:31.062
OSWALD: I say it is time to start anew.

38:31.411 --> 38:35.032
To police ourselves.

38:35.068 --> 38:36.601
(camera clicks)

38:36.636 --> 38:38.620
I will triple the wage of any cop here

38:38.645 --> 38:40.199
who wants to work for me

38:40.224 --> 38:42.881
in insuring the safety
of this city's people.

38:42.942 --> 38:46.133
The future is now.

38:46.379 --> 38:48.742
Follow me into it.

38:49.836 --> 38:51.444
GORDON: Police yourselves.

38:51.469 --> 38:53.718
He just wants to pay you
to look the other way.

38:53.753 --> 38:56.254
Would you blame him if they did?

38:57.246 --> 38:59.846
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.621
This is a war, not one battle.

39:02.996 --> 39:05.930
If I would have went with
you, I would have lost them.

39:06.527 --> 39:08.584
And we need them to win this war.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.116
Now you don't have to say nothing,

39:11.653 --> 39:13.748
but I'm buying you a drink.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.849
- (door bell jingles)
- (squeaks)

39:28.254 --> 39:30.087
Oh, no. Not you.

39:30.123 --> 39:31.622
Leave.

39:31.658 --> 39:33.991
You never paid for
the last stuff I gave you.

39:34.431 --> 39:35.960
You make me smell perfume,

39:35.995 --> 39:38.341
make me giddy... cheap trick.

39:38.958 --> 39:40.765
Out! Out!

39:40.989 --> 39:42.834
I'm done with perfumes.

39:43.286 --> 39:45.169
I'm here for the good stuff.

39:46.156 --> 39:47.612
Don't know what you're talking about.

39:47.637 --> 39:49.112
Leave. I'm closing up.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.942
Word is you have potions here.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.580
Ancient, mystical potions
made by shamans all over the world.

39:56.348 --> 39:57.715
Who told you that?

39:57.750 --> 39:59.250
I'm done playing nice.

39:59.275 --> 40:01.152
I need a change, a big one.

40:01.187 --> 40:03.656
I need strength, power.

40:03.681 --> 40:06.557
- No.
- Where are they?

40:08.081 --> 40:09.345
My safe.

40:09.370 --> 40:10.595
Under the register.

40:10.630 --> 40:11.762
Combination?

40:11.798 --> 40:12.897
It's open.

40:15.768 --> 40:17.602
(groans)

40:18.397 --> 40:19.796
Which ones make me stronger?

40:19.821 --> 40:22.901
That's dangerous stuff.
It's too powerful for you.

40:22.926 --> 40:25.159
It can get in your blood, your DNA.

40:26.571 --> 40:28.337
Good.

40:30.049 --> 40:31.349
OWNER: No!

40:31.384 --> 40:32.717
Don't! No!

40:32.752 --> 40:34.886
- No! You must stop!
- (glass breaks)

40:38.358 --> 40:40.324
(groans)

40:40.360 --> 40:42.093
(panting)

40:53.709 --> 40:56.107
You let me walk into
that nightmare alone.

40:56.373 --> 40:57.909
Yeah, well, I figured it would take

40:57.944 --> 41:00.568
more than a couple of loonies
to take you out.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.191
Besides, I figured you
and me taking on Penguin

41:03.216 --> 41:05.137
and the entire criminal underground

41:05.162 --> 41:07.497
by ourselves wasn't the best idea.

41:07.789 --> 41:09.980
So what? You want to sit here,
do nothing, get drunk?

41:10.005 --> 41:12.263
- Is that your plan?
- Unless you got a better one.

41:13.942 --> 41:16.605
What makes you think
those cops back there were wrong?

41:17.422 --> 41:19.175
Are we really making a difference?

41:20.036 --> 41:22.308
One worth risking our lives over?

41:25.038 --> 41:27.939
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

41:29.358 --> 41:30.966
Makes me miss Falcone.

41:30.991 --> 41:32.353
I mean, I know he's a vicious bastard

41:32.378 --> 41:35.279
but he was, he was... fair.

41:35.663 --> 41:37.976
He ran the criminals of
this city with an iron fist.

41:38.001 --> 41:40.418
There was, th-there was,
there was honor.

41:43.996 --> 41:45.462
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

41:45.487 --> 41:46.924
Do not mess with Falcone.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.559
You killed his son, remember?

41:48.595 --> 41:51.018
Italians do not forget that crap.

41:51.043 --> 41:53.497
He must hate what Penguin's
doing as much as we do.

41:53.980 --> 41:56.867
You show your face to Falcone,
he will kill you.

41:57.981 --> 42:00.520
Yeah. Well...

42:01.530 --> 42:04.231
Like you said, we need an army.

42:04.704 --> 42:06.605
He's got one.

42:12.819 --> 42:14.752
(siren wailing in distance)

42:21.879 --> 42:24.292
ALFRED (in earpiece):
<i>Ooh, that's a lovely leap,</i>

42:24.316 --> 42:26.651
<i>Master Bruce; positively gazelle-like.</i>

42:26.676 --> 42:29.100
BRUCE: It's so lightweight, it's
like I'm wearing nothing at all.

42:30.003 --> 42:31.869
(grunts)

42:35.274 --> 42:36.774
(groans)

42:38.578 --> 42:41.178
ALFRED: Yeah, well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

42:41.572 --> 42:43.858
Remember to keep
your face covered at all times.

42:45.459 --> 42:47.859
<i>Try wearing that mask I made you.</i>

43:12.883 --> 43:17.883
