00:08.767 --> 00:12.133
- We are officially business
partners with Ken and Lisa.

00:12.133 --> 00:13.734
Whoo!
- Whoo!

00:17.700 --> 00:20.533
- What's your status with,
like, Brittany right now?

00:20.533 --> 00:22.400
- We've had sex more
since this happened

00:22.400 --> 00:24.033
than I have
in three months.

00:24.033 --> 00:25.767
I think she's
hate f---ing me.

00:25.767 --> 00:28.667
- Hate f--- is a horrible,
horrible feeling.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.166
- No, it's great!

00:30.166 --> 00:31.700
- Are you saying
I can come back

00:31.700 --> 00:34.300
and be a hostess
at your restaurant?

00:34.300 --> 00:36.367
- Yes, you can.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.333
- I was told
yesterday that

00:38.333 --> 00:42.166
you drunkenly made out with
a friend of Lala's.

00:42.166 --> 00:43.300
- So apparently
I got sloppy drunk

00:43.300 --> 00:44.600
and made out with someone,

00:44.600 --> 00:46.066
which I have
no recollection of.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.533
that he's trying to
take the heat off you.

01:18.533 --> 01:20.433
- Yeah, dude.

01:20.433 --> 01:22.066
- Apparently I got wasted
in Santa Monica

01:22.066 --> 01:23.367
and made out with
some chick.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.100
- Yeah.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.467
- Both you guys,
I would understand

01:26.467 --> 01:28.166
if you guys want to leave
'cause...

01:28.166 --> 01:30.767
- I'm not leaving.
- winter's coming.

01:30.767 --> 01:32.166
- Hey.

01:32.166 --> 01:33.600
- Hey, hello.
- Hey.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.433
- Hey, guys.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.233
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.767
- I don't recall requesting
your presence here.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.033
So scoot on
down the hall.

01:42.033 --> 01:45.600
- You're right, I'll be
out of the way. I'm sorry.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.467
- I'll get the door
for you.

01:47.467 --> 01:50.500
- Thank you.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.166
- Bye.
Oh, my God.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.467
- Bye.

01:54.467 --> 01:56.500
So I had a little
impulse purchase.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.166
It's a cooler
and it's motorized.

02:00.166 --> 02:02.233
So it gets me from my apartment
to Schwartz's apartment

02:02.233 --> 02:04.533
in, like, three seconds.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.000
And it's a quick getaway.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.266
- Hey, guys.

02:07.266 --> 02:08.734
- Schwartz, sit down, please.

02:08.734 --> 02:10.266
Just sit down,
because, you know what,

02:10.266 --> 02:11.667
we're all gonna
sit here together

02:11.667 --> 02:13.667
and we're gonna
get to the bottom of it.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.400
No one gets to light fires
and f---ing walk away anymore.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.266
- 'Cause that's f---ing not
f---ing fair.

02:17.266 --> 02:19.200
- No one did that. No one
lit a fire and walked away.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.734
- No, I don't want to do that.
I don't want to be that person.

02:20.734 --> 02:22.400
- This is ridiculous.
- I'm gonna go ahead

02:22.400 --> 02:24.133
and say right now,
this is the last time

02:24.133 --> 02:25.533
you get away with the whole
excuse of, like,

02:25.533 --> 02:27.266
I don't remember
because I was wasted.

02:27.266 --> 02:28.767
Guess what, if you want to be
married to me,

02:28.767 --> 02:30.500
you're not gonna be
wasted again in your life.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.667
- You're never gonna
tell me what I'm gonna do,

02:31.667 --> 02:32.767
what I'm not
gonna do ever.

02:32.767 --> 02:34.400
I mean, she's not my mom.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.734
I'm an adult.

02:35.734 --> 02:37.667
Even though I made
some poor decisions,

02:37.667 --> 02:41.533
I don't think it should cost me
my freedom, you know?

02:41.533 --> 02:44.367
- I'm telling you not to
f---ing get blackout drunk

02:44.367 --> 02:46.166
so you don't cheat on me again.
- Of course. Of course.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.667
- And you're telling me
I can't tell you

02:47.667 --> 02:49.266
that you can't
do that anymore.

02:49.266 --> 02:51.266
Excuse me.

02:51.266 --> 02:53.533
Tom, your f---ing--
your f---ing vows

02:53.533 --> 02:55.300
that everyone cried over.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.533
- As I stand here today
before my dream girl,

02:57.533 --> 02:59.500
my beautiful bride-to-be,
I can honestly say

02:59.500 --> 03:01.567
from the bottom of my heart
I have never loved you more

03:01.567 --> 03:03.700
than this moment right here.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.433
- Everyone was like,
oh, my God,

03:06.433 --> 03:08.233
how sweet, how cute,

03:08.233 --> 03:10.367
how this and that, like,
he really f---ing loves you.

03:10.367 --> 03:13.100
And I was like, I know. We've
been through hell and back.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.433
All that sh--'s
in our past.

03:15.433 --> 03:18.567
It's not, 'cause I let you go
and do your thing

03:18.567 --> 03:22.033
and I trust you, and I say,
have fun, Bub. Do your thing.

03:22.033 --> 03:24.533
I'm on a mom's trip
in New York

03:24.533 --> 03:28.333
and you're at the bungalow
making out with chicks.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.567
- Bubba, stop.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.667
I don't know you.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.333
I don't know you, 'cause you're
not the person I married.

- Good, thanks.

04:08.633 --> 04:09.767
Welcome back.

04:09.767 --> 04:12.233
- It's weird being back.

04:12.233 --> 04:14.300
- Do you remember
how this all works?

04:14.300 --> 04:16.500
- I mean, I say that I do
and then you'll probably

04:16.500 --> 04:19.633
see me looking very confused
and that's when you know that--

04:19.633 --> 04:21.333
- Take you off.
- Yeah.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.100
Help me.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.500
- Miss Kent.
- Hello, queen.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.066
- You're back.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.066
- Thank you for
having me back.

04:28.066 --> 04:30.467
- You've gotta be
consistent, though, okay?

04:30.467 --> 04:31.767
- I'm here.
- No messing about.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.233
- No messing about.

04:33.233 --> 04:34.633
I admire Lisa.

Most people would have
written me off

04:36.300 --> 04:39.066
after I burned
every bridge in town.

04:39.066 --> 04:40.767
I feel very much
indebted to her.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.767
- Now, don't be bloody
running away.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.066
- No.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.100
- 'Cause I'm not chasing.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.367
- I know.

04:46.367 --> 04:48.266
- All right.

04:50.767 --> 04:52.600
- Are you guys still
doing okay over here?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.600
Yeah?
All right, enjoy, guys.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.266
Hi.
- Hi.

04:56.266 --> 04:59.633
- One of my tables need
a strawberini.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.633
- I was just making that.

05:01.633 --> 05:03.233
- Is that what
you're really making?

05:03.233 --> 05:04.734
- I sure was.
- You have to make--

05:04.734 --> 05:05.767
put it in a martini glass
with the sugar around.

05:05.767 --> 05:07.533
- I know what I'm doing.

05:07.533 --> 05:09.533
I was wondering,
are you still

05:09.533 --> 05:11.533
up for...

05:11.533 --> 05:12.767
the housewarming party?

05:12.767 --> 05:14.633
Do you still
want to do it?

05:14.633 --> 05:16.734
- I don't want to make anybody,
like, super uncomfortable.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.467
- I think
it'll be okay.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.266
By having this
housewarming party

05:20.266 --> 05:22.367
and having all my friends
come over and drink my booze

05:22.367 --> 05:24.533
and eat my food, hopefully
it'll be harder for them

05:24.533 --> 05:26.533
to sit around and talk
sh-- about me all day.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.367
- I don't want you to be
around your friends

05:28.367 --> 05:29.533
and act like
you're not really trying to,

05:29.533 --> 05:31.033
like, do this for me.

05:31.033 --> 05:32.433
- Okay.

05:32.433 --> 05:35.133
- Like, you've gotta be
a new man.

05:35.133 --> 05:36.700
Okay?
- Okay.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.166
- Start with becoming
a faster bartender.

05:40.233 --> 05:42.300
I know it's a little weird to
have this housewarming party,

05:42.300 --> 05:45.033
but my goal is that
for one night

05:45.033 --> 05:47.633
we can just hang out,
have fun with our friends,

05:47.633 --> 05:50.767
and all the focus is finally
not on my relationship.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.367
♪ ♪

05:55.367 --> 05:57.166
- All right, darling,
thank you.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.300
Is Katie here or anybody?

05:59.300 --> 06:00.433
- Mm-hmm.

06:00.433 --> 06:03.533
- All right.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.500
- A few big parties
in the garden, so.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.667
- Okay.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.033
- Hey, ladies.

06:09.033 --> 06:12.033
- Well, work is crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

06:12.033 --> 06:13.600
- Can you break away
to chat?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.166
- Yeah. Do you care
if I just go real quick?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.734
- I'll hold down
the fort, guys.

06:16.734 --> 06:19.467
- I don't know why Lala
decided to tell everyone

06:19.467 --> 06:22.166
that Tom had made out
with this girl.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.400
- Lala.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.200
- 'Cause it was
a friend of hers.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.066
Like, I thought Lala and I
were cool finally.

06:30.066 --> 06:33.600
Last weekend when everything
was brought to my attention,

06:33.600 --> 06:35.200
and...
- Yeah.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.567
- I want to hear from you...
- Okay.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.133
- since--since
you are the one

06:38.133 --> 06:40.000
that said this to Ariana
and Scheana,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.467
and I've just been
kind of hearing it...

06:41.467 --> 06:42.734
- Right.
- like word of mouth

06:42.734 --> 06:44.200
telephone style,
like, why now?

06:44.200 --> 06:46.200
- So I've heard
from Scheana

06:46.200 --> 06:49.000
that you were making comments
about my relationship again.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.200
- Private jets kind of
make me scared.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.467
- Yeah.
- A little bit.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.300
Doesn't mean
I'll never go on one,

06:53.300 --> 06:55.367
but it'll be because
I chartered it

06:55.367 --> 06:57.767
and not someone's
sugar daddy.

06:57.767 --> 07:01.767
- I went back into this place
of, oh, my gosh,

07:01.767 --> 07:03.367
I feel like my dukes
are up again.

07:03.367 --> 07:06.734
- I can't argue
with that.

07:06.734 --> 07:09.066
I mean, it didn't
really occur to me,

07:09.066 --> 07:11.200
although it should have
because Scheana's your friend,

07:11.200 --> 07:13.200
that she would maybe come
and repeat that,

07:13.200 --> 07:16.166
but this makes sense why it's
being talked about just now.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.633
Why the f--- would
Scheana go to Lala

07:18.633 --> 07:21.500
and tell her that I was making
comments about her relationship

07:21.500 --> 07:23.600
when they were
clearly a joke?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.734
I just feel like Scheana's just
picking any opportunity

07:25.734 --> 07:28.734
to throw me under the bus
and turn Lala against me.

07:28.734 --> 07:30.367
I apologize for that.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.700
- Thank you.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.433
- I should not
have said that.

07:33.433 --> 07:35.266
- Do you want me to tell you
what she told me?

07:35.266 --> 07:37.633
- I mean, may--may as well
just have all the information

07:37.633 --> 07:39.600
for the sake of
moving forward.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.266
- So they were at bungalow
and she said,

07:41.266 --> 07:44.200
"Oh, my God,
Tom Schwartz is here."

07:44.200 --> 07:45.633
They made out.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.133
She did tell me that
through the night

07:48.133 --> 07:52.266
he kept accidentally
calling her Bubba.

07:52.266 --> 07:54.133
- Yikes.

07:54.133 --> 07:55.600
That's, like, our name
for each other.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.066
He has it tattooed
on his ass.

07:58.066 --> 08:00.000
- Tattooed your name
on my ass.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.333
- Oh, my God!

08:01.333 --> 08:03.100
- It's a sign
of commitment.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.133
- It's making my stomach turn.
It's just gross.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.100
Since we got married,
it's been like bliss,

08:08.100 --> 08:10.667
and so I'm like, why are you
giving me a reason

08:10.667 --> 08:12.400
to maybe not feel secure?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.233
- He needs to make

08:20.100 --> 08:23.767
- Anything else I can get
for you at the moment?

08:23.767 --> 08:25.166
- Do you need
another sangria?

08:25.166 --> 08:29.166
Are you still good?

08:29.166 --> 08:30.367
- Gentlemen.

08:57.433 --> 09:00.600

We can have
a little bit of...

09:04.033 --> 09:06.467
privacy in here.

09:06.467 --> 09:09.667
And so who's told you
all the details then, Katie?

09:09.667 --> 09:11.734
Has he told you
anything or--

09:11.734 --> 09:14.033
- He said, "I took a lot
of shots that day,

09:14.033 --> 09:15.700
and so, yeah, I blacked out.
I don't remember."

09:15.700 --> 09:18.000
- Well, that's a pretty
sorry state to be in.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.066
Let's be honest.
And you know what?

09:20.066 --> 09:21.734
That gives me
second thoughts as well.

09:21.734 --> 09:23.467
- And I--and I--
- Honestly,

09:23.467 --> 09:25.667
if I get involved with him
as a partner,

09:25.667 --> 09:27.600
that's like a marriage.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.200
And you might put up with his
bullsh--, but I'm not going to.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.133
- No.

09:32.133 --> 09:35.033
- I think if Schwartz doesn't
really straighten up

09:35.033 --> 09:37.734
and start taking
responsibility

09:37.734 --> 09:39.600
for his behavior,
then I don't see

09:39.600 --> 09:43.066
any relationship
that he has lasting.

09:43.066 --> 09:45.767
- I'm not leaving my husband or
divorcing over this dumb sh--,

09:45.767 --> 09:49.033
but my main thing is that
I don't want this

09:49.033 --> 09:53.233
to ruin this opportunity
he has with you and--

09:53.233 --> 09:55.333
- If I'm going to,
pardon the pun,

09:55.333 --> 09:56.734
be "getting into bed"
with him,

09:56.734 --> 09:59.567
I can't tolerate
that kind of behavior.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.100
That's too dangerous
for me.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.700
So I'm gonna talk to him,

10:02.700 --> 10:06.166
and he's got every reason
to be scared.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.367
Coming up...

Like, you know, his nose is
turned up to me, like--

11:40.533 --> 11:42.166
- That's because
I told him about you.

11:44.567 --> 11:47.600
So Jax invited me

11:47.600 --> 11:51.533

All right, friends, we're gonna
go ahead and start.

and we're gonna go ahead and mix
some of the brown and white.

we're gonna paint each other.

we all do busts of each other.

- To be honest, you guys,
I had this whole vision.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.367
I was gonna take us out to,
like, Joshua Tree

12:49.367 --> 12:51.433
or up in, like,
the canyons

12:51.433 --> 12:53.367
and, like, we were gonna have
like a Hunter S. Thompson day

12:53.367 --> 12:54.734
where we just get
utterly f---ed up.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.600

12:56.600 --> 12:58.367
a more mellow version.

12:58.367 --> 13:00.300

with Katie later

circumstances,

a little bit.

absinthe the other night?

I don't remember anything.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.734

16:32.734 --> 16:34.333

- The thing is about Lala,

16:34.333 --> 16:36.066
like I honestly
don't know her.

16:36.066 --> 16:38.266

that Scheana ran to her

16:38.266 --> 16:40.233
and said what I said.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.300
It felt like it was calculated.
I think she knew that

16:42.300 --> 16:45.433
would trigger Lala and she
knew Lala would blurt it out.

16:45.433 --> 16:47.367
- Well, I hope that's
not the case.

16:47.367 --> 16:49.033
- In that case, if Scheana--
maybe shouldn't be so concerned

16:49.033 --> 16:50.700
about my relationship,
because guess what?

16:50.700 --> 16:53.700
You and I have more in common
than you might think.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.400
Scheana, girl, you're not
that much different than me.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.433
I mean, we've all heard

17:04.133 --> 17:07.033
So let's just get it
all out there.

17:07.033 --> 17:10.133
It was the night of
the Vanderpump Dogs opening.

17:10.133 --> 17:12.567

Toca Madera first,

17:12.567 --> 17:15.166

at El Carmen after.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.233

saw him full on

17:17.233 --> 17:19.200

making out with this girl?

17:21.467 --> 17:22.734

your girlfriend?"

- Okay. I love that.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.033
- What do you think about
tomorrow night, then

25:17.033 --> 25:18.567
at Brittany's?
- It's weird to me.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.433
She's a bigger
person that I am.

25:20.433 --> 25:23.300
I want every woman to know
their f---ing worth.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.700
- Right, he knows,
he's like--

25:24.700 --> 25:27.033
he can just show
a little bit of progress

25:27.033 --> 25:28.533
and be back in
with her.

25:28.533 --> 25:31.100
- But then he sees that
that type of behavior

25:31.100 --> 25:33.033
is forgiven.
- Right.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.433
Like there--that there's really
no actual consequence.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.166
- Oh, that just put
a pit in my stomach.

25:36.166 --> 25:38.300
- I know.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.133
- I think it's f---ed up that
there's so many men out there

25:40.133 --> 25:42.066
who are in healthy,
happy homes

25:42.066 --> 25:44.467
and then they go out and f---
every Tom, Dick, and Harry

25:44.467 --> 25:46.266
and Tom's hairy dick.

25:46.266 --> 25:47.734
Dogs need to be put
in the doghouse.

25:47.734 --> 25:50.734
I'm just glad it's
someone else's drama.

25:50.734 --> 25:52.433
- Girl, let me tell you.

25:52.433 --> 25:55.333
How are you
and Mr. Thomas?

25:55.333 --> 25:58.200
- We're good. I mean,
I'm not so much like--

25:58.200 --> 26:00.433
I don't really crave, like,
a "P" in the "V" sitch...

26:00.433 --> 26:02.133
- Okay.
- pretty much ever.

26:02.133 --> 26:03.300
- Yeah.
- It kind of was like

26:03.300 --> 26:05.166
uncomfortable for my vagina.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.600
- So you just
give him blowies?

26:06.600 --> 26:09.133
- Uh, no.

26:11.033 --> 26:12.700
- No, I don't want anyone
touching my vagina, like,

26:12.700 --> 26:14.333
pretty much ever.

26:14.333 --> 26:15.600
- I'm shocked.
- I'm uncomfortable

26:15.600 --> 26:17.200
with my vagina.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.734
- How long has
that been, though,

26:18.734 --> 26:20.166
that it's been
like that?

26:20.166 --> 26:22.200
- I was in
a really, like,

26:22.200 --> 26:25.100
a mentally and emotionally
abusive relationship...

26:25.100 --> 26:26.467
- Yeah.
- where I was told that

26:26.467 --> 26:28.333
my vagina was disgusting.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.567
- And I had cellulite
and "Why do you wear that?"

26:30.567 --> 26:32.367
and "Why aren't you dressed
like this?"

26:32.367 --> 26:34.433
and "How come you don't look
like those girls?"

26:34.433 --> 26:37.200
Those things don't go away.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.200
I've always had these issues
with my self-esteem

26:40.200 --> 26:42.633
with my body, these
things from my past.

26:42.633 --> 26:44.467
And when Tom and I
first started dating,

26:44.467 --> 26:46.633
I think that the newness of it
was just so exciting

26:46.633 --> 26:48.767
I kind of just
didn't hear it

26:48.767 --> 26:50.500
in my own head.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.433
And then as the relationship
matured and grew,

26:53.433 --> 26:55.100
that real stuff
from my past

26:55.100 --> 26:57.300
has just developed into
this huge monster

26:57.300 --> 27:00.500
that now takes up
a big space in my head.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.066
- Well, I think
you're perfect.

27:03.066 --> 27:05.400
And it sounds cheesy,

27:05.400 --> 27:08.367
but I literally do this
every morning.

27:08.367 --> 27:10.133
I look in the mirror
and I literally talk to

27:10.133 --> 27:12.400
every part of my body,
and I'm like,

27:12.400 --> 27:14.200
"I love you."

27:14.200 --> 27:16.000
My mom taught me
at a very young age

27:16.000 --> 27:18.266
to be thankful for every
single part of your being.

27:18.266 --> 27:20.066
I don't love my feet,
but I thank them

27:20.066 --> 27:22.133
because they
walk me around.

27:22.133 --> 27:25.133
I thank my hands even though
I think they're man hands.

27:25.133 --> 27:26.400
They give great hand jobs.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.133
I thank my little
kitty cat

27:28.133 --> 27:30.133
because it takes that "D"
like a champ.

27:30.133 --> 27:32.533
So maybe just like
getting in that routine

27:32.533 --> 27:34.734
of, like,
"I'm a f---ing badass

27:34.734 --> 27:37.600
"and not one thing that
someone says to me

27:37.600 --> 27:39.266
is gonna make me
think otherwise."

27:39.266 --> 27:41.133
- Thank you.

27:41.133 --> 27:43.133
- You're welcome!
Thanks for sharing with me.

- I am invested in
your relationship...

29:05.200 --> 29:07.066
- I know, I know.
- I also have another reason

29:07.066 --> 29:10.500
to be overly concerned
about this situation...

29:10.500 --> 29:12.033
- Totally.
- Because a partnership

29:12.033 --> 29:13.433
is like a marriage...
- Yeah.

29:13.433 --> 29:15.367
- Where you treat
each other with respect.

29:15.367 --> 29:17.233
- Yeah.
- Like, when you're my partner

29:17.233 --> 29:18.700
and you've got the keys
and you're valet tonight...

29:18.700 --> 29:20.200
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna say,

29:20.200 --> 29:22.200
"You know what, Lisa,
I blacked out.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.567
"I banged the waitress, I don't
know where the money went,

29:23.567 --> 29:25.633
and I lost the keys"...
- Yeah.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.500
- "Because I blacked out," is
that what you're gonna tell me?

29:27.500 --> 29:29.333
- No, of course not.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.367
- I think it's time to
grow the f--- up, I really do.

29:31.367 --> 29:33.233
- I'm so sorry to even
put you in this position.

29:33.233 --> 29:34.600
I am taking this
very seriously, by the way.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.200
- You should take

- Of course.

29:38.367 --> 29:40.500
I do.

feelings, and I love you.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.734

30:05.734 --> 30:07.467
- The night of
the Vanderpump Dogs opening

30:07.467 --> 30:10.266
Rob kissed some chick.

30:10.266 --> 30:12.767
- This is bullsh--.

30:20.166 --> 30:20.467
- Pick your poison.

30:21.767 --> 30:23.734
- I love it.

30:23.734 --> 30:27.400
- Yeah, I've got all of
the alcohol here, mixers there,

30:27.400 --> 30:30.066
and then food's gonna be
over there with the plates.

30:30.066 --> 30:31.433
- Okay, I brought these, too,
in case you wanted to,

30:31.433 --> 30:33.266
like, label stuff.
- Yeah!

30:33.266 --> 30:35.000
I'm gonna put this one
by the Gummi Bears

30:35.000 --> 30:36.500
so people know
they're drunken.

30:36.500 --> 30:39.033
This party tonight was
Jax's idea,

30:39.033 --> 30:41.033
but all my girls
are coming.

30:41.033 --> 30:42.633
I know they have my back.

30:42.633 --> 30:45.000
So we're gonna get drunk,
we're gonna party,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.700
and most importantly, we have
our drunken jelly bears.

30:47.700 --> 30:50.100
- These are too big for me
to stick my tongue in.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.400
I don't have
a long tongue.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.433
Just a big mouth.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.266
- Mm, those are
really good.

30:59.266 --> 31:01.166
- Good.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.133
- We have to
talk to you.

31:03.133 --> 31:06.133
- I really do not want to
tell you this either.

31:06.133 --> 31:07.367
- I don't think--

31:07.367 --> 31:10.000
- It has to do with Rob.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.533
The night of
the Vanderpump Dogs opening...

31:12.533 --> 31:14.133
- Mm-hmm.
- When we all went

31:14.133 --> 31:15.667
to El Carmen after that...
- Mm-hmm.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.133
- So right before El Carmen,
he went to Toca Madera

31:18.133 --> 31:21.333
and he kissed some chick,
a hostess.

31:21.333 --> 31:23.000
And the hostess
literally pulled up--

31:23.000 --> 31:24.467
- No.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.166
I already know
this is bullsh--.

31:26.166 --> 31:27.533
- I know for a fact that
it actually happened.

31:27.533 --> 31:30.000
She showed him a photo
of the two of you

31:30.000 --> 31:31.400
and she goes, "Oh, well,
isn't this your girlfriend?"

31:31.400 --> 31:32.700
And he was like,
"Well, I mean,

31:32.700 --> 31:34.333
I don't know if
she's my girlfriend."

31:34.333 --> 31:36.133
- I just wanted you to
hear about it

31:36.133 --> 31:38.000
before other people started
trying to talk about it.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.533
- It's just funny timing.
Jax cheats, Schwartz cheats,

31:40.533 --> 31:42.133
and now it's like,
"Oh, Rob kissed a girl."

31:42.133 --> 31:43.467
It's f---ing bullsh--.

31:43.467 --> 31:46.133
I honestly don't believe
any of this.

31:46.133 --> 31:48.700
The funny part of this
is him and I

31:48.700 --> 31:51.100
don't even kiss a lot
because he isn't a kisser.

31:53.266 --> 31:55.033
- Yeah.
- He's just not.

31:55.033 --> 31:57.033
He's very affectionate
in every other way,

31:57.033 --> 31:58.767
but we don't
kiss a lot.

31:58.767 --> 32:02.166
So for him to walk in and kiss
someone is, like, laughable.

32:02.166 --> 32:03.767
Rob cheating is not in my brain.

32:03.767 --> 32:05.633
Oh, my God, what do I do?

32:05.633 --> 32:07.734
I'm melting down.
Aah!

32:11.500 --> 32:13.100
- Katie felt
attacked yesterday,

32:13.100 --> 32:14.767
this is why she
brought this up to me.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.333
Because you went to Lala

32:16.333 --> 32:18.233
to gossip about Katie
talking sh--

32:18.233 --> 32:20.200
about her "boyfriend"
or relationship or whatever.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.767
- Oh, my God,
I wasn't gossiping.

32:21.767 --> 32:23.767
First of all, Katie said
something about him...

32:23.767 --> 32:25.633
- They were f---ing kidding.
- And that's when I was like,

32:25.633 --> 32:28.066
okay, well, now I have
an obligation as Lala's friend

32:28.066 --> 32:31.300
to tell her that this is
being said about her boyfriend.

32:31.300 --> 32:34.633
I don't even think there are
words to describe

32:34.633 --> 32:38.100
the rage I'm feeling for
Katie doing this right now.

32:38.100 --> 32:40.133
I don't think there's a word
worse than

32:40.133 --> 32:41.367
to describe her.

32:41.367 --> 32:43.066
- You're doing that thing.

32:43.066 --> 32:44.600
You're doing that fake thing
right now.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.200
You're doing the thing, you're
fidgeting with your nails

32:46.200 --> 32:48.133
and you're going,
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm."

32:48.133 --> 32:49.734
- I just think it's
very convenient timing

32:49.734 --> 32:53.100
for a rumor about my
amazing boyfriend to start.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.133
I've known him for
almost 11 years...

32:55.133 --> 32:57.133
- I know that you have.
- and I know that

32:57.133 --> 32:58.600
he would never do that at
that stage in our relationship.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.133
- All I want you to
understand is that

33:00.133 --> 33:02.066
we were just trying
to have your back!

33:02.066 --> 33:03.667
- I appreciate that and thank
you and we dropped it.

Hi.

It's like the best gift ever!

33:28.367 --> 33:30.700

33:32.700 --> 33:34.300

inviting me.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.133

33:37.233 --> 33:39.166

33:39.166 --> 33:40.700
We're gonna make
a toilet paper cake.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.700

a piece of sh--.

33:42.700 --> 33:44.300
- Pretty much.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.700
- This is your gift.
- Thank you.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.433
- We got this
just for you.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.567
- You guys are like
the pink ladies.

33:49.567 --> 33:51.433
- We're on girls tour.

33:51.433 --> 33:53.767
- We're like, well, let's rep
the ladies just a little bit.

33:53.767 --> 33:55.667
So I'm just like
we'll just be girl squad.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.500
It's about
power of the pussy.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.166
Let's start taking shots
out of the bottle

33:59.166 --> 34:01.166

Thanks for coming over.

34:13.066 --> 34:14.667

- Thanks for coming.

34:16.700 --> 34:19.533
The only rule in my house is
that everybody has to be drunk.

34:19.533 --> 34:22.133
- Wait, you gotta
face them all forwards.

34:22.133 --> 34:24.400
- Bubby, I don't even know how
to do my hair anymore.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.200
Maybe I need
a more grown-up haircut.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.734
Yeah?

34:34.433 --> 34:36.066

34:36.066 --> 34:38.600
But I still like to get drunk.

- Tom, no more jokes.

34:40.200 --> 34:42.333
Are you almost ready?

always be together,

f---ing f---ed up.

41:44.033 --> 41:46.400
- F---. All right,
all right, let's do it.

41:52.033 --> 41:53.500
- Blackout party, aah!

41:53.500 --> 41:55.300
- Hey, hey, don't yell.
- Shh.

41:58.033 --> 42:00.700
- Finish your beer, man!

42:00.700 --> 42:02.100
- This is for--
this is for--

42:02.100 --> 42:03.533
- No, it's not, dude!

42:03.533 --> 42:06.033
You're a token
drinker beer!

42:06.033 --> 42:07.400
- That didn't
make sense.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.767
- Are you f---ing
kidding me?

42:08.767 --> 42:12.300
Everyone, everyone,
guess what.

42:12.300 --> 42:16.166
You're a piece of sh--.
You're a piece of f---ing sh--.

42:16.166 --> 42:19.367
I've heard the recordings.
You deserve to rot in hell.

42:19.367 --> 42:21.033
- Oh, my God.
- F--- you.

42:21.033 --> 42:23.300
Get the f--- out of here,
you piece of sh--.

42:26.066 --> 42:27.667
You deserve to
rot in hell.

42:27.667 --> 42:30.333
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:30.333 --> 42:32.166
- James Kennedy's
back, baby.

42:32.166 --> 42:34.000
We're gonna keep the party
going on all night.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.200
Make some noise!

42:35.200 --> 42:37.700
together: Whoo!

42:37.700 --> 42:39.567
- Yeah!

42:39.567 --> 42:41.467
- It's kind of gone
from bad to worse, has it?

42:41.467 --> 42:43.066
- Mm-hmm.
- So you want him gone.

42:43.066 --> 42:45.033
- Yeah.

42:45.033 --> 42:46.600
- Lala and Ariana were the ones
that brought up the recording.

42:49.266 --> 42:51.333
- Is that your
judgment, Ariana?

42:51.333 --> 42:52.600
- Just say no!

42:52.600 --> 42:54.700
- It's not on my phone!

42:54.700 --> 42:57.333
Keep having Jax's back,
you f---ing dick!

42:57.333 --> 42:59.300
- All I'm saying in
take f---ing responsibility

42:59.300 --> 43:00.734
for your f---ing actions!

43:00.734 --> 43:02.767
- I think we should just
break the f--- up.
