WEBVTT

02:03.791 --> 02:06.627
I told you to be on your way
half an hour ago, sir.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.092
There's no loitering here.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.139
What's your name, sir?

02:19.598 --> 02:20.808
What's your name, sir?

02:24.103 --> 02:25.437
Dougie Jones.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.066
And where do you live,
Mr. Jones?

02:34.446 --> 02:36.157
Home.

02:36.282 --> 02:37.908
And where is home?

02:45.166 --> 02:47.751
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch the badge.

02:48.294 --> 02:49.670
Lancelot.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.506
Lancelot Court?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.012
Red door.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.765
Have you been drinking, sir?

03:01.891 --> 03:03.475
Any drugs or medications?

03:03.601 --> 03:05.477
Have you taken anything?

03:09.982 --> 03:11.150
Case file.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.909
Come with me.

03:20.034 --> 03:20.868
Come on.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.719
Just a second.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.388
Dougie?

03:41.513 --> 03:43.057
Ma'am, do you know this man?

03:43.182 --> 03:44.308
Uh, yes, of course I do.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.352
He's my husband, Dougie Jones.

03:46.477 --> 03:47.728
Where have you been?

03:47.853 --> 03:50.481
He seems a little disoriented.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.483
That's on a good day.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.777
He has no identification,
and he wasn't able

03:54.902 --> 03:56.654
to give me the street address.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.781
He only knew the house
by the color of the door.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.867
Oh...thank you very much,

04:01.992 --> 04:03.535
Officers, for bringing him home.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.288
Come on, sweetheart.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.581
Let's get you in.

04:07.706 --> 04:08.707
Badge.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.668
Yes, that's my badge, sir, yeah.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.211
Yeah, he...

04:12.336 --> 04:13.837
He's got this thing
for my badge, I don't know...

04:13.963 --> 04:15.256
He likes...

04:15.381 --> 04:18.217
Thank you.
Thank you, Officer.

04:18.342 --> 04:19.176
Come on in.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.136
Uh, ma'am?

04:21.262 --> 04:22.596
There's an envelope
here for you.

04:22.721 --> 04:23.889
Oh.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.766
Thank you again.

04:25.891 --> 04:26.725
Good night.

04:26.850 --> 04:27.768
Good night, ma'am.

04:29.853 --> 04:32.273
Dougie, I'm sorry,
I forgot, your car.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.024
Where is your car?

04:35.693 --> 04:37.653
Have you eaten?

04:37.778 --> 04:40.364
Come on.
I'm gonna fix you a sandwich.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.843
Tomorrow lunchtime,
I'm taking you to see Dr. Ben.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.179
He needs to take
a good look at you.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.723
Look at you.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.435
And what are these?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.358
Case files.

05:23.866 --> 05:24.908
Case files.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.418
And this one...

05:37.880 --> 05:39.256
...there's nothing written
on it.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.597
Okay, Dougie,

05:46.722 --> 05:48.682
you need to go upstairs

05:48.807 --> 05:50.976
and say good night to Sonny Jim.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.853
He's been waiting up for you.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.357
Up for you.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.363
Go upstairs and say good night
to Sonny Jim.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.963
Upstairs!

06:26.220 --> 06:27.429
Dougie.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.363
I already brushed my teeth.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.454
Can I leave my cowboy light on?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.082
Will you stay with me
until I fall asleep?

08:21.251 --> 08:22.961
Asleep.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.155
Dad.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.744
Dad.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.302
Dougie!

09:12.427 --> 09:14.638
Get down here right now!

09:14.763 --> 09:16.473
<i>Right now!</i>

09:18.809 --> 09:21.270
Mom!
He was gonna stay with me!

09:21.395 --> 09:22.854
Not tonight, he isn't.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.982
<i>Mommy will be up soon, honey.</i>

09:27.192 --> 09:29.403
Get down here, right now!

09:35.158 --> 09:37.494
You are in the doghouse, mister.

09:37.619 --> 09:38.870
You were supposed to call them

09:38.996 --> 09:40.247
and set up a time
to pay them off,

09:40.372 --> 09:42.666
and look, this shows up!

09:42.791 --> 09:44.876
Do you have
an explanation for this?

09:45.002 --> 09:46.420
Jade.

09:47.838 --> 09:49.464
Jade?

09:49.590 --> 09:50.757
So that's her name, is it?

09:50.882 --> 09:52.634
Jade give two rides.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.470
I'll bet she did.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.600
And you admit you know her.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.688
Look at you two,
holding each other like that.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.322
Are you gonna answer that?

10:15.032 --> 10:17.034
Maybe it's Jade calling!

10:18.660 --> 10:20.454
Jade.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.623
Oh, my God, Dougie.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.125
We are not done with this.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.295
Hello?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.546
<i>Doug Jones.</i>

10:34.426 --> 10:36.553
Who is this?

10:36.678 --> 10:38.472
<i>Doug...Jones.</i>

10:41.808 --> 10:44.144
He's indisposed.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.604
<i>Did you get our envelope?</i>

10:45.729 --> 10:47.814
Yes, I did,
thank you very much.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.316
Now, you listen to me.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.485
How much does he owe you?

10:51.610 --> 10:52.736
<i>Did he tell you?</i>

10:52.861 --> 10:54.488
No, he didn't tell me.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.699
I'm just finding out
about all this right now.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.201
<i>Fifty thousand.</i>

10:59.326 --> 11:01.411
A‒and how's he
supposed to get that?

11:01.536 --> 11:03.830
Hmm? Who can get
that kind of money?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.374
And what if he
doesn't have it?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.793
What are you gonna do then?
Break his legs?

11:07.918 --> 11:10.420
Think about it; it's hard enough
to get that kind of money,

11:10.545 --> 11:12.798
let alone with broken legs.

11:12.923 --> 11:16.635
<i>Fifty thousand dollars,
past due.</i>

11:16.760 --> 11:19.054
<i>It'd be real smart
for Mr. Jones</i>

11:19.179 --> 11:22.140
<i>to have that on him tomorrow
when we call his office.</i>

11:22.265 --> 11:23.558
No, no, no, no.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.519
Don't you dare go to his office.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.437
I'll talk to you myself.

11:27.562 --> 11:31.191
In the park, at the corner
of Guinevere and Merlin

11:31.316 --> 11:32.401
by the mall.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.237
I'll be the one
carrying the red purse.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.905
Red purse.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.073
<i>When?</i>

11:38.198 --> 11:39.950
Noon-thirty tomorrow.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.965
What a mess you've made
of our lives, Dougie.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.344
Now, what am I
gonna do with you?

11:59.469 --> 12:01.346
I was gonna take you
to see Dr. Ben tomorrow

12:01.471 --> 12:02.889
during your lunch hour.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.643
And now I have to meet
your friends at 12:30.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.231
W-where's your car?
And your wallet?

12:11.356 --> 12:14.693
What happened to your wallet
and your identification?

12:14.818 --> 12:17.112
And if that's work,
you better get started right away.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.364
The last thing we need
is you losing your job, Dougie.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.746
Okay, now,

12:25.871 --> 12:29.249
I'm gonna go upstairs
and say good night to Sonny Jim.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.215
Tomorrow's a big day.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.717
Big day.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.054
- Oh, Dougie...
- Big day.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.348
Yes, sweetheart.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.159
You have a super night too, Gordon.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.370
I don't know when
I'm gonna get home.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.955
<i>Thank you, Albert.</i>

18:42.080 --> 18:43.748
<i>And let me remind you</i>

18:43.873 --> 18:45.834
<i>that this work
you are doing tonight</i>

18:45.959 --> 18:48.586
<i>is very, very important.</i>

18:48.711 --> 18:51.756
<i>And I will be thinking of you
as I drink this...</i>

18:51.881 --> 18:52.841
<i>Here you go.</i>

18:52.966 --> 18:54.134
<i>Thank you, sweetheart.</i>

18:54.259 --> 18:56.928
<i>...fine Bordeaux.</i>

18:57.053 --> 18:58.638
Yes, I love a night on the town

18:58.763 --> 19:01.099
when it's 34 degrees
and raining.

19:29.294 --> 19:32.172
Fuck Gene Kelly,
you motherfucker!

20:19.844 --> 20:20.678
Diane.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.486
Hello, Albert.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.976
Ah, shit.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.645
Ah.

21:17.652 --> 21:18.569
Whoa.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.992
That is...whoo!

21:25.285 --> 21:28.413
That's right, small time.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.290
You can, uh,

21:30.415 --> 21:32.834
you can pick the rest of it up
at Mary Ann's.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.169
How'd you know that name?

21:36.629 --> 21:37.547
You know the area?

21:40.341 --> 21:41.175
Mm‒

21:43.136 --> 21:45.471
Shit.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.348
Oh, that‒that stuff kicks.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.693
Have you ever studied your hand?

22:12.457 --> 22:13.666
What do you think?

22:15.335 --> 22:17.462
I've been all around here
last couple of weeks.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.589
I, uh...

22:23.259 --> 22:24.552
...I like it.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.307
We can‒
we can move the sparkle

22:29.432 --> 22:31.184
right down from Canada.

22:31.309 --> 22:32.310
Yeah.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.319
I got a problem with my liver.

22:47.367 --> 22:50.078
Hey, these fucking little towns,
they're a pushover, right?

22:50.203 --> 22:52.955
Law enforcement's
asleep at the wheel.

22:53.081 --> 22:55.833
Fuckin' sheriff here is, like,
90 years old or something.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.678
Did you ever see the movie
<i>The King and I</i>?

23:10.014 --> 23:11.015
What?

23:16.813 --> 23:18.648
I said I like it.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.527
What do you think?

23:30.410 --> 23:32.829
You, uh,

23:32.954 --> 23:34.664
you got this under control?

23:35.748 --> 23:36.916
Yeah.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.921
You better have.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.012
There's‒there's one problem.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.684
I don't know you yet.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.611
I'm gonna be watching you, kid.

24:05.736 --> 24:06.863
I'm watching you.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.531
Got that?

24:09.323 --> 24:10.575
Yeah.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.286
I got it.

24:13.411 --> 24:14.620
Don't call me "kid."

24:23.713 --> 24:25.256
Just‒

24:25.381 --> 24:29.469
just remember this,

24:29.594 --> 24:30.970
kid...

24:33.848 --> 24:37.351
...I will saw your head open

24:37.477 --> 24:39.562
and eat your brains

24:39.687 --> 24:41.939
if you fuck me over.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.363
You can count on that.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.087
This is you.

26:38.639 --> 26:39.890
This is me.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.022
Heads, I win.

26:49.483 --> 26:50.943
Tails, you lose.

27:03.331 --> 27:04.206
"Kid."

27:04.332 --> 27:06.125
Fuck you, man!

27:12.131 --> 27:13.591
Come on. Come on.

27:15.259 --> 27:17.428
Come on. Come on.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.978
- Morning, Bill.
- Morning.

27:27.813 --> 27:28.814
Hey, Carl!

27:30.816 --> 27:32.109
Yeah?

27:33.152 --> 27:35.237
Can I get a ride with you
into town?

27:35.363 --> 27:38.157
I-I gotta pick up
Linda's mail at the P.O.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.283
Sure, Mickey.

27:40.951 --> 27:41.827
Bill.

27:53.381 --> 27:56.509
Beautiful morning, huh?

28:09.730 --> 28:11.899
You, uh,

28:12.024 --> 28:15.194
you go into town about this time
every day, don't you?

28:15.319 --> 28:16.362
Damn near.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.406
How come?

28:18.531 --> 28:20.866
Gets me out of this trailer park.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.328
Not much I got
to look forward to

28:24.453 --> 28:26.622
at my age, Mickey,

28:26.747 --> 28:28.916
except the hammer slamming down.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.210
Don't say that, Carl.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.421
You know, you got
a lot of tread left.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.632
How's Linda?

28:36.757 --> 28:38.843
She's doing a lot better.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.803
Got the government agencies
to finally get

28:40.928 --> 28:44.014
one of them
electric wheelchairs.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.808
Fuckin' war.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.354
So the government's
taking care of you, huh?

28:50.479 --> 28:51.939
Not hardly.

28:52.064 --> 28:56.110
Took us about six months
to get this wheelchair for her.

28:56.235 --> 28:59.697
Fuckin' government.
Ha.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.789
Want a smoke?

29:08.914 --> 29:10.040
Yeah.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.626
Yeah, but I quit.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.255
Quit?

29:16.380 --> 29:17.256
Yeah.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.258
Quit about a year ago.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.139
I've been smoking
for 75 years,

29:25.264 --> 29:26.640
every fucking day.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.820
So when I pass that shop, I say,

29:39.945 --> 29:42.531
"Oh, I wonder if they have
a cupcake with my name on it."

29:42.656 --> 29:44.992
And when I go in,
sure enough, they have it.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.077
It's magic.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.706
And when I pass by
the Double R, I say,

29:50.831 --> 29:52.041
"Hmm, I wonder if they have

29:52.166 --> 29:53.793
a slice of cherry pie
with my name on it."

29:53.918 --> 29:56.420
And when I come in,
sure enough, you have it.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.672
Today you had two pieces of pie

29:58.798 --> 30:00.841
with my name on it,
each one.

30:02.051 --> 30:03.594
Well, Miriam, it turns out

30:03.719 --> 30:06.680
you're one of our best
pie customers ever.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.724
Because Norma
makes the best pies.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.351
- She sure does.
- Mm-hmm.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.728
Oh, hey, can I get
two cups of coffee to go?

30:12.853 --> 30:14.146
One decaf for me
and one regular

30:14.271 --> 30:16.315
for one of the moms
who loves Double R coffee?

30:16.440 --> 30:17.733
- Coming right up.
- Excellent.

30:17.858 --> 30:20.152
How is school, Miriam?

30:20.277 --> 30:23.364
Oh, the kids this year
are so cute.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.657
Aw.

30:28.702 --> 30:31.288
Okay, here you go.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.916
Keep the change.
The tip is for you all.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.543
Oh, thank you, Miriam.

30:35.668 --> 30:38.045
- Thank you, Miriam.
- Bye.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.343
She can't afford
to leave a tip like that.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.345
I know.
Poor thing.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.473
But she just loves our pies.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.308
You know what?
Next time, let's treat her.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.853
Oh, yeah, great.
Great idea.

30:57.273 --> 30:59.358
Stupid magic motherfucker.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.906
Ha, yeah, "kid"?

31:06.031 --> 31:07.867
I'll show you fucking kid.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.081
Whoo!

31:15.249 --> 31:16.208
Yeah!

31:58.918 --> 32:00.085
Got ya.

32:26.779 --> 32:27.988
Whoo!

32:35.996 --> 32:37.915
What the fuck?

32:38.040 --> 32:39.291
Fuck this.

32:58.143 --> 32:58.978
Hey!

32:59.812 --> 33:01.397
No!

33:03.649 --> 33:04.149
No!

33:13.909 --> 33:15.744
Oh, no.

33:15.869 --> 33:16.745
No.

33:16.870 --> 33:19.957
Oh, God.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.420
Hey!
Hey, I told you

33:24.545 --> 33:26.547
to get out of the fucking way!

34:04.418 --> 34:07.588
No.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.350
God.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.033
Oh, no.

37:08.477 --> 37:09.519
Greg!

37:09.645 --> 37:11.563
I found the plate.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.904
One-one-nine!

37:21.448 --> 37:22.908
One-one-nine!

37:24.534 --> 37:28.497
David, union, George, Edward,

37:28.622 --> 37:32.167
Lincoln, Victor.

37:32.292 --> 37:33.168
Copy?

37:33.293 --> 37:35.087
Got it.

39:39.336 --> 39:40.337
Dougie?

39:42.506 --> 39:44.091
Dougie.

39:46.551 --> 39:47.803
Dougie.

39:47.928 --> 39:49.805
Quit clowning around.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.433
Dougie‒

39:59.231 --> 40:00.232
Dougie.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.035
Dougie.

40:12.911 --> 40:13.829
Come on.

40:36.435 --> 40:37.436
Jones!

40:40.981 --> 40:41.982
Jones!

40:48.238 --> 40:50.115
Jones!

40:51.992 --> 40:53.285
Dougie!

40:54.578 --> 40:56.663
In my office!

40:56.788 --> 40:58.248
Now!

41:40.874 --> 41:42.375
Huh.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.481
What the hell

42:04.606 --> 42:07.400
are all these
childish scribbles?

42:07.526 --> 42:09.694
H-how am I gonna
make any sense out of this?

42:11.821 --> 42:13.573
Make...

42:13.698 --> 42:15.075
...sense of it.

42:16.576 --> 42:17.619
I'm thinking you may need

42:17.744 --> 42:20.163
some good
professional help, Dougie.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.877
Help Dougie.

44:33.713 --> 44:34.547
Dougie.

44:40.470 --> 44:41.763
Thank you.

44:45.141 --> 44:48.520
I want you to keep
this information to yourself.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.188
This is disturbing.

44:50.313 --> 44:52.565
To say the least.

44:52.691 --> 44:55.068
I'll take it from here.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.237
But I may need your help again.

45:00.073 --> 45:02.784
You've certainly given me
a lot to think about.

45:06.621 --> 45:07.872
Think about.

45:27.434 --> 45:29.853
Dougie?

45:29.978 --> 45:32.689
You're an‒
an interesting fellow.

46:00.550 --> 46:02.051
You Jones?

46:02.177 --> 46:03.845
Yes.
Now let's get to it.

46:03.970 --> 46:05.388
Explain to me exactly
what Dougie did

46:05.513 --> 46:07.140
to make him owe you money.

46:07.265 --> 46:08.641
He borrowed it.

46:08.767 --> 46:10.518
What do you mean,
"he borrowed it"?

46:10.643 --> 46:12.687
He took points
on a football game.

46:12.812 --> 46:14.606
He got greedy,
he doubled down.

46:14.731 --> 46:16.191
It didn't work out for him.

46:16.316 --> 46:18.234
Out 20 grand he was,
plus interest.

46:18.359 --> 46:20.195
Now, that was three weeks ago.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.863
Meter's still running.

46:21.988 --> 46:23.740
It's up to 52.

46:23.865 --> 46:26.034
So let me get this straight.
People were playing games.

46:26.159 --> 46:28.203
He made a bet
where he lost $20,000.

46:28.328 --> 46:31.748
But you want him
to pay you back $52,000?

46:31.873 --> 46:33.458
Very good.
That's correct.

46:33.583 --> 46:35.043
Okay, so you get this straight.

46:35.168 --> 46:37.045
My husband has a job;
he has a wife;

46:37.170 --> 46:39.172
he has a child;
he does not make enough money

46:39.297 --> 46:41.883
to pay back $52,000
for anything.

46:42.842 --> 46:44.135
We are not wealthy people.

46:44.260 --> 46:45.762
We drive cheap, terrible cars.

46:45.887 --> 46:47.263
We are the 99 percenters.

46:47.388 --> 46:48.681
And we are shit on enough.

46:48.807 --> 46:50.225
And we are certainly
not gonna be shit on

46:50.350 --> 46:51.309
by the likes of you.

46:51.434 --> 46:52.852
Nevertheless, lady‒

46:52.977 --> 46:54.729
So here's what we're gonna do.

46:54.854 --> 46:56.606
Without my knowledge,
my husband came to you

46:56.731 --> 46:58.233
for a loan of $20,000.

46:58.358 --> 46:59.901
You were nice enough
to give it to him.

47:00.026 --> 47:01.861
But he should never
have been gambling like that.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.029
I'm gonna pay you back.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.782
Now, at my bank, where we make
less than one percent interest

47:05.907 --> 47:07.700
on what little money we have,

47:07.826 --> 47:09.077
people would be
turning cartwheels

47:09.202 --> 47:11.704
just to get 25 percent interest
on any loan,

47:11.830 --> 47:14.332
and that is what I'm generously
gonna give to you right now,

47:14.457 --> 47:17.085
$25,000.

47:17.210 --> 47:20.129
That is my first, last,

47:20.255 --> 47:22.090
and only offer to you.

47:24.676 --> 47:26.511
What kind of world
are we living in

47:26.636 --> 47:27.971
where people
can behave like this?

47:28.096 --> 47:30.223
Treat other people this way
without any compassion

47:30.348 --> 47:32.517
or feeling for their suffering?

47:32.642 --> 47:34.894
We are living in a dark, dark age,

47:35.019 --> 47:36.646
and you

47:36.771 --> 47:38.565
are part of the problem.

47:38.690 --> 47:41.276
Now, I suggest you take
a good, long look at yourselves

47:41.401 --> 47:44.112
because I never want to see
either of you again.

47:58.001 --> 48:00.003
Tough dame.

48:00.128 --> 48:02.046
Tough.

48:03.464 --> 48:07.552
What do you mean he wasn't in the car?
Three bodies?

49:03.733 --> 49:04.859
Oh, no.

49:38.017 --> 49:39.185
Fuck!

52:06.749 --> 52:08.334
The hell?

52:08.459 --> 52:10.878
Use the ladies' room, Chad.

52:11.003 --> 52:12.713
The hell are you doing?

52:12.839 --> 52:13.923
Please, Chad,

52:14.048 --> 52:15.800
use another restroom.

52:18.761 --> 52:20.138
Clear this with the sheriff?

52:25.059 --> 52:26.727
I'll tell him if you don't.

52:27.979 --> 52:29.772
Yeah, you do that, Chad.

53:03.472 --> 53:05.308
Filling out paperwork's
no fun, fellas.

53:05.433 --> 53:08.561
I know that, but, uh,
gotta be done.

53:08.686 --> 53:09.562
And when you finish...

53:09.687 --> 53:11.230
That motherfucking
piece of shit.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.815
...I want you to handle that‒

53:12.940 --> 53:15.693
Well, surprise, surprise!

53:16.569 --> 53:18.863
It's not fixed!

53:18.988 --> 53:20.114
What's that, Doris?

53:20.239 --> 53:21.407
Dad's car.

53:21.532 --> 53:23.034
This morning, he went to drive,

53:23.159 --> 53:25.453
couldn't even get it
out of the driveway, Frank!

53:25.578 --> 53:27.705
It just lurched and lurched.

53:27.830 --> 53:30.666
Sounds like he
left the emergency brake on.

53:30.791 --> 53:33.252
Are you telling me my father
doesn't know how to drive a car?

53:33.377 --> 53:34.420
Is that what you're telling me?

53:34.545 --> 53:35.922
Don't you dare,

53:36.047 --> 53:38.257
don't you dare try
to blame my father

53:38.382 --> 53:39.842
for that car not running right!

53:39.967 --> 53:41.302
We'll get it looked at again

53:41.427 --> 53:42.428
if it'll make you feel better.

53:42.553 --> 53:45.181
Feel better?
Feel better?

53:45.306 --> 53:48.893
Why, why are you always
against me, Frank?

53:49.018 --> 53:50.770
Let's go to my office.

53:50.895 --> 53:53.564
They did a lousy job
fixing that car.

53:53.689 --> 53:55.107
They have to make it right,

53:55.233 --> 53:57.360
or we're not paying them
until they do!

53:57.485 --> 53:59.820
I sure wouldn't take
that kind of shit off her.

54:02.698 --> 54:04.033
What?

54:04.992 --> 54:07.870
You don't know
what you're talking about.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.914
Oh, yeah?
How's that?

54:12.166 --> 54:13.376
Forget it.

54:13.501 --> 54:14.794
What's the matter?

54:14.919 --> 54:17.046
It's a free world.

54:17.171 --> 54:18.464
I can voice my opinion.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.258
Oh, you sure can.

54:20.383 --> 54:22.301
Oh, brother.

54:22.426 --> 54:24.595
She didn't used to be
like this.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.014
You didn't know that their son
committed suicide?

54:27.139 --> 54:29.725
Yeah, I heard
something about that.

54:29.850 --> 54:33.020
He couldn't take
being a soldier.

54:43.781 --> 54:46.075
Sheriff's Department.
What's your emergency?

54:47.618 --> 54:51.163
Where's your location?
