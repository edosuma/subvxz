WEBVTT

00:17.600 --> 00:19.000
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:19.080 --> 00:23.320
These documents are proof
of a German base in the Soviet Union,

00:23.400 --> 00:27.040
where German pilots are trained to become
fighter pilots by German experts.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.400
What else do you need?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.520
<i>Witnesses, files, photographs.</i>

00:38.880 --> 00:40.880
There is something else which is odd.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.800
Both victims died
when they were on their way to see you or had already seen you, Mr. Rath.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.760
-I beg your pardon?
-Jänicke was found by your nephew.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.960
Why did you shoot Father Wilczek?

00:51.040 --> 00:52.520
With your service weapon, I take it?

00:52.600 --> 00:55.280
<i>Why else would you</i>
<i>have swapped the bullets?</i>

00:55.360 --> 00:57.440
And you shouldn't have used
Krajewski's weapon.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.440
But this way we have two bodies now.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.480
And all evidence points
towards a copper from Cologne.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.520
-Where was it?
-Wolter had it, at home.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.440
That's impossible.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.520
I can't read any of this,
it's all in shorthand.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.560
You have to translate this for me.
I want you to take it home

01:12.640 --> 01:13.880
<i>and take your time with it.</i>

01:15.160 --> 01:16.440
I can't stand by and watch.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.320
<i>Well, I think you need a schnapps.</i>

01:21.560 --> 01:23.720
-What are you doing?
-Go on, get in, doll.

02:20.960 --> 02:21.800
Hello?

04:13.160 --> 04:14.680
What are you doing? Stop that.

04:24.120 --> 04:24.960
Yes?

04:37.840 --> 04:39.320
What do you know about the gold?

04:42.520 --> 04:43.360
Gold?

04:49.760 --> 04:51.840
-What gold?
-The gold on the train.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.680
I... I know nothing about any gold.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.080
She knows. She was there.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.960
-What do you know about the gold?
-Nothing. I...

05:10.800 --> 05:11.640
Nothing.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.880
What do you know about the gold?

05:34.800 --> 05:35.920
Girl, talk.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.080
Talk to him. She knows, she was there.

05:38.920 --> 05:39.760
Nothing.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.280
So he's lying?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.280
No, wait! Wait. I...

05:44.960 --> 05:47.360
I know nothing about any gold at all.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.120
Please talk to him. You were there.
She was there.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.280
Good.

06:00.920 --> 06:01.800
So we'll wait.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.560
Let go of me, you bastard!

06:54.560 --> 06:58.360
IMPORT AUTHORIZATION

07:09.000 --> 07:10.800
Two, three planes.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.280
In addition to those in the hangars.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.920
Good, that's just the material we needed.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.160
We can instigate the proceedings.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.840
Very good work.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.240
Congratulations, gentlemen.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.160
Well, then.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.680
Let's get to work.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.840
DISTRICT COURT
CHARLOTTENBURG, BERLIN

07:30.920 --> 07:35.400
<i>We are hereby pressing charges</i>
<i>against the Reichwehr's general staff.</i>

07:35.480 --> 07:39.520
We have proof of the fact
that they have been building

07:39.600 --> 07:44.320
and arming an illegal aircraft fleet
for several years now.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.680
They are doing this with the support
of the Soviet Union's Red Army in Lipetsk.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.080
That's 300 km southeast of Moscow.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.960
Moreover, we're pressing
the charges for the following offense:

07:56.040 --> 07:59.680
In an engine shed in Berlin,
there is a freight train with 13 wagons,

07:59.760 --> 08:01.760
which was smuggled from the Soviet Union.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.960
The wagons contain
highly concentrated poison gas.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.680
What kind of gas is it?

08:08.200 --> 08:12.000
Phosgene, Your Honor, but this train
is just the tip of an iceberg.

08:12.240 --> 08:16.640
A modern German shadow army
is being built here on a large scale,

08:16.720 --> 08:21.240
bypassing the government, and knowingly
in breach of the Treaty of Versailles.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.240
Completely illegally.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.480
LIST OF DEFENDANTS

08:24.560 --> 08:28.640
The Black Reichswehr is the biggest threat
to peace in Europe since 1918.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.240
We must stop this threat
with total determination.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.280
These traitors jeopardize
the sovereignty of the German Reich.

08:36.360 --> 08:40.240
<i>In the military region of Berlin alone</i>
<i>there are 30,000 men in arms.</i>

08:40.320 --> 08:43.680
Major General Seegers? Major von Beck?
You are under arrest.

08:45.720 --> 08:49.120
<i>Everywhere in the capital</i>
<i>are hiding places with ammunition.</i>

08:49.840 --> 08:54.400
We have information that this organization
is preparing for a coup in the next days,

08:54.480 --> 08:57.280
maybe right this moment.
We must act immediately.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.000
Seems conclusive to me.

09:01.080 --> 09:01.920
ARREST WARRANT

09:02.000 --> 09:03.440
Your request is granted.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.840
PRUSSIAN DISTRICT COURT
MITTE, BERLIN

10:53.360 --> 10:54.800
Well, little Schmeling?

11:02.320 --> 11:03.800
Have the interrogations started?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.680
Listen, have you seen Miss Ritter today?

11:08.280 --> 11:09.440
-No.
-No.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.920
-That's impossible.
-Is it urgent?

11:12.560 --> 11:13.560
It certainly is.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.560
-Tell me at once when she comes in.
-Yes, sir.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.160
Let's go.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.840
Can you handle one of these?

11:57.520 --> 11:58.560
I'll show you.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.360
Take a couple of these.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.920
I'll handle this.

12:27.720 --> 12:28.640
<i>Major von Beck?</i>

12:31.640 --> 12:33.400
Your name, address, date of birth, rank.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.240
How dare you!

12:36.280 --> 12:37.120
Sit down.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.960
Name, address, date of birth, rank.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.520
Major von Beck.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.880
Von Beck, Anton.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.760
<i>I protest</i>

12:52.840 --> 12:55.600
against the arrest of my client.
It is in no way justif...

12:57.240 --> 12:58.800
Take a seat, General.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.200
-Which one is this, Mr. Wolter? An M-28?
-No.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.720
This is something very special.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.120
With this we will be writing history
tomorrow. Together with this one.

13:47.920 --> 13:48.920
Come with me.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.680
Quite an unusual
vacation destination, no?

14:05.240 --> 14:09.680
Since 1925, it's been 44 times
that you have spent a week in Lipetsk.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.560
That's almost one year.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.360
What have you been doing there?

14:18.680 --> 14:21.320
51, 52, 53, 54...

14:21.760 --> 14:27.640
56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64...

14:28.960 --> 14:32.600
72, 73, 74, 75.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.280
Seventy-five.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.080
Respect.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.600
You're quite a smash hit.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.360
The Chief of Police is...
You can't just...

15:15.720 --> 15:18.360
Mr. Wendt, what brings you here?
I don't...

15:19.760 --> 15:22.880
You still don't get
the ramifications of your actions.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.880
And the place
where you spent so much time

15:45.960 --> 15:48.520
just happens to be strewn
with German airplanes.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.640
The Ministry of the Reichswehr is
the right address for such questions.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.440
No, you are qualified to give exact
information about your whereabouts

15:57.520 --> 15:59.280
and the reasons for your trips there.

15:59.360 --> 16:03.240
This is about something that is bigger
than your career motives

16:03.320 --> 16:05.040
or my political convictions.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.320
Yes, it's about the foundation
of our constitution.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.520
A constitution which endangers the
existence of the nation is no protection.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.960
You illegally arm
the German fighter troops.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.200
The law protects the German citizens
from that.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.520
Why do you of all people believe

16:17.600 --> 16:20.880
it is your calling
to protect the citizen of this country?

16:21.520 --> 16:22.440
How do you mean?

16:23.040 --> 16:27.720
Please leave national matters
to the people on whose grounds you are.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.000
-And yours?
-Stonewalling.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.080
Any news about the notebook? I sent the officers to her home.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.320
The arrest warrant was adjusted.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.440
That was to be expected. By whom?

17:15.320 --> 17:16.880
The Reich's president's office.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.840
What does that mean?

17:19.240 --> 17:22.600
It means that I won't allow any more
questionings until tomorrow, 7 a.m.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.960
But why?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.040
The president of the Reich is abroad,

17:27.120 --> 17:31.800
and until Hindenburg approves
of the process, my hands are tied.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.080
You can't do this, Karl.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.600
It's up to you. We've been waiting
for this opportunity for years.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.240
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.560
You can continue tomorrow morning.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.320
The opponent is strong.

17:50.080 --> 17:50.920
And omnipresent.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.120
-And?
-Nowhere to be found.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.680
-Couldn't find her.
-I said that.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.120
Who?

18:19.920 --> 18:20.960
Hello?

19:17.240 --> 19:22.120
DETENTION CENTER
MOABIT, BERLIN

19:36.160 --> 19:38.920
Go on inside.
And make sure we're not interrupted.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.000
Unbelievable.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.800
Major General. The arms distribution
is completed. We are ready.

19:57.080 --> 19:57.920
Replenishment. Gentlemen.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.800
Even if circumstances
aren't very comfortable for us,

20:07.240 --> 20:10.200
we won't have a couple of Socialists
put a spoke in our wheel.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.080
So, let's get to work,
we have no time to lose.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.080
You have the security protocol
of the event?

20:23.840 --> 20:26.840
Well then. Operation Prangertag.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.320
Tomorrow, on June 2,

20:34.400 --> 20:37.760
the Foreign Ministers of Germany
and France meet in Berlin.

20:39.240 --> 20:44.240
On that night, the protocol includes a
visit of the so-called <i>Three Penny Opera</i>

20:44.320 --> 20:46.280
<i>at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm.</i>

20:47.360 --> 20:51.800
<i>Stresemann and the French Foreign</i>
<i>Minister Briand will arrive at 7:35 p.m.,</i>

20:51.880 --> 20:55.040
<i>coming from the southern end</i>
<i>of Friedrichstrasse.</i>

20:58.400 --> 21:02.440
<i>The two statesmen will be greeted</i>
<i>by the Lord Mayer of Berlin Gustav Böß</i>

21:02.520 --> 21:04.400
<i>outside the theatre at 7:45 p.m.</i>

21:06.440 --> 21:08.960
<i>There will be questions for the two</i>
<i>Nobel prize winners and photographs.</i>

21:11.960 --> 21:15.080
<i>There will be two checkpoints</i>
<i>for the task force.</i>

21:15.160 --> 21:17.800
<i>The first will be checking</i>
<i>the service cards.</i>

21:18.600 --> 21:20.480
As a special security measure,

21:20.560 --> 21:23.440
the second checkpoint
will issue all officers

21:23.520 --> 21:27.760
<i>who are on duty at the theater that night</i>
<i>with an identification tag.</i>

21:29.160 --> 21:32.840
<i>Without this tag it will be impossible</i>
<i>to enter the building.</i>

21:35.600 --> 21:38.960
<i>Next up is a brief welcome drink</i>
<i>at the foyer on the first floor.</i>

21:39.040 --> 21:42.080
<i>No representatives of the press</i>
<i>will be allowed.</i>

21:42.160 --> 21:46.280
Stresemann and his French guest
enter the hall to take their seats.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.600
<i>Five A and B,</i>
<i>in the Lord Mayor's VIP box.</i>

21:52.120 --> 21:54.040
<i>The time of the core event</i>

21:54.120 --> 21:57.000
will be between 8:20 p.m. and 8:25 p.m,

21:57.400 --> 22:00.440
depending on the form of the day
of the orchestra.

22:02.840 --> 22:06.480
<i>At the end of the first act,</i>
<i>there is a shootout on stage.</i>

22:07.840 --> 22:10.640
<i>Under cover of this noise,</i>
<i>we will strike.</i>

22:13.760 --> 22:15.720
<i>If the operation is successful,</i>

22:16.280 --> 22:20.400
<i>the republic's flag will be lowered,</i>
<i>well visible for all our scouts.</i>

22:29.680 --> 22:31.200
<i>The scouts will give our troops,</i>

22:31.280 --> 22:36.200
<i>waiting undercover in the ministries</i>
<i>and on the streets, the signal to start.</i>

22:38.080 --> 22:41.800
<i>The chief of the minister's office,</i>
<i>General von Schleicher, is in command</i>

22:41.880 --> 22:43.280
and triggers Prangertag,

22:43.360 --> 22:46.560
that is the mobilization
of military districts I and II

22:46.640 --> 22:50.200
and after that
of all barracks of the German Reich.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.040
Come on, move.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.200
<i>Our troops will take the Reichstag.</i>

22:55.320 --> 22:58.000
<i>Our troops will take police headquarters.</i>

22:59.200 --> 23:03.760
<i>Next up is the arrest of all democratic</i>
<i>key figures of politics and military,</i>

23:04.160 --> 23:07.680
<i>including Chief of Police</i>
<i>Karl-Friedrich Zörgiebel.</i>

23:07.760 --> 23:08.520
Come with us.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.240
<i>As the head of the supreme command</i>
<i>of the troops</i>

23:13.320 --> 23:17.400
I, accompanied by Major Beck,
will head to the House of Broadcasting

23:17.480 --> 23:19.280
where the new Chancellor of the Reich,

23:19.360 --> 23:23.320
General Ludendorff,
will announce the end of the republic

23:23.400 --> 23:26.840
<i>and the reintroduction of the monarchy.</i>

23:28.560 --> 23:30.080
<i>As soon as Berlin is secured,</i>

23:30.560 --> 23:34.200
<i>His Majesty the Emperor</i>
<i>will return from exile</i>

23:34.280 --> 23:37.880
<i>and will address his beloved people.</i>

23:41.560 --> 23:46.560
With God's help we will then,
under His Majesty's guiding hand,

23:47.560 --> 23:51.320
become the victorious nation
we've always been destined to be.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.440
Gentlemen...

23:56.160 --> 23:59.560
This is a decisive turning point
in German history.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.720
Long live Ludendorff.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.640
Long live Ludendorff!

24:05.720 --> 24:07.080
Long live the Emperor.

-No, don't do that.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.600
-Why?
-Gretchen.

25:26.800 --> 25:27.960
We were ratted out.

25:28.760 --> 25:29.600
What?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.080
By whom?

25:33.960 --> 25:35.720
Crap. Floppy hats.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.880
Let go of me!

25:38.960 --> 25:40.520
-Are you bored?
-What are you after?

25:40.600 --> 25:41.560
-Let me go.
-Fritz!

25:41.640 --> 25:43.560
Don't grab me, let me pass!

25:43.640 --> 25:44.960
-Stop.
-Gretchen, run!

25:45.040 --> 25:46.280
-Run!
-Stop!

25:49.160 --> 25:50.360
Fritz! No!

25:50.440 --> 25:51.960
They shot him!

25:52.200 --> 25:54.880
They shot him! Fritz!

25:55.080 --> 25:56.680
-They shot him!
-What's going on?

25:56.800 --> 25:58.440
Stand back! Police!

25:58.520 --> 26:01.240
-Not another step!
-Bastards! Murderers!

26:01.960 --> 26:03.680
-No!
-Come on now.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.440
Fritz!

26:26.600 --> 26:28.320
-Where is she?
-What?

26:28.400 --> 26:29.240
Where is Charlotte?

26:29.320 --> 26:31.640
What makes you think
I know where the girl is?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.240
I'm warning you!

27:31.480 --> 27:32.840
-Go on, get up.
-No, no.

27:33.800 --> 27:34.640
Come on.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.120
What do you know about the gold?

27:55.160 --> 27:56.440
Where?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.040
What do you know
about the gold on the train?

28:04.880 --> 28:05.840
Gold on the train?

28:06.560 --> 28:08.960
Girl, you're repeating my words
instead of answering.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.440
I don't know anything. I don't know anything.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.120
I don't know anything!

28:27.200 --> 28:29.640
Please don't! Not into the cold again!

28:29.720 --> 28:31.880
Please don't! I don't know anything...

28:34.720 --> 28:36.480
-No!
-Careful.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.800
No! No!

30:13.720 --> 30:15.120

Charlotte!

31:25.520 --> 31:26.600
Mimi, have you seen Lotte?

31:26.920 --> 31:29.640
Bruno, are you nuts?
You can't just barge in here.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.600
What's going on, gentlemen?

31:32.040 --> 31:34.960
I'm sorry, angel,
but we're looking for the little one.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.960
-You mean Lotte?
-Yes, her.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.920
Right! Thanks for nothing,
she stood me up today.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.280
-When was the last time she was working?
-Two days ago.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.960
Or has one of you seen Lotte since?

31:46.520 --> 31:47.520
No.

31:48.240 --> 31:52.400
What's up, Bruno?
There are other girls here. Right?

31:52.480 --> 31:55.000
No, I've had enough for today.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.360
I'm done.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.720
I'm afraid I have another appointment.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.520
But I'll leave you the car.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.800
Mrs. Sorokina?
Have you got a minute for me?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.280
Berlin police, Inspector Rath.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.800
What do you want to know?

34:44.640 --> 34:46.560
You don't know who I am.

34:49.040 --> 34:49.880
No.

34:50.640 --> 34:51.600
You don't.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.080
My father was a factory owner in Russia.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.000
When the revolution came,

34:59.880 --> 35:03.120
he exchanged everything he had for gold.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.920
And that gold...

35:06.200 --> 35:07.760
He hid it well.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.160
In a railway wagon.

35:12.160 --> 35:15.120
As children, we used to play in it,

35:15.680 --> 35:17.240
my brothers and I,

35:17.920 --> 35:21.040
with Tanya, the daughter of our chauffeur.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.240
That murderer.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.720
He betrayed us to the Bolsheviks.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.600
He had my family killed...

35:32.640 --> 35:35.240
and snatched all the gold.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.800
Then he disappeared in the turmoil of war.

35:42.960 --> 35:45.320
But Kardakov tracked him down.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.560
And he brought the wagon to Berlin.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.000
But there is no gold in those wagons.

35:53.880 --> 35:54.720
No?

36:16.600 --> 36:20.440
The Shadow Army of the German Reich,
<i>by Samuel Katelbach.</i>

36:23.160 --> 36:28.680
<i>"Has the Reichswehr been illegally</i>
<i>rebuilding the German air force?"</i>

36:41.400 --> 36:42.240
Mrs. Behnke?

36:47.360 --> 36:50.240
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

36:50.480 --> 36:51.920
I want to see Katelbach. Is he in?

36:54.560 --> 36:55.400
Come in. Thanks.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.120
Mr. Katelbach.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.720
What's the matter with you?

37:38.400 --> 37:39.240
Nothing.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.840
Thank you. No problem.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.160
What are you doing here?

37:46.560 --> 37:48.040
I read your article.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.880
On the Black Reichswehr.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.600
Are you with the political police now?

37:54.640 --> 37:58.240
Yesterday, a group of thugs made mincemeat
of the editorial office.

37:58.320 --> 38:01.440
They took whatever
Neanderthals think is important.

38:01.760 --> 38:06.320
Including a list of the private addresses
of all staff. Thank you.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.240
Who's your informer?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.800
It must be one of the staff of command.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.840
Someone from the inner circle.
Your article is jam-packed with detail.

38:33.920 --> 38:38.280
It's unlikely I would tell someone
from the political police my sources.

38:46.680 --> 38:51.080
Mr. Katelbach, I'm about to be forced
to release 15 high-ranking officers

38:51.160 --> 38:54.280
of this so-called Black Reichswehr
from custody.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.280
Even though we have
overwhelming evidence against them.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.120
What's the case?

39:00.400 --> 39:03.160
Procurement of internationally outlawed
weapons of mass destruction.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.160
Who's your target?

39:09.600 --> 39:10.440
Major Beck...

39:12.120 --> 39:14.880
Freiligrath, von Bock, Erhardt, Escherich.

39:16.080 --> 39:16.920
Seegers.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.080
Do you know what you are doing?

39:25.160 --> 39:27.400
You're messing with the state itself.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.280
I'm aware of that.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.320
Gereon,

39:35.680 --> 39:37.480
whatever you do, make it public.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.160
Only the public can protect you.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.640
The whole apparatus,
what you know as Black Reichswehr,

39:43.720 --> 39:46.520
those people are not fussy.
A thousand murders in five years.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.720
Murders of informants, journalists,

39:48.800 --> 39:51.400
sudden deaths of people entrusted
with confidential information.

39:51.480 --> 39:54.280
Only a handful of the killers were taken
to court, and all of them acquitted.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.800
I need backup.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.920
And you know someone
who may be able to provide that.

40:13.680 --> 40:14.520
Yes?

40:16.120 --> 40:17.600
Would any earlier be possible?

40:19.120 --> 40:20.800
Yes, fine. Fine, thank you.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.560
Where?

40:23.720 --> 40:25.480
On the corner of Fugger in half an hour.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.680
But only if I'm there.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.160
Alright, I'll get myself ready.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.560
Half a spoonful of sugar.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.440
I'd love one. Let's go.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.000
Thank you.

41:29.880 --> 41:33.320
Tell Bruno to get in touch some time,
please.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.200
I will. See you soon.

41:57.120 --> 41:59.160
-Mr. Rath!
-Taxi!

41:59.520 --> 42:01.640
I found this under your bed.

42:03.360 --> 42:06.040
-Come on now, Mr. Rath.
-Thank you.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.400
Watch where you're going!
Don't you have eyes?

42:39.800 --> 42:42.120
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

42:43.440 --> 42:45.320

43:01.840 --> 43:03.520

43:05.320 --> 43:07.320

43:08.880 --> 43:10.440

43:10.920 --> 43:14.040
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

43:14.440 --> 43:17.000
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

43:18.200 --> 43:20.640
<i>But not yet now</i>

43:22.400 --> 43:25.480

43:37.440 --> 43:40.680
