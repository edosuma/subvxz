WEBVTT

00:56.623 --> 00:58.792
I'll take that. Thank you.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.761
Where I grew up,
Louisiana, Cedar Grove,

01:01.861 --> 01:04.697
tennis was not
a game peoples played.

01:04.764 --> 01:06.933
We was too busy
running from the Klan.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.102
But here it is.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.638
When I'm interested
in a thing, I learn it.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.106
How it works,

01:13.206 --> 01:14.908
how the best peoples
in the world do it.

01:14.974 --> 01:17.777
And that's what I did
with tennis, with the girls.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.813
If you
look at the biggest servers,

01:19.913 --> 01:21.915
Sampras, Lendl, Connors,

01:21.981 --> 01:25.118
you'll see the break of
their wrist is like a smack,

01:25.218 --> 01:26.586
like a high-five.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.922
That's what you're looking for
when you hit it.

01:28.988 --> 01:30.290
That "pop".

01:30.390 --> 01:33.326
All we need is a club
for training,

01:33.426 --> 01:34.994
and clinics, the whole deal.

01:35.095 --> 01:39.332
Everything the girls need
to go from prodigy to pro.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.502
I wrote me a 78-page plan
for their whole career

01:42.602 --> 01:44.070
before they was even born.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.808
It was, uh, 1977, I had
watched this tennis match

01:48.908 --> 01:51.344
and I seen them get this girl,
uh, Virginia Ruzici,

01:51.444 --> 01:53.746
$40,000 for four days' work.

01:53.813 --> 01:57.083
And since I knew I had
only made $52,000 all year,

01:57.150 --> 01:59.285
I knew I was
in the wrong business.

01:59.352 --> 02:01.187
Went home that night,
told the wife,

02:01.287 --> 02:04.190
"We need to make
two more kids."

02:04.290 --> 02:05.959
So that night
I wrote up the plan.

02:06.025 --> 02:08.361
One for Venus, one for Serena.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.096
-All right.
-Cover their whole tennis...

02:10.163 --> 02:12.532
-Step in a little bit more.
-...cover their education,

02:12.632 --> 02:14.767
foreign languages, everything.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.669
-And now that plan say...
-All right, short it up.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.805
...it's time for us
to come see you

02:18.872 --> 02:20.974
to help turn them
into champions.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.610
Now, I know what you thinking.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.845
"This family
is from the ghetto.

02:25.945 --> 02:28.047
How they gonna pay old me?"

02:28.148 --> 02:29.349
Well, don't you worry
about that.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.617
We're not here to rob ya.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.352
We here to make you rich.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.554
You ever think
about basketball?

02:36.823 --> 02:38.291
Best of luck to you.

02:38.358 --> 02:40.527
Okay, you making a mistake,
but I'mma let you make it.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.061
-All right.
- Okay.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.731
-Them pants look expensive.
-Oh, they are.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.633
If I had a dollar
for every crazy parent

02:46.699 --> 02:49.202
that told me their kid
would make it to number one,

02:49.302 --> 02:50.737
I'd be a rich man.

02:52.038 --> 02:54.073
You look pretty rich to me.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.475
Well, there you go.

02:58.044 --> 03:00.213
You need to open
your stance up a little more.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.681
Your stance too closed.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.339
Serena, those books
are bigger than you are.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.341
No, they're not. I can do it.
I can carry more than you.

03:28.408 --> 03:29.776
And break your back
while you're at it?

03:29.876 --> 03:30.777
Wanna bet?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.712
-Serena!
-

03:34.013 --> 03:35.114
Oh.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.349

03:49.896 --> 03:51.965
Hey.
-Told ya I'd win.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.701
-Hi, Mrs. Strickland.
-Thank you.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.035
Now, you need
to go tell your father

03:56.102 --> 03:58.137
to stop working you so hard.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.773
I seen y'all practicing
in the rain.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.809
The man is crazy.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.546

back in the house.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.481
Tell your sisters

04:08.581 --> 04:09.916
Okay.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.485
We'll deliver
the rest of them books later.

04:12.585 --> 04:16.222
I ain't gonna tell you again,
do not talk to them kids.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.659
Excuse me.
They came onto my lawn.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.495
And somebody has gotta,
as hard as you're working 'em.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.163
They work as hard
as they need to

04:24.264 --> 04:26.466
to stay off these streets.

04:26.566 --> 04:29.636
I'm in the champion-raising
business.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.571
I got a book about it
about to come out soon.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.906
Maybe I give a copy
to your daughter.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.742

04:35.808 --> 04:37.010

Yeah, just stop talking
to my kids.

04:39.912 --> 04:40.947
Got your little
booty-hugging shorts.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.348
You need some bigger shorts.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.349
You know
she just wanna rile you up.

Get these girls to practice.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.794
-All right. Have a good day.
-You, too.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.998
Keep turning those hips
if you wanna get that power.

04:59.098 --> 05:00.533
Okay.
- Bye, Mom.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.035
-Tunde, dang, you're a nerd.
-Stop.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.703
Why you doing homework
on a Saturday?

05:03.803 --> 05:05.872
Because I am trying
to get an A.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.774
You should try it
with your B-Plus.

05:09.175 --> 05:10.943
Where are we practicing today,
Daddy?

05:11.010 --> 05:12.512
Yeah,

05:12.612 --> 05:13.880
At the club.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.848
And, Serena, stop saying
everything Venus say.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.318
Hope they don't steal
our balls again.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.552
Lyn, you probably
told 'em to do it

05:19.652 --> 05:21.187
so we wouldn't
have to practice.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.023
We got us

05:24.123 --> 05:25.325
And you don't need

-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, Mom.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.748
Hey, Mommy.

11:55.848 --> 11:57.083
Dinner's ready.
How was practice?

11:57.183 --> 12:00.186
-It was good.
-Daddy got beat up again.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.721
Did you work
on your serve?

12:01.787 --> 12:03.189
Yeah.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.191
Tunde, get the plates.

12:05.257 --> 12:06.792
If we eat fast enough,

12:06.892 --> 12:08.461
we'll probably have time
for the talent show.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.129
Oh, wait, hold on.
I'm going first.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.263
I already know
what I'm singing.

12:11.363 --> 12:12.631
Let me guess...

12:19.572 --> 12:22.608
Stop! What's so funny?
The song is a great song.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.710
-Move, move, move.
-Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

12:24.777 --> 12:25.978
Leave Serena alone.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.080
-Here, give this out.
-Thank you, Mama.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.415
Y'all go wash up.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.924
What happened?

12:38.991 --> 12:41.927
That same boy
sniffing around Tunde.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.766
-Gimme this.
-Thank you.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.735
All right.
I got to get to work.

12:51.570 --> 12:52.772
Okay, girls, half hour.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.441
Finish your homework,
then get to bed.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.776
-Y'all clean up.
- You got it?

12:56.842 --> 12:58.277
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mm-hmm.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.847
Something has to change.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.950
-What you mean?
-We can't keep up this pace.

13:06.352 --> 13:10.456
Me nursing all day,
you working all night.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.824
Coaching in-between.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.192
Now look at your face.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.861
Look, I done already
put this behind me.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.596
Okay, we just got to stick
to the plan.

13:17.663 --> 13:19.932
We got champions
in the other room.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.535
Richard, we have done
a great job with them.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.103
They are great,

13:24.170 --> 13:26.672
but they're not going
to Wimbledon like this.

13:26.772 --> 13:30.176
Not with hitting with you and
me on those raggedy courts.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.711
They need
better surfaces that...

13:32.812 --> 13:34.380
They need better everything.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.483
And not playing with you
with your busted-up feet.

13:38.284 --> 13:41.854
My feets are fine, okay?

13:41.954 --> 13:43.722
Okay, actually
they was hurting out there

13:43.823 --> 13:45.224
a little bit today.

13:48.527 --> 13:51.730
Richard, you playing.
I'm serious.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.567
I'm serious.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.412
-You are right.
-I know I'm right.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.646
Yeah.

14:09.248 --> 14:12.585
You should have seen Venus
out there today.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.588
Just something done clicked
in her mind.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.990
-She is so ready.
-Yeah, she really is.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.758
She ready for that next level.

14:22.862 --> 14:27.766
-She ready.
-You got to trust me, okay?

14:27.867 --> 14:31.604
-All right.
-I'mma get us some help.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.441
Venus and Serena
gonna shake up this world.

14:37.443 --> 14:38.777
And they gonna need to

14:38.878 --> 14:40.679
'cause they not gonna
make it as singers.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.349
They not 'cause...

14:46.785 --> 14:49.088
I got to get to work.
I got to get to work.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.625
-That's what I wanna hear.
-Mm-hmm.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.563
Don't you wanna dance

14:57.630 --> 14:59.131
We're gonna
shake up this world.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.068
With somebody

15:06.972 --> 15:08.874
-A basketball.
-Dancing together. A hole...

15:08.941 --> 15:11.310
-Ballet.
-Oh, a ring. A ring.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.745
A basketball hoop.

15:12.811 --> 15:14.380
Ten o'clock, girls.
Time for bed.

15:14.446 --> 15:15.881
What was it?

15:15.948 --> 15:17.249
Saturn.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.955
All right.
Y'all wrote in your journals?

15:23.055 --> 15:24.423
Made your plans for tomorrow?

15:24.490 --> 15:26.392
Yes, Daddy.
-That's right.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.627
Got to have a plan
for every day, else what?

15:28.727 --> 15:30.663
You fail to plan,
you plan to fail.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.398
That's right.
We not failing, are we?

15:32.464 --> 15:33.432
No, Daddy.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.267
Okay, all the way to the top.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.569
Come on, Meka.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.972
You know,
one day not too long from now,

15:40.072 --> 15:44.243
somebody gonna hand you girls
a check for $1 million.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.246
And you gonna buy
as many beds as you want.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.647
In one check? Really?

15:48.747 --> 15:51.150
Maybe even a couple of 'em.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.953
But we not gonna be
like this forever, okay?

15:56.121 --> 15:58.424
-Okay.
- All right.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.927
-You girls go to bed.
- Good night, Daddy.

16:13.472 --> 16:18.510
Down to the east

16:41.533 --> 16:44.636
Needs protection

16:49.408 --> 16:53.045
Must fall

16:57.016 --> 17:02.087
I see my reflection

17:05.691 --> 17:10.729
Inside these walls

17:22.841 --> 17:26.879
Down to the east

17:54.907 --> 17:56.308
As you notice, Vic,

17:56.408 --> 17:58.077
they have very good form.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.545
And, uh, you can see

17:59.611 --> 18:03.482
their serve looks very good,
hopefully.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.818
Raise your hand, Serena.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.453
Venus Williams.

18:09.555 --> 18:13.125
And, uh, we have your tape,
Tennis Our Way,

18:13.225 --> 18:14.760
and we've been viewing it.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.130
However, the tape say
you'll be good by Friday.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.500
Well, guess what, Vic,
we got good by Tuesday.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.168
-That's how good your tape is.
-

18:24.636 --> 18:25.938
These girls is looking
for some coaching,

18:26.004 --> 18:27.473
and we think you'd be great.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.175
So, you want to relax,
take it easy,

18:30.275 --> 18:34.279
and get a chance to see
some real good tennis players.

18:34.346 --> 18:35.981
-That's it.
-

18:36.081 --> 18:37.683
So I guess
you made that yourself.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.585
Yes, I did. Yes.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.086
Uh, when the girls
was younger,

18:41.153 --> 18:43.021
I had bought me
this camcorder.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.823
So I film myself in the mirror

18:44.923 --> 18:46.625
asking questions, things,
and the such.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.128
Then when they got older,
I start doing it with them.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.597
I called it
their "media training".

18:51.663 --> 18:54.166
I see.
Well, that's very industrious.

18:54.266 --> 18:57.369
Oh, yeah,
I'm a businessman, Vic.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.038
This deal you're asking for,
you know,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.341
all of this for free, Richard,

19:03.675 --> 19:06.011
nobody's taking that bet.

19:06.111 --> 19:08.380
Tennis is a technical game,

19:08.480 --> 19:09.948
you know,
probably one of the most.

19:10.015 --> 19:14.987
And... And if you didn't
grow up with the game, then...

19:15.053 --> 19:16.555
It's like playing the violin.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.124
You know, it takes hours
and hours a day.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.059
You know, year after year

19:21.160 --> 19:23.395
of expensive
expert instruction,

19:23.495 --> 19:25.898
just to hold the thing right.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.466
Yeah, and even then,

19:27.533 --> 19:30.802
even for families with
unlimited financial resources,

19:30.869 --> 19:34.239
the chances
of achieving the kind of

19:34.339 --> 19:38.410
mastery and success
that you're talking about...

19:38.510 --> 19:41.346
I mean, for one kid,
let alone two, it's...

19:42.581 --> 19:44.216
It's like asking somebody
to believe that

19:44.316 --> 19:46.385
you got the next two Mozarts

19:46.485 --> 19:49.421
living in your house,
you know?

19:49.521 --> 19:50.822
It's just...

19:50.889 --> 19:54.193
It's just very, very unlikely.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.564
I'm sorry,
that's just my two cents.

19:58.664 --> 20:01.700
-Yep. Yep.
-I, uh...

20:01.767 --> 20:04.937
-Maybe you can prove me wrong.
-Okay.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.673
-

20:13.245 --> 20:14.279
Daddy?

20:22.187 --> 20:25.057
Dear Heavenly Father,
Jehovah, God,

20:25.123 --> 20:27.125
we thank you for this food.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.962
We ask you to bless
the hands of the peoples

20:30.062 --> 20:31.930
that prepared this food.

20:32.030 --> 20:35.067
We thank you for
this opportunity as a family

20:35.133 --> 20:36.602
to come together.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.238
And we ask you to please,

20:39.304 --> 20:43.141
please don't let nobody get
fat from eating all this food.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.311
In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.580
Amen.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.584
Meka,
I think he was talking to you.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.821
Oh!
-

20:55.921 --> 20:57.889
-Look at all this cheese.
- What'd you get, Isha?

20:57.956 --> 21:00.559
I got a little bit of work
I got to do. Uh...

21:00.626 --> 21:03.095
Y'all ride home
with your mother. All right?

21:03.161 --> 21:04.596
Everything okay?
You all right?

21:04.663 --> 21:06.732
Oh, everything's great.
Y'all just go and eat.

21:06.798 --> 21:08.900
Bring... Bring my food home
when you come.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.237
Bye, Daddy.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.840
All right.
-

21:14.940 --> 21:16.742
You eating his food?
- Mm-hmm.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.606
Hey, where Tunde at,
homie?

21:47.673 --> 21:49.007
Roc,

21:49.107 --> 21:50.676
Come on.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.277
Did I stutter, nigga?

21:52.344 --> 21:54.112
Hey, let's roll, homie.
Fool just went right now.

21:54.179 --> 21:55.213
We bounce, we can smoke 'em.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.449
Leave this old-ass dude alone.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.219
You know
what my daddy taught me?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.457
How to smoke a blunt.

22:06.558 --> 22:09.227
And how to smoke
a bitch nigga, too.

22:11.296 --> 22:13.365
I'm real good at both.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.639
What you scared for, homie?

22:21.506 --> 22:22.841
Tell Tunde,

22:22.908 --> 22:25.177
me and the homies
might come by later

22:25.243 --> 22:27.746
and run a train on her.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.182
- Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

22:30.248 --> 22:32.050
Get his ass! Get his ass!

22:41.760 --> 22:43.729
Get the fuck

22:45.731 --> 22:47.499
Smoke him, homie.

22:47.566 --> 22:50.769
On the turf, homie. Smoke him.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.238
He came and disrespect you
in our hood.

22:54.706 --> 22:58.043
Don't nobody give a damn
about you, homeboy.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.179
Nobody.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.557
Let's roll. Let's roll.

23:12.624 --> 23:14.092
Take your balls, nigga.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.191

24:54.459 --> 24:55.727
They got Roc!

24:55.827 --> 24:56.795
Roc!
Hey, call an ambulance, nigga!

24:56.862 --> 24:58.163
Call an ambulance!

24:58.230 --> 24:59.464
Roc!

24:59.531 --> 25:00.465
Come on, Roc,
wake up! Talk to me!

25:01.666 --> 25:02.968
Get up, man.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.242
- Come on, let's go!

26:02.694 --> 26:05.063
Give me this. Give me this.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.544
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.479
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:41.232 --> 26:43.435
How many fingers
am I holding up?

26:45.270 --> 26:47.839
How you get all nine fingers
on one hand?

26:52.110 --> 26:53.812
You fine.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.148
Gonna take a shower.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.527
by Dolly Parton
playing on stereo]

27:09.628 --> 27:11.429
Where are we practicing
today, Daddy?

27:11.496 --> 27:13.365
Yeah, where are we
practicing today?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.500
Oh, we going
someplace special today.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.602
These houses are huge.

27:17.669 --> 27:20.171
Yes. That one
looks like a castle.

27:20.271 --> 27:21.439
Y'all like these houses?

27:21.506 --> 27:22.674
Yes.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.342
That one looks
like the White House.

27:24.442 --> 27:26.444
Which one? Which one you like?
What's your favorite?

27:26.511 --> 27:27.979
I like that one.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.781
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah,
that one's nice.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.216
If that was my house,

27:31.316 --> 27:33.385
I'd put a pool in the front
and a slide on the roof.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.786
You'd put your pool
in the front?

27:34.853 --> 27:36.221
-Have a big pool party.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.889
Everybody's gonna want
to come to my house.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.057
Oh, you just gonna be
the crazy lady on the block.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.291
No. I'm gonna be

27:40.358 --> 27:41.893
the coolest person
on the block.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.395
That one
has a tennis court.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.729
Oh, that's the one then.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.197
-That's the one.
- Yeah.

27:46.297 --> 27:49.067
You gonna have any one
of these houses you want.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.902
Beverly Hills,
Hollywood Hills,

27:51.002 --> 27:52.904
any of these old hills.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.140
'Cause you got a plan
and you gonna stick to it.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.309
When I was a little boy,
my mom used to say,

27:58.376 --> 28:02.080
"Son, the most strongest,
the most powerful,

28:02.180 --> 28:05.150
the most dangerous creature
on this whole Earth

28:05.216 --> 28:08.019
is a woman
who knows how to think.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.256
Ain't nothing she can't do."

28:11.356 --> 28:12.557
Y'all know how to think?

28:12.657 --> 28:13.858
Yes, Daddy.

28:13.925 --> 28:15.427
Now, these peoples
we about to go see,

28:15.527 --> 28:17.162
you gonna show them
how dangerous you are?

28:17.228 --> 28:18.496
Yes, Daddy.

28:18.563 --> 28:20.265
Lemme see
your dangerous face.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.667
-That's your dangerous face?

28:22.734 --> 28:24.102
-There you are. There you go.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.370
That's your dangerous face.

28:25.437 --> 28:26.705
Okay, don't do that
for the peoples.

28:26.771 --> 28:28.106
-Don't do that.
-Don't do that.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.887
-Hey.
-That's a nice shirt.

28:42.954 --> 28:44.756
Top o' the morning to ya.

28:54.566 --> 28:58.203
Look at that.
Look at that. Come on.

29:01.372 --> 29:02.941
Do you see who that is?

29:03.041 --> 29:04.242
Yes.
-Who's that?

29:04.309 --> 29:06.978
-John McEnroe?
-That's right. Who that?

29:07.078 --> 29:09.080
-That's Pete Sampras.
- Mm-hmm.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.549
One day,
they gonna be bragging

29:11.616 --> 29:13.952
about the time
they met the two of you.

29:16.654 --> 29:18.723
-What are you doing, Johnny?
-What?

29:18.790 --> 29:21.426
You know he's a smoker.
Get off your heels.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.995
Oh, screw you.
- Screw me?

29:24.095 --> 29:25.497
Okay, let's take a break.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.999
Why are you guessing early?
Just read the toss.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.634
It looked like
it was going outside.

29:29.734 --> 29:31.336
It did not.
- You see what he did?

29:31.436 --> 29:32.637
Yeah, but that's what

29:32.737 --> 29:34.139
you've been working
so hard for...

29:34.239 --> 29:35.940
-Excuse me, Mr. Cohen?
-...getting that shot...

29:36.007 --> 29:37.275
Yeah?

29:37.342 --> 29:40.078
Uh, Richard Williams.
We spoke on the phone.

29:40.145 --> 29:41.412
Oh, yeah. I remember.

29:41.479 --> 29:43.014
-The brochure.
-Yep, that's right.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.415
I actually brought you
another one

29:44.482 --> 29:45.917
in case you misplaced
the first one.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.186
No, no, no. I got it.
What can I do for ya?

29:48.286 --> 29:50.855
Well, we figured you was busy.
That's why we came to see you.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.357
Yeah.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.958
Everybody says I got these two
great tennis players,

29:54.025 --> 29:55.693
and we're still looking
for a coach.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.162
-Oh, yeah, Mr. Wilson, listen.
-No, it's Williams. Williams.

29:57.262 --> 29:58.429
We're in the middle
of practice here.

29:58.496 --> 29:59.697
This my daughter,
this is Venus.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.865
This is my other daughter,
Serena.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.534
Nice to meet you, girls.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.035
It won't take but a minute
to watch them hit a few balls.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.370
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I'm not taking any juniors

30:05.470 --> 30:06.971
right now,
and we're in the middle

30:07.038 --> 30:08.373
-of a very serious practice.
-Well, I don't mean

30:08.473 --> 30:09.541
to interrupt nothing.
Uh, Mac, Pete.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.775
Oh, tough break at Wimbledon.

30:10.842 --> 30:12.043
I see what happened
to you, Mac.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.044
Uh, you...
You gonna win again.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.379
Just keep your head up.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.780
Mr. Williams,

30:15.847 --> 30:17.048
-this is not a good time.
-Wait. Listen. Look...

30:17.148 --> 30:18.449
All right?

30:18.516 --> 30:19.484
-We're in the middle of...
-I just want you to

30:19.551 --> 30:20.685
watch them hit a few.

30:20.785 --> 30:21.953
Look, Mac is gone.
Mac is gone.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.054
The way Pete
whipping up on him,

30:23.154 --> 30:24.556
he may never come back.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.224
Look, Pete, you don't mind

30:26.324 --> 30:27.959
if he just watch 'em
hit a few balls, do you?

30:28.026 --> 30:29.394
It's okay with me.

30:29.494 --> 30:32.730
See? Come on. Mac is gone.
Pete's okay. We ready.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.399
You the only person
got a problem with this.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.501
Come on.
Watch 'em hit a few balls.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.069
You girls
are pretty good, huh?

30:38.169 --> 30:39.337
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.406
Oh, they better than good.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.175
-All right. A few balls.
-A few balls. That's...

30:44.242 --> 30:45.643
-Come on, come on.
- Come on, girls.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.745
Show him this magic.
Show him this magic.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.416
Hey, that's
their brochure, Pete.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.750
Now you take a look at that.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.152
I'mma have them sign it
for you later.

30:54.219 --> 30:55.753
-Come on, come on.
-Got it.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.855
So tell me your names again.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.323
-I'm Venus.
-I'm Serena.

30:58.389 --> 30:59.691
Venus and Serena. I'm Paul.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.359
Oh, yeah,
no, no, you not Paul.

31:01.426 --> 31:02.493
You Mr. Cohen.

31:03.261 --> 31:04.662
Mr. Cohen, right.

31:04.729 --> 31:06.397
All right, Serena, why
don't you start at forehand?

31:06.497 --> 31:07.732
Venus, backhand.

31:07.832 --> 31:09.534
We'll hit some down the line,
all right?

31:09.601 --> 31:10.602
That's good, Paul. That's how
I usually start with 'em too.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.669
That's real smart.

31:11.736 --> 31:14.239
Good.
All right, ready?

31:26.284 --> 31:28.720
That's right.
Show him the magic.

31:28.786 --> 31:31.122
There you go.
Good power, Venus Williams.

31:32.290 --> 31:33.558
That's it.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.628
What you think, Pete?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.029
They look good.

31:38.096 --> 31:41.065
They good. I know they good.
I know they good.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.802
Pete Sampras
is looking at you.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.739
Pete Sampras
gonna steal your stuff.

31:48.773 --> 31:51.276
All right, great job, girls.

31:51.376 --> 31:52.810
So, Serena, why don't
you go get some water?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.146
I wanna hit with your sister
for a minute.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.548
Venus, you wanna try something
a little different?

31:57.615 --> 31:59.250
Okay, so start in the middle.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.753
I want you to go after
every single ball, all right?

32:01.819 --> 32:03.121
I'm not gonna tell you
where they're coming.

32:03.221 --> 32:04.455
But don't stop
until we're done.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.891
Oh, she do that.
She'll do that.

32:09.894 --> 32:11.462
There you go.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.898
Yeah, I want
you to recover each time.

32:19.003 --> 32:21.005
Get it.
Show it to him.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.141
You have to
show him that magic.

32:27.979 --> 32:32.350
Yes. There you go.
There you go.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.019
Get it. All right.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.654
Okay.

32:36.754 --> 32:38.790
Girls, come here
and talk to me for a second.

32:38.856 --> 32:40.825
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.195
Lemme ask
you both something.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.798
What do you want out of this?

32:46.864 --> 32:50.268
I know what your dad wants,
but what about you?

32:50.335 --> 32:51.536
Well, I wanna win Wimbledon

32:51.636 --> 32:53.705
as many times
as anyone's ever won it.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.840
You think you can do that?

32:55.940 --> 32:57.375
I know I can.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.044
What about you?

33:00.144 --> 33:02.280
Who on the tour
do you wanna play like?

33:04.882 --> 33:07.785
Well, I'd like other people
to want to play like me.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.055
I bet they will.

33:11.155 --> 33:14.158
All right,
you girls go pick 'em up.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.865
Come on, Paul, let's go.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.836
You taught 'em all this?

33:24.902 --> 33:26.404
Oh, yeah,
me and my wife, Brandy.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.306
We both athletes.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.809
So, what you think?

33:34.512 --> 33:36.814
-Is this a bee you're drawing?
-Yes, it is.

33:36.881 --> 33:38.082
You're not working on...

33:38.182 --> 33:39.851
I thought y'all
were doing homework.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.760
We got a coach.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.733
- You little fakers.

33:55.833 --> 33:57.201
You little fakers!

33:59.037 --> 34:01.906
-Pete Sampras's coach?
- Mm-hmm.

34:02.006 --> 34:03.074
Sure as hell.

34:03.174 --> 34:05.243
So he's gonna do it for free?

34:05.343 --> 34:06.277
Um...

34:06.377 --> 34:08.946
He said he can't
do two for free.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.415
What?

34:10.515 --> 34:11.916
He only gonna teach Venus.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.385
Okay, okay,
you should have seen Venus.

34:14.452 --> 34:15.686
Pete Sampras was there

34:15.753 --> 34:17.054
and I don't think
he could beat her at all.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.189
Sampras? Okay, Venus!

34:18.256 --> 34:19.690
We were so good.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.292
Did you tell Serena?

34:21.392 --> 34:22.760
I know.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.595
And then, we only
hit the net, like, twice.

34:24.695 --> 34:26.097
Do you want to?

34:26.197 --> 34:27.565
Oh, Richard.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.967
We got
a coach. We got a coach.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.135
We got a coach.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.437
We got a coach.
We got a coach.

34:38.609 --> 34:42.480
It's not fair.
I wanna go with you.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.882
I know.
I want you to, too.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.253
Meka, Daddy said he's gonna
record everything,

34:49.320 --> 34:50.922
and then we can
watch it together.

34:50.988 --> 34:53.391
He has a plan, okay?

34:53.458 --> 34:54.959
Yeah, for you.

34:55.059 --> 34:57.662
Okay, Meka, your mom ready.
Y'all gonna practice today.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.298
But, Daddy,
I can't practice on her court.

35:00.398 --> 35:01.766
She always hits slices.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.602
That ain't nothing
but a few minor adjustments.

35:04.669 --> 35:05.903
You got to stay prepared

35:05.970 --> 35:08.906
for whatever's unpredictable.
Okay?

35:08.973 --> 35:11.242
Come on now,
give your daddy a kiss.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.744
Don't put no mean on my face.
Come on.

35:13.811 --> 35:17.281
Daddy love you.
Come on, Junior, let's go.

35:24.355 --> 35:28.593
I know you feel left out.
But you're not left out.

35:30.761 --> 35:32.630
You got something great, too.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.999
-What?
-Me!

35:36.134 --> 35:38.002
Come on, we got work to do.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.538
-Right now?
-Yeah, right now.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.707
I ain't raised no poop butts.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.376
-Mom...
-Come on. We got work to do.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.378
- Go. That's it.

35:47.478 --> 35:50.047
Back. Centre. And back.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.549
What you're going through

35:51.649 --> 35:53.551
is the Paul Cohen first-strike
strategic tennis system.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.553
It's gonna turn you
into a killer.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.321
You're gonna learn to think
about this tennis court

35:57.388 --> 36:00.791
as a chessboard
made up of 228 shots.

36:00.858 --> 36:02.560
You will learn
to perfect them all.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.029
Did I say stop?
Go, go, go. Again.

36:05.129 --> 36:06.797
-Centre.

36:06.864 --> 36:10.968
Come on! Up, up, up!
Explode! Side!

36:12.670 --> 36:14.906
Up, up, up! Back!

36:15.006 --> 36:19.210
Side, side, side. I need
you to be faster, Serena.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.312
- 24...

36:23.014 --> 36:24.749
25... Oh, halfway there.
Come on.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.151
26...

36:28.519 --> 36:31.322
Oh! Come on, back to
the middle each time.

36:31.389 --> 36:32.490
Let's get 50.

36:32.557 --> 36:34.592
Make sure you keep
that stance open.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.227
Please, Richard...

36:38.396 --> 36:40.665
-Oh! Blame your dad.

36:40.731 --> 36:43.935
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.
What are you doing?

36:44.035 --> 36:46.537
This is it. What! That's it.

36:49.407 --> 36:50.775
Trust it, trust it.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.843
-Better!

36:52.910 --> 36:54.378
Yes!

36:57.248 --> 36:58.549
Yeah.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.919
Lemme see
a little bit more pronation

37:02.019 --> 37:03.721
on that wrist
right at the end.

37:03.788 --> 37:05.256
You just focus right here.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.024
You know
exactly what you're doing.

37:07.091 --> 37:09.527
Do you want to be the best?
You can do it. You know why?

37:09.594 --> 37:11.095
Because you're
a killing machine.

37:11.195 --> 37:15.733
You're a goddamn attack dog.
So, bite.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.301
Talk a little louder, Paul.
Can't hear you.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.603
That wasn't for you, Richard.

37:18.703 --> 37:20.404
I'm trying
to record though, Paul.

37:20.471 --> 37:22.306
You can
interview me later.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.978
Yes!
- There you go.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.114
Yes! That's what the pronation
gets you right there.

37:31.949 --> 37:32.984
Really?

37:34.986 --> 37:37.421
Yeah! Keep it up. Keep it up.

37:37.488 --> 37:38.923
That's the move.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.491
Now get back to the middle.
Get back to the middle.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.159
You never know
where that ball's gonna go.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.995
You gotta be ready.
Stay low, stay low,

37:44.095 --> 37:45.730
stay low, stay low, stay low.

37:45.796 --> 37:47.999
Yeah, baby! Yes!

37:48.099 --> 37:53.004
Go!
You're on it. That's it.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.507
End the point. Recover quick.
You gotta move faster.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.175
Hold on, Junior, Junior.
Junior.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.011
All right, Paul, one second.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.746
Look, you just got
a little closed up that time.

38:01.812 --> 38:02.980
You're doing real good.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.782
You just gotta keep
that stance open.

38:04.849 --> 38:06.350
-You plant that right foot...
-What are you doing, Richard?

38:06.450 --> 38:07.652
...that's how you get
a little closed off...

38:07.752 --> 38:09.854
Richard, what are you doing?

38:09.954 --> 38:11.856
I'm talking to my daughter.
Is something wrong with that?

38:11.956 --> 38:13.257
No, nothing wrong with that.

38:13.324 --> 38:14.959
Except you want me
to fix her stance,

38:15.026 --> 38:16.427
and I can't do that if you
keep telling her to hit open.

38:16.494 --> 38:17.762
Well, Paul, ain't no reason

38:17.828 --> 38:19.463
to fix something
that's not broke. Okay?

38:19.530 --> 38:20.865
You've been hollering
at the girl

38:20.965 --> 38:22.533
all day long
to get back to the middle,

38:22.633 --> 38:24.135
get back to the middle.
That's all I hear you saying.

38:24.201 --> 38:26.304
Yet you instructing her
to close her stance.

38:26.370 --> 38:27.672
That's right.

38:27.772 --> 38:28.873
How's she supposed to get back
to the middle

38:28.973 --> 38:30.207
with her stance all closed up?

38:30.308 --> 38:32.977
Okay, if she stays open,
she can plant that foot.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.378
-More power, more speed.
- No!

38:34.478 --> 38:35.546
That's how she get back
to the middle.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.181
That is not how you get power.

38:37.281 --> 38:38.883
You want power in your stroke,
you square your shoulders,

38:38.983 --> 38:40.484
you close your stance,

38:40.551 --> 38:42.186
hold your head right at
contact, and blast through it.

38:42.286 --> 38:44.555
You do not hit open stance.
Okay?

38:44.655 --> 38:46.223
-Yep.
-Can we please get back to it?

38:46.324 --> 38:47.525
But just keep
your mind open, Paul.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.826
You know,
just in case you not...

38:48.893 --> 38:50.294
Richard, it would be
really helpful...

38:50.361 --> 38:51.796
...the smartest person
in the whole world.

38:51.862 --> 38:53.397
...if we could
actually hit a few.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.066
-Okay, yeah, you can hit 'em.
-Because I got about

38:55.166 --> 38:56.734
18 minutes left and I'd like
to finish this practice.

38:56.834 --> 38:57.902
It just don't make no sense
what you saying, Paul.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.570
If she keep her stance closed,

38:59.670 --> 39:01.172
-feet are all jumbled up...
-I'll tell you what, Richard.

39:01.238 --> 39:02.907
She's not gonna
be able to get back.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.475
I'll get my lesson from
you when we're done, okay?

39:04.542 --> 39:06.077
But right now,
I'd like to focus on Venus.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.478
Okay, yeah, I keep forgetting
you know everything.

39:07.545 --> 39:08.245
-17 minutes now.
-I keep forgetting that.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.580
That's it.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.349
Okay, just as long as
she hits some open.

39:15.853 --> 39:16.987
Keep that stance open, Junior.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.889
Recover,
recover, recover.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.025
Get around it. Get around it.
I want a forehand.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.893
I want a forehand.
Get back to center.

39:22.993 --> 39:24.228
There you go.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.868
Great serve.
You know, Capriati is...

39:30.935 --> 39:32.536
Dang, that's Capriati?

39:32.603 --> 39:34.271
Now,
she's a freaking killer.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.340
Won the Junior Orange Bowl
in Miami

39:36.407 --> 39:38.442
in the U.S. 18 and Under
when she was 12.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.111
Just went pro last year.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.380
That's her coach Rick Macci.
He's in Florida.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.382
About as dumb
as the rest, but...

39:44.448 --> 39:47.418
she is the youngest pro ever
to be ranked in the Top 10.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.253
And guess what she just did?

39:49.353 --> 39:51.389
She just beat Steffi Graf.

39:51.455 --> 39:53.457
How do you think
she learned how to do that?

39:53.557 --> 39:56.227
Juniors.
That's where the fight is.

39:56.293 --> 39:58.796
That's where you face
adversity, competition.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.398
It's also where
you get noticed by agents

40:00.464 --> 40:01.899
who can help you pay
for the training

40:01.966 --> 40:03.467
and introduce you to sponsors.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.736
Capriati signed a $2 million
contract with Diadora

40:05.803 --> 40:08.105
before she played
a single pro match.

40:08.205 --> 40:09.774
How do you think
that happened?

40:09.874 --> 40:10.875
Juniors.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.081
So, what do you guys say?
Wanna play Juniors?

40:20.451 --> 40:22.553
I think I can add that
to the plan.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.423
We play some Juniors.

40:25.489 --> 40:29.326
And the pavements are burning

40:29.427 --> 40:32.329
Come on. Come on.
Do you feel good?

40:32.430 --> 40:34.598
-Yes. I'm excited.
-Okay.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.335
Good morning.
Good morning.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.004
Did you see that, Mom?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.172
It's okay.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.339
They're just
not used to seeing

40:42.440 --> 40:44.175
good-looking peoples like us.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.342
You don't worry about them.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.777
Let them worry about you,
Venus.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.447
Oh, this it.
This it right here.

40:50.915 --> 40:54.285
Come on, come on, come on.
Just take a step there.

40:54.351 --> 40:55.786
-Kick their butts.
-All right, y'all.

40:55.853 --> 40:57.955
-Have fun. Bye.
-Thanks. Love you.

40:58.022 --> 40:59.190
All right.

41:00.624 --> 41:04.295
Okay. You just focus
on that ball. Okay?

41:04.361 --> 41:07.264
You are Venus Williams.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.034
You gonna win Wimbledon.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.602
These girls ain't never
gonna wanna see

41:11.669 --> 41:14.772
your name in their draw. Okay?

41:14.839 --> 41:15.973
Okay, Daddy.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.775
You just go on out there
and you have fun.

41:17.842 --> 41:20.177
I know. I got this.

41:20.277 --> 41:21.946
-All right.
-Okay. I love you.

41:22.012 --> 41:23.047
I love you.

41:48.706 --> 41:50.641
All right, girls,
meet at the net.

42:03.153 --> 42:06.156
Best of three sets.
Tiebreaks at six-all.

42:06.223 --> 42:07.825
I'm covering three courts.

42:07.892 --> 42:11.095
So, keep your own score
and call your own lines.

42:16.767 --> 42:18.235
Good luck.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.074
Okay, up or down?

42:25.075 --> 42:27.011
Up, I guess. Thanks.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.883
Down. You can serve.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.935
She knows who she is.
We've done our job.

42:51.035 --> 42:52.269
Yeah, yeah.

42:52.369 --> 42:53.737
-She'll be fine.
-Mm-hmm.

42:53.804 --> 42:55.472
Come on, V,
you got this!

42:55.573 --> 42:56.774
Good luck, V!

42:57.775 --> 42:58.943
Come on, Venus.

43:03.247 --> 43:07.418
She's nervous. Take a step up.

43:07.484 --> 43:09.386
You just have some
fun out there, Venus Williams.

43:09.453 --> 43:11.288
That's all this about.
Have some fun.

43:23.467 --> 43:24.802
Good job, V!

43:24.902 --> 43:27.104
Maybe she ought to take
a few more steps up.

43:27.171 --> 43:28.939
You know,
just get someplace safe.

43:30.908 --> 43:31.942
Don't move.

43:45.456 --> 43:46.991
-You are so freaking stupid.
-

43:47.091 --> 43:49.159
All right, Venus!
- Go, Venus!

43:51.295 --> 43:52.630
All right, V.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.933
-You watching? You watching?
-Mm-hmm.

44:00.437 --> 44:02.606
-You're so bad!
-

44:04.375 --> 44:05.609
Damn!

44:05.676 --> 44:06.810
Good job!

44:08.178 --> 44:09.647
I am talking to you.
I am talking to you.

44:09.713 --> 44:11.382
Do you even want to be
out there right now?

44:11.482 --> 44:12.650
Do you?

44:12.716 --> 44:13.951
Because the way
that you just played,

44:14.018 --> 44:15.452
it's hard to believe
that you do.

44:19.356 --> 44:20.391
Thank you.

44:22.359 --> 44:24.662
Venus!

44:24.728 --> 44:26.230
Get in here,
get in here.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.531
I'm so proud of you.

44:27.631 --> 44:28.999
Get in my picture.
Get in my picture.

44:29.066 --> 44:31.335
Come on, come on.
Come on, Paul!

44:31.402 --> 44:32.569
Say, "Venus!"

44:32.670 --> 44:34.805
Venus!
-

44:34.872 --> 44:36.573
That's it. That's it.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.047
Bad sportsmanship.

44:43.147 --> 44:45.049
Yeah!

44:45.149 --> 44:47.751
Can I take a picture
with the winner?

44:47.851 --> 44:49.053
Right here. Hold it.

44:49.153 --> 44:50.521
-Oh, you look so good.
-So proud of you.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.893
Let's go, Venus!
-

44:55.993 --> 44:59.763
Kelly. Kelly. Kelly.
It was out. Call it.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.065
It was out.

45:01.165 --> 45:03.100
What?
- No.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.935
- No, it wasn't.

45:05.035 --> 45:06.837
It wasn't out,
though.
- Can they do that?

45:06.904 --> 45:08.272
-It's all right.
- They can't do that.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.707
That's okay, Junior.

45:09.773 --> 45:11.608
Just do what you do.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.378
Just cheating.
- That's all right.

45:14.445 --> 45:17.014
Just watch this one.

45:17.081 --> 45:19.783
-Come on, Venus.
- You got this, V.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.385
30-40.

45:31.695 --> 45:34.898
Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah, V, good job!

45:36.734 --> 45:38.302
All right. All right.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.436
That's it.

45:42.372 --> 45:43.640
It's all right.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.476
Come on, y'all.
- What's wrong?

45:45.576 --> 45:46.710
That's okay.
- What's wrong?
You won.

45:46.777 --> 45:48.045
Okay, you can smile.

45:48.112 --> 45:49.480
-You can smile.
-

45:49.580 --> 45:50.647
That was good.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.483
A little adversity.
That's okay.

45:57.054 --> 45:58.288
You're missin' it.

45:58.388 --> 45:59.957
No, I can hear everything
with that ball.

46:00.057 --> 46:01.825
Good play.
- Come on!

46:01.925 --> 46:03.827
You got this.

46:03.927 --> 46:06.296
-

46:09.233 --> 46:10.334
Did you see any of that?

46:10.434 --> 46:13.170
Yes, I saw some of that.

46:13.270 --> 46:14.772
Come on, y'all, come on.
Whoo. Yay.

46:14.838 --> 46:16.473
Wait, where's Meka? She okay?

46:16.573 --> 46:18.308
Yeah, she's fine.
She's just bored.

46:18.408 --> 46:20.577
-Said she knew you would win.
-

46:23.347 --> 46:25.816
You were so good.
- Thank you.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.119
I told you that girl
was a pusher.

46:29.186 --> 46:31.789
Yeah, Paul calls that
"playing patty-cake."

46:31.855 --> 46:34.191
That's why she got moded.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.293
Moded. Corroded.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.296
Your booty exploded.

46:39.363 --> 46:42.766
40-15.
-

47:25.843 --> 47:26.810
Thank you.

47:26.877 --> 47:27.911
Thank you.

47:36.520 --> 47:37.721
Cheese.

47:37.821 --> 47:39.223
There you go.
There you go.

47:39.323 --> 47:41.158
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-Thank you.

47:41.225 --> 47:42.693
-Nice meeting you.
-Nice to meet you.

47:42.759 --> 47:43.994
You did real good.
You did real good.

47:44.061 --> 47:45.395
Bye.

47:45.495 --> 47:47.064
You should be very proud
of yourself. You did good.

47:47.164 --> 47:48.165
Well done.

47:49.032 --> 47:50.434
Mommy, wait.

47:50.534 --> 47:52.769
The first place
Junior Tennis Tournament

47:52.870 --> 47:56.840
is presented
to Venus Williams!

47:59.676 --> 48:01.078
Go, V!

48:01.178 --> 48:02.179
She won!

48:02.246 --> 48:03.881
She won. She won.

48:03.947 --> 48:08.352
Moded. Corroded.
Your booty exploded.

48:08.418 --> 48:10.187
That looked
kinda heavy up there.

48:10.254 --> 48:12.723
Let me see.
Let me see that big ol' thing.

48:12.789 --> 48:13.957
Ooh. I'm about to drop it.

48:14.057 --> 48:15.626
Were you
nervous at all, V?

48:15.726 --> 48:16.793
Why is she nervous?

48:16.894 --> 48:18.061
That girl looked like
she was 18

48:18.128 --> 48:19.796
and Venus
still whupped her anyway.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.932
Yeah.
-Yes, she did.

48:22.032 --> 48:23.533
Okay, that's enough of that
back there.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.968
No more tennis talk.

48:25.068 --> 48:26.737
And stop all that bragging.

48:26.803 --> 48:28.038
Daddy,
we're not bragging.

48:28.105 --> 48:30.274
Oh, you're not?
What you doing?

48:30.374 --> 48:33.210
I mean, it's just the truth,
and here's the proof.

48:33.277 --> 48:34.611
- That's right.

48:34.711 --> 48:36.113
Right now,
let's hear what I'm saying.

48:36.213 --> 48:37.281
Stop all that bragging.

48:37.381 --> 48:39.216
Richard, they're not bragging.

48:39.283 --> 48:40.550
They bragging.

48:40.617 --> 48:41.885
-I'm listening to 'em.
-They're having fun.

48:41.952 --> 48:43.120
I know what bragging
sounds like.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.421
The girl won.
She's just happy.

48:44.488 --> 48:45.422
Look, Junior won,
the other girl lost.

48:45.489 --> 48:46.823
Everybody did their best.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.558
And I'm not gonna hear
no more about it now.

48:52.095 --> 48:53.797
If that was that girl's best,

48:53.897 --> 48:55.399
then she needs
to practice some more.

48:55.465 --> 48:57.901
-I'm just saying. Jeez.

49:05.809 --> 49:07.678
Okay, you big shots.

49:07.778 --> 49:08.845
Here's five bucks.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.347
Go on and get me
something to drink.

49:10.447 --> 49:11.481
-I wanna get something.
-Stop. Stop. Stop.

49:11.581 --> 49:13.016
Uh, give the money to Tunde.

49:13.116 --> 49:14.518
-Give the money to Tunde.
-Stop arguing. Stop arguing.

49:14.618 --> 49:15.986
Why do they always take
the money from me?

49:16.086 --> 49:17.354
Daddy gave it to me.
Not to you, Tunde.

49:31.468 --> 49:32.936
Richard...

49:33.770 --> 49:35.038
Where are you going?

49:35.138 --> 49:36.340
They wanna brag, let them brag

49:36.440 --> 49:38.108
about how they walked
three miles home.

49:38.175 --> 49:40.277
Richard, you can't leave
those girls like that.

49:40.344 --> 49:41.878
I done told them I didn't
wanna hear nothing about

49:41.979 --> 49:45.782
-no tennis and no bragging.
-Richard, stop! Stop!

49:45.849 --> 49:47.551
You can't leave them
back there like that.

49:47.651 --> 49:49.186
Leaving 'em
on the streets like that.

49:49.286 --> 49:50.220
You can't do that.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.888
Okay, look at me. Listen here.

49:51.989 --> 49:54.291
I'm listening.
You go back and get my girls.

49:54.358 --> 49:55.692
When these matches is over,

49:55.792 --> 49:58.195
I don't wanna hear
nothing about no tennis.

49:58.295 --> 50:01.465
Okay? They can talk
about Kingdom Hall,

50:01.531 --> 50:04.234
they can talk about dinosaurs,
they can talk about space.

50:04.334 --> 50:05.669
-Space?
-But I don't wanna hear...

50:05.736 --> 50:07.237
Why is it that
you gotta ruin...

50:07.337 --> 50:08.405
-...nothing about no tennis.
-...everybody else's day?

50:08.505 --> 50:09.740
You don't wanna be happy...

50:09.840 --> 50:11.375
I don't
wanna hear no bragging.

50:11.475 --> 50:12.976
...so you don't want
nobody else to be happy.

50:13.043 --> 50:14.578
-This ain't about being happy.
- No...

50:14.678 --> 50:16.079
-It's about bragging.
- ...it is about it.

50:16.179 --> 50:17.647
You don't want
nobody else to be happy...

50:17.714 --> 50:19.316
I told them
I don't want no bragging.

50:19.383 --> 50:20.817
...so you gotta make
everybody else upset.

50:20.884 --> 50:22.219
I have never in my life...
Never ever met

50:22.319 --> 50:23.253
somebody who just
don't wanna be happy.

50:23.353 --> 50:24.755
I don't want no bragging.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.590
You go back and get my girls.

50:35.432 --> 50:37.901
Daddy, where were you going?
I thought you were leaving us.

50:38.001 --> 50:39.269
Yeah, I was.
Thank your mother.

50:39.369 --> 50:40.771

51:36.259 --> 51:39.162
-That's good. Lyn?
-To be brave.

51:39.262 --> 51:41.798
Brave? Explain how you mean.

51:41.898 --> 51:43.266
Well, you gotta be
pretty brave

51:43.333 --> 51:44.668
to take a ride in a pumpkin.

51:47.637 --> 51:49.739
-Okay, go to your room.
-Why, Daddy?

51:49.806 --> 51:51.441
No, 'cause
you fooling with me,

51:51.508 --> 51:53.743
and I'm not fooling with you.
Go ahead. Go to your room.

51:53.810 --> 51:56.079
Okay.

51:59.282 --> 52:03.420
-Never stop dreaming, I guess.
-Mm-hmm. That's good.

52:03.487 --> 52:05.088
Come on, Meek.

52:05.155 --> 52:07.691
Remember your shoes?

52:07.791 --> 52:10.360
Okay, that's good,
but everybody's wrong.

52:10.460 --> 52:11.695
So we gonna watch
the film again.

52:11.795 --> 52:12.796
We gonna watch
this whole film again.

52:12.863 --> 52:13.864
No, Richard, no.

52:13.964 --> 52:14.998
Lyn,
come on out here.

52:15.098 --> 52:16.800
We watching this film again.

52:16.867 --> 52:18.168
No, ain't nobody listening.

52:18.268 --> 52:20.137
If you're not gonna listen
to the film...

52:20.203 --> 52:21.872
-I answered your question.
- Okay, okay.

52:21.972 --> 52:23.373
They answered your questions.

52:23.473 --> 52:25.375
All right, all right.
Hold on. Hold on.

52:25.475 --> 52:28.812
The point is she was humble.

52:28.879 --> 52:31.548
No matter how
them peoples treated her,

52:31.648 --> 52:33.650
no matter how disrespected,

52:33.717 --> 52:37.554
she stayed calm,
she kept her heart clean.

52:38.488 --> 52:40.557
She was humble.

52:40.657 --> 52:42.959
Now we gonna go out here and
we gonna play these matches

52:43.026 --> 52:44.895
and we gonna compete.

52:44.995 --> 52:47.998
But we gonna stay humble,
else we not gonna do it.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.203
All right, y'all can go ahead
with yourself.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.215
You feel good about yourself?

53:06.983 --> 53:08.351
I mean,
I think they got the point.

53:08.418 --> 53:11.021
Never drive off
on my kids again.

53:11.087 --> 53:12.589
-Ever.
-That's where you still at?

53:12.689 --> 53:14.558
-That's where you still at?
-Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

53:22.365 --> 53:24.434

53:24.534 --> 53:25.769
Okay, okay,

53:25.869 --> 53:28.205
now when these balls is wet,

53:28.271 --> 53:30.040
So you can't
let them hit the ground

53:30.106 --> 53:31.374
'cause they not gonna bounce.

53:31.441 --> 53:33.176
If they hit the ground,
they gonna skid.

53:33.243 --> 53:35.245
I need you to take it
right out of the air.

53:35.345 --> 53:37.380
Take it right out the air.

53:37.447 --> 53:39.683
Right out of the air.
There you go.

53:39.749 --> 53:41.952
I like that. I like that.

53:42.052 --> 53:44.588
Don't let it bounce.
Don't let it bounce.

53:44.688 --> 53:46.523
-Don't let it bounce.
-

53:47.257 --> 53:48.792
Boom! Boom!

53:48.892 --> 53:51.628
Oh, now that shot right there
gonna make me call the police.

53:51.728 --> 53:54.264
That's the shot
I got to call the police.

53:55.699 --> 53:56.800
Well, at least ain't nobody

53:56.900 --> 53:58.301

no bath tonight.

54:05.442 --> 54:07.978
Hey!
-Get back, get moving. Hey.

54:09.779 --> 54:12.249

Go ahead.
Y'all get in the car.

55:03.867 --> 55:05.602
Daddy,
why are the police here?

55:05.669 --> 55:06.870
I don't know.

55:10.373 --> 55:11.708
Do you
sometimes don't get

55:11.808 --> 55:13.109
to have dinner
before you go to sleep?

55:13.176 --> 55:14.778
No, ma'am.

55:14.844 --> 55:16.846
What's going on?
Everybody okay?

55:16.946 --> 55:18.448
They got a call.

55:18.515 --> 55:20.150
Said there was trouble
in the house,

55:20.216 --> 55:22.052
and that we were being rough
with the girls,

55:22.152 --> 55:23.887
and they needed to look.

55:23.987 --> 55:26.990
-A call from who?
-Not at liberty to say.

55:29.492 --> 55:31.795
-Okay, okay.
- Yeah.

55:31.861 --> 55:33.730
You... You all need
to look around?

55:33.830 --> 55:35.899
Go ahead, you can check on
in the cupboards.

55:35.999 --> 55:37.500
Maybe you go check
under their beds,

55:37.567 --> 55:38.968
make sure there's no monsters.

55:39.035 --> 55:40.637
It's a little wet
for practice, don't you think?

55:40.704 --> 55:41.871
Don't the girls have
schoolwork to do?

55:41.971 --> 55:44.040
They do their homework.

55:44.140 --> 55:47.744
Tunde's first in her class.
Lyn and Isha are, too.

55:47.844 --> 55:51.181
That's right.
Girls, spell "civilization."

55:51.247 --> 55:54.651
C-I-V-I-L-I-Z-A-T-I-O-N.

55:54.718 --> 55:56.019
-Okay, Mr. Williams...
- Wait, now hold on.

55:56.086 --> 55:57.153
...this is
really not necessary.

55:57.220 --> 55:58.588
Hold on.

55:58.688 --> 56:01.324
You wanna check on the kids?
Let's check on the kids.

56:03.026 --> 56:05.729
We got future doctors
and lawyers,

56:05.829 --> 56:09.766
plus a couple of tennis stars
in this house.

56:09.866 --> 56:11.501
Now, I understand
you got to do your job

56:11.568 --> 56:14.504
even if some
crazy-ass neighbor do call,

56:14.571 --> 56:16.439

56:16.539 --> 56:18.508
And I don't even mind you
saying we hard on these kids,

56:18.575 --> 56:20.744
you know why? 'Cause we are!

56:20.844 --> 56:24.914
That's our job,
to keep 'em off these streets.

56:25.014 --> 56:27.183
You wanna arrest us
for that? Fine.

56:27.250 --> 56:28.718
But what you not

56:28.785 --> 56:29.886

56:34.724 --> 56:36.025

56:36.092 --> 56:39.629
That's what you not never
gonna say in this house.

56:39.729 --> 56:42.532
You wanna arrest us for that?

56:42.599 --> 56:44.067
That's fine.
You need to be arresting

56:44.134 --> 56:45.702
them parents
at them tennis matches.

56:45.769 --> 56:48.405
That's who needs
to be getting arrested.

57:05.155 --> 57:07.323
-Hey, where you going?
-I'll be back.

57:28.611 --> 57:30.513
-Hey, Betty.
-Oracene.

57:30.613 --> 57:32.582
I've never been
over here before.

57:32.649 --> 57:34.117
-You haven't.
-That's a shame.

57:34.184 --> 57:35.685
It is.

57:35.785 --> 57:39.022
I know you know how hard it is
raising a daughter.

57:40.523 --> 57:42.625
I have five of them.

57:43.460 --> 57:44.627
Five.

57:47.697 --> 57:49.866
Don't make me come back
over here again.

58:22.131 --> 58:23.733
All right, Venus,
you're running a little late.

58:23.833 --> 58:25.702
It's about to start.
So you're on court three.

58:25.802 --> 58:26.970
-Good luck out there.
-Thank you.

58:27.036 --> 58:29.506
Okay, come on.
Come on. Come on.

58:29.572 --> 58:32.542
Can't be the only Black
peoples here and be late.

58:37.580 --> 58:39.649
Um, Serena Williams.
10 and under.

58:39.716 --> 58:42.085
-I'm signing in, too.
-Oh, okay.

58:42.185 --> 58:44.754
Let me find you here.
You are on court nine.

58:44.854 --> 58:46.356
I'll send your opponent

58:46.422 --> 58:47.824
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

58:51.261 --> 58:52.595
-There you go.
-

58:52.695 --> 58:55.398
Great shot, Venus Williams.
Good decision.

58:55.498 --> 58:57.433
Your daughter
looks good out there.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.068
Yeah, thank you.
She a little tight today.

58:59.168 --> 59:03.406
No, I mean the little one.
She looks like a champ, too.

59:03.506 --> 59:06.109
Could have warned us, man.
I didn't know you had two.

59:38.908 --> 59:41.711
May as well let her finish.

59:41.778 --> 59:43.313
- Come on!

59:43.413 --> 59:45.582
Whoo!

1:00:00.229 --> 1:00:02.799
Go on.
Just make sure you have fun.

1:00:02.899 --> 1:00:04.901
That's all we here to do.
Go ahead. Have fun.

1:00:06.135 --> 1:00:09.339
Serena Williams!

1:00:10.974 --> 1:00:14.577
-You knew about this?
-No. Mm-mm.

1:00:16.346 --> 1:00:17.480
That's real.

1:00:18.948 --> 1:00:21.084
Hey, you want it? We can swap.

1:00:21.150 --> 1:00:22.685
I like silver better anyway.

1:00:22.785 --> 1:00:24.420
Good. I like gold.

1:00:26.289 --> 1:00:28.091
"At a time
when tennis prodigies

1:00:28.157 --> 1:00:29.759
seem to be surfacing
every week,

1:00:29.826 --> 1:00:33.129
the latest hot prospect is
Californian Venus Williams."

1:00:35.131 --> 1:00:36.165
There she go.

1:00:37.033 --> 1:00:38.201
"Last weekend,

1:00:38.301 --> 1:00:40.870
Williams captured
her 17th Singles title

1:00:40.970 --> 1:00:44.007
in less than a year by
winning the age 12 and under

1:00:44.107 --> 1:00:46.175
Southern California Junior
Sectional Championship."

1:00:46.275 --> 1:00:47.543
Listen to this, y'all.

1:00:47.644 --> 1:00:48.811
"In the first place,

1:00:48.878 --> 1:00:50.513
she played like she was
16 years old..."

1:00:50.613 --> 1:00:52.048
...incident of police
brutality in Los Angeles.

1:00:52.148 --> 1:00:54.350
CNN's Robert Vito
has the story,

1:00:54.450 --> 1:00:56.152
but first,
this word of caution.

1:00:56.219 --> 1:00:57.854
Some of you may be disturbed

1:00:57.954 --> 1:00:59.355
by the violent nature
of the pictures contained...

1:00:59.455 --> 1:01:01.391
"Her concentration
was excellent.

1:01:01.491 --> 1:01:03.059
Boy, did she wax me."

1:01:03.159 --> 1:01:05.061
That's from
Dorothy Cheney, y'all.

1:01:05.161 --> 1:01:06.863
-Dang, Venus, you're famous.
-

1:01:06.963 --> 1:01:08.297
One step at a time.

1:01:08.364 --> 1:01:09.399
...what appears
to be a group

1:01:09.499 --> 1:01:10.800
of Los Angeles police officers

1:01:10.867 --> 1:01:12.735
beating a suspect
with nightsticks

1:01:12.835 --> 1:01:15.471
and kicking him
as other officers look on.

1:01:15.538 --> 1:01:16.906
George Holliday,

1:01:17.006 --> 1:01:18.374
who works for
a drain cleaning company,

1:01:18.474 --> 1:01:19.575
-taped the incident...
-

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:21.310
-Tunde?
-I'll get it.

1:01:21.377 --> 1:01:22.979
The incident
followed a car chase

1:01:23.046 --> 1:01:24.681
where police say the suspect,
who is Black,

1:01:24.747 --> 1:01:26.149
was driving more
than 100 miles an hour.

1:01:26.215 --> 1:01:27.650
At least they got them
on tape this time.

1:01:27.717 --> 1:01:29.085
They also say
he was wanted

1:01:29.185 --> 1:01:30.486
on suspicion
of parole violation...

1:01:30.553 --> 1:01:32.055
Hello.
Samson Security Service.

1:01:32.155 --> 1:01:33.756
...on a robbery conviction.
The suspect,

1:01:33.856 --> 1:01:35.892
identified as 25-year-old
Rodney Glen King...

1:01:35.992 --> 1:01:37.360
Daddy,
the phone's for you.

1:01:37.427 --> 1:01:38.695
The guy's an agent

1:01:38.761 --> 1:01:40.496
and wants to talk to you
about representation.

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:46.402
I was at a clinic in Oakland

1:01:46.502 --> 1:01:49.939
when a young girl came up
and asked me,

1:01:50.039 --> 1:01:55.111
"What do we do if our friends
pressure us to do drugs?"

1:01:55.211 --> 1:02:01.050
And without thinking,
I said, "Just say no."

1:02:07.690 --> 1:02:09.192
Pretty incredible.

1:02:10.393 --> 1:02:11.794
Your girls are standing

1:02:11.894 --> 1:02:14.197
with the former First Lady
of the United States.

1:02:14.263 --> 1:02:15.364
You did that.

1:02:15.431 --> 1:02:17.934
Enjoy the tennis,
everyone.

1:02:25.274 --> 1:02:26.809
There's the man.

1:02:26.909 --> 1:02:28.444
Richard. I want you to meet

1:02:28.544 --> 1:02:30.146
George MacArthur
and Laird Stabler.

1:02:30.246 --> 1:02:31.948
-George. Laird.
-Hey, Richard,

1:02:32.048 --> 1:02:33.316
nice to meet you.
We spoke on the phone.

1:02:33.416 --> 1:02:34.550
Oh, that's right.
Good to meet you.

1:02:34.617 --> 1:02:35.818
George is the head
of their agency.

1:02:35.918 --> 1:02:37.153
Oh, that the big boss.

1:02:37.253 --> 1:02:38.588
That's the big boss
right there.

1:02:38.654 --> 1:02:39.889
Yeah,
I can tell by the cigar.

1:02:39.956 --> 1:02:42.325
-Sit down, guys.
-Oh, thank you, yes.

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:45.428
Heck of a girl you got there.
Just incredible.

1:02:45.495 --> 1:02:48.431
Love to help you take her
to the next level. Yeah.

1:02:48.498 --> 1:02:49.832
Can I get you anything?

1:02:49.932 --> 1:02:51.167
Usual.

1:02:51.267 --> 1:02:52.435
-Fine, thank you.
-I'll have an Arnold Palmer,

1:02:52.502 --> 1:02:53.836
-please.
-I'm good.

1:02:55.171 --> 1:02:56.906
Well, thanks for coming,
Richard.

1:02:56.973 --> 1:02:58.307
What do you think of the club?

1:02:58.407 --> 1:03:00.343
Oh, it's...
It's really great.

1:03:00.443 --> 1:03:02.578
We appreciate everybody
taking off their hoods

1:03:02.645 --> 1:03:04.180
before we came in.

1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:06.516
Richard.
- We like that.

1:03:06.616 --> 1:03:08.251
You know, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

1:03:08.317 --> 1:03:11.487
It's, uh... We've been here
a couple of times.

1:03:11.587 --> 1:03:12.822
Well, Richard, first off,

1:03:12.922 --> 1:03:14.457
we would just like
to congratulate you

1:03:14.524 --> 1:03:16.959
on a great job
you've done so far.

1:03:17.026 --> 1:03:18.461
Quite honestly,
it's incredible.

1:03:18.528 --> 1:03:20.363
It's incredible?
-Yes.

1:03:28.004 --> 1:03:30.940
I'm sure you know,
but Laird here is the best.

1:03:31.007 --> 1:03:32.141
Mm-hmm.

1:03:32.208 --> 1:03:34.110
He discovered Capriati
when she was 10.

1:03:34.177 --> 1:03:35.444
Mary Pierce, too.

1:03:35.511 --> 1:03:37.780
And we believe that Venus
can be bigger than both.

1:03:37.847 --> 1:03:40.216
I'm sorry, you, um...

1:03:40.316 --> 1:03:43.786
You said two times already.
You said it's incredible.

1:03:43.853 --> 1:03:44.987
-Yeah.
-And, uh,

1:03:45.054 --> 1:03:47.824
why is what we did
so incredible?

1:03:47.890 --> 1:03:50.059
Well, I just meant
with your resources,

1:03:50.159 --> 1:03:51.394
and your experiences.

1:03:51.494 --> 1:03:53.062
Richard, I think
all that Laird is saying is

1:03:53.162 --> 1:03:54.630
that you've done an incredible
job with the girls.

1:03:54.697 --> 1:03:56.465
Hold on.
Hold on, Paul.

1:03:56.532 --> 1:04:00.636
That is a full-grown adult man
sitting right there.

1:04:00.703 --> 1:04:03.139
He don't need you to say
what he said.

1:04:03.206 --> 1:04:04.574
If you was gonna say
what he said,

1:04:04.674 --> 1:04:05.808
you could have said it
back at the house.

1:04:05.875 --> 1:04:07.076
We could have saved everybody

1:04:07.176 --> 1:04:08.911
the trouble of coming
to this meeting.

1:04:09.011 --> 1:04:12.081
Now, I asked this man
a simplified question.

1:04:12.181 --> 1:04:14.750
He over-emphasizing
how incredible it is,

1:04:14.851 --> 1:04:16.352
"it's so incredible"
what we did.

1:04:16.419 --> 1:04:17.753
I see all these White kids
around here.

1:04:17.854 --> 1:04:19.255
He ain't saying
how incredible that is.

1:04:19.355 --> 1:04:20.823
Let him answer the question.

1:04:20.890 --> 1:04:22.191
Okay. Let's answer...
That's why we're here.

1:04:22.258 --> 1:04:23.759
Why it's so incredible
what we did?

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.161
Sir, I'm sorry.
-We're here to ask questions.

1:04:25.228 --> 1:04:27.230
I certainly did not mean

1:04:27.330 --> 1:04:28.931
to make any offence there,
Mr. Williams.

1:04:29.031 --> 1:04:30.933
I'm very sorry. I just meant
with your background and...

1:04:31.033 --> 1:04:32.335
Our background.

1:04:32.401 --> 1:04:34.403
Now, of course,
what you mean is our race.

1:04:35.738 --> 1:04:37.173
No, it's okay.
It's okay. I get it.

1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:39.775
You know, little Black girl,
all-White sport.

1:04:39.876 --> 1:04:41.611
That's why we picked tennis.

1:04:41.711 --> 1:04:45.181
Your little, uh,
ghetto Cinderella.

1:04:45.248 --> 1:04:47.450
Your Ghetto-rella.

1:04:47.550 --> 1:04:49.719
Well, that's exactly what
we're talking about, Richard.

1:04:49.785 --> 1:04:51.287
We think Venus could be
very inspirational

1:04:51.387 --> 1:04:52.622
to a whole group of people

1:04:52.722 --> 1:04:54.090
who quite honestly,
as an industry,

1:04:54.190 --> 1:04:56.259
we have not done enough
to reach.

1:04:56.359 --> 1:04:57.927
Venus can open a lot of doors.

1:04:58.027 --> 1:04:59.428
And we'd like
to help her do it.

1:04:59.528 --> 1:05:02.531
Okay, okay.
So, uh, what're you offering?

1:05:02.598 --> 1:05:06.135
Whatever you need.
Shoes, coaches, rackets.

1:05:06.235 --> 1:05:08.371
Rackets?

1:05:08.437 --> 1:05:10.573
They offering rackets?

1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:12.475
We wouldn't even be sitting
here if you hadn't seen

1:05:12.575 --> 1:05:14.477
what they had done
with their rackets.

1:05:14.577 --> 1:05:16.212
That's true. Fair enough. Yes.

1:05:16.279 --> 1:05:17.647
Come on.
You sure you the best?

1:05:17.747 --> 1:05:19.081
Well, I don't know.
He said it.

1:05:19.148 --> 1:05:21.083
Richard, can I be frank?

1:05:21.150 --> 1:05:23.953
I think you should be
whoever the hell you wanna be.

1:05:24.053 --> 1:05:26.122
What Venus needs now is
more court time and training.

1:05:26.222 --> 1:05:27.556
The right tournaments
and exposure.

1:05:27.623 --> 1:05:30.226
That's a hundred grand
a year, easy.

1:05:31.794 --> 1:05:33.162
You sign with us

1:05:33.262 --> 1:05:35.631
and we'll help you
carry that burden.

1:05:37.967 --> 1:05:40.503
Let us take it from here.

1:05:40.603 --> 1:05:43.572
Let us make this a sure thing.

1:05:44.974 --> 1:05:47.743
You don't wanna risk all that,
do you, Richard?

1:05:56.786 --> 1:05:58.354
I think I'mma go
get in the pool.

1:05:59.455 --> 1:06:00.756
We'll talk later.

1:06:02.992 --> 1:06:04.694
Lovely to meet you.

1:06:07.430 --> 1:06:08.931
What the hell was that?

1:06:12.034 --> 1:06:14.136
Okay, here you go.

1:06:14.203 --> 1:06:17.340
-Thank you.
- What you all doing?

1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:20.710
-Hey, Daddy. You hungry?
-You want something to eat?

1:06:20.810 --> 1:06:22.478
Where the food
I packed for you?

1:06:22.545 --> 1:06:24.180
Don't worry.
It's all on our tab.

1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:25.281
Mm-hmm.

1:06:25.348 --> 1:06:26.349
It's on your tab?

1:06:26.449 --> 1:06:27.883
It's no big deal, Mr. Williams.

1:06:27.984 --> 1:06:29.318
All the food here is for free.

1:06:29.385 --> 1:06:31.654
Nothing's for free.
Somebody's paying for it.

1:06:31.721 --> 1:06:32.955
Put it down.

1:06:33.022 --> 1:06:34.824
Don't you bite that cookie
one more time.

1:06:34.890 --> 1:06:36.659
Put it down.

1:06:36.726 --> 1:06:39.462
Let's go. Get your little tabs
out in the bus.

1:06:41.130 --> 1:06:42.465
-Bye.
-Bye, guys.

1:06:42.531 --> 1:06:45.067
Daddy, what's wrong?
-What's wrong?

1:06:45.167 --> 1:06:46.402
You sitting
at some country club

1:06:46.502 --> 1:06:47.737
with your legs all crossed

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:50.072
like you Queens of Sheba
from somewhere.

1:06:50.172 --> 1:06:52.808
Never take anything
from anybody for free.

1:06:52.875 --> 1:06:55.311
Everything in this place
got hooks in it.

1:06:56.579 --> 1:06:58.080
No, don't touch us,
Panty-Man!

1:07:01.751 --> 1:07:03.486
Y'all be careful.
- Hey, girls.

1:07:03.552 --> 1:07:05.087
Hi, Mr. Cohen.
-Hiya.

1:07:05.187 --> 1:07:06.655
Hey, Paul.
-Hey, Oracene. How you doing?

1:07:06.722 --> 1:07:08.090
All right. I'll get you
something to drink.

1:07:08.190 --> 1:07:09.692
Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

1:07:12.061 --> 1:07:14.163
So what are we doing here,
Richard?

1:07:14.230 --> 1:07:16.332
What the hell was that
back there?

1:07:16.399 --> 1:07:19.402
-Yeah, we not doing this.
-Not doing what?

1:07:19.502 --> 1:07:21.670
We not signing
with none of them agents.

1:07:21.737 --> 1:07:23.672
We not playing
no more Juniors.

1:07:23.739 --> 1:07:25.708
Have you lost your mind?

1:07:25.775 --> 1:07:28.110
Venus is 63-0, okay?

1:07:28.210 --> 1:07:30.112
You pull her out of Juniors
now, you're gonna ruin it.

1:07:30.212 --> 1:07:31.447
Those girls need
to play matches

1:07:31.547 --> 1:07:33.115
or they're gonna die
on the vine.

1:07:33.215 --> 1:07:35.117
Yeah, I done heard the risk,

1:07:35.217 --> 1:07:38.454
but this Junior circuit
is worse than the ghetto.

1:07:39.855 --> 1:07:41.791
Kids out there cracking up,
burning out.

1:07:41.891 --> 1:07:43.292
Their parents
ought to be shot.

1:07:43.392 --> 1:07:45.861
What are you talking about?
Your daughters are fine.

1:07:45.928 --> 1:07:47.463
Oh, yeah,
they fine now.

1:07:47.563 --> 1:07:48.964
But you heard them agents,

1:07:49.065 --> 1:07:50.633
they talking about
pushing them up the ladder.

1:07:50.733 --> 1:07:52.768
Nationals and Internationals.

1:07:52.868 --> 1:07:56.305
They don't need
all that pressure. Okay?

1:07:56.405 --> 1:07:59.442
They will play matches
when they turn pro.

1:07:59.542 --> 1:08:01.544
And right now, they need
to just do what they're doing.

1:08:01.610 --> 1:08:02.711
They need to just be kids.

1:08:02.778 --> 1:08:04.713
No, there will be no pros,
Richard.

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:06.248
And even if there were,

1:08:06.315 --> 1:08:07.750
you don't sign with an agent,
how're you guys going

1:08:07.817 --> 1:08:08.884
to afford all their training
till then?

1:08:08.951 --> 1:08:09.819
Yeah. Let me worry about that.

1:08:09.919 --> 1:08:10.953
Did you know about this?

1:08:15.391 --> 1:08:18.327
Richard, don't do this.

1:08:18.427 --> 1:08:21.096
Every American player
who's ever done anything

1:08:21.163 --> 1:08:22.565
got good following this path.

1:08:22.631 --> 1:08:24.633
Mac, Tracy, Agassi, Pete.

1:08:24.733 --> 1:08:26.001
Yep.

1:08:26.102 --> 1:08:29.305
This window you guys have
is so freaking small.

1:08:29.405 --> 1:08:30.739
-And it will close.
-Yep.

1:08:30.806 --> 1:08:32.074
I know you don't wanna
believe me, but it will.

1:08:32.141 --> 1:08:33.809
Everybody talking
about this window,

1:08:33.909 --> 1:08:36.345
this... this window
they got to get through.

1:08:36.445 --> 1:08:37.613
But peoples like us,

1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:39.682
we... we get shot
when we go through those.

1:08:39.782 --> 1:08:42.618
So I'm thinking we just gonna
pause right here,

1:08:42.685 --> 1:08:44.353
and then
when the time is right,

1:08:44.453 --> 1:08:46.355
we just gonna walk
through the front door.

1:08:48.124 --> 1:08:50.192
Man, I don't understand.

1:08:51.494 --> 1:08:52.995
You do not have a clue.

1:08:53.095 --> 1:08:55.431
You are pissed off because
some guy insulted you today,

1:08:55.498 --> 1:08:57.800
-so now you wanna walk away.
-Mm-mm.

1:08:57.867 --> 1:08:59.435
You are the most
stubborn person

1:08:59.502 --> 1:09:01.303
I have ever met in my life.

1:09:01.370 --> 1:09:04.206
And I coach McEnroe.

1:09:04.306 --> 1:09:06.709
We appreciate everything
you've done, Paul.

1:09:07.977 --> 1:09:12.548
But this part
of our relationship is done.

1:09:12.648 --> 1:09:13.782
And we will no longer

1:09:13.849 --> 1:09:16.819
be requiring your services
any more.

1:09:16.886 --> 1:09:20.689
Richard, no good coach
is gonna take them for free

1:09:20.789 --> 1:09:22.458
if they're
not playing Juniors.

1:09:22.525 --> 1:09:25.895
Yeah, you did. Remember?

1:09:25.995 --> 1:09:28.564
And I think
you're a pretty good coach.

1:09:37.173 --> 1:09:38.507
All right.

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:44.380
I just pray
you don't screw this up.

1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:46.415
Yeah, we appreciate
your prayers, Paul.

1:09:46.515 --> 1:09:48.751
Mm-hmm.

1:09:48.851 --> 1:09:51.153
Okay, Panty-Man,
we gonna get her!

1:09:51.220 --> 1:09:52.388
Oracene.

1:09:55.257 --> 1:09:57.359
Come on,
before Panty-Man gets you.

1:10:03.866 --> 1:10:05.935
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:10:06.035 --> 1:10:07.937
I'll see you
at Wimbledon, kid.

1:10:14.043 --> 1:10:16.679
Are we a team?

1:10:16.745 --> 1:10:18.581
Are we a team? We a...
We a family.

1:10:19.415 --> 1:10:20.616
So we're a team?

1:10:20.716 --> 1:10:22.117
We a family. The best kind
of team there is.

1:10:22.218 --> 1:10:23.552
And you don't think that
that was a decision

1:10:23.619 --> 1:10:26.222
that you should have
discussed with me?

1:10:26.288 --> 1:10:28.357
Discussed with Venus?

1:10:28.424 --> 1:10:29.758
-What do you...
-Richard,

1:10:29.858 --> 1:10:32.294
my faith dictates
that I stand by your side.

1:10:32.394 --> 1:10:33.796
All right,
well, just do that then.

1:10:33.896 --> 1:10:36.298
But don't mistake my silence
for agreement.

1:10:36.398 --> 1:10:39.702
You do that again,
and I won't be quiet.

1:10:39.768 --> 1:10:41.237
Now, don't do that.
Don't do that to me.

1:10:41.303 --> 1:10:42.871
You don't make a fool
outta me.

1:10:42.938 --> 1:10:44.807
-Who made a fool outta you?
-You made a fool outta me.

1:10:44.907 --> 1:10:47.476
-What are you talking about?
-Don't make a fool out of me.

1:10:47.576 --> 1:10:50.145
Ain't nobody making
no fool outta you.

1:10:57.219 --> 1:11:00.322
Good feet. Excellent.
Get there. Work!

1:11:00.422 --> 1:11:01.924
Excellent.
I like it. I like it.

1:11:01.991 --> 1:11:03.993
Hey, who's aggressive?
Who wants this point?

1:11:04.093 --> 1:11:05.327
Hey! Rick.

1:11:05.427 --> 1:11:07.229
This guy, Richard Williams,
keeps calling.

1:11:07.296 --> 1:11:08.497
It's like the tenth time
in a row.

1:11:08.597 --> 1:11:09.898
Told me to tell you
it's urgent.

1:11:09.965 --> 1:11:12.167
Urgent? What's so urgent?
His backhand?

1:11:12.268 --> 1:11:13.435
You gotta get that ball.

1:11:13.502 --> 1:11:15.404
No, some, uh,
father in California.

1:11:15.471 --> 1:11:16.739
Says he's got two daughters,

1:11:16.805 --> 1:11:18.340
that they're the best
in the state.

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:21.176
Yeah, let me guess,
next Jennifer Capriati?

1:11:21.277 --> 1:11:23.812
These girls so great, how come
I've never heard of 'em?

1:11:24.613 --> 1:11:26.148
They're from Compton.

1:11:26.682 --> 1:11:27.783
Compton?

1:11:27.850 --> 1:11:30.686
All right, keep working.
Cuz, it's on you.

1:11:30.786 --> 1:11:32.354
Let's go, guys.

1:11:34.323 --> 1:11:37.159
You guys are late. Let's go.
Move, move, move.

1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:40.429
I like that. I like the visor.

1:11:40.496 --> 1:11:41.930
Are you eating that?

1:11:41.997 --> 1:11:43.365
You put crap like that
in your mouth,

1:11:43.465 --> 1:11:44.700
your game's gonna go south.

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:46.502
-Hey, Barry, which line?
- Line two.

1:11:46.602 --> 1:11:48.270
Line two. Okay.

1:11:50.639 --> 1:11:52.975
This is Rick Macci.

1:11:53.042 --> 1:11:55.678
-

1:11:58.681 --> 1:12:00.816
He's here! He's here!
He's here! He's here!

1:12:00.883 --> 1:12:02.551
Okay, okay.
Relax, relax.

1:12:02.651 --> 1:12:04.219
Everybody, come on,
get in your position.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:05.387
Let's go.

1:12:06.855 --> 1:12:09.658
Mr. Macci.
Welcome, welcome.

1:12:09.725 --> 1:12:11.327
Hello, everybody.

1:12:11.393 --> 1:12:12.661
Hello.
- Hi.

1:12:12.728 --> 1:12:14.697
-I'm Richard Williams.
-Mr. Williams.

1:12:14.797 --> 1:12:16.732
-This my wife. This Brandy.
-Hi, it's an honor.

1:12:16.832 --> 1:12:18.500
-We glad to see you.
-It's great to be here.

1:12:18.567 --> 1:12:19.868
This is all our kids.
This our family.

1:12:19.968 --> 1:12:22.538
That's Venus, Serena,
Tunde, Lyn, Isha.

1:12:22.638 --> 1:12:23.739
Hello.
- Hi.

1:12:23.839 --> 1:12:25.374
Thank you for coming.

1:12:25.474 --> 1:12:26.709
We know you came a long way,
so we won't waste your time.

1:12:26.809 --> 1:12:28.010
You wanna get on
over to the club?

1:12:28.077 --> 1:12:29.311
Let's get it started.

1:12:29.378 --> 1:12:30.512
Let's get it.
Come on, girls, let's go.

1:12:30.579 --> 1:12:31.914
Mr. Macci a busy man.

1:12:32.014 --> 1:12:33.415
-All right.
-Be great, be great.

1:12:33.515 --> 1:12:35.184
Come on, y'all,
let's go. Get on in there.

1:12:36.185 --> 1:12:37.720
Grab the door here.

1:12:41.357 --> 1:12:44.893
So, uh, tell me one more time,
which one of you is, uh...

1:12:44.993 --> 1:12:46.929
Big one, Venus.
Little one, Serena.

1:12:47.029 --> 1:12:49.565
Okay.
I think I can handle that.

1:12:53.435 --> 1:12:55.504
Oh, don't worry about that.
You don't need that.

1:12:59.708 --> 1:13:00.909
Bye, guys!

1:13:04.913 --> 1:13:06.782
We got Rick Macci
in Compton!

1:13:08.884 --> 1:13:11.019
Good. There you go, Meka.

1:13:11.086 --> 1:13:12.955
Take that. And that.

1:13:13.055 --> 1:13:14.289
Close her down, Richard?

1:13:14.390 --> 1:13:16.525
Uh, yeah,
you can just close it up.

1:13:23.932 --> 1:13:25.200
Hey, hey, hey!

1:13:25.267 --> 1:13:28.103
Slow down, haircut.
Hell you think you going?

1:13:29.972 --> 1:13:32.775
Oh. Just gonna
play some tennis.

1:13:32.875 --> 1:13:34.143
Hey, yo, Richard,

1:13:34.243 --> 1:13:36.211
this Jimmy Connors-looking
cracker with you?

1:13:36.278 --> 1:13:38.213
Uh, yeah, yeah.
White boy with us.

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:39.648
All right, it's spoke.

1:13:39.748 --> 1:13:41.283
-Yeah, he just White.
- It's spoke.

1:13:41.383 --> 1:13:42.985
Amen.

1:13:43.085 --> 1:13:44.319
Get up out of here.

1:13:44.420 --> 1:13:45.654
I ain't gonna
let you get shot, Rick.

1:13:45.754 --> 1:13:46.955
Appreciate it.

1:13:48.490 --> 1:13:51.059
-This is it, huh?
- This it.

1:13:51.126 --> 1:13:52.795
Compton Country Club.

1:13:54.129 --> 1:13:55.964
Really good,
really good, really good.

1:13:58.233 --> 1:14:00.669
They ain't gonna hit you.
They ain't gonna hit you.

1:14:00.769 --> 1:14:02.271
Go get it. Forehand.

1:14:02.337 --> 1:14:04.606
-Pop. Excellent. Backhand.

1:14:04.673 --> 1:14:05.774
Attagirl, go!

1:14:05.841 --> 1:14:07.242
Move. Fast feet.
Good recovery.

1:14:07.309 --> 1:14:08.410
Excellent. Recover.

1:14:09.411 --> 1:14:11.346
Wheels, wheels, recover. Go!

1:14:12.481 --> 1:14:14.583
Good! Again!

1:14:14.650 --> 1:14:17.119
Hey, I like it.
Find the slot, rip the shot.

1:14:17.186 --> 1:14:18.520
-That's Rick Macci.
- Again.

1:14:18.620 --> 1:14:20.155
Where you get that power from?

1:14:20.255 --> 1:14:21.590
Macci rhyme with crazy.

1:14:21.657 --> 1:14:23.025
I'm sorry,
was it something I said?

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:24.760
I think it's the 'stache.
I think she doesn't like

1:14:24.827 --> 1:14:26.528
the guy with the 'stache.
Get there.

1:14:26.628 --> 1:14:28.697
I love it. Come on in
for the approach.

1:14:29.665 --> 1:14:32.167
Yes! Come on. Get there.

1:14:32.267 --> 1:14:33.869
What do you say?
Fight it like you're angry.

1:14:33.969 --> 1:14:35.604
Oh, I like it! Excellent work.

1:14:35.671 --> 1:14:38.173
Hey, girls. Hey.
I love what you're doing.

1:14:38.273 --> 1:14:39.675
-Excellent job.
- There you go.

1:14:39.775 --> 1:14:41.877
Put it right there.
Did you guys have fun?

1:14:41.977 --> 1:14:44.346
Yeah.
-Good. Good, good. I like it.

1:14:44.446 --> 1:14:46.381
That father of yours,
he's done a heck of a job,

1:14:46.482 --> 1:14:48.383
so, uh, this was a lot of fun
for me too.

1:14:48.484 --> 1:14:50.452
So, thank you, girls.
Thank you.

1:14:50.519 --> 1:14:53.188
Richard, I'm, uh...
I'm impressed.

1:14:53.288 --> 1:14:55.724
Y'all go get
some water. Get some water.

1:14:55.824 --> 1:14:58.727
They're, uh...
They're terrific, I think.

1:14:58.827 --> 1:15:00.062
I think you might just have

1:15:00.162 --> 1:15:01.997
the next Michael Jordan
on your hands.

1:15:02.064 --> 1:15:03.799
Oh, no, brother-man,

1:15:03.866 --> 1:15:06.401
-I gots me the next two.
-

1:15:08.036 --> 1:15:09.972
I like the way you think.

1:15:10.038 --> 1:15:13.742
This here,
this is my standard agreement.

1:15:13.842 --> 1:15:16.912
Same one I used with Jennifer.
All right.

1:15:17.012 --> 1:15:19.248
Instruction, housing,
food, education.

1:15:19.348 --> 1:15:20.916
You don't pay for a thing.

1:15:21.016 --> 1:15:24.520
Even trips to Disney World,
which is right down the road.

1:15:24.586 --> 1:15:27.222
But mostly, it's...
It's my personal time.

1:15:27.322 --> 1:15:28.857
Now, that I promise
you will get.

1:15:28.924 --> 1:15:31.426
You train at Rick Macci,
hey, you're...

1:15:31.527 --> 1:15:32.761
you're gonna train with Rick.

1:15:32.861 --> 1:15:34.863
Sounds expensive.
What's in it for you?

1:15:34.930 --> 1:15:37.733
My fee is 15%
of their future earnings.

1:15:37.833 --> 1:15:39.768
If you make nothing,
I make nothing.

1:15:39.868 --> 1:15:41.937
But, uh,
I can tell you one thing,

1:15:42.037 --> 1:15:43.772
we are not gonna make nothing.

1:15:45.107 --> 1:15:46.875
What you know
about Nick Bollettieri?

1:15:49.011 --> 1:15:51.179
He a real famous, uh,
tennis coach.

1:15:52.781 --> 1:15:54.883
The boy keep calling here.
Can't get him off the phone.

1:15:54.950 --> 1:15:57.019
Yeah, Nick is a...
He's a good coach.

1:15:57.085 --> 1:16:00.355
You know, he's had
a lot of success, but, uh...

1:16:00.422 --> 1:16:02.257
I can tell you now,
you go down to Bradenton

1:16:02.357 --> 1:16:03.959
to train with Nick,
you're not gonna get Nick.

1:16:04.059 --> 1:16:05.294
You're gonna get
whatever hitting coach

1:16:05.394 --> 1:16:06.361
he's got available.

1:16:06.428 --> 1:16:08.397
You're gonna get a factory.

1:16:08.463 --> 1:16:10.265
Now, you train with me,
I'm your coach. It's me.

1:16:10.365 --> 1:16:11.733
A lot of people say
Nick the best.

1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:13.635
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1:16:13.735 --> 1:16:15.037
Remember that man
who said that?

1:16:15.103 --> 1:16:16.872
-Mm-hmm.
- Mr. and Mrs. Williams,

1:16:16.939 --> 1:16:18.807
whether it's Nick or Rick...

1:16:18.907 --> 1:16:20.309
Tom, Dick, or Harry,
it doesn't matter.

1:16:20.409 --> 1:16:22.377
If it's their dream
to be a champion,

1:16:22.444 --> 1:16:23.645
well, then you got a chance.

1:16:23.745 --> 1:16:25.314
But, you know,
if it's yours, mine, no.

1:16:25.414 --> 1:16:27.983
Crash and burn.
It's not gonna happen.

1:16:28.083 --> 1:16:30.118
So, you wanna go with Nick,

1:16:30.218 --> 1:16:31.987
you know,
you gotta go with Nick.

1:16:32.087 --> 1:16:33.088
That's your prerogative.

1:16:33.155 --> 1:16:34.423
No, we wanna go with you.

1:16:34.489 --> 1:16:35.791
Oh.
-

1:16:35.891 --> 1:16:37.626
Thank heavens.
I was...

1:16:37.726 --> 1:16:39.394
We just wanted to hear you say
what you had said.

1:16:39.461 --> 1:16:40.729
Well, well done.

1:16:40.796 --> 1:16:43.065
- Whew!

1:16:43.131 --> 1:16:45.634
-Hey, Tunde. Uh...
- Wow.

1:16:45.734 --> 1:16:48.337
Now, this here
is our standard agreement.

1:16:48.437 --> 1:16:50.906
I'm sorry, your...

1:16:50.973 --> 1:16:52.741
You know,
you take these girls,

1:16:52.808 --> 1:16:54.843
you take us all,
the whole family.

1:16:56.778 --> 1:17:00.015
I'm sorry, you...
You all wanna come to Florida?

1:17:00.115 --> 1:17:01.416
Not Tunde.

1:17:01.483 --> 1:17:04.019
She just graduated
valedictorian.

1:17:04.119 --> 1:17:05.787
So, her life is here.

1:17:05.854 --> 1:17:07.589
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.

1:17:07.656 --> 1:17:09.691
Yeah, but all that other stuff
that's in that contract,

1:17:09.791 --> 1:17:11.026
we need that.

1:17:11.126 --> 1:17:12.694
Uh, we need a house,
we need the best school,

1:17:12.794 --> 1:17:16.198
and, uh, a job for me
on your staff.

1:17:16.298 --> 1:17:18.967
It says here, a...
a mobile home?

1:17:19.034 --> 1:17:21.536
Yeah, I mean, we got
to get there, don't we?

1:17:22.704 --> 1:17:24.640
You believe in these kids
or what?

1:17:27.609 --> 1:17:29.444
I swear to you two.
You bet I do.

1:17:29.511 --> 1:17:31.179
Okay, then why are we
still sitting here?

1:17:31.279 --> 1:17:33.115
-We supposed to be in Florida.
- What are we doing?

1:17:33.181 --> 1:17:34.349
Let's go to Florida.

1:17:37.119 --> 1:17:39.888
Bound for nowhere

1:17:42.824 --> 1:17:44.860
To sleep

1:17:46.395 --> 1:17:48.664
No, 'cause you always
take the longest.

1:17:48.730 --> 1:17:49.898
Oh, thank you.

1:17:49.998 --> 1:17:51.233
Y'all,
can you get me one?

1:17:51.333 --> 1:17:52.668
Here you go.
No, we can share that.

1:17:52.734 --> 1:17:54.302
-We can share now.
- Give me one.

1:17:54.369 --> 1:17:55.470
No. 'Cause y'all
wouldn't let me sit with you.

1:17:55.537 --> 1:17:56.738
Keep your hands...

1:17:56.838 --> 1:17:58.073
You keep your hand
on that wheel.

1:17:58.173 --> 1:17:59.474
She got it.
Do you need me, Junior?

1:17:59.541 --> 1:18:00.842
No, I got it.
-Put one hand,

1:18:00.909 --> 1:18:02.144
at least one hand
on that wheel. Something.

1:18:02.210 --> 1:18:03.645
What's up?
Hey, police.

1:18:03.712 --> 1:18:05.047
Hi, police!
- We were just

1:18:05.147 --> 1:18:06.815
-breaking the law. Sorry.
-

1:18:06.882 --> 1:18:09.751
-Okay, spell "Albuquerque."
-Albuquerque.

1:18:09.851 --> 1:18:13.522
A-L-B-U-Q...

1:18:13.588 --> 1:18:14.723
No.
- Yeah.

1:18:14.823 --> 1:18:16.024
-Can't be L-R.

1:18:16.091 --> 1:18:18.193
It started...
- A-L...

1:18:18.260 --> 1:18:19.928
-The word got, like...
-A-L-B-U-Q...

1:18:20.028 --> 1:18:21.196
...it got, like, three Q's.

1:18:21.263 --> 1:18:22.898
No, don't tell 'em.
Let 'em do it.

1:18:28.704 --> 1:18:31.406
Deathly quiet

1:18:31.506 --> 1:18:33.875
All expression

1:18:33.942 --> 1:18:36.545
Play the game, boy

1:18:36.611 --> 1:18:39.715
To play it right
You got to

1:18:42.784 --> 1:18:48.256
Know when to walk away

1:18:53.028 --> 1:18:55.297
At the table

1:18:55.397 --> 1:18:59.134
For counting

1:19:05.373 --> 1:19:07.109
Look at that.
We in Florida.

1:19:07.209 --> 1:19:08.477
So pretty!

1:19:08.577 --> 1:19:09.644
There you go.
Welcome to Florida.

1:19:11.713 --> 1:19:13.215
Rick Macci,
here we come.

1:19:13.281 --> 1:19:15.283
Rick Macci,
there we go.

1:19:24.392 --> 1:19:25.494
There they are.

1:19:25.594 --> 1:19:26.995
Hi.
-Wow, look at that.

1:19:27.095 --> 1:19:30.465
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the Sunshine State.

1:19:30.565 --> 1:19:32.234
Gosh, it's great
to see you guys.

1:19:32.300 --> 1:19:33.568
How was the trip? Was it good?

1:19:33.635 --> 1:19:34.770
Yeah. It was long.

1:19:34.836 --> 1:19:36.304
Long?
Yeah, I bet it was.

1:19:36.404 --> 1:19:37.973
It wasn't long.
It was not long.

1:19:38.073 --> 1:19:39.641
Richard, do you see
that blue bad boy right there?

1:19:39.741 --> 1:19:41.076
Mm-hmm.
-I call it the Comet.

1:19:41.143 --> 1:19:42.244
I like to ride around,

1:19:42.310 --> 1:19:43.745
makes me feel like
I own the place.

1:19:43.812 --> 1:19:45.747
Which is crazy 'cause,
you know, I kinda do.

1:19:45.814 --> 1:19:47.082
That gonna be mine.

1:19:47.149 --> 1:19:48.583
-That gonna be mine.
- Now, girls,

1:19:48.650 --> 1:19:50.018
these are the drilling courts.
That's Tommy Ho.

1:19:50.118 --> 1:19:51.486
He won the U.S.
Junior Nationals at 15.

1:19:51.586 --> 1:19:53.155
He's top 50 in the country.

1:19:53.255 --> 1:19:55.423
That's Eric Taino.
That's John Roddick.

1:19:55.490 --> 1:19:56.958
They're both top five
in the country

1:19:57.025 --> 1:19:58.426
right now for their age group.

1:19:58.493 --> 1:19:59.628
Now, John, he's got

1:19:59.694 --> 1:20:01.163
-a little brother.
-Yeah, he's good.

1:20:01.263 --> 1:20:02.330
His name's Andy.
That kid is a savage.

1:20:02.430 --> 1:20:03.498
He breathes fire. He's good.

1:20:03.598 --> 1:20:04.966
Wait till I get
my hands on him.

1:20:05.033 --> 1:20:06.368
This is it right here.
Let's go.

1:20:06.468 --> 1:20:08.136
-Dig, dig, dig, dig. Feet.
-

1:20:08.203 --> 1:20:09.437
You hear that sound?

1:20:09.504 --> 1:20:11.106
That sound is effort.
I love effort.

1:20:11.173 --> 1:20:13.642
That's my happy place.
Come with me.

1:20:13.708 --> 1:20:15.310
This is where we eat.

1:20:15.377 --> 1:20:17.045
Hey, guys, don't eat too many
of these things, all right?

1:20:17.145 --> 1:20:19.214
This will give you horns.

1:20:19.314 --> 1:20:20.649
Best French fries in Florida.

1:20:20.715 --> 1:20:22.184
Now, look, this place
will always be open

1:20:22.284 --> 1:20:23.518
and available to you guys.

1:20:23.618 --> 1:20:24.820
You help yourselves
whenever you want.

1:20:24.886 --> 1:20:26.354
All right, good,
'cause I'm hungry.

1:20:26.454 --> 1:20:28.023
For real? We just ate.

1:20:28.123 --> 1:20:29.324
You got some place here, Rick.

1:20:29.391 --> 1:20:30.959
And it just got
a lot better today.

1:20:31.026 --> 1:20:32.727
-Come on, Richard, let's go.

1:20:32.828 --> 1:20:34.229
Over here.
Look at 'em walking off.

1:20:34.329 --> 1:20:36.698
Try the cinnamon rolls.
They're first class.

1:20:37.966 --> 1:20:39.067
What you got over there?

1:20:39.167 --> 1:20:41.069
-That's the chum?
-

1:20:41.169 --> 1:20:43.071
Yeah, you know,
you got a good eye, Richard.

1:20:43.171 --> 1:20:44.906
-Mm-hmm.
-You know how that works.

1:20:45.006 --> 1:20:47.909
You need a few cheeseburgers
to pay for the sirloin.

1:20:48.009 --> 1:20:49.411
You sell enough sirloin,

1:20:49.511 --> 1:20:50.645
you can get
to the filet mignon.

1:20:50.712 --> 1:20:52.547
-Oh, there you go.
-

1:20:52.647 --> 1:20:55.183
Here we are, girls.
This is Mecca.

1:20:55.250 --> 1:20:57.752
These two courts here,
they're yours.

1:20:57.853 --> 1:20:59.921
Just you and me
and the best pros we got.

1:21:00.021 --> 1:21:02.424
This is where we hit the horn,
we pop the corn,

1:21:02.524 --> 1:21:05.427
and when we pop it, we pop
with extra butter, right?

1:21:05.527 --> 1:21:06.595
-Right.
-Huh? You feel me?

1:21:06.695 --> 1:21:07.996
-Yep.
- Yeah? Bang.

1:21:08.063 --> 1:21:09.164
-Bang.
- Right? Bang.

1:21:10.532 --> 1:21:12.067
Now, look, I got
a little surprise for you.

1:21:12.167 --> 1:21:15.370
This won't happen every day,
but since she's here,

1:21:15.437 --> 1:21:18.173
I thought maybe
you'd wanna hit a little bit.

1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:20.442
Jennifer!

1:21:20.542 --> 1:21:21.610
Oh, look.

1:21:21.710 --> 1:21:24.045
-That Jennifer Capriati.
- Hey.

1:21:24.112 --> 1:21:26.848
I hear you guys can play.
You wanna hit?

1:21:26.915 --> 1:21:28.049
Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:21:28.116 --> 1:21:29.451
-Can we?
- Oh, yeah.

1:21:29.551 --> 1:21:30.852
You girls just take it easy
on her though.

1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:34.022
Let's go, Meka.
-Have fun, girls.

1:21:34.089 --> 1:21:36.191
This is
really special. Have fun.

1:21:36.258 --> 1:21:37.459
This is special
for her, too.

1:21:37.559 --> 1:21:39.294
I told her
all about the girls,

1:21:39.394 --> 1:21:40.762
and she wanted to meet Venus,
so, yeah.

1:21:40.862 --> 1:21:42.530
Yeah, you know
how to throw a party.

1:21:43.765 --> 1:21:45.100
Well, it's good
you guys are here.

1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:46.902
Nice to meet you.
-Hey, girls.

1:21:46.968 --> 1:21:49.137
All right, girls,
let's go. Warm up slow.

1:21:49.237 --> 1:21:50.472
Just have fun.

1:21:50.572 --> 1:21:52.574
Look at that.
That's gotta be

1:21:52.641 --> 1:21:54.309
-special for her, huh?
- Yeah.

1:21:54.409 --> 1:21:56.711
-She looks strong.
-She is. She is.

1:21:56.778 --> 1:21:58.546
-A lot of work she's put in.
-Mm-hmm.

1:21:58.613 --> 1:21:59.714
So, she's gonna
get there.

1:21:59.781 --> 1:22:01.816
V's gonna get there.

1:22:01.917 --> 1:22:04.819
That's it. Attagirl.
Good. I like it.

1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:07.989
I mean, look at that.
That's the model right there.

1:22:08.089 --> 1:22:10.592
Now, I figure we mold her
in Jennifer's path.

1:22:10.659 --> 1:22:12.894
We start with the Easter Bowl,
then the Orange Bowl,

1:22:12.961 --> 1:22:14.095
just like how Jennifer did it,

1:22:14.162 --> 1:22:15.497
-right?
-Yeah.

1:22:15.597 --> 1:22:17.299
They're good tournaments,
they're challenging.

1:22:17.399 --> 1:22:20.268
I'm thinking we not gonna play
the Easter Bowl though, Rick.

1:22:20.335 --> 1:22:23.405
Okay, well, you got
another tournament in mind?

1:22:25.173 --> 1:22:26.775
No, uh,

1:22:26.841 --> 1:22:28.109
I meant to tell you, uh,

1:22:28.176 --> 1:22:30.612
we not playing
no more Juniors.

1:22:30.679 --> 1:22:33.915
Yeah, they'll play matches
again when they turn pro.

1:22:34.950 --> 1:22:36.518
Okay.

1:22:36.618 --> 1:22:38.987
And when exactly is that
gonna be, Richard?

1:22:40.088 --> 1:22:42.123
When I say they ready.

1:22:42.190 --> 1:22:43.258
We're not gonna
rush this, Rick.

1:22:43.325 --> 1:22:44.426
Everything going good.

1:22:44.492 --> 1:22:46.628
We not gonna
start rushing now.

1:22:46.695 --> 1:22:48.363
What are they gonna do,
Richard?

1:22:48.463 --> 1:22:49.864
They gonna play ping-pong?

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:51.533
No, no.
They gonna practice with you.

1:22:51.633 --> 1:22:54.269
They gonna go to school,
they gonna go to the Hall,

1:22:54.336 --> 1:22:56.137
and pretty much,
they gonna be kids.

1:22:56.204 --> 1:22:57.205
That's what I want.

1:22:57.305 --> 1:22:58.673
They're gonna be kids?

1:22:58.773 --> 1:23:01.376
But, Richard, that's...
That is not how it works.

1:23:01.476 --> 1:23:03.378
I... I... I can't do that.

1:23:03.478 --> 1:23:05.113
I can't mold her like that.

1:23:05.180 --> 1:23:06.348
You need to play Juniors.

1:23:06.448 --> 1:23:07.882
Look, there's not
a single player,

1:23:07.983 --> 1:23:10.151
not one on the pro tour,
that didn't play Juniors.

1:23:10.218 --> 1:23:12.620
Without Juniors,
it's impossible.

1:23:12.687 --> 1:23:16.057
Well, not for you.
Not for you. You Rick Macci.

1:23:16.157 --> 1:23:17.692
That's why we drove
all this way.

1:23:17.792 --> 1:23:21.129
Nothing is impossible
for Rick Macci.

1:23:21.196 --> 1:23:22.330
But if you think
you can't do it,

1:23:22.397 --> 1:23:24.532
we... we can go talk to Nick.

1:23:27.702 --> 1:23:31.039
You know, you might have
mentioned this in Compton.

1:23:31.139 --> 1:23:32.540
I probably could have,

1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:33.975
but then
you wouldn't have made

1:23:34.042 --> 1:23:36.745
the best decision
you ever made in your life.

1:23:38.546 --> 1:23:40.215
This is great, Rick.

1:23:40.315 --> 1:23:42.517
Oh, and I need 'em hitting
open-stance strokes.

1:23:42.584 --> 1:23:44.085
That's one of the things.
That's the most important.

1:23:44.185 --> 1:23:45.920
They got to hit
them open-stance strokes.

1:23:46.021 --> 1:23:47.389
We gonna make it go "boom"
like you said.

1:23:47.489 --> 1:23:48.690
-Remember?
-Right.

1:23:48.757 --> 1:23:50.425
-Make it go boom.
-Yeah, I said "bang,"

1:23:50.525 --> 1:23:51.893
-but, yeah.
-You said, "bang," "boom,"

1:23:51.993 --> 1:23:53.328
we gonna make 'em
make some noise.

1:23:53.395 --> 1:23:54.763
I got to get the family.
They need to see this.

1:23:54.863 --> 1:23:55.930
I'mma grab a burger.
You want something?

1:23:56.031 --> 1:23:58.700
Nah. I don't want a burger.

1:23:58.767 --> 1:24:00.602
Don't be scared, Rick.
I wrote the plan.

1:24:00.702 --> 1:24:02.404
Oh, God, the plan.

1:24:05.874 --> 1:24:07.942
All right, Venus, serve it up.

1:24:22.223 --> 1:24:24.726
Good! Hey, look at that.

1:24:24.793 --> 1:24:26.961
Boom! I like it.
How about that?

1:24:27.062 --> 1:24:28.129
Bang!

1:24:28.229 --> 1:24:29.697
Come on, get in there and dig!

1:24:29.764 --> 1:24:31.299
Kill it. I like it. Good.

1:24:31.399 --> 1:24:33.068
Good, good. Hey, listen.

1:24:33.134 --> 1:24:35.370
That wasn't a good shot
at the end. You know why?

1:24:35.437 --> 1:24:37.072
-It was excellent.
-'Cause it was excellent.

1:24:37.138 --> 1:24:39.707
Good. Hey, I'm proud of ya.
Excellent work.

1:24:39.774 --> 1:24:40.975
Let's go.
I'll race you to the water.

1:24:41.076 --> 1:24:42.577
You've faced
a lot of criticism

1:24:42.644 --> 1:24:44.145
in the last three years since
you pulled your daughters

1:24:44.245 --> 1:24:45.613
out of
Junior tournament tennis.

1:24:45.713 --> 1:24:46.748
-Mm-hmm.
-You've been called

1:24:46.815 --> 1:24:48.750
controversial, overbearing,

1:24:48.817 --> 1:24:51.453
-a self-promoting distraction.
-Mm-hmm.

1:24:51.553 --> 1:24:53.555
How do you respond
to all that?

1:24:53.621 --> 1:24:55.123
Well, look, peoples gonna say

1:24:55.223 --> 1:24:56.558
what peoples gonna say,
you know.

1:24:56.624 --> 1:24:57.826
When somebody come to me,

1:24:57.926 --> 1:24:59.394
telling me my daughter so good

1:24:59.461 --> 1:25:02.163
and she, you know, she need
to be playing matches,

1:25:02.263 --> 1:25:04.432
I know the only reason
they see good

1:25:04.499 --> 1:25:06.067
is 'cause they see money.

1:25:06.134 --> 1:25:07.569
And most of the time,

1:25:07.635 --> 1:25:09.471
they see money that can be
going into they pocket.

1:25:09.571 --> 1:25:11.639
But you've certainly said
a lot of provocative things.

1:25:11.739 --> 1:25:13.141
-Mm-hmm.
-You've said "tennis parents

1:25:13.241 --> 1:25:14.509
-"should be shot."
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

1:25:14.609 --> 1:25:16.411
You said you're brokering
a deal to purchase

1:25:16.478 --> 1:25:18.813
-Rockefeller Center.
-Yep.

1:25:18.913 --> 1:25:21.516
Well, truth is, I got
so many businesses now,

1:25:21.616 --> 1:25:23.351
I hardly even think
about tennis.

1:25:23.451 --> 1:25:25.620
And you're not concerned
all that's holding them back?

1:25:25.687 --> 1:25:27.288
Most top prospects their age,

1:25:27.355 --> 1:25:29.023
like Martina Hingis,
for example,

1:25:29.124 --> 1:25:30.625
-are about to turn pro.
-Yeah.

1:25:30.692 --> 1:25:34.095
But your daughters haven't
played a match since 1991.

1:25:34.162 --> 1:25:36.297
Well, we still
pushing 'em forward.

1:25:36.364 --> 1:25:38.967
Venus speaking four languages.

1:25:39.033 --> 1:25:41.369
Most of 'em fluently, almost.

1:25:41.469 --> 1:25:43.304
How many languages you speak?

1:25:43.371 --> 1:25:46.674
Exactly. Not even
really good at this one.

1:25:46.774 --> 1:25:48.810
Look, I've been broke
all my life,

1:25:48.877 --> 1:25:51.713
and Venus don't wanna be poor,
you know.

1:25:51.813 --> 1:25:53.715
But we not gonna let
nobody push our daughter

1:25:53.815 --> 1:25:55.717
into nothing
she ain't ready for.

1:25:57.218 --> 1:25:58.353
Okay, all right,

1:25:58.453 --> 1:25:59.988
-so, I'mma get Venus.
-Thank you.

1:26:00.054 --> 1:26:01.789
Uh, y'all can go ahead
and move and set up up top.

1:26:01.856 --> 1:26:03.491
-Okay.
- Fast feet. Fast feet.

1:26:03.558 --> 1:26:05.059
Fast feet.
Good. Here they come.

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:06.794
Here's it come. You don't know
when it's coming.

1:26:06.861 --> 1:26:08.696
Let's go. You don't know.
Go! React.

1:26:08.796 --> 1:26:10.498
Good! I like it.
Let's go. Move.

1:26:10.565 --> 1:26:12.534
Yes, like a bullet.
Yes, I like it!

1:26:12.634 --> 1:26:14.369
Boom, that's major league.
Let's go. Fast feet.

1:26:14.469 --> 1:26:15.737
-Fast feet. Keep 'em moving.
-Junior!

1:26:15.837 --> 1:26:17.238
When you're moving,
I'm grooving.

1:26:17.338 --> 1:26:18.706
-Good. Get there.
-Junior!

1:26:18.806 --> 1:26:22.143
You got an interview.
Come on, let's go.

1:26:22.210 --> 1:26:25.747
Come on.
Hey, V, we got two more hours.

1:26:25.847 --> 1:26:27.248
Hey, look,
I'm telling you now,

1:26:27.348 --> 1:26:29.050
you leave this court,
your sister's taking over.

1:26:29.150 --> 1:26:30.685
Sorry, Rick, it's showtime.

1:26:30.752 --> 1:26:33.388
Yeah, it's always showtime,
isn't it, Richard?

1:26:34.355 --> 1:26:35.757
Hey, Meek, let's go.

1:26:35.857 --> 1:26:37.992
I know someone
wants to be here.

1:26:38.059 --> 1:26:39.894
Do you wanna turn pro?

1:26:39.994 --> 1:26:41.095
Yes.

1:26:41.196 --> 1:26:42.497
A lot of people
are excited to see

1:26:42.564 --> 1:26:45.033
how you'd do
against players like Seles.

1:26:45.099 --> 1:26:47.268
Do you think you can beat her?

1:26:47.368 --> 1:26:48.770
I know I could beat her.

1:26:48.870 --> 1:26:52.373
You know you can beat her?
Very confident.

1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:53.741
I'm very confident.

1:26:54.776 --> 1:26:58.079
You say it so easily. Why?

1:26:59.547 --> 1:27:01.015
Because I believe it.

1:27:01.082 --> 1:27:03.117
But you haven't played a match
in almost three years.

1:27:03.218 --> 1:27:04.919
All right,
hold it right there.

1:27:05.019 --> 1:27:06.554
If you don't mind,
lemme tell you why.

1:27:06.621 --> 1:27:08.389
Richard,
we're doing an interview.

1:27:08.456 --> 1:27:09.891
Well, what she had said,

1:27:09.958 --> 1:27:12.460
she said it with so much
confidence the first time,

1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:13.795
but you keep going on and on.

1:27:13.895 --> 1:27:15.296
But you can't
just keep interrupting.

1:27:15.396 --> 1:27:17.131
What you gots to understand
is you're dealing

1:27:17.232 --> 1:27:19.867
with the image
of a 14-year-old child.

1:27:19.934 --> 1:27:21.302
And this child
gonna be playing

1:27:21.402 --> 1:27:24.439
when your old ass and me
gonna be in the grave.

1:27:24.539 --> 1:27:25.573
When she had said something,

1:27:25.640 --> 1:27:26.908
we done told you
what's happening.

1:27:26.975 --> 1:27:29.544
You are dealing
with a little Black kid.

1:27:29.611 --> 1:27:30.912
Let her be a kid.

1:27:30.979 --> 1:27:32.914
Now, she done answered it
with a lot of confidence.

1:27:32.981 --> 1:27:34.949
Leave that alone!

1:27:37.952 --> 1:27:39.887
Focus. That's it.
It's all about your eyes.

1:27:39.954 --> 1:27:42.390
Focus. Right there.
Good. Turn it over.

1:27:42.457 --> 1:27:44.425
Good. Sharp. Again.

1:27:44.492 --> 1:27:47.762
Again. Sharp. Let's go.
One, two, right there.

1:27:47.829 --> 1:27:50.331
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1:27:50.431 --> 1:27:52.634
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1:27:52.734 --> 1:27:54.636
Let's go. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Fast feet.

1:27:54.736 --> 1:27:56.170
What's going on, Shakespeare?

1:27:56.271 --> 1:27:57.505
Good.

1:27:57.605 --> 1:27:59.474
-Did you get the part?
-Yeah, it was good.

1:28:00.908 --> 1:28:02.577
Rick, what's going on
over there?

1:28:02.644 --> 1:28:05.179
Eh, big Junior tournament's
coming up.

1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:07.949
The Continental Cup.
Hoopla's for Kournikova.

1:28:08.016 --> 1:28:09.083
She's getting
some practice in.

1:28:09.150 --> 1:28:10.518
Again. Go take a break.

1:28:10.618 --> 1:28:12.020
I heard she's going pro
next month in Russia.

1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:14.656
-Hingis announced, too.
-Yeah, they, uh...

1:28:14.756 --> 1:28:15.657
They are.

1:28:15.757 --> 1:28:17.659
But look, Russia's overrated.

1:28:17.759 --> 1:28:19.594
The weather's lousy,
the food's terrible...

1:28:19.661 --> 1:28:21.629
-But, Rick, I wanna play.
-

1:28:21.696 --> 1:28:23.598
Sweetheart, you're preaching
to the choir, okay?

1:28:23.665 --> 1:28:25.533
-Do you think I'm ready?
-No, I know you're ready.

1:28:25.633 --> 1:28:27.635
Okay, will you talk to my dad?

1:28:27.702 --> 1:28:29.370
Sweetheart, look...
-Come on, Rick, please.

1:28:29.470 --> 1:28:30.805
You're trying to feed me
to the wolves here.

1:28:30.872 --> 1:28:32.040
I'm ready. You know I'm ready.

1:28:32.140 --> 1:28:33.308
Look, I've been
down this road...

1:28:33.374 --> 1:28:35.343
Rick, just talk to him.
Please.

1:28:35.443 --> 1:28:36.544
Eh...

1:28:36.644 --> 1:28:37.945
Please?

1:28:38.012 --> 1:28:39.280
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1:28:39.347 --> 1:28:40.782
Is that a yes?

1:28:40.848 --> 1:28:42.550
It's that face.
It's your face.

1:28:42.650 --> 1:28:43.685
It's like I can't...

1:28:43.785 --> 1:28:44.719
-So, yes?
-You give me the face...

1:28:44.819 --> 1:28:45.953
-Yes, yes.
-Yes!

1:28:46.020 --> 1:28:47.188
All right,
all right, all right.

1:28:47.288 --> 1:28:48.856
-Yes!
-Oh, boy. Here we go.

1:28:48.956 --> 1:28:50.391
-Let's just...
-It's a yes.

1:28:50.491 --> 1:28:51.993
...hope he doesn't actually
kill the messenger.

1:28:52.060 --> 1:28:54.062
He said yeah?
-He said yes.

1:28:54.162 --> 1:28:55.396
Jesus.

1:28:55.496 --> 1:28:58.032
Think fast. Put those on,
train your sister.

1:28:58.132 --> 1:28:59.300
I need a break to figure out

1:28:59.367 --> 1:29:00.868
how I'm gonna talk
to this maniac.

1:29:00.968 --> 1:29:02.737
-Let's go. Put your gloves on.
-Let's go.

1:29:04.138 --> 1:29:05.807
The main reason
we not rushing,

1:29:05.873 --> 1:29:09.077
'cause without an education,
no matter how good you are,

1:29:09.177 --> 1:29:11.079
by the time they 18,
they gonna be broke,

1:29:11.179 --> 1:29:13.481
then have 50 more years
to live like a fool.

1:29:13.548 --> 1:29:14.916
We not doing that.

1:29:15.016 --> 1:29:16.584
-Oh, look at that.
-What's going on, everybody?

1:29:16.684 --> 1:29:18.419
There's Rick Macci.
- Kids, where...

1:29:18.519 --> 1:29:21.422
Rick own everything you see
as far as you can see.

1:29:21.522 --> 1:29:23.057
True. Hey, Richard,

1:29:23.157 --> 1:29:25.827
do you think I could, um,
bend your ear for a minute?

1:29:25.893 --> 1:29:27.362
Oh, yeah, yeah,
sure thing.

1:29:27.428 --> 1:29:29.397
Uh, girls, take the kids on
down to the court.

1:29:29.497 --> 1:29:30.932
I'll meet you down there.

1:29:31.032 --> 1:29:31.866
You can go on with them.
I'll talk to you in a second.

1:29:31.933 --> 1:29:32.867
Okay. Thank you.

1:29:32.934 --> 1:29:34.435
Rick got that look on his face

1:29:34.535 --> 1:29:36.037
like he need
to say something to me

1:29:36.104 --> 1:29:37.538
that I'm not gonna wanna hear.

1:29:37.605 --> 1:29:39.173
Have fun. Have fun, kids.
You got great teachers.

1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.775
Yeah, come on, lemme give you
a ride in your cart.

1:29:40.875 --> 1:29:42.377
She got the fire in her eye,
that one.

1:29:42.443 --> 1:29:44.746
Thank you. I miss this sucker.

1:29:44.846 --> 1:29:46.781
Richard, there's, uh...

1:29:46.881 --> 1:29:49.283
There's a tournament
in Oakland coming up.

1:29:49.384 --> 1:29:50.785
It's called
the Bank of the West.

1:29:50.885 --> 1:29:53.388
Now, I called the director.

1:29:53.454 --> 1:29:54.789
He said they'd, uh,

1:29:54.889 --> 1:29:56.858
give Venus a wild card
if we committed now.

1:29:56.924 --> 1:29:58.693
Also, my friend Patrick,
he's from Nike,

1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:00.728
he's gonna be there, and
he's available for a sit-down.

1:30:00.795 --> 1:30:02.230
I don't like that.
I don't like that, Rick.

1:30:02.296 --> 1:30:03.765
You don't like what, Richard?
Wait a second.

1:30:03.865 --> 1:30:05.199
Don't talk to peoples
behind my back like that.

1:30:05.266 --> 1:30:06.634
I'm not talking
to anybody behind...

1:30:06.734 --> 1:30:08.202
Don't do that.
You know I don't like that.

1:30:08.269 --> 1:30:09.804
-Don't do that.
-Wait, wait, wait, Richard,

1:30:09.904 --> 1:30:11.205
hang on a second. Will you
just hear me out, please?

1:30:11.272 --> 1:30:13.307
Look, she's...
she's 14 years old.

1:30:13.408 --> 1:30:15.643
Hingis just turned pro.
Kournikova, she's going soon.

1:30:15.743 --> 1:30:18.646
I don't understand why we
would give them a head start.

1:30:18.746 --> 1:30:20.548
Jennifer,
she'd been on the cover

1:30:20.615 --> 1:30:21.983
of a freaking
Wheaties box by now.

1:30:22.083 --> 1:30:23.584
And I know
I'm not supposed to say this,

1:30:23.651 --> 1:30:26.120
but Venus is twice as good
as Jennifer ever was.

1:30:26.220 --> 1:30:27.822
Jennifer just dropped
off the tour.

1:30:29.557 --> 1:30:31.993
She didn't drop off the tour.
She's taking a break, okay?

1:30:32.093 --> 1:30:33.594
-Rick, tell me the truth.
-It's a vacation.

1:30:33.661 --> 1:30:35.096
-I am telling you the truth.
-Peoples are saying

1:30:35.163 --> 1:30:36.631
-that she burnt out.
-She's not burnt out.

1:30:36.731 --> 1:30:38.332
Richard, Jennifer is fine,
but you know what?

1:30:38.433 --> 1:30:39.767
So is Venus.

1:30:39.834 --> 1:30:42.170
Come on, man.
Look, she's ready.

1:30:42.270 --> 1:30:43.504
Hold your racket
like this.

1:30:43.604 --> 1:30:44.972
Let's get this show
on the road.

1:30:45.072 --> 1:30:46.240
I can see it in her eyes.

1:30:46.307 --> 1:30:48.476
She's hungry.
She's got the fire.

1:30:48.576 --> 1:30:50.945
Come on, Richard.
What do you say?

1:30:51.012 --> 1:30:52.447
Did she send you up here
to talk to me?

1:30:52.513 --> 1:30:54.348
-You're gonna beat me?
-I'm gonna hit it now.

1:30:54.449 --> 1:30:56.918
Look,
it's not just my idea.

1:30:58.319 --> 1:31:00.955
Rick, I don't say this
to you too often...

1:31:01.022 --> 1:31:04.125
-Okay.
-...but you are not wrong.

1:31:04.826 --> 1:31:06.127
So, does that...

1:31:06.194 --> 1:31:07.195
But that's all you're getting
from me today.

1:31:07.295 --> 1:31:08.329
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:31:08.429 --> 1:31:09.864
Just let me think about it.

1:31:09.964 --> 1:31:11.365
-All right.

1:31:11.466 --> 1:31:12.700
Thank you for your time,
Richard.

1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:14.202
Mm.

1:31:14.302 --> 1:31:16.471
Uh, you can borrow
your cart if you want.

1:31:16.537 --> 1:31:18.439
No, that's okay, Richard,
you hang onto it.

1:31:18.506 --> 1:31:19.707
It looks great on you.

1:31:19.807 --> 1:31:21.209
No, just have it back
in 40 minutes.

1:31:21.309 --> 1:31:22.877
Okay.

1:31:22.977 --> 1:31:25.112
- Oh, my gosh.

1:31:25.179 --> 1:31:26.981
...far more than expected.

1:31:27.048 --> 1:31:29.050
It doesn't look like
the tide will turn back

1:31:29.150 --> 1:31:31.619
in the favor of drivers
in the near future...

1:31:31.686 --> 1:31:33.120
-Thank you.
-Here you go, sir.

1:31:33.187 --> 1:31:34.889
My wife think I got
a girlfriend down here,

1:31:34.989 --> 1:31:37.058
I be coming to get
your burgers so much.

1:31:37.158 --> 1:31:39.393
She don't know
I'm cheating on her cooking.

1:31:39.494 --> 1:31:42.129
Michael Williams
has that story from Miami.

1:31:42.196 --> 1:31:44.065
Jennifer Capriati now faces

1:31:44.165 --> 1:31:45.900
her most serious court battle.

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:47.401
The 18-year-old was arrested

1:31:47.502 --> 1:31:50.404
after police showed up
at her Coral Gables hotel room

1:31:50.505 --> 1:31:52.240
to check a tip
about a runaway.

1:31:52.340 --> 1:31:55.409
They say that they found
a small amount of marijuana.

1:31:55.510 --> 1:31:58.312
Police say a runaway girl
and a 19-year-old man

1:31:58.379 --> 1:32:00.348
did show up
at Capriati's room.

1:32:00.414 --> 1:32:02.583
They were arrested
on charges of heroin

1:32:02.683 --> 1:32:06.053
and suspected
crack cocaine possession.

1:32:06.153 --> 1:32:08.422
Let's go!

1:32:08.523 --> 1:32:09.690
What do you say?
What do you say?

1:32:09.757 --> 1:32:11.592
Time to get sharp for the Bay.

1:32:11.692 --> 1:32:13.828
Little steps, big results.

1:32:13.895 --> 1:32:18.032
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

1:32:18.099 --> 1:32:20.101
Come on, guys, somebody say
something. What's going on?

1:32:20.201 --> 1:32:22.103
-They're at Disney World.
-They're what?

1:32:22.203 --> 1:32:23.538
They're at Disney World.

1:32:23.604 --> 1:32:25.706
Richard said practice
is cancelled for today.

1:32:27.375 --> 1:32:28.943
Ah, you gotta be...

1:32:36.250 --> 1:32:37.718
There go Rick.
There go Rick.

1:32:37.785 --> 1:32:39.687
Hey, Richard.
- Hey, Rick.

1:32:46.894 --> 1:32:48.095
-Okay, let's go.
- Come on.

1:32:48.195 --> 1:32:49.797
Homework, homework.
You got homework.

1:32:49.897 --> 1:32:51.566
Hello, everybody.
-Hey!

1:32:51.632 --> 1:32:53.968
-You guys have a good time?
-I rode on Space Mountain.

1:32:54.068 --> 1:32:55.870
-Did ya? Were you scared?
-I was not scared.

1:32:55.937 --> 1:32:57.538
-They were crying like babies.
-

1:32:57.605 --> 1:32:59.206
-I like those ears.
-Don't drop that.

1:32:59.273 --> 1:33:01.809
Richard, Richard, maybe
if I could just get a minute?

1:33:01.909 --> 1:33:03.044
Thank you.

1:33:04.612 --> 1:33:06.080
There was, uh...

1:33:06.147 --> 1:33:08.449
-We had a practice scheduled.
-Uh-huh.

1:33:08.549 --> 1:33:10.751
Tournament's just
a few weeks away, so,

1:33:10.818 --> 1:33:12.253
you know, we gotta practice.

1:33:12.320 --> 1:33:15.723
Yeah, well, I decided we not
playing that tournament.

1:33:15.790 --> 1:33:18.159
Daddy, what?
Why? What happened?

1:33:18.259 --> 1:33:19.760
It's okay, Junior.

1:33:19.827 --> 1:33:21.996
I'm not gonna let him burn
you out like he did Capriati.

1:33:22.096 --> 1:33:23.664
-What?
- I'm... I'm sorry,

1:33:23.764 --> 1:33:25.166
like I did with what?

1:33:25.266 --> 1:33:26.667
Well,
you was her coach, right?

1:33:26.767 --> 1:33:28.069
-Mommy...
-It's all right.

1:33:28.135 --> 1:33:29.470
That's all
you been saying is,

1:33:29.570 --> 1:33:31.105
"Look at Jennifer.
Look at Jennifer."

1:33:31.172 --> 1:33:33.441
Well, we looking. She on TV,
her mugshot. Arrested.

1:33:33.507 --> 1:33:35.910
Venus is not gonna
be cracked out

1:33:35.977 --> 1:33:37.678
in some alley
'cause you pushed her there.

1:33:37.778 --> 1:33:39.447
Come on.
- It's not fair.

1:33:39.513 --> 1:33:41.015
Venus,
don't you get upset.

1:33:41.115 --> 1:33:43.517
Don't you let him
see you upset. Come on.

1:33:43.618 --> 1:33:46.487
You proud of yourself?
Just broke her heart.

1:33:49.023 --> 1:33:51.792
I tell you what, man...

1:33:51.859 --> 1:33:54.662
I'm getting pretty tired
of your games.

1:33:56.263 --> 1:33:57.465
My games? What games?

1:33:57.531 --> 1:33:58.766
These games.

1:33:58.833 --> 1:34:00.601
You showed up here,
first thing you did,

1:34:00.668 --> 1:34:02.103
you pulled 'em out of Juniors.

1:34:02.169 --> 1:34:03.471
Now you pull 'em
out of practice.

1:34:03.537 --> 1:34:04.939
You do it constantly.

1:34:05.006 --> 1:34:07.208
For... For music lessons,
or homework, or church.

1:34:07.308 --> 1:34:09.710
Look, they got to get
straight A's,

1:34:09.810 --> 1:34:11.445
else they can't play tennis.
You knew that.

1:34:11.512 --> 1:34:12.680
I told you that.
That's my rules.

1:34:12.780 --> 1:34:13.981
Well, you pull 'em
out to train

1:34:14.048 --> 1:34:15.449
with other coaches
behind my back?

1:34:17.118 --> 1:34:18.519
I'm trying to round out
they games.

1:34:19.887 --> 1:34:21.522
They not gonna get great
doing the same drills...

1:34:21.622 --> 1:34:22.790
-Thank you.
-...that every other Junior

1:34:22.857 --> 1:34:24.392
in America is doing.

1:34:24.492 --> 1:34:25.860
I'm trying to look out
for my kids.

1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:27.361
No, you're looking out
for yourself.

1:34:27.461 --> 1:34:29.063
You know, all I hear from you
is pressure.

1:34:29.163 --> 1:34:30.865
Pressure, pressure, pressure.

1:34:30.965 --> 1:34:33.567
But you know what I see?
On TV, I see it every day.

1:34:33.668 --> 1:34:35.403
I see
the Richard Williams Show.

1:34:35.503 --> 1:34:38.506
A million dollars. Number one.
The greatest of all time.

1:34:38.572 --> 1:34:40.374
You don't think
that adds pressure?

1:34:40.474 --> 1:34:41.676
It add confidence.

1:34:41.742 --> 1:34:43.744
Nah, that's bullshit.
It's about you.

1:34:43.844 --> 1:34:46.080
Now, look, you wanna jerk
my chain, go on and jerk it.

1:34:46.180 --> 1:34:49.050
But do not do it
to those girls.

1:34:49.150 --> 1:34:52.653
Rick, all respects due,
we love you.

1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:55.656
You... You like a member
of our family.

1:34:55.723 --> 1:34:57.992
But you work for us.

1:34:58.059 --> 1:34:59.760
-I wrote this plan.
-Plan.

1:34:59.860 --> 1:35:01.762
And when I say
she's not playing,

1:35:01.862 --> 1:35:03.731
she is not playing.

1:35:03.831 --> 1:35:05.599
I call the shots.

1:35:05.700 --> 1:35:08.502
And I'm sorry
if you don't like that.

1:35:08.569 --> 1:35:11.172
Richard,
screw your freaking plan.

1:35:11.238 --> 1:35:12.540
You don't know
what you're doing.

1:35:13.874 --> 1:35:15.109
You don't.

1:35:22.049 --> 1:35:24.785
That is a nice house,
by the way.

1:35:24.885 --> 1:35:26.454
Remind me, who pays for that?

1:35:26.554 --> 1:35:30.691
Don't do that. Don't do that.
You're a better man than that.

1:35:53.447 --> 1:35:55.249
Are you going
after her?

1:35:56.650 --> 1:35:59.053
-Uh, she'll be fine.
-No, she won't.

1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:01.422
Go fix this.

1:36:03.324 --> 1:36:06.727
I puts
this whole thing together,

1:36:06.794 --> 1:36:09.330
and now everybody seem to know
better than me.

1:36:21.342 --> 1:36:22.676
Richard,

1:36:22.777 --> 1:36:25.112
do you think
you did this by yourself?

1:36:25.179 --> 1:36:27.681
From the first day we met.

1:36:27.782 --> 1:36:30.017
Remember that?
Out on that bus stop?

1:36:31.652 --> 1:36:34.655
You didn't even tell me
your real name.

1:36:34.755 --> 1:36:38.092
'Cause you thought I was just
another dumb nigga.

1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:41.195
You just like them White boys.

1:36:41.295 --> 1:36:42.930
You never believed
in none of this.

1:36:42.997 --> 1:36:44.832
When did I not believe?

1:36:44.932 --> 1:36:47.368
I want you to tell me,
when did I not believe?

1:36:47.468 --> 1:36:49.503
You not the only dreamer
in this family.

1:36:49.603 --> 1:36:51.172
Wouldn't be no dream
if it wasn't for me.

1:36:51.272 --> 1:36:54.275
I carried them
inside me and on my back.

1:36:54.341 --> 1:36:56.210
And I carried you, too.

1:36:56.310 --> 1:37:00.815
Working two shifts so I could
put food on your table.

1:37:00.881 --> 1:37:04.218
That open stance,
you got that from me.

1:37:04.318 --> 1:37:07.121
Oh, you did that? Oh, okay.

1:37:07.188 --> 1:37:10.558
And I fixed Serena's serve
because you messed that up.

1:37:10.658 --> 1:37:11.959
You did what?

1:37:12.026 --> 1:37:13.828
Yes, I fixed that toss
because you messed it up.

1:37:13.894 --> 1:37:15.529
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm here. I've been here

1:37:15.629 --> 1:37:18.132
dreaming and believing
just like you.

1:37:18.199 --> 1:37:20.167
-Mm-hmm.
-You just don't wanna see me.

1:37:21.702 --> 1:37:25.239
So, uh, what you want?

1:37:25.339 --> 1:37:27.741
What you want?
You want a thank you?

1:37:29.176 --> 1:37:30.978
That's all right, Richard.
That's all right.

1:37:31.045 --> 1:37:32.379
I don't need your thank you.

1:37:32.479 --> 1:37:33.747
Unlike you,

1:37:33.848 --> 1:37:36.417
I don't need the world
to tell me I'm great.

1:37:41.922 --> 1:37:43.424
See how you do?

1:37:43.524 --> 1:37:45.492
-You see what you just did?
-Come on.

1:37:45.559 --> 1:37:47.361
How you walk away
when something's not finished.

1:37:47.428 --> 1:37:49.263
-Did you just see that?
-Come on. Come on.

1:37:49.363 --> 1:37:50.865
You see that?
That's what you do...

1:37:50.931 --> 1:37:52.499
That's what you do with...
with all your businesses.

1:37:52.566 --> 1:37:55.236
Remember the cement
company business...

1:37:55.336 --> 1:37:56.403
Mm-hmm.

1:37:56.503 --> 1:37:58.239
...the cleaning company
business.

1:37:58.339 --> 1:38:00.207
All your other kids.

1:38:01.375 --> 1:38:03.244
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:38:03.344 --> 1:38:04.411
You sound like
you got something

1:38:04.511 --> 1:38:06.380
you need
to get off your chest.

1:38:06.447 --> 1:38:08.449
Don't let God stop you.
Say what you need to say.

1:38:08.549 --> 1:38:10.184
Oh, I said it.

1:38:10.251 --> 1:38:13.687
Your son showing up
in that red Nissan truck,

1:38:13.754 --> 1:38:15.022
knocking on my door,

1:38:15.089 --> 1:38:16.590
and all you had to say was,

1:38:16.690 --> 1:38:20.060
"Oh, look, it's my son.
He found me."

1:38:20.127 --> 1:38:22.963
And then all your other kids
showing up after that.

1:38:23.063 --> 1:38:24.298
Okay.

1:38:24.398 --> 1:38:26.800
See, another woman
would have left.

1:38:26.901 --> 1:38:29.370
But I stay
because I don't quit. You...

1:38:29.436 --> 1:38:31.805
You're the one who leaves.

1:38:31.906 --> 1:38:33.807
Well, go ahead, then.
Go ahead. Don't...

1:38:33.908 --> 1:38:36.143
I will stay right here
until the job is done.

1:38:36.243 --> 1:38:37.778
Don't stay here
doing me no favors.

1:38:37.878 --> 1:38:40.147
Richard, you think I'm staying
here because of you?

1:38:40.247 --> 1:38:41.982
I stay here
because of my girls.

1:38:42.082 --> 1:38:43.651
I stay here because I answer

1:38:43.751 --> 1:38:45.719
to something higher
than Richard Williams.

1:38:45.786 --> 1:38:46.954
And you better be glad

1:38:47.054 --> 1:38:49.757
because if I was
staying here for you,

1:38:49.823 --> 1:38:52.893
I would have been gone
a long time ago.

1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:54.895
-Look at this house.
-I'm looking.

1:38:54.962 --> 1:38:56.130
Look where you live.

1:38:56.230 --> 1:38:57.598
I'm looking.
I'm looking. I'm looking.

1:38:57.665 --> 1:38:58.599
Where would you live
if it wasn't for me?

1:38:58.666 --> 1:39:00.167
Where would you be?

1:39:00.267 --> 1:39:02.970
Stuck in some apartment
with three kids and no daddy.

1:39:03.070 --> 1:39:05.306
That's where you would be.

1:39:05.406 --> 1:39:08.976
Listen to you. That's your ego
and your bragging.

1:39:10.277 --> 1:39:11.912
You just scared.

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:14.782
You just scared.

1:39:15.616 --> 1:39:18.018
Scared you will fail.

1:39:18.118 --> 1:39:22.089
Scared that the world
will look at you and see

1:39:22.156 --> 1:39:26.694
another dumb nigga.

1:39:26.794 --> 1:39:31.432
And you know what?
You think they might be right.

1:39:34.702 --> 1:39:36.270
I have never,

1:39:37.471 --> 1:39:39.974
never thought that about you.

1:39:50.784 --> 1:39:52.786
You've done your job.

1:39:52.853 --> 1:39:55.889
And whether you wanna see it
or not, I've done mine.

1:39:55.990 --> 1:40:00.627
But this is Venus's life.
You gotta let her decide.

1:40:00.694 --> 1:40:02.863
Because if you don't
trust her to do that,

1:40:02.963 --> 1:40:05.232
she's gonna be
the one leaving you.

1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:21.575
So you wanna play?

1:41:23.110 --> 1:41:26.146
I don't know
why you won't let me.

1:41:26.246 --> 1:41:28.382
Unless you think
I'm not ready.

1:41:46.900 --> 1:41:50.471
When I was a little boy,
I grew up in Shreveport.

1:41:52.072 --> 1:41:54.108
One day, my father
took me to town.

1:41:54.174 --> 1:41:57.311
He give me this money to pay
this White man for something.

1:41:58.112 --> 1:41:59.746
Back in them days,

1:41:59.813 --> 1:42:03.450
Black folks weren't allowed
to touch White peoples.

1:42:03.517 --> 1:42:05.953
So I went to give
the man this money,

1:42:06.019 --> 1:42:08.355
and I accidently touched
his hand.

1:42:09.456 --> 1:42:11.592
And he start beating on me.

1:42:13.127 --> 1:42:14.828
He knocked me down,
his friends come over,

1:42:14.928 --> 1:42:19.099
they all start stomping on me
and beating on me.

1:42:19.166 --> 1:42:22.002
And I look up and I see
my father in the crowd,

1:42:23.170 --> 1:42:24.872
and he took off running.

1:42:26.974 --> 1:42:29.810
Left me there with these
grown men beating on me.

1:42:32.346 --> 1:42:34.848
Now, I haven't been
no great daddy...

1:42:36.517 --> 1:42:40.187
but I've never done nothing
but try to protect you.

1:42:43.390 --> 1:42:46.994
This next step
you about to take,

1:42:49.029 --> 1:42:51.665
it would...
It would be hard for anybody.

1:42:53.133 --> 1:42:54.968
But for you,

1:42:55.035 --> 1:42:56.870
you not gonna
just be representing you,

1:42:56.970 --> 1:42:58.238
you gonna be representing

1:42:58.338 --> 1:43:02.342
every little Black girl
on Earth.

1:43:04.344 --> 1:43:08.916
And you gonna be the one
gotta through that gate.

1:43:09.016 --> 1:43:12.252
And I just never
wanted you to look up...

1:43:14.521 --> 1:43:17.057
and see your daddy
running away.

1:43:22.062 --> 1:43:23.230
Daddy, you always said

1:43:23.330 --> 1:43:25.699
I'd be number one
in the world, right?

1:43:27.768 --> 1:43:30.537
Let's go out there
and show all of those people

1:43:30.604 --> 1:43:33.173
that I can handle
what's coming.

1:43:34.741 --> 1:43:37.411
And I'm not gonna
let you down.

1:43:38.579 --> 1:43:40.514
How could you, Junior?

1:43:44.718 --> 1:43:45.786
Come here.

1:43:59.900 --> 1:44:01.702
Welcome
to Oakland, California,

1:44:01.768 --> 1:44:03.303
for the Bank
of the West Classic

1:44:03.403 --> 1:44:05.472
where tomorrow, World No. 1

1:44:05.572 --> 1:44:07.608
and reigning
U.S. Open champion,

1:44:07.708 --> 1:44:09.643
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario,

1:44:09.743 --> 1:44:12.112
will face a tough draw
of challengers,

1:44:12.212 --> 1:44:16.116
all hoping to take home
the $400,000 purse.

1:44:16.216 --> 1:44:19.119
Among them,
14-year-old Venus Williams,

1:44:19.219 --> 1:44:22.656
who takes the court in her
first-ever professional match.

1:44:22.756 --> 1:44:25.058
In fact,
it will be the first match

1:44:25.125 --> 1:44:27.227
Williams has played
at any level

1:44:27.294 --> 1:44:29.062
in more than three years,

1:44:29.129 --> 1:44:31.398
since her father made
the controversial decision

1:44:31.465 --> 1:44:34.268
to pull her out of
Junior tournament tennis,

1:44:34.334 --> 1:44:38.238
which is the normal conduit
to tennis superstardom.

1:44:38.305 --> 1:44:41.675
Many questions remain about
how this talented youngster

1:44:41.775 --> 1:44:43.777
will now fare
under the pressure

1:44:43.844 --> 1:44:46.179
and spotlight
of the professional tour

1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:51.351
against veteran players after
so long away from competition.

1:44:51.451 --> 1:44:53.487
A worry even
her outspoken father...

1:44:53.587 --> 1:44:56.023
-There you go.
-...cannot hide.

1:44:56.123 --> 1:45:00.093
We been working for this day
for nine long, hard years.

1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:01.428
Uh, you be saying,

1:45:01.495 --> 1:45:03.196
"We gonna get there,
we gonna get there."

1:45:03.297 --> 1:45:07.934
And, uh, finally you get there
like today and you find out,

1:45:08.001 --> 1:45:09.369
"Wow.

1:45:09.469 --> 1:45:11.371
"We don't belongs here.

1:45:11.471 --> 1:45:13.373
We belong someplace else.

1:45:13.473 --> 1:45:15.809
We belong
back in the ghetto."

1:45:15.876 --> 1:45:20.981
A genius? A huckster?
Tomorrow, we will finally see.

1:45:21.048 --> 1:45:22.683
Is his dream only hype

1:45:22.783 --> 1:45:24.851
or is his daughter, in fact,

1:45:24.951 --> 1:45:28.021
what the tennis world
has been waiting for?

1:45:29.956 --> 1:45:31.224
You did it, Richard.

1:45:31.325 --> 1:45:33.126
Last year, there was
24 media credentials

1:45:33.193 --> 1:45:34.494
for this tournament.

1:45:34.561 --> 1:45:37.064
-This year, you got 200, so...
-

1:45:37.164 --> 1:45:38.732
-You know what? That's him.
-Okay. That's him.

1:45:38.832 --> 1:45:40.400
-We should get Venus, right?
- Okay. I got...

1:45:40.500 --> 1:45:42.369
Guys, it's go time.
Look alive.

1:45:42.469 --> 1:45:44.004
Come on. The man is here.
The man is here.

1:45:44.071 --> 1:45:45.839
The Nike man here.
Y'all, close that. Close that.

1:45:45.906 --> 1:45:48.208
This is it. This is it.
You guys are gonna go there.

1:45:48.308 --> 1:45:49.976
-Yep. Go get in your position.
- Okay. You ready?

1:45:50.043 --> 1:45:51.211
Get in your positions.

1:45:51.311 --> 1:45:52.746
Okay. You ready?
-

1:45:52.846 --> 1:45:54.147
Hey, Patrick, how you doing?

1:45:54.214 --> 1:45:55.582
Very well.
Good to see you, Rick.

1:45:55.682 --> 1:45:57.084
How's Terri
and the kids? They good?

1:45:57.184 --> 1:45:58.552
-They're good, thank you.
-Yeah? That little Billy

1:45:58.652 --> 1:46:00.087
-still playing baseball?
- That's right.

1:46:00.187 --> 1:46:01.521
-Yeah, he's swingin' away.
- I like that.

1:46:01.588 --> 1:46:02.589
Hello.
- Richard Williams.

1:46:02.689 --> 1:46:03.924
-Welcome.
-Hi. Patrick.

1:46:04.024 --> 1:46:05.325
-Nice to meet you.
- This is Oracene.

1:46:05.392 --> 1:46:06.660
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-That's my wife,

1:46:06.727 --> 1:46:08.261
-that's Brandy.
-Nice to meet you.

1:46:08.362 --> 1:46:09.763
-You know who that is.
-Honor to meet you. Honored.

1:46:09.863 --> 1:46:11.264
That's who you brought
that briefcase for.

1:46:11.365 --> 1:46:12.366
- That's right. Yeah.

1:46:13.500 --> 1:46:14.868
Well, you had a long trip...

1:46:14.935 --> 1:46:16.403
Mm-hmm.
-...and a big day tomorrow,

1:46:16.503 --> 1:46:17.771
so I am not gonna take up
too much of your time.

1:46:17.871 --> 1:46:19.005
Mm-hmm.

1:46:19.072 --> 1:46:21.274
Now, I hope it is clear

1:46:21.375 --> 1:46:23.677
how highly
we regard your daughter.

1:46:23.744 --> 1:46:26.880
We'd like to take her
off the table right now.

1:46:26.947 --> 1:46:29.783
-That is $3 million.
-Whoo.

1:46:29.883 --> 1:46:32.285
Signature shoe.
Signature line.

1:46:32.386 --> 1:46:34.621
We wanna build our women's
brand around Venus.

1:46:34.721 --> 1:46:37.457
Make her a marquee player.
How's that sound?

1:46:37.557 --> 1:46:39.393
Well, I think, uh...

1:46:41.061 --> 1:46:42.462
Well, actually,

1:46:43.563 --> 1:46:44.898
you need to be pitching her.

1:46:47.868 --> 1:46:50.070
Well, Venus,
what do you think?

1:46:50.137 --> 1:46:52.406
I mean,
that is a generous deal.

1:46:52.472 --> 1:46:53.874
It's a million more
than Capriati got

1:46:53.940 --> 1:46:56.209
-before she went pro.
- It's great.

1:46:56.276 --> 1:46:58.578
Plus, a real commitment
to invest

1:46:58.645 --> 1:47:00.213
in the charity
and outreach programs

1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:02.783
-you and your family support.
- That's great.

1:47:02.883 --> 1:47:05.552
We think you're gonna have
a tremendous career

1:47:05.619 --> 1:47:09.256
and we wanna help you
build it, starting today.

1:47:18.565 --> 1:47:20.634
Uh...
-

1:47:20.734 --> 1:47:22.736
-It's, uh...
-Yeah.

1:47:25.572 --> 1:47:27.507
-Um...
-

1:47:30.510 --> 1:47:33.346
Yeah, maybe...
Maybe just have a minute.

1:47:33.447 --> 1:47:34.648
You know,
just let the family...

1:47:34.748 --> 1:47:36.082
-Absolutely.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:47:36.149 --> 1:47:37.818
-No problem, just for...
-Of course, of course.

1:47:37.918 --> 1:47:39.986
But, uh, just to be clear,
this deal is for tonight only.

1:47:40.086 --> 1:47:41.788
It's off the table
as soon as you step

1:47:41.855 --> 1:47:44.191
on that court tomorrow, okay?
Take your time. Talk about it.

1:47:44.291 --> 1:47:45.425
Patrick,
listen, thank you.

1:47:45.492 --> 1:47:46.760
Yeah, we'll just
take a second.

1:47:46.827 --> 1:47:48.495
There is a heck
of a seafood buffet.

1:47:48.595 --> 1:47:49.863
Okay.

1:47:49.963 --> 1:47:51.198
Now, it's
on the mezzanine level, right?

1:47:51.298 --> 1:47:52.466
You don't wanna hit
one or two.

1:47:52.532 --> 1:47:54.201
A lot of people
get that wrong.

1:47:54.301 --> 1:47:55.502
Just fix your face
till the man get out the door.

1:47:55.602 --> 1:47:56.803
What does he mean by that?

1:47:56.870 --> 1:47:58.138
Let the man
get out the door first.

1:47:59.606 --> 1:48:01.041
No, I wanna know
what he means though.

1:48:01.141 --> 1:48:02.209
We gonna talk about it
when the man leaves.

1:48:02.309 --> 1:48:03.376
Just let him get out the door.

1:48:03.477 --> 1:48:04.945
What is going on?

1:48:05.011 --> 1:48:07.113
I... What did he mean by,

1:48:07.180 --> 1:48:08.949
it's one night only?
Tonight only?

1:48:09.015 --> 1:48:10.283
Don't you
worry about that.

1:48:10.350 --> 1:48:12.052
-Don't worry.
-But I wanna understand.

1:48:12.152 --> 1:48:13.553
He's just trying to scare us.
He's just trying to scare us.

1:48:13.653 --> 1:48:14.721
That's right.
He's trying to scare us,

1:48:14.821 --> 1:48:15.989
and guess what? I'm scared.

1:48:16.056 --> 1:48:18.391
I'm freaking terrified.

1:48:18.492 --> 1:48:21.895
Guys, what...
What is going on?

1:48:21.995 --> 1:48:25.465
$3 million.
What's the problem here?

1:48:25.532 --> 1:48:27.300
Rick, look...
-Let me see.

1:48:27.367 --> 1:48:29.236
They haven't even seen
the girl play yet.

1:48:29.336 --> 1:48:32.138
Yeah, no, that...
I mean, that's the point.

1:48:32.205 --> 1:48:35.141
They don't have to.
Richard, you did it.

1:48:35.208 --> 1:48:36.810
Hey, you did it, Richard.

1:48:36.877 --> 1:48:38.078
Look, I thought you were nuts.

1:48:38.178 --> 1:48:39.746
All the talking
and the interviews

1:48:39.846 --> 1:48:41.014
and the nonsense.

1:48:41.081 --> 1:48:43.250
But look, you were right,
she's a star.

1:48:43.350 --> 1:48:44.518
Look at what it...

1:48:44.584 --> 1:48:45.819
We won, this is it.

1:48:45.886 --> 1:48:48.488
Why is everybody so glum?
Please, guys.

1:48:48.555 --> 1:48:50.557
Oracene, please,
can you help me out here?

1:48:50.657 --> 1:48:52.692
You need
to be talking to Venus.

1:48:54.394 --> 1:48:56.496
V, what's going on?

1:48:58.565 --> 1:48:59.666
I just wanna show them

1:48:59.733 --> 1:49:01.334
-what I can do.
- Okay.

1:49:01.401 --> 1:49:03.436
I understand
it's a good offer but...

1:49:03.537 --> 1:49:04.538
This is
not a good offer.

1:49:04.604 --> 1:49:06.606
This is an unbelievable offer.

1:49:06.706 --> 1:49:09.276
Guys, this is money
that changes your lives.

1:49:09.376 --> 1:49:12.112
That changes your
family's lives. What do we...

1:49:12.212 --> 1:49:13.280
Rick,

1:49:13.380 --> 1:49:14.781
you asking this girl

1:49:14.881 --> 1:49:16.116
to take all the hard work
she done did for the last...

1:49:16.216 --> 1:49:17.450
Richard, stop it. Stop it.

1:49:17.551 --> 1:49:19.119
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1:49:19.219 --> 1:49:21.354
All the hard work she done did
for the last 10 years

1:49:21.421 --> 1:49:23.623
and accept the first offer
that come through the door.

1:49:23.723 --> 1:49:25.125
You know
that's not right, Rick.

1:49:25.225 --> 1:49:26.393
Richard,
the draw's not even out yet.

1:49:26.459 --> 1:49:28.094
-Rick.
- We don't know...

1:49:28.194 --> 1:49:30.764
The girl is asking
for a opportunity to compete.

1:49:30.864 --> 1:49:32.566
We don't even know
who she's playing.

1:49:32.632 --> 1:49:35.068
She don't care
nothing about that.

1:49:35.135 --> 1:49:38.705
Venus Williams,
do you care who you play?

1:49:38.772 --> 1:49:39.906
No, Daddy.

1:49:39.973 --> 1:49:41.575
Venus Williams,
are you gonna beat

1:49:41.641 --> 1:49:43.076
whoever on the other side
of that net?

1:49:43.143 --> 1:49:44.811
Yes, Daddy.

1:49:44.911 --> 1:49:47.948
Venus Williams,
do you wanna take this deal?

1:49:52.619 --> 1:49:53.787
No.

1:49:53.887 --> 1:49:55.388
Well, there it is.

1:49:55.455 --> 1:49:57.290
We're not taking the deal.
Let's go get something to eat.

1:49:58.925 --> 1:50:00.994
-Rick, you hungry?
-No.

1:50:01.094 --> 1:50:02.596
Come on,
everybody, let's go.

1:50:02.662 --> 1:50:04.164
-It's a...

1:50:04.264 --> 1:50:05.665
Come on, Rick,
you got to pay for this food.

1:50:05.765 --> 1:50:07.233
Hey, y'all.
-

1:50:07.300 --> 1:50:08.935
-Hey, everybody.
- Tunde!

1:50:09.002 --> 1:50:10.337
- There you go.

1:50:10.437 --> 1:50:11.905
-Look at that. Look at that.
-Hey. Whoa.

1:50:14.574 --> 1:50:16.176
Hi! How are you?
- Yeah.

1:50:16.276 --> 1:50:18.411
Mister Rick is paying for us
to go to the seafood buffet.

1:50:18.478 --> 1:50:20.814
Ooh.
- Yeah. Yes, come on.

1:50:20.914 --> 1:50:22.415
Hi.
-

1:50:22.482 --> 1:50:24.284
You knew about this?

1:50:29.255 --> 1:50:31.358
Yes.
- Yeah! Come on!

1:50:31.458 --> 1:50:32.659
Game, Stafford.

1:50:32.759 --> 1:50:34.861
Stafford leads
two games to love.

1:50:39.699 --> 1:50:40.867
Fault.

1:50:48.208 --> 1:50:49.209
Fault.

1:50:49.309 --> 1:50:50.443
Love-15.

1:50:52.712 --> 1:50:54.547
Come on, V.

1:50:54.648 --> 1:50:55.849
Fault.

1:51:01.321 --> 1:51:03.390
-

1:51:13.867 --> 1:51:16.169
-  Love-30.

1:51:20.740 --> 1:51:21.875
Fight back now.

1:51:25.078 --> 1:51:26.579
Come on, Junior.

1:51:31.151 --> 1:51:32.719
Love-40.

1:51:45.432 --> 1:51:46.700
Oh!
-

1:51:46.766 --> 1:51:48.034
Game, Stafford.

1:51:48.101 --> 1:51:50.070
Stafford leads
three games to love.

1:51:52.405 --> 1:51:53.606
She's looking
a little tight out there.

1:51:53.707 --> 1:51:55.175
But she's gonna loosen up.

1:51:55.241 --> 1:51:56.710
It's gonna be good. I'm gonna
check out another match.

1:51:56.776 --> 1:51:58.511
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1:52:04.250 --> 1:52:05.552
30-40.
- All right.

1:52:05.618 --> 1:52:06.686
That's all right.

1:52:17.564 --> 1:52:18.798
Game, Stafford.

1:52:18.898 --> 1:52:20.300
Stafford leads
four games to love.

1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:23.303
Hey, let it go now.
Next game. Let that go.

1:53:07.947 --> 1:53:09.115
Yeah!
-  Love-15.

1:53:09.182 --> 1:53:10.650
Attagirl, V.

1:53:14.921 --> 1:53:16.022
There you go.

1:53:19.092 --> 1:53:22.095
That's a great ball!
That's a great ball!

1:53:24.998 --> 1:53:26.199
Game, Williams.

1:53:26.299 --> 1:53:28.434
Stafford leads
four games to two.

1:53:31.805 --> 1:53:33.306
-Let's go!
-  Game, Williams.

1:53:33.373 --> 1:53:35.475
-There it is. There you go.
-Four games all.

1:53:58.631 --> 1:54:00.066
You were great
tonight, Venus.

1:54:00.166 --> 1:54:02.235
Were you surprised
how you handled your nerves?

1:54:02.335 --> 1:54:04.904
I was somewhat surprised
but somewhat not surprised.

1:54:05.004 --> 1:54:06.906
I guess since I haven't played
a tournament in a while,

1:54:07.006 --> 1:54:08.975
I was surprised that I wasn't
nervous or jumpy.

1:54:09.042 --> 1:54:10.810
Tomorrow, you play
the top seed, Vicario.

1:54:10.877 --> 1:54:14.047
She's number one in the world,
a three-time Grand Slam champ.

1:54:14.147 --> 1:54:15.915
How do you think
you'll hold up?

1:54:17.350 --> 1:54:19.586
I think I have the game
to beat anyone.

1:54:19.686 --> 1:54:21.020
I just have to play it.

1:54:21.087 --> 1:54:22.488
-Also, I was wondering...
-That's enough though.

1:54:22.555 --> 1:54:23.690
Real good questions.

1:54:23.756 --> 1:54:25.825
-Let's go! Huh?
-

1:54:25.892 --> 1:54:28.428
What did you do out there?
I... I couldn't believe it.

1:54:28.528 --> 1:54:30.029
-It's like...
-Okay, Rick, I gotta go.

1:54:30.096 --> 1:54:32.098
It's like she's a...
a hired assassin.

1:54:32.198 --> 1:54:34.734
I mean,
it's, like, unbelievable.

1:54:34.834 --> 1:54:36.669
Richard,
I talked to Dougherty.

1:54:36.736 --> 1:54:38.037
He's upping the offer.

1:54:38.104 --> 1:54:39.439
$4 million, Richard.

1:54:39.539 --> 1:54:42.242
$4 million.
We did it. We did it, Richard.

1:54:42.342 --> 1:54:43.710
I think we just gonna
keep our chips

1:54:43.776 --> 1:54:44.777
on the table though, Rick.

1:54:44.878 --> 1:54:46.045
Wait, wait. Hey, Richard, no.

1:54:46.112 --> 1:54:47.513
She's playing Vicario.

1:54:47.580 --> 1:54:49.015
She's the best player
on the planet, Richard.

1:54:49.082 --> 1:54:50.116
She's the best player
in the whole wide world.

1:54:50.216 --> 1:54:51.718
She... She can't beat her.

1:54:51.784 --> 1:54:53.453
But what if she do?

1:54:53.553 --> 1:54:54.954
Richard,
it doesn't work like that.

1:54:55.054 --> 1:54:57.757
Oh, hey, Bud. Bud.
Good to see you.

1:54:57.857 --> 1:54:59.425
Still got
them pretty pants on.

1:54:59.525 --> 1:55:01.094
You missed out on this money
though. I tried to tell ya.

1:55:01.194 --> 1:55:02.929
-You know him?

1:55:03.029 --> 1:55:05.298
Rick, if she beats Vicario,

1:55:05.398 --> 1:55:08.101
a 14-year-old
who's never played a match,

1:55:08.201 --> 1:55:12.038
walks off the street and beats
the best player on the planet,

1:55:12.105 --> 1:55:13.539
forget Ali-Frazier,

1:55:13.606 --> 1:55:16.576
it'll be the greatest upset
in the history of sports!

1:55:39.432 --> 1:55:40.733
-Oh.
-

1:55:43.937 --> 1:55:46.306
-

1:55:52.245 --> 1:55:54.414
Meek, come on.

1:56:08.962 --> 1:56:11.931
I know you love Venus,

1:56:11.998 --> 1:56:14.867
and all this is exciting,

1:56:14.968 --> 1:56:17.370
but it's a little hard
for you, too, huh?

1:56:20.974 --> 1:56:22.675
Can I tell you a secret?

1:56:24.444 --> 1:56:28.014
Your sister is gonna be
number one in the whole world,

1:56:28.114 --> 1:56:29.882
no doubt about it.

1:56:29.983 --> 1:56:31.217
I know that.

1:56:32.118 --> 1:56:34.053
But you,

1:56:34.153 --> 1:56:36.689
you gonna be
the best there ever was.

1:56:38.057 --> 1:56:42.295
You gonna be
the greatest of all time.

1:56:42.362 --> 1:56:45.798
You know how I know?
'Cause I planned for it.

1:56:47.367 --> 1:56:50.737
I knew you was having
a hard time in Venus's shadow,

1:56:50.837 --> 1:56:53.139
but I kept you there
'cause I knew you was rough.

1:56:53.206 --> 1:56:56.242
I knew you was tough,
I knew you was a fighter.

1:56:57.877 --> 1:57:00.713
That's why I did
this whole thing like this.

1:57:04.851 --> 1:57:06.519
Go on, take that in.

1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:09.389
You're up next.

1:57:19.198 --> 1:57:22.068
Come on now. Move your feets.

1:57:22.168 --> 1:57:24.370
One, two, three, four, five.

1:57:24.437 --> 1:57:26.005
One, two, three, four, five.

1:57:26.072 --> 1:57:28.608
One, two, three, four, five.

1:57:28.708 --> 1:57:30.543
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

1:57:30.610 --> 1:57:32.445
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

1:57:32.545 --> 1:57:33.946
Now, whatever
happens tonight...

1:57:34.047 --> 1:57:35.848
Close, close.
- Next time, 10.

1:57:35.915 --> 1:57:38.384
...I want you guys to remember

1:57:38.451 --> 1:57:41.421
that you come
from a rich history of people.

1:57:42.121 --> 1:57:43.256
Right?

1:57:43.356 --> 1:57:45.792
Like Sojourner Truth.

1:57:45.892 --> 1:57:47.860
-Remember her?
- Yes.

1:57:47.927 --> 1:57:50.296
What did she say
at Seneca Falls?

1:57:50.396 --> 1:57:52.598
What she say? What she say?

1:57:52.698 --> 1:57:54.700
"Ain't I a woman?"
-That's right, that's right.

1:57:54.767 --> 1:57:55.968
And what does
that mean to you?

1:57:56.069 --> 1:57:57.904
-What does that mean to you?
-Um...

1:57:57.970 --> 1:58:00.706
That she's strong
and that she can do anything.

1:58:00.773 --> 1:58:01.974
Exactly.

1:58:02.075 --> 1:58:04.911
That she was
a young Black woman,

1:58:04.977 --> 1:58:06.746
just like you guys,

1:58:06.813 --> 1:58:09.115
and that she deserves
to be seen,

1:58:09.215 --> 1:58:12.485
and that she deserves
to be heard.

1:58:12.585 --> 1:58:15.154
So, tonight, I want you
to remember who you are,

1:58:15.254 --> 1:58:17.990
remember where you came from.

1:58:18.091 --> 1:58:20.393
Stand tall
and be proud in that.

1:58:21.928 --> 1:58:23.129
All right?

1:58:24.931 --> 1:58:27.600
Yeah.
You gonna look beautiful.

1:58:30.069 --> 1:58:31.971
You are beautiful, Venus.

1:58:36.676 --> 1:58:39.445
-You too, Serena.
-

1:58:42.348 --> 1:58:43.950
Hello, everybody,

1:58:44.016 --> 1:58:45.518

who makes
her center court debut here

1:59:00.032 --> 1:59:02.468
before a sold-out crowd
tonight.

1:59:07.974 --> 1:59:09.208
Waiting for my daughter
to come out.

1:59:09.308 --> 1:59:10.643
She playing the next match.

1:59:40.840 --> 1:59:42.575
-Love you, Junior.
-Love you, too, Daddy.

1:59:42.675 --> 1:59:44.343
Welcome, ladies
and gentlemen, to the Bank

1:59:44.410 --> 1:59:45.912

1:59:46.012 --> 1:59:47.680

...for tonight's
second-round match.

1:59:49.415 --> 1:59:51.751
Making her center court
debut here tonight,

1:59:51.851 --> 1:59:54.587
and just her second
professional match,

1:59:54.687 --> 1:59:57.089
please give a warm
Bay Area welcome

1:59:57.190 --> 2:00:01.894

2:00:01.994 --> 2:00:05.164
Venus Williams!

2:00:17.777 --> 2:00:21.681
Now, please join me
in welcoming to the court,

2:00:21.747 --> 2:00:23.282
hailing from Spain,

2:00:23.382 --> 2:00:26.118
a three-time
Grand Slam champion,

2:00:26.219 --> 2:00:28.287
and the number-one seed,

2:00:28.387 --> 2:00:32.258
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario!

2:01:06.726 --> 2:01:08.494
15-love.

2:01:17.737 --> 2:01:19.772
Venus!

2:01:19.839 --> 2:01:22.008
30-love.
-There you go.

2:01:23.109 --> 2:01:24.810
Y'all gonna miss it.

2:01:44.030 --> 2:01:45.097
40-love.

2:01:57.710 --> 2:01:59.345
Game, Williams.

2:01:59.445 --> 2:02:01.647
Williams leads one-love.

2:02:04.817 --> 2:02:06.519
That's how she do that.

2:02:06.619 --> 2:02:08.554
Impressive.
- Yep. Yep.

2:02:16.829 --> 2:02:18.364
15-40.

2:02:30.409 --> 2:02:31.877
Game, Williams.

2:02:31.977 --> 2:02:34.480
Williams leads two-love.

2:02:38.050 --> 2:02:39.251
Game, Williams.

2:02:39.352 --> 2:02:40.686
Williams leads
three games to love.

2:02:40.753 --> 2:02:42.021
Ooh!
-  First set.

2:02:42.088 --> 2:02:44.390
See that?
Flames come off that ball.

2:02:48.828 --> 2:02:50.363
40-15.
-That's it. That's it.

2:02:50.429 --> 2:02:51.764
You like that?

2:02:51.864 --> 2:02:54.600
My wife taught her that.

2:02:54.700 --> 2:02:57.870
That's Venus Williams.
Remember that name.

2:03:01.741 --> 2:03:04.343
Okay, that's a can of corn.
That's a can of corn!

2:03:06.612 --> 2:03:07.913
Game, Williams.

2:03:08.013 --> 2:03:10.416
Williams leads
five games to two.

2:03:10.516 --> 2:03:11.550
First set.

2:03:11.617 --> 2:03:13.619
See how she do
that open stance?

2:03:13.719 --> 2:03:15.755
-That's what we worked on.
-Yeah.

2:03:19.525 --> 2:03:21.026
That's right.

2:03:21.093 --> 2:03:23.062
Looking good, Venus Williams.

2:03:27.366 --> 2:03:28.634
-Whoa.
-There you go.

2:03:28.734 --> 2:03:30.703
Game. First set.
Venus Williams.

2:03:30.770 --> 2:03:33.139
-Come on, Venus!
-That's it, kid! That's it!

2:03:37.777 --> 2:03:38.978
There you go.

2:03:39.078 --> 2:03:41.113
That's all that hard work,
right there.

2:04:00.433 --> 2:04:01.801
Game, Williams.

2:04:01.901 --> 2:04:03.569
-She leads the set 3-1.

2:04:03.636 --> 2:04:06.972
She's scared of you.
She's scared of you, Venus.

2:04:17.116 --> 2:04:19.018
¡Esto es una locura!

2:04:52.117 --> 2:04:53.786
Just stay loose, Junior.

2:05:07.867 --> 2:05:09.368
She's gone to the toilet.

2:05:10.803 --> 2:05:11.871
Okay.

2:05:32.157 --> 2:05:34.193
We're right here
with you, Venus.

2:05:37.162 --> 2:05:38.697
-Stay in your game.
- Let it go.

2:05:38.764 --> 2:05:40.099
Stay in your game.
-You stay right there.

2:05:40.199 --> 2:05:41.100
-Stay in your game.
-You got it, V.

2:05:41.200 --> 2:05:42.434
We love you.

2:05:50.342 --> 2:05:52.545
Don't let it
get in your head, Junior.

2:06:01.754 --> 2:06:02.755
Oh, come on.

2:06:02.855 --> 2:06:04.423
What's... What's happening?

2:06:05.791 --> 2:06:07.259
She's icing her.

2:06:07.359 --> 2:06:09.528
-They don't have a rule...
-There's nothing we can do.

2:06:09.595 --> 2:06:10.796
...for how long
you can stay in the...

2:06:10.896 --> 2:06:12.264
They can't... There's...

2:06:12.364 --> 2:06:14.633
She can just say she's
in there using the toilet.

2:06:14.733 --> 2:06:16.201
It's a dirty, old trick.

2:06:19.104 --> 2:06:21.140
That's eight minutes already.

2:06:22.274 --> 2:06:24.109
That's eight minutes.

2:06:26.745 --> 2:06:28.447
That's nine minutes.

2:06:34.954 --> 2:06:36.956
You got her
on the ropes!

2:06:39.592 --> 2:06:40.559
Let's go!

2:06:40.626 --> 2:06:42.561
This is ridiculous!

2:06:56.842 --> 2:06:58.477
Why won't she stand up?

2:06:59.445 --> 2:07:00.813
Stand up, Junior.

2:07:25.537 --> 2:07:27.706
That's all right,
just stay in it, V.

2:07:27.806 --> 2:07:29.842
Let's go, Venus.
- Hey, V, your game.

2:07:29.942 --> 2:07:32.378
Your game, Venus. Let's go.

2:07:32.478 --> 2:07:34.613
Time.
- That's right. Let's go.

2:07:37.483 --> 2:07:39.852
Yeah! Feel your game!

2:08:01.340 --> 2:08:05.144
Out.
-  Love-15.

2:08:05.210 --> 2:08:07.579
-You got the next one, Venus.
-Hey, fight it.

2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:09.581
You got the next one, Venus.

2:08:15.854 --> 2:08:18.057
-Let!
-  Fault.

2:08:19.425 --> 2:08:21.193
Let it go. Let's go.
Next one.

2:08:34.540 --> 2:08:35.574
Yes!

2:08:39.044 --> 2:08:40.579
Come on, Venus Williams.

2:08:55.894 --> 2:08:57.529
¡Esta si!

2:08:57.596 --> 2:09:00.466
Game, Vicario.
Three games all.

2:09:06.605 --> 2:09:07.906
15-40.

2:09:14.046 --> 2:09:15.581
Okay, Junior.

2:09:21.320 --> 2:09:23.055
Game, Vicario.

2:09:26.425 --> 2:09:28.594
-Game, Vicario.

2:09:32.965 --> 2:09:35.234
-Game. Second set,

2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:38.170
Vicario, six-three.
One set all.

2:09:46.078 --> 2:09:48.147
-

2:09:49.748 --> 2:09:51.183
Oh, my God.

2:10:43.902 --> 2:10:46.471
Five-love. Final set.

2:10:59.151 --> 2:11:00.919
-

2:11:01.019 --> 2:11:02.421
Love-40.

2:11:06.225 --> 2:11:07.993
It's all right, Venus.

2:11:26.678 --> 2:11:28.380
-

2:11:28.447 --> 2:11:31.283
Game, set, and match.
Vicario, two sets to one.

2:11:31.383 --> 2:11:34.386
Two-six, six-three, six-love.

2:11:45.063 --> 2:11:46.465
Good job, Venus.

2:11:49.401 --> 2:11:53.572
She did good out there.
She did great. She did great.

2:12:03.248 --> 2:12:05.817
-

2:12:15.427 --> 2:12:17.129
Hey, V.

2:12:19.631 --> 2:12:20.732
Okay.

2:12:32.444 --> 2:12:34.446
I should have won tonight.

2:12:38.450 --> 2:12:41.186
Now all our deals,
no respects...

2:12:41.286 --> 2:12:43.322
Uh-uh. No. No, no, no.

2:12:43.422 --> 2:12:44.656
-Don't do that.
- Mm-mm.

2:12:44.756 --> 2:12:46.291
You were counting on me.

2:12:46.358 --> 2:12:48.760
Okay, okay,
you listen to me.

2:12:49.661 --> 2:12:50.796
Look here.

2:12:52.130 --> 2:12:54.333
You just went toe-to-toe

2:12:54.433 --> 2:12:56.301
for two hours

2:12:56.368 --> 2:12:59.471
with the number-one player
in the whole world.

2:12:59.538 --> 2:13:00.939
Had her shook.

2:13:01.006 --> 2:13:03.008
-Had her knees shaking.
-Yes.

2:13:03.809 --> 2:13:04.977
Yes.

2:13:05.043 --> 2:13:06.979
And you did it with grace.

2:13:08.847 --> 2:13:11.883
If you don't have no respect
for yourself right now,

2:13:11.984 --> 2:13:13.986
you will never have none.

2:13:14.653 --> 2:13:15.954
At all.

2:13:17.289 --> 2:13:20.826
You are a champion,
Venus Williams.

2:13:20.892 --> 2:13:22.961
And the whole world know it.

2:13:24.396 --> 2:13:27.232
You gonna walk out there
with your head up.

2:13:28.834 --> 2:13:32.204
I have never been more proud
of a person

2:13:32.304 --> 2:13:33.972
in my whole life.

2:13:39.711 --> 2:13:42.147
Come on, your sisters outside
waiting for you. It's cold.

2:13:53.191 --> 2:13:54.926
Daddy, I'll take my bag.

2:13:55.027 --> 2:13:57.329
-No, I'll carry it, Junior.
-I got it.

2:14:09.941 --> 2:14:11.943
Hey, champion.

2:14:12.044 --> 2:14:13.412
There she go.

2:14:21.586 --> 2:14:23.255
We're proud of you.

2:14:23.355 --> 2:14:25.524
- You did it, V.

2:14:50.315 --> 2:14:53.218
We're proud of you.
You did good.

2:14:53.285 --> 2:14:56.988
You're the second of
all the players in the world.

2:14:57.089 --> 2:14:58.790
This is the exit.
I can let you all out here.

2:14:58.890 --> 2:15:00.826
Thank you, sir.
Y'all go ahead.

2:15:11.837 --> 2:15:13.004
Richard.

2:15:13.105 --> 2:15:15.073
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:15:15.140 --> 2:15:17.976
-Venus! Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:15:18.076 --> 2:15:21.613
Venus! Venus! Venus!
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:15:21.680 --> 2:15:25.183
Venus! Venus!
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:15:25.283 --> 2:15:27.419
They look like they know.

2:15:27.486 --> 2:15:30.322
Go on. Don't keep 'em waiting.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

2:15:30.422 --> 2:15:32.124
That's your fans. Go ahead.

2:15:33.291 --> 2:15:35.026
-Come on, Serena, come.
-Okay!

2:15:35.127 --> 2:15:36.094
You next!

2:15:36.161 --> 2:15:38.096
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:15:38.163 --> 2:15:39.831
Richard. Richard.

2:15:40.632 --> 2:15:41.766
How about that, huh?

2:15:41.833 --> 2:15:43.635
Hey, Nike's back on the line.

2:15:43.702 --> 2:15:45.971
I mean, they're... They're
coming out of the woodwork.

2:15:46.037 --> 2:15:47.439
Puma. Fila. Reebok.

2:15:47.506 --> 2:15:49.508
They all wanna meet.
They all wanna meet first.

2:15:49.608 --> 2:15:51.309
I'mma tell 'em
they can kiss my backside.

2:15:51.376 --> 2:15:53.378
No, I think
we'll talk to the peoples.

2:15:53.478 --> 2:15:55.113
I think we gonna talk to them.

2:15:55.180 --> 2:15:57.516
Hey, Richard, she did it.

2:15:57.616 --> 2:15:59.217
Oh, yeah, she did it.

2:16:02.454 --> 2:16:04.623
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:16:04.689 --> 2:16:09.728
Venus! Venus! Venus! Venus!
Venus! Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:16:11.796 --> 2:16:17.402
Venus! Venus! Venus!
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:16:17.502 --> 2:16:21.506
Venus! Venus!
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2:16:53.171 --> 2:16:57.576
To be alive

2:16:57.676 --> 2:17:03.615
By my side

2:17:03.715 --> 2:17:09.621
If I tried

2:17:09.721 --> 2:17:15.393
With pride

2:17:21.733 --> 2:17:25.537
How far I'll go

2:17:27.939 --> 2:17:31.309
Paved with gold

2:17:31.409 --> 2:17:34.112
We had the kids' future
planned before they were born,

2:17:34.212 --> 2:17:36.781
and the first day that I took
Venus and Serena

2:17:36.881 --> 2:17:39.751
to the tennis court,
I knew I had champions.

2:17:39.818 --> 2:17:41.720
Sometimes I feel like
it was just...

2:17:41.786 --> 2:17:43.822
destiny, for the both of 'em.

2:17:43.922 --> 2:17:45.323
If you were a tennis player,

2:17:45.423 --> 2:17:46.725
who would you want to be like?

2:17:46.791 --> 2:17:49.995
I'd like other people
to be like me.

2:17:50.095 --> 2:17:52.497
If she plays the way
that she's capable of,

2:17:52.597 --> 2:17:53.665
this kid's gonna be great.

2:17:55.767 --> 2:17:57.335
Venus and Serena Williams

2:17:57.435 --> 2:17:59.104
have made tennis history.

2:18:04.976 --> 2:18:06.344
They're the first sisters

2:18:06.444 --> 2:18:08.179
and the first
African Americans

2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:13.318
ever to claim the top two
spots in the world rankings.

2:18:13.418 --> 2:18:16.955
By my side

2:18:17.022 --> 2:18:20.358
If I tried...

2:18:20.458 --> 2:18:22.093
People are so captivated

2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:26.431
by the story of sisters
having to play each other.

2:18:26.498 --> 2:18:28.600
This is how we've always
dreamed it would be.

2:18:35.440 --> 2:18:36.975
Young African-American kids,

2:18:37.042 --> 2:18:39.444
they're seeing a reflection
of themselves.

2:18:39.511 --> 2:18:41.446
No matter which one win,
we still win.

2:18:41.513 --> 2:18:43.882
Raise your hand,
Serena. Venus.

2:18:46.885 --> 2:18:51.222
On our own...

2:18:51.323 --> 2:18:52.857
My dad,
he always thought

2:18:52.957 --> 2:18:54.526
it was important for me
to give back to the community.

2:18:57.729 --> 2:19:00.065
Being number one
is great, but fighting for

2:19:00.165 --> 2:19:02.167
the generation to come
is even better.

2:19:02.233 --> 2:19:05.570
To stay alive...

2:19:12.911 --> 2:19:14.579
I'll never forget
my dad said,

2:19:14.679 --> 2:19:16.915
"This is the moment we've been
working for all our lives.

2:19:17.015 --> 2:19:19.217
"Stay focused
and don't be afraid."

2:19:21.720 --> 2:19:24.155
Open the stance.
That's... There you go.

2:19:28.526 --> 2:19:30.161
They will remember
Venus and Serena.

2:19:30.228 --> 2:19:32.497
They will say, "Boy,
they did it. I can do it."

2:19:37.369 --> 2:19:38.937
We'll win,
and we'll share our victory

2:19:39.037 --> 2:19:41.239
with every person
in the world.
