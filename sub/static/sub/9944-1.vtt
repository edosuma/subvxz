WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:05.572
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:15.660 --> 01:16.854
You know it makes sense.

01:16.940 --> 01:20.137
You might be beyond the help of
beauty sleep, Frank, but I'm not.

01:20.220 --> 01:21.175
Hey,

01:21.260 --> 01:24.889
inner beauty
is the measure of the man.

01:24.980 --> 01:26.493
I earned this face.

01:32.940 --> 01:33.895
Oooh, eggy-peggy.

01:41.780 --> 01:47.138
'Oh, what a rogue
and peasant slave am I!

01:47.220 --> 01:50.690
'Is it not monstrous that this
player here, but in fiction,

01:50.780 --> 01:55.774
'in a dream of passion, could force
his soul so to his own conceit?

01:55.860 --> 02:00.331
'He would drown the stage with tears
and cleave the general ear

02:00.420 --> 02:02.411
'with horrid speech.'

02:02.500 --> 02:04.092
< Go on, fuck off.

02:04.180 --> 02:08.219
Oh, what fucking price beauty.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.255
< Fuck off, Frank.

02:09.340 --> 02:12.776
'Make mad the guilty
and appal the free.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.418
'Confound the ignorant,

02:14.500 --> 02:19.620
'and amaze indeed the very faculties
of eyes and ears.

02:19.700 --> 02:24.933
'Yet, am I, Vernon Francis Gallagher,
a rogue and peasant slave?

02:25.020 --> 02:28.615
'Did I say nothing for my cause?

02:28.700 --> 02:31.453
'What was my cause?

02:31.540 --> 02:34.338
'What nature of man have I been? '

02:37.060 --> 02:40.655
GRUNTS, CAR ALARM BLARES

02:40.740 --> 02:43.937
'Fucking Shakespeare.

02:44.020 --> 02:45.658
'What a cunt.'

02:49.660 --> 02:51.298
(Debbie) Come on, read it!

02:51.380 --> 02:53.416
In the government of which country

02:53.500 --> 02:59.336
did Canaan Banana
serve in the 1970's and 80's?

02:59.420 --> 03:02.810
Banana?
That's not a real name - false.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.458
It's not a true or false question.

03:04.540 --> 03:07.054
- All right, true, then.
- You need to name the country.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.210
I'm not bothered, Debbie.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.494
(Both) lan!

03:10.580 --> 03:11.695
I'm gonna turn it down.

03:11.780 --> 03:14.089
We're playing a game!
What's the answer, Liam?

03:14.180 --> 03:16.330
Zim... Zim...

03:16.420 --> 03:19.059
Zimbabwe. Your turn, Carl.

03:20.660 --> 03:25.529
Five. One, two, three, four, five.
I'm in the centre!

03:25.620 --> 03:26.735
Can I read it?

03:26.820 --> 03:28.856
(Both) No!

03:29.220 --> 03:32.576
After which Italian explorer
is the USA named?

03:32.660 --> 03:35.128
It's Amerigo Vespucci.

03:35.220 --> 03:36.335
Shut up!

03:36.420 --> 03:38.650
They teach you that at uni?

03:38.740 --> 03:41.300
Yeah, how you doing?

03:41.380 --> 03:42.415
Amerigo Vespucci.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.855
Hello, mate. High five.

03:44.940 --> 03:45.975
Amerigo Vespucci.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.778
He told you, game abandoned.

03:47.860 --> 03:52.650
- How did you get here?
- Hitched. Took me fucking eight hours.

03:52.740 --> 03:55.891
Do you want a cuppa,
Prodigal Son or something stronger?

03:55.980 --> 03:57.618
- I'd love one.
- Spots have cleared up.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.170
Oh, thanks, Mum! Hello, baby.

04:01.260 --> 04:02.375
It's not fair.

04:02.460 --> 04:03.779
(Lip) I've missed you too.

04:03.860 --> 04:06.374
I've never won before.

04:06.460 --> 04:07.893
Shut up.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.209
(Lip) <i>Twinkle, twinkle...</i>

04:15.300 --> 04:17.052
Wave. Wave to Mummy.

04:17.140 --> 04:18.892
Clever girl!

04:18.980 --> 04:20.538
When did she learn that?

04:20.620 --> 04:21.894
A few weeks ago.

04:21.980 --> 04:25.017
Feel like I'm missing
out on everything.

04:25.100 --> 04:28.615
Don't be daft. Can't be two places
at once, can you?

04:28.700 --> 04:32.739
Besides, she's a total Daddy's girl.

04:32.820 --> 04:33.889
KNOCKING

04:34.340 --> 04:35.295
What?

04:35.380 --> 04:38.053
You're not at uni now,
you lazy student ligger.

04:38.140 --> 04:39.289
It's hardly a lie-in, is it?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.336
- I thought you wanted to pick up a shift.
- I do.

04:41.420 --> 04:42.853
- Ten minutes.
- Nice one.

04:44.460 --> 04:47.099
This is brilliant.
How much'd it cost in the shops?

04:47.180 --> 04:48.852
A lot more than what I paid for it.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.416
If you're gonna have a wank,
at least lock the door.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.455
I weren't wanking.

04:54.540 --> 04:55.609
You're sick.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.497
I'm not. Debs, wait.

04:57.580 --> 05:00.048
Out the way.

05:00.140 --> 05:03.018
- I weren't wanking, I were...
- What?

05:03.100 --> 05:05.853
I... I were praying.

05:07.020 --> 05:09.739
- At least make it believable.
- I was!

05:09.820 --> 05:11.731
I haven't had my end away
since Meena.

05:11.820 --> 05:14.334
I've got bollocks like footballs.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.775
You think Jesus
is gonna help you get some girl

05:16.860 --> 05:18.816
on her back, thinking of England?

05:18.900 --> 05:20.049
I don't want her to think of England.

05:20.140 --> 05:21.732
I know what you want

05:21.820 --> 05:24.175
and praying isn't going to get it yer.

05:25.180 --> 05:26.533
How not?

05:32.260 --> 05:34.728
- See you for lunch.
- Come on, we'll be late.

05:35.860 --> 05:39.694
Quite the little Anthea Turner
these days, aren't you?

05:39.780 --> 05:44.456
We're not letting Granny get
under our skin today, are we, Katie?

05:44.540 --> 05:47.179
You tell her, not today, Granny.

05:47.260 --> 05:50.297
I'm too young to be called Granny.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.258
Say "Monica". Monica.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.375
< Monica.

05:55.460 --> 05:57.576
Why won't God help me?

05:57.660 --> 06:00.220
Mainly cos he doesn't exist.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.939
No blaspheming in front
of the children, Debbie.

06:03.020 --> 06:04.373
I'm an atheist.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.020
(Carl) People have miracles.
Saw it on a documentary.

06:07.100 --> 06:11.651
A bloke were crippled, got dipped in
a Grotty, then he could walk again.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.219
In a "Grotty"?

06:13.300 --> 06:14.779
Maybe an agnostic. Haven't decided yet.

06:14.860 --> 06:18.330
Religion's just superstition, left
over from when we lived in caves.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.729
I mean, we didn't know how
the sun rises in the morning,

06:20.820 --> 06:23.015
and the crops grow in the summer.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.297
It's just a way of explaining
things that we don't comprehend.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.776
That has been blocked for two months.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.293
Four times you've done that.

06:34.380 --> 06:37.577
It's early. I forgot!
And there's no fucking milk!

06:39.340 --> 06:42.138
Cleverer people than you
believe in God, Debbie.

06:43.260 --> 06:45.216
- Where did you read that? Heat or OK?
- Come on.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.815
It's not my fault we live in
a celebrity-obsessed culture.

06:50.420 --> 06:52.456
COUGHS

06:53.900 --> 06:55.618
COUGHS

06:56.940 --> 06:58.817
Get off! Aaaarrghhh!

06:58.900 --> 07:04.850
- Is everything all right?
- No, everything is not all right.

07:04.940 --> 07:08.853
I just woke up with this sheet
on me head, and I know for a fact

07:08.940 --> 07:10.976
I did not join
the fucking Ku Klux Klan.

07:11.060 --> 07:13.176
Your breath was causing
other patients to feel nauseous.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.649
Oh, distracting them
from the MRSA, was it?

07:15.740 --> 07:18.538
Keep your voice down, please.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.656
What, waking the dead, are we?

07:20.740 --> 07:22.970
COUGHS

07:23.060 --> 07:25.051
Hello, anybody home?

07:25.140 --> 07:29.577
Hey, if you see a bright light,
walk towards it.

07:29.660 --> 07:30.854
More than I can do.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.540
Jesus wept.

07:36.220 --> 07:37.175
Oh, my...!

07:38.540 --> 07:40.212
It looks like a black pudding.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.097
Hey, I don't think so,
Harold fuckin' Shipman.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.011
What's all...

07:47.100 --> 07:49.898
What's this... What does NFA mean?

07:49.980 --> 07:53.097
Notify Family Afterwards.

07:53.180 --> 07:54.169
After what?

07:54.260 --> 07:56.649
We did some tests
when you were under.

07:56.740 --> 07:58.014
Right.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.489
You're suffering
from aortic stenosis.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.571
When it's at home, love.

08:02.660 --> 08:05.458
There's an obstruction
to your aortic valve.

08:05.540 --> 08:08.259
Not enough blood
getting to your heart.

08:08.340 --> 08:10.410
So, what, it's like
a pill or something?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.456
No pill, Mr, er...

08:12.540 --> 08:14.770
Gallagher. Frank Gallagher.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.452
No operation.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.929
This is a terminal diagnosis.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.013
Truth is, if you make it to the weekend,
it'll be a minor miracle.

08:25.460 --> 08:26.415
The weekend?

08:28.180 --> 08:31.217
Fucking hell, you're having a...
Come on, it's gotta be...

08:36.299 --> 08:37.892
Don't you dare die.

08:37.980 --> 08:39.379
I'm alive!

08:41.380 --> 08:42.335
Pathetic!

08:42.419 --> 08:44.729
- Dad!
- He's just pissed.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.936
He's not breathing.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.013
I'm dying.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.813
Pack it in. I can't concentrate.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.492
I'm nearly finished. I'm just...

09:03.580 --> 09:04.774
It's not you, it's him.

09:07.340 --> 09:10.218
Hey, relax. I was just
fixing a pipe, when I, er...

09:10.300 --> 09:11.574
saw an opening.

09:11.660 --> 09:12.934
This is a place of work.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.578
(Jamie) We're just trying
to keep our record up.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.775
What record?

09:15.860 --> 09:18.977
They've had a shag at least once
every day since they've been married.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.971
It's like a chain letter.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.539
You break the sequence
and you're jinxed.

09:22.620 --> 09:23.575
Nice one.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.128
All right, Dad.

09:26.220 --> 09:27.448
A pint and four Es.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.337
Not open for another ten minutes.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.969
Oh, not today, oh, Lord! Not today!

09:33.060 --> 09:38.657
Do not abuse the minuscule authority
you possess. Not today.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.173
OK, keep your hair on.

09:42.260 --> 09:43.659
Oh!

09:45.780 --> 09:46.895
Thank you.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.211
What's wrong with you, Dad?

10:00.500 --> 10:03.219
My mortality
is weighing heavily, son...

10:05.100 --> 10:09.013
...like an albatross around me...

10:09.100 --> 10:10.294
legs.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.696
Don't give him any more Es.

10:28.220 --> 10:31.212
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.291
Third time you've
been late this week.

10:33.380 --> 10:35.496
It's me nieces,
they keep me up all hours.

10:35.580 --> 10:37.332
I don't give a shit
what your excuse is.

10:37.420 --> 10:38.853
I'm not paying for a cleaner
who's never here.

10:38.940 --> 10:41.659
You're not the fuckin' boss of me.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.617
I'm not hoovering it tomorrow.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.214
What d'you mean,
<i>you're</i> not paying for a cleaner?

10:47.300 --> 10:49.450
Who d'you think's running the gaff,

10:49.540 --> 10:51.895
since Carol fucked off
with two months' takings?

10:51.980 --> 10:54.448
So muggins here has been left
holding the shit-bucket.

10:54.540 --> 10:55.734
Sorry I asked.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.695
Now, where were we?

10:59.780 --> 11:01.896
Sorry. I've lost me erection.

11:01.980 --> 11:04.494
lan, hoover doesn't go here.

11:08.820 --> 11:11.778
GROANS AND GRUNTS

11:13.340 --> 11:16.173
Fucking hell! What do you
want, you creepy little twat?

11:17.260 --> 11:18.454
Who are you?

11:18.540 --> 11:19.939
I'm Frank Gallagher.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.170
Don't you recognise me?

11:23.300 --> 11:26.212
<i>Burn, baby, burn, disco inferno...</i>

11:27.300 --> 11:28.494
What?!

11:28.580 --> 11:31.811
All right, Frank.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.937
He can't see me.
Only you can, cos you're dying.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.136
You've got a guilty conscience.

11:37.220 --> 11:38.255
Can you see him?

11:38.340 --> 11:40.251
Who?

11:40.340 --> 11:44.538
Him. Fucking refugee
from the Partridge Family.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.578
You're a fucking walking advert
for abstinence, you are, Frank.

11:47.660 --> 11:48.854
Guilty conscience about what?

11:48.940 --> 11:49.895
You what?

11:49.980 --> 11:52.210
About wasting your life.

11:52.300 --> 11:55.019
You're pissing on your shoes.

11:55.100 --> 12:00.128
Oh, fuck,
I can't feel a fucking thing. Oh!

12:18.820 --> 12:20.538
Oh...

12:20.620 --> 12:22.178
I'm looking for Phil.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.215
Wrong house.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.609
Phil Gallagher?

12:42.580 --> 12:44.889
No. I am not interested.

12:44.980 --> 12:47.574
I've got enough on my mind
as it is without being stalked

12:47.660 --> 12:50.732
by the ghost
of Christmas fucking past.

12:50.820 --> 12:54.893
And what are you wearing?
Looks like a sofa cover.

12:56.780 --> 12:59.089
You're counting, aren't you?

12:59.180 --> 13:00.374
What?

13:00.460 --> 13:04.009
If you can make it to the end of the
week, you're counting how much beer

13:04.100 --> 13:07.456
and how many pills you can
get down your neck before you die.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.656
Well, what else am I supposed to do?

13:09.740 --> 13:12.095
I'm facing the fucking celestial
firing squad here.

13:12.180 --> 13:16.139
If you expect me to get on my knees.
"Excuse me, God, now I'm going

13:16.220 --> 13:22.375
"to pop my clogs, if you wouldn't mind
wiping the slate clean."

13:22.460 --> 13:25.213
I've got some dignity, you know.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.656
Life's a precious gift.

13:30.740 --> 13:33.129
Most people
try and do something with it.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.778
What have you done?

13:34.860 --> 13:36.612
Hey, I have done...

13:38.060 --> 13:39.812
...plenty.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.209
I could've done things,
been someone.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.256
Instead of which, I became you.

13:44.340 --> 13:47.537
What's the point of you?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.649
What are you doing here?

14:08.740 --> 14:11.300
You told me you were an orphan.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.132
Who's this?

14:14.740 --> 14:19.450
This is Alex, Phil's girlfriend

14:19.540 --> 14:21.132
from uni.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.932
Who's Phil?

14:31.100 --> 14:32.533
Fuck!

14:34.980 --> 14:36.538
Shit!

14:37.940 --> 14:39.737
Fuck.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.369
Are you with him?

14:46.380 --> 14:47.972
I've got a right to the truth...

14:48.060 --> 14:50.210
I've come here
all the way from Brighton.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.892
Was he expecting you?

14:51.980 --> 14:55.973
Well, no.
I've got a domestic situation,

14:56.060 --> 14:58.449
and I needed some support
from my boyfriend.

15:04.740 --> 15:06.173
Upstairs.

15:16.860 --> 15:19.579
She's a nutter.
I saw her once, twice at most...

15:19.660 --> 15:23.448
Three months, she says, since
the fourth day of Freshers' Week.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.178
- What?
- Think she stood silent

15:25.260 --> 15:26.773
while you ran off
to find your backbone?!

15:26.860 --> 15:29.420
What other lies have you told?

15:29.500 --> 15:32.253
Did you use condoms?

15:32.340 --> 15:36.618
Yeah... She's not pregnant, is she?
She told me she were on the pill.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.931
If she is up the duff,
she hasn't mentioned it.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.932
My concern is more diseases,
since you shagged me last night,

15:43.020 --> 15:45.409
and you've been riding
bareback with her.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.853
Jesus Christ, Lip,
it's not rocket science.

15:46.940 --> 15:48.168
I know. I'm sorry.

15:48.260 --> 15:49.978
Four simple rules.

15:50.060 --> 15:54.099
Always use condoms, never get involved,
neither of us finds out who

15:54.180 --> 15:57.217
the other one's shagging,
and it never impacts on our home.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.133
It were your idea.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.335
I need to talk to Phil.

16:01.420 --> 16:04.218
You'll get your turn. Fuck off!

16:05.380 --> 16:08.850
The whole point
of an open relationship

16:08.940 --> 16:10.419
is to protect what we've got.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.979
Not completely forget about it.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.528
I know, I made a mistake.

16:14.620 --> 16:17.214
Fucking right, you did.
And you're going to sort it.

16:21.460 --> 16:23.451
Last thing...

16:23.540 --> 16:27.328
I want it noted that you've
never found out about mine.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.212
Lillian?

16:45.300 --> 16:46.779
Lillian?

16:46.860 --> 16:48.054
Hello, love.

16:50.020 --> 16:52.250
I thought I'd pop round.
Look, I'm sorry

16:52.340 --> 16:54.137
I flew off the handle a bit earlier.

16:54.220 --> 16:57.849
If anyone's apologising, it's me.
Don't get me sleep, I'm like a bear

16:57.940 --> 16:59.976
with a sore arse.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.972
- What are you doing?
- Catching up on some domestics.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.130
It's like a Chinese laundry
in here with the girls.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.815
Thanks, Victor, love.
See you next week, all right.

17:08.900 --> 17:13.451
These girls aren't really
your nieces, are they, Lillian?

17:13.540 --> 17:16.259
Not by blood, but
they like to call me "Auntie".

17:17.339 --> 17:21.094
They've had their problems,
bless 'em, living on the street as such,

17:21.180 --> 17:25.332
D-R-U-G-S.
But I'm looking after them now.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.772
Ta-ra, Mike!

17:31.380 --> 17:32.733
Right.

17:35.860 --> 17:38.055
This can't be right,
it's Lillian's house.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.018
We've got a nosy neighbour
keeping a log, taking photos,

17:41.100 --> 17:42.453
17 men in 24 hours.

17:42.540 --> 17:44.132
Who'd have thought it?
Madam Sin.

17:44.220 --> 17:46.495
It's a competitive market these days,

17:46.580 --> 17:49.458
with the Eastern European girls
offering more for less.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.417
(Carrie) We'll have to raid her.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.378
- No!
- We've got no choice.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.898
Don't see how we have to shift,
it's our house.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.652
(Debbie) Cos they need privacy to talk.

18:00.740 --> 18:04.130
The bedroom probably isn't the most
appropriate venue, considering.

18:04.220 --> 18:07.212
You an' all, Monica.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.450
I thought you might need
a mature head.

18:09.540 --> 18:12.293
If you know any,
be sure and let us know.

18:12.380 --> 18:15.099
Frank, I think you should hear this.

18:15.180 --> 18:19.856
No, no, no! It's all just
tomorrow's chip paper.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.658
I'd better go and see
what's bothering your dad.

18:23.420 --> 18:25.695
I thought your dad died in Bosnia.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.331
Oh... >

18:35.420 --> 18:37.615
Frank?
What are you looking for?

18:37.700 --> 18:40.009
Wedding photograph.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.534
There. There, see, wedding day.

18:42.620 --> 18:45.657
I was there, I made an impact
on that day, didn't I?

18:45.740 --> 18:49.335
Mmm, but you were unconscious
in that one so we had to prop you up.

18:52.180 --> 18:56.253
Fiona, birth of my first-born,
that has to count, ain't it?

18:56.340 --> 18:58.979
Mmm, except you're not in that one,

18:59.060 --> 19:03.212
cos you disappeared
to wet the baby's head... for four days.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.733
Oh, fucking hell. >

19:06.580 --> 19:10.937
Mon, Mon, I need you to tell me,
have I been a good man?

19:11.020 --> 19:12.851
You know, made a contribution?

19:12.940 --> 19:14.339
Of course you have, love.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.853
Well, how? Show me evidence.

19:17.820 --> 19:20.129
Look, what's brought all this on?

19:20.220 --> 19:21.778
I'm dying, Mon.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.299
I took a piss on a generator...

19:32.260 --> 19:36.219
...and me cock got burnt,
and I went to hospital, and...

19:36.300 --> 19:38.211
and... and...
SOBS

19:38.300 --> 19:39.779
...and they said I've got...

19:41.580 --> 19:43.889
...stenography of the heart.

19:43.980 --> 19:47.939
All right, all right.
Come on, calm down.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.931
Calm down!

19:50.020 --> 19:52.375
SOBS QUIETLY

19:53.500 --> 19:55.411
Tell me all about it.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.810
We have an open relationship,

19:58.900 --> 20:02.779
he can see other people,
and so can I.

20:02.860 --> 20:06.330
Cardinal rule is,
you don't get involved.

20:06.420 --> 20:09.378
So, I was just a fling, was I? >

20:09.460 --> 20:11.815
What happened to
going travelling together,

20:11.900 --> 20:14.209
and, "Do you believe in soul mates"?

20:14.300 --> 20:18.896
Is no-one in this fucking world
who they appear to be?!

20:18.980 --> 20:24.100
I was woken up at 5.30am,
by the police arresting my mum and dad,

20:24.180 --> 20:27.695
they've been running
a time-share scam in Turkey.

20:27.780 --> 20:31.455
Have you any idea what it's like
to have criminals for parents?

20:31.540 --> 20:34.850
I thought at least
you were there for me.

20:38.340 --> 20:42.936
She said... She said I'll be lucky
to make it beyond the weekend.

20:43.020 --> 20:47.377
Oh, don't be silly,
you're just confused.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.849
You had a lot to drink last night,
that's all...

20:49.940 --> 20:52.135
No! Mon, my head
has never been clearer.

20:54.140 --> 20:57.496
And I need to know,

20:57.580 --> 20:59.571
I mean, what is my legacy?

21:05.140 --> 21:06.937
Well...

21:09.780 --> 21:12.897
Well, I suppose you could say, um...

21:14.700 --> 21:16.850
Go on!

21:16.940 --> 21:19.454
Jesus, Frank, it's not easy.

21:19.540 --> 21:22.816
You're an alcoholic. You've never put
a penny in the family pot.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.289
You've as much chance of being
elected Prime Minister

21:25.380 --> 21:29.168
as naming any of your
eight children's birthdays.

21:30.780 --> 21:34.295
Well, thank you very fucking much
for your support!

21:34.380 --> 21:39.329
Oh, Frank, don't spit the dummy out,
nobody looks to you for achievements,

21:39.420 --> 21:43.095
you're not an achievement
kind of a bloke!

21:44.220 --> 21:46.609
So, who made heaven and earth, then?

21:46.700 --> 21:48.213
Well, for a start,
there is no heaven.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.131
The earth started with the Big Bang.

21:50.220 --> 21:54.816
So, what happens when you die,
smartarse?

21:54.900 --> 21:57.573
Nothing, you just die.

21:57.660 --> 22:03.337
Remember, Man, thou art dust,
and into dust thou shalt return.

22:03.420 --> 22:06.412
- Dad, tell her, sure there's a God.
- What?

22:06.500 --> 22:09.890
God. Does He, She or It exist?

22:09.980 --> 22:12.050
Carl wants to know
if divine intervention

22:12.140 --> 22:13.573
can help him get his end away.

22:16.980 --> 22:18.891
In the dark of night...

22:20.500 --> 22:23.253
...every atheist half-believes, Debs.

22:25.340 --> 22:28.491
So if I come back to haunt you,

22:28.580 --> 22:30.696
you'll know for sure.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.652
What kind of answer's that?

22:37.740 --> 22:40.174
I knew nothing about you,

22:40.260 --> 22:41.818
or the little girl.

22:43.540 --> 22:45.178
As far as I was aware,

22:45.260 --> 22:48.218
he was an orphan, who brought
himself up from the age of 14.

22:51.020 --> 22:53.614
(Lip) It was a white lie
that got out of hand,

22:53.700 --> 22:56.772
it wasn't meant to go this far.

22:56.860 --> 22:58.259
What wasn't? The lie, or our relationship?

22:58.340 --> 23:01.093
Both.

23:01.180 --> 23:05.696
I think you're stretching it a bit
to call it a relationship.

23:05.780 --> 23:09.534
No, no, no, no, no!

23:14.180 --> 23:16.136
Don't stop on my account.

23:19.780 --> 23:22.533
It's like being a prisoner
in your own home!

23:24.580 --> 23:27.378
SIGHS HEAVILY

23:29.580 --> 23:31.616
It seems you've got a choice to make.

23:37.620 --> 23:38.973
Oh, well, I'll help. >

23:39.060 --> 23:41.972
Cos I can't kick the dust of this
place off my shoes quick enough.

23:42.060 --> 23:43.493
I'm having a brew.

23:43.580 --> 23:44.979
I'm really sorry...

23:57.940 --> 24:00.659
What's your happiest memory of me?

24:00.740 --> 24:03.129
Bloody hell, Dad,
what you lurking for?

24:03.220 --> 24:06.576
Just tell me, daughter to father,
best birthday party?

24:06.660 --> 24:08.378
Favourite day out?

24:08.460 --> 24:12.089
I never had a birthday party, and
you were always wasted on days...

24:12.180 --> 24:13.818
Well, there was that time when...

24:13.900 --> 24:15.015
Yeah, go on.

24:15.100 --> 24:17.534
When we went to court
to see you being bound over.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.214
I wanted to be a lawyer
for ages after that.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.177
And that's it?

24:22.260 --> 24:25.935
Well... I could make something up,
if you want.

24:27.900 --> 24:28.935
Et tu, Debbie?

24:30.940 --> 24:32.373
Et tu?

24:37.420 --> 24:38.899
You ate two what?

24:46.580 --> 24:48.730
Dad?

24:57.380 --> 24:58.972
All right?

25:01.420 --> 25:03.012
Did I hurt you?

25:03.100 --> 25:05.091
No.

25:05.180 --> 25:07.057
Yeah. It stings like fuck.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.859
So does my wrist.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.134
What's your plan?

25:13.860 --> 25:15.816
Haven't got one.

25:15.900 --> 25:17.458
Look, I'm really sorry about...

25:17.540 --> 25:21.977
I don't care about the stupid lies
you've told about your family.

25:22.060 --> 25:24.210
I just need to know one thing.

25:25.300 --> 25:28.531
Stuff you said when it was
just you and me, the pillow talk.

25:28.620 --> 25:30.019
Did you mean it?

25:30.100 --> 25:32.011
Of course I did.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.295
Then I don't understand.

25:34.380 --> 25:36.098
Neither do I.

25:36.180 --> 25:38.091
I'll sort it out when I get
back to Nottingham, yeah?

25:38.180 --> 25:40.569
No, Phil, it's not good enough.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.133
I have to go to work.

25:43.220 --> 25:46.895
- What?
- I've got a shift at the pub.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.413
I can't just not go.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.531
I'll see you at uni.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.374
Nobody would give a good account of you.

26:00.460 --> 26:03.930
If anything,
you've had a negative impact.

26:04.020 --> 26:06.215
(Mocking) "If anything,
you've had a negative impact!"

26:06.300 --> 26:07.289
What you doing?

26:08.300 --> 26:09.369
What you doing?

26:09.460 --> 26:11.894
- Looking for evidence.
- Evidence of what?

26:11.980 --> 26:14.494
Of why you're here,
and why you're haunting me,

26:14.580 --> 26:18.289
like Casper the fucking
less than friendly previous self.

26:18.380 --> 26:19.495
You know why.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.730
No, I do not.

26:23.900 --> 26:27.609
All right, so I've contributed
slightly less than Einstein

26:27.700 --> 26:30.931
and slightly more than Fred West
to the human condition, so what?

26:31.020 --> 26:34.012
Who the fuck are you to criticise?

26:35.300 --> 26:36.938
Oh!

26:40.500 --> 26:44.971
See! Hey?
I was hardly a little angel, was I?

26:45.060 --> 26:48.655
Already well acquainted with Lady Palm
and her five fucking sisters.

26:48.740 --> 26:51.538
So what,
I never said I was an angel.

26:55.260 --> 26:57.933
Then what do you want?

26:58.020 --> 26:59.578
What else happened when you were 12?

26:59.660 --> 27:01.457
I don't know.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.255
Malcolm Allison
became City manager.

27:06.340 --> 27:08.456
Rodney Marsh shagged a model.

27:08.540 --> 27:13.091
- Closer to home.
- I don't know.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.213
Well, they cancelled my birthday
because...

27:27.380 --> 27:28.813
...Mum died.

27:30.420 --> 27:33.173
You promised you'd make her proud.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.578
How could I make her proud
with him as me old man?

27:45.660 --> 27:48.094
< You'll see her soon enough.

27:48.180 --> 27:51.092
< Tell her yourself
about the man you became.

27:51.180 --> 27:55.219
< That is, if you make it up there.

27:55.300 --> 27:58.212
What, heaven?

27:58.300 --> 28:02.054
< Confession's good for the soul,
especially if the Day of Judgement

28:02.140 --> 28:03.573
< is fast approaching.

28:05.340 --> 28:08.412
But... But I can't go to chapel.
I'm barred.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.013
< Who needs a priest?

28:10.100 --> 28:13.172
< With a soul as black as yours,
you'd better get started.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.215

28:19.740 --> 28:21.298
Hello, Dennis?

28:21.380 --> 28:23.336
Listen, remember that party,

28:23.420 --> 28:27.333
when somebody put the chip pan on
and the house burnt down?

28:27.420 --> 28:29.854
Right. Anyhow, it was me.

28:29.940 --> 28:32.693
Hello, is that Emma?
Hi, it's Frank Gallagher here.

28:32.780 --> 28:34.452
It was me. Remember that party...

28:34.540 --> 28:36.212
...when you shagged that builder,

28:36.300 --> 28:38.860
and your old fella cottoned on
and turfed you out?

28:38.940 --> 28:41.170
Rickets?
Hi, it's Frank Gallagher here.

28:41.260 --> 28:43.410
It was me. It was me. It was me.

28:43.500 --> 28:47.573
Yeah. Yes, I know I'm a cunt,
but I just thought you should know.

28:47.660 --> 28:50.458
Hello, Dennis? Frank again.
I forgot to say...

28:54.420 --> 28:58.698
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody, it was the wrong number.

28:58.780 --> 29:03.808
- Oh, look at you. You're all sweaty.
- No, I haven't got time for this, Mon.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.253
Isn't that Lip's?

29:05.340 --> 29:07.729
Yeah, well, he'll get
it back soon enough.

29:07.820 --> 29:09.253
Frank?

29:11.700 --> 29:14.168
I probably didn't tell you enough, Monica,

29:14.260 --> 29:16.376
but I love you.

29:24.940 --> 29:28.694
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:28.780 --> 29:31.852
So, where's this pub
your brother's working at?

29:32.820 --> 29:33.775
Just over there.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.896
So, are you gonna
buy me a drink then?

29:39.780 --> 29:42.135
I'll give you the money.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.417
Come on, Mrs Maguire.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.173
I am claiming my conjugal rights.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.091
I'm busy.

29:56.180 --> 29:59.331
Oh, come on, it doesn't have to be
a Doctor Zhivago or anything.

29:59.420 --> 30:00.409
A quickie'll do.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.650
Well, that's tempting.

30:03.740 --> 30:05.253
Meet you upstairs in five.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.779
You're having a fucking laugh!

30:21.020 --> 30:23.136
Karen?

30:23.220 --> 30:24.494
Can I have a word?

30:27.980 --> 30:30.540
Are you mental?

30:30.620 --> 30:32.975
Open relationships are never equal!

30:33.060 --> 30:34.379
What was the alternative?

30:34.460 --> 30:37.850
Him tripping over himself, trying
to remember which lie he's told?

30:37.940 --> 30:40.773
When he goes back to uni,
if it's not this one,

30:40.860 --> 30:43.055
it'll be somebody else.

30:43.140 --> 30:45.176
We're holding him back.

30:46.380 --> 30:49.577
I just hope you've been getting some
to even out the score.

30:52.860 --> 30:54.816
Fucking annoying thing is...

30:56.420 --> 30:59.253
...I love him, Karen.

30:59.340 --> 31:00.773
Hey!

31:17.140 --> 31:19.700
By the time you view this,

31:19.780 --> 31:21.372
I will be dead.

31:28.740 --> 31:30.651
I've led a full life -

31:30.740 --> 31:32.219
or perhaps a fool's life -

31:32.300 --> 31:33.813
I'll let history be the judge.

31:35.340 --> 31:38.889
But I leave you
the proud father of six...

31:38.980 --> 31:40.777
...the proud father of eight.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.455
So...

31:47.700 --> 31:50.612
Lip, you were a gobby little shite,

31:50.700 --> 31:52.736
always had too much
to say for yourself.

31:52.820 --> 31:56.335
So you should know that I've had
a lickle piss in every bottle of pop

31:56.420 --> 31:59.253
you've left in the fridge since 1997.

He's not here at the moment.

32:17.540 --> 32:19.929
Between the ages of three and four,

32:20.020 --> 32:23.057
I regularly gave Liam
a couple of downers,

32:23.140 --> 32:25.335
so he would shut the fuck up.

32:25.420 --> 32:27.729
I dropped Carl on his head
when he was a baby.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.698
...And then they fucking haul you in
for indecent exposure.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.010
I still don't see
what's indecent about it,

32:33.100 --> 32:35.375
cos if they all had Alzheimer's,
how would they know any different?

32:35.460 --> 32:38.770
If there's something wrong with him,
you better fucking tell...

32:38.860 --> 32:42.773
And finally, something
I've always guarded with my life.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.010
- Where you going?
- I need to find your dad.

32:47.380 --> 32:48.699
That's it.

32:50.980 --> 32:52.379
The end.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.650
How did I wind up here?

32:56.740 --> 32:59.493
You were always gonna wind up here.

32:59.580 --> 33:02.253
Christ! I've never been before.

33:02.340 --> 33:06.492

- I know.

33:06.580 --> 33:09.458
- Which one is it?
- You'll find it.

I should know. I've been there.

- Somebody paid you for sex?
- It's all about self-esteem.

41:09.740 --> 41:11.696
Who the fuck are you talking to?

41:13.900 --> 41:18.132
Oh, oh, fuck.

41:18.220 --> 41:20.256
Told yer. There is a God!

41:24.020 --> 41:25.453
Is that it?

41:28.980 --> 41:30.811
Don't be silly.

41:30.900 --> 41:34.051
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're exploiting women.

41:34.140 --> 41:37.018
They'd be on the streets otherwise.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.294
What's this?

41:38.380 --> 41:41.053
It's for running the cards through.
Yvonne sold it me wi' carbon,

41:41.140 --> 41:42.858
100 quid. I'm rubbish with cash.

41:42.940 --> 41:45.408
It's all Chip and PIN these days, Lillian.
Banks don't use this any more.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.616
So, you haven't made
one penny profit.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.897
- Which means she hasn't committed a crime.
- What?!

41:50.980 --> 41:52.971
What about the other evidence?

41:53.060 --> 41:54.732
What about the neighbours' photos,
the log?

41:54.820 --> 41:56.936
Without any proof to back it up,
it's just hearsay.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.130
GIRLS LAUGHING

42:01.580 --> 42:04.731
Result being, though,
you lot haven't made no money.

42:16.940 --> 42:18.214
How are you feeling?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.456
I don't know.

42:26.620 --> 42:28.178
Mandy, listen.

42:30.860 --> 42:33.579
I'm so sorry.

42:33.660 --> 42:35.218
I lost sight.

42:36.460 --> 42:39.179
Uni's full of kids wi' no worries,

42:39.260 --> 42:40.818
free to do whatever they want...

42:41.980 --> 42:45.131
...and I forgot what's important.

42:45.220 --> 42:47.575
You and Katie are what's important.

42:47.660 --> 42:51.130
We'll knock the open relationship
on the head.

42:51.220 --> 42:54.815
I'm gonna quit uni and get a job,
stay here.

42:54.900 --> 42:57.209
Will you fuck! You'll go back.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.973
I'm not having you use me
as an excuse for failing.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.855
You know I love you, don't you?

43:07.940 --> 43:09.134
Of course I do.

43:10.260 --> 43:12.012
Good.

43:13.380 --> 43:15.940
Cos that's why we're finished.

43:16.020 --> 43:19.217
No, Mandy,
I couldn't give a toss about Alex.

43:19.300 --> 43:20.938
I know, but that's not the point.

43:21.020 --> 43:23.056
If it's not her,
it'll be somebody else.

43:23.140 --> 43:24.539
No, it won't, I promise.

43:24.620 --> 43:27.817
It will, Lip. I know for a fact.

43:27.900 --> 43:31.097
You could have slept with 20 girls
over that three months,

43:31.180 --> 43:33.614
but you didn't, you stuck with one.

43:33.700 --> 43:37.329
- I was stupid.
- Just listen to me.

43:37.420 --> 43:41.413
It's not about jealousy or blame,

43:41.500 --> 43:45.015
it's about what you want.

43:45.100 --> 43:47.489
And in your fantasy...

43:49.300 --> 43:53.134
...there is no me, and there's no Katie.
- That's not true.

43:53.220 --> 43:56.337
How many people at uni know
you've got a daughter?

44:00.220 --> 44:03.018
Your life's out there now.

44:03.100 --> 44:05.694
Alex was right.

44:05.780 --> 44:07.816
You don't belong here any more.

44:14.820 --> 44:16.811
Go back to uni,

44:16.900 --> 44:18.970
till Easter.

44:20.620 --> 44:23.373
You can visit Katie then.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.257
She'll always be your daughter.

44:26.380 --> 44:27.574
You need to go.

44:27.660 --> 44:29.776
Mandy, please. Don't...

44:29.860 --> 44:33.853
Mandy, please. Mandy.

44:33.940 --> 44:35.259
Fuck's sake.

44:38.860 --> 44:40.737
Hiya, Mon.

44:40.820 --> 44:42.776
Have you any idea about the worry

44:42.860 --> 44:45.693
that you have put me through
these last 24 hours?

44:45.780 --> 44:48.772
- You're good to go.
- You? What about me?

44:48.860 --> 44:52.933
A death sentence, followed by
an unprovoked and savage assault.

44:53.020 --> 44:55.215
Well, I hope it's knocked
some sense into you.

44:57.460 --> 45:01.578
Wait... Just... No... The doctor...
The doctor said...

45:01.660 --> 45:04.299
There is nothing wrong
with your heart.

45:04.380 --> 45:06.894
They've been running
tests all morning.

45:08.740 --> 45:10.890
It's not... But they phoned you.

45:10.980 --> 45:14.097
My mistake. They weren't calling
about your dicky ticker.

45:14.180 --> 45:18.458
They were calling
about your dicky cock!

45:18.540 --> 45:22.453
Cooling cream, to stop your
little man from going all scabby.

45:27.540 --> 45:31.010
Hey, aortic fucking stenosis!

45:31.100 --> 45:34.172
My heart is stronger than Popeye
in a spinach factory.

45:34.260 --> 45:36.615
What medical school did you go to?

45:36.700 --> 45:40.375
You are going to have a malpractice suit
so far up your...

45:40.460 --> 45:42.815
I'm not a doctor. I never said I was.

45:42.900 --> 45:44.015
What?!

45:44.100 --> 45:47.490
I came to see if you were all right,
and you just assumed.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.696
Bollocks.

45:51.780 --> 45:55.739
What about Notify Family Afterwards?

45:55.820 --> 45:59.017
As far as I know,
NFA means No Fixed Abode.

45:59.100 --> 46:01.614
You were in such a state when
you came in, they could hardly

46:01.700 --> 46:05.329
get a name out of you,
let alone an address.

46:06.820 --> 46:08.014
Fuck!

46:08.100 --> 46:11.376
So, you know, what's your fucking game,
hanging about hospitals

46:11.460 --> 46:13.928
trying to scare the living shit out
of everybody?

46:14.020 --> 46:17.137
"Waking the dead. If you see
a bright light, walk towards it."

46:17.220 --> 46:18.573
That was my husband you were heckling.

46:18.660 --> 46:20.059
Why should I
have shown you any courtesy?

46:20.140 --> 46:21.653
Well, there's a difference

46:21.740 --> 46:24.379
between courtesy and telling a body
that they're gonna die.

46:24.460 --> 46:26.690
I was tending to my husband
when you woke up.

46:32.180 --> 46:33.613
So, what's wrong with him?

46:36.700 --> 46:40.579
He has aortic stenosis.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.458
So he's dying?

46:53.660 --> 46:55.173
All right, mate.

46:55.260 --> 47:00.414
Hey, I know exactly what
you're going through.

47:00.500 --> 47:03.936
I tell you there's
fuck all to worry about.

47:04.020 --> 47:06.534
Yeah?

47:06.620 --> 47:08.053
'So what if I never peaked?

47:08.140 --> 47:11.177
'I was here. I've lived.

47:13.100 --> 47:15.773
'Am I a rogue and peasant slave?

47:15.860 --> 47:18.579
'A muddy-mettled rascal?
Who gives a shit?

47:18.660 --> 47:20.855
'What did fucking Shakespeare know?

47:20.940 --> 47:23.249
'He never even wrote
most of them plays.

47:23.340 --> 47:26.855
'So what, if I'm not an astronaut,
or a Prime Minister,

47:26.940 --> 47:30.489
'or a football player?
I am Vernon Francis Gallagher.

47:30.580 --> 47:35.290
'I came, I saw,
I drank the fucking lot.'

48:18.420 --> 48:22.698
(Frank) And finally,
something I've always guarded with me life

48:22.780 --> 48:25.533
and, I hope, won't sully your memory of me.

48:27.660 --> 48:32.654
Monica, at your 21st birthday party,
when you were passed out on the coats,

48:32.740 --> 48:35.379
I shagged your mother, God rest her soul.

48:36.500 --> 48:39.412
I was wasted, but she wasn't - dirty cow.

48:39.500 --> 48:43.971
Anyhow, the upshot is,
you know that surprise late baby

48:44.060 --> 48:46.494
that your mam and dad never planned?

48:46.580 --> 48:49.333
Your little sister?

48:49.420 --> 48:54.733
Well, technically,
she's also your stepdaughter.

48:56.340 --> 48:57.659
The end.
