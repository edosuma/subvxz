[BO narrating]
Previously on Lost Girl:

00:08.176 --> 00:09.882
[BO] Kenzi?

00:10.094 --> 00:10.844
Bobo.

00:11.053 --> 00:11.633
You don't look dead.

00:11.846 --> 00:12.710
I don't feel dead.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.307
[DYSON] The wearer of
the shoes collects souls

00:15.516 --> 00:16.756
to build a dark army.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.432
An army to end all life.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.181
[TRICK] Souls are assigned
to different realms.

00:21.397 --> 00:22.762
[BO] Maybe this is Heaven.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.062
You belong to him.

00:24.275 --> 00:24.764
My father.

00:24.984 --> 00:27.270
[KENZI] No. No! No!

00:27.486 --> 00:28.987
[TRICK] Someone or
something wants her

00:29.197 --> 00:30.403
to bring Hell on Earth.

00:30.615 --> 00:31.695
[VALKYRIE VOICE] On blessed wings

00:31.908 --> 00:35.366
our allegiance carry
forth the human soul.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.703
[KENZI] Help!

00:38.915 --> 00:41.122
[knocking]
[KENZI] Help!

00:42.001 --> 00:44.242
Ah, what the fudge, man?

00:44.462 --> 00:45.952
[KENZI] I was a beautiful
bride enjoying unlimited

00:46.172 --> 00:49.756
waffle bar privileges and
now I'm stuck in my own grave.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.458
[knocking on casket]

00:52.678 --> 00:56.591
[KENZI breathing heavily]

00:56.807 --> 00:58.513
You can do this K Star.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.967
This is...

01:01.187 --> 01:03.269
This is cozy.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.805
No. No.

01:08.194 --> 01:13.063
[KENZI exhales heavily]

01:13.282 --> 01:16.740
It's okay. It's okay.
You love laying down.

01:16.953 --> 01:19.535
|t's--|t's a nap.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.113
A dirt nap, forever and ever.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.949
Oh for the love of help, help!

01:25.169 --> 01:27.455
[LAUREN and DYSON] Kenzi?

01:27.672 --> 01:28.957
[KENZI] Someone...

01:29.173 --> 01:30.754
[DYSON] Hold on!

01:32.927 --> 01:35.213
[KENZI] Push it real good...

01:35.429 --> 01:36.418
Kenzi.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.300
Just stay with us.

01:38.516 --> 01:39.801
[KENZI] I've never
been so happy to see

01:40.017 --> 01:42.508
your stuck-up
mug in all my life.

01:44.563 --> 01:47.350
[KENZI] Did you bother to get
a man mani like I taught you?

01:47.566 --> 01:50.729
Gah, just 'cause I died, do I
even want to look at your feet?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.105
It's good to have you back.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.436
[KENZIﬂghﬂ

01:53.656 --> 01:54.315
You dug?

01:54.532 --> 01:57.649
I did. With a shovel.
Dyson on the other hand...

01:58.452 --> 01:59.783
Mhmmm.
Took me back.

01:59.996 --> 02:01.532
Ya know, I used to
have a schnauzer who uh--

02:01.747 --> 02:03.157
Easy, easy.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.999
Bo.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.702
Where is she, Kenz?

02:09.922 --> 02:15.292
S-She um...
traded herself... for me.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.048
She traded herself? To who?

02:20.808 --> 02:22.048
[elevator ding]

02:57.178 --> 02:58.463
[BO] Kenzi?

03:06.562 --> 03:07.972
Hello?

03:14.737 --> 03:16.693
[30}
What the hell is this?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.792
[BO] l was never
any good at mazes.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.502
Maybe because you
never taught me how.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.968
Let's make up
for some lost time.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.092
Shall we...

03:44.308 --> 03:45.639
Dad?

03:45.851 --> 03:55.852
[music intensifies]

04:01.992 --> 04:02.401
[opening theme]

04:02.410 --> 04:06.995
[opening theme]

04:09.208 --> 04:11.073
Seriously? How bright
does that have to be?

04:11.293 --> 04:12.874
They're eyeballs. Move on.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.998
So, no clue as
to where Bo is?

04:15.214 --> 04:16.545
[KENZI] I was
she-handled by Valkyries,

04:16.757 --> 04:18.622
dragged out before I could see.

04:18.843 --> 04:19.923
[sighs] What do we do?

04:20.136 --> 04:22.297
Well first, we make
sure that you're okay.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.253
Dyson's very likely
back at the gates by now,

04:24.473 --> 04:27.385
making sure
they stay open for Bo.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.146
[LAUREN groans]

04:31.355 --> 04:32.640
The sphygmomanometer
goes next to the

04:32.857 --> 04:35.473
ophthalmoscope,
not the stethoscope.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.274
[groans]

04:37.486 --> 04:39.977
Sorry. New nurse.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.030
[KENZI] Whoa! Touch me with
that, you'll need a new nose.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.402
What? It's a
tongue depresser.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.482
My tongue's perfectly pressed.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.863
I've gotten major
compliments about it.

04:47.079 --> 04:50.571
And seriously, I'm fine.
Do I need to prancercise

04:50.791 --> 04:52.167
around your fancy
office to prove it?

04:52.376 --> 04:56.039
It's just a checkup.
Could you please just... please?

04:56.255 --> 04:57.165
You can check
me up all you want--

04:57.381 --> 04:59.793
without the
Dr. Giggles tools.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.838
[sighs]

05:04.054 --> 05:07.091
Crikey! Your hands are
colder than a yeti's snow nads.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.425
If it sounds like Kenzi
and it looks like Kenzi...

05:12.521 --> 05:15.888
Your heart is racing.

05:16.108 --> 05:16.972
Kenzi you're shaking.

05:17.193 --> 05:19.309
l'm Russian, I shake!

05:19.862 --> 05:22.103
I need a drink. Don't you
have any prescription vodka

05:22.323 --> 05:23.859
set aside for courage?

05:29.580 --> 05:31.286
Do yeti's chill
their nads on ice?

05:31.499 --> 05:32.363
[sighs] Did I mention

05:32.583 --> 05:33.914
how happy
lam to see you?

05:34.126 --> 05:35.536
Twice.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.546
Thanks for not removing
my liver, for like, science.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.174
Eh. Science couldn't
take the hangover.

05:52.228 --> 05:54.344
You know that she never
stopped looking for those shoes.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.224
[LAUREN] For a way to get there.
Not since the second--

05:56.440 --> 05:58.601
She's gonna be fine.
I can feel it in my gut.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.149
It's like she's...
right here beside us.

06:04.657 --> 06:06.238
[glass breaking]

06:07.284 --> 06:08.194
[LAUREN] Was that?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.071
[KENZI] Who dat?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.411
Do you think?

06:16.627 --> 06:17.992
No...

06:18.212 --> 06:20.203
Do you think?

06:21.090 --> 06:23.706
It just got
really cold in here.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.712
[squeaking]

06:25.928 --> 06:28.385
[KENZI] H-E...

06:28.597 --> 06:32.465
H-E-L! Oh my god,
she's in Hell?

06:32.685 --> 06:34.846
Or she needs help.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.764
Bo's a motherfae'n ghost.

06:40.985 --> 06:44.477
Yeah. Yeah,
it would appear so.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.195
Um, more vodka.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.289
I wouldn't do that.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.867
[STACEY] Unless you're
some sort of bearded Valkyrie

07:00.087 --> 07:03.796
I haven't heard of, you
shouldn't even be seeing this.

07:04.008 --> 07:06.249
I've seen a lot
of things I shouldn't've.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.050
But if you close this gate, you
may never see anything again.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.128
[chuckles]

07:11.348 --> 07:15.011
I think you're confusing
who can hurt who here.

07:16.145 --> 07:18.136
You want me to call my sisters?

07:18.355 --> 07:21.939
Well if they look anything
like you, be my guest.

07:22.151 --> 07:23.812
Stacey.

07:24.028 --> 07:25.438
[DYSON] Dyson.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.822
This is my first field
assignment in decades.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.740
Nice to get out of V fest.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.112
And what's the assignment?

07:33.329 --> 07:35.285
I need a
soul to replace this

07:35.497 --> 07:37.533
pocket Russian human.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.082
Since when do Valkyrie's
just arbitrarily take a soul?

07:40.294 --> 07:43.331
Since a succubus distrupted
the balance of Valhalla.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.541
You know her.

07:48.761 --> 07:49.671
[STACEY] Don't you?

07:49.887 --> 07:52.503
Everybody knows
the unaligned succubus.

07:52.723 --> 07:56.181
I need to find a
soul close to her heart.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.304
[STACEY] Freyja's request.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.932
Where's your heart, Dyson?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.686
Do you love her?

08:04.902 --> 08:07.564
I don't even know her.
Not really.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.987
[DYSON] But I know who does.

08:10.199 --> 08:14.192
Good. I didn't
wanna kill you anyway.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.322
Thank you.

08:17.873 --> 08:22.537
Holy Odin. Your jawline
is insanely distracting.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.294
I have work to do. See ya.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.590
Hey, how 'bout I
help you find your soul.

08:29.802 --> 08:32.214
I know this
territory inside and out.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.339
Let's go, partner.

08:45.818 --> 08:47.809

08:48.028 --> 08:49.609

08:49.822 --> 08:50.902

[KENZI'S VOICE]
Help me. Please.

08:56.787 --> 08:57.993
[BO] We had a deal
that you would be safe.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.661
We had a deal!

08:59.873 --> 09:01.909
[KENZI'S VOICE laughing]

09:02.126 --> 09:03.457
[BO] Not Kenzi.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.705

09:05.921 --> 09:06.580

09:08.799 --> 09:11.415

09:11.635 --> 09:14.502
[LAUREN'S VOICE]
She's gone. Bo's really gone.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.087
[KENZI'S VOICE] Oh, Lolo.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.056
[LAUREN'S VOICE]
I'm glad it's you who

09:17.266 --> 09:18.255
made it back and not her.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.261
[KENZI'S VOICE] Me too. We're all better off.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.513
[DYSON'S VOICE]
This calls for a celebration.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.143
We can finally
move on with our lives.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.225

Who's there?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.617
[MALE VOICE]
You aren't the chosen one.

09:45.836 --> 09:49.294
[BO] You're tryin'
to mess with my head.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.667
It's not gonna work.

[KENZI'S VOICE] You
just got bitch snacked.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.900
So you're the
cause of all this?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.195
Funny. I thought
you'd be scarier.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.613
[DYSON'S VOICE] And I
thought you'd be hotter.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.362
This coming from a
goblin with a wart on her wart.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.442
[LAUREN'S VOICE]
Can I have another bite?

10:20.662 --> 10:23.074
Whenever there're snacks in
the house, I just can't resist.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.700
Get back.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.784
[dove coos]

10:28.003 --> 10:29.504
I don't speak bird.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.374
[WOMAN] Is this better?

10:33.884 --> 10:35.499
[BO] Nice shift.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.755
[WOMAN] Walls of doubt
will entrap you if you let them.

10:37.971 --> 10:38.960
You must not listen.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.046
[DYSON'S VOICE]
Do us all a favor, Bo. Give up.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.096
Shut up.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.220
Puca is working with
the maze to keep you here.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.551
[WOMAN] To reveal the path,
you must choose what

10:45.771 --> 10:46.806
and what not to here.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.138
I don't need a life coach,
bird girl. I need a way out.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.144
Her true voice is the key.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.272
[LAUREN'S VOICE] I never
loved you Bo. Nobody does.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.150
[BO] Okay, now,
you're just making me mad.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.355
[BO grunts]
[PUCA groans]

10:58.575 --> 11:00.440
Right in the--you bitch!

11:00.661 --> 11:02.947
Puca punt. I win.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.326
[WOMAN] You've
conquered your doubts.

11:10.546 --> 11:12.286
You've defeated the maze.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.044
Some welcome wagon.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.550
[WOMAN] It is
the way of Tartarus.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.348
A prisoner can
go one of two ways.

11:25.561 --> 11:26.767
[BO] Which way did you go?

11:26.979 --> 11:28.389
[WOMAN] You're injured.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.723
[BO] Where is he?
Where's my father?

11:32.943 --> 11:35.355
[WOMAN] He can never
learn that I helped you.

11:35.571 --> 11:37.027
Come with me.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.780
[WOAN] Rest assure
you shall not perish.

11:39.992 --> 11:42.199
He will never afford
you that sweet release.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.366
[BO] I've been here before.

11:43.579 --> 11:46.412
[WOMAN] This is Tartarus.
A prison. A Hell.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.124
You came from Valhalla,
didn't you?

11:48.333 --> 11:51.871
[BO] No. That's not it. I
remember it from somewhere else.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.497
[WOMAN] You must
find a way out of here.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.921
Before this place
finds a way of keeping you.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.169
And trust me, it will.
It always does.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.969
No, I can't. Not yet.
I need to see him first.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.388
Not like this you can't.
I won't let you.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.480
Welcome home.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.906
Trickster!

12:23.118 --> 12:25.325
[KENZI] Right. Home.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.495
It's um, it's good to be back.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.119
[TRICK] A-Are you
sure this spirit was Bo?

12:31.335 --> 12:32.916
It communicated
with Lauren and me.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.629
And trust me, I know
about this stuff, Trick.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.578
I know a familiar
ghost when I see one.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.663
Well, not see but...

12:38.884 --> 12:40.044
y-y-you get it.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.501
Have you considered that
it could be something else?

12:42.721 --> 12:44.712
Ghost Dad? Ghost Swayze?

12:44.932 --> 12:47.218
[TRICK] No, there are Fae
spirits who become angry

12:47.434 --> 12:50.301
when they're improperly
entombed or disturbed.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.556
Bo gave up her
soul to save mine.

12:52.773 --> 12:53.762
And now she could
be trapped in some

12:53.982 --> 12:55.097
nether world
with Baddy Dearest;

12:55.317 --> 12:58.935
it's worth the risk. It won't
go Baba Yaga, I promise.

13:03.992 --> 13:08.952
I don't wanna leave you
alone with this. Where's Lauren?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.825
Upstairs washing
dirt out of places

13:11.041 --> 13:12.247
she didn't even know she had.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.575
And she's a doctor;
she knows all her places.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.160
Okay.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.495
I'm gonna head
back to my lair.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.625
See if I can come up
with anything else.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.968
Please be careful.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.384
Conjuring spirits is never simple.

13:24.596 --> 13:27.008
Nothing we
do ever really is, is it?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.218
--[WOMAN] Keep still!
--[BO grunts]

13:29.434 --> 13:31.049
[BO] Look, the whole
cloth in warm water thing

13:31.269 --> 13:33.134
works well in
story books, but,

13:33.355 --> 13:35.516
I might have
to do this my way.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.188
[WOMAN] You can heal yourself?

13:37.401 --> 13:41.690
[BO] Yeah. It takes two.
You wanna help?

13:41.905 --> 13:51.780
[BO breathing heavily]

14:09.141 --> 14:12.884
Shoveling plus
vodka equals woosy.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.222
Whoa.

14:15.439 --> 14:25.440
[alternative music plays]

15:36.228 --> 15:37.638
[KENZI] Got it!

15:40.148 --> 15:42.184
[LAUREN] Did you get it?
The ouija board? Oh you did.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.685
Bravo! Yay! [chuckles nervously]

15:43.902 --> 15:45.392
This is some seriously
spiritual shit that is

15:45.612 --> 15:46.692
in no way to be messed with.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.770
Entities that want to cross
back over from the spirit realm

15:48.990 --> 15:50.400
will say anything to
get you to help them.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.857
We have to make sure it's Bo.

15:52.077 --> 15:55.740
It's Bo. For sure.
I was just, um--

15:55.956 --> 15:59.494
you know, she was uh--

15:59.709 --> 16:01.836
We were, um...

16:02.045 --> 16:04.036
Oh!

16:04.256 --> 16:05.666
Ew!

16:07.300 --> 16:09.040
Okay, well at least you
weren't getting freaky

16:09.261 --> 16:10.717
with a decorative pillow.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.920
Vagimation received, Bobo.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.430
Let's get gypsy.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.636
[KENZI] Come on!

16:20.856 --> 16:23.893
Thank you. I needed that.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.521
One is always
starving in Tartarus.

16:26.736 --> 16:30.069
[WOMAN] The key is knowing
what and what not to eat.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.398
I remember this myth.

16:32.617 --> 16:37.907
My history teacher was this pro
rugby player with eyes like...

16:40.959 --> 16:45.043
The girl who ate six pomegranate
seeds. There's no way that you--

16:45.255 --> 16:48.839
[WOMAN] I am Persephone.
Daughter of Demeter.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.665
Wife of Hades.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.973
And I am your stepmother.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.598
[PERSEPHONE]
Wait. Please stop.

17:02.814 --> 17:03.644
[BO] It's gotta
be here somewhere.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.063
[PERSEPHONE] You don't
want to find him, Bo.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.812
He stole me away from my mother,
brought me to the underworld.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.690
[BO] I can't believe that
we're--And we really just--

17:10.906 --> 17:13.192
[PERSEPHONE] Listen to me!
Six thousand years I must

17:13.408 --> 17:15.444
dwell in the darkness,
then a mere six weeks

17:15.660 --> 17:18.902
back above ground.
You don't want to be here.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.157
Six thousand years?

17:20.373 --> 17:21.658
When my time comes,
the Artemis flame

17:21.875 --> 17:23.490
is the way out.
It belonged to my family,

17:23.710 --> 17:26.622
but he took it and
I haven't seen it since.

17:26.838 --> 17:27.793
Where is he?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.496
[PERSEPHONE] I don't know.
All I've heard is that

17:29.716 --> 17:31.877
he's very angry with you.

17:32.886 --> 17:36.344
He's angry with me?

17:37.474 --> 17:39.681
[BO] He tried to trick
me into ending the world.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.474
He lured my best
friend into a portal,

17:41.686 --> 17:42.937
so that I would go after her.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.603
And now, he sent his
child bride to seduce me.

17:45.815 --> 17:46.804
It never ends, does it?

17:47.025 --> 17:48.481
[PERSEPHONE] No, Bo.
He never sent me.

17:48.693 --> 17:49.808
I don't like
being jerked around.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.108
[PERSEPHONE]
It's not like that, please.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.528
When you get angry,
you look just like him.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.325
Help me find him.
I'm not scared.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.571
[PERSEPHONE] You should be.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.278
He's king of the underworld.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.988
Fae who is perceived as a god.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.699
He's an asshole,
perceived by me, as an asshole.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.752
[PERSEPHONE] Bo, you have
to get away before it holds you.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.374
No.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.711
[BO] Not until I've had my say.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.801
[BO] What's behind
door number spooky?

18:17.013 --> 18:18.969
[PERSEPHONE]
We can't go in there.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.844
[BO] All I heard is
that my father's on the

18:22.060 --> 18:24.267
other side of that door.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.890
[h uffs]

18:27.399 --> 18:28.855
What are we celebrating?

18:29.067 --> 18:31.604
Everyone's happy.
The end of the Una Mens.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.106
And that Evony is
no longer Morrigan.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.233
And all has become ground zero,

18:36.449 --> 18:40.658
for out territory's flirtations
with democrifacy if you will.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.155
Everyone wants to
fall into the footsteps of

18:42.372 --> 18:43.532
the unaligned succubus.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.239
This place smells so
much better than my bar.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.960
Good to know.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.501
Have you seen her?

18:50.714 --> 18:51.499
[DYSON] Not yet.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.673
Uh, Trick, this is Stacey.
She's new in town.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.547
Just introducing her
to some hearts and souls.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.254
Ah, well, let me
know if there's anything

19:01.474 --> 19:04.966
I can do to help...
accommodate.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.268
That's very kind
of you, barkeep.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.188
Was the her he
was talking about Bo?

19:11.401 --> 19:15.064
Yes. Everyone is very
curious as to her whereabouts.

19:15.280 --> 19:15.814
[STACEY] Mmm.

19:16.031 --> 19:20.445
Looked like he cares.
Might do for Freyja.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.824
Noble barkeep. Heart of gold.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.327
Heart of a drunk.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.956
Trick lives up to
his name. He's a liar.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.164
He's into some very
unsavory things. Pixies.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.372
[STACEY] At his age?

19:36.593 --> 19:40.962
[DYSON'S cell phone ringing]

19:43.266 --> 19:45.757
Okay. Boredom setting in.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.889
Cough it up. Who's my soul?

19:50.648 --> 19:53.685
Her lover. Her confidant.

19:53.902 --> 19:57.144
He fought by her side, she fed
off him when she needed it most.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.731
Even gave his love
to the Norn for her.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.818
Sounds like a tool. Where is he?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.869
He's the last of his kind.

20:07.082 --> 20:10.495
He's a mesmer.
Goes by the name Vex.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.247
What do you say you
and I go fetch him?

20:13.463 --> 20:16.580
There's something
I need to do first.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.971
I just had to make sure you
weren't that guy who loved Bo.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.518
[TAMSIN] Dyson.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.686
Step away from the skank.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.400
Tamsin.

20:34.609 --> 20:35.473
--[TAMS|N] Hi.
--[DYSON] Hi.

20:35.693 --> 20:36.978
Nice to find you
playing tonsil hockey with--

20:37.195 --> 20:41.108
Your successor? Just 'cause
you couldn't finish the job.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.439
What job?

20:42.659 --> 20:43.648
The job I never finished.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.530
I always finish my jobs.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.453
[TAMSIN] I was
recalled on my mission...

20:49.666 --> 20:52.373
to return Bo to her father.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.995
What?

20:56.548 --> 20:57.207
[TAMSIN] Uh!

20:57.424 --> 20:59.005
I can't believe you
betrayed Bo, again!

20:59.217 --> 21:01.583
[TAMSIN] I went there to help.
It was activated by him,

21:01.803 --> 21:02.553
like some sleeper spell.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.751
And don't change the subject.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.304
You were just sucking face
with my very evil sister.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.256
Sister?

21:08.476 --> 21:10.888
Augh, that's... not right.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.645
She took my phone.

21:17.861 --> 21:20.898
[sighs] Dyson, you need to
get back to the Valhalla gates,

21:21.114 --> 21:22.069
and quick, before they close.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.362
[TAMSIN]
It's Bo's only way out.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.816
What are you going
to do about your sister?

21:26.035 --> 21:27.571
Don't worry about her.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.324
I've been wanting to school
that wench since Valkyrie High.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.879
I know this place.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.596
During my dawning.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.476
This is where I was...

22:04.657 --> 22:07.194
l was born in Hell.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.155
[PERSEPHONE] They only
let her hold you to feed you.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.163
[BO] Aife.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.458
I remember when
he brought her here.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.661
I used to hear her
wails through the vents.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.587
I don't think
I can listen to this.

22:21.799 --> 22:22.879
Hades would gloat about what

22:23.092 --> 22:24.832
his daughter would become.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.714
[PERSEPHONE]
A queen capable of

22:26.930 --> 22:29.467
dominion over life and death.

22:29.682 --> 22:34.176
There were guards then.
A midwife, lots of people.

22:34.395 --> 22:37.933
But they fled when Hades
began to lose his power.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.313
I won't stop until he's
as powerless as she was.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.516
Oh, Mom.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.099
She meant to have you two
leave this place together.

23:23.319 --> 23:24.149
[PERSEPHONE]
When the time came,

23:24.362 --> 23:26.523
she realized only
one could escape.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.900
So she let you go.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.075
She loved me.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.152
My mother did too.

23:34.372 --> 23:37.239
Before Hades
took me away from her.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.293
If this is another trick,

23:43.506 --> 23:44.621
I will pluck out
every single one

23:44.841 --> 23:46.797
of your pretty little feathers.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.001
Do you know what
Hades would do if he knew

23:49.220 --> 23:51.427
I led his daughter down here?

23:51.639 --> 23:54.472
Thirty years of
missed birthdays?

23:54.684 --> 23:57.426
I think he can
pony up for one candle.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.181
[PERSEPHONE] You must
find another way out.

23:59.397 --> 24:00.432
He takes no company.

24:00.648 --> 24:04.311
[BO] I am not company,
Persephone.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.768
I am the one
he's been waiting for.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.732
[PERSEPHONE] The Artemis
moon candle was the last thing

24:08.948 --> 24:11.781
my monther gave me before
the Earth swallowed me whole.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.699
[BO] Like in Tremors.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.867
Kenzi's second favorite
Kevin Bacon movie.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.661
[PERSEPHONE] Demeter knew
that Hades abhors light,

24:17.874 --> 24:19.455
and that it could
illuminate my way home.

24:19.667 --> 24:20.907
[BO] So where does Pops keep it?

24:21.127 --> 24:23.618
Ajunk drawer?
A tool box in the garage?

24:24.505 --> 24:26.541
[elevator dings]

24:35.475 --> 24:38.387
Persephone,
I'm sorry about earlier.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.843
I'm not sure I could
have been as brave as

24:40.063 --> 24:41.724
you've been in this place.

24:41.939 --> 24:45.306
I heard tales of your
courage, your bravery,

24:45.526 --> 24:48.108
battling all
that you had to face.

24:48.321 --> 24:51.404
I figured, so could I.

24:54.077 --> 25:04.078
[eerie music plays]

25:39.080 --> 25:41.196
[elevator dings]

25:53.136 --> 25:55.798
I can hear you breathing, Dad.

25:58.349 --> 26:01.216
Dad.

26:01.436 --> 26:04.473
I have waited
so long to say that.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.645
To talk to you.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.445
Wondering who you really are.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.613
Are you gonna
come out and face me?

26:22.290 --> 26:26.579
You've been
hiding all these years.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.035
[30}
Why would that change now?

26:35.011 --> 26:39.425
You're not my family.
You're nothing.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.507
You're darkness and
I'm not walking into it.

26:44.479 --> 26:47.186
[BO] Keep hiding.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.480
I don't wanna meet you.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.808
I never wanna meet you.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.321
[BO] I am not going to
jeopardize the people who

26:54.530 --> 26:58.364
truly love me back
home just to meet you.

27:00.036 --> 27:04.075
I don't need to know who
you are to know myself.

27:04.290 --> 27:08.875
[BO] If you wanna see me,
it'll be on my terms

27:09.086 --> 27:13.625
with my true family who
would never abandon me.

27:13.841 --> 27:28.689
[eerie music plays]

27:28.898 --> 27:31.310
I will never be what
you want me to be.

27:34.987 --> 27:39.856
What I am gonna do,
is take everything you have.

27:43.746 --> 27:47.284
If you don't like it...

27:47.500 --> 27:48.831
come and get me.

27:58.803 --> 28:02.842
[heavy breathing]

28:08.729 --> 28:13.189
No. Not like this. Not from you.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.981
You're not a god,
you're a coward.

28:18.197 --> 28:22.110
But not me. Because my
mother taught me how to fight.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.736
[grunts]

28:25.705 --> 28:29.994
[panting]

28:30.209 --> 28:33.667
[crying]

28:33.880 --> 28:34.619
[KENZI] So are you
going to swallow the

28:34.839 --> 28:36.249
ritual blood sausage willingly,

28:36.465 --> 28:38.456
or am I gonna have
to hold you down?

28:38.968 --> 28:40.959
You are gonna have
to hold me down. Yep.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.167
Are you kidding me?

28:42.388 --> 28:44.629
Dude, I grew up séancing
the shit out of spirits.

28:44.849 --> 28:48.512
Right now Bo's all
spirity and invisibly.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.060
[KENZI] Once we're done, she'll
be back to her fully formed,

28:51.272 --> 28:54.514
chi sucking, gravity defying,
sex maneuvering self.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.190
Right. I think we
should wait for Trick.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.266
There's no time.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.899
Bobo, put on your jeggings,
we're bringing you home.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.571
Okay.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.034
Now...

29:04.243 --> 29:06.859
I need you to, um, give me
your cold, clamy hands

29:07.079 --> 29:08.740
and close your eyes.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.531
[KENZI exhales]

29:11.751 --> 29:18.418
Vykhodi. Vykhodi.
Iz teni, v svet. Vykhodi.

29:18.633 --> 29:24.924
Vykhodi. Vykhodi.
Iz teni, v svet. Vykhodi.

29:28.351 --> 29:29.386
[LAUREN] It's working.

29:29.602 --> 29:35.142
Vykhodi. Vykhodi.
Iz teni, v svet. Vykhodi.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.735
[KENZI] Bobes?

29:42.573 --> 29:43.483
[BO] I hope you
packed your charger.

29:43.699 --> 29:44.404
I always forget it.

29:44.617 --> 29:45.322
[PERSEPHONE] What'd you do?

29:45.534 --> 29:46.910
[B0] The opposite of
what he wanted me to do.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.620
We're leaving. Now.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.115
[PERSEPHONE] That's not for me.
Not yet. It's for you.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.323
[BO] There's gotta
be a way. Come on.

29:53.542 --> 29:56.454
I've got your candle.
Your way out. Let's go.

29:56.671 --> 30:00.084
I found the center of the maze.
The hotel. I can't leave.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.164
Not until my six
thousand years are up.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.501
Only you have the Helskor.
Only you are the one.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.302
Bullshit. I have
never been just one.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.506
I only win because the
people who stand with me.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.761
[BO] I will not leave
anyone else behind.

30:13.229 --> 30:14.264
This is as far as I can go.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.185
[BO] No, you're coming.

30:15.398 --> 30:17.514
Light this when you
get home. For my family.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.688
[PERSEPHONE]
So they know I'm safe.

30:18.901 --> 30:20.812
I never stop thinking of them.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.108
I'll get you out of here.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.481
You have to go, now.

30:23.698 --> 30:24.778
What will he do to you?

30:24.991 --> 30:27.277
Your father lost interest
in me a long time ago.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.859
Besides, I've gotten
very good at hiding.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.529
I promise I'll light the candle.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.740
It's important to
let the light in, Bo.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.293
Sometimes that's all it
takes to keep the evil at bay.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.672
[KENZI] That thing is fast.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.594
Did you by chance
disturb a grave or anything

30:49.807 --> 30:50.557
when you dug me up?

30:50.766 --> 30:52.222
No. Dyson did
most of the digging.

30:52.435 --> 30:53.220
It's not Bo.

30:53.436 --> 30:56.724
Trick said we may have angered
a buried spirit or something.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.850
I must have broken
it's urn without knowing it.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.977
What?! We're being
hella haunted because of

31:01.193 --> 31:02.524
a shard in your pocket?

31:02.737 --> 31:04.022
I should have known. And a demu.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.024
I just--| wanted it
so badly to be Bo.

31:06.240 --> 31:06.945
You had sex with it.

31:07.158 --> 31:08.398
It kissed my neck.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.073
And now it's caught in
Trick's divination board

31:10.286 --> 31:12.197
and we have to destroy it.

31:12.413 --> 31:13.277
[clanking]

31:13.497 --> 31:17.160
That's it. I'm gonna go for it.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.871
[growling]

31:24.091 --> 31:26.252
Okay. Retreat, retreat,
retreat, retreat.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.300
[KENZI whimpers]

31:32.975 --> 31:36.763
[DYSON snarling]

31:37.813 --> 31:39.189
Nice grip, Hercules.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.104
Thanks. Glad you could make it.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.649
When you pled
fealty you meant it, huh?

31:43.861 --> 31:46.227
Yeah. Do you mind?

31:46.447 --> 31:47.857
[BO] Oh.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.614
[DYSON grunts]

31:59.335 --> 32:01.542
Thanks for waiting.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.415
Always.

32:04.882 --> 32:07.043
--[DYSON] Shall we?
--[BO] Yeah.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.720
That's it. I'm goin' in.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.844
Please don't die.

32:16.060 --> 32:16.924
Okay.

32:17.144 --> 32:22.013
[yelling]

32:22.233 --> 32:25.145
[LAUREN] You piece-of-shit,
nap-disturbing predator!

32:29.782 --> 32:31.989
[low growl]

32:33.494 --> 32:38.534
[BOTH panting]

32:38.749 --> 32:42.241
That definitely was not Bo.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.042
Where is she, Lauren?

32:44.255 --> 32:46.746
[door opens]

32:53.889 --> 32:58.303
Hello Bo-friends. I need
to feast on one of your souls.

32:58.519 --> 32:59.975
Any volunteers?

33:02.940 --> 33:06.148
Can you believe the
shifter tried to sell Vex

33:06.360 --> 33:07.941
as a soul Bo gave a shit about?

33:08.154 --> 33:09.644
Yeah, well, they have
shared undergarments.

33:09.864 --> 33:14.699
[STACEY] Lucky for me Dyson's
text history details Bo's love

33:14.910 --> 33:17.196
of the uppity doctor, Lauren.

33:17.413 --> 33:18.402
Dyson texts about you?

33:18.622 --> 33:19.657
I don't know.

33:19.874 --> 33:22.240
[STACEY] I can make this
fast or I can make this slow.

33:22.459 --> 33:25.622
I'm in no hurry to get
back to my shift in Valhalla.

33:25.838 --> 33:26.827
The tips are shit.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.833
Look, if anybody
is going, it's me.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.084
Kenzi's been through enough.

33:30.301 --> 33:31.040
[KENZI] I bit portal and died.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.921
I did not lose
my lady balls. I'll go.

33:33.137 --> 33:35.594
Oh, you know what?
The doctor's right.

33:35.806 --> 33:38.422
Bo and Freyja made
a deal. You're off limits.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.473
[STACEY] This is better anyway.

33:40.686 --> 33:44.895
You hold a particularly
special place in Bo's heart.

33:45.107 --> 33:45.857
That was a gift.

33:46.066 --> 33:47.146
Give it back. Now.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.565
Nap time.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.984
Or whatevs. Good luck, Lo.

33:53.908 --> 33:55.614
You can't have my
soul if I'm not dead.

33:55.826 --> 33:56.815
That can be arranged.

33:57.036 --> 33:57.775
[LAUREN] Ah!

33:57.995 --> 33:58.950
[TAMSIN] Let her go, Stacey.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.528
I beg your pardon?

34:00.748 --> 34:02.284
You're going back
to Freyja empty handed.

34:02.499 --> 34:04.876
See what it's like to be
in her bad books for once.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.827
Valhalla's books will
still be unbalanced.

34:08.047 --> 34:12.006
Well, so are my boobs.
But I make do.

34:12.218 --> 34:16.757
[STACEY] Oh, Tamsin.
On your last life, are you sure

34:16.972 --> 34:20.590
you wanna pick mortals
over your Valkyrie sisters?

34:20.809 --> 34:23.061
Oh, Stacey.
Do you really consider

34:23.270 --> 34:24.806
those girls your sisters?

34:25.022 --> 34:26.228
Maybe you should ask
them who coined the term

34:26.440 --> 34:27.941
"Brace Face Stace" in high school.

34:28.150 --> 34:28.935
[KENZI] Are they having a--

34:29.151 --> 34:30.266
[LAUREN] Yeah.
Valkyrie on Valkyrie--

34:30.486 --> 34:31.350
[KENZI] Doubt off.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.480
[LAUREN] Right.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.561
I'm just trying to be
a good friend here,

34:34.782 --> 34:35.897
but I think you should know

34:36.116 --> 34:40.359
they call you the doormat
at Valhalla's gates.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.537
Don't you think you should
stand up for yourself?

34:44.541 --> 34:45.872
And I wanna be an
equally good friend,

34:46.085 --> 34:47.245
and tell you should
look in the mirror

34:47.461 --> 34:50.077
because the Rachel
is so last century.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.912
Plus your roots are showing.

34:53.092 --> 34:58.587
You know the rules.
A Valkyrie's hair is off limits!

35:00.933 --> 35:01.843
[STACEY] I'll be back.

35:02.059 --> 35:03.640
I'll be here.

35:05.771 --> 35:06.931
[door slams shut]

35:07.147 --> 35:10.981
Tamsin, Tamsin? Or Tamsin
from The Shining?

35:11.193 --> 35:13.184
Tamsin, Tamsin.

35:16.323 --> 35:19.531
[roots rock music begins]

35:19.743 --> 35:22.485
[TRICK] To Kenzi. And to Bo.

35:22.705 --> 35:24.115
And to all of you brave warriors

35:24.331 --> 35:25.662
who helped bring them home.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.911
I've never met a
stronger united force.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.413
Now we drink?

35:30.629 --> 35:31.539
[TRICK] And now we drink.

35:31.755 --> 35:32.540
[DYSON] Here, here.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.337
[LAUREN, KENZI,
and TAMSIN] Cheers!

35:38.929 --> 35:40.465
Truce?

35:40.681 --> 35:42.763
Come on. I was alone with
a Valkyrie. I improvised.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.512
Yeah. All over Stacey's mouth.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.978
Good job.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.350
Yeah?

35:51.567 --> 35:54.354
Plus, I'm not jealous. Trust me.

35:54.570 --> 35:55.980
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

35:56.196 --> 35:57.732
Friends?

35:57.948 --> 35:58.812
[DYSON] Friends.

35:59.033 --> 36:00.489
[chuckles]

36:02.202 --> 36:03.612
Welcome home, love.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.913
[TRICK] Two thousand years.
Ten thousand books.

36:12.129 --> 36:15.713
And yet, the afterlife
remains a mystery, even to me.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.539
What's it like?

36:19.219 --> 36:23.713
It's um... personal.

36:27.561 --> 36:28.676
[DYSON] I have
something for you.

36:28.896 --> 36:32.514
Oh, please be a hoverboard.
Please be a hoverboard.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.269
[DYSON] It's from Hale.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.947
He left it for you in his will.

36:48.082 --> 36:53.372
I felt close to him for a second.
And Dyson, he was happy.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.715
[LAUREN] There's an impeccable
selection of vintage cabs in

37:00.928 --> 37:04.466
the keg room actually dating
all the way back to, um...

37:04.681 --> 37:07.058
I just happened to find a few...

37:07.267 --> 37:12.603
when I was in there...
one time. I'll get one.

37:12.815 --> 37:14.430
I'll help.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.069
[BO] I can't believe
that you had ghost sex.

37:25.285 --> 37:29.324
[LAUREN chuckles] Well it had
some patented Bo moves.

37:30.666 --> 37:32.952
So how is back-to-life Kenzi?

37:33.168 --> 37:35.204
She's good.
Her vitals are in check.

37:35.421 --> 37:40.541
No, I mean... Valhalla.
An almost wedding to Hale.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.002
That's a lot. Y'know I just...

37:46.473 --> 37:47.553
I don't know.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.098
You should talk to her.

37:52.771 --> 37:56.980
So you burnt the ouija board
once the spirit became trapped?

37:57.192 --> 37:58.978
[heavy exhale sound]

37:59.194 --> 38:01.025
Since when can you burn a ghost?

38:01.238 --> 38:02.023
I'm not following.

38:02.239 --> 38:04.104
No. It's following you.

38:04.658 --> 38:05.568
[LAUREN] Uh!
[yelling]

38:05.784 --> 38:07.740
[gunshot]

38:12.291 --> 38:13.827
[LAUREN] I thought we burnt it.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.998
I guess we gave
it corporeal form.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.463
Shouldda given it a makeover.

38:18.672 --> 38:20.253
How did you know?

38:20.466 --> 38:22.172
[LAUREN] How'd you
know it wasn't over?

38:22.384 --> 38:26.423
That's the thing with
the Fae, it's never over.

38:28.599 --> 38:32.512
[BO] Okay, we've got Chardonnay,
licorice, Tremors--

38:32.728 --> 38:33.968
your second fav Bacon flick--

38:34.188 --> 38:36.804
and Footloose,
your number one favorite--

38:37.024 --> 38:38.764
well, it's everyone's
number one favorite.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.270
Bo, I can't.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.146
What's goin' on?

38:46.366 --> 38:48.573
I can't keep being a lost
human in the Fae world

38:48.785 --> 38:50.446
trying to be Fae.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.448
I'm not Fae.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.040
[BO] That has never
mattered to me.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.581
But it does to me.

38:56.793 --> 39:00.411
I have learned so much
from you--from everyone.

39:01.632 --> 39:04.965
But I just lost the
love of my life, Bo.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.683
I... died.

39:17.898 --> 39:20.014
Hey, but now you are here.

39:20.234 --> 39:22.976
[KENZI] Which is why
I have a second chance.

39:23.195 --> 39:26.312
And I need to try something new.

39:26.532 --> 39:31.322
Something... for me.
Something human.

39:32.746 --> 39:37.035
And for the first time in
I don't even remember,

39:37.251 --> 39:40.118
I'm okay with that.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.623
I need to go.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.542
[BO] Kenzi.

40:19.751 --> 40:23.619
Hale left me some Santiago
land off the coast of Spain.

40:23.839 --> 40:26.956
Wow. You've never even
been out of the country.

40:27.175 --> 40:31.293
Never even had a legitimate
passport. Seems like a sign.

40:50.032 --> 40:53.820
We're sisters. We're in
each other's lives for good.

40:54.036 --> 40:56.652
Hell, I couldn't even keep
you out of my afterlife.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.705
I love you, Kenzi.

41:10.218 --> 41:15.429
Sometimes I think it's the only
thing I'm completely sure about.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.469
Bye, Bo.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.359
Goodbye, Kenzi.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.121
[elevator dings]

42:24.334 --> 42:26.199
I know, baby. But
the deposition was like,

42:26.420 --> 42:29.503
two hundred pages long,
and the copier was...

42:29.715 --> 42:32.832
It was evil. Stone cold evil.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.838
Anyway, um, please,
please tell me that you

42:36.054 --> 42:37.385
ordered salads for dinner.

42:37.597 --> 42:41.215
And by salads of course
I mean two all meat pizzas.

42:45.564 --> 42:50.854
[whispering]

43:31.818 --> 43:35.777
[screaming]

43:35.989 --> 43:40.983
[ending theme]
