WEBVTT

00:04.259 --> 00:05.992
Hmm.

00:06.026 --> 00:07.343
Shirley, did you ever date
Roger Ebert?

00:07.377 --> 00:09.458
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

00:09.793 --> 00:10.959
Britta, did you ever
take pictures of your feet

00:10.994 --> 00:12.227
and post them on the Internet
for money?

00:12.262 --> 00:13.862
Sha-ha!
No.

00:13.897 --> 00:16.331
Guys, this history final
is going to be killer.

00:16.383 --> 00:17.783
We have to study.

00:17.817 --> 00:19.284
It's no fair
Professor Cornwallis

00:19.319 --> 00:21.053
turned all hard-assed again.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.023
Lucky Pierce.

00:22.143 --> 00:24.073
Donating his kidney to Gilbert
to get out of it.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.741
I never thought
he'd be that generous.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.259
Although,
he did seem disappointed

00:27.293 --> 00:28.494
that the operation
didn't involve

00:28.528 --> 00:29.762
sleeping with a Russian woman,

00:29.796 --> 00:30.813
then waking up
in a bathtub full of ice.

00:30.847 --> 00:31.897
- Hmm.
- Guys!

00:31.931 --> 00:32.506
- Hmm?
- History!

00:32.540 --> 00:33.644
I am studying history.

00:33.833 --> 00:34.545
I'm studying our history.

00:34.608 --> 00:36.852
- Abed!
- Nobody bite.

00:36.886 --> 00:38.353
We agreed no biting.

00:38.388 --> 00:39.838
But, Jeff,
it's a graduation gift.

00:39.872 --> 00:41.473
You see, on the surface we seem
like just a group of people

00:41.508 --> 00:43.876
from diverse backgrounds who
have become unlikely friends.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.227
But according to my research,

00:45.261 --> 00:46.979
our paths have crossed
many times.

00:47.013 --> 00:49.093
We were destined to meet.
Like a team of superheroes.

00:49.099 --> 00:51.717
This is our origin story.

00:51.751 --> 00:53.975
And here...we...go.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.704
Abed, we don't have
origin stories.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.056
We have lives.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.058
Well, at least--

01:00.660 --> 01:02.211
yep, just me.

01:02.245 --> 01:03.795
So you're saying
we're all connected

01:03.813 --> 01:05.513
like the classic
French film trilogy

01:05.548 --> 01:07.616
<i>Bleu, Blanc, Rouge?</i>

01:07.650 --> 01:08.751
No, like something
more accessible.

01:08.785 --> 01:10.102
- Like <i>Unbreakable.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

01:10.136 --> 01:11.937
Abed, I know
it's disappointing to you,

01:11.971 --> 01:13.288
but we're not superheroes.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.290
This is the real world,
not some comic book adventure.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.961
I've done it.
I've infiltrated the school.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.712
I've learned its secrets.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.514
I've gained everyone's trust.

01:22.549 --> 01:25.734
And now, on the anniversary
of my empire's destruction,

01:25.769 --> 01:27.319
vengeance will be mine.

01:27.353 --> 01:30.172
No, vengeance will be ours.

01:30.206 --> 01:34.276
Okay, can you stop that?
It really creeps me out.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.695
I'm sorry.
Just really love this thing.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.547

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:06.676 --> 02:08.460
I've been doing exhaustive
research into our lives.

02:08.478 --> 02:10.062
Once I find the last
one or two missing pieces,

02:10.096 --> 02:12.397
I'll have conclusive proof that
we were all destined to meet.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.082
This is how
we're all connected.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.034
I call it the crazy quilt
of destiny

02:16.052 --> 02:17.736
mainly because the loom of fate
was already taken.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.037
- Really?
- Look.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.272
I don't care what tricks
or nonsense you have

02:20.290 --> 02:21.957
in your scrapbook,
Martha Stewart,

02:21.991 --> 02:23.342
but there's no way
you're gonna get me to believe

02:23.376 --> 02:26.395
there's some outside force
controlling my destiny.

02:26.429 --> 02:27.779
And I think you used
that particular phrasing

02:27.813 --> 02:29.448
because I know
you've seen <i>Star Wars.</i>

02:29.482 --> 02:31.650
Everybody's seen <i>Star Wars.</i>

02:31.684 --> 02:33.818
Yes, but you first saw it
when it was re-released in 1982

02:33.837 --> 02:36.254
at the Greendale Palladium
at 4:15 in the afternoon.

02:36.272 --> 02:37.573
And it was the best time
you ever had with your father.

02:37.607 --> 02:38.891
How did you know that?

02:38.925 --> 02:41.126
You keep this ticket stub
in your wallet.

02:41.144 --> 02:42.928
Abed, you can't--

02:42.962 --> 02:45.197
- Give it back!
- Whoa!

02:45.231 --> 02:47.533
Our story begins in
the distant mists of a lost era:

02:47.567 --> 02:50.185
2008.

02:52.055 --> 02:54.423
I know you're all wondering
how I do it.

02:54.457 --> 02:57.993
How do I balance straight As,
extracurriculars,

02:58.027 --> 03:00.679
and Israeli folk dancing
every Friday night?

03:00.713 --> 03:05.834
It's a simple matter
of organization,

03:05.885 --> 03:10.439
dedication, and...

03:16.863 --> 03:18.730
And we're back!

03:18.748 --> 03:20.699
Then I drink your milkshake.

03:22.101 --> 03:24.102
Ah, that will never get old.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.787
You guys gotta see my <i>Juno.</i>

03:25.822 --> 03:27.155
Hey, Troy.

03:27.190 --> 03:29.358
So I heard you weren't
doing that great in algebra,

03:29.392 --> 03:32.277
and you know,
if you need a tutor for math,

03:32.295 --> 03:33.812
I'd be happy to help.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.130
I'm being recruited
by colleges to play football.

03:35.164 --> 03:36.949
- Oh.
- I don't have time for math.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.318
The only thing that matters
to me are statistics.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.602
Ooh!

03:40.637 --> 03:42.688
Uh, that's also a type of math.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.225
But we already knew
I went to high school with Troy,

03:46.259 --> 03:48.377
and it's not like he even
remembered I existed.

03:48.411 --> 03:49.828
Yeah, I don't remember her
at all.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.163
We should probably drop this.

03:51.197 --> 03:52.558
Wait, where's Pierce
on this chart?

03:52.582 --> 03:53.599
His contribution to the group

03:53.633 --> 03:54.816
has already been noted.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.068
Pierce Hawthorne.
Fixture at Greendale.

03:56.102 --> 03:57.219
Unavoidable.

03:57.253 --> 03:59.170
- Hey, is that a sad face?
- I wouldn't know.

03:59.188 --> 04:00.772
You have to look deeper.
Here. Take this, for example.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.124
It's a receipt I found

04:02.158 --> 04:03.442
in the back of Shirley's
sock drawer on Thanksgiving.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.396
You went in my bedroom
for some comic book thing?

04:05.411 --> 04:07.846
Oh, no, my feet were cold.
Ah, here.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.281
- You should probably wash those.
- Oh.

04:09.299 --> 04:10.582
Discovering the receipt
was dumb luck,

04:10.600 --> 04:11.833
but it proves
that we were at the mall

04:11.868 --> 04:13.535
on the exact same day.

04:13.569 --> 04:14.786
Shirley, do remember
what you bought for $54

04:14.820 --> 04:15.971
at the Love Hut?

04:16.005 --> 04:18.273
What? Hmm?
No.

04:18.308 --> 04:21.259
So excited about tonight,
honey.

04:21.277 --> 04:22.811
Uh-huh. It's been too long

04:22.862 --> 04:26.331
since we had adult time
without the kids.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.699
Oh!

04:27.733 --> 04:31.369
Well, I may have an anniversary
surprise for you too.

04:31.387 --> 04:33.138
Well, I'm in public, but, uh...

04:33.172 --> 04:34.273
you know you gonna get it,
right?

04:34.307 --> 04:37.542
You gonna get it!

04:39.112 --> 04:41.980
So we were at the mall
on the same day.

04:42.014 --> 04:44.816
<i>Unbreakable.</i>

04:44.834 --> 04:46.318
Mail call.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.553
That's all right.
Won't be needing it today.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.689
But Kevin always takes
the mail.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.424
Well, today's mail's
kind of important.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.926
It's the day that I send in
Greendale's lease renewal.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.895
Lease re-new-al?

04:56.913 --> 04:58.213
It's a critical document.

04:58.247 --> 05:00.248
See, Greendale sublets our land
from the Arapaho nation.

05:00.283 --> 05:01.733
Ah.

05:01.767 --> 05:03.802
Miss a renewal and faster
than you can say "wounded knee,"

05:03.836 --> 05:07.856
we turn into a casino
and midsize concert venue.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.392
So you only trust me
with busywork?

05:10.443 --> 05:13.762
Oh, no, that's not--

05:13.796 --> 05:16.231
Kevin, ah--

05:16.265 --> 05:18.183
I cannot resist
those puppy dog eyes.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.185
Here.

05:20.219 --> 05:22.287
Ah! Now, I have time
to hit the seamstress.

05:26.275 --> 05:29.628
Guess all I have to say
is "Ladies and gentlemen,

05:29.662 --> 05:33.498
Greendale Resort and Casino
presents Steve Winwood."

05:33.533 --> 05:35.400
Okay, I just need to find
the one last smoking gun,

05:35.435 --> 05:36.768
and I think this might be it.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.970
I found it in a copy of
the Greendale communist worker.

05:38.988 --> 05:40.105
Look familiar?

05:40.123 --> 05:41.907
Oh, my God.

05:41.941 --> 05:45.377
This is me and my anarchist
collective at the courthouse.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.362
We called ourselves
the An-her-chists.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.048
Did you guys know
that Jeff's in that photo?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.683
What!

05:51.701 --> 05:53.568
Jeff. My man.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.153
Congrats on getting
your case thrown out.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.805
Your argument
was a masterpiece.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.757
I mean,
it was definitely creative.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.359
Creative?

06:00.393 --> 06:02.344
He convinced a judge
to forgive five years back taxes

06:02.378 --> 06:03.845
by getting him to agree

06:03.896 --> 06:05.947
that you humping an American
flag to <i>Back In Black</i>

06:05.982 --> 06:07.149
was not stripping

06:07.183 --> 06:10.085
but actually not-for-profit
performance art.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.420
Ch-chk...Boom!

06:11.454 --> 06:12.721
Blew me away.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.022
Come on, let's go!

06:14.057 --> 06:15.123
Thank you.

06:15.158 --> 06:16.708
Thank you for defending
a woman's right

06:16.743 --> 06:18.577
to use her body
however she chooses.

06:18.611 --> 06:22.114
I can honestly say that right
is very important to me.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.198
Aw!

06:23.232 --> 06:24.983
Excuse me, Mr. Winger,
can we get a--

06:25.017 --> 06:26.017
You're a hero.
Hi.

06:26.035 --> 06:27.002
Hi.

06:27.036 --> 06:28.286
Guys!

06:28.320 --> 06:30.655
We have got
to capitalize on this momentum.

06:30.673 --> 06:33.024
It is time An-her-chists
finally takes a stand

06:33.059 --> 06:34.709
on animals rights.

06:34.744 --> 06:36.845
There is a medical lab
in an office building nearby.

06:36.879 --> 06:38.780
Next week,
I say we break in there--

06:38.815 --> 06:40.749
Actually, we were thinking
this is our last hurrah.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.534
But this was our first hurrah.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.619
- We're just getting going.
- Britta, we're done.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.004
I had a hamburger
the other day,

06:46.038 --> 06:47.405
and suddenly I'm not cold
all the time.

06:47.423 --> 06:51.343
Fine. Go.
I don't need you.

06:51.377 --> 06:55.630
What's an anarchist to do
without her organization?

06:56.716 --> 06:59.618
Jeffrey, how could you?

06:59.652 --> 07:01.013
Well, I was
a really good lawyer.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.588
Mysti is the stripper
that Andre cheated on me with,

07:03.606 --> 07:05.474
and you defended her.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.258
Shirley, I--

07:07.276 --> 07:08.927
If you hadn't gotten
that homewrecker off,

07:08.945 --> 07:11.196
Andre never would've met her.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.712
Jeff ends Shirley's marriage.

07:13.832 --> 07:15.934
See? I told you
we were always destined to meet.

07:15.952 --> 07:16.868
Hmm.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.276
Usually Jeff went to the same rec center,

07:20.318 --> 07:21.674
but I had no idea
their paths crossed again.

07:21.914 --> 07:23.114
This is good.
This is really great.

07:23.149 --> 07:24.432
We're really filling in
some plot holes here.

07:24.467 --> 07:25.750
This is good stuff.
It's really good.

07:25.785 --> 07:27.001
Have I missed something?

07:27.036 --> 07:29.220
These aren't plot holes, Abed.
This is my life.

07:29.255 --> 07:30.405
But this kinda connection

07:30.439 --> 07:31.673
only makes our origin story
more compelling.

07:31.707 --> 07:33.091
Like how awesome it is

07:33.125 --> 07:34.175
when Uncle Ben is murdered
in <i>Spider-Man.</i>

07:34.210 --> 07:35.593
- Hmm.
- My marriage almost ended.

07:35.628 --> 07:36.778
If it weren't for Jeff,

07:36.812 --> 07:38.346
that Jezebel
would've been in jail

07:38.381 --> 07:39.814
instead of between
my Laura Ashley sheets.

07:39.849 --> 07:42.133
Hey, this is not my fault.

07:42.168 --> 07:43.318
And by the way,

07:43.352 --> 07:44.853
the case didn't work out
too great for me either.

07:44.887 --> 07:46.705
It was supposed to make
my career,

07:46.739 --> 07:48.356
but it put a target on my back.

07:52.211 --> 07:54.179
Michael Phelps, really?

07:54.213 --> 07:55.563
And it doesn't affect
his breathing?

07:55.598 --> 07:57.015
Nope.

07:57.049 --> 07:58.767
Mysti, can I talk to Jeff
for a moment?

07:58.801 --> 08:02.871
I will go, uh, powder my nose.

08:02.905 --> 08:05.423
For real.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.725
Listen.

08:06.759 --> 08:08.543
There's this rumor
going around the firm

08:08.577 --> 08:10.829
that you never received
an undergraduate degree.

08:10.863 --> 08:13.098
- That's ridiculous.
- I know.

08:13.132 --> 08:16.034
I mean, some jag is obviously
jealous of your rising star.

08:16.068 --> 08:18.169
But the fact is,
until this is settled,

08:18.203 --> 08:20.638
the bar isn't gonna
let you practice.

08:23.209 --> 08:25.143
So you got caught
in your own lie?

08:25.177 --> 08:26.845
I almost lost my family.

08:26.879 --> 08:28.897
How does your little tragedy
even compare?

08:28.931 --> 08:30.548
Because I had to go
to school here.

08:30.583 --> 08:31.800
Abed, do not write that down.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.068
It's not like
I made Andre cheat.

08:34.102 --> 08:36.638
Well, I happen to think it's
cool that we're all connected,

08:36.672 --> 08:38.256
even if some of it's
in bad ways.

08:38.289 --> 08:39.941
I mean, I'm finally willing
to forgive Annie

08:39.975 --> 08:41.409
for ruining high school.

08:41.443 --> 08:43.678
Wait, I ruined <i>your</i> time
in high school?

08:43.712 --> 08:46.047
Yeah, you did.

08:47.817 --> 08:49.751
- You guys doing keg stands?
- Yeah!

08:49.785 --> 08:51.970
Anyone can do a keg stand.

08:52.004 --> 08:53.271
I'm gonna do a keg flip.

08:53.305 --> 08:55.173
Hey, everybody, look at this.

08:59.845 --> 09:01.229
Ah!

09:01.263 --> 09:03.131
Oh!

09:03.165 --> 09:05.183
Oh, my football knee!
Why!

09:05.217 --> 09:06.184
Can I have some corn nuts?

09:06.202 --> 09:09.804
Wah!
No! Nooooo!

09:12.091 --> 09:13.525
That had nothing to do with me.

09:13.559 --> 09:15.443
And you already admitted
that you faked that injury

09:15.478 --> 09:16.845
because you couldn't
take the pressure

09:16.896 --> 09:18.196
of those football recruiters.

09:18.230 --> 09:20.548
I faked my injury
because of what you said to me.

09:20.583 --> 09:21.966
Because of what I said?

09:22.001 --> 09:24.202
You didn't even remember
that I went to school with you.

09:24.203 --> 09:26.654
I may have lied about that too.

09:29.508 --> 09:32.510
Hey, guys, it's time to do
senior class superlatives!

09:34.997 --> 09:38.266
Okay, the first award
is "Most Handsome."

09:38.300 --> 09:39.968
And the winner is...

09:40.002 --> 09:43.137
- Troy Barnes.
- Of course it is.

09:43.172 --> 09:44.389
"Most Popular."

09:44.423 --> 09:46.357
Troy Barnes.

09:46.391 --> 09:48.810
No! You guys are awesome.

09:48.844 --> 09:49.911
"Best Smile."

09:51.029 --> 09:52.614
Ha ha, gotta keep 'em white.

09:52.648 --> 09:56.518
"Best Moves."
"Best Practical Joker."

09:56.569 --> 09:58.036
"Coolest Locker."

09:58.070 --> 10:00.054
And now, the last award
of the night.

10:00.089 --> 10:02.557
"Most Likely to Succeed."

10:02.608 --> 10:04.175
Okay, this has to go to me,

10:04.193 --> 10:05.810
because I am most likely
to succeed.

10:05.845 --> 10:07.478
It's just a fact.
You guys know.

10:07.496 --> 10:10.048
And the winner is...

10:10.082 --> 10:11.266
Troy Barnes.

10:16.088 --> 10:17.839
You have got to be kidding me!

10:17.890 --> 10:21.442
Troy Barnes,
most likely to succeed?

10:21.477 --> 10:24.929
I'm the damn Valedictorian
and head of student council

10:24.964 --> 10:27.715
and president of campus
crusade for Christ.

10:27.750 --> 10:28.866
And I'm Jewish!

10:28.884 --> 10:32.086
And you are just
some mindless robot.

10:32.121 --> 10:34.622
You just go wherever
they tell you to run.

10:34.657 --> 10:37.675
I'm sorry.

10:37.710 --> 10:39.794
Do you go to my school?

10:39.828 --> 10:42.747
Oh!

10:49.221 --> 10:51.556
Pop! Pop!

10:52.775 --> 10:54.175
Your words cut me

10:54.209 --> 10:56.761
more than hundreds of
non-tempered glass shards could.

10:56.779 --> 11:00.281
I had six different
reconstructive surgeries.

11:00.316 --> 11:01.766
I went through withdrawal.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.003
I had to smile
when I didn't feel like smiling.

11:05.037 --> 11:06.387
That hurts my face.

11:06.422 --> 11:08.222
Can we all just stop
dredging up the past?

11:08.257 --> 11:10.007
The only thing
your fate web thing does

11:10.025 --> 11:12.794
is point out how fragile
our happiness is.

11:12.828 --> 11:15.330
If only Jeff hadn't defended
that woman,

11:15.381 --> 11:17.181
if only Andre hadn't met her
after I left the restaurant,

11:17.216 --> 11:19.033
if only I didn't have to pick up
my kids at the mall, I--

11:19.068 --> 11:20.301
Wait.

11:20.336 --> 11:23.087
When? Which mall?

11:24.573 --> 11:26.674
Oh, my God.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.626
Oh, my God.

11:32.164 --> 11:33.531
Hey, what movie
you guys gonna see?

11:33.565 --> 11:35.900
<i>The Phantom Menace.</i>
<i>It's kind of old.</i>

11:35.918 --> 11:37.352
And why
do you wanna see it?

11:37.386 --> 11:38.720
Because we like <i>Star Wars.</i>

11:38.771 --> 11:40.138
Okay, if you like <i>Star Wars,</i>

11:40.172 --> 11:41.673
why do you wanna murder it
and urinate on its grave?

11:41.707 --> 11:42.907
The prequels are terrible.

11:42.941 --> 11:44.242
I mean, seriously,
wouldn't Chewbacca,

11:44.276 --> 11:46.244
at some point, go,
"Hey, Yoda, I know that guy"?

11:46.278 --> 11:48.045
He has double light sabers.

11:48.063 --> 11:49.564
That's stupid.
You're both stupid.

11:49.598 --> 11:51.666
Well, why are you here
to see the movie?

11:51.700 --> 11:52.917
I'm not.

11:52.951 --> 11:54.752
I go wherever it plays
to warn people.

11:54.787 --> 11:56.104
You've been warned.

11:59.524 --> 12:02.293
Stranger said what to him?

12:02.327 --> 12:04.862
Okay, fine.
I'll come get you.

12:04.897 --> 12:07.148
I'm sorry, baby,
I'll be back as soon as I can.

12:07.199 --> 12:09.951
Okay, just stand there, okay?

12:09.985 --> 12:12.253
This can't be.

12:12.287 --> 12:14.422
I don't see why
I have to go to a therapist.

12:14.473 --> 12:16.507
Because after that woman
chewed them out for three hours,

12:16.541 --> 12:19.060
the theater got
a restraining order against you.

12:19.094 --> 12:20.662
<i>Yalla.</i>

12:22.881 --> 12:24.048
Hey, doc.
By the way,

12:24.083 --> 12:26.083
someone just stole
your prescription pad.

12:28.537 --> 12:29.887
I'm trying to liberate you!

12:29.922 --> 12:31.622
Ow!

12:33.726 --> 12:35.610
You're the crazy man
at the mall!

12:35.644 --> 12:37.712
You're the one who got me
busted for drugs!

12:37.746 --> 12:40.682
You were out there somewhere
and you weren't looking for me?

12:40.733 --> 12:42.650
In fairness, Annie,

12:42.701 --> 12:45.061
running through a glass door
might've been the drug tip-off.

12:45.070 --> 12:46.304
All this time,
I wondered what it was

12:46.338 --> 12:48.639
that brought our group
together.

12:48.674 --> 12:50.308
But I forgot one thing
all heroes need.

12:50.342 --> 12:51.576
They need an enemy.

12:51.610 --> 12:52.744
Batman has the Joker,

12:52.778 --> 12:54.512
the Justice League
has the Legion of Doom,

12:54.546 --> 12:57.532
and this study group...
has me.

12:57.566 --> 12:59.950
I'm the supervillain.
Why didn't I see it before?

12:59.968 --> 13:01.986
I'm emotionless, logical,
smarter than everybody else.

13:02.021 --> 13:03.855
- Hey!
- I tried sawing off

13:03.889 --> 13:05.406
- Jeff's arm.
- Why do you keep saying that?

13:05.457 --> 13:07.008
I should go.
It's not safe to be around me.

13:07.042 --> 13:08.259
I'm just as bad.

13:08.293 --> 13:09.761
I couldn't handle the monkey,

13:09.795 --> 13:11.779
so I traded it in
for a glaucoma brownie,

13:11.814 --> 13:13.915
even though I knew
if it bit someone,

13:13.949 --> 13:16.117
it would make them
a teensy bit psychotic.

13:16.168 --> 13:18.186
Britta's right.

13:18.220 --> 13:19.937
We've all made
some bad decisions.

13:19.972 --> 13:22.156
And if you really wanna know
who the villain is here,

13:22.191 --> 13:24.258
it's me.

13:26.729 --> 13:28.879
- Ah.
- Weee!

13:28.897 --> 13:30.448
Yeesh, I didn't think
it was possible

13:30.482 --> 13:31.833
to put more glitter on.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.201
It's coming off of you
like Pig-Pen.

13:33.252 --> 13:35.720
Well, some people
seem to like it.

13:35.754 --> 13:38.072
This married guy just gave me
his phone number.

13:38.123 --> 13:39.574
Can you believe
his wife left him

13:39.625 --> 13:40.908
on their anniversary?

13:40.959 --> 13:42.226
You gonna call him?

13:42.261 --> 13:43.394
I mean, he did just win
a bunch of money.

13:43.429 --> 13:44.695
I don't know though.

13:44.730 --> 13:46.291
You don't know what?
You're not married.

13:46.331 --> 13:48.166
You gotta grab what you want
in this life.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.034
That's the way it works.

13:50.052 --> 13:52.220
Someone just took
something important from me.

13:52.271 --> 13:53.788
And you know what?

13:53.822 --> 13:55.773
I admire him for it.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.825
All right, I mean,
I guess I'll go talk to him.

13:57.876 --> 13:59.060
You do that.

13:59.094 --> 14:00.228
And I'm gonna go get

14:00.262 --> 14:01.946
"crap on other people's lawns"
drunk.

14:01.980 --> 14:05.099
To a memorable evening
for both of us.

14:08.087 --> 14:10.271
Maybe you coincidentally
affected some of us.

14:10.305 --> 14:13.257
But I actively endorsed pain.

14:13.275 --> 14:15.643
I was the bad guy, and...

14:15.677 --> 14:19.247
I'd like to think
I'm not that guy anymore.

14:19.281 --> 14:21.999
Also, and I hate
to bring this up,

14:22.034 --> 14:23.918
you did once make me
pee myself.

14:23.952 --> 14:27.404
Well, I guess we're even then.

14:27.422 --> 14:29.373
I might finish studying
at home.

14:37.599 --> 14:38.983
Just ten minutes ago,

14:39.017 --> 14:41.919
I would've been so excited
about that peeing thing.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:54.387 --> 14:57.164
I wanted to make a prequel
and I ruined everything.

14:58.169 --> 14:59.586
I guess it could happen to anyone.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.854
I should probably write
George Lucas a note of apology.

15:01.889 --> 15:04.107
Okay, let's not get crazy.

15:04.141 --> 15:06.392
And you didn't ruin anything.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.695
May I sit here?

15:08.729 --> 15:10.496
Shirley,
what are you doing here?

15:10.531 --> 15:13.683
Oh, just wanted some yogurt.

15:13.717 --> 15:16.703
And I do know
you're not that person anymore.

15:16.737 --> 15:19.105
Are you sure?
'Cause I was awfully good at it.

15:19.139 --> 15:21.074
Well, we all do bad things
every now and again.

15:21.108 --> 15:23.126
I mean, I put a stripper's head
through a jukebox.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.260
Hmm.

15:24.294 --> 15:26.796
What are you guys doing here?

15:29.133 --> 15:31.267
I guess we all
really wanted yogurt.

15:31.301 --> 15:33.135
You know what's weird?

15:33.153 --> 15:35.304
This is where I first decided
to go to Greendale.

15:35.339 --> 15:37.540
Wait, really?

15:37.558 --> 15:40.660
This is where I was when I first
decided to go to Greendale.

15:40.694 --> 15:43.880
You're kidding me.

15:43.914 --> 15:46.215
Senor Chang, I know you're
as disappointed as I am

15:46.249 --> 15:48.468
in the caliber of students
we have at Greendale.

15:48.519 --> 15:52.038
But the mall offers a whole new
valuable demographic

15:52.072 --> 15:54.073
of people awake
during the daytime.

15:54.124 --> 15:55.958
All right, I'll pass flyers
at Yogurtsburgh.

15:55.992 --> 15:57.326
Self-serve yogurt.

15:57.344 --> 15:59.429
Those douses already know
one marketable skill.

15:59.463 --> 16:00.813
Okay, Ben--

16:00.864 --> 16:02.315
But it still has the tags on!

16:02.366 --> 16:04.283
So I lost the receipt.

16:04.334 --> 16:05.685
It's not like I even got
to wear it,

16:05.719 --> 16:08.221
because my husband's
a tasteless man slut.

16:08.272 --> 16:11.791
What hey, littering!

16:16.413 --> 16:18.481
This better not
awaken anything in me.

16:26.590 --> 16:28.191
God, this day...

16:28.225 --> 16:29.759
I thought pushing that woman's
head through a jukebox

16:29.827 --> 16:31.527
would make me feel better,
but I'm just...

16:31.529 --> 16:33.546
out of $54...

16:33.597 --> 16:34.831
and a marriage.

16:34.865 --> 16:37.066
<i>Crystal Skull</i> was aliens,

16:37.101 --> 16:38.951
so it's a pretty great film.

16:45.075 --> 16:46.576
You guys seen this?

16:46.610 --> 16:50.313
Guys, working the program
with you has been so great.

16:50.347 --> 16:54.917
I feel like I'm finally ready
to get my life back on track.

16:54.951 --> 16:56.085
Last chance.

16:56.103 --> 16:57.603
Just walk over there right now

16:57.638 --> 16:59.405
and apologize
to the theater manager.

16:59.456 --> 17:02.175
Midichlorians.

17:02.209 --> 17:03.493
Midichlorians!

17:03.527 --> 17:04.644
Fine.

17:04.694 --> 17:06.529
Then you're not going
to film school!

17:08.397 --> 17:10.800
Hi!
Do you have any vegan froyo?

17:10.834 --> 17:12.652
Do you even know what froyo is?

17:12.685 --> 17:15.121
Fine. Do you have
a job application?

17:15.155 --> 17:16.521
Hey.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.175
That weird guy
hasn't blinked once.

17:19.193 --> 17:22.111
Oh, yeah.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.246
What a dweeb.

17:24.263 --> 17:25.448
Yeah, what a dweeb.

17:25.482 --> 17:28.050
Oh, nice shot, man!

17:30.454 --> 17:31.821
Hey, do you work at Greendale?

17:31.855 --> 17:33.406
Work? That's putting it
charitably.

17:33.457 --> 17:35.624
Greendale community college
is a total joke.

17:35.642 --> 17:38.361
They'd give a degree
to a monkey.

17:38.395 --> 17:42.532
Hey, does Ian Duncan still
teach psychology at Greendale?

17:42.566 --> 17:44.016
- That drunken limey?
- That's the one.

17:44.051 --> 17:45.485
He's got tenure.

17:45.519 --> 17:47.639
Maybe getting my degree
won't be as hard as I thought.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.275
Sir, what are you doing?

17:52.309 --> 17:54.143
Can we get some help out here?

17:54.161 --> 17:56.521
Some old guy broke the machine
and is faking a heart attack.

18:00.601 --> 18:01.868
Oh, wait.

18:01.902 --> 18:03.736
Ah, stupid.

18:13.297 --> 18:14.764
Cool, cool, cool.

18:14.798 --> 18:17.583
Wait, so was that old guy
really Pierce?

18:17.618 --> 18:20.369
We'll never know, because
he'll never ever remember.

18:20.387 --> 18:22.388
What are the chances
of all of us

18:22.439 --> 18:25.474
ending up at the same place
at the same time twice?

18:25.492 --> 18:26.792
Abed, it's amazing.

18:26.827 --> 18:28.294
I mean, yes,
2008 was the height

18:28.345 --> 18:30.947
of the slightly sour
frozen yogurt craze, but...

18:30.981 --> 18:32.848
that still doesn't explain it.

18:32.866 --> 18:35.451
Maybe we really were
all meant to be together.

18:35.485 --> 18:40.289
I'm not sure I understand it,
but maybe we don't have to.

18:40.324 --> 18:43.292
What I do know is that
the ways our paths crossed,

18:43.327 --> 18:47.830
even when they were bad,
all led us to this point.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.383
And I wouldn't have it
any other way.

18:50.417 --> 18:51.918
So what you're saying

18:51.952 --> 18:53.535
is that we're all each other's
Uncle Ben's murder.

18:53.554 --> 18:55.555
And we're all Spider-Men.

18:55.606 --> 18:57.607
Yeah.

18:57.641 --> 18:58.941
Let's say I'm saying that.

18:58.976 --> 19:02.128
Mm, I think we know
whose will this really is.

19:02.179 --> 19:04.764
Yeah, I think I do.

19:04.815 --> 19:06.232
I'll be right back.

19:11.572 --> 19:13.673
Hello?

19:15.458 --> 19:18.444
Hey, Abed.

19:18.478 --> 19:21.264
Just doing
some Pilates.

19:21.298 --> 19:23.003
- I was looking for you.
- Wha--I--

19:23.123 --> 19:25.952
We discovered you're the
reason we all went to Greendale.

19:25.986 --> 19:27.603
You linked all of our stories.

19:27.638 --> 19:29.518
Like how the Cosmic Cube
assembled the Avengers.

19:29.541 --> 19:31.739
That, and the 4-billion-dollar
deal with Disney.

19:31.859 --> 19:34.310
Turns out
you were always one of us.

19:34.344 --> 19:37.546
So I came to see if you wanted
to get some frozen yogurt.

19:37.581 --> 19:39.192
Really?

19:39.438 --> 19:42.078
That's--

19:42.198 --> 19:45.732
that's all I ever wanted.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.545
But it's too late.

19:47.982 --> 19:49.537
Here's another thing
I realized.

19:49.837 --> 19:52.761
Because of you we got to
reinvent ourselves at Greendale.

19:52.881 --> 19:55.181
Everyone should have the
same chance, don't you think...

19:55.215 --> 19:57.216
- Chang?
- It's not Chang.

19:57.267 --> 20:01.070
It's Kevin.

20:01.104 --> 20:03.639
How long have you known?

20:03.674 --> 20:05.083
Known what?

20:05.356 --> 20:08.544
Only you know
who you really are.

20:08.578 --> 20:11.397
Also, you may have
experimental monkey fever.

20:11.448 --> 20:13.032
You coming?

20:16.820 --> 20:18.533
Yeah.

20:22.779 --> 20:24.497
Actually, can we stop
at the post office first?

20:24.531 --> 20:25.948
I have something to mail
for the Dean.

20:25.999 --> 20:27.733
It's confidential
and I don't wanna talk about it,

20:27.751 --> 20:29.252
so stop interrogating me.

20:32.780 --> 20:33.911
I'm out.

20:34.151 --> 20:37.804
You're too in to be out.

20:41.066 --> 20:42.567
- Hey!
- Hi!

20:42.601 --> 20:44.485
You want some refills?
On me, huh?

20:44.519 --> 20:45.820
Refills?
You want some?

20:45.940 --> 20:46.870
_

20:46.990 --> 20:48.125
_

20:49.067 --> 20:51.140
Time for plan "B".
