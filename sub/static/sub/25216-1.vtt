02:18.498 --> 02:19.898
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Fuck!

02:19.900 --> 02:21.133
Ooh.

02:21.135 --> 02:22.934
Shit!

02:22.936 --> 02:25.073
Jesus.

02:27.541 --> 02:29.374
I'm so sorry.
That's yours.

02:29.376 --> 02:30.709
Thank you.

02:30.711 --> 02:32.880
- Um, we'll... just...
- Yep.

02:35.282 --> 02:37.917
- Sorry about that.
- No, it's...

02:37.919 --> 02:39.317
Um, there's... there's...

02:39.319 --> 02:41.054
I can find a phone store
or something

02:41.056 --> 02:42.721
and you can get the screen
replaced and...

02:42.723 --> 02:44.456
It's not turning on.

02:44.458 --> 02:45.958
Um...

02:45.960 --> 02:47.660
There's... there's bound
to be something down here.

03:02.178 --> 03:04.279
Jesus.

03:13.221 --> 03:14.888
It's very badly damaged.

03:14.890 --> 03:18.057
- Yep.
- I can't fix it today.

03:18.059 --> 03:19.559
You can't have it fixed
by today?

03:19.561 --> 03:21.060
I can't fix it today.

03:21.062 --> 03:24.499
Um... well, I'm flying out of
the country tomorrow, so I...

03:26.334 --> 03:28.236
..I definitely need it fixed
by today.

03:35.243 --> 03:36.677
Eight o'clock tomorrow.

03:36.679 --> 03:38.178
Eight o'clock
in the morning tomorrow?

03:38.180 --> 03:40.447
Right, so, if I come by at
eight o'clock in the morning,

03:40.449 --> 03:41.782
it will definitely be fixed?

03:41.784 --> 03:43.085
Eight o'clock.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.652
Alright.

03:45.654 --> 03:47.556
OK. Thank you.

03:48.924 --> 03:52.160
Um, do you need to call anyone,
anything...?

03:52.162 --> 03:53.562
Um...

03:54.964 --> 03:56.864
Actually, I would love to
call my fiancé quickly.

03:56.866 --> 03:58.198
- Do you mind if I...?
- Sure. Please.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.000
- It's an international call.
- That's fine.

04:00.002 --> 04:01.737
- OK. Thank you so much.
- It's OK.

04:04.674 --> 04:07.174
Hi. It's me.
Um, I've broken my phone.

04:07.176 --> 04:09.376
Everything's fine.
Uh, I'm all set for tomorrow.

04:09.378 --> 04:11.478
But just send me an email
if there's any problems.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.216
OK. Love you. Bye.

04:14.618 --> 04:15.984
Thank you.

04:15.986 --> 04:17.519
Do you need to use my phone
for anything else?

04:17.521 --> 04:19.220
No, I'm just gonna go find an
internet cafe. I've got to...

04:19.221 --> 04:21.089
Oh, please, you can sit down
in a cafe,

04:21.091 --> 04:22.724
use my phone for
whatever you have to do.

04:22.726 --> 04:24.526
- Uh... OK, yeah, that'd be...
- Yeah?

04:24.528 --> 04:26.596
- That'd be good. Thank you.
- I'm so sorry about all this.

04:33.804 --> 04:36.971
Yeah. I just... had to...

04:36.973 --> 04:40.176
..rebook a connecting flight,
and it's gone through.

04:40.178 --> 04:42.043
- Thank you very much.
- That's OK.

04:42.045 --> 04:43.780
- Thank you.
- That's OK.

04:55.559 --> 04:58.762
Have you, um... got anything
else planned today, or...?

05:00.564 --> 05:02.665
No, I was just sort of...

05:02.667 --> 05:04.099
..um...

05:04.101 --> 05:05.934
..pottering around town.

05:05.936 --> 05:07.635
I've got to get
this flight tomorrow, so...

05:07.637 --> 05:09.370
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to London.

05:09.372 --> 05:11.472
I live in London. Yeah.

05:11.474 --> 05:12.842
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:12.844 --> 05:14.810
- Going home.
- Wow.

05:14.812 --> 05:16.047
Yeah.

05:18.316 --> 05:19.815
Have you been working?

05:19.817 --> 05:23.719
Um, no, I've kind of finished
all my stuff for the day.

05:23.721 --> 05:25.290
But, um...

05:26.657 --> 05:29.092
Yeah, I was gonna
go down to... to Bondi,

05:29.094 --> 05:30.895
see the Sculpture by the Sea.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.504
If you don't have anything on,

05:42.506 --> 05:44.142
you'd be more than
welcome to...

05:45.244 --> 05:46.879
..come down or something.

05:51.483 --> 05:53.118
Um...

05:54.852 --> 05:56.454
Whereabouts is it?

06:06.731 --> 06:08.565
I don't actually know
your name.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.533
- Oh. I'm Viv.
- I'm Jasper.

06:10.535 --> 06:12.305
- Jasper. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.940
I was actually gonna go down
and see it on Monday,

06:15.942 --> 06:17.442
but it was raining.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.742
Excuse me? Sorry.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.878
Um, do you know where
Sculpture by the Sea is?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.246
Um, I think it's down there.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.747
- OK...
- Just down that road.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.584
- OK, cool. Thank you.
- See you later. Bye-bye.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.643
Excuse me? Hey.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.879
Is this... the Sculptures
by the Sea?

07:27.881 --> 07:30.614
Yeah. You missed it.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.050
- Oh.
- Is this all wrapping up now?

07:32.052 --> 07:33.484
- Is this all done?
- Yeah, it's all finished.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.087
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

07:37.425 --> 07:40.093
- 100 sculptures, you missed.
- Right.

07:40.095 --> 07:42.694
120. Something like this.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.972
Thank you.

08:04.487 --> 08:06.120
I feel like an idiot.

08:27.642 --> 08:29.410
I was really expecting
this whole thing

08:29.412 --> 08:31.444
to be littered with sculptures.

08:31.446 --> 08:33.548
- That's fine.
- I'm sorry about that.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.817
I'd love to see a whale.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.422
A whale?

08:42.424 --> 08:43.923
I'd like to see a seahorse.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.725
- I've seen a seahorse.
- You've seen a seahorse?

08:45.727 --> 08:47.061
They're strange.

08:47.063 --> 08:48.661
Yeah, I was snorkelling once
and I found one.

08:48.663 --> 08:50.766
And then I went and got
a plastic bag and...

08:52.168 --> 08:53.900
..I went and put
the seahorse in a plastic bag

08:53.902 --> 08:55.302
to show my family.

08:55.304 --> 08:56.702
But then I took it back.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.505
Oh, right. I thought you were
gonna say, "It died."

08:58.507 --> 08:59.542
No.

09:03.979 --> 09:05.845
I keep going
to check my phone.

09:05.847 --> 09:07.747
Sorry.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.151
What were you doing?

09:10.554 --> 09:14.088
I was... engaged in a social
media battle.

09:14.090 --> 09:16.825
Are you serious?
About what?

09:16.827 --> 09:19.359
This radio host said

09:19.361 --> 09:21.730
this politician
should go and hang himself.

09:24.501 --> 09:26.134
Really fired you up, did it?

09:26.136 --> 09:27.904
Yeah.

09:32.141 --> 09:34.109
I-I knew someone
who hanged themselves.

09:34.111 --> 09:35.609
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

09:35.611 --> 09:37.848
No, it's fine.
It happened a long time ago.

09:41.451 --> 09:43.016
It was my girlfriend
at the time.

09:43.018 --> 09:45.522
- Oh, Jesus. I'm so sorry.
- No, it's fine. Honestly.

09:48.825 --> 09:50.526
So, did you... win the battle?

09:50.528 --> 09:52.128
I don't know.
I bumped into someone.

10:01.771 --> 10:03.074
Whoa.

10:17.721 --> 10:19.490
Want to keep walking?

10:21.259 --> 10:22.692
Cool.

10:27.131 --> 10:28.933
Oh!
These shoes are not ideal.

10:33.538 --> 10:35.171
I think the bus stop's
over there.

10:35.173 --> 10:36.908
OK.

10:48.019 --> 10:50.886
You see a lot of names that
aren't really used anymore,

10:50.888 --> 10:52.656
like... Edith.

10:52.658 --> 10:54.892
- It's an old name.
- 1869.

11:07.539 --> 11:09.006
Oh!

11:11.143 --> 11:12.911
It's Henry Lawson down here.

11:14.913 --> 11:17.547
Here we go.

11:17.549 --> 11:20.650
"Love hangs about thy
name like music round a shell

11:20.652 --> 11:22.888
"No heart can take of thee
a tame farewell."

11:25.692 --> 11:27.260
I love him.

11:36.134 --> 11:37.901
I wonder if there's
a certain time of year

11:37.903 --> 11:39.172
when more people die.

11:40.540 --> 11:41.907
Winter, I guess.

11:53.986 --> 11:56.320
Hey, buddy! Hey.

11:56.322 --> 11:58.189
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

11:58.191 --> 12:00.424
Yeah. He was just
sitting here. Hey.

12:00.426 --> 12:02.093
- Where did you come from?
- Hello!

12:02.095 --> 12:04.195
- Was he just here?
- Yeah. I...

12:04.197 --> 12:07.166
You want to hold that for
a sec? I'll see if there's...

12:08.368 --> 12:10.034
He was just lying there.

12:11.371 --> 12:12.972
- Hey.
- Hello?

12:14.708 --> 12:16.141
He can't have...

12:16.143 --> 12:17.942
Well, OK. Let's go.

12:17.944 --> 12:19.410
Which way?

12:19.412 --> 12:20.945
- Where did you come from?
- Show us the way, mate.

12:20.947 --> 12:22.414
Show us the way.
Show us the way.

12:22.416 --> 12:23.981
Was he tied up
or was he just lying there?

12:23.983 --> 12:25.450
He was just lying there.

12:25.452 --> 12:27.252
I just think
there might be a gate open

12:27.254 --> 12:29.056
that he's run out of.

12:39.867 --> 12:41.368
Oh, my God.

12:51.513 --> 12:52.944
Let me just see
if he has a tag.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.346
- Oh, yeah.
- One sec.

12:54.348 --> 12:56.715
Hold on, mate. Where are we?

12:56.717 --> 12:58.884
- Ah. We're in luck.
- Oh, good.

12:58.886 --> 13:01.287
- Huh! Cézanne.
- Cézanne!

13:01.289 --> 13:03.623
- Cézanne. That's perfect.
- Ohh!

13:03.625 --> 13:05.024
Cézanne.

13:05.026 --> 13:06.224
Hello.

13:06.226 --> 13:10.262
Um, we've found Cézanne
on the street.

13:10.264 --> 13:12.130
No, no. He's...
No, he's OK. He's OK.

13:12.132 --> 13:13.466
Yeah, no, he's...

13:13.468 --> 13:15.268
Is there somewhere
that we can drop him off or...?

13:18.005 --> 13:19.905
The city.
Can we get a cab to the city?

13:19.907 --> 13:21.374
- He's in the city? Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:21.376 --> 13:24.410
Um... yeah. Yeah,
that... that should be fine.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.512
In you go.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.015
- Come on, mate. Up you get.
- Come on. Good boy.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.550
Good boy. There we go.

13:30.552 --> 13:32.051
- There we go. Oh, my God!
- Well done!

13:32.053 --> 13:33.252
- Ooh, you got my...
- Good boy.

13:33.254 --> 13:34.654
- Good boy.
- Hey.

13:34.656 --> 13:36.089
Ugh.

13:40.296 --> 13:42.063
Dog hair everywhere.

15:27.138 --> 15:28.504
Come on.

15:28.506 --> 15:30.842
Whoa! Whoa... whoa!

15:32.108 --> 15:33.809
Come on, then. Come on, buddy!

15:33.811 --> 15:35.277
That's it.

15:35.279 --> 15:37.079
Thank you.

15:37.081 --> 15:38.514
Thank you.

15:38.516 --> 15:40.117
Come on. Up here.

15:42.219 --> 15:43.786
Hello, Cézanne!

15:43.788 --> 15:45.287
There we go!

15:45.289 --> 15:47.289
Thank you. Let's go.
Follow me, yeah?

15:47.291 --> 15:48.657
OK.

15:48.659 --> 15:51.260
- After you.
- Thank you.

15:51.262 --> 15:53.662
You silly boy,
you silly boy, Cézanne!

15:53.664 --> 15:55.498
- Beautiful dog.
- You don't like me anymore?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.066
You don't want to stay with me?

15:57.068 --> 15:58.768
- Thank you very much, yeah?
- No worries.

15:58.770 --> 16:02.071
Must have left the gate open
and he... he run away.

16:02.073 --> 16:04.174
Did you find new friends?

16:04.176 --> 16:05.942
Do you want to eat
something in here, guys?

16:05.944 --> 16:07.209
Do you want a table?

16:07.211 --> 16:08.577
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Sure.

16:08.579 --> 16:09.980
- Yeah, that'd be great!
- Follow me, yeah?

16:09.982 --> 16:11.615
- Thank you very much.
- Follow me. Let's go.

16:11.617 --> 16:13.117
Thank you!

16:14.219 --> 16:15.821
Ah.

16:17.856 --> 16:20.457
Order anything you want.
I will pay for you. OK?

16:20.459 --> 16:22.157
- Oh. Thank you!
- Oh, that's so kind of you!

16:22.159 --> 16:23.493
- Thank you very much.
- Are you sure?

16:23.495 --> 16:25.095
Anything. Whatever you like.
Feel free, OK?

16:25.097 --> 16:27.531
- Oh, brilliant. Thank you.
- Thank you so much!

16:27.533 --> 16:30.099
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

17:39.940 --> 17:41.541
Ah.

17:45.111 --> 17:46.480
Oh.

17:56.155 --> 17:57.925
OK.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.100
So, how long have you
been engaged for?

18:41.102 --> 18:43.903
I have been engaged
for a year and a half.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.138
Mm-hm.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.305
We were meant to get
married last year,

18:46.307 --> 18:47.840
but we had to postpone
the wedding.

18:47.842 --> 18:49.676
So, it'll be some time
this year.

18:49.678 --> 18:52.680
- Mm.
- What about you? A girlfriend?

18:52.682 --> 18:54.916
Oh, I was seeing
someone, but...

18:56.618 --> 18:58.518
..I just wasn't
in the right head space.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.822
Mm-hm.

19:01.322 --> 19:04.525
Did you know that Da Vinci
was a staunch vegetarian?

19:04.527 --> 19:06.093
- Really? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

19:06.095 --> 19:08.695
He'd buy caged birds
and set them free.

19:08.697 --> 19:12.900
And Picasso had
a pet monkey, a pet goat,

19:12.902 --> 19:16.904
a turtle and a whole pack
of dogs and cats as pets.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.872
And Roman statues, when
they were originally built...

19:18.874 --> 19:20.741
- Oh, my God.
- Right? Get this.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.310
The heads were detachable
so they could replace them.

19:23.312 --> 19:24.945
Why have you got
those little facts?

19:24.947 --> 19:26.547
Like a little... a fact guy?

19:26.549 --> 19:28.149
That's how I spend
my down time.

19:28.151 --> 19:30.117
Just arty... arty animal facts?

19:30.119 --> 19:31.752
- How was it? Good?
- So beautiful, yeah.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.220
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

19:33.222 --> 19:34.555
Delicious.

19:34.557 --> 19:36.024
I keep saying how beautiful
everything is.

19:36.026 --> 19:37.624
It feels disingenuous,
doesn't it?

19:37.626 --> 19:39.661
- "Beautiful. Just beautiful."
- "Just beautiful."

19:39.663 --> 19:42.429
Is there anything that you're
really, really scared of?

19:42.431 --> 19:43.866
Um...

19:44.900 --> 19:47.269
Spiders. Heights.

19:48.638 --> 19:50.505
Don't like planes.

19:50.507 --> 19:52.073
Really?

19:52.075 --> 19:54.441
I always see a plane
and I'm, like, gobsmacked.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.343
When I see it going through
the air, I'm like...

19:56.345 --> 19:58.113
It's true. It's pretty weird
to look up and think...

19:58.115 --> 19:59.714
You know I've never
been overseas?

19:59.716 --> 20:01.149
- You've never been overseas?
- Yeah.

20:01.151 --> 20:02.784
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.619
- Really? Never?
- Yeah. Never.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.553
- Wow.
- No, I've never been overseas.

20:06.555 --> 20:07.922
How old are you?

20:07.924 --> 20:09.190
27.

20:09.192 --> 20:10.925
- Never been?
- Yeah.

20:10.927 --> 20:13.561
What are you afraid of?

20:13.563 --> 20:15.463
I'm, like... I'm afraid of,
like, swimming.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.865
Oh, really?
You don't like swimming?

20:16.867 --> 20:18.600
I don't like swimming. No.

20:18.602 --> 20:20.904
Who ARE you?

20:22.873 --> 20:24.739
Have you got siblings?

20:24.741 --> 20:26.142
- No.
- Hmm.

20:26.144 --> 20:27.877
What about you?
Do you have any siblings?

20:27.879 --> 20:29.577
Yeah, I've got
a younger sister.

20:29.579 --> 20:31.379
Yeah, she's two years
younger than me.

20:31.381 --> 20:34.116
- Are you guys close?
- Yeah, we are. Yeah.

20:34.118 --> 20:35.416
I mean, we have, like, the...

20:35.418 --> 20:37.486
..you know, sibling stuff
that's tricky,

20:37.488 --> 20:39.455
but we're pretty close.

20:39.457 --> 20:41.523
I remember when she was born.

20:41.525 --> 20:44.860
I remember just this intense
jealousy and hatred,

20:44.862 --> 20:46.262
going to the hospital.

20:46.264 --> 20:47.863
- That's horrible.
- That's my earliest memory.

20:47.865 --> 20:49.298
I always think it's strange

20:49.300 --> 20:51.234
when people say, "Oh, I have
a brother or sister,"

20:51.236 --> 20:53.002
and they're like,
"And I hate them,"

20:53.004 --> 20:55.037
or, "They're so annoying,"
or, "We just don't talk."

20:55.039 --> 20:56.437
I think that's a real shame.

20:56.439 --> 20:57.807
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:57.809 --> 20:59.710
What about school?
What were you like at school?

21:00.878 --> 21:02.478
- I was pretty naughty.
- Were you?

21:02.480 --> 21:04.547
Yeah. I was a real naughty...

21:04.549 --> 21:07.483
I also stabbed the kid with a
pencil once. I don't know why.

21:07.485 --> 21:08.617
What do you mean?

21:08.619 --> 21:10.352
Like, we were just playing,

21:10.354 --> 21:13.156
and, um, I stabbed him,
and the lead broke off.

21:13.158 --> 21:15.926
He had two days off
and got lead poisoning

21:15.928 --> 21:18.329
'cause I got it in his vein
and it snapped off.

21:19.664 --> 21:22.866
God. I thought pencils
were made of graphite.

21:22.868 --> 21:24.466
Well, this was back in the day.

21:28.873 --> 21:30.307
Do you know what time it is?

21:30.309 --> 21:31.743
Um...

21:33.344 --> 21:34.878
It's about 9:30.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.513
Do you mind if I borrow
your phone quickly?

21:36.515 --> 21:37.747
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

21:37.749 --> 21:39.083
Thank you so much.
I'll be one sec.

21:39.085 --> 21:40.686
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

21:59.072 --> 22:01.138
Hi. It's me. Um...

22:01.140 --> 22:03.241
I'm gonna be on this number
if you want to try and call me.

22:03.243 --> 22:04.875
Um...

22:04.877 --> 22:08.079
Everything's fine.
I hope... you're OK.

22:08.081 --> 22:09.881
Um...

22:09.883 --> 22:12.585
OK. Love you. Bye.

22:18.992 --> 22:20.457
- Thank you.
- You OK?

22:20.459 --> 22:21.861
Yeah.

22:26.699 --> 22:28.066
Want to play a game?

22:28.068 --> 22:30.001
- What?
- You want to play a game?

22:30.003 --> 22:31.903
- Alright.
- Alright. OK.

22:31.905 --> 22:33.338
You have to be, like, here.

22:33.340 --> 22:35.006
The first thing that comes
to your mind, OK?

22:35.008 --> 22:36.341
What? What do you mean?

22:36.343 --> 22:37.742
- You just answer straightaway.
- OK.

22:37.744 --> 22:39.111
How many dresses
do you own?

22:39.113 --> 22:41.145
- Si... thirty-five.
- 35 dresses is a lot!

22:41.147 --> 22:42.914
Alright. Now you ask me.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.515
Um...

22:44.517 --> 22:45.984
How many drinks have you had?

22:45.986 --> 22:48.387
27.

22:48.389 --> 22:50.155
How many times has that guy
blinked at you?

22:50.157 --> 22:52.024
- 14!
- He's blinked at you 14 times!

22:53.526 --> 22:55.327
How many times has that lady
over there given you the eye?

22:55.329 --> 22:56.727
She's given it to me
many times!

22:59.700 --> 23:01.266
- I'm gonna have to ask you...
- How old are you?

23:01.268 --> 23:02.768
..for a specific number.
49!

23:02.770 --> 23:04.103
49! Very good.

23:04.105 --> 23:05.636
- You look great.
- How old are you?

23:05.638 --> 23:07.039
26.

23:07.041 --> 23:08.539
Which is a year younger
than what I said.

23:08.541 --> 23:09.808
That's good. That's closer.

23:09.810 --> 23:11.510
Mm.

23:11.512 --> 23:12.945
How old do you think
the world is?

23:12.947 --> 23:14.680
14.

23:14.682 --> 23:16.149
And how many stars
are in the universe?

23:16.151 --> 23:17.716
- 12.
- 12?

23:27.362 --> 23:29.761
I know everything
I need to know.

23:29.763 --> 23:31.797
Yeah. How many stars
were in the universe?

23:31.799 --> 23:33.699
- 14.
- 14.

23:33.701 --> 23:35.203
Wow. Small world, isn't it?

23:36.371 --> 23:37.872
What are you gonna do now?

23:39.074 --> 23:41.006
I think we should keep
drinking, to be honest.

23:41.008 --> 23:42.408
I think we should!

23:59.828 --> 24:01.728
- Race you to the end.
- Yeah?

24:01.730 --> 24:03.763
But you've got to give me
a three-second head start.

24:03.765 --> 24:05.066
OK.

24:06.568 --> 24:07.800
You can't...!

24:07.802 --> 24:09.470
- Ooh! Ow, ow, ow!
- What?

24:09.472 --> 24:11.040
- Just kidding!
- Oh, oh!

24:12.341 --> 24:14.708
Ooh! No, shit, seriously,
this time it's...

24:30.825 --> 24:33.661
Wow!
Look how red that leaf is!

24:36.732 --> 24:38.667
- This is amazing!
- What is that?

24:40.568 --> 24:42.171
Is that berries?

24:43.939 --> 24:46.410
Wow. That's so cool.

24:47.610 --> 24:49.110
It's like coral.

24:49.112 --> 24:51.114
Half the tree's green
and half of it's red.

24:52.249 --> 24:54.683
It's a Christmas tree!

25:02.993 --> 25:06.560
Do I get anything
if I get up, like, super-high?

25:06.562 --> 25:09.264
Yes. You get
a special surprise.

25:09.266 --> 25:11.032
- OK.
- Alright.

25:11.034 --> 25:12.901
Maybe you need to take
your socks off as well.

25:12.903 --> 25:15.070
No, I feel like the
socks will give me traction.

25:15.072 --> 25:17.037
Do you?

25:17.039 --> 25:18.672
They are!

25:18.674 --> 25:20.909
- They are! They really are!
- Oh, my God!

25:22.547 --> 25:25.113
They really are actually
giving me traction!

25:25.115 --> 25:28.084
They're really giving me
a lot of traction!

25:28.086 --> 25:30.752
They're giving me
super traction!

25:30.754 --> 25:33.390
Super-duper...

25:34.958 --> 25:36.791
What do I get?

25:36.793 --> 25:38.160
I mean...

25:38.162 --> 25:39.562
What do I get?!

25:39.564 --> 25:41.196
It's so good!

25:41.198 --> 25:43.965
This is how the human evolves.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.703
Oh, that was so good!

25:48.705 --> 25:50.308
I was not
expecting that.

26:08.625 --> 26:10.392
OK, if you could go
anywhere in the world,

26:10.394 --> 26:11.694
where would you go?

26:12.964 --> 26:14.964
Weifang, Shandong, in China.

26:14.966 --> 26:16.433
For the International
Kite Festival.

26:16.435 --> 26:17.967
Really?

26:17.969 --> 26:19.969
Oh, I just read about it
this morning.

26:19.971 --> 26:22.073
OK, well,
where would you really go?

26:23.107 --> 26:25.041
I would go to
the Galápagos Islands.

26:25.043 --> 26:26.343
How come?

26:26.345 --> 26:28.111
I saw a David Attenborough
documentary

26:28.113 --> 26:29.947
and it just looks untouched.

26:31.115 --> 26:33.350
What about you?
Where would you go?

26:33.352 --> 26:36.153
I would go to Iceland.

26:36.155 --> 26:37.921
- Iceland?
- Mm-hm.

26:37.923 --> 26:39.089
Alright.

26:39.091 --> 26:40.723
Is that where the lights are?

26:40.725 --> 26:42.091
- The northern lights?
- Yeah.

26:42.093 --> 26:43.228
- Yeah.
- Cool.

26:44.229 --> 26:45.862
I mean,
I just really want that.

26:45.864 --> 26:47.864
I bet that would just
be so good.

26:47.866 --> 26:50.133
Yeah.

26:50.135 --> 26:51.868
- I did qigong once.
- Qigong?

26:51.870 --> 26:53.671
Yeah. And you go like this.

26:55.706 --> 26:57.575
Can't really remember.
But it was something like that.

27:00.712 --> 27:02.313
- Can't remember anything else.
- Well, show me.

27:02.315 --> 27:04.017
But it definitely
started with this.

27:33.313 --> 27:36.113
- After you.
- Thank you very much.

27:36.115 --> 27:37.748
I just think...
Don't you think that phobias...

27:37.750 --> 27:39.150
Phobias are irrational fears,

27:39.152 --> 27:40.750
and you keep telling me
your phobias,

27:40.752 --> 27:42.954
and it's, like, drowning
or being shot.

27:42.956 --> 27:44.722
- Or getting diabetes...
- I never said getting shot.

27:44.724 --> 27:46.692
- I said getting hit by a car.
- Completely rational fears.

27:46.694 --> 27:48.025
Thank you.

27:48.027 --> 27:51.762
So, um, have you, um...
Do you have a... a dress?

27:51.764 --> 27:53.364
Do I have a dress
or an address?

27:53.366 --> 27:54.732
No, a dress. For your...

27:54.734 --> 27:56.602
- Oh, for my wedding.
- ..your big, um...

27:56.604 --> 27:58.069
- No, I don't have a dress.
- You don't?

27:58.071 --> 27:59.571
I didn't get a dress.

27:59.573 --> 28:01.173
I didn't get a dress
the last time around,

28:01.175 --> 28:03.008
and I haven't thought about
a dress this time around.

28:03.010 --> 28:04.442
Has it been chaos...

28:04.444 --> 28:07.111
..or has someone else
kind of hijacked it for you?

28:07.113 --> 28:09.314
No, it's just been us.
I mean, it's just us.

28:09.316 --> 28:11.516
My family's not there, his
family doesn't live in London.

28:11.518 --> 28:13.118
- So, it's just been us.
- Nice.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.654
Us getting in a stew about it.

28:14.656 --> 28:16.121
Right.

28:16.123 --> 28:17.788
You know, it was gonna be
this big thing before,

28:17.790 --> 28:19.291
with all the families.

28:19.293 --> 28:21.226
It was, like, he wanted
his grandparents there

28:21.228 --> 28:22.928
and they wanted to have
this big thing...

28:22.930 --> 28:24.997
- You should elope.
- ..like, this big thing...

28:24.999 --> 28:27.132
Yeah. I don't know.

28:27.134 --> 28:30.135
I know... I know it's a big
question - are you happy?

28:30.137 --> 28:31.570
- Am I happy?
- Yeah.

28:31.572 --> 28:33.272
- Yeah, I'm happy.
- Yeah?

28:33.274 --> 28:35.073
- Are you happy?
- I'm happy. I'm OK. Yeah.

28:35.075 --> 28:37.479
I'm happy. Yeah.

29:56.359 --> 29:57.925
So, are you
from Sydney originally?

29:57.927 --> 29:59.293
Not originally, no,

29:59.295 --> 30:01.696
but I just moved back
in the last two months.

30:01.698 --> 30:02.930
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.

30:02.932 --> 30:04.298
Where were you before that?

30:04.300 --> 30:07.000
Uh... I moved in with my mum
for the last year,

30:07.002 --> 30:08.969
just because I wasn't
doing too good.

30:08.971 --> 30:10.472
- Mm-hm.
- Mm.

30:10.474 --> 30:12.275
How was it living with your mum
for a year?

30:13.443 --> 30:16.977
Look, I love her, but it was...
a nightmare.

30:16.979 --> 30:18.412
I can imagine!

30:18.414 --> 30:20.013
I just spent two weeks
with my family.

30:20.015 --> 30:21.716
- They drove me fucking crazy!
- Yeah.

30:21.718 --> 30:23.218
..really quite, uh...
quite cute.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.352
Good evening.

30:24.354 --> 30:25.720
What did he say?

30:25.722 --> 30:27.155
I don't know.

30:27.157 --> 30:29.724
We're just having a random
conversation with a stranger.

30:29.726 --> 30:31.994
We're good at that.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.800
Hello?

30:36.900 --> 30:38.734
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Um... yeah, she's here.

30:38.736 --> 30:40.034
I'll pop her on.

30:40.036 --> 30:41.236
No worries. Bye.

30:41.238 --> 30:42.771
Thank you.

30:42.773 --> 30:44.174
Hello!

30:47.077 --> 30:48.644
Hi.

30:48.646 --> 30:50.214
Yeah, did you get my message?

30:52.215 --> 30:54.916
Yeah, no, um...
well, I smashed my phone.

30:54.918 --> 30:56.521
It's...

31:00.158 --> 31:02.960
No, I-I'm coming back tomorrow.

31:08.399 --> 31:10.334
No, I want to come back, Henry.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.373
No, I want to come back.

31:19.009 --> 31:20.476
Yeah.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.079
No, it's fine.

31:23.414 --> 31:25.281
OK. Yep.

31:25.283 --> 31:26.718
Bye.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.990
Thank you.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.197
You OK?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.730
What, um, time is
your flight tomorrow?

31:41.732 --> 31:43.769
Um... 11:35.

31:45.002 --> 31:47.806
- Am I holding you up?
- No. It's, um...

31:49.741 --> 31:51.809
No, it's fine. It's fine.

31:51.811 --> 31:54.045
- It's fine. Sorry.
- It's OK.

31:55.213 --> 31:56.715
What were you saying?

31:58.417 --> 31:59.919
Huh?

32:02.655 --> 32:04.654
What do you think about that?

32:06.792 --> 32:09.659
Well, as my mother would say,
it's... interesting.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.329
Do you know what
they called it, though?

32:12.331 --> 32:13.731
What?

32:13.733 --> 32:15.935
Poo on Sticks.

32:18.103 --> 32:22.138
If art's the only thing that
remains in any civilisation,

32:22.140 --> 32:23.741
what are people
gonna think about us

32:23.743 --> 32:25.243
in a thousand years' time?

32:28.680 --> 32:30.482
Poo Sticks.

32:32.752 --> 32:34.719
- Hello, yellow!
- What's that?

32:34.721 --> 32:36.287
- Are you Aussie?
- Yeah.

32:36.289 --> 32:38.489
Then I say,
"Come on, Aussie, come on!"

32:38.491 --> 32:40.090
♪ Come on, Aussie...
Where are you from?

32:40.092 --> 32:41.491
- Are you Aussie?
- Where are you from?

32:41.493 --> 32:44.328
- Oh! Are you asking me?
- Yeah.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.796
You tell me.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.098
I don't know.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.934
No. You don't know
where I come from.

32:48.936 --> 32:50.134
You tell me.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.603
I think you come from
around here.

32:51.605 --> 32:52.837
I know you Aussie, Aussie.

32:52.839 --> 32:54.170
I'm not.

32:54.172 --> 32:56.040
She's a New Zealander.

32:56.042 --> 32:58.409
Ka mate, ka mate! Ka ora!

33:03.082 --> 33:04.315
How are you?
What's your name?

33:04.317 --> 33:06.417
Oh, it's alright. John Leonard.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.085
- John Lennon?
- No, Leonard.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.420
- Leonard?
- Ah, Leonard?

33:09.422 --> 33:10.622
Yeah. No, John LEONARD.

33:10.624 --> 33:12.123
John Leonard.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.659
I thought you said
John Lennon for a second.

33:13.661 --> 33:15.494
No, no, no, no. I wish!

33:17.297 --> 33:18.933
Yeah, brother!

33:19.967 --> 33:21.833
Oh, so, you're...'ka mate'...

33:25.172 --> 33:26.940

33:26.942 --> 33:28.574

oi, oi, oi!"

33:28.576 --> 33:29.977
Where are you from?

33:31.077 --> 33:32.479
Pick it out.

33:33.814 --> 33:35.382
- Huh?
- Work it out.

33:36.517 --> 33:38.517
You're from... you're from...

33:38.519 --> 33:40.752
Yeah! Yeah, up there,
hey, man?

33:40.754 --> 33:42.119
You're from...

33:42.121 --> 33:43.522
Wait, no, no, no, this...

33:43.524 --> 33:44.924
No, I'm pointing at that one!

33:44.926 --> 33:46.558
You said this one,
I meant that one over there!

33:48.128 --> 33:49.963
- I like you!
- Thank you very much.

33:49.965 --> 33:51.698
Yeah, OK.

Hey? What?

33:53.801 --> 33:55.802
Ummmmm...

33:55.804 --> 33:57.737

34:08.583 --> 34:10.483
I love you guys!

34:13.321 --> 34:16.054
- Bye!
- Wow. He's amazing.

34:17.891 --> 34:19.859
Oh, my goodness!

34:21.896 --> 34:23.563
♪ De de de de...

34:39.514 --> 34:40.679
Hey, hey!

34:40.681 --> 34:42.181
- What...?!
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

34:42.183 --> 34:44.020
Oi! Oi!

34:50.092 --> 34:51.725

Oh, man!

Oh.

35:05.141 --> 35:07.043

- Thank you. Thank you.

35:07.977 --> 35:09.077
Thank you so much.

35:09.079 --> 35:10.477
That scared the shit out of me.

35:10.479 --> 35:12.346
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

35:12.348 --> 35:13.982
My passport's in this bag.

35:13.984 --> 35:16.517
Fuck.

35:18.421 --> 35:21.655
Oh, my God.

35:21.657 --> 35:23.758
Ohh! Ohh!

35:23.760 --> 35:25.527
- Let's get a drink, eh?
- Yeah.

35:25.529 --> 35:27.930
Ohh!

35:31.267 --> 35:33.300
Why would you go to
the gym at this time of night?

35:34.971 --> 35:38.009
- Real commitment.
- Humans are strange.

35:53.289 --> 35:55.690
What happened to the sign?

35:55.692 --> 35:57.927
Hmm.

35:57.929 --> 35:59.694
It's not the best
advertisement, is it?

35:59.696 --> 36:01.733
No.

36:09.107 --> 36:10.808
- I like it up here.
- Mm.

36:15.847 --> 36:18.680
I spent a lot of time
on rooftop bars with my ex.

36:18.682 --> 36:20.649
She... loved them.

36:20.651 --> 36:23.588
- Really?
- Yeah. We used to come a lot.

36:25.056 --> 36:27.692
She loved having a different
perspective on life.

36:30.327 --> 36:33.562
It was funny, she used to carry
this old Leica

36:33.564 --> 36:38.536
and would take really obscure
pictures just from above.

36:39.504 --> 36:41.439
- Mm.
- She sounds great.

37:48.107 --> 37:49.509
OK.

38:54.508 --> 38:55.707
Hey, guys.
How you going?

38:55.709 --> 38:57.042
- Good.
- I'm Miles.

38:57.044 --> 38:58.644
- Hi. I'm Jasper.
- What's your name? Jasper.

38:58.646 --> 38:59.946
- And...?
- Viv.

38:59.948 --> 39:01.446
- Viv. How you going?
- Hi. How's it going?

39:01.448 --> 39:03.049
Yeah, good.
Do you guys reckon God exists?

39:03.051 --> 39:04.583
- Um...
- What do you think?

39:04.585 --> 39:07.586
Yeah, I think he exists. Jesus
Christ, he is your answer.

39:07.588 --> 39:09.688
Changed my life. Hopefully,
it'll change yours too.

39:09.690 --> 39:11.124
- Grab that.
- Thank you.

39:11.126 --> 39:12.926
Grab that. Please just read it.

39:12.928 --> 39:15.461
It's just basically talking
about how God is love.

39:15.463 --> 39:17.729
You know? And... love exists.

39:17.731 --> 39:19.365
You guys seem like
a nice couple.

39:19.367 --> 39:21.000
You guys seem in love.

39:21.002 --> 39:22.468
- Thank you.
- Have a great one. God bless.

39:22.470 --> 39:23.872
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Bye.

39:26.608 --> 39:27.976
Oh, shit!

39:45.961 --> 39:48.331
Hey, how you going?

40:13.489 --> 40:14.888
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.423
- Hi. How's it going?
- Hi. How are you?

40:16.425 --> 40:17.791
- Hi.
- Off-tap.

40:17.793 --> 40:18.926
Camp.

40:20.496 --> 40:21.929
Are you looking for anything
in particular, or just...?

40:21.931 --> 40:23.298
- Um, no, just having a look.
- Alright.

40:23.300 --> 40:24.765
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Need a hand, give me a call.

40:24.767 --> 40:26.067
- OK. Thank you.
- Thanks.

40:26.069 --> 40:28.969
But couples - look at this.
Wet & Wild.

40:28.971 --> 40:30.537
Oh, my goodness.
That's so...

40:30.539 --> 40:33.375
It's out there. It's out there.

40:33.377 --> 40:35.176
There we go.
This is the We-Vibe.

40:35.178 --> 40:37.012
Show them the We-Vibe.

40:37.014 --> 40:39.780
This can go inside your vagina,
this side, the flat side.

40:39.782 --> 40:42.082
- Uh-huh.
- It's on the... on the outside.

40:42.084 --> 40:43.550
And then he can come in
behind it.

40:43.552 --> 40:45.820
- What it is is two motors...
- Have a feel, darling.

40:45.822 --> 40:47.722
- ..wireless remote control.
- You play with...

40:47.724 --> 40:50.992
It goes into the lady
like a Muppet, yeah?

40:52.561 --> 40:54.429
And your ding-a-ling is going
underneath while it's worn.

40:54.431 --> 40:57.332
So, it's virtually a built-in
vibrating cock ring.

40:57.334 --> 40:59.368
- It's all about togetherness!
- Have a go on that.

40:59.370 --> 41:01.170
And she could be in the bank
at the counter

41:01.172 --> 41:02.604
and you could be in the car.

41:02.606 --> 41:04.571
- "Zzhhh! Zzhhh!"
- And it's all...?

41:04.573 --> 41:06.608
- It's worn inside...
- That's really doing it.

41:06.610 --> 41:08.009
..while you're fucking.

41:08.011 --> 41:09.811
- So, think this would be...
- Excuse the French.

41:11.382 --> 41:13.282
- Wow. There's an app.
- The We-Vibe is pretty cool.

41:13.284 --> 41:14.616
Whoa!

41:14.618 --> 41:15.850
Can't turn it off.

41:15.852 --> 41:17.886
Meet... your new best friend.

41:17.888 --> 41:20.222
Two drops on
your friend's jim-jam

41:20.224 --> 41:22.824
makes it
hypersensitive insanity.

41:22.826 --> 41:25.861
I've used it on the front line,
sir. It works.

41:25.863 --> 41:27.163
- Watermelon mouth...
- Seen the rabbit?

41:27.165 --> 41:28.497
- No.
- Sex and the City!

41:28.499 --> 41:29.697
The girl in Sex and the City.

41:29.699 --> 41:31.033
All these ladies
know about the rabbit!

41:31.035 --> 41:32.435
- It's the famous rabbit.
- THE rabbit!

41:32.437 --> 41:34.503
So, I think Susan or Samantha -
the slut...

41:34.505 --> 41:35.938
- Samantha!
- ..brought it to the table.

41:35.940 --> 41:38.607
- The slut!
- Pfft. Yeah, yeah, darls.

41:38.609 --> 41:39.841
I'll put some
batteries in and...

41:39.843 --> 41:41.177
What are the little,
um, pearls inside?

41:41.179 --> 41:42.545
- Oh!
- Ooh!

41:42.547 --> 41:43.611
You're in for a REAL treat.

41:43.613 --> 41:45.014
I'm putting
the batteries in, darls.

41:46.452 --> 41:47.950
Oh, yeah, that's got
aphrodisiacs in that too.

41:47.952 --> 41:49.352
It's olive oil,
so you can use it as lube,

41:49.354 --> 41:50.653
but it's no good for condoms.

41:50.655 --> 41:52.788
The famous rabbit. This is...

41:52.790 --> 41:54.690
Hang on. Yes.

41:54.692 --> 41:57.593
- Check... You've got a few.
- Oh, love!

41:57.595 --> 41:59.662
Imagine that inside you, darls!
Ooh-la-la!

41:59.664 --> 42:01.531
Here, feel... feel that bit.

42:01.533 --> 42:03.033
They reckon
the most sensitive bit...

42:03.035 --> 42:04.333
You too if you want it, honey!

42:04.335 --> 42:06.902
..on a lady,
bar her little jim-jam...

42:06.904 --> 42:08.105
Get it going, love!

42:08.107 --> 42:09.772
I got into trouble
for saying "clitoris"...

42:09.774 --> 42:11.174
- Pump it up!
- ..to these lesbian dudes,

42:11.176 --> 42:14.778
so now I say "jim-jam",
"jelly bean", "pearl"...

42:14.780 --> 42:16.212
- It can go in the bath.
- Just feel that.

42:16.214 --> 42:17.646
- Really? It's waterproof?
- Mm.

42:17.648 --> 42:20.484
But the tip of your nose
is hypersensitive...

42:20.486 --> 42:22.752
- Ooh-la-la!
- Oh!

42:22.754 --> 42:24.555
- It's out there, but, yeah.
- Is that, um...

42:24.557 --> 42:26.290
- A few functions there.
- How out there is it, darls?

42:26.292 --> 42:28.024
- Wow.
- Can he use it too?

42:28.026 --> 42:30.093
- Hi, guys. How are you?
- Thanks.

42:30.095 --> 42:32.597
- Well, of course he can.
- Hi, darling. How are you?

42:32.599 --> 42:34.898
Hi, darling. How aren't you?

42:34.900 --> 42:36.334
But I'm saying, the jim-jam...

42:36.336 --> 42:38.835
..the comparison, most
sensitive part in one's body

42:38.837 --> 42:40.170
is the tip of your nose, so...

42:40.172 --> 42:42.105
- Everybody?
- Yeah, wow.

42:42.107 --> 42:43.574
The We... Tango.

42:43.576 --> 42:46.577
- Look out. He loves the Tango.
- I love it. Look.

42:46.579 --> 42:48.012
- Feel it slip in. Ooh!
- Whoa!

42:48.014 --> 42:49.780
- Just leave it on your palm...
- It's like a fish.

42:49.782 --> 42:51.249
- He loves the Tango.
- Arggh!

42:51.251 --> 42:53.083
Yeah! You throw that up your
clacker. I'd be too scared to.

42:53.085 --> 42:54.751
Might never get it out!

42:54.753 --> 42:56.820
You've got so many functions.
Keep pressing the bottom of it.

42:56.822 --> 42:58.189
It's got that one
where it goes...

42:58.191 --> 42:59.924
It's a powerhouse. You've got
a one-year warranty.

42:59.926 --> 43:01.392
That's the We-Vibe's
little brother.

43:01.394 --> 43:03.127
Hard to keep
a hold of, that little guy.

43:03.129 --> 43:04.928
It's hard to keep in
too, darls.

43:04.930 --> 43:06.663
Just jumps and jumps
and jumps!

43:06.665 --> 43:08.900
You know, it's for a couple,
love, so they have a game.

43:08.902 --> 43:11.702
- It's got... a lot of...
- We're not a couple.

43:11.704 --> 43:13.272
Not a couple? But, well,
you know, you could be.

43:13.274 --> 43:14.772
Whoa!

43:14.774 --> 43:17.375
And it's all rechargeable too,
love. See what I mean?

43:17.377 --> 43:20.044
Imagine two of them in me,
love! Ohhh, love! I'd be...

43:20.046 --> 43:22.046
I was like that before!

43:22.048 --> 43:24.383
Oh, it's camp, love! Ding!

43:24.385 --> 43:26.318
You know... you know,
we know you're not together,

43:26.320 --> 43:28.085
but even friends can be
naughty, yeah?

43:28.087 --> 43:29.588
Right.

43:29.590 --> 43:31.456
- Can't they? I don't know.
- They have to be.

43:31.458 --> 43:34.293
What are friends for? You've
got to learn with your friends.

43:34.295 --> 43:36.395
Can I ask, what, um...
what's with the... the blue?

43:36.397 --> 43:38.230
Oh. I have Irlen syndrome.

43:38.232 --> 43:41.098
Rhymes with 'Merlin',
the magician, but with an I.

43:41.100 --> 43:44.236
It's from being under
these lights for a decade.

43:44.238 --> 43:47.539
One of the trade-offs
of being a front-line, uh...

43:47.541 --> 43:49.808
..humble porn-peddler,
love-preacher

43:49.810 --> 43:51.610
in a crazy, twisted world.

43:52.912 --> 43:54.146
Someone's got to be out there,

43:54.148 --> 43:56.114
a beacon of light
for 'friends'...

43:56.116 --> 43:57.816
- Yeah, right.
- ..and lovers alike!

43:57.818 --> 43:59.384
Yeah, we're saving marriages
down here!

43:59.386 --> 44:01.354
- Look at that.
- Whoa! He's got...

44:01.356 --> 44:03.356
That's sex on the rocks!

44:03.358 --> 44:05.991
You will definitely get an
orgasm with one of these three.

44:05.993 --> 44:07.594
But he's outrageous.

44:07.596 --> 44:10.095
- Kink, baby! Ooh-la-la!
- Ooh! Oh, oh! Whoa!

44:10.097 --> 44:12.831
You want to try it, darls?
You try it. Give him a smack.

44:12.833 --> 44:14.701
Ooh! He's probably been
real naughty.

44:14.703 --> 44:17.936
Then you go with the paddle.
Ohhh, yeah!

44:17.938 --> 44:20.739
- He likes it! Ooh-la-la!
- He's causing trouble.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.376
You've got the cuffs.
You've got cuffs with furs.

44:23.378 --> 44:24.711
Ooh, how about your nipples?

44:24.713 --> 44:26.346
You like your nipples
to be clamped?

44:26.348 --> 44:28.247
Jingle-jam.

44:28.249 --> 44:30.250
I think we should go.

44:30.252 --> 44:32.051
- How did you guys meet?
- Do youse know each other?

44:32.053 --> 44:34.254
- Well, we, uh...
- We do now!

44:34.256 --> 44:35.888
So, were you interested
in the We-Vibe

44:35.890 --> 44:37.156
or anything like that, love?

44:37.158 --> 44:38.659
- Um... we might...
- I think we're OK.

44:38.661 --> 44:40.493
You're OK? You're just gonna
have a... on the rocks tonight?

44:40.495 --> 44:41.594
Well, alright, then.

44:41.596 --> 44:42.828
- Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

44:42.830 --> 44:44.831
See you, guys. Have fun.
Look after each other.

44:44.833 --> 44:46.634
- Bye.
- Come back. We're 24 hours.

44:46.636 --> 44:48.535
Bye, cutie.
I finish at 11 - don't forget.

44:48.537 --> 44:50.237
Three, four in the morning,
you know where to come.

44:50.239 --> 44:51.738
You've got the whip out.
I'd better get going.

44:51.740 --> 44:53.773
Bye.

44:53.775 --> 44:55.578
Cute!

44:56.712 --> 44:58.013
Off-tap.

45:02.718 --> 45:04.984
What's this? Do you want to do
a breath alcohol tester?

45:04.986 --> 45:07.020
- Sure.
- I need two $1 coins.

45:07.022 --> 45:09.490
You're either gonna be 'error',
'OK', 'warning' or 'danger'.

45:09.492 --> 45:11.592
I think you're gonna be
'danger'.

45:11.594 --> 45:13.294
Roll up, roll up!

45:13.296 --> 45:14.698
Rrroll up, rrroll up!

45:24.106 --> 45:26.474
Warning. I'm just a warning.

45:26.476 --> 45:27.777
Uh-huh.

45:31.514 --> 45:32.880
Blow.

45:39.455 --> 45:43.658
- Danger! Danger!
- I'm 0.077!

45:43.660 --> 45:46.294
- Danger!
- I should be dead.

45:46.296 --> 45:47.698
Mm.

45:52.736 --> 45:55.171
Go...

45:57.140 --> 45:59.974
Go up on your toes.
Get low, then up on the toes.

46:08.185 --> 46:09.617
Pretend you never saw that.

46:09.619 --> 46:10.852
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's gone.

46:10.854 --> 46:12.189
- Alright.
- It's gone.

46:15.058 --> 46:16.892
Wow.

46:18.161 --> 46:19.594
I know.

46:19.596 --> 46:20.895
Other tricks?

46:20.897 --> 46:22.866
Can you do,
like, a little spin?

46:24.335 --> 46:26.736
Whoa!

46:26.738 --> 46:28.905
- See you.
- See you.

46:32.142 --> 46:33.975
Have you heard that
in the English language,

46:33.977 --> 46:36.779
there's only, like, three words
that don't rhyme?

46:36.781 --> 46:38.681
'Orange' is one of them.

46:38.683 --> 46:40.415
- Yeah.
- Doesn't rhyme with anything.

46:40.417 --> 46:42.016
I think 'purple' is another.

46:42.018 --> 46:43.619
I don't know what
the third one is.

46:43.621 --> 46:46.389
- I really want to know now.
- Excuse me? Guys? Sorry.

46:46.391 --> 46:50.092
Do you have, um, $3.50? $3.50?

46:50.094 --> 46:51.627
Uh...

46:51.629 --> 46:54.298
- Sorry about that.
- I don't have any cash.

46:55.666 --> 46:57.433
- No, I don't. Sorry.
- I don't have change. Sorry.

46:57.435 --> 46:59.435
Do you know if it's any good,
this one?

46:59.437 --> 47:01.338
- This restaurant?
- Yeah.

47:01.340 --> 47:03.739
Uh, I don't know.
I've never been here. Sorry.

47:03.741 --> 47:06.142
- Looks nice.
- Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

47:06.144 --> 47:09.546
It's just that... you know...
"Established 1996".

47:09.548 --> 47:13.150
It's, like... 1996 - in Europe,
it would have been 1886.

47:13.152 --> 47:15.351
Yeah! 1996 in Australia!

47:15.353 --> 47:16.986
- Yeah! Whoo! We made it!
- Right.

47:16.988 --> 47:18.254
- Sorry. Anyway...
- That's OK.

47:18.256 --> 47:19.723
- That's alright.
- I wasn't that hungry.

47:19.725 --> 47:20.990
Do you want a...?

47:20.992 --> 47:22.359
Uh, I'm OK.
Thank you, though.

47:22.361 --> 47:23.860
- Do you want...?
- Yeah, I'll have one.

47:23.862 --> 47:25.462
- Alright.
- Thank you.

47:25.464 --> 47:27.997
Do you want me to show you
a trick? I'll show you a trick.

47:27.999 --> 47:31.334
You look so... It's so cold!
It was so warm this morning!

47:31.336 --> 47:33.703
It was really hot today,
and then it changes.

47:33.705 --> 47:35.338
Yeah. Come.

47:35.340 --> 47:38.910
You can do it, then, to her.

47:46.285 --> 47:47.451
Huh? Huh?

47:47.453 --> 47:49.019
That's
actually really good.

47:49.021 --> 47:51.822
Yeah, I'm quite warm now.

47:51.824 --> 47:53.623
- I'll show you how...
- Yeah?

47:53.625 --> 47:56.426
..how you do it, and then
you should do this to her.

47:59.599 --> 48:01.033
It tickles.

48:02.903 --> 48:05.302
That's really nice.

48:05.304 --> 48:07.538
- Quite warm now.
- Eto teplo, da. Eto teplo.

48:12.312 --> 48:13.711
Sorry...

48:13.713 --> 48:15.479
Sorry... sorry, what?

48:19.819 --> 48:21.152
What does that mean?

48:21.154 --> 48:23.022
27, two kids.

48:26.326 --> 48:27.660
Oh, my God!

48:29.496 --> 48:31.197
"27 and two kids"?

48:32.398 --> 48:33.899
And then she touched my hand.

48:37.003 --> 48:38.806
What the hell?

48:40.975 --> 48:42.540
- Eugh!
- That's so weird.

48:42.542 --> 48:45.076
I don't want to eat this,
but my grandpa told me a story

48:45.078 --> 48:48.580
and he said, "If a little kid
offers you a candy,

48:48.582 --> 48:50.984
"you should take it, 'cause
that's all they have to offer."

48:50.986 --> 48:53.017
And I feel like
she was like a little kid.

48:54.220 --> 48:56.590
But that was,
I think, a bit strange.

49:02.296 --> 49:04.696
- What's in here?
- Let's give it a go.

49:04.698 --> 49:06.365
- Hey, man.
- Hi, guys.

49:06.367 --> 49:07.699
- Hi.
- How have you been?

49:07.701 --> 49:09.002
- How's it going?
- You good?

49:09.004 --> 49:11.270
- Can we come in?
- Uh...

49:11.272 --> 49:12.707
- Been here before?
- Yeah.

49:14.141 --> 49:15.941
- Alright, guys. Yep.
- Thank you.

49:15.943 --> 49:17.144
No worries.

49:24.118 --> 49:25.787
- Oh, my God.
- Right.

49:27.022 --> 49:28.420
I thought it was gonna be,
like, a big...

49:28.422 --> 49:30.122
I don't know
what's going on!

49:30.124 --> 49:32.959
..a big...
like, a big, pumping party.

49:32.961 --> 49:34.460
I know. But, um...

49:34.462 --> 49:35.962
Like, it's like
an intimate gathering.

49:38.266 --> 49:39.766
- OK.
- What do we do?

49:39.768 --> 49:41.133
OK. I can dig it.

49:41.135 --> 49:42.902
I can dig it.

49:42.904 --> 49:44.404
- Hello.
- Hello.

49:44.406 --> 49:45.805
How are we?

49:45.807 --> 49:47.373
- Good.
- Good. How are you?

49:47.375 --> 49:48.876
I'm fine. What can I get you?

49:48.878 --> 49:50.343
- Uh... champ...
- Champ...

49:50.345 --> 49:51.744
Yeah? Champagne?

49:51.746 --> 49:53.682
- Excuse me? Hello?
- Two champagnes?

49:54.716 --> 49:56.149
Who invited you guys here?

49:56.151 --> 49:57.550
- Sorry?
- Who invited you?

49:57.552 --> 49:58.986
Are you guys on the guest list?

49:58.988 --> 50:00.621
- Um... no.
- Um... no, we're not.

50:00.623 --> 50:01.855
But we... we, um...

50:01.857 --> 50:03.790
We're just gonna have
a champagne.

50:03.792 --> 50:05.858
- Just a little champagne.
- Two champagnes.

50:05.860 --> 50:07.293
Just a very little champagne.

50:07.295 --> 50:09.295
OK. Just one drink.

50:09.297 --> 50:10.965
Just one
very little champagne.

50:10.967 --> 50:12.366
- OK.
- Thank you.

50:12.368 --> 50:14.100
- Thanks. Thank you.
- OK.

50:14.102 --> 50:16.137
- One.
- Thank you.

50:20.275 --> 50:21.775
You're thinking about it.
Stop thinking about it!

50:38.361 --> 50:39.793
A banana's way more
perishable...

50:39.795 --> 50:42.765
Yeah, but you can freeze a
cantaloupe. You can't freeze...

50:44.101 --> 50:45.599
- Hiya.
- Hi. How are you?

50:45.601 --> 50:47.334
- How's it going?
- Good. I'm Dean.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.403
- Oh, hi. I'm Viv.
- Hi, Viv.

50:49.405 --> 50:51.271
- Oh, thank you.
- Jasper.

50:51.273 --> 50:52.740
- Hi, Jasper. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

50:52.742 --> 50:54.976
Uh, can I have a beer,
please, mate?

50:54.978 --> 50:56.678
- I like your hair.
- Oh, thank you.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.245
- Yeah, it's great.
- Thank you. Mm.

50:58.247 --> 50:59.681
- No pain, no gain, right?
- What do you dye it with?

50:59.683 --> 51:01.783
Um... it's called Manic Panic.

51:01.785 --> 51:03.784
- Oh, yeah. I know Manic Panic.
- Mm.

51:03.786 --> 51:05.519
Good. How often
do you change it?

51:05.521 --> 51:08.056
Um... as often as
my mood changes.

51:08.058 --> 51:10.025
- Fair enough.
- Which is quite often. Mm.

51:10.027 --> 51:11.726
Actually, my hair's
gonna fall out

51:11.728 --> 51:13.194
'cause I bleach it too much.

51:13.196 --> 51:14.764
Mm. Mm-hm.

51:14.766 --> 51:16.865
- What are you up to tonight?
- Um...

51:16.867 --> 51:18.066
We kind of ran into each other.

51:18.068 --> 51:19.634
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

51:19.636 --> 51:21.302
Well, spontaneity is the
best thing in life, isn't it?

51:21.304 --> 51:23.505
- Ah, cool.
- True. Cheers to that.

51:23.507 --> 51:25.141
Cheers. In fact, I should have
a champagne too.

51:25.143 --> 51:26.709
- But anyway, beer will do.
- Have a champagne.

51:26.711 --> 51:28.543
- So, you just met today?
- Mm.

51:28.545 --> 51:30.345
- Drinking champagne already?
- Mm.

51:30.347 --> 51:32.148
Oh!

51:32.150 --> 51:33.581
Actually, I look at you, honey,

51:33.583 --> 51:35.350
and I think of things I haven't
thought of in decades, hey?

51:36.721 --> 51:37.953
Thanks, Dean.

51:37.955 --> 51:39.387
Then I look at Jasper
and I think of something

51:39.389 --> 51:40.722
I thought of five minutes ago,
you know?

51:42.626 --> 51:44.426
She's getting
engaged tomorrow.

51:44.428 --> 51:45.995
No, you're flying to see
your fiancé tomorrow.

51:45.997 --> 51:47.063
I am engaged.

51:47.065 --> 51:48.564
That makes sense to me,
honey. Course.

51:48.566 --> 51:50.067
Last fling. Good on you.
Congratulations.

51:50.069 --> 51:51.466
No!

51:51.468 --> 51:52.667
What the cat doesn't know
doesn't hurt, eh?

51:52.669 --> 51:54.036
- No!
- Good on you.

51:54.038 --> 51:55.504
- It's not like that, Dean.
- Are you sure?

51:55.506 --> 51:56.739
- It's not like that.
- It looks like that to me.

51:56.741 --> 51:57.907
Oh, God!

51:57.909 --> 51:59.142
If it's not like that with him,

51:59.144 --> 52:00.776
can you make it like that
with me?

52:00.778 --> 52:02.912
Mm.

52:02.914 --> 52:04.345
Would you like to dance?

52:04.347 --> 52:06.482
- Alright.
- With you? Anything.

52:06.484 --> 52:08.417
Well, actually, can I be
the meat in your sandwich?

52:10.122 --> 52:11.788
Looks like you're forming
a sandwich tonight anyway!

52:13.357 --> 52:14.825
Oh, a great song on there.

52:14.827 --> 52:16.992
- Please.
- Here, hold on. Mm.

52:19.664 --> 52:21.865
Dean...

52:21.867 --> 52:23.867
Oh, my God. Dean, please.

52:23.869 --> 52:26.703
Gee, I wish I could get down
and... and down further.

52:28.306 --> 52:29.705
Jasper can do...
Jasper can do some drops.

52:29.707 --> 52:31.041
I can do the little drops.

52:31.043 --> 52:32.709
..down like that!

52:32.711 --> 52:34.411
Well, while you're
down there, hello!

52:34.413 --> 52:36.580
Well, we'd better be careful.
We might get kicked out.

52:36.582 --> 52:39.348
Oh, no. There's no-one here.
They want our money.

52:41.153 --> 52:43.220
- Salud.
- Salud to you too.

52:43.222 --> 52:45.822
- Lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you too.

55:48.744 --> 55:53.614
I want to make it fun and sexy
and just go, whoof!

55:53.616 --> 55:56.717
Just... amiga.

55:56.719 --> 55:58.752
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

55:58.754 --> 56:00.188
Look at... Oh, shit.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.958
- Hey!
- Hi.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.192
That's you!

56:05.194 --> 56:06.927
- How was your drink?
- Mrs Cutie Patootie.

56:06.929 --> 56:09.130
- It was good.
- You enjoyed it?

56:09.132 --> 56:11.366
- Yes, thank you.
- Yeah.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.068
- Cute dress.
- That boy out there...

56:13.070 --> 56:15.502
- Sorry.
- Is that your boyfriend?

56:15.504 --> 56:18.073
- No, he's just a friend.
- A friend, my ass!

56:18.075 --> 56:20.108
You guys were very close.

56:20.110 --> 56:21.475
No, he's just a friend.

56:21.477 --> 56:23.278
- Very close, that friend.
- I'm engaged.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.879
You're engaged?
Let me see your ring.

56:24.881 --> 56:26.282
- Does he live here?
- I don't have it on.

56:26.284 --> 56:28.016
You don't have a ring?
So you're not engaged.

56:28.018 --> 56:30.584
- No, I am engaged.
- Not on purpose.

56:30.586 --> 56:31.953
It's just between us.

56:31.955 --> 56:33.555
No, it's...
It's true, I promise.

56:33.557 --> 56:35.324
No, I don't believe that.
Anyways...

56:35.326 --> 56:36.591
Are you guys having
a good night?

56:36.593 --> 56:38.294
- Um...
- Um... I don't know.

56:38.296 --> 56:39.694
We want to make it
more interesting.

56:39.696 --> 56:41.629
Are you and him
a little bit bored like us?

56:41.631 --> 56:43.865
No, we're having quite
an exciting night, actually.

56:43.867 --> 56:45.368
Really? What have you
been up to?

56:45.370 --> 56:47.436
Um... we found a dog.

56:47.438 --> 56:49.205
- A dog?
- Yep.

56:49.207 --> 56:51.873
What about if you found girls
like us? What would you do?

56:51.875 --> 56:54.109
- We're not dogs!
- You're not dogs.

56:54.111 --> 56:57.213
- We're not dogs. We're women.
- What?!

56:57.215 --> 56:59.915
Alright.
Have a good night.

56:59.917 --> 57:02.018
- Have fun.
- No! Don't go.

57:02.020 --> 57:03.585
- Let's have a dance.
- A dance?!

57:03.587 --> 57:05.054
- Yeah!
- I can't dance.

57:05.056 --> 57:06.922
- Oh, my God!
- I don't do dancing.

57:06.924 --> 57:10.192
I'll teach you.
Let's dance. Let's move around.

57:10.194 --> 57:12.429
Come on. You just go like this.

57:12.431 --> 57:14.464
- Uh-huh?
- You see?

57:14.466 --> 57:17.133
Touch your dress,
your boobs, your hair.

57:17.135 --> 57:18.634
No, no...

57:18.636 --> 57:21.405
- You can do it. Don't be shy.
- I just can't do it.

57:21.407 --> 57:23.473
- Yes, you can do it.
- In fact...

57:23.475 --> 57:26.708
You have to do it for your
'friend'. Your boyfriend.

57:26.710 --> 57:28.277
Just do it.

57:28.279 --> 57:29.812
Is she teaching you the moves?

57:29.814 --> 57:31.614
Yeah, she's teaching.
Giving me a special lesson.

57:31.616 --> 57:33.083
The Puerto Rican dance.

57:33.085 --> 57:34.617
I mean, there's no music
out there.

57:34.619 --> 57:37.354
- Let's have the party in here.
- Ohh.

57:41.793 --> 57:44.194
- Is she going cra-zee?
- Yeah, she's going for it.

57:44.196 --> 57:48.365
Is she going-going cra-zee?
Uh! Uh-huh!

57:48.367 --> 57:51.435
- Yeah.
- That's really good.

58:09.188 --> 58:10.555
- Hi.
- Hi, hon.

58:10.557 --> 58:12.889
- Is Jasper here?
- I think he's left.

58:12.891 --> 58:15.127
- He left?
- Oh, I think so. Yeah.

58:17.629 --> 58:19.031
OK.

58:24.804 --> 58:26.037
Goodnight.

58:26.039 --> 58:27.405
Yeah, nice to meet you.
All the best.

58:27.407 --> 58:28.807
You too. Yep.

01:00:50.219 --> 01:00:51.918
Jasper! Jasper!

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.222
Viv!

01:00:56.692 --> 01:00:58.060
Viv!

01:00:59.328 --> 01:01:01.195
- Where'd you go?
- You left.

01:01:01.197 --> 01:01:02.929
What? No, no.
The guy said that YOU'D left.

01:01:02.931 --> 01:01:04.331
The guy told me
that YOU'D left.

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:05.432
What? No!

01:01:05.434 --> 01:01:07.001
- You didn't go?!
- No!

01:01:07.003 --> 01:01:09.036
Oh, my God! I went around...
I've been looking for you!

01:01:09.038 --> 01:01:10.338
Sorry.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.772
I thought you just...
offed and went.

01:01:11.774 --> 01:01:13.541
No, I thought
that YOU'D just gone!

01:01:13.543 --> 01:01:14.908
Oh, my God!

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:16.310
I thought you just got up
and left!

01:01:16.312 --> 01:01:19.079
- No! Oh!
- Oh, my God!

01:01:22.918 --> 01:01:24.621
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:29.658
..and then just
puts it back down.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.127
His face is like... Wild.

01:01:32.129 --> 01:01:33.728
Shots. Yeah!

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.364
Hey, baby!

01:01:36.366 --> 01:01:37.799
Mwah. Mwah.

01:01:37.801 --> 01:01:39.967
Oh! Oh, you're so funny!

01:01:39.969 --> 01:01:43.004
Hey, darling. How are you?

01:01:43.006 --> 01:01:45.641
Ha-ha!

01:01:45.643 --> 01:01:48.176
- Oh, my love!
- Hey, baby.

01:01:48.178 --> 01:01:51.079
Arggh!

01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:54.717
- Shot, shot, shot!
- Yeah! Alright!

01:01:54.719 --> 01:01:56.320
Whoo!

01:01:58.255 --> 01:01:59.357
Ugh!

01:02:00.558 --> 01:02:03.325
Yes, I did. I loved
that movie. Thank you.

01:02:18.975 --> 01:02:21.310
Alright! Yeah!

01:02:21.312 --> 01:02:22.713
Yeah!

01:02:27.918 --> 01:02:29.518
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.122
So yummy!

01:02:32.523 --> 01:02:34.190
Ooh!

01:02:43.167 --> 01:02:44.603

..not really.

01:04:57.238 --> 01:04:58.607

Um...

01:05:08.015 --> 01:05:09.618
I am...

01:05:11.419 --> 01:05:14.188
I don't know. It's just been
a weird few months, and...

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.426
..I'm not sure how much
Henry wants me to...

01:05:19.694 --> 01:05:21.794

What do you mean?

01:05:23.164 --> 01:05:24.397
I sort of came over here

01:05:24.399 --> 01:05:26.902
so that we could have
a bit of time, you know?

01:05:28.102 --> 01:05:29.404
Um...

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.677

Mm...

01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:48.255
It's just been a...

01:05:48.257 --> 01:05:49.725
..been a weird time.

01:05:51.961 --> 01:05:53.526
In what way?

01:05:53.528 --> 01:05:55.930
I had a miscarriage
a couple of months ago,

01:05:55.932 --> 01:05:57.466
and, um...

01:05:58.734 --> 01:06:00.136
..he just...

01:06:01.805 --> 01:06:04.538
..you know, it's been
really, really hard for him.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.543
It's been hard for both of us,
obviously, but...

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.850
..I feel like he...

01:06:19.088 --> 01:06:23.125
Mm... it's not that
he blames me, just...

01:06:24.561 --> 01:06:27.530
..he kind of resents the fact
that I...

01:06:31.768 --> 01:06:34.136
- ..wasn't able to... you know?
- Yeah.

01:06:38.107 --> 01:06:39.808
Don't...

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:42.077
Don't take that on board.
You can't...

No, it's not... it's not...

01:06:44.881 --> 01:06:46.483
It's just...

01:06:49.787 --> 01:06:52.489
..distanced us a bit, I guess.

01:06:55.359 --> 01:06:58.261
I don't know.
We'll see. We'll see.

01:07:04.267 --> 01:07:05.736
I'm really sorry to hear that.

01:07:09.807 --> 01:07:11.308
Tonight's been good, though.

01:07:15.079 --> 01:07:17.245
It's been lovely.

01:07:17.247 --> 01:07:18.983
It's been really nice.

01:07:30.293 --> 01:07:32.294
OK, now, this is gonna be
a little bit tricky.

01:07:32.296 --> 01:07:33.429
That's OK.

01:07:33.431 --> 01:07:34.797
You've got to keep
your eyes shut

01:07:34.799 --> 01:07:36.532
to get across this, OK?

01:07:36.534 --> 01:07:39.537
- Do I need to? Do I want to?
- Just wait till I'm gone.

01:07:40.705 --> 01:07:42.807
- OK.
- Mm-hm.

01:07:44.008 --> 01:07:45.708
OK. Keep going.

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:47.578
- Just keep going.
- Mm-hm.

01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:50.081
OK, keep going.

01:07:51.149 --> 01:07:52.750
OK. Keep going.

01:07:54.619 --> 01:07:56.585
- Here. Keep going.
- Mm-hm.

01:07:56.587 --> 01:07:58.220
- OK, now you shut your eyes.
- Mm-hm.

01:07:58.222 --> 01:07:59.723
- Keep them shut.
- Mm-hm.

01:07:59.725 --> 01:08:02.024
OK. And you have to
bend down.

01:08:02.026 --> 01:08:03.126
Mm-hm.

01:08:03.128 --> 01:08:04.527
- Bend down.
- Yes.

01:08:04.529 --> 01:08:05.929
And then come forward
a little bit.

01:08:12.571 --> 01:08:13.970
Was that a good surprise?

01:08:13.972 --> 01:08:15.371
- It was a great surprise.
- Oh!

01:08:15.373 --> 01:08:16.773
I don't think you we're
surprised enough.

01:08:16.774 --> 01:08:17.810
No, I was!

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:25.348
Oh! Two.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.683
What is it?

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:30.386
It's a... a little maze
with ball bearings.

01:08:30.389 --> 01:08:32.291
And I'm gonna get it.

01:08:33.492 --> 01:08:34.959
I need your support here.

01:08:34.961 --> 01:08:36.728
I'm supporting you
from over here.

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:40.497
OK. Just tell me...
"Yes, yes, yes."

01:08:40.499 --> 01:08:42.701
"This is it. This is it."

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.606
No, that's not for me,
that game.

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.575
It's not for me.

01:08:51.577 --> 01:08:53.111
A good one.

01:09:07.026 --> 01:09:08.528
What are you thinking about?

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.362
I was thinking about Darwin.

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:12.965
The person or the place?

01:09:12.966 --> 01:09:14.899
The place.

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:16.501
What about it?

01:09:16.502 --> 01:09:18.336
I went there with my dad once,

01:09:18.337 --> 01:09:20.671
and I just remember
mango trees.

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:25.712
What about you?
What are you thinking about?

01:09:26.845 --> 01:09:29.081
I was thinking about
John Leonard.

01:09:40.828 --> 01:09:42.227
Do you know that story
about John Lennon?

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:44.129
No.

01:09:44.131 --> 01:09:46.965
When he was, like,
five years old at school,

01:09:46.966 --> 01:09:49.635
he had to write down what he
wanted to be when he grew up,

01:09:49.636 --> 01:09:51.770
and he wrote down "happy".

01:09:51.772 --> 01:09:53.372
And the teacher, like...

01:09:54.575 --> 01:09:56.575
..took him aside after class
and said,

01:09:56.577 --> 01:09:58.343
"You've written down 'happy'.

01:09:58.345 --> 01:10:00.379
"You don't understand
the question."

01:10:00.381 --> 01:10:03.782
And he said,
"You don't understand life."

01:10:12.194 --> 01:10:13.726

do you have?

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.541

01:10:36.185 --> 01:10:38.652
- I have one.
- One!

01:13:19.584 --> 01:13:22.285
Excuse me? Do you have a pen
that I can borrow?

01:13:22.287 --> 01:13:24.156
- Yeah.
- Cool. Thank you.

01:13:29.294 --> 01:13:32.064

No, don't... don't worry.

01:14:02.294 --> 01:14:03.929
