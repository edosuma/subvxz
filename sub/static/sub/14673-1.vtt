<i>This is Rick Dees.</i>

00:44.819 --> 00:49.779
<i>If you want a song played,</i>
<i>call the radio station right now.</i>

00:51.960 --> 00:55.987
<i>You park in an abandoned lot.</i>
<i>You attend the movie.</i>

00:56.297 --> 01:01.030
<i>You come out to find that thieves</i>
<i>have ripped off your stereo.</i>

01:07.108 --> 01:09.167
<i>This wouldn't have happened...</i>

01:09.377 --> 01:14.679
<i>...if you'd purchased the</i>
<i>James Brown auto alarm! Listen!</i>

01:19.520 --> 01:24.856
<i>The James Brown auto alarm,</i>
<i>scattering thieves near and far!</i>

01:25.493 --> 01:27.654
<i>The James Brown auto alarm.</i>

01:27.996 --> 01:30.362
<i>Get yours today!</i>

02:32.060 --> 02:33.925
What are you doing?

02:34.262 --> 02:36.594
-Here.
-Oh, never mind.

02:42.303 --> 02:43.895
Morning.

02:48.910 --> 02:50.605
Coffee.

02:54.916 --> 02:58.545
What time did you go home
last night, 3:00 a.m.?

02:58.753 --> 03:01.881
You look like you've been
in a plane crash.

03:02.090 --> 03:07.460
-This may shock you, but humans sleep.
-I know, I know.

03:08.463 --> 03:12.991
Gruen gave me a big project.
I think it's some kind of test.

03:13.267 --> 03:17.465
Where's my depreciation schedule?
I've lost my deprec--

03:18.406 --> 03:21.432
I think I have everything.
Profit plan...

03:22.610 --> 03:24.168
...flow charts....

03:24.445 --> 03:28.142
-How much time do I have?
-Four minutes.

03:29.951 --> 03:31.851
Walter.

03:33.621 --> 03:37.455
-You should wind down.
-I'm getting something out of it.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.722
You won't believe
what happened last night.

03:42.930 --> 03:46.093
You worked on your presentation?
Not at all?

03:46.300 --> 03:48.700
I had drinks at The Blue Dragon--

03:48.936 --> 03:51.871
Don't tell me one of your sex stories.

03:52.106 --> 03:57.169
-Bringing the embalmer tonight?
-She's not an embalmer. She does hair.

03:57.411 --> 04:02.644
-No. I have a date with a gorgeous--
-In the parking lot of the club...

04:02.850 --> 04:06.377
...I see this woman,
maybe 35, kind of classy.

04:06.654 --> 04:11.751
I figure she's waiting for her car.
So, what the hell, I talk to her.

04:12.126 --> 04:17.358
Turns out, she came in a limo. I say,
''I've never been in a limo before.''

04:17.565 --> 04:21.968
She stares at me for 30 seconds,
then says, ''Let's take a ride.''

04:22.170 --> 04:27.608
In the limo, she pushes a button and
a wall's up between us and the driver.

04:27.809 --> 04:31.267
She hits another button,
a sunroof opens.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.141
Bar slides open.

04:34.348 --> 04:38.148
She pours us vodka,
plays Sly and the Family Stone.

04:38.352 --> 04:41.480
Next thing I know, we slide onto PCH.

04:45.193 --> 04:48.959
Full moon, 2:00 a.m,
vodka, limo, music.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.994
And I'm thinking....

04:51.666 --> 04:54.430
-I don't believe you.
-We start to kiss.

04:54.669 --> 04:58.935
I slide my hand up her dress.
What do I find? Garter belt!

04:59.140 --> 05:03.474
-All your women wear garter belts!
-So I tell her I want her...

05:03.678 --> 05:08.411
...from behind, standing up,
with my head sticking out the sunroof.

05:08.616 --> 05:10.140
So we start doing it.

05:10.351 --> 05:14.378
We're going 60, my head's out
the roof, my hair's flying....

05:14.622 --> 05:19.559
This didn't happen. There was
no limo, no woman, no sunroof--

05:21.829 --> 05:23.296
That's disgusting.

05:23.497 --> 05:28.525
I'm ashamed to know you. How do you
get women to do these things?

05:29.103 --> 05:34.234
As you know by now, Yakamoto has
agreed to entrust the management...

05:34.442 --> 05:38.435
...of all his personal
and corporate assets to us.

05:38.646 --> 05:42.082
No small thanks
to the efforts of Harry Gruen.

05:43.284 --> 05:46.276
I'm sure Mr. Yakamoto's
confidence in us...

05:46.487 --> 05:51.117
...will increase with the lethal charm
you'll all exude tonight.

05:51.359 --> 05:53.327
A word of caution.

05:53.661 --> 05:57.654
He's very traditional.
Old-fashioned ideas about women.

05:57.865 --> 06:00.231
Wives must follow certain rules.

06:00.434 --> 06:05.872
Can't speak until spoken to, don't sit
until he does, all that crap.

06:07.275 --> 06:09.004
Meanwhile...

06:09.277 --> 06:13.179
...he keeps a stable of concubines
you wouldn't believe.

06:17.718 --> 06:19.015
Anyway...

06:20.454 --> 06:23.389
...this is a very old-world guy.

06:23.591 --> 06:28.756
So watch yourselves, and keep
your wives away from the mai tais.

06:28.963 --> 06:32.922
Okay, a few facts
about the man. Denny...

06:33.134 --> 06:36.297
...show us Yakamoto's
holdings for '85.

06:38.205 --> 06:42.938
Damn. Spreadsheets are still printing.
Machine's been down.

06:44.245 --> 06:47.703
Okay, forget it.
Walter, let's have your report.

07:00.161 --> 07:05.292
Yakamoto Worldwide has shown almost
recession-proof capabilities.

07:05.499 --> 07:09.162
Even in a disastrous third quarter...

07:10.071 --> 07:12.062
...his fish oil conglomerate...

07:12.306 --> 07:16.174
...bolstered his net worth
by some 27%.

07:23.484 --> 07:27.614
Walter, you look like shit.
Where were you last night?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.289
I was here until 3.

07:29.490 --> 07:33.290
This is the money business.
Image is everything.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.463
Look at you. This jacket is shit.

07:36.664 --> 07:41.624
See, men like Yakamoto don't make
deals with the lint man, here.

07:41.836 --> 07:45.670
-Now look at Denny. That's a suit.
-Armani, sir.

07:45.873 --> 07:48.364
-Take a few tips from him.
-Yes, sir.

07:48.609 --> 07:53.103
We'll make a good assistant
portfolio assessor out of you yet.

07:53.314 --> 07:54.975
See you at dinner.

07:56.484 --> 07:59.112
-Who's he bringing?
-I don't know, sir.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.016
God, I hope it's not the embalmer.

08:21.976 --> 08:24.376
-Can I borrow your wife?
-Sure. $50.

08:24.578 --> 08:27.411
I'm serious.
Denise bagged out on me.

08:27.648 --> 08:31.607
I need a date. They don't know
Susie's my sister-in-law.

08:31.819 --> 08:35.152
She'd do it, but it's our anniversary.

08:35.356 --> 08:37.688
-Going to Spago's.
-I'm ruined.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.986
Watch this. This guy 'll make an offer.

08:41.195 --> 08:44.653
-Have you decided?
-I can't go higher than 15,500.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.197
No can do. It's 17,000 list.

08:47.401 --> 08:50.097
What? You told me it was 18,000 list!

08:50.371 --> 08:55.502
You made $1 000 off your brother? I'm
bankrolling your dinner at Spago's!

08:55.743 --> 08:57.870
Stop it. You're scaring him.

08:58.079 --> 09:02.573
You're scaring me. Jesus, you'd
cheat your own flesh and blood.

09:02.783 --> 09:04.375
We'll talk.

09:06.253 --> 09:09.745
-I'll make it up to you.
-You'll write me a check?

09:09.957 --> 09:12.187
No, but I know this fantastic--

09:12.426 --> 09:16.760
Stop! You're gonna recommend
one of your psychotic friends.

09:16.964 --> 09:19.023
I resent that, Walter.

09:19.233 --> 09:24.535
You've set me up before, only you
forget to mention one crucial detail:

09:24.738 --> 09:29.072
She's a dopehead, a lesbian,
keeps dead cats in the freezer....

09:29.276 --> 09:33.303
What a New Year's!
''The champagne's in the icebox.''

09:33.547 --> 09:38.450
I'm sorry. Seriously, I know someone.
Nadia Gates, Susie's cousin.

09:38.652 --> 09:43.214
-Ted, I don't want to hear it.
-Don't you trust your own brother?

09:43.457 --> 09:47.393
No argument there.
But, no bullshit, Nadia's amazing.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.755
She's just moved back to town...

09:49.964 --> 09:53.058
-...and wants to meet people!
-What's she like?

09:53.267 --> 09:57.499
She's a sweetheart, good sense
of humour. You'll love her!

09:57.738 --> 10:01.504
I won't love her
because this won't happen!

10:01.742 --> 10:05.143
Suit yourself.
But I highly recommend her.

10:05.346 --> 10:07.576
Talk about the kiss of death!

10:10.284 --> 10:14.846
-Call us if you change your mind.
-I won't!

10:20.461 --> 10:23.021
Hi. Is Chloe there?

10:23.998 --> 10:26.831
Do you have the rifle range's number?

10:27.034 --> 10:31.971
Never mind. Look, I'll just
call her later. Thanks.

10:53.227 --> 10:55.695
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Is she reasonably pretty?

10:56.897 --> 10:59.957
''Reasonably'' doesn't begin
to describe it.

11:00.167 --> 11:04.968
I'm looking at her picture now.
She's an honest-to-God knockout.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.869
Ted, just this once, please.
The truth.

11:09.376 --> 11:12.903
Susie, tell Walter Nadia's pretty.

11:13.180 --> 11:15.410
She's very pretty, Walter.

11:18.586 --> 11:21.646
-When was the picture taken?
<i>-Four years ago.</i>

11:21.889 --> 11:25.985
Four years? She could've been
disfigured in four years!

11:26.193 --> 11:30.425
-She could've gained 100 pounds!
-She's gorgeous! Stop it!

11:30.664 --> 11:32.256
I almost forgot!

11:32.499 --> 11:36.026
Don't get her drunk.
She loses control completely.

11:36.670 --> 11:39.605
But don't get her drunk. If you do...

11:39.840 --> 11:42.741
...she loses control!

11:43.210 --> 11:46.737
Loses her inhibitions,
or she pees on the floor?

11:47.348 --> 11:49.373
What's ''lose control'' mean?

11:49.583 --> 11:52.552
Oh, you know, she gets real wild.

11:53.454 --> 11:56.855
She gets real wild!

12:02.062 --> 12:06.863
All right! I may kill you later,
but I'm doing this now...

12:07.067 --> 12:09.160
...before I change my mind.
Give me the number.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.750
-Walter?
-Yeah.

12:27.888 --> 12:29.412
Come on in.

12:37.331 --> 12:39.390
I'll just be a minute.

12:43.437 --> 12:47.339
I hope you don't mind
helping me with my suitcase.

12:47.574 --> 12:51.670
I'm moving out of here.
I'll be staying with a friend.

12:53.013 --> 12:56.915
If you feel like it,
a friend's having an art exhibit.

12:57.117 --> 13:01.144
If we have time before dinner,
maybe we could go?

13:01.355 --> 13:03.346
Yeah, no problem.

13:03.757 --> 13:07.249
Well, here goes, Walter. Ready or not.

13:07.461 --> 13:11.488
Oh, damn it!
This has been going on all night.

13:12.032 --> 13:15.365
There may be some matches over there.

13:16.036 --> 13:17.970
Let me look.

13:18.639 --> 13:20.664
It may be over there.

13:21.675 --> 13:22.972
Here.

13:24.111 --> 13:28.946
Now this is a blind date.
Here's your chance to run for it.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.744
Your very last chance.

13:35.522 --> 13:37.752
You missed your chance.

13:44.498 --> 13:45.795
I'm glad.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.380
I had no idea.

14:09.289 --> 14:11.348
Do you know this artist?

14:12.393 --> 14:16.295
I've met him once.
He's Susie's friend.

14:16.530 --> 14:20.057
I mean, coming was her idea.
We can go.

14:20.501 --> 14:23.993
-I don't have any obligation to him.
-No, come on.

14:24.204 --> 14:26.365
We're both adults, aren't we?

14:27.141 --> 14:29.302
I thought I was.

14:30.177 --> 14:33.010
I don't know. Maybe I'm not now.

14:35.682 --> 14:37.741
Can I ask you something?

14:39.820 --> 14:41.754
Yeah, I guess so.

14:42.823 --> 14:47.988
Why didn't you have a date tonight?
Is there something I should know?

14:48.195 --> 14:52.996
I can't imagine why you don't
have a date every night of the week.

14:53.233 --> 14:56.600
Know what? I was thinking
the same about you.

14:56.837 --> 15:01.171
-Come on, I'm serious.
-Me too. I was thinking that.

15:03.544 --> 15:05.739
I asked you first.

15:10.717 --> 15:13.743
I stopped dating
about three months ago.

15:14.021 --> 15:16.751
I was involved,
but it didn't work out.

15:16.957 --> 15:22.224
Boy, how it didn't work out. So I was
living in Baton Rouge with my mama.

15:22.596 --> 15:26.794
And you're my first date.
But you almost weren't.

15:27.067 --> 15:29.297
Susie talked me into it...

15:30.070 --> 15:32.038
...I'm glad to say.

15:33.207 --> 15:34.970
So how about you?

15:36.643 --> 15:40.773
Well, my date backed out
at the last minute...

15:41.215 --> 15:43.308
...I'm glad to say.

15:49.223 --> 15:51.214
You want some candy?

15:52.292 --> 15:54.783
I'm not much of a candy person.

15:55.762 --> 15:59.163
That's good.
I always was a candy person.

15:59.433 --> 16:03.733
Some people drink,
some people do drugs. I do sugar.

16:07.307 --> 16:09.571
This looks Japanese.

16:11.445 --> 16:14.141
''Master and Concubines''?

16:15.516 --> 16:17.484
It's Yakamoto.

16:17.751 --> 16:20.948
-What is?
-The big business dinner tonight...

16:21.154 --> 16:25.056
...is for this Japanese industrialist
new client of ours.

16:25.259 --> 16:29.127
He's old-world Japanese.
His wife's like his slave...

16:29.329 --> 16:31.320
...and he keeps concubines.

16:31.532 --> 16:35.263
-You're kidding.
-No. His wife knows all about it.

16:35.502 --> 16:37.936
It's traditional or something.

16:39.973 --> 16:43.636
Tell me something.
Are you into those traditions?

16:43.844 --> 16:49.009
No, I'm actually a
one-concubine kind of guy...

16:49.683 --> 16:51.207
-...actually.
-Good.

16:52.286 --> 16:56.689
So, what was it that made you
break up with this guy?

16:56.890 --> 17:00.018
-What do you mean?
-What was he like?

17:00.227 --> 17:02.661
-Psychopath. Like that guy over there.
-What's wrong?

17:04.464 --> 17:08.366
That's him! That's my psychotic
ex-boyfriend David.

17:08.868 --> 17:11.736
There. The guy in the goofy bow tie.

17:12.005 --> 17:13.632
He looks okay to me.

17:13.839 --> 17:17.674
He's been chasing me
for three months. I moved twice.

17:17.944 --> 17:22.608
I think he's coming over here!
Watch it. Please just hide.

17:22.816 --> 17:24.374
Just relax.

17:28.789 --> 17:30.347
Hello, Nadia.

17:30.557 --> 17:34.493
-David, don't start anything.
-I just want to say hello.

17:34.728 --> 17:36.320
Hi, I'm David.

17:36.530 --> 17:39.693
-Walter.
-She has every reason to be upset.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.666
I was so in love,
I made a total asshole of myself.

17:43.870 --> 17:46.896
Apology accepted.
Nice to meet you.

17:47.140 --> 17:50.632
-How long you been dating?
-None of your business!

17:50.877 --> 17:55.246
It is my business.
There's not a night that's gone by--

17:55.515 --> 17:58.814
You son of a bitch,
are you drilling her?!

17:59.019 --> 18:01.510
Shut up and leave her alone!

18:03.190 --> 18:06.421
Wait, I want to talk to you.
I'll find you!

18:12.899 --> 18:16.335
-I have an idea.
-Yeah? What?

18:20.941 --> 18:22.841
Thank you.

18:34.354 --> 18:38.256
-Okay, Walter, what's going on?
-Well....

18:38.625 --> 18:41.753
We have about half an hour.
Indulge me.

19:13.460 --> 19:17.226
-You like guitar?
-Oh, yeah, I do.

19:18.732 --> 19:22.725
<i>-We're set. How's the level for you?</i>
-It's basically cool.

19:22.936 --> 19:27.134
Turn up the monitors a bit
and we'll be there. Thanks.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.400
-How are you?
-Good, Stanley. How are you?

19:30.977 --> 19:33.138
Did you bring your guitar?

19:34.748 --> 19:38.013
No, I brought something better
than a guitar.

19:39.319 --> 19:41.583
-How you doing?
-Hi, how are you?

19:41.822 --> 19:43.551
Good, good.

19:45.525 --> 19:49.188
You ever hear him play?
He's really fantastic.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.992
Relax...

19:54.501 --> 19:56.901
...sip a little champagne.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.935
I don't think I should drink.

20:03.043 --> 20:05.910
The last three or four times I ...

20:06.113 --> 20:09.605
I mean, it sort of makes me go crazy!

20:12.018 --> 20:16.717
Well, one little glass
isn't gonna make you go crazy.

20:22.963 --> 20:25.261
This is our first toast.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.432
To auspicious beginnings.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.203
It's really good.

20:37.410 --> 20:41.107
<i>Stanley Jordan, take two. Rolling.</i>

20:59.266 --> 21:02.429
So, what made you think
to stop by here?

21:04.304 --> 21:09.071
I recorded here when I thought
I wanted to be a musician.

21:10.010 --> 21:14.242
I played guitar. But I really
don't have time for it now.

21:15.515 --> 21:20.976
I played all the time. I went to
the bathroom carrying a Stratocaster.

21:21.188 --> 21:24.919
I drove my mom nuts.
I got tendinitis.

21:27.961 --> 21:29.929
Why did you give it up?

21:30.997 --> 21:32.464
Well....

21:34.601 --> 21:37.934
Because if you want
to be a musician...

21:38.138 --> 21:43.132
...you're guaranteeing yourself
a life of poverty and obscurity...

21:43.343 --> 21:46.176
...unless you're talented
like Stanley.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.472
And...

21:49.516 --> 21:51.507
...I got a good job now...

21:51.818 --> 21:55.811
...good car. Next year,
I'll be able to get a condo.

21:57.824 --> 21:59.155
I don't know.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.987
It just kind of made sense.

22:05.265 --> 22:08.462
We're gonna be late.
Let me give you a little--

22:14.808 --> 22:17.208
Oh, I'm getting bad.

22:17.777 --> 22:20.769
I'm starting to feel the champagne.

22:24.184 --> 22:25.947
That's okay.

22:26.152 --> 22:27.881
Feel away.

22:28.321 --> 22:29.481
Come on.

23:10.697 --> 23:14.155
Hi, I called for Davis,
for two, please.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.336
-Joseph, table six.
-Follow me, please.

23:18.538 --> 23:23.373
Please don't touch the flowers.
The arrangement is very expensive.

23:23.576 --> 23:27.910
These things don't smell.
They're no good anyway.

23:29.683 --> 23:32.948
-Sorry. Oh, my God.
-It's all right.

23:33.219 --> 23:35.414
-You sure?
-It 'll be fine.

23:47.901 --> 23:50.301
-Lovely-looking girl.
-Thank you.

23:50.537 --> 23:52.562
-You know my wife.
-Yes, hello.

23:52.772 --> 23:55.468
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Gruen.

24:01.147 --> 24:05.709
Thank you. Do you think you could
find me some safety pins?

24:05.952 --> 24:07.783
Safety pins?

24:07.988 --> 24:10.252
No, I don't think so.

24:11.224 --> 24:13.749
There's a lot of roast beef in here.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.623
Would you care for a cocktail?

24:17.831 --> 24:22.325
-A bottle of your finest champagne.
-Very good.

24:22.602 --> 24:24.001
Thank you.

24:26.573 --> 24:28.404
Oh, my God.

24:29.943 --> 24:31.171
That's Yakamoto.

24:34.147 --> 24:35.671
Good evening.

24:36.249 --> 24:40.185
-My wife.
-Very nice to meet you, Mr. Yakimoto.

24:40.420 --> 24:42.354
Yakamoto.

24:44.591 --> 24:46.582
Mrs. Yakamoto.

24:47.127 --> 24:49.994
-How lovely you look.
-Thank you.

24:51.297 --> 24:55.666
That's incredible.
She's like a geisha girl.

25:11.951 --> 25:16.820
Cupcake, would you excuse me
for just a minute?

25:17.690 --> 25:19.282
Business.

25:24.130 --> 25:27.031
-They still do that in Japan?
-I don't know--

25:27.300 --> 25:30.531
Walter, you old dog.

25:31.538 --> 25:35.201
-Denny Gordon, this is Nadia Gates.
-How do you do?

25:35.475 --> 25:39.343
-Hi.
-I gotta hand it to you.

25:39.546 --> 25:43.573
This is the most exciting
woman in the place.

25:43.817 --> 25:46.945
Thank you. Nice tie.
Where did you get it?

25:47.153 --> 25:51.817
I don't remember. Probably
one of those places over on Rodeo.

25:52.058 --> 25:55.994
-Where's that?
-You don't know where Rodeo is?

25:56.196 --> 25:59.927
No, I know where it is.
I just wondered if you did.

26:03.169 --> 26:05.603
What happened to your pocket?

26:05.905 --> 26:09.534
-Oh, we had a little--
-That's the new style.

26:12.078 --> 26:14.546
See? Oh, that looks nice.

26:15.782 --> 26:20.583
-Aren't you forgetting your date?
-My date? Oh, right. Yes.

26:20.753 --> 26:24.553
I do hope that we'll meet again.

26:26.826 --> 26:30.227
''Denny Gordon, supervisor,
real estate analysis.''

26:30.430 --> 26:33.866
How did you get that?
It fell out of my pocket.

26:34.067 --> 26:37.935
-You pressed it in my hand.
-I don't think I did that.

26:38.171 --> 26:40.833
-You put it right in my hand.
-You see--

26:41.040 --> 26:46.273
-Why? Did you think I'd call you up?
-Come on, you know how it is.

26:46.513 --> 26:49.175
No, I don't think
he does know how it is.

26:49.449 --> 26:54.352
He's not a vain slimeball pig
that's led around by his dick.

26:58.191 --> 27:01.422
I guess that just about
sums it up, huh?

27:03.763 --> 27:05.788
AlI's fair in love and....

27:06.065 --> 27:10.024
She's right. You really are
a slimeball pig.

27:10.236 --> 27:14.104
Hey, Denny! Your ex-fiancée,
she just took a hike.

27:14.307 --> 27:15.638
Oh, jeez.

27:16.743 --> 27:17.801
Honey?

27:18.077 --> 27:19.977
Sweetheart!

27:20.246 --> 27:23.306
I'll be right back, sir.
You look lovely.

27:23.550 --> 27:24.744
Thank you.

27:24.951 --> 27:26.043
Pumpkin?

27:32.992 --> 27:36.894
-My boss, Mr. Gruen, is watching us.
-Where is he?

27:45.471 --> 27:48.804
-Boy, that was--
-You shouldn't have any more.

27:50.743 --> 27:53.143
-Are you ready?
-Yes, we are.

27:54.180 --> 27:57.513
Will you order for me, please?

28:00.520 --> 28:03.978
We'll start with
the ''etoo-vee-ay de vee-o a''--

28:09.495 --> 28:11.292
Which soup?

28:12.432 --> 28:16.095
We'll have the cream
''du con-cum-be-ray.''

28:18.171 --> 28:20.105
Vegetable?

28:23.543 --> 28:25.670
This one right here.

28:26.145 --> 28:28.272
The <i>gratín dauphinois</i> ?

28:28.781 --> 28:33.275
A bit of a clash with the
<i>veau au vin rouge,</i> don't you think?

28:33.486 --> 28:36.978
Excuse me. Come here.
Can I ask you something?

28:38.324 --> 28:43.023
Do you really speak French
or just bullshit menu French?

28:43.496 --> 28:46.260
-I trained in Paris.
-Oh, good.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.201
What did you say?

28:53.439 --> 28:57.808
I told him to stick a skewer
up his ass and flambé himself.

28:58.011 --> 29:00.605
-What did he say?
-He called me a slut.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.440
Now, just a goddamn minute here.

29:04.851 --> 29:06.113
What did he say?

29:06.352 --> 29:09.913
''Your taste in women
is as bad as your French.''

29:10.189 --> 29:12.623
How do you say, ''Step outside''?

29:17.063 --> 29:18.462
This is a....

29:20.600 --> 29:22.625
Excuse me.

29:23.069 --> 29:26.232
I said, ''The champagne
tastes like horse piss.''

29:26.439 --> 29:30.432
He said, ''I should know,''
which is quite a good comeback.

29:30.643 --> 29:33.703
-What the hell--?
-Oh, my God!

29:34.147 --> 29:36.411
-I'm sorry.
-What did he say?

29:36.616 --> 29:39.312
I don't know. I don't speak French.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.789
-He insulted my date.
-It's all Henri's fault. He's French.

29:42.789 --> 29:44.950
-He insulted my date.
-It's all Henri's fault. He's French.

29:46.793 --> 29:48.385
Hey, Mr. Y.

29:48.661 --> 29:52.290
If you don't mind,
that is the loveliest necklace.

29:52.498 --> 29:55.331
It's so pretty. Where did you get it?

29:55.535 --> 29:57.400
I don't speak English.

29:57.603 --> 30:00.003
He insulted my date, Nadia!

30:01.140 --> 30:03.768
-Oh, my God.
-Go back to your seat.

30:04.010 --> 30:06.638
-She can't talk?
-They're our guests.

30:06.846 --> 30:11.215
-I just asked about the necklace.
-You are foolish and silly.

30:11.451 --> 30:14.943
-Leaving so soon? Sit.
-Go jump on your concubine.

30:15.154 --> 30:18.021
Did you hear her?
I have no concubine.

30:18.291 --> 30:21.692
Walter, get this woman out of here!

30:23.396 --> 30:25.864
No, no. Don't do that.

30:27.066 --> 30:30.365
Why don't you walk
over there, Nadia? Here.

30:30.636 --> 30:32.331
Oh, take it to her.

30:33.139 --> 30:37.132
I hope this doesn't undermine
your confidence in us.

30:45.551 --> 30:48.748
-I worked very hard for this job.
-We can sort--

30:49.021 --> 30:51.819
-What's going on out here?
-Oh, my God.

30:52.024 --> 30:55.858
-Please, come back to the restaurant.
-Mrs. Gruen, hi.

30:56.596 --> 30:58.154
Mrs. Yakamoto.

30:58.398 --> 31:02.095
-She doesn't speak English.
-Just get out of here!

31:02.368 --> 31:05.030
Mrs. Yakamoto, I have your hair.

31:05.238 --> 31:09.265
I'm going to just
slip it under the door.

31:09.509 --> 31:10.874
Got it?

31:11.110 --> 31:15.012
I'll tell your husband
you'll be out in a minute.

31:17.717 --> 31:21.084
Don't take that
concubine stuff from anybody.

31:21.287 --> 31:24.586
-I no speak English!
-You a California resident?

31:24.791 --> 31:27.988
-I no speak English!
-Know what you're entitled?

31:28.194 --> 31:29.957
I no speak English!

31:30.196 --> 31:35.600
California law states you're entitled
to 50% of your husband's assets.

31:38.638 --> 31:40.765
Fifty percent?

31:41.274 --> 31:44.971
Mr. Gruen, please. I'm very sorry.
I had no way--

31:45.211 --> 31:47.873
Walter, go away. Just go away.

31:48.080 --> 31:52.073
Bottle of Meyer-Fonné Barsac.
Hors d'oeuvres, on the house?

31:52.285 --> 31:57.382
Sir, I can't begin to tell you
how dreadfully sorry l--

31:57.824 --> 31:59.951
Attention! Attention, everybody!

32:01.928 --> 32:05.159
Mrs. Yakamoto needs
a good divorce lawyer now...

32:05.364 --> 32:09.164
...because Mr. Yakamoto
is worth over $100 million.

32:14.707 --> 32:17.073
-Miss.
-I'll kill her!

32:20.613 --> 32:22.103
Harry--

32:22.782 --> 32:24.647
Don't touch me. Please.

32:24.917 --> 32:27.112
Did you hurt yourself?

32:34.627 --> 32:37.152
Do I have to say the words?

32:37.430 --> 32:39.898
-I'm fired?
-Fired?

32:40.900 --> 32:43.892
I only wish we were in the Army...

32:44.103 --> 32:48.597
-...so I could have you shot.
-Yes, sir.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.503
Twice.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.980
That was so much fun!

32:58.451 --> 33:02.581
My face is numb.
What do you wanna do now?

33:03.322 --> 33:06.587
There's a party down the street.
Let's go!

33:06.826 --> 33:12.230
Are you insane? You destroyed my life
and now you want to go to a party?

33:12.498 --> 33:16.832
-You don't like me, do you?
-I've never hit a woman before, but--

33:17.036 --> 33:19.368
-Let's make up.
-That won't work.

33:19.572 --> 33:22.905
-Of course, it will.
-It won't! Now stop it!

33:23.209 --> 33:28.340
-Nadia, I'm driving the car!
-Let's do it! Let's do it right now!

33:28.581 --> 33:32.039
-We're on the freeway!
-Who cares?

33:33.686 --> 33:37.679
I'm driving 55 miles an hour, here!
Will you, for chri--

33:38.190 --> 33:39.555
Stop it!

33:48.134 --> 33:52.468
-Stop, please!
-You're frowning again.

33:52.705 --> 33:57.108
Stop it! For chrissakes,
there's a car behind us!

33:57.310 --> 33:59.073
Gotta do better than that.

33:59.378 --> 34:02.905
Someone's getting out of the car.
Sit over there.

34:03.149 --> 34:05.276
-David!
-What? This is--

34:05.484 --> 34:07.611
-Car trouble?
-You following us?

34:07.820 --> 34:10.914
-I'm worried about her.
-I'm taking her home.

34:11.123 --> 34:16.025
You let her drink? Son of a bitch,
don't you know she can't drink?

34:16.228 --> 34:19.629
-Nadia, get out of the car!
-Stay in the car.

34:19.899 --> 34:24.495
-Hey, that's a-- That's a $500 bra!
-I'm gonna kill you!

34:24.737 --> 34:28.833
You were gonna drill her.
I'll kill you!

34:29.074 --> 34:31.475
Can't we just talk about it?

34:32.244 --> 34:34.007
Honey, stay in the car.

34:34.246 --> 34:37.909
-I'll stay in the car.
-You don't love her like I do!

34:38.117 --> 34:41.348
-I believe you!
-He doesn't love you like I do!

34:41.587 --> 34:45.648
What are you doing?
Get out of my car! Hey!

34:51.197 --> 34:53.427
That son of a bitch!

34:54.634 --> 34:56.931
I'm gonna kill you too!

35:02.208 --> 35:04.039
Walter, what--

35:12.284 --> 35:15.515
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

35:16.022 --> 35:17.990
Damn bastard!

35:29.402 --> 35:34.305
Jesus, that guy's a maniac.
He was really trying to kill me.

35:34.740 --> 35:36.367
Why'd you break up?

35:36.575 --> 35:40.306
You must be the best match
since Bonnie and Clyde.

35:50.189 --> 35:52.180
Come on.

35:53.893 --> 35:55.087
I'm sorry.

35:56.829 --> 35:59.059
I really am. I...

36:00.099 --> 36:01.760
It was a cheap shot.

36:04.704 --> 36:09.198
-I wasn't crying about that.
-What are you crying about?

36:12.712 --> 36:17.206
I just saw David chasing you
around the car, and I got sad.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.211
Me too.

36:22.321 --> 36:24.448
Do you have a Kleenex?

36:27.193 --> 36:29.024
A handkerchief?

36:32.565 --> 36:33.827
Here.

36:35.367 --> 36:38.302
I hate it when my eyes get all puffy.

36:38.537 --> 36:42.166
I get all stuffed up. I look terrible.

36:44.677 --> 36:46.736
Are my eyes puffy?

36:50.382 --> 36:54.045
Can we stop so I can blow my nose
and wash my face?

36:54.253 --> 36:56.585
I gotta go to the bathroom.

36:56.822 --> 36:59.052
Yeah, sure. Okay.

37:00.993 --> 37:02.153
Thank you.

37:51.143 --> 37:54.203
-Can I help you?
-Fill it with unleaded.

37:54.413 --> 37:56.881
-Super?
-Regular.

37:58.584 --> 38:00.415
Let me say two words:

38:00.619 --> 38:04.453
Engine knocks. Rings and valves,
$900. Check, please.

38:04.657 --> 38:08.650
You can pay me now
or pay my service manager later.

38:08.894 --> 38:11.727
-Fill it with unleaded.
-Super?

38:11.931 --> 38:13.922
The guy wants super.

38:24.243 --> 38:26.143
-She's not in there.
-What?

38:26.345 --> 38:30.338
The girl who came with you?
She's at Freda & Freddie's.

38:30.816 --> 38:32.681
The disco.

39:01.447 --> 39:03.813
Where's the ladies' room?

39:04.850 --> 39:06.715
Thank you very much.

39:37.650 --> 39:40.312
I'm looking for my date.

39:40.519 --> 39:44.478
She's a brunette with a red dress on,
really pretty.

39:44.690 --> 39:49.525
And she came in
the bathroom here and, see--

39:49.728 --> 39:52.925
She was in the bathroom
at the gas station.

39:53.165 --> 39:57.226
She took a long time.
I went to get her and she was gone.

39:57.436 --> 40:00.496
And the gas station guy said...

40:03.008 --> 40:07.775
...that she came in here.
I figured she went into this--

40:08.681 --> 40:12.048
I'll wait right here
at the bar for her, okay?

40:12.251 --> 40:17.018
Bartender, can I get
a Perrier and a soda? I mean--

40:17.222 --> 40:20.191
A Scotch and soda.
Something like that.

40:20.392 --> 40:21.950
Can I buy you a drink?

40:22.227 --> 40:26.960
She had a thing with her ex,
and she got a little emotional.

40:27.199 --> 40:31.033
She started crying and wanted
to stop at a gas station.

40:31.236 --> 40:33.204
So we stopped next door.

40:33.439 --> 40:37.705
She took a long time.
When I went to get her, she'd left.

40:37.910 --> 40:42.870
The guy said she came here.
She probably went into this bathroom.

40:43.082 --> 40:48.486
It wasn't like I was trying to
look in. I was trying to find her.

40:48.821 --> 40:51.221
Come dance with me.

40:51.890 --> 40:55.951
-This is the girl. Right here.
-Five dollars, please.

41:00.733 --> 41:05.295
-I know you're a good dancer.
-No, I really don't wanna dance.

41:06.972 --> 41:10.669
-Stop, it's not funny.
-Come on.

41:10.976 --> 41:13.103
I'm sorry.

41:15.481 --> 41:17.449
Let's just go.

41:18.317 --> 41:21.480
Please. I'm sorry.

42:28.353 --> 42:30.878
All right, you ready for this?

42:40.933 --> 42:43.265
-Let's go now.
-Please, Walter.

43:14.399 --> 43:18.802
-Hi, I just wanted to come by and--
-David, don't--

43:19.037 --> 43:23.633
I came by to apologize.
I still love her very much.

43:23.842 --> 43:27.403
What? So you can drill her?
You son of a bitch!

43:39.725 --> 43:41.955
You bitch!

43:46.231 --> 43:48.358
We're leaving. Now!

43:52.905 --> 43:55.840
You son of a bitch!

44:04.316 --> 44:07.308
Let's go before the cops show up.

44:08.754 --> 44:10.813
Come on, come on!

44:12.324 --> 44:14.383
Move it, move it, move it.

44:16.995 --> 44:19.361
Get in. Get in!

44:20.332 --> 44:21.492
How much?

44:21.733 --> 44:23.826
-Cash or plastic?
-Cash!

44:24.036 --> 44:27.164
It's $17.50.
What's going on over there?

44:27.372 --> 44:30.432
I wanna talk to you.
Get out of the car.

44:30.676 --> 44:33.167
Just get out of the--

44:34.246 --> 44:37.704
Get back inside, you stupid idiot!

44:50.862 --> 44:55.265
Your ex's hobby is killing people.
What's his profession?

44:56.068 --> 45:00.630
-He's a defence lawyer.
-For who? Jack the Ripper?

45:00.872 --> 45:02.931
It's not funny.

45:04.109 --> 45:07.772
I'm taking you home.
Where do your friends live?

45:08.046 --> 45:12.745
They live on Elm and East Hill.

45:12.951 --> 45:16.387
Your friends live
on Elm and East Hill?

45:16.588 --> 45:18.579
No, the party.

45:19.558 --> 45:22.118
I'm not taking you to any party!

45:22.327 --> 45:23.988
Party!

45:25.831 --> 45:28.391
I'm gonna take you home.

45:28.734 --> 45:30.099
To Baton Rouge?

45:31.670 --> 45:35.936
I'm taking you to your friends' house.
Where do they live?

45:36.308 --> 45:40.836
-We have to get on the freeway.
-No! No more freeways.

45:41.580 --> 45:44.845
It's the only way I know
how to get there.

45:46.285 --> 45:51.154
-What's the exact address?
-I know the house.

45:56.662 --> 45:59.756
-I'm getting on the freeway.
-Where's the hole?

45:59.965 --> 46:02.695
But if you make one move--
You listening?

46:02.934 --> 46:05.960
If you make one move
that makes me nervous...

46:06.171 --> 46:10.130
...I'll put you out at the first
intersection. Understand?

46:10.542 --> 46:12.533
Don't frown, Walter.

46:13.879 --> 46:17.645
Here's the house. Right....

46:19.384 --> 46:22.842
Okay, here, stop. Right here.

46:31.163 --> 46:34.724
When was the last time
you saw these people?

46:34.933 --> 46:36.924
About six years.

46:37.436 --> 46:38.664
Listen to me.

46:38.904 --> 46:41.737
Listen. Listen to me.

46:42.174 --> 46:45.143
You absolutely sure this is the house?

46:45.344 --> 46:47.335
Absolutely.

46:49.448 --> 46:51.109
Jesus!

47:02.194 --> 47:07.632
Hey! Stop! Get out of there!
Come here a minute!

47:17.976 --> 47:19.876
Your beautiful car.

47:23.548 --> 47:27.951
Look at the bright side.
What the hell else could happen?

47:34.559 --> 47:38.154
-Nadia, just stay out of this.
-Shut up, bitch!

47:38.397 --> 47:39.887
Your wallet.

47:41.967 --> 47:45.801
-Oh, shit! The cops!
-Drop the gun!

47:51.343 --> 47:53.311
There was three girls.

47:53.512 --> 47:58.347
One of the girls put a gun to my head!
She had a knife in my crotch!

47:58.617 --> 48:01.313
Get out of the freaking car!

48:01.620 --> 48:04.589
One had red hair standing straight up.

48:04.790 --> 48:08.624
Both had leather jackets,
and one had a big tattoo!

48:11.763 --> 48:14.459
How much did you drink tonight, sir?

48:38.023 --> 48:39.320
Good.

48:39.791 --> 48:41.383
Head back.

48:41.860 --> 48:43.691
Eyes closed.

48:43.895 --> 48:45.795
Arms out.

48:45.997 --> 48:47.794
Palms up.

48:47.999 --> 48:51.491
With your left hand,
touch the tip of your nose.

48:52.070 --> 48:53.298
Good.

48:53.505 --> 48:55.530
Now the other hand.

48:57.742 --> 49:00.404
Now, keep your eyes closed.

49:00.645 --> 49:04.513
Raise your right foot
eight inches for 10 seconds.

49:16.127 --> 49:18.994
God, I feel horrible.

49:19.631 --> 49:22.293
Dare I hope that you sobered up?

49:22.834 --> 49:25.325
Oh, I drank. I drank so much.

49:26.505 --> 49:28.405
Yes, you did.

49:30.275 --> 49:34.177
And the dinner party.... Oh, God.

49:34.412 --> 49:37.347
-Walter, I'm so sorry.
-Well...

49:37.816 --> 49:40.444
...I know I feel a lot better now.

49:44.990 --> 49:48.619
I just have this chemical imbalance.

49:48.827 --> 49:54.129
It's like an allergy to alcohol.
It makes me crazy, that's all.

49:54.966 --> 49:56.263
Is that so?

49:58.336 --> 50:03.433
Look, Walter, I know you hate me.
So just listen.

50:04.109 --> 50:07.135
Take me to my friend Cathy's house.

50:07.679 --> 50:12.207
I know the address.
I won't ever bother you again.

50:17.022 --> 50:19.013
I'll kill you!

50:19.257 --> 50:20.519
Great!

50:20.725 --> 50:24.252
-I thought we'd lost him!
-What fun would that be?

50:25.997 --> 50:27.760
-David!
-Hold the tray!

50:37.876 --> 50:42.108
You son of a bitch! You wanna play?
Fine, I'll kill you!

50:53.625 --> 50:57.721
Actually, if you'll just
drop me off at the nearest hotel--

50:57.929 --> 51:02.696
-And end this glorious evening?
-I told you I was sorry.

51:02.901 --> 51:06.632
It's barely midnight.
Don't you wanna boogie down?

51:07.105 --> 51:10.404
Dance all night? Tear up the town?

51:10.942 --> 51:14.241
I just wanna lie down
in a nice, cool place.

51:14.446 --> 51:17.472
I just remembered! There's a party!

51:17.716 --> 51:21.812
I know somebody mentioned
a party at Elm and East Hill.

51:22.053 --> 51:25.022
I don't wanna go to a party anymore.

51:25.557 --> 51:29.653
My friends are nice, quiet people.
They'll bore you.

51:29.861 --> 51:33.160
We'll just have to
liven them up, won't we?

51:42.407 --> 51:44.500
Seen some traffic, pal?

51:46.611 --> 51:49.341
-Walter, listen to me.
-What?

51:49.581 --> 51:51.572
Party pooper.

51:55.720 --> 51:58.280
-Please, Walter.
-This is great.

52:03.461 --> 52:06.794
-How are you?
-Walter Davis, rocket scientist.

52:08.466 --> 52:10.127
I'm thirsty.

52:10.368 --> 52:11.801
Thank you.

52:12.103 --> 52:14.537
Walter Davis, gynaecologist.

52:17.242 --> 52:21.201
-I know these people.
-Great! Let's mingle.

52:34.959 --> 52:37.086
You can't juggle pâté.

52:37.662 --> 52:38.788
Oh, my God!

52:38.997 --> 52:42.933
-You came after all.
-Walter Davis, interior decorator.

52:43.134 --> 52:48.162
-Did you do the Leland house?
-We did the upstairs in '60s kitsch.

52:48.406 --> 52:52.900
-Beanbag chairs, lava lamps. Amazing.
-We have to go there now.

52:53.111 --> 52:55.409
That's a great suit, Grant.

53:04.322 --> 53:07.917
106 at the Forum,
24 seconds left in the game.

53:08.159 --> 53:11.651
Lakers down by one.
Magic pumps, shoots.

53:12.997 --> 53:15.864
Lakers win in overtime, folks!

53:16.067 --> 53:17.694
Boston fans?

53:17.902 --> 53:20.268
Do I hear a mambo?

53:20.572 --> 53:21.903
Come on, Nadia.

53:25.009 --> 53:27.569
It's mambo time!

53:30.515 --> 53:32.574
Listen to me!

53:37.255 --> 53:40.088
Come and dance with me, darling.

53:49.267 --> 53:51.758
Walter Davis, brain surgeon.

53:52.637 --> 53:55.538
Walter Davis, mambo king!

53:57.776 --> 54:01.644
-Mambo with me, darling!
-Would you care for another--

54:04.949 --> 54:08.441
I hope Walter and Nadia
are having a good time.

54:14.125 --> 54:18.084
You lie down in a quiet room,
and I'll call a cab.

54:18.296 --> 54:22.630
What is all this? I thought
you were Ms. Party-All-Night.

54:22.834 --> 54:25.325
This is a great fucking party!

54:27.505 --> 54:29.939
You'll thank me in the morning.

54:34.078 --> 54:35.875
Let's do it.

54:36.414 --> 54:41.249
Let's do it in the coats!
Right here in the fur coats, honey.

54:41.786 --> 54:46.587
Why don't you do now what you're
going to do later anyway?

54:46.925 --> 54:48.449
Just pass out.

54:48.927 --> 54:51.361
Come to me, baby!

54:59.704 --> 55:04.368
Nadia, my little minx.
You've come back to me.

55:04.642 --> 55:07.975
You can't get rid of me that easily.

55:10.315 --> 55:12.374
I'm gonna rip your head off!

55:18.489 --> 55:22.755
So I take her to my house,
watch a movie, kicking back.

55:23.061 --> 55:25.052
She's about this tall.

55:25.263 --> 55:27.356
Sort of like that one.

55:31.069 --> 55:32.161
Can I help you?

55:32.370 --> 55:35.897
I need my suitcase out of here.
I called a cab.

55:42.847 --> 55:46.544
-I wanna talk to you!
-Hey, go call somebody.

55:46.751 --> 55:49.242
I'm gonna freaking kill you!

55:52.790 --> 55:54.257
Get up, you big--

55:57.228 --> 55:58.855
Call them!

56:08.606 --> 56:10.267
-Walter, no!
-Shut up!

56:10.475 --> 56:12.306
-I'm not worth it.
-Shut up!

56:12.644 --> 56:13.838
-Dance!
-What?

56:14.045 --> 56:15.706
I said dance, scumbag!

56:21.219 --> 56:22.208
Moonwalk!

56:27.325 --> 56:28.815
I hate that shit!

56:31.396 --> 56:33.364
He's got a gun!

56:47.245 --> 56:49.440
Step up to the line, sir.

56:54.719 --> 56:56.186
Hands over your head.

56:56.754 --> 56:59.416
Straighten up. Look straight ahead.

57:08.433 --> 57:12.563
Here. You're allowed two phone calls.

57:21.946 --> 57:26.406
My brother was just
in a serious accident. I ...

57:26.617 --> 57:30.917
-What do you drive? I have a car--
-Have a nice day.

57:48.639 --> 57:52.405
Buckle up, Walter.
You're in enough trouble.

57:53.244 --> 57:55.144
It's the law!

57:58.950 --> 58:00.315
Home?

58:02.420 --> 58:05.947
I warned you not to let her drink.

58:08.593 --> 58:13.963
You'd better get a good lawyer
or you'll go to jail for a long time.

58:17.335 --> 58:20.168
You're lucky you didn't kill anybody.

58:26.611 --> 58:27.839
Bad hangover?

58:30.681 --> 58:32.842
Serves you right.

58:34.519 --> 58:36.180
New car?

58:41.859 --> 58:43.292
God!

58:51.869 --> 58:54.963
-Sorry about your car.
-Just get out.

59:00.144 --> 59:04.046
-Thanks for bailing me out.
-I didn't bail you out.

59:09.020 --> 59:13.684
-Teddy, what did you say?
-I said I didn't bail you out.

59:13.925 --> 59:16.155
-Well, who did?
-Nadia.

59:16.394 --> 59:18.919
What?! Wait a second!

59:30.041 --> 59:33.101
-You smashed my rear window!
-Where is she?

59:33.377 --> 59:38.371
-For chrissakes, she's staying with us!
-I want you to take me to her.

59:48.960 --> 59:52.191
-She didn't go to her friend's.
-Where is she?

59:52.396 --> 59:53.886
It's only 7:30!

59:54.098 --> 59:57.727
-I'm feeling sick again.
-She's in the guest room.

59:58.069 --> 01:00:00.799
-What is it?
-He wants to talk to Nadia.

01:00:01.038 --> 01:00:05.270
-But it's only 7:30.
-Look, Walter's out of control.

01:00:43.915 --> 01:00:45.678
Can you hear me?

01:00:46.484 --> 01:00:49.851
-Yes. Who are you?
-It's Walter.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:56.153
Walter, are you dead?
God, you look dead.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:59.261
How much do I owe you for my bail?

01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:05.100
I don't wanna be obligated
to you for anything.

01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:10.599
Tell me how much I owe you.
I'll go home and write you a check.

01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:14.868
-Can we discuss this later?
-I don't have much time.

01:01:15.513 --> 01:01:18.175
-Don't shout.
-I wasn't shouting.

01:01:18.382 --> 01:01:23.217
I know. I thought you were going to,
and I couldn't stand it.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.921
I go to court a week from this Friday.

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:36.725
After that, I'm told
I'll probably go to jail...

01:01:36.968 --> 01:01:38.697
...for at least two years.

01:01:38.903 --> 01:01:43.533
I'd rather kill myself
than have you visit me in jail.

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:46.141
So tell me how much I owe you...

01:01:46.344 --> 01:01:49.745
...and then I never
wanna see you again.

01:02:01.192 --> 01:02:04.355
Ten thousand dollars!

01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:12.232
Now get out of here,
you ungrateful monster.

01:02:12.436 --> 01:02:13.994
Ungrateful?

01:02:14.205 --> 01:02:16.196
I'm ungrateful?

01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:21.568
I should be grateful after
what you did to me last night?

01:02:21.779 --> 01:02:24.748
After what I did?
What did I do to you?

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:28.112
You did a lot of things,
to a lot of people.

01:02:28.352 --> 01:02:32.516
I just happened to be a part of it.
A big part, I recall.

01:02:32.723 --> 01:02:35.886
-You got me drunk.
-I didn't get you drunk.

01:02:36.093 --> 01:02:40.189
-You bought the champagne.
-You didn't have to drink it!

01:02:40.398 --> 01:02:44.391
That's a cheap shot, Walter.
A real cheap shot.

01:02:44.602 --> 01:02:48.470
I drank it because you
seemed sweet and generous.

01:02:48.706 --> 01:02:51.436
Somebody I could fall in love with.

01:02:54.278 --> 01:02:58.374
I thought you were special.
I really did.

01:02:58.582 --> 01:03:00.948
I'm sorry you got fired.

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:05.919
I'm sorry you got arrested.
But you know why I'm most sorry?

01:03:06.123 --> 01:03:08.853
I'm sorry that you're not so special.

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.154
That you're mean and self-pitying...

01:03:12.396 --> 01:03:15.888
...and that you don't give
a damn about how I feel.

01:03:16.133 --> 01:03:18.761
And I feel shitty, Walter!

01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:25.502
Oh, God.

01:03:34.452 --> 01:03:36.477
Where you going?

01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:40.457
Want me to drive--? You want a cab?

01:03:47.965 --> 01:03:49.489
You're right.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.500
Without a great lawyer,
he'll probably go to prison.

01:03:53.771 --> 01:03:56.706
He's planning on defending himself.

01:03:57.842 --> 01:04:00.276
He'll definitely go to prison.

01:04:03.981 --> 01:04:05.642
Will you defend him?

01:04:06.484 --> 01:04:08.213
Why would I do that?

01:04:09.019 --> 01:04:12.785
Because you're greatly responsible,
that's why.

01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:19.027
You do have a point.
I am greatly responsible.

01:04:19.964 --> 01:04:21.158
Not good enough.

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:26.726
If you do, I'll live with you.

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:31.371
Still not good enough.

01:04:32.543 --> 01:04:36.377
-Okay. Goodbye.
-I'll defend him on one condition.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.241
What's that?

01:04:39.683 --> 01:04:41.674
Marry me.

01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:48.157
I feel guilty about what I did
to Walter, but not that guilty.

01:04:48.359 --> 01:04:53.490
Possession of an illegal firearm.
Assault with intent to commit murder.

01:04:53.697 --> 01:04:56.257
Ten years, minimum.

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:15.980
-Yes, Lupa.
<i>-Miss Gates wishes to see you again.</i>

01:05:16.187 --> 01:05:18.747
-Have her wait.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

01:05:24.962 --> 01:05:27.226
You should know this up front.

01:05:27.798 --> 01:05:32.292
I don't like you anymore.
And I certainly don't love you.

01:05:32.703 --> 01:05:34.295
I don't blame you.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.737
Do we have to have sex?

01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:46.914
But no kissing.

01:05:51.388 --> 01:05:56.792
All rise. Court is now in session.
Judge Harold Bedford presiding.

01:05:57.595 --> 01:05:58.687
Be seated.

01:06:04.735 --> 01:06:06.396
Mr. Walter Davis.

01:06:10.774 --> 01:06:13.174
Thank you. Yes, Your Honour.

01:06:14.778 --> 01:06:18.578
I understand you refuse
to be represented by counsel.

01:06:18.782 --> 01:06:19.942
That's correct.

01:06:20.284 --> 01:06:24.277
Are you suicidal, Mr. Davis,
or just plain stupid?

01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:28.615
Probably a bit of both, sir.
Your Honour.

01:06:28.826 --> 01:06:30.259
I see.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:34.862
Mr. Davis, it would be a humongous
understatement to tell you...

01:06:35.132 --> 01:06:38.659
...how passionately I disapprove
of your actions.

01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:42.270
In fact, I'd be equally
critical of a physician...

01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:46.943
...planning to perform
brain surgery on himself.

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:51.178
-Yes, Your Honour.
-''Yes, Your Honour'' doesn't do it.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:55.113
Let the public defender
handle your case.

01:06:55.319 --> 01:06:59.119
-That won't be necessary, Your Honour.
-Oh, shit.

01:07:00.691 --> 01:07:06.129
-Sorry I'm late. I got it from here.
-Mr. Davis, would you explain this?

01:07:06.363 --> 01:07:09.025
I'll represent Mr. Davis, Your Honour.

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:13.829
I was speaking to Mr. Davis!
I was under the impression....

01:07:14.038 --> 01:07:18.168
-What are you doing?
-I'm doing this as a favour to Nadia.

01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:22.869
-Ensuring I go to the gas chamber?
-If you're not calm, I can't help.

01:07:23.147 --> 01:07:28.380
-Please don't let this man help me!
-Order in the court!

01:07:30.854 --> 01:07:34.722
One more outburst,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

01:07:36.026 --> 01:07:40.986
-You all right, Agnes?
-Yes, Your Honour, I'm all right.

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:46.828
Will counsel please
approach the bench?

01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:49.735
Hey! Your--

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.271
This is--

01:07:53.677 --> 01:07:55.406
What the hell's going on?

01:07:55.913 --> 01:07:59.940
Not complicated. I decided
he shouldn't defend himself.

01:08:00.184 --> 01:08:03.745
-Bullshit. What's on your face?
-I was in a fight.

01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:06.422
-With whom?
-Mr. Davis.

01:08:08.859 --> 01:08:11.555
-I don't want complications.
-Since when?

01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:13.930
I offer you a proposition.

01:08:14.131 --> 01:08:17.965
-If you find my defendant innocent--
-Stop.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:22.462
You're crazy, trying to bribe
a superior court judge.

01:08:22.706 --> 01:08:26.038
I'll stop practising law
in your jurisdiction.

01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:30.872
-I don't believe you.
-I swear on Mother's grave.

01:08:31.115 --> 01:08:35.176
-Your mom's playing golf at Bel Air.
-I meant future tense.

01:08:35.386 --> 01:08:40.790
-Go out of state. Say, Alaska?
-My heart's set on somewhere tropical.

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:45.051
-Change your name.
-Not practical. I'm getting married.

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:49.662
You could honeymoon for
five or six years. All expenses paid.

01:08:49.933 --> 01:08:53.630
-I don't think that would--
-I won't press my luck.

01:08:53.904 --> 01:08:56.497
-One more thing.
-I knew it.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:01.676
The wedding's at your house.
Invite all your influential friends.

01:09:01.912 --> 01:09:06.679
If I practice law in another state,
I want to drop some big names.

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:08.908
-Anything else?
-That's it.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:14.082
I'll be breaking the law for
the first time, but it's worth it.

01:09:15.459 --> 01:09:16.756
Thanks, Dad.

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:21.288
-Jesus.
-Sorry, Your Honour.

01:09:25.836 --> 01:09:28.100
What did you tell him? What?

01:09:28.305 --> 01:09:32.969
You can't railroad me into jail
so you can have a shot at Nadia!

01:09:33.176 --> 01:09:35.770
-Quiet!
-Don't believe him! He's crazy!

01:09:35.979 --> 01:09:38.640
-He's trying to steal my girl!
-Order!

01:09:38.849 --> 01:09:42.511
Order in the goddamn court!
Sorry, Agnes.

01:09:43.953 --> 01:09:47.856
I find the defendant not guilty.
Case dismissed.

01:09:48.325 --> 01:09:53.421
-Take a 20-minute recess.
-All rise. Twenty-minute recess.

01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:55.530
Congratulations.

01:09:56.133 --> 01:09:59.227
-What happened?
-You're a free man.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:04.037
-Now you can congratulate me.
-What for?

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:07.138
Nadia and I are getting married.

01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:10.911
And you're the one
who made it possible.

01:10:18.322 --> 01:10:21.416
-Where's Nadia?
-Baton Rouge, telling her mom.

01:10:21.658 --> 01:10:27.028
In the last few days my reality
has been tested to the limits, but--

01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:30.723
-Telling her mom what?
-She said to give you this.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:40.600
You are so lucky.
Why are you so unhappy?

01:10:40.844 --> 01:10:43.870
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna walk a while.

01:10:49.586 --> 01:10:51.577
<i>''Dearest Walter:</i>

01:10:52.389 --> 01:10:54.516
<i>You may not believe it...</i>

01:10:54.758 --> 01:10:58.159
<i>...but I am sorry</i>
<i>for the trouble I caused you.</i>

01:10:58.362 --> 01:11:02.458
<i>I hope someday you'll find it</i>
<i>in your heart to forgive me.</i>

01:11:02.699 --> 01:11:07.796
<i>You're a special person, Walter,</i>
<i>and I'll miss you a lot.</i>

01:11:08.038 --> 01:11:09.733
<i>Love, Nadia.</i>

01:11:10.374 --> 01:11:14.242
<i>Oh, P.S. I hope you start</i>
<i>playing the guitar again.''</i>

01:11:39.436 --> 01:11:41.597
<i>-Hello.</i>
<i>-Susie, it's Nadia.</i>

01:11:41.805 --> 01:11:46.105
<i>-Hi, where are you?</i>
<i>-Still in Baton Rouge. How's Walter?.</i>

01:11:47.578 --> 01:11:52.072
<i>He seemed pretty good</i>
<i>when I talked to him on the phone.</i>

01:11:52.282 --> 01:11:55.911
<i>He asked about you.</i>
<i>I told him you were...</i>

01:11:56.119 --> 01:12:00.146
<i>-...deliriously happy. Did I lie?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

01:12:00.357 --> 01:12:05.659
Oh, honey. Just get out of this thing.
You're just gonna ruin your life.

01:12:05.929 --> 01:12:09.763
<i>I can't. I know it sounds crazy,</i>
<i>but I made a deal.</i>

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.128
<i>Look, I'll call you</i>
<i>when I get in. Bye.</i>

01:12:13.337 --> 01:12:15.703
-Who's that?
-It's Nadia.

01:12:15.939 --> 01:12:17.497
How is she?

01:12:18.442 --> 01:12:20.842
She's deliriously happy.

01:12:37.628 --> 01:12:40.324
-What is it, darling?
-Air.

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:43.624
The air here's so wonderful.
I just love it.

01:12:54.645 --> 01:12:56.840
What, no merry-go-round?

01:12:57.047 --> 01:13:00.244
You promised David
a first-class wedding.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:05.085
-A wedding, not Disney World.
-Don't be a shitheel, Harold.

01:13:05.322 --> 01:13:08.553
Your only son doesn't
get married every day.

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:12.855
He's your son too.
It's time you take half the blame.

01:13:13.063 --> 01:13:17.159
-Mom! Dad!
-See? He even gives you top billing.

01:13:20.003 --> 01:13:23.200
Your soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

01:13:23.407 --> 01:13:24.999
-Hello.
-How do you do?

01:13:25.208 --> 01:13:29.042
-Well, let me show you to your room.
-Okay, fine.

01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:34.383
What do you think?

01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:37.849
She isn't at all
what I thought she'd be.

01:13:38.088 --> 01:13:40.249
What did you think she'd be?

01:13:40.457 --> 01:13:42.186
Blind.

01:13:48.131 --> 01:13:50.463
Plan to have children?
Naturally.

01:13:50.701 --> 01:13:54.432
-I know what to get you for a present.
-What's that?

01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:56.401
A vasectomy.

01:14:09.753 --> 01:14:14.247
The house is far too large
for us without David here...

01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:18.485
...but we're so emotionally attached.
We bought it in 1953...

01:14:18.729 --> 01:14:21.789
...the year after
Harold became a judge.

01:14:22.299 --> 01:14:25.325
-It's lovely.
-Thank you, my dear.

01:14:25.802 --> 01:14:28.896
Where are you and David
planning on living?

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:35.445
We haven't really decided yet.
I think David likes San Francisco.

01:14:37.114 --> 01:14:41.244
I thought you had in mind
something more tropical.

01:14:41.451 --> 01:14:46.616
We really haven't decided on
a place yet. Miami, maybe. Honolulu.

01:14:46.823 --> 01:14:50.987
-I understand you're from the South?
-Louisiana.

01:14:51.228 --> 01:14:56.131
I love the South. I played
the front nine at Augusta once.

01:14:56.566 --> 01:15:00.093
-Did you let Rambo out?
-Yes, sir.

01:15:05.842 --> 01:15:08.936
Jesus Christ.
Good doggie. Nice doggie.

01:15:09.446 --> 01:15:11.004
Oh, shit.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:17.043
She's lovely.

01:15:19.389 --> 01:15:21.016
And bright.

01:15:22.959 --> 01:15:25.951
To marry him,
she must have a screw loose.

01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:31.027
What is that dog barking about?

01:15:35.372 --> 01:15:36.464
Jordan.

01:15:55.492 --> 01:15:57.153
Rambo! Shut up!

01:15:57.594 --> 01:16:00.654
You'll wake up
the whole neighbourhood!

01:16:37.067 --> 01:16:38.728
-Rambo!
-Jordan!

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:41.301
-Yes, sir?
-What's with that dog?

01:16:41.538 --> 01:16:44.405
-I don't know, sir.
-Do something!

01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:48.801
Come here, Rambo.
What the hell's got into you?

01:16:50.714 --> 01:16:54.548
Stop that! You keep quiet
or I'll call the vet...

01:16:54.751 --> 01:16:59.711
...and he'll cut them off
and you'll bark like Cyndi Lauper.

01:17:02.092 --> 01:17:03.457
Help!

01:17:03.727 --> 01:17:05.820
Somebody open the door!

01:17:20.443 --> 01:17:21.910
Rambo, shut up!

01:17:22.112 --> 01:17:26.344
-Rambo, shut up!
-Jordan, shut up!

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:28.380
Come on, Rambo.

01:17:32.122 --> 01:17:34.920
I want you to be quiet, you hear me?

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:38.593
What the hell are you doing?

01:17:38.795 --> 01:17:41.730
Planting corn!
What the hell do you think?

01:17:51.808 --> 01:17:54.709
I can't stand him. He's an idiot.

01:17:54.978 --> 01:17:58.038
Let's go back to bed
and forget him, okay?

01:17:58.281 --> 01:18:01.114
Maybe if we think hard, he'll go away.

01:18:01.318 --> 01:18:04.287
If he leaves me this house,
I'll sell it.

01:18:04.588 --> 01:18:06.385
Tomorrow, yes.

01:18:10.794 --> 01:18:12.159
Good night.

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:15.093
Miserable mutt!

01:18:15.265 --> 01:18:17.893
-Would you like some hot cocoa?
-No.

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:22.300
Rambo can protect us
when the neighbours try to lynch us.

01:19:03.647 --> 01:19:05.877
I'm gonna kill that damn dog.

01:19:12.722 --> 01:19:14.622
What the hell was that?

01:19:21.598 --> 01:19:24.431
Oh, it must have been the wind.

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:27.330
There's no wind.

01:19:28.338 --> 01:19:29.999
-What?
-What?

01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:34.242
Great.

01:19:38.548 --> 01:19:42.075
Darling, my door's locked.
I guess the wind....

01:19:42.419 --> 01:19:44.410
David, it won't work.

01:19:44.621 --> 01:19:45.781
Now good night!

01:19:49.926 --> 01:19:51.257
Great.

01:20:19.055 --> 01:20:23.822
<i>Here's Johnny!</i>

01:20:41.945 --> 01:20:43.537
You all right, Agnes?

01:20:50.687 --> 01:20:54.623
Look at me!
I'll have to take another shower.

01:20:54.858 --> 01:20:57.258
I hate this! Jesus!

01:20:58.261 --> 01:20:59.751
Walter?

01:21:30.593 --> 01:21:32.925
It's not funny, David.

01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:39.996
Jesus.

01:21:48.411 --> 01:21:50.902
Plant seeds in my pocket.

01:21:52.582 --> 01:21:54.812
Great. I'm filthy.

01:22:22.278 --> 01:22:24.838
Why, what did you do that for?

01:22:33.356 --> 01:22:37.452
There you are, you filthy beast.
How did you get out?

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:41.323
Right. Come on.
Back in the pen you go.

01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:50.061
You gonna move or aren't you?

01:23:23.506 --> 01:23:25.974
-What's that?
-It's for Miss Gates.

01:23:26.175 --> 01:23:27.767
I'll take it.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.947
Why's he so happy?

01:23:32.148 --> 01:23:36.983
Hard to say. Last time he acted
like that, he'd run over the cat.

01:23:48.798 --> 01:23:51.892
Hello. Good morning.

01:23:52.168 --> 01:23:56.798
-You look very happy, David.
-So do you, darling.

01:23:57.006 --> 01:23:59.668
This is for you.

01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:06.548
Love you!

01:25:00.203 --> 01:25:04.401
Nadia, do you mind
if I eat this last chocolate?

01:25:04.607 --> 01:25:06.404
Sure, Mama.

01:25:09.078 --> 01:25:11.603
These are filled with brandy.

01:25:15.752 --> 01:25:18.220
You didn't eat this whole box?

01:25:18.421 --> 01:25:19.945
I didn't?

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.308
Shut up. Shut up!

01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:33.323
Dearly beloved...

01:26:33.529 --> 01:26:37.021
...we are gathered here
in this beautiful home...

01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:39.201
...on this beautiful day...

01:26:39.469 --> 01:26:43.064
...to witness the uniting
of two beautiful souls...

01:26:43.272 --> 01:26:45.206
...in holy wedlock.

01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:47.933
Marriage is a sacred commitment...

01:26:48.144 --> 01:26:52.274
...designed on Earth
and sanctified in heaven.

01:26:52.482 --> 01:26:55.076
Without the institution
of marriage...

01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:58.243
...mankind would still be
in the Dark Ages.

01:26:58.488 --> 01:27:01.821
Consider the marriage symbol,
the wedding ring.

01:27:02.024 --> 01:27:05.016
A perfect circle,
without beginning or end...

01:27:05.228 --> 01:27:08.220
...signifying God's
eternal love and devotion.

01:27:08.731 --> 01:27:12.565
For where would we be
without God's love?

01:27:22.445 --> 01:27:23.434
Cheap shoes.

01:27:25.281 --> 01:27:26.873
You all right, Agnes?

01:27:29.252 --> 01:27:33.916
And let us be ever mindful
of the consequences of our acts.

01:27:34.123 --> 01:27:36.114
God is watching.

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:40.528
Oh, Lord, she did eat them all.

01:27:41.063 --> 01:27:42.792
Have you been drinking?

01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:46.692
The time has come...

01:27:46.936 --> 01:27:50.565
...for David and Nadia
to make this commitment.

01:27:50.773 --> 01:27:54.641
Do you, David,
take Nadia to be your wife?

01:27:54.844 --> 01:27:58.473
-I haven't finished. To have and to--
-I do.

01:27:58.681 --> 01:28:02.117
--in sickness and health,
till death do you part?

01:28:02.318 --> 01:28:04.786
-Do you, Nadia, take David--
-Wait.

01:28:05.021 --> 01:28:07.854
Is it indelicate
to ask what's going on?

01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:11.856
-I don't love your son.
-Me neither. What's your point?

01:28:12.094 --> 01:28:15.928
-Take deep breaths.
-Screw the guests!

01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:21.434
-This will take time. Have champagne.
-I know we had a bargain.

01:28:21.671 --> 01:28:25.505
-Play some music, and kill the dog!
-Honey--

01:28:25.775 --> 01:28:27.709
What's this about a bargain?

01:28:27.944 --> 01:28:31.038
People shouldn't marry
because of a bargain.

01:28:33.082 --> 01:28:35.550
Would you just--
Come back here and finish this!

01:28:37.453 --> 01:28:39.546
Stop the music!

01:28:43.993 --> 01:28:48.327
Ladies and gentlemen,
maybe you can help me with this one.

01:28:50.299 --> 01:28:53.325
Say two people are gonna be married...

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:56.566
...and one doesn't love the other one.

01:28:57.373 --> 01:29:00.672
The other only thinks
he loves the other one...

01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:04.176
...because the other one
really loves another.

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.779
Are you with me?

01:29:08.451 --> 01:29:12.478
If two people don't love each other
should they get married?

01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:14.781
There you go.

01:29:15.057 --> 01:29:19.255
-If one adored the other one...
-But she didn't love him!

01:29:19.462 --> 01:29:22.727
...would die for her,
she'd learn to love him.

01:29:22.965 --> 01:29:27.163
But she loves another man
and would always think of him.

01:29:27.370 --> 01:29:31.033
-Not if he's dead! Not now, Father!
-Would any of you--

01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:34.968
Hold it. Hold it.

01:29:35.344 --> 01:29:39.212
The only way to get this resolved
is to take a vote.

01:29:39.415 --> 01:29:42.111
All those in favour
of Nadia and David...

01:29:42.318 --> 01:29:46.049
...not getting married, say ''aye.''

01:30:33.035 --> 01:30:35.629
Nadia! Get your mouth away from him!

01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:39.639
Listen to me! Nadia!
Get your hands off of him!
