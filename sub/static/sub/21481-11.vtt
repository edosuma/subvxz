00:39.572 --> 00:42.439
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.577
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.479 --> 00:47.468
Previously on The 4400:

00:47.647 --> 00:49.581
The Canadian border
is about 30 miles away.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.614
Cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.310
I didn't want us
to end, Thomas. Ever.

00:54.487 --> 00:56.717
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.119
- April.
- Surprised?

00:59.292 --> 01:00.623
How's it going, sibling?

01:00.794 --> 01:02.728
Jordan, you just told me
there's a little girl there

01:02.896 --> 01:04.557
who can see the future,
and she saw you dead.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.790
So I stay away from the Center,
I cut myself off.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.137
Even if you confess, Kyle,
he is still going to jail.

01:13.306 --> 01:16.173
If you try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.242
We have to get married.
It's the way we can be sure

01:18.411 --> 01:19.776
we'll never lose each other.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.506
Shawn! Shawn Farrell!

01:22.682 --> 01:25.480
Do you know who I am?

01:34.627 --> 01:36.618
Get out of the way! Jordan!

01:36.796 --> 01:38.855
Jordan! Let me through! Jordan!

01:40.300 --> 01:41.927
Jordan!

01:42.602 --> 01:44.297
Did you see Jordan Collier
come through here?

01:44.471 --> 01:46.371
- No, sir.
- Long hair, beard. Anyone?

01:47.574 --> 01:49.667
You saw him, right?

01:49.843 --> 01:51.936
Yeah. Look,
I want this place secure.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.740
No one gets in or out
until I say different.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.980
- Come on.
- All right, guys, let's look around.

02:04.591 --> 02:07.651
Guys, we've been all over the grounds
and we can't find anybody.

02:07.827 --> 02:09.020
Are you sure it was Collier?

02:09.195 --> 02:11.561
It was him. He looked right at me.
He talked to me.

02:11.731 --> 02:15.132
Well, it did look like him,
but I only saw him for a second.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.825
Well, if he's on foot, he can't be far.

02:17.003 --> 02:19.403
I think we should call NTAC,
get them to sweep the neighborhood.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.006
Shawn. What's going on?

02:22.175 --> 02:24.040
The ceremony was supposed
to start 20 minutes ago.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.905
Richard, I just saw Jordan.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.314
- He's alive. He's here.
- What?

02:29.382 --> 02:31.213
- Where?
- Shawn.

02:31.384 --> 02:33.375
- Me and Diana have to get moving.
- Hey, no, no, no.

02:33.553 --> 02:34.781
- I'm coming with you.
- What?

02:34.954 --> 02:37.047
I'm gonna help you find him.
Jordan looks different now.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.817
- I got the best view of him.
- You're in the middle of your wedding.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.690
We got a thousand guests here,
the media, lsabelle.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.956
You're gonna have to do
some damage control.

02:48.134 --> 02:49.931
Tell lsabelle
that the wedding's not off,

02:50.103 --> 02:53.595
it's just postponed, and I'll come
see her as soon as I can.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.331
I'm sorry.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.016
Are we ready to go?

03:13.826 --> 03:15.259
Daddy, what is it?

03:52.799 --> 03:54.767
I thought we agreed
I don't want to see you.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.458
This couldn't wait, Kyle.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.932
He's alive.

04:01.941 --> 04:04.068
Jordan Collier is alive.

04:06.679 --> 04:10.581
I'm gonna find him, Kyle,
and I'm gonna get you out of here.

04:15.755 --> 04:20.988
It's okay, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.
I just feel so bad for you.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.561
I'll be fine. You don't need
to worry about me.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.195
Shawn. Thank God. What happened?
All the guests are gone.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.858
Everybody thinks you walked out.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.765
That's-- It's okay. I just--

04:31.938 --> 04:35.704
I need to talk to lsabelle
for a second, if you don't mind.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.810
So your daddy came home, huh?

04:42.482 --> 04:44.973
- Your dad told you about Jordan?
- He did.

04:45.151 --> 04:48.609
I was really curious as to why
I wasn't getting married.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.724
I'm sorry, lsabelle. I am. It's--

04:52.892 --> 04:54.883
Jordan's out there somewhere.
I need to find him.

04:55.061 --> 04:58.155
And then what? If he's alive,
what does that mean for you and me?

04:58.331 --> 05:00.196
I'm not sure.

05:00.366 --> 05:05.668
- Jordan was dead and now he's not.
- Shawn, is the wedding off or isn't it?

05:06.973 --> 05:09.373
It's still gonna happen,
just not today.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.411
And not until I figure out
what's going on with Jordan.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.475
I know Collier means a lot to you,

05:18.518 --> 05:20.383
to everyone here.

05:22.455 --> 05:23.945
Find him.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.291
Di.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.658
April, my God,
what are you doing here?

06:42.835 --> 06:44.200
I came to see my sister.

06:44.370 --> 06:46.338
Tell me, do you have
some kind of allergy

06:46.506 --> 06:47.803
that keeps you from calling ahead?

06:48.741 --> 06:50.436
I wasn't sure that was a good idea.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.306
If I called, you might have
refused to see me.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.042
So are you gonna hug
your only sister

06:57.216 --> 06:58.774
or are you gonna
shut the door in my face?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.346
I'm sorry, I just--
You surprised me, that's all.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.251
I mean, I didn't even know
you were in Seattle.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.860
- I'm moving here.
- Why? Are you in trouble?

07:08.027 --> 07:09.187
No, I'm in love.

07:10.029 --> 07:11.997
I know what you're thinking:
"Same difference."

07:12.165 --> 07:14.099
But not this time.
This guy's the keeper.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.365
Oh, that's great.
I'm really happy for you.

07:17.537 --> 07:18.731
Well, wait till you meet him,

07:18.905 --> 07:20.896
which should be any minute now.
He's parking the car.

07:21.073 --> 07:22.973
April, I'm in the middle
of something for work.

07:23.142 --> 07:26.339
It won't take long.
Just a couple minutes, please.

07:26.512 --> 07:29.538
It would mean a lot.
I bet you Maia would be happy too.

07:29.715 --> 07:32.775
- Aunt April.
- Someone's getting tall.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.216
Look at you.
You're like a supermodel.

07:35.388 --> 07:39.984
I'll bet the boys think so too.
Maia, this is my friend Ben.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.626
I heard a lot about you,
young lady.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.352
Your aunt says
you're a very special girl.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.691
Maybe a little.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.298
Sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.926
I actually told April
we should have called ahead.

07:50.102 --> 07:51.296
See? Polite.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.668
And if you did a body search,
you wouldn't find a piercing anywhere.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.809
April mentioned
that you're a photographer.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.671
Yeah, April and l
just got back from lndia.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.075
I was doing a piece
on the caste system there.

08:01.247 --> 08:04.341
It's all for a show he's putting on
at the Museum of Contemporary Art.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.109
Really?

08:07.687 --> 08:09.245
- Well...
- Yeah.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.152
I spent some time in lndia
when I was a graduate student.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.816
We were doing an epidemiology study
in the Nilgiri range.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.224
We were there.

08:17.396 --> 08:19.990
Well, you are so lucky.
It was so beautiful.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.363
I used to just wake up early to watch
the sun come up over the foothills.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.164
Yeah, I got some shots of sunrises.
Just for my personal collection.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.705
If I'd known you were interested,
I'd have brought them by.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.241
- I'd like to see them.
- I'll bring them by.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.470
I look forward to it.
But right now I really gotta rush.

08:34.647 --> 08:35.671
Bye.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.350
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.551
- Bye.
- Bye. You're right, he is a keeper.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.466
This is a nice place.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.697
Collier sure had an eye
for real estate.

09:01.941 --> 09:05.775
I mean, what, this is the sixth place
we've looked at today?

09:05.945 --> 09:08.709
It must be nice
to have that kind of money.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.679
Diana, look at this.

09:12.318 --> 09:13.945
Someone's been staying here.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.587
Guys.

09:26.866 --> 09:30.267
It's from a soup kitchen downtown.
What does the notebook say?

09:30.436 --> 09:31.733
The whole thing's full.

09:31.904 --> 09:35.032
"The city is a thousand miles wide.
The last city.

09:35.207 --> 09:36.936
Walls are a hundred feet high.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.508
Nothing grows
on the outside anymore,

09:38.678 --> 09:40.646
so the people beg to be let in,
but nobody listens."

09:40.813 --> 09:43.145
- It's all like this.
- Is that Collier's handwriting?

09:44.483 --> 09:45.916
This is just preliminary,

09:46.085 --> 09:47.916
but I ran the handwriting
from the notebook

09:48.087 --> 09:50.021
against the sample from Collier's
that you gave me.

09:50.389 --> 09:52.414
Now, they don't look alike at all.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.457
I mean, the handwriting
from the notebook's shaky,

09:54.627 --> 09:56.094
almost like whoever did it is sick.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.787
But the software says
that they're a probable match.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.433
- That Jordan wrote this stuff?
- I can't say for sure,

10:01.601 --> 10:04.661
but there's a lab in D.C. that'll be able
to give us a positive identification.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.771
But it's probable, right?
Jordan's alive.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.373
- We don't know that yet.
- Yeah, I'll tell you one thing.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.032
If he did write this,

10:11.210 --> 10:13.303
he has seen some interesting stuff
while he's been gone.

10:13.479 --> 10:16.880
And the whole thing goes on and on
about a walled city.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.643
You know, a privileged elite
lives on the inside,

10:19.819 --> 10:22.583
everything else is just a wasteland.
And then the last few pages

10:22.755 --> 10:24.916
are just one phrase
repeated over and over again.

10:25.091 --> 10:28.117
"The war for the future
will be fought in the past."

10:38.437 --> 10:39.961
Mommy?

10:41.073 --> 10:43.541
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.971
I couldn't sleep.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.702
Oh, well...

10:46.879 --> 10:49.780
Why don't you come on in?
I'll make you a bowl of ice cream.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.849
Our family's gonna get bigger now.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.519
Oh, sweetie.

10:54.687 --> 10:58.088
Don't get too attached to the idea
of your Aunt April living in Seattle.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.020
You know how she can be.

11:00.192 --> 11:03.889
That's not it.
You're gonna get married.

11:04.864 --> 11:08.766
I saw it. Not too long from now.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.094
You look the same when it happens.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.065
I'm getting married?

11:13.539 --> 11:17.373
Isn't it great?
You're gonna be so happy.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.578
Okay, well...

11:21.080 --> 11:23.014
Did you happen to see
who the lucky guy was?

11:23.716 --> 11:27.948
Yeah, it was the man
we just met. Ben.

11:30.089 --> 11:34.355
Maia, you saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?

11:35.594 --> 11:37.118
But Ben is with Aunt April.

11:38.397 --> 11:39.864
I guess they don't stay together,

11:40.032 --> 11:42.557
because you two
are gonna get married.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.065
You're gonna have a husband,
I'm gonna have a dad.

11:46.739 --> 11:49.207
Isn't that the best?

11:59.351 --> 12:02.752
Hello? Oh, hey, Tom.

12:02.922 --> 12:06.483
No, we're up.

12:08.527 --> 12:09.789
Have you seen this man?

12:09.962 --> 12:13.022
Sure. I volunteer
at St. Alban's kitchen.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.168
These guys brought the sketch by
when we were closing up tonight.

12:16.335 --> 12:17.893
We bring food down here
twice a week.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.662
- I've seen him.
- Are you sure about that?

12:19.839 --> 12:20.931
Positive.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.803
I remember him because everyone
lets him go to the front of the line.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.467
They get out of his way.
I've never seen that before.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.738
- You haven't seen him today?
- Not for a couple weeks.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.681
But I always see him
eating with Will.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.945
Will's kind of
the elder statesman around here.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.555
He knows just about everyone.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.987
Yeah, I know him. We all do.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.553
- The preacher.
- The preacher?

12:42.728 --> 12:45.288
He never said
his real name was Jordan Collier.

12:45.464 --> 12:48.297
I thought that Collier was dead.
Who are you guys, anyway?

12:48.467 --> 12:50.196
We're from NTAC.
We need to find this man.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.599
- When's the last time you saw him?
- Just now.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.864
- What?
- He's here?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.935
He's always here.

12:59.578 --> 13:02.240
This is pretty empty.
You're sure he's back here?

13:02.414 --> 13:04.575
He never goes anywhere.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.012
Okay.

13:08.387 --> 13:12.585
Say hello to the preacher.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.034
You made a painting of him?

13:28.507 --> 13:30.338
Not me personally,

13:30.509 --> 13:34.969
but the preacher's a popular guy.
He's got some amazing stories.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.046
The guy claims
to have seen the future.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.411
People around here...

13:41.453 --> 13:43.182
...we believe him.

14:05.544 --> 14:06.772
You lied to me, lsabelle.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.455
I don't remember much
about being a baby.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.184
You and Mom mostly. Vague stuff.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.524
I remember Collier.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.363
I remember
how he made you guys feel,

14:27.533 --> 14:30.024
and I remember how I felt
when he touched Mom that time.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.727
Well, you gave him
something to remember that day.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.236
Collier was recovering for months.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.077
That's not the only thing I did to him.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.640
Right before he died
he came to talk to me.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.719
I know it sounds weird.
I was just a baby.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.153
But he wanted me to tell him
whether it was safe to go ahead

14:52.324 --> 14:55.782
- with the party he was planning.
- I remember.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.952
He asked to take you for a walk
through the gardens.

14:58.130 --> 15:01.361
He wanted power.
He wanted acclaim.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.558
A name that would live on
after he died.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.998
So that's what I showed him.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.999
So, what? You gave him a vision?

15:10.476 --> 15:13.001
He had the party. He got shot.

15:13.879 --> 15:17.110
I didn't pull the trigger, but,
Daddy, I made that happen.

15:20.686 --> 15:23.348
If Collier's back,
he knows what I did.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.487
What does he want? Revenge?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.523
We don't even know
whether or not he is alive.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.593
What if he tells Shawn what I did?

15:31.163 --> 15:33.028
You sound
like you're scared of Collier.

15:33.732 --> 15:37.725
Isabelle,
Collier is a very powerful man,

15:37.903 --> 15:39.165
but he is just a man.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.971
He was just a man.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.003
We don't know what he is now.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.313
Guys, I've got something
you need to check out.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.916
You know that graffiti mural?
The one that might be Collier?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.882
Well, there's a national
graffiti database.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.022
- I ran the portrait against it.
- And?

15:57.189 --> 15:59.783
This preacher guy, he gets around.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.116
That one's from Saint Louis.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.457
That's El Paso. Tempe, Arizona.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.428
- Reno.
- These are from all over the country.

16:07.599 --> 16:10.261
If this is Collier,
he's been a very busy man.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.768
Might need a shave and a haircut,
but he's still got charisma.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.872
- He's got followers everywhere.
- So, what?

16:15.040 --> 16:18.476
He's traveling around,
preaching the gospel of the future?

16:26.251 --> 16:28.845
Are you almost done?
I was gonna make you a snack.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.386
- Five more minutes.
- Okay.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.085
Did you see Ben today?

16:34.126 --> 16:36.492
You mean
your Aunt April's boyfriend?

16:38.063 --> 16:41.999
No, I didn't see him,
and I'm not going to see him.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.829
Your antenna is not working right
on this one, sweetie.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.364
Okay.

16:56.382 --> 16:57.679
Hi.

16:59.918 --> 17:02.887
I'm not the type of guy who drops by
unannounced all the time, I promise.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.387
- Okay.
- But I was just in the neighborhood,

17:05.557 --> 17:09.049
I didn't have your phone number.
The pictures we talked about.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.124
Thanks.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.064
Come in.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.605
- Hi, Maia.
- Hi, Ben.

17:21.773 --> 17:25.107
I need to go to my room and study.
You two talk.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.940
So you gonna open it?

17:39.191 --> 17:42.592
Does that look familiar?
That's the Nilgiri Hills.

17:42.761 --> 17:43.785
Yeah.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.831
Listen, this is not gonna happen.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.462
Excuse me?

17:54.306 --> 17:55.830
Married?

17:57.042 --> 17:59.203
Are you sure she meant me?

18:01.613 --> 18:05.447
- Well, that can't happen.
- I'm glad you agree.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.312
April told me about Maia,
what she could do,

18:07.486 --> 18:10.853
- but she's wrong here, right?
- Oh, she's gonna be.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.827
Okay, I'm gonna go.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.824
And no more visits
to bring you pictures.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.591
No more visits, period.

18:23.168 --> 18:26.103
Okay. Well, it was nice meeting you

18:26.505 --> 18:28.097
and then resolving
never to see you again.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.475
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.
- Yeah.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.638
Did you kill me?

19:12.818 --> 19:14.513
It's him.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.847
That's him. That's Jordan Collier.

19:17.623 --> 19:21.684
That's Jordan Collier!
Tell them I didn't kill you!

19:21.860 --> 19:23.350
Tell them you're Jordan Collier!

19:23.862 --> 19:29.198
Tell them! Tell them
you're Jordan Collier! Tell them!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.940
Is that who I am?

19:50.689 --> 19:54.750
When you went to see Kyle,
you signed in as Jeffrey Paulson.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.155
Why?

19:56.328 --> 19:59.991
I found a library card
in the pocket of my coat,

20:00.165 --> 20:01.564
and that's what it said. I thought--

20:02.568 --> 20:04.468
I thought maybe that was my name.

20:04.636 --> 20:05.898
Your name is Jordan Collier.

20:06.738 --> 20:10.367
You don't remember that?
You're one of the 4400.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.271
- Am l?
- You were shot.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.938
You died.

20:18.517 --> 20:23.216
Yes, I saw that in the papers.
I thought I looked like that man.

20:24.856 --> 20:27.882
You disappeared. Do you have
any idea where you've been?

20:28.627 --> 20:29.889
Everywhere.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.293
I have been everywhere.

20:37.936 --> 20:43.465
I've been alive for hundreds of years.
Maybe thousands.

20:44.276 --> 20:49.213
I couldn't speak to anyone.
I just-- I wandered.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.679
No food, no sleep.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.816
And I watched it all.

21:02.828 --> 21:06.730
I watched the world change,

21:07.299 --> 21:10.166
and it just kept getting worse.

21:10.335 --> 21:14.772
And the skies filled with smoke...

21:16.642 --> 21:19.634
...and all the machines
stopped working,

21:19.811 --> 21:23.303
and the streets and the rivers

21:23.482 --> 21:26.610
were filled with bodies.

21:27.419 --> 21:31.412
And the dead were everywhere,

21:32.424 --> 21:36.861
and the Earth cried out

21:37.396 --> 21:42.493
and it never stopped.

21:45.504 --> 21:48.530
The things you're talking about,
they haven't happened.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.142
- Not yet, anyway.
- It's 2006.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.042
It's been less than a year
since you were shot.

21:58.917 --> 22:04.184
How could it be?
I've been wandering for so long.

22:06.725 --> 22:08.750
That's the preliminary DNA report.

22:08.927 --> 22:11.020
That man we're holding
is Jordan Collier.

22:11.196 --> 22:13.187
Well, at least somebody's sure of it.

22:13.365 --> 22:16.300
I need Collier to remember who he is
so he can stand in front of a judge

22:16.468 --> 22:17.765
and ask for my son to be freed.

22:17.936 --> 22:21.872
But, Tom, this is already a win for Kyle.
Collier's alive.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.271
So he serves a term for
attempted murder instead of murder?

22:25.444 --> 22:27.969
No, no, no, Diana.
That's not good enough.

22:28.146 --> 22:31.343
Look, Collier knows who he is.
It's buried in there somewhere.

22:31.516 --> 22:32.710
He showed up at the wedding.

22:32.884 --> 22:35.682
He found his way
to one of his safe houses.

22:38.290 --> 22:41.350
We just need to find a way
to help bring it all to the surface.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.862
Tom, I just got off the phone
with the National Security Advisor.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.930
He wants to schedule
a conference call with him, me

22:47.099 --> 22:48.293
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

22:48.467 --> 22:51.197
to discuss the fact that Jordan Collier
is somehow back from the dead.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.999
And you want me to look the other way
while Alana Mareva, a fugitive,

22:55.173 --> 22:57.505
walks into NTAC
and uses her ability on Collier?

22:57.676 --> 23:00.839
She can access his memories.
Show him his life.

23:01.012 --> 23:02.377
These people in D.C.,

23:02.547 --> 23:04.515
they need Collier to remember
who he is too, right?

23:04.683 --> 23:07.151
They need answers. This might be
the only way to get them.

23:09.287 --> 23:11.278
Nina, please.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.284
We're talking about my son.

23:24.102 --> 23:25.660
You have a way
to get in touch with Alana?

23:31.042 --> 23:32.669
Make the call.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.773
I got it, Maia.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.644
You just couldn't stand
to see me happy, could you?

23:43.822 --> 23:46.723
- April, what are you talking about?
- What did you say to Ben?

23:46.892 --> 23:50.328
- What did you say, Diana?
- Nothing, why?

23:50.495 --> 23:52.588
He broke up with me!

23:54.232 --> 23:55.824
You weren't supposed
to break up with her.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.662
That's not why I told you
what Maia said.

23:57.836 --> 24:00.862
I realize that,
but you have to understand,

24:01.039 --> 24:04.008
a precog just told me
that I was with the wrong person.

24:04.376 --> 24:08.608
And if you know you're with
the wrong person, why stay with them?

24:09.648 --> 24:11.616
I don't know,
maybe because you love them.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.580
I do love April.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.114
At least I thought I did.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.722
You know, I can't believe
how casual you can be with all this.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.658
Maybe it's because
you live with a 4400,

24:20.826 --> 24:23.989
but someone just told me
that I met the person, the woman,

24:24.162 --> 24:25.390
that I'm supposed to be with...

24:26.965 --> 24:28.762
...and I can't ignore it.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.598
And I want you to tell me the truth.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.580
When you look at me,
do you feel anything at all?

24:43.114 --> 24:45.514
An attraction?
An inkling of an attraction?

24:51.656 --> 24:54.352
Yes, I do.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.151
You asked for the truth,
so yes, I do.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.526
And if I met you
under different circumstances,

25:00.699 --> 25:02.690
I'd wanna see you again.

25:05.303 --> 25:06.531
Yeah.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.436
Me too.

25:10.609 --> 25:15.512
- But it doesn't matter, we can't do it.
- Yeah, I know.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.615
I'm gonna take
my sister's stuff and go.

25:23.154 --> 25:27.215
But wouldn't it be something if we were
giving up our shot at happiness?

26:03.328 --> 26:06.388
- Hello, Thomas.
- You cut your hair.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.668
I can't believe you're here.
Thank you for doing this.

26:12.837 --> 26:15.397
For Kyle, I'll do anything,
you know that.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.906
Besides, I've missed you.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.304
Are you ready?

26:29.854 --> 26:32.823
You don't have to do anything.
Just shut your eyes and relax.

26:37.495 --> 26:40.259
You won't feel anything, I promise.

26:53.211 --> 26:54.940
My name's Jordan Collier.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.775
- If I could stay here for a while--
- You're one of the 4400.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.940
That baby could be
the key to the future.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.552
Peter has all the time in the world.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.848
Hi, Peter.
My name's Jordan Collier.

27:06.725 --> 27:08.852
Hello, Richard.
Welcome to the revolution.

27:22.540 --> 27:23.837
Collier, are you all right?

27:38.056 --> 27:42.390
My name is Jordan Collier.

27:43.194 --> 27:46.027
I know why they sent us back.

27:47.932 --> 27:49.194
I saw the catastrophe

27:49.367 --> 27:51.767
and I know what we have to do
to stop it.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.552
You say you have all these answers.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.553
Tell us what they are and then we
can talk about letting you out of here.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.554
You'll learn what I know
when everyone else does.

28:13.725 --> 28:14.851
When will that be?

28:15.026 --> 28:18.621
As soon as I'm free, you and the world
will know what I know.

28:19.264 --> 28:21.198
And what if we hold you indefinitely?

28:22.033 --> 28:24.627
- I've grown accustomed to waiting.
- Yeah, well, I can't.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.369
My son is in prison. You're
the only one who can get him out.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.474
Then you want me released
as badly as I do.

28:32.977 --> 28:35.377
Your son Kyle is innocent.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.813
He is a pawn, and I will say that
to whomever you want

28:39.984 --> 28:42.111
the moment I am a free man.

28:42.287 --> 28:43.811
I can't believe this, Nina.

28:43.988 --> 28:46.081
My son could be one court appearance
away from freedom

28:46.257 --> 28:48.384
and you're refusing to let Collier
testify on his behalf?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.959
I'm not refusing, the Pentagon is.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.187
Their official position is
Collier's not even back.

28:52.363 --> 28:55.093
Come on, Nina. They can't honestly
believe that they can squash this.

28:55.266 --> 28:56.733
Well, they're gonna try.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.801
Look, Collier's return
changes everything.

28:58.970 --> 29:01.996
We're not just talking
about galvanizing the 4400.

29:02.173 --> 29:03.936
There are religious groups
all over the world

29:04.109 --> 29:05.406
who would consider him
the messiah.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.511
No matter what he says,
no matter how crazy it is,

29:07.679 --> 29:09.476
people are going to listen.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.512
So maybe we should find out
what's on his mind

29:11.683 --> 29:13.344
before we stick him
in front of microphones.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.179
What if we don't like
what he has to say?

29:15.353 --> 29:17.514
We stick him in the basement,
pretend this never happened?

29:18.056 --> 29:20.456
I don't think
that's gonna be our decision.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.617
I'd be surprised if Collier's not
transferred out of here by tomorrow.

29:27.832 --> 29:30.062
They should be here by now.

29:32.203 --> 29:33.295
You sure you're okay?

29:35.707 --> 29:37.038
I will be.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.944
When I touched Collier,
those things I saw,

29:41.112 --> 29:43.979
they weren't only from his past.
There were other images too.

29:44.149 --> 29:45.138
Terrible ones.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.581
It was like a nightmare.

29:48.753 --> 29:53.452
I don't know how Collier
lived through it and stayed sane.

30:01.299 --> 30:06.601
I don't wanna leave you, Thomas.
I don't wanna go on the run again.

30:06.771 --> 30:12.073
Well, maybe you don't have to.
What you did today, it helped NTAC.

30:12.243 --> 30:14.677
If I tell them they can have
access to your ability,

30:14.846 --> 30:16.541
maybe they'll drop
the charges against you.

30:16.714 --> 30:20.115
- I'd never hurt the 4400s.
- I know, I know.

30:20.285 --> 30:23.379
Maybe we can work it
so you don't have to, okay?

30:24.255 --> 30:26.917
- Uncle Tom.
- Wait right here.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.091
What the hell's going on?

30:35.266 --> 30:37.291
I didn't help find Jordan
so you could lock him away.

30:37.468 --> 30:38.901
Shawn, they're scared.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.163
This is how the government reacts
when it's scared.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.569
You know, if we wanted
we could take him.

30:46.411 --> 30:48.811
If we set our minds to it,
we can get into NTAC

30:48.980 --> 30:51.380
and there won't be anything
you can do to stop us.

30:51.549 --> 30:53.676
You may be right.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.652
But there might be
another way. Here.

30:56.821 --> 30:59.585
That's a still
from a security camera at NTAC.

30:59.757 --> 31:02.453
It was taken this afternoon.
You show it to everyone.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.590
You let the world know
that Collier's back.

31:12.503 --> 31:15.370
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

31:47.505 --> 31:49.234
Wagon Wheels.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.271
You know, I used to live
on those things in college.

31:52.443 --> 31:55.276
Ben, what are you doing here?

31:55.713 --> 31:57.510
I eat too.

32:01.386 --> 32:06.119
So, what do you think?

32:07.091 --> 32:08.649
Coincidence,
or is this thing gonna happen

32:08.826 --> 32:10.794
whether we try to stop it or not?

32:17.068 --> 32:20.231
Well, normally, I'd give you a lecture
about free will right now,

32:20.405 --> 32:24.535
but I have to admit,
it might sound a little hollow.

32:31.282 --> 32:35.150
Well, we're both here,
both shopping.

32:36.654 --> 32:37.882
Wanna join forces?

33:01.679 --> 33:03.442
--loved doing the final project.

33:03.614 --> 33:07.414
Let me guess, faces of the elderly?

33:08.252 --> 33:10.152
Red lights.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.586
Every time I'd stop at a red light,
I'd take a picture.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.454
You know, you have to study
these intersections

33:16.627 --> 33:19.061
that you never really noticed.

33:19.230 --> 33:22.529
Like the stores, the people,

33:22.700 --> 33:25.692
the garbage cans, everything.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.667
That's very creative.

33:28.206 --> 33:30.697
- I was just screwing around.
- I would like to see them.

33:30.875 --> 33:33.343
Okay, yeah.
I think I've got them somewhere.

33:33.511 --> 33:36.742
No, wait.

33:36.914 --> 33:38.711
- What?
- We can't do this.

33:38.883 --> 33:43.149
We just did. That was a date,
and that was a pretty good one.

33:43.321 --> 33:47.781
No, it wasn't.
It was nice, but it wasn't a date.

33:48.459 --> 33:50.654
Then why do I feel like doing this?

33:59.604 --> 34:02.266
You gotta admit
that was nice too.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.704
Can I see you again?

34:16.320 --> 34:18.719
Free Collier now. Free Collier now.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.358
- Free Collier now.
- Anyone else feel like it's Bastille Day?

34:21.525 --> 34:23.322
Well, it does feel like
the start of something.

34:23.494 --> 34:26.793
We have gotta let him go.
It's either that or bring in troops.

34:26.964 --> 34:28.898
And we won't just be
reading the riot act to 4400s.

34:29.067 --> 34:33.003
There's clergy out there. Citizens.
Look, we can't just sit on this.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.833
If Collier is some kind of messiah,
he needs to be free.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.304
If he's not,
letting him out is still the right move.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.643
It will give him enough rope
to hang himself.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.347
I'll call D.C.,
but they're gonna wanna know

34:44.514 --> 34:47.712
how those people got their hands
on a picture of Collier.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.683
Any idea what I should tell them?

34:50.855 --> 34:53.449
Yeah, tell them
it's hard to cover up a resurrection.

34:53.623 --> 34:58.618
Free Collier now.
Free Collier now. Free Collier now.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.700
Free Collier now.
Free Collier now. Free Collier now.

35:12.577 --> 35:13.805
Stay back.

35:21.085 --> 35:23.315
It's you. Welcome back, Jordan.

35:28.726 --> 35:31.024
Thank you for keeping
the Center alive while I was gone.

35:33.331 --> 35:37.427
Richard,
glad to see you still with us.

35:37.602 --> 35:39.297
You'll have an important role to play.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.239
I stand here and I see the future:

35:51.382 --> 35:53.646
4400s and non-4400s

35:53.818 --> 35:57.083
working hand in hand
toward a common goal.

35:57.255 --> 36:01.521
Saving humanity is no longer
the exclusive province of the 4400.

36:02.093 --> 36:06.189
Each and every one of you
will have work to do.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.491
And the work starts now.

36:09.133 --> 36:11.465
We're going to the court house.

36:12.036 --> 36:14.402
There is an innocent man
who needs to be freed.

36:33.491 --> 36:36.927
Look, just get those people
away from this building.

36:37.094 --> 36:38.789
You're impeding
the business of my court.

36:38.963 --> 36:42.296
They won't leave until you listen
to what I have to say.

36:42.733 --> 36:45.167
I hereby withdraw
any and all charges

36:45.336 --> 36:47.463
against Kyle Baldwin
for my alleged murder.

36:48.639 --> 36:52.575
Well, Mr. Baldwin
still assaulted two federal agents.

36:52.743 --> 36:55.268
Now, he fired a high-powered weapon
into a crowd of people,

36:55.446 --> 36:57.437
and he admitted it all
in a detailed confession.

36:57.615 --> 37:00.106
My son has been in jail for months.
He's a first-time offender.

37:00.284 --> 37:01.911
You could release him
with time served.

37:02.086 --> 37:03.986
Those people out there,
they listen to me.

37:04.155 --> 37:07.750
They will be back every day
until this man's son goes free.

37:09.126 --> 37:12.687
Well, these are
highly unusual circumstances,

37:12.863 --> 37:14.660
I'll grant you both that.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.794
Perhaps we can revisit
the murder plea.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.602
Do. Quickly.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.504
Thank you.

37:55.740 --> 38:00.177
- Thought you didn't wanna see me.
- I don't. I wanna see your pictures.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.006
Well, okay. So I knew you'd be here.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.347
Then why did you come?

38:09.020 --> 38:11.386
I guess I've been thinking
about the grocery store,

38:11.555 --> 38:16.151
and I thought
it was a good date too.

38:18.229 --> 38:21.289
It just didn't end right.

38:23.534 --> 38:25.161
Okay.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.766
Then how should it have ended?

38:46.524 --> 38:48.287
Hi, Mommy.

38:49.894 --> 38:52.362
- Hi.
- Where you been, Di?

38:52.530 --> 38:56.330
Nowhere, I just had to work late.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.342
I'm sorry.

40:20.351 --> 40:24.014
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't apologize.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.651
Those things you saw in me--

40:26.824 --> 40:30.157
Pride, ambition, vanity.
--they were there.

40:30.728 --> 40:33.026
I had to die to lose them.

40:36.867 --> 40:41.133
I've done bad things
and I'm supposed to do more.

40:41.305 --> 40:42.499
I know.

40:44.008 --> 40:45.270
And I'm trying not to.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.440
Tell me what to do. I'll do anything.

41:00.024 --> 41:01.218
Leave.

41:02.359 --> 41:06.295
Leave the 4400 Center
and never come back.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.292
Nothing you can do will change
what you are, lsabelle.

41:10.468 --> 41:14.063
You are the enemy of the 4400.
The enemy of everything that is good.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.304
And that part of you that is human...

41:20.678 --> 41:22.839
...it is much smaller
than the part of you that's not,

41:23.013 --> 41:26.346
and your struggle
to keep it alive will fail.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.346
No, no.

41:33.357 --> 41:36.224
- I have a choice.
- Others might, not you.

41:45.636 --> 41:49.697
If that's true, if we're enemies, then
why shouldn't I just kill you right now?

41:49.874 --> 41:53.173
You're welcome to try,
but it won't work.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.245
I'm ready for you this time.

42:00.584 --> 42:02.848
This place is mine again...

42:08.592 --> 42:10.719
...and you're not welcome here.

42:12.963 --> 42:14.931
Goodbye, lsabelle.
