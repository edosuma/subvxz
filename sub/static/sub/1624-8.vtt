WEBVTT

00:00.824 --> 00:04.827
Pick up. Table ten, table 12, table 69.

00:04.828 --> 00:07.329
Oleg, there is no table 69.

00:07.330 --> 00:10.667
There could be.

00:10.668 --> 00:12.168
Oleg just sixty-nined me,

00:12.169 --> 00:15.104
and now I don't remember
any of the table numbers.

00:15.105 --> 00:16.839
Look, he's never gonna
stop sixty-nining us.

00:16.840 --> 00:17.974
Forget the table numbers.

00:17.975 --> 00:19.441
Here's how you remember your orders.

00:19.442 --> 00:20.743
You just give people nicknames.

00:20.744 --> 00:22.879
Look, I got thin cee lo,

00:22.880 --> 00:26.716
fat rihanna, jon beret ramsey,

00:26.717 --> 00:29.152
and kristen bad wig.

00:29.153 --> 00:30.519
Oh, okay.

00:30.520 --> 00:31.921
I got seth rogaine,

00:31.922 --> 00:33.389
child molester moustache,

00:33.390 --> 00:36.192
and lesbian justin bieber.

00:36.193 --> 00:38.728
- Good.
- Thanks.

00:38.729 --> 00:41.330
Pick up. Table six.

00:41.331 --> 00:44.133
...ty-nine.

00:55.455 --> 00:55.455
+

00:58.058 --> 00:59.392
So can I get you anything else?

00:59.393 --> 01:02.762
Coffee? Dessert? Morning-after pill?

01:02.763 --> 01:05.532
Okay.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.000
Getting it on in a restaurant.

01:08.001 --> 01:11.170
I once made love to a
young angela lansbury

01:11.171 --> 01:13.607
in a booth just like that.

01:13.608 --> 01:14.774
<i>Murder she wrote?</i>

01:14.775 --> 01:18.612
more like "harder she begged."

01:18.613 --> 01:20.647
Earl, why isn't everyone you?

01:20.648 --> 01:22.349
Yo, what's up, mama?

01:22.350 --> 01:23.450
Oh, hey, johnny.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.118
Usual? Two coffees to go?

01:25.119 --> 01:27.019
Yeah, and can I get
two of your cupcakes?

01:27.020 --> 01:28.988
Which two?

01:28.989 --> 01:30.490
You know which two.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.692
The discounted day-olds?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.561
Yeah, girl.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.529
Hey, my bro and friend.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.465
Hey, what's up, big guy?

01:44.472 --> 01:47.006
Max, your boyfriend is here.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.375
He's not my boyfriend.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.209
He's just another guy
who likes my cupcakes.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.245
'cause who doesn't?

01:52.246 --> 01:54.714
Well, your face gets
red when you see him,

01:54.715 --> 01:58.017
and you suddenly act like nice person.

01:58.018 --> 02:01.688
If that's not love,
I don't know what is.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.456
He doesn't know what love is.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.692
The only thing he ever
loved was a stepladder.

02:08.362 --> 02:12.231
Johnny, here's your stale
cake and burnt coffee.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.301
Just how I like it.
What do I owe you?

02:14.302 --> 02:15.302
It's on me.

02:17.070 --> 02:21.007
You wish it was on you.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.009
There's nothing going on.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.444
He just comes in here to get coffee

02:24.445 --> 02:26.112
because he tags billboards all night.

02:26.113 --> 02:29.416
Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.484
Listen, renaissance fair,

02:31.485 --> 02:34.387
why don't you be a good wench
and clean up your counter?

02:38.326 --> 02:40.026
Until the cupcake business takes off,

02:40.027 --> 02:42.329
i'm just gonna have to
find a temp job online.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.765
Can I close this window that says
"mexican painkillers"?

02:45.766 --> 02:49.168
Yeah, yeah, but, uh,
bookmark it first.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.138
Here we are. Craigslist. Okay.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.606
How does this job sound?

02:53.607 --> 02:55.442
Disgusting and depraved.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.076
You didn't even hear it yet.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.879
Did I not hear "craigslist"?

02:59.880 --> 03:02.215
Oh. Here's something easy I could do.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.517
A professional organizer.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.785
You're not a professional organizer.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.354
You're barely a professional waitress.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.322
I am a genius at organizing things

03:09.323 --> 03:10.724
and getting them out of the way.

03:10.725 --> 03:13.693
I recently lost all my money and
the promise of a bright future,

03:13.694 --> 03:15.628
and I've organized that
into a file in my head

03:15.629 --> 03:18.631
labeled "do not open
until you are stronger."

03:18.632 --> 03:19.999
If I can handle that for myself,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.736
I can certainly handle a
stranger's light filing.

03:22.737 --> 03:24.070
If I had known all that craziness

03:24.071 --> 03:25.304
was going on in your head,

03:25.305 --> 03:27.340
I would have ordered you
some mexican pain killers.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.008
Or the peruvian.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.410
They're stronger,

03:30.411 --> 03:34.881
but sometimes they make you
lose control of your hands.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.751
Thought that was an ibuprofen.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.888
What is johnny doing
here at 3:00 a. M.?

03:41.889 --> 03:44.924
Thought it was a rapist or something.

03:44.925 --> 03:49.362
Rapists don't knock and wave.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.865
And if they looked like that,
we wouldn't call them rapists.

03:51.866 --> 03:54.768
We'd call them... Johnny!

03:54.769 --> 03:56.503
What are you doing here?

03:56.504 --> 03:58.271
I'm here to talk to you guys

03:58.272 --> 04:00.940
about the church of latter day saints.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.643
And I have to pee.
Can I use your bathroom?

04:03.644 --> 04:07.881
No problem. Don't forget to
tip the bathroom attendant.

04:07.882 --> 04:09.115
What's up, caroline?

04:09.116 --> 04:10.650
Just trying to find a day job

04:10.651 --> 04:13.119
where I won't get
handcuffed to a radiator.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.456
On craigslist?

04:18.926 --> 04:20.660
This is so romantic.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.429
Jumping over the back wall

04:22.430 --> 04:24.731
to drop down and see you
in the middle of the night?

04:24.732 --> 04:26.399
<i>It's very romeo and juliet.</i>

04:26.400 --> 04:28.034
<i>it is very romeo and juliet.</i>

04:28.035 --> 04:31.571
He has to pee,
and I'm the nearest toilet.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.673
Please. That's just an excuse.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.909
The man defaces buildings. And what?

04:35.910 --> 04:37.310
He draws the line at peeing on them?

04:37.311 --> 04:38.912
He came by here to see you.

04:38.913 --> 04:41.314
Pull your hair back.
It's kind of in your face.

04:41.315 --> 04:44.784
Pull yourself back.
You're kind of in my face.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.719
Thanks, guys.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.621
I was tagging a building nearby,

04:48.622 --> 04:49.722
and while I was on the roof

04:49.723 --> 04:50.890
I saw that your light was on,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.759
so I thought I'd stop in and say hey.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.226
- Hey.
- So, johnny,

04:54.227 --> 04:56.729
you just saw our light
on from the roof nearby?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.030
Interesting.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.266
Do you always look down
when you're up that high?

05:00.267 --> 05:01.267
Not really.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.135
Interesting.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.575
Flying solo tonight.
My lookout guy went into rehab.

05:08.576 --> 05:09.809
It's kind of a pain.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.377
It's really a two-person operation.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.645
Ugh, such a bummer when people

05:12.646 --> 05:15.682
can't handle their heroin.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.918
Hey, max, what are you doing
tomorrow night after work?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.653
Any desire to be my lookout guy?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.022
I might have some desire
to be your lookout guy,

05:23.023 --> 05:25.358
but as far as the "guy"
part of "lookout guy" goes,

05:25.359 --> 05:26.359
full disclosure-

05:26.360 --> 05:27.627
What, you don't have a penis?

05:27.628 --> 05:30.129
Oh, I have one.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.398
In a drawer in my bedroom.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.905
If the cops come tomorrow,

05:38.906 --> 05:40.840
I will run like a girl.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.309
Okay. So pick you up
at the diner at 2:00?

05:43.310 --> 05:45.011
- Cool.
- Cool.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.013
Cool.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.218
And then romeo left.

05:52.219 --> 05:55.254
So romantic. All the weeks
of flirting and game playing

05:55.255 --> 05:56.689
have finally led to this-

05:56.690 --> 05:58.791
You two on a late-night roof rendezvous.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.560
Hey, genius organizer,

06:00.561 --> 06:03.095
why don't you put all that
garbage in a file labeled

06:03.096 --> 06:06.265
"I've seen too many
katherine heigl movies"?

06:06.266 --> 06:08.868
I'm just saying, he likes you.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.572
He likes you with his penis.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.211
There. 3f.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.747
All right. You're here.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.781
Goodbye. Go organize.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.382
No, I said you have to wait

06:23.383 --> 06:25.351
until I open the door and
check out if it's safe.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.520
It's my day off.
You're the one with the job.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.288
And you're the one who
freaked me out so much

06:29.289 --> 06:31.024
about going into
a stranger's apartment.

06:31.025 --> 06:32.625
What did I say that was so bad?

06:32.626 --> 06:34.393
You told me he'd cut off my face

06:34.394 --> 06:36.729
and wear it as a party hat.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.799
I said... "probably."

06:39.800 --> 06:42.201
Probably cut off your face.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.403
Nothing bad is gonna
happen to you, okay?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.072
Okay.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.874
It's a safe-enough
looking building, right?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.075
Yes.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.177
Look, they have those
hallway trash chutes.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.914
That's probably how he'll get
rid of your faceless body!

06:54.915 --> 06:56.816
You're right. I'm fine. Go.

06:56.817 --> 07:00.119
Caroline's second job. So proud.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.055
Call me if you freak out or anything.

07:02.056 --> 07:04.791
How am I gonna call you
without a face?

07:04.792 --> 07:08.127
I'm fine. I'm not gonna call you.

07:09.997 --> 07:13.132
Hello, it's caroline,
the professional organizer.

07:17.838 --> 07:21.674
Hello?
Someone called for an organizer?

07:21.675 --> 07:27.080
Hello?

07:27.081 --> 07:29.616
Oh, no. Oh, hell no.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.550
Max, come back!

07:34.920 --> 07:34.920
+

07:37.720 --> 07:38.953
Hurry up. This is so exciting!

07:38.954 --> 07:40.054
What are you talking about?

07:40.055 --> 07:41.122
I'm not going back in there.

07:41.123 --> 07:42.557
He's a hoarder. A hoarder.

07:42.558 --> 07:43.792
It's a bad reality show.

07:43.793 --> 07:46.127
Hey, that is a great reality show.

07:46.128 --> 07:48.129
<i>but it's not good reality reality.</i>

07:48.130 --> 07:49.831
The only thing I
love more than hoarders

07:49.832 --> 07:53.902
are people who are too
fat to fit through doors.

07:53.903 --> 07:55.904
Tell me the hoarder has
to grease his sides

07:55.905 --> 07:57.105
to get through the door.

07:57.106 --> 08:01.676
You won't have to get
me a birthday present.

08:01.677 --> 08:05.246
Are you kidding me?

08:05.247 --> 08:09.017
They should charge admission for this.

08:09.018 --> 08:12.854
<i>It's hoarders 3d- The experience.</i>

08:12.855 --> 08:14.989
It's like going to an imax.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.357
It's my max!

08:16.358 --> 08:18.493
ooh!

08:18.494 --> 08:21.630
Save yourself. Go on without me.

08:21.631 --> 08:22.631
Oh, god.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.833
What is that pile over there?

08:24.834 --> 08:26.701
It's hard to tell what is what.

08:26.702 --> 08:29.103
It's either a- An old shag carpet

08:29.104 --> 08:31.640
or a mass grave of dead muppets.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.174
No way. Let's get out of here.

08:33.174 --> 08:35.275
We still have our faces.
Why would we leave?

08:35.277 --> 08:37.779
And besides, you need this money.

08:37.780 --> 08:38.947
Look around.

08:38.948 --> 08:40.448
There might be stuff
here they don't want

08:40.450 --> 08:41.716
that we can sell on ebay.

08:41.717 --> 08:44.152
Look. You know someone's
gonna want a fish tank

08:44.153 --> 08:45.821
full of doll heads.

08:45.822 --> 08:49.524
Yeah, someone with a fish
tank full of doll bodies.

08:49.525 --> 08:52.427
<i>Last year I owned a yacht
named the caroliner,</i>

08:52.428 --> 08:55.029
and now I'm considering
selling doll heads on ebay.

08:55.030 --> 08:57.332
I'll be organizing that
thought in a file in my head

08:57.333 --> 08:59.801
labeled "don't open ever."

08:59.802 --> 09:01.169
Okay.

09:01.170 --> 09:04.739
There's a heavy clown
presence in this room.

09:04.740 --> 09:08.443
It's unsettling,
and I'm obsessed with it.

09:08.444 --> 09:12.113
I want both more and less of the clowns.

09:12.114 --> 09:14.649
Um, hello? Anyone here?

09:14.650 --> 09:17.452
Oh, hey, i'm over here.

09:17.453 --> 09:19.253
I'm sorry. Where?

09:19.254 --> 09:20.689
By the papers.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.390
Which papers?

09:22.391 --> 09:24.325
The papers near the papers.

09:24.326 --> 09:28.864
Oh, my god. I love this!

09:28.865 --> 09:32.734
Um, hi. Caroline? We spoke yesterday.

09:32.735 --> 09:34.235
There's a lot more to organize here

09:34.236 --> 09:35.770
than you led me to believe on the phone,

09:35.771 --> 09:37.839
so we're gonna have to
renegotiate our price.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.908
It's not that bad.

09:39.909 --> 09:41.543
Not that bad?

09:41.544 --> 09:43.512
I was hired to organized some papers,

09:43.513 --> 09:46.180
not clean up katrina.

09:46.181 --> 09:47.682
What's he look like?

09:47.683 --> 09:50.685
Please tell me he needs to
be buried in a piano box.

09:50.686 --> 09:52.888
I don't know. I can't
see him through the truck.

09:52.889 --> 09:55.891
It's an rv, and it's a collectible.

09:55.892 --> 09:59.661
It's where I keep my raisins.

09:59.662 --> 10:02.463
So how much more, then?

10:02.464 --> 10:05.366
Um, a hundred a day. For both of us.

10:05.367 --> 10:08.269
And we get to keep the horse
head made out of soda cans.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.604
Why would we want that?

10:09.605 --> 10:11.006
We don't. It's for chestnut.

10:11.007 --> 10:13.374
Every horse wants a
friend made out of cans.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.109
You got a deal.

10:15.110 --> 10:18.246
Okay. We'll get to work then.

10:18.247 --> 10:20.849
Okay. Let's not get overwhelmed.

10:20.850 --> 10:22.951
We'll take it one step at a time.

10:22.952 --> 10:24.686
Let's start small.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:36.098 --> 10:38.733
Happy birthday to me.

10:46.141 --> 10:49.578
Whoo, max. Well, look at you.

10:49.579 --> 10:52.146
Starting the night at
the end of the night.

10:52.147 --> 10:54.049
This is the first time I've seen you

10:54.050 --> 10:56.685
out of the prison uniform.

10:56.686 --> 10:58.419
You look beautiful.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.789
Oh, earl, let's get married.

11:03.759 --> 11:06.194
What are you staring at?
It's just clothes.

11:06.195 --> 11:08.196
Max, you look like a lady.

11:08.197 --> 11:10.298
Tonight when I dream
of having sex with you,

11:10.299 --> 11:15.336
as always, this time I
will ask you to stay.

11:15.337 --> 11:17.939
Max, you look perfect for your date.

11:17.940 --> 11:20.141
- It's not a date.
- It is.

11:20.142 --> 11:22.243
No, it's not.

11:22.244 --> 11:25.780
It's booty call.

11:25.781 --> 11:28.182
There is a fresh, white billboard.

11:28.183 --> 11:29.383
I'm climbing it with my friend,

11:29.384 --> 11:30.652
and we're putting up his artwork.

11:30.653 --> 11:32.687
Booty call on billboard.

11:32.688 --> 11:34.522
If it's after 2:30,

11:34.523 --> 11:37.291
call is for the dirty.

11:37.292 --> 11:38.660
What's that from?

11:38.661 --> 11:42.864
Dr. Seuss' "oh,
the places you'll put it in"?

11:42.865 --> 11:43.999
Okay, boys, break it up.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.600
Go about your business.
Nothing to see.

11:45.601 --> 11:48.003
Max.

11:48.004 --> 11:51.205
Max and johnny's first date.
So proud.

11:51.206 --> 11:52.573
It's not a date.

11:52.574 --> 11:55.744
Be home at 11:00... a.m.

11:55.745 --> 11:59.547
Uh, max, you got protection?

11:59.548 --> 12:01.016
No, I've got it.

12:01.017 --> 12:04.085
Me too.

12:04.086 --> 12:08.356
Oh, sorry. That is pack of gum.

12:16.732 --> 12:18.767
Can we take these masks off now?

12:18.768 --> 12:23.004
Whoo. It is hot up in that bunny.

12:23.005 --> 12:24.338
Are we wearing these

12:24.339 --> 12:25.740
so no one'll be able to
pick us out of a lineup?

12:25.741 --> 12:27.575
Yeah, that.

12:27.576 --> 12:30.411
And I always wanted to
see a rat with big boobs.

12:30.412 --> 12:34.115
Well, here he is.

12:34.116 --> 12:38.653
All right. Now for the most
crucial part of the art process,

12:38.654 --> 12:40.021
beer break.

12:40.022 --> 12:41.389
That makes sense.

12:41.390 --> 12:43.324
Been here four minutes.

12:43.325 --> 12:46.795
Hmm.

12:46.796 --> 12:50.131
Ooh. Gentleman.

12:50.132 --> 12:53.434
Look over there.
You can see manhattan.

12:53.435 --> 12:54.869
Oh, yeah.

12:54.870 --> 12:57.238
She's a bitch.

12:57.239 --> 12:59.174
Always shoving her stuff in your face.

12:59.175 --> 13:00.608
You can never have it.

13:00.609 --> 13:01.743
Yeah.

13:01.744 --> 13:03.511
I'd never want to live in manhattan.

13:03.512 --> 13:08.049
- 'Cause you can't afford it?
- Yeah.

13:08.050 --> 13:11.419
She is beautiful, though.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.454
Yeah, she is.

13:17.459 --> 13:19.627
Well, we should get back to work.

13:19.628 --> 13:21.529
Bunny's gotta hop.

13:31.220 --> 13:31.220
+

13:35.041 --> 13:36.708
How many more times
do you need to hear it?

13:36.709 --> 13:37.742
He didn't kiss me.

13:37.743 --> 13:39.278
Maybe it wasn't the right time.

13:39.279 --> 13:41.480
Overlooking the new york skyline,

13:41.481 --> 13:43.515
a hundred feet in the air,
bathed in moonlight?

13:43.516 --> 13:45.084
Yeah, that's a crappy time.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.585
Maybe he didn't want to make a move

13:46.586 --> 13:47.986
because he doesn't know you like him.

13:47.987 --> 13:50.655
I leaned in. I leaned for a kiss.

13:50.656 --> 13:52.791
Maybe you had a breath situation.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.059
What did you eat? What had you eaten?

13:54.060 --> 13:55.660
Nothing.

13:55.661 --> 13:57.696
Okay, but sometimes when
you don't eat, it's worse,

13:57.697 --> 13:59.398
because you start to
grind up your feelings.

13:59.399 --> 14:01.633
Then you get stomach breath.

14:01.634 --> 14:04.436
I wouldn't kiss ryan gosling
with stomach breath.

14:04.437 --> 14:07.406
- Yes, you would.
- Yes, I would.

14:07.407 --> 14:10.309
I'm finally making
progress on the papers.

14:10.310 --> 14:14.413
Oh, no, fdr died of polio.

14:14.414 --> 14:19.050
Oh, look. They cured polio.

14:19.051 --> 14:23.888
Jackpot. This place is
a freakin' cat factory.

14:23.889 --> 14:27.859
And they're alive. How refreshing.

14:27.860 --> 14:30.596
There's, like, 45 kittens in this box,

14:30.597 --> 14:33.599
and I think one of these
kittens just had kittens.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.668
Kittens having kittens.

14:36.669 --> 14:38.470
Hey, douglas, we found some kittens.

14:38.471 --> 14:40.839
Those are not my kittens.

14:40.840 --> 14:44.610
Okay. What about this mountain
of butterfinger wrappers?

14:44.611 --> 14:46.411
<i>those are my wrappers.</i>

14:46.412 --> 14:48.046
I need those.

14:48.047 --> 14:51.483
I haven't even seen him yet.
I love this show.

14:51.484 --> 14:53.218
Douglas, if you're comfortable

14:53.219 --> 14:55.887
with me selling all this
sort-of-valuable stuff on ebay,

14:55.888 --> 14:58.890
why do you need to keep a box
full of butterfinger wrappers?

14:58.891 --> 15:01.560
I don't want to think about it!

15:01.561 --> 15:03.462
See, max?

15:03.463 --> 15:05.830
This is what happens when you
don't deal with your feelings.

15:05.831 --> 15:07.966
You start collecting
butterfinger wrappers,

15:07.967 --> 15:09.901
and next thing you know you're
an old lady in a rest home,

15:09.902 --> 15:11.836
and you're thinking
"why didn't he kiss me?"

15:11.837 --> 15:14.973
why didn't he kiss me?

15:14.974 --> 15:17.176
I don't know.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.943
Why didn't you kiss him?

15:18.944 --> 15:21.079
You obviously like him, right?

15:21.080 --> 15:23.515
Max, stop hoarding your feelings.

15:23.516 --> 15:25.184
Just admit that you like him.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.718
I like him.

15:26.719 --> 15:27.952
Okay, good.

15:27.953 --> 15:29.988
There's one box of
butterfinger wrappers gone.

15:29.989 --> 15:32.691
What?

15:32.692 --> 15:35.527
Douglas, it's a metaphor.

15:35.528 --> 15:38.363
So next time you see him,
why don't you just kiss him?

15:38.364 --> 15:40.332
I don't know if I can kiss him first.

15:40.333 --> 15:44.670
Just kiss him already!

15:44.671 --> 15:47.539
Wait, there's another person in here?

15:47.540 --> 15:48.674
Butt out, ma.

15:48.675 --> 15:51.577
Those are my kittens, young lady.

15:51.578 --> 15:54.379
Hold up. He's hoarding
another hoarder in here?

15:54.380 --> 15:57.216
Awesome.

16:01.987 --> 16:03.088
I can't believe you put

16:03.089 --> 16:05.290
the platypus foot rest in the trash.

16:05.291 --> 16:08.093
On ebay we could get at least
three to six dollars for it.

16:08.094 --> 16:09.728
I'm gonna tell you this one more time.

16:09.729 --> 16:13.164
It's a opossum, and it died at
least three to six years ago.

16:13.165 --> 16:15.567
Oh, my god. There's johnny.

16:15.568 --> 16:18.570
This is a katherine heigl movie.

16:18.571 --> 16:24.543
What are you guys doing
in this neighborhood?

16:24.544 --> 16:26.712
Oh, hello. Sorry to interrupt you,

16:26.713 --> 16:28.480
but what the hell's going on here?

16:28.481 --> 16:30.582
This is, uh...

16:30.583 --> 16:32.183
I'm cassandra, his girlfriend.

16:32.184 --> 16:34.553
Who are you?

16:38.558 --> 16:44.129
I'm max, and, um,
that's how I say hi to everyone.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.898
I'm incredibly friendly.

16:46.899 --> 16:50.135
She's so friendly.

16:53.239 --> 16:54.573
Here's table ten, earl.

16:54.574 --> 16:56.275
Are you okay, max?

16:56.276 --> 16:58.443
Rumor has it that you
had your heart broken.

16:58.444 --> 17:00.111
I didn't have my heart broken.

17:00.112 --> 17:03.348
And that's why I
don't listen to rumors.

17:03.349 --> 17:06.451
Max, I want to announce
I have ended my bromance

17:06.452 --> 17:08.185
with your boyfriend, johnny.

17:08.186 --> 17:11.189
I hate the player as well as the game.

17:11.190 --> 17:14.393
Never was my boyfriend.

17:15.560 --> 17:19.631
I would like to offer
myself for rebound sex.

17:19.632 --> 17:22.501
Or, if not, I can just
beat the crap out of him.

17:25.471 --> 17:27.772
Caroline, did you
have to tell everyone?

17:27.773 --> 17:30.409
I'm sorry, but I'm not
keeping that up in my head.

17:30.410 --> 17:32.477
I'm not going butterfingers.

17:35.682 --> 17:38.317
I can't believe he has a girlfriend.

17:38.318 --> 17:39.484
Are you happy now?

17:39.485 --> 17:40.885
You got me to admit that I like him,

17:40.886 --> 17:42.086
and then you got me to kiss him.

17:42.087 --> 17:43.855
And then I kissed his
beautiful girlfriend,

17:43.856 --> 17:45.324
who is black and british,

17:45.325 --> 17:48.627
the two cool things I can never be.

17:48.628 --> 17:50.696
I'm sorry, but he led you on.

17:50.697 --> 17:51.896
Oh, did he?

17:51.897 --> 17:54.165
I think you and douglas'
mother led me on.

17:56.436 --> 17:58.002
This is not my fault.

17:58.003 --> 17:59.904
He's the one who's hoarding women.

18:03.376 --> 18:05.143
Hi.

18:05.144 --> 18:09.080
Yeah, you must be to come back in here.

18:09.081 --> 18:11.149
Can we talk?

18:11.150 --> 18:12.250
Pick up, max.

18:12.251 --> 18:13.251
Table three, table nine.

18:13.252 --> 18:16.120
Table 69.

18:16.121 --> 18:18.490
Not a good time.

18:18.491 --> 18:20.459
- Max, look...
- Johnny, stop.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.860
You don't need to "max, look" me.

18:21.861 --> 18:23.995
It's cool. You never led me on.

18:23.996 --> 18:25.731
You never put your hands on me.

18:25.732 --> 18:28.299
You never even kissed me.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.735
Food!

18:29.736 --> 18:32.203
Hey, better make sure he
doesn't have a girlfriend

18:32.204 --> 18:36.040
who's beautiful, black, and british.

18:36.041 --> 18:38.176
Max, look, I wanted to kiss you.

18:38.177 --> 18:39.344
I want to kiss you.

18:39.345 --> 18:40.912
I just didn't want to
be the guy who did it

18:40.913 --> 18:42.614
when he's with someone else.

18:42.615 --> 18:44.949
Look, max, I didn't know you
were gonna come into my life.

18:44.950 --> 18:47.018
I didn't know I was gonna
have these feelings for you,

18:47.019 --> 18:49.454
but all of a sudden it's "max"
all the time in my head.

18:49.455 --> 18:53.258
Cassandra and I have or-or had something,

18:53.259 --> 18:55.761
and there is or was love there,

18:55.762 --> 18:58.897
and-and I don't know
what I'm supposed to do

18:58.898 --> 19:00.231
with all my feelings for you.

19:00.232 --> 19:02.567
Johnny, I just spent two days

19:02.568 --> 19:04.235
wading through someone else's garbage,

19:04.236 --> 19:07.038
and, quite frankly,
I don't have the time or the energy

19:07.039 --> 19:09.207
to go through all the
clowns and candy wrappers

19:09.208 --> 19:11.410
you've got going on up in there.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.244
And the next time you invite someone

19:13.245 --> 19:14.646
to a booty call on a billboard...

19:14.647 --> 19:16.147
It wasn't a booty call.

19:16.148 --> 19:17.449
I think everyone knows

19:17.450 --> 19:21.453
if it's after 2:30,
the call is for the dirty.

19:21.454 --> 19:24.389
And p.s., we've known
each other six months,

19:24.390 --> 19:26.625
and you never told me
you had a girlfriend.

19:26.626 --> 19:30.729
You should have worn the rat mask.

19:30.730 --> 19:33.164
And that's all she wrote.

19:40.907 --> 19:42.841
Silver lining time?

19:42.842 --> 19:43.942
We didn't have to change

19:43.943 --> 19:46.010
douglas and his mother's diapers?

19:46.011 --> 19:48.179
We made $240 for the cupcake business

19:48.180 --> 19:50.281
selling all that crap on ebay.

19:50.282 --> 19:54.319
Yup. I made some money,
and all I lost was my mind.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.254
Want to hear something
you don't want to hear?

19:56.255 --> 19:59.190
I think what johnny said
to you was beautiful.

19:59.191 --> 20:02.293
You think a squirrel holding
an acorn is beautiful.

20:02.294 --> 20:03.528
He didn't touch you or kiss you

20:03.529 --> 20:05.296
because he didn't want
to start a relationship

20:05.297 --> 20:06.297
with you out of a lie.

20:06.298 --> 20:07.866
You know what? You're right.

20:07.867 --> 20:09.267
You've been right all along.

20:09.268 --> 20:10.669
<i>It is like romeo and juliet.</i>

20:10.670 --> 20:13.839
And now I'm gonna go
home and kill myself.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.140
I don't think romance
is in the cards for me.

20:16.141 --> 20:18.977
I give guys blue balls,
not broken hearts.

20:18.978 --> 20:21.880
Oh, my god. Don't kill
yourself yet, juliet.

20:21.881 --> 20:25.350
I definitely think
romance is in your cards.

20:25.351 --> 20:27.151
That's not me.

20:27.152 --> 20:29.287
That's not his girlfriend.

20:29.288 --> 20:32.190
Come on, will you at least
admit that that's you

20:32.191 --> 20:33.825
and that he put it up there
because he wanted you to see it?

20:33.826 --> 20:36.327
And that's actually incredibly romantic.

20:36.328 --> 20:38.497
Oh, yeah. That's the
most romantic picture

20:38.498 --> 20:39.998
of a guy who might be kissing someone

20:39.999 --> 20:41.332
who might look like me,

20:41.333 --> 20:43.802
but he didn't because he has
a hot british girlfriend

20:43.803 --> 20:45.003
who seems like kind of a bitch,

20:45.004 --> 20:47.205
but is kind of cooler
than I will ever be.

20:47.206 --> 20:50.008
I dare you to organize that thought.

20:50.009 --> 20:52.410
There's no one cooler than you.

20:52.411 --> 20:54.513
You're 200 feet tall.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.582
Yeah, and a bird
just took a crap on me.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.684
Come on.

21:02.221 --> 21:05.023
Come on.

21:05.024 --> 21:10.801
