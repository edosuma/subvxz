02:26.880 --> 02:31.408
We've negotiated the outer epidermis
and the subcutaneous fat layer.

02:32.218 --> 02:36.120
Notice that the incision runs parallel
to the muscle cells.

02:36.289 --> 02:39.019
This is to ensure proper healing.

02:39.626 --> 02:44.495
Continuing with a lateral incision
across the myocardium...

02:44.664 --> 02:48.100
...we expose the chordinae tendinae.

02:48.268 --> 02:53.171
As you can see, premature
ventricular contraction has set in.

02:53.339 --> 02:57.400
And is followed by full cardiac arrest.

02:57.577 --> 03:00.102
Respiration has bottomed out.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.816
All brain function has ceased.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.947
The patient...

03:06.119 --> 03:07.677
...has expired.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.050
You win some, you lose some.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.951
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

03:14.127 --> 03:16.823
...you are about to experience...

03:16.996 --> 03:18.896
...the cutting edge of medicine.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.396
Let's open this baby up
and see what it'll do.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.366
What is it, doc?
It's patient 193.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.477
- Shit, that's Dr. Giggles.
- Who?

03:32.645 --> 03:34.977
It's his nickname.
Nobody knows his real ID.

03:35.148 --> 03:38.515
Delusional, acute schizophrenic
with an IQ somewhere in the stratosphere.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.050
We're talking prodigy.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.778
He thinks he's a...

03:42.422 --> 03:43.855
doctor.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.785
Jesus, what the hell...

03:54.267 --> 03:56.599
Mm, Dr. Philips.

03:57.370 --> 04:01.670
Dr. Philips, this isn't really the place.

04:05.478 --> 04:07.776
He should have kept his hands
to himself.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.298
What the...?

04:26.799 --> 04:28.790
The patients.

04:28.968 --> 04:31.436
He's released the patients.

04:40.513 --> 04:43.710
Laughter is the best medicine.

04:48.921 --> 04:52.220
Mmm. Ha-ha-ha.

05:08.274 --> 05:10.504
- Aah!
- Check-out time.

06:19.679 --> 06:20.771
Hey, Jen.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.642
- Ask me why summer's off to a great start.
- Why is summer off to a great start?

06:25.818 --> 06:27.615
I called Johnson at lunch. I got a job.

06:27.787 --> 06:31.188
Playing old favorites for the locals
at his restaurant every Wednesday.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.415
That's great, Max.

06:32.592 --> 06:34.457
I don't know, my math's pretty shitty...

06:34.627 --> 06:38.586
...but I think that leaves us six nights
of the week to engage in unsafe practices.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.596
Heh. You wish.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.167
Why do I detect a disturbing lack
of jubilation here?

06:43.336 --> 06:46.601
I mean, maybe you haven't heard,
but school's out, you know?

06:46.773 --> 06:49.435
The central government's collapsed.
People are free.

06:49.609 --> 06:52.407
L... I just didn't get much
sleep last night, that's all.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.672
Maybe it's time
for the famous Max Anderson stress test.

06:59.952 --> 07:02.921
I hope you two can breathe
through your ears.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.114
Yeah, as long as you don't plug them off.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.556
First time I've ever been accused
of talking too much.

07:08.728 --> 07:11.925
- You guys know where to meet tonight?
- Eight o'clock, Breeder's Hill.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.856
A fitting name, don't you think?

07:15.601 --> 07:18.502
You know, we might be
a little bit on the tardy side. Heh.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.662
Yeah, we're going on a little expedition.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.671
Expedition? You guys bringing tents?

07:22.842 --> 07:25.402
- No, these guys have a big surprise planned.
- Right.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.671
Speaking of big surprises,
the twin peaks.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.115
Let's climb.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.809
See you guys later.

07:33.986 --> 07:34.975
Party down tonight.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.113
Hi, guys.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.625
I better get going. I gotta stop by
Johnson's and fill out some stuff.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.286
- Okay.
- You sure nothing's wrong?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.525
Yeah.
Pick me up at quarter to eight?

07:48.701 --> 07:50.362
Quarter to eight.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.201
Look up for me.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.851
Now, I want you to sit up straight.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.713
How's your dad doing?
Give me a deep breath.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.656
All right. Again.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.259
Hmm.

08:21.567 --> 08:25.003
When will you know if you need
to you know...

08:25.605 --> 08:26.663
Replace the valve?

08:27.306 --> 08:28.830
Well, it's way too early to tell.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.568
We'll have to wait and see
what we get on the monitor...

08:31.744 --> 08:34.508
...when you come back next week.
- Next week?

08:35.081 --> 08:38.881
Jennifer, don't forget that
a mitral valve prolapse...

08:39.051 --> 08:40.575
...is not that serious.

08:40.753 --> 08:43.187
Even if we have to operate,
we do them all the time.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.514
I'll try to remember that.

08:45.691 --> 08:49.684
It's more important that you remember
to avoid strenuous activity.

08:49.862 --> 08:54.526
No coffee, no tea
and especially no alcohol.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.190
It's all in here.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.270
Anne will show you how to put
the monitor on. I'll see you next week.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.980
Erica, what in the world's
the matter with you?

10:17.149 --> 10:21.051
- Oh. It's okay, Ms. Henderson.
- Hey, that's an odd-looking radio.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.855
- It's... It's not really a radio.
- It isn't?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.518
Well, what is it then?

10:26.392 --> 10:29.657
I'm kind of in a hurry.
Can I talk to you later? Okay?

10:32.398 --> 10:33.387
Hmm.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.735
Hi, Jennifer.
Hi, Billy.

10:57.623 --> 11:00.057
Jen, honey, is that you?

11:06.932 --> 11:08.559
Hi, Daddy.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.031
Hey. Hi, sport. Come on in.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.938
I'm sorry I couldn't get to the doctor.
If I don't upload these figures by 6:00...

11:19.111 --> 11:21.045
...I'm gonna be selling door-to-door.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.147
So, what did Chamberlain say?

11:23.482 --> 11:27.009
Same thing he said last week,
wait and see.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.086
Got a new fashion accessory.

11:29.255 --> 11:33.282
Whoa. Yes, well,
that's a good color for you.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.757
- Thanks.
- Hey, at least school's out.

11:37.129 --> 11:40.098
It might as well be fall.
I can't do anything.

11:40.266 --> 11:44.362
Yeah, I know. But you have to take it easy
or you're not gonna get any better.

11:45.237 --> 11:46.966
I thought dinner was almost ready.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.840
You know what they say,
an apple a day keeps the doctor away.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.406
I know you're worried.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.141
Especially with what happened
to your mother.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.188
It's not that, Daddy.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.946
It's...

12:05.357 --> 12:07.052
It's her.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.215
Tamara?

12:09.161 --> 12:10.355
Oh.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.060
I think you're gonna get to like her.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.927
I think it's gonna take some time.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.042
He's in the den.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.030
Daddy, Daddy.

13:25.204 --> 13:28.071
I wanna be a doctor just like you.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.403
You will someday. I promise.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.050
Yes, yes, I know.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.054
First thing's first.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.265
This town murdered you.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.437
It's sick...

14:01.507 --> 14:03.338
...and must be cured.

14:07.046 --> 14:08.638
This is the surprise?
Shut up.

14:08.814 --> 14:11.942
When are we opening the case?
Beer, right? Whoo-hoo!

14:12.117 --> 14:13.914
All right.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.155
<i>Town's got a doctor</i>

14:20.326 --> 14:21.691
<i>And his name is Rendell.</i>

14:21.861 --> 14:25.456
<i>Stay away from his house
Because he's the doctor from hell.</i>

14:25.631 --> 14:28.759
<i>He chopped up his patients,
Every last one</i>

14:28.934 --> 14:33.064
<i>And he cut up their hearts
Purely for fun.</i>

14:39.278 --> 14:41.075
So just what is this big mystery?

14:41.247 --> 14:42.908
This big mystery?

14:43.082 --> 14:45.778
Remember the facts of the case.

14:45.951 --> 14:48.647
The citizens of Moorehigh
surrounded the house, broke in...

14:48.821 --> 14:51.517
...and they dragged the town doctor
into the streets.

14:51.690 --> 14:54.090
- And they stoned him to death, right?
- That's right.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.354
And then they came in after his son,
but he disappeared.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.929
- Never found him.
- How did Evan get out of the house?

15:00.099 --> 15:02.499
The suspense is killing me.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.698
Well, some say Dr. Rendell cremated him.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.930
- Some say he ate him.
- Oh, sick.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.440
But I think Evan never left the house.
I think he's still here.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.100
Alive.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.781
That way.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.485
What is this?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.152
Shit.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.355
I don't believe this.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.196
This is where we start.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.684
Stu, what are you doing?

15:52.851 --> 15:54.842
He's in the walls.
- He's in the what?

15:55.020 --> 15:57.011
Secret passageways.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.784
Come on, guys. That's how he's managed
to stay hidden for so long. Duh.

16:02.428 --> 16:04.453
Don't just stand there, start banging.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.766
I'm not doing this.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.495
So, what exactly are we listening for?

16:10.669 --> 16:12.068
A hollow sound.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.171
- Through your head.
A hollow sound...

16:14.340 --> 16:16.365
Where are you going?

16:24.483 --> 16:25.609
Hey.

16:31.857 --> 16:36.089
How long are we gonna keep banging
on the walls before we give up this shit?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.157
Stu.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.159
What are you doing? Let us out.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.158
Stu, let me out.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.274
Are you sure they're gonna be all right?

16:52.444 --> 16:54.378
Sure, as long as
they don't wake up Evan.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.776
All they gotta worry about
is what to do with each other.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.922
Oh, fuck. Uhn!

17:04.089 --> 17:05.784
Fucking door.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.050
Oh, I think it's dislocated.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.984
Oh, this is just great. Real mature.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.686
This was your idea, wasn't it?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.263
- My idea?
- Yeah, your idea.

17:14.433 --> 17:18.267
You made up this whole bogus expedition
just to get us alone in the dark, right?

17:18.436 --> 17:20.837
You aren't getting any,
so you're wasting your time.

17:21.006 --> 17:23.634
- That offends me.
- Oh, yeah? Then get me out of here.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.334
Trotter, I'm telling you
just get me out of here and...

17:26.512 --> 17:29.572
Just get me out of here...

17:29.748 --> 17:32.342
...and maybe you will get something.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.184
Whew.

18:15.994 --> 18:19.395
Get ready to take your medicine,
Moorehigh.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.795
The doctor is in.

18:35.013 --> 18:36.776
That butt head.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.045
[FOOTSTEPS

18:40.219 --> 18:41.811
What's he doing?

18:41.987 --> 18:43.648
He's just trying to make us nervous.

18:43.822 --> 18:46.256
He's doing a good job of it.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.853
Stu.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.421
Stu, this is stupid.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.721
I don't like this.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.058
Come on.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.896
Don't you notice a classic Stuism
when you hear one?

18:59.838 --> 19:02.500
That does not sound like Stu.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.085
Come on, who else could it be?

19:16.855 --> 19:20.154
Stu.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.686
Stu.

19:23.195 --> 19:26.824
- Aah!
- Trotter, what's wrong? What's wrong?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.931
What happened? Let me see.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.239
That is not funny, you asshole.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.668
That's not funny.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.138
Get me out of here.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.299
I was just joking.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.704
You're so full of shit.

19:51.456 --> 19:53.515
Trotter. Trotter get up.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.105
I'm not really seeing patients yet...

20:13.979 --> 20:16.743
...but I guess I can make an exception.

20:43.942 --> 20:45.603
Hello?

20:48.981 --> 20:51.211
Anyone in here?

20:54.653 --> 20:56.917
Is anybody in there?

20:57.789 --> 21:00.587
Well, I'm gonna call the police.

21:20.312 --> 21:21.336
Hmm.

21:48.707 --> 21:51.301
I know.
Way to chug, babe.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.110
I remember riding the Ferris wheel
when I was a little kid.

22:00.285 --> 22:02.845
We'd stop at the top
and I could see all the big kids...

22:03.021 --> 22:05.012
...parked on the hill where we are now.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.454
I wanted to be with the big kids so bad.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.386
Yeah, well,
now you are with the big kids.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.757
You know, Max,
I'm really not that thirsty.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.402
Hey, what's thirst got to do with it?

22:18.570 --> 22:20.731
I just don't wanna drink right now, okay?

22:20.906 --> 22:23.136
Come on, why do we have to get drunk
to have fun?

22:23.308 --> 22:26.141
We don't have to get drunk,
but it's a damn good start.

22:26.311 --> 22:28.279
Well, not for me.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.742
Hey.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.543
Trouble in paradise?

22:44.529 --> 22:47.123
Shit.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.831
Hey, the party's moving to the bash.

22:50.001 --> 22:52.265
It's every man for himself.

22:53.071 --> 22:55.403
Most of you are probably
too wet behind the ears...

22:55.574 --> 22:57.337
...to remember this old chartbuster.

22:57.509 --> 23:00.501
Judy Holliday made it famous
way back in 1960...

23:00.679 --> 23:03.546
...when I would have been
just old enough to join you.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.704
And it's called...

23:04.883 --> 23:07.545
..."The Party's Over".

23:09.287 --> 23:12.984
That's right, the party's over.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.558
Good night, officer. Asshole.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.820
Now, Officer Magruder is gonna wind up.

23:17.996 --> 23:19.588
Anyone still on the premises...

23:19.765 --> 23:23.895
...will be partying in beautiful,
recently repainted Moorehigh lockup.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.229
Whoo-hoo!

23:25.404 --> 23:27.167
You mind if I turn this noise off now?

23:32.778 --> 23:33.938
You live for that shit.

23:35.814 --> 23:38.749
Ooh. Magruder's raid on Breeder's Hill...

23:38.917 --> 23:40.714
...that's a Moorehigh tradition, son.

23:40.886 --> 23:43.116
You got any other traditions
I should know about?

23:43.288 --> 23:47.281
<i>Unit 3, possible 3- 11
at 5714 Tivoli Court.</i>

23:47.459 --> 23:49.654
<i>Please respond, code two.</i>

23:49.828 --> 23:51.853
10-4, station.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.792
You're asking about
Moorehigh traditions?

23:55.967 --> 23:59.027
Ten-to-one Elaine Henderson
called that in.

23:59.204 --> 24:02.401
That crazy broad sees rapists
in her hemorrhoid cream.

24:14.252 --> 24:18.814
Erica, when are you gonna figure out
how to use the doggy door?

24:19.591 --> 24:20.922
Come on, come on.

24:21.092 --> 24:22.491
And stop barking.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.788
You're gonna lose your voice again.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.468
Get in bed, Erica.

24:38.577 --> 24:41.375
The cops never come
when you want them.

25:09.908 --> 25:13.969
Operator, I need a doctor.

25:24.222 --> 25:25.780
It's a good thing I make house calls.

25:38.937 --> 25:42.270
These things happen
when you neglect your regular checkups.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.998
Now...

25:44.175 --> 25:47.838
...open wide and say, "Ah. "

25:48.013 --> 25:49.640
Uh. Uh. Uh.

25:49.814 --> 25:51.042
No, "Ah. "

25:51.383 --> 25:53.374
Ah!

25:54.352 --> 25:55.546
Mm-hm.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.978
Let's have a look at that nose.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.028
A good physician...

26:06.197 --> 26:09.724
...always has the right instrument
for the job.

26:12.771 --> 26:18.232
Now, now. This won't hurt a bit.

26:25.150 --> 26:27.948
Hmm. I think I found the problem.

26:31.189 --> 26:32.281
So this is her.

26:32.457 --> 26:35.426
Some of the guys back at the station
warned me about this place.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.188
Yeah? What did they say?

26:38.363 --> 26:40.297
They didn't get into much detail.

26:42.400 --> 26:46.996
Surprise is the kind of detail
most people around here rather forget.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.900
Well, I've always had a way of figuring
things out by what people don't say.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.266
I think that's called...

26:53.445 --> 26:55.436
...reading between the lines.
- Mm-hm.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.689
So this guy was a doctor?

27:04.856 --> 27:08.348
Yeah, Evan Rendell.
He was the town doctor.

27:08.660 --> 27:11.220
He offed seven of his patients.

27:12.263 --> 27:15.289
Cut out their hearts
while they were still alive.

27:15.467 --> 27:19.460
Shit. What would make a guy
crack like that?

27:19.638 --> 27:23.438
His wife took sick. Heart problems.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.843
He was trying to save her.

27:26.011 --> 27:29.742
Somewhere along the line
old doc just suddenly threw a piston.

27:30.915 --> 27:33.543
The sicker she got, the crazier he got.

27:33.718 --> 27:36.585
One day, folks just started disappearing.

27:36.755 --> 27:38.848
Seems he was trying to find his wife
a new ticker.

27:40.291 --> 27:43.260
Well, who knows,
if they hadn't killed him...

27:43.428 --> 27:46.420
...maybe he'd have pulled off
the world's first heart transplant.

27:46.598 --> 27:49.829
Ahead of his time, but out of his mind.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.836
It's ugly business clearing all that up.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.415
Reitz.

28:05.850 --> 28:06.942
It's nothing.

28:07.118 --> 28:09.109
Didn't he have a son?

28:10.088 --> 28:13.023
Wasn't his kid involved
in helping the father out or something?

28:13.191 --> 28:14.681
That's what they say.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.885
There was this big mystery.
How did the kid get out of the house?

28:18.063 --> 28:20.361
That's what they say.

28:20.665 --> 28:22.360
What do you say?

28:22.534 --> 28:23.558
I don't say.

28:31.076 --> 28:34.739
Mm-mm. I'm not going up that staircase,
not until I drop another 30 pounds...

28:34.913 --> 28:37.711
...and that ain't gonna be for a long time.

28:38.516 --> 28:39.881
Do you smell that?

28:40.051 --> 28:41.416
What?

28:41.619 --> 28:45.020
Smells like rubbing alcohol.

28:45.190 --> 28:48.489
No, I don't smell nothing.
Come on, I gotta make a pit stop.

29:00.171 --> 29:03.971
Hey. Hey, come on, let's go.

29:19.124 --> 29:20.648
How serious is it?

29:21.092 --> 29:24.550
Well, the doctor says
it isn't very serious at all.

29:24.729 --> 29:26.890
But depending on what
this piece of junk says...

29:27.065 --> 29:30.159
...they might have to
operate to fix the valve.

29:30.335 --> 29:31.768
Operate?

29:32.504 --> 29:33.835
Yeah.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.832
They're telling me
it's a routine operation.

29:37.008 --> 29:39.203
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

29:40.211 --> 29:42.338
I didn't want you to feel sorry for me.

29:42.814 --> 29:45.408
Shit, Jen, you know, I'm your boyfriend.

29:45.583 --> 29:50.111
We're supposed to face things like this
together. Remember, you and me?

29:51.289 --> 29:52.950
I love you.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.659
There's something else.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.360
It's about my mom.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.559
I never told you the way she died.

30:05.270 --> 30:09.536
She went into the hospital
for a routine operation.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.541
I never saw her again.

30:13.511 --> 30:15.069
Jen, I'm sorry.

30:16.281 --> 30:19.739
I had nightmares for the longest time...

30:19.918 --> 30:22.546
...and after a while, they went away.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.585
But now they're back.

30:25.623 --> 30:28.683
Okay, folks, exit to the right.
Watch your step.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.953
Listen to me, some hero, huh?

30:31.129 --> 30:34.792
My mom died and all I talk about
is stupid nightmares.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.957
I don't give a shit about anyone
but myself.

30:37.135 --> 30:38.602
That's not true.

30:38.770 --> 30:43.537
My dad's trying to get on with his life
and all I do is bitch and moan.

30:47.145 --> 30:50.410
I'm sorry, Max. I gotta be alone tonight.

31:16.374 --> 31:19.366
Oh, yeah. Don't stop.

31:22.547 --> 31:27.507
Oh, baby. You are king. You are king.

31:34.692 --> 31:38.924
Sorry, guys. Guess I'm destined
to screw up everyone's night.

31:57.949 --> 31:59.348
Hey, wait up.

32:38.456 --> 32:42.586
Swiped it from my mom's suitcase
before she and Dad left for vacation.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.655
You expect me to wear this?

32:45.830 --> 32:50.563
Look, right now, my mom's probably
pretty pissed off, not to mention my dad.

32:50.735 --> 32:54.171
Don't let their pain be in vain.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.803
Okay.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.001
But if I'm dressing up...

33:03.214 --> 33:05.148
<i>:::so are you:</i>

33:06.651 --> 33:10.143
- Where did you get this?
- They pass them out in gym class.

33:10.621 --> 33:12.816
I must have skipped.

33:22.300 --> 33:25.827
Guess I'll go and powder up.

33:58.669 --> 34:00.660
Shit.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.418
Ready.

34:24.594 --> 34:26.824
I'm coming, I'm coming.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.998
Could it possibly be any colder in here?

34:56.893 --> 34:58.953
Sixty-five?

34:59.397 --> 35:01.831
These people are Eskimos.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.370
Shh-shh-shh.

35:10.875 --> 35:14.140
You'll catch your death of cold
running around like this.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.977
I think we should take your temperature.

35:18.149 --> 35:23.018
Now, don't make a sound.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.949
There's a good girl.

35:28.726 --> 35:29.818
Tongue up.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.461
Lucky for you, I've discovered
the only known cure for the common cold.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.809
Leave it in for at least a minute.

35:56.554 --> 35:59.523
Maybe she won't notice.

36:13.771 --> 36:17.298
Ready or not, here I come.

36:28.553 --> 36:29.986
You know...

36:30.154 --> 36:34.386
...ever since I found
my mom's Victoria's Secrets catalogue...

36:35.226 --> 36:38.753
...I have been dying for this.

36:50.741 --> 36:53.335
I hope you have protection.

37:18.502 --> 37:19.901
Hmm.

37:20.371 --> 37:21.599
Hmm.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.310
Terminal.

38:46.957 --> 38:49.221
- Oh, Jennifer's home.
- No.

38:49.393 --> 38:51.987
No, I just wanna see if she's okay.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.623
She's never okay.

38:54.799 --> 38:57.199
Come on, she needs time to adjust.

38:57.368 --> 39:01.202
I mean, the girl is sick.
She just lost her mother, for God's sake.

39:01.372 --> 39:05.536
You just lost your wife, you've adjusted.

39:06.444 --> 39:08.139
I'll be right back.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.580
Hey, Jen.

39:27.631 --> 39:29.656
What the...

39:32.303 --> 39:34.134
Jennifer?

39:45.883 --> 39:47.350
- What's the matter?
- Oh.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.042
Sorry.

39:49.453 --> 39:50.681
Jennifer was here.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.584
We have to go look for her.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.824
Look for her where?

39:54.992 --> 39:57.460
I don't know. The fair.
Something is wrong.

39:57.628 --> 39:59.892
I found her heart monitor,
she'd been drinking.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.431
- Right where she wanted you to find it.
- What are you talking about?

40:03.601 --> 40:06.661
She's trying to tear us apart.
Don't you see that?

40:06.837 --> 40:11.069
All I can see is that my daughter is sick
and that she might be in trouble.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.766
So are you coming or not?

40:13.811 --> 40:16.939
No. I'm not.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.218
If Jennifer comes back,
you tell her to stay here.

40:24.355 --> 40:25.822
Unbelievable.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.819
Hey, Max.

40:58.989 --> 41:00.957
Where's Jennifer?

41:01.158 --> 41:03.649
I don't know, we got separated.

41:04.195 --> 41:08.529
So you hear about that top secret bash
going on over in the main building?

41:09.633 --> 41:11.760
We were just gonna crash it.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.733
Do you wanna come?

41:15.639 --> 41:18.267
Sure. Why the hell not?

41:59.884 --> 42:01.818
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

42:03.053 --> 42:04.850
All that fat.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.554
All that sugar.

42:09.426 --> 42:12.361
We've got to start taking better care
of ourselves.

42:13.297 --> 42:15.629
Remember, we are what we eat.

42:16.433 --> 42:18.401
But not to worry.

42:19.436 --> 42:22.030
We'll get it out of your system.

42:28.512 --> 42:30.241
They have a saying.

42:33.817 --> 42:35.307
What goes down...

42:36.921 --> 42:38.115
...must come up.

42:47.798 --> 42:48.992
I know, I know.

42:50.768 --> 42:51.962
It sucks.

43:04.281 --> 43:08.240
First of all,
you gotta use the right fingerings.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.144
There.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.027
Okay, now, you just gotta...

43:18.195 --> 43:21.653
...blow the thing right there.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.352
- You just can't blow it like that.
- Why not?

43:44.488 --> 43:46.888
Oh, you gotta use the right embouchure.

43:47.057 --> 43:48.319
What's that?

43:48.492 --> 43:51.393
It's the way you place your, uh, lips.

43:51.562 --> 43:54.725
I've never had a problem
with my lips before.

43:55.165 --> 43:58.396
Maybe you better show me
what I'm doing wrong.

44:28.832 --> 44:29.890
Heart problems.

44:31.869 --> 44:33.461
Heart.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.908
It's your heart.

44:40.544 --> 44:43.138
Just a broken heart.

45:13.544 --> 45:14.977
Ooh.

45:29.860 --> 45:31.760
Just like mother.

45:34.431 --> 45:35.796
No.

45:36.834 --> 45:39.029
Moorehigh can wait.

45:40.337 --> 45:42.464
I wanna make you proud.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.602
I want to carry on your work.

46:18.509 --> 46:20.568
Looking for someone?

46:21.712 --> 46:23.703
Yeah, Max.

46:25.182 --> 46:27.446
I think I can help you.

46:41.498 --> 46:43.022
I guess I should thank you, Max.

46:44.234 --> 46:45.758
Jen?

46:46.937 --> 46:48.336
Fuck.

46:48.505 --> 46:51.633
At least now I know which one of us
is really sick.

47:43.994 --> 47:45.552
Jen.

48:07.117 --> 48:09.085
Jen.

48:13.056 --> 48:15.251
Jen.

48:16.126 --> 48:20.119
Jennifer come out, I saw you come in here.
Just let me talk to you.

48:25.636 --> 48:27.627
Leave me alone.

48:30.007 --> 48:31.440
Jennifer.

48:34.311 --> 48:36.836
You broke my heart, Max.

48:40.250 --> 48:43.481
And some things just can't be fixed.

48:46.256 --> 48:48.247
Jennifer, wait.

48:49.159 --> 48:50.751
Max.

48:51.561 --> 48:53.995
Oh! Shit.

48:57.534 --> 49:00.833
Oh. This is just choice.

49:01.004 --> 49:02.938
Now I'm bleeding.

49:05.108 --> 49:06.905
Have an accident?

49:07.711 --> 49:10.179
Probably just needs a Band-Aid.

49:15.319 --> 49:17.082
Max?

49:23.794 --> 49:25.523
Max?

49:26.596 --> 49:30.828
Max, if you're screwing around,
this is a really stupid time.

49:44.414 --> 49:46.109
Max?

49:58.929 --> 50:00.260
Don't worry.

50:00.430 --> 50:02.694
- It's ouchless.
- Ah!

50:09.339 --> 50:10.397
Trust me.

50:11.742 --> 50:12.766
I'm a doctor.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.381
- Whoa!
- What happened? What's the matter?

50:25.555 --> 50:27.079
- It's Coreen.
- What?

50:30.227 --> 50:33.094
Jennifer, get out! Run!

51:20.944 --> 51:23.469
Are you feeling any discomfort?

51:25.649 --> 51:26.809
No!

51:32.923 --> 51:34.447
Ohh.

51:45.902 --> 51:49.269
Help! Ms. Henderson, help me.

52:00.817 --> 52:03.411
What in the hell are you doing?

52:04.554 --> 52:06.351
- He's trying to kill me.
- Who?

52:06.523 --> 52:08.286
A doctor.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.994
I'm telling you,
there was someone after her.

52:21.171 --> 52:22.638
I know, I know, a doctor.

52:22.806 --> 52:26.003
There's one doctor in this town
and I've known since he was your age.

52:26.176 --> 52:28.440
He looked like a doctor,
I don't know what he was.

52:28.612 --> 52:30.204
Maybe he just thinks he's a doctor.

52:30.380 --> 52:32.940
Maybe he wanted to be a doctor
and never got the chance.

52:33.116 --> 52:34.276
How's that?

52:34.451 --> 52:36.043
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

52:36.219 --> 52:39.416
...but has anyone here considered
this guy might be Dr. Rendell's son?

52:39.589 --> 52:41.750
Not anyone who is serious
about keeping his job.

52:41.925 --> 52:45.656
Why don't you go back and take 10.
I'll call you when your parents get here.

52:45.829 --> 52:48.320
Come on, buddy.
- Promise me you'll look after her.

52:48.498 --> 52:50.693
I don't have to promise you
doodly squat.

52:50.867 --> 52:52.198
Have we heard from the fair?

52:52.369 --> 52:54.929
Bill found the broken glass,
no dead girl.

52:55.105 --> 52:56.436
I don't doubt it, chief.

52:57.874 --> 53:00.468
Did you get a whiff for those kids?

53:00.644 --> 53:03.807
- They were having too much fun.
- You saying they both imagined it?

53:03.980 --> 53:06.073
I finished checking on her.
- How is she?

53:06.249 --> 53:09.218
She's stable, but I wanna take her
to the office, put her on the EKG.

53:09.386 --> 53:10.819
Sure thing.

53:10.987 --> 53:14.115
Oh, and if you see any of your
fellow marauding doctors out there...

53:14.291 --> 53:16.259
...you'll let us know.
Why the EKG?

53:16.426 --> 53:17.950
She has a heart condition.

53:18.128 --> 53:19.720
Could become serious.

53:19.896 --> 53:21.887
Dr. Rendell's wife
died of a heart problem.

53:22.065 --> 53:23.760
So did my mama, daddy and grandpa.

53:23.934 --> 53:25.663
How did we get back into Dr. Rendell?

53:25.835 --> 53:29.271
Hold it in, chief. My new partner here
just got a little bump on the head.

53:29.439 --> 53:31.566
That has nothing to do with it
and you know it.

53:31.741 --> 53:33.572
- Nor does Dr. Rendell.
That's enough.

53:33.743 --> 53:35.335
- Look...
- I said that's enough...

53:35.512 --> 53:37.673
...or you'll be handing out
parking tickets.

53:37.847 --> 53:41.078
Listen, these kids are pulling
your chain. Relax.

53:41.251 --> 53:44.880
Oh, why don't you go and see
if you can catch the girl's father.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.250
I'll leave a message
in case he beats you there.

53:47.424 --> 53:49.324
- Sure thing, chief.
- Reitz, station duty.

53:49.492 --> 53:52.484
And next time,
wear your seatbelt a little tighter.

53:53.763 --> 53:55.060
Magruder.

53:55.498 --> 53:56.829
Magruder.

53:58.802 --> 54:01.236
You smelled something
in the Rendell house, didn't you?

54:01.404 --> 54:03.497
I didn't smell nothing.
- You saw that girl.

54:03.673 --> 54:05.538
She was fucking scared to death.

54:05.709 --> 54:08.303
That little girl probably
just had too much to drink.

54:08.478 --> 54:10.343
It happens to the best of us.

54:10.513 --> 54:13.448
And what about the boy, huh?
Did he have too much to drink?

54:13.617 --> 54:15.881
- Let go of me.
- Not until you level with me.

54:16.052 --> 54:18.077
I'm going to level you if you don't let go.

54:18.255 --> 54:21.816
Do what you feel, but it might be easier
to just tell me what you're hiding.

54:21.992 --> 54:24.517
Is it Rendell's son?

54:28.531 --> 54:30.089
I'm sorry.

54:48.251 --> 54:51.846
I haven't opened this bottle for 35 years.

54:54.824 --> 54:58.590
I haven't had a drink
in all that time either.

55:00.030 --> 55:01.588
How come?

55:03.500 --> 55:06.367
I'm your partner, man. Tell me.

55:09.606 --> 55:12.074
It was 1957.

55:12.442 --> 55:15.434
The night after they found all the bodies.

55:16.713 --> 55:19.546
All the other officers were gone.

55:20.850 --> 55:24.115
<i>The mob had already offed Dr. Rendell...</i>

55:24.287 --> 55:27.085
<i>...but the search was still on for Evan Jr.</i>

55:28.425 --> 55:32.725
<i>We'd moved all of Rendell victims
out of the house...</i>

55:33.663 --> 55:37.690
<i>...and I was left alone
to watch over the bodies.</i>

55:38.935 --> 55:42.769
<i>I don't need to tell you,
I was plenty spooked.</i>

55:43.740 --> 55:47.574
<i>Thank God for Mr. Moon Glo.</i>

55:50.747 --> 55:53.181
<i>It was around midnight when I heard it.</i>

56:33.556 --> 56:35.353
Who is in here?

57:25.775 --> 57:27.766
<i>And I watched him come out.</i>

57:29.112 --> 57:31.046
<i>It was like he was being born again.</i>

57:31.948 --> 57:35.315
<i>That was how Dr. Rendell got his son
out of the house.</i>

57:35.485 --> 57:39.444
<i>He'd sewn him up
in what was left of his wife's corpse.</i>

57:40.356 --> 57:41.687
Ahh.

57:45.862 --> 57:49.525
And when I came to,
little Evan was gone.

57:49.933 --> 57:52.094
Everything's clean.

57:52.368 --> 57:54.563
It was like it never happened.

57:54.938 --> 57:57.930
Evan's mom was even sewed back up.

57:59.843 --> 58:03.779
Jesus, this is a major league
fucked-up town.

58:05.315 --> 58:07.647
Why haven't you told anyone?

58:09.886 --> 58:12.684
Who'd believe a 20-year-old kid
under too much pressure...

58:12.856 --> 58:15.381
...and too much Moon Glo?

58:20.663 --> 58:23.894
<i>Our town has a doctor</i>

58:24.334 --> 58:27.030
<i>And his name is Rendell.</i>

58:27.704 --> 58:31.936
<i>Stay away from his house,
He's a doctor from hell.</i>

58:32.442 --> 58:36.139
<i>Chopped up his patients,
Every last one.</i>

58:36.312 --> 58:40.715
<i>And cut out their hearts
Purely for fun.</i>

58:41.017 --> 58:44.214
<i>So if you're from Moorehigh
And you should get sick.</i>

58:44.654 --> 58:48.590
<i>Then fall on your knees
And pray you die quick.</i>

58:49.726 --> 58:52.627
Don't go chasing nursery rhymes, Reitz.

59:06.743 --> 59:08.574
<i>Hi, you've reached
the Campbell residence.</i>

59:08.745 --> 59:10.235
<i>- Neither I...
- Or Jennifer.</i>

59:10.413 --> 59:12.005
<i>Can come to the phone right now.</i>

59:12.181 --> 59:14.581
<i>Please leave a message
and we'll call you right back.</i>

59:14.751 --> 59:16.616
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

59:16.786 --> 59:18.014
<i>Hello, Mr. Campbell?</i>

59:18.187 --> 59:20.951
<i>This is Chief Harper
at the Moorehigh Station on West Street.</i>

59:21.124 --> 59:23.615
<i>Would you please call me
concerning your daughter.</i>

59:23.793 --> 59:25.954
<i>She's safe here with us,
not in any trouble.</i>

59:26.129 --> 59:31.089
<i>I'm at 555-9122 extension 3. Thanks.</i>

59:52.522 --> 59:54.285
Jennifer?

59:56.926 --> 59:58.120
Jen?

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.761
Tamara?

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:08.162
Tamara? Now where the hell did you go?

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:21.112
<i>Hello, Mr. Campbell? This is Sheriff Harper
at the Moorehigh Station on West Street.</i>

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.844
<i>Please call me when you get in
concerning your daughter.</i>

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.318
<i>She's safe here with us.
She's not in any trouble.</i>

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:31.085
<i>I'm at 555-9122 extension 3. Thanks.</i>

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:36.930
<i>Hello, this is your new doctor
and I'm standing right behind you.</i>

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.795
Now, what the hell is that?

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:49.341
If you think that's bad,
wait until you get my bill.

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.955
Mr. Campbell?

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:09.595
Mr. Campbell?

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.756
Mother of God.

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:45.956
Oh, my God.

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:58.538
You owe me 35 years of sleep.

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:01.241
You sick son of a bitch.

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:28.843
This is gonna take about 40 minutes.

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.802
You try to relax.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.278
I'll be right in the next room, okay?

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:42.553
<i>Unit 13...</i>

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.886
- Is Jennifer okay?
- Yeah, she's with the doctor.

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.894
- The doctor?
- Dr. Chamberlain, the girl's okay.

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:49.429
You believe us, don't you?

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.793
Why you grabbing me?

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.298
Don't you?

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:55.631
Let's just say I'm getting there.
Grab a seat.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.609
What are you doing?

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.973
Chasing nursery rhymes.

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:20.093
Scalpel.

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.645
Oooh. Oh.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:43.581
That smarts. Oh.

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.482
Retractor.

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:48.679
Suction.

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.234
Forceps.

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.720
Prepare to close.

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:28.790
Physician, heal thyself.

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:31.324
Just how long are you gonna sit there?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.365
As long as it takes.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.766
We're scanning every felony
in a radius of...

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:38.372
Why the fuck am I telling you? Tss.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:45.240
This guy's out there, Reitz, I saw him.
He's out there.

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:51.211
You may be right.

01:04:51.787 --> 01:04:52.776
Tarawood.

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.865
Escaped from Tarawood State Hospital
two weeks ago.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:07.628
A 42-year old male schizophrenic.

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:10.101
Killed three hospital personnel.

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:13.572
ID unknown, orphaned at age 7.

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.443
He's 40. That means born in 1952...

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:20.605
...and orphaned in 1959.

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:22.648
What does all this mean?

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:26.515
I doubt I could convince anyone else,
but I'm taking another look at that house.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.054
- I'm going.
- Like hell you are.

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:30.522
Sit down and wait for your parents.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.093
Like hell I'm not.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:44.298
Hello. Is this Chief Harper?

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:48.569
This is Joe Campbell, Jennifer's father.

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.504
I see.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.147
I'm on my way.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.669
Dr. Chamberlain.

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.965
Dr. Chamberlain!

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.802
You're supposed to be relaxing.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.640
The machine.

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:33.019
I'm sorry, Jennifer.
I'm afraid we have to go in.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:39.160
Dr. Chamberlain, what are you doing?

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.989
Don't worry, Jennifer.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.097
It's just a routine operation.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.174
Jennifer, Jennifer. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:54.775
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:57.708
You're in my office, everything's fine,
you had a nightmare.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.438
Come on, sit up.

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:02.681
Take a deep breath.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.376
You all right?

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:07.445
Let me just check the readout, okay?

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:17.231
Well, up until just now,
things looked pretty good.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.801
Wave patterns seem to be just about
where they should be.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.165
I think you're gonna be fine.

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.639
If I were you, I'd get a second opinion.

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:37.175
Well, here we are.

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:43.858
Jennifer.

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:46.425
My problem is...

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:51.656
...I care too much.

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.140
This isn't happening.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:13.081
That is very unprofessional of you,
doctor.

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.280
- Stay away from her.
- Still...

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:19.189
...I'm not above showing
a little professional courtesy.

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:24.961
How about a free examination?

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:31.728
Shh.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.978
Reflexes seem normal.

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:45.910
Let's check the blood pressure.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:52.124
Oh!

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:56.795
Now...

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.456
...relax and breathe normally.

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:05.270
I'm afraid the news is bad.

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:08.233
I give you six seconds to live.

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:09.899
Any last words, doctor?

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:26.551
Either you're dead
or my watch has stopped.

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:32.332
Lights out. Doctor's orders.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:44.277
Hmm.

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.577
Oh.

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:24.010
Oh, shit.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:39.227
- Doctor.
- I'm calling the hospital now.

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:41.801
No, no, no...

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.497
A doctor...

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:48.267
...did this.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.818
And how are we feeling?

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.486
Just relax.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:37.553
It'll all be over before you know it.

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:44.564
- No.
- No need to be shy around me, young lady.

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:55.610
Oh, sorry. These things get cold.

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.581
It's broken all right.

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:34.570
Never a nurse around
when you need one.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:42.205
Too small.

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.857
Too big.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.331
Hmm.

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:00.632
Just right.

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.138
Shit.

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.896
My father finished this
after my mother died.

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.071
He never got to use it.

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:40.401
It was too late.

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:43.844
You'll be the first, Jennifer.

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:10.996
You see, Jennifer...

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:14.006
...before we can replace
the broken heart...

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.535
...we have to stop it from beating.

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:18.304
Plain...

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.036
...and simple.

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:34.152
There will be no medication,
just a single jolt of electricity.

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.564
It's a necessary step.

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:43.426
I promise.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.404
You may be having second thoughts...

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.510
...but when you wake up...

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:51.771
...you'll have a change of heart.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.141
Don't move.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.842
- I don't believe you had an appointment.
- Get the fuck away from her.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.747
Have a heart.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.244
Ah!

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.509
Shit.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.515
One, two.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:27.707
Time to do what doctors do best.

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:38.282
Four, five, six, seven, eight...

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:40.978
...nine, 10, 11, 12.

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:53.666
Help.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.359
Shh. I'm Officer Reitz, okay?

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:56.561
Listen to me.

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.603
I'm going to get you out of here...

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:01.265
...but first,
I'm gonna make sure it's clear.

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:03.172
Now, I need your help, kid.

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.813
I need you to be quiet and don't move.

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:07.915
I'll be right back.

01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:57.664
Officer Reitz.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.562
Stay there, okay? Don't move.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.535
Jen.
- Jeez.

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.666
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.365
It's all right.

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.773
I'm sorry.

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:14.205
Look, we don't have no time for this shit.
Come on.

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:17.112
Let's go. I got you.

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:18.985
- What happened here?
- Just move.

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:21.311
Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:31.324
Don't look, Jen, just shut your
eyes, okay? Just shut your eyes.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.560
Jen, are you okay?

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:35.760
Shit.

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:37.438
Get up, come on.

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:41.298
I'm getting you out of here, Jen, okay?

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:42.807
Getting out of here.

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.639
Cover your eyes.

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:46.808
Max.

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:48.950
- Visiting hours are over.
- Ah!

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:20.480
Should have used an eight iron.

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:24.413
Ah!

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.850
You know what happens
when children play with guns?

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:32.482
No!

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:38.064
Over here, motherfucker.

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:52.268
Come on, Max. Max.

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:55.276
Max, come on.

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:22.009
This is going to hurt you
more than it hurts me.

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.138
No.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:08.954
Ah!

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:22.460
I haven't discharged you.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.470
Max?

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:34.376
We can still make it.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:03.836
Don't make me laugh.

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:11.917
Grab my hand.

01:23:29.437 --> 01:23:31.530
I can't hold on.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.777
I've never lost a patient, Jennifer.

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:58.855
Jennifer!

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:48.514
I can't breathe, Max.

01:24:57.692 --> 01:25:01.423
<i>Dr. Alfred and Dr. Jones, to O.R. Stat.</i>

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:04.087
The strain was too much on the valve.

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:08.031
Administer pre-surgical meds
and have an O.R. Ready immediately.

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.676
Okay, Jennifer. Scoot over, please.

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:14.498
Oh, my God.

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:19.496
Okay, honey. Here we go.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:32.246
Now, I want you to count
backwards, slowly from 100.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.049
One hundred, 99, 98...

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:38.522
...ninety seven, 96.

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:42.762
Who the hell are you?

01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:48.902
I'm her doctor.

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.594
What in God's name are those?

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:20.930
Just a little something I threw together.

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:24.663
Of course, they haven't been tested yet.

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:40.009
You were dead.

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:42.112
I'm not that good a doctor.

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:46.418
Jennifer, there's still time.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:49.959
Let's pick up where we left off.

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:35.139
Is it my bedside manners?

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:40.514
Jennifer, it's time to take your medicine.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:44.914
Try some of your own medicine.

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:55.694
Ah!

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:05.833
Ahh.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.595
Huhn!
- Ah!

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:40.907
I don't feel well.

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:43.176
Take two and call me in the morning.

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:45.312
- Uh-huh-huh?
- Uhn!

01:29:56.991 --> 01:30:00.483
Is there a...

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:05.062
...doctor in the house?

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:40.162
Hey, sport.

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.162
Hi, Daddy.

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.225
How you feeling?

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:16.035
Feeling okay.

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:19.336
Heck of a way to start off
the summer, huh?

01:31:20.305 --> 01:31:26.893
