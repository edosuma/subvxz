10:45.012 --> 10:47.881
- I appreciate that, Mom,
but I'm going to Mars,

10:47.915 --> 10:50.283
one way or another
if I have to rent a spaceship

10:50.317 --> 10:52.820
and drive up there myself.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.822
- Don't you think this
whole astronaut thing

10:54.855 --> 10:57.290
is really childish?
Come on.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.927
- If by childish you mean
I'm pursuing every boy's

10:59.960 --> 11:03.831
dream of being
Neil Armstrong, then yes.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.766
- Well, every girl my age
dreamed of being

11:05.799 --> 11:08.969
Elizabeth Taylor, but not
everyone has our bone structure.

11:09.002 --> 11:14.007
- Was she an astronaut, too?

11:14.041 --> 11:17.410
- You know, when I was a
supple ingenue of seventeen,

11:17.444 --> 11:20.347
I was buying some
semi-sheer nylons

11:20.380 --> 11:24.017
and I was approached by a
talent scout from RKO.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.353
He regaled me with tales of
being in the movies.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.421
So I pulled on
my stockings

11:28.455 --> 11:30.858
and I raced home
to see my mother.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.493
And mother explained simply,

11:33.526 --> 11:35.395
that it was not a
suitable career

11:35.428 --> 11:39.466
for one with of our pedigree.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.770
[upbeat music]

11:46.840 --> 11:49.042
Call that man.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.879
- Did you know they can't use
ballpoint pens in space

11:51.912 --> 11:53.981
because there's no
gravity there.

11:55.849 --> 11:56.984
- Vanessa, I'm dying!

11:57.017 --> 11:58.485
- I can't hear you.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.487
I've sweated out my eardrums!

12:00.520 --> 12:01.955
I need to go to my
happy place.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.156
- Stay with me!

12:03.190 --> 12:05.793
- Netflix and chill.
Netflix and chill.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.361
- No, Netflix and Jill!

12:08.395 --> 12:11.765
- And time.
Next treatment.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.466
- This is worse!

12:13.500 --> 12:16.169
- Friends don't
freeze friends!

12:16.203 --> 12:18.505
- I knew he wasn't over
freshman year

12:18.538 --> 12:21.809
when we saw Soundgarden
without him!

12:21.842 --> 12:24.778
- Only 96 more seconds and you
will be burning calories

12:24.812 --> 12:26.880
like a Kenyan
marathon runner.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.417
- Netflix and warmth.
Netflix and warmth.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.420
- Remember when you
were a second year

12:33.453 --> 12:35.055
and skipped Law Prom to
cram case law on

12:35.088 --> 12:36.890
copyright infringement?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.491
Allen v Escott established
precedent of

12:38.525 --> 12:39.927
"innocent infringement."

12:39.960 --> 12:41.995
But didn't relieve
them of liability.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.865
Whether intentional or not,
we're dealing with a tort here.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.867
Andy: I was Super Andy.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.871
[keyboard clicks]

12:54.074 --> 12:57.077
- How's it coming, Andy?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.311
- Here ya go, Naz.

12:58.345 --> 13:03.016
I also translated it into German
for our oversees investors.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.018
- We don't have any
overseas investors.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.419
- I made some calls.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.823
- Incredible. Thank you.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.261
Andy: There was no
stopping me.

13:14.294 --> 13:18.598
Highest Tetris score ever!

13:18.631 --> 13:21.068
- Sixty degrees is the magic
angle and you're gonna hold this

13:21.101 --> 13:22.569
for twenty minutes.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.038
Oh, hey guys!

13:25.072 --> 13:29.442
- Hey Oliver! Thank you
so much for everything.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.545
We just have to go
and do busy stuff.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.114
- Honestly, I could not
imagine being exposed

13:34.147 --> 13:36.149
to any more treatments.
I'd probably die.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.051
- Of appreciation,
of course.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.987
But we're gonna
catch you later.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.787
- What a shame.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.889
You guys made it
through all that

13:41.922 --> 13:43.991
and you're going to
leave with the same tired face.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.193
- Listen, we love what
you're doing here,

13:46.226 --> 13:50.063
and I did notice my dermis is
tighter than Mike Pence's anus,

13:50.097 --> 13:52.499
but we just got-
- After the Vampire.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.567
- Okay, but I've made peace
with the fact that

13:54.601 --> 13:56.169
I am Wrinkle-stiltskin.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.470
- Before.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.571
- We'll do it.
- We'll do it.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.339
- Okay.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.340
Vanessa:
Considering the name,

14:00.373 --> 14:01.508
that wasn't as bad as I
thought it would be.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.277
Jill: Yeah, we're gonna be
glowing Edward Cullen style.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.547
CGI fireflies
everywhere.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.949
- Well?

14:11.618 --> 14:12.619
- I thought I was supposed
to look like a vampire,

14:14.087 --> 14:15.588
not mauled by one!

14:15.622 --> 14:17.224
- You'll be thanking me
soon enough.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.592
- When? ER patients want a
friendly face,

14:19.626 --> 14:21.895
not a sriracha spill.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.897
- First you scab and then
you peel,

14:23.931 --> 14:26.133
and if you're consistent with
the cream I gave you,

14:26.166 --> 14:27.667
you'll be zygotes
by Labor Day.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.070
- I have to take Hazel to her
Doubles Dance tonight.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.605
How can I do that if my face
looks like it has its period?

14:32.639 --> 14:35.442
- On the heaviest day of flow!

14:37.244 --> 14:38.478
- Jill, how are you?

14:38.511 --> 14:41.214
- I'm death warmed over and
frozen again.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.184
What are the chances I can ask
you a mega favor?

14:44.217 --> 14:45.585
- Technically it depends
on the favor as I have

14:45.618 --> 14:47.287
thirty minutes to get to
lower Madison

14:47.320 --> 14:48.255
to approve the
hors d'oeuvres,

14:48.288 --> 14:51.324
leaving me 15 minutes of
travel time except

14:51.358 --> 14:53.193
the barometric pressure
suggests a 30 percent

14:53.226 --> 14:55.628
chance of rain which would
slow me down by 90 seconds.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.364
- Whoa, Rainman.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.598
What happened
to Zombie Tag?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.100
- I had to pivot to pinot.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.134
What do you need?

15:01.168 --> 15:03.203
- I'm supposed to chaperone
Hazel to her dance

15:03.236 --> 15:04.504
and I look like
Hannibal Lecter

15:04.537 --> 15:06.373
after an all-you-
can-eat buffet.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.141
- Sorry, honey.
No problem.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.076
I will handle it.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.610
- Thank you and if you
can't figure it out

15:10.643 --> 15:12.712
I can try to call that face
transplant doctor.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.215
Hopefully I won't look like
John Travolta.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.516
- Honey, it's handled.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.186
- I owe you with every
remaining pore in my being.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.721
And I'll sneak in late so I
don't scar the kids for life.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.425
[lively rock music]

15:26.359 --> 15:28.428
- Well hello to you too,
my little Hazelnut.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.696
- Hey.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.498
- "Hey" is for mall rats.

15:31.531 --> 15:32.665
What's the face about?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.167
- I hate this dress.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.302
I look ugly.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.270
- Well it wouldn't have
been my first choice either,

15:37.304 --> 15:39.372
but with my DNA coursing
through your veins

15:39.406 --> 15:40.573
you could never be ugly...

15:40.607 --> 15:42.275
despite your mother's
contribution.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.376
- She made me get it.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.578
- Your mother dresses
like a sad doll

15:45.612 --> 15:47.147
in someone's attic.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.217
What did you have in mind?

15:54.654 --> 15:59.192
Saucy. And Bloomies
is on the way.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.397
Hazel, how do you feel?

16:04.431 --> 16:05.265
- I love it!

16:05.298 --> 16:06.733
Thank you so much.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.169
- Have fun!

16:09.202 --> 16:11.204
I'll be waiting.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.206
Driver: She's gonna be pulling
that thing up all night.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.608
- That's what I'm
counting on.

16:18.745 --> 16:24.217
- [deep-voiced chanting]

16:30.457 --> 16:36.329
- [chanting]

16:40.533 --> 16:41.634
- What are you doing here?

16:41.668 --> 16:44.471
- I am here to celebrate.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.605
I have Vindaloo.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.341
I have Tikka Masala.

16:48.375 --> 16:52.379
I have-
- No naan!

16:52.412 --> 16:53.813
- I have champagne.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.482
- What are we celebrating?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.684
- You have conquered India.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.286
And now, I'm one step closer

16:59.319 --> 17:03.723
to putting the von Weber
flag on Mars.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.459
I qualified for
the next round.

17:06.493 --> 17:07.194
- So this means-

17:07.227 --> 17:08.061
- Just one month to
prepare

17:08.095 --> 17:10.530
for the written and
physical exams.

17:10.563 --> 17:14.434
- An innovator's wife and
She-E-O of an empire.

17:14.467 --> 17:18.838
Am I the white Beyoncé or
is she the black me?

17:18.871 --> 17:24.377
- If I might take this
opportunity to curry your favor.

17:24.411 --> 17:28.681
- Not in front of Ganesha.
[laughing]

17:29.649 --> 17:31.651
- The key to building the
perfect charcuterie is

17:31.684 --> 17:33.286
juxtaposing
textures.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.622
You take a hard salami
with a soft pâté-

17:35.655 --> 17:38.658
- That's what she said.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.327
- More of the Cabernet?

17:40.360 --> 17:43.330
- This Cab is so earthy and I
can taste the maple,

17:43.363 --> 17:45.665
which is strange because that
region hasn't see maple trees

17:45.698 --> 17:47.300
since the drought of aught 5.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.802
- Impressive. Where did you
study?

17:49.836 --> 17:52.539
- I did a project in fifth
grade for Arbor Day.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.275
It's all just coming
back to me.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.476
[groans]

17:56.509 --> 17:58.511
- You have headache.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.780
I have cure.

18:00.813 --> 18:01.714
- I should switch to white.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.450
You are so right.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.621
[groans]

18:08.655 --> 18:10.423
- You okay, Andy?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.625
- Care to taste some
French wine?

18:12.659 --> 18:16.463
- Go, enjoy.

18:19.866 --> 18:23.370
- Well. How was the dance?

18:23.403 --> 18:24.837
- My friends and I had fun,

18:24.871 --> 18:26.773
but I think I got blisters
on my feet

18:26.806 --> 18:28.441
from dancing too much.

18:28.475 --> 18:32.145
- Today kitten heels,
tomorrow stilettos.

18:32.179 --> 18:35.448
From here on out
you're a slave to fashion.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.717
How did your new frock suit you
on the dance floor?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.453
- It was okay.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.823
Maybe this was, like,
a special occasion?

18:43.856 --> 18:48.761
I see. Well what do you say we
keep that dress safe for you

18:48.795 --> 18:51.498
at my place until you're
ready to wear it?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.533
- Cool. Thanks, Candace.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.702
- You know what I'm craving
right now is a frozen hot

18:55.735 --> 18:57.537
chocolate from Serendipity.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.572
Mind indulging me
on the way home?

18:59.606 --> 19:02.175
- I mean, if I have to.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.647
- And you can slip in
the bathroom

19:07.680 --> 19:10.149
and put this on so we
don't get busted.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.920
[distorted laughing]

19:16.889 --> 19:20.727
- [distorted voice]
Best Dad's night ever!

19:20.760 --> 19:22.195
- Have you eaten today,
Andy?

19:22.229 --> 19:24.397
You need some herring?

19:24.431 --> 19:26.466
- I think I just
need to lie down.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.434
- [distorted voice]
You gotta check out

19:27.467 --> 19:30.870
the effervescent room.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.776
The effervescent room.

19:36.809 --> 19:37.910
- I'm just gonna go.

19:44.984 --> 19:45.785
- You look like how
my throat feels.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.822
- I'm sorry. Long day of
no pain no gain.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.592
- Oh boy,
do I understand that.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.827
- I just need to run this
culture, so go home,

19:54.861 --> 19:56.329
get some rest
and I'll follow up.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.597
- You are a God send.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.367
I send you special thank
you of wine. Yes?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.535
- Yes, I wish all my patients
paid me in wine.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.837
It's where most of my
salary goes anyway.

20:04.871 --> 20:05.538
Feel better.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.473
- You too.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.575
- Is it that bad?

20:09.576 --> 20:10.943
[hiccup]

20:10.977 --> 20:14.281
- Oh no, he's been like this
for 36 hours?

20:14.314 --> 20:17.950
Looks like an acute
attack of Intractable Singultus.

20:17.984 --> 20:18.851
I think I have the cure,

20:18.885 --> 20:22.289
it's a bit unconventional,
do you mind?

20:22.322 --> 20:23.256

20:28.027 --> 20:29.929

Who's there?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.273
- Oh Andy. It's just me.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.975
- Oh God,
I'm hallucinating!

20:43.009 --> 20:44.911

look like myself

20:44.944 --> 20:47.013
in only seven weeks.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.581
What happened to you?

20:48.615 --> 20:50.417
Was Dads Gone Wild
a flop?

20:50.450 --> 20:53.052
- No, no. Evidently it was
a big success

20:53.085 --> 20:54.086
but I couldn't enjoy it

20:54.120 --> 20:57.457
'cause I was crashing so hard
from the Riterall.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.859
- You took drugs? Why?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.494
- Why did you do
that to your face?

21:01.528 --> 21:04.897
- Stupidly trying to
recapture my uth.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.433
- Ugh, what a day.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.867
- Seriously.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.536
[cell phone beeps]

21:09.569 --> 21:11.003
- What does Vanessa
have to say?

21:11.037 --> 21:13.606
- It's Brooke.
She "needs to talk."

21:13.640 --> 21:16.008
Why does she always text me
that right before bed?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.610
Now I'm going to
have nightmares.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.413
- That makes two of us.
