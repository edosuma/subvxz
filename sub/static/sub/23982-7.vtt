WEBVTT

00:01.586 --> 00:03.922
<i>We left the shootout
at the storage facility</i>

00:03.963 --> 00:05.298
<i>and headed to our meet-up.</i>

00:05.632 --> 00:08.176
<i>A parking garage at the Mohegan Sun Casino.</i>

00:13.640 --> 00:16.684
<i>I knew Pete wouldn't be there,
and I wanted to get Reggie to a hospital</i>

00:16.809 --> 00:19.479
<i>but he said we had to hide the money first.</i>

00:20.647 --> 00:21.689
Check the crates.

00:22.524 --> 00:24.526
- What am I looking for?
- I don't know.

00:24.901 --> 00:26.236
Something big and empty.

00:41.834 --> 00:42.794
What is that?

00:53.721 --> 00:54.597
It's hollow.

00:54.639 --> 00:56.641
<i>Wait, wait, wait...</i>

00:56.933 --> 01:03.439
You put $11 million inside fucking buffalo?

01:04.274 --> 01:05.775
It was the only thing big enough.

01:09.654 --> 01:10.530
A buffalo?

01:11.155 --> 01:13.116
A catasroph... wha...

01:13.157 --> 01:16.452
What the fuck was buffalo even doing there?

01:17.203 --> 01:18.288
It's an Indian casino.

01:19.539 --> 01:24.002
I know it's fucking Indian casino.

01:25.503 --> 01:31.593
Why was fucking buffalo
in fucking parking garage?

01:32.343 --> 01:33.511
I don't know.

01:34.679 --> 01:36.681
They have a museum.
Maybe they wanted--

01:36.723 --> 01:40.685
What are you, a Mohegan Sun expert now?
You join players' club?

01:44.564 --> 01:46.649
Your boyfriend,
he no tell me nothing like this

01:47.150 --> 01:50.570
which is something, because way I ask

01:51.446 --> 01:53.990
people always talk.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.537
Why wasn't the money in a safe?

02:08.212 --> 02:11.466
I have fucking Feds up my ass.

02:11.674 --> 02:14.427
Warrant for this, warrant for that.

02:14.469 --> 02:16.929
I think to myself, "Oh, what do I do?"

02:17.055 --> 02:19.474
I take the money,
and I put it in fucking locker

02:19.515 --> 02:20.975
where people leave shit behind.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.185
No one look there.

02:22.435 --> 02:23.519
Smart, huh?

02:23.561 --> 02:29.859
Because two days later,
Feds come in this place, rip shit apart!

02:30.276 --> 02:32.695
Tore out fucking walls looking for money!

02:33.905 --> 02:36.908
Only not so smart, maybe.

02:50.797 --> 02:52.965
How did you know money
was in fucking locker?

02:53.007 --> 02:54.509
I didn't, I don't know.

02:54.926 --> 02:55.843
I don't know.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.726
It was Constantine, yeah?

03:04.936 --> 03:06.854
Reggie just found a key.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.857
Reggie just found a key.

03:18.574 --> 03:23.788
Now, that is a shame, because Constantine,
he was good friend.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.378
Let's go, donkey.
We go get my fucking money.

03:30.461 --> 03:31.629
You, you can't.

03:33.715 --> 03:34.757
You... you can't.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.885
The Feds are still watching you.

03:37.927 --> 03:38.803
The...

03:40.388 --> 03:42.056
They wanted us to set you up.

03:42.724 --> 03:45.393
The Feds were talking to 'em
when Joe and I...

03:46.352 --> 03:47.395
When we grabbed 'em.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.189
Are they wired?

03:50.398 --> 03:52.358
No. We checked.

03:52.525 --> 03:54.819
What did you say to FBI?

03:55.695 --> 03:56.571
We said no.

03:57.613 --> 03:58.489
Why?

04:03.703 --> 04:06.706
Because she had a vision.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.085
The only way to get out of this was to
get the money and give it back to you.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.756
A vision?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.924
Yeah, she's some kind of psychic.

04:17.759 --> 04:18.634
Yeah?

04:20.928 --> 04:26.684
You know, in village where I grow up,
there was a woman who also...

04:26.726 --> 04:28.019
she had visions.

04:28.644 --> 04:35.610
She would read, uh, coffee grinds,
and she said she could see future.

04:36.652 --> 04:41.407
Only, do you know what
old woman did not see?

04:44.160 --> 04:45.161
War.

04:48.539 --> 04:52.585
War! 140,000 dead.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.839
Two million refugees.

04:57.465 --> 05:02.345
Not one premonition about decade of blood!

05:07.308 --> 05:08.935
Fucking gypsy horseshit.

05:10.770 --> 05:14.607
The... the Feds wanna catch you
with the money.

05:14.649 --> 05:17.902
They, uh, they...
they wanna get you on tax evasion.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.405
- Like Capone?
- That's right.

05:22.907 --> 05:27.245
So you, you can't go near your money
until it's safe to go near your money

05:27.662 --> 05:30.665
and we want to get it for you
and make it safe.

05:32.041 --> 05:32.917
OK.

05:34.126 --> 05:38.047
I give you 24 hours to figure out how.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.884
You fucking go with them.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.888
They fuck around at all, you remind them

05:47.223 --> 05:51.602
I get my money,
or entire family goes in fucking tub.

06:03.489 --> 06:05.533
- So Joe was your friend?
- Don't.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.827
You know, I've worked in grief therapy.

06:07.869 --> 06:12.123
Next fucking word out of your mouth
better be about where the money really is.

06:12.665 --> 06:14.458
Anything else, I throw you from this car.

06:15.459 --> 06:16.586
It's where I said.

06:16.919 --> 06:17.920
Fucking asshole.

06:18.421 --> 06:19.297
In a buffalo.

06:20.882 --> 06:22.383
- Yeah.
- When you started on that

06:23.217 --> 06:24.802
I thought you were going in the tub.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.228
That's why you stashed Pete at the casino

06:36.230 --> 06:37.648
so that he could watch the buffalo.

06:39.317 --> 06:41.944
I have to be the one
to give the money back to Luka.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.822
- According to your vision.
- Yes.

06:46.115 --> 06:47.241
How about you, Fake Pete?

06:48.492 --> 06:49.493
Do you have a vision?

06:53.623 --> 06:55.041
We're gonna need more operators.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.043
I'm thinking four.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.337
I could hire one locally, but, uh...

07:00.046 --> 07:02.590
I'm gonna have to go into the city tomorrow
to get the rest.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.927
We'll go to the city tomorrow.
You're not leaving my sight.

07:08.054 --> 07:09.597
And what about her? What does she do?

07:10.181 --> 07:12.058
I'll make a list of tools for her to get.

07:15.645 --> 07:18.189
At some point,
we're gonna have to open up a buffalo.

Driver's license?

08:05.528 --> 08:07.363
What if I get carded at the liquor store?

08:12.326 --> 08:14.161
You're not leaving the house.
You do know that, right?

08:14.203 --> 08:16.580
I was kidding, obviously.

08:18.249 --> 08:19.250
Oh, God.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.043
How many weeks?

08:21.544 --> 08:25.881
Mm, 23? Puking just stopped, so, yay.

08:27.383 --> 08:30.553
Hey, did Luis tell you
why he was bonding me out?

08:30.886 --> 08:31.762
Said he owed you.

08:32.722 --> 08:35.099
Oh. For what he owes me,
I should be in the Four Seasons

08:35.141 --> 08:36.350
not stuck here with you.

08:37.268 --> 08:40.021
- No offense.
- I'd rather be home with my kids.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.063
I hear ya.

08:42.148 --> 08:44.233
I'll be in court on Monday.
I don't come out.

08:44.275 --> 08:45.901
End of the month, I'll be in Niantic.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.779
Just can't believe
I'm having a baby in prison.

08:50.031 --> 08:50.906
Father around?

08:51.574 --> 08:52.450
Mexico.

08:53.409 --> 08:54.910
Why you skipped before.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.328
Can you blame me?

08:59.915 --> 09:04.045
So what are we gonna do?
Braid each other's hair, play Truth or Dare?

09:04.503 --> 09:06.756
I figured you'd want to watch what you want

09:06.881 --> 09:08.841
eat what you want, sleep when you want.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.843
- Just without leaving your sight?
- That's right.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.417
Feds.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.505
Subtle as fuck.

09:50.466 --> 09:52.134
Hey, I'm gonna need you
to wait in the car for this.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.803
You haven't caught on yet.

09:55.513 --> 09:56.555
I don't trust you.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.892
In fact, I blame you
for what happened to Joe.

10:04.814 --> 10:05.815
Say it's on me

10:06.398 --> 10:07.942
you'll never make it out of this car.

10:08.234 --> 10:10.569
No, it's not on you, it's not on me.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.279
It's on the guy who threw the acid.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.407
No, it's you, same as if you threw it.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.577
And it's got to be paid for.

10:19.537 --> 10:20.579
Pay for it you will.

10:20.621 --> 10:24.750
Listen, the person that I need to recruit
is gonna run if she sees you.

10:25.793 --> 10:26.669
Is it Gina?

10:27.419 --> 10:28.921
- Yeah.
- Get someone else.

10:28.963 --> 10:29.839
No.

10:30.089 --> 10:33.175
She's young, she's pretty,
and she's good at what she does.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.386
It needs to be Gina.
That's all we have right now.

10:40.558 --> 10:41.433
Go ahead.

10:44.728 --> 10:48.232
Oh, my God, I love your watch.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.776
My dad has one just like it.

10:50.818 --> 10:51.777
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.612
Thanks. My wife got it for me.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.114
- Oh!
- Well, my ex-wife, actually, I'm...

10:55.406 --> 10:56.282
I'm single.

10:56.574 --> 10:57.449
Aw.

10:57.575 --> 10:59.285
You can collect it at
the end of the counter.

11:00.161 --> 11:01.579
Right. Thanks.

11:03.998 --> 11:06.834
- Help the next--
- Coffee. Black coffee.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.964
- Can I talk to you for a few seconds?
- Why?

11:12.298 --> 11:13.299
Just give me ten seconds.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.718
If you don't like what I have to say,
then you'll never see me again.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.224
Just one second.

11:25.895 --> 11:26.854
Ten seconds.

11:28.898 --> 11:29.857
Five seconds.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.150
Listen.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.904
I need your help with this thing.

11:34.945 --> 11:35.821
I need you.

11:37.823 --> 11:38.782
Listen, listen.

11:42.912 --> 11:46.874
There's nothing...
there's nothing I can say about Gavin.

11:49.168 --> 11:51.545
I am, I am so sorry about that.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.845
I want you to be my partner on this thing.
You don't need me to teach you.

12:00.221 --> 12:01.680
I need you. I need your help.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.598
You're gifted.

12:06.435 --> 12:07.311
I need you.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.112
What's the timeline?

12:19.031 --> 12:20.074
It's accelerated.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.576
It's basically now.
I have to go out the back door.

12:22.618 --> 12:23.494
Why?

12:23.911 --> 12:25.788
You see that black Suburban outside?

12:27.498 --> 12:28.540
That's the FBI.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.294
Smart not to mention the Feds up front.

12:35.673 --> 12:36.799
There's another reason.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.850
Is that who I think it is?

12:46.892 --> 12:49.937
This is not just about
the money or the job.

12:51.855 --> 12:52.982
It's about revenge.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.944
Meet me out back.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.743
Otto.

13:05.369 --> 13:08.080
We don't see each other like we used to
back in the day, huh?

13:08.330 --> 13:12.543
Your guys have gotten smarter.
It's bad for the bail bond business, but...

13:13.210 --> 13:14.545
I just got better lawyers.

13:17.381 --> 13:18.966
So, you got my message?

13:20.551 --> 13:22.177
Your mess.. message? What message?

13:22.511 --> 13:23.804
The one I left with Julia.

13:24.138 --> 13:28.559
Oh, well, this is the first, uh,
first I'm hearing of it.

13:28.892 --> 13:32.563
I just wanted to ask you about
the housepainter I sent you through Moe.

13:35.065 --> 13:35.983
What?

13:36.317 --> 13:38.152
We're just talking
home improvements, right?

13:38.819 --> 13:39.695
Uh, yeah, right.

13:40.279 --> 13:42.948
I tried reaching him and nothing.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.243
Then this kid shows up, looking for him.

13:46.327 --> 13:47.202
Something happen?

13:48.996 --> 13:49.872
Ah, well...

13:51.373 --> 13:54.543
long and short of it
is he took an early retirement.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.005
Hm.

13:58.172 --> 14:01.091
His kid, you send him to Moe?

14:02.301 --> 14:04.511
- He the one that put him in a hospital?
- Uh-huh.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.429
Ah.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.473
His kid's the reason we're here.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.017
He didn't just bust Moe's jaw.

14:11.894 --> 14:16.315
He... he took something important from him

14:17.441 --> 14:18.317
and, uh...

14:19.318 --> 14:23.614
I was hoping that maybe
you could convince him to give it back.

14:25.491 --> 14:27.576
I'd love to, Otto,
but I don't know his name

14:27.785 --> 14:29.036
where he lives, nothing.

14:30.746 --> 14:31.622
Sorry.

14:32.623 --> 14:33.499
Yeah.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.065
Fuck.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.032
- Hi.
- Oh, God!

15:08.409 --> 15:11.161
- How're you feeling?
- I'm fine. Why?

15:11.703 --> 15:13.705
- You're not hungover?
- No.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.792
Ah, youth.

15:17.626 --> 15:20.170
- What are you doing?
- Um...

15:20.879 --> 15:22.089
I'm looking for this.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.591
A screwdriver?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.928
Yeah, well, uh,
you can read certain objects.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.764
You can feel the echoes of the person
who owned it before

15:30.806 --> 15:32.641
I mean, if it was important to them.

15:33.851 --> 15:34.977
This was your mum's.

15:36.395 --> 15:38.480
She had a special screwdriver?

15:38.522 --> 15:41.191
Well, yeah, she had an '85 Ford Bronco

15:41.233 --> 15:43.944
and, uh, one summer, the solenoid went out.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.447
- I don't know what that is.
- Yeah, neither did I

15:46.488 --> 15:48.657
but apparently,
you can't start a car without one.

15:48.699 --> 15:53.203
Anyway, this guy, he told Lila
that if you lay the shaft of a screwdriver

15:53.454 --> 15:57.749
across two points in the engine,
and you get a spark

15:57.791 --> 16:00.461
and it starts, but you're only supposed
to do that one time.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.379
And then you're supposed
to take it right to the shop

16:02.421 --> 16:05.466
but Lila, she did it all summer long.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.010
Are you gonna read the screwdriver?

16:08.051 --> 16:12.723
I mean, can you use that to contact my mum?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.184
That's why I'm here.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.147
- That kid's gonna kill someone.
- What?

16:20.856 --> 16:23.734
That piece of paper
he wanted to get out of his father's jacket

16:24.067 --> 16:27.404
dollars to doughnuts, it's got the name
of his father's next target.

16:27.446 --> 16:29.698
That could've been the receipt
for his dry cleaning for all you know.

16:29.740 --> 16:33.911
Look, I spent a day with the little prick!
Alright?

16:34.578 --> 16:35.913
I know.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.623
He wants to be like Daddy.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.083
What, uh... what business is that of yours?

16:41.418 --> 16:44.129
OK, look, we find him,
we get the Proclamation

16:44.171 --> 16:45.923
- and it's done, OK?
- OK.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.466
You happen to get his license plate?

16:47.508 --> 16:48.967
No, because I'm old and stupid.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.219
Of course I got his plate.

16:50.636 --> 16:51.970
Kid's gonna kill someone.

16:52.638 --> 16:55.682
Yeah, well,
maybe whoever it is deserves it.

16:55.724 --> 16:56.767
You ever think about that?

17:06.610 --> 17:08.070
Valerie Abeyta.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.624
Could you please stop doing that?

17:22.084 --> 17:22.960
Sorry.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.342
Tell me about your kids.

17:32.261 --> 17:34.179
- I'm interested.
- What do you want to know?

17:34.596 --> 17:35.472
How many?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.099
Two, girl and a boy.

17:37.558 --> 17:38.433
Nice.

17:39.268 --> 17:40.477
Where are they this weekend?

17:40.769 --> 17:42.980
With a sitter,
who I'm paying an arm and a leg.

17:43.814 --> 17:44.982
You a good mother?

17:48.527 --> 17:52.197
Depends, uh, what day it is and who you ask

17:52.406 --> 17:54.908
but... we do the best.

17:56.368 --> 17:59.246
I hope I'll be a good
mother when I get out.

18:00.706 --> 18:01.582
Any advice?

18:03.500 --> 18:04.710
Don't do it on your own.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.963
- Yeah, that ship's kinda sailed.
- Tell me about it.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.758
Look, the good outweighs the bad.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.595
You'll never love anyone
the way you love them

18:14.636 --> 18:17.472
so don't sweat the small stuff.

18:18.682 --> 18:21.059
And be prepared, because everyone thinks
they know how to raise your kids

18:21.101 --> 18:22.060
better than you do.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.729
Shit, they probably do.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.355
Some days it'll feel like that.

18:29.568 --> 18:30.444
Shit.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.697
Batteries must've drained
while I was in jail.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.117
Oy...

18:38.327 --> 18:39.411
What are their names?

18:39.870 --> 18:41.163
Ellen and Jacob.

18:42.080 --> 18:47.961
- Their father around?
- Uh... Well, Jacob's is, sort of.

18:48.420 --> 18:52.090
Ellen's dad is in New York, or was.

18:52.341 --> 18:56.803
- Uh-huh.
- He represents a... dark period in my life.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.390
Having Ellen sort of saved me.

19:22.788 --> 19:24.623
Motherfuck.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.044
No, no, no, no.

19:29.628 --> 19:30.629
Oh, no, no, no.

20:03.829 --> 20:05.580
Ah, fuck... come on.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.966
- You got a fucking problem, man?
- Holy shit.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.926
You're that fugitive, that guy on TV.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.428
- What? No, no, I...
- Yes!

20:19.469 --> 20:20.512
Security!

20:21.388 --> 20:22.806
Escaped convict!

20:23.974 --> 20:25.100
He's getting away!

20:28.687 --> 20:30.397
No, no, no, no!

20:35.360 --> 20:36.278
We got an hour.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.008
Shit, I'm such a klutz.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.655
Cookies or Christ, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying

21:20.697 --> 21:21.823
so just please--
Where is she?

21:21.865 --> 21:24.075
- Where is who?
- Do not fuck with me.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.869
I don't know who you are,
but I'm calling the cops.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.288
Please do. I work with Bernhardt Bail Bonds

21:28.663 --> 21:30.332
and we bonded out your friend Valerie...

21:30.373 --> 21:32.250
- Who the hell is Valerie?
- ...giving me the legal right

21:32.292 --> 21:35.212
to search anywhere I think she
might be hiding, so call the cops

21:35.253 --> 21:38.048
cos when they get here and we find Valerie
hiding in the attic or the basement

21:38.089 --> 21:40.383
or under a bed,
you go away for five to seven

21:40.425 --> 21:41.593
for aiding and abetting.

21:46.807 --> 21:47.682
Hands!

21:48.809 --> 21:49.684
Alright.

21:54.231 --> 21:55.857
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie.

21:58.819 --> 22:00.195
How did you know I was here?

22:00.654 --> 22:02.948
Your magazines.
Half the labels were for this address.

22:02.989 --> 22:06.326
I figured you either steal your friend
Wendy's mail, or you two are besties.

22:07.410 --> 22:08.995
Holy shit.

22:10.372 --> 22:13.250
You reported yours stolen,
then got a replacement. Nice.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.627
And, uh, this?

22:16.086 --> 22:17.045
I earned that.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.922
Teaching downward-facing dog?

22:20.507 --> 22:22.300
Well, I hope you enjoyed
your little escape attempt

22:22.342 --> 22:25.804
because you're gonna spend your last days
of freedom handcuffed to a fucking toilet.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.849
You do that, you might as well just pull
out your gun and shoot me right now.

22:29.850 --> 22:34.604
Luis is gonna fucking kill me, OK?
That's why he bonded me out.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.441
Why should I trust you?

22:39.985 --> 22:43.113
You didn't notice that janky-ass Beemer
that's been following us around, did you?

22:44.155 --> 22:47.534
That car belongs to Omar.
Omar belongs to Luis.

22:47.576 --> 22:51.496
He was just waiting for dark
to come in and pop me and probably you too.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.128
Did you skim that money from Luis?

22:58.211 --> 23:00.213
Of course I skimmed the money from Luis.

23:01.464 --> 23:05.135
- What if you just gave it back to him?
- I can't just give the money back to him.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.970
Then I'd be admitting that I took it.

23:07.304 --> 23:08.346
I'd be just as dead.

23:25.655 --> 23:26.531
Fuck.

23:28.283 --> 23:31.453
Tough way to fish,
catching 'em with your bare hands.

23:32.537 --> 23:33.413
Who's there?

23:34.164 --> 23:37.167
I guess you could call me
sort of a bridge troll.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.300
You got a...

23:45.884 --> 23:47.886
you got a name, bridge troll?

23:48.762 --> 23:49.638
Rusty.

23:50.347 --> 23:51.222
You?

23:51.973 --> 23:52.849
Bob.

23:53.391 --> 23:54.559
You fishing, Bob?

23:54.976 --> 23:57.604
Nah, actually,
I'm looking for something my girl...

23:57.646 --> 24:02.317
Well, my ex-girlfriend thought it would be
hilarious to throw off the bridge.

24:03.568 --> 24:05.570
What kind of something are we looking for?

24:07.238 --> 24:08.114
A watch.

24:08.490 --> 24:12.577
A watch? I don't wanna know
what you did to piss her off.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.163
Actually, Rusty, I'm...

24:15.914 --> 24:16.915
getting kinda thirsty.

24:16.957 --> 24:19.751
You wanna go up to the store,
if I give you this 20

24:19.793 --> 24:21.002
and pick us up a sixer?

24:21.586 --> 24:23.964
I haven't had a drink in 20 years.

24:24.422 --> 24:25.674
How about I help you instead?

24:25.715 --> 24:27.676
No, no, no, no, no, I got it, I got it.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.636
The river's so low, it'll be easy to spot.

24:29.970 --> 24:34.683
I got time.
Besides, I got a knack for finding stuff.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.359
Shit.

24:45.735 --> 24:46.611
"Shit"?

24:46.653 --> 24:48.446
- "Shit" what?
- The BMW.

24:48.697 --> 24:49.572
Fuck!

24:51.741 --> 24:52.617
Fuck.

24:52.826 --> 24:54.160
You're gonna get me fucking killed.

24:54.786 --> 24:55.954
I know how to lose a tail.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.088
What do you want me to do?

25:05.505 --> 25:06.840
I want you to kill her.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.300
I know, but do you want to wait for night?

25:09.342 --> 25:11.678
<i>I want you to wait until she stops
and shoot her</i>

25:11.720 --> 25:12.721
with your gun.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.222
<i>What about the blonde?</i>

25:16.141 --> 25:17.183
Only if you have to.

25:24.691 --> 25:29.487
It's like...
she's on the other side of a valley.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.409
She can't hear my voice.

25:36.870 --> 25:39.873
Sometimes it helps
if you tell me what you want.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.960
Then I can ask the right questions.

25:44.878 --> 25:45.754
How do you mean?

25:46.921 --> 25:49.591
Like, some people want to know answers.

25:49.632 --> 25:53.219
Some people want to know
if their loved ones are OK.

25:55.180 --> 25:59.392
I don't know. I guess I want to know
what her favourite colour was

26:00.226 --> 26:04.981
what kind of music she listened to,
what she'd think of me.

26:06.024 --> 26:11.780
Her favourite colour was the blue-green
of a swimming pool at night

26:12.363 --> 26:15.450
and her favourite songwriter
was Elvis Costello

26:15.492 --> 26:19.329
and she would've thought that you
were smart and pretty and funny.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.667
I guess what I really want
is something that...

26:27.212 --> 26:28.505
you can't give me.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.135
I want to hear her voice.

26:39.766 --> 26:40.809
You should get that.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.727
No, I don't know that number.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.354
I don't wanna answer it if...

26:44.521 --> 26:45.605
I know, but I know it.

26:46.439 --> 26:47.315
It's Julia.

26:50.401 --> 26:51.694
<i>How does it go?</i>

26:52.487 --> 26:53.363
It's going good.

26:53.488 --> 26:54.948
Marius is putting together his team.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.742
It's like <i>Ocean's 11.</i>

26:58.034 --> 27:00.745
Is he getting tiny Chinese men
to fit inside box?

27:01.663 --> 27:02.539
I don't think so.

27:03.581 --> 27:04.457
OK.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.046
Fuck.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.467
Do you know how much longer she's gonna be?

27:14.926 --> 27:16.636
Uh, she said she was gonna come right over.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.555
Please ignore my fiancé.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.014
We're supposed to be on vacation.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.433
Well, I'm sorry if I'm passionate
about my work.

27:22.475 --> 27:25.353
- Not all of us can be aimless millennials.
- OK.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.939
You don't mind showing off
this "aimless millennial"

27:27.981 --> 27:29.899
to your buddies at trade shows.

27:29.941 --> 27:31.651
- May I help you?
- Oh, hi, yeah.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.361
I'm so sorry to bother you,
I was just wondering

27:33.403 --> 27:35.238
how long have you had the Roosevelt?

27:35.989 --> 27:38.575
- I'm sorry?
- The Teddy Roosevelt buffalo.

27:38.616 --> 27:39.576
How long have you had it?

27:40.743 --> 27:42.537
Oh, you don't...? She doesn't know.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.497
She doesn't know.

27:45.123 --> 27:49.961
This buffalo was felled by the 26th President
of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt.

27:50.879 --> 27:53.381
- How do you know that?
- He stuffs dead animals.

27:53.423 --> 27:56.092
"I stuff dead a..."
I'm a professional taxidermist.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.468
Oh, say it loud, say it proud.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.220
Yeah, if you look at the left fore hoof

27:59.262 --> 28:02.348
you can see where he carved his initials,
"TR," right there.

28:04.058 --> 28:04.934
Oh, my.

28:04.976 --> 28:06.561
Yeah, at first,
I didn't think it was a Roosevelt

28:06.603 --> 28:09.772
because usually when people have something
like this, they put a big sign out

28:09.814 --> 28:12.442
that says "Roosevelt Buffalo,"
given the value of 'em.

28:12.859 --> 28:13.735
Such a waste.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.904
Twenty years ago,
it would've been worth $30,000

28:15.945 --> 28:19.073
but now it's upwards of
100, $150,000, easy.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.993
- This is worth $100,000?
- Well, it was.

28:22.035 --> 28:24.871
Unless something's done about it immediately,
it's not gonna be worth anything.

28:25.288 --> 28:28.041
- I, I don't understand.
- How long have you, uh, had it on display?

28:28.875 --> 28:31.836
Um... three years,
since the museum has been remodelled.

28:31.878 --> 28:34.255
And during that time, uh

28:34.339 --> 28:37.175
have you ever had it checked
for hard-shell beetle larvae?

28:37.383 --> 28:38.259
Uh...

28:38.801 --> 28:39.677
Suzanne?

28:40.261 --> 28:42.472
- Can I call you Suzanne?
- Sure.

28:43.181 --> 28:48.061
This buffalo has all the tell-tale signs
of a hard-shell beetle infestation.

28:49.437 --> 28:51.773
- That sounds bad.
- Yeah.

28:52.357 --> 28:53.274
Oh, that's bad.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.360
You better believe it's bad.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.898
Sorry to drag you into this,
but apparently you're the only Bernhardt

29:33.940 --> 29:35.525
who answers their goddamn phone.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.528
I'm always happy to assist
in a little tail drop.

29:44.409 --> 29:45.285
What?

29:45.660 --> 29:46.536
Uh, nothing.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.123
I don't see anyone, so...

29:50.915 --> 29:52.834
where are we taking
little Miss Flight Risk?

29:53.293 --> 29:55.628
- Uh, a motel, Lamplighter.
- I know it.

29:57.839 --> 30:01.759
But here's the thing,
the motel might be a good idea

30:01.801 --> 30:04.304
but I think the bad guys are expecting it.

30:05.555 --> 30:08.599
Lila and Danny had a skip once
with a target on his back.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.310
They put him in a storage unit.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.354
I'm not spending the weekend in a box.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.189
You are if I say you are.

30:17.692 --> 30:18.568
Where?

30:18.735 --> 30:20.403
They used one in Mount Vernon.

30:22.405 --> 30:23.323
I could take you to it.

30:29.037 --> 30:30.121
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

30:31.789 --> 30:34.208
You know how she lost you?
There was a second car.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.170
- They did a ditch-and-switch.
- Who the fuck are you?

30:37.211 --> 30:38.463
Your replacement, slick.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.923
You're not gonna be able to do this job.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.680
Come on, man.
It's no fun disposing of a body.

30:48.431 --> 30:49.432
Just open the door.

30:54.604 --> 30:55.480
Good.

30:55.813 --> 30:56.939
Now put your hands there.

30:57.815 --> 30:59.650
- You know you don't have to do this.
- Sure I do.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.320
I want the 50k your boss
put on that target's head.

31:03.404 --> 31:04.280
Hands.

31:08.618 --> 31:09.494
Come on, now.

31:10.161 --> 31:11.037
Man up.

31:12.705 --> 31:13.664
Close your eyes.

31:14.207 --> 31:16.876
That way you don't
know when it's coming.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.129
The fuck?

31:22.882 --> 31:24.550
It's her.

31:25.134 --> 31:26.010
Her who?

31:26.511 --> 31:27.929
It's fucking Maggie Murphy.

31:28.721 --> 31:29.597
Oh.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.228
Ah. Where's my money?

31:37.146 --> 31:38.022
It's close.

31:38.439 --> 31:39.357
You'll have it soon.

31:39.941 --> 31:40.983
Why are you here?

31:42.402 --> 31:43.820
I need to rent a unit.

31:48.574 --> 31:49.700
Is this sarcasm?

31:50.576 --> 31:54.622
From the woman who cleaned my units out?

31:55.456 --> 31:57.417
I need a storage unit for my niece.

31:57.542 --> 31:58.418
For your niece?

31:58.960 --> 32:00.545
My family is in bail bonds.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.546
She has a skip.

32:02.171 --> 32:06.008
I thought she should leave her skip here
for the weekend.

32:06.843 --> 32:08.594
You think this is fucking hotel?

32:09.929 --> 32:14.851
People try to stay here, I kick their ass.

32:15.351 --> 32:16.436
Just until Monday.

32:17.353 --> 32:20.356
Why it have to be here?
Why not Connecticut?

32:20.690 --> 32:22.316
People are looking for this woman.

32:23.818 --> 32:25.194
Your place is secure.

32:28.072 --> 32:30.199
Eh, because you fucking robbed it.

32:31.951 --> 32:32.827
Boss.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.002
Bako make good point.

32:42.378 --> 32:46.674
Your niece,
she will be around here sometimes

32:47.341 --> 32:48.926
to be checking in on the skip.

32:50.470 --> 32:54.724
So, if you fuck up
and don't bring me my money

32:55.975 --> 32:58.311
it's shorter trip to tub for niece.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.733
Come on, get in.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.194
In, in, in.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.071
There's no chair.

33:10.323 --> 33:11.407
Sit on your back.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.285
Well, what am I supposed to do
when the light goes off?

33:14.327 --> 33:16.120
I don't know. You had a yoga studio.

33:16.329 --> 33:17.371
Shavasana?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.084
What the fuck?

33:36.349 --> 33:38.684
Where the fuck is Marius?

33:38.893 --> 33:39.977
He's in the city.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.395
He's not in the fucking city.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.105
- Uh...
- Tell me, or I kill you.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.816
- I don't know.
- After I kill your fucking niece.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.832
Unit number, passcode, lock combination.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.334
- Thank you so much.
- It's OK.

34:03.793 --> 34:08.214
So that guy who was following you,
he's probably gonna be on your tail again.

34:08.965 --> 34:10.883
Uh, OK, I'll get someone else
to resupply her.

34:13.427 --> 34:17.056
- Do you have a gun?
- Uh, I do.

34:17.181 --> 34:18.057
- Um...
- Mm-hmm.

34:18.182 --> 34:21.978
It's not loaded, though.
I almost, um, shot this guy a few days ago.

34:22.436 --> 34:23.479
Mm-hmm? Load it.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.330
Well, most of the damage is done
in the larval phase

34:41.372 --> 34:42.748
which... which means...

34:43.040 --> 34:45.376
Basically the beetles lay their eggs
on the mounts

34:45.459 --> 34:49.672
in this case, uh,
your beautiful and valuable bison.

34:50.214 --> 34:54.427
Uh, and the larvae feed off the hair until
they pupate and grow into adult beetles

34:54.468 --> 34:55.886
which then lay their eggs.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.180
And then, the cycle starts all over again

34:58.222 --> 35:00.433
only this time there's more beetles
and therefore more damage

35:00.474 --> 35:03.519
and if you miss the warning signs,
and let several generations propagate

35:03.561 --> 35:08.941
then that Roosevelt bison out there
will be a goner within the year.

35:11.068 --> 35:11.944
Wow.

35:13.946 --> 35:17.825
Well, I'll review this situation
with the Tribal Elders

35:17.867 --> 35:19.410
and we'll make a plan.

35:19.702 --> 35:20.911
Yeah, the sooner, the better.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.789
- Thank you for the warning.
- Yeah, that's fine.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.833
You know, it's not really an issue, uh

35:25.875 --> 35:28.502
if you can get to it
before it becomes a health hazard, right?

35:28.544 --> 35:30.963
- Let's hit the tables.
- What kind of health hazard?

35:31.547 --> 35:33.341
Well, if it goes untreated

35:33.382 --> 35:38.012
what happens is microscopic airborne
bacteria get released into the air

35:38.054 --> 35:41.515
by the exploding corpuscles
in the beetle larvae.

35:41.557 --> 35:42.975
- Exploding...
- Beetle shit.

35:43.017 --> 35:44.685
- ...corpuscles?
- Yeah.

35:44.935 --> 35:48.481
Yeah, it gets into the ventilation system.
You know how contagion spreads.

35:48.522 --> 35:49.774
It's nasty.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.526
It's not deadly,
but it will get in your coffee.

35:52.568 --> 35:53.986
And the taste of it, it's like...

35:54.028 --> 35:56.697
If it gets really bad,
it's like musty beetle shit.

35:56.739 --> 35:59.116
Is this something that you could
treat for us?

35:59.367 --> 36:00.534
Yeah, it takes about an hour.

36:01.869 --> 36:03.412
Do you have equipment?

36:05.081 --> 36:09.502
Well, I'm a professional taxidermist,
so, yeah, I have the equipment.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.380
- Then would you...
- I would love to.

36:12.463 --> 36:14.382
- Of course I would love to, right?
- Mm-hmm.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.425
But we're on vacation, and the, uh...

36:21.013 --> 36:24.850
Well, what would you say to a comp
in the Honeymoon Suite?

36:25.893 --> 36:26.769
Seriously?

36:27.853 --> 36:30.064
If you'll fix the buffalo,
spray it or whatever.

36:30.523 --> 36:31.399
What do you think?

36:32.692 --> 36:34.777
If they throw in a stack of chips.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.161
Oh...!

36:51.627 --> 36:53.462
Ah! Fuck!

36:55.798 --> 36:58.217
People really treat this river
like a fucking dump.

37:01.929 --> 37:04.765
Used to come out here with my cousin
and catch crawfish.

37:05.850 --> 37:07.810
Tried to put 'em in the fridge
to scare our grandma.

37:08.477 --> 37:09.353
Never worked.

37:11.147 --> 37:13.274
Look, Rusty, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna call it.

37:13.607 --> 37:14.483
Hm?

37:15.735 --> 37:17.194
You find the watch, you keep it.

37:17.820 --> 37:21.240
Just be glad she didn't cut your dick off
and throw that off the bridge.

37:23.033 --> 37:24.994
You saw someone's dick
get thrown off the bridge?

37:25.661 --> 37:26.537
Nah.

37:27.329 --> 37:28.205
Though, uh...

37:29.206 --> 37:32.460
the other night, someone tossed this.

37:35.755 --> 37:36.839
You looking for this?

37:38.340 --> 37:40.760
Come on, now, son,
you ain't looking for no watch.

37:41.635 --> 37:42.511
You want it?

37:45.639 --> 37:46.515
Yeah.

37:47.558 --> 37:48.809
You kill somebody with it?

37:49.477 --> 37:50.352
No.

37:50.728 --> 37:51.729
Did somebody else?

37:56.484 --> 37:57.359
They deserve it?

37:58.903 --> 38:03.491
Oh, Rusty, I don't know
who deserves what anymore.

38:05.868 --> 38:07.036
<i>What happened?</i>

38:09.371 --> 38:10.414
He gave me the gun.

38:11.582 --> 38:12.458
Oh...!

38:13.042 --> 38:14.251
He could identify you.

38:14.293 --> 38:16.170
No, nobody knows
that I threw it in the river.

38:16.212 --> 38:17.922
There'd be no reason to ask him.

38:18.214 --> 38:19.089
Where is it?

38:19.298 --> 38:20.174
Grandma.

38:20.633 --> 38:23.385
I'm telling you all this so that you know
that things are in process

38:23.427 --> 38:25.554
- but I... You don't need to know.
- The hell I don't.

38:26.180 --> 38:28.516
What are you going to do with the gun now?

38:30.601 --> 38:32.853
- The hitman.
- The one your grandfather hired

38:32.895 --> 38:35.397
to put a hit on himself? What about him?

38:35.815 --> 38:37.399
I'm gonna bury the gun with the body.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.318
- Oh!
- I'm gonna call in a tip

38:39.360 --> 38:42.947
hope that the gun gets to Detective Roby
before the blood panel comes in.

38:44.073 --> 38:46.742
You know where the body is buried?

38:46.784 --> 38:49.453
Grandma, you don't need to know
anything else.

38:52.081 --> 38:53.415
There's nothing I can do?

39:00.422 --> 39:01.298
Grandma.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.303
Just sit tight.

39:15.145 --> 39:16.564
And if what you do doesn't work?

39:16.605 --> 39:18.982
- It's gonna work.
- If it doesn't?

39:20.901 --> 39:23.404
And they send me away
for God knows how long

39:24.238 --> 39:26.407
I have to know my family is safe.

39:27.616 --> 39:28.492
Safe from what?

39:29.076 --> 39:34.123
Your long-lost cousin and aunt show up
after 20 years, both with criminal records.

39:34.164 --> 39:37.960
Tell me you haven't asked
yourself, why now?

39:38.919 --> 39:40.588
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't.

39:41.046 --> 39:41.922
OK then.

39:42.464 --> 39:45.509
I'm gonna find out
what Maggie and Pete are up to.

39:46.218 --> 39:47.094
Grandma...

39:47.678 --> 39:49.013
I have to do something.

39:51.015 --> 39:51.891
OK.

39:52.224 --> 39:53.309
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

39:53.642 --> 39:55.769
<i>I just wanted to see how you were doing
in New York.</i>

39:55.853 --> 39:58.147
Yeah, good.
We're just crewing up, you know.

39:58.606 --> 40:00.274
How's it going there with the tools?

40:01.442 --> 40:02.318
Got 'em.

40:12.661 --> 40:14.663
Do you know the guy who
said you were a fugitive?

40:16.498 --> 40:17.374
Huh?

40:17.833 --> 40:20.419
Just wondering if it's a friend or something,
somebody trying to fuck with you.

40:22.838 --> 40:25.049
No, I've never seen the guy before
in my life.

40:25.799 --> 40:27.635
Where are you a fugitive from exactly?

40:27.968 --> 40:30.095
You know, I-I-I ain't got to tell you shit.

40:31.388 --> 40:34.350
- Buddy, I am just trying to help you.
- OK, yeah.

40:35.434 --> 40:39.146
There is no one matching your description
listed as a fugitive.

40:41.941 --> 40:42.816
What?

40:45.819 --> 40:47.696
Oh, you son of a bitch, Marius...

40:47.780 --> 40:48.656
What?

40:50.866 --> 40:51.867
I gotta get out of here.

40:51.909 --> 40:54.244
Until I understand what's going on,
you're not going anywhere.

40:54.578 --> 40:55.454
No, no.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.415
I know my rights, OK?

40:58.457 --> 41:01.961
Unless I'm under arrest
or you're gonna charge me with a crime

41:02.378 --> 41:03.587
you've gotta let me go.

41:03.629 --> 41:04.505
So, come on.

41:04.922 --> 41:06.173
Take the cuffs off. Come on.

41:11.595 --> 41:13.597
OK, yeah, yeah.

41:15.474 --> 41:18.602
If anybody gets close,
just tell 'em it's toxic within five feet.

41:27.486 --> 41:29.655
Hey, I was about to call you.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.242
Blood test come back?

41:33.867 --> 41:37.746
No, but my afternoon became free
so I came up to go through evidence again.

41:37.788 --> 41:40.749
Just spent a half hour going through
the garbage from Winslow's car.

41:40.791 --> 41:43.752
Found a piece of paper with some numbers
scrawled on it.

41:46.046 --> 41:48.090
- Phone number or...?
- Not enough digits.

41:49.299 --> 41:53.345
- An address?
- 39 27 15.

41:55.222 --> 41:56.306
Mean anything to you?

41:57.099 --> 41:58.058
No, I don't...

42:01.353 --> 42:05.441
General Tso's chicken, shrimp fried rice,
and a hot and sour soup.

42:08.068 --> 42:09.653
- Winslow's takeout order.
- Ah.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.531
- You cracked the case.
- Wide open.

42:12.573 --> 42:16.827
You know, I can understand why you wanted
to share this momentous moment with me.

42:17.119 --> 42:19.496
Well, actually, um, it just made me hungry

42:20.039 --> 42:23.167
and you seem to be the guy
who knows where to eat around here, so.

42:33.927 --> 42:35.387
Did you betray your friend?

42:38.891 --> 42:40.434
Ah, you'll say anything, won't ya?

42:40.476 --> 42:43.145
- If you don't wanna talk about it--
- You know I don't wanna talk about it

42:43.896 --> 42:45.355
and yet you asked the question.

42:47.024 --> 42:48.358
To what fucking end?

42:56.784 --> 43:01.371
Three months looking for you,
Luka comes to me.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.043
Says he doesn't trust Joe.

43:07.753 --> 43:10.714
I say, "Joe's a little hot-headed,
but he's smart."

43:13.175 --> 43:18.472
And Luka says give him a heads-up
if, you know, Joe's thinking anything.

43:18.764 --> 43:19.807
He'll pay me extra.

43:23.227 --> 43:26.396
I told him, "Joe's cool.
Keep your money."

43:29.650 --> 43:32.111
And a few days ago, he asks again.

43:34.947 --> 43:39.535
I say, "Joe's a little antsy,
but I can handle him."

43:43.330 --> 43:44.206
That's it.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.043
That's all I said.

43:52.339 --> 43:53.382
It's my father.

43:53.799 --> 43:54.758
On speaker.

43:56.927 --> 43:57.803
Hey, Dad.

43:58.053 --> 43:59.054
<i>Where are you?</i>

44:01.181 --> 44:03.725
Uh, just running an errand.

44:04.184 --> 44:07.563
- In the, uh, state of Connecticut?
- Yeah, Dad.

44:09.022 --> 44:10.274
Can you come for dinner?

44:10.983 --> 44:11.859
<i>Not tonight.</i>

44:13.110 --> 44:13.986
Tomorrow?

44:14.653 --> 44:17.322
Dad, have you discussed
this with Mum at all?

44:17.948 --> 44:20.909
Look, I do not need to run everything
by your mother.

44:21.368 --> 44:23.912
Oh, you almost sound convincing
when you said that.

44:24.121 --> 44:24.997
Did I?

44:25.914 --> 44:26.915
Well, I was trying.

44:27.332 --> 44:28.208
Yeah.

44:28.333 --> 44:31.128
<i>It's so good to have you back, pumpkin.</i>

44:32.045 --> 44:35.299
Best thing to happen in 20 years.

44:36.758 --> 44:37.843
For me, too, Dad.

44:39.136 --> 44:40.012
I love you.

44:40.846 --> 44:41.889
<i>Love you, too, Mags.</i>

44:42.764 --> 44:43.849
Call you tomorrow.

44:48.979 --> 44:50.731
You hadn't seen your fam in 20 years?

44:52.524 --> 44:53.400
Why?

44:53.775 --> 44:54.985
I don't know anymore.

44:59.198 --> 45:00.073
Boom.

45:01.992 --> 45:04.912
- You get it?
- I got to pay for a new crown.

45:04.953 --> 45:09.333
Cracked his tooth on a pistachio shell
but, yeah, I got it.

45:10.209 --> 45:11.960
According to the license plate...

45:12.002 --> 45:13.462
- There you go, Sammy.
- Thank you.

45:13.879 --> 45:16.715
Hitman's son is Colin McCann.

45:16.965 --> 45:19.968
Lives with his dad, the late David McCann

45:20.010 --> 45:22.346
at 2574 Beachwood.

45:31.855 --> 45:32.731
Oh!

45:34.399 --> 45:36.985
Don't, don't come in here!
You're inhaling the fumes!

45:37.236 --> 45:38.904
You have to come out of the tent.

45:39.446 --> 45:40.656
Let's go, now.

45:41.406 --> 45:45.494
OK, I'm sorry. I'm in the middle
of a very delicate procedure here and I...

45:49.373 --> 45:50.832
Is there something you want to tell me?

45:50.874 --> 45:52.334
What did she say to you?

45:52.834 --> 45:54.795
I told her you're a con artist.

45:55.045 --> 45:56.421
Oh, really? Really?

45:56.463 --> 45:57.673
OK, what else did she say?

45:58.048 --> 46:00.384
She said you're trying
to steal the buffalo.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.552
Does it look like I'm trying to steal
the buffalo or does it look like I'm trying

46:02.594 --> 46:06.848
- to save a priceless piece of Americana?
- Ask him if he has any credentials.

46:07.140 --> 46:09.184
Of course I have ATA accreditation.

46:09.226 --> 46:11.937
I-I-I don't have it on me,
because it's all electronic now.

46:11.979 --> 46:15.148
- What are you doing here, Andrea?
- My name's not Andrea.

46:15.190 --> 46:17.567
Can I talk to you for a second?
Can I just talk to you for one second

46:17.609 --> 46:19.194
over here? No. No, no!

46:19.236 --> 46:21.822
I'm gonna... I'm gonna talk to her
in private, you fucking stalker.

46:21.863 --> 46:22.864
Not you. I'm sorry.

46:22.990 --> 46:24.574
Can I just talk to you for one second?

46:24.616 --> 46:28.495
Look, I don't... I don't know
what her driver's license says

46:28.537 --> 46:31.957
but her name's Andrea Little,
and obviously we have a history.

46:32.249 --> 46:34.293
Let's just say, though,
I left her at the altar

46:34.334 --> 46:38.797
only the altar this time was the locked
ward at the Marienbad Psychiatric Facility

46:38.839 --> 46:40.674
in Baden-Baden, Germany.
Oh, yeah.

46:40.716 --> 46:42.926
Two days before we were gonna tie the knot

46:42.968 --> 46:46.930
I found out she was clinically insane
and that everything she told me was a lie.

46:47.139 --> 46:51.059
And ever since she got out, she's been
trying to systematically ruin my life.

46:51.101 --> 46:52.144
- Gina? Gina...
- Yes.

46:52.185 --> 46:56.189
Tell Suzanne how Crazy Andrea has been
trying to make our lives miserable.

46:56.315 --> 46:58.859
I thought we weren't gonna use words
like "crazy" anymore.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.570
- I know, I know. Look at my hand, I'm shaking.
- I know, baby, I'm sorry.

47:01.611 --> 47:04.573
She is better when she's under
a physician's care, but when she's not

47:05.157 --> 47:06.992
there have been times
we've been afraid for our lives.

47:07.075 --> 47:10.078
No, you need to call security
and take her someplace safe

47:10.120 --> 47:11.580
and then I'll finish the buffalo.

47:12.039 --> 47:13.915
She said I shouldn't believe
anything you said.

47:13.957 --> 47:15.792
Of course she did. Classic projection.

47:15.876 --> 47:17.294
You know what? I'm gonna, I...

47:17.336 --> 47:20.047
I'm gonna talk to her for one second.
I'm gonna get Dr Zeltzer on the phone

47:20.088 --> 47:21.506
and then, then hopefully
I'll finish the buffalo.

47:21.548 --> 47:22.424
OK, but...

47:23.925 --> 47:25.260
Is it really a famous buffalo?

47:26.636 --> 47:27.804
I don't know.

47:28.305 --> 47:29.514
May I make a suggestion?

47:30.140 --> 47:31.183
Yes, Kwahu.

47:32.476 --> 47:36.188
Seeing as this is our slow season,
maybe there's another way to go at this.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.485
I... I talked to this homeless guy today.

47:42.986 --> 47:45.072
And, uh... Mmm.

47:45.781 --> 47:46.656
Good.

47:46.698 --> 47:47.657
There we go, hm?

47:48.617 --> 47:52.120
He seemed like such a smart guy, you know?

47:52.245 --> 47:53.497
Sharp, sense of humour.

47:55.082 --> 47:56.583
Could've been anything.
Could've been a... Here.

47:58.668 --> 48:00.087
A teacher or accountant.

48:01.588 --> 48:02.631
Or a cop?

48:04.466 --> 48:05.634
I was gonna say detective.

48:10.222 --> 48:13.600
Point is, he was a really regular guy,
you know?

48:13.642 --> 48:17.229
And I couldn't help think,
"What the hell happened?", you know?

48:17.979 --> 48:19.356
What went wrong for this guy?

48:20.690 --> 48:21.566
Mmm.

48:24.236 --> 48:25.112
Well...

48:26.905 --> 48:28.782
yeah, I mean, if a guy like that...

48:29.491 --> 48:31.201
if it can happen to him
then it could...

48:32.285 --> 48:33.537
really happen to any of us.

48:35.455 --> 48:36.498
Happen to you

48:37.416 --> 48:38.375
maybe even me.

48:39.167 --> 48:40.252
Probably not you.

48:45.173 --> 48:49.177
I think the road to hell is paved
with a million small bad choices.

48:50.262 --> 48:52.514
People still think that if they can find
the one wrong decision

48:52.556 --> 48:55.016
that's responsible for
all their bad luck...

49:02.607 --> 49:03.817
It just get cold out here?

49:03.984 --> 49:07.154
No, it was... family business rival.

49:07.195 --> 49:08.321
The guy's a total dick.

49:13.785 --> 49:15.745
He's certainly punching above
his weight class.

49:18.498 --> 49:19.541
So that's who it is.

49:21.543 --> 49:22.419
What?

49:23.044 --> 49:24.004
Who Bowman's fucking.

49:24.212 --> 49:25.839
Some NYPD detective.

49:25.881 --> 49:28.467
The guys at the station
say they've been together all week.

49:28.508 --> 49:31.553
Now he takes her out for what I
guess for him is a lavish meal.

49:37.142 --> 49:38.351
- God!
- The fuck was that about?

49:38.393 --> 49:41.855
Yeah, well, I could ask you the same thing,
except I know what you were doing.

49:41.897 --> 49:44.232
- You were trying to steal the money.
- Of course I was.

49:44.274 --> 49:45.650
That's our fucking job.

49:45.692 --> 49:47.527
Yeah, well, you're trying to
steal the money for yourself.

49:47.569 --> 49:49.446
- No, I wasn't.
- You said you were in New York.

49:49.654 --> 49:51.114
- When we were on the phone!
- Yeah.

49:51.156 --> 49:52.407
I thought the FBI were listening.

49:52.449 --> 49:54.159
Earlier, you said that's where
you were going.

49:54.201 --> 49:56.912
I told you I was trying to crew up.
I came here to suss it out.

49:56.953 --> 49:59.706
I saw an opportunity, I took it.
I-I called you five times.

49:59.748 --> 50:01.958
- Oh, yeah, when? When?
- A couple hours ago.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.212
- OK, let me see your phone.
- I... the fucking phone is in the car.

50:05.253 --> 50:07.631
Listen, we still have a chance here.
We gotta go, come on!

50:07.672 --> 50:10.759
I thought that you cared about the family,
about Julia.

50:11.051 --> 50:13.053
I mean, maybe not me, but Carly?

50:13.261 --> 50:16.097
What happens when Luka
dissolves Carly in acid?

50:16.598 --> 50:18.767
- Say what, now?
- Yeah, he hasn't told you?

50:18.808 --> 50:21.853
Luka is threatening to kill us all
if he doesn't get his money.

50:22.270 --> 50:23.438
The people on the farm?

50:24.856 --> 50:27.484
I thought all that "never get
attached" talk was just a pose.

50:27.526 --> 50:28.944
- Listen, the family...
- That's cold.

50:28.985 --> 50:31.238
...is not in danger, I was gonna get
the money and give it to Luka.

50:31.279 --> 50:32.572
We can't give Luka the money.

50:32.948 --> 50:35.367
- What do you mean we can't give him the money?
- We can't give him the money.

50:35.408 --> 50:38.411
- What do you mean? What about your vision?
- My vision changed

50:38.578 --> 50:40.997
the second I saw the acid
hit that guy's face.

50:41.039 --> 50:43.208
- Someone's face?
- So now you have a new vision?

50:43.250 --> 50:44.834
- Yes.
- You have a new vision?

50:44.876 --> 50:47.379
But in this vision,
we get to keep the money.

50:47.629 --> 50:48.547
Hey!

50:50.048 --> 50:51.925
- Oh, God.
- What the fuck is he doing here?

50:51.967 --> 50:54.761
Look, it was either bring him
or Julia dies, OK?

50:55.053 --> 50:56.429
You were supposed to bring him outside.

50:56.721 --> 50:58.640
- I-I tried, Frank.
- Wow, hi.

50:58.682 --> 51:00.517
- Why don't we take a walk together, huh?
- No, no, don't.

51:00.559 --> 51:02.227
- Feel like we've been here before.
- You said that you wouldn't hurt him, Frank.

51:02.269 --> 51:03.770
I'm a bad guy. I lie.

51:03.812 --> 51:04.729
Mum!

51:11.695 --> 51:12.571
Hey, Ma.

51:15.156 --> 51:16.032
Pete, I'm...

51:19.035 --> 51:20.203
Hi. Oh, my God.

51:20.245 --> 51:21.788
- You look older.
- Oh.

51:22.330 --> 51:23.206
You don't.

51:27.210 --> 51:28.503
Give me one second, OK?

51:30.130 --> 51:31.006
Marius.

51:31.172 --> 51:32.632
Pete! How you doin'?

51:34.593 --> 51:36.595
That's for making me
think I was a fugitive.

51:36.636 --> 51:37.721
- Stop it!
- Asshole.

51:39.097 --> 51:39.973
Who are you?

51:42.434 --> 51:43.310
OK.

51:46.354 --> 51:47.230
Listen.

51:48.565 --> 51:49.441
Listen...

51:49.733 --> 51:51.568
we all want the money, right?

51:51.610 --> 51:57.365
The fumigation con isn't dead yet,
so let's just go get the fucking money.

51:57.657 --> 51:59.326
Kwahu says we have to go to the casino.

51:59.367 --> 52:00.493
Who the fuck is Kwahu?

52:00.535 --> 52:02.454
- He's been watching the buffalo.
- What?

52:02.495 --> 52:04.080
You think I was the only one?

52:04.122 --> 52:06.124
Yeah, he's the one who told me
what you were doing.

52:06.166 --> 52:08.710
- Not so smart now, huh, Marius?
- Wait, did he say museum or casino?

52:08.752 --> 52:09.711
He said casino.

52:11.755 --> 52:13.340
Wait!

52:23.850 --> 52:26.269
Aright, so the three of us
are gonna be banned from the casino.

52:26.519 --> 52:28.229
You can't be seen with us. Wait over there.

52:28.271 --> 52:29.230
Go, go, go.

52:34.194 --> 52:35.070
Suzanne.

52:36.154 --> 52:39.574
Hey, I'm sorry about that.
Uh, Andrea's calmed down.

52:39.616 --> 52:40.492
Sorry about that.

52:41.159 --> 52:42.702
I'm gonna have to ask
the three of you to leave.

52:42.744 --> 52:44.913
Right, but, you know,
we were in the middle of the fumigation.

52:44.954 --> 52:47.332
The buffalo really should be secluded
because of the toxicity.

52:47.374 --> 52:48.583
Don't make me get security.

52:50.126 --> 52:52.128
Oh, is that how it's gonna be? Really?

52:52.295 --> 52:55.423
OK, so, when the buffalo's corpuscles
explode all over the place

52:55.465 --> 52:57.342
that's gonna be on you, literally.

52:58.385 --> 52:59.886
Come on, Gina. Come on, Andrea.

52:59.928 --> 53:01.012
But my name is not...

53:07.018 --> 53:10.730
It's in the middle of a casino,
surrounded by 24-hour security.

53:11.022 --> 53:12.273
How do we get to it now?

53:13.483 --> 53:15.902
If David Copperfield can make
the Statue of Liberty disappear

53:15.944 --> 53:17.946
we can vanish a buffalo from a casino.
