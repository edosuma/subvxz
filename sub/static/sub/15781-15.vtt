00:09.776 --> 00:10.744
Dr. Donahue!

00:10.810 --> 00:11.903
Uh, hold up there!

00:12.045 --> 00:14.310
Dr. Donahue! Phil!
Hey.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.309
Oh. I-I didn't hear you.
Is there a problem?

00:16.383 --> 00:19.148
Dr. Donahue,
I-I just got to tell you

00:19.219 --> 00:22.189
that your convergent ex-maze --
stunning.

00:22.255 --> 00:24.520
We were about to stop
his doggone heart there.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.124
You were all ready
to saw that guy open.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.287
And I'm all, "It's just a
paroxysmal afib.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.354
You should mop out a cox maze
for the ex-maze,

00:32.432 --> 00:34.162
slam an ablation cath
in the old groin, and bingo!

00:34.234 --> 00:35.827
The guy could drive home
in the morning.

00:35.902 --> 00:38.872
Astounding.
And the board was impressed.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.930
I-I'm talking promotion
impressed there.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.737
Oh, that's, uh,
not necessary.

00:42.809 --> 00:45.142
Which is why I'm glad
I ran into you.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.306
It seems we don't have
all your papers on file,

00:48.381 --> 00:50.941
so we just called
The Johns Hopkins there, and --

00:51.017 --> 00:53.009
J-Johns H-Hopkins?
You called them?

00:53.086 --> 00:54.918
No, no.
I didn't go there.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.184
Really?
Oh, you -- you told me you did.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.385
No, I told you
I went to Stanford

00:59.459 --> 01:02.623
and that I studied under
Dr. Johns Hopkinsburg --

01:02.695 --> 01:05.927
Dr. Johns Hopkinsburg
at the Stanford University.

01:05.999 --> 01:09.094
Oh. Let me just run and get Dr.
Bennett, and we'll --

01:09.169 --> 01:11.229
we'll sort out
this little oversight.

01:11.304 --> 01:13.102
I'll just be a sec.
Wait right here.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.768
I won't go anywhere.
I'm glued!

01:15.842 --> 01:17.208
Look. I can't move my feet

01:17.277 --> 01:19.246
because they're stuck
to the floor.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.336
Oh -- oh, no, look!

01:20.413 --> 01:21.472
It's like molasses.

01:21.548 --> 01:22.607
[ makes creaking noise]

01:22.682 --> 01:24.742
Oh, I am so fucked.

01:32.158 --> 01:34.423
I knew you were
coming tonight.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.725
I'm at peace.
Just make it quick.

01:36.796 --> 01:37.764
A deal's a deal.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.891
What are you waiting for?!
Do it!

01:39.966 --> 01:41.798
Come on, you fuckin' freaks!

01:41.868 --> 01:42.699
[ coughing ]

01:45.638 --> 01:47.834
Hey, see that bag
hanging there?

01:47.907 --> 01:49.307
That's my shit!

01:49.375 --> 01:51.139
[ coughs ]
Eat it!

02:12.198 --> 02:13.461
They looked straight at me.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.001
Trust me.
It was the same guys.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.162
We have to give it all back.
- Everything?

02:17.237 --> 02:20.207
What, the spelunking gear,
the dune buggy, the --

02:20.273 --> 02:22.105
the pool table
in the secret lab?

02:22.175 --> 02:23.939
Not the secret --
Billy, not the lab.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.672
All that crap --
everything!

02:25.745 --> 02:27.441
- Everything?
- Everything?

02:27.514 --> 02:28.482
What is that?

02:28.548 --> 02:30.779
Robo-Bo, our robotic
butler/manservant,

02:30.850 --> 02:34.787
in the imposing, yet familiar
guise of Bo Duke.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.117
Don't act like
we didn't talk about this.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.487
Well, we didn't!

02:37.557 --> 02:39.549
You asked me which Duke boy
I liked better.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.754
And you said Bo, so Ta-da!
Robo-Bo!

02:41.828 --> 02:44.024
Yeah, well, I didn't think
for a second that you were go--

02:44.097 --> 02:46.259
we got to give that
horrible thing back, too.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.664
They are fucking vampires,

02:47.734 --> 02:49.134
and they're coming to suck
all my blood out.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.467
Billy, you're overreacting.
- Ya think?

02:51.538 --> 02:53.530
Three creepy guys
appear on our doorstep

02:53.606 --> 02:55.199
and hand us a check
for like $10 million!

02:55.275 --> 02:57.005
We are
Conjectural Technologies.

02:57.076 --> 02:59.636
It's perfectly normal
for us to get investors!

02:59.712 --> 03:01.806
We sold our souls
to vampires!

03:01.881 --> 03:04.009
We sold shares
of our hot new company.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.210
It's completely normal.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.346
I just saw our shareholders
materialize out of thin air,

03:08.421 --> 03:09.753
then steal the heart

03:09.822 --> 03:11.586
of a 400-hundred-pound
talking gorilla.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.149
Is that normal?

03:13.226 --> 03:14.819
They're here.
[ pounding on door]

03:14.894 --> 03:17.193
Okay, I'm gonna tell them
we're gonna give everything back

03:17.263 --> 03:19.494
and that this was
all a misunderstanding.

03:19.566 --> 03:21.728
Hand me my neck brace.
- That's not gonna work.

03:21.801 --> 03:22.860
Oh, it does.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.905
When the vampires
try to bite my neck,

03:24.971 --> 03:25.836
they're gonna get nothing

03:25.905 --> 03:27.567
but a mouthful of foamy,
cervical collar.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.131
Door for Master Billy.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.405
I'm gonna go fix this, okay?

03:31.477 --> 03:33.708
But if I don't return,
you come find me.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.578
Don't let them make me
a vampire, White.

03:35.648 --> 03:36.741
Promise me.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.843
Fine, I won't let them
make you a vampire.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.047
Sheesh.

03:42.121 --> 03:44.352
Oh.
I'm glad you're here.

03:44.424 --> 03:46.950
We just had
a silly misunderstanding.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.358
[growls ]
No, no.

03:48.428 --> 03:49.691
N-no, please, no.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.025
No, no, no!

03:51.097 --> 03:54.363
Billy? Billy?!

03:54.434 --> 03:56.096
Master Billy left
with his visitors.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.934
Robo-Bo!
Get the Conject-U-Cycle!

03:59.005 --> 04:01.031
["Dixie" horn blares ]

04:03.643 --> 04:06.772
I have a check here
for $50,000

04:06.846 --> 04:09.281
for whoever helps me
rescue Billy from vampires.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.147
We're not mercenaries,
White.

04:11.217 --> 04:14.381
We handle the guys that nobody
else wants to deal with.

04:14.454 --> 04:15.547
Well, that's perfect,

04:15.622 --> 04:17.055
'cause nobody else
wants to deal with me.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.285
Yeah, you're not
getting it.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.624
Hunter, why don't you explain
what we do here at Sphinx?

04:21.694 --> 04:23.890
- Sphinx!
- It works like this --

04:23.963 --> 04:26.125
if someone points a gun at you,
ya call the police.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.963
If a bunch of guys
are pointing guns at you,

04:28.034 --> 04:28.865
you call S.W.A.T.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.927
If they're in spandex and
pointing a super laser at you,

04:31.004 --> 04:32.370
you call the O.S.I.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.770
If they're dressed regular

04:33.840 --> 04:35.832
and they're pointing a super
laser at your daughter,

04:35.908 --> 04:37.467
that's when
you call Sphinx.

04:37.543 --> 04:38.476
Sphinx!

04:38.544 --> 04:40.479
So explain to me
why we'd give a squirt

04:40.546 --> 04:42.242
about your roommate being
abducted by vampires?

04:42.315 --> 04:44.375
We're talking
about Billy here!

04:44.450 --> 04:45.349
You guys owe him.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.148
You did the -- you know.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.552
Spit it out, White!
This is Sphinx!

04:48.621 --> 04:50.556
- Sphinx.
- We have no secrets here.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.818
When men live
and work together,

04:51.891 --> 04:53.917
it's imperative
that there are no secrets!

04:53.993 --> 04:55.256
I miss my breasts!

04:55.328 --> 04:57.923
Inside of me, there is a woman
screaming to be heard.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.523
I hit a dog
with my car last week

05:00.600 --> 05:02.569
but told the owner
I found him like that.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.433
I once jerked off
12 times in one day

05:04.504 --> 05:05.904
just to see if I could.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.305
I had an erotic dream about
Henry Rollins last night,

05:08.374 --> 05:09.774
and I'm straight
as an arrow.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.538
Remember that smell I told you
was the garbage?

05:11.611 --> 05:12.601
That was my ass.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.671
I had chicken tandoori
for lunch.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.511
Ya see?!
Men don't have secrets.

05:16.582 --> 05:17.845
Now, what are you
talking about?

05:17.917 --> 05:18.885
Fine.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.214
You used Billy as a pawn

05:20.286 --> 05:21.879
to infiltrate the Guild
of Calamitous Intent.

05:21.954 --> 05:22.944
You owe him.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.287
Son, that wasn't us.
That was the O.S.I.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.293
If I throw
this pen at your head,

05:27.360 --> 05:28.350
are you gonna blame me

05:28.428 --> 05:29.452
or have a little fist fight
with the pen?

05:29.529 --> 05:32.363
Now get out
and take your bribe with you.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.991
Wait!
Where did you get this?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.729
The vampires.
We get them every--

05:35.802 --> 05:36.770
Finally!

05:36.836 --> 05:38.828
Samson, Shoreleave,
we got these bastards!

05:38.905 --> 05:39.770
Take a look at this!

05:39.839 --> 05:42.365
It's The Investors all right.
You have more of these?

05:42.442 --> 05:44.468
That's the last one.
We spent the others.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.206
Well, you're in luck, White.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.214
You're the only person that's
taken money from The Investors

05:48.281 --> 05:49.715
and lived
to panic about it.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.149
So you'll take the job?
- Take the job?

05:52.218 --> 05:54.278
Pale face, we've been waiting
for this job.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.346
You're not gonna be able
to get rid of Sphinx!

05:56.422 --> 05:57.754
Sphinx!

05:59.759 --> 06:02.024
Aah!
Geez, you're monstrous.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.189
[deep voice]
Close. I'm Monstroso.

06:04.263 --> 06:05.697
Leave us.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.028
Who are those guys?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.830
The Investors?

06:08.901 --> 06:10.369
They make dreams come true...

06:10.436 --> 06:11.529
for a price.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.470
And who the hell are you?

06:13.539 --> 06:17.306
A man, just like you,
in need of The Investors.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.312
We're all in the same boat,
Billy.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.245
How do you know my name?

06:21.314 --> 06:23.579
You're one of the most talented
surgeons alive.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.049
Who doesn't know of Dr. --
wait.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.051
You're not a doctor.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.714
You never went
to medical school.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.279
Well, some of the world's
greatest artists

06:30.356 --> 06:31.824
are self-taught, you know.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.292
Yes, and so many of them
live in sad trailers

06:34.360 --> 06:36.522
infested with albinos,

06:36.596 --> 06:38.895
scurrying from Xbox
to Playstation,

06:38.965 --> 06:41.025
living off
<i>your</i> accomplishments.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.728
I'm fine, all right?

06:42.802 --> 06:44.236
I just want to give
everything back.

06:44.303 --> 06:45.362
I just want to go home.

06:45.438 --> 06:46.701
Get back in bed,
little guy.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.264
Let me tuck you in.

06:48.341 --> 06:51.743
You can never go back to your
sad little life.

06:51.811 --> 06:52.904
Oh, is that too tight?

06:52.979 --> 06:55.073
There's no blood
getting to my face.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.744
No, Billy, we both made
a deal with The Investors.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.582
What -- what deal
did I make!?!

07:00.653 --> 07:02.019
I said
I'll give the money back!

07:02.088 --> 07:04.990
It's too late, Billy.
Now get some sleep.

07:05.057 --> 07:08.186
I want you well-rested to accept
The Investors' real gift --

07:08.261 --> 07:09.524
immortality!

07:09.595 --> 07:14.124
I run out, and I swear I see
Billy and the vampire guys

07:14.200 --> 07:15.600
disappear into thin air.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.159
It should have been me.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.205
Hey, it'll be fine.
We'll save him.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.797
It should have been me.

07:20.873 --> 07:23.035
I-I have that Malfoy,
Spike thing going on.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.010
I-I look way more vampire
than Billy.

07:25.077 --> 07:25.942
Should've been me.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.538
The footprints seem to start
and end right here.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.209
Shoreleave,
run this footprint soil

07:31.284 --> 07:33.219
through your thingy and see
what's going on here.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.447
Lemonade, gentlemen?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.386
Sweet lord,
what the hell is that?!

07:36.456 --> 07:37.617
Robo-Bo.

07:37.690 --> 07:38.851
Yeah, I got it
off the internet.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.655
They also make
a Robo-Starsky,

07:40.726 --> 07:42.957
Robo-Crockett,
and Robo-The-Fatman.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.019
It's disgusting!

07:44.096 --> 07:46.429
Why does it walk
like it has to take a dump?

07:46.499 --> 07:48.695
Oh, here's something.
There's salt in their tracks --

07:48.768 --> 07:49.963
ocean water.

07:50.036 --> 07:53.734
Saline at 3.4 -- Atlantic,
somewhere near the equator.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.741
Then that's
where we're going!

07:55.808 --> 07:57.140
You ever fix our submarine?

07:57.210 --> 07:59.941
Puhlease! We just shoveled dirt
on what was left of it.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.480
I think
I can get us a boat.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.516
If we're taking
a boat somewhere,

08:03.583 --> 08:04.744
we got to stop
for sunscreen.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.786
You're a civilian,
and you're annoying.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.015
This is a job for Sphinx.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.814
What?

08:11.891 --> 08:12.915
I thought you were gonna --

08:12.992 --> 08:14.221
Oh. Uh, Sphinx!

08:14.293 --> 08:16.319
Oh we'll rescue
your little friend.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.590
Yeah, friend -- friend.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.132
But you're going
to a safe house.

08:20.199 --> 08:23.966
I know what you're thinking --
that's a bunion.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.334
I thought that, too.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.168
But does a bunion
leak yellow goo

08:27.240 --> 08:28.731
when you squeeze it?

08:28.808 --> 08:29.935
No, it doesn't.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.342
So we have
a little mystery here.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.505
Yeah, would you like
to touch it?

08:34.580 --> 08:36.275
Uh, nah, not really.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.783
C'mon!
It's really mushy in there.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.018
Aw, ya look great.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.785

ya got.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.325
I'm with Sphinx now.
- Sphinx!

08:46.392 --> 08:49.487
Is Jonas here?
Sorry. Bad news, gentlemen.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.030
Jonas is gone.
He's up there.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.395
Oh, geez.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.024
I'm sorry, man.
We didn't know.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.001
Ah, no, no, no.
He's not dead.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.934
He's up
on his space-station thingy.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.939
Left me here
to keep the museum open.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.440
Since he left,
I've had, uh --

09:01.507 --> 09:03.373
let's see, uh --
no visitors.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.104
Not here to see the museum.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.737
Too bad, I could have cut
you guys a sweet group rate.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.714
Oh, hey.
Sorry, grandpa.

09:09.782 --> 09:12.377
Smoking cigarettes is illegal
on Spider Skull Island.

09:12.451 --> 09:13.851
What, are you kidding me?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.889
No. The wee chairman
outlawed them.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.924
This here island
is a sovereign nation.

09:17.990 --> 09:18.980
We got our own laws!

09:19.058 --> 09:20.651
Cigarettes and liquor
be banned,

09:20.726 --> 09:23.457
uh, but on the upside,
we grow our own pot,

09:23.529 --> 09:24.394
and we legalized
the gay marriage!

09:24.463 --> 09:25.829
I am gonna retire here.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.231
Captain, we just came here
to borrow the X2.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.496
Uh, no can do.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.539
Chairman needed the engine to
power part of that flying thingy

09:32.605 --> 09:34.335
he thinks is
too good for pirates.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.670
The X2 is gutted.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.233
Great. No boat.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.337
Yeah, well,
if ya just need a boat,

09:40.413 --> 09:42.575
I can help you there.
Just let me change me outfit.

09:42.648 --> 09:43.911
Oh, good.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.645
You put on
your little outfit.

09:45.718 --> 09:48.347
I almost didn't give it to you
because it was so small.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.413
I wanted to hang it
from my rear-view mirror.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.481
If anybody would be
sensitive to my size,

09:52.558 --> 09:53.890
I figured it would be you.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.895
I am kidding.
I'm sensitive to size.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.227
Not as much as I am
at this moment.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.424
And admit it.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.091
I've been showing you
a good time.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.830
Well, the indoor mini golf
was cool,

10:03.903 --> 10:05.132
and the bumper cars
would've been cool

10:05.204 --> 10:07.105
if yours wasn't as big
as an S.U.V.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.905
Well, I'm trying to enjoy my
last moments with this body.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.536
I've worked myself
to death.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.547
Now I'll play myself to death.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.708
I don't want to do this.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.341
I-I'm not ready.
- You are ready, Billy.

10:18.417 --> 10:19.715
You have nothing
in your life.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.981
The Investors are going
to change all of that.

10:22.054 --> 10:25.456
It's just -- I mean, there are
still so many things

10:25.524 --> 10:27.618
I want to do before I become,
you know, immortal.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.218
Well, after our game,
we still have

10:29.295 --> 10:31.696
bumper pool
and laser tag and --

10:31.764 --> 10:34.233
ooh, you'll love this --
giant legos.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.462
I was talking about something
a little more adult.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.299
Giant...checkers?

10:39.372 --> 10:42.103
Hmm. It's kind of small
for a pirate ship.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.574
She's almost brigantine.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.635
Found an old sloop
and changed her rigging.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.577
The rest is
from a theme-park ride.

10:47.647 --> 10:52.142
But she's fast, seaworthy, and
probably a mighty chick magnet.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.210
She'll have to do.
What do you call her?

10:54.286 --> 10:55.754
I call her
<i>Manny's Song.</i>

10:55.821 --> 10:56.914
Who's Manny?

10:56.989 --> 10:58.116
Me first love.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.058
She left me
for a bloke named Craig,

11:01.127 --> 11:02.755
who just slept with her
and tossed her away.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.387
Haven't seen her since then.

11:04.463 --> 11:07.922
I heard she was with some
go-nowhere mechanic named Jay.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.764
Sad.
Does she know how you feel?

11:09.835 --> 11:13.328
Um, no, she doesn't, because
that's all from a TV show.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.137
Captain Cuckoo here
named his boat

11:16.208 --> 11:17.198
after Manny Santos
on "Degrassi."

11:17.276 --> 11:18.505
You're a liar!

11:18.577 --> 11:20.603
I can't believe
they killed J.T.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.615
I know!
And they hardly talked about it,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.947
like after Terri bashed
her skull on that rock.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.679
Yeah.
I'm the liar, me.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.744

aren't embarrassed,

Yes. Of course.

has access
to the Guild funds.

Billy's hand

13:42.188 --> 13:43.451
It's not accurate,
but it should get us

13:43.522 --> 13:45.821
close enough to activate
the hand's homing device.

13:45.891 --> 13:46.915
Anything on that check?

the peanut-butter prints

See?

You know why
that looks crappy?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.366
Because that's not
a palm print.

16:43.302 --> 16:44.793
With Brock and Shoreleave,

16:44.870 --> 16:46.133
we just need alibis
and body bags.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.867
Ta-da!

16:47.940 --> 16:50.466
Genital formal wear.
I'm ready.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.534
You're not wearing that,
are you?

16:52.611 --> 16:54.603
This little get-up-and-go works
like a samurai mask.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.672
They'll get a gander
at this little number,

16:56.749 --> 16:58.240
and they're hypnotized!

16:58.317 --> 17:00.047
All right.
It's a dual mission.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.610
One, rescue the little guy.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.417
Two, terminate Monstroso,
The Investors,

17:04.490 --> 17:06.152
and everything that gets
in your way.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.387
You just reminded me
why I joined Sphinx.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.290
Sphinx!

17:14.333 --> 17:17.701
Oh, my god!
This water is fucking freezing!

17:17.770 --> 17:19.568

17:19.637 --> 17:22.198
[sighs ]
Okay, I've signed it.

17:22.273 --> 17:23.674
Now make me a vampire.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.176
I'm ready to become
one of the undead.

17:26.244 --> 17:27.736
The blood is the life!

17:27.813 --> 17:29.577
What are you talking about?
Vampire?

17:29.648 --> 17:31.583
I can't make you a vampire.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.516
What? Isn't that what
this is all about --

17:33.585 --> 17:35.577
these papers,
the vampire brides,

17:35.654 --> 17:37.589
the immortality crap,
those guys?

17:37.656 --> 17:38.521
Leave us.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.754
You have me and The Investors
all wrong, son.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.352
Those papers you just signed --

17:43.429 --> 17:47.093
those are your diplomas from
medical school, all legal.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.032
That is your gift.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.263
But those women said
they were vampires.

17:51.336 --> 17:52.770
Those women were
prostitutes.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.739
They would have said they were
Charlie's Angels

17:54.807 --> 17:56.105
if you wanted them to.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.701
But -- but -- but you kept
talking about immorality

17:58.777 --> 17:59.710
and your new life.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.041
Yes, immortality.

18:01.113 --> 18:03.275
You've been brought here to
perform a heart transplant.

18:05.951 --> 18:09.353
King Gorilla made a little deal
with The Investors and I.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.219
He gets out
of his life sentence

18:11.290 --> 18:13.452
and I get his heart
when he dies.

18:13.525 --> 18:14.959
Oh, come on.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.188
Every fucking time!

18:16.261 --> 18:17.627
I should have guessed.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.722
I got kidnapped to perform
another illegal surgery.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.892
No. This surgery is legal.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.732
We are far
from U.S. Restrictions.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.294
And with your new diploma,

18:26.371 --> 18:29.705
you will get the credit, fame,
and fortune you deserve.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.142
You will be a legend,
an immortal.

If you even think about it,
I pull the trigger.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.637
Okay. Just take that gun off
of my back.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.175
No, no. That's not my gun.

you were behind them.

Magic guys.
That sucks.

the money from?

to know about.
