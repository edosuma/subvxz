00:04.178 --> 00:06.658
- Attention, everyone,
a bomb was just found on a bus

00:06.702 --> 00:07.572
in Downtown Brooklyn.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.096
- Oh, my God, a bomb on a bus.

00:09.139 --> 00:11.054
It's a "Speed"?
I get to work a "Speed"?

00:11.098 --> 00:12.621
- That sentence is nonsensical.

00:12.664 --> 00:13.752
One can work with speed,

00:13.796 --> 00:15.363
but one certainly
cannot work a speed.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.365
- "Speed" is a movie.
I won't let you ruin this!

00:17.408 --> 00:18.801
- Really never seen
"Speed," sir?

00:18.844 --> 00:20.194
Keanu Reeves, Sandy Bullock,

00:20.237 --> 00:21.804
Jeff Daniels at the height
of his sexual powers?

00:21.847 --> 00:23.023
- Can we please just focus!

00:23.066 --> 00:24.372
The bomb could go off
at any moment.

00:24.415 --> 00:27.157
- Actually, it can't.
It's already been defused.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.898
- Oh, well, there's still
a bomber on the loose.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.160
You can't ruin this!

00:30.204 --> 00:31.248
All right,
tell me about the bus.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.380
Was it headed
to the courthouse?

00:32.423 --> 00:34.947
- It wasn't an MTA bus.
It was that.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.253
A "Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"
tour bus.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.863
- No, you're not ruining this!

00:37.907 --> 00:39.169
Has anyone heard
from the bomber?

00:39.213 --> 00:40.562
Has he made any demands?

00:40.605 --> 00:43.130
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Special Agent Feingold, FBI.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.088
This is our case.
You're not a part of it.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.612
- Oh, man!
You ruined it!

00:50.615 --> 00:57.579
<i>♪</i>

01:07.589 --> 01:09.678
Agent Feingold, our guys
were on the scene first.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.071
We're not gonna
let you take the case.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.202
Tell him, sir.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.377

take the case.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.944
- What?
But I said that so cool!

01:14.987 --> 01:16.685
- They're the feds.
They have jurisdiction.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.556
Agent Feingold, call me
if you need anything.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.210
- Sorry, guy,
guess you're just gonna have

01:20.254 --> 01:22.299
to let the big boys handle it.
- Please just let us help you.

01:22.343 --> 01:23.779
This is
an all-hands-on-deck situation.

01:23.822 --> 01:26.260
I could be a good resource.
Here, watch this.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.218
What's up, Officer Marzipan?
- Oh, hey.

01:28.262 --> 01:29.524
- You're gonna want
that kind of shorthand

01:29.567 --> 01:31.134
with Marzipan if you
want to catch this guy.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.440
- We don't need
all hands on deck.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.442
The bomb was rigged
with a chintzy $4 watch

01:34.485 --> 01:36.313
set to explode at 12:00 a.m.
- Midnight?

01:36.357 --> 01:37.923
But there wouldn't be
anybody on it.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.577
- Yeah, the idiot clearly meant
to set it for noon.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.231
We're not dealing
with a mastermind here.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.624
I'm sure there's prints
all over the place

01:42.667 --> 01:44.278
- I don't know--I've just got
a gut feeling

01:44.321 --> 01:46.454
there's more to this.
- Oh, a gut feeling?

01:46.497 --> 01:48.717
You know what your gut tells
you to do most of the time?

01:48.760 --> 01:50.066
Take a dump.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.764
And you just took a big one
all over yourself.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.421
- Okay, well, I don't have
a comeback for that,

01:57.465 --> 01:59.423
so I'm just gonna go.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.686
Agent Feingold.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.996
- Scully, it's our favorite
time of year.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.781
Cagney and Lacey's
annual school candy drive!

02:09.825 --> 02:11.261
I took the liberty
of duplicating

02:11.305 --> 02:12.784
your order from last year.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.482
Simply sign at the X,
and I'll get it placed for you.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.266
- Oh, about that, I don't know

02:16.310 --> 02:18.094
if I'm gonna buy anything
from you this year.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.487
- What?

02:19.530 --> 02:22.185
But we've been in business
together since pre-K.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.882
- I know,
but there's someone else.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.057
- Someone else?

02:25.101 --> 02:26.407
- It's not you.
It's me.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.799
My taste in candy changed.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.975
- Look, everyone goes
through rough patches,

02:30.019 --> 02:31.412
but we can't give up.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.283
You owe it to Cagney and Lacey.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.980
- Please don't bring
the kids into this.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.200
- The kids are a part of it
whether you like it or not.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.507
Who are you buying from?
Tell me, now!

02:39.550 --> 02:41.726
- The other man is me.

02:41.770 --> 02:45.774
Nikolaj is selling candy
this year, too.

02:45.817 --> 02:48.603
- You're cheating on me
with Boyle?

02:48.646 --> 02:51.301
- Oh, there she is,
my archnemesis.

02:51.345 --> 02:52.520
- You're a cop, O'Sullivan.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.130
shouldn't your archnemesis
be a criminal?

02:54.174 --> 02:57.177
- No.
- Okay, what do you want?

02:57.220 --> 02:58.569
- Well, I came here
to reach a truce

02:58.613 --> 03:00.528
with you over your
pilot program that persecutes

03:00.571 --> 03:02.530
the uniformed officers
in my union.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.706
- Its aim is to reduce
instances in which armed cops

03:04.749 --> 03:06.838
are needlessly interacting
with civilians.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.841
It could save lives and restore
trust with the community.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.321
- That's persecution,
plain and simple.

03:11.365 --> 03:12.801
But I don't want
to fight with you.

03:12.844 --> 03:14.846
I'd rather be civilized
and reach some common ground

03:14.890 --> 03:16.587
over a drink.
- It's the middle of the day.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.850
- Well, that's how business
gets done in the real world.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.548
- Look, I'm not changing
the pilot program.

03:20.591 --> 03:22.245
- Okay, have it your way,

03:22.289 --> 03:25.248
but I got to say,
you're going to be sorry.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.728
- Are you threatening me?

03:26.771 --> 03:28.686
- No, I'm informing you
that I hold a lot of power,

03:28.730 --> 03:30.340
and unless you're willing
to play ball with me,

03:30.384 --> 03:32.212
I will wield said power
against you.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.604
Again, not a threat,

03:33.648 --> 03:35.737
but go ahead
and change your mind, or else.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.652
All the best.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.697
- So you lost a "Speed."
That sucks.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.525
At least you didn't have
a "Sister Act" taken from you.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.700
- Bracco confessed.

03:42.744 --> 03:43.962
The undercover operation
is over.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.790
- But I just got a spot
in the choir.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.357
- Wait, is that the real reason
you left the force?

03:47.401 --> 03:48.576
- It didn't help.
- Right.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.099
Look, I don't care
that I lost a "Speed."

03:50.142 --> 03:52.362
I care that the FBI is not
taking the case seriously.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.972
They think the bomber
is just some idiot,

03:54.016 --> 03:55.409
but what if he's not an idiot?

03:55.452 --> 03:57.846
What if he wanted it
to go off at midnight?

03:57.889 --> 03:59.543
Oh, my God.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.284
He wanted it
to go off at midnight.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.459
- Why? Wouldn't it just be

04:02.503 --> 04:03.721
an empty parking lot
with nobody in it?

04:03.765 --> 04:05.245
- Yeah, but there could be
a target there,

04:05.288 --> 04:06.768
which he would try
to hit again.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.291
There's gonna be a second bomb,
just like in "Speed"!

04:08.335 --> 04:09.988

a "Speed" again!

being a "Speed"!

04:12.730 --> 04:14.863
That's all I care about!
I've got to go!

You can't judge a book

07:25.009 --> 07:26.446
on his way home when it's open,

07:26.489 --> 07:28.230
and it was open because
Peralta picked the lock.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.927
- What a bunch of bunk.

07:29.971 --> 07:32.190
Why'd the perp run away unless
he was guilty of something?

07:32.234 --> 07:33.931
- Because he was
understandably scared

07:33.975 --> 07:35.150
of interacting with a cop.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.543
- I see--
well, that excuse hasn't worked

07:36.586 --> 07:38.545
in the last
15 cases against Marzipan,

07:38.588 --> 07:39.633
and I don't think
it'll work now.

07:39.676 --> 07:40.938
- 15?

07:40.982 --> 07:42.984
- Peralta, I can make
all of this disappear.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.464
That's what
the police union does.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.466
But you got
to play ball with me, son.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.815
What do you say?

07:47.858 --> 07:51.079
- Sir, can I speak with you
in private, please?

07:51.122 --> 07:52.559
I just had an epiphany.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.256
- That you're fallible
and you made an M word.

07:54.299 --> 07:58.173
- Absolutely not.
This whole thing is a setup!

07:58.216 --> 08:02.133
- ♪ Oh,
who could take a sunrise ♪

08:02.177 --> 08:05.441
♪ Sprinkle it with dew

08:05.485 --> 08:07.008
♪ Cover it in chocolate

08:07.051 --> 08:08.879
♪ And a miracle or two?

08:08.923 --> 08:11.099
♪ The candy man can

08:11.142 --> 08:13.710
- Wow, so you're just gonna
do your business

08:13.754 --> 08:16.496
all out in the open
like some common candy ho?

08:16.539 --> 08:18.410
- You're just jealous.
- Boyle, where's my candy?

08:18.454 --> 08:19.934
- What?
- The box is full of sand.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.545
Or maybe it's sugar.
Oh, it's not sugar.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.460
It's sand.
Is this some sort of sick joke?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.853
- There was candy
in there earlier.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.811
Maybe it fell out?
- I don't want excuses, bitch!

08:27.855 --> 08:28.943
I want my candy!

08:28.986 --> 08:30.031
The vending machine is broken,

08:30.074 --> 08:31.119
and you're
my only snack source.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.250
- He doesn't have to be.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.165
I still have
your purchase order.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.602
- You.
You did this.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.169
- Please, I would never do
something that childish,

08:38.213 --> 08:40.302
and you would know that if you
weren't a big, stinky dumb-dumb

08:40.345 --> 08:41.521
who smelled like butts.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.479
- Okay, so here's
what I'm thinking.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.655
The union set me up.
Think about it.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.352
O'Sullivan told Amy if she
didn't drop her pilot program,

08:47.396 --> 08:49.180
"she'd be sorry,"
and now suddenly,

08:49.224 --> 08:50.355
I'm being threatened
with suspension?

08:50.399 --> 08:51.879
- Sure, but he
threatened her, not you.

08:51.922 --> 08:52.836
- We're married.
We're a team.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.359
- Really?

08:54.403 --> 08:56.187
What about when I wanted
to run a half marathon together

08:56.231 --> 08:57.537
and you told me to rot in hell?

08:57.580 --> 08:59.147
- That was clearly
a playful joke.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.627
- So will you run
the half marathon with me?

09:00.670 --> 09:02.367
- No, I would die!

09:02.411 --> 09:04.065
Look, O'Sullivan said he could
make my suspension go away

09:04.108 --> 09:05.370
if just "played ball."

09:05.414 --> 09:06.546
He's clearly trying to get me

09:06.589 --> 09:08.112
to lean on you
to kill your program.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.549
- This doesn't sound
like a setup.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.202
O'Sullivan didn't make you
arrest an innocent man.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.682
- Or did he?
Think about it.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.423
Marzipan, who I never liked,
by the way,

09:14.466 --> 09:16.251
was the one who gave me
the address to the bus lot.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.774
I think he
and O'Sullivan made sure

09:17.818 --> 09:19.602
there was a "suspect" there
for me to arrest.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.256
- You think the victim
was a plant?

09:21.299 --> 09:23.127
- I didn't believe it either
until I checked the guy's file.

09:23.171 --> 09:24.651
Guess what he does
for a living?

09:24.694 --> 09:26.696
Actor.
Huh?

09:26.740 --> 09:29.481
Come on, sir, you hate actors!
- I don't hate actors.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.701
I hate colleges
that award diplomas for acting.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.616
- I mean, I wouldn't put it
past O'Sullivan.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.575
He is desperate to kill
our reform program.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.402
- True, he tried
to blackmail me before.

09:37.446 --> 09:38.752
- If you don't give me
what I want,

09:38.795 --> 09:40.884
I will release proof
that you are a homosexual.

09:40.928 --> 09:44.105
- I came out 30 years ago.
- Ah, you're impossible.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.586
- So you agree it was a setup.
I have your unbridled support?

09:46.629 --> 09:48.413
- My support is
extremely bridled.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.502
You have circumstantial
evidence at best.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.287
- All right, then I guess
we just have to prove it.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.767
- Absolutely not.

09:53.810 --> 09:56.030
You can't investigate
your accuser.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.379
It's retaliation.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.989
- Which is why
the investigation will focus

09:59.033 --> 10:01.513
only on O'Sullivan and be led
by someone from the outside.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.472
A friend, a confidant, a--

10:03.515 --> 10:05.648
- Diaz.
- Yes.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.129
Damn it, you kind of stepped
on the dramatic entrance

10:08.172 --> 10:09.434
we had planned,
and you threw off our...

10:09.478 --> 10:11.001
- Me.
- Timing.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.568
The point is Amy and Rosa
will head up the investigation,

10:12.612 --> 10:13.656
and the entrance
worked perfectly.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.657
- Interesting, you two are sure

10:14.701 --> 10:15.919
you want
to be involved with this?

10:15.963 --> 10:17.268
- Investigating O'Sullivan?

10:17.312 --> 10:18.792
Yeah, that dude sucks.
He tried to blackmail me.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.663
- If you don't stop harassing
my officers,

10:20.707 --> 10:22.534
I will release proof
that you are bisexual.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.275
- Already came out.
- Oh, come on.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.234
You can't blackmail
anyone anymore.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.627
- Okay, so here's the plan.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.759
O'Sullivan likes to do deals
over drinks.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.848
<i>So I invite him to Shaw's
and order us a couple beers.</i>

10:31.892 --> 10:33.545
<i>I nod along as he talks</i>

10:33.589 --> 10:35.199
<i>about how surprisingly cool
his mom is.</i>

10:35.243 --> 10:36.374
<i>Order more beers.</i>

10:36.418 --> 10:37.637
<i>I also nod along as he talks</i>

10:37.680 --> 10:39.290
<i>about how horrible
his ex-wife is.</i>

10:39.334 --> 10:40.727
<i>Order more beers.</i>

10:40.770 --> 10:42.337
<i>I also nod along as
he kind of implies</i>

10:42.380 --> 10:43.599
<i>he wishes
his wife was his mom.</i>

10:43.643 --> 10:45.993
- Nobody spoons like my mom.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.951
<i>- But I'm not the only one
who's one listening.</i>

10:47.995 --> 10:49.126
<i>O'Sullivan's a blowhard,</i>

10:49.170 --> 10:50.693
<i>so he just needs
a little push.</i>

10:50.737 --> 10:52.956
<i>Get him drunk enough,
eventually he'll just come out</i>

10:53.000 --> 10:54.610
<i>and admit that he set Jake up.</i>

10:54.654 --> 10:55.742
<i>The plan is flawless.</i>

10:55.785 --> 10:58.527
So there's one flaw
with my plan.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.311
- O'Sullivan isn't even buzzed,
and you're totally hammered?

11:00.355 --> 11:02.444
- I'm so hammered!

11:05.316 --> 11:06.666
- Pizza delivery
for Jake Peralta.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.667
- Oh, that's me.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.972
I didn't order a pizza, though.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.104
Someone must know
I've been having a hard day.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.323
- You've been served.
- What? Come on!

11:12.367 --> 11:16.110
<i>- Been there, brother.
What did you get served?</i>

11:16.153 --> 11:17.328
- Oh, you.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.200
I'm being sued
for wrongful arrest.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.158
<i>- No, I don't care about that.
I'm talking pizza toppings.</i>

11:21.202 --> 11:23.117
<i>The District Court
does a great pepperoni.</i>

11:23.160 --> 11:24.553
- You know what?
Why are you even talking to me?

11:24.596 --> 11:26.163
Scully's taking a nap.
What are you doing on there?

11:26.207 --> 11:27.774
<i>- I miss my old role
in the Nine-Nine--</i>

11:27.817 --> 11:29.166
<i>Hitchcock, the wise sage,</i>

11:29.210 --> 11:31.038
<i>always helping people
through their troubles.</i>

11:31.081 --> 11:32.822
- That was never your role.
Wait a minute.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.128
This address.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.346
The guy said he
lived up by the bus lot

11:35.390 --> 11:36.696
and that's why
he was cutting through,

11:36.739 --> 11:38.001
but according to this,

11:38.045 --> 11:39.829
his address
isn't anywhere near that lot.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.788
He lied.
This is huge.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.267
I got to call Amy and Rosa.

11:43.311 --> 11:46.009
- And that is why
"Kristy and the Snobs"

11:46.053 --> 11:47.881
is the best
Baby-Sitters Club Book ever.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.840
Hey, we should go
fly-fishing sometimes.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.320
- That's never gonna happen.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.017
We need to sober you up
and get you back out there.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.192
Coffee and carbs usually work,

11:55.236 --> 11:56.846
so here's what
we're gonna to do.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.935
- Ow! Rosa!
What about the carbs?

11:58.979 --> 12:00.807
- That was a misdirection.
Carbs never work.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.026
Slapping's the only way.
- Oh, I think it worked.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.985
And I just want to say,
what makes

12:05.028 --> 12:07.770
"Kristy and the Snobs"
so good is the snobs.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.467
Their names
are Tiffany and Shannon,

12:09.511 --> 12:11.861
and they laugh at Louie
even though he's going blind,

12:11.905 --> 12:13.297
which is so sad.
- Okay.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.690
I'm calling Holt.
This is a failure.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.736
- No, wait, wait.
I have an idea.

12:16.779 --> 12:17.867
- Oh, I bet it's great.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.303
- Okay, you know how guys
like O'Sullivan,

12:19.347 --> 12:21.044
they think
we all look the same, right?

12:21.088 --> 12:23.438
So you dress as Amy.
You take my place.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.614
And, oh, my God!
Is nine-drink Amy a genius?

12:25.657 --> 12:27.007
- That's never gonna work.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.791
You just need to sober up
and get back out there.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.402
Oh, you're on the floor.
-

12:33.100 --> 12:35.885
- What's going on here?
- Uh, nothing.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.147
- Nothing?

12:37.191 --> 12:38.540
I distinctly remember
you saying

12:38.583 --> 12:39.889
we were moving on to shots.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.238
And yet you bring us
more beers?

12:41.282 --> 12:42.892
You got to do a better job
than that, Santiago.

12:42.936 --> 12:45.765
- Right, right, I guess we'll
just have to shoot these, then.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.767
- Yes, we will!

12:47.810 --> 12:50.813
- Sugar.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.380
♪ Oh, Scully, Scully

12:54.948 --> 12:57.254
♪ You are my candy friend

12:57.298 --> 12:59.909
- Boring!
No costume change much?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.911
- What the heck?
This isn't my order.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.217
- What, did they give you
sour straws

13:03.260 --> 13:04.784
instead of sour ropes?
I specifically said--

13:04.827 --> 13:07.264
- No, it's just apples!

13:07.308 --> 13:08.918
Terry, you sick son of a bitch.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.659
- I didn't do it!
Boyle must have!

13:10.702 --> 13:11.921
- I would never do that.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.836
This is just what happens
when you order candy

13:13.880 --> 13:15.490
from a candy child
and not a candy man.

13:15.533 --> 13:19.450
- I'll show you a candy man.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.061
- Hey, what the hell?

13:21.104 --> 13:23.672
Oh, you picked the wrong guy
to get in an apple fight with.

13:23.715 --> 13:24.847
- Why is that?

13:24.891 --> 13:26.022
- Because I was MVP

13:26.066 --> 13:27.937
of my fast-pitch
softball summer camp.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.852
- Wow, I'm so scared--

13:29.896 --> 13:31.723
Oh!

13:31.767 --> 13:32.986
Ow.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.291
- There you are.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.510
I found proof
that this was a setup.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.207
Look, the victim lied
about his address.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.296
Zip!
- What's that?

13:39.340 --> 13:40.820
- That's the sound
of your bridle unzipping.

13:40.863 --> 13:41.995
Unbridled support from earlier?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.518
- You don't know
what a bridle is, do you?

13:43.561 --> 13:45.215
- I do not.
We're getting sidetracked.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.130
Once I realized he was lying,
I looked at his social media.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.784
He starts rehearsals
for a rock musical

13:48.828 --> 13:50.351
in Florida on Monday.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.092
- That tracks. Theater like
that belongs in the swamps.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.571
- Well, yeah, obviously,
I can't disagree,

13:53.615 --> 13:55.138
but the point is
we're running out of time.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.313
I should tail him
and figure out

13:56.357 --> 13:57.575
what he's up to
before he skips town.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.795
- You'll do no such thing.
We have a plan.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.449
Santiago and Diaz
are with O'Sullivan.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.277
They have it under control.
- Are you sure?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.669
'Cause I keep calling them,
and they're not answering.

14:04.713 --> 14:07.542
- Have faith in them.
They're professionals.

14:07.585 --> 14:08.804
- I'm so drunk.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.936
He's had 14 beers,

14:09.979 --> 14:11.546
and he's not even
slurring his words.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.026
- Well, I feel better.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.679
I had some floor pretzels.
Let's switch places again.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.465
- Yes, two of us can outdrink
that son of a bitch.

14:17.508 --> 14:20.033
- Here's to you, Santiago.
All the best, bottoms up.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.599
Whoa, Nelly!

14:24.646 --> 14:25.908
<i>♪</i>

14:25.952 --> 14:26.953
Here's to you.

14:26.996 --> 14:30.086
<i>♪</i>

14:30.130 --> 14:31.609
How about it?

14:31.653 --> 14:34.525
<i>♪</i>

14:34.569 --> 14:37.006
Well, now, what the hell
am I looking at?

14:37.050 --> 14:38.703
Nothing.

14:38.747 --> 14:39.922
- Oops.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.750
- You're drunk,
and you're seeing double.

14:41.793 --> 14:42.925
- Oh, give me a break.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.535
You can't really think
I'm that stupid.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.015
- I mean,
we've been switching places

14:46.059 --> 14:47.974
for the last two hours,
and you didn't notice, so...

14:48.017 --> 14:49.540
- That's 'cause I don't look
at women's eyes

14:49.584 --> 14:50.846
when I'm talking to 'em.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.326
Now, what's going on?
- You set up my husband!

14:52.369 --> 14:53.936
You're using him
to blackmail me

14:53.980 --> 14:55.285
into dropping police reform.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.200
We're getting you drunk
so you can admit it.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.723
- I'm not blackmailing Jake.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.987
When I blackmail somebody,
you'll know it.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.379
I own my blackmailing.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.207
- Then what did you mean
when you said I'd be sorry

15:04.251 --> 15:05.948
if I didn't drop police reform?

15:05.992 --> 15:08.342
- I was talking
about taking your snacks.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.170
- Huh?
- Oh, come on.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.736
Who do you think
broke the vending machine

15:11.780 --> 15:13.651
that got Detective Flat Top
all riled up,

15:13.695 --> 15:16.524
stole Detective Little Guy's
candy shipment,

15:16.567 --> 15:19.788
and swapped out
Sergeant Muscle Guy's candy

15:19.831 --> 15:21.311
for seasonal fruit?

15:21.355 --> 15:22.704
- Your people.
- Bingo.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.967
And it's driving
your guys crazy.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.665
Now, if your precinct would
like to get their candy back.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.971
I'd be willing to negotiate.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.668
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.889
So when you told Jake you could
get him out of his suspension,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.369
that wasn't blackmail?

15:35.412 --> 15:37.414
- If I am passionate
about one thing,

15:37.458 --> 15:40.026
it's getting cops off
without punishment.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.680
How dare you turn that
into something dirty?

15:42.724 --> 15:44.073
Shame on the both of you.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.770
- Oh, we got to call Jake.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.513
Where is he?

15:49.557 --> 15:52.299
<i>♪</i>

15:54.344 --> 15:55.302
- Got ya.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.307
- This is Captain Holt.

16:00.350 --> 16:03.092
- Oh, hello, Captain.
It's Amy Santiag-ago.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.615
- Sergeant, are you drunk?
- Oh, he thinks I'm drunk.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.617
What do I do?
- Uh, British accent.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.532
- Smart.
That'll fool him.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.186
Yes, sir, quite drunk.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.709
Wankered, really.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.450
- What did you learn?
Did O'Sullivan set up Peralta?

16:13.494 --> 16:14.625
<i>- No, he didn't.</i>

16:14.669 --> 16:16.105
Me husband
wasn't set up at all.

16:16.149 --> 16:19.108
He wasn't,
but me big problem now

16:19.152 --> 16:21.632
is that me husband
can't be reached by me telly.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.025
- Please stop
talking like that.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.113
- Okay.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.680
- Peralta wanted
to tail the victim.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.203
I forbade him,
but I bet he did it anyway.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.509
I'll text you the address.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.598
-
Oh.

16:30.641 --> 16:31.947
We got to stop Jake.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.688
- How?
We're too drunk to drive.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.429
- True, but we're not
too drunk to pedal.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.390
Jake, oh, thank God
we found you in time.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.479
- We?
- Me and Rosa, duh.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.916
- Rosa's not with you.
- Right.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.007
I lost her when she rode down
the stairs to the subway.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.748
It was so funny!

16:50.792 --> 16:53.012
- Okay, just shh,
'cause my guy is in there.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.535
- By the way,
I really like that hat.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.710
You look like a little narc.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.581
- And you enjoy that?
- Oh, yeah.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.279
- Okay.
- But that's not why I'm here.

16:59.322 --> 17:00.715
O'Sullivan didn't set you up.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.369
- Wait, what?
Are you sure?

17:02.412 --> 17:05.328
- Yeah, all O'Sullivan did was
mess with the vending machine

17:05.372 --> 17:06.808
and Scully's candy.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.114
That was his blackmail.

17:08.157 --> 17:11.595
- Okay.
Wow, okay, that's bad.

17:11.639 --> 17:12.857
That guy's innocent,
and I arrested him,

17:12.901 --> 17:14.076
and now I'm tailing him.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.383
- I know!
Let's just go "herm"!

17:16.426 --> 17:17.775
- Jake!
Jake!

17:17.819 --> 17:21.083
Hey, Jake, you're following
an innocent man!

17:27.394 --> 17:29.657
- Hey, man.

17:29.700 --> 17:33.052
What are you doing here?
What a weird coincidence.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.141
-
Do a British accent.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.406
- Hey, Lieutenant,
I think we should talk.

17:39.449 --> 17:40.842
How you doing?

17:40.885 --> 17:43.279
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.281
Sir, I want to apologize.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.719
- Okay, I have no idea
what you're saying.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.504
Look, I know
the union set us up,

17:50.547 --> 17:51.809
but we let it happen.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.811
Your friendship
means the world to me,

17:53.855 --> 17:55.509
and I would hate
for it to be destroyed

17:55.552 --> 17:57.511
by a competition
to sell more candy.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.208
- Me too.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.558
<i>- You guys are selling candy?
There's nothing good here.</i>

18:01.602 --> 18:03.778
<i>Could one of you
ship to Brazil?</i>

18:07.216 --> 18:10.480
- Oh!
You sneaky son of a bitch!

18:10.524 --> 18:13.266
- We're adding intimidation
to the charges against you.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.659
- I know, you're both mad
and disappointed.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.835
- I'm neither.
I'm displeased.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.315
- Is that worse?
- Yes.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.970
Of my 16 potential reactions,
only one is stronger,

18:22.013 --> 18:25.191
and you should be thankful
you've never seen me huffy.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.931
- Well, you have
every right to be.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.237
I know I messed up.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.673
I just never imagined myself
as someone

18:29.717 --> 18:30.935
who would make
a mistake like that,

18:30.979 --> 18:33.373
and then I just
made it worse, you know?

18:33.416 --> 18:35.331
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

18:35.375 --> 18:36.680
Learning a lesson?

18:36.724 --> 18:38.117
You don't have
any lessons to learn.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.683
You didn't do anything wrong.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.251
- What do you want, O'Sullivan?
- This is Mel Jenkins--

18:42.295 --> 18:44.949
city attorney in charge
of payoffs and bribes.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.038
- Uh, not my title.
I handle tort claims.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.215
- Whatever. Mel and I just had
ourselves a little chat

18:49.258 --> 18:51.260
over morning drinks.
- More drinks?

18:51.304 --> 18:53.654
- Relax, it was just
a couple of breakfast beers.

18:53.697 --> 18:56.135
So the department
is going to settle

18:56.178 --> 18:58.180
without admitting
any wrongdoing,

18:58.224 --> 19:01.096
and because the facts of the
case will remain unresolved,

19:01.140 --> 19:04.839
there will be no suspension
for Marzipan or Peralta

19:04.882 --> 19:06.145
- How's that possible?

19:06.188 --> 19:08.016
Peralta arrested
and harassed an innocent man.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.670
- Come on, now, these are cops.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.193
They got to make
split-second decisions

19:11.237 --> 19:13.239
in life-or-death situations,
and they can't be expected

19:13.282 --> 19:15.893
to get that 100% correct
every single time.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.634
- This was not
a life-or-death situation.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.201
- Sure, but next time
it might be.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.203
And how can this one
be expected to do his job

19:21.247 --> 19:24.989
when he knows that any
teeny-tiny lapse in judgment

19:25.033 --> 19:27.035
could end with you
branding him a dirty cop

19:27.078 --> 19:29.342
and ruining his life?

19:29.385 --> 19:31.300
- Oh, I've never seen
this face before.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.476
Wait, is that--

19:33.520 --> 19:35.739
- Yes, he's made me huffy.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.698
Do you know what happens
when you refuse

19:37.741 --> 19:39.308
to punish cops
for their mistakes,

19:39.352 --> 19:41.789
when police are treated
as a separate class

19:41.832 --> 19:43.356
of citizen above the law?

19:43.399 --> 19:46.185
It breeds a lack of trust
in the community,

19:46.228 --> 19:48.274
and that lack of trust
means people won't help us

19:48.317 --> 19:50.450
with our investigations
or testify

19:50.493 --> 19:52.843
or even call us
when they're in danger.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.671
It makes them more scared of us

19:54.715 --> 19:56.630
than of criminals
and gangsters.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.458
It makes them run
when we approach,

19:58.501 --> 20:00.199
even though
they've done nothing wrong.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.679
It makes the people
see us as the enemy,

20:02.723 --> 20:04.812
which leads
to more confrontation,

20:04.855 --> 20:06.727
more distrust.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.772
You wonder how Peralta
can do his job

20:08.816 --> 20:10.296
when he's held accountable
for his actions?

20:10.339 --> 20:15.083
I wonder how any of us
can do our job if he's not.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.347
- What a bunch of bunk.
The city's gonna settle.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.219
There are not gonna be
any suspensions.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.222
Take the win.
- Wait.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.659
What if I admit I made
an error and apologize?

20:25.702 --> 20:27.051
- He is speaking
hypothetically.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.923
You'll notice he never used
the S word

20:28.966 --> 20:30.229
and he never used the M word.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.708
- I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

20:31.752 --> 20:32.927
- Holy [bleep]!

20:32.970 --> 20:34.189
Let the record show

20:34.233 --> 20:35.712
that he didn't say
anything specific.

20:35.756 --> 20:38.062
- I arrested a man without
a sufficient probable cause

20:38.106 --> 20:39.368
in a case I was removed from.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.196
- He has no idea
what he's talking about.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.067
- I then followed
my victim to his home...

20:43.111 --> 20:44.721
- Now's a good time
for us to leave.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.419
- In an act that could only
be seen as police intimidation.

20:46.462 --> 20:47.724
- La, la, la, la, la, la.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.335
- I take full responsibility
for my mistake,

20:49.378 --> 20:50.901
and I'm willing to say
as much in a court of law.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.207
- La, la, la, la, la, la.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.079
- And what's more,
I'm very, very sorry!

20:55.123 --> 20:57.865
- Yeah, he has to be suspended.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.388
I'm sorry.

20:59.432 --> 21:02.261
- Ah, don't you start.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.610
- Wow.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.307
That was amazing.
We beat him.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.744
I can't believe it
actually worked out okay.

21:07.788 --> 21:08.919
- You're suspended
for five months.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.008
- Right, I know.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.488
But I deserve it.

21:12.532 --> 21:15.578
And I learned a valuable lesson
from all this,

21:15.622 --> 21:17.580
so I'm counting it as a win.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.453
- I get that, Peralta,
but things will be a lot better

21:20.496 --> 21:22.237
when a man doesn't have
to lose his job

21:22.281 --> 21:25.109
for you to learn a lesson.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.547
- Yeah, fair enough.
Thank you, sir.

21:29.984 --> 21:31.377
It was crazy
when you got huffy.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.640
- I was so huffy.
- I got scared.

21:33.683 --> 21:34.989
- Wow.
- Yeah.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.993
<i>- Not a doctor.
- Shh.</i>
