02:24.964 --> 02:28.250
I've been thinking about what were 
you said about that concrete goal.

02:33.644 --> 02:36.805
- And?
- I think, I've known it.

02:36.905 --> 02:39.279
I'm feeling really good about this one, Al.

02:40.763 --> 02:42.469
Lay down it?

02:42.569 --> 02:45.413
- It's a girl.
- Cool! What's she like?

02:45.513 --> 02:50.927
You know, smart, beautiful, popular...
A classic TGFY.

02:51.558 --> 02:56.635
- Too Good For You, Al.
- But not for you?

02:56.735 --> 03:01.691
Well, I'm sorta outside the whole highschool
foodchain at this point, wouldn't you say?

03:06.855 --> 03:09.878
- See you gonna ask her out?
- Ask her out?

03:10.258 --> 03:12.460
No. Bad idea, no.

03:12.461 --> 03:16.073
I mean... where's the therapeutic value in that?

03:16.174 --> 03:19.390
- So, what's the plan?
- Simple.

03:19.596 --> 03:21.869
I'm gonna have fun with her.

03:21.995 --> 03:26.533
- Fun? What's that mean?
- Fun?

03:27.420 --> 03:32.192
Fun means fun. Right? 
Don't over think it, Al.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.654
It's been nice known you.

03:35.689 --> 03:40.380
- Next week?
- You know way, Al? You've made so much progress here,

03:40.415 --> 03:42.239
- I think you're ready to face the world on your own way now.
- Keith?!

03:42.274 --> 03:45.141
Don't worry, Al. You can cope.

04:03.282 --> 04:04.978
- Keep it in mind!
- Hi, Anderson! How are you?

04:05.076 --> 04:08.497
- Thanks so much. And how are you?
- I'm good, I'm just chilling.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.558
- Hi!
- Hello!

04:43.958 --> 04:46.889
- You're Rafael, are you?
- Yeah. And you're...?

04:46.890 --> 04:50.402
- Natalie... Anderson.
- Oh, a head of... everything.

04:50.403 --> 04:53.638
- I try to keep easy, yes.
- Only work, no play?

04:53.709 --> 04:55.744
None. Zero.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.765
- Are you working now?
- Oh, absolutely. It's a Key Club...

05:00.090 --> 05:03.467
We're checking on the stranger students
making sure their adjusting okay.

05:03.502 --> 05:05.841
- Oh, well what a thought...
- I can tell.

05:05.876 --> 05:09.566
- You've nearly about 50-60 new friends.
- Hey, brother.

05:09.601 --> 05:13.272
- 61.
- Yeah. It's nice to know somebody cares.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.468
- Rain...
- Yeah.

05:25.043 --> 05:27.654
- Rain...
- Natalie, come on!

05:27.655 --> 05:31.586
Alright, so I'm gonna go.
It's nice to meet you. We'll talk to later.

05:31.621 --> 05:35.512
- Comme on, let's go!
- Chao...

05:54.693 --> 05:59.055
Zach! Breakfast is on the table!

06:00.069 --> 06:04.139
- Natalie! Please get him up!
- Okay, okay!

06:10.796 --> 06:13.617
Zach! Wake up!

06:15.344 --> 06:17.772
Didn't come home!

06:18.335 --> 06:22.039
- Morning!
- Morning!

06:26.991 --> 06:30.543
Natie! Miles is a lefty, you can 
have to work with the backhand!

06:30.781 --> 06:33.752
We know, we must been the whole 
practice fill in backhand today.

06:33.753 --> 06:36.008
- According to my records last year...
- I'm over, Dead.

06:36.009 --> 06:39.588
- ...she's catched with her service. 11 aces.
- ...aces. Thanks for reminding me.

06:39.589 --> 06:43.103
- Natie is quicker now.
- If you'll being a recording job at least you'll rise 3 places.

06:43.138 --> 06:46.742
- What's this "if" about?
- Bye.

06:47.572 --> 06:50.277
- Natie, sit down have some breakfast!
- I've got Key Club this morning, Mom.

06:50.278 --> 06:52.330
You need have some protein. Sit down, please!

06:52.331 --> 06:53.885
I have a barn.

06:53.934 --> 06:56.837
- A barn is not a breakfast.
- Bye!

06:57.684 --> 07:00.266
In as for the straight subconstruction experinments...

07:00.800 --> 07:03.543
The couples are:
Hobbs and Mertin, Carlens and Stevens,

07:04.240 --> 07:08.293
Brent and Aldridge, Anderson and
Zetterstrom, Brandon and Davins...

07:29.031 --> 07:33.300
- Zetterstrom?
- I haven't lied in this far. I'm not gonna start now.

07:39.147 --> 07:41.577
You can help?

07:50.537 --> 07:54.934
- We don't need that for this.
- Look, you're not gonna be disagreable, are you?

07:54.974 --> 07:58.668
Because Walt specifically promised 
me an agreeable lab partner.

07:58.703 --> 08:01.200
- Walt?
- You need to relax.

08:01.222 --> 08:03.729
- Actually I need to learn this.
- Because why?

08:04.002 --> 08:07.880
Because you have to get a four on your AP exam
if you wanna a college credit location, didn't you know.

08:07.881 --> 08:09.390
Then you'll be ahead of the game, right?

08:09.595 --> 08:12.962
Then I can focus on that things 
where good I and keep up my GPA.

08:13.202 --> 08:16.600
Okay, so we need to fill this one with
natrium-tiosulphate and this one with nitrate...

08:16.602 --> 08:18.397
Gotta keep up that GPA.

08:18.809 --> 08:21.630
- It's kinda help if you wanna to get a job.
- A job?

08:21.730 --> 08:25.345
- Can we just do the lab?
- I'd love to! Let's do the lab!

08:25.795 --> 08:31.900
Except you're about ten years into the future.

08:33.011 --> 08:36.789
We don't need chemistry.
We need time travel.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.200
Mr. Miles, this is AP.

08:39.892 --> 08:43.537
Keith is actually pretty sharp
when he press myself.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.043
Okay...

08:45.644 --> 08:48.352
- But a bit kind of...
- Left chemistry?

08:50.561 --> 08:54.686
- Yeah.
- Try to make it work, okay?

09:00.676 --> 09:01.972
- About this Natalie Anderson...
- Yes?

09:02.505 --> 09:07.599
Walter, she's a complete anal compulsive control freak! 
How do you expect in a work with that?

09:08.287 --> 09:10.898
- But Keith, you were who...
- I'm kidding. Kidding.

09:11.938 --> 09:13.320
I would pretty shake.

09:17.008 --> 09:18.580
Who the hell do you think you are?

09:20.145 --> 09:22.500
What do you think I am?

09:40.097 --> 09:43.380
- Hey, Miss Key Club!
- Hey!

09:44.500 --> 09:48.559
- So how are your adjusting?
- Oh, wow, you'll told me how am I done?

09:48.964 --> 09:53.020
Well, you've got only one a 98 percent history
main theme so your beginmatch fall at all.

09:54.015 --> 09:59.520
- I hate people like you.
- Hey, so listen, are you gonna be at the brink again on friday?

09:59.611 --> 10:02.507
- Are you going?
- It could happen.

10:14.301 --> 10:15.836
Who's that guy?

10:16.613 --> 10:20.254
Oh... he's just my lab parner. Nobody.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.586
- See you don't remember?
- What?

10:28.621 --> 10:31.257
Well, I've sit behind you on the sixth great play

10:31.258 --> 10:34.300
when you were the princess and 
I was Russian soldier number three.

10:35.181 --> 10:37.649
- I don't remember that.
- Of course not.

10:37.684 --> 10:40.000
Princess never remembers lower people.

10:40.993 --> 10:43.451
- Excuse me, well I'll cry for you.
- You should!

10:44.190 --> 10:47.100
Should cry for me because you're 
already on the early-decision tour.

10:49.711 --> 10:52.783
It's posted in the front office.

10:52.784 --> 10:55.409
- Why are they do that?
- Why Duke?

10:57.186 --> 11:01.208
- Great faculty, division no.1, of the kind...
- I'm sure, you'll get what do you pay for.

11:01.770 --> 11:05.212
- Actually I have a partial scholarship.
- Ah, that's right.

11:05.247 --> 11:08.168
- There it goes the positive...
- Tennis.

11:09.605 --> 11:13.698
So they basically give you a punch of money
for having a ball over a net.

11:14.201 --> 11:16.533
Something like that.
Where did you apply?

11:17.293 --> 11:18.868
Nowhere.

11:20.500 --> 11:24.900
- Your're not gonna be to a college?
- Not in Judeo Christian sense. No, I am not.

11:25.431 --> 11:27.703
So, what are you doing after graduation?

11:28.543 --> 11:31.988
- The sky's the limit.
- It's simple made it.

11:34.533 --> 11:37.169
- Why are you taking in AP class...?
- I'm in packed.

11:37.269 --> 11:38.760
Then you were placed here for what?

11:43.017 --> 11:45.276
- I'm sure there's a very simple explanation.
- Of course there is Natalie

11:45.277 --> 11:47.560
and you're not can stop until you'll figured it out.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.207
That's on like a challenge. You're on.

11:53.014 --> 11:55.496
So this's all based some a little conversation.

11:55.686 --> 11:59.181
- You know, he don't gonna be ovbious can be there tonight.
- Oh, he'll definitely be there.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.966
Oh, your power positive thinking?

12:03.854 --> 12:05.400
- Hi, Brooke.
- How do you do?

12:05.500 --> 12:07.702
- Hi, Nat, can I have some brass?
- For what?

12:08.003 --> 12:10.300
- Come on, I'll pay back tomorrow.
- Get out!

12:11.707 --> 12:12.566
Let's go!

12:24.902 --> 12:26.599
- It's really cool. What happened?
- What happended with the music?

12:28.259 --> 12:30.209
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yeah.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.966
- Who's that guy?
- What's he doing?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.467
Relax, you'll like it! I promise! Listen!

12:35.666 --> 12:37.266
What do you think for you can change this?

12:38.687 --> 12:39.799
Because you'll like it. See?

12:42.233 --> 12:44.450
Just have a good time! Alright?

12:44.451 --> 12:45.756
Senorita, let's go!

12:56.218 --> 13:01.166
- What? Oh, oh, no...
- Turn away! And welcome back!

13:11.719 --> 13:15.465
- It's interesting choice of music.
- Yeah? And you bear with bob?

13:15.466 --> 13:16.444
'Course.

13:25.258 --> 13:28.965
So what do you think you gonna do after college?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.834
I'm gonna own my recordlabor.

13:31.787 --> 13:34.055
- You think big.
- Why not?

13:34.160 --> 13:36.147
What about you, Natalie?

13:38.185 --> 13:42.122
Oh, I wonder on a magazine.
I wanna be the editor.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.200
Yeah.

13:43.498 --> 13:46.753
My magazine. Why not?
Why not do something amazing?

13:46.756 --> 13:49.720
- Whole life is infront of us.
- Nobody here is look at the state.

13:49.721 --> 13:53.525
- No one wants to do anything, you know try anything new.
- Yeah.

14:06.234 --> 14:08.777
Keith.
Keith!

14:13.176 --> 14:15.480
- The lab report is due tomorrow!
- Ah, yes!

14:15.488 --> 14:19.677
But the real pressing question is
how is Rafael Marques? Your boyfriend.

14:19.712 --> 14:21.012
He is not!

14:21.013 --> 14:25.327
Great choice that Rafael!
Brainy stud! Perfect guy! Can't go wrong!

14:25.328 --> 14:27.666
- You were at the brink!
- No.

14:30.462 --> 14:31.596
But you were.

14:31.597 --> 14:35.778
- If you weren't then how would you know?
- Because that's where everyone goes.

14:37.254 --> 14:39.952
- What about the lab report?
- Hop in!

14:40.553 --> 14:43.580
- Come on! I do my best work while I'm driving.
- I have your book.

14:48.749 --> 14:53.653
By heating tin metal...
in air... at a high temperature...

14:53.753 --> 14:58.030
we were produce a tin-oxygen product 
called...

14:59.656 --> 15:00.912
Wait!

15:01.359 --> 15:06.000
So we need to convert two masses to moles and 
dividing the greater mole quantile by the lesser.

15:06.324 --> 15:11.590
Okay, so... 0,0173 tin,

15:11.690 --> 15:14.453
and 0,0350 oxygen.

15:14.488 --> 15:19.693
- So the mole ratio is?
- Mole ratio? What's that?

15:19.728 --> 15:23.222
- It's the thing you have to figure out.
- But you are already knowing the answer.

15:25.193 --> 15:27.380
Oh, come on, you're being a jerk!
I have to be back in office in fifteen minutes.

15:27.381 --> 15:32.700
What's the rush? We're here in a yellow truck,
the road ahead of us and nothing but opportunities.

15:33.053 --> 15:35.590
- Okay, what opportunities...?
- Choose a place!

15:35.591 --> 15:39.075
- Pick a place! Right now! At random!
- Okay, I choose...

15:39.076 --> 15:41.610
...the third point on our lab report
calculating the mole ratio.

15:41.645 --> 15:44.499
I can't concentrate driving in a straight 
line like this, this is not gonna work.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.175
- Then turn!
- Where?

15:46.176 --> 15:47.044
Anywhere.

15:48.981 --> 15:49.942
Wow! Very funny.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.861
The mole ratio therefore is 2:1.

15:53.862 --> 15:57.729
But now we need to find the potential 
oxidation numbers of tin and oxygen.

15:58.568 --> 15:59.800
Which are?

16:00.925 --> 16:03.200
It's time for our picnic scene.

16:07.239 --> 16:08.480
Keith!

16:11.012 --> 16:13.450
There he's! How's it going?

16:14.908 --> 16:16.379
Move along, dear!

16:20.379 --> 16:23.860
In case you haven't heard picnics
they usually take place outdoors.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.643
Oh, is that what it says 
in the official picnic rule book?

16:33.110 --> 16:34.730
This's not funny.

16:38.429 --> 16:43.985
Do you think our check is ready?
I know my pumpkin love, I'm pissed off too.

16:44.450 --> 16:47.840
Can you believe this shit? 
It's been three months since that accident.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.730
The nerve...

16:55.100 --> 16:58.455
- Take me back to school! Now!
- Yeah! Let's go back to the library

16:58.490 --> 17:01.400
and finish lab report in a safe,
acceptable way like everybody else.

17:03.472 --> 17:06.160
Bone grafts are really starting to kick me in now.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.020
Hey, Ralph!

17:22.289 --> 17:23.665
No, thanks.

17:25.192 --> 17:28.230
- You said 2:1 right for the mole ratio?
- Yeah.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.560
Duke.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.200
- Then will give you a job like a place this one day?
- God, no.

17:36.534 --> 17:41.126
- My daddy used to work in a place like this.
- Ah, yes. Daddy Anderson.

17:41.127 --> 17:46.418
An accountant? A salesman? 
A Norwegian fisherman!

17:47.042 --> 17:51.677
District manager for a phone company.
You're not very good at reading minds.

17:51.743 --> 17:54.320
Oh, that's 'cause I wasn't really trying.

18:02.079 --> 18:08.345
He manages stacks of paper. Moving them from 
side to side every day, he hates his job.

18:08.463 --> 18:12.532
When he was your age he dreamed of 
going to Duke but they rejected him.

18:12.567 --> 18:18.115
So he poured over every detail of your application,
night after night until you finally got it right.

18:18.500 --> 18:23.700
Natalie Anderson, the star of the household,
who loves being in the center of the attention.

18:24.284 --> 18:28.600
She just wished it din't mean having 
to play tennis all of the time.

18:29.003 --> 18:30.410
How am I doing on?

18:32.512 --> 18:34.190
Okay...

18:44.141 --> 18:46.000
Actually it's not so bad.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.600
Can I help you?

18:53.584 --> 18:59.300
Oh, we just... are waiting for Mr. Richardson.
He said he'd to finnish a phone call.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.733
Okay.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.490
- Goddamn that Richardson!
- Yeah...

19:08.715 --> 19:10.310
Who's he thinking of him that monkey?

19:10.496 --> 19:13.413
I'm sick of this shit! You know, tabby?
We're going straight to the top!

19:13.414 --> 19:15.820
We're getting this monkey ass FIRED!

19:18.106 --> 19:23.480
- ...allways take excuses, bullshit! We'd never payed out.
- We just have to be patient, honey!

19:24.873 --> 19:29.756
Okay, so you're an only child. 
Your Mom works for a diaryfresh. Your Dad is a...

19:29.757 --> 19:34.430
... a ordering-constructor and you live

- So have you ever been to Italy?
- Oh, yeah, I actually I stayed live there a couple of years.

38:59.467 --> 39:02.555
We're planning a trip there. It's my dream.

39:02.789 --> 39:06.567
Oh, yeah! I recommend!
Florence is one of my favourite cites.

39:07.903 --> 39:10.898
Natalie tells that your planning is to attending to Penn State.

39:11.278 --> 39:14.023
Oh, actually it's UPENN.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.522
As she told that you're quite a sportman.

39:21.523 --> 39:24.555
Oh, yeah, I've play football ever since when I was lower kid.

39:24.633 --> 39:27.600
- Oh, you know Pete was a... tell...
- No...

39:28.028 --> 39:31.660
Okay, he was a great football player at the college.

39:32.361 --> 39:34.670
I wasn't a great football player. I only played football.

39:35.196 --> 39:36.223
Oh, soccer?

39:38.199 --> 39:39.156
Football.

39:44.749 --> 39:46.212
- Bon appétit!
- Would you like an other bean?

39:55.463 --> 39:59.930
- My uncle says we can have any weekend next month.
- After 14th. After APs.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.420
- Sure.
- So your parents are give you okay for this?

40:02.830 --> 40:06.155

I need be honestly to how I feel about this.

40:17.230 --> 40:22.800
- What?
- It's beautiful. It's perfect. You're perfect.

40:24.162 --> 40:26.866
Well, I actually thought you're waiting...

40:27.914 --> 40:29.978
- But we can practice, right?
- Oh, yeah...

40:34.900 --> 40:35.655
Come in!

40:42.154 --> 40:44.520
Some guy on a truck dropped this all for you.

40:46.052 --> 40:47.320
- I'll got it!
- Okay.

40:47.321 --> 40:48.360
Thanks.

40:51.114 --> 40:54.040

- I don't know. Chem lab notes?

40:57.217 --> 41:01.013
Gosh! What is this?

41:02.102 --> 41:05.740
- Carburator tunne up kit.
- Just what I allways wanted.

41:06.992 --> 41:09.155

- He just does shit like this.
- Isn't he a little...?

41:19.680 --> 41:22.052
- Something like that.
- He's crushed on you.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.310
- He's crushed on his truck.
- Oh, whatever, just...

41:25.721 --> 41:28.312
- ...don't encourage.
- I don't!

41:28.347 --> 41:31.378
- Shit!

41:32.078 --> 41:33.927
- Actually I have to take a shower.

41:34.027 --> 41:36.334
No, that's alright. You go ahead!
I'll been there.

41:36.335 --> 41:37.050
Alright. Goodbye!

41:37.320 --> 41:37.850
- Bye!
- Bye!

41:47.076 --> 41:50.398
Keith! We need to talk.

41:50.864 --> 41:54.000
- Hop in!
- I'm not going to anywhere with you.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.657
Cool, well then I'll come inside and
watch TV with Pete and Caroline.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.648
No. No.

42:02.033 --> 42:02.834
No!

42:04.643 --> 42:08.661
- You can't just deliver shit into my house like that!
- But it works, didn't it?

42:09.602 --> 42:13.003
Listen, I like you.
I like being friends with you.

42:13.004 --> 42:15.789
But therefore we hang out from now 
I want I gotta be a part of your plans!

42:15.790 --> 42:17.445
- See, but there are no plans!
- Bullshit!

42:17.500 --> 42:19.920
- You've got some whole scenario worked out.
- Is that what you think?

42:19.921 --> 42:24.585
- Yeah, and you can't just expect me that drop 
everything because you decided you wanna do some...
- I don't expect you to do anything!

42:25.027 --> 42:27.974
You're free go at anytime! In fact,

42:27.975 --> 42:31.445
what is Nathalie Anderson doing 
hanging out a truck geek like me anyway?

42:35.424 --> 42:38.336
This is cool. This is the scene 
where we're at the crossroads.

42:39.001 --> 42:40.130
You're being a jerk.

42:40.131 --> 42:43.336
Oh, come on, miss bellequeen! 
Stud boyfriend, tennis champ!

42:44.345 --> 42:46.420
Don't you have better things to do on a Friday night?

42:47.229 --> 42:49.597
Just go, leave, get out here!

43:02.030 --> 43:05.101
You know I thought you're different,
but you're not different.

43:05.102 --> 43:09.601
You're just another immature little boy!
You're right.

43:10.357 --> 43:13.000
I'm wasting my time here.

43:21.811 --> 43:24.323
And what about you?
Mr. Egomaniac?

43:24.927 --> 43:28.200
Why are you always giving me gifts and 
writing clever little notes all of the time?

43:29.419 --> 43:31.522
Why don't you leave?

43:31.975 --> 43:34.500
- Go ahead! Drive away right now!
- There's Keith! Stop, Al!

43:37.594 --> 43:38.230
Keith!

43:38.300 --> 43:39.720
Keith, swap!

43:39.927 --> 43:44.191
They got me Super Smash Brothers and Gran Turismo 3. 
And they're beating each other up, these guys allways...

43:44.308 --> 43:46.691
- That's great, I'll to show you!
- Billy. Billy. Hi, Al.

43:46.692 --> 43:51.043
- I've got Mario and Luigi and they battling each other...
- Go on. Great. Listen, this is Sophie.

43:53.100 --> 43:54.730
- Natalie.
- Hi! I'm Al.

43:54.740 --> 43:57.848
She's a double agent. You can't trust her.

43:57.849 --> 44:02.356
- they got all these monsters that are 
battling and clashing at each other and...
- Oh, good. 'Cause I'm gonna kick your ass!

44:02.357 --> 44:05.600
I'll kick your ass!
Come on, let's get out here! Come on!

44:06.100 --> 44:08.253
- Let's go to your house!
- Billy... you know... Billy...

44:08.260 --> 44:11.189
I'm on specially assignment tonight.
How about tomorrow?

44:11.207 --> 44:13.320
- No, I got school tomorrow! Come on, let's go!
- Billy, we gotta go!

44:14.400 --> 44:17.010
- Come on, sleep one more night there! One more!
- Billy, stand out the car right now!

44:17.011 --> 44:20.036
- My parents don't care!
- Come on! Next time.

44:20.037 --> 44:21.500
- Oh, no...
- Come on.

44:23.600 --> 44:27.538
- Are we talking, Keith?
- Hang in there, Al.

44:28.388 --> 44:29.500
You're doing just fine.

44:36.093 --> 44:38.120
- I'll kick your ass!
- I'll kick your ass!

44:49.500 --> 44:53.393
- So how do you know them?
- The neighborhood.

44:55.913 --> 44:58.625
Billy is what a... hyperactive or something?

45:00.276 --> 45:05.414
So you're his counselor? 
Tutor? Something like that?

45:09.300 --> 45:10.520
Such a guy...

45:13.065 --> 45:14.999
...turns out you aren't softie.

45:25.203 --> 45:26.520
So, what is it?

45:27.173 --> 45:31.366
Church programm?
The Y? Volunteer thing?

45:35.450 --> 45:39.350
Let's get out here!
Come on, scap!

45:41.433 --> 45:45.617
We've got a yellow truck,
the road in front of us...

45:47.128 --> 45:49.700
and nothing but opportunities, right?

46:10.113 --> 46:12.100
Turn right up here! 
Right here! This dirt road!

46:13.230 --> 46:15.722
Come on! What?

46:16.111 --> 46:19.390
- Why here?
- Why?

46:20.287 --> 46:22.160
It's not supposed to be a why, right?

46:24.240 --> 46:25.400
Were you scared?

46:32.023 --> 46:36.520
- Wow! Slow down!
- Just funny! Really funny!

46:37.700 --> 46:39.950
- What?
- You chose this road.

46:48.054 --> 46:51.535
So that's the Brink! 
I've never been on this side.

46:51.983 --> 46:56.450
- I've never been on that side.
- You're not missing much.

46:57.360 --> 47:00.530
Really? I thought you're the Brink Queen.

47:01.010 --> 47:03.230
It's getting on really old.

47:03.251 --> 47:08.660
It's all about what you're wearing and who's 
hooking up with who and showing off your boyfriend.

47:08.661 --> 47:11.237
- Many essential information.
- Oh, yeah.

47:12.344 --> 47:15.268
Down there they live and die by that crap.

47:19.661 --> 47:21.400
But up here it's like...

47:22.851 --> 47:24.944
...what have I ever care.

47:32.400 --> 47:35.770
- You don't...
- What?

47:36.785 --> 47:40.445
You don't care what people think.
You're just...

47:40.883 --> 47:42.145
...you.

47:47.870 --> 47:50.940
- Whatever that is.
- It's a good thing.

47:52.849 --> 47:54.363
Really good thing.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.333
So do you come here a lot?

48:03.100 --> 48:04.688
Cool.

48:04.689 --> 48:07.440
- I found your place.
- I don't know how you did.

48:07.441 --> 48:09.490
Chances are probably one in a billion.

48:11.743 --> 48:13.686
Stranger things have happened, right?

48:33.665 --> 48:35.290
You know... we should probably leave.

48:36.626 --> 48:38.760
- Yeah.
- We're lab partners.

48:38.878 --> 48:41.021
- Yeah.
- This is strictly a lab partnership.

48:41.142 --> 48:44.654
- Absolutely.
- And Walter would be very very upset right now. So...

48:57.000 --> 48:59.350
- Hey, Raff!
- Hi, beautiful! Are you ready?

48:59.567 --> 49:02.036
I'm so sorry, I've just go ahead from a shower.

49:03.201 --> 49:06.545
Actually... I don't really feel like
to go to the brink tonight.

49:06.546 --> 49:10.190
- Why? What's wrong with the brink?
- Just that we've gone on since last six weeks in a role.

49:10.191 --> 49:12.175
I know but we've promised to Trisha,

49:12.176 --> 49:14.342
- and you know to Robbie.
- We'll see them all the time.

49:14.648 --> 49:18.345
Well, you see me all the time.
So you're sick of me all the time?

49:18.350 --> 49:21.796
Of course I'm not kidding sick of you
I'm just really be (off).

49:22.342 --> 49:25.954
Had a long day, practice after school.
I was getting to call you sooner.

49:25.989 --> 49:30.105
Okay, it's right. Just get some sleep
and we'll hang tomorrow, okay?

49:30.140 --> 49:32.745
- Yeah, see you next happening.
- Okay.

49:32.780 --> 49:35.020
- Okay, bye!
- Bye!

50:13.818 --> 50:15.090
- Hi!
- Hi!

50:15.091 --> 50:15.890
Natalie!

50:16.101 --> 50:18.620
- Guess, where can I be next year!
- Notre Dame!

50:20.995 --> 50:22.880
That's great!

50:23.832 --> 50:25.934
We have to celebrate this!

51:17.629 --> 51:21.600
- Okay, partner! Now I've got a scene.
- Shoot!

51:22.913 --> 51:24.300
It's the scene when you tell me the truth.

51:26.103 --> 51:27.690
The big confession scene.

51:29.995 --> 51:32.650
What are you doing after finish highschool?
Really.

51:35.770 --> 51:38.625
- I'm going to London.
- London?

51:39.206 --> 51:42.210
Me too! With Raff and Brooke and Travis! 
We should meet up!

51:42.211 --> 51:43.837
Not there London.

51:45.271 --> 51:49.330
London Ontario. It's a classic 
truckshow there every year in July.

51:50.009 --> 51:54.223
- So you really are truck geek.
- You see I open up to you and you dump on me.

51:54.404 --> 51:58.700
No, just because I know you have dreams
more than a truck show.

52:01.115 --> 52:04.988
- The sky's the limit, right?
- Yeah, actually it is.

52:04.989 --> 52:05.900
Are you sure?

52:09.244 --> 52:11.734
I'm sure you sell yourself short.

52:25.111 --> 52:28.530
Are we...? Are we moving?

52:31.333 --> 52:35.810
- We are moving!
- A step for moving to the space on a mission.

52:35.811 --> 52:37.200
Keith, we have a problem.

52:37.769 --> 52:41.400
- I think, there is an untreatable one in the space craft.
- Keith! Get up! Come on!

52:41.401 --> 52:44.530
- Keith, it's gonna go over! Get up!
- He's taken on the body by trusted co-pilot

52:44.531 --> 52:46.407
- called Natalie Anderson.
- Keith! It's gonna go over!

52:46.408 --> 52:48.136
- "It's gonna go over!"
- Come on! What are you doing?

52:48.137 --> 52:51.140
- Keith! Stop it!
- She's just saying: "Keith, stop it!"

52:53.400 --> 52:54.423
Keith, come on! Hurry up!

52:55.070 --> 53:00.750
- Shit! Keith!
- "Get up, Keith. Get up."

53:00.751 --> 53:04.154
Keith, come on, get up or 
you're gonna get killed! Keith!

53:04.700 --> 53:07.697
Stop it! Stop the truck! Keith!

53:13.213 --> 53:16.190
What the hell was that?
Are you crazy?!

53:16.510 --> 53:18.660
If you do shit like that,
you could get yourself killed!

53:18.661 --> 53:20.952
Don't mention what would've 
happened to my truck...

53:21.700 --> 53:23.650
Oh! Oh, yeah!

53:34.870 --> 53:36.220
It's true you wanna go over?

53:38.019 --> 53:40.010
- I wasn't even close.
- Yes, you were!

53:40.727 --> 53:43.836
- You don't know how close is.
- Don't give me one of your stupid lines!

53:44.027 --> 53:45.615
I know what close is!

53:52.206 --> 53:54.312
Good night, partner.

54:00.076 --> 54:01.640
Take care of yourself, okay?

54:44.100 --> 54:49.000
MORPHINE, INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION

56:18.574 --> 56:22.614
No, not C, Z. 
Zetterstrom.

56:24.949 --> 56:28.812
Z, E, T, T, E... 
Are you sure?

56:29.834 --> 56:33.111
- What do you think you do on?
- What?

56:34.273 --> 56:38.614
- Using yourself phone on the school property?
- Hey... don't!

56:38.615 --> 56:41.700
It was Duke, apparently there's 
a problem with my trans courts.

56:41.707 --> 56:45.769
- Oh, so everything is okay?
- Actually I have to go in the front office to deal with this.

56:46.234 --> 56:47.200
Sucks.

56:48.100 --> 56:49.100
- Bye!
- Bye!

56:50.200 --> 56:55.231
Look, he's not gone for few days now, so I was thinking 
I should call him you know get him kinda homework at all.

56:55.240 --> 56:57.350
I'm sorry, we don't get out any information.

56:58.270 --> 56:59.892
But it's kind of emergence.

56:59.893 --> 57:03.500
You know Keith is falling behind me,
it's in fact bad for me to perform the APs.

57:04.192 --> 57:06.410
You have to speak to Mr. Miles regarding that.

57:07.614 --> 57:12.100
Okay, look, he's my friend. He's gave me his number,
I'd just losted it. It's really not a big deal.

57:12.240 --> 57:15.865
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Where is he? Why isn't he come?

57:16.837 --> 57:18.770
I'm trying to learn, but he doesn't care!

57:19.145 --> 57:21.740
I think Keith's having a thought time at the moment.

57:23.830 --> 57:26.198
- Thought how?
- Thanks.

57:26.500 --> 57:30.190
- That's all I can say really.
- But... is there anything I can do?

57:30.613 --> 57:34.600
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- What?

57:36.642 --> 57:40.155
- What?
- Partner on your guys.

57:40.400 --> 57:41.800
But it was random.

57:46.560 --> 57:47.690
He chosed me?

57:49.906 --> 57:54.934
- Keith chosed me?
- I'll make sure he gets your notes.

58:29.143 --> 58:31.745
Randy Randerson's managed to set into final match.

59:04.399 --> 59:07.155
- Wanna I come in?
- Maybe. No.

59:07.500 --> 59:10.823
Shit, I don't know. I think, I just 
to get some sleep, or something.

59:12.500 --> 59:13.756
Are you puzzle with Keith?

59:15.552 --> 59:17.900
- Where that come from?
- Do you?

59:17.933 --> 59:21.591
As the matter in fact I have 
absolutely zero plans with Keith.

59:21.592 --> 59:24.185
- But you were hanging with him.
- I hang with a lot of people.

59:24.581 --> 59:26.600
Is there any wrong with that?
I'm only had to be seen with you?

59:26.601 --> 59:29.230
No, no. Relax, okay?
The match is over.

59:32.206 --> 59:34.910
Sorry. It's just a screwed day.

59:35.258 --> 59:36.465
So everything is okay?

59:36.636 --> 59:40.794
He's just my lab partner and my friend. 
Actually he's not even my friend

59:40.795 --> 59:45.580
- so can we just let it go?
- Yeah, whatever.

59:47.060 --> 59:48.690
So we'll talk to later.

01:00:07.757 --> 01:00:09.704
Natalie, we have to talk!

01:00:11.205 --> 01:00:14.560
I've lost a match.
Get over, Mom!

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.400
Natalie, come back!
Natalie, I'm talking to you!

01:01:29.943 --> 01:01:32.680
- Yeah?

01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:35.170
- Keith?
- I'm his lab partner.

01:01:35.173 --> 01:01:37.770
- May I help you?
- Are you Mr. Zetterstrom?

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:43.200
- Mr. who?
- This is the Zetterstrom house?

01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:45.769
My name is Don. Don Sope.

01:01:48.328 --> 01:01:51.794
Sorry. Wrong house.

01:02:12.745 --> 01:02:16.870
Oh, quiz! Sweet! What timing.

01:02:17.755 --> 01:02:20.340
Morning, Walt! Thank you.

01:02:33.934 --> 01:02:38.423
Hey, partner! Thanks for those notes,
I've killed that quiz.

01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:42.240
- Where have you been the last two weeks?
- Last two weeks?

01:02:42.851 --> 01:02:46.600
- What, do you come here every day?
- There's some wrong with you, isn't there?

01:02:46.601 --> 01:02:52.053
Yeah, yeah there is, with me,
definitely with you,

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.943
- with this sexy little freshman right here.
- I don't wanna be funny anymore, Keith.

01:02:56.616 --> 01:02:59.700
Oh, well I hate to break it to you, Anderson
but you've never really been funny to begin, right?

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:02.490
What are you? Depressed or something?

01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:05.246
Depressed? Yes, throw that out there.
Chicks find it incredibly sexy.

01:03:05.247 --> 01:03:07.010
- I'm being serious, Keith.
- Why?

01:03:07.813 --> 01:03:09.266
It never works.

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.020
You could have to told me.

01:03:14.113 --> 01:03:15.500
Could I told you what?

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:21.511
- That... you have problems...
- You don't know the half of them.

01:03:25.026 --> 01:03:27.140
- Hey, Raff.
- What's going on?

01:03:27.141 --> 01:03:27.945
What?

01:03:28.348 --> 01:03:32.390
- The jacket...
- Are you like it? I got it from K-Mart.

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:34.604
Raff, I was cold he lent it to me.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:39.486
Oh, come on, you don't expect 
him to believe that, do you?

01:03:39.777 --> 01:03:43.300
See Raff, we're part of this jacket smuggling ring,

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:46.830
but if you're quiet enough I swear 
there's a fleece in it somewhere for you.

01:03:46.831 --> 01:03:48.950
- Look, I'm not talking to you, okay?
- Hey, man, don't get mad at me.

01:03:48.952 --> 01:03:52.370
- I only a supply dishing, okay? I don't create the demand...
- Shut the hell up!

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:55.646
Raff! Raff, it's just a jacket.
That's it! It's a jacket.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.650
This is bullshit!

01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:02.500
Raff, wait up!

01:04:05.182 --> 01:04:06.500
Marques, it was a joke!

01:04:07.698 --> 01:04:10.435
Raff! Raff!

01:04:11.396 --> 01:04:13.515
- Was just a jacket, right?
- Yes!

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:15.684
- That's it?
- Of course, that's all it was!

01:04:16.282 --> 01:04:17.100
Raff, come on...

01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:20.370
I've class.

01:04:24.921 --> 01:04:27.312
- So all was just a big joke to you, huh?
- I don't know.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.150
- How is it?
- I don't know. I don't know anything anymore.

01:04:30.155 --> 01:04:31.620
Why did you choose me your lab partner?

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.100
- Me?
- Don't bullshit me! Miles told me!

01:04:35.101 --> 01:04:37.800
Walter Miles is CIA, you can't trust him.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.430
- Where do you live?
- What?

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.344
Where do you live? 
You've lied about it!

01:04:41.373 --> 01:04:43.830
- Are you losing it partner?
- You lied about everything!

01:04:43.832 --> 01:04:48.121
'Cause you know what, I've got some great pills that
you can take. But I'm sure you already knew that.

01:05:43.261 --> 01:05:46.660
I just don't understand,
Natalie was one of the school's finest students.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:51.324
- I needed the chemistry notes.
- You know very well that's not the way to get them.

01:05:51.325 --> 01:05:54.412
- She made a mistake.
- She's been under a lot of pressure lately with

01:05:54.413 --> 01:05:56.457
the tennis, the schedule and the homework...

01:05:56.458 --> 01:06:00.300
I'm sorry but the faithing's school 
properties are remarked one week suspension.

01:06:00.952 --> 01:06:03.000
- What? What was just to suppose to do...?
- Natalie.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.045
- I can make any exceptions to therefore.
- I needed the notes I have to take my AP!

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:11.045
Mr. Miles make sure you get thoes notes.

01:06:22.654 --> 01:06:24.890
Just don't make a mass of those things 
what there you worked so hard!

01:06:24.893 --> 01:06:26.143
Please, can we leave just not?

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:29.399
- You don't wanna something to tell us?
- Stop the car!

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.191
What?

01:06:30.192 --> 01:06:34.050
- I can't thinking here. I wanna get out!
- You're staying right where you are, missy!

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.186

01:06:44.127 --> 01:06:46.144

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:37.900

- It has nothing to do with you.
- 'Cause of it's about to do with Keith?

01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:42.023
- It's about me.

Idiot!

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.055
Hi!

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.654

Thanks anyway.

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.488
I don't...

01:12:07.454 --> 01:12:10.800
I don't care where you're gonna be next year.

01:12:11.983 --> 01:12:14.070
I don't care if you're crazy.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.965
God...

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.400
I just know I wanna to be with you.

01:12:25.765 --> 01:12:28.032
I don't understand what you're doing.

01:12:34.773 --> 01:12:38.273
It seems so pointless,
I mean everything,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.375
it just seems so pointless!
But when I'm with you, it's different,

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:49.430
I don't know why.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.121
So we should actually go bowling.

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.898
- You know like with lanes and pins.
- Yeah, we should.

01:14:03.444 --> 01:14:05.100
- Maybe tomorrow?
- Maybe.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.300
- Are you even gonna be in school tomorrow?
- I don't know.

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.909
- I don't know about any this actually.
- What?

01:14:14.186 --> 01:14:17.258
I mean a guy like me with a truck

01:14:17.259 --> 01:14:19.000
gotta keep moving.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.240
Stop it.

01:14:20.241 --> 01:14:22.800
I mean, you know, I'm not really feel
the hold touch thing anyway.

01:14:22.802 --> 01:14:25.220
- Shut up!
- You got Raff.

01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:30.270
Raff's good guy. Good for you.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.250
We should just forget about it.

01:14:44.388 --> 01:14:47.999
- Fuck you!
- You just did partner.

01:15:27.783 --> 01:15:30.300
If you just fault to fit matches 
what do you expect?

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.541
You're weighting grabb 15 points last month.

01:15:34.112 --> 01:15:35.122
Great.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.015
That's just perfect.

01:15:37.016 --> 01:15:40.950
I would talk to Mr. Richard Honings,
he's a big guy of the DTTA.

01:15:40.977 --> 01:15:45.445
No, all we need to do ask for an excuse to a doctor
to write a letter saying you were injured.

01:15:46.213 --> 01:15:50.500
- But I wasn't injured.
- This is a 10,000 dollars scholarship we are talking about.

01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:53.750
It's not my fault you wanna me to go 
the most expensive school in universe.

01:15:53.752 --> 01:15:56.365
- Duke is the best you've ever...
- Why would you sold yourself short?

01:15:56.431 --> 01:15:58.269
I needn't finnishing in the other applications.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.987
- Honey, you didn't have to.
- You didn't want me to.

01:16:01.192 --> 01:16:04.378
There are billion other schools
and than or I could get a job

01:16:04.538 --> 01:16:07.614
- or something.
- You don't have to a comromise, honey

01:16:07.615 --> 01:16:10.111
if we focus on this week the scholarship'll be back.

01:16:10.314 --> 01:16:11.430
Maybe I don't wanna give it back.

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.828
Maybe I don't wanna play tennis 
for six hours a day at the college.

01:16:16.754 --> 01:16:21.026
Maybe I'm sick of it after 10 stupid years!
Thouht I ever cared of you?

01:16:21.526 --> 01:16:25.460
Honey! There's no reason to give up on your dream now!

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:29.888
- Oh, are you even listening to me?
- It is almost june! It is too late!

01:16:31.276 --> 01:16:34.504

Actually I haven't seen him much.

01:17:33.375 --> 01:17:36.276

01:17:36.754 --> 01:17:38.323

I really like you.

01:19:16.873 --> 01:19:20.200

- I'm just screwed a lot of things suffering now.

01:19:20.201 --> 01:19:22.277

I wasn't bulling you off!
Okey, things got complicated.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:38.297
- You've started bullshitting me, Natalie!
- You wanted to know what really happened?

01:19:38.397 --> 01:19:41.910
I know what happened, okay? 
You let down that little yuck screwed your head!

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.023
- Is that what do you think?
- Yes. It's obvious!

01:19:47.174 --> 01:19:50.600
- You've no idea what are you talking about.
- But I would known when you told me!

01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:51.880
- Stop it!
- What were you thinking?

01:19:51.881 --> 01:19:55.180
What the hell were you thinking?!
... you giving up yourself to a piece of shit?

01:19:55.181 --> 01:19:55.900
Stop it!

01:20:01.591 --> 01:20:03.840
You know I only hope good things for you.

01:20:04.497 --> 01:20:09.555
'Cause really bad shit happens people!
I hope the God it never happens to you!

01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:35.464
Welcome back, bad girl!

01:20:38.347 --> 01:20:42.452
Alright ladies, gentleman! 
Please leave your final reports on my desk...

01:20:42.487 --> 01:20:45.606
and I want to make sure your glassworhts are cleaned,
your beakers and your testcubes aren't dirty.

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:49.670
If these aren't clean, you must clean them 
or you'll lose points.

01:20:49.672 --> 01:20:52.520
If anything is missing, please gonna sign me immediately.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:57.728
Finally you make sure that your labdesks are cleaned...

01:21:11.252 --> 01:21:13.730
Four test cubes, three beakers...

01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:18.600
and a Bunsen burner.

01:21:21.346 --> 01:21:25.530
Yeah, okay, everything seems to be in order. Keys?

01:21:29.378 --> 01:21:30.506
Natalie, key?

01:21:35.042 --> 01:21:37.189
The end of chemistry as we know it.

01:21:38.191 --> 01:21:40.730
You're such a goddamn glib little actor!

01:21:41.626 --> 01:21:43.840
As far as I'm concerned this is 
a really chickenshit goodbye!

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.132
Excuse me.

01:21:49.285 --> 01:21:52.787
Don't worry, Walter.
She was adressing her remarks to me.

01:22:29.192 --> 01:22:34.900
Hey! That truck-guy's here.
Said something about going out bowling.

01:22:41.449 --> 01:22:44.878
- Okay.
- I've got.

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:25.830
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Everybody bites it sooner or later.

01:23:26.637 --> 01:23:30.395
I'm just in the AP class, ahead of the game.

01:23:31.783 --> 01:23:35.310
- Always the joke.
- Al says it's a phase, it'll stop soon.

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:38.488
But, hey! At least it wasn't all 
about the sympathy for the sick kid.

01:23:40.272 --> 01:23:41.423
That's not fair!

01:23:44.734 --> 01:23:47.831
Is Duke fair?
Is Europe fair?

01:23:48.466 --> 01:23:52.270
At this rate I won't even make it
to London, Ontario. Is that fair?

01:23:53.666 --> 01:23:54.636
Bowling.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.794
That's what I get.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.222
Bowling.

01:24:16.617 --> 01:24:19.520
- We're not going bowling.
- Why?

01:24:20.259 --> 01:24:23.188
We're saving now.
Turn left!

01:24:53.998 --> 01:24:57.336
- So where are we going on?
- The sky's the limit.

01:24:57.637 --> 01:24:59.970
I've never lied in this far.
I'm not gonna start now.

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.787
What are we doing? Really?

01:25:13.444 --> 01:25:17.171
- This is the goodbye-scene.
- Let's not... Okay?

01:25:17.206 --> 01:25:19.665
Come on, Zetterstrom!
You can do it!

01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:27.907
Okay. Wake up! Natalie!

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:33.384
Don't you see what happened you?
You had a beautiful life,

01:25:33.985 --> 01:25:38.312
and I had shit.
I hated your guts.

01:25:38.451 --> 01:25:44.344
I wanted to take you down, I wanted to make you
as miserable as I am and that's exactly what I did!

01:25:45.214 --> 01:25:48.910
Now, how's that for a goodbye?

01:25:51.055 --> 01:25:55.265
- Pretty lame.
- Face it, Anderson! I screwed you.

01:25:57.888 --> 01:25:59.800
I screwed you big time.

01:26:02.313 --> 01:26:05.752
So you screwed me. So what?

01:26:07.404 --> 01:26:11.370
Me? 
I made love to you.

01:26:16.537 --> 01:26:19.696
Try again.
Try again!

01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:40.577
I had it all figured out.
So I cut out a little early, who cares?

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.970
It's probably a good thing.
Life sucks, anyway.

01:26:46.275 --> 01:26:48.910
But then I met you and it got weird.

01:26:52.497 --> 01:26:57.669
And you were so... amazing.

01:27:00.031 --> 01:27:03.154
- And I...
- What?

01:27:04.573 --> 01:27:05.730
What?

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.543
I just wanted a little more time.

01:27:14.435 --> 01:27:19.510
So all in all, I'd say you're the 
worst thing that's ever happened to me.

01:27:21.431 --> 01:27:22.770
Goodbye partner.

01:27:40.205 --> 01:27:42.359
I'm staying with you until you leave.

01:27:42.866 --> 01:27:47.845
I don't care how much time we have!
Give up you stupid jerk?

01:29:06.122 --> 01:29:07.720
I'm starting it up.

01:29:15.125 --> 01:29:19.715
Now turn into the left till the get its place! 
Then back a little bit.

01:29:23.379 --> 01:29:24.233
Okay.

01:29:27.259 --> 01:29:30.960
Perfect. It'll good for 50,000 miles.

01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:56.000
