00:19.447 --> 00:21.682
Okay. How in the world
did you manage

00:21.781 --> 00:22.881
to convince me
to do this?

00:22.948 --> 00:24.048
'Cause it's your
60th birthday.

00:24.116 --> 00:25.483
Uh-huh.

00:25.551 --> 00:27.318
And I'm Daddy's little girl.

00:27.386 --> 00:30.088
I love you, too, sweetie.

00:31.290 --> 00:32.924
I'll see you on the other side.

00:32.975 --> 00:34.392
Yeah.
One.

00:34.460 --> 00:35.960
Two.

00:36.028 --> 00:38.062
Three!

00:39.465 --> 00:41.566
Hello?

00:41.634 --> 00:42.767
Hello, Judge Kamalei.

00:42.818 --> 00:44.152
Yes. Who's this?

00:44.236 --> 00:47.355
Your daughter's quite
the adventurer, isn't she?

00:49.575 --> 00:50.975
Where... Who-who are you?

00:51.026 --> 00:54.612
Tell me, Your Honor, what was
the last thing you said to her

00:54.680 --> 00:57.682
before she left the platform?

00:57.750 --> 00:58.817
Who the hell is this?

00:59.869 --> 01:02.370
I hope you said good-bye.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.790
Katie!

01:07.426 --> 01:08.660
Katie!

01:42.077 --> 01:43.828
You ready to go see
Uncle Matty or what?

01:43.830 --> 01:44.947
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:44.998 --> 01:46.448
He's the coolest ever.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.450
- He's what?
- The coolest ever.

01:48.518 --> 01:50.786
Coolest ever?

01:50.837 --> 01:53.172
You know, a less secure father
might take that personally.

01:53.256 --> 01:54.840
I always considered myself
to be

01:54.925 --> 01:56.709
the coolest ever.

01:57.994 --> 02:01.931
No? Okay, I guess
I'm not. Go ahead.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.132
Come in!

02:10.774 --> 02:12.641
Uncle Matt?

02:14.144 --> 02:16.011
Who's the greatest uncle
in the whole wide world?

02:16.062 --> 02:18.147
Uncle Matt!

02:22.152 --> 02:23.068
Is this for me?

02:23.153 --> 02:24.486
No. This is
for your dad.

02:24.554 --> 02:27.289
Hurricane Matty
strikes again. Huh?

02:27.357 --> 02:29.291
Hey. What'd I tell
you about spoiling her?

02:29.359 --> 02:30.659
I am not spoiling her.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.044
You're not?
No.

02:33.897 --> 02:35.130
Okay. A little bit.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.900
Come here, I love you.
Been too long, huh?

02:37.968 --> 02:39.535
Hasn't been that long.

02:39.603 --> 02:40.869
No, it actually has.

02:40.921 --> 02:42.538
My going-away party
was a year ago.

02:42.606 --> 02:44.139
No, you have not been
out here for a year.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.307
I know, it feels like ten.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.142
I can't believe
that you came

02:47.210 --> 02:49.979
all the way to Hawaii.
Yeah. Well...

02:50.046 --> 02:51.881
She's worth it.

02:51.948 --> 02:53.249
How's things with Rachel?

02:53.316 --> 02:55.351
They are, uh...

02:55.402 --> 02:56.902
they're getting better.

02:56.987 --> 03:00.656
We actually have conversations,
and I don't feel like

03:00.723 --> 03:03.125
a blood vessel's gonna explode
out of my neck, so that's good.

03:03.193 --> 03:04.493
- Good. Progress.
- Yeah, absolutely.

03:04.561 --> 03:07.830
So? Why the, uh,
why the sudden visit?

03:07.898 --> 03:09.331
You're on business,
right?

03:09.399 --> 03:12.001
What do you mean? What, a guy
can't drop in on his bro?

03:12.068 --> 03:14.670
No. A guy can drop in on
his bro, but not you, okay?

03:14.737 --> 03:16.438
'Cause last time
you dropped in on me,

03:16.506 --> 03:18.407
you crashed Dad's car
into a tree.

03:18.475 --> 03:21.043
Let the IROC go, Danny.
Okay? I came here to have fun.

03:21.094 --> 03:22.745
Proof. Right here.

03:22.812 --> 03:24.747
We are going to swim
with dolphins,

03:24.814 --> 03:26.081
we are going to feed sharks,

03:26.149 --> 03:27.266
hot air ballooning.

03:27.350 --> 03:28.918
This place
has everything.

03:28.985 --> 03:30.586
Yeah, they
got everything.

03:30.654 --> 03:31.754
I mean,
they got tsunamis,

03:31.821 --> 03:33.589
they got giant centipedes...

03:33.657 --> 03:35.557
You know what your
problem is? Your issue?

03:35.625 --> 03:37.459
Lack of adventurous spirit.

03:37.527 --> 03:39.111
You're a spoilsport!
Am I right, Gracie?

03:39.195 --> 03:40.429
Yeah.

03:42.315 --> 03:44.333
Hold on a second.

03:47.704 --> 03:50.706
When? Okay.

03:51.491 --> 03:52.942
Guys, I got bad news.

03:53.009 --> 03:55.611
I gotta go to work. Grace, gotta
take you back to Mom, okay?

03:55.679 --> 03:57.796
Wait a second.
She can hang with me.

03:57.881 --> 03:59.348
- You're gonna babysit?
- Yeah.

03:59.416 --> 04:01.750
We can hang out for the day, and
then we'll meet you for dinner.

04:01.801 --> 04:02.918
What do you think, Gracie?
Mm-hmm.

04:02.969 --> 04:05.287
All right. But listen,
no funny stuff.

04:05.338 --> 04:06.488
No trouble, okay?
I won't.

04:06.556 --> 04:08.991
I know <i>you</i> won't.
I'm talking to him.

04:09.059 --> 04:11.060
All right.
Come on.

04:11.127 --> 04:14.296
I'll see you guys later.
Stay out of trouble.

04:14.347 --> 04:16.098
We need to cause trouble,

04:16.149 --> 04:17.933
right now. Yes.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.267
I heard that.

04:25.025 --> 04:26.975
Chin.

04:27.027 --> 04:29.411
Hey, listen, I think we need
to expand the grid search

04:29.479 --> 04:30.746
to a half-mile radius.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.748
What did you find?

04:32.815 --> 04:34.917
The end of the zip line here,
it's all charred,

04:34.984 --> 04:38.671
and there's a, uh... a residue,
a film, all over it.

04:38.755 --> 04:40.005
You think it was an explosive?

04:40.090 --> 04:41.523
Yeah, I do.

04:41.591 --> 04:43.459
Could've been a shape charge
that went high order.

04:43.510 --> 04:46.261
I also found evidence
of an electronic trigger.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.163
Probably short-wave.

04:48.231 --> 04:49.665
Somebody blew
the zip line out, Chin,

04:49.733 --> 04:51.934
and they had to have been
close by to do it.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.702
Okay. I'll see what I can find.

05:06.202 --> 05:07.536
<i>We know this is hard, but...</i>

05:07.573 --> 05:09.841
can you tell us
about the phone call?

05:10.579 --> 05:13.097
It was an unknown number.

05:13.181 --> 05:14.432
He had a thin,

05:14.516 --> 05:17.017
raspy voice.

05:17.085 --> 05:20.187
Didn't recognize it.

05:20.255 --> 05:22.606
He knew I was a judge.

05:22.691 --> 05:25.392
He called me "Your Honor."

05:25.460 --> 05:29.263
I think
he was watching us.

05:29.331 --> 05:32.466
One minute Katie
was waving good-bye...

05:32.534 --> 05:34.869
then the next...

05:36.538 --> 05:38.155
I'm sorry.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.407
You've got to excuse me.

05:44.546 --> 05:46.280
Single father, one kid.

05:46.348 --> 05:50.217
Yeah. He just lost
the only family he had.

05:50.285 --> 05:53.287
Do you think the daughter
was a target, or just...

05:53.355 --> 05:55.623
collateral damage?
No, I think from the phone call

05:55.690 --> 05:57.124
the father was definitely
the target.

05:57.175 --> 05:59.560
The killer was
taunting him.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.296
He knew his name, his number,
exactly where he'd be.

06:02.364 --> 06:04.098
Definitely premeditated. Yeah.

06:04.166 --> 06:08.152
I want a full protective detail
on the judge, 24/7.

06:08.236 --> 06:10.738
For all we know,
this whack job's not done.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.987
So I found these tire tracks

06:27.055 --> 06:29.857
in an area that's usually
off limits to vehicles.

06:29.925 --> 06:32.626
They're recent, and they're well
within sight of the platform.

06:32.694 --> 06:34.428
You get a hit from the HPD database?
Yeah.

06:34.496 --> 06:36.830
According to the size, depth,

06:36.882 --> 06:38.465
and tread pattern,
it looks like our suspect

06:38.533 --> 06:40.393
was driving a late-model SUV
or a light pickup.

06:40.528 --> 06:42.048
Once we get a suspect,
we can pull a match.

06:42.073 --> 06:42.973
Okay, Danny.

06:43.056 --> 06:45.391
Any luck tracing
the phone call to the judge?

06:46.007 --> 06:47.308
No, the phone's a burner.
Completely untraceable.

06:47.375 --> 06:49.360
But, uh,
the HPD bomb squad

06:49.444 --> 06:51.678
they checked out
the fragments that you found,

06:51.730 --> 06:53.347
and they said
it's from an RF receiver

06:53.398 --> 06:56.116
usually found in walkie-talkies
or remote-controlled cars.

06:56.184 --> 06:57.818
They're doing chemical analysis
on the explosives right now.

06:57.869 --> 06:59.386
Kono, what do you got?

06:59.454 --> 07:01.856
I've been trying to get a hold
of the judge's threat file,

07:01.923 --> 07:03.707
but the deputy prosecutor's
been in court all day.

07:03.792 --> 07:05.659
- Threat file?
- The prosecutor's office

07:05.710 --> 07:07.995
has a team of investigators
whose sole job is to keep track

07:08.063 --> 07:09.730
of any written or verbal threats
against the bench.

07:09.798 --> 07:11.632
Basically, just weed out
the whack jobs, right?

07:11.700 --> 07:13.534
So depending on how heavy
the threat,

07:13.602 --> 07:16.053
they either do or do not
pass it on to the Feds.

07:16.137 --> 07:17.922
So what we're looking for
right now is someone

07:18.006 --> 07:19.406
who matches
our killer's profile so far:

07:19.474 --> 07:22.910
male, violent, history with
explosives, and an axe to grind.

07:22.978 --> 07:24.245
Makes sense.
With cops, judges,

07:24.312 --> 07:25.846
anyone who puts away
hardened criminals,

07:25.897 --> 07:27.314
suspect pool's going
to be pretty deep.

07:27.382 --> 07:29.783
Okay, so if we're focusing
on violent felony cases

07:29.851 --> 07:31.902
the judge has presided over,
how deep is this pool

07:31.987 --> 07:33.687
that we're
talking about?

07:37.409 --> 07:39.777
Okay. Uh, we need
to whittle this down.

07:39.861 --> 07:41.662
In the meantime,
let's make sure Judge Kamalei's

07:41.729 --> 07:43.097
personal security detail
has a picture

07:43.164 --> 07:44.865
of every one of these guys.

07:44.933 --> 07:48.168
<i>When this killer</i>
<i>comes back for the judge,</i>

07:48.236 --> 07:49.937
<i>we're going to be ready.</i>

07:58.731 --> 07:59.848
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:59.939 --> 08:01.957
All right.
Thanks, Chin.

08:02.034 --> 08:04.319
HPD is in place.
The judge is secure.

08:04.386 --> 08:07.021
Kono and I are going to go
see Deputy Prosecutor Chen

08:07.089 --> 08:09.023
tomorrow, try to narrow
down our suspects.

08:09.091 --> 08:10.692
We'll take all the help
we can get.

08:10.759 --> 08:12.861
You know, I really appreciate
this escort through the Hilton.

08:12.928 --> 08:14.596
I'm just stopping in
to pick up Grace.

08:14.663 --> 08:15.997
It's no big deal.

08:16.065 --> 08:17.999
Besides, I want
to meet your brother.

08:18.067 --> 08:19.934
Well, be warned.

08:20.002 --> 08:22.003
Mr. Wall Street has
quite a personality.

08:22.071 --> 08:23.504
Runs in the
family, huh?

08:23.556 --> 08:26.140
Disorder. Personality
dis... order.

08:35.049 --> 08:37.684
Hey, Rach.
What are you doing here?

08:37.753 --> 08:39.821
Mmm, it's nice
to see you, too, Daniel.

08:39.871 --> 08:42.188
I invited her. Come on,
it's been a long time

08:42.241 --> 08:43.991
since we've had
a family meal.

08:44.058 --> 08:45.543
It'll be just
like old times.

08:45.628 --> 08:47.662
Steven.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.531
My brother Matthew. Matthew...
Good to meet you.

08:49.598 --> 08:50.365
Great to meet you.

08:50.432 --> 08:52.550
Well, can you stay awhile?

08:52.635 --> 08:54.736
Uh... no Stan?

08:54.803 --> 08:57.038
Well, he's in Boston
on business.

08:57.106 --> 08:58.039
Again?

08:58.107 --> 08:59.774
Daniel.
What?

08:59.842 --> 09:01.643
Hey, so, uh, listen,
I'll leave you to it.

09:01.710 --> 09:03.745
You stay, Danny.
Come on, come on. Steve.

09:03.812 --> 09:06.214
Even cops can spare a half hour
to grab some food, come on.

09:06.282 --> 09:07.932
Come on, hang out,
I got Danny's favorite.

09:08.017 --> 09:09.267
I got surf and turf. Yeah.

09:09.351 --> 09:11.569
What do you think?

09:11.654 --> 09:12.820
I could eat.
Surf? Or, uh...

09:12.888 --> 09:13.938
I could eat surf.

09:14.023 --> 09:15.089
Surf? Okay.
Come on.

09:15.157 --> 09:17.559
Can I...? Thank you.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.373
I'm telling you
something.

09:32.441 --> 09:35.343
He would do it
every, every time.

09:35.411 --> 09:36.678
Every time.
No, he didn't.

09:36.745 --> 09:38.880
He did not!
Not every time.

09:38.931 --> 09:41.883
Okay, Danny, tell them
about the time at the zoo.

09:41.951 --> 09:43.151
Again with the...
Every time with the zoo.

09:43.218 --> 09:45.303
Okay? You were...
He was causing a disturbance.

09:45.387 --> 09:47.889
You handcuffed me to

09:47.940 --> 09:49.223
the monkey cages.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.309
Hey, I... I was
doing my job.

09:51.393 --> 09:53.427
Danny, you were nine!
What are you talking about?

09:53.479 --> 09:54.979
They were plastic handcuffs.
Just so you know.

09:55.064 --> 09:57.799
So you were a
cop back then?

09:57.866 --> 09:59.334
Oh, yeah. My parents
would say, you know,

09:59.401 --> 10:02.403
"Where's, uh, where's your
brother?" Danny would say,

10:02.471 --> 10:04.122
"Guess we lost him."

10:04.206 --> 10:06.407
You are horrible, Daniel.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.509
Oh, I always
would come back for you.

10:08.577 --> 10:10.161
Didn't I?
You know what, take my hand.

10:10.245 --> 10:11.496
Didn't I, huh?
That is true. That is true.

10:11.580 --> 10:12.947
If you remembered
where you left me.

10:13.015 --> 10:14.515
I love you.

10:16.552 --> 10:18.720
Look at this... look at
this little cutie-patootie.

10:18.787 --> 10:20.287
Oh, my gosh.

10:20.339 --> 10:21.789
I know, she is so tired.

10:24.526 --> 10:26.694
She drank several,
several sodas.

10:28.463 --> 10:30.565
Hey.

10:30.633 --> 10:33.935
See these two guys
over Rachel's right shoulder?

10:34.003 --> 10:35.670
Goofy aloha shirt
and cheap shoes?

10:35.738 --> 10:37.171
Yeah.

10:37.239 --> 10:39.240
Look like Feds, huh?
Mm-hmm.

10:39.308 --> 10:40.975
They watching us?
I don't know.

10:41.026 --> 10:44.312
Guy on the right walked
out of my brother's room

10:44.380 --> 10:45.780
in a waiter outfit
earlier today.

10:45.848 --> 10:48.182
Really?
Yeah.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.251
Looks like they're
getting up.

10:50.319 --> 10:51.486
What do you want to do?

10:51.553 --> 10:53.087
Say hello?
I think we should say hello.

10:53.155 --> 10:54.589
Hey, uh, we'll
be right back.

10:54.657 --> 10:57.125
All right.
One second.

10:57.176 --> 10:58.726
Okay.

11:06.101 --> 11:08.670
Hey.

11:10.222 --> 11:11.856
Gentlemen.
Special Agent Edward Kipton.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.875
this is Special Agent
Adam Markowitz.

11:13.942 --> 11:14.942
FBI. We know.

11:15.010 --> 11:16.544
What do you want
with my brother?

11:16.612 --> 11:19.347
I'm sorry.
It's an active investigation.

11:19.415 --> 11:21.199
You know how it is.
Oh, okay.

11:21.283 --> 11:24.419
Um, listen, we have, on this
Island, what is called...

11:24.486 --> 11:25.787
What does the government
call it?

11:25.854 --> 11:27.354
It's called full immunity
and means.

11:27.406 --> 11:29.190
Full immunity and means.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.958
So...
I'll give her a call.

11:31.026 --> 11:32.627
Just do yourself a favor,
okay, and just tell me

11:32.695 --> 11:35.129
why you're following my brother.
We don't have to do all this.

11:35.197 --> 11:36.297
Governor Jameson please.

11:36.365 --> 11:38.166
Right, you have the
governor on speed dial?

11:38.233 --> 11:39.734
Exactly.
Hello, Governor.

11:39.802 --> 11:42.870
Yes, ma'am. No, I'm standing
with a couple of FBI agents here

11:42.921 --> 11:46.207
who are refusing to share
information about a case.

11:46.275 --> 11:47.275
Why are you smiling?
He's not kidding.

11:47.342 --> 11:48.443
He did this to me.

11:48.510 --> 11:51.479
No. Yes, ma'am.
No, we tried. Mm-hmm.

11:51.547 --> 11:53.648
Yes, ma'am.

11:53.716 --> 11:55.550
It's for you.
Okay.

11:55.617 --> 11:57.552
Who is this?

11:58.353 --> 11:59.654
Yeah, right. It's good.

11:59.722 --> 12:02.073
My name? Kipton.
Edward Kipton.

12:05.260 --> 12:06.694
Um...

12:06.762 --> 12:08.563
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.367
I'm terribly sorry. Of course.

12:13.419 --> 12:14.602
Of course.

12:17.589 --> 12:20.775
Now, answer the man's question.

12:23.095 --> 12:25.713
Matthew Williams is the focus
of a federal investigation.

12:25.781 --> 12:28.716
He's being accused
of defrauding his investors

12:28.784 --> 12:30.718
out of millions of dollars.
Whoa. Defrauding?

12:30.769 --> 12:32.253
No, no, no,
that's impossible.

12:32.321 --> 12:33.888
Not according
to the SEC

12:33.939 --> 12:35.923
and the dozen
forensic accountants

12:35.991 --> 12:37.191
they have going
through his books.

12:37.259 --> 12:38.960
Okay, well, you and you
and the SEC

12:39.027 --> 12:40.728
are all wrong, okay?

12:40.779 --> 12:42.063
My brother runs a hedge fund.

12:42.131 --> 12:43.698
And contrary to the
talking heads on television,

12:43.766 --> 12:45.600
that does not make him a thief,
you understand?

12:45.667 --> 12:47.135
We're not here to argue.

12:47.202 --> 12:48.569
Our job is to make sure

12:48.637 --> 12:50.271
that your brother doesn't take
his vacation overseas

12:50.339 --> 12:51.606
before the indictment
comes down.

12:51.673 --> 12:53.474
So...
Indictment?

12:53.542 --> 12:54.642
...if you hear anything

12:54.710 --> 12:55.943
about his travel plans,
I'd appreciate it

12:56.011 --> 12:57.945
if you'd give us a call, okay?
And, Danny,

12:58.013 --> 12:59.614
if you say anything
to your brother,

12:59.681 --> 13:00.748
we will prosecute you

13:00.816 --> 13:03.251
for obstruction.
I'm sure you will.

13:04.136 --> 13:05.620
See if your fairy godmother

13:05.687 --> 13:07.088
can get you out of that.

13:22.855 --> 13:25.990
Listen to me.
I know my kid brother, okay.

13:26.074 --> 13:29.827
He's a lot of things,
but he is not a criminal.

13:29.912 --> 13:32.280
Okay, okay.

13:34.016 --> 13:35.349
Maybe he was set up.

13:35.417 --> 13:37.251
Yeah, maybe.

13:37.319 --> 13:39.170
Listen to me, all right,

13:39.254 --> 13:41.289
let me tell you something
about my brother, okay?

13:41.340 --> 13:43.257
When Rachel and I split up,
all right,

13:43.325 --> 13:45.626
I took a room at a motel
right down the block,

13:45.694 --> 13:47.378
because I wanted to be close
to Grace.

13:47.462 --> 13:48.596
This two-star dump.

13:48.664 --> 13:50.631
My brother--
every single night,

13:50.699 --> 13:52.767
he would come over
with a six-pack of beer

13:52.834 --> 13:54.501
and all the time in the world.

13:54.553 --> 13:55.836
Never once, not one time,

13:55.888 --> 13:58.005
did I catch him looking
at his watch, okay?

13:58.073 --> 14:00.107
He just sat there
talk to me every single night.

14:00.175 --> 14:01.943
He'd fall asleep
sitting up in a chair.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.861
Wake up the next morning,
go straight to work.

14:03.946 --> 14:05.780
Every day, okay,
for six months he did this.

14:05.847 --> 14:08.316
For six months he talked me
off the ledge, all right?

14:08.383 --> 14:10.751
I'm telling you, I would not
have gotten through that

14:10.819 --> 14:12.203
if it wasn't for him, okay?

14:12.287 --> 14:13.821
He didn't do this.

14:13.889 --> 14:16.057
Okay. All right, fine.

14:16.124 --> 14:17.491
You... you got to talk to him.

14:17.543 --> 14:21.212
Yeah. I just don't think that
this is a one-time conversation.

14:21.296 --> 14:22.797
That's fine.

14:22.864 --> 14:25.066
Listen, you talk to him,
take all the time you need.

14:25.133 --> 14:26.334
Family's first, right?

14:34.893 --> 14:36.777
There he is.

14:36.845 --> 14:39.564
Steve, I'd like you to meet
Deputy Prosecutor Jim Chen.

14:39.648 --> 14:41.048
Steve McGarrett.
How do you do?

14:41.099 --> 14:42.383
Thanks for meeting me
like this.

14:42.434 --> 14:44.151
I'm just on my way to a lunch.
No, no problem.

14:44.219 --> 14:45.486
I appreciate it.

14:45.553 --> 14:47.321
Listen, did you get a chance
to pull

14:47.389 --> 14:49.156
Judge Kamalei's
threat file?

14:49.224 --> 14:50.324
It's all here.

14:50.392 --> 14:52.410
Kamalei's known
as a hanging judge.

14:52.494 --> 14:54.228
Put away a lot
of violent offenders.

14:54.279 --> 14:56.197
Not many get back
out on the street.

14:56.248 --> 14:57.865
Anyone on here stand out?

14:57.916 --> 14:59.400
Several.

14:59.468 --> 15:00.901
But if I were a betting man,

15:00.953 --> 15:02.670
I'd say Drew Parisi

15:02.738 --> 15:04.005
fits the M.O.
How so?

15:04.072 --> 15:05.406
Arson conviction.

15:05.474 --> 15:07.141
After his ex dumped him,

15:07.209 --> 15:09.010
Parisi rigged her house
to burn down.

15:09.077 --> 15:10.878
I'm sorry, you said
he rigged her house?

15:10.946 --> 15:12.763
This guy has technical skills?
Not only that,

15:12.848 --> 15:14.765
Jim said apparently this guy
was so pissed when the verdict

15:14.850 --> 15:16.317
was delivered, he attacked
the judge in open court.

15:16.385 --> 15:17.752
It took a bailiff

15:17.819 --> 15:19.687
and two armed officers to restrain him.
And he just got paroled?

15:19.754 --> 15:20.922
Three weeks ago.

15:20.989 --> 15:23.107
Only in America.
Yeah, only in America.

15:23.191 --> 15:24.942
You know his parole officer?

15:25.027 --> 15:26.527
Already spoke to him.

15:26.595 --> 15:28.729
Parisi is staying
at an old girlfriend's place

15:28.780 --> 15:30.498
in Wahiawa.

15:44.780 --> 15:46.047
Hey, stop by the
house on Sunday.

15:46.114 --> 15:47.882
Your mother would
love to see you.

15:47.949 --> 15:49.717
Will do. See you then.

15:52.287 --> 15:53.587
Hello.

15:53.655 --> 15:55.339
Very sweet.

15:55.424 --> 15:57.425
A lunch with your son.

15:57.476 --> 15:59.310
You must love him very much.

15:59.394 --> 16:00.594
Who is this?

16:00.662 --> 16:02.630
But a pat on the back?

16:02.698 --> 16:05.633
You should have given him a hug.

16:07.436 --> 16:08.402
Please,

16:08.470 --> 16:09.487
don't do this.

16:09.571 --> 16:11.672
I hope you said good-bye.

16:12.140 --> 16:13.741
Five-O!

16:13.808 --> 16:15.009
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

16:18.714 --> 16:19.780
Kyle!

16:19.831 --> 16:20.982
Get out of the car!

16:46.607 --> 16:49.409
Hey. What did he say
about the call?

16:49.460 --> 16:51.245
Same as Kamalei.

16:51.296 --> 16:53.480
Unknown number, male voice.

16:53.548 --> 16:55.249
"Hope you said good-bye."

16:55.316 --> 16:56.466
You okay?

16:56.551 --> 16:59.152
Yeah, I will be
once we find this scumbag.

16:59.220 --> 17:01.438
Well, we know it's not Parisi.

17:01.506 --> 17:02.590
No, we were right
there with him

17:02.641 --> 17:03.558
at the exact time
the bomb went off.

17:03.643 --> 17:05.493
That's right, and if it was
detonated by a remote trigger,

17:05.977 --> 17:07.694
then the bomber had
to have been close by.
Right.

17:08.563 --> 17:10.597
Is that a piece of the RF receiver?
Yeah, it is.

17:10.647 --> 17:13.032
This one's largely intact, and we got
a partial serial number right there.

17:13.101 --> 17:14.800
Nice. I'll run it down, see if we can
find out where it came from.

17:14.852 --> 17:16.987
All right.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.571
Hey, how goes
the canvass?

17:18.640 --> 17:19.940
Good. Got a lot
of foot traffic.

17:20.008 --> 17:21.074
Tourists taking photos.

17:21.142 --> 17:22.826
So I collected all their
cameras and cell phones,

17:22.910 --> 17:24.778
see what we get.
Well, one thing's for sure.

17:24.846 --> 17:26.445
This isn't just about
Judge Kamalei anymore.

17:26.497 --> 17:27.647
That's right.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.616
If we want to figure out
who this bomber is,

17:29.684 --> 17:31.484
we have to look at cases
involving Kamalei and Chen.

17:31.536 --> 17:33.337
My question is,
if it's about revenge,

17:33.421 --> 17:36.323
why not go after them?
Why target their kids?

17:39.360 --> 17:41.461
I understand. Mm-hmm.

17:41.512 --> 17:42.763
Yes.

17:44.132 --> 17:46.166
I'm going to see you
in a little bit.

17:46.217 --> 17:49.353
Yeah. I got to go.
I-I've got to go.

17:49.437 --> 17:50.554
What's happening?

17:50.638 --> 17:52.889
Hey. Um, I wasn't expecting
to see you

17:52.974 --> 17:54.391
for a little bit.

17:54.475 --> 17:57.510
I'm sorry. A guy can't
drop in on his brother?

17:57.562 --> 17:59.279
I see what you did there--
clever.

17:59.347 --> 18:00.414
Thank you.

18:00.481 --> 18:02.566
What are you doing, business?

18:02.650 --> 18:05.352
Uh, that? Uh, new client.

18:05.420 --> 18:06.519
Lives up on
the North Shore.

18:06.571 --> 18:08.855
I thought you were
on vacation.

18:08.906 --> 18:11.041
I am.
This, uh, this just came up.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.226
Who's, uh...

18:13.294 --> 18:15.362
Who's this new client?

18:15.413 --> 18:17.881
Uh, clients of mine
mentioned my name to him.

18:17.965 --> 18:20.250
He's, uh, he's got nine figures.
Made a small fortune

18:20.335 --> 18:21.968
through the
family business.

18:22.036 --> 18:24.537
So now he's looking for
some tax shelter ideas.

18:24.589 --> 18:26.206
What is his family business?

18:26.274 --> 18:27.391
A little of everything--

18:27.475 --> 18:30.560
shipping, utilities,
real estate stuff.

18:30.645 --> 18:32.646
It's just a coincidence
he's here in Hawaii?

18:34.015 --> 18:35.349
What's with the third degree,
Magnum?

18:35.400 --> 18:37.434
Are you looking
to poach my client?

18:37.518 --> 18:39.152
Yeah, I'm trying
to poach your client.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.887
I'm checking on my
little brother's career.

18:40.938 --> 18:44.057
Is that all right?
Checking up on me-- I like that.

18:44.108 --> 18:46.393
Apparently,
this guy's on a schedule.

18:46.461 --> 18:47.861
He needs to meet
right now, so...

18:47.929 --> 18:49.896
can we hang later?
Yeah, whatever you need.

18:49.947 --> 18:51.415
All right.

18:51.499 --> 18:52.916
You all right?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.203
I'm in Hawaii,
with my big brother.

18:56.254 --> 18:59.206
I'll see you in a little bit.
All right.

19:02.427 --> 19:04.577
I cross-referenced
Judge Kamalei's threat file

19:04.629 --> 19:06.930
with cases both he
and Chen had in common,

19:07.014 --> 19:08.815
focusing on violent offenders
and parolees.

19:08.883 --> 19:10.817
Okay, any matches?
No.

19:10.885 --> 19:13.754
So I started focusing on
the cameras and cell phones

19:13.821 --> 19:15.822
I collected
from the crime scene.

19:15.890 --> 19:18.325
All right, so several
tourists took photos

19:18.393 --> 19:19.626
just before or after
the explosion.

19:19.694 --> 19:20.927
All from different
angles.

19:20.978 --> 19:22.929
Okay, so what you're saying
is the killer might actually

19:22.980 --> 19:25.065
be in here somewhere?
Exactly.

19:25.133 --> 19:27.934
From the size of the tires,
we're looking for an SUV.

19:28.002 --> 19:29.403
What's that right there?

19:29.470 --> 19:32.155
Blow that up, Kono.
Put it up here for me.

19:34.509 --> 19:36.293
The wheel wells
are all muddy.

19:36.377 --> 19:38.311
What about
the treads?

19:39.847 --> 19:41.314
The tires are a match

19:41.382 --> 19:43.250
to the treads found near
the zip line platform.

19:43.301 --> 19:44.951
Did you get a clear shot
of the plates?

19:45.002 --> 19:47.621
No. But hey,

19:47.688 --> 19:49.322
what's that?

19:49.390 --> 19:50.824
That could be a rental tag.

19:50.892 --> 19:53.844
Okay, contact every
rental company on the Island.

19:53.928 --> 19:55.695
I want the name
of anybody driving a rental

19:55.763 --> 19:57.013
that make, model
and color, okay?

19:57.098 --> 19:58.231
All right, you got it.

19:59.434 --> 20:01.868
Danny, everything okay
with your brother?

20:01.936 --> 20:03.069
It's, uh, it's fine.

20:03.137 --> 20:04.971
I think I'm going to be
a little while, though.

20:05.022 --> 20:06.373
Why? What are you going to do?

20:06.441 --> 20:07.774
I got it. Don't worry about it.
It's nothing.

20:07.825 --> 20:09.943
Uh, okay, I know what
nothing means, so...

20:10.011 --> 20:12.996
Nothing means nothing,
Steven, okay? I'm fine.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.315
Okay, you know what, stop,
don't go anywhere.

20:15.366 --> 20:17.167
I'm going to be there soon.

20:19.921 --> 20:22.289
<i>I tracked down</i>
<i>this serial number.</i>

20:22.356 --> 20:24.341
It's to a circuit board for
a remote control airplane.

20:24.425 --> 20:26.092
A T-9 Sabrecat.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.462
I hear you're one of the only shops
on the Island that sell 'em, yeah?

20:28.513 --> 20:30.730
Yeah.
Sell any lately?

20:30.798 --> 20:33.567
Guy came looking to buy
last week.

20:33.634 --> 20:35.635
Oh, yeah. What he look like?

20:35.703 --> 20:37.671
<i>Haole.</i>

20:37.738 --> 20:40.307
Dark hair, goatee.

20:40.374 --> 20:42.309
He was dressed full-on

20:42.376 --> 20:43.877
Paniolo style,
boots and everything.

20:43.945 --> 20:45.078
Definitely no local.

20:45.146 --> 20:46.396
How you know that?

20:46.481 --> 20:47.714
The tan lines,

20:47.782 --> 20:48.982
the clothes.

20:49.050 --> 20:51.585
This cowboy--
he buy any of them?

20:51.652 --> 20:53.036
Three of them.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.037
Three?

20:54.121 --> 20:55.055
Yep.

20:55.122 --> 20:56.323
Paid in cash.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.258
And get this-- the remote
control to that plane

20:58.326 --> 20:59.826
has a range of a thousand feet.

20:59.877 --> 21:01.912
Those tire tracks I found
near the zip line platform

21:01.996 --> 21:03.046
are well within that.

21:03.130 --> 21:05.248
Well, then it looks like
we have one less target.

21:11.672 --> 21:13.056
Okay, would you
please slow down.

21:13.140 --> 21:14.224
You're getting too close.

21:14.308 --> 21:15.875
Danny, relax. He doesn't
know this truck.

21:15.927 --> 21:17.377
That's a good point.

21:19.514 --> 21:22.882
Stop. He's pulling
into that driveway.

21:30.908 --> 21:32.526
Yeah, hello.

21:32.577 --> 21:34.894
Is this Waioleka Charters?

21:34.946 --> 21:37.163
Yes, thank you.

21:37.231 --> 21:40.734
This is Clarence Clemons
from Matthew Williams' office.

21:40.801 --> 21:43.336
I'm just calling to check
on his itinerary.

21:43.404 --> 21:46.439
No listing? Okay.

21:46.507 --> 21:48.908
Hey, could you guys
just tell me one more time,

21:48.960 --> 21:50.477
where do you fly out of?

21:53.080 --> 21:55.448
Kaleola Airport.

21:55.516 --> 21:57.751
Thank you very much.

22:04.859 --> 22:08.194
This is so sick
that I'm doing this.

22:10.731 --> 22:11.998
MAN
Hands up.

22:20.157 --> 22:22.375
Matthew...

22:26.213 --> 22:28.949
Come. Come in.

22:30.685 --> 22:31.918
Good to see you.

22:31.986 --> 22:33.720
We have much business
to discuss.

22:36.807 --> 22:38.325
What happened?

22:38.392 --> 22:39.626
You lose the signal?

22:39.677 --> 22:41.961
Yeah. He said he was going
to a business meeting.

22:42.013 --> 22:45.565
Who pats you down before
a business meeting, hmm?

22:45.633 --> 22:47.734
Someone who doesn't
want to get caught.

23:04.732 --> 23:07.801
Who is responsible
for this suntan lotion job here?

23:07.869 --> 23:11.104
You missed a huge spot
on your nose, monkey.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.522
I didn't know
you were joining us.

23:12.607 --> 23:14.341
Sorry, man.
Slipped my mind.

23:14.409 --> 23:16.076
How did your meeting go?

23:16.144 --> 23:17.694
Really great, yeah.
Guy wanted

23:17.779 --> 23:19.579
to park $30 mil in
some tax-free munies.

23:19.647 --> 23:22.182
I'm like, "Really? Well,
bonds are dead money right now."

23:22.250 --> 23:23.417
$30 mil?

23:23.484 --> 23:24.651
That's impressive.

23:24.702 --> 23:26.319
What can I say?
I'm good at my job.

23:27.372 --> 23:28.588
Time for a swim.

23:30.341 --> 23:33.026
What is it that you do, exactly?
You just help

23:33.094 --> 23:35.595
the rich get out of paying
their taxes or what?

23:35.663 --> 23:36.680
In all fairness, I'd like

23:36.764 --> 23:38.198
to get everybody
out of their taxes,

23:38.266 --> 23:40.233
not just the rich.

23:40.301 --> 23:42.386
You know, people don't pay
taxes, then cops don't get paid,

23:42.470 --> 23:43.770
firefighters like Pop.

23:43.838 --> 23:44.838
You ever think
about that?

23:44.906 --> 23:45.906
Man, I'm kidding.

23:45.974 --> 23:48.008
Come on! Relax!
It's the beach.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.543
Uncle Matt!

23:49.610 --> 23:50.777
Fish!

23:50.812 --> 23:53.280
Where is that fish?!
Let me see it!

23:55.683 --> 23:58.418
I'm coming to get it!

23:58.486 --> 24:00.120
Right here?

24:04.459 --> 24:06.393
And what was that all about?

24:06.461 --> 24:08.078
What was what
all about?

24:08.162 --> 24:10.530
I assume you've heard

24:10.581 --> 24:12.065
the term
"passive-aggressive"?

24:12.133 --> 24:13.767
I wasn't being
passive-aggressive.

24:13.835 --> 24:16.536
No, you were being
aggressive-aggressive.

24:16.604 --> 24:17.871
The question is why?

24:17.922 --> 24:20.474
I don't know. He just gets under
my skin sometimes.

24:20.541 --> 24:23.810
Daniel, you can't lie to me.
What's wrong?

24:33.221 --> 24:35.605
All right,
I'm gonna tell you something.

24:35.690 --> 24:36.990
I need you to keep it
between us, okay?

24:37.058 --> 24:38.992
Okay?

24:40.695 --> 24:42.462
The other night when Steve and I
left dinner,

24:42.530 --> 24:43.830
the FBI was watching us.

24:43.898 --> 24:44.965
They're after Matt.

24:45.033 --> 24:47.234
What?

24:47.301 --> 24:50.170
They claim he's been scamming
his clients

24:50.237 --> 24:52.572
out of their life savings.

24:52.623 --> 24:53.774
Apparently, an indictment

24:53.841 --> 24:55.942
is on its way.

24:55.977 --> 24:57.611
Do you believe he's guilty?

24:57.678 --> 24:59.346
I don't want to.

24:59.413 --> 25:00.680
I'm waiting for a callback

25:00.748 --> 25:02.015
from a buddy
at the SEC.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.934
What does Matt have to say
about all of this?

25:04.018 --> 25:06.419
I have not spoken to him
about it.

25:06.471 --> 25:07.687
Daniel...

25:07.755 --> 25:10.190
What do you want me to do,
Rachel? What do I do?

25:10.257 --> 25:12.826
It's an active federal
investigation. I'm a cop.

25:12.894 --> 25:14.361
He's your brother.

25:20.368 --> 25:22.202
Wave. Wave to them.

25:25.540 --> 25:26.973
Hey, I'll tell you, man.

25:27.041 --> 25:28.992
Remember that time at the,
uh...oh, the Stone Pony?

25:29.077 --> 25:30.544
We snuck in to see Bruce.

25:30.611 --> 25:32.746
And that weird bouncer
with the three chicks?

25:32.814 --> 25:34.247
You want a beer?

25:34.298 --> 25:35.615
No, I'm good.

25:40.254 --> 25:41.588
Hey, I want to, uh...

25:41.639 --> 25:43.323
I want to talk to
you about something.

25:43.391 --> 25:45.225
Sit down for a second.

25:45.292 --> 25:46.459
It's about Rachel, isn't it?

25:46.511 --> 25:48.061
I knew you still loved her.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.396
I knew by the way

25:49.464 --> 25:51.398
that you looked at her
at dinner last night.

25:51.465 --> 25:52.983
I know you.
It's not about Rachel.

25:55.353 --> 25:58.522
So I'm just gonna ask you
once...

25:58.606 --> 26:01.441
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

26:01.509 --> 26:03.510
What's going on with you?

26:05.479 --> 26:07.313
Nothing. Why?

26:08.516 --> 26:12.919
Why? Because I spoke to a friend
at the SEC.

26:15.623 --> 26:17.057
What are you talking about?

26:17.125 --> 26:19.860
I'm talking
about your indictment.

26:19.927 --> 26:21.494
Matt,

26:21.546 --> 26:23.663
you've been stealing money

26:23.714 --> 26:24.798
from your clients, huh?

26:24.849 --> 26:26.299
Danny, that...
that's insane, okay?

26:26.350 --> 26:28.268
It's just... doesn't even...

26:28.335 --> 26:30.103
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying!

26:30.171 --> 26:31.171
Listen to me! Who do you think

26:31.222 --> 26:32.639
you're talking to, huh?!

26:32.707 --> 26:35.058
You think you're talking to
one of your dopey clients?!

26:35.143 --> 26:36.509
I'm your brother!
You don't lie to me!

26:36.561 --> 26:38.011
What do you want to hear,
that I took the money?

26:41.566 --> 26:43.950
Fine. I took the money.

26:51.459 --> 26:53.293
What were you thinking about?

26:55.963 --> 26:57.497
You do something that stupid,
you think about Mom?

26:57.548 --> 26:58.665
You think about Dad?

26:58.733 --> 27:00.884
You think about our sisters?
I know.

27:00.968 --> 27:02.035
You know they're gonna come
knocking at Mom's door?

27:02.103 --> 27:03.386
Calling her in the
middle of the night

27:03.471 --> 27:05.088
asking for statements?
I know, okay? I made a mistake.

27:05.173 --> 27:06.973
Is that what
you've been waiting for?

27:07.041 --> 27:08.226
What, you think I get a kick
out of this?

27:08.299 --> 27:09.333
I enjoy this?

27:09.369 --> 27:11.971
I think that you like to be
the guy that everybody thinks

27:12.022 --> 27:15.274
does everything right, but we
both know that you made mistakes.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.605
Why? Why?

27:20.690 --> 27:22.791
That's all I want to know. Why?

27:27.630 --> 27:32.734
I lost $58 million in one day.

27:32.802 --> 27:35.404
And I had
to cover it.

27:35.471 --> 27:40.375
So I took some money
from my other clients' accounts.

27:40.443 --> 27:42.945
I fixed statements.

27:43.012 --> 27:46.448
I was hoping that if I could
cover my tracks,

27:46.516 --> 27:48.517
that no one would be
the wiser,

27:48.568 --> 27:50.953
and then one lie
led to another

27:51.020 --> 27:52.421
and then the next one
and the next.

27:52.488 --> 27:53.605
Why didn't you come to me?

27:53.690 --> 27:55.223
You're a cop.

27:55.275 --> 27:56.391
I knew
that you would...

27:56.459 --> 27:58.460
I'm your brother.
I would have helped you.

27:58.528 --> 28:01.864
I thought
about turning myself in,

28:01.915 --> 28:03.565
then I just couldn't.

28:03.633 --> 28:05.117
Why'd you come to Hawaii?

28:07.871 --> 28:09.938
To cut another deal,

28:10.006 --> 28:11.740
and try to buy
my way out,

28:11.808 --> 28:15.911
but, uh... it fell through.

28:15.979 --> 28:18.447
Okay.

28:18.514 --> 28:20.449
Okay, here's what...

28:20.516 --> 28:24.186
Okay, we're getting on a plane
together

28:24.253 --> 28:26.939
and we're going back
to New York, okay?

28:27.023 --> 28:28.523
You're gonna talk
to the FBI,

28:28.591 --> 28:30.309
you're gonna talk to the SEC
and you're going

28:30.393 --> 28:31.526
to cop to everything,

28:31.594 --> 28:32.561
you understand?

28:32.629 --> 28:33.762
I'll go to jail.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.631
Yeah, you're probably gonna
go to jail.

28:35.698 --> 28:36.965
Minimum-security.

28:37.033 --> 28:39.868
All right, we're gonna
get you a good lawyer.

28:39.936 --> 28:42.404
All right, I'm personally
gonna talk

28:42.472 --> 28:44.806
to the district attorney,
and I'm gonna be there with you

28:44.874 --> 28:46.508
and we're gonna get through this
together.

28:53.616 --> 28:56.284
This is gonna kill Mom and Dad.

28:56.336 --> 28:58.720
Okay, listen to me.

28:58.788 --> 29:01.306
Um, we got a long road ahead.

29:01.391 --> 29:04.893
We're going back home.
I want you to pack a bag.

29:04.961 --> 29:07.346
I'll be back in a
couple of hours.

29:15.137 --> 29:17.106
I cross-checked red SUV rentals
with cases

29:17.157 --> 29:19.942
that involved both Kamalei
and Chen, and I got a hit.

29:20.693 --> 29:23.478
Travis Roan, age 49, current
resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.846
No local address.

29:24.914 --> 29:26.331
And he used to work
on a demo team.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.367
So he knows his way around
a construction site.

29:28.451 --> 29:29.551
And he spent seven years

29:29.619 --> 29:31.987
in the Wyoming State Pen
for aggravated assault.

29:32.055 --> 29:33.321
Okay, but Wyoming?
I don't understand.

29:33.373 --> 29:34.373
Was he tried here?

29:34.457 --> 29:36.425
No, but his son was.

29:39.729 --> 29:42.631
Thomas Roan.
Yeah. 20 years old.

29:42.682 --> 29:45.166
Got 18 months
for a DUI,

29:45.218 --> 29:46.401
then got stabbed
in a mess hall fight.

29:46.469 --> 29:48.837
Died in prison ten days ago.
Oh, man.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.890
And Kamalei and Chen
put him there, right?

29:51.975 --> 29:54.743
This guy's looking for payback
for his dead son.

29:54.811 --> 29:57.362
So I pulled Thomas' case
and I spoke to the judge

29:57.447 --> 29:59.448
trying to figure out
our last potential target.

29:59.515 --> 30:01.149
Maybe an arresting officer,
a key witness.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.452
But all Judge Kamalei
can remember about the case

30:03.519 --> 30:05.454
was the flood of appeals
that came after his verdict.

30:05.521 --> 30:06.955
Who filed the appeals?

30:07.023 --> 30:09.024
Thomas' mom.

30:09.092 --> 30:11.259
Court paperwork shows
a local address for her.

30:11.327 --> 30:13.045
Maybe she can help us find
Travis Roan.

30:19.836 --> 30:22.054
I can't believe it.

30:22.088 --> 30:25.340
Oh, my God,
those poor children.

30:25.408 --> 30:26.975
Do you know where Travis is
right now?

30:27.043 --> 30:30.846
Back in Wyoming, I thought.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.981
He was only in town
for Thomas' funeral.

30:33.049 --> 30:35.417
We're very sorry to hear
about what happened to your son.

30:35.485 --> 30:39.388
Thomas couldn't wait
to leave Cheyenne.

30:39.455 --> 30:42.824
Said this place
was like paradise.

30:42.892 --> 30:45.694
Then first semester, he got
pulled over for a DUI.

30:45.762 --> 30:48.463
The judge and that prosecutor
had to make an example of him.

30:48.531 --> 30:50.749
What do you mean
by that?

30:50.833 --> 30:55.203
It was the third DUI that week
right in the heart of Waikiki.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.173
It didn't help that Thomas was
underage and hit a fancy car.

30:58.241 --> 31:00.842
So instead of probation or
getting his license revoked...

31:00.910 --> 31:02.277
He got 18 months.

31:02.345 --> 31:04.179
I tried to appeal,

31:04.247 --> 31:06.248
moved down here to do so.

31:06.315 --> 31:07.582
How did your
ex-husband take that?

31:07.650 --> 31:10.252
Hard. They wouldn't even let him
visit his son.

31:10.319 --> 31:13.155
Former felons aren't allowed.

31:13.222 --> 31:16.958
Thomas was only 13 when his
father went away to Rawlins.

31:17.026 --> 31:19.945
They wrote letters and such,
but they hadn't seen

31:20.029 --> 31:21.430
each other since.

31:21.497 --> 31:23.965
Ma'am, did Travis ever...

31:24.033 --> 31:27.436
did he ever make any threats
or maybe mention anybody else

31:27.503 --> 31:29.438
that he blamed
for Thomas' death?

31:29.505 --> 31:30.806
No.

31:30.873 --> 31:34.609
No, the only thing he kept
saying at the funeral was

31:34.677 --> 31:36.628
he never got to say good-bye.

31:41.167 --> 31:43.585
Mrs. Roan,
this is very important.

31:43.653 --> 31:46.755
We need to know where
Travis was staying.

32:02.705 --> 32:03.872
We're clear.

32:06.109 --> 32:07.876
He was just here.

32:07.944 --> 32:10.028
The sink's still wet,
looks like he shaved.

32:10.113 --> 32:13.381
I got a photo and letters
from Thomas to his dad.

32:18.921 --> 32:20.922
Chin, I got the kits.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.633
The last remote is gone.

32:31.701 --> 32:33.051
We're running
out of time.

32:33.136 --> 32:35.303
Hold on, I got something here.
These letters...

32:35.371 --> 32:37.639
Roan's blaming someone named
"Meachum."

32:37.707 --> 32:38.857
Says, "She sold me out.

32:38.941 --> 32:41.359
She convinced me
to take the deal."

32:41.444 --> 32:42.727
That's his lawyer.

32:42.812 --> 32:44.412
Public defender.
Right.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.047
Our next target.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.217
<i>Pi'ikoi Middle School?</i>

32:49.285 --> 32:51.153
Yeah, I'm, like, two minutes
away from there. Why?

32:51.204 --> 32:52.654
Because that's where
our suspect is headed.

32:52.722 --> 32:54.856
He's after Brian Meachum,
the public defender's kid.

32:54.924 --> 32:56.491
All right.
You got an ID on this guy?

32:56.542 --> 32:57.692
Yeah, the guy's name
is Travis Roan.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.212
He's driving a red SUV,
it's a rental.

33:00.296 --> 33:01.913
I'm sending you
a picture right now.

33:01.998 --> 33:03.248
Danny, listen to me, okay?

33:03.332 --> 33:05.567
Get a visual on this guy,
and then proceed

33:05.635 --> 33:07.402
with extreme caution.
He is highly unstable,

33:07.470 --> 33:09.838
and he's carrying explosives.

33:14.477 --> 33:17.112
Looking for this,
Mr. Meachum?

33:17.180 --> 33:19.281
Yeah.

33:19.348 --> 33:20.615
Found it by the gym.

33:20.683 --> 33:22.350
Somebody must be
messing with you.

33:22.418 --> 33:24.102
Thanks.

33:25.354 --> 33:28.907
You be careful, now.

33:28.991 --> 33:32.561
Your homework.

33:32.628 --> 33:33.945
Always remember to
double-check it.

33:34.030 --> 33:35.730
Right. Thanks again.

33:48.753 --> 33:50.104
Kono, any luck
reaching Diana Meachum?

33:50.188 --> 33:51.555
No, straight to voice mail.

33:51.606 --> 33:54.625
But DMV database shows
she's driving a beige minivan,

33:54.693 --> 33:56.110
license plate: Charlie, Bravo,

33:56.194 --> 33:58.062
zero, three, two, five.

33:58.129 --> 34:00.447
Okay, got it. Listen,
remember that transmitter

34:00.532 --> 34:01.732
is only good for a
thousand feet, okay?

34:01.783 --> 34:03.117
You locate the Meachums,

34:03.201 --> 34:06.453
Roan can't be far away,
so be careful.

34:29.944 --> 34:32.596
Why do you always set
your phone on vibrate?

34:32.664 --> 34:34.665
It's a little embarrassing
when it goes off in court.

34:34.733 --> 34:37.735
Maybe you should answer it.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.770
This is Diana.

34:39.821 --> 34:41.071
Mrs. Meachum.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.773
This is Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett from Five-O.

34:42.824 --> 34:44.824
You're in danger right now.

34:44.909 --> 34:47.327
You need to get out of your car,
and move away, right away.

34:47.411 --> 34:49.295
Don't touch anything.
Brian, get out of the car right now. Get out.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.813
Just go. Go.

34:58.223 --> 35:00.457
Get the Meachums.

35:00.525 --> 35:03.260
Steve, over here.

35:03.328 --> 35:05.896
Five-O, hands where
I can see them.

35:07.932 --> 35:11.602
Hey. I need you to step out
of the car slowly, all right?

35:11.669 --> 35:14.037
That boy...

35:14.105 --> 35:16.523
he's only 13 years old.

35:19.310 --> 35:23.714
Just like Thomas was
when I last saw him.

35:23.782 --> 35:26.683
Just like Thomas.

35:29.454 --> 35:30.854
Now he's gone.

35:31.890 --> 35:33.891
He's gone.

35:35.326 --> 35:37.161
I lost him.

35:37.228 --> 35:38.395
I lost him.

35:39.798 --> 35:42.065
I lost him.

35:42.133 --> 35:44.535
Get out of the car, out,
out, out, out. Now.

35:44.602 --> 35:46.603
Get down on the ground.

35:46.671 --> 35:48.539
Hands behind your back.

36:06.407 --> 36:08.408
I gotta go pick
up my brother.

36:12.463 --> 36:14.464
He was going to run.

36:16.634 --> 36:19.419
Can you believe that?

36:19.504 --> 36:22.556
Charter company got back to me
with the flight manifest,

36:22.640 --> 36:25.759
and he used our third-grade
gym teacher's name

36:25.844 --> 36:28.896
to book the flight.

36:28.980 --> 36:32.349
He was going to skip out
first thing in the morning.

36:32.417 --> 36:34.902
Sorry, man.

36:34.986 --> 36:37.321
Yeah, me, too.

36:37.388 --> 36:39.389
Let me give you guys
a ride to the airport.

36:39.440 --> 36:40.824
Nah, you don't
have to do that.

36:40.892 --> 36:42.743
Come on. Come on,
we'll talk in the truck.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.405
He's not here.

36:55.473 --> 36:57.457
MAN 2:
Where the hell
did he go?

37:01.613 --> 37:03.079
Five-O!

37:06.134 --> 37:07.651
Hey, hey, hey!
Stand down. Stand down.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.271
Where the hell is he? Hmm?
What'd you say to him?

37:11.356 --> 37:13.957
What's going on?
What are you talking about?

37:14.025 --> 37:15.309
Well, we lost
the tail on your brother.

37:15.393 --> 37:17.661
Phone's dead, he switched
cars, and when we got

37:17.729 --> 37:18.962
to the meet, there
was no one there.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.731
He tipped them off
before the deal ever went down.

37:20.798 --> 37:23.600
Stop. Stop, okay?
I have no idea

37:23.668 --> 37:25.002
what you're saying to me
right now. You understand?

37:25.069 --> 37:27.571
What meet? What deal?
What are you talking about?

37:27.639 --> 37:29.640
Come here.

37:30.992 --> 37:32.960
The footage is courtesy
of the DEA.

37:33.044 --> 37:34.845
Guy in the black shirt
is Pedro Fuentes,

37:34.913 --> 37:37.981
accountant for the third most
powerful cartel in Columbia.

37:38.049 --> 37:40.684
And your brother...
is making a deal

37:40.752 --> 37:41.885
to launder
his drug money.

37:42.921 --> 37:45.055
How much can you handle?

37:45.123 --> 37:46.590
Ten?

37:46.658 --> 37:47.991
Ten million should be fine.

37:48.059 --> 37:50.327
Once I get it in and out
of Singapore.

37:50.395 --> 37:53.797
And the meet was
supposed to go down today.

37:53.848 --> 37:56.299
You had no idea?

37:56.351 --> 37:58.502
We had it all set up.

37:58.569 --> 38:00.170
We were gonna take them all down
as soon as we saw the money.

38:00.238 --> 38:03.707
Yeah, except sometime today,
your brother changed the plan.

38:03.775 --> 38:06.176
And now they've
all gone under.

38:06.244 --> 38:09.980
If you have any idea
where your brother is,

38:10.048 --> 38:11.865
you need to tell us
right now, Detective.

38:11.950 --> 38:13.684
I have no clue.

38:13.751 --> 38:15.852
You understand me?

38:18.623 --> 38:20.057
What?

38:20.124 --> 38:21.658
You gotta tell him.

38:21.726 --> 38:23.377
You... you gotta tell him.

38:23.428 --> 38:24.728
I gotta tell him what?

38:24.796 --> 38:27.014
Tell him what you told me.

38:28.466 --> 38:32.219
His brother's got plans
to leave the Island.

38:32.303 --> 38:33.537
McGarrett, you know
where Williams is?

38:38.142 --> 38:39.743
Yeah, I do. He's got a boat

38:39.811 --> 38:42.145
near Kawela Bay, on
the North Shore, okay?

38:42.213 --> 38:43.563
I'm sorry, Danny.

38:43.648 --> 38:45.882
All right, you heard him,
let's go, people!

38:51.906 --> 38:53.690
Thank you.

39:02.300 --> 39:03.667
MATT
Hey, this is Matt.

39:03.735 --> 39:05.201
You know what to do.

39:18.933 --> 39:20.901
Matty. Matty.

39:20.985 --> 39:23.487
Matthew Williams, hey!

39:29.393 --> 39:31.445
You going to shoot me, Danny?

39:31.529 --> 39:33.830
I should shoot you,
you stupid son of a bitch.

39:33.898 --> 39:36.266
Huh? Laundering money
for drug dealers?

39:36.334 --> 39:37.334
What the hell's the
matter with you?

39:37.402 --> 39:39.086
I had no choice.

39:39.170 --> 39:41.405
You did have a choice. You had
a choice. I gave you a choice!

39:41.472 --> 39:43.340
I said I was
gonna help you.

39:43.408 --> 39:45.242
I said I was gonna get you
through this. Didn't I?

39:45.309 --> 39:47.244
It's not that simple, Danny.

39:47.311 --> 39:50.814
This isn't you beating up Cousin
Jimmy because he stole my bike.

39:50.882 --> 39:53.583
Matthew, listen to me, you are
going to turn yourself in.

39:53.651 --> 39:55.318
You are gonna turn yourself in!

39:55.386 --> 39:57.554
Go to federal prison?

39:57.622 --> 39:59.222
I'd never survive, Danny.

39:59.273 --> 40:01.274
I'm not strong enough.
I'm not you!

40:02.326 --> 40:04.594
What the hell
is the matter with you?

40:04.662 --> 40:05.662
Huh?

40:05.730 --> 40:07.064
What'd you do? Huh?

40:07.131 --> 40:08.932
You went through with it?
What is that?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.167
Is that getaway money?

40:10.234 --> 40:13.770
It wasn't supposed
to be a getaway, Danny.

40:13.838 --> 40:15.105
I was trying to f...

40:15.173 --> 40:16.439
I was trying to fix things.

40:16.491 --> 40:19.275
Trying to fix things?

40:19.327 --> 40:21.277
So what are you going to do?

40:21.329 --> 40:24.481
Huh? Just going to run away?

40:24.549 --> 40:27.150
You're going to fly off and
you're going to forget about us?

40:27.218 --> 40:28.485
Huh? Is that your plan?

40:28.553 --> 40:31.221
Hey! I'm asking
you a question!

40:31.289 --> 40:33.156
What about Mom and Dad?

40:33.224 --> 40:34.825
Huh? What about Grace?

40:37.862 --> 40:41.231
We're your
family, Matty.

40:46.804 --> 40:50.407
This ends one of two ways,
big brother.

40:50.475 --> 40:54.911
You either shoot me,
or you say good-bye.
