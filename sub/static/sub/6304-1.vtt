00:32.854 --> 00:34.357
You all right, Frank?

00:37.748 --> 00:39.881
It's gonna be one hell of a blister.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.086
Well, how does it look?

00:43.146 --> 00:44.805
Not good.

00:46.866 --> 00:48.449
Engine's cooked.

00:59.533 --> 01:01.569
- You making the call?
- Yes.

01:01.646 --> 01:04.361
But it would help if I could get
some reception.

01:16.972 --> 01:18.235
Shit.

01:25.130 --> 01:28.574
You remember what that station attendant
called this stretch of road here?

01:28.651 --> 01:31.419
He called it Devil's Pass, Frank. Why?

02:03.239 --> 02:05.144
I'm having the best time.

02:14.947 --> 02:18.327
Leslie, pace yourself.
We're just starting out.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.728
I know. We're just starting
and already I feel so great.

02:20.804 --> 02:22.551
Come on.

02:22.627 --> 02:24.502
- Here, have it.
- No.

02:25.442 --> 02:27.092
Do you want to drive?

02:29.057 --> 02:30.801
Never mind.

04:35.513 --> 04:38.282
- Em, slow down, slow down.
- Why? What?

04:38.840 --> 04:41.068
Oh, he's so cute.

04:41.144 --> 04:44.675
- Can we pick him up?
- No! We are not picking anybody up.

04:46.423 --> 04:47.662
Leslie, don't!

04:47.739 --> 04:51.470
This road is, like, it's a magnet
for serial killers. You know that?

04:51.990 --> 04:54.171
Oh, my God. Really?

04:55.285 --> 04:59.208
No, I just made it up, but what
would you have done if he was?

04:59.285 --> 05:01.383
Slit his throat first.

05:03.027 --> 05:06.948
- Jesus, Leslie. Did I just hear you right?
- I need a beer.

05:08.313 --> 05:11.063
Oh, come on. Don't... don't do that!

05:11.954 --> 05:14.235
Hey, chill out. No need for the drama.

05:14.312 --> 05:16.676
There is no drama. I am driving.

05:16.753 --> 05:19.044
- You want to die?
- No. I don't want to die.

05:19.121 --> 05:22.051
No, neither do I.
My life is extremely valuable to me.

05:22.128 --> 05:25.123
- And I... are you even listening?
- Of course I am.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.441
Hey, Jim.

05:27.518 --> 05:29.317
Yeah, it's Leslie.

05:29.394 --> 05:31.520
Yeah, Emily's driving.

05:33.325 --> 05:36.096
I don't... hold on. I'll ask.
What was the excuse you gave, again?

05:36.173 --> 05:40.159
That I was visiting my sister in
Sacramento for a few days. What else?

05:40.236 --> 05:44.669
Did you get that? I know. I cannot believe
she's going through with this either.

05:44.746 --> 05:46.941
It's like we have the old Emily back.

05:47.476 --> 05:50.748
We've got like two bags of weed,
some tequila, some rum...

05:50.824 --> 05:53.883
...some gin and two cases of beer?

05:53.960 --> 05:56.329
Yeah, the way you're going,
we're almost out of beer.

06:00.357 --> 06:02.714
Well, see you guys in a couple of hours.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.529
And will you say "hey" to Dick for me?

06:06.469 --> 06:09.945
Rick, Dick, whatever. Just tell him
we look forward to seeing him.

06:10.904 --> 06:14.488
Jim? Hello. Hello? Hello?

06:15.140 --> 06:16.919
Lost our reception.

06:17.571 --> 06:19.765
I just want to get there already!

06:20.609 --> 06:22.355
Who's Dick?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.076
Who's Dick?

06:53.152 --> 06:56.052
- Just the guy you're gonna fuck.
- Excuse me?

06:56.128 --> 06:57.811
I know that there's
this little complication...

06:57.888 --> 07:01.938
No, Randy is no complication.
Okay? He's my boyfriend.

07:02.686 --> 07:06.228
I feel real shitty about
lying to him about this trip.

07:06.976 --> 07:09.744
- What if he finds out?
- Who cares? Payback's a bitch.

07:09.821 --> 07:12.784
No, there's not gonna be any payback, Leslie.

07:13.148 --> 07:15.088
I still care for him.

07:16.123 --> 07:20.108
And I'm not just gonna fuck some stranger
to satisfy my own insecurities.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.202
Why not? He did.

07:25.992 --> 07:28.842
I guess that's why you're
still wearing the bracelet.

07:42.198 --> 07:44.011
You're so damn trusting, Em.

07:45.877 --> 07:49.446
Because my gut's telling me
that this guy does not deserve you.

07:51.155 --> 07:52.902
You really believe that?

07:57.938 --> 08:00.069
You know what? Things'll change.

08:00.146 --> 08:04.581
I just... I have to toughen up
a little. That's all.

08:05.329 --> 08:08.667
My advice, toughen up a lot.

08:09.838 --> 08:11.967
Oh, my God! Stop!

08:15.244 --> 08:17.597
What? What?

08:20.427 --> 08:22.166
Yeah, I think we go left here.

08:22.444 --> 08:24.252
You think?

08:26.665 --> 08:27.677
What does the GPS say?

08:27.754 --> 08:30.649
I don't know. The stupid thing
stopped working hours ago.

08:31.018 --> 08:33.370
This fucking piece of shit.

08:40.359 --> 08:42.139
Come on.

08:42.215 --> 08:44.408
It'll be an adventure if we're wrong.

08:49.669 --> 08:51.447
Fuck it.

11:12.674 --> 11:14.421
Oh, God!

11:20.321 --> 11:22.169
Diesel exhaust is the worst.

11:28.671 --> 11:32.369
- Has this guy never heard of climate change?
- Obviously not.

11:37.117 --> 11:40.274
Come on, what's his deal?
Why doesn't he just move over for us?

11:40.350 --> 11:42.671
Come on, asshole! We don't have all day!

11:52.811 --> 11:54.941
So what are you waiting for, girl? Pass him.

12:17.242 --> 12:19.887
It's too risky, I'll take him at the summit.

13:05.241 --> 13:07.372
Great. We need gas.

13:07.449 --> 13:09.761
Oh, good, because I have to fucking pee.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.583
That's quite the beast?

14:04.660 --> 14:06.758
- Yeah.
- Nice car.

14:06.835 --> 14:08.965
- Thank you.
- Fill 'er up for you?

14:09.042 --> 14:11.170
Yeah. Yes, please.

14:15.118 --> 14:18.882
I'm dyin' to see what you got under the hood.
Check your oil for you?

14:18.958 --> 14:20.704
Knock yourself out.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.158
Reception.

14:33.355 --> 14:34.866
<i>Hello.</i>

14:35.724 --> 14:37.791
- Jill?
- <i>It is. Who's this?</i>

14:37.868 --> 14:39.013
It's Emily.

14:39.090 --> 14:42.430
<i>Oh, hey there, Emily.
Sorry, I didn't recognize your voice.</i>

14:43.514 --> 14:46.842
- Is Randy there?
- <i>Yes, just a second.</i>

14:50.023 --> 14:53.179
- <i>Hey, Em, how's your trip going?</i>
- What is she doing there?

14:53.256 --> 14:54.714
<i>You knew I was working from home.</i>

14:54.791 --> 14:57.849
You didn't answer my question.
What's she doing?

14:57.926 --> 15:01.384
<i>Jill was kind enough to bring over some files
that I needed from the office.</i>

15:01.461 --> 15:03.465
They couldn't be couriered?

15:03.973 --> 15:05.560
<i>They could have, I suppose.</i>

15:05.637 --> 15:08.503
Oh, man. You know
how I feel about that woman.

15:08.580 --> 15:10.445
How would you like it
if one of my co-workers...

15:10.522 --> 15:13.367
...tried to bone me
at one of my office parties?

15:13.443 --> 15:17.289
<i>I wouldn't. I just don't know
why you keep bringing it up.</i>

15:17.922 --> 15:20.405
Because you did nothing to discourage it.

15:20.482 --> 15:22.483
<i>So what are you saying?</i>

15:26.815 --> 15:29.970
- <i>Are you still there?</i>
- You're right.

15:30.335 --> 15:33.874
Of course, you're right. I need to stop
blaming you for my insecurities.

15:33.951 --> 15:37.510
I'll... just need to toughen up a little.

15:37.587 --> 15:41.102
- A lot.
- <i>Well, that would be a good start.</i>

15:47.274 --> 15:48.789
<i>Em?</i>

15:49.403 --> 15:51.371
<i>You know I love you, right?</i>

16:06.296 --> 16:08.236
You called him, didn't you?

16:08.792 --> 16:10.187
Yeah.

16:10.264 --> 16:12.200
What am I gonna do with you?

16:15.348 --> 16:17.256
Tell me more about Dick.

16:17.333 --> 16:21.252
I knew you'd come around.
He's so hot. You're gonna love him.

16:25.553 --> 16:28.604
Oh, I think his name is... Rick?

16:34.512 --> 16:36.611
- How much do I owe you?
- $38.50, ma'am.

16:36.688 --> 16:39.072
But you're a little low on oil.

16:42.029 --> 16:45.184
I think we should leave now, before
you-know-who gets back on the road.

16:45.261 --> 16:48.735
Good idea. I'll fill 'er up at the next stop.

16:48.812 --> 16:53.115
Suit yourself. Just don't wait too long.
You might end up thrashing the engine.

18:14.888 --> 18:16.633
What's going on?

18:18.215 --> 18:20.156
Oh, my God, watch out!

18:21.096 --> 18:23.257
Just move. Move, asshole.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.248
What?

18:58.660 --> 19:00.440
Can you believe this guy?

19:01.093 --> 19:04.928
Well, what are you waiting for, Em?
Pass him before he changes his mind.

19:12.408 --> 19:14.539
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

19:16.160 --> 19:18.676
He's... he did that on purpose?

19:18.752 --> 19:21.331
He's... he's trying to fucking kill us.

19:21.408 --> 19:23.217
That other car, too.

19:25.053 --> 19:27.121
What is with him? We passed him
a couple of fucking times...

19:27.198 --> 19:28.944
...and he goes flying off the fucking hanger!

19:29.021 --> 19:32.362
He's got to be fuckin' crazy. He's gotta be.
No one else would fucking act like this.

19:37.370 --> 19:40.632
Hey, fuck this. It's either his job
or our lives. Speed up, Em.

19:40.709 --> 19:43.819
I want you to read off the numbers
on the back of the truck there.

19:48.152 --> 19:50.719
- Five-five-five...
- Yeah.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.975
- One-two...
- Yeah.

19:53.368 --> 19:55.019
Six-five.

19:55.096 --> 19:58.005
Fuck! There's no service.

20:08.116 --> 20:09.845
I can't take the smell.

20:15.186 --> 20:17.541
Time to leave this guy in the dust.

20:23.378 --> 20:25.093
Idiot!

20:25.170 --> 20:27.909
- "Idiot"? Is that what you got, Em?
- What else do you want me to say?

20:27.985 --> 20:30.280
Fuck you, you fuckin' asshole!

20:31.459 --> 20:33.367
Don't do that again.

20:33.443 --> 20:34.750
What?

20:56.941 --> 20:59.552
Hey, sit back. Relax. Enjoy the ride.

20:59.629 --> 21:01.822
Smooth sailing from here on.

21:11.114 --> 21:13.055
Wake me when we get to Palm Springs.

21:13.131 --> 21:14.876
Come on.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.195
Don't get too comfortable.

22:26.567 --> 22:28.312
Just pass.

22:38.630 --> 22:40.634
What the hell is he trying to prove?

22:40.711 --> 22:42.514
No idea.

23:19.236 --> 23:23.353
This is a joke, right? This has gotta be some
fucking sick fucking perverted joke, right?

23:23.429 --> 23:25.656
Because what else could this
fucking be, you fuckin' asshole?

23:25.733 --> 23:28.056
Stop yelling, okay? Stop yelling.

23:28.132 --> 23:31.094
It's not helping. Just please, sit there.

23:31.171 --> 23:33.364
Let me handle this, okay?

23:34.785 --> 23:36.928
Yeah, fine. Handle it.

23:50.238 --> 23:52.754
- I was right, wasn't I?
- Yeah. It's just a joke.

23:52.831 --> 23:56.476
This is one big fucking joke,
you fucking asshole!

23:58.364 --> 24:00.528
Easy. Easy, Em.

24:01.660 --> 24:05.353
I got this. I got it, I got it.
Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!

24:15.352 --> 24:17.513
Easy, easy.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.776
Fuck you!

24:46.868 --> 24:48.804
Last we see of him.

24:50.994 --> 24:52.803
Way to go, Em.

25:22.638 --> 25:24.962
Don't let him catch up to us.
Just go. Drive, drive.

25:25.039 --> 25:26.738
He's gonna fucking kill us, Em.

25:39.596 --> 25:41.054
Brace yourself.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.899
Oh, fuck.

26:02.855 --> 26:04.610
Come on.

26:06.215 --> 26:08.536
- No reception.
- Yeah.

26:09.478 --> 26:11.223
Come on.

26:14.516 --> 26:16.710
- Fuck!
- Hey.

26:17.699 --> 26:19.701
We're still alive, okay?

26:20.642 --> 26:22.387
We're still alive.

26:46.495 --> 26:49.311
I walk like that after
a night of heavy poundin'.

26:49.388 --> 26:52.434
Yeah, we're just in
a little discomfort, that's all.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.546
Nothing a few painkillers can't cure.

26:54.622 --> 26:56.715
Oh, I know all about discomfort, sweetie.

26:56.792 --> 27:01.074
You try working this joint with these
God-awful corns I got growin' on my toes.

27:02.877 --> 27:04.398
Take your order?

27:08.636 --> 27:10.768
Let's just make that two coffees, please.

27:10.845 --> 27:13.295
Two it is. I will come back for your orders.

27:13.372 --> 27:15.247
And a fork you can eat with.

27:15.419 --> 27:16.859
Thank you.

27:27.928 --> 27:29.708
He's back.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.746
- What?
- No, no, don't.

27:32.823 --> 27:34.264
I just said he's back.

27:34.341 --> 27:38.344
- His truck's parked out there in the lot.
- But he fucking left.

27:38.421 --> 27:41.704
We saw him, we saw him leave.
Why would he come back for us...

27:41.780 --> 27:44.263
- ...what does he want from us?
- I've got no idea, just...

27:44.340 --> 27:47.684
...just be quiet while I try
and figure out who it is.

28:21.969 --> 28:23.491
Him.

28:26.513 --> 28:28.664
I'm not sure,
but there are two possibilities.

28:28.741 --> 28:32.795
Two possibilities? We shouldn't even be
here. I want to get back on the road...

28:32.871 --> 28:36.451
Save it, sweetie,
ain't got no reception around here.

28:36.528 --> 28:40.393
I know that. Do you have a house
phone maybe that we could use?

28:40.470 --> 28:42.402
Well, you could, but it ain't working.

28:42.479 --> 28:45.557
Of course it's not working,
because nothing works in this shithole.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.028
Excuse me?

28:47.104 --> 28:49.715
Can I get a soup in a cup or a bowl?

28:49.888 --> 28:51.698
Heather, hold up.

28:51.775 --> 28:54.098
You know what?
We will just have two cheeseburgers.

28:54.174 --> 28:55.887
How does that sound, Leslie?

28:57.661 --> 29:01.391
- Two cheeseburgers? Anything else?
- No, thank you. That'll be all.

29:01.468 --> 29:04.462
By the way, just a little further up the
road, there's a rest stop by the summit...

29:04.539 --> 29:09.129
- ...you might get some reception up there.
- We'll try there. Thank you.

29:10.566 --> 29:12.695
You need to tone it down a notch.

29:17.940 --> 29:19.881
Look, it's almost noon.

29:19.957 --> 29:23.528
This is probably the only diner
around for miles.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.036
Probably comes here all the time to eat.

29:26.112 --> 29:28.775
May be he was just going
too fast down the hill...

29:28.851 --> 29:34.083
...he had to slow down,
just turned around, and... that's all.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.660
- That's all.
- I think we should leave.

29:39.121 --> 29:41.540
That way if he follows us
we'll know his true intentions.

29:41.616 --> 29:44.675
And then what? We're right back
to where we started.

29:44.751 --> 29:47.586
Look, it's fine. The Mustang,
it's powerful enough, no problems there...

29:47.663 --> 29:50.305
...but there's no way I'm gonna continue
driving at the speeds we're going...

29:50.382 --> 29:53.914
- ...it's way too fucking dangerous.
- Okay, we'll talk to him then.

29:53.991 --> 29:56.701
To who, Leslie? Which one?

29:58.955 --> 30:01.278
Look, let's just sit here.

30:01.643 --> 30:04.924
Be patient. We'll figure it out soon enough.

30:19.561 --> 30:21.806
Two cheeseburgers.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.876
Oh, my God, he's leaving.

30:30.358 --> 30:32.120
Tell me when he's out the door.

30:38.052 --> 30:39.529
Now.

30:51.330 --> 30:52.916
It's not him.

31:01.601 --> 31:04.313
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

31:10.495 --> 31:13.393
- Okay.
- May I help you?

31:14.174 --> 31:15.792
Stop it.

31:17.022 --> 31:18.577
What?

31:19.037 --> 31:21.168
You know what I'm talking about.

31:21.916 --> 31:25.005
- No, I don't. I don't have a fucking clue.
- I'll call the police!

31:26.682 --> 31:28.718
Don't play dumb with me.

31:28.795 --> 31:32.647
You have been harassing us...
no, terrorizing us... long enough.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.843
Just leave us alone.

31:42.456 --> 31:46.610
- You got some serious issues, girl.
- Oh, I've got issues? I've got issues?

31:46.687 --> 31:48.155
Emily!

31:48.375 --> 31:51.976
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Stop him, he's gonna kill her!

31:53.212 --> 31:56.364
Let her go. You made your point,
what more can you do?

31:57.430 --> 31:59.819
- Oh, God.
- You're not doing it here.

32:00.565 --> 32:02.918
Just keep that crazy bitch away from me.

32:05.811 --> 32:08.039
- I think you two better go.
- Okay.

32:08.115 --> 32:10.055
Emily, what just got into you?

32:10.611 --> 32:12.517
You said I should get tougher.

32:12.594 --> 32:14.405
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

32:14.481 --> 32:16.642
Wait here, I'll get our stuff.

33:08.110 --> 33:10.246
Stop, you fucking coward!

33:23.922 --> 33:26.078
Show yourself, you coward!

33:30.506 --> 33:33.148
- Leslie.
- What?

34:55.049 --> 34:56.571
No.

35:00.152 --> 35:02.827
- Shit, there's no way.
- God, no.

35:02.903 --> 35:05.594
There's no way.
This is... this is impossible.

35:05.671 --> 35:09.399
Please don't let it be him. Please don't
let it be him. Please don't let it be him.

35:12.817 --> 35:15.139
Oh, my God. We need to loosen up.

35:26.882 --> 35:29.237
Holy fuck! Some actual courtesy.

35:33.041 --> 35:35.955
- That tow truck could learn from this guy.
- No kidding.

35:39.174 --> 35:41.042
Thanks, man.

35:41.119 --> 35:42.927
That's how it's done.

36:23.196 --> 36:24.959
This is crazy.

36:32.554 --> 36:33.876
Oh, God.

36:52.150 --> 36:54.538
That is the craziest thing I ever...

36:54.999 --> 36:56.970
- Where's the driver?
- There is no driver.

36:57.046 --> 36:58.890
- We've been having these problems...
- Back it up.

36:58.966 --> 37:02.248
Your car, back it up. We need to clear this
bridge before somebody else comes along.

37:02.325 --> 37:06.243
Park it over there by mine. You see
somebody else coming, you scream. Loud.

37:08.212 --> 37:10.009
Get in, I'll push.

37:21.138 --> 37:23.651
Hey, the steering wheel's locked!

37:24.524 --> 37:26.003
Look.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.145
See if it'll turn over first.

37:32.943 --> 37:35.328
It was worth a shot, anyway.

37:51.053 --> 37:53.995
- Park it. Hand brake!
- What?

37:55.947 --> 37:58.364
- Hand brake.
- I can't hear you.

38:04.635 --> 38:05.998
What?

38:06.507 --> 38:09.980
We're in luck. This tow truck driver
said he'll give us a hand.

38:25.064 --> 38:26.557
Damn.

38:27.785 --> 38:29.273
Damn.

38:48.135 --> 38:49.928
What are you playing at?

38:52.453 --> 38:54.199
Get in.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.294
Go. Go!

39:03.267 --> 39:05.046
What the fuck's going on? Who is that guy?

39:05.123 --> 39:08.238
If I were you, I would get out of here
before he tries to come for you too.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.668
Oh, my God.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.780
- Oh, God.
- He's coming!

39:33.857 --> 39:36.178
What do you fucking want from us?

39:41.056 --> 39:42.462
Fuck.

40:13.374 --> 40:15.123
All right.

40:15.679 --> 40:18.449
Yeah. Try to keep up at this speed, asshole.

40:26.749 --> 40:29.135
You're no match for this this fucking car.

40:52.281 --> 40:54.090
Oh, my God.

41:01.144 --> 41:02.957
Oh, my God!

41:03.417 --> 41:05.482
The doors! Lock the fucking doors!

41:26.261 --> 41:28.263
This is fucking insanity.

41:30.948 --> 41:32.662
Can you change a flat?

41:39.392 --> 41:41.156
Come on.

41:45.009 --> 41:46.466
Fuck!

41:47.248 --> 41:50.109
- How are you making out?
- This one's too tight.

41:50.185 --> 41:53.090
- Let me try.
- No, keep your eyes on the road.

41:53.167 --> 41:55.711
Come on, you little fucker. Come on!

41:57.645 --> 41:59.169
Yes!

41:59.246 --> 42:02.318
I did it! I actually did it!

42:04.779 --> 42:06.525
We gotta go.

42:14.761 --> 42:16.283
Run!

43:23.177 --> 43:24.635
Leslie!

44:04.870 --> 44:06.329
Leslie!

44:18.820 --> 44:22.860
Fucking asshole, don't you dare
fucking hurt her. Don't hurt her.

44:23.512 --> 44:25.880
Oh, come on! Give me some reception.

44:26.244 --> 44:29.302
Give me some fucking reception.
Please give me some reception.

44:39.362 --> 44:43.443
How much longer? How much longer?
Goddamn it, how much longer?

45:13.375 --> 45:15.314
Slow down. Slow down.

45:46.398 --> 45:50.447
Please do the right thing, please,
I am begging you. Please let her go.

45:55.228 --> 45:56.750
Leslie!

45:58.075 --> 45:59.822
Leslie, are you in there?

46:05.706 --> 46:07.228
Leslie!

46:14.185 --> 46:17.307
Please, I just want to know if she's safe.

46:24.217 --> 46:27.689
Wait! Don't go! I just want to...

46:30.582 --> 46:33.235
You son of a bitch, this isn't a game!

46:33.311 --> 46:36.552
Please! Son of a bitch,
this isn't a fucking game!

46:36.629 --> 46:39.014
I just want to know if she's safe!

46:51.283 --> 46:52.486
Fuck!

46:52.563 --> 46:56.709
I just want to know if she's safe,
you fucking asshole!

46:57.170 --> 46:58.627
Fuck!

47:40.557 --> 47:43.103
What? Oh, shit!

48:54.156 --> 48:56.136
That's it.

48:56.213 --> 48:58.365
Keep going, you fuckin' creep.

49:08.330 --> 49:11.259
Come on, please give me
some fucking reception.

49:25.544 --> 49:27.709
Something fucking work!

49:28.361 --> 49:29.914
Fuck!

49:32.743 --> 49:35.097
I cannot believe this.

49:44.422 --> 49:46.584
Hold it together, Emily.

50:00.477 --> 50:02.076
Fuck this.

50:05.283 --> 50:08.535
I'm gonna sit here and wait...

50:08.612 --> 50:10.953
...until it is safe to go for help.

50:32.577 --> 50:35.267
Open the fucking door, Emily! Open it!

50:37.569 --> 50:39.156
- You fucking bitch!
- What?

50:39.233 --> 50:41.522
- You left me there to die!
- No, I didn't!

50:41.599 --> 50:45.267
- I didn't! I swear I thought he took you!
- Bullshit! You left me with that monster!

50:45.344 --> 50:49.586
No! Please, please, believe me!
I swear! I'm sorry!

50:49.663 --> 50:51.407
I swear!

50:53.049 --> 50:54.798
I'm so sorry.

50:57.851 --> 50:59.309
Yeah.

51:00.346 --> 51:01.867
Leslie...

51:03.543 --> 51:05.516
...how did you get here so fast?

51:08.218 --> 51:10.069
I hitched a ride.

51:11.801 --> 51:13.547
With who?

51:17.400 --> 51:18.803
Who do you think?

52:32.853 --> 52:35.014
No, I... I gave you the road.

53:56.112 --> 53:57.601
What?

54:09.903 --> 54:14.248
Oh, my God! Oh, my fucking God!
Thank you, thank you, God. Thank you.

54:14.325 --> 54:17.665
Thank you, God. Thank God you're here.

54:18.173 --> 54:19.693
Thank you.

54:21.835 --> 54:25.054
Thank God you're here. Thank God.
I thought you were him. I honestly thought...

54:25.130 --> 54:27.764
Ma'am, please, I just need you
to get back in the car.

54:27.841 --> 54:29.565
What? No...

54:29.642 --> 54:32.763
Officer, I need help. I need help!

54:32.840 --> 54:34.972
Driver's license and registration, please.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.979
No, you don't understand.

54:38.055 --> 54:40.794
He took my friend and he is coming for me!

54:42.118 --> 54:44.313
Who? Who's coming for you?

54:44.908 --> 54:46.648
I don't know.

54:47.109 --> 54:50.069
He drives a tow truck
and he wants to kill me.

54:53.314 --> 54:55.125
He had to have passed you.

54:55.202 --> 54:57.237
He... he had to.

54:57.889 --> 55:00.660
No, someone is chasing me, Officer.

55:00.737 --> 55:02.291
I swear.

55:02.847 --> 55:05.168
Ma'am, please, just get back in the car.

55:10.046 --> 55:11.983
I just need you to get in the car.

55:26.809 --> 55:28.957
I know this sounds crazy.
It sounds fucking crazy to me too...

55:29.034 --> 55:31.307
Driver's license and registration, please.

55:32.792 --> 55:34.957
I am not making this up.

55:36.089 --> 55:37.610
I'm not.

55:40.407 --> 55:44.027
There was a tow truck.
The driver, he took my friend Leslie.

55:44.535 --> 55:47.306
He took my friend Leslie,
and I think he killed her.

55:47.382 --> 55:50.569
Certain he killed her. And now...
now he wants to kill me.

55:50.646 --> 55:53.518
He wants to kill me,
because I am the only witness.

55:53.595 --> 55:54.715
Where are my fucking papers?

55:54.792 --> 55:57.126
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to settle down.

55:59.572 --> 56:01.830
Sure. Sure, I'll settle down.

56:01.907 --> 56:03.877
I'm not making this up.

56:08.977 --> 56:10.627
Come on.

56:12.464 --> 56:15.012
Fuck, it's in here. Here!

56:15.856 --> 56:18.017
Yeah, here! Here they are.

56:43.310 --> 56:45.064
Oh, God.

57:07.274 --> 57:08.670
Here.

57:08.746 --> 57:10.269
Hello?

57:10.346 --> 57:11.997
Hello? Is anybody there?

57:12.073 --> 57:14.556
<i>This is police dispatch. Who am I talking to?</i>

57:14.633 --> 57:18.427
Oh, my God, thank you!
I need help! I need help, please!

57:18.504 --> 57:20.280
I need help.

57:20.870 --> 57:22.615
<i>Please respond, ma'am.</i>

57:28.707 --> 57:29.844
No.

59:21.306 --> 59:23.021
What the fuck?

01:00:18.422 --> 01:00:21.469
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
You gotta be fucking me.

01:00:21.546 --> 01:00:23.561
What the fuck do I do?

01:00:23.638 --> 01:00:25.990
Just go, just go.

01:00:53.491 --> 01:00:54.982
Okay.

01:00:55.634 --> 01:00:59.335
It's just us. It's just... us.

01:01:16.416 --> 01:01:17.764
I need gas. Quick.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.811
- Nah, we're closed.
- What?

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:22.022
Hey...

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:25.379
Look, ma'am, look, come on, I don't...
I don't want no trouble here.

01:01:25.455 --> 01:01:27.330
- Fill 'er up now!
- All right. All right.

01:01:27.407 --> 01:01:29.186
- Do you have a phone?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:29.263 --> 01:01:31.795
- Where?
- Over there. It's over there.

01:01:35.245 --> 01:01:37.825
Oh, thank God. Thank God, thank God.

01:01:37.902 --> 01:01:39.809
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

01:01:39.886 --> 01:01:41.298
Police, please.

01:01:46.283 --> 01:01:47.743
Yes.

01:01:48.299 --> 01:01:52.126
- Yes, I want to report a tow truck driving...
- <i>Can I have your name, ma'am?</i>

01:01:53.992 --> 01:01:57.212
He's taken my friend.
He killed a police officer.

01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:59.869
<i>Ma'am, can you calm down? I need your name.</i>

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:02.685
My name is Emily. Emily Kirk.

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:06.811
- <i>What is your address?</i>
- 1537 Jefferson Boulevard.

01:02:07.463 --> 01:02:09.242
Like "Captain."

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:11.865
I live in Seattle, Washington.

01:02:11.942 --> 01:02:15.607
<i>If you can just stay on the line, ma'am,
we need to verify some information.</i>

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.951
Oh, shit.

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:22.516
Oh, shit!

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.190
What the fuck is going on?

01:02:37.152 --> 01:02:39.153
That was my only phone!

01:03:18.558 --> 01:03:20.207
All right.

01:03:24.572 --> 01:03:27.088
If this is what we need to quit...

01:03:27.164 --> 01:03:29.135
...then bring it on.

01:03:29.691 --> 01:03:31.436
I'm ready now.

01:03:35.128 --> 01:03:36.952
Bring it on.

01:03:37.432 --> 01:03:40.362
Bring it on, bitch,
'cause I'm ready for you this time.

01:04:17.044 --> 01:04:18.568
No.

01:04:19.124 --> 01:04:20.647
No.

01:04:21.203 --> 01:04:23.524
No. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:04:35.217 --> 01:04:36.739
Damn.

01:04:43.376 --> 01:04:45.147
Oh, fuck!

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:58.754
Fuck!

01:05:05.195 --> 01:05:06.685
Shit!

01:06:25.352 --> 01:06:28.269
Where are you now? Where are you?

01:06:58.134 --> 01:06:59.382
What?

01:07:01.637 --> 01:07:03.767
Oh, my God. No. No more oil.

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.198
Okay.

01:07:37.906 --> 01:07:39.716
Come on.

01:07:53.233 --> 01:07:54.722
Okay.

01:08:02.096 --> 01:08:05.803
Oh, fuck! Fuck, come on. Just come on.

01:09:08.587 --> 01:09:10.323
You wanna play?

01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:12.778
Let's play.

01:10:21.575 --> 01:10:24.329
Fuck it. Got no choice.

01:10:40.006 --> 01:10:41.879
Come on.

01:11:26.979 --> 01:11:28.437
Leslie!

01:11:34.098 --> 01:11:35.555
Leslie?

01:11:52.031 --> 01:11:53.520
Leslie?

01:11:55.966 --> 01:11:57.710
Where is she?

01:11:59.099 --> 01:12:00.844
Where is she?

01:12:07.514 --> 01:12:09.244
Where is she?

01:13:03.283 --> 01:13:04.769
Hello?

01:13:37.165 --> 01:13:38.666
Oh, fuck!

01:13:44.139 --> 01:13:46.332
Please, Leslie, I'm sorry.

01:13:56.344 --> 01:13:58.145
I'm so sorry.

01:16:29.024 --> 01:16:30.545
Hello?

01:16:32.542 --> 01:16:34.352
Is anybody here?

01:16:40.861 --> 01:16:42.350
Hello?

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:45.709
My car is broken.

01:17:07.593 --> 01:17:09.788
I could use a little help here.
