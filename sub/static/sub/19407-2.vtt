18:08.586 --> 18:10.889
Um, hello!

18:10.922 --> 18:12.723
And how did that feel?
What's your reaction?

18:12.757 --> 18:13.758
I hear, like, a delay.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.292
Like, um...

18:15.326 --> 18:16.560
Yeah, it could be called an echo.

18:16.594 --> 18:17.828
- It's more like
a... - Mm-hmm.

18:17.862 --> 18:19.798
Like a reverb or something.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.332
Yup, that's very common.

18:21.365 --> 18:23.134
All right, Ivory.

18:23.167 --> 18:25.803
Hello.

18:25.836 --> 18:28.606
Hello. [laughs]

18:28.640 --> 18:30.609
It's almost like, you know,
when you watch a video,

18:30.642 --> 18:32.811
and it's just like... just
the tiniest bit out of sync

18:32.844 --> 18:34.479
so you just barely notice it?

18:34.511 --> 18:37.448
Mm-hmm. All right, Emma?

18:39.450 --> 18:41.786
Hello.

18:41.818 --> 18:43.754
Hello?

18:45.890 --> 18:47.526
Hello.

18:47.558 --> 18:48.726
Yeah, it is echoing,

18:48.759 --> 18:49.861
like you had a shot...

18:49.894 --> 18:51.429
like you had a shot of vodka.

18:51.461 --> 18:53.265
- [laughing]
- Something like that, like...

18:53.298 --> 18:55.901
Yeah, acute audio
distortion is really common.

18:55.933 --> 18:58.737
- Okay.<i>
- Here we see a classic example</i>

18:58.769 --> 19:00.238
<i>of conformity.</i>

19:00.270 --> 19:01.906
<i>But is she just trying to fit in</i>

19:01.940 --> 19:04.176
<i>or does she truly believe</i>

19:04.209 --> 19:06.644
<i>she's experiencing
side effects now?</i>

19:06.678 --> 19:08.680
- I'm feeling pretty chill.
- Ivory?

19:08.712 --> 19:10.615
I feel kind of, like, just relaxed.

19:10.647 --> 19:12.449
I just feel, like, really relaxed.

19:12.482 --> 19:15.519
<i>She's now claiming to feel
multiple side effects.</i>

19:15.553 --> 19:16.821
But yeah, no, it's like I...

19:16.854 --> 19:18.456
I had, like, two drinks or something.

19:18.489 --> 19:20.192
Right, and in this moment now,

19:20.224 --> 19:21.425
how do you feel?

19:21.459 --> 19:23.228
- Uh, kind of tired.
- Tired.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.528
- Right?
- Yeah.

19:24.561 --> 19:25.896
- Am I the only one?
- No. [laughs]

19:25.930 --> 19:29.601
Should go, like, nap
on that bean bag, yeah.

19:29.634 --> 19:31.269
<i>Emma continues to
look to the group</i>

19:31.301 --> 19:32.836
<i>for reassurance
that her symptoms</i>

19:32.869 --> 19:34.405
<i>are in line with theirs.</i>

19:34.439 --> 19:35.473
I don't know if I like it.

19:35.506 --> 19:36.541
I can't decide.

19:36.574 --> 19:37.909
You know what I mean?

19:37.942 --> 19:39.510
What do you guys think? I don't know.

19:39.544 --> 19:41.278
<i>Whatever she thinks
she's feeling,</i>

19:41.311 --> 19:43.615
<i>she wants to make sure
it fits in with the group.</i>

19:43.647 --> 19:45.282
The room is warmer, no?

19:45.316 --> 19:46.918
Yeah.

19:46.951 --> 19:50.654
Would you take this while you
were operating a motor vehicle?

19:50.688 --> 19:52.290
No, I don't think so.

19:52.323 --> 19:54.492
Because...

19:54.525 --> 19:57.329
'Cause you need to concentrate
on what you're doing.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.631
But I just feel so relaxed.

19:59.663 --> 20:02.701
<i>Here we see an entirely
new level of conformity.</i>

20:02.733 --> 20:04.769
<i>Our subject is
actually experiencing</i>

20:04.801 --> 20:07.938
<i>physical manifestations
due to group pressure.</i>

20:07.971 --> 20:11.675
<i>Other subjects also
experienced physical sensations</i>

20:11.709 --> 20:13.979
<i>that they reported
in great detail.</i>

20:14.011 --> 20:15.813
Hello.

20:15.846 --> 20:18.383
I hear the echo. I can hear the echo.

20:18.415 --> 20:19.783
So you know an echo
would go out, then in?

20:19.817 --> 20:21.620
This is, like, just an in.

20:21.653 --> 20:22.787
I just feel, like, sensation,

20:22.819 --> 20:25.022
like, near my eye and nose area.

20:25.056 --> 20:26.725
I feel like it's definitely
getting brighter, though.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.760
Okay, could you say more
about the increased brightness?

20:29.794 --> 20:32.430
It's not comfortable to
look at the lights, really.

20:32.462 --> 20:34.398
<i>What we're seeing
from these subjects</i>

20:34.432 --> 20:36.768
<i>could be a form of
informational conformity,</i>

20:36.800 --> 20:38.035
<i>or even what's called</i>

20:38.068 --> 20:39.336
<i>a contact high,</i>

20:39.369 --> 20:40.604
<i>a psychological phenomenon</i>

20:40.637 --> 20:41.905
<i>that occurs when a sober person</i>

20:41.939 --> 20:43.775
<i>comes into contact with someone</i>

20:43.807 --> 20:45.609
<i>who is under the
influence of drugs</i>

20:45.643 --> 20:49.480
<i>and begins to manifest
the same physical symptoms.</i>

20:49.513 --> 20:50.914
I can now debrief you

20:50.948 --> 20:52.917
on what has been going on.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.553
So none of you took anything

20:55.586 --> 20:57.021
but, uh, water today.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.690
What?

20:58.722 --> 21:01.358
[laughter]

21:01.392 --> 21:03.595
And we're just kind
of looking at the way

21:03.627 --> 21:05.529
that groups conform together.

21:05.563 --> 21:07.599
We wanted to see what it would take

21:07.632 --> 21:09.968
to get someone to fall
in line with the group.

21:10.999 --> 21:12.304
Did you feel actual changes,

21:12.336 --> 21:13.438
or were you saying some things

21:13.471 --> 21:14.772
just to fit in and not stick out?

21:14.806 --> 21:16.408
No, I felt relaxed, so I don't get...

21:16.441 --> 21:17.976
I can't figure it...
I still feel relaxed.

21:18.009 --> 21:19.510
Are you surprised to have heard

21:19.544 --> 21:21.780
that you just drank water?

21:21.813 --> 21:22.914
Yeah.

21:22.946 --> 21:25.582
I definitely feel different.

21:25.615 --> 21:27.685
I actually did hear, yeah, an echo.

21:27.719 --> 21:30.622
<i>The desire to conform is so strong,</i>

21:30.654 --> 21:32.490
<i>the subjects continue to believe</i>

21:32.522 --> 21:34.391
<i>in their manifested symptoms,</i>

21:34.424 --> 21:36.627
<i>even after learning
the drug was fake.</i>

21:36.661 --> 21:38.563
I am prone to anxiety attacks, though,

21:38.596 --> 21:40.097
so I felt relaxed.

21:40.131 --> 21:42.334
Well, you should take
more of this nothing.

21:42.366 --> 21:44.302
[laughter]

21:47.105 --> 21:50.442
Human society is incredibly complex.

21:50.474 --> 21:53.811
<i>And the dueling forces
pushing us to conform</i>

21:53.845 --> 21:56.714
<i>and also to express our individuality</i>

21:56.748 --> 21:58.516
<i>are both necessary.</i>

21:58.548 --> 22:01.819
<i>Other people can
influence us in good ways</i>

22:01.853 --> 22:04.022
<i>and in not-so-good ways.</i>

22:04.055 --> 22:05.490
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

22:05.522 --> 22:07.057
just remember this:

22:07.090 --> 22:10.061
what did the walrus say to the doctor?

22:11.596 --> 22:13.765
Give up?

22:13.798 --> 22:15.099
Cardboard.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.402
<i> [laughter]</i>

22:17.434 --> 22:19.403
Go ahead, laugh.

22:19.436 --> 22:21.105
Everyone's doing it.

22:21.138 --> 22:24.007
You don't want to look like
you don't get it, do you?

22:24.040 --> 22:25.643
Good, that's what I thought.

22:25.675 --> 22:26.977
Thanks for laughing,

22:27.010 --> 22:28.445
and as always,

22:28.479 --> 22:29.614
thanks for watching.
