WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:09.759
-[Sarah] Okay.
-[John B] We'll melt the bricks

00:09.843 --> 00:11.094
-so they're not traceable.
-Yeah.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.971
-We'll take it to the pawnshop...
-Mm-hm.

00:13.054 --> 00:15.056
...and after that,
we'll pay for JJ's restitution.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.767
-[Sarah] How many bars?
-[John B] I don't know. It was all muddy.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.562
-I think it was like 500.
-[Sarah] 500?

00:20.645 --> 00:23.148
-600.
-[Sarah] 600 bars of gold?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.858
[John B] I don't know.
Could be a thousand.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.526
It was all muddy, but it was everywhere.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.737
Covering the walls, stacks of it.

00:28.820 --> 00:32.115
Four hundred million dollars.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.659
-It's all there.
-[Sarah laughs] Hey, that's crazy!

00:34.743 --> 00:37.037
[John B] We did it.
Now we just have to get it out of there.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.705
[Sarah] Right. So how will we do that?

00:38.788 --> 00:40.665
-Okay, so, Pope has a plan...
-[Sarah] Uh-huh...

00:40.749 --> 00:42.667
...basically takes a pulley system...

00:45.503 --> 00:46.546
[Ward sighs]

00:49.841 --> 00:52.052
Kinda little in comparison
to 400 million dollars in gold.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.470
-Think about it--
-[Ward] Hey.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.180
-Hey.
-Hi!

00:56.306 --> 00:57.348
What are you two plotting?

00:57.432 --> 00:58.641
Uh...

00:58.725 --> 01:00.977
The... usual stuff.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.145
World domination.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.064
That's my girl, always aiming high.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.608
It's gonna have to wait a day, though,

01:08.276 --> 01:10.445
'cause I'm takin' this kid fishin'
tomorrow morning.

01:10.528 --> 01:11.362
First light.

01:12.697 --> 01:13.865
Um...

01:14.908 --> 01:15.825
Just you and me.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.203
No, he can't tomorrow.

01:19.037 --> 01:19.871
Why not? 

01:19.954 --> 01:21.748
Well, because we have plans.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.250
Oh, really? What plans are those?
Sit by the pool all day?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.669
-No.
-Look, that boat needs a first mate,

01:26.753 --> 01:29.422
and you need to start earning your keep
around here, all right?

01:30.632 --> 01:31.883
-Dad.
-What?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.344
Sweetie, I'm kidding.
He's new to the family.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.929
I wanna take him fishing. All right?

01:39.099 --> 01:39.933
Okay.

01:40.892 --> 01:41.768
Yeah?

01:45.146 --> 01:45.980
All right.

01:49.692 --> 01:50.652
It's gonna be good.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.081
[Kie] He said it looked
something like this.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.290
[Sarah] So...

02:04.874 --> 02:07.377
[Kie] That's 50 feet down,
and they're using 100-feet rope.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.587
So I guess this little wagon will go... 

02:09.671 --> 02:11.631
-[Sarah laughs]
-...straight to the gold room.

02:11.714 --> 02:12.841
Who drew this?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.260
Who do you think? [laughs]

02:17.679 --> 02:18.513
You wanna help?

02:19.222 --> 02:20.140
-Yeah.
-[John B] Great.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.392
We get this boat winch out,
bring it to the basement,

02:22.475 --> 02:23.393
drill into the floor.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.145
We lower you down
and get as much as we can.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.814
-And, uh... this time we don't drop you.
-That'd be great.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.315
[both chuckle]

02:29.399 --> 02:31.359
[JJ] Kie! This better work.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.487
We can't pawn this
if there's a giant wheat symbol on it.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.490
It's gonna work.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.308
Hell of a job melting it down,
Dr. Frankenstein.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.851
[Kie] Like you could've done better.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.060
I could have.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.312
-I took a welding class.
-You--

03:07.395 --> 03:08.813
-Whoa, whoa. Hey. Sh!
-When?

03:09.230 --> 03:10.356
Chill out, okay?

03:11.065 --> 03:14.235
Easy for you to say. You're not the one
that has to pawn this piece of shit off.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.904
How did I get this job anyway?

03:15.987 --> 03:17.197
'Cause you're the best liar.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.615
[shop bell rings]

03:18.948 --> 03:19.908
Afternoon, ma'am.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.284
Afternoon.

03:21.784 --> 03:22.994
[JJ] I see you buy gold.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.787
That's what the sign say, don't it?

03:24.871 --> 03:28.750
Well, I sure hope you buy a lot of it,
because I'm about to blow your mind.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.419
I ain't got much mind left to blow,
so have at it.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.338
[JJ] How about them gold apples?

03:34.505 --> 03:36.424
[chuckles] That ain't real.

03:36.507 --> 03:37.425
That ain't real?

03:37.508 --> 03:39.636
-[pawnbroker] It can't be.
-Feel how heavy it is.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.555
Mm-hm. Mm-hm!

03:43.181 --> 03:44.432
Let's get some light on that.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.686
Spray-painted tungsten.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.647
Spray-painted tungsten? Really? Okay.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.107
Why don't you see how, uh, soft it is?

03:53.191 --> 03:54.609
-You mind?
-No, go for it.

03:56.527 --> 03:59.489
-[JJ] Wow. Would you look at that?
-[pawnbroker] Hold your horses.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.908
We ain't got to the acid test yet.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.826
Ooh! The acid test.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.703
My favorite, guys.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.293
Well, it ain't plated,
and it ain't painted.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.879
Ma'am, I'm telling ya,
this is as real as the day is long.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.423
It looks like somebody
tried to melt it down.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.342
My mom.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.303
She had all this jewelry
laying around the house,

04:22.387 --> 04:24.847
and she thought it was best
to-- to melt it down.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.224
To "consolidate" it.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.310
[pawnbroker] Seven pounds?

04:29.394 --> 04:30.979
That's a lot of earrings.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.397
Okay, to be honest, ma'am,

04:33.022 --> 04:36.317
[clears throat] ...it's really hard
to see my mom fall apart with Alzheimer's.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.570
-[pawnbroker] Mm-hm.
-Alzheimer's?

04:39.654 --> 04:40.863
Give me a minute.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.115
Take your time, ma'am.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.368
[man on radio] <i>Good news...</i>

04:45.451 --> 04:46.911
Some kids just rolled in here

04:46.995 --> 04:49.122
with the biggest gold nugget
I have ever seen.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.665
Almost seven pounds.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.292
[Barry] You mean seven ounces?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.585
[pawnbroker] I mean seven pounds.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.759
[whispering] ...she's coming out...

05:01.843 --> 05:03.219
So, I, uh...

05:03.303 --> 05:04.554
[clears throat]

05:04.637 --> 05:06.180
I talked to my boss.

05:06.264 --> 05:09.350
-[JJ] And?
-And, uh, this is what I can do.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.271
Fifty thousand?

05:13.813 --> 05:16.274
You think I walked in here
not knowin' the spot price?

05:16.357 --> 05:19.736
Ma'am, I know for a fact
this is worth 140, at least.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.571
Well, sweetie, you in a pawnshop.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.239
This ain't Zurich.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.074
Do I look Swiss to you?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.993
Ninety, or I walk.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.704
Seventy. Half price...

05:30.163 --> 05:31.247
and, um...

05:32.332 --> 05:35.585
[quietly] ...I don't ask questions
about where you got this.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.176
I'm gonna need that
in large denominations, please.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.182
Well, here's the snag.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.768
I don't have that much denominated,
not here anyway.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.186
I can write you a cashier's check.

05:53.269 --> 05:56.272
Cash... No, ma'am. I want the cold hard.
That's what that sign says.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.816
Cash for gold. And that's what I expect.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.651
I'm gonna get it in cold hard.

06:00.735 --> 06:05.490
Well, I have to send you to the warehouse.
I have the money there. Is that all right?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.911
Where's this warehouse?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.705
[reggae music playing on car stereo]

06:17.210 --> 06:19.504
So they keep money out here?

06:19.587 --> 06:20.671
[JJ] That's what she said.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.799
-[chuckles] That's what she said.
-Stop.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.802
I've never even heard
of Resurrection Drive.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.929
-'Cause you're rich.
-You've never heard of it either.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.055
Thank you.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.808
[Kie] There's nothing but weeds back here.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.353
All right, just 'cause it's just weeds,
doesn't mean it's, like...

06:35.436 --> 06:37.605
-[siren whoops]
-[Kie] Cops? Out here?

06:37.688 --> 06:40.733
-God! Are you kidding me?
-What did we do?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.568
-Why are we getting pulled over?
-Stash that.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.820
-Chill, guys.
-Put it--

06:43.903 --> 06:45.613
-I hate cops.
-Did you bring the gun?

06:45.696 --> 06:46.823
[JJ] No. Okay?

06:46.906 --> 06:48.741
Everybody told me
to leave it back at the place.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.659
Thank God.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.577
-Okay...
-Please, everything else in your bag.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.037
-I am! I am, all right?
-Oh, oh--

06:53.121 --> 06:54.914
[Kie] How much weed
do you have on you, bro?

06:54.997 --> 06:57.333
-[Pope] He's walking up.
-[John B] Nothing better to do--

06:57.417 --> 06:58.835
-Sir--
-[cocks gun]

07:00.169 --> 07:02.422
[Barry] Why don't I go ahead
and see them hands in the air?

07:03.881 --> 07:05.508
All y'all's hands up in the air now!

07:05.591 --> 07:06.801
You, out of the car! Let's go!

07:10.096 --> 07:11.597
Out of the car! Let's go! Hurry!

07:12.265 --> 07:13.266
Let them out!

07:14.934 --> 07:17.728
What are you waitin' on?
What are you waitin' on? Let them out!

07:17.812 --> 07:19.439
-[whimpers]
-[Barry] All y'all!

07:19.897 --> 07:22.567
Go on! Go on!
Let's get out the car! Let's go!

07:23.067 --> 07:26.320
There you go, pretty girl. Here we go!
Get out the car, let's go! Hurry up!

07:26.404 --> 07:27.238
There you go!

07:27.321 --> 07:28.906
-We're broke--
-[Barry] Shut the hell up!

07:28.990 --> 07:31.284
-All right! Just relax!
-[Barry] Shut the hell up! Shut up!

07:31.367 --> 07:33.244
-[JJ] Chill!
-[Barry] Blow your damn head off!

07:33.327 --> 07:35.663
Lay down in the ditch!
Lay down in the ditch!

07:35.746 --> 07:37.790
On your goddamn hands and knees! Down!

07:37.874 --> 07:39.125
Put your face on the ground!

07:39.208 --> 07:41.294
Stay here just like that!
Put your head down!

07:41.711 --> 07:44.088
Don't let me see you look up! All right?

07:44.714 --> 07:46.048
That's all y'all gotta do.

07:53.764 --> 07:54.765
It's a setup, guys.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.350
That old bat shanked us.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.352
Fuck! Goddamn it!

08:03.274 --> 08:04.859
Wait. No, no, no, no.

-Don't be a hero, man.
-Sh.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.551

08:30.635 --> 08:32.303
[Barry] All right, y'all stay like that.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.223
Unless you want your brains blown out
all over this road,

08:35.306 --> 08:37.475
don't move your goddamn heads, okay?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.977
[whimpers]

[both grunting]

08:52.823 --> 08:54.575

-I got the gold!
-[Sarah shrieks]

09:06.337 --> 09:07.547
You son of a bitch!

09:07.630 --> 09:09.632
[panting]

09:10.049 --> 09:11.425
I know this piece of shit!

09:11.509 --> 09:13.386
-He's a basehead!
-Probably knows my brother.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.637
He sells coke to my dad.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.181
Listen, I couldn't hurt
any single one of y'all--

09:17.265 --> 09:18.766
-[Kie] JJ!
-[Pope] Dude, chill, man.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.685
-Come on.
-[Barry wheezing]

09:20.768 --> 09:22.311
[John B] Come on, let's get outta here.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.854
[Barry coughing]

09:26.190 --> 09:27.650
We got one last stop.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.360
[John B] Hey!

09:29.443 --> 09:31.946
[JJ] Let's go see
where this son of a bitch lives.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.156
[Barry] I'm gonna remember this shit!

09:35.324 --> 09:37.868
-You can't hide from me!
-[engine starts]

09:37.952 --> 09:39.870
I know exactly who y'all are!

09:40.413 --> 09:41.872
Huh? You're gonna see me again!

09:42.582 --> 09:43.958
-You hear me?
-[keys jangle]

09:44.041 --> 09:45.418
-[JJ] Come on!
-[Barry] You hear me?

09:45.501 --> 09:46.836
I'mma see you again!

09:49.130 --> 09:51.132
[loon calling]

09:51.716 --> 09:55.803
-[Sarah] Welcome to Crackhead Wasteland.
-[Pope] I don't know about this, man.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.851
Dude, why are we at Barry's?

10:03.060 --> 10:04.437
[JJ] This'll only take a second.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.980
[dog barking]

10:10.776 --> 10:13.863
-[John B] Where you going?
-<i>Yo soy justicia.</i>

10:15.656 --> 10:17.325
Did you glean anything from that?

10:17.408 --> 10:19.410
-You know somebody should probably--
-Yeah, I got it.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.453
-Right.
-[sighs]

10:23.080 --> 10:25.374
[JJ] I know you got a stash
around here somewhere.

26:06.731 --> 26:07.857
Why do I get the feeling

26:07.941 --> 26:10.026
I'm not the first girl
you've brought here?

26:10.443 --> 26:14.072
You think I bring all my random hookups
to my secret spot?

26:14.531 --> 26:17.242
I don't know what you do
with your random hookups.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.836
So, this is gonna sound really morbid,

26:30.088 --> 26:31.756
but today was a lot of fun.

When I get to this point...

27:16.426 --> 27:20.055
usually, with boys, I... bail.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.186
Maybe we should stop?

-Okay.
-[John B] Hey...

-No.

28:12.732 --> 28:13.650
I haven't.

28:17.153 --> 28:18.571
Does that freak you out?

28:22.367 --> 28:23.993
No, actually.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.831
I mean, it's not like
there haven't been chances--

28:27.914 --> 28:30.333

I'm sure you've had plenty of chances.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.336

28:34.754 --> 28:37.006

28:39.134 --> 28:40.635
but when that moment comes--

28:40.719 --> 28:42.762
-Think you're gonna lose control?
-[Sarah] No.

28:42.846 --> 28:46.516
I guess I'm afraid
that you'll see who I am.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.771
And that you won't like it.

28:55.442 --> 28:56.943
You gettin' ready to bail now?

28:57.026 --> 28:58.236
Is that what's going on?

28:58.653 --> 29:01.406
You just gonna take off
and leave me here in the bell tower?

29:01.489 --> 29:02.949
[chuckles] You never know.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.367
Preemptive strike.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.454
I like the strategy. Hit hard, hit first.

[Sarah] Gotta keep you on your toes.

29:09.038 --> 29:11.416
-[John B] I guess so.
-[Sarah] What about you?

29:11.499 --> 29:14.002
Was it special for you?

29:15.503 --> 29:20.925

it was super special, yeah.

-Straight shooter.
-[John B] Yeah.

29:33.772 --> 29:39.611
And, uh... so we went back to her condo,
and it lasted a total of 25 seconds.

And then you and JJ high-fived.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.639
Just get in!

33:37.265 --> 33:39.267
[both sobbing]

33:40.143 --> 33:41.310
I just couldn't do it.

33:48.651 --> 33:50.445
I can't take him anymore!

33:52.697 --> 33:54.073
I was gonna kill him.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.087
I just wanna do the right thing.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.005
[Kie] I know.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.381
I know.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.301
[cicadas chirping]

34:16.596 --> 34:18.598
[alarm beeping]

34:24.645 --> 34:26.647
[phone alarm chiming]

34:46.292 --> 34:47.210
Hi.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.006
Hi.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.555
-Bye.
-Bye.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.409
[seabirds calling]

35:23.246 --> 35:25.289
-[John B] Mornin', boss.
-[Ward] Yes, it is.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.707
Look at you, already hard at work.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.251
-[John B] Ah...
-[Ward] I like it!

35:28.668 --> 35:30.044
-Are you ready?
-[John B] Yeah.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.339
-[grunts] Yeah.
-You got it? All right, big man.

35:33.422 --> 35:36.008
Guffy said he got into it pretty good
just north of Big Rock.

35:36.092 --> 35:36.926
[Ward] Guffy, huh?

35:38.761 --> 35:41.097
With the mouth on him,
there'll be 15 boats up there already.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.808
I say we go south.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.602
Swansboro Hole.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.604
It'll be just you and me down there.

35:49.897 --> 35:50.731
Sound good?

35:51.315 --> 35:52.191
Yeah, yeah.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.484
All right, let's do it!

35:55.403 --> 35:56.362
Let's do it.

35:58.865 --> 36:02.201
-[Ward] We picked a good one, didn't we?
-[John B] Sure did.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.254
Hit me again.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.383
Ah... You know what?
Hold the grapefruit juice on this one.

36:18.509 --> 36:19.719
Let's get this day on its feet.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.889
In fact, you know what? Pour yourself one.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.268
I'm, uh... I'm-- I'm 16, sir. [chuckles]

36:27.351 --> 36:30.897
[Ward] John, I know you're 16, okay?
It's okay. It's just one drink.

36:30.980 --> 36:34.317
We're out here in the ocean.
These are almost international waters.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.195
-We're celebrating. Just one.
-All right, all right.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.404
-Yes, sir.
-[Ward] All right.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.573
See, here's the thing.
I don't know if you know this,

36:40.656 --> 36:44.660
but you're about to be fishing
with a Grand Knight of the Rhododendron.

36:45.161 --> 36:46.537
I know you don't know what that is,

36:46.621 --> 36:48.706
and it doesn't seem
like a big deal, but...

36:48.789 --> 36:49.999
to me, it is, it means I'm a...

36:50.416 --> 36:52.376
I'm a trusted member of this community.

36:53.127 --> 36:55.254
That means a lot to me. Trust.

36:56.547 --> 36:57.548
Absolutely, yeah.

36:58.382 --> 36:59.717
Here's to trust, John B.

37:01.385 --> 37:02.345
To trust.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.103
-Whew...
-[Ward laughs]

37:11.729 --> 37:13.272
-You okay?
-Yeah. No, I'm-- I'm--

37:13.356 --> 37:14.190
Yeah.

37:14.273 --> 37:16.692
Wait, I got one more. One more, I promise.

37:19.153 --> 37:21.030
I hear your girlfriend's pretty nice.

37:25.451 --> 37:26.285
To Sarah.

37:27.536 --> 37:28.496
To Sarah.

37:55.231 --> 37:56.148
[Ward] Anything?

37:56.732 --> 37:57.608
[John B] Nothin'.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.778
[Ward] Whew!

38:00.861 --> 38:03.197
Three hours trawling, one hour out here.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.657
We're getting skunked, son.

38:05.199 --> 38:06.325
Not a damn fish.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.453
I guess Guffy was right, huh?

38:10.037 --> 38:13.457
You know, half the time
I don't even care if I find fish.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.043
Just like bein' out here.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.379
That's what my dad used to say.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.968
John B, I wanna be real honest with you
right now.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.721
I'm gonna ask you to do the same for me.

38:27.722 --> 38:28.889
-Okay.
-[Ward] Yeah?

38:28.973 --> 38:30.266
-Yeah. Yeah.
-All right.

38:32.768 --> 38:35.229
First thing I have to do
is apologize to you.

38:35.980 --> 38:36.856
For what?

38:38.524 --> 38:40.860
I told you to stop lookin'
for the Royal Merchant gold.

38:42.194 --> 38:43.070
And you didn't.

38:44.196 --> 38:47.074
[chuckles] God damn it, you found it.

38:49.827 --> 38:50.745
I wish.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.497
[both chuckle]

38:55.541 --> 38:56.709
[John B clears throat]

38:58.210 --> 39:00.588
You can play it that way if you want.
I won't force your hand.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.633
But I know that you did.

39:05.301 --> 39:06.927
-[chuckles]
-[whispers] Yeah...

39:08.471 --> 39:10.973
And it's amazing.
Sincerely, it's unbelievable.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.309
[laughs]

39:13.392 --> 39:15.561
150 years, people been lookin'
for that goddamn gold.

39:15.644 --> 39:17.521
None of 'em could find it. You found it.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.817
Here's the thing, son. Finding it?

39:22.234 --> 39:23.819
That's where your fun ends.

39:24.403 --> 39:26.280
That's where all your problems begin.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.491
Ones you haven't even thought of.
I mean, excavating it.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.202
You're probably trying now.
If it's in water, how do you get it up?

39:31.285 --> 39:34.288
If it's on land, on somebody's property,
and they catch you trying to take it?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.664
That's theft.

39:36.123 --> 39:39.335
Jesus, son, we are talkin'
a massive amount of gold, John.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.295
You're 16.
How are you gonna transport that gold?

39:41.379 --> 39:43.756
How are you gonna turn it
into something in your bank account,

39:43.839 --> 39:44.882
something you can spend?

39:44.965 --> 39:48.052
See what I'm saying? See the difficulties?
This is what I'm talking about.

39:48.135 --> 39:51.055
The real truth,
the hard truth is that, John, right now...

39:52.932 --> 39:54.308
you are way over your head.

39:59.146 --> 40:00.064
You need me.

40:03.275 --> 40:04.443
Let's do this together.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.697
I can make all those problems go away.
That's my job.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.908
You and I will figure out
an equitable split.

40:11.575 --> 40:14.620
I know you didn't do this on your own,
that you have friends that helped you,

40:14.703 --> 40:15.621
so we cut them in.

40:16.747 --> 40:19.834
Don't be so nervous. It's okay, all right?
I'm just here to help you.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.044
All you gotta do is trust me.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.173
What do you say?

40:28.801 --> 40:29.760
Wanna do this?

40:33.055 --> 40:34.723
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.356
Okay. Okay, John.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.820
Okay. All right, all right.
We can play it that way.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.989
I think very quickly
you'll come to realize

40:50.072 --> 40:53.242
there's really no other choice.
I mean, I know, right?

40:53.325 --> 40:54.994
I know that you have it.

40:55.077 --> 40:57.163
I know that you've had
a little taste of it.

40:57.246 --> 41:00.291
I know a submersible went missing
from the salvage yard, right?

41:00.374 --> 41:02.460
I know maybe that's
how you got it out of the water.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.336
If it's on land,
I know that you've been all...

41:04.420 --> 41:06.964
all around the Eight recently, okay?

41:07.047 --> 41:08.883
I know maybe it's something to do
with Redfield.

41:08.966 --> 41:10.509
I know you asked
for the map from Sarah,

41:10.593 --> 41:12.052
so I gave you the map from Tannyhill.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.681
-What did you just say?
-I know-- The map of Tannyhill.

41:15.764 --> 41:18.267
[John B] What-- what did you just say?
The other thing.

41:21.562 --> 41:22.980
This was my father's.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.191
[Kie] What's Redfield?

41:31.280 --> 41:33.032
How do you know about Redfield?

41:35.910 --> 41:36.952
[chuckles]

41:37.036 --> 41:39.413
Unless you have my father's compass.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.833
-Um-- I don't--
-[John B] And if you have the compass,

41:42.917 --> 41:44.835
then you knew to search for it, right?

41:45.669 --> 41:47.838
-Do you hear how crazy you're being?
-[John B] Yes, yes.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.632
-I'm listening!
-[Ward] You sound crazy.

41:49.715 --> 41:52.051
Redfield! You said Redfield, did you not?

41:53.385 --> 41:57.264
"Redfield" was the last message
my father left before he disappeared.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.187
You know about his disappearance,
don't you?

42:05.231 --> 42:07.733
Don't-- don't--
don't fucking lie to me, Ward.

42:07.816 --> 42:08.984
I can see that you do.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.364
Let's see what the sheriff
has to say about this.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.410
Goin' home.

43:19.221 --> 43:20.180
[clangs loudly]

43:24.935 --> 43:26.854
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]
