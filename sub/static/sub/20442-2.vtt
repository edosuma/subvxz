WEBVTT

00:00.013 --> 00:02.248
<i>- Previously on</i> Good Witch.
- I've been hearing

00:02.273 --> 00:04.707
all of this talk
about some rare plant here.

00:04.743 --> 00:06.876
- The Middleton Merriwick.
- Malabathrum.

00:06.911 --> 00:09.045
For those days when nothing
seems to be going right.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.615
- Cassie, are you alright?
- Is something wrong?

00:12.651 --> 00:13.812
I don't know.

00:20.325 --> 00:23.092
The Merriwick looks like it's
trying to bloom, even though

00:23.128 --> 00:25.094
it must be hurting all
the way down to its roots.

00:25.130 --> 00:27.964
It's this whole town that's
hurting. Everyone was so excited

00:27.999 --> 00:30.533
to see this plant's flower; now
I don't know if we ever will!

00:30.568 --> 00:32.735
We're doing everything
we can to make it healthy.

00:32.771 --> 00:35.405
Yes, well, I need it to be
healthy now. I've already

00:35.440 --> 00:37.740
invited the tourism committee
to come here and see it

00:37.776 --> 00:39.976
so they'll put it
on the cover of their book!

00:40.011 --> 00:42.111
I decided that's what you would do.

00:42.147 --> 00:44.458
You know, believe in the best
and then, hope that it happens.

00:44.482 --> 00:46.746
- A solid course of action.
- Yes, but now

00:46.771 --> 00:48.418
I actually have to deliver, so...

00:48.453 --> 00:51.954
come on, Merriwick, don't let
this optimistic mayor down!

00:51.990 --> 00:54.157
Oh. I didn't realize you'd all be here.

00:54.192 --> 00:56.993
The Merriwick is the heart
and soul of our community.

00:57.028 --> 00:59.162
We all want to see it
back to full strength

00:59.197 --> 01:01.397
- as quickly as possible.
- That's right. She's one

01:01.433 --> 01:03.374
of our most prized possessions.

01:04.468 --> 01:06.350
It really is struggling.

01:07.305 --> 01:10.073
- What's in the soil?
- It's, uh...

01:10.108 --> 01:13.109
egg shells and coffee grounds.
I brought some things from Grey House.

01:13.144 --> 01:15.978
I'm using the best fertilizer I know of.

01:16.014 --> 01:18.081
Well, keep at it. I have
to get back to city hall

01:18.116 --> 01:20.294
and find out where Chief Sanders
is in his investigation.

01:20.318 --> 01:22.085
But in the meantime,

01:22.120 --> 01:25.421
stay strong. And believe!

01:33.244 --> 01:35.711
- Cassie!
- Hello, Sam!

01:35.746 --> 01:37.624
Trying to catch you since
I saw you on the corner.

01:37.648 --> 01:39.215
Well, I'm glad you finally did.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.395
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat
before I go to the hospital.

01:41.419 --> 01:43.319
- Are you hungry?
- Oh, I just ate.

01:43.354 --> 01:47.122
- Well, you could watch me eat.
- I can make time for that, yeah.

01:47.158 --> 01:52.228
Hey! Can we talk about
this little problem?

01:52.263 --> 01:54.730
Of course.

01:54.765 --> 01:57.299
I should probably
get back to work, then.

01:57.335 --> 01:59.268
Well, I can eat without an audience.

01:59.303 --> 02:01.237
- Hm! I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

02:07.411 --> 02:10.079
So this is the stuff
that made Ben's back

02:10.114 --> 02:11.925
- break out in hives.
- I still don't understand

02:11.949 --> 02:13.927
- how that could have happened.
- I know. I told him everything

02:13.951 --> 02:15.818
you've ever gave me worked amazing.

02:15.853 --> 02:18.065
Well, let's exchange that
for something that works now.

02:18.089 --> 02:20.267
Well, that's why you have the
best customer service in town.

02:20.291 --> 02:23.993
Hm...

02:25.630 --> 02:27.429
Uh...

02:30.067 --> 02:32.067
Here. Give him this.

02:32.103 --> 02:34.069
And this will help
with his sore muscles?

02:34.105 --> 02:36.272
Ask if it's something he'd like to try.

02:36.307 --> 02:38.974
- I will. Thanks.
- OK.

02:41.479 --> 02:45.314
- Abigail!
- Hey!

02:45.349 --> 02:48.250
- Hi!
- Ah, I'm completely

02:48.286 --> 02:51.020
out of vases at my store and
I thought maybe you had a few.

02:51.055 --> 02:53.289
- I do, except...
- I like this one.

02:53.324 --> 02:56.325
- Ooh...
- Oh...

02:56.360 --> 02:58.147
Whoops!

03:00.742 --> 03:02.364
Isn't that the Grey Lady?

03:02.400 --> 03:04.867
Slightly damaged, but yes.

03:04.902 --> 03:08.671
Well, I broke it, I'll fix it. And I'll
take as many of these as you can spare.

03:08.706 --> 03:10.673
Oh, except those vases are decorative

03:10.708 --> 03:13.709
for dry flowers, only.
They don't really hold water.

03:13.744 --> 03:18.113
- So you don't have what I need?
- Doesn't look like I do.

03:18.149 --> 03:21.717
- Hi.
- Grace. How was school?

03:21.752 --> 03:24.320
Horrible. There was
a pop quiz in calculus

03:24.355 --> 03:27.356
- that I did not see coming.
- Isn't that the point

03:27.391 --> 03:30.626
- of a pop quiz?
- Well, yeah,

03:30.661 --> 03:32.728
but usually I can tell
when they're about

03:32.763 --> 03:35.230
to happen and I always review,

03:35.266 --> 03:37.299
except this time, I didn't

03:37.335 --> 03:40.336
and if I failed that thing,
they might take me out of AP!

03:40.371 --> 03:42.571
They wouldn't do that
to a Merriwick girl.

03:42.607 --> 03:45.341
Except the Merriwick girls
don't seem to be operating

03:45.376 --> 03:46.836
at full Merriwick.

<i>Wow. What a beautiful place.</i>

04:15.068 --> 04:19.204
Thank you. We are fortunate
to call Grey House home.

04:19.238 --> 04:21.706
What brings you to Middleton?

04:21.741 --> 04:23.575
Visiting an old friend.

04:23.610 --> 04:25.428
Ah, the best kind of journeys.

04:25.464 --> 04:28.751
Yeah. I've been looking forward to this
trip since I booked it a couple of week ago.

04:28.775 --> 04:31.543
Well, I have your room
all ready for you.

04:31.578 --> 04:34.212
It is upstairs, second
door on the right.

04:34.247 --> 04:36.392
Breakfast is be in the dining
room and just let me know

04:36.416 --> 04:38.717
- if there's anything you need.
- You know,

04:38.752 --> 04:41.519
I can already tell I'm going
to love it here. Thanks.

04:58.605 --> 05:01.239
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Sorry. Still bothering you?

05:01.274 --> 05:03.975
- Uh, night and day.
- It's really inflamed.

05:04.011 --> 05:05.744
I thought that steroid
shot we did last week

05:05.779 --> 05:08.747
- would bring that down.
- Well, you did say that stuff

05:08.782 --> 05:10.081
didn't always work.

05:10.117 --> 05:12.217
Well, stay off it 'til we get it right.

05:12.252 --> 05:14.586
Ah, I appreciate that, thank you, Doc.

05:14.621 --> 05:16.421
OK. I'm going to...

05:16.456 --> 05:18.623
recommend two things.

05:18.658 --> 05:20.284
First...

05:21.076 --> 05:24.129
here's a prescription
for an anti-inflammatory

05:24.164 --> 05:25.728
to bring the swelling
down in your meniscus.

05:25.752 --> 05:27.098
Alright, and second?

05:27.134 --> 05:30.468
As your doctor, I'm ordering
you to stay off of trampolines.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.604
That I can do.

05:37.377 --> 05:39.744
Have you narrowed things
down to a list of suspects?

05:39.780 --> 05:42.781
Not yet. But this definitely
wasn't an accident.

05:42.816 --> 05:45.417
That stalk was cut,

05:45.452 --> 05:47.419
not broken. Looks like with shears,

05:47.454 --> 05:49.421
because the slice is pretty clean.

05:49.456 --> 05:52.457
It's like whoever did this
was attacking the entire town!

05:52.492 --> 05:54.793
Well, I spoke to everybody
who works at the Gardens

05:54.828 --> 05:56.761
and nobody saw anything.

05:56.797 --> 05:58.307
I was also hoping to get
a little bit of information

05:58.331 --> 06:00.865
out of this. Grace Russell's camera.

06:00.901 --> 06:02.834
She told me she was
taking photos the morning

06:02.869 --> 06:05.637
- the Merriwick was cut.
- Yeah. Except we can't

06:05.672 --> 06:07.505
get the power to come on.
So I took it down

06:07.541 --> 06:09.427
to an electronics store,
the guy looked at it and he said

06:09.462 --> 06:11.876
it was fine, should be working. Nope.

06:11.912 --> 06:14.279
Ah! Honestly, all this high-tech stuff!

06:14.314 --> 06:15.608
I ask you, what is the point?

06:15.644 --> 06:17.404
I'll have her come pick
this up when she can.

06:17.429 --> 06:18.828
Well, this room is all yours

06:18.852 --> 06:21.352
- as you gather more evidence.
- I'll keep at it,

06:21.388 --> 06:23.399
- just like you asked.
- Which means that I can devote

06:23.423 --> 06:26.124
more of my time to writing the
blurb that's going to appear

06:26.159 --> 06:28.094
in the state's tourism book
when the Merriwick is featured

06:28.114 --> 06:31.649
on the cover. Not looking
like that, of course, but...

06:31.684 --> 06:33.985
when the plant is actually in bloom.

06:34.020 --> 06:37.154
- And you're confident it will?
- Well, I'm hoping,

06:37.190 --> 06:39.257
which is all we can do.

06:49.135 --> 06:52.103
Oh, hey, I have something for you.

06:52.138 --> 06:54.639
It's not just that, but
I thought I'd start with that.

06:54.674 --> 06:57.174
Then we're off to a good start!

06:57.210 --> 06:59.050
Cassie wanted to say that she was

06:59.078 --> 07:00.756
really sorry about what
she gave you, but she is

07:00.780 --> 07:03.347
pretty sure this will work better.

07:03.383 --> 07:05.249
- Pretty sure?
- <i>If</i> you want to try it.

07:05.285 --> 07:07.318
Yeah, I think I'll stick
with what I can get

07:07.353 --> 07:10.454
- from the regular old drugstore.
- I guess I can understand that.

07:10.490 --> 07:13.791
But wait till you hear what
happened on my way back there.

07:13.826 --> 07:15.866
I went past the old Middleton
theater and there were

07:15.895 --> 07:18.029
these two guys I did
construction for heading inside.

07:18.064 --> 07:20.431
Yeah, except that theater
has been closed for years.

07:20.466 --> 07:23.593
It's for sale. They're looking

07:23.628 --> 07:25.770
to buy the place and fix it up.

07:25.805 --> 07:27.572
Movies at the Middleton theater again?

07:27.607 --> 07:28.979
That's a great idea.

07:29.004 --> 07:30.808
And they want me to invest
in it with them.

07:31.511 --> 07:33.311
- That would be perfect for you.
- Right?

07:33.346 --> 07:35.580
If I could get in there and
restore some of the frescos

07:35.615 --> 07:37.311
and the old architecture...

07:37.336 --> 07:38.628
You could make it look amazing.

07:38.663 --> 07:40.885
And it would actually
be something of mine.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.321
- Yeah!
- Did I hear you say

07:43.356 --> 07:45.529
you were going to re-open
the Middleton theater?

07:45.553 --> 07:47.411
Yeah, but first I have to come up

07:47.446 --> 07:49.754
- with the money to buy into it.
- You've got connections,

07:49.778 --> 07:52.296
- and lots of money saved. - Right now
I don't have enough of either one.

07:52.332 --> 07:54.799
Well, why don't you just
ask the local business-owner

07:54.834 --> 07:57.335
that you're dating to help you out?

07:57.370 --> 07:59.337
What?

07:59.372 --> 08:01.238
Business is good.

08:01.274 --> 08:03.908
I'm sure Stephanie
can spare a few dollars.

08:03.943 --> 08:05.921
I'm not going to ask my
girlfriend for money. I mean,

08:05.945 --> 08:08.312
that would be...

08:08.348 --> 08:11.349
- weird.
- Oh.

08:13.519 --> 08:15.145
Sorry I brought it up.

08:27.644 --> 08:29.323
Thank you for dinner.

08:29.358 --> 08:31.369
Well, I hope you don't mind
it was delivered in a box

08:31.404 --> 08:33.371
instead of coming out of an oven.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.072
Well, I always love Persian food.

08:35.107 --> 08:37.763
- We had pizza.
- Which some say

08:37.798 --> 08:41.846
was invented by King Darius's
armies more than 2000 years ago.

08:41.881 --> 08:43.592
Is that even true
or did you just make it up?

08:43.616 --> 08:46.417
I never lie about food.

08:46.452 --> 08:48.452
Oh. I didn't mean to interrupt.

08:48.488 --> 08:52.423
- Oh! No, no. Come on in. Sam, this is Kevin.
- Nice to meet you.

08:52.458 --> 08:54.392
- You as well.
- Sam is a doctor here in town.

08:54.427 --> 08:56.394
- Where are you from?
- New York.

08:56.429 --> 08:59.230
- That's where I'm from.
- I work in advertising there.

08:59.265 --> 09:01.379
Kevin?

09:02.835 --> 09:06.404
- Abigail.
- What is he doing here?

09:06.439 --> 09:09.046
He's a guest.

09:09.942 --> 09:12.543
- I was hoping we could talk.
- I have nothing more

09:12.578 --> 09:15.913
to say to you. Ever.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.130
Are you ready for any pop quizzes

09:33.166 --> 09:35.433
- that might surprise you today?
- I am

09:35.468 --> 09:37.168
and I reviewed again, just in case.

09:37.203 --> 09:39.170
It's always good to be
prepared, just in case.

09:39.205 --> 09:41.839
- Good morning, Daphne.
- Hi. I was just

09:41.874 --> 09:43.974
admiring the plants
in your beautiful garden.

09:44.010 --> 09:46.277
Grace and I love to work
together back there.

09:46.312 --> 09:49.413
Except <i> she</i> plants things
a little too close together.

09:49.449 --> 09:51.849
I like them to be able
to feed off of their proximity

09:51.884 --> 09:53.584
- to others.
- And certain things need

09:53.619 --> 09:57.188
a little extra space so they
can stand out from the rest.

09:57.223 --> 09:59.463
One of the many differences
between me and my daughter.

09:59.492 --> 10:01.459
Oh yeah, we fight all the time.

10:01.494 --> 10:04.195
Kevin.

10:04.230 --> 10:07.431
- Did you get some breakfast?
- I did, thanks.

10:07.467 --> 10:10.468
And now I'm off to try to talk
to that old friend of mine.

10:10.503 --> 10:12.937
Kevin used to work with
Abigail back in New York.

10:12.972 --> 10:16.040
Have you been to the Middleton
Botanical Gardens yet?

10:16.075 --> 10:18.976
- They're quite spectacular.
- I haven't heard of them, no.

10:19.697 --> 10:21.345
I thought I saw you
looking at a brochure

10:21.380 --> 10:24.482
and map of the Gardens.
In the dining room?

10:24.517 --> 10:26.717
Was I? Maybe. Yeah.

10:26.753 --> 10:30.488
- Anyhow, thank you for breakfast.
- You're welcome.

10:30.523 --> 10:34.458
Have a great day.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.333
Stephanie. Where are you off to?

10:42.368 --> 10:44.235
The Gardens. I wanted
to see the Merriwick.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.471
- I was just there, myself.
- Ooh! How's that plant doing?

10:47.540 --> 10:50.741
- Still not in bloom.
- Oh. Well, from what I've heard

10:50.777 --> 10:53.511
it's leaving everyone
anticipating that it might.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.348
"Leaves of anticipation."

10:57.383 --> 10:59.319
Is that what I said?

10:59.433 --> 11:02.067
Well, not exactly, no, but I'm
trying to come up with something

11:02.102 --> 11:04.047
to write in that tourism book
and I only have three days

11:04.071 --> 11:05.292
before it goes to press.

11:05.317 --> 11:07.105
So we need this plant
to bloom before then?

11:07.140 --> 11:10.141
For the good of the town,
yes. Pour some of this on it,

11:10.177 --> 11:13.378
that poor thing.
Maybe that'll spruce it up.

11:13.413 --> 11:15.649
- This is iced tea.
- Oh. Well, in that case,

11:15.674 --> 11:18.057
pour me a glass. I'm parched!

11:25.125 --> 11:26.586
Thank you.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.295
Ma'am.

11:30.330 --> 11:32.408
Hi, can I help you?

11:34.134 --> 11:35.767
We're closed.

11:36.762 --> 11:40.071
- It's ten in the morning.
- Then let me rephrase that.

11:40.107 --> 11:41.773
Go away.

11:41.808 --> 11:44.275
Abigail, I came here to apologize.

11:44.311 --> 11:46.354
- Then you wasted a trip.
- Would you please just

11:46.389 --> 11:50.081
hear me out. Look, I was
finally able to see things

11:50.117 --> 11:52.764
how you saw them and I realized
how... terrible I was.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.832
It's weird how you keep
talking as if I care

11:54.867 --> 11:55.995
about anything you have to say.

11:56.020 --> 11:58.034
Please, just let me
explain what happened.

11:58.058 --> 12:01.760
Kevin, you fired me
from my own ad agency

12:01.795 --> 12:03.428
that you and I started with our partners

12:03.463 --> 12:05.997
who I thought I could trust.

12:06.032 --> 12:07.766
I know,

12:07.801 --> 12:10.201
I was a very bad colleague
and an even worse friend.

12:11.233 --> 12:12.470
Do you know why

12:12.506 --> 12:14.973
I didn't fight you
when you told me I was out?

12:15.008 --> 12:17.075
Because I knew it was going to happen.

12:17.397 --> 12:19.407
I knew you were all been going
behind my back, I was just

12:19.442 --> 12:21.220
waiting for you to come and tell me.

12:22.382 --> 12:25.049
But I decided that if
I was going to be treated

12:25.085 --> 12:28.363
like that by my partners...
my friends...

12:29.235 --> 12:30.923
then I didn't want

12:30.958 --> 12:32.689
any of you to be either one.

12:34.051 --> 12:36.662
I can only imagine
how hard that was on you.

12:36.697 --> 12:38.497
No, you can't.

12:38.532 --> 12:40.933
But thanks so much for trying.

12:48.475 --> 12:50.842
You know, it wasn't until
you left that I realized

12:50.878 --> 12:52.511
how bad I'd blown it.

12:52.546 --> 12:54.998
Not just for the business, but...

12:55.883 --> 12:57.470
for the two of us.

12:58.552 --> 13:01.954
- There was never an "us."
- I always felt

13:01.989 --> 13:03.438
like there could have been.

13:03.857 --> 13:05.991
Didn't it always seem like
there was almost something

13:06.026 --> 13:08.827
- that was gonna start between us?
- Maybe.

13:09.157 --> 13:11.530
That's what makes this so much worse.

13:12.047 --> 13:14.366
But I'm glad that I was
able to come here

13:14.401 --> 13:16.969
and see you and apologize
for messing everything up.

13:20.874 --> 13:22.975
You came all the way
to Middleton to say that?

13:23.010 --> 13:25.397
I did, yeah.

13:26.846 --> 13:29.114
At least I get the chance
to say it in person.

13:29.672 --> 13:32.985
Abigail, I'm sorry.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.037
<i>OK, when would you like to come in?</i>

13:52.844 --> 13:55.811
I'll let the doctor know. Bye-bye.

13:55.847 --> 13:58.114
- Oh, Doctor Radford.
- Mm-hm?

13:58.149 --> 14:00.549
- That was Mister Borba.
- He said the prescription

14:00.585 --> 14:02.551
you gave him for his knee didn't help.

14:02.587 --> 14:05.029
Really? That should have
reduced the inflammation,

14:05.053 --> 14:07.823
- for sure.
- Maybe you can send him to...

14:09.090 --> 14:10.726
No, he came here.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.495
- What?
- Never mind.

14:12.530 --> 14:14.208
I'm going to make some tea.
Do you want some?

14:14.232 --> 14:17.500
What I want is to know
what you were about to say.

14:17.535 --> 14:19.173
Well...

14:19.821 --> 14:21.737
It's just, I hear some of your patients

14:21.773 --> 14:24.840
talking about different
things they've gotten at...

14:25.647 --> 14:29.712
Bell, Book and Candle... and it seems

14:29.747 --> 14:31.680
to have helped them out a lot!

14:31.716 --> 14:34.683
But when they need
a doctor, they come here.

14:34.719 --> 14:37.987
Which is what Mister Borba
did, and he's still...

14:38.022 --> 14:40.556
limping around with an inflamed knee.

14:40.591 --> 14:43.426
- I'll figure it out.
- Maybe sometimes, it wouldn't

14:43.461 --> 14:45.594
hurt to ask, "What would Cassie do?"

14:45.630 --> 14:48.651
She mentioned

14:48.687 --> 14:52.601
this could be used
as an anti-inflammatory.

14:54.906 --> 14:57.773
I'm not about to tell one of
my patients that all of my years

14:57.809 --> 14:59.920
of medical training lead me
to believe that his best course

14:59.944 --> 15:02.878
- of action is to try tea.
- I can put it

15:02.914 --> 15:05.948
in a compress. You can put it in a fancy

15:05.983 --> 15:09.218
medical bag. He'll never even know.

15:10.999 --> 15:12.888
"What would Cassie do?"

15:12.924 --> 15:16.358
I won't tell her, either.

15:20.932 --> 15:22.798
<i>So, where did you guys go?</i>

15:22.834 --> 15:24.867
We met at the park and
then, I took her to lunch.

15:24.902 --> 15:26.902
- What did you eat?
- I had a burger.

15:26.938 --> 15:28.437
- With French fries?
- Yeah!

15:28.473 --> 15:30.606
And did she reach over
and take any of your fries?

15:30.641 --> 15:32.908
She took a couple.

15:32.944 --> 15:34.777
So that means she really likes you.

15:34.812 --> 15:36.612
I don't know what it means.

15:36.647 --> 15:38.926
Courtney likes you. That is
what French fry taking means.

15:38.950 --> 15:41.250
- Trust me, I know.
- Yeah, well...

15:41.285 --> 15:43.697
thanks for helping me with the right
things to say before I asked her.

15:43.721 --> 15:46.489
Sure! I don't remember saying
anything that mattered, but...

15:46.524 --> 15:49.959
But at least I was able to
come to you, as a friend.

15:50.676 --> 15:52.728
Yeah. Any time.

15:52.763 --> 15:56.432
And I also took the advice
from my dad and brought flowers.

15:56.467 --> 15:59.168
Oh, I heard. Courtney said
you picked them yourself.

15:59.203 --> 16:03.772
Yeah, I found some good ones when I went

16:03.808 --> 16:07.443
to Middleton Gardens
and... Well, I mean,

16:07.478 --> 16:10.513
- I found what I needed.
- OK.

16:11.242 --> 16:12.877
Are you guys going
to see each other again?

16:12.912 --> 16:15.518
- I... think so.
- So, you're dating!

16:16.011 --> 16:18.420
We're gonna go out again.

16:18.456 --> 16:20.956
- You're dating!
- You can call it what you want.

16:20.992 --> 16:23.959
- Oh, it is called dating.
- Why do you have to be so literal.

16:23.995 --> 16:26.962
I'm only being literal because
you are literally dating.

16:26.998 --> 16:30.966
- Whatever.
- You are.

16:37.008 --> 16:39.174
- Oh, hello!
- This is a nice surprise.

16:39.210 --> 16:41.977
I was just thinking
about you, thought I'd stop by.

16:42.013 --> 16:44.480
- Well, I'm glad you did.
- Hm!

16:44.515 --> 16:47.383
- What's that?
- Oh, the Merriwick women

16:47.418 --> 16:50.319
have been scrapbooking since
before scrapbooking was a thing.

16:50.354 --> 16:52.988
Hm! Been reading about what happened

16:53.024 --> 16:56.625
the years when
the Merriwick bloomed, and...

16:57.642 --> 16:59.628
- the years when it didn't.
- Hm!

16:59.664 --> 17:02.998
- Are you finding anything out?
- Not really.

17:03.034 --> 17:06.502
I mean, there are stories about
how the community came together

17:06.530 --> 17:08.530
the few times the flower bloomed.

17:08.571 --> 17:10.973
Which may or may not
have anything at all to do

17:11.008 --> 17:14.175
- with the flower.
- But nothing about the years

17:14.211 --> 17:17.079
when it looked like it might,
but then, it didn't.

17:17.696 --> 17:19.348
You really think

17:19.383 --> 17:22.885
that a plant can affect what
happens in an entire community?

17:22.920 --> 17:25.820
I've always felt that
everything is connected.

17:25.856 --> 17:27.990
We're talking about a plant!

17:28.025 --> 17:29.992
Well, I didn't mean
to clutter up your mind

17:30.027 --> 17:32.928
- with unprovable thoughts.
- Just don't let that plant

17:32.964 --> 17:35.264
- know what I really think.
- Excuse me,

17:35.299 --> 17:37.066
do you have anything for heartburn?

17:37.101 --> 17:41.203
Oh yes. There are ginger
candies over on that shelf.

17:42.234 --> 17:44.173
I'm allergic to ginger.

17:44.673 --> 17:47.910
Oh! Uh... Well...

17:47.945 --> 17:50.245
Why don't you, um,

17:50.281 --> 17:52.681
try not eating anything after six PM?

17:52.717 --> 17:56.051
- And try sleeping on your side.
- I'll give that a try.

17:57.732 --> 17:58.787
Thanks.

17:58.823 --> 18:01.482
- I'm glad I was here to help.
- Yeah.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.767
Thank you very much.

18:11.802 --> 18:14.937
If I have any more questions
I'll get back to you.

18:15.579 --> 18:17.039
So,

18:17.074 --> 18:20.042
- how goes the investigation?
- It's moving along.

18:20.077 --> 18:22.778
I was just talking to
an expert trying to find out

18:22.813 --> 18:24.747
what a plant like that might be worth.

18:24.782 --> 18:27.282
- The Merriwick is priceless.
- Yeah,

18:27.318 --> 18:29.718
but if it could be replicated and sold,

18:29.754 --> 18:32.087
that could make a person a lot of money.

18:32.123 --> 18:34.757
- I suppose they could.
- Plus, I think

18:34.792 --> 18:36.992
I'm gonna head back out
to the site again. I still feel

18:37.028 --> 18:39.239
- like there's something I missed.
- Well, it sounds like you're

18:39.263 --> 18:41.096
going down all the right paths. Oh!

18:41.132 --> 18:45.100
"The garden paths that lead to
the forest that is Middleton."

18:45.136 --> 18:48.771
Oh, that sounded horrible the
moment it came out of my mouth.

18:48.806 --> 18:50.839
I just can't seem to
come up with the right words

18:50.875 --> 18:53.342
for that book. But I know who can help.

18:53.377 --> 18:55.778
What... Where are you going?

18:55.813 --> 18:58.247
- To see Cassie.
- There has never been

18:58.282 --> 19:01.483
a more crucial time
when I've needed my muse!

19:09.097 --> 19:10.626
Hey, Grace!

19:10.661 --> 19:12.628
- Yeah?
- Can I ask you something?

19:12.663 --> 19:16.665
- Uh, sure.
- OK, how are you with numbers?

19:16.701 --> 19:20.135
I got a C minus on my calculus pop quiz,

19:20.171 --> 19:22.137
so, below average.

19:22.173 --> 19:24.473
- Great.
- Yeah.

19:24.508 --> 19:26.148
I just wanted a couple people's opinions

19:26.177 --> 19:29.144
on an investment Ben wants
to make in a movie theater.

19:29.180 --> 19:32.181
You want financial advice from me?

19:32.216 --> 19:35.317
I guess it's more
like relationship advice.

19:35.352 --> 19:38.120
Well, then, you better
talk to my mother!

19:38.155 --> 19:41.156
At her shop. That is
a great idea. Thanks.

19:41.192 --> 19:44.226
Ah! Help yourself to a cookie!

19:44.681 --> 19:46.028
Hey!

19:46.489 --> 19:48.831
I earned a cookie!

19:56.373 --> 19:58.173
Closed?

19:58.209 --> 20:00.142
But I need to talk to Cassie.

20:00.177 --> 20:02.385
After me, dear, after me!

20:03.547 --> 20:06.715
- What's going on?
- I'm closed.

20:06.751 --> 20:09.852
- W... For how long?
- Until...

20:10.491 --> 20:12.988
I don't know.

20:13.023 --> 20:15.691
- But I need you.
- Her and me both.

20:15.726 --> 20:17.926
I wish I could help, but,

20:17.962 --> 20:19.661
right now, I can't.

20:20.159 --> 20:23.365
- So, we're just on our own?
- It certainly looks like it.

20:23.867 --> 20:26.034
I'm sorry.

20:26.070 --> 20:28.370
But... without Cassie,

20:28.405 --> 20:31.137
what... what are any of us to do?

20:56.353 --> 20:58.953
- Mom?
- Hey, sweetie.

20:58.989 --> 21:01.589
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

21:01.625 --> 21:04.993
So, what are you doing?

21:05.695 --> 21:08.463
- Just sitting here.
- Me and the Grey Lady.

21:08.498 --> 21:11.433
Ah. She's so beautiful.

21:11.468 --> 21:14.469
I've always felt that
you look just like her.

21:15.037 --> 21:17.702
Except I'm not feeling
very much like her right now.

21:17.727 --> 21:20.648
Yeah, none of the Merriwicks
are having their best week ever.

21:21.434 --> 21:23.278
I guess we take after the plant.

21:23.903 --> 21:25.673
Is that thing ever going to get better?

21:26.520 --> 21:28.699
- I don't know.
- I hope so.

21:29.967 --> 21:31.302
Yeah...

21:32.459 --> 21:34.171
me, too.

21:37.639 --> 21:39.410
I thought you never
wanted to see me again.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.879
I'm still not sure
that I do. I just know

21:41.915 --> 21:44.093
when someone says they're sorry,
what they're looking to hear

21:44.117 --> 21:47.672
is, "I forgive you." So, there you go.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.887
Well, that's more than I ever expected.

21:49.923 --> 21:52.757
Well, I've always
been full of surprises.

21:53.184 --> 21:55.359
I really am sorry, you know.

21:55.593 --> 21:59.163
And you just heard me
say, "I forgive you."

22:00.120 --> 22:02.099
Well, you might be happy to know

22:02.135 --> 22:04.769
that our business plans
didn't work out after you left.

22:04.804 --> 22:07.872
Hm! That does make me
a little bit happy.

22:07.907 --> 22:11.075
Hm! So, we're finally getting around

22:11.110 --> 22:13.344
to dissolving the company
so we can quit paying

22:13.379 --> 22:16.956
- filing fees each year.
- May it rest in peace.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.017
Cynthia actually called me
a couple of weeks ago.

22:20.053 --> 22:23.254
Apparently there's some papers
us original owners

22:23.289 --> 22:25.623
- needed to sign.
- I'll be happy

22:25.658 --> 22:27.925
to sign anything
to put that all behind me.

22:29.275 --> 22:30.544
Oh, right,

22:30.579 --> 22:32.360
I guess we'll need
your signature as well.

22:33.429 --> 22:36.067
And then we can all move on.

22:39.639 --> 22:42.139
Doc, I don't know what you
gave me for the knee, but it's

22:42.175 --> 22:44.442
- feeling an awful lot better.
- So that stuff worked?

22:44.477 --> 22:47.144
Yeah! Yeah, I held it
on there like you said,

22:47.180 --> 22:49.714
you know, twenty minutes
on, twenty minutes off

22:49.749 --> 22:51.660
and woke up this morning,
I could at least bend it, it's

22:51.684 --> 22:53.884
- a lot better than yesterday.
- Well, that's...

22:54.770 --> 22:56.387
...good, then.

22:56.422 --> 22:59.323
Yeah! And the knee ended up
smelling like cinnamon cookies.

22:59.359 --> 23:02.159
How often does a knee
get to smell like that?

23:02.195 --> 23:04.328
Not very.

23:04.364 --> 23:07.431
So I was wondering, can I get
a little bit more of that stuff?

23:08.461 --> 23:11.335
I don't know. Do we have
more of the... prescription?

23:11.371 --> 23:15.072
- Sorry, we're all out.
- Oh. Well, that's a shame.

23:15.108 --> 23:18.009
It's OK, I know
where I can get some more.

23:18.044 --> 23:20.370
I'll drop it off at your house.

23:20.406 --> 23:22.656
You sir, are the best doctor in town.

23:22.692 --> 23:25.616
- I'm the only doctor in town.
- You see, I was right!

23:26.948 --> 23:28.614
What would Cassie do?

23:28.639 --> 23:31.840
- She wouldn't gloat!
- Who's gloating?!

23:37.748 --> 23:40.248
First you need to find the motive.

23:41.287 --> 23:43.418
That's what Columbo would do.

23:43.454 --> 23:45.387
I don't know who that is.

23:45.422 --> 23:48.123
He was just good at his job, that's all.

23:50.019 --> 23:52.620
You know, at first I thought
it was vandalism, but...

23:52.796 --> 23:55.230
now I'm pretty sure
it was for personal gain.

23:55.265 --> 23:56.965
Next you need to find the weapon.

23:57.419 --> 23:59.701
You don't have to tell me
how to do my job, George.

23:59.736 --> 24:03.038
- Oh, sorry.
- But I would like to get

24:03.073 --> 24:05.307
my hands on those
gardening shears that made

24:05.342 --> 24:07.275
that cut. I feel like

24:07.311 --> 24:10.479
that could be the key
to solving this whole thing.

24:10.514 --> 24:12.414
In that case, I'm glad
you're on the job.

24:12.449 --> 24:16.251
Yeah, investigating
a whodunit about a plant.

24:16.286 --> 24:20.055
- That's why I joined the force.
- And it's a good thing

24:20.090 --> 24:21.515
that you did.

24:22.526 --> 24:24.893
This town needs the Merriwick.

24:24.928 --> 24:28.463
And it needs people
like you who care about it,

24:28.499 --> 24:31.666
and showing people
that this plant matters.

24:31.702 --> 24:35.637
That's what the people
of Middleton need to see.

24:37.115 --> 24:39.007
Thanks, George.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.775
Keep up the good work.

24:42.132 --> 24:44.613
Oh! And um...

24:45.541 --> 24:47.772
Um, one more thing...

24:47.807 --> 24:49.155
Yeah?

24:50.187 --> 24:52.954
No, that's what Columbo
always said. You know, like,

24:52.990 --> 24:55.690
- "one more thing."
- Yeah, I still...

24:55.726 --> 24:57.667
don't know who he is.

24:58.829 --> 25:00.331
Right.

25:14.378 --> 25:16.111
Still can't find inspiration, huh?

25:16.146 --> 25:18.313
No, and it better come
quickly. That tourism book

25:18.348 --> 25:20.482
is about to go to press
and I've got nothing.

25:20.517 --> 25:22.851
Is that book really such a big deal?

25:22.886 --> 25:26.221
It could draw countless
tourists to our town.

25:26.256 --> 25:29.124
Ooh, which would mean more
people at Ben's theater,

25:29.159 --> 25:31.293
if he can figure out how
to get money to invest in it.

25:31.328 --> 25:34.062
Yes, yes, yes, whatever, first
things first. Listen to this

25:34.097 --> 25:36.998
- and be completely honest.
- I always am.

25:37.034 --> 25:40.902
"Middleton was built upon the
bosom of optimism and the belief

25:40.938 --> 25:43.905
"of our noble and courageous
predecessors who planted

25:43.941 --> 25:46.341
"themselves on this land and grew

25:46.376 --> 25:48.327
amidst the soils of the earth."

25:49.258 --> 25:50.745
Yeah, you're gonna want people

25:50.781 --> 25:53.092
to still be awake when they
get to the end of that sentence.

25:53.116 --> 25:56.175
Right, that is a bit of
a snoozer. What about this one?

25:56.220 --> 26:00.055
"Middleton is a town that was
first watered by the founder's

26:00.090 --> 26:03.358
blood, their sweat, and their tears."

26:03.393 --> 26:05.827
Honestly? Yuck!

26:05.862 --> 26:08.163
I'm trying to make the point
that this town was created

26:08.198 --> 26:11.166
from nothing and that some
of its poorest founders invested

26:11.201 --> 26:13.835
in Middleton using... what's that phrase

26:13.870 --> 26:16.271
where you use your, you know,
your skills and your energy

26:16.306 --> 26:18.218
and blah blah blah instead of
finances to build something up?

26:18.242 --> 26:20.942
- Sweat equity?
- Yes, they used that.

26:22.095 --> 26:23.944
Yes, they did.

26:23.979 --> 26:26.381
And that's how this town grew.

26:27.501 --> 26:29.084
Yes, it did!

26:29.119 --> 26:31.953
- This is perfect, Martha!
- Thank you, dear...

26:31.989 --> 26:34.389
- Thanks!
- ...I've done it!

26:41.064 --> 26:44.566
- Hi, Grace.
- Oh! Sam.

26:44.601 --> 26:46.334
I was just headed to your mom's store...

26:46.370 --> 26:49.404
- to... do some shopping.
- Oh, well, I'm sorry, but Bell,

26:49.439 --> 26:52.407
- Book and Candle is closed.
- Closed?

26:52.442 --> 26:56.544
Yeah. she's... taking a few days off.

26:56.580 --> 27:00.048
- Hm. Is she OK?
- I think so.

27:01.446 --> 27:03.285
I'm not sure.

27:05.422 --> 27:08.657
- Maybe you should go see her.
- Hm. Is she at home?

27:08.692 --> 27:11.226
No. She went somewhere else.

27:11.261 --> 27:13.261
For inspiration.

27:13.297 --> 27:15.630
Hm.

27:15.666 --> 27:18.400
OK. Great, thanks!

27:30.924 --> 27:32.369
Found you.

27:33.293 --> 27:35.961
I just wanted to be with the Merriwick.

27:35.996 --> 27:38.096
How's that thing doing?

27:38.792 --> 27:40.632
Not so good.

27:40.667 --> 27:44.169
Struggling. Unsure
if she'll ever stand as tall

27:44.204 --> 27:48.940
as she once did, and...
be what she once was.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.744
I know that sounds crazy to you,

27:52.779 --> 27:54.646
hearing me talk about a plant that way.

27:54.681 --> 27:57.649
Nothing you say ever sounds crazy.

27:57.684 --> 28:00.285
Yeah, but you don't believe it.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.455
I don't know that
it matters what I believe.

28:03.490 --> 28:06.024
You know, plants have an energy, Sam.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.527
You can feel what they're saying
if you're quiet long enough.

28:12.161 --> 28:15.133
What's the Merriwick
saying to you right now?

28:15.601 --> 28:19.104
I can't hear a thing.

28:22.642 --> 28:25.310
I'm a doctor. Maybe
I should examine the patient.

28:25.345 --> 28:28.146
- Well, you never know.
- Ah...

28:29.045 --> 28:31.816
I never realized everything
was so... connected.

28:32.315 --> 28:34.719
It looks like whoever did
the clipping also nicked

28:34.755 --> 28:37.622
the main stem, it's seeping there.

28:37.657 --> 28:41.059
So... what's the diagnosis?

28:41.094 --> 28:43.995
- I don't know.
- Unfortunately it's not my field.

28:44.699 --> 28:48.186
We might just have
to... sit here and wait

28:48.222 --> 28:51.336
to see if the Merriwick pulls through.

28:53.607 --> 28:57.342
So... we just sit here and wait.

29:14.357 --> 29:17.725
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning!

29:17.760 --> 29:19.633
Ah, sorry there's nothing freshly made,

29:19.658 --> 29:21.658
but there's fruit and
a few day-old muffins.

29:21.694 --> 29:24.328
- It looks great.
- Here you go.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.096
Thank you.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.298
So, are you enjoying your stay here?

29:28.334 --> 29:31.468
I am, but I'm eager
to see the Merriwick bloom.

29:32.573 --> 29:34.938
I really didn't think
it would be taking this long.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.673
Yeah, the damage that was done

29:36.709 --> 29:38.609
has thrown everything off-schedule.

29:38.644 --> 29:41.378
Right, well as soon as it blossoms,

29:41.414 --> 29:43.280
I'll probably be on my way.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.049
I've already spoken
to a few of my peers who are

29:46.085 --> 29:48.063
quite interested in the research
I've been doing and they're

29:48.087 --> 29:51.155
- eager to see me published.
- Which could get you

29:51.190 --> 29:52.293
a lot of attention.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.827
- What?
- My father never understood

29:56.862 --> 30:00.497
why I wanted to be a botanist.
He wanted me to do something

30:00.533 --> 30:02.092
that got a person noticed.

30:03.035 --> 30:07.137
I don't know, he might finally
say that what I do is worth it.

30:07.997 --> 30:10.507
Well, I hope he sees what you've done.

30:10.543 --> 30:13.644
- Some juice?
- Mm-hm! Yes, please.

30:14.236 --> 30:16.513
This is good! Hm!

30:16.549 --> 30:19.082
You know,

30:19.118 --> 30:21.752
I can't believe I'm saying this but...

30:21.787 --> 30:24.588
it's actually good to see you again.

30:24.623 --> 30:27.991
Oh, well... I'm glad I made the trip.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.160
It's a shame you have to leave so soon.

30:30.196 --> 30:33.664
Well, I could extend my stay,
if there's room at Grey House.

30:33.699 --> 30:36.200
I can probably talk to the owner.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.435
I'm sure we can make something happen.

30:38.471 --> 30:40.537
That would be great.

30:41.355 --> 30:43.540
Oh, Cynthia emailed me

30:43.576 --> 30:46.710
those documents we're supposed to
sign to phase-out our company.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.545
Oh, you printed them out already?

30:48.581 --> 30:51.048
I figured you'd want to just
sign it and get it over with.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.218
- Yeah, sure.
- "Corporate Dissolution."

30:54.253 --> 30:56.620
Hey, it'll be like
none of that ever happened.

30:56.655 --> 30:59.089
I wish it was so easy...

30:59.124 --> 31:02.626
Ugh, I forgot to
order vases and I'm also

31:02.661 --> 31:06.630
- out of pens.
- Oh, got one right here!

31:14.306 --> 31:17.307
You know, I should probably
read these over first.

31:17.343 --> 31:20.544
- Oh, it's pretty standard.
- It's a formality, really.

31:20.579 --> 31:23.614
I know, it's just I haven't
really been feeling myself

31:23.649 --> 31:26.216
and I just want to be sure of things

31:26.252 --> 31:30.254
at a time when... not feeling so sure.

31:30.289 --> 31:34.258
- OK! I mean...
- OK, sure.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.639
I'm sure that by the time
tomorrow gets here I'll be

31:37.663 --> 31:40.218
feeling... ready to
move on with my life.

31:40.766 --> 31:43.299
And then we can see
what happens after that.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.722
I should probably get back to work.

31:47.757 --> 31:49.212
OK

31:49.975 --> 31:52.743
Hi, can I help you with anything?

31:55.814 --> 31:59.082
- Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
- Oh, there you are.

31:59.118 --> 32:02.486
Come with me. I've been
thinking about that theater

32:02.521 --> 32:04.688
- you're about to own.
- Oh, if I can figure out a way

32:04.723 --> 32:06.456
- to buy in to it.
- Then it's a good thing

32:06.492 --> 32:08.625
you're dating me, because I already did.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.627
Stephanie, no, I'm
not taking your money.

32:10.663 --> 32:14.031
Good, because I'm not offering it.
But you already have

32:14.066 --> 32:17.768
everything you need.
It's called "sweat equity."

32:18.685 --> 32:20.637
I hadn't really thought about that.

32:20.673 --> 32:23.807
I've seen the work you do,
you're the best in town.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.943
So, if those guys want
to put in their funds,

32:25.978 --> 32:28.145
you can put up what really counts:

32:28.180 --> 32:31.648
your heart and your soul
and actual work.

32:31.684 --> 32:33.650
I could do that, yeah.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.664
They'd be idiots not
to take you on as a partner.

32:35.688 --> 32:38.822
And then you'd own part
of the theater when it's done.

32:39.660 --> 32:41.325
This is a really good idea.

32:41.717 --> 32:43.527
Martha helped me come up with it.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.496
- I'll have to thank her, too.
- Just make sure to put

32:46.532 --> 32:48.966
a couple seats in the balcony
so we can snuggle and kiss

32:49.001 --> 32:52.302
- when the lights go out.
- I haven't done that since high school.

32:52.338 --> 32:55.539
Oh, this is going to be
a lot better than high school.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.918
Sam! What are you doing here?

33:07.953 --> 33:09.920
I'm not exactly sure.

33:09.955 --> 33:11.989
Well, there's always room for one more.

33:12.763 --> 33:15.692
It's very special, the Merriwick.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.694
- I'm finding that out.
- Especially

33:17.730 --> 33:20.731
to Cassie. It's as though
the two were connected somehow.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.400
I don't know what
I'd do without either one.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.336
- Neither do I.
- Well, I need to get this

33:26.372 --> 33:28.905
- to the printers.
- I think I'm going to stay

33:28.941 --> 33:32.275
for a while. Soak up
the spirit of the place.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.945
Could it be that
Middleton's man of medicine

33:34.980 --> 33:37.585
is finally starting to believe in magic?

33:38.223 --> 33:40.089
No.

33:40.319 --> 33:43.350
But I do believe in Cassie.

34:22.822 --> 34:24.127
I had a feeling

34:24.163 --> 34:25.918
something wonderful had happened.

34:26.585 --> 34:28.551
Look!

34:28.801 --> 34:31.768
I came as soon as I could
to see if it was true.

34:31.804 --> 34:34.337
I managed to get into
the Gardens early, before

34:34.373 --> 34:36.583
they officially opened so I could
be the first one to see it.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.442
Does that mean you had a feeling, too?

34:38.476 --> 34:41.712
What I had was my research
from the past few days

34:41.746 --> 34:43.980
and a PhD that helped me
put it all together.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.016
Hm! You must have been
a very good student.

34:46.051 --> 34:48.752
Graduated at the top of my class.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.754
- Mom.
- Hi.

34:50.789 --> 34:54.123
So, I got out of bed and
my camera was working again.

34:54.935 --> 34:58.428
Ah, one of this morning's
many surprises.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.291
Yeah! I came here to take some pictures

35:00.326 --> 35:02.799
but I had no idea
the plant was in bloom.

35:02.835 --> 35:05.702
- Isn't it amazing?
- I've never seen anything like it.

35:05.738 --> 35:09.139
Ooh. I didn't know
we were having a party!

35:09.174 --> 35:11.007
The Merriwick is standing tall.

35:11.043 --> 35:13.510
Yes, I hoped so, but
I wanted to see for myself.

35:13.545 --> 35:16.213
Well, you came just in time,
because you're exactly

35:16.248 --> 35:20.169
the right person to tell me...
how hard would it be

35:20.205 --> 35:24.654
to make a hybrid species from
a graft of a plant like this?

35:24.690 --> 35:27.624
Super hard. I wouldn't even
try it with something so rare.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.659
- Oh.
- You have to really know a lot

35:29.695 --> 35:33.630
about botany. Like,
top-of-your-class, genius.

35:34.361 --> 35:37.000
I'm not sure what you're
trying to imply here...

35:37.592 --> 35:39.503
Grace, didn't you say

35:39.538 --> 35:41.505
you were taking pictures near here

35:41.540 --> 35:44.875
- the morning the Merriwick was cut?
- For my photography club.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.577
Hm. So, if there were
footprints left behind

35:47.613 --> 35:50.647
they would be in the pictures
on that camera, right there?

35:50.682 --> 35:53.183
Yeah, they might be.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.986
You can't prove
anything from footprints.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.255
I'm not sure what we could prove.

35:58.290 --> 36:02.359
But I bet if we looked
at the blade on your shears,

36:02.394 --> 36:05.262
they would match the cut on that stalk.

36:05.740 --> 36:07.864
Well, even if you could do...

36:07.900 --> 36:10.233
Those shears don't even work.
The spring has been broken

36:10.269 --> 36:12.936
- since before I even got here.
- You mean,

36:12.971 --> 36:15.438
this spring, right here?

36:16.756 --> 36:18.875
I found it in the bushes
when I came to do

36:18.911 --> 36:21.878
my search. Must've flown off the shears

36:21.914 --> 36:24.815
- of whoever did this.
<i>- Your</i> shears.

36:24.850 --> 36:28.351
Then I saw her car parked out
front and I thought maybe Daphne

36:28.387 --> 36:31.521
came back to see if she
could find this for herself.

36:32.084 --> 36:34.891
She came to see if
the plant she nearly destroyed

36:34.927 --> 36:36.748
would come back to life.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.764
And now you're finally
ready to tell us the truth.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.103
I wanted to see if I could make a plant

36:47.139 --> 36:49.306
that would bloom with
that flower every year.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.274
That could have been worth a fortune.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.116
Except it wasn't about that.

36:53.946 --> 36:55.912
A special creation like that
could have been grown

36:55.948 --> 36:59.649
in every garden in the world.
And brought magic in their lives...

37:00.209 --> 37:02.953
and really gotten
a person like me noticed.

37:04.344 --> 37:06.156
I hope you start getting noticed

37:06.191 --> 37:08.664
for being the good person
I know you to be.

37:12.225 --> 37:13.897
Ma'am.

37:14.353 --> 37:16.099
I'm sorry.

37:31.664 --> 37:34.932
- Hi.
- Abigail! Hey! Where you been?

37:34.967 --> 37:37.668
Just out for a little
morning jaunt to clear my head

37:37.703 --> 37:40.805
- and get my spirits up.
- And?

37:40.840 --> 37:43.274
It's clear, and they're up.

37:43.309 --> 37:46.610
- Great.
- I was really hoping to get

37:46.646 --> 37:49.146
- this paperwork signed.
- All I need is your pen

37:49.182 --> 37:51.722
- and we can get this over with.
- Of course.

37:54.427 --> 37:56.120
There you go!

37:56.155 --> 37:57.695
Hm.

37:59.592 --> 38:01.659
Hm. You know what's funny?

38:01.694 --> 38:03.494
When we started our little agency,

38:03.529 --> 38:05.663
one of our dreams was
to be as big a company

38:05.698 --> 38:08.299
as Publicis one day. Do you remember?

38:09.558 --> 38:11.902
Well, dreams don't always come true.

38:11.938 --> 38:15.673
Hm. We always said that
if we ever got that huge,

38:15.708 --> 38:17.675
we'd buy up all the smaller companies

38:17.710 --> 38:19.577
and be in charge of everything.

38:20.476 --> 38:22.346
Yeah, I guess we said that, yeah.

38:22.381 --> 38:24.682
So when I saw this pen
...this Publicis pen...

38:24.717 --> 38:27.017
I started thinking
about that... and then

38:27.053 --> 38:29.920
I woke up this morning I made
a phone call to an attorney

38:29.956 --> 38:32.218
I know that works there, and
do you know what I found out?

38:32.725 --> 38:35.693
They're buying our company
because of one little account

38:35.728 --> 38:37.963
that's worth a lot of money to them.

38:38.634 --> 38:41.232
And if I were to sign these papers,

38:41.267 --> 38:43.901
I'd be cut out of the profits
of that, wouldn't I?

38:45.002 --> 38:46.504
Abigail, I'm sorry...

38:46.539 --> 38:49.707
No, you don't get to say that anymore.

38:51.059 --> 38:52.543
Because the only reason

38:52.578 --> 38:54.712
you came here was to get me to sign over

38:54.747 --> 38:56.642
what's worth a lot of money to me.

38:57.954 --> 39:01.252
So now that I know what I know,
I'm going to have my lawyer

39:01.287 --> 39:04.221
send over a different kind of contract.

39:04.257 --> 39:07.191
The kind where I'm protected
and it's gonna make sure I get

39:07.226 --> 39:09.156
every penny that I'm owed.

39:10.843 --> 39:13.731
You can use that pen when you sign it.

39:17.236 --> 39:19.281
I heard back from the tourism
committee. They loved

39:19.305 --> 39:22.039
what I wrote to go
with our flower: "Middleton.

39:22.074 --> 39:23.741
- We grow magic."
- Hm!

39:23.776 --> 39:26.744
- Clear. Concise. True.
- Stephanie led me to that

39:26.779 --> 39:29.480
in your absence. But sadly
they're not putting us

39:29.515 --> 39:32.249
on the cover. Apparently,
a plant that blooms so rarely

39:32.285 --> 39:35.286
isn't enough of a draw.
So it looks like we failed.

39:35.321 --> 39:37.955
I don't know how you can say
that. The whole community

39:37.990 --> 39:40.724
came together, everyone
helped everybody else.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.761
That's about as wonderful
and magical as things get.

39:43.796 --> 39:47.932
- I suppose it is.
- Oh, look at that.

39:48.684 --> 39:50.801
Yes. Very inspiring.

39:50.836 --> 39:53.737
Well, I'll leave you
to soak up its inspiration

39:53.773 --> 39:55.184
all on your own.

40:15.398 --> 40:16.860
Hello, Sam.

40:17.373 --> 40:20.030
- Surprise.
- My favorite kind.

40:20.066 --> 40:22.700
- What are you looking at?
- The Merriwick women

40:22.735 --> 40:24.768
standing in front of the Merriwick.

40:24.804 --> 40:28.138
- In full bloom.
- Because you believed in me.

40:29.654 --> 40:31.475
It really is pretty.

40:33.512 --> 40:36.313
Yeah. And standing
as tall as it's ever stood,

40:36.349 --> 40:38.515
thanks to everyone who believed.

40:39.973 --> 40:41.218
I'm really looking forward

40:41.253 --> 40:43.921
- to opening up my shop again.
- Everybody will be glad

40:43.956 --> 40:47.825
- to know you're back in business.
- And I have a full shipment

40:47.860 --> 40:49.960
of Malabathrum coming tomorrow.

40:50.301 --> 40:52.630
- You don't say?
- Hm!

40:53.254 --> 40:55.666
This town really needs you.

40:57.103 --> 40:59.837
Well, they managed
to get along OK without me.

41:00.534 --> 41:03.507
I hope we never have to again.

41:04.142 --> 41:05.709
You never will.
