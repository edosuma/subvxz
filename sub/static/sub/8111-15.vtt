the sign so he can see it.

Evan.

00:16.475 --> 00:17.510
Hey, buddy.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.184
Aren't you excited
to see Uncle Brant?

00:20.271 --> 00:21.226
No.

00:21.314 --> 00:22.770
No?

00:23.441 --> 00:25.056
I think you are.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.771
I think something else
is making you upset.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.102
You know
I'm leaving soon.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.688
And it's okay to be
upset about that.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.399
But, hey,
do you remember
what I told you

00:35.494 --> 00:37.405
when we were
watching wrestling
on Saturday night?

00:37.705 --> 00:38.945
Yeah.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.946
That you and Uncle Brant
are like the Reaper Brothers.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.202
That's right.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.829
And Uncle Brant
has been in the ring
a whole year.

00:44.921 --> 00:48.004
Now it's time
for Daddy to tag in.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.378

I need you in your
uncle's corner,

making sure he keeps
you and your mom safe.

Can you help me
with that?

Good.

Okay.

please step aside.
Sir, this is my brother.

No fever. Why couldn't
they take care of him
at a military hospital?

I think because they
wanted to annoy you.

who has a problem
with someone

03:46.102 --> 03:48.434
whose duty is to protect
our country blowing...

03:48.771 --> 03:52.605
Blowing the whistle
is honorable, precisely
because it's not dutiful.

03:53.359 --> 03:56.317
I'm sorry, you said "blowing."
Maybe you were going somewhere
else with that?

03:56.404 --> 03:57.484
He's a coward.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.070
He risked
his freedom.

04:00.241 --> 04:04.109
He anonymously
downloaded a computer
file from a secure page

04:04.328 --> 04:06.569
and uploaded it
to an unsecure page.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.655
Not exactly storming
Omaha Beach.

04:08.791 --> 04:13.000

because he was faking it
to avoid going to prison.

with not-medicine.

going on with House.
He just seemed off.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.846
Didn't even notice
that I walked out of
the room with this.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.434
You began to suspect
he was off

04:35.526 --> 04:39.018
when he didn't notice
the mug you stole
to see if he was off?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.524
What else didn't he
notice that you don't
want us to notice?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.869
Those are the same clothes
you wore yesterday.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.200
And you got
very defensive when House
took your birth control.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.286
Who was he?
Or better yet, she?

04:53.461 --> 04:57.045
Do I need to
explain the physiology
behind birth control?

04:57.131 --> 04:59.793
Attention deficit in a man
who has no attention deficits

04:59.884 --> 05:01.624
has to be
symptomatic
of something.

05:01.719 --> 05:04.335
You're right.
I'm thinking either
massive brain tumor,

05:04.513 --> 05:06.970
or his soap got canceled
and he's distracted.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.389
Could be dietary, Refsum.

05:09.518 --> 05:14.683
Or maybe he thinks
you just have more than one
non-descript, white blouse.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.723
Or serotonin syndrome?

05:19.737 --> 05:21.477
I'm not saying
he's definitely sick,

05:21.572 --> 05:23.312
I'm just saying
we should look into it.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.988
No, we shouldn't.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.569
If you believe
House is sick,

05:26.660 --> 05:29.037
it's only because
that's what he wants
you to believe.

05:34.919 --> 05:36.159
Let's go.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.872
We think the long flight
home allowed clots
to form in your leg.

Take this pill.

If you feel any
numbness in your leg
after a few minutes,

05:47.515 --> 05:48.504
it means we're right.

You should get comfortable
because you're gonna
be here for a while.

While we wait,
can you tell me why?

05:59.068 --> 06:00.774
It was the
right thing to do.

06:01.779 --> 06:06.614
There are reports that
insurgents are using your
video to recruit new members.

Making the voting public
aware of what's really
happening on the ground

06:09.787 --> 06:11.402

06:13.082 --> 06:14.868

means he disagrees.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.540
I think you're
being naive.

06:17.253 --> 06:18.618
And I know
you took an oath.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.871
If you want to influence
policy, run for office.

06:21.966 --> 06:25.550
Dad raised us
to believe that exposing
the truth is honorable.

06:25.636 --> 06:26.921
Hayes likes to
follow the rules.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.761
Yeah, because that's what
Dad taught us was honorable.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.468
You were 10 when he died,
you can't possibly have any...

06:32.560 --> 06:34.801
If Dad always
believed in blindly
following the rules,

06:34.937 --> 06:36.473
how do you
explain Tora Bora?

06:38.440 --> 06:40.647
My dad was commanding
a Special Forces unit.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.810
He lost communication
with his men,
they were assumed dead.

06:43.946 --> 06:47.154
He was ordered to
abandon them and focus
on the primary mission.

06:47.241 --> 06:51.234
He disobeyed that order,
went and found his men,
still alive and fighting.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.829
He saved their lives.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.320
Did he die in service?

06:54.498 --> 06:56.739
If it was something genetic,
it could help us.

06:56.834 --> 06:59.496
No, it won't help.
It was a one-car accident.

official story.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.336

on this and...

I can't feel my leg.

07:12.016 --> 07:14.348
No you don't.
We gave you a placebo

07:14.435 --> 07:18.178
to see if you'd
fake another symptom
to delay going to prison.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.024
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.
He's not faking.

07:23.527 --> 07:26.439
Because that's
not the way your
dad raised him?

07:26.864 --> 07:28.195
Yes.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.657
My stomach hurts, too.
(GRUNTING) What's going on?

07:37.875 --> 07:39.035
He's not faking.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.124
CHASE: Just because he's
got abdominal bruising

07:49.219 --> 07:51.050
doesn't mean he wasn't
faking the numbness.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.969
JESSICA:
He's not contesting
the treason charges.

07:53.057 --> 07:54.547
If his code of honor
is that strong,

07:54.642 --> 07:57.349
he's not going
to bother
faking symptoms.

07:58.687 --> 08:02.145
Pleading guilty
isn't honorable,
it's just stupid.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.567
A distal esophageal rupture
can lead to compartment
syndrome in his thigh.

08:06.695 --> 08:07.730
Explains both symptoms.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.486
No pain when
he swallows.

What is honor?
Dying for your country?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.241
Getting straight A's?

08:15.371 --> 08:18.238
Killing your daughter
because she had the
audacity to get raped?

08:18.415 --> 08:19.746
Ruptured triple-A?

08:19.875 --> 08:21.911
Doesn't explain
the seizures.

08:22.044 --> 08:25.912
Pancreatitis?
Gallstones obstructing
his pancreatic duct.

08:27.758 --> 08:32.923
People define honor
with whatever makes
them feel honorable.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.088
It's a circle
going nowhere.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.595
Which I guess is
what circles do.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.725
We'll ultrasound his belly
and look for the obstruction.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.937
Need your signature
on this order.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.526
The Army's leaning
on Foreman to make sure
this is done by the book.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.357
Didn't need an order
for his last treatment.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.443
His last treatment
wasn't a treatment.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.115

08:59.206 --> 09:00.787
lwill. From now on.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.142
Just about done.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.478
Good news. Based on her
thrifty shopping habits

09:28.569 --> 09:30.730
and taste for
artificial dairy,

09:30.821 --> 09:32.436

not a gold digger.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.984
Bad news.

09:35.659 --> 09:39.447
Based on his
Rhinotillexomania, he is.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.328
A compulsive addiction
to nose-picking.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.414
A small cut on the inside
of the left nostril

09:44.501 --> 09:47.584
led to an infection
in the cavernous sinus.

six months ago.
He signed this today.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.196

are unsteady.

10:17.284 --> 10:21.994

I think he has

out new knish recipes.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.285
One of them didn't
agree with him.

10:29.379 --> 10:33.122
A little sleep deprivation
could account for his
forgetfulness and inattention.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.378
He loads up on caffeine,
that explains a jittery hand.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.541
Maybe.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.008
But if I'm right,
his liver's in decline.

10:40.390 --> 10:44.303
lt's curable, but
if he doesn't get treatment,
it could actually be fatal.

This happens
all the time.

in the clinic,
like I always do?

supposed to have lunch.

destroy your body
with Vicodin for years.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.962
Get enough death threats,
eventually they start
taking them seriously.

12:38.050 --> 12:41.042
A convoy was hit
outside of Kunar Province.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.802
Eight American
soldiers were killed.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.053

claiming that it's revenge for
the attack that I made public.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.721
Better me take
the blame than them.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.469
You don't think
you're to blame at all?

12:52.564 --> 12:55.897
And you do?
Like everyone else.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.314
A strike like that
would take more than
three days to plan.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.690
So the next one
might be your fault?

13:04.076 --> 13:05.907
Lateral view
looks good.
(SlGHlNG)

13:07.245 --> 13:10.408
If you have such
a negative opinion of the
Army, why did you enlist?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.993
I needed to find out
what really happened
to my dad.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.042
There were two
redacted pages in
his service record.

13:16.505 --> 13:19.838
Going into intelligence
was the quickest way to
up my security clearance.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.210
Then why would you
leak that video?

13:23.095 --> 13:26.258
Part of my job
was to grab a cup of
tea with the locals.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.054
The face-time is
supposed to make them

13:28.266 --> 13:30.757
more likely to trust us
with sensitive information,

13:32.521 --> 13:33.761
butthey
became my friends.

13:34.189 --> 13:38.057
If there was another attack,
civilian casualties,
and I had done nothing...

13:38.193 --> 13:41.185
Your spleen. lt's enlarged.
We should do a biopsy and
look for any...

13:41.279 --> 13:43.065
He's got
urinary bleeding.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.276
CHl: Notjust urinary.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.274
I'll call the blood bank.
HAYES: What's
happening to him?

13:50.580 --> 13:52.866
His spleen must be
sequestering platelets.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.164
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

13:54.251 --> 13:56.537
He's bleeding
too fast to wait for
a platelet infusion.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.040
We need to squeeze his spleen
to release the ones he's got.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.087
Tell the OR we're on our way.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.218
TAUB: Pressure's dropping.
CHASE: Almost there.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.047
BP's 70 over 40,
and he's hypovolemic.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.446
(MONITOR BLEEPS)

14:23.530 --> 14:24.610
Pressure's rising.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.605
And he's starting
to clot.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.484
CHASE: Good news is we
can control the bleeding.

14:30.620 --> 14:34.238
Bad news is,
bleeding's not the problem.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.789
Unless spleens are
supposed to be lumpy.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.133
JESSICA: He's clotting,
but CT confirmed
splenic nodules.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.961
Dr. Taub has an
interesting theory.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.045
No, I don't.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.967
You're forfeiting?

14:52.350 --> 14:54.386
If you can't play
the game and work...

14:55.312 --> 14:56.973
Extramedullary

14:57.147 --> 14:58.227
No history of anemia.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.312
She's right.
You're an idiot.
Try again.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.231
Where I come from,
this is called
"cheating."

15:02.736 --> 15:05.478
Where's that?
Stickford-Upon-Anus?

15:06.073 --> 15:07.062
TB.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.489
PPD was negative.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.737
Don't interrupt
Dr. Taub.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.660

15:13.830 --> 15:15.536
You just took out
a family of four.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.576
They were clearly
armed insurgents,

15:17.667 --> 15:20.079
and anyone who claims
or proves otherwise

15:20.170 --> 15:21.580
is a traitor.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.332
No rash or back pain.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.502
You defend
the patient for being
a whistle-blower,

15:26.676 --> 15:29.463
then attack him for being
an honorable whistle-blower,

15:29.554 --> 15:32.421
now you defend him
for being a maligned,
honorable whistle-blower?

15:32.557 --> 15:36.095
Adjectives matter.
Hate nurses, love
naughty nurses.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.596
Taub, pitch again.

15:37.687 --> 15:38.676
I've pitched
like five...

15:38.772 --> 15:40.103
It's your turn.

15:40.232 --> 15:41.267
(SIGHS) Lymphoma?

15:41.358 --> 15:42.393
JESSICA: If cancer
caused his seizures,

15:42.526 --> 15:44.482
we would have seen
cerebral masses
on his head CT.

15:44.569 --> 15:45.604
TAUB: Yes!

15:45.946 --> 15:48.028
Taub, pitch again. Now!

15:49.950 --> 15:53.192
The nodules in his
spleen were granulomas.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.531
He's got sarcoidosis!

15:57.541 --> 15:58.747
Someone tell him
he's wrong.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.742
Sorry, House.
Sarcoid does
explain the seizures.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.125
And the bruises.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.794
Say "bye-bye," House.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.049
Yes! (GRUNTS) Yes!

16:13.932 --> 16:17.265
Sarcoidosis it is.
Treat it with steroids.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.222
Then come
right back here,

16:20.313 --> 16:24.226
'cause I'm not gonna rest
until I've made orphans of
all your virtual children.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.901
House never loses.

16:29.072 --> 16:32.439
Seriously? Me beating House
is medically significant?

16:32.576 --> 16:34.191
It could be.

16:34.286 --> 16:38.655
Reduced fine motor control.
Add that to
inattention and liver flap.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.581
It does make sense.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.499
We have to talk
to Foreman.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.248
No, we don't.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.956
First of all,
because I can beat
him in that game.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.880
And second, even if
you are right, there's
no reason to believe

16:52.971 --> 16:54.757
that House's medical
judgment is impaired.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.263
So we should wait
until he kills someone
for confirmation?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.966
Do you really think it's
a coincidence that we're
treating a whistle-blower

17:00.103 --> 17:02.594
and now talking about
blowing the whistle on House?

17:03.315 --> 17:05.772
You're right.
Playing dumb.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.684
A messy signature.
Losing a video game.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.814
It's way too
complicated to fake.

17:15.619 --> 17:18.281
No. I won't take it.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.456
Without this injection,
you could have a fatal
arrhythmia.

17:24.002 --> 17:27.335
Tell Major Mathewson
that I'm not taking
any more treatment

17:27.422 --> 17:29.754
until they give me a live
television interview.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.548
You can't really think
they'll agree to that?

17:32.636 --> 17:35.719
People need to know
the tape's not the
reason for that attack.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.306
They need to know
why I did this.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.757
The people who think
you're a traitor will still
think you're a traitor,

17:40.852 --> 17:44.094
and the people who think
you're a hero will still
think you're a hero.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.895
The truth makes
a difference.

17:46.024 --> 17:49.687
If Dad were here,
he'd be begging for
you not to do this.

17:49.778 --> 17:53.566
If Dad were here,
he'd be proud of me.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.412
The conspiracy theorists
are gonna go nuts if the
patient dies.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.874
I told him that, and
he told me that option
is still less damaging

18:13.969 --> 18:15.675
than giving the kid
a national platform.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.922
So, what do we do now?

18:17.013 --> 18:19.595
You explain to your brother
that he overplayed his hand.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.014
Well, that won't
make any difference.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.887
The idiot thinks he's
doing the right thing.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.301
What if we convince
a court that his refusal

18:25.397 --> 18:27.558
is part of an underlying
psychiatric disorder?

18:27.816 --> 18:29.681
They assign a conservator,
we do what we want.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.392
Fraud? Great.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.526
Narcissistic
personality disorder.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.855
Both the leaking of the tape
and the refusal of treatment

18:36.992 --> 18:38.823
indicate that he has
no fear of consequences.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.322
FOREMAN: So instead
of defrauding the court,
you'll waste their time?

18:41.538 --> 18:44.871
No way a judge classifies
a personality disorder
as a mental illness.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.414
If a decorated
military officer,

18:46.501 --> 18:49.959
who happened to be
the patient's brother,
corroborates, they might.

18:51.214 --> 18:55.173
So you want me to sign
a piece of paper that
says my brother is crazy

18:55.260 --> 18:56.545
for doing what
he thinks is right?

18:56.636 --> 19:00.049
I want you to save his life.
His heart could
go at any time.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.679
He's a fool,
but he's not crazy.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.768
The patient is
refusing treatment
because of honor,

19:14.904 --> 19:18.032
and his brother is refusing
to be his conservator
because of honor.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.652
Good, Taub's
cured the patient.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.825
I had to go
to the bathroom.
Bathroom's that way.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.194
You just ran in
from that way.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.574
That one's been out
of order for two days.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.166
I had to go up
to the third floor.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.253
I'm not lying.
It's out of order.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.584
I believe you.
I'm going to fix it.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.631
We could treat
if he doesn't know
he's being treated.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.175
Lace his sponge bath?

19:39.262 --> 19:41.173
Would take too long
to reach his bloodstream.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.096
What ifwe
aerosolize steroids
and blast the room?

19:44.184 --> 19:45.970
Speaking of which.

19:48.271 --> 19:52.264
It'd be too hard
to get the prednisone
concentrations right.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.479
No one fixes anything
unless they have
a compelling reason.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.194
And if we're
going to treat,

20:00.575 --> 20:03.282
we have to give him
a compelling reason.

In two days,
youJIhave
all your answers.

20:20.637 --> 20:24.505
But the only way you'll live
long enough to get the truth
is by accepting treatment.

I don't trust the Army
to follow through on this.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.811

20:32.649 --> 20:35.106
I'll make sure
those pages get here.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.195
Selfishness
is apparently
honorable now.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.124
He wanted to create change,
instead he's just satisfying
his own curiosity.

20:53.211 --> 20:55.372
He's getting the truth.
Most he could hope for.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.203
I need to take a dump.

And if we start
you on treatment now,

then our tests accurate

yielded a false positive,

That could have
caused the vasospasm.

23:03.841 --> 23:07.959
And DIC could have been caused
by Bernard Soulier Syndrome.

23:09.097 --> 23:12.510
And you're sick
and you have to do
something about it.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.008
If we got a patient file
with the same symptoms
you're exhibiting...

23:15.186 --> 23:17.427
And the symptoms
I'm not exhibiting?

it's his business,
not Foreman's.

will put lives at risk.

24:08.156 --> 24:11.614
We tell Foreman, House
either agrees to treatment
or gets suspended.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.483
Which means House
gets suspended.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.201
And considering
House at 90%

24:15.455 --> 24:18.447
is better than
any other doctor at
this hospital at 100%,

24:18.541 --> 24:20.873
that means our patients
get a lower standard of care.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.123
House could be at 90%,
he could be at 60%.
We don't know.

24:24.213 --> 24:27.797
And until we do, there's
no reason to do anything
more than what we've done.

24:29.510 --> 24:30.499
(SIGHS)

24:33.514 --> 24:38.508
(LOUDLY) Blurry vision,
headache, bit of nausea
and dizziness.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.063
I am completely baffled.

24:41.648 --> 24:42.979
I only had
eight beers.

24:45.443 --> 24:46.933
Sophomore class
pong tournament's
in a week.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.438
I'm working on
my tolerance.

24:51.741 --> 24:55.825
Hop on one foot
and sing the
iCar/y theme song.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.990
Like you don't know it.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.788
(SIGHS)

25:03.753 --> 25:04.993
(SINGING)

25:13.471 --> 25:15.177
Damn it, man,
can't you see
I'm doctoring?

25:19.310 --> 25:22.222
If you want to talk
to me, you can buy me
a sandwich in an hour.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.601
Or I can just hover here
until you're done.

25:27.985 --> 25:32.069
Heard enough.
Just never could figure out
the "breathe air" part.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.771
Next year,
stick to whiskey.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.858
Or at least stay away
from week-old green beers.

25:36.953 --> 25:40.741
A lot less likely to contain
tartrazine-laced
green food dyes

25:40.832 --> 25:42.948
for which you apparently
have an intolerance.

25:43.459 --> 25:47.919
Once you break the seal,
should be out of
your system in 48 hours.

25:50.842 --> 25:55.461
What are my choices here?
If I tell you I'm fine,
you won't believe me.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.091
I've scheduled
a liver function test.

25:57.223 --> 26:01.136
If I ignore you,
then you'll just
ignore my ignoring.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.763
Which is rude, frankly.

26:02.854 --> 26:05.937
Depending on the results,
we'll customize
a treatment plan.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.815
If I tell you
I think I'm sick
and I need your help

26:09.902 --> 26:13.895
and we need to set up
a time to talk about it,
you'll just assume I'm lying.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.527
Again, rude.
Also hurtful.

26:16.659 --> 26:19.617
Why is it that you can
find the smallest thing
wrong with anyone else,

26:19.704 --> 26:20.864
but when it
comes to you...

26:20.955 --> 26:23.071
I really don't have
a choice here, do I?

26:23.166 --> 26:24.827
No. You don't.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.203
I'm on the list.
He's not.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.333
You can't
ignore me forever.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.082
Well, if you're right,
it's not gonna be
all that long.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.626
Do it slow.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.089
(SIGHS)

26:49.484 --> 26:50.519
Who are you?

26:52.361 --> 26:54.226
Well, considering
the only people
allowed in this room

26:54.489 --> 26:56.730
are your doctors
and your family,

26:57.658 --> 27:00.866
I'm your long-lost
cousin Ralph.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.864
So glad to
finally meet you.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.410
Are you going
to check on me?

27:07.210 --> 27:10.953
It's gonna be at least
two hours until we can tell
if the heparin's working.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.167
Then what are you
doing here?

27:13.382 --> 27:15.088
My father taught me

27:15.176 --> 27:19.260
that it's dishonorable
to interrupt someone
while they're reading.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.595
Honor is not
a punch line.

27:22.016 --> 27:23.472
Get out of my room.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.341
So, was it worth it?

27:28.981 --> 27:33.099
Best case, you spend
the rest of your life
in Leavenworth.

27:33.236 --> 27:35.978
Worst case,
you spend the rest
of your life here.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.773
Justice for 34 deaths
outweighs anything
the Army can do to me.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.609
They got justice?
Do they know that?

27:44.580 --> 27:47.572
What if only 10 people
had died? Four?

27:47.667 --> 27:49.203
Even one
civilian death is...

27:49.293 --> 27:52.376
What if they had just
maimed a few guys. Would
that have been worth it?

27:54.006 --> 27:56.292
My job was to
log that tape,

27:57.260 --> 27:59.501
get all the details
in the official record.

28:01.389 --> 28:03.880
After the 10th time
of watching it,

28:04.600 --> 28:06.306
I stopped trying
to convince myself

28:06.394 --> 28:09.056
that the shovel
could have been
mistaken for a gun

28:09.564 --> 28:11.976
because all I could see
were the victims' faces.

28:13.192 --> 28:17.731
All I was doing was trying
to read that kid's lips to
make out his last words.

28:19.991 --> 28:21.026
I couldn't sleep.

28:21.951 --> 28:22.986
Couldn't eat.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.445
Think I like
the cue ball look?

28:27.540 --> 28:30.122
My hair turned
gray in three days.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.959
My body was telling me
I had to do whatever I could

28:34.630 --> 28:38.589
to make sure that
something like this
never happened again.

28:42.305 --> 28:45.388
Your hair turned
gray in three days?

28:47.226 --> 28:51.970
Loss of hair color indicates
an autoimmune condition,
likely Graves disease.

28:52.523 --> 28:56.812
Hyperthyroidism leads to
a hypercoagulable state

28:57.320 --> 28:58.935
which causes thrombosis.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.527
Start him on
anti-thyroids.

29:00.615 --> 29:02.480
You want to reject
our current diagnosis

29:02.575 --> 29:05.066
because he had
a few gray hairs,

29:05.161 --> 29:07.493
panicked and
shaved his head?

29:07.622 --> 29:11.240
I want to reject our
current diagnosis because
I think we're wrong

29:11.334 --> 29:13.416
and treating for
wrong diagnoses

29:13.502 --> 29:15.333
can result in side
effects, like death.

29:15.463 --> 29:19.172
Even if he did fully go
gray, stress seems way
more likely than Graves.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.795
I haven't read
anyjournal articles
proving that veterans

29:21.886 --> 29:23.842
have a higher
incidence of
depigmentation.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.387
But, of course, that
could be the hepatic
encephalopathy talking.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.305
Our treatment
for Bernard Soulier
hasn't had...

29:28.476 --> 29:30.558
So you all want to just
ignore the new symptom?

29:30.728 --> 29:33.140
It's not Graves
because it's not
a symptom at all.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.766
And the anti-thyroids
you want

29:34.899 --> 29:37.686
could reduce
his blood pressure and
his ability to breathe,

29:37.777 --> 29:40.189
which could result in
side effects, like death.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.814
Small soda.

29:42.698 --> 29:46.031
Graves it is.
Start him on
anti-thyroids.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.912
I know we disagree
with House all the time,

29:52.083 --> 29:56.622
but before I could say,
"Okay, he's a genius."

29:56.712 --> 29:57.997
Now?

29:59.131 --> 30:02.373
Maybe he's just
really smart.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.966
We're not gonna give
him the anti-thyroids.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.859
Feeling okay?
Any better?

30:21.946 --> 30:23.186
Pretty good.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.067
He did just ask
me for a blanket.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.193
You're cold?

30:28.244 --> 30:29.279
A little.

30:29.829 --> 30:30.864
For how long?

30:31.831 --> 30:34.698
It's really nothing.
Maybe an hour or two.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.206
He's at 104.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.711
It's not Bernard Soulier.

30:50.808 --> 30:51.843
Bold move.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.927
You've gone from
speculating that I'm sick,
to acting like I'm dead.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.229
We acted like we don't
trust your judgment,

30:58.315 --> 31:00.476
because we don't
trust your judgment.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.691
Why don't you start by
not trusting your own?

31:02.820 --> 31:05.527
We did more blood work.
It's not Graves either.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.648
Talk to you
for a minute?

31:10.995 --> 31:12.701
Anything you
have to say to me,
you can say to them.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.279
It's only fair,
considering anything
they say to me,

31:15.374 --> 31:16.454
they also say to you.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.868
Jiggle your pockets.
Who's got the silver coins?

31:21.839 --> 31:24.205
Until you receive
a clean bill of health,

31:24.300 --> 31:26.336
I'll be authorizing
all treatment orders.

31:31.140 --> 31:35.349
I would say that
that was an incredibly
stupid mistake.

31:35.519 --> 31:38.511
But apparently I'd have
to clear that opinion
through Foreman first.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.183
White count is high,

31:40.733 --> 31:43.975
so all the infections
we ruled out when he came
in are back on the table.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.981
Legionnaires'?
Unlikely without pneumonia.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.653
HOUSE: Taub?

31:48.741 --> 31:50.823
LoyaHyissuesin
his personal life

31:50.910 --> 31:53.572
make sense if they cross over
into his professional one.

31:53.829 --> 31:56.696
l was hoping we
could get a diagnosis
before the witch-hunt.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.411
The patient's infection
is an inherently less
interesting puzzle

32:00.586 --> 32:02.247
than the stab wound
in my back.

32:02.379 --> 32:06.122
Fine. I told Foreman.
Can we move on now?

32:06.217 --> 32:07.206
What about dengue?

32:07.301 --> 32:08.882
Patient isn't
in enough pain.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.000
HOUSE: Nope!

32:10.387 --> 32:12.343
I don't mean about dengue,
I have no idea.

32:12.765 --> 32:15.757
Taub's only confessing
'cause he wants us to
focus on the patient.

32:16.185 --> 32:17.675
I told Foreman.

32:17.770 --> 32:18.805
Idid.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.932
The next person
to confess is fired.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.309
Or Spartacus.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.436
For clarification,
no one's getting fired.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.230
Who else has a pitch?

32:27.363 --> 32:29.695
And then there's Park?

32:30.866 --> 32:32.527
The only one who
didn't confess.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.366
And the same cowardice,

32:34.537 --> 32:37.370
that makes someone
unable to move out
of Mommy and Daddy's home,

32:37.456 --> 32:39.321
might also make
someone a tattletale.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.372
You threatened to fire
the next person who...

32:41.460 --> 32:43.371
And it's malaria.
No, it's not.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.253
The Army issues
anti-malaria medication.

32:46.382 --> 32:47.667
And has done
for 10 years.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.794
That's the equivalent
of 5,000 generations

32:49.885 --> 32:52.627
of the Afghan mosquito,
Anopheles gambiae.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.719
It's plenty long enough
to develop a resistance.

32:55.391 --> 32:58.098
Anopheles, by the way,
it's Greek for "useless".

32:58.727 --> 33:02.436
Cover for intra-abdominal
sepsis and treat
with antimalarials.

33:05.943 --> 33:08.229
And was I also right
that it was a stupid idea?

33:10.239 --> 33:12.070
We believe
you have malaria.

33:12.158 --> 33:13.523
These pills...

33:13.617 --> 33:16.233
I don't want
any medication.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.075
My dad's file
should've been here.

33:20.624 --> 33:24.082
Brant, I told you.
I looked into it.
There's just a delay.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.836
I believe that's what
the Army's saying.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.499
I don't believe
it's true.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.419
If they're not going to keep
their end of the bargain,

33:37.266 --> 33:38.255
neither am I.

33:43.981 --> 33:46.142
So, we got groped
for nothing?

33:46.275 --> 33:47.264
If he doesn't
want to stay alive...

33:47.359 --> 33:48.348
Hold on.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.146
Is it too late
to become
his conservator?

33:56.076 --> 33:58.067
I know what
I said before.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.902
Right now, I don't care.

34:00.915 --> 34:04.078
Of course not. We'll get
the papenNork drawn up.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.133
(DOOR OPENS)

34:19.975 --> 34:21.090
He changed his mind?

34:23.020 --> 34:24.055
VVhy?

34:24.188 --> 34:26.804
His brother's dying.
He needs a more
substantial reason?

34:26.941 --> 34:30.183
His brother was dying
the last time we asked him
to be the conservator.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.189
So instead of pushing
the issue with the Army
to get that file,

34:33.322 --> 34:35.688
he just decided to
give up on his code?

34:39.203 --> 34:40.613
Apparently.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.207
So, where do I sign?

34:49.588 --> 34:50.623
We don't need you to.

34:51.507 --> 34:54.499
The Army gave the file
to you yesterday.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.427
Major Mathewson
had another copy
sent over to us.

35:02.017 --> 35:06.386
Uh... You know, there's
a reason I didn't want
that file released.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.971
I know. I read it.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.478
I'm going to treat
my patient now.

35:22.079 --> 35:23.410
l was right.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.575
Wasn't I?

35:39.763 --> 35:41.344
How did he die?

35:42.391 --> 35:43.597
What did they cover up?

35:47.313 --> 35:48.723
They didn't
cover up anything.

35:52.609 --> 35:53.644
Idid.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.571
Dad died in that car accident
because he was drunk.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.816
Killed a pedestrian, too.

36:03.454 --> 36:05.866
What are you... I...

36:05.956 --> 36:09.369
He drank, Brant, a lot.
You were too young to see it.

36:15.549 --> 36:20.760
I had some of Dad's buddies
take care of his files.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.803
It's the only time
I ever broke the rules.

36:32.775 --> 36:33.810
I'm sorry.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.946
Can I begin treatment?

36:56.423 --> 36:57.663
TAUB: Fever hasn't broken.

36:57.758 --> 37:01.421
White count is still up,
renal function is declining.

37:01.512 --> 37:03.127
FOREMAN: So, he has
all the signs of malaria,

37:03.222 --> 37:05.213
except the antimalarials
aren't curing him.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.265
Gonorrhea?
If it got into
his heart...

37:08.352 --> 37:11.469
We did an echo.
His valves look good.
What about...

37:12.898 --> 37:13.978
You bastard.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.854
You were faking.

37:21.156 --> 37:24.114
Yesterday,
House stole candy by
putting it into a cup.

37:24.201 --> 37:27.068
The cup was too small,
so his solution was to
remove some of the candy.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.653
But the obviously
logical thing was to
just get a bigger cup,

37:29.748 --> 37:31.033
which he did today

37:31.250 --> 37:32.786
because he's
no longer faking.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.377
He couldn't have faked it.
We tested your...

37:34.461 --> 37:38.704
I took St. John's Wort
to alter the way my liver
metabolized acetaminophen.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.628
Then some N-acetylcysteine
just to finish it off.

37:42.719 --> 37:46.758
You tortured them to
torture me just to see
who you could trust?

37:47.349 --> 37:49.135
I did it to save lives.

37:50.686 --> 37:52.677
God, lwish I could
rationalize that one.

37:52.813 --> 37:56.021
And now you're gonna
brilliantly deduce which
one of us is the rat?

37:56.442 --> 37:58.103
What makes you think
I haven't already?

38:07.786 --> 38:11.745
To be continued. I need to
brilliantly cure a patient.

38:14.835 --> 38:17.668
No hair usually
means no lice.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.956
What we didn't account for
was that it wasn't your hair.

38:22.676 --> 38:26.385
Tea was not the only thing
that your Afghani neighbors
shared with you.

38:26.847 --> 38:29.509
I'm sure they were generous
enough to let you sit on
their furniture

38:29.600 --> 38:31.886
which was infested
with rat lice.

38:32.561 --> 38:33.596
You have typhus.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.222
Caused the vasculitis
and explains all your
other symptoms.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.811
But here's where
it gets interesting.

38:40.360 --> 38:44.899
One of those symptoms,
a lawyer might argue,
was leaking the tape.

38:45.491 --> 38:48.574
There are psychiatric issues
associated with typhus.

38:49.077 --> 38:53.366
And if you change your
mind, plead not guilty,
you've got a case.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.788
I'd be undermining
everything I've been
trying to do.

38:58.879 --> 39:03.043
You did what you
thought you had to do.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.383
Going to jail
proves nothing.

39:09.473 --> 39:11.464
It proves I still
have my honor.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.433
You're not doing
this for honor,

39:19.525 --> 39:21.516
you're doing this
to please your father.

39:22.611 --> 39:26.945
And the pathetic thing is,
is that the man you're trying
to please never existed.

39:45.634 --> 39:46.965
Traitor.

39:48.762 --> 39:51.094
You've been
avoiding me
for two days.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.551
Because when l stranded you
behind the barricades,

39:53.642 --> 39:54.882
you went straight
to Foreman.

39:54.977 --> 39:58.219
I've been avoiding you
because you're an ass.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.846
I've been
an ass my whole life.
I can't get rid of you.

40:00.941 --> 40:04.433
You can get rid of me now.
Just turn and limp away.

40:06.029 --> 40:07.018
Huh!

40:08.198 --> 40:11.531
Your whiny righteousness
has the stench of sincerity.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.996
Fine. I'll have to
punish my whole team,

40:15.080 --> 40:16.866
so one of them
will step forward.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.583
Makes sense.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.419
(SIGHS) Damn.
Now I'm gonna have to
punish my whole team

40:24.506 --> 40:25.962
so one of them
will step forward.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.300
You just said that.

40:27.426 --> 40:29.007
Yeah, but I
meant it this time.

40:30.804 --> 40:33.011
First time, I was
just testing you.

40:33.140 --> 40:36.632
Either you were gonna
genuinely confess or
falsely confess,

40:36.727 --> 40:38.388
or actually...

41:26.860 --> 41:28.225
(SQUEAKING)

41:29.738 --> 41:31.774
His name's Li'l Chase.

41:34.576 --> 41:35.907
He's a rat.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.744
You're a rat.
Get it?

41:43.460 --> 41:46.827
Taub confessed
to telling Foreman
to protect the patient.

41:46.922 --> 41:49.413
Adams confessed
to protect Taub.

41:49.925 --> 41:52.792
Your confession
was just piling on.

41:53.095 --> 41:55.177
There was no
rational reason for
you to have done it.

41:55.305 --> 41:58.172
And my punishment
will be nothing.

41:59.810 --> 42:01.346
You wanted me
to tell Foreman.

42:02.104 --> 42:04.891
Your ability to solve
puzzles is the only thing
that matters to you.

42:05.399 --> 42:08.436
And you're smart enough
to know even you'll lose
your edge at some point.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.526
You want to make sure
someone's there when you do.

42:15.575 --> 42:17.952
If that were true,

42:18.328 --> 42:21.411
why are Li'l Chase's
little cousins

42:22.332 --> 42:25.824
scurrying
through your apartment
floorboards right now?
