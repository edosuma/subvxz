WEBVTT

00:12.763 --> 00:16.225
Aniq, Aniq, Aniq, Aniq.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.144
Come out, wherever you are.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.480
I know you got your own agenda,

00:22.356 --> 00:23.649
and I got mine.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.195
But I'm on your side.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.490
You gotta trust me, Aniq,

00:32.366 --> 00:33.825
wherever you are.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.621
Hey, Cap. You're up late.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.373
Germain is landing in one hour.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.000
I need you to email him your report
before he lands.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.378
Well, actually, Cap,
we got one in the wind,

00:44.461 --> 00:46.630
and there was this party
that happened 15 years ago

00:46.713 --> 00:48.715
that I'm pretty sure is the motive
behind ev--

00:48.799 --> 00:50.050
You should've been done hours ago.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.844
-But I--
-This ends now, okay?

00:51.927 --> 00:53.846
It's not just your career
you're putting at risk.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.055
It's also your partner's!

00:55.138 --> 00:58.225
Come on. Leave the kid out of this, okay?

00:58.308 --> 01:00.018
Look, I know this is not my case, but--

01:00.102 --> 01:03.480
Promise me you'll press send
on the report in one hour.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.065
I promise I'll press send.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.153
After I solve this case.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.617
-Sorry, were you just talking to somebody?
-Were you talking to somebody?

01:16.451 --> 01:19.997
Okay. Please, please don't hate me,
but we still can't find Aniq.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.416
-What do you wanna do?
-What about Jennifer 2?

01:22.499 --> 01:25.252
The squad car just returned
from her house. There was no one there.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.088
Well, shit! We're running out of time.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.048
I need to find out about this party.

02:18.889 --> 02:23.852
All right, folks.
Let's take a little detour to 2006.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.855
Yeah! The year of the dog.

02:28.065 --> 02:31.777
Now, who wants to tell me what happened
at that Saint Patrick's Day party?

02:36.448 --> 02:37.658
I'll tell you.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.910
Timber!

02:40.577 --> 02:43.539
Knock it over. Pick it up.
That's what they say.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.123
Sorry, who are you?

02:45.207 --> 02:48.001
Walt is my name. Walt Butler.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.753
Oh, the butler.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.588
Walt, we're pretty low on ice.

02:51.672 --> 02:55.884
Seriously? We've literally
been together the whole night.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.890
And every time I see a zero

03:01.974 --> 03:04.726
I turn it to a heart in my head

03:04.810 --> 03:05.811
Heart in my…

03:07.688 --> 03:08.647
I poured you a shot.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.940
Two shots.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.151
Extra ice.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.778
So I was wondering what it's like…

03:14.862 --> 03:16.363
I was in the car with you!

03:16.446 --> 03:17.656
I'll kill all of ya!

03:18.490 --> 03:20.409
Is that Brett? Hey, Brett.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.910
You guys don't remember any of that?

03:21.994 --> 03:23.078
No.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.539
Yeah! Come on.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.416
-Walt, is it?
-Yes.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.543
You were at that party 15 years ago?

03:29.626 --> 03:32.796
Light bulb moment.
It was my party in my house.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.756
Oh, no. I've never been to your house.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.216
I saw you in my house.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.509
Where have you been?

03:38.010 --> 03:42.472
I was-- I was just--
I was napping under some coats in a room.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.725
What did I miss?

03:45.809 --> 03:47.895
Well, this gentleman here
was just telling me

03:47.978 --> 03:50.981
about that Saint Patrick's Day party
15 years ago.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.193
Oh, yeah.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.030
I just wanted to throw you a party
that touched your soul, you know?

03:58.113 --> 03:59.740
Just wanted to celebrate Saint Patrick

03:59.823 --> 04:03.243
and get messed ass up
on some damn ass booze.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.578
What?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.206
-Come on, let's go.
-No!

04:07.289 --> 04:10.000
Sorry.
I want to tell everybody right here.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.919
Yeah, honey. Tell it, baby. Tell it.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.086
Okay, one second.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.881
Saint Patrick's Day, 2006.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.048
Okay.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.093
Saint Patrick's Day, 2006.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.971
My God. The time of velour jumpsuits.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.056
Britney and K-Fed.

04:24.139 --> 04:28.227
And I'd started making honey
that year as a hobby.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.896
Damn, there was a buzz in the air
that morning.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.774
College acceptances, our futures,

04:34.608 --> 04:37.236
and best of all,
my parents were out of town.

04:37.319 --> 04:41.031
I turn to my lab partner, Brett, I say,
"Spread the word. We're having a party."

04:44.701 --> 04:47.663
Tonight's party is gonna
blow people's minds.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.581
Dude, who are you talking to?

04:50.791 --> 04:51.959
You do the Latin homework?

04:52.626 --> 04:56.296
No. You think Berkeley gives a fart
about our Latin homework?

04:56.380 --> 04:58.632
Dude, you got into Stanford.
You don't have to do shit anymore.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.051
Watch this. Get out of here!

05:01.635 --> 05:03.762
-I mean, I did work hard on it, so…
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:15.399 --> 05:19.736
Oh, my God. Look at Eugene,
thinking he's a pimp with his new car.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.618
Come on.
I mean, money can buy you a lot of things,

05:26.702 --> 05:28.579
but coolness is not one of 'em.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.664
This is absolutely my fault.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.751
I told him if we wanna take our band to
the next level, we have to up our image.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.463
-Why does his license plate say "Xavier"?
-Xavier is his middle name.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.008
I, by mistake,
told him it sounded alternative.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.844
-Why would you do that?
-I don't know. I regret it immediately.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.513
I don't understand why you choose
to play music with this guy.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.975
By the way, he gave me his new demo.
It is hot pop garbage.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.311
Honestly, maybe you should do
your own thing.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.354
I mean, you guys are just so different.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.898
I know. That's what I've been saying.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.692
But I cannot find the right moment
to tell him we need to go solo.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.945
By the way, I'm almost certain
he thinks you took his spot at Stanford.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.406
-I know.
-Guys.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.158
Hey, guys, wait up!

06:06.909 --> 06:08.911
Did you notice my new whip?

06:08.994 --> 06:10.078
Yeah. Yeah, it's--

06:10.162 --> 06:11.163
My dad got it for me.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.707
He wanted to congratulate me
on getting wait-listed at Stanford.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.877
You know, he says it's really hard for
children of alumni to get in these days.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.713
They save so many spots
for scholarship kids and stuff, so…

06:19.796 --> 06:21.089
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.383
Must be tough to be
a child of privilege, huh, Eugene?

06:23.467 --> 06:26.970
Yeah, actually, I'm going by Xavier now.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.555
Is that so?

06:31.475 --> 06:32.935
See the license plate?

06:33.018 --> 06:35.479
-Yeah!
-Yeah! That's 'cause of you, man!

06:36.438 --> 06:39.441
Now that I've gotten into Stanford,
I'm filled with this new confidence.

06:39.525 --> 06:42.444
I might tell Zoë how I feel about her
tonight at the party.

06:42.528 --> 06:46.073
Yes. It's like I always say,
you get one shot in life.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.450
-You do always say that.
-I'm saying it all the time now.

06:48.534 --> 06:52.746
So, I said, "No, I'm not wearing green,
'cause I wanna get pinched by you, girl."

06:53.413 --> 06:54.581
That's so funny.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.626
Hey, man, you need to, like, loosen up.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.878
There's a party tonight,
and it's gonna be fun.

06:59.962 --> 07:00.963
Who cares?

07:02.172 --> 07:03.257
Nothing matters anymore.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.342
Chelsea's gonna go off
and live this incredible life,

07:05.425 --> 07:06.510
and what am I gonna do?

07:06.593 --> 07:07.594
"What am I gonna do?"

07:07.678 --> 07:09.429
You are Ned freaking Conway!

07:09.513 --> 07:12.266
Every girl's been wanting to get with you
since freshman year.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.560
You can have 'em, dude.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.981
I, on the other hand,
have my eyes on someone else.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.900
I know what's gonna cheer you up.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.111
I'm going long.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.237
I'm open! Hit me!

07:27.739 --> 07:30.576
Sorry. I didn't see you there, dude.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.077
-Walt.
-Cool.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.123
-…and also like, like--
-Hey, guys.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.125
-Oh, my God, Chelsea.
-Hey.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.502
-We heard about Ned. Are you okay?
-Hey.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.255
Such a bummer. I'm okay.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.631
It's just-- I mean, he was, like,

07:44.715 --> 07:46.675
the most popular guy
in high school, right?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.844
I just can't believe that
you broke up with him.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.137
So hot.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.307
You know, we've just been moving
in different directions for a while.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.934
And now we're literally moving
to different cities.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.060
Oh, my God, college.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.188
So I just thought it would be better now.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.939
You guys, there is a party tonight,

08:01.023 --> 08:04.943
and Ned will definitely be there,
and it is gonna be super weird.

08:05.027 --> 08:08.739
Are you-- I feel sad
and a little sick, like--

08:08.822 --> 08:10.157
You know, another thing is, like,

08:10.240 --> 08:13.619
tonight we could kind of pretend that
it's not about you guys.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.162
No, we're fine.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.413
-No, 100%.
-Not-- Yes.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.458
-I mean, it's mostly not about us.
-It's your thing and-- It's not.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.753
-And we'll be fine.
-Totally. Totally. Totally. I just…

08:22.836 --> 08:24.505
I do really feel sad for Ned.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.549
-And of course, you too. Of course.
-Thanks. Yeah.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.261
I suddenly kind of lost my appetite, so…

08:32.304 --> 08:33.304
Chelsea.

08:36.433 --> 08:40.062
You guys really didn't have to be
that mean to her.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.522
I thought she was being mean to me.

08:41.605 --> 08:45.067
-Anyway, where even is this party tonight?
-Brett told me…

08:45.150 --> 08:47.778
-I have no idea.
-…it's at his uncle's house, I think.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.113
It's actually at my house.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.616
Eavesdrop much?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.993
-We're having a conversation.
-Sorry.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.578
-I feel so violated.
-What?

08:56.662 --> 08:58.163
-That dude is weird.
-Does he go here?

08:58.247 --> 09:00.541
Hey, give him some eyelashes,
maybe mascara.

09:00.624 --> 09:03.627
-Do you want me to do that on your face?
-Yeah. I mean, please.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.463
You're so pretty.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.507
Zoë, thank you for making me gorgeous.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.633
Aniq, any time.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.011
Oh, my God! Wait, I want them.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.597
-You want them? All right, let's see.
-Yeah! Okay.

09:15.681 --> 09:18.517
I don't have as deft an artist's hand
as you, but…

09:19.560 --> 09:23.230
I didn't think it was possible,
but you're even more gorgeous.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.523
-Look at that.
-Thanks.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.402
-Ask her out. Ask her out.
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.738
Hey. Are you…

09:32.739 --> 09:36.034
Are you going
to that party at, I think, like--

09:36.118 --> 09:38.453
what is it, at Brett's house tonight?

09:38.537 --> 09:41.999
Yeah. I was actually gonna ask you,
do you wanna maybe, like, meet up there--

09:42.082 --> 09:44.459
-Yes! Together. Yes, I do.
-…together? Or some--

09:45.043 --> 09:46.837
-Cool.
-Cool.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.592
"Maybe meet up there together?"

09:51.675 --> 09:54.052
-Did you hear that?
-"Wanna maybe go together?"

09:54.136 --> 09:56.597
If you wanna close the deal,
all you have to do--

09:56.680 --> 09:58.932
Create a lovingly curated mix CD
that expresses how I feel about her.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.726
-Yes. And then you win.
-Right? Boom!

10:05.439 --> 10:07.941
Damn, Zoë. You're looking fine today.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.401
Makes me wanna…

10:10.485 --> 10:12.654
Oh, my God.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.323
-What?
-What happened?

10:14.406 --> 10:15.782
Is that a joke?

10:15.866 --> 10:16.909
I mean,

10:16.992 --> 10:20.162
-I was pretending that I had an orgasm.
-Cool.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.538
Was that yeast?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.707
-Yeah, it was yeast. Carbon dioxide.
-Yeah, I can hear it.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.209
Do you want me to get you a paper towel?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.960
-Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, bro.
-Sorry about all--

10:27.044 --> 10:28.670
-No, thank you.
-Sorry about getting in the way.

10:28.754 --> 10:29.796
No, no. Thanks, man.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.131
I'm cross-faded.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.342
What's cross-faded?
Two different substances?

10:33.425 --> 10:35.385
Like, drunk and high, you silly.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.179
I don't know what to do with you.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.556
Hey! Welcome to my party
and my house. There's pizza.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.808
If you don't like pizza,
I can heat you up some stew.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.019
-Do you want some stew?
-Hi! No, thank you.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.522
You don't? Okay. Cool. And hey.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.148
I just had a great talk with Zoë.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.776
-Yasper, hey!
-Zoë, hey!

10:50.859 --> 10:52.861
Is Aniq here yet?

10:52.945 --> 10:53.946
No. But you know what?

10:54.029 --> 10:55.906
He just talked to me.
He's gonna be here any minute.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.199
Cool!

10:57.282 --> 11:00.035
Okay. Well, when you see him,
tell him to come find me?

11:00.118 --> 11:03.455
Yes, of course! You kidding me?
Good to see you.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.171
-Hey.
-Where are you? Zoë is here.

11:11.255 --> 11:13.590
She was asking about you.
She literally just said, about you,

11:13.674 --> 11:15.384
to "tell him to come find me."

11:15.467 --> 11:17.594
-Really?
-You gotta get here right now.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.513
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'm almost done.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.390
This mix has to be perfect.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.809
And guess what?
I encoded a hidden message.

11:23.892 --> 11:30.566
The first letter of each song spells out
A-N-I-Q, heart, E-O-Z, so--

11:30.649 --> 11:32.860
God, you're wasting my minutes!
What are you talking about?

11:32.943 --> 11:35.487
Get those beautiful thighs
and that nimble tongue over here

11:35.571 --> 11:37.364
right now, or you're gonna miss your shot.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.408
-At least appreciate-- Okay. I'm coming.
-Okay, bye!

11:42.995 --> 11:43.871
What is it?

11:55.799 --> 11:57.217
Room for one more?

11:57.301 --> 11:58.427
Hey.

11:59.344 --> 12:02.848
-Okay. So, promise you won't tell anyone?
-Yeah.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.100
The Jennifers are bitches.

12:05.184 --> 12:07.728
Oh, God. They are such assholes.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.813
They're just jealous
of how cool you came off

12:09.897 --> 12:12.065
for, like, making choices for yourself.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.651
So, I am really proud of you, Chelsea.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.738
I really don't wanna hurt him
or anybody, you know.

12:17.821 --> 12:21.074
-I'm just trying to figure out who I am.
-Totally.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.911
You're the only person I feel comfortable
talking to about it.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.329
Which is so weird,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.789
because everybody seems so comfortable
talking about me.

12:27.873 --> 12:34.254
F them. Okay, it is time
for Fun Zoë to take the reins.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.340
Okay, what is up?

12:36.423 --> 12:39.259
-Turn that frown upside down.
-Yes.

12:39.343 --> 12:40.511
Flip the frown.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.678
I didn't know you were bad.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.598
So, there's gotta be, like,
someone here you're into.

12:44.681 --> 12:45.974
No. No. None of the guys

12:46.058 --> 12:48.977
or, frankly, the girls here are my type.

12:49.061 --> 12:52.022
-Well, then that is what college is for.
-Yes.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.192
Same mistakes, just with new people.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.360
-Amen.
-Same--

13:01.573 --> 13:02.574
No.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.035
Wait, Zoë. So, tell me about Brett.
What is going on?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.620
There is nothing going on.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.747
-Come on.
-He is such a player.

13:08.830 --> 13:09.831
Who's a player?

13:11.333 --> 13:12.835
You guys talking about me?

13:12.918 --> 13:15.045
Think you guys were talking about
my butt maybe.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.005
Maybe.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.095
Green pool. The pool is green.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.429
Why is the pool guy here?

13:25.514 --> 13:26.890
Why does it say "Malt?"

13:26.974 --> 13:30.102
No. "Malt"? Damn it.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.020
Ready.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.188
Okay, okay.

13:37.568 --> 13:38.861
Yasper!

13:38.944 --> 13:42.322
How great is this party?

13:42.406 --> 13:43.490
Right?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.285
Hey, what's up? You okay?

13:46.368 --> 13:47.870
You bleached your hair?

13:47.953 --> 13:50.914
Yeah! Yeah. It's not bleached actually.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.916
-It's called chard--
-Cool. Cool.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.544
Listen, you and I have had
some incredible moments together, right?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.171
We've made some incredible things.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.007
But the truth is, pop is just a fad, dude.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.675
Ska is forever.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.803
And look at you. Look how you're dressed.
You're pop from top to bottom.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.930
You can't do this in those clothes.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.932
Dude, we obviously just want
two different things.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.392
I don't…

14:11.476 --> 14:15.063
Hey, but I think…
I think we've gotta break up the band.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.024
You-- What?

14:18.609 --> 14:19.610
I'm gonna go solo.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.528
So, like just you?

14:21.612 --> 14:24.072
Aniq was right.
Our vibes are just way too different.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.074
Wai-- Aniq said that?

14:26.158 --> 14:28.827
But listen, promise me
we'll remain friends. Okay?

14:28.911 --> 14:30.287
Because this means too much. Okay?

14:31.622 --> 14:33.874
We're gonna be friends forever.
All right, brother.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.675
Yes. "Walt."

14:47.137 --> 14:49.014
Eugene? Okay.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.225
You seen Zoë anywhere?

14:51.308 --> 14:53.393
I made her a little-- Whatever.

14:53.477 --> 14:56.313
There's, like, so many people, honestly.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.859
This is all your fault!

15:04.404 --> 15:05.405
Damn it.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.997
-What the hell?
-What the hell, you!

15:14.081 --> 15:15.707
-You think this is funny?
-Stay out of my--

15:15.791 --> 15:17.376
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

15:19.795 --> 15:21.713
That was-- Oh, God! That was--

15:21.797 --> 15:25.592
-Wait, what happened? Who was that?
-I think some loser fell in the pool.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.929
Speaking of losers-- Hey, quick question.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.434
Mr. Tiny Pee-pee Penis.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.103
This is a new jacket!

15:38.397 --> 15:40.524
Come on. Come on. Please, please, please!

15:42.693 --> 15:43.819
Just--

15:43.902 --> 15:47.281
Someone's in here. I'm puking!

15:47.364 --> 15:49.199
It's coming out both ends actually.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.827
No. Sorry.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.872
I saw what Eugene did to you back there.

15:54.955 --> 15:59.418
And I may be to blame
for the festive water. Green.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.545
Anyway, I brought you these.

16:02.296 --> 16:04.715
You usually bring
a change of clothes to a house party?

16:04.798 --> 16:06.967
This is my house.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.012
Yet this is the only shirt you could find?

16:10.095 --> 16:13.348
Oh, yeah. My weird little brother's
your size, so…

16:13.432 --> 16:15.100
Okay. Well, thank you. Thanks.

16:15.184 --> 16:18.312
So, you think people are having fun or--

16:18.395 --> 16:19.396
I mean, yeah.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.357
I just want people to have fun
so maybe they'll notice me

16:22.441 --> 16:25.736
or remember my name, you know.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.866
-You know, I know how you feel.
-Yeah?

16:30.949 --> 16:32.784
But, you know,
we've gotta put ourselves out there.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.746
You know, I had a door open with someone.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.124
So I made this mix CD, you know.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.169
It says everything I wanna say to her
but don't know how.

16:42.878 --> 16:46.590
That's why I've gotta salvage this thing
before that door closes.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.674
Hey.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.179
Just some advice about…

16:59.019 --> 17:00.312
No. No, no!

17:01.355 --> 17:02.648
Thanks so much for this party.

17:04.525 --> 17:05.733
You're welcome.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.906
So, I heard a rumor that you're going
to RISD next year. Is that right?

17:10.989 --> 17:11.949
Yeah.

17:13.407 --> 17:16.828
I guess I should tell you that
I'm gonna be your neighbor next year.

17:16.912 --> 17:17.913
What do you mean?

17:19.330 --> 17:22.291
I mean, I got a squash scholarship
to Brown, and I'm going.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.505
-Wait. Get out! Are you serious?
-No. Yes.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.674
So, we're both gonna be
in Providence next year?

17:28.757 --> 17:29.758
Yes.

17:29.842 --> 17:33.178
-Oh, my God! Congratulations!
-I know, right?

17:42.437 --> 17:43.981
-Hey.
-Hey!

17:44.064 --> 17:45.065
Hey.

17:46.692 --> 17:49.111
Look at that hair. I like it, Eugene.

17:49.194 --> 17:52.114
Thanks. And I'm going by Xavier now.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.866
-Why Xavier?
-It's just, like, sort of

17:53.949 --> 17:55.617
a persona that I'm trying to create.

17:55.701 --> 18:00.372
And you are doing it. Look at that look.
That's a look.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.083
That is a very, very cool jacket.
Aren't you hot?

18:04.835 --> 18:06.712
Yeah, no, I'm just, like-- I don't know.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.881
I wanna, like, do something with my life.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.465
-You know?
-Totally.

18:10.549 --> 18:12.426
I just, like-- I think about--

18:12.509 --> 18:14.803
I think about when I'm onstage
in the school plays

18:14.887 --> 18:17.973
as Mr. MacAfee, as Cornelius Hackl.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.933
-The crowd goes wild, right?
-Right.

18:20.017 --> 18:23.896
But surprise. It's still me.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.272
-Yes.
-Yeah.

18:25.355 --> 18:28.025
So, like, Eugene is
who everyone else thinks I am.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.110
But Xavier is who I really am.

18:30.194 --> 18:33.030
Wow. You got a lot going on.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.531
Yeah, it's deep.

18:35.032 --> 18:38.744
And also now, like, my band, Ska-pe Diem,
it's, like, over.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.663
Yasper, he just, like--
He was like, "I wanna do my own thing,"

18:41.747 --> 18:45.417
and, like, saying we're, like, growing
in different directions or whatever and…

18:46.376 --> 18:47.878
-I don't…
-Oh, my God.

18:47.961 --> 18:51.715
I just said
those exact words to Ned last night.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.968
It's just funny that we're both
going through breakups, kind of.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.512
-I guess so.
-In a way.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.764
Yeah. It's, like, no fun.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.850
It sucks. But I just learned
this, like, sort of cure,

19:01.934 --> 19:05.437
-which is that you take alcohol…
-Uh-huh.

19:05.521 --> 19:09.983
…and you put it in your body
until you can't fit any more in.

19:10.776 --> 19:11.860
Uh-huh.

19:11.944 --> 19:14.321
-Yeah. I heard that too.
-I think that's…

19:14.404 --> 19:16.532
-We should get hella faded.
-…what needs to happen.

19:16.615 --> 19:20.369
-Yes. Let's go. Hello.
-I think that's smart. All right. Yeah.

19:20.452 --> 19:22.579
You know,
it is pretty cool of Brett's uncle

19:22.663 --> 19:25.791
to let us use his house while he's on,
like, his second tour in Kosovo.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.251
-It's crazy.
-No!

19:30.921 --> 19:33.131
Sorry. Cups?

19:34.007 --> 19:36.051
-Okay, what?
-What?

19:36.134 --> 19:37.219
What is that guy's deal?

19:37.302 --> 19:39.137
But I'm kind of, like, a sensitive softy.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.389
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.058
Like, if I think about my grandparents,
I get, like, the blues.

19:43.141 --> 19:46.395
-You lost your grandparents?
-No, they're fine. I just love 'em.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.230
Yeah.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.442
Aniq. I was looking for you earlier.

19:52.526 --> 19:55.404
You-- I couldn't find you.
We were supposed to meet up hours ago.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.155
It's… Long story, but I can--

19:57.239 --> 19:59.074
But it's totally fine
because I ran into Brett,

19:59.157 --> 20:02.160
and he told me that we're both
gonna be in Rhode Island this fall.

20:02.244 --> 20:06.415
And he's gonna have a car.
So that's gonna be so helpful.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.041
Cars are super useful.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.294
You know, for, like, roads and stu--
Actually, I ma--

20:10.377 --> 20:14.464
Yeah. I'm just really happy to, like,
have someone I know there.

20:15.424 --> 20:16.717
I think most nights are gonna end

20:16.800 --> 20:18.719
with us getting some, like,
late-night treats

20:18.802 --> 20:20.304
-at Louees.
-Louees!

20:20.387 --> 20:22.347
I cannot wait. I cannot wait.

20:22.431 --> 20:24.808
-It's this diner. It's open 24 hours.
-Twenty-four hours. Yeah.

20:24.892 --> 20:28.520
Hey, are you okay?
You seem, like, a little off.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.606
I'm great, actually. I just--

20:30.689 --> 20:34.151
There was just something I realized I was
supposed-- gonna do, but it's too late.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.195
So I'm gonna check out
what Yasper's up to.

20:36.278 --> 20:39.239
You guys-- Yeah, you guys have fun.
Keep, you know--

20:39.323 --> 20:40.324
Sorry.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.576
I'm gonna-- I'll see ya.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.411
Yeah, I'll see you guys.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.998
Everyone thinks it's bleach,
but it's actually a color.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.791
Chardonnay. Yeah.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.336
Well, cheers to chardonnay.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.296
Thank you. Yeah, chardonnay all day.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.632
You know what?

20:56.715 --> 20:58.258
I actually need to slow down.

20:58.342 --> 20:59.343
-Yeah? Okay.
-Yeah.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.386
I'll whip us up, like,
a quick water course?

21:01.470 --> 21:03.180
-Yeah. That would be good.
-Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.681
-Coming up. Coming up.
-Wow.

21:04.765 --> 21:05.807
Here we go.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.392
-My head is spinning. I feel--
-Agua.

21:07.476 --> 21:09.728
Gosh. Wow. Okay. Sorry.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.980
-I think I need to lie down.
-Yeah. Okay.

21:12.064 --> 21:14.149
-Can you give me a hand?
-You want me to give--

21:14.233 --> 21:17.569
-Yeah. Yes, I-- Yeah, I just need help.
-Oka-- Yeah. Okay.

21:17.653 --> 21:20.697
-Okay. All right. All right.
-All right. Yeah.

21:20.781 --> 21:23.825
No, now that you mention it,
lying down, like, sounds pretty tight.

21:23.909 --> 21:27.621
-I think the bedroom is right up here.
-I could use it.

21:29.081 --> 21:30.457
Chelsea?

21:30.541 --> 21:31.667
Okay. It's okay.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.418
-Excuse us.
-Sorry.

21:33.502 --> 21:34.628
Yes.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.464
-Okay, Ned, look away. Look away!
-Oh, God.

21:37.548 --> 21:38.882
You shouldn't have to see that.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.177
Assholes don't deserve
what you've done for them.

21:42.261 --> 21:47.432
You've given them your house, your pool,
your dad's vintage wine collection,

21:47.516 --> 21:51.019
your friendship, some popcorn.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.440
Hey, did you see that guy streaking?

21:56.191 --> 22:00.070
Damn, that was the coolest thing
I've seen so far in my life.

22:00.571 --> 22:02.072
'Cause I saw his ass.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.157
Man, I love that guy because of that.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.325
Wasn't that his party?

22:05.409 --> 22:07.870
Yeah. It was the greatest party ever.

22:12.207 --> 22:13.876
-There's a carpet.
-Okay.

22:13.959 --> 22:16.128
-Rug on top of the carpet.
-Oh, my God. Brett's uncle is rich.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.504
-Careful. Careful.
-I didn't know.

22:17.588 --> 22:21.842
-And we made it.
-Okay.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.888
Things are just drunk when you're hard.

22:27.556 --> 22:28.599
I--

22:29.391 --> 22:30.767
I didn't mean that.

22:30.851 --> 22:33.979
You maybe did. You maybe did.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.731
I don't know what it means, so…

22:40.527 --> 22:42.654
Sorry. What are you doing?

22:44.531 --> 22:45.532
Kissing you.

22:46.533 --> 22:50.162
'Cause I-- Well, I know
Eugene would never do anything like this,

22:50.245 --> 22:53.123
but Xavier's here.

22:53.207 --> 22:56.710
Okay, I just met Xavier and, like, Eugene,

22:57.336 --> 23:02.716
it's sort of the first time
we ever spoke this long, you know?

23:02.799 --> 23:04.343
-I just…
-But--

23:05.260 --> 23:07.638
I'm really drunk.

23:08.138 --> 23:10.098
I'm really drunk.

23:10.182 --> 23:11.391
Okay, so we're drunk.

23:11.475 --> 23:12.768
I just didn't…

23:13.727 --> 23:15.020
I didn't mean for it like this.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.856
I don't know-- Like, were you--
You were just, like, leading me on or…

23:17.940 --> 23:19.316
How was I leading you on?

23:19.399 --> 23:22.444
Well, you said
you liked my jacket and my hair.

23:22.528 --> 23:24.404
I liked the jacket! Who cares?

23:24.488 --> 23:27.241
-Okay, fine. Fine. Fine.
-It's not, like, a promise.

23:27.324 --> 23:31.286
And, you know, okay,
so you bleached your hair--

23:31.370 --> 23:33.872
Chardonnay! It's--

23:34.831 --> 23:36.083
It's chardon--

23:40.879 --> 23:42.214
Whoa, man.

23:42.297 --> 23:43.757
What happened in there?

23:43.841 --> 23:45.300
Did you hook up with Chelsea?

23:49.555 --> 23:51.431
Yeah, w-- Yeah, we boned.

23:52.683 --> 23:53.684
Touchdown!

23:54.726 --> 23:57.855
Yeah, she was, like,
all over me, and I was, like,

23:58.647 --> 24:01.149
"Yeah, like, you're, like, an animal."

24:01.233 --> 24:03.652
And, yeah, it was, like--

24:04.611 --> 24:06.363
Holy shit.

24:06.446 --> 24:10.033
Chelsea and Eugene just had
a three-way with some total stranger!

24:11.869 --> 24:14.121
Walt. Walt.

24:15.873 --> 24:17.124
Yeah, I did a three-way.

24:17.207 --> 24:18.458
I did a three-way!

24:22.546 --> 24:25.299
Yeah! Yeah!

24:27.009 --> 24:30.262
Dumbass Eugene. This is all his fault.

24:30.345 --> 24:31.346
Okay, you know what?

24:31.430 --> 24:34.600
Let's not play the blame game, all right?
He's had a weird night as well.

24:35.767 --> 24:36.810
Okay.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.812
Let's take it slow.

24:38.896 --> 24:41.523
Big bubbles. Those are big bubbles.
Make them tiny.

24:46.361 --> 24:47.404
You okay?

24:49.740 --> 24:51.783
It's a locked-up bird!

25:05.172 --> 25:07.216
Yeah, we were, like, fully butt naked.

25:07.299 --> 25:10.427
Except I was wearing
Brett's uncle's Purple Heart from Kosovo.

25:10.511 --> 25:12.513
-Brett's uncle.
-Yeah, it was chill.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.681
It was, like, almost patriotic, you know?

25:21.855 --> 25:23.482
What is going on?

25:26.485 --> 25:28.028
There she is.

25:28.612 --> 25:31.615
Hey, you ho-bag.
I heard you had sex with Eugene.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.826
Oh, my God. What are you saying? Shut up.

25:34.910 --> 25:38.914
You shut up. You shut your lying,
Monica Lewinsky mouth.

25:38.997 --> 25:42.125
You stand here,
in front of a jury of your peers,

25:42.209 --> 25:45.170
and you try and tell me you didn't
just hook up with Eugene

25:45.254 --> 25:47.422
-in front of all the most important…
-Oh, my God.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.424
-What-- Oh, no.
-…people in your life, Chelsea.

25:49.508 --> 25:53.011
I swear to God, you've been
so freaking weird over the past few weeks.

25:53.095 --> 25:55.556
Like you didn't come with me
to apply to Abercrombie

25:55.639 --> 25:57.599
like you promised on our 18th birthday.

25:57.683 --> 25:59.893
This is what I told you
I was worried about at lunch,

25:59.977 --> 26:02.020
except so much grosser,
'cause it's freaking Eugene.

26:02.104 --> 26:04.773
-Jennifer, that is not what happened.
-You know what's the worst part?

26:04.857 --> 26:09.194
The worst part is what this is doing
to Ned, because he's freaking devastated.

26:10.404 --> 26:14.074
Oh, yeah.
He looks really heartbroken, Jennifer.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.118
Listen--

26:19.580 --> 26:23.417
-My face and my boobs.
-Oh, my God.

26:24.418 --> 26:25.836
I'm so sorry.

26:28.297 --> 26:31.633
You guys, this is so embarrassing for her.

26:32.217 --> 26:37.764
Oh, God. Okay. Geez. All right.

26:41.101 --> 26:44.980
It's all over her dress.
It's kinda making me wanna vom.

26:46.481 --> 26:47.482
Wait.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.986
Brett, did you make me a mix CD?

26:52.029 --> 26:54.740
Yeah, no, I-- I made this for you.

26:54.823 --> 26:55.866
Really?

26:55.949 --> 26:59.995
Yeah. Just a bunch of songs
that kinda remind me of you.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.373
I feel like you do this for all the girls.

27:03.457 --> 27:06.293
No, no. It's actually the first time
I ever made one.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.794
Well, what songs are on it?

27:10.672 --> 27:12.049
Surprise.

27:13.175 --> 27:16.220
-Well, let's pop it in.
-Yeah. Yeah. Right there.

27:16.303 --> 27:17.304
-Yeah.
-Yeah, totally.

27:17.387 --> 27:18.972
-Oh, my God. I'm excited.
-Yeah.

27:19.056 --> 27:21.350
Please don't suck. Please don't suck.

27:21.433 --> 27:22.434
Don't suck.

27:26.063 --> 27:27.064
Hey--

27:29.358 --> 27:32.236
This is my favorite song.
How did you know that?

27:32.319 --> 27:33.779
Because I'm a player.

27:36.073 --> 27:37.908
With dance moves.

27:39.076 --> 27:40.244
God, I love this song.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.704
-Me too-- Sorry.
-Oh, my--

27:44.373 --> 27:45.249
-Yeah.
-Oh, man.

27:46.124 --> 27:48.252
I can't wait to listen
to the rest of the CD.

27:48.335 --> 27:49.711
Me too.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.880
I can't wait for you
to hear the rest of it.

27:51.964 --> 27:53.465
'Cause I know the songs.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.133
-Cool.
-Yeah.

27:56.218 --> 27:57.219
Yasper.

27:58.554 --> 27:59.805
What are the odds?

27:59.888 --> 28:00.931
Of what?

28:01.014 --> 28:03.767
-This is Zoë's favorite song.
-That's crazy.

28:03.851 --> 28:05.102
This is a sign.

28:06.144 --> 28:07.396
Good.

28:07.479 --> 28:09.356
Good. You're drunk, dude.

28:10.065 --> 28:11.733
Stay away from me, Eugene.

28:11.817 --> 28:14.319
It's Xavier. Hey, not sure if you noticed,

28:14.403 --> 28:17.614
but Brett's eating
your girl's face in there.

28:18.115 --> 28:20.868
Yeah, I guess if you hadn't slipped
and fallen in the pool,

28:20.951 --> 28:22.369
that would be you right now.

28:25.706 --> 28:26.707
Eugene.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.085
Don't listen to him, man.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.004
You okay, dude?

28:34.256 --> 28:36.300
Aniq. Aniq.

28:36.383 --> 28:37.843
High school.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.930
Why are you wearing a robe?

28:45.976 --> 28:47.144
Oh, shit.

28:48.812 --> 28:49.813
Aniq?

28:49.897 --> 28:51.106
No--

29:00.073 --> 29:01.658
Aniq, what are you doing?

29:01.742 --> 29:03.452
Buddy? Hey, bud?

29:04.036 --> 29:06.371
Hey, buddy? Aniq, don't!

29:06.455 --> 29:07.581
Dude, calm down.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.541
-No, no, no. Wait, no.
-Aniq.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.668
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Brett!

29:14.213 --> 29:15.088
Oh, shit!

29:17.674 --> 29:20.511
-Oh, my God. Make him stop.
-It's all right. Let him. It's not my car.

29:20.594 --> 29:22.513
Aniq, what are you doing?

29:28.810 --> 29:30.562
What the fuck?

29:31.522 --> 29:33.607
-Don't! Stop! Give it--
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.400
Don't! Don't fight!
Don't fight! Don't fight!

29:35.484 --> 29:38.403
-No! No! Don't fight!
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

29:40.864 --> 29:42.533
-It's okay. It's fine.
-No, no, no. Put him d--

29:42.616 --> 29:44.535
-They gotta figure this shit out.
-Oh, my God.

29:44.618 --> 29:46.787
Figure it out, boys. Figure it out, boys.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.038
-Wanna do this?
-Yeah!

29:48.121 --> 29:49.498
-You ready for this?
-I'ma jack you up!

29:49.581 --> 29:50.999
-Oh, my God.
-Don't!

29:51.083 --> 29:53.252
-Kick his ass, dawg.
-Don't! Don't kick his ass!

29:53.335 --> 29:55.796
-Ready for this?
-Yo, make contact, you pussy!

29:55.879 --> 29:58.006
-Yo, if you're gonna fight, fight!
-Make them stop.

29:58.632 --> 29:59.967
No, that's my move!

30:00.050 --> 30:02.469
-You know that's my move! That's my move!
-Coming at ya!

30:02.553 --> 30:05.222
Stop Sound of Music-ing!
Are you dancing or fighting?

30:13.605 --> 30:15.190
Hey, guys, this fight sucks.

30:15.274 --> 30:16.608
-Fucking hit him!
-Don't say that.

30:16.692 --> 30:18.569
This is hurting everyone.

30:20.863 --> 30:22.698
No, hug! Give your bro a hug!

30:24.157 --> 30:26.076
Guys, come on!
We're friends. Everybody's friends.

30:28.370 --> 30:29.454
What's happening?

30:30.372 --> 30:31.623
Cops. Cops.

30:34.960 --> 30:35.961
Aniq, cops!

30:36.044 --> 30:37.796
No, no, no. He's fine! He's fine!

30:44.761 --> 30:47.014
-Whatever this is.
-Up and at 'em. Right now.

30:47.097 --> 30:49.600
-Front and center. Let's go.
-No, no. Look, I didn't do anything.

30:49.683 --> 30:51.476
He-- This guy-- He's wasted!

30:51.560 --> 30:54.188
He just started hitting my car
with a bat for no reason!

30:54.271 --> 30:55.898
-No reason at all?
-No. No.

30:55.981 --> 30:57.858
My name is Eugene Duckworth Jr.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.027
Okay, my dad, he owns Gene's Beans!

31:00.110 --> 31:01.528
-Gene's Beans.
-Are you kidding?

31:01.612 --> 31:02.696
-We love Gene's Beans.
-Yeah?

31:02.779 --> 31:05.157
He used to give us
free coffee every Friday, man.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.284
-Okay.
-My dad works at AT&T.

31:07.367 --> 31:09.703
-That-- Pipe down!
-What? We're not talking to you.

31:09.786 --> 31:11.663
Hey, we're gonna let you go.

31:11.747 --> 31:12.831
-Okay! Okay.
-All right.

31:12.915 --> 31:14.458
-Heck yeah, we are.
-Stay out of trouble.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.877
-To you too. Thank you, Officers.
-Yeah.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.378
-Tell your dad hi.
-Thanks, Officers.

31:18.462 --> 31:19.671
Hey, hey!

31:20.547 --> 31:23.926
Not you, Barry Bonds. Okay?
You're coming with us, am I clear?

31:24.510 --> 31:26.261
Well, Officer, look, please. I'm so sorry.

31:26.345 --> 31:28.472
I-- I don't know what came over me.

31:28.555 --> 31:31.475
I just--
I can't be getting arrested, please.

31:34.061 --> 31:36.396
You wanna press charges? Say the word.

31:37.564 --> 31:40.400
You-- You can't, man.

31:40.484 --> 31:43.320
You can't press charges.
I'll lose my scholarship.

31:44.613 --> 31:46.114
Eugene, please.

31:48.700 --> 31:49.868
It's Xavier, bitch.

31:51.787 --> 31:54.331
-There you go.
-Good choice. You know what that means?

31:54.414 --> 31:58.126
Uh-huh. Yeah. Yep. Take that right foot.

31:58.210 --> 32:00.337
There you go. Let's go. Let's go.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.880
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

32:03.924 --> 32:05.300
What happened? Where did everybody go?

32:05.384 --> 32:07.845
-Come on. Hey.
-Put your clothes back on, son.

32:07.928 --> 32:08.929
Party's over.

32:09.012 --> 32:10.222
You got it. Thank you, Officer.

32:10.305 --> 32:12.224
-Have an incredible night!
-All right.

32:14.142 --> 32:17.855
So there I was, naked as day one,
in front of the po-po.

32:17.938 --> 32:20.107
Empowered and jacked up on the drama,

32:20.190 --> 32:22.901
but somehow, still, "Who's Walt?"

32:22.985 --> 32:25.654
-You know? Ignored, invisible.
-Wait.

32:26.530 --> 32:28.240
You and Xavier never hooked up that night?

32:28.323 --> 32:29.825
-No.
-Come on.

32:29.908 --> 32:32.244
I kept telling you it didn't happen.
Nobody would believe me.

32:32.327 --> 32:34.705
-Mister Cellophane
-Ned, I never would've done that to you.

32:34.788 --> 32:36.915
-Oh, my God.
-Walt.

32:36.999 --> 32:40.502
Can we all just agree that
it's clear that Aniq killed Xavier?

32:40.586 --> 32:44.047
-Oh, my God.
-I mean, you guys, listen. Hear me out.

32:44.131 --> 32:47.426
-He's been holding a grudge for years…
-Stay on me.

32:47.509 --> 32:50.721
…against a man that embarrassed him,
made him lose his scholarship--

32:50.804 --> 32:52.389
Okay, Jenn 1, off of it.

32:52.472 --> 32:55.100
Yeah. You know what's
a great way to deflect being a murderer

32:55.184 --> 32:56.852
is to accuse everybody else of murder.

32:56.935 --> 32:57.853
That's right.

32:57.936 --> 32:59.980
I'm with child.
How could I be the murderer?

33:00.063 --> 33:02.858
That sort of makes sense.
You kill someone and birth a new one in.

33:02.941 --> 33:05.485
-The number stays the same.
-She doesn't do anything these days.

33:05.569 --> 33:09.031
You think I'm just, like, with child,
pushing grown-ass dudes off balconies?

33:09.114 --> 33:11.783
So, you have just been lying
the whole time.

33:11.867 --> 33:14.077
Like, our whole marriage--

33:14.161 --> 33:16.788
or, like, actually,
our whole relationship.

33:16.872 --> 33:20.792
No. I made a mix CD that night
that had the same songs…

33:21.335 --> 33:22.419
-Shaggy.
-Shaggy.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.546
Yeah. I had Shaggy on there,
and it looked the same.

33:24.630 --> 33:26.882
-It was, like, a Magnavox case--
-Just shut up!

33:31.762 --> 33:34.056
And you, why did you never tell me?

33:34.806 --> 33:37.726
-I never knew.
-I didn't know you ever heard it.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.478
I still listen to it.

33:40.395 --> 33:42.022
I made it a playlist.

33:42.105 --> 33:43.273
You did?

33:43.857 --> 33:45.067
Yeah.

33:45.776 --> 33:49.154
I am so sorry to interrupt. Truly, I am.

33:49.238 --> 33:51.448
But this Xavier grudge goes pretty deep.

33:51.532 --> 33:55.077
-So, what do you gotta say for yourself?
-I have--

33:56.161 --> 33:57.746
I have this to say.

33:57.829 --> 33:59.706
Yes! Come on!

33:59.790 --> 34:02.584
-What is that, Band-Aids? What the hell?
-Oh, my God.

34:03.168 --> 34:06.880
Look. All right. This is real evidence
I found myself in the trash.

34:06.964 --> 34:08.465
Yeah, that's nasty.

34:08.549 --> 34:11.635
Whoever wrote this killed Xavier,
all right?

34:11.717 --> 34:14.221
Ripped this up and threw it in the trash.

34:14.304 --> 34:16.931
It's pretty damning.

34:18.350 --> 34:22.271
"I'm coming for ya. You're gonna see
this is payback for what you did to me."

34:22.353 --> 34:24.982
-Yikes.
-"Now's your time to feel the pain.

34:25.065 --> 34:28.150
What goes around comes around again."

34:28.235 --> 34:29.652
Oh, my God, and this rhymes.

34:29.735 --> 34:30.779
Let me see this.

34:31.446 --> 34:34.867
This ain't nothing but lyrics
that Xavier wrote that are garbage,

34:34.949 --> 34:36.284
and he trashed them.

34:36.368 --> 34:37.369
These lyrics suck.

34:37.452 --> 34:41.331
I mean, "pain" rhyming with "again"?

34:41.415 --> 34:42.833
That's what we call a slanted rhyme.

34:42.916 --> 34:46.128
-Where you kinda stretch a word to make--
-Yeah, but this clearly has to be-- Yep.

34:46.920 --> 34:51.049
And… it's a match. Bam.

34:51.800 --> 34:52.926
Shit.

34:53.010 --> 34:54.261
Aniq.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.347
Xavier wrote "diarrhea"
on your neck, right?

34:57.431 --> 34:59.808
That's the reason why
you didn't get the handwriting sample.

34:59.892 --> 35:01.602
Because he died. He perished.

35:01.685 --> 35:03.520
Yeah, I know. Thanks. Thanks, buddy.

35:03.604 --> 35:05.522
You know, I wanna be on your side.

35:05.606 --> 35:09.151
But you make that very hard for me.
And I know you've been hiding a lot.

35:09.234 --> 35:12.446
Everybody seems to be hiding something.
Isn't that right, Detective?

35:12.529 --> 35:14.281
You trying me right now?

35:14.364 --> 35:19.745
No. Look, this guy's story shows that
everybody here hated Xavier.

35:20.913 --> 35:24.917
Look, my point-- Okay, my point is,
anybody could've gone upstairs before me.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.835
Like, say,

35:27.836 --> 35:28.837
me.

35:29.755 --> 35:31.048
Zoë, what are you doing?

35:31.131 --> 35:34.176
No. Not like you. That's not what I meant.

35:34.259 --> 35:35.844
How do you know I didn't do it?

35:36.345 --> 35:38.096
I mean, you haven't heard my story yet.

35:38.180 --> 35:40.682
But we know you don't have
a grudge against Xavier.

35:41.975 --> 35:43.268
Well,

35:43.352 --> 35:45.312
I didn't at the beginning of the night.
