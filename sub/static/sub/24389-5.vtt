00:11.803 --> 00:13.243
<i>I believe the car chose me.</i>

00:13.472 --> 00:15.185
<i>We've been through so much together</i>

00:15.247 --> 00:17.976
it's almost like,
I think that's my wife, you know?

00:19.438 --> 00:20.438
Uh-oh.

00:20.483 --> 00:21.789
<i>Because I'm a street racer,</i>

00:21.813 --> 00:23.117
<i>when somebody talks shit to me,</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:25.400
<i>there's my car.
What do you want to do?</i>

00:25.484 --> 00:28.737
<i>When they're laughing at you,
you brought a knife to a gunfight?</i>

00:28.946 --> 00:30.572
<i>No, we brought the warship.</i>

00:32.866 --> 00:34.493
<i>This is my drug, you know?</i>

00:34.974 --> 00:36.634
<i>This is what gets me high,</i>

00:36.764 --> 00:38.830
<i>making this car better
and better and better.</i>

00:38.914 --> 00:40.006
Thank you.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.004
<i>We've raced Ferraris in the past,
and it's not been a problem,</i>

00:46.113 --> 00:48.282
and the Ferrari guy can't understand
how he lost.

00:48.674 --> 00:50.884
<i>And yet he doesn't realize
he never had a chance.</i>

00:51.468 --> 00:53.679
- Start it up.
- What a dickhead.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.983
<i>It's gonna boil down to the driver.</i>

00:56.640 --> 00:58.433
It boils down to the tenths of a second.

00:58.850 --> 01:02.396
<i>I wouldn't even be in this race
if I didn't think I had a chance.</i>

01:02.646 --> 01:04.397
<i>That's just me. I'm a confident fucker.</i>

01:22.082 --> 01:24.223
When I set out to build this car,

01:24.323 --> 01:27.212
I set out to build it the best
in every possible category.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.048
The best paint, best interior, best motor.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.725
I never wanted to lose at anything,
so, I... I put in

01:33.885 --> 01:36.388
<i>150,000 in this car.</i>

01:36.513 --> 01:41.184
<i>And I made it the most powerful
LT1 motor in the country.</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:45.753
Back in 2004, my brother and I bought
Red's Hydraulics.

01:45.928 --> 01:47.274
<i>We were car guys.</i>

01:47.357 --> 01:50.110
<i>Yes, we knew about cars,
but not so much about the low ride,</i>

01:50.569 --> 01:51.741
<i>and it's a different culture.</i>

01:51.987 --> 01:55.198
<i>Low riders are a type of car, the ones
that are nearly touching the ground.</i>

01:55.407 --> 01:58.980
<i>But it's the hydraulics that boost them up
and down, like a little dance.</i>

01:59.536 --> 02:01.288
This car was called the Black Widow.

02:02.359 --> 02:05.959
<i>This car was a world champion
for over 12 years.</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:08.726
<i>It would fly all four wheels
off the ground</i>

02:08.854 --> 02:10.172
as high as my forehead.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.424
<i>It would hit back bumper within two hits.</i>

02:12.549 --> 02:15.218
<i>It would do side to side.
It would dance around.</i>

02:15.344 --> 02:17.763
<i>The switches controlled
the hydraulic pump,</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:20.891
<i>so, we actually drove the car outside
on a switch panel.</i>

02:21.308 --> 02:23.780
<i>It's what made our company famous.</i>

02:27.145 --> 02:29.345
<i>We had this on the circuit
for over 20 years.</i>

02:29.816 --> 02:32.402
And I retired it,
and I parked it back here.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.715
And now this is what a $40,000
paint job looks like

02:35.781 --> 02:37.491
after ten years.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.663
<i>The car was a representation of us,
all our life.</i>

02:43.080 --> 02:44.409
<i>My dad was a mechanic.</i>

02:44.584 --> 02:47.073
<i>My dad loved cars. We loved cars.</i>

02:47.668 --> 02:50.837
<i>Seven years ago,
my brother and I were collecting cars,</i>

02:50.962 --> 02:53.924
and we had a dream of taking these cars,
and rebuilding them,

02:54.007 --> 02:56.009
and bringing them back
and showing them off.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.690
<i>But when my brother passed away
six years ago,</i>

02:58.765 --> 02:59.888
<i>I parked everything.</i>

02:59.971 --> 03:01.765
<i>I pulled everything to the back yard.</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:04.142
Toward the end, my brother said,
"You know what?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.936
Let's buy an Impala. Let's fix it up."

03:06.520 --> 03:10.148
Well, he started fixing it
and he never really drove the car.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.901
I remember he put the stereo system in it,

03:13.151 --> 03:15.737
and we were picking up
from the stereo shop.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.989
He throws me the keys and he says,
"Hey, you know what?

03:18.073 --> 03:19.891
Jump in, let's go for a ride."

03:20.016 --> 03:21.993
So, throughout the whole trip home,

03:22.077 --> 03:25.080
my brother's asking me,
"How does the car feel? Is the car fast?"

03:25.414 --> 03:29.292
And I remember, many times,
it was parked in his garage.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.896
And I asked him, "You know what?
Why aren't you driving the car?"

03:31.920 --> 03:33.600
You know,
"Why aren't you driving the car?"

03:33.672 --> 03:36.783
And he says, "You know what?
I'm waiting for you to finish your Impala.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.350
When you finish your Impala,
we'll drive it together."

03:40.387 --> 03:41.814
I never finished my Impala...

03:42.431 --> 03:44.516
and my brother never drove that car.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.979
And, you know, when he passed away,
I thought about it, thought about it,

03:49.438 --> 03:51.022
how, you know, here I am,

03:51.523 --> 03:54.359
wants the best of the best
and try to build the nicest car.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.989
But you know what?
There comes a time when...

03:58.238 --> 03:59.358
you've just got to enjoy it.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.910
<i>Last five years,
I took my brother's Impala,</i>

04:03.994 --> 04:06.508
<i>and I tried to make it
the nicest Impala in the country.</i>

04:06.913 --> 04:08.680
<i>I touched every nut and bolt in that car</i>

04:08.850 --> 04:10.751
<i>in my brother's honor and name.</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:13.361
<i>I built it to be fast.</i>

04:16.130 --> 04:17.531
<i>You know, you can't really give up.</i>

04:17.591 --> 04:19.591
<i>And I know my brother
didn't want me to give up.</i>

04:19.885 --> 04:22.137
<i>And I'm just doing it slow now.</i>

04:22.262 --> 04:25.182
And I feel my brother with me
and I'm gonna do it in his honor.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.531
<i>Twice a week we come here, you know,
pay our respects to Tony and Dad.</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:36.067
<i>And this is where we come see him...</i>

04:36.985 --> 04:38.047
<i>every week.</i>

04:39.863 --> 04:41.583
I'm gonna go over there
and give him a kiss.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.462
This Tuesday, I'm gonna race a Ferrari.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.821
I know I'm stupid, but...

04:58.882 --> 04:59.989
You know what?

05:00.289 --> 05:02.636
It's a short life
and, you know, I love you.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.890
I'm having fun. I love you.
I can't wait to see you guys.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.319
<i>You know what? When I first built it,</i>

05:13.063 --> 05:15.065
<i>I brought the car here for my brother.</i>

05:15.732 --> 05:17.734
<i>And I sat on that bench and cried,</i>

05:18.443 --> 05:20.987
and tried to make sense to me, saying,
"You know what?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.199
You only live once, man.
You only live once." And...

05:25.492 --> 05:29.037
I'm doing this, I'm doing this
out of pride and honor, you know?

05:29.663 --> 05:32.499
<i>I have to win
for my dad and brother Tony.</i>

05:33.875 --> 05:34.918
<i>It means a lot.</i>

05:45.595 --> 05:48.056
So, is this like an interrogation?
Do I need my lawyer?

05:52.143 --> 05:54.312
<i>The story of Fabian began in Burbank.</i>

05:54.563 --> 05:56.624
<i>When I was little, we had a neighbor
that worked on cars,</i>

05:56.648 --> 05:58.733
<i>and I was always with him,
helping him out, and...</i>

05:58.984 --> 06:00.986
<i>He was really cool,
and I enjoyed doing it.</i>

06:01.278 --> 06:03.798
And then when we went to Burbank,
we went to Van Nuys Boulevard.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.627
<i>And Van Nuys Boulevard was just happening.</i>

06:05.756 --> 06:07.576
<i>It was like nothing you ever saw.</i>

06:07.742 --> 06:09.001
<i>The cars were amazing.</i>

06:09.536 --> 06:11.296
<i>The people were amazing.
We had a lot of fun,</i>

06:11.371 --> 06:13.957
and we were 12, 13, 14 years old
going down there.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.376
<i>The first car I got was a V8 Vega.</i>

06:16.710 --> 06:20.088
I crashed it not too soon after I got it,
because it was just a handful.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.062
<i>Learned about cars the hard way,
by putting that car back together,</i>

06:23.550 --> 06:26.928
and then started going out
and racing that car and getting hustled.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.431
We got hustled by some guys in Downey,

06:29.514 --> 06:31.683
we got hustled by some guys
in Linwood area.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.144
And these guys told us about a place

06:34.227 --> 06:36.605
that people would race
on the street, legally.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.524
And we said, "Bullshit,
there's no place like that."

06:39.608 --> 06:41.408
So, we went to go check it out.
And there was.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.462
<i>It was called Terminal Island.
And it was a street.</i>

06:43.486 --> 06:46.486
<i>And everybody was there, and Big Willie
was there, the first time I met him.</i>

06:47.991 --> 06:49.951
Now, I got to make this clearâ€¦

06:50.051 --> 06:52.621
Our main goal at that racetrack...

06:52.871 --> 06:56.291
Our main product that we want to produce
is brotherhood.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.668
Everybody understand that?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.130
Let me hear it.
Now, what are we trying to produce?

07:02.339 --> 07:04.007
- Brotherhood!
- All right.

07:04.072 --> 07:05.547
<i>Willie's thing was</i>

07:05.677 --> 07:08.178
<i>don't fight each other
with guns, knives or fists.</i>

07:08.261 --> 07:09.679
<i>Take each other on with your cars.</i>

07:10.180 --> 07:12.278
<i>And it could be your cars, foot race,</i>

07:12.378 --> 07:13.950
<i>motorcycles, whatever.</i>

07:14.184 --> 07:18.021
And then you come back and do it again.
So, a lot of guys would stop gang banging.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.857
They'd stop, you know...
It was an amazing place.

07:21.107 --> 07:25.595
Crime in Los Angeles went down
60 percent.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.491
All of a sudden, there was
no drive-by shootings anymore.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.627
<i>Now Terminal Island's gone.</i>

07:32.797 --> 07:34.904
<i>We're fighting
for a safer place to street race.</i>

07:35.080 --> 07:36.515
- What's up, man?
- Don't be calling no...

07:36.539 --> 07:39.252
<i>We've only got
a few members here, but this is family.</i>

07:39.402 --> 07:41.773
<i>This is where family is and family begins,</i>

07:42.043 --> 07:43.338
and we all act like family.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.715
We have our problems, we have our disputes

07:45.799 --> 07:47.884
<i>and at the same time
we all love each other.</i>

07:48.343 --> 07:52.847
You know, we're all about brotherhood
which means friendship.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.725
We don't care what nationality you are,

07:55.809 --> 07:58.019
whether you're white, black,
green, purple, red.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.438
Cars bring us all together.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.191
<i>Everybody took on something to do</i>

08:03.316 --> 08:06.444
<i>and made it their project
in helping Willie do what he had to do.</i>

08:07.028 --> 08:10.115
And then he got sick,
and he didn't wanna be around anymore.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.718
And we couldn't change that.

08:11.818 --> 08:14.369
And the sad part was,
he ended up passing away.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.373
It's just hard.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.295
I do miss Willie a lot.

08:26.047 --> 08:30.635
Because to replace Willie, it took
about ten of us and he was one guy.

08:36.808 --> 08:40.437
<i>I've got a 1984 Cutlass.</i>

08:40.812 --> 08:43.565
<i>The model is POS
which stands for Piece of Shit.</i>

08:44.149 --> 08:46.693
<i>This car here, we found it literally
at a wrecking yard.</i>

08:46.943 --> 08:49.353
<i>We got this for 400 dollars
and saved a bunch of money.</i>

08:49.571 --> 08:52.574
<i>So, when we went to go look at this car,
we had to get the sheriffs</i>

08:52.657 --> 08:55.285
<i>to evict the family of cats
that were living in there.</i>

08:55.368 --> 08:58.121
And surprisingly, they were living
next door to some rats,

08:58.246 --> 09:00.184
so, I don't know how that worked.

09:00.254 --> 09:02.292
So, we had to get rid of those guys, too.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.462
So, we cleaned this thing out
as best as we could, and...

09:05.712 --> 09:08.173
<i>There's just a lot of stuff in there
that was rusted.</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:10.425
<i>It had been sitting out, not protected.</i>

09:10.717 --> 09:13.261
So, we had a lot of things,
hoses, brake lines, tires.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.973
<i>I mean, just a lot of stuff that gets
ruined with age, just from sitting.</i>

09:17.057 --> 09:19.559
We got zip ties for this car.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.322
A lot of stuffs just held on
just to make it look like it's held on.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.190
Some of the stuff has flown off
when we ran the car before,

09:25.398 --> 09:28.032
because these are old plastics,
and they're brittle, they're falling off,

09:28.056 --> 09:29.416
so, the chrome's coming off of it.

09:29.778 --> 09:33.323
And then we've got our little setup
to hold the trunk open, because...

09:33.782 --> 09:36.743
like I said, it's an old car.
Nothing in it works.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.805
<i>And then we took this thing
because nobody would be afraid of it,</i>

09:39.829 --> 09:44.459
and we've upgraded it to a car now
that'll do 135 miles an hour at least.

09:44.751 --> 09:45.752
And...

09:46.544 --> 09:49.672
basically, hurt a lot of people's feelings
because it's such an ugly, old car.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.549
They wouldn't expect it to be that fast.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.678
<i>Sleepers are more or less cars
that you just don't expect,</i>

09:55.762 --> 09:58.348
<i>a car that you look at,
saying, "That can't be that fast."</i>

09:59.057 --> 10:01.684
I mean, when a guy spends
half a million dollars

10:01.810 --> 10:05.021
or a quarter million dollars on a car,
he knows what he's getting.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.773
But when he puts it up against a car

10:06.856 --> 10:08.608
that looks like
it's only worth 500 dollars,

10:08.942 --> 10:11.027
they don't know what to expect from it.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.905
But people like it,
because it's just such a surprise.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.032
You're just going,
"Where did that come from?"

10:16.324 --> 10:17.408
And the car, you know...

10:17.492 --> 10:20.578
All of a sudden,
you've got a wolf in sheep's clothing.

10:20.829 --> 10:24.738
And it comes out of nowhere.
You woke up the beast.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.420
<i>I consider myself a car guy
to the extreme.</i>

10:30.839 --> 10:32.465
As you can see by my living quarters...

10:33.466 --> 10:35.510
<i>yeah, it's what I'm about.</i>

10:42.892 --> 10:45.103
<i>So, when you get bit by the car bug,</i>

10:45.186 --> 10:46.402
<i>it's just something that...</i>

10:46.852 --> 10:47.910
<i>you can't get rid of.</i>

10:48.773 --> 10:51.818
I can't explain it, but it's just
by owning the car itself,

10:51.901 --> 10:55.321
you have this feeling of pleasure,
you know? This is what you love.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.012
And you come out here and look at it,
and it just makes you...

10:58.158 --> 11:00.191
I don't know.
It just gives me pleasure.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.912
Almost like a car hoarder
if you want to call it that.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.874
I also just keep everything
that I take off a car, you know?

11:06.040 --> 11:08.501
I store it here.
This is my organized mess.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.754
<i>I know where everything is at.
I know what I have.</i>

11:12.130 --> 11:15.675
I have everything here from 1930s
to 1950s,

11:16.342 --> 11:19.095
from Japanese parts, to go-kart parts.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.183
I mean, you name it.
It's so much stuff. Turbo piping.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.560
Jeez, I mean, I can tell you
where all this stuff is.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.897
I don't want to throw anything away.
You never know when you're gonna need it.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.947
<i>Now, the way I got into drifting was
I met other people at car shows</i>

11:38.031 --> 11:40.878
<i>that introduced me to Japanese videos
on drifting.</i>

11:40.992 --> 11:43.786
<i>And I thought it was fascinating,
so, I gave it a shot.</i>

11:43.912 --> 11:45.622
<i>I was the only Mexican around.</i>

11:45.705 --> 11:48.708
The rest of the guys were either,
you know, Asian or Japanese,

11:48.791 --> 11:50.811
because that's where it came from,
the Japanese sport.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.837
And I'm a very competitive type of guy,

11:52.921 --> 11:56.174
so I said, "Hey, if these guys can do it,
I'm gonna do it."

11:58.426 --> 11:59.996
<i>To me, drifting is a balance.</i>

12:00.511 --> 12:02.764
<i>It takes skill,
it takes the amount of gas,</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:06.601
<i>amount of pedal you want to put into it,
braking, steering angle.</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:10.521
<i>All that has to be perfect for your car
to slide the way you want it to slide.</i>

12:13.524 --> 12:15.985
<i>So, I've had the car bug all my life.</i>

12:18.446 --> 12:20.865
So, it's a heart with a turbo in it.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.881
My turbo's powering the heart.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.340
This is my 1983 Toyota Supra.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.135
It's been with me since 1989.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.431
I know, I was like an eighth-grader,
something like that.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.267
But it's just a cool ride.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.772
And this is the baby
that's gonna race on Tuesday.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.897
<i>Well, my car's a sleeper car</i>

12:52.981 --> 12:55.984
<i>because it wasn't meant to be
as fast as it is now.</i>

12:56.109 --> 13:00.780
<i>The upgrades to it are just insane
and the power-to-weight ratio makes it</i>

13:00.947 --> 13:03.032
<i>like a super, super, super fast car.</i>

13:03.533 --> 13:05.368
<i>But people don't think
it's going to be fast</i>

13:05.451 --> 13:08.997
<i>until they actually hear it and see it,
and then they're very surprised.</i>

13:09.455 --> 13:12.709
<i>So, this is just Japanese style
but with taste, you know?</i>

13:13.001 --> 13:16.254
<i>You know, it's rewarding to me
because I built it, I drive it.</i>

13:16.462 --> 13:18.381
<i>As a builder, you want to see results.</i>

13:19.716 --> 13:23.261
<i>And it's funny, because we've been
through so much together, the car and I.</i>

13:23.344 --> 13:26.493
It's almost like...
I think that's my wife, you know?

13:28.391 --> 13:29.809
Hey, Manny, where are you?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.425
Hey, guess what we're racing?

13:31.550 --> 13:33.187
- What?
- Check this out.

13:34.856 --> 13:39.402
A Ferrari 488GTB, 2017.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.446
That's gonna be funny.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.948
We're gonna make this guy's life miserable
when he loses.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.040
I can't wait to see the look on his face
when he sees what he's racing.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.746
- Yeah.
- Wait 'till he gets a load of us.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.750
<i>I want to know how fast this Ferrari is.</i>

13:54.292 --> 13:56.263
488, mid-engine,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.880
3.9 liter... Oh, twin turbo as well.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.840
It's pretty fast. It runs 10s.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.186
- It looks nice, huh? Holy shit.
- Seven speed, dual clutch.

14:04.241 --> 14:06.739
I'm gonna scare the shit out
of him with my exhaust, though.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.391
I'm gonna pull up beating,
loud as hell with the stereo,

14:10.725 --> 14:13.144
and then I'm gonna drown him out
with my exhaust.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.688
Who is this guy? Let's just say

14:15.813 --> 14:18.316
he's this billionaire
who owns this Ferrari, who probably...

14:18.441 --> 14:20.943
He probably bought it yesterday, you know?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.839
And he said, "Hey, you know,
I'm down to race, whatever you want."

14:23.863 --> 14:25.463
Let's just hope that that's what he did.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.492
- Right, right.
- Right, man.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.887
- Let's hope he doesn't have his...
- Straight up fight.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.956
Straight up stick shift,
clutch, gears, you got him.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.291
Yeah, for sure.

14:49.472 --> 14:53.017
<i>This was the car that I
never thought I would have,</i>

14:53.393 --> 14:55.241
so, it's very special to me

14:55.311 --> 14:57.271
and I treat it very well,

14:57.355 --> 14:59.315
and it puts me in a great mood.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.860
Every time I hear it start up,
I love the sound.

15:02.944 --> 15:06.155
You just keep reminding yourself
you're in a Ferrari

15:06.280 --> 15:08.520
<i>when you look at the little horsey
on the steering wheel.</i>

15:08.574 --> 15:10.655
<i>It's just, like, wow, this is my car.</i>

15:10.972 --> 15:12.453
<i>It's... pretty cool.</i>

15:13.788 --> 15:16.666
The idea of actually having
that car was...

15:17.375 --> 15:19.377
amazing to me, so I'd put on my...

15:19.919 --> 15:22.672
Bocelli music, and I'd go run
through the canyons with it,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.964
<i>and just imagine myself racing.</i>

15:26.134 --> 15:28.175
I'm driving the 488 Ferrari,

15:28.828 --> 15:30.430
<i>twin turbo V8.</i>

15:30.555 --> 15:34.183
I think they did a really good job
on creating a supercar

15:34.267 --> 15:37.854
<i>that you can drive on the streets,
and yet take it out on the track</i>

15:37.979 --> 15:41.274
<i>and get the full benefits
of really what the car's meant to do.</i>

15:42.442 --> 15:45.153
<i>Yeah, when people see this car,
it definitely draws attention.</i>

15:45.236 --> 15:47.141
<i>When I see it, it attracts the eye.</i>

15:47.306 --> 15:48.489
<i>The lines are beautiful.</i>

15:48.614 --> 15:50.883
<i>Everyone loves seeing a Ferrari drive by,</i>

15:51.873 --> 15:53.165
<i>no matter who you are.</i>

15:54.787 --> 15:55.913
Grew up in the desert,

15:55.997 --> 16:00.668
and my dad was always into desert sports,
motor sports.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.423
<i>And he'd always work on the cars
on the weekends,</i>

16:03.588 --> 16:06.883
<i>and our bonding time, I think,
for me growing up was</i>

16:07.175 --> 16:09.802
being with him under the car,
handing him wrenches,

16:10.011 --> 16:11.778
and having the radio on and...

16:12.069 --> 16:13.598
fixing things.

16:14.015 --> 16:17.468
Any way we could find a way around
and do car stuff,

16:17.788 --> 16:19.072
go on rides,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.047
speed down freeways at night,

16:21.197 --> 16:22.565
we would do that together.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.486
We'd say, okay, you can't drive
unless you're doing at least 85.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.779
All those moments kind of together,

16:29.113 --> 16:34.368
<i>just gave me that thrill of speed
and cars and building engines.</i>

16:34.619 --> 16:36.871
It really all kind of stemmed from...
from him.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.501
<i>I remember when Lisa and I were dating</i>

16:42.710 --> 16:45.213
and she would beat me
in just about everything we'd try to do.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.307
So, it was like hanging out with a buddy.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.423
I had a motorcycle

16:48.550 --> 16:52.220
and I said, "Hey, let's hop on the back
of my motorcycle

16:52.303 --> 16:54.847
and we'll go down the street
and get an ice cream or something."

16:55.181 --> 16:58.181
And I was pretty reluctant, but I thought,
"Okay, well, I've got to do this,

16:58.226 --> 17:00.144
because I do like this guy." And...

17:00.811 --> 17:04.147
So, I got on the back
and we barely got a few blocks, and...

17:05.398 --> 17:08.736
I was really grabbing on to him
because it was freaking me out.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.321
- Like, "Wait, does he see that car?"
- We came back.

17:11.821 --> 17:14.242
I got, she got off the motorcycle,
I got off the motorcycle.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.410
Took off her helmet or I took mine off
and I said,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.042
"So, I was pretty good, right?

17:18.101 --> 17:19.565
Do you feel good
about riding on the back?"

17:19.589 --> 17:21.309
She goes, "No, it still scares me
to death."

17:21.374 --> 17:23.125
I said, "Well, can I jump on?"

17:23.459 --> 17:24.728
And he goes, "What do you mean?"

17:24.752 --> 17:26.973
I go, "Well, can I take your bike
for a spin?"

17:27.046 --> 17:28.881
And he was really caught off guard
by that.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.984
I said, "I thought you were afraid
to ride on a motorcycle."

17:31.008 --> 17:33.408
She goes, "No, I'm afraid to ride
on the back of a motorcycle

17:33.469 --> 17:35.012
when I'm not driving."

17:35.096 --> 17:38.224
And she took that thing
and popped a wheelie and took off.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.894
He was just like, "Oh, my God,
you didn't tell me you rode bikes."

17:42.478 --> 17:45.147
She's always been pedal to the metal.

17:45.273 --> 17:48.442
Leadfoots, mechanics,
understanding, coordinated,

17:48.526 --> 17:50.778
and then she says she wants to race.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.121
Made sense.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.756
So, I joined the Ferrari club

17:55.906 --> 17:58.202
and... actually learned how to race.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.942
<i>These cars have been thought out,</i>

18:15.042 --> 18:17.972
<i>blueprinted out beyond genius level.</i>

18:18.306 --> 18:22.768
So, to see a sleeper off the gun
next to this car on a drag race,

18:22.977 --> 18:25.813
quarter-mile straightaway,
that's gonna be really interesting to see

18:25.896 --> 18:28.858
what you can put together
to go up against one of these.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.407
Ready?

18:37.992 --> 18:42.496
This is probably the most intricate build
I've done in quite a long time.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.206
It's almost no expense spared.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.127
<i>There's just so many upgrades I did
to the car that I think are super cool,</i>

18:48.210 --> 18:51.778
<i>and I'm super impressed with my level
of work I've done to this car.</i>

18:52.506 --> 18:54.096
<i>The car's been running fine</i>

18:54.166 --> 18:56.052
<i>up until I had to make
the necessary changes</i>

18:56.135 --> 18:58.348
<i>to create a massive amount of horsepower</i>

18:58.464 --> 19:00.348
<i>to keep up or beat a supercar.</i>

19:00.431 --> 19:02.725
<i>And it's just giving me nothing
but problems.</i>

19:03.351 --> 19:06.312
<i>Right now, we don't have any power
to the ECU</i>

19:06.395 --> 19:08.314
<i>which is the computer in the engine.</i>

19:08.773 --> 19:10.852
<i>And it's not communicating with my laptop.</i>

19:11.427 --> 19:15.404
<i>It won't tell my engine
what it needs to do to start.</i>

19:17.615 --> 19:19.575
<i>I think I have the right people
under my wing</i>

19:19.659 --> 19:20.910
<i>that are gonna make it happen.</i>

19:21.494 --> 19:25.498
So, in a sense, I'm really not
too stressed out about that.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.869
The thing I really am
stressed out about is...

19:29.064 --> 19:30.670
whether or not I'm gonna break

19:30.753 --> 19:32.672
or what's this thing gonna do
when it turns on

19:32.755 --> 19:34.965
and how it's gonna react,
and all that stuff.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.926
<i>If it doesn't get turned on,
we don't get to race.</i>

19:38.052 --> 19:39.679
<i>And it's not that far away.</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:43.224
- Hey, Peanut.
- Yeah?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.559
It's not a car show, it's a car race.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.771
And I'm not gonna go there
looking like a hoopty.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.982
I'm still gonna go there
looking like I'm proud of my car

19:52.191 --> 19:53.459
and what I've done to my car.

19:53.559 --> 19:54.628
You know, we're at a point,

19:54.652 --> 19:56.987
we've been at the damn engine shop
for the last month,

19:57.154 --> 19:59.341
trying to make as much horsepower
as we can out of this car.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.742
We're at that max.
So, we've got to lose some weight.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.056
Peanut, you've taken off the wheels.
Let's weigh these fuckers.

20:05.659 --> 20:07.219
Well, let me get it off first.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.721
Let's see how much this race wheel weighs.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.953
- Let's see how much you weight.
- Me?

20:13.963 --> 20:16.386
- I think I might...
- Holy shit, 245. It's accurate.

20:16.410 --> 20:18.151
I think
I might have to drive your car.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.176
Let's see.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.512
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, shit.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.515
If Peanut drives, it's one car length
faster. He's 100 pounds less.

20:25.850 --> 20:26.892
Okay.

20:27.685 --> 20:32.231
This wheel weighs under 50 pounds,
so, like, 45 pounds.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.609
Let's see what my factory wheels weight.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.446
Seventy... 75 pounds.

20:39.113 --> 20:42.074
It's almost, pretty much
just changing out these two wheels

20:42.324 --> 20:45.286
gives it almost a three-quarter,
almost a car length faster,

20:45.369 --> 20:46.829
just by these two wheels.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.039
<i>I could take out the back seats,
every battery,</i>

20:49.123 --> 20:53.400
<i>all the subwoofers, all the amps.
Shit, I can probably pull out 1000 pounds.</i>

20:56.172 --> 20:57.840
All right, so after you finish this,

20:57.923 --> 20:59.651
we've got to lose a little bit
more weight, right?

20:59.675 --> 21:01.367
But not me. I'm not gonna lose
no fucking weight.

21:01.391 --> 21:02.632
- I guess.
- The batteries.

21:02.656 --> 21:05.345
- Depends on how serious it is back there.
- You need to keep one of them in there.

21:05.369 --> 21:08.209
<i>Because I need to still start the car
and have a little bit of a stereo.</i>

21:08.350 --> 21:11.390
Well, if I can slide these
out of here without electrocuting myself.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.690
- So, we're gonna take out three, right?
- Yeah, three.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.568
Save the easiest one for the main.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.864
Holy cow.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.700
- It ain't heavy.
- Jesus!

21:25.075 --> 21:26.155
Ready to weigh this sucker?

21:27.047 --> 21:29.205
Oh, good. Fifty pounds.

21:29.914 --> 21:33.050
So, four batteries, 200 pounds.
That's another two car lengths.

21:34.126 --> 21:38.798
<i>I'm confident that my 1996 Impala
will beat any super car out there.</i>

21:40.424 --> 21:43.385
<i>I changed everything on the car
except for the transmission.</i>

21:43.844 --> 21:45.846
So tomorrow,
I'm gonna pull out the transmission.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.057
- You're working?
- Yeah. I've got two days.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.966
Two days, I'll replace the whole damn car
if I had to.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.355
I know Tony and Papa are proud of you.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.250
- Thank you.
- He's watching over you.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.902
And he'll be sitting in that car
right next to you in that race.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.028
- Yeah. I don't want to fail him.
- You're not.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.163
I had a great uncle
and his name was Don Branson

22:11.247 --> 22:13.471
<i>and he's a hall of fame sprint car,</i>

22:13.621 --> 22:15.042
<i>midget car guy.</i>

22:15.251 --> 22:17.086
<i>He also did some Formula 1.</i>

22:17.294 --> 22:22.091
And he was racing with Mario Andretti's
partner, Dick Atkins.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.885
<i>And they crashed,
and both of them were killed.</i>

22:25.594 --> 22:27.668
<i>I actually spoke to Mario about that,</i>

22:28.097 --> 22:29.849
<i>and, yeah, he was just like,</i>

22:29.969 --> 22:31.934
<i>"Lisa, I was there. I was racing that day.</i>

22:32.017 --> 22:35.495
<i>It was one of the saddest days
in racing," you know?</i>

22:35.570 --> 22:39.693
<i>Really dangerous back then.
In those days, not a lot of safety in cars</i>

22:39.842 --> 22:42.337
and not a lot of safe gear,

22:42.442 --> 22:44.117
and those cars were...

22:44.488 --> 22:47.283
I mean, those guys were going
150 for sure.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.784
So, it was pretty sad.

22:54.707 --> 22:58.460
Some of these up here are from Ferrari,
and another series I was in,

22:58.544 --> 23:00.796
EXR series last season.

23:01.297 --> 23:05.426
And I was amateur champion for the series,
so that was cool.

23:05.609 --> 23:08.445
<i>So, I earned the most points for that
in all the races.</i>

23:08.637 --> 23:11.849
And these were the different tracks
that I received.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.143
One was Spring Mountain. That's in Nevada.

23:15.769 --> 23:16.812
Sonoma.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.617
Fontana and Laguna Seca.

23:21.073 --> 23:24.320
I mean, having these around keeps me
in that mindset of knowing

23:24.486 --> 23:26.753
<i>all that hard work
that I love to do</i>

23:26.872 --> 23:28.699
<i>really paid off for me,</i>

23:28.782 --> 23:30.036
and it's just a good reminder.

23:30.156 --> 23:32.161
And I like my daughters seeing it too.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.205
I think it's good inspiration
for them to see that,

23:35.748 --> 23:39.168
"Yeah, Mom, she's always at the track
but look, it's worth it."

23:39.710 --> 23:41.099
<i>I will give it my all.</i>

23:41.299 --> 23:43.839
<i>I'm really excited
and I absolutely wanna win.</i>

23:45.466 --> 23:47.376
<i>I talk a big game,
but the reality is,</i>

23:47.521 --> 23:49.261
<i>the Cutlass is not running.</i>

23:49.345 --> 23:53.098
<i>And it's really, really getting to me.
It's starting to piss me off.</i>

23:53.641 --> 23:56.986
None of this stuff was designed
or made to fit for this car.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.146
and we're not engineers
and we're making it fit.

23:59.521 --> 24:00.522
That's our problem.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.192
I mean, it's not a little, it don't close.
It don't close at all.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.403
<i>This is a Frankenstein.
It's gonna look like Frankenstein.</i>

24:06.652 --> 24:08.989
All we need to do is put the bolts
on the side of the car

24:09.114 --> 24:10.157
to match a Frankenstein.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.701
Hey, Johnny's here. Close the hood.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.200
<i>Johnny is
a Brotherhood member</i>

24:17.295 --> 24:19.833
<i>who's been a brother member
for a long time,</i>

24:20.084 --> 24:21.387
<i>and he loves to race.</i>

24:21.877 --> 24:23.273
<i>When he heard we were building
the Cutlass,</i>

24:23.297 --> 24:26.149
<i>he started talking shit about the Cutlass
and talking shit about his car.</i>

24:26.173 --> 24:27.675
<i>So, we told him, bring it.</i>

24:31.053 --> 24:32.346
I forgot your toilet paper.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.178
Because I know you're probably
shitting on yourself.

24:35.253 --> 24:36.850
Goddamn.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.620
- All right, you gonna be there Tuesday?
- Where at?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.572
We've got to race some Ferrari somewhere.
I don't know.

24:40.596 --> 24:42.019
- Where at?
- I have no idea.

24:42.043 --> 24:43.403
But we're gonna go race a Ferrari.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.044
But you're gonna be on my side that night.
You're gonna be talking for me.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.861
His tires cost more than the car.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.072
- I believe that.
- It's true.

24:50.406 --> 24:52.086
I think my Jordans cost more
than your car.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.703
Because besides the Ferrari
kicking your ass,

24:55.828 --> 24:58.622
I'm gonna kick you in the ass
if you lose. So, you better not lose.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.458
I'm not losing to a Ferrari.
I'd rather lose to you than a Ferrari.

25:01.709 --> 25:04.086
I bet you anything
I can start this car in two seconds.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.374
I bet you could.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.980
Fabian's trying to get that car ready
by Tuesday to race this Ferrari.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.899
I really doubt it, but at the same time,
I've seen Fabian do miracles.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.319
Fuel pump ain't cutting on.
You can't even hear it.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.667
<i>I feel extremely defeated and frustrated.</i>

25:34.783 --> 25:37.383
<i>But I'm not gonna let it get the best
of me. But it's starting to.</i>

25:37.453 --> 25:38.746
<i>So, it's pissing me off.</i>

25:40.330 --> 25:42.879
<i>We've not happy. But we've got
to get this thing fixed.</i>

25:44.293 --> 25:46.712
<i>We like being heroes.
Don't like being zeroes.</i>

25:48.937 --> 25:50.796
Twenty-five bucks
can't be wrong, though.

25:50.820 --> 25:52.009
Can't go wrong with 25...

25:52.092 --> 25:54.053
<i>Fernando is a really good tech.</i>

25:54.136 --> 25:56.930
<i>He knows a lot about how to wire
and how to diagnose.</i>

25:57.473 --> 26:00.476
<i>So, he's gonna check the ECU
and see what's going on</i>

26:01.101 --> 26:03.353
<i>and hopefully we can get
this thing fired up.</i>

26:03.937 --> 26:06.257
And we're gonna connect this cool scope

26:06.777 --> 26:08.776
that Fernie was nice enough to bring.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.569
Probably cost about a million bucks.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.351
- How much does it cost exactly, Fernie?
- Like ten grand.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.782
Ten grand!

26:15.324 --> 26:17.242
All right, so let's start there.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.804
It's nice and silver.

26:21.622 --> 26:22.655
Slide it over,

26:23.355 --> 26:24.500
some heat shrink.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.171
Beautiful.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.425
All right, man, injectors are wired.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.553
<i>So, when the ECU in the engine
is not communicating,</i>

26:36.637 --> 26:39.723
<i>there's just no way of knowing
what is wrong with it.</i>

26:39.807 --> 26:42.030
<i>There's no way of knowing what it needs.</i>

26:42.976 --> 26:46.105
<i>It's basically like a baby crying
and not knowing what it needs.</i>

26:46.396 --> 26:49.862
<i>You can't communicate with it,
so, it's like speaking baby language.</i>

26:50.359 --> 26:52.861
<i>So, the computer clears that up for me.
It tells me,</i>

26:53.112 --> 26:55.405
<i>"Okay, it needs more spark.
It needs fuel.</i>

26:55.531 --> 26:58.849
<i>It's not getting a signal from here.
It's not getting a signal from there."</i>

26:59.785 --> 27:03.330
<i>So, it's a language
that the computer translates to me.</i>

27:07.751 --> 27:09.002
We got fuel?

27:09.294 --> 27:11.184
Yeah, fuel pump's going,

27:11.379 --> 27:14.258
we're connected.
So now, all we need to do is crank.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.569
- Crank it and we'll see.
- Crank and see.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.429
- We'll see if it syncs, it starts.
- All right. Here goes.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.390
Gonna give it... This is it.

27:24.893 --> 27:25.894
What was that?

27:26.854 --> 27:28.313
- Is the...
- Is it in gear?

27:28.605 --> 27:30.290
Is it in gear?

27:30.566 --> 27:31.806
Yeah, it's in neutral.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.318
Try it again.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.702
It's, like, stuck on the trans
or something.

27:41.869 --> 27:44.347
<i>Right now, at this point,
I can't even think what else I can do.</i>

27:44.371 --> 27:48.500
- I just have to get it running and fueled.
- That's gonna be fixed like that tomorrow.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.744
- Hopefully.
- I don't see why not.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.043
I'm telling you,
we're gonna need a shot of nitrous.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.548
I think I need a shot of vodka.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.385
That's what I need. And tequila.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.700
<i>I notice in racing,
the guys that come up to me</i>

28:03.807 --> 28:05.726
just kind of hang back
and don't say anything

28:05.809 --> 28:07.867
until you can prove yourself

28:08.020 --> 28:10.397
in a respectable way in the lineup.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.984
And if you can't, they're not gonna
give you the time of day.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.069
And then there are those few that...

28:16.153 --> 28:19.406
Even if you do,
they don't want to acknowledge it.

28:19.948 --> 28:24.912
And Ferrari really calls out women
in racing, which is kind of cool.

28:24.995 --> 28:28.624
Like yesterday, in my last race,
there was a little girl.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.877
She was about eight, and her mom and dad
were standing there with the camera.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.337
And I had the trophy,

28:33.420 --> 28:35.851
and the little girl came up to me
and asked if she could...

28:37.174 --> 28:38.426
hold the trophy.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.510
<i>So, I kneeled down with her,</i>

28:40.594 --> 28:43.382
<i>and the mom goes,
"She loves watching you race."</i>

28:43.805 --> 28:45.515
<i>It's moments like that where you're like,</i>

28:45.599 --> 28:47.809
"If I can just make
that little girl feel like,

28:47.893 --> 28:51.396
hey, I'm a girl, and I'm doing this.
You can do the same."

28:51.897 --> 28:52.940
It's a great feeling.

28:54.524 --> 29:00.405
<i>When I pull up on race day, I'm sure
the guys are gonna be just like, "Okay."</i>

29:01.114 --> 29:03.784
<i>They'll be seeing a Ferrari
and expecting a man,</i>

29:03.867 --> 29:06.036
<i>but they'll be shocked when they see me.</i>

29:08.455 --> 29:09.706
Right, you want to crank it?

29:10.332 --> 29:11.812
You see where it says RPM right here?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.253
See if it moves from stall.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.964
It's not picking up the RPM
from the distributor.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.176
No, stall.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.761
It says stall.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.888
Hang on. Let me call John.

29:25.722 --> 29:28.475
<i>The distributor is what we need
to get the spark to make the car run.</i>

29:28.642 --> 29:31.353
<i>Without it, we're screwed.
The car's not gonna run.</i>

29:34.731 --> 29:37.791
Hey, John, quick question. Can I use
this distributor you got in the shop?

29:37.891 --> 29:39.172
Our distributor took a shit.

29:39.422 --> 29:40.868
So, let me hear back from you.

29:40.968 --> 29:43.655
If I don't hear back from you, I'll go
ahead and use it and replace it later.

29:43.679 --> 29:45.951
Thanks, buddy.
All right, ready? Here we go.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.206
All right.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.333
Go again?

29:55.377 --> 29:56.378
Let it go.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.630
One more time.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.412
Something ain't right.

30:06.530 --> 30:07.579
We got no power.

30:07.799 --> 30:09.433
No power. Turn it on?

30:10.392 --> 30:12.811
Because the relay's over here clicking,
and it's reading it.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.314
Yeah, no spark.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.986
<i>For the last few weeks
we've been working on this car,</i>

30:21.278 --> 30:23.697
<i>everything that could go wrong on this car
has gone wrong.</i>

30:23.780 --> 30:26.908
<i>We got the car to start.
It was running good. It was running great.</i>

30:26.992 --> 30:29.077
<i>Now we've got everything
to do all over again,</i>

30:29.161 --> 30:31.281
<i>because we can't figure out
what's wrong with the car.</i>

30:31.872 --> 30:32.914
- Ready?
- Yeah.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.045
- Again?
- Yeah.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.763
- One more time?
- Yeah.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.073
You happy now?

31:07.991 --> 31:09.034
You did it.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.787
- Yeah, finally, so.
- Finally. Hey, it's worth it.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.400
Nobody gets it. This is nothing.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.427
This is just the beginning
of the beginning

31:15.457 --> 31:17.292
- of the beginning of an ass-whooping.
- Yeah.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.753
But everyone who doubted us,
they can bite me.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.630
So, we proved them all wrong.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.508
<i>This thing has come to life.
It is an animal.</i>

31:24.591 --> 31:27.259
<i>It's not gonna be a regular car.
It's a monster.</i>

31:30.722 --> 31:33.558
<i>What you're seeing now
is just the beginning. We're not done.</i>

31:33.642 --> 31:36.186
<i>I'll be excited when we kick
that Ferrari's ass.</i>

31:41.274 --> 31:44.528
So, looking at what we've done
so far with the wheels,

31:44.945 --> 31:47.455
<i>the three batteries, little odds and ends,</i>

31:47.975 --> 31:50.700
<i>we've saved a little over 300 pounds.</i>

31:51.243 --> 31:55.341
<i>With me in it, it's 5,450.
This is a 5,500-pound car.</i>

31:56.248 --> 31:58.708
<i>But it's still, it's three car lengths
faster than we were,</i>

31:58.917 --> 32:01.294
<i>so, we're headed in a positive direction.</i>

32:03.755 --> 32:05.090
- Everything ready?
- Yeah.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.217
Cross your fingers.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.367
You did it. I love you.

32:32.868 --> 32:33.869
Thank you.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.363
We lost what, three, 400 pounds.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.327
We gained a couple hundred horsepower.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.723
We're gonna beat some fucking ass
out there.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.183
Let's see who can beat up this big bitch.

32:45.195 --> 32:46.555
<i>My car's not running yet,</i>

32:46.677 --> 32:49.176
<i>but fortunately
I have the best team on it,</i>

32:49.509 --> 32:51.261
<i>so, I know it'll be up
and running tomorrow.</i>

32:52.345 --> 32:53.508
<i>And I know I can win.</i>

32:55.265 --> 32:58.393
<i>I want to win
because I want this car to win.</i>

32:58.935 --> 33:01.005
I really feel like it's more about the car

33:01.155 --> 33:03.023
than about the person driving it,

33:03.356 --> 33:06.786
and I want to just have the thrill
of driving the winning car

33:06.902 --> 33:09.196
and bragging that,
"Yeah, it was a Ferrari."

33:14.034 --> 33:16.786
<i>I don't intend on losing.
I don't want to lose.</i>

33:16.870 --> 33:19.802
<i>I don't want to hear about losing
for the next five, ten years.</i>

33:19.956 --> 33:22.083
<i>You can win 100 races but that one loss?</i>

33:22.167 --> 33:24.007
<i>You'll hear about it
for the rest of your life.</i>

33:24.252 --> 33:27.506
<i>I want to make my family, the Brotherhood
of Street Racers, really proud.</i>

33:29.716 --> 33:33.345
I know this car has enough horsepower
to beat any car.

33:33.803 --> 33:37.224
And I know I'll never beat a supercar
going around a turn

33:37.307 --> 33:39.714
or I'll beat a supercar on the freeway.
I don't know that.

33:40.268 --> 33:44.064
But I'll tell you what, from light
to light, I sure will give them hell.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.219
<i>You know what?
We made it, and I'm happy</i>

34:16.243 --> 34:17.614
<i>I'm here. You know, I'm happy.</i>

34:17.889 --> 34:20.659
If somebody beats me, I'm gonna
give them a big hug and congratulate them.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.764
<i>Because I know what it's gonna take
to beat this car.</i>

34:26.106 --> 34:27.774
Looks like we got a fellow lowrider.

34:30.150 --> 34:31.831
<i>We've been at this
all-night long.</i>

34:32.070 --> 34:33.572
<i>We got Frankenstein going.</i>

34:33.697 --> 34:36.097
<i>And now Frankenstein's
gonna terrorize the village.</i>

34:37.367 --> 34:38.934
This guy might have tricks.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.371
I like his style, though.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.667
That thing passes inspection? Jesus.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.337
I want to shake this guy's hand.
This is a sleeper.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.899
- How you doing?
- Doing good. How you guys doing?

34:51.922 --> 34:52.966
Good.

34:53.632 --> 34:55.833
- I like your Impala.
- Oh, man, I love what you've got.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.721
The nice touches
you've done to this thing.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.306
- I'm Scott.
- I'm Fabian.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.642
- Nice to meet you.
- It's just literally a throwaway car.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.555
Yeah, it's nice.
It's nice... nice throwaway sleeper.

35:07.731 --> 35:08.857
What the fuck is that?

35:09.441 --> 35:10.734
What's up with that?

35:11.943 --> 35:13.733
That thing is bad-ass.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.572
That's a sleeper.

35:16.323 --> 35:17.574
He don't even want to start it.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.620
He doesn't even want us to hear it.
What a bad-ass.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.427
Dude, this guy's total sleeper mode.

35:24.902 --> 35:26.207
What a dickhead.

35:27.667 --> 35:28.756
Start it up!

35:30.045 --> 35:31.546
Motherfucker.

35:33.608 --> 35:36.608
Yo, yo, yo.
Let's go take a look at Team Celica.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.136
- Peanut.
- Peanut, Javier.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.763
- Scott.
- Scoot. Nice to meet you.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.407
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Manny.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.433
Man, you guys didn't even want
to start it for us?

35:44.025 --> 35:45.362
You guys are good.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.355
- Well...
- It's stock. It's just a stock.

35:48.438 --> 35:49.522
Yeah, I see it. I see.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.567
<i>They don't know
that it actually has some issues,</i>

35:52.651 --> 35:54.490
<i>so, I'm just gonna keep toying with them.</i>

35:55.945 --> 35:57.795
I don't know of anybody else around here.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.200
You know, it's just...

36:01.117 --> 36:02.118
I lost connection.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.749
All I need now is a red Ferrari
with a female driving it with big boobs.

36:07.832 --> 36:08.833
I'd be fucked.

36:09.918 --> 36:10.919
No chance.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.672
If it's yellow and a guy, we got him.

36:16.841 --> 36:17.967
Okay, boys.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.012
Let's see what you've got.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.052
What is that?

36:24.182 --> 36:26.059
We're in... We're in good shape boys.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.924
It's yellow, with a fucking Rolls Royce
behind it.

36:29.131 --> 36:30.647
What a sick bastard.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.891
It's a girl driving it.
You ain't getting beat by a girl.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.099
No, I'm driving.

36:41.366 --> 36:44.703
Well, it's yellow. So, that's...
I had a mental block about red.

36:44.828 --> 36:45.995
So, I'm feeling good.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.289
<i>Let's hope it's not a female.</i>

36:51.334 --> 36:52.335
Okay, hi.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.587
Oh, my God.

36:57.090 --> 37:01.329
Jesus Christ. I knew it. I felt it.
You know, I felt it.

37:02.345 --> 37:03.805
Yellow and a female.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.477
Oh, my God, I swear, if I lose...

37:07.392 --> 37:09.662
Come on, we should...
Maybe we should all hug her.

37:09.686 --> 37:10.770
Please.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.065
I'm gonna throw up.

37:16.165 --> 37:17.620
- Hi, I'm Lisa.
- Hello, there. I'm Scott.

37:17.644 --> 37:18.963
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.155
I'm Fabian, nice to meet you.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.240
- Fabian? Nice to meet you too.
- Yeah.

37:23.199 --> 37:26.286
- So, you guys had fun preparing?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot of fun.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.723
- What'd you do, detail it, wax it?
- I think your job is gonna be...

37:28.747 --> 37:31.187
- Was a lot more fun than what mine was.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.292
I didn't have to do much.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.931
I know you didn't have to do much,
you took it to the car wash. Yeah.

37:34.955 --> 37:35.956
Yeah.

37:35.957 --> 37:39.299
<i>Being a woman in racing,
I've been prepped a little mentally,</i>

37:39.382 --> 37:42.802
<i>and had situations where I, kind of,
get that shocked look.</i>

37:43.219 --> 37:45.180
So, I wasn't completely surprised.

37:45.388 --> 37:50.643
But it was fun seeing the lineup
of guys all together,

37:50.727 --> 37:52.228
<i>and they all had the same look.</i>

37:52.437 --> 37:54.355
- Does it look souped up to you?
- No.

37:54.481 --> 37:55.899
- It's stock?
- I think so.

37:55.982 --> 37:59.490
Holy shit! That looks like
a 10,000-dollar steering wheel.

38:00.648 --> 38:02.089
It is set on race.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.365
She's Mario Andretti's daughter?

38:04.532 --> 38:06.242
- No way, really?
- No, that's what I feel.

38:07.072 --> 38:08.161
She's somebody serious.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.419
<i>Failure is not part of my life.</i>

38:16.544 --> 38:19.506
<i>I will not accept it,
and if anything does fail,</i>

38:19.589 --> 38:23.134
<i>I will strive to turn that around
into a success.</i>

38:23.802 --> 38:25.470
All right, that was the last test.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.618
<i>Before we get
into the drivers' meeting,</i>

38:50.642 --> 38:52.080
<i>I want to unfortunately mention</i>

38:52.163 --> 38:55.250
<i>that one of our competitors
was unable to run today.</i>

38:55.458 --> 38:57.085
<i>Sometimes you do everything right,</i>

38:57.168 --> 38:59.379
<i>you do everything you can,
and you can't run.</i>

39:00.839 --> 39:04.719
The reality of this was
that we had big issues and big problems.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.544
And that was with the ECU,

39:06.928 --> 39:09.013
the computer for the vehicle
was just fried.

39:10.014 --> 39:13.439
Therefore, it's not even powering
anything in the vehicle anymore.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.728
It's like cutting your head off.

39:20.608 --> 39:23.987
<i>Man, if I could just prove
to everybody and my brother</i>

39:24.195 --> 39:26.239
<i>that I could beat a Ferrari,
it'd be so beautiful.</i>

39:26.781 --> 39:29.844
<i>They're not gonna intimidate me.
They're not gonna be in my head at all.</i>

39:29.868 --> 39:33.052
<i>I'm only worried about me and this car,
and that's where I'm gonna be racing.</i>

39:33.127 --> 39:35.902
<i>I'm gonna be racing myself
and that's how you win.</i>

39:37.000 --> 39:40.336
<i>This is completely out of my realm.
I've never done drag racing,</i>

39:40.461 --> 39:43.506
<i>so, I'm really looking forward
to this experience.</i>

39:46.426 --> 39:49.095
<i>We represent budget.
We represent anybody can do it.</i>

39:49.345 --> 39:51.764
<i>You know, you don't have to have
a lot of money to do it.</i>

39:51.848 --> 39:54.017
<i>We put this together with no money.</i>

39:54.517 --> 39:56.603
<i>Her tires cost more than a whole car.</i>

39:57.478 --> 40:01.232
<i>I've got a little bit
of a tentative reaction with that Impala,</i>

40:01.316 --> 40:03.902
<i>because it was like, "Oh my,
there's some stuff going on there."</i>

40:04.193 --> 40:06.821
<i>So, there's some competition
over there for sure.</i>

40:07.906 --> 40:09.186
<i>I don't know about the Cutlass.</i>

40:09.449 --> 40:12.577
<i>We're just gonna have to wait and see,
but I know he's ready to go</i>

40:12.660 --> 40:14.495
<i>and ready to rock,
and he wants to win too.</i>

40:14.579 --> 40:16.340
<i>So, he's gonna give it his best.</i>

40:16.831 --> 40:19.751
<i>We're gonna race her and the car.
And that's the thing.</i>

40:19.834 --> 40:22.921
<i>If we have a Ferrari with an okay driver,
we're gonna slaughter it.</i>

40:23.004 --> 40:25.564
<i>But if we got a Ferrari
with a good driver, it's gonna be a race.</i>

40:26.758 --> 40:28.903
<i>I'm gonna go for her throat
just like she's any other man.</i>

40:28.927 --> 40:30.327
<i>I'm not gonna think male or female.</i>

40:30.887 --> 40:32.180
<i>I'm gonna go after her.</i>

40:47.795 --> 40:50.509
<i>I'm not scared of this Ferrari.
This Impala's gonna beat its ass.</i>

40:54.285 --> 40:55.662
<i>Failure's not an option.</i>

41:28.486 --> 41:29.862
Yay, I got a first place.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.283
Beautiful.

41:36.551 --> 41:38.121
- Hey, baby.
- My God.

41:38.538 --> 41:39.539
I love you, guys.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.624
<i>I'm shocked and sad I didn't win the race.</i>

41:41.833 --> 41:45.882
<i>I did it for my brother Tony,
but I know he's smiling at me right now.</i>

41:47.171 --> 41:51.175
Hey, yeah, I was just glad to see them,
like, two cars in the background, yes.

41:51.384 --> 41:54.178
I would have been disqualified.
I left so early, and the car went...

41:55.555 --> 41:56.806
- And it left.
- You got third.

41:56.889 --> 41:59.017
- You got third. I got last.
- You're NA.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.852
Yeah, well, it was girl power all the way.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.199
- I'm DNF. Did not finish.
- DNFs.

42:03.279 --> 42:04.373
<i>And I'm still upset,</i>

42:04.397 --> 42:06.232
<i>because I know
that if my car was working</i>

42:06.315 --> 42:08.359
<i>and running the way it was supposed
to be running,</i>

42:08.443 --> 42:12.321
<i>I have no doubt that I would've beat
everybody on that, including the supercar.</i>

42:13.740 --> 42:15.843
- How fast is this son of a gun, huh?
- Fucking bad-ass.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.160
This bad-ass car?

42:18.161 --> 42:19.245
Fast car, huh?

42:19.495 --> 42:22.373
After the quarter-mile,
she probably hit 160, 170.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.940
<i>Do you know how fast she was going?</i>

42:24.667 --> 42:27.211
I had a great time. It was a blast.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.135
Those guys on each side of me,
and not knowing what was going to happen.

42:30.759 --> 42:32.675
<i>And I felt on the right,
he had a good launch,</i>

42:32.759 --> 42:35.678
<i>then the Ferrari just did its magic
and took off.</i>

42:39.390 --> 42:42.810
<i>It was a fun experience, drag racing.
Never done it.</i>

42:44.103 --> 42:45.229
When I seen her passing me,

42:45.313 --> 42:48.649
I kind of felt my brother laugh at me
for a second, I think, I don't know.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.095
Or it was me laughing at myself
but I felt something. Yeah.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.155
<i>How much she beat me by?
Ten, 12 car lengths, she probably did.</i>

42:54.521 --> 42:55.907
<i>I don't know, I let go of the gas</i>

42:55.990 --> 42:58.785
when I saw her ass so far ahead.
I'm like, "Holy shit."

43:00.578 --> 43:02.848
<i>She is just tough as any man out here.</i>

43:02.968 --> 43:04.499
<i>You know, I really respect her.</i>

43:06.459 --> 43:07.799
<i>For me and the Brotherhood,</i>

43:07.823 --> 43:10.004
<i>we're mostly
wanting to tell Willie a story.</i>

43:10.588 --> 43:13.382
<i>We beat ourselves up to get here
and we still never quit.</i>

43:13.591 --> 43:15.009
<i>And that's the bottom line.</i>

43:16.094 --> 43:17.803
<i>It feels great winning the race,</i>

43:17.898 --> 43:20.139
<i>not just for my car and my driving skills,</i>

43:20.223 --> 43:21.682
<i>but for all the women out there.</i>

43:22.225 --> 43:24.894
<i>It shows we can be as good
as any man in a race car.</i>
