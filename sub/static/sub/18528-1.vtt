04:07.815 --> 04:09.850
- (door opens)
- (footsteps)

04:16.290 --> 04:18.625
Mom, I'm heading out.

04:18.659 --> 04:22.296
Oh, honey, you look...

04:23.297 --> 04:24.998
You're so beautiful.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.434
You're leaving early?

04:26.467 --> 04:28.502
Yeah, I'm meeting
Camilla first.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.237
Well, I'm really proud
of you for going.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.705
Even if you don't have a...

04:33.841 --> 04:35.142
I didn't--
I didn't mean it like that.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.144
- I just--
- I know what you meant.

04:37.177 --> 04:40.481
(sighs) You know,
you could always ask Gabe.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.983
(scoffs)
I'll see you later.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.652
- Promise me you'll have fun.
- Yeah.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.186
- Take lots of pictures.
- Okay.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.194
- (birds cawing)
- (footsteps)

05:01.234 --> 05:03.070
(door shuts)

05:16.550 --> 05:18.552
(door squeaks open)

05:20.488 --> 05:22.490
(squeaking)

05:24.224 --> 05:26.226
Boo!
(laughing)

05:26.259 --> 05:28.362
Camilla, that's not cool.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.197
Where were you?
I thought we were
meeting out front.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.700
Sorry, my parents insisted
on taking photos of me

05:32.733 --> 05:34.702
from like
50 different angles.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.239
- We're still doing this, right?
- Yeah.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.610
- Where's your stuff?
- It's in my locker.
Let's go.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.814
(both laughing)

05:46.847 --> 05:49.783
Do you think we can return our
dresses and get our money back?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.854
What are you gonna do
if your mom finds out?

05:53.887 --> 05:57.057
I don't know.
It's better to ask
for forgiveness, you know?

05:57.090 --> 05:58.726
If we get busted,
I'm dead.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.060
What are they gonna do,

06:00.093 --> 06:01.529
ground you till the end
of the schoolyear?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.764
Yeah, good point.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.065
(both laugh)

06:07.735 --> 06:09.870
How'd you find out about
this anti-prom thing anyway?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.739
Max invited me
to the group.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.541
- Max is going?
- Yeah.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.743
- Why so surprised?
- Nothing.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.178
I just thought
you were over him.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.880
'Kay, I lied.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.649
Great.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.052
What's that
supposed to mean?

06:25.085 --> 06:27.788
I'm just saying
that being invited to
some party in the woods

06:27.821 --> 06:30.458
- is not the same as a date.
- Says you.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.160
I just...
Max is...

06:35.395 --> 06:38.065
- Just be careful.
- I don't have to be careful.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.501
That's why you're coming.
Hello?

06:42.269 --> 06:44.905
Miss you, too.
See you soon.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.908
Hey. Oh, Heather.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.243
I thought for sure
you'd be going to prom.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.379
I went last year.
I'm over it.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.748
Yeah, no need
to explain it to me.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.617
Prom is so clichÃÂ©.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.251
I was gonna say lame.

06:58.285 --> 07:01.989
Yeah. Rob should be
showing up pretty soon.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.626
- Where's it at anyway?
- Um, some cabin in
Shadow Creek.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.227
That I think
Tony found.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.263
Wait, Tony,
like, Tony-Tony?

07:10.297 --> 07:12.432
Isn't he, like, 30?

07:12.466 --> 07:14.935
Yeah. We hang out
with him sometimes.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.437
He buys the beer.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.508
- And what's a party
without beer?
- Max.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.343
Hey, Camilla.
What's up?

07:23.376 --> 07:25.178
(giggles)
Hey, Max.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.949
Max:
Hey, Heather.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.419
Oh, Heather, it's Gabe.
Is he really coming?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.522
Good question.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.456
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.891
What are you doing here?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.360
You invited me.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.296
Gabe, I've invited you
to a million things.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.465
- It's not like you ever come.
- I know.

07:45.499 --> 07:49.069
I just... this is
my first time ever being
to the football field.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.472
I hate this place.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.208
- We're not here for
the football field.
- I know, I just figured,

07:55.242 --> 07:58.178
you know, I should do
at least one kind of
normal thing before graduation.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.313
Anti-prom is not normal.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.883
I guess that's
the appeal.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.787
- Good.
- (horn honks)

08:06.820 --> 08:09.322
Oh, Rob's here.
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's go.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.358
(music playing on radio)

08:17.865 --> 08:19.700
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.637
Yo, yo.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.774
The anti-prom express
is now boarding.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.343
Welcome to my limo.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.582
- What, no mini bar?
- Get in there.

08:35.616 --> 08:39.019
- I'd settle for seats.
- Or seatbelts.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.589
Hey, chill.
Van's built like a tank.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.456
(door shuts)

08:49.529 --> 08:51.431
I feel like
we're being smuggled.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.135
(car starts)

09:07.815 --> 09:09.817
(music playing in distance)

09:20.060 --> 09:21.962
This is the cabin?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.597
It looks more like a shack.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.608
(chatter)

09:42.916 --> 09:44.752
My people!

09:44.785 --> 09:48.055
What's up, man?
Welcome to anti-prom.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.923
Oh, it's good to see you.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.292
- Hey.
- You been working out?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.727
Oh, thanks.
We got snacks.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.095
We got drinks.
Come on in.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.464
Come on in, ladies.
Ladies.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.406
It's a rager.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.108
Oh, crap, I left
my phone in the van.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.110
You want me
to come with or...

10:10.143 --> 10:12.145
It's like 50 feet.
I can handle it.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.181
I meant more for me.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.756
Hello?

10:56.523 --> 10:58.525
(low groaning)

11:30.557 --> 11:32.225
- (horn honks)
- (gasps)

11:32.259 --> 11:34.394
- (laughing)
- Man: We're at Shadow Creek.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.698
Creeps.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.911
Max:
Tell 'em, Tony.

11:50.944 --> 11:55.115
Tell 'em what they say
about Shadow Creek.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.118
I don't know, man.
They say a lot of things.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.053
I don't know if these girls
wanna hear all of 'em.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.890
And cue
lame ghost story.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.458
- It's all B.S.
- Not all of it.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.228
Right, you mean the story
that's supposed to scare
the girls

12:08.261 --> 12:10.263
into sleeping with
the guys to protect them?

12:10.297 --> 12:12.065
I don't think you need help
in that department, Bethany.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.967
Hey, man, I could use
all the help I can get.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.136
Stop it.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.872
All right, so,
you've all heard the story

12:18.906 --> 12:20.740
of the doctor who murdered
his wife and kids?

12:20.774 --> 12:23.376
- No way.
- It's true.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.245
No, seriously,
you can look it up.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.815
- (music stops)
- Back in the '80s,

12:27.848 --> 12:30.317
there was this doctor in town.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.319
Okay, he was a family man.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.587
Everybody liked him.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.925
Then one night, he went
for a hike in the woods.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.993
These woods.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.562
When he came back,
he was...

12:42.595 --> 12:45.332
he was different.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.835
And then he just snapped.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.938
Killed his wife.
Killed his kids.

12:50.971 --> 12:54.607
Killed anybody who was stupid
enough to come looking for him.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.344
- How did he kill 'em?
- Really wanna know?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.048
Yeah.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.019
- He cut out their hearts.
- Man: What?

13:06.053 --> 13:09.289
And then he ate 'em.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.659
- It's actually getting dumber.
- (chuckles)

13:12.692 --> 13:15.028
Yeah, but they
caught him, right?

13:15.062 --> 13:17.630
No. They never did.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.766
In fact, there's been
a rumor going around

13:19.799 --> 13:23.003
that he's isolating himself
somewhere in these woods.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.838
So he can't hurt anybody else.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.207
Let me guess,
in a cabin just
like this one.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.542
- (soft laughter)
- Not like this...

13:30.844 --> 13:32.412
this cabin.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.753
(laughter)

13:43.390 --> 13:46.126
Okay, well, I have to
go to the bathroom.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.329
Uh, Max, do you wanna
come watch the door for me?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.431
No, I'm good.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.833
Oh...

13:53.867 --> 13:55.835
Where was it again?

13:55.869 --> 13:59.039
Oh, it's the outhouse out back.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.578
(door opens, shuts)

14:15.355 --> 14:17.190
(door opens, shuts)

14:17.224 --> 14:20.193
Any other stories people have?

14:20.227 --> 14:22.229
(owl hooting)

14:25.732 --> 14:27.434
(door shuts)

14:27.467 --> 14:29.069
Max:
Heather.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.706
- Hey.
- Really glad you came.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.976
I didn't expect
to see you here.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.578
Surprise.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.714
So, what's wrong?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.616
Well, why are you
acting weird?

14:43.650 --> 14:45.885
You act like
I'm not even here.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.155
Are you pissed
about something?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.724
Do we really need
to do this right now?

14:51.758 --> 14:55.929
Well, I'm here
and you're here, so...

14:55.963 --> 14:58.265
So, we are gonna
do this right now.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.769
You're the only one who looks
like they don't wanna be here.

15:02.802 --> 15:06.573
- You and Gabe.
- Leave him out of this.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.242
Is he why you said no?

15:09.276 --> 15:11.578
Grow up.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.413
So, why'd you say no?

15:15.182 --> 15:16.616
Look, when you
turned me down to prom,

15:16.649 --> 15:18.585
I thought it was
because you had a date.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.087
- And then you show up to--
- Camilla: What?

15:23.957 --> 15:25.758
Wait, he asked you out?

15:25.792 --> 15:28.595
- Cam, it isn't like that.
- No, don't.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.498
- You should've just told me.
- Camilla.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.100
- Camilla!
- No, let her go.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.934
You're a total ass.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.440
You wanna know why
I said no to you, Max?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.609
'Cause I don't
date idiots.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.218
Camilla!

15:52.819 --> 15:54.654
Camilla!

15:58.225 --> 16:00.627
Camilla?

16:02.162 --> 16:03.796
Camilla!

16:05.032 --> 16:07.867
(chatter)

16:07.900 --> 16:09.869
(chatter)

16:10.970 --> 16:12.772
Oh, thank God
you're here.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.807
I think these guys are,
like, trying to roofie me
or something.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.710
- Have you seen Camilla?
- Uh, no, no.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.646
Hey, do you know
where Camilla went?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.514
Didn't she go to
the bathroom?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.985
- Why?
- I can't find her anywhere.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.167
- Camilla!
- Hey, is everything okay?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.269
(sighs)
It's complicated.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.407
- What are you doing here?
- What, we wanna help.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.009
Haven't you been
enough help already?
Just go back to the party.

16:50.043 --> 16:53.680
- We can't party
with people missing.
- Tony: Hold up.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.749
Can't go anywhere
without these.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.551
You guys have no idea
what's out there.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.388
There's poison oak,
bears, killer beavers.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.123
(chuckles)
Killer beavers?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.029
Heather: Camilla?

17:15.402 --> 17:17.170
Camilla!

17:17.204 --> 17:20.540
- Camilla!
- Hey, what happened anyway?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.342
People are jerks.
That's what happened.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.344
Hey, I'm standing right here.
I can hear you.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.348
- Okay, maybe
we should split up.
- Yes, good idea.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.550
- Bethany and I are
gonna split up.
- Wait.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.285
- And we're gonna go look...
- Rob, I wanna stay

17:32.319 --> 17:34.221
- with the rest of the group.
- You know what, whatever.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.265
(leaves rustling)

17:51.504 --> 17:53.473
(rustling)

18:03.950 --> 18:05.618
- (twig snaps)
- (gasps)

18:13.126 --> 18:15.295
Heather:
Camilla?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.867
What am I doing?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.636
(gasps)

18:23.670 --> 18:25.672
- (gagging)
- (phone vibrating)

18:30.677 --> 18:32.979
- Bethany: Is she picking up?
- She's still not answering.

18:33.012 --> 18:36.115
- (phone beeps)
- Camilla!

18:36.149 --> 18:37.950
Drama queen.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.086
Are you ever not awful?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.455
- No.
- (leaves rustling)

18:42.489 --> 18:45.458
What was that?

18:47.026 --> 18:50.297
Hey, guys.
Gotta come check this out.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.664
Come on.

19:02.008 --> 19:05.712
Rob: Well, that's creepy.
Did you know this was here?

19:05.745 --> 19:08.281
Tony: No, I've never
been out here before.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.683
Heather: Camilla?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.852
Maybe she's inside.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.554
Really?

19:14.587 --> 19:17.457
- Why don't you go inside?
- That's a good idea.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.259
Go.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.095
Guys, come on.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.666
Hey, come check
this out.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.535
Weird cables.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.045
Heather:
What are these lights for?

19:39.078 --> 19:42.382
Looks like somebody's trying
to capture Bigfoot or something.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.189
Nice.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.262
Oh, this place is a dump.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.365
Bethany: Uh, guys,
I think someone lives here.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.269
Yeah, never mind.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.604
Camilla would definitely
not be in here.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.612
And it looks like
it's the maid's day off.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.420
(sloshes)

20:23.290 --> 20:24.791
(screams)

20:33.666 --> 20:35.735
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell?

20:35.768 --> 20:37.570
- Gabe: That's disgusting.
- (all groaning)

20:37.604 --> 20:39.238
Tony: What, do you think
a bear did that?

20:39.272 --> 20:41.140
Rob: I don't think
a bear could do that.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.410
- Heather...
- (gasps)

20:44.344 --> 20:46.746
Camilla?
Thank God, you--

20:46.779 --> 20:48.348
Turn it off.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.586
- (flashlight clicks)
- We were looking for you.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.154
You had us scared to death.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.292
Are-- are you okay?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.096
Camilla,
what are you...

21:04.130 --> 21:06.999
- (screams) Camilla, stop!
- (roars)

21:07.033 --> 21:09.302
Help!

21:09.336 --> 21:11.137
Stop!

21:11.170 --> 21:13.940
Get off!
(screaming)

21:13.973 --> 21:16.242
- Tony: Hey, chill!
- Max: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.779
- Get off of her!
- (Camilla gagging)

21:19.812 --> 21:21.814
Bethany: Somebody should
call an ambulance.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.350
Rob:
We're in the middle of nowhere.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.951
Gabe: Let's get her
back to the van. Come on.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.218
You got her? You got her?

21:28.020 --> 21:30.022
(Camilla gagging continues)

21:31.858 --> 21:34.461
Put her down.
Get her down.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.928
What's wrong with her?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.664
Gabe: She's having like
a seizure or something.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.299
(van starts)

21:40.333 --> 21:42.168
Heather:
Just breathe, Camilla,
it's going to be okay.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.640
Yes, hello? It's an emergency.
My friend is having some
kind of seizure.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.308
- (lowered) Let me go.
- What the hell?

21:49.342 --> 21:51.344
(lowered)
I said let me go!

21:52.679 --> 21:54.414
- (tires squealing)
- Hey, watch it!

22:06.526 --> 22:08.528
(monitor beeping)

23:12.091 --> 23:13.993
Camilla?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.571
I'm so sorry.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.122
- (roars)
- (screaming)

23:43.155 --> 23:44.423
- No!
- Heather, it's okay.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.493
It's okay. I'm here.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.061
Heather, it's okay.
You're all right.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.597
- You're all right.
- It's okay. It's okay, Heather.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.499
It's okay. Just sit back.
Try to relax.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.400
Everything's gonna be
all right.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.469
Take a deep breath.

23:56.503 --> 23:59.672
I'm Doctor Cobb.
You're at Mercy Hospital.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.608
You were in
a car accident.

24:01.641 --> 24:04.276
You had a mild concussion,
but you're gonna be fine.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.312
Look at me for a sec.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.217
Are the--
are the others okay?

24:12.819 --> 24:16.823
- I'm sorry?
- My friends, are they okay?

24:16.856 --> 24:19.325
Most of them just suffered
minor injuries.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.960
Camilla?

24:25.464 --> 24:26.999
I'm sorry.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.673
How?

24:33.706 --> 24:36.709
Well, her injuries
from the crash were--

24:36.743 --> 24:38.778
No.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.780
Something was wrong
before the crash.

24:40.813 --> 24:44.150
We know.
It was a grand mal seizure.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.686
Which is rare in the case of
no history of epilepsy,

24:46.719 --> 24:48.454
but it can happen.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.489
We'll know more when they
complete the autopsy.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.662
- Does Dad know?
- Mom: I left him a message.

24:55.695 --> 24:58.698
He hasn't called back yet.
He'll call. I'm sure.

25:00.432 --> 25:03.135
Hey, Heather.
I'm Detective Smith.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.706
- How are you feeling?
- I've been better.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.908
I hate to bother you
right now, but, uh,

25:08.941 --> 25:11.711
I do have a couple of
questions I need to ask
if you're up to it.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.512
Is this really
necessary right now?

25:13.546 --> 25:16.015
Mom, it's fine.

25:18.785 --> 25:22.188
Now, last night,
did you see anyone strange
hanging out at the party?

25:22.221 --> 25:24.423
Anyone who looked like
they didn't belong?

25:26.225 --> 25:29.161
Okay, now this other cabin.

25:29.195 --> 25:33.065
As far as you know,
had any of your friends seen
this cabin before last night?

25:33.099 --> 25:35.101
No, but...

25:37.570 --> 25:40.840
- there was a body.
- Yeah, I know.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.709
We haven't
identified it yet.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.878
We were trying to find Camilla.
Something happened to her.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.714
- I-I saw something--
- I think that's enough--

25:47.747 --> 25:49.315
I think this is
enough for now.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.719
Okay.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.721
Feel better, Heather.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.392
Dr. Cobb: All right, Heather,
you just try and take it easy.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.461
I'm only gonna have you here
for a few more hours.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.463
I'm gonna try and get you
home so you can sleep

26:04.496 --> 26:06.098
in your own bed tonight, okay?

26:12.639 --> 26:14.641
(crickets chirping)

26:45.638 --> 26:47.006
Can I get you something?

26:48.140 --> 26:49.608
No, thanks. I'm okay.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.582
- Who are you calling?
- I haven't seen anyone
since the crash.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.317
I need to talk to Gabe.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.953
You wanna try talking to
your own mother first?

27:03.322 --> 27:05.457
I get this call
you're in a car crash,

27:05.491 --> 27:07.393
and I'm scared
half to death.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.596
I didn't know
where you were.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.699
You didn't go
to your prom.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.134
I mean,
what is all this?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.609
I know things haven't been
the same since your dad left.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.045
Camilla's gone, Mom.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.083
I know.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.222
It's awful.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.760
And it so easily
could've been you.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.634
Something was wrong with her.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.238
You kept saying that.
What?

27:52.271 --> 27:54.206
I don't know.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.508
I just...

27:56.542 --> 27:59.178
What was it?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.613
You're not gonna believe me.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.353
Camilla didn't die
from a seizure,

28:07.386 --> 28:09.121
or in that crash.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.303
(cell phone ringing)

28:30.642 --> 28:32.745
- (beeps)
- Hey.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.514
- Woman: Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm on my way home.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.016
- Why?
- Nothing.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.618
What's the matter?

28:39.651 --> 28:41.287
I just got worried about you
all of a sudden.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.756
- I don't know.
- I'm fine. I'm on my way home.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.525
- I'll see you
in a few minutes, okay?
- Okay.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.560
Okay, bye.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.262
(beeps)

28:50.296 --> 28:52.298
(papers shuffling)

29:20.659 --> 29:24.096
- Hey.
- (gasps)

29:24.130 --> 29:28.300
- Wanna try knocking?
- Sorry, the door was open.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.070
Listen, that other John Doe
that they found earlier.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.572
Yeah, it's pretty gruesome.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.309
- I pulled prints
and dental for you.
- Oh, thanks.

29:37.343 --> 29:41.080
- Did you get a look
at the girl yet?
- I just put her on ice.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.349
Somehow,
she got the worst of it.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.651
We're starting full autopsy
tomorrow, so I'll let you know.

29:45.684 --> 29:48.320
All right, well, thank you.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.364
(fluorescent light buzzing)

30:02.668 --> 30:04.236
(buzzing stops)

30:19.218 --> 30:20.586
(bang in distance)

30:22.521 --> 30:24.523
(creaking)

30:35.001 --> 30:36.835
(cell phone ringing)

30:40.839 --> 30:42.374
Damn.

30:46.712 --> 30:48.714
(ringing continues)

30:55.054 --> 30:57.056
(beeps)

30:57.089 --> 31:01.693
- Hello?
- Woman: I can never die.

31:01.727 --> 31:05.231
- Honey?
- I can never die.

31:06.865 --> 31:10.069
I can never die.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.686
- (growling)
- Whoa, whoa.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.721
(screaming)

31:55.447 --> 31:57.449
(bells tolling)

32:15.534 --> 32:17.469
I'll see you
at home, okay?

32:23.109 --> 32:24.776
Hey.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.847
We need to talk.

32:33.819 --> 32:36.155
Did you guys talk
to the police?

32:38.824 --> 32:40.092
Yeah.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.827
What did you tell them?

32:41.860 --> 32:44.030
Nothing really.
Camilla freaked out.

32:44.063 --> 32:47.466
- She was having a convulsion.
- But her voice...

32:47.499 --> 32:49.601
there was something else.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.604
- Didn't you see it?
- What are you talking
about, Heather?

32:52.638 --> 32:54.873
The doctor said
it was a seizure, okay?

32:54.906 --> 32:57.176
People can do stuff like that
when they're having a seizure.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.844
They-- I've seen it before.

32:58.877 --> 33:01.713
They even bite off
their own tongue.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.982
But you saw it.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.154
I don't know what I saw.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.860
So, I'm the only crazy one.

33:14.893 --> 33:18.330
None of you saw her eyes
or her mouth or that thing
that came out of it.

33:18.364 --> 33:21.167
Hey, we all got pretty
knocked around in that van.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.835
- Head trauma. Concussion.
- It wasn't just what I saw.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.837
I felt something.

33:25.871 --> 33:27.839
- Like a presence.
- Rob: Come on,

33:27.873 --> 33:29.975
we saw a pretty gruesome
corpse back there.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.677
Camilla having a seizure
in the van.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.213
The crash.
It was a lot.

33:34.246 --> 33:37.183
So, none of you saw anything?

34:26.732 --> 34:29.400
- (screams)
- (gasps)

35:11.810 --> 35:13.812
(line ringing)

35:15.481 --> 35:18.116
- Gabe: Hello?
- Hey, are you busy?

35:18.150 --> 35:20.419
Uh, no. Why?
What's up?

35:20.452 --> 35:23.789
- Do you think
you can come over?
- Uh, sure.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.615
Thanks for coming.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.818
My mom's working late again
and I don't feel like
being alone.

35:52.851 --> 35:55.521
Yeah, I don't blame you.

35:55.554 --> 35:58.224
How was the, uh,
how was the funeral?

35:58.257 --> 36:01.360
I don't know.
The minister didn't
even know her.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.462
Why didn't you go?

36:03.495 --> 36:06.164
I just didn't think I knew her
well enough to be honest.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.538
You know, this whole time
I've lived next to you,

36:12.571 --> 36:16.141
I've never, like, actually
been in your room, you know?

36:16.174 --> 36:18.043
Like, even-even when
we were little kids.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.182
Are you okay?

36:24.216 --> 36:26.184
You want the truth,
or do you want me to lie?

36:26.218 --> 36:29.455
Whatever-- whatever
makes you feel better.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.596
Everyone thinks
I'm crazy.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.432
I don't know.
I think I'm crazy.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.170
I know I saw something.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.273
Yeah, I saw
something, too.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.308
Right before the crash.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.980
I know. I'm sorry.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.716
You guys were close.

37:00.252 --> 37:04.456
Camilla and I were planning
on boarding together
next year at State.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.425
I was thinking about
going there.

37:06.458 --> 37:09.961
Except, I don't think they have
what I'm looking for, though.

37:09.995 --> 37:13.832
I'm thinking, um,
professional figure skating.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.438
You should see my double axel.
It's pretty nice.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.515
(cans rattling)

38:04.350 --> 38:07.786
(metallic rustling)

38:07.819 --> 38:10.288
Hey, man, you take anything
out of that garage,

38:10.322 --> 38:12.991
I got a 12-gauge and some shells
with your name on it.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.694
- (growling)
- (gasps)

38:49.995 --> 38:51.697
(screaming)

39:43.048 --> 39:46.351
(line ringing)

39:46.384 --> 39:48.587
Recording: Please leave
your message after the tone.

39:48.620 --> 39:51.256
- (beeps)
- Hey, Dad.

39:51.289 --> 39:55.561
You have a weird robot
for a voicemail now.

39:55.594 --> 39:59.364
Don't know if you changed
your number or...

39:59.397 --> 40:02.601
Anyway, uh, call me back.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.269
I miss you.

40:04.302 --> 40:06.071
Okay, bye.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.038
- (groans)
- (gasps)

40:50.616 --> 40:52.183
Tony?

40:55.153 --> 40:57.022
What the hell
are you doing here?

40:59.691 --> 41:02.127
(groans)

41:02.160 --> 41:04.229
I just felt like
I should be here.

41:06.331 --> 41:09.535
Okay... why?

41:12.170 --> 41:14.806
I don't...
I don't feel so well.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.142
I can't...

41:17.175 --> 41:19.344
Do you want me
to call someone or...

41:19.377 --> 41:21.379
No, I just...

41:22.848 --> 41:25.316
I just wanna sit here
for a sec.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.485
Okay.

41:27.519 --> 41:30.155
I'll be right back.

41:34.359 --> 41:36.027
(sliding door shuts)

41:39.665 --> 41:42.000
(line ringing)

41:42.033 --> 41:44.536
- Bethany: Hello?
- Bethany, it's Heather.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.672
Heather, what time is it?

41:46.705 --> 41:49.708
Listen, Tony is at my house.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.543
- What?
- Tony, your beer friend.

41:51.577 --> 41:53.679
- He just showed up
at my house.
- What?

41:53.712 --> 41:55.513
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

41:55.547 --> 41:58.016
- He's acting kind of strange.
- Oh, my God.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.951
What a weirdo.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.621
Hold on.

42:04.422 --> 42:06.191
He might be leaving.

42:06.224 --> 42:08.927
Do you want me
to call the cops?

42:08.960 --> 42:12.230
No, no. Just stay on the phone
for a second, will you?

42:20.606 --> 42:21.973
Tony?

42:24.776 --> 42:27.078
Bethany: That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

42:27.112 --> 42:29.114
Hold on.

42:29.147 --> 42:32.017
Heather, are you there?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.985
Heather:
Oh, my God.

42:36.588 --> 42:38.724
- Heather?
- (gasps)

42:38.757 --> 42:42.527
- You're gonna die.
- Bethany?

42:42.560 --> 42:45.063
- (lowered)
You've been marked, Heather.
- What?

42:45.096 --> 42:47.065
You're gonna die.

42:52.671 --> 42:54.105
(roaring)

43:10.355 --> 43:13.091
(screaming)

43:13.124 --> 43:14.693
(siren wails)

43:20.298 --> 43:22.433
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

43:22.467 --> 43:24.435
- Stay with her.
- (police radio chatter)

43:24.469 --> 43:27.272
Officer:
Dispatch, this is 2-23.
I got a possible 10-70.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.641
Please send back up.

43:53.732 --> 43:55.533
(gags)

43:55.566 --> 43:57.568
(bang in distance)

44:06.244 --> 44:07.679
(leaves rustling)

44:16.021 --> 44:18.489
- (siren wails)
- (police radio chatter)

44:25.363 --> 44:26.765
- Hi.
- Detective.

44:29.868 --> 44:33.404
Look, Heather,
I know it's been one
hell of a week for you.

44:33.438 --> 44:36.074
I am really only
trying to help.

44:36.107 --> 44:39.644
But we got a dead guy
in the woods where you guys
were having a party,

44:39.677 --> 44:43.181
and another guy from that
same party has been murdered

44:43.214 --> 44:47.152
in your backyard
in a very similar way.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.821
Then you can imagine
how traumatic this is.

44:49.855 --> 44:51.356
Detective Smith:
I understand.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.994
Look, guys, the FBI's gonna
be taking over this case.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.563
- I've spoken to a couple--
- Heather: There was
something else.

45:01.066 --> 45:05.103
- Outside with Tony?
- In the house.

45:05.136 --> 45:08.940
Someone else who?
Did you get a look
at the guy?

45:08.974 --> 45:11.709
It wasn't a guy.
It was something...

45:13.378 --> 45:15.080
It wasn't human.

45:17.248 --> 45:20.051
Okay.

45:20.085 --> 45:21.987
Well, why don't we
talk about that tomorrow?

45:26.491 --> 45:29.260
Angela, can I--
can I talk to you
over here for a second?

45:40.105 --> 45:42.107
(gagging)

46:03.628 --> 46:05.864
- (gasping)
- Heather, Heather. Heather.

46:08.633 --> 46:11.602
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have left you alone.

46:13.839 --> 46:15.673
Okay, you know that--
you know that "ridic" story

46:15.706 --> 46:17.408
that Tony was telling
back at the cabin?

46:17.442 --> 46:19.144
Well, I've been
doing some research,

46:19.177 --> 46:21.279
and there might be
some kind of truth
behind it.

46:23.381 --> 46:24.883
Yeah.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.796
(bird cawing)

46:46.905 --> 46:50.308
- Where were you?
- Oh, you know, just had
a fun time being interrogated.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.043
I couldn't really
just leave.

46:52.077 --> 46:53.845
You got a guilty conscience
about something, Gabe?

46:53.879 --> 46:56.181
- Shut up.
- Hey, whatever.

46:56.214 --> 46:59.517
Heather found
Tony's body
in her yard.

46:59.550 --> 47:01.786
You wanted us to meet here.
What's up?

47:01.819 --> 47:04.522
I-- I don't think...

47:06.757 --> 47:10.628
Have any of you
been seeing things?

47:10.661 --> 47:13.698
Things that you know
can't be real, but when
you're seeing them,

47:13.731 --> 47:15.833
- it's just...
- (laughs)

47:15.867 --> 47:20.138
Here we go again with
the strange feelings
and the odd presence.

47:20.171 --> 47:23.041
Tony was killed, Max.
In my own yard.

47:23.074 --> 47:26.311
It looked like something
burst out of him just like
that old man.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.513
- The dead guy in the woods?
- Yes.

47:28.546 --> 47:31.316
This thing isn't human,
and it's scary as hell.

47:31.349 --> 47:33.351
And I tried telling the cops,
and they don't believe me.

47:33.384 --> 47:36.054
But you guys
have to believe me.

47:36.087 --> 47:37.889
We think Tony's story
might be real.

47:37.923 --> 47:40.658
The one about the doctor
like 30 years ago.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.560
The cops linked
the crime scene

47:42.593 --> 47:45.663
to the serial killer
from the same time period.

47:45.696 --> 47:48.733
- We think there's,
like, a pattern.
- Tony's story from the party?

47:50.401 --> 47:51.937
Wow.

47:51.970 --> 47:54.172
Okay, yeah,
you guys are both crazy.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.174
The thing I saw in my house

47:56.207 --> 47:58.709
was the same thing that I saw
in the crash from Camilla.

47:58.743 --> 48:00.511
And Gabe saw it, too.

48:00.545 --> 48:02.413
But we're both
crazy, right?

48:02.447 --> 48:04.582
'Cause none of you
saw anything.

48:04.615 --> 48:06.985
You're all
freaking fine.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.155
Cuckoo.

48:14.225 --> 48:16.394
- I'm outta here.
- Yeah, where the hell
are you going?

48:16.427 --> 48:19.564
School. Okay,
I got tryouts next week.

48:19.597 --> 48:22.100
Coach doesn't give a rat's ass
about ghost stories.

48:22.133 --> 48:23.568
I gotta make the cut.

48:23.601 --> 48:25.937
What could the team
possibly do without you?

48:25.971 --> 48:28.473
You can't just
walk away from this.

48:28.506 --> 48:30.108
Two of our friends are dead.

48:30.141 --> 48:33.078
And I'm telling you that
this is some other worldly crap

48:33.111 --> 48:36.247
that we're dealing with,
and your response is
to go do squats?

48:36.281 --> 48:38.016
Actually, it's chest day.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.785
Okay?

48:40.818 --> 48:42.620
I'm sorry. I'm done.

48:42.653 --> 48:44.155
- Let me know how it goes, man.
- Wait.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.359
- What is this?
- Ouch.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.796
It's a bruise.
It's...

48:51.829 --> 48:53.498
From the crash.

48:59.770 --> 49:03.274
Yeah, Bethany told me
I was marked.

49:03.308 --> 49:04.809
- Huh?
- On the phone.

49:04.842 --> 49:07.512
You-- Something told me
that I was marked

49:07.545 --> 49:09.647
right before
I found Tony's body.

49:28.166 --> 49:30.635
All right,
what the hell
is going on here?

49:30.668 --> 49:32.770
Still think
we're crazy?

49:32.803 --> 49:34.972
This is seriously
freaking me out.

49:35.006 --> 49:39.377
I saw this before.
On that old man's arm.

49:39.410 --> 49:42.213
- We have to go
back to the cabin.
- Rob: Yeah, good luck.

49:42.247 --> 49:44.815
Cabin's a crime scene.
Cops have probably cleared
it out already.

49:44.849 --> 49:46.717
Well, what if they
missed something?

49:46.751 --> 49:48.153
What do you think
you're gonna find
that they didn't?

49:48.186 --> 49:50.521
We have to try something.
We need answers.

49:50.555 --> 49:54.159
No, you need
sleep, okay?

49:54.192 --> 49:55.926
And you guys
all need therapy.

50:01.532 --> 50:05.270
I'm sorry, Heather,
but I really don't
wanna go back there.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.606
Yeah, me neither.

50:12.443 --> 50:15.046
- Looks like it's just us.
- Can we use your car?

50:15.080 --> 50:16.581
Yeah. Yeah.

50:28.893 --> 50:30.661
You know, I'm sorry
I left you last night.

50:30.695 --> 50:33.864
No, it's fine.
I feel asleep right away anyway.

50:33.898 --> 50:37.034
After I left, you know, I went
home and I couldn't sleep.

50:37.068 --> 50:39.604
And for some reason,
I couldn't stop thinking about--

50:39.637 --> 50:42.039
- about that story
that Tony told us.
- (scoffs)

50:42.073 --> 50:43.908
No, that-- that's what I
thought, too.

50:43.941 --> 50:45.776
But, look, there might be
something to it.

50:45.810 --> 50:48.045
I overheard
the detectives talking,

50:48.079 --> 50:51.216
they said that in 1985,
there was a doctor.

50:51.249 --> 50:55.253
His son's dismembered body
was discovered in their house.

50:55.286 --> 50:56.954
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:56.987 --> 50:59.724
Then his wife and other son
went missing. It's crazy.

50:59.757 --> 51:01.226
Right before
they could arrest him,

51:01.259 --> 51:03.794
the doctor just disappeared.
Never found him.

51:03.828 --> 51:06.030
He's the prime suspect
in two other murder cases

51:06.063 --> 51:08.399
that fit the same
exact style.

51:08.433 --> 51:12.103
- It-- it's just
a little-- a little--
- Too much of a coincidence.

51:12.137 --> 51:13.404
Exactly.

51:14.172 --> 51:15.440
Wow.

51:38.129 --> 51:40.765
I was hoping it
was going to be less
creepy during the day.

51:41.766 --> 51:43.434
I was wrong.

51:47.338 --> 51:49.340
(music playing on radio)

51:52.810 --> 51:55.513
- (bones cracking)
- (door opens)

51:55.546 --> 51:58.783
Serrano, I thought
I told you to shower.

51:58.816 --> 52:01.952
- I got three more sets, Coach.
- You should've been here
on time.

52:01.986 --> 52:03.788
I'm not waiting on you.
Hit the showers.

52:03.821 --> 52:05.790
I'll lock up, Coach.
Let me finish.

52:08.559 --> 52:10.628
You better.

52:24.809 --> 52:26.811
(groans)

52:26.844 --> 52:28.846
(police radio chatter)

52:43.361 --> 52:45.463
What are you doing?
You can't touch that.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.332
What, you just knocked down
all the police tape.

52:47.365 --> 52:49.400
I'm not going in there
without anything.

53:00.044 --> 53:02.179
Looks like the guy
collected lamps.

53:02.213 --> 53:04.549
Gabe: Yeah. Weird.

53:16.227 --> 53:18.596
- (Gabe clears throat)
- Check this out.

53:18.629 --> 53:20.465
Yeah, they're, like,
all over the place.

53:32.877 --> 53:34.712
The mark.

53:34.745 --> 53:37.382
Whatever it is,
it was definitely here.

53:37.415 --> 53:39.550
How do you...

53:39.584 --> 53:41.386
Oh, yeah.

53:43.153 --> 53:45.089
This is what was in my house.

53:45.122 --> 53:48.593
It's like a shadow but alive.

53:50.761 --> 53:52.497
Yo, check this out right here.

53:55.933 --> 53:58.068
Heather: It's like
he was counting something.

53:58.102 --> 54:00.371
Or marking off his days.

54:00.405 --> 54:02.072
Or his victims.

54:02.106 --> 54:05.843
- (wind whistling)
- Wait, do you hear that?

54:07.278 --> 54:08.946
Yeah.

54:44.382 --> 54:46.484
- Wait, rewind it.
- (clicking)

54:46.517 --> 54:48.152
Okay, okay,
just let me do it.

54:52.189 --> 54:53.858
(groans)

55:10.341 --> 55:12.343
(door shuts)

55:19.517 --> 55:20.818
Coach?

55:29.193 --> 55:30.995
(locker bangs)

55:40.705 --> 55:43.173
Hey, who else is in here?

55:43.207 --> 55:46.644
(tape recorder clicking,
stops)

55:46.677 --> 55:48.646
Man on recording: I'm making
this recording in the hope

55:48.679 --> 55:51.882
that when I die
the truth might be known.

55:53.183 --> 55:56.020
They think I'm a murderer.

55:56.053 --> 55:58.856
That I killed my family.

55:58.889 --> 56:01.358
But what really killed
my wife and children

56:01.392 --> 56:05.663
is beyond anything
anyone could possibly imagine.

56:05.696 --> 56:08.766
We went on a camping trip,
but when we came back,

56:08.799 --> 56:11.869
something had happened
to my youngest son.

56:11.902 --> 56:14.572
He had a bruise
that didn't heal.

56:16.407 --> 56:18.075
(locker bangs)

56:31.956 --> 56:34.291
(lowered)
Do you know what pain is?

56:35.292 --> 56:37.294
Tony?

56:37.327 --> 56:39.564
(lowered)
It's weakness leaving the body.

56:41.098 --> 56:43.100
(roars)

56:54.344 --> 56:55.412
(roars)

57:02.953 --> 57:04.622
Rob: What?

57:06.190 --> 57:09.527
Officer! Officer,
somebody locked me in.

57:10.795 --> 57:12.597
Officer, let me out!

57:12.630 --> 57:14.565
Man on recording:
Once we were marked,

57:14.599 --> 57:16.801
it was only a matter of time.

57:16.834 --> 57:19.670
It consumed us all,
one by one,

57:19.704 --> 57:21.405
using us as hosts.

57:21.438 --> 57:24.241
Hiding, waiting.

57:24.274 --> 57:28.278
Waiting for the right moment
to take its next victim.

57:28.312 --> 57:31.381
- (chain rattling)
- Officer.

57:37.321 --> 57:39.289
Back away from the door.

57:39.323 --> 57:41.158
Get back!

57:47.832 --> 57:49.834
(crackling)

58:05.683 --> 58:07.317
(chain rattles)

58:07.351 --> 58:09.820
Officer?

58:10.420 --> 58:12.389
(gasps)

58:20.364 --> 58:21.431
(door bangs)

58:25.670 --> 58:27.672
(breathing heavily)

58:50.027 --> 58:53.030
We're marked.

58:53.063 --> 58:56.000
This thing isn't gonna stop
even if it kills us all.

58:56.033 --> 59:00.070
So he-- he came out here
to keep it away from
everybody else.

59:00.104 --> 59:02.039
And it worked
until now.

59:02.607 --> 59:04.208
Yeah.

59:04.241 --> 59:05.743
Yay, anti-prom.

59:09.246 --> 59:11.081
Grab that tape.

59:11.115 --> 59:13.183
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

59:13.217 --> 59:16.553
All these lights,
the generator where I found him.

59:16.587 --> 59:18.789
Look, I have an idea.
Let's go.

59:32.002 --> 59:35.072
- Knock it off.
- Come on.

59:35.105 --> 59:36.807
I'm serious.

59:36.841 --> 59:39.309
How can your brain
even be in this mode
right now?

59:39.343 --> 59:41.278
This is how I cope.

59:43.513 --> 59:46.884
- Is something wrong?
- Seriously?

59:46.917 --> 59:48.653
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah.

59:48.686 --> 59:51.221
Isn't that what a concerned
boyfriend is supposed to ask?

59:51.255 --> 59:53.457
Not if he already
knows the answer.

59:55.125 --> 59:58.295
Look, I know
Camilla and Tony,
it's been...

59:58.328 --> 01:00:01.298
All of this isn't
freaking you out?

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.668
All of what?

01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:06.170
I really hope this is
some sort of denial.

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:08.839
Because even you can't
possibly be this dense.

01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:10.808
(scoffs) Okay.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.378
Geez.

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:20.117
I saw it too, Rob.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.187
The thing Heather
was talking about
in the car.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.857
I don't know what it was,
but I saw it.

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:28.258
Why didn't you
say anything?

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:31.295
- Why didn't you?
- I was driving.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:34.699
The-the last thing
I remember was glass
flying towards my face.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.736
These aren't exactly
matching tattoos, Rob.

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:43.307
We were in an accident.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.676
And we all got
the exact same bruise?

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:49.613
Stop lying to yourself.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.481
You're just as freaked out
as the rest of us.

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:53.650
Fine.
You know, maybe I am.

01:00:53.684 --> 01:00:57.287
Maybe I'm too terrified
for rational thought.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.489
We should've gone
with Heather and Gabe.

01:00:59.523 --> 01:01:02.459
You were the first one
who said you didn't
want to go.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.561
What the hell
are we supposed
to do about it now?

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:08.365
(cell phone ringing)

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:10.334
- Hey.
- Bethany, it's Heather.

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:12.970
- I need you to listen to me.
- Whoa, Heather, slow down.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.705
Say that again.

01:01:14.739 --> 01:01:17.574
Bethany, where are you?
Is Rob still with you?

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:19.343
Heather, you sound
freaked out.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:21.846
Are you okay?
Should we call the police?

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:24.014
- What's going on?
- Heather: No police.

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:26.250
- Where's Max?
- Probably still at the gym.

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:27.752
- I...
- Bethany, I know
this sounds crazy,

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:29.519
but I need you
to trust me.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:31.722
Get to the school as quick
as you can. Find Max.

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:34.691
Find a room with good lighting
and stay together.

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:36.693
Don't let anyone out of
your sight. Understand?

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:39.096
- Heather, you're scaring me.
- Good.

01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:41.065
Stay together.
We'll be there soon.

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:43.533
- (phone hangs up)
- What was that all about?

01:01:43.567 --> 01:01:44.701
Come on.
I'll explain on the way.

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:50.507
- Max isn't answering.
- Keep trying.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.342
Heather, we can't
do this alone.
We need help.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:55.045
No, this is up to us.
Gabe, we're all marked.

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:57.748
Anyone who sees us gets marked.
We can't bring anyone else in.

01:01:57.782 --> 01:01:59.817
We need to figure out
how to kill this thing.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:05.589
(car starts)

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:12.196
(line ringing)

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:14.064
- Gabe: So, anything?
- Nothing.

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:15.632
He's not answering.

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.868
That old man, that doctor,
he figured it out.

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:20.304
- He what?
- Those lights,
the light set up.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:22.706
We can kill this thing.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.308
The light kills it.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:26.410
So, why didn't it
work for him?

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:29.746
Because he was old and weak and
he was trying to do it alone.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.950
Look, if we stick together,
this thing will come after us.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:34.985
We just have to figure out
how to trap it.

01:02:35.019 --> 01:02:37.321
Great.

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:38.856
Sounds terrible.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:02.446
Maybe we should split up
and look for him.

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.282
Seriously?
Are you high right now?

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:06.884
Come on.

01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:12.056
God, there are you.
Dude, answer your cell phone
next time.

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:16.894
Max?

01:03:27.872 --> 01:03:31.108
- Is this good? Yeah?
- Yeah, it looks good.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.144
Max still isn't answering.
And now Bethany isn't
returning her texts.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.613
She never puts her phone down,
and now she's not answering?

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.183
- (door shuts)
- Typical.

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.218
Come on.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.323
I'm glad Bethany
remembered the part about
leaving the lights on.

01:03:48.092 --> 01:03:50.327
- Man, I hate this plan.
- I know, so do I.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.562
Okay, think.
Where would they be?

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:54.865
- Um, I don't know.
The gym maybe.
- (indistinct conversation)

01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:57.001
Shh.

01:03:57.034 --> 01:03:59.736
The teachers' lounge.
Come on.

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:03.908
Rob: Finally.

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:08.012
Are you guys okay?

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:10.547
Yeah. We've been waiting here
just like you said.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.550
So, you want to tell us
what we're doing here exactly?

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:16.653
Heather:
He doesn't look so good.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.056
Yeah. He was like that
when we found him.

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:26.396
(Max groans)

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:33.503
You were right, Heather.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:36.140
Wow, that is something
I never thought I'd never hear.

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:42.612
- I saw it.
- Heather: I know.

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:46.316
- It's coming after us.
- What are you talking about?

01:04:53.257 --> 01:04:56.560
Heather:
The old man left a tape.
This thing, this demon...

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:57.928
- Old man:
The demon needs a host.
- ...it needs a host.

01:04:57.962 --> 01:04:59.763
Both:
Like a parasite.

01:04:59.796 --> 01:05:03.067
Old man: To travel in daylight,
to stalk its next victim.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.469
But it has a weakness.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:08.638
It can only possess you
when you're alone.

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:10.807
I thought I could
keep my family safe

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.742
by keeping us all together.

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:15.412
But that's when
the nightmare started.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:17.147
Just visions at first.

01:05:17.181 --> 01:05:18.782
Tricks of the mind.

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:21.651
Then the hallucinations
got so strong,

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:24.288
I couldn't even tell
what was real anymore.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:27.958
It uses your worst fears
against you to separate you.

01:05:27.992 --> 01:05:31.261
To lure you into the darkness
where it can strike.

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:33.998
And with every host
it consumes,

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:36.833
it becomes more powerful,
more deceitful.

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:39.303
The key is light.

01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:41.771
You can kill it
with enough light.

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:44.774
I've set a trap,
so when it's my time,

01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:46.410
I'll destroy it.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:49.646
Or, if I fail,
it'll destroy me.

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:53.283
And then... God help us.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.522
We can do this.

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:00.690
We just have to stick together

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:04.061
and stay in the light
and wait it out until morning.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:07.931
So, we're all marked.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.666
It means we're gonna die?

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.136
Unless we figure out
a way to stop it.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:14.371
So, how do we stop it?

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:16.340
With light.

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:20.110
If we get enough light,
maybe we can destroy it.

01:06:20.144 --> 01:06:23.713
- So, it's like a vampire.
- But vampires aren't real, man.

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:26.016
Dude, at this point,
I'm open to anything.

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.686
It's not just sunlight.
Any light can hurt it.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:32.656
If we could just figure out
a way to trap it somehow.

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.991
Yeah, sounds great, but we don't
even know where this thing is.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:37.194
- How are we
supposed to trap it?
- Heather: I'm not sure yet.

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:38.428
- The light--
- It's here.

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:43.767
And it's going to kill you.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:47.371
- (door bangs)
- (gasps)

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:55.045
Did you guys...

01:07:11.895 --> 01:07:14.631
Heather.

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:32.149
- Mom?
- Don't "Mom" me.

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:49.933
- Heather?
- Voice: Shh.

01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:57.107
(children laughing)

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:11.488
(children laughing)

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:12.756
Hello?

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:14.791
(gasps)

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:15.925
What?

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:23.800
(grunting)

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:30.038
Hello?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:40.149
When I said I wanted
to talk to you, it meant
I wanted to talk to you.

01:08:40.184 --> 01:08:43.319
- Mom, I just--
- No wonder your dad
doesn't love you.

01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:44.854
Mom, stop it.

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:49.259
You're the reason
he left us.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.461
Can you blame him?

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:53.897
Mom!

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:07.143
Guys, come on.
Stop messing around.

01:09:09.513 --> 01:09:11.515
(snarling in distance)

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:52.622
Max, is that you?

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:57.894
(low growling)

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:06.736
(growling continues)

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:14.143
Mom!

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:16.580
Mom!

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.591
Shh.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.430
Max, if that's you, dude, I'm
seriously gonna kick your as--

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:39.235
Man: Rob.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:42.772
Rob.

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:56.420
Bethany:
What are you doing?

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:59.456
Please, no. No, no!
Please don't!

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.369
(whimpering)

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.828
This... isn't...

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:41.331
real!

01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:50.073
Rob.

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:54.711
(shouts)

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:01.851
Bethany:
Please don't!

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:06.390
Get away!

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.501
Max?

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:19.536
(Max groaning)

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:31.180
- (screaming)
- Gabe. Gabe!

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:33.517
Gabe!

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:35.719
You were hallucinating.

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:37.521
Are you okay?

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:42.025
Is this--
is this real?

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:44.528
- This is real.
- Ow. Ow, okay.

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:46.896
Ow. Ow.

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.702
Okay, we need to find
the others and warn them.

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:54.904
Yeah, except Max.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:57.807
Yeah. We don't
need to warn him.

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:11.988
There you are.

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:16.960
Bethany?

01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:19.963
Are you okay?

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:32.509
Oh, my God. Beth-- Bethany,
what happened to you?

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:37.213
I... I found Max.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.148
What? Where?

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:43.987
(crying)

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.625
Oh, my God.

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:53.563
Shh. I'm here, I'm here.
I got you, babe, I got you.

01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:55.599
You're gonna be okay.

01:13:57.801 --> 01:13:59.803
You're gonna be okay.

01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:12.448
Bethany? Rob?

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:14.484
Where the hell
are they?

01:14:14.518 --> 01:14:16.520
(Bethany screams)

01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:19.756
Bethany.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.324
It came from that way.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.297
There's no one here.

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:30.333
I can see that.

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:33.703
(door opens)

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:45.815
(low groaning)

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:52.388
Heather:
Okay, just stay together.

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:56.059
- He can't hurt us
if we're together.
- Are you sure?

01:14:56.092 --> 01:14:58.194
- Uh, I think so.
- Rob: (lowered)
I can hurt you.

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:01.230
And I promise,
this will hurt.

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:21.885
Rob:
(lowered) Pathetic.

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.259
(groans)

01:15:31.795 --> 01:15:33.763
Heather: Gabe!

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:38.301
(grunting)

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:56.385
Gabe!

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:44.000
This isn't happening.

01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:47.837
Camilla: Heather.

01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:51.975
How could you have
lied to me like that?

01:16:52.008 --> 01:16:53.910
I...

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.379
Camilla:
I mean, what kind of
bitch friend are you?

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:01.384
Everyone is dead
because of you.

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:05.054
Or soon will be.

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:09.693
You know what, Heather?

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:12.461
You really do deserve to die.

01:17:13.697 --> 01:17:15.531
This is all your fault.

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:18.267
You should've
just told me the truth,

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:20.436
then none of this
would've happened.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.972
No one would've died.

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:25.742
You're right.

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:30.313
And I am sorry.

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.650
But there's just
one little problem.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.688
You're not Camilla.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:02.378
(growling)

01:18:06.783 --> 01:18:08.217
Come on!

01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:33.910
Damn it!

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:38.081
(snarling)

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:45.922
(roars)

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:21.925
Heather.

01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:31.594
(roars)

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:06.896
(shrieking)

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:45.268
Heather! Heather!

01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:47.270
Heather!

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:50.773
Heather.

01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:52.608
Heather!

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:54.410
Heather.

01:22:00.516 --> 01:22:02.952
Are you you?
Like you you?

01:22:02.986 --> 01:22:05.989
- Yeah, it's me.
- Okay.

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:09.058
What-what happened in fourth
grade in Miss Miller's class?

01:22:09.092 --> 01:22:10.759
Really embarrassing.

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:12.928
Are you talking
about the time you
barfed all over her?

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:14.763
That was so gross.

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:21.104
It's... it's over.

01:22:22.305 --> 01:22:24.507
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.443
- Are you?
- I thought I died.

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:29.078
I saw white light.

01:22:29.112 --> 01:22:31.947
That was the flashlight
pointed at your face.

01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:43.959
- Gabe: But seriously, though...
- Yeah?

01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:46.462
I mean this in, like,
the nicest way possible...

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:49.198
- Okay.
- Please don't invite me

01:22:49.232 --> 01:22:51.767
to anymore parties,
like, ever. (chuckles)

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.103
(Heather chuckles)
Deal.

01:22:54.137 --> 01:22:56.139
(both laugh)

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:03.146
(music playing)
