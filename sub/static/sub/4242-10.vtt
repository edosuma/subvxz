WEBVTT

00:00.980 --> 00:02.390
So here is what you miss on Glee.

00:02.425 --> 00:04.000
Sam and Mercedes started secretly dating,

00:04.035 --> 00:05.220
and then he left town and now he's back

00:05.255 --> 00:05.890
and wants her back,

00:05.925 --> 00:07.090
but Mercedes has a new man

00:07.125 --> 00:08.160
I've moved on.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.330
Coach Beiste had the hots for Cooter the football recruiter

00:10.365 --> 00:11.720
and he liked her back but when Sue found out,

00:11.755 --> 00:13.720
she decided she wanted Cooter all to herself.

00:13.755 --> 00:14.860
Emma's got wedding fever,

00:14.895 --> 00:15.640
but Will's a little skittish

00:15.675 --> 00:17.320
'cause the last time he was married, it didn't go well.

00:17.330 --> 00:18.440
Terri pretended to be pregnant,

00:18.475 --> 00:20.010
she yelled a lot, and she hated the Glee Club.

00:20.045 --> 00:22.060
And that's what you missed on Glee.

00:24.130 --> 00:25.770
Mercedes, what's the deal with you and Sam?

00:25.805 --> 00:27.340
You've been stealing glances in the choir room,

00:27.375 --> 00:28.510
and you still haven't told us

00:28.545 --> 00:30.480
what happened over summer vacation.

00:31.980 --> 00:33.740
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:34.810 --> 00:35.850
- Go.
- It's true.

00:35.885 --> 00:39.130
Sam and I spent a lot of time together at the lake.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.520
And... we had a fling.

00:42.555 --> 00:43.610
Hey, tell us everything.

00:43.645 --> 00:44.950
Yeah, dude, give us specifics.

02:58.730 --> 03:00.800
I, Becky Faye Jackson,

03:00.835 --> 03:03.290
am the hottest bitch at McKinley High School.

03:03.325 --> 03:05.870
je ne suis pas seulement co-capitaine

03:05.905 --> 03:08.390
I'm president of the Perfect Attendance Club

03:08.425 --> 03:12.210
and I've won a participation award in rhythm gymnastics.

03:12.245 --> 03:13.100
You may be wondering

03:13.135 --> 03:15.260
why I sound like The Queen of England.

03:15.270 --> 03:16.940
It's simple, in my mind,

03:16.975 --> 03:18.640
I can sound like whomever I want.

03:18.650 --> 03:20.390
So lay off, haters.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.450
Okay, let's get reals.

03:23.460 --> 03:27.270
I could easily snag any dude east of the Mississippi,

03:27.305 --> 03:29.560
but I'm extremely picky.

03:29.570 --> 03:32.400
For instance, Rory grins too much.

03:32.435 --> 03:34.540
He looks like an insane person.

03:34.575 --> 03:36.280
Is that a Mohawk, Puckerman,

03:36.315 --> 03:39.050
or did someone glue a squirrel to your head?

03:39.790 --> 03:40.550
No-Chang-do.

03:40.585 --> 03:42.960
I'm no rice queen.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.900
Now, that's more like it.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.440
Sweet, sexy and handi-capable like me,

03:50.660 --> 03:54.630
with a voice as velvety as my favorite Sunday church dress.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.410
It's decided.

03:56.520 --> 04:00.070
Artie Abrams, you're my new boyfriend.

04:00.105 --> 04:01.340
What happened to Jason,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.400
that cute boy you took to the prom?

04:03.435 --> 04:06.500
I like hot dogs and he likes pizza.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.460
And I like Artie now.

04:08.495 --> 04:10.200
What do I do, Coach?

04:10.300 --> 04:11.650
You can ask him out on a date.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.320
Worst he could say is "No."

04:13.390 --> 04:14.690
True that.

04:15.070 --> 04:17.980
Frankly, Becky, I think you can do better.

04:18.130 --> 04:19.570
Mind if I join you?

04:19.940 --> 04:22.000
Sure, Ems, but your man's over there.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.480
Yeah, I'm just gonna let him be.

04:23.515 --> 04:26.410
He totally tanked his fantasy football season, so...

04:26.960 --> 04:28.830
So, two chickens today, huh?

04:29.020 --> 04:30.600
Emma, I'm celebrating.

04:30.635 --> 04:31.650
Why?

04:31.685 --> 04:33.350
Cooter and I eloped.

04:34.490 --> 04:36.430
- You what?
- How did it happen?

04:36.465 --> 04:37.860
Well, you know, I've tried to be better

04:37.895 --> 04:39.570
- about showing folks my feelings.
- Right.

04:39.605 --> 04:41.710
So there we were, it was Christmas Eve,

04:41.745 --> 04:43.520
and we are at the Taco Bell.

04:43.555 --> 04:46.510
And I looked Cooter right in the eye and I said,

04:46.520 --> 04:48.090
"Coots, I gotta tell ya,

04:48.125 --> 04:49.700
I think you're my soul mate."

04:49.735 --> 04:50.980
And the next thing you know,

04:50.990 --> 04:53.980
I'm walking out of Fort Wayne's 24-Hour Chapel.

04:53.990 --> 04:56.240
- Mrs. Cooter Mankins.
- Oh, my God.

04:56.275 --> 04:58.290
That's why he hasn't called me in weeks.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.060
Well, Michael Chiklis in a wig,

05:00.070 --> 05:02.930
I would like to offer my congratulations.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.430
I've been bested.

05:04.465 --> 05:06.600
I guess it's time to call Boreanaz.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.390
Aw, wh's wrong, Punkin?

05:09.620 --> 05:11.940
Shannon, I'm so, so glad this is happening for you,

05:11.975 --> 05:13.190
I am.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.930
I don't think Will wants to marry me.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.940
For God's sake, Amelia it's 2012.

05:18.975 --> 05:21.770
If you want to marry Will Suester, ask him.

What?

07:16.235 --> 07:17.960
No. No, I didn't.

07:17.970 --> 07:18.860
Was that out loud?

07:18.895 --> 07:20.960
No, I didn't. Oh, my God.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.470
Finn, give me a drum roll!

07:28.080 --> 07:32.140
Marry...me.Marry me. Question mark!

07:32.175 --> 07:34.360
Yes, I am proposing to Ms. Pillsbury.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.190
This is the kind of news that you share with your family,

07:43.225 --> 07:45.110
and you guys are my family.

07:45.145 --> 07:47.740
Mr. Shue, we're so happy for you.

07:47.775 --> 07:50.010
We totally don't think you'll screw it up this time.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.450
Here's the thing: it'sot to be perfect.

07:52.470 --> 07:55.010
I'm sitting down with Emma's parents to ask for permission,

07:55.045 --> 07:59.110
and then this proposal needs to knock her well-washed socks off.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.040
And that's where you guys come in, okay?

08:01.050 --> 08:02.610
So the assignment for the week

08:02.645 --> 08:04.830
is to come up with a proposal number.

08:04.865 --> 08:08.020
And you know Ms. Pillsbury-- it's got to be perfect.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.920
Well, you can count on us, Mr. Shue.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.560
Hey.

08:11.740 --> 08:12.840
Pretty romantic, huh?

08:12.875 --> 08:14.280
Think you're going to get married someday?

08:14.315 --> 08:15.660
After I win my first Grammy.

08:15.695 --> 08:16.980
You have any idea who the guy is going to be?

08:16.990 --> 08:18.650
Cause I know this awesome dude who's great at impressions

08:18.685 --> 08:19.870
and totally into you.

08:19.905 --> 08:21.160
Sam, stop.

08:21.195 --> 08:22.510
I'm with Shane.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.310
It's because I'm white, right?

08:24.345 --> 08:25.830
Are you insane?

08:25.900 --> 08:28.130
Okay, then it's because he's such a stud athlete.

08:28.165 --> 08:30.410
That letterman jacket makes all the girls go wild, I know.

08:30.445 --> 08:32.169
It was a summer fling, Sam.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.559
You telling me

08:33.595 --> 08:35.260
thinking about that tilt-a-whirl at carnival

08:35.270 --> 08:36.760
doesn't make you smile?

08:36.794 --> 08:38.000
Okay, that was fun.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.200
That's what I thought.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.000
But I'm with Shane now.

08:41.630 --> 08:43.750
Sorry, but summer is long over.

08:48.560 --> 08:49.720
Hey, Sugar.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.550
I was wondering if maybe you wanted to work on a number

08:53.585 --> 08:55.050
together for Mr. Shue.

08:55.085 --> 08:57.300
Since I'm a director, I-I thought,

08:57.335 --> 08:58.660
you know, it would be really great...

08:58.670 --> 09:01.090
Look, Artie, you seem really sweet.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.530
You're really just not my type.

09:02.565 --> 09:05.470
No, I wasn't really asking you out, but...

09:05.505 --> 09:07.290
I just think we'd look really weird together.

09:07.325 --> 09:08.580
Not that you're disabled,

09:08.690 --> 09:10.520
it's 'cause I'm abled,

09:10.555 --> 09:12.260
and people are really mean.

09:12.295 --> 09:14.200
I'm really worried that people are gonna think

09:14.235 --> 09:16.310
your legs look thinner than my arms.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.970
Hi, Artie.

09:21.005 --> 09:22.930
Um, do you want to go out?

09:23.850 --> 09:25.210
Go out where?

09:25.280 --> 09:26.800
On a date.

09:33.260 --> 09:35.360
Hey, Coach. I'm not sure if you remember me.

09:35.370 --> 09:37.430
Uh, Sam Evans. I want to join the basketball team.

09:37.465 --> 09:38.370
Are you serious?

09:38.405 --> 09:39.970
Where were you when I was having tryouts?

09:40.005 --> 09:41.880
Uh, living in a hotel in Kentucky.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.490
To be honest, sir, I really want a letterman jacket

09:44.525 --> 09:45.860
with a varsity letter on it to wear this year

09:45.895 --> 09:48.340
and I need it, like, fast.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.590
Look, pal, every team at this school's

09:50.625 --> 09:52.510
already been practicing for months.

09:52.545 --> 09:53.910
The seasons have already started.

09:53.945 --> 09:56.360
Is there any team I can join in any sport? Please?

09:56.395 --> 09:57.140
Anything?

09:57.175 --> 09:59.270
Well, I mean, yeah, there's one,

09:59.305 --> 10:01.320
but I don't think you're gonna be inrested.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.070
Here's your chamois. Guard it with your life.

10:10.105 --> 10:11.720
Every Guppy gets one and only one.

10:11.730 --> 10:13.050
You also get a letterman robe,

10:13.060 --> 10:14.740
so you'll need to pick a nickname to embroider on the back.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.080
It should be water-themed.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.090
I'm Vinny the Gill.

10:17.125 --> 10:17.820
Would Trouty Mouth work?

10:17.855 --> 10:21.080
Sam Evans, I'm Coach Roz Washington,

10:21.115 --> 10:24.220
and you are one strange-looking kid.

10:24.255 --> 10:25.580
I've never seen lips like that

10:25.615 --> 10:26.610
on a white child.

10:26.645 --> 10:28.530
And one of your nipples is higher than the other.

10:28.565 --> 10:30.180
I bet you had overcome a lot

10:30.215 --> 10:31.390
with those crooked nipples.

10:31.425 --> 10:33.330
Well, I know a thing or two about overcoming.

10:33.365 --> 10:34.140
When I was growing up,

10:34.175 --> 10:36.040
they said that black folks couldn't swim.

10:36.075 --> 10:37.700
But I had a dream

10:37.830 --> 10:40.480
that one day, I would get to the promised land!

10:40.515 --> 10:41.650
So I swam my way

10:41.685 --> 10:44.010
and got my 40 acres and a pool.

10:44.045 --> 10:45.250
Coach Roz was an Olympian.

10:45.285 --> 10:46.390
That's right.

10:46.425 --> 10:50.730
I won this bronze damn Olympic medal in Beijing, China

10:50.765 --> 10:53.130
for individual synchronized swimming.

10:53.165 --> 10:54.760
I bet you didn't even know there was such thing as

10:54.770 --> 10:56.560
individual synchronized swimming.

10:56.570 --> 10:58.060
Nod to me if I'm getting through to you!

10:58.095 --> 10:59.680
Nod to me!

10:59.770 --> 11:01.970
I'm gonna say one thing to you, Sam Evans,

11:02.005 --> 11:04.310
and I'm only gonna say it to you once.

11:04.345 --> 11:07.700
If you pee in my pool,

11:07.735 --> 11:10.640
I will kill you.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
Hey, guess what, dude.

11:14.475 --> 11:15.640
I just joined synchronized swimming.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.060
Shh. Keep your voice down.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.100
You want everybody to hear you?

11:18.135 --> 11:19.630
Yeah, it means I get my letterman jacket.

11:19.665 --> 11:21.390
Dude, you're in synchronized swimming and Glee Club.

11:21.425 --> 11:23.080
That's like some kind of weird death wish.

11:23.115 --> 11:24.520
Swimming is sexy.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.280
Not if it's synchronized.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.210
I'm not worried.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.640
Oh, ho, ho, ho. Did you see that?

11:33.650 --> 11:35.170
Synchronized.

11:35.450 --> 11:37.980
Oh, my God, Sam. Are you okay?

11:39.750 --> 11:41.070
What's going on, baby?

11:41.870 --> 11:42.960
I'm just...

11:42.995 --> 11:44.460
I'm helping out a friend.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.700
I think he'll pull through.

11:47.735 --> 11:49.390
Let me walk you to study hall

11:53.900 --> 11:55.130
See you later.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.360
I've been thinking, Mr. Shue.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.490
The girls are gonna try to

12:02.525 --> 12:04.260
neuter you with this proposal assignment by

12:04.295 --> 12:06.560
encouraging you to sing a sappy ballad,

12:06.595 --> 12:07.840
or maybe en cry during it.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.550
That's not only humiliating, it's predictable.

12:09.585 --> 12:12.320
Therefore, I'm proposing you subvert expectations,

12:12.330 --> 12:14.810
- and lead with your hips.
- My what?

12:15.040 --> 12:16.780
So modest. You have rock star hips, Mr. Shue.

12:16.815 --> 12:18.670
It's true. Mick Jagger hip

12:18.705 --> 12:20.690
Yeah. Unleash the moves we've been practicing

12:20.725 --> 12:23.300
on Ms. Pillsbury, and she will swoon.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.090
Don't be alarmed by the disco ball.

I like it. A lot. It's a... it's an inspired choice,

14:39.885 --> 14:41.860
but... you know, all that dancing,

14:41.895 --> 14:43.880
means a lot of sweat, and Emma

14:43.915 --> 14:45.190
hates dirty, so, uh...

14:45.225 --> 14:47.010
you know, I don't want to do anything to trigger her.

14:47.045 --> 14:48.450
It's definitely in the mix.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.170
- I'm gonna go with you, Mr. Shue.
- Yeah.

14:50.205 --> 14:51.720
Wait, please.

14:51.730 --> 14:53.020
Artie, that was awome!

14:53.055 --> 14:54.390
Thanks, Becky. So you had fun?

14:54.425 --> 14:55.970
It was a great Part One.

14:56.005 --> 14:57.130
Part One?

14:57.250 --> 14:58.990
No, that was the date,

14:59.025 --> 14:59.760
the entire date.

14:59.795 --> 15:01.270
I mean, I-I invited you here so you could

15:01.280 --> 15:02.480
see me bring my sexy,

15:02.515 --> 15:04.410
which I think you'll agree I did.

15:04.590 --> 15:07.840
Part Two is dinner at Breadstix.

15:07.850 --> 15:09.110
Oh.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.030
Rachel says you're supposed to spend

15:13.065 --> 15:14.590
two months' salary on the ring.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.540
Or was it two weeks?

15:16.590 --> 15:18.140
Honestly, I just

15:18.210 --> 15:20.430
zone out every time girls start talking about this stuff.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.550
So when's the wedding?

15:22.600 --> 15:24.480
She has to say yes first, right?

15:24.550 --> 15:26.850
And I have to work up the nerve to ask her.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.590
After my last marriage,

15:28.625 --> 15:31.220
I just don't want to fail again.

15:32.100 --> 15:32.910
Finn...

15:33.630 --> 15:35.390
I want you to be my best man.

15:35.425 --> 15:37.610
- Are you screwing with me right now?
- You've taught me more

15:37.690 --> 15:39.740
about being a man than anyone I've ever known.

15:39.830 --> 15:42.410
You stand up for your friends, you're not afraid to cry,

15:42.480 --> 15:44.150
and you'll make sure I don't do anything

15:44.185 --> 15:45.900
too stupid at my bachelor party.

15:47.650 --> 15:48.540
- Is that a "Yes"?
- Yeah.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.400
All right.

15:50.460 --> 15:53.160
Oh, that one's nice.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.520
oh, yeah.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.970
Hey, do you mind if I talk to you about something, man-to-man?

15:59.005 --> 16:01.510
- Yeah.
- I've been thinking about my future, too.

16:02.070 --> 16:04.020
So I met with a recruiter.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.610
I thought you said you were giving up on football.

16:05.670 --> 16:06.360
For the Army.

16:07.940 --> 16:10.340
I just want to do something special, you know.

16:10.390 --> 16:11.530
Like my dad,

16:11.610 --> 16:14.110
but without the whole dying part.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.680
- You know?
- Yeah.

16:18.830 --> 16:19.700
Hey, that one's really nice.

16:19.790 --> 16:23.240
It's medium-sized so it should be easy to clean.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.370
Ms. Pillsbury would really like that.

16:24.460 --> 16:25.910
Yes, she would.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.910
Right this way, please.

16:31.630 --> 16:33.800
In order for us to help you propose to Ms. Pillsbury,

16:33.835 --> 16:35.550
we're going to need some salient information first.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.450
Okay. Come on, ladies. It's not like

16:37.500 --> 16:38.920
this is the first time I've ever proposed.

16:38.970 --> 16:40.790
Oh, yeah? How did that marriage work out for you?

16:40.840 --> 16:42.190
I mean, what was your big move then?

16:42.200 --> 16:43.460
A jumbotron that said

16:43.510 --> 16:45.730
"Hey, Terri, I Want To Make a Fake Baby With You"?

16:45.790 --> 16:48.240
Let's start from the beginning with you and Ms. P

16:48.275 --> 16:50.190
What'd you think the first time you met her?

16:50.670 --> 16:54.750
- Hey, welcome to McKinl, Ms. Pillsbury.
- Thank you.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.890
I'll never forget how I felt the first time I saw her.

That song was so...

20:08.685 --> 20:11.910
It was so beautiful and moving.

20:12.430 --> 20:13.410
The first person

20:13.445 --> 20:15.650
I thought of wasn't Shane.

20:16.610 --> 20:17.890
It was Sam.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.530
I don't know.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.850
I thought it was in the past.

20:22.885 --> 20:25.510
Yeah, I think you just need to take it slow, okay?

20:25.545 --> 20:27.380
And listen to your heart.

20:27.415 --> 20:30.620
Maybe the spark with Sam is still there.

20:32.380 --> 20:33.380
It's the middle of January.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.680
Why is their Christmas tree still up?

20:35.750 --> 20:37.870
Just be grateful Comrade Obama

20:37.905 --> 20:39.470
still allows Christmas.

20:39.550 --> 20:40.970
Okay. Here's your tea.

20:42.270 --> 20:44.890
- Are you sure it decaf chamomile?
- Positive.

20:44.940 --> 20:48.890
I have to say, I'm a little confused.

20:48.940 --> 20:50.980
Yes, where is our little freaky-deaky?

20:51.060 --> 20:53.150
Oh... No, that's not decaf.

20:53.230 --> 20:56.150
Listen, why don't I just cut right to the chase

20:56.230 --> 20:58.240
Uh, I know you guys don't like me very much.

20:58.275 --> 21:00.590
But I want to marry your daughter.

21:00.670 --> 21:04.190
And I know it would mean a lot to her if I got your blessing.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.430
No.

21:07.430 --> 21:08.160
Excuse me?

21:08.195 --> 21:09.500
You asked for my permission.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.730
I'm saying "No."

21:10.765 --> 21:11.740
Are you sure you've really

21:11.775 --> 21:13.180
thought this through?

21:13.215 --> 21:15.520
Our daughter has a very serious problem.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.750
Son, marriage is messy.

21:17.785 --> 21:19.380
And if there's one thing Emma can't handle,

21:19.440 --> 21:20.490
it's a mess.

21:20.550 --> 21:21.470
And that's before babies.

21:21.550 --> 21:22.920
And the diapers and the

21:22.970 --> 21:25.090
sticky hands and the runny noses.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.390
I'm telling you, she will not know how to deal with it.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.090
Are you sure you want that for your kids?

21:29.140 --> 21:30.560
Forget kids.

21:30.610 --> 21:32.600
Is that what you want for yourself?

21:36.540 --> 21:38.540
Hey, Artie, we wanted to talk to you about something.

21:38.590 --> 21:39.870
We think you need a Becky-vention.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.710
You were spotted having dinner with her at Breadstix.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.880
- So?
- So, it's a little weird.

21:44.930 --> 21:46.410
Seriously, dude, what's your angle?

21:46.460 --> 21:47.930
I don't have an angle.

21:48.010 --> 21:50.550
She asked if I wanted to go to Breadstix, and I said, "Yes."

21:50.600 --> 21:52.020
So, tell me about yourself.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.270
What sort of stuff do you like?

21:53.350 --> 21:54.620
What's your favorite movie?

21:54.690 --> 21:55.600
Schindler's List.

21:55.690 --> 21:56.590
Seriously?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.220
Toy Story 3 is a close second.

21:58.270 --> 22:00.060
- What do you want to be when you grow up?
- Five-foot-ten.

22:01.590 --> 22:03.780
You know, Becky, I'm glad we're doing this.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.030
The more I get to know you, the more I like you.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.150
I have to say, you're actually sorta cool.

22:07.230 --> 22:08.900
You should see my dance moves.

22:08.950 --> 22:12.270
My mom says I have "Get Down" Syndrome.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.940
Look, we think it's great that you're being so,

22:13.975 --> 22:15.040
so nice to Becky. But we just...

22:15.110 --> 22:16.470
I don't. I know that girl.

22:16.540 --> 22:17.940
That girl's a sly, conniving bitch.

22:17.990 --> 22:20.290
We just... We think you should be careful.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.690
Yeah, you don't want to lead her on.

22:21.725 --> 22:23.210
I mean, she's gonna think that you want...

22:23.280 --> 22:24.380
What is she going to think, that she's

22:24.450 --> 22:25.580
fun to be around, that I had

22:25.630 --> 22:26.580
a good time hanging out with her.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.950
You guys talk a good game

22:28.000 --> 22:29.790
how it's okay to be different, how it's

22:29.840 --> 22:31.060
what's on the inside that counts,

22:31.120 --> 22:32.290
but I think you're just as narrow-minded

22:32.340 --> 22:33.890
as the rest of this school.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.490
I liked spending time with Becky.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.180
She knows what it'like to be trapped by a disability.

22:37.260 --> 22:38.350
She doesn't care what people think about her.

22:38.430 --> 22:40.010
She's really optimistic about life,

22:40.100 --> 22:41.470
which is really amazing

22:41.520 --> 22:43.400
considering what life has handed her.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.810
But they don't even have that on the keyboard.

22:52.140 --> 22:53.380
Have a seat.

22:55.490 --> 22:56.500
Okay.

22:57.780 --> 22:58.860
Will, uh...

22:58.895 --> 23:01.850
told us about your plans for the future.

23:01.885 --> 23:05.150
Yeah, which was supposed to be private.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.160
Look, I-I knew telling them might upset you,

23:07.240 --> 23:10.160
but I felt obligated to bring Burt and your mom

23:10.240 --> 23:12.440
into this discussion. This is a big decision.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.030
Well, you know, I was... I was going

23:14.110 --> 23:15.300
to tell you guys about it sooner or later.

23:15.335 --> 23:17.370
Look, Finn, you know what Want, okay?

23:17.405 --> 23:19.950
I wanna need somebody to take over the shop

23:19.985 --> 23:22.940
while I'm off in DC, and if I let your brother do it,

23:22.975 --> 23:25.800
he's gonna have all the grey small monkeys wearing white dinner jacket.

23:25.835 --> 23:26.410
Yeah.

23:26.445 --> 23:31.530
Yeah, he would... well I'm not in the scene tomorrow.

23:31.565 --> 23:32.730
Okay, well I'm glad.

23:32.765 --> 23:35.060
Now, because I'm antimilitary or anything like that.

23:35.095 --> 23:37.520
I just don't get where you're coming from with this.

23:37.555 --> 23:39.260
Well, my dad was a war hero.

23:39.295 --> 23:41.150
I have an obligation to him to...

23:41.185 --> 23:42.940
to be a good man.

23:42.975 --> 23:44.310
To make something of myself,

23:44.345 --> 23:45.580
...to help people like he did.

23:45.615 --> 23:47.370
I knew it was about him.

23:47.450 --> 23:50.000
You don't have to prove to anyone that your dads in you.

23:50.090 --> 23:52.340
You know, everybody already knows what kind of man you are.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.630
Yeah, but how can really know until you get tested?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.430
And what better way than...

23:56.500 --> 23:58.380
than to walk in his footsteps?

24:02.230 --> 24:03.890
Your dad was a good man.

24:03.970 --> 24:07.860
was brave and true, and...

24:08.430 --> 24:10.510
he had the same goofy sense of humor you do.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.750
But he didn't die in Iraq.

24:13.810 --> 24:16.280
He served over there, but something happened to him.

24:16.350 --> 24:17.320
I never found out what.

24:17.370 --> 24:19.870
Uh, I... he...

24:19.950 --> 24:22.200
I don't know if he...
he did something or saw something

24:22.290 --> 24:23.910
just lost his way, but...

24:23.960 --> 24:25.240
but he broke.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.160
He died a hero's death, right?

24:28.230 --> 24:29.940
He died in Cincinnati

24:30.010 --> 24:31.800
after being dishonorably discharged.

24:31.860 --> 24:34.370
Honey, he had a drug problem

24:34.420 --> 24:36.470
that he tried to get over when he came home--

24:36.540 --> 24:38.750
for... for you mostly

24:38.840 --> 24:42.370
but... but then he... he would just...

24:42.420 --> 24:46.480
disappear for a day or a week sometimes.

24:46.550 --> 24:49.380
One day, he just didn't come back.

24:49.430 --> 24:51.730
It was an overdose.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.080
Oh, I feel sick.

24:53.150 --> 24:55.270
It's a lot to hear.

24:55.350 --> 24:57.720
Just, uh, you know, take it slow.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.740
Oh, my God.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.860
I see everything that was good in him...

25:02.910 --> 25:04.450
I see it all in you.

25:04.530 --> 25:05.750
Why did you lie to me?

25:05.830 --> 25:07.280
Why?

25:07.370 --> 25:09.270
Because your dad was so much more

25:09.340 --> 25:11.700
than the last few months of his life.

25:11.750 --> 25:14.910
That man he became was not your father.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.760
Honey, I was going to tell you when I thought you were ready.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.740
Well, I'm not ready. I mean, how...

25:19.800 --> 25:21.180
how, how did you think I could ever

25:21.250 --> 25:23.780
be ready for something like that?

25:29.900 --> 25:32.250
Here am I, becky Faye Jackson,

25:32.285 --> 25:34.530
about to seal the deal.

25:35.490 --> 25:36.490
Booya!

25:36.525 --> 25:38.790
At this year's Special Olympics Ball,

25:38.825 --> 25:40.790
I'll have a medal around my neck

25:40.825 --> 25:43.520
and some man candy on my arm.

25:43.555 --> 25:45.230
I absolutely rock.

25:46.450 --> 25:47.300
Hey, Becky what's up?

25:47.335 --> 25:48.650
Hey, hottie.

25:48.685 --> 25:51.000
My place. We're going to do it.

25:51.035 --> 25:53.330
- I'm sorry?
- I just sent you

25:53.365 --> 25:56.970
a taste of what you're going to get on Friday night.

26:03.550 --> 26:05.550
Oh my...

26:05.630 --> 26:07.840
She got a cute little shape.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.990
Coach, you have to help me. I'm freaking out.

26:10.025 --> 26:11.320
Well, you dated Brittany.

26:11.355 --> 26:13.460
I'm sure she sent you titillating photos.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.040
- That freak you out?
- I guess not, but that was different.

26:16.130 --> 26:17.880
Well, did you go out to dinner with Becky?

26:17.960 --> 26:19.330
Yeah. We had a great time.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.050
Do you want to go out with her again?

26:23.740 --> 26:24.830
No.

26:25.870 --> 26:27.370
Well, here's a radical idea.

26:27.420 --> 26:30.560
Why don't you treat her like a real person and tell her?

26:30.640 --> 26:33.260
Becky just wanna be treated like everybody else.

26:33.140 --> 26:36.090
You of all people shloud know that.
So why don't you tell her the truth,

26:36.400 --> 26:38.310
so she can move on and maybe date someone

26:38.380 --> 26:39.430
who doesn't sound

26:39.520 --> 26:40.770
like one of those weird puppets

26:40.850 --> 26:42.350
they bring around to the grade schools

26:42.400 --> 26:43.900
to teach kids about sexual predators?

26:43.990 --> 26:45.490
And for God's sake, can you maybe

26:45.560 --> 26:47.390
go one day without the driving gloves?

26:47.440 --> 26:49.490
It's a wheelchair, Artie, not a Porsche.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.060
Are you finished?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.060
Stop buttoning your shirts up all the way

26:53.110 --> 26:54.660
like a demented 90-year-old.

26:54.700 --> 26:55.730
You look like you're auditioning

26:55.780 --> 26:57.170
for the lead in your nursing home's

26:57.230 --> 26:58.780
stage production of awakenings.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.290
Thanks, Coach

27:12.470 --> 27:15.620
Hi. Almost done.

27:15.690 --> 27:19.440
You started taking down the tree on New Year's Day.

27:21.110 --> 27:22.770
Have a seat.

27:22.860 --> 27:24.230
I want to ask you something.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.450
Uh, not there. Could you...

27:27.530 --> 27:29.700
sit there, please?

27:29.770 --> 27:32.530
Thank you.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.120
Okay.

27:37.910 --> 27:43.160
You know how we're always talking about moving towards marriage,

27:43.250 --> 27:45.410
then nothing really ever happens?

27:45.470 --> 27:48.000
Well, mean, Sue said that I should be all liberated

27:48.080 --> 27:49.500
and ask you to marry me, but...

27:53.290 --> 27:55.890
Do you want to be with me?

27:55.960 --> 27:58.260
I mean, as your wife.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.300
Of course I do.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.550
But?

28:08.570 --> 28:10.770
I love you, you know that.

28:13.030 --> 28:14.890
But what if we get married?

28:14.960 --> 28:19.280
What happens when we have a house, a baby?

28:19.320 --> 28:21.700
How are you going to handle

28:21.735 --> 28:23.950
spit up on your special wednesday sweater.

28:23.985 --> 28:28.660
Sweet heart,you can't control another person.

28:28.710 --> 28:31.160
What if it's all just too much?

28:33.050 --> 28:36.600
I... I mean, I've been taking my medication.

28:36.670 --> 28:39.600
Some days great

28:39.670 --> 28:41.020
Some days...

28:41.100 --> 28:42.470
some days not so great.

28:42.520 --> 28:47.060
I'm... I'm doing the best...
I can...

28:47.550 --> 28:48.580
I'm doing everything that I can.

28:48.615 --> 28:49.950
I know... I know you are, I know you are,

28:49.985 --> 28:52.580
and it's not you fault that you have this...disease,

28:52.615 --> 28:56.700
sometimes, it just so hopeless.

28:59.990 --> 29:01.590
Wow. Okay.

29:07.940 --> 29:10.700
Can I promise you that I'm going to get better?

29:10.735 --> 29:13.080
You know.

29:13.115 --> 29:16.570
This is what you get, you know?

29:16.605 --> 29:19.140
This-this... this incomplete person.

29:19.175 --> 29:23.160
With... with toothbrushes and with rubber gloves

29:23.195 --> 29:25.810
and... and with so much love for you.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.200
But if that's not what you want,

29:34.550 --> 29:37.360
then...then you need to be honest with me.

29:39.230 --> 29:40.730
And with yourself.

29:43.570 --> 29:45.200
And the sooner, the better.

30:00.270 --> 30:02.380
No wonder none of my dreams ever work out.

30:02.415 --> 30:04.090
'Cause I got loser DNA.

30:04.125 --> 30:06.110
Well, if you're throwing a pity party, I want in.

30:06.145 --> 30:07.620
I have as much chance getting

30:07.655 --> 30:10.010
into NYADA as I do playing Stanley in Streetcar.

30:10.045 --> 30:11.010
Yeah, well, the letters came out

30:11.045 --> 30:12.790
from NYADA today saying who are finalists,

30:12.825 --> 30:14.490
and I have been trolling the NYADA chat rooms,

30:14.525 --> 30:17.130
and people are already talking about getting those letters.

30:17.165 --> 30:18.860
- You didn't get one?
- No, and I'm not going to,

30:18.895 --> 30:21.160
because Figgins put an addendum to my application

30:21.195 --> 30:23.210
talking about my suspension.

30:25.810 --> 30:27.680
Screw this. I'm getting a whole cheesecake.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.500
The future used to be such an abstract idea.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.340
Uh, and the dream was enough, you know?

30:35.590 --> 30:38.540
But now the future has the nerve to show up,

30:38.575 --> 30:40.530
and it's expecting us to do something,

30:40.565 --> 30:44.080
and it's not interested in giving a lending hand.

30:44.115 --> 30:45.130
I'm actually kind of scared.

30:45.165 --> 30:47.360
I thought the world would care more.

30:47.395 --> 30:48.580
Make that two cheesecakes.

30:48.990 --> 30:52.390
I actually thought we were all going to get out of here. You know?

30:52.460 --> 30:55.170
Why did she have to tell me that?

30:55.205 --> 30:56.740
And why can't I have something in my life

30:56.775 --> 31:01.210

You know, I just wanted to say that I thought that

33:42.545 --> 33:44.560
you blew that song out of the water

33:44.595 --> 33:46.390
and totally nailed the assignment.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.370
Oh, no, wait, wait a second.

33:48.405 --> 33:49.840
Was-- the assignment wasn't

33:49.875 --> 33:51.360
"Make everything about Rachel Berry

33:51.395 --> 33:53.050

33:53.085 --> 33:55.120
Easy, Santana.

33:55.155 --> 33:55.980
It's fine.

33:56.015 --> 33:57.010
That was beautiful, Rachel.

33:57.045 --> 33:58.320
So, Mr. Shue, what do you think?

33:58.355 --> 34:00.210
We've given you a whole bevy of songs to choose from,

34:00.245 --> 34:02.520

34:02.555 --> 34:05.520
to a little overwrought for my taste.

34:05.555 --> 34:07.690
They've all been incredible, you guys.

34:07.725 --> 34:11.090
I think I just need a little more time to

34:11.125 --> 34:12.219
really consider my choices.

34:25.010 --> 34:25.830
Mr. Shue?

34:25.864 --> 34:28.080
Um, I probably should've said this the other day in Glee Club,

34:28.114 --> 34:29.780
but you know that whole proposal thing?

34:29.815 --> 34:31.030
How you want it to be big and special

34:31.065 --> 34:32.250
and worthy of Ms. Pillsbury?

34:33.340 --> 34:34.360

Emma...

37:42.640 --> 37:44.920
...you are the one.

37:44.955 --> 37:46.400
You always have been.

37:47.260 --> 37:48.970
The truth is, I feel like I've had to stop myself

37:49.005 --> 37:51.210
from doing this from the second I first saw you.

37:52.810 --> 37:54.180
The first time I held this hand,

37:54.930 --> 37:57.510
it felt like I'd held it a million times before.

37:57.545 --> 37:58.550
Like somehow,

37:59.300 --> 38:00.750
it's always been here.

38:01.850 --> 38:04.150
Life is messy.

38:04.185 --> 38:05.440
It just is.

38:06.040 --> 38:08.110
And I... I know that's hard for you,

38:08.145 --> 38:11.570
but that's why you have me-- to balance things out.

38:11.605 --> 38:15.680
But you have to realize, you do that for me, too.

38:15.715 --> 38:16.780
Every day.

38:18.250 --> 38:20.920
Loving you and being loved by you

38:20.955 --> 38:22.930
makes everything better.

38:24.580 --> 38:26.420
I love you with everything I am

38:26.455 --> 38:28.290
and everything I ever hope to be.

38:28.920 --> 38:29.760
So...

38:31.940 --> 38:33.470
Oh... Emma Pillsbury...

38:37.120 --> 38:40.890
Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?

38:43.100 --> 38:44.960
I love you so much.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.870
Is that a yes?

38:48.560 --> 38:52.050
Yes. Yes.

38:52.085 --> 38:53.850
Yes.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.780
Hi, Becky.

39:04.150 --> 39:05.250
About Friday night...

39:05.285 --> 39:06.570
Are you excited?

39:08.320 --> 39:09.500
Look...

39:09.990 --> 39:11.500
I haven't been clear with you.

39:11.535 --> 39:13.020
I really like being your friend,

39:13.055 --> 39:15.720
but I don't think we should date.

39:17.690 --> 39:20.240
Is it because I'm too intimidating?

39:21.120 --> 39:22.640
Yeah.

39:23.430 --> 39:24.550
I get it.

39:24.585 --> 39:26.190
See you later.

39:30.740 --> 39:32.990
I didn't ask him what I wanted to ask him.

39:33.025 --> 39:36.170
I didn't ask if the reason he didn't want to be my boyfriend

39:36.205 --> 39:37.970
was because I have Down's.

39:38.005 --> 39:40.740
I didn't ask him because I know the answer is yes.

39:40.775 --> 39:43.620
Some days, it sucks being me.

39:43.655 --> 39:45.800
This is one of those days.

39:46.570 --> 39:47.810
Focus, Becky.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.310
Don't let them see you cry.

39:50.810 --> 39:53.070
Becky, you'll come to learn there's

39:53.105 --> 39:55.560
nothing quite like a good sob.

39:55.595 --> 39:57.810
It hurts, Coach.

39:57.845 --> 39:59.310
I liked him.

39:59.345 --> 40:01.780
I know. I know.

40:01.815 --> 40:05.090
Well, you'll be happy to know you and I are in the same boat.

40:05.125 --> 40:06.670
We both got dumped.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.000
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

40:10.460 --> 40:11.810
Gonna get some ice cream.

40:12.630 --> 40:13.940
Couple spoons.

40:13.975 --> 40:18.570
We're gonna turn our chairs towards the television,

40:19.790 --> 40:24.400
and we're gonna watch some Lifetime television for ovaries

40:24.435 --> 40:27.260
and wait for Beaches to come on.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.830
You know what the third thing is?

40:29.910 --> 40:31.030
What?

40:31.630 --> 40:33.930
You're gonna take my hand...

40:36.370 --> 40:39.940
...because you and I are going to get through this together.

40:40.590 --> 40:41.840
Okay.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.490
You have his eyes.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.580
His mouth a little bit, too.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.500
I've always had trouble finding myself in his face.

40:54.535 --> 40:55.760
You know, I...

40:55.795 --> 40:58.110
when I was kid, I used to stare up at the wall,

40:58.145 --> 40:59.060
his picture hanging there,

40:59.095 --> 41:03.000
and I used to convince myself we were, like, twins.

41:04.620 --> 41:05.850
Is that why you asked me to meet you here?

41:05.885 --> 41:07.330
To talk about your dad?

41:09.150 --> 41:10.120
No, no.

41:10.155 --> 41:12.960
I, uh, I want to talk about you.

41:12.995 --> 41:14.570
About us.

41:16.270 --> 41:18.330
I was gonna lay out a picnic,

41:18.365 --> 41:20.650
like the one you had for our first date,

41:20.685 --> 41:22.390
but I couldn't really figure out where you got

41:22.425 --> 41:24.030
those cool airplane cups, so...

41:24.065 --> 41:26.630
And I told you you could kiss me if you wanted to.

41:26.665 --> 41:29.220
I never understood why you ran off so quickly.

41:29.950 --> 41:32.140
Yeah, I was just nervous.

41:32.175 --> 41:34.570
Oh, I could never make you nervous.

41:35.650 --> 41:36.880
Kind of nervous right now.

41:36.915 --> 41:38.110
Wait, what's going on?

41:38.145 --> 41:41.920
Look, uh, I have something to talk to you about,

41:41.955 --> 41:43.680
but I want you to promise me

41:43.715 --> 41:45.700
that you won't say a word until I'm done.

41:45.735 --> 41:47.890
Okay, and I know that's sort of hard for you,

41:47.925 --> 41:49.390
so I need you to promise me.

41:50.630 --> 41:52.160
Okay, I promise.

41:56.210 --> 41:56.810
Um, I just feel like,

41:56.845 --> 41:59.680
all my life, I've been, you know, wondering

41:59.715 --> 42:02.370
if I was gonna be as much of a man as my father was.

42:02.405 --> 42:04.830
Now, all of a sudden, I'm up at night worried

42:06.170 --> 42:09.130
that I'm gonna become the man who he was.

42:09.165 --> 42:12.320
Let's face it, I got, I got

42:12.355 --> 42:14.180
"High school hero, life zero" written all over me.

42:14.215 --> 42:18.660
Except for one thing: you.

42:18.695 --> 42:23.430
You're like a beacon of light guiding me through the darkness.

42:23.465 --> 42:25.100
You're like this big gold star,

42:25.135 --> 42:29.930
and for some bizarre reason, you chose to let me love you.

42:29.965 --> 42:33.990
And... I feel like if I can just convince you

42:34.025 --> 42:39.250
to let me keep doing that, I'm going to be okay.

42:40.130 --> 42:42.070
Everything's going to be okay.

42:46.580 --> 42:48.920
I opened up my first c-credit card to get this.

42:48.955 --> 42:53.470
I know it's not a swimming pool full of dancers

42:53.505 --> 42:56.930
or a tux or-- it's not very big,

42:56.965 --> 42:59.190
but it's a promise--

42:59.225 --> 43:03.220
promise to keep loving you for the rest of my life.

43:04.170 --> 43:05.740
All you've got to do is say yes.

43:07.230 --> 43:08.720
Rachel Berry...

43:11.310 --> 43:13.180
will you marry me?
