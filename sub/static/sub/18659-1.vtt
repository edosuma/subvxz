01:21.080 --> 01:23.913
I hope you have a very good
reason for calling me out here.

01:25.040 --> 01:28.237
About an hour ago two workmen
digging the foundations for

01:28.400 --> 01:31.551
the IT Center found four
bodies in a very advanced

01:32.160 --> 01:34.674
state of decomposition...
It seems that the site the

01:34.840 --> 01:37.832
workmen were digging at
was an old Turkish graveyard.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.915
Those skeletons are three
hundred years old. Apparently

01:41.080 --> 01:43.469
they died from the plague.
That's why they're covered

01:43.680 --> 01:47.639
in lime. But that's not
the interesting part...

01:47.880 --> 01:51.270
The bodies are not sufficiently
Decomposed for their age.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.513
Let me show you...

01:54.960 --> 01:58.999
One of the men cut himself
on the skeleton's ribs.

02:00.280 --> 02:03.033
An ordinary cut,
or so it seemed...

02:04.960 --> 02:08.032
But then, by the time
the medical staff arrived

02:08.160 --> 02:09.309
he was already dead.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.229
From the plague!?

02:11.440 --> 02:12.475
We still don't know.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.270
I want all the skeletons
vacuum-sealed, as well as

02:31.440 --> 02:34.910
this body here. I'll inform you
later about where to send them.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.991
And keep quiet on this.
Not a word.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.313
So you weren't sent
to the exercise?

03:43.080 --> 03:45.992
I guess they had to leave
someone in the city, grandpa.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.356
I ain't your gandpa, sonny.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.949
C'mon gandpa, relax.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.996
They called from the
Chemistry department,

03:54.160 --> 03:55.673
they'll be here
in a couple of minutes...

03:56.200 --> 03:57.189
Can't wait...

03:58.440 --> 04:01.273
Umm excuse me,
can I just ask you...

04:01.440 --> 04:05.399
The train from Romania...
it's running late, isn't it?

04:06.040 --> 04:08.076
It just passed through...
You didn't see?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.716
What do you mean...
passed through?

04:12.240 --> 04:14.151
The trains are not
stopping today...

04:14.480 --> 04:17.119
You know - this big
military exercise, and-

04:17.320 --> 04:19.117
You didn't see the sign
at the entrance?

04:19.880 --> 04:21.279
I have to make a phonecall...

04:21.560 --> 04:23.835
Cell phones aren't working...
because of this military

04:24.000 --> 04:28.198
exercise. Come this way...
I'll let you use a phone.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.998
Watch out... The tanker's
on it's way.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.111
The station's closed and...

04:51.760 --> 04:53.113
Here... use this phone...

04:54.160 --> 04:55.275
The exercises our army is
carrying out in cooperation

04:55.480 --> 04:57.789
with the NATO forces during
this night are planned to

04:57.960 --> 04:59.632
Dial nine first.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.551
continue into the morning,
with a demonstration of

05:02.760 --> 05:04.512
techniques for release of
hostages from the hands

05:04.720 --> 05:05.755
of terrorist groups

05:05.960 --> 05:10.954
Hey, fellas, it's ilegal
to cross the tracks,

05:12.320 --> 05:16.108
it's dangerous...
Where you headed?

05:18.560 --> 05:20.278
No worries, bro...
This stupid exercise

05:20.440 --> 05:23.955
took so long, we figured...
Why wait for morning when we

05:24.120 --> 05:26.350
can have a little fun
before the MP finds us...

05:27.200 --> 05:29.111
An' we wanted to... show
our... American friend how

05:29.240 --> 05:31.470
we party here in Serbia...

05:39.960 --> 05:42.076
Here comes the spook...

05:50.000 --> 05:51.194
Agent Milius.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.518
That's him?

05:56.120 --> 05:58.509
Prisoner 611...
That's your man.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.356
Why is he in a
solitary confinement?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.437
Has he caused any problems?

06:03.920 --> 06:05.114
That's the way it is.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.399
Well get him ready.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.389
You're leaving!

06:17.720 --> 06:19.199
I hear you.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.194
I said you're leaving!

06:29.120 --> 06:30.473
I said - I can hear you!

06:44.760 --> 06:45.875
Don't move!

06:54.440 --> 06:56.556
So they've sent such
sweet things to get me?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.234
You're not gonna shoot me...

07:01.720 --> 07:06.316
There are enforced police
troops outside this building.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.958
Do you really think
you can run away?

07:10.360 --> 07:12.112
It was just my way
to say thanks...

07:14.560 --> 07:15.959
for their hospitality.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.630
Still nothing?

07:41.960 --> 07:44.110
I have to call my wife,
She's gonna wait the whole

07:44.240 --> 07:46.549
night at the station,
and I won't turn up..

07:46.880 --> 07:48.199
She'll call the police...

07:48.760 --> 07:51.752
Women... they always
assume the worst...

07:59.880 --> 08:01.677
Cmon fellas, move along!

08:01.920 --> 08:04.798
Don't you "move along" to me,
You know which unit I am in?

08:05.240 --> 08:07.390
And this is an
American citizen here!

08:08.040 --> 08:11.112
I always shit my pants when
I see you, scientist people.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.116
What's this?
Where's the security?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.391
Don't you go complaining to me...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.230
You want to spend the
night at the station...

08:22.480 --> 08:24.232
Yo, don't you threaten me,
you know who I am?

08:24.400 --> 08:25.515
Do you know who I am?

08:25.760 --> 08:26.954
Whoa, easy...

08:27.480 --> 08:30.040
Wassa matter, chicken?
Where's your courage now?

08:30.200 --> 08:31.952
Stop joking!
give the gun back!

08:32.120 --> 08:33.394
That's loaded!

09:03.200 --> 09:04.189
Masks!

09:38.760 --> 09:40.478
Help! Somebody help me!

09:42.240 --> 09:43.434
Help!

09:59.960 --> 10:01.552
The GPS is definitely not working.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.718
That's because of
military exercises...

10:03.960 --> 10:04.710
Probably...

10:12.960 --> 10:14.075
We should probably...

10:14.600 --> 10:17.797
Since the GPS is down,
just use this map.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.317
You ok?

10:22.320 --> 10:22.877
Yes.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.952
So... We're here...
in Vrsac...

10:28.800 --> 10:31.473
We just take this road
That leads through Pancevo

10:31.680 --> 10:32.669
right into Belgrade.

10:52.800 --> 10:53.710
Concentrate...

10:54.560 --> 10:55.436
They're late...

10:56.360 --> 10:57.679
Agent Reyes is never late...

10:58.040 --> 10:58.790
Reyes!?

10:59.240 --> 11:00.753
I thought we were going
to be accompanied by some

11:00.880 --> 11:01.790
local cop...

11:01.960 --> 11:02.836
No. Mortimer Reyes.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.309
Upon direct request
from Headquarters.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.998
You don't know who he is?

11:08.720 --> 11:10.358
He's a living legend...

11:11.560 --> 11:13.869
He's from Texas. Ex-CIA.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.871
Crossed over into Interpol
twenty years ago, when he

11:17.040 --> 11:19.190
married and took
residence in Serbia.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.555
I brought you breakfast.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.149
You mean dinner.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.879
No, I mean sarma.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.958
Everything is packed. We'll
have to eat out of that.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.668
We have almost five minutes
to eat everything... Dig in.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.038
When does the van
come for the stuff?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.194
In the morning.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.111
The Interpol asked
for the two us,Morty...

12:40.200 --> 12:43.317
Yes... One more case
before I retire...

12:44.480 --> 12:46.914
and it all finishes
before twelve noon...

12:47.800 --> 12:50.553
I can't be late, I wanna
get out of here on time.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.116
You've pulled this thing
All together perfectly?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.511
Yes, of course...
All planned...

12:58.760 --> 13:02.116
The shrink down at the station
calls me a Control Freak.

13:10.960 --> 13:17.433
Dra, so many... years...
So many... memories...

13:19.800 --> 13:21.995
I'm sorry that
you're leaving...

13:23.600 --> 13:25.556
Everything here
reminds me of her.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.953
I know. I understand.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.556
We've been through so
much together...

13:35.200 --> 13:38.158
Now it's time
to say goodbye...

13:43.880 --> 13:45.108
Somebody,pick up
the phone...

14:03.680 --> 14:04.999
The poison's gone...

14:25.280 --> 14:28.397
I was very worried
about you. You know,

14:28.560 --> 14:31.996
everybody outside is
colapsed. The phone lines

14:32.160 --> 14:35.118
are still down,I can't
get the ambulance,

14:35.240 --> 14:36.992
I can't get the police...

15:15.920 --> 15:17.717
I don't get you, Jan...

15:17.920 --> 15:20.559
You're being paid by CNN
to cover a story about

15:20.760 --> 15:22.796
the most polluted
city in Europe...

15:23.040 --> 15:25.235
And instead of that
you're getting drunk

15:25.400 --> 15:26.549
at this party...

15:26.800 --> 15:30.236
I sobered right up when
I saw smoke from the balcony

15:30.400 --> 15:32.436
It was coming
from the station.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.876
Let's go, handsome.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.115
Hey, where are you goin'?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.111
I'm taking Jan
to the station.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.673
I'll be back soon.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.319
Can I come with
you, please?

15:54.840 --> 15:55.795
Pleeeease...

15:56.520 --> 15:58.829
this place just
really... sucks.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.993
Alright, just...
don't talk too much.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.317
Sure.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.199
What are you doing outside?

16:33.720 --> 16:35.312
You know you shouldn't
leave... your cell

16:35.960 --> 16:37.916
until the demons
inside you leave.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.514
The door was open.
There was noone.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.389
You'd better go back.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.512
I've been attacked
by a man...

16:52.680 --> 16:55.956
Sister, is this the DAY?

16:58.400 --> 16:59.992
Blessed is he who
readeth and heareth

17:00.160 --> 17:03.152
the words of this prophecy
and keepeth those things

17:03.320 --> 17:05.196
which are written in it.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.310
For the time is at hand.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.675
For the great day of
their wrath is come.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.191
And who shall be
able to stand?

18:01.920 --> 18:02.909
You're late.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.711
No, you're early.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.709
Your name?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.035
Petrovic, Sir.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.799
Petrovic?
All right, Petrovic...

18:16.480 --> 18:20.029
We're on time,
aren't we?

18:20.840 --> 18:22.068
Of course, Sir.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.834
That's what I thought.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.276
Mina Millius. It's
really nice to meet you.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.271
I've read your file...
It's incredible...

18:31.720 --> 18:33.119
I'm impressed.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.994
But the most interesting
parts aren't in the file.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.117
This is Inspector Belic.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.389
Inspector Belic...

18:39.560 --> 18:41.118
Call me Dragan.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.389
Dragon?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.474
No, just Dragan.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.917
This assignment is simple.
all we have to do is escort

18:52.080 --> 18:55.197
the prisoner to Belgrade;
from there we'll transport

18:55.360 --> 18:57.032
him by plane to London.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.276
I know. I've been checking
the route whole day, but

18:59.440 --> 19:00.839
the GPS hasn't
been working...

19:01.000 --> 19:02.956
We expected that, didn't we?
Everything is fine.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.913
If there ever was an easy
assignment this is it.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.550
We'll be done in
a couple of hours.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.113
Of course, sir...

19:10.360 --> 19:15.753
Relax.This is your operation,
we're here only as supervisors.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.951
That's what makes me nervous.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.557
You've met agent Petrovic.

19:22.760 --> 19:23.909
Yes, I met Petrovic.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.115
Agent Bottin.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.714
Agent Savini is in the van.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.389
All right.
Mina, come..

19:34.040 --> 19:35.155
You'll be fine.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.712
All right, let's go.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.391
Mister President, I was
looking for you in your office.

21:04.960 --> 21:13.356
I'm here. These place.
Brings me peace, relaxes me.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.993
Everything is running according
to plan. Colonel Ironside stated

21:19.160 --> 21:24.075
that, I quote:"in the first two
days of the military maneuvres,

21:24.200 --> 21:29.957
the Serbian Army has demonstrated
capacities and capabilities equal

21:30.120 --> 21:33.351
to those of modern
military powers worldwide."

21:34.000 --> 21:35.194
That's good.

21:35.480 --> 21:41.112
I'm expecting a visit.
The Chief of Bureau.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.437
Really? At this hour?

21:44.600 --> 21:48.479
I haven't received anything
from Protocol, and-

21:48.680 --> 21:51.956
Informal conversation.
An honest chat between

21:52.120 --> 21:56.113
old acquaintances.I suppose
that such conversations.

21:56.240 --> 22:00.677
aren't bound by constraints
of time, or place...

22:16.480 --> 22:19.199
So, first time in the field?

22:21.480 --> 22:23.311
It shows that much, huh?

22:23.520 --> 22:26.318
Not quite.
I read your file too.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.993
You come highly
recommended by the Academy.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.958
With a lap-top in my hands
I'm unstoppable.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.038
But with a gun... we'll see.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.035
Mina... You wanna to
know something,

22:40.600 --> 22:43.239
I've been on this job
for over 20 years.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.990
In all that time,
I've only had to take my

22:47.160 --> 22:50.709
gun out of the holster
twice. Just twice.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.550
And both of those times on
assignments with me...

22:56.400 --> 22:59.119
I'm your jinx, Mortimer...

23:01.080 --> 23:05.835
Dre, if you say third time's
the charm, you will have eaten

23:06.000 --> 23:08.434
your last bowl of sarma!

23:15.720 --> 23:17.073
Who's the prisoner?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.794
And why are we moving him
in the dead of night?

23:19.960 --> 23:22.155
Actually, the file
is very unclear.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.835
Agent Reyes, you know anything
more about the prisoner?

23:26.160 --> 23:30.039
That data is strictly
classified.Your task is

23:30.160 --> 23:32.515
merely to get him to
London, alive and well,

23:32.720 --> 23:35.314
and we're here to help you.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.710
Petrovic? You've been quiet
since we started off?

23:40.880 --> 23:44.270
Maybe I just don't like
the fact that the mission

23:44.440 --> 23:47.000
is being run by a
green rookie!

24:04.080 --> 24:05.308
Are we there?

24:06.080 --> 24:08.913
We're not there...
it just choked.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.832
Stupid YUGO!

24:14.560 --> 24:16.471
We don't have gas, or what?

24:16.880 --> 24:20.156
No... I don't know.
It's just dead.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.792
What happend?

24:29.160 --> 24:31.720
These guys left the party also...

24:42.840 --> 24:44.068
Jan...

24:46.560 --> 24:47.913
Finally!

24:49.400 --> 24:52.870
How far is that station?
Can we walk there?

24:53.480 --> 24:54.959
Jan... look...

25:04.520 --> 25:05.714
Save me!

25:05.880 --> 25:07.199
Jesus saves!

25:07.520 --> 25:09.988
Run! They've gone mad!

25:10.160 --> 25:11.991
Everyone thought I was mad...

25:12.680 --> 25:17.231
I wasn't allowed to leave
the cell but now... Now!

25:18.360 --> 25:19.395
We have to run.

25:24.920 --> 25:25.909
Run!?

25:26.920 --> 25:29.798
This is how end of days
begins, this is the

25:29.960 --> 25:33.794
beginning of Armageddon!

25:39.800 --> 25:43.952
Cut off the serpent's head
And the body will die.

25:48.080 --> 25:53.996
Save me! Get me out of here.
Please, take me with you.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.713
Start the car,
start the car!

25:56.880 --> 25:57.869
Come on!

25:58.560 --> 25:59.310
The key.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.389
Everybody out!

26:03.160 --> 26:04.388
You! Stay away.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.918
I'm not one of them.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.118
This is a nightmare.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.872
I shouldn't take those
mushrooms in the kitchen.

26:51.680 --> 26:54.433
Mr. President, The Chief
of Bureau is here.

27:03.920 --> 27:07.435
I thought that at this time
of night you'd be sleeping.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.632
I didn't think you'd
respond to my call tonight.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.513
Really? How could I refuse?

27:15.600 --> 27:19.229
After all, you
are the President.

27:19.720 --> 27:26.432
Tell me, Operation
Black Smoke? What is it?

27:29.760 --> 27:34.117
Black Smoke is an operation
Which has been running for

27:34.240 --> 27:39.109
decades. Twenty or so years
ago, we encountered a very

27:39.240 --> 27:43.358
unusual phenomenon near the
industrial zone in Pancevo,

27:44.040 --> 27:46.315
on the bones of ancient
plague victims...

27:46.480 --> 27:47.674
What!?

27:48.160 --> 27:51.436
It turned out that the plague
Virus develops an interesting

27:51.600 --> 27:54.717
trait when soaked in
sufficient quantities

27:54.880 --> 28:00.034
of ammonia and benzene. I'm not
a chemist so I cannot give you

28:00.160 --> 28:02.116
a precise explanation...

28:02.520 --> 28:09.198
Essentially - it brings
Dead cells to life!

28:11.160 --> 28:15.039
Our Services had great
benefits from those chemicals.

28:15.720 --> 28:19.030
Civil wars in Africa, the
Middle East conflicts...

28:20.080 --> 28:23.117
we were supplying
for everyone.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.188
Cancel the whole
thing at once!

28:27.360 --> 28:31.911
It's too late.Two hours ago
we have lost contact with

28:32.080 --> 28:34.992
the train that was
transporting it.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.953
It seems there have
been an accident...

28:38.160 --> 28:41.789
The chemical was released
into the atmosphere...

28:42.360 --> 28:46.512
We must... we must
evacuate the city!

28:46.720 --> 28:47.994
Certainly not.

28:48.160 --> 28:52.119
Tomorrow morning when
the NATO exercises are over,

28:52.320 --> 28:56.154
our special forces will
cover up the incident,

28:56.320 --> 28:59.357
using the Chernobyl template.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.353
And the inhabitants
of Pancevo?

29:04.360 --> 29:06.749
Collateral damage.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.032
Welcome to Pancevo.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.232
Why are you closing
the window?

29:26.400 --> 29:30.029
Because of the stench. They
don't even need a Welcome board.

29:31.160 --> 29:34.789
When it starts to stink,
you know you're in Pancevo.

29:35.400 --> 29:39.188
And so, on the most routine
of missions you get to pass

29:39.360 --> 29:43.035
through the most toxic city
in all of Europe. Not quite

29:43.160 --> 29:45.037
what you expected?

29:45.960 --> 29:49.873
Wanna hear the funny part?
People say that in these parts-

29:50.040 --> 29:51.917
Damn...

30:27.920 --> 30:29.239
He's dead.

30:35.560 --> 30:40.156
Mina, tell Savini to wait for
us at the next set of lights.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.315
Yes, Sir!

30:41.480 --> 30:45.075
Petrovic, contact
the local police.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.434
Yes, Sir!

30:47.320 --> 30:48.639
Mortimer?

30:50.600 --> 30:51.510
Yes?

30:51.840 --> 30:53.034
Look...

31:07.520 --> 31:10.318
Please don't let this be -
third time's the charm.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.198
Mina, stay in the car.

31:21.360 --> 31:24.636
The lap top really isn't
doing me much good right now.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.308
Watch the perimeter.

31:37.440 --> 31:40.113
Petrovic, have you
reached the locals?

31:40.280 --> 31:42.350
No response.
just static.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.800
Mina, call Savini

31:45.960 --> 31:47.712
Tell them to get
back here right now.

31:47.880 --> 31:48.710
Yes Sir.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.193
You hear that?

32:16.440 --> 32:17.714
I hear it...

33:10.440 --> 33:11.316
That's close enough

33:11.480 --> 33:13.436
Agent Reyes, Savini and
Bottin aren't answering

33:18.920 --> 33:21.559
Mina, get back in
the car, now, move it!

33:33.040 --> 33:36.476
Morty, let's go!!!
Morty! Let's move! Move!

33:47.760 --> 33:48.556
Mina?

33:49.160 --> 33:50.991
I'm fine, I'm fine...

34:15.920 --> 34:17.148
Let's go!

35:07.040 --> 35:11.750
Petrovic, try reaching anyone,
You understand? Anyone!

35:11.960 --> 35:14.394
Local police,school croosing
guard, I don't give a damn who.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.551
Find somebody!
- Yes Sir.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.673
Agent Savini!

35:53.880 --> 35:55.552
Agent Bottin!

35:56.440 --> 35:57.998
Bottin!

36:12.760 --> 36:14.796
Savini's dead, Dra.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.111
Agent Reyes, what about
the prisoner?

36:25.240 --> 36:26.673
The van is out of commission.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.956
We'll have to transfer
him to our car.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.913
I have a clear line of fire!

36:41.880 --> 36:43.552
I've found Bottin.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.956
Agent Reyes, are you ok?

36:55.600 --> 36:57.192
I'm fine...

36:57.440 --> 37:00.113
Dra! We have to
get out of here.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.878
Right now!

37:04.680 --> 37:08.673
Hey, we've run into some
unforeseen circumstances

37:08.840 --> 37:12.833
and we'll have to transfer
you to another vehicle.

37:13.280 --> 37:16.317
Don't do anything
stupid, alright?

37:19.880 --> 37:22.155
He's heard you.
Open it!

37:29.480 --> 37:31.232
Aim for the head.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.429
What?

37:32.600 --> 37:34.511
I said, aim for the heads.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.511
He's right. He's not moving.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.635
Alright, let's go!

38:16.480 --> 38:18.994
So you've started without me?

38:19.160 --> 38:20.434
Get down!

38:21.880 --> 38:26.795
Easy now, easy. We'll just get
to the car and then we move on.

38:27.160 --> 38:30.357
Move on? Looks like the
end of the line to me.

38:30.520 --> 38:35.310
They're all over the place.
What happened to them?

38:37.320 --> 38:39.311
We need to move faster.

38:39.480 --> 38:43.951
I'd love to, but these new
shoes give me a terrible blister.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.395
Is this some sort of war?

38:49.200 --> 38:51.350
War of the Worlds.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.198
What should we do, Mortimer?

38:55.360 --> 38:58.238
I think we should find a
local police station

38:58.400 --> 39:01.278
or something. Establish
communication links and

39:01.440 --> 39:03.351
wait for back-up.

39:03.520 --> 39:07.354
The closest police station is
nearby, behind the park.

39:07.520 --> 39:11.229
Petrovic, get back into the
car and start the engine!

39:11.400 --> 39:14.073
Move! Move! Move! C'mon!

39:29.320 --> 39:31.356
This one seems agile...

39:31.520 --> 39:33.033
A primary victim.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.434
Where'd he go?

39:36.280 --> 39:38.157
Shoot him in the head.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.874
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

39:41.080 --> 39:42.798
I said shoot him
in the head!

39:42.960 --> 39:43.870
Shut up!!

39:44.040 --> 39:46.838
Want him to become like
those two we left back there?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.514
Petrovic!
Do you hear me?

39:49.840 --> 39:51.353
Petrovic's gone.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.714
Petrovic!

39:52.880 --> 39:54.632
Adios, Petrovic...

39:55.800 --> 39:57.552
Mina, watch him!

39:59.200 --> 40:02.112
The tire is flat.
We'll have to walk.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.555
The Station is that way,
behind the park.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.079
It's not far.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.274
Mortimer, release him.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.879
What?

40:12.480 --> 40:14.277
Release him! Fast!

40:21.080 --> 40:22.559
Mina.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.668
We've hardly met, and
already so intimate.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.512
And how about we just
lave you here?

40:32.720 --> 40:33.709
Agent Millius!

40:33.880 --> 40:35.632
How d'you feel about that?

40:36.080 --> 40:39.072
You should have come in
a cheerleader uniform.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.428
Mina...

40:44.160 --> 40:46.515
Why don't you give me
a gun or something?

40:46.720 --> 40:48.119
My aim is very good.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.554
I'll bet.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.751
The building is right there.

41:59.200 --> 42:02.033
Get her off me!
Get her off me!

42:04.680 --> 42:06.113
Eat this!

42:12.760 --> 42:14.830
Give me back my gun.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.877
Give her back her weapon.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.439
That's my thanks?

42:19.960 --> 42:22.713
Thanks. Now give
me back my gun.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.398
Did He bite you?

42:31.160 --> 42:33.628
Now you become
like one of them.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.031
Feel free to pretend you
don't see what's going on.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.798
We have no time for this.

42:51.720 --> 42:55.554
Pull one more stunt like
That and I'll mess up that

42:55.920 --> 42:58.388
ironic smile of
yours for good.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.193
Let's go!

43:57.720 --> 43:59.119
Go, Dra!

44:45.840 --> 44:48.308
It seems like we
missed the party.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.112
You alright?

45:40.400 --> 45:42.152
Lines are dead.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.635
Can you contact the
base in Belgrade

45:49.800 --> 45:50.994
by the network?

45:51.160 --> 45:53.515
Yes, the system doesn't
look like it's damaged.

45:53.720 --> 45:54.789
But there's no power.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.520
So we'll have to find
a generator somewhere...

45:57.720 --> 45:59.119
We'll do.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.749
The wound has gone
numb, hasn't it?

46:02.480 --> 46:04.710
The speed of the
transformation depends

46:04.880 --> 46:06.552
on the severity of the bite.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.557
And how do you
know all that?

46:09.520 --> 46:12.318
Let's say I just
have a great instinct.

46:21.400 --> 46:25.518
We'll find some
sort of first aid kit.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.512
Here's something.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.116
Where did everybody go?

46:43.560 --> 46:46.393
Probably out handling
the riots.

46:47.160 --> 46:51.119
Eaten, infected,
or probably both.

46:58.360 --> 47:03.718
You speak only when
spoken to, clear?

47:06.520 --> 47:10.399
Or what? You gonna
ruin my smile?

47:11.080 --> 47:13.878
You can bet your
life on it!

47:20.800 --> 47:22.631
How'd you feel?

47:22.880 --> 47:24.438
Like crap.

47:24.600 --> 47:28.957
Inspector Belic and I will
check the rest of the premises.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.839
If he moves, kill him.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.437
They've stopped banging.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.114
Do you really think they quit?

47:48.400 --> 47:49.879
No...

47:59.840 --> 48:02.832
Crap...
To meet like this.

48:03.600 --> 48:06.956
OK, don't move and
shut your mouth.

48:43.440 --> 48:45.874
They took everything.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.030
There's no ammo too.

48:50.520 --> 48:52.158
This is bad.

48:55.160 --> 48:59.676
I've got two
more clips. You?

49:00.200 --> 49:03.476
One. We'll have
to economize.

49:35.360 --> 49:36.998
Detention.

49:54.040 --> 49:55.359
FREEZE!!

49:55.520 --> 49:56.714
You are sane!

49:56.920 --> 49:58.797
And you, are you sane?

49:58.960 --> 50:00.393
Anyone hurt?

50:01.280 --> 50:06.070
No, we're all fine, but
the gentleman behind the bars

50:07.520 --> 50:09.988
He asked us to lock him in.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.434
Sir...

50:17.440 --> 50:19.396
I'm a professor...

50:20.000 --> 50:21.479
Let's go.

50:22.840 --> 50:26.799
Today... I used to work
at the library...

50:28.480 --> 50:33.474
Now... it's all gone...
All those books...

50:35.160 --> 50:38.948
the knowlege of dead
civilisations...

50:39.600 --> 50:44.230
Everything will be fine, Sir.
We're with the police.

50:44.520 --> 50:48.115
I'm going to open the door.
We're going back.

50:48.240 --> 50:51.949
We'll find a place
where we will be safe.

51:01.160 --> 51:06.518
My wife.I didn't manage to
tell her not to wait for me.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.631
C'mon. Let's go.

51:26.680 --> 51:28.557
More survivors.

51:28.840 --> 51:32.150
Great. I am agent Milius.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.471
Was he any trouble?

51:47.720 --> 51:51.190
If he had been he wouldn't
still be sitting there.

51:51.400 --> 51:53.436
Pay no attention.

51:54.080 --> 51:57.470
She just can't resist
my boyish charm.

51:58.960 --> 52:03.192
When I got away from the station.
I ran into some weird soldier.

52:03.360 --> 52:06.830
He was shouting how armageddon
is coming and how he's

52:07.000 --> 52:11.152
been preparing for years
It looks as he was right.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.071
Rats from the trash!

52:54.960 --> 52:57.918
I'll send you back
to whence you came.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.152
Now let's see,this Prophet
of the Lord which tool shall

53:05.320 --> 53:07.311
he reach for next...

53:12.040 --> 53:14.952
The flaming
strength of the Lord!!

53:18.240 --> 53:20.390
His Will be done...

53:23.920 --> 53:27.435
The generator room is
down this corridor.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.115
I have to wash this.

53:43.720 --> 53:45.551
No water for me?

53:49.840 --> 53:52.798
I saved your life,
back there in the park.

53:52.960 --> 53:55.918
I was hoping for a
bit more recognition.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.878
I said thank you.

54:01.600 --> 54:06.116
I can't believe that my
camera fell just like that.

54:06.880 --> 54:09.713
I can't believe that in
The middle of this horror

54:09.880 --> 54:11.836
you're thinking about
your camera.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.434
This is probably the worst
thing that ever happened

54:14.600 --> 54:16.511
since the begining of
civilized world!

54:16.720 --> 54:19.029
And I'm a part of it
and I don't have a cam!

54:19.160 --> 54:21.071
Is't that shit just great?

54:23.480 --> 54:25.948
What is it now?
Are you angree?

54:26.280 --> 54:31.115
Well no,never mind.
I'm worried about Jovana.

54:33.280 --> 54:35.510
Why do you worry about me?

54:35.720 --> 54:39.998
Somehow you showed certain
promise at the very beginning.

54:42.040 --> 54:45.555
But it doesn't take too
long to see through it.

54:45.800 --> 54:47.279
Fear.

54:49.080 --> 54:51.116
You smell of fear.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.355
Well you smell of sweat.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.954
So, this is your first case?

55:01.800 --> 55:03.472
Hell of an initiation, huh?

55:03.680 --> 55:06.672
Look, just keep quiet, I'll
get you glass of water.

55:09.560 --> 55:12.358
I've been quiet for too long.

55:12.520 --> 55:17.310
Illegally imprisoned without
a shred of proof. And now

55:17.480 --> 55:24.113
as I'm going through this
city suddenly this crap?

55:25.320 --> 55:28.676
What are you playing at?
You want me to believe that

55:28.840 --> 55:31.673
you're so important someone
stage this whole thing out

55:31.840 --> 55:33.478
of spite towards you?

55:33.920 --> 55:35.273
No.

55:37.440 --> 55:41.433
I am just a stranger
in a strange land.

55:45.320 --> 55:47.834
Been that all my life.

55:50.280 --> 55:52.191
You talk too much.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.911
What... crap...

56:36.320 --> 56:39.039
The jerk... was right...

56:42.600 --> 56:44.477
How do you feel?

56:47.520 --> 56:52.958
The bite hurts. And the
whole left side, all numb.

56:53.240 --> 56:55.959
We have to get to
the generator,Dra.

56:56.160 --> 56:59.948
Put that bandage back
and let's go.

57:00.600 --> 57:04.036
I appreciate the fact that
you're trying to get my

57:04.160 --> 57:06.549
mind off of this, and all,

57:06.760 --> 57:11.515
But, Morty, I won't be
going with you...

57:19.880 --> 57:22.553
I thought you quit that.

57:25.760 --> 57:30.470
I tried. But it's all
That keeps me sane.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.315
Haunts you again?

57:36.120 --> 57:38.076
More than ever.

57:38.680 --> 57:41.114
More than ever, Dra...

57:41.480 --> 57:43.391
I'm so sorry.

57:47.280 --> 57:53.116
We'll talk about this later,
this is not the time, Draa.

57:53.960 --> 57:55.712
I know...

57:55.880 --> 57:57.438
C'mon...

58:07.120 --> 58:08.792
Is he ok?

58:11.280 --> 58:13.874
Why don't you find a rope
and tie him down.

58:14.040 --> 58:15.359
He hasn't got far to go.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.636
One more word out
of you and... -Mina!

58:25.160 --> 58:28.197
Listen, people, if he's
been infected why don't we

58:28.360 --> 58:29.873
shoot him right now?
Shoot him!

58:30.040 --> 58:31.393
Enough!

58:36.560 --> 58:39.074
I didn't see that one coming.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.395
Agent Reyes, what
are you doing?

58:45.680 --> 58:48.990
We have to re-start the
generator. Belic's injuries

58:49.160 --> 58:53.711
are too severe. If I take you,
I've no one to look after him.

58:54.520 --> 58:57.114
This way I watch him.

58:57.560 --> 59:01.633
I thought cops had better things
to do than to become heroes.

59:01.840 --> 59:05.833
Currently, currently nothing
better occurs to me.

59:06.920 --> 59:09.354
This ain't the wild wild west.

59:10.360 --> 59:12.794
Why don't you take
a look outside.

59:18.600 --> 59:25.676
Mina, watch Belic.
He's getting worse.

59:28.120 --> 59:30.554
You know what to do if he
starts turning into...

59:30.800 --> 59:32.028
No, agent Reyes, I...

59:32.160 --> 59:35.038
This is a direct
order, agent Millius.

59:38.680 --> 59:41.399
And we always obey orders.

59:42.880 --> 59:44.518
Yes, sir!

59:44.880 --> 59:46.632
Alright, let's go!

59:46.800 --> 59:49.439
You, follow me.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.517
I'm just a reporter...

59:52.720 --> 59:55.188
I'm not interested. Get up!

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:26.196
As soon as we go down,
look this door, understand?

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.919
OK.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.990
It looks deserted.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.676
Are you sure the generator
Is down there?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.833
I saw the blueprints
of the building.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.517
OK, here goes.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.795
So what's to stop me
shooting you right

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.560
in the back and get
the hell out of here?

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.230
You're not stupid.
You know that together

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.188
we got better chances of
lasting through the night.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.869
In situations like this one,
you're just slowing me down.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.116
OK then.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.389
If you try anything,
I'll kill you and not by a bullet

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:34.437
to the brain, but straight
through your heart, so you

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.310
can come back like one
of these things outside.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.910
The man is an artist.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.029
Art has nothing to do with it.
I just don't like you!

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.554
Cat.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.909
What?

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.516
It's always a cat.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.757
Siamese?

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.032
The brain.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.636
If the brain is intact, the
infected is not destroyed.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.674
How do you know all that?

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.273
Chernobyl, 1986.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:00.275
Really? And you were there then?
How old were you, five?

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.154
Not me. My father...

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.199
Let's find the damned generator
and get the hell out of here.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.230
Thanks.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.197
How are you feeling?

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.038
Never better.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.993
Why don't I get you some water?

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:42.514
Listen. you're just starting
out in this job.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.992
Please just
don't talk, relax.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:55.916
Just one thing.This job can
possess a man, it can become

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:04.317
an obsession don't let it
happen to you what

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.115
happened to Reyes.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.113
What happened to Reyes?

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:20.395
A stuppid accident that
ruined his life. The stupid

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:29.110
obsession that made him go
away on that day instead

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.115
of taking his wife.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:45.876
She went by herself
by train and sliped

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.709
She fell onto
the train tracks...

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.389
Don't let this job
obsess you so much

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:09.353
don't let it control your
life. Don't let it destroy

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.312
A bullet to the head now.
Please, Mina, please.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.998
A bullet, Mina, please.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.272
I'm sorry.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.475
It's getting hot here...

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.238
Quiet...

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.917
Here it is...

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:35.750
You see this one. It's
The only main switch.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.750
It's gonna turn all
on automatically.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.470
Let's try this way.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.796
Nothing happened.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.996
What are you doin'?

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:55.075
Sometimes you've just
got to give it a kick.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.917
I see.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.190
It seems some of your
collegues had the same idea.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.631
Behind it is the street.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.353
Quickly. Back!

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.918
Move!

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.509
Only three clips left!

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.156
We go for the door,we don't
care about the rest of them.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.477
Clear? Move it!!

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.350
Well you're free now!

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:25.992
You owe me one.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.991
Open the door!!

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.912
Open the god damn door!

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.674
Open the door, or I'll
shoot through it!

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.513
There are loads of them.
We are going to die!!

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:24.313
We are going to die!
- Get the chair!

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.392
Leave it! Leave it!

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.674
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.238
He was...

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.358
You did what you had
to do. Ok? Understand?

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.432
Hold the door!

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.271
We need to
check the network.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.553
Put me through to
Colonel Ironside. Now.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.914
The system is functional,
But the external link doesn't

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.629
work. It's almost as if it's
been shut down by central.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.637
At least we've got cable.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.552
That's just TV Pancevo.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.398
Wait, wait, hold on.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.391
This is live. Look!!

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.957
Did you see that?

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.835
In that park I kissed
for the first time

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.398
And hell and death were
cast into the pool of fire.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.835
This is the second death.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.072
Don't!

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.195
Can you operate the machinery?

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.914
It's time we announced to
the world what's happening

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.991
out there, you understand?

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.237
This is no good...

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.433
Why don't you put a Cartoon
Channel or something?

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.396
Look...

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.755
C'mon old man,
how hard can it be?

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.559
Lucifer invented those
demonic machines so that

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.988
everyone can use them!

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.116
That's him. That lunatic.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:10.152
You know, Jan, when all
this ends you should make

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.231
an interview with him...

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.709
I don't think I'll come
back here ever again.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.678
Brothers and sisters...
Woe to the earth and to

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.150
the sea, because the devil
is come down unto you,

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.311
having great wrath!

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.109
In those days, men shall seek
death and shall not find it.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.954
And they shall
desire to die

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.118
and death shall
fly from them.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.151
Could you please turn it down?

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.393
And I saw a city chained
in concrete and iron, and I saw

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:46.031
a city lapped by dark waters. And
I saw a way to repent ourselves!

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:52.232
A way to destroy the old serpent.
To redeem our sins against a planet

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.632
that we have turned into our
plaything! to pay for the filth

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.112
and toxic stench with which we
have filled our seas and oceans,

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.034
the jungles and forests we
have slain through our haughty

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.116
carelesness and gross neglect...

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.793
Please turn it down a bit.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.837
You kill the serpent
in the head!

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.514
Fire at their heads!
Blow apart their heads!

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.958
It's the only way!

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.559
Let me OUT!

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.159
Stop her!

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.154
Let me out!

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.959
Let me out!

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.273
Let me out!

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.556
Calm down, calm down!

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.672
They've breached it!
We have to get back!

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.037
Everyone get out of here.
Get back into the other room!

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.557
What a bad trip

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.431
Go!! Go!!

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.116
We've held them back.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.993
But we have a minute
or two at most.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.798
Jovana...

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.473
Let's move.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.199
Here's the way out!

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.237
This window leads out
into a side street.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.470
I've checked, there aren't
any of them out here!

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.113
Professor?

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.752
You go...

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.431
Professor, if you stay...

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:57.913
I know, but you heard the man.
The end of the world is coming.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.469
Our civilisation...

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.992
Let's go!!

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.117
We've been wathcing its decline
for decades and now the end is

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.674
upon us and it's all our own
fault,our own fault.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.953
Your wife. She's still
waiting for you.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.639
My wife? But she's dead.
She died ten days ago.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.960
I somehow forgot.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.434
Agent Reyes, c'mon!

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.797
Once again, professor.
Are you coming with us?

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.075
There are far more horrifying
Things than what is happening

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:13.280
to us now. To die, and come back.
This loathsome wandering...

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.190
without ever having known what
it is to love and be loved.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.180
It's dawn already.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.276
It looks safe here.
So, what's the plan?

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.995
I think the only smart thing
Is to try to reach the river,

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.435
steal a boat and
reach Belgrade.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.956
Wait, people. Maybe we should
find some shopping mall?

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.872
It would be too hard to secure,

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.700
and,believe me - they
would get in anyway!

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.916
I think the river's
a better plan.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.275
Beats a shopping
mall, definitely.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.159
Agent Reyes, what
about your weapon?

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.873
I have nothing. Mina, how
many shots left in yours?

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.793
What ever is left in
the clip.Three maybe.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.473
You?

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.180
Empty!

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.078
We have enough time
to get out of the city

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.756
before the authorities
contain the outbreak.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.797
How do you mean?

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.840
I mean Chernobyl.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.869
The nuclear catastrophe
was a conscious decision.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.873
It was the only way
to stop the contagion.

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.634
What do you mean?
You were there?

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.473
My father used to work
at the plant...

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.112
The primary victims killed
by the gas come back to life.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.320
Secondary victims, slain by
the primary ones, also spread

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.709
the infection further...

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.116
And your father?

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.472
Died.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.156
Twice.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.358
The river is there.
we're close.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.116
Look at them.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:48.628
That's so weird. As
if they're all sleeping.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.350
You're the expert.
What gives?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:59.200
No idea. This never
happened at Chernobyl.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.278
They didn't let it go
for long enough.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.719
Maybe they're trying
to get warm.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.633
Maybe it's too cold when
you're dead.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.839
Whatever it is, that river is
our only ticket out of here.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.670
What now, sheriff?

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.700
Quiet. Quiet. I'm thinking...

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.795
Ok... This is what we do...

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:34.508
I'm going down there. If
they stay still, perfect.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.160
If they rise, I'll try
to lure them to the wagon.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.116
As soon as the infected
come after me run to the river!

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.314
Run as if hell itself
is chasing you. Clear?

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.713
I don't think I'm gonna
Like this plan...

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.640
You don't want me along?

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.356
This is agent Milius's first
field case. It would be a shame

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:11.833
if she were not to complete it
successfully, wouldn't it?

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.630
Ok... here goes...

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.078
When I was a little boy,
There use to be this crazy man

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.715
That use to run through the
Neighbourhood and rat and rave.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:38.195
He would say weird things.
One of the things he used to say

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.300
That ticks in my mind
every time I look at this.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.515
He would say -

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:57.713
Hell is going to overflow and
the dead will rise forever!

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.879
Crazy old man?

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.715
Here goes...

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.276
He stopped...

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.359
Oh, shit!

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.829
Wait for my signal.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.798
That's our breach!
C'mon, go!

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.915
C'mon, let's go!

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.554
OK. We gotta go faster! You
guys, get down to the river!

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.120
Start the engine and wait!
I am going to get Reyes!

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.393
Disobeying a direct order?

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.111
C'mon. Go...

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.752
And miss all that fun?

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.840
Let's go!

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.351
Undo the ropes! I'll get
the engine starting, so

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.478
we don't waste
any time. C'mon!

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.710
Jan? Help me up.

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.236
I ain't waiting for nobody!

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.110
Smells like the End of Days!

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.509
Come to me,
children of darkness,

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:31.080
the time of
Redemption is nigh!

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.873
He's the only chance we have!

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.235
This way!

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.351
I've plenty of weapons
for all! Let us drive

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.636
this filth back
to whence it emerged!

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.880
I'm going after Reyes!

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:51.989
We'll both go!

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.475
Catch!!

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.469
Die you zombie bastard!

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.673
These guy's mighty quick.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.876
Primary victim...

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.830
You disobeyed a
direct order?

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.954
I found the
instructions unclear.

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.840
Which part of
,,run and don't stop''

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.110
did you find
lacking in clarity?

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.033
All of it!

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.315
The Prisoner?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.991
Finish your mission!

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.717
Yes, Sir!

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:34.350
We're going live in five,
four, three, two...

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:41.640
Citizens of Serbia, a few
hours ago I have been informed

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:46.276
about the incident in Pancevo.
Dangerous, toxic chemicals

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:51.514
have been released into the
air and have poisoned a large

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:56.953
number of inhabitants. Our elite
military and police units, in

01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.720
cooperation with our NATO allies,
have set up a quarantine zone

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:05.839
perimeter around the entire
municipality of Pancevo,

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:13.070
and have commenced two hours ago
to evacuate surviving citizens.

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:26.911
Also. I promise that I will have
this incident thoroughly

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:32.552
investigated and that I will use
all my power and influence to

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:36.389
discover which government
agencies have been working

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:42.160
against the public interest, and
to bring all those directly

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.989
responsible before
the face of justice.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.269
Thank you.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.633
Thank you...

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.429
Mr. President,

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:59.478
the Chief of Bureau
is asking to see you.

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.740
Of course.

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.473
I heard your speech.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.910
I expect to see your resignation.

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.959
I thought you would
be smarter than that.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:22.300
No one can protect you now.
Certainly not your NATO friends.

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:26.229
They're not friends.
Merely a necessary evil.

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:32.237
I will not rest until all
of you are brought to justice.

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.078
So, you've got two
guns, and I have a sword.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.111
Who's got better
fighting chances?

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.920
Well, I've got
two empty guns.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.558
And doubt you're gonna
come with me willingly.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.554
You know,I keep saying,

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.480
what a shame that we meet
under these circumstances.

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.115
What a shame I'm
Out of ammo.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.158
Looks like the first field
assignment has to remain

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.231
uncompleted.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:41.114
Maybe one day
we'll meet again.

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.031
I doubt it.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:00.872
Mina, the prisoner?
He got away?

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.717
Yes. He just
disappeared.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:10.035
Of course.
Doesn't really matter.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.709
My first field assignment
was a complete disaster.

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.474
I'll tell you about
it sometime.

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.718
You certenly have proven
your skills with a gun?

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.111
I guess so.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.636
Mina, good job.

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.436
Thank you, sir.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.633
By the way...

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.872
Honestly, who
was the prisoner?

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.240
Nobody special.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:03.755
And He shall raise with his
hands the Sword of Vengeance.

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.237
The Flaming Blade of
the Lord's Retribution.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.439
And his eyes were as
a flame of fire.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.754
And he had a name written,
which no man knoweth but himself.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.912
Damn Serbia.
