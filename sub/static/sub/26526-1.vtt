00:48.613 --> 00:49.812
- No!
- Calm down!

00:49.814 --> 00:51.848
No, I don't wanna!

00:51.850 --> 00:53.818
No, I don't wanna!

00:53.820 --> 00:55.351
I don't wanna!

00:55.353 --> 00:58.689
I said, I don't want it!
You're giving me too much!

00:58.691 --> 01:01.558
Too much!
You know that.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.894
No! No, I'm not going to.

01:03.896 --> 01:06.163
- No!
- Grab her legs. Grab her legs.

01:06.165 --> 01:07.731
No!

01:07.733 --> 01:11.067
- Take it easy, Eleanor.
- No, I don't wanna go in there.

01:11.069 --> 01:15.505
No, I don't wanna go in there.
No, I don't wanna go in there.

01:15.507 --> 01:18.243
- No. No.
- Settle down.

01:19.811 --> 01:21.678
Please. Please.
Please, don't hurt me.

01:30.956 --> 01:34.056
Okay. It should be fine now.

01:41.266 --> 01:43.400
All right. She's
gonna be all right.

01:43.402 --> 01:44.601
All right.

01:44.603 --> 01:46.270
Yeah, okay.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.537
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:47.539 --> 01:50.308
Okay. Let's go.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.612
Okay, get
back into your room.

01:54.914 --> 01:56.316
All right.

02:36.122 --> 02:38.621
Hello? Let... Let me out.

02:38.623 --> 02:40.190
Yeah.

02:40.192 --> 02:42.629
I-I need to go to
the-the bathroom.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.931
I need to... I have to go...
The bathroom.

02:48.933 --> 02:51.300
Please, somebody.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.068
Somebody, help.

02:53.070 --> 02:55.172
Come out. Help me.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.976
Please, I... I need help.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.778
It really hurts.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.046
Oh, no.

03:02.048 --> 03:04.248
Oh, no, it hurts. Sorry.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.848
I'm sorry.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.650
Oh, Mama.

03:19.397 --> 03:24.467
I need to
use a telephone!

03:24.469 --> 03:28.839
I... I want to use a phone!

03:28.841 --> 03:32.375
I-I need to use
a telephone!

03:32.377 --> 03:34.143
I heard you so.

03:34.145 --> 03:35.779
Don't you wanna
clean up first?

03:35.781 --> 03:38.715
No, I... I wanna
use a phone.

03:38.717 --> 03:40.382
Okay. Okay.

03:50.195 --> 03:52.097
<i>Hello?</i>

03:54.599 --> 03:55.933
Is...?

03:55.935 --> 03:59.335
Is this Patients' Rights?

03:59.337 --> 04:00.570
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

04:00.572 --> 04:04.907
My name is Eleanor Riese.

04:04.909 --> 04:07.042
And...

04:07.044 --> 04:09.379
I want a lawyer.

04:57.795 --> 05:01.332
We're hoping we can get
her out by the weekend.

05:10.274 --> 05:11.808
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.610
I'm here to see
Eleanor Riese.

05:13.612 --> 05:14.777
I'm her lawyer.

05:14.779 --> 05:16.615
May I see your ID?

05:24.255 --> 05:26.125
You can wait there.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.527
Okay, but I'm only gonna
wait five minutes.

05:31.529 --> 05:33.930
Then I'm gonna call
the state board of hospitals

05:33.932 --> 05:37.166
and complain that
you won't let me see my client.

05:37.168 --> 05:40.639
I'll see if I can find
a nurse to show you up.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.376
Thank you.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.688
All right, sweetheart.
Now drink up.

05:58.690 --> 06:00.992
Take a little pill.
That's it.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.529
I want you to know
you're dealing with

06:05.531 --> 06:07.731
a very explosive
patient.

06:07.733 --> 06:08.668
Thank you.

06:10.502 --> 06:14.072
You don't need to touch me.
Don't touch me.

06:24.149 --> 06:25.785
Ms. Riese?

06:27.086 --> 06:29.519
I'm Colette Hughes.

06:29.521 --> 06:31.591
We spoke on the phone.
I'm here to help you.

06:33.024 --> 06:36.993
Yeah, everybody's here
to help me.

06:36.995 --> 06:39.598
Yeah, that's why
I need help.

06:42.233 --> 06:43.567
You can talk here.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.735
Thank you.

06:45.737 --> 06:49.141
I'm sorry. I only speak
to my clients in privacy.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.529
I don't like
lawyers.

07:13.531 --> 07:15.199
Why not?

07:15.201 --> 07:17.534
Why not?

07:17.536 --> 07:20.269
'Cause of
the un-defending defender.

07:20.271 --> 07:22.673
That's what I call
a public defender.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.640
And you-you
wanna know why?

07:24.642 --> 07:26.743
'Cause he doesn't
defend me.

07:26.745 --> 07:30.214
When they tried to
keep me here, I told him:

07:30.216 --> 07:32.449
"I don't wanna stay here."

07:32.451 --> 07:34.050
And he said
I didn't mind.

07:34.052 --> 07:36.418
He didn't listen to me.

07:36.420 --> 07:39.889
He didn't listen
to me at all.

07:39.891 --> 07:41.759
If I represent you
in this lawsuit,

07:41.761 --> 07:43.961
I will listen.
You have my word.

07:43.963 --> 07:47.296
Aw. I know how
you think about me.

07:47.298 --> 07:50.034
Yeah, like I'm crazy.
Yeah.

07:50.036 --> 07:54.240
People, they don't care about
their word with crazy people.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.106
Tell me
I'm not right.

07:57.108 --> 07:58.942
Just tell me
I'm not right.

07:58.944 --> 08:02.878
You don't know how I feel
about you. We just met.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.716
And I do keep my word
with everyone.

08:12.490 --> 08:15.091
How long have
you been a lawyer?

08:15.093 --> 08:16.692
Two years.

08:16.694 --> 08:20.197
Aren't you kinda old
to be a lawyer only two years?

08:20.199 --> 08:22.298
I mean,
what are you, slow?

08:22.300 --> 08:23.500
No.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.267
I'm not slow.

08:25.269 --> 08:28.839
I was just doing other things
before becoming a lawyer.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.174
Like what?
Belly dancing?

08:32.177 --> 08:33.312
How'd you guess?

08:41.284 --> 08:43.453
Yeah, why do you
wanna help me?

08:43.455 --> 08:46.323
Because I want
the same thing you want.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.157
I want doctors
to respect your rights

08:48.159 --> 08:49.493
when you're in
the hospital

08:49.495 --> 08:50.826
and not give
you medication

08:50.828 --> 08:52.264
without your permission.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.267
What about money?

08:57.269 --> 08:58.901
I can't pay you.

08:58.903 --> 09:01.137
If we win,
I'll get paid for my time.

09:01.139 --> 09:02.705
If we don't, I won't.

09:02.707 --> 09:05.675
If we win, you'll get money too.
But only a little.

09:05.677 --> 09:08.247
This won't be
a damages case.

09:10.015 --> 09:12.516
There's something else
you have to know.

09:12.518 --> 09:15.685
I can pursue
getting you released now.

09:15.687 --> 09:19.222
But if you want me
to proceed with a suit,

09:19.224 --> 09:21.925
if I get you released
right away,

09:21.927 --> 09:25.796
the court might dismiss the case
because they would say

09:25.798 --> 09:28.131
that you weren't
in harm anymore.

09:28.133 --> 09:32.471
But if you prefer, I can just
concentrate getting you out.

09:34.639 --> 09:36.140
Well, so...

09:36.142 --> 09:38.440
So if I sue
the hospital,

09:38.442 --> 09:40.977
you can make sure

09:40.979 --> 09:44.781
they can't give people
any drugs they want to?

09:44.783 --> 09:46.616
No matter what
it does to them?

09:46.618 --> 09:48.818
If we win the case,

09:48.820 --> 09:52.522
no hospital in the state
can do that to people

09:52.524 --> 09:55.090
on 3-to 17-day
involuntary holds

09:55.092 --> 09:56.761
just because
the hospital wants to.

09:59.264 --> 10:05.303
You would be representing
150,000 people with this case.

10:15.413 --> 10:17.714
You know,
I-I like your clothes.

10:17.716 --> 10:19.682
But your hair...

10:19.684 --> 10:21.618
gotta change.

10:21.620 --> 10:22.888
Are...

10:23.788 --> 10:25.658
Yeah, you're hired.

10:56.455 --> 10:57.686
No "hello"
or anything?

10:57.688 --> 10:59.890
Oh, sorry.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.794
I forgot you were
coming over tonight.

11:08.332 --> 11:10.199
Hungry?

11:10.201 --> 11:12.502
Professor Cohen,
it's Colette Hughes.

11:12.504 --> 11:13.871
I'm sorry to call
so late.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.105
I think I got the plaintiff
for a case

11:16.107 --> 11:18.677
for informed consent
for medication.

11:21.346 --> 11:24.247
She's at St. Mary's.
Her name's Eleanor Riese.

11:24.249 --> 11:27.618
And she's been exposed to
medication without her consent

11:27.620 --> 11:30.786
over numerous
hospital stays.

11:30.788 --> 11:34.358
Blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.460
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

11:37.462 --> 11:39.696
Blessed art thou
among women.

11:39.698 --> 11:43.967
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

12:07.192 --> 12:09.595
Please help me.

12:11.296 --> 12:13.199
Please.

12:15.399 --> 12:17.032
Help me.

12:17.034 --> 12:19.301
Help me, please!

12:19.303 --> 12:20.936
Please.

12:20.938 --> 12:23.373
Help me, please.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.475
Please, help me.

12:26.477 --> 12:28.279
Please!

12:29.581 --> 12:30.914
Here.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.315
Please, help me. God.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.721
- No.
- Karen.

12:36.888 --> 12:38.188
Help.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.022
Hey, hey,
I'm gonna get you out.

12:40.024 --> 12:42.691
I'm gonna get you out.

12:42.693 --> 12:44.060
Karen.

12:44.062 --> 12:45.362
- No.
- Karen.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.028
- I'm here.
- No! Help me.

12:47.030 --> 12:49.934
You aren't alone.

13:00.879 --> 13:03.946
She's diagnosed with
chronic paranoid schizophrenia

13:03.948 --> 13:06.049
with slight
mental retardation.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.718
She can be
highly mistrustful.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.487
She gets very angry.

13:10.489 --> 13:14.757
She can be loud, but she's not
a danger to herself or others.

13:14.759 --> 13:16.758
That's good.

13:16.760 --> 13:20.796
She has extreme panic attacks
because she has a fear of dying.

13:20.798 --> 13:22.531
That's why
she committed herself.

13:22.533 --> 13:24.667
- Because she wanted help for her fear.
- Mm-hmm.

13:24.669 --> 13:27.537
But when the hospital started
doubling her medication,

13:27.539 --> 13:28.938
and she started refusing it,

13:28.940 --> 13:30.672
that's when they
then said that

13:30.674 --> 13:32.908
she had a delusion
about her medication.

13:32.910 --> 13:36.079
- I see.
- I think she knows exactly

13:36.081 --> 13:37.781
what her medication's
doing to her,

13:37.783 --> 13:39.281
and she's furious
about it.

13:39.283 --> 13:41.517
I think she has the will
to see this through.

13:41.519 --> 13:44.287
How many patients
did you represent

13:44.289 --> 13:47.424
in hearings last year
as part of your job?

13:47.426 --> 13:49.026
About 200.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.294
Uh-huh, and how many other
patients' hearings

13:51.296 --> 13:52.929
did you
supervise?

13:52.931 --> 13:54.196
Six hundred.

13:54.198 --> 13:56.431
And that job
you have in San Mateo

13:56.433 --> 13:59.569
um, your advocacy group,
how far is San Mateo?

13:59.571 --> 14:02.004
- Only an hour.
- Uh-huh.

14:02.006 --> 14:04.373
If you fly over
the cars.

14:04.375 --> 14:07.410
Now, listen to me, I make
a good living here teaching.

14:07.412 --> 14:09.878
I can afford to take on
whatever I want.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.281
But this case?
This case?

14:11.283 --> 14:13.049
This could take years.

14:13.051 --> 14:16.685
And you're not gonna be able
to have any private clients.

14:16.687 --> 14:18.888
It's gonna make
your job harder.

14:18.890 --> 14:21.959
And, uh, you're not gonna
be making a penny.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.593
Plus, which, no court...

14:23.595 --> 14:26.161
Federal, California.
...has ever rendered a decision

14:26.163 --> 14:27.863
in favor of
a case like this one.

14:27.865 --> 14:30.867
But if we win, we'll get rights
for people who, right now

14:30.869 --> 14:33.570
have fewer rights about
what goes into their own bodies

14:33.572 --> 14:35.906
than criminals in prison.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.874
You're right.

14:37.876 --> 14:39.943
And all we have to do
is beat St. Mary's

14:39.945 --> 14:42.344
and all the associations.

14:42.346 --> 14:45.781
Not to mention the, uh, county
councils across the state.

14:45.783 --> 14:47.684
And the researchers
and the lawyers

14:47.686 --> 14:49.051
St. Mary's
is going to hire,

14:49.053 --> 14:50.487
and the money they'll spend.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.888
You can't discourage me.

14:52.890 --> 14:57.326
I mean, I'm actually not
trying to discourage you.

14:57.328 --> 14:59.728
I just want you to know
what you're up against.

14:59.730 --> 15:02.031
I appreciate it.

15:02.033 --> 15:05.167
I'm honored to be working on
this case with you, Mr. Cohen.

15:05.169 --> 15:08.006
Thank you. Call me Mort.

15:12.376 --> 15:14.544
Hi. I'm here to see Ms....

15:14.546 --> 15:16.579
I'm sorry,
but you'll have to wait.

15:16.581 --> 15:18.147
But I have
an appointment.

15:18.149 --> 15:20.282
If you wanna complain to
the state hospital board,

15:20.284 --> 15:23.219
Dr. Booker said he'd be happy
to tell them how busy we are.

15:23.221 --> 15:24.887
We may not be able
to let you up

15:24.889 --> 15:28.424
to see Ms. Riese
this morning or even today.

15:32.263 --> 15:33.399
Thank you, ma'am.

15:49.514 --> 15:52.214
I'm trying to talk to
my friend, Sister Florence.

15:52.216 --> 15:53.617
Why don't you
leave me alone?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.285
You're not supposed to
be on the phone.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.919
You're supposed to be
in art therapy.

15:56.921 --> 15:58.988
Who wants to make
a stupid woolen octopus?

15:58.990 --> 16:01.056
If you won't let me
make my rosaries,

16:01.058 --> 16:02.392
I'll talk to my friend.

16:02.394 --> 16:03.294
Okay.

16:17.308 --> 16:18.608
Eleanor.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.109
No.

16:20.111 --> 16:22.179
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

16:22.181 --> 16:23.780
Eleanor,
we have an appointment.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.580
We don't
have an appointment.

16:25.582 --> 16:28.050
We had an appointment
at 9:15.

16:28.052 --> 16:29.685
- I'm sorry...
- Yeah, you don't think

16:29.687 --> 16:32.354
I got better things to do
than wait for you all day.

16:32.356 --> 16:34.458
I told you,
I don't need a slow lawyer.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.593
I was on time.
I just couldn't get...

16:36.595 --> 16:38.494
Yeah, thought
you looked bad yesterday.

16:38.496 --> 16:40.629
You look more like a patient
than a lawyer.

16:40.631 --> 16:41.930
That's the idea.

16:41.932 --> 16:43.598
I couldn't
get past the desk.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.636
I had to do this, so that I
could come and see you.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.970
- Oh!
- <i>I-I-I just can't...</i>

16:48.972 --> 16:53.108
I bet that'll show
those stupid doctors.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.377
Yeah, there's
no one in here.

16:55.379 --> 16:58.281
I'm looking forward to getting
started as much as you are.

16:58.283 --> 17:01.150
Yeah, yeah. I don't want
you to start with me.

17:01.152 --> 17:04.520
There is a patient.
She's all tied up in restraints.

17:04.521 --> 17:06.855
- I told her I had a lawyer.
- I'll look into it.

17:06.857 --> 17:09.558
Get her out.
Her name is Karen Winkle.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.026
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:11.028 --> 17:13.296
- I want you to get her out.
- I'll do what I can.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.064
Now I'm here
to work with you.

17:15.066 --> 17:18.767
I don't want you to do anything
for me. Go do something for her.

17:18.769 --> 17:20.969
It took me an hour and a half
to get up here.

17:20.971 --> 17:22.638
We only have 45 minutes.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.339
I'll help her
when I can.

17:24.342 --> 17:28.113
No, no, no. I'm not doing
anything until you help Karen.

17:30.515 --> 17:32.251
Come on. Let's go.

17:37.722 --> 17:40.459
I told you
I'd get you out.

17:42.693 --> 17:43.892
Yeah.

17:43.894 --> 17:45.996
I got a lawyer.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.466
I know I'm late. I had to take
care of something unexpected.

17:49.468 --> 17:52.567
Well, you'll have
to reschedule the meeting.

17:52.569 --> 17:56.605
With drive time? Two hours?

17:58.209 --> 18:00.410
"Whenever I'm held in
a psychiatric hospital,

18:00.412 --> 18:02.010
"I am given
antipsychotic drugs

18:02.012 --> 18:04.346
"such as Thorazine, Mellaril,
Navane, Serentil,

18:04.348 --> 18:06.248
"against my will,
without my permission

18:06.250 --> 18:08.049
and invariably
without my consent."

18:08.051 --> 18:09.719
Yeah, don't forget
how it makes

18:09.721 --> 18:12.588
my vision blurry
and my feet all swollen.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.289
So it makes it hard
for me to walk.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.558
- I haven't forgotten.
- And the hospital staff,

18:16.560 --> 18:19.496
they get angry at me, 'cause
I'm not doing things right.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.430
I've put it all in here.
Really, I have.

18:21.432 --> 18:24.100
Yeah, yeah.
And-and-and say that

18:24.102 --> 18:26.469
it makes my hands shake
and my head twitch,

18:26.471 --> 18:28.738
so it makes me look
even crazier than I am.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.774
It's here, I promise.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.710
Yeah, and then you have to say
how I get scared.

18:34.712 --> 18:39.414
And then they give me more drugs
that make me even more scared.

18:39.416 --> 18:42.218
Yeah, sometimes
I don't even try and fight them,

18:42.220 --> 18:44.487
because if I don't
swallow the drugs,

18:44.489 --> 18:46.622
then-then they threaten me
with needles.

18:46.624 --> 18:48.324
And I don't want needles.

18:48.326 --> 18:50.359
I don't wanna go in
the torture chamber.

18:50.361 --> 18:52.461
If you could just be quiet
for two minutes,

18:52.463 --> 18:54.296
I could read
your entire declaration.

18:54.298 --> 18:57.336
You could sign it, and then
I can work on getting you out.

18:59.903 --> 19:01.606
Okay.

19:02.973 --> 19:04.673
"The side effects of
these drugs..."

19:04.675 --> 19:05.874
One thing:

19:05.876 --> 19:07.742
Can you get some beads,

19:07.744 --> 19:09.444
so that I can make
my rosaries?

19:09.446 --> 19:12.414
They want me to make
a stupid woolen octopus.

19:12.416 --> 19:14.316
But they won't let me
make my rosaries.

19:14.318 --> 19:16.085
'cause they think
I have a delusion.

19:16.087 --> 19:20.257
But I am a member
of a rosary club.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.757
And they gave me
an award. Yeah.

19:22.759 --> 19:25.196
I need to make
my rosaries.

19:26.263 --> 19:27.365
Okay.

19:28.266 --> 19:29.599
Yeah.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.299
"The side effects
of these drugs..."

19:31.301 --> 19:33.937
What religion are you?

19:33.939 --> 19:35.073
I was raised
Catholic.

19:44.015 --> 19:45.918
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:52.289 --> 19:54.590
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

19:54.592 --> 19:56.361
I'd call the home.

19:57.694 --> 19:59.761
I'll come back.
I'll find you.

19:59.763 --> 20:02.364
Back inside in
five minutes, guys.

20:02.366 --> 20:04.232
Eleanor.

20:04.234 --> 20:06.236
This is Morton Cohen.

20:06.238 --> 20:09.771
Professor of constitutional law
at Golden Gate University.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.440
He's the lawyer
I told you about.

20:11.442 --> 20:13.943
The one who's gonna be
senior counsel on your case.

20:13.945 --> 20:15.443
Hello.

20:15.445 --> 20:17.313
- Hi.
- It's nice to meet you.

20:17.315 --> 20:19.914
- This is a very important case.
- Yeah, I know.

20:19.916 --> 20:21.883
You're representing
150,000 people.

20:21.885 --> 20:23.422
Are you Jewish?

20:24.622 --> 20:26.889
- Yes.
- I thought so.

20:26.891 --> 20:29.058
Yeah,
you're my Jewish lawyer.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.992
She's my Catholic lawyer.
It's perfect,

20:30.994 --> 20:33.496
'cause I was born Jewish,
and then I converted.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.230
I'm now a Catholic.

20:35.232 --> 20:37.400
That reminds me. I...

20:37.402 --> 20:39.634
I got you these.
Hope they're okay.

20:39.636 --> 20:42.037
Oh, you remembered.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.738
Thank you.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.141
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

20:45.143 --> 20:47.176
No, they're perfect.

20:47.178 --> 20:50.246
That's my mission.
My mission is making rosaries

20:50.248 --> 20:51.913
for Jesus
and the Blessed Mother.

20:51.915 --> 20:53.615
- I see.
- I've been making them

20:53.617 --> 20:54.850
since I was 15.

20:54.852 --> 20:56.486
- Since you were 15? Ah.
- Fifteen.

20:56.488 --> 20:59.721
I don't know how good they are,
but I'm doing my best.

20:59.723 --> 21:01.557
That's what
Father Murray says.

21:01.559 --> 21:03.926
You just have
to do your best.

21:03.928 --> 21:05.594
Yeah.

21:05.596 --> 21:07.766
I can make you a rosary
if you like.

21:09.601 --> 21:13.369
Well, you'd very much like
a rosary, wouldn't you?

21:13.371 --> 21:15.574
Yeah,
I'd like a rosary.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.242
Here you go.

21:20.244 --> 21:22.045
You okay with dogs?

21:22.047 --> 21:23.612
Yeah, I'm-I'm okay.

21:23.614 --> 21:25.483
Yeah, that's Bear.

21:27.785 --> 21:30.219
That's a marlin.

21:30.221 --> 21:32.787
I caught that off
the coast of Florida.

21:32.789 --> 21:35.056
- Oh.
- Yeah.

21:35.058 --> 21:36.725
And this is a bass.

21:36.727 --> 21:38.326
This is a pike.

21:38.328 --> 21:41.463
Pike. Over here
we have a marlin.

21:41.465 --> 21:43.900
Ask me how long it took
to reel that guy in.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.236
How long did it take
to reel that guy in?

21:46.238 --> 21:49.305
It took me three hours.
Have a seat.

21:49.307 --> 21:51.274
You sure
you're okay with dogs?

21:51.276 --> 21:52.507
Yeah, I'm okay.

21:52.509 --> 21:54.112
Good boy.

21:55.780 --> 21:58.747
All right. So
you've seen the care package

21:58.749 --> 22:00.415
that the hospital
sent over?

22:00.417 --> 22:02.619
Oh, my God.

22:02.621 --> 22:05.921
Hundreds of pages
for a 13-page complaint?

22:05.923 --> 22:07.456
Trying to bury us
in paperwork.

22:07.458 --> 22:08.757
I warned you.

22:08.759 --> 22:11.326
They got the money
and the medical experts.

22:11.328 --> 22:12.661
So let's split it up.

22:12.663 --> 22:14.463
I'll take constitutional
common law,

22:14.465 --> 22:18.234
and you take drugs, mental
health and statutory law issues.

22:18.236 --> 22:19.434
- Okay.
- Okay?

22:19.436 --> 22:20.671
Can I...?

22:22.707 --> 22:24.242
All right.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.380
No fishing for a while.

22:47.097 --> 22:49.665
Chope Community Hospital
about a Mr. Morris?

22:49.667 --> 22:52.901
Tell them I'll be there at 11
on Mr. Morris's behalf.

22:52.903 --> 22:54.737
Ms. Hughes?

22:54.739 --> 22:57.539
Oh, yes. Just one minute,
Mr. Grainger.

22:57.541 --> 23:00.943
She'll be there at 11
for Mr. Morris.

23:00.945 --> 23:03.345
Patients' Rights
Advocates.

23:03.347 --> 23:05.216
It's for you.

23:08.185 --> 23:10.719
This is Colette Hughes.

23:10.721 --> 23:12.322
No, today.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.823
I want her
released today.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.357
I'll be in later
to sign the form.

23:16.359 --> 23:17.862
Thank you.

23:19.396 --> 23:20.564
One moment.

23:22.166 --> 23:26.169
All right. Put that...
Put that in that one.

23:26.171 --> 23:29.004
Yeah, and this one.
You can put that one.

23:29.006 --> 23:31.507
Yeah. Yeah.

23:31.509 --> 23:34.142
Yeah, you can
put that in... No.

23:34.144 --> 23:36.511
Okay, but be careful.
I don't...

23:36.513 --> 23:40.048
All right. Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

23:40.050 --> 23:42.951
Hang on. Hang on.
Look.

23:42.953 --> 23:45.354
I made these for you.

23:45.356 --> 23:47.690
Oh, they're...
That's beautiful.

23:47.692 --> 23:50.426
I made them with
the rainbow colors.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.797
You see how they sparkle?

23:53.364 --> 23:55.363
Yeah, you'd never know
they were plastic.

23:55.365 --> 23:57.966
No, you wouldn't.
Thank you again.

23:57.968 --> 24:01.069
You wanna see the other ones
I made? I made five of them.

24:01.071 --> 24:03.707
Eleanor,
don't you want to go home?

24:05.343 --> 24:06.542
Oh, yeah.

24:06.544 --> 24:09.044
- Yeah. Got everything?
- Yes.

24:09.046 --> 24:10.613
Okay. Yeah.

24:10.615 --> 24:14.048
Bye. This is my lawyer.
You're gonna be sorry.

24:14.050 --> 24:15.651
Yeah.

24:15.653 --> 24:18.953
Oh, wait,
I got something for you.

24:18.955 --> 24:20.590
Yeah. Yeah.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.326
Hang on.

24:23.595 --> 24:26.061
Here. You're nice.

24:26.063 --> 24:28.263
Yeah.
I'm not suing you.

24:28.265 --> 24:30.101
Thank you, Eleanor.

24:32.502 --> 24:34.036
Oh, yeah.

24:34.038 --> 24:37.440
They got an elevator here.
I'm glad.

24:37.442 --> 24:40.808
Steps are horrid
for me.

24:52.123 --> 24:53.989
Why do you keep
looking at your watch?

24:53.991 --> 24:55.458
Because
I'm on a schedule.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.459
Do I turn on
the next street?

24:57.461 --> 25:00.363
Yeah, but we're not
going home right now.

25:00.365 --> 25:02.264
Why not?

25:02.266 --> 25:05.167
'Cause... 'cause I phoned
my friend, Sister Florence,

25:05.169 --> 25:07.636
and I asked her to
join us for a picnic.

25:07.638 --> 25:09.104
Oh, I'm sorry, Eleanor,

25:09.106 --> 25:11.472
but I don't have time
for a picnic right now.

25:11.474 --> 25:14.142
I thought you said I was
your most important client.

25:14.144 --> 25:15.643
Well, you are,
but I have

25:15.645 --> 25:17.883
a lot of other things
I need to do too.

25:19.784 --> 25:22.418
Don't you want to celebrate
with me 'cause I got out?

25:22.420 --> 25:25.354
Of course,
but I... I have a very...

25:25.356 --> 25:26.855
You're a big-shot
lawyer.

25:26.857 --> 25:29.491
I'm mentally ill.
So I don't know anything.

25:29.493 --> 25:30.625
I never said that.

25:30.627 --> 25:32.461
Gonna ruin my whole day.

25:32.463 --> 25:34.830
Yeah, no,
I planned this picnic.

25:34.832 --> 25:37.298
Yeah, Sister Florence
already bought food for you.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.701
I'm sorry, but you never
told me about a picnic.

25:39.703 --> 25:41.871
You're like everybody else.
You don't care.

25:41.873 --> 25:42.871
I do care about you.

25:42.873 --> 25:44.305
And I said I'm sorry,

25:44.307 --> 25:46.307
but I can't
go to the picnic.

25:46.309 --> 25:48.344
But I'll be happy
to drop you,

25:48.346 --> 25:51.316
so that you and Sister Florence
can celebrate.

25:59.857 --> 26:01.856
Are you sure
you'll be all right?

26:01.858 --> 26:03.691
Yeah, I'll be fine.

26:03.693 --> 26:06.461
Sister Florence will
drop me off at my apartment

26:06.463 --> 26:08.197
on the way back
to the convent.

26:08.199 --> 26:09.231
Are you sure?

26:09.233 --> 26:10.999
That's right.

26:11.001 --> 26:12.535
We can take the bus.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.003
Yeah, we'll just
take the bus.

26:14.005 --> 26:16.741
I've been taking
the bus for years.

26:18.609 --> 26:21.242
Well, I'll call you later.
Nice to meet you, Sister.

26:21.244 --> 26:23.478
Oh, it's nice
meeting you too.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.480
Eleanor tells me
you're Catholic,

26:25.482 --> 26:27.018
but you don't
practice anymore.

26:33.857 --> 26:35.391
Why are you still here?

26:35.393 --> 26:38.427
Big-shot lawyer with more
important things to do.

26:38.429 --> 26:41.330
You think I can't
get around on my own?

26:41.332 --> 26:44.201
You know, I got around on my own
before I had a lawyer.

27:07.791 --> 27:09.190
Hi, Robert.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.692
<i>Who's Robert?</i>

27:10.694 --> 27:11.793
<i>This is Eleanor Riese.</i>

27:11.795 --> 27:14.029
Oh, Eleanor.

27:14.031 --> 27:16.498
I didn't know
I gave you my number.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.799
You didn't.

27:17.801 --> 27:19.802
I looked you up
in the phone book.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.836
I'm very good
with the phone book.

27:21.838 --> 27:23.972
It says "C. Hughes."

27:23.974 --> 27:26.076
But I know the C
was for "Colette."

27:27.412 --> 27:29.611
- Is something wrong?
- <i>No.</i>

27:29.613 --> 27:31.646
But you said
you were gonna call me.

27:31.648 --> 27:33.582
And you didn't,
so I'm calling you.

27:33.584 --> 27:36.918
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I got busy, and I forgot.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.756
<i>Yeah, I just wanted you
to know I got home all right.</i>

27:40.758 --> 27:43.792
And-and I can see
you got home all right too.

27:43.794 --> 27:45.727
Yes, I did.

27:45.729 --> 27:46.831
<i>Yeah, good.</i>

27:47.998 --> 27:49.264
Good night.

27:49.266 --> 27:50.168
Good night.

27:59.143 --> 28:01.309
All right. Here's what
I think we should do:

28:01.311 --> 28:05.213
Start off with the California
Constitutional Right to Privacy.

28:05.215 --> 28:08.683
Then just move on to the common
law right against battery.

28:08.685 --> 28:10.451
<i>Cobbs v. Grant.</i>
That's important.

28:10.453 --> 28:12.654
That set the standard
for doctors' obligation

28:12.656 --> 28:15.690
to get informed consent
for intrusive procedures.

28:15.692 --> 28:19.061
We have to establish these
drugs are intrusive procedures.

28:19.063 --> 28:22.164
When the doctor first started
giving Eleanor Mellaril,

28:22.166 --> 28:24.900
he told her
she could take it four, six,

28:24.902 --> 28:27.202
- eight times a day if she wanted.
- Okay.

28:27.204 --> 28:30.206
He thought that it would help
psychologically. But it didn't.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.941
All it did was damage
her bladder and her brain,

28:32.943 --> 28:35.009
and make her seizures worse.

28:35.011 --> 28:36.812
And now she has
to keep taking it,

28:36.814 --> 28:39.915
- because if she doesn't, she has more seizures.
- My God.

28:39.917 --> 28:42.284
There's a notation
in her hospital records

28:42.286 --> 28:44.385
- that I'd like to highlight.
- Okay.

28:44.387 --> 28:47.523
"She was placed on Mellaril with
the reasoning that her bladder

28:47.525 --> 28:50.025
was already so damaged
that more or less

28:50.027 --> 28:53.328
Mellaril would not have
an impact on its recovery."

28:53.330 --> 28:55.264
So these people were
giving her drugs

28:55.266 --> 28:56.867
that they knew
were damaging her.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.170
Yeah.
I see it all the time.

29:00.371 --> 29:02.173
My God.

29:08.412 --> 29:11.913
This is for Mr. Adams.

29:11.915 --> 29:13.681
Good morning, Adams...

29:13.683 --> 29:14.882
That's her.

29:14.884 --> 29:17.186
Ms. Hughes?

29:17.188 --> 29:19.321
James Adams,
counsel for St. Mary's.

29:19.323 --> 29:20.689
Good to meet you,
Mr. Adams.

29:20.691 --> 29:22.857
I believe you already know
Dr. Booker.

29:22.859 --> 29:24.860
May I help you
with something?

29:24.862 --> 29:27.895
Yes. I stopped by
to deliver this.

29:27.897 --> 29:32.034
It's our response to your
briefing on the medications.

29:32.036 --> 29:33.701
It also includes
some information

29:33.703 --> 29:36.604
on the adverse side effects
of the medications in question,

29:36.606 --> 29:40.042
as well as the side effects
that they had on Ms. Riese.

29:40.044 --> 29:43.444
Off the record, how
did you reply so quickly?

29:43.446 --> 29:45.447
Who's your
medical expert?

29:45.449 --> 29:46.915
What do you mean?

29:46.917 --> 29:48.950
Who's coordinating on
the medical issues?

29:48.952 --> 29:50.352
I am.

29:50.354 --> 29:51.719
I don't understand.

29:51.721 --> 29:54.655
I was a nurse
for 10 years

29:54.657 --> 29:56.624
and a psychiatric nurse
for five.

29:56.626 --> 29:58.094
With a big firm
like yours,

29:58.096 --> 29:59.961
I assumed you'd do
a background check.

29:59.963 --> 30:01.896
I'm sure we did.
I must have missed it.

30:01.898 --> 30:04.266
You were a psychiatric nurse.
You're doing this?

30:04.268 --> 30:06.035
You're telling me
you were a nurse,

30:06.037 --> 30:09.270
you never gave drugs to patients
without their informed consent?

30:09.272 --> 30:12.641
No. Never.

30:12.643 --> 30:14.977
I always felt it
was my primary responsibility

30:14.979 --> 30:16.411
to care for the patient,

30:16.413 --> 30:19.715
not manage them
for my own convenience.

30:19.717 --> 30:21.352
Gentlemen.

31:02.492 --> 31:04.125
Hang on.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.796
- Hi.
- Oh.

31:07.798 --> 31:10.099
Look who's here,
it's my big-shot lawyer.

31:10.101 --> 31:11.633
Oh, nice to see you,
Sister.

31:11.635 --> 31:13.902
Hope I'm not
interrupting something.

31:13.904 --> 31:17.172
No, no. She's gotta go. She's
gotta go. Back to the convent.

31:17.174 --> 31:19.808
They treat her like
a sixth-grader. Bye!

31:19.810 --> 31:21.442
Yes, nice to see you
again, Colette.

31:21.444 --> 31:22.944
You too!

31:24.548 --> 31:26.315
You be careful
on those steps.

31:26.317 --> 31:27.882
I will.

31:27.884 --> 31:30.651
There's 25 of them.
And outside, there are two more.

31:30.653 --> 31:32.822
I know.
You've already told me.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.555
Yeah, there's 27.

31:34.557 --> 31:36.057
Twenty-seven steps.

31:36.059 --> 31:37.558
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.827
Bye.

31:41.565 --> 31:43.498
Sit down.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.167
Go on. Take a load off.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.669
I'll get you a 7UP.

31:46.671 --> 31:49.537
No, thank you.
I have someplace I have to be.

31:49.539 --> 31:52.641
Yeah, someplace
more important, I bet.

31:52.643 --> 31:54.142
O-okay.

31:57.181 --> 31:59.515
Yeah, isn't that
a beautiful bride?

31:59.517 --> 32:02.617
Yeah, I love weddings,
don't you?

32:02.619 --> 32:04.419
Thank you.
Not really.

32:08.692 --> 32:11.593
What about you and Robert?
You two getting married?

32:11.595 --> 32:14.529
Eleanor, I didn't come here
to talk about my personal life.

32:14.531 --> 32:16.798
Oh, so I'm right.
He is your boyfriend?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.933
Yeah, I'm right.
He's your boyfriend.

32:18.935 --> 32:21.670
The hospital called.
They have a request.

32:21.672 --> 32:24.773
Yeah, what do they want?
They want me to sing a song?

32:24.775 --> 32:26.542
No, I'm afraid not.

32:26.544 --> 32:29.143
They want you to appear
in Superior Court

32:29.145 --> 32:30.911
for the hearing
of the case.

32:32.583 --> 32:36.517
Do you mind if we just turn
the music down a little?

32:46.130 --> 32:48.898
So, uh, so would I
have to go up

32:48.900 --> 32:52.034
to the witness box
like <i>Perry Mason?</i>

32:52.036 --> 32:54.803
No, there... There
won't be a witness box.

32:54.805 --> 32:57.205
You would have to
sit in the courtroom

32:57.207 --> 32:59.140
and listen to what
the hospital's lawyer

32:59.142 --> 33:00.441
has to say about you.

33:00.443 --> 33:01.677
Uh-huh.

33:01.679 --> 33:04.779
Um. They want
to embarrass you.

33:04.781 --> 33:07.782
They're hoping that
you can't just sit there

33:07.784 --> 33:10.084
and listen to what they
have to say about you.

33:10.086 --> 33:12.988
They wanna try
and show the lawyer that

33:12.990 --> 33:15.990
you're not fit to make decisions
about your own medication.

33:15.992 --> 33:19.329
But it's just a request.
You don't have to do it.

33:25.736 --> 33:27.670
Here. You see this?

33:27.672 --> 33:32.106
This is where I write down
what medication I'm taking.

33:32.108 --> 33:37.045
The time I take it, how much
I take, and what it does to me.

33:37.047 --> 33:39.582
If I feel groggy
or it makes it hard for me

33:39.584 --> 33:41.583
to do the things I need
to do for myself.

33:41.585 --> 33:44.419
And then... And then
I tell a doctor. Yeah.

33:44.421 --> 33:48.123
And-and you see?
You know why I got all of those?

33:48.125 --> 33:50.526
And those?

33:50.528 --> 33:52.128
You know why?
Because I've been

33:52.130 --> 33:53.827
writing it down
for a lot of years.

33:53.829 --> 33:56.030
Nobody knows more about
what that medicine

33:56.032 --> 33:57.465
does to me than I do.

33:57.467 --> 33:59.767
Yeah.
Tell me I'm not right.

33:59.769 --> 34:02.237
Just-just tell me
I'm not right.

34:02.239 --> 34:03.471
You're right.

34:03.473 --> 34:05.907
Yeah, no,
I wanna go to court.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.547
This place
is beautiful.

34:13.550 --> 34:16.150
Yeah, I always wanted
to shop here.

34:16.152 --> 34:17.885
We only have
half an hour.

34:17.887 --> 34:21.556
Yeah, well, I'm not leaving
until I get exactly what I want.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.391
Can I see
a navy blue dress,

34:23.393 --> 34:25.827
navy blue shoes,
and navy blue pocketbook?

34:25.829 --> 34:27.362
You're in luck.

34:27.364 --> 34:31.199
We have an awful lot
of navy blue in your size.

34:31.201 --> 34:33.333
What did you
think of the last one?

34:33.335 --> 34:36.204
I told you I like it very much.
I think you should buy it.

34:36.206 --> 34:38.340
He's at Chope Community.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.541
No.

34:40.543 --> 34:42.244
Tell him I filed
the paperwork.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.746
Psst.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.179
You're not supposed to be
on the phone.

34:46.181 --> 34:47.916
You're supposed
to be helping me.

34:47.918 --> 34:52.123
Can you tell Mr. Hakamura
that I'll get back to him later?

34:53.023 --> 34:54.856
I put it down.

34:54.858 --> 34:56.925
I have to go.

34:56.927 --> 34:59.561
Well?
What do you think?

34:59.563 --> 35:01.130
It's fine.

35:01.132 --> 35:02.296
It's not fine.

35:02.298 --> 35:03.865
I look like
a balloon.

35:03.867 --> 35:06.334
I know this is important
to you, Eleanor,

35:06.336 --> 35:08.204
but I wanna get you
to the courthouse.

35:08.206 --> 35:10.204
Remember? I told you
we're on a schedule.

35:10.206 --> 35:12.874
I want you to see the room,
so that you're prepared.

35:12.876 --> 35:14.775
They close at 5.
It's almost 5 now.

35:14.777 --> 35:17.545
Yeah, well, I don't care.
I'm gonna look the way I want,

35:17.547 --> 35:19.648
whether you like it or not.
All right.

35:19.650 --> 35:23.251
Excuse me? Do you have
any other dresses in navy blue?

35:23.253 --> 35:24.786
In my size, please.

35:24.788 --> 35:26.755
- Let me see.
- Yeah, thank you.

35:26.757 --> 35:28.456
Yeah, you go to court
all the time.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.124
You probably
have lots of dresses.

35:30.126 --> 35:31.793
I don't.

35:31.795 --> 35:34.197
And don't look
at your watch.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.467
You see?

35:38.469 --> 35:39.670
This one's better?

35:40.905 --> 35:43.240
You're right. It is.

35:46.110 --> 35:48.709
Yeah, so now,
all I need to find now

35:48.711 --> 35:50.744
is shoes
and a pocketbook.

35:50.746 --> 35:52.179
But they have to be...

35:52.181 --> 35:54.016
The exact same shade
of navy blue.

35:54.018 --> 35:55.617
You're right.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.787
Yeah, this is it.

35:59.789 --> 36:01.289
That's it. Wow.

36:01.291 --> 36:02.960
Okay.

36:04.594 --> 36:05.693
Are you all right?

36:05.695 --> 36:07.697
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll be fine.

36:08.599 --> 36:10.264
One.

36:10.266 --> 36:11.633
Two.

36:11.635 --> 36:13.467
- Can I help you?
- Three... No.

36:13.469 --> 36:15.769
Four, five.

36:15.771 --> 36:18.106
Six, seven.

36:18.108 --> 36:21.846
Eight, nine, 10.

36:24.547 --> 36:27.014
All right.

36:27.016 --> 36:28.715
I'm sorry
there's not an elevator.

36:28.717 --> 36:30.552
Yeah, no, that's okay.

36:30.554 --> 36:34.224
No. I want everybody
to see my new dress.

36:40.797 --> 36:43.130
Eleven.

36:43.132 --> 36:44.766
Twelve.

36:44.768 --> 36:46.267
Thirteen.

36:46.269 --> 36:48.036
Fourteen.

36:48.038 --> 36:49.704
Fifteen.

36:49.706 --> 36:51.472
Sixteen.

36:51.474 --> 36:52.874
Seventeen.

36:52.876 --> 36:54.476
Eighteen.

36:54.478 --> 36:55.811
Nineteen.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.144
Twenty.

36:57.146 --> 37:00.248
Thirty-five, 36.

37:00.250 --> 37:02.851
Thirty-seven, 38.

37:02.853 --> 37:04.985
- Sure you're all right?
- Yeah, no.

37:04.987 --> 37:07.088
If you keep asking me
if I'm all right,

37:07.090 --> 37:10.124
I'm not gonna be all right,
all right?

37:10.126 --> 37:12.659
Forty-seven, 48.

37:12.661 --> 37:15.396
Forty-nine, 50.

37:15.398 --> 37:17.699
Fifty-one, 52.

37:17.701 --> 37:20.334
Fifty-three, 54.

37:20.336 --> 37:24.039
Fifty-five steps.

37:24.041 --> 37:26.874
- Hello, Mr. Cohen.
- Good morning.

37:26.876 --> 37:29.045
That's a beautiful dress.

37:29.947 --> 37:31.278
See?

37:31.280 --> 37:33.014
The question here,
Your Honor, is:

37:33.016 --> 37:35.684
Who is competent
to decide the medication

37:35.686 --> 37:38.052
of involuntary-held
short-term patients?

37:38.054 --> 37:41.222
Doctors,
who as the federal court ruled

37:41.224 --> 37:43.925
can be relied upon
to use professional judgment?

37:43.927 --> 37:47.262
Or chronic schizophrenic
mental patients?

37:47.264 --> 37:51.266
Like Eleanor Riese, who,
during her hospitalization,

37:51.268 --> 37:54.269
became delusional about
the medications, threw objects,

37:54.271 --> 37:56.104
and threatened nurses,

37:56.106 --> 37:59.907
defecated and urinated
on the floor,

37:59.909 --> 38:01.778
lying in her own wastes.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.148
These medications are
the only effective treatment

38:06.150 --> 38:08.150
for acute psychotic
patients.

38:08.152 --> 38:11.753
Yes, they can sometimes
have side effects, but most

38:11.755 --> 38:14.389
are temporary
and short-lived.

38:14.391 --> 38:18.025
According to the leading
authority on such medications,

38:18.027 --> 38:21.796
and I quote, "They're among
the safest drugs in medicine."

38:21.798 --> 38:24.800
Your Honor, would it not
defeat the very purpose

38:24.802 --> 38:26.769
for which hospitals
have been set up

38:26.771 --> 38:28.503
for doctors not
to be able to treat

38:28.505 --> 38:31.472
gravely disabled patients
like Eleanor Riese

38:31.474 --> 38:34.075
with the only medication
that would help them?

38:34.077 --> 38:35.479
Thank you,
Mr. Adams.

38:38.315 --> 38:41.349
With due respect, Your Honor,
I wish to rebut.

38:41.351 --> 38:45.153
"Competency"
is a legal term.

38:45.155 --> 38:46.820
It's not a medical term.

38:46.822 --> 38:49.758
Therefore, it is not
the doctor's right to determine.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.092
It is the court's.

38:51.094 --> 38:53.228
But the question is...

38:53.230 --> 38:55.929
The real question
is whether doctors...

38:55.931 --> 38:59.300
And not just doctors. Doctors,
nurses, hospital workers.

38:59.302 --> 39:01.869
Do these people routinely
have the right

39:01.871 --> 39:05.039
to override the choice
of a competent mental patient

39:05.041 --> 39:07.941
regarding
his or her medications?

39:07.943 --> 39:09.677
That is the real question.

39:09.679 --> 39:12.012
And I also take issue with
Mr. Adams' portrayal

39:12.014 --> 39:14.849
of these drugs
being a panacea

39:14.851 --> 39:16.452
for patients
with schizophrenia.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.320
Studies show
that they are effective,

39:18.322 --> 39:21.255
but they are effective at only
one-third of the cases.

39:21.257 --> 39:23.425
And the hospital's
own records show

39:23.427 --> 39:26.526
that these drugs have not
always helped Ms. Riese.

39:26.528 --> 39:29.363
And by the way, the hospital
records also contradict

39:29.365 --> 39:32.633
Mr. Adams' characterization
of Ms. Riese's behavior.

39:32.635 --> 39:36.338
While there, not only was she
locked in a seclusion room...

39:36.340 --> 39:37.873
Mr. Cohen.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.807
I have read the record.

39:39.809 --> 39:42.411
She was given drugs
that made her

39:42.413 --> 39:44.845
agitated and sleepy
at the same time.

39:44.847 --> 39:46.280
And these people,
Your Honor,

39:46.282 --> 39:48.182
they didn't let her
go to the bathroom.

39:48.184 --> 39:51.353
So, yes, she urinated
and defecated all over herself.

39:51.355 --> 39:53.354
And as for her
threatening the nurses?

39:53.356 --> 39:55.289
They were forcing
medications on her.

39:55.291 --> 39:57.858
Which is what
this case is about.

39:57.860 --> 40:00.729
And, yes, she threw...
And I want to be specific here...

40:00.731 --> 40:02.863
She threw
a plastic pitcher of water...

40:02.865 --> 40:04.166
Mr. Cohen.

40:04.168 --> 40:07.235
Gentlemen.
The briefing is heavy

40:07.237 --> 40:10.070
and adequate
and very well-done.

40:10.072 --> 40:12.673
And that is the reason
I'm cutting you off somewhat

40:12.675 --> 40:14.075
in the oral argument.

40:14.077 --> 40:16.010
Your Honor,
I will shorten my argument,

40:16.012 --> 40:18.347
but these are
fundamental legal rights.

40:18.349 --> 40:21.385
- In <i>Cobbs v. Grant...</i>
- Mr. Cohen.

40:25.588 --> 40:28.555
Reviewing the file,
I do not find anything

40:28.557 --> 40:31.559
constitutionally
objectionable

40:31.561 --> 40:34.362
in the forcible treatment

40:34.364 --> 40:38.233
of short-term involuntary
mental patients.

40:38.235 --> 40:41.735
And I am not prepared
to make a decision

40:41.737 --> 40:45.641
granting a constitutional
challenge to the position.

40:45.643 --> 40:48.144
- Your Honor...
- Mr. Cohen, as I have said

40:49.713 --> 40:53.213
I am not prepared
to change the decision.

40:53.215 --> 40:54.916
- All right.
- Excellent.

40:54.918 --> 40:56.751
He didn't wanna hear
this case.

40:56.753 --> 40:58.586
It was over
before we started.

40:58.588 --> 41:00.021
Thank you so much.

41:00.023 --> 41:01.991
- Told you.
- That was very good.

41:05.262 --> 41:07.628
What do you have
to smile about?

41:07.630 --> 41:10.264
- Pardon me?
- No, you got a terrible job.

41:10.266 --> 41:12.601
- All right. Let's go.
- Yeah, coming to court

41:12.603 --> 41:14.601
- and lying about people.
- Eleanor.

41:14.603 --> 41:17.604
And telling the judge
it's-it's okay

41:17.606 --> 41:20.041
- for doctors to throw patients...
- Eleanor.

41:20.043 --> 41:24.246
...on the floor and inject them
with whatever they like?

41:24.248 --> 41:26.246
- Yeah, I feel sorry.
- All right.

41:26.248 --> 41:29.152
- I feel sorry for you.
- Here we go.

41:34.291 --> 41:36.657
What good is a judge who...?

41:36.659 --> 41:38.925
Who can't make
a decision?

41:38.927 --> 41:40.829
I mean,
it's an easy case.

41:40.831 --> 41:43.498
- I'm sorry, Eleanor.
- Why didn't you tell him off?

41:43.500 --> 41:45.166
Why didn't Mr. Cohen
tell him off?

41:45.168 --> 41:47.501
Why didn't you tell the judge
that he's stupid?

41:47.503 --> 41:49.771
Because you can't tell
a judge they're stupid.

41:49.773 --> 41:53.474
I have better things to do
with my day than waste it here.

41:53.476 --> 41:57.646
Yeah, I could have been at home,
making rosaries.

41:57.648 --> 41:59.914
Yeah, people
all over the world,

41:59.916 --> 42:02.117
they're waiting for
my rosaries.

42:04.288 --> 42:06.487
No. No, I-I...

42:06.489 --> 42:09.289
I had to sit in court

42:09.291 --> 42:12.994
while my bladder hurts,
and I had to urinate.

42:12.996 --> 42:15.063
That's all because
of those drugs

42:15.065 --> 42:17.130
that the hospital
say are so good for me.

42:17.132 --> 42:19.867
Well, if they're so good,
then why do I have to use this

42:19.869 --> 42:23.137
every time I go to the bathroom
for the rest of my life?

42:23.139 --> 42:24.604
And how come...?

42:24.606 --> 42:27.342
How come they get
to throw me down

42:27.344 --> 42:30.445
and pull down my underpants
and stick needles into me?

42:30.447 --> 42:32.516
Yeah, if I did that,
I'll go to jail.

42:33.949 --> 42:35.916
Tell me I'm not right.

42:39.322 --> 42:41.523
It's not over, Eleanor.

42:41.525 --> 42:43.023
We're not giving up.

42:43.025 --> 42:46.360
We're going to file
for an appeal.

43:03.514 --> 43:04.949
How is she?

43:11.121 --> 43:14.088
Yeah, park here.
Here. This is good.

43:14.090 --> 43:15.492
Thank you.

43:16.393 --> 43:17.791
Yeah, you know,

43:17.793 --> 43:20.193
I don't just give
my rosaries to people.

43:20.195 --> 43:22.563
I give them to my church,

43:22.565 --> 43:24.934
and they send them
to different countries.

43:26.536 --> 43:31.171
And I use them to pray
for all the people on my list.

43:31.173 --> 43:34.708
You're on my list.
So is Mr. Cohen.

43:34.710 --> 43:37.912
- Yeah, you're number eight.
- Thank you.

43:37.914 --> 43:41.583
My mother, she's number one.
She's been very sick.

43:41.585 --> 43:44.855
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Eleanor.

43:52.295 --> 43:53.896
You wanna come in
and meet her?

43:58.902 --> 44:00.003
I'd love to.

44:03.739 --> 44:07.909
You may not know this
about Eleanor,

44:07.911 --> 44:12.246
but she graduated high school
when she was 18 years of age

44:12.248 --> 44:14.782
with the rest of her class,

44:14.784 --> 44:19.320
even though people
always said she couldn't.

44:19.322 --> 44:21.523
And she's been living alone

44:21.525 --> 44:23.925
for years.

44:23.927 --> 44:28.229
She could have kept living
with me here, of course,

44:28.231 --> 44:30.831
- but she didn't want to.
- I told you.

44:30.833 --> 44:33.901
I don't like the weather
in this part of town.

44:33.903 --> 44:35.903
You know that.

44:35.905 --> 44:38.305
Yeah, it's never sunny.

44:38.307 --> 44:40.675
No, at like...
In the mornings,

44:40.677 --> 44:42.943
my living room
is full of light.

44:42.945 --> 44:45.880
- Isn't that true, Colette?
- Yeah. Yep, it is.

44:45.882 --> 44:48.950
Yeah, she's a nice person.
She is.

44:48.952 --> 44:50.885
And she's a good lawyer.

44:50.887 --> 44:54.091
Yeah, even if she did
lose today.

44:56.659 --> 44:58.758
That was a joke, Colette.

45:00.130 --> 45:02.863
Even if it is true.

45:11.307 --> 45:15.510
Honey, it's almost 2.
How about coming to bed?

45:15.512 --> 45:17.047
I can't.

45:19.016 --> 45:21.081
You can't keep pushing yourself
like this.

45:21.083 --> 45:23.721
If I don't do it,
it won't get done.

46:01.724 --> 46:03.356
One.

46:03.358 --> 46:05.927
Two. Three.

46:05.929 --> 46:09.764
I'll be there for your hearing
tomorrow at 3, Mrs. Hayes. Yes.

46:09.766 --> 46:11.566
I will. No, I...

46:11.568 --> 46:13.434
I will.

46:13.436 --> 46:17.007
Okay, at 3 p.m.
tomorrow. Bye.

46:21.811 --> 46:24.479
- Hi.
- Eleanor.

46:24.481 --> 46:26.882
You didn't have to come
all the way to my place.

46:26.884 --> 46:28.717
I'd have been happy
to stop at yours.

46:28.719 --> 46:29.950
That's okay.

46:29.952 --> 46:32.789
I wanted to see
where you live.

46:34.523 --> 46:38.860
Here. Let me get the page
for you to review and sign,

46:38.862 --> 46:40.961
so we can file the appeal.

46:40.963 --> 46:42.963
Um, here, sit down. I'll...

46:42.965 --> 46:44.734
I'll get you a pen.

46:46.635 --> 46:49.137
Those shoes
are too big for you.

46:49.139 --> 46:51.171
- Are they Robert's?
- Yes.

46:51.173 --> 46:53.641
So you do have a boyfriend.

46:53.643 --> 46:54.545
Yes.

47:02.753 --> 47:06.320
- Does he sleep here with you?
- Eleanor.

47:06.322 --> 47:08.255
Yeah.
I've never had a boyfriend.

47:08.257 --> 47:09.990
- Yeah, I'm too shy.
- Here.

47:09.992 --> 47:12.258
I have this page
right here for you to sign.

47:12.260 --> 47:14.494
Yeah,
I'm not signing anything

47:14.496 --> 47:17.432
until you read it
and explain it to me.

47:17.434 --> 47:19.700
Explain what happened to you
at St. Mary's?

47:19.702 --> 47:22.369
It's the same thing we described
in your declaration...

47:22.371 --> 47:25.873
No, I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about the rest.

47:25.875 --> 47:27.508
Like all of this.

47:27.510 --> 47:30.978
<i>Cobbs v. Grant,
Bouvia v. Superior Court.</i>

47:30.980 --> 47:33.581
Everything. Read it.

47:33.583 --> 47:35.619
Yeah, and don't look
at your watch.

47:39.688 --> 47:41.688
Here, this lists the cases
we're citing.

47:41.690 --> 47:43.958
This is <i>Bouvia
v. Supreme Court.</i>

47:43.960 --> 47:46.526
It says that in California,
people have the right

47:46.528 --> 47:49.296
to refuse medical treatment,
but it's never been applied

47:49.298 --> 47:51.032
to people
with mental disabilities.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.499
- So...
- Wait a minute.

47:52.501 --> 47:57.037
I need to get my pad,
so I can make notes.

47:57.039 --> 48:00.809
<i>Why are you taking this
case to the State Court of Appeal?</i>

48:00.811 --> 48:04.144
Because I believe what happened
to Eleanor Riese

48:04.146 --> 48:05.813
was a form of chemical rape.

48:05.815 --> 48:07.815
That's kind of strong,
don't you think?

48:07.817 --> 48:09.050
Not in my opinion.

48:09.052 --> 48:10.851
Look at the force they used

48:10.853 --> 48:12.887
to administer the drugs
to her.

48:12.889 --> 48:14.956
Look what the drugs
did to her.

48:14.958 --> 48:17.191
What is that
if not a form of rape?

48:17.193 --> 48:19.860
So more mental patients
should be released?

48:19.862 --> 48:22.063
Aren't there too many
on the street already?

48:22.065 --> 48:24.831
The last thing we want
is more people on the streets.

48:24.833 --> 48:28.503
<i>We want people to get the
services they need and want.</i>

48:28.505 --> 48:30.572
- Mm-hm.
- <i>When people are in the hospital</i>

48:30.574 --> 48:33.441
<i>let's have the doctor do
the doctor's job:</i>

48:33.443 --> 48:36.644
<i>explaining the medications,
possible risks and benefits,</i>

48:36.646 --> 48:38.345
and have
the competent patient

48:38.347 --> 48:40.148
do the patient's job
of choosing.

48:40.150 --> 48:41.916
But isn't that an oxymoron?

48:41.918 --> 48:45.186
How can someone who's
considered mentally disabled

48:45.188 --> 48:47.387
be competent enough
to make decisions?

48:47.389 --> 48:51.191
Mental illness does not affect
all areas of functioning.

48:51.193 --> 48:53.961
<i>There are many people
with mental illnesses</i>

48:53.963 --> 48:55.429
<i>who are highly competent</i>

48:55.431 --> 48:57.898
<i>in areas
not affected by their illness.</i>

48:57.900 --> 49:01.436
<i>Look at Eleanor Riese.
She didn't refuse medication.</i>

49:01.438 --> 49:03.537
<i>She refused
too much medication.</i>

49:03.539 --> 49:06.007
<i>A sign of her competency
to understand</i>

49:06.009 --> 49:08.608
<i>the medications'
side effects.</i>

49:08.610 --> 49:10.411
<i>In every other branch
of medicine,</i>

49:10.413 --> 49:12.947
unless a patient is in a coma

49:12.949 --> 49:16.751
or experiencing
a life-threatening emergency

49:16.753 --> 49:19.086
and is incapable
of voicing a decision,

49:19.088 --> 49:22.655
<i>it's always the patient
who makes the decision.</i>

49:22.657 --> 49:25.892
<i>Only in a mental hospital is it
always the doctor's choice.</i>

49:25.894 --> 49:27.894
<i>And if the patient refuses,</i>

49:27.896 --> 49:31.898
<i>violence is used
to enforce the doctor's choice,</i>

49:31.900 --> 49:34.270
as it was on Eleanor Riese.

49:35.972 --> 49:38.608
You're famous, dear.

49:39.742 --> 49:41.742
Yeah.

49:41.744 --> 49:45.612
Yeah, I'm representing
150,000 people.

49:45.614 --> 49:47.816
Yeah,
I'm gonna be as important

49:47.818 --> 49:52.022
as <i>Bouvia v. Superior Court</i>
and <i>Cobbs v. Grant.</i>

49:55.925 --> 49:58.695
Oh, that's nice.

50:02.697 --> 50:04.432
- Happy birthday.
- Okay.

50:04.434 --> 50:06.601
Oh, happy birthday.

50:06.603 --> 50:09.135
One good thing
about my case taking so long is

50:09.137 --> 50:11.271
I have birthday parties
with my lawyers.

50:11.273 --> 50:12.639
- Yeah.
- Just a little bit?

50:12.641 --> 50:14.675
And one of them
brought me flowers.

50:14.677 --> 50:16.844
Well, it's
my pleasure.

50:16.846 --> 50:21.481
And I get to speak properly
to Colette's boyfriend.

50:21.483 --> 50:24.651
Yeah, so Colette tells me
you're a doctor.

50:24.653 --> 50:26.820
- Yeah.
- How come you're not against us?

50:26.822 --> 50:28.555
Because I think
you're right.

50:28.557 --> 50:32.860
Ah! Yeah, he...
You must be pretty smart.

50:32.862 --> 50:35.496
Yeah, I wouldn't let
this guy get away.

50:35.498 --> 50:37.664
And you're not
getting any younger.

50:37.666 --> 50:39.032
Eleanor.

50:39.034 --> 50:41.034
It's nice to have
one doctor on our side.

50:41.036 --> 50:42.168
Yeah.

50:42.170 --> 50:44.104
Yeah. Oh!

50:44.106 --> 50:45.338
You know what?

50:45.340 --> 50:47.441
I'm gonna
have this with

50:47.443 --> 50:50.110
Colette's birthday present
for me.

50:50.112 --> 50:53.382
Dreyer's vanilla ice cream.
It's my favorite.

50:55.717 --> 50:58.753
- Everybody else can have some.
- I like ice cream.

50:58.755 --> 51:02.389
It goes so well
with wine and cake.

51:02.391 --> 51:04.825
- You want some?
- Mom, do you want some?

51:04.827 --> 51:06.528
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

51:06.530 --> 51:08.429
Eleanor,

51:08.431 --> 51:11.668
- I have a present for you too.
- For me?

51:12.969 --> 51:15.202
Thank you, Robert.

51:15.204 --> 51:18.204
- Thank you. That's sweet of you.
- You're welcome.

51:18.206 --> 51:19.909
I'm excited.

51:28.684 --> 51:30.684
It's the McGuire Sisters.

51:30.686 --> 51:34.088
- Oh, nice.
- How'd you know?

51:34.090 --> 51:36.624
Oh, I love it.
I love it, I love it.

51:36.626 --> 51:39.226
Thank you. Thank you, Robert.

51:39.228 --> 51:40.894
- Yeah, look.
- Oh, I see.

51:40.896 --> 51:42.664
I haven't got this one.

51:42.666 --> 51:44.664
- Oh, lovely.
- See, Mama?

51:44.666 --> 51:46.867
Ah, I'm gonna put it on
right now.

51:46.869 --> 51:48.568
Ooh!

51:48.570 --> 51:51.104
- Dear. Oh, gosh.
- You got the springs.

51:51.106 --> 51:52.706
- Move on.
- I forgot.

51:52.708 --> 51:54.575
You always forget.
You know what?

51:54.577 --> 51:56.242
When we win this case,

51:56.244 --> 51:58.445
there will be
shopping trips to the Emporium

51:58.447 --> 52:00.947
because I could really use
a new sofa.

52:00.949 --> 52:03.249
Yeah, okay.

52:03.251 --> 52:04.885
All right.

52:04.887 --> 52:06.856
Thank you, Robert.

52:50.833 --> 52:54.735
You know what?
This song is so romantic.

52:54.737 --> 52:56.771
Do you two wanna dance?

53:10.853 --> 53:13.220
Okay, now it's your turn.

53:14.824 --> 53:16.090
Your turn. Your turn.

53:16.092 --> 53:17.925
- Oh, no, not me.
- Yes, you.

53:17.927 --> 53:20.628
- No, no. I'm not. I don't dance.
- Yes, you.

53:20.630 --> 53:22.662
I can't.

53:22.664 --> 53:25.335
Come on. Come on.

53:26.668 --> 53:29.239
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

53:31.407 --> 53:33.009
All right.

53:34.876 --> 53:37.679
- Put your hand here.
- All right.

54:01.871 --> 54:04.871
I wanna include
a First Amendment argument

54:04.873 --> 54:06.340
about these drugs interfering

54:06.342 --> 54:08.342
with a person's freedom
of speech.

54:08.344 --> 54:09.876
Mm-mm.
That's not a good idea.

54:09.878 --> 54:12.579
No one who speaks
to people in mental hospitals

54:12.581 --> 54:14.782
can't say these drugs
aren't interfering

54:14.784 --> 54:17.016
with their personality,
their thoughts,

54:17.018 --> 54:20.021
- emotions, expressions.
- Okay, here's what I've done.

54:20.023 --> 54:23.057
I have put in the California
Constitutional Right to Privacy,

54:23.059 --> 54:25.425
but with the hospital's
new reply brief,

54:25.427 --> 54:27.595
we have a lot to answer.
I think we're fine.

54:27.597 --> 54:30.097
St. Mary's
wrote in Eleanor's record

54:30.099 --> 54:33.534
that they medicated her
for being sarcastic.

54:33.536 --> 54:35.068
If that isn't interfering

54:35.070 --> 54:37.972
with her freedom of speech,
what is it?

54:37.974 --> 54:41.641
Anytime anyone has put in
a First Amendment argument

54:41.643 --> 54:44.612
in a case like this,
they've lost.

54:44.614 --> 54:45.949
No, it's too risky.

54:47.782 --> 54:51.251
Let's go to work.
We have 50 pages.

54:59.594 --> 55:01.362
Oh, no.

55:01.364 --> 55:03.597
<i>I don't want it! No,
I don't want to go in there.</i>

55:03.599 --> 55:05.231
<i>I don't want to go in there!</i>

55:05.233 --> 55:07.934
You're giving me too much!
Too much!

55:07.936 --> 55:10.604
<i>Too much. You know that.</i>

55:23.552 --> 55:25.355
It's the phone.

55:27.389 --> 55:29.456
- Hello?
- <i>I need you.</i>

55:29.458 --> 55:32.391
<i>I need you! Please come!</i>

55:53.648 --> 55:54.784
Eleanor.

56:00.456 --> 56:02.255
I'm here now.

56:02.257 --> 56:05.626
Yeah. I feel like
I'm being spanked.

56:05.628 --> 56:08.528
- Yeah, I'm being spanked.
- But no...

56:08.530 --> 56:10.563
You're a nurse and a lawyer.

56:10.565 --> 56:12.900
- Why can't you stop it?
- Nobody's spanking you.

56:12.902 --> 56:16.170
No. Yeah. No.

56:16.172 --> 56:19.305
- No, I know.
- Are you in pain?

56:19.307 --> 56:22.476
- Yeah.
- Okay.

56:22.478 --> 56:25.378
- I'm... I'm scared.
- Okay.

56:25.380 --> 56:27.347
- I'm scared.
- What are you scared of?

56:27.349 --> 56:30.150
- I'm scared...
- What are you scared of?

56:30.152 --> 56:31.820
I'm scared of...

56:32.855 --> 56:34.822
I'm scared of dying.

56:34.824 --> 56:37.124
I'm scared of dying.

56:37.126 --> 56:39.360
- What if I haven't been good enough?
- No.

56:39.362 --> 56:41.996
What if I don't go to heaven?

56:41.998 --> 56:44.264
- You're not dying.
- I don't get into heaven.

56:44.266 --> 56:47.200
You're not dying,
and you're a very good girl.

56:47.202 --> 56:49.836
- I don't know.
- Shh.

56:49.838 --> 56:53.173
Can you take a breath? Shh.

56:53.175 --> 56:56.043
Okay, now talk to me.
Talk to me.

56:56.045 --> 56:58.811
- What?
- Can you

56:58.813 --> 57:00.746
tell me why you think
you're dying?

57:00.748 --> 57:02.849
My stomach.

57:02.851 --> 57:05.985
- Okay.
- My... My stomach hurts.

57:05.987 --> 57:07.720
It hurts so much.

57:07.722 --> 57:09.889
Would you like me
to make an appointment

57:09.891 --> 57:11.594
for you to see
a new urologist?

57:13.128 --> 57:15.695
Well, yeah, I...

57:15.697 --> 57:17.630
If... If you'd come with me?

57:17.632 --> 57:19.599
Yes. Of course
I'll come with you.

57:19.601 --> 57:22.802
- I'm sorry, I get scared.
- Okay.

57:22.804 --> 57:25.838
It's all right.
It's all right. No.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.543
It's all right.

57:33.715 --> 57:37.050
When I was in
Catholic school,

57:37.052 --> 57:40.420
around fifth grade,
the teachers,

57:40.422 --> 57:42.923
they hit me.

57:42.925 --> 57:45.258
And then,

57:45.260 --> 57:48.765
some of the kids,
they said...

57:50.331 --> 57:54.501
that my seizures were
the work of the devil.

57:54.503 --> 57:56.570
Like...

57:56.572 --> 57:58.675
I was bad.

58:00.809 --> 58:03.577
You don't think my seizures
are the work of the devil?

58:03.579 --> 58:06.146
No. Absolutely not.

58:06.148 --> 58:10.050
You have seizures because you
have a damaged nervous system.

58:10.052 --> 58:13.987
It's not because
of anything you've done.

58:13.989 --> 58:17.559
Eleanor, you're
a very good person.

58:18.793 --> 58:21.829
A very, very good person.

58:21.831 --> 58:23.466
Thank you.

58:50.827 --> 58:53.059
Divine master,

58:53.061 --> 58:56.396
grant that I may not so much
seek to be consoled

58:56.398 --> 58:58.699
as to console.

58:58.701 --> 59:03.103
To be understood,
as to understand.

59:03.105 --> 59:06.273
To be loved, as to love.

59:06.275 --> 59:09.175
For it is in the giving

59:09.177 --> 59:11.043
that we receive.

59:11.045 --> 59:14.847
And it is in the pardoning
that we are pardoned.

59:14.849 --> 59:18.985
And it is in the dying

59:18.987 --> 59:21.890
that we are born
to eternal life.

59:23.358 --> 59:24.760
Amen.

59:26.594 --> 59:30.162
You put the First Amendment
argument in for five pages.

59:30.164 --> 59:32.999
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing that?

59:33.001 --> 59:35.536
I didn't see the point
of talking about it anymore.

59:35.538 --> 59:37.503
I'm sorry?

59:37.505 --> 59:39.171
What did you say?

59:39.173 --> 59:41.675
I didn't see the point
of talking about it anymore.

59:41.677 --> 59:42.845
Uh-huh.

59:45.380 --> 59:46.749
This is teamwork.

59:47.682 --> 59:49.385
We're a team.

59:53.755 --> 59:55.923
Would you tell
the court, Mr. Cohen,

59:55.925 --> 59:58.090
how you respond to
the hospital's statement

59:58.092 --> 01:00:01.829
that these drugs are among
the safest known to medicine?

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:03.863
Yes, Your Honor,
I'd be happy to.

01:00:03.865 --> 01:00:07.200
The side effects of these drugs,
according to Gaughan and...

01:00:07.202 --> 01:00:09.403
LaRue.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.871
- And who? LaRue?
- Mm.

01:00:11.873 --> 01:00:14.541
The side effects of these drugs,
according to Gaughan

01:00:14.543 --> 01:00:18.411
and LaRue are as varied
and serious as any...

01:00:18.413 --> 01:00:19.947
pharmaceuticals

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.048
being manufactured
in the United States today.

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:25.119
What specifically are
the side effects, Mr. Cohen?

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.952
I have no idea, Your Honor.

01:00:26.954 --> 01:00:30.322
- Neuroleptic malignant...
- Neuroleptic malignant...

01:00:30.324 --> 01:00:33.059
- syndrome.
- Start with tardive dyskinesia.

01:00:33.061 --> 01:00:36.396
Let me get neuroleptic
malignant syndrome first.

01:00:36.398 --> 01:00:38.465
Neuroleptic malignant...

01:00:38.467 --> 01:00:40.934
You've been around
this language. I haven't.

01:00:40.936 --> 01:00:43.771
All right? So take it easy.

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.972
You told me to train you
like a boxer.

01:00:45.974 --> 01:00:49.108
I did, but you don't have to
strangle me with the ropes.

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:51.177
You have to know
this stuff cold.

01:00:51.179 --> 01:00:53.412
Oh, I have
to know this cold.

01:00:53.414 --> 01:00:55.682
You know, you're not the only
one who cares about this.

01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:56.619
I care about this.

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:09.396
Why is tardive dyskinesia
so significant?

01:01:09.398 --> 01:01:11.034
Because it is.

01:01:18.106 --> 01:01:21.708
Recent literature shows
that tardive dyskinesia

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.278
has a prevalence rate
of up to 50 percent

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.983
in patients who are using
these drugs. Next question.

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:45.032
Are you made up for the circus
or Court of Appeal?

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:47.800
- Aren't you coming?
- Oh, no. I can't.

01:01:47.802 --> 01:01:50.137
I'm... I'm too tired.

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.737
I didn't sleep well
last night.

01:01:51.739 --> 01:01:53.574
If you knew
you weren't coming,

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:56.209
why didn't you call me
and let me know?

01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.947
I wanted to wish you luck.

01:02:02.851 --> 01:02:04.351
I'm sorry.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.787
You... You said I didn't
have to be there,

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:09.289
so why are you so upset?

01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:11.891
I guess I'm just
a little nervous.

01:02:11.893 --> 01:02:15.963
I know you and Mr. Cohen
are gonna win this time.

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:17.664
I hope so.

01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:21.703
Yeah, you are. 'Cause
you're gonna do your best.

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:33.412
The hospital contends

01:02:33.414 --> 01:02:35.282
that the side effects
of these drugs,

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.316
such as tardive dyskinesia

01:02:37.318 --> 01:02:40.487
are not at issue in this case
because the treatment period

01:02:40.489 --> 01:02:44.258
for short-term
involuntary patients is just...

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:48.028
...three to 17 days.
Would you address this?

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.831
I would be happy to address
that, Your Honor.

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.566
And they certainly
are an issue. Ahem.

01:02:53.568 --> 01:02:56.769
As Dr. Harvey Dondershine
of Stanford Medical School

01:02:56.771 --> 01:03:00.474
has said, it is the cumulative
effect of these drugs

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:03.242
to which patients
like Ms. Eleanor Riese

01:03:03.244 --> 01:03:07.447
are repeatedly exposed during
numerous short-term admissions

01:03:07.449 --> 01:03:10.450
that make each dose so dangerous
because no doctor can tell

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:13.387
when even the smallest dose

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:16.724
can send a patient
like Ms. Eleanor Riese

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:18.391
over the edge.

01:03:18.393 --> 01:03:21.927
Recent literature has shown
that tardive dyskinesia

01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:24.831
has a prevalence rate
of up to 50 percent.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:28.434
Fifty percent, Your Honor,
in patients who use these drugs.

01:03:28.436 --> 01:03:30.436
And it's a devastating disease.

01:03:30.438 --> 01:03:33.273
It causes facial distortions.

01:03:33.275 --> 01:03:35.976
It causes involuntary
movement of the tongue

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:37.476
and the lips and the jaw.

01:03:37.478 --> 01:03:39.979
But it's worse
than that, Your Honor.

01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:42.548
It affects your breathing.
You can't...

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:43.550
You can't breathe.

01:03:43.552 --> 01:03:45.385
It puts you on a respirator.

01:03:45.387 --> 01:03:48.488
It makes your tongue hang
so far out of your mouth

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:50.324
that sometimes
they pull your teeth,

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:53.961
so you won't
bite your tongue off.

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:57.030
And it's not only tardive
dyskinesia, Your Honor.

01:03:57.032 --> 01:04:01.034
These drugs can cause
neuroleptic...

01:04:01.036 --> 01:04:05.037
- <i>Malignant syndrome.</i>
- <i>...malignant syndrome.</i>

01:04:05.039 --> 01:04:06.175
It kills you.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:14.179
Yes, the issue of consent
is important, Your Honor.

01:04:14.181 --> 01:04:16.950
Are you asking
for informed consent

01:04:16.952 --> 01:04:18.485
in the case of emergencies?

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.954
No. No. Obviously,
in the case of an emergency

01:04:20.956 --> 01:04:22.421
immediate care is needed,

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:25.191
so patients
won't harm themselves or others.

01:04:25.193 --> 01:04:27.561
No. We're not asking
for informed consent.

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:29.630
But for acute patients,
who are competent

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:31.365
yes, we are seeking the right

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.666
to have a dialogue with
their physicians

01:04:33.668 --> 01:04:36.536
about medication,
about the right of choice.

01:04:36.538 --> 01:04:38.871
This is not about refusal.

01:04:38.873 --> 01:04:41.807
This... This is
about the right to refuse.

01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:43.809
And in that right,
there's a negotiation.

01:04:43.811 --> 01:04:46.278
There's a communication between
doctor and patient

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.880
that does not exist today.

01:04:47.882 --> 01:04:51.316
We are asking that the physician
inform their patients

01:04:51.318 --> 01:04:53.820
about the medication,
which in most cases

01:04:53.822 --> 01:04:55.892
the patients are going
to accept. Why?

01:04:57.726 --> 01:04:59.525
They wanna get better.

01:04:59.527 --> 01:05:01.427
They wanna be helped.

01:05:01.429 --> 01:05:05.898
So this will help doctors
better perform

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.900
their true role...

01:05:07.902 --> 01:05:10.070
as healers.

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.871
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:13.241
Thank you.

01:05:16.311 --> 01:05:19.479
- How'd it go?
- Better than Superior Court.

01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:22.548
Uh-huh.
- Much, much better.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:26.186
I know there are 27 steps,
but you don't look so good.

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:27.454
You should sit down.

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:29.088
- No.
- I'll give you a 7UP.

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.258
- I'm okay, thank you.
- Hello, Robert.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.559
- Hi.
- Were you there this morning?

01:05:33.561 --> 01:05:35.360
Yeah, the argument
went very well.

01:05:35.362 --> 01:05:38.264
I wish I had heard Mr. Cohen
arguing with the judge.

01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:39.932
I bet he really yelled at him.

01:05:39.934 --> 01:05:42.302
He doesn't really
argue with him.

01:05:42.304 --> 01:05:43.771
That's just what they call it

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.905
when you speak in court,
"oral argument."

01:05:45.907 --> 01:05:48.742
Oh, well, I bet
he was good anyway.

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:51.344
Now we only have
to wait for their decision.

01:05:51.346 --> 01:05:53.012
Yeah, I've been thinking:

01:05:53.014 --> 01:05:55.416
When we win, there's gonna
be a shopping trip

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:58.954
to the Emporium because I really
need to fix this place up.

01:06:00.889 --> 01:06:03.789
What's that on your face?

01:06:03.791 --> 01:06:05.793
Nothing. Is this for me?

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.630
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:14.971
Are you ready?

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:18.539
I can't believe it.

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:21.206
The hospital's saying the
mental-health statutes are...

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:23.644
I don't want to hear
about mental-health statutes.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.077
I want you to rest.

01:06:25.079 --> 01:06:26.545
Court won't give us
a decision

01:06:26.547 --> 01:06:28.748
until we turn in
this supplementary briefing.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.583
- It's my job.
- I'm a doctor,

01:06:30.585 --> 01:06:32.452
and I've told you
how serious this is.

01:06:32.454 --> 01:06:35.021
Your doctor has
told you how serious it is.

01:06:35.023 --> 01:06:37.356
You know you can die
from shingles.

01:06:37.358 --> 01:06:40.293
Rarely. Rarely
do people die from...

01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:42.595
Rarely do people have it
as badly as you do

01:06:42.597 --> 01:06:45.134
and ignore
what everybody tells them!

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.969
I admire your commitment,
Colette,

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:51.104
but you're not
indestructible.

01:06:51.106 --> 01:06:53.106
You have to tell Mort
how sick you are.

01:06:53.108 --> 01:06:54.941
You can't keep pretending
you're not.

01:06:54.943 --> 01:06:57.113
You need to rest.

01:06:59.146 --> 01:07:01.981
Hi, Eleanor. I don't know
what to do for her.

01:07:01.983 --> 01:07:04.220
She just won't listen.

01:07:09.557 --> 01:07:11.559
Yeah, you look lousy.

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.028
I brought you
some chicken soup.

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.532
Thank you.

01:07:19.768 --> 01:07:23.436
And I came here to bring you
a new rosary I just made

01:07:23.438 --> 01:07:26.005
but you don't deserve it
because you're not resting.

01:07:26.007 --> 01:07:28.273
I am resting.
I'm not at the office.

01:07:28.275 --> 01:07:30.644
No, I heard
what Robert said.

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:33.378
He said you
shouldn't be working at all.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:37.083
Okay, he's a doctor, but
doesn't mean he's not right.

01:07:37.085 --> 01:07:38.650
I'm okay.

01:07:38.652 --> 01:07:41.588
I know what it's like
to be sick, Colette.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:44.324
I don't want you ever
to be sick.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:48.164
- I just want you to get better.
- I'm gonna rest, I promise.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.233
I'm gonna pray for you.

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:58.606
- Thank you, Eleanor.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:39.478
<i>Hello. This is Eleanor Riese.</i>

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:44.082
<i>722-3529.</i>

01:08:44.085 --> 01:08:46.452
<i>I just want to make sure
you don't forget</i>

01:08:46.453 --> 01:08:48.321
<i>to have your chicken soup.</i>

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:50.423
<i>I'm doing my best,</i>

01:08:50.425 --> 01:08:55.294
<i>and I hope you're doing your
best, which means resting.</i>

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.429
<i>You don't have to
call me back.</i>

01:09:26.426 --> 01:09:27.930
Here it is.

01:09:37.537 --> 01:09:39.240
We won?

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.743
We won.

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:46.946
Eleanor won.

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:54.422
What?

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:59.491
They mentioned
the First Amendment argument.

01:09:59.493 --> 01:10:02.027
It's in a footnote.

01:10:10.104 --> 01:10:12.705
Well done,
well done, well done.

01:10:12.707 --> 01:10:15.978
Well done. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:27.855 --> 01:10:29.856
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:32.692
But my lawyer is bound
to have at least one.

01:10:32.694 --> 01:10:34.626
I'd like a merlot.
Thank you.

01:10:34.628 --> 01:10:36.728
Where are we?

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:41.233
We're in a Chinese restaurant.
We won my case, remember?

01:10:41.235 --> 01:10:44.036
That's what I thought.

01:10:44.038 --> 01:10:46.906
Can I recommend
the house special, duck?

01:10:46.908 --> 01:10:48.775
I don't know, can you?

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:52.245
It depends how you like
your duck cooked.

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:55.080
You're the restaurant.
Don't you know how to cook it?

01:10:55.082 --> 01:10:58.451
The duck would be perfect.
Maybe some vegetables too.

01:10:58.453 --> 01:11:00.853
How did I get here?

01:11:00.855 --> 01:11:04.792
We came with my Catholic
lawyer, Colette.

01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:10.996
Thank you.
I'm gonna need this.

01:11:10.998 --> 01:11:13.266
- I'd like one too.
- Yes, of course.

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:14.569
Can I have a 7UP?

01:11:20.274 --> 01:11:22.375
So just 'cause she's old,

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:25.111
they want to send her
to another convent.

01:11:25.113 --> 01:11:26.879
She doesn't wanna go there.

01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:29.116
- Do you, Sister?
- What?

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.183
You don't wanna go
to the new convent.

01:11:31.185 --> 01:11:33.952
I don't know.
Maybe it would be nice.

01:11:33.954 --> 01:11:35.621
No, it wouldn't.
It'd be terrible.

01:11:35.623 --> 01:11:37.425
That's why
I want you to sue 'em.

01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:40.927
- Sue who?
- The convent.

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:43.265
I want you to sue
the convent.

01:11:44.966 --> 01:11:47.433
I'm not about to sue
the Catholic Church.

01:11:47.435 --> 01:11:48.668
Why not?

01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:52.004
Because I'm not,
heh, heh, Eleanor.

01:11:52.006 --> 01:11:54.342
No, I'm... I'm just not.

01:12:05.185 --> 01:12:08.789
- I'll walk you upstairs.
- No, please, don't bother.

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.656
Sure you don't want me
to walk you up?

01:12:10.658 --> 01:12:11.790
Sure I'm sure.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:13.425
Big-shot lawyer,
who's too afraid

01:12:13.427 --> 01:12:15.128
to sue
the Catholic Church.

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:18.632
I'm moving you down
my prayer list to number 23.

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:20.232
The last position.

01:12:20.234 --> 01:12:23.902
You know, Eleanor,
you're not gravely disabled.

01:12:23.904 --> 01:12:26.207
You're gravely
obnoxious.

01:12:34.615 --> 01:12:36.316
That was a good one.

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:38.721
I'm still not suing
the Church.

01:12:40.454 --> 01:12:43.188
Oh, well.

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:45.493
You can walk me upstairs
anyway.

01:13:07.381 --> 01:13:10.148
- What do you think?
- I like it.

01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:11.720
Yeah?

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.710
- Colette Hughes.
- <i>Hi, it's Mort.</i>

01:13:37.712 --> 01:13:39.245
Hi.

01:13:39.247 --> 01:13:41.481
<i>I got bad news.
We just got notification.</i>

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:43.982
<i>St. Mary's petitioned
the State Supreme Court.</i>

01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:47.419
And the court has agreed
to review the decision.

01:13:47.421 --> 01:13:49.856
- What?
- <i>The hospital's gonna go after</i>

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:52.125
<i>every doctor in this country</i>

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:54.960
to send in amicus briefs
to support their position.

01:13:54.962 --> 01:13:57.897
So we have to round up
as many experts as we can

01:13:57.899 --> 01:13:59.232
to file for us.

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:01.133
Oh, God. You know
how much doctors hate

01:14:01.135 --> 01:14:04.236
testifying against other doctors
and pharmaceutical companies.

01:14:04.238 --> 01:14:06.406
You've got to look at it
like fishing.

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:08.875
We just keep casting
our lines...

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:11.443
<i>hoping we get a tug.</i>

01:14:11.445 --> 01:14:13.611
Oh, uh...

01:14:13.613 --> 01:14:18.085
- Could you tell Eleanor, please?
- I can't. She's at mass.

01:14:20.688 --> 01:14:22.088
But I'll see her tomorrow.

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.357
She invited me over
for Christmas.

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.692
<i>Okay, good night.</i>

01:14:29.363 --> 01:14:31.098
Merry Christmas.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:38.470
No! No! No!

01:14:38.472 --> 01:14:39.972
Help me!

01:14:39.974 --> 01:14:41.540
Help!

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:43.375
Help me!

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.646
That's Colette...

01:15:20.648 --> 01:15:22.684
- Thank you.
- ...and Robert.

01:15:25.485 --> 01:15:27.519
Merry Christmas.

01:15:27.521 --> 01:15:29.358
Merry Christmas.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.760
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

01:15:34.762 --> 01:15:37.162
Let me guess. Let me
guess what it is. Uh...

01:15:37.164 --> 01:15:39.866
- Beads for my rosaries.
- How'd you know?

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:43.468
- Merry Christmas, Colette.
- Merry Christmas, Sister.

01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:46.104
- Where's Robert?
- He's with his brother's family.

01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:47.042
Uh-huh.

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:51.579
What's the matter?

01:15:53.881 --> 01:15:55.714
The case isn't over.

01:15:55.716 --> 01:15:57.250
What?

01:15:57.252 --> 01:16:00.152
But I thought
the judges said we won.

01:16:00.154 --> 01:16:01.188
We did.

01:16:02.823 --> 01:16:05.089
But the hospital asked
the state Supreme Court

01:16:05.091 --> 01:16:06.759
to review the case

01:16:06.761 --> 01:16:09.027
to see if they agree
with the decision.

01:16:09.029 --> 01:16:10.863
And if they don't,

01:16:10.865 --> 01:16:13.598
then they could say
that the hospital

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.335
was right after all.

01:16:20.774 --> 01:16:22.709
Give me your coat.

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:24.143
Everyone...

01:16:24.145 --> 01:16:29.014
this is Colette,
she's my Catholic lawyer. Uh...

01:16:29.016 --> 01:16:31.049
Yeah, she's upset
because she says

01:16:31.051 --> 01:16:33.919
the court
could change its mind.

01:16:33.921 --> 01:16:36.022
- This is Noni.
- Hi there.

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:38.391
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Gabriella.

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:40.358
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.662
And you know Karen.
You got her out of restraints.

01:16:43.664 --> 01:16:46.266
- I wanted to thank you.
- I'm glad I was there.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:49.869
Yeah, you... Sit down.
I'll get you a 7UP.

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:53.272
Yeah. It's Hungry Man fried-
chicken dinners for everyone.

01:16:53.274 --> 01:16:56.875
Yeah, it's Christmas. You can't
let this ruin Christmas.

01:16:56.877 --> 01:16:58.311
No, we mustn't.

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:01.080
It's Christmas.
It's a time of hope.

01:17:01.082 --> 01:17:03.449
That's when our baby Jesus
was born.

01:17:03.451 --> 01:17:06.585
Hey, did you brush
your teeth?

01:17:06.587 --> 01:17:09.155
Yeah. Why did I buy you
a toothbrush for?

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:12.157
Go back. Brush
your teeth. Go on.

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:15.394
- Eleanor likes to help people.
- Yes, she does.

01:17:15.396 --> 01:17:17.228
Yeah, you won once.

01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:18.998
You'll win again.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.702
You gotta have faith.

01:17:26.106 --> 01:17:29.308
<i>I'm glad I reached you, doctor.
I hope you got my message</i>

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:31.643
<i>about supporting us
in the Eleanor Riese case.</i>

01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:33.646
<i>I did read it.
I'm not interested.</i>

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.113
I see.

01:17:35.115 --> 01:17:37.319
No, I see. Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

01:17:41.389 --> 01:17:42.656
<i>Solvang Clinic.</i>

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.790
Hi, I'd like
to speak with Dr. Brown.

01:17:44.792 --> 01:17:47.162
- <i>Who's calling?</i>
- Colette Hughes.

01:17:48.396 --> 01:17:50.161
I left a message yesterday.

01:17:50.163 --> 01:17:52.231
<i>Sorry, Dr. Brown
doesn't have the time.</i>

01:17:52.233 --> 01:17:54.500
- I understand.
- <i>Goodbye.</i>

01:17:54.502 --> 01:17:55.904
Thank you.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.507
<i>Hello.</i>

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.474
Dr. Wells,
hi. This is Colette Hughes.

01:18:02.476 --> 01:18:05.210
I'm one of the attorneys
on the Eleanor Riese case.

01:18:05.212 --> 01:18:07.446
<i>I'm familiar with the case.</i>

01:18:07.448 --> 01:18:11.017
Oh, great, I'm calling you
because I wanted to ask you...

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:14.353
Are you aware St. Mary's asked
me to write a brief for them?

01:18:14.355 --> 01:18:16.889
No, I... I didn't know that.

01:18:16.891 --> 01:18:20.025
But please, Dr. Wells,
if you would just...

01:18:20.027 --> 01:18:22.861
let me send you our papers.
Once you read them...

01:18:22.863 --> 01:18:24.331
I'm not sure I have time.

01:18:25.533 --> 01:18:28.168
Please, Dr. Wells.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:31.137
Good morning, may I
speak to the doctor, please?

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:32.705
<i>Who's calling?</i>

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.039
Colette Hughes.

01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:36.208
<i>Dr. Wells is busy
at the moment.</i>

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:37.843
Tell him I called again.

01:18:37.845 --> 01:18:41.714
I wanted to make sure he
got the package that I sent him.

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:44.317
- Please ask him to call me back.
- <i>Will do.</i>

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:45.687
- Thank you.
- <i>Bye.</i>

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:53.893
- Dr. Wells?
- No.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:56.064
But I have a tug
on another line.

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:05.204
You're experimenting
with the Riese decision

01:19:05.206 --> 01:19:06.738
with your short-term patients?

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.575
We are. We've seen
a definite improvement

01:19:09.577 --> 01:19:11.343
in the therapeutic
relationship

01:19:11.345 --> 01:19:14.045
when doctors and patients
work out treatments together.

01:19:14.047 --> 01:19:16.984
I have some figures
for you here.

01:19:20.087 --> 01:19:21.920
After a patient
leaves the hospital,

01:19:21.922 --> 01:19:23.789
they only keep taking
their medication

01:19:23.791 --> 01:19:26.759
if they trust their doctors.
There's a garbage can

01:19:26.761 --> 01:19:29.896
outside where I've seen
patients throw away medication

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:32.363
on the way out.
I don't want that to happen.

01:19:32.365 --> 01:19:36.902
Would you... be willing
to write that for us?

01:19:36.904 --> 01:19:38.704
Yes, I would.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:45.678
Hey, look what I found.
Right from the horse's mouth.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.513
The American Psychiatric
Association.

01:19:47.515 --> 01:19:49.248
You want to cite
an authority?

01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:52.250
They recommend informed consent
for antipsychotic drugs.

01:19:52.252 --> 01:19:57.121
And they talk about tardive
dyskinesia and cumulative doses.

01:19:57.123 --> 01:19:59.327
- This is wonderful.
- Yeah.

01:20:00.728 --> 01:20:02.126
More, more.

01:20:05.766 --> 01:20:08.467
Hey. How about going out
for dinner tonight?

01:20:08.469 --> 01:20:11.503
I'd love to, but the amicus
briefs are starting to come in.

01:20:11.505 --> 01:20:13.171
It's Sunday night.

01:20:13.173 --> 01:20:16.509
And tomorrow's Monday.
I have to get this done.

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:25.151
You got a message
from a Dr. Wells.

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:27.820
<i>What made me decide
to write a brief for you,</i>

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:30.156
was that one of the
psychiatric organizations

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:33.092
supporting the hospital
wrote the court

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:35.594
that you're trying
to tie doctors' hands

01:20:35.596 --> 01:20:38.664
over abstract issues.
The side effects

01:20:38.666 --> 01:20:41.601
of these medications
are anything but abstract.

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:45.137
Especially to people like
Eleanor Riese, who take them.

01:20:45.139 --> 01:20:48.174
What are you prepared
to address in your brief?

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.642
The hospital keeps saying

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:51.744
the drugs need to be given
immediately.

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.412
They neglect to say

01:20:53.414 --> 01:20:56.081
that immediate
administration of these drugs

01:20:56.083 --> 01:20:58.284
can interfere with diagnosis,

01:20:58.286 --> 01:21:02.687
because the side effects can be
mistaken for psychotic symptoms.

01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:05.223
Now that we got Dr. Wells,
how does the case look?

01:21:05.225 --> 01:21:07.293
It's better than yesterday.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:10.995
But it's a conservative court,
and we actually don't know why

01:21:10.997 --> 01:21:13.031
they decided
to hear this case.

01:21:13.033 --> 01:21:16.871
And we're not gonna know till
they hand down the decision.

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:25.977
What's going on?
What are you thinking?

01:21:25.979 --> 01:21:28.013
About my father.

01:21:28.015 --> 01:21:30.215
He experienced
a lot of obstacles

01:21:30.217 --> 01:21:33.054
for being
part American Indian.

01:21:36.356 --> 01:21:39.657
When we were writing our briefs
for the appeals court

01:21:39.659 --> 01:21:42.227
and talked about
the First Amendment argument,

01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:44.830
and I didn't keep arguing
with you,

01:21:44.832 --> 01:21:47.833
that was the American
Indian part of me.

01:21:47.835 --> 01:21:50.369
In that culture,
the way my father raised me,

01:21:50.371 --> 01:21:52.537
you don't argue
about things.

01:21:52.539 --> 01:21:55.074
You just present
what you feel is right,

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:57.175
and everyone's opinion
is weighed equally.

01:21:57.177 --> 01:21:59.948
And if it has any merit,
it's assumed you'll do it.

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:05.518
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- You didn't offend me.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.919
I'm glad he raised you
to be stubborn.

01:22:07.921 --> 01:22:09.790
It's good for the case.

01:22:20.634 --> 01:22:23.635
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

01:22:23.637 --> 01:22:25.470
You knew I was
going out of town.

01:22:25.472 --> 01:22:27.973
We were meeting with a doctor
to support your case.

01:22:27.975 --> 01:22:28.976
What happened?

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:34.481
- My mother died.
- Oh...

01:22:35.615 --> 01:22:37.450
I'm so sorry.

01:22:41.255 --> 01:22:44.759
- She died.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:22:49.128 --> 01:22:54.032
The man at the funeral home,
he was... He was so mean.

01:22:54.034 --> 01:22:57.436
He looked at me funny,
and he yelled at me.

01:22:57.438 --> 01:23:00.742
And he said I couldn't ride
in the limousine.

01:23:03.109 --> 01:23:05.777
He treated me
like I was nothing.

01:23:05.779 --> 01:23:08.580
Like I was a nobody.

01:23:08.582 --> 01:23:12.317
And then... And then...
And then Father Murray, he came.

01:23:12.319 --> 01:23:14.187
He came and he told them.

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:16.755
He made them let me ride
in the limousine.

01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:18.656
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

01:23:18.658 --> 01:23:20.925
I wasn't here for you.

01:23:20.927 --> 01:23:22.697
She's gone.

01:23:25.365 --> 01:23:27.098
I'm sorry.

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.203
Eleanor, I'm so sorry.

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:33.138
It's terrible
how they treat her.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.775
You got her a new urologist.
You got her a new psychiatrist.

01:23:36.777 --> 01:23:38.943
You've done as much
as you can right now.

01:23:38.945 --> 01:23:40.745
You are sending
in the Wells brief.

01:23:40.747 --> 01:23:42.580
You don't have
anything else to do,

01:23:42.582 --> 01:23:46.151
so I'm taking you
to Mexico.

01:23:46.153 --> 01:23:50.125
I got us a suite in a nice
little hotel on the ocean.

01:23:52.859 --> 01:23:54.626
We'll just be away
seven days.

01:23:54.628 --> 01:23:56.564
You can take
a week vacation, Colette.

01:23:57.931 --> 01:23:59.533
I bought the tickets.

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:04.769
When I wanna take a vacation,
I'll take a vacation.

01:24:04.771 --> 01:24:06.871
And when I do,
I'll pay for it myself.

01:24:06.873 --> 01:24:09.340
I can... I can
take care of myself.

01:24:09.342 --> 01:24:12.143
How am I supposed
to deal with you?

01:24:12.145 --> 01:24:14.312
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:24:14.314 --> 01:24:17.148
You're not your regular
run-of-the-mill workaholic.

01:24:17.150 --> 01:24:19.384
You're a workaholic
for an important cause.

01:24:19.386 --> 01:24:21.920
How can I be mad at you
for working so hard

01:24:21.922 --> 01:24:23.187
for something
so noble?

01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:26.058
It's like criticizing
a saint.

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.860
I never said
I was a saint.

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:30.597
I said I didn't want to take
a vacation with you.

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:37.201
Since the night we've met,
I've played by your rules.

01:24:37.203 --> 01:24:41.639
Now I'm asking you
to do something my way.

01:24:41.641 --> 01:24:46.044
This isn't about Eleanor
or the case. It's about...

01:24:46.046 --> 01:24:47.115
you and me.

01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:52.186
You're going to have to decide
if I have a place in your life.

01:25:13.707 --> 01:25:17.410
Yeah. Thank you
for letting me come over.

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:21.615
I didn't want to be on my own
today. I don't know why.

01:25:23.884 --> 01:25:27.521
- You got any 7UP?
- Let me see.

01:25:28.956 --> 01:25:32.057
You finally unpacked.
Congratulations.

01:25:32.059 --> 01:25:34.593
<i>Hi, Colette.</i>

01:25:34.595 --> 01:25:37.428
<i>If you change your mind
doing Mexico, please call...</i>

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:42.901
That was Robert, wasn't it?

01:25:42.903 --> 01:25:44.269
Yes, he...

01:25:44.271 --> 01:25:46.805
He wants you to go
to Mexico with him?

01:25:46.807 --> 01:25:49.441
- Yes, but...
- I can't believe...

01:25:49.443 --> 01:25:51.777
Why aren't you going
with him?

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:54.647
All we're doing is waiting now.
You can go tomorrow.

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:57.214
I don't wanna talk
about this, Eleanor.

01:25:57.216 --> 01:25:59.418
Why...? Why not?

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.553
Because you're
so perfect?

01:26:01.555 --> 01:26:04.123
- No.
- No, no, I get it.

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:06.892
I'm the one who's supposed
to have the problems

01:26:06.894 --> 01:26:09.594
'cause I'm the mental patient.
What about you?

01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:12.296
Are you so perfect because
you're a nurse and a lawyer?

01:26:12.298 --> 01:26:15.300
- Of course I'm not perfect.
- You say that.

01:26:15.302 --> 01:26:17.635
- You don't mean it.
- Of course I do.

01:26:17.637 --> 01:26:20.873
I'm always telling you
what I'm scared of.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:23.675
You never say
you're scared of anything.

01:26:23.677 --> 01:26:25.277
I'm scared of lots of things.

01:26:25.279 --> 01:26:29.583
Really? Like what?
What are you scared of?

01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:45.098
I'm scared of...

01:26:46.332 --> 01:26:48.166
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:26:48.168 --> 01:26:50.169
Why not?

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:52.103
'Cause I'm not smart enough?

01:26:52.105 --> 01:26:53.938
No.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.577
Because...

01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:02.884
I'm scared of...

01:27:06.119 --> 01:27:07.721
...letting people down.

01:27:13.493 --> 01:27:15.527
I'm scared of making a mistake

01:27:15.529 --> 01:27:18.198
by not seeing something
in my research.

01:27:21.702 --> 01:27:24.472
I'm scared of not doing enough.

01:27:27.073 --> 01:27:30.777
That no matter how hard I work,
I could never do enough.

01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:37.215
Colette, you couldn't work
harder if you were a machine.

01:27:37.217 --> 01:27:40.384
I've just worked so hard
for so long,

01:27:40.386 --> 01:27:42.920
putting myself
through nursing school,

01:27:42.922 --> 01:27:45.691
putting myself through
law school.

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:49.495
Working 16-, 18-,
20-hour days.

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:50.798
I...

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:59.774
I just don't know
how to be a person.

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.843
I don't know
if I ever knew how.

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:07.749
Don't you think
Robert knows how you are?

01:28:09.216 --> 01:28:11.251
Don't you think
he likes you anyway?

01:28:15.355 --> 01:28:18.723
What good does it do
if you win my case,

01:28:18.725 --> 01:28:21.460
you make other people's
lives better,

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:23.831
but you don't live
your own life?

01:28:25.932 --> 01:28:28.269
You've done
your best.

01:28:29.336 --> 01:28:32.039
You deserve to go.

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.740
Tell me
I'm not right.

01:28:35.742 --> 01:28:39.380
Just tell me I'm not right.

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:44.485
You are right.

01:28:49.489 --> 01:28:51.290
One thing.

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:55.326
When you two get married, you're
inviting me to the wedding.

01:28:55.328 --> 01:28:56.794
I promise you.

01:28:56.796 --> 01:28:58.796
If Robert and I
ever get married,

01:28:58.798 --> 01:29:01.599
you'll be the second to know,
right after me.

01:29:01.601 --> 01:29:05.206
Good. You got any ice?
It's not cold enough.

01:29:22.689 --> 01:29:23.988
- Colette.
- Yes?

01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:25.656
- They took Eleanor.
- What happened?

01:29:25.658 --> 01:29:27.393
They landed right out there,

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:30.062
these red lights
and yellow lights,

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:33.331
and their funny clothes,
these electronic voices and...

01:29:33.333 --> 01:29:36.067
- Oh, boy, they took her.
- Who took Eleanor?

01:29:36.069 --> 01:29:37.570
- They did.
- Who's "they"?

01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:41.173
They took her in an ambulance.
St. Abbon's Hospital.

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:44.345
- Right.
- St. Abbon's, thank you.

01:30:00.726 --> 01:30:03.128
- Ms. Hughes.
- Dr. Donnelly.

01:30:03.130 --> 01:30:05.696
- Where's Eleanor?
- You can't see her.

01:30:05.698 --> 01:30:08.200
- She's sleeping.
- What's wrong?

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:11.704
Psychologically,
Eleanor is Eleanor,

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:14.673
but medically she's very weak.
It's her old problem.

01:30:14.675 --> 01:30:16.540
Her bladder
and her kidneys.

01:30:16.542 --> 01:30:18.376
When she got
to the emergency room,

01:30:18.378 --> 01:30:21.879
they saw she'd been a mental
patient and sent her here.

01:30:21.881 --> 01:30:24.081
She should be
in the medical wing,

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:25.851
but they don't like
mental patients.

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:28.586
- We're doing the best we can.
- Can I see her?

01:30:28.588 --> 01:30:31.426
She'll be okay tonight.
Come back in the morning.

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:36.394
Hm.

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:41.101
Hm.

01:30:43.103 --> 01:30:45.239
I hope you like the flowers.

01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:49.076
Yeah.

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.912
You have to get better soon.

01:30:54.914 --> 01:30:57.281
I found out that
you're getting an award

01:30:57.283 --> 01:30:59.116
from the mental-health
advocates.

01:30:59.118 --> 01:31:02.086
They're gonna have a dinner,
they're giving you a plaque.

01:31:02.088 --> 01:31:04.223
Yeah, Colette,
I'm really scared.

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:06.523
- I know.
- I need you to get me out

01:31:06.525 --> 01:31:08.927
- of here before I die.
- You're not going to die.

01:31:08.929 --> 01:31:11.429
You just need to get
your blood stronger.

01:31:11.431 --> 01:31:14.098
No, I'm gonna die.

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:17.568
I'm gonna die, and you have
to arrange for my funeral.

01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:19.271
I'm not arranging
for your funeral.

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:20.906
You're gonna get better.

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:24.276
I want a Catholic funeral.
And I want a lot of flowers.

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:26.745
- I don't wanna hear this.
- A lot of flowers.

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:29.748
Dr. Donnelly said that you need
to get your blood stronger.

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:32.450
I wanna be laid out
in an open coffin

01:31:32.452 --> 01:31:35.820
with a statue of the Blessed
Mother looking over me.

01:31:35.822 --> 01:31:39.357
And I want my blue crystal
rosary in my hand.

01:31:39.359 --> 01:31:42.693
And make sure
they do my makeup right.

01:31:42.695 --> 01:31:45.131
I don't want it heavy,
like yours.

01:32:03.984 --> 01:32:07.952
I'm out of practice praying.

01:32:07.954 --> 01:32:10.891
But I know you're not
out of practice listening.

01:32:14.461 --> 01:32:16.160
Please...

01:32:16.162 --> 01:32:18.365
watch over Eleanor.

01:32:21.201 --> 01:32:23.804
Please, heal her.

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:28.639
Please...

01:32:28.641 --> 01:32:30.510
ease her pain.

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:48.861
The attendants lost my keys.

01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:50.361
I know.

01:32:50.363 --> 01:32:52.263
They're not supposed
to lose your keys.

01:32:52.265 --> 01:32:55.099
When you leave, they're supposed
to return your property.

01:32:55.101 --> 01:32:58.070
It says so in the form when you
sign it. I wanna sue them.

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.638
I thought
we had this resolved.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.641
We're gonna borrow
your landlord's keys.

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:04.809
Yeah, but what they did
was wrong.

01:33:04.811 --> 01:33:06.844
I know.

01:33:06.846 --> 01:33:08.812
I want you to
at least threaten them.

01:33:08.814 --> 01:33:11.915
No, I'm not
gonna do anything.

01:33:11.917 --> 01:33:14.352
What? You don't care.

01:33:14.354 --> 01:33:15.986
You're right.
I don't care.

01:33:15.988 --> 01:33:17.688
Okay, that's it.
You're fired.

01:33:17.690 --> 01:33:20.058
I'm Eleanor Riese.

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.727
There are hundreds of lawyers
who'd wanna work for me.

01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:26.031
You can fire me
if you want, Eleanor,

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:27.635
but I'm here
as your friend.

01:33:34.274 --> 01:33:38.179
Yes. I am. Come on.

01:33:51.091 --> 01:33:52.991
Colette, stop. Stop.

01:33:52.993 --> 01:33:54.759
- Where? What?
- Let's go.

01:33:54.761 --> 01:33:57.995
- Let's go to the wedding.
- You wanna go to a wedding?

01:33:57.997 --> 01:33:59.766
Yeah. Come on.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.034
I don't know them,

01:34:03.036 --> 01:34:05.439
but nobody minds
if you just go in and watch.

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:19.384
Yeah. Let's sit over there.

01:34:19.386 --> 01:34:21.652
Over here. Just here.

01:34:21.654 --> 01:34:23.921
Yeah. I always choose
the side

01:34:23.923 --> 01:34:25.824
that doesn't have
as many guests.

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:29.697
Yeah. That way, the bride
or groom will feel better.

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:46.646
Isn't it
beautiful?

01:34:49.315 --> 01:34:52.116
It is
beautiful.

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:07.098
This is Colette Hughes.

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.000
Yes, Ms. Hughes.
I think you wanna check

01:35:10.002 --> 01:35:11.639
if your mail's
arrived yet.

01:35:15.943 --> 01:35:18.311
- Was there any mail for me?
- Um...

01:35:21.314 --> 01:35:24.551
Uh, there's one from the
Supreme Court of California.

01:35:38.832 --> 01:35:40.034
Where are we going?

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:46.103
- No. Come on, you gotta tell me.
- You'll see.

01:35:46.105 --> 01:35:48.908
No, come on. It's unfair.
You gotta tell me.

01:35:50.043 --> 01:35:51.144
What?

01:35:52.278 --> 01:35:54.278
Tell me. Tell me.
Tell me.

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.216
Why are we here?

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:00.585
The Supreme Court,

01:36:00.587 --> 01:36:04.688
they decided not to review
the case after all.

01:36:04.690 --> 01:36:06.758
We won. You won.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.863
- I won?
- Mm-hm.

01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:12.432
We won.

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:18.035
We won!

01:36:18.037 --> 01:36:22.406
- We won! We won. We won.
- Let's shop.

01:36:22.408 --> 01:36:25.576
- We won. We won!
- Come on.

01:36:25.578 --> 01:36:27.344
We won! Yeah!

01:36:27.346 --> 01:36:30.882
Yeah! Let's... Let's shop!

01:36:30.884 --> 01:36:33.253
- Sofas! Yes, sofas!
- Yes. Yes, sofas.

01:36:34.354 --> 01:36:36.454
How do you think it looks?

01:36:36.456 --> 01:36:37.955
Perfect.

01:36:37.957 --> 01:36:40.991
Yeah, I wish
my mother could see it.

01:36:43.963 --> 01:36:45.930
Do you hear
something different?

01:36:49.135 --> 01:36:50.668
Just the McGuire Sisters.

01:36:50.670 --> 01:36:54.438
Yeah, but on my new hi-fi

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.211
from Mr. Cohen. It's a present.

01:37:00.345 --> 01:37:03.647
- Hey. Did you bring the camera?
- Yep.

01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:06.250
How about you
take a photo of me

01:37:06.252 --> 01:37:09.454
- on my new couch...
- Good idea.

01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:11.156
...listening to my new hi-fi.

01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:19.496
- Is that okay?
- Perfect.

01:37:19.498 --> 01:37:22.900
- Okay.
- Hang on.

01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:33.343
Father Galluzzo
was the first person

01:37:33.345 --> 01:37:36.447
who bought me Dreyer's
vanilla ice cream.

01:37:36.449 --> 01:37:38.583
Yeah.

01:37:38.585 --> 01:37:40.718
Yeah, I was 10.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.787
And I was in
a Catholic hospital,

01:37:43.789 --> 01:37:45.359
and he bought it
for me.

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.595
Mm.

01:37:49.895 --> 01:37:54.165
He had this beautiful, thick,
white hair. It was white.

01:37:54.167 --> 01:37:55.836
Like the ice cream.

01:37:57.203 --> 01:38:01.238
When I have it,
it reminds me of him.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.540
And it makes me feel good...

01:38:03.542 --> 01:38:06.244
because he was
so very kind to me.

01:38:06.246 --> 01:38:09.981
And I always buy it
in a half-gallon container...

01:38:09.983 --> 01:38:12.284
just like
the one he bought for me.

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:15.486
That was when they put
the shunt in my head...

01:38:15.488 --> 01:38:19.825
to drain the water off my brain
after I had spinal meningitis.

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:22.293
Yeah. Before that,
I wasn't retarded,

01:38:22.295 --> 01:38:25.629
and nobody called me
mentally ill.

01:38:25.631 --> 01:38:27.201
I was just like everybody else.

01:38:28.467 --> 01:38:29.869
I know.

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.709
Do you remember
when you were 10?

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.581
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:38:43.583 --> 01:38:45.051
Yeah.

01:38:48.688 --> 01:38:53.223
When I was 10, my little
sister was really sick...

01:38:53.225 --> 01:38:55.393
...and she died.

01:38:55.395 --> 01:38:57.294
And I...

01:38:57.296 --> 01:38:59.563
I loved her very much.

01:38:59.565 --> 01:39:03.534
We didn't have enough money
to afford a stone for her grave.

01:39:03.536 --> 01:39:07.437
And the only one who could
console me was my grandmother.

01:39:07.439 --> 01:39:10.375
And she was
a wonderful woman.

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:12.376
She was friends with
everybody.

01:39:12.378 --> 01:39:16.048
All different kinds of people
from all different races.

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:17.781
And...

01:39:17.783 --> 01:39:19.549
she was very artistic.

01:39:19.551 --> 01:39:24.421
She wore lots of bracelets
and a big necklace, earrings.

01:39:24.423 --> 01:39:26.126
Lots of color.

01:39:27.359 --> 01:39:29.729
And I loved being with her.

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:34.098
But sometimes...

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:35.799
...she'd get depressed,

01:39:35.801 --> 01:39:38.471
so my parents would have
to put her in a hospital.

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:41.606
But I never...

01:39:41.608 --> 01:39:44.241
I never loved her any less.

01:39:44.243 --> 01:39:45.813
And I really miss her.

01:39:56.823 --> 01:39:58.992
You have a lot of love
in you, Colette.

01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:02.861
Thank you.

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:04.231
So do you, Eleanor.

01:41:38.323 --> 01:41:41.025
- Mr. Young.
- There's a phone call for you.

01:41:41.027 --> 01:41:44.594
- Please take a message.
- They say it's urgent.

01:41:44.596 --> 01:41:49.099
I'm sorry, will you wait
just a moment? Thank you.

01:41:49.101 --> 01:41:50.535
She'll be right with you.

01:41:52.939 --> 01:41:54.807
This is Colette Hughes.

01:41:57.243 --> 01:41:58.478
Yes.

01:42:06.886 --> 01:42:08.255
Oh, no.

01:42:18.597 --> 01:42:20.134
Thank you.

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.747
This is yours.

01:43:08.215 --> 01:43:10.984
The decision
from the Court of Appeal.

01:43:15.889 --> 01:43:18.559
You were a brave woman,
Eleanor.

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:31.436
I better wipe off
some of that makeup.

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:34.875
I wouldn't want you to have
to come back and tell me off.

01:44:06.238 --> 01:44:10.340
<i>We are here tonight
to honor and to celebrate...</i>

01:44:10.342 --> 01:44:12.742
Eleanor Riese.

01:44:12.744 --> 01:44:15.580
Accepting this award
in Eleanor's honor...

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:18.385
is my colleague
Colette Hughes.

01:44:41.707 --> 01:44:42.975
Um...

01:44:49.882 --> 01:44:52.653
I... I first met
Eleanor Riese...

01:44:59.492 --> 01:45:01.128
Excuse me.

01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:07.165
I first met Eleanor Riese
as her lawyer,

01:45:07.167 --> 01:45:10.468
but soon because...

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:13.974
Eleanor was Eleanor,
she became my friend.

01:45:18.411 --> 01:45:23.781
And soon, heh,
because Eleanor was Eleanor,

01:45:23.783 --> 01:45:27.085
she became my protector,
my guardian,

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:30.257
my worst critic,
and my greatest support.

01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:33.590
She constantly reminded me

01:45:33.592 --> 01:45:35.626
through her presence
in my life,

01:45:35.628 --> 01:45:38.161
that we weren't
just working on a case.

01:45:38.163 --> 01:45:42.900
That this wasn't just about law.
It was about people.

01:45:42.902 --> 01:45:45.835
The human right
to be respected,

01:45:45.837 --> 01:45:50.308
and the human duty to treat
each other with respect.

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:53.945
Even though Eleanor wanted
passionately to win,

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:56.847
she had a profound knowledge
that I didn't have...

01:45:56.849 --> 01:45:58.616
which was...

01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:02.222
we could only do our best,
as she could only do her best.

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:07.625
Eleanor was in pain
every single day of her life.

01:46:07.627 --> 01:46:09.794
It astounds me
that she could ever think

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:11.664
about anybody else,
but she did.

01:46:12.798 --> 01:46:14.397
All the time.

01:46:14.399 --> 01:46:15.902
That was Eleanor.

01:46:17.336 --> 01:46:19.469
She walked up...

01:46:19.471 --> 01:46:22.906
the 27 steps to her apartment
every day without complaining,

01:46:22.908 --> 01:46:26.177
and every day she found
something in her life...

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:29.382
to enjoy,
something to be grateful for.

01:46:31.818 --> 01:46:35.518
But, as Mort said, she won
the fight she wanted to win.

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.688
The Riese decision will affect
the lives of hundreds

01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:40.958
of thousands of people
for the better.

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.695
People who might
one day find themselves

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:45.896
in the hospital like she was.

01:46:45.898 --> 01:46:49.002
People who will need
their voices to be heard.

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:54.804
Sometimes when I find
myself...

01:46:54.806 --> 01:46:58.344
overwhelmed by how much
there still is to do,

01:47:00.146 --> 01:47:04.748
I'll see those big eyes of hers
and that mischievous grin,

01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:07.050
and I'll think she's
still looking down at me.

01:47:07.052 --> 01:47:09.620
I better sit down
and have a 7UP.

01:47:09.622 --> 01:47:11.854
And I'll hear her say:

01:47:11.856 --> 01:47:15.295
"Tell me I'm not right.
Just tell me I'm not right."
