03:16.200 --> 03:17.247
It had to be a cow.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.085
Couldn't be like a dog or something
that isn't 10,000 pounds.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.936
- Come on! Can you just help me, dude?
- I'm doing all the work here, man.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.406
- Push! Push! Come on!
- Jason, it stepped on my foot.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.720
Pull yourself together.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.776
Just tie it to the bench

03:28.800 --> 03:30.816
- and let's get out of here, please.
- Cow seems unhappy, huh?

03:30.840 --> 03:33.320
Well, it shouldn't be unhappy,
because I just milked her.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.488
Him.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.562
- You just milked him.
- This is a him?

03:37.640 --> 03:39.369
- Was it one udder?
- Yeah.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.696
Yeah, that's not an udder, dude.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.016
I was gonna say,
it was actually kinda weird.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.656
It was really big,
and I had to use two hands.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.656
- It didn't...
- Stop. We will never discuss this again.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.681
That'd be great.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.856
Cops!

03:50.880 --> 03:52.325
The cops are coming.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.730
Beefcake, hide!

04:18.399 --> 04:21.051
What? I'm sorry, Beefcake!

04:21.120 --> 04:22.884
Whoo!

04:23.880 --> 04:24.881
Yeah!

04:26.760 --> 04:28.000
Damn!

04:28.120 --> 04:29.200
Whoa!

04:34.360 --> 04:35.407
Okay.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.167
Come on.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.005
Whoo! Yeah!

04:46.080 --> 04:48.447
Whoa!

04:48.520 --> 04:50.090
Whoa!

05:26.080 --> 05:28.560
You know, I don't think we're ever gonna
understand each other.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.126
Just when I think you've done
the dumbest thing you could possibly do,

05:33.200 --> 05:35.009
you find something
even dumber and you do it.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.003
Thank you.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.526
I promise you, this is not the moment
to be a wiseass.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.936
And I know you think it's noble
that you didn't rat out your friends.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.800
I acted alone.
Beefcake and I had a connection.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.649
Yeah, that's funny.
You know what's not funny?

05:48.640 --> 05:50.449
This was supposed to be your season.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.522
I had scouts coming to every game.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.001
You could have written your own ticket.
Now it's all gone.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.048
Now you gotta come here every Saturday

05:58.120 --> 06:00.771
for the rest of the year
just so you can graduate!

06:00.880 --> 06:03.486
With all these other weirdos
and criminals.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.810
Yeah.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.009
Like you said,
we'll never understand each other.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.208
<i>One play left
in the entire game.</i>

06:18.280 --> 06:20.647
<i>Can Angel Grove do it?
They're down by five.</i>

06:20.720 --> 06:23.296
<i>Jason Scott takes his position
at quarterback. Here comes the snap.</i>

06:23.320 --> 06:25.136
<i>Wide receiver Marty Borne
looks like he's open.</i>

06:25.160 --> 06:26.764
<i>He's getting ready for a pass.</i>

06:26.840 --> 06:29.127
<i>Jason Scott makes...
no, no, wait, he doesn't make a pass!</i>

06:29.240 --> 06:31.368
<i>What a pump fake!
He's running with the ball.</i>

06:31.440 --> 06:34.728
<i>He's at the 20, the 15, the ten.
Jason Scott scores!</i>

06:34.800 --> 06:36.643
<i>Touchdown!</i>

06:36.720 --> 06:40.611
<i>Jason Scott singlehandedly
brings the team home for the championship!</i>

07:07.040 --> 07:09.520
Moo!

07:09.600 --> 07:11.616
That's so funny.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.007
Hey, you sure
you're in the right room?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.400
Oh, big tough guy.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.726
This one goes here.
That one goes there.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.689
Primary colors go on this side,

07:23.760 --> 07:25.360
this one goes...

07:26.040 --> 07:27.485
I'm sorry.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.641
Here, let me help you.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.889
You're a freak. You know that?

07:31.960 --> 07:33.776
I've had to watch you play
with these for weeks.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.847
Are you crazy?

07:35.840 --> 07:37.365
No? What if you had an extra one?

07:37.440 --> 07:39.080
Freak.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.096
Why don't you cut this little act
and do something?

07:41.120 --> 07:42.485
Why don't you stop me? Huh?

07:42.560 --> 07:44.324
- Are you gonna stop...
- Hey!

07:44.440 --> 07:46.568
How old are you? Five?

07:47.600 --> 07:51.161
Hi, I'm Jason. It's my first time here.
It's exciting.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.931
And you must be the bully of detention.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.570
How dumb can you be?

07:59.800 --> 08:01.006
Oh!

08:02.440 --> 08:03.680
Did you just slap me?

08:03.760 --> 08:06.491
I did. Weird, right?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.130
Now I'm gonna be here every day

08:08.200 --> 08:11.204
for what seems like the rest of my life,
and I'm sure that you are, too.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.884
So let's make a deal.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.724
Don't sit near me,

08:14.800 --> 08:15.801
or him,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.086
and we'll be okay.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.362
Okay!

08:24.480 --> 08:26.005
Uh, approved homework,

08:26.080 --> 08:28.447
or working on
the <i>Better Choices</i> workbook.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.456
- These should be out and in progress.
- I need to go to the ladies' room.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.643
Uh... Okay. And good morning.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.086
Oh, my God.

08:42.159 --> 08:44.640
I got your text and I was like,
"Where are they?"

08:44.720 --> 08:47.963
So, this is where you come every Saturday
instead of practice.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.407
- God, this must suck.
- It does.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.536
Well, then you shouldn't have
sent Ty that picture of me.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.245
That's not exactly how it happened.
I mean, he's a liar.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.846
- You punched his tooth out.
- They put it back.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.127
Water under the bridge now.
Let's move on.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.328
Oh, thank God.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.131
We're moving on. Without you.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.487
Cutting you out. Literally.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.609
You can show up for cheer practice
if you want,

09:12.680 --> 09:14.444
but I wouldn't.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.800
Damn, girl!

10:14.640 --> 10:16.642
Oh, my God, what have you done?

10:16.760 --> 10:17.816
Kimberly,
what have you done to your hair?

10:17.840 --> 10:19.016
You cut off your hair?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.880
- Hey... door!
- Kimberly what...

10:22.280 --> 10:24.044
Hey, thanks for that in there.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.566
Ah, no worries. I hate guys like that.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.326
Yeah. Oh... so, hey, we should,
uh, hang out sometime, huh?

10:30.440 --> 10:33.284
Not that we have to.
But I think tonight we should.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.129
- What's your name again?
- Billy.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.770
Billy Cranston.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.126
Or William Cranston.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.210
You remember kids used to call me
Billy Crams-tons as a third-grade joke?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.203
Like Billy crams tons of crayons
in his butt.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.170
Which I didn't!
But it's really impossible to

10:46.240 --> 10:47.376
cram a ton of crayons in a butt.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.496
- No, no, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that.
- Okay, Billy,

10:48.520 --> 10:51.603
I would honestly hang outwith you,
but I have a date every night

10:51.680 --> 10:53.296
with the Angel Grove Sheriff's Department.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.606
So... I'm sorry.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.967
Wait... no, no, no.
Don't leave, don't leave, hey.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.089
All right, so I don't really expect
for us to hang out.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.736
Truth is I need to get somewhere tonight,
and I could really use your help.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.286
Billy, I hear you, but as I told you,
I have house arrest.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.362
There's nothing I can do about it.
I'm sorry.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.807
Well, like, I mean,
I can fix that.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.201
I know how to trick the SIM.
I have, uh... I have tools.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.362
I have to be in my house before 7:00.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.896
Well, if you come
to my house before 7:00,

11:15.920 --> 11:17.081
then I can fix it for you.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.766
Oh! I also have a car. Or access to a car.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.764
And if you decide to help me,
you can have the car for a few hours.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.048
Come on, honey. Let's go.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.011
Don't be so hard on him.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.287
How do you think he feels
walking around town now?

11:55.400 --> 11:57.880
How do you think I feel
walking around town now?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.256
Let's not do this tonight.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.441
What's the plan, huh?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.568
What's he gonna do with his life?

12:02.640 --> 12:04.051
He could've been so much more.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.920
Get out of the way!

12:22.760 --> 12:24.320
Oh, my God, is that Jason Scott?

12:31.040 --> 12:33.008
Oh, my God! Jason Scott!

12:33.080 --> 12:35.686
- Billy?
- Yeah.

12:35.760 --> 12:36.921
- Billy!
- Yes?

12:38.080 --> 12:39.491
- It's 6:56...
- 6:56, I know.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.016
You got four minutes. Grab that chair.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.044
- What's all this stuff?
- It's objects that I found with my dad.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.736
Most of it is his.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.411
- Hey.
- Where's the cage? Where's the cage?

12:48.480 --> 12:50.005
Here. Here it is.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.645
- Put your foot in this.
- What is it?

12:51.720 --> 12:54.216
It's a Faraday cage. it should stop
the cell signal if we're lucky.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.456
That's the three-minute warning.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.086
- Come on, bud. If the signal goes off...
- My dad's been dead

12:58.160 --> 13:01.801
now seven years,
four months, and two days?

13:01.880 --> 13:03.644
- Yeah, two days.
- Um, okay, um...

13:03.760 --> 13:06.047
That's a long time.
He used to work at the mine.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.487
Billy, I really don't think
that we have time...

13:08.600 --> 13:10.250
You still live at 4455 Old Wharf?

13:10.320 --> 13:11.576
- Yes... yes, I do.
- Great house.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.887
- Okay.
- So, yeah, about my dad.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.560
We used to go and find objects together.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.840
Some really, really old.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.136
I'm gonna get in trouble, Billy.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.776
Oh! Almost like that show
<i>American Pickers.</i>

13:19.800 --> 13:21.016
Billy, the signal's gonna go off.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.096
We should've definitely
had our own TV show.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.616
That would've been so crazy.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.336
What are you doing?

13:25.360 --> 13:27.044
Dude, come on, seriously!

13:27.160 --> 13:28.446
It's gonna go... Billy, come on!

13:28.520 --> 13:30.522
What?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.531
Thank you.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.007
Mmm-hmm.
Can you stop touching me now?

13:50.360 --> 13:52.056
It's so cool
you actually showed up.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.730
Well, you are giving me the van.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.610
Lending you the van. But, yeah.

13:56.680 --> 13:57.761
How much further is it?

13:57.840 --> 14:01.242
Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.805
Uh... Okay.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.211
Thank you for helping me today.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.322
That's okay, Billy.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.730
Uh... Okay, this is the entrance

14:10.800 --> 14:13.451
to the gold mine, and clearly,
Billy, the sign says...

14:13.520 --> 14:15.602
Keep driving.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.121
Okay.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.376
If we find something cool,
then you can keep half.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.856
- It's a rule that me and my dad made.
- Thanks, Billy.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.850
They're gonna blow
this whole thing.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.206
It'll all be gone in a week.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.204
Billy, can I be honest? The deal was
I drop you somewhere,

14:31.280 --> 14:32.964
and I get the van
for a few hours, okay?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.451
This is weird.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.056
Like, we don't know each other at all.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.844
I don't know what we're doing here.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.096
- And you seem kinda...
- Wait, I gotta tell you something, okay?

14:40.120 --> 14:41.121
I'm on the spectrum.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.564
Well, is that like a workout program?

14:44.640 --> 14:45.766
Like Tae Bo?

14:45.840 --> 14:49.083
No. It's a diagnosis. Excuse me.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.329
I know. It was a joke. I was kidding.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.209
See, that's the thing.
I didn't get the joke.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.284
Like my brain doesn't work the same
as yours does, you know?

14:57.360 --> 15:00.170
Yeah, well,
consider that a good thing.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.084
It's just that I can't read
humor or... or sarcasm.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.456
- Oh! But I do remember things.
- Okay.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.720
- I remember everything.
- Okay.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.801
Billy, let me stop you.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.086
Okay.

15:08.160 --> 15:11.801
You don't need to tell me all this.
We're cool.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.047
Okay. Well, we're almost there.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.456
Which is good news, so...

15:16.480 --> 15:19.324
Take my spare flashlight now,
'cause it's gonna be dark

15:19.400 --> 15:20.845
- when we get back.
- Bye, Billy!

15:22.840 --> 15:24.046
Okay!

15:38.640 --> 15:41.007
Ah, she's back again.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.607
Oh, crazy girl.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.081
Just like clockwork.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.963
Who are you?

16:35.560 --> 16:38.086
No way!

16:41.760 --> 16:43.967
Uh... hello?

16:46.240 --> 16:47.526
Hey!

16:49.640 --> 16:51.051
Hey!

16:54.560 --> 16:57.404
No, no, no, no. Kimberly!

16:58.400 --> 16:59.640
Kimberly!

16:59.720 --> 17:01.848
Okay. Okay.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.960
- It's strange to hear you say my name.
- What?

17:06.160 --> 17:07.570
What did you say?

17:07.640 --> 17:10.040
I said, it's strange
to hear you say my name.

17:10.119 --> 17:11.121
Like we know each other.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.204
We... we do know each other.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.522
Oh, we know who each other are,
but we don't really know each other.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.210
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.851
Oh. Then you know
I punched his tooth out.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.204
I know they put it back.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.484
Dad, I hope you're watching.
Gonna make you proud.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.680
Dad, I forgot to tell you, uh,

17:42.760 --> 17:45.411
I took the van without
asking Mom's permission.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.801
Well, I'm telling you,
so I think that's okay.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.809
Anyways, I gotta focus. Okay.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.163
So what are you doing up here?
Did you follow me?

17:53.240 --> 17:56.005
I, uh, came with... Billy.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.801
Billy Cranston? Weird.
But I've seen him up here before.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.962
My house is on the other side
of the mountain.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.247
I hike these trails sometimes,
clear my head,

18:05.320 --> 18:08.563
and I stare down
at Angel Grove and wonder

18:08.640 --> 18:11.484
how such a small, crap town
could cause me such misery.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.643
That funny to you?

18:15.760 --> 18:17.603
No, I just... I feel the same way.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.446
Yeah. Jason Scott, star quarterback,
crashes and burns.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.602
Destroys his career
and destroys our season.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.966
Go Tigers.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.447
Yeah, now I walk around town
and everyone's looking at me

18:27.520 --> 18:29.409
like I ran over their dog.

18:31.080 --> 18:34.004
So why don't you leave?
You know, just go.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.970
- I could leave here, you know?
- Where?

18:37.040 --> 18:38.280
God, anywhere.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.930
So let's go.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.650
What?

18:41.720 --> 18:43.529
- You'd never do it.
- Try me.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.244
Oh, what, you and me? You got a car?

18:45.320 --> 18:47.687
- I have a van.
- Ooh, that's creepy.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.016
It's not that kind of van.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.530
Every van is that kind of van.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.931
So, let's go.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.042
Are you daring me? 'Cause I'll go.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.641
Okay.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.241
Dad, get ready.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.920
That didn't work.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.325
Whoa! Whoa!

19:22.400 --> 19:23.936
- That really rung my bell.
- Hey, hey, hey!

19:23.960 --> 19:25.136
Go, go, go, go, go!

19:25.160 --> 19:26.924
- Oh! Wow!
- Hey!

19:28.080 --> 19:29.081
What are you doing, dude?

19:29.160 --> 19:30.616
I been digging up here for some years.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.086
Hey! Easy, guy. Let's sort this out, huh?

19:33.160 --> 19:35.003
- I seen him up here before.
- Hey, Jason.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.367
Dude cannot be walking around
blowing stuff up!

19:37.440 --> 19:39.408
I was just trying to dig
a little deeper!

19:39.480 --> 19:40.520
Maybe I dug too deep, huh?

19:40.560 --> 19:43.006
Billy, you don't have to yell.
We can hear you, okay?

19:43.080 --> 19:45.242
- Okay!
- Hey!

19:45.320 --> 19:47.288
You guys looking
to get busted or something?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.124
This place is a restricted area!

19:49.200 --> 19:51.328
Oh, really, Einstein? Restricted?

19:51.400 --> 19:54.051
As in, we shouldn't be standing
on crazy rocks

19:54.120 --> 19:55.610
doing <i>Karate Kid</i> moves, right?

19:55.680 --> 19:57.045
Uh... Guys...

19:57.120 --> 19:58.121
Yeah. I see you.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.329
Yeah, or camping out on old trains.
I see you, too, homeboy.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.696
Uh, guys...

20:02.720 --> 20:04.416
There's a lotta mine security
out tonight.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.776
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.040
I've never seen her before.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.804
Oh, no.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.240
Whoa!

20:23.560 --> 20:24.971
Are you okay?

20:25.040 --> 20:26.849
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.321
Whoa.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.363
What is it?

20:37.440 --> 20:38.646
Whoa.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.923
I've never seen glass like this before.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.411
Oh, my God.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.888
What is it? What is that?

21:04.960 --> 21:06.883
There's something in there.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.281
Move.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.840
- All right, watch out, watch out. Look!
- What are you doing?

21:12.920 --> 21:14.843
- Wait, no, no, no! No, no!
- Seriously?

21:14.960 --> 21:16.560
- What are you doing?
- Oh, yeah!

21:20.520 --> 21:21.816
My dad always knew the right spots.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.649
There's gotta be more. Let's get it!

21:23.760 --> 21:26.240
- Get out of the way.
- That doesn't mean keep banging!

21:26.280 --> 21:27.281
Oh!

21:27.360 --> 21:28.486
What is it?

21:30.640 --> 21:31.971
What is that?

21:35.080 --> 21:36.456
- What? No, no! Don't break it.
- No. No, no, no!

21:36.480 --> 21:38.767
Don't break it! Don't break it!
Don't break...

21:38.840 --> 21:40.444
You broke it. Okay.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.761
Wow. What?

21:52.280 --> 21:53.611
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.842
Yo, look, we all found these.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.008
- If they're worth any money...
- No, he found them.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.296
Now chill out.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.368
- Chill out?
- Guys, guys, do you hear that?

22:03.440 --> 22:05.329
Mine security. Peace.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.846
Somebody should have pointed
that out. Wait, I did.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.809
Billy!

22:09.880 --> 22:11.644
- Wait, okay, okay.
- Run!

22:12.640 --> 22:14.085
Billy! Just run to the... come on!

22:14.160 --> 22:15.605
Billy, let's go!

22:15.680 --> 22:17.200
- Haul ass, dude!
- I'm coming!

22:18.160 --> 22:20.120
Are you kidding me?

22:22.920 --> 22:24.126
Ja... Jason! Jason!

22:24.200 --> 22:25.296
- What are you doing?
- You gotta open the doors!

22:25.320 --> 22:26.401
Open the door!

22:26.480 --> 22:28.608
- Yes, okay, just get in.
- What are you doing?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.136
Did you see them?
Are they down the road?

22:30.160 --> 22:31.161
- I don't know.
- Okay.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.656
Okay, what about the others?

22:34.680 --> 22:37.126
- You gonna leave the others?
- Hold on.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.602
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jason!

22:47.800 --> 22:49.689
Whoo!

22:49.760 --> 22:51.496
- Oh, my mom's gonna kill me.
<i>- Stop right there!</i>

22:51.520 --> 22:54.729
- Shit! Put your seat belt on.
- I got my seat belt on!

22:54.800 --> 22:56.564
- Jason! Somebody's gonna die.
- Whoa!

22:56.640 --> 22:58.404
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoo-hoo!

22:59.440 --> 23:00.805
Whoa!

23:02.160 --> 23:03.536
- There they are!
- Okay, so...

23:03.560 --> 23:05.336
- Up the hill. Come on!
- Get 'em!

23:05.360 --> 23:06.616
Okay!

23:06.640 --> 23:08.536
- Okay, you drive.
- No, I... I really don't drive.

23:08.560 --> 23:12.042
Okay, then really don't drive,
so I can pull them in.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.736
I don't drive!

23:13.760 --> 23:15.171
Get your foot!

23:15.240 --> 23:16.936
- I got it.
- Wait, it says that the door's open.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.724
That's because it's open, Billy.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.485
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:23.040 --> 23:24.849
- Go, go, go!
- Okay. Okay.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.082
There they are!
Get closer to them.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.161
Get in!

23:30.200 --> 23:31.247
Gotcha.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.446
- I gotcha!
- I'm in!

23:36.360 --> 23:37.691
What about the other guy?

23:39.880 --> 23:41.609
- Just go!
- Go! Go!

23:41.680 --> 23:43.640
Billy, look out!

23:46.960 --> 23:48.616
Let's go downhill! Go to the lights below!

23:48.640 --> 23:50.056
- You wanna drive now?
- Keep going, Billy,

23:50.080 --> 23:52.287
- we're almost there.
- Guys! Guys, there's a train.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.964
We got it.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.761
Okay.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.216
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

24:02.240 --> 24:03.685
Hey!

24:03.760 --> 24:04.856
Hey, what do you want me to do?

24:04.880 --> 24:06.216
- Hey!
- Keep going! I'll pull him in!

24:06.240 --> 24:08.004
Okay.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.041
Are you crazy?

24:11.120 --> 24:12.610
Yeah, I am.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.765
Yo, it's catching up.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.680
Look, there's the railroad crossing.
That's the way out, Billy.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.720
- You got it.
- You got it!

24:28.800 --> 24:30.006
I hope he has it.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.447
- He definitely doesn't have it.
- I got it! I got it!

25:03.520 --> 25:06.444
Storm's turned. It's gotten bad.
We're getting out of here.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.091
Let's go!

25:13.160 --> 25:14.730
Let's go!

25:16.000 --> 25:17.001
Pull it port!

25:18.120 --> 25:21.169
Pull up the net!

25:21.240 --> 25:23.322
Let's go, boys! Pull!

25:23.400 --> 25:25.129
A little more starboard!

25:25.200 --> 25:27.328
Let her go!

25:32.000 --> 25:33.001
What the hell is that?

25:33.080 --> 25:34.969
Get back!

25:40.840 --> 25:43.161
- Wide to the port! ...now!
- Yeah!

26:24.840 --> 26:27.366
Okay.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.200
Billy!
What's happening down there?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.201
What?

27:46.280 --> 27:48.328
- Where's your bodyguard?
- What are you doing?

27:48.400 --> 27:51.768
I'm just gonna quietly snap your wrist,
you little bitch.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.362
Oh, no, no, no. Oh... Okay.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.920
Billy Cranston

28:10.040 --> 28:12.805
just knocked Colt Wallace
out cold! Damn, Billy!

28:12.920 --> 28:14.763
What happened?
What happened?

28:14.880 --> 28:16.882
- I didn't see it!
- Hi, Billy.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.442
Hey. Come on, come on.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.766
- Am I crazy or this is crazy, right?
- It's crazy.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.922
We got hit by a train
and we're standing here.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.047
How is that possible?

28:30.120 --> 28:32.885
I don't remember getting home
from the mine at all.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.769
I slept all day yesterday.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.370
We gotta find Billy.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.205
You know I wasn't trying to start
any trouble or anything like that.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.721
And I say, "Hey, man, look,
I'm not a violent person.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.451
But if you must come at me,
come at me, bro."

28:45.520 --> 28:46.521
- Sweet!
- Yeah!

28:46.600 --> 28:48.284
Boom! Down goes douchebag.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.091
- Down goes... I... I can't say that word.
- Billy.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.327
Hey, Kimberly... Kimberly Hart.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.811
We need to talk.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.689
How... what?

29:01.040 --> 29:03.520
- Since when does he know Kimberly Hart?
- Billy's awesome.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.211
Nice hair.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.084
- Billy, look at me.
- Huh?

29:11.160 --> 29:12.650
Do you feel weird?

29:12.720 --> 29:14.722
You mean like weirder than usual?

29:14.800 --> 29:16.882
Yeah. Different.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.007
Oh.

29:21.040 --> 29:24.362
Listen, we know something
happened up there, okay?

29:24.440 --> 29:25.487
I'm not the same.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.800
Me either. Oh! I'm strong.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.281
- How strong?
- Like, insanely strong.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.364
I feel like we need
to go back up there.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.006
The counter's boiling.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.171
We're going back today.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.241
Yeah.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.282
Come on up.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.442
Oh, she's down here.

30:06.520 --> 30:07.760
So you're sure it's a woman?

30:07.840 --> 30:11.890
Not a great-looking woman.
Come see for yourself.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.486
Oh, that smell is... it's intense.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.050
You should make a note of that.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.203
Smell inside an old fishing boat
that holds tons of dead fish

30:20.280 --> 30:21.725
doesn't smell so good.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.841
Freaky, right?

30:23.840 --> 30:25.251
- Look, do you need us?
- No.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.880
All right, 'cause I need to get to bed.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.685
Lock up when you're done.
There's beers in the fridge.

30:40.680 --> 30:41.920
Jesus.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.321
Jesus.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.720
Unit two, this is Meinen.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.768
I have a body. A deceased female.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.124
Let's just keep going.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.251
Guys, look.
Look, it's that guy again.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.845
Find anything interesting?

31:23.840 --> 31:25.649
If I do, I'm keeping it!

31:25.720 --> 31:27.768
- We know why you're here.
- Oh, yeah?

31:28.880 --> 31:32.726
You guys wake up surprised to be alive
and jump over a house?

31:32.800 --> 31:35.406
Yeah. Kinda. Well... no.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.696
Look, we're different, all right?
Everything's different.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.529
Uh, you're Zack, right?

31:39.600 --> 31:41.090
Yup.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.162
You still go to Angel Grove?

31:43.240 --> 31:45.004
Ha! Sometimes!

31:46.080 --> 31:49.289
You know, the other girl was here too,
about an hour ago.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.806
Hey, you mean that girl right there?

31:51.880 --> 31:53.405
Hey! Come on down!

31:53.480 --> 31:56.211
We should figure this out together!

31:59.640 --> 32:02.564
- Whoa.
- Oh, screw this.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.416
- Okay, let me handle this.
- She got up there pretty fast.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.488
No, no, no!

32:11.360 --> 32:13.010
Yo, keep up.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.801
Stop!

32:28.560 --> 32:30.085
Just... just talk to me.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.604
You have a coin. We have a coin.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.320
We should just talk about this.
I mean, we don't know what this...

32:39.240 --> 32:41.322
- Whoa! Whoa!
- What is wrong with you?

32:43.520 --> 32:44.521
Whoa.

32:44.600 --> 32:48.207
Oh, you're crazy! But so am I.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.924
- Whoa, Zack.
- No, I got this.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.176
- Wait, wait.
- No, I got this.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.884
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:03.960 --> 33:05.644
Hey!

33:05.720 --> 33:08.121
- I got her!
- Get off of me.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.361
Just jump over.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.442
Let's go. Jump with me. Yeah.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.736
No, no, no! Don't-don't jump.
- Okay.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.576
- Don't jump. Don't jump.
- I'm gonna jump across with her,

33:14.600 --> 33:15.931
and then you jump, okay?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.096
- Piece o' cake.
- No, no, no!

33:17.120 --> 33:19.327
Don't, don't! Jason! Hey!

33:19.400 --> 33:21.243
That's not a piece o' cake!

33:31.800 --> 33:33.640
- You all right?
- Yeah, no problem.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.331
You got this, Billy!

33:36.400 --> 33:37.686
No, I don't!

33:37.760 --> 33:40.127
- It's fun.
- It's such a far jump.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.256
- Come on, let's go, dude.
- Billy, come on.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.376
- We all did it.
- Yeah,

33:42.400 --> 33:44.129
you'll be fine, I promise. Just jump.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.336
Come on, do it, dude. Let's go.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.976
The drop is probably
more than 100 feet,

33:47.000 --> 33:48.525
which means death is imminent.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.682
Okay, so if you die, Billy,
what's gonna happen?

33:50.760 --> 33:52.046
Okay, your mom'll be alone.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.976
But it's okay 'cause
she could find somebody else.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.296
But she couldn't,
'cause you love your mom

33:55.320 --> 33:56.576
- and you won't really...
- He's scared.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.696
He'll come across, he's fine.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.210
Okay. Okay.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.362
Visualize jumping across!

34:01.440 --> 34:03.096
- And then do it!
- Come on, you got this!

34:03.120 --> 34:04.360
Okay!

34:13.360 --> 34:14.521
Billy, you got this!

34:15.520 --> 34:16.726
Whoa! Oh, shit!

34:16.800 --> 34:18.040
Whoa!

34:19.520 --> 34:20.856
- Are you okay?
- I got it.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.936
- Come on, climb up. Climb up.
- I did it.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.096
- Billy, you got it.
- I did it!

34:23.120 --> 34:24.929
See, what'd we tell you, Billy?
You got it!

34:25.040 --> 34:26.405
Told you. See?

34:26.480 --> 34:27.891
- Whoo!
- Yes!

34:28.000 --> 34:29.570
Billy, right! Yeah!

34:29.639 --> 34:31.005
- Whoa!
- Billy!

34:31.080 --> 34:32.081
- Oh, my God!
- Billy!

34:32.159 --> 34:34.686
Billy!

34:34.800 --> 34:36.404
Billy!

34:36.480 --> 34:38.562
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Billy!

34:39.560 --> 34:41.766
- We just kill that dude?
- What do we do?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.889
No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.690
Hey, guys,
you gotta come down here!

34:47.760 --> 34:49.520
It's water! You gotta see this!

34:53.239 --> 34:56.050
Yo, all right!
I'll see you guys down there.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.610
Uh... bring that crazy girl.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.565
Come on, you guys, let's go! Whoo!

35:03.640 --> 35:04.687
Whoa!

35:10.680 --> 35:14.605
Uh, hey... could I get a sip
of your water?

35:15.680 --> 35:16.681
I'm dying.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.767
Okay. Just don't finish it.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.241
Thanks. And I'm really sorry.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.084
Sorry for what?

35:27.160 --> 35:28.286
Whoa!

35:38.800 --> 35:40.802
Yeah!

35:43.640 --> 35:45.529
Welcome to the club!

35:46.560 --> 35:48.562
'Sup, crazy girl?

35:48.640 --> 35:51.450
We gotta do that again.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.361
Oh, thank goodness.

35:56.920 --> 36:00.003
- Hey, guys. Guys!
- What?

36:00.080 --> 36:01.844
- Check out how we glow.
- Cool.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.287
- Oh, yeah!
- I like this.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.203
I'm blue!

36:06.280 --> 36:08.000
That's not my favorite color,
but it's cool.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.847
I'm black!

36:09.920 --> 36:11.524
- What?
- I am.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.568
No, you're not.

36:24.200 --> 36:28.125
Hey, guys. There's something down there.
Follow me.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.123
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.850
Jason, I'm sliding!

38:10.480 --> 38:12.209
- Hi.
- Again?

38:15.800 --> 38:17.768
Well, that is unusual.

38:22.480 --> 38:24.687
This just gets better and better.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.360
Do you feel that?

38:29.880 --> 38:31.644
There's something out here.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.370
The walls are shaking.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.681
Come on.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.645
That's impossible.

39:14.760 --> 39:17.525
This must have been here
for millions of years.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.206
I mean, look how the rock
has grown around it.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.440
I don't like this place.

39:26.720 --> 39:27.846
Hey, guys.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.765
Check it out.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.083
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.408
- Holy sh...
- Shh!

39:57.480 --> 40:00.848
- What? Think there's aliens in here?
- Just be quiet, Zack.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.610
It's so cold in here.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.370
Jason, is this real?

40:06.440 --> 40:08.408
Like, are we really in a spaceship
right now?

40:08.480 --> 40:10.801
I think so. Just... just breathe, okay?

40:10.880 --> 40:11.961
Okay.

40:12.040 --> 40:15.647
Hey. We've all seen enough.
Right? We should go now?

40:15.720 --> 40:17.370
What? We're gonna be famous!

40:17.440 --> 40:19.522
- What is wrong with you?
- Quiet!

40:20.680 --> 40:22.250
There's something here.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.409
Whoa!

40:28.480 --> 40:29.760
- Ah!
- What was that?

40:32.120 --> 40:33.121
Whoa.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.006
What's going on?

40:38.120 --> 40:39.776
- The stairs!
- Oh, my God!

40:39.800 --> 40:41.086
There's no way out.

40:41.160 --> 40:44.050
- Guys, guys, guys!
- Let's go! That way! Let's go! Let's go!

40:44.120 --> 40:45.929
- I'm going!
- Run!

40:56.480 --> 40:57.891
Come on, come on.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.131
Didi, I'm coming!

41:14.080 --> 41:16.731
You're real!

41:16.800 --> 41:19.326
Leave her alone!

41:22.200 --> 41:23.247
We will kill you.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.890
Kill me? How?

41:25.920 --> 41:27.081
There's five of us.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.456
Yes, I know! I've been waiting for you.

41:28.480 --> 41:32.121
Wait, where's the other guy?
One, two, three, four... oh! There he is.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.487
Oh, no, no, no!

41:37.560 --> 41:38.925
All of you.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.004
In a spaceship buried underground?
How long have you been waiting?

41:42.080 --> 41:44.287
- What's today? Monday?
- Yeah.

41:44.360 --> 41:45.930
Then 65 million years.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.163
I've been very lonely.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.370
You're all so young-looking.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.124
This has to do with the coins?

41:55.240 --> 41:56.366
Yes, yes, the coins!

41:56.440 --> 41:57.616
Different colors. Different kids.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.324
Different-colored kids!

41:59.400 --> 42:01.448
I'm so excited you're here!

42:03.280 --> 42:04.406
Turn around.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.406
Go on.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.331
No way.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.450
Proceed.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.204
Think this'll work.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.442
One, two, three, four, five.
Different colors.

42:21.520 --> 42:24.603
Guys, let's focus on getting out of here.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.603
Stay together,
and then when we see a chance...

42:26.680 --> 42:29.843
- We run like hell.
- Okay. And if we don't get a chance?

42:29.920 --> 42:31.081
Then we kill it.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.411
Shouldn't hurt, but let's see.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.209
Please, step into the footprints.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.456
No. We are not going to do that.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.881
Hey, question. Um, what are you?

42:40.960 --> 42:44.203
I'm Alpha 5,
an alphormic lorcaid persona android.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.806
- What? Yeah, I know.
- He said he's a Alpha 5...

42:46.880 --> 42:50.566
I'm a talking robot. You can trust me.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.367
Billy!

43:07.120 --> 43:08.565
What the hell?

43:13.480 --> 43:14.686
Okay.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.976
Why do you keep looking
at each other?

43:23.000 --> 43:24.445
Is that, like, a human thing?

43:24.520 --> 43:25.601
Fascinating.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.764
Oh, it's working!
This is great! It's working!

43:46.840 --> 43:48.376
Zordon, are you there? Zordon!

44:02.240 --> 44:03.401
Okay. Okay.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.528
Come on! Let's go! Move!

44:15.960 --> 44:17.007
Go, go, go!

44:25.520 --> 44:27.568
Come forward, please!

44:27.640 --> 44:29.608
Do we have a choice?

44:29.680 --> 44:30.920
Don't think so.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.367
Look! It's Zordon!

44:40.440 --> 44:41.726
What?

44:41.800 --> 44:44.690
Zordon, they don't know who you are.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.250
Come in! Come in!

44:46.320 --> 44:48.891
These are them?
They're so small.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.689
Funny, I said the same thing, actually.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.206
You mean to tell me
that the fate of the universe

44:53.280 --> 44:56.090
is placed in the hands
of these... these children?

44:56.160 --> 44:58.401
The universe? That's a big place.

44:58.480 --> 44:59.970
They're teenagers.

45:00.040 --> 45:02.281
Somewhere between infancy
and full maturity.

45:02.360 --> 45:05.489
- It's hard to explain, really. I don't...
- Show me the coins.

45:07.880 --> 45:10.042
The morphing grid is never wrong.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.010
If the power coins
have returned to the ship with these...

45:13.080 --> 45:14.081
Teenagers!

45:14.160 --> 45:15.889
With these teenagers,

45:15.960 --> 45:19.442
then these teenagers
are the Power Rangers.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.806
Power Rangers!

45:22.480 --> 45:23.481
What?

45:23.560 --> 45:25.688
Okay, quick question.

45:25.760 --> 45:27.569
Hello. Hate to interrupt.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.211
Did I just hear you say
we're Power Rangers?

45:30.280 --> 45:33.682
Yes. Yes. You are the Power Rangers.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.046
Any other questions?

45:35.120 --> 45:36.929
- No, I think I'm good.
- Good.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.970
I got a question.
Um... Hi, how you doing?

45:40.040 --> 45:42.884
Oh, okay... um, my name is Billy.
Billy Cranston.

45:42.960 --> 45:46.760
- Kids used to call me Billy Crams-tons...
- Billy! Stop.

45:46.840 --> 45:50.606
I'm sorry.
Uh... the images here in this sphere

45:50.680 --> 45:52.762
tell a history of the Power Rangers.

45:52.840 --> 45:56.686
Looks like the Power Rangers
were a team that protected life.

45:56.760 --> 46:00.401
And life is a bright light.
Or... a piece of light?

46:00.480 --> 46:02.562
Yes. Yes, very good, Billy.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.369
It is called the Zeo Crystal.

46:04.440 --> 46:06.016
Oh, I love this part.
This is good.

46:06.040 --> 46:08.691
And every planet
in the universe that has life

46:08.760 --> 46:11.081
has a piece of the crystal
buried inside it.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.456
Sixty-five million years ago,

46:12.480 --> 46:16.963
Zordon's team died defending the crystal
here in what is now Angel Grove.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.616
- The coins have chosen you five.
- Yes! I knew it!

46:19.640 --> 46:24.487
Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal
and life on earth.

46:24.560 --> 46:27.291
Because... we... are the Power Rangers?

46:27.360 --> 46:29.249
He's smart!

46:29.320 --> 46:31.687
I'm sorry, um, is this some kind of joke?

46:31.760 --> 46:33.649
Like, I'm standing here with a wet wedgie.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.041
My socks are soaked.
We're squishing around in here.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.849
We're talking to a wall. I mean, guys...

46:37.920 --> 46:39.888
Silence!

47:02.400 --> 47:05.961
<i>Dig! Dig, Goldar!</i>

47:32.840 --> 47:35.207
Sir, I'm detecting
elevated heart rates.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.123
They're... they're very scared.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.770
I don't understand.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.490
Why would you show us that nightmare?

47:40.560 --> 47:42.642
It's not a nightmare.
It's the future.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.688
- Was that for real?
- Felt like it.

47:44.760 --> 47:47.650
- And who was that woman?
- Her name is Rita Repulsa.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.603
She will create Goldar,

47:49.720 --> 47:52.803
a huge monster who will rip the crystal
from the earth,

47:52.880 --> 47:55.850
and all life on your planet will die.

47:55.920 --> 48:00.289
With the crystal, Rita will have the power
to create and destroy worlds.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.488
So, let me guess.

48:02.560 --> 48:05.291
You want us to kill this woman? R... Rita?

48:05.400 --> 48:06.526
Ay, ay, ay! Rita!

48:06.600 --> 48:08.011
She must be stopped.

48:08.080 --> 48:09.650
When is she coming?

48:09.720 --> 48:10.880
She's already here.

48:10.920 --> 48:12.729
My best guess is we have 11 months.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.009
Oh, I'm sorry, days. Days, 11 days.

48:16.120 --> 48:18.361
If we're the Power Rangers
and this is our ship,

48:18.440 --> 48:20.736
if I walk through that door right now,
will it open for me?

48:20.760 --> 48:22.125
Yes, of course.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.850
Let's go.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.176
Whoa, what you doing?

48:25.200 --> 48:28.090
No, no, no, come back!
No. No, please, don't leave.

48:28.160 --> 48:32.245
Jason, my ranger team died
defending the crystal from Rita.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.163
That's why I'm in this wall.

48:35.320 --> 48:37.129
How'd you know my name?

48:37.200 --> 48:40.409
Because it's you, Jason Scott.

48:40.520 --> 48:44.809
You are the leader.
You are the Red Ranger.

48:47.960 --> 48:51.248
Rita was a ranger, too. And my friend.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.242
But she betrayed us.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.448
Wanted more power.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.806
She lost her way.

48:57.880 --> 49:02.204
Now she is just pure evil.

49:02.280 --> 49:05.204
You must bring them back.
All of the rangers.

49:05.280 --> 49:07.681
You must train your team to stop Rita

49:07.760 --> 49:10.081
before she has the strength
to find the crystal.

49:10.160 --> 49:13.084
Okay. I'm leaving.

49:13.160 --> 49:17.404
- And I only speak for myself when I...
- No! You speak for all of them.

49:17.480 --> 49:20.689
You know that, deep down,
what I'm saying is true.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.603
You were born for this.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.201
You all waited.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.281
Even you.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.442
Who... exactly are you?

49:35.520 --> 49:37.284
Really? Now you're gonna ask me
who I am?

49:37.360 --> 49:39.362
- Look, her name is Didi.
- Trini.

49:39.440 --> 49:41.602
She's new at school.
Transferred in a month ago.

49:41.680 --> 49:42.856
We have English together, right?

49:42.880 --> 49:44.803
I've been at Angel Grove
for over a year now.

49:44.880 --> 49:47.406
We have biology together. Good talk.

49:47.480 --> 49:49.130
Wait, look...

49:49.200 --> 49:51.487
none of us really know each other, okay?

49:51.560 --> 49:52.561
But somehow...

49:52.640 --> 49:55.610
we were all in the same place
at the same time

49:55.720 --> 49:56.816
when Billy found those coins.

49:56.840 --> 49:59.241
- And...
- Wait, wait, wait! Can I ask a question?

50:00.240 --> 50:01.446
Are we really superheroes?

50:01.560 --> 50:04.291
Like are we more like
Iron Man or Spider-Man?

50:04.360 --> 50:05.856
'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider,

50:05.880 --> 50:07.176
but I feel really good,
you know, not as...

50:07.200 --> 50:10.522
All right, look, bro,
trust me, you're not a superhero.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.602
Why are you talking to us
like you're the boss now?

50:12.680 --> 50:15.763
Hey, hold up.
Can any of this Rita stuff be real?

50:15.840 --> 50:17.205
Can any of it be true?

50:17.280 --> 50:18.486
I don't know.

50:18.560 --> 50:21.291
But I know that the answer
to what's wrong with us

50:21.360 --> 50:23.283
and to what's happening to us...

50:24.280 --> 50:25.486
is here.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.602
So what are you saying?

50:30.680 --> 50:32.409
I think we gotta come back.

50:33.560 --> 50:35.085
I can't make you come back here.

50:35.160 --> 50:39.210
But 4:00 tomorrow... I'll be here.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.770
Hey, Jason, we don't... we don't...

50:44.440 --> 50:45.896
- That makes sense. That makes sense.
- Of course.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.126
I don't know

50:47.200 --> 50:49.280
why I didn't think about
that one in the first place.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.490
So where were you today?

51:33.560 --> 51:35.801
Were you with friends?
Do you have any friends?

51:35.880 --> 51:37.616
- Why are you so tired...
- Okay, this is the problem.

51:37.640 --> 51:39.696
You ask her four questions before
she's even answered the first.

51:39.720 --> 51:43.202
Because she's like a ghost around here.
She needs to start communicating.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.567
- June...
- Say something.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.244
- Speak! I just...
- Relax.

51:47.320 --> 51:49.322
Okay. Relax.

51:50.880 --> 51:52.609
Okay, Trini, let's start over.

51:53.600 --> 51:55.523
Please tell us one thing you did today.

51:58.400 --> 52:01.847
Me and four kids from Angel Grove
found a spaceship buried underground.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.160
What?

52:04.600 --> 52:06.682
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.246
Cool.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.606
Not cool.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.808
Pee in that cup!

52:17.960 --> 52:20.440
This to remind me of my screw-up?

52:20.520 --> 52:24.570
No. Wrecking yard
only offered me 300 bucks for it and...

52:27.160 --> 52:29.686
you know, the frame's straight
and the engine still runs.

52:30.880 --> 52:33.804
Figure I'd leave it up to you to decide
if you wanted to fix it.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.365
Oh, shit.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.683
Mr. Scott,
there's been an incident on your boat.

52:46.760 --> 52:50.242
It's a terrible situation.
You gotta come with me.

52:50.320 --> 52:53.608
<i>A series of grisly crime
scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet</i>

52:53.680 --> 52:55.682
<i>of Angel Grove reeling.</i>

52:56.880 --> 52:59.136
<i>- Bodies were discovered...</i>
- I'm building Goldar for you...

52:59.160 --> 53:02.130
<i>This rash of violence
has the town on edge.</i>

53:07.640 --> 53:10.166
Goldar's coming.
Goldar's coming.

53:10.240 --> 53:14.131
Goldar's coming. Goldar's coming.

53:14.200 --> 53:15.690
What the hell you doing?

53:15.760 --> 53:21.290
I need gold.
I will build my beautiful Goldar.

53:21.360 --> 53:25.604
Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal.
I take the universe.

53:27.160 --> 53:29.447
Me, too!

54:03.240 --> 54:05.925
- What's up, crazy girl?
- Hey.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.365
Shall we do this?

54:08.360 --> 54:10.169
You need
to follow the three rules

54:10.240 --> 54:11.924
to being a Power Ranger.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.651
You must never use your powers
for personal gain.

54:14.720 --> 54:18.964
You must never escalate a fight,
unless your enemy forces you to.

54:19.040 --> 54:22.328
And you must never reveal
your identity. Ever.

54:22.400 --> 54:25.563
To assume your ranger identities,
you need to morph.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.722
Have any of you morphed before?

54:27.800 --> 54:30.883
Yes. But only in the shower.

54:30.960 --> 54:33.804
Okay, okay. Let's step
into the footprints, please.

54:33.880 --> 54:35.166
Let's try this.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.004
Standing in this circle as a team,

54:40.080 --> 54:42.128
you can easily connect
to the morphing grid.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.123
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, they do.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.123
No. Not feeling it.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.282
You need to morph
to get your armor.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.728
I knew it!
We do get armor.

54:51.800 --> 54:54.087
Jason! We get armor! Oh, we get armor.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.401
Cool. When do you give us the armor?

54:56.520 --> 54:58.841
You already have it
inside of you.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.496
You bring it out
by connecting to each other

55:00.520 --> 55:02.761
and connecting to the morphing grid.

55:02.840 --> 55:06.481
Clear your minds and focus.

55:06.560 --> 55:11.726
Power Rangers were a legion of warriors
sworn to protect life.

55:11.800 --> 55:12.847
Yes!

55:12.920 --> 55:15.571
You must become those warriors.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.290
Become the warriors!

55:25.320 --> 55:27.561
What?

55:27.640 --> 55:29.529
What? What, did it... did it work?

55:29.600 --> 55:31.443
Alpha 5, why didn't they morph?

55:31.520 --> 55:34.967
Yeah, I don't... I don't know, sir.
It's... it's disturbing.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.202
Very disturbing.
This might take some time.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.566
We don't have time.

55:38.640 --> 55:41.405
If they can't morph,
what are we supposed to do?

55:41.480 --> 55:42.856
They'll have to train
without armor.

55:42.880 --> 55:46.487
- They need to prepare.
- Without armor?

55:46.560 --> 55:47.766
Sir, that'll be very painful.

55:47.840 --> 55:49.410
Take them down to the pit.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.651
All right, follow me.
We're going to the pit!

55:53.720 --> 55:55.563
Jason, I don't wanna find out
what the pit is.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.530
So this is the pit. It's nice, right?

55:58.600 --> 56:00.443
<i>Alpha 5, begin the exercise.</i>

56:00.520 --> 56:02.010
Uh... sorry, guys.

56:02.080 --> 56:04.003
- What exercise?
- Chill out, dude.

56:08.600 --> 56:10.807
<i>These creatures before you</i>

56:10.880 --> 56:12.564
<i>are a simulation of Rita's army.</i>

56:12.680 --> 56:13.966
<i>They're called Putties.</i>

56:14.040 --> 56:16.361
<i>You must get through them to get to her.</i>

56:16.440 --> 56:17.680
No, no, no, no, Jason.

56:17.760 --> 56:20.923
Cool. Look, relax, guys. It's a hologram.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.923
Like a video game. Look.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.604
Whoa!

56:24.680 --> 56:26.762
That's a strong-ass hologram.

56:28.360 --> 56:29.930
Not a video game.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.606
<i>This is why you must morph
into your armor.</i>

56:32.680 --> 56:35.604
<i>If Rita becomes strong enough
to build her army,</i>

56:35.680 --> 56:37.842
<i>it'll be the beginning of the end.</i>

56:37.920 --> 56:40.366
<i>Rangers, welcome to training.</i>

56:40.440 --> 56:42.216
I'm so excited you guys are back.

56:42.240 --> 56:44.720
Aim for the center mass.

56:44.800 --> 56:45.961
One more time.

56:46.040 --> 56:48.008
Come on, duck the punches.
Find their weak side.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.208
Oh...

56:50.280 --> 56:52.567
Let's go a couple o' hits, okay?
Hit one...

56:52.640 --> 56:53.687
No, let's try it again.

56:53.760 --> 56:54.976
Now this is exciting.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.726
Yeah, Trini!

56:59.360 --> 57:00.566
<i>Hai!</i>

57:00.640 --> 57:01.687
Ready, master Billy?

57:03.560 --> 57:06.006
You need to learn the element of surprise.

57:06.080 --> 57:08.208
Ready? Let's go again.

57:08.320 --> 57:10.084
All right, Billy, lighter on your feet.

57:11.800 --> 57:12.801
Hands up.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.686
Play with some energy now!
Let's go!

57:30.000 --> 57:32.526
Focus! Focus!
Everybody just focus!

57:36.040 --> 57:37.166
Lucky shot.

57:39.440 --> 57:41.568
You guys all know
you could be murdered, right'?

57:55.560 --> 57:56.607
No.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.244
<i>You must shed
your masks to wear this armor.</i>

58:05.560 --> 58:06.800
I don't feel anything.

58:08.280 --> 58:09.884
Take them down to the pit.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.200
Now watch me...

58:11.280 --> 58:14.329
slip, grab, lift.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.401
Yeah!

58:15.480 --> 58:17.687
Slip, grab, lift!

58:19.720 --> 58:20.721
Yes!

58:39.640 --> 58:42.211
<i>Think only of each other,</i>

58:42.280 --> 58:44.248
<i>and the morphing grid will open to you.</i>

58:45.240 --> 58:46.526
Is it working?

58:46.600 --> 58:47.761
No, it's not.

58:47.840 --> 58:49.251
Come on! Try harder!

58:50.440 --> 58:51.851
<i>Let's just concentrate.</i>

58:51.920 --> 58:53.720
<i>I've been concentrating
though, Jason.</i>

58:53.800 --> 58:55.376
<i>'Cause we haven't been
concentrating...</i>

58:55.400 --> 58:56.536
<i>all we need to do is just concentrate.</i>

58:56.560 --> 58:58.005
Don't tell me to concentrate.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.206
Just follow my lead.

58:59.280 --> 59:00.456
Let's not fight with each other.

59:00.480 --> 59:02.164
<i>Zack, now is not the time.</i>

59:05.200 --> 59:07.282
Come on. Let's go train.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.569
The information we need to triangulate

59:10.640 --> 59:13.928
the location of the crystal
was lost in the battle. So...

59:14.000 --> 59:15.729
Billy, are you listening to me?

59:15.800 --> 59:16.840
Billy, what are you doing?

59:16.880 --> 59:19.247
Billy!

59:19.320 --> 59:23.166
Where's the crystal?
Find it, Billy, find it.

59:23.240 --> 59:24.969
Where's the crystal?

59:25.080 --> 59:26.241
There.

59:26.320 --> 59:29.483
One, two... Okay, 17 degrees north...

59:29.560 --> 59:31.562
Hey, idiot,
watch where you're going!

59:31.640 --> 59:33.280
- One, two, three...
- Wake up!

59:40.920 --> 59:42.416
<i>Two fishermen
were laid to rest today</i>

59:42.440 --> 59:44.283
<i>at Saint Andrew's Cemetery.</i>

59:44.360 --> 59:47.170
<i>Residents of Angel Grove
are feeling the shock.</i>

59:47.240 --> 59:49.720
<i>Fear has the town on edge.</i>

59:49.800 --> 59:52.326
<i>This series of murders has police baffled</i>

59:52.440 --> 59:55.808
<i>as police have linked the loss of gold
to each crime scene.</i>

59:55.880 --> 59:58.804
<i>What is now being dubbed
"Angel Grove's Gold Killer"</i>

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.120
<i>is still on the loose.</i>

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.245
...Rita manages to create Goldar...
Are you listening to me?

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.376
And he rips the crystal from the ground,

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.847
it'll be like 10,000 nuclear bombs
washing over Earth.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.240
Supposed to freak us out?

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.408
You keep making this harder.
We're busting our asses.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.160
Feel free to throw us a bone
at some point.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.885
Yes, I see you busting your "asses."

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.531
So I've decided
to give you some inspiration.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.969
What you will find beyond this wall
will forever change your lives.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.280
Come on.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.324
The Zords!

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.930
- Pretty cool, right'?
- Yeah.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.001
They take on the form

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.048
of the most powerful organism
on the planet.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.250
When these Zords formed,
dinosaurs reigned supreme.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.721
They will be an extension of you.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.804
And their power... is all but limitless.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.367
But you're not ready for this power.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.441
When you morph,

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.330
your armor will make you one
with the Zords.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.289
So come on, let's go train.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.250
Today's the day you become rangers!
I can feel it!

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.081
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.561
Yeah. Let's go.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.201
This was a bad idea.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.607
Okay, okay, uh, signals, brakes.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.841
Brakes, I need brakes!

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.888
Manual. Man-u-al.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.123
Where are the brakes... Alpha 5!

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.250
Ahh! Oh, crap!

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.687
Hey! Move! Move!

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.000
Out of the way!

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.442
<i>♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪</i>

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.856
You have to remember
that in today's training lesson

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.291
the important thing is to...

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.011
- Wait. Where's Zack?
- Seriously?

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.808
Run, run, run! Run!

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.048
Run! Run!

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.365
It's bad!

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.161
You all right?

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.404
Ay, ay, ay!

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.450
All right, my bad, my bad.
That's on me, right there.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.851
What's your problem?

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.008
You could've killed yourself. Or us.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.650
- Back off, bossman.
- Hey!

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.086
Oh, come on, guys. Wow.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.696
- Guys, guys, guys, come on!
- Watch it!

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.324
Wait. What are you doing?

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.330
Just stop fighting, please!

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.486
What?

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.483
That's dope.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.562
What? I got something on my f...

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.768
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.684
Okay, now that's cool! Oh, yeah!

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.216
- Hold still.
- Don't touch it. Zack, don't touch it.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.571
Zack, do not touch it.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.730
Whoa!

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.007
Where'd it go? Bring it back.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.242
Bring it back, dude.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.321
<i>Get out.</i>

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.483
<i>Training is over for today. Go home.</i>

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.927
I'm sorry, he just morphed.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.331
He did it. You saw it, right?

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.561
<i>Do it again.</i>

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.961
<i>All of you. Any of you.</i>

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.442
- Billy. How'd you do it, Billy?
- Come on, Billy, let's do it.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.960
- Show us what you did.
- Come on. Do it again.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.290
- Do it again!
- I'm trying, I'm trying! I can't focus!

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.409
Billy, how'd you do it? Show us.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.764
Okay, we don't know how.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.285
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.126
<i>If you can't morph, you are not rangers.</i>

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.407
<i>Go home. All of you.</i>

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.201
Now what?

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.327
Damn.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.164
Seriously?

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.721
Hey, guys...

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.883
guys, look, uh...
I'ma stay up here tonight.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.170
Make a fire. I got some food
if you guys wanna stay.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.886
I'm down.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.561
All right. Cool.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.725
Jason's team is failing.
I shall destroy Rita myself.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.531
There must be a way to free me
from this wall.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.447
Yes, but the irony is,
is that you need these rangers to morph.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.522
If they morph, you can harness that energy

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.001
to regenerate your body
and come back through.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.321
There's got to be
another way! I can't...

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.641
What, Zordon? You can't what?

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.446
Wait for us dumb kids to morph
so that you can come back to life?

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.329
That's what all this
has been about, right?

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.084
You coming back?

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.209
This has only ever been
about protecting the crystal.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.203
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.887
- Don't underestimate me or my team.
- You can't stop him.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:53.091
She will have him dig up the crystal
and life on earth will die.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.201
And we need you.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.376
Because you were so successful
at stopping her last time.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.370
I died burying those coins

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.808
in hopes that they would find
the next real rangers.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.048
Those who are worthy.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.884
Well, sorry to disappoint you.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.884
I don't need to stand here
and have you tell me what I did wrong.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.887
- I can go home and get that.
- Jason, you need me out of this wall.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.724
To help lead this team!

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.928
Your team's dead.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.161
And you're just as scared as we are.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.964
These... are all 24 karat gold bands.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.776
Hello, I'll be right with you.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.485
They're at the top of your budget...

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.087
I'll get you anything you want.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.004
Aw. You're so sweet.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.809
Get my cookie anything she wants.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.124
I'll be right back.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.087
Uh... can I help you?

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.806
Gold.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.003
I'm interested...

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.081
in gold.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.121
Yeah.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.171
We have some very nice pieces here.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.889
Come closer.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.167
- Closer. Closer. Closer.
- Oh...

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.041
- This. Give it to me!
- Of course!

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.485
Okay. Here you go.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.565
Ah...

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.401
Grow.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.291
Grow.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.961
More!

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.096
Police! Don't move!

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.681
Drop your... weapon,
and put your hands on your head.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.807
Do it now!

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.524
Do what I say, lady!

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.161
Lady... I like the sound of "lady."

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.016
Get on the ground
and you won't get hurt.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.171
Unit five, I need backup
at Fenix Jewelers.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.766
Shots fired. I repeat, shots fired.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.241
Get down!

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.281
It's been too long
since I raised my beautiful creatures.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.767
Did you miss me?

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.684
Oh, my God.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.569
Kill him!

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.856
All right.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.291
If I weren't stuck in this wall,

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.641
I would eat that junk food!

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.569
What happened back there?

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.529
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.203
Billy, how'd you do it?

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.564
How'd you morph?

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.323
I don't know.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:33.448
What are you guys thinking about
when we're trying to morph?

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.206
You must shed
your masks to wear this armor.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.803
Think only of each other

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.928
and the morphing grid will open to you.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.081
Yeah, that's better.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:49.091
Well, maybe it's because
we don't know each other.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.810
Maybe that's why we can't morph.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.564
Okay.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.962
No, I'm serious. Let's do this. For real.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.609
- What?
- I'm Zack.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.001
And I am a Power Ranger.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.720
Hi, Zack.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:11.930
Truth: I live
in the Melody Mobile Home Park.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.246
It's just me and my mom.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.924
And my mom?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.889
My mom is the best!

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.162
But my mom, she's sick.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.729
I do what I can, but...

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.081
but I'm scared.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.050
Sometimes I get too scared
to stay there at night, 'cause...

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.890
'cause I'm afraid she can't make it.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.363
And if she goes...

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:43.770
when she goes,

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.890
I got nobody else.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:55.922
Look, I think
being with you guys is good for me.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.361
Let's do that.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.522
Let's tell our secrets.
It'll... it'll help us.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.806
Okay, I got a secret.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.130
- I like country music.
- What?

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.929
No, matter of fact, I love country music.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.566
And I don't...

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.971
I don't miss my dad as much.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.808
I mean, coming to the mine
with him was all I had.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.648
But coming to the mine
with you guys is just as good.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.449
Yeah.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.761
Bigger secret is why
were you in detention?

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.888
- I blew up my lunchbox.
- What?

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.247
What, it was a accident, okay?

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.164
- Of course.
- My lunchbox was in my locker.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.641
Boom goes the lunchbox,
in detention goes Billy.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.645
But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart
was also in... in detention, too, so...

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.006
Not tonight.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.321
Skip me.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.681
What about you, dude?

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.842
Why don't you tell us
who you really are?

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.241
Because everyone knows exactly who I am.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.806
Okay.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.006
What about you, crazy girl?

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.209
I could tell you anything
and you'd have to believe me.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.447
Okay, um...

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.683
I'm the new girl. Always.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.362
Three schools in three years.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.570
What's crazy is I like it that way.
You know, it's just easier.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.086
Nobody ever has to
get to know me and uh,

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.642
my parents don't have to worry
about my relationships.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.810
Boyfriend troubles?

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.885
Yeah. Boyfriend troubles.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.085
Girlfriend troubles?

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.642
My family is so normal.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.881
Too normal.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.684
They believe in labels.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.608
They'd like for me to, um...
dress differently.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.251
Talk more.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.885
Have the kind of friends
they want me to have.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.287
It's just... I don't know how to tell them
what's really going on with me.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.491
And I've never said any of this out loud.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.723
Well, it's cool. You're with us now.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.441
Am I?

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.611
What does that mean?

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.364
When all this is over.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.524
Are we Power Rangers or...

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.564
are we friends?

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.964
Do you know who I am?

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.325
Yes.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.802
I was once just like you.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.406
So pretty.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.926
Innocent

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.210
Are all the rangers on Zordon's new team
as young as you?

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.405
Delightful!

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.850
Have you morphed yet?

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.850
Trick question.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.048
If you could morph,

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.284
we'd be having
a very different conversation.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.724
Mmm. The Yellow Ranger.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.768
Should I kill you?

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.606
I killed the Yellow Ranger... before.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.411
And I loved it!

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.211
Oh, you want your armor.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.330
I'll show you mine,
if you show me yours.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.449
No, please, you're hurting me!
You're so strong!

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.808
I'm just kidding.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.886
You've got spunk, little Yellow.

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.485
I see myself in you.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.485
I was an outsider on Zordon's
team just like you.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.361
All I need to know is,
where is the Zeo Crystal?

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.568
I don't know.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.971
Sadly, I believe you.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.170
Tomorrow, I am going to destroy
Angel Grove.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.766
But, in exchange for your life,

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.925
you will find out where that crystal is,
and you will come to me.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.650
We can have a little deal,

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.768
Didi, my friend.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.688
- Shh! It's me.
- Kim.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.524
How did you get in here?

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.729
I'm a superhero.
And you left your window open.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.290
Is everything okay?

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.281
I think I'm the reason we can't morph.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.283
I haven't really been honest.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.284
Okay. I punched Ty Fleming in the face

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:42.285
because he told everyone
I was the meanest person he'd ever met.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.486
And he was right.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.931
Well, that can't be true.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.650
Okay.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.889
Whoa.

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.122
- You took that picture?
- No.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.409
Amanda Clark took that picture.
Of herself.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.724
But she shared it with me.
Privately. She trusted me.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.246
And you sent that pic to... to Ty?

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.846
With a text that said,

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.896
"Is this the girl you wanna
bring home to your mom?"

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.445
Oh.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.683
I didn't realize how mean
it was until I saw her face.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.889
Kim, there's literally thousands of photos
going around school.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.010
I don't care about them.
I care about this. I did this.

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.924
I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's
office with Amanda's father

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.004
and watch as they showed him
that photo of his daughter.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.686
In his eyes, for the first time,
I could see who I'd become.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:34.526
You know, so I lied.
I blamed everyone else.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.569
I wanted to die, that's why...

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.689
that's why when you asked me to run away,
I was ready.

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.685
Okay, listen. Start over.
Erase that picture right now.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.684
- Jason, it can't be erased.
- Then live with it.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.411
You did an awful thing.
It doesn't make you an awful person.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.162
Just be the person you wanna be.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.526
So, we all got the same text.
So where is she?

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.051
I'm here.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.930
Look, Rita came to my house tonight.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.650
- What?
- Yeah. She's real...

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.490
insane.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.324
She nearly killed me.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.880
She was trying to get me to join her.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.122
She said she'd spare my life,
if I could keep a secret.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.201
What secret?

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.409
At dawn, the destruction
of Angel Grove begins.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.608
This is real. This is the end.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:38.841
No, it's not. Where is she?

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.002
She said to meet her
where the dead ships live.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.924
Okay. That's the boatyard
by the docks, right?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.160
- Let's go.
- What?

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.807
Are you serious? No one?

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.609
Jason, we're not even Power Rangers yet.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.330
I say we go back to Zordon.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.161
Okay, the only reason Zordon
wanted us to become Power Rangers

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.969
is so that he can come back to life.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.166
What makes you say that?

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.850
Because he told me.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.570
Wait, so this all is a lie?

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.449
Of course it was a lie, Billy.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.760
We failed.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:13.731
Let's stop being delusional
about being a team of superheroes.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.280
We're all screw-ups.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.682
And as much as I hate this scrubby,
bullshit town,

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.889
I don't wanna just sit around
and watch it die, okay?

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.691
Let's go and do the one thing
that's been asked of us

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.125
and kill Rita.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.280
You know this is a really bad idea, right?

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.725
The worst.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.565
Let's vote. Show of hands.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.446
Let's do it.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.051
Okay. Okay, let's go.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.336
Take the left,
I'll take the right.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.850
Okay. Got it.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.044
- We'll, untie him. Hold this.
- No, no, no.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.441
Let's just think about this, okay?

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.760
Oh, shit!

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.403
Right on time.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.607
I was beginning to think
you were too dumb

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.921
to know where the dead ships live.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.440
Let's play.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.967
Five little rangers tied up like fish.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:40.322
The leader? Oh, hello, Red.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.880
Oh!

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.486
You're not entirely disappointing.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:49.406
Oh, look at you.
Trying to figure out my plan.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.686
I'll just tell you.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.162
Yellow has led you to your deaths.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.891
Because I'm going to kill you,

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:02.124
one by one, until you tell me,

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.725
where is my crystal?

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.165
We don't know.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:08.403
No, Red. You don't know!

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.369
But guess what?

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.283
One of you does.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.123
Who could it be?

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.806
Eenie, meenie, miney...

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.126
Blue.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.043
Blue, so loyal.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.281
Pure of heart.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.483
Tell the class what you know!

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.040
Where's my crystal?

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.525
You can tell me now, Blue,

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.605
or you can tell me after I kill
all of your friends.

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.561
Let's start with Black.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.722
No! Stop!

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:47.847
No.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.006
He dies in three, two...

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.730
Okay! Okay!

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.296
Don't hurt my friends, all right?

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.288
It's at a dining establishment.

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.931
Where? What does that mean?
What's it called?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.240
It's a Krispy Kreme.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.005
- Krispy Kreme?
- Krispy Kreme.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.366
This is a special place?

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.727
- Very special.
- It must be.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.326
The source of life itself is buried there.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:17.961
Thank you, Blue, for being so weak.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:22.284
Zordon would lose all respect
for me if I don't kill you.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.203
- At least one of you.
- What?

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.764
No! Billy!

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.640
- Billy!
- Billy!

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.724
- Jason, we gotta help him!
- Billy! Billy!

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.769
You're not ready to kill me.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.007
Ha! You're not worthy.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.570
Quick! Get the rope!

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.401
Billy!

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.121
Billy?

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.406
He's gonna be okay, right?

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.331
Come on.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.563
Hey, hey. You got this, big guy. Come on.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.480
He's dead.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.685
He's dead.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.000
No.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.406
Pick him up.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.849
Help me pick him up!

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.601
Come on!

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:21.001
Okay. Okay. Come on, Billy.
We got you, buddy.

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.048
Take him. Take him.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.766
Yeah.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.923
- Let's just put him down.
- Okay.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.922
- Slow, slow, slow.
- Master Billy.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.684
Do something, okay?

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.256
There must be something
you can do for him.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.681
I told you that you were not ready.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.924
Zordon, please help us, okay? Please.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.002
There's nothing that I could do for him.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.806
We were both reckless with our teams.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.486
No.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.971
I'm sorry.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.686
I'm sorry, guys.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.922
He's dead because of me.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.964
No, Jason, it was all of us.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.646
No, I pushed it.

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.326
And as usual I made the wrong decision.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.368
Out of... out of fear, anger...

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.600
I don't know, I was just so angry.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.727
He's... he's a great kid, you know?

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.164
And he loved us.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.210
He loved... being a ranger.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.450
I'm sorry, Billy.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.760
I'd trade my life for yours if I could.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.767
Maybe he traded his life for us.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.609
Yeah. Probably did.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.291
I would.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.246
Me too.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.090
Yeah. Me too.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.086
Me too.

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.445
It's just the four of us now.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.080
The truth is,

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:54.090
whatever we've said to each other,

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.241
it doesn't matter.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.681
This. This is the only thing that matters.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.765
She's right.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.886
Zordon! Zordon!
Look at the grid!

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.691
This is your time! Do... do you see it?

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.683
The grid is open! Step through!

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.604
Yes, I see it. I see it.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.646
Step through, Zordon!

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:29.127
- Hey!
- What's happening?

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.929
The morphing grid is open!

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.889
What's going on?

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.524
Zordon? Master?

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.601
Where is he?

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.808
He must have
stepped through the grid.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.370
Alpha, where'd he go?

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.851
I don't know where he is.

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.724
Zordon, what?
Why didn't you step though?

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.325
That was your only chance.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.481
I know.

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.165
But only one can come back.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.005
Billy!

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.129
- Billy!
- Oh, my God! Hey!

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.846
Are you okay?

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.131
- Did I die?
- Yes.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.480
- No.
- Little bit.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.289
And you guys brought me back to life.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.604
I told you we were superheroes.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.331
There can only be one Red Ranger.

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.166
Jason, this is your time.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.971
This is your team.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.087
Thank you.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.563
Dude. That was loopy.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.205
Seein' my dad.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.489
Welcome back, my friend.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.327
- Oh, we gotta go to Krispy Kreme, Jason.
- What?

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.606
Not for donuts.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.090
Okay. Let's try this.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.045
Thank you, Zordon.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.688
It's morphin' time.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.162
Who is that?

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.640
Oh, my God!

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.251
Yes.

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.045
Come back to me, Goldar.

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.643
Come back.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.282
Hold up. Look.

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:08.888
All right. Let's do this.

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.806
Yes!

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.766
Yee-haw!

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.683
Whoa, this is so much better with armor.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.361
Come on! Bring it on!

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.126
Hey, heads up!

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.163
Guys, they just keep coming.

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.924
There's too many of them.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.176
You guys hold them off.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.770
Zack, where are you going?

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:15.887
Whoo-hoo!

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:22.008
Make my monster grow!

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.766
I've missed you, my friend.

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.256
They're gonna push us
off the edge!

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.930
Incoming!

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.041
Let's kill everyone.

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.205
Did you guys see that?

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.091
All right, who wants me
to pimp their ride, too?

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:04.047
Uh, guys? We're too late.

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.521
Oh, man.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:12.082
That's... that's a lotta gold.

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.731
We're gonna
protect the crystal, right?

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.766
- We're going to Angel Grove.
- Let's get the Zords.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.202
This is a lot different than the van.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.204
Whoo!

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.328
Yippie-kay-yay, motherfu...

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.084
Mother's good. Mother's good.

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.764
Go, go, Power Rangers!

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:45.536
I'm not going
the right way! What?

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.891
Jason, I'm going backwards.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.729
Guys... our town. She's destroying it.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.928
Krispy Kreme!

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.570
Not there.

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.404
Rita and her golden boy
haven't found Krispy Kreme yet.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.856
Okay, Kim,
you hold them there.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.884
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme
and make sure it's safe.

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.200
I'm headed straight for Goldar.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.760
Copy! I'll hold her off.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.640
Kim, I'll go with you.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.165
Let's go, boys.

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.696
Billy, just the two of us.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.370
I'm right behind you.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:24.721
Oops.

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.926
Surprise.

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.530
How cute.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.446
The rangers found their costumes
and their dino-cars.

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.444
Well, let's give them something else
to play with.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.645
Crush them!

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.484
How many does she need?

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.800
This is insane.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.600
Take that!

01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:18.842
Okay. Let's try this!

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.486
Sorry, Bumblebee! Whoo!

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.561
Yeah!

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.290
I can't get 'em off!

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.124
Turn your head. Trust me.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.163
Okay. Thanks, Kim.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.526
That's all right.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.131
That's what you get.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.560
Whoo!

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.170
The crystal.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.966
She just found the crystal.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.247
Okay, come on, let's move!

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.096
I'll take Goldar
from the right.

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.043
J! I'm right behind you.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.451
Come on!

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.046
Jason, it's your dad.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.724
I'm looking for you. I'm downtown.

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:43.848
I'm at Mariner Bay and Reefside.

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.008
Call me back soon as you get this.

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.601
How's that feel?

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.889
We got this. Come on!

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.800
- No!
- No!

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.966
I'm coming!

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.485
Ahh!

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.885
Help!

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.041
Give me your hand.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.326
Help!

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:55.371
- Sam! Look at me.
- Huh?

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.169
It's okay.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.805
Give me your hand.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.526
Dig. Dig, Goldar.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.844
Me and Zack are gonna try
to push Goldar to the water.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.201
We're okay.
I'm okay. Go.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:33.761
Guys, help!

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.650
Billy, I have an idea. Ready?

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.200
Uh... Yeah? For what exactly?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.490
Oh-ho-ho!

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.610
I don't know what to press, okay?

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.367
Open wide, Rita.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:02.206
Let me try...

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.289
Hey, Billy, you okay?

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.486
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.846
That was crazy brave, dude.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:38.365
Did we do it?

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.761
Did we... did we win?

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.080
Yeah!

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.604
I feel the crystal.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:16.966
She's back.

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.926
That's incredible.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.764
Oh, my God.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.966
Come on, let's go!

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.120
Okay, everyone.

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.210
Hold the line.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.490
Okay.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.925
We got this.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.490
Come on!

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.804
Crush them!

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.405
Okay, fire!

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.206
Yeah!

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:22.290
Come on, guys!

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.081
Ohh!

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.566
If you must come at me...
come at me, bro!

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.005
Watch out! Billy!

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.721
Okay.

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.683
Yes!

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.122
Jason, I'm coming in.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.123
Kim! I got your back.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.841
I got you.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.967
I'm burning.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.811
I can't... I can't breathe.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.208
He's crushing me!

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.328
Push them into the pit!

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.616
Guys, we're sliding!

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.962
- Come on, everybody, hold the line!
- Fight back!

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.576
It's getting too hot, guys.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:44.280
I don't know how much longer
I can hold it.

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.246
No one dies alone.

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.845
I'm okay with that.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:05.491
Hold the line. Hold the line.

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:07.760
Hold the line.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.842
Zack! Zack, stay with me,
Zack. Come on.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.009
Thank you for being my friends.

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.844
Hold on to each other.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.323
Get my crystal!

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.211
We're alive.

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.563
Guys, we're alive!

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.564
We're like one big, uh... one big Zord.
Like a mama Zord.

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.689
- What?
- No, no, no. That sounds lame. Um...

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:47.761
a Megazord!

01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.041
How?

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.407
Whoa.

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:25.281
What?

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:33.888
Oh, shit.

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.530
Bring it on.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.489
Everyone, let's go!

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.449
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:49.242
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no!

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.536
That might
have been my fault. I'm sorry, y'all.

01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:53.976
I think Kimberly
needs to move our feet.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.606
- No, I've got the arm.
- Uh, no, I do. I've got the leg.

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.529
- You're a leg, too?
- I have the arm.

01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.210
We all have to move together.

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.645
I'll lift us.

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:06.802
All together on three.

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:10.680
One, two, three!

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:11.896
We got this! Come on!

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.730
Zack, catch us.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:25.120
Let's go again!

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.567
Kimberly, throw a hook! Now!

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:31.401
Whoo!

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:36.216
Oh, I wish I could punch.

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.689
Nice one, Billy!

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:52.285
Jason, we got anything for that?

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:54.209
Remember the pit?

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.810
Yeah.

01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:56.881
Hey, I hate the pit!

01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.571
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.529
- Ready.
- Ready.

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.409
Ready.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:07.481
Now!

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.481
Slip!

01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:13.844
Grab!

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:16.649
Lift!

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.486
Kim, Trini,
pull back on the arms.

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.324
We've got swords.

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:43.926
Ha!

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.282
Wait!

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.611
Guys...

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.243
Look at me.

01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.450
You think you've won?

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.205
I came for the crystal.

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.760
Others will come!

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:10.731
What you have... it can't last.

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.403
You know I'm right!

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:17.529
- No.
- No.

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:20.285
<i>I don't know. But for now,</i>

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.011
<i>I need you to give your staff
and your coin to us.</i>

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:26.721
And we'll take you to Zordon
and let him be the judge.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.771
Zordon? Judge me?

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.689
Never!

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:38.321
No matter what Zordon says,

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:42.371
I know I am worthy!

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:46.725
Trini! Now!

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.410
Jason, did you just slap her?

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.131
I did. Weird, right?

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.210
That's cool.

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.441
I guess the bully...

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:17.286
you guys don't get...
It's the... I got it, buddy.

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.408
Oh, that was scary.

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:27.205
We did it.

01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:47.925
I told you we'd be famous.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.331
Is that Principal Feig?

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:54.283
Hey. No, I... I don't think he can see me.

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:17.041
Oh, let's wiggle, Jason.

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:21.126
I call this the algebra. Woo!

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.680
How do you even do that?

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.568
You should keep that.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:34.565
You've earned it.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.370
I'll come back for it.

01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:40.444
That was terrifying. See you, buddy.

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.096
Jeremy Franklin
told everyone at school.

01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:58.360
The blue was the best one.
That's who I wanna be.

01:51:58.440 --> 01:51:59.776
Hey, no,
I wanna be the blue one!

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.086
I wanna be blue one.

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:04.004
Hey, how about one of you guys
try to be the yellow one?

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.402
Oh, yeah, the yellow one!
Oh, he's so cool!

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.164
How do you know it's a he?

01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.330
Checkmate.

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.771
Billy! Jason Scott is here

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.161
and Kimberly Hart and Zack Taylor

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:48.089
and some girl named Didi.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:50.561
Mom, it's Trini! I'm coming! I'm coming!

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.209
<i>This ranger team
did what my team could not.</i>

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:01.967
<i>You will humbly walk amongst your peers,</i>

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.407
<i>but heroes you all will be.</i>

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:07.211
- Attention! Attention in detention.
<i>- Each of your names</i>

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.727
<i>will be etched alongside
the great ranger teams before you.</i>

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:17.006
<i>I will always owe a debt
of gratitude to you all.</i>

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:33.524
<i>Oh, we have
a new detention student.</i>

01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:35.602
"Tommy Oliver."

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:38.087
Tommy Oliver?

01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:41.885
Tommy Oliver!

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.130
Tommy Oliver?

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.685
Tommy Oliver!

01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:52.607
Cranston.

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:53.816
That might have been my fault.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.560
That might have been my fault,
I'm so sorry.
