WEBVTT

00:15.708 --> 00:17.000
[opening title music]

00:30.333 --> 00:31.583
[bats screeching]

00:32.583 --> 00:35.000
[Jubilee] The limestone
is easily dissolved by water

00:35.000 --> 00:37.833
containing small amounts
of carbonic acid,

00:37.833 --> 00:39.625
creating caverns which form--

00:39.625 --> 00:42.166
Incrementally over
millions of years!

00:43.583 --> 00:46.083
Yeah. Right again, Spenser.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.125
Did you know
that Carlsbad Caverns

00:48.125 --> 00:50.125
is as big as
14 football fields?

00:50.125 --> 00:51.333
Er, no.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.958
I'm going to be a geologist.

00:52.958 --> 00:55.416
That's because you like playing
in the dirt.

00:55.416 --> 00:57.125
-Do not!
-Do too!

00:57.125 --> 00:58.625
Hey, time out!

00:58.625 --> 01:00.083
These caves go under all

01:00.083 --> 01:01.500
of Professor Xavier's school,

01:01.500 --> 01:04.583
so we've got a lot of exploring
to do.

01:08.625 --> 01:11.458
What kind of school
does Professor Xavier run?

01:11.458 --> 01:13.875
Well, it's kind of
experimental.

01:13.875 --> 01:16.333
I bet you get to do
some really rad things!

01:17.125 --> 01:18.458
Some of us do.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.000
[aircraft starting]

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
[Jubilee] Why do I
have to do it?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.333
[Xavier] Jubilee,
surely you've learned by now

01:25.333 --> 01:27.333
that there is no more
important work

01:27.333 --> 01:29.125
than teaching the young.

01:29.125 --> 01:30.708
Then let one of them do it!

01:30.708 --> 01:33.500
But, petite,
I'm not as patient as you,

01:33.500 --> 01:35.166
or as wise.

01:35.166 --> 01:37.708
You know how I go to pieces
around kids.

01:37.708 --> 01:41.208
These students were promised
this field trip months ago.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.208
If the President hadn't called,

01:43.208 --> 01:44.708
you know I would have
happily taken them.

01:44.708 --> 01:47.291
Yeah, how hard could it be?

01:47.291 --> 01:48.583
[Jubilee]
That's not the point!

01:48.583 --> 01:51.000
[blasting off]

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
You all get to talk
to the President

01:53.000 --> 01:54.750
while I get to babysit!

01:57.291 --> 01:59.458
-[thwack]
-[thud]

01:59.458 --> 02:02.625
[Cynthia] Miss Lee? Miss Lee?

02:02.625 --> 02:04.416
[Jubilee sighs]

02:04.416 --> 02:07.625
Sorry, I guess
I kind of drifted off.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.125
Let's go this way.

02:09.125 --> 02:11.708
I bet there are even more
rocks to see.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.291
[Spenser] Wow!
Look at the cool stalactites!

02:18.291 --> 02:19.875
[rumbling]

02:19.875 --> 02:22.000
[crumbling]

02:22.000 --> 02:23.875
Everybody,
get against the wall.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.291
Will it hurt us?

02:26.291 --> 02:28.708
No, it won't last long.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.250
This is awesome!

02:34.458 --> 02:36.375
-Everyone okay?
-Yeah.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.875
-[Jacky] I want to go home.
-I'm okay.

02:37.875 --> 02:38.958
Wow!

02:40.708 --> 02:42.708
It came from behind us.

02:42.708 --> 02:44.875
Stay here, I'll be right back.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.125
[Jubilee] Uh-oh.

02:57.208 --> 02:58.958
-[Beeping]
-Wow!

02:58.958 --> 03:02.208
Is that a Sat-Com 2000
Digital Beeper?

03:02.208 --> 03:03.875
Yeah, I'm telling my friends

03:03.875 --> 03:05.375
where to find us
when we're done.

03:05.375 --> 03:07.250
Can it get through
all these rocks?

03:07.250 --> 03:09.208
Sure, no problem.

03:09.208 --> 03:12.208
Miss Lee, is it dangerous
down here?

03:12.208 --> 03:13.333
Heck, no!

03:13.333 --> 03:14.375
These caves have been here

03:14.375 --> 03:15.625
a zillion years.

03:16.708 --> 03:18.750
Hey, I've got an idea.
Forget the rocks.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.750
Everybody gather around.

03:20.750 --> 03:24.333
Until my friends show up,
I'm going to tell you a story.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.333
A scary one? With lots
of fighting and monsters?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.625
[both] Bad guys
getting stomped!

03:30.625 --> 03:32.583
Is it about
a handsome prince--

03:32.583 --> 03:34.708
And true love?

03:34.708 --> 03:37.083
[both] Love? Yuck!

03:37.083 --> 03:40.583
It's about all that
and a whole lot more.

03:40.583 --> 03:44.416
[Jubilee] A long time ago
there was a happy kingdom

03:44.416 --> 03:46.458
ruled by a handsome prince

03:46.458 --> 03:49.958
and his true love,
the fair Princess Jean.

03:49.958 --> 03:51.875
The greatest treasure
in the land

03:51.875 --> 03:54.458
was a shard
of the MacTaggert Crystal,

03:54.458 --> 03:58.500
a source of great power
divided in half
by the ancients.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.875
But that power
had attracted great evil.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.458
The sorcerer
Magnus the Malevolent,

04:04.458 --> 04:07.416
master of metal, attacked.

04:07.416 --> 04:10.166
Now Magnus could pursue
his evil dream

04:10.166 --> 04:12.875
of acquiring the other half
of the crystal,

04:12.875 --> 04:14.583
and with that power,

04:14.583 --> 04:17.833
conquer all kingdoms
everywhere.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.125
Halt! By order
of Magnus the Magnificent.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.583
Sorry, but this thief,
he no follow orders,

04:31.583 --> 04:33.166
he just run.

04:33.166 --> 04:34.583
[zapping]

04:34.583 --> 04:36.125
Get him,

04:36.125 --> 04:39.083
or Magnus will use us
for pots and pans!

04:44.125 --> 04:46.000
Hide me, mes amis.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
If the Clankers get me,
the rebellion is doomed.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.416
It will be a nightmare
if you don't help me!

04:52.416 --> 04:54.208
Under the hay!

04:55.583 --> 04:56.625
[zapping]

04:56.625 --> 04:59.125
Halt! By order of Magnus!

04:59.125 --> 05:00.333
Now what do we do?

05:00.333 --> 05:01.708
We fight!

05:04.875 --> 05:05.875
[zapping]

05:08.416 --> 05:09.416
[grunts]

05:09.416 --> 05:10.750
[thuds]

05:10.750 --> 05:11.750
[clanks]

05:14.166 --> 05:15.416
Let me go!

05:18.333 --> 05:19.333
[grunting]

05:24.000 --> 05:25.375
-[screams]
-[thuds]

05:27.750 --> 05:29.250
By aiding this traitor,

05:29.250 --> 05:30.583
you have declared yourselves

05:30.583 --> 05:32.125
the enemies of Magnus.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.708
Destroy them.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.958
Can no one help us?

05:35.958 --> 05:36.958
Listen!

05:38.583 --> 05:40.166
Can it be?

05:40.166 --> 05:41.708
It must be her!

05:41.708 --> 05:43.875
She does not exist.

05:43.875 --> 05:47.125
She is a fable you peasants
tell to give yourselves hope.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.291
If she does not exist,
mon capitaine,

05:50.125 --> 05:52.375
why are you so nervous?

05:52.375 --> 05:54.083
I fear nothing.

05:54.083 --> 05:57.833
Smash the peasants!
It is the command of Magnus.

06:00.416 --> 06:03.291
That's all the commanding
Magnus gets to do today.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.750
It is her!

06:05.750 --> 06:07.750
She is real!

06:07.750 --> 06:11.000
The one they call Jubilee!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.500
Destroy her!

06:12.500 --> 06:13.625
[zapping]

06:14.166 --> 06:15.458
[gasps]

06:15.458 --> 06:17.625
How come you get to be
the hero?

06:17.625 --> 06:18.833
Because it's my story.

06:18.833 --> 06:20.125
But that's cheating.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.833
[rocks crumbling]

06:23.458 --> 06:25.000
don't like that noise!

06:25.000 --> 06:26.500
It's okay.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.500
Caves always do
stuff like this.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.166
Hey! You guys want to hear

06:30.166 --> 06:32.458
what happens
with the metal warriors?

06:32.458 --> 06:35.250
-Yeah!
-Finish the story!

06:35.250 --> 06:37.000
What happened
with the metallics?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.125
[All] Yeah, what's next?

06:39.125 --> 06:41.125
[Metallic Captain]
Beware of her thunderbolt!

06:43.583 --> 06:44.958
[zapping]

06:47.625 --> 06:48.708
[smash]

06:50.083 --> 06:52.458
Help me! Please!

06:52.458 --> 06:54.125
Get her, you fool!

06:54.125 --> 06:56.583
We are still three to her one.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.375
Three, huh?

06:59.375 --> 07:00.875
The problem with you clankers

07:00.875 --> 07:03.000
is that Magnus
never taught you to count.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.083
[boom]

07:06.125 --> 07:08.000
Looks more like two to me!

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
[zaps]

07:17.458 --> 07:18.500
[clunks]

07:20.125 --> 07:22.833
Look like it just you
and Jubilee, eh?

07:22.833 --> 07:25.000
How you like them odds?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
[clunking]

07:27.958 --> 07:30.375
Going somewhere, Tin Man?

07:31.375 --> 07:32.416
[roars]

07:36.375 --> 07:37.708
[thuds]

07:37.708 --> 07:39.625
What manner of creature
is this?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.208
What's it to you,
you ungrateful--

07:42.208 --> 07:44.458
Hey, cool it!

07:44.458 --> 07:46.333
This is Logan,
my right-hand troll.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.000
He may look disgusting,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.416
but his heart is
brave and true.

07:50.416 --> 07:51.958
[growls]

07:51.958 --> 07:54.833
We thought we were doomed.

07:54.833 --> 07:57.583
Getting out of tight places
is what I do.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.458
The question is why,
my scruffy friend,

08:00.458 --> 08:02.583
were they so interested in you?

08:02.583 --> 08:06.250
Have you never heard
of the MacTaggert Crystal?

08:06.250 --> 08:08.333
Of course! Do you have it?

08:08.333 --> 08:09.500
Could you show it to me?

08:09.500 --> 08:12.083
Ah, fair warrior,

08:12.083 --> 08:14.875
I could show you
so many things--

08:14.875 --> 08:16.333
Watch it, bub.

08:16.333 --> 08:18.833
Just answer the question.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.166
Mon ami!We are friends, no?

08:22.250 --> 08:24.625
Come, I take you both
to the crystal.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.291
[Thief] Magnus,
he study for years

08:28.291 --> 08:30.291
to find the other half
of the crystal.

08:30.291 --> 08:33.583
When he find it,
he hire me to steal it.

08:33.583 --> 08:35.708
And you did, didn't you?

08:35.708 --> 08:39.875
I am the best of thieves,
and this was a challenge, no?

08:39.875 --> 08:43.458
Let me guess.
You decided to keep it?

08:43.458 --> 08:46.708
I may be thief,
but I'm not stupid.

08:46.708 --> 08:49.208
If Magnus get both halves
of the crystal,

08:49.208 --> 08:50.708
he'd be unstoppable!

08:50.708 --> 08:52.500
I give him a fake!

08:52.500 --> 08:54.958
And Magnus got wise,

08:54.958 --> 08:58.291
so your challenge now
is staying alive.

08:58.291 --> 09:02.416
[Logan] So, where did you hide
the little sparkler?

09:02.416 --> 09:05.958
[Thief] There,
in the Cavern of the Lost!

09:06.958 --> 09:10.833
I hid my half of the crystal
in the safest place there is.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.625
Beyond these doors

09:12.625 --> 09:14.125
is the secret stronghold

09:14.125 --> 09:15.958
of the Guild of Thieves.

09:15.958 --> 09:17.583
Most who find this place

09:17.583 --> 09:19.875
don't live long
trying to get in,

09:19.875 --> 09:21.583
but I know its secrets.

09:21.583 --> 09:22.583
[rumbling]

09:25.833 --> 09:27.708
[jingling]

09:43.416 --> 09:44.458
[lava bubbling]

09:51.208 --> 09:53.875
Could I change my look
in this place!

09:53.875 --> 09:55.708
[sighs] Get a grip, Jubilee.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.000
You're here for a reason.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.166
Maybe it not so good

09:59.166 --> 10:00.375
for a thief to say this,

10:00.375 --> 10:02.458
but I'm happy to get rid of it.

10:02.458 --> 10:06.083
Then you'll thank me
for taking the crystal

10:06.083 --> 10:09.000
and your worthless lives!

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
[echoing]

10:11.000 --> 10:13.833
[Marie] Why'd you stop?
This is so cool!

10:13.833 --> 10:16.583
You guys sit tight.
I want to check something.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.166
No way the bad guys
are going to stop her!

10:29.208 --> 10:30.458
[rumbling]

10:30.458 --> 10:31.583
[gasps]

10:31.583 --> 10:33.416
This could be a problem.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.583
I've got to get us
away from here.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.625
[Sam and Casey]
Is everything okay?

10:38.625 --> 10:41.708
Sure. I just think we ought
to see more of the cave.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, why do we have to move?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.458
What's wrong?

10:47.458 --> 10:48.875
Nothing.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.583
This tunnel
kind of goes uphill.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.875
It will make it easier
for my friends to find us.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.833
Can we hear
the rest of the story?

10:54.833 --> 10:55.833
Sure.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.375
[bursts open]

11:05.458 --> 11:07.208
Keep moving, guys.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.000
Miss Lee, the cave stops!

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Oh, I know. This chamber's
kind of my favorite.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.583
Hang loose for a sec.

11:16.708 --> 11:20.000
Man! I just can't
catch a break today.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.416
[water rushing in]

11:26.958 --> 11:29.000
Please let that hold
for a little while.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.125
[Casey] What happened
in the cave?

11:33.125 --> 11:34.291
In the cave?

11:34.291 --> 11:36.583
In the story, Miss Lee!

11:36.583 --> 11:38.333
Oh, yeah, the story.

11:38.333 --> 11:41.000
Well, things looked
pretty bad.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.708
[Jubilee] We... I mean,
the mighty warrior Jubilee

11:43.708 --> 11:46.250
and her followers were
outnumbered.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.500
And then...

11:47.500 --> 11:50.166
What do we do now, boss lady?

11:50.166 --> 11:52.250
Don't be afraid, Logan.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.875
Getting out of tight spots
is what I do.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.583
Not this time!

11:56.583 --> 11:58.458
Surrender the crystal,

11:58.458 --> 12:03.000
and I promise
your destruction
will be painless.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.083
Not so fast, fur ball!

12:05.083 --> 12:07.208
You want it,
you've got to get it.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.250
[laughing]

12:09.250 --> 12:11.250
[shouting]

12:11.250 --> 12:13.458
Is that all you've got?

12:13.458 --> 12:15.500
[thud]

12:15.500 --> 12:17.333
[high-pitched voice]
Did I upset
the little kitty cat?

12:17.333 --> 12:18.750
[grunting]

12:18.750 --> 12:21.583
You're just not very good
at this, are you?

12:21.583 --> 12:23.416
I'll rip you apart!

12:23.416 --> 12:24.875
I'm waiting.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.000
[shouting]

12:27.208 --> 12:28.875
-[roaring]
-[thuds]

12:29.708 --> 12:30.833
[thwacking]

12:32.583 --> 12:33.708
[grunting]

12:34.958 --> 12:37.125
[growling]

12:38.458 --> 12:41.083
-[thuds]
-Looks pretty ended to me.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.750
You are correct!

12:42.750 --> 12:45.750
Surrender or be destroyed.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.875
Destroyed, destroyed,
destroyed!

12:48.875 --> 12:50.875
Is that all you guys
ever think about?

12:56.250 --> 12:58.625
[Logan] Well, what do we do
with the Sabretooth?

12:58.625 --> 13:01.083
We'll come back for him,
someday.

13:02.875 --> 13:06.166
We've got the trinket,
but what do we do with it?

13:06.166 --> 13:07.958
I guess you've got a point
there.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.416
It's Xavier, the all knowing.

13:15.416 --> 13:18.333
[Logan] They say
he's the one wizard

13:18.333 --> 13:21.291
that even Magnus
can't get his hands on.

13:21.291 --> 13:24.500
Jubilee, heed my words.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.208
You are the key
to the power of the crystal.

13:28.208 --> 13:32.583
Your own light of goodness
will activate the gem,

13:32.583 --> 13:37.250
but not until the two half
pieces are joined.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.208
Then, and then only

13:39.208 --> 13:44.208
will you have the secret
of destroying Magnus!

13:44.208 --> 13:45.583
[Xavier echoing]

13:45.583 --> 13:47.458
Oh, that's great.

13:47.458 --> 13:51.166
All we gotta to do to get
the other half of the crystal

13:51.166 --> 13:54.583
is waltz right
into Magnus' fortress.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.458
Not this troll!

13:56.458 --> 13:58.500
Logan, we have no choice.

13:58.500 --> 14:02.500
It's mortally dangerous,
but that's what we heroes do.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.750
Well, at least we'll have
the advantage of surprise.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.125
[rat squeaking]

14:09.458 --> 14:10.458
[zap]

14:11.000 --> 14:13.458
Surprise the Master?

14:13.458 --> 14:14.458
[chuckles]

14:14.458 --> 14:16.958
I think not, short stuff!

14:19.125 --> 14:20.291
[thunder rumbling]

14:28.250 --> 14:29.250
[zapping]

14:33.208 --> 14:34.958
This lead to the dungeons,

14:34.958 --> 14:37.583
near the great vault
where Magnus keep the crystal.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.833
The vault is over there.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.250
How come you know so much
about this?

14:48.250 --> 14:49.583
It is my job.

14:55.625 --> 14:58.416
So far, so good.
It's been easy.

14:58.416 --> 15:00.333
Yeah, too easy.

15:02.833 --> 15:04.333
Look! There it is!

15:12.083 --> 15:14.875
Okay, guys, it's showtime!

15:16.583 --> 15:17.833
[Metallic Captain] Halt!

15:21.583 --> 15:22.833
[Logan] We've been set up!

15:24.000 --> 15:26.166
-[zapped]
-Logan!

15:26.166 --> 15:29.291
[Magnus] You play a good game,
my little brigand,

15:29.291 --> 15:32.500
but the final hand
is always mine!

15:37.750 --> 15:38.750
[gasps]

15:39.833 --> 15:41.125
[grunting]

15:42.708 --> 15:44.708
See how they pulsate,

15:44.708 --> 15:47.583
even in the dim light
of my dungeon!

15:47.583 --> 15:50.333
Imagine the power
trapped within,

15:50.333 --> 15:54.625
waiting to be unlocked
from its centuries of slumber.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.958
And you, my dear, are the key.

16:03.958 --> 16:07.875
Restore the shard
and I may even let you survive.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.125
I expected as much,

16:11.125 --> 16:14.208
and it would do scant good
to threaten you.

16:14.208 --> 16:16.833
You would resist me
to your grave.

16:16.833 --> 16:20.500
However, to save your friend,

16:20.500 --> 16:24.416
-I wager you would do anything!
-Logan!

16:24.416 --> 16:27.750
Your light brightens my world,
mistress.

16:27.750 --> 16:31.625
Please, don't use it
to make an evil darkness!

16:31.625 --> 16:34.708
Nobly said.
Better decide quickly.

16:34.708 --> 16:36.875
Stop it! You win!

16:36.875 --> 16:38.708
You want power, Magnus?

16:38.708 --> 16:41.250
Okay, you're going to get it!

16:48.333 --> 16:51.458
[Magnus] You have all been
loyal, whatever you are.

16:55.375 --> 16:58.000
But your services
are no longer required.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.166
[explodes]

17:01.750 --> 17:03.125
Let him go! Now!

17:03.125 --> 17:05.583
Now why would I do that,

17:05.583 --> 17:08.708
you pathetic,
silly little girl?

17:08.708 --> 17:10.375
You always claim

17:10.375 --> 17:13.375
that getting out
of tight spots is what you do.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.291
So get out of this one!

17:15.291 --> 17:16.875
But you promised!

17:16.875 --> 17:19.708
I am beyond promises!

17:19.708 --> 17:22.125
I am power!

17:22.125 --> 17:24.083
Well, power this!

17:24.083 --> 17:27.708
All you are doing
is making me stronger!

17:28.416 --> 17:32.125
That's just what I had in mind,
oh, Master of Metal!

17:33.375 --> 17:34.625
[clanking]

17:36.625 --> 17:38.750
You tricked me!

17:39.708 --> 17:42.583
I cannot control my power!

17:45.750 --> 17:46.875
[explosion]

17:48.291 --> 17:50.000
[men coughing]

17:53.083 --> 17:55.166
Watch where you're aiming
those things.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.583
We picked up your signal
and got here

17:56.583 --> 17:57.875
as soon as we could.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.708
-Is everyone all right?
-Yeah.

17:59.708 --> 18:02.750
You guys have
a great sense of timing.

18:02.750 --> 18:06.000
Okay, gang,
last one out is a troll!

18:08.250 --> 18:09.875
Hi, kid. I'm...

18:09.875 --> 18:12.500
Logan!
Yeah, I know, the troll!

18:15.875 --> 18:17.875
Who wants more hot cocoa?

18:17.875 --> 18:19.458
It's odd, Professor,

18:19.458 --> 18:21.458
but I don't sense the fear
that I should

18:21.458 --> 18:24.333
from children who have been
through this kind of trauma.

18:26.875 --> 18:27.958
Time to go.

18:27.958 --> 18:28.958
You haven't told us

18:28.958 --> 18:30.708
what happened to Jubilee!

18:30.708 --> 18:32.166
Finish the story!

18:32.166 --> 18:33.458
[both] Please.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.208
Story?

18:35.208 --> 18:37.333
I just thought
we all needed something fun

18:37.333 --> 18:38.500
to think about down there.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.750
Well, with Magnus destroyed,

18:40.750 --> 18:44.000
the kingdom was restored
and everyone was pretty happy.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
[cheering and applauding]

18:47.208 --> 18:50.000
They love you
for the hero you are.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.291
[giggles]

18:52.083 --> 18:56.125
They shall love you even more
as a princess.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.583
Of course, you'll have to learn
how to dress, how to speak.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.083
How to deal with
matters of state--

19:01.083 --> 19:03.291
We'll get you
the very best tutors.

19:03.291 --> 19:04.875
You'll have to study
day and night,

19:04.875 --> 19:07.875
but never fear, you can do it!

19:18.333 --> 19:20.833
You're going to give
all this up?

19:20.833 --> 19:21.875
Sure!

19:24.583 --> 19:26.458
Maybe I'll be a princess later.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.000
But for now there's still
lots of adventures

19:29.000 --> 19:30.291
to have in this world.

19:33.583 --> 19:36.500
Can we come back and hear
another story
sometime, Miss Lee?

19:36.500 --> 19:37.583
Yeah!

19:37.583 --> 19:39.000
Can we?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.583
[both] Please?

19:40.583 --> 19:42.000
It's a promise!

19:46.125 --> 19:48.208
Jubilee,
did those children know

19:48.208 --> 19:50.125
how much danger they were in?

19:50.125 --> 19:51.458
What danger?

19:51.458 --> 19:53.458
We all knew
we were going to be saved

19:53.458 --> 19:54.958
saved by a one-eyed prince,

19:54.958 --> 19:56.333
a yellow troll

19:56.333 --> 19:59.208
and the fearless Jubilee.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.833
Got to go wash up!

20:02.166 --> 20:04.583
You know,
I think our young lady

20:04.583 --> 20:07.750
has always been ready
for all the "adventures
to have in this world."

20:08.416 --> 20:11.750
[Wolverine] Yeah,
but is the world ready for her?

20:14.208 --> 20:17.166
I know that voice!
Wait! Don't go in!

20:25.583 --> 20:27.291
-Mother?
-Mystique?

20:27.291 --> 20:28.500
Rogue!

20:29.750 --> 20:31.708
I don't know what tricks
you're playing, mama,

20:31.708 --> 20:33.375
but nobody's touching
Nightcrawler.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.250
What are you doing here?
You'll ruin everything!

20:35.250 --> 20:36.875
They just want your brother!

20:37.833 --> 20:39.000
[Both] Brother?
