Cassandra.

00:02.281 --> 00:03.346
What did you do to her?

00:03.348 --> 00:05.315
Saved her life. What did you do?

00:06.984 --> 00:08.885
You in there? Cassandra?

00:09.988 --> 00:11.721
<i>Party's over, everyone.</i>

00:12.490 --> 00:13.924
Here she comes!

00:15.527 --> 00:17.427
Congratulations, daddy.

00:17.429 --> 00:19.095

Do your zombie voodoo thing!</i>

00:19.598 --> 00:20.430
It's not working!

00:21.399 --> 00:23.767
Get away from my baby,
you damn dirty zombie!

00:23.769 --> 00:25.168
Go!

01:49.487 --> 01:50.654
Doc!

02:24.989 --> 02:27.324
Holy acid flashback, man.

02:41.039 --> 02:42.372
It's okay.

02:44.743 --> 02:46.076
Let me out!

Oh good, you see them too.

03:11.001 --> 03:11.868
Addy!

03:11.870 --> 03:12.902

This was so wrong.

04:18.369 --> 04:19.969
I'll take her now.

04:22.173 --> 04:24.140
Adorable, isn't she?

04:24.142 --> 04:26.142
Thought you didn't like babies.

04:26.144 --> 04:29.412
I never said that.
I said I didn't like <i> that</i> baby.

04:29.414 --> 04:32.415
But she's daddy's precious little angel,
aren't you?

04:36.654 --> 04:38.021
What?

04:38.355 --> 04:40.590
I can't believe people used to wear these.

04:40.592 --> 04:43.560
I mean they're cool and all.
But what's the point?

04:43.562 --> 04:44.494
Storage.

04:44.496 --> 04:45.528
Can you imagine

04:45.530 --> 04:47.630
sitting in a theater behind
someone wearing that?

04:47.632 --> 04:49.165
No wonder they shot Lincoln.

04:51.435 --> 04:52.502
What, too soon?

04:54.538 --> 04:56.439
How's little Lucy?

04:56.707 --> 04:58.842
Finished all her sugar water
like a good little girl.

04:58.844 --> 05:00.410
Didn't you, LuLu?

05:03.415 --> 05:04.814
That's my little stinker.

05:04.816 --> 05:06.149
Oh.

05:06.151 --> 05:08.218
Have you smelled yourself lately?

05:08.220 --> 05:09.486
Please.

05:09.488 --> 05:11.754
Come on. Get away from the big bad man.

05:11.756 --> 05:13.923
<i>Yeah, that's it. Come on.</i>

05:14.692 --> 05:16.259
Oh that's right.

05:17.761 --> 05:19.229
Okay, let's sit down.

05:22.099 --> 05:23.900
Oh, there you go.

05:27.404 --> 05:30.507
Hey. Is anybody else worried about the baby?

05:30.509 --> 05:32.675
I don't know whether to be
worried <i> for</i> that baby

05:32.677 --> 05:34.711
or afraid of that baby.

05:34.713 --> 05:36.179
You see the way she attracts Zs?

05:36.181 --> 05:37.347
That baby,

05:37.349 --> 05:40.517
and I use the word loosely,
is gonna get us all killed.

05:40.519 --> 05:42.151
Bro, she's a baby. Relax.

05:42.153 --> 05:44.687
Yeah. A baby sprung from Murphy's loins.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.456
She's not just a baby.

05:46.957 --> 05:48.358
She's something else.

05:48.559 --> 05:52.095
She could grow up to be the
savior of the human race

05:52.097 --> 05:53.563
or the queen of destruction.

05:53.565 --> 05:57.033
And we need to find out which
and do what we got to do.

06:12.283 --> 06:13.449
You know

06:13.451 --> 06:14.684
<i>Fatherhood</i>

06:15.953 --> 06:17.487
changes you.

06:18.422 --> 06:21.190
It makes you want to be a better man.

06:21.358 --> 06:22.292
Yes.

06:22.893 --> 06:24.861
Oh. Rub my feet, darlin'.

06:24.863 --> 06:27.096
These dogs are barking.

06:27.431 --> 06:29.799
Oh, oh.

07:17.815 --> 07:19.549
Caught some trout.

07:20.818 --> 07:23.119
Kid, you are a fishing guru.

07:23.888 --> 07:25.555
What's your secret?

07:25.557 --> 07:27.357
Be one with the fish.

07:28.293 --> 07:29.692
Far out.

07:30.294 --> 07:32.662
Atta boy

07:32.664 --> 07:34.530
Well I got some foil in here somewhere.

07:34.532 --> 07:36.466
We're gonna fry one of them bad boys up.

07:36.468 --> 07:37.934
All right.

07:44.308 --> 07:46.943
Hey

07:46.945 --> 07:48.845
We need to get a look at that baby.

07:48.847 --> 07:49.912
Yeah, well good luck.

07:49.914 --> 07:52.982
Super Dad over there won't
let anybody touch her.

07:53.851 --> 07:56.819
I'm guessing he's afraid
we're gonna leave her behind.

08:00.791 --> 08:03.459
Which isn't something that we're
actually considering doing,

08:03.461 --> 08:04.394
right?

08:07.197 --> 08:09.932
Something tells me she's
gonna outlive us all.

08:18.509 --> 08:20.109
Where's Vasquez?

08:21.345 --> 08:22.478
Disappeared again.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.715
I passed him in the woods.
Heading south toward town.

08:26.950 --> 08:29.585
Well I'm gonna find out where
he keeps disappearing to.

08:29.587 --> 08:32.922
And you two see if you can't
get that baby away from Murphy.

08:33.557 --> 08:35.058
Hey, Warren.

08:35.059 --> 08:35.792
Thanks.

08:35.794 --> 08:37.559
Save me some fish.

10:29.373 --> 10:32.508
Son of a bitch. Zeros.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.880
Hey, Murphy.

10:39.883 --> 10:40.650
Hey.

10:40.652 --> 10:41.951
How you doing?

10:42.319 --> 10:43.586
What do you want?

10:43.754 --> 10:44.854
I just thought I'd give you a break

10:44.856 --> 10:46.656
and hold little LuLu for a while.

10:46.658 --> 10:47.990
She's fine.

10:48.292 --> 10:49.225
We're fine.

10:49.227 --> 10:50.693
Yeah, sure.

10:51.195 --> 10:53.429
Hey, what is she chewing on?

10:53.730 --> 10:55.398
I dunno. Something she picked up.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.699
Is that a finger?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.201
Maybe.

11:00.537 --> 11:02.471
Come here.

11:05.310 --> 11:06.876
Great. You happy now?

11:08.112 --> 11:09.145
Shhh.

11:09.147 --> 11:10.713
Look, Murphy.
Nobody's saying you're a bad father.

11:10.715 --> 11:12.982
We just think it'd be
a good idea to you know

11:12.984 --> 11:14.817
give the baby a little checkup. That's all.

11:14.819 --> 11:16.152
There's nothing wrong with little LuLu.

11:16.154 --> 11:18.254
And since when are you a pediatrician, huh?

11:18.256 --> 11:20.423
Murphy, she's just had sugar water to eat.

11:20.425 --> 11:22.024
Let Doc have a quick look at her.

11:22.026 --> 11:23.259
She looks fine to me.

11:23.261 --> 11:24.627
Takes a village.

11:27.598 --> 11:30.099
I don't know what you up to.
But I don't like it.

11:33.670 --> 11:34.770
Stop following me.

11:35.038 --> 11:36.472
We're not following you.

11:36.907 --> 11:38.174
You're afraid of her.

11:38.475 --> 11:41.210
Or afraid of what she might become.
What <i> we</i> might become.

11:41.212 --> 11:43.546
Don't forget.
I've seen how you treat babies.

11:43.548 --> 11:45.748
And we've seen how you treat humans.

11:46.850 --> 11:48.751
I'm not gonna let you hurt her.

11:48.753 --> 11:49.352
Murphy.

11:50.421 --> 11:52.355
Baby and I are going for a walk.

11:52.357 --> 11:54.290
Make sure they stay here.

11:54.292 --> 11:55.458
Nobody leaves.

11:55.460 --> 11:56.659
Nobody leaves.

11:57.261 --> 11:58.761
Where do you think you're going?

11:58.763 --> 11:59.929
Someplace safe

11:59.931 --> 12:01.864
from people like you.

12:49.526 --> 12:51.928
It's okay. We don't need them.

12:52.229 --> 12:56.766
Daddy's got you,
and nothing and nobody's gonna hurt you.

13:06.377 --> 13:08.411
Get out of here, you zombie varmints.

13:14.218 --> 13:15.852
That was creepy.

13:16.220 --> 13:17.787
Even for the apocalypse.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.615
You're hit.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.452
I'm losing a lot of blood.

14:22.686 --> 14:23.719
You too.

14:24.888 --> 14:26.122
We got to get out of here.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.925
Yeah, but we got to do
something about this bleeding.

14:28.959 --> 14:30.960
But first, we got to get out of here.

14:30.994 --> 14:31.928
Okay.

14:32.463 --> 14:33.930
Enough is enough.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.371
Okay.

14:42.406 --> 14:44.574
Daddy really needs you to be quiet now.
Okay?

14:51.215 --> 14:51.914
There you go.

15:07.331 --> 15:08.498
Bad?

15:11.001 --> 15:11.834
You?

15:14.404 --> 15:16.472
Got to stitch these wounds
or we're gonna bleed out.

15:16.507 --> 15:18.474
We won't make it back to camp.

15:19.109 --> 15:20.343
The ER is this way.

15:21.345 --> 15:23.546
You think anything will be left?

15:23.580 --> 15:25.748
No, but it'd be better than out here.

15:25.782 --> 15:27.683
We can hide from your friends.

15:33.056 --> 15:36.959
I think we got to go after him.

15:36.994 --> 15:38.561
He shouldn't be out there alone.

15:38.595 --> 15:40.196
Especially not with the baby.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.498
What about little miss sunshine over there?

15:42.533 --> 15:44.433
He told her to stop us.

15:45.202 --> 15:47.336
She can't stop all of us at once.

15:50.507 --> 15:51.574
Well I dunno.

15:51.608 --> 15:53.409
I think we should wait
for Warren and Vasquez.

15:53.443 --> 15:54.343
They'll be here soon.

15:54.378 --> 15:56.112
Yeah, but we don't even know where they are.

15:56.146 --> 15:58.681
And what if something happens to the baby?

15:58.715 --> 16:00.216
Or Murphy?

16:00.717 --> 16:03.186
He didn't take any food for the baby.

16:03.220 --> 16:05.988
Why would he not take food for the baby?

16:06.023 --> 16:08.724
Oh. He wouldn't do that, would he?

16:09.726 --> 16:12.695
We don't know what he's capable of.

16:12.996 --> 16:14.797
He's more zombie than he is human.

16:15.465 --> 16:16.299
I know, sweetie.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.801
I miss mommy too. Sort of.

16:18.835 --> 16:20.870
But someday, when you're old enough,
like 50, I'll

16:20.904 --> 16:24.006
tell you the whole horrible tale
about how I met your mother.

16:24.041 --> 16:27.343
But right now,
I need you to shut your little baby face.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.744
Please? For daddy?

16:28.779 --> 16:30.279
Come on.

16:58.275 --> 17:00.643
No Zs around.

17:57.334 --> 17:58.467
Anything?

17:58.502 --> 18:01.037
I don't think they're following us.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.044
We're safe for now.

18:37.073 --> 18:37.706
I'm out.

18:37.740 --> 18:38.673
Me too.

18:38.775 --> 18:40.242
Down to my special.

18:42.245 --> 18:43.745
Now might be that special time.

19:24.887 --> 19:26.655
We need sutures,

19:27.223 --> 19:28.523
bandages,

19:29.325 --> 19:31.860
and antibacterial anything.

19:33.262 --> 19:34.496
Come on.

19:41.370 --> 19:43.038
Head to optometry.

19:47.176 --> 19:49.911
There's three of us and one of her.

19:49.946 --> 19:51.746
If she tries to stop us,

19:53.316 --> 19:55.750
we'll do what we have to do.

19:55.852 --> 19:57.018
What does that mean?

19:57.153 --> 19:59.921
She's not Cassandra. Not anymore.

19:59.956 --> 20:01.056
I don't know, man.

20:01.090 --> 20:02.591
She is getting weirder.

20:02.625 --> 20:03.992
And you've seen how strong she is.

20:04.026 --> 20:07.128
She would not hurt us. Not really.

20:07.296 --> 20:09.564
I wouldn't be so sure.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.233
We all run in different directions.

20:11.267 --> 20:12.701
She'll grab one of us,

20:12.735 --> 20:15.437
and the other two can go look for Murphy.

20:22.345 --> 20:24.079
All right. We're doing this.

20:24.113 --> 20:27.883
I hope she doesn't overreact
and do something crazy.

20:39.161 --> 20:40.161
Now.

21:08.591 --> 21:09.691
Cassandra!

21:09.725 --> 21:10.592
Stop!

21:11.260 --> 21:14.229
Stop it! Stop!

21:27.743 --> 21:28.910
Cassandra, stop it!

21:30.212 --> 21:32.380
What the hell are you doing?!

21:32.715 --> 21:34.349
Nobody leaves.

21:34.984 --> 21:37.586
I told you. It's not her.

21:37.787 --> 21:40.188
Of all the horrible things I have had to do

21:40.222 --> 21:41.423
in the apocalypse,

21:42.825 --> 21:44.459
this is probably the most horriblest.

23:22.895 --> 23:24.462
Found a suture kit.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.841
Any pain killers?

23:42.749 --> 23:44.749
Hold still. This might hurt.

23:46.252 --> 23:48.019
Actually it will hurt.

23:48.454 --> 23:50.021
How bad is it?

23:51.957 --> 23:53.858
Missed the artery.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.295
No passing out or dying on me.

23:57.297 --> 24:00.532
Remember somebody's got to sew me up.

24:03.402 --> 24:05.003
Hey, Warren!

24:05.471 --> 24:07.138
You with me?

24:13.913 --> 24:15.713
Just a few more.

24:20.786 --> 24:22.153
There.

24:39.639 --> 24:41.172
Hang it there, Warren.

24:41.174 --> 24:42.140
You're doing great.

24:43.609 --> 24:45.577
Being a real man about it.

24:47.513 --> 24:51.749
Women can take more pain than any man.
Scientific fact.

24:57.657 --> 24:59.290
Damn.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.560
Maybe you're right.

25:06.565 --> 25:11.836
Crazy

25:14.341 --> 25:15.807
That's it.

25:16.842 --> 25:18.576
Bleeding stopped.

25:20.846 --> 25:23.181
Better not leave a scar.

25:23.183 --> 25:26.951
Don't worry. It'll be a sexy scar.

25:30.990 --> 25:31.856
It'll do.

25:36.262 --> 25:37.662
How's the arm?

25:37.897 --> 25:39.764
Feeling's starting to come back.

25:39.766 --> 25:41.533
What are we doing about <i> it?</i>

25:43.869 --> 25:47.405
We can't just stay here.
Who knows what Murphy's up to.

25:48.407 --> 25:50.074
Could we try talking to her?

25:50.609 --> 25:53.011
I don't think she's in a talking mood.

25:53.013 --> 25:54.779
She'll talk to me.

26:03.756 --> 26:05.590
Get ready to run.

26:06.325 --> 26:07.792
What the hell is he doing?

26:07.794 --> 26:08.860
I don't know.

26:08.862 --> 26:10.728
But when somebody tells
me to get ready to run,

26:10.730 --> 26:12.196
I get ready to run.

26:26.645 --> 26:28.413
Cassandra.

26:29.615 --> 26:31.916
Cassandra, we need to talk.

26:34.820 --> 26:38.256
You really hurt Addy, Cassandra.

26:43.228 --> 26:45.196
Cassandra, listen.

26:46.899 --> 26:49.367
We need to look for Murphy.

26:50.369 --> 26:53.805
We want to help him,
but we need to find him first.

26:53.807 --> 26:55.540
Nobody leaves.

27:16.863 --> 27:18.496
That didn't sound good.

27:18.498 --> 27:20.565
Damn it. Come on. Come on.

27:24.103 --> 27:25.203
Cassandra.

27:36.782 --> 27:39.484
<i>You know to
leave the bullet, right?</i>

27:39.486 --> 27:43.354
No Hollywood shit trying to dig it out.

27:48.261 --> 27:50.194
Goddamn.

27:51.630 --> 27:53.665
What were you doing out there?

27:53.667 --> 27:55.500
Is this really the time for that?

27:55.502 --> 27:57.969
It'll distract you from the pain.

28:00.005 --> 28:02.040
You know what I was pre-Z?

28:02.042 --> 28:04.242
Does it matter?

28:04.543 --> 28:07.045
I was a DEA agent.

28:07.047 --> 28:09.981
I worked cross-border trafficking in Texas.

28:11.183 --> 28:12.350
I was good at it.

28:12.951 --> 28:15.353
Busted a lot of cartel members.

28:15.355 --> 28:17.355
Worst of the worst.

28:17.357 --> 28:19.257
Worked the US Mexican task force

28:19.259 --> 28:21.859
trying to dismantle the Zero Cartel.

28:23.195 --> 28:24.495
Go on.

28:25.397 --> 28:28.066
So the Zeros
did what they always do

28:28.068 --> 28:29.634
when someone gets in their way.

28:29.636 --> 28:31.069
Try to kill you?

28:31.071 --> 28:32.637
Tried to buy me.

28:32.639 --> 28:34.739
Said I'd still do my job,

28:34.741 --> 28:37.208
just busting their competition.

28:37.476 --> 28:40.178
And said I'd make millions on the side.

28:40.180 --> 28:42.013
So you said yes?

28:43.016 --> 28:45.483
No. I said no.

28:46.251 --> 28:48.619
So they made me a different offer.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.791
They kidnapped my wife.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.128
My baby girl.

28:57.629 --> 29:00.364
Offered to let me kill them quickly

29:02.301 --> 29:04.235
or they'd kill them slowly.

29:04.770 --> 29:06.337
Jesus.

29:07.906 --> 29:11.943
Then one of the Zero shot-callers showed up.

29:12.111 --> 29:16.814
He said he'd do me a favor,
but I'd owe him big time.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.652
I said anything.
Just help my wife and child.

29:22.621 --> 29:24.388
He said deal.

29:28.761 --> 29:32.296
Shot them right there in front of me.

29:36.235 --> 29:39.504
That way day one of the zombie apocalypse.

29:40.506 --> 29:44.475
My wife was the first
person I ever saw turn.

29:46.011 --> 29:48.713
So you're trying to find the
Zero that killed your family?

29:48.715 --> 29:51.916
Yeah, but I don't know what he looks like.

29:52.651 --> 29:54.418
He wore a hood.

29:54.586 --> 29:55.620
You know uh

29:55.622 --> 29:57.221
All I remember is he had a

29:57.223 --> 30:00.925
tattoo of a face on his shooting arm.

30:01.226 --> 30:04.395
So was he one of the ones we killed today?

30:06.765 --> 30:07.732
No.

30:12.305 --> 30:14.772
So how do you know he's even alive?

30:17.709 --> 30:20.178
Someone that evil?

30:21.647 --> 30:23.147
He's alive.

30:23.149 --> 30:25.149
Probably right.

30:26.251 --> 30:29.987
That's a effed-up horrible story.

30:29.989 --> 30:33.157
How do I know you're telling me the truth?

30:33.692 --> 30:35.293
Doesn't matter.

30:35.295 --> 30:36.594
Why not?

30:40.666 --> 30:43.601
I think you took too long sewing me up.

30:55.948 --> 30:58.749
Come on. Don't die on me.

31:14.166 --> 31:15.933
Go away, damnit!

31:18.271 --> 31:20.605
We can hide in here.

31:23.977 --> 31:25.676
Oh, excuse me. I'm

31:36.099 --> 31:37.665
Damn zombies.

31:37.667 --> 31:38.433
What?!

31:38.435 --> 31:40.835
I said damn zombies!

31:42.338 --> 31:43.805
Right!

31:46.308 --> 31:48.376
Shhh.

31:51.313 --> 31:53.915
I guess you and the baby better come inside.

31:53.917 --> 31:54.782
What?!

31:54.784 --> 31:55.450
I...

32:22.578 --> 32:25.780
It's okay, Ma.
He's got a little baby with him.

32:26.782 --> 32:28.283
Oh, a little one.

32:29.652 --> 32:32.687
She's afraid of strangers.

32:33.422 --> 32:36.758
I'm sure she's hungry.
We've got some rabbit's milk.

32:37.226 --> 32:39.360
Uh, that's very kind.

32:43.499 --> 32:45.333
What's wrong with you?

32:45.668 --> 32:48.269
Why are you so blue?

32:49.305 --> 32:51.039
Vitamin deficiency?

32:53.008 --> 32:55.910
We don't get many folks out here.

32:56.078 --> 32:57.278
What's your business?

32:57.280 --> 33:00.148
Could you point that some other way?

33:00.150 --> 33:01.149
Can.

33:01.951 --> 33:03.418
Won't.

33:04.486 --> 33:07.021
You were telling me your business.

33:08.290 --> 33:11.359
My daughter and I got
separated from our group.

33:11.361 --> 33:13.194
Don't you lie to me, mister.

33:13.196 --> 33:15.029
I will kill you right where you sit.

33:15.031 --> 33:17.498
Just like that last fellow.

33:20.703 --> 33:21.636
Thank you.

33:21.804 --> 33:23.237
Talk.

33:25.607 --> 33:29.243
We left a group of survivors
that we were traveling with.

33:29.245 --> 33:31.579
I think they wanted to take my girl.

33:32.147 --> 33:34.315
Her crying attracts zombies.

33:36.085 --> 33:38.753
Well now we're getting somewhere.

33:39.621 --> 33:40.888
Where you headed?

33:40.890 --> 33:42.457
I don't know.

33:42.459 --> 33:45.226
I just wanted to get her away from them.

33:45.228 --> 33:46.928
You don't mind me saying, mister,

33:46.930 --> 33:48.830
that's not much of a plan.

33:48.832 --> 33:51.399
You don't have no food, no water, nothing?

33:51.401 --> 33:52.734
No.

33:52.901 --> 33:54.268
Not really.

33:54.870 --> 33:58.339
I ought to shoot you for bad parenting.

34:02.277 --> 34:04.078
Listen. Ummm

34:04.713 --> 34:06.247
I have an idea.

34:08.817 --> 34:12.286
I can't take her back to the group.

34:12.288 --> 34:15.822
And I can't take her
with me where I'm going.

34:17.092 --> 34:18.893
You seem like good people.

34:19.261 --> 34:21.929
You got a nice safe setup here.

34:22.264 --> 34:23.898
It's a real home.

34:27.101 --> 34:29.137
Would you

34:31.672 --> 34:34.409
Would you take my daughter and raise her?

34:36.078 --> 34:37.612
Are you serious?

34:40.382 --> 34:43.217
I've never been more serious in my life.

34:46.621 --> 34:48.422
Oh, Pa. Could we?

34:48.690 --> 34:51.292
I know it's a burden, but

34:51.760 --> 34:53.728
here she is.

34:54.129 --> 34:57.231
A little angel, fallen into our lives.

35:21.990 --> 35:23.658
What's her name?

35:24.593 --> 35:26.094
It's Lucy.

35:27.563 --> 35:29.130
Lucy.

35:30.667 --> 35:31.432
It's okay.

35:31.434 --> 35:32.200
It's okay.

35:32.202 --> 35:33.901
What the hell is it? Is she bitten?

35:33.903 --> 35:37.872
I don't see anything.
But she's awful blue. And her eyes

35:37.874 --> 35:40.108
Okay, mister.
You are going to take your daughter

35:40.110 --> 35:42.110
and you're going to leave
before I spill blood, okay?

35:42.112 --> 35:42.977
Just let me explain.

35:42.979 --> 35:44.112
I said go!

35:44.114 --> 35:46.347
Okay. Okay, we're going.

35:47.683 --> 35:49.784
Shhh. Okay.

35:50.720 --> 35:51.719
Shhh.

35:58.994 --> 36:01.729
Can I ask one small favor?

36:03.599 --> 36:04.999
For Lucy?

36:47.543 --> 36:49.677
I hope you find your wife

36:49.679 --> 36:51.345
and your little girl.

36:52.014 --> 36:53.614
I give you mercy.

36:58.754 --> 37:00.421
Jesus, Warren.

37:00.656 --> 37:02.256
I thought you were dead.

37:03.458 --> 37:04.792
Guess not.

37:09.398 --> 37:11.399
Uh oh

37:11.401 --> 37:13.401
Well they've definitely been here all right.

37:13.403 --> 37:15.636
God

37:15.638 --> 37:16.971
Okay. All right.

37:18.507 --> 37:20.441
Well where did they go from here?

37:20.443 --> 37:23.311
It's hard to say. I wonder how 10K's doing.

37:23.313 --> 37:25.880
He's all right.
She wouldn't really hurt him.

38:06.856 --> 38:08.155
<i>♪</i> Stop it!

38:10.393 --> 38:11.692
<i>♪</i> Stop it!

39:57.865 --> 40:00.366
<i>Well we didn't find Murphy.</i>

40:00.401 --> 40:02.502
<i>But we found these two.</i>

40:02.536 --> 40:08.107
And not a minute too soon.
We didn't have much fight left.

40:08.943 --> 40:10.376
What's that?

40:11.011 --> 40:12.478
Cassandra.

40:14.949 --> 40:16.583
Oh my God.

40:16.617 --> 40:17.917
What happened?

40:18.252 --> 40:20.687
I did what I had to do.

40:22.289 --> 40:23.623
You mercied her?

40:23.657 --> 40:25.892
She gave me no choice.

40:25.926 --> 40:27.360
Saw that one coming.

40:27.962 --> 40:30.063
She was our friend.

40:30.164 --> 40:31.097
No.

40:31.432 --> 40:33.066
No, she wasn't.

40:33.701 --> 40:36.035
Cassandra was our friend.
That wasn't Cassandra.

40:36.337 --> 40:39.439
It's okay, kid. We understand.

40:39.773 --> 40:42.175
Don't try to make me feel better about it.

40:42.209 --> 40:43.910
I don't want to feel better about it.

40:43.944 --> 40:46.279
There's nothing to feel better about.
Nothing.

40:46.313 --> 40:48.214
That's what I want to feel.

40:48.249 --> 40:50.416
What's going on here?

40:53.254 --> 40:55.088
Where's Cassandra?

40:57.424 --> 40:58.925
She's dead.

40:59.927 --> 41:01.728
I'm sorry.

41:03.564 --> 41:04.797
Dead?

41:05.966 --> 41:07.400
How?

41:07.434 --> 41:08.601
What happened?

41:09.069 --> 41:10.770
I mercied her.

41:11.538 --> 41:13.172
You.

41:14.174 --> 41:15.441
I gave her life.

41:15.476 --> 41:17.977
And you had no right to take that away.

41:18.012 --> 41:19.979
She wasn't human.

41:20.347 --> 41:22.348
<i>That</i> wasn't human.

41:22.783 --> 41:24.918
Not since you bit her.

41:27.154 --> 41:28.187
Three thousand

41:28.222 --> 41:29.923
two hundred

41:29.957 --> 41:31.658
fifty five.

41:35.562 --> 41:37.397
Not right now.

41:39.433 --> 41:41.067
Not now.

41:45.739 --> 41:47.607
Where's the baby?

41:48.575 --> 41:50.243
Where's Lucy?

41:51.178 --> 41:54.614
You don't have to worry
about the baby anymore.

42:07.561 --> 42:10.129
<i>I think this is for the best, Pa.</i>

42:10.164 --> 42:13.099
<i>I agree, Ma.
It's the only decent thing to do.</i>

42:13.133 --> 42:16.469
That way that nice fellow
can get back to his friends

42:16.503 --> 42:19.205
while Lucy is safe here with us.

42:20.541 --> 42:22.675
Isn't she beautiful?

42:23.711 --> 42:27.680
We have to be the two luckiest
people in the whole apocalypse.

42:27.715 --> 42:29.482
Amen.
