[beeping]

01:04.147 --> 01:07.233
It appears that all of the planets
we've engaged have been pacified,

01:07.317 --> 01:09.027
if not totally liberated.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.573
-[blaring continues]
-Wait.

01:13.656 --> 01:16.868
There's another Galra battle cruiser
approaching Naxzela.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.710
Sector Zar Niomofor is clear.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.671
Let me see if I can get a line
on that battle cruiser.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.799
[powering down]

01:33.802 --> 01:36.930
Zaiforge cannon Senfama,
are you still operational?

01:38.014 --> 01:40.016
[powering down]

01:40.099 --> 01:41.267
[sighs]
Negative.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.062
[Coran] <span style="style.default_1">That incoming battle cruiser</span>
<span style="style.default_1">must have shut them down remotely.</span>

01:44.729 --> 01:45.772
Sorry, Shiro.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.775
That's it for artillery support.
What should we do about that cruiser?

01:56.032 --> 01:59.119
That cruiser's gonna be too late.
Naxzela's almost secure.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.746
We just need to take out
the last of the heavy artillery.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.082
On our left! Shield up!

02:08.836 --> 02:11.506
[all grunting]

02:41.411 --> 02:43.413
[male soldier] This is the most
devastating attack on the empire

02:43.496 --> 02:44.956
in 10,000 years.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.711
We left ourselves vulnerable.
Now, we face overwhelming resistance.

02:49.794 --> 02:53.339
Do we attack now, or should we wait
for orders from Emperor Zarkon?

02:53.423 --> 02:56.467
Lord Zarkon is busy
leading the hunt for Lotor.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.970
We can handle this on our own.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.472
Stay on course for Naxzela.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.148

03:27.790 --> 03:29.792
[female soldier]
Sire, one of our deep space beacons

03:29.876 --> 03:31.544
just registered some activity.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.797
It's not far from our position.
I could send a scout.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.261
It's Lotor.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.057
All fleets head for that beacon.

[grunting]

05:03.344 --> 05:06.681
He's headed for Nah-veer Five.
It's an unstable star.

05:07.265 --> 05:11.477
He thinks we'll be scared off
by a few solar flares. Stay on him.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.383
[female soldier]
The radiation is wreaking havoc

05:42.467 --> 05:44.010
on our navigation systems.

05:44.093 --> 05:47.513
We can navigate visually. Stay on him.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.686
[grunting]

05:58.191 --> 06:01.235
Cruiser six is down.
Squadron Erto is down.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.571
Sire, we're too close to the sun.

06:03.654 --> 06:06.115
This cruiser cannot handle
gravitation this strong.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.993
Pull back.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.882
[grunting, yelling]

06:31.641 --> 06:33.226

<span style="style.default_1">Our engines have overheated.</span>

<span style="style.default_1">We cannot pursue until they've stabilized.</span>

06:35.353 --> 06:37.230
It will be at least 12 doboshes.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.149
Track his trajectory.

06:45.279 --> 06:49.951
Stop the ship and hold this position.
We're close enough to Naxzela now.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.537
Close enough for what?
Voltron has captured the planet.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.580
There's no way for us
to attack from this distance.

06:55.164 --> 06:59.585
We need to gather every available ship
and get ready for the fight of our lives.

07:11.973 --> 07:16.144
Make sure no one disturbs my ritual
until Naxzela is destroyed.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.062
<span style="style.default_1">Vrepit sa.</span>

07:38.332 --> 07:39.834
Let us begin.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.520
Awake, Naxzela!

08:30.718 --> 08:33.554
[Lance]
<span style="style.default_1">Whoa! Did we cause that earthquake?</span>

08:33.638 --> 08:34.931
[Pidge]
<span style="style.default_1">I don't think so!</span>

08:45.107 --> 08:46.651
Guys, look over there!

09:08.589 --> 09:12.093
Uh... guys, what are those?

09:12.176 --> 09:14.887
We've never seen anything like this
from the Galra before.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.681
[Hunk]
<span style="style.default_1">Are they weapons?</span>

09:17.139 --> 09:19.642
[Pidge]
<span style="style.default_1">They look like some sort of generators.</span>

09:19.725 --> 09:22.228
-[Shiro] <span style="style.default_1">Stay alert.</span>
-[Lance] <span style="style.default_1">I say we get outta here.</span>

09:22.311 --> 09:24.105
<span style="style.default_1">Pidge, plot a course for our escape.</span>

09:24.188 --> 09:26.107
[Shiro] <span style="style.default_1">Hold on. We should find out</span>
<span style="style.default_1">what these things are.</span>

09:43.416 --> 09:44.750
[Hunk]
<span style="style.default_1">This can't be safe.</span>

09:54.552 --> 09:55.553
Do you feel that?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.638
That wave of darkness?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.141
[grunting]

10:03.269 --> 10:04.979
[Lance]
<span style="style.default_1">I can't move Red!</span>

10:05.062 --> 10:06.439
[Hunk]
<span style="style.default_1">Yellow won't budge, either.</span>

10:15.323 --> 10:19.160
This energy field is holding us down!
Gravity levels are spiking!

10:19.243 --> 10:21.871
[Shiro grunting]
<span style="style.default_1">We have to get outta here!</span>

10:22.580 --> 10:26.751
If we stay here, we'll be crushed.
Everyone, we have to focus.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.918
Give everything you've got,

10:28.002 --> 10:30.421
<span style="style.default_1">and maybe we can fight</span>
<span style="style.default_1">through this energy field.</span>

<span style="style.default_1">-Ready?</span>

10:59.325 --> 11:01.452
[Hunk]
<span style="style.default_1">Is... Is anyone else able to move around?</span>

11:01.535 --> 11:04.413
[Pidge] <span style="style.default_1">Barely, but the gravitational pull</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is worse on Voltron.</span>

11:04.497 --> 11:07.124
[grunting]

11:07.208 --> 11:08.918
Maybe if we go down to the surface,

11:09.001 --> 11:11.796
Hunk and I can figure out a way
to interrupt this energy field.

11:11.879 --> 11:12.880
That sounds good,

11:12.963 --> 11:15.716
except for the zillion robot dudes
still kickin' around down there.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.386
We're gonna have
to stay in tight formation.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.846
Watch each other's backs. Let's move!

11:22.139 --> 11:25.142

[all grunting]

11:46.122 --> 11:48.499
Pidge and Hunk,
do your thing and do it fast.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.547
This rod seems to go
all the way down into the planet's core.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.842
But I'm not detecting
any kind of energy source on the planet

11:57.925 --> 12:00.970
-that could be causing all of this.
-Then we'll need to follow it down

12:01.053 --> 12:02.930
-to the core.
-[door beeping, opening]

12:03.514 --> 12:04.890
It's open! Let's go!

12:18.362 --> 12:19.405
[Pidge]
Whoa.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.449
What is that?

12:22.533 --> 12:24.869
This is Zarkon's witch's doing.

12:24.952 --> 12:25.953
The energy I felt...

12:26.829 --> 12:28.664
This must be the source.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.875
[Shiro]
Allura, this facility...

12:31.667 --> 12:33.669
It looks... Altean.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.713
I'm afraid you're correct, Shiro.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.677
This is a decommissioned Altean
terraforming plant.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.514
Somehow, the witch has been able
to reactivate it remotely.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.183
Can you shut it down?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.351
I can try.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.151
[screaming]

12:57.234 --> 12:58.986

Allura!

[both groaning]

13:13.000 --> 13:14.293
Are you okay?

13:15.419 --> 13:16.504
It's too powerful.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.880
-[Hunk groaning]
-[both] Huh?

13:17.963 --> 13:19.048
[grunts]

13:20.007 --> 13:21.133
[moans]

13:22.968 --> 13:24.803
This soil is weird.

13:24.887 --> 13:29.058
It's so white and powdery,
like ground-up rocks or earth.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.644
-And heximite!
-[lasers firing]

13:38.359 --> 13:39.401
[Lance]
What's heximite?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.570
Some of us may have
slept through chemistry.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.989
The whole planet is a bomb,

13:44.073 --> 13:46.909
one that's big enough
to wipe out several solar systems.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.285
[Hunk]
It's under increasing pressure,

13:48.369 --> 13:51.914
and when the pressure reaches
a certain point, it's going to explode.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.792
-How long do we have?
-Maybe 20 minutes.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.045
We have to get off this planet
and warn everyone!

13:58.128 --> 14:00.047
[Hunk]
Anyone within ten solar systems of us

14:00.130 --> 14:02.424
 is going to get blown to pieces.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.678
They could take out Voltron, the rebels,
and the Blade of Marmora

14:05.761 --> 14:06.887
in one fell swoop.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.016
[all grunting]

14:11.100 --> 14:13.811
[grunting, panting]

14:16.063 --> 14:16.897
[Keith sighs]

14:16.981 --> 14:19.483
Coran, are there any targets
that need support?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.402
I haven't heard of anyone needing help.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.488
And that Galra fleet
heading towards Naxzela stopped.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.284
-Stopped?
<span style="style.default_1">-Yes. Quite a distance away, too.</span>

14:28.367 --> 14:31.453
[Kolivan] Perhaps the Galra decided
it's too well-fortified to attack.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.081
[Keith]
"Victory or death" is the Galra way.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.499
 They never stop attacking.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.377
Voltron.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.672
[Keith]
<span style="style.default_1">Shiro, can you hear me? Shiro!</span>

14:43.299 --> 14:44.717
<span style="style.default_1">Something's wrong.</span>

14:44.800 --> 14:48.053
Paladins? Allura? What's happened?

14:50.973 --> 14:53.392
It must be the magnetic distortion
from Naxzela.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.979
I'm gonna check it out. I need a ship.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.690
That'll work.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.160
Matt, something's wrong.
I can't reach Voltron.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.579
[Matt]
We can fly to Naxzela to check on 'em.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.372
[Keith]
<span style="style.default_1">No, I need your help.</span>

15:15.456 --> 15:18.083
<span style="style.default_1">I can't explain why, but I know</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we need to attack that fleet.</span>

15:18.542 --> 15:21.128
-I thought the fleet had stopped.
<span style="style.default_1">-It has...</span>

15:21.712 --> 15:23.797
<span style="style.default_1">but we're afraid</span>
<span style="style.default_1">it has something to do with Voltron.</span>

17:17.618 --> 17:21.540
Listen. We've come through a lot
as Voltron. We just have to think.

17:23.416 --> 17:24.417
<span style="style.default_1">Allura...</span>

17:25.294 --> 17:27.337
<span style="style.default_1">you felt the dark energy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when it first started.</span>

17:28.130 --> 17:31.633
<span style="style.default_1">You have a connection to this magic.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I know you can get us out of this somehow.</span>

17:31.717 --> 17:35.095
<span style="style.default_1">We all saw what you did on the Balmera</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and how you power the Castle.</span>

17:35.179 --> 17:38.932
I... I don't know. I haven't been trained.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.894
<span style="style.default_1">No one trained you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to save the Balmera, but you did that.</span>

17:42.394 --> 17:46.148
<span style="style.default_1">I know you can do it.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There's a reason the Blue Lion chose you.</span>

17:46.648 --> 17:49.735
<span style="style.default_1">You're the one who brought</span>
<span style="style.default_1">everyone together. You can do this.</span>

17:50.277 --> 17:53.614
<span style="style.default_1">Every moment we've had together,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">they've all led to this day.</span>

17:54.198 --> 17:57.534
<span style="style.default_1">This is your destiny.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You are the heart of Voltron.</span>

17:59.119 --> 18:01.038
Okay, I'll try.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.213
Help me, Father.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.890
-[all gasp]
-It's working!

18:48.544 --> 18:49.378
[roars]

18:55.759 --> 18:58.804
-Thank you, Lance.
-That was all you.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.391
[Hunk]
<span style="style.default_1">We still need to defuse that bomb!</span>

19:04.268 --> 19:05.644
<span style="style.default_1">Keith, can you hear me?</span>

19:05.727 --> 19:08.772
Shiro! Where are you? Is everything okay?

19:08.856 --> 19:11.316
<span style="style.default_1">Not for long</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if we don't stop Zarkon's witch.</span>

19:11.400 --> 19:13.861
<span style="style.default_1">She must be aboard that battle cruiser.</span>

19:13.944 --> 19:15.445
I'm way ahead of you.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.198
-And I brought some backup.
-[Olia] <span style="style.default_1">Rebel Squad is en route.</span>

19:18.907 --> 19:20.951
[Matt]
<span style="style.default_1">Good to have Voltron back in the fight.</span>

19:27.916 --> 19:30.252
What the ruggle is that?

19:31.378 --> 19:34.131
[Matt] It looks like some sort of weapon
attached to the cruiser.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.509
[Olia]
<span style="style.default_1">Evasive maneuvers!</span>

19:38.177 --> 19:41.805
<span style="style.default_1">Coran, you need to get as far away</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from Naxzela as you can immediately.</span>

19:41.889 --> 19:44.850
<span style="style.default_1">Pick up any members of the coalition</span>
<span style="style.default_1">who are nearby, but go.</span>

19:44.933 --> 19:46.518
Wh-What's happening?

19:46.602 --> 19:49.021
Naxzela is a bomb,
and it's about to go off.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.147
<span style="style.default_1">But what about you?</span>

19:50.230 --> 19:52.858
We'll stop it if we can,
but we need you to do this.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.444
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, Princess.</span>

19:56.862 --> 20:00.157
-[Lance] <span style="style.default_1">Thrusters are at max power!</span>
-[Hunk] <span style="style.default_1">I sure hope we make it in time.</span>

20:01.992 --> 20:02.993
[yelling]

20:05.579 --> 20:07.414
[continues yelling]

20:20.677 --> 20:23.055
Follow my lead!
We've got to break through that shield!

20:23.138 --> 20:23.972
[grunts]

20:26.642 --> 20:28.727
[groaning]

20:38.487 --> 20:39.947
We're not gonna make it!

20:40.948 --> 20:42.532
[rapid beeping]

20:43.116 --> 20:44.534
Please hurry, Princess.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.793
<span style="style.default_1">We'll never penetrate those shields!</span>

20:56.380 --> 20:57.965
Maybe not with our weapons.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.971
[Matt]
<span style="style.default_1">Wait! Keith, what are you doing?</span>

21:05.013 --> 21:06.056
Keith, no!

21:31.790 --> 21:33.542
[gasps, grunts]

21:47.889 --> 21:49.933
[screams, pants]

22:06.700 --> 22:09.953
Naxzela is returning to normal!
You did it!

22:10.037 --> 22:12.372
-Good work, Keith.
<span style="style.default_1">-It wasn't me.</span>

22:12.456 --> 22:13.457
[all]
Huh?

22:13.540 --> 22:14.708
It was Lotor.

22:14.791 --> 22:18.045
The cannon on his ship was the only thing
powerful enough to take down that shield.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.130
[electricity crackling]

22:20.213 --> 22:21.548
[rumbling]

22:21.631 --> 22:24.968
<span style="style.default_1">Commander Ladnok,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">take us out of here now.</span>

22:25.844 --> 22:26.845
<span style="style.default_1">Vrepit sa.</span>

22:37.397 --> 22:41.109
[Lotor] <span style="style.default_1">Attention,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Paladins of Voltron and rebel fighters.</span>

22:41.193 --> 22:44.446
<span style="style.default_1">I know we've had our differences</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in the past, but...</span>

22:46.490 --> 22:48.617
I think it is time we had a discussion.
