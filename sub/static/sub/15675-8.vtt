00:12.713 --> 00:13.247
Man:
Mr. MacMillan.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.286
Mr. MacMillan.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.456
We need to ask you
a few questions.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.261
( police radio chatter )

00:27.295 --> 00:30.464
Man #2:
...pack 'em up and label it.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.533
Do you have any
additional computers?

00:32.566 --> 00:35.303
You mean, do I own
another computer? No.

00:35.336 --> 00:38.706
Do I have access
to other computers?
Sure, so do you.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.741
You can go to your library,

00:40.774 --> 00:42.276
you can go to
your friend's house--

00:42.310 --> 00:43.577
Write down
all the locations

00:43.611 --> 00:45.313
of computers
you have access to.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.550
( radio chatter continues )

00:49.583 --> 00:51.552
Have at it.
There's nothing there.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.488
Yeah, that's what I said
when they came for me, too.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.235
What the hell is that?

01:07.268 --> 01:09.670
Oh, kid,
you've never seen
a packet sniffer?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.873
Meet your worst enemy.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.544
( beeping )

01:16.577 --> 01:18.412
( continues beeping )

01:29.790 --> 01:31.225
Sai:
Where you going?

01:31.259 --> 01:33.894
I'm just, um--

01:33.927 --> 01:35.463
I'm just gonna go
grab a bite to eat.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.464
They told you not to leave.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.831
What was that thing

01:37.865 --> 01:40.701
that they were shoving
into the phone jack?

01:40.734 --> 01:44.705
Sai:
You-- you didn't
do anything, right?

01:44.738 --> 01:46.907
Hey, what should I tell them
if they come back?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.709
Just don't say anything.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.316
( theme music playing )

02:25.846 --> 02:27.815
Joe:
Have a good morning.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.584
( whistling )

02:33.354 --> 02:34.888
( stops whistling )

02:37.358 --> 02:41.629
Hey, what the hell
was that?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.597
The FBI.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.299
God damn it, Joe.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.667
They're looking for Ryan.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.870
He, uh--
he did a stupid thing.

02:49.903 --> 02:53.507
He-- he released
the source code

02:53.541 --> 02:56.477
for MacMillan Utility's
anti-virus software online.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.679
- You've got to be kidding.
- All of it.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.614
It's a violation
of the CFAA--

03:00.648 --> 03:02.350
They think you did it.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.684
I know what
you're gonna say.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.852
It's what everyone's
gonna say, Joe.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.620
- Please, listen.
- Stop, stop!

03:06.654 --> 03:07.555
Stop.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.625
Look me in the eye

03:11.659 --> 03:13.761
and tell me you had nothing
to do with the leak.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.800
I had nothing
to do with it.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.576
All right.
Then I'm all in.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.945
All right?
We'll figure
this out together.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.318
While it's true
that the pace

03:37.351 --> 03:39.653
of Mutiny's growth
has slowed somewhat,

03:39.687 --> 03:42.323
multi-platform expansion
is not the only solution.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.559
Rather,
Mutiny is employing
a number of strategies

03:45.593 --> 03:48.729
which, taken together,
promise a second quarter
earnings uptick--

03:48.762 --> 03:50.731
Stop. You can't say that.

03:50.764 --> 03:51.932
It's not
in the prospectus.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.567
Well, I have
to say something.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.803
They can see
that that user numbers
are plateauing.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.305
The company's laudable
record of growth

03:57.338 --> 03:58.539
is fully documented
in the prospectus.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.007
That sounds like
I'm hiding something.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.609
You can't hype the stock.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.377
Well, what's the point
of doing this road show

04:03.411 --> 04:05.045
if all I can say
is read the prospectus?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.714
So, they read
the prospectus.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.749
Well, there are things
that I want to clarify.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.352
The prospectus should be
a living document.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.687
- Bosworth: Well, it's not.
- Diana: Sorry, SEC rules.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.389
Look,
you're doing great.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.425
The whole point
of coming to these
smaller firms first

04:17.458 --> 04:18.992
is so that you can
work out the kinks

04:19.026 --> 04:20.828
before we take it
to the big guns in
Boston and New York.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.030
I thought it went
pretty well last night,
don't you think?

04:23.063 --> 04:25.533
No, I think they were
all underwhelmed.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.968
Hey, I read the room
as I see it.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.603
You did fine.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.938
Fortunately,
there isn't much

04:30.971 --> 04:33.073
investment capital
for tech in Denver.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.942
Look, everybody
hates this process,

04:34.975 --> 04:36.377
and everybody
gets through it.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.012
So, come on,
tell me about

04:39.046 --> 04:40.848
Mutiny's founder
Cameron Howe.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.783
I understand
she's no longer
with the company.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.456
Cameron is one
of the most talented coders
in Silicon Valley.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.791
She gave her heart
and soul to Mutiny,

04:50.824 --> 04:53.060
- and her spirit
is still very much--
- Bosworth: Oh, please!

04:53.093 --> 04:55.028
It sounds like
you're eulogizing
the family dog.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.364
That's what we agreed
I'd say.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.865
It doesn't pass
the smell test.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.767
Donna:
Do you have
a better suggestion?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.602
Something with a faint hint
of truth to it, maybe?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.538
Oh, so I should say
that she's a temperamental
narcissist

05:04.572 --> 05:07.007
with self-destructive
tendencies who doesn't
work with others?

05:07.040 --> 05:09.042
Well, at least
it sounds like you mean it
when you say that.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.712
I'm sorry that
there's no pretty way
to talk about this.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.547
But just a reminder,
you voted for it, too.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.617
Yes, I did, under duress,
as I recall.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.386
Nobody wanted it.
It's just what happened.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.653
And yet, here we are.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.656
Look, I'm just trying
to help out here.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.825
Unless you just want me
to go get the coffee?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.663
( door opens, closes )

05:29.697 --> 05:30.631
( sighs )

05:35.536 --> 05:37.070
Hey.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.542
Are you leaving already?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.511
Tom:
Yeah, I figured I'd wait
till my second week

05:43.544 --> 05:44.845
till I start
showing up late.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.648
- Oh.
- Yeah.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.584
Hey, can you,
uh, run to the store,

05:50.618 --> 05:53.587
get some candy for
the trick or treaters?

05:53.621 --> 05:57.991
- Mmm.
- Cam, they're kids,
they want candy,

05:58.025 --> 06:01.094
and you should try
to get out a little bit.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.867
- Can you do it?
- Mmm, no.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.537
Oh.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.472
- I love you.
- Love you.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.643
Mmm.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.649
( door opens, closes )

06:37.097 --> 06:38.799
( sighs )

06:51.078 --> 06:52.746
...Winner's Circle
over here.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.482
That's where you go
to win most of the money,

06:54.515 --> 06:55.683
though you can win
some bonus money

06:55.716 --> 06:56.984
at your chairs over there--

06:57.017 --> 06:59.186
10 and $25,000
to crack over there.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.455
- ( buzzing )
- These are the subjects
in the first game today.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.756
We've got "Water,
Water Everywhere";

07:02.790 --> 07:04.925
"Round And Round";
"Remember When";

07:04.958 --> 07:07.495
"Keep Them Sealed";
"We'll Be Right Back"--

07:07.528 --> 07:08.762
sounds like
commercial messages.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.097
I don't know what that is,

07:10.130 --> 07:11.599
but that sure sounds like
what it is.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.100
"King Kong's Kid";
and we have...

07:13.133 --> 07:16.036
( buzzing )

07:19.640 --> 07:22.710
( buzzing intensifies )

07:37.825 --> 07:39.259
( over phone )
It's Ryan Ray.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.862
This deal
between Joe and Gordon,

07:41.895 --> 07:43.797
it's bullshit.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.933
I was there
from the beginning.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.068
The network wouldn't
exist without me.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.805
And I'm better
than Gordon Clark
by a magnitude of 20.

07:51.839 --> 07:55.275
Gordon wants to roll over
for Cisco on TCP/IP upgrades.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.778
It's so short-sighted,
he's a joke!

07:57.811 --> 08:00.981
- That's who you're
in business with.
- ( button clicks )

08:01.014 --> 08:04.918
I don't know
what to say, Mitch.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.154
I'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.658
I was too invested
in this project to
just walk away.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.727
Listen, Joe, we like you.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.062
You believed
in the network.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.697
Hell, you walked away
from your own company

08:16.730 --> 08:18.265
when your board
voted against us.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.267
But Ryan--
let's face it,

08:20.300 --> 08:23.003
Ryan doesn't sound
like a guy who's gonna
keep his mouth shut.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.205
His next call
could be to my boss.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.907
Ryan would
never do that.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.776
Well, regardless,
we can't work with someone

08:28.809 --> 08:30.978
who's being investigated
for computer fraud,

08:31.011 --> 08:34.014
who blatantly violated
major legislation that
went into effect this year.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.749
Joe didn't do
anything wrong.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.250
Mitch:
I'm not saying he did.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.053
But until we find the person
who is responsible,

08:40.087 --> 08:42.956
you two need to stay away
from each other.

08:42.990 --> 08:46.259
And this network contract
is frozen.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.143
How did Ryan know
that we were working
together?

09:04.945 --> 09:08.315
Hmm? Down to the details
of my negotiations
with Cisco?

09:08.348 --> 09:11.284
He must be reading
our emails.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.921
He built the network.
He knows how to get inside
better than anyone.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.623
Well...

09:17.925 --> 09:19.226
we gotta turn him in.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.894
No, there must be
another way.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.763
What are you talking about?
Did you hear the tape?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.766
- The contract's frozen.
- I can't do that to him.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.267
Oh, Christ, Joe.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.338
He's my friend.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.309
I thought
I was your friend.

09:59.399 --> 09:59.700
( screams )

10:07.675 --> 10:09.342
( doorbell rings )

10:15.282 --> 10:18.051
( doorbell rings )

10:18.085 --> 10:20.153
All right.
Jesus, I'm coming.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.824
Kids:
Trick or treat!

10:23.857 --> 10:25.926
Ooh.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.028
You're the first non-princess
I've seen for hours.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.429
I hate princesses.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.964
Me, too.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.399
You only got one thing.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.669
Yeah.
Take it or leave it.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.742
Alf.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.110
Shoo.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.354
( knocking on door )

11:04.231 --> 11:05.799
Oh.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.035
( laughs )

11:08.068 --> 11:09.436
Well...

11:09.469 --> 11:12.105
it's a very tall child
dressed as Joe MacMillan.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.942
Batman was sold out.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.877
Can I come in?

11:18.211 --> 11:20.047
Yeah.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.950
( TV playing
in background )

11:27.087 --> 11:28.421
It's a good color.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.059
It's a work in progress.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.430
So, what's going on?

11:37.464 --> 11:40.033
I assume you're not
here for the candy?

11:43.436 --> 11:45.105
I've got a problem.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.442
It sounds like you got
a lot of problems.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.746
I mean, unless it's true
there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.114
I'm--

11:54.147 --> 11:56.183
I'm not responsible
for the leak.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.219
I, yeah, figured.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.089
You know,
clearly it was someone
with actual skills.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.293
I just mean
obviously it was Ryan.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.864
I need to find him
and he's off the grid.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.366
The feds are calling me
every week.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.903
I bet, probably because
every chat room online

12:15.936 --> 12:17.771
thinks you're some kind of
8-bit Robin Hood.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.940
I didn't make
Ryan do this.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.977
Yeah, I know.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.413
It's hard to make
Ryan do anything.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.483
If you could send out
a kind of flare--

12:30.517 --> 12:33.486
I mean, Ryan's talented,
but if anyone can track him...

12:35.522 --> 12:36.924
Oh...

12:36.957 --> 12:38.258
are you gonna
turn him in?

12:38.291 --> 12:41.128
No, I'm worried
about him.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.831
He's running out
of options.

12:48.001 --> 12:51.004
- ( screaming on TV )
- Man: Oh, my God!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.573
Sorry.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.809
( TV turns off )

12:55.843 --> 12:58.178
( laughs )

12:58.211 --> 13:00.580
How are you doing?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.249
Never better,

13:02.282 --> 13:04.484
as I'm sure you can see.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.420
Well, look at us.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.189
Two unemployed CEOs

13:09.222 --> 13:11.224
both ousted
from our companies.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.094
Mine's toast
and yours is going public.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.929
Mm-hmm.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.168
Gordon told me.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.275
Yeah.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.348
I'm working
with Gordon now.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.354
Really?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.456
( laughs )

13:43.490 --> 13:46.059
Now, there's a twist.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.130
You were right.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.232
I needed to give him credit

13:52.265 --> 13:53.533
and include him,

13:53.566 --> 13:55.435
and we're working
on something

13:55.468 --> 13:58.872
that I'm really
excited about.

13:58.906 --> 14:01.108
So, uh, thank you
for that.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.346
Yeah, well...

14:06.379 --> 14:07.981
thank you.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.118
Oh.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.886
Hmm.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.387
Him.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.490
Well, you picked
a good guy.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.396
He's lucky.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.533
No, I'm pretty sure
right now I'm just
making him miserable.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.435
( laughs )

14:28.468 --> 14:31.972
Oh, I haven't
seen one of these
since I was a kid.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.242
That's scary.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.476
Yeah.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.378
I had to zap it
'cause of Halloween.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.048
I didn't want those
little wieners getting stung.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.986
Yeah.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.189
Yeah.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.537
I'd appreciate
your help with Ryan.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.245
- ( door opens )
- Hey, Joe.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.647
Here.
Trick or treat.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.583
( laughing )

15:29.062 --> 15:30.497
( ringing )

15:30.530 --> 15:31.999
Clark residence.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.567
Hi, sweetheart.
How's your costume?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.236
Good.
A little itchy.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.205
And my teacher said
I have to call my spear

15:38.238 --> 15:39.639
a walking stick.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.608
Why?

15:41.641 --> 15:44.011
I don't know.
Kids aren't supposed
to have spears?

15:44.044 --> 15:46.079
Well, can they have
imaginary spears?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.480
I don't know.
I didn't ask that.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.748
Well, you tell her--

15:48.781 --> 15:50.683
Daddy,
Mommy's on the phone!

15:50.717 --> 15:54.221
Haley?
Have the best time,
okay, sweetheart?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.327
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.429
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.597
I think I did all right today.
How are things over there?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.733
Great.
Everything's great.

16:06.766 --> 16:10.370
- Joanie: No, a braid.
- Is that Joanie?
Can I talk to her?

16:10.403 --> 16:12.205
Hey, Mom wants
to talk to you.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.007
Not while you're braiding.
It'll be all lopsided.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.475
- All right.
- That's okay.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.445
Just tell her
to have fun,
all right?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.047
What's she going as?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.748
Joan Montana.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.317
( laughing )
Take pictures, okay?

16:24.351 --> 16:25.485
Mm-hmm.
Will do.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.090
Gordon,
I-- I miss you.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.725
Yep, miss you, too.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.261
Hurry up, Daddy.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.996
( dial tone )

16:42.735 --> 16:44.504
"Blue Dream" playing

16:44.537 --> 16:47.174
* We go out,
the people are starin' *

16:47.207 --> 16:50.510
* No sense, you don't
know how to deal with it *

16:50.543 --> 16:54.614
* You wake up back in bed
with a blue dream *

16:54.647 --> 16:57.517
* A blue dream

16:59.552 --> 17:01.154
* A blue dream

17:01.188 --> 17:03.723
* A blue dream

17:06.326 --> 17:09.162
* I went down to the club
on a Saturday... *

17:13.633 --> 17:18.138
Gordon: Two kids,
three-ring circus.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.208
Haley's like
a tiny prosecutor.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.611
She kept coming down here
to offer evidence against
her sister.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.746
Yeah, Joanie's too scary
to convict.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.249
Her teenage self
is lurking on the horizon

17:29.282 --> 17:32.119
like some post-apocalyptic
ravager.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.121
Ravager, huh?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.389
You have no idea.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.526
So, um, I was hoping
you had heard some news.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.730
I haven't heard from him.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.098
Oh.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.469
Can I ask you
a question?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.605
Were--

17:52.639 --> 17:55.542
were you and Ryan, um,

17:55.575 --> 17:59.612
ever, uh...
you know.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.149
What?

18:02.182 --> 18:05.585
Um, did you...

18:05.618 --> 18:07.387
you know...?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.791
You know?

18:11.824 --> 18:12.859
What?

18:14.161 --> 18:16.763
You know, were--

18:16.796 --> 18:18.531
were you, you know,

18:18.565 --> 18:21.368
more than... friends?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.707
You know?

18:27.740 --> 18:30.743
I never had those
feelings for Ryan.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.345
Ah.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.350
Actually,

18:37.384 --> 18:38.818
he kind of
reminds me of you.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.354
Oh, come on,
please don't say that.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.390
That's-- I don't know
how to respond to that.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.925
- Uh...
- ( laughing )

18:45.958 --> 18:48.428
Stop messing with me.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.569
You should move forward
with the NSFNET project alone.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.307
Wh-what?
What are you talking about?

19:00.340 --> 19:01.874
I don't want
to hold you back.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.810
You're not holding me back.
You're helping me.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.213
Gordon,
Mitch was pretty clear
about this.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.914
- Joe, please don't do this.
- You know how these
things work.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.283
- If you miss the window--
- I can't do it alone.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.385
Yes, you can.
Don't sell yourself short.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.890
I'm sick, Joe.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.296
- I'm sick.
- What-- what the hell
does that mean?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.232
- ( telephone rings )
- Hang on real quick.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.933
- Gordon?
- Hang on, I gotta get this.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.535
- Leave it.
- Look, it could be Donna.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.869
Just give me two secs.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.471
Hello?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.676
Now?
No, I got the kids. I--

19:39.312 --> 19:43.616
All right, look, I'll--
I'll figure something out.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.784
Yep.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.819
Yep.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.488
( sighs )
That was Mutiny.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.623
They need me to--
it doesn't--

19:50.657 --> 19:52.492
we need to talk,
all right?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.461
But right now I need
a favor from you.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.429
You're not going anywhere
until you tell me
what's going on.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.398
- Look, I can't.
I gotta go--
- Sit down.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.402
Sit.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.837
Ryan.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.710
Ryan. Ryan!

20:43.743 --> 20:45.745
How'd you find me?

20:45.778 --> 20:47.046
Uh...

20:47.079 --> 20:49.916
I put up
the "Are You Safe"
board on Mutiny.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.551
You logged in remotely
through an FTP connection--

20:51.584 --> 20:53.586
You wrote a software trap

20:53.620 --> 20:57.390
alerting you to my activity,
including the university
mainlines.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.893
( groans )
I should have
thought about that.

21:00.927 --> 21:04.464
Hey, I'm not here
to bust you or anything.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.601
Joe wants to help you.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.303
I-- I want to help you.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.606
Hey, you--

21:13.640 --> 21:16.476
Ryan, you can't live off
Dr Pepper and Cheez-Its
forever.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.311
Believe me, I've tried.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.916
Where have you been?

21:23.950 --> 21:26.486
I crashed with friends
for a while.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.489
The cops,
they keep tracking me.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.057
Uh, how did you know?

21:31.090 --> 21:33.059
I could feel it.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.061
Somebody was following me.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.629
And-- and my buddy,

21:36.663 --> 21:38.865
he kept getting
these weird phone calls.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.500
Yeah.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.937
And, um,

21:44.971 --> 21:47.106
I took the bus
down to San Diego

21:47.139 --> 21:50.910
and, um, stayed
with my cousin.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.745
He's a wannabe tech guy
and a total asshole.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.781
He said he wouldn't
rat me out, but I--

21:54.814 --> 21:57.049
I knew he would,
you know?

22:00.152 --> 22:03.456
I hitched a ride
back to SF.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.426
I needed a cup of coffee
and a computer, so...

22:06.459 --> 22:09.028
I blended in right here.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.930
It's like I'm invisible.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.834
Joe probably hates me now.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.936
Oh, no.
( scoffs )

22:16.969 --> 22:18.771
No, and even
if he is pissed,

22:18.805 --> 22:20.373
he'll get over it.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.576
Joe can be...

22:23.610 --> 22:26.613
surprisingly forgiving.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.581
Maybe it's because he's screwed
up his own life so many times.

22:31.484 --> 22:36.122
Hey, if you don't want me
to tell him where you are,
I won't.

22:36.155 --> 22:40.527
But he really just wants
to walk you through
your options.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.996
He's worried about you.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.932
And look,

22:45.965 --> 22:47.800
I found you,

22:47.834 --> 22:51.404
so... you can't hide
forever.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.144
I thought you were gonna
bring the girlies along.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.079
No.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.114
Found a great new sitter.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.383
Really flexible.

23:09.155 --> 23:12.759
Well, thanks for
bailing me out.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.795
I didn't want to worry Donna
on the eve of her big day.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.665
Yeah.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.633
What you gonna do
with your share of the IPO?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.835
I don't know.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.837
I guess I should
make some plans.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.006
You know, they're saying
it's gonna open at 15.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.442
Ha, 15.

23:29.476 --> 23:32.579
Who'd have thunk it?

23:32.612 --> 23:34.947
What are you gonna do
with your share?

23:34.981 --> 23:38.050
Oh, stash away some
for a college fund
type of thing

23:38.084 --> 23:40.587
for my grandson.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.556
That is, if that's
all right with James.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.925
Yeah?
Why wouldn't it be?

23:45.958 --> 23:46.993
Well...

23:48.695 --> 23:51.998
you never know
what might hit a nerve.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.165
All right.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.504
You talk to Cam?

23:57.537 --> 23:59.672
No.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.207
You?

24:01.240 --> 24:02.575
Nope.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.644
But...

24:04.677 --> 24:06.546
she'll be a millionaire
tomorrow.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.147
She can't be
too sorry about that.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.720
- Hey, here's
to going public.
- To going public.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.188
- ( car door opens )
- Tom: Yeah, you bet.
Thanks so much.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.890
- ( car door closes )
- Man: No problem.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.759
( car departs )

24:19.792 --> 24:22.629
Well, look at you.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.697
Waiting for me
at the front door.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.065
Mm-hmm.

24:26.098 --> 24:29.836
We're one apron away
from a lifelong fantasy.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.604
( laughing )

24:33.973 --> 24:35.608
I have a proposition
for you.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.043
Can I show you
something first?

24:37.076 --> 24:39.478
- Mmm, yeah.
- Okay, good.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.520
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.556
It's called
the "Spacebike Chronicles."

24:49.589 --> 24:51.858
- Okay.
- This is our hero.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.160
She doesn't have a name.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.663
And she's just
cruising through

24:56.696 --> 25:00.232
the post-apocalyptic future
on her bad-ass space-bike.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.870
And all she needs to survive
are gas, candy,

25:03.903 --> 25:06.539
and the occasional
long, hot shower.

25:06.573 --> 25:09.676
So, she travels
to planets and asteroids

25:09.709 --> 25:11.177
and space stations
trying to get what she needs.

25:11.210 --> 25:14.814
Oh! And when she arrives
at a new place,

25:14.847 --> 25:17.083
she tries to win
one of the five senses.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.318
Each one arms her
with a different power.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.922
A sense of proportion
allows her to change size.

25:22.955 --> 25:26.826
A sense of humor
allows her to fend off
most forms of attack.

25:26.859 --> 25:31.798
A sense of self
allows her to appear
and disappear.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.601
Okay, well,
decency doesn't give her
an actual power,

25:34.634 --> 25:37.837
but it makes it possible
for her to win

25:37.870 --> 25:39.939
the rarest sense of all--

25:39.972 --> 25:41.908
common sense,

25:41.941 --> 25:44.744
which lets her see
everything more clearly.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.713
It's beautiful.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.147
( laughs )

25:48.180 --> 25:49.916
How do you win?

25:51.618 --> 25:53.986
You don't, you just
get to keep playing.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.826
I love it.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.098
Come here.
Come here, come up.

26:10.970 --> 26:15.041
Do you want to hear,
uh, the proposition?

26:15.074 --> 26:16.876
Mm-hmm.

26:19.378 --> 26:22.782
How do you feel
about moving to Japan?

26:24.884 --> 26:27.253
( laughs )
What?

26:27.286 --> 26:29.856
They want to move me up.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.992
All the way to Tokyo.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.200
That's perfect.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.104
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.727
Ryan?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.428
Why'd you lie to me?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.664
Why'd you cut me out?

27:11.698 --> 27:13.833
I didn't do either
of those things.

27:13.866 --> 27:17.369
- I planned to bring you in.
- Bring me in?

27:17.403 --> 27:19.338
I created the whole thing.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.273
I put the code out there,

27:21.307 --> 27:22.875
really made it free
when you didn't have

27:22.909 --> 27:24.877
the guts
to do it yourself.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.780
And I've been
out there ever since,
defending your name,

27:27.814 --> 27:29.081
telling the real story.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.418
I've been worried
about you.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.926
Hey, sit down.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.396
I know you're angry,
just admit it.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.932
I'm not.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.701
I wish you hadn't upset
the NSFNET deal.

27:48.735 --> 27:51.070
You've made things
much harder.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.905
But that
is less important

27:52.939 --> 27:55.107
than knowing
that you're okay.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.411
As I see it,

27:59.445 --> 28:01.814
you've got two options.

28:01.848 --> 28:06.085
You can turn yourself in
and own up to what you did...

28:08.354 --> 28:10.256
or you can run.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.727
Either way,

28:14.761 --> 28:16.763
I will help you.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.201
How?

28:22.234 --> 28:25.137
If you run,

28:25.171 --> 28:27.907
I'll give you 50 grand,
drive you to the bus station

28:27.940 --> 28:31.210
and you can disappear.

28:31.243 --> 28:35.748
But the network
you and I created

28:35.782 --> 28:37.216
will disappear, too.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.885
No, I don't want that.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.457
I put in a call
to my lawyer.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.393
If you turn yourself in,

28:47.426 --> 28:50.062
you'll serve no more
than a year or two.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.931
No, I can't.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.299
Listen to me.

28:53.332 --> 28:56.368
A hacker
that violates the CFAA

28:56.402 --> 28:58.838
can't touch a computer
for at least five years--

28:58.871 --> 29:01.007
Five years?
That's insane!

29:03.142 --> 29:04.877
And that's
an impossible choice!

29:04.911 --> 29:06.378
It's better than
10 years in prison.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.781
That's the maximum.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.382
I know it sounds
like a long time,

29:10.416 --> 29:12.218
but you're young,
and it's like you told me,

29:12.251 --> 29:14.286
destruction leads
to transformation.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.289
You've got plenty of time
to reinvent yourself.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.393
Yeah, that's what
I want to do.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.963
Start again with you,
like when you first hired me.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.833
We sat right here
making shit up,

29:26.866 --> 29:28.334
writing ideas
on the board.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.806
Okay, all right.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.044
Fine.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.179
Let's say I--

29:40.212 --> 29:42.548
I do what you say

29:42.581 --> 29:44.316
and I serve my time.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.254
Tell me we can
still work together.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.093
That's not possible.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.329
But you would have done
the same thing.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.198
You're a master
at this kind of move.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.599
It's classic
Joe MacMillan.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.235
I can't work with
Joe MacMillan anymore.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.837
( chair clatters )

30:12.278 --> 30:14.881
Fine.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.548
I'll do this
with or without you.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.250
I hope you do.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.989
You're a hypocrite
and you always have been.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.403
You don't have to
decide tonight.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.174
I want you to sleep here

30:42.208 --> 30:43.976
and we can talk more
in the morning.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.879
But you need
some rest, Ryan.

30:49.215 --> 30:52.518
I'll get some sheets
and we can make up the sofa.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.459
( sighs )

31:11.303 --> 31:13.405
Where would madam
like the tray?

31:13.439 --> 31:15.207
Oh, uh,
on the bed, please.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.033
Will there be
anything else?

31:41.067 --> 31:42.634
No, thank you.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.442
- ( knocks )
- Diane: Donna?

31:51.543 --> 31:53.245
How'd you sleep?

31:53.279 --> 31:55.714
Oh, horribly,
but I didn't
really mind.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.249
The sheets
were so comfortable.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.218
Have you eaten breakfast?

31:59.251 --> 32:01.553
Oh, no, no.
I don't do breakfast
when I'm nervous.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.055
I do.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.290
I'm gonna be on TV

32:04.323 --> 32:05.724
and then my company's
going public.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.293
You're gonna be great.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.228
You always say that.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.662
No, you are.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.031
You're gonna be great.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.968
( Diane laughs )

32:18.237 --> 32:20.372
So, just look directly
into it like it's a person.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.108
Lynda will be able
to see you.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.709
Her voice will come
into your earpiece.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.711
There will be a bit
of a sound delay.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.479
Any questions?

32:30.282 --> 32:31.617
Five away.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.326
All right,
come on, guys.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.028
I wanna go
back to bed.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.396
I know, but we gotta
get up and watch Mommy.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.232
All right?
It's her big day.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.666
I'll make you guys
some breakfast

32:47.699 --> 32:50.536
in just
a little bit, okay?

32:50.569 --> 32:52.738
All right, you guys
get on the couch.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.786
( TV playing )

33:07.819 --> 33:09.521
- Come on, hop up.
- ( groans )

33:09.555 --> 33:11.623
Gotta make
some room for Daddy.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.792
Lynda:
Welcome back
to "Financial Watch AM."

33:13.825 --> 33:16.095
This morning we have
with us Donna Clark,

33:16.128 --> 33:18.430
CEO of Mutiny,
a trailblazer

33:18.464 --> 33:20.732
in the brave new world
of online shopping.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.269
- Welcome, Donna.
- Look, it's Mommy.

33:23.302 --> 33:24.703
Lynda:
Thanks to people
like our guest,

33:24.736 --> 33:26.338
for the 25 million
Americans

33:26.372 --> 33:28.140
who own
personal computers,

33:28.174 --> 33:31.310
Christmas shopping
is just a keystroke away.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.179
- So, Donna...
- Haley: She looks so pretty.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.813
a woman who founded
a tech company.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.283
You're something
of an anomaly, aren't you?

33:37.316 --> 33:39.218
Well, actually,
Mutiny was founded

33:39.251 --> 33:41.287
by my former partner,
Cameron Howe.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.489
Ah, I see.
And where is he?

33:43.522 --> 33:46.258
Uh, s is no longer
with the company.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.194
So, it was founded
by a woman?

33:48.227 --> 33:49.528
Yes.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.630
Lynda:
So, how does it work,

33:51.663 --> 33:54.200
this new e-tail phenomenon?

33:54.233 --> 33:56.268
It's very simple, really.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.470
Most home computers
are connected

33:58.504 --> 34:00.239
to something
called a modem.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.074
That's a device
which uses--

34:02.108 --> 34:04.076
Oh, dear,
it's sounding complicated.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.744
It isn't, really--

34:05.777 --> 34:08.714
Bottom line--
can I buy my shoes with it?

34:08.747 --> 34:10.849
Yes, absolutely.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.852
We're in partnership
with several retailers and--

34:13.885 --> 34:16.188
Lynda:
Finally, something
about computers

34:16.222 --> 34:17.623
to get excited about.

34:17.656 --> 34:21.260
So, how exactly
would I buy my shoes?

34:21.293 --> 34:23.662
Donna:
Well, you would log on
to Mutiny and from the home--

34:23.695 --> 34:26.365
We intercepted
the ticker feed
from phone lines.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.733
Going into a bank.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.801
And then rerouted
to the office modem.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.370
- Ah!
- Yeah.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.172
Well, that sounds
entirely legal.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.740
Sure.

34:34.773 --> 34:37.143
Okay, for the record
I had no prior knowledge
of this plan.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.844
- ( laughter )
- Shit.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.512
Oh, come on.
Rookie move, son.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.448
What are you doing?
Sailboat?

34:42.481 --> 34:44.416
Don't spend your money
before you've made it.

34:44.450 --> 34:47.153
- Coder: What a dweeb!
- ( coders laughing )

34:47.186 --> 34:49.721
Okay, look.
So, the companies debuting
today come out first.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.423
Lev:
How many are there?

34:51.457 --> 34:54.193
I don't know.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.827
- Oh, here we go.
Here we go.
- Hey, look at that.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.796
Bodie:
Money, money, money.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.806
Okay, here we go.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.683
Okay, it's a little lower
than we expected.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.518
Just breathe.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.564
( all sighing )

35:42.808 --> 35:44.543
( sighs )

35:49.815 --> 35:52.684
Joanie:
Can we call Mommy yet?

35:52.718 --> 35:56.222
Uh, I think we're gonna
wait a little.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.647
Do you wanna know?

36:25.584 --> 36:28.554
Just... tell me
if it's good or bad.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.632
( sighs )

36:42.734 --> 36:44.503
I know
it's a morale blow.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.905
I get it.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.308
But it doesn't mean
that the stock
is worthless.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.777
It's just not worth
what we thought.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.946
It could be
the pace of our growth.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.583
It could be
a Commodore issue.

36:57.616 --> 37:01.253
They had
a horrible quarter.

37:01.287 --> 37:03.555
Or just a calendar thing.
There are all sorts
of schools of--

37:03.589 --> 37:06.558
Can I, um--
can I have a minute?

37:32.050 --> 37:36.722
( door opens, closes )

37:38.857 --> 37:41.327
( breathing heavily )

38:01.380 --> 38:02.648
( knocking on door )

38:10.422 --> 38:12.424
( knocking continues )

38:27.573 --> 38:31.377
Mr. MacMillan,
we need to come in.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.978
What's this about?

38:33.011 --> 38:34.980
Was Ryan Ray
in your apartment
last night?

38:35.013 --> 38:37.115
Yeah.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.850
But he's gone now.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.952
I don't know where he is.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.655
Sir, why don't
you sit down?

39:09.047 --> 39:12.584
( distant sirens wailing )

39:39.177 --> 39:42.614
Gordon:
Look, Joe,

39:42.648 --> 39:44.916
how many times
are you going to read that?

39:48.086 --> 39:50.889
He wrote it right here

39:50.922 --> 39:52.858
while I was sleeping.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.439
I can't profit from this.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.710
No.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.546
No, it was your idea.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.815
Okay? I'll--
I'll wait for you.

40:16.848 --> 40:19.117
You know? I'll see
if I can stall things.

40:19.150 --> 40:22.554
Yeah, you shouldn't
want to work with me.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.160
The night I was--

40:29.194 --> 40:31.062
stood out there
with Ryan,

40:31.096 --> 40:33.098
we talked about...

40:36.034 --> 40:37.836
God, I don't know
what I was saying.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.805
Look, that's--

40:39.838 --> 40:41.840
that's not why.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.043
Jesus Christ.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.982
I was trying to help him.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.488
What are you gonna do?

40:56.522 --> 40:58.624
I don't know.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.562
I can't keep having
this conversation.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.233
I'm done.

41:24.750 --> 41:25.851
Hey, Gordon.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.123
I'm sorry.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.312
Are you sure you don't
want to postpone?

41:54.345 --> 41:56.715
I don't know
if there's a funeral.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.283
No, let's go.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.901
Are you sure?
'Cause we can
change our flight.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.003
Tom, I'm fine.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.605
Okay?

42:19.638 --> 42:21.873
I'm ready to leave
this place.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.123
You know...

42:39.324 --> 42:41.693
( sighs )

42:41.727 --> 42:44.295
God, maybe...

42:44.329 --> 42:47.999
there will be some things
that they won't have

42:48.033 --> 42:50.001
- in Japan.
- Yeah?

42:50.035 --> 42:52.070
Yeah, maybe I should

42:52.103 --> 42:54.139
go to the store
and just...

42:56.174 --> 42:58.176
make sure that we have

42:58.209 --> 43:00.111
everything we need.

43:00.145 --> 43:03.014
Yeah, of course.
Good idea.

43:03.048 --> 43:04.349
You want me
to go with you?

43:04.382 --> 43:06.752
No, I'll go.

43:06.785 --> 43:08.119
Okay.

43:13.191 --> 43:14.793
Ryan's voice:
"I, Ryan Ray, released

43:14.826 --> 43:17.228
the MacMillan Utility
source code.

43:17.262 --> 43:19.164
I acted alone.

43:19.197 --> 43:22.868
No one helped me,
and no one told me to do it.

43:22.901 --> 43:26.404
I did this because
'security' is a myth.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.841
Contrary to what you might
have heard, my friends,

43:29.875 --> 43:33.211
you are not safe.

43:33.244 --> 43:35.246
Safety is a story.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.115
It's something
we teach our children

43:37.148 --> 43:39.217
so they can sleep at night,

43:39.250 --> 43:41.119
but we know it's not real.

43:43.288 --> 43:46.658
Beware,
baffled humans.

43:46.692 --> 43:50.161
Beware of false prophets
who will sell you
a fake future,

43:50.195 --> 43:52.898
of bad teachers,
corrupt leaders

43:52.931 --> 43:54.933
and dirty corporations.

43:56.234 --> 43:58.336
Beware of cops
and robbers...

44:00.371 --> 44:04.075
the kind that rob
your dreams.

44:04.109 --> 44:05.811
But most of all,

44:05.844 --> 44:08.847
beware of each other,

44:08.880 --> 44:11.416
because everything's
about to change.

44:13.719 --> 44:16.922
The world is going
to crack wide open.

44:16.955 --> 44:20.191
There's something
on the horizon.

44:20.225 --> 44:23.194
A massive connectivity.

44:23.228 --> 44:26.364
The barriers between us
will disappear,

44:26.397 --> 44:28.867
and we're not ready.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.870
We'll hurt each other
in new ways.

44:31.903 --> 44:34.339
We'll sell and be sold.

44:34.372 --> 44:36.374
We'll expose
our most tender selves,

44:36.407 --> 44:39.177
only to be mocked
and destroyed.

44:41.146 --> 44:43.114
We'll be so vulnerable,

44:43.148 --> 44:45.250
and we'll pay the price.

44:45.283 --> 44:46.885
We won't be able
to pretend

44:46.918 --> 44:49.387
that we can protect
ourselves anymore.

44:51.422 --> 44:53.725
It's a huge danger,

44:53.759 --> 44:55.861
a gigantic risk,

44:55.894 --> 44:58.429
but it's worth it.

44:58.463 --> 45:02.033
If only we can learn
to take care of each other.

45:02.067 --> 45:04.369
Then this awesome,
destructive new connection

45:04.402 --> 45:07.238
won't isolate us.

45:07.272 --> 45:10.441
It won't leave us
in the end so...

45:10.475 --> 45:12.377
totally alone.

45:13.478 --> 45:16.147
( seagulls screeching )

45:29.194 --> 45:31.396
( seagulls screeching )

45:41.372 --> 45:45.110
( waves crashing )
