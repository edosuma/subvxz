MOLLIE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:30.497
I TOLD THEM THAT THERE WAS A
FAMILY EMERGENCY.

01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:32.630
-MOLLIE,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
-NO, JIMMY, YOU'RE THE ONE

01:08:32.673 --> 01:08:35.154
-WHO SHOULDN'T BE HERE. IT'S
TOO DANGEROUS TO FLY TONIGHT.
-OH, MOLLIE, I'VE TOLD YOU A

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:37.417
MILLION TIMES. WE FLY AROUND
THE WEATHER.

01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:40.725
THAT'S JUST IT! YOU CAN'T FLY
AROUND IT THIS TIME. IT'S LIKE
WALL-TO-WALL STORMS OUT THERE.

01:08:40.768 --> 01:08:42.553
DIDN'T YOU LISTEN
TO THE NEWS?

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:45.077
-HONEY, THE NEWS ALWAYS
UPSETS YOU.
-ALL RIGHT, FORGET THE NEWS.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.776
LET'S JUST SAY THAT I HAVE
THIS GUT FEELING THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T BE UP THERE!

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:51.256
WELL WE DON'T NEED YOUR GUT
FEELING, WE'VE GO
SOPHISTICATED INSTRUMENTS

01:08:51.301 --> 01:08:53.607
THAT TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE I
CAN GO AND WHERE
I CAN'T GO.

01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:56.349
NOW I GOT MY CLEARANCE, AND
I'M LEAVING. SO WOULD YOU
PLEASE GO?

01:08:56.393 --> 01:08:58.395
-I'M NOT LEAVING THIS PLANE
WITHOUT YOU.
-MOLLIE, GET OUT.

01:08:58.438 --> 01:09:00.962
-I'M NOT LEAVING.
-GET OUT!
-NO!

01:09:01.006 --> 01:09:03.617
FOUR SEVEN PAPA, DUE TO
ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS,
WE'RE CANCELING ALL FLIGHTS

01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:06.011

01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:11.799
OKAY THAT'S FOUR SEVEN PAPA.

01:09:11.843 --> 01:09:13.497

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.194
SO. I GUESS THIS TIME YOUR
FEELING IS RIGHT, HUH?

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:17.979
DOES IT MAKE YOU HAPPY?

01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:21.635
JIMMY...

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:26.073
I LOVE YOU. I DON'T CARE
ANYMORE IF I'M RIGHT
OR WRONG.

01:09:26.118 --> 01:09:29.948
[LAUGHS]
YOU DO TOO, YOU LIAR.

01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:34.779
WELL, I SORT OF LIKE BEING
RIGHT. BUT I DO LOVE YOU.

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:39.827
I LOVE YOU TOO.

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:56.409

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:01.893
BOMBS AWAY!

01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:06.376
A LITTLE NAPALM OUGHTTA
SLOW YOU DOWN, COLONEL!

01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:09.074
THANK GOD THEY LEFT ME WITH A
RESPONSIBLE ADULT.

01:10:20.128 --> 01:10:22.609
-CHAAAARGE! I GOT YOU!
-OH NO!

01:10:22.653 --> 01:10:25.917
YOU ARE MY PRISONER!

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.268
OKAY! I GIVE UP! I SURRENDER!

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:31.836
YEAH? HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
SQUIRT IN THE NOSTRIL?

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:37.494
THIS AIN'T OVER.
THIS AIN'T OVER.

01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:39.757
I'LL GET MY TROOPS TOGETHER,
AND WE'LL BE BACK.

01:10:56.034 --> 01:10:58.123
MIKEY, WATCH JULIE, OKAY?

01:10:59.994 --> 01:11:02.040
WHY, IS SHE GONNA DO
SOMETHING BESIDES SLOBBER?

01:11:11.658 --> 01:11:13.312
AUUUGH! FREEZE!

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:15.706
OKAY. PUT THE BAG DOWN.

01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:17.751
SLOW, AND NOBODY'S GOING
TO GET HURT.

01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:19.057
PUT THE BAG DOWN.

01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:33.941
HEY! STOP!

01:11:57.704 --> 01:12:01.491
-MM, THE KIDS ARE GOING TO BE
SO EXCITED.
-WHO'S TAKING CARE OF THEM?

01:12:01.534 --> 01:12:03.667
-STEWART.
-STEWART?

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:06.583
-AW, NO. WHAT ARE YA, NUTS?
-DON'T WORRY, EVERYTHING'S

01:12:10.674 --> 01:12:12.980

MIKEY, THIS STUFF IS SCARY!

01:12:42.488 --> 01:12:46.492
-IT'S OKAY, JULIE.
-I'M AFRAID!
-I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:49.060
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT
BONEHEAD UNCLE STEWART IS.

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:52.106
-NOW JUST KEEP YOUR HANDS IN,
JULIE. DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING!
-MIKEY, IT'S HOT!

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:10.081
HEY, WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:12.866
-WELL WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO

-OH WHAT ARE TALKING ABOUT?

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:14.564
STEWART, WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

01:13:14.607 --> 01:13:16.566
THEY'RE UPSTAIRS.

01:13:16.609 --> 01:13:18.959
[GASPS]
OH MY GOD!

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:23.529
I'LL TAKE THE STAIRS.

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.406
OKAY HERE WE GO,
I THINK WE'RE SAFE.

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:32.843
-WHOA, THAT WAS CLOSE.
-HOW DID YOU GET DOWN HERE?

01:13:32.886 --> 01:13:34.453
WE JUST WALKED.

01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:37.108
TECHNICALLY, I WAS PUSHED

01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:39.545
-HONEY, GET HIM OUT AND CALL
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
-OKAY, COME ON, BABY.

01:13:58.782 --> 01:14:02.089
TURN, THEN PRESS...
WHOA!

01:14:11.272 --> 01:14:15.538
YES! YES!

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:19.498
SO I CHASE HIM ALL THE WAY
DOWN UNTIL HE LANDED ON SOME
FIRE ESCAPE

01:14:19.542 --> 01:14:23.937
CHASE HIM DOWN THROUGH THIS
THING, I JUMP ON THE GUY,
AND THEN I SUCKER PUNCHED HIM.

01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:27.332
HE'S AMAZING! ISN'T HE?

01:14:27.375 --> 01:14:30.596
-OH, STEWART,

-YEAH!

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.903
ALL YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY LUCKY
THE FIRE DIDN'T SPREAD BEYOND
THE KITCHEN!

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:35.514
YEAH WELL THANK GOD I GOT
THAT FIRE EXTINGUISHER!

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:38.299
I WAS THE ONE WHO GOT THE
FIR EXTINGUISHER.

01:14:38.343 --> 01:14:40.563
-I GOT THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER!
-NO, I GOT THE
FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:44.305
WHO LEFT THE KIDS WITH
STEWART? THAT WAS A PRETTY
BONEHEAD IDEA, HUH?

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:47.265
OH... YEAH.

01:14:48.048 --> 01:14:50.442
GOOD ANSWER.

01:14:56.056 --> 01:14:59.016
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU
BARBECUING ALL THE TIME.

01:14:59.059 --> 01:15:01.975
-OH, WILL YOU RELAX?
-IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD FOR THE
ENVIRONMENT, MOM.

01:15:02.019 --> 01:15:07.677
WE JUST GOT ONE OF THESE
BRAND-NEW OUTDOOR ELECTRIC
STOVES, AND THEY'RE...

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.549
NO, THEY DON'T DO
ANYTHING BAD!

01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:13.596
YOU'VE GOTTEN TO BE SUCH A
NUDGE, I DON'T KNOW HOW...

01:15:13.639 --> 01:15:20.298
[INDISTINGUISHABLE BICKERING]

01:15:24.955 --> 01:15:30.830
MIKEY, OKAY. YOU GOT ME OUT
OF THE HOT STUFF.
I DON'T GET IT.

01:15:30.874 --> 01:15:34.225
WELL NOW, LISTEN. YOU KNOW,
HOT STUFF CAN BE VERY
BAD FOR YOU.

01:15:34.268 --> 01:15:36.923
IT'S ESPECIALLY NOT GOOD
FOR KIDS AT ALL.

01:15:36.967 --> 01:15:38.925
BUT I THOUGHT YOU HATED ME?

01:15:38.969 --> 01:15:41.232
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALWAYS MEAN

01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:44.801
YEAH, WELL, I DO HATE YOU

AND THERE'S THEM.

01:15:58.902 --> 01:16:01.861
YEAH, BIG ONES DON'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

01:16:01.905 --> 01:16:04.951
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT BIG
ONES ARE GONNA DO.

01:16:04.995 --> 01:16:08.128
-THAT'S FOR SURE. THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.
-YEAH!

01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:10.304

01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:12.872
YOU AND ME?

01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:15.527
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU AND ME.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.269
-WE'RE THE KIDS!
-YEAH!

01:16:22.795 --> 01:16:28.584
