00:01.102 --> 00:03.404
**

00:03.504 --> 00:06.240
I had a premonition
that all this will end

00:06.340 --> 00:10.111
with Principal Lewis
buying a mattress factory.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.579
Unbelievable
premonition.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.914
-Love those omens.
-Go, Billy!

00:17.017 --> 00:20.088
Oh, no.
It finally happened.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.056
Klaus got
the lunch lady job.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.591
Next.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.926
Oh, Steve!
It's me, Klaus!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.628
You know, from home?

00:27.728 --> 00:29.097
Oh, God,
don't talk to me.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.598
Come here, honey.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.467
I saved you the crustiest
corner of mac and cheese.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.569
It's so hard.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.638
Steve, I know
I should know this,

00:37.738 --> 00:39.540
but how are you
related to Klaus?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.075
I thought
they were a couple!

00:41.175 --> 00:42.943
I don't want to talk
about Klaus anymore.

00:43.043 --> 00:43.944
I can't even eat.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.246
(sniffs)

00:45.346 --> 00:46.947
Is someone having
Crepes Suzette?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.317
Ugh,
the hall monitors.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.252
I hate how they get
special treatment.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.320
Come on.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.289
Principal Lewis takes
troubled kids from juvie

00:55.389 --> 00:58.292
and molds them into
productive members of society.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.760
Yeah, they made
the cover

00:59.860 --> 01:02.663
of Appropriate Relationships
Magazine.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.433
(stomach grumbling)

01:05.533 --> 01:06.634
Uh-oh.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.237
(retching)

01:09.337 --> 01:11.605
(all retching)

01:17.945 --> 01:18.846
Wow.

01:19.012 --> 01:22.450
Look at how fast
the sawdust absorbs the puke.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.918
This is why
I became a janitor.

01:25.018 --> 01:27.155
I became a janitor
because it was fate.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.856
As you can see...

01:28.956 --> 01:32.193
this birthmark across my body
looks somewhat like a mop.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.962
(patriotic music plays)

01:35.062 --> 01:37.631
* Good morning, U.S.A. *

01:37.731 --> 01:41.502
* I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day *

01:41.602 --> 01:44.705
* The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face *

01:44.805 --> 01:49.009
* And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race *

01:50.944 --> 01:54.215
* Oh, boy, it's swell to say *

01:54.315 --> 01:56.484
-* Good -- *
-* Good morning, U.S.A. *

01:56.584 --> 01:57.818
Aah!

01:59.153 --> 02:02.490
* Good morning, U.S.A. *

02:02.590 --> 02:04.492
Well, they fired me.

02:04.592 --> 02:07.027
They blamed me for all
those kids getting sick.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.362
It's ridiculous.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.963
I always said "excuse me"

02:10.063 --> 02:12.166
when I farted into
the mashed potatoes.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.369
It is a little odd how often
students are throwing up.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.738
That was the third
puke-fest this month.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.573
And they always blame
a lunch lady.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.642
I was the eighth one
fired this year.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.911
Eighth...third.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.579
That's a lot of numbers.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.015
Maybe we should go take
a look around the cafeteria.

02:28.115 --> 02:33.987
**

02:34.087 --> 02:36.390
Whoa.
Sawdust.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.726
Hmm...

02:38.826 --> 02:41.829
Whoa.
Sawdust.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.197
Hmm...

02:43.297 --> 02:47.535
**

02:47.635 --> 02:48.769
That's odd.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.338
No sawdust.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.939
Or is it?

02:52.039 --> 02:53.040
What do you mean?

02:53.140 --> 02:55.175
I don't know.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.212
Just the usual dry-aged beef

02:58.312 --> 03:01.349
you'd find in any
public high school cafeteria.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.750
Unless...

03:04.685 --> 03:05.619
Hmm...

03:05.719 --> 03:06.954
MAN: Hey!
Who's in there?

03:07.054 --> 03:09.757
Hank Turlington,
school detective.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.924
We need to talk.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.626
And you need to walk.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.062
Me and my partner are also
school detectives,

03:15.162 --> 03:16.897
and we're already
on the case.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.966
Maybe we can join...

03:19.066 --> 03:19.967
forces.

03:20.067 --> 03:20.968
Maybe.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.303
Is that a yes?

03:22.403 --> 03:24.238
Yes.
We have joined forces.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.739
Three man handshake?

03:25.839 --> 03:26.774
Yes.

03:26.874 --> 03:27.808
Steve, please join us?

03:27.908 --> 03:28.809
Yes.

03:28.909 --> 03:32.580
**

03:35.115 --> 03:37.385
**

03:37.485 --> 03:40.454
Great idea to start
mall walking, Stan.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.456
Hey, what's the name
of Steve's tailor?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.392
-Petruchio?
-No, his other tailor.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.893
-Carbunkle.
-Yes, that's right.

03:45.993 --> 03:46.960
Hey, Carbunkle!

03:49.597 --> 03:50.664
(creaking, bone cracks)

03:50.764 --> 03:53.401
(screams)

03:59.273 --> 04:01.409
What's wrong, bud?
Looking a little pale.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.810
Lemme guess,
you saw the price

04:02.910 --> 04:04.578
of a pan
at Williams Sonoma.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.447
WOMAN: He's coming
back out the top!

04:06.547 --> 04:08.349
(squishing)

04:13.253 --> 04:14.588
Hey there, fellas.
You mall walking?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.089
I've always wanted
to try that out.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.426
Got room for one more?

04:18.526 --> 04:19.827
Guys?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.795
Eh, they're right, Al,
you'd just slow them down.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.532
So smile, you fat clown,
and walk away.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.334
Catch ya next time,
homies!

04:27.701 --> 04:30.137
**

04:30.237 --> 04:32.272
Something strange is
going on at this school,

04:32.373 --> 04:34.375
and it all centers
around Principal Lewis

04:34.475 --> 04:35.543
and the hall monitors.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.710
I've been working
undercover

04:36.810 --> 04:39.313
as social studies teacher
"Mrs. Womanface."

04:39.413 --> 04:41.148
I'm also the teacher
in charge of

04:41.248 --> 04:42.816
the Sadie Hawkins dance.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.151
This year's theme?

04:44.251 --> 04:45.819
"Everyone Must Get Laid."

04:45.919 --> 04:48.155
So, what can I do?
I-I want to help.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.523
With the sex dance?

04:49.623 --> 04:50.624
Or the school mystery?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.059
The...second thing.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.628
I need someone undercover
in the hall monitors.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.730
Lewis only
recruits bad kids.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.799
So you're about to get
sent to juvie.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.902
(body thuds, punching)

05:02.002 --> 05:05.172
Help!
A student is attacking me!

05:05.272 --> 05:06.640
-(thud)
-Wow.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.909
You think you know
all the things that turn you on,

05:09.009 --> 05:11.044
but then you see
something like this,

05:11.144 --> 05:13.180
and suddenly you're
at half-mast.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.082
Aah!

05:15.182 --> 05:16.650
It was this boy
right here.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.487
He overpowered me,
then he sat down.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.988
**

05:21.088 --> 05:22.055
(inmates "whoo"ing)

05:22.322 --> 05:24.191
TURLINGTON: AJ Slick, the head
of the hall monitors,

05:24.291 --> 05:26.326
has a brother in juvie,
TJ Slick.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.996
I pulled some strings
to make you his cellmate.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.764
That's the easy part.

05:30.864 --> 05:31.999
The hard part's gonna be

05:32.099 --> 05:34.101
getting this monster
to trust you.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.369
Trust fall!

05:36.336 --> 05:37.505
You passed my test.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.872
Now we're friends forever.

05:38.906 --> 05:39.840
(smooches)

05:39.940 --> 05:40.841
**

05:40.941 --> 05:42.443
STEVE: With TJ's trust earned,

05:42.543 --> 05:44.545
I spent the next month
in the yard.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.680
**

05:46.780 --> 05:49.082
GUARD: Steve Smith?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.584
You're gettin'
out today.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.852
Already?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.754
I've only been
slamming my gams.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.856
Didn't even get a chance
to jack my sides

05:55.956 --> 05:58.358
or fran my front
or clunk my neck.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.762
Klaus?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.398
I fell asleep
in your pocket.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.033
I've been in this
storage locker

06:06.133 --> 06:09.302
for a month surviving
on leaky AC unit drippings,

06:09.403 --> 06:14.107
rat piss, and, ucch,
coconut LaCroix.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.611
**

06:17.711 --> 06:22.249
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Steve Smith.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.918
Yeah, don't splooge
in your pants or anything.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.454
You wish.

06:26.554 --> 06:30.157
My anti-depressants make that
absolutely impossible.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.959
Told you
this guy's a dork.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.561
I thought that, too.

06:33.661 --> 06:36.296
But I heard you were tight
with my big bro in juvie.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.299
I think Steve should be
our new hall monitor.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.268
Yo, I don't know
about this guy, AJ.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.570
He seems like a narc.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.238
Oh, yeah?
Would a narc do this?

06:45.338 --> 06:47.007
Oh, hey, Steve.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.241
We miss yo--
Ooh!

06:48.341 --> 06:49.477
Aah!

06:49.577 --> 06:52.513
Aaah!

06:52.613 --> 06:54.114
Sorry!

06:54.214 --> 06:56.517
But I! Have to! Do this!

06:56.617 --> 06:59.687
Cold-blooded, Smith!

06:59.787 --> 07:01.522
Your cruel whispers
that we couldn't hear

07:01.622 --> 07:03.323
really added
insult to injury.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.659
Welcome to
the hall monitors, Smith.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.660
Here's your hat.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.596
Are the fanny packs part
of the uniform?

07:08.696 --> 07:10.598
Nah. They're part
of our bodies.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.165
You'll grow one, too.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.937
**

07:17.037 --> 07:19.673
Steve, forget class.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.274
You're a hall monitor.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.443
Lewis lets us
do whatever we want.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.812
You wanna go to my house
and watch

07:24.912 --> 07:27.615
Wall Street:
Money Never Sleeps on my bed?

07:27.715 --> 07:29.517
Oh, here we go.
Hall pass?

07:29.617 --> 07:30.684
Um...

07:30.784 --> 07:31.885
Aah!

07:31.985 --> 07:34.655
You remind me of a dog turd
I once stepped in.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.890
It got into all the grooves
of my shoe,

07:36.990 --> 07:39.392
and it took my mom weeks
to clean it.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.128
Yeah, Steve! Yeah!

07:41.228 --> 07:43.030
He's hiding something.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.966
Let's see what he's got
in that backpack.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.300
(zipper unzips)

07:47.400 --> 07:48.636
MERTZ: It's everything

07:48.736 --> 07:50.403
we need to make
a spaghetti dinner.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.205
Nice haul, Double S.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.007
Any chance you snagged
a cabernet?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.143
No, but I got
this kid's clarinet.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.011
Clarinet sounds
like cabernet.

07:58.111 --> 08:01.414
No, it don't!
Clarinet sound like this!

08:01.515 --> 08:04.017
(clarinet plays)

08:06.319 --> 08:08.922
**

08:10.724 --> 08:12.660
Aah!

08:12.760 --> 08:14.562
Klaus? What are you doing?

08:14.662 --> 08:16.396
What are you doing?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.398
You're supposed to be getting
clues for the school mystery,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.601
not becoming
a Richard-Grieco-type bad boy

08:20.701 --> 08:22.335
who plays
by his own rules.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.905
Klaus, I'm fine.
I-I'm undercover.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.106
It's all an act.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.875
I hope so.
You're supposed to be

08:27.975 --> 08:29.577
getting my lunch lady
job back.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.745
And hey, bro,
why you peeing

08:31.845 --> 08:33.747
in the stall
like a shy guy?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.016
Your dick's
super cool.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.018
(bell rings)

08:38.118 --> 08:39.252
PRINCIPAL LEWIS:
You guys sure about

08:39.352 --> 08:40.688
this goody-two-shoes?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.756
I don't trust you,
Smith.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.058
Maybe you need
a little test.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.426
Jerk off in front
of these prudes.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.128
-What?
-Yo, we've been over this.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.931
You can't ask kids to jerk off
to prove their loyalty.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.366
Fine.
Option two --

08:53.466 --> 08:55.535
go to this pet store tonight
and vandalize it.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.037
Why this pet store?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.272
Because years ago,
I bought a pet gecko there

08:59.372 --> 09:00.407
and it bit me.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.943
It's time
to settle the score.

09:03.043 --> 09:08.782
**

09:08.882 --> 09:10.483
Steve, I don't
know about this.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.985
You're breaking into
a pet store,

09:12.085 --> 09:13.921
you've driven
all your friends away,

09:14.021 --> 09:15.455
and don't think
I don't smell

09:15.555 --> 09:17.157
those clove cigarettes
on your breath.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.325
Whatever.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.628
It's a slippery slope,
Steve.

09:20.728 --> 09:21.662
First it's cloves.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.663
Then it's e-cigs.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.931
Then it's regular cigs.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.065
Then it's mary jane.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.099
Then it's cocaine.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.735
Then it's
black tar heroin.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.236
That is the order.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.904
You think I like this?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.573
You think I'm enjoying
doing whatever I want

09:33.674 --> 09:36.844
with total impunity,
basically running the school

09:36.944 --> 09:40.013
and being less a student
and more a god?

09:40.113 --> 09:42.850
Pray to me!

09:42.950 --> 09:44.785
Sorry, I missed all that.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.586
The lunch ladies
and I just about had our

09:46.687 --> 09:49.289
escape room night planned,
and now Gretchen wants to change

09:49.389 --> 09:51.524
everything around
for her son's funeral.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.426
I'm not a bad kid.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.963
I just need to gain
Lewis' trust.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.865
I'll only release
one animal.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.533
No harm, no foul,
no big whoop.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.302
(monkey screeching)

10:02.402 --> 10:03.804
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:03.904 --> 10:04.972
No, no, no, no!

10:05.072 --> 10:06.339
Not the snakes!

10:06.439 --> 10:07.374
No!

10:07.474 --> 10:09.009
Oh!

10:09.109 --> 10:11.011
Not the pretty peacocks!

10:11.111 --> 10:12.445
**

10:12.545 --> 10:14.782
(animals roaring, screeching)

10:15.849 --> 10:17.317
STEVE:
I'm sure they'll come back.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.388
-(peacocks squawking)
-How do these stupid birds

10:21.488 --> 10:23.023
keep getting
in our house?

10:23.123 --> 10:28.195
Oh, ladies, ladies,
this dancing has exhausted me.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.531
Let us step inside
for some refreshments.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.701
Myah! Myah!

10:33.801 --> 10:34.968
That laugh.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.536
It's enchanting!

10:36.636 --> 10:38.305
(squawking)

10:38.405 --> 10:40.974
Hey, it's that wonderful
working-class Brit

10:41.074 --> 10:42.843
who owns the sunglass place
at the mall.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.577
(British accent)
I found yer 'usband

10:44.678 --> 10:45.713
and this grey boy
at the mall.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.215
Why are they
frozen like this?

10:48.315 --> 10:51.051
These geezas saw
sum'ing terrible.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.421
Sum'ing that made them
lose their words.

10:54.521 --> 10:59.760
Sum'ing that even $4,000
of sunglasses couldn't fix.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.594
I charged it
to a credit card

11:01.695 --> 11:05.065
I found stickin' out
of the grey one's ass.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.734
Anyway,
I gotta get back.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.871
I'm expectin' a 'uge
shipment of Oakley's.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.742
-What did he say?
-I think it was a poem.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.944
It was so beautiful.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.678
'Sup with them?

11:18.779 --> 11:21.081
(bell rings)

11:21.181 --> 11:25.085
Today's chicken provencal
was amazing.

11:25.185 --> 11:29.356
Really made up for yesterday's
pitiful trout almondine.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.958
You should smile more.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.060
Steven.
I need to see you.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.294
Now.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.029
I'm worried
about you, Steve.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.731
-I have half a mind
to pull you out.
-You can't --

11:37.831 --> 11:39.299
Don't listen to Steve!

11:39.399 --> 11:41.568
He's been seduced by
the hall monitor lifestyle.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.236
I have not.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.704
Then you won't
have a problem...

11:44.805 --> 11:45.906
wearing a wire.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.375
Ooh, tonight's
bad for a wire.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.077
We have a big dinner
with Lewis.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.145
L-Let's pencil it in
for after Labor Day.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.949
That would give me a chance
to focus on the sex dance.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.150
Steve doesn't want
to catch Lewis

11:57.250 --> 11:58.952
because he's
in too deep.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.553
Right.
Steve wears the wire.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.621
Tonight.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.890
Fine.

12:02.990 --> 12:03.891
I'm coming with.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.559
And if we get in trouble,
I have cyanide pills.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.962
We cannot fall
into enemy hands.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.298
Wait, they look just like
my Tic Tacs.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.300
Why did I mix them together?

12:13.400 --> 12:17.938
Oh, man, I was handing these out
like crazy at the post office.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.340
**

12:20.440 --> 12:21.842
(laughter)

12:21.942 --> 12:24.511
Damn, guys.
Smith cracks me up!

12:24.611 --> 12:26.479
KLAUS: They're on to us.
We got no way out.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.181
Take the pill.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.017
As you know,
I gathered you here

12:30.117 --> 12:32.252
to reveal
my diabolical scheme.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.821
That sounds
like dessert talk.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.422
It all started
when I was wasted

12:35.522 --> 12:36.990
and bought
a Christmas tree farm.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.827
But that thing makes no money
11 months a year!

12:39.927 --> 12:42.529
I had to find a way
to make money year round,

12:42.629 --> 12:46.166
so I cooked up
this totally illegal idea.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.700
Hold that thought,
I gotta take a dump.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.803
Hold that dump,
I gotta share a thought.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.805
I've been grinding up
the trees for sawdust,

12:51.905 --> 12:53.273
but nobody
wanted this stuff.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.176
-(plates clatter)
-So I finally had the excuse

12:56.276 --> 12:58.946
to do something I've wanted
to do for years --

12:59.046 --> 13:00.680
poison children.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.216
Lots of vomit means
lots of sawdust.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.685
I-I don't think any of that
could be tied to you.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.387
But that was
small potatoes.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.456
This next part
is big potatoes.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.690
If someone were
to record it,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.125
there's not
a jury in the world

13:12.225 --> 13:14.727
that wouldn't lock me up
and throw away the key!

13:14.828 --> 13:17.865
I'm going to poison
the town's water supply!

13:17.965 --> 13:21.534
Me!
Principal Brian Lewis!

13:21.634 --> 13:23.170
Oh, boy.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.538
Oh, man.
What a sting.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.707
We got Lewis
dead to rights.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.309
Didn't you think some of
the things he said

13:29.409 --> 13:31.744
had a jokey,
inadmissible quality?

13:31.845 --> 13:34.147
Oh, no.
This is airtight.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.348
Whoo-hoo!

13:35.448 --> 13:36.917
I'm gonna hit the sack.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.089
KLAUS: I can't sleep.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.590
I'm buzzing.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.893
Where are those
cyanide pills?

13:45.993 --> 13:47.227
I'll just take
a little half.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.930
Slow down the old
super-computer.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.398
What are you doing?!

13:51.498 --> 13:52.532
I-I have to do it!

13:52.632 --> 13:54.434
I have to!
I'm in too deep!

13:54.534 --> 13:57.104
Before you do it, just let me
say three words to you --

13:57.204 --> 13:59.206
telescoping driving cane.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.773
That means
nothing to me.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.043
Hi-yaaaa!

14:03.143 --> 14:04.912
(thud)

14:05.012 --> 14:07.080
He's coming to!

14:07.180 --> 14:08.882
STEVE: Wh-What's going on?

14:08.982 --> 14:11.284
These are the women
Lewis fired.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.621
They wander the streets,
still dressed as lunch ladies.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.124
They just want to put
slop on plates.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.926
Won't you help them,
Steve?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.560
I will.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.629
Your whack on the head
knocked some sense into me.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.697
We've got to get this
evidence to Turlington.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.434
I'll drive.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.037
Where does one buy
a telescoping driving cane?

14:30.137 --> 14:31.371
-Eddie Bauer.
-Oh.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.705
(both scream)

14:33.240 --> 14:34.374
(both scream)

14:34.474 --> 14:36.043
(light switch clicks)

14:36.143 --> 14:37.310
Do you think
it was suicide?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.811
At least we have
the recording.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.447
We can still take it
to the cops.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.450
We should
close his eyes.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.784
Oh, shit.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.120
This freak doesn't have
any eyelids.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.155
(telephone ringing)

14:48.255 --> 14:49.622
Gather round.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.458
All you cops are gonna want
to hear this.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.493
Yeah, so put down your
doughnuts, piggies,

14:53.593 --> 14:54.661
and listen up!

14:58.131 --> 15:00.600
KLAUS: (groaning)

15:00.700 --> 15:02.302
It's so dang hot under this.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.803
I'm dying.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.806
Why did I guzzle
that Arizona Iced Tea?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.441
(click, rewinding)

15:08.541 --> 15:11.945
Steve's wearing a jacket
and a long-sleeve tee?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.646
What is wrong with him?

15:13.746 --> 15:16.616
(sighs) Well,
we have nothing.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.085
Wait,
don't turn it off.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.487
I'm about to sing a song
from Wicked.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.455
KLAUS: The wizard
is ready for you.

15:22.555 --> 15:26.026
(vocalizing)

15:28.828 --> 15:30.863
**

15:30.964 --> 15:31.864
Turlington's dead,

15:31.965 --> 15:33.700
the whole town's about
to get poisoned --

15:33.800 --> 15:35.002
(cellphone chimes)

15:35.102 --> 15:38.005
And now Lewis wants
to take me up to the tree farm.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.706
Oh, God!
He's gonna kill me!

15:39.806 --> 15:42.009
No. He's gonna kill us.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.510
You're not coming.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.546
It's sweet of you to worry
about me, but I'm coming.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.181
Fine.
But to be clear,

15:48.281 --> 15:49.849
I wasn't trying
to keep you safe.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.818
I just didn't want
to be around you.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.686
Your little bowl
bothers me.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.488
All the scooting
and scraping.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.824
It's...very unpleasant.

15:57.924 --> 16:01.828
**

16:01.928 --> 16:03.663
I thought it was
about time you all saw

16:03.763 --> 16:04.864
where
the magic happens.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.399
I call it magic
because I don't know

16:06.499 --> 16:08.535
what any
of these machines do.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.339
I have a bunch of fat guys who
make the machines eat the trees.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.007
They're so fat.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.408
You should see
their work pants.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.510
The size!
When they hang them up to dry,

16:17.610 --> 16:19.646
they look like
medieval tapestries!

16:19.746 --> 16:22.082
Some of them
are truly gorgeous.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.885
I'm gonna sneak off
and do some recon.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.887
Klaus,
it's super-dangerous.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.888
Don't worry.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.524
Ol' Klaus can
take care of himself.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.393
* Bum-bum-bum-bum
bum-bum-bum-bum *

16:33.493 --> 16:34.427
Shh!

16:34.527 --> 16:37.197
* Bwaaaaa bwaaa! *

16:37.297 --> 16:40.200
* Bwaaaa, bwah-bwah! *

16:40.300 --> 16:41.934
KLAUS: Oop! I've been
caught immediately!

16:42.035 --> 16:43.270
No!
Not the toilet!

16:43.370 --> 16:45.238
(toilet flushes)

16:45.338 --> 16:49.609
**

16:49.709 --> 16:51.111
This isn't
funny anymore.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.846
We gotta do something
about these Catatonic Cathys.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.448
It's been days.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.850
Okay, that was
a little funny.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.352
-(knock on door)
-Don't worry, Mom.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.420
I called in some help.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.755
FRANCINE: Dr. Ray?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.691
I-I thought you died.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.393
-No.
-Oh, okay.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.461
Let's see
what we've got here.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.629
Mm-hmm.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.364
With extreme cases
like this,

17:11.464 --> 17:14.901
I find that returning to
the scene of the initial event

17:15.001 --> 17:18.271
sometimes helps snap
the patient out of it.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.940
How long could
this take?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.809
I don't know.
I gave up 30 minutes ago.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.711
Ooh!
A Cinnabon!

17:24.811 --> 17:26.879
I have one last idea.

17:28.948 --> 17:33.553
(rock music plays)

17:33.653 --> 17:35.655
* Come, my lady,
come, come, my lady *

17:35.755 --> 17:37.090
* You're my butterfly,
sugar, baby *

17:37.190 --> 17:40.059
* Come, my lady,
come, come, my lady *

17:40.160 --> 17:42.262
* You're my butterfly,
sugar, baby *

17:42.362 --> 17:44.397
* Such a sexy, sexy,
pretty little thing *

17:44.497 --> 17:45.398
* Fierce nipple pierce *

17:45.698 --> 17:47.300
* You got me sprung
with your tongue ring *

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
* And I ain't gonna lie 'cause
your living gets me high *

17:49.502 --> 17:50.770
* So to keep you by my side *

17:50.870 --> 17:52.339
* There's nothing
that I won't try *

17:52.439 --> 17:54.474
* Butterflies in her eyes
and looks to kill *

17:54.574 --> 17:56.776
* Time is passing I'm asking
"Could this be real?" *

17:56.876 --> 17:58.611
* 'Cause I can't sleep,
I can't hold still *

17:58.711 --> 18:00.847
* The only thing I really know
is she got sex appeal *

18:00.947 --> 18:02.982
* I can feel,
too much is never enough *

18:03.082 --> 18:05.185
Well, I'm out
of ideas.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.786
Give it up, you guys!

18:06.886 --> 18:08.788
They're gonna be
vegetables forever!

18:08.888 --> 18:11.424
(screams)

18:11.524 --> 18:13.960
(screaming continues)

18:16.963 --> 18:18.331
Oh, hey, fun.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.200
The whole family's mall walking.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.170
What do you think?
Could old Al use a few laps?

18:23.270 --> 18:24.604
(chuckles)

18:24.704 --> 18:26.673
Do you even hear yourself?
"Oh, hey, fun.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.007
The whole family's mall walking.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.876
Yeah."
Oh, you're the town fool.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.978
Just get of here
with your dignity.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.980
Smell ya on the flip side,
skater bois.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.349
What the hell was that?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.351
**

18:38.451 --> 18:40.220
Huh? Huh?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.522
Ha. Those are funny.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.191
They're not supposed
to be funny.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.992
I think they're
incredibly moving.

18:46.092 --> 18:50.163
And now for the main event --
making the whole town puke.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.632
With this gross stuff
I found in my trunk.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.667
-(hissing)
-ALL: Ugh!

18:54.767 --> 18:58.838
This pipe leads directly
to the town's water supply.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.040
-(gasping)
-You think that's bad?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.875
Get ready to gasp again.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.144
There's a mole among our ranks.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.145
(gasping)

19:06.246 --> 19:07.380
(gasps)

19:07.480 --> 19:09.382
This is Turlington's phone,

19:09.482 --> 19:13.886
and this is the contact labeled
"hall monitor spy."

19:13.986 --> 19:16.856
(cellphone beeps, ringing)

19:16.956 --> 19:18.691
We could have made
a great team, Smith.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.194
But instead, you chose to be
murdered by your classmates.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.362
Get him!

19:24.431 --> 19:26.266
STEVE: You almost thought
of everything, Lewis.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.536
But there's one thing you forgot
to have thought of --

19:29.636 --> 19:33.340
in juvie,
I only worked out my legs!

19:33.440 --> 19:34.374
(grunts)

19:34.474 --> 19:38.077
(triumphant music plays)

19:38.177 --> 19:39.078
Ooh!

19:39.178 --> 19:40.179
(thud)

19:40.280 --> 19:42.682
(gasping)

19:42.782 --> 19:44.717
Lewis, you've poisoned
your last person...

19:44.817 --> 19:46.953
(stomach grumbling)

19:47.053 --> 19:48.087
...me.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.222
(door slams open)

19:49.322 --> 19:51.391
Hold it right there!

19:51.491 --> 19:53.593
Hey! I thought
we flushed you!

19:53.693 --> 19:57.464
When you flush,
you've gotta check the bowl.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.899
Lunch ladies, attack!

19:59.999 --> 20:00.967
**

20:01.067 --> 20:03.202
-(grunts)
-Oh!

20:04.136 --> 20:05.071
(grunts)

20:05.171 --> 20:06.739
**

20:06.839 --> 20:08.241
(thudding, pots clanging)

20:08.341 --> 20:10.243
Ooh! (groans)

20:10.343 --> 20:12.379
(retches)

20:12.479 --> 20:14.281
**

20:14.381 --> 20:15.982
Aah!

20:16.082 --> 20:18.385
(grunts) Aaah!

20:19.986 --> 20:22.489
Aaah!

20:22.589 --> 20:24.090
(thudding, crashing)

20:26.726 --> 20:28.761
Wh-Wh-What happened?

20:28.861 --> 20:30.096
Easy, bud.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.499
You're home safe
in the school cafeteria.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.267
Wh-What's going
in my arm?

20:34.367 --> 20:36.002
You lost a lot of fluids,

20:36.102 --> 20:38.638
so Agnes put you
on a Salisbury IV.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.774
Look, the brown's returning
to your cheeks already.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.445
Thanks for saving me
from Lewis, and from myself.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.146
Hey, what happened
to Lewis?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.748
He got away basically.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.083
Lewis gets away again!

20:51.183 --> 20:53.252
Hey, you wanna buy
a mattress factory?

20:53.353 --> 20:56.188
(bleep) yeah, I do!

20:56.289 --> 20:57.824
(gasps)

20:57.924 --> 20:58.825
Billy?

20:58.925 --> 21:02.128
I had
the premonition again.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.130
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!

21:06.198 --> 21:08.000
