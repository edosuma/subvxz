00:16.930 --> 00:18.470
Please help me.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.440
I can't feel my legs! Please?

00:22.910 --> 00:24.910
I'm gonna die!

00:25.280 --> 00:27.410
It's,um...

00:27.740 --> 00:30.360
it's been 7 minutes.

00:30.370 --> 00:32.549
I'm done with this,ok?

00:33.440 --> 00:35.570
Is it worse than you thought?

00:35.580 --> 00:37.820
I--I can't
breathe.

00:38.770 --> 00:39.630
What are you doing?

00:39.640 --> 00:42.450
Just--just let
me out,please.

00:43.550 --> 00:45.530
Just let me out.

00:46.420 --> 00:47.830
Yes,it's worse!

00:47.840 --> 00:49.090
No,please!

00:53.080 --> 00:55.650
Let me out!Let me out!

00:59.700 --> 01:02.420
Let me out!Please!

01:05.019 --> 01:06.200
Please!

02:18.690 --> 02:21.900
He left everything,except
the photographs.

02:21.910 --> 02:24.660
He always said those
were like his family.

02:25.150 --> 02:28.310
What should we do with all of this?

02:38.220 --> 02:39.660
Come in.

02:41.530 --> 02:43.420
How is everyone?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.000
We're adapting.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.680
His resignation is official.

02:47.690 --> 02:51.210
Jason gideon is no longer
an agent inurhe b teau.

02:52.350 --> 02:54.420
Is he going to guest lecture?

02:54.430 --> 02:57.010
No. He's gone.

02:57.020 --> 03:00.080
His years of service are appreciated.

03:00.290 --> 03:02.580
We're looking for his replacement.

03:02.590 --> 03:03.370
That was fast.

03:03.380 --> 03:05.580
Well,the bureau doesn't like
to leave posts empty for long.

03:05.590 --> 03:06.680
I'd like your input.

03:06.690 --> 03:08.840
I appreciate that.

03:09.070 --> 03:09.990
Sir,we're gathering.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.330
Thank you.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.320
Is everything ok?

03:15.660 --> 03:18.100
Ok,we have 4 victims in oregon.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.770
2 male,2 female.

03:19.780 --> 03:21.100
I got this.

03:21.110 --> 03:22.750
Uh,sure.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.430
I know that we've all been
wondering what this was all about.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.070
And,uh...

03:30.080 --> 03:35.800
you know I've know Jason for many
years,and I can tell you I have no idea.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.900
But it doesn't even matter.

03:37.910 --> 03:42.340
What matters is we're
here,and we're gonna continue.

03:43.100 --> 03:47.030
Portland field office uncovered a mass
grave with 3 bodies,killed 6 months ago.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.410
Nearby they found another body.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.580
Causes of death range from
burning alive to asphyxiation.

03:53.590 --> 03:55.460
No sexual assault.

03:55.470 --> 03:57.400
Well,the torture's clearly sadistic.

03:57.410 --> 04:02.180
The lack of sexual preferences could make it
hard to tell if the unsub is male or female.

04:02.190 --> 04:04.640
Typically,female serial
killers stick to the same M.O.

04:04.650 --> 04:06.640
It looks like this
guy's all over the place.

04:06.650 --> 04:08.540
Most recent victim is jenny wittman.

04:08.550 --> 04:10.450
Asphyxiated. Discovered yesterday.

04:10.460 --> 04:11.600
Reid: How long was she missing?

04:11.610 --> 04:14.030
She was never reported missing.

04:14.830 --> 04:15.830
What about the others?

04:15.840 --> 04:16.560
Only one.

04:16.570 --> 04:17.810
One of 4?

04:17.820 --> 04:22.100
Rick holland was reported missing 9
months ago,but the search was called off.

04:22.110 --> 04:24.130
Hotch: Family discovered
his car at the train station.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.780
But more importantly,they received
e-mails from him saying that

04:27.790 --> 04:29.710
he needed time to figure things out.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.280
And his family bought that?

04:31.300 --> 04:33.490
Well,I guess the alternative
was too hard to accept.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.380
Reaching out could be a sign of remorse.

04:36.390 --> 04:38.220
Psychopaths don't apologize
for their behavior.

04:38.230 --> 04:39.740
This guy's covering his tracks.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.150
Well,it's working.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.340
So...

04:42.350 --> 04:47.740
3 victims he buried in one grave and
then only jenny wittman in the other.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.630
You thinking it's a pattern?

04:49.640 --> 04:51.430
Uh,it's hard to tell.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.280
If there is,it's one down...

04:53.290 --> 04:55.270
2 to go.

Scared to Death

05:30.970 --> 05:33.910
The taoist philosopher
lao tzu once wrote:

05:33.920 --> 05:36.740
He who controls others may be powerful,

05:36.750 --> 05:40.780
but he who has mastered
himself is mightier still.

05:41.530 --> 05:43.700
Can we go over what portland found?

05:43.900 --> 05:48.930
One female and 2 male victims found
buried together in the same grave.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.430
All 25 to 30.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.190
All had been dead... 6 months?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.950
That sounds like 3 different M.O.S.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.480
Uh,gary taylor,the phantom sniper,was
all over the map,just like this guy.

05:59.490 --> 06:02.850
He changed his M.O. As his need
to control the situation changed.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.560
What about the fresh grave?

06:04.570 --> 06:07.700
Uh,female,28,dead roughly 48 hours.

06:07.710 --> 06:09.390
She was asphyxiated.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.840
It's a good thing this guy's
dump site has been compromised.

06:11.850 --> 06:15.530
As soon as the unsub knows that,he
may feel pressured that we're onto him.

06:15.540 --> 06:18.290
It could push him to make a mistake.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.930
Hey. You.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.140
Uh,down here.

06:23.630 --> 06:25.190
I knew that.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.200
Good thing you're handsome,doctor.

06:27.210 --> 06:28.510
Attention
team members--

06:28.520 --> 06:34.360
this killer guy continues to stoop to an
all-time low of lows by posing as his victims.

06:34.370 --> 06:38.010
He's also manipulated 2 of the families
into thinking that everything was ok,

06:38.020 --> 06:40.260
even after they were reported missing.

06:40.270 --> 06:42.250
One of the fake e-mails
was from their daughter.

06:42.260 --> 06:46.490
She said she met this guy and was taking him to
her favorite place,australia,for a couple of weeks.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.920
Family contacted the australian
authorities after too much time had passed.

06:49.930 --> 06:52.480
This guy sure knows a lot of personal
informat nio about his victims.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.660
How did he get access
to their e-mail accounts?

06:54.670 --> 06:56.710
Screen name was the same,but
the domain was different.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.060
The families never noticed.

06:58.070 --> 07:00.030
When I find more pieces
of the puzzle,you'll know.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.350
Garcia out.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.550
This guy's creative.

07:04.010 --> 07:07.660
Let's go over the details one more time just
to make sure we haven't missing anything.

07:09.950 --> 07:12.420
F.B.I.Field Office PORTLAND OREGON

07:12.430 --> 07:14.730
You must be the B.A.U.Special
agent bill calvert.

07:14.740 --> 07:16.010
Hi. Jennifer jareau.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.500
This is ssa aaron hotchner.

07:17.510 --> 07:20.340
These are agents
morgan,prentiss,and dr.Reid.

07:20.350 --> 07:21.870
I appreciate your help on this case.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.030
So you're from boston,huh?

07:23.040 --> 07:25.290
The accent's kind of hard
to miss in oregon,right?

07:25.300 --> 07:27.370
We'd like to take a look around
jenny wittman's apartment.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.260
I'd take you myself,but I'm
waiting to meet a family,

07:29.270 --> 07:30.440
so I'll have another
agent drive you out there.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.270
Thank you.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.930
- I'll stay behind and work victimology.
- Great.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.180
I could use some extra hands.

07:34.190 --> 07:35.800
We'll call you if we find anything.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.610
So we'll just set up here?

07:37.620 --> 07:39.760
Yeah. Yeah,this is fine.Right here.

07:41.910 --> 07:44.630
Wittman's place is on the fourth floor.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.870
***

07:51.880 --> 07:54.570
I'll... meet you guys up there.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.730
Don't do that.

08:09.740 --> 08:10.760
Why isn't it moving?

08:10.770 --> 08:12.030
I don't know.

08:12.040 --> 08:12.900
Don't--stop
it!

08:12.910 --> 08:14.480
- Don't...
- what?What's the problem?

08:14.490 --> 08:15.540
Don't do that!

08:15.550 --> 08:16.100
Why not?

08:16.110 --> 08:18.010
Because there are 6 elevator
related deaths per year,

08:18.020 --> 08:20.680
not to mention 10,000 injuries
that require hospitalization.

08:20.690 --> 08:21.330
Chill out.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.490
That sounds like pretty good odds to me.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.410
- Are you scared,reid?
- I'm not scared.

08:24.420 --> 08:28.380
- I do tn'want to be in an elevator with you,to
be honest. - How about I push that?What if I push--

08:30.500 --> 08:32.429
Whoa.Ok.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.610
hit the--hit
the-- yeah.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.190
Push it!

08:40.200 --> 08:41.850
push,pull,push,pull. I'm doing it.

08:41.860 --> 08:42.960
Nothing's happening.

08:42.970 --> 08:44.650
Pry--pry-- pry
the door open.

08:44.660 --> 08:47.010
Just--
yeah.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.100
It's stuck,man.

08:51.710 --> 08:52.920
No,no,no,no. Not today.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.140
No,not today.

08:54.150 --> 08:55.930
Hotch?

08:55.940 --> 08:57.350
Hotch!

09:00.900 --> 09:02.520
Hallelujah.

09:03.330 --> 09:05.390
Was that the alarm? You guys ok?

09:05.400 --> 09:07.650
I'll get back to you on that.

09:19.110 --> 09:21.470
Fbi was already here 2 days ago.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.670
Didn't find anything.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.460
We're from the behavioral analysis unit.

09:25.470 --> 09:26.340
What's that mean?

09:26.350 --> 09:28.430
It means that we study human behavior.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.400
We don't just look at evidence.

09:30.410 --> 09:34.460
It helps us to determine why this
killer chose this particular victim.

09:35.550 --> 09:38.560
The place has a lived-in feel to it.

09:38.570 --> 09:41.060
It looks like she spent
most of her free time here.

09:41.070 --> 09:43.320
No messages on the answering machine.

09:43.330 --> 09:45.310
Hey,guys.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.650
Come take a look at this.

09:50.500 --> 09:54.110
There's bath products all around the
tub,but she never turned the shower on.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.090
What makes you say that?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.000
It's got nothing but boxes inside.

09:59.010 --> 10:00.940
She used it for storage.

10:00.950 --> 10:04.340
Uh,did anything ever strike
you as odd about jenny?

10:04.350 --> 10:05.420
You know what?

10:05.430 --> 10:08.050
When she moved in here 2 months ago,

10:08.060 --> 10:10.450
she walked up and down
those stairs a hundred times.

10:10.870 --> 10:12.680
She wouldn't use the elevator.

10:12.690 --> 10:14.630
I don't blame her.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.290
Ok,so we know jenny didn't like
tight spaces or the elevator.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.070
What else do we know?

10:23.080 --> 10:27.660
We know that he preys on people that are
new to the city with no strong social ties.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.730
And jenny fits the model.
She's an easy target.

10:29.740 --> 10:32.190
And he's betting that
she won't be missed.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.710
We have been over the details
of this case so many times,

10:35.720 --> 10:37.930
I could recite it in my sleep.

10:37.940 --> 10:39.670
Nothing like being prepared.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.770
Sorry to interrupt,but I just
spoke to jenny wittman's family.

10:43.230 --> 10:44.720
Did they give you any insights?

10:44.730 --> 10:47.060
Well,they weren't what
you'd call close-knit.

10:47.070 --> 10:48.450
It was like she wanted a fresh start.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.880
Struck out on her own.

10:49.890 --> 10:52.610
Yeah,garcia couldn't come up with
any connection between the victims.

10:52.620 --> 10:56.090
Different socioeconomic backgrounds,levels
of education,and areas of work.

10:56.100 --> 10:59.740
But they all had relocated to portland
without any family or friends--

10:59.750 --> 11:01.420
one divorced,the rest single.

11:01.430 --> 11:02.610
They did have that in common.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.910
New to the city,and
they all lived alone.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.490
That'd describe me to a T.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.260
I transferred to this
field office a month ago.

11:08.270 --> 11:11.470
I'm 30,single,and don't have much of
a social life since I work so much.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.800
Well,I need to go over whatever evidence
you found at the other victims' homes,

11:14.810 --> 11:17.690
and then I would love to pick your brain
about how you got settled into the city.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.820
Absolutely.

11:19.830 --> 11:21.320
So this guy...

11:21.330 --> 11:24.680
he burns 'em,hangs 'em,smothers 'em.

11:24.690 --> 11:26.950
Why does he kill so many different ways?

11:27.280 --> 11:30.320
That's exactly what
we're trying to find out.

11:42.390 --> 11:44.870
Mommy,please,don't turn off the light!

11:44.880 --> 11:46.250
Stop whining!

11:46.260 --> 11:47.480
But I'm scared!

11:47.490 --> 11:50.570
On pmoree eep out of
you and I'm going to...

11:50.580 --> 11:52.940
mommy,please don't get the belt!

11:52.950 --> 11:53.760
No!

11:53.770 --> 11:55.630
No,mommy,please!

11:55.640 --> 11:57.330
No!

11:57.340 --> 11:59.090
Please!

12:13.150 --> 12:14.230
Patrick.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.440
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

12:16.450 --> 12:18.460
I didn't know that kelly
had gone home for the day.

12:18.470 --> 12:19.330
It's no problem.

12:19.340 --> 12:20.840
I got plenty to keep me busy.

12:20.850 --> 12:22.140
Thanks for coming in so late.

12:22.150 --> 12:23.860
Does this time work
better for your schedule?

12:23.870 --> 12:25.910
Yeah. After class is great.

12:28.950 --> 12:31.080
This is our fourth session.

12:31.090 --> 12:34.040
Tell me about the progress
you think we've made.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.050
Well,I thought about what you said.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.520
I want to move on to the next phase.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.890
I recognize these
names from your website.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.700
How many specialists work
with the goodman institute?

12:53.560 --> 12:55.690
We're looking for another
who can make house calls.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.580
For agoraphobics?

12:57.590 --> 13:01.640
Some patients know what's best,but they can't
find the courage to go through behavioral therapy.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.890
I figured it's what I
had to do to get over it.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.960
I have nothing to fear but fear itself.

13:05.970 --> 13:07.430
That's what they say.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.670
So what was the first thing
you did when you moved here?

13:09.680 --> 13:13.470
I found the best coffee in town,then
moved within walking distance.

13:13.480 --> 13:17.310
Ok,so you got established got
comfortable in your surroundings...

13:17.320 --> 13:18.670
- joined a gym.
- All right.Ok.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.790
So where else
is there--

13:20.800 --> 13:23.470
doctor,dentist,dry cleaner.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.360
You think he goes to these
places to find his victims?

13:26.370 --> 13:27.850
Maybe.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.560
There's something around every corner.

13:30.570 --> 13:33.480
Well,we only have to
canvass 4 neighborhoods.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.670
I had to stop going to camp after that.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.130
And you never learned to swim?

13:39.140 --> 13:39.770
No,I couldn'T.

13:39.780 --> 13:41.720
I had a panic attack every
time I got near the water.

13:41.730 --> 13:43.810
Well,look at you now.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.860
You're doing just fine,patrick.

13:46.870 --> 13:48.560
I guess so.

13:48.570 --> 13:51.790
Our bodies knew water
before they knew air.

13:51.800 --> 13:55.140
It's really the most
natural thing in the world.

13:55.150 --> 13:57.000
It's not going to hurt you.

13:59.260 --> 14:01.710
I've never been this
close and felt so calm.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.010
That's because you've
admitted you need help.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.800
That's the hardest part.

14:05.810 --> 14:09.570
All we gotta do now is
get ahold of this fear.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.460
I thought we'd be in a
laboratory or something.I just--

14:12.470 --> 14:15.250
behavioral therapy's most
effective in a natural setting.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.830
You get a feeling for
what it's really like.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.080
How you doing?

14:20.090 --> 14:21.360
I'm kind of sweaty.

14:21.370 --> 14:23.680
That's perfectly normal.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.480
Do you need a second?

14:28.390 --> 14:29.430
No.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.370
No,let's do it.

14:40.070 --> 14:44.600
ok,we know this guy used wildwood trail
as h pisersonal graveyard for 6 months.

14:44.610 --> 14:46.810
That site's been blown for him now,

14:46.820 --> 14:49.480
which means that he's been
forced to change part of his M.O.

14:49.770 --> 14:53.320
Which won't be easy for somebody
who thrives on being in control.

14:53.330 --> 14:56.200
The reason that he's gotten away
with these first 3 murders is that

14:56.210 --> 15:01.600
he's been meticulous at every stage,from how he
chooses his victims to their torture and their burial.

15:01.610 --> 15:04.520
To us,his victims
appear to be nonspecific.

15:04.530 --> 15:08.800
Other than being new to portland,all they
seem to have shared was a torturous death.

15:08.810 --> 15:11.850
But you think the unsub chooses
them for another reason,too?

15:11.860 --> 15:13.150
We think so.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.670
The tortures lack a sexual
component,which is incredibly rare.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.800
I think it's more about,uh,not
necessarily about exerting power,

15:19.810 --> 15:23.060
but more like overcompensating
for a lack of it.

15:23.070 --> 15:26.080
This guy craves control.

15:26.090 --> 15:29.290
He's coming from a place of
weakness,trying to demonstrate strength.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.690
Now we see this a lot in
unsubs who've have been abused.

15:31.700 --> 15:35.040
The lack of sexual assault could be as
simple as the fact that he's impotent,

15:35.050 --> 15:36.870
something that he's trying to hide.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.040
A man this obsessed with control most
likely feels powerless in his everyday life.

15:41.050 --> 15:43.430
So he would crave stability,security.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.910
He's most likely married.

15:44.920 --> 15:48.980
If he is impotent,he could keep up
appearances by adopting children.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.640
Yeah,and someone this methodical
has every moment planned.

15:51.650 --> 15:56.910
If he is captured,he'd most likely take his own
life rather than give up any sort of control.

15:56.920 --> 16:01.610
Morgan: The victims' lack of defensive wounds
suggest that they willingly put themselves in danger.

16:01.620 --> 16:06.840
So someone of authority or otherwise
easily trusted put them up to this.

16:06.860 --> 16:10.500
Also,the victims' families were led
to believe their loved ones were alive

16:10.510 --> 16:14.180
and well through e-mails
written by this murderer.

16:14.190 --> 16:17.640
He's calculating,and
he's intelligent,and...

16:17.650 --> 16:20.950
we're going to have to do
something that he's not expecting.

16:20.960 --> 16:21.970
Like what?

16:21.980 --> 16:24.680
Like warn his potential victims.

16:24.970 --> 16:25.960
You're doing great.

16:25.970 --> 16:27.770
Just keep telling me that.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.380
Ok. This is good.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.310
How's it feel?

16:35.770 --> 16:37.450
Deep breaths.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.350
No,I'm done. I'm done.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.060
This isn't going to work.

16:42.130 --> 16:44.120
T is iworse than you thought?

16:44.130 --> 16:46.160
I'm not ready. No!

16:46.170 --> 16:47.660
Help
me-- aah!

16:50.110 --> 16:50.980
Help!

16:55.430 --> 16:57.580
Is it worse than you thought?

17:34.160 --> 17:37.160
We found the remains of 4
victims in wildwood trail.

17:37.170 --> 17:40.950
2 women,2 men,all in their
20s,all transplants to portland.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.440
Because the victims have this
in common,we are confident that

17:43.450 --> 17:47.660
the person We're looking for
latches on to people new to the city.

17:47.670 --> 17:50.890
He chooses them because
they make for easier targets.

17:50.900 --> 17:54.540
If you are young and new to
portland,or if you know someone that is,

17:54.550 --> 17:58.210
please call the number on your
screen for more detailed information

17:58.220 --> 18:01.360
about how to stay out
of a dangerous situation.

18:01.370 --> 18:05.010
We believe the person that we're looking
for is able to fit into many surroundings--

18:05.020 --> 18:07.190
oh,this poor dog has
been like this all day.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.480
Lucy,it's ok. It's ok.

18:10.490 --> 18:14.980
Ma'am,you're saying your tenant patrick
walker,28,moved to portland for grad school,

18:14.990 --> 18:16.530
and he's been missing for how long?

18:16.540 --> 18:17.850
Since this morning.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.660
I know that that sounds crazy,but
patrick sticks to a routine.

18:20.670 --> 18:23.640
I tease him that he's
more predictable than I am.

18:23.650 --> 18:28.480
Jogs while I'm watching the morning shows,walks
to class with his backpack after that.

18:28.490 --> 18:30.260
He--he's always
home for lunch.

18:30.270 --> 18:32.190
That's when he walks lucy.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.820
You're in his apartment right now.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.870
Does anything look out of the ordinary?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.920
is his backpack there still?

18:39.340 --> 18:39.880
Yes.

18:39.890 --> 18:42.380
Ok. Then we know he's not at class.

18:42.390 --> 18:45.000
Why would he just leave like this?

18:45.010 --> 18:46.990
I don't know.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.630
What is the point of having
family dinners if you're not here?

19:20.640 --> 19:21.840
I was with a pIentat

19:21.850 --> 19:23.230
at some point,you knew you'd be late.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.510
You should have called.
It's not that hard.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.200
You didn't pay jessica's tuition.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.590
I wrote them a check.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.490
She's taken a bath.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.670
She's brushed her
teeth. I read her books.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.510
She asked for you 3 times already.

19:37.370 --> 19:39.140
Your dinner is going to get cold again.

19:39.150 --> 19:40.310
- Damn it.
- Don't curse at me.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.190
I can't do anything right,huh?

19:42.200 --> 19:43.520
What do you want me to do?

19:43.530 --> 19:45.260
Eat?

19:45.820 --> 19:47.800
Is this it? Is that what you want?

19:48.390 --> 19:49.620
Dos thiesmake you happy?

19:49.630 --> 19:51.070
Is this what you like? Huh?

19:51.080 --> 19:52.960
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

19:52.970 --> 19:55.050
Isn't that what you want?

19:55.060 --> 19:57.240
What's wrong with you?

20:01.380 --> 20:03.880
Why were you yelling at mommy?

20:04.340 --> 20:06.410
It's late,jessica.

20:06.420 --> 20:09.800
Is it because she always yells at you?

20:11.250 --> 20:14.740
That tricks your body into
thinking it's still daytime.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.850
Your melatonin
production is interrupted.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.490
Melo what?

20:19.500 --> 20:21.740
You grow in your sleep,

20:21.750 --> 20:25.530
and n u cayoonly do that...if it's dark.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.140
I don't like the dark.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.190
There's nothing to be afraid of.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.390
It's for your own good.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.580
Don't,daddy.

20:33.590 --> 20:36.510
Don't turn off the light. Please.

20:51.330 --> 20:52.710
Good night.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.630
Local police I.D.'D the body.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.530
It's patrick walker.

21:18.540 --> 21:21.830
He's got deep abrasions and
bruising on the neck and shoulders.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.490
- I'm going to go see if they found anything else in the water.
- Ok.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.380
I know his landlady called
you about this guy missing,

21:28.390 --> 21:30.370
but what makes you
think this is related?

21:30.380 --> 21:32.090
He fits the profile of our victims.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.430
He's the same age,lives
alone,new to the city.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.260
But he wasn't buried
like everybody else.

21:36.270 --> 21:38.450
No,you found the unsub's dump site.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.620
He couldn't go back to the trail.

21:39.630 --> 21:41.520
It forced him to do something different.

21:42.810 --> 21:45.440
Well,they found a rope at the bottom of the
river, but that's probably been there for years.

21:45.450 --> 21:47.450
A couple feet out,they found this.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.040
It's shepherd's crook.

21:49.050 --> 21:51.380
Lifeguards and rescue workers use it.

21:51.390 --> 21:53.930
Oh,I bet he didn't use it for safety.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.340
Officer,thank you.

21:56.350 --> 21:59.210
We haven't seen any evidence of
a struggle with the other bodies.

21:59.220 --> 22:00.630
This is the first one.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.370
Do you remember any open cases
involving suspicious drownings?

22:04.380 --> 22:06.760
Since I've been in
portland,we've had 2 or 3.

22:06.770 --> 22:08.630
I can call the office,get the
files to your other agents.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.300
Maybe they can make a connection.

22:10.310 --> 22:12.050
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.210
Hotchner.

22:16.220 --> 22:20.000
Hey,that landlady prentiss
spoke to was right to be worried.

22:20.310 --> 22:22.280
We just found patrick
walker dead in a river.

22:22.290 --> 22:24.120
And it was exactly what you predicted.

22:24.130 --> 22:26.490
He found a new place to dump the body.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.830
Fire,hanging,asphyxiation.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.380
Now we've got a drowning.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.490
I think it's someone
who's afraid of drowning.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.920
What do you mean?

22:33.930 --> 22:37.300
Yeah,it hit me when morgan freaked
out when we were stuck in the elevator.

22:37.310 --> 22:38.700
You got stuck in an elevator?

22:38.710 --> 22:39.680
I freaked?

22:39.690 --> 22:41.120
Well,that's not
important. Here's what is.

22:41.130 --> 22:43.630
If you look at the M.O.S of the
victims,what do they all have in common?

22:43.640 --> 22:45.900
They could all be classified
as anxiety disorders.

22:45.910 --> 22:47.830
It's right out of the diagnostics
and statistical manual.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.680
It lists 5 subtypes of phobias.

22:49.690 --> 22:51.520
Most of these are
environmental and situational.

22:51.530 --> 22:52.900
Exactly.

22:52.910 --> 22:55.100
So it's all about fear.

22:55.110 --> 22:57.980
These people are being
killed by their fears.

22:59.560 --> 23:00.520
Please help me.

23:00.530 --> 23:01.860
Help me.

23:10.270 --> 23:12.790
So hotch is even more intense
now that gideon's gone.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.790
Yeah,I've noticed.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.810
Do you think that's going to change?

23:15.820 --> 23:17.420
I certainly think we'll find out.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.760
What about you?

23:18.770 --> 23:21.270
- You ok? -
Oh,I'm--I'm great.

23:22.730 --> 23:24.560
Do you want to talk about it?

23:24.570 --> 23:27.130
What's there to talk about,really?

23:27.460 --> 23:28.700
Gideon.

23:28.710 --> 23:30.380
Oh,no.He,uh--

23:30.390 --> 23:32.620
he left a letter explaining everything.

23:32.630 --> 23:35.710
Just like my dad did when
he abandoned me and my mom.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.810
He addressed it to you.

23:37.820 --> 23:38.470
Yeah,yeah.

23:38.480 --> 23:44.460
You know,gideon stood toe to toe with
some of the sickest people on this planet.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.280
I think that took a
lot of courage,right?

23:47.290 --> 23:48.580
Yeah.

23:48.590 --> 23:51.230
So,why'd he do this?

23:53.320 --> 23:54.970
It's addressed to
me,but I'm--I'm not--

23:54.980 --> 23:56.280
I'm not the only one that he abandoned.

23:56.290 --> 23:58.530
But why is it addressed to you?

23:59.750 --> 24:01.770
I think you need to
read that letter again.

24:01.780 --> 24:03.330
I have an eidetic memory,emily.

24:03.340 --> 24:05.860
Ah,yeah,I know,and an I.Q.Of 187,

24:05.870 --> 24:08.700
but what do you remember
about your father?

24:09.010 --> 24:10.110
What do you mean?

24:10.120 --> 24:13.940
Well,he gave you 10 years before he left,and
yet you've erased all those memories.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.910
And--it's
too painful.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.790
I get it. But then gideon leaves.

24:19.230 --> 24:22.150
I think you need to read that
letter again,and ask yourself why,

24:22.160 --> 24:24.960
of all the people he walked away from,

24:24.970 --> 24:28.040
did he only explain
himself to one person.

24:29.290 --> 24:30.690
You.

24:40.620 --> 24:42.760
How are you adjusting to the city?

24:42.770 --> 24:45.050
Did I actually move to portland?

24:45.060 --> 24:49.370
I wouldn't know it since I've only
seen the 4 walls in my apartment.

24:49.380 --> 24:51.450
I also work at home.

24:51.460 --> 24:53.190
Blessing and a curse.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.830
Must be hard.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.560
I haven't even had time
to hook up my cable.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.180
Morgan said this is the laundromat closest
to patrick walker's apartment building.

25:03.190 --> 25:07.840
So,we have washers and dryers,and...

25:07.850 --> 25:08.920
we have a bulletin board.

25:08.930 --> 25:09.710
Snack machine.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.380
Yeah,I don't think he's
luring them with pretzels.

25:12.850 --> 25:15.240
Babysitter,buy a car...

25:15.250 --> 25:16.940
ooh,look at this baby.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.990
Participate in a
controlled research project

25:19.000 --> 25:22.570
and you'll receive 100 bucks
to get over your anxieties.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.330
You only have to attend 2 sessions?

25:24.340 --> 25:27.370
2 hours of your time,100
bucks--easy sell.

25:27.380 --> 25:29.430
Just one stub's taken.

25:30.090 --> 25:33.940
Hey,well,patrick walker just joined a
pretty sweet boxing gym,but that's about it.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.760
You guys find anything?

25:36.840 --> 25:39.030
Well,I think we should go over
to victim number 2's coffee shop,

25:39.040 --> 25:40.340
see if any of these are hanging around.

25:40.350 --> 25:43.990
If all of our victims saw these fliers,we
just figured out how he casts his net.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.620
Let's do it.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.960
Have you told anyone that
you're going to therapy?

25:49.970 --> 25:51.880
I can't talk to my family about it.

25:51.890 --> 25:53.830
They'd just tell me to get over it.

25:55.800 --> 25:59.850
Tell me what kind of situations
cause you to feel anxious.

26:00.280 --> 26:06.160
Well,uh,over the holidays,I'm supposed
to go on a cave-diving trip to mexico.

26:06.170 --> 26:07.410
Cave diving?

26:07.420 --> 26:08.690
That's pretty advanced.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.000
You've scuba dived before?

26:10.010 --> 26:10.740
Oh,yeah .

26:10.750 --> 26:13.180
I got certified when I was 15.

26:13.190 --> 26:17.160
But there's no fear of the
water,so drowning's not an issue?

26:17.380 --> 26:20.640
No,I can go below the
surface in 50 feet.

26:20.650 --> 26:22.910
As long as it's open water,I'm ok.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.920
But,uh...

26:24.930 --> 26:28.510
the idea of going near a cave...

26:28.520 --> 26:30.230
really puts me in a panic.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.660
What do you start to think about?

26:33.860 --> 26:35.920
The walls.

26:36.290 --> 26:39.050
You know,they get smaller.

26:39.060 --> 26:41.950
And then,uh,they fall on top of me.

26:43.340 --> 26:46.780
And then it's dark,and I can't breathe.

26:46.980 --> 26:51.360
So when you're down
in the imaginary cave,

26:51.370 --> 26:54.930
you become trapped,and you
can't get to the surface?

26:54.940 --> 26:56.590
Yeah.

26:56.900 --> 26:59.510
You're essentially
talking about being...

26:59.520 --> 27:02.890
buried alive.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.730
Can you help me?

27:06.670 --> 27:11.790
The core of any phobia is the
feeling that we're losing control.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.300
Once we can understand and accept that,

27:14.310 --> 27:17.390
we can conquer what frightens us.

27:17.610 --> 27:22.920
I think you can get over this fear in just
one session and never feel this way again.

27:23.430 --> 27:25.120
Really?

27:25.130 --> 27:28.490
If you can come back to the
office later,we can get started.

27:32.470 --> 27:33.780
Ok.

28:04.580 --> 28:08.400
These fliers have all been hanging in places
where our victims could have seen them.

28:10.020 --> 28:10.770
What do you see?

28:10.780 --> 28:11.960
Well,look at the date.

28:11.970 --> 28:14.320
Friday,august 25.

28:14.330 --> 28:16.050
That was last summer.

28:16.060 --> 28:18.180
If he's been luring
victims for that long--

28:18.190 --> 28:20.450
there could be more
victims that we missed.

28:20.480 --> 28:23.370
We need to go back and
check the rest of that trail.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.480
How did we miss this before?

28:52.490 --> 28:54.860
Well,the trail's 40 miles long.

29:06.910 --> 29:08.410
8 graves,12 bodies.

29:08.420 --> 29:10.060
So he didn't stick to a pattern.

29:10.070 --> 29:12.090
And we have 12 more victims.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.340
The guy had a busy year.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.620
Baby girl,there's nothing to know.

29:16.630 --> 29:17.730
I hit a couple of buttons.

29:17.740 --> 29:18.700
It got stuck. That's it.

29:18.710 --> 29:19.560
What do you want?

29:19.570 --> 29:20.430
And?

29:20.440 --> 29:22.840
Ok,I freaked out,a little bit.

29:23.370 --> 29:25.100
Look here,you little busybody,

29:25.110 --> 29:27.810
I know you traced that number for
me 5 minutes ago,so give it up.

29:27.820 --> 29:30.470
Ah,yes. Changing the subject.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.740
It's listed as the goodman institute.

29:33.750 --> 29:34.860
What the hell's that?

29:34.870 --> 29:36.960
I've beyond googled this thing.

29:36.970 --> 29:40.820
To the untrained eye,it
looks totally legit.

29:40.830 --> 29:43.210
Someone went to great lengths
to make the website decent.

29:43.220 --> 29:44.620
The articles are well written.

29:44.630 --> 29:49.480
But,as my brilliant and bespectacled
eyes can see,they all lead to dead ends.

29:49.490 --> 29:50.610
Well,then what is it?

29:50.620 --> 29:54.280
A bogus business that claims to be the
leading researcher in behavioral therapy.

29:54.290 --> 29:59.590
There's no tax records,no business
license,no evidence it actually exists.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.020
It's supposed to be run by
a guy named dr.Barry goodman.

30:02.030 --> 30:05.550
Says here he's renowned in
curing fears and phobias.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.400
Get this--he has an
online questionnaire.

30:07.410 --> 30:10.030
Asks all kinds of things about phobias.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.140
So these victims fill it out and
he plucks them off the screen.

30:13.150 --> 30:15.040
Garcia,get that over to hotch.

30:15.050 --> 30:16.630
Way ahead of you,'friady cat.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.280
Of course you are.

30:27.830 --> 30:30.040
Now,it's only a basement,but...

30:30.050 --> 30:34.280
it's cool and dark,so it's
going to feel like a cave.

30:34.840 --> 30:38.030
I'll definitely take
basementcaver ove right now.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.040
You feeling relaxed?

30:40.050 --> 30:43.070
Yeah,that cup of tea
really helped calm me down.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.070
Come on. It's ok.

30:45.680 --> 30:49.160
Just remember your state of
mind gives you all the power.

30:49.170 --> 30:51.390
You're in complete control.

30:52.040 --> 30:55.010
Let's just do this
before I change my mind.

30:55.630 --> 30:57.130
Yeah.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.950
I feel a little... dizzy.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.700
It's perfectly normal to feel
uneasy during the process.

31:03.910 --> 31:06.310
Change can be uncomfortable.

31:06.980 --> 31:09.270
Just walk toward me.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.470
You're very brave,missy.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.220
Wh y areatou doing?

31:23.230 --> 31:25.100
Wait--no!

31:55.070 --> 31:56.980
You wet the bed again!

31:56.990 --> 31:58.180
I'm sorry!

31:58.540 --> 31:59.950
Now they'll all see.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.130
Stop! Don't!Stop!

32:02.140 --> 32:02.970
I've had enough.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.460
No

32:07.890 --> 32:11.230
No don't Let me out.

32:21.950 --> 32:23.970
What are you doing?

32:23.980 --> 32:25.970
Dr.Howard?

32:27.010 --> 32:28.760
Please.

32:38.730 --> 32:40.680
I'm scared.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.130
Please?

32:43.850 --> 32:44.890
Please.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.890
I wanna come out.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.510
Please!

32:58.530 --> 33:00.470
Please.Please!

33:04.890 --> 33:09.170
Maybe it's maybelline
instead of anxiety disorders.

33:09.180 --> 33:12.200
Yeah,this guy's either an amateur or
he studied psychology in the eighties.

33:12.210 --> 33:13.740
His phrasing of the
questions are clinical.

33:13.750 --> 33:14.810
This guy's a professional.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.240
Well,he's able to pick
the perfect victims.

33:16.250 --> 33:17.510
Are you close to your family?

33:17.520 --> 33:18.880
Easy making friends?

33:18.890 --> 33:20.910
Just answer yes and
you're spared the torture.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.740
We figured out how he
chooses his victims,

33:22.750 --> 33:25.360
but how does that get us his real name?

33:25.370 --> 33:26.950
All right. Let's review.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.860
J.J.,Can you get garcia?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.590
I think the guy's a real psychiatrist.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.190
Also afraid of being alone,so
he's most likely married.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.030
May have adopted children.

33:36.040 --> 33:36.710
Why?

33:36.720 --> 33:38.870
Well,because the tortures
lack a sexual component.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.300
Oh,right. He might be impotent.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.130
Hey,guys.

33:41.140 --> 33:42.950
Also,he's desperate for
a sense of community.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.310
He'd definitely have kids.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.030
Ok,I'm crossing portland
doctors with adoptions.

33:48.040 --> 33:52.120
And given the obsession to control his
victims with torture,he might have been abused.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.030
Ok,juvenile records are going to be
sealed,so you gotta give me a minute.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.770
He uses antiquated terms like
phobias,so he's most likely in his 40s.

33:58.780 --> 34:00.200
And...

34:00.210 --> 34:03.940
the creep of the moment award goes to...

34:03.950 --> 34:06.850
one 43-year-old dr.Stanley
howard,psychiatrist.

34:06.860 --> 34:08.639
This guy was killing his own patients?

34:08.650 --> 34:10.219
No. Stan howard's smarter than that.

34:10.230 --> 34:12.840
That's why he created
goodman and the research ruse.

34:12.850 --> 34:17.750
Garcia: Married to jane howard,has
one 8-year-old daughter jessica.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.340
He started a center for abused kids.

34:20.350 --> 34:21.920
Probably because he could relate.

34:21.929 --> 34:25.020
One good deed's not fortifying
his karma sufficiently.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.980
Looks like his practice
shut down last year.

34:26.989 --> 34:28.699
Right about the time
the killings started?

34:28.710 --> 34:31.330
He still has a lease on
his old office building.

34:31.340 --> 34:34.159
City permits were pulled due to
renovation,but what do you know?

34:34.170 --> 34:37.380
They've been delayed. Yikes!

34:37.389 --> 34:40.960
His bank records show a seriously
depleted savings account.

34:40.969 --> 34:43.020
So he's keeping up appearances.
Where's the building?

34:43.030 --> 34:45.000
427 cedars avenue.

34:45.010 --> 34:46.219
It's not far from here.

34:46.230 --> 34:47.250
All right. Let's go check the building.

34:47.260 --> 34:49.000
- You two- - talk
to the familyitgot .

34:49.010 --> 34:50.429
Thanks,garcia.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.520
Why do they always seem so normal?

34:58.140 --> 34:59.050
Who are you?

34:59.060 --> 35:01.840
Hi. I'm emily,and this is jennifer.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.840
You never open the door
unless you know who it is.

35:04.850 --> 35:07.440
Hello,ma'am,we're here from the fbi.

35:09.020 --> 35:10.790
Where is your husband?

35:10.800 --> 35:12.310
He's with a patient.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.400
You know,he shut down
his practice a year ago.

35:14.410 --> 35:15.450
Excuse me?

35:15.460 --> 35:16.240
No,that's not possible.

35:16.250 --> 35:19.210
He wouldn't do something like
that without talking to me first.

35:19.220 --> 35:23.360
He referred his patients to other
doctors and allowed his license to expire.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.520
What's happening?

35:31.980 --> 35:35.540
Has stan been acting strangely lately?

35:35.550 --> 35:36.830
Well,he's had...

35:36.840 --> 35:40.390
some issues since his
mother died last year,but...

35:40.720 --> 35:44.540
I mean,he refused to go to her
funeral,but they were never close.

35:45.030 --> 35:49.210
Stan always said it was because of
her that he became a psychiatrist.

35:51.630 --> 35:53.450
This is 427 cedars avenue.

35:53.460 --> 35:54.440
Where's the office?

35:54.450 --> 35:56.700
He wasn't luring
victims to an empty lot.

35:56.710 --> 35:57.810
Hey,prentiss.

35:57.820 --> 36:00.140
We're at the office.
The building's gone.

36:01.070 --> 36:03.480
Right. All right.

36:04.750 --> 36:06.820
What do you mean,it's gone?

36:06.830 --> 36:10.080
We need to figure out where
stan's been going every day.

36:13.810 --> 36:15.660
I don't know.

36:15.670 --> 36:18.410
Where would he go,mrs.Howard?

36:21.850 --> 36:25.580
my family has commercial
property downtown.I--

36:26.330 --> 36:27.990
maybe...

36:29.530 --> 36:30.510
Please.

36:31.470 --> 36:32.210
No!

36:32.220 --> 36:33.260
No,no.

36:33.270 --> 36:34.330
Is it worse than you thought?

36:34.340 --> 36:37.420
Yes,it is. You don't have to do this!

36:37.430 --> 36:40.280
I'm going to be ok! I'm going to be ok!

36:40.290 --> 36:42.770
Just--please!

36:43.250 --> 36:44.880
Just--just--
help me out.

36:44.890 --> 36:47.790
I promise I won't tell anyone anything.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.790
Just pull me out. Please?

36:50.800 --> 36:52.130
Is it worse?

36:52.140 --> 36:53.950
Oh,help me out! Please!

36:59.320 --> 37:02.850
Just... help me out!Please!

37:03.120 --> 37:04.590
No...

37:36.480 --> 37:38.180
There are no tenants in this building.

37:38.190 --> 37:39.610
These must be fake names.

37:39.620 --> 37:41.380
Helps with the ruse.

37:41.710 --> 37:43.780
Goodman's on the fifth floor.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.290
It's clear!

37:52.640 --> 37:54.060
Back area's clear!

37:54.070 --> 37:56.860
Missy cassell was the
last person to sign in.

37:56.870 --> 37:57.500
When was that?

37:57.510 --> 37:58.930
Hours ago.

37:59.330 --> 38:02.280
All right,let's split up. Calvert,you
and reid take the west side.

38:05.070 --> 38:06.810
It definitely looks
like he's still here.

38:06.820 --> 38:08.930
He's not gonna go quietly.

38:13.070 --> 38:14.960
Stan howard,fbi!

38:14.970 --> 38:17.030
Stay where you are!

38:35.050 --> 38:36.210
Morgan,slow down.

38:36.220 --> 38:38.540
Tell reid and calvert that we found him.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.120
Reid,it's morgan. We got howard.

38:41.130 --> 38:43.420
Call the fire department.
He's going to the roof.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.550
Dr.Howard?

38:51.960 --> 38:53.360
I'm aaron hotchner.

38:53.370 --> 38:55.170
I'm with the fbi.

38:55.180 --> 38:57.570
Don't ask me to come down.

38:57.580 --> 39:00.220
We found at least 15e eopl pdead.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.410
It's over.

39:03.420 --> 39:07.080
They sacrificed themselves for science.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.880
You know this is the easy way out.

39:09.890 --> 39:12.340
If you come down,we'd
like to talk to you.

39:12.690 --> 39:16.790
You know you'll never get over your fear
by killing yourself or your patients.

39:17.250 --> 39:21.000
Most people go into law enforcement
because they want to help others.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.350
Morgan: Tell us where missy is.

39:25.490 --> 39:30.970
I think your greatest fear is
that you can't save everyone.

39:32.930 --> 39:35.530
It is worse than I thought.

39:56.820 --> 39:59.930
We found missy cassell's car in a
parking lot next to the building.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.650
Howard's is around back.

40:01.660 --> 40:05.110
Before he jumped,he said that my biggest
fear was not being able to save everybody.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.400
Hotch,this guy wasn't well in the head.

40:06.410 --> 40:07.260
- You know that.
- I know that,

40:07.270 --> 40:11.060
but what I think he meant
was that she's here somewhere.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.910
I went through all of his
journals and I found missy'S.

40:18.920 --> 40:19.580
What did it say?

40:19.590 --> 40:21.630
That she was going
on a cave-diving trip.

40:21.640 --> 40:25.350
She wasn't scared of the water,but she was
terrified of the walls crumbling down on her?

40:25.360 --> 40:26.580
So what's she afraid of?

40:26.590 --> 40:28.430
Being buried alive.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.540
Guys,look at the dirt under his nails.

40:32.810 --> 40:35.170
She's gotta be close,guys.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.190
Is t bre aheasement in this building?

40:37.200 --> 40:38.580
Yes.

40:45.010 --> 40:45.910
Guys,over here.

40:45.920 --> 40:46.970
Over here. Right here.

40:46.980 --> 40:48.540
Hold that. Reid?

40:55.980 --> 40:56.740
Oh,my god.

40:57.660 --> 40:59.090
Be careful. That's her head.

41:00.290 --> 41:01.850
Help me to get her arm. Be careful.

41:01.860 --> 41:02.640
- Ready?
- Yeah.

41:02.650 --> 41:03.990
I-- oh,not too
hard. Not too hard.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.500
She might be stuck.

41:05.510 --> 41:06.710
Get
her--

41:08.930 --> 41:09.870
that's--hang
on.

41:09.880 --> 41:10.820
- Got her?
- Yeah.

41:11.110 --> 41:13.760
Can you get hold? 2...2,3.

41:18.890 --> 41:19.990
Come on.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.260
I got her.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.740
Tell them to call paramedics.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.360
I got it.

41:28.530 --> 41:29.290
Oh,my god.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.110
Missy? Missy?

41:31.120 --> 41:33.030
Ok,faint heartbeat.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.450
Clear her area.

41:34.460 --> 41:35.150
It's ok. It's all right.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.700
We're here to help. It's ok.It's ok.

41:36.710 --> 41:37.390
You're going to be all right.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.110
We're here to help you.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.760
You're going to be all right.

41:54.390 --> 41:56.270
Eleanor roosevelt once said,

41:56.280 --> 42:00.020
you gain strength,courage,and
confidence by every experience

42:00.030 --> 42:03.260
in which you really stop
to look fear in the face.

42:03.760 --> 42:07.510
You must do the thing which
you think you cannot do.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.860
I,um...

42:11.060 --> 42:12.700
Can't sleep.

42:12.710 --> 42:14.230
Hotch: Want me to turn off the light?

42:14.240 --> 42:15.530
No.

42:16.150 --> 42:18.350
I want to be able to sleep.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.240
What's the matter?

42:24.390 --> 42:26.480
What's the matter with you,hotch?

42:29.350 --> 42:32.600
You're sitting here doing work
when you'd normally take a break.

42:33.350 --> 42:36.280
Please don't tell me
it's about gideon leaving.

42:36.290 --> 42:39.980
You know,we made a deal a long
time ago not to profile each other.

42:40.610 --> 42:42.510
Am I wrong?

42:44.750 --> 42:49.180
You know,hotch,today was a
huge,huge victory for all of us.

42:49.940 --> 42:52.470
I mean,I never thought
I'd say this,but...

42:52.990 --> 42:55.970
we're doing just fine without gideon.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.400
Hotch.

43:02.150 --> 43:04.480
What's keeping you up tonight?

43:13.890 --> 43:16.010
Haley's left.

43:17.930 --> 43:20.380
And I don't know if she's coming back.
