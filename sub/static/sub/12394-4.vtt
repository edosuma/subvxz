[Jazz music]

00:04.430 --> 00:12.439
*

00:16.810 --> 00:21.076
- HEY, LOOK AT US, MAN.
WE GOT IT PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

00:21.120 --> 00:24.419
- MM. LIVING IN SANTA BARBARA.
BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.715
TWO PERFECT WOMEN ON OUR ARMS.
HOW'D WE DO IT?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.058
- HEY, HEY, IS THIS--
IS THIS POCKET SQUARE OKAY?

00:30.090 --> 00:32.593
- YEAH. YEAH. LOOKS GREAT.
- YEAH?

00:32.630 --> 00:34.188
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
ARE THOSE THE RIGHT GLASSES

00:34.230 --> 00:35.527
FOR THESE DRINKS?

00:35.560 --> 00:38.563
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
BE COOL. WE GOT THIS.

00:41.870 --> 00:44.759
HELLO, HELLO.
- WE'RE BACK.

00:44.810 --> 00:46.698
- WELL, WHAT DOES A LADY
HAVE TO DO AROUND HERE

00:46.740 --> 00:48.071
TO GET A DRY MARTINI?

00:48.110 --> 00:50.101
- PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.606
- SO ARE BROAD SHOULDERS,

00:51.650 --> 00:53.117
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I LIKE TO WAIT FOR THEM.

00:53.150 --> 00:55.209
- [laughs]
- CHEERS, LADIES.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.344
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

00:58.390 --> 01:04.158
- [coughing]

01:04.190 --> 01:06.090
- [coughs]

01:06.130 --> 01:12.137
[continues coughing]

01:13.300 --> 01:15.768
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:15.800 --> 01:18.633
- [choking coughs]

01:21.880 --> 01:24.872
- OH!
- OH!

01:24.910 --> 01:28.846
[body thuds, people scream]

01:36.290 --> 01:38.850
- WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
WHY YOU WOULD DRAG GUS AND I

01:38.890 --> 01:40.790
OUT OF BED IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT

01:40.830 --> 01:44.129
TO COME DOWN HERE AND TEND
TO AN ELDERLY WOMAN

01:44.170 --> 01:45.467
WHO IS SIMPLY
RESTING HER EYES?

01:45.500 --> 01:47.263
THIS IS NOT A CRIME SCENE.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.234
SHE'S NOT DEAD.

01:49.270 --> 01:50.908
YOU'RE NOT DEAD, ARE YOU?
- [gaSPSJ

01:50.940 --> 01:53.101
- SHAWN.
- WHAT?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.475
- AH.
- WILL YOU FOCUS, SHAWN?

01:58.510 --> 02:02.344
WE NEED THIS CASE.
DO SOMETHING.

02:15.460 --> 02:18.918
- YES. I CAN CLEARLY SEE
A VICTIM.

02:18.970 --> 02:20.562
IN THE PRIME OF HIS LIFE.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.261
- SPENCER, WE DON'T NEED
YOUR PARTICULAR BRAND

02:22.310 --> 02:23.504
OF THEATRICS
HERE THIS EVENING.

02:23.540 --> 02:24.802
GO HOME.
GO BACK TO BED.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.933
- LASSIE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.732
THE DEATH OF THIS MAN IS LIKE
STARING MY OWN MORTALITY

02:28.780 --> 02:29.747
IN THE FACE.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.247
IF SOMEONE IS OUT THERE

02:31.280 --> 02:32.816
KILLING HANDSOME
AND YOUTHFUL BACHELORS

02:32.850 --> 02:34.772
IN SANTA BARBARA,
THEN ALL OF US ARE IN DANGER.

02:34.820 --> 02:37.789
MAYBE NOT ALL OF US.
CERTAINLY GUS AND MYSELF.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.685
- SPENCER, WE'VE BEEN HERE
ALL OF EIGHT MINUTES.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.756
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE JUST SLIPPED
OFF THE BALCONY AND FELL.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.280
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
WE SHOULD ALL BE LOOKING

02:43.330 --> 02:45.184
FOR A BANANA PEEL
OR A ROLLER SKATE.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.788
PERHAPS A WET BAR OF SOAP,

02:46.830 --> 02:48.650
THOUGH THAT SEEMS
THE UNLIKELIEST OF THE THREE.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.828
- MCNAB, PLEASE ESCORT
THESE GENTLEMEN OUT OF HERE.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.631
- OKAY, LASSIE.
OKAY, YOU WIN.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.773
NO REASON TO GET EXCITED.

03:02.810 --> 03:07.679
BUZZ, I THINK
WE CAN SEE OURSELVES OUT.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.484
NO SIGN OF WRIST FRACTURES
OR ANKLE FRACTURES.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.954
TELL ME THIS GUY DIDN'T TRY
TO BRACE HIS FALL FROM 20 FEET.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.548
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S START GETTING
WITNESS STATEMENTS.

03:14.590 --> 03:15.682
WHO DO YOU WANT,
THE CREEPY OLD LADIES

03:15.720 --> 03:17.221
OR THE KEN DOLLS?

03:17.260 --> 03:20.491
- THE KEN DOLLS.

03:20.530 --> 03:21.849
- WE'RE STILL WAITING
FOR TOXICOLOGY

03:21.900 --> 03:23.663
TO CONFIRM, BUT IT DOES LOOK
LIKE HE WAS DEAD

03:23.700 --> 03:24.962
BEFORE HE HIT THE GROUND.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.558
APPEARS TO BE POISONING.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.966
SO KUDOS, MR. SPENCER.
SORRY, CARLTON.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.604
- IN LASSIE'S DEFENSE,

03:30.640 --> 03:32.335
TOXICOLOGY IS NOT A SCIENCE.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.972
- ACTUALLY, IT'S A SCIENCE
OF STUDYING TOXINS.

03:34.010 --> 03:34.977
- GET OUT OF HERE.
- NO, IT IS.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.409
- WELL, I GUESS THAT DOES

03:36.450 --> 03:37.940
MAKE YOU LOOK
A LITTLE FOOLISH.

03:37.980 --> 03:38.969
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'VE GOT THE HOME RUN SUSPECT

03:39.010 --> 03:40.773
ON THIS ONE.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.685
ONCE I WAS GIVEN FIVE MINUTES
TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS,

03:42.720 --> 03:45.439
I RECOGNIZED THE VICTIM'S DATE
AS ONE GILLIAN TUCKER.

03:45.490 --> 03:48.288
FORMERLY
MRS. GILLIAN VANDERHOLT.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.856
- I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED HER.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.653
SHE USED TO BE MARRIED
TO WALTER VANDERHOLT.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.590
- CLOSED THE CASE
ON HIS SUICIDE FIVE MONTHS AGO,

03:53.630 --> 03:55.325
BUT SOMETHING NEVER SAT RIGHT
WITH ME.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.759
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

03:56.800 --> 03:57.789
- I THINK
SHE MURDERED HER HUSBAND

03:57.830 --> 03:58.865
AND GOT AWAY WITH IT.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.969
NOW SHE'S DATING OUR VICTIM

04:00.000 --> 04:01.592
AND SUDDENLY HE'S DEAD TOO?

04:01.640 --> 04:03.335
COME ON, CHIEF.
LET ME RUN WITH THIS ONE.

04:03.370 --> 04:06.032
- WHAT IF WE LET THEM
WORK TOGETHER?

04:06.070 --> 04:08.038
SEPARATELY, BUT TOGETHER?

04:08.080 --> 04:10.776
- THAT LONELY BALD GUY
IN THE CORNER MAKES NO SENSE.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.038
- AM I THE ONLY PERSON
THAT'S FREAKED OUT

04:12.080 --> 04:13.638
HE'S BEEN SITTING THERE
THE WHOLE TIME?

04:13.680 --> 04:14.772
- HENRY, THIS IS YOUR CALL.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.481
YOU'RE THE ONE IN CHARGE
OF CONSULTANTS.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.942
- YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF THE COMPETITION,

04:17.990 --> 04:19.685
ARE YOU, SHAWN?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.779
- OF COURSE NOT, AS LONG
AS IT DOESN'T INVOLVE

04:21.820 --> 04:23.287
PEOPLE TRYING
TO BEST EACH OTHER.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.922
- WELL, I'M UP FOR IT.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.896
MATTER OF FACT,
I'VE ALREADY WON.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.809
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

04:36.840 --> 04:38.569
*

04:38.610 --> 04:40.578
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:40.610 --> 04:42.646
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

04:42.680 --> 04:43.942
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:43.980 --> 04:45.675
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

04:45.710 --> 04:47.075
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

04:47.120 --> 04:49.418
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

04:49.450 --> 04:50.940
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

04:50.990 --> 04:53.083
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

04:53.120 --> 04:56.385
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

05:01.730 --> 05:03.322
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BAG AND TAG EVERYTHING

05:03.370 --> 05:04.394
IN THE VICTIM'S
MEDICINE CABINET

05:04.430 --> 05:06.398
AND MOVE ON OVER TO GILLIAN
THE CRADLE ROBBER'S.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.068
- I JUST--WHY IS IT
THAT A WEALTHY OLDER MAN

05:09.100 --> 05:11.568
CAN DATE A YOUNGER WOMAN
AND HE'S A HERO,

05:11.610 --> 05:13.669
YET AN OLDER WOMAN CHOOSES
TO EMPOWER HERSELF

05:13.710 --> 05:15.029
AND DATE A YOUNGER MAN,

05:15.080 --> 05:16.968
SHE'S CONSIDERED SOME SORT
OF SOCIAL PARIAH?

05:17.010 --> 05:18.807
- 'CAUSE IT'S GROSS.
- UGH.

05:18.850 --> 05:21.842
- HOLY--! SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.689
- SORRY, LASSIE,
IT WAS NOT MY INTENT

05:23.720 --> 05:25.642
TO CAUSE YOU TO MAKE THAT NOISE
IN FRONT OF THE GROUP.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.954
BUT IN ORDER TO GET
INTO THE MINDSET OF THE VICTIM,

05:27.990 --> 05:30.083
I RENTED AMERICAN GIGOLO
LAST NIGHT.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.882
- YOU THINK
THIS IS PROSTITUTION?

05:31.930 --> 05:34.751
- LANCE TOLKIN
DIDN'T HAVE A JOB, JULES.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.597
HE'S DATING A WOMAN
TWICE HIS AGE

05:36.630 --> 05:39.929
AND HAS A SUPER TROOPERS
PINBALL MACHINE IN HIS BEDROOM.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.699
IT DIDN'T PAY FOR ITSELF.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.698
[grunts]

05:49.750 --> 05:52.617
GUS, I'M GONNA NEED
SOME HELP HERE.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.140
[grunting]

05:54.180 --> 05:56.887
- JUST STAY OUT OF OUR WAY,
SPENCER.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.959
- [grunting]

06:02.690 --> 06:04.089
[grunts]

06:13.140 --> 06:14.960
KILLING WITH CLASS:

06:15.000 --> 06:17.503
THE ART OF SEDUCTION THROUGH
CHARM AND SOPHISTICATION.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.508
QUESTION IS "WHO EXACTLY
IS HE KILLING?"

06:19.540 --> 06:23.909
- HMM. MM. "TO LANCE,
ONE OF MY MOST ARTFUL

06:23.950 --> 06:25.702
"AND GENTLEMANLY STUDENTS.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.617
HAPPY HUNTING.
CORDIALLY, CLIVE PRESCOTT."

06:28.650 --> 06:32.518
- CLIVE...PRESCOTT.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.629
GUS, I DO BELIEVE
WE FOUND A LEAD OF OUR OWN.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.992
- HOW'S YOUR FEET?
- [peevish] I CAN'T FEEL THEM.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.895
- SWEET.
- WAIT, GUS!

06:42.930 --> 06:44.761
I NEED YOU TO BE MY LEGS!

06:48.870 --> 06:51.703
- GENTLEMEN, IF YOU WANT
TO CONTINUE TO SPEND YOUR NIGHTS

06:51.740 --> 06:53.970
WITH DINER WAITRESSES
AND TOLLBOOTH ATTENDANTS,

06:54.010 --> 06:56.604
THEN BY ALL MEANS
CARRY ON YOUR MISERABLE WAY.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.901
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO SURROUND YOURSELF

06:57.950 --> 07:01.169
WITH SOPHISTICATION,
WITH ELEGANT WOMEN

07:01.220 --> 07:05.509
WHO CAN GIVE YOU ANYTHING
YOUR HEART DESIRES,

07:05.550 --> 07:06.915
THEN ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION

07:06.960 --> 07:08.609
WHAT IS THE PICTURE

07:08.660 --> 07:10.127
THAT YOU ARE PAINTING
OF YOURSELF?

07:10.160 --> 07:13.493
- WHAT IS THIS?
LIKE, FIGHT CLUB FOR BUTLERS?

07:13.530 --> 07:17.728
- FOR INSTANCE, WHAT DID THESE
TWO, UH, BOYS DO WRONG?

07:17.770 --> 07:19.226
- AH, THERE MUST BE SOME SORT
OF MISTAKE.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.567
WE'RE NOT STUDENTS.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.192
I'M PSYCHIC DETECTIVE
SHAWN SPENCER.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.901
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
CHAZ BONO.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.635
- "PSYCHIC DETECTIVE."

07:25.670 --> 07:27.570
GENTLEMEN, THIS IS JUST
WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.

07:27.610 --> 07:28.975
IF YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE
A FAKE OCCUPATION,

07:29.010 --> 07:30.671
AT LEAST MAKE IT SOUND REAL.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.712
- I'M ALSO
A PHARMACEUTICAL SALESMAN.

07:32.750 --> 07:33.910
- WELL, THAT SOUNDS PATHETIC.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.144
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SEXY.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.886
- WHOA, SERIOUSLY, DUDE,

07:36.920 --> 07:40.754
THIS WHOLE GENTLEMAN THING'S
NOT FOR ME.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.156
I MEAN, IT'S A LITTLE BIT DATED,
DON'T YOU THINK?

07:43.190 --> 07:45.750
- WHAT I THINK IS THAT
WITH MY METHOD,

07:45.790 --> 07:49.669
THERE IS NO ELIGIBLE WOMAN
I COULDN'T SEDUCE.

07:49.700 --> 07:53.693
HOW ABOUT YOU?
- [laughs]

07:53.740 --> 07:55.833
LET'S JUST SAY I DO FINE
ON MY OWN, OKAY?

07:55.870 --> 07:57.963
I'M GOOD.
- REALLY?

07:58.010 --> 08:00.035
- REALLY?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN REALLY?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.672
WHAT DO YOU MEAN REALLY?

08:01.710 --> 08:03.974
- WHEN WAS YOUR LAST
SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP?

08:04.010 --> 08:05.147
- DEFINE RELATIONSHIP.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.772
- "THE WAY IN WHICH

08:06.820 --> 08:08.776
"TWO OR MORE CONCEPTS, OBJECTS,
OR PEOPLE ARE CONNECTED

08:08.820 --> 08:10.685
OR THE STATE OF BEING
CONNECTED."

08:10.720 --> 08:12.142
WEBSTER.

08:12.190 --> 08:13.817
- I HARDLY THINK EMMANUEL LEWIS
IS AN AUTHORITY

08:13.860 --> 08:15.589
ON RELATIONSHIPS.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.826
- MAY I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

08:16.860 --> 08:18.225
- SURE.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.148
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TESTED
FOR IDIOCY?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.997
- WE'RE HERE TO CONDUCT
OFFICIAL POLICE BUSINESS

08:22.030 --> 08:24.828
AND WE'VE GOT SOME PRETTY
SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR YOU

08:24.870 --> 08:26.758
ABOUT THE DEATH
OF ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.566
LANCE TOLKIN.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.602
- GENTLEMEN, I THINK
WE CAN CALL IT A DAY.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.843
- I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE'S NOT GONNA SHOW.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.713
BY NOW, SHE'S PROBABLY HALFWAY
TO ACAPULCO.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.217
- CARLTON, LET'S NOT JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.115
GILLIAN TUCKER IS STILL
A VERY PROMINENT WOMAN

08:48.160 --> 08:49.684
IN THIS TOWN.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.685
- LOOK, O'HARA, IN MY BOOK,

08:50.730 --> 08:51.754
IT'S PRETTY CUT AND DRY.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.291
THIS SICK TWIST

08:53.330 --> 08:55.252
SEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO OFF
HER RICH, OLDER HUSBAND

08:55.300 --> 08:57.222
AND THEN SHE GETS HERSELF
A LITTLE BOY TOY.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.194
BUT WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE HE FIGURES OUT HER SECRET.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.867
SO SHE DECIDES
TO OFF HIM TOO

09:01.900 --> 09:04.209
AND THEN IT'S ON
TO THE NEXT SET OF PECS.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.867
MAYBE THE KILLING FEELS GOOD.

09:05.910 --> 09:08.708
LIKE THE SOI-T, SUPPLE FLESH
OF A MAN-BUCK.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.276
- YOU DISTURB ME.

09:10.310 --> 09:12.915
AND YOUR THEORY ON THIS MURDER
DISTURBS ME.

09:12.950 --> 09:14.747
AND YOU DISTURB ME.

09:14.780 --> 09:16.714
- YOU SAID THAT TWICE.
- YES.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.684
- I'M SO SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING, OFFICERS.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.278
THIS WHOLE ORDEAL--
SINCE IT HAPPENED,

09:20.320 --> 09:22.049
I'M JUST BESIDE MYSELF.

09:22.090 --> 09:25.127
I FIND IT DIFFICULT
JUST GETTING OUT OF BED.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.696
- MISS TUCKER,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

09:26.730 --> 09:28.027
FOR COMING DOWN HERE.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.721
WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE
OF QUESTIONS.

09:29.770 --> 09:34.969
- PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.707
- THANK YOU.

09:37.740 --> 09:41.005
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE ME,
MISS TUCKER?

09:41.040 --> 09:42.974
I WAS THE DETECTIVE

09:43.010 --> 09:45.046
LOOKING INTO YOUR LATE
HUSBAND'S SUICIDE.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.718
- NO, I BELIEVE
THAT WAS A MUCH YOUNGER MAN.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.342
LESS SALT AND PEPPER.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.747
- WE ARE VERY, VERY SORRY

09:51.790 --> 09:53.610
FOR YOUR LOSS, MISS TUCKER.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.652
AND, SERIOUSLY--I'M SORRY--
YOU JUST GOT OUT OF BED?

09:56.690 --> 10:00.023
- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A FUNNY WAY
OF MOURNING.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.153
YOU SURE DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME
GETTING BACK UP ON THAT HORSE

10:02.200 --> 10:03.690
AI-TER YOUR HUSBAND'S DEATH.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.698
- I'M LATE
FOR A BUSINESS MEETING.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.630
AND I DON'T RIDE HORSES,
DETECTIVE.

10:07.670 --> 10:10.138
- MISS TUCKER,
ARE YOU TRYING TO SEDUCE ME?

10:10.170 --> 10:13.731
- NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.908
I'M NOT GONNA LIE,
I WAS NOT IN A HAPPY MARRIAGE.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.702
BUT I HAVE MY OWN WAY
OF MOURNING

10:18.750 --> 10:20.638
AND I ASSUME
YOU HAVE YOURS AS WELL.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.013
WHAT IS A WOMAN MY AGE SUPPOSED
TO DO, DETECTIVE, KNIT?

10:24.050 --> 10:28.259
- CARLTON, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

10:30.730 --> 10:34.393
NOW? HMM?

10:34.430 --> 10:37.661
CARLTON, SHE IS NOT GOING
TO A BUSINESS MEETING.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.167
I THINK SHE'S GOING
ON A DATE.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.861
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.663
- WELL, WHO'S SHE DOING
HER HAIR AND MAKEUP FOR, YOU?

10:42.710 --> 10:44.234
- MAYBE.

10:44.270 --> 10:45.669
- CARLTON, IT'S CALLED
BEING A DETECTIVE

10:45.710 --> 10:47.177
AND A WOMAN.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.734
SHE'S BEING INTERVIEWED
BY TWO HOMICIDE COPS

10:48.780 --> 10:50.145
AND SHE'S PRIMPING LIKE THAT?

10:50.180 --> 10:51.772
NOT FOR A MEETING.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.277
AND IF SHE'S LYING
ABOUT WHERE SHE'S GOING,

10:53.320 --> 10:54.673
SHE'S LYING
ABOUT OTHER THINGS TOO.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.675
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.744
WE SHOULD TAIL HER.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.041
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.443
- O'HARA, WOULD YOU STOP
DISAGREEING WITH ME

10:59.490 --> 11:01.082
WHEN I'M AGREEING WITH YOU?

11:01.120 --> 11:05.750
- MM.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.155
- CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT LANCE TOLKIN?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.349
- "CAN I"?

11:08.400 --> 11:09.765
MEANING DO I HAVE
THE NEUROLOGICAL

11:09.800 --> 11:10.926
AND VERBAL ABILITY TO DO SO?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.289
- SORRY. WILL YOU?

11:12.330 --> 11:14.332
- I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS.

11:14.370 --> 11:15.769
- MAYBE ON A FARM YOU HAVE.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.268
LANCE TOLKIN
HAD NOT YET MASTERED THE ART

11:18.310 --> 11:20.175
OF, UM...MANNERS.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.404
I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.409
- I'M SENSING
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.145
DIDN'T YOU REFER TO HIM

11:26.180 --> 11:30.310
AS ONE OF YOUR MOST
"ARTFUL" STUDENTS?

11:30.350 --> 11:32.113
- ONE POINT FOR YOU,
PSYCHIC.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.459
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

11:34.490 --> 11:36.151
- LOOK, WAS HE A GOOD STUDENT?
YES.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.259
DID HE SHOW POTENTIAL?

11:37.290 --> 11:38.826
PERHAPS MORE THAN THE OTHERS.

11:38.860 --> 11:42.489
HE WAS GOOD. BUT MAYBE NOT
AS GOOD AS HE THOUGHT.

11:42.530 --> 11:43.497
[stamps forcefully]

11:43.530 --> 11:45.088
- YOU SOUND A LITTLE ANGRY.

11:45.130 --> 11:46.939
- ANGER IS EASY.

11:46.970 --> 11:49.859
A GENTLEMEN TAKES HIS IRE
AND TURNS IT INTO INSIGHT.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.060
THAT'S IN CHAPTER THREE
OF MY BOOK.

11:52.110 --> 11:54.704
GOOD DAY.

11:58.210 --> 12:01.213
- WHAT IS THAT?

12:02.520 --> 12:04.818
- "DEAR GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRIES

12:04.850 --> 12:06.249
"ABOUT THE DEATH
OF MY FORMER STUDENT

12:07.790 --> 12:09.348
"GOOD LUCK
WITH THE INVESTIGATION.

12:09.390 --> 12:11.426
CORDIALLY, CLIVE PRESCOTT."

12:11.460 --> 12:14.156
- WHAT THE...?
- IT'S A THANK YOU NOTE.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.758
THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.825
- THIS GUY'S PLAYING
WITH US, GUS.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.862
THIS WHOLE GENTLEMAN THING
IS A SHAM.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.765
I'M GONNA PROVE IT TOO.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.778
- EYES PEELED, O'HARA.

12:29.810 --> 12:34.270
THIS IS WHERE WE LET HER
HANG HERSELF.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.118
WHAT--
GUSTER, WHAT THE HE--?

12:37.150 --> 12:38.879
- THAT'S A GOOD WAY
TO GET YOURSELF SHOT.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.854
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU WEARING, SPENCER?

12:40.890 --> 12:43.529
- I AIN'T SPENCER.
I'M SOUP CAN SAM.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.221
AND UNLIKE SOME DETECT IVES,

12:45.260 --> 12:47.057
WHEN GUS AND I SHOW UP
FOR A STAKEOUT,

12:47.100 --> 12:48.897
WE TRY TO BLEND IN
WITH THE REGULAR PEOPLE.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.466
- WHO'S GUS SUPPOSED TO BE?

12:50.500 --> 12:51.797
- I'M A REGULAR GUY IN A CAR.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.138
I'LL BLEND IN FINE.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.797
- WELL, AT LEAST SOMEONE
FINALLY REALIZED

12:54.840 --> 12:55.795
WHO THE RIGHT SUSPECT IS.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.364
- I GUESS SOMEONE DID.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.968
- WAIT, HE THINKS
WE'RE TAILING HER?

12:59.010 --> 13:00.477
- SHH.

13:00.510 --> 13:01.829
- SHE'S OBVIOUSLY MEETING
A NEW BOY TOY.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.098
MAYBE ONE EVEN YOUNGER
THAN THE LAST.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.845
- YOUNGER?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.541
WHO DO YOU THINK SHE'S
MEETING WITH, JUSTIN BIEBER?

13:07.580 --> 13:09.445
- LASSIE, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
THE POSSIBILITY

13:09.480 --> 13:10.879
THAT SHE'S THE VICTIM HERE?

13:10.920 --> 13:14.811
- OH, SHH, HERE WE GO.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.021
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?
- THAT'S OUR GUY.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.527
CLIVE PRESCOTT.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.458
- SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING AT?

13:19.490 --> 13:21.048
- WE KNOW WHO THE MURDERER IS.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.261
AND WE HAVE
THE HOME RUN SUSPECT.

13:23.300 --> 13:27.464
AND HE IS SANTA BARBARA'S
BIGGEST DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDREL.

13:32.470 --> 13:33.573
- THE COPS ALREADY GOT
MY STATEMENT

13:33.610 --> 13:34.372
THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME.

13:34.410 --> 13:36.071
- I KNOW.
WE READ YOUR STATEMENT,

13:36.110 --> 13:37.304
BUT WE HAVE QUESTIONS
OF OUR OWN.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.375
WE NOW BELIEVE SOMEONE MAY HAVE
POISONED MR. TOLKIN'S DRINK.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.116
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HIS
DRINK ORDERS WERE THAT NIGHT?

13:41.150 --> 13:44.483
- NORMALLY I WOULDN'T,
BUT HIS CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.182
IT WAS DIFFERENT.
CLASSY. COOL.

13:47.220 --> 13:51.350
- YES. SEA BREEZE.
- NO. UH, GABARDINE HIGHTAIL.

13:51.390 --> 13:53.551
TWO PARTS BRORA SCOTCH.
ONE PART DRAMBUIE.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.489
A TEASPOON OF HONEY.
IT WAS MR. TOLKIN'S FAVORITE.

13:56.530 --> 13:58.464
IN FACT, MISS TUCKER
BROUGHT HER PRIVATE BOTTLE

13:58.500 --> 14:00.468
OF BRORA SCOTCH FOR ME TO KEEP
BEHIND THE BAR THAT NIGHT

14:00.500 --> 14:01.467
JUST FOR MR. TOLKIN.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.439
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
THAT BOTTLE.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.903
- YES, DAD.
WE'RE FOLLOWING HIM NOW.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.542
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T ASK
TO SIT IN THE BACK SEAT.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.309
- YOUR HUNCH WAS MORE
THAN GOOD, SHAWN.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.181
PRESCOTT'S LAST KNOWN LIAISON

14:17.220 --> 14:18.642
WAS LORRAINE BELLE,

14:18.690 --> 14:21.158
ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST WIDOWS
IN SANTA BARBARA.

14:21.190 --> 14:23.226
- MAYBE WE SHOULD CHECK HER OUT
WHEN WE'RE FINISHED HERE.

14:23.260 --> 14:24.284
- YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE
KIND OF HARD.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.218
SHE'S DEAD.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.319
SHE WENT ON VACATION
WITH PRESCOTT TO SOUTH AMERICA.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.420
NEVER CAME BACK.
DIED IN A DROWNING ACCIDENT.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.267
- THAT'S INTERESTING, POP,
BUT HE'S SLOWING DOWN.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.562
WE GOT TO GO.
- WAIT, WAIT, SHAWN.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.329
I THINK THIS GUY'S DANGEROUS.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.429
I WANT YOU TO BE CAREFUL.
- I PROMISE.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.006
[hangs up]

14:40.040 --> 14:42.076
I THINK MY DAD'S
STARTING TO LIKE ME.

14:42.110 --> 14:45.147
- LOOK AT THAT, GUS,
HE'S LITERALLY TAKING HER

14:45.180 --> 14:46.499
TO THE BANK.

14:46.550 --> 14:49.474
- WHAT'S THE NEXT STOP,
THE CLEANERS?

14:54.320 --> 14:56.515
DUDE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE WERE JUST GONNA FOLLOW HIM.

14:56.560 --> 15:01.623
- THAT WOULDN'T BE VERY MUCH FUN
NOW WOULD IT, GUS?

15:01.660 --> 15:05.289
[jar slams]

15:05.330 --> 15:07.230
- WHAT ARE YOU GENTLEMEN
DOING HERE?

15:07.270 --> 15:08.464
- I'M HERE TO SEE MY MONEY.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.309
THEY KEEP IT IN A SPECIAL ROOM
IN THE BACK

15:10.340 --> 15:12.001
WITH A TRAMPOLINE.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.439
I'M GONNA ROLL AROUND IN IT
FOR A WHILE.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.334
MAYBE MAKE IT RAIN.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.348
SORT OF LIKE THAT MOVIE
INDECENT PROPOSAL

15:17.380 --> 15:19.143
EXCEPT NO SEX--MAYBE SEX.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.444
MISS TUCKER,
I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.584
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE
FOR THE SBPD.

15:23.620 --> 15:27.408
[sniffs] I'M SENSING
THAT YOU ENJOY THE COMPANY

15:27.460 --> 15:30.429
OF YOUNGER MEN.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.257
AND FOR OBVIOUS REASONS,

15:32.290 --> 15:34.292
I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES
OFF OF YOU.

15:34.330 --> 15:37.561
- [chuckles]

15:37.600 --> 15:40.728
- IF YOU'RE DONE SNIFFING US,
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

15:40.770 --> 15:44.399
EXCUSE US.
- [chuckles]

15:44.440 --> 15:46.533
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
- THE MANAGER'S HAIR?

15:46.570 --> 15:49.437
- NO.
- YOU HEARD WHAT MY DAD SAID.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.675
THIS GUY FLEECES WOMEN
AND THEY END UP DEAD.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.075
WE GOT TO KEEP HIM
AWAY FROM HER,

15:53.120 --> 15:54.371
SLOW DOWN THIS TRAIN

15:54.420 --> 15:55.478
UNTIL WE HAVE THE PROOF
THAT WE NEED.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.249
- SHAWN, IS THIS ABOUT
YOUR EGO

15:57.290 --> 15:59.042
AND TRYING TO PROVE YOU HAVE
MORE GAME THAN THIS GUY?

15:59.090 --> 16:00.318
- GUS, I'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE OFFENDED.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.611
THAT WOULD BE A NICE BONUS.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.185
- YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
- [CIICKS tongue]

16:12.230 --> 16:15.529
MISS TUCKER, I APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING SO ABRUPT,

16:15.570 --> 16:18.539
BUT AS A PSYCHIC,
MY GII-T IS CONNECTION.

16:18.570 --> 16:21.403
KNOWING WITHOUT SAYING.
LEARNING WITHOUT ASKING.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.408
EATING WITHOUT CHEWING.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.475
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE
TO ACCOMPANY YOU

16:25.510 --> 16:26.738
ON THE TOWN THIS EVENING.

16:26.780 --> 16:30.011
PERHAPS
WE COULD PAINT IT PURPLE

16:30.050 --> 16:32.587
SINCE WE WERE BOTH BORN
IN FEBRUARY.

16:32.620 --> 16:35.009
- THAT'S AMAZING.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

16:35.060 --> 16:37.449
- LITTLE BIT OF THIS,
WHOLE LOT OF THAT,

16:37.490 --> 16:39.048
AND JUST A TINGE OF--

16:39.090 --> 16:40.489
- UM, WOULD YOU MIND
IF I HAD A WORD

16:40.530 --> 16:42.452
WITH MR. SPENCER?

16:42.500 --> 16:44.468
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

16:44.500 --> 16:45.728
- OBVIOUSLY, I'M FLIRTING
WITH A NEWLY AVAILABLE WIDOW

16:45.770 --> 16:47.431
THAT HAPPENS TO BE YOUR DEAR,
DEAR FRIEND.

16:47.470 --> 16:48.289
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE WAY OUT
OF YOUR LEAGUE.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.796
SO WHY DON'T YOU BACK OUT?

16:49.840 --> 16:51.569
- OH, YOU THINK I CAN'T HANDLE
YOUR GAME?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.339
- IT'S NOT A GAME.
THAT'S YOUR FIRST MISTAKE.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.574
- [gasps] YOU JUST PUSHED
MY COMPETITIVE BUTTON

16:54.610 --> 16:56.430
AND NOW IT'S ON.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.402
- I'D BE FRIGHTENED IF YOU WERE
WEARING ANY BUTTONS.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.771
MISS TUCKER, I AM SO SORRY
TO HAVE EXPOSED YOU

17:00.820 --> 17:02.617
TO THESE JUVENILE ANTICS.

17:02.650 --> 17:05.813
- CLIVE, I THINK
HE'S RATHER ADORABLE.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.353
- SO IS A GIBBON, BUT HAVE YOU
EVER TRIED TO EAT WITH ONE?

17:08.390 --> 17:11.587
NOW, THIS MAN-BOY HERE
LACKS ALL CULTURE, ELEGANCE,

17:11.630 --> 17:13.393
AND HE SMELLS
OF BUFFALO WINGS.

17:13.430 --> 17:16.422
- HA! THAT IS WHERE
YOU ARE WRONG, SIR.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.325
WHAT YOU'RE SMELLING
ARE BUFFALO WING FLAVORED

17:18.370 --> 17:20.338
SNYDER'S PRETZELS
OF HANOVER.

17:20.370 --> 17:23.635
- IT'S AMERICA'S PRETZEL.
- AND HANOVER'S, OBVIOUSLY.

17:23.670 --> 17:25.365
- [laughs]

17:25.410 --> 17:28.174
- DO YOU SEE NOW WHY THIS
WOULD BE SUCH A BAD MISTAKE?

17:28.210 --> 17:30.599
- GILLIAN, HAVE YOU EVER DATED
A MAN WHO WAS TRIPLE-JOINTED?

17:30.650 --> 17:33.369
- WOW.
- NO, I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.739
- THAT'S A SHAME.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.111
I WAS HOPING TO DISCUSS IT
WITH YOU TONIGHT

17:36.150 --> 17:37.640
ON OUR DATE.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.442
- WELL, I MUST SAY
YOU ARE AN ORIGINAL,

17:39.490 --> 17:41.310
SHAWN SPENCER.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.089
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR

17:43.130 --> 17:44.483
TO DINE WITH YOU,

17:44.530 --> 17:45.781
AND PRECISELY
WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW.

17:45.830 --> 17:49.095
- YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.358
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.322
I'M SORRY. I'M GONNA HAVE
TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW

17:52.370 --> 17:55.089
OR I'M NOT GONNA BE READY
FOR TONIGHT. I'M SORRY, CLIVE.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.506
- GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO OPEN
THIS SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX

17:57.540 --> 18:01.374
SOME OTHER TIME.

18:01.410 --> 18:02.707
- ONE STIPULATION.

18:02.740 --> 18:04.549
MY FRIEND EUGENIA
WAS RECENTLY DISAPPOINTED

18:04.580 --> 18:05.808
BY A GENTLEMAN FRIEND

18:05.850 --> 18:07.317
AND SHE COULD USE
SOME COMPANY.

18:07.350 --> 18:08.874
DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE FOR HER?

18:08.920 --> 18:11.184
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,

18:11.220 --> 18:14.485
I HAVE THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.151
- SHAWN,
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

18:19.190 --> 18:20.623
- GUS, DON'T BE
GEORGE HAMILTON'S REACTION

18:20.660 --> 18:22.491
WHEN ASHLEY CAME TO HIM

18:22.530 --> 18:24.259
AND SAID "DAD, I THINK
I'LL BECOME AN ACTOR TOO."

18:24.300 --> 18:26.461
[whispers] KEEP AN OPEN MIND.
THIS IS ABOUT SOLVING A MURDER.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.628
HELLO, LADIES.
YOUR TRAMPS HAVE ARRIVED.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.900
- HELLO.
- [laughs]

18:31.940 --> 18:33.669
WELL, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

18:33.710 --> 18:37.840
I ALWAYS LIKE TO GIVE A LITTLE
GET-TO-KNOW-YOU SOMETHING.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.643
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.513
THIS 15--
WOW.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.381
[laughs]

18:44.420 --> 18:45.819
WOW.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.613
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD,

18:47.660 --> 18:49.616
ONLY BECAUSE
I DON'T WEAR EARRINGS.

18:49.660 --> 18:51.457
I MEAN, I USED TO
BACK IN THE DAY.

18:51.490 --> 18:53.856
THREE OF THEM. BUT THAT WAS
JUST BECAUSE OF TEARS FOR FEARS.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.391
- SHAWN, THOSE ARE CUFFLINKS.
- [laughs] COURSE THEY ARE, GUS.

18:56.430 --> 19:00.491
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
- OH. UM, GUS.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.837
- YES.

19:01.870 --> 19:04.361
- UH, WOULD YOU CARE
FOR SOME GUM?

19:04.410 --> 19:08.574
OH, I ONLY HAVE, UH,
ONE PIECE LEI-T.

19:08.610 --> 19:13.843
WE COULD SPLIT IT.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.518
- EUGENIA'S BEEN STAYING WITH ME
SINCE WALTER DIED.

19:15.550 --> 19:17.609
SHE DOESN'T LIKE
TO GO OUT MUCH.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.242
IT HASN'T WORKED OUT
WITH ANY OF THE MEN

19:19.290 --> 19:20.416
I'VE SET HER UP WITH.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.485
MAYBE GUS WILL BE THE ONE.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.421
GENIE, ISN'T GUS HANDSOME?
- [chuckles]

19:25.460 --> 19:27.894
- OOH.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.898
- EUGENIA, DON'T LOOK.
DON'T LOOK. DON'T LOOK.

19:29.930 --> 19:32.398
GABE MCKINLEY'S OVER THERE
WITH THAT TRAM P, OLIVIA AINSLEY.

19:32.430 --> 19:34.830
- [gasps] OH.

19:34.870 --> 19:36.497
- GABE WAS EUGENIA'S DATE
AT THE BENEFIT.

19:36.540 --> 19:37.837
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

19:37.870 --> 19:39.735
- AH.
- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

19:39.770 --> 19:45.299
- WE BOTH ARE SO SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.601
[whispers] YOU'RE NOT PULLING
YOUR WEIGHT.

19:46.650 --> 19:48.311
- [whispers] I'M TRYING.

19:48.350 --> 19:49.544
EVERY TIME I SMILE AT HER,
SHE PUCKERS AT ME.

19:49.580 --> 19:50.911
I'M NOT USED
TO THE PUCKER, SHAWN.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.212
- GILLIAN SAID
SHE'S INTO GARDENING.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.387
ASK HER ABOUT FLOWERS.

19:53.420 --> 19:54.409
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT FLOWERS.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.882
- JUST ASK HER SOMETHING!

19:55.920 --> 19:58.525
AH, SORRY.
- SO, EUGENIA...

19:58.560 --> 20:01.393
- YES.
- EXACTLY HOW OLD ARE YOU?

20:01.430 --> 20:03.227
- [slams table]

20:03.270 --> 20:05.488
- THIS IS THE LIMOUX VIVENTI
CABERNET DUMONT.

20:05.530 --> 20:06.519
- OH.
- MAY I?

20:06.570 --> 20:09.266
- "MAY YOU" OR "CAN YOU"?

20:09.300 --> 20:10.437
- I THINK HE GOT IT RIGHT
THE FIRST TIME.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.335
- ALL RIGHT.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.008
ACTUALLY, WE HAVEN'T
ORDERED WINE.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.576
- THIS WINE IS COMPLIMENTS
OF THE GENTLEMAN

20:15.610 --> 20:19.478
SITTING RIGHT THERE.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.341
- OH.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.348
- [whispers] HE'S GETTING UP.
TAKE HIM OUT.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.846
- [whispers] WHAT?
"TAKE HIM OUT"?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.346
- SWEEP THE LEG.
- I'M NOT SWEEPING HIS LEG.

20:26.390 --> 20:28.858
- WHY WON'T YOU EVER
SWEEP THE LEG?

20:28.890 --> 20:30.551
- GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

20:30.590 --> 20:32.023
- WELL, THIS IS UNFORTUNATE,
ISN'T IT?

20:32.060 --> 20:33.357
TO WALK ALL THE WAY
OVER HERE

20:33.400 --> 20:34.719
ONLY TO DISCOVER
THAT THERE IS NOT ROOM

20:34.760 --> 20:36.455
AT THIS TABLE FOR YOU.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.288
[whispers] OUCH.
- SHAWN, DON'T BE SILLY.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.591
THERE'S AN EMPTY SEAT
RIGHT HERE.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.835
- THANK YOU
FOR THAT GRACIOUS INVITATION.

20:43.870 --> 20:45.758
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
OF A WINE CONNOISSEUR YOU ARE,

20:45.810 --> 20:49.371
MR. SPENCER, BUT I THINK
YOU WILL FIND THE DUMONT

20:49.410 --> 20:51.640
BOTH NUTTY AND SHY.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.477
- VERY FAMILIAR.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.476
THAT WAS GUS ON THE FIRST DAY
OF KINDERGARTEN.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.509
- SHAWN.
- IT'S TRUE.

20:56.550 --> 20:57.517
YOU DIDN'T TALK TO ANYONE

20:57.550 --> 20:59.484
AND YOU PEED
IN YOUR CUBBYHOLE.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.851
I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY NUTTY,
WOULDN'T YOU?

21:00.890 --> 21:06.624
- OKAY, EXCUSE ME.
- I'M GOING TO JOIN HER.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.327
- [chuckles]
- NOT TOGETHER.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.367
- LOOK AT YOU.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.436
YOU'RE LIKE A SCARED CHICKEN
AT A SLAUGHTERHOUSE,

21:18.470 --> 21:20.301
AND I'VE JUST RATTLED
YOUR CAGE.

21:20.340 --> 21:21.932
- YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE CAGE.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.538
BUT I'M A RABID HAMSTER

21:23.580 --> 21:25.639
AND I'M JUST GETTING
STARTED, JACK.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.648
- HELLO, PROFESSOR.
- MR. MCKINLEY.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.341
I SEE YOU'RE WITH MISS AINSLEY
TONIGHT.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.984
- WHY, YES, I AM, SIR.
FIRST DATE.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.358
THINK YOU'VE DATED EVERYONE
IN THIS RESTAURANT.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.812
- [laughs]

21:36.860 --> 21:40.079
WELL, SIR, I LEARNED
FROM THE VERY BEST.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.428
BUT PERHAPS I'M NOT AS GOOD
AS MR. SPENCER.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.018
YOU'RE HERE
WITH MISS TUCKER?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.425
HMM. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
SHE WAS OFF LIMITS.

21:46.470 --> 21:47.892
- OFF LIMITS?
- WELL, YES.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.568
UH, EVERYONE WAS FAIR GAME
EXCEPT FOR HER.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.669
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PROFESSOR?

21:52.710 --> 21:54.928
I GUESS THAT MAKES YOU
A VERY BRAVE MAN, MR. SPENCER.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.868
- DOESN'T ANYONE USE
FIRST NAMES ANYMORE?

21:56.910 --> 21:58.377
- HEY, GOOD LUCK.
- YEAH.

21:58.410 --> 22:02.949
YEAH, WON'T BE NEEDING
ANY OF THAT.

22:02.980 --> 22:07.019
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH--
I DON'T--IT GOES--

22:07.050 --> 22:09.587
- WE MUST REMEMBER THIS WINE
WHEN WE GO TO PERU.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.429
- OH, YES, YES, YES.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.428
CLIVE IS TAKING ME ON A BUSINESS
TRIP TO SOUTH AMERICA.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.018
I'VE DECIDED TO INVEST IN ART.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.925
AND HE'S FOUND
A WONDERFUL PAINTER IN LIMA

22:16.960 --> 22:19.929
THAT HE THINKS I MIGHT
BE INTERESTED IN.

22:19.970 --> 22:22.438
- SHE WENT ON VACATION
WITH PRESCOTT TO SOUTH AMERICA.

22:22.470 --> 22:26.429
NEVER CAME BACK.
DIED IN A DROWNING ACCIDENT.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.370
- GILLIAN, IT'S A LITTLE STUFFY
IN HERE, DON'T YOU THINK?

22:28.410 --> 22:30.002
LITTLE BIT?

22:30.040 --> 22:31.541
WHY DON'T YOU SAY
THE FOUR OF US ROLL ON OUT,

22:31.580 --> 22:37.075
HIT SOME PLACE
A LITTLE LESS PRESCOTTY.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.712
- WELL, WHERE DID YOU HAVE
IN MIND?

22:44.030 --> 22:46.419
- CREATES THE PERFECT
CRISSCROSS.

22:46.460 --> 22:49.520
THAT'S IT. SYMMETRY.
SYMMETRY.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.994
ALLOWING ALL THE TOPPINGS
TO SNUGGLE UP

22:52.030 --> 22:54.863
AND GET WARM
UNDER A BLANKET OF CHEESE.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.095
AND BITE.

22:57.140 --> 22:59.165
- MM-MM.
- MM.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.178
- MM.
- MM'S RIGHT.

23:01.210 --> 23:04.771
- MM.
- MM-HMM.

23:04.810 --> 23:07.142
- OKAY, THIS MAKES NO SENSE.
HOW COULD SHE NOT BE INTO ME?

23:07.180 --> 23:09.068
- WHY DO YOU CARE?
- I DIDN'T, BUT NOW I DO.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.815
NO ONE OVER THE AGE OF 32
SHUTS THIS DOWN.

23:10.850 --> 23:12.181
- WOULD YOU STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOUR EGO

23:12.220 --> 23:13.448
AND START THINKING
ABOUT THIS CASE?

23:13.490 --> 23:15.014
- MY EGO?

23:15.060 --> 23:18.484
- GILLIAN, I FOR ONE AM HAVING
A MARVELOUS TIME.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.090
- MM. ME TOO.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.826
- BUT I NEED TO ASK YOU
A TEENSY-WEENSY LITTLE FAVOR.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.963
ACTUALLY,
IT'S MORE LIKE THIS.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.558
- [chuckles]

23:27.600 --> 23:28.794
- FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS,

23:28.840 --> 23:31.502
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD
NOT SPEAK TO

23:31.540 --> 23:33.474
OR HANG OUT WITH PRESCOTT?

23:33.510 --> 23:35.569
AND ALSO MAYBE NOT GO
TO PERU WITH HIM EITHER?

23:35.610 --> 23:38.670
- SHAWN.
ARE YOU ALREADY JEALOUS?

23:38.710 --> 23:40.519
NOT SURE HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THAT.

23:40.550 --> 23:44.987
CLIVE IS JUST A FRIEND.
[chuckles]

23:45.020 --> 23:47.454
- YOU WANT TO TOUCH MY HEAD?

23:47.490 --> 23:52.553
WOMEN OF ALL AGES AND RACES
SAY IT HAS MAGICAL POWERS.

23:52.590 --> 23:54.854
- I'M GOOD.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.198
[knock on door]

23:57.230 --> 24:00.734
- LASSIE AND JULES.
WELL, WHAT A SURPRISE.

24:00.770 --> 24:03.603
ONE--GUS, I THOUGHT
YOU PUT A SOCK ON THE DOOR.

24:03.640 --> 24:09.101
ONE SECOND.

24:09.140 --> 24:11.199
- I KNOW YOUR TYPE.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.706
YOU DON'T LIKE
"THE TELEGRAPH."

24:12.750 --> 24:15.913
YOU LIKE YOUR MAN
TO SURPRISE YOU.

24:15.950 --> 24:18.510
I HEAR THAT.

24:18.550 --> 24:20.142
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING
IN OUR PERSONAL SPACE?

24:20.190 --> 24:22.556
- WE DON'T WANT TO RAIN
ON YOUR EARLY BIRD SPECIAL,

24:22.590 --> 24:25.525
BUT WE THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
YOU'RE DATING OUR PRIME SUSPECT.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.528
- THIS IS NOT A DATE.
COME ON.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.198
WE'RE WORKING.
THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION.

24:29.230 --> 24:31.061
- WE GET IT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD OUT THERE.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.260
NOT EVERYBODY
HAS AS MANY CHOICES.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.836
DON'T BE ASHAMED.

24:33.870 --> 24:35.235
- YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY THINK
THAT GUS AND I

24:35.270 --> 24:36.532
ARE INTERESTED IN THESE WOMEN?

24:36.570 --> 24:37.935
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

24:37.970 --> 24:39.198
WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE
A MURDER HERE.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.128
- OH.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.942
- EXCUSE ME.
- MM-HMM.

24:55.260 --> 24:58.286
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- YOU TELL ME.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.299
- OH. OH, THAT?
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

25:01.330 --> 25:03.298
- NO. WE GET IT.

25:03.330 --> 25:05.093
APPARENTLY
WHILE YOU AND SPENCER

25:05.130 --> 25:07.667
ARE EXPLORING YOUR DISTURBING
NEW FETISH FOR OLDER WOMEN,

25:07.700 --> 25:10.066
O'HARA AND I WERE DISCOVERING
WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT TUCKER.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.261
- GILLIAN HAD ACCESS
TO THE BOTTLE OF SCOTCH

25:12.310 --> 25:13.834
LANCE WAS GOING TO BE DRINKING
THAT NIGHT

25:13.880 --> 25:15.279
AND SHE MAY HAVE POISONED IT.

25:15.310 --> 25:18.108
- WAS HE DRINKING
A GABARDINE HIGHTAIL?

25:18.150 --> 25:21.813
PRESCOTT CREATED THAT DRINK.
IT'S IN HIS BOOK.

25:21.850 --> 25:24.011
- PRESCOTT TAUGHT LANCE
EVERYTHING.

25:24.050 --> 25:25.688
HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD ORDER.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.244
AND PRESCOTT COULD'VE EASILY
SPIKED THAT PUNCH.

25:27.290 --> 25:29.554
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

25:29.590 --> 25:30.955
GUS IS A LITTLE BUSY

25:30.990 --> 25:34.153
TRYING TO GET SOME SWEET NOOKIE
OFF HIS OLD AUNTIE.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.952
- FOR THE CASE.
- FOR THE CASE.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.060
- GOOD LUCK.
- GO GET 'EM, TIGER.

25:46.910 --> 25:49.299
YOU KNOW, GUS,
I CAN IMAGINE A WORLD

25:49.340 --> 25:51.740
WHERE I GET A LITTLE FRISKY
WITH GILLIAN TUCKER.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.247
I DON'T THINK I NEED
TO ROUND THE BASES.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.339
BUT, YOU KNOW,
SLIDE INTO SECOND SAFELY

25:55.380 --> 25:56.677
FEELS SUFFICIENT.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.245
- I GOT THE DOUBLE PULLBACK,
SHAWN.

25:59.290 --> 26:01.178
SHE REJECTED ME.
I MEAN, WHAT IS THAT?

26:01.220 --> 26:02.881
SHE SMELLED LIKE MOTHBALLS.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.582
- SOMETIMES YOU SMELL
LIKE STYROFOAM. I DIG IT.

26:05.630 --> 26:06.881
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
SHAWN?

26:06.930 --> 26:08.227
- I NEVER TOLD YOU THAT
BEFORE?

26:08.260 --> 26:13.061
BOTTOM LINE IS WE KEPT PRESCOTT
AWAY FROM GILLIAN.

26:13.100 --> 26:17.298
HE BACKED OFF.
MEANS WE WIN, RIGHT?

26:17.340 --> 26:20.059
AH. I DON'T FEEL RIGHT.

26:20.110 --> 26:21.737
I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT I THINK WE MAY HAVE GOTTEN

26:21.780 --> 26:23.133
SOME BAD PINEAPPLE
ON THAT PIZZA.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.647
HOW'S YOUR STOMACH?
- I'M FINE.

26:24.680 --> 26:30.038
- REALLY? AH.
MAYBE IT WASN'T PINEAPPLE.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.584
MAYBE SOMEBODY GOT TO MY WINE
AT THE RESTAURANT.

26:37.790 --> 26:41.749
OH!
GUS, I SEE A BRIGHT LIGHT.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.392
I THINK I SHOULD GO
TOWARDS IT.

26:43.430 --> 26:45.261
- OKAY, STOP PLAYING, SHAWN.
- I'M GOING.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.165
TAKE CARE
OF MY GREAT DANE LOTHAR.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.394
- YOU DON'T HAVE
A GREAT DANE, SHAWN.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.294
- GET A GREAT DANE!
NAME HIM LOTHAR!

26:50.340 --> 26:51.830
- OKAY,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:51.870 --> 26:54.236
- I WAS POISONED, BUDDY.
I'M SURE OF IT.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.236
BUT I KNOW WHO KILLED ME.

26:56.280 --> 27:00.341
REMEMBER, IT WAS PRESCOTT
WHO KILLED ME.

27:11.090 --> 27:13.081
[monitor beeping]

27:13.130 --> 27:16.054
- SHAWN, THE DOCTOR'S HERE
TO TALK TO YOU.

27:16.100 --> 27:19.695
- WELL, I'M SORRY, MR. SPENCER,
BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION.

27:19.730 --> 27:23.131
YOU WERE POISONED.
- OH, GOD, GUS, I KNEW IT.

27:23.170 --> 27:28.073
[peevish] I TOLD YOU.
I TOLD YOU I WAS POISONED.

27:28.110 --> 27:30.431
- SHAWN, I SLEPT
WITH STACEY WHITAKER

27:30.480 --> 27:32.300
WHEN WE WERE AT THE CABIN
SUMMER OF JUNIOR YEAR.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.773
I KNOW YOU HAD A CRUSH ON HER
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.687
- THERE'S ALSO NO QUESTION
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

27:39.350 --> 27:42.319
- WHEN I SAY SLEEP,
I MEAN LITERALLY SLEEP.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.386
I WAS SO TIRED THAT NIGHT.
I MEAN POOPED.

27:45.430 --> 27:48.399
SAWING LOGS. ZZZZZZZ.

27:48.430 --> 27:49.920
- YOU WERE BARELY POISONED.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.894
THERE WERE JUST TRACES
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

27:51.930 --> 27:55.366
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU MEAN I'M NOT GONNA DIE?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.129
- WELL, MAYBE FROM ALL
THE TAPIOCA PUDDING

27:57.170 --> 27:58.432
AND RAISINS IN YOUR STOMACH,

27:58.470 --> 28:00.028
BUT NOT FROM THE POISON.

28:00.070 --> 28:02.231
- THAT WAS MY TAPIOCA, SHAWN.
YOU SON OF A--

28:02.280 --> 28:04.908
- SHAWN, HOW ARE YOU?
- PAPA.

28:04.950 --> 28:09.944
DADDY, COME.
COME CLOSER. COME AND HUG ME.

28:09.980 --> 28:13.108
- SHAWN. SHAWN. LASSITER
IS INTERVIEWING GILLIAN

28:13.150 --> 28:14.458
AND PRESCOTT AT THE STATION.

28:14.490 --> 28:15.980
YOU SHOULD BE THERE.

28:16.020 --> 28:17.726
I VOUCHED FOR YOU.
DO NOT MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.183
- DAD, I WAS POISONED.
- I HEARD "BARELY."

28:20.230 --> 28:22.289
COME ON. GET YOUR PANTS ON.
LET'S GO.

28:22.330 --> 28:24.719
- WHAT ARE YOU DO--?
AAH!

28:24.770 --> 28:27.864
- WHERE WERE YOU AFTER YOU LEI-T
THE RESTAURANT LAST NIGHT?

28:27.900 --> 28:30.937
- DETECTIVE, HAVE YOU EVER READ
LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER?

28:30.970 --> 28:32.369
- LET'S STAY ON POINT,
MR. PRESCOTT.

28:32.410 --> 28:34.435
- SO YOU HAVEN'T READ IT?
- IN COLLEGE, YEAH.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.129
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

28:36.180 --> 28:38.501
- IT'S JUST THAT
WITH YOUR CORN SILK HAIR,

28:38.550 --> 28:40.939
YOU MIGHT'VE STEPPED
RIGHT OUT OF ITS PAGES.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.470
- WOW.

28:42.520 --> 28:46.411
- DO YOU, LIKE LADY CHATTERLEY,
FEEL TRAPPED EMOTIONALLY?

28:46.450 --> 28:51.149
LONGING? THE NEED--
THE DESIRE TO BE HELD?

28:51.190 --> 28:55.297
- OH, MY...THIS FLOWERY CRAP
ACTUALLY WORKS ON YOU?

28:55.330 --> 28:57.355
- IF YOU HAD READ THE BOOK,
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND, SHAWN.

28:57.400 --> 29:01.837
THIS MAN HAS ACTUAL INSIGHT
TO THE PSYCHE OF A WOMAN.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.758
- I SAW ALL
THE EMMANUELLE MOVIES

29:03.810 --> 29:05.801
INCLUDING THE ONE
WHERE SHE CHANGED RACES.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.172
I THINK I HAVE PLENTY OF INSIGHT
INTO THE FEMALE PSYCHE.

29:08.210 --> 29:11.373
THANK YOU. NOW WILL YOU ADMIT
THAT YOUR BOOK IS DATED

29:11.410 --> 29:12.775
AND THAT I HAVE MORE GAME
THAN YOU?

29:12.810 --> 29:14.346
- I WILL NOT.
- ALL RIGHT.

29:14.380 --> 29:16.416
WILL YOU ADMIT THAT YOU TRIED
TO MURDER ME LAST NIGHT

29:16.450 --> 29:17.815
BY POISONING MY PERSON?

29:17.850 --> 29:19.408
- I CERTAINLY WILL NOT.

29:19.450 --> 29:21.509
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS
THAT YOU WERE BARELY POISONED.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.324
- OKAY, WHY DO PEOPLE
KEEP QUALIFYING THAT?

29:24.360 --> 29:27.898
- MR. PRESCOTT,
YOU HAVE MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES.

29:27.930 --> 29:29.454
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.297
PICK UP YOUR ID WITH THE OFFICER
AT THE FRONT DESK.

29:31.330 --> 29:33.469
- WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
DID YOU COME IN HERE TO KID ME?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.161
- I HAD TO LET GILLIAN GO
AS WELL.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.838
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO HOLD EITHER ONE OF THEM.

29:36.870 --> 29:39.464
- HEY, DAD, GET IN HERE.
NO, MY OTHER FATHER.

29:39.510 --> 29:43.378
WOULD YOU PLEASE
COME IN HERE?

29:43.410 --> 29:45.469
LOOK, YOU HAVE BEEN ON MY SIDE
FROM THE BEGINNING.

29:45.510 --> 29:50.311
YOU CANNOT ALLOW THEM
TO RELEASE THIS GUY.

29:50.350 --> 29:52.944
- I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE,
DON'T I?

29:52.990 --> 29:55.982
YES.
YES, I REMEMBER YOU NOW.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.317
A GENTLEMEN NEVER FORGETS
A NAME.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.488
LET'S SEE. HENRY.
HENRY WILLIAM SPENCER.

30:00.530 --> 30:03.454
HE'S THE ONLY STUDENT
I EVER HAD TO KICK OUT.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.229
- YOU GOT KICKED OUT
OF HIS SEMINAR?

30:05.270 --> 30:08.296
- YOU DIDN'T KICK ME OUT.
YOU INVITED ME TO LEAVE.

30:08.340 --> 30:12.367
- READ BETWEEN THE LINES, SIR.

30:12.410 --> 30:15.868
- OH--OH, DAD, THIS IS GOO--
THIS IS TOO GOOD.

30:15.910 --> 30:17.309
THIS IS TOO RICH.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.205
NOT ONLY DID YOU TAKE
THE SEMINAR,

30:19.250 --> 30:21.343
YOU WERE INVITED TO LEAVE?
OH, MY GOD, DAD.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.473
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
- FOCUS, SHAWN.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.885
- ONE MORE.
CHANDLER BING STYLE.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.410
[as Chandler Bing]
OH, MY GOD!

30:26.450 --> 30:28.315
- LOOK, WE CAN STILL NAIL
THIS GUY.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.214
PRESCOTT WAS DATING
ANOTHER WOMAN.

30:30.260 --> 30:32.854
A HARRIETT, UH, FINESTATT.

30:32.890 --> 30:34.426
HE WAS SEEING HER
AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH.

30:34.460 --> 30:37.429
A MONTH LATER,
THE COMPANY GOES KAPUT.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.927
- GREAT. DAD, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE NEED.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.267
- SHAWN, I WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME SOME TIME

30:40.300 --> 30:41.938
TO SUBSTANTIATE ALL THIS.

30:41.970 --> 30:44.302
YOU ARE SO CLOSE.
IT'S ALL STARTING TO TAKE SHAPE.

30:44.340 --> 30:47.605
I WANT YOU TO START
TO THINK LIKE A DETECTIVE.

30:47.640 --> 30:52.270
WE SIT ON IT. GOT IT?
- GOT IT.

30:52.310 --> 30:55.939
- THE IDEA IS TO ATTACK
AND CONQUER.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.516
LOVE DOESN'T COME TO YOU.
YOU GO FIND IT.

30:57.550 --> 31:00.439
SLAY IT IF NECESSARY,
BUT GET IT AND BRING IT BACK.

31:00.490 --> 31:02.617
ANY QUESTIONS?
- I'VE GOT ONE.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.049
- OH, BROTHER. YES?

31:05.090 --> 31:06.557
- WHY IS THAT YOU WILL STOP
AT NOTHING

31:06.590 --> 31:09.354
TO STEAL WOMEN'S MONEY
AND ULTIMATELY MURDER THEM?

31:09.400 --> 31:11.595
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS AND UNTRUE.
- REALLY?

31:11.630 --> 31:15.396
WELL, THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULDN'T
MIND TALKING TO THE CLASS

31:15.440 --> 31:17.499
ABOUT THE DEATH
OF HARRIETT FIN ESTATT.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.360
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

31:19.410 --> 31:21.071
YOU WANT ME TO TALK
ABOUT HER CANCER?

31:21.110 --> 31:23.408
HOW I WAS AT HER BEDSIDE
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS?

31:23.440 --> 31:26.944
OR SHOULD I TELL YOU
ABOUT HOW HER UNGRATEFUL SONS

31:26.980 --> 31:28.675
TOOK ALL OF HER MONEY
AND DROVE HER BUSINESS

31:28.720 --> 31:30.039
INTO THE GROUND?

31:30.080 --> 31:32.389
- NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.012
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.948
BUT...
- UH-OH.

31:35.990 --> 31:38.481
- WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN
IN SOUTH AMERICA, HMM?

31:38.530 --> 31:40.122
THE ONE
WHO SUPPOSEDLY DROWNED.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.354
COME ON.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.459
- LORRAINE?
SHE WAS KILLED BY A STINGRAY.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.968
NOW UNLESS YOU'RE ACCUSING ME
OF HIRING A SEA CREATURE

31:46.000 --> 31:46.989
AS A HIT MAN...

31:47.030 --> 31:48.588
- OKAY, WELL, TELL ME THIS:

31:48.640 --> 31:51.461
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN A WOMAN
WHO'S MUCH OLDER THAN YOU

31:51.510 --> 31:53.137
SPURNS YOUR ADVANCES?

31:53.170 --> 31:54.569
- GUS, COME ON.
A LITTLE DECORUM.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.498
- WHAT? YOU JUST ACCUSED HIM
OF DEATH BY STINGRAY.

31:56.540 --> 32:00.499
- WELL, WHY WAS GILLIAN
OFF LIMITS THEN, HUH?

32:00.550 --> 32:02.279
WHY DON'T YOU PAINT US
THAT PICTURE?

32:02.320 --> 32:04.379
- YOU WANT A REAL PICTURE,
MR. SPENCER?

32:04.420 --> 32:05.944
- I DO WANT THE REAL PICTURE.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.514
SO DROP THE GENTLEMAN ACT
AND SAY SOMETHING REAL.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.484
WHY GILLIAN?
- BECAUSE--

32:09.520 --> 32:10.589
- BECAUSE WHAT?
- BECAUSE I--

32:10.620 --> 32:14.624
- BECAUSE WHAT?
- BECAUSE I LOVE HER!

32:14.660 --> 32:17.959
BECAUSE I LOVE HER,
ALL RIGHT?

32:18.000 --> 32:22.061
I AM A CAD AND A DECEIVER.

32:22.100 --> 32:26.059
AND I AM HOPELESSLY,
RIDICULOUSLY IN LOVE.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.678
"DEAR PRESCOTT,
I AM DEEPLY SORRY

32:40.720 --> 32:42.688
"THAT I ACCUSED YOU
OF TRYING TO KILL ME.

32:42.720 --> 32:46.087
"GOOD DAY.
I SAID GOOD DAY, SIR.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.291
SIGNED, SHOWN SPENCER."

32:48.330 --> 32:49.558
YOU MISSPELLED YOUR NAME.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.192
- I DID THAT ON PURPOSE.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.561
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.295
I WAS IN A HURRY
AND I DIDN'T HAVE SPELL CHECK.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.069
- YOU NEED SPELL CHECK
FOR YOUR OWN NAME?

32:56.100 --> 32:59.160
- GUS.
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

32:59.210 --> 33:01.178
- WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
MR. GUSTER,

33:01.210 --> 33:03.269
MY ADVICE IS JUST WORDS
ON A PAGE.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.278
"ATTACK AND CONQUER."
IT'S NONSENSE.

33:05.310 --> 33:07.005
IT DOESN'T WORK WITH A PERSON
OF ACTUAL SUBSTANCE

33:07.050 --> 33:09.314
LIKE GILLIAN.

33:09.350 --> 33:14.117
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
GENTLEMEN, I'M GOING TO PROPOSE.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.481
- OOH.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.283
EXCITING FOR YOU.
- NO, IT'S EXCITING FOR YOU.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.389
IT'S TERRIFYING FOR ME.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING.

33:20.430 --> 33:22.694
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING
EUGENIA FOR TEA.

33:22.730 --> 33:23.754
I'M HOPING HER FRIEND
CAN GIVE ME ADVICE

33:23.800 --> 33:25.392
ON HOW TO APPROACH HER.

33:25.430 --> 33:26.624
- WELL, HOPEFULLY SHE'S NOT
AS STINGY WITH HER ADVICE

33:26.670 --> 33:27.864
AS SHE IS WITH HER GUM.

33:27.900 --> 33:31.336
- OH, WELL, YOU HAVE TO TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT HER CIRCUMSTANCES.

33:31.370 --> 33:34.339
- WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?
- YOU DON'T KNOW?

33:34.380 --> 33:36.109
EUGENIA'S
PRACTICALLY PENNILESS.

33:36.140 --> 33:38.506
GILLIAN TAKES CARE OF HER.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.152
- MY FRIEND EUGENIA
WAS RECENTLY DISAPPOINTED

33:49.190 --> 33:50.418
BY A GENTLEMAN FRIEND

33:50.460 --> 33:51.381
AND SHE COULD USE
SOME COMPANY.

33:51.430 --> 33:56.527
- DUDE, GABE MCKINLEY
WAS DATING EUGENIA.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.221
HE BROKE UP WITH HER.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.259
- HE REALIZED EUGENIA
HAD NO MONEY.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.460
HE CHOSE THE WRONG WOMAN.

34:00.500 --> 34:01.489
- HIS BUDDY SCORED
THE BIG FISH, GILLIAN.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.235
GABE WAS JEALOUS.

34:03.270 --> 34:06.159
- JEALOUS ENOUGH TO POISON HIM
TO GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.532
- JEALOUS ENOUGH
TO POISON ME.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.309
- SLIGHTLY. YES.
- SLI--?

34:11.350 --> 34:12.772
- WE BETTER CALL JULES
AND LASSIE.

34:17.650 --> 34:21.359
- WHERE'S GABE MCKINLEY?
WHERE IS HE?

34:31.430 --> 34:33.466
- ON THREE.

34:51.750 --> 34:55.413
- YES, I'LL HOLD.
- STOP.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.883
- THIS IS WHAT GABE
WAS DRINKING IN THE SAUNA.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.196
LOOKS LIKE WE MAY HAVE ANOTHER
POISONING ON OUR HANDS.

35:03.930 --> 35:06.490
- CUFFLINKS.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.762
WAIT A MINUTE.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.732
GABE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH GILLIAN

35:14.780 --> 35:16.668
AND THAT IS THE REASON
THAT HE IS DEAD.

35:16.710 --> 35:18.541
LANCE WAS DATING GILLIAN
AND THAT IS THE REASON

35:18.580 --> 35:19.842
THAT HE WAS POISONED.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.178
AND BECAUSE I WENT ON ONE DATE
WITH JILLIAN,

35:22.220 --> 35:25.246
SOMEONE TRIED
TO BARELY POISON ME.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.680
NOW I'M SAYING IT.
- THANK YOU. THAT WAS THE LAB.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.608
THE TOXICOLOGY REPORTS
ARE CONCLUSIVE.

35:30.660 --> 35:31.888
THE PRINCIPAL TOXIN
FOUND IN THE POISON

35:31.930 --> 35:34.296
THAT LANCE INGESTED
IS CALLED NAPHTHALENE.

35:34.330 --> 35:35.524
- NAPHTHALEN E?
- NAPHTHALENE.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.754
- WHAT-PHTHALENE?
- NAPHTHALENE.

35:36.800 --> 35:37.550
- NAPHTHALEN E?

35:37.600 --> 35:39.329
- DOES THIS MEAN ANYTHING
TO YOU?

35:39.370 --> 35:40.860
- IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.
MOTHBALLS, SHAWN.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.458
EUGENIA SMELLED
LIKE MOTHBALLS.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.832
BUT IT WASN'T HER.
IT WAS THE GARDEN.

35:44.870 --> 35:46.838
THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN MOTHBALLS
IS NAPHTHALENE.

35:46.870 --> 35:48.428
- NAPHTHALENE?
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.936
SHE USED THEM
AS A PESTICIDE,

35:49.980 --> 35:52.198
BUT THEY BECOME HIGHLY LETHAL
IF THEY'RE INGESTED.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.317
IT'S THE PERFECT OLD PERSON'S
MURDER WEAPON.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.952
THE MOTHBALL.
- OF COURSE IT WAS HER.

36:02.990 --> 36:04.787
THAT'S WHAT SHE USED
TO POISON GABE'S ENERGY DRINK

36:04.830 --> 36:05.888
AND LANCE'S SCOTCH.

36:05.930 --> 36:06.885
- LASSIE, YOU CAN SEND ME

36:06.930 --> 36:08.659
A THANK YOU NOTE LATER.

36:08.700 --> 36:09.928
- WELL, TECHNICALLY,
YOU HAVE SEVEN DAYS.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.825
- YEAH OR YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY
TO DO IT SOONER.

36:11.870 --> 36:12.962
- YOU REALLY SHOULD.
- WE NEED TO FIND EUGENIA.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.433
WHERE IS SHE?
- WITH PRESCOTT.

36:14.470 --> 36:15.630
- OH, NO.

36:15.670 --> 36:16.762
HE'S ABOUT TO DROP THE BOMB

36:16.800 --> 36:18.609
THAT HE'S GONNA PROPOSE
TO GILLIAN.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.664
IF WE DON'T GET THERE
IN TIME,

36:19.710 --> 36:20.836
HE'S VICTIM NUMBER THREE.

36:27.880 --> 36:32.681
[siren blares]

36:32.720 --> 36:34.859
[tires screeching]

36:34.890 --> 36:37.859
- CRIPE'S SAKE.
[honks horn] COME ON!

36:37.890 --> 36:40.381
MOVE THOSE VEHICLES!

36:40.430 --> 36:42.955
[honking horn]
- LET'S GO!

36:43.000 --> 36:44.763
WE HAVE TO GET UP THERE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.222
- I'M AWARE OF THAT, O'HARA.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.225
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
SHOOT MY WAY

36:47.270 --> 36:48.692
UP THE HILL?
I WILL.

36:48.740 --> 36:49.798
- OR...
- SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:49.840 --> 36:51.364
SHAWN, GET BACK IN THE CAR!

36:51.410 --> 36:52.434
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE A SHORTCUT!

36:52.470 --> 36:53.903
WE'LL MEET YOU UP THERE!

36:53.940 --> 36:55.771
- MEET THEM UP THERE?
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR DAMN MIND?

36:55.810 --> 36:58.870
- OH, SCREW THIS.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.774
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:02.820 --> 37:05.846
CARLTON!
- COME ON.

37:05.890 --> 37:11.681
COME ON.
THERE WE GO, YOU...

37:11.730 --> 37:14.392
- GREAT.
- SON OF A...

37:14.430 --> 37:15.397
[horn honks]

37:15.430 --> 37:16.692
- SHOULDN'T A CASE

37:16.730 --> 37:17.799
WITH AN OLDER WOMAN
KILLING PEOPLE

37:17.830 --> 37:18.797
BE LESS ATHLETIC?

37:18.830 --> 37:20.366
- HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.799
THINK ABOUT THE CUCUMBER
FINGER SANDWICHES

37:21.840 --> 37:25.367
WAITING FOR US UP TOP.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.849
- OH, MAY I HELP YOU?
- WE NEED TO GET IN.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.973
- OF COURSE YOU DO.
DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION?

37:35.020 --> 37:37.739
I'M AFRAID I CANNOT SEAT YOU
WITHOUT A RESERVATION.

37:37.780 --> 37:40.681
HOWEVER, I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO RECOMMEND ANOTHER TEA SERVICE

37:40.720 --> 37:43.484
WHERE PERHAPS PINECONE CHIPS
ARE AN ACCEPTED PART

37:43.520 --> 37:45.659
OF THE DRESS CODE.

37:45.690 --> 37:47.453
- LASSIE, YOU DON'T HAVE
A RESERVATION.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.368
PRESCOTT!
DON'T DRINK THAT TEA!

38:01.340 --> 38:03.433
- GOOD LORD.
PLEASE CONTROL YOURSELF.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.801
THERE IS A LADY PRESENT.
- SHE IS NOT A LADY.

38:05.850 --> 38:09.775
SHE IS A MURDERESS.
AND A LESBIAN.

38:09.820 --> 38:12.084
WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, EUGENIA?

38:12.120 --> 38:13.644
THINK ABOUT IT.

38:13.690 --> 38:16.454
NO ONE STOOD TO LOSE MORE
THAN EUGENIA

38:16.490 --> 38:18.629
IF GILLIAN GOT SERIOUS
WITH SOMEBODY.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.752
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER.

38:19.790 --> 38:21.326
IT WAS ALWAYS
JUST THE TWO OF YOU.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.419
AND IN YOUR MIND,
IT ALWAYS WOULD BE.

38:23.460 --> 38:24.825
LASSITER WAS RIGHT.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.497
GILLIAN'S LATE HUSBAND WALTER

38:26.530 --> 38:28.532
DID DIE UNDER MYSTERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES.

38:28.570 --> 38:30.663
BUT NOT AT GILLIAN'S HANDS.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.429
AT YOURS.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.836
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, EUGENIA?

38:34.880 --> 38:37.098
- EUGENIA'S BEEN STAYING WITH ME
SINCE WALTER DIED.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.801
SHE DOESN'T LIKE
TO GO OUT MUCH.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.101
AND IT HASN'T WORKED OUT
WITH ANY OF THE MEN

38:40.150 --> 38:41.879
I'VE SET HER UP WITH.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.811
- POOR GUS HERE NEVER STOOD
A CHANCE, DID HE?

38:45.850 --> 38:48.353
YOU ONLY HAD EYES FOR GILLIAN.
- OF COURSE.

38:48.390 --> 38:49.812
NOW IT MAKES SENSE.

38:49.860 --> 38:50.884
THAT'S WHY SHE GAVE ME
THE PULLBACK.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.421
- SHE GAVE YOU THE PULLBACK?

38:52.460 --> 38:54.052
- NO ONE APPRECIATED HER
LIKE I DO.

38:54.090 --> 38:57.548
SHE ALWAYS CHOSE
THE WRONG MAN.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.728
I WANTED WHAT WAS BEST
FOR HER,

39:00.770 --> 39:02.863
AND TO MAKE SURE
SHE DIDN'T GET HURT.

39:02.900 --> 39:07.508
I WAS PROTECTING HER.
- BOO-HOO. STAND UP.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.007
- YOU BETTER CUFF HER
BEFORE SHE KILLS EVERYONE

39:09.040 --> 39:12.703
IN THIS RESTAURANT.

39:12.750 --> 39:13.808
- PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

39:13.850 --> 39:15.875
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT
GILLIAN AND I

39:15.920 --> 39:19.811
WOULD SPEND
OUR FINAL DAYS TOGETHER.

39:19.850 --> 39:23.889
- COME ON, LADY.
LET'S GO.

39:29.830 --> 39:30.990
- AS YOU KNOW, GENTLEMEN,

39:31.030 --> 39:32.019
I SHALL NOT BE TEACHING
THE CLASS

39:32.070 --> 39:33.389
FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS,

39:33.430 --> 39:34.465
AS I SHALL BE
ON MY HONEYMOON.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.967
[chuckles]

39:36.000 --> 39:37.888
YES. BUT I HAVE ARRANGED
DURING THAT TIME

39:37.940 --> 39:41.432
TO PRESENT YOU WITH THE WISDOM
OF SEVERAL GUEST SPEAKERS,

39:41.480 --> 39:44.404
THE FIRST OF WHICH IS A MAN
I'VE COME TO KNOW QUITE WELL

39:44.450 --> 39:45.678
OVER THE LAST WEEK.

39:45.710 --> 39:48.508
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

39:48.550 --> 39:51.417
I PRESENT TO YOU
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE

39:51.450 --> 39:55.011
AND TRUE GENTLEMAN,
SHAWN SPENCER.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.527
- YOU KNOW, MY BEST FRIEND
BURTON GUSTER

40:03.560 --> 40:04.891
SAID THAT WE COULD ALL AFFORD

40:04.930 --> 40:06.727
TO BE A LITTLE MORE GENTLEMANLY
IN LIFE.

40:06.770 --> 40:10.433
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE WAS DEAD WRONG ABOUT THAT.

40:10.470 --> 40:11.767
- WOW.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.664
- BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I CAN SEE.

40:13.710 --> 40:16.474
THE WAY I THINK IS THE RIGHT WAY
TO DO THINGS

40:16.510 --> 40:18.774
IS NOT THE ONLY WAY.

40:18.810 --> 40:20.846
- IT'S BARELY A WAY AT ALL.
- WELL, IT'S MY WAY.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.541
- IT'S NOT A REAL WAY.

40:22.580 --> 40:23.672
- IF IT'S THE WAY
I APPROACH SOMETHING,

40:23.720 --> 40:24.948
IT QUALIFIES AS A WAY.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.184
- BUT IT'S NOT
A VERY GOOD WAY.

40:26.220 --> 40:27.585
- CLIVE, I THINK
YOU SHOULD SETTLE DOWN.

40:27.620 --> 40:28.917
- ALL RIGHT.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.086
- WE CAN ALL AFFORD
TO GROW UP A BIT.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.951
EVEN ME.
- ESPECIALLY YOU.

40:31.990 --> 40:35.926
- TRUTH IS, I WANT TO CHANGE.
I NEED TO CHANGE.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.188
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

40:37.230 --> 40:41.098
- I WANT MY FATHER
ON HIS DEATHBED--

40:41.130 --> 40:43.735
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW--

40:43.770 --> 40:47.467
TO LOOK AT ME AND SAY
"THAT--THAT IS THE MAN

40:47.510 --> 40:48.829
THAT I RAISED."

40:48.880 --> 40:51.769
AND I WANT HIM TO BE POINTING
AT SOME OTHER GUY.

40:51.810 --> 40:53.175
BECAUSE THAT MEANS
THAT MAYBE--

40:53.210 --> 40:55.713
JUST MAYBE--I AM NOT
HIS BIOLOGICAL SON.

41:07.630 --> 41:10.690
- OH.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.633
HELLO. THANKS FOR TAKING
THE TIME TO SEE ME.

41:18.670 --> 41:21.639
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- OKAY. OKAY.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.901
IT'S NOT A HUGE DEAL.
I JUST NEED TO HEAR IT FROM YOU.

41:25.950 --> 41:28.578
YOU NOT BEING INTERESTED
IN ME,

41:28.620 --> 41:30.576
THAT'S SOLELY BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW,

41:30.620 --> 41:32.815
THAT YOU ARE, YOU KNOW.

41:32.850 --> 41:37.287
- IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN?
- YES. THAT.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.686
- YOU DO REALIZE I'M IN HERE

41:39.730 --> 41:43.257
BECAUSE I'M BEING CHARGED
WITH A TRIPLE HOMICIDE, RIGHT?

41:43.300 --> 41:45.860
- YES. I GET IT.
YOU'RE BUSY.

41:45.900 --> 41:48.095
I'M BUSY TOO.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.529
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S BEEN
BOTHERING ME

41:49.570 --> 41:51.231
BECAUSE YOU DATED THAT OTHER GUY
IN THE BEGINNING

41:51.270 --> 41:52.305
AT THE BENEFIT.

41:52.340 --> 41:56.879
- YES. BUT I KILLED HIM.

41:56.910 --> 41:58.969
- RIGHT. I HEAR THAT.

41:59.010 --> 42:04.073
- WOULD YOU HAVE FELT BETTER
IF I HAD TRIED TO KILL YOU TOO?

42:04.120 --> 42:05.747
- WELL...

42:05.790 --> 42:08.657
- YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD MEET
A NICE GIRL

42:08.690 --> 42:11.818
AND--AND FOCUS ON HER.

42:11.860 --> 42:15.591
AND NEVER EVER
COME BACK HERE.

42:21.000 --> 42:21.989
- OKAY.

42:54.230 --> 42:57.233
