00:00.900 --> 00:02.359
a banker guy called David Amelio.

00:02.439 --> 00:04.559
We tried to check-up
on him but he's a ghost.

00:06.105 --> 00:07.476
All those pictures of Section 20.

00:07.556 --> 00:09.688

who we are and what we're doing.

Move!

00:15.198 --> 00:16.674
I wish you could see what comes next.

00:16.754 --> 00:18.450
- That's our man.
- I know him.

00:18.530 --> 00:19.325

00:19.405 --> 00:22.285

we want Jane Lowry to get a hold of.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.062
I am confused, Tommy.

We give you job, pay you decent wage

02:12.928 --> 02:16.760
and yet still you see
fit to steal from me.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.170
Do you think I do not
keep track of my product?

02:20.250 --> 02:23.275
- I am so sorry for this.
- Hm.

02:24.097 --> 02:26.520
My mother passed away yesterday.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.572
She always taught me to
believe in actions over words.

02:31.388 --> 02:32.933
You say you are sorry...

02:33.833 --> 02:35.200
...then prove it.

02:36.596 --> 02:38.124
One finger.

02:38.204 --> 02:42.760
Show me how sorry you really are.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.211
Mr Borisovich.

02:45.562 --> 02:47.160
Sorry to disturb you.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.640
I need to use your facilities
a little longer, please.

Don't trip the alarms.

04:27.260 --> 04:28.969
That was not my fault.

what's going to happen to you?

04:32.041 --> 04:34.763

- Skinny, call off your men, now!
- They're not my men.

it could've happened to anyone.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.212
Yeah, but it just so happens
that it happened to you,

04:51.292 --> 04:52.816
- so you owe me a beer.
- No, no, no,

04:52.896 --> 04:54.320
the bet was triggering an alarm.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.613
A panic switch is a
completely different thing.

- Go on, back to blondie.
- That's Captain Blondie, come here.

way, you owe us a beer.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.407
Skinny, look where you are.

05:49.487 --> 05:51.787
This isn't the sort of
room a lawyer walks into.

05:53.635 --> 05:55.800
Still maintain it was
a panic switch but...

05:55.880 --> 05:57.954

over within the hour.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.280
Captain better crack him fast.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.795
You launder and transfer
money for a lot of bad people.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.860
There's a lot of secrets
on that laptop of yours

06:13.940 --> 06:17.206
and a lot of security agencies
who want to get their hands on you.

06:20.204 --> 06:25.325
All I need from you... is access
to Jane Lowry's account. That's it.

06:25.405 --> 06:29.161
So either you help me or...

I-I-I can go now, right?

07:00.716 --> 07:03.473
You knew exactly who you
were working for, Skinny.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.194
See you in 25 years.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.557
Sir, there's over a
million dollars in the

07:09.560 --> 07:11.085

07:11.165 --> 07:13.281
Shut it down. I want
her starved of funds.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.647
- That's her account frozen now, ma'am.
- Nice work, Johnson.

07:17.727 --> 07:18.683
Jensen.

07:18.763 --> 07:20.708
- Nice one, lad.
- Thanks, man.

07:20.788 --> 07:21.486
What're you doing?

07:21.566 --> 07:22.943
Can you trace where the money was going?

07:22.946 --> 07:23.406
Err...

07:23.486 --> 07:26.142
- It may lead us to Jane's location.
- Yes, yes, I can.

07:26.222 --> 07:29.321
So no cash, no resources. Lowry's gotta
start seeing the writing on the wall.

07:29.401 --> 07:32.179
You saw how hard she went to get Markov.
You don't do that and give up in a day.

07:32.259 --> 07:33.933
I'm not saying she's gonna give
up in a day. I'm just saying...

07:34.013 --> 07:37.750
Sorry, do you mind? This is quite
tricky. And the chatter is...

07:37.830 --> 07:40.960
I think Jensen just told the
two of you to shut the fuck up.

07:41.344 --> 07:42.211

07:46.264 --> 07:47.219
a common thread here.

07:47.299 --> 07:50.280
Lowry's payments were all
funnelled into shell companies.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.012
All of which are connected
to one person...

07:52.092 --> 07:55.572

07:57.335 --> 08:00.291
Milos Borisovich. Owns
a string of drug labs.

Everything from crystal meth
amphetamine to anabolic steroids.

largest Belarusian crime dynasty.

Do you know why we wash
the body, Alexander?

08:16.598 --> 08:20.601
It's to cleanse it of all worldly sin

08:20.681 --> 08:23.603
before it passes into the next life.

08:23.683 --> 08:27.117

needs that more than most.

08:59.926 --> 09:03.169
No, it was an impossible puzzle.

that could solve it.

- We are not to be disturbed.
- You have defaulted on your payment.

- Mr Borisovich wishes to see you.
- That can't be right.

09:27.057 --> 09:29.090
I need some time to look into this.

09:32.685 --> 09:35.562
Please. We made an agreement.

09:35.642 --> 09:38.955
You broke that agreement. I think
it would be better to talk, no?

10:02.154 --> 10:05.183
commemorating the life of my mother.

10:05.263 --> 10:07.333
But tonight... tonight I am lucky

10:07.413 --> 10:10.864
because a beautiful
woman has come to fuck me.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.997
That is what you are doing,
is it not? Fucking with me!

10:14.077 --> 10:16.395

10:16.475 --> 10:20.076
In this world only two things
matter... profit and loss.

10:20.156 --> 10:24.118
- Right now you are in the wrong column.
- I can get you the money.

10:24.198 --> 10:26.850
And I can pay you extra
for the inconvenience.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.849
How much "extra" are we talking?

10:32.850 --> 10:34.427
50,000.

10:34.507 --> 10:36.945
But I need to travel to meet someone.

10:37.025 --> 10:39.145
24 hours.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.820
You can go.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.460
But Markov stays.

10:43.812 --> 10:45.913
And if you do not return,

10:45.993 --> 10:49.801
then you lose everything
and we will have problem.

10:49.881 --> 10:52.099
- Yeah. I understand.
- Good.

10:53.124 --> 10:55.657
By combing through
Borisovich's acquisition list,

10:55.737 --> 10:58.875
I saw that five days ago he
ordered specialist lab equipment

10:58.955 --> 11:02.555
for his facility in
Turov, southern Belarus.

11:02.635 --> 11:04.330
That's where Lowry must be.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.972

involves kicking in some doors.

11:07.052 --> 11:09.332

overnight, hit them first thing.

11:16.610 --> 11:20.389

11:30.784 --> 11:32.964

- What?

11:33.044 --> 11:35.090
You really like getting
into character, don't you?

11:35.170 --> 11:37.192
I take pride in my work, McAllister.

11:37.272 --> 11:39.393
Is that how it was
back in Task Force 18?

talk about it sometime.

- Exterminators.
- Not very subtle.

- Contact!

to get the fuck outta here now!

out! Let's go, let's go!

Hey, Jensen, you wanna warn us
about a secret exit next time?!

14:10.416 --> 14:12.615
It wasn't marked on the plans.

14:12.695 --> 14:13.627
What about Lowry?

14:13.707 --> 14:16.503
No sign, she's gone. And
they've snatched Markov.

14:49.646 --> 14:51.646
Not sure about the hair.

14:53.722 --> 14:56.202
- Volkan.
- How much do you need?

14:58.504 --> 14:59.864
Quarter of a million.

15:01.138 --> 15:04.518
You have connections, you know
people who supported Omair, maybe...

15:04.598 --> 15:06.158
Omair is dead.

15:07.390 --> 15:11.726
I can give you a few men.
Some willing disciples, even.

15:12.318 --> 15:14.722
Money, weapons, things that matter...

15:17.944 --> 15:22.531
Omair believed in something
that was true and pure.

15:22.611 --> 15:27.687
But you, you crave that
power, that excitement.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.791
There was a sickness in you.

15:29.871 --> 15:33.218
- I loved him.
- As did I, Jane.

15:33.298 --> 15:35.428
But only one of us got him killed.

15:40.404 --> 15:42.876
I made a promise to him.

15:44.061 --> 15:47.372
We... made a promise to him.

15:49.875 --> 15:53.126
- Please!
- Like I said, a few men.

15:53.206 --> 15:54.886
That's all I can spare.

15:58.704 --> 16:01.337
Thank you so much for coming.
It's very good to see you.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.231
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:05.882 --> 16:10.522
These guests are here for our
family. Put your fucking phone away.

16:13.911 --> 16:16.391
I do not think it was
rival gang, Mr Borisovich.

16:16.471 --> 16:18.330
Then who the hell were they?

16:18.410 --> 16:19.965
The lab is destroyed.

16:20.045 --> 16:23.064
That's enough shit on
this day of all days.

16:23.144 --> 16:25.384
Someone is fucking with me.

16:25.464 --> 16:27.182
Every generation of
the Borisovich family

16:27.262 --> 16:30.384
keeps their assets listed in a ledger.

16:30.464 --> 16:33.238
So you think wherever he has
Markov we can find it in that?

16:33.318 --> 16:35.487
The ledger will lead
to Markov and Lowry.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.771
And you're sure about
sending Novin in alone?

16:37.851 --> 16:40.039
Her Russian's good, she'll blend in.

16:40.119 --> 16:42.205
There's gonna be representatives
from nearly every major

16:42.285 --> 16:44.590

there, if she gets caught...

16:44.670 --> 16:48.104
We are taking the risk.
It's not up for debate.

16:48.246 --> 16:50.824
OK, look, forgive me
for saying this but...

16:52.635 --> 16:54.550
I think it feels personal.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.864
I brought 20 back from the grave.

16:57.991 --> 17:01.230
We have lost Lowry and she stands
to gain access to the deadliest

17:01.310 --> 17:05.223
chemical weapon ever created.
Of course it's personal.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.040
We all have a stake in this.

Cheers, man.

17:35.370 --> 17:37.998
What? Planning on staying
and watching me change?

17:38.078 --> 17:40.431
No, no, I just wanna
go through the op again.

17:40.511 --> 17:41.839

17:41.919 --> 17:44.745
The ledger is either on
Borisovich or kept in a safe room.

17:44.825 --> 17:46.576
In which case you'll need
to find the access codes.

17:46.656 --> 17:48.077
Yes, William, I get it.

17:48.157 --> 17:51.877
Grab the little red book, try not
to die, get out of there and, uh...

17:52.578 --> 17:54.073
no comms.

17:54.153 --> 17:55.273
Can't risk it.

17:55.999 --> 17:57.919
I do have this for you.

18:00.881 --> 18:02.569
Really don't get my style, do you?

18:02.986 --> 18:04.630
It's just a tracker.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.229
So we can keep tabs on you.

18:10.544 --> 18:12.018
It's worth it, right?

18:15.841 --> 18:18.561
The shit we do,
collateral damage, the...

18:18.977 --> 18:21.088
It's necessary. Right?

rush hour, Novichok in hand.

vomiting seizures, major organs

18:39.624 --> 18:42.904
shutting down. Dead within minutes.
And it spreads, from one carriage

18:42.984 --> 18:45.103
to the next carriage
to the next carriage.

18:45.183 --> 18:49.019
Then by the time the train pulls
in to the next station there's

18:49.099 --> 18:50.979
not a single soul left alive.

18:54.544 --> 18:56.503
Would have taken a simple yes.

18:57.278 --> 18:59.518
Yes. It's worth it.

19:01.046 --> 19:02.505
We'll be close by.

You should. Makes it easier.

19:49.024 --> 19:52.147
But then, I don't think
you're here to fuck, no?

19:52.227 --> 19:55.621
You pay me to get you into
this party so you can fuck.

19:55.701 --> 19:58.002
You'll never make that
back in one night.

19:58.283 --> 20:00.577

20:00.657 --> 20:04.628

Morning, sunshine.

35:07.652 --> 35:08.932
Yeah.

35:14.047 --> 35:15.887
What happened to my husband?

35:17.839 --> 35:19.519
Keep trying to picture it.

35:21.571 --> 35:23.171
And you were there.

35:24.940 --> 35:27.429
So what were his last moments?

35:28.915 --> 35:29.599
Words...

35:29.679 --> 35:32.048
Your husband had 50 Stinger
missiles that he was arming

35:32.128 --> 35:34.473
terrorist groups with.

35:34.553 --> 35:35.673
The devastation that
would have caused...

35:35.753 --> 35:37.292
The devastation?

35:38.167 --> 35:41.327
Have you seen what a stray
drone strike does to a school...

35:41.532 --> 35:43.772
a hospital?

35:43.852 --> 35:45.332
I have.

35:49.590 --> 35:51.836
Idrisi killed General Farid.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.617
We gave chase. McAllister
tried to take him alive

35:54.697 --> 35:57.092
but there was a missile
strike coming, so...

35:57.632 --> 36:00.374
So we shot him. And he died.

36:00.454 --> 36:04.054
And the missile brought the
mountain down. He's gone.

36:04.134 --> 36:06.734
Let it go, you don't need to carry
on, you don't need to do this.

36:07.312 --> 36:09.622
No, we started this together.

36:11.110 --> 36:12.870
I want what he wanted.

36:12.982 --> 36:17.345
I want the West to experience what
my people go through every day.

36:18.251 --> 36:21.577
YOUR people? You're from
Warrington, for Christ's sake.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.498
I grew up in the same town as you.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.741
I guess she needs an
excuse to be a psycho.

36:27.390 --> 36:33.173
Of course. The lone wolf.
Doesn't play well with others.

36:34.441 --> 36:37.135
Have you told him about
your task force yet?

36:37.874 --> 36:40.524
- The whole story?
- All right.

36:40.604 --> 36:42.558
The one where he was
so desperate for glory

36:42.638 --> 36:45.086
he got his entire team killed.

36:47.837 --> 36:50.357
Wasn't like that. I
didn't have a choice.

36:50.437 --> 36:54.389
Although... we've only
got your word to go on.

36:54.954 --> 36:56.049
Fuck you.

36:57.248 --> 36:58.756
Fuck you, they were my friends.

36:58.853 --> 37:02.448
Yeah, and they got to find
out exactly what kind of man

37:02.528 --> 37:05.168
Sergeant Samuel Wyatt really is.

37:07.556 --> 37:09.716
So what you telling me?

37:09.796 --> 37:11.412
Wyatt's some kind of dick?

37:13.998 --> 37:15.638
Because that's big news.

37:15.718 --> 37:17.932
I've spent time with the
guy, I know he's a dick.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.392
I also know that he's solid.

37:25.802 --> 37:27.415
What about you though, Jane?

37:27.495 --> 37:31.375
You could have sat there all silent
but you're talking away. I know why.

37:32.114 --> 37:34.641
You've got nobody. You're lonely.

37:34.721 --> 37:36.103
You don't know me.

37:36.183 --> 37:39.196
I'm not mocking you.
All your money's gone.

37:39.276 --> 37:41.476
Your own people would
never back a woman.

37:41.556 --> 37:43.895
You still keep going and going.

37:45.212 --> 37:46.673
Takes guts.

37:50.372 --> 37:52.892
Do you know the last thing
my mother said to me was?

37:54.622 --> 37:56.302
"Don't get into trouble."

38:01.829 --> 38:03.629
Could never go back.

38:05.547 --> 38:07.147
Even if I wanted.

38:10.770 --> 38:12.730
Have you got some family back home?

38:16.540 --> 38:17.820
Yeah.

38:19.512 --> 38:21.250
Mum. Dad.

38:22.833 --> 38:24.594
Must worry about you.

38:25.405 --> 38:27.525
Mum says I should phone home more.

38:29.624 --> 38:31.502
"Do they not have
phones in Afghanistan?"

38:31.582 --> 38:33.382
"No, we blew them all up."

38:39.356 --> 38:42.356
(THEY LAUGH)

38:50.343 --> 38:52.063
I'll save them for last, then.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.984
(DOOR OPENS)

39:03.367 --> 39:08.607
Alexander, these are the two men
who stole your grandmother's body

39:08.687 --> 39:11.845
- and defiled it.
- Mr Borisovich, I do just have to ask.

39:11.925 --> 39:13.885
Was your mother a larger woman?

39:14.005 --> 39:16.822
If we had known that your mother was
so heavy, we would have stolen ano...

39:19.097 --> 39:22.086
Alexander. What do you say to them?

39:23.820 --> 39:24.946
Alexander!

39:25.921 --> 39:28.121
F... Fuck you!

39:28.287 --> 39:30.007
(HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE)

39:32.135 --> 39:35.015
I looked into what you told
me about your scientist.

39:35.094 --> 39:37.339
It's true, he's worth something.

39:37.452 --> 39:39.020
But it's been 20 years

39:39.100 --> 39:42.240
so he needs to show that
he still has the skills.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.013
- Can you make that happen?
- I can.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.020
Then we're back in business.

39:57.511 --> 40:02.396
My mother was a very hard woman
but she was right about one thing.

40:02.476 --> 40:04.433
I raised a weak child.

40:04.513 --> 40:08.729
Sasha, it is time for you to grow up.

40:10.515 --> 40:14.096
Choose a target. Pull the trigger.

40:14.176 --> 40:15.936
And become a man.

40:21.929 --> 40:24.405
(SHOUTING IN OWN LANGUAGE)

40:25.813 --> 40:27.072
On my signal.

40:29.375 --> 40:31.815
- In position.
- In position.

40:35.903 --> 40:36.903
(GUNFIRE)

40:40.940 --> 40:42.225
Moving.

40:42.305 --> 40:44.825
All right, kid, easy. Easy now, come on.

40:45.452 --> 40:46.576
Ten.

40:50.994 --> 40:52.532
Nine.

40:52.612 --> 40:54.755
- You can't make him do this.
- Eight.

40:57.249 --> 40:59.164
Kid, you don't have to do this.
You don't.

40:59.244 --> 41:00.065
Seven.

41:03.499 --> 41:05.583
- Six.
- You know what? Shoot me.

41:05.663 --> 41:06.929
That's fair.

41:07.009 --> 41:08.224
Actually, shoot him, he's an asshole.

41:08.304 --> 41:09.699
- Five.
- You stole the hearse.

41:09.779 --> 41:10.728
We needed a getaway vehicle.

41:10.808 --> 41:13.125
- Did we get away?
- Four.

41:15.841 --> 41:16.999
Three.

41:19.073 --> 41:20.285
Two.

41:22.059 --> 41:23.297
(GUNFIRE)

41:23.377 --> 41:25.099
Sasha...

41:25.179 --> 41:28.071
You are my boy and I love
you but this world is hard

41:28.151 --> 41:30.511
and I will not always be there.

41:40.167 --> 41:42.487
You have to be nicer to me.

42:02.899 --> 42:03.899
Moving!

42:08.579 --> 42:09.486
Moving!

42:12.316 --> 42:13.792
- Lowry?
- Gone.

42:17.422 --> 42:19.228
Nice moves, computer guy.

42:19.308 --> 42:20.809
Thanks.

42:20.889 --> 42:21.855
Move!

42:25.782 --> 42:27.025
Go, go, go!

42:27.499 --> 42:30.659
(COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING)

42:32.601 --> 42:33.569
Fuck.

42:35.238 --> 42:37.878
Phone! Give me phone.

42:54.552 --> 42:56.912
(PHONE BUZZES)

43:07.484 --> 43:08.619
Da?

43:08.886 --> 43:10.566
Yuri, it's me.

43:12.409 --> 43:16.473
- Mr Borisovich.
- I have some people I want dealt with.

43:18.117 --> 43:20.418
This is bad time.

43:20.498 --> 43:23.019
Yuri just finish his last job.

43:23.333 --> 43:25.173
Yuri retired now.

43:26.745 --> 43:28.300
I recommend someone else.

43:28.380 --> 43:31.254
I don't want someone
else, I want the best.

43:31.947 --> 43:37.114
It's important, Yuri. Four
kills. You will enjoy it.

43:37.194 --> 43:39.543
(HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE)

43:39.623 --> 43:41.348

(HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE)

43:51.083 --> 43:52.483
So...

43:54.364 --> 43:56.004
Yuri was wrong.

43:56.979 --> 43:59.322
You were not my last job.

43:59.789 --> 44:01.508
Not by long shot.

44:09.568 --> 44:11.648
Yuri must go to work.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.299
(PHONE BEEPS)

44:36.709 --> 44:40.071
I feel like Donovan would burn through
all of us just to take Lowry down.

44:40.151 --> 44:41.775
You said if it's not
purified it'll kill her.

44:41.855 --> 44:42.870
She's dying anyway.
