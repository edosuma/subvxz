I'm going to the city.

04:36.902 --> 04:40.315
Then you look
very urban.

04:40.406 --> 04:45.275
Good. Because I need
to make a positive impression.
I'm going to get someone.

Yeah, and whatever it is,

22:40.985 --> 22:43.101
you're gonna ruin it
for everyone.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.231
I'm not gonna let you.

Your gift is more than
seeing sound as color,

24:40.396 --> 24:42.011

EMMA: True ability.
Well, what is it?

24:45.401 --> 24:49.235
Your emotions
can become one
with the music.

24:50.907 --> 24:54.741
You can bring
people to you.
Like a siren's song.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.400
Siren?

24:57.038 --> 24:59.199
Just play,
and you'll see.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.919
Concentrate on him.

25:04.587 --> 25:07.579
Draw him to you.
Now's your chance.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.206
I can't thank you enough
for getting him in.

27:12.006 --> 27:15.373
If you ever want to help
more of us, there's a place
I'd like you to visit.

27:15.510 --> 27:18.217
We could use a doctor,
and a siren.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.560
This will help
get you there.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.440

I was alone in the world.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.377
I guess I'm just
a little scared.

the remains found
in the small plane crash

28:18.781 --> 28:21.614
are that of
New York Senator
Nathan Petrelli.

28:21.742 --> 28:25.576
The N TSB is promising
a complete and thorough
investigation into the crash.

28:26.122 --> 28:28.363
At this time,
investigators are
reporting that

28:28.457 --> 28:31.585
the senator was the pilot
and sole passenger
of the plane.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.838
You're getting weak.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.290
Otherwise you would have
forced my mouth shut.

28:38.426 --> 28:41.008
Don't tempt me, Barbie.

28:41.137 --> 28:44.880
I'm telling you
Samuel's up to something.

28:44.974 --> 28:46.760
He's lying to all of you.

28:46.851 --> 28:47.931
No.

28:49.437 --> 28:50.517
He's a good man.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.386
Why are you so sure?

28:52.481 --> 28:54.642
Because I'm good now.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.104
This place is
good for me.

28:57.695 --> 29:00.277
I haven't done
anything wrong
since I got here.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.480
Joseph set me straight.

29:03.326 --> 29:06.363
He showed me what was good
and true about my ability.

29:06.495 --> 29:07.621
Joseph?

29:09.665 --> 29:12.452
Is that who's
in that picture there,
next to Samuel?

29:13.961 --> 29:14.916
Yeah.

29:15.004 --> 29:16.665
Samuel's brother.

29:16.839 --> 29:20.047
He didn't want
to let me in at first.
Samuel convinced him.

29:20.176 --> 29:23.668
Lydia said that Samuel's
obsessed with making
the family bigger.

29:23.804 --> 29:27.171

Samuel's bringing in
all these people, huh?

This is my home now, Barbie.
Listen to me.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.261
I don't want to
destroy this place.

29:34.357 --> 29:36.814
But if Samuel's
bringing people
in for a reason,

29:36.901 --> 29:39.313
don't you think
that's gonna put
everyone in danger?

29:39.403 --> 29:40.813
CLAIRE: You know me.

29:40.905 --> 29:44.318

think I want to
destroy your home?

29:52.541 --> 29:54.042
She knows.

Thank you.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.093
Lydia?

30:06.514 --> 30:08.379
Claire, what are
you doing here?

30:08.516 --> 30:11.053
I just went into
Samuel's trailer.

30:11.185 --> 30:14.393
He has a map of the valley.
What is he planning?

30:15.356 --> 30:19.099
Lydia, you wanted me
to go in there for
a reason. Why?

30:20.111 --> 30:23.023
You know something
and you're not telling
me what it is.

30:23.114 --> 30:26.481
Samuel wasn't...
He wasn't always
in charge.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.988
Joseph, he was
our real father.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.946
He made this place a home.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.620
And I miss him.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.493
We all miss him.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.544
What happened to him?

30:49.265 --> 30:51.381
He killed him,
didn't he?

30:52.560 --> 30:57.554
He's lost his way, Claire.
lam scared for all of us.

30:58.649 --> 31:02.642
I woke up this morning
and lwasn't sure
about this place.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.770
But this place is special.

31:06.407 --> 31:08.773
For you and
for your daughter.

31:09.577 --> 31:11.067
Even Doyle. I...

31:12.580 --> 31:14.696
The only thing wrong
with it is Samuel.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.621
You have to help us.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.324
Please.

31:18.461 --> 31:22.625
You have to find someone
that can stop him.

No buried treasure
for you, Nancy Drew.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.150
What were you thinking?

31:42.276 --> 31:43.561
You told me to watch her.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.904
She's not a prisoner.
If she wants to go,
she can go.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.398
Not a prisoner?

31:47.490 --> 31:50.607
It sure feels that way
with Copy Boy over here.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.987
Don't you ever
get sick of him?

31:53.496 --> 31:55.703
Stay or go, Claire.
It's still your choice.

31:55.831 --> 31:59.494
I'll go.
After you tell me what
happened to Joseph.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.212
Eli, give us a minute.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.338
Did Lydia tell you?

32:10.721 --> 32:13.053
No. I asked her.
She wouldn't.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.389
It's true, isn't it?

32:16.560 --> 32:17.675
You killed him.

32:17.812 --> 32:19.052
I lost control.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.270
Like that is an excuse?

32:21.357 --> 32:23.643
He told the government
about us.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.648
You remember them,
don't you?
They lured him in.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.571
The very same people
that've been chasing us
for years.

who worked alongside
your father,

32:35.079 --> 32:36.910
the man who
imprisoned you, Claire.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.405
How do you think
your father
got the compass?

32:39.542 --> 32:42.579
This is not about
my father. Okay?

32:42.670 --> 32:44.331
This is about
what you did.

32:51.428 --> 32:53.510

32:53.597 --> 32:55.053
What I did was awful.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.845
But Joseph put us
all in danger.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.556
After years
of running free,

33:01.647 --> 33:03.308
I wasn't about
to let him get
away with that.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.264
I wasn't about to let him
take that away from us.

33:05.401 --> 33:07.733
So murder was the answer?

33:07.862 --> 33:13.107
You, of all people, should
understand how far a father
will go to protect his family.

33:13.951 --> 33:20.242
Hasn't your father lied,
cheated, even killed
to protect you?

out in that valley?

to go back to it.

And I'm not giving it back.

My brother, Nathan,
taught me a lot.

Taught me how
to ride a skateboard
when l was a kid.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.079
How to hook a marlin.

38:56.502 --> 39:00.245
Taught me how to
catch a baseball.

Those are all things

will teach his son.

didn't make it easy.

or he'd throw it wide

39:24.238 --> 39:26.354
I'd tell him
to throw it right at me,

"That's not how
it's gonna come at you
