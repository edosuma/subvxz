He is making a terrible
mistake -- and he knows it.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.430
I think she's lovely, Adam.

00:07.480 --> 00:10.710
- I'm going to be expelled.
- Your son desperately needs his dad.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.390
I'm about to get married.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.310
Before you are joined in
matrimony, I have to remind you

00:15.360 --> 00:19.120
of the solemn and binding character
of the vows you are about to make.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.790
.. wed.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.030
Adam? Adam?

00:24.080 --> 00:27.670
I'm sorry, I tuned out a wee
bit there. Where are we up to?

00:27.720 --> 00:31.310
I know declare you husband and
wife. You may kiss the bride.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.350
Is expecting me to move back to Singapore.

intention of living in Singapore!

03:07.880 --> 03:09.550
Look, we can make this work.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.190
Matt can visit us. We'll meet him halfway.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.390
Why come on our honeymoon if
you won't stay for the marriage?

03:15.440 --> 03:17.030
I just wanna be left on my own.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.790
Denial, anger,

bargaining, and depression?

- It's the five stages of grief, that,
and all before takeoff. - That's four.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.990
- What's the fifth?
- Acceptance.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.640
And if I know Angela, that's
gonna take quite a while.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.310
I accept that you have to put Matt first.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.060
Know her well, do ya?

03:42.200 --> 03:44.200
- Hiya.
- Hi.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.110
His exams are the most
important thing now,

03:49.160 --> 03:52.510
and if that means that you
have to stay, then fine.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.900
You mean you'll stay? With me?

03:55.960 --> 03:59.360
- In Manchester?
- For better or worse, eh?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.150
I knew there was a reason I picked you.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.940
I think you'll find that I picked you.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.240
Mmm...

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
Here he is, Dad.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.230
He's been a bit down this morning.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.080
He's been looking forward to you coming.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.240
Dad? Look who's here.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.910
- Pete. - Of course it's Pete.
Nobody else visits, they're all dead.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.190
And he only comes cos he gets paid.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.190
Seven quid an hour? I
don't think it's worth it.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.710
- So how are you, you miserable old sod?
- Miserable and old.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.750
- It'll come to you.
- I think it already has.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.150
Right then, I'll see
you at the weekend, Dad.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.440
When you talk to that worthless brother
of yours, remind him where I live.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.550
People say I should be
proud of him, eh, our Paul.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.590
University lecturer. Huh. Never visits.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.590
He's probably busy, Harry.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.830
Aye, too busy to spare a
few minutes for his dad.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.630
I don't know, maybe it's my fault?

05:16.680 --> 05:19.590
Didn't give him enough
hugs when he was young, eh?

05:19.640 --> 05:22.550
Huh. That's usually the
charge nowadays, isn't it, eh?

05:22.600 --> 05:26.000
- Well, if I gave my son a hug,
he'd probably run a mile. - Mmm.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.310
You promised you wouldn't say anything.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.830
I wasn't going to, but I could
not let your dad get married

05:35.880 --> 05:38.470
- not knowing how unhappy you are.
- Still got married.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.190
And we're not going back to Singapore.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.150
We have to find you a new school.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.990
You can try the twins' school. It's coed.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.550
- What do you need to get in?
- In my case, David's chequebook.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.750
- Huh. That's good though, eh?
- Yeah, of course.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.390
Right, I'll give them a call. But
the dope smoking's gotta stop.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.470
- Dope?
- Oh, I'm so sorry, weed.

05:56.520 --> 05:59.790
And you can stop dealing
nitrous oxide to your friends.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.910
They weren't my friends.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.430
- You'll forgive me, won't you, Matt?
- You should, son.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.790
It's only because she cares
so much she said something.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.510
Right, we're off.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.390
Oh, can't he stay?

06:12.440 --> 06:15.030
I don't suppose he'll start
school for at least a week.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.950
If you like, you can have Josh's room.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
- Stash of porn behind
the radiator. - Ellie.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.000
I think I'd like to stay.
Not for that reason.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.990
OK. OK.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.480
Thanks.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.070
Be good.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.190
- Bye, Matt.
- See you.

06:34.320 --> 06:38.350
I've got unused leave, but not
enough. We'll worry about that later.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.990
If it runs out, you can
always pull a sickie.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.870
- I'd like to do that, but I wouldn't get paid.
- Do you not enjoy your job?

06:44.920 --> 06:47.070
Well, I don't do it for the love of it.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.070
- Welcome drinks in the bar at six.
Help yourself to a goody bag. - Thanks.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.990
Oi! Oi, oi! One each. I saw that. Tsk.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.470
Welcome drinks in the bar at six.
Help yourself to a goody bag.

06:58.520 --> 07:03.470
I do get to meet new people, but
they all tend to be sales reps.

07:03.520 --> 07:08.230
Still, at least I like to socialise, which is
more than you can say for Pete at the minute.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.590
It's just a pity, they're
all a bit dull. Mind you,

07:11.640 --> 07:13.390
they probably say the same about me.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.470
Can you not pretend to be interesting?

07:15.520 --> 07:18.150
You know, they don't
have to know the truth.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.270
Oh, role play, like when
couples' marriages are flagging.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.460
Personally, I can't wait.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.430
David, time for a quick word?

07:33.480 --> 07:35.870
I'm meeting some people,
Roger. Already running late.

07:35.920 --> 07:40.030
- I hear you know Eddie Zubayr.
- Word does get about quickly.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.990
Well, if you will put it
about. By your age, David,

07:43.040 --> 07:45.950
many have become complacent,
they've lost their edge.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.630
But you, you have managed to
stay one step ahead of the pack,

07:48.680 --> 07:50.350
kept the youngsters at bay.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.030
But they are snapping
ever closer at your heels.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.480
Yes. Tenacious little bastards.

07:56.640 --> 08:00.710
Landing Eddie Zubayr would be quite
a coup for this firm. For you too.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.870
- Well, I've met him, but --
- Excellent.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.950
It should make your job a lot easier.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I've told the board they can
expect an announcement soon.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.390
You won't let me down, will you?

08:16.480 --> 08:21.270
- So two hours after breaking up,
you were in bed together? - Mmm.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.870
- And two hours after that.
- Make-up sex. The best kind.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.350
- You should try it.
- Any kind would be a bonus.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.670
Are you and Pete not, um...?

08:30.840 --> 08:33.390
Um, he's sort of lost the urge.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.630
That happens, some men at his age.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.230
- I've seen no evidence of that.
- Her words, not mine.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.270
I do try and keep him interested.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.789
You know, gee him up.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.790
He said he'd rather go to sleep,

08:52.840 --> 08:55.030
and I'm trying not to take it personally.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.080
Oh God.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.390
Hey.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.740
Hey.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.070
David, aren't you forgetting something?

09:08.120 --> 09:11.790
- Sorry, Pete, yeah. Thanks for the lift.
- No, no, wait. Wait.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.200
You need to pay.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.110
Oh, yes, of course.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.700
- Of course, sorry.
- It's, er...

09:20.920 --> 09:23.190
- 19 quid?
- I had to wait.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.760
Here. Keep the change.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.030
I'll need a receipt.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.080
A blank one'll do.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.550
- Is Robyn not with you?
- Oh. Hi.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.030
Er, no, no, she's got something on.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.020
Did you even ask her?

10:03.240 --> 10:06.240
I think I mentioned it. In passing.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.950
Karen, um, whilst we're on our
own, I've got this for you to sign.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.230
- It's a stat dec saying that you
were driving when I was speeding. - OK.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.830
- And you've seen the photos? - Yes.
- You definitely can't tell it's you?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.910
It's a shocking likeness,

10:21.960 --> 10:25.160
and even better, it's
from the rear-view camera.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.750
- Angela, welcome to
Manchester. - Cheers. - Cheers.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.510
- We are delighted that you're both
staying. - Five months. - Tops.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.830
Ah. Does that mean that we might
be seeing more of your father?

10:37.880 --> 10:40.910
- No self-interest in
that question. - No, no.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.830
No.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.110
- We had dinner with him last
night, actually. - Really?

10:46.160 --> 10:48.710
Think what I'd gain. The
experience of a different culture.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.110
- Manchester.
- There's culture here.

10:51.160 --> 10:55.310
- It's Britain's second city.
- First. London's full of bellends.

10:55.360 --> 10:59.200
- Sorry, not bellends.
Um, dickheads. No. - Wait.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.910
I want to be here with Adam, and
he needs to be here for his son.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.110
Children are important.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.870
If you don't give him
enough attention now,

11:08.920 --> 11:11.830
when he grows up he'll
do exactly what he wants

11:11.880 --> 11:14.310
without a thought for you.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.360
He'll do that anyway.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.510
I dare say I could find a reason to visit.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.120
- A business opportunity.
- Well, you could just come to see me.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.680
Sorry.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.750
If I can be of any help, here's my card.

11:39.920 --> 11:44.160
I think I may have been a bit harsh
on that Angela. She's all right.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.680
Hmm.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.920
It was nice of Adam to treat us. Eh?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.310
Pete...

11:55.360 --> 11:58.360
do you remember when
we used to play games?

11:59.400 --> 12:02.070
What like? Buckaroo?

12:02.120 --> 12:04.830
- Pictionary? - Eh?
- Oh, I hated Pictionary.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.520
No. You know, make-believe.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.150
The maid. Eh? You liked her.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.590
And do you remember the mill owner?

12:14.640 --> 12:16.550
I do.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.030
And it felt faintly ridiculous even then.

12:19.080 --> 12:23.910
Well, look, I'm not saying it needs
to be about, you know, the sex,

12:23.960 --> 12:26.280
it's just a bit of fun.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.080
- Hey, OK, follow that car!
- What? Why? Why?

12:33.580 --> 12:37.760
I don't know. Just to see where
the driver's going. Come on.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.820
Home to bed, I would imagine.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.260
Which is exactly where I'm headed.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.640
OK.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.470
Dad, it's not that easy to fit
in. You have to have a group.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.310
- You know, meatheads,
cool kids, Goths. - Still?

13:03.360 --> 13:06.670
Most kids know which group
they belong to. I never have.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.230
- I mean, I'm quite good at sport.
- My genes.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.750
- But then I do well in exams too.
- Your mother's.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.790
And there's no way I want to be a nerd.

13:13.840 --> 13:18.630
- No, who would? Not even the nerds. - Most of
them aren't aware, that's what marks them out.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.150
- Can you not be between
groups? A floater? - A misfit.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.110
No, an individual who's above such things.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.030
It's a long time since you were at school.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.710
When I was we didn't have
groups. We just had mates.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.030
Like Pete. He wasn't one of the cool kids.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.790
- That's the group I really
want to be in. - Oh, whoa.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.630
- Listen, you know what it takes?
Confidence, that's all. - Ohh.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.230
Being comfortable in your own skin.
You wanna work hard and do well?

13:43.280 --> 13:47.510
Do it, be proud. You wanna be in the first
15, play the lead in the school play, do it.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.910
- Don't let anyone tell you you can't.
- You can't,

13:49.960 --> 13:54.710
- because rehearsals always clash
with training. - OK, but my point
is, be the person you wanna be.

13:54.760 --> 13:58.430
That's how people will see you. You
should try that in your new school.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.990
I'm telling you, girls love that shit.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.510
That's... That's if girls are your thing?

14:05.560 --> 14:08.560
It's easy if you know who
you are. Maybe that's it.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.830
- What?
- I don't know who I am.

14:11.880 --> 14:15.160
I'm just not... comfortable being me.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.150
Right. Well, I'll be your
point of contact 27/7

14:26.200 --> 14:28.590
- for any questions you may have.
- As it happens,

14:28.640 --> 14:31.910
- I do have a couple of questions --
- David, I have a phone call for you.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.560
Not now, Georgia, I'm with a client.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.200
What... Golden Goose?

14:41.080 --> 14:45.030
Um, I think that this is far
too important for a quick fix.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.070
So, I'm going to go away,

14:47.120 --> 14:52.430
and I am going to map out the best
strategy for you, going forward.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.150
- Well, my couple of queries --
- Whatever they are,

14:55.200 --> 14:58.910
I can promise you, you're gonna love
the answers. It's great to see you.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.400
- Georgia, will you show Mr Lamb
to reception? - It's Mr Kidd.

15:04.740 --> 15:07.390
Eddie, sorry to have kept you so long.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.230
One moment, Mr Marsden.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.230
We have to increase our stake. Nine
percent. Don't alert the markets.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.220
- I'll leave it with you.
- David Marston.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.910
Do you have a daughter, David?

15:19.960 --> 15:25.400
- Um, well, yes, I do. Actually two.
- Mine told me I had to ring you.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.630
Right. Look, I'll be brief.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.510
- I'd like to manage your investments
in this country. - It's Frankfurt.

15:32.560 --> 15:36.630
- .. the most highly regarded -- - David --
- international advisors in the North West,

15:36.680 --> 15:40.670
- and I am the firm's top performer --
- David -- - specialising in tax minimisation.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.670
- Avoidance, we don't call it that.
- Mr Marston,

15:43.720 --> 15:45.990
Mr Zubayr will be in Manchester next week

15:46.040 --> 15:51.270
- addressing a business forum
dinner. He would like to invite
you and a guest. - That's wonderful.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.310
May I speak to Mr Zubayr to thank him?

15:53.360 --> 15:55.900
I shall pass on your appreciation.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.800
OK, do you...

16:15.760 --> 16:17.430
Do you want to shower here,

16:17.480 --> 16:19.910
or do you want just get
your bag and go back to ours?

16:19.960 --> 16:22.670
I don't mind staying
on a couple more days.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.670
It's your honeymoon.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.710
Are you sure? As long
as Karen doesn't mind.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.390
She, er... She said it's fine.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.550
- How did it go?
- Yeah, good.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.830
- I thought I was gonna struggle, but
I managed to keep up, didn't I? - Yeah.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.550
I might do a second lap. What?

16:39.600 --> 16:41.990
Work up a sweat. Are you up for it?

16:42.040 --> 16:45.840
Yeah. No. About in a
month's time. Go. Goodbye.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.080
Look... Hah... Look. Never
again. I'm gonna be sick.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.630
- Do you think I need a new carpet?
- Well, it's seen better days.

16:57.680 --> 17:01.400
So have I. That's no reason
for getting shot of owt.

17:02.840 --> 17:07.040
1967, that's when we moved in here. Hmm.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.359
The carpet's a bit more recent.

17:11.079 --> 17:15.430
Ooh, I've been in our house 20 years.

17:15.480 --> 17:19.030
You must be close to paying
off your mortgage then?

17:19.079 --> 17:23.710
- I should be, but I had to borrow
against the house a few years ago. - Mmm.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.230
I never want to leave this place.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.950
Peter, will you do something for me?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.390
Well, if it involves a
happy ending, then no.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.790
- Finish me off?
- I said no.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.870
If they try to put me into a home.
It's what they want to do, my kids.

17:40.920 --> 17:45.270
They say it's in my best
interests. Suits them more like.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.390
- It'll kill me. - Well, I won't
have to do it then, will I?

17:48.440 --> 17:53.200
A slow, lingering death. Shitting
in a nappy, being fed with a spoon.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.420
Spare me that indignity, son.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.750
- Put me out of my misery.
- I can't do that, Harry.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.350
- Yes, you can. - No, I can't.
- Go on, say it. - I'm not doing it.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.310
- Say you will. Go on now, say it. - No.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.030
- Go on, say it!
- No!

18:07.080 --> 18:10.670
- Say it, go on!
- All right! All right.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.680
I'll kill you, if only to shut you up.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.030
Good lad.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.870
- Jenny, isn't it?
- Er, yeah.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.920
Coming for a drink?

18:28.760 --> 18:30.950
- Well, I was just off home.
- Just the one.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.880
It's on expenses.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.470
I can't miss it. I didn't
go to the last meeting.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.070
It's a book club, not
the UN Security Council.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.910
Robyn, please? Eddie's
invited me to bring a guest,

18:43.960 --> 18:46.750
and it would look rude if I
sat next to an empty chair.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.510
Ah, so it's just my bum
on a seat you want,

18:49.560 --> 18:52.070
- not my scintillating company?
- That would be a bonus.

18:52.120 --> 18:56.710
Take someone from the office,
or one of your friends. Pete.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.640
He looks like he'd appreciate a free feed.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.990
This is a full-time job for you?

19:06.040 --> 19:08.040
No. I also play poker.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.430
What, professionally?

19:11.480 --> 19:15.510
- I make a decent living.
- So why do this, then?

19:15.560 --> 19:19.590
- Well, what does a poker player
need more than anything? - Four aces.

19:19.640 --> 19:24.670
Well, yeah, good point, but no,
the ability to read people.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.190
You know, this helps me keep my hand in.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.550
For instance, I can tell you're married.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.870
- Well, wedding ring.
- But it's not your first marriage,

19:33.920 --> 19:37.510
- and you've recently had a baby.
- How do you know that?

19:37.560 --> 19:39.760
Registration form, please?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.310
People reveal more about
themselves than they realise.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.830
I'm having a drink with Sherlock.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.760
All right, Dad.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.110
- Hiya. So how did rehearsals go?
- It was all right.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.510
Spent about 20 minutes
learning a hard song,

20:01.560 --> 20:04.350
then two hours bickering
over what to call the band.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.150
- Most bands split up before they can agree.
- We're A Work In Progress.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.030
- So what are you called, then?
- That's it.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.870
- That's It?
- No. A Work In Progress.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.430
Oh. Hmm...

20:15.480 --> 20:16.830
- Shite, innit?
- Yeah.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.270
Actually, I quite like That's It.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.310
It's all right. It's a bit like Take That.

20:21.360 --> 20:24.350
Not that we're a middle-aged former
boy band of diminishing numbers,

20:24.400 --> 20:26.070
or can really sing, but...

20:26.120 --> 20:29.470
it's better. People think it's ironic.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.860
I'm going to ask the lads now.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.640
Er... Dad?

20:50.480 --> 20:54.160
- What are you doing?
- I'm just giving you a hug, son.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.440
♪ Let the desert wind

20:58.440 --> 21:01.750
♪ Cool your aching head...

21:01.800 --> 21:03.790
Mmm.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.180
That was in Seattle, I think.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.920
That's Christmas with his granddad.

21:11.320 --> 21:14.390
- Do you think he might be gay?
- Why?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.950
Something he said. Or
rather he didn't say.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.870
Look, I don't care,

21:18.920 --> 21:22.830
but I want him to feel
like he can tell me.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.150
We used to share everything.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.280
Not any more.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.560
Ant without Dec. It doesn't
bear thinking about.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.230
You'll get there.

21:41.280 --> 21:44.550

22:01.560 --> 22:04.560
Thanks for filling in
at such short notice.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.470
How's Robyn? Is she feeling any better?

22:08.520 --> 22:10.590
Still in bed. She'll be fine tomorrow.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.710
Just a touch of gastro.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.200
- I should call.
- No, no, no, she'll be sleeping.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.350
- She isn't ill. She doesn't
know I invited you. - What?

22:21.400 --> 22:24.470
- She didn't want to come. I had to
invite someone. - That's flattering.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.390
It was meant to be.

22:29.160 --> 22:32.710
- You're my first choice. - Madam?
- No, not for me, thank you.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.710
So, David, keeping secrets from your wife.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.760
If you will.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.200
Please?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.590
Karen's problem is she won't
put herself out there,

22:47.640 --> 22:50.910
and it's not like she's gonna
meet anyone through work.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.230
There are very few men in
publishing, well, that aren't gay.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.750
- She seems happy being on her own.
- Wait till the girls leave home.

22:57.800 --> 23:01.590
She'll be on the wrong side of 50
then. Oh, the dark side of the moon.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.230
No, she needs to get
herself in the game now

23:04.280 --> 23:07.910
while she still stands any
chance of success whatsoever.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.790
- I don't think she really wants to.
- I know she doesn't.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.310
That's why she needs her friends.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.960
Ooh, hello.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.270
End of the bar.

23:19.320 --> 23:22.760
Old picnic shirt. He's
all right, isn't he?

23:27.560 --> 23:29.560
Hello.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.750
- I can't just drop everything.
I'm working. - Oh, I know.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.230
- I need a cab right now.
- Why, where are you going?

23:37.280 --> 23:40.670
Nowhere. They're just driving me mad.
I'm paying you to come and drink.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.590
- Do I get extra to let you patronise
me as well? - That could be included.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.340
Are you having a bad day?

23:51.360 --> 23:53.630
Look, I've got a fare. I've got to go.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.680
Pete?

24:04.160 --> 24:08.270
Just a touch of gastro. When Karen
heard there was a spare ticket...

24:08.320 --> 24:11.390
Do you have a particular
interest in bilateral trade?

24:11.440 --> 24:13.430
More so since your talk.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.070
Excuse me, a quick photo.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.750
A bit closer together... Thank you.

24:17.800 --> 24:22.070
- David, how much do you know about football?
- I'm more of a rugger man.

24:22.120 --> 24:26.080
I'm thinking of investing in a team.
Have you been to Old Trafford?

24:27.080 --> 24:31.110
- You want to buy
Manchester United? - No,

24:31.160 --> 24:35.190
even if my pockets were deep enough.
No, I thought a smaller club,

24:35.240 --> 24:39.550
- once that I could take places.
- A Bournemouth, say. - Exactly.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.000
Before they became Bournemouth.

24:43.040 --> 24:46.990
Yes, very good. Yes, I could scout
around for prospects. Actually,

24:47.040 --> 24:50.710
my company has a box at Old Trafford,
if you'd like to come to a game?

24:50.760 --> 24:54.510
- Perhaps Karen can join us -- since
she knows her football? - No, no,

24:54.560 --> 24:58.680
- it's really not -- - She'd
love to. Absolutely. - Mr Zubayr?

25:02.640 --> 25:05.390
- Single?
- Er, yeah.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.910
- Straight?
- What is this?

25:07.960 --> 25:10.160
- How old are you?
- 42.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.790
- 51. - Hmm. Solvent? - I'm
a company director, actually.

25:14.840 --> 25:18.390
But still sitting on a bar stool on
your own, aren't you, love? OK, now,

25:18.440 --> 25:20.960
what do you think of her?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.150
- Very nice.
- Isn't she.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.480
OK, so... No, glasses off.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.400
Better. Smile.

25:33.640 --> 25:34.750
Gorgeous.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.590
What's Jen doing?

25:36.640 --> 25:40.600
- Asking that guy for his number.
- What?

25:43.680 --> 25:46.550
You will come to Old Trafford, won't you?

25:48.280 --> 25:51.880
- I think Eddie likes you.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.480
Oh, my God.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.560
Oh!

26:19.260 --> 26:22.460
- Is that your married man?
- How did you guess?

26:25.380 --> 26:26.520
Oh.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.610
- David?
- You know you were saying

26:30.660 --> 26:33.650
how you wanted to find something
special to do with Matt?

26:33.700 --> 26:37.850
- Sort of father-son bonding thing?
- I don't remember saying that bit.

26:37.900 --> 26:41.980
Well, how about watching the next
Manchester United home game...

26:43.020 --> 26:46.770
- from the comfort of a corporate box?
- Are you wise?

26:46.820 --> 26:50.090
- Great. - Yeah. I thought
I might get a stretch limo.

26:50.140 --> 26:53.730
Too much? Yeah, you're probably
right. We are gonna have such fun.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.050
And you remember the songs, eh? Uh?

26:56.100 --> 26:57.970
♪ We love United, we do!

26:58.020 --> 27:00.770
♪ We loved United, we do!

27:00.820 --> 27:04.210
♪ We love United, we do!
Oh, United, we love you!

27:04.260 --> 27:08.090
♪ 20 times, 20 times Man United... ♪

27:11.540 --> 27:13.410
Ah! I hate tunnels.

27:14.980 --> 27:17.730
You never told me about
your dinner the other night.

27:17.780 --> 27:20.410
- The business forum?
- Hmm. - Yeah, I did.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.930
No, you said I'd dodged a bullet.

27:22.980 --> 27:25.720
You didn't say whether Pete enjoyed it.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.980
I think he enjoyed the dessert.

27:32.020 --> 27:35.970
- Hey! I was just about to reach the next level.
- I just had Debbie Paignton on the phone.

27:36.020 --> 27:39.340
Suggested I might like to have
a look at the forum's website.

27:39.860 --> 27:42.400
Would you care to explain... this?

27:46.580 --> 27:48.930
You lying shit, David. Pete wasn't there.

27:48.980 --> 27:51.130
- You took your ex-wife.
- I can explain.

27:51.180 --> 27:55.660
- Who people might be forgiven for
thinking you were still married
to. - Why would they think that?

27:57.100 --> 28:00.900
"Eddie Zubayr with David
and Karen Marsden."

28:02.740 --> 28:04.450
She could be my sister.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.770
Agh! Robyn!

28:06.820 --> 28:09.730
How do you think it makes me
look? Like I'm the ex-wife!

28:09.780 --> 28:12.610
Which right now is quite
a tempting proposition.

28:12.660 --> 28:14.970
- Karen asked if she could come.
- What?

28:15.020 --> 28:16.730
Yeah, I was quite surprised too,

28:16.780 --> 28:19.690
but she's got the hots for
Eddie, and I think it's mutual.

28:19.740 --> 28:24.020
He insisted I invite her to Old
Trafford this weekend, the corporate box.

28:24.780 --> 28:26.780
You must come too.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.610
Ah, Pete, you should
have seen Matthew's face,

28:30.660 --> 28:35.050
- a corporate box, he was that made up.
- I'm absolutely delighted for you.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.890
You could at least pretend to be.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.930
Why? You've got everything, haven't you?

28:39.980 --> 28:43.010
A hot new wife, money to throw around.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.970
Life comes easy to you, doesn't it,

28:45.020 --> 28:47.290
while some of us, some
of us have to graft,

28:47.340 --> 28:50.650
and even then can't afford to
take our sons to Old Trafford.

28:50.700 --> 28:55.050
That's where you're wrong, Grumpy,
cos David's invited you and Adam.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.930
He said bring whoever you
want, the more the merrier.

28:57.980 --> 29:01.780
- They'll probably lose.
- Oh, you need a pint. Come on.

29:07.220 --> 29:10.100
Agh! Jesus.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.050
- Are you trying to kill me?
- I'm so sorry, Harry.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.300
- What are you doing out?
- I'm absconding, making a getaway.

29:17.340 --> 29:20.580
Unless you swap seats, you're
not gonna get very far, mate.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.050
- Oh, this is my mate
Adam. - Oh. Hello. - Hiya.

29:24.100 --> 29:27.490
- We're just going down the pub.
- Do you wanna come?

29:27.540 --> 29:30.850
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm supposed
to wait here. Go on, then.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.410
Go on, United fans together, eh?

29:33.460 --> 29:36.930
- I'm not dead yet, you know? - Sorry.
- Despite your pal's best efforts.

29:36.980 --> 29:42.770
- Dad, what's going on? - Oh, sorry,
it's our fault, we put him up to it.

29:42.820 --> 29:45.690
- And you are?
- This is my carer, Pete.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.330
And his friend Adam. And
we're going for a pint.

29:48.380 --> 29:52.330
- We're due there in ten minutes.
- I told you, I'm not interested.

29:52.380 --> 29:55.880
- Is this a care home?
- There's no harm in looking.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.380
Enjoy your drinks.

30:01.380 --> 30:04.420
- Can you believe it?
- What a gobshite. - I know.

30:09.980 --> 30:12.730
Football's not really my thing,
but corporate hospitality is.

30:12.780 --> 30:15.850
- Is this David's firm?
- Mmm. - He's invited me.

30:15.900 --> 30:19.810
- David has? - Mmm. - Are
you two, er...? - No.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.610
There's this businessman
who's got the hots for Mum.

30:22.660 --> 30:26.250
- She's meant to flirt with him.
- Dad's basically pimping her. - Ellie.

30:26.300 --> 30:30.250
It isn't my dad, is it? Oh,
my God, you don't fancy him?

30:30.300 --> 30:33.530
- No offence, but -- - She's
racist. - I'm not racist.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.050
He's a businessman, not my type.

30:36.100 --> 30:42.050
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh. OK,
well, maybe this bloke is.

30:42.100 --> 30:46.450
Wait. OK, he was in the bar the other night,
and we got talking. Well, I went up to him.

30:46.500 --> 30:49.370
Anyway, he's dead keen to meet you, Karen.

30:49.780 --> 30:53.010
Um, admittedly, a police mugshot
would be more flattering.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.930
The light was crap. But
you'd do him, wouldn't you?

30:55.980 --> 30:58.650
- No. OK, he had all his own teeth.
- Oh, right.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.890
And I'm meant to ring him
and say what exactly?

31:00.940 --> 31:03.010
"Hello. I hear you have
all your own teeth"?

31:03.060 --> 31:06.530
- Er, I wouldn't open with that.
- I'm not gonna open with anything.

31:06.580 --> 31:09.130
Honestly, Jen, I know you
meant well, but really?

31:09.180 --> 31:11.490
- It's as much my fault. - Yeah.
- What is it with couples?

31:11.540 --> 31:14.610
Why do you think no-one can be happy
unless you're part of the club?

31:14.660 --> 31:16.890
Sorry. I'm just trying to help.

31:16.940 --> 31:19.940
I'm just not interesting
in meeting anyone.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.580
I'd have done him.

31:26.060 --> 31:31.290
- "See, the thing is, it turns out
the corporate box is full." - David,
you said there'd be plenty of room.

31:31.340 --> 31:34.580
- "The more the merrier."
- Yes, well, ordinarily there is, but...

31:35.700 --> 31:40.210
The chairman got wind that Eddie's coming and
wants to come too, along with half the board,

31:40.260 --> 31:44.490
- so now I've only got three guests.
- OK. Me, Matthew and Ang.

31:44.540 --> 31:49.170
- No, Eddie, Karen and Robyn.
- But I've already promised Matthew.

31:49.220 --> 31:52.740
- He's been so looking forward to it.
- Adam, I'm so sorry.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.810
Now, I'll tell you what. Georgia?

31:58.020 --> 32:00.010
My PA will get some off the internet.

32:00.060 --> 32:02.660
It's my treat. How many do you want?

32:03.060 --> 32:07.300
- Six. - Six? - 'Uh-huh.'

32:07.820 --> 32:11.330
- Ah, no, it's fine.
- Thank you.

32:11.380 --> 32:13.380
Yeah, it's fine.

32:18.580 --> 32:20.810
Are you all right?

32:20.860 --> 32:24.850
I can't decide what to wear
tomorrow. 1968, first European Cup.

32:24.900 --> 32:28.660
1978, our centenary, or '99, the treble.

32:31.980 --> 32:33.980
Right.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.620
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Matthew Williams.

32:38.420 --> 32:41.220
Come up, get up here. Come on, son.

32:41.900 --> 32:45.970
- There you are, son, there.
- Photo. Let me take a photo. Say "cheese".

32:46.020 --> 32:47.730
- Cheese.
- United.

32:47.780 --> 32:50.330
- Well, put it on.
- No. - Oh, yeah, go on.

32:50.380 --> 32:53.050
- Come on, here.
- Go on, get it on.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.280
Ow!

32:56.300 --> 32:58.330
- Ah.
- Give it a twirl.

32:58.380 --> 33:00.780
Ah, come here to me.

33:01.460 --> 33:05.290
- Are you sure you're gonna be warm enough?
- Stop mithering.

33:05.340 --> 33:08.080
It's very good of you to take him out.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.170
(Er, Adam.)

33:12.700 --> 33:14.700
Well, go on, then.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.440
It's not an early kick-off, is it?

33:29.460 --> 33:31.460
Get the door, Adam.

33:52.020 --> 33:54.020
That's you.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.890
I'm sorry you're not in the box.

33:57.940 --> 34:00.090
It's better in the
stands anyway, you know?

34:00.140 --> 34:02.130
- The purer, like.
- Hang on, hang on.

34:02.180 --> 34:04.010
- Wait, wait, wait. - Come on. - Agh!

34:04.060 --> 34:06.530
Do you wanna try this? Try that.

34:06.860 --> 34:09.600
- What?
- Hold on, hold on. One more.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.489
- Uh?
- No, yours is the same.

34:12.540 --> 34:14.889
- What's going on? Huh?
- This is no good. - What?

34:14.940 --> 34:18.610
- No, these cost a fortune, pal. - Sorry,
lads, you've been had. - What? - Hey?

34:18.659 --> 34:22.179
Right team, wrong season.
They're for last year's game.

34:24.219 --> 34:25.489
David!

34:29.900 --> 34:32.040
Karen, lovely to see you.

34:32.980 --> 34:35.929
Say hello to Eddie. He's
been asking after you.

34:35.980 --> 34:39.010
I've come here to do you a
favour, not to be set up.

34:39.060 --> 34:41.130
- Eddie, hi. How are you?
- Very well. How are you?

34:41.179 --> 34:43.699
- Good.
- Thank you for coming.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.889
Oh, hello. I didn't see
your name on the list.

34:51.940 --> 34:54.980
No, I was passing. I thought
I'd pop in for a free coffee.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.000
Oh.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.340
There you go.

35:00.060 --> 35:02.490
- Played any poker lately?
- Eh?

35:02.540 --> 35:05.730
Oh, yeah, about that.

35:05.780 --> 35:09.250
I have a confession. I made it up.

35:09.300 --> 35:14.410
This is me. Sorry. Rubbish. Just
trying to make myself interesting.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.490
Well, that does make you interesting.

35:16.540 --> 35:20.860
I'm not really a sales
rep. I'm an undercover cop.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.930
Well, that's what I tell
myself when I check in,

35:26.980 --> 35:29.250
that it's all part of an investigation.

35:29.300 --> 35:32.610
So, are you working undercover today?

35:32.660 --> 35:36.140
Cos I might be free later
-- if you want backup?

35:43.680 --> 35:45.710
- How old are you, son?
- 15.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.030
- 18, you say?
- No. 15.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.080
I thought you said 18.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.910
- Here.
- Thanks.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.270
Hey, get us another one, will you, lad?

35:55.320 --> 35:57.390
- What, already?
- Aye.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.840
- You don't have to worry about
Matt having a good time. - What?

36:04.040 --> 36:06.040
Oh God!

36:09.960 --> 36:11.960
Do sit down.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.680
Thanks.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.910
I've got a ready sauna.

36:26.920 --> 36:31.880
"Jose Mourinho had to check on the fitness of
both Wayne Rooney and Zlatan Ibrahimovic..."

36:42.920 --> 36:45.670
".. he didn't like the judge.
.. he didn't like the decision."

36:45.720 --> 36:47.870
You're a wanker, referee!

36:47.920 --> 36:51.630
- "And here's Harry Kane in
the clear. Kane..." - Offside!

36:53.320 --> 36:57.950
If we funnel any investments through an
entity incorporated in the Dominican Republic,

36:58.000 --> 37:01.960
we can reduce the
effective tax rate to zero.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.590
".. very much in the balance..."

37:05.640 --> 37:09.440
Dad, can I tell you something
you might not like to hear?

37:09.800 --> 37:13.030
Is it that you're gay? If
it is that, that's fine.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.870
I don't have a problem with that.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.190
Your granddad's gay, or he's bisexual.

37:17.240 --> 37:20.310
He's with a woman right now,
but that could go either way.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.230
I mean, the point is, I'm cool with that.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.750
Is that what you were gonna say?

37:29.360 --> 37:33.070
- I find football a bit boring.
- What?

37:33.120 --> 37:36.750
Look... You just have
to go to a few games.

37:36.800 --> 37:40.510
- No, I don't want to. - No, son, I
thought that was gonna be our thing.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.390
You know, Saturday afternoon at Old
Trafford, fish supper on the way home

37:44.440 --> 37:46.710
then we can watch a replay of the match.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.870
Or, like, a family film like we used to.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.910
- I think the last time we did that,
we watched Finding Nemo. - Yeah.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.630
No, I mean I was, like, ten.

37:53.680 --> 37:57.470
- You still like films, don't you?
- Dad, it's not like it was.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.130
I've grown up.

38:00.480 --> 38:05.490
- You're 15, son. - Yes, I'm not a kid any
more. I'm really pleased you're staying.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.110
["The referee didn't hesitate."]

38:07.160 --> 38:09.510
I want to live with you and Angela,

38:09.560 --> 38:12.590
but I won't want to spend
all my time with you.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.750
You do understand that, Dad, don't you?

38:14.800 --> 38:18.000
".. drew the foul, stonewall penalty."

38:18.840 --> 38:21.310
- Well... - ".. this
could be the match here!"

38:21.360 --> 38:25.350
"It could be the whole title
race, and it's Wayne Rooney..."

38:25.400 --> 38:29.950
You don't like football, eh? I think
I'd prefer it if you came out.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.030
Well, there's still time.

38:32.080 --> 38:35.870
- "Rooney with the penalty. Two-nil!"
- I think you've scored.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.790
What?

38:37.840 --> 38:41.590
"Just into the top corner.
Lloris didn't have a prayer."

38:41.640 --> 38:45.150
"It's a great night to be a
Manchester United fan. Look at..."

38:45.200 --> 38:47.950
Tell me, Eddie, why do you
wanna own your own club?

38:48.000 --> 38:51.240
I own a canning factory. That
doesn't mean I like sardines.

38:52.520 --> 38:56.640
- For the prestige, I suppose.
- Which no amount of tinned fish could give you.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.310
You're not like most women I meet.

39:00.360 --> 39:03.310
They don't make me feel like
I have to do the running.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.360
I like that about you.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.110
Eh?

39:22.160 --> 39:24.900
That put a smile back on your face, eh?

39:25.280 --> 39:28.680
- Didn't it, big man, eh?
- Oh, give over, will ya.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.380
Harry? Oh, Jesus!

39:33.400 --> 39:35.960
Jesus, Adam, call an ambulance.

39:39.240 --> 39:42.320
- I'm so sorry, Harry.
- It's all right, mate.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.910
Takes me back to the old days,
when we used to play Millwall.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.390
- David, I'm going to slip away.
- Yes, of course. Does Eddie know?

39:58.440 --> 40:02.200
- David, no. I hope my being
here helped. - It did.

40:02.720 --> 40:07.280
- I think he's on the verge of giving us some
business. - Well, I'm very pleased for you.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.990
Don't let them on the internet all
night, and I should be back by ten.

40:21.040 --> 40:23.840
Well, 10:30, tops. OK.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.310
Hey.

40:28.360 --> 40:31.470
- Vodka and tonic.
- Oh. Should we be drinking on duty?

40:31.520 --> 40:34.060
We're undercover. Different rules.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.230
So here's the deal.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.680
See the guys on the next table?

40:41.320 --> 40:43.350
Big-time drug dealers.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.270
There's five ks of coke in that briefcase.

40:46.920 --> 40:49.150
Oh, it's exciting.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.400
- We're not to let them
out of our sight. - OK.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.390
OK, they're leaving, they're leaving.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.560
Playboys on the move. Repeat, on the move.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.080
Oh, right.

41:06.680 --> 41:09.950
- I hope Harry's going to
be all right. - God, yeah.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.150
And poor Pete. He took it hard.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.430
Yeah, you're not seeing him at his best.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.630
- You mean he's not always Eeyore?
- Well, he's never Tigger,

41:18.680 --> 41:21.310
but, I mean, lately he's
been so bloody miserable.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.600
He's always down, and...

41:28.120 --> 41:32.040
- That's it.
- What?

41:32.680 --> 41:34.680
He's depressed.

41:37.720 --> 41:41.430
♪ You move like a bird...

41:44.080 --> 41:47.070
♪ With a wounded wing

41:47.120 --> 41:49.720
♪ Wounded nerves... ♪

41:59.200 --> 42:01.200
(Come on.)

42:05.080 --> 42:08.080
(Oh. What are we gonna do?)

42:12.640 --> 42:16.670
- What are you doing?
- Well, I didn't want to blow our cover.

42:16.720 --> 42:19.240
Whoa. Hey, no, stop it.

42:19.840 --> 42:22.680
Oh. You've spoilt it now.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.670
There's someone here to see you.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.950
- Eddie. - I hope you don't
mind me calling unannounced.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.670
How did you get... Oh. David.

42:56.720 --> 43:00.910
You fled Old Trafford before I had a
chance to invite you out for dinner.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.510
I thought that might be your intention,

43:03.560 --> 43:07.560
so I thought, how might you persuade her?

43:08.160 --> 43:09.750
A private jet?

43:09.800 --> 43:12.400
Reservations at Le Marais in Paris?

43:14.080 --> 43:18.310
No. This woman is not so easily impressed.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.870
- Well... - She'd be just
as happy with a takeaway.

43:20.920 --> 43:23.750
That's what makes her so beguiling.

43:23.800 --> 43:28.680
Did you know Manchester has the
best baltis this side of Birmingham?

43:32.760 --> 43:38.680
I wonder then what you might
say... to a very hot Indian?

43:57.880 --> 43:59.950
Matt, Ellie, supper.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.310
Ellie, are you in there?

44:08.560 --> 44:10.190
Yep.

44:10.240 --> 44:13.640
- Ellie, have you seen Matt?
- Mum, don't come in.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.520
(Jesus.)

44:19.200 --> 44:20.840
Ah, shit.

44:32.800 --> 44:35.480
- Oh.
- Jen.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.200
Hey.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.480
Come here, come here.

45:09.880 --> 45:12.080
It's OK. It's gonna be OK.

45:16.760 --> 45:18.760
Promise.
