- Breathe! Breathe!
- I can't breathe!

00:03.271 --> 00:04.166
Push!

00:04.930 --> 00:06.671
Push! Push!

00:07.659 --> 00:09.754
Breathe. You need to breathe. Breathe!

00:09.779 --> 00:11.245
Push!

00:12.412 --> 00:14.907
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

00:14.932 --> 00:16.100
Oh, my God!

00:16.125 --> 00:17.485
- Minerva, What is it?!
- Something's wrong!

00:17.510 --> 00:18.555
What is it, Minerva?!

00:18.580 --> 00:20.109
Something's wrong.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.604
Aah!

01:11.883 --> 01:14.150
Right, but the barn burner award,
hands down,

01:14.175 --> 01:15.714
has to go to Syracuse/Wisconsin.

01:15.739 --> 01:17.414
- Did you see that game?
- Oh, yeah.

01:17.439 --> 01:19.687
No, no. I didn't see
any games this week.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.063
Well, what do you mean
you didn't see any games?

01:22.088 --> 01:23.401
There we go.

01:23.426 --> 01:24.893
Well, Brenda moved out.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.616
What?

01:26.853 --> 01:28.537
Can we just talk about sports?

01:28.562 --> 01:30.544
Oh, great.

01:30.569 --> 01:31.727
Let's talk about all the points
scored in this sports game.

01:31.752 --> 01:35.267
Wonder Woman. For the love of God.

01:44.301 --> 01:47.140
Talk about amateur hour.

01:53.564 --> 01:55.191
What do you want?

01:55.542 --> 01:57.210
You ran a stop sign.

01:57.346 --> 01:58.428
Giving you a ticket.

01:58.453 --> 01:59.517
No, you're not.

01:59.542 --> 02:02.147
They never gave the guy who was
the sheriff before me a ticket.

02:02.319 --> 02:05.122
Yeah, that's 'cause he, uh,
died while he was still sheriff,

02:05.155 --> 02:07.803
just like every other
sheriff of Willard's Mill.

02:08.077 --> 02:10.300
Except you. What are you doing?

02:10.431 --> 02:12.133
What's it look like I'm doing?

02:12.158 --> 02:13.961
I'm...

02:15.308 --> 02:17.467
I'm sugaring my coffee.

02:17.492 --> 02:20.562
What? Why didn't you do that
back at the doughnut shop?

02:20.587 --> 02:22.794
Are you insane? I was the sheriff.

02:22.819 --> 02:25.650
I can't... I can't let people
know I take my coffee sweet.

02:25.675 --> 02:27.818
They might think I'm a
little sweet if you...

02:27.881 --> 02:29.355
If you know what I'm saying.

02:29.721 --> 02:31.753
It's gay to sweeten coffee?

02:31.778 --> 02:34.428
Look, do you think John
Wayne took sugar? I don't.

02:34.453 --> 02:37.391
I think he took it black and acidy,
like drinking a battery.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.936
A-And for the record,
instead of picking on me,

02:39.961 --> 02:42.598
you ought to be focused on the
obvious criminals out here.

02:42.623 --> 02:43.923
Huh?

02:46.994 --> 02:49.156
They're not doing
anything illegal, Stan.

02:49.181 --> 02:50.163
You were.

02:50.188 --> 02:53.204
Yeah, look at them, all
dressed up in black.

02:53.327 --> 02:54.725
They're the new kind of hippie

02:54.750 --> 02:56.452
that dresses up like the Munsters.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.430
Relax, Stan. They're goth kids, 'Kay?

02:59.455 --> 03:00.807
They come from all over New England

03:00.831 --> 03:02.334
because of the witch trials.

03:02.359 --> 03:03.490
It's like Burning Man,

03:03.515 --> 03:06.960
except... you know...
they were burning women.

03:07.207 --> 03:08.606
For real.

03:08.631 --> 03:10.294
Good times.

03:13.706 --> 03:16.539
All righty.
Would you like to see a magic trick?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.054
It'll... It'll make you smarter.

03:18.079 --> 03:20.489
Alakazee, alakazam.

03:20.514 --> 03:22.212
Stan don't give a damn.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.446
That's not a magic trick.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.606
Yeah, you're getting smarter already.

03:34.897 --> 03:37.597
Think I got her hair in my coffee.

03:41.183 --> 03:43.219
_

03:43.656 --> 03:45.870
Here's the birthing suite.

03:54.205 --> 03:56.308
We are now on hallowed ground.

03:57.207 --> 04:00.460
It was here in this very
room that Minerva Garret,

04:00.485 --> 04:03.026
the most famous witch in
Willard's Mill history,

04:03.051 --> 04:05.131
drew her last breath!

04:05.156 --> 04:07.901
Praise goddess.

04:08.077 --> 04:10.270
I can feel her presence.

04:10.295 --> 04:12.812
And this weekend we
will absorb her power

04:12.837 --> 04:15.540
and give birth to dark
arts' most wicked.

04:15.565 --> 04:17.177
Most wicked.

04:17.202 --> 04:19.333
Hey, uh, speaking of dark arts,

04:19.358 --> 04:21.204
I got to share a trick with the toilet.

04:22.749 --> 04:25.005
Show me your toilet.

04:32.084 --> 04:33.519
There you go.

04:34.577 --> 04:36.065
Really, Stan?

04:36.089 --> 04:38.920
$64.99 in pennies.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.075
And it's all there.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.634
What's going on?

04:43.491 --> 04:44.901
I gave Stan a ticket.

04:44.935 --> 04:46.103
You can't do that!

04:46.135 --> 04:47.304
That's what I said.

04:47.436 --> 04:49.538
Evie, Stan's the former sheriff.

04:49.563 --> 04:51.876
I mean, first his wife dies,
then you steal his job,

04:51.901 --> 04:53.563
and now you start treating
him like a criminal?

04:53.588 --> 04:54.995
Exactly.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.990
The hell are you reading? Put that away.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.302
Hey. I didn't steal his job.

05:01.327 --> 05:03.363
He resigned! And I was appointed!

05:03.388 --> 05:06.758
Which gives me the power
to write tickets for $65,

05:06.783 --> 05:08.336
not $64.99.

05:08.831 --> 05:12.253
Oh, yeah? Well, you're
only getting $64.99.

05:12.278 --> 05:14.246
What are you gonna do,
take me to court for a penny?

05:15.955 --> 05:18.840
I dare ya.

05:21.817 --> 05:23.653
Just so you know,
I was gonna call you and say,

05:23.678 --> 05:25.434
"Hey, why don't we
forget about the ticket?"

05:25.459 --> 05:27.008
You know? But not now, buddy!

05:27.033 --> 05:30.303
You owe me that cent,
and I will see you in court!

05:30.328 --> 05:32.117
I'll die first.

05:34.870 --> 05:36.606
Perfect.

05:38.935 --> 05:39.904
What?

05:39.937 --> 05:41.263
The blood of a virgin.

05:41.288 --> 05:43.039
We can use it in our ceremony.

05:43.065 --> 05:44.928
How do we know she's a virgin?

05:45.007 --> 05:48.066
♪ Step on a crack,
gonna break your mother's back ♪

05:48.464 --> 05:49.428
Okay.

05:49.453 --> 05:51.540
♪ The ants go marching one by one ♪

05:51.565 --> 05:53.269
♪ The ants go marching one by one ♪

05:53.294 --> 05:54.387
♪ Hurrah, hurrah ♪

05:54.412 --> 05:55.991
- Excuse us.
- The...

05:56.089 --> 05:58.396
You want to go to a party?

05:59.689 --> 06:01.367
Okay.

06:10.851 --> 06:12.114
Will there be cake?

06:18.936 --> 06:21.794
Oh, boy, this is a great party.

06:21.911 --> 06:24.626
I am Craig, bringer of the dark veil.

06:26.535 --> 06:28.907
Minerva Garret, I beseech you.

06:29.076 --> 06:32.346
Pierce this mortal veil with your magic.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.819
With this knife, I will release my blood

06:36.844 --> 06:38.690
to free your life force.

06:40.921 --> 06:44.971
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

06:44.996 --> 06:47.207
Ow, ow, ow.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.591
What is that?

06:58.822 --> 07:01.559
Wait. Is this supposed to be happening?

07:07.641 --> 07:09.142
Oh, my God.

07:09.167 --> 07:12.654
Oh... my..God.

07:13.265 --> 07:14.832
Craig! Knock it off!

07:14.857 --> 07:16.335
God.

07:19.331 --> 07:20.530
Craig?

07:20.555 --> 07:23.091
O.M.G.

07:23.116 --> 07:25.101
Yes.

07:25.126 --> 07:27.045
Awesome!

07:27.070 --> 07:28.650
This was like the best magic show

07:28.675 --> 07:32.025
I have ever been to in my entire life!

07:32.050 --> 07:33.353
And that includes the one

07:33.378 --> 07:35.497
with the tigers and the two orange men.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.176
They have pizzazz.

07:39.089 --> 07:41.088
Craig!

07:41.576 --> 07:43.608
Hey! Knock it off!

07:44.602 --> 07:45.537
Hey!

07:54.541 --> 07:58.588
$64.99. Unbelievable.

08:01.170 --> 08:02.739
Hey. Are you the sheriff?

08:02.771 --> 08:04.106
Have you kids been in an accident?

08:04.139 --> 08:06.035
I think my boyfriend murdered someone.

08:06.060 --> 08:07.458
- He's not your boyfriend.
- Yes, he is.

08:07.483 --> 08:09.362
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

08:09.387 --> 08:11.728
Hey. Who are you talking about?

08:11.782 --> 08:14.517
Craig Wood, leader of our coven.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.332
Our coven.

08:16.357 --> 08:19.971
We are witches, and we formed
a coven to unite our power.

08:19.996 --> 08:21.597
Uh, it evolved.

08:21.622 --> 08:23.833
At first, we were really
just into roller coasters.

08:23.858 --> 08:25.961
We've done every roller coaster
on the eastern seaboard.

08:25.986 --> 08:28.540
Sky Devil. Daddy's Belt.
Doctor and Mrs. Hurricane.

08:28.565 --> 08:29.926
Okay, focus.

08:32.336 --> 08:33.909
Why are you in Willard's Mill?

08:33.934 --> 08:35.203
Minerva Garret.

08:36.145 --> 08:38.092
She died almost 100 years ago

08:38.118 --> 08:40.219
in what's now the bed-and-breakfast.

08:40.244 --> 08:42.210
That's where we're staying.

08:42.698 --> 08:44.687
That's where the murder was.

08:45.289 --> 08:48.522
She was a witch. Like a real witch.

08:48.547 --> 08:49.946
We're real witches.

08:50.065 --> 08:51.841
No, we're not.

09:00.502 --> 09:02.184
What is this?

09:02.781 --> 09:04.423
Water.

09:05.612 --> 09:09.369
Okay, uh, so this coven leader, Craig,

09:09.394 --> 09:11.191
um, who did he murder?

09:11.216 --> 09:14.898
A local virgin. Denise... something.

09:14.923 --> 09:16.650
Miller. Denise Miller.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.072
Denise Miller?

09:21.846 --> 09:23.433
Um...

09:26.202 --> 09:27.817
You guys stay right here.

09:27.842 --> 09:30.169
I need to, uh... I need to make a call.

09:32.939 --> 09:36.300
24 across. "Lawyer."

09:36.325 --> 09:38.295
It begins with an "A."

09:39.578 --> 09:41.674
"Asshole."

09:50.074 --> 09:51.726
Hi, sweetie.

09:51.948 --> 09:53.566
You been out all night?

09:53.591 --> 09:56.461
Hi, Dad.

10:02.495 --> 10:03.830
Uh-oh.

10:04.295 --> 10:06.289
Nothing says trouble
like a woman laughin'

10:06.314 --> 10:08.049
when shit ain't funny.

10:11.753 --> 10:13.918
Oh, shit.

10:37.453 --> 10:38.550
Yeah.

10:38.575 --> 10:42.910
Hey, uh, Stan. Is Denise with you?

10:46.881 --> 10:48.382
Yes and no.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.754
Craig?

10:56.779 --> 10:59.257
Who's Craig?

11:00.182 --> 11:02.751
Okay, uh, hey, sit tight, all right?

11:12.336 --> 11:14.033
Stabbed...

11:14.196 --> 11:16.032
by a gun.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.274
Charlene?

11:33.417 --> 11:36.627
I, uh... I could make
you something to eat?

11:39.291 --> 11:41.491
Hell, we have Fritos and relish.

11:43.252 --> 11:44.179
Hello?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.708
Yeah, we're in here.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.502
Hey.

11:49.533 --> 11:51.528
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

11:52.348 --> 11:54.580
Hello, constable.

11:55.267 --> 11:57.117
Who are you?

11:57.142 --> 11:59.143
Where is Denise Miller?!

11:59.738 --> 12:02.512
The daughter of the constable

12:02.537 --> 12:05.969
will return to the land of the living

12:05.994 --> 12:08.385
once all the constables

12:08.409 --> 12:11.575
enter the land of the dead.

12:12.716 --> 12:15.450
Oh. That's you.

12:15.850 --> 12:17.690
Are you Minerva Garret?

12:33.267 --> 12:36.915
Let me, uh...
Let me cut to the chase for you here.

12:41.076 --> 12:43.883
Have you ever been hit
with a bag of oranges?

12:44.405 --> 12:45.891
Huh?

12:47.785 --> 12:48.953
Stay tuned.

12:49.232 --> 12:51.270
Are you sure that...?

12:53.257 --> 12:54.741
Hey.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.842
Hey!

12:57.098 --> 12:58.739
No. Hey, hey!

12:59.008 --> 13:02.491
Did someone possess that,
uh, boy, t-this Craig kid?

13:03.035 --> 13:04.889
The constable.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.784
The constable or the witch?

13:06.809 --> 13:09.203
The constable is the witch.

13:09.893 --> 13:11.959
No, he burned the...

13:12.703 --> 13:14.372
Constable Eccles?

13:14.397 --> 13:16.523
Is the witch, the only witch.

13:16.548 --> 13:21.667
He burnt the innocent
souls to add to his coven.

13:23.331 --> 13:25.066
Here, uh...

13:26.927 --> 13:28.715
Here's how this is gonna work.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.330
Can I get a time-out real quick?

13:41.133 --> 13:43.824
I need to talk to you.

13:47.214 --> 13:49.718
Can I... Can I talk to
you for a second now?

13:49.743 --> 13:50.978
Sure.

13:56.278 --> 13:57.346
Where we going?

13:57.379 --> 13:58.643
Bed-and-breakfast.

13:58.668 --> 14:01.133
Oh, good. Keeping it weird.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.869
Super.

14:15.727 --> 14:17.289
Don't move!

14:17.314 --> 14:19.838
Ah! What happened to you?

14:19.889 --> 14:21.837
I-I thought...
I don't want you to know what I thought.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.182
W-Where did you go?

14:23.207 --> 14:25.390
Craig showed up and attacked Keanu.

14:25.641 --> 14:27.044
I ran.

14:28.385 --> 14:29.992
What are you doing?

14:30.016 --> 14:31.751
I'm leaving.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.223
He's possessed by Minerva Garret.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.415
He killed Keanu,
and he's gonna kill me next.

14:38.867 --> 14:40.635
And it's all my fault.

14:40.668 --> 14:42.495
I never should have messed with a witch.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.847
Minerva was not a witch, okay?

14:44.872 --> 14:47.462
The man who killed her was.

14:48.182 --> 14:52.704
Constable Eccles was the
only witch in Willard's Mill.

14:54.281 --> 14:56.271
He's the one who possessed your friend.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.824
My boyfriend.

14:58.178 --> 15:01.148
God, I just...
I don't have a dog in that fight.

15:20.858 --> 15:22.350
What are these?

15:22.375 --> 15:24.535
They're masks we wear
when we summon spirits.

15:24.963 --> 15:26.903
Minerva Garret.

15:27.129 --> 15:30.654
Do you think you could still summon her?

15:31.261 --> 15:32.951
Yes, I do.

15:32.980 --> 15:34.783
All right, gather those up.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.469
Where are we going?

15:36.494 --> 15:38.557
The scene of the crime.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.983
The original crime.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.357
Bu...

15:42.382 --> 15:45.421
Constable Eccle's crime.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.720
Let's go.

16:01.188 --> 16:02.669
We'll be right back.

16:02.693 --> 16:04.858
I'll, uh...
I'll leave the radio on for you, okay?

16:05.790 --> 16:07.509
Yeah. My thoughts exactly.

16:27.584 --> 16:29.106
This takes me back.

16:29.139 --> 16:30.239
I don't think I've been out here

16:30.264 --> 16:32.437
since I was almost burned
alive at the stake.

16:34.753 --> 16:37.079
The dirty secret of Willard's Mill.

16:37.256 --> 16:38.891
No wonder it's hidden.

16:39.591 --> 16:42.183
I wouldn't mind being buried back here.

16:42.276 --> 16:43.463
It's nice and quiet,

16:43.488 --> 16:44.964
a place you don't got
those jerks coming up

16:44.989 --> 16:47.209
every weekend with their snot-nosed kids

16:47.234 --> 16:49.841
getting their snot-nosed shit
all over the flower arrangements

16:49.866 --> 16:51.096
and popping balloons

16:51.121 --> 16:53.023
and doing all this shit
that... What's this?

16:53.048 --> 16:55.085
In our ceremony, we wear masks.

16:55.110 --> 16:57.886
Oh, no, I'm not... I'm not a voodoo guy.

16:58.301 --> 16:59.919
Just dance around the fire.

16:59.944 --> 17:01.704
Well, if I'm not a voodoo guy,

17:01.729 --> 17:04.118
I'm damn sure not gonna
dance around no fire.

17:04.144 --> 17:05.127
Stan.

17:05.152 --> 17:06.432
Please?

17:06.457 --> 17:08.969
Just dance in a circle
as hard as you can.

17:32.370 --> 17:36.319
Minerva Garret, I beseech you.

17:36.344 --> 17:40.059
Pierce this mortal veil with your magic.

17:40.084 --> 17:42.276
With this knife,

17:42.386 --> 17:46.128
I release my blood to
free your life force.

17:54.408 --> 17:58.553
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

18:07.119 --> 18:09.375
Charlene?

18:10.669 --> 18:13.540
Are you okay?

18:20.425 --> 18:22.791
Evie!

18:27.825 --> 18:30.696
Constable Eccles.

18:35.802 --> 18:37.603
Minerva Garret.

18:38.817 --> 18:40.326
You betray your master.

18:40.351 --> 18:42.152
I have no master.

18:42.943 --> 18:45.845
I will see your coven destroyed.

18:46.100 --> 18:49.469
These innocent souls will be relea...

18:51.982 --> 18:54.614
My coven grows larger every day.

18:55.151 --> 18:58.245
This boy, his friend...

18:58.658 --> 19:00.304
and now this girl.

19:00.329 --> 19:03.148
Harm these children no further.

19:03.439 --> 19:06.293
Oh, my dear Minerva.

19:07.764 --> 19:10.141
I would never harm these children.

19:10.166 --> 19:14.929
It's much more fun to
make them harm each other.

19:26.579 --> 19:28.415
Craig!

19:30.052 --> 19:32.055
Who's Craig?

19:36.738 --> 19:39.351
He was her boyfriend.

19:44.041 --> 19:46.255
She's free now.

19:49.469 --> 19:51.280
Everybody okay?

19:55.993 --> 19:58.566
Good thing I took that guy out.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.917
What?

20:38.954 --> 20:40.463
Hi!

20:40.970 --> 20:44.608
Hey, kiddo. Nice to have you back.

20:45.127 --> 20:47.301
Why am I tied up in the
back of the squad car?

20:47.326 --> 20:49.946
You want to tell her?
I'm, uh... I'm beat.

20:49.993 --> 20:52.243
Uh, can it wait?

20:52.268 --> 20:55.698
I just cut her boyfriend's
corpse's head off.

20:55.723 --> 20:59.025
Actually, he's not my boyfriend.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.526
Charlene!

21:00.551 --> 21:02.319
For Christ's sake.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.947
The hell is going on?

21:09.071 --> 21:10.607
Sweetie, just listen to the radio

21:10.632 --> 21:12.065
and enjoy the ride, will you?

21:12.090 --> 21:15.093
But there's something
you're not telling me.

21:17.146 --> 21:18.445
I don't think so.
