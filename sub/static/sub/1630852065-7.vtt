[sniffs] Ah.

01:31.173 --> 01:33.173
Still has that Chelsea smell.

01:34.131 --> 01:36.673
Do you have a taser and hot sauce?
I want to get Ed back.

01:37.006 --> 01:38.381
Wait. Is it your birthday?

01:38.465 --> 01:40.381
Nope. Adopt-a-versary.

01:40.465 --> 01:42.756
Chelsea gave me advanced gifts
for while I'm in space

01:42.840 --> 01:44.006
to celebrate the day we met.

01:44.090 --> 01:45.381
Year one:

01:45.465 --> 01:47.131
World's Best Boy.

01:47.215 --> 01:48.215
[giggles, gasps]

01:48.298 --> 01:50.215
Year two: Customized kaleidoscope!

01:52.465 --> 01:54.340
These are... different.

01:54.423 --> 01:58.381
Go ahead, give me the schpiel on how
gifts are just bribes to keep us obedient.

01:58.465 --> 02:00.548
I admit it. It's... cute.

02:00.631 --> 02:01.881
And based on the last two,

02:01.965 --> 02:03.965
I really want to see
what this year's gift is.

02:04.048 --> 02:05.215
Come on, open it.

02:07.631 --> 02:08.756
Is something wrong?

02:08.840 --> 02:11.965
She didn't think the mission would take
more than three years.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.381
This is my last gift.

02:13.465 --> 02:16.090
-[static over comm]
-[Nomi] Nomi to Captain.

02:16.173 --> 02:17.840

00 M-BARK

02:26.590 --> 02:28.173
Garbage is plotting something.

02:28.840 --> 02:33.006
Am I having déjà vu or did we have
this exact exchange last week?

02:33.256 --> 02:34.506
This time it's different!

02:34.590 --> 02:38.506
I overheard him and Kira talking
about how they're doubting our mission!

02:38.590 --> 02:42.631
Happy, I know you and Garbage
haven't exactly seen eye to eye.

02:42.715 --> 02:44.631
I... I mean, I'm taller than him.

02:44.715 --> 02:48.631
Even though Garbage can be reckless,
he's always been loyal.

02:48.798 --> 02:50.131
Do you have any evidence?

02:50.215 --> 02:53.215
Evidence? I don't need evidence.
I'm part of the counsel.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.506
I'm inherently trustworthy!

02:54.590 --> 02:58.381
I recommend you spend less time focusing
on what Garbage is doing wrong

02:58.465 --> 03:01.006
and more time trying to fetch us
a new planet.

03:01.090 --> 03:02.465
Here. Have a chew.

03:03.215 --> 03:04.840
This helps me de-stress.

[whimpers]

03:14.215 --> 03:15.215
Huh?

03:17.131 --> 03:20.465
Garbage to Loaf,
this planet seems a little... odd.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.340
Keep your ears and eyes on us.

03:22.423 --> 03:25.090
[whimpers] Copy that,
all ears and eyes on the mission.

03:25.173 --> 03:26.215
Please don't die.

03:26.881 --> 03:27.965
[whimpers]

03:28.965 --> 03:30.965
[gasps] Ah!

03:31.048 --> 03:32.840
Where are my Cheese-it chunks?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.673
There they are for some reason.

03:37.423 --> 03:38.715
Come on, Loaf.

03:38.798 --> 03:44.048
Get your snacks so old Happy can listen in
on the mission and get that "evidence."

03:44.131 --> 03:49.173
[grunts] But wait.
Garbage said not to leave my desk.

03:54.173 --> 03:56.298
[whirring]

03:58.631 --> 03:59.965
Ah!

04:14.090 --> 04:15.881
Did Earth beat us here?

04:15.965 --> 04:18.340
Ooh, that would be the ultimate prank.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.548
Well played, humans.

04:20.631 --> 04:24.423
Maybe it's some sort of parallel universe.
A wormhole or something.

04:24.881 --> 04:27.798
Uh, this planet seems a little

04:27.881 --> 04:31.006

04:34.215 --> 04:35.256

04:35.340 --> 04:38.340
I... uh, think we should leave.

04:38.423 --> 04:40.881
I don't know, Stella.
This place could be perfect!

04:40.965 --> 04:42.506
That's right, Garbage.

04:43.923 --> 04:45.173
It could be.

-Chelsea?

04:47.923 --> 04:50.215
Hey, boy! Welcome home.

04:53.090 --> 04:54.548
[automated voice]
Time to get your steps in!

04:54.631 --> 04:57.090
Only 9,500 to go.

04:57.173 --> 04:59.631
Well, it's time for my daily walk
around the M-Bark.

04:59.715 --> 05:02.340
[chuckling maliciously]
That's right, Loaf.

05:02.423 --> 05:04.715
Take your little walk away from your desk.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.006
What?

05:11.423 --> 05:15.048
[automated voice]
Great job! 9,495 steps to go.

05:15.673 --> 05:17.006
Oh. [growls]

05:19.590 --> 05:20.673
I don't understand.

05:20.756 --> 05:22.923

05:31.798 --> 05:35.465
[gasps] Andrew. Is that really you?

05:35.548 --> 05:38.090
[grunts] Look. Mr. Spaghetti!

05:38.173 --> 05:40.881

[growling]

05:47.923 --> 05:49.715
Please, we mean no harm.

05:49.798 --> 05:53.673
We are a peaceful race of Shapeshifters
known as the Shmoops.

05:53.756 --> 05:56.215
[giggling] "Shmoops."

05:56.548 --> 05:58.673
How do you know what our people look like?

05:58.756 --> 06:00.340
And what Earth looks like?

06:00.423 --> 06:03.173
We're Telepaths.
We can read your feelings.

06:03.256 --> 06:05.590
Your happy memories are like food to us.

06:05.673 --> 06:09.548
Oh, that's neat.
Got to find a way to monetize that.

06:09.631 --> 06:11.756
Your unconditional love for humans

06:11.840 --> 06:14.881
brought our dying species back
from the brink of extinction.

06:14.965 --> 06:16.548
Except this one.

06:16.631 --> 06:19.423
She's pushed her happy memories way down.

06:19.506 --> 06:22.465
-[growls]
-Wait. Extinction? You were dying?

06:22.548 --> 06:25.465
Yes, our tale is very similar to yours.

06:25.548 --> 06:28.673
We are half of a co-dependent pair
of species:

06:28.756 --> 06:30.965
The Shmoops and the Crumpulons.

06:31.048 --> 06:35.006
Coming together as one symbiotic race:
The Shmoopulons.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.381
[giggling] Shmoopulon!

06:38.506 --> 06:41.923
[Fake Andrew] We gave them happiness
and then we then we fed off it.

06:42.006 --> 06:43.465
At least, until...

06:43.548 --> 06:46.131
One day, without telling us why,

06:46.215 --> 06:48.006
we woke up to find they were gone.

06:48.090 --> 06:49.215
Leaving us alone.

06:49.298 --> 06:51.090
So, where did they go?

06:51.173 --> 06:52.256
We don't know.

06:52.340 --> 06:54.590
And since they left,
we've been wasting away.

06:54.673 --> 06:56.590
But your arrival revived us.

06:57.673 --> 07:00.631
What if we bring our humans here?

07:00.715 --> 07:03.215
More people means more happiness, right?

07:03.965 --> 07:07.548
According to your memories,
real humans are very hard to please.

07:07.673 --> 07:10.173
As soon as they get what they want,
they want the next thing.

07:10.256 --> 07:11.756
And then the next and then the next.

07:11.840 --> 07:16.631
But dogs! What you want is so specific,
so unwavering.

07:16.715 --> 07:17.756
All you want is us.

07:18.673 --> 07:19.923
And we want you.

07:27.756 --> 07:30.465
Let me see that screen.

07:33.381 --> 07:34.506
Ladybug, ladybug!

07:41.965 --> 07:44.381
Fake Chelsea seems
to be calling the shots.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.090
If she's anything like my Chelsea,

07:46.173 --> 07:48.590
I bet I can persuade her
to let humans come here.

07:48.673 --> 07:50.506
Captain, they're symbiotic.

07:51.881 --> 07:55.506
A biological relationship
with just two organisms. Not three!

07:55.590 --> 07:58.256
Well lots of great things work
in threes, Chonies.

07:58.340 --> 08:01.340
Tricycles, trilogies, bean dips.

08:01.423 --> 08:04.215
You guys stay here. I got this.

08:04.298 --> 08:06.215
Garbage, this doesn't feel right.

08:06.298 --> 08:07.881
They're hiding something from us.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.340
Well, only one way to be sure.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.965
There's several ways to be sure.

08:17.048 --> 08:19.590
-Ooh, gems. [laughs]
-Ed, no!

08:23.548 --> 08:24.756

08:32.631 --> 08:33.673
[yelps]

08:34.423 --> 08:37.340
I know what makes you happy.
Same as everyone.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.673
A comfy blanket!

08:39.756 --> 08:42.048
I slept on a bundle
of discarded reptilian skin

08:42.131 --> 08:43.256
for like 12 dog years.

08:43.340 --> 08:45.340
Blankets are too soft.

08:48.215 --> 08:49.548
My home!

08:50.840 --> 08:53.173
Except... Wasn't that tree on the left?

08:56.215 --> 08:59.173
And the front door
was actually made of bacon!

09:00.756 --> 09:03.965
[giggles] Come on in, boy.
And don't eat my door, okay?

09:04.756 --> 09:05.965
[groans]

09:07.631 --> 09:08.673
Mmm!

09:10.048 --> 09:11.090
[laughs maliciously]

09:11.173 --> 09:15.090
Let's see how well you cope
with ghost pepper powder, Loafy boy.

09:18.465 --> 09:19.590

09:33.048 --> 09:34.340
Huh?

[groans]

09:41.548 --> 09:42.756
Ready?

09:46.840 --> 09:49.090
This is exactly how I remember it!

09:49.965 --> 09:52.465
-Do you remember this?
-As well as you do.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.048
[gasps]

09:55.673 --> 09:58.006
Oh, I remember digging this up.

09:58.090 --> 10:00.381
[chuckles] All because you couldn't catch
that pesky squirrel.

10:00.465 --> 10:02.881
Oh, I could definitely catch him now.

10:04.798 --> 10:06.090
Oh, yeah?

10:07.840 --> 10:09.131
[barks]

10:09.215 --> 10:11.423

10:12.090 --> 10:13.381

10:30.631 --> 10:31.673
[FlungFlop] You're a dog.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.048
There must be a human you care about!

10:34.131 --> 10:35.131
Just give me a hint.

10:35.215 --> 10:38.006
Does the thing that brought you joy,
uh, have facial hair?

10:38.090 --> 10:39.381
No, she's...

10:40.381 --> 10:45.881
Only got the one huge mustache
that covers its entire face.

10:45.965 --> 10:47.090
[chuckles]

10:47.881 --> 10:49.048
And a unicorn horn.

10:51.006 --> 10:52.923
[giggles] Don't forget the dragon's tail!

10:54.423 --> 10:55.756
Oh, and a monocle.

10:57.048 --> 10:58.548
[giggling]

11:02.631 --> 11:03.631
Want to play?

11:03.715 --> 11:07.173
Oh, I'm not much of a frisbee player
these days, but, uh...

11:07.256 --> 11:08.756
Oh, what the heck! [chuckles]

11:11.131 --> 11:13.423
[grunting]

11:18.465 --> 11:19.798
[panting]

11:23.840 --> 11:25.590
I'll-I'll fetch it. Wait here.

11:25.673 --> 11:26.840
Stella, come back!

11:27.798 --> 11:29.090
[laughs gleefully]

11:33.673 --> 11:34.756

11:39.881 --> 11:42.673
-[panting]
-You'll get him next time.

11:43.215 --> 11:45.006
I haven't chased a squirrel in ages!

11:45.090 --> 11:46.381
-That was great!
-[groans softly]

11:46.465 --> 11:48.798
Well, if you stay,
we could do this more often.

11:48.881 --> 11:49.881
Would you like that?

11:49.965 --> 11:51.798
You know I would, but...

11:51.881 --> 11:56.131
If you really want to make us happy,
you'd let us get our owners and--

11:56.215 --> 11:57.840
Garbage, I'm sorry.

11:57.923 --> 12:00.548
Humans just can't be pleased
like dogs can.

12:00.631 --> 12:03.256
They'll always need more.
They'll never be satisfied.

12:03.340 --> 12:06.631
Chelsea didn't need more.
She just needed me.

12:06.715 --> 12:08.506
She was happy with me.

12:08.590 --> 12:11.590
If the human Chelsea was as happy
as you seem to think she was,

12:11.673 --> 12:13.423
she wouldn't have sent you away.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.465
It's... not that simple.

12:17.173 --> 12:19.465
Hey, maybe this will cheer you up.

12:21.881 --> 12:23.423
Happy adopt-a-versary!

12:25.090 --> 12:27.965
We can relive all these whenever you like.

12:28.131 --> 12:29.548
Create new memories, too.

12:30.381 --> 12:31.465
Stay.

12:31.548 --> 12:33.756
Get everything you miss back.

12:42.048 --> 12:44.881
Hmm, I haven't heard
from the Captain in a while.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.631
[softly] Probably because he's off
betraying the mission.

12:47.715 --> 12:50.298
Just got to get that intel.

12:50.381 --> 12:53.048
Loaf to Captain Garbage,
this is Loaf. Hello?

12:53.131 --> 12:54.548
Stella? Anyone?

12:54.631 --> 12:56.548
You're not dying, are you?

12:56.631 --> 13:00.006
Don't worry.
This tranquilizer should calm you down.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.756
Hey! A cheesy poof!

13:04.215 --> 13:05.923
I must have missed you earlier.

13:06.006 --> 13:07.215
[chewing audibly]

13:07.298 --> 13:08.548
[groans]

13:08.631 --> 13:10.756
Are you a Crumpulon?

13:10.840 --> 13:12.340
They said you left the planet.

13:12.423 --> 13:14.465
[languidly] Why would we leave?

13:14.548 --> 13:16.548
We're happy.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.173
[languidly] They make us happy.

13:19.256 --> 13:22.590
[languidly] We gave them all our happy

13:22.673 --> 13:25.590
until we had no happiness.

13:25.673 --> 13:26.798
[chanting] Happy.

13:26.881 --> 13:28.923
So you become nothing.

13:29.298 --> 13:31.381
-[gasp] We've got to get out of--
-[Fake Ellie] Stella!

13:32.631 --> 13:34.506
-[growls]
-Come back!

13:34.590 --> 13:37.756
[clicks tongue]
I'd say her arms were more pasta-ey.

13:41.048 --> 13:42.756
Everyone, get to the ship now!

13:43.173 --> 13:44.173
But--

13:44.256 --> 13:46.756
If you ever want to see
your real humans again, do as I say!

13:48.173 --> 13:50.673
-Okay, so later, fakey!
-[gasps]

13:50.756 --> 13:53.590
I'm gonna miss you so much!

13:54.798 --> 13:56.631
-[Kira] Come on guys, there's no time.
-Uh?

13:56.715 --> 13:58.173
-[Chonies] Thanks for the game!
-[gasps]

13:58.256 --> 13:59.881
And for the record, I let you win!

13:59.965 --> 14:01.631
-[panting]
-What's wrong?

14:01.715 --> 14:02.923
The Crumpulons never left.

14:03.048 --> 14:05.548
The Shmoops just sucked
all the happiness out of them.

14:05.631 --> 14:06.965
I knew it!

14:07.215 --> 14:08.548
Make sure the others get back.

14:08.631 --> 14:09.923
I'll go find Garbage.

14:12.631 --> 14:15.798
See? Isn't this nice? Just like old times.

14:15.881 --> 14:17.256
I love you, Garbage!

14:17.881 --> 14:20.381
[sniffing]

14:21.506 --> 14:23.173
What's wrong? Something's wrong.

14:23.256 --> 14:24.756
Is it my smell? It's a smell, isn't it?

14:24.840 --> 14:27.006
We can't replicate smells, okay?
We've got every other detail!

14:27.465 --> 14:29.423
Look, you've been great.

14:29.506 --> 14:32.298
The best Chelsea replica
a good boy could ask for.

14:32.381 --> 14:34.756
But I'd always know it's not real.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.465
We'd just be using each other.

14:36.548 --> 14:38.298
Chelsea's using you, too.

14:39.340 --> 14:41.590
Maybe. But my friends aren't.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.215
No, Garbage please. Don't go.

14:43.298 --> 14:44.506
Garbage, please!

14:44.590 --> 14:47.298
-I said you can't go!
-[gasps]

14:48.131 --> 14:49.756
You're not going anywhere.

14:51.215 --> 14:52.715
Garbage, where are you?

14:52.798 --> 14:54.798
I'm right here, home dog!

14:55.340 --> 14:56.340
Home dog?

14:56.423 --> 15:00.048
Uh, I meant, let's go home... dog.

15:01.340 --> 15:03.256
-[sniffs]
-[Fake Garbage] Come on!

15:05.465 --> 15:07.548
Come with us! Let us help you.

15:07.631 --> 15:11.590
[languidly] Stay. Let them make you happy.

15:11.965 --> 15:14.465
What? No! I can get you out!

15:14.548 --> 15:17.006
[Crumpulons chanting] Stay.

15:18.673 --> 15:21.090
Stella, come back!

15:21.173 --> 15:22.881
[languidly] Happy here.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.173
Need nothing.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.090
-[Crumpulons chanting] Stay.
-[clicks tongue] Ugh.

15:26.756 --> 15:28.090
[screams, grunts]

15:28.173 --> 15:29.381
[panting]

15:32.256 --> 15:33.673
[gasps]

15:33.756 --> 15:35.923
Would your crew make you happy?

15:38.840 --> 15:40.381
Then stay with us.

15:40.465 --> 15:42.465
[all chanting] Captain.

15:42.548 --> 15:44.006
-[grunts]
-[Fake Stella laughing]

15:44.840 --> 15:46.173
[gasps]

15:46.798 --> 15:49.340
[Chonies] That looks like us!
And Captain Garbage?

15:49.423 --> 15:50.423
[all] Huh?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.965
Hey! Whoa, who's that Rando posing as me?

15:55.048 --> 15:56.340
[laughs nervously] Weird, right?

15:58.215 --> 16:01.423
Team, [clears throat]
I just got a distress call from Happy.

16:01.506 --> 16:02.548
He's in trouble.

16:03.590 --> 16:06.506
Uh, oh, no! Poor Happy!
We better go help him, stat!

16:06.590 --> 16:07.923
I knew it!

16:09.090 --> 16:12.048
[whimpers] Come on home...
home dogs. [giggles nervously]

16:12.131 --> 16:14.215
[screaming]

16:16.090 --> 16:17.506
-[all grunting]
-[Fake Garbage screams]

16:17.590 --> 16:18.673
[impact grunts]

16:20.173 --> 16:21.506
[battle cry]

16:22.131 --> 16:23.923
[grunts, gasps]

16:24.006 --> 16:26.548
Ha! This one's for the Crumpulons!

16:26.631 --> 16:28.506
-[groaning]
-This one's for Mr. Spaghetti!

16:28.590 --> 16:29.590
[yells aggressively]

16:29.673 --> 16:32.131
Get off me, me! [grunts]

16:32.881 --> 16:34.715
[barks] Take that, me.

16:34.798 --> 16:36.923
[panting, grunts]

16:39.215 --> 16:40.381
Ow.

16:53.715 --> 16:56.590
Garbage, be a good boy and stay!

16:57.798 --> 17:00.131
Sorry! But today...

17:00.215 --> 17:01.673
I'm a bad boy.

17:04.673 --> 17:06.548
[screaming]

17:10.756 --> 17:11.798
[sighs]

17:13.548 --> 17:16.465
[sniffs] Yup. You smell like Garbage.

17:18.965 --> 17:20.215
[grunting]

17:20.298 --> 17:22.465
[Captain Garbage]
Garbage to Loaf. Mission over.

17:22.548 --> 17:23.715
-[gasps, sighs]
-You are relieved.

17:24.048 --> 17:25.298
[yelps]

17:25.381 --> 17:27.923
-[whimpers]
-[laughs]

17:30.298 --> 17:32.756
[gasps, groans]

17:34.048 --> 17:35.423
[snores]

17:42.715 --> 17:45.006
[inaudible]

17:50.923 --> 17:52.715
She manipulated me.

17:52.798 --> 17:56.881
She acted like she cared,
but it didn't matter what happened to me,

17:56.965 --> 17:58.965
as long as I did what she wanted.

18:00.298 --> 18:01.298
I get it.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.048
I'm sorry, but you didn't let her.

18:04.131 --> 18:05.256
The fake Chelsea didn't.

18:05.340 --> 18:08.423
Not just the fake Chelsea.
The real Chelsea, too.

18:09.173 --> 18:12.173
[sighs] It's time we look out
for each other.

18:12.256 --> 18:13.965
We should find a planet...

18:15.881 --> 18:17.298
for dogs.

18:18.048 --> 18:20.215
