WEBVTT

00:58.000 --> 00:59.680
Piece of shit!

01:23.280 --> 01:26.160
THE DAY BEFORE

01:28.160 --> 01:30.880
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:33.560 --> 01:35.320
You still here?

01:36.120 --> 01:38.280
Mama, go back to sleep, it's too early.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.160
Aren't you going to sleep?

01:40.720 --> 01:43.040
I'll go home now, don't worry.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.920
Go easy, it stings.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.479
Well? Will you tell me what happened?

02:12.720 --> 02:15.560
-They want to kill me.
-Yeah, but why?

02:16.720 --> 02:19.320
Don't ask, the less you know the better.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.480
It's a miracle I'm alive.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.960
No, it's not a miracle.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.960
You got Spadino to thank for it.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.840
Will you go make us coffee?

02:30.480 --> 02:32.920
Hey, I'm a hooker, not a waitress.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.480
Both services though, right?

02:48.400 --> 02:50.280
-You like her, huh?
-I guess...

02:51.560 --> 02:53.880
When I'm with her
it makes me think of my dad,

02:55.120 --> 02:57.440
he's been fucking hookers his whole life.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.400
Sit down, go on.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.880
What did you want to tell me?

03:06.480 --> 03:10.000
I'm in deep shit. If they get me
this time, they're gonna hurt me.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.320
-What kind of trouble are you in?
-I owe a guy 30,000.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.240
A guy you can't fuck around with?

03:20.800 --> 03:22.320
I don't know where to get it.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.960
-When do you have to give it to him?
-Don't ask.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.800
What have you got in mind?

03:35.720 --> 03:38.280
Chill, I'm not going to jail
for your bullshit.

03:42.720 --> 03:47.160
But you helped me last night.
I'll find the money for you.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.720
Thanks, Aureliano.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.720
One more thing...

03:56.360 --> 03:58.120
I want to speak to Spadino in person.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.720
I'm on it.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.160
No one should die like that.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.720
It shouldn't have happened. I'm sorry.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.440
This is what happens
when you're born a gypsy.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.920
And they say we're the animals.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.480
[in Sinti]
[This can't go unpunished, Vincenzo.]

04:51.560 --> 04:54.680
[Let's get these kids married,
then we'll let the whole city know]

04:54.760 --> 04:58.720
[that things have changed,
that they gotta respect us.]

04:59.520 --> 05:02.840
You're right, but there's a problem.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.760
My daughter doesn't want
to get married anymore.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.600
She says Spadino doesn't pay her
any attention. He's not behaving.

05:11.680 --> 05:16.200
If they don't get married,
you'll have to fight this war on your own.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.040
We have an understanding,

05:20.360 --> 05:23.640
I'm not risking what I've got
if our families aren't joined.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.080
Sure, I understand.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.280
But I promise you your daughter's wrong.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
[Come on, Spadino, get up!]

05:53.200 --> 05:54.080
What do you want?

05:54.440 --> 05:56.720
[For you to quit fucking around.]

05:57.760 --> 05:59.920
[You're not even good at getting a wife.]

06:00.160 --> 06:02.640
-What are you talking about?
-About Angelica.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.880
[She doesn't wanna marry you anymore.]

06:04.960 --> 06:08.120
Who cares,
you'll find me another girl, right?

06:08.840 --> 06:11.000
[I'll tell you once,
and I won't say it again.]

06:11.440 --> 06:13.560
[You're gonna fucking marry Angelica.]

06:14.920 --> 06:16.840
[The Sales are very important.]

06:17.520 --> 06:19.400
[You know we've got big plans.]

06:21.600 --> 06:22.520
[Let's go.]

06:23.800 --> 06:26.480
Let's go, get up, fool! Come on!

06:40.600 --> 06:43.400
-What's wrong with it?
-He's old.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.360
Where I come from we kill old horses.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.720
He was a champion,
he deserves a little respect.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.160
When do we get the Ostia land?

06:57.160 --> 06:58.680
There are billions at stake here.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.480
But keep in mind,
if they're at stake in Rome,

07:01.560 --> 07:03.080
it's only thanks to me.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.760
Let me work. I already told you,
Rome has its own pace.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.640
So do we.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.480
If this deal doesn't go through,

07:13.560 --> 07:16.160
I won't come to Rome
to talk to you anymore.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.000
Got that?

07:21.280 --> 07:24.280
Kill this animal.
You're getting soft in your old age.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.480
-Aureliano.
-Hey.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.960
-How are you?
-Good.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.280
Hey, man.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.440
-What happened?
-Nothing, just a scratch.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.560
Why didn't you come straight here?

08:07.640 --> 08:09.480
We were worried all night.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.960
-A friend took me somewhere.
-You should have made him bring you home.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.040
Now wall yourself up inside
until things calm down.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.640
You made me worry, Aureliano.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.760
They had to shoot me
for you to worry about me.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.360
See? I can't get anything right with him.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.000
Keep an eye out.

08:47.000 --> 08:47.880
It's him.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.800
Tiziano, let him through.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.000
Go.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.840
-The fuck you doing here?
-We need to talk.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.640
-I can't now. I'll call you later.
-It's not for me. It's for Aureliano.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.320
He wants to see you.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.320
Why?

09:08.080 --> 09:10.400
Because you saved his life,
maybe that's why.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.680
Tell him I'll call him later.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.360
Is he okay?

09:20.360 --> 09:21.240
Yeah.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.760
What are you doing?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.840
-Nothing.
-Aureliano...

09:59.040 --> 10:01.440
-How much do you need?
-Not much.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.560
-And you're stealing it from Dad?
-It's for a friend.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.440
Since when do you help out friends?

10:09.760 --> 10:11.520
Since they saved my life.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.600
Right, to return a favor.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.360
Stop. I've been covering your ass
since we were kids,

10:18.440 --> 10:20.280
but enough already, you gotta grow up.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.000
Don't preach to me.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.840
You're always fucking up,
and I always have to clean up!

10:25.720 --> 10:28.960
You killed my dog...
that's cleaning up?

10:29.040 --> 10:33.040
If you'd let him go like I said,
he'd still be alive.

10:35.320 --> 10:39.000
And if you'd minded your own fuckin'
business, no one would have shot me.

11:11.160 --> 11:14.280
YOU EARNED IT,
DO YOURSELF PROUD, DAD.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.680
What do you want?

11:43.840 --> 11:46.960
-Do you like it?
-What do you want? I'm busy.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.560
-I'll take you for a ride.
-I don't feel like it.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.600
-I'll take you somewhere nice to eat.
-I said I don't feel like it.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.560
-What do you feel like doing?
-With you, nothing.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.760
Come on,
an hour and I'll bring you home.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.320
Madame.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.880
I'm not worth a table?

12:32.200 --> 12:33.280
I'm in a hurry.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.720
Besides, if we sit at a table,
who knows what your husband will think.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.960
-He's not that dumb.
-To believe we've got a thing?

12:41.040 --> 12:43.880
-Amedeo, what do you want?
-To know what the party's saying.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.240
Who are they replacing Finucci with?

12:48.280 --> 12:52.280
The mayor wants someone clean,
with an impeccable résumé.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.600
-Well?
-Well, what?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.080
Who the fuck are they putting in?

12:58.320 --> 12:59.800
Gianni Taccon.

13:00.240 --> 13:04.560
The architect? The one who hung around
the party but no one ever gave a shit.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.160
You ought to be happy,
an idealist like you...

13:08.880 --> 13:11.040
Another one who never
climbed the ranks.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.760
So, how come you're so interested?

13:16.480 --> 13:18.880
Given the shit the party wallows in,

13:18.960 --> 13:21.320
I didn't want to find another Finucci
at my side.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.080
This time I want to be ready.

13:26.080 --> 13:30.160
-Be careful what you do.
-Is that a threat or a piece of advice?

13:30.240 --> 13:31.800
I don't know, you decide.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.720
Thanks for the information.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.120
Thanks.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.360
-How's the wound?
-Better.

13:55.240 --> 13:59.000
I spoke to Spadino.
He's tied up right now. He'll call you.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.200
All right.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.840
Listen, about the money...

14:03.280 --> 14:06.280
Aureliano, go somewhere else.
I need the room.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.880
-I wanted to introduce you...
-Later, I'm busy now.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.080
Let's go...
they gotta talk business in here.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
See that?

14:34.920 --> 14:37.200
It was that douchebag Samurai.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.640
Shut the door.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.800
Fuck him. If it wasn't for him,
we'd be celebrating now.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.760
Don't make me think about it.

14:48.720 --> 14:52.480
Listen, it's complicated
to get the money now, but I got an idea.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.160
-What?
-We'll go to the priest.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.200
We'll clean him out.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.280
-Please...
-How much you owe?

15:04.400 --> 15:07.640
-A lot.
-Then trust me and let me work.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.480
I'll let you work.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.480
Samurai, I'm calm,
and I've always listened to you,

15:13.560 --> 15:15.320
but you don't kid around with a son.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.320
You'll have your revenge, but not now.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.640
For now, you gotta keep your head down.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.800
You don't get it.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.840
They tried to kill my son,

15:33.160 --> 15:36.440
so now another fucking gypsy's gotta die!

15:36.520 --> 15:39.720
I couldn't give a fuck about business
or even keeping you happy.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.880
Is that your final word?

15:44.760 --> 15:48.640
Samurai, just think
if they tried to kill your son.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.960
Didn't have one for that reason.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.840
We were wrong.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.520
The problem isn't the son.
It's the father.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.760
So?

16:17.760 --> 16:20.840
I can't risk blowing the deal
because of Tullio Adami.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.760
So what do we do?

16:29.320 --> 16:31.600
I saw the solution in their house.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.840
Hello, good to see you again.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.680
We have a reservation for four,
but we are a bit early.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.120
-Good evening, sir.
-Hi.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.880
-Do you have a reservation?
-No.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.800
-Unfortunately, we're fully booked.
-But it's empty.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.760
Actually, all the tables are reserved.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.800
This is good, thanks.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.680
Order what you want,
today we'll eat everything.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.760
What are we doing here?

17:04.640 --> 17:07.839
You told your dad I ignore you,
now tell him I took you out to lunch.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.040
I'm not stupid.

17:10.119 --> 17:12.240
You could have avoided this show

17:12.320 --> 17:14.200
and told me right away you didn't want
to marry me.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.760
-I'm here now, for you.
-Yeah, but now it's too late.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.520
Yeah, too late to eat.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.720
Yo, buddy.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.720
Hey, man,

17:26.079 --> 17:27.920
I'll take these, thanks.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.000
Hi, enjoy your meal.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.280
Didn't hear you.
How we gonna play this?

17:59.960 --> 18:01.200
Let's go.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.240
I'm mortified.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.200
-To us!
-Can I move you to another table?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.080
It's not a question of tables.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.640
Call the police.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.360
Know what? I don't like this place
so much anymore.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.520
I'll take you somewhere else.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.640
Go.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.480
Bye, everyone, enjoy your food.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.760
Would you care for some fruit, Miss?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.360
Let's go.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.360
-What, are you going to ring the bell?
-To see if he's home.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.920
And if he answers, what do you say?
Come on, move.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.280
Wait.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.000
Go talk to him.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.240
-What do I say?
-Make something up, I'll go in.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.440
-Hello.
-Hello.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.360
-Are you the doorman?
-Yes.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.560
Hi, I'm a law student.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.480
I'm preparing my thesis
on the conditions of doormen in Rome,

19:52.880 --> 19:55.920
with particular reference
to condominium bylaws.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.000
Come on.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.760
How about this priest... Goddamn him.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.840
OSTIA LAND SALE PROPOSAL

22:10.040 --> 22:12.760
I'll give it all to you tonight,
I promise.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.920
Don't worry,
the money's not an issue anymore.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.320
Look at this horse.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.880
No one likes being broken in,

22:23.760 --> 22:25.520
but in the end, you know what?

22:25.600 --> 22:27.200
You live better in captivity.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.240
You're fed, taken care of,

22:30.840 --> 22:32.600
as long as you do what you're told.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.960
Horses are intelligent animals.
They know this.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.640
What do you want to do?

22:44.760 --> 22:46.360
I'll pay you back, I told you.

22:46.440 --> 22:50.400
You're a cop's son,
and you pushed pills in my gym.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.080
There's not much choice, Gabriele,

22:53.920 --> 22:56.760
either you do what I tell you
or your father dies.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.800
What do I have to do?

23:07.200 --> 23:08.600
You've got to kill an Adami.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.600
Tullio.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.960
Your buddy's father.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.120
Here,

23:27.720 --> 23:29.400
open your present.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.760
Enjoy.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.360
To tell the truth,
these accounts don't add up,

23:49.440 --> 23:52.360
I need a few more days
to go through them,

23:52.440 --> 23:53.920
if that's all right with you.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.840
Fuck off, Quirino,
this is no time to do accounts.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.840
Now I know why I can't touch Mom's kiosk.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.880
Because you and your boss
are doing a deal with the land.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.640
-What are you up to?
-None of your business.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.840
Will you stop bowing down
to that piece of shit?

24:34.920 --> 24:39.440
-The fuck you talking about?
-About you being Samurai's slave.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.920
But he defended you in front of him.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.240
Shut up, stop sticking up for this jerk.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.000
Oh! You really don't understand shit!

24:48.080 --> 24:50.520
You don't deserve
anything I've done for you.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.520
The fuck you talking about? Why?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.720
What the fuck did I do not
to deserve anything?

24:56.800 --> 24:59.040
Since I was born,
you can't stand the sight of me

24:59.120 --> 25:01.120
because you think Mom died
because of me.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.160
Say it, just say it!

25:07.000 --> 25:08.120
Fuck you!

25:35.240 --> 25:36.480
Yes?

25:38.560 --> 25:40.200
-Mr. Taccon.
-Hello.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.040
Cinaglia.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.080
-Take a seat.
-No, I'm fine.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.400
You don't remember me?
I remember you very well.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.080
The 1999 party convention,
the day you made that amazing speech

25:53.160 --> 25:55.680
about the general state of culture.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.880
Different times.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.320
-How's work going on the commission?
-Well.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.200
-We'll be working together from now on.
-It won't be an easy undertaking.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.200
-This commission is tempting for many.
-I know.

26:07.840 --> 26:11.320
I don't think you do.
Finucci did it right under your nose.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.920
I trusted him and when you trust someone,
you don't check on them.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.960
Anyway, I'm here now,

26:20.040 --> 26:22.680
and I can promise you
that anything that's not clear,

26:22.760 --> 26:26.440
any dealings that aren't transparent,
they will not get by me.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.320
We really needed someone like you here.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.120
-Good, carry on.
-Thank you.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.160
-Lele.
-Hi, Mara.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.600
-You looking for your father?
-Yes.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.680
Wait for him inside, I'll go call him.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.040
Thanks.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.600
Lele!

28:10.320 --> 28:12.760
I'll finish this report
and be right there.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.200
Can you wait five minutes?

28:14.280 --> 28:18.600
-Maybe I should come back later.
-No. We'll have coffee.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.960
See the suit? Did you try it on?

28:21.920 --> 28:23.040
Yes, it fits.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.440
I can't believe it, my son, the graduate.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.080
Do you feel ready?

28:30.800 --> 28:34.160
-I feel tired.
-Only normal, the last push.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.440
You know what we'll do?

28:36.200 --> 28:37.880
Go on a trip together, you and me.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.440
The last one,

28:40.440 --> 28:43.040
because who knows
when you'll have time for your old man?

28:45.360 --> 28:46.440
Would you like that?

28:47.440 --> 28:49.360
Yeah, I'd like that.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.520
Five minutes, I'll be back,
and we'll discuss it.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.520
On the commission,
Councilman Cinaglia is not corrupt,

29:24.600 --> 29:28.120
but you've got to approach Taccon
before Samurai does.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.880
You've got to make him see
only he can change things.

29:31.960 --> 29:35.280
You've got to make him feel important.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.760
You give me all this advice...

29:42.160 --> 29:43.240
Does it bother you?

29:43.760 --> 29:47.600
-If you want to do things your way...
-No, absolutely not, on the contrary.

29:48.160 --> 29:52.120
It just embarrasses me because
eventually I'll have to pay you back.

29:52.400 --> 29:55.640
Don't worry, we'll find a way.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.320
Of course.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.920
I've got to go now. I've got a meeting.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.800
-See you soon, dear.
-Goodbye.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.520
I'll see myself out.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.560
I'm expected at the Vatican.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.920
I don't want to know where you go.
It's none of my business.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.760
I'll be late. Goodbye.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.760
The ceiling isn't gonna fall on us, is it?

30:41.760 --> 30:44.080
If it was gonna fall,
it would have fallen ages ago.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.880
That's just great.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.760
How come you like this place so much?

30:55.680 --> 30:58.960
I'd like this place
to become the best in Ostia.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.320
Actually, in Rome.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.320
I'd like people to come from all over.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.480
Why don't you do it?

31:09.080 --> 31:10.680
Who's stopping you?

31:12.480 --> 31:13.600
Don't ask.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.720
What do you like?

31:24.200 --> 31:26.880
I know that sooner or later
I'd like to go to Senegal.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.800
What are you talking about?

31:31.080 --> 31:33.440
To do what?
People from there wanna leave.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.320
And I want to leave here.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.400
But why there?

31:38.480 --> 31:40.280
Because my home is there.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.480
Hi there.

32:07.400 --> 32:11.360
I thought about yesterday,
the money you asked me for...

32:11.440 --> 32:13.560
I can give some of it,

32:13.640 --> 32:15.560
not a lot, but maybe--

32:15.640 --> 32:18.640
Why are you giving me money now?
What's changed?

32:20.200 --> 32:21.200
Nothing.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.520
I thought about you, and I want to help.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.920
I don't need it anymore. I sorted it out.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.360
You've sorted it out?

32:29.680 --> 32:31.120
Then why the face?

32:32.800 --> 32:34.160
Tell me what's going on.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.440
You can't help me, Sara.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.240
Bye, Sara.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.080
-Give it to me.
-No, I'm not giving you anything.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.040
See, I treat you badly,
but at least I make you laugh.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.000
No one in Rome's got weed like I've got.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.400
A good reason to get married, I'd say.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.400
Fundamental.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.360
There are others, too.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.520
Me and you can't even touch
before the wedding.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.160
Now you care about the rules?

33:38.600 --> 33:40.200
There's a good reason.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.160
If your father catches me, he'll kill me.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.840
Not if he doesn't find out.

34:16.600 --> 34:19.880
-Tell me where the fuck you've been.
-I'm sorry, but...

34:19.960 --> 34:23.400
No matter what happens, you stand guard
and wait for your partner, okay?

34:23.480 --> 34:25.320
-Yeah, I know...
-Shut up.

34:26.600 --> 34:30.440
If I don't smash your head in and you're
still standing, it's 'cause it went okay

34:30.520 --> 34:32.199
and because I owed you a favor.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.960
But now we're even,

34:36.600 --> 34:37.760
all right?

34:37.840 --> 34:38.960
All right.

34:47.159 --> 34:49.000
Check out the priest's stuff, here.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.080
With this one alone, you'll get 20,000.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.840
Take this too and your debt's covered.

35:02.920 --> 35:03.960
Thanks.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.560
Have you calmed down?

35:11.160 --> 35:13.320
I wanted to introduce you,
but you were busy.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.360
This is Gabriele. He saved me.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.640
So, that's you.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.640
Thank you.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.880
Actually, I'm indebted to you.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.760
I've got stuff to do,
but when I come back, I wanna talk.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.240
Take care.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.440
Just as well,
for tonight he's not up our ass.

35:36.920 --> 35:37.800
Why?

35:37.880 --> 35:41.960
It's his weekly fuck with his hooker,
come hell or high water.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.240
Now can you see
why I got issues with Isabel?

35:48.240 --> 35:50.080
Because I don't want to become like him.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.840
Go do what you gotta do.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.080
I'm gonna lie down.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.720
Bye, Aureliano.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.760
You're Gabriele, right?

36:17.120 --> 36:18.120
Yes.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.280
I wanted to thank you.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.120
My brother's the person
I care most about in the world.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.680
I did what any friend would have done.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.640
He hasn't got many friends.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.920
How long have you known each other?

36:32.840 --> 36:36.080
Not long, but we hit it off right away.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.760
It's weird that he gets along
with someone like you,

36:38.840 --> 36:40.240
a cop's son.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.920
I don't know, maybe he likes me.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.120
Bye, Gabriele, nice meeting you.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.440
Watch out.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.280
It's Gabriele.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.480
Listen, Tullio Adami just left the house,

37:37.000 --> 37:38.200
but I've lost him.

37:38.480 --> 37:41.840
What the fuck?
Do what you've got to do and hurry up.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.080
Or else I'll kill your father like a dog.

37:49.160 --> 37:50.760
Let me know what happens.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.080
Spadino!

38:10.720 --> 38:12.400
[How did it go with Angelica?]

38:13.120 --> 38:15.320
All good. We're getting married.
Don't worry.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.920
[I'd like to see...]

38:56.360 --> 38:58.720
-What are you doing here?
-We need to talk.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.720
I can't see anyone without
the judge's permission.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.200
-It's risky for you, too.
-Five minutes.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.800
They've put Taccon in your place.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.920
They want to send a message
with an outsider,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.520
an intellectual.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.480
What will he find in the paperwork?

39:28.400 --> 39:30.400
All the scams of Rome.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.000
Finucci, I'm not joking.

39:33.080 --> 39:36.000
In the Ostia paperwork, what will he find?

39:38.360 --> 39:39.440
Listen to me,

39:40.280 --> 39:42.520
the Ostia deal is bigger than all of us.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.080
You can't even imagine
how much money's in it

39:46.160 --> 39:48.920
and what they're going to build
will bring even more.

39:49.400 --> 39:53.680
I already told you,
make them pay you a lot

39:53.760 --> 39:55.280
and don't ask anything else.

40:04.160 --> 40:07.280
Tell me the truth, did he send you?

40:08.440 --> 40:10.480
He wants to see if I hold up
under pressure.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.200
Samurai doesn't know shit.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.160
What's in the paperwork?

40:16.440 --> 40:17.320
Tell me.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.960
Samurai's decided to take the plunge.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.880
He's going to bring the Mafia
into legit business in Rome,

40:29.760 --> 40:31.680
and Ostia is the port of entry.

40:57.480 --> 40:58.520
Hey, Dad.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.720
Sorry about before, I had to rush off,

41:01.800 --> 41:03.800
a friend of mine was waiting for me.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.880
No, to go to a friend's graduation party.

41:11.640 --> 41:12.920
Soon, Dad.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.520
My graduation party will be soon,
I promise.

41:19.640 --> 41:20.800
Bye.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.360
Why did you want to see me?

43:04.280 --> 43:05.600
Why didn't you kill me?

43:06.920 --> 43:09.240
You got me all the way here
for this bullshit?

43:12.840 --> 43:14.440
Why didn't you shoot me?

43:15.680 --> 43:16.640
I don't know.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.480
What the fuck kind of answer is that?

43:21.560 --> 43:22.760
Can't think of anything better.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.520
I probably like you...

43:26.600 --> 43:28.840
Can't I like you?

43:29.920 --> 43:31.000
Yeah...

43:31.560 --> 43:33.280
I like you, too.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.280
But you're going against your brother.

43:39.200 --> 43:42.880
If it was you, what would you have done?
Would you have killed me?

43:49.520 --> 43:50.680
Have a hit.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.120
Again? It disgusts me.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.080
It's just a joint. It's not drugs.

43:56.960 --> 44:00.360
You should chill out occasionally,
always with this long face...

44:06.240 --> 44:08.960
-It smells good for gypsy shit.
-Fucking gypsies.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.240
You said it.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.440
Actually, I got it somewhere else.

46:02.200 --> 46:03.680
Piece of shit!

46:37.080 --> 46:38.880
