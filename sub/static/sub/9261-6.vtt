WEBVTT

00:00.245 --> 00:01.745
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

00:02.055 --> 00:03.055
He's got a gun!

00:07.745 --> 00:08.745
Grenades.

00:08.993 --> 00:10.056
We gotta go get Lem.

00:10.057 --> 00:12.121
He doesn't show,
assume he made the deal.

00:12.122 --> 00:14.010
They're gonna make you
give us up.

00:16.745 --> 00:17.745
Shane?

00:20.245 --> 00:21.245
Grenades.

00:21.371 --> 00:23.861
El salvadorans.
The leader's missing.

00:24.185 --> 00:25.532
His name is Guardo.
Start there.

00:25.679 --> 00:28.053
We're gonna find out who did this,
and we're gonna kill 'em.

00:28.054 --> 00:29.276
Why am I trusting you?

00:29.757 --> 00:32.256
If you care about Guardo,
you'll play it my way.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.554
Just let Nydia go.

00:33.735 --> 00:35.735
She's how we're gonna get to Guardo.

00:35.984 --> 00:37.608
You know, maybe he didn't do it, man.

00:37.664 --> 00:40.328
- If it wasn't Guardo, who was it?
- Look at him, man!

00:44.800 --> 00:47.605
Tilly, we know about you and Shane.
He's in the hospital.

00:47.606 --> 00:49.874
You stepped out and now
you're spreading your legs for Shane?

00:49.875 --> 00:51.597
Her old man got the drop on me.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.563
Some black bitch called on your phone.

00:53.564 --> 00:55.811
Is that who you're banging
while I got morning sickness?

00:55.812 --> 00:56.812
Get out!

00:57.596 --> 00:59.328
What do you know about
a guy named Hernan?

00:59.329 --> 01:02.258
He's a Fed', undercover,
in a salvadoran organization.

01:02.482 --> 01:03.466
Who are you?

01:03.510 --> 01:04.787
We're on the same side.

01:05.072 --> 01:05.883
Who are less in trouble,

01:05.884 --> 01:07.133
the salvadorans or the mexicans?

01:07.134 --> 01:09.072
I guess Guardo is collateral damage.

01:09.073 --> 01:10.572
Prick blew up a friend of mine.

01:10.573 --> 01:12.323
What, that cop? Guardo didn't do that.

01:12.324 --> 01:14.196
The word came down. No distractions.

01:14.197 --> 01:16.009
Shit, Guardo wasn't even up here then.

01:16.010 --> 01:17.398
He was in Mexico with me.

01:18.219 --> 01:20.330
Our son can never know what I've done.

01:20.698 --> 01:21.906
I killed Lem.

01:22.072 --> 01:23.669
Please forgive me. Please.

01:23.670 --> 01:26.504
I can't... I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.

01:26.631 --> 01:27.964
Please just ask me back.

01:35.945 --> 01:37.865
Who's got it? Eye's up!

01:38.027 --> 01:40.193
Nobody wants to talk.
Don't look at me!

01:40.338 --> 01:41.338
Somebody's got it.

01:41.839 --> 01:43.561
Can't do nothing in this place.

01:43.965 --> 01:46.104
All right, ladies.
This ain't your first time at the dance.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.716
You know the drill.
Drop 'em.

01:48.153 --> 01:50.760
Oh, yeah, pretty boy.
You got a lot to think about.

01:50.761 --> 01:51.968
Take your time.

01:52.778 --> 01:53.778
Not you. Hurry up!

01:55.237 --> 01:56.148
Come on, move!

01:56.778 --> 01:57.778
I want your shoes.

01:58.341 --> 02:01.118
I want your pants, your shirts.
Neat little piles.

02:01.530 --> 02:02.530
Is he alone?

02:03.085 --> 02:05.035
From the sound of it,
it's a do not disturb.

02:12.051 --> 02:13.683
Yeah. Come in.

02:16.495 --> 02:17.495
What is it, Benny?

02:18.237 --> 02:19.788
You have a visitor, Antwon.

02:19.789 --> 02:21.002
What does Rene look like here?

02:21.188 --> 02:22.414
I know. I'm sorry.

02:22.655 --> 02:25.511
I know my visitor can't be
half as fine as Rene.

02:26.346 --> 02:27.470
Ain't that right, baby?

02:28.656 --> 02:29.656
Better be right.

02:30.916 --> 02:32.490
Some white cop from L.A.

02:33.710 --> 02:36.522
He's pressing the warden
about seeing you right away.

02:36.693 --> 02:37.808
Give me 2 shakes.

02:38.023 --> 02:39.740
And shut that damn dog up.

02:40.835 --> 02:43.390
Now I ain't got time for
sweet nothings, baby.

02:44.585 --> 02:45.525
You gonna have to show me

02:45.526 --> 02:47.581
what the good God gave you right now.

02:48.459 --> 02:49.459
Come here.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.454 --> 03:02.168
My day just gets sunnier and sunnier.

03:02.725 --> 03:03.681
How's life in prison?

03:05.453 --> 03:06.326
Much better now

03:06.327 --> 03:08.604
that Kavanaugh went down
for framing you.

03:09.306 --> 03:10.583
Got my privileges back.

03:11.808 --> 03:13.812
I didn't know we still
had business together.

03:13.807 --> 03:17.918
You mean since my guy, who you put
a hit out on, got a grenade in his lap?

03:17.932 --> 03:18.987
I heard about that.

03:19.057 --> 03:21.306
Gotta give somebody points
for creativity.

03:21.307 --> 03:22.875
Yeah. You.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.244
I know you've been wanting
your pound of flesh from me,

03:26.245 --> 03:28.133
waiting for Lem to come into jail.

03:28.871 --> 03:33.005
But he ran, so you had your guys
on the outside find him, kill him.

03:33.184 --> 03:34.769
Make it look salvadoran.

03:36.621 --> 03:37.621
One time offer.

03:38.496 --> 03:41.162
Tell me who it was
on the outside who offed Lem,

03:42.601 --> 03:44.315
punishment will be limited to them.

03:44.871 --> 03:47.315
You don't give me all
their names right now,

03:48.017 --> 03:50.584
I will start tearing up
your gang from the outside

03:50.747 --> 03:53.307
and I will start tearing
at your perks from the inside

03:53.308 --> 03:55.640
and I promise you, I swear to God,

03:57.071 --> 03:58.277
I will find a way,

03:58.278 --> 04:00.892
no matter how many guards
you have on your payroll,

04:00.934 --> 04:02.524
to get to you inside here.

04:05.060 --> 04:07.056
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

04:08.301 --> 04:09.944
is my final encore.

04:10.933 --> 04:12.804
Making the great Vic Mackey

04:12.805 --> 04:14.160
think I'm everyone...

04:14.810 --> 04:15.981
and everywhere.

04:16.500 --> 04:20.680
Responsible for all the
worst crimes against humanity.

04:22.928 --> 04:23.928
It's sad, really.

04:24.741 --> 04:27.629
You know, chasing ghosts
hasn't done you any favors.

04:31.429 --> 04:33.425
I didn't off your boy.

04:34.119 --> 04:36.174
Wished I did, and so do you.

04:36.678 --> 04:39.011
'cause if you're
coming after me for this,

04:39.115 --> 04:40.755
that means you lost...

04:41.405 --> 04:42.779
your last clue.

04:44.990 --> 04:46.448
Good seeing you, though.

04:51.742 --> 04:53.303
He says, daddy, I got a boo-boo.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.185
- Shane!
- But my boo-boo's on the inside.

04:55.371 --> 04:56.365
- Oh!
- I talk to you later.

04:57.117 --> 04:58.866
- When'd you get in, man?
- About 10 minutes ago.

04:58.867 --> 04:59.741
We got a problem.

04:59.742 --> 05:00.740
What?

05:00.741 --> 05:02.018
Guardo didn't kill Lem.

05:02.121 --> 05:04.171
No one in the salvadoran
organization did.

05:04.740 --> 05:05.303
What?

05:05.304 --> 05:06.859
Took a flyer at Antwon, too.

05:07.305 --> 05:08.360
1-9ers are a no go.

05:08.930 --> 05:10.304
We're back to square one.

05:10.305 --> 05:14.094
No, Guardo's in a bunch of
charred pieces and crispy...

05:14.095 --> 05:15.061
He didn't do it.

05:15.305 --> 05:16.491
We got credible intel.

05:16.492 --> 05:17.179
From who?

05:17.180 --> 05:20.283
A federal I.C.E. agent
working undercover with the salvadorans.

05:20.284 --> 05:21.656
So now the Fed's have the final say?

05:21.831 --> 05:23.372
You know how many times
they've lied to us

05:23.373 --> 05:24.921
to keep us from playing
in their backyard?

05:24.922 --> 05:26.199
Doesn't feel like that.

05:26.672 --> 05:28.834
So he's the rare Fed' that lies well.

05:29.421 --> 05:30.698
Look, we finished this.

05:30.795 --> 05:34.027
There's nothing more
to find out, all right?

05:39.470 --> 05:41.303
Hey, Dutch, where are
we with Lem's case?

05:41.304 --> 05:43.803
Holding pattern.
Still working on finding Guardo.

05:43.804 --> 05:46.470
Guardo's a dead end.
I got it right from Hernan.

05:46.845 --> 05:48.090
You met with Hernan?

05:48.679 --> 05:50.616
I.C.E. Told me I couldn't get a sitdown.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.061
What's the lab report say?

05:52.179 --> 05:53.403
It's not back yet.

05:54.179 --> 05:54.865
It's due.

05:54.866 --> 05:56.678
I got a dead cop and no
suspect at the moment.

05:56.679 --> 05:58.991
You think you could light
a fire under their bunsen burner?

05:58.992 --> 06:00.203
Yeah. Maybe.

06:00.679 --> 06:01.306
Yeah?

06:01.307 --> 06:04.179
Did something happen last
weekend when you had Cassidy?

06:04.180 --> 06:05.457
<i>Something to upset her?</i>

06:05.492 --> 06:06.368
No. Why?

06:06.369 --> 06:08.115
Well, she says she won't
stay with you next weekend

06:08.116 --> 06:10.118
when I go to San Francisco
with Mattie and Megan

06:10.119 --> 06:11.615
for the cure autism now rally.

06:11.616 --> 06:12.429
Why not?

06:12.430 --> 06:13.992
She doesn't want to talk about it.

06:13.993 --> 06:16.867
I've already got the hotel reservations,
the plane tickets.

06:16.868 --> 06:19.241
I'll talk to her.
Whatever it is, we'll fix it.

06:19.242 --> 06:20.555
In the meantime,
I'm stuck here.

06:20.556 --> 06:22.805
You think you could drive
Cassidy over here later?

06:22.806 --> 06:23.993
She won't talk to you.

06:23.994 --> 06:25.117
<i>Well, that's not up to her.</i>

06:25.118 --> 06:26.244
I'll talk to you later.

06:26.245 --> 06:28.117
We're running a list
of ex-military felons in the area.

06:28.118 --> 06:30.562
Maybe they got Lem's grenade
from uncle Sam.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.933
Uh, interesting reading?

06:38.193 --> 06:40.248
Just checking out real estate prices.

06:40.249 --> 06:41.317
Trying to see what this house

06:41.318 --> 06:43.706
Mara and I are fixing up
is gonna be worth.

06:44.424 --> 06:46.924
You wanna jump in
on this Lem thing anywhere?

06:47.237 --> 06:48.403
It's a waste of time.

06:48.987 --> 06:49.987
We settled this.

06:50.302 --> 06:51.299
We can't be sure.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.799
This I.C.E. agent,
he has no reason to lie to us.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.300
You were sure enough to put a bullet
in Guardo before he confessed,

06:57.301 --> 06:58.523
and I trusted you then

06:59.051 --> 07:02.360
that we knew everything we were
ever going to know about that happened.

07:02.361 --> 07:04.083
And you did what you had to do.

07:04.301 --> 07:05.301
We all did.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.829
Now just put this
in the rearview mirror.

07:08.988 --> 07:11.821
Stop asking questions that
there are no answers to.

07:19.926 --> 07:21.870
Whatever funk he was in seems over.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.611
He seems at peace with it.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.278
I don't know how I can be
until I know for sure.

07:31.301 --> 07:34.912
When we took down that stash of grenades
the night that Lem died,

07:36.113 --> 07:38.376
Shane did the con solo, right?

07:38.926 --> 07:39.675
Vic, come on.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.787
Did you see anything weird that night?

07:42.113 --> 07:43.390
About Lem? The night...

07:43.489 --> 07:44.987
No. No.

07:50.116 --> 07:52.306
He did say, um...

07:53.803 --> 07:55.593
When Kavanaugh's frameup job was going

07:55.732 --> 07:56.726
and things looked really bad,

07:56.727 --> 07:58.066
he said something like...

07:58.803 --> 08:00.862
What if he said he had
a grenade from the bust

08:00.863 --> 08:03.585
and he was with Lem and
it went off accidentally?

08:03.616 --> 08:06.113
I just took it as him
want to lie to get you off.

08:06.114 --> 08:07.114
What did you say?

08:07.180 --> 08:08.036
I said it wouldn't help

08:08.037 --> 08:10.262
and he'd be admitting
aiding and abetting.

08:10.429 --> 08:11.429
What did he say?

08:13.428 --> 08:14.428
Nothing.

08:19.430 --> 08:22.238
You don't remember Shane's count
on grenades that night?

08:22.239 --> 08:24.127
Not here. At the salvadoran house?

08:24.241 --> 08:25.930
Jesus, Vic, I don't want
to think like that.

08:25.931 --> 08:27.653
Do you rember the count or not?

08:29.927 --> 08:30.927
Write it down.

08:35.491 --> 08:36.491
What do you have?

08:37.304 --> 08:39.121
73, like the home run record.

08:44.429 --> 08:45.595
We gotta run a check.

08:47.126 --> 08:48.459
What are we saying here?

08:49.867 --> 08:51.089
All we're saying is...

08:52.970 --> 08:54.177
As soon as we can...

08:56.292 --> 08:57.295
The first chance you get,

08:57.296 --> 08:58.503
you... you're gonna...

08:58.856 --> 09:00.545
quietly confirm

09:00.546 --> 09:02.701
that Shane logged in 73 grenades

09:03.760 --> 09:06.935
and that all 73 grenades are still
sitting there nice and neat

09:07.596 --> 09:09.342
in the bomb squad
evidence locker.

<i>Chasing Ghosts</i>

09:28.992 --> 09:29.992
Morning.

09:32.553 --> 09:34.108
Mind if I take one of these?

09:41.118 --> 09:42.118
Was this Lem's?

09:43.369 --> 09:44.797
I'm sorry. I didn't...

09:44.928 --> 09:46.428
No, no, no. It's all right.

09:46.741 --> 09:47.992
You're part of the team now.

09:47.993 --> 09:49.604
No reason it should go empty.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.554
Trust me. If i'm wrong,
I'll buy you a beer.

09:51.555 --> 09:52.777
Hey, there, gentlemen.

09:54.367 --> 09:56.089
Well, someone had a good night.

09:56.116 --> 09:57.838
Pregnancy sex is the best kind.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.679
Give you something to look forward to.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.346
Thanks. I'll give Mara a call.

10:02.492 --> 10:03.743
Just the crew I'm looking for.

10:03.744 --> 10:05.993
Got a body in an apartment
building on colby.

10:05.994 --> 10:07.382
Young woman. 20. Stabbed.

10:07.493 --> 10:09.430
We taking straight up homicides now?

10:09.431 --> 10:10.980
Victim's Emily Martin.

10:11.185 --> 10:12.992
Daughter of the city
controller Robert Martin.

10:12.993 --> 10:15.056
The guy that's got his fingers
on the city's purse strings.

10:15.057 --> 10:16.702
That's our special touch.

10:16.743 --> 10:18.305
A lot of people will be watching.

10:18.306 --> 10:21.028
Aceveda called himself
to ask for extra manpower.

10:21.556 --> 10:23.167
Just rember who you work for.

10:25.016 --> 10:27.181
These high profile cases
are just one big invitation

10:27.182 --> 10:28.618
to get ass reamed by the bosses.

10:28.619 --> 10:29.367
So let's get it done

10:29.368 --> 10:30.743
and get out of the spotlight.

10:30.744 --> 10:31.993
Let's try not to get ass reamed.

10:31.994 --> 10:34.116
Well, it wasn't a robbery.

10:34.870 --> 10:36.258
The extent of the wounds?

10:37.494 --> 10:39.216
Someone gave her an O.J. shave.

10:39.244 --> 10:41.056
A long way from daddy's wave of power.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.369
Maybe she got tired
of the west side.

10:42.370 --> 10:43.619
You guys know the drill.

10:43.620 --> 10:44.806
Look for nosy neighbors.

10:44.807 --> 10:46.557
Something there.
Maybe a shoe print.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.680
Good work, eagle eye.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.847
I knew they bumped him up for a reason.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.906
Come on. Let's start over here.

10:55.397 --> 10:56.397
Police. Open up.

10:57.334 --> 10:58.945
Hey, there's the poster girl.

10:59.127 --> 11:00.464
Looking good, Tina.

11:01.189 --> 11:03.232
Bow down to the poster girl.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.946
Man, I guess wet dreams
can come true.

11:07.336 --> 11:09.137
Hey, how you doing?

11:09.526 --> 11:10.748
I'm good. How are you?

11:11.836 --> 11:15.078
Good. I called you a couple of times.

11:15.274 --> 11:17.047
Is everything copacetic?

11:17.213 --> 11:19.490
Yeah. Well, you heard
about the transfer.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.524
They basically wanted me
in some P.R. role.

11:22.525 --> 11:25.802
talking in schools,
recruitment meetings, things like that.

11:25.890 --> 11:27.247
You mean the poster.

11:27.448 --> 11:28.892
Yeah, that's all that was.

11:29.574 --> 11:32.614
But I got to meet a couple of
people up at the chief's office

11:32.615 --> 11:35.947
and convinced 'em that I could represent
the force better out in the streets.

11:35.948 --> 11:37.612
Well, I think you belong here.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.072
Dutch, there's a woman in the lobby

11:40.073 --> 11:41.906
who wants to talk to a detective.

11:41.948 --> 11:42.948
Uh, Steve's free.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.255
She said actually
that it's about Guardo Lima.

11:46.336 --> 11:48.336
That's your suspect
in Lem's murder case, right?

11:48.337 --> 11:49.663
Uh, yeah. Excuse me.

11:50.275 --> 11:51.330
Tina, welcome back.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.739
We should talk about
your new assignment.

11:56.295 --> 11:57.213
Ok.

11:58.494 --> 12:00.439
You heard that Julian's
on the Strike Team, yeah?

12:00.440 --> 12:01.634
Yeah. Yeah.

12:01.894 --> 12:03.230
So who am I riding with?

12:03.231 --> 12:04.231
Well, for now, me.

12:05.881 --> 12:06.881
Is that a problem?

12:07.006 --> 12:09.285
No, no. You're a Sergeant now,

12:09.286 --> 12:11.304
and Sergeants don't get out that much.

12:11.660 --> 12:13.410
That's ok. I'm gonna keep you real busy.

12:13.411 --> 12:14.522
It's only temporary.

12:14.598 --> 12:16.596
You have information about Guardo Lima?

12:16.597 --> 12:18.586
He's missing. Something bad's happened.

12:18.587 --> 12:20.334
When was the last time you spoke to him?

12:20.335 --> 12:22.013
He hasn't called me in over a week.

12:22.014 --> 12:23.906
Well, that doesn't necessarily
mean anything's wrong.

12:23.907 --> 12:25.695
We talk every day. He loves me.

12:25.836 --> 12:27.724
No one has seen or heard from him.

12:29.390 --> 12:30.612
Was it Salseda?

12:30.702 --> 12:31.702
Who's Salseda.

12:31.764 --> 12:35.887
A mexican. He's the one who wanted
to take over the business Guardo ran.

12:36.263 --> 12:37.818
That cop knows all about it.

12:37.889 --> 12:38.896
He's the one who told me

12:38.897 --> 12:40.763
that Salseda wanted to kill Guardo.

12:40.764 --> 12:42.014
OK, which cop?

12:42.015 --> 12:43.765
I'm the one they had
in protective custody,

12:43.766 --> 12:46.821
so don't pretend you don't
know what i'm talking about.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.782
Kevin Hiatt, this is
Robert and Patricia Martin.

12:51.865 --> 12:54.043
Kevin's heading up the team
that's doing the investigation.

12:54.044 --> 12:55.355
I'm sorry about your loss.

12:55.356 --> 12:55.918
Thank you.

12:55.919 --> 12:57.576
The Martins are friends
of the department

12:57.577 --> 12:59.230
and I told them I'd be their go-between.

12:59.231 --> 13:01.502
Emily was a beautiful,
wonderful young woman.

13:01.503 --> 13:03.628
Do you know what she was
doing in this part of town?

13:03.629 --> 13:05.127
Our daughter didn't deserve this,

13:05.128 --> 13:06.254
and my wife doesn't deserve

13:06.255 --> 13:08.091
to be put through anything else.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.254
Of course.

13:09.504 --> 13:10.504
Give me a second.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.920
The Martins are dealing with a tragedy.

13:18.941 --> 13:21.003
Lots of people might try
to paint this a certain way,

13:21.004 --> 13:24.401
so we can't let anybody
sully this girl's reputation.

13:25.348 --> 13:26.879
Yeah, sure.

13:30.691 --> 13:33.636
Hey, witness says he saw
his neighbor Rahid Moore

13:33.791 --> 13:35.735
hurrying out carrying 2 trash bags.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.854
6 flights up, he still took the stairs.

13:37.855 --> 13:40.138
People say he's loud.
Gets visitors all night long.

13:40.139 --> 13:42.454
When they've asked him to keep it down,
he's made threats.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.642
Apartment's right over here.

13:43.643 --> 13:44.447
Let's pay a visit.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.675
- Uh, Vic?
- What's the problem?

13:46.676 --> 13:49.133
Aceveda and the old man want us
to keep the daughter clean.

13:49.134 --> 13:51.082
We don't even know
what we're supposed to be hiding yet.

13:51.083 --> 13:51.951
Hiding, hmm?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.074
I'll help you figure that out.

13:53.075 --> 13:54.908
Just keep it to yourself for now.

13:55.075 --> 13:56.963
Look, city controller on one side,

13:57.014 --> 13:58.763
Claudette's moral code on the other.

13:58.764 --> 14:01.650
So whoever you screw, you
get cut off at the knees.

14:01.873 --> 14:02.540
Fantastic.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.346
Trust me. There's a way out.
There always is.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.410
First we find out the truth.

14:07.857 --> 14:09.523
Then we figure out what to do.

14:13.230 --> 14:15.841
Late night visitors
means late night customers.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.292
He packed up his stash
and got out of dodge.

14:19.293 --> 14:20.606
If Rahid had a parking spot,

14:20.607 --> 14:21.980
the building will have his plate.

14:21.981 --> 14:23.314
I'll get it on the wire.

14:23.918 --> 14:24.918
Anything?

14:24.982 --> 14:25.982
Think so.

14:27.775 --> 14:29.261
Phone numbers. Good.

14:29.540 --> 14:32.216
Call 'em in. See if you can get
some names to go with those numbers.

14:32.217 --> 14:34.592
Hey, Vic. Found this under the bed.

14:35.157 --> 14:36.654
Guy must have need a boost for the road.

14:36.655 --> 14:38.155
Or daddy's little girl did.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.448
They came and got me one
night about a week ago.

14:45.838 --> 14:46.951
Took me to this safe house

14:46.952 --> 14:48.246
'cause they told me I was in danger.

14:48.401 --> 14:49.534
From Salseda?

14:49.874 --> 14:51.374
I just want to find Guardo.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.597
Could you look for him? Please?

14:53.687 --> 14:55.189
He's supposed to be in Mexico, isn't he?

14:55.190 --> 14:57.836
The main one said that Salseda
would try to kidnap me

14:57.837 --> 14:59.194
to get leverage on Guardo.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.906
And then they'd just, what, let you go?

15:02.537 --> 15:05.766
This one? He said that Guardo
never came back to L.A.,

15:05.862 --> 15:08.584
that they caught Salseda.
Then he dropped me off.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.380
They know what happened to Guardo.

15:11.741 --> 15:13.518
They know if someone killed him.

15:19.181 --> 15:22.514
Her time frame puts all this
during Vic's personal days off.

15:22.868 --> 15:24.364
I understand the time frame.

15:24.365 --> 15:26.976
Vic had Guardo on the phone.
Nydia confirms it.

15:27.401 --> 15:30.178
And there's no Salseda
in the department's records

15:30.339 --> 15:32.837
with any connection with the
salvadorans or the cartel.

15:32.838 --> 15:36.298
We are not gonna accuse Mackey
of murder and be wrong again.

15:38.152 --> 15:39.839
Let me put Vic in the room with her.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.451
I'll set it up as a surprise,

15:41.465 --> 15:42.464
but I'll let the camera roll.

15:42.465 --> 15:44.353
You shook that hornet's nest once.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.713
Haven't you been stung enough yet?

15:45.714 --> 15:47.340
It's not an accusation,
and if the girl's lying,

15:47.341 --> 15:48.341
what's the harm?

15:51.715 --> 15:52.715
Keep it contained.

15:53.029 --> 15:54.973
Good. I'll keep Billings out of it.

15:56.493 --> 15:58.560
Rahid Moore. How do we find him?

15:58.561 --> 16:00.124
I don't know anyone by that name.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.039
That's right. You're the
P.T.A. mom from eagle rock.

16:03.912 --> 16:05.213
Husband, two kids.

16:06.126 --> 16:07.188
Weird we found your number

16:07.189 --> 16:10.189
in Rahid's apartment
on the shity side of the freeway.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.325
The guy with two distribution arrests.

16:12.455 --> 16:14.015
Had three stars by your name.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.938
Your husband know you're on the spike?

16:15.939 --> 16:18.105
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:19.502 --> 16:21.420
- Bitch to hide, ain't it?
- Hey!

16:22.313 --> 16:24.627
Got to work real hard
to hide that secret.

16:24.628 --> 16:25.628
Stop!

16:25.753 --> 16:26.753
Let me see.

16:28.128 --> 16:29.689
Where you shoot up, on your ankle?

16:29.690 --> 16:31.529
- Between the toes?
- Get off me!

16:31.689 --> 16:33.244
Tell me where to find Rahid.

16:42.628 --> 16:43.628
Stop.

16:52.565 --> 16:54.176
I'm getting to the good part.

17:01.628 --> 17:04.182
Whew. Nice scab marks.

17:05.002 --> 17:06.058
Your husband knows.

17:06.130 --> 17:08.130
Otherwise, you're one frustrated gal

17:08.256 --> 17:10.314
when it comes to
the oral pleasures of life.

17:10.315 --> 17:11.253
Stop it.

17:11.255 --> 17:13.088
Then tell me what I need to know.

17:14.023 --> 17:15.138
Don't tell Jeffrey?

17:15.140 --> 17:17.590
I'm gonna tell him,
your kids, your friends.

17:17.683 --> 17:19.209
I'm even gonna tell the little old lady

17:19.210 --> 17:21.598
who brings the cookies
to the P.T.A. meetings.

17:30.287 --> 17:31.842
Sure is getting hot in here.

17:32.646 --> 17:35.252
OK. Hey, hey. This stops now,
you understand?

17:35.350 --> 17:36.347
What?

17:36.348 --> 17:38.529
This Tina bullshit.
This isn't high school.

17:38.530 --> 17:39.404
You know, that's too bad,

17:39.405 --> 17:42.028
because I heard she was gonna ask
you to the sadie hawkins dance.

17:42.029 --> 17:44.362
Hey, how's the quick
meter business going?

17:45.843 --> 17:47.279
The machines are still here,

17:47.280 --> 17:48.724
which means you're still
lining your pocket

17:48.718 --> 17:49.901
on the department's dime, right?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.647
I've been waiting for you
to throw it in my face.

17:51.648 --> 17:52.607
I'm gonna do more than that.

17:52.608 --> 17:54.217
I'm gonna throw it in I.A.D.'s face.

17:54.218 --> 17:56.242
Why, 'cause I gave you
a little jab about Tina?

17:56.243 --> 17:57.172
Yes.

17:58.218 --> 17:59.606
But I'll make you a deal.

17:59.905 --> 18:01.716
You get those machines
out of here today,

18:01.717 --> 18:04.777
you back off the Tina
and me thing forever,

18:05.156 --> 18:06.780
and I'll pretend it never happened.

18:06.781 --> 18:10.155
Remember that real partner vibe
we had going catching the runway rapist?

18:10.156 --> 18:12.092
That had a shelf life
of about what, 48 hours?

18:12.093 --> 18:13.632
- What's I.A.D.'s number again?
- All right.

18:13.781 --> 18:14.788
All right.

18:15.032 --> 18:16.920
But this is gonna take some doing.

18:18.110 --> 18:20.943
Now I have to cover my ass
for the rest of the day.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.798
You guys ever think about
putting some doors in here?

18:28.799 --> 18:30.910
You're in charge. See what you can do.

18:33.486 --> 18:34.110
What now?

18:34.111 --> 18:37.446
He texts me back with
a number and a time.

18:37.735 --> 18:39.901
Each number means
a different location.

18:39.924 --> 18:41.424
How long before he answers?

18:41.941 --> 18:43.486
It depends on when he can meet.

18:43.487 --> 18:44.709
And your P.T.A. schedule.

18:51.645 --> 18:53.423
I just don't understand
where this is supposed to go.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.971
All the numbers
are right there in the file.

18:54.972 --> 18:57.035
Just look it up. Hey, Kevin.

18:57.236 --> 18:58.236
Hi, Danny.

19:00.983 --> 19:02.094
This is Tina Hanlon.

19:02.859 --> 19:04.670
- Poster girl, right?
- Yes.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.316
Yeah. I'm Kevin Hiatt.

19:06.733 --> 19:08.010
Nice to meet you. Tina.

19:08.609 --> 19:09.609
Nice to meet you.

19:14.422 --> 19:16.168
Tina, did you finish that filing yet?

19:16.172 --> 19:18.227
It's a three week job.
What do you think?

19:21.735 --> 19:23.290
You know, I'm your superior.

19:23.545 --> 19:25.296
When you talk to me, lose the tone.

19:25.297 --> 19:28.908
You thought it was tough with Julian,
you ain't seen nothing yet.

19:28.936 --> 19:31.373
You've got to find a way
to be better than you were.

19:31.374 --> 19:33.998
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
being our permanent filing girl.

19:33.999 --> 19:36.876
When I was gone, I met a few
people in some high places,

19:37.619 --> 19:40.201
so I'm not exactly knocked
over by the new stripes.

19:40.437 --> 19:42.123
I'm not a trainee here anymore.

19:42.124 --> 19:44.235
I'll watch my tongue, but so will you.

19:44.375 --> 19:45.247
Or what?

19:45.248 --> 19:46.248
Or you'll have to explain

19:46.249 --> 19:49.582
why you can't get along
with the new face of the department.

19:55.750 --> 19:56.750
Hey, sweetheart.

19:58.504 --> 19:59.637
Everything ok, kiddo?

20:00.510 --> 20:01.501
Hey.

20:05.439 --> 20:07.272
You know what?
Let's go upstairs.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.567
All right, Cass.
What's going on?

20:15.359 --> 20:16.914
I don't have to talk to him.

20:20.049 --> 20:21.235
Look, you're causing your mom

20:21.236 --> 20:22.902
a lot of stress here, sweetie.

20:23.049 --> 20:24.840
Mattie and Megan have
a beautiful weekend planned

20:24.841 --> 20:25.944
with a bunch of kids just like...

20:25.945 --> 20:28.395
I could stay with Falovia.
Her parents said it's fine.

20:28.396 --> 20:29.610
Hey, you're staying with me.

20:29.611 --> 20:30.611
Or not.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.991
Let's talk about what's bothering you.

20:36.631 --> 20:37.631
Fine.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.633
My friend Brian, his dad's a lawyer,

20:41.187 --> 20:42.964
did a "Lexis/Exis" search on you.

20:42.999 --> 20:44.721
I saw all the shit you've done.

20:44.936 --> 20:45.811
What?

20:45.812 --> 20:47.123
The brutality complaints.

20:47.124 --> 20:49.235
The I.A.D. guy thought
you killed people.

20:49.312 --> 20:49.999
Oh, Cassidy.

20:50.000 --> 20:50.560
Listen to me.

20:50.561 --> 20:52.435
People say things and write things.

20:52.436 --> 20:54.491
That does mean that they're true, ok?

20:54.687 --> 20:57.575
That I.A.D. cop got caught
trying to frame your father.

20:57.749 --> 20:59.137
He's the one in jail now.

21:00.187 --> 21:02.312
I don't want to learn
about life from you.

21:02.313 --> 21:03.562
You have nothing to teach me.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.062
Hey, I'll teach you some respect.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.140
Respect,

21:06.345 --> 21:07.403
is earned.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.250
Cassidy...

21:11.564 --> 21:13.437
Whatever you've read,
whatever you've heard,

21:13.438 --> 21:15.000
it's not the whole truth, honey.

21:15.001 --> 21:17.445
Like the baby you had
with some other woman?

21:23.751 --> 21:26.000
I heard mom taking on
the phone with grandma.

21:26.001 --> 21:27.556
She didn't know I was awake.

21:29.627 --> 21:30.627
Cassidy...

21:32.377 --> 21:33.742
That's adult stuff.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.187
You don't have to concern
yourself with that right now.

21:37.188 --> 21:41.021
You kept a secret that I have
some baby brother i've never even seen?

21:55.690 --> 21:57.564
Vic, Rahid answered the text message.

21:57.565 --> 21:58.565
We got a location.

21:58.754 --> 21:59.754
- Vic?
- What?

21:59.814 --> 22:02.626
Somebody upstairs say
they've got information on Guardo Lima.

22:02.627 --> 22:03.565
What kind of information?

22:03.566 --> 22:04.558
I had trouble following it.

22:04.559 --> 22:05.784
You know that world better than I do.

22:05.785 --> 22:07.252
I'm buried. Can you talk to him?

22:07.253 --> 22:08.753
I'm kind of busy right now.

22:09.071 --> 22:11.113
Well, if it's about Lemansky's
murder, it could be important.

22:11.114 --> 22:12.638
Hey, Vic, let's go.

22:13.004 --> 22:14.938
I got a location on a murder suspect.

22:14.939 --> 22:18.439
If they're still around when I get back,
i'll chat 'em up then.

22:40.582 --> 22:43.461
Valerie couldn't make it,
but she sends her regards.

22:45.959 --> 22:48.726
You want to tell us why you ran out
of your apartment with 2 trash bags?

22:48.727 --> 22:49.963
Don't you dump your trash?

22:50.020 --> 22:51.408
Not the day after pickup.

22:51.893 --> 22:53.458
That's when the bins is empty.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.417
Emily Martin. She was in
your apartment today.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.456
Never heard of her.

22:58.457 --> 23:01.457
So when her blood comes back
off the bottom of your shoe,

23:01.458 --> 23:03.019
you gonna tell us
you never stepped in it?

23:03.020 --> 23:05.519
You stabbed her, then
you ran out and dumped the knife,

23:05.520 --> 23:07.832
and Johnnie Cochran ain't
alive to represent you.

23:07.833 --> 23:09.777
Do you know who this girl was, man?

23:10.298 --> 23:11.353
You mean her daddy?

23:11.360 --> 23:11.859
Yeah.

23:11.860 --> 23:13.526
Some big, important city dude.

23:13.738 --> 23:16.026
Vips get quick police response.

23:16.173 --> 23:17.922
Now, we're gonna hand over
his daughter's killer,

23:17.923 --> 23:20.423
and they're gonna make
an example out of you.

23:23.342 --> 23:25.119
I let her suck my dick. So what?

23:25.464 --> 23:27.465
That sure as hell
don't mean I killed her.

23:27.466 --> 23:29.338
Aside from your winning personality,

23:29.339 --> 23:31.963
is there any other reason why Emily
would want to play head games with you?

23:31.964 --> 23:33.575
She need fuel for the needle.

23:34.131 --> 23:36.091
Didn't have the money
to keep herself mellow,

23:36.092 --> 23:38.964
so she started paying another dude
with some mouth and pussy.

23:38.965 --> 23:39.965
What dude?

23:40.027 --> 23:43.838
Snail. He moved some shit
for me over in Brentwood.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.965
I brought her around a couple times.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.846
What can I say?
The girl was smart enough

23:47.847 --> 23:50.345
to cut out the middleman
and go directly to the source.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.908
How did snail feel about that?

23:51.909 --> 23:53.464
White boy's a control freak.

23:53.784 --> 23:54.839
He got on the shit,

23:55.347 --> 23:57.013
then started rationing it out.

23:57.471 --> 23:59.409
Thought he could keep
the pussy on a leash.

23:59.410 --> 24:00.687
You see him kill Emily?

24:01.846 --> 24:02.846
I heard something.

24:03.033 --> 24:05.699
By the time I got outside,
she was already done.

24:06.971 --> 24:09.221
And I knew y'all was gonna be
crawling all over the place,

24:09.222 --> 24:12.158
so I stuck my stash in the
trash and stepped outside.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.659
Pat yourself on the back later.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.971
Right now you're gonna tell us
where Snail is.

24:16.223 --> 24:17.189
Right?

24:18.597 --> 24:20.208
I'll tell you something else.

24:20.536 --> 24:21.536
That girl...

24:22.788 --> 24:24.399
She had no love for her pops.

24:26.722 --> 24:28.284
What's the latest
with the Martin murder?

24:28.285 --> 24:29.901
Getting to a dark place.

24:29.902 --> 24:30.570
Meaning?

24:30.571 --> 24:32.288
The daughter was
a heroin addicted whore.

24:32.289 --> 24:34.785
Paid for her drugs with
pussy and mouth favors.

24:34.786 --> 24:36.598
Other than that, she was
pippi longstocking.

24:36.599 --> 24:38.154
That's a lot to get between.

24:38.973 --> 24:40.535
He's a friend
of the department's, but...

24:40.536 --> 24:41.847
But if this thing's uncontrollable,

24:41.848 --> 24:44.292
there's no sense in you
getting burned, too.

24:46.345 --> 24:47.680
We need to appear loyal.

24:48.410 --> 24:51.348
But if the press gets ahold of the
information, that's out of our control.

24:51.349 --> 24:53.222
Martin can have somewhere
else to focus his anger.

24:53.223 --> 24:55.278
Someone's gotta take the heat, right?

24:57.349 --> 24:58.910
Anything I should know about?

24:58.911 --> 25:00.244
Nothing we can't handle.

25:01.286 --> 25:02.973
Don't let these people influence you.

25:02.974 --> 25:04.473
Follow the case where it leads.

25:04.474 --> 25:06.661
The VIP key's only
gonna open so many door.

25:06.662 --> 25:07.662
You got it?

25:09.475 --> 25:11.363
Now's the time to be taking notes.

25:12.037 --> 25:13.145
- Hey, Vic.
- Excuse me.

25:21.663 --> 25:24.413
Shane logged in 73 grenades
that night just like we rembered.

25:24.414 --> 25:25.412
You talked to the bomb squad?

25:25.413 --> 25:26.555
It seemed like a paperwork thing.

25:26.556 --> 25:28.418
Had a rookie count 'em all by hand.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.578
73. All accounted for.

25:37.804 --> 25:40.375
Oh shit. You know I'm an asshole,

25:40.376 --> 25:43.756
first I doubt of Lem, now Shane.
I'm a complete asshole, man.

25:44.071 --> 25:46.765
No, we just wanted answers.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.111
This is a good one to get.

25:49.289 --> 25:50.400
Maybe Shane's right.

25:51.413 --> 25:53.968
Maybe we got all the
answers we're gonna have.

26:05.352 --> 26:07.030
Hey, Danny, got a minute?

26:08.165 --> 26:09.165
Of course.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.235
What's up?

26:20.777 --> 26:22.332
My daughter knows about Lee.

26:22.464 --> 26:23.464
Oh, Jesus.

26:23.852 --> 26:24.855
How?

26:25.922 --> 26:28.088
She heard Corrine talking on the phone.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.573
Look, no offense,
but she may be your ex,

26:30.649 --> 26:33.037
but that lady's been
a real pain in my ass.

26:33.774 --> 26:36.996
Now, look, Vic, I chose
to do this alone for a reason, ok?

26:37.213 --> 26:38.961
I don't need a hassle around here.

26:38.962 --> 26:41.795
This isn't people in the barn.
This is my daughter.

26:41.899 --> 26:44.510
Yeah, well, I never wanted you
to get involved.

26:44.726 --> 26:47.461
Not you, not your ex,
not your kids.

26:47.569 --> 26:51.767
I've learned as a parent
that things don't go as we planned.

26:52.899 --> 26:53.899
Do they?

26:57.401 --> 26:58.401
So now what?

27:07.277 --> 27:08.273
Vic and I got the front.

27:08.274 --> 27:10.385
You guys come in
from around the back.

27:11.275 --> 27:12.275
Ok, let's go.

27:32.563 --> 27:33.862
Wait. Wait, wait!

27:35.188 --> 27:36.188
What?

27:37.688 --> 27:38.688
Shit!

27:38.939 --> 27:39.939
That's a .45.

27:40.565 --> 27:42.731
These vests aren't
gonna be worth shit.

27:44.813 --> 27:45.813
Hit it!

27:53.437 --> 27:54.437
Go!

28:29.848 --> 28:30.848
Get down!

28:31.723 --> 28:32.723
Hiatt, I got him!

28:33.034 --> 28:34.034
Don't move!

28:34.473 --> 28:35.472
Are you hit?

28:35.473 --> 28:36.473
No.

28:37.224 --> 28:38.829
I'm not hit.
Bitch!

28:40.849 --> 28:42.348
I'm taking this guy in alone.

28:42.349 --> 28:42.846
What?

28:42.847 --> 28:43.783
You know the situation.

28:43.784 --> 28:45.846
There's no way you can
walk away from it clean.

28:45.847 --> 28:46.847
So screw.

28:47.223 --> 28:49.099
What the hell's the city controller
even do, anyway?

28:49.100 --> 28:51.223
Eliminates the Strike Team
with the stroke of a pen.

28:51.224 --> 28:53.098
This guy took shots
at both you and Hiatt.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.955
Shane's right.
We can't walk the guy into the cage

28:54.956 --> 28:57.091
who took shots at cops
without messing up his hair some.

28:57.092 --> 28:58.180
It sends a bad message.

28:58.181 --> 28:59.779
Martin's a friend of the department.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.155
That means more money, more cops,
so we have to consider it.

29:02.156 --> 29:04.154
Look, the Captain said
we didn't have to worry about that.

29:04.155 --> 29:05.404
She doesn't have all the pieces.

29:05.405 --> 29:07.279
We got the suspect.
Let's just take this guy in.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.265
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm just doing it alone.

29:09.266 --> 29:10.872
No! I'm not comfortable with that.

29:10.873 --> 29:13.185
Look, we're gonna get
squeezed whatever we do.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.130
Maybe I can figure a way around it.

29:15.249 --> 29:16.915
But if not, I'll take the hit.

29:16.936 --> 29:17.999
For the rest of us? Why?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.749
Because I'm out of here
at the end of the month.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.687
There's nothing else they can do to me.

29:21.688 --> 29:23.061
Listen, maybe I should take him in.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.811
Look, you guys all have
something to lose.

29:25.812 --> 29:28.311
Now, maybe there's a
compromise to be worked out,

29:28.312 --> 29:30.923
but you guys aren't the
ones to be compromised.

29:34.126 --> 29:35.436
He needs to show up back at the barn

29:35.437 --> 29:37.061
looking the same way he looks now.

29:37.062 --> 29:39.284
Won't mess up a hair on his little head.

29:46.188 --> 29:48.563
You brought the knife.
You followed the girl.

29:48.564 --> 29:50.291
Death penalty's a slam dunk.

29:50.938 --> 29:53.001
I can make it so
you could avoid all that.

29:53.002 --> 29:54.811
Maybe even see the light of day again.

29:54.812 --> 29:56.251
What are you talking about?

29:56.252 --> 29:57.974
You know who Emily's father is?

29:59.189 --> 30:01.744
Well, the family wants
to avoid embarrassment.

30:01.939 --> 30:04.716
You just gotta be willing
to tell the right story.

30:05.813 --> 30:07.424
Yeah? What's the right story?

30:09.183 --> 30:10.056
Good boy.

30:11.753 --> 30:14.217
Detroit, bring him up to interrogation.

30:21.377 --> 30:23.813
How'd you like to walk out
of here with no charges?

30:23.814 --> 30:25.147
I'd like that very much.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.913
Step around. I'll tell you how.

30:31.128 --> 30:32.128
Hey, you're back.

30:32.753 --> 30:34.252
Any word on the lab results?

30:34.253 --> 30:36.438
They promised me by
the end of business day.

30:36.439 --> 30:37.994
Uh, that woman's still here.

30:38.440 --> 30:39.314
What woman?

30:39.315 --> 30:40.940
The one with information on Guardo Lima.

30:40.941 --> 30:41.939
Oh, right.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.854
She's stuck around this long.

30:44.764 --> 30:46.677
Uh... Yeah. Ok.

30:46.789 --> 30:48.636
Thanks. She's in interrogation one.

30:48.766 --> 30:49.769
Got it.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.674
Guardo never came back.

31:03.234 --> 31:04.888
<i>Guardo's a mysterious guy.</i>

31:08.789 --> 31:10.405
Did you do something to him?

31:10.941 --> 31:12.107
I never even saw him.

31:13.798 --> 31:15.186
What happened to Salseda?

31:15.360 --> 31:16.582
He must have got away.

31:16.860 --> 31:18.298
I heard from people in Mexico.

31:18.299 --> 31:20.299
They said Guardo came back to L.A.

31:20.423 --> 31:23.256
I heard the same thing.
I only wish I'd caught him.

31:24.683 --> 31:25.738
I don't understand.

31:25.808 --> 31:28.432
We heard a rumor that
Salseda wanted to kill Guardo.

31:28.433 --> 31:30.015
We didn't know if it was true but,

31:30.647 --> 31:33.426
Guardo was a suspect in the murder
of a cop, so I didn't give a shit.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.554
So you lied to me?
You kept me prisoner?

31:36.621 --> 31:40.526
<i>No. I told you you could
leave whenever you wanted.</i>

31:40.684 --> 31:42.239
The smart thing was to stay.

31:43.721 --> 31:46.683
All the stuff Guardo did,
it's only a matter of time.

31:46.684 --> 31:49.239
You're lucky he didn't
drag you down with him.

31:57.684 --> 31:59.434
Why don't we just get
Kavanaugh out of jail?

31:59.435 --> 32:00.746
Have me investigated again?

32:00.747 --> 32:04.111
Witness protection?
Sounds more like kidnapping to me.

32:07.531 --> 32:08.776
All right,
I wanted Guardo.

32:10.949 --> 32:13.310
I heard about Salseda on the street,
so I used it.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.563
I would have used
anything I had to get him,

32:15.564 --> 32:16.937
to bring him in for Lem's death.

32:16.938 --> 32:18.750
But the mexicans got to him first.

32:18.751 --> 32:20.639
You did all this based on a rumor?

32:20.815 --> 32:21.815
Yeah, I did.

32:22.126 --> 32:25.500
If I had ignored that rumor
and Nydia had got killed by that guy,

32:25.501 --> 32:28.252
you'd be asking me a lot
tougher questions right now.

32:28.253 --> 32:29.813
So you never found Guardo?

32:29.814 --> 32:32.205
- No, I...
- She seems convinced you did.

32:32.505 --> 32:34.440
For all we know,
Guardo could have sent her here

32:34.441 --> 32:37.996
to make us think that he's dead,
just to throw us off his track.

32:38.128 --> 32:39.239
Oh, for Christ sake.

32:39.940 --> 32:42.628
She's in love with a guy
who blows up kids for a living.

32:42.629 --> 32:44.878
You're trying to show people
why you should stay.

32:44.879 --> 32:48.101
This escapade looks like
another reason why you should go.

32:51.065 --> 32:52.953
Guardo was killed by the mexicans.

32:53.627 --> 32:55.564
You don't believe me, talk to Hernan.

32:55.565 --> 32:57.676
Tell me how to contact him and I will.

32:58.503 --> 33:00.939
I'll close the books on the
girlfriend's false accusations.

33:00.940 --> 33:01.940
Ask Hiatt.

33:18.516 --> 33:20.515
You caught the man that killed Emily?

33:20.516 --> 33:21.516
Yeah.

33:23.765 --> 33:27.042
I think you know what your
daughter was into when she died.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.206
She was an addict.

33:29.515 --> 33:33.015
I tried to help her, but
she wouldn't take it so I cut her off.

33:33.706 --> 33:35.330
I thought it would keep her
from buying more.

33:35.331 --> 33:38.553
Do you know what your daughter
was doing to get her drugs?

33:39.080 --> 33:40.420
She threw it in my face,

33:40.766 --> 33:42.599
trying to get more money from me.

33:43.003 --> 33:44.365
Well, it was all true.

33:45.975 --> 33:48.495
But that's not how history has to read.

33:51.641 --> 33:52.641
Thank you.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.468
I mean, there are some
things I can't fake.

33:55.581 --> 33:58.015
The M.E.'s gonna find
that heroin in her system.

33:58.016 --> 33:59.293
I'll take care of that.

34:04.330 --> 34:07.052
I've got an appeals hearing
in a couple of weeks.

34:07.209 --> 34:10.121
They're going to decide
whether to force me out or not.

34:10.232 --> 34:11.879
Well, I'll see what I can do.

34:18.406 --> 34:19.853
Must be good to be king.

34:24.393 --> 34:25.949
Snail dealt for me a little.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.666
He was in over his head.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.393
Told me about this girl

34:29.395 --> 34:31.783
that was trying to
get him out of the life.

34:32.123 --> 34:33.206
Shame.

34:33.833 --> 34:36.333
<i>Just trying to get him
to stop selling drugs.</i>

34:38.333 --> 34:40.056
<i>Guess she was a real nice girl.</i>

34:41.833 --> 34:44.777
Emily found out I was dealing,
she wanted me to quit.

34:45.157 --> 34:46.870
She followed me up to Rahid's apartment,

34:46.871 --> 34:48.536
trying to stop me from buying.

34:49.373 --> 34:51.484
Kept pressing me hard in the elevator.

34:52.498 --> 34:53.498
I just lost it.

34:54.130 --> 34:55.734
<i>She didn't deserve any of it.</i>

35:01.747 --> 35:02.802
What's the problem?

35:03.177 --> 35:04.867
We shouldn't be playing God.

35:04.979 --> 35:06.442
God creates all men equal.

35:06.499 --> 35:07.622
Once they get out of the womb,

35:07.623 --> 35:09.178
he starts playing favorites.

35:16.276 --> 35:17.886
Is that Lem's
lab report?

35:18.563 --> 35:19.311
Is it?

35:19.312 --> 35:21.256
Yeah, and the final autopsy report.

35:21.437 --> 35:22.437
And?

35:22.497 --> 35:25.274
Nothing much. No fingerprints.
No DNA left behind.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.484
Well, let me see it.

35:28.625 --> 35:29.560
You think there's anyone

35:29.561 --> 35:32.061
who wants to solve Lem's murder
more than me?

35:32.499 --> 35:35.054
There's crime scene photos
and autopsy photos.

35:35.380 --> 35:38.012
Curtis was eviscerated
from the waist down.

35:38.064 --> 35:39.064
Give me it.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.803
What report is this?
This is new.

35:53.959 --> 35:55.913
That's Kavanaugh's last report.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.062
Part of the deal he made
when he came clean about you

35:58.063 --> 35:59.729
was providing full disclosure.

36:14.877 --> 36:16.499
Hey, Kev, can I ask you something?

36:16.500 --> 36:17.500
Absolutely.

36:19.063 --> 36:19.750
Hey.

36:19.751 --> 36:20.751
Hey.

36:21.566 --> 36:22.566
Hey, Dutch.

36:23.953 --> 36:26.071
Hey, Tina. That project I gave you,

36:26.072 --> 36:27.377
you made a couple mistakes.

36:27.378 --> 36:29.489
Come on. I'll show you before I leave.

36:30.613 --> 36:31.655
- Thanks.
- Sure.

36:31.656 --> 36:32.814
- See ya.
- Bye.

36:36.449 --> 36:38.214
Did you ever ask me about Hernan,

36:38.314 --> 36:41.687
that I.C.E. agent in the
salvadoran organization?

36:41.688 --> 36:42.319
Sure.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.776
Did you guys get in touch with him?

36:43.777 --> 36:44.835
- Yeah.
- How?

36:44.836 --> 36:45.876
It's easier to negotiate

36:45.877 --> 36:47.101
between Federal Agencies.

36:47.102 --> 36:49.126
But, you're not a Federal Agent anymore.

36:49.127 --> 36:50.761
No. No, not anymore.

36:53.046 --> 36:56.315
Careful with that.
It's a sophisticated piece of machinery.

36:56.316 --> 36:58.099
I don't want to see any dings in it.

36:59.139 --> 37:00.559
I gave it some thought.

37:00.867 --> 37:03.356
If you want to keep the machines,
go ahead.

37:03.579 --> 37:05.671
Why, so you'll still have it
to hand over my head?

37:05.672 --> 37:06.767
Yeah, that's right.

37:06.768 --> 37:08.132
No, thanks. I'll pass.

37:08.197 --> 37:10.463
I can keep the leverage
or you can lose the money.

37:10.464 --> 37:11.671
It's your call.

37:14.407 --> 37:15.407
Hey, guys?

37:16.033 --> 37:17.033
Hang on a second.

37:29.563 --> 37:31.662
Hey, Cassidy. Come on in.

37:37.136 --> 37:38.472
This is Lee.

37:45.462 --> 37:46.688
What's his whole name?

37:46.689 --> 37:48.006
Lee carson sofer.

37:48.452 --> 37:50.263
Carson's my mom's maiden name.

37:52.989 --> 37:54.232
What's his birthday?

37:54.698 --> 37:57.856
On the second. 6:19 A.M.

38:05.844 --> 38:07.328
Do you want to hold him?

38:09.262 --> 38:10.936
Everything
all right, Cass?

38:13.981 --> 38:16.601
No, I... I don't want to hold him.

38:17.811 --> 38:18.866
I just want to see.

38:22.809 --> 38:23.809
That's ok.

38:25.308 --> 38:26.308
Another time.

38:31.124 --> 38:31.684
Hey.

38:31.888 --> 38:32.685
Hey.

38:33.597 --> 38:35.351
Vic wants the three of us to meet.

38:35.435 --> 38:36.435
When?

38:36.436 --> 38:37.436
Right now.

38:37.936 --> 38:38.991
Portillo Auto Body.

38:39.622 --> 38:41.184
He wants to walk Lem's crime scene

38:41.185 --> 38:43.129
the time of night that it happened.

38:43.309 --> 38:44.787
See if there's anything
the lab boys missed.

38:44.788 --> 38:46.116
Lab report came in?

38:46.372 --> 38:47.321
Yeah.

38:47.377 --> 38:48.496
Anything useful?

38:49.364 --> 38:50.498
I don't think so.

38:52.371 --> 38:53.637
You wanna ride together?

38:53.705 --> 38:56.372
I got to finish this paperwork
on our stabbing.

38:56.373 --> 38:57.747
I'll be five minutes behind you.

38:57.748 --> 38:59.627
Cool. I'll, uh...

39:00.240 --> 39:01.437
See you there.

39:01.503 --> 39:02.414
Ok.

39:20.927 --> 39:21.763
Vic: <i>Yeah?</i>

39:22.468 --> 39:23.564
He's on his way.

39:23.999 --> 39:24.660
Good.

39:24.661 --> 39:26.372
<i>You sure you don't want me to be there?</i>

39:26.373 --> 39:28.724
No. Keep your distance.

39:29.435 --> 39:30.435
Ok.

40:05.076 --> 40:05.689
Hey.

40:08.376 --> 40:09.814
Wanna wait for Ronnie or what?

40:09.815 --> 40:11.092
No. We can get started.

40:11.690 --> 40:12.690
Ok.

40:15.877 --> 40:16.877
Read the report.

40:17.317 --> 40:18.768
Yeah? What'd it say?

40:18.938 --> 40:19.938
Nothing new.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.446
No prints.
No forensics.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.190
Guardo was smart.

40:26.125 --> 40:26.938
He was careful.

40:26.939 --> 40:28.716
Not careful enough to escape us.

40:30.174 --> 40:31.376
No, not that.

40:33.817 --> 40:35.094
Guardo didn't kill Lem.

40:37.749 --> 40:42.727
I tortured him, shot him, and burned
his body, and he didn't kill Lem.

40:44.752 --> 40:46.363
We were right there with you.

40:46.641 --> 40:47.751
Yeah.

40:48.502 --> 40:49.502
I know.

40:51.754 --> 40:53.087
But Guardo didn't do it.

40:54.503 --> 40:57.818
Salvadorans, they wanted
to stay off our radar.

40:57.948 --> 41:01.143
They didn't even kill Emolia
when they found out that she'd snitched.

41:01.144 --> 41:03.131
Well, maybe some
salvadoran rogue banger...

41:03.132 --> 41:05.316
What, who killed Lem with a grenade,

41:05.567 --> 41:07.922
let no trace, and
disappeared like a ghost?

41:08.034 --> 41:09.255
I don't think so.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.571
It wasn't 1-9ers
looking for Antwon revenge.

41:14.219 --> 41:17.552
Made a fool of myself up
at Lompoc finding that one out.

41:26.128 --> 41:27.357
So I asked Ronnie

41:28.003 --> 41:31.503
to check if you logged all the grenades
that night at the bust.

41:33.626 --> 41:35.316
He counted 73 at the house,

41:35.911 --> 41:37.961
and there are 73 sitting there in the,

41:38.983 --> 41:41.073
bomb squad evidence locker right now.

41:45.505 --> 41:46.505
Which means...

41:49.505 --> 41:50.727
You pocketed a grenade

41:51.819 --> 41:54.930
before Aceveda even lied to us
about Lem ratting us out?

41:55.063 --> 41:59.301
You lied to us at the bust
about the count, you...

42:00.381 --> 42:03.351
Before I even started
to question Lem,

42:03.352 --> 42:05.153
you were looking
for a way to shut him up

42:05.264 --> 42:06.806
to make it look salvadoran?

42:06.880 --> 42:07.716
Don't even go there, man.

42:07.717 --> 42:10.283
You were the last one
to get to the meet.

42:10.497 --> 42:11.819
You couldn't lose your tail, right?

42:11.820 --> 42:13.413
- That's right.
- Well, did you try?

42:13.414 --> 42:14.361
As much as I could.

42:14.546 --> 42:16.404
I couldn't look too suspicious,
remember?

42:19.445 --> 42:21.167
Kavanaugh wrote another report.

42:22.318 --> 42:23.318
Part of his deal.

42:24.446 --> 42:26.168
He was short-handed that night.

42:26.757 --> 42:28.257
Just him and one other guy.

42:28.536 --> 42:30.105
Stop right there, Vic.

42:31.884 --> 42:33.416
There's nothing good
in where you're going...

42:33.417 --> 42:35.459
Just him and one other guy.

42:36.132 --> 42:38.412
So he followed me and Ronnie.

42:44.572 --> 42:45.683
So what? What did...

42:47.258 --> 42:48.513
You dropped a grenade in his lap?

42:48.514 --> 42:50.078
What did you do, just run?

42:53.070 --> 42:55.736
I did what I thought
had to be done at the time.

42:59.399 --> 43:00.399
Oh, God.

43:03.772 --> 43:04.772
I know, man.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.085
Oh, God.

43:06.271 --> 43:06.884
I know.

43:06.976 --> 43:08.295
- Oh...
- I know.

43:08.890 --> 43:09.577
Oh...

43:13.441 --> 43:15.014
You piece of shit!

43:15.367 --> 43:17.151
You made that decision
on your own?

43:17.152 --> 43:18.650
He wouldn't go to Mexico.

43:18.651 --> 43:19.587
Oh!

43:19.588 --> 43:21.310
I told him about the goat farm.

43:21.584 --> 43:22.584
About the way out.

43:23.710 --> 43:25.796
About the money that we
were going to send him.

43:25.944 --> 43:28.319
You said that if he wouldn't
take the ride to Mexico,

43:28.320 --> 43:29.604
that we would know that he turned.

43:29.605 --> 43:31.573
- He didn't turn!
- I know that now.

43:31.574 --> 43:34.396
We said that we would look him
in the eye and we would have the truth.

43:34.397 --> 43:35.623
And he never turned on us.

43:35.624 --> 43:38.047
We couldn't afford to take that chance.

43:39.072 --> 43:41.072
You think this has been easy for me?

43:41.269 --> 43:42.716
Carrying all this alone?

43:42.811 --> 43:44.501
For you? Lem!

43:44.705 --> 43:46.604
It was an impossible situation.

43:47.046 --> 43:49.319
At the time, it was either
him or the rest of us.

43:49.320 --> 43:50.320
Bullshit!

43:51.042 --> 43:53.689
Look, I was protecting
you and ronnie from it.

43:55.332 --> 43:57.040
Look, if he would have gone to jail
like he wanted,

43:57.041 --> 43:58.816
he would have been
killed by Antwon

43:59.243 --> 44:01.380
or turned by Kavanaugh.
Man, you know that.

44:01.565 --> 44:02.636
I don't know that.

44:03.181 --> 44:04.384
He was strong.

44:06.196 --> 44:08.196
You killed him because you were scared.

44:08.197 --> 44:09.967
He was strong and you were a coward!

44:10.097 --> 44:13.812
I was being strong for all of us,
and I am not a coward.

44:13.948 --> 44:15.946
Yeah, you were.
You were when you sat by

44:15.947 --> 44:19.002
and watched me tear Guardo
apart for something you did.

44:19.072 --> 44:20.759
Jesus Christ, what did you turn me into?

44:20.760 --> 44:21.911
He's an asshole murder.

44:21.912 --> 44:23.350
I'm not an executioner!

44:23.351 --> 44:25.032
Well, go tell that to Terry's family.

44:25.033 --> 44:26.199
That's different.

44:26.889 --> 44:28.822
That son of a bitch, he was a traitor.

44:28.823 --> 44:29.823
Lem was my friend.

44:30.009 --> 44:31.009
He was mine, too.

44:34.826 --> 44:37.198
Look, you think you're looking
at me through some window.

44:37.199 --> 44:39.327
And all you're really doing
is looking in a mirror.

44:39.328 --> 44:41.233
You and I, we're nothing alike.

44:41.457 --> 44:42.256
I would never...

44:42.257 --> 44:44.355
Oh, you did. More than once.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.755
So let's at least tell the truth now.

44:48.635 --> 44:49.635
Lem's gone.

44:51.860 --> 44:53.281
I would have spared Lem.

44:54.885 --> 44:56.483
And I stepped up and put Lem down

44:56.484 --> 44:59.311
so you could go to bed
at night believing that.

45:08.174 --> 45:09.609
You didn't come to me.

45:10.137 --> 45:12.799
You didn't talk to me.
We didn't decide, and now it's too late.

45:12.800 --> 45:13.949
There was no time.

45:13.950 --> 45:15.634
I didn't know if Kavanaugh
was going to swoop down

45:15.635 --> 45:16.689
and pick us up at any second.

45:16.690 --> 45:19.151
If you weren't sure...
If you weren't sure,

45:19.382 --> 45:22.577
you should have taken that chance
that he was still with us.

45:22.578 --> 45:24.075
You owed him that chance!

45:24.076 --> 45:27.827
I had to kill my friend,
and you know why.

45:28.904 --> 45:30.506
Look, it's taken me a while,

45:31.932 --> 45:34.512
but you're gonna learn
how to accept it, man.

45:34.607 --> 45:35.978
I will never accept that!

45:36.100 --> 45:37.649
I will never accept that!

45:38.887 --> 45:40.220
I'm not gonna fight you.

45:42.950 --> 45:44.283
I'm not gonna fight you.

45:49.264 --> 45:51.041
Ronnie's not even coming, is he?

45:51.459 --> 45:53.246
What, you told him you were
gonna look me in the eye,

45:53.247 --> 45:56.054
find out the truth?
Are you so god damn psychic?

45:56.720 --> 46:00.048
Why didn't you know
that Aceveda was lying about Lem, huh?

46:00.139 --> 46:01.416
I mean, all I was doing

46:01.763 --> 46:03.763
was following your game plan, coach.

46:04.888 --> 46:06.054
You killed my friend.

46:07.282 --> 46:10.229
Then you almost let
Kavanaugh send me away for it.

46:10.514 --> 46:12.012
I never would have let it come to that.

46:12.013 --> 46:13.235
You let me kill Guardo

46:13.639 --> 46:15.639
without opening your god damn mouth!

46:16.652 --> 46:19.012
I had the change to pull the
trigger on you once before.

46:19.013 --> 46:20.013
I didn't do it,

46:21.078 --> 46:22.648
and Lem lost his life because of it.

46:22.649 --> 46:24.237
Lem would have broken.

46:24.890 --> 46:25.945
I took it on myself

46:26.953 --> 46:29.453
the way that you took it off of us
for Terry.

46:29.841 --> 46:32.230
Vic, you're gonna learn
to be ok with it.

46:33.140 --> 46:34.828
Man, you just need a little time.

46:34.829 --> 46:36.717
You and me, we're all out of time.

46:43.328 --> 46:44.485
Lem's case is still open.

46:44.540 --> 46:46.751
I hope they catch you.
I hope they do.

46:47.204 --> 46:49.204
I hope everybody knows what you did.

46:49.641 --> 46:51.974
You don't get to do
what you did for free.

46:52.616 --> 46:53.898
You're gonna pay that bill.

46:55.272 --> 46:58.189
What, you gonna give Dutch
a little push in my direction?

46:59.747 --> 47:00.766
Well, maybe when they got me,

47:00.767 --> 47:03.329
they'll have a little time to look
into who killed Terry.

47:03.608 --> 47:06.330
That's old business,
and all you got is hearsay.

47:06.331 --> 47:08.219
Our entire lives are hearsay, Vic.

47:08.955 --> 47:10.288
All the shit we've done.

47:11.418 --> 47:13.944
And I've got a hell of a lot more
on you than you've got on me.

47:14.019 --> 47:15.871
Get in your truck. Drive away.

47:16.330 --> 47:17.827
Leave here before I kill you.

47:17.942 --> 47:20.339
No, you won't.
We've already been through all that.

47:20.561 --> 47:21.732
Before?

47:22.029 --> 47:24.444
You didn't blow lem
in half with a grenade.

47:26.194 --> 47:29.148
I see you again, I will kill you.

47:39.634 --> 47:41.076
God damn hypocrite.
