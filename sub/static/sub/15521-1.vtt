00:10.000 --> 00:15.500
greetings from roNy
300MBUNiTED

00:39.777 --> 00:42.302
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

00:43.580 --> 00:47.072
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

00:48.118 --> 00:50.450
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.</i>

00:51.255 --> 00:54.656
<i>Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses,
they'll know.</i>

00:57.895 --> 01:02.332
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

01:03.100 --> 01:06.069
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

01:06.170 --> 01:09.628
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

01:09.740 --> 01:11.731
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!</i>

01:11.842 --> 01:14.208
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

01:15.378 --> 01:16.811
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

01:19.082 --> 01:22.074
<i>I had heard it at least 14 times that night.</i>

01:22.752 --> 01:24.310
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

01:25.588 --> 01:28.489
<i>First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

01:28.658 --> 01:31.821
<i>There were certain institutions and people
that frowned upon it,</i>

01:31.928 --> 01:34.089
<i>but it's legal.</i>

01:34.197 --> 01:35.960
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

01:36.065 --> 01:38.226
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

01:38.501 --> 01:40.366
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

01:40.903 --> 01:43.497
<i>That's what got me into all this mess.</i>

01:44.073 --> 01:49.101
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over $640,000.</i>

01:50.980 --> 01:53.972
<i>All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.</i>

01:54.083 --> 01:56.813
<i>- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.</i>

01:56.919 --> 01:58.887
<i>Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.</i>

01:58.988 --> 02:00.979
<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

02:01.090 --> 02:03.251
<i>Folded arms, the table's hot.</i>

02:03.793 --> 02:06.819
<i>A touch to the eye, we need to talk.</i>

02:07.597 --> 02:12.694
<i>And a hand running through
perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.</i>

02:13.369 --> 02:15.030
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

02:25.348 --> 02:28.373
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

02:36.825 --> 02:41.489
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.299
Premed.

05:07.273 --> 05:08.831
4.0 GPA.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.000
44 MCATs.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.902
President, American Legion Math League.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.379
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.747
Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.878
And you're accepted early into school here
at Harvard Med,

05:22.989 --> 05:25.924
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

05:26.025 --> 05:26.992
Thank you.

05:27.093 --> 05:30.324
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.866
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.

05:33.967 --> 05:34.956
Absolutely.

05:35.068 --> 05:40.165
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship

05:40.273 --> 05:43.868
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

05:44.811 --> 05:45.971
Right.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.741
Professor Phillips?

05:49.015 --> 05:52.951
Some kids grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

05:53.052 --> 05:57.011
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.

05:57.557 --> 06:02.516
I grew up... Well, really,
I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.

06:03.629 --> 06:09.226
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.

06:09.868 --> 06:12.393
Which I don't really have.

06:14.773 --> 06:18.402
So, what I'm trying to say

06:18.510 --> 06:22.844
is that I really, really need this scholarship.

06:25.550 --> 06:27.279
Did you rehearse that?

06:27.386 --> 06:30.753
Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.

06:32.424 --> 06:35.791
Unfortunately,
desire doesn't figure into this much.

06:36.194 --> 06:41.029
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who

06:42.534 --> 06:43.796
dazzles.

06:44.936 --> 06:48.428
Somebody who just jumps off the page.

06:48.974 --> 06:53.343
Oh, well, then, I'm also involved
in a science competition.

06:53.445 --> 06:55.174
We're building a robotic wheel

06:55.280 --> 06:59.478
that can navigate itself
using a proprietary GPS system.

07:01.286 --> 07:03.686
Well, I'm designing the system. So...

07:03.789 --> 07:04.915
Right.

07:05.457 --> 07:08.857
Ben, last year,
the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,

07:08.959 --> 07:11.928
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.

07:13.397 --> 07:16.127
Well, I have both my legs.

07:16.233 --> 07:19.361
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?

07:20.671 --> 07:22.229
That was a joke.

07:23.674 --> 07:25.141
Ben, it's all about the essay.

07:25.242 --> 07:28.234
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

07:28.346 --> 07:31.679
What life experience separates you
from all the rest.

07:32.683 --> 07:34.275
Life experience.

07:34.852 --> 07:37.082
What can you tell me, Ben,

07:37.188 --> 07:39.816
that's going to dazzle me?

08:04.648 --> 08:05.672
I'm so sorry I'm late.

08:05.783 --> 08:09.048
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.

08:09.153 --> 08:12.714
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

08:12.823 --> 08:16.224
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?

08:16.327 --> 08:17.794
Eight dollars?

08:18.329 --> 08:23.163
Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren.
Thank you. Thank you.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.064
You slept with him, didn't you?

08:27.637 --> 08:30.128
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.868
I'll sleep with him, too,
and I'll get $8 an hour.

08:32.976 --> 08:36.104
So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?
And I say to him,

08:36.212 --> 08:39.943
"Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes

08:40.049 --> 08:42.142
"to get the kind of results
that you're looking for," okay?

08:42.252 --> 08:46.188
So then he says to me, "Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"

08:46.289 --> 08:51.386
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,

08:51.494 --> 08:54.759
"You can never have
enough capacitance probes."

08:57.400 --> 09:00.665
Oh, my God.
What the hell is wrong with you?

09:02.138 --> 09:03.503
Oh, nothing.

09:03.740 --> 09:07.107
I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man.
You should be happy.

09:07.210 --> 09:12.341
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.

09:13.383 --> 09:17.479
And the reason that I have nothing
is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.

09:17.587 --> 09:20.283
- Oh, give me a break, Ben.
- What?

09:20.390 --> 09:22.119
You have everything.

09:22.525 --> 09:26.985
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?

09:27.096 --> 09:28.358
Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.

09:28.465 --> 09:30.728
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.

09:31.433 --> 09:33.765
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.

09:33.869 --> 09:37.236
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

09:37.339 --> 09:40.240
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.

09:40.342 --> 09:42.310
Man, I gave up everything.

09:42.678 --> 09:45.078
You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.841
I don't think you gave up sex.

09:46.949 --> 09:49.179
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.979
All right, all right. Not sex, but...

09:51.086 --> 09:53.077
It just annoys me that the one thing

09:53.188 --> 09:56.123
that is stopping me
from going to Harvard Med is money.

09:56.225 --> 10:00.457
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over $300,000.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.355
$300,000.

10:03.465 --> 10:06.764
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high.
I get that.

10:06.869 --> 10:10.771
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.

10:13.175 --> 10:15.336
Well, look at the bright side,

10:15.844 --> 10:19.007
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

10:29.258 --> 10:30.418
Thank you.

10:33.228 --> 10:35.287
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.

10:35.397 --> 10:36.694
Thank you, love. Kisses.

10:36.798 --> 10:38.026
Make a wish.

10:38.133 --> 10:39.430
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

10:41.369 --> 10:42.768
Bravo.

10:42.870 --> 10:44.201
Congratulations, Benjamin.

10:44.305 --> 10:47.103
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?

10:47.208 --> 10:50.371
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

10:50.478 --> 10:53.470
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.

10:53.581 --> 10:55.105
Cam, you owe another six bucks.

10:55.216 --> 10:56.843
No, no. I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.

10:56.951 --> 10:59.419
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.784
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.

11:01.889 --> 11:04.915
I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

11:05.026 --> 11:08.223
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

11:08.329 --> 11:11.264
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

11:11.365 --> 11:14.732
So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night,

11:14.835 --> 11:17.201
after 19 cups of coffee.

11:17.305 --> 11:20.331
- Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

11:20.541 --> 11:23.601
This is good. Miles, this is good.

11:23.711 --> 11:28.944
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.381
This is called destiny.

11:30.484 --> 11:32.281
You know, there is the... Thank you.

11:32.386 --> 11:36.049
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

11:36.157 --> 11:39.558
Oh, yeah?
Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!

11:39.660 --> 11:41.958
Look, guys,

11:44.098 --> 11:48.694
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.

11:49.370 --> 11:53.362
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.809
If we can't even win that, what's the point?

11:59.346 --> 12:01.314
Hey, hey. Look at this!

12:01.848 --> 12:03.509
No, no, no, no.

12:09.155 --> 12:10.816
We suck.

12:17.664 --> 12:20.428
Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.

12:22.135 --> 12:23.227
Yeah.

12:25.138 --> 12:27.606
Do you remember anything about him?

12:29.042 --> 12:32.375
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?

12:33.246 --> 12:35.612
Yeah, I think I watched him shave.

12:37.884 --> 12:40.614
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?

12:40.720 --> 12:44.451
I don't know. I'll probably just go back
and work on that essay.

12:44.557 --> 12:46.525
Ben, you're working too hard.

12:46.626 --> 12:51.325
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just yourself.

12:51.898 --> 12:55.231
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.

12:55.335 --> 12:59.362
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

12:59.472 --> 13:01.702
Okay. All right.

13:03.475 --> 13:04.669
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

13:04.777 --> 13:07.644
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

13:12.518 --> 13:13.712
All right.

13:13.819 --> 13:18.415
Now, who can explain Newton's method
and how you use it?

13:19.425 --> 13:22.417
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.

13:24.296 --> 13:27.754
That's impressive. That's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,

13:27.866 --> 13:31.358
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

13:32.237 --> 13:35.695
All right, now somebody tell me something
I don't already know.

13:35.808 --> 13:36.934
Anyone?

13:37.042 --> 13:39.602
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.

13:40.245 --> 13:41.837
Newton stole it.

13:42.848 --> 13:44.941
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

13:46.318 --> 13:50.220
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

13:50.889 --> 13:55.258
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then it fails.

13:55.561 --> 13:59.156
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.

13:59.264 --> 14:00.288
Ben.

14:00.399 --> 14:03.232
So Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

14:03.335 --> 14:05.030
was the original author of this method.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.230
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?

14:07.339 --> 14:10.570
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.

14:10.776 --> 14:14.040
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson

14:14.145 --> 14:18.707
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

14:18.816 --> 14:22.013
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?

14:22.120 --> 14:26.523
We're gonna call this
the game show host problem, all right?

14:26.624 --> 14:28.649
Ben, suppose you're on a game show.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.252
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?

14:32.363 --> 14:37.266
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.

14:37.368 --> 14:39.768
Which door would you choose, Ben?

14:40.204 --> 14:41.228
Door number one?

14:41.339 --> 14:43.136
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

14:43.241 --> 14:45.232
All right, now, the game show host,

14:45.343 --> 14:48.312
who, by the way,
knows what's behind all the other doors,

14:48.412 --> 14:52.610
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

14:52.784 --> 14:56.618
Behind which sits a goat. Now...

14:56.721 --> 14:58.518
Ben, game show host comes up to you.

14:58.623 --> 15:01.023
He says, "Ben, do you want to stay
with door number one

15:01.125 --> 15:02.456
"or go with door number two?"

15:02.560 --> 15:06.018
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?

15:06.697 --> 15:08.221
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.

15:08.332 --> 15:10.425
Remember, the host knows where the car is

15:10.535 --> 15:12.969
so how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

15:13.070 --> 15:15.937
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

15:16.040 --> 15:20.272
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.346
Based on variable change.

15:23.513 --> 15:25.879
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.

15:25.982 --> 15:28.246
Yeah, which changed everything.

15:28.518 --> 15:29.883
Enlighten us.

15:29.986 --> 15:33.251
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,

15:33.356 --> 15:36.814
I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.

15:37.360 --> 15:41.023
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,

15:41.131 --> 15:45.329
it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch.

15:45.435 --> 15:51.135
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3%.

15:53.743 --> 15:54.869
Exactly.

15:54.978 --> 15:56.172
People, remember,

15:56.279 --> 16:00.511
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.

16:00.617 --> 16:02.710
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch

16:02.819 --> 16:06.311
out of paranoia, fear, emotions.

16:06.423 --> 16:09.324
But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside

16:09.726 --> 16:16.256
and let simple math get his ass
into a brand-new car!

16:17.500 --> 16:19.627
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

16:19.736 --> 16:20.794
All right, everybody.

16:20.904 --> 16:22.303
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

16:22.405 --> 16:23.963
Your graded papers are down here
at the end.

16:24.074 --> 16:26.599
You can pick them up on your way out.

16:37.019 --> 16:38.680
I am invincible.

16:45.628 --> 16:48.119
Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.

17:02.912 --> 17:04.743
Man. That's brutal.

17:07.016 --> 17:09.849
You know,
you should just ask her out, man.

17:09.952 --> 17:12.443
It's not like she's a rocket scientist
or anything.

17:12.554 --> 17:14.146
Oh, wait, she is.

17:14.256 --> 17:16.315
Well, why don't you ask her?

17:16.492 --> 17:20.087
Because I'm already dating someone.

17:20.496 --> 17:22.987
Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.

17:23.098 --> 17:26.397
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

17:28.137 --> 17:32.096
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.

17:33.842 --> 17:35.605
Yeah, that's funny.

17:37.279 --> 17:40.544
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?

17:40.916 --> 17:45.249
Well, I'd say getting down with that
would definitely qualify.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.248
Cam!

18:08.543 --> 18:09.942
Boy genius.

18:10.878 --> 18:12.869
You have to follow me now.

18:13.348 --> 18:15.942
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

18:16.985 --> 18:18.145
Come on.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.526
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

18:44.712 --> 18:46.407
Our honored guest.

18:48.449 --> 18:50.212
- How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.

18:50.318 --> 18:53.082
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.

18:53.888 --> 18:56.185
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.

18:56.289 --> 18:58.780
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.

19:02.863 --> 19:04.956
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.

19:05.599 --> 19:07.965
Is there a problem with my paper?

19:08.068 --> 19:11.265
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton

19:11.371 --> 19:15.000
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.

19:15.108 --> 19:20.102
Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

19:21.014 --> 19:23.574
So, is this some kind of a math club?

19:24.751 --> 19:26.514
Don't be rude, people.

19:26.620 --> 19:29.214
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

19:29.322 --> 19:30.914
- Choi.
- Jill.

19:33.693 --> 19:37.857
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.

19:38.265 --> 19:40.392
No, really? Well, it's really simple, actually.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.593
You play against the dealer.

19:43.336 --> 19:44.860
You're given two cards.

19:44.971 --> 19:47.235
Face cards are worth 10 points.

19:47.340 --> 19:49.399
The closest to 21 wins.

19:49.643 --> 19:53.374
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.

19:54.815 --> 19:57.716
It's the most popular card game
in the world.

19:57.818 --> 19:59.046
It's a game with memory.

19:59.152 --> 20:01.848
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.

20:01.955 --> 20:04.685
And the best part, it's beatable.

20:06.959 --> 20:09.154
Are you talking about counting cards?

20:09.261 --> 20:13.857
No. I'm talking about getting very, very rich.

20:16.535 --> 20:19.527
You count cards, right? All of you?

20:19.638 --> 20:21.128
As a team, yes.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.898
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

20:26.278 --> 20:28.508
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.

20:30.216 --> 20:32.309
So, why are you telling me?

20:33.486 --> 20:36.250
Well, let's just say a spot opened up
on our roster.

20:36.355 --> 20:37.379
How?

20:38.090 --> 20:40.081
Jimmy got a job at Google.

20:40.192 --> 20:43.628
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.

20:43.863 --> 20:46.559
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?

20:46.665 --> 20:48.963
Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.

20:50.402 --> 20:52.063
Yeah... This is crazy.

20:52.171 --> 20:54.867
No, Ben. This is profitable.

20:57.643 --> 21:00.407
Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.

21:00.513 --> 21:04.449
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.

21:04.550 --> 21:06.108
No, it's not that. It's...

21:06.218 --> 21:11.155
I just got a promotion at my job,
so it's kind of not a good time for me.

21:11.257 --> 21:12.724
We pay better.

21:13.526 --> 21:16.154
Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.

21:16.262 --> 21:19.890
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.

21:19.998 --> 21:22.159
I mean, what do you have to worry about?

21:22.267 --> 21:26.328
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

21:27.906 --> 21:31.967
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.

21:32.343 --> 21:34.573
You know, the 2.09 Competition?

21:35.547 --> 21:38.778
Wait, no.
I'm building a car that drives by itself.

21:38.883 --> 21:41.716
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,

21:41.819 --> 21:43.844
so it's kind of important.

21:43.955 --> 21:47.789
Ben, let the car drive by itself.

21:50.028 --> 21:55.989
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also composed.

21:57.268 --> 22:00.726
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

22:02.106 --> 22:05.007
Ben, you were born for this.

22:05.476 --> 22:08.206
You'll have more fun
than you've ever had in your entire life.

22:08.313 --> 22:09.712
It's perfect.

22:11.015 --> 22:15.418
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.

22:16.487 --> 22:17.920
So I'm sorry.

22:24.796 --> 22:25.922
Ben.

22:26.798 --> 22:29.664
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.461
- No, of...
- No.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.729
You're one of my favorite new students,

22:33.837 --> 22:37.068
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.

22:43.647 --> 22:45.979
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.

22:46.083 --> 22:48.916
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?

22:49.553 --> 22:51.214
So, how much is this thing gonna run me?

22:51.321 --> 22:56.520
Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95,
minus 15%.

22:56.627 --> 22:59.289
The jacket's $589.99.

22:59.396 --> 23:02.957
The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both.

23:03.066 --> 23:07.332
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99.

23:07.437 --> 23:09.564
The shoes were just marked down
from $155,

23:09.673 --> 23:15.236
so you're looking at $1,042.68.

23:18.448 --> 23:20.712
I'm pretty good with numbers.

23:21.918 --> 23:24.045
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

23:24.154 --> 23:26.452
Yeah, so let me know
when I can ring that up for you guys.

23:26.556 --> 23:27.691
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

23:27.691 --> 23:28.453
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

23:33.764 --> 23:34.788
Hey.

23:37.567 --> 23:38.590
Hey.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.736
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

23:43.539 --> 23:45.871
I'm looking for a tie.

23:45.975 --> 23:50.378
Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale
on the ties.

23:51.614 --> 23:55.106
And if you want,
I could probably get you an additional 10%

23:55.217 --> 23:57.242
with my employee discount.

23:58.387 --> 24:00.855
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

24:02.391 --> 24:07.556
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,

24:07.663 --> 24:11.724
you know, to repel liquids and stains.

24:11.834 --> 24:16.362
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.

24:17.039 --> 24:19.007
Face me. Stay still.

24:21.043 --> 24:24.410
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,

24:26.082 --> 24:30.075
I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.

24:32.655 --> 24:34.282
I came to see you.

24:35.591 --> 24:36.785
You did?

24:39.061 --> 24:40.392
Blackjack's a great game.

24:40.496 --> 24:42.123
No, look, it's easy to learn

24:42.231 --> 24:46.031
and there's really not as much strategy to it
as people think.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.226
I grew up on it, actually.

24:48.838 --> 24:51.772
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

24:52.807 --> 24:56.106
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.

24:56.344 --> 24:59.836
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.

25:00.882 --> 25:03.442
If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.

25:03.551 --> 25:05.416
And what if he won?

25:07.555 --> 25:09.045
He'd still take me out for ice cream.

25:09.157 --> 25:12.490
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.861
Ben, you should feel the thrill

25:18.366 --> 25:22.063
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

25:28.076 --> 25:30.306
I think you should come to Vegas.

25:30.412 --> 25:34.815
'Cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

25:40.555 --> 25:41.749
I can't.

25:42.557 --> 25:43.956
I'm sorry.

25:45.059 --> 25:46.492
I just can't.

25:48.229 --> 25:52.063
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.

25:52.767 --> 25:53.927
Yeah.

25:54.702 --> 25:56.567
You're welcome any time.

26:01.575 --> 26:04.442
You know,
I think the best thing about Vegas

26:05.145 --> 26:07.613
is you can become anyone you want.

26:37.144 --> 26:38.338
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

26:38.445 --> 26:39.412
- No.
- Plus 11.

26:39.513 --> 26:40.502
No.

26:40.814 --> 26:43.647
- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me "dude."

26:43.750 --> 26:45.149
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

26:45.252 --> 26:48.415
People, please. We had a total of 76 cards
that came out of the deck.

26:48.522 --> 26:50.649
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

26:50.757 --> 26:52.850
Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,

26:52.960 --> 26:54.689
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

26:54.795 --> 26:57.423
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

26:59.900 --> 27:02.460
The count. It's plus 13.

27:05.939 --> 27:07.031
Yes.

27:08.208 --> 27:09.800
Pull up a chair.

27:17.483 --> 27:18.575
Stop.

27:19.352 --> 27:22.116
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

27:22.221 --> 27:24.189
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

27:24.524 --> 27:26.583
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

27:26.692 --> 27:27.750
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

27:27.860 --> 27:28.827
Cat.

27:30.296 --> 27:31.661
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

27:31.931 --> 27:34.024
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

27:34.133 --> 27:38.229
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

27:38.337 --> 27:39.827
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

27:39.939 --> 27:43.204
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.

27:44.544 --> 27:47.012
<i>I was studying all day, every day.</i>

27:47.113 --> 27:51.573
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

27:51.684 --> 27:54.744
<i>used in ways I could never have imagined.</i>

27:56.722 --> 27:58.519
<i>The team had a system.</i>

27:58.891 --> 28:02.292
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

28:03.563 --> 28:06.657
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

28:06.933 --> 28:08.400
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

28:08.501 --> 28:09.525
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

28:09.635 --> 28:11.432
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

28:11.771 --> 28:13.033
Plus 12.

28:13.139 --> 28:15.232
Is this chemistry review?

28:20.079 --> 28:21.636
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

28:21.746 --> 28:22.872
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

28:22.981 --> 28:24.346
Use it in a sentence.

28:24.449 --> 28:26.713
Man, that sugar's sweet.

28:28.286 --> 28:31.915
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

28:32.023 --> 28:33.547
<i>That's how I knew what to bet.</i>

28:33.658 --> 28:35.353
You're doing great.

28:36.728 --> 28:41.427
Micky, I just want to let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,

28:41.533 --> 28:43.558
which is $300,000.

28:43.668 --> 28:47.331
I mean, if I can get anything close to that,
then I'm done.

28:47.606 --> 28:50.871
Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not "if," it's "when."

28:50.976 --> 28:53.638
And second of all,
I get it. I completely understand.

28:53.745 --> 28:56.373
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

28:56.481 --> 28:59.746
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,

28:59.851 --> 29:03.218
so who knows how long this gig's
gonna last for any of us?

29:03.321 --> 29:05.050
What if we get caught?

29:05.156 --> 29:08.216
Our system keeps us under the radar,
you'll see.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.988
Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.

29:11.896 --> 29:16.356
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.

29:20.271 --> 29:22.637
You think you can beat the system?

29:23.575 --> 29:27.409
This is the system, beating you back.

29:30.181 --> 29:33.308
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.

29:35.452 --> 29:37.716
- Get him up.
- Come on, kid.

29:37.821 --> 29:39.379
Count to five.

29:40.524 --> 29:43.186
- Count to five!
- What?

29:43.494 --> 29:46.930
Count to five so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.

29:47.031 --> 29:48.157
Start with one.

29:48.265 --> 29:50.859
One, two, three, four, five.

29:50.968 --> 29:55.166
Good. Now, stop counting.

29:58.842 --> 30:00.070
Let's go.

30:04.281 --> 30:06.215
<i>You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.</i>

30:06.316 --> 30:07.374
<i>My grandmother splits eights.</i>

30:07.484 --> 30:10.044
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.

30:10.154 --> 30:11.781
Look, you're choosing to play two hands

30:11.889 --> 30:14.414
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?

30:14.525 --> 30:16.550
Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.

30:16.660 --> 30:18.719
Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.

30:18.829 --> 30:21.457
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?

30:21.565 --> 30:23.863
Choi, why don't you explain to Ben
how we do?

30:23.967 --> 30:25.332
Oh, all right.

30:25.436 --> 30:28.872
So, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,

30:28.972 --> 30:30.701
spotters and big players, right?

30:30.808 --> 30:34.266
So if you think that this table
is the casino floor,

30:35.913 --> 30:38.177
then salt and pepper shakers
are your spotters.

30:38.282 --> 30:41.080
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

30:41.185 --> 30:44.517
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

30:44.620 --> 30:47.612
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

30:47.724 --> 30:50.454
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.

30:50.560 --> 30:53.620
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,

30:53.730 --> 30:56.290
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

30:56.399 --> 30:58.128
Right. And then when one of the decks
gets hot,

30:58.234 --> 31:00.725
the spotter at that table signals
in the big player.

31:00.837 --> 31:03.271
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.

31:03.372 --> 31:05.431
Well, I'm always the mustard, so...

31:05.541 --> 31:09.705
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,

31:09.812 --> 31:13.714
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.

31:13.816 --> 31:16.512
So the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

31:16.619 --> 31:18.814
When the deck cools, he cashes in.

31:18.921 --> 31:20.411
It's not as easy as it sounds.

31:20.523 --> 31:21.956
Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,

31:22.058 --> 31:24.686
because if Grey Poupon over here
ever loses the count,

31:24.794 --> 31:27.627
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

31:27.730 --> 31:30.324
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.

31:30.566 --> 31:31.624
Show us.

31:31.734 --> 31:33.133
Okay, what's this?

31:33.236 --> 31:35.636
- The deck's hot.
- Right.

31:35.738 --> 31:37.603
We need to talk.

31:38.608 --> 31:40.269
The deck's cooling.

31:41.410 --> 31:43.537
And get out. Get out now.

31:45.214 --> 31:49.344
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

31:50.553 --> 31:52.316
There's a trial run?

31:53.054 --> 31:55.716
- Where?
- You'll find out.

32:46.741 --> 32:47.867
Hey.

33:05.559 --> 33:07.356
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

33:07.728 --> 33:09.025
Follow me.

33:17.304 --> 33:18.566
This way.

33:26.013 --> 33:28.208
Go, go. You go.

33:42.429 --> 33:45.193
No more bet. No more bet.

33:50.671 --> 33:52.229
Come on, money.

33:52.339 --> 33:54.136
Today, 14.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.004
Whose side are you on?

34:04.385 --> 34:05.545
Sixteen.

34:05.653 --> 34:07.746
Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.

34:10.357 --> 34:13.520
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?

34:22.502 --> 34:25.994
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.

34:26.205 --> 34:27.365
$300.

34:37.650 --> 34:38.810
$300.

34:40.086 --> 34:41.553
You bet, sir?

34:43.423 --> 34:44.685
Thanks.

35:04.277 --> 35:06.507
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

35:06.679 --> 35:10.581
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner." All right.

35:13.653 --> 35:14.915
Nice.

35:19.058 --> 35:21.356
Can I get another drink, please?

35:21.661 --> 35:22.958
Thank you.

35:25.731 --> 35:27.562
What the hell are you doing?

35:27.666 --> 35:30.794
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

35:30.902 --> 35:32.529
Get off, I haven't done anything!

35:34.606 --> 35:36.267
Please. Please let go.

35:36.375 --> 35:38.172
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.

35:38.276 --> 35:40.642
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!

35:40.746 --> 35:42.304
What's the count?

35:44.816 --> 35:46.408
Plus 18.

35:51.690 --> 35:53.248
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

35:53.358 --> 35:54.518
Congratulations, Ben.

35:54.626 --> 35:56.856
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.

35:56.962 --> 35:58.725
Welcome to the team.

36:00.198 --> 36:01.426
We didn't mean it.

36:01.533 --> 36:04.468
It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag.

36:12.844 --> 36:16.041
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

36:16.148 --> 36:18.446
I want you to take Jimmy's place.

36:19.618 --> 36:20.983
I've never done this.

36:21.086 --> 36:22.314
I know that and I understand.

36:22.421 --> 36:25.549
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.

36:25.657 --> 36:27.818
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,

36:27.926 --> 36:29.723
and I've never had a student
as impressive as you.

36:29.828 --> 36:32.058
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.

36:32.164 --> 36:34.689
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

36:34.800 --> 36:37.632
'Cause you remind me of myself
25 years ago.

36:38.869 --> 36:40.029
You in?

36:41.238 --> 36:44.639
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.

36:45.509 --> 36:48.740
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.

36:51.582 --> 36:54.346
We're counting cards, we're not gambling.

36:54.585 --> 36:57.679
We're following a specific set of rules
and playing a system.

36:57.788 --> 36:58.777
Right.

36:58.889 --> 37:00.914
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,

37:01.025 --> 37:03.926
and sometimes, people lose control.

37:04.361 --> 37:06.522
They give in to their emotions.

37:07.798 --> 37:09.231
You will not.

37:10.468 --> 37:11.992
You understand?

37:13.137 --> 37:14.161
Yeah.

37:15.606 --> 37:17.073
Get some rest.

37:17.708 --> 37:19.733
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

37:19.844 --> 37:23.473
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy
paper due Tuesday.

37:23.914 --> 37:26.007
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

37:26.117 --> 37:27.982
No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.

37:28.085 --> 37:30.246
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,

37:30.354 --> 37:32.982
and he understood, so he gave you an A.

37:34.191 --> 37:37.683
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.

37:37.795 --> 37:40.389
You'll get a call about details later.

37:43.134 --> 37:44.567
So did the girls go on ahead, huh?

37:44.668 --> 37:46.999
Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags
to check, you know?

37:47.103 --> 37:48.161
Okay.

37:48.271 --> 37:51.172
Well, wait for us by security
'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.

37:51.274 --> 37:52.366
No, I'm good.

37:52.475 --> 37:54.807
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.

37:54.911 --> 37:57.778
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.

38:00.917 --> 38:02.646
Honestly, I really don't have to go.

38:02.752 --> 38:05.152
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I really don't have to...

38:05.255 --> 38:06.313
Please just shut up.

38:06.422 --> 38:08.652
Why are you looking over there?
Look, I don't...

38:08.758 --> 38:10.851
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.155
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

38:14.364 --> 38:16.594
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.329
Don't ask questions.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.165
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

38:24.274 --> 38:27.607
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.

38:29.379 --> 38:32.439
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

38:32.549 --> 38:34.676
And we're not about
to have them confiscate $250,000.

38:34.784 --> 38:36.513
$250,000?

38:36.953 --> 38:40.582
- No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

38:41.224 --> 38:43.886
You really suck at not asking questions.

38:48.198 --> 38:49.927
What's a donkey boy?

38:51.534 --> 38:53.832
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.

38:55.271 --> 38:58.000
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.

38:58.106 --> 39:01.735
Act casual, think casual, be casual.

39:01.843 --> 39:04.539
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.

39:04.646 --> 39:05.977
Thank you.

39:07.449 --> 39:11.545
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.712
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:42.017 --> 39:43.006
Your boarding pass.

39:57.032 --> 39:58.056
Sir?

40:10.678 --> 40:12.407
You forgot your bag.

40:14.915 --> 40:16.212
Thanks.

42:15.802 --> 42:17.463
Nice going, Campbell.

42:17.570 --> 42:22.234
Hey, Ben.
Basic strategy says you should hit that.

42:33.752 --> 42:37.449
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,

42:37.556 --> 42:40.753
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.

42:40.859 --> 42:42.850
So glad you could make it.

42:43.095 --> 42:44.960
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

42:45.063 --> 42:47.361
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

42:47.466 --> 42:48.626
You live in Washington, D.C.

42:48.734 --> 42:52.500
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.

42:52.604 --> 42:54.868
- I don't like my name.
- Why not?

42:55.474 --> 42:58.068
"Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?

42:58.177 --> 43:00.372
Well, you have a lot of clever outfits.
You'll figure it out.

43:00.479 --> 43:03.642
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

43:03.749 --> 43:06.946
You know, I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?

43:07.052 --> 43:09.282
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.

43:09.388 --> 43:12.084
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

43:12.191 --> 43:14.455
and it allows everyone to be different people
in different casinos.

43:14.560 --> 43:18.587
Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell.
That's the way it works.

43:19.031 --> 43:20.396
Like I'm not going already.

43:20.499 --> 43:21.591
Yeah. All right. Now, listen.

43:21.700 --> 43:24.635
Ben, this is for you.
All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.101
They're called "eyes in the sky."

43:26.205 --> 43:29.140
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,

43:29.241 --> 43:31.732
and at all times, you don't know each other.

43:31.844 --> 43:36.144
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.

43:37.382 --> 43:38.474
And what's our motto?

43:38.584 --> 43:40.517
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.313
Thank you very much.

43:43.387 --> 43:44.945
How come you don't play?

43:45.056 --> 43:48.253
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.

43:48.359 --> 43:51.260
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.

43:51.362 --> 43:52.954
Welcome to Vegas.

44:03.207 --> 44:04.333
No more bets.

44:04.442 --> 44:06.273
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.

44:06.377 --> 44:09.437
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?

44:09.547 --> 44:12.277
Oh, see,
now that sounds really complicated.

44:12.383 --> 44:14.544
- I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

44:14.652 --> 44:17.314
Here to double my family's inheritance.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.580
I don't know.

44:40.344 --> 44:41.811
$10,000.

44:42.813 --> 44:44.713
Changing $10,000.

44:44.815 --> 44:46.680
Sweet. Too sweet.

45:07.370 --> 45:09.964
<i>Eight. The count's still plus 16.</i>

45:11.575 --> 45:13.543
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

45:13.877 --> 45:15.504
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

45:16.913 --> 45:19.507
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

45:21.084 --> 45:23.052
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

45:25.055 --> 45:27.683
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

45:29.326 --> 45:31.089
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

45:31.394 --> 45:32.418
Can I split those?

45:32.529 --> 45:35.521
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.

45:42.739 --> 45:45.264
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

45:48.645 --> 45:51.011
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

45:57.220 --> 46:00.087
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

46:07.096 --> 46:08.586
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

46:09.632 --> 46:11.657
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

46:12.134 --> 46:13.499
<i>Blackjack.</i>

46:59.314 --> 47:00.713
Monkey! Monkey!

47:00.816 --> 47:02.716
- So what's a monkey?
- Face card.

47:02.818 --> 47:06.219
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.

47:09.758 --> 47:10.918
Monkey!

47:11.293 --> 47:12.691
Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!

47:12.794 --> 47:15.957
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.

47:16.064 --> 47:17.554
Monkey! Monkey!

47:20.868 --> 47:22.733
All right, all right.

47:26.274 --> 47:28.469
Oh, God.

47:29.610 --> 47:31.134
I need to quit.

47:36.017 --> 47:38.110
Could I color up, please?

48:21.028 --> 48:22.393
Nice undies.

48:28.935 --> 48:30.960
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

48:31.071 --> 48:32.902
We split it five ways.

48:38.145 --> 48:39.840
So, what do you think?

48:39.946 --> 48:41.573
Yeah, it was fun.

48:42.015 --> 48:43.482
- You were good.
- Really?

48:43.583 --> 48:47.019
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

48:47.120 --> 48:51.079
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.

48:52.893 --> 48:55.384
And you made more money than Fisher.

48:55.662 --> 48:58.222
I was pretty nervous, actually.

48:58.865 --> 49:02.301
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of easy.

49:04.104 --> 49:05.628
Not for everyone.

49:05.739 --> 49:07.866
Yeah, it's just simple math.

49:08.441 --> 49:11.342
Good.
We can do some serious damage with you.

49:16.750 --> 49:19.082
Here's the thing I told Micky.

49:19.486 --> 49:23.684
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.

49:23.790 --> 49:26.452
You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.

49:28.995 --> 49:31.122
That's what they all say.

49:31.898 --> 49:35.526
No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this
to pay for Harvard.

49:35.634 --> 49:38.102
It's just a means to an end for me.

49:39.972 --> 49:41.439
I believe you.

49:41.907 --> 49:42.999
Good.

49:53.219 --> 49:56.279
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

49:58.090 --> 49:59.079
Team meeting.

49:59.558 --> 50:00.786
Hello?

50:00.893 --> 50:02.155
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:02.528 --> 50:03.995
Where's everybody else?

50:04.096 --> 50:06.860
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.

50:10.836 --> 50:12.963
Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.

50:13.339 --> 50:17.799
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

50:18.310 --> 50:21.939
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.

50:22.481 --> 50:26.918
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

50:27.953 --> 50:29.420
Where's Kianna?

50:29.722 --> 50:30.882
Slots.

50:32.157 --> 50:36.355
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.

50:37.162 --> 50:39.392
I've been busy this morning.

50:42.801 --> 50:44.199
All right, guys, let's get something clear.

50:44.302 --> 50:46.532
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

50:46.638 --> 50:49.038
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.

50:49.140 --> 50:51.131
Kianna, slots are for losers.

50:51.242 --> 50:53.403
Fisher, peelers are stealers.

50:53.711 --> 50:54.769
Choi?

50:55.079 --> 50:59.243
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens

50:59.350 --> 51:03.150
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

51:03.254 --> 51:07.315
But, Fisher,
what the hell were you up to last night?

51:07.692 --> 51:08.716
What?

51:08.826 --> 51:11.818
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,

51:11.930 --> 51:13.124
but you kept on anyway.

51:13.231 --> 51:14.823
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

51:14.933 --> 51:16.867
In either case,
I don't wanna see it happen again.

51:16.968 --> 51:18.833
Jill, nice disguise last night.

51:18.937 --> 51:23.601
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.

51:24.676 --> 51:25.665
Beginner's luck.

51:25.777 --> 51:28.769
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man, lose like a man.

51:29.347 --> 51:31.406
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.

51:31.516 --> 51:32.847
You know what's worse than a loser?

51:32.951 --> 51:36.182
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

51:36.287 --> 51:38.152
Take it up with Ida.

51:39.357 --> 51:40.585
Who's Ida?

51:41.526 --> 51:43.084
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

51:43.194 --> 51:45.185
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

52:12.122 --> 52:14.113
There goes that paycheck.

52:22.065 --> 52:24.966
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.

52:28.205 --> 52:30.139
How's she doing?

52:30.540 --> 52:31.837
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.

52:31.942 --> 52:34.843
The way I see it, yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery.

52:34.945 --> 52:37.743
It's all what you do in the moment, baby.

52:49.893 --> 52:51.952
Just lost another property.

52:53.030 --> 52:56.431
- Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
- Caesars.

52:58.035 --> 53:00.094
That was a 14-year account.

53:00.437 --> 53:04.373
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.

53:05.008 --> 53:09.967
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.

53:10.079 --> 53:12.877
Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.

53:13.082 --> 53:16.518
By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?

53:17.987 --> 53:20.979
There's no smoking in here, you know that.

53:27.129 --> 53:28.653
I appreciate it.

53:35.337 --> 53:37.305
End of an era, my friend.

53:46.549 --> 53:48.380
Ben. Time for school.

53:52.221 --> 53:54.382
I seem to keep waking up to you.

53:54.490 --> 53:56.151
Don't get used to it.

54:15.144 --> 54:17.634
I'm glad you came over this morning.

54:18.780 --> 54:21.749
- I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?

54:24.219 --> 54:26.244
I want you to have this.

54:26.955 --> 54:28.217
What's this?

54:33.828 --> 54:35.659
That's a lot of money.

54:36.164 --> 54:39.793
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

54:39.901 --> 54:44.235
I know it won't pay the whole way,
but it should help.

54:45.540 --> 54:48.407
Ma, I can't take this.

54:48.910 --> 54:51.037
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

54:51.146 --> 54:55.947
For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay
for med school, Dr. Campbell.

55:02.123 --> 55:03.988
Well, you know what? You don't have to.

55:04.092 --> 55:07.528
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.

55:08.296 --> 55:10.821
Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.

55:11.366 --> 55:15.166
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.

55:15.270 --> 55:17.465
And actually, I just found out today.

55:17.572 --> 55:20.735
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

55:21.042 --> 55:24.307
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.

55:29.116 --> 55:32.313
- I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.

55:32.419 --> 55:36.913
So, listen, you keep this, all right?
It's yours.

56:15.996 --> 56:17.657
What are you doing?

56:18.765 --> 56:22.633
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.

56:26.473 --> 56:28.737
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

56:28.842 --> 56:31.333
- No. Not really, never.
- No.

56:32.346 --> 56:33.472
Right.

56:36.750 --> 56:37.909
All right.

56:38.017 --> 56:40.451
So where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.

56:40.553 --> 56:44.216
Oh, yeah? I ended up
having to go to New Hampshire

56:44.323 --> 56:46.723
to help my cousin move.

56:46.826 --> 56:48.760
You didn't bring your cell phone?

56:48.861 --> 56:51.591
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

56:51.697 --> 56:56.999
No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here.
So, you know.

56:57.103 --> 56:59.469
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.

56:59.572 --> 57:00.800
Oh, yeah?

57:00.906 --> 57:03.136
We almost had a girl there.

57:06.012 --> 57:08.674
- Republik?
- Yes.

57:09.181 --> 57:10.205
Let's do it!

57:19.592 --> 57:21.116
She is an eight.

57:21.460 --> 57:25.897
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

57:25.998 --> 57:28.967
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.

57:29.068 --> 57:30.592
That's right.

57:31.470 --> 57:35.406
But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.

57:43.649 --> 57:46.482
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.

57:53.491 --> 57:55.891
Hey. Can I get you a beer?

57:57.796 --> 58:00.594
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

58:04.869 --> 58:07.360
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights?

58:07.806 --> 58:08.898
Hey.

58:13.745 --> 58:15.610
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

58:15.714 --> 58:17.204
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:18.083 --> 58:19.380
Thank you.

58:25.557 --> 58:27.923
Are those your friends over there?

58:31.496 --> 58:35.660
No. No, I've never seen them before
in my life.

58:37.135 --> 58:39.831
Could you just excuse me for one second?

58:42.140 --> 58:45.200
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.

58:45.310 --> 58:46.368
Yeah, we know.

58:46.478 --> 58:47.502
Yeah, well, can you not?

58:47.612 --> 58:49.375
I think it's gonna freak her out a bit,
don't you think?

58:49.481 --> 58:53.110
Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.

58:53.218 --> 58:54.879
So how do you know her?

58:54.986 --> 58:58.478
Did you, like, take some self-help seminar
or something?

58:59.556 --> 59:00.614
What?

59:01.125 --> 59:04.686
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.

59:04.962 --> 59:07.954
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.

59:08.065 --> 59:11.159
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.

59:11.268 --> 59:12.860
It's getting ridiculous.

59:12.970 --> 59:16.531
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.

59:16.640 --> 59:18.107
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.

59:18.208 --> 59:20.199
They let him, and he does.

59:20.978 --> 59:23.845
He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.

59:24.515 --> 59:27.006
The dealer turns over a 17.

59:27.117 --> 59:28.846
It's soft. He needs to take another card.

59:28.952 --> 59:31.318
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?

59:31.422 --> 59:34.220
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. My God.

59:35.559 --> 59:37.857
Not a great Christmas that year.

59:40.397 --> 59:43.855
So, what does he think about what you do?
Does he know?

59:44.435 --> 59:46.596
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.

59:49.173 --> 59:50.970
My dad's gone, too.

1:00:03.921 --> 1:00:08.221
So, you know, when you came into the store
to ask me to join the team,

1:00:09.059 --> 1:00:10.719
was that because...

1:00:11.127 --> 1:00:12.321
What?

1:00:12.662 --> 1:00:15.995
Well, you know,
was it because Micky asked you to?

1:00:19.135 --> 1:00:22.263
Look, we've had three classes together.

1:00:23.272 --> 1:00:26.241
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

1:00:26.342 --> 1:00:28.173
that nobody understood.

1:00:29.312 --> 1:00:33.510
You're the smartest person in every single
one of those classes, Ben.

1:00:33.616 --> 1:00:37.780
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

1:00:38.988 --> 1:00:40.922
No, no, not so much...

1:00:41.023 --> 1:00:43.890
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.

1:00:43.993 --> 1:00:46.427
- It's not a problem.
- I don't know why I just did that.

1:00:46.529 --> 1:00:47.757
- Don't apologize.
- Are you sure?

1:00:47.864 --> 1:00:50.424
Yes. Shit, this is my stop.

1:00:50.533 --> 1:00:52.933
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.

1:00:53.035 --> 1:00:55.731
But, really, don't worry about it.

1:00:56.439 --> 1:00:59.602
I don't know,
it's just 'cause we've been drinking, and...

1:00:59.709 --> 1:01:02.200
It's just we're on a team, we work together.

1:01:02.311 --> 1:01:04.745
- I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

1:01:04.847 --> 1:01:07.372
Okay. Sure. Bye.

1:01:27.502 --> 1:01:31.233
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

1:01:32.574 --> 1:01:35.543
<i>I had saved over $100,000.</i>

1:01:36.711 --> 1:01:38.770
<i>Only $200,000 to go.</i>

1:01:39.981 --> 1:01:43.917
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

1:01:54.329 --> 1:01:56.024
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

<i>But in Vegas, I could be anyone I wanted.</i>

1:02:24.793 --> 1:02:27.091
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

1:02:27.195 --> 1:02:30.460
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down

<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir

Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,

1:02:37.438 --> 1:02:41.101
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

1:02:41.609 --> 1:02:42.940
I may not be alone.

Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

1:02:56.357 --> 1:02:58.518
No, please, keep going.

1:03:02.363 --> 1:03:06.857

<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

1:03:09.503 --> 1:03:11.801
Yeah, room service.

1:03:11.905 --> 1:03:14.339
<i>Excuse me?
Honey, we don't do room service.</i>

1:03:14.441 --> 1:03:16.102
What do you mean,
you don't do room service?

1:03:16.210 --> 1:03:18.576
<i>I mean, we don't do room service.</i>

1:03:30.624 --> 1:03:33.286

1:04:01.788 --> 1:04:03.847
- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.

1:04:03.956 --> 1:04:05.651
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

1:04:05.758 --> 1:04:09.785
There you go. All right,
my night just got better. Thank you, Joe.

1:04:10.863 --> 1:04:13.730
<i>And it felt like it was never going to end.</i>

1:04:24.110 --> 1:04:27.204
Clark? I think I got something over here.

1:04:27.914 --> 1:04:29.609
Take a look at this.

1:04:32.118 --> 1:04:34.586
That guy? He's a kid.

1:04:34.687 --> 1:04:38.418
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

1:04:38.524 --> 1:04:40.890
Plus, he ordered a tonic and lime.

1:04:40.993 --> 1:04:43.689
Tonic and lime. What does that mean?

1:04:43.796 --> 1:04:46.026
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

1:04:46.132 --> 1:04:49.431
Okay. So is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

1:04:49.635 --> 1:04:51.569
He's not running a progressive system.

1:04:51.671 --> 1:04:54.867
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.

1:04:54.973 --> 1:04:57.601
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

1:04:57.709 --> 1:04:58.869
You...

1:05:02.214 --> 1:05:04.011
Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,

1:05:04.116 --> 1:05:05.845
why are you still consulting for us?

1:05:05.951 --> 1:05:07.418
I've been asking myself the same thing.

1:05:07.519 --> 1:05:10.955
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

1:05:11.389 --> 1:05:14.381
Bring up a frame of that for me
on the printer.

1:05:17.896 --> 1:05:20.387
So, Terry, I heard
you guys are losing a lot of work

1:05:20.499 --> 1:05:23.525
to that biometric facial recognition software.

1:05:25.103 --> 1:05:28.698
Just gives us a little bit more time
to focus on you guys.

1:05:31.243 --> 1:05:33.973
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

1:05:34.646 --> 1:05:35.977
Here he is.

1:05:38.316 --> 1:05:41.376
I still think there're bigger fish
to fry out there.

1:05:41.486 --> 1:05:42.817
So do I.

1:05:50.695 --> 1:05:52.287
Hey, Fisher.

1:05:52.397 --> 1:05:54.456
He's mad at me and jealous of you.

1:05:54.566 --> 1:05:57.057
But don't worry.
Greatness evokes that reaction sometimes.

1:05:57.169 --> 1:06:00.104
- Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

1:06:08.979 --> 1:06:10.947
- Hey.
- What's going on?

1:06:12.183 --> 1:06:15.812
He just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:17.547
- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?

1:06:17.655 --> 1:06:19.589
I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.

1:06:19.690 --> 1:06:21.715
At least I thought I was.

1:06:22.860 --> 1:06:24.452
Are you on drugs, Ben?

1:06:24.562 --> 1:06:26.496
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

1:06:26.597 --> 1:06:28.531
No, no. Cam, I'm not on drugs, okay?

1:06:28.632 --> 1:06:31.396
I'll go to the meeting if you need me to.

1:06:32.002 --> 1:06:34.732
Why didn't you tell me you quit J. Press?

1:06:36.207 --> 1:06:37.640
I don't know.

1:06:38.108 --> 1:06:40.338
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

1:06:42.513 --> 1:06:44.174
What about Harvard?

1:06:45.649 --> 1:06:48.311
It'll find a way of working itself out.

1:06:49.019 --> 1:06:51.613
Look, I gotta go. I'll see you.

1:07:03.901 --> 1:07:07.997
<i>I think the worst part of it
was not being able to tell anyone.</i>

1:07:12.176 --> 1:07:16.305
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

1:07:17.947 --> 1:07:19.073
Here you go, sir.

1:07:19.182 --> 1:07:20.740
<i>And I liked it.</i>

1:07:21.451 --> 1:07:22.918
That's for you.

1:07:25.188 --> 1:07:29.522
We just made $210,000.

1:07:29.626 --> 1:07:30.684
Yes.

1:07:30.793 --> 1:07:33.284
Now, Ben, this is how we play!

1:07:35.932 --> 1:07:38.366
<i>And play we did.</i>

1:07:42.605 --> 1:07:44.698
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

1:07:44.807 --> 1:07:47.332
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

1:07:52.982 --> 1:07:55.815
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

1:07:55.919 --> 1:07:58.513
<i>gave Ben Campbell a major upgrade.</i>

1:08:01.491 --> 1:08:04.358
<i>Dorm rooms turned into high-roller suites.</i>

1:08:06.029 --> 1:08:08.554
<i>Bicycles became stretch limos.</i>

1:08:12.201 --> 1:08:13.634
No, no!

1:08:16.940 --> 1:08:21.400
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

1:08:22.245 --> 1:08:26.146
<i>well, something more interesting.</i>

1:09:20.002 --> 1:09:23.768
- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- I'm from Boston.

1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:28.942
- On a convention?
- No, business, actually.

1:09:31.146 --> 1:09:33.512
What line of work you in, mister?

1:09:34.249 --> 1:09:36.011
I count things.

1:09:38.185 --> 1:09:39.777
My name's Sierra.

1:09:40.354 --> 1:09:45.587
Hi, Sierra. I'm Salvador Sanchez.

1:09:47.595 --> 1:09:50.359
Would you like a private dance, Salvador?

1:09:51.966 --> 1:09:55.868
Well, that all depends
on how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.

1:09:58.372 --> 1:10:01.000
$20 a song, 30-song minimum.

1:10:02.877 --> 1:10:04.469
Sounds expensive.

1:10:23.531 --> 1:10:27.991
- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.

1:10:28.102 --> 1:10:30.593
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.

1:10:31.705 --> 1:10:33.673
You are so lucky you're cute.

1:10:33.774 --> 1:10:36.470
'Cause if you weren't cute, I'd leave.
You know that?

1:10:36.577 --> 1:10:40.138
Jeffrey. My brother from another mother.

1:10:40.714 --> 1:10:41.806
How you doing? You good?

1:10:41.916 --> 1:10:45.113
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K.
What, are you back in town for business?

1:10:45.219 --> 1:10:50.349
- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.

1:10:51.257 --> 1:10:53.191
Oh, damn, I forgot my ring.

1:10:53.293 --> 1:10:55.193
Oh, please.

1:11:01.968 --> 1:11:05.233
I don't wanna bet that. That's for keep.

1:11:05.572 --> 1:11:07.267
$100,000 going out.

1:11:09.642 --> 1:11:11.303
Thank you, Jeffrey.

1:11:18.518 --> 1:11:20.577
Cole. Your boy's back.

1:11:24.591 --> 1:11:26.149
- That's him, right?
- There he is.

1:11:26.259 --> 1:11:29.285
And he brought
a whole lot more money with him.

1:11:36.436 --> 1:11:38.996
That is a hell of a suit, by the way.

1:11:54.587 --> 1:11:58.818
- That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.

1:12:03.829 --> 1:12:07.196
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

1:12:07.299 --> 1:12:11.998
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she signals him to come to the table.

1:12:13.405 --> 1:12:17.000
We don't use "tape" anymore, old school.
It's digital now.

1:12:19.411 --> 1:12:21.572
Never mind. Terry, rewind it.

1:12:24.449 --> 1:12:25.973
Okay, okay.

1:12:26.718 --> 1:12:28.379
She's playing the table minimum.

1:12:28.487 --> 1:12:30.648
Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.

1:12:30.756 --> 1:12:34.624
She's gonna raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.

1:12:35.794 --> 1:12:38.729
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

1:12:38.830 --> 1:12:42.163
He comes to the table.
I'm telling you, they're working together.

1:12:42.267 --> 1:12:43.325
Nice.

1:12:45.003 --> 1:12:47.563
Show me a computer that can do that.

1:12:52.411 --> 1:12:54.038
You look familiar.

1:12:55.347 --> 1:12:57.110
I know you, don't I?

1:12:58.717 --> 1:13:00.548
- I don't think so.
- No?

1:13:01.086 --> 1:13:05.352
<i>Oh, sure, you look exactly like that guy
in Rain Man.</i>

1:13:07.692 --> 1:13:10.525
Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.

1:13:10.628 --> 1:13:12.323
Oh, yeah? No.

1:13:13.431 --> 1:13:17.094
The other one, the... What's his... The retard.

1:13:18.102 --> 1:13:23.335
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

1:13:24.275 --> 1:13:26.209
You look just like that.

1:13:30.081 --> 1:13:36.953
What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,

1:13:37.855 --> 1:13:39.550
could win so much.

1:13:41.926 --> 1:13:45.418
Hey, Jeffrey,
his brother from another mother,

1:13:45.529 --> 1:13:47.292
how did that retard win so much?

1:13:47.398 --> 1:13:50.333
- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.

1:13:50.434 --> 1:13:52.629
Oh, I didn't mean it.

1:14:26.836 --> 1:14:30.033
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

1:14:40.417 --> 1:14:42.647
- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!

1:14:42.752 --> 1:14:44.617
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!

1:14:44.721 --> 1:14:48.179
Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!

1:14:48.291 --> 1:14:49.656
I understand, Ben. We don't need anymore...

1:14:49.759 --> 1:14:51.590
This is not the time. Okay?

1:14:51.695 --> 1:14:54.493
I want to thank you
for confirming my choice in Ben.

1:14:54.597 --> 1:14:55.962
Now go home.

1:15:02.339 --> 1:15:04.330
- What?
- You're off the team.

1:15:04.441 --> 1:15:05.499
No.

1:15:06.509 --> 1:15:09.876
- I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.

1:15:11.114 --> 1:15:12.411
I'm not leaving.

1:15:12.515 --> 1:15:15.040
Yes, you are.

1:15:15.552 --> 1:15:18.020
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

1:15:21.891 --> 1:15:25.759
You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.

1:15:25.862 --> 1:15:28.989
So I want you to pick up the ticket
and go home,

1:15:29.098 --> 1:15:33.125
because if you don't,
you know exactly what I'm capable of doing,

1:15:33.736 --> 1:15:35.033
don't you?

1:15:52.287 --> 1:15:53.276
All right, listen up.

1:15:53.389 --> 1:15:56.916
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.

1:15:57.025 --> 1:15:59.892
That means we got less than 24 hours
to cash in,

1:15:59.995 --> 1:16:02.259
or we're gonna be sitting
with 200 grand of worthless plastic.

1:16:02.364 --> 1:16:04.594
- So we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

1:16:04.700 --> 1:16:08.602
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

1:16:08.704 --> 1:16:10.899
So let's do it right now
before they can do that.

1:16:11.006 --> 1:16:12.974
Are you deliberately slow?

1:16:13.809 --> 1:16:15.367
What about them?

1:16:16.745 --> 1:16:18.303
What about them?

1:16:18.414 --> 1:16:22.714
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1:16:30.159 --> 1:16:31.592
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1:16:31.693 --> 1:16:33.786
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1:16:34.396 --> 1:16:36.830
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.

1:16:41.502 --> 1:16:43.561
I love a parade, don't you?

1:16:44.739 --> 1:16:48.505
You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,

1:16:49.110 --> 1:16:50.338
"Genius."

1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:21.866
Hey, Kianna.
Let me hold your bag for a second.

1:17:22.577 --> 1:17:23.839
Thanks, baby, here.

1:17:23.945 --> 1:17:25.435
Oh, no problem. Anytime.

1:17:25.546 --> 1:17:28.447
- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.

1:17:28.549 --> 1:17:29.538
Watch.

1:17:29.650 --> 1:17:33.381
No, it's great, you just need
to get your knee a little higher.

1:17:55.542 --> 1:17:57.066
- Hi.
- Hey.

1:17:58.445 --> 1:18:00.879
So the Hard Rock comped me a suite.

1:18:02.115 --> 1:18:04.083
That's cool, that's great.

1:18:07.153 --> 1:18:08.848
You wanna see it?

1:19:11.216 --> 1:19:13.878
All right, take care, Bobby. All right?

1:19:34.373 --> 1:19:35.897
God, it's cold.

1:19:36.342 --> 1:19:38.242
Hey, what time is it?

1:19:39.211 --> 1:19:42.374
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1:19:43.782 --> 1:19:45.841
Oh, look. Here he comes.

1:19:46.652 --> 1:19:48.643
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1:19:48.754 --> 1:19:49.982
Hey, Ben.

1:19:50.255 --> 1:19:52.052
You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.

1:19:52.157 --> 1:19:54.318
Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.

1:19:54.426 --> 1:19:55.791
Yeah, funny.

1:19:57.096 --> 1:20:00.725
- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.

1:20:00.833 --> 1:20:03.768
And you're sure
you didn't inlay the software on more space

1:20:03.869 --> 1:20:05.063
than the parameters suggest?

1:20:05.170 --> 1:20:07.195
No. It's just one-fifth of the free face.

1:20:07.306 --> 1:20:09.297
Let's fire this mother up.

1:20:09.408 --> 1:20:10.670
Beautiful.

1:20:19.517 --> 1:20:20.745
Okay.

1:20:21.285 --> 1:20:22.377
Okay.

1:20:25.890 --> 1:20:27.482
What's happening?

1:20:30.828 --> 1:20:33.353
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1:20:33.464 --> 1:20:34.726
No. What?

1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:39.099
- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.

1:20:40.772 --> 1:20:42.672
Yeah, we needed 16K!

1:20:44.108 --> 1:20:47.908
- I can't believe this.
- I thought it was an 8K.

1:20:48.012 --> 1:20:49.604
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

1:20:49.714 --> 1:20:53.946
No, you didn't. You knew the entire time
the discrete was 16K.

1:20:54.452 --> 1:20:55.714
Damn it, Ben.

1:20:55.820 --> 1:20:59.085
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1:20:59.190 --> 1:21:02.591
And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.

1:21:02.694 --> 1:21:06.130
Miles, calm down, all right?
It was an honest mistake.

1:21:08.766 --> 1:21:10.063
What?

1:21:12.403 --> 1:21:17.170
You know what? I think we're gonna have
to go at this without you, man.

1:21:18.276 --> 1:21:19.971
You're gonna what?

1:21:22.813 --> 1:21:26.408
No, no.
This is just as much mine as it is yours.

1:21:26.516 --> 1:21:29.110
We've been working on this for over a year.

1:21:29.219 --> 1:21:32.780
I know that.
But your heart just isn't in this anymore.

1:21:38.562 --> 1:21:40.120
Are you serious?

1:21:46.837 --> 1:21:47.861
Fine.

1:21:49.706 --> 1:21:50.798
Fine.

1:21:52.209 --> 1:21:56.441
You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.

1:21:56.546 --> 1:21:57.774
You know why?

1:21:57.881 --> 1:22:02.250
'Cause no one in the real world gives a shit
about the 2.09 Competition.

1:22:03.353 --> 1:22:05.218
You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head

1:22:05.322 --> 1:22:07.313
to make yourselves feel important.

1:22:07.424 --> 1:22:09.324
You guys are pathetic.

1:22:09.426 --> 1:22:10.586
Thanks.

1:22:17.567 --> 1:22:18.966
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.

1:22:19.069 --> 1:22:22.835
- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1:22:26.476 --> 1:22:29.468
Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.

1:22:29.579 --> 1:22:31.046
Nice to see you.

1:22:31.148 --> 1:22:33.809
Anything I can do for you, let me know.

1:22:51.367 --> 1:22:52.732
Double down.

1:23:28.470 --> 1:23:31.496
I guess you play big or you don't play at all.

1:23:32.708 --> 1:23:33.936
Right?

1:23:36.445 --> 1:23:40.472
Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!

1:23:40.583 --> 1:23:43.380
Honey, we're actually playing a game here.

1:23:43.852 --> 1:23:44.944
Yeah.

1:23:45.353 --> 1:23:47.116
Yeah, so you know what?

1:23:47.222 --> 1:23:51.283
Why don't you run upstairs
and wait for me there? Okay?

1:23:53.895 --> 1:23:55.726
All right. Let's go.

1:24:00.902 --> 1:24:02.893
Yeah, all right.

1:24:03.504 --> 1:24:06.098
I've got the worst headache right now.

1:24:20.121 --> 1:24:21.952
- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.

1:24:22.056 --> 1:24:24.422
- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.

1:24:24.525 --> 1:24:26.652
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1:24:27.962 --> 1:24:29.395
Twenty-one.

1:24:35.837 --> 1:24:37.771
Pete, you're killing us.

1:24:51.019 --> 1:24:53.010
I guess it's not my night.

1:25:17.945 --> 1:25:20.072
Are you out of your mind?

1:25:21.448 --> 1:25:23.473
I don't know what happened.

1:25:23.750 --> 1:25:26.378
I messed up. I'm sorry.

1:25:27.554 --> 1:25:28.782
Oh, you're sorry.

1:25:28.889 --> 1:25:32.484
Well, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.

1:25:32.592 --> 1:25:37.154
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!

1:25:37.264 --> 1:25:41.325
So we can all go back to being friends
and laughing over cocktails!

1:25:42.536 --> 1:25:43.901
Come on, Micky. It can happen to anyone.

1:25:44.004 --> 1:25:45.437
They get on a rush and they lose control.

1:25:45.539 --> 1:25:47.166
You shut your mouth. This is business.

1:25:47.274 --> 1:25:50.641
Hey, I let you down, all right? I get it.

1:25:50.744 --> 1:25:54.578
Excuse me? You let me down? I don't care!

1:25:55.215 --> 1:25:58.343
Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!

1:25:58.452 --> 1:26:01.478
You are not my friend. This is a business.

1:26:01.755 --> 1:26:03.882
You are only as good to me
as the money you make,

1:26:03.991 --> 1:26:05.685
and, right now, it's not worth a hell of a lot!

1:26:05.791 --> 1:26:07.520
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1:26:07.626 --> 1:26:10.390
I can't do that! That money was for Harvard!

1:26:10.496 --> 1:26:12.396
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1:26:12.498 --> 1:26:14.329
It doesn't matter, Ben.

1:26:14.433 --> 1:26:17.561
You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.

1:26:17.670 --> 1:26:21.606
You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!

1:26:24.143 --> 1:26:27.044
Well, why aren't you out there, then, Micky?

1:26:27.613 --> 1:26:32.312
I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.

1:26:37.023 --> 1:26:38.957
This isn't about me,

1:26:39.792 --> 1:26:43.489
you arrogant little infant.

1:26:56.409 --> 1:26:59.037
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1:26:59.145 --> 1:27:03.206
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.

1:27:03.315 --> 1:27:05.306
And you damn well know it.

1:27:15.393 --> 1:27:16.883
I need a drink.

1:27:19.731 --> 1:27:21.164
Anybody else?

1:27:24.202 --> 1:27:25.931
Yeah, well, we don't need him.

1:27:26.037 --> 1:27:27.698
- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.

1:27:27.806 --> 1:27:30.468
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1:27:30.575 --> 1:27:33.840
You know, his cut was 50%,
and he doesn't even play!

1:27:34.412 --> 1:27:35.572
Why do we need him?

1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:36.772
Hey, you know what I think?

1:27:36.881 --> 1:27:40.214
I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.

1:27:40.318 --> 1:27:41.717
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.

1:27:41.820 --> 1:27:44.050
I think we should go back to Boston
and figure this out.

1:27:44.155 --> 1:27:45.952
Yeah, well,
why don't we let the team decide?

1:27:46.057 --> 1:27:49.185
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1:27:49.294 --> 1:27:51.285
And then he drove us apart.

1:27:51.396 --> 1:27:54.422
I mean, you saw
how he played Fisher against me.

1:27:55.366 --> 1:27:58.995
Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?

1:28:00.505 --> 1:28:02.166
- Kind of.
- Really?

1:28:02.941 --> 1:28:06.206
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1:28:06.311 --> 1:28:09.474
All I'm saying is that we try it. You know?

1:28:09.581 --> 1:28:13.381
If we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.

1:28:14.452 --> 1:28:15.749
All of it.

1:28:22.894 --> 1:28:24.191
Okay.

1:28:28.499 --> 1:28:29.557
Yeah.

1:28:30.033 --> 1:28:32.092
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:28:33.837 --> 1:28:35.031
Choi?

1:28:36.406 --> 1:28:37.668
I'm in.

1:28:39.543 --> 1:28:41.238
Now I need a drink.

1:28:47.217 --> 1:28:48.980
- What are you doing?
- What?

1:28:49.086 --> 1:28:51.054
What are you doing?

1:28:51.155 --> 1:28:53.214
Well, we're printing money.

1:28:53.657 --> 1:28:56.353
What, you think just 'cause Micky left
that we're gonna stop?

1:28:56.460 --> 1:28:59.258
No, I could do this. I can lead this team.

1:28:59.630 --> 1:29:02.895
You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.

1:29:03.367 --> 1:29:05.597
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

1:29:06.103 --> 1:29:08.731
You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be

1:29:08.839 --> 1:29:11.831
when you first came into the store
to buy a tie?

1:29:16.113 --> 1:29:18.775
What happened to "$300,000 and I'm out"?

1:29:19.716 --> 1:29:22.412
What happened to "a means to an end"?

1:29:23.353 --> 1:29:26.186
- How much do you have?
- What?

1:29:26.290 --> 1:29:28.485
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1:29:28.592 --> 1:29:30.822
Come on, Ben. How much do you have
saved back in Boston?

1:29:30.928 --> 1:29:33.453
I've got 315 grand, all right?

1:29:33.830 --> 1:29:36.128
Then why are you still here?

1:29:37.466 --> 1:29:41.425
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1:29:41.871 --> 1:29:43.736
So does everybody else.

1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:46.836
So come on, Jill. Are you in?

1:29:52.715 --> 1:29:55.479
You are the big player, Ben.

1:29:55.585 --> 1:29:56.950
Yes, I am.

1:29:59.388 --> 1:30:01.288
Yeah, can I get a drink?

1:30:29.218 --> 1:30:31.152
Rose, I wanna thank you.

1:30:32.188 --> 1:30:34.554
You have been most accommodating.

1:30:35.124 --> 1:30:37.092
All right, that's for you.

1:30:37.393 --> 1:30:39.691
Okay, take care. Hey, good luck.

1:30:47.270 --> 1:30:49.260
Hey, how we doing here, people?

1:31:00.582 --> 1:31:03.983
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.

1:31:07.589 --> 1:31:09.716
Just got an interesting call.

1:31:11.826 --> 1:31:15.887
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1:31:18.333 --> 1:31:20.233
I don't know about that.

1:31:25.874 --> 1:31:27.307
This is Cole.

1:31:38.086 --> 1:31:40.884
Queen of diamonds. Your lady luck tonight.

1:31:41.389 --> 1:31:43.016
You're doing good.

1:31:43.325 --> 1:31:45.088
You're a real winner.

1:31:49.864 --> 1:31:52.560
Sometimes. Just like everybody else.

1:31:53.635 --> 1:31:55.830
Now, why don't I believe that?

1:31:57.939 --> 1:31:59.997
Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?

1:32:00.107 --> 1:32:02.769
Yeah, I bet it's been that way your entire life.

1:32:02.876 --> 1:32:06.642
Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?

1:32:08.382 --> 1:32:09.747
I'd split them.

1:32:09.850 --> 1:32:14.287
Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.

1:32:21.095 --> 1:32:23.188
Kianna. I think
we have a serious problem over there.

1:32:23.297 --> 1:32:24.764
- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1:32:24.865 --> 1:32:27.925
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.

1:32:28.035 --> 1:32:29.764
I think we need
to call security or something.

1:32:29.870 --> 1:32:33.465
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.

1:32:38.078 --> 1:32:40.046
Let's take a walk, huh?

1:32:40.781 --> 1:32:44.547
Come on, kid.
See if we can't get you that chicken dinner.

1:32:49.723 --> 1:32:52.317
It's called Biometrics.

1:32:52.426 --> 1:32:56.658
Biometrics.
It's sort of like a fingerprint of your face.

1:32:59.299 --> 1:33:04.532
See, when the player sits down
at the table, the software, it reads this...

1:33:04.638 --> 1:33:06.105
Biometric profile.

1:33:06.206 --> 1:33:07.969
...biometric profile of your face,

1:33:08.075 --> 1:33:11.100
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1:33:14.647 --> 1:33:19.448
Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.

1:33:22.622 --> 1:33:23.919
All right.

1:33:29.495 --> 1:33:32.362
You understand all this. You go to MIT.

1:33:32.732 --> 1:33:34.131
Smart boy.

1:33:35.601 --> 1:33:37.535
My name is Cole Williams.

1:33:38.137 --> 1:33:41.402
And if I ever see you in this town again,

1:33:42.175 --> 1:33:45.576
I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,

1:33:46.813 --> 1:33:48.804
and then I will kill you.

1:33:53.486 --> 1:33:57.047
Please. Please just take the money.

1:33:58.291 --> 1:33:59.815
You can take it.

1:34:02.528 --> 1:34:03.859
Tell me,

1:34:04.430 --> 1:34:09.163
how's good old Professor Rosa doing, huh?

1:34:10.837 --> 1:34:15.433
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky, we go way back.

1:34:16.542 --> 1:34:19.533
I spent years, chased him all over this town.

1:34:19.978 --> 1:34:24.938
Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.

1:34:25.050 --> 1:34:27.018
He was very persistent.

1:34:27.919 --> 1:34:31.218
And then, one September night,

1:34:31.723 --> 1:34:34.624
when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,

1:34:35.494 --> 1:34:38.930
my casino was taken for seven figures.

1:34:39.030 --> 1:34:40.361
Can you imagine that?

1:34:40.465 --> 1:34:43.696
The most ever taken by a single counter
in one night.

1:34:43.802 --> 1:34:48.398
'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.

1:34:51.109 --> 1:34:52.872
Funny thing, though.

1:34:53.278 --> 1:34:55.803
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.

1:34:56.982 --> 1:34:58.108
Never.

1:36:24.835 --> 1:36:26.962
<i>Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study</i>

1:36:27.071 --> 1:36:31.098
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1:36:31.208 --> 1:36:33.506
And was concerned with developing

1:36:33.611 --> 1:36:38.480
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1:36:39.883 --> 1:36:41.315
Any questions?

1:36:41.718 --> 1:36:43.845
No? All right, moving on.

1:36:44.887 --> 1:36:48.880
Isn't it true Cauchy stole from his students?

1:36:53.796 --> 1:36:57.664
Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?

1:36:58.701 --> 1:37:03.229
They say he used his students
for their brilliance,

1:37:04.374 --> 1:37:08.606
then discredited them
and stole their equations,

1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:12.545
stole their hard work.

1:37:15.251 --> 1:37:17.947
Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.

1:37:18.054 --> 1:37:22.753
I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?

1:37:22.859 --> 1:37:25.794
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1:37:25.895 --> 1:37:29.228
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1:37:29.332 --> 1:37:31.800
and publishing it under a pseudonym.

1:37:33.636 --> 1:37:35.297
Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.

1:37:35.405 --> 1:37:39.398
They never did prove it, and without
the proof, it's a little like it never happened.

1:37:39.509 --> 1:37:41.534
And, you know, it's a real shame,

1:37:41.644 --> 1:37:45.842
because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,

1:37:45.948 --> 1:37:47.677
this was the dispute,

1:37:48.718 --> 1:37:54.713
if he'd been able to get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,

1:37:55.257 --> 1:37:58.488
I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,

1:37:58.593 --> 1:38:01.619
and they could have
done great things together.

1:38:02.030 --> 1:38:06.091
But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.

1:38:07.803 --> 1:38:09.464
You should get that eye looked at.

1:38:46.675 --> 1:38:48.074
You okay?

1:38:51.046 --> 1:38:52.673
Everything's gone.

1:38:54.483 --> 1:38:57.077
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1:38:57.185 --> 1:39:01.417
He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.

1:39:03.290 --> 1:39:05.383
- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.

1:39:05.493 --> 1:39:07.893
I gotta find a way to get it back.

1:39:09.196 --> 1:39:10.686
Are you insane?

1:39:11.298 --> 1:39:14.859
You just got the shit kicked out of you
and you won't let this go!

1:39:14.969 --> 1:39:18.905
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!

1:39:19.673 --> 1:39:21.163
Look, please...

1:39:22.977 --> 1:39:25.241
I don't want to lose you, too.

1:39:28.249 --> 1:39:31.844
Ben, you were dragged away in Vegas.

1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:36.854
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1:39:37.558 --> 1:39:38.786
I know.

1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:40.920
I know.

1:39:48.269 --> 1:39:51.067
You know, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

1:39:52.873 --> 1:39:54.238
I'm sorry.

1:39:57.111 --> 1:40:01.605
In Vegas, I don't know what happened.
That wasn't me.

1:40:02.817 --> 1:40:04.444
Look, you know me.

1:40:05.152 --> 1:40:07.017
You know what I'm like.

1:40:08.823 --> 1:40:10.313
You know me.

1:40:16.763 --> 1:40:18.628
I need you to trust me.

1:40:19.966 --> 1:40:23.333
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1:40:23.436 --> 1:40:29.705
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Conolly and Kazazi!</i>

1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:10.049
That's it. That's the story.

1:41:12.552 --> 1:41:14.782
Jill Taylor. Really?

1:41:15.588 --> 1:41:19.080
- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.

1:41:19.192 --> 1:41:23.390
Yeah, it doesn't feel like "wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.

1:41:23.495 --> 1:41:28.228
Yeah, you did.
But you had a life experience.

1:41:32.671 --> 1:41:34.662
I can't believe how I treated you, Miles.

1:41:34.773 --> 1:41:38.675
You know, you're my best friend,
and I really let you down.

1:41:39.544 --> 1:41:42.638
I really let you down. I'm sorry.

1:41:44.449 --> 1:41:48.977
And I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's great.

1:41:50.355 --> 1:41:52.823
- Jill Taylor. Really?
- Yeah.

1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:57.453
So let me get this straight.

1:41:58.130 --> 1:42:01.293
Money, girls,

1:42:02.467 --> 1:42:06.870
high-roller suites, clubs, Vegas.

1:42:08.073 --> 1:42:13.101
Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.

1:42:16.648 --> 1:42:18.013
So we cool?

1:42:19.651 --> 1:42:21.243
Yeah, we're cool.

1:42:21.753 --> 1:42:24.449
But you better believe that
you're gonna make this up to me, big time.

1:42:24.556 --> 1:42:25.818
All right.

1:42:27.125 --> 1:42:29.252
So, what are you gonna do now?

1:43:20.044 --> 1:43:21.875
What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.

1:43:21.979 --> 1:43:24.345
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1:43:24.448 --> 1:43:26.848
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1:43:33.057 --> 1:43:34.024
What?

1:43:34.125 --> 1:43:38.255
Look, I've had some time
to think about what you said.

1:43:40.131 --> 1:43:41.621
I want back in.

1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:46.467
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1:43:48.338 --> 1:43:51.535
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very, very good.

1:43:51.641 --> 1:43:55.805
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1:43:55.912 --> 1:43:59.609
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1:43:59.716 --> 1:44:04.176
Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.

1:44:05.155 --> 1:44:07.123
With this facial recognition software,

1:44:07.223 --> 1:44:10.420
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:14.623
Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.

1:44:14.731 --> 1:44:19.862
Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.

1:44:21.371 --> 1:44:26.673
Well, you know, that's why I was thinking
maybe you should be the other big player.

1:44:28.078 --> 1:44:31.411
You know, two big players playing big?

1:44:32.582 --> 1:44:35.915
Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.

1:44:40.356 --> 1:44:41.948
But Fisher's out.

1:44:42.826 --> 1:44:47.195
No one else on the team
can be the big player, can they?

1:44:50.433 --> 1:44:53.834
And if we do well, if we do really well,

1:44:54.604 --> 1:44:57.766
then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,

1:44:58.774 --> 1:45:01.299
and I might even get that sabbatical.

1:45:02.311 --> 1:45:06.771
Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?

1:45:08.717 --> 1:45:11.413
Just went back to the head of the class.

1:45:12.688 --> 1:45:14.553
I gotta go be social.

1:45:19.928 --> 1:45:23.227
All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.

1:45:23.332 --> 1:45:26.199
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1:45:26.735 --> 1:45:29.795
But the return is gonna be the biggest.

1:45:31.106 --> 1:45:34.542
Now they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.

1:45:34.776 --> 1:45:36.744
And we can't mess around.

1:45:37.112 --> 1:45:38.579
I'm glad you're back with us, Micky.

1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:40.580
Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town

1:45:40.682 --> 1:45:44.174
and not prove to Ben
that I can do more than just teach.

1:45:45.020 --> 1:45:48.922
But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,

1:45:49.024 --> 1:45:52.084
and tonight we forget about the past.

1:45:52.327 --> 1:45:54.192
We just focus on the future.

1:45:54.296 --> 1:45:57.629
Right. This is our last time.

1:45:58.033 --> 1:46:01.059
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club.

1:46:01.170 --> 1:46:03.502
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1:46:06.974 --> 1:46:08.874
Let's go make a killing.

1:46:09.410 --> 1:46:10.775
All right.

1:46:32.900 --> 1:46:35.368
Let's see what we can do with this.

1:46:44.478 --> 1:46:48.539
Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?

1:46:50.218 --> 1:46:52.345
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1:46:52.453 --> 1:46:56.913
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1:47:08.569 --> 1:47:10.730
Winner, winner, chicken dinner! There it is.

1:47:10.838 --> 1:47:14.274
Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.

1:47:15.076 --> 1:47:18.374
And, Jim, I might even love you.

1:47:28.188 --> 1:47:30.383
Hey, you mind if I sit down?

1:47:44.404 --> 1:47:45.462
What's your name?

1:47:45.572 --> 1:47:48.700
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1:47:48.808 --> 1:47:51.038
There you go, give me it all.

1:48:01.087 --> 1:48:02.281
There you go.

1:48:05.058 --> 1:48:06.821
Thank you. Thank you.

1:48:11.564 --> 1:48:13.794
Such a shame, Shane!

1:48:14.768 --> 1:48:16.827
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?

1:48:16.936 --> 1:48:21.270
- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.

1:48:21.374 --> 1:48:23.467
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

1:48:36.789 --> 1:48:38.313
What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?

1:48:38.424 --> 1:48:41.086
This never happens, this never happens.

1:48:54.139 --> 1:48:55.936
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1:48:56.041 --> 1:48:57.599
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1:48:57.710 --> 1:48:58.844
- Split tens!
- Again!

1:48:58.844 --> 1:48:59.572
- Split tens!
- Again!

1:49:22.501 --> 1:49:25.470
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.

1:49:26.705 --> 1:49:28.570
Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.

1:49:28.674 --> 1:49:31.575
Come on, just give me the chips!

1:49:31.677 --> 1:49:35.807
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1:49:35.914 --> 1:49:38.473
- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1:49:38.583 --> 1:49:41.643
Nice to see you. Have a good night, darling.

1:49:47.191 --> 1:49:48.488
This way!

1:49:59.704 --> 1:50:00.796
Go.

1:50:15.153 --> 1:50:16.518
This way!

1:50:22.427 --> 1:50:24.418
Come on, Jill. Come on!

1:50:34.338 --> 1:50:36.932
Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.

1:50:37.041 --> 1:50:39.908
Give me the chips, I'll meet you at Fox's.

1:50:45.983 --> 1:50:47.575
Go, go, go, go!

1:50:58.528 --> 1:51:00.189
Come on, come on.

1:51:03.300 --> 1:51:04.858
Move, move, move!

1:51:09.039 --> 1:51:10.301
Come on.

1:51:11.441 --> 1:51:13.033
Go, go, this way.

1:51:25.021 --> 1:51:26.852
All right, let's go.

1:51:34.931 --> 1:51:37.422
Go, go, go, go! Airport!

1:51:55.986 --> 1:51:57.613
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa after that.</i>

1:52:02.691 --> 1:52:03.953
Oh, God.

1:52:05.060 --> 1:52:07.324
But I think I wanna see him now.

1:52:08.397 --> 1:52:10.865
And I want you to make that happen.

1:52:15.137 --> 1:52:17.571
I don't work for Micky anymore.

1:52:20.576 --> 1:52:22.009
Come on, kid.

1:52:23.846 --> 1:52:27.612
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1:52:28.651 --> 1:52:30.585
But I will give you one night.

1:52:30.686 --> 1:52:33.746
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1:52:34.657 --> 1:52:38.423
You'll make a killing, and you'll keep it all.

1:52:41.497 --> 1:52:42.691
Listen.

1:52:44.266 --> 1:52:45.733
My name's Cole.

1:52:47.303 --> 1:52:48.827
Cole Williams.

1:52:50.739 --> 1:52:53.139
You just bring me Micky Rosa, kid.

1:52:53.442 --> 1:52:55.467
I'll take care of the rest.

1:52:58.013 --> 1:53:00.948
Son of a bitch.

1:53:43.591 --> 1:53:45.354
Who the hell are you?

1:54:08.216 --> 1:54:11.379
Ben. Good job.

1:54:12.453 --> 1:54:17.516
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?

1:54:17.725 --> 1:54:19.818
It's gonna work out for you.

1:54:21.395 --> 1:54:22.953
So that's it?

1:54:24.398 --> 1:54:27.162
- That's it.
- All right.

1:54:28.135 --> 1:54:29.830
Oh, Dr. Campbell?

1:54:31.171 --> 1:54:34.140
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1:54:34.474 --> 1:54:36.374
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1:54:36.476 --> 1:54:40.378
And I been chasing Micky Rosa around here
for too damn long.

1:54:41.615 --> 1:54:43.879
I'm looking at some retirement.

1:54:45.786 --> 1:54:47.253
Leave the bag.

1:54:49.322 --> 1:54:51.620
No. No, no, no, no.

1:54:51.725 --> 1:54:56.219
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1:54:56.329 --> 1:55:01.323
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,

1:55:01.435 --> 1:55:03.164
'cause you're smart.

1:55:04.738 --> 1:55:09.266
So, you're gonna leave the bag.

1:55:14.314 --> 1:55:18.910
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.

1:55:27.761 --> 1:55:29.558
I knew you were smart.

1:55:48.414 --> 1:55:51.144
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1:55:51.250 --> 1:55:53.309
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1:55:53.819 --> 1:55:56.947
<i>And I have a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1:55:57.056 --> 1:55:59.524
<i>I thought I had my life mapped out.</i>

1:56:01.427 --> 1:56:02.519
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1:56:02.628 --> 1:56:06.086
<i>what my Nonlinear Equations professor
once told me,</i>

1:56:06.632 --> 1:56:09.863
<i>"Always account for variable change."</i>

1:56:11.670 --> 1:56:13.194
Hello, Micky.

1:56:14.907 --> 1:56:16.738
Look, I got money in Boston.
A hundred grand.

1:56:16.842 --> 1:56:18.867
I'll give it to you.
Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.

1:56:18.978 --> 1:56:22.038
I don't want your money, Micky.
I don't need it.

1:56:27.853 --> 1:56:30.651
But I know someone
who might be interested.

1:56:31.023 --> 1:56:35.119
He's good with numbers, too.
He works for the IRS.

1:56:43.935 --> 1:56:45.994
<i>I let down my good friends.</i>

1:56:46.671 --> 1:56:51.608
<i>But as it turns out,
they weren't too bad at simple math either.</i>

1:57:17.435 --> 1:57:19.995
<i>I scored the prettiest girl in school.</i>

1:57:23.474 --> 1:57:26.102
<i>I got beaten down
by an old-school Vegas thug</i>

1:57:26.211 --> 1:57:29.408
<i>who was having trouble
accepting his retirement.</i>

1:57:30.715 --> 1:57:34.481
<i>But I worked out a deal with him
that got him a nice pension.</i>

1:57:37.856 --> 1:57:40.654
<i>And I lied to my mother.</i>

1:57:41.125 --> 1:57:44.822
<i>But I confessed the lie,
and, well, she still loved me.</i>

1:58:01.345 --> 1:58:04.610
<i>So my senior year of college,
I joined this team.</i>

1:58:05.015 --> 1:58:07.176
<i>And I learned this new skill.</i>

1:58:07.417 --> 1:58:10.443
<i>I went to Vegas 17 times to use it.</i>

1:58:12.623 --> 1:58:16.150
<i>I made hundreds of thousands of dollars
counting cards.</i>

1:58:17.194 --> 1:58:19.754
And then I had it all stolen from me.

1:58:20.697 --> 1:58:21.857
Twice.

1:58:23.166 --> 1:58:27.262
How's that for life experience, professor?
Did I dazzle you?

1:58:28.438 --> 1:58:30.963
Did I jump off the page?

1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:40.920
