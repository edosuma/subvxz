WEBVTT

00:16.183 --> 00:17.017
<i>Sato!</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:24.650
All of us... we're sick of being
a part of your games!

00:25.359 --> 00:28.487
In other words, we're going to take
the nerve gas that was recovered

00:28.612 --> 00:30.948
and disperse it underground,
thus disabling Sato?

00:31.073 --> 00:36.036
We can't evacuate the civilians,
or Sato will realize what we're doing.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.621
We have roughly four hours left.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.332
Capture Sato before then,
no matter what it takes.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.625
Go, Ghost!

00:41.750 --> 00:44.878
-Stop them with all you've got!
-I know!

00:44.962 --> 00:47.589
He's no revolutionary, nor tactician.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.258
He's just playing a game.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.052
But that's why he's got a weakness
we can capitalize on.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.220
What do you plan to do?

00:54.096 --> 00:55.305
Bury him alive.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.767
Nice idea.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.230
However... just when you think
you've won...

01:03.981 --> 01:06.900
somebody pulls the rug out
from under you.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.902
What is it?

01:09.236 --> 01:10.904
-It's going to collapse?
-We overdid it!

01:10.988 --> 01:12.489
No, it's the floor!

01:12.573 --> 01:13.407
Mr. Tosaki!

01:20.706 --> 01:23.750
I am going to kill...

01:24.626 --> 01:26.336
each and every one of you.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.881
So, we didn't get him?

01:31.633 --> 01:34.845
Press start to play.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.317
<i>Open your eyes</i>
<i>This destiny</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:51.445
<i>If I can't escape it</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:53.196
<i>Then I'll swallow it all down</i>

01:53.322 --> 01:57.576
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And I'll fight</i>

01:57.701 --> 01:58.952
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

02:04.249 --> 02:07.210
<i>The menace that dominates</i>

02:07.336 --> 02:10.339
<i>The darkness in my troubled mind</i>

02:10.464 --> 02:13.508
<i>The truth of a human</i>

02:13.634 --> 02:16.511
<i>Who has begun to lose control</i>

02:16.637 --> 02:18.889
<i>That meaninglessness</i>

02:19.014 --> 02:22.351
<i>I've come to know it</i>

02:22.851 --> 02:25.187
<i>If even counterfeit peace</i>

02:25.270 --> 02:28.899
<i>Will break into pieces</i>

02:29.024 --> 02:33.445
<i>I will cast</i>

02:33.570 --> 02:40.327
<i>A defiant shadow</i>

02:41.161 --> 02:44.164
<i>It's the end of escape</i>
<i>Stand up</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:47.250
<i>Because it's the only way</i>

02:47.376 --> 02:53.465
<i>Follow it</i>
<i>The small hope I aim for</i>

02:53.548 --> 02:56.551
<i>The weakness that spilled</i>
<i>From the proffered hand</i>

02:56.635 --> 02:59.805
<i>I swallowed it all down</i>

02:59.930 --> 03:06.395
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And lost my mind</i>

03:10.565 --> 03:14.403
I'LL MAKE YOU A PROMISE TOO, MR. SATO

03:16.696 --> 03:17.989
What is this place?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.707
Nagai!

03:27.791 --> 03:28.834
Nagai!

03:29.710 --> 03:31.712
What happened?! Search team!

03:32.546 --> 03:33.588
<i>An explosion!</i>

03:33.714 --> 03:37.509
There's been a large-scale collapse
caused by an explosion at point F-2!

03:37.592 --> 03:40.470
There's an older underground
bunker beneath the sewers!

03:43.932 --> 03:46.059
Damn it, can't reach Okuyama
and the others.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.561
Nagai!

03:47.853 --> 03:49.104
Nakano, shut up!

03:51.398 --> 03:52.899
-Nagai.
-Where's Sato?!

03:53.024 --> 03:54.609
Not here! Neither are the others!

03:55.652 --> 03:57.237
That way's a dead end.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.447
What's going on?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.948
Damn it!

04:00.031 --> 04:01.450
He got us.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.703
So, we got buried ourselves?

04:04.786 --> 04:06.413
Now the problem is Sato.

04:06.913 --> 04:10.792
He's sure to come to finish us off,
if he's not trapped.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.588
-Is it Sato?
-Must be!

04:14.713 --> 04:17.924
-So, he must be fighting against Tosaki--
-Izumi!

04:18.049 --> 04:18.884
Let's go!

04:21.470 --> 04:23.263
Kuro-chan, please!

04:28.518 --> 04:31.480
I like to take care of my things.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.898
The one from before...?!

04:41.239 --> 04:42.115
Mr. Tosaki.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.037
That won't do.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.087
-Any casualties?
-No, sir.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.005
It's a trap.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.757
Will this affect the gas deployment?

04:58.882 --> 05:02.052
Conditions have changed slightly,
but we're still within projections.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.096
Right. Once the installation is complete,
withdraw immediately!

05:05.180 --> 05:06.014
<i>Roger!</i>

05:08.266 --> 05:10.060
We'll retreat as well in five minutes.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.693
I never thought I'd be your baggage.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.904
Don't worry about it.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.531
This is my job--

05:24.533 --> 05:26.785
I'll start with you two.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.040
Nagai, can you hear me?! Nagai!

05:34.125 --> 05:40.090
You're going to wish you'd died
before you got in my way.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.095
Go!

05:46.471 --> 05:47.305
Hurry!

06:01.987 --> 06:03.780
That's one down.

06:06.074 --> 06:06.950
What?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.416
You're human, aren't you?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.335
I'm a ghost.

06:17.961 --> 06:22.507
I should have died...
back at the Musashi Building.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.145
Turn right!

06:37.647 --> 06:40.483
Three targets confirmed!
It's the Ajin! Capture all of them!

06:47.324 --> 06:48.950
You kids go on ahead!

06:58.043 --> 06:59.794
Don't give up, Mr. Tosaki!

07:01.254 --> 07:02.213
The bank...

07:05.425 --> 07:07.052
The safe-deposit box...

07:07.636 --> 07:09.763
There's proof that you're an Ajin.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.849
Mr. Tosaki, what are you talking--?

07:12.933 --> 07:13.892
Shut up and listen.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.856
The key to the safe-deposit box is in
my fiancÃ©e's hospital room.

07:22.984 --> 07:23.818
So, go and get it.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.073
With this leg, I'll never get away.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.493
But I'm sure Nagai and the others--

07:33.411 --> 07:34.829
I'm ending our contract.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.084
Hurry up and get out of my sight!

07:49.636 --> 07:53.139
Are you saying I'm free?

07:53.390 --> 07:54.224
Yeah.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.935
Go live however you want.

07:57.268 --> 08:01.022
Then I'm free to protect you, too,
right, Mr. Tosaki?

08:01.606 --> 08:04.150
-Don't be so stupid--
-I'm not accepting orders anymore.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.152
You ended the contract.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.073
Mr. Tosaki...

08:11.992 --> 08:15.286
Thank you for giving me a new life.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.122
Stop! You can't win!

08:23.545 --> 08:25.255
So, you'll be number two.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.011
<i>Still no good, huh?</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:43.356
No!

08:48.737 --> 08:52.991
I'll bring you face-to-face
with the new you...

08:56.786 --> 08:57.704
I'm Nagai.

09:08.798 --> 09:14.596
This is the end of your games, Mr. Sato!

09:29.527 --> 09:31.780
You're late.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.908
Sorry about that.

09:35.867 --> 09:39.454
I must have taken a wrong turn.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.225
Colonel! This way!

10:05.063 --> 10:06.898
-And the installation?
-It's finished.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.567
Right, wait for orders.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.155
Damn it!

10:18.368 --> 10:22.372
This is payback for before!

10:26.417 --> 10:27.293
You!

10:29.337 --> 10:30.255
Damn it!

10:34.759 --> 10:35.635
Kuro-chan!

10:39.097 --> 10:44.519
You... I need to return the favor
for our last meeting.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.357
Well, then, Tanaka,
I'll leave them to you.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.859
Got it.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.450
There's one thing
I'd like to ask you, Nagai.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.912
Why do you keep getting in my way?

11:04.414 --> 11:06.082
Isn't it obvious?

11:06.791 --> 11:12.463
As long as you're around,
I'll never be able to live a quiet life.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.301
You're just like me.

11:16.801 --> 11:21.181
I'd rather you didn't lump me in
with insane people like you.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.517
Do it, Ghost!

11:38.698 --> 11:40.700
No, we're the same.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.827
You want to live a quiet life.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.496
I want to play games
to my heart's content.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.750
But this world won't allow that.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.922
Just one more time!

11:54.047 --> 11:55.506
Ghost!

12:02.513 --> 12:06.476
So, we're both doing what we need to do.

12:19.030 --> 12:23.159
Even you aren't indestructible, Nagai.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.744
Kuro-chan!

12:33.878 --> 12:36.839
It's a question of who has
more real battle experience.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.925
Damn it...

12:49.227 --> 12:50.895
Pathetic.

12:53.398 --> 12:57.735
Get away from... Izumi...

12:59.153 --> 13:02.782
This is for what you did
back at the hospital.

13:09.706 --> 13:13.251
Get... away...

13:13.334 --> 13:17.046
from... Ms... Izumi.

13:17.171 --> 13:21.050
What, you too...?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.346
Don't get in my way--

13:38.568 --> 13:39.902
Less than five minutes left.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.821
Release the key lock.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.073
Colonel! It's Sato!

13:44.198 --> 13:45.533
We've found Sato!

13:47.869 --> 13:48.870
Colonel...

13:50.204 --> 13:51.956
Our orders are to use the method

13:52.040 --> 13:55.251
with the highest probability of success
in capturing him.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.559
Do you remember the promise
I made you at the lab, Nagai?

14:12.560 --> 14:15.813
I swore I'd cut off your head.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.942
I'll be following through on that now.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.865
I'll hold up your severed head...

14:26.616 --> 14:29.535
and give you a good view
as your new head is generated...

14:29.619 --> 14:32.455
right up until you die.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.792
You won't be you anymore.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.212
And then...

14:40.088 --> 14:44.634
I promise to give the new you
a really great show.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.096
I'll start with little Eriko.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.307
Next will be Kaito and your parents.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.895
Then Tosaki, Shimomura, Nakano...

14:56.437 --> 15:00.108
I'll kill them all in front of your eyes.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.944
Just like I did at Musashi Industries.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.155
That...

15:07.031 --> 15:10.868
is your punishment for getting in my way.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.377
No.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.005
I'm...

15:25.675 --> 15:28.594
I'll make you a promise too, Mr. Sato.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.391
No matter where you go...

15:34.434 --> 15:37.311
I swear I'll find you and kill you.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.357
This is goodbye,

15:42.108 --> 15:43.693
Nagai!

15:43.818 --> 15:46.028
-Nagai!
-Nagai!

15:59.625 --> 16:02.753
I shouldn't try to save people after all.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.589
We'll work with you!

16:04.672 --> 16:06.299
That was on purpose.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.509
I won't do it.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.052
Just hurry up.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.681
Shut up. I'll say it once more.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.849
Mr. Sato.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.645
Sorry to have caused you so much trouble.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.066
It couldn't be helped.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.067
He was sick.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.237
I've gotta pee.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.240
No! Do you understand
a person's pain?

16:31.365 --> 16:33.326
That's my line.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.746
I'm a worthless human being.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.456
A flood phenomenon...

16:39.874 --> 16:40.917
How many more IBMs can you summon?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.044
You can wait all you want,
but the U.S. military won't be coming.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.505
I'll find you and kill you.

16:45.630 --> 16:49.175
I was only hanging out with him
'cause the poor guy was all alone, anyway.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.966
Hey, Nagai--

17:39.100 --> 17:40.393
Go, go, go!

17:51.862 --> 17:53.239
Don't move!

17:53.322 --> 17:55.908
No, wait, I--

17:55.992 --> 17:57.660
You've got the wrong guy!

17:58.869 --> 17:59.787
Wait!

18:02.873 --> 18:05.835
Those Ajin are under the custody
of the Japanese government.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.338
And that woman is a human
and my subordinate.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.426
Sato and Tanaka.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.637
I believe that was the agreement.

18:22.935 --> 18:23.811
Move out.

18:36.741 --> 18:40.828
The Americans thought better
of using the gas at the last minute.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.663
You should be grateful to Mr. Tosaki.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.751
Your presence will be overlooked
in return for stopping Sato.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.296
He insisted on those absurd terms.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.589
Mr. Tosaki...

18:54.592 --> 18:57.595
Don't forget about pardoning me as well.

19:24.121 --> 19:29.460
<i>A new Ajin protection bill has been</i>
<i>agreed upon by the cabinet this afternoon.</i>

19:30.419 --> 19:33.881
<i>Once the Diet deliberates,</i>
<i>the bill, which will see civil rights</i>

19:33.964 --> 19:37.843
<i>extended to Ajin in actuality as well</i>
<i>as in name, is expected to pass.</i>

19:39.053 --> 19:41.430
<i>It seems</i>
<i>that the violence perpetrated by...</i>

19:41.514 --> 19:44.308
Ms. Nagai,
it's time to take a blood sample.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.105
Oh, did your brother visit again?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.691
-It's so nice that you two are so close.
-Yes.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.403
No, I mean,
we're not really all that close...

19:57.321 --> 19:58.823
That's just what I said to him!

19:58.906 --> 20:00.491
Whoa, way to go!

20:00.574 --> 20:02.743
That is just too crazy.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.830
-Right?
-It's, like, totally hilarious!

20:31.897 --> 20:32.815
Yes...

20:34.942 --> 20:36.360
It's been a while.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.654
What's going on?

20:48.914 --> 20:50.791
Go! Go! Go!

21:07.975 --> 21:09.894
I can't believe he's real.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.147
Yeah, well, I still can't believe it.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.065
He's a human who can't die, man.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.026
How does that work?

21:17.485 --> 21:18.402
Right?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.947
Yeah, it's like something
out of a video game.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.452
You could have a lot of fun
with a body like that.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.462
I haven't dreamed like that in ages.

21:36.587 --> 21:39.465
I can't believe you can sleep so soundly.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.343
We have no idea
what they'll do to us now...

21:42.468 --> 21:44.261
What are you saying?

21:44.845 --> 21:47.890
This is just the beginning
of the second play-through.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.143
And how would we...?

21:54.021 --> 21:58.484
I love it
when a plan comes together, Tanabe.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.500
When did this happen?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.710
<i>Just after the Americans captured them.</i>

22:17.753 --> 22:20.714
They were keeping it under wraps.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.592
I'll give you the details here.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.010
I'm sending a car for you.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.541
<i>Tell me why?</i>
<i>So, somebody tell me</i>

22:55.624 --> 22:58.711
<i>Tell me</i>
<i>Why was I born into this world?</i>

22:58.794 --> 23:02.464
<i>Tell me why?</i>
<i>In this defiled world</i>

23:03.424 --> 23:08.178
<i>But why do you</i>

23:08.262 --> 23:11.432
<i>You always give me a smile</i>

23:12.933 --> 23:16.478
<i>Why do you smile for me?</i>
<i>Let me know</i>

23:16.562 --> 23:17.563
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

23:17.646 --> 23:20.024
<i>One night,</i>
<i>Crying until dawn in the dark</i>

23:20.107 --> 23:22.776
<i>To the light</i>
<i>As I start running now</i>

23:22.860 --> 23:25.946
<i>Keep it tight,</i>
<i>Stop wandering and stop running away</i>

23:26.030 --> 23:27.281
<i>I'mma kick the verse</i>

23:28.324 --> 23:32.244
<i>No compromises,</i>
<i>Whether I live is up to me</i>

23:32.328 --> 23:36.498
<i>Even if my heart is weeping</i>

23:36.582 --> 23:39.335
<i>I want to grasp the thing, I must</i>

23:39.418 --> 23:43.631
<i>Protect</i>
<i>I found the meaning of my life</i>

23:43.714 --> 23:46.967
<i>Until when the light shines</i>

23:47.801 --> 23:52.640
<i>As long as you'll be with me</i>

23:53.265 --> 23:59.521
<i>I can go on living</i>
<i>Forever</i>
