00:05.005 --> 00:06.631
[Latin music playing]

00:26.609 --> 00:28.820
-Mami!
-[screams, panting]

00:28.903 --> 00:31.698
Mami,  where's my biology textbook?

00:31.781 --> 00:34.659
I was studying, then I fell asleep
for two seconds, and it was gone.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.871
Does it have a tree and an Earth

00:37.954 --> 00:39.456
-and the lightning?
-Yes!

00:39.539 --> 00:41.916
-It's in your hand.
-Oh! [chuckles]

00:42.000 --> 00:47.130
Oh, my God! I'm sorry. I need it to study
for my stupid test on Tuesday.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.673
Wait, wait, wait, what day is it?

00:49.257 --> 00:51.718
I showered on Thursday,
so today must be...

00:52.093 --> 00:53.261
[sniffs] Monday.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.472
[groans]

00:56.056 --> 00:56.931
Mami!

00:57.474 --> 01:00.435
I have so much to put in my brain
before tomorrow.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.855
Why? Why does a nurse practitioner have
to know about the life cycle of plants?

01:03.938 --> 01:05.648
I'm not trying to give CPR to a carrot!

01:06.733 --> 01:08.193
And we're out of coffee!

01:08.276 --> 01:11.780
And I don't have time to go shopping,
because after work,

01:11.863 --> 01:14.866
I'll probably have to drive Elena
to another one of her gay protests.

01:14.949 --> 01:18.828
I'm not trying to be insulting...
but a lot of them are about gay stuff.

01:19.579 --> 01:23.500
And then, after my test,
I have to take  papito  to his cello lesson.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.044
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we pay his cello teacher?

01:26.127 --> 01:29.422
Because she sent me three e-mails,
and now I'm not sure what we owe.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.383
I don't trust that lady, Ma.
She never blinks.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.764
[theme song playing]

02:24.352 --> 02:26.980
Okay, come on, everybody, let's go!

02:27.313 --> 02:28.815
Oh, that bath really woke me up.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.276
It started off as a shower,
but then I fell asleep.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.195
I even managed to shave one leg.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.824
I'm coming for you next, lefty.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.286
What, what is this?

02:41.369 --> 02:44.956
When I said take the trash out, I meant
out of the apartment, not out of the can.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.333
Maybe you can show me for next time.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.795
Maybe I can give your PlayStation
to Goodwill.

02:52.046 --> 02:55.300
I don't have time to argue, all right?
Let's go.

02:55.383 --> 02:59.012
Elena! Man, you guys are moving slower
than phosphorous through biomass!

02:59.095 --> 03:00.430
-Yes!
-Oh!

03:02.056 --> 03:04.100
Did you make the appointment
to get my braces off?

03:04.183 --> 03:05.894
-[groans]
-You said you'd do it two weeks ago.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.104
Just eat a lot of taffy,
they'll come off on their own.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.148
Mom, please.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.567
All right, all right.
Let me put it on the to-do list.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.865
Mom, after school can you drive me

03:18.948 --> 03:20.617
to march with
the Lesbians Against Fracking?

03:22.285 --> 03:23.912
I'm sorry, baby, there's no way.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.955
There's no way that's a real thing.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.167
Queer women don't like
our tap water catching fire

03:29.250 --> 03:31.252
any more than anyone else does.
It really matters!

03:31.336 --> 03:33.379
I know, baby,
but so did the Women's March,

03:33.463 --> 03:35.340
the Immigration March,
the Science March...

03:35.423 --> 03:38.343
Ay,  listen to your mother.
This is march madness!

03:40.678 --> 03:42.805
You know, I did like the Women's March.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.934
I looked very nice
in that pink pussycat hat.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.228
That's right.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.313
And we really showed the patriarchy

03:50.396 --> 03:53.191
that men can no longer strut around
with zero self-awareness,

03:53.274 --> 03:55.109
and shove their masculinity in our faces.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.237
Hey, guys.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.704
Schneider, would you please knock...

04:06.788 --> 04:08.665
my eyes out.
What the hell are you wearing?

04:10.625 --> 04:13.336
Oh, this? Yeah, it's my new work uniform.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.213
You're hired.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.803
Oh, Lydia, I was actually inspired
by you teaching dance

04:21.886 --> 04:25.390
to become an educator myself.
I started teaching spinning.

04:26.766 --> 04:30.103
[chuckles] Isn't spinning
riding a stationary bike?

04:30.186 --> 04:31.312
Why are you wearing a helmet?

04:31.396 --> 04:35.066
It's for my own protection.
I may have fallen off a few times.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.568
Anyway, can you post these flyers
for me on campus?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.153
Oh! Are you too busy?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.154
Slammed.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.283
I barely have time to meditate
before my sunset hike.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.914
"Murder Schneider."

04:52.208 --> 04:54.585
-Come on, let's go.
-Wait, I don't have my lunch.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.087
-I don't either.
-[gasps]

04:56.170 --> 05:00.091
Ay! Papito, lo siento!

05:00.174 --> 05:01.551
I forgot.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.885
What about me?

05:02.969 --> 05:05.930
I was just so distracted
with my dance class.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.559
You're teaching ballet to 5-year-olds.
What do you have to prepare for ?

05:10.643 --> 05:13.021
Disappointment. Those kids are terrible.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.649
Wait, here, here. Here is your lunch.

05:17.859 --> 05:18.943
Here you go.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.611
Why does she get 10 bucks and I get 5?

05:20.695 --> 05:22.405
Take out the freakin' trash. Let's go.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.869
I'm sorry, I know I'm late.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.414
Well, no.
Actually, it's 8:00 a.m. on the dot.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.708
[both] Early is on time. On time is late.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.047
Sorry, my personal motto isn't,
"That's what she said."

05:40.256 --> 05:43.092
Hey. My personal motto is,
"Swipe right on life."

05:44.677 --> 05:47.221
So school's really keeping you busy, huh?

05:47.305 --> 05:49.891
Yeah, when are you gonna hook me up
with some hot coeds?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.895
Or are they all... returning students?

05:53.978 --> 05:57.357
Uh... you mean people
who are gonna be your boss soon?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.692
Yeah, I don't think that's how it works.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.319
Oh, that's exactly how it works, Scott!

06:01.402 --> 06:02.487
I'm gonna go do my job.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.113
Make me coffee
'cause I'm gonna be your boss?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.031
Yeah, you go do that.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.492
That's what she said!

06:10.828 --> 06:14.082
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Hey, someone call the doctor!

06:16.667 --> 06:18.628
I'm just so worn out.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.342
I got school on top of everything else.
It's got Mama beat.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.470
[sighs] I must look like hell.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.139
-You have been looking--
-Mama don't need to hear that, Doc.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.227
Well, I know where you're coming from.

06:34.310 --> 06:39.357
I don't do very much and Daddy's been
exhausted for the last 35 years.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.610
Yeah, let's not keep doing
that Mama-Daddy thing.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.448
Can I confess something to you, Doc?

06:47.532 --> 06:48.449
Yeah.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.618
[sighs] School is hard!

06:51.911 --> 06:53.830
I got good grades in high school,
but that was my mom.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.289
She used to stand over me while I studied,

06:55.373 --> 06:58.292
and if I nodded off,
she'd squirt me with a spray bottle.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.587
She sprays me, too.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.257
With cologne.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.510
Says I'm not a man
unless I smell like the inside of a boot.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.766
This whole nurse practitioner thing is
a real game changer for my whole family.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.311
There's a lot of pressure,
and honestly, it is kicking my butt.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.814
And then the professor
thanked me for correcting her

07:19.897 --> 07:21.399
and the whole class applauded.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.985
[Scott groans] We get it!

07:25.820 --> 07:27.780
I'm sorry. One of the only joys I have

07:27.864 --> 07:30.116
is making sure he knows
I am better than him.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.578
You are, girlfriend.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.207
You are Superwoman. Hear you roar.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.210
You go, girl.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.050
Doc, can I confess something else
about school?

07:50.094 --> 07:52.180
[in high-pitched voice]
I'm kind of failing.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.308
[laughs]

07:55.391 --> 07:58.728
Right! You failing? I can see that.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.147
"I got an A-minus, oy!

08:02.648 --> 08:03.941
Dios mío."

08:06.068 --> 08:10.615
Look. All I know is, I believe in you.

08:11.741 --> 08:16.329
Which is why I've already leased
the office next door

08:16.412 --> 08:19.582
so we can expand the practice
to accommodate all the new patients

08:19.665 --> 08:22.710
that you are going to be bringing in.
Surprise!

08:22.793 --> 08:23.961
What?

08:24.045 --> 08:26.422
That's the face I was looking for!

08:27.590 --> 08:30.510
[gasps] I can't believe you did that.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.554
Yeah, I'm putting all my eggs
in Mama's basket.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.642
There's no going back now!

08:37.725 --> 08:44.357
Literally, the future of this office rests
on these shoulders. [chuckles]

08:44.440 --> 08:46.150
Boy, you are tight.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.825
Alex...

08:54.909 --> 09:00.039
-[ballet music playing]
-And chins up, and shoulders back.

09:00.122 --> 09:04.335
Chassé, chassé, chaîné turn.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.128
Oh, that is so good.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.172
[laughs] Hopeless.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.593
I really need to study. What happened
to finding a space at the church?

09:12.677 --> 09:15.179
I would never put God through this.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.016
Everything is very expensive,

09:19.100 --> 09:23.020
so I'm going to wait until after
you graduate and you get your big raise.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.231
Sasha, no biting!

09:25.898 --> 09:27.984
That one is going to make it.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.152
Okay, snack time, children.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.990
Look at them, so excited about food.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.950
They will never be dancers.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.327
Where's Alex?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.080
In my room, practicing the cello.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.710
Oh, hey.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.004
Oh, yeah.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.383
No, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no.
That's my work space.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.635
-Sorry, Mom, I really need the table.
-For what?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.470
‘Cause this ain't homework.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.932
I'm planning on starting a GSA at school.
A Gay-Straight Alliance.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.350
Are you gay?

10:01.434 --> 10:04.103
I forgot because you haven't mentioned it
in the last five minutes.

10:05.396 --> 10:09.025
Papito,  trash, cello,
then making fun of your sister.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.445
Anyway...

10:14.363 --> 10:17.658
I'm expecting a big pushback
from the Catholic school administration.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.035
I'm getting a jump on the protest.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.747
And I've been practicing my angry,
staring-down-nuns look.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.377
That's more a "someone
at the office stole my yogurt" face,

10:28.461 --> 10:30.254
but you keep working on it. Not here.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.883
I don't understand
why do you need a gay club.

10:33.966 --> 10:39.221
We get it. You're here, you're queer,
we're used to it. Move on!

10:39.305 --> 10:42.433
Abuelita,  what if someone told you
not to talk about being Cuban?

10:42.516 --> 10:45.686
I would kick them in the  aguacates,
why do you ask?

10:45.770 --> 10:48.439
Mami,  did you make
my braces appointment yet?

10:48.522 --> 10:49.440
No, I didn't.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.608
Mom, have you seen that--

10:50.691 --> 10:53.736
Can everyone just get off my back
and do what you're supposed to be doing?

10:53.819 --> 10:55.946
-Oh, chill out.
-Jeez.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.574
Mom, why are you so uptight?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.410
I'm sorry. But I'm working
my sweet  nalguitas  off,

11:01.494 --> 11:02.703
and you guys should be, too!

11:03.871 --> 11:06.666
That's why I'm at the top of my class!
I'm just being real with you!

11:07.166 --> 11:09.418
Cálmate, niña.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.378
[scoffs]

11:11.128 --> 11:12.129
"Calm down"?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.924
Are you the same woman
who broke out the  chancleta

11:15.007 --> 11:17.259
while I was memorizing the states?

11:17.343 --> 11:20.763
-'Cause I'll never be able to forget it.
-You hit  Mami  with your  chancleta?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.598
Oh, please, I would never.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.393
It's just a learning tool.
It's all about the sound.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.728
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona!
Okay, put that away!

11:28.687 --> 11:29.855
[sighs]

11:29.939 --> 11:32.400
Everybody, go do your work
so I can do mine.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.276
No interruptions.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.781
Let's go dance some more!

11:38.864 --> 11:42.326
Okay. Chassé. Who can do a chassé?

11:42.410 --> 11:46.372
And who can do a beautiful leap
like a deer?

11:46.455 --> 11:49.291
Who can do that? Who can do a chaîné?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.502
Oh! That is so beautiful!

11:51.585 --> 11:54.505
Dance with your hearts.
Dance with your souls.

11:55.089 --> 11:58.175
Thank you for letting me study here.
It's so peaceful.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.929
You don't realize how much noise there is
until there is no noise.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.222
-Yeah, it's kinda--
-[shushes]

12:05.224 --> 12:08.811
I have a huge test tomorrow.
I really need you to let me work, okay?

12:08.894 --> 12:11.689
I get it. [chuckles]

12:11.981 --> 12:13.482
I got work, too.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.609
[clears throat]

12:15.693 --> 12:19.071
See, the key to effective spinning is
a great music playlist.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.199
This one I'm working on right now
is tiger-themed.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.828
So far I've got "Eye Of The Tiger"

12:25.911 --> 12:28.956
and that Katy Perry song where she says,
"Eye of the tiger."

12:34.336 --> 12:36.255
-You wanna hear my playlist?
-Shut up!

12:38.549 --> 12:41.427
Okay. [scoffs]
I guess it's suddenly cool

12:41.510 --> 12:44.430
to walk into somebody else's apartment
and treat it like it's your own.

13:03.699 --> 13:04.909
[sobs]

13:06.285 --> 13:07.119
[sighs]

Okay, I decided to take a break
from dating.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.322
See, I realized that women were just
another one of my addictions,

gambling, cigarettes, snow globes.
