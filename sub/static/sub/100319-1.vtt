Hi, Mo.

00:40.939 --> 00:42.375
Morning. Quick question.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.921
Do you always have to play and
sing your music quite that loud?

00:45.946 --> 00:47.846
Well, how else am I
supposed to listen to Wham!?

00:47.871 --> 00:49.392
Their songs demand a certain level

00:49.417 --> 00:50.953
of participation and volume.

00:50.978 --> 00:53.289
It's just that I have a
huge day at work today,

00:53.314 --> 00:54.836
and that sound booming through my walls

00:54.860 --> 00:56.227
wasn't really the best way to start it.

00:56.251 --> 00:57.650
Know what I mean?

00:58.710 --> 01:00.334
Why are you up so early, anyway?

01:00.359 --> 01:01.578
Oh, I didn't go to bed.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.373
At midnight, I had this idea
for a whole line of caftans,

01:04.399 --> 01:05.865
and, you know,
when inspiration strikes...

01:05.867 --> 01:07.901
Hey, what music are you listening to?

01:07.903 --> 01:09.736
I'm happy to take requests
for the next time.

01:09.738 --> 01:11.838
Sorry. You wouldn't know the band.

01:12.054 --> 01:13.673
<i>On today's "Analog Dialogue,"</i>

01:13.675 --> 01:16.031
<i>we have M.I.T. Fellow
and robotics specialist,</i>

01:16.056 --> 01:19.117
<i>Dr. Grace Simmons Hartley,
discussing her...</i>

01:23.184 --> 01:24.695
So, you ready for this?

01:24.720 --> 01:27.430
I think so. I mean,
I do have a pounding headache

01:27.455 --> 01:29.625
and a teeny bit of vomit
in the back of my throat,

01:29.650 --> 01:31.475
- but, like, in a good way.
- Okay.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.435
I just really don't
want to screw this up.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.351
- Next!
- I will have a nonfat latte.

01:36.376 --> 01:38.443
And I'll have a coffee, black.

01:38.726 --> 01:40.771
Keeping it lean for the ladies.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.021
It actually says that
on his dating profile.

01:43.046 --> 01:44.437
It does.

01:44.710 --> 01:46.406
I still don't think it's right for Joan

01:46.408 --> 01:47.969
to force us all to go
after this promotion.

01:47.993 --> 01:50.625
We're not all management material,
and I'm fine with that.

01:50.650 --> 01:52.453
I'm not. I've been a coder long enough.

01:52.478 --> 01:54.553
I need to expand my horizons.

01:54.578 --> 01:55.750
Ooh, that's good.

01:55.775 --> 01:57.282
And then you should tell
her how you crushed it

01:57.306 --> 01:59.235
designing the interface for
our new photo-sharing app.

01:59.259 --> 02:01.598
Except that was really
more of a group effort.

02:01.623 --> 02:03.085
No, it was not a group effort.

02:03.110 --> 02:04.748
It was literally all you.

02:04.773 --> 02:06.593
Now is not the time to be modest.

02:06.595 --> 02:08.595
Joan would be lucky to
have you managing the team,

02:08.620 --> 02:10.764
but you're gonna have to convince her.

02:11.287 --> 02:12.804
Just don't let her rattle you.

02:12.829 --> 02:15.296
Stay confident.
Try to compliment her a little bit,

02:15.321 --> 02:17.406
because let's face it,
the woman's a narcissist.

02:17.431 --> 02:19.718
All very good and thorough advice.

02:21.554 --> 02:23.437
- Hey.
- Howdy.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.718
Did you just say,
"Howdy," to the new guy?

02:26.743 --> 02:29.281
That, I did. I don't know why
we need to keep reliving it.

02:29.306 --> 02:30.726
Why don't you just talk to him?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.437
I'm sure he's perfectly nice.

02:32.462 --> 02:35.390
I'm sure he is, too,
but I have a long history of...

02:35.415 --> 02:37.126
What do you call my past
relationships again?

02:37.150 --> 02:39.336
Unnecessarily complicated,
exhausting for everybody,

02:39.361 --> 02:40.560
the opposite of good.

02:40.562 --> 02:41.960
Yeah, those things.

02:41.985 --> 02:45.326
Which is why, this time,
I'm gonna just take things slow

02:45.351 --> 02:46.537
and wait for the right in.

02:47.092 --> 02:48.092
How does she look?

02:48.117 --> 02:49.469
Good mood or bad mood?

02:49.471 --> 02:51.140
Uh, I'm gonna say all the moods.

02:51.165 --> 02:53.031
Your guess is as good as mine.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.454
Okay.

02:57.479 --> 02:58.978
Okay, look at me.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.780
This is it. Work your magic.

03:00.782 --> 03:02.882
Feel the glory. In it to win it.

03:04.732 --> 03:06.164
I don't know why I'm nervous.

03:06.189 --> 03:08.423
So, Zoey, tell me why you think

03:08.448 --> 03:10.767
you're manager of engineering material.

03:10.792 --> 03:12.492
Great question, Joan.

03:13.243 --> 03:15.454
To start with, I think that I proved
my programming skills

03:15.478 --> 03:17.569
when I helped design the interface
for our photo-sharing app.

03:17.593 --> 03:18.965
Okay, but how much of your work

03:18.967 --> 03:21.187
personally contributed to that project?

03:21.515 --> 03:23.980
- You want, like, a percentage?
- No, I want a latte.

03:24.005 --> 03:25.804
Yes, I want to know how
significant you feel

03:25.829 --> 03:28.623
your contribution was in
terms of the end results.

03:28.648 --> 03:31.398
Well, I mean,
it was definitely a group effort,

03:31.423 --> 03:34.014
but if I had to give
you a concrete number,

03:34.039 --> 03:37.539
I guess I would say... six.

03:37.564 --> 03:38.764
Six?

03:38.789 --> 03:40.156
- ... ty...
- 60?

03:40.181 --> 03:41.905
- ... four?
- 64%?

03:41.930 --> 03:43.129
Correct.

03:45.239 --> 03:46.828
Technical accomplishments aside,

03:46.853 --> 03:48.919
what makes you think you
would be a good manager?

03:48.944 --> 03:50.765
Are you an effective communicator?

03:50.790 --> 03:52.766
Do you think you can get
others to follow your lead?

03:52.790 --> 03:54.976
Are you comfortable being the bad guy?

03:56.202 --> 03:58.373
Well, I'm not really
comfortable with anything.

03:58.398 --> 03:59.882
That's why I became a coder.

04:03.215 --> 04:05.549
But that doesn't mean I
couldn't be a great manager

04:05.574 --> 04:07.382
if given the chance.

04:08.850 --> 04:10.334
What are you typing?

04:10.359 --> 04:11.951
My Pilates instructor.

04:11.953 --> 04:13.656
Can't be late again, Jeff.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.067
Leif, you've been summoned.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.320
How'd you do?

04:21.345 --> 04:24.257
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say not well.

04:24.282 --> 04:26.776
Really? I thought you two
would be doing each other's nails

04:26.801 --> 04:29.053
and buying matching tote
bags off Etsy in there.

04:29.078 --> 04:31.084
Dude, come on. Not cool.

04:31.109 --> 04:33.443
What? What?

04:33.468 --> 04:34.640
I'm sorry.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.776
Yeah, me, too. I was really hoping

04:36.801 --> 04:39.125
I'd have some good
news to tell my father.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.129
All right, who wants
some freshly delivered,

04:56.131 --> 04:57.986
slightly cold, mediocre pizza?

04:58.011 --> 04:59.398
Mom? Zoey?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.433
Maybe later.

05:00.435 --> 05:02.871
All right. Well, more for me.

05:05.535 --> 05:08.019
Mom, let me take over. You need a break.

05:08.044 --> 05:10.053
No, that's not why we
have you guys here.

05:10.078 --> 05:11.621
We just like the company.

05:11.646 --> 05:14.057
Okay. Well, I can still feed Dad soup.

05:14.082 --> 05:16.048
Yes, but your father doesn't want

05:16.050 --> 05:18.050
to burden you with any of this stuff.

05:20.652 --> 05:22.564
How do you know? He can't speak.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.920
Well, I don't know for sure,

05:23.922 --> 05:26.556
but I have been married
to the man for 40 years,

05:26.558 --> 05:29.299
so I have a pretty good idea.

05:29.324 --> 05:31.252
Can we maybe open a window or something?

05:31.277 --> 05:33.387
Why? You want Dad to catch
a cold on top of everything else?

05:33.411 --> 05:35.409
Yeah, that's exactly
what I want for him.

05:35.434 --> 05:36.599
- Guys.
- He just always loved

05:36.601 --> 05:37.834
being outside, and I don't know.

05:37.836 --> 05:39.002
I thought maybe a little fresh air...

05:39.004 --> 05:40.730
Might give him pneumonia?

05:41.312 --> 05:42.886
He's fine, Zoey.

05:46.886 --> 05:49.182
What's the matter, sweetie? You okay?

05:49.207 --> 05:51.514
Yeah, I've just been getting headaches

05:51.516 --> 05:53.783
and maybe a little bit
of eye pain lately.

05:53.785 --> 05:55.371
I'm sure it's nothing.

05:55.566 --> 05:57.033
Oh, so you're not thinking

05:57.058 --> 05:59.432
that you have what your father has?

05:59.457 --> 06:01.863
I mean, it might have crossed
my mind once or twice.

06:01.888 --> 06:04.504
He didn't show symptoms
until about a year ago,

06:04.529 --> 06:06.596
and it started with balance issues

06:06.598 --> 06:09.418
and speech problems,
not stress headaches.

06:09.443 --> 06:12.410
But, if you're really worried,
go see a doctor, and get an MRI.

06:12.435 --> 06:14.548
No way.
You know how claustrophobic I am.

06:14.573 --> 06:16.106
Well, so is your father,

06:16.108 --> 06:19.506
and he's had seven since January.

06:19.531 --> 06:22.066
Three more,
we get a set of steak knives.

06:24.254 --> 06:26.054
They're not that scary.

06:29.334 --> 06:31.761
Are you sure this isn't
an elaborate teleportation device

06:31.786 --> 06:33.754
that's going to take me
to some parallel universe?

06:33.779 --> 06:35.502
Depends. Where do you want to go?

06:35.527 --> 06:39.261
Um, I'm gonna vote
for anywhere but here.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.809
Uh, now, you're gonna hear some banging,

06:42.833 --> 06:44.832
uh, but you can listen
to music if you like.

06:44.857 --> 06:46.636
We've got Spotify, Pandora,

06:48.614 --> 06:50.447

Why are you singing right now?

12:17.135 --> 12:19.446
Because I love that song,
and it feels good to sing it.

12:19.471 --> 12:21.741
So you weren't just singing
that to me specifically?

12:21.766 --> 12:23.906
Why would I be singing to you?
You don't even like me.

12:23.908 --> 12:26.657
That's never been officially documented.

12:26.682 --> 12:29.016
Zoey, are you okay? Do you need some...

12:29.041 --> 12:31.696
Ahh! Don't say the word "help."
I'm begging you.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.445
Please, come on in.

12:35.470 --> 12:37.620
Can I get you anything? Water?

12:37.622 --> 12:40.063
Vodka? Xanax?

12:42.210 --> 12:44.212
Okay, maybe I do need help,

12:44.237 --> 12:46.570
because I think I'm going crazy.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.991
Did you want to tell me about it?

12:50.016 --> 12:53.015
People are singing to me, Mo.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.450
An entire neighborhood just
sang a whole Beatles song to me.

12:57.475 --> 12:58.977
Quick question.

12:59.002 --> 13:01.524
Did you recently imbibe
or ingest anything

13:01.549 --> 13:03.298
that came from a "medicinal" type shop?

13:03.323 --> 13:04.958
No. All I know is that, one second,

13:04.983 --> 13:06.361
I'm getting an MRI,
and, the next second...

13:06.385 --> 13:08.119
Complete strangers are
singing John Lennon to you.

13:08.143 --> 13:10.477
Some to me, some to themselves,

13:10.743 --> 13:12.321
almost as if they were singing

13:12.323 --> 13:14.457
what they were all thinking out loud

13:14.482 --> 13:16.860
collectively as a people.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.259
Does that make sense?

13:19.284 --> 13:21.597
No, but I'm an open-minded person.

13:21.599 --> 13:23.448
I'm willing to roll with this.

13:23.914 --> 13:26.980
Maybe you're operating on
a higher plane than the rest of us.

13:27.005 --> 13:29.722
Maybe you're getting a special glimpse
into other people's heads.

13:30.221 --> 13:31.221
If that's the case,

13:31.246 --> 13:32.966
then why aren't you
singing to me right now?

13:33.288 --> 13:35.052
Child, I'm completely baked.

13:35.077 --> 13:37.144
Ain't nothing going on
in my head right now.

13:38.219 --> 13:40.314
You know what? Forget it.

13:40.339 --> 13:42.051
Forget I said any of this.

13:42.053 --> 13:44.181
I shouldn't have told you.
I shouldn't tell anyone.

13:44.206 --> 13:45.454
Keeping my mouth shut from now on,

13:45.456 --> 13:46.581
or else rumors get started,

13:46.606 --> 13:48.276
and then I become the weird music girl

13:48.301 --> 13:49.703
on top of everything else,
and I've got enough problems

13:49.727 --> 13:51.093
without that, thank you very much.

13:51.095 --> 13:53.429
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I am really sorry

13:53.431 --> 13:55.031
that you got so freaked out, okay?

13:55.033 --> 13:57.967
And let me know if it
ever happens again,

13:57.969 --> 13:59.969
because this is the first thing

13:59.971 --> 14:02.612
that I find remotely
interesting about you.

14:27.669 --> 14:29.065
I don't think I've ever been as happy

14:29.067 --> 14:31.403
as that guy is at 9:30 in
the morning on a Tuesday.

14:31.428 --> 14:33.847
He does have a certain
joie de vivre, doesn't he?

14:33.872 --> 14:35.161
Have we ever had joie de vivre?

14:35.186 --> 14:36.917
I don't think we're really
joie de vivre people.

14:36.941 --> 14:39.508
There you guys are.
Joan is in rare form today.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.004
- Come on.
- Wait, wait. What's happening?

14:41.028 --> 14:43.591
You mean she didn't tell you
over Skinnygirl margaritas last night?

14:43.615 --> 14:45.715
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

14:45.717 --> 14:47.082
My mom left me when I was young,

14:47.107 --> 14:48.544
and my whole life has been
a series of rejections

14:48.568 --> 14:51.920
from the opposite sex.
Any other questions?

14:51.945 --> 14:54.746
Yes, I have many, many questions.

14:58.995 --> 15:00.628
_

15:00.653 --> 15:02.098
For those of you who don't know,

15:02.100 --> 15:04.767
we have recently discovered
a bug in the health app

15:04.769 --> 15:06.769
that's supposed to launch in five days

15:06.771 --> 15:08.651
along with the new Sprq Point watch.

15:08.676 --> 15:09.692
What's the bug doing?

15:09.717 --> 15:11.905
It's giving inaccurate readings
of people's blood pressure,

15:11.929 --> 15:13.638
most in the range of 50 over 20.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.588
That's low, isn't it?

15:15.613 --> 15:18.113
Only if should no
longer be living is low.

15:18.138 --> 15:19.982
So, I'm gonna need you guys

15:19.984 --> 15:22.551
to text your friends and
your Adderall dealers

15:22.553 --> 15:24.240
and all the other entitled millennials

15:24.265 --> 15:26.326
you've been chatting with
on Slack and tell them

15:26.351 --> 15:27.982
you're gonna be in for some late nights.

15:28.007 --> 15:29.349
Get to work.

15:34.179 --> 15:36.609
I don't think it's coming from our end.

15:36.634 --> 15:39.168
- Our app code seems fine.
- Must have something to do

15:39.170 --> 15:41.740
with how the watch itself
is recording the data.

15:41.765 --> 15:43.943
I'm gonna clone its firmware repository.

15:43.968 --> 15:46.326
- I can help if you want.
- Thanks, Leif.

You actually came to my gig.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.035
You told me to tell
you if happens again.

18:04.060 --> 18:05.144
All day, nothing, and then,

18:05.169 --> 18:08.252
out of nowhere, it happened again.

18:08.277 --> 18:09.988
What now? A bunch of cartoon birds

18:10.013 --> 18:12.093
land on your shoulders and
sing show tunes to you?

18:12.118 --> 18:13.933
No, this was just one person

18:13.958 --> 18:17.131
singing something so raw
and painful and personal,

18:17.156 --> 18:19.494
I almost felt embarrassed
listening to it.

18:19.519 --> 18:20.891
What do you think that means?

18:20.893 --> 18:22.363
One of two things,

18:22.388 --> 18:24.205
either your powers are getting stronger,

18:24.230 --> 18:27.666
honing on specific targets,
or you're losing it,

18:27.691 --> 18:29.496
in which case, I will do my civic duty

18:29.521 --> 18:31.445
and drive you to the nearest
mental health clinic

18:31.470 --> 18:34.330
as soon as I'm finished making
seventies night my bitch.

18:34.355 --> 18:36.332
I am just very, very confused.

18:36.357 --> 18:39.186
You said that I was getting a glimpse
into other people's heads.

18:39.211 --> 18:41.278
I said maybe you were,
and you should really take

18:41.280 --> 18:43.145
everything I say when I'm
high with a grain of salt.

18:43.169 --> 18:44.325
But it just doesn't make sense.

18:44.349 --> 18:46.794
The guy who was singing
is handsome and happy

18:46.819 --> 18:50.080
and charming and very, very sexy,

18:50.105 --> 18:52.082
and, if your theory is correct,

18:52.107 --> 18:54.674
then he should only be singing,
like, massively upbeat anthems

18:54.699 --> 18:56.466
about how totally awesome he is.

18:56.491 --> 18:59.098
Well, maybe he's not quite
as awesome as you think he is.

18:59.123 --> 19:00.588
What was he singing?

19:00.613 --> 19:02.551
I think it's called "Mad World."

19:02.576 --> 19:05.776
Mm. Your boy is hurting.
That song is real dark.

19:05.801 --> 19:07.938
Look, songs are all just an expression

19:07.940 --> 19:09.754
of our deepest wants and desires...

19:09.779 --> 19:14.816
Joy, pain, heartbreak,
yearning, forgiveness, revenge.

19:14.841 --> 19:16.507
Good music can make you feel things

19:16.532 --> 19:18.176
you can't express in words.

19:18.201 --> 19:22.163
So, if I do have this... power,

19:22.188 --> 19:24.035
maybe Simon really is hurting.

19:24.060 --> 19:26.387
And the song that he sang only to you

19:26.412 --> 19:28.512
might have been his cry for help.

19:28.537 --> 19:29.537
Hmm?

19:32.447 --> 19:35.840
_

19:44.652 --> 19:47.277
I can't find anything.

19:47.279 --> 19:49.471
No memory leak,
no out-of-bounds exception,

19:49.496 --> 19:51.191
not even a floating-point error.

19:51.216 --> 19:53.317
Hey, uh, not that I'm
keeping tabs or anything,

19:53.342 --> 19:55.408
but that's like your
fourth cup of coffee today.

19:55.454 --> 19:57.020
How late were you here last night?

19:57.022 --> 19:58.285
Oh, I wasn't just here.

19:58.310 --> 20:00.901
I went to this club
called The Make Out Place.

20:00.926 --> 20:03.246
You went to a club?

20:03.271 --> 20:04.905
I'll be right back.

20:04.930 --> 20:06.512
Okay.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.957
Club. What's next, Burning Man?

20:25.184 --> 20:26.902
What are you leaning towards?

20:27.871 --> 20:30.127
Tough call. Middle of the day.

20:30.152 --> 20:32.324
Do I get a sugar cereal
that'll make me crash hard

20:32.349 --> 20:34.502
or something super healthy
that I'll totally hate?

20:34.527 --> 20:36.644
These are the struggles.

20:37.079 --> 20:40.174
My dad's a huge fa...
Well, was a huge fan of granola.

20:40.199 --> 20:42.441
I think I'm gonna go that route.

20:42.466 --> 20:44.441
It's kinda the best of
both worlds scenario.

20:44.996 --> 20:46.558
What made your dad turn on granola?

20:46.583 --> 20:47.645
Did granola hurt him in some way?

20:47.669 --> 20:49.371
Rob his house? Make out with his lady?

20:49.396 --> 20:52.308
No. He just, uh, can't really swallow

20:52.333 --> 20:53.707
anymore, because he's dying.

20:53.732 --> 20:55.690
Well, slowly dying of this
rare neurological disease,

20:55.714 --> 20:58.315
and each week, he, like,
loses another ability,

20:58.340 --> 20:59.817
therefore, big chunks of granola

20:59.819 --> 21:01.683
would just cause him to choke.

21:01.708 --> 21:06.010
So, that's a whole lot of
TMI I just spewed at you.

21:06.035 --> 21:07.424
I-I'm sorry. I had no idea.

21:07.426 --> 21:08.505
Why would you? We're strangers.

21:08.529 --> 21:09.606
There's no way you could know that,

21:09.630 --> 21:10.966
just like there's no way I could know

21:10.990 --> 21:12.973
if you were secretly
miserable or something.

21:12.998 --> 21:15.213
I mean, you seem happy, but who knows

21:15.238 --> 21:18.915
what other people
are really thinking, right?

21:18.940 --> 21:21.478
Anyway, I'm Zoey.
I don't know if you know that,

21:21.503 --> 21:23.818
and, if you want to forget
this entire interaction

21:23.843 --> 21:26.335
ever happened, totally get it.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.593
Zoey...

21:29.775 --> 21:31.348
we can do better than cereal.

21:31.350 --> 21:32.697
You wanna take a walk?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.662
Yeah.

21:34.687 --> 21:36.720
You were right.

21:36.722 --> 21:39.323
This was the best
cheesecake I've ever had.

21:39.325 --> 21:41.126
Uh-uh, cheesequake.

21:41.151 --> 21:44.071
- Cheesequake.
- Ah.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.707
Still, isn't it in
bad taste for a bakery

21:46.732 --> 21:48.799
to capitalize off natural disasters

21:48.801 --> 21:50.462
with a moderately clever pun?

21:50.487 --> 21:51.679
Oh, definitely in bad taste,

21:51.704 --> 21:53.798
but, when they're as
good as these were...

21:53.823 --> 21:56.220
Unh... do we really care?

21:56.948 --> 21:59.111
- No.
- Hmm.

22:01.702 --> 22:04.291
So, are you usually that honest

22:04.316 --> 22:06.579
about your dad and his condition?

22:06.604 --> 22:09.681
Not so much. I've found, in general,

22:09.706 --> 22:12.445
death and dying tend not to be
the best conversation starters.

22:12.470 --> 22:14.958
Still, are you angry?
Are you crying all the time?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.797
What's that whole process like for you?

22:16.822 --> 22:18.283
Why are you asking?

22:19.041 --> 22:21.119
Is one of your parents dying, too?

22:21.144 --> 22:22.861
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

22:28.142 --> 22:29.173
If I show you something,

22:29.198 --> 22:31.236
can you promise to keep
it only between us?

22:37.108 --> 22:41.922
This is a photo of my dad
and I when I was a kid.

22:41.947 --> 22:44.329
I've been carrying it
everywhere I go lately.

22:45.302 --> 22:48.587
And you don't want others to
know about this, because...

22:48.612 --> 22:51.361
He killed himself, Zoey.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.986
Five months ago.

22:54.011 --> 22:55.743
Looking at this photo

22:55.768 --> 22:57.534
is the only thing that
makes me feel better.

23:00.380 --> 23:04.003
And I know what you're
going through sucks, but it's...

23:05.297 --> 23:07.264
it's way worse when they're gone.

23:07.547 --> 23:10.086
I mean, your dad's still here.
You gotta take advantage of that.

23:10.111 --> 23:11.748
Talk to him.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.037
Hold his hand. Do things with him.

23:14.062 --> 23:16.396
'Cause, when he's gone, well, it's...

23:18.904 --> 23:23.283
Uh, this is the only thing
that I could hold on to.

23:25.413 --> 23:27.329
I'm so sorry.

23:30.603 --> 23:33.047
Are you talking to anyone about this?

23:33.525 --> 23:35.564
Other than you? No.

23:36.299 --> 23:39.219
I've become a real expert at
bottling my shame and pain

23:39.244 --> 23:41.431
and hiding it from the world.

23:42.858 --> 23:44.366
Listen,

23:44.391 --> 23:49.063
I'm not an expert on this or anything,

23:49.088 --> 23:51.343
but you can't just keep it in.

23:55.123 --> 23:59.306
We live in a very,
very mad world, Simon,

23:59.331 --> 24:02.032
but if you open up and express
what you're feeling to others,

24:02.034 --> 24:05.335
well, I mean, it's gotta be better

24:05.337 --> 24:07.022
than what you're doing now.

24:07.921 --> 24:09.640
Living your whole life in your head,

24:09.665 --> 24:13.859
like this prison
my dad's now in, that's...

24:15.026 --> 24:16.351
... torture.

24:18.523 --> 24:20.342
You're amazing.

24:20.367 --> 24:23.382
It's like you know exactly
what's going on inside my brain.

24:26.602 --> 24:29.104
It's a real miracle
we found each other, Zoey.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.760
Yeah.

24:32.496 --> 24:34.736
Such a miracle.

24:38.557 --> 24:41.446
These are all the pills Dad's taking?

24:41.471 --> 24:43.337
Yes. I had to make a spreadsheet

24:43.362 --> 24:45.666
just to keep track,
which pill, which hour.

24:45.691 --> 24:49.518
I-I could do a whole PowerPoint
presentation on this right now.

24:49.543 --> 24:51.494
You would be very impressed.

24:51.519 --> 24:54.150
I'm just impressed
you know the term "PowerPoint."

24:54.175 --> 24:55.924
Well, what do they all do?

24:55.949 --> 24:59.186
Um, okay, well,
this one helped me sleep.

24:59.211 --> 25:01.127
This one made me forget all my problems

25:01.152 --> 25:02.588
for about five hours,

25:02.613 --> 25:03.628
- and this one...
- Mom, you've tried them?

25:03.652 --> 25:06.011
No. Yes. Some of them.

25:07.317 --> 25:09.510
That is so unlike you.

25:09.535 --> 25:11.702
I know. I just...

25:11.786 --> 25:14.400
I wanted to feel what
your dad was feeling.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.058
That's all.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.955
So, what is new with you?

25:19.980 --> 25:23.041
Oh, nothing much.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.721
Well, I left the office
in the middle of a crisis

25:25.746 --> 25:29.881
to spend time with this coworker
I have a massive crush on.

25:30.301 --> 25:31.721
Then I used information

25:31.746 --> 25:33.299
I shouldn't have even known about him

25:33.324 --> 25:37.250
to form this bond like some
sort of adorable psycho.

25:37.275 --> 25:39.385
That is so unlike you.

25:39.410 --> 25:42.291
I just haven't been myself lately,

25:42.899 --> 25:47.061
and I'm worried about you
and Dad all the time, and...

25:50.094 --> 25:51.720
What?

25:51.745 --> 25:53.330
What did I say?

25:57.746 --> 26:00.885
No, nothing. It's not you.

26:00.910 --> 26:02.666
This is all just...

26:04.195 --> 26:06.166
very overwhelming.

26:07.980 --> 26:11.174
I mean, six months ago, Dad was...

26:11.573 --> 26:13.025
he was okay.

26:13.050 --> 26:15.502
You know, we could still
communicate with each other,

26:15.527 --> 26:19.065
and now I don't know what's
going on in his head,

26:19.090 --> 26:22.643
how much he's processing,
if he's processing.

26:23.612 --> 26:25.946
I should have been the
one this happened to.

26:25.971 --> 26:28.346
- Don't say that.
- No, it is true.

26:28.371 --> 26:30.174
I mean, your dad was
always better than me

26:30.199 --> 26:33.104
at handling emergencies, all the...

26:33.970 --> 26:36.471
emotional stuff, and we all know it.

26:36.496 --> 26:38.830
Okay, if that's the case,

26:38.855 --> 26:44.174
then maybe we should ask him how
to handle our current situation.

26:52.255 --> 26:56.090
I think we're just gonna have
to stumble through it together.

26:56.303 --> 26:58.096
The blind leading the blind.

26:58.121 --> 27:00.910
- Jinx.
- No take-backs.

27:06.214 --> 27:08.949
If you had the power to
know what was going on

27:08.974 --> 27:13.877
in other people's heads,
do you think you'd feel guilty?

27:14.417 --> 27:17.347
No, I think I'd just get
my feelings hurt a lot more often.

27:17.372 --> 27:20.006
There she is, my favorite mind-reader.

27:21.408 --> 27:23.349
That's me...

27:23.374 --> 27:25.007
Zo-stradamus.

27:25.032 --> 27:28.136
I just wanted to say thank you
again for our talk yesterday,

27:28.161 --> 27:30.361
and I'm here for you, too,

27:30.386 --> 27:32.246
if you ever need someone to lean on.

27:32.271 --> 27:34.441
- I mean that.
- Great. Sounds good.

27:34.466 --> 27:35.910
Will definitely take you up on that.

27:35.935 --> 27:37.761
You know what?
I forgot a pencil at my desk,

27:37.786 --> 27:40.261
- so I have to excuse myself.
- Just one...

27:41.126 --> 27:43.636
Uh, mind blown.

27:43.661 --> 27:44.964
So many questions.

27:44.989 --> 27:46.355
How did that happen? What?

27:46.380 --> 27:48.699
And did you really make
contact without telling me?

27:48.724 --> 27:51.722
We might have bonded on a deep,
emotional level.

27:51.747 --> 27:54.105
Zoey, got a minute?

27:54.130 --> 27:55.527
Mm-hmm.

27:58.308 --> 27:59.371
Hi, Joan.

27:59.396 --> 28:01.012
I'm going to be
uncharacteristically honest

28:01.036 --> 28:02.598
with you right now.
Don't get used to it.

28:02.622 --> 28:04.156
You're one of the best
programmers we have,

28:04.180 --> 28:06.769
which is why it's between you
and one other person for this job.

28:06.794 --> 28:09.230
- It is? That's...
- Meaningless, unless I pick you.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.021
This is a big opportunity.

28:11.046 --> 28:12.412
Why did you leave work yesterday,

28:12.437 --> 28:14.613
and why are you so
distracted all of a sudden?

28:14.638 --> 28:17.231
- You noticed that?
- I notice everything.

28:17.415 --> 28:18.818
Maybe you don't want this promotion.

28:18.842 --> 28:21.208
No. Uh, I just have a lot going on.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.044
That wasn't me looking for an answer.

28:23.069 --> 28:26.356
That was me telling you to get
back to your desk and focus.

28:26.381 --> 28:27.647
Okay.

28:28.953 --> 28:32.247
Hey. So what was that all about?

28:32.272 --> 28:33.272
Nothing. She was just...

28:33.297 --> 28:34.662
Was she giving you a clue about the bug?

28:34.686 --> 28:35.897
Does it have to do with our software

28:35.921 --> 28:37.822
or the watch's firmware?
At least tell us that much.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.740
- She didn't say anything.
- Are you sure? 'Cause it kinda

28:39.764 --> 28:42.044
seemed like she was giving
you some inside information.

28:42.069 --> 28:43.491
You know what I mean? Leaning in,

28:43.516 --> 28:45.013
breaking the glass ceiling.

28:45.038 --> 28:46.671
A woman's place is in the house...

28:46.696 --> 28:48.013
and the Senate. What up?

28:48.038 --> 28:49.459
Okay, dude, come on.
You gotta stop trying

28:49.483 --> 28:51.848
to turn this into, like,
an us-versus-her thing.

28:51.873 --> 28:53.253
Okay? We're all in this together.

28:53.278 --> 28:54.895
Fine.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.154
Look, so, Zoey, no matter what happened,

28:57.179 --> 29:00.356
whether Joan gave you some sort
of special advantage or not,

29:00.381 --> 29:01.653

30:16.681 --> 30:18.709
Glad to hear it.

30:18.711 --> 30:19.977
Yeah.

30:24.813 --> 30:26.899
Two cheesequakes, please.

30:29.507 --> 30:30.843
Thank you.

30:32.877 --> 30:34.343
Back so soon?

30:34.368 --> 30:36.352
I warned you.
Those things are addictive.

30:36.377 --> 30:39.912
Hi. I was just about to call you.

30:39.937 --> 30:41.211
Is everything okay?

30:42.186 --> 30:43.352
Not really.

30:43.377 --> 30:45.469
I was hoping I could take you up

30:45.494 --> 30:48.727
on that whole leaning
on each other thing.

30:48.752 --> 30:50.548
Is right now a bad time?

30:50.573 --> 30:53.461
Babe, there you are.

30:54.488 --> 30:55.696
I hope you're stopping him

30:55.721 --> 30:57.789
from buying any more of those things.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.736
He's so obsessed. He wants them to be

30:59.760 --> 31:01.891
one of the dessert
options at the wedding.

31:02.368 --> 31:05.391
The wedding?

31:05.416 --> 31:07.909
- This is my fiancée, Jessica.
- Hi.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.868
Uh, Zoey and I work with
each other at Sprq Point.

31:09.892 --> 31:12.633
- Oh.
- Not exactly work with each other.

31:12.658 --> 31:14.860
I'm just a coder,

31:14.885 --> 31:18.376
while your man's a big
old, fancy suit guy.

31:18.401 --> 31:20.067
We were just gonna go grab a bite.

31:20.069 --> 31:21.196
Do you want to join, or...

31:21.221 --> 31:22.653
Oh, no, no, that's okay. I can't.

31:22.678 --> 31:24.011
Maybe another time.

31:24.036 --> 31:26.103
Really nice to meet you.

31:26.128 --> 31:27.375
Have fun.

31:30.946 --> 31:32.579
She's so sweet.

31:42.186 --> 31:44.188
Hey, Dad.

31:44.213 --> 31:49.039
I'm, uh, going through a
little bit of a rough patch...

31:49.514 --> 31:52.032
and could really use your help.

31:54.072 --> 31:56.239
I'm flailing at work.

31:56.264 --> 31:58.598
I just found out a
guy I like is engaged,

31:58.623 --> 32:03.727
and I am either going totally nuts,

32:03.760 --> 32:07.491
or I suddenly can hear
people's innermost thoughts

32:07.516 --> 32:10.422
as big musical numbers.

32:12.657 --> 32:13.890
Don't ask.

32:15.791 --> 32:20.110
I just feel like everyone's against me.

32:21.258 --> 32:23.594
I'm losing my mind.

32:24.760 --> 32:30.196
And the one person who...

32:31.369 --> 32:34.798
seemed to always make me feel
better in times like this...

32:38.417 --> 32:40.712
isn't really here anymore...

32:43.524 --> 32:45.899
which is not fair.

32:48.518 --> 32:51.079
'Cause I really need you,

32:51.104 --> 32:52.868
so could you just...

32:54.134 --> 32:56.063
like, snap out of this

32:56.088 --> 33:01.087
or make it all go away or something?

33:04.396 --> 33:10.860

Dad is processing
everything we're saying!

35:47.901 --> 35:49.188
He's still with us.

35:49.501 --> 35:50.818
- How do you know?
- What are you talking about?

35:50.820 --> 35:52.702
You're gonna have to trust
me on this one, okay?

35:52.727 --> 35:55.921
And, also, we're taking him sailing.

35:55.946 --> 35:57.860
Oh, Zoey, that's sweet,

35:57.885 --> 35:59.895
but I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.140
- Yeah, why would we take Dad?
- Stop!

36:02.165 --> 36:03.965
He's always loved going outside,

36:03.990 --> 36:06.495
and this is going
to make him happy. Okay?

36:06.520 --> 36:08.121
So I'm gonna call the boat rental place,

36:08.146 --> 36:10.465
and all you have to do
is clear your Sunday,

36:10.490 --> 36:12.832
bring a warm jacket, and enjoy the day.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.586
See? That's the way to do it.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.410
- Right?
- So, I did what you said.

36:22.676 --> 36:24.262
Last night, I told Jessica everything

36:24.287 --> 36:26.544
that I've been feeling lately,
kinda let it pour out of me.

36:26.568 --> 36:28.222
How'd it go?

36:28.247 --> 36:31.097
Well, it definitely felt
good to say it out loud,

36:31.122 --> 36:33.168
and I guess maybe it
gave her more clarity

36:33.193 --> 36:35.294
on how my dad's death has
been affecting me lately,

36:35.319 --> 36:36.885
so that part was helpful.

36:38.164 --> 36:41.199
- But?
- I don't think she got it.

36:41.224 --> 36:42.707
You know?

36:42.732 --> 36:45.816
Like, she hasn't had any death,
or real tragedy in her life,

36:45.841 --> 36:49.285
so I'm not sure she
really, really relates,

36:49.859 --> 36:51.808
at least not the way you do.

36:52.486 --> 36:54.739
You gave me good advice. It's just...

36:54.764 --> 36:57.255
hard when the two sides
aren't connecting.

36:57.350 --> 36:58.647
And sometimes it feels like we're in

36:58.671 --> 37:01.905
totally separate worlds,
not communicating,

37:01.930 --> 37:03.341
not even on the same bandwidth.

37:03.366 --> 37:05.165
- It's just...
- Wait.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.513
Will you excuse me, Simon?

37:07.885 --> 37:09.286
Sure.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.411
It's not the watch or the app.

37:13.436 --> 37:15.880
It's both. That 50-over-20
number isn't a reading.

37:15.905 --> 37:17.497
It's our default value we plugged in

37:17.522 --> 37:19.091
when we were programming it.

37:19.116 --> 37:21.263
The app and the watch aren't
even talking to each other.

37:21.287 --> 37:22.623
They're not communicating.

37:22.648 --> 37:24.858
Tobin, go through the
watch's firmware repository,

37:24.883 --> 37:26.617
and revert any code you
or any of the other guys

37:26.641 --> 37:27.808
touched while looking for the bug.

37:27.832 --> 37:29.537
Uh, why should I listen to you?

37:29.562 --> 37:31.381
If the watch launches
with faulty software,

37:31.406 --> 37:33.358
it's going to reflect
badly on all of us.

37:33.383 --> 37:35.412
Leif, you and the other coders,

37:35.437 --> 37:38.311
start preparing a build to ship
and wait for my final push.

37:40.245 --> 37:43.022
Two more hours,
and I would've gotten it.

37:43.047 --> 37:44.459
Just saying.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.436
Well, Zoey, you solved the bug.

37:47.461 --> 37:48.475
I did.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.866
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

37:50.891 --> 37:53.686
Why do you think you're manager
of engineering material?

37:55.974 --> 37:58.928
Because I am the best coder here.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.592
I really want the job,

38:01.617 --> 38:05.100
and I know that I have the power

38:05.125 --> 38:08.893
and the ability to be a great leader.

38:20.495 --> 38:22.006
You really think it's okay for him

38:22.031 --> 38:24.014
to go out on the water like this?

38:24.238 --> 38:26.983
We can't keep shielding
him from the world.

38:27.008 --> 38:28.694
We should be doing the opposite.

38:28.719 --> 38:30.303
Well, I hear you. I'm just...

38:30.328 --> 38:31.639
- Mom.
- Concerned...

38:32.717 --> 38:34.623
He's happy right now.

38:35.103 --> 38:36.717
Believe me.

38:39.625 --> 38:42.662
There's gonna be good days
and bad days, remember?

38:43.655 --> 38:46.116
Let's chalk this up to
one of the good ones.

38:57.964 --> 39:01.459
Being out here, it brings back

39:01.484 --> 39:05.350
a lot of nice old family memories,
doesn't it, darling?
