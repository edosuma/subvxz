I'm not sure, really. Andrews just
rang me and told me it was ours.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.359
Hold on one second, please.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.360
Will you two please be quiet?
I'm on a work call!

02:29.400 --> 02:32.400
Yeah, sorry - Listen. Listen,
I know it's late.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.240
For me it was either this or
Time Team Revisited, so...

02:37.200 --> 02:40.200
You coming past me?

03:12.680 --> 03:14.759
Mum, it was my birthday.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.760
So, what time did it finish?
God... four, maybe five.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.839
Your neighbours must love you.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.840
They were the last to leave.
And was Alice there?

03:25.960 --> 03:28.960
Alice and I split. Oh! Right, another
one I never met.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.400
I'm not sure you would've liked her
anyway, so...

03:33.560 --> 03:36.560
It doesn't matter what I think of
her, Jase.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.360
I just want you to be happy. Yeah.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.720
You want another one? Erm...

03:45.400 --> 03:48.400
Well, go on, then. A quick one. Then
I should shift. Paul's cooking.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.680
Yeah, me too. The flat's totalled.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.160
I mean... my sister did it.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.399
When she split up with Michael.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.400
No. It's not really my thing.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.817
Well, one in four marriages last
year started online.

04:15.842 --> 04:18.389
Yeah, I'm sure.
I just don't really fancyending up

04:18.560 --> 04:22.115
standing in front of some bloke I've been
on three dates with in my bra and knickers.

04:22.217 --> 04:24.404
That bit never bothers me.

04:24.578 --> 04:27.217
What? You in your bra and knickers?

04:27.320 --> 04:29.679
Evening. Evening, sir. Which way?

04:29.680 --> 04:32.680
Just go over the bridge...
Thank you.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.439
Because... What? Because you want to
watch EastEnders,

04:59.440 --> 05:02.440
or because wanna go out, or...?

05:02.480 --> 05:05.480
Because you're feeling sick?
I'm always feeling sick, fucktard.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.320
On account of the cancer.
Do you have cancer?

05:13.960 --> 05:16.960
Just... Really, what's the point?

05:17.331 --> 05:18.495
Oh, yeah, I know.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.532
You do everything you're meant to do
and you fight with every fibre in your body

05:21.557 --> 05:24.145
and it turns out cancer
doesn't give a shit.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.137
So, by all means, have a cry...

05:27.254 --> 05:28.557
and just tell me that you're scared.

05:28.582 --> 05:31.167
And if you like you can give up in
here as well, cos that's

05:31.215 --> 05:33.933
not really gonna make a difference, but...

05:34.680 --> 05:38.531
Please, please don't stop taking the
chemo, cos in the end, that is all we've got.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.080
Never ever become a therapist.

05:45.080 --> 05:48.080
Now please, piss off
before I top myself.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.510
And according to the local council,
the river was last dredged in 1994.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.831
Right. Obviously that doesn't necessarily
mean this went in the water after then.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.580
The last dredge could've just missed it.

06:02.605 --> 06:05.535
Sorry, to me, this looks way too
preserved to have been in here

06:05.560 --> 06:08.199
for any serious length of time.
- Ordinarily I'd agree,

06:08.200 --> 06:11.552
but there are potentially a couple
of unusual factors here.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.705
Firstly, the body was in a sealed case - meaning
very little got in for quite some time, I imagine.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.935
And then secondly, if the conditions are right,
sometimes a body that's been left in water

06:20.960 --> 06:23.879
undergoes a chemical change called
saponification.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.940
Which, effectively, seals and
preserves the body.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.119
So, how old could it be?

06:32.120 --> 06:36.784
Hard to say, but easily... five, ten,
20 years? Maybe longer.

06:36.880 --> 06:42.247
Wow! Male, do you think? Cos that
looks like a bloke's watch.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.079
Let me get everything back to my lab.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.581
We'll get the remains out,
clean them up and see where we are.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.999
Yeah. Call me when you're ready.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.260
Thanks, Fran.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.200
Popular picnic spot apparently.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.960
All the people who sat here...

07:10.320 --> 07:15.515
Families, lovers, old ladies eating their egg
and cress and just a few yards away...

07:18.560 --> 07:21.560
I hate egg and cress.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.359
Do you? Mm.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.360
I don't mind it. No? What's your
sandwich of choice, then?

07:28.680 --> 07:31.680
Wouldn't be a sandwich. A crusty,
white roll, grated cheese and onion.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.280
White bread gives you cancer.
Yeah, that's what they say today.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.560
Next week... the key to everlasting
life.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.679
Hi, jason. Oh, hi, Cath.

07:54.680 --> 07:59.375
Sorry about your party. I had to work late,
and by the time we got back your lights wereout.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.837
Yeah, oh, well. Everyone was
knackered, so it wasn't a late one.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.360
Another time maybe?
- Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.960
Do you wanna fix a date now or...?

08:12.040 --> 08:15.758
Well... let me have a look at my diary and I'll
- Sure.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.880
No problem. Night, Cath.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.880
Hiya. In here.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.239
Hey, love. How'd it go?

08:53.240 --> 08:55.319
Fine.

08:55.320 --> 08:58.320
What? Oh, just...

08:58.440 --> 09:01.440
Well, they're all lovely and
everything but...

09:01.560 --> 09:05.599
They're all little, old ladies, aren't they?
- And you're an old man. Old man.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.279
Yes. Well, thanks for that.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.280
I'm gonna head up. Dad...

09:12.440 --> 09:15.439
Sorry, no, I didn't mean - No, no,
it's all right.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.519
I'm just feeling a bit bushed.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.599
I'll see you in the morning.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.600
Love you.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.600
How about I get an extra flight to
Spain?

09:32.720 --> 09:35.720
Becca wouldn't mind. He's always
great company.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.960
Paul... that is so kind of you.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.840
Oh! Come on. Hey!

09:45.120 --> 09:48.120
He'll be OK.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.440
Mm? He's a cracking lad.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.640
Someone will see that one day.
They will. Mm.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.759
Hm?

09:57.760 --> 10:00.760
Oh!

10:03.160 --> 10:06.160
On three. One, two, three.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.279
Yeah, as I suspected it is a
Blanchard.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.879
You can just see that mark on this
rim.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.519
Oh, I've never heard of it.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.799
They went out of business in the
early '905.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.800
The seals kept going, which wasn't
brilliant on a diving watch.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.920
Don't they have serial numbers
inside? Not this model, annoyingly.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.760
So, not helpful then, in terms of
dating the body.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.839
Maybe we should be concentrating on
the suitcase.

11:10.840 --> 11:15.152
Well, this is a watch, although not a premium one,
it still cost the best part of a grand.

11:15.177 --> 11:18.177
So if it goes wrong, you get it
fixed. Any watchmaker fixing a watch,

11:19.960 --> 11:22.960
will leave a little mark
on the inside plate.

11:23.480 --> 11:26.480
Now, if I can get this off we might
find the date, firstly.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.559
But more importantly, we might find a
name.

11:29.560 --> 11:35.474
So if this watch was fixed at some point... you
think we could probably identify the watchmaker?

11:35.600 --> 11:38.519
If we can identify them...

11:38.520 --> 11:41.520
They might be able to tell us whose
watch it was.

11:45.462 --> 11:45.563
♪♪

11:50.900 --> 11:57.587
In mitigation, Your Honour, I would ask you
consider the side of jordan that he hides,

11:58.422 --> 12:02.680
very successfully, from any figure of
authority he comes into contact with.

12:03.460 --> 12:06.460
And that is the side
of this young man

12:06.620 --> 12:11.108
who spent all the profits accrued
from selling the drugs he was arrested for

12:11.420 --> 12:14.420
on a week at a holiday camp for his
younger brother Liam.

12:15.260 --> 12:18.260
If I may...

12:19.860 --> 12:25.024
The younger brother, who, like jordan,
was taken into care before he turned six.

12:27.740 --> 12:32.005
The fact is, Your Honour, what jordan needs...
In fact, what he desperately wants

12:32.140 --> 12:34.979
is help with his addiction.

12:34.980 --> 12:37.980
Because jordan is, at heart,
a kind and decent young man.

12:40.980 --> 12:43.980
And Iwould ask that we help him show
the world what he is truly capable of.

12:48.140 --> 12:51.139
Laters, bruv. I sincerely hope not.

12:51.140 --> 12:53.499
Say hi to Liam for me. Will do.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.500
See ya, Col!

13:03.060 --> 13:05.139
Oh!

13:05.140 --> 13:06.671
Excuse me!

13:38.580 --> 13:41.099
Are you serious? The most important
day of our lives.

13:41.100 --> 13:44.100
Nearly gave me a bloody heart attack.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.900
Oh, what you worried about? We've
got at least 15 seconds.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.299
Oh, just hold me up for a minute.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.979
Daddies! Hey!

13:54.980 --> 13:57.059
Oh, hi!

13:57.060 --> 13:59.659
Oh, my darling girl. Shall we go
home?

13:59.660 --> 14:02.660
Yeah. You all right? You ready?
Yeah. Yeah? Good.

14:03.100 --> 14:06.100
I'll take that. You all set? Oh,
she's been so excited. Bye, janet.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.099
Bye, Flo! Bye!

14:09.100 --> 14:12.100
Bye, Flo!

14:12.860 --> 14:15.459
Pizza! Pizza? Oh, yes.

14:15.460 --> 14:18.460
And carrot sticks? No.
And some fruit.

14:50.780 --> 14:53.780
Smith? I'm afraid so. But we do have
an initial.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.339
W Smith?

14:58.340 --> 15:00.739
12/06/89. Yep.

15:00.740 --> 15:03.339
And 04/02/90.

15:03.340 --> 15:07.293
In the absence of a serial number
this is your best bet of identifying the owner.

15:08.780 --> 15:11.780
'So, I've started in
january, 1990.‘ Yeah, good.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.899
'And for now I've taken it up to
1995.‘

15:15.900 --> 15:18.900
Fair enough. 'And that brings up
only 1.5 million missing persons.‘

15:20.220 --> 15:23.099
Oh, please. Now, as we're pretty sure
it's male...

15:23.100 --> 15:26.059
that narrows it down to about
750,000.

15:26.060 --> 15:29.942
Still missing after five years -
that narrows it down to 1% of that figure.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.059
Yeah, that's still 7,500.

15:33.060 --> 15:36.019
Yeah, sorry.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.499
Yeah, hold fire on that for now.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.353
Thanks, jake. 'Cool.‘

15:40.400 --> 15:42.228
I think that's it there.

15:43.779 --> 15:48.708
Obviously there are quite a number of Smiths.
Though the initial does narrow it down quite a bit.

15:48.820 --> 15:53.241
I should also say there are many thousands of
watch repairers who don't belong to our guild,

15:53.300 --> 15:56.300
and we don't keep records of.
-  Right.

15:56.980 --> 15:59.916
But listen... Give me half an hour.
I'll see what I can do.

15:59.941 --> 16:00.979
Thank you so much.

16:01.004 --> 16:03.402
Oh, will you excuse me?

16:05.232 --> 16:08.232
Dr East, how we doing?

16:12.300 --> 16:15.300
'Come, you spirits, that tend on
mortal thoughts.

16:15.460 --> 16:21.225
Unsex me here and fill me from the
crown to the toe top, full of direst cruelty.'

16:22.380 --> 16:25.380
'Unsex me here.' So why is she
talking about sex in this scene?

16:27.940 --> 16:30.940
Why, we might suppose that she has
more important things on her mind?

16:31.660 --> 16:34.660
What's more important than sex?

16:34.700 --> 16:37.459
Why is she saying this?

16:37.460 --> 16:40.460
janice. Cos she isn't talking about
sex in that way.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.739
She means, like, gender.

16:43.740 --> 16:46.579
Very good. But women murder.

16:46.580 --> 16:49.499
They do. Like Myra Hindley.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.179
Charlize Theron.

16:52.180 --> 16:54.899
No, no, it's a good point Karim's
making.

16:54.900 --> 16:57.900
But like Aileen Wuornos, who I think
you're referring to,

16:58.300 --> 17:00.892
like almost all female killers,

17:00.933 --> 17:05.221
when women do kill, they generally kill
for a man or because of a man.

17:05.300 --> 17:09.432
What Shakespeare is saying here is
that it's not really in their nature to murder.

17:11.420 --> 17:13.240
Two sides, please, for Monday.

17:13.326 --> 17:16.287
Is Lady Macbeth more evil than her
husband?

17:17.500 --> 17:20.378
Did I say you could touch me?

17:20.380 --> 17:23.419
So there's some lamb burgers in the
freezer, and they can have them with

17:23.444 --> 17:24.974
spaghetti hoops and broccoli?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.739
Oh, I think we're covering all the
food groups there.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.939
And I should be back by nine-ish.
- CooL

17:29.940 --> 17:31.772
You nervous?
- No. Terrified.

17:31.797 --> 17:34.130
Ah, you'll be fine. How many do you
reckon they're seeing?

17:34.185 --> 17:35.715
Dunno. Loads, though.

17:35.740 --> 17:37.872
I thought you said it was in
special measures?

17:37.897 --> 17:40.632
Exactly. Who wouldn't want to turn a school
like that around?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.078
All right.
Teachers are weird.

17:42.111 --> 17:44.353
Says the man who adds up for a living.
- Yeah, all right.

17:44.393 --> 17:47.877
Piss off. Love you.
- Yeah, love youtoo. Bye.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.259
0h!

17:55.260 --> 17:58.260
Oh, why not? Well, because I thought
we agreed fresh fruit for brekkie,

17:59.220 --> 18:01.899
and cos Daddy Colin said no.
0h! Right.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.900
I knew it would end up being somehow
my fault. Please, Daddy!

18:05.820 --> 18:08.299
Please, Daddy!

18:08.300 --> 18:11.300
All right, one packet. Yes!

18:13.900 --> 18:16.900
Look! Nope. Yeah, let's not push it,
eh, Flo?

18:17.900 --> 18:20.900
Come on, yoghurt.

18:22.260 --> 18:25.260
I hope you all die of fucking AIDS.
The kid, too.

18:36.220 --> 18:39.220
So, it is a male? Height -
approximately 5'9 "-5'10".

18:40.940 --> 18:45.557
And from the extent of the saponification
I'd say he was probably a little overweight.

18:46.020 --> 18:49.643
Age wise... I'd estimate somewhere
between 30 and 50.

18:49.668 --> 18:50.684
OK.

18:52.660 --> 18:55.660
Cause of death.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.419
It was in his chest cavity.

18:59.420 --> 19:02.139
I'm guessing... a kitchen knife?

19:02.140 --> 19:06.733
The handle's maybe rotted away or
perhaps even snapped off at the time of entry.

19:06.780 --> 19:09.659
Right.

19:09.660 --> 19:16.652
So, there are blade marks on the
fourth and fifth left side ribs here.

19:17.060 --> 19:19.499
And here.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.500
All of which is consistent with a
fatal stab wound to the chest.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.099
To the heart?
- Mm-hm.

19:25.124 --> 19:26.327
Based on striations and...

19:26.553 --> 19:29.355
...the width of the blade, it would certainly
have penetrated the heart

19:29.380 --> 19:31.717
and the victim would have bled out fairly quickly.

19:31.742 --> 19:32.684
OK.

19:32.709 --> 19:35.019
So, we found nothing else in the
suitcase.

19:35.020 --> 19:37.520
But when I was examining the body I...

19:37.559 --> 19:40.395
...noticed something a bit odd about
the area directly below the wound

19:40.420 --> 19:42.779
as he was laying. I had a bit of a
dig around...

19:42.780 --> 19:45.579
...and eventually...

19:45.580 --> 19:48.580
I pulled out this.

19:48.860 --> 19:50.414
What is it?

19:50.446 --> 19:53.875
Well, the waxy material is what I told you
about, the hydrolysed body fat.

19:53.900 --> 19:54.902
Yeah.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.257
But it's what it's collected around
that's interesting.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.059
Jesus!

20:02.060 --> 20:05.060
It says 'Andersson', who were a
telecoms company.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.179
I'm guessing it was in
his shirt pocket.

20:08.180 --> 20:11.180
And I think it was
the remains of a pager.

20:15.048 --> 20:15.149
♪♪

20:20.440 --> 20:21.532
Here we go.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.642
You all right?

20:27.697 --> 20:29.962
Yeah, yeah.
- Just a bit nervous, I think.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.255
We're gonna be fine.
- Are we?

20:32.280 --> 20:35.280
100%. And in ten weeks' time she'll
be ours for good.

20:35.314 --> 20:36.329
Trust me.

20:36.353 --> 20:40.282
They're not gonna revoke the adoption
because we gave her Honey Squares.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.431
Right. Seatbelt on, please. OK. I'll
open those for you in one second.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.680
Done. OK. That's it. Done. OK.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.120
Obviously, for your sake, I would've
hoped there'd been less.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.040
Trust me... I thought it'd be worse.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.999
Email the ones that I've marked,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.919
and attach of a photo of the watch.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.879
And Oliver's photo of
the engraved signature.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.880
I'm gonna visit some of the Central
London ones in person.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.120
Got you.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.960
No, that's not me. You sure?
Absolutely positive. OK.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.640
So the email I sent you. Do you
recognise that signature?

21:51.080 --> 21:54.080
No? OK, no problem. Probably be back
in touch.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.479
Thanks for your time. Bye.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.480
Not to worry. We have your details if
anything changes. Cheers. Bye-bye.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.160
OK, thanks for your time.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.240
Hiya! In here.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.159
There you go.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.160
Hello, my darlings. We're having fish
fingers again.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.515
We've run out of quail's eggs and
lark's tongues.

22:33.540 --> 22:34.900
Oh, nothing wrong with fish fingers.

22:34.925 --> 22:38.370
A fish finger sandwich is one of the
finest inventions knownto man.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.930
Hear-hear.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.160
I thought you said five.
That's what she told me.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.279
Oh, hi, love. Hi. I thought you said five.
- No, I said four.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.530
Party starts at six.

22:52.577 --> 22:55.702
Oh, right, four. Well, it's 4:25.
- Marion, don't start.

22:55.840 --> 22:59.035
Tony's just served up, we're still eating.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Tony.

22:59.408 --> 23:00.908
Sorry, I did tell Marion four.

23:00.933 --> 23:02.590
No, she didn't.
- It's not a problem.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.687
Come on, boys, we need to get going

23:03.712 --> 23:06.434
because I want you dressed and
showered by the time everyone arrives.

23:06.482 --> 23:08.091
Want me to doggy bag it?

23:08.127 --> 23:10.540
No, I'll give them a sandwich or
something when we get home.

23:10.565 --> 23:12.055
Thank you so much.
- All right.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.572
I'll see you later.
- Bye.

23:13.597 --> 23:15.855
And don't be late.
Bye, boys, we'll see you later.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.442
Bye, Aunty Marion.
- You got everything?

23:17.482 --> 23:18.495
Yes, thank you.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.255
I go on first.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.680
Hey, come on, then. Off we go.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.880
jump in the back. Bye! Bye!

23:27.120 --> 23:28.266
Ah!

23:41.880 --> 23:44.519
How does she manage to be such an
annoying bitch?

23:44.520 --> 23:47.520
I do not know.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.560
What's that? What?

23:51.200 --> 23:54.200
Right, that was evil.
It's all going in.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.760
No...

23:58.040 --> 24:00.479
3CX, and that's it.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.480
OK. So try Andersson first.
See if they can help.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.640
OK, thanks, Fran.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.040
Hi. I'm looking for Nathan.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.599
Yep, that's me.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.239
Right. Blimey.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.240
Last time I saw you, you just weed
your pants all over my sofa.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.760
I'm Adam Stuart's mum.
Ah, hi, Mrs Stuart.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.950
Yeah, he said you might pop in.

24:37.981 --> 24:41.316
I mean, you were only nine, so... you
know, I've moved on.

24:41.598 --> 24:44.720
He said you had a pager that you
wanted me to look at.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.039
And this was released in...? 1989.

25:14.040 --> 25:17.040
And did this have a... what?
I dunno, SIM or...?

25:18.600 --> 25:23.889
This is a pager. SIMs are only in phones,
and only 2G, which wasn't launched till '91.

25:23.920 --> 25:28.146
OK, so how was information stored on it?
It's a basic data chip built into the pager itself.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.759
And these chips held how much data?

25:30.760 --> 25:34.035
Very little. Maybe last 20 messages.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.867
Which was just... Were they just numbers or...?
Oh, no, it's alphanumeric.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.679
So it could receive messages
29 characters long.

25:40.680 --> 25:44.984
OK. So given what I've told you, and
where it's been for the last...

25:45.040 --> 25:47.055
I dunno, however many years...

25:47.095 --> 25:50.305
What do you think the chances are that we
could pull any data off it?

25:50.330 --> 25:52.840
What we'd need to do is source a
working version of this model.

25:52.865 --> 25:54.375
How do we do that?
- eBay.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.159
Yeah, and then we de-solder the data
chip from this,

25:57.160 --> 26:00.565
solder it into the working version
and see what we get.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.989
But it's possible?

26:03.021 --> 26:06.419
It's a microchip made of silicon.
Anything's possible.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.960
Good to see you, mate. Give my best
to Emma. We'll be in touch very soon.

26:21.257 --> 26:24.014
Mrs Mahmoud, so sorry to keep you
waiting. Would you like to come in?

26:24.077 --> 26:25.132
Yes.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.840
Hi. Hi.

26:36.480 --> 26:39.480

26:53.480 --> 26:56.480
All right, here we go. Wish me luck!

26:57.800 --> 27:00.800
Ooh! Come on. Oh, come on, Mum, you
can do better than that.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.919
Come on!

27:03.920 --> 27:06.920
Loads of puff.

27:07.440 --> 27:10.440
Hooray! What?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.400
No, you're right. It would be a big
leap for me, heading up a school.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.440
But I've headed up a Sixth Form for
five years now

27:23.840 --> 27:26.759
and so...

27:26.760 --> 27:29.760
..I'm confident that I could
successfully make the leap.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.920
Sorry, said 'leap' twice.

27:36.360 --> 27:39.360
With the right support, and Iwould
relish the opportunity.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.480
So...

27:45.920 --> 27:48.920
Yeah.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.399
Sorry! Hi, there.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.400
Hi. Ijust...

28:12.120 --> 28:15.120
I wanted to say...

28:17.920 --> 28:20.920
I wanted to say there are gonna be
better qualified candidates than me.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.400
Better managers, more eloquent
speakers, definitely.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.799
But I promise you this...

28:30.800 --> 28:32.167
You will never,

28:32.198 --> 28:35.855
never find a candidate who understands the
sorts of kids you have at Highbrook

28:35.880 --> 28:37.106
better than me.

28:37.794 --> 28:43.169
A woman who left school at 16, who didn't get
a single qualification till she was 25.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.959
Who knows what it feels like to be written off.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.207
What it does to you inside.

28:48.320 --> 28:54.577
Which is why I've never written any kid off,
no matter how challenging in my entire career.

28:55.560 --> 28:59.895
And why, if I got this job,
I would fight with my dying breath

28:59.920 --> 29:03.966
to make Highbrook the school that
every single kid who comes here deserves.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.599
And I'd be cheaper, too.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.600
Hmm... Thanks for your time.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Have a good evening.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.875
Oh, I blew a few candles out. Get a
life, Elise. Come on!

29:24.916 --> 29:27.853
Which I asked you not to do because
she said she wanted to do it herself.

29:27.878 --> 29:29.730
I can't believe you're making a fuss
about this!

29:29.762 --> 29:32.598
I just wanted her to be
centre of attention for once!

29:32.640 --> 29:35.159
Says the woman who insisted on having
the party here.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.683
We could hardly have got 50 people
into your house, could we?

29:37.715 --> 29:39.575
She didn't even want 50 people, Elise.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.695
Please, do not even try and tell me
what Mum wants.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.845
You don't even begin to understand
what she wants.

29:44.892 --> 29:47.023
And you do because
you're the golden child.

29:47.048 --> 29:49.479
No, I am not the golden child,
Marion.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.480
I just didn't piss off for the best
part of a decade.- Oh, here we go!

29:52.560 --> 29:55.917
So the relationship I have with her,
I have earned.- Anyone want a top-up?

29:55.942 --> 29:57.879
No, we're leaving.
- What?

29:57.880 --> 30:00.544
I'm sure it's what we both want
anyway.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.385
What the hell happened?

30:04.440 --> 30:08.314
I'm so sorry, Tony.
- You always get caught in the bloody crossfire.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.736
All right. Well, say sorry to joy
for me. I will.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.700
See ya.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.699
Marion?

30:18.840 --> 30:21.840
Marion! Marion, slow down!

30:22.120 --> 30:25.120
If you defend her... If you say one
bloody word, I swear...

30:25.880 --> 30:28.880
Look, you didn't even say
goodbye to - Oh!

30:29.560 --> 30:32.560
Marion!

30:48.640 --> 30:52.085
Hey, what is going on here? Having
fun at this time of night?

30:52.440 --> 30:55.440
Come on. It's bed. Come on. Let's go
on up.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.720
I'll take her. Come on.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.920
Good night. Say night night.
Love you. Love you.

31:03.280 --> 31:07.048
Right, Monkey. I'll race you.
Come on. Go, go, go!

31:07.960 --> 31:10.919
What if something goes wrong?
But what if it doesn't?

31:10.920 --> 31:13.920
But what if it does?
But what if it doesn't?

31:15.760 --> 31:18.760
Come on, you scooch down.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.400
You're safe now, Flo. Safe with us.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.239
OK? No-one's ever gonna take you
away.

31:27.240 --> 31:30.240
OK? OK.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.480
Love you, sweetheart. Love you, too.
Good night, Daddy.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.719
See you in the morning.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.720
Night night.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.720
She's asleep. She's down? Mm-hm.
Well done.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.320
Excuse me! Excuse me, sir!

32:14.320 --> 32:17.320
I think that could be
my uncle's signature.

32:18.727 --> 32:18.828
♪♪

32:22.404 --> 32:25.490
She was drunk, that it was a ten-second
snog and that it didn't mean anything.

32:25.522 --> 32:26.529
Oh!

32:27.040 --> 32:29.399
Yeah, well, far be it from me to
pass judgment.

32:29.438 --> 32:31.396
Here we go.
- She's clearly a cow.

32:31.421 --> 32:34.741
I mean, you don't go getting off with
your boyfriend's best mate, do you?

32:34.840 --> 32:38.249
It's like some weird porno scenario.

32:38.360 --> 32:41.360
How would you know?
- It's just not normal, is it?

32:42.680 --> 32:45.680
Oh, sorry, I've got to take this.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.920
Sunny? Hey, I think we may have found
our watchmaker.

32:50.040 --> 32:53.040
Are you serious? Yes, I spoke to a
Patrick Smith earlier. Shh!

32:56.000 --> 33:00.617
Spoke to a Patrick Smith earlier. He
thinks that the signature is his Uncle Bill's.

33:00.800 --> 33:04.018
He used to run the business, and
he's gonna check I'll speak to him in the morning.

33:04.097 --> 33:05.808
OK. Sounds good.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.784
How's it going with the pager?

33:08.960 --> 33:11.960
Yeah, we found a second-hand one
on eBay, so...

33:12.080 --> 33:14.399
We'll know one way or the other
tomorrow.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.400
OK. Well, progress. Yep. I'll see
you tomorrow.

33:18.360 --> 33:21.360
Yeah.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.280
Girls!

33:30.760 --> 33:33.760
Evening. Oh, hi, love. How'd it go?

33:34.400 --> 33:36.479
God, no idea.

There's at least ten people going for
it, though.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.199
Yeah? Yeah.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.479
And the actual interview was a bit
of a disaster.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.480
Sorry, no offence, Mum, but jesse
might be about to kill Gale. No!

33:48.480 --> 33:51.480
No way would jesse kill Gale.
Not a chance.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.800
Bye, sweetheart. Bye, Daddy,
I love you. Love you, too.

34:10.040 --> 34:13.040
Be good!

34:23.159 --> 34:25.239
Colin?

34:25.239 --> 34:27.319
Hi. How you doing?

34:27.320 --> 34:30.320
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. How are you?
You don't remember my name, do you?

34:31.639 --> 34:34.639
Erm... No worries. I'm Tyler.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.239
Tyler? Well, of course. You're
Milly's dad, is that right?

34:40.239 --> 34:42.359
No, no, no. I'm not a parent here.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.359
Well, not technically anyway.
I'm a stepfather.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.839
All right. Who to?

34:47.840 --> 34:50.840
Flo. I'm her birth mum's partner.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.319
What? What the hell? It's OK.
Look, Ijust wanna talk.

34:55.320 --> 34:59.124
About what? You shouldn't be making
contact with me. Colin, it's... No, no, no.

34:59.600 --> 35:03.076
How the hell did you find out where...?
It doesn't matter, I can't talk.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.951
Of course you can.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.204
I saw you yesterday,
in the supermarket.

35:10.457 --> 35:11.503
Have you followed us?

35:11.528 --> 35:14.855
I can guess what he said to you, that bloke,
so I don't blame you for what you did.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.278
It would've made me pretty angry, too.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.839
But I guess others might not be so
sympathetic.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.840
What, with you being a lawyer
and everything.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.840
What do you want?
Like I said, just to talk.

35:35.240 --> 35:38.240
With the greatest respect, 25 years
of this mob is enough for anyone.

35:38.360 --> 35:41.360
Well, I hope that it goes without
saying that you'll be very sorely missed.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.760
No, in all seriousness, I've loved
every single minute of it.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.839
Well, you were always a natural,
Tess.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.840
I suspect it's gonna be early next
year. Probably April.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.639
just let me know as soon as you
decide.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.640
We'll start organising a party.
Absolutely.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.520
What are we going to do without you,
Tess? Ah!

36:05.480 --> 36:08.480
All right, T.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.079
The wonders of eBay. Hmm.

36:13.080 --> 36:15.919
So, pleased be prepared for this not
to work at all.

36:15.920 --> 36:20.043
The data chip could be damaged as I remove it.
It could be damaged as I put it in the new pager.

36:20.068 --> 36:22.037
It's OK. I get it.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.080
I'll call you.
- Or I can wait.

36:26.240 --> 36:29.458
I'll call you.
- OK.

36:36.080 --> 36:39.080
I don't wanna be here. You know,
I have pride like you.

36:39.360 --> 36:42.239
And I love Flo.
You know, we both did.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.839
Do.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.439
But if you knew the childhood
Sal had had...

36:47.440 --> 36:50.319
Cos she was never taught how you do
it, you see - be a good mum.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.320
How much do you want? She's been
clean for three months now, Col.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.799
Colin. Which is the longest time
ever.

36:56.034 --> 36:59.425
Which makes it even harder knowing
Flo's in the same city just a few miles away,

36:59.480 --> 37:01.846
being brought up by someone else.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.999
And she absolutely knows
it's the best for Flo.

37:05.024 --> 37:07.016
How much?

37:08.040 --> 37:09.836
£5,000.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.875
just to move. Money for a van and a
deposit on a flat.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.275
We've seen a place in Hastings.

37:17.320 --> 37:21.179
We're not bad people, Colin. We just
want the same as you - the best for Flo.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.959
I need to think.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.960
Give me your number, I'll call you.

38:19.320 --> 38:24.679
Yeah, but just remember, Zoe, as hard as this is for
you, I actually sometimes think it's harder for them.

38:25.463 --> 38:28.935
I can't imagine anything worse than
being a parent and seeing your child in pain,

38:28.960 --> 38:31.009
and not being able to do anything about it.

38:31.049 --> 38:34.619
So maybe you just need to
cut them a little slack sometimes.

38:35.368 --> 38:38.368
You know, cos they're under immense
pressure, too, aren't they?

38:39.088 --> 38:40.588
Yeah.

38:41.160 --> 38:44.588
OK. Listen, I've gotta go but I'll
see you on the ward on Friday, OK?

38:44.640 --> 38:47.359
Bye. All right, bye, love.

38:47.360 --> 38:50.039
Hiya! Who was that?

38:50.040 --> 38:52.959
Oh, it was Zoe, the girl with
Non-Hodgkin's.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.960
Oh, right. She's got your personal
number?

38:56.400 --> 38:58.479
How was your morning?

38:58.504 --> 39:01.105
Yeah, great. I got the sash windows

39:01.144 --> 39:03.277
Great. Listen, I gotta shift cos
I'm on at two.

39:03.360 --> 39:06.360
Marion?
- Yeah?

39:06.440 --> 39:09.440
Er... do you wanna talk about last
night?

39:09.640 --> 39:11.719
I'm really late, love.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.720
See ya.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.799
Here we go.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.800
Three months either side of
when the repairs were done.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.560
Ah, brilliant. Thank you. Good luck.

39:33.600 --> 39:38.455
So, I got Patrick Smith to dig out the business
account statements for three months either side

39:38.480 --> 39:40.639
of the dates the repairs were done.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.944
I thought that if I could find payments that
were made on or around the repair dates

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
that were made by the same person...
Chances are that could be our man.

39:49.560 --> 39:52.239
So I did.

39:52.240 --> 39:55.240
First one's here...

39:55.800 --> 39:58.800
Was made on 21st of june, 1989 -

40:01.240 --> 40:04.079
a week or so after the first repair.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.080
Credit card payment made by
Mr D Walker.

40:07.640 --> 40:10.640
And the second one... made on
February the 14th, 1990 -

40:11.960 --> 40:14.960
about ten days after the repair.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.120
Payment made by Mr D Walker. Genius.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.080
Then I checked Missing Persons...

40:23.680 --> 40:26.680
And... here he is...

40:27.240 --> 40:30.240
Mr D Walker.

40:43.120 --> 40:46.120
'David Ewan Walker.

40:47.640 --> 40:50.199
39 years old.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.200
Last seen on the 8th of May, 1990.

40:55.680 --> 40:58.680
5'9" tall, blue eyes, brown hair.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.840
Last seen in the Cricketers Public
House, Cannon Street, London.

41:04.480 --> 41:08.815
If you have any information on David's whereabouts,
please call Winston Hill Police Station

41:08.840 --> 41:11.840
and help reunite David with his
wife...

41:14.360 --> 41:17.360
..and five-year-old son...

41:18.520 --> 41:21.520
..who desperately wants his daddy to
come home.'

41:57.440 --> 42:00.319
Hello. Hello. We're looking for
Tessa Walker.

42:00.320 --> 42:03.320
I'm DCI Cassie Stuart.
This is DI Sunil Khan.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.759
I'm Tessa Nixon. I haven't been
Walker for eight years.

42:07.760 --> 42:10.760
Right. Can we come in, Mrs Nixon?

42:11.800 --> 42:14.800
Why? Can we?

42:17.080 --> 42:20.080
Is this...?

42:21.400 --> 42:23.999
Is this David?

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
Yes, we think so.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.840
Where did you find him? His remains
were found in a river.

42:32.440 --> 42:35.440
In a river? The Lea.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.479
So, when do you think he died?

42:38.480 --> 42:41.480
Probably not long after he went
missing.

42:43.240 --> 42:46.240
How on earth does a body survive
26 years in a river?

42:48.640 --> 42:51.640
I'm a copper myself. I've seen what
water does to a body.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.880
How... how do you even start to
identify remains from that long ago?

42:57.600 --> 43:00.600
His remains were found in a
suitcase.

43:03.960 --> 43:06.960
I assumed... that it was suicide.
Wasn't it?

43:09.360 --> 43:12.360
We've found pretty good evidence to
suggest that David was murdered.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.800
0h!

43:18.440 --> 43:21.440
I'm so sorry.

43:23.200 --> 43:26.200
That was your husband, Mrs Nixon.
He's on his way now.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.720
So, what are the next steps? Well,
we'll need a DNA swab from your son,

44:10.320 --> 44:12.679
if that's OK to confirm
that it is David.

44:12.680 --> 44:15.680
And obviously we'll be accessing the
original files into his disappearance.

44:18.080 --> 44:21.080
But in light of these new
developments,

44:21.400 --> 44:24.199
when would it be convenient for us
to talk further with you?

44:24.200 --> 44:27.200
We could do it here.
Or at our station.

44:30.480 --> 44:33.480
What about tomorrow, after lunch
maybe? Yeah. Fine.

44:34.720 --> 44:37.720
Thank you.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.800
Once again... I am so sorry
for your loss.

44:42.920 --> 44:45.920
63% of all murder victims are killed
by their partners.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.639
You'll be thinking that, won't you?

44:49.640 --> 44:52.519
I would be.

44:52.520 --> 44:55.520
We'll see you tomorrow, Tessa. Yeah.

45:01.520 --> 45:04.520
Well, she looked how you'd expect,
didn't she?

45:05.480 --> 45:08.480
Shocked. Upset.

45:09.400 --> 45:12.400
But... But she'd know how to fake it
better than most.

45:18.280 --> 45:21.199
Oh! Nathan.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.119
We have some code. It's binary.

45:24.120 --> 45:27.120
Right. And that's good?
I need to do some work on it.

45:28.040 --> 45:31.040
But right now, we have a date -
15th of February, 1990.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.720
And we have words, with lots more to
come, I reckon.

45:37.080 --> 45:40.080
Thank you, Nathan. Night.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.760
And so it begins.
