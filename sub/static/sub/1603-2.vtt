<i> Previously on</i> Empire...
LUCIOUS: <i> Empire Entertainment</i>

00:03.804 --> 00:06.171
has filed to become
a publicly traded company.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.340
Don't forget
to thank your Cookie on this

00:08.342 --> 00:10.109
historic occasion.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.511
<i> You forgot about me the second</i>
<i> you divorced me in there.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:15.314
<i> It was my $400,000</i>
<i> that started this bitch.</i>

00:15.316 --> 00:17.349
And I want half my company back.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.984
I want to know everything
she's doing.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.486
<i> Everything.</i>

00:20.488 --> 00:21.854
DR. SHAHANI:
<i> You got ALS.</i>

00:21.856 --> 00:23.389
How long I got?
Three years.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.190
Part of us going public means

00:25.192 --> 00:28.193
I need one of my sons
to man up and lead it.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.728
We're all in competition to be
the future head of the company?

00:29.730 --> 00:30.796
Everything I did

00:30.798 --> 00:32.164
was for you and your brothers.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.198
Do you want a medal, bitch?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.401
What I want is some respect!

00:36.336 --> 00:38.003
<i> You got it, Mal.</i>

00:38.005 --> 00:39.038
Now we just got
to show the world.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.072
LUCIOUS:
<i> Your sexuality--</i>

00:40.074 --> 00:41.640
that's a choice, son.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.975
Hey, Mama.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.643
You really made something
of yourself.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.414
JAMAL:<i> She's trying</i> <i> to manage my career.
</i> HAKEEM:<i> If you do end up</i>

00:48.416 --> 00:50.049
<i> working with her</i>
<i> and Pop's handling me,</i>

00:50.051 --> 00:52.484
best believe they try
to make us kill each other.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.253
You can fool this country,
but I know you ain't nothing

00:54.255 --> 00:55.821
but a punk-ass gangsta.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.557
I never let anything come

00:58.559 --> 00:59.525

Thank you.

Hakeem performing

Put Jamal
up there, too.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.767
No. It's only gonna be Hakeem.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.902
Don't do this, Lucious.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.705
Jamal doesn't belong
on my stage.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.141
It's not his audience.
His audience?

04:36.143 --> 04:38.977
Jamal's music is universal,
and you know it.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.812
I've invested a whole lot
of money into Laviticus.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.748
I'm not gonna have it branded
a homosexual club.

ANIKA: Cookie, you can talk
as much mess as you want,

04:45.386 --> 04:47.786
but I have nine
of Empire's top acts

04:47.788 --> 04:50.889
and none of them
are gonna be there, so...

04:50.891 --> 04:52.391
tonight is not
about Jamal.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.327
Excuse me, sweetie,
this is a family matter

04:55.329 --> 04:58.930
involving two of my sons
and the family business

04:58.932 --> 05:01.933
that Lucious and I started
with my $400,000.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.969
Excuse me, baby.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.072
Yeah. With my money. Cookie, let
me talk to you for a second.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.074
Get your hands off of me!
I'm not that tired heifer.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.510
You signed a nondisclosure
agreement not to say

05:11.512 --> 05:12.844

the $400,000,

05:12.846 --> 05:14.613

forgotten already?

05:14.615 --> 05:17.282
She don't know that it was
my $400,000 in drug money

05:17.284 --> 05:19.685
that started this company,
does she?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.654
I went away
for a long time

05:22.656 --> 05:25.657
for you to build all of this.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.460

08:31.678 --> 08:32.677

08:32.679 --> 08:34.112
I know. So I did.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.514

outside of Palm Springs.

that I really

08:39.486 --> 08:40.986
need your attention for.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.721
Well, I've got one problem
right now,

08:42.723 --> 08:45.023
and that's finding someone
to back up my son.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.492
Get Vernon on the line.
I need him to get this done.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.294

08:49.296 --> 08:50.996

to back up Hakeem.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.703
Somebody really big.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.639
I got one shot
to debut this boy,

09:00.641 --> 09:02.140

09:02.142 --> 09:03.842

how about Kidd Fo-Fo?

09:03.844 --> 09:06.177

09:06.179 --> 09:08.179
Nah, he would never do it.
He's way too big.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.749
Oh, yes, he will. He's about
to owe us a huge favor.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.218
What you talking 'bout, Willis? There
was a shooting at a mall in Elmhurst.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.820
Two people are dead. Becky,
why didn't you tell me this?

09:15.822 --> 09:18.757
You see, you never listen to me.
I tried to tell you that before.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.726
And the idiot goes and posts
a video online and cites

09:21.728 --> 09:24.195
Fo-Fo as his biggest
inspiration.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.830
The media's been attacking us
all morning.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.499
(reporters clamoring)

09:27.501 --> 09:29.601
Mr. Lyon, do you have any
comment about the shooting?

09:29.603 --> 09:32.170
Mr. Lyon, do you have
any comment about the shooting?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.738
I have nothing.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.373
Original share price set at $18.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.576
Need to explain
valuation model to Dad.

09:37.578 --> 09:40.779
Find streaming model to increase
Empire's bottom line.

09:40.781 --> 09:44.749
Figure out how to undermine
Hakeem at Laviticus.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.452
Did you see Dr. Obst yesterday?

09:47.454 --> 09:49.287
Canceled
my last two appointments.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.257
With Laviticus opening
and this IPO, Dad freaks out

09:52.259 --> 09:53.858
every time I leave the office.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.227
You need to go.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.796
Today.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.864
You were talking
in your sleep about yourself

09:59.866 --> 10:01.132
in the third person.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.369
You need to recalibrate
your meds again.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.304
Right after Laviticus, Rhonda.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.573
Dad's using it to launch Hakeem.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.874
He's completely crazy

10:09.876 --> 10:11.876
about it right now.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.651
(moans softly)

10:21.654 --> 10:24.489
Listen to me.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.325
For most people,
canceling a doctor's appointment

10:27.327 --> 10:29.427
is just lazy.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.663
But for someone who's bipolar,

10:31.665 --> 10:34.332
it's life-threatening.

10:35.901 --> 10:38.737
And...

10:38.739 --> 10:40.772
your life...

10:40.774 --> 10:43.375
is mine.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.413
(zipper unzips)
I'll go.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.448
Oh. You should tell your mother

10:50.450 --> 10:53.184
that Hakeem is performing
at Laviticus.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.953
She'll try to sabotage it.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.455
Already did.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.291
(chuckling)

11:00.293 --> 11:03.662
(kissing)

11:07.767 --> 11:10.035
Your mom's here.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.604
Come on, boy, get up,
we got work to do.

11:12.606 --> 11:15.473
Ma, how'd you get in my house?
I got a key.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.875
What is this
song you wrote?

11:16.877 --> 11:19.277
It ain't half bad.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.945
Perform it
at the club on Saturday.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.681
You got a call
from somebody named Carter.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.883
Thought I told you
to wait in the car.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.851
Who's that?
Porsha.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.453
My new assistant.
Probationary.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.455
You want to call her?
She said it's urgent.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.023
I said get out of here.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.298
Hey. I got a plan.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.167
Your daddy's
got Hakeem performing

11:42.169 --> 11:43.535
at Laviticus on Saturday.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.870
I'm gonna get you up
on the stage, too.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.239
He don't want me there.
I don't care what he wants.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.041
Well, we do.
Shut up, Dora.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.310
You gonna get up,

11:52.312 --> 11:54.212
and you gonna
work on this song.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.514
And come Saturday,
you gonna show everybody

11:56.516 --> 11:57.916
that you are just as talented

11:57.918 --> 11:59.551
as your brother.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.585
Let's hit it.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.821
(toilet flushing)

12:05.858 --> 12:08.059
(water running)

12:26.612 --> 12:27.579
(door opens)

12:27.581 --> 12:29.414
Becky, how...
Ow.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.217
...many times do I have to
tell you about Stop-Stop it.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.952
using my bathroom?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.787
Stop it.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.689
I know you're sick.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.793
Is that why you're doing
this crazy IPO thing?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.361
Is that why you're
pitting your sons

12:43.363 --> 12:44.963
against one another
for your company?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.965
You went through my stuff?

12:53.072 --> 12:56.307
Look, I wanted
to tell you, but...

12:56.309 --> 12:58.643
Nobody can know about this.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.748
There's no cure, is there?

13:03.750 --> 13:06.151
Lou Gehrig's disease.
Or ALS.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.653
There's no cure. I'm dying.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.733
What this man is doing is wrong.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.269
(protestors shouting)

13:24.271 --> 13:26.738
Get out of my way.
Get out of our way. Move!

13:26.740 --> 13:28.940
Get out of our way! Move!

13:28.942 --> 13:30.508
Why should I apologize?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.277
No, we don't... we don't
want you to apologize,

13:32.279 --> 13:33.812
Fo-Fo. We don't want
you to say anything.

13:33.814 --> 13:36.080
I mean, look,
all the news

13:36.082 --> 13:37.582
say I inspired him, right?

13:37.584 --> 13:40.118
I'm inspiring.
I inspire people,

13:40.120 --> 13:41.286
like Gandhi.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.587
LUCIOUS:
Yeah, yeah,

13:42.589 --> 13:44.923
like Gandhi.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.759
Look, I'm getting
a whole lot of pressure

13:47.761 --> 13:50.762
to drop you.

13:50.764 --> 13:53.198
Now, I'm gonna take care
of this thing for you, but

13:53.200 --> 13:55.433
I'm gonna need you to take care
of something for me.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.768
What?

13:56.770 --> 13:58.102
Play with Hakeem

13:58.104 --> 13:59.804
at Laviticus's opening.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.973
Play backup to your son?
No, no, no, no.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.542
It's not you doing backup;
you're-you're...

14:04.544 --> 14:06.878
you're more like
a mentor to him.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.114
Like Diana Ross did
for The Jackson 5.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.850
Who's Diana Ross?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.955
You don't need to drop him
'cause of the shooting.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.523
Drop him because
his music sucks.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.158
Who is this stupid bitch?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.861
Someone who would've never
gave birth to your ugly ass.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.463
Oh, hell no! Yo, yo!
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

14:25.465 --> 14:26.798
hey, hey. What, you
gonna Ray Rice me?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.633
Yeah.
No, let him go, Vernon.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.502
I faced bigger in prison
with more talent, bitch.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.672
Yeah, a'ight, bitch.
Get your hands off of me.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.875
He's a punk. Drop him.
I'm not dropping him.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.576
He makes me a whole
lot of money.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.645
I'm not dropping him because
of no damn controversy.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.580
(scoffing)

14:42.582 --> 14:45.416
He must be on
Anika's roster.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.919
Yeah, I see you still letting
that thing think for you.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.555
No, I'm-I'm trying to think
like a businessman.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.824
You need to start acting
like a professional

14:52.826 --> 14:54.592
instead of a hood rat.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.729
Oh. Okay.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.597
Well, my professional opinion

14:59.599 --> 15:01.666
is that you should launch
'em both at the same time

15:01.668 --> 15:04.335
at Laviticus.
The press will eat it up.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.271
The-the-the crowd would love
to see two brothers

15:06.273 --> 15:08.606
onstage at the same time.
No.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.842
And stop barging in my office.

15:10.844 --> 15:12.443
You're not wanted here.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.419
I'm-a call you back.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.963
Porsha, get my damn shoe.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.732
Porsha,
get my shoe!

15:34.734 --> 15:37.001
I'm coming!

15:38.904 --> 15:39.938
(phone ringing)

15:39.940 --> 15:41.239
Hello?

15:41.241 --> 15:42.774
Mr. Vernon Turner,
Detective Walker,

15:42.776 --> 15:45.443
Manhattan North 28th Precinct.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.613
We need you to identify a body.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.116
WALKER: <i> They found him floating
in the Hudson at 96th Street.</i>

15:53.152 --> 15:55.653
<i> 2:30 this morning.</i>

16:12.771 --> 16:15.173
They shot him in the face.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.075
LUCIOUS:
It was Shyne, wasn't it, man?

16:17.077 --> 16:20.979
Yeah, but why would
anybody shoot him for $25,000?

16:22.448 --> 16:25.016
I never let anything
come between friendship.

16:28.253 --> 16:29.754
We got to let his family know.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.189
Got to tell Cookie.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.025
Nah, that was her
closest cousin, man.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.159
You want me to tell her?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.427
No, no, no, I-I got to do it.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.663
Look, call everybody

16:38.665 --> 16:41.666
and have them meet me
at my house tonight.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.901
I'm-a see you there, dude.

16:46.105 --> 16:51.009
JAMAL:
♪<i> Tell the truth</i> ♪

16:52.845 --> 16:58.383
♪ Tell the truth... ♪

16:58.385 --> 16:59.884
It needs work, but it's
something like that.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.152
I love it, honey.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.521
Dad won't even listen to it.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.524
That's why we got to
figure out a way

17:06.526 --> 17:08.893
to steal focus from Hakeem.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.696
That's cold-blooded.
Hakeem's your own son.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.498
Jamal should come out
as a big queen

17:13.500 --> 17:15.299
the same day Hakeem playing,
and that'd steal

17:15.301 --> 17:17.035
his whole thunder, for sure.
(giggles)

17:17.037 --> 17:19.971
That's exactly what we'll do.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.572
You gonna listen
to this imbecile?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.041
Yes.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.909
And you're gonna sing
your little ass off

17:24.911 --> 17:26.577
and you're gonna
steal that show from Hakeem.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.413
I don't care to
steal the show

17:28.415 --> 17:30.915
from Hakeem. And Dad ain't
gonna let me on that stage.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.650
Fo-Fo is backing Hakeem.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.919
Okay.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.388
We'll stage our own show.
(short chuckle)

17:37.390 --> 17:40.091
Right on the steps where
they're doing that protest.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.760
They can get all those reporters
to show up because some moms

17:42.762 --> 17:44.896
are mad at Kidd Fo-Fo,
they will certainly

17:44.898 --> 17:46.431
show up for your
little coming-out party.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.232
And you'll sing that song,

17:48.234 --> 17:51.836
and it'll be all over the news,
and you'll be a star.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.939
Can you stop with
the publicity stunts, Mama Rose?

17:54.941 --> 17:56.607
I'm-a come out
the way I want to.

17:56.609 --> 18:00.044
It's gonna be bomb, Jamal.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.281
Who's Mama Rose? Oh, I know who she is.
That's that lady...

18:03.283 --> 18:05.783
Hey, can you shut up and get out
of here? Give us a minute. Go.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.086
(under her breath):
Drug dealing...

18:08.088 --> 18:09.620
(Porsha muttering)
Uh, what'd you say?

18:09.622 --> 18:12.590
I didn't say nothing.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.092
(door opens, closes)

18:14.094 --> 18:16.060
Trust me, Jamal,
I know what I'm doing.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.196
I need to write songs.
I need to be creative.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.932
I don't want to get in the middle
of you and him. (phone rings)

18:20.934 --> 18:22.600
Speaking of the devil.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.104
Lucious, why? You got Kidd Fo-Fo
playing with Hakeem

18:26.106 --> 18:27.972
after you told me no to Jamal.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.874
Bunkie's dead.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.320
(quietly crying)

18:42.322 --> 18:44.355
They don't have any leads.

18:45.657 --> 18:47.325
But I'm gonna find the person

18:47.327 --> 18:48.826
that did this to my friend.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.628
And when I do, I'm gonna tear...

18:50.630 --> 18:53.164
Don't do anything
silly, Dad.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.574
They gonna be found.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.815
Bunkie wouldn't hurt nobody.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.750
I understand, baby.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.253
He was like
a father to you.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.821
Come here...

19:16.823 --> 19:19.123
(sniffling)
Come here.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.591
Don't touch me!

19:20.593 --> 19:23.194
Don't you ever touch me again!
Hakeem...

19:24.696 --> 19:27.565
VERNON: Don't disrespect
your mother like that.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.870
Hakeem... Make sure
he's  all right.

19:36.308 --> 19:40.344
VERNON: Don't you worry, Andre.
We're gonna find him.

19:44.783 --> 19:48.152
How does she know he was
like a father to us?

19:48.154 --> 19:49.887
They're cousins, stupid.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.323
And?
And Cookie knows everything.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.858
No, she don't.
Yes, she do.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.927
No, she don't.
Yes, she do.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.330
Yo, she wants me
to come out the same day

19:59.332 --> 20:01.465
that you perform at Laviticus
and get your press.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.735
She's Satan's daughter.
Why's she even here?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.504
Ain't she supposed to be locked
up for like ten more years?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.539
Hakeem, she ain't that bad.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.641
Man, I don't even feel like
performing at this show.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.212
You know Tiana?

20:17.683 --> 20:20.384
What'd you do, fool?
(burbling)

20:20.386 --> 20:22.587
Come on, what'd I tell you
about this damn reefer?

20:22.589 --> 20:25.389
(coughs)

20:25.391 --> 20:28.693
Police gave me
Bunkie's personal effects.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.262
There wasn't much left, but...

20:31.264 --> 20:33.598
think he'd want you
to have this.

20:38.337 --> 20:42.006
The last time I'm gonna
tell you about this.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.208
Why does Lil Wayne
look like the devil?

20:44.210 --> 20:46.210
Hello, Becky.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.845
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Andre, how you holding up?

20:47.847 --> 20:50.615
Not great, Dad.
Got a new problem.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.384
What is it now? Underwriting bank
for the IPO launch pulled out.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.020
I think the Kidd Fo-Fo
controversy spooked them.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.556
I don't get it.
I mean, controversy is hip-hop.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.125
That's how we get rich.
Corporate America

21:01.127 --> 21:03.127
may not be ready
for hip-hop, Dad.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.563
With Bunkie getting killed
and this Kidd Fo-Fo mess,

21:05.565 --> 21:07.765
well, maybe it's not the
right time to go public. No.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.734
We do it now.
Look, call the banks

21:09.736 --> 21:11.269
and get them back to the table.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.406
I'll do my best.
Look...

21:15.408 --> 21:19.377
you get this done,
and Empire is yours.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.612
Okay.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.317
I didn't want
to bring this up, but

21:26.319 --> 21:27.952
I don't think
Jamal's press conference

21:27.954 --> 21:29.487
is gonna help the situation.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.256
What press conference?

21:32.258 --> 21:34.558
♪ ♪

21:36.561 --> 21:37.828
That looks good.
That looks good.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.397
Can you come...
Can you come over here?

21:39.399 --> 21:41.098
Behind there.
And you, too.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.267
His hair looks good.

21:43.269 --> 21:46.437
Uh... Yeah.
Mmm.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.506
Rhonda. I want your job.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.074
(laughs)
Hi, fellas.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.410
Some white girls
actually are brilliant.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.845
Oh, there's Dominique. I want
you to meet her real quick.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.314
She's a fabulous
publicist.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.349
I got two minutes,
so make it fast.

21:58.351 --> 22:02.019
Where's the capers? I asked
for capers on the damn bagel.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.955
Um, Dominique,
this is Cookie Lyon.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.424
She's my mother-in-law.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.825
Lucious Lyon's ex-wife.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.260
(laughing):
Oh, Cookie.

22:09.262 --> 22:10.828
It's amazing to meet you.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.296
I've read all about you.

22:12.298 --> 22:13.631
I love your pumps.

22:13.633 --> 22:14.999
(gasps)
They're fabulous.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.667
Oh, thank you,
sister girl.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.102
Sister girl.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.470
(laughing)

22:19.472 --> 22:21.372
I love you.
I absolutely love you.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.174
So, what can I do for you?

22:23.176 --> 22:26.177
Well, I have a son who's a
musical genius like his father.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.679
And he's also a homo.
He wants to come out.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.682
So, what do you want from me? I want
you to organize a press conference.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.984
He could sing a song that
he wrote about coming out

22:33.986 --> 22:35.953
to announce to the
world that he's a gay.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.955
It could be huge.
This is good. This is good.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.691
And she's the best publicist in
the city, so everyone will show.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.126
(laughs)

22:42.128 --> 22:44.328
But I'm not cheap.
$8,000 a month.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.963
Ah. And make sure
the kid shows.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.032
If you're just using me
for my contact,

22:48.034 --> 22:50.668
to stage some kind of
performance, I'll kill Rhonda.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.737
I'm not joking, Rhonda!
I'll kill ya!

22:52.739 --> 22:54.038
I know you will.

22:59.311 --> 23:02.246
Hey, y'all, let's get
another round in for Bunkie.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.081
Now, I'm just getting
this on film so that, like,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.250
it's documented,
but you only put

23:06.252 --> 23:09.487
one lime in this,
and I asked for two.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.855
Give him a lime, man.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.057
Hakeem, tell Tiana
what you think of her.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.892
Right there, man.
Oh.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.228
Tell Tiana what you think of her.
Yes.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.763
Forget about Tiana.
She just jealous.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.564
Hey, baby.
(laughter)

23:20.566 --> 23:24.668
This is your boy Hakeem Lyon,
the original rap gangsta.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.404
(laughter)

23:26.406 --> 23:27.872
I got something for you.

23:27.874 --> 23:30.574
What you got  for her?  A ring?

23:30.576 --> 23:31.675
Aah! Hey!

23:31.677 --> 23:34.578
Oh! Oh, my God!
Stop! Stop!

23:34.580 --> 23:36.847
(urinating)
(laughter)

23:36.849 --> 23:37.915
Oh!

23:37.917 --> 23:39.884
Really?
Oh, no.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.119
What? Yo, you're gonna embarrass
your pops like that, man.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.888
You know. Obama.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.523
You're daddy's
gonna kill you.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.092
Man, so what? Barack
Obama's a sellout.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.928
That brother's not even half of a
brother anyway. Thank you. Thank you.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.197
Thank you.
Somebody know.

23:54.399 --> 23:56.033
For real.
(laughing)

23:57.803 --> 24:00.304
(people whispering)
What?!

24:00.306 --> 24:02.206
Y'all got a problem
with some black boys

24:02.208 --> 24:03.707
in your fine establishment?

24:03.709 --> 24:05.409
(laughter, snickering)

24:05.411 --> 24:08.946
I got enough money to buy
this bitch and everybody in it.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.614
Talk to the
camera, KK.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.082
Check this out.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.251
All you white people
that voted for the first

24:14.253 --> 24:17.988
black president to make you feel
good about not being racist,

24:17.990 --> 24:20.491
the joke's on y'all,

24:20.493 --> 24:24.295
'cause Barack Obama
ain't nothing but a sellout.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.563
Ooh!

24:25.565 --> 24:26.997
MAN:
Oh, come on. Really?

24:26.999 --> 24:30.801
(laughter, snickering)

24:30.803 --> 24:33.237
(siren approaching)

24:33.239 --> 24:35.005
Oh, so the po po comin'
to shoot me now?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.474
(laughter, guffawing)

24:36.476 --> 24:38.075
Oh, no, man.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.743
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

24:39.745 --> 24:42.813
No, man. They gonna be up here
in like ten seconds.

24:48.086 --> 24:50.521
All you white folk who voted
for the first black president

24:50.523 --> 24:52.656
to make you feel good
about not being racist...

24:52.658 --> 24:54.758
He's doing all
the work for us.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.760
...the joke's on y'all
'cause Barack Obama

24:56.762 --> 24:58.362
ain't nothing but a sellout.
It's gone viral.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.197
What's viral?

25:00.199 --> 25:02.633
I don't know. That's what
they said on the news.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.602
Oh, so the po po comin'
to shoot me now?

25:04.604 --> 25:06.504
(laughter)

25:06.506 --> 25:09.173
(laughter and shouting in video)

25:09.175 --> 25:11.175
There ain't nothing
funny about that.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.344
(laughing):
It is funny.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.814
Mr. President,
I am so, so sorry.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.616
You know how
he feels about you.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.217
He loves you.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.219
I love you.
We all love you.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.221
He's just young and stupid

25:24.223 --> 25:27.458
and had a little
too much to drink.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.327
Come on, Barack.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.630
You know you don't have to use
that kind of language with...

25:32.632 --> 25:34.198
(click, dial tone)

25:34.200 --> 25:36.433
Hello?

25:38.637 --> 25:41.872
Do you know the world
that we live in today?

25:41.874 --> 25:44.475
Do you have any idea
what those cops could have done

25:44.477 --> 25:45.976
to your entitled ass?
ANIKA: Lucious!

25:45.978 --> 25:47.311
Stop this! Stop this.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.913
Dad, let me explain.
Get out of here!

25:48.915 --> 25:50.848
Look at me.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.517
(whispers):
Chill out.

25:53.519 --> 25:54.985
(laughs)

25:54.987 --> 25:58.856
You're not gonna believe this,
but press RSVPs

25:58.858 --> 26:01.225
for the Laviticus opening
have quadrupled.

26:01.227 --> 26:04.828
Everyone wants to
see Hakeem perform

26:04.830 --> 26:06.096
since that video went up.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.365
This bad boy thing
has launched him.

26:08.367 --> 26:11.068
(sighs, laughs)

26:12.938 --> 26:14.572
I don't like it.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.607
Yeah. I know.

26:16.609 --> 26:19.209
You're really not
going to like this,

26:19.211 --> 26:22.880
but the Kidd Fo-Fo story
was picked up nationally.

26:22.882 --> 26:25.683
Megan McGann has been ranting
about it all day,

26:25.685 --> 26:27.251
saying that it's
irresponsible

26:27.253 --> 26:29.553
to grant Empire a seat
on the NYSE.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.055
Enough, enough, enough, enough.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.957
(sighs)
Okay.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.059
We're gonna put out
another statement.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.961
No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, we're
gonna put out another statement,

26:36.963 --> 26:39.063
and this time... Oh. All
we're gonna say is just that...

26:39.065 --> 26:40.731
No more statements.
It's not working.

26:40.733 --> 26:43.767
I'll go on her show,
I'll defend my own company.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.070
CNN, OWN and BET said

26:46.072 --> 26:47.471
they all coming
to Jamal's press conference.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.607
COOKIE:
What are they doing in there?

26:49.609 --> 26:53.777
Look like they having
a meeting to me.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.146
ANIKA: "Will you drop
Kidd Fo-Fo from the label,

26:56.148 --> 26:58.282
"and do you feel
rap lyrics are

26:58.284 --> 26:59.950
a dangerous influence
on America's youth?"

26:59.952 --> 27:03.120
I stand by Kidd Fo-Fo 1,000%.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.656
I think that rap
is an expression

27:05.658 --> 27:07.491
of somebody's life experience.
It's not...

27:07.493 --> 27:10.260
That's good, but try not
to sound defensive.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.662
The goal of the talking points

27:11.664 --> 27:13.130
is to make you sound
non-emotional.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.732
I wasn't being defensive.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.233
ANDRE: He's right, Dad.
You don't want

27:16.235 --> 27:18.769
to come across
as confrontational.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.304
Or like a man.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.907
And what's that supposed
to mean?

27:23.909 --> 27:26.543
Oh, just sounds like
you grew a vagina, that's all.

27:27.278 --> 27:28.012
Rude.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.647
No more rude

27:29.649 --> 27:32.182
than that anchorwoman haircut
you slop on your head.

27:32.184 --> 27:36.253
Lucious? Cookie, I got
to go on white TV and try

27:36.255 --> 27:37.655
and talk in a way

27:37.657 --> 27:40.190
that don't frighten these folks
to death.

27:42.627 --> 27:45.829
The Lucious Lyon I knew
would tell those idiots

27:45.831 --> 27:48.265
the streets ain't made
for everybody.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.601
That's why they made sidewalks.

27:52.537 --> 27:55.873
The Lucious Lyon you knew
isn't going on that show.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.676
Yeah, I guess
you right, Kitty.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.580
I liked you better
when you was a thug.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.920
(phone ringing)

28:22.834 --> 28:25.235
Thank you.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.871
(sighs)

28:31.042 --> 28:33.310
I don't know
how many times

28:33.312 --> 28:36.313
I can keep having
the same conversation with you.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.515
Out of respect for Bunkie,
I'm asking you, please...

28:38.517 --> 28:40.217
Are you serious?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.186
Don't do that.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.388
Bunkie had no problem
with me, and you know it.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.057
Yeah, well, other people do,
and you know it.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.326
Look, if you make
that announcement,

28:49.328 --> 28:52.830
I'm going to lose artists,
which will hurt Empire.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.198
I'm sorry, Dad.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.900
The world does not
revolve around you.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.405
Your world does.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.340
I pay for everything.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.375
Your clothes,

29:05.377 --> 29:10.013
that $12,000-a-month loft
you live in,

29:10.015 --> 29:11.715
the credit card bills,

29:11.717 --> 29:15.519
your brand-new piano
you just bought.

29:15.521 --> 29:20.023
Come out,
and you're on your own.

29:20.025 --> 29:22.626
I'm done.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.601
Who's here? CNN? BET?

29:30.603 --> 29:33.203
Is OWN here?
If she cancels, I'll kill her.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.905
Did he answer?
He not answering.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.774
Keep calling.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.809
(playing gentle melody)

29:38.811 --> 29:41.478
(phone buzzing, ringing)

29:46.084 --> 29:49.820
Hey. So where's that gay genius
I've been hearing so much about?

29:49.822 --> 29:51.388
He's coming.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.823
I expect him here.
Okay.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.658
What the hell are you doing?
Where is he?

29:54.660 --> 29:56.059
He's not here yet?

29:56.061 --> 29:58.162
No! Call him.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.930
Today, we are here
with hip-hop mogul

29:59.932 --> 30:03.333
and superstar Lucious Lyon,
whose artist, Kidd Fo-Fo,

30:03.335 --> 30:05.669
was accused
of inciting a shooting

30:05.671 --> 30:07.337
with his violent lyrics.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.139
Thank you for being
here, Mr. Lyon.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.574
You can call me Lucious.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.075
First off, um,

30:12.077 --> 30:14.244
I have to commend your son,
Hakeem Lyon,

30:14.246 --> 30:15.679
who recently accused

42:07.525 --> 42:08.892
WOMAN:
Hey, Cookie.

42:08.894 --> 42:10.460
Get in the car.
Aw, hell no.

42:10.462 --> 42:12.695
Get in the car. Now.

42:14.164 --> 42:15.632
Let's go. In the car.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.867
Get off of me.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.437
(sighs)

42:22.840 --> 42:25.174
Nice to see you
again, Cookie.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.644
Nice to see you again,
Agent Carter.

42:27.646 --> 42:30.346
So you've been
avoiding my calls, right?

42:30.348 --> 42:32.215
I ain't got nothing else
to say to you.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.883
We had a deal. I did my part.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.852
Yeah, I know we had a deal.

42:35.854 --> 42:37.887
But you know what, Cookie,

42:37.889 --> 42:40.890
we're gonna
have to change that deal.

42:42.026 --> 42:43.826
"Send."

42:43.828 --> 42:46.062
Okay.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.400
We need you to testify
in front of a grand jury.

42:50.402 --> 42:53.770
No. I cannot testify.

42:53.772 --> 42:55.972
If I testify, I'm dead.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.609
(sighs)

43:01.712 --> 43:03.913
You gonna get me killed.
