<i>In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</i>

00:23.563 --> 00:24.647
<i>Amen.</i>

00:43.505 --> 00:44.401
Hannah.

00:48.287 --> 00:49.285
Hannah.

01:01.101 --> 01:02.102
Hannah.

01:16.590 --> 01:17.601
No.

01:21.187 --> 01:25.169
God himself commands you,

01:25.263 --> 01:29.043
depart from the body
of Hannah Grace, you demon,

01:29.079 --> 01:31.971
along with every satanic power
of the enemy,

01:32.018 --> 01:35.397
along with every specter
from hell.

01:35.433 --> 01:36.464
Stop!

01:36.649 --> 01:38.279
Hannah,
I know you're in there.

01:42.284 --> 01:43.898
You have to fight, baby.

01:46.199 --> 01:47.264
Fight it, Hannah.

01:48.593 --> 01:51.254
Fight it.
Fight it, Hannah.

01:51.869 --> 01:53.488
You have to fight.

01:58.359 --> 02:00.727
Baby, it's me.

02:01.842 --> 02:03.912
- Dad.
- Daddy's here, baby.

02:04.011 --> 02:06.442
- Dad.
- Honey. Baby.

02:06.967 --> 02:07.773
Dad.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.527
You have to fight.

02:18.987 --> 02:21.549
In the name of the Father,
in the name of the Son,

02:21.585 --> 02:23.975
in the name of
the Holy Spirit.

02:49.116 --> 02:50.806
Hannah, stop!

03:03.601 --> 03:04.533
No.

03:23.858 --> 03:26.002
Your whore daughter is mine.

03:26.780 --> 03:28.763
She's mine forever.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.845
Forgive me.

05:37.532 --> 05:40.696
<i>Meg. Hey, it's Lisa.
I just talked to Dr. Lewis</i>

05:40.732 --> 05:43.105
<i>and you're good to go,
so maybe you can</i>

05:43.141 --> 05:45.271
<i>come in this afternoon.
Okay, bye.</i>

06:08.894 --> 06:10.260
Hey.

06:11.769 --> 06:13.518
You look nervous.
Are you okay?

06:13.730 --> 06:16.382
It's a job interview. I think
I'm supposed to be nervous.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.321
Okay. Come on,
let's go get a coffee.

06:18.823 --> 06:19.911
<i>This will be good.</i>

06:20.234 --> 06:22.790
We'll go to meetings in
the morning after our shifts end

06:22.826 --> 06:25.714
and I'll be three floors up,
so if you need anything...

06:26.744 --> 06:27.597
You know?

06:29.205 --> 06:30.552
Thank you for this.

06:31.203 --> 06:35.432
Don't thank me yet. You still
have to meet Dr. Lewis.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.563
<i>This job is not for everyone.</i>

06:37.626 --> 06:39.359
We've had three overnight
intake assistants

06:39.395 --> 06:41.100
in the last
six months alone.

06:41.160 --> 06:41.931
Because of the hours?

06:41.967 --> 06:44.690
No, because it's a thankless,
solitary position.

06:44.758 --> 06:47.152
The smell. You never get used
to the smell.

06:47.255 --> 06:50.152
I was a cop. I'm totally
used to bad smells.

06:50.188 --> 06:53.219
Lisa mentioned
that there were issues.

06:54.912 --> 06:58.569
Yes. There were issues.
But I'm much better now.

06:59.858 --> 07:02.123
Well, she assured me
that you could handle the job.

07:02.788 --> 07:04.653
Is it something you think
you can handle?

07:05.280 --> 07:06.465
I can handle it.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.129
<i>Going down.</i>

07:14.293 --> 07:16.858
It gets to you after a while,
being here.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.726
People get creeped out.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.583
Before you know it, their
imaginations are running wild,

07:21.619 --> 07:24.317
they're hearing things
go bump in the night.

07:24.534 --> 07:25.513
Not me.

07:26.786 --> 07:29.142
I believe when you die,
you die.

07:29.352 --> 07:31.776
End of story.

07:31.908 --> 07:33.374
Good.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.117
<i>Arrived at morgue.</i>

07:36.710 --> 07:39.085
At night,
you can't get in or out

07:39.218 --> 07:41.083
without swiping
this card.

07:41.119 --> 07:43.784
If you lose it, hospital
security has to let you in.

07:43.878 --> 07:45.543
They will not be happy.

07:48.028 --> 07:50.093
Most of the lights
are on a sensor.

07:50.306 --> 07:52.692
The rest you have
to switch on manually.

07:57.331 --> 07:58.445
There are a lot
of files that

07:58.481 --> 08:00.271
need to be entered
into the system.

08:00.317 --> 08:02.093
I hope you
don't mind data entry.

08:02.159 --> 08:03.370
No, not at all.

08:04.925 --> 08:07.357
Men's room is down there,
women's room is down there,

08:07.490 --> 08:08.768
and down there to the left

08:08.804 --> 08:10.864
is the incinerator room
for cremation.

08:12.917 --> 08:14.295
<i>Intake bay.</i>

08:15.532 --> 08:18.197
This intake
bay is for drop-offs only.

08:18.516 --> 08:20.788
No drop-off, no access.

08:20.824 --> 08:23.074
And you never leave the premises
while you're on duty.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.528
No exceptions.

08:24.564 --> 08:26.582
<i>Arrived at morgue.</i>

08:26.646 --> 08:29.330
Well, you bring the cadaver up
from the intake bay,

08:29.393 --> 08:32.714
and take it into the receiving
room, which is over here.

08:32.777 --> 08:33.995
<i>Image captured.</i>

08:34.030 --> 08:36.842
First you take an overview of
the body and then close-ups

08:36.879 --> 08:38.890
of each individual injury.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.182
- <i>Image captured.</i>
- All right, you try.

08:43.905 --> 08:47.368
Rigor mortis makes a corpse
difficult to fingerprint.

08:47.404 --> 08:49.302
Now, if you press on
the knuckle, it will extend

08:49.363 --> 08:51.646
the finger,
and make it easier to handle.

08:52.409 --> 08:54.879
Gently roll.

08:55.006 --> 08:55.866
<i>Scanning.</i>

08:55.941 --> 08:58.646
This doohickey sends the prints
to a crime database.

08:58.734 --> 09:01.835
Green means they're ready to go.
Red means they're not.

09:02.008 --> 09:02.893
Yeah.

09:03.679 --> 09:05.199
Green...

09:05.809 --> 09:07.277
Green means go.

09:13.221 --> 09:15.186
- Thanks, Moe.
- You bet, Doc.

09:15.279 --> 09:16.948
The shift starts
tomorrow night at 11,

09:16.984 --> 09:19.116
goes to 7 in the morning.

09:19.312 --> 09:21.786
- Any problems with that?
- Not at all.

09:21.874 --> 09:24.280
Well, thank you
for the opportunity.

09:24.754 --> 09:26.918
I promise
you won't be disappointed.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.203
Welcome to the team.

11:05.340 --> 11:06.705
Thanks.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.244
Hey, do you need
to see my I.D.?

11:18.323 --> 11:19.797
Do you work here?

11:19.876 --> 11:22.006
In the morgue.
I'm Megan.

11:22.084 --> 11:23.293
Then no.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.329
Hey, I'm Dave.

11:30.639 --> 11:32.426
- Megan.
- Nice to meet you.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.357
And, you know, welcome
to the graveyard shift.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.804
Thanks.

11:53.711 --> 11:55.410
<i>Morgue.</i>

12:43.967 --> 12:45.372
<i>Intake bay.</i>

13:00.330 --> 13:02.945
<i>Arrived at intake bay.</i>

13:13.756 --> 13:15.401
Who are you? Where's Larry?

13:15.478 --> 13:17.740
I don't know who Larry is,
but I'm Megan.

13:24.245 --> 13:25.457
<i>Morgue.</i>

13:30.440 --> 13:32.973
You've got to be the right kind
to stomach a job like this.

13:33.809 --> 13:35.242
Personally...

13:35.555 --> 13:37.517
I'm not what you'd call
a people person.

13:38.522 --> 13:40.147
Dead's the way
I like them.

14:06.489 --> 14:07.668
<i>Image captured.</i>

14:17.383 --> 14:18.726
<i>Scanning.</i>

14:21.202 --> 14:22.832
Green means go.

14:39.374 --> 14:40.603
Hey.

14:40.979 --> 14:43.050
- Goddamn it, Dave.
- Sorry.

14:43.086 --> 14:44.202
Not funny.

14:44.271 --> 14:45.211
I didn't mean to.

14:45.247 --> 14:47.581
I honestly just came down
to check on you.

14:47.731 --> 14:50.676
Shit. I feel like an asshole.
Forgive me?

14:53.525 --> 14:54.985
I'll never do it again.

14:56.068 --> 14:57.574
Really not funny.

15:41.618 --> 15:42.742
Hey.

15:49.184 --> 15:52.248
- <i>Why didn't you shoot me?</i>
- <i>Megan, do something.</i>

16:11.427 --> 16:13.491
<i>I don't know what
triggers it, really.</i>

16:15.432 --> 16:17.319
<i>A lot of things, I guess.</i>

16:21.628 --> 16:23.647
But I still have nightmares
of what happened.

16:26.974 --> 16:28.559
Put your hands up!

16:32.136 --> 16:33.483
Me just...

16:35.063 --> 16:36.399
standing there...

16:37.265 --> 16:38.491
doing nothing.

16:44.820 --> 16:47.518
I just freeze up
and I can't move.

16:56.681 --> 16:58.649
<i>Officer down. Officer down.</i>

17:01.777 --> 17:05.340
It's okay. I've got you.
I've got you.

17:07.532 --> 17:09.642
I want it so bad sometimes.

17:10.936 --> 17:14.074
The drink and the pills,
I want them so bad.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.566
Thank you, Megan,
for sharing.

17:42.964 --> 17:43.819
Hey.

17:45.528 --> 17:49.025
I just, um, need
the rest of my stuff.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.751
My shift just ended,
but if this is a bad time...

17:52.860 --> 17:54.540
No. No, come in.

18:00.161 --> 18:02.537
And you're still in
your pajamas because...?

18:03.477 --> 18:05.176
Oh, I, uh...

18:05.419 --> 18:09.814
I started a new job
last night. A night job.

18:10.063 --> 18:11.195
That's great.

18:13.034 --> 18:14.705
Doing what?

18:14.785 --> 18:17.682
Overnight intake assistant
at the morgue.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.139
It's better
than it sounds.

18:21.235 --> 18:25.122
Yeah, I'm basically running the
place at night, all on my own.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.387
Are you sure that's
a good idea, you know...

18:27.520 --> 18:29.285
spending so much time alone
right now?

18:29.418 --> 18:31.642
Actually, I do.
You know,

18:31.690 --> 18:33.060
it keeps me from
going out at night

18:33.099 --> 18:35.069
doing things I might regret
in the morning.

18:35.125 --> 18:36.345
It worked for Lisa
and she thinks

18:36.381 --> 18:37.771
it could work
for me, too.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.363
- "Lisa"?
- My AA sponsor.

18:41.472 --> 18:43.130
The nurse at the hospital.

18:44.397 --> 18:45.532
She says it keeps her
out of trouble

18:45.568 --> 18:47.134
working the night shift.

18:47.340 --> 18:50.064
So, when a job opened up at
the morgue, she thought of me.

18:50.100 --> 18:53.454
Yeah, still, too much time alone
is never good for anyone.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.119
Says the guy who moved out.

18:57.111 --> 18:59.125
You didn't give me
much of a choice.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.493
That's not true, Andrew.
You know that's not true.

19:01.529 --> 19:04.082
Since when are you concerned
about the truth?

19:11.843 --> 19:13.440
I didn't come to...

19:15.540 --> 19:16.468
I should go.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.690
<i>Intake bay.</i>

19:52.373 --> 19:55.370
<i>Arrived at intake bay.</i>

20:19.113 --> 20:22.327
I forgot my key.
Could you open the door?

20:23.615 --> 20:24.899
You don't work here.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.865
Yes, I do.
Just let me in.

20:29.525 --> 20:32.566
- Sir, back away from the door.
- No. No. No.

20:32.602 --> 20:34.400
- Sir.
- Let me in!

20:36.001 --> 20:38.485
I'm going to call security.
Back away from the door.

20:40.415 --> 20:42.337
- <i>Morgue.</i>
- Let me in!

20:43.060 --> 20:44.377
Let me in!

20:51.956 --> 20:52.905
<i>Security.</i>

20:52.941 --> 20:55.424
Hey, I had a homeless guy
at the intake bay.

20:55.460 --> 20:58.333
<i>Thanks for the heads-up.
Yeah, we get that a lot.</i>

20:58.678 --> 20:59.603
Yeah.

21:05.879 --> 21:08.909
<i>Arrived at intake bay.</i>

21:16.239 --> 21:18.769
- Drop-off?
- Hey, yeah.

21:19.722 --> 21:21.210
Ooh. You're new here.

21:21.711 --> 21:23.460
- Megan.
- Randy.

21:24.269 --> 21:26.975
Could you give me a hand?
I'm all alone tonight.

21:27.396 --> 21:29.638
Sorry. I can't leave
the premises.

21:30.409 --> 21:34.011
Yes. Yeah.
Stickler on the rules.

21:34.789 --> 21:36.388
But I'll tell you right now,

21:37.480 --> 21:40.179
if you don't help me get
this thing inside,

21:40.215 --> 21:41.505
it's going to start
to rot and decay.

21:41.541 --> 21:43.605
It's just going to blow up
like a puffer fish.

21:44.133 --> 21:46.127
And then we're both going
to lose our jobs.

21:48.026 --> 21:49.258
Unless...

21:50.629 --> 21:52.574
- What do you think?
- All right, okay. Fine.

21:52.610 --> 21:53.780
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:54.275 --> 21:58.142
You're the best. My partner
called in sick. Strep throat.

21:58.587 --> 22:01.557
Which is 100 percent
grade-A bullshit because...

22:01.593 --> 22:02.672
- Do you want to grab that side?
- Yeah.

22:02.804 --> 22:05.662
He is holing up with
his psycho ex-girlfriend.

22:07.739 --> 22:09.820
It seems like he should
be making some new friends.

22:09.856 --> 22:11.196
Yeah, I think
he should probably pick

22:11.232 --> 22:13.368
a better psycho
ex-girlfriend next time.

22:15.826 --> 22:18.084
So, I want to say
thank you, by the way,

22:18.120 --> 22:19.892
because the guy
who used to have this job

22:19.928 --> 22:21.885
would never have
just done that.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.583
He was a prick.
Horrendous breath.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.241
- How long have you been here?
- I just started.

22:29.606 --> 22:31.893
<i>Arrived at morgue.</i>

22:36.826 --> 22:39.128
- What happened?
- Oh, yeah, it's a bad one.

22:39.164 --> 22:42.165
The cops found her in an alley.
One, two, three.

22:42.336 --> 22:43.935
Yeah.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.756
Yeah, so the guy
was still slicing her.

22:48.084 --> 22:50.305
He took off. They still
haven't found him.

22:50.341 --> 22:53.188
- Did they find out who he was?
- No clue.

22:56.118 --> 22:57.746
"Hannah Grace."

22:58.138 --> 23:00.017
Yeah, that's what
it said on her I.D.

23:09.396 --> 23:10.834
I told you it was bad.

23:11.154 --> 23:14.061
That's not even the insane
thing. The insane thing is

23:14.133 --> 23:16.071
they found chloroform
by her body.

23:17.866 --> 23:21.573
What kind of a lunatic drugs
a girl, smashes her head in,

23:21.609 --> 23:24.627
and then tries to burn her body
after she's been dead?

23:26.667 --> 23:27.316
I'll tell you who it is.

23:27.352 --> 23:28.925
It's someone trying
to send a message.

23:28.961 --> 23:30.210
It could have
been her pimp.

23:30.246 --> 23:31.877
It might have been
a drug dealer.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.811
It could have been
a sex thing.

23:37.190 --> 23:38.989
Thanks, Randy.
I can take it from here.

23:39.025 --> 23:40.244
You got it. Yeah.

23:40.311 --> 23:41.531
All right.

23:47.017 --> 23:48.619
Thanks for the help,
Megan.

23:49.448 --> 23:51.046
Yeah.

23:51.370 --> 23:52.261
<i>Intake bay.</i>

23:52.297 --> 23:54.661
It gets easier.
I promise.

23:56.408 --> 23:58.006
Thanks.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.554
It's all part of the job.

Get out of here.

30:53.525 --> 30:55.323
You're losing your mind.

31:16.155 --> 31:17.934
It's freaking hot.

31:48.157 --> 31:49.470
Dave?

31:54.421 --> 31:56.286
Dave, you promised.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.516
Dave!

32:25.581 --> 32:27.452
Oh, my God.

33:07.949 --> 33:11.180
If you scream, I will
have to slit your throat.

33:11.566 --> 33:12.646
Do you understand?

33:12.682 --> 33:13.878
Yes.

33:15.067 --> 33:16.316
Do you understand?

33:53.150 --> 33:54.424
- Come on.
- <i>Security.</i>

33:54.460 --> 33:56.151
There's someone down here.
Call the police now.

33:56.187 --> 33:57.717
<i>What?</i>

34:35.496 --> 34:38.674
"As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

34:39.429 --> 34:42.426
And lead us not
into temptation,

34:42.741 --> 34:44.206
but deliver us from evil."

34:44.242 --> 34:47.509
Stop. Put the body down.

34:47.603 --> 34:50.500
I've already called security.
There's nowhere for you to go.

34:56.141 --> 34:59.581
- Now, just stay calm.
- You don't understand.

34:59.617 --> 35:00.867
Megan!

35:00.954 --> 35:02.436
Megan!

35:02.472 --> 35:03.837
Megan!

35:13.415 --> 35:16.711
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

35:17.106 --> 35:18.804
Please, listen to me!

35:20.494 --> 35:22.444
- You've got to destroy her body.
- Get him up!

35:22.480 --> 35:24.593
- You're coming with us.
- Please, listen to me.

35:24.629 --> 35:26.199
- Listen. Listen.
- Are you okay?

35:26.235 --> 35:29.435
You have to destroy her body.
You've got to destroy her body.

35:30.724 --> 35:32.373
You don't know
what you've done!

35:32.566 --> 35:35.603
You don't know what you...
She's not dead!

35:35.845 --> 35:36.911
Stop.

37:12.691 --> 37:13.447
Hello?

37:13.483 --> 37:15.433
<i>Megan, it's Andrew.
I just heard</i>

37:15.469 --> 37:17.134
<i>what happened.
Are you okay?</i>

37:17.669 --> 37:20.416
Yeah, I'm fine, but I'm going
to have to call you back.

38:12.419 --> 38:14.781
Hey, can you open
the door?

38:17.573 --> 38:19.703
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

38:19.988 --> 38:22.740
- Did that guy hurt you?
- No. No, not really.

38:23.246 --> 38:26.482
- I'm fine.
- Do you want to call it a night?

38:26.518 --> 38:27.913
I can find someone else
to cover your shift.

38:27.949 --> 38:30.108
I'm okay. Seriously,
Lisa, I'm fine.

38:30.144 --> 38:31.574
Nobody is going
to hold it against you

38:31.610 --> 38:32.833
if you just want to
get out of here.

38:32.869 --> 38:35.037
I know. But
I want to stay. Okay?

38:35.073 --> 38:36.970
I can do this.
I want to do this.

38:37.037 --> 38:38.935
- But you don't have to.
- Lisa.

38:39.884 --> 38:42.482
I need to do this.

38:46.341 --> 38:47.358
Okay.

38:51.691 --> 38:52.721
What is it?

38:56.951 --> 39:00.115
I know this is going
to sound insane, but...

39:02.631 --> 39:05.461
I heard a corpse breathe.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.198
- Breathe?
- Yes.

39:09.287 --> 39:10.599
Like...

39:10.977 --> 39:12.301
an exhale.

39:15.158 --> 39:18.588
Corpses expunge air sometimes
when they're moved.

39:18.941 --> 39:21.115
Dr. Lewis
didn't tell you this?

39:23.151 --> 39:25.448
In his defense, he...

39:26.317 --> 39:27.986
probably assumed
I was smart enough

39:28.044 --> 39:30.575
to know that corpses
can't breathe.

39:33.084 --> 39:34.447
Are you hungry?

39:35.181 --> 39:37.270
I can get us some take-out
from the cafeteria.

39:38.028 --> 39:39.846
- Sure.
- Okay, come on.

39:48.872 --> 39:50.925
You know, when that guy
attacked me tonight...

39:53.329 --> 39:55.381
my first instinct
wasn't to run.

39:57.638 --> 40:00.280
You know,
I wanted to defend myself,

40:00.734 --> 40:01.991
to stop him.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.409
I didn't freeze.

40:04.789 --> 40:06.876
Why couldn't
I have done that

40:07.072 --> 40:09.470
when there was a gun
pointed at my partner?

40:09.845 --> 40:11.964
And then none of this
would have happened.

40:12.661 --> 40:15.567
Look, it's just
one step at a time.

40:17.445 --> 40:19.676
This job is the next step.

40:28.148 --> 40:29.901
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:29.937 --> 40:32.180
There is a cop upstairs
who wants to talk to you.

40:33.441 --> 40:34.846
I can cover down here
if you want.

40:35.432 --> 40:36.747
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

40:37.562 --> 40:39.827
- How's your arm?
- Oh, it's good as new.

40:40.894 --> 40:41.971
Do you want some fries?

40:42.159 --> 40:43.581
Um...

40:43.729 --> 40:46.393
- Sure. Thanks.
- Here. See you.

41:33.413 --> 41:35.901
You didn't have to come here.
They already have my statement.

41:35.937 --> 41:38.009
Yeah, I know.
I was in the area.

41:39.400 --> 41:42.297
Are you okay?
He didn't hurt you?

41:43.145 --> 41:46.161
Just my ego.
Did you I.D. him yet?

41:46.293 --> 41:47.958
No, he's not talking.

41:48.317 --> 41:50.393
We'll know more once
we get him to the station.

41:52.912 --> 41:54.459
You seem anxious.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.230
Are you staying
through the night?

41:58.287 --> 41:59.513
That's the plan.

42:01.891 --> 42:04.084
I just know how you get
when you're stressed.

42:04.220 --> 42:06.045
Okay, look, I appreciate
you coming here,

42:06.081 --> 42:07.513
but I've got things covered.

42:08.721 --> 42:09.860
Okay?

42:12.904 --> 42:14.369
Is there something else?

42:15.611 --> 42:17.359
I know this
isn't the right time...

42:20.292 --> 42:23.822
but when I picked up my stuff,
there was something missing.

42:25.173 --> 42:26.505
A bottle of Xanax.

42:27.907 --> 42:29.564
And you're assuming
that I...

42:30.479 --> 42:31.753
what, stole them from you?

42:31.789 --> 42:34.026
Did you?

42:34.062 --> 42:35.250
It's a valid question.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.306
You're not supposed
to be around

42:36.377 --> 42:37.775
controlled medications
of any kind.

42:37.811 --> 42:40.107
You misplace a bottle of pills
and automatically assume this.

42:40.172 --> 42:41.202
Why are you getting
so defensive?

42:41.280 --> 42:43.544
I'm not getting defensive.
I'm getting pissed.

42:44.135 --> 42:46.099
You know, it's as if
you're completely incapable

42:46.135 --> 42:48.300
of giving me
the benefit of the doubt.

42:56.998 --> 43:00.595
If you ever need my help,
I'm just a call away. Okay?

43:02.644 --> 43:04.904
Actually, there is something
you can help me with.

43:04.994 --> 43:06.122
I'll be right back.

43:08.764 --> 43:09.616
Hey.

43:10.385 --> 43:12.716
- How's it going?
- I'm good. How are you?

43:15.896 --> 43:17.651
I'll just be another minute
if that's okay.

43:17.687 --> 43:19.418
Yeah, no problem.
Take your time.

43:30.605 --> 43:33.317
Bases loaded, three-and-two
count, down by three.

43:33.353 --> 43:36.283
The stakes
could not be higher.

43:36.560 --> 43:39.344
Here comes the pitch.
It's a heater.

43:41.078 --> 43:44.208
It's a grand slam!

44:07.951 --> 44:09.981
Can you run these
for me at the station?

44:10.057 --> 44:12.421
The scanner broke down
before I could run her prints.

44:12.823 --> 44:15.208
- Her?
- Hannah Grace.

44:43.910 --> 44:45.412
<i>You already have her I.D.</i>

44:45.448 --> 44:47.219
I think that I.D. is fake.

44:47.314 --> 44:49.418
The picture
on her license doesn't match.

44:49.489 --> 44:51.705
Her eye color,
it's different.

44:52.613 --> 44:54.702
- What?
- Once a cop...

44:59.282 --> 45:00.927
Just get me the prints,
okay?

45:02.348 --> 45:03.360
You got it.

46:50.761 --> 46:51.847
Dave?

47:05.454 --> 47:07.039
I mean, seriously.

47:22.294 --> 47:23.360
Dave?

47:32.377 --> 47:33.385
Dave?

48:17.870 --> 48:18.829
Hello?

48:28.432 --> 48:31.129
Dave, is that you?

49:45.141 --> 49:46.902
Are you sure you gave me
the right prints?

49:47.204 --> 49:49.677
- Positive.
- The results are odd.

49:50.033 --> 49:51.325
Why do you say that?

49:51.361 --> 49:52.830
<i>Because
according to the prints,</i>

49:52.866 --> 49:55.187
<i>Hannah Grace has been dead
for three months.</i>

49:55.223 --> 49:56.896
It must be a glitch
in the system.

49:56.932 --> 49:58.352
It wouldn't be
the first time.

49:59.864 --> 50:01.393
Is everything else okay?

50:03.097 --> 50:03.955
<i>Megan.</i>

50:06.785 --> 50:08.654
Yeah, thanks.

51:03.788 --> 51:05.365
Wait, what?

51:49.838 --> 51:53.135
Hey, Dave,
where the hell are you, man?

51:58.881 --> 52:00.617
Is everything all right?

52:00.728 --> 52:03.818
- The security cameras downstairs...
- Yeah?

52:03.882 --> 52:05.662
Can I access
the morgue footage?

52:06.368 --> 52:08.755
I can't leave the desk
unmanned, but...

52:09.361 --> 52:10.804
here you go.

52:10.928 --> 52:11.927
Thanks.

53:04.399 --> 53:06.563
Oh, my God.

53:24.972 --> 53:27.836
Come on, Megan. Just breathe.

53:34.469 --> 53:38.198
<i>Lab Tech
Hernandez, please dial 1-6-6-7.</i>

53:38.331 --> 53:40.856
Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

53:40.968 --> 53:43.066
Yeah. Excuse me.

53:44.525 --> 53:47.739
So, I thought I saw
someone in the bathroom.

53:47.786 --> 53:49.848
When I went to check
the security footage,

53:49.904 --> 53:52.150
I mean,
I could have sworn it was her.

53:52.284 --> 53:55.381
Meg, who is "her"?
What are you talking about?

53:55.514 --> 53:57.379
I need to show you
something.

53:57.512 --> 53:59.477
There.

53:59.610 --> 54:01.841
What is that?

54:02.075 --> 54:03.506
I don't know.

54:03.764 --> 54:06.828
Well, I mean,
it looks like a shadow.

54:06.961 --> 54:08.393
It's not a shadow.

54:08.526 --> 54:10.990
Look,
when that guy broke in...

54:11.223 --> 54:13.688
he kept talking
about the woman he killed...

54:13.821 --> 54:16.485
Hannah Grace,
how she wasn't really dead.

54:16.618 --> 54:17.764
I looked her up.

54:17.820 --> 54:20.285
She died three months ago
during an exorcism.

54:23.185 --> 54:26.283
You know I don't believe
in that kind of stuff, but...

54:27.615 --> 54:31.011
...this, to me,
is not a shadow.

54:35.336 --> 54:36.440
What is this?

54:41.947 --> 54:45.428
Lisa, I didn't take any.

54:45.464 --> 54:48.195
- Are you lying to me?
- No, okay?

54:48.328 --> 54:50.193
You need to believe me
on this one.

54:50.326 --> 54:52.090
I promise you,
I didn't take any.

54:52.224 --> 54:54.189
I wanted to, but I didn't.

54:54.322 --> 54:58.484
I've just had them in my bag
for comfort. I promise.

54:58.617 --> 55:00.582
Meg, do you...?

55:02.447 --> 55:04.512
Do you remember
when we were in meetings

55:04.645 --> 55:07.275
and they started talking
about coping mechanisms?

55:07.409 --> 55:08.508
Yeah.

55:08.641 --> 55:10.091
An addict's brain
tries to find

55:10.155 --> 55:11.939
new ways
to cope with stress.

55:11.994 --> 55:14.085
Everything that has happened
to you today,

55:14.135 --> 55:15.568
the stress
that it has caused,

55:15.700 --> 55:18.531
your brain is desperate
to find a way to cope with it.

55:18.664 --> 55:20.359
And it is going to do
anything it can

55:20.395 --> 55:22.227
to convince you to use again.

55:22.361 --> 55:25.008
My brain did not put a corpse
on the security footage.

55:25.044 --> 55:26.860
Look, I don't know
what that thing is,

55:26.939 --> 55:28.415
but what I do know
is you're jumping

55:28.451 --> 55:30.183
to the least plausible
explanation.

55:30.252 --> 55:33.016
And right now
you've got to focus.

55:34.549 --> 55:36.613
So, don't see things
that aren't there.

55:38.211 --> 55:39.404
- Here.
- No.

55:39.457 --> 55:41.589
- Just take them.
- No.

55:44.073 --> 55:45.308
I trust you.

55:53.863 --> 55:54.862
Okay.

56:35.187 --> 56:36.553
Dave?

56:36.686 --> 56:38.351
Are you okay?

56:38.652 --> 56:39.584
Dave?

56:50.745 --> 56:52.577
Dave?

58:29.635 --> 58:31.433
<i>Intake bay.</i>

58:35.415 --> 58:37.014
<i>I brought you a present.</i>

58:37.147 --> 58:39.350
- Can you give me a hand again?
- Sorry. I can't help you out.

58:39.411 --> 58:43.773
- Not after last time.
- What? Why? What happened?

58:44.541 --> 58:46.482
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

58:46.609 --> 58:49.751
Okay. Well, try me.

58:52.311 --> 58:53.902
So, it's obviously
been a long night...

58:53.985 --> 58:56.464
and I'm probably
just remembering things wrong.

58:57.750 --> 58:59.679
She had a huge wound...

58:59.798 --> 59:00.941
going down this side
of her abdomen

59:00.977 --> 59:03.375
when you dropped her off.
Correct?

59:04.966 --> 59:06.897
Yeah, I could have sworn
that she did.

59:07.772 --> 59:09.580
So, where is it now?

59:09.866 --> 59:11.864
And her arm was banged up
too, right?

59:11.998 --> 59:14.395
Yeah. Have you checked
the admittance photos?

59:14.529 --> 59:17.057
The camera broke down and when
I tried to scan her prints,

59:17.093 --> 59:18.451
the scanner died too.

59:20.023 --> 59:21.988
That's weird.

59:23.453 --> 59:25.024
So, I had a friend
run her prints

59:25.060 --> 59:26.558
at the police station.

59:26.701 --> 59:27.420
And?

59:27.480 --> 59:28.621
Hannah Grace,

59:28.657 --> 59:30.987
she died three months ago
during an exorcism.

59:33.266 --> 59:35.605
- Whoa.
- When that man broke in,

59:35.641 --> 59:37.468
he said she wasn't
really dead,

59:37.531 --> 59:41.126
and now it's almost like
she's healing herself.

59:44.815 --> 59:46.480
Can I ask you
a personal question?

59:49.174 --> 59:50.607
How personal?

59:50.771 --> 59:55.064
Why are you working
the night shift at a morgue?

59:56.919 --> 59:58.384
Because it's my job.

59:58.518 --> 01:00:01.748
No, no. You're smart
and resourceful.

01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:03.540
So, what happened?

01:00:04.733 --> 01:00:06.236
You know what?
Actually, it's not even...

01:00:06.272 --> 01:00:08.362
I'm sorry.
It's not my business.

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.670
I...

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:14.669
I had a rough patch
a few years back and...

01:00:14.801 --> 01:00:18.199
I don't know, I guess
I thought I saw that in you.

01:00:18.331 --> 01:00:20.372
I'm sure that there is
a rational explanation

01:00:20.518 --> 01:00:22.050
for all of this.

01:00:22.294 --> 01:00:25.757
You just... Megan,
you've got to be careful

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:27.788
that you don't
drive yourself crazy here.

01:00:27.922 --> 01:00:29.353
I know.

01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:40.342
He's adorable.

01:00:40.476 --> 01:00:43.739
I used to have
a drinking problem.

01:00:43.872 --> 01:00:46.104
And I would get drunk...

01:00:46.236 --> 01:00:50.167
and lie and cheat and...

01:00:50.299 --> 01:00:52.963
people told me
that I was a dick sometimes.

01:00:53.196 --> 01:00:54.728
All the time.

01:00:56.326 --> 01:00:57.659
And then...

01:00:57.792 --> 01:00:59.923
this guy shows up...

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.687
and he made me want
to be a better person.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.251
So...

01:01:05.384 --> 01:01:07.282
I quit drinking...

01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:08.681
I quit lying...

01:01:09.843 --> 01:01:11.533
and then I was finally
able to be honest

01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:13.101
with the people
that love me...

01:01:13.842 --> 01:01:16.906
because I was finally able
to be honest with myself.

01:01:24.465 --> 01:01:27.529
If you ever want to talk,
I'm the guy.

01:01:27.662 --> 01:01:30.159
Thank you.

01:01:30.292 --> 01:01:34.123
- Have a good night.
- You, too. Get home safe.

01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:35.920
<i>Intake bay.</i>

01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:53.403
Hey, I was just about
to call you.

01:01:53.536 --> 01:01:56.633
That bottle of Xanax
that you were looking for...

01:01:56.766 --> 01:01:58.365
I didn't take it.

01:01:58.498 --> 01:02:00.496
Megan,
you already told me this.

01:02:00.629 --> 01:02:03.424
I found it
in the medicine cabinet

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.391
<i>after you moved out.</i>

01:02:05.524 --> 01:02:09.454
And I should have packed it up
with the rest of your things...

01:02:10.957 --> 01:02:12.415
<i>but I kept it.</i>

01:02:14.449 --> 01:02:17.145
I've just been feeling
anxious lately...

01:02:18.491 --> 01:02:22.220
and I felt safer knowing
that they were there.

01:02:22.491 --> 01:02:25.055
<i>You know,
in case I needed them.</i>

01:02:25.187 --> 01:02:27.053
Why are you telling me this?

01:02:27.185 --> 01:02:29.816
Because I'm tired of lying.

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.113
Anyway, I'll drop them off

01:02:34.149 --> 01:02:35.710
tomorrow morning
if you're there.

01:02:35.844 --> 01:02:39.140
<i>Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm glad you told me, okay?</i>

01:02:39.273 --> 01:02:42.737
- Me, too. Bye.
- Bye.

01:02:50.396 --> 01:02:52.627
<i>Going down.</i>

01:03:57.496 --> 01:04:01.791
This is Randy,
drop-off complete.

01:04:34.367 --> 01:04:36.532
Goddamn it.

01:04:44.357 --> 01:04:46.188
Hello?

01:04:59.509 --> 01:05:00.608
Hello?

01:05:54.556 --> 01:05:56.321
Whoa!

01:06:03.982 --> 01:06:05.237
Aah!

01:06:05.273 --> 01:06:06.439
Randy.

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:28.677
Randy?

01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:54.260
Oh, my God.

01:06:56.288 --> 01:06:57.554
Randy.

01:07:10.224 --> 01:07:11.424
Andrew.

01:07:11.557 --> 01:07:13.633
<i>Megan,
go to security right now.</i>

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.553
<i>The guy who broke into the
morgue killed the two officers</i>

01:07:15.686 --> 01:07:17.217
<i>transporting him
to the station.</i>

01:07:17.253 --> 01:07:18.389
<i>We have an APB out on him,</i>

01:07:18.425 --> 01:07:19.616
<i>but there's a chance
he could make...</i>

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.711
- Move.
- <i>Megan?</i>

01:07:23.844 --> 01:07:25.376
<i>Megan?</i>

01:07:31.303 --> 01:07:32.835
Open it.

01:07:37.598 --> 01:07:38.796
Get the lift.

01:07:54.364 --> 01:07:57.428
Do you see
what's happening to her body?

01:07:57.561 --> 01:07:58.906
She's healing.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:01.424
She heals herself
by killing people

01:08:01.557 --> 01:08:02.980
and then she rests.

01:08:04.127 --> 01:08:05.785
Why hasn't she killed you?

01:08:06.918 --> 01:08:08.783
I don't know.

01:08:10.814 --> 01:08:12.312
I believe you.

01:08:29.194 --> 01:08:33.691
There's something evil
hiding inside.

01:08:33.823 --> 01:08:36.122
The church...

01:08:36.255 --> 01:08:38.185
said to walk away...

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:41.683
but I couldn't give up
on my only child.

01:08:41.866 --> 01:08:44.296
That's your daughter?

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.328
Not anymore.

01:08:47.694 --> 01:08:50.191
Hannah struggled
with depression...

01:08:50.323 --> 01:08:51.723
anxiety.

01:08:53.156 --> 01:08:54.720
It worked on her...

01:08:54.853 --> 01:08:58.183
day after day...

01:08:58.316 --> 01:09:00.348
till it broke her...

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:04.111
...found its way
inside her body.

01:09:04.243 --> 01:09:06.308
Is that when her eye changed?

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.073
Yeah.

01:09:08.206 --> 01:09:10.270
That's the demon's mark.

01:09:11.836 --> 01:09:15.932
No matter how many exorcisms
they performed, it stayed.

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:19.194
One last...

01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:21.725
...attempt.

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:25.920
In the name of God,
in the name of Jesus Christ...

01:09:25.956 --> 01:09:27.625
our Lord, be gone!

01:09:28.553 --> 01:09:30.618
You have to understand...

01:09:32.515 --> 01:09:34.581
...I did what I did...

01:09:36.145 --> 01:09:37.720
...to save the lives
of others.

01:09:44.437 --> 01:09:47.634
But the demon
was too powerful.

01:09:48.799 --> 01:09:50.331
<i>It stayed.</i>

01:09:52.096 --> 01:09:54.427
The next day,
when we went to bury her...

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:59.086
...her body, it disappeared
from the mortuary.

01:10:05.391 --> 01:10:07.133
<i>Four people were dead.</i>

01:10:10.211 --> 01:10:11.976
We have to get her
to the incinerator.

01:10:15.239 --> 01:10:16.842
The knife wasn't enough.

01:10:16.878 --> 01:10:20.568
The only way to destroy
this thing is to burn her.

01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:23.398
Anything else
just slows her down.

01:10:45.576 --> 01:10:46.841
No!

01:10:53.506 --> 01:10:54.604
Come and get me!

01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:00.491
No! Stop!

01:11:00.539 --> 01:11:02.192
No!

01:11:02.326 --> 01:11:03.492
Stop!

01:11:07.154 --> 01:11:08.919
No!

01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:25.294
Come on. Come on.

01:11:25.428 --> 01:11:27.392
Come on.

01:11:27.526 --> 01:11:28.758
Come on.

01:11:28.891 --> 01:11:29.990
Come on!

01:11:45.441 --> 01:11:46.773
<i>Mezzanine.</i>

01:11:46.906 --> 01:11:47.872
No.

01:11:52.139 --> 01:11:53.438
<i>Going up.</i>

01:12:00.218 --> 01:12:02.682
<i>Arrived at mezzanine.</i>

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:37.110
Officer Kurtz,
reporting a 10-65.

01:12:37.146 --> 01:12:39.080
I need backup
at Boston Metro Hospital,

01:12:39.245 --> 01:12:41.078
possible homicide.

01:13:31.598 --> 01:13:34.328
<i>Arrived at morgue.</i>

01:13:37.535 --> 01:13:38.734
Megan?

01:14:18.679 --> 01:14:20.311
Megan?

01:14:27.837 --> 01:14:29.369
Megan?

01:14:57.865 --> 01:14:59.497
Oh, my God.

01:14:59.631 --> 01:15:01.228
Oh, my God.

01:15:05.924 --> 01:15:07.689
Oh, God.

01:15:09.287 --> 01:15:10.786
Oh, God.

01:15:20.309 --> 01:15:21.375
Fuck.

01:15:21.509 --> 01:15:23.773
- Who's there?
- It's Officer Kurtz.

01:15:25.538 --> 01:15:28.635
- Megan's friend. Where is she?
- Yeah, I don't know.

01:15:28.768 --> 01:15:30.433
Dave's missing, too.

01:15:30.566 --> 01:15:33.463
Everything's down.
What's going on down here?

01:15:40.722 --> 01:15:42.321
Oh, God.

01:15:57.573 --> 01:16:00.167
- Megan.
- Andrew. Oh, my God.

01:16:00.203 --> 01:16:02.501
- What happened?
- We have to get out of here.

01:16:02.634 --> 01:16:04.898
What the hell is that?

01:16:09.693 --> 01:16:11.225
Come on.

01:16:12.558 --> 01:16:15.421
- What?
- Oh, my God. Come on! Come on!

01:16:16.686 --> 01:16:18.485
Hey!

01:16:18.718 --> 01:16:20.249
<i>Going down.</i>

01:16:20.383 --> 01:16:21.615

01:16:24.679 --> 01:16:26.277
Hey, stop!

01:16:35.601 --> 01:16:37.533
Hannah, no.

01:16:42.794 --> 01:16:43.793
No!

01:16:43.926 --> 01:16:45.358
Let him go!

01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:49.887
Megan.

01:16:58.612 --> 01:16:59.644
Megan.

01:17:26.894 --> 01:17:28.875
Andrew. Are you okay?

01:17:30.482 --> 01:17:33.945
Okay, come on. Hurry.
We don't have much time.

01:18:00.216 --> 01:18:04.046
- Go get help.
- Wait. What? Megan.

01:18:43.773 --> 01:18:47.269
No! Help me, please!

01:20:25.604 --> 01:20:28.502
<i>I'm 62 days clean...</i>

01:20:32.331 --> 01:20:36.193
