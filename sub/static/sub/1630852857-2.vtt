00:06.083 --> 00:08.791
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.416 --> 00:15.250
Well, I gave the students
an exercise to do in class.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.125
An autobiographical story.

00:17.208 --> 00:20.083
I asked them to tell me
about an important time in their lives.

00:20.166 --> 00:22.291
It was a difficult exercise for me.

00:22.375 --> 00:26.166
I like making up stories
but not talking about myself.

00:29.208 --> 00:31.708
The girl was having trouble.
She was upset.

00:31.791 --> 00:33.166
I was quite worked up.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.083
Suddenly, I couldn't take it anymore,

00:37.166 --> 00:40.333
so I left the classroom
and went to the bathroom.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.833
She seemed upset.

00:43.625 --> 00:46.083
I wanted to make sure
it wasn't anything serious.

00:46.791 --> 00:47.875
Then what happened?

00:48.666 --> 00:50.916
He came into the bathroom shortly after.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.125
I went in and asked her
how she was, if she was okay.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.375
And then?

00:58.041 --> 00:59.958
I leaned against the sink.

01:02.583 --> 01:05.291
I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't calm myself down.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.666
The girl who saw you together

01:08.541 --> 01:10.083
said you were very close.

01:10.750 --> 01:11.875
Hugging.

01:11.958 --> 01:12.833
No.

01:12.916 --> 01:14.583
No, we were not hugging.

01:14.666 --> 01:16.166
I almost fainted.

01:16.916 --> 01:19.250
So yes, the professor held me up.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.583
When I approached,

01:20.666 --> 01:23.416
she closed her eyes and fell into my arms.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.500
That's all.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.333
It's different. It's not being hugged.

01:30.041 --> 01:33.625
Do you have anything to report
about Professor Pentecoste's behavior?

01:33.708 --> 01:35.041
What do you mean?

01:35.125 --> 01:38.333
Has he ever shown
any special interest in you?

01:38.833 --> 01:39.708
No.

01:42.875 --> 01:45.541
You've never seen the girl
outside the university?

01:45.625 --> 01:46.458
No.

01:47.125 --> 01:50.208
Except for our individual meetings,
as per the program.

01:50.708 --> 01:52.541
He only encouraged me to write.

01:53.166 --> 01:55.916
We have a good relationship.
He's a great teacher.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.166
The university's reputation is at stake.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.666
As is yours, of course.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.750
That's why it's important
to clear everything up.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.541
-Nothing happened in the restroom.
-I wanted to help her.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.541
Whatever they said.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.000
-It was just a misunderstanding.
-A misunderstanding.

02:40.750 --> 02:41.583
Hi.

02:42.083 --> 02:42.916
Hey!

02:43.416 --> 02:46.458
What's happened?
Are we celebrating something?

02:46.541 --> 02:48.458
No, I had some free time.

02:48.541 --> 02:50.916
And you decided to cook?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.458
I do every now and then.

02:53.958 --> 02:56.208
Something extremely smoky?

02:56.291 --> 02:57.125
No.

02:57.666 --> 02:58.583
Why?

02:59.666 --> 03:00.958
Fuck, the zucchini!

03:02.333 --> 03:03.750
-No!
-What?

03:04.958 --> 03:06.833
No, go sit down.

03:09.958 --> 03:10.958
It doesn't matter.

03:12.708 --> 03:16.666
So it's couscous with mint,
salmon, and cherry tomatoes.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.250
There were zucchini too,

03:19.333 --> 03:21.041
but they didn't make it.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.208
Looks good.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.000
Taste it and let me know.

03:25.916 --> 03:27.041
Be honest, huh?

03:30.750 --> 03:32.625
-You don't like it?
-It's good.

03:32.708 --> 03:33.791
It's exotic.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.416
You clearly don't like it.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.375
-No!
-You're a terrible liar.

03:39.875 --> 03:40.750
Listen…

03:42.500 --> 03:44.041
I have to tell you something.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.125
Me too.

03:48.083 --> 03:48.916
Tell me.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.791
-Something happened at the university.
-What?

03:54.833 --> 03:58.083
A girl wasn't feeling well
during an exercise in class.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.291
She had some kind of panic attack.

04:02.041 --> 04:05.125
I was in the corridor.
I saw her go into the restroom.

04:05.208 --> 04:08.791
I followed her
to see how she was, to help her.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.625
And she practically fainted into my arms.

04:15.583 --> 04:16.416
And?

04:16.916 --> 04:19.166
And nothing. I held her up.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.958
But a girl saw us together
and misunderstood.

04:22.791 --> 04:23.791
What do you mean?

04:24.291 --> 04:25.125
I don't know.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.583
I don't know what she thought.

04:27.666 --> 04:28.875
We were very close.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.833
-When did this happen?
-Yesterday.

04:33.291 --> 04:34.583
And you didn't tell me?

04:36.666 --> 04:38.125
I didn't think it was important.

04:38.208 --> 04:41.625
But this morning,
the dean called me into his office, so…

04:44.125 --> 04:45.333
But how close?

04:46.291 --> 04:47.500
Darling, she fainted.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.625
She was ill. She fainted.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.000
-What should I have done?
-Nothing.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.708
-You don't believe me?
-I do.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.333
Of course!

05:00.458 --> 05:02.000
What did the dean say?

05:03.125 --> 05:05.125
-Did he believe you?
-Yes.

05:06.416 --> 05:08.125
-Will it cause problems?
-No.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.083
No, I told you. We cleared it all up.

05:12.041 --> 05:12.875
Okay.

05:13.541 --> 05:14.500
And you?

05:15.458 --> 05:17.125
What did you want to tell me?

05:18.458 --> 05:19.833
No, nothing. Just that…

05:21.375 --> 05:24.291
I might be about to close a new sale.

05:26.666 --> 05:27.708
Good.

05:27.791 --> 05:28.625
Yeah.

05:29.708 --> 05:30.541
Good.

05:54.583 --> 05:55.750
Are you happy?

06:01.666 --> 06:03.083
What kind of question is that?

06:05.208 --> 06:06.666
Of course I'm happy.

06:10.916 --> 06:12.583
What's that girl's name?

06:14.791 --> 06:15.750
Are you jealous?

06:18.875 --> 06:20.541
Her name is Sofia.

06:22.166 --> 06:23.125
Sofia Casadei.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.375
And you two talk?

06:26.375 --> 06:28.583
-Please, Marghe.
-Are you friendly with her?

06:34.875 --> 06:36.958
Darling, nothing happened.

06:37.583 --> 06:38.458
Okay?

06:39.708 --> 06:42.458
I just felt like
I had to help her. That's all.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.208
Really?

06:53.333 --> 06:55.041
So what did you do? Did you…

06:57.833 --> 07:00.000
Did you comfort her, huh?

07:01.750 --> 07:03.416
-Well…
-Professor.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.333
She seems like a very delicate girl.

07:11.625 --> 07:12.875
I'm delicate too.

07:15.458 --> 07:16.625
Very delicate.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.625
SOFIA CASADEI
STUDENT NO. 133521

08:28.208 --> 08:29.791
<i>"I thought I knew you.</i>"

08:30.708 --> 08:32.666
<i>"I knew your sadness."</i>

08:32.750 --> 08:33.958
<i>"Your dark days."</i>

08:35.166 --> 08:39.333
<i>"In your eyes, I could see</i>
<i>the dreams that imprisoned your soul."</i>

08:40.500 --> 08:42.208
<i>"But that day, you were smiling."</i>

08:42.291 --> 08:44.958
<i>"We played together.</i>
<i>We listened to a song."</i>

08:45.708 --> 08:46.875
<i>"You took me with you."</i>

08:47.375 --> 08:49.958
<i>"You wanted to take me</i>
<i>to where your love was born."</i>

08:51.375 --> 08:53.958
<i>"I couldn't have known</i>
<i>where you'd really take me."</i>

09:17.833 --> 09:19.833
I don't know how that could've happened.

09:20.708 --> 09:21.750
Unbelievable!

09:22.708 --> 09:24.666
Obviously, we didn't remove it.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.083
No. Look.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.541
But of course!
Of course the house is still for sale.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.916
Listen, madam. Here's what we'll do.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.125
I'll fix this and call you back
as soon as possible. Okay?

09:36.208 --> 09:37.500
Thank you.

09:37.583 --> 09:38.666
Goodbye.

09:39.916 --> 09:42.625
-The Concordia owner.
-Mrs. Di Benedetto?

09:42.708 --> 09:45.625
-Someone took the sign off the building.
-Come on!

09:45.708 --> 09:47.916
Okay, come on. Let's sort this out.

09:50.583 --> 09:53.541
How about you, honey?
How are you? Everything okay?

09:53.625 --> 09:56.416
-Yes, I have a bit of a headache today.
-Nausea?

09:56.500 --> 09:58.333
-A little.
-Swollen legs?

09:59.416 --> 10:01.250
Come on, Eva! Don't be a pain!

10:01.791 --> 10:03.125
I'm not pregnant.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.958
If it means that much to you,
you have this baby.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.291
No way!

10:07.375 --> 10:09.500
Listen, I'll take care of the sign.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.666
-Really? Thanks, honey.
-Sure.

10:11.750 --> 10:14.291
What happened to that couple
who wanted to buy it?

10:14.375 --> 10:16.291
They changed their minds.

10:16.375 --> 10:17.750
Shame. It seemed done.

10:17.833 --> 10:18.958
Indeed.

10:19.041 --> 10:21.416
-So you'll sort it?
-Yes.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.333
Thank you.

10:22.958 --> 10:24.166
-Bye.
-Bye.

10:31.583 --> 10:32.416
Hi.

10:32.916 --> 10:33.750
Hey!

11:36.916 --> 11:41.208
SOFIA - HI CARLO,
I'M WRITING. I NEED YOUR HELP.

11:41.291 --> 11:45.791
WHEN CAN WE MEET?

12:13.583 --> 12:14.916
-Hi.
-Hi, darling.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.166
How's it going?

12:25.041 --> 12:25.875
So-so.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.041
I haven't cooked yet. I'm sorry.

12:28.125 --> 12:31.250
Today is one of those days
when I can't get anything done.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.083
Don't worry.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.458
Come on, Hemingway.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.750
Get ready. I'm taking you out.

13:18.833 --> 13:19.791
Okay.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.166
Wow!

13:28.250 --> 13:30.625
He's a chatterbox. He talks and talks.

13:30.708 --> 13:33.083
Shut up, Luca! Shut the fuck up!

13:33.166 --> 13:35.208
Sorry, you could invite him
to the symposium.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.666
-No. Come on.
-He's the perfect guest.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.583
-A Negroni?
-Thanks, that's for me.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.708
Now I'll make a toast.

13:41.791 --> 13:44.083
This is the third round, so it's my turn.

13:44.708 --> 13:46.000
What are we toasting to?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.291
We are toasting

13:49.166 --> 13:50.375
to the perfect murder.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.375
Really?

13:53.000 --> 13:53.916
Who died?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.166
No one yet.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.458
What have you done?

14:00.875 --> 14:02.375
I took it off the market.

14:02.458 --> 14:03.416
Concordia?

14:04.208 --> 14:06.666
I didn't sell it to that couple,
and I removed the ad.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.833
Does the owner know?

14:08.916 --> 14:09.791
-No.
-No?

14:11.916 --> 14:13.333
I know. It's crazy.

14:13.416 --> 14:14.833
So what's the plan now?

14:14.916 --> 14:16.458
Well, now the plan is

14:16.541 --> 14:18.916
to convince the owner
the price is too high

14:19.000 --> 14:21.291
and the apartment will never sell,

14:21.375 --> 14:23.833
and wait for it to get lower,

14:23.916 --> 14:26.333
and, at the right time, make our offer.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.333
You're diabolical, you know that?

14:30.416 --> 14:31.791
-You think?
-Yes.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.791
You're such a bad girl, very bad.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.166
We're going home right now
to sort this out.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.583
Why at home?

15:35.041 --> 15:36.291
Who is it? Oh, sorry!

15:36.375 --> 15:38.250
Oh fuck! No!

15:40.000 --> 15:40.958
It was…

15:41.041 --> 15:42.041
It was open!

15:42.541 --> 15:44.333
I don't believe it!

15:45.000 --> 15:49.125
Does a restroom without a lock
seem normal in a place like this? Come on!

15:49.208 --> 15:52.166
-Did you see his face?
-Yes, I did see it.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.958
I did tell you to go home though.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.041
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.250
Are you saying you didn't like my idea?

16:00.333 --> 16:02.416
-No, it was a lot of fun.
-Yeah?

16:02.500 --> 16:03.625
Yes, but…

16:03.708 --> 16:05.333
Honey, I'm driving.

16:05.416 --> 16:08.458
The last thing we need
is to get stopped by the police.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.250
-Answer!
-What does she want at this time?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.375
SOFIA CASADEI
ACCEPT, DECLINE

16:19.458 --> 16:20.375
Answer!

16:22.208 --> 16:24.958
Hello, Sofia?
How are you? Everything okay?

16:25.041 --> 16:27.958
<i>Yes, I don't know.</i>
<i>I wanted to talk to you.</i>

16:28.458 --> 16:29.500
Talk to me?

16:31.250 --> 16:33.250
<i>I sent you a message. Did you see it?</i>

16:33.875 --> 16:37.708
No, I haven't seen it.
It's late, Sofia. It's almost midnight.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.708
I'm in the car with my wife.
You're on speakerphone.

16:41.541 --> 16:44.541
<i>Sorry. I didn't realize it was so late.</i>

16:44.625 --> 16:47.333
I'll see you tomorrow,
and you can tell me everything. Okay?

16:48.458 --> 16:49.500
<i>Okay. Good night.</i>

16:49.583 --> 16:50.541
Good night.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.333
Stop the car.

16:59.416 --> 17:01.500
-We're almost there.
-I said stop the car!

17:05.750 --> 17:08.500
Where are you going? Marghe? Where…

17:09.375 --> 17:10.250
Fuck!

17:21.000 --> 17:22.625
What are you doing? You smoke now?

17:22.708 --> 17:24.125
Leave me alone, Carlo.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.000
Darling, please.

17:27.625 --> 17:31.625
I know that bothered you,
but don't blow it out of proportion.

17:31.708 --> 17:35.000
"Blow it out of proportion"?
That's normal to you? Nothing happened?

17:35.083 --> 17:36.958
She calls at midnight, and that's normal?

17:37.041 --> 17:38.625
-You heard the call.
-Yes, I did.

17:38.708 --> 17:40.666
So you saw I have nothing to hide!

17:40.750 --> 17:43.000
-You told her she was on speaker.
-And?

17:43.083 --> 17:45.958
That's not what someone
with nothing to hide does!

17:46.041 --> 17:47.958
I wanted to point out that it's late,

17:48.041 --> 17:50.500
that I'm married
and she can't just call whenever!

17:50.583 --> 17:51.666
What a guy!

17:52.166 --> 17:54.916
I can't believe
we're arguing over this shit.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.833
She's 20, Margherita.
To her, it's normal to call at this time.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.166
-Yeah? How do you know?
-Yeah.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.541
I don't know. I imagine so.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.875
You talk so much shit.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.708
-Let's go.
-Are you in contact outside of class?

18:09.791 --> 18:10.708
No, we aren't. No.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.958
She writes to you,
sends you messages, and calls

18:13.041 --> 18:14.625
-Enough, please!
-Are you seeing her?

18:14.708 --> 18:16.125
-No!
-You have to tell me.

18:16.208 --> 18:18.750
We're drunk. We drank too much.

18:19.625 --> 18:22.500
It's cold. Look, you're shivering.
Please, let's go home.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.416
I'm going to bed.

19:05.125 --> 19:07.666
-Are you coming?
-What happened in that restroom?

19:08.250 --> 19:09.291
Nothing.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.041
-Did you fuck?
-Marghe.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.125
-Tell me.
-Marghe, no.

19:13.208 --> 19:14.583
We didn't fuck.

19:15.666 --> 19:17.833
I told you the truth. What else can I do?

19:18.833 --> 19:20.958
How can I prove nothing happened?

19:22.041 --> 19:23.500
You're right. You can't.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.333
All right, I'm off.

19:47.416 --> 19:48.583
You aren't going out?

19:48.666 --> 19:51.291
I'll drop by the agency later.
I have a viewing at ten.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.541
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

20:40.458 --> 20:43.166
UCM - UNIVERSITY
FOR THE CREATIVE ARTS MILAN

20:52.333 --> 20:55.375
Only ten minutes!
I'll see you back here shortly.

20:57.666 --> 20:58.666
Sofia.

21:08.666 --> 21:10.000
Sorry about yesterday.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.250
I needed your advice.
I could've waited for today.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.333
I'm not so good at waiting.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.833
You just need to believe in yourself more.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.166
You don't need any other tips.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.375
I want them from you.

21:36.208 --> 21:38.750
I don't want things to change between us.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.875
I'm here for you, now and then.

22:18.750 --> 22:21.291
But you have to learn
to walk on your own two feet.

22:22.666 --> 22:23.500
Okay.

22:43.583 --> 22:44.666
-Hey!
-Hey.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.291
Everything okay?

22:47.083 --> 22:47.916
Yes.

22:48.416 --> 22:49.416
Why are you here?

22:50.083 --> 22:51.666
You have to be more careful.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.541
Antihistamines.

22:57.708 --> 22:59.083
You always forget them.

23:00.208 --> 23:01.166
You're right.

23:02.083 --> 23:03.333
Good thing you're here.

23:08.541 --> 23:10.458
-See you tonight.
-Okay.

23:54.541 --> 23:55.416
How are you?

23:56.916 --> 23:57.833
Bad today.

23:59.333 --> 24:00.375
Worse than usual.

24:01.958 --> 24:02.916
Turn over.

24:32.875 --> 24:35.500
Will massaging my back
stop my leg from hurting?

24:37.541 --> 24:39.583
You don't trust anyone, do you?

24:48.916 --> 24:50.333
Stop thinking.

24:52.583 --> 24:53.500
Can you do that?

24:54.958 --> 24:55.833
No.

24:57.625 --> 24:58.791
I can't do it.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.208
I'm not able to.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.208
Yes, you are.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.708
What have you found?

25:28.875 --> 25:30.500
Oh, <i>Portraits of a Marriage.</i>

25:31.041 --> 25:32.083
Yours or Franco's?

25:32.166 --> 25:34.041
Franco's? Come on.

25:34.125 --> 25:37.833
If it's not a comic book,
he wouldn't waste a minute on it.

25:38.375 --> 25:40.916
Márai is my great love.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.041
"Most people don't know
how to love or let themselves be loved

25:45.125 --> 25:49.250
because they're either cowards or proud,
or because they're afraid of failure."

25:49.916 --> 25:51.500
What a book. Wonderful.

25:53.041 --> 25:55.416
-Can I ask you a question, Anna?
-Sure.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.250
Did you and Franco
tell each other everything?

25:59.958 --> 26:01.291
Only the best stuff.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.541
What do you want to tell me?

26:09.041 --> 26:10.916
I've never noticed that stain.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.250
Yeah, it's been there for a while.

26:13.333 --> 26:14.916
I called the painter.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.583
I'll have to empty the study,
pack up the boxes.

26:17.666 --> 26:19.458
-I can give you a hand.
-No.

26:19.541 --> 26:21.291
Don't worry. I'll do it by myself.

26:21.375 --> 26:22.625
Listen, Carlo.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.541
I won't be here next Thursday.

26:25.125 --> 26:25.958
Okay.

26:26.041 --> 26:27.583
See you the Thursday after?

26:28.208 --> 26:31.208
Then we can talk about
what you don't want to tell me today.

26:31.291 --> 26:32.916
I have nothing to tell you.

26:34.916 --> 26:35.958
Can I borrow it?

26:36.041 --> 26:36.875
Sure.

26:37.458 --> 26:39.583
But don't let Margherita find out.

26:39.666 --> 26:43.000
Having that book in the house
causes arguments.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.708
Thank you.

26:52.958 --> 26:54.291
There she is!

26:56.625 --> 26:58.250
-Hi!
-You're a knockout!

26:58.333 --> 27:01.208
-Darling! Everything's amazing, really.
-Thanks.

27:01.291 --> 27:03.708
-I'm so proud of you!
-Thank you.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.583
I can't seem to relax.

27:05.666 --> 27:08.500
You have to relax.
I've heard nothing but good comments.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.500
-He's a genius, isn't he?
-Yeah.

27:11.083 --> 27:13.416
To think he did it all
with a ballpoint pen.

27:13.500 --> 27:16.083
-The whole sketch--
-Giulia, excuse me. Achille's here.

27:16.583 --> 27:18.416
-Hi, Margherita.
-Hi, Alice.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.583
See you later.

27:20.541 --> 27:22.458
-What did he say?
-Nothing.

27:29.041 --> 27:30.791
-She looks like you.
-Pardon?

27:31.583 --> 27:33.208
The woman in the painting.

27:35.625 --> 27:36.500
You think?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
He's holding her in his arms,

27:39.625 --> 27:41.291
but she's looking elsewhere.

27:41.958 --> 27:42.916
A bit like you.

27:43.541 --> 27:46.625
You're here, among all these people,
but you seem…

27:49.083 --> 27:50.000
so far away.

27:50.750 --> 27:51.708
Marcello.

27:53.958 --> 27:54.916
Margherita.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.458
What do you do, Margherita?

27:58.625 --> 28:00.166
I'm a real estate agent.

28:01.666 --> 28:02.500
But?

28:04.833 --> 28:05.666
"But"?

28:06.333 --> 28:09.083
You're looking like her again.
Looking elsewhere.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.791
Actually, I'm an architect, and I want…

28:15.000 --> 28:16.750
I wanted to be a decorator.

28:17.375 --> 28:18.625
So what stopped you?

28:20.416 --> 28:21.833
Life's about choices.

28:23.750 --> 28:26.833
-I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.
-You didn't.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.666
Are you here alone?

28:30.708 --> 28:31.791
Actually, no.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.083
Is that your boyfriend?

28:38.625 --> 28:39.666
Husband.

28:41.458 --> 28:42.541
What about you?

28:43.208 --> 28:44.333
What do you do?

28:44.833 --> 28:47.375
Have your dreams come true?

28:49.166 --> 28:50.166
I don't know.

28:50.666 --> 28:51.666
Margherita.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.833
This is our artist.

28:54.708 --> 28:55.625
Oh, well,

28:56.541 --> 28:57.500
congratulations!

28:58.083 --> 29:00.833
Excuse me, Marcello.
I need to introduce you to someone.

29:03.250 --> 29:06.375
It was really nice
to meet you, Margherita.

29:30.791 --> 29:34.500
Do you realize the shit I had to read?
Shall I show you line by line?

29:34.583 --> 29:36.125
You stole my phone!

29:36.208 --> 29:38.791
I took it by mistake.
We have the same phone!

29:38.875 --> 29:41.333
Yes, but you didn't have to spy on me.

29:41.416 --> 29:44.041
What the fuck?
You didn't have to fuck that guy!

29:44.125 --> 29:46.041
-Marco, enough.
-Enough, my ass!

29:46.125 --> 29:47.708
-Tell me where--
-Lower your voice!

29:47.791 --> 29:50.166
-Why did you do it?
-'Cause you're stuck, Marco.

29:50.250 --> 29:53.625
We're stuck. We had plans.
We aren't going anywhere!

29:56.500 --> 29:58.125
You're a bitch, you know?

30:00.125 --> 30:00.958
Yes.

30:02.250 --> 30:03.291
But I'm right.

30:05.416 --> 30:06.541
I have to go now.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.083
Insane.

30:17.583 --> 30:18.583
Yes, it is insane.

30:21.958 --> 30:23.416
From the Maldives to divorce.

30:24.333 --> 30:25.875
Nice change of plans.

30:26.458 --> 30:30.125
Stop it, Carlo. How can you joke about it?
I'm really shocked.

30:31.291 --> 30:34.416
And how did she manage
to hide it all for six months?

30:35.208 --> 30:36.625
She didn't say a word,

30:36.708 --> 30:38.458
and I didn't notice anything.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.916
Why'd you come to the university?

30:52.750 --> 30:55.291
What can I do to put your mind at ease?

30:59.333 --> 31:00.250
I don't know.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.208
Dad?

31:41.291 --> 31:43.000
<i>Hi, honey! Where are you?</i>

31:43.625 --> 31:44.750
I can't hear you!

31:45.500 --> 31:46.500
<i>How are you?</i>

31:47.166 --> 31:48.208
Good.

31:48.750 --> 31:49.750
<i>Are you sure?</i>

31:51.125 --> 31:53.666
Yes, what do I have to do,
sing you a song?

31:54.166 --> 31:55.166
<i>Why not?</i>

31:57.041 --> 31:58.291
No, it's nothing.

31:58.958 --> 32:02.500
It's just some school stuff.
I have to do an assignment, but I can't.

32:02.583 --> 32:04.916
<i>See? There was something wrong!</i>

32:05.875 --> 32:07.458
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

32:08.125 --> 32:09.250
As soon as I can.

32:09.916 --> 32:12.625
<i>Want me to send you</i>
<i>a piadina with squacquerone?</i>

32:12.708 --> 32:13.541
I wish!

32:13.625 --> 32:16.333
<i>That's more like it! Don't make me worry.</i>

32:16.416 --> 32:18.416
<i>And remember, when something is hard,</i>

32:18.500 --> 32:21.083
<i>that's a good sign</i>
<i>because it means you like it.</i>

32:29.708 --> 32:30.583
<i>Hey?</i>

32:32.041 --> 32:33.375
<i>Sofia, are you there?</i>

32:35.375 --> 32:37.708
Yes, Dad. I'll come home soon. Bye.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.125
<i>Bye, darling. Bye.</i>

33:03.666 --> 33:05.625
Wow, you're early!

33:06.125 --> 33:08.416
Let's all get a ski pass.
It's snowing today.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.333
Yeah.

33:17.208 --> 33:19.041
-Good morning.
-Hello.

33:20.208 --> 33:21.541
May I? Are you closed?

33:21.625 --> 33:24.125
No, we just opened. Please take a seat.

33:24.208 --> 33:25.041
Thank you.

33:26.666 --> 33:29.208
What can I get you? A coffee?

33:29.291 --> 33:31.666
-A smoothie?
-A smoothie.

33:32.166 --> 33:34.958
Perfect. Apple, pineapple, and ginger?

33:35.041 --> 33:36.541
-Great.
-It won't be long.

33:36.625 --> 33:37.458
Thank you.

33:50.000 --> 33:50.916
Sofia?

33:52.541 --> 33:53.458
Yes.

33:53.541 --> 33:54.708
Have we met?

33:55.875 --> 33:57.041
You know who I am.

33:59.041 --> 34:00.166
How can I help you?

34:01.375 --> 34:03.708
I'd like to talk to you if you don't mind.

34:05.750 --> 34:06.583
Sure.

34:11.666 --> 34:12.791
I'd like your version.

34:13.291 --> 34:14.291
Of what?

34:16.833 --> 34:19.125
Of what happened
in the university restroom.

34:21.083 --> 34:22.458
There isn't a "my" version.

34:22.541 --> 34:24.833
It's just like the professor said.

34:25.541 --> 34:28.375
I didn't feel well.
I went to the restroom, and he helped me.

34:28.958 --> 34:29.791
And then?

34:30.458 --> 34:32.666
And then nothing.
Someone saw us and misunderstood.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.833
There's nothing to misunderstand?

34:34.916 --> 34:36.250
Is this an interrogation?

34:37.916 --> 34:38.833
I'm sorry.

34:39.416 --> 34:42.250
You're right.
It does seem like an interrogation.

34:44.125 --> 34:47.041
It's just that Carlo and I
have been together for years.

34:47.666 --> 34:51.125
We have plans for the future,
and I need to know the truth.

34:51.208 --> 34:53.458
I've said all I have to say.

34:56.333 --> 34:59.125
All that you have to say
or all that you wanted to?

34:59.750 --> 35:01.750
In this case, there's no difference.

35:03.583 --> 35:06.416
What did you want
when you called my husband at midnight?

35:06.916 --> 35:08.500
I didn't realize it was so late.

35:08.583 --> 35:11.125
I was writing the assignment,

35:11.208 --> 35:12.916
the story he assigned to us.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.416
The autobiographical story?

35:16.291 --> 35:17.125
Yes.

35:18.375 --> 35:19.666
I wanted his help.

35:21.916 --> 35:23.916
Well, Carlo says you're talented.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.833
That you're just a bit blocked.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.000
Persevere.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.041
I'll let you go now, promise.

35:36.125 --> 35:37.916
I'd just like to ask one more question.

35:40.708 --> 35:42.500
Does he have feelings for you?

35:46.791 --> 35:47.625
No.

35:49.833 --> 35:52.166
I think he already has
everything he wants.

35:55.708 --> 35:56.541
Thank you.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.666
And I'm sorry…

36:40.166 --> 36:42.250
-Excuse me?
-Yes, tell me.

36:42.333 --> 36:45.083
I can't remember, where's Sofia Casadei…

36:45.166 --> 36:47.833
Yes, look. There are two girls.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.625
First balcony, third door.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.541
-Perfect. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.041
-Hello.
-Hello.

37:18.125 --> 37:20.916
I'm the real estate agent
for the property valuation.

37:21.750 --> 37:23.250
-May I?
-Please.

37:27.125 --> 37:28.750
The owner didn't tell me.

37:30.458 --> 37:31.583
He must've forgotten.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.583
Is he selling the apartment?

37:33.666 --> 37:35.791
No, it's just a presale valuation.

37:36.416 --> 37:39.500
I need to take some measurements.
It will take a few minutes.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.375
Actually, I was studying.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.083
I'm sorry to disturb you.

37:43.791 --> 37:45.250
Is that your room?

37:45.333 --> 37:47.208
No, it's my roommate's.

37:47.291 --> 37:50.000
I'll start there, then,
so I won't disturb you.

38:07.916 --> 38:09.833
Two coffees, honey. Thanks.

38:39.541 --> 38:40.875
THE WRITING OF TIME

39:10.166 --> 39:12.250
Hi, Carlo. I wanted to
let you know I'm leaving.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.458
-Hi, Pentecoste.
-Mario.

39:14.541 --> 39:16.416
-Have you got five minutes?
-Yeah.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.666
Listen…

39:22.041 --> 39:23.666
-A workshop.
-Yes.

39:23.750 --> 39:26.250
And put together our material.

39:33.958 --> 39:35.541
-I'm counting on it.
-Okay.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.083
-Shall we?
-Yes. I'll be there now.

39:49.666 --> 39:51.833
<i>Hi, Carlo. I wanted to</i>
<i>let you know I'm leaving.</i>

39:52.875 --> 39:56.208
<i>I'm leaving the course, going home.</i>
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

39:56.875 --> 39:58.375
<i>Your wife came to speak to me.</i>

40:05.958 --> 40:10.833
