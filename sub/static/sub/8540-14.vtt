SHE LIVES ON TELEGRAPH AVENUE.KNOW WHAT HE'D BEEN UP TO
SINCE GETTING OUT?

04:16.647 --> 04:20.564
NO IDEA. HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM

04:20.651 --> 04:23.393
HE LEFT A COUPLE MESSAGES,
SAID HE NEEDED HELP.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.316
LIKE, THICKER?

05:16.403 --> 05:18.187
WHY?

05:18.274 --> 05:20.537
I'M THINKING JANE
WEIGHTED IT ON ONE SIDE

05:20.624 --> 05:22.844
SO THAT
IT ALWAYS LANDS HEADS.

05:22.931 --> 05:25.107
EXCEPT WHEN I FLIP IT,

05:25.194 --> 05:27.109
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
LAND HEADS.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.938
IT COMES UP TAILS
HALF THE TIME.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.462
MAYBE THERE'S
A TECHNIQUE OF TOSSING IT.

05:32.549 --> 05:35.509
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SEX
FROM VAN PELT.

05:35.596 --> 05:38.207

IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.349
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

05:49.436 --> 05:52.395
YOU NEVER VISITED HIM
IN PRISON, DID YOU?

05:52.482 --> 05:54.310
NO.

05:54.397 --> 05:58.793
12 YEARS IS A LONG TIME.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.230
I TOLD DAVID ABOUT YOU,

06:01.317 --> 06:04.059
WHEN YOU JOINED THE ARMY,

06:04.146 --> 06:05.887
WHEN YOU BECAME
A POLICE OFFICER.

06:05.974 --> 06:09.804
HE ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO YOU.

06:09.891 --> 06:14.025
YOU'LL BE WORKING TO FIND
WHO KILLED HIM, WON'T YOU?

06:14.112 --> 06:17.420
NO, MA'AM. THE CASE BELONGS
TO THE OAKLAND POLICE.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.117
THEY'LL FIND
WHOEVER DID THIS.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.815
THAT DETECTIVE WOMAN--

06:20.902 --> 06:24.079
SHE THINKS DAVID GOT KILLED
BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE GANG.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.777
THAT'S NOT TRUE.IT DOES LOOK LIKE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.780
NO. HE LEFT THE GANG.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.609
HE HAD A JOB.

06:32.696 --> 06:36.570
JUST BECAUSE HE TOLD YOU HE LEFT
THE GANG DOESN'T MEAN HE DID.HE WOULDN'T LIE TO ME.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.049
MRS. SEUNG,

06:38.136 --> 06:40.965
WHEN I KNEW DAVID,

06:41.052 --> 06:43.968
I HEARD HIM LIE TO YOU
MANY TIMES,

06:44.055 --> 06:47.537
ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING,
WHO HE WAS WITH.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.931
THE OAKLAND POLICE

06:50.018 --> 06:52.847
PLEASE, KIMBALL.

06:52.934 --> 06:56.067

06:56.154 --> 06:58.766
I'M SORRY, MRS. SEUNG.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.463
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

07:05.207 --> 07:08.166
SO HE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS?

07:08.253 --> 07:10.255
IT WAS
A GUY I USED TO KNOW.

07:10.342 --> 07:12.606
LOOK, WE'LL COVER FOR YOU

07:12.693 --> 07:15.260
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE COMP TIME
TO LOOK INTO IT.ABSOLUTELY.
BOSS WON'T MIND.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.871
I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED.

07:16.958 --> 07:20.483
BUT HE WAS YOUR FRIEND.

07:20.570 --> 07:23.007
HE WAS A GANGBANGER, VAN PELT.
BANGERS GET SHOT.

07:23.094 --> 07:26.837
ALL RIGHT, HE'S NOT THE FIRST
GUY I USED TO KNOW TO GET SHOT.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.318
HE WON'T BE THE LAST.THAT'S FUNNY.
GRANDMA OUT THERE

07:29.405 --> 07:33.235
SEEMED PRETTY CERTAIN
HE WAS NO LONGER A GANG MEMBER.SHE'S WRONG.

07:35.019 --> 07:38.545
SHE SEEMED PRETTY SHARP.MAYBE HE GOT SHOT 'CAUSE HE WAS
TRYING TO LEAVE THE GANG.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.068
THAT HAPPENS, DOESN'T IT?

07:40.155 --> 07:42.810
WHATEVER. OAKLAND'S GOT IT.

07:42.897 --> 07:46.117
HOW MUCH TIME IS OAKLAND P.D.
GONNA SPEND ON A GANGBANGER?

07:46.204 --> 07:48.250
NOT MUCH.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

07:48.337 --> 07:50.252
WELL, THERE MUST BE
SOMEONE THAT CAN TELL US

07:50.339 --> 07:52.776
THAT HE WAS OR WASN'T
A MEMBER OF THE GANG.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.083

YOU KNOW,
I READ SOMEWHERE THAT--

09:30.004 --> 09:32.441
AND THIS IS VERY INTERESTING--
THE AVERAGE DRUG DEALER

09:32.528 --> 09:35.575
WOULD MAKE A BETTER WAGE
SERVING BURGERS.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.882
IS THAT ACCURATE,
DO YOU THINK?

09:38.969 --> 09:40.884
[chuckles] THERE'S CHUMPS
AND THERE'S PLAYERS

09:40.971 --> 09:42.364

IS THAT WHAT GOT HIM
IN TROUBLE?WHY WOULD I TELL YOU ANYTHING?

10:05.822 --> 10:09.347
I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM
IT'S A GANG BEAND I'LL LEAVE IT ALONE.WHEN DAVID GOT OUT OF PRISON, WE
ASKED HIM TO PUT IN SOME WORK,

10:09.434 --> 10:12.220
GET HIM BACK IN THE GROOVE,
YOU KNOW? HE SAID NO.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.918
HE WAS QUITTING. HE QUIT.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.094
THEN ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
HE CALLS AND HE'S ALL,

10:17.181 --> 10:19.140
"I NEED TO TALK TO K.S.
DIRECT,"

10:19.227 --> 10:21.316
LIKE HE HAD
SOME KIND OF DEAL.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.840
SO HE'S WORKING WITH K.S.
AND NOT THE GANG?

10:23.927 --> 10:25.799
THAT'S WRONG.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.278
THAT'S DISRESPECT.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.064
YOU'RE IN OR YOU'RE OUT.

YOU KNOW,
YOUR OBSESSION WITH EATING

11:10.408 --> 11:12.672

THE "ICE MAN."

11:42.049 --> 11:44.965
Rigsby, what you got?WHEN DAVID SEUNG GOT OUT
OF PRISON, HE WENT TO WORK

11:45.052 --> 11:47.663
FOR A JANITORIAL SERVICES
COMPANY BASED IN OAKLAND.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.709
RIGSBY FOUND
WHERE DAVID WORKED.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.798
LISBON KNOW HE DID THAT?GOT AN ADDRESS?

11:51.885 --> 11:53.843
I'M WORKING ON IT.
IT'S JUST...

11:53.930 --> 11:55.627
What about
Seung's girlfriend?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.542
GIMME A HINT
ON THE COIN TRICK.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.414
Occam's razor.WHAT RAZOR?

11:59.501 --> 12:01.721
BYE.

12:01.808 --> 12:05.289
LET'S GO PAY A VISIT
TO DAVID'S OLD BOSS.WHAT'S THE POINT?
HE WAS A BANGER.

12:05.376 --> 12:08.118
SO HE HAD IT COMING?YES.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.730
LET'S GO AND SEE HIS BOSS,
GET A SECOND OPINION.

12:10.817 --> 12:14.734
AND WHO'S THIS "K.S.,"
BY THE WAY?HE'S A GANG LEADER, BAD GUY.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.388
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO MAKE HIM MAD?I SHOT HIM.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.303
[car door closes]

12:19.390 --> 12:24.047
THAT'LL DO IT.

12:24.134 --> 12:27.442
YEAH,
I SAW DAVID LAST NIGI WAS DROPPING OFF PAYROLL
WHEN HE WAS STARTING HIS SHIFT.DID DAVID EVER MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT THE AVON PARK PLAYBOYS?

12:27.529 --> 12:30.750
HIS P.O. GOT HIM THE INTERVIEW.
I KNEW ABOUT HIS PAST.

12:30.837 --> 12:34.188
WHY'D YOU HIRE HIM?I DON'T MIND HIRING EX-CONS.
THEY JUST NEED A SECOND CHANCE.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.190
WHEN THEY GET ONE,
THEY APPRECIATE IT.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.496
THEY'RE LOYAL.
IT KEEPS TURNOVER DOWN.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.369
[man] HEY, YOU.FRANK. CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING, MR. REED?

12:41.456 --> 12:42.849
YEAH, DO YOUR JOB.

12:42.936 --> 12:45.242
THE THIRD FLOOR MEN'S ROOM'S
A DISASTER.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.288
WHOLE FLOOR'S
STARTING TO STINK.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.029
MIDDLE MANAGEMENT.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.595
EXCUSE ME?

12:53.468 --> 12:55.383
YOU CATCH MORE FLIES
WITH HONEY--

12:55.470 --> 12:56.993
IT'S A SOUND
BUSINESS PRINCIPLE,

12:57.080 --> 12:59.561
OBVIOUSLY,
ONE YOU NEVER LEARNED.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.694
HENCE, UH, MIDDLE MANAGEMENT.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.480
[pops lips]

13:05.567 --> 13:07.482
HAVE A NICE DAY.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.527
HE'S GONE.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.138
I STARTED THIS BUSINESS

13:11.225 --> 13:13.662
THINKING IT'D BE NICE
NOT TO HAVE A BOSS.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.708
TRUTH IS, I HAVE DOZENS.DO YOU KNOW WHAT THESE MEAN?

13:19.233 --> 13:21.322
I HAVE NO IDEA.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.063
NO IDEA AT ALL?

13:23.150 --> 13:25.413
UH...

13:25.500 --> 13:26.936
NO.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.678
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO TELL YOU GUYS.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.507
NO NEED.THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.291
NO PROBLEM. GOOD LUCK.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.818
HEY, GUYS. I GOT A CALL
FROM DETECTIVE FLOREY

13:38.905 --> 13:40.471
WITH OAKLAND HOMICIDE.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.952
DID WE DECIDE TO TAKE OVER
THE DAVID SEUNG CASE

13:43.039 --> 13:45.868
AND NOBODY BOTHERED
TO TELL ME?

13:45.955 --> 13:48.828
BECAUSE SHE'S HEARING FROM
WITNESSES THAT YOU'VE TALKED TO.OH, UH, WE'RE JUST, UH.

13:48.915 --> 13:53.963
PURSUING A LITTLE
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.879
WE DON'T DO THOSE.THAT'S MY I WAS CHECKING TO SEE IF DAVID
WAS STILL WITH THE PLAYBOYS.BALLISTICS CONNECTED
THE GUN USED TO KILL
HIM

13:56.966 --> 13:58.925
WITH ANOTHER GANG SHOOTING
A YEAR AGO.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.840
IT WAS THE PLAYBOYS.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.407
GREAT.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.675
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SEE
THIS K.S. CHARACTER, HUH?

14:14.331 --> 14:15.637
OR NOT.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.773
SO I TOLD THE PROFESSOR
THAT THE EVIDENTIARY ISSUES

14:21.861 --> 14:24.820
WERE SECONDARY
TO THE PROCEDURAL QUESTION,

14:24.907 --> 14:27.301
AND SHE LOOKED AT ME
AND SAID,

14:27.388 --> 14:29.912
"HEY, YOUR HAIR'S ON FIRE."

14:29.999 --> 14:32.219
HELLO?

14:32.306 --> 14:35.265
SORRY. I HEARD THAT.

14:35.352 --> 14:38.181
HEARING ISN'T THE SAME
AS LISTENING.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.662
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:40.749 --> 14:43.621
YEAH. I'M FINE.

14:43.708 --> 14:47.712
KIMBALL, YOU'RE TALKING EVEN
LESS THAN YOU NORMALLY DO.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.671
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.586
NOTHING.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.762
WHICH MEANS SOMETHING,

14:53.849 --> 14:57.113
BUT YOU JUST DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

14:57.200 --> 14:58.506
RIGHT.

14:58.593 --> 15:01.161
WELL...

15:01.248 --> 15:02.902
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK.

15:05.426 --> 15:09.256
THANKS.

15:09.343 --> 15:12.999
[loud crash]ON THE FLOOR!
ON THE FLOOR!

15:13.086 --> 15:15.740
HEY, HEY, HEY! TAKE IT EASY!SHUT IT!

15:15.827 --> 15:17.829
HEY! GET DOWN! FACE DOWN![Elise] OH!

15:17.917 --> 15:20.963
[Cho] HEY, YOU STAY AWAY
FROM HER!STAY OUT OF PLAYBOY BUSINESS!

15:21.050 --> 15:23.052
[Elise grunting]

15:29.711 --> 15:32.583
[siren wails,
indistinct police radio chatter]

15:32.670 --> 15:35.456
SHE'S GOT SOME PRETTY BAD
BRUISING AND LACERATIONS,

15:35.543 --> 15:37.110
BUT SHE'LL BE OKAY.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.373
YOU'LL BE FINE.
JUST HANG IN THERE.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.376
IT HURTS TO TALK.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.247
ARE YOU OKAY?YEAH.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.989
ARE YOU COMING WITH ME?

15:47.076 --> 15:49.949
[whispers] I HAVE SOME THINGS
TO TAKE CARE OF FIRST, OKAY?

15:50.036 --> 15:53.343
AND THEN
I'LL COME SEE YOU.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.872
WE'RE TAKING OVER THIS CASE.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.571
WE'LL LIAISE
WITH THE OAKLAND P.D.,

16:03.658 --> 16:06.530
BUT WE'RE IN CHARGE. I'LL LOOK
INTO SUSPECTS WITH THE PLAYBOYS.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.532
RIGSBY AND VAN PELT WILL GO

16:08.619 --> 16:10.534
AND TALK TO THE PEOPLE
AT SEUNG'S WORK.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.710
HE WAS SHOT TWO BLOCKS
AWAY FROM WORK.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.669
MAYBE SOMEBODY SAW SOMETHING.
CHO?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.497
CHO?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.685
WHERE WE GOING?

16:30.772 --> 16:33.731
WHY DID YOU SHOOT K.S.?

16:33.818 --> 16:35.733
I MEAN, IT'S A GANG.
THERE'S GOTTA BE

16:35.820 --> 16:38.562
SOME KIND OF RULES
AGAINST THAT SORT OF THING.

16:38.649 --> 16:41.087
K.S. WANTED TO DO
A HOME INVASION.

16:41.174 --> 16:44.351
YOU GO IN, HOLD THE FAMILY
HOSTAGE AND TAKE ALL THEIR CASH.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.744
I WOULDN'T DO IT.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.746
K.S. WANTED ME ON THE JOB.
WE ARGUED.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.966
HE PULLED HIS GUN.
I PULLED MINE FASTER,

16:51.053 --> 16:53.490
TAGGED HIM IN THE SHOULDER.OUCH.

16:53.577 --> 16:56.798
THAT'S WHEN I LEFT THE GANG.
GAVE MY GUN TO DAVID.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.235
A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER
HE BOOSTED A CAR.

16:59.322 --> 17:02.108
THEY PULLED HIM OVER,
FOUND THE GUN ON HIM.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.066
WITH THE POSSESSION CHARGE,
HE GOT 15 YEARS.

17:04.153 --> 17:07.243
AND YOU FELT RESPONSIBLE
BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR GUN.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.898
NO, I THOUGHT HE WAS STUPID
TO HAVE IT ON HIM.

17:09.985 --> 17:12.422
NEVER SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT.AND THEN YOU JOINED THE ARMY?

17:12.509 --> 17:13.815
ENLISTED TWO WEEKS LATER.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.426
I WANTED TO GET
AS FAR AWAY AS I COULD.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.515
TOLD MYSELF
I'D NEVER GO BACK.OKAY.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.999
HEY. HOW'S BUSINESS?

17:28.177 --> 17:31.485
JON JON'S GONE. YOU WANT
TO TALK, YOU GO FIND HIM.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.227
NOT LOOKING FOR JON JON.
WHERE'S K.S.?WHERE'S K.S.?

17:34.314 --> 17:37.099
UH, YEAH, SIMPLE ENOUGH
QUESTION, I THOUGHT.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.536
WH--WERE YOU SERIOUS?

17:39.623 --> 17:43.149
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.
WHERE CAN I FIND HIM?I DON'T TALK TO COPS.

17:43.236 --> 17:46.021
I'M NOT A COP TONIGHT. NO BADGE.
NOW WHERE IS HE?

17:46.108 --> 17:49.329
I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL I GET
AN ANSWER FROM YOU.

17:49.416 --> 17:53.159
[grunts] AAH! [mutters]NOW I'M GONNA ASK YOU
ONE MORE TIME WHERE K.S. IS.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.378

17:55.465 --> 18:00.166

18:04.779 --> 18:06.911
[Lisbon speaks indistinctly]

18:06.998 --> 18:08.652
HAVE EITHER OF YOU HEARD
FROM JANE OR CHO?

18:08.739 --> 18:11.481
I CAN'T GET THEM ON THE PHONE,

18:11.568 --> 18:15.224
AND THEY WON'T RETURN
MY MESSAGES.I DON'T KNOW. CHO HASN'T BEEN
TO THE HOSPITAL. I CHECKED.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.966
DAMN.BOSS, I WENT OVER THE LIST OF
PEOPLE WORKING WITH DAVID SEUNG

18:18.053 --> 18:19.620
THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED.

18:19.707 --> 18:22.884
FOUR OF THEM ARE WORKING
AT THE SAME JOB SITE TODAY--

18:22.971 --> 18:25.495
A FINANCIAL FIRM CALLED
CEDAR CREEK EQUITIES.THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE JANE
AND CHO WENT TO, RIGHT?

18:25.582 --> 18:28.455
YEAH.GO AND TALK
TO WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.849
SET UP INTERVIEWS WITH ANYONE
WHO WORKED WITH DAVID SEUNG.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.025
AND IF YOU HEAR
FROM EITHER OF THEM, CALL ME.

18:36.811 --> 18:39.030
WHAT DID HE CALL IT?OCCAM'S RAZOR.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.555
WHAT IS IT?I HAVE TO LOOK IT UP.
IT'S SOME LOGIC THING.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.861
BASICALLY IT SAYS
YOU SHOULD AVOID COMPLEXITY

18:43.948 --> 18:46.299
WHEN SOLVING PROBLEMS.WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH FLIPPING HEADS 20 TIMES?

18:46.386 --> 18:48.605
I HAVE NO IDEA.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.652
HI. I'M AGENT VAN PELT.
THIS IS AGENT RIGSBY.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.872
WE'RE FROM CBI.WHAT, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

18:54.959 --> 18:56.918
NO. BUT WE NEED TO SPEAK

LIKE TO LEAVE A MESSAGE?

19:03.925 --> 19:06.275

IS HE IN THE BUILDING?SURE. UM, BUT HE COULD
BE ANYWHERE,

19:09.626 --> 19:12.412
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHEN HE'LL BE BACK.

19:12.499 --> 19:15.154
THEN MAYBE YOU COULD CALL HIM
AND ASK HIM TO COME BACK?

19:15.241 --> 19:17.025
RIGHT.
I GUESS I COULD DO THAT.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.030
BAD COLD?HMM? [sniffles]
OH, IT'S ALLERGIES.

19:22.117 --> 19:25.033
I, YOU KNOW,
THEY DRIVE ME CRAZY.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.911
THAT'S K.S.'s HOUSE?

19:33.998 --> 19:36.262
I'M GOING IN.
YOU STAY HERE. DON'T MOVE.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.177
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

19:40.396 --> 19:43.007

[sighs]

19:46.141 --> 19:49.536
[horn honks in distance]

19:51.668 --> 19:54.367
WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE MURDER
OF ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES,

19:54.454 --> 19:57.152
DAVID SEUNG.YEAH. THAT WAS SHOCKING.

19:57.239 --> 20:00.199
I SAW HIM AROUND THE OFFICE
OCCASIONALLY,

20:00.286 --> 20:03.680
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY REAL INTERACTION.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.074
I DON'T, UH, HANG OUT

20:34.320 --> 20:36.887
NOT WITH STAFF.CLEANING CREW? I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK THEM.AND WHERE
COULD WE FIND THEM?

20:36.974 --> 20:38.933
DOWNSTAIRS.

20:39.020 --> 20:42.284
BUT, UH, MY GIRL CRYSTAL CAN

22:46.452 --> 22:49.542

22:49.629 --> 22:52.283
I DIDN'T KILL DAVID. OKAY?

22:54.242 --> 22:56.157
DAVID CAME TO ME
A MONTH AGO,

22:56.244 --> 22:58.202
WANTED TO BUY SOME COKE,
5 LARGE.

22:58.289 --> 23:01.075
I HOOKED HIM UP.
THAT'S ALL I DID WITH HIM.

23:01.162 --> 23:04.426
WHAT WERE YOU ARGUING ABOUT?THAT MUCH WEIGHT
WASN'T JUST FOR HIM.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.211
I FIGURED HE WAS SELLING.YOU TOLD HIM TO CUT YOU IN.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.213
YEAH.
BUT HE WASN'T DOWN FOR THAT,

23:09.300 --> 23:11.999
SAID IT WAS A ONETIME THING
AND NO MORE.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.349
YOU'RE LYING.
I'M TAKING YOU IN.

23:14.436 --> 23:17.439
GET UP.

23:17.526 --> 23:19.789
NOT GOING
TO A GOOD PLACE, CHO.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.748
SHUT UP. GET THE DOOR.

23:25.839 --> 23:26.927
MOVE.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.849
HI.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.285
YOU MUST BE K.S.

23:47.861 --> 23:51.168
LET HIM GO.PUT YOUR GUN DOWN,
AND I'LL LET HIM GO.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.214
NO WAY. YOU.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.434
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, CHO?

23:55.521 --> 23:57.218
IT'S ON YOU.

24:00.395 --> 24:05.835
WELL, LET'S JUST TAKE A BREATH,
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT.

24:05.922 --> 24:09.230
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO SHOOT ME.NO?

24:09.317 --> 24:11.232
NO.
MY FRIEND AND I ARE COPS.

24:11.319 --> 24:14.540
NO MATTER HOW CRAZY AND TOUGH
YOU ARE,

24:14.627 --> 24:18.457
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU KILL A COP.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.633
IF YOU'RE LUCKY, YOU SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN PRISON.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.113
IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.856
CHO.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.991
YOU DON'T WANT TO SHOOT K.S.

24:31.078 --> 24:33.994
YOU DO, YOU'LL NEVER FIND OUT
IF HE KILLED DAVID.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.691
YOU'LL DESTROY YOUR CAREER
AT CBI.

24:38.302 --> 24:40.566
SO LET'S JUST EMBRACE
THIS MOMENT

24:40.653 --> 24:43.003
AND THINK...

24:43.090 --> 24:44.613
ABOUT WHAT WE WANT...

24:46.659 --> 24:48.269
AND JUST RELAX.

24:53.622 --> 24:57.496
JUST...

24:57.583 --> 25:00.150
LOOSEN UP AND RELAX.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.239
[exhales deeply]

25:02.326 --> 25:05.286
OH, YEAH. THAT FEELS
SO MUCH BETTER.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.464
GET OUT.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.248
NOW.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.252
THANK YOU.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.780
UH, ACTUALLY, I--
WHOA.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.259
WHOA.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.784
IT'S OKAY. JUST...

25:24.871 --> 25:27.177
DON'T SHOOT.

25:27.264 --> 25:30.703
JUST A PLASTIC BAG.

25:30.790 --> 25:32.618
NOTHING TO IT.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.055
THESE NUMBERS--
THEY MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

25:40.016 --> 25:42.453
YOU ARE ONE STRANGE FREAK,
MAN.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.371
OKAY. WELL,
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.417
[bag rustles]

25:49.504 --> 25:53.464
[door creaks]

25:53.552 --> 25:56.380
WE SHOULD ARREST K.S.
AND BRING HIM THERE'S PLENTY
TO HOLD HIM ON.AH, HE'D COME IN
SURROUNDED BY LAWYERS.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.557
IT'S NOT HIS FIRST TIME
IN AN INTERROGATION ROOM.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.560
BESIDES,
I THINK HE'S CLEAN FOR THIS.CLEAN? HOW?

26:01.647 --> 26:03.605
WELL, HE TOLD YOU THAT
HE SOLD THE DRUGS TO DAVID.

26:03.692 --> 26:06.869
WH-WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
WHY WOULD HE KILL HIM?

26:06.956 --> 26:08.871
WHAT'S THE MOTIVE?HEY. WOW, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.830
LIGHTER THAN AIR.MMM.

26:10.917 --> 26:13.876
WHY'D YOU CALL HIM?OH, UM,
YOU'RE AN UNRELIABLE PARTNER.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.400
I NEARLY GOT SHOT.

26:16.487 --> 26:19.447
LOOK, IF DAVID WAS SELLING,
HE WAS USING. IF HE WAS USING,

26:19.534 --> 26:22.406
HE COULD HAVE SCREWED UP
WITH K.S. A THOUSAND WAYS.SEUNG WASN'T USING.

26:22.493 --> 26:25.540
HIS TOX SCREEN CAME BACK CLEAN.
JUST GOT THE REPORT. NO DRUGS.

26:25.627 --> 26:28.238
SEE?WELL, THEN K.S. KILLED HIM
FOR ANOTHER REASON.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.545
TOO COMPLICATED.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.026
OCCAM'S RAZOR SAYS

26:33.113 --> 26:35.550
THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION
TO A PROBLEM

26:35.637 --> 26:37.508
IS USUALLY THE CORRECT ONE.
RIGHT?RIGHT.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.510
RIGHT.
SO IF I FLIP A COIN,

26:39.598 --> 26:42.122
AND I GET HEADS
20 TIMES IN A ROW,

26:42.209 --> 26:44.385
YES, I COULD HAVE
RIGGED THE COIN.

26:44.472 --> 26:47.649
BUT IF THE SIMPLE ANSWER
IS THE RIGHT ONE...

26:47.736 --> 26:49.129
TWO COINS.

26:49.216 --> 26:53.350
A 2-HEADED VERSION
TO FLIP...

26:53.437 --> 26:57.877
AND A REAL COIN TO SHOW YOU,
MY FRIEND.[sets quarter on table]

26:57.964 --> 27:01.532
I KNEW IT.WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH DAVID?

27:01.620 --> 27:04.448
DAVID BOUGHT
$5,000 WORTH OF COCAINE.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.799
HE DIDN'T SELL AND HE WASN'T
USING. THINK SIMPLE.

27:06.886 --> 27:10.411
WHO GOT THE DRUGS?

27:15.808 --> 27:17.548
[sniffles]

27:24.033 --> 27:26.906
[toilet flushes]

27:32.476 --> 27:34.304
[sniffs]

27:36.742 --> 27:38.352
[clears throat]

27:40.702 --> 27:42.486
HI, CRYSTAL.

27:42.573 --> 27:43.966
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

27:44.053 --> 27:46.316
[sniffles]

27:46.403 --> 27:48.928
WE DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT THE DRUGS.

27:49.015 --> 27:51.582
CRYSTAL, THIS IS
A HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.975
GIVE US A NAME.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.848
WAS IT DAVID SEUNG?

27:58.067 --> 27:59.808
YES.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.810
YES, IT WAS DAVID SEUNG.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.856
HE GAVE ME THE DRUGS.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.597
NO. NO, YOU JUMPED AT THAT
A LITTLE TOO EAGERLY.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.687
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA  TO LIE TO US, CRYSTAL.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.955
I CAN'T TELL.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.565
HE'LL HURT ME.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.393
OKAY.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.090
HAS HE HURT YOU BEFORE NOW?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.094
HOW?

28:25.181 --> 28:26.530
[sighs]

28:26.617 --> 28:29.055
UM... [sucks lip]

28:29.142 --> 28:32.319
HE LIKES TO GET HIGH

28:32.406 --> 28:35.148
AND BEAT ME
AND THEN HAVE SEX.

28:35.235 --> 28:38.629
CRYSTAL,
THAT'S SEXUAL ASSAULT.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.894
HE SOMEBODY YOU WORK WITH?

28:41.981 --> 28:45.288
CRYSTAL, IF YOU TELL US HIS
NAME, HE WON'T HURT YOU AGAIN.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.384
ADAM REED.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.522
OKAY.AND DID ADAM GET THE DRUGS
FROM DAVID SEUNG?

29:04.133 --> 29:06.005
YEAH. YES.

29:06.092 --> 29:08.398
HOW?

29:08.485 --> 29:10.923
ADAM CAUGHT DAVID
STEALING A LAPTOP,

29:11.010 --> 29:14.404
AND HE KNEW THAT DAVID HAD
GANG CONNECTIONS,

29:14.491 --> 29:17.277
SO HE FIGURED HE WOULD KNOW

29:17.364 --> 29:19.540
PEOPLE WHO HAD ACCESS
TO GOOD COKE.

29:19.627 --> 29:22.151
ADAM TOLD DAVID
HE WOULD TURN HIM IN

29:22.238 --> 29:25.546
UNLESS HE GOT US THE DRUGS.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.462
ADAM REED BLACKMAILED DAVID
INTO GIVING HIM THE DRUGS?

29:28.549 --> 29:30.116
YES.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.514
THANK YOU, CRYSTAL.

29:37.601 --> 29:40.343
THAT WAS LOVELY.
THANK YOU, CRYSTAL.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.128
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THESE MEAN?

29:42.215 --> 29:45.609
UH...

29:45.696 --> 29:48.656
I--WHERE DID--
HOW'D YOU GET THOSE?

30:11.766 --> 30:14.900
[Adam] ONE FOR ME.
ONE FOR YOU.[woman laughs]

30:14.987 --> 30:17.554
TWO FOR ME...[door opens]

30:20.253 --> 30:23.038
OH.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.649
[Cho] LADY, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO TO JAIL, LEAVE NOW.

30:28.391 --> 30:31.525
WHAT'S GOING ON, FELLAS?

30:31.612 --> 30:34.789
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? 'CAUSE
FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S NOT MINE.

30:34.876 --> 30:37.923
SHE BROUGHT THAT IN HERE.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.620
[handcuffs click]

30:39.707 --> 30:43.493
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
SIT DOWN.

30:43.580 --> 30:46.279
OH, YOU'RE A TRUE
RENAISSANCE MAN, AREN'T YOU?

30:46.366 --> 30:48.020
BUSINESSMAN, DRUG DEALER,

30:48.107 --> 30:49.848
BLACKMAILER, SEX ABUSER.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.372
YOU TALKIN' TO CRYSTAL?

30:52.459 --> 30:54.548
HUH? THE CRAZY COKEHEAD?

30:54.635 --> 30:56.942
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
A WORD SHE SAYS.

30:57.029 --> 30:59.640
OW!DON'T MESS WITH US.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.468
OKAY.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.992
THEN THERE'S THE SHOOTING
OF DAVID SEUNG.

31:04.079 --> 31:06.777
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.WE THINK YOU DID.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.389
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE?
'CAUSE I DO.

31:09.476 --> 31:11.957
THESE ARE PASSWORDS
TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS

31:12.044 --> 31:14.350
OF SOME OF THE FIRM'S
WEALTHIEST CLIENTS.

31:14.437 --> 31:18.877
DAVID SEUNG WAS STEALING THESE
WHEN HE WAS KILLED.

31:18.964 --> 31:22.054
THE DRUG BUY--
THAT WAS JUST A WARM-UP.

31:22.141 --> 31:25.318
THIS IS WHAT YOU REALLY
WANTED HIM TO DO, WASN'T IT?

31:25.405 --> 31:30.149
YOU WANTED HIM TO STEAL
THESE ACCOUNT NUMBERS

31:30.236 --> 31:33.587
SO THAT YOU COULD SELL THEM.
BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONGAND YOU SHOT HIM, DIDN'T YOU?YOU PEOPLE ARE INSANE.
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT!

31:33.674 --> 31:35.328
YOU DID.
THEN YOU BROKE INTO MY HOUSE

31:35.415 --> 31:37.634
AND YOU BEAT ON MY GIRLFRIEND

31:37.721 --> 31:40.855
AND THREW THE BLAME ON K.S.
AND THE PLAYBOYS, RIGHT?NO. I DIDN'T--OW!

31:40.942 --> 31:43.553
[Cho] WHERE'S THE GUN, ADAM?[Adam] WHAT GUN?
I DON'T--

31:43.640 --> 31:46.208
MAN, I WANT MY LAWYER
RIGHT NOW!

31:46.295 --> 31:48.558
[Rigsby] HEY, CHO!

31:48.645 --> 31:51.257
WHERE'S THE GUN, ADAM?WHAT GUN? AAH!

31:51.344 --> 31:54.260
THE GUN YOU USED
TO KILL DAVID.

31:54.347 --> 31:57.741
THAT'S CRAZY. MAN,
I WANT MY LAWYER RIGHT NOW.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.440
AAH!HEY, CHO, YOU GOTTA
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.833
WE CAN TAKE HIM
BACK TO THE OFFICE, OKAY?

32:02.921 --> 32:06.359
WE NEED HIM TO CONFESS. HE HAS
TO TELL US WHERE THE GUN IS.

32:06.446 --> 32:09.884
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE GUN,
HE'S GONNA WALK.WE'LL GET THERE.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.756
CHO, IT'LL BE FINE.NOW YOU GOT CUTS AND BRUISES
ON YOUR KNUCKLES.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.758
YOU GET THOSE
WHEN YOU HIT SOMEBODY.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.760
YOU WENT
TO MY GIRLFRIEND'S APARTMENT.

32:16.847 --> 32:19.154
YOU PUNCHED HER IN THE FACE
UNTIL SHE BLED.

32:19.241 --> 32:21.765
AND YOU KILLED
MY FRIEND DAVID. ADMIT IT.THAT'S FROM SOMETHING ELSE.

32:21.852 --> 32:25.334
ADMIT IT!I DID! I-I BOUGHT DRUGS
FROM DAVID SEUNG.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.336
I-I ADMIT THAT.

32:27.423 --> 32:30.383
SO? THE REST OF THIS--I DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.211
LAST CHANCE.

32:32.298 --> 32:35.301
YOU KILLED DAVID
AND YOU HID THE GUN. WHERE?

32:35.388 --> 32:38.130
I DON'T KNOW.TOO BAD.

32:41.872 --> 32:45.093
[grunts]

32:45.180 --> 32:48.053
[Adam] AAH!

32:52.231 --> 32:56.539

32:56.626 --> 32:58.541

33:31.879 --> 33:34.229
LEFT. YEAH, THAT WAY.THANK YOU!

33:39.974 --> 33:42.542
YOU SHOULD USE THIS
AS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.[voice breaks] WHAT?

NO. PLEASE DON'T. PLEASE!

33:50.680 --> 33:51.899

OH, HELL. CHO!

34:17.533 --> 34:19.057
IS HE DEAD?

34:19.144 --> 34:21.102
YES. HE WOULDN'T TALK.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.626
OH, NO.
THIS IS NOT GOOD, CHO.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.716
YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL.HE MADE ME MAD.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.718

34:34.724 --> 34:36.509
I--LISTEN.

34:36.596 --> 34:38.554
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT THIS.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.557
BE QUIET! I'M THINKING!OH, WHAT'S TO THINK ABOUT?
HE DIDN'T CONFESS.

34:41.644 --> 34:45.213
IF HE WAS GUILTY,
HE WOULD HAVE TALKED.I GUESS.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.650
WHAT DO YOU THINK, FRANK?

34:50.871 --> 34:54.788
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.182
REALLY?

34:57.269 --> 34:59.314
WELL, THAT'S ODD,

34:59.401 --> 35:03.666
'CAUSE... I THINK YOU LIED
ABOUT KNOWING THESE NUMBERS.

35:03.753 --> 35:08.715
NO, YOU'RE--YOU'RE WRONG.ALL THOSE DAYS
CLEANING THE BATHROOM,

35:08.802 --> 35:12.197
PICKING UP THE TRAIT MUST FEEL PRETTY GOOD GETTING
RICH OFF THEIR ACCOUNTS.I DIDN'T DO THAT.

35:12.284 --> 35:14.547
WHAT'S WITH THE GLOVES,
FRANK?

35:14.634 --> 35:17.506
THEY'RE WORK GLOVES.

35:17.593 --> 35:21.031
YOU'RE NOT WORKING NOW.
TAKE THEM OFF. GO ON.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.034
[Frank scoffs]IS THERE SOME REASON
YOU WON'T TAKE THEM OFF?

35:24.122 --> 35:27.037
NO.MAYBE YOU GOT SOME CUTS
AND BRUISES ON THEM.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.562
S-SLOW DOWN. THIS DOESN'T
HAVE TO END THE SAME WAY.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.781
FRANK, JUST TELL US.
TELL US THE TRUTH.

35:31.868 --> 35:34.262
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.701
YOU SHOT DAVID SEUNG.

35:38.788 --> 35:42.705
NO, I DIDN'T!YOU SAID YOU WERE
DROPPING OFF THE PAYROLL

35:42.792 --> 35:45.317
THE NIGHT THAT HE WAS KILLED.
YOU LIED TO US.

35:45.404 --> 35:48.711
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.
I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU HERE.SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.

35:48.798 --> 35:52.062
NO.SO JANE'S RIGHT.
IT WAS YOU.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.456
NO!OH, FRANK.

35:54.543 --> 35:57.067
FRANK, DON'T MAKE ME KILL YOU,
TOO. NOW YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.766
YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH,
AND I WON'T HURT YOU.

35:59.853 --> 36:02.377
I-I-I-I'M NOT...YOU.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.901
STOP! AAH! STOP! I CONFESS!
I KILLED DAVID!

36:04.988 --> 36:07.165
DON'T LET HIM SHOOT ME!
PLEASE. PLEASE.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.167
TELL THE TRUTH.HE'LL DENY IT LATER.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.995
NO! NO! I-I-I-I BROKE INTO
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S APARTMENT!

36:12.082 --> 36:15.042
I CUFFED YOU!
I MADE YOU WATCH!

36:15.129 --> 36:17.827
LOOK. SEE?

36:17.914 --> 36:19.220
SEE MY HANDS?

36:19.307 --> 36:21.527
WHERE'S THE GUN?

36:21.614 --> 36:24.617
IN THE STORM DRAIN
OUT FRONT.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.836
IT'S OKAY. I BELIEVE HIM.
I BELIEVE HIM.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.751
RIGSBY.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.412
WAIT.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.243
YOU--YOU KILLED HIM.[Patrick] AH, NOPE.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.691
CHO, HE'S CONFESSED.
YOU WON.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.693
YOU WON.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURT HIM.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.566
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURT HIM.

37:00.653 --> 37:01.915
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.569
IT'S OKAY.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.098
OOH!

37:14.057 --> 37:16.712
[siren wailing in distance]

37:21.413 --> 37:23.806
WE FOUND THE GUN.
BALLISTICS ARE A MATCH.

37:23.893 --> 37:26.809
YOU DIDN'T HIRE DAVID
TO GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.594
YOU HIRED HIM
TO STEAL FOR YOU.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.857
HE WAS LIFTING
LAPTOPS AND DATA.

37:30.944 --> 37:34.034
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS THREATEN
TO VIOLATE HIS PAROLE.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.079
WHY KILL HIM?
HE WAS STEALING FOR YOU.

37:36.166 --> 37:39.257
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA QUIT.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.824
HE DIDN'T WANT ANY OF IT.

37:41.911 --> 37:44.392
SAID HE JUST WANTED
TO LIVE HIS LIFE.

37:44.479 --> 37:47.787
I THOUGHT HE WAS
GONNA TELL THE COPS.

37:58.928 --> 38:01.975
THE OTHER GUNMAN THAT WAS WITH
YOU WHEN YOU BROKE IN ON ME--

38:02.062 --> 38:05.283
WHO IS HE?

38:05.370 --> 38:07.546
TONY WADE.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.635
HE WORKS FOR ME.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.988
WE'RE DONE HERE.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.338
OKAY.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.035
COME ON.

38:34.094 --> 38:37.489
[door opens and closes]

38:37.576 --> 38:39.534
MR. REED, I APOLOGIZE
FOR ACCUSING YOU

38:39.621 --> 38:42.842
OF SEVERAL CRIMES
I KNEW YOU HAD NOT COMMITTED

38:42.929 --> 38:45.018
AND FOR ASSAULTING YOU
REPEATEDLY.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.498
THAT'S IT?

38:46.585 --> 38:49.022
YES, THAT'S IT.

38:49.109 --> 38:52.373
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
VERY GOOD.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.722
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.985
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.161
THIS CASE WON'T LAST
30 SECONDS IN A COURT.

38:58.248 --> 39:01.774
THE LAWSUITS, HOWEVER,
WILL LAST FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.776
COME ON, ADAM.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

39:03.863 --> 39:06.256
AGENT CHO,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.781
YOU'VE MADE
MY CLIENT A RICH MAN.[chuckles]

39:10.826 --> 39:12.350
ONE MORE THING.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.003
WHAT'S THAT?

39:14.090 --> 39:16.266
WE HAVE TESTIMONY
FROM CRYSTAL HARGRAVE

39:16.354 --> 39:19.792
THAT WILL LEAD TO MR. REED BEING
CHARGED WITH SEVERAL FELONIES.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.707
THEY INCLUDE
NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING,

39:21.794 --> 39:23.926
EXTORTION,
SEXUAL HARASSMENT--

39:24.013 --> 39:26.799
NEVER BE ADMITTED.
FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE.

39:26.886 --> 39:30.846
NOT EVEN
FROM THE SAME FOREST.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.414
OUR D.A. IS WILLING
TO TALK A DEAL WITH MR. REED

39:33.501 --> 39:36.330
IN THE INTEREST
OF MENDING FENCES,

39:36.417 --> 39:39.377
IF HE'S INTERESTED
IN MENDING FENCES WITH US.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.686
[speaks indistinctly]

39:48.734 --> 39:50.823
WE'LL SPEAK TO THE D.A.GOOD.

40:36.651 --> 40:40.176
MRS. SEUNG.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.743
MAY I COME IN?

40:47.357 --> 40:48.968
THANK YOU.

41:01.197 --> 41:04.244
WHEN I HEARD
DAVID HAD BEEN KILLED,

41:04.331 --> 41:08.640
I ASSUMED IT WAS
BECAUSE OF THE MISTAKES HE MADE,

41:08.727 --> 41:10.946
BECAUSE HE HADN'T CHANGED
HIS WAYS.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.688
YES?

41:13.775 --> 41:16.256
I WAS WRONG.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.304
YOU WERE RIGHT.

41:24.090 --> 41:26.005
DAVID HAD CHANGED.

41:28.616 --> 41:31.271
DAVID CALLED ME...

41:33.186 --> 41:34.970
TO ASK FOR MY HELP.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.497
BUT I NEVER CALLED HIM BACK.

41:47.069 --> 41:51.465
WHEN I LEARNED
HE'D BEEN KILLED,

41:51.552 --> 41:53.511
I DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT

41:53.598 --> 41:57.515
THAT MAYBE HE'D
TURNED HIS LIFE AROUND,

41:57.602 --> 41:59.952
BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN
ADMITTING THAT I LET HIM DOWN.

42:02.998 --> 42:05.087
[speaking Korean]
