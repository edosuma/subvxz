WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.720
Marcos, it's Reeva.
She wants to do something

00:19.753 --> 00:21.422
so monstrous that
it changes the world forever.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.358
I need to stop her.
I can't do that by myself.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.663
REED: Lauren's obsessed
with that music box.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.765
Her powers are changing.
She's becoming more violent,

00:31.799 --> 00:33.033
more powerful.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.069
Andy went down the same path.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.537
He was obsessed
with my family history,

00:36.570 --> 00:38.672
-the power.
-No.

00:38.706 --> 00:42.076
(pants, grunts)

00:42.110 --> 00:44.445
I think it might be time
for you to reach out

00:44.478 --> 00:46.280
-to Lauren.
-Bring her here?

00:46.314 --> 00:48.116
Your mind is connected
to Lauren's.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.084
We can reach her, through you,

00:50.118 --> 00:52.453
if you let us.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.288
GLOW: Your ex,
the one you told me about,

00:54.322 --> 00:55.623
you still have feelings
for her?

00:55.656 --> 00:57.057
No. It's...

00:57.091 --> 00:59.026
it's a lot more
complicated than that.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.094
ERG:
You gave up your life,

01:00.128 --> 01:01.095
everything you know,

01:01.129 --> 01:02.463
a man you love,

01:02.496 --> 01:03.931
all for what you believe.

01:03.964 --> 01:07.301
This... this is
your community now.

01:07.335 --> 01:11.071
Welcome home, Blink.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.474
-(siren wailing in distance)

01:23.984 --> 01:25.119
Pam.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.754
Oh, thank God.

01:26.787 --> 01:27.688
Hi.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.592
(panting)

01:31.625 --> 01:33.761
I was getting worried.
What took you so long?

01:33.794 --> 01:36.096
Sentinel Services, they had
a checkpoint set up on First.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.466
They were checking IDs,
looking for fugitives.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.468
They weren't supposed
to be there for hours.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.570
-How'd you get through?
-They were scanning for X-Genes.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.572
Saw I wasn't a mutant,
let me through.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.641
We got to warn the others.
Evangeline's already on her way

01:47.675 --> 01:49.643
-to the border
with the refugees.
-Wh... Leo, no.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.280
It's too dangerous. Evangeline,
she can handle things.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.148
-Not if she's walking
into an ambush.
-She's fine!

01:54.182 --> 01:56.284
Once she gets to Flint,
she'll know what to do.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.286
(stammers)
We don't know if she...

02:00.221 --> 02:03.123
How did you know
where she was crossing?

02:03.157 --> 02:06.126
Y-You. I...

02:06.160 --> 02:07.861
I think you told me.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.463
No. I never tell anyone

02:09.497 --> 02:12.266
about the crossing locations,
not even you.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.269
(laughs):
It's not...

02:15.303 --> 02:17.605
Leo, you must have told me,

02:17.638 --> 02:20.708
-because how...
-Pam, what did you do?

02:23.411 --> 02:26.113
(sighs)

02:26.146 --> 02:28.649
Sentinel Services, they...

02:28.682 --> 02:30.050
they caught me...

02:30.083 --> 02:31.819
three weeks ago.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.387
But, Leo...

02:33.421 --> 02:35.956
Leo, I made a deal, for us.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.559
All those people are gonna d...

02:38.592 --> 02:39.793
I'm sorry.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.994
You're sorry?!

02:41.028 --> 02:42.296
They're gonna die.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.132
There-there are mothers,
children.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.335
They would have
caught them anyway. Please.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.003
Please, let's just go.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.039
We can start over.

02:52.072 --> 02:55.175
Please. I love you.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.979
The others warned me
not to trust a human.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.080
Leo...

03:00.113 --> 03:02.650
Never again.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.018
Get out of my sight.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.289
Go!

03:22.436 --> 03:26.073
There's a couple in the west
tunnel that could use this.

03:26.106 --> 03:29.209
And the rest can go
to winter storage.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.279
When's the supply run?

03:31.312 --> 03:32.513
We move out soon.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.081
The others
are getting ready now.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.616
GLOW:
You know,

03:35.649 --> 03:37.418
you've been here
for less than a week.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.219
You don't have to come
on every raid.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.421
Just trying to do my part.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.122
I don't want to be a mooch.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.292
Hey. Seriously,

03:44.325 --> 03:45.626
take your time, get settled in.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.728
You don't have
to prove anything.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.062
We can handle this.

03:53.166 --> 03:56.737
I'm just making up
for lost time.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.741
I spent so many years up there,
hiding who I was.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.379
Plus, I can't let you have
all the fun.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.048
(laughs):
Yeah. That's right.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.050
Let's move out.

04:10.083 --> 04:14.755
Looks like Zingo's
missing Clarice.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.624
(Zingo whines)

04:16.657 --> 04:19.627
She chose to leave.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.763
REED: Listen, I've been calling
around, and besides Evangeline,

04:22.796 --> 04:25.466
we lost the leaders of the West,
the Midwest and the South.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.768
They're all dead.
We need to decide what

04:27.801 --> 04:29.470
-we're gonna do.
-THUNDERBIRD:
I think it's obvious.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.672
Gather together what's left, and
we make a plan to strike back.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.642
But, John, after what happened,
why would anyone sign up?

04:34.675 --> 04:37.678
What other choice do we have?
We gonna give up? Hide?

04:37.711 --> 04:39.813
You think we're in a position
to start an army?

04:39.847 --> 04:43.317
-The Inner Circle
is after Lauren.
-I can handle it.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.786
But you can't keep waking
yourself up every 20 minutes,

04:45.819 --> 04:47.521
not allowing yourself to dream.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.090
And there's another thing.
My brother said

04:50.123 --> 04:52.360
that Reeva Payge
has infiltrated the government.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.494
ECLIPSE:
And Benedict Ryan is leading

04:53.527 --> 04:56.129
the Purifiers
in a nationwide crusade.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.165
And the two of them
working together...

04:58.198 --> 04:59.933
This is exactly why
we have to fight.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.003
The Inner Circle, the Purifiers,
they want the same thing:

05:03.036 --> 05:04.372
humans and mutants living apart.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.775
They're gonna try to drive
a wedge between us, forever.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.009
If we do not act on this now...

05:09.042 --> 05:10.310
ECLIPSE:
John is right.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.179
Lorna's risking her life
to find out

05:12.212 --> 05:13.647
about this attack
they're planning.

05:13.681 --> 05:17.050
If she gets something, anything,
we need to be ready.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.430
(rumbling)

05:42.009 --> 05:43.176
(chuckles):
That was insane.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.478
Nice trick.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.814
Yeah, you just gotta rub things
the right way.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.149
-Mm.
-Maybe I could
show you sometime.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.518
In your dreams.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.652
Ooh.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.987
So, we're blowing up
statues now?

05:54.021 --> 05:57.224
We get this thing right, it'll
be a lot bigger than statues.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.759
(sighs):
Scale this thing up,

05:58.792 --> 06:01.495
can take a whole building down
the same way.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.362
(chuckles)

06:11.639 --> 06:13.306
(grunts, yells in pain)

06:14.575 --> 06:17.244
Whoa. Are you okay?

06:17.277 --> 06:20.347
No, it's nothing.
I just got sloppy.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.783
Hey, uh,
I sprung a leak over here.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.251
Gonna go clean this up.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.358
The new recruits seem
to be coming along nicely.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.194
What about the other project?

06:34.227 --> 06:37.798
Lauren? Oh,
it's only a matter of time.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.700
Is she still resisting?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.769
We're trying something new.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.255
ECLIPSE:
You broke into his room?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.357
I didn't "break" anything.
I opened some locks.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.292
That's not the point.
The risk of doing that...

07:39.326 --> 07:41.829
Just being there is a risk!
If we're gonna find out

07:41.862 --> 07:44.164
what Reeva's planning, I'm
gonna have to do some digging.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.634
And, Marcos...

07:46.667 --> 07:48.869
it was worth it.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.304
What did you get?

07:52.172 --> 07:54.007
Building plans.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.276
The White House, Pentagon,

07:56.309 --> 07:59.379
Sentinel Services Headquarters,
the Capitol.

07:59.412 --> 08:02.449
-Max can turn those buildings
into explosives.
-Yeah.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.653
Of course. Their plan is to
wipe out the entire government?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.354
For a start.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.858
This attack is coming.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.993
-(sighs heavily)
-And soon.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.528
(quietly):
Yeah.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.030
I should go.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.465
Hey, wait.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.901
No more plans
involving stabbing yourself.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.135
Okay?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.804
I'll do my best.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.172
Thank you.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.353
(thunder crashing)

08:43.456 --> 08:46.059
GLOW: We usually have about ten
minutes before the cops show.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.494
BLINK:
Perfect.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.263
-Let's go shopping.
-Focus on food and fuel,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.866
things we can carry easily.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.334
BLINK:
Perfect.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.770
Freeze-dried ice cream.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.607
Never understood it.
It's not icy or creamy.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.641
It's good. Take it.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.545
(dogs barking in distance)

09:05.579 --> 09:06.747
(indistinct chatter)

09:09.082 --> 09:10.884
BLINK:
Why am I hearing dogs?

09:10.918 --> 09:12.452
-Cops.
-BLINK: Cops?

09:12.485 --> 09:14.888
-You said ten minutes.
-They've never been this fast.

09:14.922 --> 09:15.823
We have to get out of here.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.290
GLOW: You guys, get down.
We have to go.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.627
(barking continues)

09:19.660 --> 09:21.461
BLINK: They're getting closer.
Let's go.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.064
GLOW:
Hurry. Get down from there.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.432
MAN:
This way, this way!

09:28.101 --> 09:30.938
Go! Hurry!

09:30.971 --> 09:33.240
COP:
There they are! The mutants!

09:33.273 --> 09:34.742
-BLINK: Hurry!
-COP: Stop them!

09:37.277 --> 09:40.180
No. Mason! Grab her!

09:41.014 --> 09:43.150
(dogs continue barking)

09:48.421 --> 09:50.090
I-I gave her something
for the pain,

09:50.123 --> 09:51.458
but I can't stop the bleeding.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.660
There's gotta be
something more you can do.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.828
Her blood--
I think the clotting factor's

09:54.862 --> 09:57.798
-different or something.
-"Or something"?
Is that a medical term?

09:57.831 --> 09:58.699
I used to be an EMT, okay?

09:58.732 --> 09:59.833
I've never worked with blood
like hers.

09:59.867 --> 10:04.237
I gave her some O neg,
but her BP keeps dropping.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.674
(gasping breaths)

10:06.707 --> 10:07.808
Glow's in really bad shape.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.978
This is my fault.
With the Mutant Uprising,

10:11.011 --> 10:12.012
there's more security
everywhere. I...

10:12.045 --> 10:13.246
The only thing that matters now

10:13.280 --> 10:14.682
is that we get her
to a hospital.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.650
-Blink, we can't do that.
-What are you talking about?

10:16.684 --> 10:19.352
-She's dying.
-She's a fugitive.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.821
If we take her
to a human hospital,

10:20.854 --> 10:21.689
she'll be arrested in minutes.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.456
Could compromise
our entire community.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.759
Erg, she is not going
to betray you.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.127
Not intentionally, no.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.130
But Sentinel Services
can be very convincing.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.265
So then what do you
suggest we do?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.935
The best we can
with what we have.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.170
(Glow panting, shuddering)

10:42.642 --> 10:44.812
THUNDERBIRD: Come on, you guys.
We are the last

10:44.845 --> 10:45.979
of the Mutant Underground.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.014
If you just listen for a sec...

10:47.047 --> 10:48.181
We came
because we thought you had

10:48.215 --> 10:49.549
a plan to beat the Inner Circle.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.219
Have you seen the Mutant
Uprising rallies in the streets?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.386
We're outnumbered,
out-powered...

10:53.420 --> 10:55.022
Nobody said that
this would be easy.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.190
The X-Men trusted us with this!

10:57.224 --> 11:00.360
The X-Men's trust isn't
gonna stop Purifiers with guns.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.995
Maybe your girlfriend
had the right idea,

11:02.029 --> 11:03.831
-joining up with the Morlocks.
-That's a bit much, Gina.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.000
Hey, this is exactly what the
Inner Circle wants, all right?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.468
The Mutant Underground
to give up.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.470
For us to lose sight
of our mission.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.672
But once we abandon
our principles,

11:12.706 --> 11:14.541
our only option is war.

11:14.574 --> 11:15.375
ECLIPSE:
Come on.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.977
Look, we cannot let them win.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.812
Everything is at stake here.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.182
I'm sorry, guys, but if all
you've got for us is speeches,

11:22.215 --> 11:24.517
then they've already won.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.359
(door closes)

11:36.797 --> 11:38.431
You sure you're okay?

11:38.465 --> 11:41.668
No more problems
with your powers?

11:41.701 --> 11:42.669
A few twinges.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.004
But it's under control.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.273
We need to focus on Lauren.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.941
There's nothing you can do.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.843
(sighs)

11:49.877 --> 11:51.344
More coffee?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.280
Lauren, this isn't gonna work.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.714
You need to get some sleep.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.516
I'll be okay.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.053
You've been sharing dreams
with Andy for months,

12:00.087 --> 12:02.055
and now you're afraid to sleep?

12:02.089 --> 12:03.456
He's different.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.793
It's like he's probing my mind,

12:05.826 --> 12:07.928
searching for my weaknesses.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.231
Lauren, we need
to work this out.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.702
Hi. I'm so sorry
to just come in like this.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.404
-Clarice? What are you...
-I need your help.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.972
A friend of mine
in the tunnels,

12:19.006 --> 12:20.941
she was shot.
Can you come with me?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.109
Don't they have doctors
down there?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.210
No, there's a guy,

12:23.243 --> 12:24.577
but he's-he's in way
over his head.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.379
She needs you.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.148
The Morlocks are mutant
separatists. You can't just take

12:28.181 --> 12:29.783
-a human down there.
-She's dying.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.285
And if anyone has a problem with
it, they can take it up with me.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.754
Caitlin, please,
she doesn't have much time.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.089
Mom, go.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.091
I'll be okay.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.760
I-I'll get my stuff.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.629
Thank you.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.597
I'm sorry.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.101
We're not portaling out?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.436
No. Not yet.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.172
I have to make one more stop
before we leave.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.177
(music box playing)

13:08.388 --> 13:11.324
Lauren, we discussed this,
and...

13:11.358 --> 13:14.127
I told you
to put that thing away.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.628
It's just a music box.

13:15.662 --> 13:19.099
It is more than that.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.102
And I am worried
that it's making you feel worse.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.971
Actually,

13:24.004 --> 13:26.473
it's comforting, in a way.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.109
Reminds me that

13:29.142 --> 13:32.079
all of this has been a part
of our family for a long time.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.849
Wait.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.817
Dad.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.719
(music stops)

13:43.590 --> 13:47.560
My dad used to tell me
this old German story

13:47.594 --> 13:50.297
about a father out riding
in the night

13:50.330 --> 13:52.299
on horseback with his son.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.302
And the son is afraid.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.639
He says he can hear something
terrible calling out to him.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.841
So, the father tries
to make him feel better

14:01.875 --> 14:06.213
and tells him it's the wind
in the trees that he can hear.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.182
But when they get home,
the boy is dead.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.653
The song that plays in that box

14:13.686 --> 14:16.823
is the story
I just told you set to music.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.925
It's called "The Erlking."

14:17.958 --> 14:21.494
And I didn't think about it
at the time, but I...

14:21.528 --> 14:24.998
I think my dad
was trying to warn me.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.400
About what?

14:28.701 --> 14:31.771
About the darkness
that exists in our family.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.674
Darkness?

14:34.707 --> 14:38.111
Dad, you're talking
about something that's

14:38.145 --> 14:39.779
in my DNA.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.114
Mom thinks it's a good thing.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.050
She wants me to get stronger.
But you,

14:43.083 --> 14:45.052
-you keep...
-I am trying to warn you.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.954
The von Strucker twins...

14:46.987 --> 14:48.521
Were horrible people.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
I know.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.526
But they're also
the only people ever

14:53.560 --> 14:57.130
who really understood
what I'm going through,

14:57.164 --> 14:59.099
what I'm missing.

15:01.334 --> 15:05.705
The power that exists
between you and your brother,

15:05.738 --> 15:07.607
that level of destruction...

15:09.076 --> 15:11.578
...you can't want that.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.647
I know it's wrong.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.783
But the power--

15:16.816 --> 15:19.786
it's incredible.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.555
It doesn't feel evil.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.892
It feels like I can make
everything wrong with the world

15:25.925 --> 15:27.694
right again.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.300
Yeah, but you know
that's not true.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.670
(scoffs softly)

15:37.704 --> 15:40.140
Of course not.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.979
I'm sorry. I'm...

15:46.013 --> 15:48.982
just being stupid.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.618
(sighs)

15:51.651 --> 15:53.987
There is no one down here
to meet us.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.522
Does Erg even know we're coming?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.690
(scoffs)
I'll take that as a no.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.959
Look, I ran off to get you
as fast as I could.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.429
You really think I can help her?

16:02.462 --> 16:03.963
Well, you guys both have
glowing blood.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.033
-That's got to count
for something.
-Please, please tell me

16:06.066 --> 16:07.367
-there's more science than that.
-I... (scoffs)

16:07.400 --> 16:09.369
I'm no mutant biology expert,

16:09.402 --> 16:11.471
but it's likely
your powers are related.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.974
And I'm certain
there's no other...

16:15.008 --> 16:16.643
choice.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.778
(indistinct chatter)

16:39.499 --> 16:41.668
RAY:
Are you a-a doctor?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.236
She's close enough.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.705
I tried to stabilize her.
I-I've never seen blood

16:45.738 --> 16:47.140
like hers before.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.909
I have. The light's carried
in the platelets.

16:49.942 --> 16:53.213
But once the energy dissipates,
it's more or less regular blood.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.615
It does interfere
with clotting though.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.718
Oh, no. Marcos.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.354
What the hell is going on?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.356
You said that we couldn't
take her to the hospital,

17:03.390 --> 17:04.657
so I brought someone here.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.592
You brought a human down.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.926
You've put our whole community
in danger.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.995
Okay, look, man, relax.
We're just trying to help here.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.497
That's all.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.565
RAY:
Pulse is thready.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.701
There's too much blood.
I-I can't see. More gauze.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.703
I'm sorry, but you can't be
here. You don't belong.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.106
You should go back
to your own people.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.673
Everyone I know is a mutant,
including my family.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.209
Don't tell me who my people are.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.576
We cannot have a human
down here.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.113
Well, you're gonna have
one less mutant if I don't

17:26.146 --> 17:27.414
stop the bleeding.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.650
Erg, please.

17:31.751 --> 17:32.885
ERG:
Fine.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.755
(Glow gasping)

17:42.295 --> 17:45.165
(rain falling, thunder rumbling)

17:52.339 --> 17:53.640
Come on.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.443
Lauren, come on.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.179
(sighs)

18:05.418 --> 18:07.320
(groans)

18:20.032 --> 18:21.568
(echoes):
Lauren.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.902
I've been waiting.

18:22.935 --> 18:23.970
No.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.972
No, stop.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.175
-(thunder crashing)
-(gasps)

18:34.847 --> 18:35.948
You're back.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.318
This needs to stop.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.320
I'm never joining
the Inner Circle.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.655
Whoa, just-just listen to me.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.291
I was wrong, okay? I don't want

18:44.324 --> 18:46.159
-to fight you anymore.
-Then what do you want?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.460
I just want you to be happy.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.997
Do you remember what it was like
when we were kids?

18:51.030 --> 18:54.133
How connected we were.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.169
I miss that.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.239
Me, too.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.643
FROST SISTERS:
We can have that again,

19:03.676 --> 19:06.179
just you and me.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.518
We're the only ones who
really understand each other.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.722
I know you feel it, too.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.525
Yes.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.829
I miss who we were
when we were together.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.298
I miss Fenris.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.634
So do I.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.068
This is a dream.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.036
We can do anything...

19:30.069 --> 19:31.003
...we want here.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.739
Can't we just...

19:32.772 --> 19:33.806
...let go,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.141
be ourselves?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.710
What do you say?

20:23.823 --> 20:25.958
(exhales)

20:25.992 --> 20:28.261
(chuckles)

20:28.295 --> 20:30.363
-Wow.
-Yeah.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.432
It doesn't just have to be
a dream.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.401
You can meet me here tomorrow.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.737
Think of what we could do.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.141
I-I don't know.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.976
You do know.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.978
Think of what we can do.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.414
Both of us, together.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.683
No, Andy, I can't.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.153
-Lauren.
-Wait!

20:54.954 --> 20:56.323
-Lauren!
-Wait!

20:57.290 --> 20:58.090
Wait!

20:58.124 --> 21:00.493
(gasps)

21:10.670 --> 21:13.105
Your blood's pretty.

21:13.139 --> 21:16.309
-Yeah, so is yours.
-(chuckles groggily)

21:16.343 --> 21:18.144
You, uh, you enjoying
that morphine there?

21:18.177 --> 21:20.647
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, you are. (chuckles)

21:20.680 --> 21:23.015
ERG: You said
the transfusion would work.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.351
Well, it bought her some time,

21:24.384 --> 21:26.319
but her blood
still isn't clotting.

21:26.353 --> 21:29.322
Look, I, uh... I've seen this
before with Marcos.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.957
I-I think I can do something,

21:30.990 --> 21:32.325
but I need to get to the clinic.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.327
No. No way.
Between the Inner Circle

21:34.361 --> 21:35.928
and the Purifiers,
that place is trashed.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.130
Trashed or not,
it's our only option.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.000
Fine. Blink and I
will get whatever you need.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.603
I need to go with you.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.472
Out of the question.
It's far too dangerous.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.440
Well, I need
to isolate Marcos's platelets

21:47.474 --> 21:50.477
and mix them with an antiplasmin
in a centrifuge.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.845
And I am guessing
you're not a pharmacist

21:52.879 --> 21:55.314
and a postapocalyptic pirate.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.151
If we run into trouble,
you have no powers.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.687
We can't have dead weight.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.493
I may not have an "M"
on my face...

22:08.060 --> 22:10.062
...but I can
take care of myself.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.998
(Erg sighs)

22:12.031 --> 22:14.467
REED:
Lauren?

22:14.501 --> 22:16.436
Hey.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.822
THUNDERBIRD:
What did the note say?

22:35.855 --> 22:38.825
She said she needed to get away
to figure things out,

22:38.858 --> 22:41.561
-that I would never understand.
-Understand what?

22:41.594 --> 22:44.397
Her connection to the music box,
and to Andy.

22:44.431 --> 22:47.233
Did the note say anything
about where she might be going?

22:47.266 --> 22:49.268
No. This is all my fault, man.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.237
It's no one's fault, all right?

22:51.270 --> 22:53.573
Except maybe the Inner Circle.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.443
-If they get Andy and Lauren
together...
-I know.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.311
We have to find her, John,
before they do.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.182
POLARIS: So, how's, uh,
this whole team thing work?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.617
Seems you got a system going.

23:04.651 --> 23:08.354
Well, Max charges things
with energy, I teleport 'em

23:08.387 --> 23:11.357
and Tico, he disrupts 'em
with a shockwave.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.694
How, uh, how...
how big can the boom get?

23:14.727 --> 23:16.763
I'll let you know
when we find out.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.631
(Polaris laughs)

23:18.665 --> 23:22.435
Yo! Which one of you
was in my room?

23:22.469 --> 23:24.571
-What are you talking about?
-I have had my cell tossed

23:24.604 --> 23:26.205
enough times in the joint
to know

23:26.238 --> 23:27.540
someone was messing
with my stuff.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.976
You're drunk and paranoid.
Relax.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.111
MAX:
Don't tell me to relax.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.480
Someone was in my room.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.582
You're not in the joint anymore.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.950
No one here is gonna mess
with your stuff.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.152
Maybe.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.790
Maybe not.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.758
(scoffs softly)

23:47.527 --> 23:51.263
I'll, uh, leave you
to your family squabble.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.585
Anything?

24:12.619 --> 24:16.723
Picking up something,
but... it's faint.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.106
What's wrong?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.175
She's walking in circles.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.144
She's confused.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.979
Confused about what?

24:40.012 --> 24:43.883
Her powers,
her place in this war.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.686
Have you talked
to her about this?

24:46.719 --> 24:48.555
I tried, but...

24:48.588 --> 24:51.724
Lauren's experience
is nothing like mine.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.199
CAITLIN:
Oh, geez...

25:00.232 --> 25:03.002
ERG:
My God. What happened here?

25:03.035 --> 25:05.337
What didn't happen here?

25:05.371 --> 25:07.506
Purifiers hit this place hard.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.042
I'm gonna go check the front,
make sure we're clear.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.211
Yeah. Yeah.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.849
Why would the Purifiers hit
a medical clinic?

25:16.883 --> 25:20.720
Because we're the only place
in the area that treats mutants.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.989
So mutants worked here?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.925
Actually, no.
Humans worked here.

25:25.958 --> 25:30.196
Humans that were willing
to risk prison to help people.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.000
All people.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.835
(cabinet opening)

25:35.868 --> 25:37.570
(items clattering)

25:37.604 --> 25:41.240
Hopefully, the looters weren't
into centrifuges.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.943
Oh!

25:43.976 --> 25:46.145
That's one piece of luck.

25:47.479 --> 25:50.149
Help me search that.
We're looking for antiplasmin.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.620
-What is it?
-It enhances

25:53.653 --> 25:56.288
blood clot formation
by inhibiting protein.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.190
Maybe start
with what color it is?

25:58.224 --> 26:01.427
Right.
The one with the blue top.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.731
Hey, the front area's
even worse.

26:04.764 --> 26:05.898
How long is this gonna take?

26:05.932 --> 26:08.100
I've got a really bad feeling
about this place.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.501
Then let's make it quick.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.107
It's mutant lawlessness.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.543
If they don't act like citizens
of this country,

26:17.576 --> 26:20.246
why should they enjoy the rights
afforded to those of us

26:20.279 --> 26:22.214
who choose to abide by the law?

26:22.248 --> 26:25.451
Even human protests have
a tendency to turn violent.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.655
Can you imagine the horrors
we might soon witness

26:28.688 --> 26:30.256
if we don't get
these animals under...

26:30.289 --> 26:33.125
MAN: Why are you doing this?
This is illegal!

26:33.159 --> 26:35.261
We've had reports
of suspicious mutant activity.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.629
We haven't done anything wrong!

26:36.663 --> 26:39.065
We're just going
to visit my mother in Chicago.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.466
-AGENT: Open the bags.
-You have no right

26:40.499 --> 26:43.135
-to do this.
-Stop, please!

26:43.169 --> 26:44.904
-Dad.
-No.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.505
MAN:
Stop. Okay, just let us go.

26:46.538 --> 26:49.642
It'll be okay, baby.
It'll be okay.

26:51.477 --> 26:53.479
RYAN: You can't disarm
a living, breathing weapon,

26:53.512 --> 26:56.315
which is exactly
what mutants are.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.758
(quietly):
Yeah.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.760
(sighs)

27:07.794 --> 27:10.596
Okay. Looks like it's time.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.231
Liar.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.101
It was time ten minutes ago.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.969
(laughs)
Yeah, well,

27:17.003 --> 27:19.839
I thought I should top you off.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.507
How you feeling?

27:23.409 --> 27:25.277
I still feel like I got shot,

27:25.311 --> 27:28.014
-but thanks for asking.
-(laughs)

27:28.047 --> 27:30.116
How about you?

27:30.149 --> 27:31.718
How have you been?

27:31.751 --> 27:33.352
That's not important.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.488
You're supposed
to keep me awake, so...

27:36.522 --> 27:39.158
you have
to answer all my questions.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.227
-That's how it is?
-Yeah. It's the rules.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.895
-Ah, there's rules.
-(laughs)

27:42.929 --> 27:44.897
-(laughs)
-(phone vibrates)

27:44.931 --> 27:46.398
(sighs)

27:49.836 --> 27:51.403
Your ex?

27:51.437 --> 27:53.639
Yeah.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.842
Lorna, everything okay?

27:55.875 --> 27:58.244
Okay, remember how you
freaked out at me for breaking

27:58.277 --> 27:59.846
-into Max's room?
-Yeah.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.914
Okay, well, turns out it didn't
go as well as I thought.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.682
He suspects something, but...

28:03.716 --> 28:05.417
I don't think
he has anything solid yet.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.686
Okay, look,
you have to run. Now.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.321
If he tells Reeva, you're dead.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.857
But if we don't find out
what they're planning,

28:10.890 --> 28:13.559
-then more people die.
-(sighs)

28:13.592 --> 28:16.662
-And what about Andy, huh?
-All right. All right, look,

28:16.695 --> 28:18.998
if we can't get you
out of there,

28:19.031 --> 28:22.434
then we have to get Max
out of there.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.403
What are we gonna do with him?

28:24.436 --> 28:26.939
Well, we both know I'm pretty
good at getting people to talk.

28:26.973 --> 28:31.110
Marcos, no, you hate doing that.

28:31.143 --> 28:35.214
Yeah, I know... but this

28:35.247 --> 28:37.716
has to happen.
Look, is there any way that

28:37.750 --> 28:41.087
you can find out, you know, uh,
when he, when he goes out?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.755
When he might be alone?

28:45.224 --> 28:48.460
Yeah, there might be something
I can do.

28:48.494 --> 28:51.530
When I was a kid, I used to get
into my school's computer,

28:51.563 --> 28:52.765
change my grades.

28:52.799 --> 28:53.900
I didn't know you could do that.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.568
I'm not some kind of hacker
or anything, but...

28:56.602 --> 28:58.971
computers are magnetic,
and sometimes I can

28:59.005 --> 29:00.606
feel my way
through simple stuff,

29:00.639 --> 29:02.775
like a password
that's entered all the time.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.046
I'm gonna see what I can do.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.547
Get back to you when I can.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.882
All right. Just...

29:09.916 --> 29:11.818
(sighs)
Just be careful.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.652
Yeah.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.590
(sighs)

29:27.133 --> 29:28.734
What are you doing?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.337
Isolating Marcos's
blood components to mix

29:31.370 --> 29:33.339
-with the antifibrinolytic.
-Right.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.974
Well, I hate to rush you
when you're science-ing,

29:35.007 --> 29:37.743
-but can you just make this go
a little faster?
-(beeps)

29:37.776 --> 29:39.345
(banging nearby)

29:41.680 --> 29:43.983
-What was that?
-Purifiers are outside.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.685
-They're here?
-We have to go now.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.460
We have to get out of here.
Just bring the stuff.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.694
The stuff doesn't work that way!
I can't leave

29:55.727 --> 29:57.263
-until it's finished.
-We can't afford
more casualties.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.665
Well, then you go.
I'll come when it's done.

29:59.698 --> 30:02.301
MAN: I'm telling you,
there someone's in there.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.003
He's one of them!

30:04.036 --> 30:06.338
-(grunts)
-No!

30:08.841 --> 30:11.477
(men shouting)

30:11.510 --> 30:12.778
(grunts)

30:12.811 --> 30:14.480
MAN:
Take cover!

30:14.513 --> 30:17.383
-Now can we go?
-Not without Erg.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.384
I'm fine!

30:26.158 --> 30:29.028
-Let's go!
-Let's go.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.798
(siren wailing)

30:32.831 --> 30:35.301
(camera clicks)

30:35.334 --> 30:37.703
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

30:37.736 --> 30:39.538
Lauren was definitely here.

30:39.571 --> 30:43.242
She did that to the Sentinel
Services car, then she took off.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.977
Why would she be this reckless?

30:45.011 --> 30:46.478
I don't think she means to be.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.347
I don't think
she can help herself right now.

30:48.380 --> 30:51.050
Reed, she's not a little kid
wandering around lost.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.818
She's turning away from us.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.554
She's headed toward her brother,
toward the Inner Circle.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.224
It's not as simple as that.
The power of this thing...

30:58.257 --> 31:03.095
It's incredibly strong.
It's almost... irresistible.

31:04.563 --> 31:07.199
Are you talking about her,
or are you talking about you?

31:09.301 --> 31:11.437
Reed, I think
you understand more

31:11.470 --> 31:15.041
about Lauren's situation
than you've told her.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.976
You owe it to her
to tell her the truth.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.914
Well, then you need
to find her for me,

31:21.948 --> 31:23.849
and then I'll do what I can.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.185
All right. Come on.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.988
(camera clicking)

31:44.470 --> 31:46.638
(panting)

31:46.672 --> 31:48.440
Okay.

31:50.309 --> 31:51.877
Come on. Come on, come on.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.479
Come on.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.680
Damn it!

31:59.318 --> 32:01.287
Come on.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.625
Yes. Okay.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.931
Max, where are you?

32:12.965 --> 32:15.101
(panting)

32:19.705 --> 32:21.207
Gotcha.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.154
(beeps)

32:35.187 --> 32:37.389
"Kilroy's Liquor Store."

32:39.025 --> 32:40.426
ECLIPSE:
You said her BP is dropping.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.128
-I got to give her more.
-You can't do this.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.962
-You already gave more blood
than you should.
-Look at her.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.664
-What am I supposed to do,
just let her die?
-The nurse said,

32:45.697 --> 32:48.500
-if you lose any more blood,
you could...
-Just back off!

32:53.205 --> 32:55.441
Marcos, you can't...

32:55.474 --> 32:57.809
It's gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.811
The things you're doing...

32:59.845 --> 33:01.147
that's too important.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.814
You can't risk it.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.050
No...

33:06.918 --> 33:08.620
Hey.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.822
Hang on.

33:10.856 --> 33:11.890
How is she?

33:11.923 --> 33:13.325
Oh, finally.
Get over here.

33:13.359 --> 33:14.560
W-We're losing her.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.229
No problems?
You got the medicine?

33:17.263 --> 33:18.997
Big problems, actually.
But yeah, we did.

33:19.031 --> 33:22.201
Get her propped up. And we
need a new sheet over here.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.210
(siren wailing in distance)

33:33.712 --> 33:36.014
Lauren!

33:36.048 --> 33:38.750
I told you not to follow me.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.352
Please, listen.
We can talk.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.687
There's nothing to talk about.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.759
Lauren, I'm not going anywhere
until you talk to me!

33:56.468 --> 33:57.936
Lauren?

33:57.969 --> 33:59.438
It's all right.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.607
I know what you're doing.
You're going to Andy.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.741
I don't know.

34:02.774 --> 34:03.742
You're confused. I underst...

34:03.775 --> 34:05.577
No, you don't understand!

34:05.611 --> 34:07.913
You don't.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.582
You don't know
what it feels like.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.451
Yes, I do.

34:13.919 --> 34:15.887
Because I've felt it, too.

34:15.921 --> 34:18.157
What do you mean?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.561
I wasn't honest with you.

34:22.594 --> 34:26.064
When we got the music box
from Dr. Risman,

34:26.098 --> 34:28.900
it wasn't the first time
I'd seen it.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.537
I found it as a boy...

34:31.570 --> 34:33.972
in our attic.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.542
I was drawn to it.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.610
Like you.

34:39.845 --> 34:41.613
The story I told you...

34:41.647 --> 34:45.617
My dad wasn't warning me about
the darkness calling to me.

34:45.651 --> 34:49.421
Because he knew
I'd already liked it.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.093
I think it's one of the reasons

34:55.127 --> 34:57.296
that he tried
to suppress my powers.

35:01.133 --> 35:05.003
(quietly):
I-I-I can't resist it anymore.

35:06.205 --> 35:09.408
I know, honey,
but you're not alone.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.110
And I think I can help you.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.529
(clapping)

35:33.499 --> 35:34.633
Bull's-eye.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.803
You shouldn't sneak up on
a woman playing with knives.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.271
Oh...

35:39.305 --> 35:41.973
You know, you are really
good with those.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.975
Maybe too good to, uh,

35:44.009 --> 35:46.845
cut yourself by accident.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.547
What's that supposed to mean?

35:48.580 --> 35:51.049
Maybe nothing.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.851
Just seems weird,
don't you think?

35:52.884 --> 35:56.822
-Mm. Well, even the best
have off days.
-Ah.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.958
Do you know what else
I think is weird?

35:59.991 --> 36:01.693
I don't know, man.
Dessert pizza?

36:01.727 --> 36:06.798
You were really interested
in that hit job

36:06.832 --> 36:08.634
me and my team did last week.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.002
I was just being friendly.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.504
Won't make that mistake again.

36:12.538 --> 36:13.839
Heather's right,
you are paranoid.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.174
I don't think so, sweetheart.

36:16.208 --> 36:19.845
You see, my guess is...

36:19.878 --> 36:24.182
I think you're forgetting
who you're talking to.

36:25.551 --> 36:28.086
I am Polaris.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.088
My father was part
of the Inner Circle

36:30.121 --> 36:32.724
before it even was
the Inner Circle.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.426
Around here...

36:34.460 --> 36:39.865
that... makes... me... royalty.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.668
So if you're gonna
run your mouth,

36:42.701 --> 36:45.604
you better have a lot more
than a guess.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.442
Sure thing, Your Majesty.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.431
We should go.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.568
Your heart sounds strong.

37:16.602 --> 37:20.138
-Try to get some rest.
-Yeah. Thanks.

37:23.442 --> 37:26.578
You saved my life.
Thank you.

37:26.612 --> 37:27.946
Aw, it's, uh...

37:27.979 --> 37:30.115
it's nothing any guy with
glowing blood wouldn't do.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.117
(chuckles)

37:33.184 --> 37:35.354
But now you have things to do?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.490
For Lorna?

37:39.858 --> 37:41.092
Yeah.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.128
Yeah, well...

37:43.161 --> 37:46.665
I guess she'll always have
your heart.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.901
I'll just have to settle
for two pints of your blood.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.170
(chuckles)

37:56.808 --> 37:58.009
Stay safe.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.145
Yeah.

38:06.184 --> 38:08.787
Here's some extra syringes
and some gauze.

38:08.820 --> 38:12.458
You were right about her.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.593
I'm sorry.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.597
A girl can never hear
"you were right" too many times.

38:18.630 --> 38:23.301
As for the apology,
I'm not the one you owe it to.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.977
You don't have to say it.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.012
I'm leaving.
I was never here.

38:34.045 --> 38:36.482
That's not...
(sighs)

38:36.515 --> 38:39.017
I wanted to give you something
before you go.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.245
Much better.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.350
Thank you.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.858
(sighs):
All right.

39:19.891 --> 39:22.628
Are you sure you don't
want me to portal you guys out?

39:24.029 --> 39:27.866
Uh, it's fine.
We'll find our way.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.068
Just follow the rats.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.737
(laughs)

39:34.305 --> 39:37.709
Will you please give Zingo
a hug for me?

39:37.743 --> 39:39.110
Mm.

39:39.144 --> 39:41.747
And, um...

39:41.780 --> 39:43.982
We will say hi to John, too.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.320
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.951
* Open my eyes

40:19.985 --> 40:23.121
* There are stories outside

40:23.154 --> 40:26.057
* Stories have always

40:26.091 --> 40:29.394
* Been told

40:29.427 --> 40:32.330
* Let the wind in the trees

40:32.363 --> 40:36.167
* Tell its secrets to me

40:36.201 --> 40:40.506
* Everything that it knows

40:42.774 --> 40:44.776
* I wanna wake up

40:44.810 --> 40:45.911
(shuddering)

40:45.944 --> 40:48.980
* I wanna wake up

40:49.014 --> 40:53.418
* I wanna wake up...

40:53.451 --> 40:55.654
(shudders)

40:55.687 --> 40:59.090
* I wanna wake up

40:59.124 --> 41:00.659
You said she was coming.

41:00.692 --> 41:01.627
ALL:
Where is she?

41:01.660 --> 41:05.631
I don't know.
Something's changed.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.198
I can't feel her anymore.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.770
* I wanna wake up

41:11.803 --> 41:15.140
* I wanna
wake up *

41:15.173 --> 41:19.344
* I wanna wake up...

41:21.747 --> 41:24.950
* I wanna wake up

41:24.983 --> 41:28.053
* I wanna
wake up *

41:28.086 --> 41:30.989
* I wanna wake up...

41:31.022 --> 41:32.524
What's the point of being free

41:32.558 --> 41:34.292
if I can't go
where I want to go?

41:34.325 --> 41:36.427
Get off my ass, Heather.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.672
(sighs)

41:54.780 --> 41:57.515
-What the hell?
-Move real slow,

41:57.549 --> 42:00.151
or things are gonna get
very hot in here.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.153
What do you want?

42:02.187 --> 42:04.022
We're gonna go for a drive.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.924
-All right?
-Okay, okay, okay.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.093
Okay, stay calm.
I'm just--

42:08.126 --> 42:10.161
I'm just gonna put
my seat belt on.

42:10.195 --> 42:13.098
-Slowly.
-Okay.

It's time to pick a side
on The Gifted.

43:24.335 --> 43:26.638
Here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:28.874 --> 43:30.676
Welcome to the galaxy.

43:31.877 --> 43:33.845
Should be fun. I'll lead.

43:35.681 --> 43:38.583
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

43:38.616 --> 43:39.951
We're gonna make a run for it.

43:39.985 --> 43:41.186
* Live for glory, not forever *

43:41.219 --> 43:45.657
-Go!
