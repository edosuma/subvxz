00:04.879 --> 00:06.253
Hello, Viv! Hello.

00:06.278 --> 00:07.471
She sounds like a monster.

00:07.496 --> 00:09.301
Oh, I know, I won't vote
for her, she's horrific.

00:09.325 --> 00:11.480
Are you with me?

00:13.435 --> 00:16.274
Our records show you may
not have leave to remain.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.322
They're taking him away?

00:17.347 --> 00:18.885
They're flying me out at 7am.

00:18.910 --> 00:20.667
You can't deport
someone in a single day!

00:20.692 --> 00:22.610
Ho-ho, your little world.

00:22.635 --> 00:23.690
Hello, Bethany speaking.

00:23.715 --> 00:25.495
- Oh, my God!
- I had it implanted.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.134
My hand is the phone!

00:27.159 --> 00:29.284
<i>You were exposed to
one gray of radiation.</i>

00:29.309 --> 00:30.870
I think you might
have ten years.

00:33.712 --> 00:35.454
Go on, Vivienne! You did it.

00:35.938 --> 00:38.509
Stephen, how much did you lose?

00:38.534 --> 00:40.937
£1,135,000.

00:41.354 --> 00:42.518
Let me in!

00:43.737 --> 00:44.901
Where are you going to live?

00:44.902 --> 00:46.260
Welcome home.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.990
<i>Just look at the
state we are in.</i>

01:00.272 --> 01:04.452
<i>Christmas has been ruined for
so many hard-working families.</i>

01:04.655 --> 01:06.817
<i>The collapse of the
banks goes on and on.</i>

01:06.842 --> 01:08.513
<i>Now they say
Hathersage is in trouble.</i>

01:08.538 --> 01:11.567
<i>For God's sake, my mother has
got her life savings in Hathersage.</i>

01:11.592 --> 01:13.170
<i>But they've done it,
haven't they, the banks?</i>

01:13.194 --> 01:15.585
<i>They've left us completely...</i>

01:15.671 --> 01:18.333
<i>We've told you before, you
really can't use language like that.</i>

01:18.358 --> 01:20.475
<i>Well, you can
censor me all you like,</i>

01:20.799 --> 01:23.225
<i>but they swear, don't you?</i>

01:23.410 --> 01:24.410
<i>All of you.</i>

01:24.818 --> 01:26.523
<i>When you think of what
the system has done to us,</i>

01:26.547 --> 01:28.225
<i>don't you swear the roof down?</i>

01:29.181 --> 01:32.913
<i>What do we do, the rest of us
normal people? What do we do?</i>

01:32.938 --> 01:35.063
<i>Normal people? You're
a Member of Parliament.</i>

01:35.357 --> 01:36.484
<i>You're supposed
to have the answer.</i>

01:36.508 --> 01:38.859
<i>I think I have, I've
got exactly that,</i>

01:38.884 --> 01:42.054
<i>because next year we face a
general election and, God knows,</i>

01:42.079 --> 01:43.635
<i>we need to shake
things up, don't you think?</i>

01:43.659 --> 01:46.102
<i>So I propose, in order to vote,</i>

01:46.259 --> 01:50.352
<i>every British citizen
must take an IQ test.</i>

01:50.956 --> 01:51.956
What?

01:51.981 --> 01:53.309
You can't say that!

01:53.334 --> 01:54.792
Oh, she's brilliant.

01:54.817 --> 01:56.206
I said you'd like it.

01:56.231 --> 02:00.019
<i>If you score above 70,
you can vote. Simple as that.</i>

02:00.044 --> 02:02.245
Oh, she is outrageous.

02:02.270 --> 02:04.528
70's quite low.
It's not that bad.

02:04.607 --> 02:07.106
<i>Are you saying that some
people are too stupid to vote?</i>

02:07.184 --> 02:09.332
<i>No. That's what you say,</i>

02:09.550 --> 02:12.262
<i>millions of you, at work,
at home, in the pub,</i>

02:12.287 --> 02:14.301
<i>you say, "Take away the vote."</i>

02:14.527 --> 02:16.315
You say it, Dan. All the time.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.152
That was you and
Brexit, nonstop.

02:18.223 --> 02:21.590
<i>You say things are too complicated
and people are not clever enough.</i>

02:29.433 --> 02:32.401
And you said it, Steve. I
heard you. You said it last week.

02:32.434 --> 02:33.987
Oh, right. It's all my fault.

02:34.012 --> 02:36.666
- Some of us have work to do.
- Excuse me! I'm working!

02:36.691 --> 02:39.434
But he's doing
actual, physical work.

02:40.059 --> 02:42.223
- You want another cup of tea?
- No.

02:42.309 --> 02:44.901
Like it or not, she's got
a point. People are thick.

02:44.902 --> 02:47.136
Hold on. Would you ban me?

02:47.370 --> 02:48.901
Not if you passed the test.

02:49.026 --> 02:51.065
Oh, my God! You'd ban me!

02:51.409 --> 02:54.237
Edith, I don't get it. I thought
you were the great anarchist.

02:54.262 --> 02:57.712
Well, that's Vivienne Rook. She's
ripping up democracy. I love it.

02:57.737 --> 03:00.525
Hold on, though. This
isn't real. This isn't legal.

03:00.550 --> 03:03.618
She's only one MP.
She can't actually do it.

03:03.643 --> 03:06.929
Hey, one more thing about
next year, dad's birthday, his 70th.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.555
So?

03:08.768 --> 03:10.063
How is that relevant?

03:10.088 --> 03:12.409
Oh, my God. Is he 70?

03:12.760 --> 03:16.417
He's still living in Leicester,
which isn't far. Just saying.

03:16.542 --> 03:19.346
<i>2026, let the people decide,</i>

03:20.037 --> 03:21.892
<i>but only the clever ones.</i>

03:28.244 --> 03:30.868
<i>The shock from the
banking crisis continues,</i>

03:30.893 --> 03:34.766
<i>with Moody's reducing
the UK credit rating to A2.</i>

03:34.791 --> 03:38.250
<i>Panic in the City as Kleiman
Ajax has been declared bankrupt.</i>

03:38.275 --> 03:41.500
<i>Consequences for the pharmaceutical
industry will be enormous.</i>

03:41.525 --> 03:44.767
Can't get the drugs. Ordinary
drugs, you can't get them.

03:45.103 --> 03:47.041
Ruby takes Clobazam
for her epilepsy.

03:47.299 --> 03:49.936
The chemist says, "We're out of
stock. Come back in six weeks."

03:49.937 --> 03:54.554
<i>The emergency election in France
has seen a 30% swing to the right.</i>

03:54.579 --> 03:56.212
We were going to
get Viktor into France.

03:56.911 --> 03:57.911
Not any more.

03:58.399 --> 04:00.340
Now they deport
anyone without a visa.

04:06.488 --> 04:08.692
<i>In anticipation of
the general election,</i>

04:08.717 --> 04:11.214
<i>the government has
employed 10,000 data sweepers</i>

04:11.239 --> 04:13.887
- <i>to monitor Russian interference.</i>
- Hello.

04:13.888 --> 04:17.051
Hi, there, Bethany. I'm Lizzie.

04:17.416 --> 04:18.714
I like your phone.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.870
Link, radio off, call Viktor.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.519
<i>Calling Viktor.</i>

04:37.262 --> 04:38.914
Link, try again.

04:41.332 --> 04:43.770
Link, send text to Viktor.

04:44.402 --> 04:48.073
Hey, comma, get up,
you lazy bastard, full stop.

04:48.098 --> 04:52.902
Emoji kiss, emoji wink...
emoji erect penis, send.

04:53.910 --> 04:55.824
Link, try Viktor one more time.

04:55.934 --> 04:57.332
<i>Calling Viktor.</i>

05:09.245 --> 05:10.729
<i>Viktor linked.</i>

05:11.610 --> 05:15.815
Listen, I was thinking I could
come out to see you on the 1st and...

05:17.894 --> 05:19.370
Viktor, is that you?

05:21.979 --> 05:23.401
Vik, are you there? Hello?

05:24.609 --> 05:25.609
Hello.

05:27.292 --> 05:28.698
I said, hello.

05:29.979 --> 05:31.394
Hello, can you hear me?

05:32.386 --> 05:33.386
Ah.

05:42.482 --> 05:43.932
I'm not... I don't...

05:48.435 --> 05:51.771
I'm sorry, but I
can't speak.. Erm...

05:51.796 --> 05:54.607
<i>You called, Skype here, yes?</i>

05:55.599 --> 05:57.381
- Yes.
- <i>Viktor Goraya.</i>

05:57.654 --> 05:59.845
<i>You called Viktor Goraya, yes?</i>

06:00.166 --> 06:02.170
<i>Daniel Lyons is you?</i>

06:06.198 --> 06:09.138
- Yes.
- <i>You know Viktor Goraya.</i>

06:12.123 --> 06:13.435
He's my friend...

06:15.177 --> 06:17.231
and I'm calling him,
which I'm allowed to do.

06:18.153 --> 06:20.899
I haven't done anything
wrong and neither has he.

06:21.059 --> 06:22.059
Where is he?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.487
<i>It's you, huh?</i>

06:27.715 --> 06:29.214
Hello, sir.

06:41.504 --> 06:43.785
- <i>Do you pay him, Englishman?</i>
- No.

06:44.629 --> 06:47.183
<i>He's your bitch.</i>

06:49.963 --> 06:51.262
Shit.

06:51.299 --> 06:53.393
I don't know but
they were the police.

06:54.628 --> 06:56.299
Well, it was a uniform.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.753
Look, I've been out there.

06:58.778 --> 07:00.362
They were proper policemen.

07:00.682 --> 07:02.854
I'm looking for Viktor.

07:03.551 --> 07:05.565
Viktor Goraya.

07:06.501 --> 07:07.528
Erm...

07:12.651 --> 07:14.618
No, I won't be coming
into work today.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.292
- We need you.
- No, I'm sorry, I just can't.

07:16.316 --> 07:17.316
Sorry, no.

07:17.341 --> 07:20.878
He passed his Rule 35
assessment in the UK.

07:21.137 --> 07:23.291
So who do I speak to?

07:29.805 --> 07:34.297
My name is Daniel Lyons. I
work for Manchester City Council.

07:34.516 --> 07:36.941
I need some help...
For God's sake!

07:37.915 --> 07:39.055
Sorry, not you.

07:39.601 --> 07:42.679
So the police said, "Give
us his name," but if I do that

07:42.704 --> 07:45.288
and they say, "Who are you?"
and I say, "I'm his boyfriend,"

07:45.313 --> 07:46.873
what if they pass that on?

07:46.874 --> 07:49.547
Cos that's like evidence,
isn't it? So what do I do?

07:49.758 --> 07:52.829
I mean, what do I do? I
mean, really... what do I do?

07:58.046 --> 07:59.045
Hello.

07:59.070 --> 08:00.657
Hello! Hello?

08:01.196 --> 08:03.896
It's me. I'm safe. I'm okay.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.586
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God!

08:09.188 --> 08:10.928
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.704
- Where are you?
- I got away.

08:14.399 --> 08:15.852
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

08:15.877 --> 08:17.125
I'm fine. I'm with Roman.

08:17.406 --> 08:20.094
I ran so fast I didn't have
my phone, but I'm okay.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.603
I promise.

08:21.828 --> 08:24.436
Turns out he's in Odessa.

08:24.585 --> 08:26.577
Literally had two
minutes' warning.

08:26.602 --> 08:27.703
Ran before the police arrived,

08:27.727 --> 08:29.280
left everything
behind, got on a bus,

08:29.305 --> 08:31.741
this clickety-clackety
bus type thing,

08:31.766 --> 08:34.506
no suspension,
overland, nine hours later,

08:34.654 --> 08:36.059
Odessa, thank you very much.

08:36.248 --> 08:37.528
I don't even know where that is.

08:38.202 --> 08:39.623
Is he safe though, is he okay?

08:39.648 --> 08:40.717
He's got this mate, Roman,

08:40.741 --> 08:43.639
he says Viktor can
hide there for a bit, so...

08:44.465 --> 08:46.654
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks, sweetheart, thank you.

08:46.817 --> 08:48.592
- Hi, Lizzie.
- Hello.

08:48.732 --> 08:50.295
Has he actually broken the law?

08:50.320 --> 08:53.223
Well, no, technically.
Technically, no.

08:53.248 --> 08:56.879
But the Communist Party applied to
make same-sex relationships illegal,

08:56.904 --> 08:58.418
or you can't express
homosexuality.

08:58.443 --> 09:00.653
That's the phrase,
you can't express it.

09:00.678 --> 09:02.676
They tried to do
that back in 2016.

09:02.701 --> 09:06.107
Now this is the Communist
Party, this isn't a bunch of nutters,

09:06.132 --> 09:09.909
this is the people's party and
they applied again, in 2019,

09:09.934 --> 09:12.130
and, this year,
third time lucky,

09:12.155 --> 09:15.193
so, yeah, any day
now, he's a criminal.

09:18.513 --> 09:20.910
Oh, I've got to go,
mate, got to go.

09:21.536 --> 09:23.911
Delivering a parcel to
Whalley Range. Sorry.

09:23.936 --> 09:24.972
So what are you going to do?

09:24.996 --> 09:26.795
Well, we've got to get him out,
we've got to get him into a country

09:26.819 --> 09:30.497
that grants asylum but, to do
that, he's got to cross the border.

09:30.522 --> 09:32.536
- You mean illegally?
- Yeah.

09:32.668 --> 09:34.614
And how dangerous is that?

09:35.811 --> 09:36.815
Very.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.255
<i>So we'll have
to do it illegally.</i>

09:40.280 --> 09:42.917
<i>God knows how, but I've got to
get him over the border and out.</i>

09:42.942 --> 09:44.873
Oh, my God! That's amazing.

09:45.093 --> 09:46.879
Give him my love! Good luck.

09:49.303 --> 09:51.725
I'm sorry but I'm running out
of ways to say, "Oh, my God."

09:52.233 --> 09:54.853
Odessa's by the sea. I think
it's a really nice place to live.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.893
- Do you think he sends Viktor money?
- Oh, I know he does.

09:58.217 --> 09:59.990
Right, I'm late, I'm off.

10:00.037 --> 10:02.873
Bloody nerve, calling me in
at half term. I bet it's trouble!

10:03.100 --> 10:06.420
I was thinking, Lee's spending
the day with his little mate, Craig.

10:06.445 --> 10:07.456
I could take Lincoln out.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.465
There's this Chinese ceramics
thing on at the Whitworth,

10:09.489 --> 10:11.635
then we could go see
Toy Story Resurrection.

10:11.660 --> 10:13.714
You know Woody
gets burnt to death?

10:13.739 --> 10:15.354
Don't go giving him nightmares.

10:15.997 --> 10:17.215
Right, behave.

10:17.889 --> 10:19.184
There's a good boy.

10:19.402 --> 10:21.557
And you, metal head, bye-bye!

10:22.945 --> 10:23.945
Bye.

10:24.972 --> 10:28.019
What do you think? Nice little
adventure with your auntie?

10:29.269 --> 10:33.042
There. Gorgeous. Okay, don't tell
your mum and I'll give you ten quid.

10:33.176 --> 10:35.402
Who's a beautiful girl? What
do you want to be called?

10:35.427 --> 10:38.495
- Susie.
- Okay, Susie, off we go.

10:38.699 --> 10:42.175
Whoa. Now we can have
an adventure, you and me,

10:42.200 --> 10:44.105
but it's a secret
from everyone else.

10:44.130 --> 10:46.715
So if I say the word "diamond",

10:46.740 --> 10:48.431
you say, "I want
to go to the toilet."

10:48.456 --> 10:50.027
Like, oh, what a pretty diamond.

10:50.052 --> 10:51.755
I want to go to the toilet.

10:51.897 --> 10:53.629
I'd love to have a diamond.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.487
I want to go to the toilet.

10:55.512 --> 10:57.870
Someone please buy me a diamond.

10:57.895 --> 10:59.424
I want to go to the toilet.

10:59.449 --> 11:00.867
I wish I had a diamond.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.371
I want to go to the toilet.

11:02.708 --> 11:05.168
Very, very, very good...

11:05.475 --> 11:06.715
Susie.

11:13.607 --> 11:14.607
Hello.

11:15.356 --> 11:18.098
That's your bring your
daughter to work activity pack.

11:18.496 --> 11:20.379
Aren't you gorgeous?
What's your name?

11:20.404 --> 11:21.407
Susie.

11:21.432 --> 11:23.067
Welcome to Wytel, Susie.

11:31.203 --> 11:34.105
So just pretend
you're very, very sad.

11:36.269 --> 11:39.988
Hello, I'm Holly. I'm in charge
of the daughters' playgroup.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.753
I've not seen you
before, have I?

11:41.778 --> 11:44.009
No, it's all this hot desking.

11:44.034 --> 11:45.650
I normally, sort
of, work over there.

11:45.675 --> 11:49.034
This is Susie. She's a bit sad at
the moment because her father,

11:49.059 --> 11:51.448
you know, let's not
get into it! The buffoon!

11:51.550 --> 11:53.097
So be nice to her.

11:53.269 --> 11:54.689
Oh, of course I will.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.150
Now then, Susie, I've
got some nice soft play.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.855
Would you like to come
and meet the others?

12:10.221 --> 12:12.501
There now, Susie,

12:12.526 --> 12:15.151
I must say, you look
like a right little diamond!

12:15.808 --> 12:17.432
I want to go to the toilet.

12:17.922 --> 12:20.119
Oh, right then. Off we go.

12:27.823 --> 12:30.252
Well done! Good girl!

12:32.937 --> 12:34.127
Just like the old days.

12:34.152 --> 12:36.619
- This is the last time.
- See you next week.

12:37.354 --> 12:39.666
- You suit those ribbons.
- Can I keep them?

12:40.564 --> 12:41.790
I don't see why not.

12:43.368 --> 12:45.148
I spent a week
working for Harpoons

12:45.173 --> 12:48.546
but, to be honest, I thought
their standards weren't that high.

12:48.571 --> 12:50.936
They were a bit imprecise,
which is deadly in this job.

12:51.696 --> 12:54.564
So I thought I'd go and work for
Beckindole's, best careers in town.

12:54.849 --> 12:56.859
I've got a clean
driving licence,

12:56.884 --> 12:59.040
so I can work the vans or
the bikes, whatever you want.

12:59.064 --> 13:00.814
Well, for a start,
you're not couriers.

13:01.204 --> 13:03.228
We call you lifestyle enhancers

13:03.618 --> 13:06.079
because you make people's
life feel better. Do you get it?

13:06.618 --> 13:09.509
- Yeah, works for me.
- Right, standard rules.

13:09.809 --> 13:11.138
50 pence a parcel.

13:11.380 --> 13:14.340
If any parcel takes longer
than 60 minutes to deliver

13:14.529 --> 13:15.684
you won't be paid.

13:15.868 --> 13:18.801
No holiday, no sick
pay, no argument.

13:18.926 --> 13:22.871
You'll pay Beckindole £1.50 a
day insurance if you're on the van,

13:23.216 --> 13:24.692
£1 if you're on the bike,

13:24.717 --> 13:27.043
and the £1 charge
applies even on days off.

13:28.301 --> 13:30.090
You're a bit
overqualified, aren't you?

13:30.115 --> 13:33.168
Oh, well, I suppose I've
wasted my time a little bit.

13:33.193 --> 13:35.673
Yeah, you're not the only one.
I've got tons of you these days.

13:35.739 --> 13:37.543
Neil, over there,
went to Oxford.

13:37.848 --> 13:39.145
Studied astrology.

13:39.511 --> 13:41.473
Doesn't help him cycle
any faster, does it?

13:41.503 --> 13:43.684
No, no, I don't suppose
it does, astronomy.

13:44.137 --> 13:45.285
But never mind.

13:45.808 --> 13:47.098
So what did you do before?

13:48.098 --> 13:50.160
Oh, banking.

13:50.316 --> 13:51.862
Oh, those bastards.

13:51.863 --> 13:53.253
I know, bastards.

13:53.679 --> 13:55.284
Look what they've done to us.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.402
I hated it, I'm glad to be out.

14:15.532 --> 14:16.829
So what do I do,
just pull the string?

14:16.853 --> 14:17.853
Mm-hm.

14:23.594 --> 14:26.167
You... you can't let school kids
have this. They'll be scarred!

14:26.192 --> 14:29.398
We trust them with knives and
forks. This is much the same.

14:31.846 --> 14:35.560
Not too hot, not too cold.
That's why they're calling it

14:35.585 --> 14:37.398
Goldilocks Clean Meat,

14:37.760 --> 14:39.062
completely artificial,

14:39.171 --> 14:40.710
grown in a laboratory.

14:41.515 --> 14:43.568
It's so far removed
from the original animal,

14:43.593 --> 14:45.187
they're saying
it's fit for vegans.

14:45.249 --> 14:46.881
Grown how? What
does it look like?

14:46.882 --> 14:48.893
They're called
bolts, bolts of meat.

14:48.894 --> 14:52.334
Like those things in
kebabs shops, but enormous.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.187
Well, I do love kebabs.

14:57.765 --> 15:00.694
- Damn.
- Injected with saltless salt.

15:01.194 --> 15:03.483
Oh, my God! It's delicious.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.001
That's bad news, that.

15:06.482 --> 15:08.185
Mm, God, it's nice, isn't it?

15:09.434 --> 15:12.107
They haven't cracked salad
yet. We still need staff for that.

15:12.184 --> 15:14.411
I've done the
sums. We need four.

15:14.559 --> 15:16.466
- Four people?
- Mm-hm, I think so.

15:16.861 --> 15:19.526
Well, I've got a staff of
ten, so who's going to go?

15:19.551 --> 15:21.904
Beverley. Who else?

15:22.441 --> 15:24.815
Rosie, I've got
to lose £200,000.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.783
It's the same every
time. The banks collapse,

15:26.808 --> 15:29.105
the government bails them
out, so they take money off us.

15:29.769 --> 15:32.136
I'm sorry, but six of the
catering staff will have to go.

15:33.011 --> 15:34.904
Including all managerial posts.

15:35.394 --> 15:37.596
But that's me. You mean me?

15:37.675 --> 15:40.204
The Goldilocks system
doesn't need skills at your level.

15:40.229 --> 15:41.298
I've got two kids.

15:41.323 --> 15:44.470
We need to restructure.
I can give you till Easter.

15:44.495 --> 15:47.214
That's plenty of notice for
you to have a look around

15:47.478 --> 15:49.175
and try other avenues.

15:59.206 --> 16:02.056
- Here come the dinner ladies!
- All right, girls?

16:02.081 --> 16:05.698
It's my big farewell, before I'm
replaced by a bolt of vegan meat.

16:05.825 --> 16:09.579
We've got food and booze and
music and it didn't cost me a penny

16:09.604 --> 16:11.656
cos it's my big, gay
brother's birthday.

16:11.681 --> 16:13.275
He's paying for the whole thing.

16:13.915 --> 16:15.862
- You'll like him, Eric!
- Whoo!

16:15.863 --> 16:16.874
Come on, then.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.851
- Hey, lads.
- Hi, Stephen.

16:18.876 --> 16:20.080
- Hey, how are you?
- All right?

16:20.104 --> 16:21.304
Thanks for coming.

16:22.093 --> 16:24.998
- This is really nice of you.
- Oh, well, it's my brother's idea.

16:25.023 --> 16:28.351
Yeah, that's him, over there.
Yeah, that's Dan, with the muscles.

16:28.714 --> 16:31.593
Yeah, he's 37 today, so he
said, "Let's have a blow out."

16:31.839 --> 16:34.459
Oh, this is the long-suffering.

16:34.484 --> 16:36.109
Celeste, this is Pete from work.

16:36.335 --> 16:39.021
That doesn't help. You've
got about five jobs. Which one?

16:39.374 --> 16:42.950
The couriers, yeah! Best
courier team in South Manchester.

16:42.975 --> 16:46.076
That's Stan and Alif
and Elaine and John.

16:46.271 --> 16:49.193
He works harder than anyone,
your husband. He puts us to shame.

16:49.302 --> 16:52.146
Oh, I'm doing three jobs myself,
but I bet he didn't mention that.

16:52.661 --> 16:55.845
We need the money! I'm the man
who lost a million quid, remember?

16:55.870 --> 16:57.177
How can we forget?

16:58.084 --> 16:59.124
We can try.

17:00.803 --> 17:03.387
Oh, brilliant. That's great.

17:03.412 --> 17:05.988
Oh, there's a perfect space at
the back. I want you to play loud.

17:06.012 --> 17:07.425
Oh, I can do loud.

17:07.451 --> 17:10.232
We did Glastonbury and
Ralph McTell complained.

17:10.645 --> 17:11.919
We're okay, aren't we?

17:12.449 --> 17:14.990
I mean this plan, it is
going to work, isn't it?

17:16.215 --> 17:18.826
I hope so. Fingers
crossed, yeah.

17:18.851 --> 17:21.012
Yeah, yeah, all right.

17:22.590 --> 17:23.590
All right.

17:26.098 --> 17:27.645
Oh, Lizzie, this
is my Auntie Edith,

17:27.670 --> 17:29.099
the one that works
for those charities.

17:29.123 --> 17:31.762
- Lizzie did that research for you.
- On Wytel Industries?

17:31.772 --> 17:34.090
Oh, yeah, thanks, Lizzie,
it really helped, thank you.

17:34.115 --> 17:35.902
It was for this
fundraising thing.

17:35.927 --> 17:38.558
They're going bust
now, Wytel, did you hear?

17:38.583 --> 17:41.786
There's some sort of big scandal.
It was on the news this morning.

17:42.063 --> 17:44.918
Oh, is that right?
Erm, actually I forgot...

17:44.943 --> 17:46.396
that thing. I'll see you later.

17:46.755 --> 17:48.794
Oh, it's so good of you to come.

17:48.989 --> 17:50.271
I've driven past this house.

17:50.296 --> 17:51.395
I always wondered
what it was like.

17:51.419 --> 17:54.355
Come on, have a look. Viktor
says hello and thank you.

17:54.380 --> 17:57.012
The work you did with
that petition was amazing.

17:57.037 --> 17:58.895
Dan's going a
bit nuts, isn't he?

17:58.920 --> 18:00.635
Just a little bit.

18:00.910 --> 18:03.110
His head's going to go Hong
Sha if he doesn't calm down.

18:03.293 --> 18:05.848
That's what they say
now, Hong Sha, kaboom.

18:06.387 --> 18:08.676
Do you remember
when Hong Sha went off?

18:09.090 --> 18:12.322
We all said, "Oh, the
whole world has changed."

18:12.792 --> 18:14.767
"Things will never be the same."

18:14.792 --> 18:16.714
Hardly gets mentioned any more.

18:17.285 --> 18:20.870
Well, except the consequences
of that ruined my entire life.

18:21.605 --> 18:22.792
I know, darling.

18:22.817 --> 18:25.449
Eric, you need lots of pepper.

18:25.488 --> 18:27.995
Coleslaw is all
about the pepper.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.831
You just brought
us here to work.

18:29.856 --> 18:31.081
Correct. Get on with it.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.405
Gran, why does my
signal keep cutting out?

18:34.506 --> 18:38.184
Oh, go on to Signor Two!
That works, for some reason.

18:38.209 --> 18:39.537
Thank you.

18:40.065 --> 18:41.936
So what's this new job of hers?

18:41.975 --> 18:43.358
Charity stuff.

18:43.467 --> 18:46.285
She used to help them out in the
field, and now she does in the cities.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.520
She goes into boardrooms
and asks them for money.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.762
It just seems so calm for Edith.

18:50.787 --> 18:55.465
She was always chaining herself
to railings and burning things down.

18:55.974 --> 18:58.349
I'm strangely disappointed.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.582
Lincoln likes
those little ribbons.

19:01.607 --> 19:02.748
It's not a problem, is it?

19:03.038 --> 19:04.740
He looks very pretty.

19:06.097 --> 19:08.479
<i>Well, I doubt that Wytel
knew what they were doing</i>

19:08.504 --> 19:10.692
<i>but the leaked
document spells it out.</i>

19:10.912 --> 19:14.581
<i>Wytel supplied equipment to
MBJM who sent it to Damascus,</i>

19:14.606 --> 19:17.840
<i>where it was used to build
Syria's concentration camps.</i>

19:17.881 --> 19:19.520
<i>And to return to the headlines.</i>

19:19.837 --> 19:22.707
<i>The Prime Minister has confirmed
the date of the general election</i>

19:22.892 --> 19:25.131
<i>as Thursday the 7th of May.</i>

19:25.520 --> 19:27.856
<i>We asked MPs for their reaction.</i>

19:28.247 --> 19:30.567
<i>I am delighted.</i>

19:30.774 --> 19:33.653
<i>At last, let the fight begin.</i>

19:34.418 --> 19:36.957
Right, food's up. We
have beef burgers,

19:36.982 --> 19:40.981
hot dogs, proper
sausages, veggie burgers,

19:41.006 --> 19:43.306
and this is the latest thing,

19:43.331 --> 19:45.086
it's orange burger,

19:45.087 --> 19:46.535
made out of orange peel.

19:49.004 --> 19:51.047
Those two, you don't think...?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.214
- Do you?
- I don't know.

19:54.315 --> 19:57.423
No. I think Beth's
just being 14.

19:57.448 --> 19:59.956
She was never 14, she's
just got a crush, that's all.

20:01.168 --> 20:02.237
However...

20:02.737 --> 20:04.658
Oh, my God, I thought so too.

20:04.683 --> 20:05.886
Do you know, I never
know with Edith?

20:05.910 --> 20:08.987
Trust me, she's
tried everything,

20:09.145 --> 20:10.682
all those years at sea.

20:20.306 --> 20:23.289
I tried telling my mum.
She doesn't understand.

20:23.314 --> 20:25.025
I mean, she won't understand.

20:25.415 --> 20:26.837
She refuses.

20:26.862 --> 20:29.562
My mum and dad, they're like,
haven't you grown out of that yet?

20:29.587 --> 20:31.390
I said, "Mum, you
should look online."

20:31.415 --> 20:32.454
"You should see
Richard Albright."

20:32.478 --> 20:34.461
He's got a wafer in his head.

20:34.486 --> 20:36.079
He can print his thoughts.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.048
Oh, my God.

20:39.276 --> 20:42.814
How far would you go,
Beth, to be trans-human?

20:43.986 --> 20:45.121
It's like,

20:45.567 --> 20:48.316
sometimes, I think my
lungs fill with up with air

20:48.341 --> 20:51.762
and it goes in and out like some
sort of bellows, and it feels so...

20:52.093 --> 20:53.355
thick.

20:54.332 --> 20:57.979
- We could be so much better than this.
- We could be free.

20:58.004 --> 21:01.675
We could be flying. We
should be wavelengths in the air.

21:02.847 --> 21:04.488
How much money have you got?

21:05.359 --> 21:06.359
Why?

21:07.018 --> 21:08.527
Tell me how much.

21:09.010 --> 21:11.293
My dad gave me
10,000 for my 18th.

21:11.318 --> 21:12.574
Even when we lost everything,

21:12.599 --> 21:14.871
he said, "That's
yours. Hold on to it!"

21:15.636 --> 21:16.949
Cos I did it, Beth.

21:17.835 --> 21:19.104
I contacted that woman.

21:19.129 --> 21:22.112
I spoke to her, I actually spoke to
her and she said we'd be perfect.

21:22.683 --> 21:23.871
Oh, my God.

21:24.026 --> 21:25.855
You could pay for us both.

21:27.596 --> 21:28.823
Would you do it?

21:28.947 --> 21:29.983
Would you?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.166
Woo!

21:39.424 --> 21:41.792
I want to see you all dancing.

21:41.885 --> 21:43.463

22:09.784 --> 22:13.509
♪ The bones are thrown and
Mama's path is shining bright ♪

22:26.447 --> 22:28.544
Thank you. Thank
you, isn't she amazing?

22:28.577 --> 22:30.533
Miss Fran Baxter, everyone.

22:33.568 --> 22:36.231
Er, OK, just a couple of things.

22:36.256 --> 22:38.387
Happy birthday to me, obviously.

22:38.903 --> 22:42.356
Don't start singing, not
yet, hold on. I'm 25 today.

22:42.381 --> 22:46.183
But first of all, I just
want to say thank you

22:46.208 --> 22:49.542
on behalf of someone who can't
be here tonight, Viktor Goraya.

22:49.567 --> 22:50.645
Oh, here we go.

22:50.670 --> 22:55.964
So many of you, well,
everyone, you've all been so kind.

22:55.989 --> 22:57.620
- He means you.
- I'm the best.

22:57.645 --> 22:59.737
I know it has been months
of worry and petitions,

22:59.762 --> 23:01.779
you all wrote letters and
things, you've all been amazing,

23:01.803 --> 23:05.809
but he was trapped in a country
that denies his existence...

23:06.776 --> 23:08.575
until Thursday night.

23:09.575 --> 23:12.869
Er, because Thursday
night Viktor left Odessa

23:12.894 --> 23:14.863
and he went to Ternopil.

23:14.888 --> 23:16.957
At midnight, he
got into a lorry, and

23:16.982 --> 23:19.432
they crossed the border
at Krakovets, successfully.

23:21.394 --> 23:24.924
Got into Poland, ten hours,
down through Germany,

23:24.949 --> 23:27.076
still too dangerous,
stopped near Stuttgart

23:27.077 --> 23:30.440
and they got from that
lorry into another lorry.

23:30.465 --> 23:31.738
Thanks, Siobhan.

23:32.093 --> 23:34.629
From there, through France.

23:36.793 --> 23:38.080
I know, I know, I know.

23:38.519 --> 23:40.744
Onwards, down to Spain.

23:43.550 --> 23:45.855
Thank you. He crossed the border

23:46.332 --> 23:48.581
and he did it, he got there.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.767
And that was today.

23:52.792 --> 23:55.987
And he's surrendered himself
to the Spanish authorities

23:56.012 --> 23:58.620
and they arrested him,
but that was the plan.

23:59.245 --> 24:03.917
Socialist Spain, they arrested
him, he applies for asylum,

24:04.245 --> 24:05.292
they won't deport him.

24:05.317 --> 24:08.518
What I'm saying
is, well, he did it.

24:09.839 --> 24:11.362
He's safe. He's there!

24:14.116 --> 24:17.448
I know this for a fact
because, because, because...

24:18.618 --> 24:19.752
Here he is!

24:59.799 --> 25:01.118
All right, thanks.

25:08.266 --> 25:13.133
My name is Daniel Lyons and I
have booked the conjugal suite.

25:13.999 --> 25:15.930
<i>Mi nombre es Daniel Lyons.</i>

25:16.154 --> 25:18.368
<i>Ha reservado la suite conyugal.</i>

25:18.473 --> 25:19.930
First door on the right.

25:22.586 --> 25:23.586
Thanks.

25:34.507 --> 25:35.671
There you are.

25:36.687 --> 25:37.687
Hey.

25:40.265 --> 25:41.742
Look at this room.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.617
God. Hello.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.484
Hi.

26:08.631 --> 26:10.694
So what they've
done now is this.

26:11.225 --> 26:13.395
Beckindole won't let me
drive across Manchester

26:13.420 --> 26:14.803
because of the
congestion charge,

26:14.828 --> 26:18.006
so I have to pick things up
from the depot on my bike,

26:18.303 --> 26:21.419
large or small, doesn't matter,
I have to carry them on my bike

26:21.444 --> 26:25.708
out of the congestion zone to a
designated Beckindole car park

26:25.733 --> 26:28.038
full of Beckindole vans.

26:28.092 --> 26:30.810
I'm not allowed to use my
own van, even if I had one,

26:30.835 --> 26:34.592
in case I build my own
business in my spare time,

26:34.853 --> 26:38.614
so I can only use Beckindole
vans, and I'm allocated one

26:38.639 --> 26:42.856
and I go to deliver my parcel,
leave my bike, God knows where,

26:42.881 --> 26:44.641
because I'm not allowed
to put it in the van.

26:45.232 --> 26:49.676
£7.60 an hour, except I only
get £3.90 because I'm new,

26:49.701 --> 26:51.114
so I'm classified
as an apprentice.

26:51.357 --> 26:53.044
So what are the five jobs?

26:53.568 --> 26:55.005
Celeste said you had five.

26:56.365 --> 27:00.177
Don't use her name.
Not here! That's not fair.

27:02.630 --> 27:06.615
Delivery, courier,
hospitality, pizza, and...

27:07.164 --> 27:11.154
Er, drug tests!
I'm a guinea pig.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.029
The gig economy, that's me.

27:15.286 --> 27:16.568
And what does she do?

27:18.410 --> 27:19.691
Book-keeping.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.332
She used to have a staff of 25,

27:24.629 --> 27:26.949
now she does the budgets
for local primary schools.

27:27.403 --> 27:28.817
She never complains.

27:30.070 --> 27:31.105
That pisses me off.

27:31.106 --> 27:35.559
I wish she would complain
but, no, I get this monument.

27:36.011 --> 27:37.762
But that house is enormous.

27:38.364 --> 27:40.926
Your gran's. You could
sell it, have 100,000 each!

27:40.951 --> 27:42.590
You could all sail
through the recession.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.350
Houses don't shift these days.
No-one's got any money to spend.

27:45.379 --> 27:46.598
You could try.

27:47.086 --> 27:49.067
The man who lost a million quid.

27:50.090 --> 27:52.659
I lost 20,000, which
might be nothing to you,

27:52.684 --> 27:54.308
but it's left me
stuck in this place.

27:55.002 --> 27:56.636
Know when you're lucky, Steve.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.675
Did you register this
address for the election?

28:00.480 --> 28:01.784
I never got round to it.

28:03.217 --> 28:04.448
But now you can't vote.

28:04.777 --> 28:05.831
What's it matter?

28:09.844 --> 28:11.300
Missed call.

28:11.947 --> 28:13.071
It's the wife.

28:13.221 --> 28:14.257
Stop it.

28:15.605 --> 28:17.300
Where's 0116?

28:17.515 --> 28:18.573
Leicester, I think.

29:30.548 --> 29:31.743
Hello, Signor.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.070
Family link override,
not Muriel, not Celeste.

29:36.071 --> 29:37.126
Thanks. Call.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.789
<i>Family link, Stephen calling.</i>

29:40.219 --> 29:42.844
OK. Hello. Funny time of day.

29:47.289 --> 29:49.539
Hey, can it wait? I'm a
little bit busy. Is it important?

29:49.766 --> 29:53.061
Hola, esta nueva
Danielo en Madrido.

29:53.062 --> 29:55.805
Hasta la vista,
paella, si, si, si.

29:56.383 --> 29:59.727
Er, OK, so I didn't
want to wait, so...

30:01.405 --> 30:02.608
are the kids there, Rosie?

30:02.633 --> 30:04.289
Er, no, why, what is it?

30:04.492 --> 30:07.039
Er, so I got a call, and erm...

30:08.565 --> 30:09.796
Dad's dead.

30:11.480 --> 30:12.508
No way.

30:14.182 --> 30:15.245
Are you kidding?

30:15.515 --> 30:16.984
No, seriously, it's for real.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.359
No, I made it up, I
thought it would be funny.

30:20.679 --> 30:21.905
<i>No, he's dead.</i>

30:22.213 --> 30:23.245
<i>He's gone.</i>

30:24.538 --> 30:26.507
Two days, she said, he's gone.

30:27.351 --> 30:29.092
Who did, Jacqueline?

30:29.499 --> 30:31.468
Yeah, yeah, she phoned me.

30:31.554 --> 30:33.687
Oh, my God, he was only 69.

30:35.804 --> 30:37.413
We never made
it to his birthday.

30:38.132 --> 30:39.476
So what happened?

30:40.317 --> 30:41.614
He was hit by a bike.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.100
Sorry!

30:43.351 --> 30:48.132
I mean, a bicycle. She said
he was hit by a Rideree bike.

30:48.835 --> 30:49.920
A bike?

30:50.669 --> 30:51.677
Killed him?

30:51.778 --> 30:53.092
Stephen, are you kidding us?

30:53.678 --> 30:55.087
<i>No, the bike didn't kill him.</i>

30:55.088 --> 30:57.193
The bike knocked him over

30:57.218 --> 31:03.037
and he had a scratch on
his hand, er, that was all.

31:03.233 --> 31:04.647
This is what Jacqueline said.

31:04.775 --> 31:09.043
Erm, he was fine,
he had a scratch,

31:09.068 --> 31:11.095
but that turned into
blood poisoning.

31:11.096 --> 31:13.600
Oh, my God. Sepsis.

31:13.766 --> 31:14.782
Yeah.

31:17.102 --> 31:18.890
And they tried
all the antibiotics,

31:18.915 --> 31:20.554
but they didn't
work any more, so...

31:23.588 --> 31:24.874
A scratch on his hand.

31:26.178 --> 31:27.842
He was hit by a bike?

31:28.569 --> 31:30.078
So they took him to hospital,

31:30.467 --> 31:32.124
one o'clock this afternoon...

31:33.993 --> 31:36.280
organ failure, and gone.

31:37.725 --> 31:40.123
- What was he delivering, the bike?
- Oh, Rosie, don't.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.560
I want to know.

31:41.671 --> 31:43.318
Actually I'd like to know.

31:43.498 --> 31:46.317
I mean, was he killed
by a chicken vindaloo?

31:46.342 --> 31:47.782
You know what?
You lot are horrible.

31:47.910 --> 31:50.404
No, he was horrible,
Danny. He was.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.928
<i>Oh, for God's sake.</i>

31:52.059 --> 31:54.074
He slept with someone
else and left us...

31:54.075 --> 31:56.078
is it really the worst
crime in the world?

31:56.079 --> 31:59.267
Yeah, and then he had a whole
second family with Jacqueline,

31:59.292 --> 32:00.579
and did he ever bother with us?

32:00.604 --> 32:02.438
And that's why, Rosie,

32:02.463 --> 32:04.501
because that's how you
spoke to him every time.

32:04.526 --> 32:07.549
You can't hate someone and
expect him to want to visit, can you?

32:07.612 --> 32:10.409
Oh, nice one, Danny. Now
you love him, now he's dead.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.073
Cut the link.

32:13.621 --> 32:15.601
That was a bit hard, Dan.

32:17.034 --> 32:18.074
What a mess.

32:19.706 --> 32:21.026
Hey, I'm sorry.

32:21.843 --> 32:22.971
Yeah, me too.

32:26.222 --> 32:27.258
And me.

32:31.819 --> 32:32.819
<i>You okay?</i>

32:34.748 --> 32:35.767
No.

33:07.783 --> 33:10.618
I'm right though, because
look at it from my point of view.

33:10.938 --> 33:15.040
Mum and Dad had Stephen,
fine, they had you, fine,

33:15.243 --> 33:17.585
they had Daniel, they
had a great, big, gay baby

33:17.610 --> 33:18.868
and they were still fine,

33:19.060 --> 33:20.657
then they had me
and Dad buggered off.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.500
If that's not my
fault then what is?

33:22.852 --> 33:24.422
But it's not your fault.

33:24.931 --> 33:28.524
I don't mean fault, I just mean
there I was and off he went.

33:28.782 --> 33:30.397
Maybe it was just bad timing.

33:30.422 --> 33:33.391
That's when he met Jacqueline,
just happened to be then.

33:33.501 --> 33:36.235
Jacqueline, I'll
never forget that...

33:36.260 --> 33:39.727
"Don't call me Jackie,
my name is Jacqueline."

33:41.993 --> 33:45.038
Which proves my point,
cos he wasn't a wanderer.

33:45.209 --> 33:47.449
He stayed with Jacqueline,
they had a son and everything.

33:47.623 --> 33:48.693
He was faithful,

33:49.381 --> 33:51.841
so the only time he wasn't
was when I came along.

33:53.895 --> 33:55.568
It's because he couldn't cope.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.826
I don't know, maybe.

33:59.008 --> 34:00.055
Definitely.

34:00.857 --> 34:02.537
Just too much of a coward.

34:05.005 --> 34:06.810
I just wish I'd asked him,

34:06.895 --> 34:09.050
but I never had anything
to say to him really.

34:09.074 --> 34:12.560
Whenever I saw him,
I'd just sit there and think,

34:13.168 --> 34:14.443
"What shall I say?"

34:15.788 --> 34:17.138
I had a lot to say.

34:18.206 --> 34:19.242
Too late now.

34:21.895 --> 34:23.097
His loss.

34:23.098 --> 34:24.481
Oh, that's the truth.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.473
I always say, Rosie,
shame on him.

34:29.815 --> 34:31.481
Shame on our father's head.

34:32.920 --> 34:33.925
Shame.

34:35.293 --> 34:36.902
<i>As the polls open,
it's being called</i>

34:36.928 --> 34:40.045

34:52.348 --> 34:54.125
<i>I'll probably tick

<i>Vivienne Rook has refused to

<i>But where will the

36:31.619 --> 36:34.139
<i>God help us.
We're the only ones.</i>

36:37.775 --> 36:38.775
Are you done?

36:38.800 --> 36:39.971
You left-wing hippie.

36:39.996 --> 36:41.578
This is nice, like the old days

36:41.603 --> 36:43.618
It's 100 quid if I get it
back before midnight.

36:44.094 --> 36:46.195
I love it, us lot in one car.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.282
We never do this. Should
have bought sweets.

36:48.932 --> 36:50.259
Leicester, here we come.

36:50.284 --> 36:51.829
I'm just making sure he's dead.

36:55.923 --> 36:57.593
Now you did vote, you two?

36:57.618 --> 36:59.065
Did it by post, last week.

36:59.066 --> 37:00.679
No-one goes and does
it by hand any more.

37:00.704 --> 37:02.312
Don't forget your passports.

37:02.337 --> 37:03.673
They're going to Scotland!

37:03.698 --> 37:05.853
Anything could
happen in this election.

37:05.878 --> 37:07.617
If your lot get into power,

37:07.642 --> 37:09.892
Scotland could be
divorced by midnight.

37:09.917 --> 37:11.360
Then they'll be stranded.

37:11.991 --> 37:14.142
Go, have a lovely time.

37:14.290 --> 37:17.334
Celebrate. It's your
grandad's funeral.

37:17.359 --> 37:19.096
This is a very fine day.

37:19.097 --> 37:20.727
Don't listen to her.

37:21.033 --> 37:22.336
Go and have fun.

37:23.057 --> 37:24.898
Edinburgh is beautiful.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.977
Bye, then. See you next week.

37:29.328 --> 37:30.445
Bye, darling.

37:31.734 --> 37:33.678
Oh, my God. They believed us.

37:33.703 --> 37:36.080
They'll understand. When
they see in ten days' time

37:36.081 --> 37:40.305
they'll be like, "Oh,
my God, that is infinite!"

37:42.117 --> 37:47.312
Destination Liverpool,
Imperial B&B, Shiel Road, L6.

37:47.337 --> 37:48.375
<i>Auto drive on.</i>

37:48.400 --> 37:50.055
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:52.243 --> 37:53.295
Bye!

38:14.492 --> 38:15.543
Hey, there.

38:15.568 --> 38:16.679
Hello.

38:16.906 --> 38:18.093
Thanks for coming.

38:18.540 --> 38:20.147
- Stephen.
- Steven.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.491
Killed by a bike.

38:23.088 --> 38:24.128
Shocking.

38:25.580 --> 38:26.967
Poor old Dad.

38:27.359 --> 38:30.803
Come for a drink after.
You're very welcome, all of you.

38:31.648 --> 38:34.217
I saw you on the
TV with the bomb.

38:36.288 --> 38:38.193
I'll see you later. Stephen.

38:38.351 --> 38:39.355
Steven.

38:44.810 --> 38:48.092
I still maintain it's not legal to
call two sons the same name.

38:48.318 --> 38:49.538
He's Steven with a V.

38:49.563 --> 38:52.100
Jacqueline chose Steven
with a V after her dad.

38:52.125 --> 38:53.428
You know that.

38:53.816 --> 38:54.816
Jacqueline.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.357
Doesn't feel like a brother.

38:57.821 --> 38:59.475
Half brother, if that.

39:00.465 --> 39:01.950
What does he do these days?

39:01.974 --> 39:03.333
He's a pharmacist.

39:03.923 --> 39:04.978
With a V.

39:05.755 --> 39:07.974
He's a varmacist!

39:10.755 --> 39:14.114
Oh, my God. This
isn't the crematorium.

39:14.688 --> 39:15.688
What do you mean?

39:15.713 --> 39:18.826
This place isn't a
crematorium, it's an aquatorium.

39:19.395 --> 39:23.787
They don't burn him,
he gets dissolved.

39:32.280 --> 39:34.232
Bethany Bisme-Lyons. Thank you.

39:35.950 --> 39:38.239
Lizzie Mbeko. Thank you.

39:38.264 --> 39:39.540
If you'd like to get on board

39:39.565 --> 39:41.419
we'll take you across
as soon as you are ready.

40:25.540 --> 40:29.487
It's called alkaline hydrolysis,
better for the environment.

40:29.879 --> 40:31.793
We were always green,
this side of the family.

40:32.148 --> 40:34.730
Uncle Ted was buried
in wicker, on a slope.

40:36.152 --> 40:37.738
So what do they do?

40:37.917 --> 40:40.523
Put the body in a big
tube, fill it with water,

40:40.548 --> 40:41.548
heat it up.

40:42.088 --> 40:43.088
They boil him?

40:43.437 --> 40:44.488
My God.

40:44.886 --> 40:47.409
Boil in the bag, like sous vide.

40:49.931 --> 40:51.339
Is it worse than burning?

40:52.503 --> 40:54.393
I mean it is, I know, but why?

40:55.259 --> 40:56.291
The eyes.

41:01.507 --> 41:04.151
You dissolve,
then you get rinsed.

41:04.810 --> 41:07.682
Then they pour
you out into a tub,

41:08.225 --> 41:10.753
you get flushed down the drain,

41:10.778 --> 41:11.817
out to sea...

41:13.041 --> 41:14.183
the end.

41:20.555 --> 41:24.493
<i>The Glenside facility
offers alkaline hydrolysis,</i>

41:24.494 --> 41:27.130
<i>the modern alternative
to burial or cremation.</i>

41:27.514 --> 41:30.223
<i>The remains of your loved
one are broken down into liquid...</i>

41:41.103 --> 41:43.119
Goodbye, Vince.

41:49.833 --> 41:51.700
I tell you what,
Jacqueline is true to form.

41:52.004 --> 41:53.489
No money behind the bar.

41:53.542 --> 41:54.755
Any news from the polls?

41:54.780 --> 41:56.334
They're not allowed
to say until ten o'clock.

41:56.358 --> 41:57.357
Low turnout though.

41:57.382 --> 42:00.004
See, it's like Viv Rook
says, people are too thick.

42:00.161 --> 42:04.160
So Steven with a V just
told me Dad didn't just work

42:04.185 --> 42:08.192
for that security firm, when he
was 55, he put some money in

42:08.217 --> 42:10.572
like 2,000 quid, like shares.

42:10.573 --> 42:12.572
Three years ago,
they sold the company,

42:12.573 --> 42:17.106
he got a pay-out, £75,000.

42:17.517 --> 42:19.454
- We get none of that.
- Nothing.

42:20.196 --> 42:21.360
Here's to Vince.

42:21.434 --> 42:22.899
Yeah, Dad.

42:22.924 --> 42:23.938
To Dad.

42:25.466 --> 42:29.016
Hi, you lot. Famalam. Stephen.

42:29.204 --> 42:31.501
Steven. We were
just toasting him.

42:32.119 --> 42:34.158
It's a nice little motor
out front, Stephen.

42:34.665 --> 42:36.212
Yeah, it is, Steven,
yeah, I like it.

42:36.324 --> 42:38.267
- 2.2 litre.
- Yeah.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.806
Well, you always
were very smart.

42:41.720 --> 42:45.485
Now, you've all
got one of these.

42:45.510 --> 42:48.110
It's just something
to remember him by.

42:50.289 --> 42:52.454
We should meet up some time.

42:52.594 --> 42:55.226
Go for dinner.
That would be nice.

42:56.481 --> 42:59.218
Hey, you were amazing
with that bomb, Edith.

42:59.765 --> 43:00.960
Are you all right now?

43:01.827 --> 43:03.918
Not really, no, I'm poisoned.

43:05.007 --> 43:09.443
Oh, well, that is
a thing, isn't it?

43:11.495 --> 43:14.526
Well, see you in a bit, Stephen.

43:14.551 --> 43:15.693
Steven.

43:20.492 --> 43:21.842
Oh, my God.

43:22.717 --> 43:25.147
- Daddy.
- That is weird.

43:25.172 --> 43:27.389
- Isn't that weird?
- Is that all that's left?

43:27.456 --> 43:28.709
He looks like tea.

43:29.378 --> 43:31.982
Weak tea. Is that all
we are in the end, tea?

43:32.492 --> 43:34.397
Just like scattering
the ashes, I suppose.

43:34.511 --> 43:35.920
Can't do this with ashes.

43:37.116 --> 43:38.641
- Cheers.
- Edith!

43:38.666 --> 43:39.977
- You can't do that!
- It's acid!

43:40.767 --> 43:41.867
It's alkaline.

43:42.711 --> 43:43.890
What's he taste like?

43:43.915 --> 43:45.437
- Soap.
- Soap.

43:45.696 --> 43:47.079
Like antiseptic gel.

43:47.485 --> 43:49.852
I can't believe
you just did that!

43:49.877 --> 43:51.055
It's my DNA.

43:51.444 --> 43:52.665
We are as one.

43:53.823 --> 43:55.196
Cheers, Jackie.

43:58.428 --> 44:00.250
Why didn't you come
home for Mum's funeral?

44:01.064 --> 44:02.111
Don't do that.

44:02.362 --> 44:03.555
Why not?

44:06.138 --> 44:07.735
I was stuck in Canada.

44:08.583 --> 44:09.647
Could have come home.

44:11.708 --> 44:12.771
I didn't want to.

44:13.264 --> 44:14.297
Why not?

44:16.459 --> 44:18.062
Because it was her funeral.

44:25.773 --> 44:28.257
I keep wondering whether
she'd be proud of me.

44:29.351 --> 44:30.968
Of course she would.

44:31.969 --> 44:33.996
No job, another
kid without his dad,

44:34.434 --> 44:35.609
I don't know if she would.

44:37.917 --> 44:40.560
She was tough, Edith.

44:40.585 --> 44:42.562
She wasn't just
nice, she was tough.

44:42.812 --> 44:46.929
And I wonder if she'd
think I was mad, with Viktor.

44:47.113 --> 44:49.524
I think she'd be ashamed,
some of the things I've done.

44:49.549 --> 44:51.164
You could never
do anything wrong.

44:51.569 --> 44:53.520
Oh, trust me.

44:54.564 --> 44:55.905
She'd kill me.

44:57.339 --> 44:59.030
If she knew, she'd kill me.

45:03.250 --> 45:06.084
All that stuff they say about
them looking down on you...

45:08.711 --> 45:09.881
I hope they don't.

45:33.669 --> 45:35.912
<i>Phone call, Bethany Bisme-Lyons.</i>

45:35.937 --> 45:38.771
- Oh, Signor, open on link.
- <i>Link open.</i>

45:39.527 --> 45:41.701
Hello, darling, how is it?

45:42.037 --> 45:43.088
Hoots, mon!

45:44.221 --> 45:45.409
Bethany?

45:45.810 --> 45:47.002
Can you hear me?

45:48.455 --> 45:49.659
Beth, are you all right?

45:51.555 --> 45:53.916
Can you help me, please?

45:54.318 --> 45:56.065
What is it, sweetheart?
What's wrong?

45:56.940 --> 45:58.354
I'm here, what is it?

45:58.666 --> 45:59.768
I'm sorry.

46:00.190 --> 46:01.861
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

46:03.243 --> 46:05.860
Whatever it is, I will
fix it, I promise you.

46:07.085 --> 46:08.173
Now, tell me.

46:09.566 --> 46:12.384
She's in Liverpool, not Scotland.
She's in bloody Liverpool.

46:12.673 --> 46:15.529
What for? What's she done?

46:15.554 --> 46:17.571
She won't say, God knows.

46:17.703 --> 46:18.977
I'll call Stephen.

46:19.002 --> 46:20.002
No.

46:22.017 --> 46:23.017
Please.

46:24.229 --> 46:26.525
Muriel, don't. She called me.

46:26.550 --> 46:27.550
Go.

46:39.517 --> 46:40.922
Just tell me what's happened.

46:41.395 --> 46:42.938
- I can't.
- Why not?

46:43.143 --> 46:44.272
You'll hate me.

46:44.297 --> 46:45.984
I could never hate you.

46:46.192 --> 46:47.196
Never.

47:05.789 --> 47:06.789
Oh...

47:10.648 --> 47:11.859
They won't tell me.

47:11.884 --> 47:13.351
All I've heard is crying.

47:13.376 --> 47:16.483
I did try, I said, "Let
me in," but they wouldn't.

47:16.508 --> 47:19.054
What are you doing in
Liverpool? Why did you lie?

47:19.079 --> 47:20.748
- It's the only place they do it.
- Do what?

47:20.772 --> 47:21.836
The operation.

47:22.050 --> 47:23.461
What operation?

47:29.214 --> 47:30.269
It's only my mum.

47:30.727 --> 47:33.078
- You promised me.
- It's okay.

47:33.103 --> 47:34.273
I'm here now.

47:34.792 --> 47:37.086
You have nothing to worry about.

47:39.278 --> 47:40.930
So what happened to your eye?

47:41.680 --> 47:42.680
Lizzie?

47:44.556 --> 47:45.750
Can you tell me?

47:45.941 --> 47:47.835
It's gone wrong,
but we can fix it.

47:47.860 --> 47:49.116
We just need to find them.

47:50.802 --> 47:52.069
Let me see.

47:53.417 --> 47:54.765
Let me see your eye.

48:00.244 --> 48:01.244
Okay.

48:01.889 --> 48:03.483
Well, that's not too bad.

48:04.185 --> 48:05.304
Hello, Lizzie.

48:05.604 --> 48:06.604
Hello.

48:06.857 --> 48:08.522
So what have you had done, hm?

48:09.190 --> 48:10.663
You daft things.

48:11.943 --> 48:13.976
You haven't had a face-lift,
have you, at your age?

48:15.874 --> 48:18.366
It's okay but there
is a lot of swelling,

48:18.391 --> 48:19.423
but that will calm down.

48:21.740 --> 48:22.740
What?

48:23.314 --> 48:25.037
I can't control it.

48:25.220 --> 48:26.267
What are you doing?

48:26.439 --> 48:27.818
It won't stay still.

48:27.843 --> 48:29.951
Lizzie, stop it,
what are you doing?

48:30.028 --> 48:31.326
I can't see.

48:32.178 --> 48:33.326
What is that?

48:35.239 --> 48:36.568
What have you done?

48:37.353 --> 48:39.271
- It's a camera.
- What?

48:39.420 --> 48:42.740
They promised us, they said
we could see, digital vision.

48:43.106 --> 48:45.161
But, but that's not her eye.

48:46.029 --> 48:47.693
What's happened to
her eye? Where is it?

48:47.718 --> 48:49.373
- They took it out.
- Who did?

48:49.398 --> 48:51.693
- The people on the boat.
- What boat?

48:51.732 --> 48:55.912
They said to me, "You're next,"
but I couldn't, I was too scared.

48:55.937 --> 48:57.678
I can't see with this eye.

48:57.920 --> 48:59.005
It's supposed to integrate,

48:59.030 --> 49:01.247
I'm supposed to see the
output in my head, but I can't.

49:01.329 --> 49:03.083
My eyesight's over there.

49:05.893 --> 49:06.893
Oh!

49:11.070 --> 49:12.101
Oh!

49:12.747 --> 49:13.942
Your mother's on the way.

49:14.140 --> 49:15.187
God, help.

49:15.212 --> 49:16.770
It's been going on for decades,

49:16.850 --> 49:20.114
cruise ships arrive at the docks
specially adapted as hospitals,

49:20.528 --> 49:23.372
run by Russians,
Slovakians, Romanians,

49:23.397 --> 49:25.989
and people go on board
for cheap operations.

49:26.014 --> 49:30.300
It was face-lifts in the '90s,
gender reassignment in the 2000s,

49:30.325 --> 49:33.121
and now they've
discovered transhumans.

49:33.146 --> 49:34.261
But they're breaking the law.

49:34.285 --> 49:37.933
This lot are. They're butchers.
But you try finding them.

49:37.958 --> 49:39.246
It's a great big ship.

49:39.271 --> 49:42.266
I mean, try finding the
owners, try suing them.

49:42.508 --> 49:44.958
There's a chain of ownership
bouncing round and round the world

49:44.982 --> 49:47.246
until you end up with
no-one and the ship sails on.

49:47.328 --> 49:50.394
And her eye, her real eye?

49:50.536 --> 49:52.590
Gone, junked.

49:54.187 --> 49:58.191
If you had 500,000, they say
there are grafts now to integrate

49:58.216 --> 50:00.199
the lens with the
optical nerve, but...

50:00.224 --> 50:03.023
not for kids like
that, in Liverpool.

50:03.705 --> 50:06.374
Somewhere there's a golden world
where these things are possible,

50:06.399 --> 50:07.780
but it's never here, is it?

50:11.260 --> 50:12.271
Call Stephen.

50:12.296 --> 50:14.350
<i>Calling Stephen Lyons.</i>

50:57.281 --> 50:58.551
See you later, Fran!

51:05.595 --> 51:07.552
- See you tonight, yeah?
- Yeah.

51:10.203 --> 51:12.638
<i>Stephen Lyons not answering.</i>

51:20.485 --> 51:21.557
Did you tell him?

51:23.251 --> 51:27.004
You gave away £10,000 and
your dad works every hour!

51:32.222 --> 51:34.973
Oh, to hell with
it. He can wait.

51:36.308 --> 51:38.113
Thank God you were scared,

51:38.138 --> 51:39.449
it saved you, Beth.

51:40.392 --> 51:42.320
It saved you.

52:00.275 --> 52:01.358
It's gone ten.

52:01.698 --> 52:05.144
<i>If the exit polls are correct,
this is an extraordinary result.</i>

52:05.300 --> 52:08.448
<i>We're seeing 288 seats
for the Conservatives,</i>

52:08.473 --> 52:10.769
<i>287 seats for Labour</i>

52:10.794 --> 52:15.065
<i>and an astonishing 15 seats for
Vivienne Rook's Four Star Party.</i>

52:15.090 --> 52:18.673
<i>That's 15 seats, leaving the balance
of power in the United Kingdom</i>

52:18.706 --> 52:21.515
<i>firmly in the hands
of Vivienne Rook.</i>

52:23.026 --> 52:28.183
<i>I will not... I will not form
a pact with the Tories,</i>

52:28.208 --> 52:30.814
<i>I will not form a
pact with Labour.</i>

52:31.104 --> 52:35.049
<i>Instead, for every vote in
the House of Commons,</i>

52:35.217 --> 52:37.275
<i>- they can come to me.
- Yeah!</i>

52:38.627 --> 52:43.775
<i>They can come to
me and I will decide.</i>

52:53.131 --> 52:54.580
Happy now, Rosie?

52:55.954 --> 52:57.009
Yeah.

52:57.166 --> 52:58.188
Hm.

53:00.205 --> 53:01.393
New world.

53:09.647 --> 53:11.048
Sorry!

53:50.242 --> 53:51.352
What are you doing?

54:23.485 --> 54:24.890
Hey, what are you doing?

54:25.257 --> 54:26.507
That's my bike!

55:07.303 --> 55:09.290
There she is, there she is!

55:09.674 --> 55:12.287
We need to get Viktor
out. He could be executed.

55:32.999 --> 55:36.911
Astonishing! Astonishing!
