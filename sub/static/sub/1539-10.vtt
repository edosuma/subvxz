12:22.250 --> 12:24.685
It was that Liza girl that betrayed him.

12:24.719 --> 12:27.421
Timing, Gabriel.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.356
Timing is everything.

12:29.390 --> 12:31.925
And Liza is a time bomb.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.627
Just...

12:33.661 --> 12:36.096
wait a while.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.498
Then watch and learn.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.936
Stay there in case he shows.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.871
Lovecraft isn't at home.
Housekeeper hasn't seen him

12:44.906 --> 12:46.873
since yesterday. Allen says he didn't

12:46.908 --> 12:48.642
come into his office. He
and Montoya are watching it.

12:48.676 --> 12:50.377
How did the killers know
where to find my witness?

12:50.411 --> 12:52.379
Let's keep calm here. It's a win.

12:52.413 --> 12:54.314
We've made Lovecraft panic.

12:54.349 --> 12:55.983
This is a panic move. A win?!

12:56.017 --> 12:57.417
There's two children out there with

12:57.452 --> 12:59.386
professional assassins coming after them.

12:59.420 --> 13:00.954
Bruce and Selina could end up dead.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.589
We're gonna get Lovecraft to call them off.

13:02.624 --> 13:05.158
How did they know?

13:05.193 --> 13:07.394
I never told you her name,

13:07.428 --> 13:08.996
let alone where she was hiding,

13:09.030 --> 13:11.131
so you couldn't have... I should say not.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.834
And you never mentioned my name

13:13.868 --> 13:15.135
to anyone, right?

13:15.169 --> 13:16.503
No, we agreed.

13:16.538 --> 13:17.938
I didn't mention any names out loud.

13:17.939 --> 13:20.641
No names "out loud"?

13:22.477 --> 13:23.777
What about whispering?

13:23.811 --> 13:25.312
Don't hold out on me.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.980
I'll know.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.851
For deep background, I leaked your name

13:30.885 --> 13:31.919
to a couple of select sources.

13:31.953 --> 13:33.153
I had to, for credibility!

13:33.187 --> 13:34.488
You're the Wayne murders cop.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.523
Damn it! That's how they got to her.

13:36.558 --> 13:39.626
I'm surprised it took
them this long to find her.

13:39.661 --> 13:41.128
This is on you, Dent! Whoa.

13:41.162 --> 13:42.296
I'll stipulate mea culpa.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.964
Kick my ass, be my guest.

13:43.998 --> 13:45.833
But let's find Lovecraft first

13:45.867 --> 13:47.935
and get him to call off the killers.

13:47.969 --> 13:50.938
He's not at home, he's not at his office.

13:50.972 --> 13:52.272
He could've left Gotham.

13:52.307 --> 13:53.841
Someone could be hiding him. Lovecraft...

13:53.875 --> 13:56.109
has got a couple of condos

13:56.144 --> 13:58.345
that he keeps under his mistress's name.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.215
One up in Stevensburgh and one, uh, uptown.

14:01.249 --> 14:03.884
I'll take the one uptown.

14:03.918 --> 14:06.587
If anything's happened to these kids...

14:15.263 --> 14:16.463
BULLOCK: We know you ran with a girl

14:16.498 --> 14:17.831
called Cat.

14:17.866 --> 14:19.233
She's in serious danger.

14:19.267 --> 14:20.634
Who isn't, right?

14:20.668 --> 14:22.035
Crazy world.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.505
How much?

14:29.377 --> 14:31.111
There's $100.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.883
All right, listen.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.917
I don't know where Cat lives, all right?

14:37.919 --> 14:39.353
She's... private

14:39.387 --> 14:41.488
about stuff like that.

14:41.523 --> 14:43.083
But... I heard that she got a new fence,

14:43.091 --> 14:44.191
'cause her old one got popped.

14:44.225 --> 14:45.592
He'd know where to find her.

14:45.627 --> 14:46.860
Who's the fence?

14:46.895 --> 14:48.495
I don't know.

14:48.530 --> 14:50.164
But I know who would know.

14:50.198 --> 14:52.433
Oh, yeah? Who's that?!

14:55.870 --> 14:57.371
Damn it, Alfred, save your cheese!

14:57.405 --> 14:58.939
I can beat the truth out of this kid

14:58.973 --> 15:00.240
with a roll of quarters!

15:00.275 --> 15:01.942
Yo, ask Fish Mooney.

15:01.976 --> 15:03.444
She runs

15:03.478 --> 15:04.978
all the fences.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.584
(gunshot)

15:16.157 --> 15:17.858
Forgive me for shocking you,

15:17.892 --> 15:21.195
but let me give you some context here.

15:21.229 --> 15:23.230
I loved Bannion.

15:23.264 --> 15:25.365
We came up together.

15:25.400 --> 15:29.103
But he was supposed to guard
the armory, and he didn't.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.872
And maybe, just maybe,

15:31.906 --> 15:34.208
he looked the other way.

15:34.242 --> 15:35.976
I don't know.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.580
So what do I do?

15:39.614 --> 15:40.881
Let it lie?

15:40.915 --> 15:42.116
Boss, we understand...

15:42.150 --> 15:43.383
FALCONE: Whoever else was involved

15:43.418 --> 15:46.487
will very soon wish

15:46.521 --> 15:49.590
they could die quickly, like Bannion.

15:49.624 --> 15:51.158
In the meantime,

15:51.192 --> 15:55.729
all of us must do what's
right for the family.

15:55.764 --> 15:58.799
Each of your tariffs will increase 25%

15:58.833 --> 16:01.235
until we've built the reserves again.

16:01.269 --> 16:03.637
No disrespect, that's high.

16:05.974 --> 16:07.441
A little bit.

16:07.475 --> 16:09.475
What do you think, Fish? Am I being fair?

16:11.346 --> 16:13.080
We're family.

16:13.114 --> 16:15.949
We sink or swim together.

16:15.984 --> 16:17.985
FALCONE: You could all learn from Fish.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.920
She trusts me.

16:19.954 --> 16:22.156
Trust me, and I'll trust you.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.158
It goes both ways.

16:25.994 --> 16:27.227
Let's eat.

16:42.177 --> 16:44.011
<i>BRUCE: There's a phone!</i>

16:44.045 --> 16:46.046
Come on!

16:49.317 --> 16:50.684
I don't... I don't carry coins.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.286
Do you have any coins?

16:52.320 --> 16:53.520
(sighs) Nope.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.622
Not a dime.

16:55.657 --> 16:56.990
Why does Alfred matter
so much to you anyway?

16:57.025 --> 16:58.025
He's just your butler.

16:58.026 --> 16:59.760
He's my family.

17:10.105 --> 17:12.205
Good luck, kid. See you around maybe.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.374
What?

17:13.407 --> 17:14.642
Wait! Look...

17:14.675 --> 17:16.877
those bad guys were there for me.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.712
Not you.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.681
You have nothing to worry about.

17:20.714 --> 17:21.915
Go home.

17:21.950 --> 17:23.250
But you said...

17:23.284 --> 17:25.204
I was just trying to freak you out.

17:25.954 --> 17:27.087
I was playing with you.

17:27.122 --> 17:29.990
You were playing with me?

17:30.025 --> 17:31.659
That's kind of cruel, isn't it?

17:31.693 --> 17:32.693
Yeah.

17:32.694 --> 17:33.894
No, look,

17:33.928 --> 17:35.362
you're right about me.

17:35.397 --> 17:36.597
I'm not nice.

17:36.631 --> 17:38.766
Not like you.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.234
You got a nice way about you.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.670
"A nice way"? Yeah. That's why

17:42.704 --> 17:44.505
I said that thing about
you being the target,

17:44.539 --> 17:47.808
so, you know, we could
hang out a while longer.

17:51.046 --> 17:53.580
I see.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.349
It's very convoluted reasoning.

17:55.383 --> 17:57.751
Whatever.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.520
Anyhow, it's been cool.

17:59.554 --> 18:01.622
I'm gonna disappear. But you can't do that!

18:01.656 --> 18:03.223
I wasn't asking. You can't disappear!

18:03.258 --> 18:04.618
You have to come back home with me.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.894
When Detective Gordon finds the man

18:06.928 --> 18:09.063
who killed my parents, you have to testify.

18:09.097 --> 18:12.666
You really think that
was ever going to happen?

18:14.002 --> 18:16.136
Grow up, B.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.768
♪ ♪

18:53.174 --> 18:55.376
No, don't! You won't make it!

19:12.427 --> 19:13.947
(gasping): Help.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.533
You're crazy.

19:19.568 --> 19:20.801
Please don't run off again.

19:20.835 --> 19:21.969
I'm out of breath.

19:22.003 --> 19:25.105
Okay, kiddo.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.507
You earned it.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.475
You want to hang with me, that's cool,

19:28.510 --> 19:29.977
but my world, my rules.

19:30.011 --> 19:31.245
You do what I say.

19:32.314 --> 19:34.181
Yes, ma'am.

19:44.036 --> 19:45.670
Why can't I call Alfred

19:45.704 --> 19:47.371
or Detective Gordon to
let them know I'm okay?

19:47.406 --> 19:48.639
Because we're disappearing.

19:48.674 --> 19:51.075
You got to be like smoke.

19:53.045 --> 19:55.525
Smoke doesn't make phone calls.

20:03.255 --> 20:05.556
What is this place? The Flea.

20:05.591 --> 20:07.024
It's like the mall for street kids,

20:07.059 --> 20:08.326
without the crappy music.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.840
We'll be safe here till dark.

20:17.603 --> 20:19.503
Falcone's making me nervous.

20:19.538 --> 20:21.839
If he suspects it was
us who blew up his money,

20:21.874 --> 20:23.608
why hasn't he made a move?

20:23.642 --> 20:25.409
'Cause he can't be sure.

20:25.444 --> 20:28.045
There are ten other people
who could have done this.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.081
So what now?

20:30.115 --> 20:32.049
You're going to stick to the plan.

20:32.084 --> 20:34.018
You're gonna reach out
to Saviano and Turski.

20:34.052 --> 20:35.586
They are both very angry

20:35.621 --> 20:37.288
that their taxes have been raised,

20:37.322 --> 20:39.957
and they're worried about
ending up like Bannion.

20:39.992 --> 20:42.293
They're ready. The old man

20:42.327 --> 20:43.861
is herding his sheep toward me.

20:43.896 --> 20:45.563
You got it, boss.

20:45.597 --> 20:48.633
All right.

20:52.437 --> 20:54.438
(indistinct chatter nearby)

20:55.908 --> 20:57.875
Hello, gentlemen.

21:00.078 --> 21:02.046
Busy day, Harvey. Come back next year.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.548
BULLOCK: Hand to God, Butch,

21:03.582 --> 21:06.250
I'll be quicker than a
sailor on shore leave.

21:06.285 --> 21:07.652
Thief we're tracking down.

21:07.686 --> 21:09.287
Look familiar? Goes by "Cat."

21:09.321 --> 21:10.421
Nope.

21:10.455 --> 21:11.756
BULLOCK: Maybe Fish knows her.

21:11.790 --> 21:13.157
GILZEAN: Fish knows everyone.

21:13.192 --> 21:14.292
Fish is busy.

21:14.326 --> 21:15.326
She works with one of

21:15.327 --> 21:16.407
your fences, a new guy.

21:16.428 --> 21:17.962
What's a fence?

21:17.996 --> 21:19.897
Come on, Butch. Be nice.

21:19.932 --> 21:21.399
This is important.

21:21.433 --> 21:22.433
Where's Fish?

21:22.467 --> 21:25.069
I told you, she's busy.

21:25.103 --> 21:26.504
I once knew a fella

21:26.538 --> 21:27.805
called Butch.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.608
Yeah, he was a Whitechapel lad.

21:30.642 --> 21:33.244
Now, we called him Butch,
you see, 'cause he wasn't.

21:33.278 --> 21:35.179
It was a wind-up.

21:35.214 --> 21:37.014
It was like a joke name.

21:37.049 --> 21:39.089
In fact, he was a horrible little toe rag.

21:39.117 --> 21:40.418
GILZEAN: What?

21:40.452 --> 21:42.353
I can't tell. Are-are you...
are you threatening me?

21:42.387 --> 21:44.867
Is he threatening me?

21:45.891 --> 21:47.825
Yeah?

21:47.860 --> 21:49.360
You can't... (grunts)

21:49.394 --> 21:50.828
Now...

21:50.863 --> 21:53.498
where is this Fish?

21:54.466 --> 21:55.666
Right here.

21:58.070 --> 22:00.605
So... what's the fuss?

22:00.639 --> 22:03.174
They're just fooling around.

22:03.208 --> 22:06.210
We're looking for this girl,

22:06.245 --> 22:09.881
a street thief, goes by Cat,
works with one of your fences.

22:09.915 --> 22:12.683
Looks familiar. What's the urgency?

22:12.718 --> 22:14.619
Professional killers are looking for her.

22:14.653 --> 22:16.387
Professionals, huh?

22:16.421 --> 22:18.890
This wouldn't be the Lovecraft
witness, now would it?

22:18.924 --> 22:20.558
How'd you know?

22:20.592 --> 22:22.126
Streets talk.

22:22.161 --> 22:24.328
Using her to scare Lovecraft.

22:24.363 --> 22:26.130
She saw the Waynes' killer,

22:26.165 --> 22:27.565
supposedly.

22:27.599 --> 22:28.533
Yeah. Mm...

22:28.567 --> 22:29.867
(chuckles)

22:29.902 --> 22:32.003
And you're here because you want me

22:32.037 --> 22:34.572
to help you find her, don't you?

22:34.606 --> 22:35.873
Yes.

22:35.908 --> 22:37.408
Harvey...

22:37.443 --> 22:38.910
(laughs)

22:38.944 --> 22:41.045
Why in the world

22:41.080 --> 22:42.980
would I help you find her,

22:43.015 --> 22:44.816
of all people?

22:44.850 --> 22:47.852
She has Bruce Wayne with her, miss.

22:47.886 --> 22:49.554
Really?

22:49.588 --> 22:51.823
Yes, miss.

22:51.857 --> 22:55.093
I'm Alfred Pennyworth. I'm
the boy's legal guardian.

22:55.127 --> 22:57.495
Very pleased to meet you. Likewise.

22:57.529 --> 22:58.896
Miss Mooney, we need your help.

22:58.931 --> 22:59.931
Well, you see, Alfred,

22:59.965 --> 23:01.599
I would love to help you,

23:01.633 --> 23:04.235
but it would infringe
upon my personal interests.

23:04.269 --> 23:06.237
And why would I do that?

23:06.271 --> 23:10.775
You have a very eloquent... gaze,

23:10.809 --> 23:12.510
if I may say so, Miss Mooney.

23:12.544 --> 23:16.447
And I can see that you're
not a woman that would

23:16.482 --> 23:21.619
let petty self-interest outweigh... honor.

23:21.653 --> 23:23.821
And compassion.

23:28.961 --> 23:30.428
I'll make some calls.

23:32.097 --> 23:34.665
But remember this kindness.

23:40.739 --> 23:42.907
(rock music playing)

23:42.941 --> 23:44.308
Much better.

23:44.343 --> 23:47.045
Really?

23:47.079 --> 23:48.546
I'm not sure.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.981
You look badass.

23:50.015 --> 23:51.616
No lie.

23:51.650 --> 23:54.152
IVY: Hey, Cat.

23:54.186 --> 23:55.887
Ivy...

23:55.921 --> 23:57.588
what are you doing here?

23:57.623 --> 23:59.791
What have you been up to? I thought...

23:59.825 --> 24:01.626
Yeah, Juvie caught me.

24:01.660 --> 24:02.960
I got adopted upstate.

24:02.995 --> 24:03.995
Didn't take?

24:04.029 --> 24:05.430
Good people... they wanted me

24:05.464 --> 24:07.465
to cut my hair, dress nice.

24:07.499 --> 24:09.233
I know you.

24:09.268 --> 24:11.402
You're Mario Pepper's daughter.

24:11.437 --> 24:13.204
Yes. Who are you?

24:14.707 --> 24:15.940
I'm Bruce Wayne.

24:17.376 --> 24:18.910
IVY: Yes, you are.

24:18.944 --> 24:20.278
Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

24:20.312 --> 24:22.280
Stay cool now, Ivy.

24:22.314 --> 24:24.282
I am cool. Why are you telling me that?

24:24.316 --> 24:25.416
Why are you telling me what to do?

24:25.451 --> 24:27.085
I'm not. I'm just saying,

24:27.119 --> 24:28.786
I don't want you to get mad at him.

24:28.821 --> 24:30.188
He's a friend.

24:30.222 --> 24:31.302
Why would I get mad at him?

24:31.323 --> 24:32.323
It's not his fault, is it?

24:32.358 --> 24:34.525
Did you kill my father?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.094
Do you make my mother cut her wrists?

24:36.128 --> 24:37.595
No.

24:37.629 --> 24:39.697
IVY: Somebody did... somebody did,

24:39.732 --> 24:40.999
but not him.

24:41.033 --> 24:43.001
How you doing? You doing okay?

24:43.035 --> 24:45.703
I'm okay. And you?

24:45.738 --> 24:47.939
I'm doing great. How do I look?

24:47.973 --> 24:51.175
You look good.

24:51.210 --> 24:52.343
Have you seen Clyde the fence around?

24:52.378 --> 24:53.645
Yeah, he's working

24:53.679 --> 24:55.813
out of the Factory on the Narrows.

24:55.848 --> 24:56.948
He's cute, isn't he?

24:56.982 --> 24:58.883
Yes, he is. Uh, thanks, Ivy.

24:58.917 --> 25:01.786
Good to see you. Uh, we
got to go run and see Clyde.

25:01.820 --> 25:04.689
Oh. Okay, fine. Bye, then.

25:04.723 --> 25:06.391
Keep moving.

25:06.425 --> 25:08.359
She's just a little girl.

25:08.394 --> 25:09.961
Why are you so scared of her?

25:09.995 --> 25:12.475
Because she's scary. Don't look back.

25:38.958 --> 25:40.425
GCPD!

25:40.459 --> 25:42.093
Drop it.

25:44.229 --> 25:46.097
Kick it over.

25:51.103 --> 25:54.272
You're under arrest.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

25:54.306 --> 25:55.940
Murder? Me, murder?

25:55.975 --> 25:58.009
Look, what are you talking about?

25:58.043 --> 26:00.044
You put a hit out on Selina Kyle.

26:00.079 --> 26:01.713
No, not me.

26:01.747 --> 26:04.215
The same people that came
after her came after me, too.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.384
Th-They attacked me on the street.

26:06.418 --> 26:07.719
Why do you think I'm hiding in here?

26:07.753 --> 26:09.120
Why would they come after you?

26:09.154 --> 26:10.154
Why do they ever come?

26:10.155 --> 26:11.589
Because I know too much.

26:11.624 --> 26:14.459
Cut the crap. Who are you so scared of?

26:14.493 --> 26:16.027
You have no idea, do you?

26:16.061 --> 26:17.595
You think I'm the big wheel.

26:17.630 --> 26:19.197
When it comes to the crunch, kid,

26:19.231 --> 26:22.300
I'm nobody, just like you.

26:22.334 --> 26:24.102
A-And the people

26:24.136 --> 26:26.070
who really, truly run this city,

26:26.105 --> 26:27.972
they're watching you huff and
puff and run around crusading,

26:28.007 --> 26:29.474
and they are laughing at you.

26:29.508 --> 26:30.808
You're so deep in the maze,

26:30.843 --> 26:32.577
you can't see over the wall.

26:32.611 --> 26:34.445
Tell me something I don't know.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.981
My briefcase, under the bed. Files.

26:37.016 --> 26:39.117
Go.

26:39.151 --> 26:42.954
Right before the Waynes got killed,

26:42.988 --> 26:45.490
there was a run on Wayne Enterprises stock.

26:45.524 --> 26:47.792
Like somebody knew something
bad was gonna happen.

26:47.826 --> 26:49.994
So I figured I deserved a cut.

26:50.029 --> 26:51.896
So I started digging.

26:51.931 --> 26:53.097
(door thumps, creaks)

27:07.346 --> 27:09.614
I've come for that man.

27:09.648 --> 27:12.016
You need not get hurt.

27:30.035 --> 27:32.403
(grunting)

27:52.324 --> 27:56.227
Mm... that was nice.

27:56.262 --> 27:58.663
Let's do it again sometime.

28:10.377 --> 28:13.780
(cell phone ringing)

28:18.685 --> 28:20.753
Yeah?

28:20.788 --> 28:22.522
Fish got a lead on the kids,

28:22.556 --> 28:24.757
at a place on the Narrows
called The Factory.

28:24.792 --> 28:26.826
Word is, Cat used a fence named Clyde.

28:26.860 --> 28:29.095
He hangs there. We're on our way now.

28:29.129 --> 28:31.864
Alfred, let's go.

28:31.899 --> 28:33.800
Fish, thank you.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.435
You owe me.

28:35.469 --> 28:38.004
Who don't I owe?

28:40.240 --> 28:41.574
Mr. Lovecraft?

29:03.097 --> 29:05.064
No, no, no, no, no.

29:05.099 --> 29:06.799
This is Detective Gordon.

29:06.834 --> 29:09.602
Badge number
23-16-11.

29:09.637 --> 29:12.739
Reporting body at 1257 Antioch.

29:23.083 --> 29:26.619
Cat! My baby!

29:26.654 --> 29:29.355
Hey, Clyde. Well...

29:29.390 --> 29:30.823
what have you got for me?

29:33.360 --> 29:35.161
Hey! Shh!

29:35.195 --> 29:37.297
Wow.

29:37.331 --> 29:39.499
Sweet swag.

29:39.533 --> 29:41.034
Not your usual junk.

29:41.068 --> 29:42.735
SELINA: Moving on up.

29:45.539 --> 29:47.373
Where'd you get this?

29:47.408 --> 29:48.975
You want a story or the swag?

29:49.009 --> 29:50.543
How much?

29:50.577 --> 29:51.778
Thousand bucks.

29:51.812 --> 29:53.680
(laughing)

29:53.714 --> 29:56.683
Please. Give me a break.

29:56.717 --> 29:58.637
That's rock-bottom, you know it is.

30:00.487 --> 30:01.788
Fifty bucks.

30:01.822 --> 30:02.822
Fifty?

30:02.823 --> 30:04.557
This pen is real gold,

30:04.591 --> 30:05.992
and that's an antique jade netsuke.

30:06.026 --> 30:08.328
It's worth $2,000 on its own.

30:08.362 --> 30:12.999
And who is this
well-spoken little... dude?

30:13.033 --> 30:14.300
Never mind who he is.

30:14.335 --> 30:17.337
Look, 500 is rock-bottom.

30:17.371 --> 30:19.038
Why are you wasting my time?

30:19.073 --> 30:21.908
Relax.

30:21.942 --> 30:25.111
I'm sure we can... make a deal.

30:28.182 --> 30:30.817
No, thanks. We'll go elsewhere.

30:30.851 --> 30:34.220
Cool down, Cat.

30:35.956 --> 30:38.992
Or we'll poke your
little friend's eyes out.

30:39.026 --> 30:40.760
That's it.

30:40.794 --> 30:43.496
Relax.

30:43.530 --> 30:47.166
I've got some friends coming over

She's gone.

Some advice, kid:

35:55.052 --> 35:58.254
don't ever mistake bravery for good sense.

36:00.290 --> 36:02.625
(gun cocks)

36:09.733 --> 36:11.300
Alfred.

36:13.837 --> 36:16.572
Fancy seeing you here.

36:16.606 --> 36:18.474
You all right?

36:18.508 --> 36:20.543
I'm fine.

36:20.577 --> 36:22.578
How are you?

36:30.420 --> 36:32.488
You really scared me, Master Bruce.

36:33.957 --> 36:36.926
If you die...

36:36.960 --> 36:38.995
who employs butlers anymore?

36:57.481 --> 36:59.548
Oh, thank God.

37:08.528 --> 37:13.031
JAMES: Lovecraft was a beloved
pillar of this community.

37:13.066 --> 37:15.501
A dedicated servant of Gotham.

37:15.535 --> 37:18.237
So, what do I tell the media, huh?

37:18.271 --> 37:19.738
Hmm?!

37:19.772 --> 37:21.240
Any ideas?

37:21.274 --> 37:22.875
He was a crook.

37:22.909 --> 37:24.676
We nearly had him.

37:24.711 --> 37:26.712
And he was killed by whoever
he would have implicated

37:26.746 --> 37:28.514
if he had lived to testify.

37:28.548 --> 37:30.182
Say that.

37:30.216 --> 37:33.352
Forgive me if I can't
get behind your approach.

37:33.386 --> 37:34.453
It was your gun.

37:34.487 --> 37:36.054
I didn't kill him.

37:36.089 --> 37:38.089
On balance, I believe you... on balance.

37:39.759 --> 37:41.126
But suicide is much cleaner...

37:41.161 --> 37:42.594
It wasn't suicide, it was murder!

37:42.629 --> 37:43.929
It was suicide!

37:43.963 --> 37:45.464
He went mad

37:45.498 --> 37:46.598
under your relentless questioning,

37:46.633 --> 37:48.133
overpowered you

37:48.168 --> 37:50.369
and killed himself with your gun.

37:50.403 --> 37:52.571
And don't tell me otherwise.

37:56.109 --> 37:57.843
What do you say, counselor?

38:02.582 --> 38:04.550
I'm at your disposal, Mayor James.

38:04.584 --> 38:07.152
I'm sorry if we've caused you any disquiet.

38:07.187 --> 38:09.822
"Disquiet."

38:09.856 --> 38:12.057
You arrogant clowns.

38:12.091 --> 38:16.962
You're hacking away at the
very foundations of this city.

38:16.996 --> 38:19.631
Trying to take me down!

38:19.666 --> 38:21.667
Should have the both
of you stuffed in a sack

38:21.701 --> 38:23.335
and thrown in the river.

38:25.338 --> 38:28.073
But I can't do that.

38:28.108 --> 38:30.409
Two scapegoats would look like panic.

38:30.443 --> 38:32.778
But one of you is going
down, mark my words.

38:32.812 --> 38:34.146
Sir, that's not right.

38:34.180 --> 38:36.348
Hush.

38:36.382 --> 38:38.117
It's not you, Dent.

38:38.151 --> 38:41.787
Obviously, it's Mr. Gordon.

38:41.821 --> 38:43.021
Sir, I protest.

38:43.056 --> 38:44.423
But not too much.

38:44.457 --> 38:46.937
You see, Counselor Dent

38:46.960 --> 38:49.995
knows how to walk the line.

38:51.865 --> 38:53.332
He knows where the edge is.

38:55.235 --> 38:56.869
You, Mr. Gordon,

38:56.903 --> 38:59.638
do not know where the edge is.

39:06.646 --> 39:08.380
Mayor James.

39:11.251 --> 39:13.585
Kiss my ass.

39:20.427 --> 39:25.397
Dick Lovecraft's suicide is
a terrible, terrible tragedy.

39:25.432 --> 39:27.866
Fighting the trumped-up charges

39:27.901 --> 39:31.570
of an overzealous police
officer was too much for him.

39:33.173 --> 39:36.308
You have my word, Dick.

39:36.342 --> 39:38.343
This officer is being dealt with.

39:40.213 --> 39:42.247
Arkham Asylum?

39:42.282 --> 39:44.316
A security guard for nut-jobs?

39:44.350 --> 39:46.018
Criminal nut-jobs, yeah.

39:46.052 --> 39:48.020
Are you taking the assignment?

39:48.054 --> 39:49.521
It's that or quit.

39:49.556 --> 39:50.656
So quit.

39:50.690 --> 39:52.391
That's what they want me to do.

39:52.425 --> 39:55.694
Damn, Jim.

39:55.729 --> 39:57.229
Whoever your next partner is,

39:57.263 --> 39:59.698
he or she will be a lot easier than me.

40:01.234 --> 40:03.035
Ed.

40:03.069 --> 40:05.738
Detective Gordon, I hear you've
been thrown out in disgrace.

40:05.772 --> 40:06.772
Is this true?

40:06.773 --> 40:08.006
Yeah, it is.

40:08.041 --> 40:10.376
I'm gonna write a letter to the boss.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.077
You do that.

40:12.112 --> 40:13.912
Which boss should I write to?

40:15.081 --> 40:16.882
Forget it, Ed.

40:16.916 --> 40:18.884
That's the breaks, huh?

40:18.918 --> 40:19.918
You take care.

40:27.093 --> 40:28.894
Maybe you should take him with you.

40:28.928 --> 40:30.629
You'd miss him if he was gone.

40:30.664 --> 40:32.898
No, I wouldn't.

40:32.932 --> 40:34.767
Let me buy you a drink sometime.

40:37.804 --> 40:39.138
Soon.

40:59.793 --> 41:02.261
SELINA: Your security still sucks.

41:05.031 --> 41:07.132
No one's hunting for me.

41:09.169 --> 41:12.137
I didn't expect to see you again.

41:12.172 --> 41:14.673
Never said good-bye.

41:14.708 --> 41:17.076
No, we didn't.

41:17.110 --> 41:19.445
Didn't want to be rude.

41:21.481 --> 41:23.115
It-it's good to see you.

41:23.149 --> 41:24.883
Here.

41:42.068 --> 41:44.837
Thank you, but you could keep this.

41:44.871 --> 41:46.372
You need it more than I do.

41:46.406 --> 41:50.175
Nah, let's keep things honest between us.

41:50.210 --> 41:52.678
I'm keeping this one anyway.

42:04.491 --> 42:06.025
(knocking)

42:06.059 --> 42:07.660
(door opens)

42:09.829 --> 42:12.231
Having a little chat, Master Bruce?

42:14.367 --> 42:16.335
Thinking out loud.

42:16.369 --> 42:18.170
Right.

42:18.204 --> 42:19.405
Right.

42:19.439 --> 42:21.674
Of course you were.

42:28.214 --> 42:30.716
Shall I take that for you?

42:38.458 --> 42:41.327
The old house seems very quiet...

42:41.361 --> 42:42.828
without her, doesn't it?

42:42.862 --> 42:45.264
Yes, it does.
