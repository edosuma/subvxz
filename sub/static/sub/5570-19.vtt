WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:05.173
Previously on Limitless...
My name's Sands.
I'm your new boss.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.274
The woman who tried
to shoot Mr. Morra

00:06.307 --> 00:08.042
is Piper Baird.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.411
If the FBI finds this woman
before we do, she can tie

00:10.444 --> 00:13.214
the senator to NZT,
which means...

00:13.247 --> 00:14.515
No more booster shots.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.749
SANDS:
We got a DNA sample.

00:15.783 --> 00:16.817
It was Piper Baird

00:16.850 --> 00:18.719
on those tracks.
I killed her.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.289
When all of this started,
we made promises to each other.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.291
I know.
I didn't mean to lie to you.
You're being assigned

00:23.324 --> 00:24.292
to a different handler.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.126
I told you to leave Russia.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.195
(grunts)
NAZ:
If D.C. finds out

00:27.228 --> 00:28.662
that Brian brought NZT

00:28.696 --> 00:30.331
into Russia, this becomes

00:30.364 --> 00:32.333
an entirely different kind
of manhunt.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.402
If Morra ever finds out
that you are still alive,

00:34.435 --> 00:37.538
then everything that means
anything to me is gone.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.307
You can't play both sides
forever.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.475
I'm gonna figure out
how that enzyme works, Brian.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.644
You can be free
of Morra for good.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.646
SANDS:
Piper's alive.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.753
*

00:52.786 --> 00:56.124
BRIAN: So, you may be wondering
how I got here.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.658
I understand now
that going to Russia

00:57.691 --> 01:00.461
without letting you guys know
was the wrong thing to do.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.197
But I... just needed
a break, you know?

01:03.231 --> 01:07.401
I needed a vacation
to clear my head, and, uh...

01:07.435 --> 01:09.337
And now that you're back, there
are going to be several changes

01:09.370 --> 01:11.672
to your agreement
with the Bureau.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.242
*

01:18.346 --> 01:20.881
We will be moving you out
of the file room to a cubicle

01:20.914 --> 01:22.216
where I can keep an eye on you.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.155
To prevent you
hoarding pills,

01:27.188 --> 01:29.157
your NZT dosage
will be monitored

01:29.190 --> 01:30.391
with more vigilance.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.260
Meaning...

01:32.293 --> 01:34.728
*

01:34.762 --> 01:37.331
Meaning we're going
to make sure you swallow.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.233
*

01:40.468 --> 01:42.703
You will be subject
to random drug testing.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.439
You know what I mean.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.175
Let it... let it go.
Let it go.
Finch.

01:47.208 --> 01:50.178
Finch, let it go.
Let it...

01:50.211 --> 01:51.912
Random searches
of the safe house.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.415
Monitoring all your
communication activities.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.450
(coughs):
Patriot Act.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.218
Excuse me?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.254
You will have
a 10:00 p.m. curfew.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.789
What?
Which will be enforced

02:01.822 --> 02:03.224
by new escorts.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.692
Dedicated agents

02:04.725 --> 02:07.428
will accompany you
from home to office.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.697
What about when I'm off-duty?
24/7.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.166
And they've been warned
about your tendency to wander.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.202
How you doing? Brian.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.606
Going forward,
you will not discuss NZT

02:18.639 --> 02:21.775
or your work here
with anyone outside of the CJC.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.377
What about my family?

02:23.411 --> 02:24.278
Period.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.347
Got it. Mum's the word.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.382
Anything else?

02:28.416 --> 02:31.519
NAZ:
We are repossessing your...

02:32.486 --> 02:33.621
...headquarters.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.390
Is that it?

02:36.424 --> 02:38.392
Actually...

02:38.426 --> 02:41.362
I think we need to talk
about the dress code.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.268
BRIAN: So that's pretty much
been my week back at work--

02:47.301 --> 02:50.338
toeing the line,
keeping my head down,

02:50.371 --> 02:52.740
waiting for Piper
to finish her enzyme,

02:52.773 --> 02:55.276
imagining freedom
from Senator Morra,

02:55.309 --> 02:57.845
losing my mind.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.690
There was
a silver lining, though.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.292
After everything
I'd put her through

03:11.325 --> 03:12.226
by running off to Russia,

03:12.260 --> 03:15.396
I didn't really see it coming,
but...

03:15.429 --> 03:17.398
It's okay, Brian.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.267
You mean...

03:19.300 --> 03:21.535
Let's just put it behind us
and focus on what's next, okay?

03:21.569 --> 03:24.405
CHOIR:
* Hallelujah

03:24.438 --> 03:26.874
She even agreed
to be my handler again.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.742
* Hallelujah, halle...

03:29.877 --> 03:31.845
Hey, cool.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.281
More files.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.882
Well, if you're looking
for a change of pace,

03:34.915 --> 03:37.685
you can take these reimbursement
forms down to Accounting for me.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.453
Oh, my God, yes.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.389
Escort Guy,

03:41.422 --> 03:41.955
field trip!

03:45.426 --> 03:47.261
REBECCA: I've watched the video
from this elevator

03:47.295 --> 03:48.662
so many times it's pretty much

03:48.696 --> 03:49.930
burned into my vision,

03:49.963 --> 03:52.566
and I still can't figure out
what they're saying.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.502
And their body language,
the way they're

03:54.535 --> 03:56.604
so not looking at each other.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.406
Something's not right.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.874
You've had us tailing him
since he got back,

04:00.908 --> 04:02.810
and so far we haven't
seen any evidence

04:02.843 --> 04:04.945
of him communicating
with anyone suspicious.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.780
And with the new babysitters
Naz has on him,

04:06.814 --> 04:08.582
I-I don't see how he can.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.318
Well, it doesn't mean
he hasn't already.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.386
All that time
he spent out of pocket,

04:12.420 --> 04:15.323
literally anything could have
happened while he was in Russia.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.325
You think
Finch was selling FBI secrets?

04:17.358 --> 04:19.527
To Morra or to the Russians?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.662
I don't know what I think.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.531
But I know
if it involves Jarrod Sands,

04:23.564 --> 04:26.500
it almost definitely involves
Senator Morra.

04:26.534 --> 04:27.435
You guys,

04:27.468 --> 04:29.570
if he is selling
confidential information,

04:29.603 --> 04:30.904
to senators or anyone else,

04:30.938 --> 04:32.573
we owe it to ourselves
to get in front of it.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.709
And if he isn't,
then we owe it to Brian.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.611
BOYLE:
Harris.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.780
There you are.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.515
Grab Finch.
We got work.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.751
Stand down for now.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.320
I'm not gonna let this go.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.425
Wow.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.093
This place is a lot.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.429
Well, Gordon Roper
is a billionaire.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.397
Was a billionaire.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.066
Roper was found murdered
over by that window.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.602
NYPD puts it
between midnight and 3:00 a.m.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.405
Body was found
by the housekeeper this morning.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.540
No sign of forced entry,
but it was brutal.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.542
His right kidney
is missing.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.544
Someone cut it out.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.680
Well, that's very specific.

05:12.713 --> 05:16.384
Detectives found some of Roper's
medical records in his study.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.018
Apparently he'd been battling
kidney disease

05:18.051 --> 05:19.620
for a number of years.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.522
He was on several waiting lists
for a transplant.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.090
Well, did he get one?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.392
His records show

05:24.425 --> 05:26.360
his dialysis visits
ended weeks ago.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.629
Well, NYPD called
the National Transplant List

05:28.662 --> 05:29.830
and hospitals in the area.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.732
None reported matching Roper.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.734
Does it remind you
of the DeVera case?

05:33.767 --> 05:37.638
Art DeVera went to Costa Rica
to buy a black market liver.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.972
Transplant went fine,

05:39.006 --> 05:40.974
but he ended up
owing the broker some money.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.676
And when he couldn't pay,

05:42.710 --> 05:46.547
they sent someone to...
repossess the liver.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.748
Oh.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.917
Roper was crazy rich.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.453
A guy like this could
definitely afford a new kidney.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.588
You say the housekeeper
found him? Wasn't he married?

05:54.622 --> 05:56.590
Where's the wife?
Downstairs.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.926
She just drove in
from their house in Connecticut.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.128
Gordon didn't want people
to know he was sick.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.129
He knew they'd speculate

06:02.162 --> 06:04.798
about his work,
what it meant for the companies

06:04.832 --> 06:06.667
he'd invested in.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.937
He felt a responsibility
to his partners.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.473
Is that why he kept
the transplant quiet?

06:13.941 --> 06:15.909
REBECCA: Clearly your
husband's murder

06:15.943 --> 06:17.845
had something to do
with his kidney.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.647
Mrs. Roper,
we need to know

06:19.680 --> 06:21.682
the details of the transplant.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.550
BOYLE:
Even if it was

06:22.583 --> 06:23.684
a private transaction.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.654
They made us sign a very strict
nondisclosure agreement.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.855
Who did, the hospital?

06:27.888 --> 06:31.191
Biosoma. The company that made

06:31.224 --> 06:32.760
the kidney.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.030
I'm sorry,
did you say "made" it?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.098
They do bioprinting.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.902
Like 3-D printing
but they make tissues, organs.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.705
Gordon was an investor.

06:44.738 --> 06:49.042
Are you saying your husband had
a kidney that was 3-D printed?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.678
The first one ever made.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.145
Wow.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.214
That certainly explains

06:54.247 --> 06:55.983
why someone would want it.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.518
(whimpering)

06:57.551 --> 06:58.586
REBECCA:
This is more

06:58.619 --> 07:00.921
than a murder.
This seems like a...

07:00.954 --> 07:03.591
like a heist.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.528
We need to check out
this Biosoma operation

07:07.561 --> 07:09.597
in the morning.
Yeah, I'll see
what I can dig up tonight.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.999
Well, guys, I would
say it's beer o'clock,

07:12.032 --> 07:14.067
but I'm sure that violates
one of my new rules.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.104
And, besides,
my mom's here.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.242
(engine starts)

07:22.275 --> 07:26.714
Hey. So, I finally figured out
what I'm gonna call you guys.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.782
And don't pretend
like you haven't been waiting.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.784
Or do.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.521
Or just maintain
that totally indifferent

07:33.554 --> 07:35.923
poker face thing you do.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.858
Mr. X.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.993
To go with your air
of mystery.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.062
Although, you know what,
I guess, technically,

07:42.095 --> 07:45.533
the other guy started first,
so he'd have to be Mr. X.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.569
It's only fair,
but you can be Mr. Y.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.572
Good talk.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.575
(sighs)

07:57.310 --> 08:00.548
Hey, where are we going, man?

08:00.581 --> 08:02.049
I live the other way.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.889
(creaking)

08:14.728 --> 08:16.730
Sands?

08:17.765 --> 08:20.267
You work for Morra?

08:37.718 --> 08:40.020
This is a nice place.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.556
Very... remote.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.757
Bit out of the way.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.795
But you can't be too careful.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.832
FBI watching you quite closely,
aren't they?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.934
He'll be working with you
from now on.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.036
The senator thinks

08:56.069 --> 08:58.839
this'll make the arrangement
a lot easier,

08:58.872 --> 09:00.307
given
your current circumstances.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.743
What about you?

09:02.776 --> 09:05.746
I'll be working
in a different capacity.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.648
Is that some kind of euphemism?

09:07.681 --> 09:09.583
I suppose we'll see.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.585
You don't know?

09:11.619 --> 09:13.954
Don't worry
about me, Brian.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.758
The senator wants you
to know everything's fine.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.127
It's gonna get better. Safer.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.030
What does that mean?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.065
No more violence.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.706
Arm.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.117
*

10:05.038 --> 10:06.807
BRIAN: It was bad enough when
it was just Naz's ten rules

10:06.840 --> 10:09.342
I had to follow, but with
Morra's guy watching me

10:09.376 --> 10:12.813
all night and Naz's guy
watching me all day,

10:12.846 --> 10:15.849
I had no choice but to stick
to the straight and narrow.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.689
MAN: The human body
is amazingly complex.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.756
While we've managed

10:22.790 --> 10:25.125
to combine 3-D printing
technology and human cells

10:25.158 --> 10:27.661
to manufacture
functioning human tissues,

10:27.695 --> 10:30.263
something like a kidney
or a liver isn't just tissue--

10:30.297 --> 10:33.667
it's an intricate network
of nerves, blood vessels.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.669
The biggest challenge
of bioprinting is how to leave

10:35.703 --> 10:37.805
the space for those things and
how to build them fast enough

10:37.838 --> 10:39.840
so that the cells around them
don't die.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.341
Oh, yeah, I've read about this.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.276
But everyone says we're years
away from working organs.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.846
So how did you figure it out?

10:45.879 --> 10:47.848
Our engineers deserve
the most credit.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.750
And our investors.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.951
Like Gordon Roper.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.387
The news this morning, our
whole company's... devastated.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.923
He was like a member
of our family.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.758
Well, he was
also your guinea pig.

10:57.791 --> 10:58.926
We know he wasn't just

10:58.959 --> 11:00.393
your investor.
His wife told us

11:00.427 --> 11:02.262
Gordon's kidney was bioprinted.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.932
BOYLE: But we're not here
to discuss NIH violations

11:04.965 --> 11:07.735
Seems whoever killed him
wanted that kidney,

11:07.768 --> 11:09.402
so we need to know
everything about it.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.875
DOCTOR: Years ago,
when I saw the potential

11:14.908 --> 11:16.076
in manufacturing tissues,

11:16.109 --> 11:18.445
my colleagues thought it was
too far off to be practical.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.180
Gordon was willing
to take the risk.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.782
Well, he had a
personal interest.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.716
His own kidneys
were failing, right?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.885
Yes, he was already
on dialysis by then,

11:24.918 --> 11:26.754
and because
of his medical history,

11:26.787 --> 11:28.756
he was at the bottom
of all the transplant lists.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.323
He was desperate.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.025
BOYLE: Yeah, but there are
other ways for desperate people

11:32.059 --> 11:33.927
with means to get an organ.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.896
Of course. But Gordon
saw the bigger picture.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.865
The opportunity
to help the world.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.332
By funding your research.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.334
As far as I know,
our prototype is the world's

11:41.368 --> 11:43.503
first bioprinted organ.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.305
Or was, I suppose.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.840
How did it end up
in Gordon Roper?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.942
Well, Gordon didn't
have much to lose, he said.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.510
But he had everything to gain.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.113
If it worked, he'd be a living
billboard, and his investment

11:53.146 --> 11:54.481
would pay off twofold.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.149
He was always a businessman.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.517
Yeah, but it did work,

11:57.550 --> 11:59.186
didn't it?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.321
I mean, Roper was off dialysis.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.390
How are you guys not
shouting this from the rooftops?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.793
Because transplants
are a long game.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.928
If the kidney failed,

12:07.961 --> 12:09.797
our company would be doomed
by bad press.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.199
It's why we went to Costa Rica
for the surgery.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.836
And it's why I insisted
that everyone involved sign a...

12:15.869 --> 12:17.137
non-disclosure agreement.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.839
Well, doctor,
we're gonna need to see those.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.142
Okay, so I need to comb
through everyone who signed

12:22.175 --> 12:24.177
a non-disclosure agreement
with Biosoma.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.314
And anyone they might have
told anyway.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.983
Spouses, assistants, friends.

12:30.017 --> 12:33.420
Maybe one of them has a motive
for killing Gordon Roper.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.824
That's weird.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.832
Where's your posse?

12:44.865 --> 12:45.966
What do you mean?

12:45.999 --> 12:49.169
Mike and Ike. Well, I saw
you guys huddled up yesterday.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.439
Looked a little intense.
How are they taking it?

12:52.472 --> 12:55.008
You know, Naz
chewed 'em out pretty good

12:55.042 --> 12:57.010
about Russia, right?

12:57.044 --> 12:59.079
Well, I mean,
they're fine, considering.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.982
They wish
it hadn't happened, obviously.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.984
Don't we all?

13:04.017 --> 13:06.319
You're taking it
pretty well, though.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.324
Bigger fish to fry.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.166
I didn't know what
the text meant at first.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.835
Was it Morra, was he trying
to get in touch with me?

13:21.869 --> 13:23.403
But why wouldn't he use Mr. Y?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.309
All I knew was it was a code.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.414
And I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.017
Wait, 929.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.518
That's a New York area code.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.488
It's a phone number
and a name.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.256
Piper.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.161
Piper is back in New York.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.329
What have you got?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.899
Besides crumbs on the evidence.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.935
Yes. Well... (clears throat)
Aside from Gordon Roper,

13:54.968 --> 13:57.037
his wife, and his
personal physician,

13:57.070 --> 13:59.940
most of the non-disclosure
agreements were signed by

13:59.973 --> 14:01.241
Biosoma employees.
All have possible motives

14:01.274 --> 14:02.976
for wanting to profit off

14:03.010 --> 14:04.311
Gordon Roper's kidney.
Then there's the usual suspects.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.578
Scorned assistant.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.181
The lead engineer
with a staggering amount

14:08.215 --> 14:11.518
of gambling debt.
And this guy.

14:11.551 --> 14:15.088
He's a lab tech that used to
work for a competing company.

14:15.122 --> 14:18.025
I'm thinking he might be
some kind of mole or something?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.526
Yeah, could be.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.594
We should figure out where they
all were last night. And then

14:21.628 --> 14:24.898
cross-check their DNA with
the DNA we found at the scene.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.100
I'm way ahead of you.
The DNA of an unknown male

14:27.134 --> 14:28.668
was found
on and around the body.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.669
A state department

14:29.702 --> 14:31.104
database turned up a match

14:31.138 --> 14:33.273
from a visa application
from a Sri Lankan

14:33.306 --> 14:34.674
named Rohan Kumar.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.243
REBECCA: Is he
one of your suspects?

14:36.276 --> 14:37.945
No.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.380
Who the hell is Rohan Kumar?

14:40.413 --> 14:42.515
State department, you said?
Yeah.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.020
Finch, are you hacking
into the state department?

14:47.054 --> 14:49.589
Okay, you're not supposed
to watch this.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.025
Do you want me to pull up
some YouTube videos of, uh,

14:52.059 --> 14:53.060
a cat getting stuck in a...

14:53.093 --> 14:55.295
No, thank you.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.234
Okay, Gordon Roper's
transplant happened

15:01.268 --> 15:02.970
about a month ago
in Costa Rica, right?

15:03.003 --> 15:04.071
Right.
Well, guess who

15:04.104 --> 15:06.406
flew in and out of San JosГ©
right around that time?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.343
Tell me again
why this guy isn't a suspect?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.045
I'm trying to show you.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.113
Maybe he isn't home.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.381
MAN:
Who is it?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.049
FBI.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.053
BRIAN:
Are you Rohan Kumar?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.022
My name is Brian Finch.
I work at the FBI

15:22.055 --> 15:24.591
with Agents Boyle and Harris.
Can we come in?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.395
Mr. Kumar, would you do me
a favor-- would you lift up

15:28.428 --> 15:31.231
your shirt for me, please?

15:31.264 --> 15:33.066
Gordon Roper
was murdered and your DNA

15:33.100 --> 15:34.734
was all over
the crime scene.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.137
Now, I don't think
you were there, even at all.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.139
But a part of you was,
wasn't it?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.010
(sighs)

15:43.043 --> 15:44.277
Can you just...
lift up your shirt?

15:44.311 --> 15:45.612
Thanks.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.150
Mr. Kumar
is not a killer.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.121
He's a kidney donor.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.629
I needed money.
And I thought it would be good

16:02.662 --> 16:06.033
if I could
help someone else, too.

16:06.066 --> 16:09.236
But I never met this man,
Gordon Roper.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.404
I swear I was never
in his house.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.306
I believe you.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.208
All the blood
at the crime scene was Gordon's.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.210
But did you know that
DNA of a donor organ

16:17.244 --> 16:20.213
can be detected in
the recipient's bloodstream?

16:20.247 --> 16:22.349
Sometimes for years
after the transplant?

16:22.382 --> 16:24.384
How do you know that?

16:25.285 --> 16:26.453
MAN: DNA from the donor's organ

16:26.486 --> 16:28.355
can be found
in the recipient's blood...

16:28.388 --> 16:31.558
God, I miss him.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.161
Sinbad.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.464
Mr. Kumar, how did you arrange
for the transplant?

16:37.497 --> 16:40.333
A friend of my cousin

16:40.367 --> 16:42.669
said he knew
someone who could help me.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.772
I was in a bad place--
I needed money.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.108
This man...

16:48.141 --> 16:50.243
Adi.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.744
He set up the medical exam,

16:51.778 --> 16:53.012
found a match...

16:53.046 --> 16:55.615
And flew you out to Costa Rica
for the operation, didn't he?

16:57.717 --> 17:00.420
Adi said he'd take care of me,
but when I went back to him

17:00.453 --> 17:03.623
he said no one is
going to listen to an immigrant.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.692
and if I kept making noise,

17:05.725 --> 17:08.228
no one would miss an immigrant.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.363
You still have
this Adi guy's info?

17:11.664 --> 17:13.800
(groaning)

17:13.833 --> 17:15.535
You should be in a hospital.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.304
BRIAN: So obviously there
was no bioprinted kidney

17:17.337 --> 17:18.805
in Gordon Roper.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.573
BOYLE: Which means
Daniel Lee lied to us,

17:20.607 --> 17:23.276
and if we can track down this
Adi guy and confirm Lee paid him

17:23.310 --> 17:25.478
for the kidney,
we can bring Lee in.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.215
Do you mind if we make
a quick stop?

17:28.248 --> 17:29.682
I need a doughnut, like, whoa.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.462
One more maple. I'm gonna
see if my friends want some.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.863
You guys want one of these?

17:43.896 --> 17:46.299
Maple log? No?

17:48.435 --> 17:49.836
Okay, so I don't need
a doughnut

17:49.869 --> 17:51.638
as much as I needed a cover.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.341
I don't know if I'll be able
to duck out later,

17:54.374 --> 17:55.408
what with the new rules
and all.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.344
I'll take this, too.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.847
But I needed to get in touch
with Piper on the DL.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.824
Are you guys sure
you don't want anything?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.693
I got enough doughnuts
for everyone to have one.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.496
Hey, I've had to pee
since 73rd.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.531
I'll be right back,
all right?

18:26.306 --> 18:27.807
(line ringing)

18:30.510 --> 18:31.711
(ringing stops)

18:31.744 --> 18:33.413
Hello?

18:33.446 --> 18:34.447
PIPER: Are you alone?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.383
Yes.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.351
And the phone?

18:38.385 --> 18:40.487
It's disposable.
I can't talk long.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.554
PIPER: It's done.

18:41.588 --> 18:44.357
The thing I was working on.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.458
Can we meet?

18:45.492 --> 18:46.593
(sighs) When?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.495
Tonight. 10:30.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.497
The High Line.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.899
I'll have to figure it out,
but I'll figure it out.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.667
(line disconnects)

18:59.639 --> 19:02.509
Fraud, organ trafficking,
murder.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.411
Adding obstruction of justice
almost feels excessive.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.313
How did you think this
was gonna go your way, Daniel?

19:06.346 --> 19:07.514
I didn't
do those things.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.416
Ooh, Adi Benesch would disagree.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.418
He's the broker
you paid $200,000 to

19:11.451 --> 19:12.952
in exchange for a healthy kidney

19:12.985 --> 19:15.188
that used to belong
to Rohan Kumar.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.557
I was so close
to a functional prototype.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.226
Getting the rest of the way
depended on

19:19.259 --> 19:21.228
Gordon Roper's investment,
and he was running out of time.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.429
I had to do something.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.198
So you told Roper it was ready,

19:25.232 --> 19:27.467
and then gave him
a black market kidney instead?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.501
Temporarily.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.636
He had no idea?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.438
When I got
the bioprinted prototype right,

19:31.471 --> 19:33.306
I was gonna swap 'em out

19:33.340 --> 19:34.607
and tell him it was just
an upgraded version.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.609
That's why all
the non-disclosure agreements--

19:36.643 --> 19:38.245
if word got around before
the swap, you'd be exposed

19:38.278 --> 19:39.479
as the fraud you are.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.414
So was someone talking?
Were you trying to get

19:41.448 --> 19:43.650
the kidney back before someone
found out what you'd done?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.485
No, I swear I didn't kill him.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.486
Search through all my records.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.654
Like I told you before:

19:47.687 --> 19:48.821
Gordon was my greatest investor.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.390
If I wanted him dead,
why would I have

19:50.423 --> 19:51.958
gone to such great lengths
to save him?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.863
Okay. So, Daniel Lee's story

19:56.896 --> 19:58.465
seems to check out.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.567
Thus, welcome to the first
official convening

20:00.600 --> 20:02.535
of the Bruntouchables--
way to represent, James--

20:02.569 --> 20:04.704
since the whole
Top Ten affair.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.307
Which, by the by,
we totally would have finished

20:07.340 --> 20:08.675
if we weren't
cut off prematurely.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.477
Okay.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.980
Guys, we have a murder.
And none of our suspects

20:14.013 --> 20:16.583
are the type to kill someone
on their own.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.952
So, the way I see it, we have
a very particular Venn diagram.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.322
Circle number one:

20:22.355 --> 20:24.257
people who kill for money.

20:27.527 --> 20:31.564
Circle two: people with
the expertise to remove a kidney

20:31.598 --> 20:33.032
without doing undue damage
to the organ.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.967
We'll call that "skillz"...

20:35.968 --> 20:38.037
...with a Z.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.640
Now, I'm guessing
that there's not enough

20:40.673 --> 20:42.742
of that particular
kind of murder-for-hire work

20:42.775 --> 20:44.577
to pay the bills.
So, they probably

20:44.611 --> 20:46.379
get most of their money
doing medical work.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.614
Off the books,
of course.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.283
So, someone gets shot doing
something that they shouldn't--

20:50.317 --> 20:51.784
they can't go to a hospital,

20:51.818 --> 20:53.953
so they get someone
to patch it up quietly.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.588
Exactly. That's exactly right.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.591
So, to find that person...

20:58.625 --> 21:00.960
we need a wound.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.763
I'm sorry.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.799
What kind of wound
are we talking about?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.668
Well, I mean, in order to lure

21:08.701 --> 21:10.637
our
underground-doctor-cum-hitman

21:10.670 --> 21:11.638
out of hiding,

21:11.671 --> 21:13.373
we need to offer him...

21:13.406 --> 21:15.074
Or her! Sorry.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.008
Oh, my God.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.410
...the possibility

21:17.444 --> 21:18.645
of some medical work.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.881
I was just thinking...
(imitates gunshot)

21:21.914 --> 21:23.416
...straight through-and-through.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.552
Back of the thigh, mostly damage
to the fatty tissue,

21:25.585 --> 21:27.454
you'll be back
playing tennis in no time.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.322
Why are you looking at me?
Uh, because,

21:29.356 --> 21:31.023
James, you're the only one
that works sitting down.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.693
We have to investigate,
Stavros has to mop.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.962
Uh, uh, Brian.
There's no way I can allow you

21:35.995 --> 21:37.530
to discharge a firearm
for the purpose

21:37.564 --> 21:39.366
of hurting a Bureau employee.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.032
Thank you.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.034
How about a bladed weapon?

21:42.068 --> 21:43.636
Oh, forget it.
I hate knives.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.639
I run triathlons.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.376
I dance.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.544
I'll do it.
Stavros?

21:51.578 --> 21:53.680
I have no feeling
in my left leg anyway.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.548
From Macedonia.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.884
And I look forward
to hearing all about that.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.852
Mike, Ike, you guys take
care of the whole...

21:59.886 --> 22:01.788
of it all.
James, do me a favor.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.723
put the word out on the,
you know, seedy underworld.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.625
And we should have a line
out to our guy in no time.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.594
And what if we don't?
REBECCA:
Brian?

22:07.627 --> 22:09.061
Even if he is volunteering,

22:09.095 --> 22:11.798
there's no way I can allow
anyone to be injured.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.065
You're right.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.902
As an agent of the FBI,
you need to

22:15.935 --> 22:17.637
voice your objection.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.705
That's very responsible.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.473
Aah!

22:20.507 --> 22:22.609
(all screaming)

22:26.413 --> 22:28.581
And our fishing lines
were cast.

22:28.615 --> 22:29.816
We just had
to wait for a bite.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.352
And in the meantime, I had
plenty of other stuff to do.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.428
Hey, can I head out?

22:41.461 --> 22:42.962
I'm still crazy jet-lagged,
and I read somewhere that it

22:42.995 --> 22:45.932
takes like a week for every time
zone to, you know, readjust.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.434
Brian, it's fine.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.668
Get some rest.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.837
Big day tomorrow.
All right.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.750
Okay, so in order to get
to my meeting with Piper,

23:03.783 --> 23:05.685
I might have to break a rule.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.754
Maybe two.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.992
Principally,
I need to ditch my shadow.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.064
(sighs)

23:18.097 --> 23:20.633
More accurately,
ditch him in such a way

23:20.667 --> 23:22.635
that he doesn't know
he's being ditched.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.136
(sighs)

23:24.170 --> 23:26.606
Survey says--

23:26.639 --> 23:27.774
knock the guy out.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.109
(bell dings)
But how?

23:30.142 --> 23:33.646
(dart whooshes)
Maybe a little
Indiana Jones action.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.685
Or perhaps something
a little more James Bond?

23:44.791 --> 23:46.793
There's always
the Machiavellian approach.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.464
Food's not the worst idea.

23:51.498 --> 23:54.901
But he's never gonna take
anything I have in here.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.137
Luckily, I've been
ordering in a lot.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.872
And statistically,
the most popular pizza

23:59.906 --> 24:01.708
is thin crust, plain cheese.
(doorbell rings)

24:01.741 --> 24:03.042
Who can say no to that?

24:03.075 --> 24:04.677
Thank you...

24:04.711 --> 24:06.145
And since
he's seen it delivered

24:06.178 --> 24:08.781
without interference--
or, okay,

24:08.815 --> 24:11.484
without visible interference...

24:11.518 --> 24:13.520
Smells good.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.123
That's rude, here.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.058
Do you want some of this
cheesy, cheesy goodness, man?

24:19.091 --> 24:20.993
You want in on this?
Get it while it's hot?

24:21.027 --> 24:22.629
Huh?

24:22.662 --> 24:24.230
No?

24:24.263 --> 24:26.733
Look, I get it, dude--
we're not gonna be friends.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.635
It's fine, I don't want to
be friends with you anyway.

24:28.668 --> 24:29.769
But I don't want to see you

24:29.802 --> 24:31.170
all cranky and crazy
and hungry, okay?

24:31.203 --> 24:32.739
'Cause this is weird.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.041
you're out here sitting
on a chair in the hallway

24:35.074 --> 24:36.876
like some sort
of bridge troll,

24:36.909 --> 24:40.747
while I'm inside enjoying
a nice, hot, delicious,

24:40.780 --> 24:43.516
artisanal Italian cuisine.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.884
There you go.

24:44.917 --> 24:45.885
See, I knew

24:45.918 --> 24:47.887
you weren't a cyborg.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.857
Random drug checks don't apply
to prescription medications.

24:50.890 --> 24:51.991
Even sleeping pills.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.893
Of which there are enough
on that slice to put him

24:53.926 --> 24:55.662
on the Sleepytown Express
in plenty of time

24:55.695 --> 24:57.163
for me to meet Piper.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.731
Attaboy.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.302
I thought he'd be out by now.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.572
Maybe he just needs something
to help him along.

25:05.605 --> 25:06.906
(sighs)

25:08.240 --> 25:10.877
If ever there was
a recipe for peaceful slumber,

25:10.910 --> 25:13.680
it's a full stomach,
two sleeping pills,

25:13.713 --> 25:18.284
and the soothing sounds
of Enya.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.920
* Who can say
where the road goes *

25:20.953 --> 25:23.055
(yawns)

25:23.089 --> 25:24.891
* Where the day flows

25:24.924 --> 25:26.959
* Only time

25:26.993 --> 25:29.829
* And who can say...

25:29.862 --> 25:31.197
Mission accomplished.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.635
I was four minutes late

25:35.668 --> 25:36.803
getting
to the rendezvous point.

25:36.836 --> 25:37.937
Not terrible--

25:37.970 --> 25:39.839
at least for me.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.742
But Piper was late, too.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.221
Too soon to get antsy.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.223
Anybody can be late, right?

25:57.256 --> 25:59.792
It's not like
she'd get cold feet.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.828
Or set me up?

26:05.765 --> 26:08.701
Maybe she got scared.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.603
What am I missing?

26:10.637 --> 26:13.205
Not much movement
around here except...

26:17.043 --> 26:20.647
Haven't I seen you before?

26:29.656 --> 26:31.390
Somebody's tailing me.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.894
I can't stay here.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.775
(line rings)

26:48.808 --> 26:49.776
Hello?

26:49.809 --> 26:51.711
MIKE:
No joy at the High Line.

26:51.744 --> 26:54.747
But whatever he came to do,
he left without doing it.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.315
You want us to stay on him?

26:56.348 --> 26:57.449
No, if he did spook,

26:57.483 --> 27:00.019
I don't want to give him
reason to be more suspicious.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.287
Come home.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.330
Where's Mr. Y?

27:21.741 --> 27:23.743
*

27:35.321 --> 27:39.225
Piper's bracelet.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.041
Is that blood?

28:16.863 --> 28:18.497
It was Morra.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.332
Probably not Morra himself.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.434
Sands maybe. Mr. Y.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.436
But it all comes
back to Morra.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.738
No, you don't know that.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.439
Well, who else would do this?

28:27.473 --> 28:29.942
Who else would care that you
were talking to Piper?

28:30.877 --> 28:32.178
Who else would leave you this?

28:32.211 --> 28:33.780
This is a message from Morra.

28:33.813 --> 28:34.914
No!

28:34.947 --> 28:37.283
No more violence, Sands said.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.952
That was before they found
out you didn't kill Piper

28:39.986 --> 28:42.288
like you were supposed to.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.489
You lied to them.

28:43.522 --> 28:44.891
How did they find out?

28:44.924 --> 28:46.225
I mean, did I
lead them to Piper?

28:49.461 --> 28:51.764
No, get-- Hey!

28:53.132 --> 28:54.500
Damn it.

28:54.533 --> 28:57.236
My NZT was fading and so was I.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.446
But I couldn't sleep.

29:10.182 --> 29:13.419
I listened for any report
that sounded like it could

29:13.452 --> 29:15.421
pertain to Piper.
I wouldn't accept she was gone.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.790
I needed her.

29:17.824 --> 29:20.326
Not just the enzyme, her.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.128
And if there was any chance
Piper was alive,

29:22.161 --> 29:23.963
Morra would have her.

29:26.565 --> 29:30.169
Which meant
I needed to find Morra.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.071
But the one person
who could take me to him

29:32.104 --> 29:33.472
was gone.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.441
I don't know
what you want me to say.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.344
Um, Mr. Y was there
when I went to sleep.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.113
Uh, he was asleep,
too, actually.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.982
"Mr. Y"?

29:43.015 --> 29:44.450
Yeah, that's just
what I called him.

29:44.483 --> 29:48.220
Um, no one told me
his real name, so...

29:48.254 --> 29:50.256
That's Mr. X.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.293
What'd Finch do now?

29:54.326 --> 29:57.496
Um... well,
he lost his babysitter.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.267
What's going on, Reb?

30:01.300 --> 30:02.568
What do you mean?

30:02.601 --> 30:03.970
I mean something's off

30:04.003 --> 30:06.505
ever since Finch
got back from Russia.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.208
Well, I think he's just
trying to get back to normal.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.476
You know, he's overwhelmed...

30:10.509 --> 30:13.279
I don't mean with him.
I mean you.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.517
I see the way you're
watching him all the time.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.153
Secret meetings
with Ike and Mike.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.388
Those are about Brian.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.291
You think something's
going on with him.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.362
(scoffs)

30:30.396 --> 30:33.065
Okay, okay.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.636
You know, you never used
to keep things from me.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.271
Not things like this.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.044
And I never used
to lie to you, either.

30:45.077 --> 30:48.047
Lie to me?

31:00.159 --> 31:02.161
Where did you get that?

31:02.194 --> 31:03.629
I found it.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.631
After Casey died.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.333
I don't know
why I didn't turn it in.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.903
You know how I feel
about the stuff.

31:10.937 --> 31:13.005
But I got tempted.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.306
I guess.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.641
I thought about giving it
to my mother.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.143
Give her one last great day.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.678
But it's just been burning
a hole in my pocket.

31:19.711 --> 31:23.082
'Cause it's the first time I've
ever done anything like this.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.551
Gone against the CJC.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.955
And it's the only secret
I've ever kept from you.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.223
And I don't like it.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.525
I don't like keeping secrets.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.930
Do whatever you need to do.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.569
It's not that
I don't trust you, Boyle.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.505
It's just that I...

31:46.538 --> 31:48.474
I had to figure out
what I was dealing with,

31:48.507 --> 31:49.508
so I could know
what to do with it.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.944
I-I didn't want to put you
in the middle of it.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.980
Just tell me what's going on.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.618
Okay, okay.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.587
You're right.
Wait, you're right.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.957
There is something going on
with Brian.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.728
And Mr. Y
fell asleep at his post?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.131
I didn't hire him.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.499
We're going to look
into what happened,

32:13.532 --> 32:14.733
and we're going to find
a replacement.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.202
And in the meantime,

32:16.235 --> 32:18.437
I will sit with you myself
if I have to.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.638
Rad.

32:19.671 --> 32:22.008
Partying with Naz.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.544
You haven't gone to Naz
with any of this?

32:25.577 --> 32:26.245
Well, what if I'm wrong?

32:26.278 --> 32:29.215
You're not often wrong, Rebecca.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.250
So stop waiting around
for some smoking gun.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.185
Because at that point,
it might be too late,

32:33.219 --> 32:35.154
and this could come crashing
down on all of us.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.514
JAMES:
Brian?

33:03.449 --> 33:05.684
James Tech.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.353
How's Stavros?

33:07.386 --> 33:08.654
Come with me.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.995
Bruntouchables do it again.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.466
Did you found a guy?

33:20.499 --> 33:21.567
Is that the guy?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.702
That's definitely
the guy.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.171
(sighs)

33:25.204 --> 33:27.673
Hey, Stavros.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.741
How's the leg?

33:29.775 --> 33:33.745
Is small price to pay.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.348
I'm not gonna say Stavros
had an easy time last night.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.550
(screaming)
He had to visit more
than one shady provider

33:38.584 --> 33:42.154
of illicit medical care looking
for one who fit the bill.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.523
As soon as each suspect
accepted the money...

33:44.556 --> 33:46.725
(screaming)

33:46.758 --> 33:48.427
James Tech jumped into action.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.762
Searching their computers,
poking around behind firewalls.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.531
Outside of general
creep factor,

33:52.564 --> 33:54.333
none threw up
any red flags

33:54.366 --> 33:56.535
until...

33:56.568 --> 33:58.737
It was Stavros who finally
pegged our likely candidate.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.840
As far as he was concerned,
this was our hit man,

34:01.873 --> 34:03.609
which along with
the vet's willingness

34:03.642 --> 34:04.810
to illegally
practice medicine,

34:04.843 --> 34:07.846
was enough for us to get
a warrant for a deeper search.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.615
(screaming)

34:09.648 --> 34:11.517
(agents shouting indistinctly)

34:11.550 --> 34:14.286
According to his e-mails,
this guy was involved

34:14.320 --> 34:16.855
in dozens
of off-the-books operations

34:16.888 --> 34:18.857
with all kinds
of shady characters.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.859
But what caught

34:20.892 --> 34:23.229
James Tech's eye
was a suspicious exchange

34:23.262 --> 34:25.764
between the vet and someone
with the proxy address

34:25.797 --> 34:27.833
Sheepadoodle1996.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.202
Remember the last time
we saw a Sheepadoodle?

34:30.236 --> 34:31.437
MIRANDA:
I'm sorry,

34:31.470 --> 34:33.205
You're here because

34:33.239 --> 34:36.475
a veterinarian you met is
having an e-mail exchange

34:36.508 --> 34:38.177
with someone
who owns a Sheepadoodle?

34:38.210 --> 34:40.546
Not someone who owns
a Sheepadoodle, you.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.115
1996 was the year
you and Gordon were married.

34:43.149 --> 34:45.384
And the Sheepadoodle
in question-- Montgomery, right?

34:45.417 --> 34:46.785
Is your husband's.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.587
Montgomery belonged to us both.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.755
Leave him alone, please.

34:49.788 --> 34:53.425
(whimpering softly)

34:53.459 --> 34:55.794
I still don't see what this
has to do with anything.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.464
Well, you and your husband
were having a difficult time,

34:58.497 --> 35:00.832
according to just about
everyone we talked to.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.335
His divorce lawyer
was about to jump all over

35:03.369 --> 35:06.138
your divorce lawyer,
when suddenly Gordon gets sick.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.274
You offer to stick around
and patch things up,

35:08.307 --> 35:10.709
because you thought
probably he would die soon,

35:10.742 --> 35:12.844
and then you'd get at least
a little bit of the fortune.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.414
Then Biosoma had a breakthrough,
and it started to look

35:15.447 --> 35:17.216
like he might actually
live after all.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.151
And you saw an opportunity.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.652
The first
bio-printed kidney.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.155
That's pretty special.

35:23.189 --> 35:25.291
Something someone
might kill for.

35:25.324 --> 35:26.825
(chuckles)

35:26.858 --> 35:29.595
It's really ironic
when you think about it.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.198
You thought
the first bio-printed kidney

35:32.231 --> 35:34.466
was the perfect cover,
but little did you know,

35:34.500 --> 35:36.202
it wasn't bio-printed at all.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.303
What?

35:37.336 --> 35:38.337
And Daniel Lee
thought he'd have time

35:38.370 --> 35:40.472
to swap it out,
but little did he know,

35:40.506 --> 35:43.375
you were gonna kill his patient.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.611
You actually listen
to this person?

35:45.644 --> 35:47.279
He had a hard time
convincing us, too,

35:47.313 --> 35:48.547
until Dr. Kinder gave you up.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.848
BOYLE:
See, he had priors.

35:49.881 --> 35:50.949
And he wasn't
too eager to take

35:50.982 --> 35:52.818
his chances in front
of a jury again.

35:52.851 --> 35:55.921
Any evidence you have
is circumstantial at best.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.323
REBECCA:
That's okay by me.

35:57.356 --> 35:58.890
If we keep digging--
and we will--

35:58.924 --> 36:00.526
I'm sure we'll come up
with a smoking gun.

36:00.559 --> 36:01.627
BOYLE:
Yes.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.829
Are you sure this dog's okay?

36:03.862 --> 36:06.598
Monty, you seem
a little lethargic.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.202
Like you've been sedated.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.604
That got me thinking.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.840
I won't get too graphic
about pumping a dog's stomach.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.875
But suffice it to say--
Montgomery was fine.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.245
And what we found in there
was worth it.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.979
Namely, a hefty dose
of the same sedative

36:21.012 --> 36:22.448
used to take out Gordon Roper.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.682
And more importantly?

36:23.715 --> 36:25.951
Traces of Rohan Kumar's DNA.

36:25.984 --> 36:28.887
It takes a lot of spite
to feed what you think

36:28.920 --> 36:31.657
is your dead husband's
kidney to his dog.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.226
But it is a handy way
to get rid of it.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.629
And now I need
to find Senator Morra

36:37.663 --> 36:39.731
and find out
what happened to Piper.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.636
Ever try to search
for something

36:44.670 --> 36:46.372
without searching for it?

36:46.405 --> 36:47.973
That's what I had to do,

36:48.006 --> 36:49.475
since my every keystroke
was being logged.

36:49.508 --> 36:50.776
Why are you still here?

36:50.809 --> 36:51.843
Actually,

36:51.877 --> 36:53.312
I was just about to leave.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.880
Mr. X has double duty today.

36:54.913 --> 36:55.981
No word from the other guy?

36:56.014 --> 36:57.316
No, nothing.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.917
It's weird, right?

36:58.950 --> 37:01.387
I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.661
Should we follow?

37:09.695 --> 37:11.363
No.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.401
Let him go.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.971
It took three subway changes,
but I finally lost Mr. X.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.608
Two more trains,
and I made it to St. Ann's.

37:22.641 --> 37:23.775
(crowd clamoring)

37:36.054 --> 37:38.957
BRIAN:
Senator Morra!

37:38.990 --> 37:40.426
Senator Morra!

37:42.828 --> 37:44.530
You want him? All right.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.304
Excuse me, let him through.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.340
The senator would
like a word with you.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.656
Brian.

38:10.689 --> 38:11.890
I'm a little busy here.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.760
Something about who's
gonna become president.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.329
Whatever this is, Senator,
we don't have time for it.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.365
It's okay.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.403
I'm sorry.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.672
I didn't kill Piper Baird.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.408
But you know that.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.477
I went to Russia

38:31.510 --> 38:32.978
to help her get
the last thing she needs

38:33.011 --> 38:35.514
to make the immunity shot.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.017
I wanted to be free.

38:40.552 --> 38:43.822
And I was stupid to think
that I could outsmart you.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.394
But I'm here now,

38:48.427 --> 38:50.729
and I'm asking you--

38:50.762 --> 38:52.631
man, I'm begging you--

38:52.664 --> 38:54.600
for mercy.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.471
If you haven't
killed Piper yet,

38:59.505 --> 39:02.374
please don't.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.378
That is...

39:06.412 --> 39:09.815
so interesting.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.051
I knew you went to Russia.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.020
But until you came
in here,

39:15.053 --> 39:17.088
I had no idea Piper
was still alive.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.157
If Sands knew that,

39:19.190 --> 39:21.727
he kept it to himself.
(chuckles)

39:21.760 --> 39:24.129
But I found
her bracelet

39:24.162 --> 39:26.498
covered in blood
in my apartment.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.434
Yeah, that was Sands, not me.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.736
Try to keep up.
What, do you need a pill?

39:30.769 --> 39:33.572
Sands has Piper,
which according to you,

39:33.605 --> 39:35.407
means he's got
the immunity shot.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.709
So Jarrod Sands doesn't
work for me anymore.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.378
He's gone rogue.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.419
Danny, get Brian
a water, please?

39:47.453 --> 39:48.420
Are you kidding me?

39:48.454 --> 39:49.521
What, do you want
something else?

39:49.555 --> 39:50.956
No, I don't, I don't
want any water.

39:50.989 --> 39:51.890
You just told me that Sands

39:51.923 --> 39:53.925
can take NZT now?

39:53.959 --> 39:55.527
If he can takes it,
he's got some way of making it,

39:55.561 --> 39:58.897
which means he's working
with other people.

39:58.930 --> 40:02.033
This look straight?

40:02.067 --> 40:03.802
You just told me that Sands
is pulling together a team of

40:03.835 --> 40:05.937
super villains and you're asking
me if your tie knot is straight?

40:05.971 --> 40:08.440
Brian, I'm about
to go give a speech

40:08.474 --> 40:10.008
that's gonna catapult me
into the front of the race.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.843
It's gonna be beautiful.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.111
Seriously, you should
stay and watch.

40:13.144 --> 40:14.880
Danny can get you a seat.

40:14.913 --> 40:15.981
And you know what?

40:16.014 --> 40:17.516
It'll be fun.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.585
Who doesn't like
a standing ovation?

40:19.618 --> 40:21.620
But to be honest,

40:21.653 --> 40:25.190
I'm thinking so far beyond
the presidency right now

40:25.223 --> 40:27.593
you can't even imagine.

40:27.626 --> 40:28.927
Well, you should be
thinking about the fact

40:28.960 --> 40:30.662
that Sands and his
people are gonna be

40:30.696 --> 40:33.031
coming after you and me.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.066
DANNY:
It's time, Senator.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.539
They'll have a plan,
and it won't be small.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.909
And it'll be hard for you,
but you're gonna be okay.

40:45.744 --> 40:49.147
Let Sands and his people
do their thing.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.050
This fight?

40:52.083 --> 40:55.687
It's not about who's
gonna control this world.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.027
It's about who's
gonna build the next one.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.673
(crowd applauding)

41:14.706 --> 41:16.708
*

41:46.572 --> 41:48.039
*

42:02.020 --> 42:04.055
I took the pill
Senator Morra gave me,

42:04.089 --> 42:05.691
and I stayed up most of
the night thinking about it.

42:05.724 --> 42:06.925
But I still couldn't figure out

42:06.958 --> 42:08.293
why he wasn't more worried
about Sands.

42:08.326 --> 42:09.928
(knocking)

42:09.961 --> 42:11.129
REPORTER: Senator Morra spoke
at a New York City church,

42:11.162 --> 42:15.033
calling the city a global
beacon of div--

42:20.105 --> 42:21.072
Hey.

42:21.106 --> 42:22.073
Hey, can I come in?

42:22.107 --> 42:23.975
Yeah.

42:24.009 --> 42:26.578
REBECCA: Morra's
everywhere, huh?
Yep.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.213
So, what's up?

42:28.246 --> 42:29.781
I could use
a cup of coffee.

42:29.815 --> 42:31.883
How about you?
Sure.

42:33.118 --> 42:36.888
(sighs)

42:36.922 --> 42:39.658
So, is, uh...

42:39.691 --> 42:41.960
is there something
on your mind?

42:41.993 --> 42:43.895
Or did your coffee maker

42:43.929 --> 42:45.931
just break?

42:47.966 --> 42:48.967
What is this?

42:49.000 --> 42:52.103
I saw you coming out
of the church last night.

42:52.137 --> 42:55.140
These are for you.

42:55.173 --> 42:58.109
You're gonna put them on,
and then you're gonna tell me

42:58.143 --> 43:01.112
what the hell is going on
between you and Senator Morra.
