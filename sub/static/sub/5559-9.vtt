WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:03.737
Previously on
Minority Report...

00:03.771 --> 00:05.439
Remember me?
My name is Wally.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.108
I'm here to help.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.710
Blomfeld thinks we never
should have ended Precrime.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.046
My agency had
plans for them.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.248
This is what I've been
seeing in my vision!

00:14.282 --> 00:15.583
A milk bath more advanced
than the one

00:15.616 --> 00:17.818
that held us
during Precrime.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.187
Memento Mori,
he was planning

00:19.220 --> 00:20.721
a terrorist attack
on the district.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.523
Coded message cards
delivered to scientists,

00:22.556 --> 00:24.058
each one stamped

00:24.092 --> 00:25.493
with the anamorphic image

00:25.526 --> 00:27.428
of a human skull.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.729
You've helped
Detective Vega.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.099
From now on, you
should be coming to me.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.133
I'll be in touch.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.635
Blake!

00:34.668 --> 00:36.137
(gunshots)

00:36.170 --> 00:38.406
You're one of them.

00:38.439 --> 00:41.242
He knows. I think he knows
who you are, too.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.643
(groans)

00:42.676 --> 00:44.712
This changes everything.

00:47.315 --> 00:51.419
(whirring and clanking)

00:51.452 --> 00:53.454
*

01:05.366 --> 01:07.135
Mr. Chairman.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.169
Quite the security setup,
Director Blomfeld.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.737
No cavity search?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.672
I hope what I have for you
is worth the inconvenience.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.874
Me, too.
For months now,

01:13.907 --> 01:15.276
I've been warning
the committee about

01:15.309 --> 01:16.677
the growing threat posed
by Memento Mori.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.146
Ah, yes, the Loch Ness monster

01:18.146 --> 01:19.413
no one's ever seen or heard

01:19.447 --> 01:20.748
except in whispers.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.350
And we've given you
carte blanche

01:22.383 --> 01:24.385
to pursue them with
every tool available.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.554
So, what did you find?
Nothing.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.758
Well, it's not a surprise.
They distrust technology.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.460
They don't leave
any online footprint.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.862
That makes them invisible
to conventional methods.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.897
So, you've been at
this almost a year,

01:36.930 --> 01:38.432
you know they're
planning something big,

01:38.466 --> 01:40.668
but have nothing
to help stop it.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.303
What's the good news?

01:42.336 --> 01:44.672
Well, Mr. Chairman,
the good news

01:44.705 --> 01:47.308
is that we have a tool
that we haven't used yet.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.178
A way to hunt this group
without a byte of data.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.446
Of course, we're missing

01:52.480 --> 01:55.516
three very important things.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.751
*

02:00.921 --> 02:03.591
(whirring)

02:11.965 --> 02:14.202
(indistinct chatter)

02:21.309 --> 02:23.711
(electronic trilling)

02:27.915 --> 02:30.484
One guess what's
in that building.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.225
We need to get busy.

02:40.394 --> 02:45.933
DASH: There are three of us:
Agatha, Arthur and me, Dash.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.402
We were called
the Precognitives.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.472
We can see murders
before they happen.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.375
For six years,
we were held against our will

02:54.408 --> 02:56.377
and used to save lives.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.580
But after the government's
Precrime program was shut down,

02:59.613 --> 03:01.582
we were finally released.

03:01.615 --> 03:05.519
We kept ourselves safe
and hidden from the world,

03:05.553 --> 03:07.388
until now.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.360
* Baby

03:12.393 --> 03:15.596
* I'm hot just like an oven

03:15.629 --> 03:18.532
* I need some lovin'
(crowd cheering)

03:18.566 --> 03:20.868
* And when I get that feeling

03:20.901 --> 03:23.437
* I want sexual healing

03:23.471 --> 03:25.706
MALE VOICE: Note missed.
* Sexual... What?!

03:25.739 --> 03:27.541
Note missed.
What are you talking about?!

03:27.575 --> 03:28.776
What do you mean, "note missed"?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.578
Song failed.
Oh...

03:30.611 --> 03:32.880
Dash!
Wow! That was amazing.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.615
I mean, oh, my God!
That was so good!

03:34.648 --> 03:36.317
That's crazy.
AKEELA:
Dash, that was...

03:36.350 --> 03:37.385
Where did you
learn to sing?

03:37.418 --> 03:38.752
Oh, come on, come on.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.288
Let's not get crazy here.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.455
All right, you took that
very serious.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.491
Let's cue up "Big Pimpin'."

03:43.524 --> 03:44.925
I'm gonna show you people
how this is done.
No, no.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.594
Vega, buy you a beer?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.896
From my own fridge?
Ooh, baller!

03:48.929 --> 03:50.598
(laughing)
BLAKE: Yeah, come on.
It's free.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.766
Akeela, start it again.
I want to sing it again.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.535
Okay.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.941
I'm glad you stopped by.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.976
You know, you lied to me.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.546
You're still not off the hook.
("Sexual Healing" begins)

04:05.579 --> 04:07.315
I don't want
off the hook.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.583
I want you on the team.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.320
Right.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.388
So...

04:14.422 --> 04:15.889
DASH:
* Baby...

04:15.923 --> 04:17.558
This is a team now?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.827
You know, you haven't
thought this through.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.596
You're worried
about your career.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.332
I get it.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.833
But this is a good thing
that we're doing.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.601
That's not what I mean.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.403
Should a power like this

04:29.437 --> 04:30.771
be in the hands
of a couple of cops?

04:30.804 --> 04:33.374
Listen, I have thought
this through.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.343
This is not like Precrime--
we're not arresting people

04:35.376 --> 04:36.577
for something
they haven't done.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.678
No, you're just
seeing the future

04:37.711 --> 04:38.946
and keeping it a secret.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.483
Who else would you trust?

04:42.516 --> 04:43.684
DASH:
* Oh, baby

04:43.717 --> 04:44.885
I don't know.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.820
* Makes me feel so fine

04:46.854 --> 04:48.722
I don't know.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.924
(sighs)

04:50.958 --> 04:53.927
* Helps to relieve my mind...

04:53.961 --> 04:56.664
But sooner or later,
somebody's gonna find out.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.766
MALE VOICE: Note missed.
AKEELA: Uh, guys?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.468
Guys!
Note missed.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.702
Wait, what's going on?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.003
VEGA:
Okay, give him some room.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.372
(Dash gasping)

05:06.407 --> 05:09.710
*

05:26.594 --> 05:28.696
(panting)

05:30.097 --> 05:31.632
Let's get to work.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.134
VEGA:
Okay.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.070
People in suits, a crowd...
BLAKE: "Tav 8"?

05:37.104 --> 05:38.672
What is that supposed to mean?
DASH: I'm not sure.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.641
It was white letters
against a blue background.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.842
Maybe a uniform?

05:41.875 --> 05:44.412
Net searches for "Tav 8"
bring up results

05:44.412 --> 05:46.414
about an antique
military aircraft.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.581
It's been retired
for decades.

05:47.615 --> 05:48.849
BLAKE:
Great.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.484
So we're looking
for a time-traveling

05:50.518 --> 05:52.119
fighter pilot, sweet.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.421
Dash's visions
aren't a police report.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.622
They're impressions.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.956
Not every detail
is a smoking gun.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.758
Tell me about this one.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.126
DASH: This guy was twisting
his wedding ring.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.961
I saw him moving
through a crowd.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.630
It looked like he was
trying to get away.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.631
The murderer?

06:03.664 --> 06:04.898
Maybe.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.867
This man dove
to protect the victim.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.669
Hmm. Black suit.
Did you see the killer's face?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.439
Not his, but I did
see the victim's.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.607
AKEELA: Steven's Law.
The Senate bill?

06:13.641 --> 06:15.108
That's Ellen Meizhou-Shi.
She's a senator

06:15.142 --> 06:16.176
from right here in the district.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.177
I voted for her.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.512
We need to have a word with her.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.913
No, let's drop by Wally's first.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.515
BLAKE: If this is a threat
on a U.S. senator,

06:21.549 --> 06:24.017
"Wally" better be the FBI.
VEGA: Blake.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.653
Let us do our thing.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.821
We'll go to the Feds
the second we know more.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.591
Besides, so far, we're having
a better year than they are.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.496
(crowd shouting, clamoring)

06:35.529 --> 06:39.132
Because our children's future
means too much to roll the dice.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.034
Pass Steven's Law.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.870
WOMAN and CHILDREN:
Life finds a way.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.204
MAN:
Excuse me.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.874
You must be
Detective Vega.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.709
That's him.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.545
And that makes you Agent Shale,
Homeland Security.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.146
Please, call me Aman.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.848
What can I do for you?

06:54.882 --> 06:57.184
Our Hawk-Eye systems
identified an orange-level

06:57.217 --> 06:58.786
threat pattern based on
a confluence of factors...

06:58.819 --> 07:00.654
We believe that
the senator is in danger.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.023
That.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.625
Any specific threat?

07:04.658 --> 07:06.193
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details yet.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.795
Well, unfortunately you don't
need predictive policing

07:07.828 --> 07:09.930
to know that the
senator has enemies.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.765
I mean, she's leading
the fight to legalize

07:11.799 --> 07:13.501
germline gene
therapy in humans.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.035
So many threats
against her life,

07:15.068 --> 07:16.770
DHS assigned
an agent to her.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.239
That's why I'm here.
Germline.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.908
Yeah, the senator could
probably explain it better,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.610
but it has something to do
with tinkering

07:22.643 --> 07:24.712
with a baby's
DNA in utero,

07:24.745 --> 07:25.979
thus stopping disease
before it happens.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.048
Kind of like pre-health.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.117
But why would anyone
have a problem with that?

07:30.150 --> 07:32.853
I ask myself that every day,
Detective...?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.021
Lara Vega.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.156
My analyst Dash Parker.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.526
These technologies
can prevent everything

07:38.559 --> 07:40.160
from MS to Parkinson's.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.095
But they also give
people the power

07:42.129 --> 07:45.232
to tweak things
for more superficial reasons.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.601
Perfect skin, eye color,

07:47.635 --> 07:49.269
the endurance
of an Olympic marathoner.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.871
Some people think
it's playing God.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.272
That's where most of
our threats come from.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.974
Extremist groups.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.175
We've taken precautions.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.744
I wish she would take more.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.212
There are crowds and protestors
everywhere we go.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.748
But the senator
won't even consider

08:00.781 --> 08:02.015
cutting back
our public schedule.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.717
Because my public
didn't send me here

08:03.751 --> 08:05.285
to back down from a fight.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.987
They sent me here to wage one.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.056
Steven's Law.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.891
Your son. He was six.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.193
He died from a genetic disorder

08:13.226 --> 08:15.062
we could've prevented
in the womb

08:15.095 --> 08:16.897
had this science been legal.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.065
I'm sorry.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.567
The gene that killed him

08:19.567 --> 08:20.601
came from me.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.035
I have to live with that.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.971
But I swore to make sure

08:24.004 --> 08:26.039
no other parent
would ever have to.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.908
VEGA:
So, this bill, uh,

08:27.941 --> 08:29.276
the vote's coming up soon?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.978
Thursday-- which
makes the next

08:31.011 --> 08:32.279
two days critical.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.814
Couple of points
of public opinion

08:33.847 --> 08:36.016
could make all the difference,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.285
so if you'll forgive me,
I have to get back to work.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.588
Nice to meet you.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.924
Where's her next public event?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.158
Ventner Labs.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.027
Press conference
here at the facility.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.597
So, if she won't cancel that,
at least let us tag along.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.265
Maybe something from our system
can help us spot the threat.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.602
Sure, the more eyes,
the better.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.905
Just please remember that
Metro PD is here to support.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.940
This is our show.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.341
No problem.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.910
And you're welcome.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.011
(chuckling)

09:04.044 --> 09:06.680
(crowd shouting, clamoring)

09:09.049 --> 09:10.350
MAN:
Senator's out front.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.719
Make a lane.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.757
MAN:
Folks, I need you
to step back.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.891
They weren't kidding
about the enemies!

09:17.925 --> 09:19.192
(woman shouting indistinctly)

09:19.226 --> 09:20.628
Thanks.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.629
WOMAN:
You're a murderer!

09:25.398 --> 09:27.100
MAN:
This way, Senator.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.201
Vega!

09:29.937 --> 09:32.172
VEGA:
Halt! Metro PD!

09:32.205 --> 09:34.107
MAN: Senator, this way!
MAN 2: Get the senator!

09:34.141 --> 09:35.943
(grunting and groaning)

09:39.747 --> 09:41.815
(grunting)

09:46.186 --> 09:47.254
(grunts)

09:51.725 --> 09:53.260
Detective, watch out!
(train whirring)

10:03.070 --> 10:04.738
You knew that guy?

10:04.772 --> 10:06.674
Who was he?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.944
ARTHUR:
Thank you for coming to me.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.080
I appreciate you calling.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.783
When we last spoke, you asked me
to contact you first

10:15.816 --> 10:17.985
instead of Vega with any...

10:18.018 --> 10:20.187
interesting information.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.656
Well, I thought you were her CI.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.957
The confidential part
was accurate.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.325
But no, I'm not
part of the team.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.327
I don't approve of what they do.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.361
Well, that makes two of us.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.397
But I do look after them.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.804
Do you know these men?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.274
Henry Blomfeld, D.I.A.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.310
The other man is...?
Tyler Reynolds.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.846
Chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.681
No wonder they gave you
the big desk.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.217
Where did you get this?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.853
Let's just say my sister and I
have been keeping tabs.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.723
Because your buddy Mr. Blomfeld
just asked permission

10:55.756 --> 10:57.791
to go hunting
for three batteries

10:57.825 --> 11:00.227
to power a new Precog milk bath.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.730
Well, if you think that I
told him who you were...

11:02.730 --> 11:04.732
You wouldn't be here
if you did.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.741
So why am I here?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.308
To stop them.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.011
You're in this with us,
whether you like it or not.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.315
Take that to Senator
Reynolds' office.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.117
Give it to one
of his staffers.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.953
He won't keep you waiting long.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.487
What is it?
Never mind that.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.356
The only thing
the senator will ask is:

11:29.389 --> 11:31.024
"How do you make it go away?"

11:31.058 --> 11:33.894
That's when you tell him
one of your CIs knows

11:33.927 --> 11:35.763
what Blomfeld asked
the committee.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.765
If their hunt
for the Precogs ends here,

11:37.765 --> 11:40.433
what's on this disk will never
see the light of day.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.302
You want to blackmail a senator?

11:42.335 --> 11:43.771
No.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.777
I want you to.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.145
Don't worry.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.814
It's more common
than you think.

11:53.847 --> 11:54.915
I'm a cop.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.785
Again, not breaking
new ground.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.387
Have you stopped
to think-- why?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.389
Why is Blomfeld
looking for you?

12:02.422 --> 12:04.491
You mean looking to enslave us.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.359
If Blomfeld needs your help,

12:06.393 --> 12:09.797
maybe, just maybe,
there's a reason.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.331
Let's pretend
you didn't say that.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.033
No, let's pretend
I never came here.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.102
For your
brother's sake.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.341
And don't contact me again.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.311
Ever.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.085
(door opens)

12:32.119 --> 12:34.287
My least favorite type of cop.

12:34.321 --> 12:37.157
Get me Deputy Chief Palmer
on the phone.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.026
He owes me.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.928
Don't worry about
Lieutenant Blake.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.264
We'll take care of that later.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.075
Deputy Director Blomfeld.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.977
Welcome to Thurn-Tippett.

12:57.010 --> 13:01.548
I imagine you're gonna need a
drink after the day you've had.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.852
Of course, the upside is,
here in civilian life,

13:04.852 --> 13:06.854
we can afford a better
grade of whiskey.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.288
Thank you, General.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.123
Eh, old job.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.892
Call me Bridge.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.494
I heard that the intelligence
committee stopped

13:14.527 --> 13:16.864
the check on your, um,
fishing expedition.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.132
Their words, not mine.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.002
Something like that.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.336
Hmm, I take it
you're not looking

13:23.370 --> 13:25.072
to transition
to the private sector.

13:25.105 --> 13:28.375
No, actually, I-I don't
think of the private sector

13:28.408 --> 13:30.443
when I think
of Thurn-Tippett.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.379
You're more like the fourth
branch of government.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.881
Except you're effective.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.148
You don't have
to kiss the ring, Henry.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.416
We know why you're here.

13:36.449 --> 13:40.087
Even though Senator
Reynolds got cold feet,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.355
you still want to find them.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.959
The greatest antiterror
tool in history,

13:45.993 --> 13:49.096
sunk by public outrage
over a procedural snafu.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.497
I mean, they never
should have been

13:50.530 --> 13:51.932
entrusted to local
law enforcement.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.601
Next time, we keep
the civilians out.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.636
I'm listening.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.639
The question is what
to do with the Precogs

13:59.672 --> 14:01.909
when I find them.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.911
Without the committee,
there's no government support

14:03.911 --> 14:05.212
for long-term
containment.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.346
A true waste.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.915
My thoughts exactly.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.183
Of course, Thurn-Tippett
is only a contractor,

14:10.217 --> 14:12.052
so we couldn't
possibly intervene

14:12.085 --> 14:13.386
in a government operation.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.356
However, if certain
military--

14:16.389 --> 14:19.026
shall we say surplus?--
became available,

14:19.059 --> 14:22.930
that would undoubtedly be
an asset we'd like to own.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.032
Undoubtedly.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.336
AKEELA:
This was all that I could pull

14:29.369 --> 14:30.670
from the surveillance feeds.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.671
Look like your runner?

14:31.704 --> 14:32.973
VEGA:
That's him.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.975
Who is he?
Uh, space alien?

14:35.008 --> 14:37.110
AKEELA: There's no match
to any record in the system.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.112
That sounds familiar.
Akeela, what if you
only searched

14:39.146 --> 14:41.214
faces with no
recognition results?

14:41.248 --> 14:42.950
Say, the last
seven days,

14:42.950 --> 14:43.984
across all cameras
in the district.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.418
Smart, V.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.455
Let's see.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.624
Huh, this guy might not have
any record in the system,

14:51.658 --> 14:53.226
but he is out there.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.295
Looks like his movement
pattern shows

14:55.328 --> 14:57.564
four to five solid clusters,
places he shows up frequently.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.167
A hospital, a high school
and restaurants.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.970
What do all these places
have in common?

15:02.970 --> 15:04.237
As far as I can tell,
just our guy.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.973
So who is he?
(cell phone beeps)

15:05.973 --> 15:08.641
It's Arthur.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.011
He's finally getting
back to you.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.345
Does he have a name?

15:12.379 --> 15:13.546
No, he wants to talk.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.458
ARTHUR: I know why you
wanted to reach me,

15:25.492 --> 15:26.726
but the last thing
I'm going to do

15:26.759 --> 15:28.595
is help you save a U.S. senator,

15:28.628 --> 15:31.098
so let's just get that
out of the way now.
Why?

15:34.001 --> 15:36.369
This is the Senate
Committee on Intelligence,

15:36.403 --> 15:39.006
touring the contents of
a secret D.I.A. facility.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.309
We've been watching
this location

15:42.342 --> 15:44.311
since I got the blueprints
for the milk bath.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.612
Agatha.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.147
VEGA: It's good
to see you.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.449
Wish I could
say the same.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.018
Look familiar?

15:51.018 --> 15:53.686
They're coming for us.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.091
DASH:
It's Blomfeld.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.093
He came by the precinct,
vetting Hawk-Eye.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.261
He's looking for us?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.130
Requesting approval.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.531
Luckily, I managed
to shut it down.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.499
For now.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.136
But you met the man--
does he seem like a quitter?

16:09.169 --> 16:11.371
So what do you want me to do?

16:11.404 --> 16:12.572
Stop.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.141
This case.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.309
And the next one.
Retire.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.348
I walked into an ambush.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.051
An intervention-- you need
to quit before you kill us all.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.285
I'm not gonna do that.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.719
The senator, the
work she's doing,

16:26.753 --> 16:28.255
the law she's
fighting for--

16:28.288 --> 16:30.323
it could be responsible
for saving millions.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.192
I need to help.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.527
No.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.529
They're right.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.131
What?

16:38.165 --> 16:39.499
It's too risky.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.068
For all of you.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.070
Yeah... but without
my visions...

16:43.103 --> 16:44.471
I'm still a cop, aren't I?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.573
Before we met,
I thought

16:46.606 --> 16:48.675
having a Precog
was the greatest tool

16:48.708 --> 16:50.777
a cop could ever have.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.345
I used you.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.083
You are so much more than that.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.317
You didn't use me.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.119
I volunteered,
and we saved lives.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.222
Yes, we did, and when it was
on the line, you saved mine.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.623
Both of you.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.595
You've done enough
for five lifetimes.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.563
What are you saying?

17:12.599 --> 17:15.335
I'm saying maybe I need to get
used to working alone again.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.270
And maybe you should
start thinking

17:17.304 --> 17:18.771
about a different line of work.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.580
I have to go.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.586
She's right, Dash.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.455
You've done enough.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.726
I don't know about that.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.628
But definitely more
than you two.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.135
Where's Vega?

17:48.135 --> 17:50.503
Uh...

17:50.537 --> 17:52.505
She doesn't know
that I'm here.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.141
She didn't think
it would be safe.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.443
Safe?
Some D.I.A. agent
is looking for us.

17:56.476 --> 17:59.479
Arthur wanted me to lay low.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.215
(scoffs)
Maybe you should.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.651
Dash...

18:04.684 --> 18:06.153
They're my visions.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.420
And it's my risk.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.156
And I'm willing
to take it.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.191
Are you gonna help or not?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.173
WALLY:
See anything new?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.175
DASH:
The senator and Shale we know.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.709
And that's the guy
from yesterday.

18:29.742 --> 18:30.910
The man in blue.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.512
T-A-V-8.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.247
Some kind
of acronym?

18:34.281 --> 18:36.683
It's a military aircraft,
but look at the letters.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.785
Why are they blurry?

18:38.818 --> 18:42.322
We are looking at a homemade
brain scan of a future vision.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.656
Beggars can't be choosers.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.891
No, it's not
just a blur.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.659
It's...

18:46.693 --> 18:48.195
it's a double image.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.698
It's a reflection.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.233
It's not Tav 8,
it's 8 Vat.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.703
8 Vat Industries.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.871
It's the name of
a commercial vat-grown

18:58.905 --> 19:00.773
meat distributor
right here in D.C.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.309
I need to show this to Vega.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.311
WALLY (sighs):
She's gonna be pissed.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.546
Well, she can do that all she
wants after we stop a murder.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.881
(beeping)

19:08.915 --> 19:11.751
(knocking on door)

19:11.784 --> 19:13.453
(whispering):
Were you expecting someone?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.927
Friends of yours?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.629
(knocking on door)

19:22.662 --> 19:23.863
Not exactly.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.647
Mr. Wallace?

19:41.981 --> 19:44.251
Norbert Wallace?

19:44.251 --> 19:45.885
Yeah.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.787
Henry Blomfeld, D.I.A.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.789
May I come in?
Well, that depends.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.391
What's your trumped up
pretext for being here?

19:53.260 --> 19:54.827
That's confidential.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.266
WALLY: What is this?
Where's your warrant?

19:59.266 --> 20:01.000
BLOMFELD:
Would you be surprised to know

20:01.033 --> 20:03.470
that your name came up in
connection with a terror treat?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.338
WALLY: Terror?
I'm a game designer.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.340
Oh, then you won't mind
us having a gander

20:07.374 --> 20:08.708
at your system here.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.412
Actually, I value privacy.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.449
(Blomfeld chuckles)

20:16.483 --> 20:19.252
Is this an alphanumeric
password? No biometrics?

20:19.286 --> 20:21.020
Biometrics have a nasty habit
of encouraging bad guys

20:21.053 --> 20:23.590
to cut off
the relevant body part.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.259
Well, there's also ways
to find out passwords.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.730
Or you can make it easy.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.599
Try "I hate cops."

20:32.632 --> 20:34.567
But with a four for the "A"
and a one for the "I."

20:36.336 --> 20:37.504
I'm not on any terror list.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.805
That's not why
you're here.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.540
And, by the way,
you should know

20:40.573 --> 20:41.974
you're messing
with the wrong guy.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.743
(audio fading): Unlike
most people you harass,

20:43.776 --> 20:45.812
I can still afford to
hire a team of lawyers.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.514
I know my rights.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.616
(sighs)
All right, Mr. Wallace.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.419
I'll level with you-- the terror
threat that I mentioned happens

20:52.452 --> 20:54.954
to be very real, but, no,
your name did not come up

20:54.987 --> 20:56.556
as a suspect--
I think you can help.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.625
Help you?
All of us.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.627
I have access to the Precrime
records. I know you worked there

21:00.660 --> 21:03.330
for the full duration
of the program.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.764
You knew the Precogs.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.800
Sure.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.068
Like you can know a pet.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.670
I took care of them
as bodies.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.339
I-I cut their hair
and I brushed their teeth.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.341
BLOMFELD:
You haven't seen them since?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.708
I was their jailer.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.943
You think they'd come to me?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.846
The answer is no.

21:19.879 --> 21:23.750
But I'd be the last person
you'd tell, if they had.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.686
You're a technical genius,
aren't you, Mr. Wallace?

21:26.719 --> 21:28.488
WALLY:
Well, I can shut down
a local ASIC node

21:28.521 --> 21:30.390
without consulting the manual,
if that's what you mean.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.492
Have you heard of the group
Memento Mori?

21:32.525 --> 21:35.061
WALLY:
Sounds like a name
I would remember.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.663
What would you say
if I told you

21:36.696 --> 21:37.897
that we're facing
a terrorist group

21:37.930 --> 21:40.433
who somehow made
themselves invisible,

21:40.467 --> 21:42.869
despite the best efforts of
government intelligence?

21:42.902 --> 21:44.404
Government intelligence--

21:44.437 --> 21:46.573
that's an oxymoron.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.743
Invisible?

21:50.777 --> 21:51.944
Not an e-mail.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.045
Not an IP packet.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.647
Not a single
face rec ping.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.383
That all-seeing electronic
surveillance state

21:56.383 --> 21:57.984
that you're
so afraid of--

21:58.017 --> 22:00.119
they move right through it
as if it wasn't even there.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.855
Now, they are planning
something big, Mr. Wallace,

22:02.889 --> 22:04.691
and the Precogs could
be our only hope

22:04.724 --> 22:06.025
to see it
before it hits us.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.894
The last time
men in suits wanted help

22:07.927 --> 22:10.062
from the Precogs,
they were 14.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.865
They told them they'd be
volunteering to save lives

22:12.899 --> 22:16.569
and that they'd only spend
a couple weeks in the milk bath.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.506
Eight years later,
they let them go.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.907
And if some had their way,

22:20.940 --> 22:22.108
they never would have
freed them.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.911
I happen to be
one of those people.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.082
I'm sorry.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.084
Wish I could help.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.454
Hmm.
Have it your way.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.655
Search the place,
top to bottom.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.424
Pack up all of his gear.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.158
You can't do that.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.127
This is a matter of national
security, Mr. Wallace.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.895
There's really very little
that I can't do.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.866
(electrical whirring
and crackling)

22:47.734 --> 22:50.570
(crackling and buzzing)

22:55.842 --> 22:58.478
Induction coils
in the door frames.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.680
In case thieves
steal my equipment.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.116
Guess I forgot
to mention that.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.854
But, uh, good luck with
your investigation.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.657
Let's go.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.767
What are you doing here?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.102
Coming out of
retirement.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.672
With the life expectancy
at 104.5 years,

23:25.705 --> 23:27.874
my money's gonna run out
by the time I turn 36.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.009
Dash...
Henry Blomfeld was at Wally's.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.578
What?

23:33.179 --> 23:35.748
He is definitely
looking for the Precogs, Vega.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.517
He thinks that
we might be

23:37.550 --> 23:40.019
the only way to stop some
terror group, Memento...

23:40.052 --> 23:41.954
Mori.
Memento Mori.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.155
You've heard of them?

23:43.189 --> 23:44.724
Blomfeld mentioned some chatter.

23:44.757 --> 23:45.892
He said that they were
planning an attack.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.495
What if it's true?

23:48.495 --> 23:50.963
What if he's right?
What if we could help?

23:50.997 --> 23:53.199
By coming forward.
It's a dangerous world, Dash.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.801
That doesn't make
every threat out there

23:54.834 --> 23:55.935
your responsibility.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.704
I stop one more.
No.

23:57.737 --> 23:58.905
I stop one more,
and then I'm done.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.540
I'm out.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.008
For good.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.885
Let me worry about Blomfeld.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.526
I got a call
from your other special friend.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.193
Arthur?
Yeah.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.195
Charming guy. He thinks
Blomfeld's looking for them.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.931
He's right.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.600
Well, you won't believe
what he asked me to do about it.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.235
This is their lives, Will.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.570
Mine, too.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.104
And I won't
throw that away.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.206
You think this is
just a job to me?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.775
A fancy office?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.076
Blomfeld showed up at Wally's.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.546
Dash was there.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.880
How?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.749
How did he find him?
He didn't.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.150
But the real problem is...

24:44.183 --> 24:45.585
Wait, that wasn't
the real problem?

24:45.618 --> 24:46.719
The real problem is

24:46.753 --> 24:47.720
we don't know how close he is.

24:47.754 --> 24:48.988
How much he knows.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.222
Is he just fishing
through old files,

24:50.256 --> 24:51.758
or does he really have a lead?

24:53.259 --> 24:55.962
You have to ask him.
Me?

24:55.995 --> 24:58.197
You, too, now?
You have a relationship...

24:58.230 --> 25:00.733
No. No, Vega,
I'm not here to protect...

25:02.569 --> 25:03.870
I'm not here to protect Precogs.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.705
That's your job.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.574
We're in this together.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.941
No.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.010
I'm caught up in all this
because of you.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.880
My job is to uphold the law,
not to break it.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.082
Well, I thought our job
was to save lives.
All by ourselves?

25:16.115 --> 25:18.084
If Blomfeld is looking
for the Precogs,

25:18.117 --> 25:20.219
he must think they can help.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.655
And if you're suggesting
that we turn Dash in...
No.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.824
No, I get it. He's your friend.
You sing karaoke.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.726
But what if protecting him

25:26.759 --> 25:28.127
means other people die?

25:28.160 --> 25:31.731
Could you really
live with that?

25:31.764 --> 25:33.633
Could he?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.670
That isn't gonna happen.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.639
Right.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.973
Because you say so.

25:41.007 --> 25:44.010
If you really want
to protect Dash,

25:44.043 --> 25:46.613
tell him to stay
the hell away from you.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.057
How'd it go with Blake?
Better than expected.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.859
Akeela, what've we got?

25:59.892 --> 26:01.661
8 Vat Industries,

26:01.694 --> 26:04.030
a sustainable purveyor
of vat-grown meat.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.633
And this is a map of their
distribution network.

26:06.633 --> 26:09.201
DASH:
And look whose recent movement
pattern it matches perfectly.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.137
Maybe our guy runs the truck.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.905
If so, he's scheduled to make
a catering delivery

26:12.939 --> 26:14.674
tomorrow night, to Ventner Labs.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.809
Just before the senator visits
for a photo op.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.811
That must be how
he gets close to her.

26:18.845 --> 26:21.047
No. That's how we're
gonna catch him.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.352
Bust in?

26:26.385 --> 26:28.154
Well, we can't just break in

26:28.187 --> 26:31.023
unless we see
someone in distress.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.261
Looks like someone
in distress to me.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.999
(device buzzing)

26:40.032 --> 26:42.034
(metallic ringing)

26:42.068 --> 26:43.770
(hinges creaking)

26:47.073 --> 26:49.075
*

27:14.801 --> 27:18.104
So this is where meat
comes from?

27:18.137 --> 27:20.239
VEGA:
Yeah, it's hard to believe

27:20.272 --> 27:22.341
this stuff used to come
from living cows, right?

27:24.711 --> 27:25.878
Look at this gear.

27:25.912 --> 27:28.247
DNA sequencer.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.949
Synthesizer.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.256
We just missed him.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.796
This book...

27:43.830 --> 27:45.998
What? What is it?

27:46.032 --> 27:49.335
It was in the package that came
through the Sprawl last week.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.003
I thought
we examined it.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.872
"A. T. C. G."

27:52.905 --> 27:53.973
That's DNA.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.474
He must be using this equipment

27:55.507 --> 27:57.944
to synthesize something.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.415
Memento Mori.

28:03.449 --> 28:06.185
This is bigger
than just the senator.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.756
DASH:
Stop! Stop!

28:11.190 --> 28:13.325
Get back!

28:13.359 --> 28:15.094
(whirring, explosive whoosh)

28:18.264 --> 28:21.400
(grunting, panting)

28:21.433 --> 28:24.170
*

28:39.118 --> 28:40.352
Blake...

28:40.386 --> 28:42.121
Remember how I told you,

28:42.154 --> 28:44.490
if I found out info
about the senator's assassin,

28:44.523 --> 28:46.192
that you could tell the Feds?

28:48.327 --> 28:50.196
BLAKE:
Memento Mori. That's
the symbol you showed us

28:50.229 --> 28:52.531
at the briefing,
isn't it?
You think this is linked

28:52.564 --> 28:54.801
to a threat against
Senator Meizhou-Shi?

28:54.834 --> 28:56.068
Well, Detective Vega found this

28:56.102 --> 28:57.403
in the possession
of our suspect.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.538
Goes by the alias
Doug Hartsock,

28:59.571 --> 29:01.040
according to
his employer.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.109
He got away?
Yes.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.177
But we found a part
of a DNA sequence.

29:06.946 --> 29:09.248
How did Detective Vega know
about the suspect?

29:09.281 --> 29:11.951
Confidential informant.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.221
Well, you did the right thing
coming to me.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.823
I'm gonna need a copy of this.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.360
Uh, sir?

29:21.393 --> 29:23.896
May I ask you
a question?

29:25.164 --> 29:26.999
If Memento Mori
stays off the Net,

29:27.033 --> 29:28.534
how do we plan to track them?

29:33.339 --> 29:35.307
You remember Precrime,
Lieutenant?

29:36.508 --> 29:37.877
Of course.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.078
It was mishandled.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.346
That won't happen the next time.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.115
The next time?

29:43.149 --> 29:45.017
Do you mean you are
looking for the Precogs?

29:45.051 --> 29:46.919
It means I'm keeping
all my options open.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.321
Because I don't want
the first thing we learn

29:49.355 --> 29:51.858
about a Memento Mori attack
to be the body count.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.237
You really think it was safe
to bring Blomfeld here?

30:05.271 --> 30:07.073
Well, if he knew Dash's face,
he would've come

30:07.106 --> 30:08.474
for him already.
DASH: At least this way

30:08.507 --> 30:10.276
Blake can warn us
if he gets close.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.544
Assuming we can trust Blake.
Like it or not, we already are.

30:12.578 --> 30:15.848
What have you got?
Results from
the crime scene sweep

30:15.882 --> 30:17.049
at the meat facility.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.550
One DNA match unaccounted for.

30:18.584 --> 30:19.886
Our suspect,

30:19.919 --> 30:22.054
Mr. Hartsock?
Might be an alias.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.090
This guy's a doctor--
Lionel Gray.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.257
That's not him.
Weird, right?

30:25.291 --> 30:26.959
The picture's
a few years old,

30:26.993 --> 30:28.194
but the DNA match is perfect.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.029
He changed his face.
Could be.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.964
Plastic surgery.
Extensive.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.165
And excellent.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.266
Okay, so who is he?

30:34.300 --> 30:36.068
Or... was he?

30:36.102 --> 30:39.471
Graduated summa cum laude
from Harvey Mudd at 19, and then

30:39.505 --> 30:42.108
a biochem PhD
from Harvard at 23.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.375
It says his wife Marie died

30:43.409 --> 30:45.411
before he finished
his doctorate.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.114
And then he left the country.
Took an assistant
professorship

30:48.147 --> 30:50.182
at Seoul National University,
where he pioneered

30:50.216 --> 30:53.452
new methods for genome editing
with engineered nucleases.

30:53.485 --> 30:56.055
Okay, explain that to me
like I didn't go to MIT.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.190
The same science
the senator supports--

30:58.224 --> 31:00.259
he practically invented it.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.660
And then in 2051,

31:01.693 --> 31:04.096
at the ripe age of 36,

31:04.130 --> 31:06.332
he resigned
from the university

31:06.365 --> 31:08.667
and dropped completely
off the radar.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.036
To follow his dream
of delivering

31:10.069 --> 31:12.204
fake meat?
Or to have access

31:12.238 --> 31:15.374
to their toys in order
to synthesize whatever
that DNA code was for.

31:15.407 --> 31:16.675
My money's
on a cute little puppy.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.210
Or a biological weapon.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.611
Or that.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.547
But unfortunately,
most of the pages were ashes,

31:21.580 --> 31:23.249
so we don't get
the whole sequence.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.583
Maybe we stopped him
before he finished making it.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.452
No.
You're still seeing the murder.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.454
Not as clearly.

31:28.487 --> 31:29.989
We intervened.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.324
That makes it harder
to see how it happens,

31:32.358 --> 31:34.560
but I still see her die.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.428
What about Gray,
the blue uniform?

31:36.462 --> 31:38.197
Are you still seeing him?
Not anymore.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.066
He must get to
her another way.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.201
Maybe we can get back to Wally's
and scrub my brain again?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.136
No, it's not an option.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.537
Not with Blomfeld
sniffing around.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.676
We just found a way
to make this even tougher.

31:50.709 --> 31:53.712
BLOMFELD: Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.714
I've come to learn
that people don't like

31:55.747 --> 31:58.184
to deliver bad news in person.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.120
I hope this isn't
an exception to the rule.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.454
You're right.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.023
I have another lead.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.128
Charles Peele.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.197
He used to work for you.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.532
Before he embezzled over a
million dollars and disappeared.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.234
You caught him?

32:15.267 --> 32:16.568
Several weeks ago,
he infiltrated

32:16.602 --> 32:18.137
a high-security
D.I.A. facility.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.371
He accessed
the blueprints

32:19.405 --> 32:21.007
for our photonic
containment system.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.608
The milk bath.
Mm-hmm.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.510
You think he's a Precog?
Or working for one.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.312
He was gunned down
by U.S. marshals

32:26.345 --> 32:27.479
before we could
interrogate him.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.282
Pity.
Hmm, maybe not.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.618
His last known location
was an island

32:32.651 --> 32:34.453
off the Carolina coast--
Fiddler's Neck.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.055
Neighbors saw
him talking

32:36.088 --> 32:38.490
to a woman the day
he disappeared. Blonde.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.592
Keeps to herself.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.628
They say her name is Agatha.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.532
Find her.

32:46.565 --> 32:49.235
(clamoring)

32:49.268 --> 32:51.270
(applause)

32:55.741 --> 32:57.109
All right, people, here we go.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.378
Not seeing Gray.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.048
(cheering)

33:03.049 --> 33:04.516
Thank you.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.490
Thank you all for coming.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.693
As many of you know,
I am a religious person.

33:14.726 --> 33:18.430
And my church's position has
always been that life is sacred.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.732
For hundreds of years, from

33:20.766 --> 33:24.736
Galileo to Ventner,
this meant opposing science.

33:24.770 --> 33:27.539
But I'm proud to say
that in recent years,

33:27.573 --> 33:30.142
the church has come to see
just how much science can do

33:30.176 --> 33:32.378
to safeguard life

33:32.411 --> 33:35.681
and eliminate suffering
for the weakest among us.

33:35.714 --> 33:39.285
And now I'd like for you
to meet my heroes.

34:04.410 --> 34:07.413
Each of them is suffering
from a genetic illness

34:07.446 --> 34:10.582
that this bill
would eliminate.

34:10.616 --> 34:14.486
Now, it's too late for many
of them, but these brave souls

34:14.520 --> 34:16.822
have dedicated their last months

34:16.855 --> 34:20.159
to ensuring others
won't suffer as they have.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.293
VEGA:
Lenses, show thermal.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.461
Agent Shale,

34:22.494 --> 34:23.662
do we have anyone stationed

34:23.695 --> 34:25.264
in the mezzanine level?

34:25.297 --> 34:27.266
Should be empty.
That area's been secured.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.470
Vega, what is it?

34:31.503 --> 34:34.206
(Meizhou-Shi continues
indistinctly in distance)

34:34.240 --> 34:35.841
(grunting)

34:47.286 --> 34:48.754
Shale, he's in.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.622
He's in.
What are you talking about?

34:50.656 --> 34:53.192
There's a man here, unconscious.
Looks like one of the patients.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.294
He must be in the building.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.163
I don't see him.
All points, we're on high alert.

34:57.163 --> 34:58.564
The suspect
may be in the building.

35:00.399 --> 35:03.569
MEIZHOU-SHI:
And I believe you will, too.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.903
Far left, wheelchair.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.805
MEIZHOU-SHI:
God bless you, and God bless

35:06.838 --> 35:08.307
these American heroes.
It's him.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.641
Get down, get down!
Grab him!

35:09.675 --> 35:11.177
Whoa, no, no, no!
Grab him!

35:11.210 --> 35:12.411
DASH:
No! I'm with the police.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.712
Move, move! Move!

35:13.745 --> 35:15.847
Forgive me, Senator.
(grunts)

35:15.881 --> 35:18.317
Get down!
(people shrieking)

35:18.350 --> 35:19.418
(grunting)

35:19.451 --> 35:21.253
Move, move!

35:21.287 --> 35:22.888
Senator, are you okay--
are you hit?

35:22.921 --> 35:25.624
I'm-I'm fine.
I... I think I'm fine.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.394
No.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.895
You're not.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.431
What, what? What is
he talking about?

35:33.665 --> 35:35.201
Your eyes.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.404
Get her to a hospital now.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.273
Get me a secure exit. Go! Go!

35:49.815 --> 35:51.817
(door opens)

35:57.656 --> 35:59.291
Whatever it is, they're saying

35:59.325 --> 36:02.361
somehow it modified her DNA
in real time.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.763
Permission to interrogate
the suspect, Lieutenant.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.632
Not my call.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.668
Until my boss gets here.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.437
After you.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.690
How's the senator?

36:31.723 --> 36:34.260
You know exactly how she is.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.827
What did you do to her?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.829
Nothing...

36:37.863 --> 36:39.431
she wouldn't have done
to millions of others.

36:39.465 --> 36:40.766
Others?

36:40.799 --> 36:42.601
She just wants to cure disease.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.770
We've all been there, Detective.

36:44.803 --> 36:48.740
A loved one gets sick,
like the senator's son,

36:48.774 --> 36:52.278
every cell in our body
wants to help them.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.280
So you tried to save your wife,
you failed,

36:54.313 --> 36:55.747
and now you're mad at the world?

36:55.781 --> 36:57.949
If that makes it easier
for you to understand.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.687
No. Your wife died years before

37:01.720 --> 37:03.822
you resigned tenure
and disappeared.

37:03.855 --> 37:07.393
You wanted to keep others
from suffering the same pain.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.794
Same as the senator.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.762
Oh, I don't blame her,
Detective.

37:10.796 --> 37:13.732
She's just weak.
We all are.

37:13.765 --> 37:17.569
Wanting to interfere
with the inevitable.

37:19.037 --> 37:21.307
With death.

37:22.808 --> 37:25.311
Memento Mori.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.613
Latin. It means...

37:27.646 --> 37:29.381
Remember you will die.

37:29.415 --> 37:30.749
The early Christians

37:30.782 --> 37:32.918
used the symbol of the skull
as a reminder

37:32.951 --> 37:35.454
that all things in this world
are fleeting.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.756
That the things we build...
That the things we build

37:37.789 --> 37:39.691
can easily destroy us.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.861
We won't be needing you
any longer.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.364
Thanks, but I'll stay.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.866
At Harvard, our lab

37:47.899 --> 37:51.036
worked with
Drosophila melanogaster,

37:51.069 --> 37:53.372
the common fruit fly.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.907
We were working
on genetic change.

37:55.941 --> 37:59.578
Could have led to a
vaccine for cancer.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.347
Just... ended it.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.482
Once and for all.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.651
What happened?
Didn't work.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.753
It would have, but...

38:07.786 --> 38:09.955
I mis-entered the sequence.

38:09.988 --> 38:12.691
A single C
instead of a G.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.927
I was tired.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.530
You must understand

38:18.564 --> 38:22.000
what it is to live your job
night and day.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.936
I do.
Instead
of immunity

38:24.970 --> 38:28.106
to cancer, the flies
passed it on to their children.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.075
Their life cycle is 14 hours.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.844
Each female lays 500 eggs.

38:32.878 --> 38:36.515
In three days,
every fly on campus was dead.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.916
So you're
doing this

38:37.949 --> 38:39.685
because you got sloppy
in the lab

38:39.718 --> 38:41.987
and killed
a bunch of fruit flies?
Lab?

38:42.020 --> 38:44.656
No, this science happens
at room temperature

38:44.690 --> 38:47.058
with six of the most
common elements on Earth.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.860
This could have
happened anywhere.

38:48.894 --> 38:51.463
So you're thinking is,
if Steven's Law passes,

38:51.497 --> 38:53.499
a motivated high school student

38:53.532 --> 38:55.967
will be able to wipe out
an entire species?

38:56.001 --> 38:58.504
No.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.672
Humanity.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.612
Those are the stakes, Detective.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.113
And you're thinking
that by murdering

39:08.146 --> 39:09.615
a U.S. senator
you can

39:09.648 --> 39:11.583
get your point out.
I hope so.

39:11.617 --> 39:14.152
For all of our sakes.
Well,
you can see

39:14.185 --> 39:16.422
where the label "twisted"
will precede "genius"

39:16.455 --> 39:17.823
in your obituary.

39:20.592 --> 39:23.862
Um, if you're recommending
a publicist, I'm all ears.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.130
What's gonna happen to her?

39:25.163 --> 39:27.098
The viral vector
that landed on her skin

39:27.132 --> 39:29.034
will change her
pigment first.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.169
Carcinoma.
Then deeper tissues.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.971
Her immune system
will do the rest.

39:33.004 --> 39:36.942
Biology is so
deliciously messy.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.009
How do we stop it?

39:38.043 --> 39:39.445
You don't.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.448
You can't.

39:42.448 --> 39:45.517
But if Congress moves forward
with this bill

39:45.551 --> 39:47.953
after seeing what
this technology can do,

39:47.986 --> 39:50.789
the senator's just
going to be the beginning.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.924
Who else are you working with?

39:52.958 --> 39:55.461
Others with a conscience.
Scientists.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.529
Men and women
who truly understand

39:57.563 --> 39:58.897
what this kind
of tampering

39:58.930 --> 40:00.932
with life can do.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.672
I'm not a monster, Detective.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.840
And believe
it or not,

40:08.874 --> 40:11.142
I'm the one who'll
save us from ourselves.

40:11.176 --> 40:12.210
(door opens)

40:12.243 --> 40:14.613
BLAKE:
Vega.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.648
You need to see this.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.122
AKEELA:
It's the senator.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.791
Her face.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.494
The viral vector
changed the pigment.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.961
It was hard-coded
to her DNA.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.030
She fell into a coma
20 minutes ago.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.134
Just the first, Detectives.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.772
I hope not the first of many.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.946
Andromeda,
who is it?

40:53.819 --> 40:55.554
Agatha?

40:56.655 --> 40:58.256
They came to the island--

40:58.289 --> 41:00.892
Blomfeld
and his men.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.028
They found you?

41:03.061 --> 41:05.531
I just barely got away.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.000
It's happening.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.771
We need to be ready.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.906
I saw it again.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.843
*

41:27.719 --> 41:29.254
Put them in.
