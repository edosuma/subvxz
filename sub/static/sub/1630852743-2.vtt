<i>[narrator] Previously on
Worst Cooks in America...</i>

00:02.670 --> 00:04.330
- Woo-hoo!
- You are all known

00:04.330 --> 00:06.800
<i>for the disastrous things
you've done in the kitchen.</i>

00:06.800 --> 00:08.000
[both scream]

00:08.000 --> 00:09.400
This always is very scary.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.140
- Aye!
- You gotta slap it a little bit.

00:11.140 --> 00:12.270
Like, game meat, right.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.810
I'm trying to get it off
the damn grill!

00:13.810 --> 00:17.110
<i>[Anne] We're gonna show you
guys how to make surf and turf dinner.</i>

00:17.110 --> 00:18.750
How do you stop a fire
when it's inside the pot?

00:18.750 --> 00:20.150
[Cliff] Anne and I have decided

00:20.150 --> 00:23.480
- it's just too soon to send anyone home.
- [all cheering]

00:23.490 --> 00:25.920
<i>[narrator] You're about to
enter another dimension.</i>

00:25.920 --> 00:28.220
<i>A dimension of time and space.</i>

00:28.220 --> 00:31.990
<i>A dimension of overcooked
meat and bad knife cuts.</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:35.160
<i>You've crossed over
into The Bad Food Zone.</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:37.260
<i>- Picture, if you will...
- Oh, that's a fire!</i>

00:37.270 --> 00:39.100
All of it,
it just disintegrated.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.230
<i>Two master chefs.</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:43.100
This is not what I thought.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.100
<i>Anne Burrell.</i>

00:44.110 --> 00:45.940
- Yeah!
- Ah!

00:45.940 --> 00:47.780
<i>And newcomer Chef Cliff Crooks</i>

00:47.780 --> 00:49.140
<i>as himself...</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:50.310
Feel like I'm living
my worst nightmare right now.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.280
Oh, damn it! It's still on!

00:52.280 --> 00:54.350
<i>Who must transform
these poor souls</i>

00:54.980 --> 00:56.080
<i>from TV dinners...</i>

00:56.090 --> 00:58.090
- [Anne] Are you stirring with a fork?
- No.

00:58.090 --> 00:59.890
<i>To kitchen winners.</i>

00:59.890 --> 01:02.320
- This is delicious.
<i>- [narrator] Some are total strangers.</i>

01:02.320 --> 01:03.290
- [rumbling]
- Pulp, pulp, pulp, pulp.

01:03.290 --> 01:04.290
These hips don't shake.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.660
[narrator]
<i>Others, old friends.</i>

01:05.660 --> 01:07.130
- No!
- No, no. It's that one up there.

01:07.130 --> 01:11.230
<i>[narrator] But only one person
will escape with $25,000.</i>

01:11.230 --> 01:14.470
- [all screaming]
- [laughs] I'm living my dream!

01:14.470 --> 01:16.370
<i>[narrator] A culinary
nightmare so bad...</i>

01:16.370 --> 01:17.340
Put the water in.

01:17.340 --> 01:18.540
- Water, water...
- Wow!

01:18.540 --> 01:21.110
<i>[narrator] I can't even do
this impression anymore.</i>

01:21.110 --> 01:23.010
Ew! Salmonella everywhere.

01:23.010 --> 01:25.010
I am having a heart attack.

01:25.010 --> 01:27.310
<i>- [narrator] Next up...
- I'm a goblin.</i>

01:27.320 --> 01:28.650
[narrator]
Worst Cooks in America,

01:29.450 --> 01:31.220
<i>The Disaster Zone.</i>

01:32.920 --> 01:34.190
- [laughing]
- Oh, my...

01:34.190 --> 01:35.960
- Oh...
- Oh, God.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.330
We go into the kitchen
and it has turned into a...

01:39.330 --> 01:42.360
<i>full gladiator arena.</i>

01:42.360 --> 01:44.670
It is the Colosseum.

01:44.670 --> 01:49.300
<i>We are being transported back to a
full hand-on-hand combat battlefield.</i>

01:49.310 --> 01:51.870
It is boot camp for real, baby.

01:51.870 --> 01:55.210
- I'm gonna break an ankle.
- This is going to be interesting.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.440
Welcome to the arena, recruits.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.350
Or should I say gladiators?

01:59.350 --> 02:01.380
- [all cheering]
- Gladiators.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.320
- Yeah.
- While you know some of the basics,

02:04.320 --> 02:07.550
you're all a long way from
becoming Kitchen Warriors.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.260
- Real.
- [laughing]

02:09.260 --> 02:11.860
In fact, you're all used to being on
the losing end of battles with food.

02:11.860 --> 02:12.890
- Yeah.
- Yes.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.390
Today, we're gonna
kick things off

02:14.400 --> 02:17.830
with a series of games
that will transform you into

02:17.830 --> 02:19.670
fierce food fighters.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.470
[Cliff] Today, we'll be
testing your stamina,

02:23.470 --> 02:25.310
speed, agility

02:25.310 --> 02:26.640
and your palates,

02:26.640 --> 02:30.140
all to see who has what
it takes to be the next

02:30.150 --> 02:32.310
America Culinary Warrior.

02:32.310 --> 02:35.680
[all cheering]

02:35.680 --> 02:39.750
For each round, two recruits from
each team will step up to compete.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.190
Whichever pair wins the event
will win a point for their team.

02:44.190 --> 02:46.260
The team with
the most points at the end

02:46.260 --> 02:49.900
will take home the win and an
advantage in the next challenge.

02:49.900 --> 02:50.760
- Ooh!
- [all clapping]

02:50.770 --> 02:52.170
[Hilda] We got that.
We gotta win this.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.940
- Don't let me down, Blue Team.
- Red Team is going down.

02:54.940 --> 02:57.070
I'm looking at you
my rocking red stars.

02:57.070 --> 02:58.670
- We got you.
- Guys...

02:59.410 --> 03:01.140
We're getting you, peaches.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.680
You're a bruised peach.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.250
- [chuckling]
- So, I'm extra sweet!

03:05.250 --> 03:07.680
- They turned on each other so quickly.
- They're-- instantly.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.180
All right, team,

03:10.850 --> 03:12.390
<i>show 'em what you're made of</i>

03:12.390 --> 03:14.120
<i>and let the games begin.</i>

03:15.220 --> 03:18.990
All right, recruits, our first
event is called Wheels Up.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.200
So, using your palates, you
must taste and then recreate

03:22.200 --> 03:23.400
these smoothies.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.370
But, you're gonna have to
complete this obstacle course

03:26.370 --> 03:28.270
in order to retrieve
your ingredients.

03:28.270 --> 03:29.670
What?

03:29.670 --> 03:33.010
You'll then make your smoothies
in these bicycle powered blenders.

03:33.010 --> 03:34.110
- [laughing]
- Yes.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.940
- Okay, okay, we can do this.
- All right.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.210
You'll have three minutes,

03:37.210 --> 03:41.280
whoever's smoothie is
most like the original wins.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.650
Hilda and Angie, Deneise
and Melody, you're up first.

03:45.650 --> 03:47.490
- [all cheering and clapping]
- You got this.

03:47.490 --> 03:50.590
I love Ms. Deneise.
She's like my grandmother.

03:52.130 --> 03:53.230
Say what?

03:54.460 --> 03:57.970
And obstacle course,
running cycling. [scoffs]

03:57.970 --> 03:59.900
It's just a typical day for me.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.000
You're going down, mama.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.540
All right, recruits.
Ready? Set? Taste.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.410
You can taste the smoothness
of the bananas.

04:09.410 --> 04:11.110
[all cheering]

04:11.110 --> 04:13.210
You know...
they bring that creamy...

04:13.980 --> 04:14.650
you can taste it.

04:14.650 --> 04:16.520
- Oh.
- Oh!

04:16.520 --> 04:20.390
I was hopping over that table like there's
no tomorrow, going through those tires like

04:21.090 --> 04:22.220
jelly.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.270
Whoo! Girl, watch your step!

04:32.830 --> 04:35.770
Hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.

04:35.770 --> 04:39.070
<i>[Deneise] I'm in a perfect shape
to get through this challenge.</i>

04:39.070 --> 04:41.280
- You don't think I can run?
- You can't beat me running.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.810
- Oh, please.
- [cheering]

04:42.810 --> 04:45.750
- Come on, Deneise!
- Liquid, we need the liquid.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.520
Almond milk.
Almond milk, urgh!

04:48.520 --> 04:51.080
<i>[Hilda] It could be
coconut or almond,</i>

04:51.090 --> 04:52.390
so I picked coconut.

04:52.390 --> 04:54.220
- Are we ready to make this?
- I don't know. What have we got?

04:54.220 --> 04:55.460
- Okay, okay.
- We should start doing it now.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.160
[Anne]
Get it in your blender.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.960
I'd start blending
if you're ready.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.030
Put the peanut butter in there.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.560
I did, I already put
the peanut butter in there.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.430
<i>[Deneise] Someone's gotta ride
that exercise machine.</i>

05:04.630 --> 05:06.070
Melody.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.400
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Get it all in there. Come on, Deneise.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.300
[yelling]

05:10.410 --> 05:12.640
No, don't turn it on,
I was getting on there.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.040
I look across the room
and... Hilda is on her bike.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.980
But guess what? There's
nothing in that blender.

05:25.050 --> 05:26.790
That's about right.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.460
It was there in spirit.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.990
[Deneise] Work it, girl,
work it!

05:30.990 --> 05:32.260
Ooh! I'm tired.

05:32.260 --> 05:35.600
Oh, my gosh, she was exhausted
in two... less than a minute.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.100
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.400
Deneise, pour it in!

05:38.400 --> 05:40.370
- [all cheering]
- Pour it!

05:40.370 --> 05:41.300
It's not thick enough.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.440
- Come on.
- No!

05:42.440 --> 05:44.040
[Anne] All right, time's up.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.170
All right, Red Team,
what is in your smoothie?

05:47.180 --> 05:50.310
Banana, strawberry, spinach,
peanut butter, blueberries.

05:50.310 --> 05:51.480
And coconut milk.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.950
This tastes fine.

05:52.950 --> 05:57.180
-So, we have spinach, -[both]
Almond milk, banana and strawberry.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.250
- [Deneise] And, uh, peanut butter.
- [Cliff] The original smoothie

05:59.250 --> 06:01.150
had strawberries,

06:01.160 --> 06:04.290
almond milk, peanut butter
and banana.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.960
Blue Team,
this round goes to you.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.900
[all cheering]

06:08.900 --> 06:11.200
[Anne] That's all right,
ladies. You did a good job.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.470
Hilda! Damn coconut milk.
[grunts]

06:14.470 --> 06:16.940
Blue, blue, blue...

06:16.940 --> 06:18.210
Didn't I tell you?

06:19.640 --> 06:22.580
It's time to play
the Three Egged Race.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.010
Pairs must work together

06:25.010 --> 06:28.150
to separate as my eggs
as possible in three minutes.

06:28.150 --> 06:29.350
You must collect the eggs

06:29.350 --> 06:32.220
on the opposite side
of boot camp

06:32.220 --> 06:35.290
and navigate through an obstacle
course while balancing them

06:35.290 --> 06:36.390
on your helmet.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.060
To make things more egg-citing,

06:40.060 --> 06:42.630
you will be tied together
with your teammates.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.830
[laughing]

06:44.830 --> 06:48.340
The team that separates the most
eggs at the end of three minutes wins.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.340
- Hector and Marti.
- [cheering]

06:50.340 --> 06:52.710
Cheyenne and Peachez.

06:52.710 --> 06:54.040
It's over for y'all.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.680
- Let's put on your helmets and your sweatshirts.
- [laughing]

06:56.680 --> 07:02.020
We have become an amalgamation
of the greatest egg separators

07:02.020 --> 07:03.850
the world has ever seen.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.490
<i>Peachyanne.</i>

07:05.490 --> 07:10.290
The unstoppable drag
egg separating duo!

07:11.330 --> 07:15.030
[laughing maniacally]

07:15.130 --> 07:17.330
[laughing]

07:17.330 --> 07:18.770
That was a quick haircut, Marti.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.430
Well, you know,
just fashion-forward.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.070
Have you ever seen a gladiator
look this fierce? Ooh!

07:23.070 --> 07:24.810
I look fab...
fabulous right now.

07:24.810 --> 07:26.240
By the end of the show,
Hector's gonna be

07:26.240 --> 07:27.510
- a fierce drag queen.
- Hmm. [clicks]

07:28.340 --> 07:30.240
Time starts now.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.650
Let's go. Yo! We got this!

07:32.650 --> 07:33.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:33.850 --> 07:37.120
We're hopping through
those tires, boop-boop-boop.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.750
Grabbing those eggs.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.860
Dip it! Dip it! Dip it! It's
okay, let's go, let's go, let's go!

07:41.860 --> 07:44.320
Come on, Hector, let's go!
Lift those knees.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.930
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- All right!

07:46.930 --> 07:49.360
Cheyenne and I are
in perfect stride.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.670
<i>We are focused, we are winning.</i>

07:51.670 --> 07:54.500
And what do we see
out of the corner of our eye?

07:54.500 --> 07:57.440
Hold my hand. We got this...
No!

07:57.440 --> 07:59.470
No! No!

07:59.480 --> 08:01.940
There's my mother dropping eggs.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.410
[Peachez yells]

08:07.420 --> 08:10.750
Eggs are flying
all over the place.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.290
It's on my feet!
Get it! Get it! Get it!

08:13.290 --> 08:16.860
But I'm not cracked.
Let's go. We have to win!

08:16.860 --> 08:18.290
[Anne] You gotta separate
the eggs though.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.960
Let's go, Hector!

08:19.960 --> 08:23.800
We are neck and neck. Literally,
every egg makes a difference.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.970
In the hat, in the-- Oh, I'm down! I'm
down! I'm down! I'm down! I'm down!

08:26.970 --> 08:29.470
- I'm up! I'm up! I'm up!
- Beautiful yolks.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.300
Beautiful yolks!

08:31.970 --> 08:34.570
Three, two, one!

08:35.310 --> 08:36.610
That felt good!

08:37.380 --> 08:39.380
Ew! Salmonella everywhere!

08:39.380 --> 08:41.380
All right,
we're gonna check your eggs.

08:41.380 --> 08:42.850
- [chuckles]
- It's a little messy.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.250
- [chuckling]
- [Cliff] Okay.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.920
- Oh, no, how many?
- How many yolks is it? How many yolks is it?

08:45.920 --> 08:48.420
- I see one, I see two.
- One yolk, two yolk, three yolk, four...

08:48.420 --> 08:50.220
five yolks, seven more...

08:50.230 --> 08:52.090
- Get some yolk.
- You missed six, girl!

08:52.090 --> 08:53.690
[laughs]

08:53.700 --> 08:56.830
The Blue Team has more
whole egg yolks in there,

08:56.830 --> 08:59.930
but I don't really see
so much separation.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.400
It looks like it's a tie.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.510
[Cliff] All right, we're gonna
check your eggs.

09:11.510 --> 09:14.050
Feel like the Red Team
has more yolks

09:14.050 --> 09:15.520
and less whites.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.390
It looks like it's a tie. They're
talking, they're deliberating.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.550
I'm gonna have to contest this.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.290
I think this point goes to
the Blue Team.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.090
No! Fraudulence.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.420
This is gonna be a tie!

09:24.430 --> 09:26.530
We're gonna be gracious.
We'll give it to the Blue.

09:26.530 --> 09:29.430
But it's not! 'Cause I win!

09:29.430 --> 09:32.270
Aye! I won! I won!

09:32.270 --> 09:35.240
- [yelling]
- What?

09:35.240 --> 09:37.470
- Take that, mama!
- You're out of the house.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.480
Oh, I'm just kidding. I would
never do that. I love you.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.810
- [laughing]
- That escalated quickly.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.820
[laughing]

09:48.820 --> 09:50.780
- That you so much!
- Thank you.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.220
We did it! [chuckles]

09:53.220 --> 09:56.360
Our third event
is no small potato.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.220
It's called Spud Run.

09:58.230 --> 10:02.400
Recruits must peel as many
potatoes as they can in three minutes.

10:02.400 --> 10:07.200
But first, recruits must transport the
potatoes from one end of the arena

10:07.200 --> 10:08.170
to the other

10:08.170 --> 10:11.370
using only their bodies.

10:11.370 --> 10:13.110
- [laughing]
- Oh, nice!

10:13.110 --> 10:14.740
[all laughing]

10:14.740 --> 10:15.880
How do you do that?

10:15.880 --> 10:18.850
- Kara and Angie, Melody and Bianca.
- Oh, my God!

10:18.850 --> 10:21.280
- What?
<i>- [Melody] Bianca and I are two busty ladies.</i>

10:21.280 --> 10:23.950
We're gonna make
the perfect potato basket.

10:25.150 --> 10:27.650
All right, recruits.
On your mark, get set, go.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.860
- Yes! [yelling]
- [all cheering]

10:29.860 --> 10:31.190
- All right, get together.
- Go! Go! Go!

10:31.190 --> 10:33.660
<i>[Kara] I'm pulling Angie
so close to me</i>

10:33.660 --> 10:36.000
that I can't tell what's me
and what's Angie.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.100
I never thought I would be
this close to Kara, this early.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.440
Our strategy is to
quickly grab the potatoes,

10:42.440 --> 10:45.340
and carry them back squished
between our lady parts.

10:50.410 --> 10:52.410
- Whoo! [bleeping]
- Where is it?

10:52.410 --> 10:54.580
Our strategy's
definitely working.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.180
[Peachez]
You got this, Melody!

10:57.190 --> 11:00.250
- Let's go, Bianca!
- Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

11:00.260 --> 11:03.590
R-E-D,
that's the winning team to be!

11:03.590 --> 11:05.390
- B-L-U-E...
- R-E-D...

11:07.900 --> 11:10.830
- Don't talk over each other.
- No, I was still cheering, [bleep].

11:10.830 --> 11:14.430
- [yelling]
- That's it, we're stopping?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.040
<i>[Cliff] How many potatoes
does the Red Team have?</i>

11:16.040 --> 11:17.800
Do we have enough
potatoes here to beat them?

11:17.810 --> 11:19.270
Are you sure?

11:19.270 --> 11:20.910
- Here you go! Here you go!
- [panting]

11:20.910 --> 11:24.440
I don't want to trust you, but I
have to. This is me letting go.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.280
Yeah! Go, go, go, go go!
Go, go, go, go go!

11:28.280 --> 11:29.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

11:29.750 --> 11:32.890
At this point I had peeled
like part of my nail off.

11:32.890 --> 11:36.660
If I lose a finger, it's all worth it,
because we need to win this challenge.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.130
You guys are doing great.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.460
[Anne] All right, 15 seconds.

11:40.460 --> 11:41.630
[Cliff] You got it. Focus.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.930
Five, four,

11:43.930 --> 11:47.100
- Three, two, one.
- [Anne] Three, two, one. That's it.

11:47.670 --> 11:48.600
Whoo!

11:52.310 --> 11:54.310
- We have eight.
- We have seven potatoes.

11:54.310 --> 11:58.040
[cheering]

11:58.050 --> 11:59.580
<i>[Melody] We lost
that one potato.</i>

12:00.080 --> 12:03.120
I'm so crushed.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.150
I would like to award you
your first medal, there you go!

12:07.160 --> 12:08.290
Potato Queen.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.420
[laughs mischievously]

12:12.030 --> 12:13.090
For this next event,

12:13.100 --> 12:14.590
<i>the Stunt Doubles,</i>

12:14.600 --> 12:18.770
each team will be given
a beautifully-plated dish.

12:18.770 --> 12:22.440
You must work together as a
team to recreate the composed dish.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.640
But only one recruit
will be able to see the dish.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.840
Only one recruit will be
able to use their hands.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.480
Marti and Hilda,

12:31.480 --> 12:34.310
and Eddie and Peachez,
come on up.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.450
Come on, Eddie, let's do this.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.890
- Oh, okay, come on, Coach Hilda.
- I got it.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.850
Red Team is down two to one.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.590
This is clearly the job
for a coach and a queen.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.960
[narrator] A Coach and a Queen.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.190
<i>Coming soon to Food Network.</i>

12:49.200 --> 12:51.000
Excuse me, hold my medal.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.270
Girl, please.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.070
Recruits,
get those blindfolds on.

12:54.070 --> 12:56.040
Can it go over that girl hair?

12:56.040 --> 12:57.070
You've never looked better.

12:57.070 --> 13:00.410
On your marks, get set...
Plate!

13:00.410 --> 13:02.580
Rice first, there we go. Yup.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.180
Rice, dump the rice,
dump the rice.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.180
- [Peachez] Right there. Pack it in there. Yeah.
- [Eddie] A lot? All of it?

13:06.180 --> 13:07.710
[Peachez] Grab the tuna
to your left.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.280
- Other way... you're in the bowl.
- [Eddie] Am I in the bowl?

13:09.280 --> 13:11.920
Yeah. Now lay it in the lime
right there, baby.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.850
I don't know what I'm doing.
But we got this.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.160
Right.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.290
- My right or your right?
- Your... my right, my right, my right.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.990
- This is the right?
- Right, the meat.

13:18.990 --> 13:21.530
Cucumbers, cucumbers,
cucumbers, radishes, radishes,

13:21.530 --> 13:23.060
drop, drop, find those radishes.

13:23.060 --> 13:26.400
Girl, I cannot see them!

13:26.400 --> 13:27.970
The black bean, pick 'em up.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.570
Where are they?

13:29.570 --> 13:30.440
- Peas, peas...
- All right.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.110
- Peas, peas, peas...
- [both] Five...

13:32.110 --> 13:35.440
- [all] Four, three, two...
- peas, peas, peas...

13:35.440 --> 13:37.940
[Cliff] One. That's it!

13:39.050 --> 13:42.320
Our bowl is looking like
that cat's meow.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.820
Girl, we got this.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.950
- That is terrible.
- No, it's got close, it's close.

13:49.890 --> 13:53.090
I think the Red Team's bowl
looks a little bit more complete.

13:53.090 --> 13:54.490
This is a fantastic job

13:55.060 --> 13:57.300
by both sides, but...

13:57.300 --> 13:58.870
we gotta give it to the
Red Team. [chuckles]

13:58.870 --> 14:00.530
[cheering]

14:00.540 --> 14:01.670
- [Marti] Yes!
- This is...

14:01.670 --> 14:03.800
[screams] We did it!

14:03.810 --> 14:04.640
[cheering]

14:04.640 --> 14:06.110
We know the truth in our hearts.

14:06.110 --> 14:09.140
Get your medal. Here we go.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.310
[Anne] After round number four,

14:12.310 --> 14:14.980
we are all tied up.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.490
For our final round,

14:19.490 --> 14:23.890
Snapped. One recruit
must taste and identify

14:23.890 --> 14:25.830
all the ingredients in a dish.

14:25.830 --> 14:29.360
They will then describe
the dish to their partners.

14:29.360 --> 14:33.630
The partners must then grab and
place the correct ingredient cubes

14:33.640 --> 14:35.000
in the basket.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.110
[Anne] However the recruits,
grabbing the ingredient cubes

14:39.110 --> 14:41.410
will be connected
to a bungee cord.

14:41.410 --> 14:43.010
Yes.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.310
[all laughing]

14:44.310 --> 14:48.380
The team that collects the
most correct ingredients will win.

14:48.380 --> 14:50.480
- Kara and Al...
- [Kara] Yes.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.150
Bianca and Eddie,

14:52.150 --> 14:53.290
come on up.

14:53.290 --> 14:55.390
<i>[Eddie] I'm a bit worried
about Bianca right now</i>

14:55.390 --> 14:57.920
<i>because my wife takes
competition very seriously</i>

14:57.930 --> 15:00.460
and she's not gonna be
safe in there with her.

15:04.930 --> 15:06.670
On you mark, get set, taste.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.000
Bell pepper,
there's bell pepper.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.340
[Anne] Come on girls!
Come on! Oh, yay!

15:10.340 --> 15:12.470
- [Cliff] Go...
- [Anne] Come on, Kara, come on, Kara.

15:12.470 --> 15:15.210
[Cliff] ...careful!
Spread it out! Spread it out!

15:15.210 --> 15:16.540
Pepper. Grab a pepper.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.510
We got them!

15:19.510 --> 15:21.610
Get up. There you go. Pepper.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.450
Pepper, yeah!

15:24.450 --> 15:26.420
Kara is going bananas.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.620
Rice, rice.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.460
She's already got things
in the basket.

15:30.460 --> 15:33.190
Now I look over, we're just
trying to get something in there.

15:33.190 --> 15:36.030
Ground turkey. Ground turkey.

15:36.030 --> 15:39.200
I did not expect this at all.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.340
<i>It started out as this
friendly little tug of war.</i>

15:42.340 --> 15:43.840
[Anne] Pull, pull, Kara.

15:43.840 --> 15:47.440
Then all of a sudden
it turned into a melee.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.240
-All right, there we
go. [screams] -Oh!

15:52.380 --> 15:54.080
[laughs heartily]

15:54.080 --> 15:55.420
- [Cliff] Booyah!
- Aw!

15:55.420 --> 15:57.250
- [Cliff] Pull it out.
<i>- [Kara] I turn around</i>

15:57.250 --> 15:59.220
I see that they
still only have one

15:59.220 --> 16:02.390
<i>and there are 30 seconds
left on the clock.</i>

16:05.930 --> 16:09.460
Wait, wait. I think Kara just hurt
herself. She is completely down,

16:09.460 --> 16:11.060
she's on the ground.

16:11.070 --> 16:14.370
[Anne] All right, come
on, Kara, come on! Get up!

16:14.370 --> 16:16.170
I'm so lost and confused.

16:16.170 --> 16:17.640
Are you hurt?
Are you gonna beat her up?

16:17.640 --> 16:19.140
What is going on?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.950
[Anne] Come on, Kara! Come on!

16:26.950 --> 16:29.450
Wait, wait, I think Kara
actually just hurt herself.

16:29.450 --> 16:31.750
She's completely down,
she's on the ground.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.020
[Anne] Get up.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.520
Then, as it turns out
we all realized.

16:37.490 --> 16:38.560
Is that allowed?

16:39.290 --> 16:40.530
Okay, what's next?

16:40.530 --> 16:41.930
Subterfuge.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.200
Sabotage!

16:45.200 --> 16:46.930
<i>[Cliff] Kara is completely fine.</i>

16:46.940 --> 16:49.940
She was just letting
the clock run. I say,

16:49.940 --> 16:52.010
"Holy Sugar."

16:52.940 --> 16:54.270
<i>She tricked me.</i>

16:54.280 --> 16:59.610
[Anne] Five, four, three,
two, one, that's it.

17:00.380 --> 17:01.880
Wow, you girls!

17:01.880 --> 17:04.180
So, Blue Team,
the cilantro is correct.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.850
The bell pepper is correct.
The ground beef is not.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.420
Red Team, we have black beans
which are correct.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.730
We have rice that's correct.

17:12.730 --> 17:15.090
We have bell pepper
that is correct.

17:15.100 --> 17:18.060
We have ground turkey
which is incorrect.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.470
- Ground pork.
- So...

17:19.470 --> 17:22.170
It looks like
we have three points!

17:22.170 --> 17:25.770
- [all cheering]
- Yay!

17:25.770 --> 17:26.970
This would be medal number three

17:26.980 --> 17:28.910
- for the Red Team.
- [Red Team cheering]

17:28.910 --> 17:31.140
- There you go, Kara. Very nice.
- Thank you.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.010
[Cliff] Great job. Great job.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.080
- [Melody] Yes.
- Great job.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.080
- So good.
- Good job.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.280
Red Team,
you may have won the battle,

17:37.290 --> 17:38.580
but you will not win the war.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.290
Good job.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.360
<i>Viva the Blue revolution.</i>

17:43.890 --> 17:46.660
Rocking Red stars, because
you guys have proven

17:46.660 --> 17:50.300
that you are true
American Culinary warriors,

17:50.300 --> 17:55.440
you will receive a 2-minute head
start on today's Skill Drill Cook.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.170
- [cheering]
- Yeah.

17:58.170 --> 18:01.470
- [Marti] Two minutes.
- Win with class.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.410
So, now that you guys have
flexed your culinary muscles,

18:05.410 --> 18:08.380
now it's time to make a meal
fit for a culinary titan.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.250
So, recruits, sharpen your
blades, put on your game faces,

18:11.250 --> 18:13.290
and step into our arena.

18:13.290 --> 18:18.390
For today, Cliff and I are going
to be making a falafel platter

18:18.390 --> 18:20.730
<i>with tabouli and tahini sauce.</i>

18:20.730 --> 18:22.730
- Ooh!
- Nice.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.900
I haven't even heard of a
falafel. I don't know what it is.

18:25.900 --> 18:29.200
It's a cool word. It rhymes with
waffle. That's it. That's all I know.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.070
[Anne] I'm gonna take
two teaspoons of cumin seed

18:32.070 --> 18:34.910
right into a dry saute pan,

18:34.910 --> 18:37.840
and I'm gonna toast
for just a couple of minutes.

18:37.850 --> 18:41.050
They'll get a little bit
darker and really aromatic.

18:41.050 --> 18:43.180
And then we have
our spice grinder

18:43.180 --> 18:44.880
and we just wanna get this done.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.220
And then we're gonna
start to build our falafel.

18:47.220 --> 18:51.460
We're gonna start off with
one pound of soaked chickpeas,

18:51.460 --> 18:54.330
half an onion,
two cloves of garlic,

18:54.330 --> 18:57.030
parsley, cilantro, cumin,

18:57.030 --> 18:59.370
chickpea flour, baking soda.

18:59.370 --> 19:03.270
Pulse it, till it
starts to come together

19:03.270 --> 19:05.770
into a bowl and then
we're gonna let it hang out.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.110
Now, we're going to create
some of the supporting cast.

19:08.110 --> 19:10.640
We're going to start with
the tabouli salad.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.180
Bulgur wheat, olive oil. We're
just gonna coat the wheat

19:13.180 --> 19:14.050
and add boiling water to it.

19:14.050 --> 19:15.550
Little quick mix.

19:15.550 --> 19:17.950
Now we're gonna cover it to
steam for about 15-20 minutes.

19:17.950 --> 19:22.090
And what's gonna happen is
the bulgur wheat will hydrate.

19:22.090 --> 19:25.360
While that is chilling out over there,
we're gonna make the vinaigrette.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.090
One clove of minced garlic,
one lemon,

19:28.100 --> 19:32.100
zest and the juice as well.
Olive oil.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.900
We're gonna prep our vegetables.
We're gonna cut the cucumber in half.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.340
Then you're gonna
cut it into quarters.

19:36.340 --> 19:39.440
Take the seeds out. Then we're
gonna cut the quarters in half,

19:39.440 --> 19:41.470
creating even pieces.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.240
Tomato, then we cut it
the same size. Red onion.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.010
Scallion, parsley and mint.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.080
Uniformity,
that's what we're looking for.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.120
Chef Anne, you always sing
that song. What's that song?

19:53.120 --> 19:55.790
I've been watching
<i>Worst Cooks in America</i>

19:55.790 --> 19:58.120

season one.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.630
- What song is that?
- When you're cutting stuff the same...

20:00.630 --> 20:01.490
There's a song?

20:09.340 --> 20:11.070

think about it.

Yes, oh, my gosh, yes.

20:13.270 --> 20:15.580
[Anne]
<i>♪ Slices, Sticks, Dices ♪</i>

20:17.680 --> 20:20.250
[Cliff] We're gonna take our
bulgur wheat, strain out that liquid,

20:20.250 --> 20:23.120
and then I'm gonna gently
push out more of that moisture.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.150
Spread it out. I'm gonna let it cool
before we continue to build our salad.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.190
[Anne] Bouncing back to
my falafel mix...

20:29.320 --> 20:31.090
We're gonna start
scooping some balls.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.290
Aah!

20:33.290 --> 20:35.760
Roll them around to get
them to a nice tight ball.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.130
Give 'em a little bit of
a squish into patties.

20:38.130 --> 20:40.730
Dust them in chickpea flour.
We're just gonna let them fry

20:40.740 --> 20:42.100
till they are nice
and golden brown.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.070
Pull them out, little sprinkle of
salt, and then falafel are done.

20:45.070 --> 20:48.340
Really quick tahini sauce.
Quarter cup of tahini,

20:48.340 --> 20:50.310
yoghurt, pomegranate, molasses.

20:50.310 --> 20:51.910
The juice of
a quarter of a lemon.

20:51.910 --> 20:53.550
And then we're gonna
whisk everything together.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.450
All the ingredients
that we had for

20:55.450 --> 20:58.280
our tabouli salad in the
bowl. Bulgur wheat, cucumber,

20:58.290 --> 21:00.090
tomato, scallion,
parsley and mint.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.320
Lemon vinaigrette, everybody in.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.860
Gonna put my falafel
right on top of that lettuce.

21:04.860 --> 21:07.230
There you go. Do you want
to tabouli and I'll cut pita?

21:08.930 --> 21:11.230
Pitas that are cut in triangles.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.130
There you go. Sauce me.

21:13.830 --> 21:14.930

45 minutes

21:27.850 --> 21:32.050

28:21.200 --> 28:23.700
I don't think I rolled those
tight enough.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.900
<i>[Cheyenne] I look over in the
fryer to check on my falafels,</i>

28:25.900 --> 28:28.630
and they're disintegrated!
They're just gone!

28:28.640 --> 28:32.470
How does this happen? I
mean, there is nothing in this fryer.

28:33.970 --> 28:36.940
<i>[narrator] You have now
entered the Worst Cooks Zone.</i>

28:36.940 --> 28:39.080
[thunderclap]

28:39.450 --> 28:40.580
[grunts]

28:43.150 --> 28:45.180
Deneise, did you
take my falafels?

28:45.190 --> 28:47.090
Where the frick...
Peachez?

28:47.090 --> 28:50.760
What do I look like? Houdini?
I can't help you, girl.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.060
Chef Cliff, my chickpea
patties fell apart. What do I do?

28:54.060 --> 28:57.060
Um, okay, pull out
all the little, tiny pieces.

28:57.060 --> 28:58.930
It-- it's gone.
It's disintegrated.

28:58.930 --> 29:02.100
- Wait all of it?
- All of it? It just disintegrated.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.470
I was feeling so good
about my dish.

29:04.470 --> 29:07.770
And now, what am I going to
serve the chefs?

29:07.780 --> 29:10.680
Okay, all right,
we're starting over.

29:17.420 --> 29:20.750
Chef Cliff, my chickpea
patties fell apart. What do I do?

29:20.760 --> 29:22.050
- Wait...
- Just pull it all out?

29:22.060 --> 29:25.060
- Wait all of it?
- All of it. It just disintegrated.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.290
Are you sure you made them?

29:26.890 --> 29:28.390
Yes, I'm sure.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.660
<i>- I think aliens abducted those fritters.
- [Angie] Yeah, I think so.</i>

29:30.660 --> 29:33.070
- We're gonna go with whatever you got. Okay?
- Okay.

29:33.070 --> 29:36.000
There's no crying
over broken falafel.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.700
Oh, my God.
It's gonna fall apart.

29:37.710 --> 29:39.970
Oh, and I need to have
six of them. Oh...

29:39.970 --> 29:42.880
- Dang it.
- [Cliff] Blue Team, you have five minutes.

29:42.880 --> 29:45.380
You need to do whatever
you can to finish in five minutes.

29:45.380 --> 29:47.150
Yes, chef!

29:47.150 --> 29:49.310
[Eddie] We're just gonna
make something happen.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.950
Now, I'm getting confused,
what's a falafel?

29:51.950 --> 29:54.420
<i>What's a tabouli?
What's a tahini?</i>

29:54.420 --> 29:57.090
Awful falafel.

29:57.090 --> 29:58.990
That's a little better,
that's a little better.

29:58.990 --> 30:00.690
No it's not. It's not better.

30:00.690 --> 30:02.230
I'm not gonna get
anything cooked.

30:02.230 --> 30:06.130
I'm just gonna plate what I've
got as pretty as I can plate it.

30:06.130 --> 30:08.530
<i>And I'm just gonna be
tickled with it.</i>

30:09.470 --> 30:11.440
[Melody] Oh, my oil
isn't hot enough.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.870
Oh, my God!

30:12.870 --> 30:13.970
Melody, listen to
the sound of my voice.

30:13.970 --> 30:15.070
- Dump everything in the bowl.
- Okay.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.980
Dump everything in the bowl.
There's one.

30:16.980 --> 30:19.480
All your vegetables.
Bang, bang, bang. Yes!

30:19.480 --> 30:21.380
I may not be able
to fry that falafel,

30:21.380 --> 30:24.020
<i>but I can at least
get my salad together.</i>

30:25.650 --> 30:27.350
What are you doing with that?

30:27.350 --> 30:28.320
Oh, my goodness.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.450
I messed up.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.690
I was supposed to mix the
salad with the vinaigrette

30:32.690 --> 30:35.960
<i>and the sauce was
supposed to be separate.</i>

30:35.960 --> 30:38.300
But, I mixed it all together.

30:38.300 --> 30:40.170
Big mistake.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.940
- [Cliff screaming] One minute! One minute!
- Aah! Aah!

30:49.410 --> 30:52.080
No, it's not hot enough.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.050
You could've at least
put it into oil.

30:54.050 --> 30:55.780
<i>Something would've happened.</i>

30:55.780 --> 30:57.380
I put it in. They drowned.

30:57.380 --> 30:59.120
They went,
"Boop, boop, boop."

31:01.090 --> 31:05.190
[Anne and Cliff] Five, four,
three, two, one.

31:05.190 --> 31:07.330
That's it, hands up.
You're done.

31:07.330 --> 31:10.000
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

31:10.000 --> 31:12.360
- Whoo!
- Mine's low-carb.

31:12.370 --> 31:16.030
All right. Well, you wanna try
some falafel. Not all.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.670
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:17.670 --> 31:20.110
- [Cliff] Bianca, you're up first.
- I hope it tastes good.

31:20.110 --> 31:23.940
The visual of the tabouli
salad, it's very, very inviting.

31:23.940 --> 31:26.750
[Anne] Your falafel, really
nice and crispy on the outside,

31:26.750 --> 31:29.110
- and they taste really good. All right?
- Thank you, Chef.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.220
Do need a little bit of sauce. But the
main character in the movie is fantastic.

31:32.220 --> 31:33.690
Yay!

31:33.690 --> 31:35.420
It's a B movie because it's
missing some supporting cast.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.490
- Hector, come on up.
- Be gentle.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.460
We're missing a few parts here.

31:42.460 --> 31:45.330
I think if you
had gotten the falafel fried,

31:45.330 --> 31:46.770
they would've been pretty good.

31:46.770 --> 31:50.240
You were moving
with a slow purpose.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.940
- You just need a little bit more urgency.
- Okay.

31:52.940 --> 31:55.740
In my defense, there was a lot
of running in the first challenge.

31:55.740 --> 31:58.710
[all screaming]

31:58.710 --> 32:02.380
I was probably, you know,
feeling, uh... the effects of that.

32:02.380 --> 32:05.180
You know, just, pointing it
out there. Putting it out there.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.050
- Melody.
<i>- It's not complete,</i>

32:07.050 --> 32:08.650
but it's all about
how you sell it.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.620
I'm not feeling
too hungry today.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.930
That falafel is delicious
in spirit.

32:12.930 --> 32:16.260
So much positive energy
into this plate.

32:16.260 --> 32:18.400
You sauces were made,
your vegetables were ready.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.370
- The falafel...
- [Melody] The grease was not hot.

32:20.370 --> 32:21.800
So, I couldn't even take it out.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.040
That's when things
kinda got a little janky.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.270
But the seasoning of the
vinaigrette was very good.

32:26.270 --> 32:27.410
Thanks.

32:27.410 --> 32:30.080
If you send positive energy
out into the universe,

32:30.080 --> 32:32.040
you get positive energy back.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.410
Hilda, come on up.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.310
- Chefs.
- [Cliff] Hello.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.880
Hmm, where's all the stuff
in your tabouli?

32:37.890 --> 32:40.250
It got mixed all up
with the sauce

32:40.250 --> 32:41.750
by accident.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.390
It's like somebody destroyed
a sand castle on the beach.

32:43.390 --> 32:44.990
- [Anne] Looking for buried treasure.
- Yeah.

32:44.990 --> 32:47.960
Your falafel feel a little bit
on the dry side to me.

32:48.330 --> 32:49.330
Ooh!

32:49.330 --> 32:50.760
But it's a complete plate.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.130
Okay, thank you.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.330
- Deneise, show us your platter.
- Yes.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.100
I'll show you a lot more, Chef.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.500
I didn't catch anything on fire.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.310
Yay! But it's
deconstructed tabouli.

33:02.310 --> 33:05.080
- [laughs] Yeah.
- You missed the step of marrying these two.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.010
My dish is
choose-your-own-adventure.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.350
<i>It's for you to mix
how you'd like.</i>

33:10.350 --> 33:13.990
Eating this into this
is actually quite good.

33:13.990 --> 33:16.990
For the main dish challenge
I wanna see you be double-D.

33:16.990 --> 33:19.460
- [mouthing]
- Deneise the Destroyer.

33:19.460 --> 33:20.930
[Marti] Yay!

33:20.930 --> 33:21.930
[chuckling]

33:21.930 --> 33:23.130
[Anne] Angie, come on up.

33:23.130 --> 33:24.630
Nice-looking plate of food.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.670
Um, how much cumin did you use?

33:29.670 --> 33:32.470
Did you measure two teaspoons
or two tablespoons?

33:32.770 --> 33:34.210
Um...

33:34.210 --> 33:36.680
- I don't think I ever measured it, to be honest.
- Wait, what?

33:36.680 --> 33:39.080
- Oh, good.
- I couldn't find my spoon, so I just...

33:39.080 --> 33:43.680
- Sorry.
- Your falafel taste good. They're just very cumin heavy.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.050
Shocking.

33:45.050 --> 33:49.350
- [Cliff] Cheyenne.
- I was really scrambling, the pita ripped and...

33:49.360 --> 33:52.420
- here we are.
- But let's not cry over ripped pita.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.290
[chuckles softly]

33:53.290 --> 33:55.660
[crickets chirping]

33:58.160 --> 34:01.370
- It's really hard to over-salt tabouli. And this one is...
- Like...

34:01.370 --> 34:03.340
shockingly over-seasoned.

34:03.340 --> 34:06.100
- Your falafel, it's a big falafel funnel cake.
- Yeah.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.270
- Marti, come on up.
- [Marti] Okay.

34:08.280 --> 34:13.010
- I have my Red Team shoes on for you
today. [chuckles] - [Anne] Right, all right.

34:13.010 --> 34:16.480
Honey, my dish is looking like
if you took Anne and Cliff's

34:16.480 --> 34:18.550
and just put
a couple of filters on it.

34:19.790 --> 34:21.420
Your tabouli tastes really good.

34:21.420 --> 34:24.190
You falafel nice and crunchy
on the outside,

34:24.190 --> 34:25.960
fluffy on the inside.

34:25.960 --> 34:27.990
You did a very, very nice job.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.590
[laughs]

34:30.130 --> 34:32.230
[Anne] All right, Kara.

34:32.230 --> 34:36.130
- Okay.
- The falafel mix, I feel like you missed...

34:36.340 --> 34:38.170
steps in the recipe.

34:38.170 --> 34:41.910
You mean like when I didn't
even get anything cooked.

34:41.910 --> 34:46.280
The knife cuts on you tabouli
look uniform, focused.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.080
We know your husband's
right across the room...

34:48.080 --> 34:50.420
- I know.
- Like, keep you eyes on your own paper.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.280
Yes, Chef.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.350
Chef Anne, have you seen him?
Ha!

34:55.760 --> 34:58.190
[sighs]
It's nearly impossible.

34:58.190 --> 34:59.960
Eddie, show me
your falafel plate.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.530
[whistles]

35:01.860 --> 35:04.360
<i>[Eddie] Looking down at this dish,
it's like I made it with a blindfold on.</i>

35:04.360 --> 35:06.230
[Anne] I'm confused
what this is.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.100
- It's like a pollock.
- Is that good?

35:08.100 --> 35:11.570
I mean, I do have a masters
in teaching K-12 art.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.040
Oh, man, Eddie,
this is not pretty.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.410
I just wanted to
give you something.

35:16.410 --> 35:18.280
Even though, sometimes,

35:18.280 --> 35:19.980
nothing maybe
better than something.

35:19.980 --> 35:23.010
Chef Cliff is not happy.
Embarrassing.

35:29.090 --> 35:31.620
I just wanted to give you
something to eat.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.460
I just brought them a salad
with the ingredients on it.

35:35.460 --> 35:38.430
- Nothing was cooked.
- You had everything on your station to finish it.

35:38.430 --> 35:40.230
And I know
you could've finished it.

35:40.230 --> 35:42.930
- Al, come on up.
- [Kara] Come on, Big Al.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.370
I did get all six falafels on.

35:45.370 --> 35:49.840
And whatever the... uh,
now I can't even say it.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.480
The tagoda.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.180
You got some herbs in you tabouli
but we're missing the vinaigrette.

35:54.180 --> 35:57.720
For the vegetables that you did
add, everything is nice and even.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.350
If you work with
a little bit more urgency,

36:00.350 --> 36:03.220
you won't feel up against
the clock at the end.

36:03.220 --> 36:04.420
Good deal.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.760
- Peachez.
- All right!

36:06.760 --> 36:08.230
Hello, chefs.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.360
I'm ready to be
praised, honestly.

36:11.370 --> 36:14.230
- I'm angry at the tabouli.
- [laughs]

36:14.230 --> 36:16.330
Angry? At my tab...
What does that even mean?

36:16.340 --> 36:17.300
Angry?

36:17.300 --> 36:18.470
[Cliff] You have things,

36:18.470 --> 36:19.370
they're not right things.

36:19.370 --> 36:21.440
Okay.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.310
I'm angry at that comment.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.280
We're gonna work
on being more organized.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.450
But, there are
a lot of good parts here.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.950
Thank you, Chef Anne.

36:29.950 --> 36:31.450
Must be the hair.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.690
- Whoo!
- [all laughing]

36:35.690 --> 36:39.290
Welcome back, recruits, for
today's main dish challenge.

36:39.290 --> 36:41.290
Cliff and I are going to
teach you guys

36:41.300 --> 36:45.160
a dish that is bursting
with flavor and spice.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.200
- Oh...
- Oh!

36:46.200 --> 36:47.370
Chicken adobo.

36:47.370 --> 36:49.530
- Ooh!
- [Deneise] Adobo!

36:49.540 --> 36:52.970
We're also gonna show you how
to break down a whole chicken.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.510
- [gasps]
- Yeah!

36:57.080 --> 36:58.240
- We don't have to pluck it or anything.
- No, no...

36:58.250 --> 36:59.840
- No, no.
- No plucking.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.750
And to kick things up a notch, Anne
and I have one more trick up our sleeves.

37:03.750 --> 37:04.980
[all exclaiming]

37:04.990 --> 37:07.090
Starting this week,
moving forward,

37:07.090 --> 37:11.120
only one recruit
will be eliminated each week.

37:11.120 --> 37:17.030
It will either be a Blue Team or
a Red Team elimination week.

37:17.030 --> 37:19.100
What? A plot twist?

37:19.100 --> 37:22.170
We'll determine which team
is up for elimination first,

37:22.170 --> 37:25.070
based on your performance in
the main dish challenge today.

37:25.070 --> 37:29.510
As an added incentive, the
recruit with the winning dish

37:29.510 --> 37:32.440
on the non-eliminating team

37:32.450 --> 37:35.280
will receive a cash bonus.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.880
- Honey!
- Yeah.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.020
- Okay. Come on...
- [clapping]

37:38.020 --> 37:40.120
Recruits, step in our office.

37:40.120 --> 37:43.290
For this week's challenge, we're gonna
show you how to make chicken adobo,

37:43.290 --> 37:44.460
<i>Filipino fried rice</i>

37:44.460 --> 37:46.020
<i>and charred Japanese eggplant.</i>

37:47.930 --> 37:51.130
Never heard the term
chicken adobo

37:51.130 --> 37:52.900
or abobby or ajobo.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.700
[laughing] I honestly
have no idea what it could be.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.940
This is a Filipino adobo,
and it's seasoned

37:58.940 --> 38:04.340
with a lot of garlic, black
pepper, vinegar and soya sauce.

38:04.340 --> 38:09.480
We're gonna start off by
breaking down a whole chicken.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.650
I take the legs sliced
down to the joint,

38:12.650 --> 38:14.420
take our fingers underneath...

38:14.420 --> 38:15.250
[popping]

38:15.260 --> 38:17.090
- [gasps]
- We pop it.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.990
- We hear that little bone crushing...
- [Kara] Oh, my God.

38:18.990 --> 38:21.090
Ooh! Mmm-mmm.

38:21.090 --> 38:24.860
Keeping my knife right along
the bone, we just take it off.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.970
When we get to the wing,
cut it off,

38:26.970 --> 38:28.570
sort of in the elbow.
And then we're gonna...

38:28.570 --> 38:30.000
- [pops]
- pop it open.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.270
[retching]

38:31.270 --> 38:34.370
So now, take the breast,
pull the skin taut,

38:34.370 --> 38:38.140
cut all the way down
and then the breast comes off.

38:38.150 --> 38:42.180
We're gonna use the legs and the
thighs today. Cut these guys right apart.

38:42.180 --> 38:45.020
Canola oil. Pat that skin dry.

38:45.020 --> 38:51.290
A nice sprinkle of salt.
In our pan, skin-side down.

38:51.290 --> 38:54.730
You really want to take your time
and get your chicken nice and brown.

38:54.730 --> 38:56.330
Brown food tastes good.

38:56.330 --> 38:58.900
We're gonna start with a
pickle that will be the dressing

38:58.900 --> 39:00.230
for our eggplant side.

39:00.230 --> 39:02.870
White vinegar, sugar.
One bay leaf.

39:02.870 --> 39:05.770
While that is going,
we're looking to char

39:05.770 --> 39:07.670
this beautiful
Japanese eggplant.

39:07.670 --> 39:10.080
Cut it in half
so it's even, score it,

39:10.080 --> 39:13.280
oil the eggplant liberally.
The grill pan must be hot.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.010
[Anne] Good, nice and browned
all over the place.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.220
Gonna set that aside
for just a second.

39:18.220 --> 39:21.290
Little bit of new oil,
one onion. I'm gonna add

39:21.290 --> 39:24.290
my garlic, vinegar
and soya sauce.

39:24.290 --> 39:28.190
Palm sugar is sweet. It kinda
tastes a lot like brown sugar.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.260
I'm gonna add in my bay leaves
and my pepper.

39:31.260 --> 39:34.970
Stir this around until that
palm sugar has all dissolved,

39:34.970 --> 39:37.100
add our chicken back to our pan,

39:37.100 --> 39:39.200
cook it with a lid on.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.170
[Cliff] Dice our tomato,
half an onion,

39:41.170 --> 39:43.640
cut the eggplant right
on the bias just like that.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.440
Everybody into the party.

39:45.450 --> 39:47.450
Your pickle with the bay leaf.

39:47.450 --> 39:49.150
Everyone in the pool.

39:49.150 --> 39:50.850
Taking my chicken out.

39:50.850 --> 39:56.020
You wanna make sure that your
chicken is cooked to at least 160 degrees,

39:56.020 --> 39:59.290
and I'm reducing down the
sauce a little bit, nice and gentle.

39:59.290 --> 40:03.660
Fried rice. Have our warm
pan, canola, butter, garlic.

40:03.660 --> 40:05.660
Annatto seed.
It's in the achiote tree.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.770
And it is used as a food dye.

40:07.770 --> 40:09.470
Add in our rice.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.870
When you plating the eggplant,
all of that pickle-liquid that's in there,

40:13.870 --> 40:15.670
we don't want that.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.410
And then I like to finish the
eggplant with a little bit of olive oil.

40:18.410 --> 40:24.880
My chicken right onto the rice and
then the saucy stuff around the chicken.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.150
Are you guys ready?
You wanna try it?

40:26.150 --> 40:27.920
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.860
<i>♪ Chow town, I'm 'bout to go
To town ♪</i>

40:31.860 --> 40:34.160
- Oh, my word!
- Oh, my God.

40:34.160 --> 40:38.130
- This is so good.
- You all have 75 minutes

40:38.130 --> 40:43.100
to break down a chicken, call
for a chef check and then recreate

40:43.100 --> 40:49.240
our chicken adobo recipe, Filipino
fried rice and charred eggplant salad

40:49.240 --> 40:50.810
exactly.

40:50.810 --> 40:52.280
Yeah, easy-peasy. Yeah.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.340
- Are you all ready?
- Yes.

40:53.350 --> 40:55.310
- Absolutely.
- Great, time starts now.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.380
- [all exclaiming]
- Let's go!

40:56.380 --> 40:57.950
- Oh...
- Ooh!

40:57.950 --> 40:59.120
Oh, baby!

41:00.690 --> 41:02.890
- Damn, girl.
- We got this, babies.

41:02.890 --> 41:04.420
Just remember to focus,
Blue Team.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.930
<i>[singing] ♪ We're gonna stop

41:06.930 --> 41:08.190

41:08.200 --> 41:11.660
Hello, little chicken, we're
gonna have some fun today.

41:12.100 --> 41:13.160
Oh!

41:13.170 --> 41:14.930
Hector, hurry up
and get your chicken out.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.100
Okay, okay.

41:16.740 --> 41:17.770
I'm on it.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.080
- Ha!
- [Cheyenne] Breaking down this chicken.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.780
Place breast up, breast is soft.

41:30.780 --> 41:33.150
Wiggle the leg,
popped that elbow,

41:33.150 --> 41:34.520
cut away a little bit
of the fat.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.060
I wish it was this easy to
cut the fat off of me.

41:39.990 --> 41:41.290
- [Anne] Kara!
- Yes.

41:41.430 --> 41:44.130
You gotta use your knife, doll,
you can't rip those wings off.

41:44.130 --> 41:46.230
[grunts] All the way down!

41:46.230 --> 41:48.430
[grunts] To its carcass.

41:53.170 --> 41:55.470
This chicken
ain't crossing that road.

41:56.410 --> 42:00.040
Ah! Oh! I think I popped
it. I think I popped it.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.280
I knew you could pop that hip.

42:01.280 --> 42:04.280
- Honey, I can pop a hip, okay?
- I know you can.

42:04.280 --> 42:09.220
Oh! Oh... God! You poor thing.
I'm so sorry, girl.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.690
[retches] Oh!

42:11.690 --> 42:14.890
I hope your rooster did good
things for you when you were alive.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.330
Uh-oh. I think I gotta
break it again.

42:17.330 --> 42:20.130
Oh, please don't break, please
don't break in the wrong place.

42:20.130 --> 42:23.800
This chicken
is taking forever, ever-ever.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.100
It looked so much easier
when she did it.

42:26.110 --> 42:28.470
- I've already someone say...
- Chef check.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.110
- Chef check.
- Chef check.

42:30.110 --> 42:31.040
That's clean.

42:32.110 --> 42:32.940
What?

42:32.950 --> 42:34.880
Oh, man! Where is it?
Where is it?

42:34.880 --> 42:38.220
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.
Keep cutting along the bone, Deneise.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.950
I'm pretty
frazzled at this point.

42:39.950 --> 42:41.390
<i>Just too much going on.</i>

42:41.390 --> 42:45.220
There's only one hour left, I
hope you got that bird butchered.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.120
- What?
- One hour!

42:46.130 --> 42:48.160
I haven't even done anything.

42:48.160 --> 42:51.660
I gotta get this chicken done. Or
else I'm not gonna win that 25,000.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.870
- Deneise, make-- Deneise.
- Okay.

42:53.870 --> 42:55.000
Listen. No, wait, listen.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.970
I just... I can't think!

42:56.970 --> 42:59.140
- Did I pop it right?
- No!

43:03.980 --> 43:08.280
There's only one hour left! I
hope you got that bird butchered.

43:08.280 --> 43:11.420
- What? I haven't even done anything.
- One hour!

43:17.060 --> 43:18.760
This is the leg bone, right?

43:18.760 --> 43:20.360
- Okay, so I need to...
- That connects right here.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.660
- Right there. Got it. Yup.
- Look, feel this. Feel-- No, feel it.

43:22.660 --> 43:24.300
Watching Deneise
butcher this chicken,

43:24.300 --> 43:27.400
<i>it's like watching a cat
trying to open a soda bottle.</i>

43:27.400 --> 43:28.930
There's only so much I can do.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.070
Pickle.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.840
<i>I mean, I like him and all.</i>

43:32.840 --> 43:35.140
But that's a little bit
too close.

43:35.140 --> 43:37.180
- [crew member laughs]
- I'm just saying.

43:37.180 --> 43:38.340
I'll be all right, don't worry.

43:45.350 --> 43:47.750
- Oh!
- Whoa!

43:47.750 --> 43:49.950
No, no, no, no, Hilda.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.020
Cut that in half, cut the
stem end off. Remember?

43:53.030 --> 43:55.030
- Stem?
- That's the hairy end.

43:55.030 --> 43:58.130
What? does it need a wig? I
don't know what she's talking about.

43:58.130 --> 44:00.370
<i>Hairy, hairy,
hairy, hairy, hairy...</i>

44:00.370 --> 44:03.430
Please, somebody, help me.
[chuckles]

44:03.440 --> 44:06.000
Oh, this part. Yes.

44:06.970 --> 44:08.240
My bad.

44:08.240 --> 44:11.240
Oh, my God, Hilda, please
get it right, please get it right.

44:11.240 --> 44:14.910
No, no! Hilda, that's not the
direction I sliced the onion.

44:14.910 --> 44:16.910
Slice it towards the hairy end.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.450
- Slice it...
- No, you gotta get a new onion.

44:19.450 --> 44:21.850
We're about to have an
onion shortage in this country

44:21.860 --> 44:24.290
because all the onions
I'm going through.

44:24.290 --> 44:26.960
- You have diced onion for your eggplant.
- One yellow...

44:26.960 --> 44:29.090
- that's all I need.
- You need sliced onion

44:29.100 --> 44:31.160
- Sliced onion... Right.
- For the chicken.

44:31.160 --> 44:34.130
Slice towards the hairy end.
No.

44:34.130 --> 44:38.040
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
have dreams of onions.

44:38.070 --> 44:39.240
[scoffs]

44:39.240 --> 44:43.210
Oh, my God, this is
gonna send me all--

44:43.210 --> 44:45.680
Hilda, can you please
slice your onion?

44:46.250 --> 44:47.810
No, still no.

44:48.080 --> 44:51.450
I'll never be the same. I'll never look
at another onion the same way again.

44:51.450 --> 44:54.190
<i>- Oh, my gosh! [chuckles]
- Now, cut the hairy end off.</i>

44:55.950 --> 44:57.060
There, it's sliced.

44:57.060 --> 44:58.290
Thank you, Chef Anne.

45:00.030 --> 45:02.190
Have to get started
on my eggplant.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.900
There's not really
a natural curve on this...

45:04.900 --> 45:06.900
Oh, that one
doesn't curve a lot!

45:06.900 --> 45:09.030
Some of them
curve more than others, Al.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.170
[laughing]

45:11.170 --> 45:13.670
- That's what they say.
- [chuckling] Some curve more than others.

45:13.670 --> 45:17.880
- So, you know, they've all got their own unique anatomy.
- Hey, this is a G-rated show.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.550
I'm talking about eggplants. I don't
know what you're thinking about.

45:28.690 --> 45:32.120
[Marti] Oh, [bleep], she's
burning. Oh, [bleep], okay, we're...

45:32.130 --> 45:34.430
Brown food tastes good!
[chuckles]

45:34.430 --> 45:37.230
[Peachez]
Brown food tastes good!

45:37.230 --> 45:39.230
Don't be mocking my Chef Anne.

45:39.230 --> 45:42.000
- [laughs]
- Thank you, Al.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
How's it coming?

45:43.100 --> 45:44.800
It's good, it's good.

45:45.100 --> 45:50.070
We really want the Blue Team to win and
we know that there's $1,000 at stake here.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.210
- The palm.
- Thank you, love.

45:51.210 --> 45:54.010
So we decide we all need to
communicate together...

45:54.010 --> 45:56.250
- Did you drizzle olive oil?
- No, thank you.

45:56.250 --> 45:58.520
Work together and be a team...

45:58.520 --> 46:01.290
- I'm gonna flip yours, too. I want some char, so.
- Oh, shoot...

46:01.290 --> 46:03.220
- So, okay cool. Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

46:03.220 --> 46:05.660
So that one of us
gets this money.

46:05.660 --> 46:08.930
Hector, you're still in first
gear. Let's go. Come on.

46:08.930 --> 46:11.130
- The peppercorn doesn't go here with the chicken, then?
- No.

46:11.130 --> 46:13.660
Put the peppercorn aside.
Okay?

46:13.670 --> 46:15.870
There's three voices
in my head right now.

46:15.870 --> 46:18.900
<i>- Angie...
- Hector, your fire's hella hot!</i>

46:18.910 --> 46:22.440
<i>- Chef Anne...
- Hector, Hector, Hector!</i>

46:22.440 --> 46:26.680
- And the spirit of Bianca.
- Hector! [grunts] Hurry up!

46:30.650 --> 46:33.320
I feel like
I'm in second gear right now.

46:33.320 --> 46:34.650
I'm cruising by.

46:35.350 --> 46:36.990
[Angie gasps] Oh!

46:36.990 --> 46:40.020
This is unexpected.
A huge ball of fire.

46:40.030 --> 46:42.460
[explosion]

46:42.460 --> 46:44.960
I already paint on
my eyebrows, Hector.

46:44.960 --> 46:46.500
I wanna keep the hair I have.

46:46.500 --> 46:49.100
Why is fire coming out
of this? Come on.

46:49.900 --> 46:51.400
That was fun.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.910
Can you turn this down
a little bit for me, please?

46:53.910 --> 46:56.410
Why is Peachez telling me
to move her knobs?

46:56.410 --> 46:58.380
So you want me to turn it down?

46:58.380 --> 47:00.380
- If we can, that would be great.
- All right.

47:00.380 --> 47:02.510
That didn't move it at all.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.180
Turn your own doggone knobs.

47:04.180 --> 47:05.880
Where's high?

47:05.890 --> 47:10.120
Deneise must've got some steam
in her glasses, because she can't tell

47:10.120 --> 47:12.220
which knob controls
which burner...

47:12.230 --> 47:14.060
Turn that middle burner on.

47:14.060 --> 47:16.790
- Oh, this middle burner?
- Deneise, can you turn mine back on?

47:16.800 --> 47:20.300
Deneise, if you
ruin this cook for me,

47:20.300 --> 47:22.830
ooh, honey,
we're gonna have words.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.200
Sorry, I think it got
turned off in the confusion.

47:25.210 --> 47:27.210
And they are not gonna be nice.

47:27.210 --> 47:28.870
- [Deneise] Right there.
- Use the roadmap.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.240
Slide it to the one
in the front.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.710
Where is the front?

47:34.050 --> 47:36.910
I hate stoves. I really do.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.980
Adding the palm sugar
to my sauce.

47:38.990 --> 47:43.120
I have the onion in, I have the
garlic in, the soya sauce, the vinegar.

47:43.120 --> 47:46.160
It's really going good I feel
like. Better add these bay leaves.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.460
Then Chef Cliff comes over...

47:47.460 --> 47:49.090
Chef Cliff how's that
chicken look? Good?

47:49.360 --> 47:50.390
Not good?

47:50.400 --> 47:52.100
Oh, thank you!

47:52.100 --> 47:54.330
And he gives me a fist bump.

47:54.330 --> 47:55.670
Doing okay.

47:55.670 --> 47:57.370
I don't remember anything
after that. [chuckles]

47:57.370 --> 47:59.170
Cheyenne, you're doing great!

47:59.170 --> 48:01.310
- You're doing great!
- Thank you so much.

48:01.310 --> 48:03.640
I'm so nervous, is this
supposed to go in the fried rice?

48:03.640 --> 48:05.940
No! No, no.

48:05.950 --> 48:08.180
Thank you. [chuckles]

48:08.180 --> 48:12.150
I'm thinking to myself "Something's
missing," and I can't figure it out.

48:12.150 --> 48:15.220
So, Chef Anne, I'm gonna put
this in my bowl now, the rice?

48:15.290 --> 48:16.620
No.

48:17.020 --> 48:19.260
- Not hot with the cold?
- Do the rice and the eggplant go together?

48:19.260 --> 48:20.190
No.

48:20.190 --> 48:21.990
[whispers] Oh, that's right.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.830
Something's missing out
of here, though.

48:23.830 --> 48:26.760
You have the garlic, the
butter, the oil, the annatto?

48:26.770 --> 48:29.370
That's it. Okay, okay.
Let's call it a day.

48:29.370 --> 48:31.840
[chuckles] I forgot the
garlic. I totally lied to her.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.070
Oh, my gosh, I just lied to her.

48:34.070 --> 48:36.370
Not to Chef Anne, no, no, no.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.640
She's coming!

48:39.750 --> 48:41.080
She didn't see that.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.910
If Chef Anne finds out that
I'm a liar,

48:42.920 --> 48:44.520
she is not gonna want me
on her team,

48:44.520 --> 48:46.980
and I'm freaked out about that.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.390
Oh, yeah.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.190
Oh, God!

48:51.190 --> 48:54.530
Can't get caught up
in all the small details here.

48:54.530 --> 48:57.860
The chicken is the star. I don't
know. I gotta cook some stuff.

48:57.860 --> 49:00.930
I don't have a lot of time
left. I think I'm falling behind.

49:00.930 --> 49:03.330
<i>I mean, I don't know what I'm
supposed to put in the sauce.</i>

49:03.340 --> 49:04.900
I've got palm sugar.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.100
Oh...

49:07.040 --> 49:08.610
What am I...

49:09.010 --> 49:11.010
I'm putting the palm... Do I put the
palm sugar in with the white vinegar?

49:11.010 --> 49:12.080
No, sir!

49:12.080 --> 49:14.280
I'm so in my head right now.
The clock is ticking.

49:14.280 --> 49:15.680
[Anne] 15 minutes remain.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.250
Come on.

49:17.250 --> 49:20.220
Given that this is an elimination
round, I'm starting to freak out.

49:20.220 --> 49:22.190
Cook, baby!

49:22.190 --> 49:25.490
I can't do-- I can't
multitask. I have to...

49:25.490 --> 49:28.260
But this joker's gotta cook,
'cause that's a nice-looking leg.

49:28.260 --> 49:29.330
Breathe, Edward.

49:29.330 --> 49:30.760
Pressure's mounting.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.100
Is this yours or mine?
This is mine, isn't it?

49:32.100 --> 49:33.260
That's yours,
'cause mine's done.

49:33.270 --> 49:34.430
Oh, what do I do with this?

49:34.430 --> 49:36.930
I mean, it's a crapshoot, like,

49:36.940 --> 49:38.900
<i>- who does this?
- [narrator] She does.</i>

49:38.910 --> 49:40.240
Put your pickle in it.

49:40.240 --> 49:44.240
Who actually does this
and is 100% confident?

49:44.240 --> 49:45.680
<i>[narrator] This guy.</i>

49:45.680 --> 49:47.950
You can't tell me
anybody in this kitchen

49:47.950 --> 49:49.280
knows what they're doing.

49:49.280 --> 49:50.650
<i>[narrator] They do.</i>

49:51.080 --> 49:52.320
Bad.

49:58.460 --> 50:01.190
I don't know if I'm doing what
I'm supposed to do right now.

50:01.190 --> 50:03.030
The wheels are spinning.

50:06.970 --> 50:08.330
- Chef Cliff...
- Eddie, talk to me.

50:08.330 --> 50:10.430
Do I put the chicken
back in here and cover it?

50:10.440 --> 50:11.570
What is that?

50:12.400 --> 50:14.940
I don't know. Help, help.

50:14.940 --> 50:16.010
Okay, I'm here with you, Chef.

50:16.010 --> 50:17.440
- Breathe with me, breathe with me.
- Okay.

50:20.950 --> 50:26.320
[breathing heavily]

50:26.320 --> 50:28.220
Overall, I feel okay.

50:28.220 --> 50:29.250
You gotta stop panicking.

50:29.260 --> 50:30.220
I've given you
specific instructions

50:30.220 --> 50:31.890
- so that you can succeed.
- Yeah.

50:31.890 --> 50:34.260
As long as you listen to those
instructions, you'll be successful.

50:34.260 --> 50:37.190
Come on, like, "You can
do it, Eddie," like, come on!

50:37.200 --> 50:38.760
You can do this.

50:38.770 --> 50:40.930
- Eddie, you take the temperature?
- Yes.

50:40.930 --> 50:43.270
- Great. Deneise, you have the butter in there?
- Yes.

50:43.270 --> 50:45.140
- Great, Cheyenne...
- [Cheyenne] Yes.

50:45.140 --> 50:47.140
- Rice.
- No.

50:47.140 --> 50:49.510
- Yes. Okay.
- Spread... yes.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.180
[Peachez]
How are you doing, Deneise?

50:52.210 --> 50:54.080
- Look it, we're cooking rice, honey!
- I'm okay.

50:54.080 --> 50:56.380
- I think so.
- We are doing it, baby!

51:01.490 --> 51:03.190
[Al] Oh, crap!

51:04.920 --> 51:06.260
Quarter teaspoon.

51:06.260 --> 51:07.490
Yow!

51:07.930 --> 51:08.990
Oops.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.360
That sucks.

51:10.360 --> 51:11.830
You have two-and-a-half minutes.

51:11.830 --> 51:14.330
You got two minutes
to get some flavor.

51:14.330 --> 51:17.100
[Anne] Home stretch, guys.
Let's go!

51:17.100 --> 51:20.000
[Hector] Let's put enough
in there. You know, just so...

51:20.010 --> 51:21.970
uh, there's enough
for both of the chefs.

51:21.970 --> 51:24.340
- Hector, stop talking and plate!
- They're gonna eat it all.

51:24.340 --> 51:27.240
You know, so I'm gonna put
enough rice for both of them.

51:31.650 --> 51:33.880
Melody, I feel like I haven't
seen you in three hours.

51:33.890 --> 51:35.920
- How you doing, girl?
- I'm okay. I'm plating, babe!

51:35.920 --> 51:39.220
- Word?
- I know, for the first time! [chuckles softly]

51:39.230 --> 51:41.490
[Anne] Kara, get your
chicken on the plate.

51:41.490 --> 51:42.960
- Your chicken.
- [Kara] Yes, Chef.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.330
Let's go. Come on!

51:44.330 --> 51:46.060
[Cliff] Recruits, one minute.

51:47.100 --> 51:48.930
Cheyenne, okay, so grab
another plate.

51:48.940 --> 51:50.400
[Cheyenne] It's okay,
I can wipe it off.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.000
- Okay, you do you.
- Okay.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.340
Ten seconds.

51:54.170 --> 51:57.010
[Cliff] Eight, seven, six,

51:57.010 --> 52:01.480
[Cliff and Anne] Five, four,
three, two, one.

52:01.480 --> 52:02.980
- [Cliff] Hands off, don't touch.
- [Anne] That's it,

52:02.980 --> 52:04.650
hands up, you're done.

52:04.650 --> 52:07.720
- Whoo-hoo!
- [Anne] All right.

52:07.720 --> 52:11.060
- Eddie, that looks amazing!
- Yeah, baby!

52:11.060 --> 52:14.230
- [chuckles] - All right, Cliff, you
ready to go try some chicken?

52:14.230 --> 52:15.460
[Cliff] No.

52:15.460 --> 52:18.430
Recruits, let's see how you did.

52:18.430 --> 52:21.130
- Ooh!
- Melody, you're first up.

52:21.130 --> 52:23.000
[Peachez] Yes, Melody!

52:28.410 --> 52:30.070
<i>[Melody sighs] Oh, my God!</i>

52:30.080 --> 52:32.180
Come on, give it to me!

52:32.180 --> 52:33.810
- You did a great freaking job.
- Mmm-hmm.

52:33.810 --> 52:35.850
He really liked my dish!

52:35.850 --> 52:38.050
You got beautiful
caramelization on the exterior.

52:38.050 --> 52:39.780
- The sauce tastes great.
- The piece of eggplant

52:39.790 --> 52:42.490
that I had was not cooked
all the way through.

52:42.490 --> 52:44.820
- But I thought you did a nice job plating.
- I'm really proud of you.

52:44.820 --> 52:46.890
- I'm proud of me, too.
- Al!

52:46.890 --> 52:49.860
Come on up.
How did you find today?

52:49.860 --> 52:51.330
It was actually kinda fun today,

52:51.330 --> 52:54.170
I got outta first gear, went
to second gear, kept trucking

52:54.170 --> 52:55.470
and here we are.

52:55.470 --> 52:56.500
[tires screeching]

52:56.500 --> 52:57.600
Eat my dust.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.970
[explosion]

52:58.970 --> 53:01.870
The rice is nicely cooked.
Your knife cuts on your eggplant

53:01.870 --> 53:04.010
and your onions and tomatoes
look good,

53:04.010 --> 53:06.440
and there's definitely lots of
seasoning on that. Whoo!

53:06.450 --> 53:08.450
We got the color from
the annatto seed,

53:08.450 --> 53:10.750
but you didn't blend
the annatto seed.

53:10.750 --> 53:14.190
- Oh, did you get one?
- Yeah, I ate two of them. You know, jagged pieces

53:14.190 --> 53:17.090
as you're eating it are just
really jarring to the palate.

53:17.090 --> 53:21.660
- Those damn seeds!
- But you did an excellent job butchering your chicken.

53:21.660 --> 53:22.590
Nice job, Al.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.000
Cheyenne, show us what you made.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.930
I feel better about this dish
than anything I've made so far.

53:28.940 --> 53:31.300
[Cliff] Knife cuts on the
onion and tomato are good.

53:31.300 --> 53:33.970
With this-- exception of this
one piece staring me down.

53:36.010 --> 53:38.110
The chicken is quite moist.

53:38.110 --> 53:39.580
The only other thing
I really have to add

53:39.580 --> 53:41.110
is that we're
missing the scallions.

53:41.250 --> 53:42.180
Yes.

53:42.180 --> 53:43.880
Bianca, please join us.

53:43.880 --> 53:46.150
- How do you feel?
- I feel good, I think.

53:46.150 --> 53:47.920
[Cliff] The eggplant salad,
flavors are great.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.290
- The rice, did you add any annatto?
- Mmm-hmm.

53:50.290 --> 53:53.190
Something's wrong. Because it
would be really yellow if you did.

53:53.190 --> 53:54.690
Yeah, it would be like...
[whistles]

53:54.690 --> 53:57.960
I had thought I had grind it
and put it in there but, okay.

53:57.960 --> 53:59.930
I want it to be saucier.

53:59.930 --> 54:01.970
So, it's like chicken and sauce.

54:01.970 --> 54:03.170
But they should be
chicken and sauce.

54:03.170 --> 54:03.930
Thank you.

54:03.940 --> 54:05.240
Eddie.

54:05.400 --> 54:06.800
<i>[Eddie] I'm looking down at
my dish and I'm astonished.</i>

54:06.810 --> 54:08.840
<i>I feel like
I'm the ultimate champion.</i>

54:08.840 --> 54:12.080
It looks perfect. I've never
made anything look so beautiful.

54:13.980 --> 54:16.380
Your knife cuts, we need work.

54:16.380 --> 54:19.080
This... this looks like
a complete rush hack job.

54:19.180 --> 54:20.920
Wah, wah.

54:20.920 --> 54:24.290
The consistency of the sauce looked
good. There's just not enough of it.

54:24.290 --> 54:28.260
It's a complete plate of food but it's
the knife cuts and the burnt chicken

54:28.260 --> 54:30.460
that really are the big
sticking points for me.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.360
Angie, come on up.

54:32.370 --> 54:35.170
I'm definitely hoping Chef Anne
doesn't see that I missed the sauce,

54:35.170 --> 54:36.870
<i>but it's a little obvious.</i>

54:36.870 --> 54:39.240
- Where's your sauce?
- I completely forgot it.

54:39.240 --> 54:41.010
- Okay.
- Oops!

54:42.310 --> 54:45.280
Your knife cuts on you
tomatoes and onions look nice.

54:45.280 --> 54:47.880
You did a nice job
butchering your chicken.

54:47.880 --> 54:50.980
But your chicken is dry.

54:52.350 --> 54:55.250
- Like, across the board, more seasoning.
- Okay.

54:55.250 --> 54:58.420
- Hector, come on up.
- That's a nice plate, boo.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.990
[Hector] There you go. Enjoy.

54:59.990 --> 55:01.260
There's no sauce.
What happened?

55:01.260 --> 55:03.160
[stammers] Did you just
forget to put it on there?

55:03.160 --> 55:04.760
Yeah, I just forgot to plate it.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.670
[Anne] With the exception of the sauce,
you got pretty much all the pieces there.

55:07.670 --> 55:11.200
The knife cuts look good. Your
eggplant, however, is not cooked.

55:11.200 --> 55:14.670
And there is no seasoning
anywhere on this plate.

55:14.670 --> 55:16.870
This is your best-looking plate,

55:16.880 --> 55:19.080
I just wish that
it tasted better.

55:19.080 --> 55:22.310
- [coughs] No flavor.
- Gotta use that salt, my friend.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.550
At least, you know, we
can take a good picture of it.

55:25.380 --> 55:26.520
Kara, come on up.

55:26.790 --> 55:30.950
I put my blood, sweat
and tears into this dish.

55:30.960 --> 55:33.090
<i>And this is as good as it gets.</i>

55:33.190 --> 55:34.930
That's really sad.

55:35.230 --> 55:38.960
- [Anne] I think your eggplant got a little bit too charred.
- [chuckles] A little bit.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.270
But I'm not finding your
sauce and the annatto in there.

55:42.270 --> 55:44.700
I'm gonna cry,
because that's what I do.

55:44.700 --> 55:48.640
I cry when I'm happy, I cry
when I'm sad, I've cried at school,

55:48.640 --> 55:53.210
on the softball field, fast food
drive-thru, in my bath, when...

55:53.710 --> 55:55.250
the wind blows.

55:55.250 --> 55:58.980
And now, I've cried in front
of Chef Anne and Chef Cliff.

55:59.920 --> 56:00.680
Awkward.

56:00.690 --> 56:04.020
I am not a cook.
As you can see.

56:04.020 --> 56:08.730
I feel like I actually am the worst
cook they've ever had on the show.

56:08.730 --> 56:10.090
[sobbing]

56:14.300 --> 56:17.200
I just want to do better. [voice
shaking] And I hate to struggle.

56:17.200 --> 56:21.440
My tears are falling out of
my eyes like Niagara Falls.

56:21.440 --> 56:24.980
I wanna let everybody know
that I'm okay.

56:24.980 --> 56:27.340
But this is just how
I deal with things.

56:27.350 --> 56:29.980
I hate it. But it's part of...

56:30.250 --> 56:31.320
my process.

56:31.920 --> 56:33.250
[chuckles] Like, okay...

56:33.250 --> 56:35.050
thank you, Kara,
for letting us know.

56:35.050 --> 56:38.190
Okay, well, you definitely
took some steps forward today.

56:38.190 --> 56:40.320
- Thank you.
- Butcher on the chicken looks great.

56:40.330 --> 56:42.890
I can taste that the
chicken itself is seasoned.

56:42.900 --> 56:47.130
It's like I need you to show
up with "Grr!" and not...

56:47.130 --> 56:48.630
- [whimpers]
- Right.

56:48.630 --> 56:50.130
Deneise, come on up.

56:50.140 --> 56:52.200
<i>[Deneise] I tried to look cute
walking up there, because, well...</i>

56:52.200 --> 56:53.940
[laughs]

56:53.940 --> 56:56.110
All else fails, look cute.

56:57.980 --> 57:00.680
I feel like I went on a personal
journey with you cooking this dish.

57:00.680 --> 57:03.310
You spent a lot of meaningful
time with me and I appreciate it.

57:05.020 --> 57:07.150
- I think the chicken is cooked though.
- [Anne] Oh, yeah.

57:07.150 --> 57:08.350
- She's cooked.
- The chicken's dry.

57:08.690 --> 57:09.850
[gasps]

57:09.860 --> 57:10.750
- Oh, yeah, she dry.
- Yeah.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.290
There's not enough garlic
in your rice.

57:12.290 --> 57:15.260
- I'm pleased with the knife cuts on the scallion and...
- [Deneise] Mmm-hmm.

57:15.260 --> 57:18.130
The onion,
some of the tomato are janky.

57:18.130 --> 57:22.300
All in all, you got everything on
the plate which is unbelievable.

57:22.300 --> 57:23.230
Mmm-hmm.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.370
Hilda.

57:25.940 --> 57:27.240
All right!

57:27.240 --> 57:29.670
I though you did a pretty good
job butchering your chicken.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.680
Onions, on the other hand,

57:31.680 --> 57:34.810
you're keeping the onion
farmers in business today.

57:34.810 --> 57:35.680
[Hilda] Yes.

57:35.680 --> 57:38.980
Your chicken and sauce
is really yummy.

57:38.980 --> 57:40.980
You did justice to the chicken.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.250
Thank you.

57:42.250 --> 57:43.890
- Peachez.
- Ow!

57:43.890 --> 57:45.690
I am feeling confident,

57:45.690 --> 57:48.790
my plate looks good,
I've tasted everything.

57:48.790 --> 57:50.090
<i>But I don't know anymore.</i>

57:50.100 --> 57:52.860
Think it tastes great.
I hope you do, too.

57:52.870 --> 57:54.400
You did a fantastic job
with the butchery.

57:54.400 --> 57:57.200
The seer that you got
on your chicken, unbelievable.

57:57.200 --> 58:00.300
The sauce didn't reduce enough which
is why it's very, very loose on the plate.

58:00.310 --> 58:01.910
Garnishes are important,

58:01.910 --> 58:03.310
- you know.
- It's like your accessories.

58:03.310 --> 58:04.510
[laughs]

58:04.510 --> 58:07.040
When you go to accessorize,
you want that to be flashy.

58:07.050 --> 58:09.780
- When it's not...
- It goes from flashy to trashy.

58:09.780 --> 58:12.050
- Oh, no, no, that's my daughter.
- Hey, hey now.

58:12.050 --> 58:13.480
- That's my daughter.
- [Peachez] Whoa!

58:13.490 --> 58:16.850
Marti, what a dish with a dish.

58:16.860 --> 58:18.460
[Marti] There you are, my loves.

58:18.460 --> 58:21.290
Honey, this is the dish,
and she's spicy.

58:22.090 --> 58:23.960
Oh, please be good.

58:23.960 --> 58:26.660
- [Anne] Your chicken is cooked nicely.
- The chicken is very good.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.100
- You dig?
- I'm digging the chicken.

58:28.100 --> 58:29.870
- We're digging the...
- No, no, we're not done here. Come back...

58:29.870 --> 58:31.300
- We're not done yet.
- Come back, come back.

58:31.300 --> 58:34.670
- Sorry.
- What's missing here is the sauce is a little thin.

58:34.670 --> 58:36.510
- Yeah.
- It hasn't been reduced quite enough.

58:36.510 --> 58:38.440
But, overall, very good effort.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.820
Welcome back, recruits,

58:46.820 --> 58:49.690
and congratulations for almost

58:49.690 --> 58:53.360
making it through
your second week of boot camp.

58:53.360 --> 58:56.490
This week, some of you
proved to be brave warriors.

58:56.500 --> 58:59.360
While others not so much.

58:59.370 --> 59:03.830
Unfortunately, this battle
is over for one of you.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.340
Let's start with
the Rocking Red Stars.

Very nice job.

Peachez! Say it again!

1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:15.110

1:00:15.110 --> 1:00:19.640
The last recruit on the Rocking
Red Stars who is safe is...

1:00:19.650 --> 1:00:23.280
- Hector.
- [all clapping]

1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:24.980
Unfortunately, Kara,

1:00:24.980 --> 1:00:28.390
that means you're in the
bottom, so please step forward.

1:00:28.390 --> 1:00:32.390

1:00:47.810 --> 1:00:49.140
[Eddie] Thank you.

1:00:49.140 --> 1:00:52.240
Unfortunately, Deneise, this
means you're up for elimination.

1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:55.780
- Please, shimmy forward.
- [chuckles softly]

1:00:55.780 --> 1:00:57.610
[Anne] Kara, Deneise,

1:00:57.620 --> 1:01:02.650
this was a really difficult
decision for Cliff and I.

1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:06.960
But, for one of you, your
time in boot camp will be over.

1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:10.930
The recruit, that will not be
continuing on in boot camp is...

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.000
Deneise.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.030
[Kara] Oh!

1:01:15.030 --> 1:01:17.730
- [Al] Oh.
- [exhales]

1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:20.440
Deneise, I'm so sorry, but I'm
gonna have to ask you for your apron.

1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:22.840
[whispering] Yeah, thank
you so much. Thank you.

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:24.210
<i>[Deneise] I had a lot of fun.</i>

1:01:24.210 --> 1:01:28.310
Met all these great people. I
think I improved significantly.

1:01:28.310 --> 1:01:30.750
- Learned a lot. I really did.
- Thank you for being here and you know what?

1:01:30.750 --> 1:01:32.380
You are Deneise the Destroyer.

1:01:32.380 --> 1:01:34.790
- [chuckles] Yeah! Thank you so much.
- [Anne] All right?

1:01:34.790 --> 1:01:37.250
I do believe that my family
will be very proud of me.

- [all clapping]
- Thank you.

1:01:40.860 --> 1:01:42.990
Yes, I'm gonna cook when I

After all I just learned.
[chuckles]

1:01:45.460 --> 1:01:46.800
[Eddie] I'm gonna miss you.

1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:49.130
No, none of this
is going to waste.

1:01:49.130 --> 1:01:53.200
And I'm gonna have a picture of
Chef Cliff in my kitchen. Yes, I will.

1:01:53.210 --> 1:01:57.110
[all clapping]

1:01:57.840 --> 1:01:59.340
All right, Kara.

1:01:59.340 --> 1:02:00.510
Go back and rejoin your team.

1:02:00.510 --> 1:02:01.980
Thank you so much, y'all.

- Hilda, because you won this week's challenge...
- Yes.

1:02:08.090 --> 1:02:09.920
On the Red Team,

you get to take home $1,000!

1:02:13.060 --> 1:02:16.460
[all cheering]

1:02:16.460 --> 1:02:21.360
$1,000, baby. It's time
for Hilda to go shopping.

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.870
Now, go home and get some rest,

1:02:26.870 --> 1:02:29.370
because next week, it's
gonna be a real beach.

1:02:29.370 --> 1:02:30.440
[all exclaiming]

1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:31.680
[surf music playing]

1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:33.910
All right? Bye-bye!

1:02:33.910 --> 1:02:35.310
- Thank you.

<i>[narrator] Hey, get outta here.</i>

1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:40.250
<i>Next time on
Worst Cooks in America...</i>

1:02:40.250 --> 1:02:42.450
[Cliff] We're throwing you
in the deep end today.

1:02:42.450 --> 1:02:44.650
[screaming]

1:02:44.660 --> 1:02:46.220
Pure chaos right now.

1:02:46.230 --> 1:02:48.190
<i>[Peachez] Oh, boy!
Not my good hair.</i>

1:02:48.190 --> 1:02:50.030
Not my good hair
around that fire.

1:02:50.030 --> 1:02:52.760
<i>[Anne] Today, Cliff and I
are firing up the grill.</i>

1:02:52.770 --> 1:02:54.660
Oh, shoot!

1:02:54.670 --> 1:02:57.030
I think my chances of
staying at boot camp...

1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.640
- [explosion]
<i>- Just went up in flames.</i>
