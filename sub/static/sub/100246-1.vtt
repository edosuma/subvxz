[man] Good morning. Um...

00:42.500 --> 00:45.541
I am looking for a flight

[man] I-- I know I can book it
on the Internet,

[operator] Name?

00:53.666 --> 00:55.250
Bergoglio. Jorge Bergoglio.

00:56.083 --> 00:57.333
[operator] Like the pope?

00:57.583 --> 01:00.666
[Bergoglio chuckles] Oh, well...
Well, yes. Uh, in fact, um--

[Bergoglio] I'm-- I'm not sure, um...

[children shouting]

01:18.041 --> 01:21.166
[Bergoglio, in Spanish] Once,
a young man was walking

01:21.250 --> 01:22.291
in the woods.

01:25.041 --> 01:28.083
His name was Francesco Bernardone.

01:30.041 --> 01:32.625
Suddenly, he found a chapel...

01:32.708 --> 01:34.458
ruined,

01:34.541 --> 01:37.791
with the walls destroyed.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.083
He stepped inside.

01:39.791 --> 01:41.916
A crucifix was still there,

01:42.541 --> 01:45.041
where the altar had been.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.500
[indistinct chatter]

01:46.583 --> 01:51.500
[Bergoglio] Francesco felt captivated.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.458
The crucifix spoke to him and said,

01:54.750 --> 01:57.791
“Francesco, repair my Church.”

01:57.875 --> 02:00.083
[man shouting]

02:00.166 --> 02:02.375
[Bergoglio] Francesco was a practical man.

02:02.458 --> 02:05.125
He went up to the quarry on Mount Subasio,

02:05.458 --> 02:06.958
cut stones,

02:07.916 --> 02:09.500
carted them down the mountain,

02:10.291 --> 02:13.333
and repaired the broken walls.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.083
[over speakers] Any journey,

02:17.875 --> 02:19.458
no matter how long...

02:20.500 --> 02:22.875
has to start somewhere.

02:22.958 --> 02:23.875
[feedback squeals]

02:23.958 --> 02:27.208
[Bergoglio] Any journey,
no matter how glorious,

02:27.708 --> 02:29.416
can start with a mistake.

02:29.666 --> 02:33.125
So, when you feel lost,

02:33.208 --> 02:34.500
don’t worry.

02:35.416 --> 02:38.125
God will not give up.

02:38.708 --> 02:39.625

Understood?

02:42.166 --> 02:44.250
[crowd] ¡Sí!

02:45.000 --> 02:46.458
[Bergoglio] I’ve been thinking...

02:46.541 --> 02:49.250
We have many troubles here.

02:51.083 --> 02:56.375
It’s not fair to leave it all to Our Lady.

02:56.875 --> 03:01.541
Who else could pray for us?

03:05.875 --> 03:07.666
Let's see... young man!

What’s your name?

03:08.875 --> 03:10.458
-Lorenzo!

04:01.083 --> 04:04.666
[solemn choral music playing]

04:06.750 --> 04:08.500
[Bergoglio, in Italian] Brothers
and sisters,

04:08.750 --> 04:13.166
our beloved Holy Father John Paul II

04:13.500 --> 04:16.083
has returned to the Lord's house.

04:16.375 --> 04:18.625
[reporter, in English] He was a champion
of human rights

04:18.708 --> 04:20.541
who fought for justice for the poor

04:20.625 --> 04:23.000
and reached out across all faiths
for unity.

04:23.541 --> 04:26.416
But in sharp contrast,
John Paul II's papacy

04:26.500 --> 04:29.166
also marked a clear end to liberalization

04:29.375 --> 04:31.875
and a return
to the Church's harsh condemnation

04:31.958 --> 04:33.958
-of homosexuality, abortion...
-[wind howling]

04:34.041 --> 04:34.916

Cardinal Husar.

This?

04:46.333 --> 04:48.208
Cardinal Arinze of Nigeria.

04:48.291 --> 04:50.708
Many say he will be

In Rome, 115 cardinals from 52 countries

and the Italian reformist, Carlo Martini.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.166
[reporter 6] Ratzinger is a central figure
in the Vatican

05:34.250 --> 05:37.208

the natural successor to John Paul II.

to this glory.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.125
This is Europe...

Our churches are beautiful but empty,

06:28.291 --> 06:30.125
like a fire covered in ash.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.125
We need someone to blow the ash away.

06:33.750 --> 06:34.583
You.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.708
Someone outside of Europe is better.

[Bergoglio] No, Martini. Not me.

07:51.708 --> 07:54.250

will be through that chimney.

This means
that no candidate has achieved...

-The world just tipped on its axis.
-[Hummes] Martini got nine.

11:23.708 --> 11:26.625
So, it's 19 votes for a real change.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.958
If he tells his followers
to transfer their votes to you--

11:30.041 --> 11:32.791
Reform needs a politician.

11:33.541 --> 11:34.375
Hm?

11:34.666 --> 11:38.541
Transfer your votes to Martini.
He has worked for reform for years.

11:38.625 --> 11:40.041
It's too late for that.

11:40.541 --> 11:41.375
What?

11:42.625 --> 11:46.791
[Hummes] He's already asked anyone
who voted for him to vote for you instead.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.416
No, please.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.833
"The most important qualification

So...

He really wants it.

...are the following:

12:43.875 --> 12:45.500
[crowd cheers]

12:45.583 --> 12:47.333
[in English] It's white! It's white!

12:47.416 --> 12:49.875
[in Spanish] It's white!

12:49.958 --> 12:51.166
[reporter 1 speaking French]

12:51.250 --> 12:52.750
[reporter 2] Habemus Papam!

12:52.833 --> 12:54.125
[in English] We have a new pope!

12:54.208 --> 12:57.333
That will be the words announced
from that balcony up there.

12:57.416 --> 12:59.500
[cardinal speaking Italian over speakers]

13:00.875 --> 13:03.500
[speaking Spanish over speakers]

13:04.916 --> 13:07.250
[speaking French over speakers]

13:08.791 --> 13:11.333
[speaking German over speakers]

13:11.916 --> 13:14.416
[speaking Latin over speakers]

13:16.291 --> 13:17.416
Habemus Papam.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.958
[crowd cheering]

13:21.708 --> 13:25.083
[cardinal continues speaking Latin
over speakers]

13:25.166 --> 13:26.333
[bells ringing]

13:29.416 --> 13:31.583
[camera shutter clicking]

13:37.166 --> 13:39.125
[crowd cheers]

13:40.583 --> 13:42.041
[cardinal] Cardinale...

13:44.000 --> 13:45.208
Ratzinger!

13:45.291 --> 13:47.291
[crowd roars]

13:53.750 --> 13:56.541
[cardinal continues speaking Latin
over speakers]

14:01.416 --> 14:04.375
[man, in English] I think that,
rather  than a victory for conservatives,

14:04.458 --> 14:06.166
the election of Cardinal Ratzinger

14:06.291 --> 14:08.833
is actually a demonstration
of the unity of the Church.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.458
There weren't great divisions

14:10.541 --> 14:12.083
within the College of Cardinals.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.250
That it was a fairly easy choice

14:14.333 --> 14:16.000
to go with Cardinal Ratzinger...

14:16.916 --> 14:19.750
[wind whipping]

14:23.833 --> 14:26.000
[in Spanish] Jorge, what will you do now?

14:27.541 --> 14:29.083
Return to Buenos Aires,

14:29.541 --> 14:30.750
plan my retirement.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.208
You're too young to retire.

14:34.708 --> 14:39.958
[Bergoglio] The Church voted to make
overdue reforms remain overdue.

14:40.833 --> 14:46.458
I can do more good
as a simple parish priest.

14:49.541 --> 14:50.916
[in Portuguese] Okay.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
[bells ringing]

14:55.125 --> 14:56.791
[in Spanish] I'll pray for him.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.375
[gentle piano music playing]

15:01.000 --> 15:03.666
[in English]
Joseph Ratzinger has a sharp mind.

15:04.041 --> 15:05.625
He's, uh, an intellectual...

15:05.708 --> 15:08.041
[man 1] He's the...
the watchdog of the faith.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.125
[woman 1, in French]
This protects the Doctrine of the Faith.

15:10.208 --> 15:12.750
[woman 2, in English]
He's gonna fight... relativism.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.250
[reporter] What do you mean by that?

15:14.333 --> 15:16.833
Well, I mean,
he's-- he's going to stand up for dogma.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.208
He's gonna be a great pope.

15:18.291 --> 15:20.875
Oh, my God, this is the best...
I can't believe it.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.375
[man 2, in Portuguese]
He's already started with "no."

15:26.458 --> 15:28.791
"No against this, no against that..."

15:29.666 --> 15:34.041
It's bad for the poor in Brazil
and the poor in the world.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.458
[woman 3, in Spanish]
People are abandoning Catholicism

15:36.541 --> 15:39.500
because it is too conservative.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.791
[in English] I know Ratzinger.
The Nazi shouldn't have been elected.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.041
[bell chimes]

15:51.083 --> 15:53.083
[electric razor buzzing]

15:53.500 --> 15:55.416
[classical music playing over radio]

16:02.916 --> 16:04.041
[in Spanish] Bye, bye.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.375
[both speaking Spanish]

16:06.458 --> 16:08.708
Don't buy Tonio's stamps.

16:08.791 --> 16:10.541
-Oh... [laughs]
-They don't work.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.625
There’s nothing wrong with them.

16:13.708 --> 16:17.583
I wrote a beautiful letter, and no reply.

16:17.666 --> 16:18.541
Heh.

16:18.625 --> 16:22.250
Sent it again, still no reply.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.666
Your stamps don't work.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.541
Doesn't matter how good your letter was,
Jorge,

16:27.625 --> 16:29.958
San Lorenzo will never call you.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.208
[both laugh]

16:33.458 --> 16:35.791
Maybe you used the wrong address.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.500
Impossible.

16:37.791 --> 16:40.333
It’s a well-known address.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.750
To whom?

16:42.666 --> 16:43.708
The pope.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.125
[woman] Oh!

16:45.458 --> 16:46.458
So...

16:46.750 --> 16:49.250
Tonio's stamps work.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.625
I have your letters,
and this is from the Vatican.

16:52.708 --> 16:53.833
Gracias.

16:56.333 --> 16:58.041
Why the pope?

16:58.125 --> 16:59.416
I booked my flight.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.333
-Seriously?
-Mm-hmm.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.041
What's so urgent?

17:07.333 --> 17:08.791
You want to retire?

17:08.875 --> 17:10.208
Eh... sí.

17:10.291 --> 17:11.166
No!

17:11.583 --> 17:12.791
Don't do it.

17:13.208 --> 17:14.083
Oh...

17:14.166 --> 17:17.583
We need you in Buenos Aires. [sighs]

17:17.833 --> 17:19.750
He wants me in Rome.

17:19.833 --> 17:23.375
I booked my flight before this.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.125
A coincidence...

17:25.416 --> 17:27.541
There are no coincidences.

17:28.291 --> 17:30.708
We are all in God's hands.

17:30.791 --> 17:31.750
[woman] Mm-hmm.

17:33.166 --> 17:36.166
[praying in Latin]

17:36.916 --> 17:38.958
[reporter 1, in English]
We turn next to the Vatican

17:39.041 --> 17:41.208
and the stunning accusation
that's the talk of Rome.

17:41.625 --> 17:42.500
[thunder rumbles]

17:42.583 --> 17:46.208
Confidential Church documents
were allegedly leaked to the press...

17:46.625 --> 17:49.708
[reporter 2] Ridden with factionalism,
malpractice by the Vatican Bank,

17:49.791 --> 17:51.291
-and even sexual misconduct.
-[coughs]

17:51.375 --> 17:54.500
[reporter 3] Who would have believed
that one of the pope's most trusted aides,

17:54.583 --> 17:56.791
the man who helped, is under arrest?

17:56.875 --> 17:58.208
[speaking Italian]

17:58.291 --> 18:00.541
[reporter 4] ...leaking embarrassing
confidential Vatican documents...

18:00.625 --> 18:02.083
[reporter 5]
This dossier has only been read

18:02.166 --> 18:05.000
-by one guy: Pope Benedict XVI...
-[siren wails]

18:05.083 --> 18:06.750
...so he's fully aware of the issues...

18:06.833 --> 18:08.208
[reporter 6]
The whole thing is a holy mess.

18:08.291 --> 18:12.041
[reporter 7] There's no clarity as
to what happens behind those closed doors.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.416
[officer speaking Spanish]

18:13.958 --> 18:15.958
[indistinct chatter over PA]

18:22.166 --> 18:23.708
[thunder rumbles in distance]

18:31.625 --> 18:33.583
[plane engine roars]

18:34.500 --> 18:36.500
[indistinct chatter over PA]

18:46.041 --> 18:47.125
[Bergoglio] Ah, sì.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.208
[in Italian] Good morning.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.625
[in English] Are you
the cardinal archbishop of Buenos Aires?

18:50.708 --> 18:51.541
[Bergoglio] Yes.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.625
-Oh, Eminence, please--
-No, no, no, no, it's fine.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.208
-[in Italian] Buongiorno. How are you?
-Good, thank you.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.708
[in English] The car is just out here.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.083
[Bergoglio speaks Italian]

19:06.625 --> 19:07.583
[driver] This way.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.625
May I?

19:09.708 --> 19:10.958
-Oh, grazie.
-Grazie.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.166
Oh, Eminence... E-Eminence...

19:14.250 --> 19:16.416
No, no, I prefer to ride up front.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.666
-Grazie.
-Oh, very well.

19:18.375 --> 19:19.416
[engine starts]

19:21.291 --> 19:22.583
[Bergoglio] It's a beautiful car.

19:22.708 --> 19:25.125
-[driver] Thank you, Eminence.
-[Bergoglio] Very comfortable.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.458
[motorcycle engine revs]

19:27.916 --> 19:29.541
[Bergoglio] This is the way to Rome?

19:29.625 --> 19:32.083
[driver] No, no, Eminence.
The pope is in his summer residence.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.416
Oh. Summer residence. Ah.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.625
[slaps hands on lap]

19:36.708 --> 19:38.625
Perhaps that's why
he didn't get my letter.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.125
[driver] Uh, Eminence, forgive me, but...

19:41.208 --> 19:44.250
[stammers] ...he prefers to see
his bishops dressed like bishops

19:44.333 --> 19:46.500
and his cardinals like cardinals.

19:46.583 --> 19:47.791
Oh, really?

19:48.333 --> 19:50.541
Y-You have a spare cardinal's hat?

19:52.125 --> 19:53.791
[both chuckle]

19:53.875 --> 19:56.125
[bell ringing]

20:03.041 --> 20:05.750
[assistant, in Italian] Yes.
It's a private matter,

20:05.833 --> 20:07.666
so it's not in the official diary.

20:09.916 --> 20:11.916
[indistinct chatter]

20:12.833 --> 20:15.916
[assistant] He is reading the report.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.583
Yes, His Holiness is aware.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.083
I'll ask if he can speak to him.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.416
Your Holiness.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.750
-Would you speak to Cardinal Bertone?
-Ah...

20:30.666 --> 20:32.083
[assistant] I have him here.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.541
Ah. Grazie.

20:36.291 --> 20:38.541
[nun, in English]
His Holiness will join you shortly.

20:38.625 --> 20:39.708
[Bergoglio] Ah.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.125
Ah. Does the Holy Father meet
his cardinals here often?

20:43.500 --> 20:45.541
[nun] No. Uh, it's the first time.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.541
[Bergoglio chuckles] Oh, it's-- it's--
it's not raining.

20:48.625 --> 20:49.875
[nun sighs] Oh.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.833
In Rome, one never knows
what will happen next.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.708
-[both chuckle]
-[Bergoglio] Grazie.

20:55.791 --> 20:57.791
[tapping rhythmically]

21:02.458 --> 21:04.666
[man whistling]

21:16.916 --> 21:18.375
[Benedict, in Italian] Where is he?

21:23.291 --> 21:25.666
Looks like he's lived here all his life.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.166
Oregano, exactly.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.166
[sniffs]

21:29.250 --> 21:32.291
My mother swore by oregano.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.666
[sniffs]

21:34.291 --> 21:36.750
It makes everything taste good.

21:36.833 --> 21:41.416
My mom mixes it with breadcrumbs.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.500
-[Bergoglio] Me too.
-[gardener] Really?

21:43.583 --> 21:44.500
[Bergoglio] Yes!

21:44.583 --> 21:45.791
[gardener] Bravo!

21:46.208 --> 21:48.541
Everything the pope eats comes
from Gandolfo.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.166
We send it to Rome. It's all organic.

21:51.250 --> 21:52.583
Vegetables, eggs, cheese.

21:52.916 --> 21:54.250
Ah, Santo Padre. Ah.

21:54.333 --> 21:57.166
-[in Spanish] Good morning!
-[Bergoglio, in Latin] Holiness.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.875
[Benedict chuckles] Buongiorno.

22:01.250 --> 22:02.083
Ah...

22:02.583 --> 22:05.916
[in Latin] Last time we met,
we spoke Latin.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.541
[Bergoglio chuckles]

22:07.625 --> 22:09.541
[in Latin] A short meeting.

22:09.708 --> 22:13.291
I wasn't the student you were,
Holy Father.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.166
Please, not Latin.

22:16.333 --> 22:17.583
-[kisses hand]
-Ah.

22:18.833 --> 22:21.416
[in English]
Ah, Latin is useful. Especially when...

22:21.791 --> 22:23.875
I have to announce bad news to cardinals.

22:24.666 --> 22:27.000
Only 20 percent of them... become angry

22:27.083 --> 22:29.458
as only 20 percent of them know
what I have said.

22:29.791 --> 22:30.791
[Bergoglio chuckles]

22:31.000 --> 22:32.750
[Benedict]
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

22:32.833 --> 22:35.166
I know you... value punctuality.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.750
Uh, Paolo, my last assistant,

22:36.833 --> 22:39.125
he would have made sure
I got here on time.

22:39.208 --> 22:40.333
-He was, uh...
-[chuckles]

22:40.416 --> 22:43.333
-He was perfect, you know? [chuckles]
-Now he's in jail.

22:44.916 --> 22:45.750
Yeah.

22:49.708 --> 22:51.541
Would you prefer to walk?

22:51.916 --> 22:54.041
-Well, that might not be wise.
-Huh?

22:54.541 --> 22:55.916
Your shoelaces are undone.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.916
-[Bergoglio chuckles] Oh.
-[Benedict] Yeah.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.166
[Bergoglio] Um...

23:00.916 --> 23:01.833
[Benedict grunts]

23:04.375 --> 23:07.875
You wrote to me asking for permission
to retire as cardinal archbishop?

23:09.000 --> 23:09.833
Yes, uh...

23:10.458 --> 23:12.250
I have my papers here.

23:12.333 --> 23:16.291
Uh, cardinals are not required to ask
for their retirement until they're 75.

23:16.541 --> 23:17.375
Are you ill?

23:18.708 --> 23:20.250
-I have a problem with my lungs.
-[Benedict] I know,

23:20.333 --> 23:22.791
but you were born with that,
and it's not really troubled you since,

23:22.875 --> 23:23.708
has it?

23:24.458 --> 23:25.500
It's in your file.

23:25.791 --> 23:28.291
-[Bergoglio] My file?
-We keep files on everyone.

23:28.458 --> 23:30.250
So you don't have to be flattered.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.833
[Bergoglio] No, I, uh...

23:32.708 --> 23:34.166
-I'm not ill.
-[Benedict] No.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.916
In fact, you're very active.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.875
You walk everywhere
and, uh, sometimes use a bicycle.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.583
[Bergoglio] Yeah, and I tango once a week.

23:40.833 --> 23:41.958
Tango is dance?

23:42.041 --> 23:43.875
-[Bergoglio] I'm Argentinian.
-Oh.

23:43.958 --> 23:45.875
Tango and football are compulsory.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.416
Of course, yeah. You dance with someone?

23:48.541 --> 23:51.416
Uh, I-- One might look rather foolish
dancing alone.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.333
[Benedict laughs]

23:52.416 --> 23:55.833
So, for the sake of the dignity
of my office, yes, with someone.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.958
Of course, that's good. Please.

24:01.375 --> 24:05.166
-[sniffles, clicks tongue, sighs]
-Yes.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.791
You've been one of my harshest critics,

24:08.875 --> 24:11.208
and there's a lot of competition
for that title.

24:11.291 --> 24:13.250
I've never spoken out against you.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.750
No, not directly, but, um...

24:15.000 --> 24:19.041
you refuse to live in the official palace
of the cardinal archbishops.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.250
Sí, it's too grand. It's too big.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.166
Ah... [chuckles]

24:23.541 --> 24:26.208
By being so, um... pure and simple,

24:26.291 --> 24:28.958
you imply the rest of us
are not living simply enough.

24:30.125 --> 24:31.833
Can one ever...

24:32.791 --> 24:34.583
-live simply enough?
-[chuckles softly]

24:35.250 --> 24:37.250
On, uh... married priests.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.083
I was misquoted.

24:39.416 --> 24:43.458
I said, "Celibacy can be a blessing.
It can also be a curse."

24:43.541 --> 24:44.958
Yeah. And on homosexuality?

24:45.041 --> 24:46.625
All I said was--

24:46.708 --> 24:49.916
-[Benedict] No doubt, misquoted again?
-[sighs] Taken out of context.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.250
Aha... But might I suggest
you try telling the newspapers

24:53.333 --> 24:54.875
the opposite of what you think?

24:54.958 --> 24:58.208
Your chances of being quoted correctly
might, therefore, improve.

24:58.291 --> 24:59.333
[sniffles, chuckles]

25:00.416 --> 25:02.750
Another thing: you openly give sacraments

25:02.833 --> 25:04.583
to those who are out of communion.

25:04.666 --> 25:06.166
To the divorced, for instance.

25:06.500 --> 25:11.708
Oh, I believe
that giving communion is not a reward

25:11.791 --> 25:12.666
for the virtuous,

25:12.750 --> 25:14.833
it is food for the starving.

25:14.916 --> 25:15.833
Ah.

25:16.250 --> 25:18.166
So, what matters is what you believe,

25:18.250 --> 25:20.458
but not what the Church has taught
for hundreds of years?

25:20.541 --> 25:21.458
No, no, no.

25:21.541 --> 25:25.041
Mark, chapter two, verse 17,
"I came to call sinners,"

25:25.125 --> 25:27.833
as the Church has taught
for thousands of years.

25:27.916 --> 25:29.208
If we do not draw a line--

25:29.291 --> 25:30.916
Or build walls to separate...

25:31.000 --> 25:33.041
You talk about walls
as if they are bad things.

25:33.125 --> 25:35.500
-A house is built of walls. Strong walls.
-Ah...

25:35.583 --> 25:37.666
Did Jesus build walls?

25:38.083 --> 25:39.916
His face is a face of mercy.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.541
The bigger the sinner,
the warmer the welcome.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.375
Mercy is the dynamite
that blows down walls.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.333
-Yeah.
-[fly buzzes]

25:48.916 --> 25:50.791
You have an answer for everything,
don't you?

25:50.875 --> 25:52.625
[watch beeps] Don't stop now.

25:52.708 --> 25:54.916
-Keep moving.
-[Benedict] I have to walk. Let's go.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.333
[watch beeps]

25:56.416 --> 25:59.208
-Don't stop now. Keep moving.
-[Benedict] You're clever. Far too clever.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.500
[watch] Keep moving.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.333
[Benedict] You see my dilemma.

26:02.541 --> 26:04.666
You're very eloquent, you're very popular.

26:04.750 --> 26:07.333
If I allow you to resign,
it will look like a protest.

26:07.666 --> 26:09.708
The Church being attacked from all sides,

26:09.791 --> 26:12.250
why would you want to abandon her
to her enemies?

26:12.333 --> 26:15.083
Does a shepherd run away
when the wolves appear?

26:15.166 --> 26:16.666
I'm not running away.

26:17.333 --> 26:20.083
I’ll take a parish.
I’ll be a good shepherd to its people.

26:20.166 --> 26:22.666
Don't you understand?
You were almost elected pope.

26:22.958 --> 26:25.166
If you resign,
it will look like a criticism.

26:25.833 --> 26:28.583
The way you live is a criticism.
Your shoes are a criticism.

26:28.666 --> 26:30.416
You don't like my shoes? [laughs]

26:30.875 --> 26:33.875
[Benedict] Please, do not make a joke
of everything I say. Please.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.166
It is dishonest and cynical.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.000
Have enough respect to show me
your real anger.

26:40.375 --> 26:42.125
Do you think the Church is failing?

26:42.833 --> 26:45.791
-Well, we are losing people.
-And that is the fault of the Church?

26:45.875 --> 26:49.416
Not of... of... Western relativism,
or permissiveness,

26:49.500 --> 26:52.041
or what do they say now?
Oh, yes, "Anything goes."

26:54.083 --> 26:54.916
Yeah.

26:58.208 --> 27:00.041
You said the Church is narcissistic.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.583
-Or was that another misquote?
-No, no, I did say that.

27:03.250 --> 27:05.000
It seems to me that your Church--

27:05.083 --> 27:07.000
-My Church?
-[Bergoglio] Our Church...

27:07.083 --> 27:08.666
-Oh.
-...is moving in directions

27:08.750 --> 27:10.541
that I can no longer condone,

27:10.625 --> 27:12.250
or-- or not moving at all

27:12.541 --> 27:14.833
when the time demands movement.

27:14.916 --> 27:16.500
-[fly buzzes]
-[Bergoglio] Holy Father...

27:17.208 --> 27:19.083
I no longer wish to be a salesman.

27:19.250 --> 27:21.291
-A salesman?
-[Bergoglio] It's a metaphor.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.375
A salesman for a product.

27:23.458 --> 27:24.291
A product?

27:24.375 --> 27:27.041
A salesman for a product that I...
[scoffs]

27:27.666 --> 27:31.583
-I cannot, in all conscience, endorse.
-That you don't believe in?

27:32.000 --> 27:35.125
It seems to me
that we are no longer part of this world.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.750
We don't belong to it.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.041
We are not connected.

27:38.333 --> 27:39.333
[sighs]

27:40.125 --> 27:42.416
"A Church that marries
the spirit of the age--"

27:42.500 --> 27:44.416
[Bergoglio] Yes,
"...will be widowed in the next."

27:44.500 --> 27:45.791
-Yeah.
-[Bergoglio] I know.

27:45.875 --> 27:48.166
[takes a deep breath] Holy Father...

27:48.250 --> 27:50.166
When you were leader
of the Jesuits in Argentina,

27:50.250 --> 27:53.208
you had all the books on Marxism removed
from the library.

27:53.416 --> 27:56.125
And I made seminarians wear cassocks
all day,

27:56.208 --> 27:58.583
even when they were working
in the vegetable garden.

27:58.666 --> 28:01.958
And I called civil marriage
for homosexuals the Devil's plan.

28:02.041 --> 28:04.916
-[Benedict] You were not unlike me.
-No.

28:05.708 --> 28:06.541
I changed.

28:06.625 --> 28:09.041
-No, you compromised.
-[Bergoglio] No. No compromise.

28:09.125 --> 28:11.333
-No, I changed.
-Com--

28:13.125 --> 28:14.291
It's a different thing.

28:15.583 --> 28:18.458
[clicks tongue, sighs]

28:22.833 --> 28:23.875
[clicks tongue]

28:25.708 --> 28:27.250
-[grunts]
-Fath--

28:27.458 --> 28:28.625
[mutters]

28:29.833 --> 28:31.250
Change is compromise.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.500
[Bergoglio] Life...

28:35.750 --> 28:37.291
the life He gave us,

28:37.625 --> 28:38.875
is all change.

28:40.541 --> 28:42.708
You are the successor to San Pietro.

28:43.750 --> 28:45.541
San Pietro was married.

28:46.041 --> 28:48.541
Oh, thank you for letting me know.
I had no idea.

28:50.625 --> 28:54.041
We didn't ask priests to be celibate
until the 12th century.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.333
-Hm.
-Angels? [chuckles]

28:56.416 --> 28:58.583
No mention before the fifth century,

28:58.666 --> 29:00.916
and suddenly, angels are everywhere,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.458
like-- like pigeons.

29:03.458 --> 29:05.333
Nothing is static in nature

29:06.000 --> 29:07.208
or the universe,

29:07.541 --> 29:08.625
not even God.

29:09.166 --> 29:11.166
God does not change.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.625
Yes, He does.

29:12.708 --> 29:15.333
-He moves towards us.
-"I am the way, the truth, and the life."

29:15.416 --> 29:17.666
Where should we find Him
if He's always moving?

29:18.625 --> 29:19.666
On the journey?

29:19.833 --> 29:20.958
[Benedict] Oh...

29:22.250 --> 29:23.750
This is your ego talking.

29:24.750 --> 29:26.208
You think you know better.

29:26.375 --> 29:27.583
I'm Argentinian.

29:27.875 --> 29:30.208
-How does an Argentinian kill himself?
-Ah?

29:30.291 --> 29:33.458
He climbs to the top of his ego
and jumps off.

29:36.416 --> 29:37.750
[sarcastically] Ha-ha-ha!

29:44.875 --> 29:46.625
I'm not familiar
with this part of the garden.

29:46.708 --> 29:47.833
Where are we?

29:48.833 --> 29:49.750
[Bergoglio] Um...

29:50.333 --> 29:52.583
Maybe this way, where there is some shade?

29:52.875 --> 29:53.708
Oh, yeah.

29:54.666 --> 29:58.500
Perhaps we'll find God over there,
on the journey. I'll introduce you to Him.

30:00.833 --> 30:04.333
We defend 2,000 years of tradition,

30:04.416 --> 30:06.625
but Cardinal Bergoglio, he knows better.

30:06.708 --> 30:10.708
No, no. We have spent these last years
disciplining anyone

30:10.791 --> 30:13.291
who disagrees with our line on divorce,

30:13.375 --> 30:15.625
on birth control, on being gay.

30:16.416 --> 30:18.375
While our planet was being destroyed,

30:18.458 --> 30:21.416
while inequality grew like a cancer,

30:21.750 --> 30:25.166
we worried about whether it was all right
to speak the Mass in Latin,

30:25.458 --> 30:29.041
whether, uh, girls should be allowed
to be altar servers.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.333
We built walls around us,
and all the time,

30:32.625 --> 30:35.083
all the time, the real danger was inside,

30:35.166 --> 30:36.458
inside with us.

30:36.541 --> 30:38.041
[insects chirping]

30:38.375 --> 30:39.750
What are you talking about?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.708
[Bergoglio]
I think you know what I'm talking about.

30:42.833 --> 30:45.375
We knew there were priests, bishops,

30:45.458 --> 30:48.541
great men of the Church
who preyed on children.

30:48.625 --> 30:50.708
-And what did we do?
-We are addressing this.

30:50.791 --> 30:52.333
We heard their confession,

30:52.416 --> 30:56.291
then moved them on to another parish
where they could start all over again.

30:57.125 --> 31:00.208
-We believed if they confessed--
-Oh, we believed it was better

31:00.291 --> 31:02.250
if nine children suffered

31:02.333 --> 31:05.625
than if nine million lost their faith
because of a scandal?

31:05.708 --> 31:09.416
-No, of course not. That is grotesque.
-A bishop! A bishop said that to me!

31:10.083 --> 31:11.875
Uh-huh, and how did you answer him?

31:11.958 --> 31:14.458
I told him to remove the priest
from his ministry

31:15.083 --> 31:17.500
and initiate a canonical trial.
Straight away.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.833
I didn't believe a few magic words
from the priest

31:22.916 --> 31:24.541
would make everything all right again.

31:24.625 --> 31:27.083
Magic words?
Is that how you describe the sacrament?

31:27.166 --> 31:29.500
Confession cleans the sinner's soul.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.208
It does not help the victim.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.583
Sin is a... a wound,

31:35.875 --> 31:36.916
not a stain.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.708
It needs to be healed, to be treated.

31:39.791 --> 31:41.416
Forgiveness is not enough.

31:43.208 --> 31:44.041
You say "we,"

31:44.125 --> 31:46.125
-but you mean I'm the one to blame.
-[Bergoglio] No.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.208
-Holy Father. Please.
-Your protest-- Listen to me.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.125
Your resignation is a protest
against the Holy See,

31:52.208 --> 31:54.041
-and you're asking me to ratify it.
-No, no.

31:54.125 --> 31:56.958
You say you no longer wish
to be cardinal archbishop.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.791
I ask you, are you sure
you still wish to be a priest?

31:59.875 --> 32:01.458
[insects chirping loudly]

32:11.625 --> 32:13.458
I don't agree with anything you say.

32:18.625 --> 32:20.625
[insects continue chirping]

32:45.541 --> 32:47.541
-Ah, thank you.
-You're welcome.

32:48.166 --> 32:51.000
The Holy Father has retired now
until dinner.

32:51.083 --> 32:53.208
-Uh-huh.
-I'm to show you to your room.

32:53.458 --> 32:54.458
My room?

32:54.541 --> 32:55.375
Yes.

32:55.791 --> 32:56.750
Come. Please.

32:58.250 --> 32:59.083
But, uh...

33:17.875 --> 33:19.333
[Bergoglio] What about His Holiness?

33:19.666 --> 33:21.833
-[nun] The pope eats alone.
-Why?

33:21.916 --> 33:23.375
[nun] He prefers it that way.

33:23.791 --> 33:26.916
But he has arranged for you both
to eat the same meal.

33:27.000 --> 33:27.958
[Bergoglio] Ah.

33:28.041 --> 33:30.250
[nun] Just as his mother used to make it.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.375
[Bergoglio sniffs] Oh.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.625
-Huh?
-A typical Bavarian dish,

33:37.916 --> 33:39.541
Knödel mit Soße.

33:39.666 --> 33:40.666
[inhales deeply]

33:41.416 --> 33:42.250
Well...

33:44.958 --> 33:45.958
Yes, I know.

33:48.500 --> 33:51.166
[both laugh]

33:51.250 --> 33:54.250
-[engines revving on TV]
-[announcer speaking on TV]

33:59.125 --> 34:03.125
-[engines continue revving on TV]
-[announcer continues speaking on TV]

34:05.916 --> 34:08.833
After dinner, sometimes,
he comes here to relax.

34:08.958 --> 34:09.833
[Bergoglio] Oh...

34:11.208 --> 34:12.958
-It's beautiful, huh?
-[nun] Mm-hmm.

34:13.416 --> 34:14.250
Yeah.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.291
[Bergoglio] Well, Papa John.

34:18.625 --> 34:20.208
-[nun] Yeah.
-[Bergoglio sighs]

34:20.416 --> 34:21.583
[sniffs]

34:23.041 --> 34:24.333
Se posso...

34:24.416 --> 34:25.416
Certo.

34:25.583 --> 34:26.583
Sì, grazie.

34:29.583 --> 34:30.875
[reporter speaking Italian on TV]

34:30.958 --> 34:32.958
-[nun] Arrivederci, eminenza.
-Oh, grazie.

34:33.958 --> 34:36.458
[announcer speaking Italian on TV]

34:39.375 --> 34:42.166
[watch beeping, in English] Bravo.
Well done.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.333
You did 10,000 steps today.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.166
-Congratulations.
-[Benedict] Ah, my goal.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.041
My doctor gave it to me. [chuckles]

34:48.375 --> 34:52.416
He said, "You are in good shape for 86
but very bad shape for a human being."

34:53.041 --> 34:54.458
I believe this was a joke.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.333
[announcer shouts on TV]

34:56.416 --> 34:58.041
-[Benedict] No, no, please.
-No, no.

34:58.125 --> 34:59.166
-[Benedict] No, no.
-No.

34:59.250 --> 35:00.208
-[Benedict] Please.
-No.

35:00.291 --> 35:01.916
-I know you love football.
-[Bergoglio] No.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.166
-[TV clicks off]
-Oh.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.458
I've never understood
the excitement myself.

35:05.541 --> 35:08.583
Really? Not even during the World Cup?
Huh?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.583
You know, your national team and mine,
we...

35:12.166 --> 35:14.333
we could be in the final together
next year.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.875
They could be a match for Argentina.

35:16.958 --> 35:18.291
[exhales] Yeah. That's good.

35:19.791 --> 35:20.875
[smacks lips]

35:22.291 --> 35:23.166
[chuckles softly]

35:24.291 --> 35:25.125
[Benedict] Hm...

35:26.250 --> 35:28.208
Please sit. Uh.

35:29.625 --> 35:30.625
Holy Father...

35:32.000 --> 35:35.041
-I want you to look at my papers, please.
-No, no, no...

35:35.125 --> 35:37.791
-No, this is... But my papers, I really--
-No, no, no, no, no, please.

35:37.875 --> 35:38.791
[Bergoglio] Please, no,

35:38.875 --> 35:41.041
-this is the reason I'm here.
-Nein.

35:42.750 --> 35:44.791
I know you like to talk,
but I'm exhausted.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.708
-[sighs]
-[Benedict] Please, sit down.

35:46.791 --> 35:48.958
Let's just be quiet together. Please sit.

35:49.833 --> 35:50.666
Good.

35:52.958 --> 35:54.625
[both exhale]

35:55.250 --> 35:56.791
-[Benedict] Get so tired.
-Hm.

35:56.875 --> 35:57.708
[Benedict] Ah.

35:57.791 --> 35:59.708
-Would you like a tea or coffee?
-No, thank you.

35:59.791 --> 36:03.875
I find if I drink coffee
too late at night, I can't sleep.

36:04.125 --> 36:05.416
[Benedict] Hm. Me too.

36:05.750 --> 36:06.666
[Bergoglio] Hm.

36:11.083 --> 36:12.083
[sighs]

36:13.958 --> 36:14.875
Ah.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.791
[clock ticking]

36:30.458 --> 36:32.583
You know,
the hardest thing is to listen...

36:34.250 --> 36:35.500
to hear His voice.

36:38.291 --> 36:39.333
God's voice.

36:42.291 --> 36:43.708
Sorry, even for a pope?

36:44.708 --> 36:46.458
But perhaps especially for a pope.

36:47.416 --> 36:50.125
[chuckles, coughing]

36:54.000 --> 36:56.708
You know, when I was a young man,
hundreds of years ago,

36:57.500 --> 37:00.458
I always knew what He wanted of me.
What God wanted, what...

37:01.375 --> 37:02.750
purpose He had for me.

37:04.541 --> 37:05.500
But now...

37:07.750 --> 37:08.750
I don't know.

37:11.250 --> 37:14.541
[sniffles]
Perhaps I need to listen more intently.

37:14.958 --> 37:16.875
What do you think, Cardinal Bergoglio?

37:17.333 --> 37:19.416
-What? Uh, hmm...
-[Benedict grunts]

37:21.833 --> 37:22.791
[chuckles]

37:25.500 --> 37:26.333
Yeah.

37:28.125 --> 37:29.333
I think, perhaps, I need a...

37:30.375 --> 37:31.875
a spiritual hearing aid.

37:34.625 --> 37:35.625
Who does know?

37:38.083 --> 37:41.333
You know, when I first heard that voice,
whatever that was...

37:42.541 --> 37:43.875
His voice, God's voice...

37:45.375 --> 37:47.250
[smacks lips, inhales sharply]

37:47.333 --> 37:48.583
...it brought me peace.

37:50.541 --> 37:51.625
Such peace.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.791
[sniffles] Ha!

37:56.250 --> 37:57.458
You must have felt that?

37:59.625 --> 38:00.583
[takes a deep breath]

38:00.666 --> 38:02.000
[excited chatter]

38:03.875 --> 38:06.250
Hmm. The call, yes.

38:07.000 --> 38:07.875
The peace...

38:08.416 --> 38:10.291
I wouldn't call it peace.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.625
[young Bergoglio, in Spanish]
180 tickets sold.

38:11.708 --> 38:12.625
[man] Great.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.125
-[young Bergoglio] Am I free?
-Sure!

38:14.208 --> 38:15.208
[young Bergoglio] Gracias.

38:15.291 --> 38:17.250
-[man speaks Spanish]
-[young Bergoglio] Gracias.

38:18.166 --> 38:20.625
[Bergoglio, in English]
You know, the world can be chaotic.

38:20.708 --> 38:21.833
[men speaking Spanish]

38:21.916 --> 38:24.000
[Bergoglio, in English]
And there's beauty in that.

38:27.541 --> 38:30.875
Oh, I started to think
about being a priest when I was a kid.

38:31.208 --> 38:34.208
I wasn't sure, so my grandmother said,

38:34.750 --> 38:36.875
"Ask God for a sign."

38:36.958 --> 38:38.041
Hola.

38:38.125 --> 38:41.416
[both speaking Spanish]

38:41.791 --> 38:43.208
[Bergoglio, in English] I did.

38:44.166 --> 38:45.000
Nothing.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.458
[tango music playing]

39:03.125 --> 39:04.666
[Bergoglio] I felt abandoned.

39:05.833 --> 39:07.416
So, I got on with life.

39:07.916 --> 39:10.625
[speaking Spanish]

39:10.708 --> 39:12.333
[Bergoglio, in English] I had a job.

39:14.666 --> 39:16.625
-I had Amalia.
-[laughs]

39:17.875 --> 39:19.208
[in Spanish]  What are you doing?

39:19.291 --> 39:20.958
[Bergoglio, in English] I had a future.

39:21.083 --> 39:23.916
[woman, in Spanish]
Jorge, these results are the same.

39:24.416 --> 39:26.375
[young Bergoglio] Yes, same experiment.

39:26.458 --> 39:28.583
[woman] What did we agree on?

39:29.166 --> 39:30.000
Hmm?

39:30.083 --> 39:33.875
We have to test, test, and test.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.333
We live and die by facts.

39:36.833 --> 39:37.916
Facts are...

39:39.000 --> 39:40.166
You've had a haircut.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.458
[young Bergoglio] That is a fact.

39:44.458 --> 39:45.958
[woman] And that shirt is new.

39:46.666 --> 39:47.750
[chuckles softly]

39:48.416 --> 39:49.791
Also a fact.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.666
You've decided?

39:53.708 --> 39:56.125
You will propose!

39:56.958 --> 39:58.416
That's speculation.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.250
No, a deduction.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.375
[young Bergoglio] An incorrect deduction.

40:04.250 --> 40:05.833
I already asked.

40:06.583 --> 40:08.666
Tonight we'll discuss the details.

40:09.333 --> 40:11.250
So, you won't be a priest.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.458
[young Bergoglio] A logical conclusion,
Esther.

40:15.458 --> 40:16.750
What took you so long?

40:16.833 --> 40:18.333
[young Bergoglio] Bueno...

40:19.500 --> 40:20.791
I had to listen to...

40:22.625 --> 40:23.458
you know,

40:23.541 --> 40:25.291
if He had other plans for me.

40:26.000 --> 40:26.875
[Esther] He?

40:29.125 --> 40:30.625
-[young Bergoglio] He.
-Ah.

40:30.875 --> 40:34.333
This country doesn't need another priest.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.291
I'll redo the tests.

40:36.833 --> 40:39.583
-Next time, don't fool me.
-[young Bergoglio] Promise.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.250
[Esther] Jorge!

40:42.583 --> 40:44.166
You're going to be a great father.

40:44.250 --> 40:45.125
[chuckles]

40:50.791 --> 40:52.125
[woman] You're beautiful!

40:52.666 --> 40:54.083
The prettiest ones.

40:54.166 --> 40:55.875
How do I look?

40:55.958 --> 40:56.875
Very handsome!

40:56.958 --> 40:57.958
Bueno, muchas gracias.

40:58.041 --> 41:00.041
[indistinct chatter]

41:00.125 --> 41:02.125
[saxophone playing in distance]

41:15.208 --> 41:17.958
[saxophone continues playing]

41:32.250 --> 41:33.333
[distant clattering]

41:34.208 --> 41:35.166
[door squeaks]

41:47.291 --> 41:48.333
[man] Come in.

42:01.625 --> 42:02.500
Come in.

42:05.333 --> 42:06.916
No, Father, I was just passing.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.458
[priest speaking Spanish]

42:12.333 --> 42:14.000
[confessional door clicks closed]

42:17.375 --> 42:19.833
[young Bergoglio] Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

42:20.875 --> 42:22.375
[priest] I'm listening, my son.

42:22.666 --> 42:24.791
Before we start, may I ask you something?

42:26.208 --> 42:28.541
I haven’t seen you around.
Where are you from?

42:28.750 --> 42:30.583
[priest] Parque Patricios.

42:31.125 --> 42:34.125
Sometimes I come here to give Mass.

42:34.250 --> 42:37.666
I'm praying
you’re not a Huracán supporter.

42:38.583 --> 42:39.750
[chuckles]

42:39.833 --> 42:41.750
Your prayers have been answered.

42:43.625 --> 42:47.208
I live close by
in the priests’ home for the sick.

42:47.291 --> 42:48.125
[young Bergoglio] Ah.

42:48.208 --> 42:49.458
You tend to the sick.

42:50.125 --> 42:52.291
No. I'm one of them.

42:53.083 --> 42:54.125
I have cancer.

42:55.458 --> 42:56.333
Leukemia.

42:59.166 --> 43:00.958
[young Bergoglio] Then why are you here,
Father?

43:02.416 --> 43:04.333
I woke up this morning,

43:04.416 --> 43:07.250
the Lord asked me to hear confession.

43:07.375 --> 43:08.583
But no one came...

43:09.875 --> 43:11.125
until you.

43:15.166 --> 43:16.541
What is troubling you?

43:19.208 --> 43:20.333
I'm listening, son.

43:21.333 --> 43:23.125
Some time ago, I asked for a sign.

43:24.458 --> 43:25.416
[priest] Perhaps...

43:26.041 --> 43:27.666
He's giving it now.

43:30.458 --> 43:34.166
Maybe He wanted me here
to speak with you.

43:37.083 --> 43:38.458
[young Bergoglio] With me?

43:39.666 --> 43:40.666
[priest] Sí.

43:42.791 --> 43:46.291
Now you know our Father is watching.

43:47.083 --> 43:48.625
You can confess.

43:50.333 --> 43:51.791
Free your heart.

43:52.833 --> 43:54.833
[wind blowing]

44:09.791 --> 44:11.791
[silently mouthing]

44:26.208 --> 44:27.916
[bells ringing]

44:30.083 --> 44:31.875
-[priest] Bergoglio.
-Gracias.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.500
-[speaks Spanish]
-Gracias.

44:44.625 --> 44:46.458
[both continue speaking Spanish]

44:50.333 --> 44:52.083
-Bergoglio.
-[young Bergoglio] Yes.

44:52.625 --> 44:55.000
-Welcome home.
-Thank you.

44:55.083 --> 44:56.958
-How are you?
-Good.

44:57.083 --> 44:58.291
[speaks Spanish]

44:58.583 --> 45:01.083
Do you know what you're saying no to?

45:01.166 --> 45:02.666
-Yes.
-Yes?

45:02.916 --> 45:04.791
She even has a name.

45:05.375 --> 45:06.625
Oh, well.

45:07.041 --> 45:10.291
You will have to learn to love her
in another way.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.208
Hm?

45:11.291 --> 45:12.791
Love has many faces.

45:12.875 --> 45:14.291
[speaking Spanish]

45:14.750 --> 45:17.958
It's a big mistake to think
one can live without love.

45:19.083 --> 45:20.375
I still have San Lorenzo.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.875
[Bergoglio, in English] I can see now
there was never an alternative.

45:23.958 --> 45:26.625
That priest, that day,
me finding him there.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.541
[sighs] Even if I'd passed by,

45:30.250 --> 45:32.625
God would have found
another way to call me.

45:33.041 --> 45:34.666
You have such certainty.

45:35.000 --> 45:35.833
[Bergoglio] Yes.

45:36.583 --> 45:39.458
And I'm certain... He wants me to retire.

45:39.708 --> 45:40.750
[Benedict] No, please.

45:40.833 --> 45:43.000
I know we have our differences,
our disagreements,

45:43.083 --> 45:44.291
but, please, this evening,

45:44.375 --> 45:48.083
let's be... simply brothers together,
shall we?

45:49.250 --> 45:50.375
Hm? [chuckles]

45:51.833 --> 45:53.833
Do you play the piano or any instrument?

45:53.916 --> 45:55.541
No. No, but I know you do.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.375
You, uh... you made an album.

45:58.916 --> 46:01.583
Uh, Music from the Vatican: Alma Mater.

46:01.833 --> 46:05.208
That's right, I did. Heh.
Have you a copy of the album?

46:05.291 --> 46:07.583
[Bergoglio] Oh, yes, yes. Por supuesto.

46:08.625 --> 46:10.875
Ah. I could sign it for you.

46:12.458 --> 46:13.791
Yes, please.

46:15.416 --> 46:18.125
Perhaps you could play something now.

46:19.708 --> 46:22.166
Well, I--
I'm a bit out of practice, but...

46:22.958 --> 46:25.083
let's see, I'll try. [sighs]

46:25.500 --> 46:29.916
Now, this little piece by Bedřich Smetana,
my favorite Czech,

46:30.500 --> 46:32.166
and, uh, it's a lullaby.

46:32.875 --> 46:34.708
[chuckles] Let's see what I can do.

46:37.708 --> 46:39.708
[playing gentle melody]

46:41.958 --> 46:43.041
[hits wrong note]

46:43.125 --> 46:44.333
[Benedict] He lived a tragic life.

46:44.583 --> 46:45.958
-Ah.
-[Benedict] Yeah, well.

46:46.041 --> 46:47.708
Anyway, so... [clears throat]

46:50.916 --> 46:52.916
[continues playing gentle melody]

47:27.208 --> 47:29.208
[piano playing continues]

47:44.416 --> 47:45.625
[Benedict] You know, the, um...

47:46.791 --> 47:49.916
this album was recorded
in a-- a famous studio in London.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.833
[clears throat]
I was told, uh, I should be very honored

47:52.916 --> 47:54.458
because the Beatles had been there.

47:54.541 --> 47:56.208
-Do you know the Beatles?
-[Bergoglio] Yes,

47:56.291 --> 47:59.208
-I know who they are. [chuckles]
-Of course you do. [chuckles]

47:59.291 --> 48:00.750
[Bergoglio] "Eleanor Rigby."

48:00.958 --> 48:02.708
-Who?
-[Bergoglio] "Eleanor Rigby."

48:03.166 --> 48:05.458
-I don't know her.
-[Bergoglio] You know, Yellow Submarine.

48:06.291 --> 48:09.250
-[Benedict] Sorry, I don't know who she--
-The album, Yellow Submarine.

48:09.333 --> 48:10.375
[hums tune]

48:10.458 --> 48:13.166
-Yellow Submarine? That's silly.
-[both chuckle]

48:14.041 --> 48:15.666
-It's very funny.
-[Bergoglio chuckles]

48:15.750 --> 48:18.541
Um...
Yes, I-- I can't remember where the...

48:19.500 --> 48:20.750
studio was, it was a...

48:20.958 --> 48:23.000
But, uh,
it was like a church or something.

48:23.083 --> 48:24.208
[Bergoglio] Abbey Road.

48:24.583 --> 48:28.083
-Abbey, the Abbey? Yes, the road.
-Abbey Road. You went to Abbey Road?

48:28.166 --> 48:30.750
No, no, no.
It would not have been appropriate.

48:30.958 --> 48:32.958
[piano playing]

48:34.291 --> 48:35.291
[Benedict] But, you know,

48:36.041 --> 48:38.750
I once thought
I had a calling for music, but, uh...

48:38.958 --> 48:39.833
I'm afraid, um...

48:40.625 --> 48:42.458
at the keyboard, I'm not infallible.

48:42.958 --> 48:44.291
But I enjoy it.

48:56.875 --> 48:57.875
It's wonderful.

49:00.583 --> 49:03.208
[Benedict] It's an old, um...
uh, Berlin cabaret song.

49:03.291 --> 49:05.541
It was made famous on the radio
before the war

49:05.625 --> 49:08.125
-by a singer called Zarah Leander.
-[Bergoglio] Ah.

49:08.208 --> 49:10.416
[Benedict] She was very pretty.
I was a big fan of hers.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.208
-Sorry, who was?
-[Benedict] Zarah Leander.

49:12.291 --> 49:13.250

-[Bergoglio] Oh!

49:21.250 --> 49:24.958
-[Benedict] There's some.
-[Bergoglio chuckles] Ah, okay. Thank you.

The signal is not good here.

50:03.291 --> 50:07.666

My favorite program is Kommissar Rex.
[laughs]

50:27.000 --> 50:29.291
It's a television program from Austria,

50:29.375 --> 50:33.166

-[chuckles]
-[Benedict] It's very fun, oh my.

50:41.625 --> 50:43.166
It takes my mind off things.

50:43.833 --> 50:44.875
Ah.

50:45.708 --> 50:47.125
You know something, I'll tell you.

50:47.541 --> 50:50.958
Here, in this place,
they call me "God's Rottweiler,"

50:51.041 --> 50:52.458
guarding the house of God.

50:52.541 --> 50:56.041
They don't know I-- I know, but...
So I never say anything.

50:56.208 --> 51:00.791
[sighs] But it's a...
you know, it's a small pleasure.

51:00.875 --> 51:02.958
Well, small pleasures are important.

51:03.375 --> 51:05.958
-Yeah.
-[Bergoglio] You know the story, the...

51:06.541 --> 51:09.541
the two seminarians who--
who liked to smoke?

51:09.833 --> 51:11.291
No. They should resist the temp--

51:11.375 --> 51:13.458
Well, yeah, yeah. So, the first one,

51:13.750 --> 51:16.041
he goes to his spiritual director,
and he says,

51:16.375 --> 51:20.500
"Father, is it permitted to smoke
while praying?"

51:20.833 --> 51:23.583
And the director says,
"No. No, of course not."

51:23.666 --> 51:25.583
-Of course not. No, it's--
-No, no. So...

51:25.666 --> 51:27.708
So, the second one, he was a Jesuit.

51:27.791 --> 51:32.958
He says to his friend, "Brother,
you're just asking the wrong question."

51:33.041 --> 51:35.208
-Ah.
-So he goes to the director,

51:35.291 --> 51:38.250
then he says,
"Father, is it permitted to pray

51:38.958 --> 51:40.083
while smoking?"

51:41.458 --> 51:42.458
[Benedict] Yeah.

51:43.666 --> 51:45.625
Pray and smoke at the same ti--

51:47.500 --> 51:49.125
[laughs]

51:49.208 --> 51:50.416
-[Bergoglio] Ah?
-It's a joke.

51:50.500 --> 51:52.166
[both laugh]

51:52.333 --> 51:55.083
-It's a silly joke.
-[both chuckle]

51:56.333 --> 51:58.708
Pray and smoke at the same time.
It's impossible.

51:58.791 --> 52:01.583
-[continues laughing]
-[chuckles]

52:01.833 --> 52:04.000
I can never remember jokes. [sighs]

52:04.250 --> 52:07.375
Remembering jokes is an essential part
of Jesuit training.

52:07.458 --> 52:08.333

52:09.291 --> 52:10.500
Yeah.

52:12.458 --> 52:13.291
Yes.

52:14.333 --> 52:15.458

[Bergoglio] Sí, sí.

52:27.333 --> 52:28.166
Yeah.

52:30.416 --> 52:31.833
I know He's here...

52:33.375 --> 52:34.583
but He doesn't laugh.

52:35.541 --> 52:38.875
At least, I don't hear Him laughing.
You know?

52:39.541 --> 52:40.708
[chuckles softly]

52:41.583 --> 52:42.750
No, you wouldn't know.

52:44.083 --> 52:45.041

52:45.625 --> 52:48.583

Ah, good morning.

The Holy Father apologizes,
but he's been called back to Rome.

53:36.166 --> 53:37.291
Urgent business.

53:38.375 --> 53:40.583
If you can get ready as soon as possible.

53:43.625 --> 53:46.541

So, when you return home...

53:57.916 --> 53:59.000

I hope this urgent business
is not too distressing.

54:52.583 --> 54:54.208
Oh, the Curia is like a machine.

54:54.333 --> 54:56.958
You put your hand inside,
it chops it into mincemeat.

54:57.041 --> 54:58.583
They always defend themselves.

54:59.291 --> 55:02.750
Sometimes it feels like being pope is
to become breakfast.

55:03.875 --> 55:05.541
What is that plant? Is that, uh...

55:05.916 --> 55:07.625
-This?
-[Benedict] Is that basil?

55:07.708 --> 55:08.833
It's oregano.

55:09.541 --> 55:11.083
Your gardener gave it to me.

55:11.875 --> 55:14.166
Oh, yes. You're very popular.

55:14.791 --> 55:18.333
[chuckles] This popularity of yours,
is there a trick to it?

55:18.416 --> 55:20.291
I just try to be myself.

55:20.791 --> 55:21.791
[Benedict] Oh...

55:22.125 --> 55:25.500
Whenever I try to be myself,
people don't seem to like me very much.

55:26.208 --> 55:29.250
Also, there's no option,
since I'm obliged to be pope.

55:33.500 --> 55:36.208
Holy Father, about my retirement--

to finish his conversation with you,

56:23.583 --> 56:26.375
but first, he must deal
with an urgent matter.

[Bergoglio shouting]
May I know the nature of the business?

56:31.166 --> 56:34.083

at seven, okay?

[reporter on TV, in English]
The scandal at the Vatican worsened today

57:08.333 --> 57:11.125
after Gianluigi Nuzzi released
his book entitled

57:11.208 --> 57:14.750
His Holiness:
The Secret Letters of Benedict XVI.

57:14.833 --> 57:18.250
The book consists of documents, letters,
and memoranda

57:18.333 --> 57:20.500
between the pope
and his personal secretary.

57:20.875 --> 57:23.000
It has sent shock waves
through the Vatican

57:23.083 --> 57:25.000
and brought Pope Benedict back to Rome

57:25.083 --> 57:27.208
from Castel Gandolfo,

[in Italian] Holy Father, he's not there.

59:01.833 --> 59:02.750
[Benedict] Ah.

59:03.416 --> 59:04.541
What do you mean?

59:05.333 --> 59:08.333
[man] We cannot find him.
I sent a car, but he's not there.

59:10.083 --> 59:10.958
Find him!

59:19.250 --> 59:21.250
[bell ringing]

59:22.916 --> 59:25.583
[in English] I always wondered,
the uniform,

59:25.666 --> 59:27.291
it must be very uncomfortable, huh?

59:27.375 --> 59:28.291
Very hot.

59:29.666 --> 59:31.291
Difficult to keep clean. [chuckles]

59:35.208 --> 59:37.750
Or perhaps someone cleans it for you?

59:39.708 --> 59:42.333
[sighs] This is where we're meeting?

59:42.500 --> 59:44.541

I was just asked to bring you here.

1:01:07.125 --> 1:01:09.333
[Benedict]
You know, I've never been in here before.

1:01:09.416 --> 1:01:11.625
-[chuckles]
-When it was empty, I mean.

1:01:12.708 --> 1:01:13.541
No, uh...

1:01:14.666 --> 1:01:15.958
visitors, no tourists.

1:01:16.291 --> 1:01:17.916
[chuckles] I...

1:01:18.875 --> 1:01:22.333
-wanted to experience the moment with you.
-[both chuckle softly]

1:01:22.833 --> 1:01:23.708
Ah, Padre.

1:01:24.333 --> 1:01:27.291
-Yeah.
-If I was pope, I'd be in here every day.

1:01:27.541 --> 1:01:29.291
-Yeah, what else?
-What?

1:01:29.958 --> 1:01:32.500
Well, if you had been chosen,
what would you do?

1:01:32.583 --> 1:01:33.666
-Holy Father.
-[Benedict] No.

1:01:33.750 --> 1:01:35.458
This place would be different,
I think. Huh?

1:01:36.958 --> 1:01:40.666
-Well, I wouldn't eat alone, for a start.
-[Benedict] No?

1:01:40.958 --> 1:01:42.333
Aside from the theology,

1:01:42.416 --> 1:01:44.000
-it's no good for you.
-Oh.

1:01:44.166 --> 1:01:47.125
You know,
Jesus was always breaking bread

1:01:47.208 --> 1:01:49.500
-and feeding people.
-Well, what else?

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:52.000
Well, I'd, uh...

1:01:52.291 --> 1:01:53.625
I'd sort out the Bank.

1:01:53.875 --> 1:01:56.958
[chuckles] Oh, good luck with that.

1:01:57.041 --> 1:02:00.250
Yeah, well,
the banks almost destroyed my country.

1:02:00.375 --> 1:02:01.291
Yeah.

1:02:01.375 --> 1:02:03.208
You know, they beg for deregulation,

1:02:03.291 --> 1:02:05.750
like tigers begging
to be let out of a cage.

1:02:05.875 --> 1:02:08.333
-[Benedict] Yeah.
-They devour everything in sight.

1:02:08.416 --> 1:02:09.250
[Benedict] Yeah.

1:02:09.875 --> 1:02:11.041
It's new elitism.

1:02:11.125 --> 1:02:12.083
Hm.

1:02:12.958 --> 1:02:13.958
[Benedict] Yeah.

1:02:15.666 --> 1:02:18.000
You're beginning to be happy
I'm going to retire.

1:02:18.125 --> 1:02:20.750
[chuckles] You, um...

1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:24.125
For many weeks now, I've been...

1:02:25.250 --> 1:02:27.000
well, I've been praying for a sign.

1:02:28.291 --> 1:02:29.541
I don't understand.

1:02:31.541 --> 1:02:33.250
[sighs] Well, when your...

1:02:34.916 --> 1:02:38.000
when your request came to me
to retire as cardinal archbishop,

1:02:38.083 --> 1:02:40.083
I could not accept it, your retirement,

1:02:40.166 --> 1:02:41.666
I mean, until I'd, um...

1:02:42.750 --> 1:02:43.750
spoken to you.

1:02:44.958 --> 1:02:48.000
So, you had to come from Argentina to Rome
to see me.

1:02:48.666 --> 1:02:49.666
And, uh...

1:02:50.291 --> 1:02:51.375
what I'm saying is,

1:02:51.458 --> 1:02:53.625
perhaps you had to come here
for some other purpose.

1:02:54.083 --> 1:02:55.083
Like what?

1:02:56.208 --> 1:02:57.041
Well...

1:02:59.375 --> 1:03:00.541
you see, I've made a...

1:03:01.416 --> 1:03:03.541
a decision, an important decision,
I think,

1:03:03.625 --> 1:03:05.875
for the life of the Church
and for her future.

1:03:06.541 --> 1:03:09.500
Something I ask you to hide in your soul
and speak of to no one.

1:03:09.583 --> 1:03:10.916
-Uh-huh.
-Know what I mean?

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:11.916
-Sí.
-Good.

1:03:14.416 --> 1:03:15.708
You know, sometimes...

1:03:17.791 --> 1:03:20.583
sometimes, you notice little things.
It's very strange.

1:03:25.250 --> 1:03:28.375
You know, the other night,
after... prayer,

1:03:28.833 --> 1:03:30.458
I put out the candle, and uh...

1:03:33.958 --> 1:03:35.208
instead of rising up...

1:03:36.458 --> 1:03:37.541
the smoke went down,

1:03:38.583 --> 1:03:40.291
like Cain's offering being rejected

1:03:40.375 --> 1:03:41.541
-by God.
-[Bergoglio chuckles]

1:03:42.166 --> 1:03:43.500
Do you notice such things?

1:03:45.583 --> 1:03:46.458
Uh...

1:03:47.166 --> 1:03:52.416
I bought my ticket for my flight here...
[chuckles]

1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:54.791
...before you requested my presence.

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:57.500
-No.
-Yes!

1:03:57.583 --> 1:03:59.958
-Your plane ticket, you bought it before?
-[Bergoglio] Yeah.

1:04:01.041 --> 1:04:02.000
[chuckles]

1:04:02.583 --> 1:04:05.083
[Benedict]
Well, that gives me great encouragement.

1:04:07.458 --> 1:04:08.291
Yeah...

1:04:09.916 --> 1:04:12.208
You're the right person.
I'm going to resign.

1:04:12.291 --> 1:04:13.666
-This marble is cold here.
-Sorry...

1:04:13.750 --> 1:04:16.333
-[stammers] ...the right person for what?
-To tell.

1:04:17.375 --> 1:04:18.375
To tell what?

1:04:18.875 --> 1:04:20.916
What I just said. I'm going to resign.

1:04:22.375 --> 1:04:24.041
Uh, resign from what?

1:04:24.416 --> 1:04:26.166
[chuckles] The Papacy.

1:04:26.375 --> 1:04:27.625
The Chair of Saint Peter.

1:04:27.958 --> 1:04:29.208
The Bishopric of Rome.

1:04:29.291 --> 1:04:32.291
I'm going to renounce all of them.
[grunts]

1:04:35.125 --> 1:04:38.125
[Bergoglio] But you can't. You... You...
[clears throat]

1:04:38.416 --> 1:04:40.833
-You wouldn't be the pope anymore.
-[Benedict] No.

1:04:43.250 --> 1:04:44.291
Popes can't resign!

1:04:44.791 --> 1:04:46.208
It's not without precedent.

1:04:47.041 --> 1:04:50.000
Celestine V resigned, 1294.

1:04:50.583 --> 1:04:51.666
Didn't you know that?

1:04:52.250 --> 1:04:54.708
Holy Father, you think--
you think people will not be shocked

1:04:54.791 --> 1:04:58.208
because this happened
once before, 700 years ago?

1:04:58.291 --> 1:04:59.750
[Benedict chuckles] Well...

1:05:00.750 --> 1:05:03.708
I-- I came here just to have you sign
a piece of paper.

1:05:03.791 --> 1:05:04.666
[Benedict] I know.

1:05:05.166 --> 1:05:07.833
[groans, sighs]

1:05:08.833 --> 1:05:11.750
Now you know why I could not grant you
your wish to retire.

1:05:11.833 --> 1:05:14.458
It would be another conclave.
It is important that you're there.

1:05:14.541 --> 1:05:17.250
Holy Father, you must not do this.
You cannot do this.

1:05:17.333 --> 1:05:19.000
-[Benedict] Why not?
-[sighs]

1:05:19.458 --> 1:05:23.875
Why do the presidents of America
and Russia and China come to you?

1:05:23.958 --> 1:05:24.958
Because...

1:05:25.791 --> 1:05:27.041
unlike them,

1:05:27.125 --> 1:05:30.833
your authority comes from the fact
that you will suffer and die

1:05:30.916 --> 1:05:32.208
in the job.

1:05:33.125 --> 1:05:34.250
-Yeah.
-[Bergoglio] A martyr

1:05:34.333 --> 1:05:35.541
to justice and truth.

1:05:35.916 --> 1:05:37.333
For this, all people come.

1:05:37.416 --> 1:05:38.708
Forgive me, but...

1:05:42.208 --> 1:05:43.041
But?

1:05:43.583 --> 1:05:46.666
Christ did not come down from the cross.

1:05:46.791 --> 1:05:49.791
Ah! God always grants you the right words.

1:05:49.875 --> 1:05:52.333
[Bergoglio] No, no.
No, a pope must go on forever.

1:05:52.416 --> 1:05:55.541
Be the personification
of the crucified Christ.

1:05:57.125 --> 1:05:59.708
If you do this,
you will damage the Papacy forever.

1:05:59.791 --> 1:06:01.166
[Benedict tuts] Well...

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:04.916
And what damage will I do if I remain?

1:06:08.333 --> 1:06:10.708
[sighs] I...

1:06:12.083 --> 1:06:14.250
It's-- It's... two popes?

1:06:14.625 --> 1:06:17.208
-[Benedict] Well, in 19--
-No. It is-- No, it's unthinkable.

1:06:17.291 --> 1:06:19.041
Well, in 1978, we had three popes.

1:06:19.125 --> 1:06:21.125
[Bergoglio] Yeah,
but they weren't at the same time.

1:06:21.208 --> 1:06:22.791
I was making a little joke.

1:06:23.125 --> 1:06:24.083
[Bergoglio] A joke?

1:06:24.166 --> 1:06:26.541
A German joke.
It doesn't have to be funny.

1:06:27.541 --> 1:06:28.416
[scoffs]

1:06:29.125 --> 1:06:32.416
[Benedict] You know, there's a saying,
uh, "God always...

1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:34.916
corrects one pope by presenting the world
with another pope."

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.166
I should... I'd like to see my correction.

1:06:39.583 --> 1:06:41.916
[takes a deep breath]
Both commanding authority.

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:42.833
[Benedict] No.

1:06:43.083 --> 1:06:44.958
Only one would command authority.

1:06:45.208 --> 1:06:47.458
I would, uh,
hide away, out of the spotlight.

1:06:47.958 --> 1:06:50.000
[in Latin] Silence incarnate!

1:06:51.166 --> 1:06:52.083
[chuckles]

1:06:52.166 --> 1:06:54.583
[in English]
Are you being pressured to go? The Curia?

1:06:54.833 --> 1:06:55.750
No, no, no.

1:06:55.916 --> 1:06:58.333
If there was pressure from there,
I would resist.

1:06:58.750 --> 1:07:01.166
No, I know my intentions
and my motives are pure.

1:07:02.666 --> 1:07:05.958
-See, I'm a scholar, not a manager.
-[watch beeps] Don't stop now.

1:07:06.041 --> 1:07:07.125
-Keep moving.
-Yeah.

1:07:07.208 --> 1:07:08.750
[watch beeping] Keep moving.

1:07:08.833 --> 1:07:10.125
And besides, I, um...

1:07:10.208 --> 1:07:11.375
[watch] Don't stop now.

1:07:11.458 --> 1:07:15.375
-I have a pacemaker, and I'm half-blind.
-[watch] Keep moving.

1:07:15.458 --> 1:07:19.958
[chuckles]
I can no longer see out of my left eye.

1:07:20.791 --> 1:07:21.791
And, uh...

1:07:22.708 --> 1:07:24.875
governance requires eyes
that I do not have.

1:07:25.833 --> 1:07:26.666
Yes...

1:07:28.208 --> 1:07:30.166
I've struggled and fought to do what...

1:07:31.125 --> 1:07:34.458
must be done, but, um... [clicks tongue]

1:07:36.041 --> 1:07:37.750
-I've lost.
-[sighs]

1:07:38.083 --> 1:07:41.291
It is our weakness
that calls forth the grace of God.

1:07:41.833 --> 1:07:44.625
You show your weakness,
He gives us strength.

1:07:44.958 --> 1:07:45.791
[Benedict] Yeah.

1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:48.333
I've given you my answer.

1:07:48.750 --> 1:07:49.750
Be satisfied.

1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:52.166
With respect, Holy Father...

1:07:53.166 --> 1:07:55.875
it's not me who needs to be satisfied.

1:07:56.125 --> 1:07:59.416
It's 1.2 billion believers.

1:07:59.833 --> 1:08:01.083
They'll need to know why.

1:08:01.291 --> 1:08:04.708
Otherwise, they'll think
there is a scandal, a... a plot.

1:08:05.458 --> 1:08:07.250
Well,
that is the calculation of leadership.

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:09.750
-[sighs]
-A calculation we must both make.

1:08:10.958 --> 1:08:12.208
Both? Why?

1:08:12.583 --> 1:08:16.375
Well, for months,
I've been, uh, wanting to resign,

1:08:16.458 --> 1:08:19.125
but there was one thought
that prevented me from that.

1:08:19.208 --> 1:08:21.541
I thought, "What if at the next conclave,

1:08:21.791 --> 1:08:24.833
they voted for that, uh,
Cardinal Bergoglio?"

1:08:24.916 --> 1:08:25.875
For you.

1:08:26.291 --> 1:08:28.000
[Bergoglio]
Then I offered my resignation.

1:08:28.083 --> 1:08:28.916
[Benedict] Exactly.

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.375
[chuckles] I was delighted.

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:32.041
As I said...

1:08:32.750 --> 1:08:34.625
what prevented me from resigning

1:08:34.708 --> 1:08:36.000
was the thought that, uh,

1:08:36.583 --> 1:08:39.041
they could've chosen you, or elected you.

1:08:39.875 --> 1:08:42.333
But now you are here in Rome to see me,

1:08:42.916 --> 1:08:44.958
-and now, I've changed.
-You've compromised.

1:08:45.041 --> 1:08:46.250
No, I've changed.

1:08:47.125 --> 1:08:48.583
Compromise is something else.

1:08:49.916 --> 1:08:53.458
Your style and your methods
are entirely different to mine.

1:08:53.708 --> 1:08:55.041
I don't agree with any--

1:08:55.125 --> 1:08:58.000
well, most of the things you say,
think, or do, but, uh...

1:08:58.250 --> 1:09:00.833
for some strange reason,

1:09:01.541 --> 1:09:02.666
now I can see a...

1:09:04.583 --> 1:09:06.416
a necessity for a Bergoglio.

1:09:07.541 --> 1:09:10.625
But I cannot do this without knowing
that there is, at least,

1:09:10.708 --> 1:09:12.833
-a possibility that you might be chosen.
-No.

1:09:14.750 --> 1:09:16.541
It could never be me.

1:09:16.625 --> 1:09:17.458
All right.

1:09:17.541 --> 1:09:19.125
-We are at an impasse.
-[sighs]

1:09:19.208 --> 1:09:22.583
You cannot retire from the Church
unless I agree to your going,

1:09:22.791 --> 1:09:25.208
and I cannot resign
until you agree to stay.

1:09:26.125 --> 1:09:28.041
It's a conundrum. A theological conundrum.

1:09:28.125 --> 1:09:30.583
You don't understand.
It could never be me.

1:09:30.666 --> 1:09:33.041
We know in our heart of hearts
that it could be.

1:09:33.166 --> 1:09:36.041
The Church needs to change,
and you could be that change.

1:09:36.125 --> 1:09:39.833
[sighs] Oh. No. No, uh...
Not me. Never.

1:09:39.916 --> 1:09:41.750
-It couldn't be me.
-[Benedict] Why not?

1:09:42.166 --> 1:09:43.166
[sighs, chuckles]

1:09:43.625 --> 1:09:45.625
[footsteps approaching]

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:51.500
You know why.

1:09:52.583 --> 1:09:53.875
I've read your files.

1:09:54.375 --> 1:09:55.416
[clicks tongue] No.

1:09:56.666 --> 1:09:59.208
The files... are incomplete.

1:09:59.625 --> 1:10:00.833
[Benedict] How incomplete?

1:10:00.916 --> 1:10:01.833
[siren wailing]

1:10:02.125 --> 1:10:04.916
[Jorge Videla, in Spanish]
People of Argentina:

1:10:06.958 --> 1:10:11.833
The country faces a hard moment
in its history...

1:10:12.166 --> 1:10:13.708
[Bergoglio, in English] In the '70s,

1:10:13.833 --> 1:10:17.333
the government was overthrown
by a military dictatorship.

1:10:17.791 --> 1:10:21.500
At that time, I became the head
of Jesuit priests in Argentina.

1:10:22.250 --> 1:10:23.583
[in Spanish] I remarried.

1:10:23.666 --> 1:10:25.833
[young Bergoglio] In other words,
you live with someone.

1:10:27.666 --> 1:10:29.875
[Bergoglio, in English]
Everybody was a suspect.

1:10:29.958 --> 1:10:31.416
[indistinct distant shouting]

1:10:31.500 --> 1:10:33.500
[soldiers speaking Spanish]

1:10:35.791 --> 1:10:38.625
-[man speaking Spanish on radio]
-[men shouting in Spanish]

1:10:38.708 --> 1:10:40.958
[Bergoglio, in English]
Thirty thousand people were killed.

1:10:41.041 --> 1:10:44.000
-[in Spanish] What happened?
-We want our children. Where are they?

1:10:44.083 --> 1:10:47.166
[Bergoglio, in English]
Anyone who disagreed disappeared.

1:10:47.833 --> 1:10:49.583
Esther, my old boss.

1:10:50.333 --> 1:10:51.333
My friend.

1:10:52.291 --> 1:10:53.625
Her daughter was among them.

1:10:53.708 --> 1:10:54.708
[man speaking on radio]

1:10:54.791 --> 1:10:59.125
[in Spanish] We Argentinians say
there are thousands and thousands...

1:10:59.208 --> 1:11:04.291
of mothers and families suffering
in pain, anguish, and despair.

1:11:04.375 --> 1:11:07.041
We don't know where our children are!

1:11:07.125 --> 1:11:08.583
[officer] They say you lie.

1:11:08.666 --> 1:11:09.958
We are lying?

1:11:10.375 --> 1:11:13.291
That our children disappeared?

1:11:13.666 --> 1:11:15.291
Where are they?

1:11:15.375 --> 1:11:16.208
Cowards!

1:11:16.666 --> 1:11:19.958
The so-called Christian Army have them!

1:11:20.583 --> 1:11:22.333
[crowd chanting]

1:11:22.416 --> 1:11:23.958
[Bergoglio, in English]
Many priests were seen

1:11:24.041 --> 1:11:26.375
as supporters of the armed resistance.

1:11:26.458 --> 1:11:28.333
[in Spanish] ...neither oppressors
nor oppressed.

1:11:28.416 --> 1:11:29.250
[group] Amen.

1:11:29.333 --> 1:11:31.000
[men speaking Spanish]

1:11:31.083 --> 1:11:34.541
[Bergoglio, in English] Father Mugica,
the voice of the poor in Argentina...

1:11:34.625 --> 1:11:35.458
[rapid gunfire]

1:11:35.541 --> 1:11:38.250
...was martyred in 1974.

1:11:38.333 --> 1:11:40.333
-[men shouting]
-[Bergoglio] After him...

1:11:40.416 --> 1:11:43.625
-[gunshot]
-...many priests and nuns were killed.

1:11:43.708 --> 1:11:45.750
[man speaking Spanish on radio]

1:11:47.291 --> 1:11:48.291
[gunshot]

1:11:48.750 --> 1:11:50.541
[tires screech in distance]

1:11:52.041 --> 1:11:55.333
[sighs, in English]
This is not a time I'm proud of, Father.

1:11:56.625 --> 1:11:59.416
I felt my job was to make sure
my priests were safe.

1:11:59.750 --> 1:12:03.125
-[officer speaking Spanish]
-[crowd replies in Spanish]

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:05.458
[in Spanish] Father.

1:12:05.541 --> 1:12:07.000
[Bergoglio, in English]
And I spoke with Massera,

1:12:07.083 --> 1:12:09.291
one of the leaders of the junta.

1:12:11.083 --> 1:12:14.250
-Tried to reason with him.
-[man, in Spanish] Admiral.

1:12:15.041 --> 1:12:16.666
[in English] To compromise.

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:19.458
[man, in Spanish] Father Bergoglio,
from the seminary.

1:12:19.541 --> 1:12:21.916
-[Massera] The seminary?
-[young Bergoglio] Nice to meet you.

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.625
[Massera] Where Jesuits become Marxists
through books.

1:12:26.666 --> 1:12:29.375
-He is with us and got rid of the books.
-Hm.

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:33.416
Maybe a priest took them to a mission.

1:12:35.083 --> 1:12:37.291
[laughs] It is a joke.

1:12:37.375 --> 1:12:38.750
My chaplain is a Jesuit.

1:12:39.291 --> 1:12:40.708
I'm listening, Bergoglio.

1:12:40.791 --> 1:12:44.000
Hélder Câmara, Church and Development.

1:12:44.083 --> 1:12:46.333
Yankee Imperialism in Latin America,
Olivares.

1:12:46.416 --> 1:12:47.666
[doorbell rings]

1:12:48.625 --> 1:12:50.291
-[Esther] Hola, Jorge.
-[kiss]

1:12:51.291 --> 1:12:53.666
[Esther] I didn't understand the call.
What's happening?

1:12:53.750 --> 1:12:56.791
They are watching you, Esther.
We need to clear the house.

1:12:58.291 --> 1:12:59.291
Books,

1:13:00.375 --> 1:13:01.541
pamphlets...

1:13:01.625 --> 1:13:02.500
All of it.

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:05.583
Why the urgency?

1:13:05.666 --> 1:13:06.708
[young Bergoglio] Gramsci.

1:13:06.791 --> 1:13:08.541
The Working Class. Peronism.

1:13:08.833 --> 1:13:10.208
Brecht. Marx.

1:13:10.375 --> 1:13:11.666
Psychoanalysis.

1:13:12.666 --> 1:13:15.041
How do you know they're watching?

1:13:16.875 --> 1:13:18.208
Who are you talking to?

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:21.666
[young Bergoglio speaking Spanish]

1:13:22.625 --> 1:13:24.875
See this guy protesting with you?

1:13:25.333 --> 1:13:26.458
Gustavo.

1:13:26.875 --> 1:13:27.708
No.

1:13:28.833 --> 1:13:30.208
His name is Astiz.

1:13:31.791 --> 1:13:34.208
Personal friend of Admiral Massera.

1:13:35.791 --> 1:13:38.041
Otherwise known
as the "Blond Angel of Death."

1:13:39.250 --> 1:13:40.666
An informer.

1:13:41.916 --> 1:13:44.083
He’s a son of a bitch.

1:13:44.166 --> 1:13:45.000
[speaking Spanish]

1:13:49.250 --> 1:13:50.500
[speaking Spanish]

1:13:55.833 --> 1:13:57.791
How long will you stay quiet?

1:14:00.041 --> 1:14:01.291
Why don't you speak out?

1:14:02.416 --> 1:14:04.500
Why don’t you speak out?

1:14:05.208 --> 1:14:07.041
[young Bergoglio] If I speak,
I can't help.

1:14:07.125 --> 1:14:09.916
No. If you spoke,
you would be one more, like us.

1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:13.250
You like to be the one
in the admiral's palace...

1:14:13.541 --> 1:14:14.541
making contacts.

1:14:15.125 --> 1:14:16.041
Right?

1:14:20.708 --> 1:14:24.041
[Bergoglio, in English] In this moment,
she looked at me like I was a stranger.

1:14:28.166 --> 1:14:29.333
[car engine starts]

1:14:32.583 --> 1:14:33.875
[Bergoglio] With fear.

1:14:37.458 --> 1:14:39.833
That was the last time I ever saw her.

1:14:42.375 --> 1:14:43.708
She warned me,

1:14:43.791 --> 1:14:45.416
-and I didn't listen.
-[man shouting]

1:14:45.500 --> 1:14:48.083
-[men speaking Spanish]
-[Bergoglio, in English] Had I listened,

1:14:48.166 --> 1:14:50.375
I would not have made
the mistakes that I made.

1:14:50.458 --> 1:14:52.458
[all speaking Spanish]

1:14:55.208 --> 1:14:56.458
[Jalics, in Spanish] I was his teacher.

1:14:56.541 --> 1:14:59.083
Now he's head of the Jesuits
in Argentina.

1:14:59.500 --> 1:15:01.125
And Uruguay.

1:15:01.208 --> 1:15:03.541
These are the guys learning skills.

1:15:03.666 --> 1:15:05.833
Come meet the boys I mentioned.

1:15:05.916 --> 1:15:06.875
[speaking Spanish]

1:15:06.958 --> 1:15:08.500
[Jalics] They're real artists!

1:15:08.625 --> 1:15:09.916
[young Bergoglio] Jalics!

1:15:11.125 --> 1:15:13.083
You need to close down Rivadavia.

1:15:13.958 --> 1:15:14.958
[scoffs]

1:15:16.666 --> 1:15:17.541
What?

1:15:17.625 --> 1:15:19.583
I need you to close this mission.

1:15:21.958 --> 1:15:22.833
[Jalics] Yorio!

1:15:23.916 --> 1:15:26.000
We didn't build this for nothing.

1:15:26.083 --> 1:15:27.541
We can't abandon people.

1:15:27.625 --> 1:15:31.583
With Massera,
if we haven't lost a Jesuit--

1:15:31.666 --> 1:15:33.750
It's because you didn’t speak out.

1:15:34.833 --> 1:15:37.083
And made us irrelevant.

1:15:41.291 --> 1:15:42.916
They’re watching...

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.916
and don’t like what they see.

1:15:45.208 --> 1:15:47.041
I know!

1:15:49.708 --> 1:15:51.875
-[Yorio] How?
-[young Bergoglio] What?

1:15:52.958 --> 1:15:55.541
How do you know that, Jorge?

1:15:58.125 --> 1:16:00.125
[Jalics]
Did you go to President Videla's house?

1:16:01.833 --> 1:16:03.250
To give communion?

1:16:07.041 --> 1:16:08.541
They are assassins, Jorge.

1:16:15.166 --> 1:16:16.875
My role is to protect the Order.

1:16:17.666 --> 1:16:18.791
[Yorio] Ah.

1:16:18.875 --> 1:16:21.708
That's our calling now?
To protect ourselves?

1:16:22.583 --> 1:16:24.625
[Jalics] I taught you...

1:16:25.333 --> 1:16:26.958
How do we know Christ?

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:28.416
By following in His footsteps.

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:30.041
Where do they lead?

1:16:30.125 --> 1:16:30.958
Here.

1:16:31.041 --> 1:16:33.250
[young Bergoglio]
Or before a firing squad!

1:16:33.333 --> 1:16:35.166
If that's so, so be it!

1:16:37.041 --> 1:16:38.958
[young Bergoglio] I'm your superior.

1:16:39.291 --> 1:16:42.541
I'm begging you to return to the seminary!

1:16:43.125 --> 1:16:44.416
If we don't obey?

1:16:45.583 --> 1:16:48.125
[young Bergoglio]
You are Jesuits. You made vows!

1:16:49.416 --> 1:16:51.750
Break them, and you're no longer Jesuits!

1:16:51.833 --> 1:16:54.666
If we aren’t Jesuits, we lose protection.

1:16:55.458 --> 1:16:57.375
It's like a death sentence.

1:16:57.458 --> 1:16:59.916
So keep your vows. Damn it!

1:17:01.083 --> 1:17:03.458
We refuse to cease our work.

1:17:04.416 --> 1:17:06.458
You keep drinking tea with killers.

1:17:08.083 --> 1:17:10.083
Listen to me!

1:17:10.166 --> 1:17:12.625
I'll talk to whoever helps me save lives.

1:17:12.875 --> 1:17:13.750
Mm-hmm.

1:17:13.833 --> 1:17:17.708
And you obey. Shut down the project!

1:17:17.791 --> 1:17:18.791
[chuckles]

1:17:18.875 --> 1:17:20.041
It is an order.

1:17:20.583 --> 1:17:21.541
[sighs]

1:17:22.791 --> 1:17:25.250
You hear? It's an order!

1:17:27.250 --> 1:17:29.583
[Bergoglio, in English]
But they disobeyed my orders.

1:17:30.958 --> 1:17:32.875
Questioned my authority.

1:17:40.958 --> 1:17:44.625
You talk about, uh... your authority.
What did you do with that authority?

1:17:44.875 --> 1:17:46.083
[speaks indistinctly]

1:17:48.416 --> 1:17:50.958
[Benedict]
You used it to save dozens of lives.

1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:52.500
It's in your file.

1:17:52.916 --> 1:17:55.000
[in Spanish] I brought you some food...

1:17:55.083 --> 1:17:57.458
[Benedict, in English]
And you hid families of trade unionists

1:17:57.541 --> 1:17:58.666
in the seminary.

1:17:59.041 --> 1:18:02.000
You even drove some of them
up to the border yourself.

1:18:02.083 --> 1:18:03.791
[stammers] It wasn't enough.

1:18:04.375 --> 1:18:07.083
No. No, not for your...

1:18:08.041 --> 1:18:10.250
brother Jesuits, no.

1:18:10.791 --> 1:18:12.416
[young Bergoglio in Spanish]
It's an order!

1:18:14.166 --> 1:18:17.291
[Bergoglio, in English] Pride...
obscured my judgment.

1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:21.708
Their right to say Mass was removed.

1:18:21.916 --> 1:18:24.625
And with it, the protection of the Church.

1:18:28.875 --> 1:18:30.958
I was supposed to protect them.

1:18:31.500 --> 1:18:32.416
I failed.

1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:34.500
[engines revving]

1:18:37.916 --> 1:18:39.416
[men shouting]

1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:40.833
[horn honks]

1:18:56.125 --> 1:18:57.250
[soldiers shout]

1:19:00.208 --> 1:19:01.750
[Jalics, in Spanish] Go home!

1:19:01.833 --> 1:19:03.291
-[whistle blows]
-[indistinct chatter]

1:19:05.666 --> 1:19:08.666
[soldier] The Mass is over.
Who's the priest?

1:19:09.583 --> 1:19:10.708
Keep cool.

1:19:11.666 --> 1:19:13.750
Gentlemen, calm down, please.

1:19:13.833 --> 1:19:15.166
[parishioners scream]

1:19:15.958 --> 1:19:17.500
[Jalics pleads in Spanish]

1:19:19.250 --> 1:19:21.250
[indistinct shouting]

1:19:35.291 --> 1:19:38.208
Yorio! [shouting in Spanish]

1:19:45.875 --> 1:19:49.500
[Bergoglio, in English] It's not easy
to entrust oneself to God's mercy.

1:19:50.083 --> 1:19:54.875
I know He has a very special capacity
for forgetting our mistakes.

1:19:55.666 --> 1:19:56.791
God forgets,

1:19:57.208 --> 1:19:58.208
but I don't.

1:19:58.541 --> 1:20:00.541
[indistinct shouting]

1:20:04.833 --> 1:20:07.375
They were taken away
and tortured for months.

1:20:09.416 --> 1:20:11.000
Their hands were broken.

1:20:11.125 --> 1:20:13.125
[footsteps echoing]

1:20:15.333 --> 1:20:16.333
[man speaking Spanish]

1:20:16.416 --> 1:20:17.333
[in Spanish] Admiral.

1:20:17.750 --> 1:20:18.583
The priest.

1:20:19.666 --> 1:20:20.791
Come in.

1:20:25.083 --> 1:20:26.208
[door closes]

1:20:28.708 --> 1:20:29.583
Bergoglio.

1:20:30.875 --> 1:20:32.166
[young Bergoglio] Admiral.

1:20:32.250 --> 1:20:33.291
I'm listening.

1:20:34.333 --> 1:20:37.250
-You have my priests--
-Vilas serves.

1:20:38.041 --> 1:20:39.166
[Vilas grunts on TV]

1:20:40.541 --> 1:20:42.166
[Massera] He is good, right?

1:20:43.458 --> 1:20:44.708
Admiral,

1:20:45.375 --> 1:20:48.875
you have my priests Jalics and Yorio...

1:20:48.958 --> 1:20:50.458
detained.

1:20:50.541 --> 1:20:53.291
They are not political.

1:20:53.708 --> 1:20:55.125
[Massera] Why did you kick them out?

1:20:55.208 --> 1:20:57.916
They were temporarily suspended.

1:20:58.000 --> 1:20:59.875
A technical matter.

1:21:00.208 --> 1:21:01.750
Who told you?

1:21:01.833 --> 1:21:03.708
We see and hear everything.

1:21:04.250 --> 1:21:05.958
[young Bergoglio] Four months.

1:21:06.125 --> 1:21:07.416
What are you doing to them?

1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:08.791
[Massera] Enough, Bergoglio!

1:21:08.875 --> 1:21:11.666
I know full well where my priests are!

1:21:11.750 --> 1:21:13.458
They're not your priests.

1:21:13.958 --> 1:21:15.375
You just said so.

1:21:16.625 --> 1:21:18.083
It's a "technical matter."

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.125
-[announcer, in English] That's in!
-[crowd applauds]

1:21:21.208 --> 1:21:25.125
[in Spanish] You should think
before you act.

1:21:28.958 --> 1:21:31.125
[in English] My words had no impact.

1:21:32.166 --> 1:21:33.291
It was empty.

1:21:34.333 --> 1:21:36.250
[Benedict] But you did all you could.

1:21:36.416 --> 1:21:38.416
[indistinct chatter]

1:21:41.375 --> 1:21:45.250
-It wasn't enough.
-[Benedict] All dictatorships...

1:21:46.166 --> 1:21:48.250
take away our freedom to choose.

1:21:48.541 --> 1:21:49.625
We both know that.

1:21:49.833 --> 1:21:52.208
[Bergoglio] Or reveal our own weaknesses.

1:21:52.291 --> 1:21:55.833
[football announcer shouting excitedly
in Spanish on radio]

1:22:04.125 --> 1:22:05.458

1:22:08.291 --> 1:22:10.041
[panting and whimpering]

1:22:10.583 --> 1:22:13.208
[Bergoglio] And then, they took Esther.

1:22:15.458 --> 1:22:18.333
There were so many bodies
washed up on the shore,

1:22:18.416 --> 1:22:20.875
the Coast Guard complained
they couldn't cope. [sighs]

1:22:20.958 --> 1:22:22.958
[wind howling]

1:22:37.458 --> 1:22:38.500
My dear friend...

1:22:41.625 --> 1:22:42.625
And where was I?

1:22:46.750 --> 1:22:48.416
Where was Christ in all this?

1:22:49.750 --> 1:22:52.541
Was he taking tea
in the presidential palace?

1:22:53.958 --> 1:22:56.083
Or was he being tortured in prisons,

1:22:56.791 --> 1:22:58.291
with Yorio and Jalics?

1:22:58.958 --> 1:22:59.791
[Benedict] Hm.

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:03.958
Well, perhaps the path appears straight
when we...

1:23:04.541 --> 1:23:05.500
look back at it.

1:23:07.541 --> 1:23:09.625
On the way, we often feel lost.

1:23:12.541 --> 1:23:15.250
The dark night of the soul. Hm.

1:23:18.375 --> 1:23:19.291
Hm.

1:23:20.041 --> 1:23:21.666
[man speaking Spanish on radio]

1:23:21.750 --> 1:23:23.833
[Benedict, in English]
After the dictatorship fell

1:23:23.916 --> 1:23:25.125
and democracy returned,

1:23:25.250 --> 1:23:26.583
your order turned on you.

1:23:27.375 --> 1:23:28.458
[priest speaking Spanish]

1:23:29.666 --> 1:23:31.708
[Benedict, in English]
You were cast out of office,

1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:33.958
removed from your position,

1:23:34.916 --> 1:23:36.666
stripped of all authority,

1:23:36.750 --> 1:23:37.958
sent abroad.

[Raúl Alfonsín speaking Spanish
on broadcast]

1:23:46.250 --> 1:23:48.291
[crowds cheering]

1:23:49.125 --> 1:23:51.958
[Julio César Strassera speaking Spanish
on radio]

1:23:56.541 --> 1:24:00.333
[Benedict] They accused you
of hard-line views, of being right-wing,

1:24:00.708 --> 1:24:02.916
of having sinned by doing too little,

1:24:03.500 --> 1:24:05.166
of being egotistical.

1:24:06.166 --> 1:24:07.833
You were sent to the mountains,

1:24:08.541 --> 1:24:09.375
exiled.

1:24:12.458 --> 1:24:16.666
[man, in Spanish] God bless this food...

1:24:17.541 --> 1:24:20.708
[praying in Spanish]

1:24:27.750 --> 1:24:30.000
[Bergoglio, in English]
Two years of introspection,

1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:31.916
of dark days and nights.

1:24:33.125 --> 1:24:35.250
[Benedict] Of interior crisis.

1:24:35.333 --> 1:24:37.166
-[thunder rumbles]
-[Benedict] Of change.

1:24:37.250 --> 1:24:39.291
NEW EVANGELISM
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EXCLUDED

1:24:39.375 --> 1:24:42.125
[woman 1, in Spanish]
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1:24:42.208 --> 1:24:46.125
I hate my former mother-in-law.

1:24:46.583 --> 1:24:48.833
I want to kill her.

1:24:48.916 --> 1:24:51.000
[man 1] Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1:24:51.083 --> 1:24:53.958
[Bergoglio, in English] I heard a lot
of confessions. I learned to listen.

1:24:54.041 --> 1:24:56.958
[man 1, in Spanish] I have bad thoughts.
I masturbate many times a day.

1:24:57.041 --> 1:24:58.791
[man 2] Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1:24:58.875 --> 1:25:00.791
I live in sin constantly...

1:25:01.625 --> 1:25:03.666
[man 3] ...I feel very ashamed about it...

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:05.708
[woman 2] I'm always depressed.

1:25:05.791 --> 1:25:08.000
[man 1] ...looking at them
with sexual desire...

1:25:08.083 --> 1:25:09.833
[confessions overlapping]

1:25:09.916 --> 1:25:11.458
I feel I'm a fraud...

1:25:11.583 --> 1:25:13.375
[confessions grow louder]

1:25:25.958 --> 1:25:27.958
[silence falls]

1:25:41.250 --> 1:25:43.250
[wind blowing]

1:25:44.875 --> 1:25:46.875
[young Bergoglio] I had a TV.

1:25:50.333 --> 1:25:51.666
I liked to watch football.

1:25:53.291 --> 1:25:55.958
A TV needs an antenna and a signal.

1:25:57.958 --> 1:26:00.375
Sometimes the signal is bad.

1:26:01.333 --> 1:26:06.083
We don't know why,
but sometimes it doesn't work.

1:26:08.166 --> 1:26:10.166
It's the same when we pray.

1:26:12.125 --> 1:26:16.375
Sometimes the signal God sends us
is strong and clear.

1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.750
It works fine. One feels the connection,

1:26:19.833 --> 1:26:22.750
that we are really plugged-in,

1:26:22.833 --> 1:26:24.541
in direct contact.

1:26:26.375 --> 1:26:28.458
But other days...

1:26:31.208 --> 1:26:33.916
one can only say,

1:26:34.708 --> 1:26:37.000
"Well... at least I tried."

1:26:38.458 --> 1:26:41.666
But you've gotten nothing back.

1:26:42.666 --> 1:26:44.666
You don't have an answer.

1:26:48.416 --> 1:26:52.750
You say,
"Father, that doesn't happen to you."

1:26:53.958 --> 1:26:57.125
People believe that for us
it's different...

1:26:57.208 --> 1:26:58.583
That we have...

1:26:59.583 --> 1:27:01.250
a direct line with God.

1:27:03.791 --> 1:27:05.041
No, it's not like that.

1:27:05.791 --> 1:27:08.916
For us, it's the same as for you,
and you...

1:27:16.666 --> 1:27:17.958
[sighs]

1:27:20.791 --> 1:27:22.416
What I mean is...

1:27:27.541 --> 1:27:29.791
today, I'm not worthy
of delivering a sermon.

1:27:32.291 --> 1:27:36.333
My words would be empty.

1:27:41.083 --> 1:27:43.208
Today, you should teach me.

1:27:47.333 --> 1:27:48.833
That would be the best.

1:27:56.958 --> 1:27:58.958
[wind blows]

1:28:13.708 --> 1:28:16.500
[faint ringing]

1:28:18.125 --> 1:28:21.875
[applause]

1:28:21.958 --> 1:28:24.916
[Bergoglio, in English]
We have known tyranny in this country...

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:26.625
[camera shutters clicking]

1:28:26.708 --> 1:28:30.541
...but a new tyranny rises up.

1:28:31.291 --> 1:28:32.583
Not just here,

1:28:33.250 --> 1:28:34.666
but around the world.

1:28:34.750 --> 1:28:39.000
[in Spanish] You talk about tyranny!
Your friends were tyrants!

1:28:39.083 --> 1:28:41.583
They took away our companions!

1:28:41.666 --> 1:28:43.750
[man 1] You are an accomplice.

1:28:43.833 --> 1:28:45.416
Friend of the military!

1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:48.291
-Tell the truth!
-Where are they?

1:28:48.583 --> 1:28:51.041
-[man 1] Where are they?
-[both] Where are they?

1:28:52.083 --> 1:28:54.083
[crowd murmuring]

1:28:54.375 --> 1:28:55.541
[door closes]

1:28:55.625 --> 1:28:57.041
[in English] A tyranny...

1:28:57.583 --> 1:29:00.166
not just of repression...

1:29:00.791 --> 1:29:02.166
and oppression...

1:29:02.958 --> 1:29:03.958
or terror.

1:29:04.750 --> 1:29:08.041
A tyranny of unfair economic structures...

1:29:09.916 --> 1:29:12.708
that create huge inequalities.

1:29:14.416 --> 1:29:15.250
You know,

1:29:15.958 --> 1:29:19.500
20 percent of the world's population

1:29:20.166 --> 1:29:22.083
consumes resources

1:29:22.375 --> 1:29:24.916
at a rate that robs the poor nations

1:29:25.458 --> 1:29:27.291
and future generations

1:29:27.375 --> 1:29:29.791
of what they need to survive.

1:29:29.875 --> 1:29:33.666
-[gentle acoustic guitar music playing]
-[wind blows]

1:29:33.750 --> 1:29:35.750
[Bergoglio] Just as the commandment

1:29:36.333 --> 1:29:37.875
"Thou shalt not kill"

1:29:38.916 --> 1:29:41.000
sets a clear limit

1:29:41.583 --> 1:29:44.708
so to safeguard the value of human life,

1:29:45.625 --> 1:29:46.666
so today,

1:29:47.291 --> 1:29:50.625
we also have to say, "Thou shalt not"

1:29:51.750 --> 1:29:54.375
to an economy of exclusion...

1:29:56.083 --> 1:29:57.541
and inequality

1:29:58.125 --> 1:30:00.250
which idolizes money.

1:30:04.958 --> 1:30:06.666
Every community...

1:30:07.541 --> 1:30:10.916
is called to be an instrument
for the liberation...

1:30:12.333 --> 1:30:17.041
the liberation and promotion of the poor.

1:30:21.125 --> 1:30:23.125
["Cuando Tenga la Tierra" playing]

1:30:29.708 --> 1:30:31.125
[young Bergoglio, in Spanish]
How difficult it is

1:30:31.208 --> 1:30:33.041
to get out of ourselves sometimes

1:30:33.666 --> 1:30:35.333
and stop being selfish.

1:30:36.166 --> 1:30:37.666
Because we think,

1:30:38.250 --> 1:30:42.625
"I'll be an idol, be loved, be the Lord."

1:30:42.708 --> 1:30:43.666
It's not like that.

1:30:44.166 --> 1:30:45.875
There's only one Lord. Up there.

1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:49.291
So, I want you to pass the ball.

1:30:49.416 --> 1:30:52.416
Román, you have Lucas here.
Look at him!

1:30:52.500 --> 1:30:53.750
[Román] Sí.

1:30:53.833 --> 1:30:55.833
-Is it clear?
-[boys] Sí.

1:30:55.916 --> 1:30:57.291
-Understood?
-[boys] Yes.

1:30:57.375 --> 1:30:59.000
-Understood?
-[boys] Yes!

1:30:59.083 --> 1:31:00.625
[young Bergoglio] Let's play!

1:31:00.708 --> 1:31:02.666
[boys shout]

1:31:02.750 --> 1:31:05.583
[young Bergoglio] With heart
and short passes!

1:31:06.750 --> 1:31:08.541
Now you are playing as a team.

1:31:12.125 --> 1:31:15.458
[Bergoglio, in English]
We need bridges, not walls. Thank you.

1:31:16.750 --> 1:31:18.125
[in Spanish] Nice to meet you.

1:31:18.250 --> 1:31:20.458
It's a pleasure to listen to you.

1:31:20.541 --> 1:31:23.708
[Benedict, in English] It took years
until Cardinal Quarracino noticed you

1:31:23.791 --> 1:31:25.666
at an international conference.

1:31:27.208 --> 1:31:28.458
You were made bishop.

1:31:30.166 --> 1:31:31.666
But you did not live like one.

1:31:33.083 --> 1:31:34.541
You renounced luxury.

1:31:35.833 --> 1:31:39.208
You did the work once denied
by Fathers Yorio and Jalics.

1:31:39.291 --> 1:31:40.833
[speaking Spanish]

1:31:40.916 --> 1:31:42.416
[congregation] Sí.

1:31:42.500 --> 1:31:43.916
[Bergoglio] I tried to walk the road

1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:46.083
from which I had banished them.

1:31:47.541 --> 1:31:48.875
Every vegetable I chopped,

1:31:49.708 --> 1:31:52.208
every eviction we stopped,

1:31:52.291 --> 1:31:57.083
every case we won,
I saw as some kind of penance.

1:31:57.583 --> 1:31:59.250
-[Benedict] Yeah.
-[chuckles]

1:32:00.958 --> 1:32:02.958
Hm. [takes a deep breath]

1:32:04.541 --> 1:32:07.000
[clicks tongue] I'm just gonna tell you
one little thing.

1:32:07.541 --> 1:32:08.958
We all suffer from...

1:32:09.916 --> 1:32:11.166
spiritual pride.

1:32:11.250 --> 1:32:12.250
We all do.

1:32:12.958 --> 1:32:14.500
You must remember that, uh...

1:32:16.083 --> 1:32:17.125
you are not God.

1:32:18.291 --> 1:32:20.666
"In God, we move, and live,
and have our being."

1:32:21.083 --> 1:32:23.083
We live in God, but we are not of it.

1:32:23.416 --> 1:32:24.708
You're only human.

1:32:28.083 --> 1:32:31.583
-But... there he is.
-[chuckles softly]

1:32:36.791 --> 1:32:39.333
Human. Yeah.

1:32:41.791 --> 1:32:43.125
So... [sighs]

1:32:43.208 --> 1:32:46.291
...if you'll allow me, my son.

1:32:47.750 --> 1:32:48.583
You must...

1:32:49.333 --> 1:32:51.833
believe in the mercy that you preach.

1:32:53.583 --> 1:32:54.916
[in Latin] I absolve you

1:32:55.166 --> 1:32:57.875
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

1:32:58.250 --> 1:32:59.666
-[softly] Amen.
-Hm.

1:33:02.291 --> 1:33:04.041
-[in English] Thank you, Father.
-[door opens]

1:33:04.125 --> 1:33:05.291
[man, in Italian] Holy Father.

1:33:05.375 --> 1:33:06.375
It's nine o'clock.

1:33:06.458 --> 1:33:09.375
-They are opening the doors to the public.
-[Benedict, in English] I forgot.

1:33:09.458 --> 1:33:10.333
Grazie. Danke.

1:33:10.416 --> 1:33:11.958
[in Italian] Would you like me
to delay the opening?

1:33:12.041 --> 1:33:13.916
[in English] No.
Most of these people have waited

1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.458
-most of their lives to see this.
-[chuckles]

1:33:16.750 --> 1:33:17.750
[Benedict] This way.

1:33:18.416 --> 1:33:20.291
Yeah. Come with me,
I want to show you something.

1:33:20.375 --> 1:33:22.458
-[Bergoglio] Grazie.
-[Benedict] This is the sacristy,

1:33:22.541 --> 1:33:25.208
-known as the Chamber of Tears.
-[Bergoglio] Ah.

1:33:25.291 --> 1:33:29.208
[Benedict] I don't know if they're
the tears of, uh, joy or tears of sorrow.

1:33:29.750 --> 1:33:32.583
You know, I came in through that door
as Joseph Ratzinger,

1:33:32.666 --> 1:33:34.083
and I went out through the same door

1:33:34.166 --> 1:33:36.583
-as Pope Benedict XVI.
-[Bergoglio] Ah.

1:33:39.750 --> 1:33:40.750
Oh!

1:33:41.708 --> 1:33:42.625
Grazie.

1:33:42.916 --> 1:33:43.916
Thank you.

1:33:45.083 --> 1:33:47.250
Holy Father, are-- are you hungry?

1:33:47.875 --> 1:33:49.208
-Hungry?
-Ah, sí.

1:33:49.500 --> 1:33:51.666
Yes, perhaps, you know,
I think I am hungry.

1:33:51.750 --> 1:33:55.250
-Do you want me to ask the kitchen to...
-No, no, no, there's no need. There's a...

1:33:55.333 --> 1:33:59.166
There is a place
just in front of the Porta Angelica.

1:33:59.416 --> 1:34:02.416
Oh, you know it?
Excellent pizza and coffee.

1:34:02.500 --> 1:34:03.708
-Pizza?
-[Benedict] Yeah.

1:34:03.791 --> 1:34:05.416
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, no? Okay.

1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:06.333
Pizza, okay.

1:34:06.416 --> 1:34:10.708
[in Italian] A margherita and diavola,
two Fantas, and a coffee.

1:34:11.166 --> 1:34:13.666
-[in English] Please, no photos.
-[assistant] Excuse me.

1:34:13.750 --> 1:34:15.000
-Excuse me.
-Whoa!

1:34:15.083 --> 1:34:16.458
[guard] This way.

1:34:16.541 --> 1:34:17.833
Excuse me.

1:34:17.916 --> 1:34:19.416
You know, always, in the past,

1:34:19.500 --> 1:34:22.500
whenever a pope,
or Holy Father, would eat,

1:34:22.583 --> 1:34:24.375
at every meal, always at his side,

1:34:25.375 --> 1:34:28.666
would be three Jesuit brothers, and...

1:34:29.458 --> 1:34:31.750
-they were his food tasters.
-[chuckles]

1:34:31.958 --> 1:34:36.000
I think the lack of Jesuits has probably
poisoned more than one Holy Father.

1:34:36.083 --> 1:34:39.500
[laughs] Perhaps I should take a bite
out of your slice, huh?

1:34:39.583 --> 1:34:43.000
-Just to be on the safe side.
-No. No. That's mine. That's my pizza.

1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:46.875
-Would you say grace, Holy Father?
-[sniffs] Yes.

1:34:47.791 --> 1:34:48.625
Yes.

1:34:53.833 --> 1:34:56.375
Thank you, Lord, for this food
that we enjoy here,

1:34:56.875 --> 1:34:58.666
in this place outside of time.

1:34:59.750 --> 1:35:02.833
See, Lord, your Church, your flock

1:35:02.916 --> 1:35:04.833
is under attack, is in crisis.

1:35:05.416 --> 1:35:07.875
God, grant us the wisdom
and the strength

1:35:07.958 --> 1:35:10.125
to oppose the hypocrisy
that disfigures her.

1:35:11.375 --> 1:35:12.416
St. Francis,

1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:16.250
intercede for us
as we seek to repair the Church.

1:35:17.958 --> 1:35:19.583
Would you like to add something?

1:35:20.166 --> 1:35:21.000
Amen.

1:35:21.333 --> 1:35:23.000
Amen. It's good.

1:35:23.083 --> 1:35:23.916
Yeah.

1:35:26.958 --> 1:35:27.833
Mm.

1:35:29.125 --> 1:35:30.208
[in Spanish] Good, isn't it?

1:35:30.291 --> 1:35:31.500
Mm! [munches]

1:35:33.833 --> 1:35:35.291
[in English] You know, I was, um...

1:35:36.583 --> 1:35:38.291
thinking about your teachers,

1:35:39.166 --> 1:35:40.583
Yorio and Jalics.

1:35:40.958 --> 1:35:44.375
-Did you ever reconcile with them?
-[Bergoglio] With Jalics, yes.

1:35:44.458 --> 1:35:46.000
We said a Mass together.

1:35:46.083 --> 1:35:48.875
[in Spanish]
Can you light the candles, please?

1:35:49.291 --> 1:35:51.000
[Jalics] They're lit, Father.

1:35:51.125 --> 1:35:53.125
[church bells ringing]

1:35:54.708 --> 1:35:55.541
Jalics.

1:35:57.333 --> 1:35:59.791
Can you pass the stole? We're late.

1:36:03.041 --> 1:36:06.000
[young Bergoglio] In the name
of the Father, the Son,

1:36:06.083 --> 1:36:07.666
and the Holy Spirit.

1:36:07.750 --> 1:36:09.625
-[bells ring]
-[young Bergoglio] Amen.

1:36:10.791 --> 1:36:12.000
Lord, wash me clean...

1:36:12.833 --> 1:36:14.041
from my sins,

1:36:16.125 --> 1:36:17.375
so I can celebrate...

1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:22.666
these sacred mysteries.

1:36:26.958 --> 1:36:28.625
Now, let's give each other,

1:36:29.750 --> 1:36:31.041
everyone,

1:36:32.083 --> 1:36:34.875
a fraternal hug for peace.

1:36:50.875 --> 1:36:52.250
[Bergoglio, in English] We cried...

1:36:53.625 --> 1:36:54.916
in each other's arms.

1:37:19.500 --> 1:37:20.666
[sighs]

1:37:22.791 --> 1:37:23.833
He forgave me.

1:37:27.625 --> 1:37:28.833
[Benedict] And Yorio?

1:37:29.750 --> 1:37:30.583
No.

1:37:32.208 --> 1:37:34.833
To the end, he saw me as a traitor.

1:37:36.875 --> 1:37:38.416
[sighs] And then he died.

1:37:40.708 --> 1:37:44.791
I'm still seen as a divisive figure
in Argentina.

1:37:46.291 --> 1:37:47.125
Huh.

1:37:49.333 --> 1:37:50.166
[chuckles]

1:37:52.041 --> 1:37:53.000
[sighs]

1:37:53.625 --> 1:37:55.375
You know, yesterday you said, uh...

1:37:55.958 --> 1:37:57.291
"Life is never static."

1:37:57.916 --> 1:37:58.750
Yeah?

1:37:59.708 --> 1:38:00.541
Well...

1:38:02.750 --> 1:38:03.750
You know...

1:38:05.458 --> 1:38:09.541
you lead... not by power
and not by intellect,

1:38:09.625 --> 1:38:10.708
but you lead by...

1:38:10.791 --> 1:38:12.625
you particularly, you lead by, um...

1:38:13.083 --> 1:38:15.208
the way you live
or the way you have lived.

1:38:15.416 --> 1:38:17.208
-You've changed.
-[chuckles]

1:38:22.833 --> 1:38:23.958
That man is...

1:38:25.416 --> 1:38:26.500
is still inside me.

1:38:26.583 --> 1:38:27.666
That doubt, it...

1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:29.666
it still exists.

1:38:29.750 --> 1:38:30.750
[Benedict] Mm-hmm.

1:38:31.166 --> 1:38:32.708
-Hmm?
-Um...

1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.166
You think your sins disqualify you,

1:38:35.250 --> 1:38:36.625
but we are all sinners.

1:38:37.375 --> 1:38:39.750
Now, please, hear my confession.

1:38:41.833 --> 1:38:44.208
Well, would you deny me a confession,
Bergoglio?

1:38:44.291 --> 1:38:46.708
No, no, don't kneel.
Don't kneel. Please, Holy Father.

1:38:46.791 --> 1:38:48.625
-[Benedict] Oh.
-[Bergoglio] Sit, please.

1:38:48.708 --> 1:38:53.250
I think if I sit,
it'll have to be an informal confession.

1:38:54.833 --> 1:38:55.833
What should I say?

1:38:56.541 --> 1:38:58.458
I don't know. What do you usually say?

1:39:01.750 --> 1:39:03.666
How long since your last confession?

1:39:04.375 --> 1:39:06.541
Eight... seven... eight days.

1:39:07.083 --> 1:39:09.000
And have you sinned greatly in that...

1:39:09.083 --> 1:39:11.250
I'm sorry,
I-- I don't mean to imply that you...

1:39:11.333 --> 1:39:13.000
[chuckles] Of course I've sinned.

1:39:14.125 --> 1:39:16.833
Several numerous venial sins,

1:39:17.291 --> 1:39:18.166
and, uh...

1:39:19.125 --> 1:39:21.458
But I'm getting too old and, uh, forgetful

1:39:21.541 --> 1:39:22.875
to remember what they are.

1:39:23.416 --> 1:39:25.000
-Can you say that?
-[Benedict] Yeah.

1:39:25.083 --> 1:39:28.125
I didn't know you could say that.
That's... That's useful.

1:39:30.750 --> 1:39:34.458
I've sinned against you, Lord,
whom I should love above all things.

1:39:37.291 --> 1:39:39.541
As a child, I failed you first by not...

1:39:40.375 --> 1:39:43.083
having the courage
to taste of life itself.

1:39:44.958 --> 1:39:47.250
Instead, I hid away in books,
and then study.

1:39:48.625 --> 1:39:49.625
[sighs]

1:39:51.833 --> 1:39:53.000
I know now that this...

1:39:54.083 --> 1:39:56.250
left me empty and void of the world...

1:39:56.916 --> 1:40:00.000
[chuckles] ...for which the Church is...
meant to help.

1:40:04.583 --> 1:40:05.500
Go on.

1:40:11.166 --> 1:40:12.041
[exhales]

1:40:16.666 --> 1:40:18.625
Remember Father Maciel?

1:40:19.791 --> 1:40:21.708
There were claims 12 years ago

1:40:22.291 --> 1:40:25.125
that his molesting of boys

1:40:25.208 --> 1:40:27.208
continued for decades... [voice fades]

1:40:27.291 --> 1:40:29.291
[high-pitched ringing]

1:40:49.250 --> 1:40:51.250
[ringing fades]

1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:54.166
[takes a deep breath]

1:40:54.291 --> 1:40:59.041
Yes, I did not give sufficient attention
to the duties assigned to this one priest.

1:40:59.125 --> 1:41:00.583
Sufficient attention?

1:41:02.583 --> 1:41:03.875
Village after village?

1:41:04.375 --> 1:41:05.208
Yeah.

1:41:05.958 --> 1:41:08.333
-But you knew!
-[Benedict] Yes, I should've known.

1:41:09.166 --> 1:41:10.166
I should've known.

1:41:10.750 --> 1:41:12.875
-The facts were sent to me.
-[Bergoglio] You said there was more.

1:41:12.958 --> 1:41:16.208
Evidence was placed on my desk, but...

1:41:16.291 --> 1:41:19.000
You forgot to love the people
you are meant to protect.

1:41:19.083 --> 1:41:19.916
[Benedict] Yes.

1:41:21.333 --> 1:41:24.458
-I ask forgiveness.
-[Bergoglio] Father...

1:41:25.333 --> 1:41:27.625
if this is the sole reason
you wish to resign,

1:41:27.708 --> 1:41:31.833
it is even more important that you stay,
heal the wound.

1:41:31.916 --> 1:41:34.250
-Listen to me.
-Complete the work you have begun.

1:41:34.333 --> 1:41:36.958
You see,
every reason I give you is not enough.

1:41:37.041 --> 1:41:38.416
So, let me tell you again,

1:41:38.791 --> 1:41:42.541
I can no longer sit
on the Chair of Saint Peter.

1:41:42.625 --> 1:41:45.500
-You're mistaken.
-I cannot feel the presence of God.

1:41:45.583 --> 1:41:48.375
I do not hear His voice,
do you understand me?

1:41:48.458 --> 1:41:50.666
No. No, you're mistaken.
You are mistaken.

1:41:50.750 --> 1:41:52.791
I believe in God. I pray to God!

1:41:53.916 --> 1:41:54.916
Silence!

1:42:06.125 --> 1:42:08.333
I cannot play this role anymore.

1:42:10.208 --> 1:42:11.208
I'm so sorry.

1:42:14.125 --> 1:42:15.166
[exhales]

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.208
Since I was a child, as a boy,

1:42:23.291 --> 1:42:25.625
I always felt His presence with me,
at my side.

1:42:26.083 --> 1:42:28.541
For my entire life, I have been alone,

1:42:29.083 --> 1:42:31.416
but never lonely, until now.

1:42:31.833 --> 1:42:34.166
[Bergoglio sighs] I'm so sorry.

1:42:35.291 --> 1:42:36.125
Yeah.

1:42:39.875 --> 1:42:42.708
But now I can hear His voice
these last two days.

1:42:42.791 --> 1:42:44.208
I've heard His voice again.

1:42:44.291 --> 1:42:45.291
-I'm glad.
-Yes.

1:42:47.875 --> 1:42:52.208
And the voice is the last one
I expected to hear Him speak with.

1:42:52.625 --> 1:42:53.708
It was your voice.

1:42:54.625 --> 1:42:55.875
-[Bergoglio] No.
-Yeah.

1:42:58.666 --> 1:43:02.541
I think, perhaps, I could not hear Him
not because He was withdrawing from me,

1:43:03.250 --> 1:43:04.583
but because He was saying,

1:43:06.166 --> 1:43:07.166
"Go,

1:43:07.958 --> 1:43:09.416
my faithful servant."

1:43:14.208 --> 1:43:15.083
[chuckles softly]

1:43:18.083 --> 1:43:20.000
[Bergoglio] God, the Father of mercies,

1:43:20.416 --> 1:43:22.291
has sent the Holy Spirit among us

1:43:22.666 --> 1:43:24.375
for the forgiveness of sins.

1:43:25.375 --> 1:43:27.958
May God grant you His pardon and peace.

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.333
-And I absolve you of your sins.
-[exhales]

1:43:32.458 --> 1:43:33.458
And remind you...

1:43:34.666 --> 1:43:36.333
that truth may be vital,

1:43:37.291 --> 1:43:38.583
but without love,

1:43:39.458 --> 1:43:40.666
it is unbearable.

1:43:43.291 --> 1:43:45.458
Caritas in veritate. Your book.

1:43:46.291 --> 1:43:47.541
[sighs] Yeah.

1:43:48.458 --> 1:43:51.958
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

1:43:52.291 --> 1:43:53.125
Amen.

1:43:53.541 --> 1:43:54.375
Amen.

1:43:56.375 --> 1:43:57.416
[sighs]

1:43:59.166 --> 1:44:02.041
You have lifted a great burden
from my shoulders.

1:44:03.541 --> 1:44:05.791
-You have placed a heavy one on mine.
-Ah.

1:44:06.041 --> 1:44:06.958
[chuckles softly]

1:44:12.875 --> 1:44:14.000
[indistinct chatter]

1:44:14.833 --> 1:44:16.083
-[Benedict] Huh?
-Uh...

1:44:16.625 --> 1:44:19.958
Is there another way out,
or shall I call security?

1:44:20.083 --> 1:44:22.833
[Benedict] No, no, no, I've hidden
behind security long enough.

1:44:22.916 --> 1:44:24.125
No, they're my people.

1:44:24.208 --> 1:44:25.416
-Oh.
-[Benedict] I'm their pope.

1:44:25.500 --> 1:44:27.541
At least, for now. Come on, let's go.

1:44:38.458 --> 1:44:39.708
[Bergoglio] Scusi. Grazie.

1:44:39.791 --> 1:44:42.500
[Benedict] Scusi. Buongiorno. Buongiorno.

1:44:43.458 --> 1:44:46.250
-[visitors chattering]
-Buongiorno. Buongiorno. Grazie.

1:44:46.666 --> 1:44:48.416
Buongiorno. Buongiorno.

1:44:48.875 --> 1:44:51.125
[crowd exclaims]

1:44:51.791 --> 1:44:54.750
-[Benedict] Buongiorno.
-No, no, no, no. Leave-- Leave him.

1:44:56.166 --> 1:44:58.208
-Look, he's happy.
-Hmm?

1:44:58.666 --> 1:45:00.416
[Bergoglio] Let him have his moment.

1:45:00.500 --> 1:45:01.625
[crowd clamoring]

1:45:04.458 --> 1:45:05.458
Hey.

1:45:12.333 --> 1:45:14.500
[crowd cheers]

1:45:16.583 --> 1:45:19.916
[crowd chants]

1:45:21.916 --> 1:45:22.958
[door opens]

1:45:27.958 --> 1:45:30.166
-You must be pleased to go home.
-Ah...

1:45:30.583 --> 1:45:33.291
-Speaking English is exhausting.
-[chuckles]

1:45:34.083 --> 1:45:37.625
Terrible language,
so many exceptions to so many rules.

1:45:37.708 --> 1:45:38.625
Sí.

1:45:39.916 --> 1:45:40.750
Remember...

1:45:41.166 --> 1:45:43.208
[in Latin] ...silence incarnate.

1:45:43.875 --> 1:45:45.000
[Bergoglio chuckles]

1:45:50.666 --> 1:45:53.083
[Benedict, in English]
Do you know the story of St. Francis?

1:45:53.166 --> 1:45:54.333
When he was asked to...

1:45:55.041 --> 1:45:58.708
told by God to restore His Church,
he thought He meant bricks and mortar.

1:45:58.791 --> 1:46:01.125
-[both chuckle]
-[Benedict] Poor St. Francis.

1:46:01.208 --> 1:46:03.333
Even he made mistakes
and got things wrong.

1:46:03.416 --> 1:46:05.250
-[Bergoglio] Yeah.
-[Benedict] Yeah.

1:46:05.333 --> 1:46:06.166
Well.

1:46:06.333 --> 1:46:07.916
-Ah.
-Holy Father. Bye.

1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:09.000
-Bye.
-No, please.

1:46:09.083 --> 1:46:11.125
-What? [grunts]
-Please. [chuckles]

1:46:11.541 --> 1:46:12.375
What?

1:46:12.458 --> 1:46:15.208
-You know, St. Francis, he loved to dance.
-Oh, yes?

1:46:15.291 --> 1:46:17.208
He would have learned to tango. Hm?

1:46:17.291 --> 1:46:19.625
-Well, it's too late for me.
-No, no, no, no.

1:46:19.708 --> 1:46:21.125
Come. Come. I'll show you.

1:46:21.208 --> 1:46:22.166
-Come. Come. Come.
-No.

1:46:22.250 --> 1:46:24.500
-No, try. Come, I'll teach you. Come.
-No.

1:46:24.583 --> 1:46:25.875
-I can't dance.
-No, so...

1:46:25.958 --> 1:46:28.708
Now, you see, I go forward with my right.

1:46:28.791 --> 1:46:30.166
-Yeah.
-And you go forward...

1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:32.416
[softly] Oh. Non ci credo.

1:46:33.250 --> 1:46:35.583
[counting in Spanish]

1:46:37.416 --> 1:46:39.625
-Huh? One, two...
-[chuckles] One, two.

1:46:39.708 --> 1:46:43.250
...three, four. Half-step.
And to the side, to the side.

1:46:43.333 --> 1:46:46.083
-[piano playing]
-[counts in Spanish]

1:46:46.791 --> 1:46:48.583
[Benedict] No, no, no.

1:46:48.666 --> 1:46:49.958
No, no, go away.

1:46:50.041 --> 1:46:52.500
Leave me alone!  Leave me alone! Go away!
Go!

1:46:52.583 --> 1:46:56.541
Auf Wiedersehen.
Go. Go. To the airport. Go. Ooh!

1:46:57.875 --> 1:46:58.750
Here.

1:46:59.250 --> 1:47:01.041
-That's for you.
-[Bergoglio] Oh!

1:47:01.375 --> 1:47:02.958
-Yeah. Abbey Road.
-[Bergoglio] Well...

1:47:03.041 --> 1:47:04.791
-The Beatles.
-Absolutely.

1:47:04.875 --> 1:47:06.958
-Go now.
-Abbey Road, eh? Beautiful.

1:47:07.208 --> 1:47:08.416
-[Benedict] Ciao.
-Thank you.

1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:10.500
-Eh... Well, my friend...
-[kisses]

1:47:11.666 --> 1:47:12.708
[grunts softly]

1:47:17.083 --> 1:47:19.666
[Benedict] Right. Go on. Auf Wiedersehen.

1:47:19.875 --> 1:47:22.000
-Auf Wiedersehen. Grazie.
-[Benedict] Arrivederci.

1:47:22.416 --> 1:47:23.416
To the airport!

1:47:23.625 --> 1:47:24.708
Don't bring him back.

1:47:24.791 --> 1:47:26.416
-Grazie.
-[Benedict] Arrivederci.

1:47:29.166 --> 1:47:30.000
Ciao.

1:47:31.125 --> 1:47:32.666
-[car door closes]
-Ciao.

1:47:35.250 --> 1:47:36.333
[car door closes]

1:47:37.791 --> 1:47:39.791
