00:15.367 --> 00:16.433
Hi there.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.834
Today we're finding out
about clothing.

00:18.834 --> 00:20.266
- Mm-hmm.

00:20.266 --> 00:21.834
- Oh, be right back.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.100
- Ha ha ha!
- Ahh!

00:24.100 --> 00:26.667
Elmo's wearing hats
and earmuffs and gloves

00:26.667 --> 00:29.100
and a coat and a scarf
and a shirt and a--

00:29.100 --> 00:31.967
Uh, Elmo,
you forgot your shoes.

00:31.967 --> 00:32.967
No, he didn't.

00:35.100 --> 00:38.367
Hang on to your hats
because there's lots
more clothing to come

00:38.367 --> 00:39.400
on "Sesame Street."

00:39.400 --> 00:40.633
Come on, shoe.
Let's kick it.

00:40.633 --> 00:42.200
- Oh, okay.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.166
What? Heh. Hmm...

00:45.166 --> 00:47.834

01:13.567 --> 01:15.033
Sesame Street!

01:19.500 --> 01:22.100
Oh! Bienvenidos.
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.700
Now, who do
we have here?

01:28.700 --> 01:30.433
Is that a no-headed
sweater monster I see?

01:30.433 --> 01:31.567
- Ha ha!

01:31.567 --> 01:33.300
Let's see if we can
figure out who this is.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.567
Oh! Nngh nngh! Mmph!

01:35.567 --> 01:38.567
Well, you have blue pelo.
Rudy has blue hair.

01:38.567 --> 01:41.700
- Mm-hmm.
- And Rudy's cute little horns,

01:41.700 --> 01:43.467
so you must be...

01:43.467 --> 01:46.233
Rudy!
It is you.

01:46.233 --> 01:47.667
Is everything
all right?

01:47.667 --> 01:52.367
No. Something's wrong
with my favorite sweater.

01:52.367 --> 01:53.867
I think
it got smaller.

01:53.867 --> 01:56.800
Oh, really? Well, when's
the last time you wore it?

01:56.800 --> 01:59.100
Um, last year.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.500
Ha ha! I think
I know what's wrong.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.100
You got bigger, but your sweater
didn't grow along with you.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.567
- Mm-hmm.

02:06.567 --> 02:09.800
Oh, no!
Was I supposed
to water it?

02:09.800 --> 02:12.333
Or maybe I should have been
feeding it vegetables.

02:12.333 --> 02:16.166
No, no, no, no.
Sweaters don't grow,
unlike little monsters.

02:16.166 --> 02:20.867
But what am I gonna do?
That's my favorite sweater.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.867
I have to get it on.
Can you help me, Nina?

02:23.867 --> 02:25.300
- I can try.
- Okay.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.033
- Yeah.

02:27.033 --> 02:28.300
All right.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.533
Uh! Uh! Oh!

02:31.533 --> 02:32.533
Ooh... ah!

02:32.533 --> 02:33.734
Yeah!

02:33.734 --> 02:35.700
- We did it! High five.
- Yay!

02:38.000 --> 02:40.033
Uh... uh-oh.

02:40.033 --> 02:42.200
What's wrong?
You want another high five?

02:42.200 --> 02:45.734
Well, I can't
move my arms. Uh! Eh!

02:45.734 --> 02:48.100
Oh, yeah. That sweater's
looking pretty tight.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.367
Oh, no.

02:49.367 --> 02:53.266
How am I gonna play
with my friends like this?

02:53.266 --> 02:54.900
How am I gonna eat lunch?

02:54.900 --> 02:56.834
We should get
that sweater off of you.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.934
All right.
Ready and...

02:58.934 --> 03:01.266
Yeegh... rrgh!

03:01.266 --> 03:02.934
Ah! Ah!

03:02.934 --> 03:04.600
Oof! Yeah.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.266
I'm sorry, Rudy,
but you're a little
too big for your sweater.

03:08.266 --> 03:10.600
Uh... ohh.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.200
What's the point of having
a favorite sweater

03:13.200 --> 03:15.467
if you can't
even wear it?

03:20.600 --> 03:23.200
Well, goodbye,
sweater.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.834
I'm gonna miss you.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.867
Hey, hey, hey!
What's the big idea?

03:27.867 --> 03:30.033
Oh, well, Oscar,
I can't wear

03:30.033 --> 03:32.934
my favorite sweater
anymore, so...

03:32.934 --> 03:34.734
I'm throwing it out.

03:34.734 --> 03:36.767
Huh? But...

03:36.767 --> 03:38.533
but that sweater's
as good as new.

03:38.533 --> 03:40.967
It doesn't belong
in the trash.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.333
Ugh.

03:42.333 --> 03:46.166
Yuck! It even
smells clean. Blehh!

03:47.567 --> 03:50.467
But if I can't
throw it out,

03:50.467 --> 03:52.633
what am I supposed
to do with it?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.300
What do I care?

03:54.300 --> 03:57.533
Come back when you
got something rotten.

03:57.533 --> 04:00.200
Ah! Ohh...

04:05.400 --> 04:08.066
Hey, Rudy,
what you doing?

04:08.066 --> 04:10.600
Oh, I'm just--
I drew some pictures

04:10.600 --> 04:13.533
of all the good times
I had with my sweater.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.166
Do you mind
if I take a look?

04:15.166 --> 04:16.200
Sure.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.000
Wow, it looks like you
and your sweater

04:48.000 --> 04:49.767
have had a lot
of good memories together.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.166
Yeah. I'm just
sad 'cause

04:52.166 --> 04:54.600
I can't make
more memories
with it.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.266
I mean, what do you do with
a sweater you can't wear,

04:57.266 --> 04:59.567
but it's too nice
to throw away?

04:59.567 --> 05:01.800
Well, have you thought
about giving it away?

05:01.800 --> 05:03.900
You want it?
- Oh, well, no.

05:03.900 --> 05:07.700
It's not quite my size,
and I have plenty of sweaters,

05:07.700 --> 05:10.233
but maybe you could find
somebody who needs one.

05:10.233 --> 05:13.033
- That's a great idea.

05:13.033 --> 05:15.967
Huh? Well, to find someone
who needs my favorite sweater.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.066
Well, don't you want
to take this with you, then?

05:18.066 --> 05:21.967
Oh. Heh. Yeah.
Thank you. Bye.

05:23.066 --> 05:24.400
Huh

05:24.400 --> 05:25.767
Well, thanks,
Rudy,

05:25.767 --> 05:27.400
but Bert and I
already have sweaters.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.200
- Yeah, and we're pretty
happy with them, too.
- All right.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.166
Well, I guess I'll try
and find someone else
who needs it.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.834
Huh

05:35.834 --> 05:40.000
Uh, well, thanks,
but I got a sweater, see?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.934
Yeah. See?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:41.934 --> 05:45.066
Oh, well, I don't
need a sweater.

05:45.066 --> 05:49.333
I need shoes.
There. See?

05:49.333 --> 05:50.333
Aww!

05:50.333 --> 05:52.500
Oh, but thanks
for asking.

05:53.867 --> 05:55.900
Oh. How'd it go?

05:55.900 --> 05:57.200
Not good.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.700
I went around
the whole neighborhood,

05:59.700 --> 06:02.867
but I couldn't find anyone
who needs a sweater.

06:02.867 --> 06:05.166
Well, you know, when
someone's looking for a bike,

06:05.166 --> 06:07.934
they know they can come
to my bike shop to get one.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.900
Yeah, but how do
we let people know

06:09.900 --> 06:12.066
where to find
my sweater?

06:12.066 --> 06:14.533
We could do this thing
called a clothing drive.

06:14.533 --> 06:16.667
- Well, it's when
the whole neighborhood

06:16.667 --> 06:18.934
comes together to give away
clothes they don't need anymore

06:18.934 --> 06:20.834
to people who
do need them.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.133
Wow. That sounds great.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.767
Yeah. I'll help you
set everything up,

06:24.767 --> 06:27.333
but first, we need
to collect clothes
to give away.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.967
Okay. I'll ask everybody
in the whole neighborhood.

06:29.967 --> 06:31.800
Great. I'll meet you
at Hooper's.

06:35.467 --> 06:38.533
Wow. We've gotten so many
clothes donated already.

06:38.533 --> 06:41.700
This is gonna be
a great clothing drive.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.467
Thanks for helping us
sort everything, Julia.

06:43.467 --> 06:45.900
- Yeah.
- Pants, shirts.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.700
Rudy, I can give away
this hat and this scarf

06:48.700 --> 06:50.433
that I don't wear anymore.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.734
- Oh, thank you, Big Bird.
- You're welcome.

06:52.734 --> 06:54.934
I've got some more stuff
at my nest. I'll be right back.

06:54.934 --> 06:56.934
- Okay.
- Okay. Ha ha!

06:58.233 --> 06:59.934
Scarf here.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.100
Ernie:
Oh, Nina!

07:01.100 --> 07:03.033
Bert and I brought some clothes
to give away, too.

07:03.033 --> 07:05.467
Yeah. Yeah.
Here you go. Ah!

07:05.467 --> 07:08.133
Ho ho! Maravilloso.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.166
- Yep.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.100
Don't worry. I've got
12 more at home.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.700
See you, guys.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.100
Thank you, Bert.
Thank you, Ernie. Ha ha!

07:18.700 --> 07:21.133
Oh, Nina, look!

07:21.133 --> 07:23.667
Look at all the people
bringing their clothes.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.333
Yeah. Well, that's
the great thing about

07:25.333 --> 07:27.333
being part
of a neighborhood community.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.300
You help other people out
when they need something.

07:29.300 --> 07:32.433
Mm-hmm.
Let me see.
Oh! Shoes!

07:32.433 --> 07:35.100
Oh, thank you.
I needed shoes.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.100
Happy to help.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.100
Oh!

07:37.100 --> 07:41.000
This will keep me warm.
Ohh...

07:41.000 --> 07:45.433
Wow. Look at all
the people we're helping.

07:52.767 --> 07:54.667
Nina:
Wow.

07:54.667 --> 07:58.100
- Bert: All right, what
a successful clothing drive.
-  Bye-bye.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.300
Well, this was great.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.734
We got to help
so many people
who needed clothes.

08:01.734 --> 08:02.734
- Nina: Yeah.
- Rudy: Yeah.

08:02.734 --> 08:03.767
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.166
Bye.

08:07.800 --> 08:12.400
Oh, but I guess
nobody needed my sweater.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.667
Oh, we're not too late
for the clothing drive, are we?

08:15.667 --> 08:17.934
Oh, no, no. We still have
plenty of things left.

08:19.233 --> 08:23.500
Ah! Oh, wow!
Oh, look at this!

08:23.500 --> 08:27.000
Ooh! That is
a nice-looking sweater.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.266
It's an awesome sweater!

08:29.266 --> 08:30.934
Okay.

08:30.934 --> 08:34.000
Let's see
if it fits. Ah!

great sweater.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.834
It's a super
great sweater!

08:46.834 --> 08:50.400
Oh, thank you so much
for having this clothing drive.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.066
Yeah. We really needed
a new sweater for our daughter,

08:53.066 --> 08:56.233
- so this really
helps us out a lot.
- Well, thank Rudy.

08:56.233 --> 08:58.800
- Everything happened
because of him.
- Oh, thank you, Rudy.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.700
- Thank you, Rudy.
It's so warm!
- You're welcome.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.767

09:03.767 --> 09:06.300
and I can't wait
for all my friends
to see me in it!

09:06.300 --> 09:10.600
Aww. I hope
that sweater makes you
as happy as it made me.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.300
It makes me super happy!
Oh, I love this sweater.

09:14.300 --> 09:19.900
I love it so much.
I love this sweater!

09:25.934 --> 09:29.333
Something's wrong
with my favorite sweater.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.266
I think it got smaller.
What am I gonna do?

09:32.266 --> 09:34.467
Well, have you thought
about giving it away?

Hey, do you want
this scooter?

09:45.734 --> 09:47.000
It's too small for me.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.533
- Yes, please. Thank you.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.700
Girl:
My friends and I
are taking a class

10:55.700 --> 10:57.467
to learn
how to make clothes.

10:57.467 --> 10:59.800
- Kids: Clothes!
- I'm sewing.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.900
I'm cutting a pattern
for my dress.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.567
Kids:
Clothes!

11:07.567 --> 11:09.333
I'm gonna turn
these into pockets.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.500
You're gonna stick
the needle

11:10.500 --> 11:12.333
through one of your holes
in your button.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.767
- Kids: Clothes!
- The buttons jingle.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.367
Girl:
We are measuring.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.467
Woman:
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ohh ♪

11:21.467 --> 11:22.367
Kids:
Clothes!

11:24.033 --> 11:25.967
It sparkles.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.266
I made pockets
like my hands.

11:31.934 --> 11:33.533
These are my pants.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.433
I painted
this part myself.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.533
- It's great.
- Thanks.

11:42.533 --> 11:44.166
I made it myself.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.500
"C" is for "clothes"!

11:48.500 --> 11:50.233
Girl:
The letter "C."

11:52.200 --> 11:53.567
There are different
types of clothes

11:53.567 --> 11:56.633
for each
of the four seasons.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.667
I love winter.

12:00.467 --> 12:04.300
In winter I wear a scarf,
a coat, a hat, and boots.

12:05.467 --> 12:08.066
Oh, and gloves
to keep my hands warm

12:08.066 --> 12:11.467
when I build snowmen
and throw snowballs!

12:11.467 --> 12:14.533
In the spring,
it is warm and rainy.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.867
I wear a raincoat and galoshes
so I can stay dry

12:17.867 --> 12:20.734
when I jump in puddles
with my dog Spot.

12:22.467 --> 12:25.767
After spring comes summer,
the hottest season.

12:25.767 --> 12:27.934
I stay cool
by going to the beach

12:27.934 --> 12:31.433
in my swimsuit
and my swim vest.

12:32.667 --> 12:37.066
Finally when summer ends,
fall cools things down.

12:37.066 --> 12:40.166
I can wear a flannel shirt
or a jacket.

12:40.166 --> 12:43.834
I wear sneakers on my feet
when I jump in leaves
with Spot.

12:43.834 --> 12:47.700
I love dressing for each
of the four seasons.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.934
Announcer:
Smart Cookies--

12:48.934 --> 12:51.367
a tough batch
of home-baked heroes.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.800
There's the tech genius
Figby,

12:53.800 --> 12:56.367
Miss Fortune,
Chipowski,

12:56.367 --> 12:59.266
- and the rookie,
Cookie Monster.
- Hello!

12:59.266 --> 13:00.633
Announcer:
Together, they have
one mission--

13:00.633 --> 13:02.166
to stop the Crumb.

13:02.166 --> 13:06.000
Today, I'm going
to mess up some dress-up.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.266
Ha ha ha!

13:08.266 --> 13:10.133
I've located
the Crumb.

13:10.133 --> 13:12.567
- All: Let's roll!
- Figby: Whoa!

13:12.567 --> 13:14.333
Announcer:
Will the Smart Cookies
catch the Crumb?

13:14.333 --> 13:17.667
Find out now
on "Smart Cookies."

13:21.367 --> 13:23.033
Cookies:
Smart Cookies!

13:23.033 --> 13:27.166
Oh! Oh, Smart Cookies,
thank goodness you've arrived.

13:27.166 --> 13:28.867
You have got
to keep the Crumb

13:28.867 --> 13:31.200
out of my "dress up
like a cookie" party.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.834
Yeah. Right.
Uh, what Crumb
look like again?

13:33.834 --> 13:36.233
He looks like this.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.266
You know, maybe
a little cookie snack

13:38.266 --> 13:39.300
would help me focus.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.166
Aah! Not my flaky
outer layer!

13:41.166 --> 13:44.500
You know what?
We will guard the door.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.033
You just stay out
of the way.

13:47.033 --> 13:48.233
Okay. Me got it.

13:51.233 --> 13:52.367
Uh...

13:54.433 --> 13:55.967
Oh, hello.

13:55.967 --> 13:58.900
- Hi.
- Uh, I'm an invited guest

13:58.900 --> 14:01.300
who likes
to sneak into parties

14:01.300 --> 14:02.300
through the wall.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.233
Mmm. Well, that not sound
shady at all.

14:05.233 --> 14:08.300
- No.
- Well, me got to make sure
that you not the Crumb.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.633
Oh, of course.

14:09.633 --> 14:13.000
Same eyes, same nose.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.800
Hey, you definitely
the Crumb.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.200
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I have a mustache.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.734
Uh, no, you don't.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.033
Uh... oh!

14:22.767 --> 14:24.533
- Oh, yeah. Me see it now.
- Mm-hmm.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.834
Okay. You definitely
not the Crumb.

14:26.834 --> 14:30.033
- Enjoy party.
- Thank you.

14:30.033 --> 14:33.467
Time to mess up
this dress-up.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.500
Ha ha! Behold.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.433
Uh-oh.
What

14:43.433 --> 14:46.400
Hey. Gaah!

14:46.400 --> 14:49.467
Ohh! Ohh! Oh, no!
My cookie party
is ruined.

14:49.467 --> 14:52.600
The Crumb strikes again.
Ha ha ha!

14:54.633 --> 14:59.100
Oh! Oh, no! Baah!
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

14:59.100 --> 15:02.600
What
This bear claw
is a big problem.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.200
We've got to stop it.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.967
Me on it! Hyah!

15:06.967 --> 15:09.233
Ho ho ho!

15:09.233 --> 15:14.066
Whoa! Whoa!

15:14.066 --> 15:15.967
Miss Fortune:
Waah!

15:15.967 --> 15:20.166
Oh, boy. Uhh!
Oh, why that not work?

15:20.166 --> 15:22.700
Because you can't
just grab

15:22.700 --> 15:24.467
a bad, bad bear claw.

15:24.467 --> 15:28.066
You have to stop
and think it through.

15:28.066 --> 15:30.066
Oh, I'm getting a clue.

15:30.066 --> 15:32.233
Hnnngh!

15:32.233 --> 15:36.367
Oh. If we want
to stop the claw,
we need Smart Cookies?

15:36.367 --> 15:41.000
Oh, if only
Smart Cookies
were here.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.033
Wait a minute.
Smart Cookies are here,

15:43.033 --> 15:46.734
so that mean
that one of us
can stop bear claw.

15:46.734 --> 15:49.400
Well, we already know
it's not you, big surprise.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.166
Yeah. That true,
so maybe it you.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.300
Wait! What?

15:52.300 --> 15:54.834
- Hyah!
- Whoa!

15:54.834 --> 15:57.133
I should've taken
a desk job!

15:57.133 --> 15:59.800
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

15:59.800 --> 16:02.133
Oh! Uhh...

16:02.133 --> 16:05.667
Oh, boy. Oh, me guess
it not Figby.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.467
- No.
- Maybe it you two.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.500
I got a bad feeling
about this.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.567
Chipowski:
Yow! Ooh! D'oh!

16:12.567 --> 16:14.934
Cookie Monster:
Oh! Ohh...

16:14.934 --> 16:16.100
oh, no.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.567
We all tried,
and nothing worked.

16:18.567 --> 16:21.834
Smart Cookies failed. Ohh!

16:21.834 --> 16:24.500
Cookie, snap out of it.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.567
If we're gonna fix this problem,
we have to stop and--

16:28.567 --> 16:30.734
And think it through!

16:30.734 --> 16:33.033
- That's right.
- Yes! Okay.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.967
The clue is Smart Cookies.

16:35.967 --> 16:37.600
This is silly.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.000
There's not one of us
who could stop it.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.767
But maybe all of us
can stop it.

16:43.767 --> 16:47.333
Maybe we need to cooperate
and work together.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.700
That is some
good thinking there, rookie.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.800
All right, Smart Cookies.
Let's work together as a team.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.700
All:
Smart Cookie formation!

16:56.700 --> 16:58.333
- Ho-oh!
- Hyah-uh!

16:58.333 --> 17:00.400
- Hi-yah!
- Hah-hickey-doop!

17:02.800 --> 17:04.967
- Figby: Yaah!
- Cookie Monster: Whoa!

17:04.967 --> 17:06.934
- Whoa!
- Chipowski: Come on, team!

17:06.934 --> 17:10.467
Everybody pull! Huh!

17:10.467 --> 17:12.000
Oh, ho ho ho!

17:12.000 --> 17:15.467
- Miss Fortune: Whoa!
- Figby: Come on!

17:19.467 --> 17:23.533
Ohh! Uh!
Oh, the party is saved!

17:23.533 --> 17:25.033
Yeah. Hooray!

17:25.033 --> 17:27.967
I'll get you
next time, Smart Cookies.

17:27.967 --> 17:31.767
- After him.
- Oh, wait. Me just need
little snack first.

17:31.767 --> 17:32.967
Aah! No!

17:34.533 --> 17:37.400

20:36.734 --> 20:41.233
Oh, guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:41.233 --> 20:43.233
Wait for it.

20:43.233 --> 20:45.800
Wai-ai-ait for it!

20:45.800 --> 20:48.934
Oh, ho ho! Clothing!

20:48.934 --> 20:52.133
Boy, look at all these
different kinds of clothes.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.533
Cool. Elmo loves clothes

20:54.533 --> 20:57.734
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:57.734 --> 21:02.033
Hey, let's ask
Elmo's friend Smartie.

21:02.033 --> 21:03.600
Let's call her together.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.100
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:07.100 --> 21:09.100
Ha ha ha! Wha--

21:09.100 --> 21:10.467
Hiya, Elmo.

21:10.467 --> 21:13.533
Hey, Smartie,
looking good!

21:13.533 --> 21:16.367
Thanks, Elmo.
I'm all dressed
and ready to go.

21:16.367 --> 21:18.567
This is
my favorite outfit.

21:18.567 --> 21:20.133
Cool!

21:20.133 --> 21:21.834
Oh, that's perfect,
Smartie,

21:21.834 --> 21:25.033
because Elmo wants to learn
all about clothing.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.867
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:27.867 --> 21:30.800
All:
♪ We look it up ♪

21:30.800 --> 21:32.934
Let's buckle down
and start learning.

21:32.934 --> 21:33.867
Here we go.

21:35.266 --> 21:37.300
Smartie:
People wear clothes
every day.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.133
We wear different
kinds of clothes

21:39.133 --> 21:40.600
in different
kinds of weather.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.567
Sometimes grownups wear
special clothes for their jobs.

21:44.567 --> 21:46.467
Firefighters wear pants
and jackets

21:46.467 --> 21:48.133
to protect them from fire.

21:48.133 --> 21:49.633
And doctors and nurses

21:49.633 --> 21:52.033
wear scrubs
to keep them clean.

21:52.033 --> 21:54.467
People from different cultures
sometimes wear

21:54.467 --> 21:56.100
different kinds of clothes,

21:56.100 --> 21:59.433
like kurtas,
hijabs, and kilts.

21:59.433 --> 22:01.767
There are lots of different
styles of clothing.

22:01.767 --> 22:04.200
You can wear whatever
makes you happy.

22:05.333 --> 22:08.600
Wow. Oh,
speaking of clothes, look!

22:08.600 --> 22:11.900
Elmo just got a new
favorite T-shirt.

22:11.900 --> 22:15.500
Oh, wow.
Looks great to me, Elmo.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.100
Well, got to go.
See you later, Elmo.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.333
Oh, ho ho! Thank you,
Smartie. Bye-bye.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.133
Boy, Smartie's right.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.200
There's so many
different kinds of clothes.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.967
Hey, that gives
Elmo an idea.

22:29.967 --> 22:32.633
Oh, let's play
a game together.

22:32.633 --> 22:35.166
Yeah. Come on,
come on.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.133
Ha ha ha!

22:41.667 --> 22:46.133
Oh. Owen needs to get dressed
for a hot summer day.

22:46.133 --> 22:50.066
Elmo wonders if we can help him
pick out his clothes.

22:50.066 --> 22:52.967
Are you ready? Let's play!

22:52.967 --> 22:55.667
Let's pick out a shirt
for Owen.

22:55.667 --> 22:58.433
Is this sweater right
for a hot day?

22:58.433 --> 23:01.867
Boy:
No. That sweater
is for cold weather.

23:01.867 --> 23:03.800
Is this the right shirt?

23:03.800 --> 23:06.467
Boy:
Yes. That's the right shirt.

23:06.467 --> 23:09.233
Cool. Is he ready
to go outside?

23:09.233 --> 23:11.934
Boy:
No. He needs something
on the bottom.

23:11.934 --> 23:15.734
Oh, right.
Should Owen wear these?

23:15.734 --> 23:18.533
Boy:
No. Those are pajamas.

23:18.533 --> 23:22.233
Oh, yeah.
Pajamas are for sleeping.

23:22.233 --> 23:25.166
Are these clothes right
for a hot day?

23:25.166 --> 23:28.200
Boy:
Yes. You wear shorts
in the summer.

23:28.200 --> 23:32.300
Yeah. Now let's find
Owen's shoes.

23:32.300 --> 23:34.433
How about these sandals?

23:34.433 --> 23:37.600
Boy:
Yes. You wear sandals
in hot weather.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.433
Yay! Bye-bye, Owen.

23:40.433 --> 23:43.600
Boy, there's lots
of different kinds of clothes.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.433
Oh, and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:47.433 --> 23:50.066
Oh, does Mr. Noodle
know about clothes?

23:50.066 --> 23:51.734
Oh, let's ask him.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.667
♪ Hey, Mr. Noodle! ♪

23:54.667 --> 23:58.900
Oh, it's Mr. Noodle's poodle,
Schmoodle.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.033
- Elmo and kids: Hi, Schmoodle!

24:01.033 --> 24:03.834
Oh, Schmoodle,
do you know about clothes?

24:06.500 --> 24:08.900
What do you wear when
you go to bed, Schmoodle?

24:08.900 --> 24:10.300
Boy:
Yeah. Show us.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.300
Elmo:
Schmoodle!

24:13.300 --> 24:15.300
Those aren't the clothes
you wear to bed.

24:15.300 --> 24:18.834
Boy:
No. Those are too fancy.

24:18.834 --> 24:21.867
Elmo:
It's okay, Schmoodle.
Show us what you wear to bed.

24:21.867 --> 24:24.300
Boy:
Yeah. You can do it.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.100
Elmo:
A mermaid costume?

24:27.100 --> 24:29.433
Boy:
That isn't
what you wear to bed.

24:29.433 --> 24:31.800
Elmo:
Try again.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.500
Boy:
You did it!

24:33.500 --> 24:37.266
Elmo:
Yeah. Now you've got it.
You're wearing pajamas.

24:37.266 --> 24:39.333
Boy:
Pajamas are clothes
you wear to bed.

24:39.333 --> 24:42.900
Thank you for showing us
clothes, Schmoodle. Bye-bye.

24:42.900 --> 24:47.567
