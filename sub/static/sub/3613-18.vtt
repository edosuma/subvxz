00:03.586 --> 00:05.589
<i>I wake up at night.</i>

00:05.756 --> 00:07.549
<i>My heart pounding,</i>

00:07.716 --> 00:10.552
a voice whispering in my head:
"You're a fraud.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.888
You can't fool God."

00:13.055 --> 00:16.725
These are not new fears, Brendan.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.935
I've watched you grow, wept for you,

00:19.102 --> 00:20.395
rejoiced in you.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.564
You are not a fraud.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.316
I know your heart.

00:24.483 --> 00:27.235
You don't know my family, Father.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.654
Generations of evil.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.448
Evil that's in my blood.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.617
The blood of the sacrament
washes it clean.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.410
Hello, Brendan.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.788
Long time, no see.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.958
- How'd you find me?
- Yeah, good to see you too.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.711
Didn't mean to interrupt
your conversation.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.838
We'll wait outside for you

00:47.005 --> 00:48.757
so we can have a family reunion.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.146
Hey, you know what, the next time
Quake does a food pantry,

01:03.313 --> 01:04.480
why don't you call some guys.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.233
Yeah, I'll just go through
my handy guy Rolodex.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.278
Which I believe now stops
at J for Josh.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.238
Or is it B for boyfriend?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.073
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.117
Why not, Piper?
You know you like him,

01:16.284 --> 01:17.994
and he calls you all the time.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.662
Why don't you just go out with him.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.581
I told you. Because I'm too busy
with work,

01:21.748 --> 01:23.875
and my instincts are telling me
to lay low.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.960
Always trust your instincts.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.755
Whose side are you on?

01:30.798 --> 01:34.010
- Now, they have got the right idea.
- Who, the nuns?

01:34.218 --> 01:36.512
Yep. Nice, safe environment.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.181
Yeah, if you like monks.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.934
Stress-free, no need to worry
about guys, no wardrobe.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.312
No wardrobe? Okay,

01:44.479 --> 01:45.980
now you're scaring me.

01:49.650 --> 01:50.860
Whose pen is this?

01:51.068 --> 01:52.904
Oh, it's Brendan's, I think.

01:53.070 --> 01:55.615
You know, the cute guy who signed
for the food. Remember?

01:55.823 --> 01:58.284
- I remember him, yes.
- Good, then you can take it to him.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.161
I think he's in the church office.

02:00.369 --> 02:03.289
Okay, just don't go taking any vows
while I'm gone, all right?

02:11.130 --> 02:15.009
Cute guy. I just saw him
being attacked by a warlock.

02:15.217 --> 02:17.261
- Where?
- I think it was here, somewhere.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.555
All right, let's split up.

02:20.639 --> 02:22.308
Give it up, little brother.

02:22.516 --> 02:24.602
You're praying to the wrong deity.

02:25.394 --> 02:27.479
Aren't you, Brendan?

02:27.646 --> 02:29.940
I mean, after all,

02:30.107 --> 02:31.901
you can't deny who you are.

02:32.109 --> 02:33.569
You don't scare me, Greg.

02:34.153 --> 02:36.071
Sure, I do.

02:45.414 --> 02:48.500
We've come a long way to find you.

02:49.793 --> 02:52.629
We're not leaving until you join us.

02:52.963 --> 02:55.883
Please, Brendan.
We don't wanna hurt you.

03:02.055 --> 03:06.268
Did you really think that the Church
could save you?

03:12.316 --> 03:13.442
Hey.

03:17.738 --> 03:19.448
- Piper, Phoebe!
- We'll come back for you.

03:19.656 --> 03:21.074
- Prue?
- You guys, over here.

03:22.909 --> 03:25.412
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

03:25.579 --> 03:29.207
- Thanks.
- Wait, where...?

03:29.374 --> 03:31.042
Hey.

03:31.209 --> 03:32.627
What happened?

03:32.794 --> 03:36.006
I don't know,
but I'm gonna go find out.

05:27.575 --> 05:30.661
Amazing reflexes. Check it out.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.455
Should've kept a closer watch
over Brendan over the years.

05:33.873 --> 05:35.666
We shouldn't have left him alone.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.751
Seriously, you gotta see this. Watch.

05:37.918 --> 05:40.921
I am sick and tired of you
and this freaking lizard.

05:41.088 --> 05:43.424
Yeah? Too bad.

05:47.803 --> 05:49.930
I'm sorry. Okay?

05:50.597 --> 05:53.142
Just stay away from my pet.
That's all I ask.

05:56.562 --> 05:58.397
Maybe we should let Brendan go.

05:58.605 --> 06:00.566
I mean, we don't really need him.

06:00.732 --> 06:02.443
It's not like we don't already
have powers.

06:02.651 --> 06:05.070
Without his powers,
we can't complete our triangle.

06:06.405 --> 06:08.448
Paul, the prophecy
of the Rowe Coven.

06:08.615 --> 06:10.534
He must accept his heritage.

06:10.701 --> 06:12.202
He must be initiated as a warlock.

06:12.411 --> 06:14.955
Initiated how? We can't force him
to kill an innocent.

06:15.247 --> 06:16.373
Maybe not.

06:19.001 --> 06:21.670
But we can stir his inner nature.

06:21.837 --> 06:23.964
The part that he thinks
he's suppressed.

06:24.131 --> 06:25.507
Make him wanna kill.

06:25.716 --> 06:27.467
By tomorrow? Not a chance.

06:27.634 --> 06:29.636
Once he's been ordained, he's safe.

06:29.803 --> 06:31.680
He can never become a warlock.

06:31.847 --> 06:35.851
In which case,
we will have to kill him.

06:40.939 --> 06:42.107
Hello?

06:42.274 --> 06:45.902
Oh, hello, Josh. How are you?

06:46.236 --> 06:47.571
I will call him back.

06:47.779 --> 06:50.156
Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on a sec.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.910
You're dirty.

06:54.077 --> 06:55.579
Hello?

06:56.913 --> 06:59.582
No, that's all right.
I'm always up this early.

06:59.749 --> 07:01.710
What's that?

07:01.918 --> 07:03.211
My horoscope said that?

07:03.378 --> 07:05.046
Really?

07:05.213 --> 07:08.508
Oh, well, that's a shame,
because I have to work Friday night.

07:08.717 --> 07:09.801
Yep, Saturday too.

07:09.968 --> 07:11.678
Okay, I'm gonna go change
the cat litter.

07:11.845 --> 07:12.971
Phoebe.

07:13.138 --> 07:16.266
What? What is the problem?
She likes him. He likes her.

07:16.433 --> 07:18.935
The problem is
it's none of our business.

07:19.144 --> 07:22.814
I... I've gotta go now, so...
Thanks for calling, though.

07:22.981 --> 07:24.315
Yeah, but I gotta go to work.

07:24.482 --> 07:27.193
I'll be there all day and all night.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.862
Yep. Gotta go, bye.

07:32.407 --> 07:35.827
Okay, you know what, it's your life.
You wanna be a nun? Godspeed.

07:35.994 --> 07:37.036
Thank you.

07:37.245 --> 07:38.663
Now, back to our warlock crisis.

07:38.830 --> 07:41.874
Why do we think they're after...?
What's his name again?

07:42.083 --> 07:43.960
Brendan, and I don't know.
I couldn't find him.

07:44.127 --> 07:46.087
But I've seen him
at the church before.

07:46.254 --> 07:48.881
I'm hoping that
the parish priest can help.

07:49.090 --> 07:50.508
Yeah, well, you better hope Brendan

07:50.675 --> 07:52.218
doesn't tell anybody
about your powers,

07:52.385 --> 07:54.595
or else we've got bigger problems
than just warlocks.

07:54.804 --> 07:56.430
Yeah, but I don't think he will.

07:56.597 --> 07:58.391
There's something in his eyes.

07:58.975 --> 08:00.560
I don't know.

08:00.768 --> 08:02.937
It just seemed like
he wasn't surprised by it.

08:04.313 --> 08:05.565
All right.

08:05.856 --> 08:08.192
I've gotta go. I'll call you guys
if I find out anything.

08:08.776 --> 08:10.111
Do you want us to go with you?

08:10.945 --> 08:12.446
You have to work, remember?

08:17.243 --> 08:20.037
Don't you dare answer that.

08:20.204 --> 08:21.997
Sit down.

08:23.916 --> 08:25.126
Excuse me.

08:25.334 --> 08:26.419
- Yes.
- Father Austin?

08:26.585 --> 08:28.712
- Yes.
- Hi.

08:28.879 --> 08:29.922
I'm Prue Halliwell.

08:30.089 --> 08:32.341
My sister helped coordinate
the food for last night's...

08:32.508 --> 08:35.970
Piper, right. Of course.

08:36.136 --> 08:37.513
I'm very grateful to her.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.765
It was a wonderful evening.

08:40.265 --> 08:43.394
Except for what happened in here.

08:43.727 --> 08:45.187
Actually, that's why I'm here.

08:46.188 --> 08:47.606
Do you know someone
named Brendan?

08:47.773 --> 08:49.775
I think he was one of the volunteers.

08:49.984 --> 08:53.612
I know Brendan very well.

08:53.779 --> 08:56.532
You don't think he had
anything to do with this?

08:56.740 --> 08:59.535
No, no.

08:59.702 --> 09:04.957
But I did see two other men
trying to hurt him.

09:05.749 --> 09:07.543
I mean, he's fine.
He got away all right.

09:07.751 --> 09:09.837
But I don't think that
they're gonna stop trying.

09:11.046 --> 09:12.965
He always said they'd come.

09:13.173 --> 09:15.384
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

09:15.551 --> 09:20.138
It's just something I know Brendan's
been wrestling with his whole life.

09:22.182 --> 09:24.017
Do you know where I might
be able to find him?

09:25.644 --> 09:27.062
Why do you want to?

09:28.272 --> 09:30.524
I think he's in trouble.

09:30.691 --> 09:32.317
And I might be able to help him.

09:33.193 --> 09:34.653
You?

09:35.487 --> 09:36.571
How?

09:39.157 --> 09:42.994
I can't really tell you that, Father.
I'm sorry.

09:43.203 --> 09:47.249
It's kind of personal.
I just have to ask you to trust me.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.551
So the lunch rush is almost over and
then you're closed till dinner, right?

09:57.717 --> 09:59.803
- Yeah, why?
- Just curious.

09:59.970 --> 10:01.888
Have you heard from Prue yet?

10:02.055 --> 10:04.516
No, not yet.

10:06.685 --> 10:09.062
What?

10:10.188 --> 10:12.691
- Why are you staring at me?
- Because I'm worried about you,

10:12.857 --> 10:14.776
- that's why.
- Oh, Phoebe, don't start.

10:14.984 --> 10:16.152
No, Piper, something's up.

10:16.319 --> 10:18.363
You're turning down dates
with a guy that you like,

10:18.530 --> 10:20.281
extolling the virtues of convent living,

10:20.448 --> 10:22.784
you've been working double shifts
three times a week.

10:22.992 --> 10:25.411
This is not the Piper I know,
and I'm worried.

10:25.578 --> 10:28.331
Don't be. Everything is fine.

10:28.498 --> 10:30.750
I'd like a glass
of Calera Jensen, please.

10:32.085 --> 10:33.545
'93, if you've got it.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.047
Josh.

10:36.631 --> 10:38.341
Good start. You recognize me.

10:39.801 --> 10:41.427
What are you doing here?

10:41.761 --> 10:42.971
- Phoebe.
- What?

10:43.888 --> 10:45.807
This is such a surprise.

10:46.015 --> 10:48.184
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

10:48.351 --> 10:50.853
Do you wanna get all hot
and sweaty with me?

10:51.729 --> 10:53.314
I'm kidding.
I'm on my way to the gym,

10:53.481 --> 10:55.733
and I thought since I can't
buy you dinner,

10:55.900 --> 10:59.237
maybe we could work out together.

11:01.447 --> 11:02.782
I'll be right back.

11:04.450 --> 11:06.077
So will I.

11:07.954 --> 11:09.705
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Why?

11:09.872 --> 11:11.958
A little exercise, a nice steam,

11:12.124 --> 11:14.293
a trip to the juice bar.
What could it hurt?

11:14.502 --> 11:15.920
My job. I'm at work.

11:16.087 --> 11:17.421
I can't just up and leave.

11:17.630 --> 11:20.925
Okay. Well, I could babysit for you
while you're gone.

11:21.133 --> 11:23.010
The restaurant? I don't think so.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.970
It's not like anything's gonna happen.

11:25.137 --> 11:27.139
You said it yourself,
you're closed until dinner.

11:27.598 --> 11:30.935
Come on. It is just a workout.

11:31.102 --> 11:32.520
The worse-case scenario:

11:32.686 --> 11:35.481
You're in better shape by the time
you check into the nunnery.

11:38.317 --> 11:41.362
Okay, fine. But only
if it will get you to shut up.

11:41.570 --> 11:42.863
- It will. Okay.
- Good.

11:46.742 --> 11:49.286
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

11:56.418 --> 11:58.170
You sure you've never ridden
a horse before?

11:58.337 --> 12:00.297
I've never even seen a horse before.

12:00.506 --> 12:02.132
Except on television.

12:02.341 --> 12:03.967
Well, you're a natural at it.

12:04.134 --> 12:06.053
Keep your grades up,
you can come riding again.

12:06.261 --> 12:08.055
Promise?

12:09.473 --> 12:11.433
A spider! Kill it!

12:11.767 --> 12:13.060
Oh, no.

12:13.227 --> 12:15.979
He's just trying to find
his way home, that's all.

12:16.396 --> 12:19.650
Besides, all life is precious
to God, you know?

12:20.025 --> 12:23.570
Here. Don't be afraid.

12:23.779 --> 12:25.405
Trust me.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.993
There you go.

12:34.706 --> 12:37.709
Why don't you take him into the stable
and set him free. I'll be right in.

12:40.879 --> 12:42.172
You're braver than me.

12:42.714 --> 12:44.508
How'd you find me?

12:44.716 --> 12:47.385
Father Austin told me
that you would be here.

12:47.552 --> 12:48.929
We need to talk.

12:49.596 --> 12:51.056
Look...

12:51.264 --> 12:52.516
Prue.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.477
Prue.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.855
If you're worried about my telling
anybody your secret, you don't have to.

12:59.064 --> 13:00.190
It's safe with me.

13:00.398 --> 13:02.067
Yeah, well, that's good to know.
But why?

13:02.234 --> 13:05.737
I mean, most people would be pretty
freaked out if they saw what you saw.

13:05.946 --> 13:07.197
I'm not like most people.

13:07.405 --> 13:09.324
Yes, I know.

13:09.491 --> 13:11.618
Most people aren't attacked
by warlocks.

13:13.745 --> 13:15.413
I don't wanna talk about that.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.123
Okay.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.043
Hi, just gonna borrow this
for a minute.

13:20.251 --> 13:22.003
Sure. Go ahead.

13:47.779 --> 13:49.656
Hey, wait up.

13:55.036 --> 13:57.288
Keep your grades up, maybe
you can come riding again too.

13:57.497 --> 13:59.374
Oh, you promise?

14:00.750 --> 14:01.959
Who are you, anyway?

14:02.168 --> 14:04.587
Oh, well, that's not fair.
I asked you first.

14:05.254 --> 14:07.965
I'm not quite sure I know
the answer to that one, I'm afraid.

14:08.174 --> 14:10.343
Well, as far as I can see,
you're too good to be true.

14:10.510 --> 14:12.720
I mean, church volunteer,
great with kids.

14:12.887 --> 14:14.472
Loves horses, spiders.

14:14.639 --> 14:15.932
Not all spiders.

14:16.140 --> 14:18.809
- Hate black widows.
- That's a good thing.

14:22.188 --> 14:23.648
What?

14:23.814 --> 14:25.816
Brendan, you're in danger.

14:25.983 --> 14:27.193
Serious danger.

14:27.860 --> 14:29.654
I know.

14:30.571 --> 14:32.198
Wait. How do you know?

14:33.908 --> 14:35.284
I can help you.

14:36.035 --> 14:37.661
No, you can't.

14:37.828 --> 14:40.706
You're lucky they didn't hurt you.
They could've killed you last night.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.583
Who could've? Who are they?

14:43.209 --> 14:45.586
Doesn't matter.

14:45.753 --> 14:48.047
After tomorrow,
I'll be safe from them forever.

14:48.255 --> 14:51.800
- What happens tomorrow?
- I become a priest.

14:58.974 --> 15:00.309
A little sweat.

15:00.517 --> 15:03.854
A nice steam. A trip to the juice bar.

15:04.021 --> 15:06.523
I'm gonna kill you, Phoebe.

15:07.983 --> 15:11.028
- How you doing?
- Great. Never better.

15:11.236 --> 15:12.988
Well, you're looking great.

15:13.489 --> 15:15.365
I can't believe
you've never done this before.

15:15.908 --> 15:17.993
Yeah, well, believe it.

15:18.202 --> 15:19.828
Want me to keep you company
on the way up?

15:20.037 --> 15:24.249
Oh, no. I'll meet you down there.

15:24.458 --> 15:25.834
All right, then. See you in a few.

15:35.594 --> 15:37.012
Gotcha.

15:37.220 --> 15:38.680
Talk about falling for a guy.

15:49.107 --> 15:51.610
I can't believe I said that.

15:53.028 --> 15:54.738
<i>- Hello, Quake.
- Phoebe.</i>

15:55.655 --> 15:57.157
Hey, Piper.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.533
How's it going?

15:58.742 --> 16:00.619
Bad, real bad.

16:01.036 --> 16:03.413
Really? Why?
Cliffs Notes version will do.

16:03.622 --> 16:05.123
You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.042
Because we shared the look.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.169
<i>- The look?
- Yeah. You know,</i>

16:09.336 --> 16:11.588
<i>the look that precedes the kiss.</i>

16:11.796 --> 16:13.381
You look at each other
at the same time,

16:13.548 --> 16:15.258
you smile at each other
at the same time.

16:16.468 --> 16:19.220
Well, that's great.
I knew you'd have a good time.

16:19.429 --> 16:22.557
No, Phoebe. This is exactly
what I did not want to happen.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.769
Is that water I hear running?

16:27.103 --> 16:30.273
Water? I don't know.
Maybe just a little.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.860
You know, just out of curiosity,

16:34.027 --> 16:36.404
if you were the water shutoff valve,

16:36.613 --> 16:37.822
where would you be?

16:43.620 --> 16:45.163
Where'd you get the phone?

16:46.664 --> 16:47.707
Phoebe just called.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.543
There's an emergency
at the restaurant. I gotta go.

16:54.797 --> 16:57.467
I had a really great time. Thanks.

16:57.675 --> 16:59.177
You're welcome.

17:16.402 --> 17:17.612
Prue.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.787
- Dear God!
- Call 911. Hurry.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.801
Prue, wait. You don't understand.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.845
- Don't I?
- I didn't hurt Father Austin.

17:43.054 --> 17:44.221
I found him like that. I swear.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.223
Before or after
you turned into a warlock?

17:46.432 --> 17:48.809
After. When I saw what they did
to him, I was crazed.

17:49.018 --> 17:50.394
The rage turned me into a warlock.

17:50.561 --> 17:53.314
Look, don't believe me. I don't care.

17:53.481 --> 17:55.149
Just at least let me call
the paramedics.

17:55.316 --> 17:57.526
Please. Don't let him die.

17:59.153 --> 18:00.487
I'm begging you.

18:00.863 --> 18:02.364
They've already been called.

18:02.573 --> 18:04.366
Thank you.

18:04.575 --> 18:07.870
Do you actually expect for me
to believe that you're a good warlock?

18:08.078 --> 18:10.205
No. There's no such thing.

18:12.875 --> 18:14.835
I can explain it to you if you let me.

18:15.002 --> 18:17.880
I can make you understand.
I won't hurt you.

18:19.381 --> 18:20.924
I need your help.

18:21.341 --> 18:24.720
- For what?
- To stop the other warlocks.

18:24.887 --> 18:26.513
To stop my brothers.

18:39.860 --> 18:42.696
Got an eyewitness. A nun.

18:42.863 --> 18:46.742
Saw someone she ID'd
as Brendan Rowe run from the scene.

18:46.908 --> 18:50.704
Apparently Mr Rowe lives
in the rectory behind the church.

18:51.246 --> 18:52.664
You all right?

18:52.831 --> 18:55.042
No, I'm not.

18:55.709 --> 18:59.463
Father Austin's my priest.
He gave me my first communion.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.966
What kind of animal would do this?

19:07.179 --> 19:10.223
- Wanna follow him to the hospital?
- No.

19:11.099 --> 19:13.476
I wanna catch the scum
that did this to him.

19:19.316 --> 19:22.068
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:24.446 --> 19:26.489
You should've called me.

19:26.656 --> 19:29.325
I know, I know.

19:29.492 --> 19:31.536
But you had a good time, right?

19:31.703 --> 19:33.204
Unfortunately.

19:33.413 --> 19:35.415
Do you confuse yourself
when you do that?

19:36.583 --> 19:38.376
It's just...

19:38.543 --> 19:40.336
I don't know, Phoebe. It seems like

19:40.503 --> 19:42.630
every guy I've liked lately has been

19:42.797 --> 19:47.635
either a warlock, a ghost
or otherwise unavailable, like Leo.

19:47.802 --> 19:50.555
I was just trying to save myself
some grief with Josh.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.557
But Josh is available.

19:52.724 --> 19:54.434
And human too.

19:54.601 --> 19:56.185
I think.

19:58.104 --> 20:00.231
I just don't wanna be
disappointed again.

20:00.398 --> 20:01.983
I'm tired of falling for the wrong guy,

20:02.150 --> 20:04.277
human or supernatural.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.529
Well, I am sorry.

20:06.696 --> 20:09.032
If I had known that you wanted
to take a dating hiatus,

20:09.198 --> 20:10.575
I wouldn't have pushed so hard.

20:12.243 --> 20:14.620
Are you mad at me?

20:15.997 --> 20:17.582
No.

20:17.748 --> 20:19.375
I'm grateful.

20:20.126 --> 20:24.839
- Yeah?
- You followed my instincts.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.758
I don't know what I would do
without you.

20:30.136 --> 20:33.639
A warlock naturally comes from two
warlock parents, like Greg and Paul do.

20:33.806 --> 20:37.685
But they're just my half brothers.
I had a different mother.

20:37.852 --> 20:42.606
- A human mother?
- Yes, a wonderfully human mother.

20:43.524 --> 20:45.026
So then we have something
in common.

20:45.192 --> 20:46.819
My father was human.

20:47.111 --> 20:50.322
Difference is, he came from good.
Mine came from pure evil.

20:50.990 --> 20:52.742
Descended from
an ancient warlock line,

20:52.908 --> 20:55.703
intent on furthering the Rowe Coven.

20:55.870 --> 20:59.123
Three brothers destined to become
the most powerful force for evil

20:59.290 --> 21:00.416
the world has ever known.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.668
The evil Charmed Ones.

21:02.960 --> 21:06.130
Only, I went into hiding.
I didn't wanna be a part of it.

21:06.297 --> 21:07.631
I wanted to break the chain.

21:07.798 --> 21:10.134
Make amends
for all my family's done.

21:10.301 --> 21:12.678
By becoming a priest?

21:13.387 --> 21:16.098
Embracing God in that way
is the only way to lose my power,

21:16.265 --> 21:18.851
my warlock nature, forever.

21:19.435 --> 21:23.022
And with it, keep the Rowe Coven
from ever being.

21:24.857 --> 21:27.609
I've been at war with myself
all my life, Prue.

21:27.776 --> 21:29.945
Running from the evil inside of me.

21:30.154 --> 21:31.780
I guess it finally caught up.

21:31.989 --> 21:35.826
- You can fight it. Fight them.
- No, I can't.

21:36.034 --> 21:38.328
My brothers are too powerful.
They're relentless.

21:38.495 --> 21:41.707
They'll keep hurting the people
I care about till I give in.

21:41.874 --> 21:43.500
They'll even hurt you.

21:45.043 --> 21:47.254
I can take care of myself.

21:47.421 --> 21:49.339
It's you that I'm worried about.

21:49.548 --> 21:51.133
Don't worry about me.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.010
I know what I have to do.

21:54.720 --> 21:58.223
I have to kill my brothers before they
trick me into killing somebody else.

21:58.432 --> 22:00.684
You'll have to follow me
to their place.

22:00.892 --> 22:03.228
And then you and your sisters
will have to kill me.

22:09.401 --> 22:12.112
- Everything's ready.
- Good.

22:12.821 --> 22:14.573
He's coming.

22:15.991 --> 22:17.826
This is amazing.

22:17.993 --> 22:20.370
Just at his approach,

22:20.537 --> 22:22.372
my power quickens.

22:22.539 --> 22:26.001
It's as if I'm reaching out for him

22:26.167 --> 22:27.919
for completion. Do you feel it too?

22:35.927 --> 22:37.345
Brother.

22:37.554 --> 22:40.515
- I'm here to kill you, Greg.
- Well, I'm glad.

22:40.682 --> 22:43.393
Anything less, I'd be disappointed.

22:44.686 --> 22:46.646
But first...

22:48.857 --> 22:51.192
...you're gonna need this.

22:56.114 --> 22:58.783
It's okay, Brendan. Take it.

23:03.955 --> 23:07.292
I know this wasn't your doing, Paul.
But I'm gonna have to kill you too.

23:07.959 --> 23:10.294
But me first.

23:18.594 --> 23:20.763
Yes. Just come on.

23:20.972 --> 23:23.349
You're feeling it now.
Come on, that's it!

23:23.516 --> 23:24.851
You're almost there.

23:25.017 --> 23:27.270
Feel that pull in your gut,
in your blood?

23:27.436 --> 23:31.649
This is us. This is your birthright.

23:41.367 --> 23:43.160
What the hell?

23:43.327 --> 23:44.787
You smell it, Brendan?

23:44.954 --> 23:47.123
It's damp, intoxicating.

23:47.707 --> 23:49.750
But you need to kill.

23:50.793 --> 23:52.586
Oh, yes. That's it.

23:53.963 --> 23:55.756
That's it.

23:57.049 --> 23:58.509
We got here as soon as we could.

23:58.717 --> 24:00.344
<i>We didn't have time to get
the Book of Shadows.</i>

24:00.511 --> 24:02.346
Yeah, I don't wanna
have to kill Brendan too.

24:02.555 --> 24:04.849
- You said he's a warlock.
- Yeah, I know he is.

24:05.015 --> 24:07.351
But if we can vanquish his brothers
before he turns,

24:07.518 --> 24:08.936
we might be able to save him.

24:09.144 --> 24:10.479
Okay.

24:10.688 --> 24:12.731
One clean thrust,

24:12.898 --> 24:14.358
and you're both at peace.

24:14.567 --> 24:16.277
Finish it.

24:21.156 --> 24:22.825
Brendan, no.

24:27.121 --> 24:28.372
Three witches.

24:28.580 --> 24:32.000
We can't defeat them without Brendan,
and we haven't got him yet.

24:40.050 --> 24:42.553
- It's okay, you're safe.
- No, don't take the blindfold off.

24:42.761 --> 24:45.681
- She'll see us. We'll call for help.
- Prue, he's a warlock.

24:45.889 --> 24:47.307
I know.

24:54.106 --> 24:56.858
- Minimal traffic.
- CSU needs the photos.

24:57.025 --> 24:58.068
I'll give it to them.

24:58.235 --> 25:01.655
Victim's a little shaken up,
so let's give her some air, okay?

25:02.823 --> 25:04.741
- Here you go, inspector.
- Thanks.

25:04.908 --> 25:07.035
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.955
You okay to talk a little more?

25:11.540 --> 25:13.750
Yeah.

25:13.917 --> 25:15.585
I had just gotten to my car,

25:15.752 --> 25:19.798
and I was loading the groceries
in the back...

25:19.965 --> 25:23.510
...and they just came out of nowhere.

25:23.718 --> 25:26.930
Was this guy, Brendan Rowe,
was he one of them?

25:27.138 --> 25:28.682
No.

25:28.848 --> 25:33.061
But I remember them calling
one of the other ones that.

25:34.145 --> 25:36.898
I was blindfolded, and I think
they drugged me or something,

25:37.065 --> 25:38.984
because the next thing I remember,
I was here.

25:41.945 --> 25:44.155
I felt the tip of the knife.

25:44.322 --> 25:46.616
He was gonna kill me.

25:47.617 --> 25:50.578
- But she made him stop.
- She?

25:51.162 --> 25:53.665
One of the women that came.

25:53.832 --> 25:57.293
Prue. I think her name was Prue.

25:57.460 --> 25:58.670
Thanks.

25:58.837 --> 25:59.879
Stay with her.

26:06.970 --> 26:10.765
Bastards painted an occult symbol
on her chest. A target.

26:10.932 --> 26:12.767
She's lucky to still be alive.

26:12.934 --> 26:15.812
- She ID Brendan Rowe?
- Yeah.

26:15.979 --> 26:17.814
She said two others blindfolded her,

26:17.980 --> 26:20.483
brought her here for him to kill her.

26:21.776 --> 26:23.611
Where are you going?

26:24.445 --> 26:27.615
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this,
once and for all.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.579
Hey, you can sleep in my room,

26:33.746 --> 26:35.498
and I'll sleep with Piper.

26:35.665 --> 26:36.958
Why?

26:37.124 --> 26:38.501
Because Phoebe kicks.

26:38.668 --> 26:41.045
No, I mean, why are you doing this?

26:41.212 --> 26:43.589
Why are you being so kind to me
after what I almost did?

26:43.756 --> 26:45.758
Yeah, but you didn't.
And that's what's important.

26:45.925 --> 26:48.344
You didn't succumb
to your brothers' will.

26:48.511 --> 26:50.680
Only thanks to you.

26:50.846 --> 26:52.139
They had me, Prue.

26:52.306 --> 26:53.849
Right where they wanted.

26:54.016 --> 26:57.186
I mean, I could feel the evil inside
taking over.

26:57.478 --> 27:00.231
It was so strong, so powerful.

27:00.398 --> 27:02.900
If you and your sisters
hadn't come in when you did...

27:03.067 --> 27:05.945
You would've stopped yourself.
You wouldn't have hurt her.

27:06.487 --> 27:09.698
How can you be so sure of me
when I'm not even sure of myself?

27:11.075 --> 27:14.036
Because you're a good person,
Brendan. I've seen it.

27:14.203 --> 27:16.914
At church, in Father Austin's words,

27:17.081 --> 27:19.792
at the stables with that little girl.

27:19.959 --> 27:22.044
Your good side is much stronger
than your evil side.

27:22.211 --> 27:24.922
You just have to keep fighting
until the ordination in the morning.

27:25.923 --> 27:27.132
And then you're home free.

27:29.134 --> 27:32.763
And we are gonna make sure
that you get there on time.

27:40.229 --> 27:43.190
How many more temptations
must I endure?

27:58.622 --> 28:00.332
Okay, I'm gonna go. Night.

28:01.124 --> 28:02.793
Night.

28:06.713 --> 28:09.549
He was about to drive a knife
into that woman's heart.

28:09.758 --> 28:12.177
- You couldn't have missed that, right?
- I didn't.

28:12.344 --> 28:15.555
I saw Brendan
not plunge the knife into her.

28:15.722 --> 28:17.808
Yeah, that's because
we stopped him.

28:18.016 --> 28:19.142
Then why isn't she dead?

28:19.351 --> 28:20.393
Because we showed up.

28:20.602 --> 28:22.270
No, because we followed him.

28:22.437 --> 28:24.689
Because last night,
Phoebe had a premonition

28:24.898 --> 28:25.941
of Brendan being attacked.

28:26.107 --> 28:28.485
That makes him the innocent
that we're supposed to protect.

28:28.652 --> 28:31.196
Not necessarily. I mean,
maybe we were directed to him

28:31.404 --> 28:33.448
so we could save the real innocent,
the woman.

28:33.657 --> 28:36.326
Which we did, and now you've brought
her would-be killer,

28:36.534 --> 28:39.412
a warlock, into our house. How do you
know he won't try to kill us?

28:39.579 --> 28:41.039
That's what warlocks do.

28:41.539 --> 28:44.167
He's not just a warlock,
he's human too.

28:47.087 --> 28:51.132
Okay, look. Piper, remember when the
Wendigo turned you into a monster?

28:51.508 --> 28:54.344
The struggle that you went through?
And, Phoebe,

28:54.511 --> 28:56.596
what about when the shadow
turned you evil?

28:56.805 --> 28:59.265
What you went through
to fight him off just to stay good.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.936
If anybody could relate
to what Brendan is going through,

29:03.102 --> 29:04.521
I would think it would be you two.

29:04.938 --> 29:08.816
He has worked so hard for so many
years to overcome his dark side,

29:08.983 --> 29:11.152
his brothers. And he's so close.

29:15.281 --> 29:17.700
What if...? What if you're wrong?

29:17.867 --> 29:21.287
What if he crosses over
and joins his brothers?

29:21.496 --> 29:23.373
Well, then, they become
the evil Charmed Ones,

29:23.539 --> 29:25.291
and it's too late to stop them.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.834
I know.

29:28.586 --> 29:32.215
Look, I can't explain it.

29:32.924 --> 29:35.092
I'm just following my instincts.

29:35.259 --> 29:36.761
And they've never
led me wrong before,

29:36.928 --> 29:39.764
at least not when I've really
listened to them.

29:41.265 --> 29:44.435
Guys, if you can't believe in him,

29:44.602 --> 29:46.896
can you please at least
believe in me?

29:49.815 --> 29:51.817
Okay. Well,
if we're gonna help Brendan

29:51.984 --> 29:55.446
get to his ordination, we have to
figure out a way to stop his brothers.

29:55.613 --> 29:57.490
They're definitely
gonna be there waiting.

30:00.368 --> 30:01.786
Who could that be?

30:01.994 --> 30:03.829
Brendan's brothers?

30:04.038 --> 30:07.333
Something tells me they're not exactly
the ringing-the-bell types.

30:13.422 --> 30:15.257
- Andy.
- Hey, Prue, you feeling lucky?

30:15.424 --> 30:17.384
Because I'm here to do you
a big favour.

30:17.551 --> 30:20.054
I'm gonna forget that I can place you
at the scene of a crime.

30:20.221 --> 30:22.890
If you tell me where I can find
Brendan Rowe.

30:23.432 --> 30:25.476
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

30:25.684 --> 30:28.062
I'm talking about justice
for Father Austin.

30:28.228 --> 30:29.271
Ever hear of him?

30:31.690 --> 30:34.068
What's the matter? Need more time
to work on your story?

30:34.276 --> 30:37.154
- Andy.
- Sorry, but all bets are off on this one.

30:37.363 --> 30:40.240
A priest, my priest, was viciously
attacked at his own church.

30:40.407 --> 30:45.162
This is a guy who dedicated
his entire life to doing only good.

30:46.121 --> 30:47.956
Then a young mother
was kidnapped

30:48.123 --> 30:50.959
and almost sacrificed at an altar.

30:51.168 --> 30:54.880
Now, I can place Brendan Rowe
at both scenes of the crime.

30:56.089 --> 31:01.428
And the female victim
hearing your name at the last one.

31:01.637 --> 31:03.180
And believe it or not,

31:03.347 --> 31:04.806
I don't care why you were there.

31:05.515 --> 31:08.226
All I care about is who tried to kill
Father Austin.

31:08.894 --> 31:11.563
I wish that I could help you.

31:13.190 --> 31:15.317
Piper, what about you?

31:15.525 --> 31:17.027
You wanna tell me where he is?

31:18.028 --> 31:22.032
We're not hiding any criminals here,
Andy, if that's what you're asking.

31:25.202 --> 31:26.828
Fine.

31:27.037 --> 31:29.789
Father Austin's in intensive care.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.167
If he dies, it's first-degree murder.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.169
And if I find out you were
somehow involved,

31:34.377 --> 31:36.796
I won't be able to look the other way
this time, Prue.

31:50.268 --> 31:52.312
I've never seen him like that before.

31:52.604 --> 31:54.022
Can you blame him?

31:55.106 --> 31:56.816
I hope you're right
about Brendan, Prue.

31:58.985 --> 32:02.989
<i>Fratrem nostrum reconciliate</i>

32:03.198 --> 32:07.076
<i>Conventum nostrum consummate</i>

32:07.285 --> 32:11.372
<i>Fratrem nostrum reconciliate</i>

32:11.581 --> 32:15.418
<i>Conventum nostrum consummate</i>

32:15.627 --> 32:19.631
<i>Fratrem nostrum reconciliate</i>

32:19.839 --> 32:23.968
<i>Conventum nostrum consummate</i>

32:24.135 --> 32:28.014
<i>Fratrem nostrum reconciliate</i>

32:55.249 --> 32:56.500
He should've been here by now.

32:56.667 --> 32:59.170
- I told you the spell wouldn't work.
- We've still got time.

32:59.337 --> 33:00.755
I'm telling you, he can't be taken.

33:00.921 --> 33:02.715
His mother's blood
is too strong in him.

33:02.882 --> 33:05.301
Then we will have to kill him.

33:05.468 --> 33:07.386
I won't let that happen.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.555
You won't have a choice.

33:12.266 --> 33:14.685
- Brendan.
- The spell brought you here.

33:14.852 --> 33:18.063
But the rest you're gonna have to do
on your own, little brother.

33:18.272 --> 33:20.441
- I understand.
- Do you really?

33:20.649 --> 33:23.152
I feel only my power
reaching out to yours,

33:23.319 --> 33:26.155
and yours, to complete our triangle.

33:27.489 --> 33:30.284
All it takes is the life of a mortal.

33:31.994 --> 33:35.414
And then your initiation is complete.

33:35.623 --> 33:38.709
I'm afraid it's gonna take a bit more.

33:38.876 --> 33:41.628
We need proof
that you have truly turned.

33:46.467 --> 33:48.302
To complete the Rowe Coven...

33:49.011 --> 33:50.888
...you need to sacrifice a witch.

33:54.141 --> 33:55.309
Prue.

34:24.129 --> 34:25.797
Where'd he go?

34:26.882 --> 34:29.634
Probably to the rectory to get ready.

34:29.842 --> 34:31.136
But you're not sure.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.889
- No, I'm not.
- What are you gonna do?

34:35.306 --> 34:36.475
I'm gonna go find him.

34:37.641 --> 34:40.187
- Wake up Pheebs, okay?
- I'm up.

34:40.353 --> 34:42.230
<i>Wanna know what
the Book of Shadows says</i>

34:42.397 --> 34:43.523
about the Rowe Coven?

34:43.690 --> 34:45.734
- Go.
- It's not good.

34:45.900 --> 34:49.362
Ever since the tenth century,
each generation has grown stronger.

34:49.529 --> 34:53.158
Nobody can find a spell or a weapon
that can stop them.

34:53.366 --> 34:55.368
Some days you just shouldn't
get out of bed.

34:55.534 --> 34:57.787
Let's just hope that the power of three
can beat them.

34:58.121 --> 35:00.415
Unless it's already
three against three.

35:04.294 --> 35:05.962
You sure you don't want us
to go with you?

35:06.129 --> 35:08.882
- If he's turned, he'll kill you.
- No, he won't. I can talk to him.

35:09.048 --> 35:13.178
Look, I'll yell for help if I need it.
I just need a minute alone with him.

35:20.226 --> 35:21.853
Hello, Prue.

35:22.478 --> 35:24.022
Hi.

35:24.522 --> 35:27.525
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, sure.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.736
Why?

35:29.902 --> 35:31.696
Worried about me?

35:33.823 --> 35:37.452
A little. Especially since
you left this morning without a word.

35:37.660 --> 35:40.246
Yeah, well, big day.
I wanted to get a jump on it.

35:40.413 --> 35:44.083
Yeah. Shouldn't you
be getting ready?

35:46.544 --> 35:48.796
I am ready, Prue.

35:49.922 --> 35:51.632
They got to you, didn't they?

35:51.841 --> 35:53.217
Look at this place.

35:53.384 --> 35:56.345
It's hardly furnished. Dresser...

35:56.512 --> 35:59.181
...crucifix, bed.

35:59.473 --> 36:02.518
Will this be my life, to meditate?

36:02.685 --> 36:05.062
To shut out the world?

36:05.229 --> 36:08.983
- Have your brothers been here?
- Mortify the flesh?

36:10.192 --> 36:11.986
They put a spell on me,

36:12.570 --> 36:15.364
to make me see
your mortal body only.

36:16.907 --> 36:18.701
Something to kill.

36:23.122 --> 36:24.874
And I see it.

36:28.252 --> 36:29.420
You can fight it, Brendan.

36:29.628 --> 36:31.338
No, it's okay, don't.

36:36.760 --> 36:37.928
So this is it?

36:38.137 --> 36:39.930
You kill me or I kill you?

36:40.139 --> 36:41.682
Prue.

36:41.849 --> 36:44.351
Everything that you've worked for.

36:44.518 --> 36:47.062
All the good that you've done
and still can do.

36:47.980 --> 36:50.357
All for nothing, all lost?

36:51.233 --> 36:52.901
I don't believe it.

36:53.068 --> 36:54.862
I don't believe
that this is the real you.

36:55.738 --> 36:59.032
No, Brendan, wait. You're good.
You can't kill me.

36:59.741 --> 37:01.743
It's not who you are.

37:01.952 --> 37:05.122
It's not why Father Austin
believes in you.

37:30.689 --> 37:31.982
Did I hurt you?

37:32.816 --> 37:34.776
No, I'm okay.

37:36.236 --> 37:37.988
Forgive me.

37:39.823 --> 37:42.409
I wasn't worried. Were you worried?

37:46.788 --> 37:48.623
It's clear.

37:53.962 --> 37:55.964
You betrayed us, little brother.

37:57.173 --> 37:58.842
I'm very disappointed.

37:59.301 --> 38:00.802
Leave them out of this, Greg.

38:01.011 --> 38:02.345
You're protecting witches now?

38:03.138 --> 38:05.348
- You make me sick.
- Prue?

38:05.557 --> 38:06.808
Now.

38:10.729 --> 38:14.023
No, not this time. I'm ready for you.

38:17.318 --> 38:20.989
- But family first.
- Yeah? Come and get me.

38:21.197 --> 38:22.448
Greg, wait!

38:22.657 --> 38:24.868
Brendan, don't let them turn you.
Don't use your powers.

38:25.076 --> 38:28.371
Give him a chance.
It's not too late, Brendan.

38:28.580 --> 38:30.164
You can still join us.

38:30.373 --> 38:34.168
You're either with us
or you are against us.

38:34.335 --> 38:35.712
Then I'm against you.

38:36.087 --> 38:37.964
Then you will die.

38:43.511 --> 38:44.887
Damn you, Brendan.

38:45.096 --> 38:47.223
No, Greg.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.142
Damn you.

38:57.233 --> 38:58.860
No.

39:13.958 --> 39:16.168
I'm sorry.

39:16.335 --> 39:17.712
I'm not.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.050
It's time.

39:23.968 --> 39:26.429
Yeah, I know.

39:29.223 --> 39:30.891
After all these years,

39:31.058 --> 39:34.311
after everything I've given up
to get here...

39:34.478 --> 39:37.231
...the sacrifice never seemed greater
than it does right now.

39:43.737 --> 39:45.406
Tell me about it.

40:29.783 --> 40:32.327
You know, if you're ever
gonna lose a guy...

40:32.494 --> 40:34.413
...it might as well be to the big guy.

40:34.579 --> 40:36.123
Yeah.

40:54.975 --> 40:58.103
- What can I get you, Prue?
- Hi, Bobby. The usual.

40:58.270 --> 40:59.938
- You got it.
- Thanks.

41:00.105 --> 41:01.564
Hey.

41:01.731 --> 41:03.191
Hi.

41:03.358 --> 41:04.818
Still mad at me?

41:04.985 --> 41:07.153
Listen, Prue, I'm sorry
about how I acted earlier.

41:07.946 --> 41:10.615
Andy, please.
You don't have to apologize.

41:10.824 --> 41:12.826
I know how close you are
to Father Austin.

41:13.868 --> 41:15.703
I've known you
a long time, remember?

41:15.912 --> 41:18.289
Yeah. I remember.

41:19.541 --> 41:22.710
Actually, I just came from the hospital.
The doctors think he's gonna be okay.

41:22.919 --> 41:24.504
I'm glad to hear that.

41:24.838 --> 41:28.383
And he said it wasn't Brendan Rowe
who attacked him, it was his brothers.

41:28.550 --> 41:30.969
I suppose you don't know
where I might be able to find them.

41:31.177 --> 41:33.513
No. Thanks.

41:33.721 --> 41:37.725
But I have a feeling that you're not
gonna be able to find them anywhere.

41:37.934 --> 41:39.394
Really.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.562
Now, I wonder how
you might know that.

41:44.983 --> 41:46.984
Never mind, I think I already know.

41:47.944 --> 41:51.197
Well, I'd better get back to work.
I just wanted to stop by.

41:51.739 --> 41:53.491
I'm glad you did.

42:05.294 --> 42:08.214
Well, you're not handcuffed.
That's a good sign.

42:08.422 --> 42:10.591
Depends on who's cuffing you.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.218
I'm joking.

42:12.885 --> 42:14.679
I wonder how he knew
that I would be here.

42:14.887 --> 42:17.974
Are you kidding? We're always
at Quake after we vanquish warlocks.

42:18.140 --> 42:19.684
Either here or at home.

42:21.978 --> 42:24.063
Oh, there's Josh.

42:24.980 --> 42:28.234
Oh, man.
That guy cannot take a hint.

42:28.859 --> 42:32.154
Piper, this is my fault.
I'm the one who pushed you on him.

42:32.321 --> 42:33.906
So I will handle this, okay?

42:34.073 --> 42:35.866
It's okay. I called him.

42:39.328 --> 42:42.414
I've decided it's time to try
and work through my fears

42:42.581 --> 42:44.917
and trust my instincts.

42:45.125 --> 42:46.460
Always a good thing to do.

42:46.669 --> 42:49.380
- Especially when they're that cute.
- Yeah.

42:49.588 --> 42:51.548
Piper. Hey.

42:51.715 --> 42:53.092
I'm a little surprised you called.

42:53.259 --> 42:55.469
I thought maybe you were
mad at me or something.

42:55.636 --> 42:58.389
No, I just had to go to church.

42:58.555 --> 42:59.765
Table for two?

43:00.808 --> 43:03.102
Yes, you.

43:08.690 --> 43:12.361
So maybe I didn't do
such a bad thing after all.

43:12.528 --> 43:15.656
I'd say helping her get over
always falling for the wrong guy

43:15.823 --> 43:17.658
is a pretty good thing.

43:17.825 --> 43:20.285
Now maybe you can help me with it.

43:20.452 --> 43:22.579
Yeah. It's not fair,

43:22.746 --> 43:26.083
Iosing such a catch like Brendan
to the priesthood.

43:26.250 --> 43:27.834
God's got all the studs.

43:28.001 --> 43:30.337
Well, at least he's not
a warlock anymore.

43:30.504 --> 43:33.423
And at least Piper is not a nun.

43:33.590 --> 43:36.009
- Right?
- Right.
