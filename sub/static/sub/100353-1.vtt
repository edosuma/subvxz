WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(ominous atmosphere music)

00:20.454 --> 00:22.654
- [Preacher] Then I saw the Lamb

00:22.656 --> 00:25.290
open up one of the seven seals.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.696
(wind howls)

00:30.698 --> 00:33.932
And I heard one of the
four living creatures

00:33.934 --> 00:36.468
say with a voice like thunder.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.105
Come.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.074
Look.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.343
And behold.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.450
There was a white horse.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.121
The one riding on it had a bow.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.160
And a crown was given to him.

01:05.633 --> 01:09.201
He went out as a conqueror,
so he might conquer.

01:15.209 --> 01:18.911
For the great day of
their ride has come.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.517
And who is able to stand?

01:31.358 --> 01:34.359
(rock music)

01:34.361 --> 01:35.994
- [Antonio] Another
one, Gabriel?

01:36.831 --> 01:37.729
- Give me two.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.369
You know those guys
I'm playing pool with?

01:45.840 --> 01:46.872
- Been here every day this week.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.140
Haven't we all?

01:49.910 --> 01:50.776
Big tippers.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.812
So I don't ask questions.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.721
- Can I get my usual?

02:03.591 --> 02:05.224
Gabriel, my man.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.458
Where you been?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.659
- Warrick.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.295
- I see you're on the
non-sleeping diet.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.898
Jesus Christ man,
you look like shit.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.700
- Isn't this a little
outside your territory?

02:14.702 --> 02:15.934
- You my boss now?

02:15.936 --> 02:18.070
I've had calls this
side of town all week.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.839
- [Antonio] Dirty
martini, no vodka.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.441
- That's disgusting.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.542
- I'm on the clock, pal.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.218
Hey, I got something
for you, Antonio.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.321
¶ Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba ¶

02:36.323 --> 02:38.123
- I bought a six pack
off of you last week.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.325
- New flavor, new
formula, just try it.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.002
- It's decent.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.337
- I'll put you down
for three dozen.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.605
- It's not in the budget.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.442
- Whoa.

02:57.444 --> 03:00.279
Those are some serious
shitkickers, pal.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.513
Steel-toe?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.215
- You wanna find out firsthand?

03:03.217 --> 03:05.450
- (laughs) No dude, I'm good.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.351
I'm good.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.287
See this?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.391
Is my business.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.525
You ever heard of it?

03:13.527 --> 03:14.826
- Got Guts?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.395
No.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.997
- Number one demon
cleaning crew in the state.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.900
- Why do demons
need to be cleaned?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.702
(laughs)

03:23.704 --> 03:25.337
- That's funny, man.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.005
Here's what it is, see.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.575
It's for cleaning up
demon guts after they die.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.145
- Demons don't die.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.880
- Is that a fact?

03:34.882 --> 03:35.814
- Yeah.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.349
- Well that man right there?

03:37.351 --> 03:39.251
He would disagree with you.

03:39.253 --> 03:42.421
He has killed over one
thousand demons himself.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.157
- You hunt demons?

03:45.159 --> 03:46.425
- No.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.161
- Well he's retired
now, but he used to.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.529
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.097
That's a very expensive bottle.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.765
85 one dollar bills.

03:53.767 --> 03:54.967
- Watch yourself.

03:54.969 --> 03:55.767
You know who you're
dealing with?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.302
(glass shatters)

03:57.304 --> 03:59.171
- Oh now come on, that's $15
shy of a hundred dollar bill.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.542
- 85, okay.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.443
Here's 85.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.246
- That's $3 man.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.815
Motherfucker.

04:09.817 --> 04:10.682
Come on, boys.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.820
- I turn my back for a second

04:14.822 --> 04:16.455
and you change the whole table?

04:18.092 --> 04:19.091
- Now look.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.594
I don't know where you're from.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.096
Frankly, I don't give a damn.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.366
But where I'm from,
we act like a man,

04:27.368 --> 04:29.801
and when it's time to
pay up, you pay up.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.303
- Yeah?

04:31.305 --> 04:33.472
Well here's a little something
to take home to your wifey.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.242
Sort him out, boys.

04:37.244 --> 04:40.479
(rock music picks up)

04:57.798 --> 05:02.467
(loud crunch)
(screams)

05:09.009 --> 05:10.008
(slow clapping)

05:10.010 --> 05:11.677
Bravo, bravo, bravo.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.214
(music dies down)

05:16.216 --> 05:19.785
- Got your quarter
right here, Spinal Tap.

05:21.922 --> 05:25.424
(tense atmosphere music)

05:31.632 --> 05:34.366
(demonic groan)

05:38.706 --> 05:41.073
- See you haven't
lost your touch.

05:41.075 --> 05:41.973
- Michael.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.876
What are you doing here?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.945
- Haven't seen you
in 10 years, brother.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.581
No hi, how are you?

05:49.583 --> 05:50.582
Nice to see you?

05:51.585 --> 05:52.417
- Hi.

05:52.419 --> 05:53.652
How are you?

05:53.654 --> 05:54.953
What the hell are
you doing here?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.689
- I came to bring
you back to Zersch.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.091
- No.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.592
- Hear me out.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.294
- There's no way in hell I'm
going back to that place.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.897
- Eve would want you to do this.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.167
- What the fuck
did you just say?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.071
- Hold on!

06:13.073 --> 06:15.173
- You must have a death wish.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.175
- Eve's the reason I'm here.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.677
- What are you talking about?

06:18.679 --> 06:19.611
- Put me down.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.746
- Why?

06:20.748 --> 06:21.980
- I have to show you something.

06:21.982 --> 06:22.814
- What?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.649
- I have to show you.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.388
Jesus, Gabriel.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.290
You wrinkled my shirt,
this is Italian silk.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.191
- Show me.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.095
- Let's go inside.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.166
These appeared yesterday.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.568
- The four angels.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.037
- Got on the first plane
to come and find you.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.472
- How do I know those are real?

06:47.474 --> 06:48.907
- Come on.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.809
The marks have been appearing
on me since I was eight.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.811
You know what they look like.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.280
- I don't wanna go
back into that world.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.748
- What about Eve's prophecy?

06:57.551 --> 06:59.151
- Eve lost a lot of blood.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.986
She didn't know
what she was saying.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.456
- You really believe that?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.191
- I don't believe
anything anymore.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.393
Especially anything
coming out of your mouth.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.596
- Well I assume you
still believe in science.

07:13.367 --> 07:14.566
- What's that?

07:14.568 --> 07:15.634
- I've been tracking
demon movements

07:15.636 --> 07:17.102
with my team back in Europe.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.839
Started taking on a
concentrated formation.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.508
(door slams)

07:23.510 --> 07:24.743
- Whoa!

07:24.745 --> 07:25.977
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.346
What the hell happened here?

07:28.348 --> 07:29.281
- What the hell?

07:29.283 --> 07:30.248
Get out of my way, little man.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.251
(pained groan)

07:33.253 --> 07:35.387
- Whoa.

07:35.389 --> 07:36.721
What was that?

07:36.723 --> 07:38.356
- That was a demon.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.559
- Well no shit, Dick Tracy.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.462
Who let this nimrod
prattle over the farm huh?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.197
- Always a pleasure, Warrick.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.866
- So where's Antonio?

07:50.938 --> 07:52.137
Aw man.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.674
- The guys playing
pool were demons.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.776
And they weren't exploding,
they were combusting.

07:57.778 --> 08:01.279
- Well that explains
why there's no guts.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.816
But this is not good for
the demon cleaning business.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.052
(gasps)

08:07.054 --> 08:08.520
(Warrick laughs)

08:08.522 --> 08:10.522
- What did I tell you?

08:10.524 --> 08:13.091
(laughs) What I tell you?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.693
What I tell you, it works.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.794
- What happened?

08:15.796 --> 08:16.995
- You don't wanna know.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.634
- Hannah.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.247
- I'll be right in.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.862
- Gabriel.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.498
Oh my god, I thought
I'd never see you again.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.533
- Well here I am.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.268
- What are you doing here?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.044
- Hello Hannah.

09:08.849 --> 09:09.748
- Michael.

09:11.084 --> 09:11.983
- How are you?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.788
- Where did you get that?

09:18.091 --> 09:19.958
- This just saved someone
from a demon attack.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.829
What is it?

09:24.831 --> 09:27.232
- It's a pulse revival elixir.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.334
- Meaning?

09:29.336 --> 09:30.869
- It's a herbal compound
that, when activated,

09:30.871 --> 09:33.638
mimics the chemical reaction
to jumpstart the heart.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.140
- Like a defibrillator.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.741
- Exactly.

09:36.743 --> 09:37.976
- What's the activator?

09:37.978 --> 09:39.678
- It's a chemical
that forms when

09:39.680 --> 09:42.180
demon poison enters
the bloodstream.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.615
Are you two hunting again?

09:43.617 --> 09:44.482
- No.

09:46.987 --> 09:47.886
Not yet.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.322
- What's going on?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.258
- The angels have landed.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.894
- You can't be serious.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.263
- Did you not see them coming?

09:59.132 --> 10:01.499
- No, I don't scry anymore.

10:03.971 --> 10:04.869
- They're here.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.273
- How do you know?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.374
- They marked me.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.215
- Okay.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.351
So what do you need from me?

10:19.353 --> 10:21.419
- We want you to come
to Europe with us.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.989
We need to find them
before the demons do.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.291
- You want me to come with you?

10:26.293 --> 10:27.192
- We need you.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.395
- How can you trust me?

10:32.833 --> 10:33.732
Okay.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.600
I'm ready.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.335
- Are you sure?

10:38.171 --> 10:41.606
(tense atmosphere music)

10:49.016 --> 10:49.881
Hannah.

10:50.884 --> 10:51.783
(ghostly scream)

10:51.785 --> 10:52.617
Hannah!

10:52.619 --> 10:54.653
(gasps)

10:56.123 --> 10:57.522
- The demon.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.423
Is at the square.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.396
If it wasn't for my vision,
Eve would still be here.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.032
- Mommy?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.036
- Hi honey.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.605
I am almost done, have you
finished your homework?

11:14.408 --> 11:16.041
- Who's that?

11:16.043 --> 11:18.309
- This is Gabriel and Michael.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.245
They are very old
friends of mine.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.782
This is my daughter Ivy.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.317
- Hi.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.719
- Baby, why don't
you grab your things

11:27.721 --> 11:28.953
and I'll get ready to leave.

11:28.955 --> 11:29.788
- Okay.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.689
- Okay.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.664
When are you going?

11:39.666 --> 11:41.032
- We leave tonight.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.000
We have to move quickly.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.135
- I can't just leave her.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.537
- [Gabriel] What
about her father?

11:46.940 --> 11:47.972
- He's not around.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.609
- Is there anyone else?

11:51.611 --> 11:52.477
- My mother.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.880
- This is an opportunity to give

11:55.882 --> 11:58.183
your daughter a life
free from demons.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.719
She needn't live
her life in fear.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.488
- I don't know.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.624
- I can assure you she'll
be safe while we're gone.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.860
I'll assign a team to
stand guard 24 hours.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.996
- Is that really necessary?

12:13.266 --> 12:15.567
- If it makes you feel
more secure, then yes.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.505
We can pick you up after Ty.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.940
- Ty's going?

12:21.942 --> 12:22.841
- Of course.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.009
- I don't know.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.911
I need to think about it.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.146
- [Ivy] Mommy.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.117
- It was really good
to see you, Gabriel.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.387
Goodbye, Michael.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.962
- Why did you tell
her Ty was going?

12:45.065 --> 12:45.997
- Because he will.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.966
- We haven't talked to him yet.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.234
- Minor detail.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.869
We'll get him at
his club tonight.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.437
- It's all your fault.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.404
- What?

12:53.406 --> 12:54.873
- She's still angry at you.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.542
I told you not to get
involved in the first place.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.376
- It's fine.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.210
- No.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.745
It's not fine.

13:00.747 --> 13:01.646
We need Hannah.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.815
- She'll come around.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.817
- You don't know that.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.355
- Where are you going?

13:10.357 --> 13:11.256
- Nowhere, I'll
meet you at Ty's.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.999
- You know Gabriel,
sooner or later

13:21.001 --> 13:22.967
we have to come to
some kind of conclusion

13:22.969 --> 13:24.602
about these conversations.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.139
What are you so hesitant about?

13:29.709 --> 13:30.775
- I don't trust him.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.846
- Yeah, that makes sense,

13:34.848 --> 13:39.250
but that was also a
really long time ago.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.886
- He had one job.

13:41.888 --> 13:44.289
To keep Eve safe, and he
couldn't even handle that.

13:44.291 --> 13:48.893
- Yeah, but sometimes
you have to turn around

13:48.895 --> 13:52.831
and give somebody
another chance.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.200
- Why would I?

13:55.202 --> 13:56.734
- Wouldn't he do that for you?

13:57.604 --> 13:58.803
He's family.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.371
- No.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.141
Just because we have the same
father doesn't make us family.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.144
Eve was my family.

14:07.747 --> 14:11.049
- All these years
with all this anger.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.817
Don't you wanna
put it behind you?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.387
- I've learned to
live with the anger.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.488
Why change now?

14:18.859 --> 14:20.792
- Seems like you
oughta do something.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.729
What do you have to
gain by staying here?

14:25.799 --> 14:28.533
More drinking, more
boozing, more gambling.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.335
More isolation.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.036
No sense of resolve.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.405
- I'm content with that.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.307
- Are you?

14:38.845 --> 14:42.580
Why don't you try to
explore the other side?

14:44.517 --> 14:45.416
- Fine.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.721
Let's say he's telling
the truth and I go.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.222
The angels have landed.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.559
We failed in our mission to
keep the demons contained.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.295
How would we even stand a
chance against the angels?

14:58.932 --> 15:00.932
- You have to have
faith in yourself.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.169
Sometimes small steps
are the only way.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.610
Say hello to my little friend.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.778
- Yeah, no.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.046
No.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.148
You tried that on me
and it didn't work.

15:17.150 --> 15:17.982
- [Balthazar] It didn't work?

15:17.984 --> 15:18.883
- No.

15:20.654 --> 15:21.619
- You still smoke?

15:24.391 --> 15:25.623
(chuckles)

15:25.625 --> 15:26.891
- I know how this works.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.893
- I guess maybe you do then.

15:30.096 --> 15:30.995
Close your eyes.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.699
I'm gonna count backwards
from three to one.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.467
Three.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.203
Two.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.739
One.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.010
You can open your eyes now.

15:49.716 --> 15:50.782
- Nothing's changed.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.117
- How do you know?

15:54.854 --> 15:56.421
You gotta keep your eyes open

15:56.423 --> 15:58.222
and you have to face your fears.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.994
Or things are
never gonna change.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.700
(techno pop music)

16:11.037 --> 16:12.704
- He'll be in the back.

16:12.706 --> 16:13.638
- Where were you?

16:14.407 --> 16:15.974
What held you up?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.575
- You're lucky I'm here at all.

16:26.019 --> 16:30.121
- Oh you did not just
walk into my club.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.557
Stop.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.326
These guys right here?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.861
They are my boys!

16:36.863 --> 16:38.363
Talking about blast
from the past!

16:38.365 --> 16:39.931
Good to see you guys.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.634
- Nice place you got here Ty.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.170
- Not too shabby huh?

16:47.574 --> 16:50.675
I'm opening one up in
New York this fall.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.844
Franchising, baby.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.779
Hey, got my own
energy drink too.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.154
- All these years perfecting
demon daiquiri has paid off.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.689
- Oh no man, this
shit won't kill you.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.357
It gives you a mean buzz though.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.628
- Maybe it's time to get back
into the daiquiri business.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.869
- Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

17:17.871 --> 17:19.437
I thought you retired.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.973
That's why your team broke up.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.009
- The angels have landed.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.081
- Are you sure?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.315
You seen them?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.117
- Not yet.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.585
Are you ready to jump back in?

17:36.689 --> 17:37.588
- Damn.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.367
- So are you in?

17:51.638 --> 17:53.337
- Let's do this shit.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.672
The team is back.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.573
Come on.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.708
Fuck this shit.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.676
- Let's go.

18:02.248 --> 18:06.150
(tense acoustic guitar music)

18:21.634 --> 18:23.601
- Everything all right?

18:26.840 --> 18:27.738
- Balthazar?

18:31.244 --> 18:32.777
You're not real.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.679
You're a hallucination.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.181
- Maybe you're seeing me
'cause you wanna see me.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.584
- Why would I wanna see you?

18:39.586 --> 18:42.453
- Because you're seeing other
things that aren't real,

18:42.455 --> 18:45.656
so you want me to
make sense of it.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.226
- I don't know what's real
and what's not anymore.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.027
- That's because your
eyes are opening.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.629
You're finally seeing clearly.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.832
- What the hell
does that even mean?

18:56.136 --> 18:57.568
- That's all up to you pal.

18:58.705 --> 18:59.604
- Gabriel.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.811
- When'd you get the
stained glass window in?

19:06.813 --> 19:09.480
- Ages ago when I renovated
the second floor, why?

19:10.984 --> 19:11.849
- No reason.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.886
- Come on.

19:14.888 --> 19:16.621
I wanna introduce
you to my team.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.993
(monks chanting)

19:27.734 --> 19:30.601
- [Hannah] The Zotian monastery.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.770
- What are we doing here?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.572
- You'll see.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.375
(monks chanting)

20:05.705 --> 20:07.605
Guys, this is Dominic.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.892
- Wow.

20:27.894 --> 20:28.960
That's cool.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.066
- Welcome.

20:37.971 --> 20:41.606
(ominous atmosphere music)

20:56.389 --> 20:59.423
(tense atmosphere music)

20:59.425 --> 21:00.825
Guys, I'd like to
introduce you to Lola.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.560
Hunter and tracking specialist.

21:04.897 --> 21:08.633
- This screen is tracking
the movement of the demons.

21:08.635 --> 21:12.603
On the left side is the demon
demographic from last week.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.472
This is how they are today.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.707
- They've shifted
since yesterday.

21:16.709 --> 21:20.244
- We know some of these demon
troops serve the angels.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.512
We just don't know which ones.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.447
- How do the demons know
where they're going?

21:23.449 --> 21:24.982
- They don't.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.486
It's a magnetic force.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.254
Newton's the name, folks!

21:30.256 --> 21:33.724
- Newton's a specialist of
metallurgy and magnetism.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.992
- Say what?

21:34.994 --> 21:37.128
- What does that have to
do with demon formation?

21:37.130 --> 21:39.664
- (chuckles) That's
a good question.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.365
Good question.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.600
Remember this one?

21:42.602 --> 21:43.467
Huh?

21:45.371 --> 21:46.203
- I love that--

21:46.205 --> 21:47.705
- Hey, don't touch!

21:49.575 --> 21:51.108
Let's get back to business.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.478
Let's say the particles on
this board are demons right?

21:54.480 --> 21:55.446
Dirty demons.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.648
These other ones are angels.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.818
These are your meteorites.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.153
- So the demons are drawn to the

22:02.155 --> 22:04.622
chemical composition
of the angels.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.824
- You a scientist?

22:06.826 --> 22:07.725
- Alchemist.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.728
- Traditional or new age?

22:10.730 --> 22:12.697
- Newton, can we stay on track?

22:12.699 --> 22:14.098
- Track, right, that's right.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.835
Okay, so when the angels
landed, the meteorites also hit.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.103
- Is that a coincidence?

22:19.105 --> 22:20.237
- Coincidence?

22:20.239 --> 22:21.739
(chuckles) No
coincidence with that.

22:21.741 --> 22:25.943
- We think it's
configuration of tactics.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.345
- Preparing for battle.

22:27.347 --> 22:30.047
- So the angels and the
meteorites are interchangeable.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.349
- Correct.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.750
- That's where you come in.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.086
- Right.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.320
- What's your speciality?

22:36.322 --> 22:38.055
- Hannah's a psychic.

22:38.057 --> 22:38.923
- Psychic?

22:39.992 --> 22:42.226
- I'm not psychic exactly.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.728
I have visions.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.263
- So you see things.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.233
What sort of things?

22:49.235 --> 22:50.634
- Places, events.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.636
Sometimes they are symbolic.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.272
- Have you seen
anything like this?

22:55.274 --> 22:56.607
Huh?

22:56.609 --> 22:57.475
- These are new.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.144
- Yeah.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.045
These things have--

23:01.047 --> 23:02.346
(screams)
(dramatic sting)

23:02.348 --> 23:04.382
(laughs)

23:04.384 --> 23:05.916
- Now listen.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.918
When they bite, they puncture.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.521
If they puncture, you're dead.

23:11.324 --> 23:12.857
- Not necessarily.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.125
We saw someone come back to life

23:14.127 --> 23:16.060
after taking one of
Hannah's elixirs.

23:16.062 --> 23:16.961
- Elixir?

23:18.931 --> 23:21.065
- What does that mean?

23:21.067 --> 23:24.268
- Some demons have
disappeared off the grid.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.169
That's odd.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.705
- We better get moving.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.474
- What are you doing?

23:30.476 --> 23:32.843
(science equipment falls)

23:32.845 --> 23:33.744
Oh yeah?

23:35.515 --> 23:36.347
Here you go.

23:36.349 --> 23:37.848
Back at ya.

23:37.850 --> 23:38.916
You like that?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.484
All right.

23:40.486 --> 23:43.554
(chuckles)

23:43.556 --> 23:47.024
(tense atmosphere music)

23:49.395 --> 23:51.695
(knocking)

23:52.598 --> 23:53.431
- Can I come in?

23:53.433 --> 23:54.265
- Hi.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.166
Sure.

23:56.502 --> 23:58.035
- What's that?

23:58.037 --> 24:01.172
- This is a time release
herbal stimulant.

24:01.174 --> 24:02.440
When released it counteracts

24:02.442 --> 24:04.175
the sedation I go
under when I scry.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.811
Breaks me out of my trance.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.280
Controls how long
I stay under for.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.283
- Why do you have that?

24:13.386 --> 24:15.152
- I realized the longer
I stayed in my visions

24:15.154 --> 24:17.354
the more inaccurate they became.

24:18.724 --> 24:21.826
I think I got lost in them,
so they became convoluted.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.360
- You figure that
out for yourself?

24:23.362 --> 24:26.096
- It took me two years
to develop the formula.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.300
Still a work in progress.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.768
- Why'd you do it?

24:30.770 --> 24:32.136
I thought you stopped scrying.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.075
- I did.

24:38.076 --> 24:38.808
But I wanted to make
sure if I ever had

24:38.811 --> 24:42.112
to do it again, it would
be as accurate as possible.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.416
And less dangerous.

24:45.418 --> 24:47.852
- Are you sure you're
okay to do this?

24:49.722 --> 24:50.688
- I'm sure.

25:02.001 --> 25:05.636
(ominous atmosphere music)

25:40.506 --> 25:43.307
(ghostly scream)

25:47.146 --> 25:50.814
(ominous atmosphere music)

25:56.756 --> 25:57.955
- You two stand guard.

25:57.957 --> 25:58.856
- Copy.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.908
- Does this look
familiar Hannah?

26:19.745 --> 26:20.644
- No.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.191
(ghostly screams)

26:49.475 --> 26:53.043
(film projector whirring)

27:11.530 --> 27:13.063
- Did you see that?

27:13.065 --> 27:13.964
- What?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.467
- Something's over there.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.203
- Lola, you picking anything up?

27:22.842 --> 27:24.408
- No, nothing.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.211
- Something is out there.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.946
- You two stay back.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.051
- I'm going this way.

27:36.656 --> 27:37.888
- What's wrong?

27:37.890 --> 27:39.256
- It's getting colder.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.426
- Yeah, you're right.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.095
- That's not good.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.543
(door slams)

28:16.228 --> 28:19.530
(otherworldly screech)

28:31.043 --> 28:33.577
(dramatic sting)

28:33.579 --> 28:36.213
- I always loved it when
you got rough with me.

28:38.884 --> 28:39.783
- Valentina.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.087
- Hello, darling.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.356
What a pleasant surprise.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.725
- I wouldn't say pleasant.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.527
And I'm not surprised.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.631
- What are you doing here?

28:59.972 --> 29:02.339
Last I heard you've
gone (mumbles).

29:02.341 --> 29:03.841
- What are you talking about?

29:11.217 --> 29:12.783
- Denounce your faith.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.754
Turn in your demon hunting hat.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.022
Throw in the towel.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.825
- There's a difference between

29:21.827 --> 29:25.195
not hunting demons
and protecting them.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.101
- But is there really?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.570
- What is this place?

29:36.041 --> 29:37.074
- A safe house.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.577
- Safe house for demons.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.412
Isn't that cute.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.414
- Not as cute as
your ragtag team

29:44.416 --> 29:46.216
you've got going on down there.

29:49.755 --> 29:50.587
- Where are the demons?

29:50.589 --> 29:52.589
- Out to lunch.

29:53.859 --> 29:54.758
- Okay.

29:55.795 --> 29:56.760
Where's the angel?

29:57.963 --> 29:59.429
- I have no idea...

30:01.433 --> 30:03.667
What you're talking about.

30:05.805 --> 30:06.870
- Goddammit.

30:08.507 --> 30:12.142
(ominous atmosphere music)

30:21.420 --> 30:22.319
- Hey.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.155
Can I see your gun?

30:25.157 --> 30:26.356
- No.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.457
- No?

30:28.360 --> 30:29.426
What do you mean no?

30:29.428 --> 30:30.994
- You have your own gun, man.

30:33.766 --> 30:34.832
- That makes sense.

30:35.768 --> 30:37.301
(otherworldly shriek)

30:37.303 --> 30:38.168
Shh.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.207
Let's go.

30:49.448 --> 30:50.280
- Michael!

30:50.282 --> 30:52.115
(demonic growling)

30:52.117 --> 30:54.384
(gunshots)

30:55.554 --> 30:59.156
(suspenseful action music)

31:09.435 --> 31:10.701
(dramatic sting)

31:10.703 --> 31:13.170
(neck snaps)

31:15.241 --> 31:17.174
(mischievous laughter)

31:17.176 --> 31:18.642
- Uh-uh.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.178
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

31:21.180 --> 31:24.214
I have many more of those
I can release on a whim.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.551
- Valentina.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.320
- Been a while, friends!

31:30.322 --> 31:32.456
As much as I love a reunion,

31:32.458 --> 31:34.925
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.061
- Where is the angel?

31:39.465 --> 31:41.298
- I told Gabriel already.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.168
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.371
- Come on, Valentina.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.739
Hannah had a vision.

31:48.741 --> 31:52.209
- Oh, and how are those
working out for you?

31:53.445 --> 31:55.178
- I'm gonna ask
you one last time.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.715
Where is the angel?

31:58.717 --> 32:00.350
- I told you.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.185
I protect demons.

32:02.187 --> 32:03.654
Not angels.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.089
Have a look yourself.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.826
- I could put an end
to this right now.

32:09.828 --> 32:11.094
- You could.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.829
But you and your
friends wouldn't get

32:12.831 --> 32:15.065
five feet away from here
with my demons on guard,

32:15.067 --> 32:19.002
so we are in a little
predicament now, aren't we?

32:19.004 --> 32:20.304
- You wanna do that?

32:20.306 --> 32:22.139
- I wouldn't be so
sure if I were you.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.708
You have another option.

32:25.744 --> 32:26.710
- What's that?

32:26.712 --> 32:28.512
- Get rid of these losers.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.347
And join me.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.416
- Right.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.217
- Together, we'll
be unstoppable.

32:36.855 --> 32:38.855
You don't know what
you're missing.

32:38.857 --> 32:40.057
- I'll take my chances.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.860
- There's nothing here!

32:45.965 --> 32:46.897
- Let's go!

32:55.541 --> 32:56.974
I'll be back for you.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.609
- Don't make promises
you can't keep.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.580
- What did V have to say?

33:03.582 --> 33:04.481
- Nothing much.

33:05.718 --> 33:07.451
- Who was that?

33:07.453 --> 33:09.286
- That was Valentina.

33:09.288 --> 33:13.123
She used to be part of our
team until she switched sides.

33:13.125 --> 33:16.159
- You failed to see
her in your delusion?

33:16.161 --> 33:17.027
- Vision.

33:17.029 --> 33:17.928
- Same thing.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.731
- Why didn't your sensors
pick up the demons?

33:20.733 --> 33:22.332
- The sensors are thermal.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.969
Below certain temperatures they
don't even show up as great.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.372
- Could've told us
that a little earlier.

33:28.374 --> 33:32.042
(ominous atmosphere music)

33:36.148 --> 33:37.447
(knocking)

33:37.449 --> 33:38.348
Come in.

33:43.789 --> 33:44.688
- Hey.

33:48.494 --> 33:52.496
I was wondering, did you see
Valentina in your vision?

33:52.498 --> 33:53.463
- No.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.132
I'd have told you guys if I did.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.300
- Right.

33:58.704 --> 33:59.536
- Why?

33:59.538 --> 34:01.004
What's wrong?

34:01.006 --> 34:03.840
- I've been looking for her
since she left the team.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.308
- Yeah, well maybe she sensed

34:05.310 --> 34:06.843
we were here and summoned us.

34:07.980 --> 34:09.079
- Could she do that?

34:09.081 --> 34:10.614
- I don't know.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.916
It's been a while since I've
done this and now I'm rusty.

34:15.687 --> 34:16.953
Why are you really here?

34:18.457 --> 34:19.956
- I want to talk.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.459
- Not interested.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.195
- Please, let me explain.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.899
- Just do me a favor
and stay away from me.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.682
- I still love you, Hannah.

34:47.352 --> 34:48.552
- Yeah, well...

34:50.255 --> 34:51.621
I don't love you.

34:52.891 --> 34:56.626
(dramatic atmosphere music)

35:14.213 --> 35:16.680
- What are you doing?

35:16.682 --> 35:18.215
- You?

35:18.217 --> 35:19.316
You're here.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.318
Recalibrating the artillery.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.119
- Come again?

35:22.121 --> 35:22.953
- You hear what I said?

35:22.955 --> 35:24.321
- No.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.555
- Recalibrating the
artillery, it's a combination

35:25.557 --> 35:28.558
of human skeleton
and demon interiors,

35:28.560 --> 35:31.294
metallic alloys, in order
to destroy them all.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.534
- Whatever you say man.

35:40.072 --> 35:43.473
Just tell me what to do and
I will get the job done.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.941
What do you think?

35:44.943 --> 35:46.743
- It's not bad.

35:46.745 --> 35:47.611
Yeah.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.950
(screams)

35:55.921 --> 35:57.354
- Fuck!

35:57.356 --> 35:58.221
Fucking shit!

35:59.758 --> 36:02.692
- I told you not
to touch anything!

36:02.694 --> 36:05.562
(laughs)

36:05.564 --> 36:09.099
Listen, listen, it's
fingerprint activated.

36:09.101 --> 36:11.835
You're lucky, you're very lucky.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.870
'Cause the rest of the
people that touch that,

36:13.872 --> 36:15.705
they have paralysis for
the rest of their lives.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.874
(laughs)

36:18.977 --> 36:20.377
You're lucky it's
Dominic's piece.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.711
I have an override.

36:21.713 --> 36:22.546
- Dominic?

36:22.548 --> 36:24.114
- Yes.

36:24.116 --> 36:25.015
- That guy.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.685
That guy really does not
want me touch his weapon huh?

36:28.687 --> 36:29.586
- That's right.

36:32.057 --> 36:32.989
Don't think about it.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.958
Don't even think about it.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.064
- Where did that come from?

36:41.066 --> 36:43.200
I've never seen that.

36:43.202 --> 36:45.502
- Now that's
something I recognize.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.138
That belonged to Gabriel.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.039
- See?

36:49.908 --> 36:50.941
No.

36:50.943 --> 36:51.841
You'll learn.

36:53.178 --> 36:54.444
You'll learn, my friend.

36:56.949 --> 37:00.684
(dramatic atmosphere music)

37:32.184 --> 37:33.083
- Eve.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.187
I'm lost.

37:40.359 --> 37:44.094
(dramatic atmosphere music)

38:01.113 --> 38:02.946
We need to head to Worslock.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.180
- How do you know?

38:04.182 --> 38:05.682
- The angel wasn't
in the theater.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.183
The theater was showing
us which direction to go.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.319
- [Hannah] What do you mean?

38:09.321 --> 38:11.888
- There's a statue pointing
directly towards Worslock.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.624
- The only way to get
there is over Mount Batar.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.860
That trail has been
closed for years.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.194
It's not safe to cross.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.396
- Can't we go across it?

38:19.398 --> 38:22.198
- That would take an
extra day, possibly two.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.733
- We don't have
that kind of time.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.468
- No, it's too dangerous.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.936
- What is this place?

38:26.938 --> 38:29.472
- It's an isolated town
deep in the mountains.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.808
Used to be inhabited
by demons years ago.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.277
- We haven't been there,
but a few hunters have.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.114
- I know a second trail
straight through the mountain.

38:38.116 --> 38:40.450
I haven't used it,
but it's possible.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.418
- Great.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.320
That's what we'll take.

38:43.322 --> 38:44.220
- Michael.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.692
- Pack it in, team.

38:48.694 --> 38:52.162
(tense atmosphere music)

39:17.589 --> 39:19.589
- What's on your staff?

39:21.126 --> 39:22.025
- It's a serpent.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.762
- Why is it there?

39:25.764 --> 39:27.163
- I use it in my rituals.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.133
- [Lola] What kind of rituals?

39:30.135 --> 39:31.101
- Exorcisms.

39:32.671 --> 39:33.870
- You were an exorcist?

39:35.374 --> 39:36.272
- Was.

39:38.276 --> 39:40.744
(screaming)

39:40.746 --> 39:43.580
(bones cracking)

39:44.449 --> 39:47.417
(demonic laughter)

39:48.520 --> 39:50.887
I command you demon,
get out of that body!

39:50.889 --> 39:52.689
I banish you to Hell!

39:55.794 --> 39:57.961
I command you demon,
get out of that body!

40:07.239 --> 40:09.038
- Is that why you become hunter?

40:10.142 --> 40:11.875
To track down the
rest that were free?

40:13.779 --> 40:14.944
- Something like that.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.082
- Where did Ty go?

40:20.218 --> 40:21.418
- He's picking up ammo.

40:30.796 --> 40:34.364
(electricity powers down)

40:35.967 --> 40:37.167
- What's that?

40:38.336 --> 40:39.869
Who's there?

40:39.871 --> 40:40.737
Huh?

40:42.374 --> 40:44.741
(bellowing)

40:45.911 --> 40:47.177
That you demon?

40:48.280 --> 40:49.145
Demon!

40:50.649 --> 40:51.514
Demon!

40:53.351 --> 40:54.317
Demon!

40:54.319 --> 40:57.253
(screaming)
(dramatic sting)

40:57.255 --> 40:58.221
There you are!

40:58.223 --> 41:01.991
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

41:03.261 --> 41:04.694
Yeah, demon, yeah!

41:04.696 --> 41:06.896
Come on, come on.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.631
Let's dance, demon.

41:08.633 --> 41:09.532
Come on.

41:12.037 --> 41:12.936
Yeah yeah.

41:15.407 --> 41:18.508
Hey demon, you
dropped something.

41:18.510 --> 41:22.178
Boom, one punch with
a glass jaw demon!

41:22.180 --> 41:23.546
You ain't nothing.

41:23.548 --> 41:24.681
Nothing, bro.

41:26.184 --> 41:29.652
(tense atmosphere music)

41:48.406 --> 41:49.839
- In approximately three hours

41:49.841 --> 41:52.308
there's a dam we can cross.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.277
Around that time
we'll lose service.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.845
We won't be able to
track any demons.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.815
- Or where they might attack us.

41:58.817 --> 42:02.018
- After that, we can cut
through the mountain.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.287
Worslock's located
somewhere in this canyon.

42:05.490 --> 42:07.690
- There's no exact coordinates?

42:07.692 --> 42:09.192
- No.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.828
Once we get into the canyon we
should be able to locate it.

42:12.664 --> 42:13.863
Ready team?

42:13.865 --> 42:14.998
- Let's do this shit.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.845
(loud rumbling)

42:28.847 --> 42:29.879
The dam!

42:29.881 --> 42:32.682
The dam is about to collapse!

42:32.684 --> 42:35.118
- The only other route is
a trail over Mount Batar.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.786
We'll have to cross
(mumbles) caves.

42:36.788 --> 42:37.820
- No way.

42:37.822 --> 42:39.222
It's way too dangerous.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.457
- We're taking that trail.

42:54.973 --> 42:57.774
(bats squeaking)

43:24.369 --> 43:28.004
(ominous atmosphere music)

44:43.715 --> 44:44.847
- Hold on guys.

44:47.352 --> 44:48.718
I need to stop for a second.

44:48.720 --> 44:49.619
- You okay?

44:50.655 --> 44:51.554
- No.

44:58.830 --> 45:01.030
- I think it's going to storm.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.298
- What do you mean?

45:03.768 --> 45:05.468
- Those are some nasty clouds.

45:07.238 --> 45:10.139
(locusts buzzing)

45:10.141 --> 45:11.841
- Those aren't clouds.

45:11.843 --> 45:14.777
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

45:14.779 --> 45:17.180
(screaming)

45:21.953 --> 45:23.186
- Dominic!

45:23.188 --> 45:24.120
Give me your hand!

45:24.122 --> 45:26.355
Give me your hand Dominic!

45:30.195 --> 45:33.096
(Dominic screams)

45:54.285 --> 45:57.053
- I told you we should
not have come this way.

45:57.055 --> 45:58.721
And none of you would listen.

45:58.723 --> 46:00.490
- Lola, we didn't know.

46:00.492 --> 46:01.324
- No.

46:02.427 --> 46:05.495
Because your vision
didn't mean shit!

46:06.598 --> 46:08.331
And none of you know
what you're doing.

46:12.403 --> 46:14.203
- Where are you going?

46:14.205 --> 46:16.005
- I'm going back.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.807
I'm going around.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.208
- We need to stay together.

46:22.080 --> 46:25.882
- I have never asked to
be part of this team.

46:25.884 --> 46:29.719
And we would've finished this
job without them, Michael.

46:29.721 --> 46:30.753
You messed up.

46:33.558 --> 46:34.457
- Lola!

46:36.494 --> 46:37.727
- Don't follow me.

46:41.299 --> 46:43.599
- [Gabriel] How much longer
'til we get to the other side?

46:43.601 --> 46:45.001
- 23 clicks.

46:45.003 --> 46:48.237
- Let's get going
before it gets dark.

47:09.294 --> 47:13.095
(slow acoustic guitar music)

47:16.367 --> 47:18.167
- There you go, gentlemen.

47:19.070 --> 47:19.902
- Thank you.

47:19.904 --> 47:21.671
- My pleasure.

47:21.673 --> 47:23.406
My name's Jem.

47:23.408 --> 47:24.607
- Hi Jem.

47:24.609 --> 47:28.110
- Let me know what
else I can do for you.

47:32.150 --> 47:33.382
- Ty.

47:33.384 --> 47:34.717
- Sorry.

47:34.719 --> 47:36.786
- Nothing on Worslock.

47:36.788 --> 47:38.187
- What do you mean?

47:38.189 --> 47:39.455
- When I ask he
either shrugs it off

47:39.457 --> 47:40.823
or gives me the runaround.

47:41.860 --> 47:43.426
- He could be
protecting someone.

47:44.462 --> 47:45.595
Maybe they're demons.

47:46.464 --> 47:47.363
- No.

47:47.365 --> 47:48.631
Not that one at least.

47:48.633 --> 47:50.867
Slipped him a daiquiri
and nothing happened.

47:50.869 --> 47:52.435
- Nice work.

47:52.437 --> 47:55.538
- They're scared to talk
because of the demons.

47:57.242 --> 47:59.709
We have to find, hey,
maybe you can help us.

47:59.711 --> 48:01.878
Do you know which
direction Worslock is in?

48:03.047 --> 48:04.847
- Never heard of it.

48:04.849 --> 48:07.016
- Is there a place
to stay in the area?

48:07.018 --> 48:08.551
- There's the inn
around the back.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.186
- Guys, I'm exhausted.

48:10.188 --> 48:11.420
Gonna call it.

48:11.422 --> 48:13.122
I'll check in, see you later?

48:18.630 --> 48:19.762
- Cheers, bro.

48:24.269 --> 48:25.735
- I need a room please.

48:26.871 --> 48:28.404
- [Innkeeper] This
room is good room.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.673
This room is also good room.

48:30.675 --> 48:32.241
- Any room's fine.

48:43.621 --> 48:46.055
- I'm gonna call
it as well, gents.

48:46.057 --> 48:46.989
Sunrise?

48:47.825 --> 48:48.791
- That's the plan.

48:50.194 --> 48:51.093
- Great.

49:07.178 --> 49:08.077
- You all right?

49:13.751 --> 49:14.650
- I'm sad, man.

49:16.187 --> 49:17.386
I miss Dominic.

49:18.523 --> 49:20.589
He was my brother, my soldier.

49:22.927 --> 49:27.697
Should see his face when I put
the demon daiquiri to work.

49:27.699 --> 49:29.065
That was awesome.

49:31.202 --> 49:35.338
It remind me about you and
me, when we started out.

49:35.340 --> 49:37.573
That instant friendship we had.

49:40.445 --> 49:43.279
- Getting ourselves into
trouble all the time.

49:43.281 --> 49:45.381
- And getting us out of it.

49:46.951 --> 49:48.217
- Most of the time.

49:51.889 --> 49:53.055
- What happened?

49:53.057 --> 49:54.290
We had a vision.

49:54.292 --> 49:56.959
How we're gonna
change the world.

49:56.961 --> 49:58.294
Then you disappeared.

50:02.867 --> 50:05.534
I can see the spark inside you.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.137
You still got it.

50:11.642 --> 50:12.842
Order one for me.

50:12.844 --> 50:14.677
Just gonna go to
bathroom, all right?

50:14.679 --> 50:15.578
- Sure.

50:17.348 --> 50:19.749
- I brought you guys some
vodka to warm you up.

50:21.853 --> 50:23.853
Where did your friend go?

50:23.855 --> 50:24.754
- He'll be back.

50:27.492 --> 50:29.091
- You okay?

50:29.093 --> 50:30.092
You look down.

50:32.230 --> 50:34.130
Wanna talk about it?

50:34.132 --> 50:35.031
- I'd rather not.

50:38.503 --> 50:40.136
- Let me see your hands.

50:45.910 --> 50:46.876
Interesting.

50:50.281 --> 50:54.417
Your heart line is very deep.

50:56.821 --> 50:59.155
Your lifeline is weak.

51:01.659 --> 51:06.595
Do you wanna go somewhere
for a more private reading?

51:09.167 --> 51:11.133
- I think I better get going.

51:12.503 --> 51:14.437
- What about your shot?

51:14.439 --> 51:15.438
- I'm good.

51:28.519 --> 51:29.351
- Hey.

51:29.353 --> 51:30.386
Where did my friend go?

51:35.460 --> 51:38.127
I guess it's just
me and you now.

51:43.167 --> 51:44.900
- Be careful.

51:44.902 --> 51:45.901
It's strong.

51:47.004 --> 51:47.870
- Oh yeah?

51:50.308 --> 51:51.207
I love strong.

51:54.979 --> 51:57.146
- I got better
stuff in the back.

51:57.148 --> 51:58.013
- Yeah?

51:59.383 --> 52:01.150
- Want me to show you?

52:01.152 --> 52:02.251
- Please.

52:02.253 --> 52:03.352
Be my guest.

52:14.165 --> 52:15.498
(knocking)

52:15.500 --> 52:18.567
- [Innkeeper] Bring
the fresh towel.

52:23.941 --> 52:26.742
(demonic growling)

52:26.744 --> 52:30.412
(ominous atmosphere music)

52:43.861 --> 52:45.694
(screams)

52:45.696 --> 52:49.665
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

52:52.837 --> 52:55.704
(demonic screech)

53:03.948 --> 53:04.847
- Ty!

53:07.251 --> 53:08.117
(demonic screech)

53:08.119 --> 53:10.586
(Ty screams)

53:19.931 --> 53:22.264
(growling)

53:27.471 --> 53:28.370
- Come on!

53:34.445 --> 53:35.344
Take her!

53:37.481 --> 53:39.882
(zapping)
(screaming)

53:39.884 --> 53:41.650
(growling)

53:41.652 --> 53:43.886
(gunshot)

53:45.523 --> 53:49.158
(ominous atmosphere music)

54:01.172 --> 54:03.472
(knocking)

54:10.848 --> 54:12.715
- I think we found
our first angel.

54:16.754 --> 54:18.053
What happened to you two?

54:18.055 --> 54:19.888
- [Hannah] Don't ask.

54:25.963 --> 54:28.063
- I'm not feeling so good.

54:28.065 --> 54:30.399
I think I need to sit down.

54:33.504 --> 54:36.005
It's a bit hot in here.

54:36.007 --> 54:36.972
- [Hannah] Oh my god.

54:36.974 --> 54:38.340
- [Gabriel] What's happening?

54:38.342 --> 54:40.576
(screams)

54:43.214 --> 54:45.281
(gasps)

54:53.958 --> 54:57.026
He can't (mumbles).

54:57.028 --> 54:59.662
(panicked breathing)

54:59.664 --> 55:02.398
(angry grunts)

55:02.400 --> 55:03.699
- [Michael] You can't kill her!

55:03.701 --> 55:05.000
- Yes I can!

55:05.002 --> 55:06.402
- Ty, stop!

55:06.404 --> 55:07.870
We need them all together.

55:09.407 --> 55:10.806
- Fuck you, psycho bitch!

55:10.808 --> 55:12.875
(spits)

55:15.413 --> 55:17.746
You think I'm gonna get some

55:17.748 --> 55:21.450
fucking crazy angel STD shit?

55:21.452 --> 55:23.319
Huh?

55:23.321 --> 55:24.653
- Probably.

55:24.655 --> 55:25.721
- Goddammit.

55:26.557 --> 55:27.556
- You okay?

55:29.160 --> 55:30.926
- Fucking angel shit!

55:30.928 --> 55:32.161
Psycho bitch!

55:33.130 --> 55:35.331
- I told you it was strong.

55:35.333 --> 55:37.132
(mocking laugh)

55:37.134 --> 55:38.901
- You wanna see
something strong?

55:38.903 --> 55:40.269
I'm gonna show you strong.

55:41.305 --> 55:42.137
You fuck!

55:42.139 --> 55:44.373
(screams)

55:48.746 --> 55:51.013
- Safe to assume
we found Worslock.

55:51.015 --> 55:52.581
- That's definitely the angel.

55:54.618 --> 55:55.517
- Yeah.

55:57.621 --> 56:02.091
Do you think, guys, the angel's
gonna try to kill me now?

56:02.093 --> 56:04.493
- If you weren't
such an easy target.

56:04.495 --> 56:05.728
- Come on man.

56:06.731 --> 56:07.863
- So what now?

56:09.367 --> 56:12.568
- We need to figure out
where the rest of them are.

56:14.438 --> 56:16.338
- Hannah, we'll
leave you to scry.

56:16.340 --> 56:18.307
You tell us what you can.

56:18.309 --> 56:20.342
I'll watch guard
over her in my room.

56:20.344 --> 56:22.111
I need you to get
your strength back.

56:22.113 --> 56:24.513
That's only the first one.

56:24.515 --> 56:25.981
- Sorry man.

56:25.983 --> 56:27.015
I lost it.

56:27.017 --> 56:27.950
- It's all right.

56:32.490 --> 56:34.022
- Come on, you piece of shit.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.365
- Are you gonna be okay?

56:43.367 --> 56:44.266
- Yeah.

56:45.302 --> 56:46.335
I think so.

56:46.337 --> 56:47.603
- You're still bleeding.

56:51.108 --> 56:52.274
- I can do that.

56:52.276 --> 56:53.175
- I know.

56:54.278 --> 56:55.177
I want to.

56:57.348 --> 56:58.414
- Thank you.

56:59.884 --> 57:01.116
- Any time.

57:01.118 --> 57:01.984
- No.

57:05.589 --> 57:07.322
Not for that.

57:07.323 --> 57:09.056
For not listening to me when
I asked you to stay away.

57:13.464 --> 57:15.230
- When I left before, I had to.

57:20.337 --> 57:21.236
For your safety.

57:22.440 --> 57:23.439
Believe me.

57:25.209 --> 57:26.108
- I know.

57:31.348 --> 57:32.981
I better get ready for bed.

57:32.983 --> 57:35.617
- You know where to
find me if you need me.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.119
- Thanks.

57:37.121 --> 57:38.787
- Goodnight Hannah.

57:50.334 --> 57:53.969
(ominous atmosphere music)

58:49.193 --> 58:50.292
(ghostly scream)

58:50.294 --> 58:52.361
(gasps)

59:07.811 --> 59:09.478
- [Balthazar] Don't fall asleep.

59:10.681 --> 59:11.780
- Oh god.

59:11.782 --> 59:12.614
You again.

59:12.616 --> 59:14.283
- Wanna talk?

59:14.285 --> 59:15.183
- Not really.

59:16.720 --> 59:17.986
- Why didn't you take the shot?

59:17.988 --> 59:20.055
- I didn't want to.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.723
- You always want the shot.

59:21.725 --> 59:23.959
- Yeah, well today I didn't.

59:23.961 --> 59:25.360
- Take the shot!

59:26.730 --> 59:27.629
Take the shot!

59:27.631 --> 59:29.164
- No!

59:29.166 --> 59:30.132
(knocking)

59:30.134 --> 59:31.366
- [Hannah] It's Hannah.

59:32.469 --> 59:33.368
- Come in.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.471
- How are you holding up?

59:37.508 --> 59:39.107
- I'm holding.

59:39.109 --> 59:40.242
- Do you wanna switch?

59:40.244 --> 59:42.544
- No, thank you.

59:42.546 --> 59:44.246
Did you scry?

59:44.248 --> 59:45.180
- Yeah.

59:45.182 --> 59:48.083
I saw a marketplace with a well.

59:49.820 --> 59:52.721
- There's some villages
surrounding Worslock.

59:52.723 --> 59:55.123
Did you have Michael
check the tracking?

59:55.125 --> 59:56.024
- No.

59:56.026 --> 59:56.959
Not yet.

59:56.961 --> 59:59.127
- Okay, I'll get with him.

59:59.129 --> 1:00:01.163
You should get some rest.

1:00:01.165 --> 1:00:02.064
- Sure.

1:00:04.068 --> 1:00:04.967
- What's wrong?

1:00:08.772 --> 1:00:09.938
- It's about Ivy.

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:14.876
I found a drawing
Ivy did at school.

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:18.880
It was a a picture of her
dad laying on the ground.

1:00:18.882 --> 1:00:19.781
Dead.

1:00:23.053 --> 1:00:24.186
He had wings.

1:00:26.290 --> 1:00:27.789
- She has visions too?

1:00:27.791 --> 1:00:29.625
- I don't want her to have
to use them like I did.

1:00:29.627 --> 1:00:31.893
I will do whatever it takes

1:00:31.895 --> 1:00:33.629
to make sure that
doesn't happen.

1:00:33.631 --> 1:00:35.263
- You're not in this alone.

1:00:37.835 --> 1:00:38.700
- I know.

1:00:40.270 --> 1:00:42.504
I'm really glad you
came back into my life.

1:00:45.242 --> 1:00:46.108
- Me too.

1:00:51.649 --> 1:00:55.117
(tense atmosphere music)

1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:31.920
- What happened here?

1:01:44.168 --> 1:01:46.468
- It wasn't like this last week.

1:01:50.908 --> 1:01:51.773
- Speak.

1:01:58.816 --> 1:02:00.716
Or do you wanna sleep again?

1:02:04.521 --> 1:02:05.387
Speak!

1:02:07.458 --> 1:02:11.593
- When I got here last week,
there were lots of people.

1:02:13.263 --> 1:02:16.064
There was like a
festival or something.

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:17.099
People dancing.

1:02:19.369 --> 1:02:22.104
And then these two guys
started fighting over a girl.

1:02:23.373 --> 1:02:25.807
Things got violent.

1:02:27.911 --> 1:02:29.177
- What do you mean?

1:02:29.179 --> 1:02:31.880
- Everyone started
fighting everyone.

1:02:31.882 --> 1:02:33.482
- You mean killing each other.

1:03:00.778 --> 1:03:01.977
- This is Isabelle.

1:03:04.448 --> 1:03:05.347
Isabelle.

1:03:10.621 --> 1:03:11.553
- Mama!
(dramatic sting)

1:03:11.555 --> 1:03:12.988
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

1:03:12.990 --> 1:03:14.122
- Put her down!

1:03:14.124 --> 1:03:15.257
Put her down!

1:03:15.259 --> 1:03:17.159
Come on, put her down!

1:03:23.066 --> 1:03:25.967
(muffled fussing)

1:03:29.239 --> 1:03:32.574
- Looks like we found
the second angel.

1:03:41.885 --> 1:03:42.784
- Guys?

1:03:45.322 --> 1:03:47.556
I think we should move,
it's not safe here.

1:03:53.297 --> 1:03:54.196
Come on.

1:04:08.011 --> 1:04:08.910
- Dominic?

1:04:11.782 --> 1:04:13.114
Dominic!

1:04:13.116 --> 1:04:14.749
Oh my god, Dominic!

1:04:14.751 --> 1:04:15.984
How did you...

1:04:17.221 --> 1:04:19.754
I thought you were a goner.

1:04:19.756 --> 1:04:21.189
How did you get here?

1:04:21.191 --> 1:04:22.524
- I don't know.

1:04:24.194 --> 1:04:25.093
- You're shaking.

1:04:25.929 --> 1:04:26.828
You okay?

1:04:27.764 --> 1:04:28.663
- I'm so thirsty.

1:04:29.766 --> 1:04:31.366
- Can I have some water please?

1:04:46.316 --> 1:04:48.250
Have you seen Michael
or the others?

1:04:48.252 --> 1:04:51.386
- No.

1:04:51.388 --> 1:04:56.458
- Looks like there was
some activity here.

1:04:57.995 --> 1:04:59.261
Dom, are you okay?

1:04:59.263 --> 1:05:00.595
Dominic.

1:05:00.597 --> 1:05:02.063
Are you all right?

1:05:02.065 --> 1:05:02.898
Are you okay?

1:05:02.900 --> 1:05:03.865
- I feel dizzy.

1:05:12.542 --> 1:05:14.309
- Would you like
some more water?

1:05:16.980 --> 1:05:20.015
(demonic laugh)

1:05:20.017 --> 1:05:23.418
¶ Night night, sleep tight ¶

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:26.254
(dramatic sting)

1:05:38.302 --> 1:05:41.770
(doll laughs maniacally)

1:05:44.241 --> 1:05:45.440
- Ty.

1:05:45.442 --> 1:05:46.374
- What?

1:05:46.376 --> 1:05:47.842
- [Gabriel] What are you doing?

1:05:47.844 --> 1:05:49.077
- She was hungry, man.

1:05:50.347 --> 1:05:51.913
- I like marshmallows.

1:05:53.450 --> 1:05:54.516
- What?

1:05:54.518 --> 1:05:55.450
Come on.

1:05:55.452 --> 1:05:56.651
You told me not to kill her.

1:05:58.355 --> 1:05:59.821
The girl gotta eat.

1:05:59.823 --> 1:06:01.289
- She's not a girl.

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:02.657
She's an angel.

1:06:02.659 --> 1:06:04.259
A demon angel, remember that.

1:06:05.963 --> 1:06:07.028
- Marshmallows.

1:06:09.199 --> 1:06:10.899
- [Doll] Marshmallow.

1:06:10.901 --> 1:06:12.667
- Keep it in your pants.

1:06:12.669 --> 1:06:14.536
- Marshmallow.

1:06:14.538 --> 1:06:16.037
You're gonna die.

1:06:17.774 --> 1:06:20.175
(screeches)

1:06:22.512 --> 1:06:23.411
- Hey.

1:06:24.481 --> 1:06:25.580
- It's dark.

1:06:25.582 --> 1:06:26.815
- I know.

1:06:26.817 --> 1:06:29.217
Soon as we sat down to
rest you were out cold.

1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:31.119
- I shouldn't have
slept that long.

1:06:31.121 --> 1:06:32.253
- Well you needed it.

1:06:33.290 --> 1:06:35.857
And I needed time to scry.

1:06:35.859 --> 1:06:36.891
- What did it show?

1:06:38.195 --> 1:06:39.461
- Nothing.

1:06:39.463 --> 1:06:41.196
It didn't work.

1:06:41.198 --> 1:06:42.430
- Has that happened before?

1:06:42.432 --> 1:06:45.000
- No, I don't know
what's going on.

1:06:45.002 --> 1:06:47.435
- Hannah, tell him
about your theory.

1:06:48.672 --> 1:06:49.904
- What theory?

1:06:52.876 --> 1:06:56.011
- In the bible, they speak
of the four horsemen.

1:06:57.114 --> 1:06:58.546
They were part of
the seven seals

1:06:58.548 --> 1:07:00.482
that came to signify
judgment day.

1:07:01.618 --> 1:07:04.652
Some say that was to
be the end of days.

1:07:04.654 --> 1:07:06.187
- Four horsemen, four angels.

1:07:07.491 --> 1:07:09.591
- The white horse brought
disease and plague.

1:07:10.594 --> 1:07:13.328
Think of Jem as the white horse.

1:07:13.330 --> 1:07:15.296
- She poisoned Ty.

1:07:15.298 --> 1:07:16.831
- Exactly.

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:20.168
And when we found Isabelle, the
town was killing each other.

1:07:20.170 --> 1:07:21.236
She's the red horse.

1:07:22.339 --> 1:07:23.405
- Who brought war.

1:07:24.207 --> 1:07:25.607
- War.

1:07:25.609 --> 1:07:26.441
Okay.

1:07:26.443 --> 1:07:28.076
What are the next two?

1:07:28.078 --> 1:07:30.278
- Black and pale.

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:31.646
- What's the black one do?

1:07:32.482 --> 1:07:33.314
- Famine.

1:07:33.316 --> 1:07:34.215
- And the pale?

1:07:38.155 --> 1:07:39.054
- Death.

1:07:42.559 --> 1:07:44.993
- Guys, I'm gonna
secure the area.

1:07:46.696 --> 1:07:48.163
- How are you gonna do that?

1:07:49.966 --> 1:07:50.865
- Booby traps.

1:07:54.538 --> 1:07:55.804
- You two get some rest.

1:07:56.873 --> 1:07:58.907
Ty and I will take
turns standing guard.

1:08:00.510 --> 1:08:01.376
- Here.

1:08:02.546 --> 1:08:03.545
Take my long coat.

1:08:05.649 --> 1:08:06.714
- Thank you.

1:08:21.531 --> 1:08:25.200
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:09:04.908 --> 1:09:09.978
- Eve and I will take upstairs.

1:09:10.514 --> 1:09:11.813
Trust me.

1:09:11.815 --> 1:09:14.382
I'll protect her with my life.

1:09:46.416 --> 1:09:47.315
- Eve.

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:49.484
Eve!

1:09:51.121 --> 1:09:54.189
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1:09:54.191 --> 1:09:55.857
- Listen to me.

1:09:55.859 --> 1:09:56.758
Listen.

1:09:58.128 --> 1:10:00.495
Four angels will come.

1:10:00.497 --> 1:10:01.763
- Angels?

1:10:01.765 --> 1:10:02.997
- Dark angels.

1:10:04.601 --> 1:10:05.500
Evil.

1:10:06.303 --> 1:10:07.936
To lead the demons.

1:10:09.706 --> 1:10:11.506
And destroy humanity.

1:10:14.778 --> 1:10:15.677
- Eve.

1:10:17.447 --> 1:10:18.680
- I love you, Gabriel.

1:10:18.682 --> 1:10:19.581
- Morning.

1:10:21.952 --> 1:10:22.850
- Morning.

1:10:23.954 --> 1:10:25.320
You're up early.

1:10:25.322 --> 1:10:28.289
- Yeah, I need to scry again.

1:10:28.291 --> 1:10:29.624
- No luck last night?

1:10:29.626 --> 1:10:31.192
- No, not exactly.

1:10:33.263 --> 1:10:34.395
- It'll come.

1:10:37.267 --> 1:10:38.933
I'm gonna take a walk.

1:10:38.935 --> 1:10:42.036
See what the rest of
the trail looks like.

1:10:42.038 --> 1:10:42.904
- Okay.

1:10:49.546 --> 1:10:53.147
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:11:14.537 --> 1:11:15.503
(demonic growl)
(dramatic sting)

1:11:15.505 --> 1:11:17.572
(gasps)

1:11:25.915 --> 1:11:29.550
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:11:31.655 --> 1:11:34.489
(dramatic sting)

1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:59.480
- What's going on?

1:11:59.482 --> 1:12:02.550
- Isabella Lecter
tried to escape.

1:12:02.552 --> 1:12:04.085
- Gabriel.

1:12:04.087 --> 1:12:06.087
I saw the river in my vision.

1:12:13.163 --> 1:12:14.062
Hi.

1:12:15.065 --> 1:12:17.498
What's your name?

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:18.666
Are you lost?

1:12:20.370 --> 1:12:21.736
Where are your parents?

1:12:25.041 --> 1:12:26.107
- Something's wrong.

1:12:27.911 --> 1:12:29.177
- Poor girl.

1:12:29.179 --> 1:12:30.445
Look at her.

1:12:30.447 --> 1:12:32.613
Seems like she
didn't eat in weeks.

1:12:36.252 --> 1:12:39.721
This doll is a very
very mean doll.

1:12:41.958 --> 1:12:42.957
- Are you hungry?

1:12:42.959 --> 1:12:43.858
I have some food.

1:12:45.795 --> 1:12:46.694
Here.

1:12:49.866 --> 1:12:52.600
(thunder booms)

1:12:54.838 --> 1:12:55.703
Huh?

1:12:56.940 --> 1:13:00.475
I only packed this
yesterday, it's just...

1:13:02.579 --> 1:13:04.345
Ty, stop!

1:13:04.347 --> 1:13:07.115
Don't let her touch you,
don't let her touch anything!

1:13:13.390 --> 1:13:16.891
(tense atmosphere music)

1:14:21.624 --> 1:14:25.259
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:14:36.339 --> 1:14:38.506
(coughs)

1:14:40.610 --> 1:14:42.443
I had a vision.

1:14:42.445 --> 1:14:44.178
I saw the fourth angel.

1:14:44.180 --> 1:14:45.680
- Where?

1:14:45.682 --> 1:14:47.014
- Hannah, where is it?

1:14:48.084 --> 1:14:49.684
- (mumbles).

1:14:49.686 --> 1:14:50.585
In the square.

1:14:51.921 --> 1:14:53.955
There's something else.

1:14:53.957 --> 1:14:57.792
There was a fifth angel.

1:14:57.794 --> 1:15:00.361
- That can't be right.

1:15:00.363 --> 1:15:02.463
- We can't go back there,
the vision wasn't timed.

1:15:02.465 --> 1:15:04.465
Someone could get killed.

1:15:04.467 --> 1:15:05.600
- We're going.

1:15:05.602 --> 1:15:06.501
This is it.

1:15:14.677 --> 1:15:18.346
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:15:59.889 --> 1:16:00.922
You guys stay here.

1:16:01.758 --> 1:16:02.790
I'm going upstairs.

1:16:53.009 --> 1:16:53.841
- Why are you here?

1:16:53.843 --> 1:16:55.009
- I saw the light.

1:16:56.446 --> 1:16:58.412
- The light isn't in the past.

1:16:58.414 --> 1:17:00.181
It's in the future.

1:17:00.183 --> 1:17:01.148
You should go back.

1:17:12.462 --> 1:17:13.628
- Hello Gabriel.

1:17:16.899 --> 1:17:18.532
Here you are.

1:17:18.534 --> 1:17:19.767
Back where you started.

1:17:28.378 --> 1:17:30.778
- It all comes full circle.

1:17:30.780 --> 1:17:31.679
- Yes it does.

1:17:32.548 --> 1:17:34.482
And I must thank
you for circling

1:17:34.484 --> 1:17:37.151
all my angels all
back home to me.

1:17:40.890 --> 1:17:43.090
You should have taken
me up on my offer.

1:17:47.730 --> 1:17:50.531
(choir chanting)

1:18:00.276 --> 1:18:02.777
(doll laughs)

1:18:07.550 --> 1:18:09.383
- Sorry, milady.

1:18:09.385 --> 1:18:10.918
(gasps)

1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:13.154
There's only room for one.

1:18:16.893 --> 1:18:18.693
- What are you doing?

1:18:21.497 --> 1:18:24.732
- The destiny of the demon
takeover was already written.

1:18:26.836 --> 1:18:29.403
You and I were on
the wrong path.

1:18:32.108 --> 1:18:33.674
I must thank you though.

1:18:35.378 --> 1:18:37.945
I couldn't have found
all the angels on my own.

1:18:39.849 --> 1:18:44.919
With them, I can lead
my own demon army.

1:18:45.588 --> 1:18:46.587
And have eternal life.

1:18:48.091 --> 1:18:52.426
I just had to prove
my allegiance to him.

1:18:52.428 --> 1:18:53.327
That was simple.

1:18:55.331 --> 1:18:56.797
I made a sacrifice.

1:18:58.735 --> 1:19:00.601
- I love you, Gabriel.

1:19:01.838 --> 1:19:02.670
- Don't leave me.

1:19:02.672 --> 1:19:03.838
No, don't leave me.

1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:05.439
Eve!

1:19:05.441 --> 1:19:06.440
Eve, don't!

1:19:07.577 --> 1:19:08.476
Eve!

1:19:18.287 --> 1:19:20.121
You killed Eve!

1:19:20.123 --> 1:19:22.857
(loud rumbling)

1:19:24.393 --> 1:19:27.294
(walls crumbling)

1:19:29.365 --> 1:19:33.033
(suspenseful action music)

1:19:44.180 --> 1:19:45.079
- Come on.

1:20:03.666 --> 1:20:04.565
- Come on.

1:20:07.370 --> 1:20:12.439
- [Ty] Come on.

1:20:28.958 --> 1:20:32.126
(loud thunder crack)

1:20:59.889 --> 1:21:02.289
(neck snaps)

1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:06.227
(spits)

1:21:43.466 --> 1:21:46.367
(pained groaning)

1:21:47.603 --> 1:21:51.005
- I don't only have
an army, Gabriel.

1:21:51.007 --> 1:21:52.473
I have a kingdom.

1:21:55.311 --> 1:21:57.111
Welcome home.

1:21:57.113 --> 1:21:58.612
Make yourself comfortable.

1:21:59.615 --> 1:22:01.382
You're here for eternity.

1:22:12.061 --> 1:22:13.527
Go ahead.

1:22:13.529 --> 1:22:14.428
Try me.

1:22:18.501 --> 1:22:19.500
- Let's go!

1:22:49.398 --> 1:22:52.866
- [Eve] I've been
waiting for you.

1:22:52.868 --> 1:22:56.337
(harmonious choir chant)

1:23:27.236 --> 1:23:29.403
- [Balthazar] Sure
sorry about your loss.

1:23:31.107 --> 1:23:32.006
- Thank you.

1:23:32.908 --> 1:23:34.608
Did you know Gabriel?

1:23:34.610 --> 1:23:35.709
- Yeah.

1:23:35.711 --> 1:23:36.777
He was quite a guy.

1:23:37.880 --> 1:23:39.780
We spent a lot of time together.

1:23:39.782 --> 1:23:42.549
He was quite a philosopher,
believe it or not.

1:23:42.551 --> 1:23:43.684
- Philosopher?

1:23:43.686 --> 1:23:44.785
Gabriel?

1:23:44.787 --> 1:23:46.453
- Yeah, he was.

1:23:46.455 --> 1:23:48.455
He had a funny way
of looking at life,

1:23:48.457 --> 1:23:50.257
but not a great way to show it.

1:23:51.427 --> 1:23:52.893
- That's interesting.

1:23:52.895 --> 1:23:53.794
- Yeah.

1:23:56.165 --> 1:23:58.766
Guess I'm now happy that
he's in a better place.

1:24:00.803 --> 1:24:02.403
- What's your name?

1:24:02.405 --> 1:24:03.370
- Balthazar.

1:24:03.372 --> 1:24:05.406
(ominous atmosphere music)

1:24:05.408 --> 1:24:06.540
- I'm Hannah.

1:24:08.110 --> 1:24:09.009
- I know.

1:24:10.346 --> 1:24:11.745
This is for him.

1:24:12.815 --> 1:24:13.714
Okay.

1:24:41.077 --> 1:24:43.510
- [Ivy] Mommy, look!

1:24:43.512 --> 1:24:45.212
- That's beautiful, Ivy.

1:24:45.214 --> 1:24:46.947
Don't go too far sweetheart.

1:24:46.949 --> 1:24:47.848
- Okay.

1:24:52.588 --> 1:24:54.421
- I'll never be dead.

1:24:54.423 --> 1:24:56.523
As long as she's alive.

1:25:05.434 --> 1:25:09.169
(dramatic atmosphere music)
