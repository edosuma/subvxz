00:11.810 --> 00:13.570
Previously on 24

00:14.390 --> 00:15.200
What the hell is this?!

00:15.380 --> 00:17.100
All our screens for the eastern quadrant are locked.

00:17.330 --> 00:18.680
I took out your control units.

00:20.350 --> 00:21.710
I want you to see what we can do.

00:22.610 --> 00:23.960
Get ready to make the course change

00:24.150 --> 00:26.400
Gsa 117, this is northeast three control.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.900
Go ahead, air traffic control.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.980
We have a new runway assignment for you.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.369
Sid, there's another plane landing on four-right.

00:32.689 --> 00:33.590
It crosses three-one-left.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.190
Gsa 117, pull up.

00:35.420 --> 00:36.860
Four-right, pull up.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.560
That was just a warning shot.

00:41.740 --> 00:42.780
Whatever we do next

00:42.960 --> 00:43.960
It'll be the real thing.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.220
Get the module ready.

00:45.990 --> 00:47.710
As promised.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.100
General juma will be pleased.

00:51.770 --> 00:53.480
Perhaps now would be a good time

00:53.480 --> 00:55.200
to make your demands known to president taylor.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.470
Make the preparations.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.860
Your government is about to pay a very steep price for...

00:59.580 --> 01:01.340
...interfering in our affairs.

01:02.110 --> 01:03.870
They assumed my son killed himself

01:04.910 --> 01:06.540
They didn't look deeply enough into anything.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.020
The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.150
You're not going anywhere till I get the truth.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.450
You know who murdered my son.

01:13.970 --> 01:15.280
He killed himself

01:15.510 --> 01:16.950
I'm gonna find what you are hiding.

01:17.230 --> 01:19.480
When I do, God helf you.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.110
You're right. he's not one of ours.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.220
We'll follow him, see if he leads us back to almeida-- dornan.

01:24.450 --> 01:25.800
No, that's not the right move.

01:27.110 --> 01:28.600
You can't bring anyone else into this,

01:29.100 --> 01:30.180
What the hell's going on?

01:30.390 --> 01:31.790
We're following up on a lead.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.460
And I will fill you in if and when we find something.

01:33.870 --> 01:35.490
I do not like this.

01:35.810 --> 01:36.990
I just flat out lied to my boss.

01:37.170 --> 01:38.520
I told you I'd help you find Tony Almeida.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.110
But you're going to have to let me do it my way.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.080
Tony, stop.

01:51.290 --> 01:52.690
Device is gone.

01:52.870 --> 01:54.320
The locator files have been deleted.

01:54.550 --> 01:55.810
Where is it?!

02:01.400 --> 02:02.850
What the hell happened to you?

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.550 --> 02:12.790
Where is almeida now?

02:12.970 --> 02:14.610
He is in transit to FBI headquarters

02:14.610 --> 02:16.310
He'll be formally interrogated there.

02:16.490 --> 02:19.560
I don't understand. Almeida was orchestrating this attack.

02:19.730 --> 02:21.940
If he doesn't have the CIP device, who does?

02:22.750 --> 02:24.730
The FBI has learned that Almeida haned off the device

02:24.730 --> 02:26.720
to someone else,we don't know who.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.250
I may have answer to that question, madam president.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.780
I'm listening.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.040
He's working with the Juma regime.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.360
Approximately 5 minutes ago,

02:35.360 --> 02:37.260
an audio message was routed to the State Department's subnet.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.590
It's from Colonel Dubaku

02:39.770 --> 02:41.140
He's Juma's right-hand man.

02:41.140 --> 02:42.520
He's known as the butcher in Sangala.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.510
Over three hundred thousand people were murdered.

02:44.710 --> 02:46.110
I know who he is.

02:46.970 --> 02:48.550
What did the message say?

02:49.630 --> 02:51.030
You should hear it yourself.

02:52.210 --> 02:53.970
President Taylor

02:54.330 --> 02:56.360
This is Colonel Ike Dubaku.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.500
As you have no doubt confirmed,

03:00.500 --> 03:03.410
the near-collison at JFK international was no accident

03:04.360 --> 03:06.710
We have the CIP device.

03:07.700 --> 03:13.040
We have the capability to kill tens of thousansds of Americans.

03:13.670 --> 03:16.420
And we are prepared to do so.

03:16.650 --> 03:18.940
We demand the complete and immediate withdrawal

03:18.940 --> 03:21.230
of the US naval strike force

03:21.230 --> 03:25.800
to a position west of 23rd meridian by this time tommorrow.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.870
In order to meet this timeline

03:30.590 --> 03:33.890
We require a satellite confirmation within three hours.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.990
that the Carrier Air Wing is in full retreat.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.480
Don't sacrifice your fellow countryman.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.600
Madam president

03:46.140 --> 03:50.700
Allow the people of Sangala to determine their own destiny.

03:51.650 --> 03:54.440
Stand your forces down.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.930
Voice prints an 89% match.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.140
It's Dubaku. There's little doubt.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.690
Looks like your suspicion were correct, madam president.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.450
This is about Africa.

04:03.630 --> 04:07.330
My god. Dubaku should have been tried for war crimes years ago.

04:08.310 --> 04:11.010
Now he's giving us ultimatums.

04:11.010 --> 04:13.720
We can not let this monster hold our country hostage.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.970
Where do we stand on the planes?

04:15.150 --> 04:16.769
They're still 2500 planes in the air

04:16.959 --> 04:19.100
We have got to shore up the firewall

04:19.100 --> 04:21.240
so that the CIP device will be rendered useless.

04:21.430 --> 04:23.910
We now think we can re-engineer the code in six days.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.660
Six days? We don't have the luxury of six hours!

04:26.850 --> 04:28.670
I'm sorry, madam president. But their is no way

04:28.670 --> 04:30.500
we can rebuild the firewall in that timeframe.

04:35.910 --> 04:39.110
I want you to instigate a series of restricted allerts.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.150
Keep it to the first responders only.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.260
I want people to be ready in case we are attacked again

04:43.260 --> 04:45.050
but we don't wanna start panic

04:45.230 --> 04:46.400
Yes, madam president

04:48.520 --> 04:51.290
And gentlemen, Almeida is our only lead.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.750
Make sure the FBI is aware of the demands

04:54.750 --> 04:56.340
and they need to work Almeida from the Africa side

04:56.340 --> 04:57.930
And they need to know we don't have a lot of time.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.010
Yes, ma'am.

05:25.740 --> 05:26.730
Come on

05:30.320 --> 05:31.450
Put your head down

05:46.230 --> 05:47.590
Get him ready for questioning.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.240
I want an explanation.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.040
You went after that shooter without backup or authorization,

05:57.040 --> 05:58.840
And then refused to tell me why.

05:59.070 --> 06:00.070
Now i want to know

06:00.250 --> 06:01.420
We didn't know who might be listening

06:02.550 --> 06:04.270
Someone in this office is helping Almeida

06:04.860 --> 06:05.440
What?

06:05.630 --> 06:07.700
The FBI has been compromised, larry. there's a leak

06:08.880 --> 06:10.820
Based on what? Excuse me!

06:11.050 --> 06:11.900
This is private

06:12.090 --> 06:14.840
Tony knew that we were going to Schector's office before we even got there

06:15.070 --> 06:16.960
That's how he managed a sniper in position

06:17.280 --> 06:21.700
The tip had to come from your office, whoever it was helped sheclter's assassinator got out of the building

06:21.880 --> 06:23.600
He is right lerry, that's why we couldn't tell you

06:24.550 --> 06:26.800
You've got a full perimeter, right?Covered every exit?

06:27.080 --> 06:28.700
How else do you think he got out of there?

06:32.850 --> 06:34.930
All right, assuming this is true, you got any idea who it could be?

06:35.110 --> 06:36.890
No, we didn't see him, but we knew that it went down

06:37.120 --> 06:38.650
Could be anyone in the bureau

06:39.420 --> 06:41.270
You need tighten your circle around tony

06:41.770 --> 06:44.970
You can't get any information that he gives you get back to the people he is working with

06:45.610 --> 06:47.590
Other wise you will never get the CIP device

06:52.230 --> 06:56.700
All right, I'll limit access the level 4 clearance above

06:57.650 --> 07:01.050
Have Janis run the security protocols see if she can track down the leak

07:01.910 --> 07:03.240
This's moss

07:03.460 --> 07:04.860
Sir I have a white house call for you

07:05.050 --> 07:06.580
-Yeah, I'll take it in my office -Yes

07:06.990 --> 07:08.210
-Yea

07:10.560 --> 07:12.180
It's the white house

07:14.450 --> 07:18.330
From now on, keep me in the loop

07:19.030 --> 07:21.650
And he doesn't do a damn thing without telling me

07:27.340 --> 07:28.970
We had to tell him, We had no choice

07:30.330 --> 07:31.770
You trust him?

07:32.040 --> 07:34.250
No question, there is no one I trust more

07:36.870 --> 07:38.450
Where they gonna hold tony?

07:42.240 --> 07:44.670
Well, I'm gonna have to lift up your shirt

07:58.360 --> 08:00.160
Is that comfortable for you?

08:03.410 --> 08:05.200
I'll take that as a Yes

08:13.320 --> 08:15.170
-Is he hooked up?-Yeah, we are ready to go

08:17.070 --> 08:20.810
Janis, I'll run this session, I want you to handle something else

08:21.760 --> 08:22.710
What else?

08:22.890 --> 08:24.290
Plugging a security leak

08:25.920 --> 08:27.050
What?

08:27.630 --> 08:29.930
We think someone in this office has been helping Almeida

08:30.660 --> 08:35.120
We've kicked this up to level four clearance.I want you to vet all communication and information flow.

08:35.730 --> 08:38.080
Red-tag every data point that has to do with almeida.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.070
Okay, do we have any idea who it is?

08:40.250 --> 08:42.650
No, we don't. I'm hoping that you can help us find out

08:42.919 --> 08:44.230
Okay

08:46.320 --> 08:51.190
There's a point-two deviation on the blood pressure monitor, you are gonna have to compensate for that

08:51.730 --> 08:52.650
Thanks,Janis

09:08.800 --> 09:10.250
Sorry about your friend Jack.

09:11.650 --> 09:14.350
I know you were hoping he wasn't capable of doing something like this.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.780
Yea

09:35.360 --> 09:37.480
Hey, what's going on, why are we in the level 4 lockdown?

09:37.670 --> 09:38.840
Don't worry about that, just do your job

09:39.070 --> 09:41.960
How am I supposed to do my job when i can't get through half the server nodes in the building

09:42.190 --> 09:44.530
You're sifting through the evidence gathered at almeida's arrest site

09:44.810 --> 09:46.930
That doesn't not require level 4 clearings

09:47.600 --> 09:49.480
Get everything you need to do your work, PLEASE

09:59.320 --> 10:01.460
Oui, je comprends

10:10.300 --> 10:12.160
It's confirmed, the FBI has Almeida.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.030
We should move on, there's nothing we can do.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.540
We have assets inside the bureau, we use them, perhaps will get him out.

10:19.950 --> 10:20.860
No, it's too risky.

10:21.290 --> 10:22.480
We'd be jeopardizing the entire mission.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.800
Almeida is just not that important.

10:24.210 --> 10:24.990
What about the next operation?

10:25.400 --> 10:26.420
Tony is prepped, he's ready to go.

10:26.650 --> 10:27.740
We'll just gonna have to find someone else.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.310
I realized you and Tony are friends.

10:30.610 --> 10:32.900
I don't like throwing him to the wolves anymore than you do.

10:33.370 --> 10:35.000
But he knew what he was getting into.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.550
I just spoke with Juma

10:39.010 --> 10:41.010
The American troops are still in position near our country.

10:41.460 --> 10:42.970
Tell Juma to be patient,

10:43.070 --> 10:45.170
President Taylor just received your demands.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.890
Then perhaps this time for a more forceful demonstration.

10:49.410 --> 10:50.780
If it comes to that, we will be ready.

10:51.190 --> 10:53.950
For now, let's give the white house a little more time to respond.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.770
For now.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.800
Agent Walker.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.980
Almeida is working for the Juma reign.

11:19.900 --> 11:20.750
What are you talking about?

11:21.050 --> 11:23.340
The president just received a set of demands.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.340
They're from Colonel Ike Dubaku.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.310
Dubaku?

11:26.450 --> 11:28.710
Looks like he contracted Almeida to build the CIP module.

11:29.060 --> 11:31.250
No, he's gonna blackmail the white house.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.510
How?

11:34.790 --> 11:35.470
Excuse me?

11:35.710 --> 11:37.620
How is he gonna blackmail the white house?

11:38.680 --> 11:41.910
By insisting we stand down the invasion force of the coast Sangala.

11:42.990 --> 11:44.970
If the president doesn't comply with his demands,

11:45.620 --> 11:47.570
Dubaku is gonna start killing americans.

11:49.010 --> 11:51.070
I can get you the CIP device.

11:52.020 --> 11:53.760
Just let me talk to him.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.340
I know him, I might know how he thinks.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.680
We have a history, I can use it to agaist him.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.980
He's got us this far, Larry.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.500
It makes sense.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.120
You're running out of time.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.880
You don't have a better option.

12:38.330 --> 12:40.260
Give us the room.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.510
I watched you die in my arms.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.420
You wanna explain to me why you're still alive?

13:00.990 --> 13:02.530
Didn't think so.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.010
Why don't I tell you what I know.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.700
I know that you're working for Juma regime.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.170
The white house just got their demands.

13:11.270 --> 13:13.770
And you have to know that I will never let that happen.

13:17.510 --> 13:19.280
Why don't you save yourself some time.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.750
and some pain and tell me what CIP device is.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.230
I can't tell you that, Jack.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.070
Tony, you're not just facing charges of domestic terrorism,

13:34.380 --> 13:36.170
you were gonna face international charges

13:36.460 --> 13:38.010
for aiding and abetting a genocide,

13:38.250 --> 13:40.120
They will give you the death penalty.

13:41.370 --> 13:43.110
Come on, just work with me on this.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.430
I can help you cut a deal, I can maybe even get you an immunity.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.050
You're wasting your breath, Jack.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.850
If I were you, I would tell the president to withdraw those troops.

13:51.310 --> 13:52.770
Because Dubaku is serious.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.230
He's ready to take thousands of american lives

13:55.330 --> 13:56.530
unless his demands are met.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.980
Why the hell are you doing this?

13:59.670 --> 14:02.460
Juma wanted the CIP module and he was brewing to pay for it.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.730
I don't believe you.

14:10.340 --> 14:11.720
Oh, come on, Jack.

14:12.190 --> 14:13.590
Don't act so surprised.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.680
Money is the only reason I have left doing anything.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.470
The government took care of that.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.160
The government did not kill Michelle.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.460
Charles Logan did.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.880
Charles Logan is the product of his enviroment.

14:26.870 --> 14:28.920
The government poisons everything in his path.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.590
But you know that better than me, Jack.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.790
Look what they did to you.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.750
Damn it, Tony, we're not talking about me.

14:36.550 --> 14:37.480
Oh, we're not?

14:39.980 --> 14:41.530
You're asking me why I'm doing this.

14:42.150 --> 14:43.610
I could ask you the same question.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.480
Here you are, working for the same people

14:45.580 --> 14:46.480
who wanted to put you into the prison,

14:47.460 --> 14:50.170
the same people who killed everything you love and left you with nothing,

14:51.080 --> 14:52.610
your daughter wants nothing to do with you

14:52.840 --> 14:53.610
Teri is dead,

14:53.770 --> 14:54.210
Shut up.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.020
Audrey Raines--

14:55.200 --> 14:55.700
I said shut up.

14:55.910 --> 14:56.910
No, Jack, no.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.450
You need to hear this.

14:58.450 --> 15:00.230
You need to start living in the real world!

15:00.370 --> 15:02.190
Because every second you help the government

15:02.300 --> 15:03.860
You're spitting on Teri's grave  Enough! get up!

15:05.540 --> 15:07.320
Get up!

15:08.600 --> 15:09.530
He's losing it

15:09.630 --> 15:10.800
where's the device?

15:10.850 --> 15:12.410
Tell me where the device is!

15:13.480 --> 15:15.200
So help me god, I will kill you.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.840
And you will stay dead this time.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.710
Where is the device?

15:22.460 --> 15:23.860
last chance.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.480
Where is it? Where is it?

15:33.520 --> 15:34.650
Deep sky.  Jack

15:34.780 --> 15:36.690
What did you just say?

15:36.940 --> 15:37.910
Son of a bitch.

15:38.020 --> 15:38.940
Give him a few more seconds.

15:39.030 --> 15:40.070
A few more seconds, he'll be dead.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.970
Deep sky.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.690
Jack. Let him go.

15:45.730 --> 15:46.960
Get him out of here.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.210
Get him out of here now.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.900
I need a medic here to check him out. In here, please.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.400
Keep an eye on him.

16:11.150 --> 16:12.430
Deep sky.

16:21.130 --> 16:22.240
Hello.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.930
This is Jack Bauer.

16:27.090 --> 16:28.210
Yes.

16:28.510 --> 16:29.720
I was told to call you.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.000
By whom?

16:31.200 --> 16:32.420
Tony Almeida

16:35.670 --> 16:38.070
He gave me this old CTU emergency phone code.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.880
Deep sky.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.660
It's Bill, Jack.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.370
Bill, what the hell is going on?

16:48.440 --> 16:49.510
Where is Tony?

16:49.630 --> 16:51.520
FBI headquarters. He's been arrested.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.160
Arrested?

16:53.250 --> 16:56.040
He orchastrated the terrorist attack on United States today.

16:56.110 --> 16:57.670
I was interrogating him.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.630
How would you get involved in this?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.690
The FBI brought me in to help track him down.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.380
We need to talk, Jack.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.180
I'll call you back on a secure VPN line.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.700
Bill, what the hell is going on?

17:08.780 --> 17:10.260
I need 10 minutes to set up the vpn...

17:10.339 --> 17:11.770
I don't have 10 minutes.

17:11.859 --> 17:13.010
10 minutes, Jack.

17:20.550 --> 17:21.650
I can't believe this.

17:21.650 --> 17:25.319
If Tony's been arrested, it's over

17:25.369 --> 17:26.770
Are you gonna tell Jack everything?

17:27.240 --> 17:28.560
If we want to get Tony back under cover,

17:28.610 --> 17:29.700
we will need his help.

17:30.070 --> 17:32.180
I don't think Jack is in a very helpful frame of mind.

17:34.050 --> 17:35.540
He's our only hope.

17:51.590 --> 17:52.440
Hello, Henry

17:52.610 --> 17:54.610
Ethan, I got your message about Sangala.

17:54.940 --> 17:55.910
Where is Allison?

17:56.170 --> 17:57.380
She's in her office.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.060
Henry.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.860
The president is in an impossible situation right now.

18:06.970 --> 18:08.670
She needs your support.

18:08.810 --> 18:10.350
But you can't give it to her

18:10.480 --> 18:14.340
if you keep going on this paranoid fantacies about Roger.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.820
I know about Samantha Roth.

18:15.940 --> 18:17.790
I know you accosted her in her office.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.760
She's hiding something about my son's murder.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.440
Roger wasn't murdered.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.350
He committed suicide.

18:25.980 --> 18:26.870
The coroner's office made that determination

18:26.960 --> 18:29.570
and the FBI confirmed it.

18:29.710 --> 18:31.390
They didn't look hard enough.

18:31.620 --> 18:33.510
Ethan, I know my son.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.600
He did not kill himself.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.790
He wasn't depressed. He had no reason.

18:37.850 --> 18:38.980
What if he did have a reason?

18:39.100 --> 18:40.550
I would have known.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.200
Not if he didn't tell you.

18:42.630 --> 18:44.640
Not if he was too ashamed to tell you

18:44.700 --> 18:45.830
or the president.

18:45.910 --> 18:46.950
What are you talking about?

18:48.620 --> 18:52.530
Roger was about to be investigated by the sec for insider trading.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.830
He'd used information he only could have gotten through

18:57.190 --> 18:58.430
his access to the president.

18:59.140 --> 19:01.440
Before the sec opened the investigation,

19:02.100 --> 19:03.740
he killed himself.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.050
I don't believe it.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.070
It's all in here.

19:09.820 --> 19:12.110
In the sec case file.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.820
Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this?

19:15.700 --> 19:18.080
Frank boylan agreed to bury the case.

19:18.170 --> 19:20.500
As a political favor to the president.

19:20.630 --> 19:23.450
My wife knew about this and she didn't tell me?

19:23.460 --> 19:24.640
She wanted to.

19:24.890 --> 19:27.650
But she also wanted to protect your memory of your son.

19:28.530 --> 19:29.940
You were in so much pain.

19:29.990 --> 19:32.100
Damn it, Ethan. He was my son. I deserve the truth.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.490
And keeping it from you was a terrible mistake.

19:34.570 --> 19:36.210
I realize that now.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.000
But the president and I both thought you were

19:38.750 --> 19:40.450
moving on with your life.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.510
Mr. Kanin.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.580
The president wants to see you.

19:49.550 --> 19:51.090
Does she know you're telling me this now?

19:52.330 --> 19:56.240
No. And I think it best we keep it that way,

19:56.360 --> 19:59.560
at least till this crisis is resolved.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.070
I feel I have to tell him, sir. I'm sorry.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.020
Alright, thank you.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.650
Madam president, you wanted to see me?

20:29.470 --> 20:32.720
Admiral Smith laid out the timeline of withdrawing our forces.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.420
He's saying to meet Dubaku's demands,

20:36.140 --> 20:38.910
we need to order the pullback by 1 pm.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.200
That's not much time.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.580
No, it isn't.

20:43.710 --> 20:47.270
Well maybe this Almeida will tell us where to find the CIP device.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.340
No. Tim Woods just heard from the Bureau.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.620
So far Almeida's refusing to cooperate.

20:52.730 --> 20:54.700
Well maybe he's just positioning for a deal.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.150
Tim doesn't think so.

20:56.310 --> 20:58.690
He said we shouldn't count on Almeida to talk.

20:59.660 --> 21:00.680
I see.

21:02.150 --> 21:03.620
So

21:04.980 --> 21:08.050
unless I order our forces to stand down.

21:08.710 --> 21:13.060
I'll be condemning innocent Americans to death.

21:13.490 --> 21:15.390
And if we capitulate,

21:15.790 --> 21:19.640
thousands of Sangalas will be slaughtered.

21:27.090 --> 21:28.940
How did this happen, Ethan?

21:30.690 --> 21:33.820
How could we been so caught off guard,

21:34.390 --> 21:38.040
and now I have to decide between two impossible choices.

21:39.770 --> 21:44.400
Well, at least one of those choices does stand a good chance

21:44.550 --> 21:46.910
of preserving American lives.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.360
You mean withdrawal.

21:48.450 --> 21:51.180
We are nearing the time and we have to consider it.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.180
We're not there yet, Ethan.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.620
I can't discuss this.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.380
Not until we have explored every possible option.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.900
Tell the FBI to keep working on Almeida.

22:05.770 --> 22:07.820
Yes, madam president.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.420
Mr. Buchanan. I've got the secure line.

22:21.220 --> 22:22.740
All right. Dial the number.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.560
Bill, stop screwing around. Tell me what the hell is going on!

22:29.700 --> 22:31.570
Jack, Tony is not a terrorist.

22:31.670 --> 22:33.720
He's working deep cover. He's working with me.

22:33.810 --> 22:36.370
We have proof that he tried to bring down two commercial airliners.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.770
You don't know the whole story.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.160
That's part of an ongoing operation.

22:39.260 --> 22:41.490
Operation? What kind of operation

22:41.560 --> 22:43.720
puts hundreds if not thousands of lives in danger.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.130
Jack, please.

22:45.190 --> 22:46.460
You need to listen.

22:46.530 --> 22:47.890
Our government is corrupted.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.070
There are people on the inside

22:49.110 --> 22:51.980
who are actively aiding Dubaku and Juma regime.

22:54.250 --> 22:58.100
Point is Tony was supposed to be near the CIP module the whole time.

22:58.980 --> 23:01.670
With him in custody, we've lost our ability

23:01.760 --> 23:03.420
to control it and to attack this conspiracy.

23:03.490 --> 23:05.380
Who's a part of the conspiracy? Give me names.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.020
We don't know the extent of it.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.520
We have reason to believe

23:08.610 --> 23:10.340
that members of the president's inner council are on payroll.

23:10.420 --> 23:11.840
Who's sheperding you this information? Which agency?

23:12.360 --> 23:13.420
Let's just take it, Jack. There's no sheperd.

23:13.500 --> 23:17.830
There is no agency. This corruption runs deep and wide.

23:18.110 --> 23:20.250
We're working outside the government.

23:20.370 --> 23:22.780
It's why we have to get Tony back under cover.

23:22.870 --> 23:25.000
He's at FBI headquarters, Bill.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.580
I never said it's gonna be easy.

23:26.660 --> 23:28.120
But we have to try.

23:29.830 --> 23:32.280
Chloe is already into their system.

23:32.460 --> 23:33.740
Chloe's working on this?

23:33.830 --> 23:35.680
Hi, Jack. It's good to hear your voice.

23:36.050 --> 23:37.120
Yeah. You, too.

23:37.170 --> 23:38.850
I saw the hearing on c span

23:38.920 --> 23:40.870
I can't believe what the senator said to you.

23:41.410 --> 23:43.190
You looked good go.

23:43.230 --> 23:45.390
Jack we need your help to get Tony out of there.

23:46.450 --> 23:48.970
There's an agent at the FBI Renee Walker. She could help.

23:49.030 --> 23:51.160
No, the FBI has been compromised.

23:51.220 --> 23:53.320
Somebody in the bereau is aiding Dubaku.

23:53.410 --> 23:55.050
You don't understand, Bill, jack, I trust her.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.000
Jack, if you think you need to use her

23:57.050 --> 23:59.340
to get Tony out of FBI headquarters, then do it.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.110
But you'll be making her a target.

24:03.780 --> 24:05.370
No, you're right.

24:05.460 --> 24:07.640
You're right. We'll do it your way. I can get to Tony myself.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.340
But Chloe's gonna have to get us outside the building.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.700
We're already on it.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.250
Get back to me as soon as you are ready.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.770
I'm on my way, Chloe.

24:36.010 --> 24:39.900
Hey, Sean. You know these data mining plugins we downloaded last week,

24:39.950 --> 24:41.600
where do we file those?

24:43.740 --> 24:45.690
Where do we file those?

24:45.790 --> 24:48.240
Yeah. File folder A76.

24:48.660 --> 24:50.030
Do you need help with something?

24:50.090 --> 24:51.280
No. Why?

24:51.570 --> 24:53.120
You seem confused.

24:53.520 --> 24:57.060
I just don't like having to dance around this level-4 lockdown.

24:58.130 --> 25:01.120
Oh, well, I thought you welcomed the opportunity to complain about something.

25:33.190 --> 25:34.270
Hello?

25:34.340 --> 25:35.990
Mr. Taylor. It's Samantha.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.560
I was going to call you.

25:40.210 --> 25:42.630
I owe you an apology, Sam.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.440
I was wrong to confront you like that.

25:45.530 --> 25:48.300
Uh, no. You weren't.

25:50.220 --> 25:52.270
I wasn't completely honest to you.

25:52.330 --> 25:53.760
What do you mean?

25:55.490 --> 25:57.950
Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr. Taylor.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.630
He was murdered.

26:04.140 --> 26:06.750
I need to see you. Alone.

26:07.010 --> 26:08.800
Will you meet me?

26:10.710 --> 26:12.470
Of course.

26:13.370 --> 26:15.780
Where is the CIP device, Tony?

26:16.760 --> 26:18.810
Who would you gave it to?

26:21.910 --> 26:24.330
People you're taking money from.

26:24.450 --> 26:27.870
Thought you might like to see some of their handywork.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.730
You know how many people they've killed

26:33.810 --> 26:36.170
since they went back into Sangala?

26:38.750 --> 26:42.730
Two hundred thousand and counting.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.410
Most of them women and children.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.130
Tony.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.070
You really want this on your conscience?

26:55.960 --> 26:59.470
My conscience is clear.

26:59.610 --> 27:02.500
There's nothing you can say or do will change that.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.900
So why don't you do the smart thing

27:04.980 --> 27:07.380
and tell president Taylor to stand down the strike force?

27:07.500 --> 27:09.760
Because unless she does,

27:09.920 --> 27:12.860
planes will be falling from the sky.

27:13.130 --> 27:16.400
And then you'll have a whole new batch of photoes to look at.

27:17.180 --> 27:22.490
Only this time, they'll be of dead Americans.

27:25.420 --> 27:27.580
Larry, we need to talk.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.390
Almeida's not gonna break.

27:43.460 --> 27:44.500
We don't know that.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.180
He's a trained CTU agent.

27:46.260 --> 27:49.040
He's conducted interrogations just like this one.

27:49.110 --> 27:49.950
There's nothing you can say to him

27:49.990 --> 27:51.790
that he hasn't said to himself a hundred times.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.030
So what are you suggesting? We give up?

27:53.140 --> 27:56.970
No. I'm suggesting we might need more forceful approach.

27:58.420 --> 27:59.980
You mean torture.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.510
No, there are methods of coercion

28:01.550 --> 28:03.080
that we haven't even considered. Pharmaceuticals...

28:03.290 --> 28:06.440
I can't believe you wanna have this conversation.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.060
You're not hearing the argument...

28:08.190 --> 28:11.090
The argument is crazy. It's illegal.

28:11.350 --> 28:13.920
And it's over. As a matter of fact, I want Bauer out of here.

28:14.010 --> 28:15.430
He's a wildcard. He's dangerous.

28:15.530 --> 28:16.970
I want him out of the building.

28:17.050 --> 28:18.400
Go. Process him out. I will continue here.

28:18.460 --> 28:21.790
Go. Go! Now.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.040
Renee, I was just about to call you.

28:40.130 --> 28:41.790
I may have found the leak.

28:41.900 --> 28:44.170
Someone did a runaround under level-4 lockdown.

28:44.340 --> 28:46.280
They circumvented the security fence

28:46.340 --> 28:47.960
and they hacked into the FAA database.

28:48.050 --> 28:49.170
FAA, are you sure?

28:49.220 --> 28:50.410
Positive. I don't what they were doing in there,

28:50.480 --> 28:53.150
but they had to navigate some very sophisticated tagger software.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.100
When was this?

28:54.160 --> 28:55.080
Just a few minutes ago.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.210
Any idea who it was?

28:56.260 --> 28:58.360
No. But I may be able to pull out user ID out of the terminal.

28:58.410 --> 28:59.430
Okay, which terminal?

28:59.480 --> 29:00.860
Main frame room, terminal three.

29:00.910 --> 29:02.700
- Check it out. Let me know what you find. - Ok.

29:04.580 --> 29:06.110
Agent Tyler.

29:06.140 --> 29:08.380
I need you to prepare the briefing package for Jack Bauer

29:08.420 --> 29:09.760
and bring me his personal effects.

29:09.820 --> 29:10.840
Yeah, I'll bring them right to you.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.380
Thanks. I'll be in my office.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.470
Last login: Sean Hillinger

30:00.470 --> 30:01.020
What are you doing?

30:03.350 --> 30:04.430
What's the matter?

30:07.520 --> 30:08.740
Just, you just stay where you're.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.310
Janis, stop it.

30:13.210 --> 30:14.790
Would you just talk to me?

30:16.430 --> 30:18.630
I know you've been helping Tony Almeida.

30:19.470 --> 30:20.590
What? Are you crazy?

30:20.630 --> 30:21.110
No.

30:21.390 --> 30:22.790
You broke into the FAA database,

30:22.890 --> 30:24.400
that's your server ID.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.720
Yes, my server ID,

30:27.010 --> 30:28.210
but I'm not helping the terrorists,

30:28.210 --> 30:29.210
you wanna know why I was in there,

30:29.300 --> 30:30.330
I'll tell you, I was worried.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.870
My wife on of those planes up there,

30:32.970 --> 30:34.670
I had to see if her flight had been grounded yet.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.700
You expect me to believe that?

30:35.800 --> 30:37.100
Why are you sneeking around?

30:37.400 --> 30:40.280
'cause the level 4 lockdown cut me out of the FAA database

30:40.530 --> 30:42.050
I couldn't monitor her flight.

30:44.970 --> 30:46.900
Look, see for yourself.

30:53.110 --> 30:54.780
Flight 112 out of the Las Vegas.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.390
Christina Hillinger

30:56.650 --> 30:57.910
Okay, just stay there.

31:00.810 --> 31:01.910
CHRISTINA HILLINGER

31:02.280 --> 31:04.920
God, Shawn, you scared the hell outta me,

31:05.190 --> 31:06.190
why wouldn't you just tell me that?

31:06.630 --> 31:08.290
'cause what I was doing was borderline illegal,

31:08.390 --> 31:09.490
I didn't wanna get you in trouble.

31:10.010 --> 31:11.610
plus, you looked like you've had enough on your plate.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.410
Damn it, I told Renee I'd found a security leak.

31:14.890 --> 31:16.230
Is that what's going on around here?

31:16.330 --> 31:17.630
There's just a security leak?

31:17.780 --> 31:19.410
Don't worry about it, go back to your station,

31:19.890 --> 31:21.030
keep this to yourself

31:21.130 --> 31:22.830
and I will clean up your mess.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.770
Go.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.160
Idiot.

31:35.290 --> 31:36.250
Go ahead.

31:36.570 --> 31:37.970
Jack, agent Walker is on her way,

31:38.070 --> 31:39.570
she's heading down the corridor toward your room.

31:39.750 --> 31:40.790
Copy that.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.420
How are you doing with the loops?

31:42.560 --> 31:43.740
I'm dropping the first one in now.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.210
I have a series of loops

31:45.310 --> 31:46.410
and I'm dropping them as you go.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.600
Security won't see a thing.

31:49.350 --> 31:50.390
Understand.

31:51.270 --> 31:52.650
Standing by.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.220
Sorry, Jack. We're proceeding without you.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.830
Wasn't my decision.

32:10.390 --> 32:11.830
Well, we would't have Almeida without you,

32:11.930 --> 32:13.530
we own you alot.

32:13.830 --> 32:15.000
Thanks.

32:16.540 --> 32:17.390
That paperwork for me?

32:17.690 --> 32:19.530
Yeah, you need to fill this out.

32:26.060 --> 32:28.450
I want you to know I'm gonna put in a good word with the Justice Department for you.

32:29.330 --> 32:31.030
Maybe it will help.

32:31.310 --> 32:32.310
Thanks.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.030
Jack.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.270
Don't fight it.

32:37.690 --> 32:38.920
Jack.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.690
Don't fight it.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.740
Jack just took out agent Walker,

33:16.860 --> 33:18.370
he has her keycard and her weapon.

33:18.470 --> 33:19.570
He's going to get Tony.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.410
What's your location.

33:20.550 --> 33:21.600
About ten minutes out.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.820
Did you get my rendezvous point?

33:25.550 --> 33:26.870
Just showed up on my GPS.

33:27.140 --> 33:28.140
Okay, great...

33:28.420 --> 33:29.690
I gotta go, it's Jack.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.200
Jack?

33:31.990 --> 33:34.160
I'm ready.I've got access to Interrogation One,

33:34.290 --> 33:35.300
what's Bill's ETA?

33:35.600 --> 33:36.680
About ten minutes.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.000
How's the corridor?

33:39.170 --> 33:39.850
Clear.

33:40.450 --> 33:41.670
Wait for my call.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.150
Put your weapons down, now!

33:54.420 --> 33:55.410
What the hell do you think you're doing?

33:55.640 --> 33:56.990
I said do it now!

33:58.040 --> 33:58.950
Do it or I will kill him.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.140
Okay, all right.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.000
Put it down, it's all right, do it.

34:02.830 --> 34:05.370
Slowly, slowly.

34:08.620 --> 34:10.409
Now, you. Do it!

34:10.630 --> 34:11.480
All right.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.730
Kick the weapon over to me.

34:21.020 --> 34:21.540
Come on.

34:21.750 --> 34:22.600
Okay, all right.

34:23.949 --> 34:25.370
Uncuff him.

34:26.949 --> 34:27.780
Where's agent Walker?

34:27.880 --> 34:28.380
What did you do to her?

34:28.449 --> 34:29.320
Shut up!

34:29.550 --> 34:30.560
Bauer, you're gonna make it outta here.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.020
I said shut up.

34:34.860 --> 34:35.489
I talked to Bill.

34:35.590 --> 34:36.550
How much did he tell you?

34:36.590 --> 34:38.080
Enough, we're gonna get you outta here.

34:38.610 --> 34:39.940
Chole's tapped into the security.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.530
She's gonna walk us outta this building,

34:41.630 --> 34:42.929
all you need to do is follow my lead.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.199
Chole, it's Jack, do you copy?

34:45.230 --> 34:45.940
Copy, Jack.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.520
I got Tony at the door of Interrogation One leading out to the hallway.

34:48.750 --> 34:49.489
Okay, I see you,

34:49.590 --> 34:51.290
I'm gonna direct you to the southwest exit.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.790
Right now you're in the least populated area of the building.

34:53.969 --> 34:56.100
But you're gonna run into a lot more resistance before you get outta there.

34:56.570 --> 34:57.570
Copy that, you ready?

34:57.580 --> 34:58.280
Clear to move.

34:58.350 --> 34:59.540
Let's go.

35:03.150 --> 35:04.790
Hold on, there're two people coming out of the elevator.

35:05.340 --> 35:06.880
Copy that, come on.

35:16.460 --> 35:18.760
Listen, Jack, i'm sorry for the stuff I said back there.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.560
Just needed to get you close enough

35:20.660 --> 35:22.060
to give you Bill's codename.

35:22.170 --> 35:24.440
Just glad I didn't break you neck.

35:24.740 --> 35:26.840
Well, you came close.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.670
Yeah, sorry about that.

35:31.740 --> 35:32.320
Okay, clear.

35:32.430 --> 35:33.740
We're clear.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.040
I cleaned up your trail,

35:51.040 --> 35:53.640
we will just keep this transgression between us.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.080
Although I don't know what I'm gonna tell Renee.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.570
Have you heard one thing I've just said?

35:58.700 --> 36:00.790
Yeah, yeah, that's fine, take a look at this.

36:01.310 --> 36:02.110
What?

36:03.390 --> 36:05.530
There's a performance hit on one of our signal routers,

36:05.630 --> 36:07.030
It's down 0.7%

36:14.800 --> 36:16.370
You're right, somebody is riding our bandwith.

36:16.630 --> 36:18.790
Hecking in, is that possible? With all the safeguards?

36:19.330 --> 36:20.640
Anything is possible

36:20.740 --> 36:21.940
if you know what you're doing.

36:24.290 --> 36:25.730
They're inside our security sub-net.

36:26.190 --> 36:27.680
They've accessed the surveillance system.

36:28.660 --> 36:29.640
What are you gonna do?

36:29.880 --> 36:31.470
Lock them out.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.160
Okay, Jack, you're gonna make a left down the next hallway.

36:44.260 --> 36:46.160
There's an emergency stairwell at the end.

36:46.450 --> 36:47.940
Will that stairwell get us down the ground level?

36:48.080 --> 36:48.870
Yes.

36:49.100 --> 36:50.010
Copy that.

36:56.940 --> 36:58.050
Hold on.

36:58.590 --> 36:59.170
What's wrong?

36:59.590 --> 37:00.610
I lost my feed.

37:01.340 --> 37:02.590
Chole's feed just went down.

37:06.010 --> 37:06.790
What did you do?

37:07.050 --> 37:08.430
I've pinged the line and it automatically reset.

37:08.890 --> 37:10.290
Someone was hacking in,

37:10.390 --> 37:11.490
they were taking out our surveillance cameras.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.560
Janis, take a look at this.

37:14.780 --> 37:15.820
Send it to me.

37:24.460 --> 37:25.670
Security, this is Janis Gold.

37:26.130 --> 37:27.300
We have a code 12 in progress,

37:27.400 --> 37:28.800
we need a team to Interrogation One.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.050
Yes, ma'am, right away.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.460
All agents, security breach, code 12.

37:35.180 --> 37:37.160
We gotta keep moving, let's go.

37:55.830 --> 37:58.210
Security team between us at the southwest exit.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.710
Chloe, what have you got? We're boxed in.

38:00.830 --> 38:02.420
Someone at FBI is blocking my every move,

38:02.520 --> 38:03.520
it's really starting to piss me off.

38:04.140 --> 38:05.560
You need to get them back into their system,

38:05.660 --> 38:06.760
otherwise we're not gonna make it outta here.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.310
Jack, I'm sorry, I'm trying.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.510
We've got make a move, Jack.

38:28.730 --> 38:29.620
I know.

38:31.860 --> 38:32.890
Let's go now.

38:46.840 --> 38:47.930
Chole, talk to me.

38:48.230 --> 38:49.690
I'm still locked out, trying to work around it.

38:50.260 --> 38:51.560
Jack, we're sitting ducks if we stay here.

38:52.090 --> 38:52.760
I know.

38:54.510 --> 38:55.680
Chole, we have to take the stairwell,

38:55.780 --> 38:56.780
we don't have a choice.

38:56.910 --> 38:57.930
Quietly.

39:03.100 --> 39:03.840
Where are they?

39:05.130 --> 39:05.670
We're looking.

39:05.770 --> 39:07.370
Find them.

39:16.320 --> 39:16.870
Are you all right?

39:17.270 --> 39:18.490
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, are you okay?

39:18.720 --> 39:19.150
Yeah.

39:19.970 --> 39:21.500
They're still in the buidling, we're trying to locate them.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.040
I can't believe this, what the hell is Jack doing?

39:23.780 --> 39:25.760
He's helping his friend escape, that's what he's doing.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.910
I'm--I'm sorry, Larry. I shouldn't have trusted him.

39:29.180 --> 39:29.800
I got them.

39:30.090 --> 39:31.360
Southwest stairwell.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.860
Security, this is Moss,

39:32.960 --> 39:34.860
suspects are from southwest stairwell, descending.

39:34.930 --> 39:36.710
Pass the fifth floor.

39:37.450 --> 39:38.430
Lock on the building perimeter

39:38.530 --> 39:40.630
and deploy two teams in the first floor service corridor.

39:40.790 --> 39:42.410
Be aware, the suspects are armed.

39:42.670 --> 39:43.530
We need them alive.

39:46.440 --> 39:47.310
Okay, I'm back up, Jack.

39:47.490 --> 39:48.410
Copy that.

39:51.620 --> 39:52.410
What was that?

39:52.900 --> 39:53.600
Heckers' back in,

39:53.700 --> 39:55.400
whoever this is, they're very good.

39:55.670 --> 39:56.830
Well, lock them out.

39:56.970 --> 39:57.950
I'm trying.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.040
Jack, hold up.

40:01.230 --> 40:01.850
What is it?

40:02.160 --> 40:04.360
You're heading into an ambush, the six-man team.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.480
They're heading up toward you in the stairwell.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.290
Understand, we will evade.

40:07.390 --> 40:08.490
They're coming on the stairs.

40:10.530 --> 40:12.040
Pass me that fire extinguisher.

40:26.790 --> 40:27.960
We're on the roof of the parking lot.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.200
I see you, good work.

40:29.390 --> 40:30.580
Go to the north end, Jack.

40:30.680 --> 40:31.580
Bill's almost there.

40:31.670 --> 40:32.610
He's in the blue van.

40:32.860 --> 40:33.730
Copy that.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.150
They're outside, they went through the third floor window.

40:37.460 --> 40:38.100
Let's go.

40:38.340 --> 40:40.200
Perimeter team, they're in the parking garage.

40:40.450 --> 40:42.350
Notify Matro police, have them corden off a five-block perimeter.

40:46.410 --> 40:47.710
On the right, get down.

40:53.140 --> 40:54.610
We gotta get you outta here and back undercover,

40:54.890 --> 40:56.080
I will be right behind you, go.

41:38.410 --> 41:39.530
This is gonna hurt.

41:58.370 --> 41:59.410
Tony, let's go.

42:04.760 --> 42:05.690
Come on, Jack.

42:12.940 --> 42:14.120
Go, Bill.

42:25.980 --> 42:27.450
Agent Moss, they're gone,

42:27.550 --> 42:28.750
they got outside the perimeter.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.160
All right, Chole, I got them,

42:42.260 --> 42:43.160
any sign of pursuit?

42:43.360 --> 42:45.350
Not so far, they must be still mobilizing,

42:45.460 --> 42:46.560
we caught them off guard.

42:46.910 --> 42:47.740
Traffice cams.

42:48.020 --> 42:49.980
I'm cycling the frequcies to clear path now.

42:50.090 --> 42:50.850
Good.

42:51.620 --> 42:52.340
Are you all right?

42:52.570 --> 42:53.420
I'm fine, where are we going?

42:53.790 --> 42:54.490
It's not far.

42:55.140 --> 42:57.040
Bill, I did what you wanted, I got Tony out of there.

42:57.860 --> 42:59.290
Tell me what's going on?

42:59.550 --> 43:00.670
When we get there, I will tell you everything.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
