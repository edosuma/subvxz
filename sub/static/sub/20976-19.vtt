superstar Detox.

00:08.667 --> 00:09.667
- Wow.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.166
It's really filled.

00:11.166 --> 00:14.133
Dee has a large amount
of silicone injected

00:14.133 --> 00:15.367
in various parts of the body.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.133
At a moment's notice,

00:17.133 --> 00:20.166
any of those can turn
into a major problem.

00:21.166 --> 00:23.266
- I had a little friend
come over who's gonna help us.

00:23.266 --> 00:25.700
- Okay.
- The leech lady.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.133
- The last thing
she probably thinks about

00:27.133 --> 00:29.433
is having a leech on her face.

00:29.433 --> 00:32.133
Sorry.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.700
The nipple
is turning darker.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.367
- The nipple was black
at this point and crusting over.

00:37.367 --> 00:40.467
- You got screwed.

00:40.467 --> 00:41.600
- Yeah.

and my six pack is whack.

00:58.333 --> 01:02.066
My abs are a little off-kilter.
They look very uneven.

01:02.066 --> 01:04.200
It looks like if you're
playing Jenga, almost.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.200
[laughter]

01:06.200 --> 01:08.200
I am world-famous drag
superstar Detox.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.600
I was on season five
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

01:10.600 --> 01:13.467
and season two of
"RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars."

01:13.467 --> 01:15.166
I don't even know
how many wigs I have,

01:15.166 --> 01:18.133
but I would have to guess
probably around 200.

01:18.133 --> 01:21.600
I have a lot, like this one.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.467
This one makes me feel
like a woman.

01:25.467 --> 01:28.100
And this one makes me
feel like a woman on crack.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.333
[laughs]

01:31.500 --> 01:34.500
I remember seeing my first
drag show and saying,

01:34.500 --> 01:36.233
"That's what I need
to be doing."

01:36.233 --> 01:40.367
And I was, like, 17 years old
wearing 10" platform heels

01:40.367 --> 01:42.367
going into every bar
in the city,

01:42.367 --> 01:44.100
and people knew who I was.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.734
To be so young and to be
accepted into that world

01:45.734 --> 01:48.367
at such an early age--
it was like a high for me.

01:48.367 --> 01:51.467
And then I started meeting all
of these other people who had,

01:51.467 --> 01:52.600
like, these beautiful bodies,

01:52.600 --> 01:55.233
and these gorgeous faces,
and they looked like aliens.

01:55.233 --> 01:56.266
And I was like, "I want that."

01:56.266 --> 01:59.633
And then I met this guy
who was able to offer me

01:59.633 --> 02:02.133
some alterations here and there,

02:02.133 --> 02:04.633
so I jumped on the opportunity,
and I jumped on the needle.

02:04.633 --> 02:07.500
If I had to put a number
on the amount of silicon

02:07.500 --> 02:10.633
I have in my body,
probably gallons.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.734
[mimics syringes squirting]

02:12.734 --> 02:14.467
The first thing
I had done was my face:

02:14.467 --> 02:17.400
cheeks, lips,
and a little bit in my chin.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.200
I swelled up so much,
but I was obsessed.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.133
My lips were, like, huge,

02:23.133 --> 02:24.400
and I could see them bouncing
when I would walk around,

02:24.400 --> 02:26.600
and I was like, "I have to put
lipstick on immediately,"

02:26.600 --> 02:27.767
and so I did.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.533
I took, like, the brightest
pink lipstick I could find.

02:29.533 --> 02:31.633
I put them on.
I was like, "Oh, my God."

02:31.633 --> 02:33.533
Well, my entire life
I was a string bean.

02:33.533 --> 02:34.700
I was very skinny,

02:34.700 --> 02:39.600
and I realized that I could have
a beautiful body by injection.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.266
Fill me up!
[laughs]

02:41.266 --> 02:42.500
And I had my pecs done.

02:42.500 --> 02:46.166
I had my shoulders done.
I had my biceps done.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.100
My hips. My ass.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.300
I was in heaven,

02:49.300 --> 02:52.567
but the one thing that I regret
the most doing is my six pack.

02:52.567 --> 02:56.433
They're not perfectly parallel.
They look very uneven.

02:56.433 --> 02:57.700
Getting recognized everywhere

02:57.700 --> 02:58.567
there's definitely
a little bit of fame.

02:58.567 --> 02:59.700
I don't like to say
that I'm famous.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.567
I am definitely gaymous.

03:01.567 --> 03:03.533
What's the world gonna think?
Because they're very critical.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.166
They all have
a very strong opinion.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.433
And I was like, "Well,
I don't want to have to, like,

03:06.433 --> 03:07.667
sit and read nasty comments

03:07.667 --> 03:09.300
all the time about
how gross my abs are."

03:09.300 --> 03:11.166
I always have to feel
like I'm covered up.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.667
I always have to have
some kind of, like, a corset

03:12.667 --> 03:14.667
or a girdle to kind of
smooth everything out,

03:14.667 --> 03:17.667
because I don't want people
to see those weird lumps.

03:17.667 --> 03:22.400
So Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow,
please take these abs out

03:22.400 --> 03:24.700
and make me the best little
drag queen in the world.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.734
I would love you forever.

03:26.734 --> 03:29.467
♪ ♪

03:29.467 --> 03:31.066
- My name is Jessica.

03:31.066 --> 03:34.166
I'm 32 years old,
and I'm from Omaha, Nebraska.

03:34.166 --> 03:39.533
I lost my left breast,
and I am desperate to find it.

03:39.533 --> 03:41.734
I was a pretty normal kid.

03:41.734 --> 03:44.667
Everything was great, until the
weight gain started to happen.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.533
Any time I was stressed out

03:46.533 --> 03:50.133
or had a problem I turned
to food for comfort.

03:50.133 --> 03:53.200
By the time I was 15,
barely 5 foot.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.066
Over 200 pounds.
Kids are mean.

03:56.066 --> 03:59.300
I was picked on
and just miserable,

03:59.300 --> 04:02.600
so at 25 years old,
I got pregnant.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.066
I was probably around 230
when I delivered my son.

04:06.066 --> 04:07.500
I looked in the mirror
one day and said,

04:07.500 --> 04:09.233
"I have to do something
about this,

04:09.233 --> 04:11.633
to be a happy, healthy,
productive person.

04:11.633 --> 04:14.100
To be a great mother
for this baby."

04:14.100 --> 04:18.500
And so I started every workout
video you could imagine,

04:18.500 --> 04:21.600
and I was done treating
my body like crap.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.600
It was the best thing
I had ever done for myself.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.633
So as we all know,
when you lose a lot of weight,

04:27.633 --> 04:30.100
you are left with extra skin.

04:30.100 --> 04:35.233
I decided to go get breast
implants to fill in the skin,

04:35.233 --> 04:38.200
and that turned out
to be a nightmare.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.734
The very next day I knew
something was terribly wrong.

04:40.734 --> 04:42.233
My left breast was swollen up

04:42.233 --> 04:43.734
about double the size
of the right,

04:43.734 --> 04:45.333
and my nipple
was turning purple,

04:45.333 --> 04:47.333
so I immediately
called the doctor.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.533
The final decision was, "Let's
see if it absorbs on its own."

04:50.533 --> 04:54.233
Seeing your nipple
turn black and scab

04:54.233 --> 04:56.667
is the scariest [bleep]
you will ever see.

04:56.667 --> 04:59.333
It's like watching your body die
in front of your eyes,

04:59.333 --> 05:00.600
so I decided to make
an appointment

05:00.600 --> 05:02.667
with my primary doctor

05:02.667 --> 05:04.600
whom I'd been with
for ten years.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.667
My doctor was appalled
and said, "You have MRSA.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.133
It's been eating your tissue."

05:11.133 --> 05:12.000
I was terrified.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.066
The death rate is 40%
once it gets in.

05:16.066 --> 05:19.467
I had two surgeries
to remove the infection,

05:19.467 --> 05:22.533
and when I came out
I had nothing left.

05:22.533 --> 05:24.266
The implants were both removed,

05:24.266 --> 05:27.333
and the scars were
just unbelievable.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.266
It looked like a shark
had eaten me.

05:29.266 --> 05:31.567
As a result of the surgeries,

05:31.567 --> 05:34.500
I suffered severe nerve damage

05:34.500 --> 05:38.233
on the left side
of my arm into my hand.

05:38.233 --> 05:40.266
I couldn't use
my arm for months.

05:40.266 --> 05:42.300
It's painful
in everything that I do.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.100
I had to work and work
and work to tie my son's shoe.

05:46.100 --> 05:50.567
I had doctors' notes signed
for permanent disability.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.567
I was buying nerve
pain medications

05:52.567 --> 05:55.166
and painkillers
out of my pocket.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.166
At the end of all
of these surgeries,

05:57.166 --> 05:59.033
I couldn't tell you
how much I spent.

05:59.033 --> 06:01.100
I couldn't afford
my home anymore.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.567
It had completely broken me.

06:04.567 --> 06:06.400
I moved in with my mother,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.533
so that she could take
care of me and my son.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.066
I knew the gym was going to be
the first thing to save me.

06:18.066 --> 06:21.133
I was going to rebuild
my physical strength,

06:21.133 --> 06:24.400
and it was just something
to get back to normalcy for me,

06:24.400 --> 06:28.200
because it had been such
a big part of my life.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.333
Spot.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.133
- I think it's complete
bull[bleep]

06:31.133 --> 06:32.467
what happened to Jessica.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.467
She's lost everything.
She lost her home.

06:34.467 --> 06:37.133
She lost her job.
She lost a boob.

06:37.133 --> 06:39.300
I mean, that's a lot to lose.

06:39.300 --> 06:42.467
- I feel like I look like a man,
because of the proportions.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.467
I tend to just not try at all.

06:44.467 --> 06:48.066
Baggy clothes and no makeup are
pretty common for me these days.

06:48.066 --> 06:52.066
I am dying to feel
like a woman again.

06:52.066 --> 06:57.100
If I can just look symmetrical
with my clothes on,

06:57.100 --> 07:00.233
life would be
a billion times better.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.333
- It's funny. In my office,
they can tell how hard a case

07:02.333 --> 07:04.367
is by how many times I sigh.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.200
This is a multiple sigh case.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.433
This is actually a really,
really sad story.

07:08.433 --> 07:12.066
This is a girl who had
a breast augmentation.

07:12.066 --> 07:14.633
Just a routine
breast augmentation.

07:14.633 --> 07:19.433
She suffered blood supply
problem to the entire breast.

07:19.433 --> 07:21.600
- How does that happen?
- I don't know.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.767
Look. Gone.

07:22.767 --> 07:25.233
- She almost looks like she is
a cancer reconstruction patient.

07:25.233 --> 07:27.233
- She lost
the entire left breast,

07:27.233 --> 07:30.367
so let's bring Jessica
and ask her what's going on.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.166
- Can you please
send in Jessica?

07:33.633 --> 07:35.400
- Hello.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.266
- Hi, Jessica. Dr. Nassif.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:37.266 --> 07:38.734
- Hi, Jessica. Terry Dubrow.
Pleasure to meet you.

07:38.734 --> 07:40.000
- Nice to meet you.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.133
It's gonna take a miracle
to make me look normal,

07:43.133 --> 07:45.400
but they are the best doctors,

07:45.400 --> 07:48.400
and if anybody can do it,
I totally trust them to do it.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.667
- So this all started with

07:50.667 --> 07:53.100
a simple
breast augmentation, right?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.166
- Yeah.

07:54.166 --> 07:57.600
I decided to treat myself
to breasts for my birthday.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.200
This was actually last summer.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.266
- Okay.
- The very next day,

08:02.266 --> 08:03.266
the left breast

08:03.266 --> 08:06.400
was swollen up twice the size
of the right breast,

08:06.400 --> 08:08.333
and the nipple
was turning purple.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.533
- Hematoma?
- Hematoma.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.500
- So I went back to her,
and she said,

08:13.500 --> 08:16.266
"Why don't you
come back Friday?

08:16.266 --> 08:17.233
I've got surgery all day,

08:17.233 --> 08:19.166
but if you get to
the hospital early enough,

08:19.166 --> 08:21.700
I'll take a look to see
what's going on."

08:21.700 --> 08:24.266
- That's a surgical emergency
that is now pressing

08:24.266 --> 08:27.633
on the underside of your nipple,
cutting off the blood supply,

08:27.633 --> 08:30.367
and potentially
the surrounding breast tissue.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.700
There are a few absolutes
in medicine surgery,

08:32.700 --> 08:34.567
and one of the most
significant is that

08:34.567 --> 08:36.100
when you get
a collection of blood

08:36.100 --> 08:37.200
in a pocket in the body,

08:37.200 --> 08:40.300
you go right to the operating
room, and you remove it.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.166
And the nipple was turning
darker this whole time?

08:43.166 --> 08:46.300
- The nipple was black
at this point and crusting over.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.567
And the incisions themselves
are bursting open at this point

08:50.567 --> 08:52.300
and oozing and bleeding.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.433
And she looked,
and she said,

08:54.433 --> 08:58.500
"That's gonna absorb itself.
You're gonna be fine."

08:58.500 --> 09:00.467
I knew it was infected.

09:00.467 --> 09:05.333
I could smell the infection,
and I just trusted her.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.667
So I go to see my family doctor,

09:07.667 --> 09:09.667
and the second
I took my shirt off...

09:09.667 --> 09:11.300
- She freaked out.
- She freaked.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.333
- Of course she did.
- "You have MRSA."

09:13.333 --> 09:15.467
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God. You had MRSA.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.667
- You didn't go to a surgeon.
You went to an assassin.

09:18.667 --> 09:22.700
- If the MRSA became that severe
that it eats through the muscles

09:22.700 --> 09:25.333
and then the tissue
overlying the ribcage,

09:25.333 --> 09:27.467
it could have got down
to the heart.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.066
Obviously, that would not
have been good.

09:30.066 --> 09:31.300
- We did the surgery.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.333
I had them remove
both of the implants.

10:32.533 --> 10:37.000

it's all about tissue quality.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.133
Tissue thickness.

10:38.133 --> 10:39.333
So let's look at this one.

10:39.333 --> 10:42.533
This one has well-healed
lift scars.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.367
You actually have a good amount
of breast tissue.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.133
You lack upper fullness.

10:46.133 --> 10:49.500
We can make this one look
very good very easily.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.667
It's all about,
"What can we do with this one?"

10:51.667 --> 10:56.133
Because, essentially, because of
your soft tissue infections,

10:56.133 --> 10:59.667
you've lost the lower insertions
of your pec major,

10:59.667 --> 11:03.000
so you have no pectoralis
muscle in the lower half

11:03.000 --> 11:04.066
where we normally
would have that.

11:04.066 --> 11:07.400
That's what's giving her
that concave depression

11:07.400 --> 11:08.700
in the lower part of her chest

11:08.700 --> 11:12.400
and makes the reconstruction
very difficult.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.033
What we have to do is find a way

11:14.033 --> 11:17.433
to get you a breast mound
that won't get infected,

11:17.433 --> 11:21.100
won't kill the overlying tissue
the way it happened before.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.533
Not easy.

11:22.533 --> 11:26.300
However, this is not
our first rodeo.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.100
This is what we do.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.633
I think we can actually give you

11:29.633 --> 11:33.433
a good-looking left breast.

11:33.433 --> 11:37.033
And then we will make you
an areola and a nipple

11:37.033 --> 11:39.433
that looks as good
as the other side.

11:39.433 --> 11:43.000
Just as long as we don't
run into a complication,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.667
but I can promise you,
if we run into a complication,

11:45.667 --> 11:49.066

because you're at high risk,

11:49.066 --> 11:51.600

17:46.333 --> 17:49.200

it was straight,

did a septoplasty, do you?

18:23.033 --> 18:23.700

18:23.700 --> 18:25.633
- Cosmetically a few things
happening.

18:25.633 --> 18:29.700
There's a dissociation
between the bones

18:29.700 --> 18:30.633
and the lower half of your nose.

18:30.633 --> 18:33.300
- Clearly.
- So the lower half of your nose

18:33.300 --> 18:34.500
is made out of cartilage,

18:34.500 --> 18:36.200
so we're gonna work
on getting it straight.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.600
Now the tip--that's
the hardest part.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.700
Your tip is a little bit
narrow here.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.000
I want to make it
a little bit wider.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.266

18:46.633 --> 18:49.266
- Yeah.
- I think if you had your nose

18:49.266 --> 18:52.500
rotated up and dropped back,
you wouldn't even be in here.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.667
- Right.

18:53.667 --> 18:54.734
- This is a revision
rhinoplasty,

18:54.734 --> 18:58.100
so that means there's more risks
associated with this:

18:58.100 --> 19:00.633
infection, bleeding.

19:00.633 --> 19:03.100
- It's very scary to hear
about the risks,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.100
especially now that I'm older.

19:05.100 --> 19:05.533
- What do you think?

19:05.533 --> 19:07.333
- I'm all in if you are.

19:07.333 --> 19:11.266
But I am hopeful that the reward
will outweigh the risks.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.400
- Well, we look forward
to seeing you.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.633
- Thank you.
- Nice meeting you.

called Witch Nose

I am going to
get my breasts back

19:34.433 --> 19:37.033
and look like a woman again.

19:37.033 --> 19:38.300

- Hello.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.033
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

19:40.033 --> 19:41.533

19:42.633 --> 19:45.433
- Okay. Good, because
we have things to talk about.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.533
So you have a couple
of unique situations

19:47.533 --> 19:50.100
that we don't
normally deal with.

19:50.100 --> 19:53.166
You lost the left breast
and the left nipple,

19:53.166 --> 19:56.433
and you had that really bad
flesh-eating disease.

19:56.433 --> 19:58.633
And you have that muscle issue

19:58.633 --> 20:01.100
where you have
part of the muscle.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.567
Mathematics are what
this case is all about,

20:03.567 --> 20:06.066
because there is
a major size difference

20:06.066 --> 20:07.166
between the two breasts.

20:07.166 --> 20:10.033
The left breast
essentially has no tissue,

20:10.033 --> 20:14.200
so I have to find a way
to get both symmetry,

20:14.200 --> 20:18.200
three-dimensionality,
and a shape.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.333
For Jessica's surgery today,
I am going to start

20:20.333 --> 20:22.533
by making an incision
in her right areola

20:22.533 --> 20:24.333
and then elevate the pocket.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.600
Next, I will remove
any unwanted scar tissue

20:26.600 --> 20:28.333
and put in a new implant.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.533
Then I'll explore the left side

20:29.533 --> 20:32.066
and determine how much muscle
and breast tissue

20:32.066 --> 20:33.200
I have to work with.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.066
I'll create a new breast pocket

20:35.066 --> 20:37.066
and insert
a high-profile implant

20:37.066 --> 20:39.066
while hoping to achieve
breast symmetry.

20:39.066 --> 20:41.333
Okay, so did
the vancomycin go in?

20:41.333 --> 20:42.600
- Vancomycin was in.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.000
- So hopefully
any dormant bacteria

20:46.000 --> 20:49.767
in the left breast
has been obliterated.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.200
One of the main concerns
with Jessica

20:51.200 --> 20:53.100
is that she had
a very significant

20:53.100 --> 20:55.500
MRSA bacterial infection.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.600
I'm gonna give what's called
prophylactic antibiotics

20:58.600 --> 21:00.500
in high doses preoperatively,

21:00.500 --> 21:03.066
to hopefully kill
any dormant bacteria

21:03.066 --> 21:05.767
that I may run into
during the surgical procedure.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.100
[sighs]

21:07.100 --> 21:08.233
Okay.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.500
- One sigh.
- Start the sigh count.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.033
- Start the sigh count.

21:11.033 --> 21:13.633
- The more surgical stress,
the more difficult the case,

21:13.633 --> 21:16.633
the greater the number
of sighs per minute.

21:16.633 --> 21:19.200
Is this the pec major or minor?

21:19.200 --> 21:23.567
That flesh-eating disease ate
the lower part of her pec major,

21:23.567 --> 21:25.567
so this must be the minor.

21:25.567 --> 21:29.400
Maybe I can combine parts
of the minor with the major.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.533
If I can elevate up
the pectoralis minor muscle

21:32.533 --> 21:36.133
and attach it to
the pectoralis major muscle,

21:36.133 --> 21:37.633
I can get potentially good,

21:37.633 --> 21:40.100
normal contour and coverage

21:40.100 --> 21:41.533
over a breast implant.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.233
[sighs]

21:43.233 --> 21:44.633
There's another one.

21:44.633 --> 21:47.133
The sigh-per-second count
is going up.

21:47.133 --> 21:52.066
So I think we're gonna use
a 300 cc moderate profile

21:52.066 --> 21:53.233
on the right,

21:53.233 --> 21:58.600
and let's use an extra-high
profile 500-ish on the left.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.000
Because Jess' right breast
has so much more breast tissue,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.500
I'm gonna have to put
a correspondingly larger

22:04.500 --> 22:05.667
implant on her left

22:05.667 --> 22:11.133
and a smaller one on her right,
in order to achieve symmetry.

22:11.133 --> 22:12.133
Okay. Can we sit her up?

22:12.133 --> 22:14.567
- Mm-hmm.
- Here it is.

22:14.567 --> 22:19.033
The moment of truth.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.100
- Yeah.
- They are sisters.

22:21.100 --> 22:24.667
- Mm-hmm.
- They're not identical twins,

22:24.667 --> 22:28.133
but they definitely have
the same mother and father.

22:28.133 --> 22:29.166
I'm really happy with this.

22:29.166 --> 22:31.700
With a 480 cc implant
on the left

22:31.700 --> 22:34.266
and a 300 cc implant
on the right,

22:34.266 --> 22:36.533
I've got pretty good symmetry
going in Jessica.

22:36.533 --> 22:37.667
If I can just get her to heal,

22:37.667 --> 22:42.367
and hopefully she won't develop
any untoward infections,

22:42.367 --> 22:45.533
I may end up having
a really nice result today.

22:45.533 --> 22:47.300
All right. Thank you.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.266

22:49.266 --> 22:52.233

to a silicone-injected area

22:52.233 --> 22:56.133

23:32.066 --> 23:34.233
Goodbye, nose.

23:34.233 --> 23:37.066

Welcome to the OR.

23:37.066 --> 23:39.567
- The most challenging part
of today's surgery

23:39.567 --> 23:42.100
is how far do we have
to lift up that tip?

23:42.100 --> 23:45.066
Because if we lift
it up too much,

23:45.066 --> 23:46.233
is it gonna drop
a little bit within a month?

23:46.233 --> 23:48.633
Or if we don't do it enough,
is the nose gonna be too long?

23:48.633 --> 23:51.100
So it's a fine balancing act,

23:51.100 --> 23:52.300
and we're just gonna have
to see what we gotta do.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.633
To fix Shannon's nose,
my team will harvest rib

23:54.633 --> 23:56.333
while I make a small incision

23:56.333 --> 23:57.767
underneath the nose
to open it up.

23:57.767 --> 24:00.233
I will use a rasp
to remove the nasal hump,

24:00.233 --> 24:02.600
and then I will fracture her
nasal bones with osteotomies,

24:02.600 --> 24:04.433
to fix the open roof deformity.

24:04.433 --> 24:06.500
I will use the rib
to make spreader grafts

24:06.500 --> 24:08.233
which will make
the middle vault wider

24:08.233 --> 24:10.033
and a septal extension graft

24:10.033 --> 24:11.500
to lower the entire tip
of the nose,

24:11.500 --> 24:15.100
leaving Shannon with
a softer overall appearance.

24:15.100 --> 24:17.533
Okay, so here comes the rib.

24:17.533 --> 24:19.633
Well, that's a long
piece of rib.

24:19.633 --> 24:22.000
Okay. Thank you.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.600
There's some scar tissue
in the tip.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.133
I think that's scar tissue.
I think that's a graft.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.266
I don't even know.

24:28.266 --> 24:29.533
It's hard. It's thick.

24:29.533 --> 24:31.533
There's no great tissue planes.

24:31.533 --> 24:34.633
We just have to be lucky.

24:34.633 --> 24:37.100
Oh, oh, oh.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.266
Small poke through the skin.
There's nothing I can do.

24:39.266 --> 24:42.100
I mean I gotta get it off, and
there's no other plane there.

24:42.100 --> 24:46.367
It's like dissecting between,
you know, two pieces of cement.

24:46.367 --> 24:48.500
When you're dissecting
through intense,

24:48.500 --> 24:49.633
hard scar tissue,

24:49.633 --> 24:51.367
you take whatever you can
and cut through it.

24:51.367 --> 24:53.000
Remove enough so that
it doesn't hurt

24:53.000 --> 24:55.400
the actual viability
of the skin,

24:55.400 --> 24:57.133
and then reconstruct the nose.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.667
Okay, let's go in
and do some rasping.

24:58.667 --> 25:01.266
The bone on the left.
Just a little bit too tall.

25:01.266 --> 25:03.133
Let me just take that
down a little bit.

25:03.133 --> 25:04.500
Rasping is like filing.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.433
So you basically
have a file, a nail,

25:07.433 --> 25:11.400
and you go like that
to smooth things out.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.567
Mallet?

25:12.567 --> 25:14.300
Okay.
Let's fracture the bones.

[hammer tapping]

25:20.433 --> 25:22.433
That's about it.
As I feel this tip,

25:22.433 --> 25:25.100
I originally thought
there was cartilage in it.

25:25.100 --> 25:28.033
Like a strap, but there isn't.
It just is fallen.

25:28.033 --> 25:31.233
It's always scary elevating
or lifting a nasal tip,

25:31.233 --> 25:33.000
because I have
to over-rotate it,

25:33.000 --> 25:34.233
because it is gonna drop a bit.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.433
And then if we do that,
and it doesn't come down,

25:36.433 --> 25:38.533
then you have
a piggy nose, like this.

25:38.533 --> 25:41.066
And then if you don't do enough,
and then it drops,

25:41.066 --> 25:43.200
then you're back to
where you started from.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.467
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

25:44.467 --> 25:47.033

you're here

27:35.066 --> 27:39.133
because you've had
a series of injections. Yes?

27:39.133 --> 27:40.266
- Yes.

27:40.266 --> 27:45.033
- What possessed you to do--
- Well, I was very young.

27:45.033 --> 27:47.567
I started getting work done,
and all of my injections,

27:47.567 --> 27:50.133
my silicone injections,
when I was about 18 years old.

27:50.133 --> 27:52.400
And I've just never been able
to get an ass before,

27:52.400 --> 27:54.400
and I want higher cheeks.
I want bigger lips.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.400
This seems like a very easy,

27:56.400 --> 27:58.133
inexpensive way

27:58.133 --> 27:59.633
to remedy those issues.

27:59.633 --> 28:01.166
- Multiple things can happen

28:01.166 --> 28:03.300
with silicone
injected in your body,

28:03.300 --> 28:05.033
and it can cause deformities.

28:05.033 --> 28:06.500
It can get in
your blood vessels,

28:06.500 --> 28:08.166
and this can happen
5 years, 10 years,

28:08.166 --> 28:10.567
25 years down the line.
You never know.

28:10.567 --> 28:13.567
- As I was getting everything
else, I wanted to have abdomens

28:13.567 --> 28:16.500
where they were more defined
and more pronounced.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.300
- So you wanted to inject
a six pack?

28:18.300 --> 28:20.166
- So I wanted to inject
a six pack.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.300
- But let me just interrupt you.

28:21.300 --> 28:24.567
You wanted to get
feminizing injections,

28:24.567 --> 28:28.333
but you don't want
to transition at all?

28:28.333 --> 28:31.200
- No. I wanted to kind of find
this weird medium

28:31.200 --> 28:33.033
where I'm feminine
but also masculine.

28:33.033 --> 28:34.166
Like, I have pecs.

28:34.166 --> 28:36.066
- Androgyny.
- Like, very--yeah.

28:36.066 --> 28:39.066
I wanted to be very androgynous
and very fluid with my gender.

28:39.066 --> 28:39.734
- Okay.
- And I still do.

28:39.734 --> 28:41.266
- How is it
affecting you negatively?

28:41.266 --> 28:42.600
- Well, as a man,

28:42.600 --> 28:44.333
and as a gay man, obviously,

28:44.333 --> 28:46.567
I want to get naked
all the time.

28:46.567 --> 28:50.333
And as a drag performer, I want
to get naked all the time.

28:50.333 --> 28:52.300
- When you're being a man,
and you're in a club

28:52.300 --> 28:55.000
you're in a social situation,
and you're gay.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.333
- Right.
- Shirt comes off, right?

28:56.333 --> 28:58.400
Go to a white party.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.066
What percent of people
have their shirts off?

29:00.066 --> 29:02.000
- All of them.
- A what party?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.066
- You know nothing.
- No.

29:03.066 --> 29:04.567
I don't. I don't know
anything about that stuff.

29:04.567 --> 29:06.333
- He just knows plastic surgery.
That's it.

29:06.333 --> 29:09.333
- I'm a little taken aback
at how well-versed

29:09.333 --> 29:12.100
in the gay community
Dr. Dubrow is.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.300
He knew about white party.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.467
He knew that everyone wants

29:14.467 --> 29:15.633
to take their shirts
off at gay clubs.

29:15.633 --> 29:19.033
I'm like, "Maybe I've seen him
in a gay club a time or two."

29:19.033 --> 29:21.066
But that'll just be
our little secret.

29:21.066 --> 29:25.066
- We obviously have a--now-
significant experience

29:25.066 --> 29:26.367
helping people

29:26.367 --> 29:28.233
with these problems
from silicone injections.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.633
- That's why I wanted
to come here.

29:29.633 --> 29:32.333
- I know, but there's always
this threat of, you know,

29:32.333 --> 29:35.467
what we call waking the sleeping
dragon when you do these things,

29:35.467 --> 29:39.033
because doing something
to a silicone-injected area

29:39.033 --> 29:42.500
can induce a very significant
inflammatory reaction.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.233
And you get a whole granulomas/
foreign body situation

29:45.233 --> 29:47.633
that can be a disaster,
you know?

29:47.633 --> 29:50.266
So not to scare you.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.533
- I'm scared.
- [laughs] Too late.

29:52.533 --> 29:54.600
- But that's what goes on
in our minds

29:54.600 --> 29:58.200
when we see patients
who have problems

29:58.200 --> 30:00.633
who want, potentially,
our help.

30:00.633 --> 30:04.100
So I think it's time
to go examine you,

30:04.100 --> 30:07.233
and see what's cooking, and see
what we can offer you. Shall we?

30:07.233 --> 30:08.633
- Let's go do it.
- Let's do it.

30:08.633 --> 30:11.500
- Dee has a large amount
of silicone injected

30:11.500 --> 30:13.100
in various parts of the body.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.266
At a moment's notice,

30:14.266 --> 30:18.133
any of those can be like
waking a Pandora's Box

30:18.133 --> 30:21.233
and really turn into
a major problem for Dee.

30:24.266 --> 30:29.300
- Unfortunately, I've had
another MRSA infection.

30:34.633 --> 30:38.033
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

30:38.033 --> 30:41.033

of people

30:41.033 --> 30:44.033

body implants/injections,

30:44.033 --> 30:46.367
but I don't think we've
met anyone who's had injections

30:46.367 --> 30:48.133
all throughout
their body, like you.

30:48.133 --> 30:50.100
So if you don't mind,
I'd actually like to sort of

30:50.100 --> 30:51.367
examine the various parts

30:51.367 --> 30:52.700
and see what's
going on with them.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.433
So you had some injections
to your arms, yes?

30:54.433 --> 30:56.233
- Yes.
- Where?

30:56.233 --> 30:59.233
- Like, right in here.
- Huh.

30:59.233 --> 31:02.233
- But just, like,
a tiny little bit.

31:02.233 --> 31:04.033
- So maybe that.
- Except right there.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.500
- Mm-hmm.
- [chuckles]

31:05.500 --> 31:09.300
Wow.
It's really filled, but it's--

31:09.300 --> 31:11.266
- It's very bouncy.
- Yeah. I know.

31:11.266 --> 31:15.333
I mean this is one of the,
sort of, best I've ever seen.

31:15.333 --> 31:18.200
- He's moving his fingers and
squeezing all my little bits.

31:18.200 --> 31:22.200
That makes me feel really great.

31:22.200 --> 31:26.433
- Wow. You have a lot.
- A lot.

31:26.433 --> 31:28.533
- 'Cause that's like
a 500 cc implant.

31:28.533 --> 31:31.200
As I'm feeling
Matthew's various areas

31:31.200 --> 31:32.600
that he's had
silicone injection,

31:32.600 --> 31:36.300
I'm assessing him for
any inflammatory nodules,

31:36.300 --> 31:39.600
and his body
has actually very well

31:39.600 --> 31:44.133
tolerated the relatively large
amount of free silicone

31:44.133 --> 31:45.467
that he's injected.

31:45.467 --> 31:48.333
He's actually very, very lucky.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.333
The good news is, it's soft.

31:50.333 --> 31:53.333
They're not inflamed.
There is a solution.

31:53.333 --> 31:55.633
- Mm-hmm.
- I would make an incision

31:55.633 --> 31:58.500
that goes hip to hip--I know,

31:58.500 --> 32:00.767
but it's below
the underwear--and

32:00.767 --> 32:02.367
elevate up the skin.

32:02.367 --> 32:05.500
All the way up
to the chest wall here.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.066
- Mm-hmm.

32:07.066 --> 32:10.767
- And then from the inside
remove these.

32:10.767 --> 32:13.767
And then I would basically
do what's called

32:13.767 --> 32:15.500
a skin-only tummy tuck on you

32:15.500 --> 32:19.600
which is to remove the skin
from the belly button down.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.066
And it's a big scar with
a very significant recovery,

32:23.066 --> 32:26.100
so basically you're down
for several weeks.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.767
- I came in here
with the expectation

32:27.767 --> 32:33.100
of hopefully a quick fix
for my aesthetic issue,

32:33.100 --> 32:35.367
and now we're talking
a completely different story.

32:35.367 --> 32:38.133
- So I think this is relatively

32:38.133 --> 32:39.533
actually quite low risk.
- Schedule.

32:39.533 --> 32:41.367
- I'm getting a little
emotional, because this is,

32:41.367 --> 32:44.133
like--I thought it was
gonna be something...

32:44.133 --> 32:46.100
- Much easier?
- No. Much worse.

32:46.100 --> 32:47.400
I've been very worried
about the silicone,

32:47.400 --> 32:49.333
just because
there is so much...

32:49.333 --> 32:50.500
- Bad.
- Bad news out there.

32:50.500 --> 32:53.633
And to hear that I'm that lucky
and as lucky as I thought

32:53.633 --> 32:56.133
I have been for years
is very good news.

32:56.133 --> 32:58.266
Hearing Dr. Dubrow say
that I'm at very low risk

32:58.266 --> 33:01.467
of having any kind of
complication is amazing news.

33:01.467 --> 33:05.600
It's like--I can take my tits
out and relax now.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.000
That's amazing to hear,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.266
and I would love
to explore that option.

33:11.266 --> 33:13.066
Unfortunately, I can't
do that right now,

33:13.066 --> 33:16.000
'cause I can't afford
to not be on the road.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.100
I'm literally booked
and contracted into gigs for,

33:18.100 --> 33:19.633
like, the next year.

33:19.633 --> 33:22.500
As soon as I can get some time
off, I'm gonna call Dr. Dubrow

33:22.500 --> 33:24.367

"Let's get it on the books.

33:24.367 --> 33:26.500

these puppies out."

But you tell everyone
who comes to you

33:37.633 --> 33:41.400

not to do this, all right?

33:41.400 --> 33:43.567

- That's good.

33:43.567 --> 33:45.233

- Yes.

the family to get a tummy tuck.

34:07.033 --> 34:10.166
- I wish I could say
everything is going great,

34:10.166 --> 34:16.533
but unfortunately I've
had another MRSA infection.

34:16.533 --> 34:20.333
I think it was probably about
a month after the surgery

34:20.333 --> 34:23.333
that I noticed
some really weird spots

34:23.333 --> 34:25.266
in different parts of my body.

34:25.266 --> 34:27.333
So I ended up
in the emergency room

34:27.333 --> 34:30.066
where I was told
that the MRSA was back.

34:30.066 --> 34:35.133
I never imagined that
I would be facing this again.

34:35.133 --> 34:38.133
I had hoped this last surgery
was the last,

34:38.133 --> 34:41.467
but it seems we're going
to need another one.

34:41.467 --> 34:46.100
The left breast has been
sliding underneath my armpit.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.767
It's just not
in a stable position.

34:48.767 --> 34:51.200
This one.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.600
There it goes.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.500
I know that the MRSA

34:54.500 --> 34:57.767
severely damaged my pec muscles
to begin with,

34:57.767 --> 35:01.367
and that's to blame
for my current issue.

35:01.367 --> 35:04.367
I'm just hoping Dr. Dubrow can
find me a permanent solution.

35:04.367 --> 35:05.367
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:05.367 --> 35:06.500
- How are you?
- Good.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.100
- Good to see you.
- You too.

35:08.100 --> 35:12.233
- Okay, so we had a little
complication, right?

35:12.233 --> 35:13.367
- Yeah.

35:13.367 --> 35:14.367
- Obviously,
all those infections

35:14.367 --> 35:15.567
and everything ate up...

35:15.567 --> 35:17.333
- Yeah.
- The muscle.

35:17.333 --> 35:19.767
The muscle that I tried
to put together

35:19.767 --> 35:22.600
was obviously too weak
to hold the implant in,

35:22.600 --> 35:27.000
and so now we have
to fix the complication.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.200
Jessica's infection clearly
undid my original surgery,

35:31.200 --> 35:35.000
and I'm concerned that any
further surgery could be undone

35:35.000 --> 35:37.266
by a recurrent MRSA infection.

35:37.266 --> 35:40.066
But knowing that she was
treated in the emergency room

35:40.066 --> 35:43.000
with the appropriate
antibiotics probably means

35:43.000 --> 35:45.533
that we won't be seeing
this infection again.

35:45.533 --> 35:49.000
At the very least,
my fingers are crossed.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.100
So what I have to do
is create a wall out of tissue

35:53.100 --> 35:56.266
to prevent the implant from
falling down into her armpit.

35:56.266 --> 35:58.066
The reason it occurred
at the original surgery

35:58.066 --> 36:00.266
is because her MRSA infection

36:00.266 --> 36:02.467
obviously ate
all of the soft tissue

36:02.467 --> 36:04.600
in this area and weakened it.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.433
But now that the implant's
been in for a while,

36:07.433 --> 36:09.233
hopefully there's enough
scar tissue around it

36:09.233 --> 36:10.767
that I can use that.

36:10.767 --> 36:14.033
Okay, so she has formed
some good scar tissue here

36:14.033 --> 36:17.000
that I can theoretically
rotate down.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.266
Usually scar tissue in
the breast is your worst enemy,

36:20.266 --> 36:24.033
but in this special case
it's actually the best solution.

36:24.033 --> 36:26.100
Hopefully,
there's enough scar tissue

36:26.100 --> 36:27.567
in Jessica's breast pocket

36:27.567 --> 36:29.500
that I can actually use it

36:29.500 --> 36:32.567
to build
and reinforce a strong wall.

36:32.567 --> 36:34.567
That's a pretty stable wall.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.000
It's like the great wall
of Terry.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.300
- Hmm.
- Could you sit her up?

36:38.300 --> 36:41.767
- Mm-hmm.
- The outer wall is closed off.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.400
Provided we don't get infection

36:43.400 --> 36:45.033
and the wall isn't
broken down any further,

36:45.033 --> 36:48.033
that should remain intact,
so fingers crossed.

36:48.033 --> 36:49.367
Okay. Awesome.

where you're at.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.033
Let me see.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.467
Are they soft?

37:18.467 --> 37:20.166
- Yeah.

37:20.166 --> 37:22.066
- Did the repair hold?
- Yeah.

37:22.066 --> 37:24.066
It's holding so well.
- Good.

37:24.066 --> 37:26.734
- Like, it feels
incredibly stable.

37:26.734 --> 37:30.233
I even started, like,
chest pressing last week.

37:30.233 --> 37:32.367
- It's good to see that
Jessica's surgery site

37:32.367 --> 37:33.367
has remained very stable.

37:33.367 --> 37:37.033
There's no evidence of any MRSA
re-infection,

37:37.033 --> 37:38.767
and she's doing really well.

37:38.767 --> 37:41.100
From my point of view,
you have good symmetry.

37:41.100 --> 37:45.200
You have stable implants/foreign
bodies in place.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.100
You have no signs
of an infection.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.633
You need a nipple.
- Yeah.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.333
- That's all you need
is a nipple.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.166
- I have been waiting
for this day

37:52.166 --> 37:53.734
for a very, very long time.

37:53.734 --> 37:56.200
It has been about two years

37:56.200 --> 37:59.200
since I've seen myself
with two nipples.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.100
- Jason is the man.
- Magic nipple man.

38:01.100 --> 38:03.033
- He's the magic nipple man.
- I'll take care of you.

38:03.033 --> 38:06.433
- Yeah, so let me show you
what's going on, okay?

38:06.433 --> 38:07.500
- Absolutely.

38:07.500 --> 38:11.233
- We reconstructed this one.
Isn't that a great breast?

38:11.233 --> 38:12.133
- Great job.

38:12.133 --> 38:14.367
- Yeah, and then just
as a little bonus

38:14.367 --> 38:17.000
he's gonna put a little
tattoo there of my face.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Right there.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
[laughter]

38:20.000 --> 38:21.266
Of me going like this.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.233
[laughter]

38:23.233 --> 38:27.467
- Having Dr. Dubrow as my doctor
has been the biggest blessing.

38:27.467 --> 38:31.000
I knew that there were
risks and complications

38:31.000 --> 38:32.600
going into these surgeries.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.600
But I was fully confident
if something should happen,

38:35.600 --> 38:37.600
I'd be in the best hands.

38:37.600 --> 38:42.066
And through to the end,
he has been amazing.

38:45.266 --> 38:47.000
Oh, wow.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.066
Before my surgery,

38:48.066 --> 38:49.467
my left breast looked like

38:49.467 --> 38:52.633
it was eaten by the MRSA shark.

38:52.633 --> 38:54.567
I was extremely lopsided,

38:54.567 --> 38:56.500
and as hard as I tried,

38:56.500 --> 39:00.166
I could not build myself
a breast at the gym.

39:00.166 --> 39:03.000
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

39:03.000 --> 39:05.433
I can finally say
that I'm MRSA-free.

39:05.433 --> 39:09.567
I have symmetric breasts
with matching areolas.

39:09.567 --> 39:11.433
I am very grateful
for where I'm at.

39:11.433 --> 39:14.166
And they aren't perfect,

39:14.166 --> 39:17.033
but I feel feminine again,

39:17.033 --> 39:20.000
and I'm going to wear
my scars proudly.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.700
- You've come a long way.

39:20.700 --> 39:23.166
I hope it stays like this
for a long time.

39:23.166 --> 39:24.433
Congratulations.

39:24.433 --> 39:26.533
You've got pretty breasts,
and pretty is good,

39:26.533 --> 39:27.567
'cause you're
a pretty girl, okay?

39:27.567 --> 39:28.433
- Thank you.

39:28.433 --> 39:31.033
I'm feeling very strong,
both mentally

39:31.033 --> 39:31.433
and physically now.

39:31.433 --> 39:33.033
- Eh?
- I love it.

39:33.033 --> 39:34.133
- Congratulations.

39:34.133 --> 39:36.200
- Thank you.
- You look great.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.467
- This being your third surgery,

39:38.467 --> 39:40.266
you have a little bit
of an area here

39:40.266 --> 39:42.467
where it's a little
bit purplish.

I'm a little sore.

39:58.133 --> 40:01.033

40:01.033 --> 40:03.066
- Yeah. A little bit there.

40:03.066 --> 40:06.467

through the swelling right now,

it's in a better position.

All right, so your surgery
went fantastic.

40:24.033 --> 40:27.567
We actually really did
some great work on your nose,

40:27.567 --> 40:29.433
and I want to take a peek now.

40:29.433 --> 40:32.467
Overall, for day one, I'm very
happy with Shannon's nose.

40:32.467 --> 40:34.767
I like the rotation.
I like the way it looks.

40:43.166 --> 40:45.767
The blood supply
is not that fantastic.

40:45.767 --> 40:47.233
- Okay.
- I had a little friend

40:47.233 --> 40:48.433
come over who's gonna help us.

40:48.433 --> 40:49.567
- Okay.

40:49.567 --> 40:53.233
- And we call her
the Leech Lady.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.166
- I'm not afraid of bugs
and critters.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.400
In South Carolina, we have
our share of big critters.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.533
But leeches on my face

40:59.533 --> 41:02.333
is not something
I'm looking forward to.

41:02.333 --> 41:04.133
- They suck out the blood.

41:04.133 --> 41:05.533
We need to free
all that blood out of there.

41:05.533 --> 41:06.533
- Okay.

41:06.533 --> 41:08.200
- And that's gonna help
decrease your swelling

41:08.200 --> 41:09.333
and help improve
the circulation.

41:09.333 --> 41:11.533
I'm gonna do something
special for Shannon.

41:11.533 --> 41:13.400
I'm gonna give her
two extra leeches.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.133
One for each side,
and that's gonna help

41:15.133 --> 41:17.000
get rid of
some of that bruising.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.100
- Oh, my God.
It does sting a little.

41:20.100 --> 41:21.100
- It stings a little bit?

41:21.100 --> 41:22.100
- Mm-hmm.

41:22.100 --> 41:24.266

about Beverly Hills

41:28.000 --> 41:30.266
she thinks
about designer shopping,

41:30.266 --> 41:32.000
the best restaurants.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.500
The last thing
she probably thinks about

41:33.500 --> 41:35.400
is having a leech on her face.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.767
Sorry.
