WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.293
* Let's fall in love

00:03.330 --> 00:06.037
* Why shouldn't we
fall in love? *

00:09.810 --> 00:13.371
* Let's fall in love...

00:13.410 --> 00:15.105
AL:
This is it-- 872.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.141
CARRIE:
You're kidding.

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
AL:
Why

00:17.550 --> 00:19.814
I... I think it's beautiful.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.078
I'm just...

00:21.120 --> 00:22.587
Wow.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.611
What do you say we ofﬁcially
christen the place?

00:24.650 --> 00:27.357
Do you mean carry me
over the threshold?

00:27.390 --> 00:29.324
If you're gonna do something,
do it right.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.520
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:33.560 --> 00:34.549
Don't drop me.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.806
I've always wanted
to live in a brownstone.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.159
And now you do.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.179
And now I do.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.575
Look at this.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.475
Mm-hmm.
Careful.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.512
Our fancy neighbors
will see.

00:52.550 --> 00:54.438
That's the idea.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.846
You know...

00:56.890 --> 00:59.415
this whole marriage
thing isn't so bad.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.348
* Let's fall in love.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.227
AL:
Hey, can you hear me?

01:09.270 --> 01:10.464
CARRIE :
I would hear you better

01:10.500 --> 01:12.365
if you'd stopped shouting.
Where are you?

01:12.400 --> 01:14.595
That Japanese place on Green
with the amazing sushi

01:14.640 --> 01:17.359
where we went after we closed
the Burrell case.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.334
Yashin, yes, and it was after
the Zuniga case, actually.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.472
Right, so what did I get again?

01:21.510 --> 01:23.808
It was some kind of roll
with, uh, sea eel and something.

01:23.850 --> 01:24.839
What am I?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.211
Your personal Zagat guide?

01:26.250 --> 01:27.444
Come on, I know you remember.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.617
It's almost my turn.

01:28.650 --> 01:29.617
Fine, fine, fine.

01:29.650 --> 01:31.288
You ordered a dragon roll,
which, by the way,

01:31.320 --> 01:32.309
no self-respecting
sushi lover would...

01:32.360 --> 01:34.783
Now, wait. I liked
what you had with the sauce.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.879
Shinko. River fish.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.954
River fish. Got it.

01:37.990 --> 01:40.424
Remember you kept leaning
across the table to get

01:40.460 --> 01:42.223
at mine, and you got
a stain on your tie,

01:42.270 --> 01:44.226
which, by the way,
was an improvement on that tie.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.521
Thank you.

01:45.570 --> 01:46.696
Did you want something?

01:46.740 --> 01:48.628
Yeah, I want river fish.

01:48.670 --> 01:49.705
Hold on. I got a call.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.230
There you go.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.329
Can I help you?

01:53.380 --> 01:54.438
Al Burns.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.540
Got it. On my way.

01:57.580 --> 01:59.571
Mister, you want
to order or not?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.576
Next time.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.884
Hey, can you meet me somewhere?

02:07.290 --> 02:09.349
(camera shutter clicks,
garbled radio transmission)

02:09.390 --> 02:11.881
MAN:
Victims are, uh,
Glen and Ianna Truman.

02:11.930 --> 02:15.388
Married, two kids
in college.

02:15.430 --> 02:18.467
He's some kind of ad exec,
she works for the Guggenheim.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.832
Only things missing
are the wedding rings.

02:20.870 --> 02:23.703
Just like the others, huh?
Yep.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.504
Just like the others?
VVhat

02:26.540 --> 02:27.768
_ Excuse me
Just one second.

02:27.810 --> 02:28.902
Yeah.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.376
Three and a half years ago,
Green and I worked homicide

02:32.420 --> 02:33.842
together in Queens.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.745
We had two cases
Just lIke this one.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.714
Husband and wife,
affluent like this.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.615
Killed like this.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.287
Wedding rings gone, too.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.254
Any suspects?

02:43.290 --> 02:44.484
AL:
No arrests, nothing.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.498
All we had--
matching ballistics from

02:46.530 --> 02:48.293
a .40-caliber.
Then, a few months in,

02:48.330 --> 02:51.595
we found out about two other
couples-- Columbus, Ohio, 2008.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.393
Same exact M.O.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.862
Two sets of two.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.404
We kept at it,
but the trail went cold.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.476
I guess it's heating up.

03:21.260 --> 03:23.922
Alicia and Harvey Reid-- that's
the first couple we found.

03:23.970 --> 03:27.633
Killed in 2010, both shot
multiple times in the chest.

03:27.670 --> 03:28.568
Married 18 years.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.761
Two beautiful kids.
How was the marriage?

03:30.810 --> 03:32.607
By all accounts,
solid as a rock.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.676
They were both
investment bankers,

03:34.710 --> 03:36.246
on the boards
of a dozen charities.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.008
We_couldn't find
a smgle person

03:37.050 --> 03:38.677
with a bad thing
to say about them.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.348
Yeah, well, someone had
a problem with them.

03:40.380 --> 03:41.779
What's with the missing
wedding rings?

03:41.820 --> 03:43.412
No idea, but in each case,

03:43.450 --> 03:46.248
more expensive jewelry
was left untouched.

03:46.290 --> 03:47.552
Then, one week later,

03:47.590 --> 03:49.455
Lexie and Donald Grant.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.355
Successful art dealers.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.597
Penthouse in Chelsea,
same M.O.

03:53.630 --> 03:54.597
MURRAY:
Killing couples

03:54.630 --> 03:55.756
is a pretty rare

03:55.800 --> 03:57.358
serial killer profile.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.664
I mean, you got the Zodiac
killer out in California.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.258
He killed couples.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.528
Son of Sam
shot at several

04:02.570 --> 04:04.265
couples parked
in their cars.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.800
Yeah, but all those victims
were teenagers,

04:05.840 --> 04:06.875
early 205 at most.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.605
The affluence and age
of these couples

04:08.640 --> 04:10.471
doesn't fit any pattern
we can find.
Mm-hmm.

04:10.510 --> 04:12.046
Murray, if you could get
on the ballistics.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.047
I'm guessing .40-caliber.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.446
With some luck,
we should be able to match them.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.686
You got it.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.711
Burns

04:21.390 --> 04:22.926
AL:
What, it's not major enough

04:22.960 --> 04:24.359
for Major Crimes?

04:24.390 --> 04:25.789
I didn't say that.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.627
I said we had limited resources,

04:27.660 --> 04:28.991
and the choice of how

04:29.030 --> 04:31.066
to allocate those resources
belongs to me.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.897
We're talking about a series
of double homicides

04:32.940 --> 04:34.828
that I believe are related.

04:34.870 --> 04:37.464
I know you have history
with this, but a serial killer

04:37.510 --> 04:38.909
who randomly targets
wealthy middle

04:38.940 --> 04:40.077
Oh, I get it.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.532
It's the headlines, right?

04:41.580 --> 04:43.639
Al, fortunately
and unfortunately,

04:43.680 --> 04:45.477
when we take on a case,

04:45.510 --> 04:47.774
a certain amount of media
attention generally follows.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.447
Yeah, you don't want
your rich friends

04:49.490 --> 04:51.310
waking up to the news
they're being stalked

04:51.350 --> 04:52.510
in their
own homes.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.858
I am simply asking that, despite
your personal convictions,

04:54.890 --> 04:55.857
we not jump to any conclusions.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.721
You don't have to jump
to these conclusions.

04:57.760 --> 04:58.920
They're staring you in the face!

04:58.960 --> 05:00.552
Fine, use the team.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.660
But you got 48 hours to work
this up as a serial killer.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.998
After that, we're gonna dump
it down to Midtown South

05:06.030 --> 05:07.338
as a home invasion homicide.

05:07.370 --> 05:09.065
Fine, but by the way,

05:09.100 --> 05:11.364
you hired me
for my personal convictions.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.401
WEBSTER:
48 hours, really?

05:13.440 --> 05:16.409
I'm gonna have to put
a rush on all my tests.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.099
You know what?
Those lab techs owe me.

05:18.150 --> 05:21.472
I am practically the only one
that goes to their bake sales.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.987
You_have bake sales
In forensrcs?

05:23.020 --> 05:25.409
Oh, you would be
so surprised to see

05:25.450 --> 05:27.918
what a little centrifuging does
to lemon meringue.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.849
Okay, so...
we have the obvious.

05:31.890 --> 05:34.051
Cause of death-- gunshot
wound to the upper

05:34.100 --> 05:38.389
thoracic region caused by
a 40-millimeter projectile.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.863
Markings consistent

05:39.900 --> 05:43.529
with a Sig Sauer
P250 handgun.

05:43.570 --> 05:45.128
Was the same weapon used?

05:45.170 --> 05:46.398
Inconclusive.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.771
But why these
particular couples?

05:47.810 --> 05:49.471
The only connecting factor

05:49.510 --> 05:50.943
is that he takes
their wedding rings.

05:50.980 --> 05:53.141
That's a bonus grab.

05:53.180 --> 05:56.411
Those wedding rings were
probably worth a pretty penny.

05:56.450 --> 05:58.748
So, you got nothing
unusual, Jo?

05:58.790 --> 05:59.984
You know what?

06:00.020 --> 06:01.715
I don't know.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.728
My predecessors in
Queens were not known

06:03.760 --> 06:05.421
for their intellectual
curIOSIty.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.757
Mmm.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.119
Am I being catty?
Mm-hmm.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.162
Oh, good.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.397
Okay, take a look at this
from 2010.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.396
"Unidentified hairs
found on the victim."

06:15.440 --> 06:17.135
Mrs. Grant, Lexie.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.706
Now, a simple scan

06:18.740 --> 06:21.402
with an electron microscope
would have indicated

06:21.440 --> 06:23.408
that the scale
pattern was equme,

06:23.450 --> 06:26.578
not human, but did they
bother to look?

06:26.620 --> 06:27.678
No.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.846
GREEN:
Victims are, uh,

06:28.880 --> 06:30.086
Glen and Ianna Truman.

06:32.190 --> 06:36.627
He's some kind of ad exec,
she works for the Guggenheim.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.049
Equine. Horse hair.

06:39.090 --> 06:40.899
Exactly.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.192
WOMAN:
God, it's a tragedy.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.925
Yeah, I know the
Truman girls.

06:43.970 --> 06:44.959
Everyone loves them.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.889
I can't imagine how
they'll get through this.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.532
That's Annie.

06:49.570 --> 06:53.199
What about Talia Grant,
Lexie Grant's daughter

06:53.240 --> 06:55.105
You know her?
Let me see if
I can find her.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.072
I'm just wondering if maybe

06:56.110 --> 06:57.646
they shared the same instructor
or something.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.806
Oh, I'm not sure.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.442
Here we go.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.674
This is Talia Grant's class.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.609
No, her instructor
was Claudia Baker, but she

07:04.650 --> 07:06.208
left us over
two years ago.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.549
There's a Brenner
in both of these classes.

07:09.590 --> 07:10.750
Those are Eileen Brenner's kids.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.792
She's coming by here later today
with one of her daughters.

07:12.830 --> 07:13.990
Thanks.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.019
JAY:
So we're talking

07:15.060 --> 07:15.958
Eileen and Howard Brenner.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.161
Married 15 years.
They live up in Scarsdale.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.531
Turns out
they have two daughters.

07:19.570 --> 07:20.764
One who rode with Annie Truman,

07:20.800 --> 07:24.804
and the older daughter, who rode
with Talia Grant back in 2010.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.808
Okay, so they took
riding lessons together.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.229
Great. You got more?

07:29.280 --> 07:32.477
Don't I always, Al?
For starters, I got a series

07:32.520 --> 07:37.184
of cell phone calls in 2010 from
Donald Grant to Eileen Brenner.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.142
So? Their kids are
in the same class.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.851
They're making
carpool plans.

07:40.890 --> 07:42.585
Yeah, but how do you
explain calls

07:42.630 --> 07:43.528
from the two other
dead husbands,

07:43.560 --> 07:45.528
Truman and Reid,
to Mrs. Brenner, as well?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.097
And the fact that the number
they used to call her

07:48.130 --> 07:50.769
isn't the same one her own
husband used to call her.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.268
Now, that's some pretty secret
carpool plans.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.837
I don't know. They're all having
affairs with Eileen Brenner?

07:55.870 --> 07:57.030
I don't buy it.

07:57.070 --> 07:58.207
And by all accounts,

07:58.240 --> 07:59.502
these marriages were strong.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.576
Okay, go ahead.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.645
What?

08:02.680 --> 08:03.749
Ask me if I have more.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.747
Jay.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.077
Right.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.771
So, after I found those calls,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.788
I took all the data
you worked up

08:09.820 --> 08:12.288
from the first two homicides.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.550
Cell phone records,
bank statements, duplicated

08:14.590 --> 08:16.683
with Brenners and
our last Victims, the Trumans.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.288
Lot of data.
Which is why

08:18.330 --> 08:22.767
I ran it through an NSA data
mining search engine, and...

08:22.800 --> 08:24.859
found... that.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.128
What is that?

08:26.170 --> 08:27.728
Those empty spaces represent

08:27.770 --> 08:28.930
three-hour time blocks

08:28.970 --> 08:30.198
of no cell phone use.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.003
Which means none of the
husbands made any calls,

08:32.040 --> 08:34.929
used any cards or checked
any e-mail accounts within those

08:34.980 --> 08:36.129
three hours.

08:36.180 --> 08:37.875
Wait a second.
I know those dates.

08:37.910 --> 08:40.049
August 8, August 17.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.310
The Reid and Grant murders.

08:42.350 --> 08:45.319
Exactly. Those couples
were killed within 12 hours

08:45.350 --> 08:46.886
of the husband going dark.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.785
Same goes true for Glen Truman

08:48.820 --> 08:49.855
and his wife
Ianna yesterday.

08:49.890 --> 08:50.822
So, the question is,

08:50.860 --> 08:52.828
what were they doing
in those three hours?

08:52.860 --> 08:54.555
I might have
an answer.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.194
Turns out our E_ileen Brenner
wasn't always Eileen Brenner.

08:59.170 --> 09:01.035
Meet the former
Eileen Hanson.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.867
Complete
with a criminal history.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.901
A prostitution charge.
MURRAY:
Oh, several.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.771
Out of Florida
17 years ago.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.607
After graduating college,

09:08.640 --> 09:10.176
she and a couple
sorority sisters apparently

09:10.210 --> 09:11.973
started a little
call girl ring.

09:12.010 --> 09:16.174
Our squeaky clean Scarsdale
soccer mom was once a hooker.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.939
Prostitution. Three hours
sounds about right.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.991
Eileen Brenner?

09:29.030 --> 09:30.292
That's right.

09:30.330 --> 09:32.833
NYPD. Like to ask you
a few questions

09:32.870 --> 09:34.167
about Donald Grant.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.929
I'm sorry. Who?

09:35.970 --> 09:37.005
Donald Grant.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.168
Um, that name isn't familiar.

09:40.210 --> 09:43.270
What about Harvey Reid
or Glen Truman?

09:43.310 --> 09:45.005
I'm sorry.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.938
Beth, I'll be in, in a minute.

09:46.980 --> 09:48.311
I'm not talking to you.

09:48.350 --> 09:49.908
CARRIE:
Eileen,

09:49.950 --> 09:52.009
do you own an apartment
on East 20th Street?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.018
I may.

09:55.390 --> 09:57.950
Well, ifI was paying
$6,300 a month

09:57.990 --> 10:01.858
and running an escort service
out of it, I think I'd know.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.026
Mom, is everything okay?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.219
Yeah.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.067
Go on ahead. It's fine.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.228
Look, Eileen,
we're not here to judge you.

10:09.270 --> 10:11.738
I-I don't care
how you make your money.

10:11.770 --> 10:14.034
But you are the only thing
that connects us

10:14.080 --> 10:16.799
_ to six victims_ _
in a multiple homICIde.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.147
Wait. Homicide?

10:18.180 --> 10:20.068
Yes. So, if you know
anything at all,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.417
right now is the time to talk.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.247
I don't know anything
about anybody being killed.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.348
AL:
We're going to need

10:24.390 --> 10:26.984
the phone numbers and identities
of all your workers.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.159
I can't give you
that information.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.220
Eileen, did you hear
what I just said?

10:32.260 --> 10:36.026
I'm sorry. I can't give you
their names...

10:36.060 --> 10:37.994
because I don't know them.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.270
What do you mean, she doesn't
know who works for her?

10:50.310 --> 10:52.744
That's how she runs it. She only
know her girls by aliases

10:52.780 --> 10:53.849
and their disposable
cell phone numbers.

10:53.880 --> 10:57.247
Okay, so all the husbands
used the same escort service

10:57.290 --> 10:58.188
and the same apartment.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.051
That doesn't mean
it's the same killer.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.114
Which leaves you...

11:01.160 --> 11:02.411
39 hours.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.189
Oh, by the way,

11:04.230 --> 11:07.449
I assume that you tipped off
Vice to the arrest?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.320
What arrest?
Okay...

11:10.800 --> 11:12.267
I hesitate to ask this,

11:12.300 --> 11:14.768
but how exactly did you
leave things with Mrs. Brenner?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.290
We told her to keep doing
what she's been doing.

11:16.340 --> 11:17.261
In fact, we insisted.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.368
Oh, good. You insisted

11:18.410 --> 11:20.332
that she continue to operate
a criminal enterprise.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.200
_We're not interested
in a prostitution bust.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.343
We're trying to find a killer,

11:23.380 --> 11:25.041
who's probably
about to kill again,

11:25.080 --> 11:27.310
_ and Eileen Brenner's service
is the only thing that connects

11:27.350 --> 11:29.238
all our victims.
Great.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.249
So now Major Crimes is
in business with prostitutes.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.882
That a problem?

11:36.460 --> 11:38.428
So Brenner only
knows her girls

11:38.460 --> 11:39.529
through their
cell phones, right?

11:39.560 --> 11:41.892
Yeah, and they were all
burner cells, so dead end.

11:41.930 --> 11:44.819
Maybe not. I tracked down the
serial numbers on the phones,

11:44.870 --> 11:46.326
and check this out.

11:46.370 --> 11:48.463
Most of the phones
were purchased

11:48.500 --> 11:51.367
at a campus bookstore
at Hudson University.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.105
A college? Oh, come on.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.334
She's recruiting students?

11:54.380 --> 11:55.870
Maybe.

11:55.910 --> 11:59.038
Me and Murray are gonna head
over there right now.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.513
MAN:
Yeah, sure.
Uh, prepaid disposables

12:00.550 --> 12:03.314
are popular, what with,
you know, two-year plans--

12:03.350 --> 12:05.841
you get locked in,
they're super expensive.

12:05.890 --> 12:08.381
And, uh, the kids love
the whole privacy element.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.183
Well, it would be
very helpful

12:10.230 --> 12:13.028
if we could take a look
at your past sales records.

12:13.060 --> 12:14.493
Sure, um, I mean,
I'd need to see

12:14.530 --> 12:16.293
if we can generate
those kinds of receipts.

12:16.330 --> 12:17.262
We can get you
the phone

12:17.300 --> 12:19.120
ID. numbers if that'll
help you find them.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.195
So, now, you looking for phones

12:21.240 --> 12:23.128
or, uh, the folks
who bought 'em?

12:24.540 --> 12:27.338
We'd like to know who bought
these specific phones, yeah.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.870
See, now,
that I don't know about.

12:28.910 --> 12:29.877
That might be a little tougher.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.878
Harvey, this is a pretty
important investigation.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.275
No, right, yeah, you said, um...

12:33.320 --> 12:35.049
"Major Squad" or whatever.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.149
It's just
that I'm not so sure

12:36.180 --> 12:37.442
what I'm allowed to do,

12:37.490 --> 12:38.809
and I really feel like I should

12:38.850 --> 12:40.056
give the dean's office a call.

12:40.090 --> 12:41.079
Huh.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.128
Go ahead.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.559
Yeah, sure. I'll call.
Go for it.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.148
You'll have to excuse Harvey.

12:46.190 --> 12:48.158
The bookstore's sort of
his domain.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.168
He actually attended Hudson,

12:50.200 --> 12:52.168
uh, dropped out sophomore year,

12:52.200 --> 12:53.895
and he's been
at that bookstore ever since.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.191
I get it.
My cousin Chrissy,

12:55.240 --> 12:57.037
she's been a junior
over at Bennington

12:57.070 --> 12:58.367
for five years now, so...

12:59.510 --> 13:02.331
Uh, Detectives,
uh, if what you suspect

13:02.380 --> 13:05.076
regarding these cell phones
is true,

13:05.110 --> 13:07.817
it would obviously
be quite disturbing to us.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.078
Well, Dean Proctor,
we're not suggesting

13:09.120 --> 13:10.849
the university was aware
of this activity.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.983
The truth is, we were aware.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.112
Excuse me?

13:14.160 --> 13:17.379
About five years ago,
a couple parents raised concerns

13:17.430 --> 13:20.854
about certain income that their
children couldn't account for.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.460
And we conducted
an internal investigation

13:23.500 --> 13:26.389
and found that several
of our students were engaged

13:26.430 --> 13:28.295
in this sort of... activity.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.365
The-the students that
were involved were asked

13:30.410 --> 13:32.435
to withdraw,
which they did immediately

13:32.470 --> 13:34.006
when faced
with our evidence.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.337
Sir, we're gonna

13:35.380 --> 13:37.348
need access to your records.

13:37.380 --> 13:38.472
There are no records.

13:38.510 --> 13:40.239
Um, after
we were

13:40.280 --> 13:42.373
convinced that the activity
had ceased,

13:42.420 --> 13:44.047
we destroyed all records

13:44.090 --> 13:45.011
of our investigation.

13:45.050 --> 13:47.280
You destroyed records
of criminal activity

13:47.320 --> 13:49.459
to spare the school
some embarrassment?

13:49.490 --> 13:52.857
It wasn't only the school
that was spared embarrassment.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.027
Our investigation uncovered
the identity

13:55.060 --> 13:57.028
of many of these girls' clients.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.265
I assure you, if you
had seen that list,

13:59.300 --> 14:02.394
you would've appreciated
our discretion.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.566
People are
being killed,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.202
Dean Proctor.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.368
If you or your university
has obstructed our investigation

14:08.410 --> 14:12.301
in any way, your endowment will
be the least of your concerns.

14:18.350 --> 14:22.309
CARRIE:
Have you ever seen any
of these men going in or out

14:22.360 --> 14:23.918
of Eileen Brenner's
apartment?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.257
I don't know.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.349
There's some medical offices
on the first floor,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.391
the psychologist
and a podiatrist.

14:29.430 --> 14:31.261
So there's a lot
of foot traffic.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.063
No pun intended.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.193
You got a hard drive for these?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.663
DVR's been out a while.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.338
Don't want to record
any faces, huh?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.940
Hey, I just work the door.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.971
Sure you do.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.149
I got two in the front.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.408
Should take in
the whole sitting area.

14:49.450 --> 14:50.314
And one back here.

14:50.350 --> 14:52.341
I could rig up a special
just for the bed.

14:52.390 --> 14:53.379
No, that's okay.

14:53.420 --> 14:56.059
We just want to ID.
the clients and the girls.

14:56.090 --> 14:58.058
We don't need the whole show.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.919
This is all just... sad.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.268
CARRIE:
What, you mean rich married guys
sleeping with girls

15:06.300 --> 15:07.392
young enough
to be their daughters?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.431
Yeah, and then the rich

15:09.470 --> 15:11.563
married guys get killed.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.475
You know, it seems like...
whoever's doing this

15:13.510 --> 15:16.536
is making a point
about these men.

15:16.580 --> 15:19.549
But why kill the wives?

15:19.580 --> 15:22.413
All right, what if
it's not the men?

15:22.450 --> 15:24.441
What-what if
it's the marriages?

15:24.490 --> 15:28.483
All of these couples,
they seem... perfect.
Mmm.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.454
The money,
public displays of romance.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.287
Storybook relationships.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.150
Every one a lie.
Every one a lie.

15:34.200 --> 15:38.489
What if our killer
is punishing the hypocrites?

15:38.530 --> 15:41.465
Husband and wife.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.694
Mmm.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.465
Hey.
_Survei|lance c_amera
picked up our first one.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.330
Already?
She should be in class.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.472
Use your head, girl.

15:49.510 --> 15:50.647
Showtime.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.079
Am I alone
in feeling

15:52.110 --> 15:53.611
like I don't want to watch this?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.339
What, you mean
rich married guys

15:58.390 --> 15:59.687
sleeping with girls
young enough

15:59.720 --> 16:01.449
to be their daughters?

16:01.490 --> 16:04.357
Yeah, and then the rich
married guys get killed.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.534
That clock.

16:17.570 --> 16:18.639
Wait a second.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.503
When we _were there this
morning, it was accurate.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.508
Now it's says 3:34.
What time is it, Jay?

16:23.550 --> 16:26.303
It's, uh, 2:34.
It's an hour off.

16:26.350 --> 16:27.374
It's an hour off.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.741
So someone went in _
after we left and changed it.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.418
But why?

16:31.450 --> 16:33.452
Let's find out who it was.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.082
You put a camera in the clock.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.758
Okay, but I didn't kill anybody.

16:36.790 --> 16:39.679
Not only do you record
these girls and their johns,

16:39.730 --> 16:42.096
you stupidly record
the time and date.

16:42.130 --> 16:44.598
We found these in
your apartment.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.564
"September 15, 5:45 pm."

16:46.600 --> 16:49.296
Glen Truman.
September 15.

16:49.340 --> 16:50.637
You were working that day.

16:50.670 --> 16:53.104
You saw him come in,
you saw him go out.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.779
You followed him home, and you
murdered him and his wife.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.108
No! No, I swear to you, no!

16:58.150 --> 17:00.516
All three men were in the
building when you were working.

17:00.550 --> 17:03.110
All three couples were murdered
when you weren't.

17:03.150 --> 17:04.515
Am I missing something here?

17:04.550 --> 17:07.053
I'm telling you, all I did
was set up the nanny cam

17:07.090 --> 17:08.489
in the clock.
I didn't kill anyone!

17:08.520 --> 17:09.817
I swear!

17:09.860 --> 17:12.454
I'm just a perv.

17:19.170 --> 17:22.139
Jay, you get anything
off the videos?

17:22.170 --> 17:25.469
I think our doorman
shouldn't quit his day job.

17:25.510 --> 17:26.761
His s_hot selection
is awful,

17:26.810 --> 17:28.539
and with the films
taken together--

17:28.580 --> 17:29.729
forget it--
this man displays

17:29.780 --> 17:31.543
a certain narrative monotony,
you know what I'm saying?

17:31.580 --> 17:33.070
All right, you think
he's our guy or not?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.439
I doubt it.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.710
His alibi for the Truman
killings checks out.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.547
He did record all
three of our victims

17:38.590 --> 17:40.148
but each with a
different woman.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.782
I sent the pictures
of the girls to that dean

17:41.820 --> 17:44.527
over at Hudson University
to see if he can help I.D. them.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.527
All right,
so the question is,

17:45.560 --> 17:47.596
if the link isn't one escort,

17:47.630 --> 17:49.598
does anything tie
these victims together

17:49.630 --> 17:51.393
other than their profiles?

17:51.430 --> 17:53.591
Well, our killer chooses
his victims, right?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.767
So if it's not the doorman,
where does he see 'em?

17:55.800 --> 17:59.167
You know, usually
these high-end operations,

17:59.210 --> 18:01.474
the girls like to check out
the johns first.

18:01.510 --> 18:03.603
Some public place,

18:03.650 --> 18:05.777
restaurant, nightclub.

18:05.810 --> 18:07.710
Only problem is,
because of the number system,

18:07.750 --> 18:09.615
we can't ask Brenner.
She wouldn't know.

18:09.650 --> 18:12.483
Yeah. It's not
like we can ask the victims.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.819
You know what? Maybe there is
someone we can ask.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.555
With what Brenner charges
these guys, you figure

18:17.590 --> 18:19.421
they got to be
heavy hitters, right?

18:19.460 --> 18:20.529
Mm-hmm.
I think I even

18:20.560 --> 18:22.323
recognize a couple of them.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.590
If we can get 'em to talk to us,

18:24.630 --> 18:26.120
maybe we're in business.

18:33.510 --> 18:35.307
They don't have to talk to us.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.748
You look good, Eliot.
You lose some weight?

18:39.780 --> 18:42.146
Uh, no, actually, I have
put on a few pounds.

18:42.180 --> 18:44.648
Stress eating.
Ah.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.612
Don't I know it.
So...

18:46.650 --> 18:48.686
how's the new gig
treating you? Uh...

18:48.720 --> 18:52.224
seems like you're getting a lot
of nice press out of it.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.557
It's going well. Thanks.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.455
And, uh, yes,
we do get the press.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.389
Listen, I'm sorry
to cut to the chase,

18:59.430 --> 19:01.193
but I have a meeting later.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.629
Exploratory committee.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.703
2017.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.776
On the Q.T.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.710
Q.T.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.913
Of course, I am accepting
support of all kinds.

19:16.950 --> 19:19.384
Uh, it's funny.

19:19.420 --> 19:22.548
I have something that I need
to speak with you about

19:22.590 --> 19:25.684
on the... Q.T. also.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.698
And what's that?

19:27.730 --> 19:30.722
Does the name Eileen Brenner

19:30.770 --> 19:32.658
mean anything to you?

19:32.700 --> 19:34.668
Well, I meet a lot of people.

19:34.700 --> 19:36.236
Should it?

19:36.270 --> 19:37.931
She is a madam.

19:37.970 --> 19:42.873
And you are a fairly reliable
customer of hers, so...

19:42.910 --> 19:45.799
yeah, it should.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.875
No idea
what you're talking about.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.789
I-I didn't want to do this,
Stanton.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.599
You trying
to shake me down, Eliot?

20:04.630 --> 20:07.337
God, no. No.

20:07.370 --> 20:10.669
Although,
now that you mention it,

20:10.710 --> 20:14.737
should these aspirations of
yours come to fruition, I'm...

20:14.780 --> 20:17.749
I'm sure I'll think
of something.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.512
Fine.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.741
What do you want?

20:28.860 --> 20:32.352
The bar's called the Windover,
between Lex and Park on 57th.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.995
According to Stanton, all the
first meets take place there.

20:35.030 --> 20:37.328
I'm telling you, this guy
hasn't been this speechless

20:37.370 --> 20:38.564
since the Dinkins
administration.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.535
He'll do anything for us-- he'll
set up meets, give us names--

20:41.570 --> 20:43.538
as long as we keep
his name out of it.

20:43.570 --> 20:44.730
We don't need him.

20:44.770 --> 20:45.998
He was practically begging
to wear a wire.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.678
What do you mean,
we don't need him?

20:47.710 --> 20:49.473
He doesn't fit the profile
of our victims.

20:49.510 --> 20:50.670
Stanton Ward is divorced.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.803
Our guy's not
going to target him.

20:52.850 --> 20:54.647
Burns, believe me,
this guy will be of help us.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.647
Oh, he's already helped us.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.545
We know where the girls
make their first meet.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.410
What's the plan?
We just sit and wait

20:59.450 --> 21:00.883
for the perfect married john
to show up,

21:00.920 --> 21:02.285
which could be God knows when.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.719
CARRIE:
No, we don't
have to wait.

21:05.530 --> 21:06.724
No, see, I hate it
when you do this.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.694
Do what?
You know.

21:08.730 --> 21:11.290
Have Burns soften me up
with a jab, then you come in

21:11.330 --> 21:12.820
at the perfect moment
with the left hook.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.758
I prefer to think of it
as an uppercut.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.507
Listen, Eliot, I think whoever
we're after is a person

21:17.540 --> 21:19.963
who grew up in a world that
was perfect on the outside

21:20.010 --> 21:21.739
but rotten on the inside.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.407
By killing these
married couples,

21:23.450 --> 21:26.578
this person, in their mind,
is killing their own parents,

21:26.610 --> 21:28.771
the ones who made them suffer
behind closed doors

21:28.820 --> 21:30.515
by denying the lies
in their own marriage.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.438
This person
is targeting

21:32.490 --> 21:34.856
perfect couples, ones who seem
too good to be real

21:34.890 --> 21:36.778
because they aren't real.

21:38.530 --> 21:39.883
All right,
I'll buy your profile.

21:39.930 --> 21:41.921
But where do we find
such a couple?

21:41.960 --> 21:43.393
AI, will you marry me?

21:43.430 --> 21:46.490
Thought you'd
never ask.
Ah.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.839
MAN: _
What can I get you, Sir?

21:52.870 --> 21:54.007
I'll have your best
Irish whiskey, neat.

21:54.040 --> 21:57.077
CARRIE:
You could order a martini
or something, Al.

21:57.110 --> 21:58.975
Irish whiskey
is a little cop bar,

21:59.010 --> 22:00.079
don't you think?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.771
I like to taste my whiskey.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.741
How do I look?

22:02.780 --> 22:05.089
Uh, suit's a
little tight.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.542
CARRIE:
Well,

22:06.590 --> 22:07.989
that's 'cause it fits.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.352
CARRIE:
Wow, that was quick.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.526
Hey.

22:14.560 --> 22:15.891
Hey yourself.

22:16.930 --> 22:18.864
That whiskey?

22:18.900 --> 22:20.868
Irish. Can I get you one?

22:20.900 --> 22:23.562
Only cops drink Irish.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.532
CARRIE:
I told you.

22:25.570 --> 22:27.470
You're not a cop, are you?

22:27.510 --> 22:29.375
Scotland Yard, retired.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.871
Nah, I wish.

22:32.910 --> 22:35.970
I play around a little
with hedge funds.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.818
I never know what
that actually means.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.751
Well, it means I'm
a little boring...

22:41.790 --> 22:44.679
I have time to kill

22:44.730 --> 22:47.597
and... maybe some cash to burn.

22:47.630 --> 22:50.724
YOU want to burn some on me?

22:50.770 --> 22:53.466
I'm old enough
to be your father.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.139
So?

22:56.170 --> 22:58.536
I feel old.

22:58.570 --> 23:00.037
You know?

23:00.070 --> 23:01.606
Mmm.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.840
Yeah. Maybe.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.768
You're nice.

23:11.990 --> 23:14.879
Just go online
and pick a time.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.922
"Lauren."

23:17.960 --> 23:19.928
I'm Al.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.497
How did I do?

23:28.540 --> 23:30.667
Fine. But, you know,

23:30.710 --> 23:32.507
you could stop smiling.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.428
Who's smiling?

23:34.480 --> 23:35.902
I'm working.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.476
Mmm.

23:48.220 --> 23:51.018
* Let's fall in love

23:51.060 --> 23:53.858
* Why shouldn't we
fall in love? *

23:57.800 --> 23:59.893
* Let's fall in love.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.789
Wow.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.934
Wow. I've always wanted
to live in a brownstone.

24:05.970 --> 24:07.574
And now you do.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.805
And now I do.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.671
Look at this.
Mm-hmm.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.917
Careful.
Our fancy new

24:14.950 --> 24:17.510
neighbors will see.
That's the idea.

24:17.550 --> 24:19.609
You know,

24:19.650 --> 24:21.914
this whole marriage
thing isn't so bad.

24:21.960 --> 24:22.984
Hmm.

24:24.260 --> 24:26.956
JAY: Okay, guys, we are...
up and running.

24:26.990 --> 24:29.857
I'm sorry, am I interrupting
something here, guys?

24:29.900 --> 24:31.788
No, we're just practicing

24:31.830 --> 24:33.127
our overt displays of affection.

24:33.170 --> 24:35.058
Yeah, Al's really getting
into the role-playing.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.738
He's a total exhibitionist.
Me?

24:36.770 --> 24:38.032
CARRIE:
Yeah, you.

24:38.070 --> 24:41.073
December 24, 1999,
Madison Suites,

24:41.110 --> 24:43.271
room 108-- there was
that big window...
Jay,

24:43.310 --> 24:45.278
Okay, guys...
don't ever
get married.

24:45.310 --> 24:46.777
Don't do it.

24:46.810 --> 24:48.516
Speaking of exhibitionists,
Aw...

24:48.550 --> 24:51.144
uh, we kind of got you
on a bunch of screens over here.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.579
So, here's how it lays out.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.918
I got surveillance cams
all throughout the brownstone.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.985
Two in this room, one in
the bedroom, one in the kitchen.

24:58.030 --> 24:58.985
Now, they're
all Bluetooth-enabled,

24:59.030 --> 25:00.952
so you can turn them on and off
with the remotes

25:01.000 --> 25:02.922
you see around you.
Oh, look at that.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.689
We're gonna have
constant visual contact

25:04.730 --> 25:05.924
from Major Crimes.

25:05.970 --> 25:06.868
CARRIE:
Perfect little

25:06.900 --> 25:08.834
love nest for the
perfect little couple.

25:08.870 --> 25:10.064
Perfect little trap.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.307
Mmm. Well, now we're
just gonna have to show

25:12.340 --> 25:14.274
our perfect little selves
off to the world.

25:14.310 --> 25:16.232
Oh, that shouldn't be
an issue for you.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.305
Oh, don't start with me.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.908
Remember, I said

25:19.950 --> 25:22.612
_ "constant"_
Visual contact, right?

25:22.650 --> 25:23.981
We're working here.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.214
We're working here.

25:26.950 --> 25:28.019
*

25:28.060 --> 25:30.722
* Our day will come

25:32.760 --> 25:34.557
* And we'll have

25:34.600 --> 25:36.989
* Everything

25:38.670 --> 25:41.138
* We'll share the joy...

25:43.970 --> 25:45.267
You can't be serious.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.732
Oh, I'm serious.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.874
Really?
I am seriously
in love with you.

25:48.910 --> 25:51.003
Oh...

25:51.050 --> 25:54.019
Oh, wow.
Well, that is a lot...

25:54.050 --> 25:56.041
of diamonds, honey.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.616
147, actually.

25:57.650 --> 26:00.244
Circular, pear and marquise-cut
diamond clusters,

26:00.290 --> 26:01.882
internally flawless.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.353
Oh...
Hmm. Have you got any

26:03.390 --> 26:05.028
that are externally
flawless?

26:05.060 --> 26:06.049
Well, sir, I...

26:06.090 --> 26:07.955
To match her?
Oh...

26:09.700 --> 26:12.191
...brother! Uh...

26:12.230 --> 26:14.289
AL:
That looks beautiful,
doesn't it?

26:14.340 --> 26:15.762
Oh.

26:15.800 --> 26:19.167
I'm in love with you.
Mmm, say it again.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.075
He's gonna...

26:21.110 --> 26:22.702
I'm in love with you.

26:22.740 --> 26:23.946
We'll take it.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.675
JEWELER:
Very good, sir.

26:27.110 --> 26:30.170
Well, sweetheart,
what a wonderful day.

26:30.220 --> 26:31.710
Magical.
Mm-hmm.

26:31.750 --> 26:32.910
Mm-hmm.

26:32.950 --> 26:34.986
Oh, hell. I'm late
for my manager's meeting

26:35.020 --> 26:36.317
at Gramercy Park.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.952
Oh, you have to go?

26:37.990 --> 26:40.151
All right.

26:40.190 --> 26:42.192
Today really was fun.

26:42.230 --> 26:43.959
It really was.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.389
Be careful.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.966
Nothing's going
to happen till later,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.092
and by then, I'll be home.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.831
Home?

26:54.710 --> 26:57.031
You know, you should probably...

26:57.080 --> 26:59.969
kiss me good-bye
in case anyone's watching.

27:00.010 --> 27:02.046
You're probably right.

27:13.390 --> 27:15.392
*

27:18.400 --> 27:20.391
I love you.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.670
LAUREN:
It's open.

27:32.410 --> 27:35.117
Well, hello.
Hey.

27:35.150 --> 27:36.071
I remembered.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.088
Oh, uh, thanks,
but, uh...

27:38.120 --> 27:39.747
no, thanks.
No?

27:39.790 --> 27:41.758
I don't drink on the job.
Everything all right?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.678
Yeah. It's, um...

27:43.730 --> 27:45.982
No, it's-it's not. Listen.

27:46.030 --> 27:48.021
Jay. Jay, do you read?

27:48.060 --> 27:49.823
Loud and clear, boss.

27:49.860 --> 27:50.861
LAUREN:
What's going on?

27:50.900 --> 27:52.162
AL:
You got a visual on Carrie?

27:52.200 --> 27:53.167
JAY:
Indeed I do.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.292
LAUREN:
Oh, my God.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.069
Oh, I don't

27:56.100 --> 27:57.965
believe this!
It's okay. It's all right.
It's all right.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.966
Just sit down.

28:00.010 --> 28:01.375
We got to talk.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.340
How much longer do I
have to sit here?

28:10.380 --> 28:12.018
I don't know.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.848
How long do these things
usually last?

28:14.890 --> 28:16.016
Honestly?

28:16.060 --> 28:18.449
About ten minutes.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.754
The rest is
all chitchat.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.360
Listening to them
drone on and on

28:23.400 --> 28:25.368
about their jobs

28:25.400 --> 28:27.095
and their stupid,
stupid lives.

28:27.130 --> 28:30.099
You know, no one's
forcing you to do this.

28:30.140 --> 28:32.131
I take six classes
a semester.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.377
My time is precious--
I'm not trading it

28:34.410 --> 28:36.207
for minimum wage
and tips.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.379
Fine. I hear you.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.378
It just seems like...

28:40.410 --> 28:41.946
such a waste.

28:41.980 --> 28:45.108
You have any idea how
much law school costs?

28:45.150 --> 28:47.209
You're gonna be a lawyer?

28:48.260 --> 28:50.148
Why is that funny?

28:50.190 --> 28:52.158
You know what?

28:52.190 --> 28:54.158
Totally makes sense.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.155
Thank you.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.895
Mm-hmm.

29:00.270 --> 29:03.137
This guy...

29:03.170 --> 29:05.309
kills their wives, too?

29:05.340 --> 29:07.501
We think.

29:07.540 --> 29:11.203
He sees the wives _as...
partners in the lie.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.241
Their husband's lie.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.241
You have a partner?

29:18.290 --> 29:19.939
Yeah.

29:20.990 --> 29:23.185
I'm... working with her
right now.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.152
She's posing as your wife?

29:26.190 --> 29:27.259
Mm-hmm.

29:27.290 --> 29:29.099
Wow.

29:29.130 --> 29:30.927
What's she like?

29:32.600 --> 29:35.262
She's good at her job.

29:35.300 --> 29:37.188
I mean...

29:37.240 --> 29:40.038
she's brilliant at her job.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.528
In general, she's pretty...

29:43.580 --> 29:46.048
she's pretty brilliant.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.883
Huh.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.547
What?

29:52.590 --> 29:55.058
Now, that's funny.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.216
What?

29:56.260 --> 29:58.581
The guys I see, they...

29:58.630 --> 30:00.825
they probably had
their wedding announcements

30:00.860 --> 30:02.157
in the Times.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.122
They show up in
the Style section,

30:04.170 --> 30:07.526
at all these events,
wives on their arms...

30:07.570 --> 30:09.834
and yet they're here with me.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.170
And I never hear even a whisper

30:14.210 --> 30:16.428
of what I just heard
in your voice.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.176
What'd you hear?

30:23.080 --> 30:24.911
You know.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.508
*

30:33.260 --> 30:35.251
Hey, Jay.
I read you, Carrie.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.498
How is Al doing?

30:38.530 --> 30:40.191
Any news?

30:40.230 --> 30:42.130
He's just sitting there talking
to the girl-- I can patch you in

30:42.170 --> 30:43.262
if you want.
No. No, no,

30:43.300 --> 30:45.006
No, it's not a big deal.
not necessary.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.007
You know, they're just...

30:46.040 --> 30:47.974
No, I mean it, really, no.
What else you got?

30:48.010 --> 30:50.069
I think I may have I.D.'d
the undergrads

30:50.110 --> 30:51.304
who are part
of our escort operation.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.170
Wow. How

30:53.210 --> 30:54.609
Surveillance footage
from the college bookstore

30:54.650 --> 30:56.572
finally came in--
I isolated the girls

31:01.260 --> 31:02.887
Voil.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.524
Our prostitution ring.

31:06.530 --> 31:08.327
LAUREN:
Only cops drink Irish.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.248
You're not a cop, are you?

31:10.300 --> 31:11.995
Scotland Yard,
retired.

31:13.370 --> 31:14.962
The bookstore manager.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.558
That guy,
Harvey Reynolds, right?

31:16.600 --> 31:19.660
That guy... was watching
Al and Lauren at the Windover.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.268
He was there.

31:21.310 --> 31:22.299
You sure?

31:22.340 --> 31:23.978
Yes, I'm sure. Pick him up.

31:24.010 --> 31:25.045
Pick him up now.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.342
Copy that.

31:30.450 --> 31:34.056
JAY: Harvey Reynolds,
this is the NYPD.

31:34.090 --> 31:36.411
Mr. Reynolds,
please open the door.

31:40.060 --> 31:41.027
Clear.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.027
Clear.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.391
Nothing on this side.

31:43.430 --> 31:45.068
Hey, Jay, over here.

31:59.750 --> 32:00.648
Nah, stay put.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.272
CARRIE:
I'm not very good

32:02.320 --> 32:03.241
at staying put.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.646
How much of a head start
does he have on us?

32:05.690 --> 32:08.579
We don't know.
We got a BOLO out on his car,

32:08.620 --> 32:10.986
but if he's coming
for you, for me...

32:11.030 --> 32:12.327
No, that doesn't fit
the profile.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.123
He wants us both in this house.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.651
My point. Stay put.
We're gonna finish

32:16.700 --> 32:17.598
what we started.

32:17.630 --> 32:19.166
I'm not arguing.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.634
I'm just saying,
I'm not very good at it.

32:21.670 --> 32:25.231
Don't worry,
I'll be home soon.

32:25.270 --> 32:27.659
Oh, well, I'll have your pipe
and your slippers ready for you.

32:27.710 --> 32:30.531
I think married life suits you.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.002
Yeah. Bye.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.048
So, what happens
to me now?

32:38.090 --> 32:40.411
You take me in?

32:41.590 --> 32:43.558
You know what?

32:43.590 --> 32:45.558
Nothing happens.

32:45.590 --> 32:47.581
We made a deal
with your madam.

32:49.430 --> 32:51.660
Please don't patronize me.

32:51.700 --> 32:56.091
I know you feel old inside,
but you are anything

32:56.140 --> 32:57.391
but old.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.499
Save your justifications
for law school.

32:59.540 --> 33:02.532
You don't belong in this.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.777
And besides... you got luclq

33:05.810 --> 33:08.176
this time.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.245
Okay.

33:12.520 --> 33:15.614
What about you two?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.150
What about us?

33:17.190 --> 33:19.181
You gonna finish
what you started?

33:24.470 --> 33:26.495
Yeah, Jay.

33:26.530 --> 33:28.634
Hey, we found Harvey Reynolds.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.092
His body, anyway.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.437
You sure?

33:31.470 --> 33:34.633
Positive I.D. Gun, too.
Sig Sauer .40.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.035
Looks like
the kid offed himself.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.379
Way to go, guys.
And you only

33:48.420 --> 33:50.456
needed 45 hours.

33:50.490 --> 33:51.650
You owe me three hours.

33:51.690 --> 33:53.749
We didn't even have
to use your crazy plan.

33:53.790 --> 33:55.519
Who are you calling crazy?

33:55.560 --> 33:57.255
That's okay.
It doesn't matter.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.528
We had a nice day.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.094
Oh, yes, we did.

34:00.130 --> 34:02.598
Just tell me _
that you kept the receipts

34:02.640 --> 34:03.834
for all the things
in those bags?

34:03.870 --> 34:05.667
Did we need receipts?

34:05.710 --> 34:06.699
Did you get receipts?

34:06.740 --> 34:08.207
Rich people
don't need receipts.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.377
We didn't
get receipts.

34:09.410 --> 34:11.298
JAY:
So, boss, looks like

34:11.350 --> 34:12.703
it's open and shut
with Harvey Reynolds.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.547
Even down to the murders
in Columbus.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.741
Coincides with
a leave of absence he took

34:16.780 --> 34:18.543
from the university bookstore.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.239
We haven't finished our
analysis, but so far,

34:20.290 --> 34:22.212
he's a dead-on match
with the profile.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.478
Harvey was an orphan,
raised in a state facility,

34:24.530 --> 34:26.122
abusive manager
who skimmed funds

34:26.160 --> 34:27.821
to keep him and his wife
in luxury.

34:27.860 --> 34:30.397
He grew up hating and resenting
his parental figures.

34:30.430 --> 34:32.796
When he realized
how close we were, he panicked.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.491
Suicide was his way out.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.691
Well, finish packing up, people.
You have any idea

34:37.740 --> 34:40.402
how much that brownstone's
costing me by the hour?

34:40.440 --> 34:42.601
Sure, after dinner.

34:42.640 --> 34:43.732
Burns?

34:43.780 --> 34:46.271
I'm taking
my three hours.
Oh.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.675
Fine. Just don't break anything.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.711
I want my deposit back.

34:48.750 --> 34:51.389
Okay. Bye.

34:51.420 --> 34:52.387
Bye.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.183
So, what?

34:54.220 --> 34:55.414
You making me dinner?

34:55.460 --> 34:56.711
Ithought
I'd get take-out.
Oh.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.557
Japanese place on Green.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.558
Ah.
You happen

35:00.590 --> 35:01.727
to remember what we liked there?

35:01.760 --> 35:02.727
You're kidding me, right?

35:02.760 --> 35:03.727
No.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.762
Twice in two days?

35:05.800 --> 35:07.324
Okay, fine.

35:07.370 --> 35:08.394
Shinko.
River fish.
Shinko.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.169
Got you.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.736
And open a bottle of wine.

35:11.770 --> 35:13.203
All right.

35:14.410 --> 35:15.672
Bye.

35:18.610 --> 35:21.215
* Butter my bread

35:22.880 --> 35:26.680
* Sugar my lips
with strawberries... *

35:31.290 --> 35:33.758
I gave you a key.

35:33.790 --> 35:35.929
MAN:
Delivery.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.394
Um... hey.

35:38.430 --> 35:40.660
Mrs. Burns?
Yeah.

35:40.700 --> 35:43.260
Uh, these are, uh... these
are from your husband.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.801
From my husband?

35:44.840 --> 35:46.432
Yeah. Can Ijust
set 'em down?

35:46.470 --> 35:47.698
Uh...
Oh, sure. No.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.276
Kind of heavy.
Why don't you
just put 'em

35:49.310 --> 35:50.709
on_ that coffee table
right over there?
Oh, great.

35:50.740 --> 35:53.573
CARRIE:
It's totally fine.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.444
Your husband must love you
very much.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.608
My... husband, yes,
he does love me very much.

36:00.650 --> 36:01.719
Oh.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.149
Would you, uh... would
you mind, uh, signing that?

36:05.790 --> 36:08.293
CARRIE:
That is a lot of diamonds.

36:08.330 --> 36:09.422
JEWELER:
147, actually.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.861
Circular, pear and marquise-cut
diamond clusters...

36:13.900 --> 36:15.561
Sure.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.238
That's an interesting ring.

36:17.270 --> 36:18.862
Yeah, it's a...
a family heirloom.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.935
Oh.
It belonged
to my father.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.733
It's funny. I...

36:22.780 --> 36:26.602
I thought I saw someone wearing
the exact same ring at Versani.

36:26.650 --> 36:27.799
It's a jewelry store.

36:27.850 --> 36:30.512
I've never been there.

36:30.550 --> 36:32.313
My mistake.

36:32.350 --> 36:33.840
I'll sign this for you

36:33.890 --> 36:36.814
so you can, uh...
get going.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.737
Here...

36:54.380 --> 36:56.439
AL:
Okay, look.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.833
I don't know which river fish
is the one, okay?

36:57.880 --> 36:59.939
So, there are two of them.
I want to get both of those.

36:59.980 --> 37:02.574
Whatever you want,
you can have it. Only...

37:02.620 --> 37:04.247
It's not a robbery.

37:04.290 --> 37:07.339
Ijust... I hate this part,
but it's necessary, you know?

37:07.390 --> 37:09.483
So, you move.
My husband...

37:09.520 --> 37:10.919
You move!

37:10.960 --> 37:11.881
Right now.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.329
Okay, okay.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.391
What the hell?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.631
Hey, Carrie,
did you turn this thing back on?

37:23.670 --> 37:25.968
Hey, Murray?

37:26.010 --> 37:27.830
This thing came
back on by itself.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.007
I don't get it.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.678
Where are they?

37:30.710 --> 37:32.473
I don't know.

37:32.510 --> 37:34.319
Well, rewind it.

37:34.350 --> 37:35.612
Right. You know, with all
this stuff, I keep...

37:35.650 --> 37:36.844
You know what? Forget it.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.984
That's why we VCR people
are here to remind you.

37:41.990 --> 37:44.288
Oh, my God.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.286
That's the dean
from Hudson University.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.924
Just gonna check.
Want to make sure.

37:54.470 --> 37:55.937
Oh.

37:55.970 --> 37:57.961
Yeah?

37:59.870 --> 38:02.737
_Get a radio car over there
right now. I'm heading over.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.907
Yeah, send ESU.
Send everything you've got.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.008
What about the other cameras?

38:06.050 --> 38:06.903
The system's pretty primitive,

38:06.950 --> 38:08.941
but I think
I can override the cutoff.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.379
Meaning?
I can turn it back on.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.388
Got it.

38:17.990 --> 38:19.981
This is a
lovely place.

38:20.030 --> 38:21.554
Oh.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.592
You have an excellent eye,
you know that?

38:24.630 --> 38:26.666
Well, thank you.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.931
It, uh, takes one
to understand it.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.936
I grew up in a house like this.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.938
My father was a banker.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.971
He was a handsome man,

38:40.010 --> 38:41.944
just like
Mr. Burns.
Mmm.

38:41.980 --> 38:44.915
Ah, we really loved him.

38:44.950 --> 38:46.645
We?

38:46.690 --> 38:49.079
Mother and I.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.088
Oh.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.429
Please let me go.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.722
Okay, she's playing along.

38:54.760 --> 38:55.920
Yeah, that's smart.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.029
She doesn't want to
challenge his pathology.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.561
She's buying time.

38:58.600 --> 38:59.999
I can't, don't you see?

39:00.030 --> 39:02.760
He's been cheating on you,
Mother.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.131
With a hooker.

39:04.170 --> 39:06.035
Mother?

39:06.070 --> 39:08.061
No.

39:08.110 --> 39:10.135
Don't. Don't pretend.

39:10.180 --> 39:12.546
You knew, didn't you?

39:12.580 --> 39:15.117
When he touched you
at night, you knew.

39:15.150 --> 39:18.119
Yes. When you wore the clothes
that he bought you

39:18.150 --> 39:19.879
and you went to his parties.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.115
Admit it, you
always knew.
I-I didn't. I didn't.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.752
Don't lie to me!

39:23.790 --> 39:26.054
I did know.

39:26.090 --> 39:28.991
ButI loved him.

39:29.030 --> 39:31.521
We both did.

39:31.570 --> 39:34.630
That's what's so hard.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.062
We do. We love him.

39:37.100 --> 39:38.169
Yeah.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.804
I've watched you.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.138
You love him so much,
you would die for him.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.875
But don't worry.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.878
It's going to be all right.

39:45.910 --> 39:47.605
We're going to make him pay.

39:48.950 --> 39:50.042
AL:
Honey, I'm home!

39:50.080 --> 39:52.116
Shh.

39:52.150 --> 39:54.141
Say, "Hi."

39:54.190 --> 39:55.817
Just say, "Hi."

39:55.860 --> 39:57.816
Okay.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.782
Hey, honey.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.798
Hey, I picked up
some Indian food.

40:01.830 --> 40:03.058
Oh, yeah?

40:03.100 --> 40:04.624
Yeah, from Jay's.

40:04.670 --> 40:08.026
The Murray Curry.
I got a double order.

40:08.070 --> 40:11.460
You know what?
I hate Indian food!

40:11.510 --> 40:13.205
No, I thought
you liked it.
Well, how

40:13.240 --> 40:15.800
would you know what I like?
You're at the office all day.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.637
Be nice.
Why should I be

40:17.680 --> 40:19.147
nice to him?
You said it yourself.

40:19.180 --> 40:20.909
He's a lying cheat.

40:20.950 --> 40:23.475
I was just playing along
to protect you.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.148
No, no. You-you adore him.

40:26.190 --> 40:29.114
You're just a little boy.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.958
How could you understand?

40:31.990 --> 40:34.151
We weren't lying
to the world.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.852
We were lying
to protect you.
No.

40:36.900 --> 40:38.527
No. I saw you.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.463
I'm not your mother.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.632
And I'm not your father.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.542
Murray Curry, huh?

40:54.580 --> 40:56.218
I had to improvise.

40:56.250 --> 40:58.138
Okay.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.586
ELIOT:
But the best part is,

41:01.620 --> 41:04.555
I was expecting to get nailed
with expenses for all this.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.524
You know, the brownstone,
the wardrobe, whatever.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.893
But I just got a call from my
new best friend, Stanton Ward.

41:09.930 --> 41:12.490
As comptroller, he's got access
to discretionary funds,

41:12.530 --> 41:14.862
and he thought it best
if our little operation didn't

41:14.900 --> 41:17.061
"raise any red flags,"
is how he put it.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.102
Oh, the putz will probably
be mayor someday.

41:19.140 --> 41:21.062
Good job, Burns.

41:21.110 --> 41:24.602
Hey, Al, just got back
background on Proctor.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.003
Turns out he was
an only kid.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.540
One of Dad's
regular hookers turned out

41:27.580 --> 41:28.649
to be a federal agent.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.240
Dad was sent up the river,
Mom had a nervous breakdown,

41:31.280 --> 41:33.248
and poor little Adrian
ended up in foster care.

41:33.290 --> 41:34.609
And Harvey Reynolds?

41:34.660 --> 41:36.218
MURRAY:
Proctor killed him.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.251
Looks like they met
when Proctor was investigating

41:38.290 --> 41:41.088
the call girl scandal at Hudson
five years ago.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.724
I think he sensed
Harvey's own damage,

41:43.760 --> 41:46.729
figured he might find a future
use for him, which he did.

41:46.770 --> 41:47.998
Hey.

41:48.030 --> 41:49.839
Uh, hey, Carrie.

41:49.870 --> 41:52.134
Pretty slick move
turning on the camera.

41:52.170 --> 41:54.900
Well, you know me, Jay.
I'm slick.

41:54.940 --> 41:56.635
Although, I will say,
it's a little disturbing

41:56.680 --> 41:59.808
that you could have
watched us any time you wanted.

41:59.850 --> 42:02.273
Why

42:02.320 --> 42:05.312
Well, I'm a little embarrassed
to tell you, Jay.

42:05.350 --> 42:08.046
But you'd have
seen two people

42:08.090 --> 42:09.853
in an absolute frenzy,

42:09.890 --> 42:13.883
ravenously
devounng".

42:13.930 --> 42:15.158
raw fish.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.190
Whatever happened to my sushi?

42:19.230 --> 42:20.720
Oh, something came up.

42:20.770 --> 42:22.658
You still up for it?

42:22.700 --> 42:24.565
I'm always up for it.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.339
I do have
a question, though.

42:26.370 --> 42:30.204
_Two hours alone in a room_
With an undergraduate call girl.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.776
Three hours.

42:31.810 --> 42:33.607
Even better.
What happened?

42:34.850 --> 42:36.715
We talked.

42:36.750 --> 42:38.718
What, did you give her
life advice?
0.

42:38.750 --> 42:40.217
She gave me advice, actually.

42:40.250 --> 42:42.013
What kind of advice?

42:42.060 --> 42:44.722
The kind you don't ask for
but you get anyway.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.079
Fine.

42:46.130 --> 42:48.280
Are you planning
on taking her advice?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.968
You'll be the first to know.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.968
* While we are young

42:54.000 --> 42:56.195
* Let's fall in love

42:58.640 --> 43:00.301
* Let's fall in love

43:01.680 --> 43:03.671
* Let's fall in love

43:05.210 --> 43:06.905
* Let's fall in love.
