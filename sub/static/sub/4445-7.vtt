<i>- Previously on</i> the strain...
- You've grown old, a230385.

00:05.172 --> 00:08.607
- It has been many years,
you look exactly the same.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.643
- We're organizing you all
for assignments

00:11.645 --> 00:13.178
To porters and johns.
- Skills?

00:13.180 --> 00:15.481
- We are carpenters.
- This scourge

00:15.483 --> 00:17.216
We're now witnessing has existed

00:17.218 --> 00:19.118
<i>For millennia.</i>
<i>Ravages what is human</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:21.353
<i>And instills a raging thirst.</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:24.390
- This epidemic was intentional?
Somebody planned this?

00:24.392 --> 00:26.325
- I don't know! <i>They paid me</i>
<i>a little bit of money</i>

00:26.327 --> 00:28.560
<i>To do them a favor, then</i>
<i>the favors kept getting bigger.</i>

00:28.562 --> 00:31.330
- You waited now to tell us!
- You might not understand this,

00:31.332 --> 00:34.299
Eph, but I would do anything
to keep my wife alive.

00:36.169 --> 00:38.704
- No, gusto! Gusto! Help!

00:40.407 --> 00:44.376
- What is that shit?
Bro, get it out!

00:44.378 --> 00:46.845
- Those we hold dear,
if they are turned,

00:46.847 --> 00:49.248
<i>They come back home</i>
<i>and destroy those</i>

00:49.250 --> 00:51.583
<i>They love the most.</i>
<i>- Where are we going?</i>

00:51.585 --> 00:53.485
- Mama needs some rest,

00:53.487 --> 00:55.554
So we are going on an adventure.

00:55.556 --> 00:59.058
- You're both ready. Good.
I have a new plan.

01:22.949 --> 01:25.250
- (valet): Would you like me
to carry it for you, mr. Luss?

01:25.252 --> 01:27.886
- No. There should be
somebody here.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.122
I got it. Thanks.

01:33.393 --> 01:37.362

01:47.240 --> 01:49.274

Neeva.

[I reach you. 25 times I called
you before I get through.]

02:33.953 --> 02:36.989
You must come home.
Your wife isn't well.

[there's something

02:38.993 --> 02:42.027
[she doesn't even know it. I--]
- whoa! Just slow down. What?

02:42.029 --> 02:44.796
- I took the children.
- [took them where?]

02:44.798 --> 02:47.833
- My home.
- [on my way from the airport.]

02:47.835 --> 02:49.935
I'll be at the house
in 20 minutes.

02:49.937 --> 02:53.372
Just bring the kids back there.
- No, I cannot.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.008
- I've been on a plane

02:56.010 --> 02:58.143

02:58.145 --> 03:00.312

03:00.314 --> 03:03.115
- Fine. In the morning.

03:03.117 --> 03:06.652
First thing in the morning,
bring them to the house.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.952
(mr. Luss sighs.)

03:43.489 --> 03:45.557
- Neighborhood's

03:45.559 --> 03:48.427
Any idea what's going on?
- They say it's from eclipse.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.730
- How's that?
- $8.30.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.267

What the!?

04:29.235 --> 04:31.236
Go, go, go!
Just start the car!

04:31.238 --> 04:33.071
Go! Move! Drive!

04:33.073 --> 04:35.574
Lock the doors! Drive the car!

04:35.576 --> 04:36.808
- Drive the car!

04:36.810 --> 04:38.944
Jesus christ!

04:38.946 --> 04:40.579
Drive the car!
- What is this, man?!

04:40.581 --> 04:42.714
- Drive the goddamn car! Go!

04:42.716 --> 04:45.651
No, don't! Ah! Ah! Holy shit!

04:45.653 --> 04:48.153
- What is this, man?!
- Go! Go!

04:48.155 --> 04:50.155

Joan, you got to call the cops!

Joan, honey, where are you?

05:18.351 --> 05:19.685
Joan!

05:19.687 --> 05:22.854
Come on, come on.
Oh! Oh, thank god!

05:22.856 --> 05:24.923

05:40.440 --> 05:42.941
(theme music)

05:54.854 --> 05:57.122
- <i>Authorities just announced</i>
<i>the brooklyn bridge</i>

05:57.124 --> 05:59.124
<i>Has been closed...</i>
<i>- Silver bullets?</i>

05:59.126 --> 06:01.727
- They are susceptible
to silver, it burns them.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.563
I cast these bullets myself.
- Ok.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.965
- I learned the legend
of this creature

06:06.967 --> 06:09.401
From my <i>bubbeh,</i> my grandmother,
when I was 8 years old.

06:09.403 --> 06:12.204
She's the one who told me
silver could harm them.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.173
I have since
verified this many times.

06:15.175 --> 06:20.078
- Silver is known to interfere
with sulfur bonds in bacteria.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.748
- I suggest you fill up a gun.
- Look, before we do

06:22.750 --> 06:24.750
Any more killing, and especially
because I think it's clear

06:24.752 --> 06:27.819
We can't stop this thing one
by one, I've got a better idea.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.856
We've got video. We've got
ample proof to show people.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.658
Let's get this in front of the
public, in front of everybody.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.527
- That will not work.

06:35.529 --> 06:39.097
Whoever is behind this
has eliminated that option

06:39.099 --> 06:41.500
With much calculation
and to great expense.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.336
- Oh, but your theory that you
pitched yesterday, that we kill

06:44.338 --> 06:47.072
The leader of these vampires,
that's far more logical.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.208
- It's far more likely to work.
We kill the master,

06:50.210 --> 06:52.611
And its spawn will die.
I promise you.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.447
- Ok, for convenience sake
and strictly as a semantic term,

06:55.449 --> 06:57.516
We'll refer to him
as "the master".

06:57.518 --> 06:59.584
You're saying we kill the master
and that's somehow

06:59.586 --> 07:01.953
Gonna stop this plague.
- Yeah.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.022
- That makes
no biological sense!

07:04.024 --> 07:06.057
You destroy one creature,
and somehow

07:06.059 --> 07:08.059
All the other ones die?
How does that work?

07:08.061 --> 07:10.429
- I have verified the
observations of these authors

07:10.431 --> 07:13.231
With my own experience.
Those that are inaccurate,

07:13.233 --> 07:17.302
I have discarded. That is
your scientific method, no?

07:17.304 --> 07:20.472
If you wish to defeat this evil,
you must trust me.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.642
I understand this! You do not!

07:23.644 --> 07:25.977
- (man on tv): <i>Aliens have</i>
<i>infiltrated the highest levels</i>

07:25.979 --> 07:28.380
<i>Of our government--</i>
<i>- (woman):</i> <i>Thanks, howard.</i>

07:28.382 --> 07:30.248
- At every turn,
everything I have said

07:30.250 --> 07:32.150
Has proven to be correct.
Is that not true?

07:32.152 --> 07:34.653
- Yes, but--
- this is no different.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.888
Logic is not the issue here...

07:36.890 --> 07:39.124
It's your desire
to always be in control.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.893
- Alright, alright,
if we were to do this,

07:41.895 --> 07:44.062
How do we find this master?

07:44.064 --> 07:46.798
Well, that is our first problem.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.834
His nesting place
will be well hidden.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.069
We need to locate
his human helpers.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.138
- What about jim?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.240
Those people hired jim

07:55.242 --> 07:57.175
To smuggle the coffin
out of the airport.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.344
- Jim? Who's jim?
- He's the guy who betrayed me.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.147
I'm not going back there.
- We're running out

08:02.149 --> 08:05.851
Of other options.
- Please, ephrem,

08:05.853 --> 08:09.387
Trust me.

08:11.123 --> 08:14.493
We will prevail.

08:14.495 --> 08:17.229
(people talking in german)
(knocking)

08:52.498 --> 08:54.733
-  <i>Achtung!</i>

08:54.735 --> 08:57.369
In line! Now!

08:57.371 --> 08:59.304
(dog barking)

09:03.175 --> 09:05.076
(sighing)

09:05.078 --> 09:08.747
- Gentlemen...
While you have been

09:08.749 --> 09:12.250
Contributing so diligently
to the war effort,

09:12.252 --> 09:14.419
We conducted an inspection
of your barracks

09:14.421 --> 09:17.289
And made a surprising discovery.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.660
A jewish talisman.

09:23.195 --> 09:27.065
I believe you people
refer to it as

09:27.067 --> 09:30.268
The hand of miriam.

09:30.270 --> 09:34.706
We found it secured
beneath one of your bunks.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.509
It appears to have been carved

09:37.511 --> 09:39.945
From the very oak
you work with in this shop.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.181
Oak that is property
of the third reich.

09:47.019 --> 09:50.388
Now, who is responsible

09:50.390 --> 09:53.358
For this fine piece
of craftsmanship?

09:55.394 --> 09:58.163
No one wishes
to claim credit?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.667
Very well.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.847
(man speaking hebrew)

10:22.888 --> 10:24.756
I will shoot you one at a time

10:24.758 --> 10:28.393
Until the perpetrator
steps forward.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.867
- I made it.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.741
- Where did you learn
to carve like this?

10:42.743 --> 10:44.643
- My father.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.679
- Show me your hands.

10:54.453 --> 10:56.721
Yes.

11:02.628 --> 11:07.065
"a230385."

11:09.769 --> 11:13.204
Please... Come with me.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.540
<i>If I recall correctly,</i>

11:15.542 --> 11:19.044
This totem is named after
the sister of moses and aaron

11:19.046 --> 11:22.347
And is supposed
to offer protection from evil.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.583
(dog barking)

11:27.987 --> 11:30.889
I have a special project
for you.

11:41.233 --> 11:44.769
(man speaking german)

11:46.572 --> 11:48.907
Lots of detail work.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.209
That shouldn't be
difficult for you.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.345
You're excused
from regular duties.

11:54.347 --> 11:58.149
This will be your sole focus.

12:06.158 --> 12:08.026
- (policeman): <i>Any contraband</i>
<i>between your toes?</i>

12:08.028 --> 12:10.662
Let me see.
Wiggle 'em for me.

12:10.664 --> 12:13.098
- You know what I'm saying, bro?
- I'm not your bro.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.900
- It was self-defense!
- Other foot, please.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.902
Up! Toes.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.771
- You see that fat dude's body?

12:19.773 --> 12:22.340
- Do I look like a coroner
to you? Arms up.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.242
- He had a 6-foot frog tongue!

12:24.244 --> 12:27.912
He bled white!
He had worms in his blood!

12:27.914 --> 12:29.914
- Sir, you need to chill out.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.883
- Get the light
out of my face, man.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.885
- In a couple of hours,
you'll come down off

12:33.887 --> 12:35.854
Of whatever shit you took,
but in the meantime,

12:35.856 --> 12:37.756
You need to follow
my instructions.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.791
Now bend forward
and expose your buttocks.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.660
- I didn't take nothing.
I don't do drugs.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.030
You better tell your bosses
there's some weird shit

12:46.032 --> 12:48.933
Going down out there.
- This is new york city,

12:48.935 --> 12:52.003
Weird shit goes down
out there all the time.

12:59.912 --> 13:03.148
- What did I forget?
- Your phone charger.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.724
- Alright, well,
we better get going.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.726
- Our flight doesn't leave
for 4 hours.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.661
- Yeah, well,
with everything that's going on,

13:16.663 --> 13:18.997
Traffic is going to be
a nightmare.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.602
Something wrong?
- You tell me.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.805
You can't sit still.
You keep looking out the window.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.440
- Don't want to miss the flight.
- Why?

13:29.442 --> 13:31.810
You say this is
the most deadly outbreak ever

13:31.812 --> 13:34.979
And suddenly you want
to run off to palo alto with me?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.981
That's not you.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.850
- This is different.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.952
This is about your health.
It's about us.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.621
- I know when you're lying
to me, you always fiddle

13:43.623 --> 13:45.957
With your glasses.
- Could we just talk about this

13:45.959 --> 13:48.760
When we get there?
- No. We're talking now.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.662
Why did barnes sideline you?

13:50.664 --> 13:53.031
- He sidelined all of us.
He doesn't want to acknowledge

13:53.033 --> 13:55.700
What's going on.
- Eph--

13:55.702 --> 13:57.836
- No, it's...
- You helped him do whatever

13:57.838 --> 14:00.438
Got him into trouble.
- It's not eph's fault. It's me.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.473
- I don't understand.
- I know.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.910
(knocking on door)
- jim, it's eph!

14:13.352 --> 14:15.520
- I thought the fbi had you.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.255
- It did. Let us in.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.893
- Sylvia, please.
- Let them though.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.568
- What don't you understand?
Your husband accepted bribes

14:30.570 --> 14:32.637
And because of that,
an epidemic is now tearing

14:32.639 --> 14:35.373
Its way through the city.
- Sylvie...

14:35.375 --> 14:37.942
I was involved in a major way.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.313
Look--
- no, you're not actually

14:42.315 --> 14:45.717
Thinking of doing this.
(helicopter whirring)

14:50.756 --> 14:53.057
I cannot believe
that you are gonna let

14:53.059 --> 14:56.661
This self-righteous prick
manipulate you with crazy talk

14:56.663 --> 14:59.597
About vampires!
- No, I... I saw one.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.566
It attacked me.
- I'm not listening

15:01.568 --> 15:03.935
To any more of this.
You need to decide

15:03.937 --> 15:07.672
What you're going to do...
And who matters to you.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.476
- I have to help them.
(sylvia sighs.)

15:13.279 --> 15:15.546
- I will get him. Great.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.548
- Where are you going?

15:17.550 --> 15:19.784
- To call a cab. I'm leaving!

15:19.786 --> 15:22.053
You do what you want,
I will too!

15:22.055 --> 15:24.889
- Jim, I need you

15:24.891 --> 15:27.458
To describe the german.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.430
- He was about 45,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.732
Blond, hair graying,
maybe a toupee.

15:34.734 --> 15:38.369
Really waxy skin.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.773
And his eyes were intense.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.741
He was well dressed.

15:43.743 --> 15:47.445
- Thomas eichhorst.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.151
- Give me a minute.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.453
- Let him talk to her.

16:04.563 --> 16:08.333
- What's your history
with this german?

16:08.335 --> 16:11.636
- It's long... Complicated.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.339
He's a <i>strigoi.</i>

16:14.341 --> 16:17.175
When I first met him
many years ago,

16:17.177 --> 16:19.410
He was still human, yet...

16:21.180 --> 16:24.482
...Just as monstrous.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.321
- A230385.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.257
(muffled gunshots outside)
(dog barking)

16:33.259 --> 16:36.427
(artillery fire)
(unlocking door)

16:38.630 --> 16:40.498
How is it progressing?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.501
- Very well,
<i>herr standartenfuhrer.</i>

16:43.503 --> 16:45.636
(men talking in german)

16:45.638 --> 16:49.273
(dog barking)

16:53.045 --> 16:55.279
- Your father taught you well.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.022
Does it bring you enjoyment?

17:05.724 --> 17:08.860
- It takes my mind
off this place.

17:10.662 --> 17:14.165
In that sense I suppose, it's...

17:14.167 --> 17:16.868
Pleasurable.
(gunshots outside)

17:27.012 --> 17:29.380
- I've never been good
with my hands.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.984
Cannot draw or sculpt
or carve anything.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.588
Want to know
how pathetic I am?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.692
In middle-school woodworking,
I had to steal

17:41.694 --> 17:45.696
Another boy's project
to pass the class.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.899
How sad is that?

17:49.935 --> 17:52.003
- We all have different talents.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.038
(muffled explosion)

17:54.040 --> 17:57.375
I'm sure you did not
rise to your...

17:57.377 --> 18:00.445
Position through sheer luck.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.147
(artillery fire outside)
(men speaking german)

18:05.517 --> 18:07.752
- Quite right.

18:11.056 --> 18:14.959
Managing people,
that's my talent.

18:17.396 --> 18:20.765
Picking the right person
for the right job.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.701
Just as I did with you
on this project.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.738
And god, I was right.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.308
Look at that craftsmanship.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.744
(distant explosion)
(man speaking german)

18:33.746 --> 18:35.847
(dog barking)

18:39.418 --> 18:43.654
(closing and locking door)

18:45.457 --> 18:47.425
Wish I had more like you.

18:47.427 --> 18:53.965
(men speaking german)
(gunshots outside)

19:05.244 --> 19:07.512
(ambulance siren)

19:11.817 --> 19:13.784
-  <i>Bonjour,</i>audrey.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.786
Sleep well?

19:15.788 --> 19:17.522
- No.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.858
Neeva, can we please go home?
(door closing)

19:20.860 --> 19:23.995
- Good question, mom. You told
her father you'd have them

19:23.997 --> 19:25.930
Back by now.
- Go get your brother

19:25.932 --> 19:28.166
And we talk about it.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.205
- What do you mean,
"talk about it"?

19:34.207 --> 19:36.274
Christ, mother,
you are their employee,

19:36.276 --> 19:40.444
Not part of their family.
- There is danger in that house.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.813
- Audrey, keene,
get your coats on.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.815
- No, you can't!
- Don't argue with me about it.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.718
We're taking them back.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.458
- Ok.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.527
But if it is as I say,

19:56.529 --> 19:58.996
If she is sick,

19:58.998 --> 20:01.199
We will take the children
away from there.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.334
- I'm a nurse, mom;
if mrs. Luss is sick,

20:03.336 --> 20:05.369
I'll know what to do.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.338
Kids, get your coats on.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.574
<i>Vite, s'il vous plait.</i>

20:12.211 --> 20:15.213
(siren blaring and cars honking)

20:20.652 --> 20:22.920
- Dr. Moise said one of the side
effects of corticosteroids

20:22.922 --> 20:26.557
Is weight gain. In your case,
that could be a good thing.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.760
- You haven't a comment
on the elephant in the room?

20:29.762 --> 20:32.263
What happens if
his drug cocktail fails

20:32.265 --> 20:34.332
And my body
rejects the liver?

20:34.334 --> 20:37.168
- Sir, I don't think
it's productive for you

20:37.170 --> 20:39.737
To think about that.
In a few days, I'm sure

20:39.739 --> 20:41.606
We'll look back on this

20:41.608 --> 20:43.941
As a small bump
in the road to your recovery.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.277
- I am most gratified
to hear that.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.616
We're all terribly fond
of eldritch.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.517
- Oh, eichhorst,

20:53.519 --> 20:57.121
I'm not aware that
we're on a first name basis.

21:00.759 --> 21:04.128
- I'll be right outside.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.568
- Your manservant has developed

21:10.570 --> 21:12.603
Misgivings about
the relationship.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.605
- He's a keen judge of character

21:14.607 --> 21:17.408
And very protective.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.311
Understandably.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.813
He's been with me
since his birth.

21:22.815 --> 21:27.051
His parents worked
for my mother and father.

21:27.053 --> 21:30.321
- It's disappointing that it's
no longer a common practice.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.991
- I assumed you've informed
your master

21:33.993 --> 21:37.561
That the plan I've constructed
is unfolding perfectly.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.463
Everyone is focused

21:39.465 --> 21:43.134
On the citizens for liberty
cyber attacks.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.936
And only a small wrinkle:

21:45.938 --> 21:49.340
I've just received
a disturbing voicemail.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.110
- <i>This is jim kent.</i>

21:53.112 --> 21:55.946
<i>Look, I didn't destroy</i>
<i>redfern's body.</i>

21:55.948 --> 21:57.948
<i>I want you to have the german</i>

21:57.950 --> 21:59.917
<i>Bring $100,000 cash</i>

21:59.919 --> 22:02.119
<i>To grand central</i>
<i>at 3:30 this afternoon,</i>

22:02.121 --> 22:04.155
<i>The vanderbilt entrance.</i>

22:04.157 --> 22:07.091
<i>I get the money,</i>
<i>you get redfern's body.</i>

22:07.093 --> 22:09.193
<i>And I'm never</i>
<i>to be heard from again.</i>

22:09.195 --> 22:11.262
- You assured me
that you had

22:11.264 --> 22:13.931
This fellow under control.
- It's a bluff.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.167
Kent would never have
the courage to try this

22:16.169 --> 22:19.103
On his own.
The jew is behind it.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.439
- I thought you were going
to deal with him.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.041
- He has more tenacity
than I thought.

22:24.043 --> 22:27.778
- Well... I hope
it won't be a problem.

22:27.780 --> 22:31.515
- No problem.
I'll take care of it.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.752
- <i>Wunderbar.</i>

22:44.663 --> 22:47.198
(indistinct talking)

23:00.479 --> 23:02.780
(buzzing)

23:08.019 --> 23:11.155
- Felix!
(gus speaking spanish)

23:11.157 --> 23:13.758
(man coughing)

23:13.760 --> 23:15.993
- Make room.

23:18.663 --> 23:21.565
Alright?
(felix panting)

23:23.235 --> 23:25.236
I got you, let's go.

23:25.238 --> 23:28.439
(felix groaning)
I got you.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.441
It's alright. Yo, make room!

23:30.443 --> 23:33.043
- First come, first serve.

23:33.045 --> 23:36.614
Put him back on the floor
where he belongs.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.789
- Get your bitch ass
off the bench!

23:44.791 --> 23:47.925
(men whispering)

23:47.927 --> 23:50.161
- Relax, alright?

23:51.930 --> 23:54.865
Real easy.

23:54.867 --> 23:58.469
- We're being punished
for what we did.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.704
- Stop talking crazy, man.

24:02.407 --> 24:04.475
Rest easy, ok?

24:04.477 --> 24:06.544
I'm gonna get us some help.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.312
We're gonna
get out of this, huh?

24:08.314 --> 24:10.314
Just relax.

24:10.316 --> 24:13.150
You're gonna be alright.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.286
Yo, c.O.!

24:15.288 --> 24:17.288
C.O.!

24:17.290 --> 24:20.324
My friend needs
some help, man. He's sick.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.460
- A paramedic
will come see him.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.662
- When?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.265
When?!

24:28.267 --> 24:30.568
- When he has time.
Now, shut up

24:30.570 --> 24:33.370
Or you'll be needing him too.
(buzzing)

24:35.073 --> 24:37.441
(dog barking)

24:37.443 --> 24:39.510
- Look, sylvia, I'm--
- no, don't bother.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.011
- Look, I'm sorry I lied.

24:41.013 --> 24:44.315
Alright? I was only
trying to protect you.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.750
- Jesus. Let's go.

24:53.091 --> 24:54.992
- Goddamnit!

24:54.994 --> 24:57.228
(sigh)

24:58.830 --> 25:02.266
- She'll come around.
- Will she?

25:02.268 --> 25:05.302
Look, I'm all in with you guys.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.972
Let's hope this works
and the german guy shows up.

25:07.974 --> 25:10.040
- He has too much hubris.
Once challenged,

25:10.042 --> 25:12.943
He will show.
You'll need this.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.548
- I was sort of hoping
for something in the gun family.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.384
- Silver is more effective.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.424
(man shouting in german)

25:29.227 --> 25:31.462
(gun shooting
and artillery fire outside)

25:38.904 --> 25:40.337
(dog barking)

25:40.339 --> 25:42.740
(explosion)
(man shouting in german)

25:42.742 --> 25:45.309
(man speaking german)

25:54.386 --> 25:56.720
(explosion)

25:58.924 --> 26:01.492
(unlocking the door)

26:08.934 --> 26:11.502
- You must pick up the pace,

26:11.504 --> 26:16.740
A230385.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.043
- I'm assuming the urgency

26:19.045 --> 26:22.012
Is from that
russian artillery?

26:22.014 --> 26:24.448
It will get finished.

26:24.450 --> 26:26.917
- I admire your work ethic.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.687
- Where I grew up,
everyone worked hard.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.589
We knew no other way.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.657
- Where do you come from?

26:35.527 --> 26:37.962
- I was born in armenia.
- Uh.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.264
- After the great war,
my family settled

26:40.266 --> 26:42.800
In a little town in romania.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.603
Varsolt.
- Varsolt.

26:45.605 --> 26:48.939
Of course!

26:48.941 --> 26:51.508
I travelled through there!

26:53.311 --> 26:55.913
Summer...

26:55.915 --> 26:57.948
'41!

26:59.951 --> 27:03.387
Has a beautifully preserved
roman castle.

27:10.228 --> 27:12.563
Oh.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.565
Went through the hands

27:14.567 --> 27:17.001
Of many great empires:

27:17.003 --> 27:19.236
The romans...
(pissing in sink)

27:19.238 --> 27:22.473
...Mongols, habsburgs,

27:22.475 --> 27:24.908
The germans.

27:24.910 --> 27:29.513
(two louder explosions)

27:29.515 --> 27:32.650
So, tell me,

27:32.652 --> 27:37.588
A230385...

27:37.590 --> 27:41.091
Do you think we germans
will outlast our predecessors?

27:42.794 --> 27:45.829
(man shouting in german)
(gunshots and artillery fire)

27:45.831 --> 27:47.865
Please.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.301
Speak freely.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.103
Ha! Ha!

27:58.209 --> 28:01.045
- I think the third reich
is in its death throes.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.882
- Very likely.

28:08.553 --> 28:12.156
But suppose...

28:12.158 --> 28:15.325
A new reich rose
from the ashes of this one

28:15.327 --> 28:17.795
Led by a new fuhrer

28:17.797 --> 28:20.698
Who's able to deliver
everything hitler promised

28:20.700 --> 28:22.833
And more.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.802
- I think that would be
a very sad day for humanity.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.870
- Quite the opposite,
my friend.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.039
It's what humanity craves:

28:29.041 --> 28:30.841
A strong leader,

28:30.843 --> 28:32.876
A visionary--
- visionary?

28:32.878 --> 28:35.512
Hitler is a megalomaniac
who declared himself dictator.

28:35.514 --> 28:39.216
- Wrong! Hitler was
elected democratically!

28:39.218 --> 28:41.685
(explosion)
he went before the <i>reichstag.</i>

28:41.687 --> 28:43.654
He asked
the elected representatives

28:43.656 --> 28:47.257
Of the people to grant him
extraordinary powers!

28:47.259 --> 28:50.227
And they did
by an overwhelming majority!

28:50.229 --> 28:52.396
- Because they were terrified.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.765
- Yes! Terrified of democracy!

28:54.767 --> 28:57.034
They had lived
through the chaos

28:57.036 --> 28:58.936
Of the weimar republic:

28:58.938 --> 29:03.073
Governments gridlocked
by parties and bickering!

29:03.075 --> 29:07.111
They realized plato was right.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.413
The republic can only be led

29:09.415 --> 29:11.749
By a philosopher king

29:11.751 --> 29:14.051
With the wisdom

29:14.053 --> 29:16.854
To look after
the needs of the many.

29:16.856 --> 29:20.390
(gunshots outside)
- unless you are a jew.

29:20.392 --> 29:24.061
- Ah... You see?
This is the problem.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.764
You take all of this
too personally.

29:26.766 --> 29:29.433
- After the murder of my family,
I suppose I do.

29:29.435 --> 29:33.303
- Oh, the nobility
of the victim!

29:33.305 --> 29:36.106
(explosion)
I see.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.876
You comfort yourself
with the fantasy

29:38.878 --> 29:42.146
That you're morally superior
to me, but you're not.

29:42.148 --> 29:44.248
First day you arrived,

29:44.250 --> 29:46.383
I asked if anyone
was a carpenter,

29:46.385 --> 29:48.886
And you eagerly threw up
your hands!

29:48.888 --> 29:50.821
And from that day on,
you've labored here,

29:50.823 --> 29:52.923
Working on behalf
of the third reich!

29:52.925 --> 29:56.026
- I had no choice!
- Yes, you have!

29:57.562 --> 30:00.130
But you're afraid
of the choice.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.866
The alternative.

30:05.003 --> 30:08.806
(explosion)
(dog barking)

30:08.808 --> 30:10.908
Here.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.549
Let me make it clearer to you.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.186
(he cocks the pistol.)

30:38.369 --> 30:41.338
If you're quick enough,
you might grab my pistol.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.874
You're going to die anyway

30:43.876 --> 30:45.876
When the trains stop.

30:45.878 --> 30:48.312
Why not go down fighting?

30:48.314 --> 30:50.347
Right here, right now?

30:50.349 --> 30:54.284
Don't you want to try?

31:02.060 --> 31:07.097
(laughing)

31:11.903 --> 31:14.905
It's much easier to do nothing,
isn't it?

31:14.907 --> 31:18.642
Safer.
(distant gunfire)

31:29.754 --> 31:34.391
If that god you believe in
really existed,

31:34.393 --> 31:37.261
What do you suppose
he would think of you?

31:55.079 --> 31:56.947
- See? Look.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.783
I told you,
something evil happened here.

31:59.785 --> 32:02.419
Call the police.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.922
No! No! Keene, no, no!

32:04.924 --> 32:06.957
Wait! Come back here!

32:06.959 --> 32:10.961
No! Oh! Wait! Come back!
Keene! Audrey!

32:10.963 --> 32:12.963
<i>HÃ©, enfants!</i>

32:12.965 --> 32:15.365
- Mommy, where are you?
- Mama, are you home?

32:15.367 --> 32:18.402
Disgusting.
- Mr. Luss?

32:18.404 --> 32:20.804
Miss joan!
- Someone's been sick.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.472
- Audrey!

32:22.474 --> 32:25.142
Miss joan?
(audrey screaming)

32:25.144 --> 32:28.612
You, stay there!

32:28.614 --> 32:33.016
(shrieking)

32:34.485 --> 32:35.819
- Mr. Luss.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.392
- Daddy!

32:42.394 --> 32:44.795
(mr. Luss gasping weirdly)
- sebastiane,

32:44.797 --> 32:46.596
We have to leave.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.566
- We can't. We've got
to take this man to a hospital.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.601
- No! We must go now!
(low growling)

32:51.603 --> 32:53.370
- Oh, god!
- Mama?

32:57.775 --> 32:59.910
- What is that thing?!

32:59.912 --> 33:01.979
-  <i>C'est pas le temps!</i>
<i>La sortie est lÃ !</i>

33:01.981 --> 33:04.548
<i>Sortez! Sortez! Sortez!</i>

33:08.686 --> 33:11.588
- (audrey): Neeva!
(creature screaming)

33:13.524 --> 33:15.892
(growling)

33:17.528 --> 33:19.763
- (neeva): Ah! Ah! Ah!

33:19.765 --> 33:21.698
<i>Allez! Allez, allez!</i>
<i>(audrey screams.)</i>

33:21.700 --> 33:24.701
What is it?

33:24.703 --> 33:26.970
- Open the door!

33:26.972 --> 33:28.972
Neeva! Neeva! Neeva!
(neeva screaming)

33:28.974 --> 33:31.675
- (sebastiane): <i>Vite! Vite!</i>

33:31.677 --> 33:35.112
<i>Non! Non! Enfin! Par lÃ !</i>

33:38.449 --> 33:41.084
- Go quick!
- Help me with the table!

33:46.724 --> 33:48.558
- What's wrong
with my momma?

33:48.560 --> 33:52.095
- An evil <i>loa</i> has possessed her.
He craves food.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.235
(screaming)

33:58.237 --> 33:59.569
- What food?

33:59.571 --> 34:01.238
(creature roaring)

34:01.240 --> 34:02.773
- Ah!

34:04.909 --> 34:07.444
(indistinct pa system message)
(general hubbub)

34:15.219 --> 34:17.421
- Right upstairs.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.623
(indistinct talking)

34:28.499 --> 34:30.901
- (man): I'll call you
when I get there.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.641
- No luggage, mr. Kent?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.045
And no sylvia.

34:42.047 --> 34:44.047
Won't she be joining you
on your train?

34:44.049 --> 34:46.550
- Where's the money?
- Where's the jew?

34:46.552 --> 34:48.718
(man coughing)
- what jew?

34:48.720 --> 34:51.955
- He's here somewhere.
I can smell him.

34:51.957 --> 34:53.924
And he's managed

34:53.926 --> 34:56.059
To recruit you
into his pathetic crusade.

34:56.061 --> 34:58.628
You're now on the wrong side
of history, jim kent.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.931
It's not too late.

35:00.933 --> 35:04.534
You and your wife could still
be part of a glorious new order.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.603
But make the wrong decision here

35:06.605 --> 35:09.573
And you condemn sylvia to
a painful and lingering death.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.542
(indistinct pa system message)

35:14.145 --> 35:15.979
I'll ask you one more time.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.948
Where's the jew?

35:17.950 --> 35:19.749
- Christ, I have no idea.

35:19.751 --> 35:23.086
(train station sounds cut out.)
- I could drink you right here.

35:23.088 --> 35:26.356
(jim panting)
...Turn you.

35:28.059 --> 35:30.861
- If you do anything -
you see those cops over there?

35:32.430 --> 35:34.364
...They'll be all over you.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.238
(the ambient sounds
of the train station return.)

35:41.240 --> 35:44.241
- Well...

35:46.978 --> 35:50.413
Then I guess
you've made your decision.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.551
Consider your wife dead.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.051
- (woman on pa): <i>This is</i>
<i>grand central 47th street.</i>

36:28.053 --> 36:32.889
<i>Transfer to bedford, 6-7</i>
<i>at charlotte to times square.</i>

36:32.891 --> 36:35.492
<i>Connection is available</i>
<i>at bedford.</i>

36:35.494 --> 36:38.695
<i>This is an east-transfer-bound</i>
<i>5 expressway.</i>

36:38.697 --> 36:42.299
<i>Next stop is 51st street.</i>

36:54.679 --> 36:56.646
- (man on pa):
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

36:56.648 --> 36:59.583
<i>We apologize</i>
<i>for the unavoidable delay.</i>

37:01.252 --> 37:04.154
- Eph!

37:24.008 --> 37:26.343
- Shit!

37:28.579 --> 37:32.082
He lost us.

37:32.084 --> 37:34.985
(clanking)

37:50.801 --> 37:53.770
- Jim.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.306
Did you see
where eichhorst went?

37:56.308 --> 37:58.441
- No. Look, he knows
it's a trap.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.043
He's looking for setrakian.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.579
- Did you warn him?
- I didn't see him.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.914
- Alright, we have
to find setrakian. Come on!

38:04.916 --> 38:06.850
- (nora): I saw him
on the first level.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.991
- (man on pa): <i>Train service</i>
<i>between 74th street-broadway,</i>

38:14.993 --> 38:16.993
<i>Above 11th street</i>
<i>and roosevelt avenue,</i>

<i>For further information,</i>

38:23.902 --> 38:26.303
<i>The information desk...</i>

38:30.107 --> 38:32.342
(people talking)

38:38.582 --> 38:40.684

- (pa): <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

38:40.686 --> 38:42.519
<i>We apologize</i>
<i>for the unavoidable delay.</i>

38:42.521 --> 38:46.489

(baby crying)

38:48.659 --> 38:51.127
(coughing)

38:51.129 --> 38:53.663
- (train operator): <i>Stand clear</i>
<i>of the closing doors, please.</i>

38:53.665 --> 38:56.199
<i>Stand clear</i>
<i>of the closing doors.</i>

39:05.209 --> 39:08.778
- (man on pa): <i>Attention,</i>
<i>passengers, the last stop</i>

39:08.780 --> 39:12.382
<i>For pelham bay park</i>
<i>is 3rd avenue-138 street.</i>

39:20.191 --> 39:23.159
(unsheathing a blade)

39:23.161 --> 39:26.996
- A230385,

39:26.998 --> 39:30.567
You really thought
I would lead you to him?

39:35.306 --> 39:37.874
I warned you to stay in jail.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.809
(setrakian gasping)
fitting that

39:39.811 --> 39:41.711
We should end our journey
where it began -

39:41.713 --> 39:44.748
On a train platform.
- This time,

39:44.750 --> 39:46.383
I'm the one with the weapon.

39:46.385 --> 39:49.319
- Sardu's sword, the master
will be pleased

39:49.321 --> 39:51.855
To get it back.
- Then come and take it.

39:51.857 --> 39:54.891
And once again,
you follow a false messiah

39:54.893 --> 39:56.893
Who will prove as horrific

39:56.895 --> 39:59.496
As the last one.

39:59.498 --> 40:02.132
(setrakian grunting)

40:10.608 --> 40:14.744
(gunshot)
(setrakian gasping)

40:14.746 --> 40:16.246
- Grrr!

40:21.252 --> 40:24.721
I give you
another day of life, jew,

40:24.723 --> 40:27.657
For services rendered.

40:41.205 --> 40:43.440
- (jim): Are you alright?

40:44.975 --> 40:47.811
- (man on pa): <i>Seven-train</i>
<i>service has been reduced</i>

40:47.813 --> 40:50.713
<i>Between 74th street-broadway</i>
<i>and queensboro plaza.</i>

40:55.553 --> 40:57.954
- We have a new cook.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.624
Makes his own <i>wurst.</i>
<i>It's quite tasty.</i>

41:01.626 --> 41:03.960
Go on, take it.

41:05.729 --> 41:07.997
You earned it.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.667
(man talking german outside)

41:23.481 --> 41:26.850
You've included every detail.

41:29.086 --> 41:31.721
It's magnificent.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.465
- They're back.

41:42.467 --> 41:45.001
- <i>Benedicta tu in mulieribus.</i>

41:45.003 --> 41:47.270
<i>Tu in mulieribus.</i>

41:47.272 --> 41:49.205
<i>Benedicta fructus ventris.</i>

41:49.207 --> 41:52.509
Oh, papa!
(neeva speaking latin)

41:52.511 --> 41:55.044
(screaming)

41:55.046 --> 41:57.180
(neeva speaking creole)
<i>bon dieu, protÃ©gez-nous.</i>

41:57.182 --> 41:59.682
(low growling)

42:03.120 --> 42:04.687
- Mama.

42:23.340 --> 42:26.075
- Come to me.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.196
Did they injure you?

42:47.198 --> 42:49.832
<i>- Non...</i> No.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.268
- Good.
(siren in the distance)

42:54.071 --> 42:56.573
Bring the young ones to me.

43:07.217 --> 43:09.152
Come over here.

43:11.188 --> 43:13.756
I want to have
a look at you...

43:15.192 --> 43:17.427
...Make sure you're ok.

43:17.429 --> 43:19.762
Did they, uh, scare you?

43:19.764 --> 43:21.864
Huh? I bet they did.

43:21.866 --> 43:23.733
Good.

43:23.735 --> 43:27.136
You look ok.
Come here. How about you?

43:27.138 --> 43:29.272
Did they, uh, hurt you?

43:29.274 --> 43:31.274
No?

43:31.276 --> 43:33.643
Well, that's
a good thing to know,

43:33.645 --> 43:35.612
Huh?

43:35.614 --> 43:37.880
Ah...

43:39.917 --> 43:42.018
And how about you?

43:43.487 --> 43:45.488
- It's just a nick.
I'll be ok.

43:45.490 --> 43:49.158
- Oh. May I see?

43:52.963 --> 43:56.966
Hmmm... Yeah, good.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.135
Good.

43:59.137 --> 44:02.205
Take the children. Go.

44:04.608 --> 44:07.677
- (softly): Come. Go.

44:07.679 --> 44:09.812
- No! Wait a moment.

44:09.814 --> 44:12.348
Wait.

44:16.253 --> 44:19.088
(screaming)

44:19.090 --> 44:22.291
No!
- Be quiet.

44:22.293 --> 44:24.961
Do not touch her.

44:24.963 --> 44:27.196
She is corrupted.
