You know howhe could always tell

05:25.793 --> 05:28.829

14:13.186 --> 14:15.222
No, I thought he'dbe with you...

14:15.255 --> 14:16.823

from acrossthe cafeteria.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.306
Okay?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.175
Kids don't normally gatheraround like that

16:17.410 --> 16:20.147

17:33.720 --> 17:37.324
You know, I heardabout your grandfather.

17:37.357 --> 17:41.494
He was always interestedin how you were doingin school.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.464
And he would alwayswant you to do your best.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.698
I know.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.336
Have a good day, Jake.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.638
One more thing.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.173
Did David tell youthere was somethinggoing on

17:53.206 --> 17:56.543
between me and Richie?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.778
Get to class, Jake.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.614
You just couldn't waitto get me in trouble,huh, Jake?

18:34.647 --> 18:37.550
Your little snitch friendhad to go and tellthe principal.

18:37.584 --> 18:41.154
What? do you thinki told David to goget the principal?

18:41.188 --> 18:42.822
Look, Richie,believe it or not,

18:42.855 --> 18:45.358
we're not afraidof you or your friends.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.628
Oh, you're not afraid?That's it you're askingfor it, white boy.

18:48.661 --> 18:52.432
Then why do you alwayshave to have all theseguys around you?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.067
Do you pay these guysfor protection or what?

18:55.101 --> 18:56.436
- That's it!- Leave it alone

18:56.469 --> 18:57.570
get off me, man.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.539
( Overlapping shouting )

18:59.572 --> 19:02.074
Get off me man!

19:02.108 --> 19:03.376
Come on,give that back!

19:03.410 --> 19:05.778
- Come on!- ( Laughing )

19:05.812 --> 19:07.680
Hey! give that back!

19:07.714 --> 19:09.716
Jeez! come on!

19:09.749 --> 19:11.150
( Booms )

19:27.334 --> 19:28.601
Come on, guys.Let's go.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.352
He saw it.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.361
Look at that.Man can't even get a cupof coffee around here

19:54.394 --> 19:56.363
without missingall the action.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.769
Yes, sir.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.504
Have a nice day.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.341
Jake.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.942
I'm here to help.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.560
What's up, Richie?What's bothering you?

20:27.594 --> 20:29.596
You haven't saida word since I got here.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.831
That box

20:31.864 --> 20:35.568
that Jake hadwith him today.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.903
When I opened it,

20:36.936 --> 20:39.672
I got a weird feelingall over me.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.274
What kindof weird feeling?

20:41.308 --> 20:44.877
I had a visionof a boy

20:44.911 --> 20:47.280
- behind a rock, crying.- Oh, yeah.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.682
My mom gets those,only she calls themhot flashes.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.884
Dude,

20:51.918 --> 20:53.386
listen to what I'm saying.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.322
( Video game beeps )

20:55.355 --> 20:56.689
Not like that.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.229
I had a peaceful feelingall over me.

21:05.798 --> 21:09.702
I felt good.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.270
I thinki'm just gonnahave to stay away

21:11.304 --> 21:13.506
from that guy.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.274
What are your plansfor today, Jake?

21:15.308 --> 21:16.343
Anything special?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.445
Nothing really.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.447
Gonna meet upwith David and we're gonnago to the mall later

21:20.480 --> 21:22.782
and shoot some hoops.They're having an open gymlater.

21:22.815 --> 21:26.653
I think they're recruitingplayers for the team,

21:26.686 --> 21:30.357
but me and davidare just gonna shootsome hoops.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.725
Oh, I have a friendcoming over tonight.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.861
Oh, anyone I know?

21:34.894 --> 21:36.563
No, her name's Anna,she's helping me with somehomework.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.800
Should I order youand Anna some pizzafor dinner?

21:40.833 --> 21:42.502
Yeah, that'dbe great.

21:42.535 --> 21:45.672
She's not coming overuntil 8:00 though.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.840
See ya.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.308

22:21.073 --> 22:22.709

22:22.742 --> 22:24.343

22:28.581 --> 22:30.950
By the way, no cryingwhen you lose, punk.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.522
Shut upand play, snitch.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.949
Hey, Anna's comingover later tonight.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.387

23:08.421 --> 23:10.457

23:10.490 --> 23:12.324
You just don't stop,do ya?

23:12.358 --> 23:14.093
Look Jake,i can't seewhat you see

23:14.126 --> 23:15.728

23:15.762 --> 23:18.498
Maybe Anna will.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.767
What if Anna does feelwhat Richie and I feel?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.435
Why can't you?

23:22.469 --> 23:24.604
I don't know, buddy.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.006
I don't knowwhy I can't see it,or why I can't feel it.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.108
Maybe I'm notsupposed to.

23:29.141 --> 23:32.779
I don't know.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.114
It's just keepingme up at night.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.749
I don't knowwhat to do with it.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.551
All right, well tell mehow it goes, all right?

23:38.585 --> 23:41.721
- You aren't coming?- No, three's a crowd.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.756
And besides,you have to showher the box.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.058
Maybe she can help you.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.627
She goes to church.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.497
You said you seejesus, right?

23:50.530 --> 23:52.164
Maybe he's tryingto tell you something.

23:52.198 --> 23:55.802
Maybe he wants youto go back to church again,jake.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.537
Yeah.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.473
Whatever.

24:00.507 --> 24:04.076
* heedless of the windand weather *

24:04.110 --> 24:05.812
* fa la la la la *

24:05.845 --> 24:07.947
* la la la la *

24:09.415 --> 24:12.151
( carolers chattering )

24:17.790 --> 24:19.659
The same jesusthat was in the box.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.601
- What box?- I'm sorry, what?

24:28.635 --> 24:30.169
You said that'sthe Jesus in the box.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.904
What box?

24:31.938 --> 24:34.707
Oh. never mind.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.042
I was just talkingto myself.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.983
- Can I haveone of those posters?- Here.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.653
Thank you.

24:46.686 --> 24:47.987
Hey...

24:48.020 --> 24:50.089
Merry Christmas.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.558
Merry Christmas.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.968
( Taps )

25:45.845 --> 25:47.780
Jake: mom, come up here, please.

25:47.814 --> 25:50.116
- Mother: what is it Jake? - Just come up here, please

25:50.149 --> 25:51.984
okay, what is it,jake?

25:52.018 --> 25:54.120
Look.

25:54.153 --> 25:57.924
I found outwhat's in here, look.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.660
What is that?

26:00.693 --> 26:02.595
It looks likea nail of some kind.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.802
This is who I see.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.206
Do you thinkit could be oneof those nails?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.042
You sure this iswho you see, Jake?

26:16.075 --> 26:18.277
I thought you saidyou saw a little boyholding the box.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.712
I do seea little boy.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.914
I see a little boyholding the box,

26:21.948 --> 26:24.083
and I see the same boy,except a little older,crying behind a rock.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.056
And then I see jesushanging on the cross.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.759
- Do you believe me?- ( Door bell chimes )

26:41.834 --> 26:43.602
Hi, Mrs. Casper,is Jake home?

26:43.636 --> 26:47.306
Yes, he is.You must be Anna.Come on in.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.609
Let me takeyour coat.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.845
Thank you.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.785
Jake, Anna's here.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.624
Hi.

27:05.658 --> 27:06.859
Mother: Jake, what kind of pizza do you want me to order?

27:06.893 --> 27:08.828
Pepperoni is fine.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.663
- Is that okay with you?- Sure, that's fine.

27:10.697 --> 27:14.033
Awesome.there's somethingi want to show you.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.068
Sit down.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.648
So how did you feelwhen you opened it?

27:29.682 --> 27:32.151
I didn't feelanything.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.120
Okay, look.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.256
There's somethingin here.( Knocks )

27:42.895 --> 27:44.030
What is it?

27:44.063 --> 27:46.232
Some kind of nail.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.738
Jake, where didyou get this?

27:51.771 --> 27:53.105
I found itin my grandpa's store.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.645
He dieda few weeks ago.

28:03.983 --> 28:06.853
So you don'tfeel anythingwhen you hold the nail?

28:06.886 --> 28:11.690
No.what do you mean,jake?

28:11.724 --> 28:12.925
Believe it or not,

28:15.728 --> 28:17.964
when I open the box,i see a vision

28:17.997 --> 28:19.331
of a little boyholding it.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.238
I think I even seejesus hung on the cross.

28:30.877 --> 28:33.712
When I hold the nail

28:33.746 --> 28:35.948
I see a visionof the same boy,

28:35.982 --> 28:38.384
except a little bit older,holding the same box.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.059
It's like...

28:47.093 --> 28:49.395
It's like it'sin a different placein time.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.231
Are you sure?

28:52.264 --> 28:54.466
I didn'tfeel anything?

28:54.500 --> 28:59.005
- Have you had your momor anybody else open the box?- Yeah, but...

28:59.038 --> 29:02.909
- The only person that feltanything was Richie.- Richie?

29:02.942 --> 29:04.210
It's a long storyabout Richie.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.950
That...

29:10.983 --> 29:12.718
Is who I see on the cross.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.991
Do you see the nailthrough his hand?

29:21.760 --> 29:24.130
Could that nail bethe one that hung jesuson the cross?

29:24.163 --> 29:27.934
I don't know.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.869
Is that even possible?

29:29.902 --> 29:31.203
I've never heardof anyone findingthe nails

29:31.237 --> 29:33.940
that crucified Jesus.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.241
I mean, I've heardabout the shroud,

29:35.274 --> 29:38.945
but that's about it.

29:38.978 --> 29:42.248
I heard about it.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.017
People still sayit's fake though.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.129
I have a Bible in my roomthat my grandpa left me.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.869
I think it has picturesof the crucifixion

30:02.902 --> 30:04.370
tell meabout this little boyyou see.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.505
I told you,i see a visionof a little boy

30:06.538 --> 30:10.409
playing with the box.And then the same boy,and the same box,

30:10.442 --> 30:12.511
except a little older.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.881
Crying behind a rock.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.049
Maybe the boy put the nailin the box,

30:17.083 --> 30:19.318
maybe he saw jesusbeing crucified.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.454
I'll be right back.

30:28.527 --> 30:29.962
( Door bell chimes )

30:29.996 --> 30:32.031
Pizza's here.

30:37.536 --> 30:38.905
- Hi.- your pizza.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.306
Yes, how much?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.408
- 144.95.- um, no there--

30:42.441 --> 30:44.510
- 133.95.- there must be a mistake...

30:44.543 --> 30:47.213
- 122.67.- it's supposedto be closer to 20 some...

30:47.246 --> 30:49.148
There's nomistake here, missy.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.017
Hey frank,i got one giving usa hard time--

30:51.050 --> 30:52.284
( laughs )there's no frankover there.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.153
It's just me.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.488
Okay, how muchdo I owe you?

30:58.257 --> 31:00.426
Seven bucks.

31:00.459 --> 31:04.130
I have 30.

31:04.163 --> 31:05.497
Keep the change.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.868
- Thank you.- Merry Christmas.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.573
Jake: mom!

31:14.606 --> 31:16.943
- Check this out.- What? The Bible?

31:16.976 --> 31:19.878
No, I found a noteinside of it.

31:28.187 --> 31:32.458
July 14, 1998.

31:32.491 --> 31:35.294
Today I'm writingthis to let whomeverfinds this letter

31:35.327 --> 31:37.396
know that it'sin my possession.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.031
I have a small wooden box

31:39.065 --> 31:41.000
that is filled with some sort of something

31:41.033 --> 31:42.534
that is beyond my comprehension.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.239
You see the boxcontains nothing.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.875
Yet it feels likesomething is in it.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.578
When I open the box, I immediately get a very peaceful

31:52.611 --> 31:54.446
and beautiful feeling.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.582
You might thinki'm crazy,

31:56.615 --> 31:59.551
but this box is connectedto someone called holy.

31:59.585 --> 32:03.422
It's a feeling that I can't describe.

32:03.455 --> 32:07.994
When I open the box,i see Jesus hangingon the cross.

32:08.027 --> 32:12.531
I can see a young man holding this very box and crying.

32:12.564 --> 32:16.302
While he's watching Jesus being crucified.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.438
I can't help but thinkof my Jake when I getthis feeling.

32:19.471 --> 32:23.109
I'm not sure, but I believe this box is meant to be in Jake's possession.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.012
Carry out something that only he is meant to.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.479
I know that jakewill find this box,

32:27.513 --> 32:30.116
just at the timehe needs it

32:30.149 --> 32:32.384
to fulfill whateverhe has been calledto do.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.258
Jake, what do youthink this means?

32:43.029 --> 32:45.397
Grandpa felt and sawwhat I feel and see.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.637
What if grandpawas right?

32:51.670 --> 32:53.272
What if i'msupposed to do somethingwith the box?

32:58.377 --> 33:00.346
But what?

33:00.379 --> 33:02.214
He never saidwhere he found it.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.116
What if someonegave it to him?

33:12.691 --> 33:15.094
What if grandpa foundthe box where I found it?

33:16.428 --> 33:18.464
What if he left it thereso I would find it?

33:19.731 --> 33:21.700
Someone called holy.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.002
What does thateven mean?

33:24.036 --> 33:27.406
Okay, there isan explanationfor all of this.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.108
There has to be.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.342
You told methat grandpa always talked

33:30.376 --> 33:31.710
about peoplethat came into his shop.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.547
Do you rememberanything about somebody

33:35.581 --> 33:37.949
that gave himthe box.

33:37.983 --> 33:40.119
No. I don't rememberhim saying anything

33:40.152 --> 33:42.188
about anyonegiving him the box.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.989
Maybe somebodysold it to him.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.624
( Sighs )i don't know,maybe he did--

33:45.657 --> 33:48.094
I just don't understandhow I only know three people

33:48.127 --> 33:51.963
that felt what I feltwhen I opened the box.

33:51.997 --> 33:56.168
Why didn't you, Anna,or David feel anything?

33:56.202 --> 33:58.370
Why just me, grandpa,and Richie?

33:58.404 --> 34:00.772
How do you know richiefeels what you feel,jake?

34:00.806 --> 34:03.575
Does he knowabout the box?

34:03.609 --> 34:05.477
He opened it.

34:07.313 --> 34:08.480
He didn't sayanything, but...

34:12.284 --> 34:14.719
I know he felt it.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.522
That's whati don't understand,

34:16.554 --> 34:19.091
Richie is nota nice guy.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.492
Wait, is thatthe same Richie

34:20.525 --> 34:22.128
that cameto your birthday partywhen you were 10

34:22.161 --> 34:25.563
and poppedall of the balloons?That Richie?

34:25.597 --> 34:30.068
- Wasn't he sickor something?- Yeah, that's him.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.103
- ( Door bell chimes )- ( knocking )

34:32.138 --> 34:34.406
Looks like it's timefor me to go.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.342
I'll get it.

34:37.376 --> 34:41.079
Look, don't tell my momthat Richie bullies me.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.648
She'll freak.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.451
I'm Anna's sister,here to pick her up.

34:45.484 --> 34:46.717
Anna!

34:46.752 --> 34:49.688
- Call me tomorrow, okay?- Anna.

34:49.721 --> 34:53.792
- Ready to go home, punk?- I'm so sorry, I thoughtmy mom was picking me up.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.694
- What does that mean?- Is this your sister?

34:55.726 --> 35:00.666
- You can pick me upif you want me to.- Yeah.

35:00.699 --> 35:04.102
Jess, we gotta go.

35:04.136 --> 35:08.106
Open the door.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.376
You don't want meto come in, do you?

35:10.409 --> 35:13.212
Oh is that him?Even you can do betterthan that.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.480
He's not my boyfriend.

35:14.513 --> 35:17.816
Right! later, boyfriend.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.252
Anna: why do you always do this to me?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.663
Maybe you shouldtalk to pastor mikeabout all of this.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.469
Look, mom.

35:37.503 --> 35:40.539
I don't knowwhat to make of anyof this either, but

35:40.572 --> 35:41.673
you know the last timei went to church

35:41.707 --> 35:43.209
was for grandpa'sfuneral.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.648
I just don't wantto go back to the place

35:49.681 --> 35:52.884
I had to say goodbyeto him, you know?

35:52.918 --> 35:56.788
If you think you needto talk to pastor Mike,i can invite him over here.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.457
I'm gonna go to bed.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.625
- Let me thinkabout it.- Okay.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.327
Good night, honey.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.661
Jake: good morning, mom.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.863
- Good morning.- Did you get any sleep?

36:04.896 --> 36:09.134
Uh no, not really.How about you?

36:09.167 --> 36:10.802
Not really.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.506
I opened the box,though.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.712
There's somethingso powerful about it.

36:25.251 --> 36:28.254
It doesn'tscare me, though.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.822
Like I said,maybe you should talkto pastor Mike about that.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.192
He can at leastgive you his opinion

36:34.226 --> 36:37.896
about what you see and feelwhen you open the box.

36:40.366 --> 36:43.802
Hey. I never thoughtabout this, but

36:43.835 --> 36:47.239
this looksjust like Mrs. rousso.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.408
What?

36:49.441 --> 36:51.477
Doesn't that lookjust like Mrs. rousso?

36:51.510 --> 36:52.878
( Laughs )

36:52.911 --> 36:54.580
Right?

36:54.613 --> 36:57.249
Yeah, like a youngmrs. Rousso.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.223
- That's it, mom.- What's it?

37:05.257 --> 37:06.892
Mrs. rousso.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.361
Do you think she knowsanything about the box?

37:09.395 --> 37:10.929
You said that herand grandpa werebest friends.

37:10.962 --> 37:14.600
Didn't they get coffeelike every day?

37:14.633 --> 37:16.201
Maybe she just nevertold us about the box

37:16.234 --> 37:20.439
because we never asked.Come on.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.807
Let's go.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.610
Uh, give me a secondto get ready, will ya?

37:26.211 --> 37:27.546
( Sighs )

37:31.417 --> 37:33.184
Richie, you better tellthe doctor everything,

37:33.218 --> 37:35.387
because if you don't,i will.

37:35.421 --> 37:38.790
Okay, I told you,i'm gonna tell themeverything.

37:41.293 --> 37:42.561
The doctor willbe right in.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.273
Mrs. leal.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.476
- It's nice to see you.- Nice to see you, doctor.

37:59.345 --> 38:00.879
There's Richie.How ya doing?

38:08.554 --> 38:10.221
Looks like you'velost some weight,

38:10.255 --> 38:12.858
how long haveyou had this cough?

38:12.891 --> 38:15.761
I guess, I've had itfor a few days now--

38:15.794 --> 38:18.697
he's had the coughfor a week.

38:18.730 --> 38:21.467
- And he won't eat.- Ma, please!

38:21.500 --> 38:24.470
Why aren'tyou eating, Richie?What's up with that?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.639
I'm just not hungrythese days.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.880
Connie, would youplease excuse us?

38:34.913 --> 38:36.782
I need to takea good look at Richie.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.717
Make yourself at homein the waiting area.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.586
I'll come and get youwhen we're done.

38:48.059 --> 38:51.463
Look, Richie.It looks like I'm gonnahave to admit you.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.932
I'm not takingany chances.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.334
Come on, doc.It's Christmas time.

38:56.368 --> 38:58.870
I know.You wanna be homefor Christmas.

38:58.904 --> 39:01.840
I get it. But lookat the weather out here.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.910
People are runningaround with coldand flu bugs.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.277
Stuff like thatcould kill you.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.914
And you know it.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.616
I'll go outand I'll talk to mom,

39:10.649 --> 39:12.718
and I'll let her knowwhat's going on.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.420
We'll getthe paperwork started.

39:16.522 --> 39:17.756
Hang in there.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.566
- Need help with that, ma?- Oh, no thanks,

39:27.599 --> 39:28.967
- I'm almost done.- All right.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.702
Where's your coat?

39:30.736 --> 39:32.571
This is my coat.

39:32.604 --> 39:33.872
( Laughs )all right look,

39:33.905 --> 39:36.408
I'm gonna go meetthe guys at the arcade.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.309
Those video gamesare a waste of time.

39:38.343 --> 39:39.511
Would it kill youto read a book

39:39.545 --> 39:40.979
every once in a while?

39:41.012 --> 39:42.681
It might.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.716
I don't wantto take the chance.( Laughs )

39:49.955 --> 39:51.590
Richie, I knew it.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.759
You're not well.

39:53.792 --> 39:57.829
Ma, it's okay.I'll be in the hospitalfor just a few days.

39:57.863 --> 39:59.598
I'll be outby Christmas time.

39:59.631 --> 40:03.469
( Coughs )

40:03.502 --> 40:07.606
You know, christmaswon't mean anything to mewithout you.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.775
I just want youto be healthy.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.710
( Door opens )

40:16.682 --> 40:18.917
Richie,this is some paperworkthat you and your mom

40:18.950 --> 40:21.152
need to takeover to the first floor.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.354
From there,they will take youto your room.

40:23.388 --> 40:24.656
You know the routine.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.658
I'm sorryyou have to be here.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.827
I hate this.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.529
Mrs. rousso: What's this Jake tells me?

40:30.562 --> 40:32.363
You havesome questions?

40:32.397 --> 40:33.999
Well, I thinkjake is the onewith the questions.

40:39.971 --> 40:44.409
Huh.well, I knowthis box.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.712
Your grandfathershowed it to me before.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.179
Did he giveit to you?

40:48.213 --> 40:52.951
No. no, he didn'texactly give it to me.

40:52.984 --> 40:55.587
Open it.

40:55.621 --> 40:57.122
I want youto open it.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.738
Do you feelor see anythingwhen you open it?

41:13.872 --> 41:15.140
Have you calledyour father?

41:15.173 --> 41:19.177
His shift is almost donefor the day?

41:19.210 --> 41:23.782
Yes, I called paco, too.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.651
( Coughs )

41:27.986 --> 41:31.122
Why don't yougo home, mom?

41:31.156 --> 41:33.424
I'll wait for dad.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.727
I'll waitfor him, too.

41:35.761 --> 41:36.928
I'll go home later,

41:36.962 --> 41:40.131
I wanna talkto the doctor.

41:40.165 --> 41:43.969
Is this room coldor is it just me?

41:48.640 --> 41:50.241
Congratulations,mr. and Mrs. leal.

41:53.478 --> 41:55.747
Say hi,to your new mommyand daddy, Richie.

41:55.781 --> 41:57.816
Hello,mommy and daddy.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.718
( Laughing )

41:59.751 --> 42:04.122
- He's beautiful.- He's perfect.

42:04.155 --> 42:07.025
Welcome home, Richie.

42:10.929 --> 42:13.264
Lord, please takecare of my son.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.005
( Sighs )

42:20.038 --> 42:22.040
Jake,

42:22.073 --> 42:24.676
you felt whatyour grandfather felt

42:24.710 --> 42:28.013
when he openedthis box.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.716
You know,he even said,

42:30.749 --> 42:33.852
"i have no ideawhat heaven is like,

42:33.885 --> 42:36.822
but if it feelslike it does when I openthe box,

42:36.855 --> 42:38.890
then I can't waitto get there."

42:38.924 --> 42:42.160
When he used to say,"i get a special feeling."

42:42.193 --> 42:45.697
I thought he was losinghis mind or something.

42:45.731 --> 42:47.766
I mean, no offense,maggie, but...

42:47.799 --> 42:48.967
None taken.

42:54.640 --> 42:58.543
- Man, it's cold out there.- Yeah, I know.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.045
Have you heardabout Richie?

43:00.078 --> 43:02.914
No, what about him?

43:02.948 --> 43:04.616
He's in the hospital.

43:04.650 --> 43:06.084
He's sick again.

43:06.117 --> 43:08.186
What do you mean,sick again?

43:08.219 --> 43:11.156
Cancer's back.

43:11.189 --> 43:13.659
He's not doingtoo good.

43:13.692 --> 43:17.763
I mean... I meanit doesn't look good,you know?

43:17.796 --> 43:19.330
I have a bad feelingabout this.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.199
Hey, you wantto go see him, man?

43:21.232 --> 43:22.734
No.

43:22.768 --> 43:24.636
They won't let us in.

43:24.670 --> 43:28.039
Besides, Richie said it'stoo far for us to go.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.008
Fine.

43:30.041 --> 43:33.712
Now, let's go playthat boxing gameover there.

43:33.745 --> 43:35.546
The box.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.783
What box?

43:37.816 --> 43:39.150
The box that Jake had.

43:39.184 --> 43:41.687
That Richie picked upoff the ground.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.189
Remember whenthey fought at the schoolthe other day.

43:44.222 --> 43:46.792
Yeah, what about it?

43:46.825 --> 43:49.928
Well, that night,richie told me something.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.897
It was reallybothering him.

43:51.930 --> 43:54.766
He said thatwhen he opened the box,

43:54.800 --> 43:57.068
something cameover him.

43:57.102 --> 43:59.170
Something...peaceful.

43:59.204 --> 44:00.605
That's crazy, man.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.240
I don't knowwhat that means,

44:02.273 --> 44:05.343
but somethingtells me that we needto go find Jake.

44:05.376 --> 44:07.713
Well do you knowwhere to find him?

44:07.746 --> 44:10.615
No. there's waysto find him.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.284
Let's go.

44:13.318 --> 44:16.654
Man, I still don't knowwhat that little boxcan do for Richie.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.229
Did he ever mentionwhat was in the box?

44:24.262 --> 44:27.198
He always saidhe felt like the box

44:27.232 --> 44:30.268
held somethingspecial inside.

44:30.301 --> 44:32.370
Although, he nevercould find it.

44:32.403 --> 44:33.671
And you know, the box,

44:33.705 --> 44:35.673
the box hadsome weight to it.

44:35.707 --> 44:38.043
I bet you twodon't know this.

44:38.076 --> 44:39.177
Your grandfathertook care

44:39.210 --> 44:42.613
of a homeless manfor a while.

44:42.647 --> 44:44.215
He'd come in hereand he'd get his meals.

44:44.249 --> 44:46.417
And your grandfatherwould pay for it.

44:46.451 --> 44:50.621
He even let him stayin the back of his storefor a few weeks.

44:50.655 --> 44:52.290
I bet you didn'tknow that, Maggie.

44:52.323 --> 44:53.925
Nope.

44:53.959 --> 44:58.229
Anyway, the first timei saw that box,

44:58.263 --> 45:00.665
was shortly afterholy disappeared.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.367
So I alwaysjust believed,

45:02.400 --> 45:05.270
holy gave himthe box.

45:05.303 --> 45:08.139
He never mentionedanything like thatto me.

45:08.173 --> 45:10.641
Although, I guessit's because I probablywould have told dad

45:10.675 --> 45:12.744
to makethe homeless manleave the shop.

45:16.147 --> 45:18.817
Huh. well, I'll be.

45:18.850 --> 45:22.754
He was right.

45:22.788 --> 45:24.655
There is somethingin there.

45:24.689 --> 45:26.892
What is it?

45:26.925 --> 45:28.159
I don't know.

45:32.163 --> 45:33.364
I think it'ssome kind of nail.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.834
May I?

45:40.338 --> 45:41.807
You know,just a few months

45:41.840 --> 45:43.741
before your grandpapassed.

45:43.775 --> 45:47.278
He told me he wasgoing to hide the boxin the store.

45:47.312 --> 45:49.314
( Chuckles )and that if youhad anything

45:49.347 --> 45:51.682
to do with it, Jake,

45:51.716 --> 45:55.053
you would findthe box.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.387
And he believed

45:56.421 --> 45:59.357
somehowthe box would end upin your hands.

45:59.390 --> 46:01.026
At justthe right time.

46:01.059 --> 46:04.095
You mentioned, holy.

46:04.129 --> 46:05.330
Was that the homelessguy's name?

46:09.134 --> 46:11.202
He saidhe was knownas holy.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.342
Holy...like god holy,

46:17.375 --> 46:21.146
or holey likeholey clothes.

46:21.179 --> 46:23.314
When your grandfathertold me he was gonna

46:23.348 --> 46:25.183
let this guystay in his shop,

46:25.216 --> 46:28.887
I did my research.I went around

46:28.920 --> 46:31.322
and I askeda lot of questions.

46:31.356 --> 46:34.492
And everyone I askedsaid he was harmless.

46:34.525 --> 46:36.828
Just a kind old man.

46:42.267 --> 46:43.368
Hey mom, do youknow how Jesus

46:43.401 --> 46:45.303
was nailedto the cross?

46:45.336 --> 46:49.374
Well, he diedso that you and icould have life.

46:49.407 --> 46:52.844
Yeah, I know that,but were the nails

46:52.878 --> 46:55.180
through his handsor his wrists.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.314
I'm not sure.

46:56.347 --> 46:57.748
I see some pictureswith the nails

46:57.782 --> 46:59.284
through his hands,and some pictures

46:59.317 --> 47:01.853
with the nailsthrough his wrists.

47:01.887 --> 47:04.055
I can't reallytell you any morethan I already know.

47:04.089 --> 47:06.524
Do you knowwhere holy is now?

47:06.557 --> 47:09.160
You know,i can't say, Jake.

47:09.194 --> 47:11.863
After he leftyour grandpa's shop,

47:11.897 --> 47:14.099
nobody ever sawhim again. I mean...

47:14.132 --> 47:17.235
Seems likehe just disappeared.

47:18.436 --> 47:19.905
I asked about himfor a while,

47:19.938 --> 47:23.008
but nobody'sever seen him again.

47:23.041 --> 47:24.242
He truly wasa kind old man

47:24.275 --> 47:26.411
that never didany harm to anyone.

47:26.444 --> 47:28.213
And you knowanother thing,

47:28.246 --> 47:32.150
he used to hand outthese little woodencrosses,

47:32.183 --> 47:33.784
I don't even knowwhere he got them.

47:33.818 --> 47:35.253
I we needto get going.I have to stop

47:35.286 --> 47:37.322
by the churchand drop offsome boxes.

47:37.355 --> 47:39.857

47:39.891 --> 47:42.193

48:23.501 --> 48:26.604

48:30.075 --> 48:33.244

51:16.307 --> 51:18.809

Hey Cindy,did you find Jake?

52:10.695 --> 52:12.697

53:35.713 --> 53:37.482
Pastor Mike:What can I dofor you, Jake?

53:37.515 --> 53:39.584
By the way,i know how hard it was

53:39.617 --> 53:41.486
for you to loseyour grandfather.

53:41.519 --> 53:44.255
He did great thingsfor this church.

53:44.289 --> 53:46.624
He's missed dearly.

53:46.657 --> 53:49.360
Thanks, pastor.

53:49.394 --> 53:50.795
It just feels weirdbeing at churchwithout him,

53:50.828 --> 53:53.598
but I feel likehe's with me right now.

53:56.233 --> 53:58.303
What'son your mind, Jake?

53:58.336 --> 53:59.504
It's about this.

54:03.308 --> 54:05.310
Do you knowwhat this box is,pastor?

54:15.686 --> 54:17.422
Do you see anythingwhen you open it?

54:17.455 --> 54:19.657
Yes.

54:19.690 --> 54:22.393
And I'm almost sureyou're going to tell methat you do too.

54:22.427 --> 54:23.794
Aren't you?

54:23.828 --> 54:26.364
I do.

54:26.397 --> 54:27.698
My grandfather feltsomething too,

54:27.732 --> 54:30.000
he wrote a letterabout it in his Bible.

54:30.034 --> 54:32.269
I know he did, Jake.

54:32.303 --> 54:34.305
I told himto write it.

54:34.339 --> 54:37.375
You see, this is notthe first time that i'veseen this box.

54:37.408 --> 54:39.844
A few years ago,your grandfather came byto see me

54:39.877 --> 54:41.779
and his brought this boxwith him.

54:41.812 --> 54:43.914
He told meall about it.

54:43.948 --> 54:45.850
Did he tell youabout holy?

54:45.883 --> 54:47.685
Or the nailthat's in it?

54:47.718 --> 54:50.721
Yes. I know about holy,he told me all about him.

54:50.755 --> 54:53.324
He never told meabout the nail.

54:53.358 --> 54:55.259
May I seethe nail?

54:55.292 --> 54:56.827
Sure, pastor.

54:59.664 --> 55:02.433
Would you lookat that?

55:02.467 --> 55:05.035
I guess your grandfathernever knew about this.

55:05.069 --> 55:07.938
- May I take it out?- Sure.

55:07.972 --> 55:12.276
Like, wait.Holy, who is that?

55:12.309 --> 55:15.646
He's some homeless guythat my grandfathertook care of.

55:15.680 --> 55:18.849
And there'sanother thing,pastor.

55:18.883 --> 55:21.986
Why can'tdavid feel anythingwhen he opens the box?

55:22.019 --> 55:25.490
It's not that davidisn't a good personor anything like that.

55:25.523 --> 55:28.826
We may never know whyonly some people can feelsomething with this box.

55:30.828 --> 55:34.298
Your grandfather told methat he had a dream.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.601
That holy leftthis box with him

55:36.634 --> 55:38.769
in orderto get it to you.

55:38.803 --> 55:41.372
And he might be right.

55:41.406 --> 55:43.541
The lord couldbe using you to complete

55:43.574 --> 55:44.642
a purposewith this box?

55:44.675 --> 55:46.577
For what purpose?

55:46.611 --> 55:48.546
I can't figure it out,i don't know what to dowith it.

55:48.579 --> 55:52.450
( Phone rings )excuse me, gentlemen.

55:52.483 --> 55:55.386
It's pastor Mike.Hey, it's good to--

56:17.374 --> 56:19.777

Yeah. I told herabout everything.

56:22.513 --> 56:23.781
Well, have youlet her hold the box?

56:23.814 --> 56:25.516
Did she get any feelingsor see anything?

56:25.550 --> 56:29.053
No. nothing.

56:29.086 --> 56:31.088
As far as I can tell,the only three peoplethat feel anything

56:31.121 --> 56:32.957
are you, me and Richie.

56:32.990 --> 56:34.425
Richie?richie who?

56:34.459 --> 56:35.693
Richie leal.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.895

56:37.928 --> 56:41.098
I'm not too sure,although I heard todayhe's in the hospital.

56:41.131 --> 56:43.400
And he's really sick.

56:43.434 --> 56:45.436
I got in a fightwith him a week agoand he opened the box.

56:49.440 --> 56:53.343
I know this isgonna sound crazy,

56:53.377 --> 56:55.613
but I knowthat he felt something.I just know it.

56:55.646 --> 56:56.881
Jake,

56:58.716 --> 57:00.551
I just got off the phonewith Richie's dad.

57:00.585 --> 57:02.553

57:02.587 --> 57:05.623
his leukemia is back,and he is very ill.

57:05.656 --> 57:08.626
Why would he call you?Do you know him?

57:08.659 --> 57:10.695
I've known richiesince he was just a kid.

57:10.728 --> 57:12.797
Richie and paco used to cometo vacation Bible school

57:12.830 --> 57:15.733
every summer before youstarted coming to church.

57:15.766 --> 57:18.903
That's it.

57:18.936 --> 57:21.506
We need to getthe box to richieso he can get better.

57:58.576 --> 58:01.478
I don't know, mom.I got a bad feelingabout Richie.

58:01.512 --> 58:04.481
I know what you mean.I talked to connieearlier today,

58:04.515 --> 58:07.151
she's really scaredfor Richie.

58:07.184 --> 58:08.719
Poor Connie.

58:08.753 --> 58:11.856
I think I mightgo see him tonight.

58:11.889 --> 58:13.423
I remember I usedto take care of Richie

58:13.457 --> 58:15.225
when he wasa little boy.

58:15.259 --> 58:17.061
Connie and richardboth had to work.

58:17.094 --> 58:18.663
They lived right downthe street.

58:18.696 --> 58:20.464
You rememberthat, paco?

58:20.497 --> 58:24.001
You and richiewere a handfultogether.

58:24.034 --> 58:26.470
Man...

58:26.503 --> 58:28.639
Jake betterget that boxto Richie.

58:28.673 --> 58:29.874
What box?

58:29.907 --> 58:31.776
Oh. nothing.

58:34.712 --> 58:37.815
( Cell phone rings )

58:41.151 --> 58:42.720
- Hello.- hey, it's me.

58:42.753 --> 58:45.155
David and Jake are at the hospital.

58:45.189 --> 58:46.991
- They're where?- Yeah, I heard they went there with their pastor.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.659
You're kidding me!

58:48.693 --> 58:50.661
I have a feeling we need to get up there.

58:50.695 --> 58:52.830
Okay, yeah, I just gottaput my coat on.

58:52.863 --> 58:55.199
Okay. Anna and I will meet you up there.

58:55.232 --> 58:58.235
Sounds good.

58:58.268 --> 58:59.804
What's the matter?What's going on?

58:59.837 --> 59:01.672
I need to go see him.

59:01.706 --> 59:03.207
Is there somethingyou're not telling me,paco?

59:08.879 --> 59:10.147
Thank you.

59:12.817 --> 59:14.985
Will the doctor be into see Richie?

59:15.019 --> 59:16.987
It'll betomorrow morning.

59:17.021 --> 59:19.724
He still is waitingfor more test resultsto come back in.

59:19.757 --> 59:21.626
But he usually makeshis rounds pretty early,

59:21.659 --> 59:24.228
so hopefullyrichie's results willbe back by then.

59:24.261 --> 59:28.966
I know he's waitingfor those before he comesto talk to you.

59:28.999 --> 59:31.101
Can we staywith him tonight?

59:31.135 --> 59:34.772
Yeah... I need to gocall the doctor.

59:34.805 --> 59:36.140
His "sats" are not good.

59:37.675 --> 59:40.277
What do you mean"not good"?

59:40.310 --> 59:42.246
Um...let me go callthe doctor,

59:42.279 --> 59:44.281
he might still be herein the hospital.

59:44.314 --> 59:46.083
And whatif he's not?

59:46.116 --> 59:47.918
Mrs. leal, it's okay.We always have

59:47.952 --> 59:49.987
a doctor on call,let me just go get him.

01:00:01.766 --> 01:00:03.267
Connie, do youremember

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:08.138
the day that weadopted Richie?

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:10.607
And I went downto the store and gotyou a coffee

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:13.678
- like I did today.- You did that many times,richard.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:16.013
- We were herewith Richie for weeks.- I know.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:17.648
But the first time,

01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:19.684
do you rememberwhat happened?

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:22.186
What happened?

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:25.589
I was walkingto the store,

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.892
and I saw an old man.

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:30.728
He was getting beat up really bad in an alley.

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.697
And I remember running towards him

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.165
and the guys ran away.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:37.067
He was hurt really bad.

01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:40.871
I picked him up and carried him to the hospital.

01:00:40.905 --> 01:00:42.339
He was bleeding. And when they put him

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.709
on to the hospital bed,

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:49.346
a little wooden cross fell out of his pocket.

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:51.215
And I remember him looking at me and saying

01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:52.817
he would repay me someday,

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.920
for the act of kindness.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:57.955
Maggie: okay, I do remember that.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:01.125
I was mad at youfor not bringing me backa coffee.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:05.696
Yeah, I just rememberhow thankful he was.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:10.701
I wonder whateverhappened to him.

01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:13.103
Who knows.

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:32.689
Good evening,we are here to seerichie leal,

Can you tell us wherehis room is, please?

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.194
It's aftervisiting hours.

And you won'tbe able to see himuntil tomorrow.

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:40.097
I know, it's notvisiting hours.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.132
But I'm a pastor,

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:44.001

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.804

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:53.377
( Sighs )

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.279
You know the rules.

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:57.181
You're the only onethat can go up.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.383

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:27.878
I was young once.

01:02:27.912 --> 01:02:29.213
And I'm not stupid.

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:34.718
Would you like meto drop the book offtomorrow?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.888

when Jake and richiewere gonna fight,

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:42.039
that night,he said when heopened the box,

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:43.573

Did he tell youwhat he felt?

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.311

I thinkhe feels what I feelwhen I open the box.

01:05:56.586 --> 01:06:00.124
Did he tell youwhat he saw?

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:04.094
He said he saw a boy,playing with the box.

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:09.266
But in a differentplace in time.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:13.103
Like when jesuswas on earth.

01:06:13.137 --> 01:06:14.371
Then he saidhe said he saw

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:18.475
the same boycrying behind a rock.

01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:22.646
- And then he saw Jesus--- from the cross.

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:25.715
Yeah. I see that too.

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:29.919

Like there wasnot one thing wrongwith his whole body.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:40.597

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:36.713
Anna, I'm at the room.Get everyone up here.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:53.362
Uh, doctor?

01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:54.664
His vitals are normal.

01:13:54.698 --> 01:13:57.066
Yeah...i can see that.

01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:00.804
Cancel code.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.912
Those readings,does that mean

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.515
that the canceris no longer present?

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:13.182
Well we'redefinitely gonna needto run some more tests

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:15.485
in the morning,guaranteed,

01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:18.154
but between all of usand the iv poll,

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:21.725
I've neversee anything like thisin my entire career.

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.527
If the cancerwere still here,

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.128
the color wouldn'tbe back in his face.

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.163
And the his vitalswould not be backto normal.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.732

I feel likei haven't eatenin days.

01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:47.984
I'm so hungry.

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.007
There are too manypeople in the room,

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.475
I need you guysgo into the waiting room

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.844

You, my friend,have just been a partof a beautiful miracle.

01:15:30.894 --> 01:15:32.528
Was it a dream?

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:33.763
Hey, guys.What's going on?

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:39.669

01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:45.474

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:47.010
It wasn't me,and you know it.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:56.519
Well, look.I don't knowabout all of you,

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.188
but tonight,i felt somethingin my heart

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.858

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.227
And I wouldgive anything

It's notthe box, sir.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.889

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:22.906
And merry Christmas.

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:25.174
I'd like to startby sharing somethingwith all of you

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:28.011
that happenedjust a few days ago.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:31.014
These kidsare about to tell youa true story,

01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:34.017
of what Jesus christhas done for them.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.986
I know,because I was there.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.923
So, let'sget started.

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:41.624
Jake?

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.326
( Applause )

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:50.366
Thanks so much,pastor Mike.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:54.704
( Microphone feeds back )

01:17:54.738 --> 01:17:57.606
Hello, everyone.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.809
My name isjake Casper.

01:17:59.843 --> 01:18:03.212
Wow, there's a lotof people here today.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:13.389
Well,it's been an amazing week,to say the least.

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:29.739
If you believethat Jesus christisn't performing

01:18:29.773 --> 01:18:30.974
any miraclesthese days,

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:37.680
and it's impossibleto love even your worstenemies,

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.783
sit back,

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:41.217
and listento our story.

01:18:43.787 --> 01:18:46.055
A true story that beginswith a small wooden box.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:49.893
I call itthe messenger's box.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:56.933
And somewhere

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:58.768
tucked awayin the atticsof our hearts,

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:02.972
we all havea messenger's box.

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:09.445
But make no mistake,it's not about the boxitself.

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:13.216
It's about what'sin the box.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:19.755
And if you findyourself in a hopelesssituation today,

01:19:22.725 --> 01:19:24.027
no matter what it is.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:30.066
No matter how darkthat situation may seem.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.902
There is hope.

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:37.974
And that hope

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:39.375
is in Jesus Christ.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:47.150
You see,

01:19:47.183 --> 01:19:49.218
we are notguaranteed tomorrow,

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.922
or even the next minute.

01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:58.427
So after you hearour story,

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:00.396
I'd like eachand every one of you,

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:01.965
to answerthese questions.

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:12.308
Have you foundyour messenger's box?

01:20:18.114 --> 01:20:19.815
Have you opened it?

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.258
And if you haven't,

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:36.365
what are youwaiting for?

01:20:40.136 --> 01:20:45.008
