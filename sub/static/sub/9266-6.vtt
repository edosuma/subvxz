WEBVTT

00:03.294 --> 00:04.595
- No.

00:04.629 --> 00:06.897
I can't do this.

00:06.931 --> 00:10.000
- My name's luke.
- I know who you are.

00:10.034 --> 00:12.269
- It's your dad.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.503
He was killed.

00:13.538 --> 00:15.339
[sobbing]
I'm sorry.

00:15.373 --> 00:18.342
Are you all right?

00:18.376 --> 00:21.011
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:29.921 --> 00:32.923
- And this Friday's game between
the east dillon lions

00:32.957 --> 00:35.592
And the mcnulty mavericks
promises to be a barn burner,

00:35.627 --> 00:38.829
At least on one side
of the ball.

00:38.863 --> 00:41.031
Mcnulty is the favorite to upset
the panthers' reign this year,

00:41.065 --> 00:44.735
And their undefeated record
has them in prime position

00:44.769 --> 00:46.670
For that playoff spot.

00:46.704 --> 00:48.672
You got to wonder
how fast and how often

00:48.706 --> 00:50.574
This mcnulty offense
is gonna score

00:50.608 --> 00:52.376
On this poor lions' defense.

00:52.410 --> 00:53.877
Flip the tv on
for this game.

00:53.911 --> 00:55.512
It's gonna be a track meet.

00:55.546 --> 00:57.381
- You hear that, man?

00:57.415 --> 00:58.382
You one sorry, brother.
You know that, vince?

00:58.416 --> 01:00.017
- Go ahead, cal.

01:00.051 --> 01:02.286
- I mean, it's one thing
to be on the team that sucks.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.254
It's a whole other thing
to be on a team

01:04.289 --> 01:07.157
That suck on tv,
all right?

01:07.191 --> 01:09.693
Everybody watching too?
[laughs]

01:09.727 --> 01:11.461
- Calvin, shut up.
- Couldn't be me, man.

01:11.496 --> 01:12.562
- All right, yeah, I know.

01:12.597 --> 01:13.563
- That's why I quit that
sorry-ass team.

01:13.598 --> 01:15.198
You know what
I'm saying?

01:15.233 --> 01:18.001
- Mcnulty's averaging
53 points a game.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.937
They got the second ranked
offense in the state.

01:20.972 --> 01:23.073
Coach, they've only punted twice
the whole damn season.

01:23.107 --> 01:24.875
- Friday, we are gonna
keep it simple.

01:24.909 --> 01:26.443
- These are offensive plays.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.944
- "offensive," stan.

01:27.979 --> 01:29.246
"offensive" plays.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.514
- Listen up now.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.683
Mcnulty's undefeated.
Game's televised.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.685
It's a game-changer.
I don't like it.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.853
- That's what
I'm talking about.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.722
- What we're gonna do
is we're gonna

01:38.756 --> 01:40.624
Go down to the field
with the media.

01:40.658 --> 01:44.628
We're gonna talk briefly
with the reporters.

01:44.662 --> 01:49.366
- All right,
let's keep it simple.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.268
- I'm not finished.

01:59.110 --> 02:00.744
- Wait, wait, wait.

02:00.778 --> 02:02.312
I totally just
remembered something.

02:02.347 --> 02:04.281
- Oh, no.
What? You're pregnant?

02:04.315 --> 02:06.149
- [chuckles]
- you are, aren't you?

02:06.184 --> 02:08.785
- I'm having twins actually,
but they're aliens.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.287
- Damn it!
I don't want twins.

02:10.321 --> 02:12.856
- So I bought these tickets

02:12.890 --> 02:15.525
For the austin
indie music festival,

02:15.560 --> 02:17.294
And it was supposed
to be a surprise, but--

02:17.328 --> 02:19.196
- Oh, but then my dad died.
- Yeah.

02:19.230 --> 02:21.098
I can give 'em to devin
or something.

02:21.132 --> 02:23.467
- No, no, no, no, no.
We ought to go.

02:23.501 --> 02:25.068
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.037
And you know what?

02:27.071 --> 02:29.773
Actually someone gave me, like,
this grieving handbook thing,

02:29.807 --> 02:32.008
And chapter two said,
"when your dad dies,

02:32.043 --> 02:33.877
"you should most
likely probably go

02:33.911 --> 02:36.747
To a music festival,
preferably in austin."

02:36.781 --> 02:39.182
- You're such a liar.
- I'm not a liar.

02:39.217 --> 02:41.017
- Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

02:41.052 --> 02:43.186
- I'll be fine.
Look, he's--

02:43.221 --> 02:44.554
He's dead, all right?

02:44.589 --> 02:47.290
And I'm--I'm alive.

02:47.325 --> 02:49.292
So let's go.

02:49.327 --> 02:50.494
- Okay.

02:50.528 --> 02:53.130
- Hey, guys.
How you doing?

02:53.164 --> 02:54.731
Hey, mike. How are you?

02:54.766 --> 02:57.734
- Coach, what are your goals
going into this game?

02:57.769 --> 02:59.035
- Goals going into the game?

02:59.070 --> 03:00.303
Well, we'd like
to stop their offense

03:00.338 --> 03:01.738
And put a few holes
in their defense.

03:01.773 --> 03:03.607
- How do you intend to measure
your success in doing that?

03:03.641 --> 03:05.142
- Well, we're gonna use
the scoreboard

03:05.176 --> 03:06.910
To measure that success.

03:06.944 --> 03:08.278
- What do you hope
to accomplish there?

03:08.312 --> 03:10.514
I mean, what do you want
the score to reflect?

03:10.548 --> 03:12.749
- I would like
for the score to reflect

03:12.784 --> 03:14.918
That we left everything
on the field that we had.

03:14.952 --> 03:16.420
- So are you saying you're
gonna win this game, coach?

03:16.454 --> 03:18.021
- Well, what I'm saying is--

03:18.055 --> 03:19.689
- We can win
and we will win.

03:19.724 --> 03:21.324
- Are you guaranteeing
a victory?

03:21.359 --> 03:23.026
- I am guaranteeing a victory.

03:23.060 --> 03:24.961
We got to start practice,
okay?

03:24.996 --> 03:26.096
- Good. Let's do this.

03:26.130 --> 03:27.431
- Get these fine young
men out here

03:27.465 --> 03:29.132
Who are gonna be putting
their blood on the field!

03:29.167 --> 03:30.700
[knock on door]

03:30.735 --> 03:34.037
Becky, come on.

03:42.213 --> 03:43.980
- Hey.

03:44.015 --> 03:48.084
- Hey.

03:48.119 --> 03:50.187
Nice place.

03:50.221 --> 03:53.056
- Yeah, it's,
um, something.

03:53.090 --> 03:54.758
So I saw you at the funeral.

03:54.792 --> 03:56.760
- Yeah, I saw you too.

03:56.794 --> 03:58.829
- Thought you'd be back
at college by now.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.498
- Midterm break.

04:01.532 --> 04:02.999
I stayed to see my dad.

04:03.034 --> 04:07.437
- Oh.
That's nice.

04:07.472 --> 04:08.839
- "that's nice."
that's it?

04:08.873 --> 04:12.809
- I mean...
It's not nice?

04:12.844 --> 04:15.312
- [scoffs]

04:15.346 --> 04:17.613
Oh, you are something, huh?

04:17.648 --> 04:20.517
You stop calling.
You disappear.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.419
That's nice.

04:22.453 --> 04:24.788
My dad says you threw away
the scholarship.

04:24.822 --> 04:26.356
- Mm-hmm.

04:26.390 --> 04:30.594
Yeah, I did.

04:30.628 --> 04:32.963
- Wow.

04:32.997 --> 04:36.833
I am--
I'm so glad I came over.

05:36.627 --> 05:37.794
- No, no, no.
- Mom!

05:37.828 --> 05:39.329
It's two days.
It's not a week.

05:39.363 --> 05:41.998
- It is two nights
in austin during exams.

05:42.033 --> 05:44.267
Absolutely not.
It's a ridiculous thing.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.535
You haven't even been
accepted into college yet.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.137
- So if I would have gotten
into college,

05:47.171 --> 05:49.072
This would be a completely
conversation because...

05:49.106 --> 05:50.340
- If you had passed
your exams already

05:50.374 --> 05:52.309
And you had gotten accepted
into three schools

05:52.343 --> 05:54.878
Early decision then, yes,
you can go to austin, texas,

05:54.912 --> 05:57.581
On two school nights
and enjoy a music show.

05:57.615 --> 06:00.417
Yes, I think in that situation,
I'd be all right with it.

06:00.451 --> 06:02.586
- Matt's dad just died, mom.

06:02.620 --> 06:05.322
- I'm not gonna dignify
that with even a response.

06:05.356 --> 06:06.656
Come on, jules.

06:06.691 --> 06:08.224
- What's going on?

06:08.259 --> 06:10.894
- Dad, can I go to the music
festival with matt?

06:10.928 --> 06:12.629
- Hi, sweet girl--
the music festival

06:12.663 --> 06:15.599
In the middle of the week
in austin, texas, sweetheart.

06:15.633 --> 06:17.500
- No, I don't think you're gonna
be going to austin with matt.

06:17.535 --> 06:20.170
- You guys are awful!

06:20.204 --> 06:22.973
- Oh.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.541
Look, matt, I'm sorry.

06:24.575 --> 06:26.076
- You should be, man.
You suck.

06:26.110 --> 06:27.544
I been working
with you a lot lately--

06:27.578 --> 06:29.012
- That is not at all
what I was talking about.

06:29.046 --> 06:30.380
I was talking about your dad,
so thanks.

06:30.414 --> 06:32.082
- I know. I know.

06:32.116 --> 06:33.750
You know they--

06:33.784 --> 06:35.785
They're giving us,
like, a death gratuity.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.654
- A what?
Death gratuity?

06:37.688 --> 06:39.789
- Yeah, it's, like, $100,000.

06:39.824 --> 06:41.491
- Does it come in a tip jar?

06:41.525 --> 06:43.526
- No.
They just--

06:43.561 --> 06:47.230
I guess they tack it on with
the life insurance policies,

06:47.264 --> 06:48.765
So grandma's--

06:48.799 --> 06:50.266
You know, she's just set up
for the rest of her life.

06:50.301 --> 06:53.737
- Well, that's good.
What about you?

06:53.771 --> 06:58.241
- What about me?

06:58.275 --> 06:59.476
- I don't know.

06:59.510 --> 07:01.177
How are you doing,
I guess?

07:01.212 --> 07:02.212
- I'm fine, man.

07:02.246 --> 07:03.213
I don't understand
why people keep

07:03.247 --> 07:04.214
Asking me how I'm doing.

07:04.248 --> 07:05.215
I'm fine.

07:05.249 --> 07:06.383
People just keep saying,
"are you okay?"

07:06.417 --> 07:07.384
- Well, matt,
I don't really know

07:07.418 --> 07:08.451
What to say
in this situation.

07:08.486 --> 07:09.686
- Well, then don't say--

07:09.720 --> 07:10.854
You don't have
to say anything, all right?

07:10.888 --> 07:12.155
It's over with.
We took care of all that,

07:12.189 --> 07:13.356
And now we're just
throwing a football.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.858
Is that okay?
Is that okay with you?

07:14.892 --> 07:16.192
- I'm really start
to get the feeling

07:16.227 --> 07:17.727
That you just want
to fight.

07:17.762 --> 07:18.895
I don't know if you
want me to give you

07:18.929 --> 07:21.197
Some kind of big, uh, speech.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.067
I don't know what it is
that you want me to do.

07:24.101 --> 07:25.335
But I'm not gonna do that.

07:25.369 --> 07:26.670
I don't care what you do.

07:26.704 --> 07:29.839
But either way, I'm gonna
be your best friend,

07:29.874 --> 07:33.376
'cause you've been my best
friend since we were five.

07:33.411 --> 07:38.014
- Yeah, all right.

07:38.049 --> 07:39.683
- Hey, honey.

07:39.717 --> 07:41.084
Hey, y'all.

07:41.118 --> 07:42.686
Oh, messages, messages?

07:42.720 --> 07:44.020
- Of course.
Of course.

07:44.055 --> 07:47.290
The pta meeting has been changed
to Friday the 28th.

07:47.324 --> 07:48.725
Clint wants you
to meet the new hire

07:48.759 --> 07:50.994
For ap spanish,
and mrs. Corrigan called

07:51.028 --> 07:52.996
To request that her son
be moved out of calculus.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.064
- Oh, goodness.
- Her number's here--

07:54.098 --> 07:55.765
- Okay, thank you so much.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.600
- Oh, and your daughter
called and she said

07:57.635 --> 07:58.868
For you not to worry
about anything.

07:58.903 --> 08:00.103
She'd see you on Saturday.

08:00.137 --> 08:02.806
- Wait.
What was that?

08:02.840 --> 08:03.873
- Yeah, she said--

08:03.908 --> 08:05.508
She said she was going
to austin.

08:05.543 --> 08:06.576
- She did?

08:06.610 --> 08:08.411
- Called 15 minutes ago,
maybe.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.846
- All right.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.347
Could you just, um,
get that door?

08:11.382 --> 08:15.318
Thank you very much.

08:15.352 --> 08:17.887
Julie, this is your
mother calling.

08:17.922 --> 08:19.189
I just got
the strangest message

08:19.223 --> 08:21.057
From the secretary
in the office

08:21.092 --> 08:23.026
That you have gone
to austin,

08:23.060 --> 08:24.594
Which I know cannot
be true,

08:24.628 --> 08:26.529
Considering the fact that both
your father and I told you

08:26.564 --> 08:27.897
That you could not go
to austin.

08:27.932 --> 08:29.332
So you had best
call me back right away.

08:29.366 --> 08:31.935
Thank you very much.

08:37.775 --> 08:39.676
- Hello, stranger.

08:39.710 --> 08:41.510
- So look, I think--
I think the best thing

08:41.544 --> 08:44.214
To do here in this situation
is just completely mature

08:44.248 --> 08:45.715
About all this.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.150
- Uh-huh?
- You know?

08:47.184 --> 08:49.452
And first off,
I just want to say

08:49.487 --> 08:52.889
Kissing you was great.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.390
You know?

08:54.425 --> 08:56.392
Um, you're--that was great.
You're great.

08:56.427 --> 08:58.795
So just know that
bottom line, you know?

08:58.829 --> 09:00.263
- Uh-huh?

09:00.297 --> 09:02.899
- Well, you see,
there's this part of me

09:02.933 --> 09:04.467
That's like,
maybe we should just kind of

09:04.502 --> 09:06.002
See where it goes,
see what happens,

09:06.036 --> 09:07.804
Not really think
about it too much.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.405
Then there's
this other really, really

09:09.440 --> 09:11.474
Kind of tiny part
of me

09:11.509 --> 09:15.645
That's still hung up
on this other girl tyra,

09:15.679 --> 09:19.749
Who's, like, embedded
in the back of my mind,

09:19.784 --> 09:23.086
So I think
the mature thing--

09:27.057 --> 09:30.126
I really didn't
see that coming.

09:34.131 --> 09:36.800
- Will I see you later?

09:36.834 --> 09:38.168
- Like when?

09:38.202 --> 09:39.769
- Five minutes.

09:39.804 --> 09:44.841
Maybe three.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.709
- I go back to school
in three days.

09:46.744 --> 09:48.678
- You go back to school
in three days.

09:48.712 --> 09:50.446
See, I don't know
if you know this,

09:50.481 --> 09:52.882
But I'm kind of a
moment-to-moment kind of guy,

09:52.917 --> 09:55.118
So three days...
- Uh-huh?

09:55.152 --> 09:56.352
- I can work with that.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.854
- What's that mean exactly?

09:57.888 --> 09:59.355
That you can
"work with that?"

09:59.390 --> 10:01.591
- No.

10:01.625 --> 10:04.394
I could probably tell you,
but...

10:04.428 --> 10:05.995
- I'm dying to know.

10:06.030 --> 10:08.798
[laughter]
- showing you might be
even better.

10:08.833 --> 10:11.334
I can show you what it means
to work with it.

10:11.368 --> 10:13.703
[laughter and indistinct
chatter]

10:13.737 --> 10:15.271
- Ow!
- They're sharp, I know.

10:15.306 --> 10:17.640
- [chuckles]

10:17.675 --> 10:19.275
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

10:19.310 --> 10:22.378
- Good.
I'll miss you.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.047
[knock on door]

10:24.081 --> 10:25.782
- Tim riggins!

10:25.816 --> 10:27.217
Okay, look,
I know you're inhere.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.751
- Just 'cause there's
a girl at my door,

10:28.786 --> 10:31.788
I don't have a girlfriend.

10:31.822 --> 10:33.690
- Okay, you're not ignoring me,
right?

10:33.724 --> 10:35.191
Because I just want
to let you know that

10:35.226 --> 10:37.460
I'm not gonna jump on you every
time I see you or anything.

10:37.494 --> 10:42.732
- Yeah, hi.
- Oh, hey.

10:42.766 --> 10:47.570
- Lyla, becky.
Becky, lyla.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.339
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:49.373 --> 10:51.441
- Yeah, I was just gonna ask
for a ride to school,

10:51.475 --> 10:52.709
But it's cool.

10:52.743 --> 10:54.244
I know you're busy.
- Okay.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.279
- I'll see you later.

10:58.949 --> 11:04.053
- That was, um,
the landlord's daughter.

11:04.088 --> 11:05.088
- Mm-hmm.

11:08.859 --> 11:10.159
- How are you gonna play
this Friday night?

11:10.194 --> 11:11.160
- We've been through the storm.

11:11.195 --> 11:12.161
We've been through the rain.

11:12.196 --> 11:13.363
Now we fixing
to bring the pain.

11:13.397 --> 11:15.064
- Well, emily, I think,
you know,

11:15.099 --> 11:17.967
I scored a perfect score
on my math portion of the s.A.T.

11:18.002 --> 11:19.969
So, you know,
if the pressure's on,

11:20.004 --> 11:22.972
I think I'm the guy
to go to, emily.

11:23.007 --> 11:24.707
- Do you have anything more
to say about

11:24.742 --> 11:28.077
That guaranteed win?

11:28.112 --> 11:32.081
- Well, I'm more of the brains
and brawn, you know?

11:32.116 --> 11:33.583
I got it all.
I'm the total package, baby.

11:33.617 --> 11:34.584
- Are you gonna win?

11:34.618 --> 11:40.456
- [laughs]

11:40.491 --> 11:42.825
- Coach, could we talk about
your history of quitting,

11:42.860 --> 11:44.928
First with the panthers
back in '06,

11:44.962 --> 11:47.530
And more recently,
forfeiting your first game

11:47.564 --> 11:49.165
As head coach of the lions?

11:49.199 --> 11:50.700
- Don't know why you
come out here

11:50.734 --> 11:52.302
And waste people's time
with this.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.540
- This is romantic.

11:57.574 --> 11:59.208
Nice breeze.
It's perfect.

11:59.243 --> 12:01.945
- Mmm.
Good sandwiches.

12:01.979 --> 12:04.647
- Good sandwiches that I put
my heart and soul into.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.082
- [chuckles]

12:06.116 --> 12:07.917
- It's hard making
peanut butters.

12:07.952 --> 12:13.289
[cell phone vibrates]
your phone's ringing.

12:13.324 --> 12:15.124
- It's just devin.

12:15.159 --> 12:16.559
I'll call her back later.

12:16.593 --> 12:18.428
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

12:18.462 --> 12:20.530
We're having our romantic picnic
right now, okay?

12:20.564 --> 12:21.998
- Yeah, that's right.

12:22.032 --> 12:25.134
- Uh-uh. Wait.

12:25.169 --> 12:26.202
- Excuse me, miss.

12:26.236 --> 12:30.907
Can I get some service,
please?

12:30.941 --> 12:34.110
Excuse me, miss?

12:34.144 --> 12:36.279
Can I get some menus over here
and some service?

12:40.284 --> 12:41.884
Thank you.

12:41.919 --> 12:43.586
- I'm sorry.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.455
Okay, vince, you really need
to go away.

12:45.489 --> 12:46.823
- I can't get some food?
- No.

12:46.857 --> 12:48.257
It don't make no sense
you being here.

12:48.292 --> 12:49.559
- Why not?

12:49.593 --> 12:51.394
You know your dad got
the best ribs in town.

12:51.428 --> 12:53.963
- What you want?

12:53.998 --> 12:55.631
- Hey, mr. Merriweather.

12:55.666 --> 12:57.934
I was just talking
to your daughter jess.

12:57.968 --> 12:59.602
About to order some
of them baby back ribs.

12:59.636 --> 13:00.937
- Mm-hmm?

13:00.971 --> 13:02.372
Well, you can get that over
at the counter to go.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.074
- No, that's cool.
I was gon' sit here and eat it.

13:05.109 --> 13:07.877
- Get your ass over
to the counter.

13:07.911 --> 13:11.447
- Yes, sir.

13:11.482 --> 13:12.582
Here.

13:12.616 --> 13:13.750
It was a pleasure talking
to you, jess.

13:13.784 --> 13:16.085
I'll see you around school.

13:20.858 --> 13:25.228
- Hey, it's the girl
who loves her candy.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.463
Got you some gummy bears.

13:27.498 --> 13:29.866
- Okay, look...

13:29.900 --> 13:32.068
Our little thing
the other night,

13:32.102 --> 13:33.870
That was a mistake,
okay?

13:33.904 --> 13:35.638
That was a big mistake.

13:35.672 --> 13:37.340
And I would really
appreciate it

13:37.374 --> 13:39.642
If you didn't try to treat me
like a girlfriend or anything,

13:39.676 --> 13:41.144
And I don't need you
buying me stuff.

13:41.178 --> 13:42.712
I don't want anything
from you.

13:42.746 --> 13:43.980
Especially not for you
to talk about me

13:44.014 --> 13:45.281
To your little
football buddies.

13:45.315 --> 13:47.683
- I didn't say anything
to my football buddies.

13:47.718 --> 13:49.852
- Yeah, I'll bet you didn't.

13:49.887 --> 13:51.187
Just forget it.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.456
We just don't have to talk
at all anymore, okay?

13:53.490 --> 13:54.690
- Sorry.
I just--

13:54.725 --> 13:56.159
I think you're cute
and I just

13:56.193 --> 13:59.662
Would really love to go
out again sometime, but...

13:59.696 --> 14:00.863
I must be, uh--

14:00.898 --> 14:02.498
Yeah.
I don't know.

14:02.533 --> 14:07.503
Sorry.

14:07.538 --> 14:08.938
- [scoffs]

14:08.972 --> 14:11.674
- Julie, I know that
you probably do not

14:11.708 --> 14:13.376
Think this is a big deal,
but I assure you

14:13.410 --> 14:14.877
This is a gigantic deal.

14:14.912 --> 14:17.213
You had best turn around from
wherever you are right now

14:17.247 --> 14:19.882
And get yourself home,
and you answer the phone

14:19.917 --> 14:22.685
When I call you!

14:22.719 --> 14:23.786
[sighs]

14:23.821 --> 14:27.190
You are my favorite daughter.

14:27.224 --> 14:29.225
Be right back, sweetie.

14:33.730 --> 14:35.465
- Five, six, seven, eight.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.666
Wait, no.
You know what?

14:36.700 --> 14:37.700
I think we should go--
because that would add--

14:37.734 --> 14:39.235
- Jess.
Jess.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.870
No, come on.
Seriously, it's fine.

14:40.904 --> 14:42.505
- Is fine okay for tv?

14:42.539 --> 14:44.006
'cause if y'all okay
with fine,

14:44.041 --> 14:45.241
Then we can stop right now.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.676
Come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.978
All right, five, six,
seven, eight.

14:49.012 --> 14:52.415
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

14:52.449 --> 14:53.916
- Three, two, one.
[whistle blows]

14:53.951 --> 14:55.651
- Bring it in, guys.
Let's go.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.920
[applause]
here we go, here we go.

14:57.955 --> 14:58.988
- Hey, listen up.

14:59.022 --> 15:00.456
Who can tell me
mcnulty's record?

15:00.491 --> 15:01.691
- Yeah, coach,
they never lost.

15:01.725 --> 15:02.692
- That's right.
They haven't.

15:02.726 --> 15:04.060
But we're gonna
change that,

15:04.094 --> 15:05.228
And here's how we're gonna
do it, gentlemen.

15:05.262 --> 15:07.597
We're gonna play 11
on offense today,

15:07.631 --> 15:09.432
But we are gonna
do 13 on defense,

15:09.466 --> 15:12.034
Because if you can punch
one hole into 13,

15:12.069 --> 15:13.870
You damn well ought
to be able to punch

15:13.904 --> 15:15.071
2 holes into 11.

15:15.105 --> 15:16.873
Understood?

15:16.907 --> 15:18.374
All: Yes, sir.

15:18.408 --> 15:20.510
- We got tim and billy
coming over to help.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.744
- Ah, here we go.

15:21.778 --> 15:24.180
- You boys ever play
a couple state champions?

15:24.214 --> 15:25.515
- Here we go!

15:25.549 --> 15:27.016
- Show 'em your ring, tim.

15:27.050 --> 15:28.284
- All the guys in yellow
on defense,

15:28.318 --> 15:29.452
Over there,
huddle 'em up.

15:29.486 --> 15:31.387
Over here, offense.
- Let's go, boys!

15:31.421 --> 15:32.455
Here we go!

15:32.489 --> 15:33.656
Feel good!

15:33.690 --> 15:35.591
We feel good!

15:35.626 --> 15:37.093
How you guys feel?

15:37.127 --> 15:38.394
- Let's go!
- Here we go!

15:38.428 --> 15:39.829
Here we go!
Let's go!

15:39.863 --> 15:41.130
Let's go, d!

15:41.165 --> 15:44.100
- Strong red, strong red,
strong red!

15:46.403 --> 15:48.938
[grunting, yelling]

15:48.972 --> 15:50.139
- [grunting]

15:50.174 --> 15:52.041
[applause]

15:52.075 --> 15:54.010
- [groans]
- you was open on that one?

15:54.044 --> 15:55.711
- I got hit before
I even got the ball.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.079
- Guy's all over the place.

15:57.114 --> 15:58.447
So fast.

15:58.482 --> 16:00.583
- All right,
let's do it.

16:00.617 --> 16:02.752
- Let's go.

16:06.290 --> 16:07.390
Oh!

16:07.424 --> 16:09.792
[cheering]
- yeah!

16:09.826 --> 16:11.294
- It's like playing against
a brick wall over here.

16:11.328 --> 16:12.361
Come on.
- I know.

16:12.396 --> 16:13.596
I can feel it.

16:13.630 --> 16:14.797
- We're not ready for this.

16:14.831 --> 16:16.532
- Here we go.

16:18.669 --> 16:19.969
- Here we go.
Come on, come on, come on.

16:20.003 --> 16:22.772
- Go, go, go, go.

16:22.806 --> 16:24.574
Go, go, go, go.
Aww!

16:24.608 --> 16:26.375
Copeland, you got
to respond to that!

16:26.410 --> 16:28.110
- They're getting there.

16:28.145 --> 16:29.445
They're getting there.
- Touch down!

16:29.479 --> 16:30.580
- Love it, love it.

16:30.614 --> 16:38.254
âª âª

16:38.288 --> 16:40.323
- âª you've got a way âª

16:40.357 --> 16:42.291
âª to make my heart sing âª

16:42.326 --> 16:44.160
- Seriously, I mean,
I'm telling you right now,

16:44.194 --> 16:47.096
If we had to play a game
tomorrow, I would be a madman.

16:47.130 --> 16:49.298
- Okay, so here's what I want.
- Honestly I was running--

16:49.333 --> 16:50.833
- I want you guys to just stop
talking about football.

16:50.867 --> 16:52.335
- How's being pregnant?

16:52.369 --> 16:53.936
- Oh, it's great, you know?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.137
I mean, she just thinks her
water's gonna break,

16:55.172 --> 16:56.138
Like, every 15 minutes,
but--

16:56.173 --> 16:58.107
- Really?
I mean, I know

16:58.141 --> 17:00.309
You have the belly,
but not the baby,

17:00.344 --> 17:01.877
'cause she asked me what it was
like to be pregnant.

17:01.912 --> 17:03.646
What you could do is you
could just thank me

17:03.680 --> 17:04.946
For always being
your designated driver.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.282
- I do.
I thank you constantly.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.651
I thank you constantly, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

17:08.685 --> 17:10.219
- 'cause I love you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:10.253 --> 17:11.220
- It's true.

17:11.255 --> 17:13.021
What?

17:13.056 --> 17:15.124
- Y'all know what I miss?
- What?

17:15.157 --> 17:17.560
- Getting on that bull
and letting off some steam.

17:17.594 --> 17:18.594
- I'd ride that bull.

17:18.628 --> 17:19.762
- No, you shouldn't.

17:19.796 --> 17:20.796
- I would ride that bull.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.498
- Hey, lyla, not a good call.

17:22.531 --> 17:23.566
- It's totally a good call.

17:23.599 --> 17:24.800
- No, it's not a good call.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.167
Don't get on the death ride.

17:26.203 --> 17:27.403
- I'm riding the bull.

17:27.436 --> 17:28.537
- Yeah, you're riding the bull.

17:28.571 --> 17:30.239
[laughs]

17:30.274 --> 17:31.774
- What'd you just do?

17:31.808 --> 17:32.775
- Amazing.

17:32.809 --> 17:34.010
- Can I go next?

17:34.044 --> 17:35.311
- Sure, little lady.

17:35.345 --> 17:38.080
- This might not end well.

17:38.115 --> 17:40.883
- Oh, my god.

17:40.917 --> 17:42.518
- Whoo!
I'm ready!

17:46.790 --> 17:48.024
- Whoa!

17:48.058 --> 17:50.192
She's pretty good.

17:50.227 --> 17:52.628
- Ow!

17:52.663 --> 17:54.563
Whoo!

17:58.735 --> 18:02.738
[laughs]

18:05.242 --> 18:06.309
- That's very smooth.

18:06.343 --> 18:08.544
- You missed me.

18:08.578 --> 18:10.579
- You have no idea.

18:18.622 --> 18:19.822
- Ll see you later.
- All right, buddy.

18:19.856 --> 18:21.390
- Landry!
- Bye.

18:21.425 --> 18:22.825
- Hey, landry.
- Hey.

18:22.859 --> 18:23.959
- How are you doing?

18:23.994 --> 18:25.861
- I'm doing good.
- Good to see you.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.596
- Good to see you over here
at east dillon.

18:27.631 --> 18:28.931
- I know.

18:28.965 --> 18:31.133
Well, you know, I had to drop
off something for coach.

18:31.168 --> 18:32.868
Rushing off to my school.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.570
- Right.

18:34.604 --> 18:36.505
- Hey, have you talked
to matt and jules

18:36.540 --> 18:39.141
Since they've gone off
on their big trip to austin?

18:39.176 --> 18:40.943
- No, not since they left.

18:40.977 --> 18:42.078
- Yeah.
- What?

18:42.112 --> 18:43.479
- Listen, I'm just
gonna be

18:43.513 --> 18:45.748
Real straightforward
with you, landry.

18:45.782 --> 18:48.017
My daughter's awol
and I'm sick about it,

18:48.051 --> 18:50.686
And if you could shed
any light on where they are

18:50.721 --> 18:52.722
And when they're gonna be there,
anything like that,

18:52.756 --> 18:55.191
It would just be real--
real helpful to me.

18:55.225 --> 18:56.726
- Well, I mean,
I don't know.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.260
Obviously I don't know
their whole schedule...

18:58.295 --> 18:59.729
- You know, I--
well, just--

18:59.763 --> 19:02.698
- I think they were planning on
seeing the heartless bastards

19:02.733 --> 19:04.300
At emo's tomorrow night.

19:04.334 --> 19:05.668
- Okay, that's good to--

19:05.702 --> 19:06.969
- Like 7:30 or 8:00
or something.

19:07.003 --> 19:08.471
But other than that, I don't--
- uh-huh.

19:08.505 --> 19:09.805
And you know where
they're staying

19:09.840 --> 19:11.207
Or anything like that?

19:11.241 --> 19:13.042
- Are you going?
Are you gonna go visit?

19:13.076 --> 19:15.144
- No.
I don't--no.

19:15.178 --> 19:17.179
But I just--I'm a mother.

19:17.214 --> 19:19.382
Um, all right, well,
I got to--

19:19.416 --> 19:21.150
I'll have to get over
to my school now, but--

19:21.184 --> 19:22.885
- Okay, well, it's--
- nice to see you.

19:22.919 --> 19:24.320
- It was good to see you.
- Okay.

19:24.354 --> 19:25.488
Thank you.

19:36.299 --> 19:38.701
- Hi.
Becky, right?

19:38.735 --> 19:39.935
- Yeah.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.303
- I'm lyla.

19:41.338 --> 19:42.505
- Yeah, I remember.

19:42.539 --> 19:44.006
- Is tim around?

19:44.040 --> 19:45.975
- Oh, no.
I, um--I haven't seen him.

19:46.009 --> 19:48.477
- Okay.

19:48.512 --> 19:50.513
- So you're in college,
right?

19:50.547 --> 19:52.481
Is it great?

19:52.516 --> 19:53.716
- Yeah.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.818
It's pretty cool.

19:55.852 --> 19:57.386
Guess I've been a little
homesick lately.

19:57.421 --> 20:00.122
- For dillon?

20:00.157 --> 20:02.291
- Yeah, I didn't expect
that either.

20:02.325 --> 20:03.993
- Did you come back
'cause you miss tim?

20:04.027 --> 20:08.364
- No.

20:08.398 --> 20:11.734
You know, I really don't know
what I'm doing here.

20:11.768 --> 20:17.306
Um, you go away
to college and, uh...

20:17.340 --> 20:19.341
You think you're getting over
the whole thing,

20:19.376 --> 20:21.977
'cause being away helps
with that.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.247
But...

20:25.282 --> 20:29.485
Now I'm here
and here we are.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.187
- I'll tell tim
you stopped by.

20:35.091 --> 20:38.527
You're so lucky.

20:38.562 --> 20:40.563
So pretty.

20:50.407 --> 20:51.841
- This is the mcnulty film.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.108
I want y'all to watch
this together.

20:53.143 --> 20:54.343
You understand?
- Yes, sir.

20:54.377 --> 20:57.413
- All right, good enough.

20:57.447 --> 20:58.747
Anything confusing about that?

20:58.782 --> 20:59.949
- Where?

20:59.983 --> 21:01.684
- Wherever you can find
out to watch 'em.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.587
Would you step out of my way
so I can see the tv, please?

21:04.621 --> 21:08.691
- Okay.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.393
Why do we have
to get killed on tv?

21:11.428 --> 21:12.595
- I don't know.

21:12.629 --> 21:13.696
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

21:13.730 --> 21:17.766
- Gotta do something.

21:17.801 --> 21:19.768
- Oh.

21:19.803 --> 21:21.470
Look who it is.

21:21.505 --> 21:22.738
- Look who it is.

21:22.772 --> 21:24.073
- What are you guys doing?

21:24.107 --> 21:25.574
- [indistinct]

21:25.609 --> 21:27.877
- Watching game tape?
- What's it look like, genius?

21:27.911 --> 21:30.746
- In sears?
- Funny.

21:30.780 --> 21:32.815
- Yeah, I'm surprised you
haven't stolen one of these.

21:32.849 --> 21:35.751
- Dude, shut up.

21:35.785 --> 21:36.886
- Got a problem?

21:36.920 --> 21:40.823
- Nah, but I can get one
real quick.

21:40.857 --> 21:42.791
- Can I help you boys?

21:42.826 --> 21:44.360
- Yeah.
- You know what?

21:44.394 --> 21:45.694
Why don't you get the hell out
of my department

21:45.729 --> 21:46.862
And the hell out
of my store?

21:46.897 --> 21:48.097
- For what?

21:48.131 --> 21:49.498
- 'cause I'm just
one jackass comment

21:49.533 --> 21:51.233
Away from doing
some serious damage,

21:51.268 --> 21:54.703
And if that happens,
I would lose my job...

21:54.738 --> 21:56.438
And I love my job.

21:56.473 --> 21:58.474
You get me?

21:58.508 --> 21:59.708
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

21:59.743 --> 22:01.710
- Let's go, man.

22:01.745 --> 22:04.346
- Yeah.

22:04.381 --> 22:05.581
- From the east side.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.917
Coach, I didn't even know.
What's up?

22:07.951 --> 22:09.351
- Down.
[laughter]

22:09.386 --> 22:11.287
Look for the gaps.
- Okay.

22:11.321 --> 22:13.255
- Yes, sir.

22:14.858 --> 22:16.859
- [groans]

22:16.893 --> 22:18.193
- Matt, get off the bedspread.

22:18.228 --> 22:19.628
- What?
- They don't wash it.

22:19.663 --> 22:20.763
There's, like,
bugs that live in it.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.064
Get off, off, off,
off, off, off, off.

22:22.098 --> 22:23.432
- Okay, sorry, sorry.

22:23.466 --> 22:25.701
- It's getting--get some
kind of disease.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.136
- Jesus.

22:27.170 --> 22:28.804
- There.
Now you can sit down.

22:28.838 --> 22:31.707
[radio plays]

22:31.741 --> 22:33.842
- Would you like to dance?

22:33.877 --> 22:35.778
- Are you being serious?

22:35.812 --> 22:40.416
- Yeah, it's pretty music.

22:40.450 --> 22:42.151
- Wow. Mr. Romance.

22:42.185 --> 22:44.153
- Shut up.
Stop ruining the moment.

22:44.187 --> 22:45.487
- I am not ruining the moment.

22:45.522 --> 22:47.756
- Shut up and enjoy it.

22:47.791 --> 22:52.528
- We're in a hotel dancing.

22:52.562 --> 22:53.596
- Whoo.

22:53.630 --> 22:55.464
- This is real romantical.

22:55.498 --> 22:56.565
- Yeah and it's beautiful.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.100
Look, we're in austin.

22:58.134 --> 23:00.135
- It's the capital.

23:07.377 --> 23:09.878
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:14.451 --> 23:17.419
Thanks for coming back.

23:20.590 --> 23:23.225
- You're welcome.

23:28.732 --> 23:31.767
- Now I can't believe
my son

23:31.801 --> 23:33.969
Gon' be on tv.

23:34.004 --> 23:37.506
- Yeah, your son's gon' get his
butt whooped on tv too.

23:37.540 --> 23:41.310
- Man, you don't know that.

23:41.344 --> 23:45.614
Oh, I got to find something
to wear.

23:45.649 --> 23:47.149
- Wear for what?

23:47.183 --> 23:49.151
- To the game.

23:49.185 --> 23:50.319
- You don't got
to come all the way up

23:50.353 --> 23:52.521
To mcnulty just
to see me lose.

23:52.555 --> 23:55.157
- Well, um...

23:55.191 --> 23:58.394
Selena said she'd drop me off.

23:58.428 --> 24:02.131
Look, I need to see you play.

24:02.165 --> 24:04.166
- [quietly scoffs]

24:04.200 --> 24:05.234
- I do.

24:05.268 --> 24:08.537
- Okay.

24:08.571 --> 24:10.539
- Look, I won't--

24:10.573 --> 24:12.675
I won't make no scenes
or nothing.

24:12.709 --> 24:14.977
You know, I'll be cleaned up.

24:15.011 --> 24:17.746
- I'm going
to austin tomorrow.

24:17.781 --> 24:19.481
- You're what?

24:19.516 --> 24:21.450
- I'm going to find our daughter
in austin tomorrow.

24:21.484 --> 24:22.785
- Now listen, babe--

24:22.819 --> 24:25.054
- Because I don't care
that she is 17 years old.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.955
She bald-faced lied to us

24:26.990 --> 24:28.757
And she went there
without our permission.

24:28.792 --> 24:30.025
We told her not to go.

24:30.060 --> 24:32.127
We expressly said,
"do not go to austin,"

24:32.162 --> 24:34.396
And she went off
without telling us.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.899
Even though we told her not
to go, she's there.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.634
- You can't go down--find her
in a music festival.

24:38.668 --> 24:40.936
- She's not answered one
single one of my phone calls.

24:40.970 --> 24:42.738
I have no idea where she is.

24:42.772 --> 24:44.473
She has not called us.

24:44.507 --> 24:46.141
She could be--

24:46.176 --> 24:48.777
I have no idea if she's okay.

24:48.812 --> 24:50.212
I am concerned.

24:50.246 --> 24:53.248
I can't think
of another thing right now.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.517
Can't focus on anything,
so I'm just gonna

24:55.552 --> 24:57.286
Go to austin
and I'm going to find her.

25:01.858 --> 25:04.026
- And I support
your decision 100%.

25:04.060 --> 25:07.129
- Thank you, babe.

25:07.163 --> 25:09.798
It's so darn selfish.

25:09.833 --> 25:11.967
- But more importantly--

25:12.001 --> 25:13.302
More importantly,
riggins rigs--

25:13.336 --> 25:15.037
Yeah, granted,
it's not doing so well.

25:15.071 --> 25:16.105
I understand that.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.473
Hence me in the trailer
right now.

25:17.507 --> 25:18.640
That will change.

25:18.675 --> 25:22.411
So give me six months,
a year.

25:22.445 --> 25:23.979
He's got his kid and
all this kind of stuff.

25:24.013 --> 25:25.047
It's gonna get busy.

25:25.081 --> 25:26.615
I'm pitching away,
doing my thing.

25:26.649 --> 25:28.283
Handing out cards.
All this kind of stuff.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.651
It's gonna get super busy.

25:29.686 --> 25:31.086
I'll be under that car
all the time.

25:31.121 --> 25:34.189
That's where you come in,
miss garrity.

25:34.224 --> 25:36.024
We're gonna need someone
to manage it

25:36.059 --> 25:38.861
When it gets, like,
just super busy.

25:38.895 --> 25:40.729
I mean, granted, yeah,
it's a simple life,

25:40.764 --> 25:42.531
But, I mean, that--
it's kind of a great life.

25:42.565 --> 25:43.632
- That's your pitch?

25:43.666 --> 25:45.000
- Yeah.

25:45.034 --> 25:46.869
- Wow.
- Yeah.

25:46.903 --> 25:49.438
Take that.
- [chuckles]

25:49.472 --> 25:51.006
That's a hard one
to walk away from.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.542
- So don't.

25:53.576 --> 25:56.812
- Tim--
- I'm serious.

26:03.553 --> 26:05.053
- What do you want?

26:05.088 --> 26:06.588
- You.

26:17.167 --> 26:18.767
- What else do you want?

26:24.174 --> 26:26.175
- You.

26:44.794 --> 26:46.662
- [sobbing]

26:51.534 --> 26:53.001
- Hey, what's wrong?

26:53.036 --> 26:54.736
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:54.771 --> 26:57.539
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

26:57.574 --> 26:59.241
- Why would she do that?

26:59.275 --> 27:01.910
Scare us to death like that?

27:01.945 --> 27:04.580
- I trust julie.

27:04.614 --> 27:06.515
I trust matt.

27:06.549 --> 27:09.318
And I know that she's safe
anywhere, all right?

27:09.352 --> 27:11.086
- I don't know that.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.921
I don't know at all
that she's safe.

27:12.956 --> 27:15.891
She has not returned
one single phone call.

27:15.925 --> 27:18.227
I don't know why
she would do that.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.462
- Because she's 17 years old.
That's why.

27:20.496 --> 27:23.966
- Just breaks my heart.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.101
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

27:26.135 --> 27:28.437
[mumbles]

27:28.471 --> 27:30.105
The more we make
her try to stay,

27:30.139 --> 27:31.740
The more she's gonna stray.

27:31.774 --> 27:32.808
You know that.

27:32.842 --> 27:34.042
- I know, but I hate it.

27:34.077 --> 27:37.212
I don't want her to go.

27:37.247 --> 27:41.149
But I know
she's gonna go and...

27:41.184 --> 27:44.586
I don't want her to.

27:44.621 --> 27:47.589
- You're not going then?

27:47.624 --> 27:48.857
- To austin?

27:48.892 --> 27:51.426
- Mm-hmm.

27:51.461 --> 27:54.396
- No.

27:54.430 --> 27:56.665
Seems kind of silly,
I guess.

27:56.699 --> 27:59.301
I'm just gonna beat her ass
when she gets home.

28:02.739 --> 28:07.776
- Mm.
[cell phone rings]

28:07.810 --> 28:08.844
- Hello?

28:08.878 --> 28:11.613
- Hey, matt.
How you doing?

28:11.648 --> 28:12.648
- Yeah, no, it's good.

28:12.682 --> 28:14.116
Um, we saw him
yesterday

28:14.150 --> 28:16.818
And we're about to go see
the heartless bastards tonight.

28:16.853 --> 28:18.587
- That sounds like
a lot of fun.

28:18.621 --> 28:21.890
Um, just a--kind of a fyi.

28:21.925 --> 28:25.394
Miss taylor kind of cornered me
at school yesterday

28:25.428 --> 28:27.296
And started drilling me
with all these questions

28:27.330 --> 28:29.398
About where you
and julie might be.

28:29.432 --> 28:32.301
- Wait, what?

28:32.335 --> 28:34.069
- And I kind of panicked
and told her

28:34.103 --> 28:36.738
That y'all were going to
the heartless bastards tonight,

28:36.773 --> 28:38.674
Which, now thinking back,
I might not should have done.

28:38.708 --> 28:40.075
- What?

28:40.109 --> 28:41.443
- Just wanted to give you
the heads-up.

28:41.477 --> 28:43.312
It's probably fine.
- Wait, she doesn't know--

28:43.346 --> 28:46.148
- I'm sure she's not gonna come
to austin or anything.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.083
But I just wanted
to let you know.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.618
So there it is.

28:49.652 --> 28:51.486
- So she doesn't know
that she's in austin with me?

28:51.521 --> 28:52.754
- Oh, great.

28:52.789 --> 28:54.456
Well, I think I'm gonna go
'cause I just

28:54.490 --> 28:55.891
Let another cat out
of the bag.

28:55.925 --> 28:57.559
I guess I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

28:57.593 --> 28:59.094
- Thanks.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.963
- Aren't you ready?

29:00.997 --> 29:06.335
- Um...You lied
to your parents?

29:06.369 --> 29:08.704
- I didn't lie
to my parents, matt.

29:08.738 --> 29:10.105
- Okay, well,
'cause that was landry

29:10.139 --> 29:12.441
And he said that your mom was
interrogating landry

29:12.475 --> 29:13.775
About where you were.

29:13.810 --> 29:15.377
- Yeah, well, I told them
I was gonna be in austin.

29:15.411 --> 29:16.712
I left them a message.

29:16.746 --> 29:18.380
- Oh, you left them a message
that you were in austin.

29:18.414 --> 29:19.715
That's good.

29:19.749 --> 29:20.782
- Look, you're blowing it
out of proportion.

29:20.817 --> 29:22.017
It's--matt, it's rlly--

29:22.051 --> 29:23.919
- No, it is a big deal,
'cause you know what?

29:23.953 --> 29:25.420
I actually care what your
parents think about me.

29:25.455 --> 29:26.822
I really don't want them
to hate me,

29:26.856 --> 29:28.123
Which is what's gonna happen
if they think

29:28.157 --> 29:29.558
That I just ran away
to austin with you.

29:29.592 --> 29:31.560
- I told them where I was
gonna be and I'm sorry!

29:31.594 --> 29:33.362
I did this whole thing
to make you happy, okay?

29:33.396 --> 29:35.530
I bought the music festival
tickets so you could get out

29:35.565 --> 29:37.299
Of dillon, because I know
how much you hate dillon.

29:37.333 --> 29:38.600
- I don't--I don't hate dillon.

29:38.634 --> 29:40.535
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.703
- Look, you hate dillon.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.071
You only stay there
because of me

29:43.106 --> 29:44.806
And maybe for once I don't
want the responsibility

29:44.841 --> 29:47.342
Of you having
to stay in dillon.

29:54.083 --> 29:57.419
- Look, hey.
I'm sorry, okay?

29:57.453 --> 30:01.223
I didn't--

30:01.257 --> 30:05.027
I didn't mean--I didn't mean
to freak out.

30:05.061 --> 30:09.398
So let's just go see this
concert, all right?

30:09.432 --> 30:11.733
- I'm sorry too.
I didn't mean to yell.

30:11.768 --> 30:16.438
- No, that's--it's fine.
It's fine.

30:16.472 --> 30:18.473
- Yeah.

30:24.947 --> 30:27.916
[marching band plays]

30:41.264 --> 30:45.467
- Folks, we are just one hour
away from kickoff.

30:45.501 --> 30:48.904
Mcnulty's rolling in
an undefeated, top-ranked team.

30:48.938 --> 30:50.272
Versus the east dillon lions,

30:50.306 --> 30:52.841
A team that has yet
to name a quarterback.

30:52.875 --> 30:55.077
Coach taylor's put this team
together with spit

30:55.111 --> 30:57.779
And scotch tape, and tonight,
this monumental mismatch

30:57.814 --> 31:00.482
Is gonna be captured
on television.

31:00.516 --> 31:02.818
It's a beautiful night
for football, folks.

31:02.852 --> 31:04.553
Vince howard in shotgun.

31:04.587 --> 31:06.321
- Let's go, o!

31:06.355 --> 31:08.123
- Cafferty goes in motion.
There's the snap.

31:08.157 --> 31:09.925
It's a speed sweep,
going left.

31:09.959 --> 31:11.526
Oh! Howard keeps it
going right.

31:11.561 --> 31:13.462
- Got a lane.
This could be something, folks.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.863
Oh, and he trucks
the quarterback.

31:14.897 --> 31:16.198
[cheering]

31:16.232 --> 31:21.636
- First down to the 41.
Roll lions.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.038
- Coach taylor's moving
luke cafferty

31:23.072 --> 31:24.139
Under center for the snap.

31:24.173 --> 31:27.142
It's a little speed draw.

31:27.176 --> 31:29.644
Lanes are up the middle.
Got some room.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.114
Oh, nice run by luke cafferty

31:32.148 --> 31:33.281
The lions, believe it or not,

31:33.316 --> 31:35.150
Got a little something-something
going, folks.

31:35.184 --> 31:36.718
No one saw this coming,

31:36.752 --> 31:42.157
But this could turn out to be
one hell of a football game.

31:46.062 --> 31:47.929
East dillon lions
in the red zone.

31:47.964 --> 31:50.866
This could be big, folks.
Howard at quarterback.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.534
There's the snap.

31:52.568 --> 31:53.635
Howard takes off.

31:53.669 --> 31:55.403
On a little speed draw up
the middle.

31:55.438 --> 31:56.505
Got a little room.

31:56.539 --> 32:00.675
This kid's got something.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.744
Oh, my goodness.
A touchdown, east dillon lions!

32:02.778 --> 32:04.012
Touchdown!

32:04.046 --> 32:06.548
East scores, and that
is the first touchdown

32:06.582 --> 32:09.317
Mcnulty has given up
in four games.

32:09.352 --> 32:11.686
It looks like
the east dillon lions

32:11.721 --> 32:13.088
Have found an identity,
folks.

32:13.122 --> 32:17.159
And quite possibly a quarterback
that is the real deal.

32:17.193 --> 32:18.827
- Yeah!

32:18.861 --> 32:21.029
- Here we go.
Late in the second half.

32:21.063 --> 32:22.898
These lions have battled
these mavericks

32:22.932 --> 32:24.232
All night long,

32:24.267 --> 32:26.034
And they are just seven
points away

32:26.068 --> 32:27.435
From tying this game up--

32:27.470 --> 32:29.337
Something no one,
including yours truly,

32:29.372 --> 32:31.439
Thought was even remotely
possible.

First down, lions.

33:07.543 --> 33:09.277

33:09.312 --> 33:10.579
- Right there, right there,
right there!

33:10.613 --> 33:14.115
- Under pressure.
Great spin move.

33:14.150 --> 33:16.618
Howard trying to make a play.

33:16.652 --> 33:18.386
He's gonna have to get rid
of the ball!

33:18.421 --> 33:21.223
Oh, and he gets pasted,
in the back field,

33:21.257 --> 33:22.891
The clock winds out,

33:22.925 --> 33:25.560
And the upset is not to be,
folks.

33:25.595 --> 33:26.728
- Get off me, man.

33:26.762 --> 33:29.231
We have seen a team emerge
tonight,

33:29.265 --> 33:32.267
Lead by a young quarterback,
vince howard,

33:32.301 --> 33:33.969
The rising star of the east
dillon lions.

33:34.003 --> 33:35.370
- Hey, let's go.
Bring it in.

33:35.404 --> 33:36.705
Bring it in. Let's go.

33:36.739 --> 33:37.872
- Here we go.

33:37.907 --> 33:40.709
- Come on, fellas.
Let's go.

33:40.743 --> 33:41.977
Hey, listen to me.
Listen, everyone.

33:42.011 --> 33:45.013
Listen up right now.

33:45.047 --> 33:47.115
Every single person
out here--

33:47.149 --> 33:50.585
Every single person out here
respects you fellas.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.687
Every one.
I respect you.

You need to respect yourselves.

33:54.423 --> 33:57.025

Hell of a job.

33:57.059 --> 33:59.094
Take that with you,
carry it,

33:59.128 --> 34:01.396
And we're gonna
build on it.

34:21.217 --> 34:22.449
- No, they just started playing.

34:22.485 --> 34:23.451
Let's finish the set.

34:23.485 --> 34:28.889
- No, do you want me
to leave?

34:28.924 --> 34:30.358
Maybe you were right.

34:30.393 --> 34:32.260
I mean, maybe I should have
left already.

34:32.295 --> 34:35.597
Do you even want me to stay?

34:35.630 --> 34:38.132
- Of course I want you
to stay!

I was just--I was saying
stupid things.

I'm sorry!
I love you, okay?

34:42.505 --> 34:44.172
I'm sorry!
I was being stupid!

okay?

Do you really think
we need a new tv?

Look, this is working
just fine.

something to invest in.

- that's--

39:20.182 --> 39:22.317
I don't really care.
Okay.

39:22.351 --> 39:24.285
And I guess we could think
about getting a new tv.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.921
- Lorraine,
you'd be shocked.

39:26.956 --> 39:28.756
- Would we want to get
a bigger screen, you think?

39:28.791 --> 39:30.024
- Yeah.
- Really?

- Gone.

40:05.828 --> 40:09.797
- I don't know.

40:09.832 --> 40:11.833
- Is she the love of your life?

40:27.683 --> 40:29.150
Maybe there's more
than one soul mate

40:29.184 --> 40:32.286
For everybody, you know?

40:32.321 --> 40:34.956
'cause, like, say I'm born
in texas, right?

40:34.990 --> 40:38.593
And my soul mate's born all
the way over in sri lanka.

40:38.627 --> 40:41.796
That seems randomly unfair.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.136
It only makes sense that there
would be more than one.

40:48.170 --> 40:49.671
You know,
'cause you have your first,

40:49.705 --> 40:54.742
And it's new, and you
feel things that you never

40:54.777 --> 40:58.546
Thought you'd feel
and they break your heart.

40:58.580 --> 41:03.317
Then you cry about it
and you're sad over it...

41:03.352 --> 41:06.854
And then you meet someone else.

41:06.889 --> 41:09.957
And for that time,
they're your new soul mate,

41:09.992 --> 41:15.530
Because they made you feel
things the other one couldn't.
