WEBVTT

00:02.305 --> 00:05.574
Okay, kids, I need your attention.
Come on, gather round.

00:05.576 --> 00:07.442
We have a really big
surprise for you.

00:07.444 --> 00:10.178
Oh, I love surprises. Tell
me, tell me, tell me.

00:10.180 --> 00:11.480
Wait, don't tell me.

00:11.482 --> 00:13.382
Okay, fine, tell me.
No, no, don't.

00:13.384 --> 00:16.318
Dez, you already
know the surprise.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.652
Oh, right.

00:17.654 --> 00:20.188
Wait, remind me. No, no,
no, don't remind me.

00:20.190 --> 00:21.923
Okay, remind me.
No, no, no, don't.

00:21.925 --> 00:26.661
Okay, we're throwing the first
ever A&A music factory showcase.

00:26.663 --> 00:29.798
We invited some record
execs to hear you play.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.968
Ooh, ooh, ooh, can I a rap?
I'm great at rapping.

00:32.970 --> 00:35.337
- Sure, Herman.
- Yes!

00:35.339 --> 00:37.773
Oh, no, all the execs are
going to be wearing suits.

00:37.775 --> 00:41.676
I'm scared of suits... the
blazers, the ties, the vests.

00:41.678 --> 00:43.879
And don't even get me started
on the pocket squares.

00:43.881 --> 00:46.214
What are they even for?

00:46.216 --> 00:48.316
No one's expecting
professionals.

00:48.318 --> 00:50.248
This is just a chance
for you to get some

00:50.279 --> 00:52.554
industry feedback so you
can grow as an artist.

00:52.556 --> 00:54.256
Sounds terrifying.

00:54.258 --> 00:56.258
I'm gonna head to the suit
store across the mall

00:56.260 --> 00:59.728
and practice singing
to some mannequins.

00:59.730 --> 01:03.265
Hey, Herman, we should come up with
a really sick name for our band.

01:03.267 --> 01:05.734
Yeah, something baseball-y,
like the sluggers,

01:05.736 --> 01:10.005
or the name my coach gave our team...
the embarrassments.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.341
I am so excited
for the showcase.

01:13.343 --> 01:15.310
A lot of music execs
will be there.

01:15.312 --> 01:17.245
Even Jimmy starr is coming.

01:17.247 --> 01:18.647
Oh, good. I haven't
seen that guy

01:18.649 --> 01:20.916
since he changed his email,
rejected my friend request

01:20.918 --> 01:23.852
and disabled the tracking
device I put on his car.

01:24.821 --> 01:27.255
Dez, maybe stay away from Jimmy.

01:28.391 --> 01:30.358
Yeah, I'll be staying
away from him too.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.427
That guy officially hates me.

01:32.429 --> 01:33.728
Well, he doesn't hate Ridley.

01:33.730 --> 01:35.730
He loved her at the
karaoke sing-off.

01:35.732 --> 01:38.733
If she nails her performance,
maybe he'll sign her.

01:38.735 --> 01:41.703
Yeah, and then we can get
back on his good side.

01:41.705 --> 01:43.839
Who knows what that
might mean for Austin?

01:43.841 --> 01:45.707
Who knows what that
might mean for me?

01:45.709 --> 01:47.943
Maybe I'll finally get to
take real photos with Jimmy,

01:47.945 --> 01:50.445
instead of the fake ones
I make on my computer.

01:53.816 --> 01:55.784
That was a good day.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.484 --> 03:03.485
You're an awesome dancer.

03:03.487 --> 03:06.388
Are you sure you can't perform
with me at the showcase?

03:06.390 --> 03:08.490
I wish I could, but
Jimmy won't let me.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.791
Anyway, you don't need me.

03:09.793 --> 03:13.562
And you definitely don't need
that first aid kit on your back.

03:13.564 --> 03:16.031
But it makes me feel safe.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.567
I know how you feel.

03:18.569 --> 03:20.869
When I was three, I started
carrying a binkie.

03:20.871 --> 03:22.537
When did you finally give it up?

03:22.539 --> 03:23.907
What do you mean?

03:23.938 --> 03:29.377
Okay, I need to take pictures
for the showcase program.

03:29.379 --> 03:31.046
Ridley, you're up.

03:31.048 --> 03:34.149
Huh-uh. Ponytails
are a photo no-no.

03:34.151 --> 03:36.484
Sorry, who are you?

03:36.486 --> 03:39.387
This is Sadie. She's supposed
to be taking a piano lesson,

03:39.389 --> 03:42.023
but apparently she's more
into what you're doing.

03:42.025 --> 03:46.161
With pop stars, image
is everything.

03:49.031 --> 03:51.166
Hey, you're good at this stuff.

03:51.168 --> 03:56.104
Well, I'll tell you what she's not good
at... staying focused on the piano.

03:56.106 --> 03:58.573
I'm bored with piano.

03:58.575 --> 04:01.676
Guess who wants to
play the trumpet now.

04:01.678 --> 04:03.411
Hmm.

04:03.413 --> 04:07.015
Bored easily, super opinionated.

04:07.017 --> 04:08.617
How do you feel about naps?

04:08.619 --> 04:10.485
Love 'em.

04:10.487 --> 04:14.055
Sounds like there's someone else
here who'd be better as your mentor.

04:14.057 --> 04:15.690
Hint, hint.

04:15.692 --> 04:18.125
I hear you loud and clear.

04:18.128 --> 04:20.595
Come on, Sadie. Do you
like tap dancing?

04:23.633 --> 04:25.567
They meant me.

04:25.569 --> 04:28.803
So what brings you to the
music factory, Sadie?

04:28.805 --> 04:32.741
Well, I don't have any musical talent
and I don't like to work hard.

04:32.743 --> 04:36.978
But I want to make a lot of money off
of other people's talent and hard work.

04:36.980 --> 04:41.850
It's like I'm looking into a mirror...
a very tiny mirror.

04:48.524 --> 04:51.459
Welcome to management 101.

04:51.461 --> 04:54.562
B-t-dubs, did I mention
I love your shoes?

04:54.564 --> 04:57.766
B-t-double-dubs, I
love yours too.

04:58.901 --> 05:02.671
Okay, as a manager, it's your job
to get people to do what you say.

05:02.673 --> 05:04.806
- Dez, sit down.
- Whatever you say.

05:04.808 --> 05:07.509
- Wow, you're good.
- I know.

05:07.511 --> 05:10.011
Now, dealing with industry
types is difficult.

05:10.013 --> 05:12.647
You have to talk fast, be
rude to the assistants,

05:12.649 --> 05:16.718
name drop as much as possible, and when
you're done, send a muffin basket.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.654
Nice. Everybody loves muffins.

05:19.656 --> 05:21.656
And baskets.

05:21.658 --> 05:23.525
Now, why don't you
try a practice call?

05:23.527 --> 05:25.894
Let's role-play. Dez,
you be the assistant.

05:25.896 --> 05:27.662
Ring-ring-ring!

05:29.231 --> 05:31.700
Ring-ring-ring!

05:31.702 --> 05:33.568
Dez.

05:33.570 --> 05:36.004
What? I always pick up on
the third ring-ring-ring.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.806
I don't want to sound desperate.

05:37.808 --> 05:39.240
Fine.

05:39.242 --> 05:41.142
Ring-ring-ring.

05:42.611 --> 05:43.305
Hello, Mr.

05:43.336 --> 05:46.081
I-didn't-have-time-to-come-up
with-a-name's office.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.216
Are you having a
pleasant afternoon?

05:48.218 --> 05:51.286
Let's skip the chitchat. Put
your boss on the phone.

05:51.288 --> 05:52.787
Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.

05:52.789 --> 05:54.689
Psst, Trish. Who's
playing the boss?

05:54.691 --> 05:56.691
- You are.
- Wow.

05:56.693 --> 05:58.593
I got promoted so fast.

05:58.595 --> 06:00.228
Hello, Mr.

06:00.230 --> 06:02.530
I-didn't-have-time-to-come-up
with-a-name speaking.

06:02.532 --> 06:03.865
Can I help you?

06:03.867 --> 06:05.667
Hi, this is Sadie.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.168
My good friend Katy Perry
gave me your number,

06:07.170 --> 06:09.037
and I wanted to invite
you to our showcase.

06:09.039 --> 06:11.873
I will send a muffin basket and
a postcard with more info.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.641
And scene!

06:13.643 --> 06:15.910
Whoo! Nice work, Sadie.

06:15.912 --> 06:18.813
Okay, guys, I've
got a great idea.

06:18.815 --> 06:20.915
We're gonna learn
one of Ally's songs

06:20.917 --> 06:23.585
and surprise her with it at the showcase.
But don't tell her.

06:23.587 --> 06:26.154
A secret? I'm great at secrets.

06:26.156 --> 06:28.723
But I'm terrible
at keeping them.

06:28.725 --> 06:30.959
So what part are you good at?

06:33.129 --> 06:34.662
Oh, Ally's on her way in.

06:34.664 --> 06:36.731
Don't say anything.
Everyone just act cool.

06:38.334 --> 06:40.735
Hey, guys. What are
you working on?

06:51.046 --> 06:54.048
Kids. Am I right?

06:57.219 --> 06:59.788
So, when you're
talking to a client,

06:59.790 --> 07:02.323
it's important to sneak your
criticism between two compliments.

07:02.325 --> 07:04.225
- What do you mean?
- Watch.

07:04.227 --> 07:07.162
Hey, Herman. Heard you
on the drums earlier.

07:07.164 --> 07:09.030
You're sounding better.

07:09.032 --> 07:12.734
You gotta wash that smelly
baseball uniform. Love the hair.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.736
Thanks. You're the best.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.704
Wait, what?

07:17.640 --> 07:20.175
Okay, now you try.

07:21.811 --> 07:24.212
Hey, Ridley. You
have a great voice.

07:24.214 --> 07:27.048
You have no stage presence
and you're going to make

07:27.050 --> 07:29.150
a complete fool of
yourself at the showcase.

07:29.152 --> 07:31.186
Cute shoes.

07:31.188 --> 07:32.720
What?

07:32.722 --> 07:34.756
I'm gonna make a fool of myself?

07:34.758 --> 07:37.025
No. Sadie, why would
you say that?

07:37.027 --> 07:38.827
Trish told me to be honest.

07:38.829 --> 07:41.930
Ridley has potential, but
she's so nervous and awkward.

07:41.932 --> 07:43.765
She needs a lot of help.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.901
Ridley, don't listen to her.
Sadie took it way too far.

07:46.903 --> 07:48.703
No, she's right.

07:48.705 --> 07:50.271
I don't have what it takes.

07:50.273 --> 07:52.207
I'm not performing
at the showcase.

07:52.209 --> 07:53.775
I'm not performing ever.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.710
Ridley, wait.

07:55.712 --> 07:58.179
Trish, how could you
let this happen?

07:58.181 --> 07:59.881
We need Ridley in the showcase.

07:59.883 --> 08:01.683
The showcase is to showcase her.

08:01.685 --> 08:03.751
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to give Sadie

08:03.753 --> 08:05.720
a lesson on giving
constructive criticism.

08:05.722 --> 08:08.022
It sounded more like
destructive criticism.

08:08.024 --> 08:09.724
I'm gonna go get Ridley.

08:09.726 --> 08:12.026
When she freaks out, she likes
to go to the camping store

08:12.028 --> 08:13.862
and hide in the sleeping bags.

08:13.864 --> 08:17.065
Sadie, I think you may have
taken my lesson the wrong way.

08:17.067 --> 08:20.401
Look, Trish, you're a really good mentor,
but I'm better at this than you,

08:20.403 --> 08:22.804
and from now on I'm
gonna do things my way.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.706
Nice headband.

08:24.708 --> 08:26.741
Aww, thank...

08:26.743 --> 08:28.042
wait. Darn.

08:28.044 --> 08:30.144
I've taught her too well.

08:40.356 --> 08:42.724
Is that Ridley?

08:42.726 --> 08:44.025
No.

08:44.027 --> 08:45.994
I went all the way
to the camping store

08:45.996 --> 08:48.696
and brought back some other
kid hiding in a sleeping bag.

08:52.301 --> 08:53.701
Whew.

08:53.703 --> 08:55.837
Hey, guys.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.873
Look, Ridley, I know you're worried
about performing at the showcase,

08:58.875 --> 09:00.775
but what's the worst
thing that can happen?

09:00.777 --> 09:04.779
Well, my performance could be so bad
that the audience throws tomatoes at me.

09:04.781 --> 09:06.447
And smashed tomatoes
make ketchup.

09:06.449 --> 09:09.751
And ketchup goes on French fries,
and French fries are potatoes.

09:09.753 --> 09:11.153
And you know what
else is a potato?

09:11.154 --> 09:14.455
Yams. And I'm terrified of yams.

09:14.457 --> 09:17.892
Come on, Ridley, we've
got a lot work to do.

09:23.365 --> 09:26.367
Trish, you've created a monster.

09:26.369 --> 09:28.369
Sadie's got Ridley freaking out.

09:28.371 --> 09:31.372
She demanded a V.I.P. Parking
spot for her bicycle.

09:31.374 --> 09:34.275
And look what she did to
amp up Max's star appeal.

09:35.945 --> 09:38.913
I am not happy.

09:38.915 --> 09:40.915
Fine.

09:40.917 --> 09:43.518
- I'll go talk to her.
- She's in her office.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.853
Office?

09:49.525 --> 09:51.459
Move, Dez. I need
to talk to Sadie.

09:51.461 --> 09:53.194
Do you have an appointment?

09:53.196 --> 09:56.164
- Appointment?
- Yeah, Sadie hired me as her assistant.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.333
I even get to wear
this cool headset.

09:58.335 --> 10:00.868
Sadie and associates.
Please hold.

10:00.870 --> 10:05.039
Dez, we both know that is
not plugged into anything.

10:05.041 --> 10:07.909
And we both know there's
nothing in that mug.

10:10.045 --> 10:11.913
I'll call you back.

10:11.915 --> 10:16.284
I'm sorry, but unless you have an
appointment, I can't help you.

10:16.286 --> 10:18.219
Sadie's in a very big
meeting right now.

10:21.857 --> 10:24.092
I can see her sleeping in there.

10:24.094 --> 10:25.860
Can you do 5:30?

10:25.862 --> 10:28.963
Do you seriously think I'm
gonna wait around six hours

10:28.965 --> 10:30.898
to talk to an
obnoxious little kid

10:30.900 --> 10:33.901
who locked herself in a sound
booth in my music factory?

10:33.903 --> 10:36.104
You're right.

10:36.106 --> 10:39.040
Oh, we just had a cancellation.
How's 4:30?

10:39.042 --> 10:40.575
Sure.

10:40.577 --> 10:42.243
And you are?

10:50.954 --> 10:53.087
Sounds great. When
Ally hears you

10:53.089 --> 10:55.356
playing her song at the
showcase, she's gonna freak.

10:55.358 --> 10:56.924
Let's try the song again.

10:59.428 --> 11:00.862
Oh, hey, Ally.

11:07.903 --> 11:14.142
Um, Austin, is this the song
they're playing at the showcase?

11:14.144 --> 11:16.911
Yeah, it's experimental.

11:16.913 --> 11:21.416
I think you'll be surprised by
how good it sounds at the show.

11:28.424 --> 11:31.092
What's up with Herman?
Is he okay?

11:31.094 --> 11:32.927
He's doing his
breathing exercises.

11:32.929 --> 11:36.030
Breathing exercises?
He plays drums.

11:36.032 --> 11:39.333
You know what they say... "a friend
in need is a friend indeed."

11:39.335 --> 11:42.336
- What does that have to do...?
- Well, see ya.

11:42.338 --> 11:44.439
Ally, we're playing your
song at the showcase.

11:44.441 --> 11:47.875
Whew, that was a close one.

11:52.147 --> 11:55.883
That's exactly what Taylor
Swift said to me yesterday.

11:57.286 --> 12:00.488
Sadie moved her office
into the dance studio?

12:00.490 --> 12:04.058
Yes, we thought a bigger space would
be better for her growing business.

12:05.494 --> 12:08.362
Your 4:30 is here.

12:08.364 --> 12:11.999
Sweetie, have a seat.

12:15.904 --> 12:17.572
I know what you're doing.

12:17.574 --> 12:21.576
You made my chair lower than yours
to make yourself seem more powerful.

12:21.578 --> 12:23.044
I taught you that.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.346
I don't know what you mean.

12:36.925 --> 12:39.026
Okay, you are taking
this way too far.

12:39.028 --> 12:41.362
You're not a real manager.
You're a kid.

12:41.364 --> 12:44.165
That's not what my card says.

12:44.167 --> 12:46.934
You're right, that's not
what your card says.

12:46.936 --> 12:49.070
That says you're a manger.

12:50.472 --> 12:52.540
Dez!

12:52.542 --> 12:55.710
I am so sorry. I'll
get these reprinted.

12:55.712 --> 12:58.012
Bottom line, you're
out of control.

12:58.014 --> 13:00.014
We almost lost Ridley
because of you.

13:00.016 --> 13:02.049
I gave her the push she needed.

13:02.051 --> 13:05.453
She'd be way better off with me
as her manager instead of you.

13:05.455 --> 13:06.797
You know what? I've had enough.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.524
I'm sorry, but you're no
longer welcome at this school.

13:09.526 --> 13:11.192
Fine. I'm out of here.

13:12.528 --> 13:14.028
Dez!

13:14.030 --> 13:16.130
Get me down!

13:18.000 --> 13:20.268
And cancel her muffin basket.

13:24.273 --> 13:26.974
Thanks for making the snacks
for the showcase, Dez.

13:26.976 --> 13:28.709
Oh, I forgot about the showcase.

13:28.711 --> 13:30.978
This is just my dinner.

13:30.980 --> 13:32.446
Your dinner is 200
teeny weenies?

13:32.448 --> 13:34.615
No, that would be crazy.

13:34.617 --> 13:37.752
I'm also having these
400 cheese cubes.

13:39.087 --> 13:42.156
I can't wait for
Ridley's performance.

13:42.158 --> 13:44.158
I know Jimmy's looking
for a young singer.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.028
If he thought she was great before,
wait till he sees her now.

13:47.030 --> 13:49.030
He might really
want to sign her.

13:49.032 --> 13:50.998
She could be his
next Austin moon.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.068
Yeah, but, like, newer,
younger, shinier.

13:54.070 --> 13:55.536
Uh, hello.

13:55.538 --> 13:57.171
Original Austin moon right here.

13:57.173 --> 13:59.273
And I'm still pretty shiny.

13:59.275 --> 14:01.142
Yeah, you are.

14:02.644 --> 14:04.345
- Dez.
- Yeah.

14:05.581 --> 14:08.149
Come on, guys, we've got a
packed house down there

14:08.151 --> 14:09.684
waiting for an amazing showcase.

14:09.686 --> 14:11.752
Whoo!

14:15.157 --> 14:18.492
Well, I guess now I don't
have to share my weenies.

14:21.129 --> 14:24.131
No one showed up
to our showcase.

14:24.133 --> 14:29.103
Hey, look on the bright side... maybe
they were all eaten by zombies.

14:29.105 --> 14:32.540
Trish, I thought you said we were
gonna have a packed house tonight.

14:32.542 --> 14:37.044
We were supposed to. 100 people
emailed that they were coming. Look.

14:37.046 --> 14:38.579
Sadie.

14:38.581 --> 14:40.781
That little brat
broke into my email

14:40.783 --> 14:43.484
and told all the record execs
our showcase was canceled.

14:43.486 --> 14:45.319
- She did what?
- And look.

14:45.321 --> 14:47.588
She sent out invites for
her own showcase tonight.

14:47.590 --> 14:50.558
It features Ridley and a
secret celebrity guest.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.727
Sadie stole our showcase.

14:52.729 --> 14:56.297
Oh, that's why she wanted
your email, password,

14:56.299 --> 15:00.301
contacts, and
showcase invite list.

15:00.303 --> 15:02.103
Weenie?

15:12.815 --> 15:15.016
Okay, where is that little brat?

15:15.018 --> 15:17.552
Hopefully she didn't do
anything to make Jimmy upset.

15:17.554 --> 15:20.555
I'm very upset. First,
your showcase is canceled.

15:20.557 --> 15:22.557
Then I come to this
one, and it's a mess.

15:22.559 --> 15:24.526
I don't see any performers.
There's no free food.

15:24.528 --> 15:27.529
And that rugby team's taking up
every seat with their pizza party.

15:27.531 --> 15:29.397
Oi, oi, oi!

15:29.399 --> 15:32.167
There's been a mix-up,
but we're gonna fix it.

15:32.169 --> 15:34.169
Oh, Ridley, there you are.

15:34.171 --> 15:37.973
Don't be mad. I'm only here 'cause
Sadie told me the venue changed.

15:37.975 --> 15:39.407
Where is she?

15:39.409 --> 15:41.076
Never mind. I see her.

15:43.012 --> 15:44.713
Come back here, young lady.

15:45.848 --> 15:47.849
Please don't yell at me.

15:47.851 --> 15:50.919
Nothing you say can make me
feel worse than I already do.

15:50.921 --> 15:52.721
What were you thinking, Sadie?

15:52.723 --> 15:56.192
I wanted to prove that I
could be a real manager.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.694
I guess I had no idea what actually
went into planning a showcase.

15:59.696 --> 16:04.466
I have no lights, no musical
instruments, no celebrity guest.

16:04.468 --> 16:05.967
But your invite said...

16:05.969 --> 16:07.869
I just wrote that so
people would come.

16:07.871 --> 16:09.571
I'm sorry.

16:09.573 --> 16:11.573
I don't want to be
a manager anymore.

16:11.575 --> 16:15.577
I want to go back to being a
normal kid, with an assistant.

16:15.579 --> 16:17.812
I did like that part.

16:17.814 --> 16:21.616
Look, Sadie, we're not gonna
let this showcase fall apart.

16:21.618 --> 16:25.787
You may be in over your head, but it's
our job to teach you how to fix it.

16:25.789 --> 16:26.955
Really?

16:26.957 --> 16:30.692
I'm gonna go get the rest of the kids
and have Austin set up the stage.

16:30.694 --> 16:33.495
Ally can be our celebrity guest.

16:33.497 --> 16:36.131
Dez!

16:36.133 --> 16:38.099
I need you to get rid
of the rugby team.

16:40.871 --> 16:43.471
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

17:38.828 --> 17:43.098
Give it up for the
multi-talented Herman!

17:43.100 --> 17:46.201
Next up... the A&A music
factory house band.

17:56.145 --> 17:58.680
Austin, you taught
them my new song?

17:58.682 --> 18:00.682
They've been rehearsing
it all week.

18:00.684 --> 18:02.717
I wanted it to be a surprise.

18:02.719 --> 18:06.154
I am so touched.

18:06.156 --> 18:08.656
Thank you.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.626
You knew, didn't you?

18:11.628 --> 18:13.795
Herman told me 10 minutes ago.

18:17.100 --> 18:22.570
And now, ladies and gentlemen, our
secret celebrity guest Ally Dawson!

19:24.934 --> 19:26.935
Whoo!

19:26.937 --> 19:29.070
You guys were awesome.
I'm so proud of you.

19:29.072 --> 19:32.106
Trish, thank you so much
for saving the showcase.

19:32.108 --> 19:34.809
I'm really sorry I
ever went against you.

19:34.811 --> 19:37.779
It's cool. You have
a lot of potential.

19:37.781 --> 19:40.915
If you ever cross me
again, I will destroy you.

19:40.917 --> 19:42.684
Cute jacket.

19:44.787 --> 19:46.788
Bravo, gang.

19:46.790 --> 19:48.289
Jimmy!

19:48.291 --> 19:52.427
I gotta say, that was the best
showcase I've seen in a long time.

19:52.429 --> 19:55.763
And there's one performer I'm
particularly interested in.

19:56.732 --> 19:59.400
I knew it! Where do I sign?

19:59.402 --> 20:02.837
I was talking about Ridley,
but you're good too.

20:02.839 --> 20:04.939
I'll take it.

20:04.941 --> 20:08.776
I knew you could sing, but the music
factory's taken you to the next level.

20:08.778 --> 20:10.845
Austin and I have been working
really hard with her.

20:10.847 --> 20:14.849
Ridley Rogers, how would you like to
be in business with Starr Records?

20:16.919 --> 20:19.187
Wow, I would love to.

20:19.189 --> 20:21.089
Hang on a sec, Jimmy.

20:21.091 --> 20:24.726
As Ridley's manager, it would appear
that we have something you want

20:24.728 --> 20:26.761
and you have something we want.

20:26.763 --> 20:28.363
Maybe we can work out a deal.

20:28.365 --> 20:30.098
Let me guess:

20:30.100 --> 20:32.233
You want me to let
Austin perform again.

20:32.235 --> 20:34.168
Trish, what are you doing?

20:34.170 --> 20:37.338
This isn't about me. It's about
helping one of our students.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.340
I don't want to stand in the
way of her opportunity.

20:39.342 --> 20:42.343
Austin, you can't keep putting your
heart in front of your career.

20:42.345 --> 20:44.345
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

20:44.347 --> 20:48.149
I've been doing a lot of thinking,
and maybe I overreacted in the past.

20:48.151 --> 20:51.319
I gotta say, I miss seeing
Austin moon on that stage.

20:51.321 --> 20:53.788
And so do millions of his fans.

20:53.790 --> 20:57.091
And so does his manager, who
gets 10% of his paycheck.

20:57.093 --> 20:59.527
So what do you say, Jimmy?

21:01.463 --> 21:03.731
- You've got a deal.
- Yes!

21:04.833 --> 21:06.734
Ridley, welcome
to Starr Records.

21:06.736 --> 21:09.737
And Austin moon, welcome back.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.172
Thanks, Jimmy.

21:12.841 --> 21:15.009
Hey, Jimbo, we giving
out hugs over here?

21:15.011 --> 21:17.045
No, we are not.

21:17.047 --> 21:19.847
That guy kills me.

21:32.061 --> 21:33.761
Welcome to Austin
and associates.

21:33.763 --> 21:35.096
Do you have an appointment?

21:35.098 --> 21:36.798
We don't need an appointment.

21:38.067 --> 21:40.802
Dez, can you please just
move out of the way?

21:40.804 --> 21:42.870
We need to talk to Austin
about his comeback.

21:42.872 --> 21:44.539
I'm sorry, and you are?

21:44.541 --> 21:47.108
Ally Dawson.

21:47.110 --> 21:49.510
Austin's girlfriend.

21:49.512 --> 21:51.145
That you see every day.

21:51.147 --> 21:53.081
Doesn't ring a bell.

21:53.083 --> 21:56.551
Listen, Austin is very busy
working on his comeback.

21:56.553 --> 21:59.420
I can schedule you in for
a week from Tuesday.

21:59.422 --> 22:01.856
Oops, no, that's staff
evaluations day.

22:01.858 --> 22:03.791
Sorry about this.

22:03.793 --> 22:06.894
I tried to fire him, but he said I
had to give him two weeks' notice.

22:06.896 --> 22:08.296
How about next Wednesday?

22:08.298 --> 22:10.131
No, that's the company picnic.

22:10.133 --> 22:11.299
Next Thursday?

22:11.301 --> 22:12.867
No, that's our team
building workshop.

22:12.869 --> 22:15.103
Next Friday? That's
our wellness retreat.

22:15.105 --> 22:16.471
How about Saturday?

22:16.473 --> 22:18.106
Nope, we don't work on weekends.

22:18.108 --> 22:20.074
How about Monday? Nope,
that's secretary day.

22:20.076 --> 22:21.809
Austin is taking
me out for steaks.

22:21.811 --> 22:23.845
Or how about next tuesda-a-a-ay?

22:24.305 --> 22:30.698
