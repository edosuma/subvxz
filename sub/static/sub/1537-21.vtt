08:19.936 --> 08:21.837
[exhales]

08:21.838 --> 08:23.179
So it is.

08:32.779 --> 08:33.979
Seems about right.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.347
(Rosa)
What's wrong with you?

08:35.347 --> 08:38.951
You and Majors have too much fun
last night at "The Keychain?"

08:38.952 --> 08:41.453
Okay, it's a private bar,
not a haunted motel.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.522
And no,
I did not have a good time.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.324
Turns out he didn't want
to be best bros at all.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.992
He just wanted to know
if I was cool with him

08:46.993 --> 08:48.394
asking Amy out
when the case ended.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.795
I thought he was dating
that weather girl.

08:49.796 --> 08:50.996
No, he dumped her because she
blamed Hurricane Sandy

08:50.997 --> 08:52.364
on gay marriage.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.666
Anyways,
now when the case ends,

08:53.667 --> 08:56.101
Amy is gonna marry
Detective "Blotter Dynamite."

08:56.102 --> 08:57.169
Why do you even care?

08:57.170 --> 08:58.537
You still like her?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.673
I don't know.
I mean, we're friends.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.841
And things have been
kind of flirty lately.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.044
Plus, we had this weird
romantic moment thing-y

09:05.045 --> 09:06.679
at Charles and Gina's
parents' wedding.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.414
Ugh, just say you like her.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.149
All right, fine,
I still like her.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.817
Look, I've been thinking
about asking her out

09:11.818 --> 09:13.319
for the last couple of weeks,
but it's hard.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.087
There's so much buildup now,
you know?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.221
Not really.
I don't ask people out.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.623
I just tell them
where we're going.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.325
Great, well,
it doesn't matter now anyway,

09:19.326 --> 09:20.526
'cause I told Dave
to go for it.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.527
That was crazy stupid.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.562
Sorry.
That was normal stupid.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.997
You should have told him
to back off.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.832
I can't go around telling guys
not to ask Amy out

09:26.833 --> 09:29.101
because I like her and I'm too
dumb to do anything about it.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.569
I can't make
a woman's choice for her.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.271
I stand with Wendy.
Did I do that right?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.339
- No.
- Oh.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.241
Look, If you want to give her
a real choice,

09:35.242 --> 09:38.877
you've got to let her know
that you an option.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.346
I think you know
what you've got to do.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.680
Yeah.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.249
Ask her out before
the case ends, right?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.683
I just want to be
extra clear.

09:44.684 --> 09:47.019
The stakes for me are through
the roof for me on this one.

09:49.956 --> 09:50.956
You wanted to see us?

09:50.957 --> 09:52.725
What are these
requisition forms?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.961
We are throwing Terry
a "please stay" party.

09:55.962 --> 09:59.665
My vision is a frozen yogurt
machine operated by Pam Grier.

09:59.666 --> 10:03.302
Sir, we think Sarge is going
to accept Copperhead's offer.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.837
I never thought
I'd say these words:

10:04.838 --> 10:07.139
You have to put Gina in touch
with Pam Grier.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.074
No, Sergeant Jeffords
can make up his mind

10:09.075 --> 10:11.810
without the influence
of Foxy Brown or cold yogurt.

10:11.811 --> 10:12.912
He is a grown man.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.180
Oh,
I see what's going on here

10:15.181 --> 10:17.116
You're upset that Terry
would even consider

10:17.117 --> 10:18.550
leaving the Nine-Nine.

10:18.551 --> 10:22.354
I'd expect this pettiness from
a spineless amoeba like Charles,

10:22.389 --> 10:23.475
but not you, Sir.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.690
I'm not spineless.

10:24.691 --> 10:25.691
Come on, Charles.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.692
Yep.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.628
(Amy)
Ahh, look who's finally here.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.196
We already solved the case
without you.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.565
What?
You did?

10:32.566 --> 10:33.866
Kidding.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.367
Oliver was actually giving us
some pretty bad news.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.902
Carry on, Oliver.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.404
So we swabbed the whole van.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.905
We didn't find anything.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.907
No hairs, no fibers, no semen.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.543
And a rental van is usually
a frickin' Jackson Pollock.

10:44.578 --> 10:45.578
All right.

10:45.579 --> 10:46.679
They also wiped
down the masks

10:46.680 --> 10:48.447
with some sort of
bleach solution.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.216
They were really
covering their tracks.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.784
Check it out.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.419
Well,
that wasn't very helpful.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.955
Although, I did learn I should
never rent a van again.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.023
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second privately?

10:58.024 --> 10:59.892
Sure.
Oh, wait.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.594
This isn't gonna be that thing
where you pretend you got

11:01.595 --> 11:02.928
an important text from Holt,

11:02.929 --> 11:04.430
and it's just that video
of screaming sheep.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.066
I promise you it's not,
but I do stand by that prank.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.970
So what's up?

11:10.971 --> 11:15.007
Okay, I almost feel
weird saying this,

11:15.008 --> 11:17.376
but I wanted to ask you...

11:17.377 --> 11:19.078
wow, those pictures
are not helping.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.512
Oh, my God.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.281
They're really gonna
have to re-grout.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.916
Ugh, finding a contractor.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.251
You are so consistent.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.253
Anyways, the question I wanted
to ask you is...

11:27.254 --> 11:29.054
(Oliver) So I got the results
on that feces.

11:29.055 --> 11:32.157
It's human,
but it's not all human.

11:32.158 --> 11:33.359
You're not Dr. Gassner.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.393
We are not.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.561
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.896
Real quick,
what was the other...

11:36.897 --> 11:38.130
Dog and bear.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.431
Wow.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.433
I thought you'd really
be into that feces puzzle.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.868
Normally, yes.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.037
But I want to talk to you
about something else right now.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.338
More specifically...

11:46.339 --> 11:48.340
- Guys, dispatch called.
- Great, Dave's here now.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.042
The check-cashing babies
just struck on Flatbush.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.043
We've got to go.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.411
Lead the way.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.079
What did you want to tell me?

11:54.080 --> 11:58.017
Oh, Captain Holt sent
a very important text.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.118
Oh.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.086
[sheep bleating]

12:05.258 --> 12:06.292
[chuckles]

12:07.294 --> 12:08.294
[sniffs]

12:08.295 --> 12:09.461
What's that smell?

12:09.462 --> 12:12.331
That's lavender.
Terry loves lavender.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.500
A little homemade
honey yogurt

12:14.501 --> 12:17.636
infused with
lavender and love.

12:17.637 --> 12:21.106
Mmm, that is delicious.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.641
Hold it.

12:22.642 --> 12:25.044
This isn't some weird breast
milk or something is it, Boyle?

12:25.045 --> 12:27.179
I mean, technically
it's from a sheep's breast.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.481
Hey, Terry,
got any new baby pics?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.283
You hate looking at
pictures of my twins.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.718
You said since they
were identical,

12:32.752 --> 12:34.453
I didn't need to take
photos of both.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.355
That doesn't sound
like Auntie Gina.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.290
I love your baby pics

12:38.291 --> 12:41.227
and your stories about
the twins' sleep schedules.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.063
Okay, I know what
you two are doing.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.631
This is your weird way
of trying

12:45.632 --> 12:47.967
to make me stay
at the Nine-Nine.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.469
Well, I am loving it.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.770
[laughter]

12:51.771 --> 12:54.140
You know, the funny thing is,
Cagney naps better,

12:54.141 --> 12:56.675
but at night,
that's Lacey's time to shine.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.077
One time,
she went 8-to-8.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.178
- Dang.
- Wow.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.546
I know.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.882
(Ray) Jeffords, I need you to digitize
all your case files

13:02.883 --> 13:05.918
from 1995 to 1999 inclusive
by tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.686
But it's already 1:00.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.688
I told Sharon
we'd have dinner tonight.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.624
I was gonna have
a cup of coffee

13:11.625 --> 13:14.460
so that I could stay up
and... kiss.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.929
I suggest putting that
caffeine towards something

13:16.930 --> 13:20.566
more productive
than "kissing."

13:20.567 --> 13:22.735
Sir, what are you doing?

13:22.736 --> 13:24.804
Making sure that Jeffords'
case files are digitized

13:24.805 --> 13:26.806
by tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.341
I thought I was
perfectly clear.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.745
I've got to call my wife,
tell her date night is off.

13:32.746 --> 13:36.182
I sent her all those kiss-face
emojis for no damn reason.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.750
(Gina)
Oh, no.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.785
Despite what I've been
saying for years,

13:39.786 --> 13:42.555
that ass just might quit.

13:42.556 --> 13:43.956
I don't get it.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.458
There's no rhyme or reason
to the locations they hit.

13:45.459 --> 13:47.092
This place was so
well-guarded.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.561
And why not hit the one
down the street

13:48.562 --> 13:49.895
that just has an old man
out front?

13:49.896 --> 13:52.398
It just seems so random.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.868
Yeah, it's like...
oh, that feels great.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.169
I don't think it's random.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.904
These guys are too good,
you know.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.473
We'll crack it.

14:00.474 --> 14:01.874
I'm gonna go grab
some coffee.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.442
Great.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.144
Mm.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.079
Hey, now that it's just us,

14:07.080 --> 14:09.749
there's a thing
I wanted to...

14:09.750 --> 14:12.418
to say a-da-za you.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.686
Why doesn't your mouth work?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.287
Why doesn't your mouth work?
Title of our sex tape.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.255
- What?
- Your sex tape.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.623
What?
No.

14:17.624 --> 14:21.527
Look,
here's what I wanted to say.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.395
Oh, no.
I figured it out.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.131
- Huh?
- Here, look.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.500
The trash cans, the van,
the jumpsuit,

14:27.501 --> 14:29.268
they all say
"Johnny's Janitorial."

14:29.269 --> 14:30.302
Not random.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.204
They cased each location
as cleaners.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.039
No wonder the van
was so spotless.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.174
(Dave)
Hey, what did I miss?

14:35.175 --> 14:36.675
Jake just solved the case.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.744
Holy crap.
That's awesome.

14:38.745 --> 14:39.745
[laughs]

14:39.746 --> 14:40.980
All right.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.983
I mean, but, you know,
it's not totally done yet.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.618
You know,
still a long way to go.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.787
Tons of paperwork,
and a case is never truly done

14:47.788 --> 14:49.121
until the trial is complete

14:49.122 --> 14:51.657
and the sentence is served
completely to its fruition

14:51.658 --> 14:52.892
in prison.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.560
Jake, just celebrate.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.429
Okay.

14:56.430 --> 14:58.197
Wow.

15:00.951 --> 15:02.285
(Rosa)
Why the long face?

15:02.286 --> 15:04.287
That Mexican candy
giving you nerve damage again?

15:04.321 --> 15:06.322
Probably, but who even cares?

15:06.323 --> 15:07.590
Why did I solve the case?

15:07.625 --> 15:09.092
Why couldn't I have just
let those guys continue

15:09.093 --> 15:10.627
to terrorize Brooklyn
until I built up the nerve

15:10.628 --> 15:11.628
to ask out a girl?

15:11.662 --> 15:12.729
You're a good cop.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.090
Do not beat yourself up
about that.

15:14.098 --> 15:15.565
I'm not a good cop.
I'm an amazing cop.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.185
And I'll never
forgive myself.

15:17.201 --> 15:19.035
The case is over,
Amy and Majors are on their way

15:19.036 --> 15:20.170
to The Keychain right now.

15:20.171 --> 15:21.171
It's too late.

15:21.172 --> 15:22.472
Has she done
the double tuck yet?

15:22.473 --> 15:24.040
When Amy really likes a guy,

15:24.041 --> 15:25.442
she gets nervous
and tucks her hair

15:25.443 --> 15:27.711
behind both ears
at the same time.

15:27.712 --> 15:29.813
[giggles]

15:29.814 --> 15:31.614
Well, I can never unsee that,

15:31.615 --> 15:33.249
but no,
she has not done that yet.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.284
Then there's still time.

15:34.318 --> 15:36.586
Get in there
and bust up her date.

15:36.587 --> 15:37.687
Show her you care.

15:37.688 --> 15:38.922
Ruin her night.

15:38.956 --> 15:40.990
You really have
a unique take on love.

15:46.230 --> 15:49.232
Ugh, I've only gotten through
September of 1995.

15:49.266 --> 15:50.466
What are you guys doing here?

15:50.467 --> 15:52.301
Blowing your stupid mind.

15:52.302 --> 15:53.836
We did the rest
of the files for you.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.772
Seriously?

15:55.773 --> 15:57.640
I'm gonna text my wife.

15:57.641 --> 16:00.143
Now there's time for dinner
and a movie.

16:00.144 --> 16:02.078
And none of that
"on demand" crap.

16:02.079 --> 16:05.848
Tonight I'm gonna fall asleep
in a real movie theater.

16:05.883 --> 16:08.318
Yeah, that's how we do it
in the Nine-Nine.

16:08.319 --> 16:09.686
We got each others' backs.

16:09.687 --> 16:10.753
Damn right.

16:10.754 --> 16:13.022
Charles, make your own point.

16:13.023 --> 16:14.457
Don't just pile onto mine.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.825
(Ray)
Gina, where have you been?

16:15.859 --> 16:17.126
You left your cell phone
on your desk,

16:17.127 --> 16:18.261
and I assumed you were dead.

16:18.295 --> 16:20.596
Mm, I would clearly be
buried with my phone.

16:20.631 --> 16:24.600
Sir, these guys already
digitized all my files for me.

16:24.601 --> 16:26.369
- Isn't that amazing?
- What?

16:26.403 --> 16:28.438
Why did you snatch up
Sergeant Jeffords' task?

16:28.472 --> 16:30.039
Because we're trying
to get him to stay.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.708
Well, that's not your job.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.343
Jeffords, you can
stay here and digitize

16:33.344 --> 16:35.778
2000 through 2005 inclusive.

16:35.779 --> 16:37.146
I expect it done
by the morning.

16:40.484 --> 16:41.517
Great.

16:41.518 --> 16:43.119
Now I have to re-cancel
on Sharon.

16:43.153 --> 16:46.222
If I worked at Copperhead,
I'd be home by now

16:46.223 --> 16:47.991
swimming in a pool
of gold coins,

16:47.992 --> 16:49.959
like my boy, Scrooge McDuck.

16:49.994 --> 16:51.494
[muffled music]

16:51.495 --> 16:54.130
[knocking]

16:54.164 --> 16:55.531
Password?

16:55.566 --> 16:57.200
- Tropical.
- Mm-mm.

16:57.234 --> 16:59.268
That's an old password.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.336
It changes every night.

17:00.371 --> 17:04.007
All right, fine.
Tropical one?

17:04.040 --> 17:05.474
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Augh!

17:05.509 --> 17:07.443
Ahh!

17:07.444 --> 17:10.012
Ha-ha.
Not cool, okay?

17:10.013 --> 17:12.448
Look, just ask Milo
the bartender, all right?

17:12.449 --> 17:14.584
He knows me.
Tell him Orange Soda is back.

17:14.585 --> 17:15.917
I don't know no Milo.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.488
The bartenders also change
their names every night.

17:18.521 --> 17:22.659
And get out of here until
you know the password, man.

17:22.693 --> 17:25.428
Damn it.
This place is so cool.

17:27.431 --> 17:28.431
Come on, strangers.

17:28.432 --> 17:30.733
Show me your lips.

17:30.768 --> 17:32.135
There you go.

17:32.169 --> 17:33.603
Got it.

17:37.241 --> 17:39.609
[knocking]

17:39.643 --> 17:41.411
Pepper.

17:41.412 --> 17:42.412
Pooper.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.848
[knocking]

17:45.883 --> 17:47.950
Popcorn.

17:47.951 --> 17:49.686
[knocking]

17:49.687 --> 17:51.521
Plor-pa-pa.

17:51.522 --> 17:52.855
Plorp.

17:52.856 --> 17:53.856
Pa-aark.

17:53.857 --> 17:55.158
Parked.

17:55.159 --> 17:56.993
Okay.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.767
Yeah.

18:04.768 --> 18:07.937
Nooorse.

18:11.775 --> 18:12.875
Bull's-eye.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.814
Oh, no, the double tuck.

18:17.815 --> 18:19.515
[clears throat]

18:19.516 --> 18:21.684
Oh, hey.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.987
You wouldn't kick out a hopeless
romantic who's only here

18:23.988 --> 18:25.288
in the name of love,
would you?

18:25.289 --> 18:27.290
Ooh, you would.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.877
(Gina)
Terry!

18:31.878 --> 18:33.545
So what happened at breakfast
with Gary?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.280
Are you leaving us
for Copperhead?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.949
Because I'm prepared to light
Charles on fire in protest.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.384
Relax.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.187
I declined the offer,
told them I wasn't interested.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.188
Eat it, Gary.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.623
I gave him back all his swag,

18:44.624 --> 18:49.094
except the puffy vest,
which I, uh, lost.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.503
I'm staying
at the Nine-Nine!

18:58.504 --> 19:00.339
[cheers and applause]

19:00.340 --> 19:02.507
(Ray)
Great news, Sergeant.

19:02.508 --> 19:03.709
Really?

19:03.710 --> 19:06.278
So you're done trying
to push him out, Yoko?

19:06.279 --> 19:09.014
(Terry) Whoa, don't give
Captain Holt a hard time.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.382
He's the reason I'm staying.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.984
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.653
You're an adult, and you came
to your own decision.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.989
Look at me.
I can't keep a straight face.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.924
I played you like a fiddle.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.125
Yeah, you did.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.127
Digitizing those old files
reminded me

19:22.128 --> 19:25.564
of all the cases I worked and
all the good we do in community.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.600
What's best for my family
is that they grow up with a dad

19:28.601 --> 19:30.035
who's proud of what he does.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.603
Thank you, Captain.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.171
Look at you.

19:33.172 --> 19:37.175
You're like the wise old owl
from those lollipop commercials.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.777
Terry's back!

19:38.778 --> 19:40.345
[cheers and applause]

19:40.646 --> 19:42.614
(Dave)
Hey, buddy, sorry I'm late.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.583
I had to get this dumb medal
from the commissioner

19:44.584 --> 19:46.151
for a double-murder
I solved last year.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.152
Been there.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.753
I had a pretty crazy
morning myself.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.789
Jake, your taquitos exploded
in the toaster oven.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.024
Thanks, Rosa.
10-4. Copy that.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.459
So how did it go
with Santiago?

19:54.460 --> 19:55.894
Actually, she wasn't into it.

19:55.895 --> 19:56.895
Swing and a miss.

19:56.896 --> 19:57.896
You're kidding.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.064
Yeah, it was really weird.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.498
I've never been
turned down before,

20:00.499 --> 20:02.033
so unexpected.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.136
I'm excited to see
what happens to me next.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.137
Okay.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.742
So... Blotter Dynamite
struck out, huh?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.043
I know, but why?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.878
What does it mean,
and why did she double tuck?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.247
And how come she
turned him down?

20:15.248 --> 20:16.381
Do you think it has
something to do with me?

20:16.382 --> 20:17.382
- Rosa, what is she thinking?
- Jake.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.683
Yeah,
I should ask her myself.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.987
Hey, you just missed Majors.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.922
I've got to say, he was looking
a little bit rough,

20:23.923 --> 20:26.524
almost like he was up all night
crying or something.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.659
Ha-ha, Jake.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.994
I'm sure he's fine.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.496
So...
what happened?

20:31.497 --> 20:33.164
Well, I thought
we were getting a drink

20:33.165 --> 20:34.399
to celebrate
closing the case.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.534
But apparently,
he thought it was a date.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.003
Right, and you were
not into that,

20:38.004 --> 20:40.672
because he's so muscular
and in command of his finances?

20:40.673 --> 20:44.376
He's great, but after everything
that happened with Teddy

20:44.377 --> 20:46.344
and all the cops I know
who go out and break up

20:46.345 --> 20:47.846
and then still have
to work together,

20:47.847 --> 20:49.281
it's just too messy.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.283
I've got a new rule:
I don't date cops.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.785
Cool. Cool.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.854
Yeah, actually, that's funny.
I have the same rule.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.255
No more cops.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.391
From this point on,
it's strictly dating criminals.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.959
If you break up with them,

21:00.960 --> 21:02.561
you can always send them
to jail forever.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.229
Exactly, nice and clean.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.431
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

21:06.432 --> 21:08.433
Hey, I got an email
from the commissioner's office

21:08.434 --> 21:09.467
about our case.

21:09.468 --> 21:10.535
What did they say?

21:10.536 --> 21:11.536
[sheep bleating]

21:11.537 --> 21:14.439
Ahh!
Ahh. Ah-ha.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.540
You got me with my thing.

21:15.541 --> 21:16.541
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.576
Oh!
