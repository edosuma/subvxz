00:02.069 --> 00:07.005
♪ ♪

00:49.683 --> 00:51.049
Mr. Denison,
how does it feel

00:51.085 --> 00:53.285
To receive
the joseph skratz award?

00:53.287 --> 00:56.021
Absolutely wonderful.
Thank you!

00:56.090 --> 01:00.358
In many ways, skratz and I
are one and the same.

01:00.394 --> 01:04.496
Skratz was a pioneer,
a journalist with gumption,

01:04.498 --> 01:07.532
Dead set on taking down
the corruption in this city.

01:07.568 --> 01:11.570
With my cartoons,
I dare to carry on his legacy.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.039
That's why they call me

01:14.108 --> 01:16.708
The most hated
man in toronto.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.277
[laughter and applause]

01:19.313 --> 01:21.580
The ego of that man.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.381
Comparing himself to skratz.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.783
Thank you for
inviting me to this.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.518
As I recall,
you invited yourself.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.388
Well, when you mentioned
it at volleyball,

01:29.523 --> 01:31.657
I thought what
a perfect opportunity

01:31.659 --> 01:34.392
To pursue funding
for the women's clinic.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.328
Relentless as
always, doctor.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.429
I prefer pleasantly
persuasive.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.133
Who will be your
first victim?

01:41.268 --> 01:43.402
Councilman rekker
from the board of control.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.671
Rumour has it he's
an easy sell.

01:45.806 --> 01:46.838
Good. Wish me luck.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.612
Mr. Rekker?
It's wonderful to meet you.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.281
Oh! Charmed.
Um, who may you be?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.616
Dr. Julia ogden.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.918
Ah! And you're here
to ask me for money.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.587
I'm here to ask you
to change lives.

02:02.722 --> 02:05.023
Fox:
Cherry, did you really publish

02:05.159 --> 02:06.425
That anti-viaduct
drivel yesterday?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.693
Don't start
with me, fox.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.094
You know, for the life of me,
I can't understand

02:09.229 --> 02:10.829
Why you'd be
against progress.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.364
Because some things are
more important than money.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.767
Since when?

02:15.836 --> 02:18.637
You know, that sentimentality
is unbecoming, cherry.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.439
It has nothing
to do with that.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.907
I'm on the side
of the people.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.008
Trying on some
new shoes, are we?

02:25.546 --> 02:27.845
Miss cherry,
who's your friend?

02:27.882 --> 02:30.315
Dr. Julia ogden,
this is kole fox.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.651
Kole fox,
dr. Julia ogden.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.652
How do you do, ma'am?

02:33.721 --> 02:35.120
Charmed, I'm sure.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.922
Fox and I worked together at
skratz's first printing press.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.858
-He was our mentor.
-He's a genius.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.061
The world of journalism hasn't
been the same since he retired.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.329
Is he here today?

02:44.464 --> 02:46.465
He sailed for
kuala lumpur two years ago.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.602
Fox, have you heard anything
from skratz since he left?

02:50.638 --> 02:53.605
The favourite pupil hasn't
even received so much

02:53.641 --> 02:56.341
As a postcard from
her beloved mentor?

02:56.476 --> 02:59.278
I guess he didn't like you
as much as he put on.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.380
[laughs]

03:03.651 --> 03:05.550
What is going on
with you two?

03:05.553 --> 03:06.685
What do you mean?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.153
He likes you.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.787
Don't be daft, julia.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.757
Your wicked cartoons
have ruined my life!

03:14.161 --> 03:15.460
You see what I mean.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.861
You think this
is a joke?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.163
My life is ruined!

03:18.298 --> 03:20.265
Correction,
you've ruined yourself.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.234
Your life would
still be in order

03:22.303 --> 03:23.835
Had you not
been corrupt.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.037
How dare you!

03:28.042 --> 03:29.174
[laughs]

03:29.309 --> 03:30.642
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:30.644 --> 03:34.779
May my tongue be ever sharp
and my pen ever swift.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.715
[laughter and applause]

03:36.784 --> 03:39.584
Make sure to favour
my right side,

03:39.587 --> 03:40.952
It is more flattering.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.656
[groans]

03:44.692 --> 03:45.791
[all gasp]

03:45.926 --> 03:47.192
Oh, goodness.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.328
Mr. Denison?

03:49.463 --> 03:50.729
Dear god!

03:50.798 --> 03:53.432
Mr. Denison? Mr. Denison?

03:53.434 --> 03:56.101
Hold on. Hold on!

04:03.143 --> 04:05.143
-Please step aside.
-He's through here.

04:08.716 --> 04:09.814
Miss cherry.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.287
It seems he was shot
through the neck.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.454
From this angle,
the bullet would have

04:16.523 --> 04:17.989
Nicked his
carotid artery.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.925
And that would explain why
he bled to death so quickly.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.895
Do you know of anyone
who'd have wanted to hurt him?

04:23.897 --> 04:26.298
It would be easier
to ask who didn't.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.833
As denison loved to say,

04:27.968 --> 04:29.935
He was the most
hated man in toronto.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.236
He had a political
cartoon column

04:31.371 --> 04:33.638
In the toronto
sentinel newspaper.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.106
Quite scandalous.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.641
Yes, I know
of that one.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.777
Has toronto all a titter
on a regular basis.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.980
No one has gone in,
or out, since.

04:43.017 --> 04:46.318
So, whoever killed him
is still in this room.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.924
George?

04:52.993 --> 04:54.726
Sir.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.062
Bring them in.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.863
-All of them, sir?
-All of them.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.165
Crabtree:
Sir.

05:07.874 --> 05:11.409
So, it's true.
You're the one in charge.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.945
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

05:14.081 --> 05:15.947
Please, just a moment
of your time.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.149
I have but one question.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.885
Ask the question and I'll decide
whether I answer. Miss...

05:20.921 --> 05:22.820
Miss cassiopeia bright.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.757
How did you get
where you are?

05:25.793 --> 05:27.125
I'm not sure
what you mean.

05:27.161 --> 05:30.762
You are like me, but yet
have achieved all of this.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.364
All of what?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.966
Your job.
Your position.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.568
Hard work.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.937
Things are not so simple
for us. You know that.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.105
I'm not sure I
can help you.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.706
I've worked hard all my life.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.775
A university education,
top marks.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.178
I've opened two businesses,
both have closed.

05:46.313 --> 05:49.046
And yet you have it all.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.517
There must be
something else.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.052
What do you
want from me?

05:54.121 --> 05:57.722
Nothing, I just want to know
how you got what you have.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.991
If you're suggesting that I have
done something nefarious.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.592
I certainly am not.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.595
But now that it's
been mentioned...

06:03.664 --> 06:05.997
I'd be pleased if you
would leave, miss bright.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.534
My mistake.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.346
I'm required to attend
events like this

06:22.383 --> 06:24.149
Due to my position
as city councilor,

06:24.218 --> 06:27.285
So, uh, I presented
awards to the winners.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.352
That's all.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.188
Had you ever met
mr. Denison?

06:30.257 --> 06:31.890
I'd heard of his cartoon,

06:32.025 --> 06:34.159
But I'd never met
him before today.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.028
Were you ever the target
of one of his cartoons?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.930
Of course not.

06:38.932 --> 06:42.167
But a few of my colleagues
have been rightfully lambasted.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.569
What were the effects
of the cartoons?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.904
They destroyed my
construction company.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.640
Denison was targeting me.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.908
Look at this.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.913
Now everybody
believes I cut corners.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.548
A picture is worth
a thousand words.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.185
I've lost all my
government contracts

07:00.187 --> 07:02.320
And I'm not being considered
for the new viaduct project

07:02.356 --> 07:03.721
That's being talked about.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.357
Perhaps you wanted mr. Denison
to feel some of the pain

07:06.393 --> 07:07.658
That you were feeling?

07:07.694 --> 07:10.595
I just wanted to thump him
up a bit, not kill him.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.863
Anyway, I was dragged
to the back of the room

07:11.998 --> 07:13.598
Before I could
even raise a fist.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.733
At any rate
the bad blood

07:15.769 --> 07:16.868
Between the two
of you was clear.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.271
An occasional dust up
between colleagues, at most.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.538
We work for the same
publication,

07:20.607 --> 07:21.740
Which his father owned.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.608
So, you had no reason
to want him dead?

07:23.743 --> 07:26.678
Of course not.
Crying shame, this business.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.946
You know, he may have
been a rich blowhard,

07:28.015 --> 07:29.213
But I admired his work.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.616
He was a clever chap
who never backed down.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.251
You respected him?

07:33.253 --> 07:34.685
I wouldn't say that.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.087
I didn't know
the man at all.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.356
I was sent by my publisher
to cover the function

07:38.392 --> 07:40.291
And that's the long
and short of it.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.793
You're both journalists.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.028
He's a cartoonist.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.163
Still... You two
really have never met?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.565
I've never laid eyes on
him before in my life.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.235
So, detective,

07:50.370 --> 07:52.103
Are you going to
arrest me?

07:52.172 --> 07:54.773
No, julia,
this is a formality.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.308
I do have to
follow procedure

07:57.310 --> 07:58.976
And ask you
a few questions.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.845
Of course,
I'd expect no less.

08:00.914 --> 08:04.115
But should I not
be in handcuffs?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.317
Julia.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.988
[both laugh]

08:10.057 --> 08:13.124
Do you recall which direction
the shot came from?

08:13.193 --> 08:16.528
William, I would have
told you at the time.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.730
Why were you
at this event?

08:18.732 --> 08:19.931
I went with miss cherry.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.599
I couldn't pass up
the opportunity

08:21.668 --> 08:23.201
To champion
the women's clinic.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.436
Oh! And?

08:25.506 --> 08:28.340
I was able to get councilman
rekker to agree to help.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.274
-So, a success then?
-Yes.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.477
Well, except for the murder.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.954
Detective watts,
how do you do?

08:43.089 --> 08:44.322
Oh, mr. Strange.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.957
Please, call me milo.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.993
Well, then, feel free
to call me llewellyn.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.028
A magnificent name.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.363
Like a celtic deity
descended upon us.

08:52.399 --> 08:56.701
Oh, I assure you I am
but a bumbling mortal.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.437
I so enjoyed
our last encounter.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.373
We are overdue
for an encore.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.508
Yes, I'm sorry I haven't
gotten back to you.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.842
Things have been busy.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.044
No matter.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.046
Have you heard about
the mahler concert?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.215
-He's touring his....
-7th symphony.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.118
Of course, mahler's
compositions are so rich!

09:13.253 --> 09:14.719
-Romantic.
-Unmatched!

09:14.788 --> 09:16.688
I've been trying to get
tickets for weeks,

09:16.757 --> 09:18.289
But it's impossible.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.858
Well, that settles it.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.793
Would you like
to accompany me?

09:21.928 --> 09:24.429
Absolutely!
I wouldn't miss it.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.931
It's a date.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.405
How's it going, murdoch?

09:34.441 --> 09:36.608
Not much headway,
I'm afraid.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.944
I've sent henry to help george
find the gun and bullet.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.413
-No sign of either?
-Gentlemen.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.782
Bourbon?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.252
Scotch.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.688
Too peaty for me.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.322
I'd take a maker's
over that stuff any day.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.958
I don't like the face
on that one.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.593
A little bit too
sleeky for me.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.366
He is quite
easy on the eyes.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.769
Julia, please. You're like cupid
if cupid was a mosquito.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.704
Murdoch:
Ladies!

10:06.840 --> 10:08.440
Have you finished with
your witness statements?

10:08.575 --> 10:10.775
-Here's mine.
-Very good.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.377
Very good.

10:12.379 --> 10:16.514
Oh! Ms. Cherry, you've
neglected to sign yours.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.683
Oh, bother.
Can I borrow a pen?

10:18.685 --> 10:19.917
Oh!

10:31.098 --> 10:32.664
-There you are.
-I'll see you this evening?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.098
Yes.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.671
Oh! Miss cherry,
you've taken...

10:42.142 --> 10:43.475
Hm.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.877
All right, remember, higgins:

10:45.946 --> 10:48.012
We've got to find
the gun and the bullet,

10:48.081 --> 10:49.414
So look everywhere.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.548
They've got to be
in here somewhere.

10:50.584 --> 10:51.883
Well, this is hopeless.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.752
How are we supposed to find
a tiny bullet in this room?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.352
Just start looking.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.230
You know, higgins,
I was wondering if, uh...

11:06.266 --> 11:09.434
I think I might introduce
effie to my family.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.302
You don't
have a family.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.639
Ah, yes I do!
Higgins, my aunts!

11:14.641 --> 11:16.574
Aren't most of
them on the lam?

11:16.643 --> 11:18.743
Oh, perhaps two of them.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.513
Or perhaps three of them.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.048
I think there's
a warrant out for fern.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.984
Again.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.063
Higgins.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.465
Have a look at this.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.735
"r.S.D. Third."

11:43.870 --> 11:45.570
It belonged
to the victim.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.145
"evening cartoon"
with today's date on it.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.750
It's empty.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.885
This envelope must have
contained the next cartoon

12:01.020 --> 12:02.520
To be published
in the paper.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.155
And somebody stole it?

12:04.157 --> 12:08.292
Possibly mr. Locke to prevent
the cartoonist's next attack.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.495
Do you think he murdered
him to get to the cartoon?

12:10.497 --> 12:11.696
It's a strong
possibility.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.030
Sirs.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.966
There's a new cartoon
in the newspaper.

12:15.101 --> 12:15.967
The missing one?

12:17.771 --> 12:19.103
Very likely.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.372
But that's not
mr. Locke.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.108
It's councilman rekker.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.243
And is that who
I think it is?

12:25.312 --> 12:29.046
Councilman rekker
with mrs. Corinne abbott.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.648
The mayor's wife?

12:30.684 --> 12:32.750
Brackenreid: Bloody hell.
The randy old dog.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.120
Looks like you've got
your prime suspect, murdoch.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.865
Well, I'm here, murdoch.
This better be important.

12:47.934 --> 12:52.103
Councilman, did you know
that you were the target

12:52.105 --> 12:53.738
Of denison's next cartoon?

12:53.807 --> 12:57.074
Of course I didn't know
about this outrage!

12:57.110 --> 12:59.210
I would have stopped it
dead in its tracks.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.945
Strong motive
for murder.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.180
I swear,
as god is my witness,

13:03.216 --> 13:06.351
I had no idea denison was
drawing these lies about me.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.953
And as for you, detective,
I hope you don't believe

13:08.989 --> 13:11.022
This disgusting smut.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.457
I have no opinion
either way.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.758
Well, I can assure you,
my relationship

13:14.795 --> 13:16.227
With mrs. Abbott
has been blown

13:16.362 --> 13:17.962
Entirely out
of proportion.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.230
Do I take this to mean

13:19.266 --> 13:21.432
That there is a certain
degree of truth?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.803
I've had quite enough
of this. I am leaving.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.171
Sir?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.906
Either charge me
or let me go.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.243
I'll be in touch.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.744
With a full apology,
I trust.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.581
And you can tell
your wife I've forgotten

13:36.650 --> 13:38.849
The conversation
we had earlier.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.060
Watts: I spoke with
the publisher of the sentinel.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.130
He claims not to know
where the cartoon came from.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.565
Denison usually walked
them in himself,

13:54.601 --> 13:56.267
But this one
mysteriously showed up

13:56.269 --> 13:58.269
Without anyone
seeing who left it.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.937
Brackenreid: The first copy
of the cartoon was stolen

14:00.072 --> 14:01.272
From denison's satchel
by the killer,

14:01.308 --> 14:03.007
Who then must have
destroyed it.

14:03.009 --> 14:07.144
Which means the publisher
received the second copy.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.779
Question is:
Who left it?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.717
What is it, watts?

14:16.890 --> 14:20.624
Well, inspector,
I find myself in a predicament.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.228
Go on. I'm all ears.

14:24.363 --> 14:29.300
I have plans later
that I'm uncertain about.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.902
What kind of plans?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.536
The mahler symphony.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.306
Marvelous! You should go!
Why wouldn't you?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.108
Well, I'm supposed
to go with a...

14:37.177 --> 14:38.843
New friend.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.180
Oh, no. I don't think
I want to hear about this.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.249
I know.
I understand.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.285
Oh! Just hold
your horses, watts.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.822
You've started.
You might as well finish.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.256
Watts:
Right.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.058
I've been invited to
the mahler symphony,

14:54.193 --> 14:55.460
Which I've been
longing to attend.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.595
However, if I go,

14:58.632 --> 15:01.732
I fear I will give
my friend the wrong idea.

15:01.768 --> 15:04.402
Are you no longer in good
standing with the butcher?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.371
That is precisely
the predicament, inspector.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.006
We are. I am.

15:08.141 --> 15:12.276
I don't want to
seem dishonest.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.146
Well, it it's not a predicament
if it's two friends

15:15.148 --> 15:16.213
With a shared interest.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.215
No funny business
about that.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.218
You're right.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.420
I'm ruminating
excessively.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.888
Just two friends
enjoying a show.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.590
-Two friends.
-No need to worry.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.398
Just don't be
holding hands.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.237
The exit wound from the bullet
is unusually small.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.840
Smallest I've seen.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.542
Have you determined
the diameter?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.310
Exactly six
millimeters.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.446
These wounds should
be much larger.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.649
I'll need my twine.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.321
I think I know
where this is going.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.892
We know that the entry
wound was lower

16:01.027 --> 16:03.327
Than the exit wound,
therefore the bullet

16:03.396 --> 16:06.263
Travelled on an
upward trajectory.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.872
Which means...

16:16.543 --> 16:18.976
It would have
gone roughly...

16:20.280 --> 16:21.278
Here.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.582
Ah.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.622
And there it is.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.857
-Well, I'll be!
-That's an odd colour.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.225
Look at that.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.695
Right, then.

16:41.401 --> 16:44.301
Based on the trajectory
that we've established,

16:44.371 --> 16:45.837
Henry, pull it tight.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.304
Hmm, no, lower.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.576
We know that the shot came
from this side of the room.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.648
It was held waist high,
as to conceal the weapon,

16:57.650 --> 17:00.184
And aimed upward.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.521
Sir, there is somebody else
in the photograph.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.789
Could it be this man?

17:04.924 --> 17:05.890
Let me see that.

17:08.828 --> 17:09.960
Well, no, george.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.829
That person was on
the other side of the camera.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.198
Wait.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.137
[inaudible speaking]

17:19.272 --> 17:20.838
That's councilman rekker.

17:20.907 --> 17:25.009
So, the shooter was on
this side of the room,

17:25.144 --> 17:27.478
But rekker was
on this side?

17:27.514 --> 17:28.513
Murdoch:
Correct, george.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.580
Based on his location

17:29.715 --> 17:31.215
And the fact that
we can see his hands,

17:31.350 --> 17:33.884
There's no way rekker
could have taken the shot.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.024
What are you doing?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.094
Minding my business.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.828
You're following me.

17:46.365 --> 17:47.765
Only because I have
another question.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.168
I didn't take you for
the type to ask just one.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.906
May I take
you to lunch?

17:54.908 --> 17:56.174
You can't afford me.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.842
Well, then, you shall
take me to lunch.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.042
And why should
I do that?

17:59.079 --> 18:01.112
I want you
to mentor me.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.448
I want to become something,
someone important,

18:04.517 --> 18:05.850
Someone like you.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.918
I'm sorry, miss bright.
I can't help you.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.187
It's hard enough
for me as it is.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.957
Yes.
It is hard for us all.

18:13.026 --> 18:15.660
I'm sorry to bother you.

18:17.964 --> 18:18.963
Fine.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.866
Get in.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.834
A start, I suppose.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.479
So, miss bright,
tell me about yourself.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.813
Where do you come from?

18:36.850 --> 18:40.351
Halifax.
Africville, to be exact.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.353
And you?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.355
Here and there.
Everywhere.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.034
What have you got, murdoch?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.370
It's a chromatogram, sir.

18:59.505 --> 19:01.572
-It was invented by the late...
-Just tell me what you're doing.

19:03.443 --> 19:07.445
I am separating
the plant pigments

19:07.580 --> 19:09.980
Present in this solution.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.551
It has separated
itself into green,

19:13.686 --> 19:16.020
Yellow and orange,

19:16.089 --> 19:18.389
A trait
indicative of ink.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.057
Why are you
testing for ink?

19:20.126 --> 19:23.060
That is what was coating
this bullet, sir.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.662
Burnt on.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.930
Strange.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.798
How would ink
get onto a bullet?

19:27.867 --> 19:32.469
Perhaps the killer dipped it
in ink as a symbolic gesture?

19:32.539 --> 19:35.405
He who lives by the pen
dies by the pen?

19:35.441 --> 19:36.674
Something like that.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.742
It was also filed
into a very sharp point

19:38.811 --> 19:40.678
For maximum penetration.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.746
My guess is
the weapon used

19:42.782 --> 19:45.216
Would have been
also quite small.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.017
Then perhaps
not a gun at all.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.429
-Here.
-Councilman rekker!

20:00.800 --> 20:03.267
Is now a good time to
finalize that funding?

20:03.269 --> 20:05.168
Why should I help you?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.370
Oh!

20:06.439 --> 20:09.207
Well, because there are
thousands of underserved women

20:09.342 --> 20:10.841
In this city
who deserve care

20:10.910 --> 20:12.309
And because you
are a councilman

20:12.378 --> 20:14.912
Dedicated to making
a difference and because,

20:14.914 --> 20:16.780
Well, you did say...

20:16.816 --> 20:19.416
Well, it doesn't matter now.
I've been ousted!

20:19.418 --> 20:20.418
Ousted?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.219
Fired from
the board of control!

20:22.222 --> 20:24.989
Oh! Ah, I'm so
sorry councilman.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.124
Ah, I don't know
what to say.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.659
Well, if you're still
in pursuit of funding,

20:28.794 --> 20:30.261
You'll have to take it up
with councilman toplin,

20:30.396 --> 20:32.129
My replacement.

20:32.131 --> 20:35.132
And good luck getting one
red cent out of that tightwad.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.707
Higgins: George,
you'll have to see this.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.475
Rekker could
not have successfully

20:44.610 --> 20:46.410
Made the shot from
where he was standing.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.746
Still, I'm not convinced
he wasn't involved somehow.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.881
So, councilman rekker's
been fired

20:51.017 --> 20:52.483
And replaced with toplin.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.752
Toplin didn't even want to hear
about the women's clinic,

20:54.821 --> 20:56.687
So I guess I'm back
to square one.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.489
Of course he
would be fired.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.957
Well, you don't consort
with your boss's wife

21:00.092 --> 21:02.460
And then just skip back
into work on a Monday morning.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.395
Crabtree:
He won't like that. Ah!

21:04.530 --> 21:06.630
He looks fat and drunk.

21:09.168 --> 21:11.569
Higgins:
Oh, they're coming.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.636
What are you lot up to?

21:12.705 --> 21:13.904
Crabtree:
Sir, you may want to see this.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.639
Or you may not.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.840
Another cartoon.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.842
How is this possible?

21:18.844 --> 21:20.111
Hold on, that's us.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.579
And he's making us
look like fools.

21:21.714 --> 21:25.248
Well, it seems our
cartoonist is still alive.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.258
Why am I in it?
I've barely touched this case.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.960
Guilt by association,
I suppose.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.263
I still don't understand
why the cartoonist

21:39.265 --> 21:41.198
Wanted to get rid of
rekker in the first place.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.667
I wonder if it has to do
with the upcoming vote

21:43.670 --> 21:45.269
On the bloor
street bridge?

21:47.206 --> 21:48.873
Well, go on, higgins!

21:48.875 --> 21:51.641
Well, it's to run from rosedale
to the other side of the don.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.678
Ruthie's women's group
have been up in arms

21:53.813 --> 21:55.880
Over the possibility of losing
their riverside picnic spot.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.684
In any case, a new cartoon
must mean one of three things:

22:00.753 --> 22:03.220
Either denison
isn't really dead,

22:03.256 --> 22:06.424
Or we have
a copy-cat cartoonist,

22:06.426 --> 22:10.627
Or denison was never
the real cartoonist at all.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.763
This is one
of denison's cartoons

22:12.799 --> 22:14.631
Drawn while he
was still alive.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.970
Ah, I knew it!

22:20.039 --> 22:22.305
Both of these drawings
were penned by the same hand.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.908
Sir, how can you tell?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.342
You see that?

22:27.814 --> 22:31.649
It is a calling card hidden
in each of the drawings.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.652
A symbol that brands
the cartoons.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.387
Ah! Wait a second!

22:36.522 --> 22:38.189
He's got me holding
a bottle of scotch.

22:38.324 --> 22:41.725
Sir, are you not often
holding a bottle of scotch?

22:41.761 --> 22:44.061
I know exactly
who the cartoonist is.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.329
It's fox!

22:45.398 --> 22:47.398
Well, how can
you be sure, sir.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.933
Many people know
you drink scotch.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.535
I know what I know,
murdoch.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.003
No one makes fun
of my station house

22:53.005 --> 22:54.471
And gets away with it!

22:55.942 --> 22:57.140
Ask for more,
you got nothing to lose.

23:02.748 --> 23:04.348
You think you're
clever, don't you?

23:04.483 --> 23:06.049
I do.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.551
I know you're
the cartoonist!

23:07.686 --> 23:09.019
Am I?

23:09.055 --> 23:11.622
You and denison were pals,
worked at the same publication.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.824
It would have been easy to feed
him the cartoons every day.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.326
Lots of people work
at the toronto sentinel.

23:15.461 --> 23:18.095
Then how do you explain
the scotch in the drawing!

23:18.097 --> 23:19.463
Accuracy?

23:19.465 --> 23:21.098
What's going on,
inspector?

23:21.167 --> 23:23.900
Someone other than
denison drew this cartoon.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.570
Probably did
the others, as well.

23:26.639 --> 23:30.040
I hardly think mr. Fox
is clever enough for that.

23:35.114 --> 23:38.149
Llewelyn!
Is that a silk ascot?

23:38.284 --> 23:41.251
Oh, well, I thought
I would get dressed up,

23:41.287 --> 23:44.455
But, clearly, I'm the one
who is underdressed.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.289
Oh, don't mind me.
You look great!

23:48.727 --> 23:50.594
So, do you have
the tickets?

23:50.729 --> 23:52.362
-Nope.
-What?

23:52.398 --> 23:54.297
-I thought you said...
-I have a different plan.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.666
What's the plan?

23:55.735 --> 23:57.601
I'm a regular at the theatre
and it just so happens

23:57.736 --> 24:00.070
That one of my top lads
works as a stagehand

24:00.106 --> 24:02.539
And will leave
the side door open for us.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.374
Should we
be doing that?

24:04.444 --> 24:07.211
It feels illegal.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.880
Are you a police officer
or something?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.848
Have a little fun.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.122
Is this something
you do often?

24:19.192 --> 24:20.624
I make things work.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.093
Besides, where's the fun
in going in the front?

24:23.095 --> 24:25.296
This way is much more
of a challenge.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.698
I do love a challenge.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.235
Quickly now.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.042
Coming to my home truly
crosses the line, detective.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.644
You refused to come
into the station house, sir.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.246
For everyone to revel
in my humiliation?

24:42.381 --> 24:43.314
No, thank you.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.315
You cannot impede a police...
[crashes]

24:45.384 --> 24:47.584
Police investigation
in this way.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.287
[loud crash]

24:50.323 --> 24:52.289
Is everything all right, sir?

24:52.425 --> 24:53.791
Woman: How dare you
do this to me?

24:53.793 --> 24:56.861
My wife saw the cartoon.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.662
[loud crash]

24:58.797 --> 25:01.598
She's displeased.

25:01.734 --> 25:06.069
Ah... My sympathies
to your wife.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.205
Woman: He always thought
you were a worthless scoundrel

25:08.340 --> 25:10.140
Below my standing!

25:10.209 --> 25:12.809
Sir, do you know who might
want you out of your position?

25:12.879 --> 25:15.479
In that den of vipers?
Who knows?

25:15.548 --> 25:17.614
Could your ousting have
something to do with

25:17.650 --> 25:19.683
Your vote on
the bloor street viaduct?

25:21.854 --> 25:23.554
I have no idea.

25:23.556 --> 25:25.789
Well, sir, I looked
into your voting record,

25:25.791 --> 25:28.858
And you were for the bridge
up until two months ago.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.429
What made you
flip your vote?

25:32.431 --> 25:34.765
Councilmen switch
their votes all the time.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.101
We are voting on behalf of
our constituents, after all.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.104
You represent riverdale.

25:40.239 --> 25:43.173
Why would your constituents
not want easy access

25:43.242 --> 25:45.308
To the rest of the city
via a bridge?

25:48.347 --> 25:51.648
It's almost as if you had
incentive to change your vote.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.588
Are you accusing me
of something, detective?

25:57.723 --> 25:59.723
Well, something made
you change your mind.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.258
Was it a bribe?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.327
And what proof do
you have of this?

26:03.462 --> 26:05.462
It's easy enough to
find out, councilman.

26:05.464 --> 26:07.731
We would just pull
your financial records.

26:07.733 --> 26:11.135
But I don't want
to do this.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.404
I have a killer to catch.

26:13.539 --> 26:16.673
And to do so,
I need your cooperation.

26:19.845 --> 26:23.347
I may have taken a small
token of appreciation

26:23.349 --> 26:25.482
For my vote
against the bridge.

26:25.518 --> 26:28.485
My replacement,
toplin, is pro-bridge.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.420
It'll pass anyway.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.356
Who bribed you?

26:35.861 --> 26:37.628
I don't know.

26:37.763 --> 26:41.231
The request came
in writing, anonymously.

26:41.233 --> 26:45.302
The money was
delivered and so I...

26:45.371 --> 26:46.303
Acceded.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.306
Murdoch:
With councilman rekker out,

26:50.343 --> 26:53.110
The referendum on the
bloor street viaduct will pass.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.511
Meaning what?

26:54.647 --> 26:57.448
Well, sir, this could be
the motive for this murder.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.516
Whoever killed the
cartoonist does not want

26:59.651 --> 27:01.151
This bridge to be built.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.452
Brackenreid:
Why?

27:02.488 --> 27:04.188
He doesn't want people from
the other side of the river

27:04.323 --> 27:05.455
Coming into town?

27:05.491 --> 27:06.923
Possibly.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.125
But more likely, perhaps,
is that the killer

27:09.161 --> 27:11.928
Has a vested interest
in protecting something

27:11.998 --> 27:14.798
That building this
bridge would demolish.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.000
Well, they'd have to
tear down these buildings

27:17.069 --> 27:18.535
To build the bridge.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.203
Who owns them?

27:20.205 --> 27:22.106
I've sent george
to look into it.

27:22.108 --> 27:25.508
Perhaps one of these buildings
is the key to this entire thing.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.514
Come on!

27:30.516 --> 27:31.681
You two, stop!

27:36.188 --> 27:38.021
[both laugh]

27:41.894 --> 27:43.560
Who knew watching
the symphony from the wings

27:43.629 --> 27:44.695
Would be so lovely?

27:44.697 --> 27:46.363
Oh! Being that close
to the orchestra.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.166
It almost gives the sound
an ethereal quality.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.502
I could practically
feel the music inside me.

27:51.504 --> 27:54.371
Well, you were standing
right next to the bass drum.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.639
I will no longer watch
a symphony any other way.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.710
Too bad the stage
manager caught us.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.111
I couldn't believe
my ears when you said

28:01.246 --> 28:02.446
That we should
run for it.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.249
There is a fun side
to you after all, detective.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.118
Well, would have been
a difficult task

28:08.253 --> 28:10.254
To explain to the men
from the station house

28:10.389 --> 28:12.122
When they showed up.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.991
But it was worth it.

28:14.126 --> 28:17.127
The symphony
was magnificent.

28:17.262 --> 28:18.328
Ah, pish!

28:18.364 --> 28:20.330
We can't live on
a half-finished symphony.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.931
It's blasphemy!

28:21.933 --> 28:23.066
The philharmonic will
be back in new york

28:23.135 --> 28:24.801
In a matter of weeks.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.470
Let us go catch
the rest down there.

28:26.539 --> 28:30.340
Oh. That's a lovely idea.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.611
Until next time.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.112
Toodaloo.

28:48.694 --> 28:50.160
So what's all this, then?

28:50.196 --> 28:52.362
Sirs, I think
I've cracked it.

28:52.364 --> 28:55.165
By all means, george,
go right ahead.

28:55.201 --> 28:56.966
Crabtree: Well, I went down
to the land registry,

28:57.002 --> 29:00.304
And I found out which buildings
would need to be torn down

29:00.306 --> 29:02.572
Should the bloor street
viaduct go through.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.107
There are four in total.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.110
Do any of the owners
oppose the project?

29:06.245 --> 29:07.444
Funny you
should ask, sir.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.346
Three of them sold
up quite quickly,

29:09.481 --> 29:11.581
But the fourth has been
a real stickler.

29:11.617 --> 29:14.884
There is serious opposition
to tearing this building down.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.193
I'm here.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.828
Good for you.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.263
What do you
need from me?

29:26.265 --> 29:27.931
Constable crabtree
asked me to come in.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.867
Do I look like
constable crabtree?

29:30.002 --> 29:34.470
It houses a small, out of
commission printing press.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.472
Who owns it?

29:35.607 --> 29:36.606
You're not going to
believe this, sir.

29:36.675 --> 29:39.209
It's owned by
joseph skratz.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.678
The man after which
mr. Denison's award was named?

29:41.747 --> 29:42.879
Crabtree:
One and the same, sir.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.081
Now, this building was
slated to be bought

29:45.151 --> 29:46.784
And demolished months ago.

29:46.919 --> 29:47.951
Why wasn't it?

29:47.953 --> 29:50.486
It was saved, sir,
by a petition.

29:50.523 --> 29:51.855
Who started
this petition?

29:51.891 --> 29:54.757
It was started by the very
person who used to work

29:54.794 --> 29:56.360
For joseph skratz.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.128
He's right there.
I'll just go in.

29:58.263 --> 30:00.898
Well, you can't just walk
into the inspector's office.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.232
I'm sure george
will be right out.

30:04.637 --> 30:08.171
Say, you don't have any ink
or a pen to spare, do you?

30:08.174 --> 30:09.906
I need to finish filling
out these sweepstakes.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.375
Sweepstakes?

30:11.510 --> 30:12.910
You can win
a lot of money.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.245
It's not 20 questions,
crabtree. Get on with it!

30:15.314 --> 30:18.515
Sirs...
It's louise cherry.

30:18.584 --> 30:22.185
Sirs!
It's louise cherry.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.259
This one
doesn't work, either.

30:30.261 --> 30:32.062
Guess you won't be
a millionaire after all.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.876
What is happening
with this thing?

30:47.913 --> 30:50.080
[gunshot explodes]

30:50.082 --> 30:51.448
Bloody hell.

30:53.151 --> 30:54.217
Good lord!

30:57.289 --> 30:58.388
What was that?
What happened?

31:00.960 --> 31:03.293
Well, it appears we've
found our murder weapon.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.505
The ink coating the bullet
that killed mr. Denison

31:15.641 --> 31:19.309
Is a match for the ink
found in this pen gun.

31:19.444 --> 31:22.579
That wasn't my pen.
I've never seen it before.

31:22.714 --> 31:26.249
How did it come to be found
in your satchel, miss cherry?

31:41.267 --> 31:43.266
Who knows where
pens come from?

31:43.268 --> 31:47.404
I need a pen,
I see a pen, I take a pen.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.674
You're telling me
you just take pens?

31:50.743 --> 31:52.843
I lose more
than I take.

31:52.845 --> 31:55.345
I take a pen from someone,
someone takes a pen from me.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.281
Just now I gave
constable higgins a pen.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.082
I don't expect it back.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.818
The universe will
provide me with a new pen

32:01.887 --> 32:03.219
When I need one.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.956
I can't believe my ears.

32:05.958 --> 32:09.626
It's the natural order
of things, like umbrellas.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.628
Umbrell... Oh!

32:13.232 --> 32:16.232
Miss cherry, how do you
explain this petition?

32:16.268 --> 32:20.170
I created the petition
to save my dear mentor's

32:20.239 --> 32:22.105
First printing press.

32:22.141 --> 32:25.308
I had my first job
in that building.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.243
Is that why you
advocated against

32:27.313 --> 32:28.778
The building
of the bridge?

32:28.814 --> 32:31.982
My journalistic position
and my personal opinion

32:32.117 --> 32:34.550
Are completely
different things.

32:34.586 --> 32:38.655
The city just decided to
rebuild the queen street bridge

32:38.790 --> 32:40.590
And now they're going
to disrupt everyone's lives

32:40.592 --> 32:42.392
To build another one
on bloor street!

32:42.394 --> 32:44.528
Well, between
theft and murder,

32:44.663 --> 32:46.396
Things aren't looking very
good for you, miss cherry.

32:48.867 --> 32:52.135
Why on earth would I give
constable higgins a pen

32:52.171 --> 32:53.970
If I thought
it were a gun?

32:57.609 --> 33:00.777
Now, if you're not
prepared to arrest me,

33:00.779 --> 33:02.612
I'd like to leave.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.114
I'm a very busy woman.

33:04.249 --> 33:07.316
There seems to be
a misunderstanding, miss cherry.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.687
You were part of a very
small group of individuals

33:10.822 --> 33:13.490
Present when
mr. Denison was murdered.

33:13.559 --> 33:16.693
And you were in possession
of the murder weapon.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.163
You are very much
under arrest.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.580
You must love this,
george.

33:36.582 --> 33:37.914
Uh, hardly.

33:37.916 --> 33:40.316
Unlike yourself, miss cherry,
I don't take pleasure

33:40.352 --> 33:41.984
In other people's
discomfort.

33:42.021 --> 33:45.055
And I certainly don't
take their umbrellas.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.656
[sighs]

33:46.692 --> 33:47.857
Crabtree:
Come with me.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.671
The pen is
circumstantial at best.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.740
The killer could have
slipped it into her bag.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.675
Or she just
happened to steal it.

34:05.811 --> 34:09.345
In any case, her connection
to skratz's house

34:09.415 --> 34:11.548
Seems hardly enough
to kill someone over.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.084
Well, there's got to
be more to it, then.

34:14.086 --> 34:17.087
Maybe the answer
is the building.

34:17.222 --> 34:18.221
I'll get my hat.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.296
Right, george.

34:26.365 --> 34:28.632
Look for anything
that ties to miss cherry.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.233
Why the fuss
over this place?

34:30.302 --> 34:31.701
It's clearly
been abandoned.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.570
Oh, I don't know.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.638
Look at this.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.040
For a place
that's been abandoned

34:38.077 --> 34:39.775
It seems someone's
been here recently.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.981
Wonder if this
is skratz' old desk?

34:52.825 --> 34:54.858
George? George?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.662
These floorboards
are out of order.

34:58.797 --> 34:59.930
How can you tell?

35:00.065 --> 35:01.598
Look at
this ink stain.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.533
It's as if someone
pried the boards up

35:03.668 --> 35:06.803
And placed them
again out of order.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.125
Crabtree:
Oh, my god.

35:32.498 --> 35:35.365
Well, it appears we now know
the import of this building.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.179
Mr. Joseph skratz.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.685
Kuala lumpur.

35:57.255 --> 35:59.755
I suppose he never made it
on to that steamship after all.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.594
This is the missing piece,
george: The motive.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.797
This is why miss cherry would
kill to protect this place.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.267
To protect her secret.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.336
She killed them both.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.074
Mr. Watts!

36:18.143 --> 36:19.609
You seem in better
spirits today.

36:19.744 --> 36:21.143
Thank you for your
advice, inspector.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.946
I went and had
a wonderful time.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.080
Glad to hear it.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.215
On your way to
the station?

36:25.350 --> 36:27.617
I'll be along in a minute,
I have one last stop.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.686
Ah! Sustenance.
Good idea.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.020
-One, please.
-See you there.

36:31.089 --> 36:32.422
Yes.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.224
Thank you.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.705
Do you really think she could
have done this, murdoch?

36:48.840 --> 36:49.906
Killed two people?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.774
It is somewhat
out of character.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.311
Out of character, sir?
The woman steals pens!

36:54.446 --> 36:56.446
-George.
-And umbrellas!

36:56.515 --> 36:57.581
What kind of a maniac

36:57.716 --> 36:59.849
Takes another person's
umbrella on a rainy day?

36:59.851 --> 37:02.918
I'll tell you what kind,
the criminally inclined.

37:02.955 --> 37:05.388
[higgins chuckling]

37:05.390 --> 37:06.389
What are you laughing at,
higgins?

37:06.458 --> 37:07.590
Let me have a look.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.725
Sir, perhaps
you'd rather not.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.059
Give it to me.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.997
Another bloody cartoon.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.465
Oh, this isn't good.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.134
Every single person we suspect
in this investigation

37:18.136 --> 37:20.269
Has been exposed.

37:20.271 --> 37:23.139
Including dr. Ogden
and louise cherry.

37:23.208 --> 37:25.041
We need to solve
this, quickly.

37:28.914 --> 37:33.416
The calling card
reminds me of lc.

37:50.135 --> 37:51.501
Come back here!

37:59.711 --> 38:00.676
Ha!

38:03.782 --> 38:04.914
Come back, you!

38:07.986 --> 38:09.151
I've got you!

38:19.998 --> 38:22.732
When did you
kill mr. Skratz?

38:22.768 --> 38:25.134
Two years ago.

38:25.203 --> 38:27.403
Why?

38:27.472 --> 38:29.539
He found out I
plagiarized articles.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.140
I would have been
blackballed in the industry

38:31.209 --> 38:33.142
And lost everything.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.413
So, you killed him?

38:36.548 --> 38:39.215
Skratz never cared
about me, anyway.

38:39.284 --> 38:42.151
He adored louise,
she was his favourite.

38:42.187 --> 38:43.620
And when he threatened
to end my career,

38:43.755 --> 38:45.088
That was the last straw.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.622
So, you buried him
under the floorboards

38:46.692 --> 38:48.091
And left him to rot?

38:48.093 --> 38:49.358
What was I to do?

38:49.394 --> 38:50.493
He was retiring to malaysia,

38:50.628 --> 38:52.161
And he'd already
bought his tickets.

38:52.230 --> 38:54.163
And with no next of kin,
when he disappeared,

38:54.199 --> 38:56.299
There would be no one
to ask questions.

38:56.301 --> 38:59.169
I simply took control of
his finances to ensure

38:59.304 --> 39:01.504
The building was not sold
and wrote the occasional

39:01.540 --> 39:03.639
Wanderlust article
under skratz' name

39:03.709 --> 39:05.375
For a travel magazine.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.977
Nobody was ever the wiser.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.550
What about this cartoonist?

39:19.024 --> 39:21.991
Everything was fine until
that bridge nonsense came up.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.695
Demolishing the building
would have revealed the body.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.064
Is that when you returned
to the skratz building?

39:28.133 --> 39:31.334
We found evidence that
someone had been there recently.

39:31.336 --> 39:34.003
I tried to move the body,
but it was too decomposed,

39:34.039 --> 39:35.872
Impossible to move.

39:35.941 --> 39:40.343
So, I bribed rekker,
and everything was going to plan

39:40.345 --> 39:42.945
Until those ludicrous
cartoons blew it all up.

39:43.014 --> 39:47.150
How did you come to find
out that the rekker cartoon

39:47.219 --> 39:49.352
Was next on the docket?

39:49.421 --> 39:51.554
That scum,
councilman toplin,

39:51.623 --> 39:53.356
Came to me with
the rumour first.

39:53.491 --> 39:56.425
He wanted me to publish
an article to take down rekker

39:56.461 --> 39:58.828
So he could replace him
at the board of control.

39:58.963 --> 40:02.031
Naturally,
you refused.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.701
I knew he'd take it elsewhere.
I just didn't know where.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.769
That is until
that idiot, denison,

40:06.805 --> 40:08.705
Boasted about it to me.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.042
So, you killed
him for it.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.411
Obviously.

40:17.249 --> 40:20.984
I should've known
louise cherry was behind this.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.452
She's been chasing
me my whole life.

40:23.488 --> 40:27.857
Well, it seems she's
finally caught you, mr. Fox.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.331
You are free to go,
miss cherry.

40:35.367 --> 40:37.733
We're taking it easy on you
this time but be warned:

40:37.735 --> 40:40.270
We won't be tolerating
any more thefts.

40:40.272 --> 40:42.271
Whatever you say,
constable.

40:42.307 --> 40:43.940
Sign this,
you can be on your way.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.613
Can I borrow a pen?

40:53.618 --> 40:55.251
What?

40:55.320 --> 40:58.787
You confiscated the rest
of my pens, remember?

41:13.638 --> 41:16.138
Your mark will do.
Good day, miss cherry.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.917
I just can't believe it.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.519
Joseph skratz is dead,

41:29.654 --> 41:31.788
And fox is the one
who killed him.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.389
I'm so sorry.

41:33.391 --> 41:36.192
As much as we fought,
I thought I knew him, at least.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.727
Indeed.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.396
It seems he was hiding
quite the darkness.

41:40.532 --> 41:44.534
I daresay it will be my last
venture into matchmaking.

41:44.536 --> 41:46.135
It's not you.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.737
I have terrible
luck with men.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.006
If he had've known you
were the cartoonist,

41:50.075 --> 41:52.608
It would have been
your neck on the line.

41:52.743 --> 41:54.944
Poor mr. Denison.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.347
He was always up
for some fun.

41:57.482 --> 41:59.515
How did the two
of you meet?

41:59.650 --> 42:02.552
We met at an
event years ago.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.621
He was so bored
with high society

42:04.623 --> 42:07.690
And disgusted with the people
in his social circle.

42:07.825 --> 42:09.892
So, I came up with a plan
to take them down.

42:09.928 --> 42:13.629
Before we knew it,
we had a huge following.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.298
So, he was just
the face of it.

42:15.367 --> 42:16.632
Exactly.

42:16.668 --> 42:19.368
I drew the cartoons and he
got to shake the city.

42:19.437 --> 42:20.837
He loved it.

42:20.839 --> 42:23.172
So, why pretend that
he's the cartoonist?

42:23.308 --> 42:25.341
The cartoons were
based on rumours.

42:25.377 --> 42:28.577
If I published them
in any official capacity,

42:28.613 --> 42:31.714
It could compromise my
journalistic integrity.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.984
Still, it's a shame
you couldn't get any glory.

42:35.119 --> 42:36.852
I'm not in it
for the glory.

42:39.958 --> 42:41.991
Miss bright.
Back again?

42:42.126 --> 42:44.126
Am I to take you
to lunch every day?

42:44.195 --> 42:47.730
I should have known
it'd be so easy.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.298
What do you mean?

42:53.572 --> 42:56.072
Did it all
on your own, did you?

42:56.207 --> 42:57.873
You don't know
anything about me.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.876
Oh, I know enough.

43:00.011 --> 43:04.280
You told me hard work
was all it took.

43:04.282 --> 43:06.482
You failed to mention

43:06.484 --> 43:10.019
Marrying a rich,
white man.

43:10.021 --> 43:13.355
And what of it?
I owe you nothing.

43:13.491 --> 43:17.160
I had hoped
for a chance.

43:17.162 --> 43:20.963
But I guess it was
nothing but a fool's errand.

43:22.567 --> 43:24.167
Good day,
miss bright.

43:24.302 --> 43:28.237
It makes me wonder
what other secrets you hold.
