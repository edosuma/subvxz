00:31.496 --> 00:32.531
There is nothing like

00:32.597 --> 00:35.476
going to a theater, a communal

00:35.533 --> 00:37.410
atmosphere, watching something

00:37.468 --> 00:40.005
that is bigger than life.

00:40.071 --> 00:41.550
It's dark...

00:41.606 --> 00:45.110
You don't look at anybody...

00:45.176 --> 00:46.246
And then the movie

00:46.311 --> 00:48.222
started and it was really,

00:48.279 --> 00:49.986
really magical.

00:53.484 --> 00:54.588
I went to a movie at

00:54.652 --> 00:56.290
10 in the morning, which to me

00:56.354 --> 00:57.731
was so odd, right?

00:57.789 --> 00:58.927
Who goes to a movie at 10?

00:58.990 --> 01:00.992
But there was light, there was

01:01.092 --> 01:03.368
drama, there was narrative and I

01:03.394 --> 01:05.670
think what I most loved was the

01:05.730 --> 01:07.573
way the filmmaker was present,

01:07.632 --> 01:09.009
saying "Here, take a look at"

01:09.067 --> 01:11.069
this, think about that."

01:11.135 --> 01:11.943
We were all an

01:12.003 --> 01:13.003
eight-year-old boy.

01:13.004 --> 01:14.813
We were all a 10-year-old girl.

01:14.872 --> 01:16.852
We were all sitting there in

01:16.908 --> 01:18.478
that audience watching whatever

01:18.543 --> 01:20.489
that movie was.

01:20.545 --> 01:21.683
It became a

01:21.746 --> 01:23.020
magical experience.

01:23.081 --> 01:24.617
You go into the dark and you

01:24.682 --> 01:25.962
learn something new and you come

01:26.017 --> 01:27.894
out and it's almost like a

01:27.952 --> 01:30.626
religious experience.

01:30.688 --> 01:32.224
If you want a window into

01:32.290 --> 01:34.668
what was going on in humankind

01:34.726 --> 01:36.000
at a given point in time, you

01:36.060 --> 01:37.061
look at movies.

01:40.965 --> 01:43.343
It gave me the sense that I

01:43.401 --> 01:46.780
was more than just this little

01:46.838 --> 01:49.216
boy, and there was a lot of

01:49.274 --> 01:50.582
other things out there

01:50.642 --> 01:51.643
that I could do.

01:51.709 --> 01:53.586
And if I just kept going in the

01:53.645 --> 01:55.556
right direction, maybe the right

01:55.613 --> 01:56.648
thing would happen.

01:56.714 --> 01:57.920
Because that's what happened

01:57.982 --> 01:59.052
in the movies.

02:16.601 --> 02:17.807
It's heavy.

02:17.869 --> 02:20.008
What is it?

02:23.875 --> 02:25.912
The, uh...

02:25.977 --> 02:28.014
Stuff that dreams are made of.

02:28.079 --> 02:29.752
Huh?

02:31.559 --> 02:32.559
Media giant

02:32.583 --> 02:33.926
Ted Turner has upset a lot of

02:33.985 --> 02:35.464
people because of what he's

02:35.520 --> 02:36.931
doing to some of Hollywood's

02:36.988 --> 02:38.797
greatest old films.

02:38.856 --> 02:40.028
Turner recently bought the.

02:40.091 --> 02:42.093
M.G.M. film library.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.071
Now, he's adding color to the

02:44.128 --> 02:45.436
black and white ones.

02:48.866 --> 02:50.004
To colorize or not

02:50.068 --> 02:52.275
to colorize, Ted Turner has said

02:52.337 --> 02:53.475
is his choice.

02:53.538 --> 02:54.482
Well, last time I checked,

02:54.539 --> 02:55.711
they were my films.

02:55.773 --> 02:56.877
You know, I'm working

02:56.941 --> 02:58.011
on my films.

03:04.482 --> 03:05.688
Let us just say that a very

03:05.750 --> 03:07.127
rich man has purchased all the

03:07.185 --> 03:08.755
films ever made in Hollywood.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.561
He calls together his staff and

03:10.621 --> 03:11.964
says, "take all the black and"

03:12.023 --> 03:13.229
white ones and turn them into

03:13.291 --> 03:15.271
"color, using our new computer."

03:15.326 --> 03:16.304
It was kind of an artists'

03:16.361 --> 03:18.034
rights issue involving material

03:18.096 --> 03:19.336
alteration of film, such as

03:19.397 --> 03:20.740
colorization, panning and

03:20.798 --> 03:22.175
scanning, that sort of thing.

03:22.233 --> 03:23.405
It was a big controversy between

03:23.468 --> 03:24.469
directors who don't like to see

03:24.535 --> 03:26.446
their films changed and studios

03:26.504 --> 03:27.949
who were looking to take, say,

03:28.005 --> 03:28.881
black and white films and

03:28.940 --> 03:29.782
introduce them to a new

03:29.841 --> 03:31.184
generation by, they thought,

03:31.242 --> 03:32.312
colorizing them would make them

03:32.377 --> 03:33.788
more appealing.

03:33.845 --> 03:35.825
Colorization really was the

03:35.880 --> 03:37.826
combustible issue because

03:37.882 --> 03:39.793
a lot of film critics, as well

03:39.851 --> 03:41.125
as the directors and the

03:41.185 --> 03:42.858
cinematographers and the actors

03:42.920 --> 03:44.957
were all so incensed at these

03:45.022 --> 03:46.695
changes, especially the

03:46.758 --> 03:48.965
possibility of changes to,

03:49.026 --> 03:50.596
you know, classic films.

03:50.661 --> 03:52.004
Because the films are a

03:52.063 --> 03:53.940
part of our cultural history,

03:53.998 --> 03:55.477
and like all accurate

03:55.533 --> 03:57.444
representations of who and what

03:57.502 --> 03:59.482
we were, I think they deserve

03:59.570 --> 04:00.878
preservation in their

04:00.905 --> 04:03.181
authentic form.

04:03.241 --> 04:04.241
The committee rooms were

04:04.275 --> 04:05.754
packed and when you get

04:05.810 --> 04:07.653
Jimmy Stewart coming,

04:07.712 --> 04:09.157
you know, Mr. Smith literally

04:09.213 --> 04:10.749
coming to Washington, you know,

04:10.815 --> 04:12.015
I was just sitting there, sort

04:12.016 --> 04:13.893
of admiring the whole scene.

04:13.951 --> 04:15.396
I feel that they're

04:15.453 --> 04:19.492
being tampered with and I... I

04:19.557 --> 04:24.302
want to speak out against this.

04:24.362 --> 04:25.773
The Librarian of Congress got

04:25.830 --> 04:28.834
the idea that if film was

04:28.900 --> 04:32.712
honored in some way by the

04:32.770 --> 04:34.647
national government, that it

04:34.705 --> 04:37.208
would be recognized as having

04:37.275 --> 04:39.653
cultural and artistic value.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.815
Today, the congress is taking

04:41.879 --> 04:44.120
up a bill called the National.

04:44.182 --> 04:45.786
Film Preservation Act.

04:45.850 --> 04:46.954
Congress finally

04:47.018 --> 04:48.258
stepped in and we were kind of

04:48.319 --> 04:49.764
the person brought in to referee

04:49.821 --> 04:50.822
it if we could.

04:50.888 --> 04:52.333
And that was essentially

04:52.390 --> 04:53.698
the creation of the National.

04:53.758 --> 04:55.396
Film Registry.

04:58.606 --> 04:59.606
The National Film.

04:59.630 --> 05:02.304
Registry is a list of films of

05:02.333 --> 05:04.779
enduring cultural, historical

05:04.836 --> 05:06.042
and aesthetic importance,

05:06.103 --> 05:07.810
recommended to the Librarian

05:07.872 --> 05:09.215
of Congress by a very

05:09.273 --> 05:10.684
distinguished board.

05:10.741 --> 05:13.722
25 films are announced each year

05:13.778 --> 05:16.258
as being added to that registry.

05:16.314 --> 05:18.794
1989, the first year

05:18.850 --> 05:22.195
of the board meeting, was very

05:22.253 --> 05:24.392
much focused on the artists'

05:24.455 --> 05:25.798
rights issues.

05:25.857 --> 05:27.859
And then after that, it seemed

05:27.925 --> 05:29.632
very quickly to fade.

05:29.694 --> 05:32.436
The issue became preservation,

05:32.497 --> 05:35.034
and which films should be

05:35.099 --> 05:38.706
awarded the seal of the national

05:38.769 --> 05:40.749
film preservation board.

05:40.805 --> 05:41.875
This process serves

05:41.939 --> 05:43.179
as an invaluable means to

05:43.241 --> 05:44.948
advance public awareness of the

05:45.009 --> 05:46.488
richness and variety of the

05:46.544 --> 05:48.615
American film heritage.

05:48.679 --> 05:50.454
This is not simply just another

05:50.515 --> 05:51.858
list of great films.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.918
It is saying to America

05:53.985 --> 05:55.191
and to the world,

05:55.253 --> 05:56.357
"These films matter."

05:56.420 --> 05:57.091
What the film registry

05:57.154 --> 05:58.154
says is "Here are great"

05:58.189 --> 05:58.860
works of art."

05:58.923 --> 05:59.923
They were created in a

05:59.957 --> 06:01.157
commercial context but we need

06:01.158 --> 06:02.432
to preserve them the way

06:02.493 --> 06:03.836
the metropolitan museum

06:03.895 --> 06:06.239
preserves Leonardo da Vinci's.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.674
One of the nice things about

06:10.735 --> 06:12.373
the National Film Registry is

06:12.436 --> 06:13.847
that it's not only preserving

06:13.905 --> 06:15.714
our films, but it's also, to a

06:15.773 --> 06:16.894
large extent, preserving our

06:16.941 --> 06:18.648
cultural heritage, and all the

06:18.709 --> 06:20.211
things that film capture.

06:27.485 --> 06:28.862
If you look at the advent

06:28.920 --> 06:30.194
of movies from the 1890s

06:30.254 --> 06:32.700
forward, they were in many ways

06:32.757 --> 06:34.202
the most important force for

06:34.258 --> 06:35.669
shaping a common sense of

06:35.726 --> 06:37.000
American culture.

06:37.061 --> 06:38.096
There was a time when people

06:38.162 --> 06:39.163
in Southern California didn't

06:39.230 --> 06:40.072
have much in common with

06:40.131 --> 06:41.235
the people in Maine and the

06:41.299 --> 06:42.744
people in Florida had virtually

06:42.800 --> 06:43.778
nothing in common with the

06:43.834 --> 06:45.745
people in the Pacific Northwest,

06:45.803 --> 06:47.373
and it's movies that came along

06:47.438 --> 06:48.439
that began to create the sense

06:48.506 --> 06:49.814
of nationhood.

06:52.443 --> 06:53.649
The American film was a

06:53.711 --> 06:55.315
particular way in which a young

06:55.379 --> 06:57.484
nation learned to express

06:57.548 --> 06:59.585
itself, express its exuberance,

06:59.684 --> 07:01.459
expose its problems,

07:01.485 --> 07:03.192
reflect its hopes.

07:03.254 --> 07:05.495
It was living history,

07:05.556 --> 07:06.660
audio-visual history

07:06.724 --> 07:07.862
of the 20th century.

07:07.925 --> 07:10.565
Movies have been the document

07:10.628 --> 07:11.971
of our history and culture.

07:12.029 --> 07:13.007
They tell us what we looked

07:13.064 --> 07:15.271
like, what we wore, what we

07:15.333 --> 07:17.313
aspired to, our dreams, the lies

07:17.368 --> 07:18.972
we told to one another...

07:19.036 --> 07:20.344
Because in those

07:20.404 --> 07:21.781
movies are those little gestures

07:21.839 --> 07:23.546
and those little images and

07:23.608 --> 07:25.645
the styles and the ways of

07:25.710 --> 07:26.882
speaking to each other, the way

07:26.944 --> 07:28.423
men spoke to women and women to

07:28.479 --> 07:29.981
women and men to men, and the

07:30.047 --> 07:31.458
way they projected their own

07:31.515 --> 07:32.994
dreams and desires into

07:33.050 --> 07:34.324
narratives and fantasies.

07:34.385 --> 07:36.092
That is what the movies does,

07:36.153 --> 07:37.359
and it does it better than

07:37.421 --> 07:39.162
anything else.

07:42.493 --> 07:44.769
American film really tells us

07:44.829 --> 07:46.331
so much about this country.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.481
When it starts with

07:53.537 --> 07:55.881
storytelling about individuals,

07:55.940 --> 07:59.888
underdogs, immigrants, people

07:59.977 --> 08:04.949
who don't have something.

08:04.982 --> 08:05.892
I saw that film

08:05.950 --> 08:07.395
when I was still in Hong Kong

08:07.451 --> 08:10.728
when I was a teenager.

08:10.788 --> 08:12.233
I think it gave me

08:12.289 --> 08:14.826
a sense of America.

08:14.892 --> 08:16.462
Life can be bright

08:16.527 --> 08:17.972
in America

08:18.029 --> 08:18.803
if you can fight

08:18.863 --> 08:20.274
in America.

08:20.331 --> 08:21.139
Life is all right

08:21.198 --> 08:22.609
in America

08:22.667 --> 08:23.441
if you're all white

08:23.501 --> 08:24.912
in America...

08:24.969 --> 08:25.970
The lyrics to that

08:26.037 --> 08:27.175
song, they're really quite

08:27.238 --> 08:29.013
sarcastic about being an

08:29.073 --> 08:30.518
immigrant in America.

08:30.574 --> 08:32.952
That movie was a huge influence

08:33.010 --> 08:34.683
on me when I was a teenager.

08:34.745 --> 08:36.349
I mean, I probably saw it five

08:36.414 --> 08:38.485
or six times in a row.

08:38.549 --> 08:39.892
I was also in love with

08:39.950 --> 08:40.553
Natalie Wood.

08:40.618 --> 08:42.756
That helped.

08:42.820 --> 08:45.198
You never really understand a

08:45.256 --> 08:46.963
person until you consider things

08:47.024 --> 08:49.163
from his point of view.

08:49.226 --> 08:50.899
Sir?

08:50.961 --> 08:52.099
Till you climb inside of his

08:52.163 --> 08:54.905
skin and walk around in it.

08:54.965 --> 08:58.242
Gregory Peck was kind of what

08:58.302 --> 09:00.179
I thought America was in many

09:00.271 --> 09:01.648
kind of respects.

09:01.672 --> 09:05.415
In this country, our courts

09:05.476 --> 09:07.922
are the great levelers.

09:07.978 --> 09:10.151
In our courts...

09:10.214 --> 09:15.527
All men are created equal.

09:15.586 --> 09:16.894
That's the America that my

09:16.954 --> 09:20.458
father respected most... in that

09:20.524 --> 09:22.401
kind of man that Gregory Peck

09:22.460 --> 09:25.703
was always meant to play.

09:25.763 --> 09:27.868
We identified so strongly with

09:27.932 --> 09:29.468
those kids somehow.

09:29.533 --> 09:30.443
Oh, it's just, like,

09:30.501 --> 09:31.501
instant tears.

09:31.535 --> 09:32.536
It still gets me,

09:32.603 --> 09:34.913
still makes me cry now.

09:34.972 --> 09:35.972
He really portrayed

09:36.006 --> 09:37.542
a father who was just

09:37.608 --> 09:39.178
so understanding and had

09:39.243 --> 09:40.278
such a close relationship

09:40.344 --> 09:42.449
with his kids.

09:42.513 --> 09:44.322
A lot of people would love

09:44.381 --> 09:45.325
to have a father like that.

09:45.382 --> 09:46.382
I mean, who wouldn't?

09:46.383 --> 09:47.555
I would love to have a father

09:47.618 --> 09:49.029
like that.

09:49.086 --> 09:51.032
Many of the characteristics

09:51.088 --> 09:52.158
that my dad portrayed in that

09:52.223 --> 09:54.703
film are really him.

09:54.759 --> 09:56.329
Of all the films that he did,

09:56.393 --> 09:57.770
it was a film that was

09:57.828 --> 10:00.240
closest to his true character,

10:00.297 --> 10:01.867
certainly the character he,

10:01.932 --> 10:02.967
he would want to be.

10:07.037 --> 10:08.072
It's a different form

10:08.139 --> 10:09.379
of honor than getting

10:09.440 --> 10:10.680
an academy award.

10:10.741 --> 10:11.913
It's a more cumulative or

10:11.976 --> 10:14.354
retrospective kind of honor.

10:14.411 --> 10:15.651
It's saying your film has stood

10:15.679 --> 10:16.783
the test of time.

10:16.847 --> 10:17.847
There's never been

10:17.848 --> 10:19.987
a day so sunny

10:20.050 --> 10:23.156
it could not happen twice...

10:23.220 --> 10:25.097
The Academy Awards preserve

10:25.156 --> 10:27.727
the consensus within the

10:27.792 --> 10:29.965
industry at the time.

10:30.027 --> 10:32.701
Sometimes history proves them

10:32.763 --> 10:34.436
right, but very often, history

10:34.498 --> 10:36.171
proves them wrong.

10:36.233 --> 10:37.273
["Also sprach Zarathustra"

10:40.604 --> 10:42.982
Most lists exist nowadays for

10:43.040 --> 10:44.542
pop culture reasons.

10:44.608 --> 10:46.019
It's an excuse for a TV special.

10:46.076 --> 10:48.215
It's to sell magazines.

10:48.279 --> 10:49.280
It's to get people arguing,

10:49.346 --> 10:50.723
and that's what lists do.

10:50.781 --> 10:51.657
The congressional language

10:51.715 --> 10:54.321
setting up the registry was done

10:54.385 --> 10:55.585
by congressional staff back in

10:55.586 --> 10:57.657
1988 and they used "culturally",

10:57.721 --> 10:58.791
historically or aesthetically

10:58.856 --> 11:00.597
"significant," which, we love

11:00.691 --> 11:01.795
that phrase because it basically

11:01.826 --> 11:02.930
means almost anything.

11:02.993 --> 11:03.993
Whoever came up with it,

11:04.028 --> 11:05.166
I forget the person's name,

11:05.229 --> 11:06.708
the staffer, but I'm forever

11:06.764 --> 11:08.038
thankful because it does allow

11:08.098 --> 11:09.702
a lot of leverage in terms

11:09.767 --> 11:11.144
of the sort of films we're able

11:11.202 --> 11:12.545
to pick and put onto the

11:12.603 --> 11:13.673
registry and preserve.

11:16.473 --> 11:18.510
Because of the 10-year rule,

11:18.576 --> 11:20.556
we look at only films that are

11:20.611 --> 11:24.218
10 years old, and that gives us

11:24.281 --> 11:26.557
some space and some time.

11:26.617 --> 11:27.652
And I tell ya what.

11:27.718 --> 11:29.561
From his footprint, he looks

11:29.620 --> 11:34.126
like a big fella.

11:34.191 --> 11:35.431
You see something

11:35.492 --> 11:36.903
down there, chief?

11:36.961 --> 11:38.963
No, I just think

11:39.029 --> 11:40.167
I'm gonna barf.

11:40.231 --> 11:41.335
Why the 10 years?

11:41.398 --> 11:42.398
Why not 50?

11:42.399 --> 11:43.309
Why not five?

11:43.367 --> 11:44.675
Why not one that just opened?

11:44.735 --> 11:46.009
But I suppose it's to have

11:46.070 --> 11:47.048
a little bit of a distance,

11:47.104 --> 11:48.412
which is proper.

11:48.472 --> 11:49.280
Does the film have

11:49.340 --> 11:51.115
a lasting benefit?

11:51.175 --> 11:52.654
Does it stand to history?

11:52.710 --> 11:54.314
The idea is that here is

11:54.378 --> 11:55.982
an arm of the U.S. government

11:56.046 --> 11:57.889
saying that, hey, some films

11:57.948 --> 11:59.018
are important.

11:59.083 --> 12:00.221
They're part of the picture.

12:00.317 --> 12:01.625
So you immediately confer

12:01.652 --> 12:03.256
upon them a certain status

12:03.320 --> 12:04.663
and dignity.

12:04.722 --> 12:05.722
Each year we do try to

12:05.723 --> 12:07.031
fashion an eclectic list,

12:07.091 --> 12:08.798
one that is also stand-alone

12:08.859 --> 12:10.031
on its own merits.

12:10.094 --> 12:11.630
If we pick 25 famous films

12:11.695 --> 12:13.572
one year or 25 films no one

12:13.631 --> 12:14.871
had ever heard of each year,

12:14.932 --> 12:16.138
then the list, to us, would be

12:16.200 --> 12:17.200
a lot less useful.

12:18.269 --> 12:19.407
The way we pick the national

12:19.470 --> 12:20.591
film registry each year is a

12:20.638 --> 12:21.912
multi-stage process.

12:21.972 --> 12:23.042
We start off by soliciting

12:23.107 --> 12:25.417
public balloting.

12:25.476 --> 12:26.978
So we take very seriously

12:27.044 --> 12:28.546
what the public recommends.

12:28.612 --> 12:29.590
They often recommend things that

12:29.647 --> 12:31.320
nobody's even heard of.

12:31.382 --> 12:33.362
We tabulate those results and

12:33.417 --> 12:34.521
send them to the members of the

12:34.585 --> 12:35.962
film preservation board.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.863
Each year a group of

12:37.922 --> 12:39.526
people, representing all areas

12:39.590 --> 12:41.467
of the industry and education

12:41.525 --> 12:43.266
come together and recommend

12:43.327 --> 12:45.034
to the Librarian of Congress

12:45.095 --> 12:47.041
the films of enduring

12:47.097 --> 12:48.701
cultural, historical,

12:48.766 --> 12:50.109
aesthetic importance.

12:50.167 --> 12:51.578
People have their personal

12:51.635 --> 12:54.411
campaigns, their pet films,

12:54.471 --> 12:56.348
their pet causes, and that's

12:56.407 --> 12:58.114
as it should be.

12:58.175 --> 12:59.711
Having gone through the

12:59.810 --> 13:02.484
obvious choices "Citizen Kane",

13:02.513 --> 13:04.550
citizen Kane, citizen Kane...

13:06.450 --> 13:12.059
Rosebud.

13:12.122 --> 13:13.396
Then the less obvious films

13:13.457 --> 13:14.902
come up for discussion,

13:14.959 --> 13:16.239
and that's where the discussions

13:16.293 --> 13:17.328
get interesting.

13:19.163 --> 13:20.163
This was really a good

13:20.197 --> 13:21.904
meeting, and I've been on this

13:21.966 --> 13:24.071
board since its inception.

13:24.134 --> 13:25.442
In the early years, you knew

13:25.502 --> 13:26.640
there were certain kinds of

13:26.704 --> 13:28.149
movies that were the

13:28.205 --> 13:29.650
sprocket-worn classics, the

13:29.707 --> 13:31.414
great films, they would be on

13:31.475 --> 13:33.113
the list, and then you'd put in

13:33.177 --> 13:35.384
a couple more that you hoped

13:35.446 --> 13:36.516
you would expand people's

13:36.580 --> 13:38.526
consciousness about.

13:38.582 --> 13:39.822
It's great to be on the board

13:39.883 --> 13:41.487
because there are so many people

13:41.552 --> 13:43.225
from different aspects of film

13:43.287 --> 13:44.595
and scholarship and everything

13:44.655 --> 13:46.134
related to film, and they bring

13:46.190 --> 13:48.898
up films, you know, that...

13:48.959 --> 13:49.903
I always write them down because

13:49.960 --> 13:51.098
I go, "Oh, I haven't seen this."

13:51.161 --> 13:53.368
I'll have to go see it."

13:53.430 --> 13:54.807
I'm a fairly new

13:54.865 --> 13:56.105
board member.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.474
In the beginning,

13:57.534 --> 13:58.877
it is overwhelming.

13:58.936 --> 14:00.381
There are hundreds of films

14:00.471 --> 14:01.916
that are talked about.

14:01.939 --> 14:03.213
The discussions can range

14:03.273 --> 14:04.809
from being very lighthearted

14:04.875 --> 14:05.751
to very serious.

14:05.809 --> 14:06.981
They have people talking

14:07.044 --> 14:08.921
about home movies, people

14:08.979 --> 14:10.390
talking about newsreels,

14:10.447 --> 14:12.620
people talking about short

14:12.683 --> 14:14.390
films of various kinds.

14:14.451 --> 14:15.657
And it's always one of the

14:15.719 --> 14:17.721
most interesting moments to see

14:17.788 --> 14:20.234
what has been chosen.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.268
And as you go through, you

14:21.325 --> 14:22.861
think, "Well, of course that."

14:22.926 --> 14:23.927
I can't believe it wasn't

14:23.994 --> 14:25.064
"chosen before."

14:25.129 --> 14:26.005
And then you'll come to

14:26.063 --> 14:28.441
something and say, "What?"

14:28.499 --> 14:29.603
'cause this is

14:29.666 --> 14:31.475
thriller

14:31.535 --> 14:33.014
thriller night,

14:33.070 --> 14:34.913
and no one's gonna save you...

14:34.972 --> 14:35.972
Now it really is

14:35.973 --> 14:36.644
American history.

14:36.707 --> 14:39.278
Michael Jackson's iconic video

14:39.343 --> 14:41.448
thriller was named today to the.

14:41.512 --> 14:43.185
National Film Registry at the.

14:43.247 --> 14:44.419
Library of Congress,

14:44.481 --> 14:46.483
the first music video ever

14:46.550 --> 14:48.552
to receive that honor.

14:48.619 --> 14:50.030
Thriller,

14:50.087 --> 14:51.623
thriller...

14:51.688 --> 14:52.689
The nice thing about the list

14:52.756 --> 14:54.099
is it's all over the place.

14:54.158 --> 14:55.398
It's democratic.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.099
You're tearing me apart!

14:58.162 --> 14:59.402
I vote for films that I think

14:59.496 --> 15:00.770
are culturally significant, and

15:00.798 --> 15:02.573
sometimes I vote for films that

15:02.633 --> 15:05.944
I think... even films that I

15:06.003 --> 15:08.313
don't particularly like, I will

15:08.372 --> 15:09.646
vote for it because I think

15:09.706 --> 15:11.344
they have a special place

15:11.408 --> 15:12.546
in film history.

15:12.609 --> 15:13.917
I certainly felt,

15:13.977 --> 15:16.014
as a cultural historian myself,

15:16.080 --> 15:19.152
that this was an important part

15:19.216 --> 15:20.854
of American culture and that it

15:20.918 --> 15:22.693
had to be preserved not simply

15:22.753 --> 15:24.289
so that our grandkids could

15:24.354 --> 15:25.594
enjoy the same films that

15:25.656 --> 15:27.135
we did, but also so that

15:27.191 --> 15:28.465
they could understand

15:28.525 --> 15:29.936
what America was like

15:29.993 --> 15:31.734
at an earlier stage.

15:34.408 --> 15:35.408
Dr. Billington, the.

15:35.432 --> 15:36.638
Librarian, said something very

15:36.700 --> 15:38.145
profound a little while ago.

15:38.202 --> 15:39.943
He said that stories

15:40.003 --> 15:41.004
unite people.

15:41.071 --> 15:42.641
Theories divide them.

15:42.706 --> 15:44.151
So that in itself is a wonderful

15:44.208 --> 15:46.347
reason to preserve stories.

15:48.278 --> 15:49.621
Stories are profoundly important

15:49.680 --> 15:52.559
to human beings.

15:52.616 --> 15:55.392
500 years from now, people

15:55.452 --> 15:58.433
will look back and they'll say,

15:58.489 --> 16:00.059
"This was the beginning."

16:00.157 --> 16:01.761
This was the first 100 years.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.999
These were the origins.

16:04.061 --> 16:05.870
Why didn't they take better

16:05.929 --> 16:06.805
"care of them?"

16:06.864 --> 16:07.467
And the "they" they're

16:07.531 --> 16:10.512
talking about is us.

16:10.567 --> 16:11.841
Film is the art form

16:11.902 --> 16:14.041
of the 20th century, and we

16:14.104 --> 16:15.583
have let it go.

16:15.639 --> 16:18.017
The studios stored the films

16:18.075 --> 16:19.952
badly and they deteriorated,

16:20.010 --> 16:20.613
they burned.

16:20.677 --> 16:21.849
They didn't think of them

16:21.912 --> 16:23.186
as an art form.

16:23.247 --> 16:25.853
Half of the movies

16:25.916 --> 16:28.897
made before 1950 no longer exist

16:28.952 --> 16:30.522
in any form whatsoever.

16:30.587 --> 16:33.227
Maybe 80% or so of the

16:33.290 --> 16:35.736
silent era is gone.

16:35.792 --> 16:36.998
So much of film

16:37.060 --> 16:38.698
history has already been lost,

16:38.762 --> 16:39.797
but there's still a very great

16:39.863 --> 16:41.240
deal which can be saved if we're

16:41.298 --> 16:42.675
willing to do it.

17:09.292 --> 17:11.136
It's really amazing to pick

17:11.194 --> 17:13.141
up a roll of film and just to

17:13.196 --> 17:15.199
see this and realize the age of

17:15.265 --> 17:17.244
this film and all the people who

17:17.300 --> 17:19.440
went into making it and just to

17:19.502 --> 17:21.278
look at the images on it.

17:21.338 --> 17:22.214
All these people who worked

17:22.271 --> 17:23.579
on these things who are all

17:23.640 --> 17:24.680
gone now, but they've left

17:24.708 --> 17:26.278
behind these amazing shadows

17:26.343 --> 17:28.755
for us to enjoy.

17:33.984 --> 17:36.692
I always keep a little memento

17:36.753 --> 17:39.563
of my beginning here at my desk.

17:39.623 --> 17:44.231
This is a Castle Films headline

17:44.294 --> 17:46.399
edition, California bound.

17:46.463 --> 17:47.464
It's actually a three-minute

17:47.531 --> 17:49.238
clip from the W.C. Fields film,

17:49.299 --> 17:51.040
it's a gift, where they go to

17:51.101 --> 17:52.341
this rich man's estate and the

17:52.402 --> 17:53.682
family basically has a picnic on

17:53.704 --> 17:54.682
the lawn and makes a mess.

17:54.738 --> 17:55.443
Look out where

17:55.505 --> 17:57.143
you're going!

17:57.207 --> 17:59.084
Oh! Look what you've done!

17:59.142 --> 18:00.142
She ran right in front

18:00.210 --> 18:01.280
of the car!

18:01.311 --> 18:03.382
When I first saw W.C. Fields

18:03.447 --> 18:06.394
in this film, his humor, his

18:06.450 --> 18:08.987
sort of laconic behavior

18:09.052 --> 18:11.589
and kind of slovenliness,

18:11.655 --> 18:12.793
it spoke to me as a man

18:12.856 --> 18:14.529
and as a human being.

18:15.592 --> 18:16.592
Stop it!

18:16.593 --> 18:18.038
Oh, you idiot.

18:18.095 --> 18:19.904
Those were my mother's feathers.

18:20.831 --> 18:22.708
Stop it.

18:22.766 --> 18:23.506
Never knew your mother

18:23.567 --> 18:24.807
had feathers.

18:24.868 --> 18:26.040
Probably the most amazing and

18:26.103 --> 18:27.878
unique thing about the Packard

18:27.938 --> 18:30.043
campus is that it is part of the.

18:30.107 --> 18:31.279
Library of Congress.

18:31.341 --> 18:34.083
We are fortunate in that we get

18:34.144 --> 18:37.421
a part of a budget from Congress

18:37.481 --> 18:39.085
every year and part of that

18:39.149 --> 18:40.184
budget, and a fairly good-sized

18:40.250 --> 18:42.526
chunk, goes to preservation.

18:42.586 --> 18:43.929
In the late 1890s,

18:43.987 --> 18:46.228
the nitrocellulose film

18:46.290 --> 18:47.860
was developed.

18:47.924 --> 18:49.926
The... sort of uniqueness

18:49.993 --> 18:52.599
of the nitrate film is why they

18:52.663 --> 18:54.802
actually have a manager for just

18:54.865 --> 18:56.469
the nitrate film collection.

18:56.533 --> 18:57.739
So much of the nitrate film

18:57.801 --> 18:59.803
collection is unknown, so we are

18:59.903 --> 19:00.938
constantly working on the

19:00.971 --> 19:02.644
collection to try and identify

19:02.706 --> 19:04.481
those little bits of film that

19:04.541 --> 19:05.349
might be something really

19:05.409 --> 19:06.410
important, but we have no idea

19:06.476 --> 19:07.546
what they are.

19:07.611 --> 19:08.954
The major problem with nitrate

19:09.012 --> 19:10.889
is that it is very flammable.

19:10.947 --> 19:12.085
And when I say "very flammable",

19:12.149 --> 19:13.924
I mean it is very flammable.

19:13.984 --> 19:15.554
It is like setting a fuse on a

19:15.619 --> 19:16.619
piece of dynamite.

19:20.324 --> 19:22.065
We continued using nitrate up

19:22.125 --> 19:23.900
until the 1950s, when the

19:23.960 --> 19:25.303
triacetate safety came out

19:25.362 --> 19:26.773
and was deemed just or almost

19:26.830 --> 19:28.400
as good as the nitrate film

19:28.465 --> 19:29.465
that preceded it.

19:31.812 --> 19:32.812
Well, this is my little

19:32.836 --> 19:33.439
world here.

19:33.503 --> 19:34.914
We call this "nitrate land."

19:34.971 --> 19:36.541
These are the nitrate vaults of

19:36.606 --> 19:37.983
the Library of Congress.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.021
We have 124 climate-controlled

19:40.077 --> 19:40.714
vaults.

19:40.777 --> 19:41.448
They're maintained at about

19:41.511 --> 19:43.548
39 degrees fahrenheit, about

19:43.613 --> 19:45.251
30% relative humidity.

19:45.315 --> 19:47.124
Within these vaults, we have

19:47.184 --> 19:49.494
130,000, approximately, rolls of

19:49.553 --> 19:50.725
nitrate motion picture film

19:50.787 --> 19:53.063
dating from about 1894

19:53.123 --> 19:54.693
to about 1952.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.567
It is a truly amazing collection

19:56.626 --> 19:58.105
and one of a kind.

19:58.161 --> 20:00.937
See what else we got here.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.578
Nah...

20:05.635 --> 20:07.012
P-eww!

20:07.070 --> 20:09.141
This is our triage area of

20:09.206 --> 20:11.413
films that the other staff find

20:11.475 --> 20:13.921
that are questionable, and

20:13.977 --> 20:15.183
they're brought to me to do

20:15.245 --> 20:16.053
inspection on.

20:16.113 --> 20:17.558
This is a can of

20:17.614 --> 20:18.888
small fragments.

20:18.949 --> 20:21.429
Normally, with a film you should

20:21.485 --> 20:23.362
be able to, like, it should

20:23.420 --> 20:25.058
give somewhat and be somewhat

20:25.122 --> 20:26.294
loosely wound.

20:26.356 --> 20:28.495
This one is solid as a rock.

20:28.558 --> 20:29.935
This is what we refer to

20:29.993 --> 20:32.405
as a hockey puck.

20:32.462 --> 20:34.703
It has been wet.

20:34.765 --> 20:36.403
It is probably very stuck

20:36.466 --> 20:39.504
together, so I'm going to see if

20:39.569 --> 20:40.775
I can at least peel something

20:40.837 --> 20:48.187
off to tell what it was... ah!

20:48.245 --> 20:51.055
Oh... darn.

20:51.114 --> 20:53.526
Look at that... wow.

20:53.583 --> 20:54.789
Through a variety of reasons,

20:54.851 --> 20:58.958
through basic neglect or

20:59.022 --> 21:00.365
deterioration especially,

21:00.457 --> 21:02.494
many of our early films, and

21:02.526 --> 21:03.300
actually some more recent ones,

21:03.360 --> 21:04.168
are lost forever.

21:04.227 --> 21:05.729
I mean, there's nothing left.

21:07.097 --> 21:08.132
I know of one Academy Award-

21:08.198 --> 21:10.200
winning film called The Patriot

21:10.267 --> 21:11.575
and all that survives on it are

21:11.635 --> 21:14.047
a few trailers and stills.

21:15.572 --> 21:17.051
The other reason a lot of them

21:17.107 --> 21:18.415
don't survive, of course, is

21:18.475 --> 21:19.954
just because the studios didn't

21:20.010 --> 21:21.318
really care about 'em.

21:21.378 --> 21:22.823
They were just product, and once

21:22.879 --> 21:23.880
they were done and made their

21:23.947 --> 21:25.483
money, they went on the shelf.

21:25.549 --> 21:26.653
One studio destroyed all their

21:26.716 --> 21:27.694
silent negatives in the '40s

21:27.751 --> 21:28.751
because they didn't think

21:28.785 --> 21:29.593
anyone was ever going to

21:29.653 --> 21:30.825
want to see them again.

21:38.995 --> 21:40.030
I got involved in film

21:40.096 --> 21:41.200
archiving 'cause I saw Gone with

21:41.264 --> 21:43.403
the Wind when I was 12.

21:43.467 --> 21:44.844
And to think that I might have a

21:44.901 --> 21:46.812
part in somebody, some other

21:46.870 --> 21:48.372
12-year-old girl seeing a

21:48.438 --> 21:51.419
movie that changes their life is

21:51.475 --> 21:53.011
really exciting to me.

21:56.213 --> 21:57.715
I volunteered at the library

21:57.781 --> 22:00.785
for a month before I applied

22:00.884 --> 22:03.160
for a job and while I was

22:03.186 --> 22:04.665
volunteering, Warner Brothers

22:04.721 --> 22:05.961
was doing a restoration of Gone

22:05.989 --> 22:07.491
with the Wind, and sure enough,

22:07.557 --> 22:09.366
I walked into one of the back

22:09.426 --> 22:10.803
rooms one day to find a stack of

22:10.861 --> 22:11.965
negatives and I got really

22:12.028 --> 22:13.063
excited and I remember running

22:13.129 --> 22:14.437
into a couple people's offices,

22:14.498 --> 22:15.499
I mean, like, "Look at this!"

22:15.565 --> 22:16.908
"Look at this!" And they knew

22:16.967 --> 22:18.173
exactly why I was excited 'cause

22:18.235 --> 22:19.179
they'd found their favorite

22:19.236 --> 22:21.512
movies and had the same feeling.

22:21.571 --> 22:23.744
My favorite part of the job is

22:23.807 --> 22:25.445
spending a whole day saving a

22:25.509 --> 22:27.079
film, you know, a film that

22:27.143 --> 22:29.054
comes in that's torn and no one

22:29.112 --> 22:31.058
can watch and it's up to me to

22:31.114 --> 22:33.151
make sure that it gets to a

22:33.216 --> 22:35.822
point where it can be rescued.

22:35.886 --> 22:37.422
It's kind of like a lost

22:37.487 --> 22:38.795
puppy... That needs

22:38.855 --> 22:41.267
to be taken care of.

22:41.324 --> 22:42.997
Ah, nice.

22:43.059 --> 22:45.164
Nice splice job... oh...

22:45.228 --> 22:46.764
Is it a piece of...?

22:46.830 --> 22:48.104
Oh, that's great.

22:48.164 --> 22:49.302
So we have a piece of scotch

22:49.366 --> 22:51.039
tape that someone just stuck on

22:51.101 --> 22:52.842
the film to repair a rip.

22:52.903 --> 22:53.904
That's my job and to know

22:53.970 --> 22:55.745
that because of me spending

22:55.805 --> 22:58.479
hours staring at tiny frames and

22:58.542 --> 22:59.577
working with, you know, small

22:59.676 --> 23:01.917
pieces of tape, that future

23:01.945 --> 23:03.219
generations are gonna see it,

23:03.280 --> 23:04.350
is very exciting.

23:04.414 --> 23:05.449
A friend of mine had a

23:05.515 --> 23:06.926
16-millimeter print.

23:06.983 --> 23:08.428
He said, "you have to"

23:08.485 --> 23:09.327
see this film.

23:09.386 --> 23:10.507
I want you to see this film.

23:10.554 --> 23:12.090
"It's, like, this amazing film."

23:12.155 --> 23:13.930
There were no DVDs in those

23:13.990 --> 23:15.936
days, no videotapes, nothing.

23:15.992 --> 23:17.164
I had a Bell & Howell

23:17.227 --> 23:18.934
projector, I put the film on,

23:18.995 --> 23:19.995
I watched it and I went.

23:20.030 --> 23:22.067
"Oh, my God!"

23:22.132 --> 23:23.132
Yay!

23:23.133 --> 23:25.113
Hello, Bedford Falls!

23:27.737 --> 23:29.478
Merry Christmas!

23:29.539 --> 23:30.176
Merry Christmas!

23:30.240 --> 23:31.446
Merry Christmas, George!

23:31.508 --> 23:32.350
Merry Christmas,

23:32.409 --> 23:33.251
George!

23:33.310 --> 23:34.414
What struck me more than

23:34.477 --> 23:35.717
anything was the emotion of it.

23:35.779 --> 23:37.486
I cried.

23:37.547 --> 23:38.548
Is this the ear

23:38.615 --> 23:40.390
you can't hear on?

23:40.450 --> 23:41.929
George Bailey, I'll

23:41.985 --> 23:44.158
love you till the day I die.

23:44.220 --> 23:45.324
I'm going out exploring

23:45.388 --> 23:47.061
someday... you watch.

23:47.123 --> 23:49.069
I cried when Jimmy Stewart

23:49.125 --> 23:50.433
grabbed her and they were

23:50.493 --> 23:51.369
listening to the phone together

23:51.428 --> 23:52.702
and he grabbed her and it was

23:52.762 --> 23:53.762
one take.

23:53.797 --> 23:55.299
No cutaways, one take,

23:55.365 --> 23:56.241
and said...

23:56.299 --> 23:57.642
Now, you listen to me.

23:57.701 --> 23:59.237
I don't want any plastics and I

23:59.336 --> 24:00.713
don't want any ground floors and

24:00.737 --> 24:02.182
I don't want to get married ever

24:02.238 --> 24:03.808
to anyone... you understand that?

24:04.808 --> 24:06.310
I wanna do what I wanna do,

24:06.376 --> 24:08.754
and you're... and you're...

24:10.113 --> 24:11.558
Oh, Mary... Mary...

24:11.615 --> 24:13.219
George, George, George...

24:13.283 --> 24:15.285
It is my favorite film

24:15.352 --> 24:17.332
because it's a film that

24:17.387 --> 24:20.891
celebrates the value of life,

24:20.957 --> 24:22.994
and there is nothing greater

24:23.059 --> 24:24.402
than us all appreciating

24:24.461 --> 24:25.496
the value of our lives

24:25.562 --> 24:26.472
and other lives.

24:26.529 --> 24:28.907
Auld Lang Syne.

24:28.965 --> 24:31.809
We'll drink a cup

24:31.868 --> 24:34.644
of kindness yet

24:34.704 --> 24:40.347
for Auld Lang Syne.

24:44.648 --> 24:47.925
Film should be an experience.

24:47.984 --> 24:49.588
Reality outside the frame is

24:49.653 --> 24:52.259
your everyday life.

24:52.322 --> 24:53.960
The reality inside the frame

24:54.024 --> 24:55.435
is whatever you want to create

24:55.492 --> 24:58.029
it to be.

25:06.503 --> 25:07.641
Some films definitely give

25:07.704 --> 25:10.014
you access to a dream world.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.245
I think musicals probably do

25:11.307 --> 25:13.048
that better than most.

25:13.109 --> 25:14.747
Follow the yellow brick road.

25:14.811 --> 25:16.449
Follow the yellow brick road.

25:16.513 --> 25:17.253
Follow the

25:17.313 --> 25:18.519
yellow brick road,

25:18.581 --> 25:20.219
follow the yellow brick road

25:20.283 --> 25:21.091
follow, follow...

25:21.151 --> 25:21.993
It immediately

25:22.052 --> 25:24.123
takes you out of reality.

25:24.187 --> 25:25.996
It's something that could only

25:26.056 --> 25:28.297
happen in your dreams, but that

25:28.358 --> 25:30.360
doesn't make it less worthwhile.

25:30.427 --> 25:31.462
In fact, for me it frequently

25:31.528 --> 25:33.030
makes it more worthwhile.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.218
It's not a place you can get

25:35.265 --> 25:39.111
to by a boat or a train.

25:39.169 --> 25:42.048
It's far, far away.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.550
I would watch Wizard of Oz

25:43.606 --> 25:45.483
every day when I was two.

25:45.542 --> 25:46.987
I had a really hard time

25:47.043 --> 25:49.182
understanding that I couldn't

25:49.245 --> 25:51.384
go into the film, 'cause it felt

25:51.448 --> 25:52.950
so real to me.

25:53.016 --> 25:55.826
Somewhere

25:55.885 --> 25:58.058
over the rainbow...

25:58.121 --> 25:58.929
It's a wonderful

25:58.988 --> 25:59.864
universal story.

25:59.900 --> 26:00.900
I mean, if you look at

26:00.924 --> 26:02.130
the Wizard of Oz, it takes a

26:02.192 --> 26:03.603
reality which is the beginning

26:03.660 --> 26:05.162
of the movie and it turns it

26:05.228 --> 26:06.673
into a mythology.

26:06.730 --> 26:09.006
Dreams that you dare

26:09.065 --> 26:13.343
to dream really do come true.

26:13.403 --> 26:14.279
You know, all great

26:14.337 --> 26:16.180
storytelling is a form of myth.

26:16.239 --> 26:17.513
Tap your heels together

26:17.574 --> 26:20.783
three times...

26:20.844 --> 26:23.222
And think to yourself,

26:23.279 --> 26:26.089
"“There's no place like home."

26:26.149 --> 26:27.219
The Wizard of Oz is still

26:27.283 --> 26:28.443
my all-time favorite movie...

26:28.451 --> 26:29.361
probably for the wrong reasons.

26:29.419 --> 26:30.489
I never got why Dorothy

26:30.553 --> 26:31.861
wanted to go home.

26:31.921 --> 26:33.081
Why would she want to go home

26:33.123 --> 26:34.363
when she could live with winged

26:34.390 --> 26:35.960
monkeys and witches and...

26:36.025 --> 26:37.197
I don't know, I never understood

26:37.260 --> 26:38.739
it... I was sobbing when she went

26:38.795 --> 26:40.672
home to that dreary farm.

26:40.730 --> 26:41.572
This was a real,

26:41.631 --> 26:43.235
truly live place.

26:43.299 --> 26:45.176
And I remember that some of it

26:45.235 --> 26:47.374
wasn't very nice, but most of it

26:47.437 --> 26:48.848
was beautiful.

26:48.905 --> 26:50.384
I've always been an

26:50.440 --> 26:52.545
aficionado of science fiction,

26:52.609 --> 26:54.316
fantasy and horror.

26:54.377 --> 26:55.515
The truth is, speculative

26:55.578 --> 26:57.785
fiction has always informed us

26:57.847 --> 27:00.020
about who we are.

27:00.116 --> 27:02.153
If you go back to Invasion of

27:02.185 --> 27:03.789
the Body Snatchers, it was

27:03.853 --> 27:06.629
a parable about McCarthyism

27:06.689 --> 27:07.793
and the Red Scare.

27:09.159 --> 27:10.159
They have to be

27:10.160 --> 27:11.639
destroyed... all of them!

27:11.694 --> 27:12.694
They will be,

27:12.729 --> 27:13.571
every one of them.

27:13.630 --> 27:14.631
Listen, we're gonna have to

27:14.697 --> 27:15.471
search every building,

27:15.532 --> 27:16.636
every house in town.

27:16.699 --> 27:17.507
Men, women and children are

27:17.567 --> 27:18.409
gonna have to be examined.

27:18.468 --> 27:19.640
We've got some phoning to do.

27:19.702 --> 27:20.737
Filmmakers were able to

27:20.804 --> 27:22.841
make that film and send a

27:22.906 --> 27:24.351
message without having it be

27:24.407 --> 27:25.579
a message movie.

27:25.642 --> 27:26.643
It's a malignant disease

27:26.709 --> 27:27.346
spreading through the

27:27.410 --> 27:28.514
whole country.

27:28.578 --> 27:29.955
Initially those films

27:30.013 --> 27:31.959
were relegated to B-movies

27:32.015 --> 27:33.153
or even Z-movies.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.627
They weren't given any kind

27:34.684 --> 27:36.095
of critical acclaim.

27:36.152 --> 27:37.392
They generally weren't big

27:37.453 --> 27:39.160
commercial successes.

27:40.834 --> 27:41.834
Are you crazy?!

27:41.858 --> 27:42.858
Ya big idiot!

27:42.892 --> 27:45.133
They're here already!

27:45.195 --> 27:46.538
You're next!

27:46.596 --> 27:48.473
I think I'm not so much

27:48.531 --> 27:50.977
a fan of science fiction per se

27:51.034 --> 27:53.412
as I am a fan of cinema

27:53.469 --> 27:54.743
that creates worlds, that

27:54.804 --> 27:57.216
creates an entire alternate

27:57.273 --> 27:58.394
universe that you can escape

27:58.408 --> 28:01.082
into for a couple of hours.

28:11.287 --> 28:12.288
The first time that I.

28:12.355 --> 28:14.733
A Space Odyssey,

28:14.791 --> 28:17.829
I was completely blown away.

28:34.477 --> 28:37.321
It made me think about mankind,

28:37.380 --> 28:39.792
the future of mankind...

28:39.849 --> 28:41.123
Where we came

28:41.184 --> 28:42.424
from, where are we going?

28:42.485 --> 28:43.725
And the special effects were

28:43.786 --> 28:44.821
absolutely magnificent, and it

28:44.888 --> 28:47.027
was a film to take seriously,

28:47.090 --> 28:50.537
not a film that was disposable.

28:50.593 --> 28:53.972
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

28:54.030 --> 28:55.668
I'm sorry, Dave.

28:55.732 --> 28:58.440
I'm afraid I can't do that.

28:58.501 --> 28:59.377
You could truly lose yourself

28:59.469 --> 29:01.380
in that cinematic experience,

29:01.404 --> 29:02.712
really opening up a way

29:02.772 --> 29:04.774
of looking at reality

29:04.841 --> 29:06.514
completely differently.

29:08.478 --> 29:09.616
I've always enjoyed films

29:09.679 --> 29:11.420
that reward multiple viewings,

29:11.481 --> 29:14.155
films that if you chose to come

29:14.217 --> 29:15.355
back and look at them again,

29:15.418 --> 29:16.726
you might see something else

29:16.786 --> 29:17.786
in them.

29:23.559 --> 29:25.163
It does transport you

29:25.228 --> 29:26.832
to an entirely different

29:26.896 --> 29:29.137
time and space, and to me,

29:29.198 --> 29:30.404
it does it so well that I

29:30.466 --> 29:31.877
lose myself entirely.

29:31.935 --> 29:33.095
I'm in a dream world when I'm

29:33.102 --> 29:34.274
watching Blade Runner.

29:35.872 --> 29:37.078
Each frame, each shot

29:37.140 --> 29:38.414
is full of the most

29:38.474 --> 29:39.043
extraordinary detail.

29:39.108 --> 29:41.145
It's really too much to take in

29:41.210 --> 29:43.053
on a first viewing, and it

29:43.112 --> 29:45.058
requires subsequent viewings to

29:45.114 --> 29:46.525
sort of orient yourself in the

29:46.582 --> 29:48.528
world of that film and see all

29:48.584 --> 29:49.585
of the different layers that

29:49.652 --> 29:50.960
went into the fulfillment of

29:51.020 --> 29:52.761
that grand design.

30:00.196 --> 30:02.301
I think for my generation,

30:02.365 --> 30:03.776
there isn't a filmmaker...

30:03.833 --> 30:05.176
working in Hollywood,

30:05.234 --> 30:07.646
certainly... who can deny

30:07.704 --> 30:08.546
the influence of the.

30:08.604 --> 30:09.604
Star Wars films.

30:09.605 --> 30:10.879
The first experience that I

30:10.940 --> 30:12.351
had with Star Wars was the

30:12.408 --> 30:13.682
summer that it came out.

30:13.743 --> 30:15.222
We went to the Coronet theater

30:15.278 --> 30:16.478
in San Francisco and there was

30:16.479 --> 30:17.958
a line... the biggest line I'd

30:18.014 --> 30:19.014
ever seen as a kid...

30:19.048 --> 30:20.391
around the block.

30:20.450 --> 30:21.724
The lights go down and I

30:21.784 --> 30:22.660
didn't really know what to

30:22.719 --> 30:24.096
expect whatsoever.

30:26.422 --> 30:28.925
Huge musical hit and the Star.

30:28.992 --> 30:30.938
Wars logo goes back and then

30:30.994 --> 30:32.496
the scrolling of the text

30:32.562 --> 30:35.509
happens and... and I began to

30:35.565 --> 30:36.805
sort of just become mesmerized.

30:41.904 --> 30:44.111
And then the moment that Star.

30:44.173 --> 30:45.516
Destroyer comes overhead,

30:45.575 --> 30:46.815
that just seemed like

30:46.876 --> 30:48.116
a forever moment.

30:48.177 --> 30:49.349
I just kept watching and

30:49.412 --> 30:50.516
watching and watching, thinking,

30:50.580 --> 30:52.150
“this is the biggest spaceship.

30:52.215 --> 30:54.991
"I've ever seen."

30:55.051 --> 30:57.725
To top it all off, by the time.

30:57.787 --> 30:59.095
Darth Vader makes his

30:59.155 --> 31:00.315
appearance, people started to

31:00.323 --> 31:01.927
boo and started to hiss at Darth.

31:01.958 --> 31:03.562
Vader, and I just thought, "This"

31:03.626 --> 31:05.503
is... what is going on here?"

31:05.561 --> 31:06.733
There's something more

31:06.796 --> 31:07.956
that this movie in particular

31:07.997 --> 31:09.806
has to offer.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.141
It simply opened up

31:13.202 --> 31:14.203
a feeling of reality

31:14.270 --> 31:15.476
in science fiction.

31:18.908 --> 31:20.945
The feeling of a completely

31:21.010 --> 31:22.990
thought-through world that

31:23.046 --> 31:26.050
existed outside the frame.

31:26.115 --> 31:27.287
I think when you look at the

31:27.350 --> 31:28.420
history of movies, I don't

31:28.484 --> 31:31.226
believe there's been as dominant

31:31.287 --> 31:33.733
a cultural milestone in cinema

31:33.790 --> 31:35.463
as that first Star Wars film.

31:41.631 --> 31:43.872
Now, as opposed to being

31:43.933 --> 31:46.072
on the outside watching,

31:46.135 --> 31:47.614
now I sort of feel like I'm

31:47.670 --> 31:49.115
part of that now.

31:49.172 --> 31:51.277
Remember,

31:51.340 --> 31:53.047
the Force will be with you...

31:53.109 --> 31:54.144
Always.

31:55.711 --> 31:56.711
The world that he

31:56.746 --> 31:57.867
created is something you had

31:57.914 --> 31:59.393
never seen before and you just

31:59.482 --> 32:00.517
wanted to be with those

32:00.550 --> 32:01.824
characters in that world.

32:01.884 --> 32:03.830
I was so blown away, but I

32:03.886 --> 32:05.695
always felt like, I wanna do

32:05.755 --> 32:07.200
that in animation.

32:07.256 --> 32:08.291
Halt, who goes there?

32:08.357 --> 32:09.734
Don't shoot! It's O.K.

32:09.792 --> 32:10.792
Friends.

32:10.827 --> 32:12.101
Do you know these life forms?

32:12.161 --> 32:12.798
Yes!

32:12.862 --> 32:14.500
They're Andy's toys.

32:14.564 --> 32:15.474
All right, everyone.

32:15.531 --> 32:16.566
You're clear to come up.

32:16.632 --> 32:18.168
I am Buzz Lightyear.

32:18.234 --> 32:19.770
I come in peace.

32:19.836 --> 32:21.645
Oh, I'm so glad you're not

32:21.704 --> 32:23.240
a dinosaur!

32:23.306 --> 32:24.512
It's all I ever wanted

32:24.574 --> 32:25.574
to do, you know?

32:25.575 --> 32:27.350
My true love was cartoons, even

32:27.410 --> 32:28.912
when it was uncool, right?

32:28.978 --> 32:29.979
When you're supposed to be into

32:30.046 --> 32:33.050
girls or cars or sports or

32:33.116 --> 32:34.322
things like that, I would run

32:34.383 --> 32:35.487
home after school to watch.

32:35.551 --> 32:37.758
Bugs Bunny cartoons and always

32:37.820 --> 32:38.821
pray that it would be a

32:38.888 --> 32:40.526
Chuck Jones cartoon.

32:40.590 --> 32:43.400
Kill the wabbit?

32:43.459 --> 32:44.699
The films that have been the

32:44.760 --> 32:46.569
most influential on my career

32:46.629 --> 32:48.802
are the films of Walt Disney...

32:50.166 --> 32:52.646
Snow White...

32:52.702 --> 32:53.908
Pinocchio...

32:53.970 --> 32:55.881
I can walk!

32:58.641 --> 33:01.520
Fantasia...

33:01.555 --> 33:02.555
["Waltz of the Flowers"

33:04.580 --> 33:05.684
I think that Fantasia

33:05.748 --> 33:08.228
does represent sort of

33:08.284 --> 33:10.059
the pinnacle of animation

33:10.119 --> 33:11.393
of its time.

33:11.454 --> 33:12.455
["Night on Bald Mountain"

33:18.494 --> 33:19.268
And I was actually just

33:19.328 --> 33:20.773
looking at "Night on Bald".

33:20.830 --> 33:22.275
"Mountain" the other day because

33:22.331 --> 33:23.810
there's beautiful, beautiful

33:23.866 --> 33:25.106
fire animation.

33:25.168 --> 33:28.012
Animating fire is not easy, and

33:28.070 --> 33:29.413
I don't even know how the

33:29.472 --> 33:30.610
animators did it.

33:40.850 --> 33:42.022
So, yeah, in animation, you

33:42.084 --> 33:45.759
can do anything... and then the

33:45.821 --> 33:47.164
first time you see something

33:47.223 --> 33:49.294
that you drew come to life,

33:49.358 --> 33:51.770
you are addicted because

33:51.827 --> 33:53.238
it's like magic.

33:53.296 --> 33:54.707
When you see something

33:54.764 --> 33:57.210
that you drew move, that is a

33:57.266 --> 33:58.677
mind-blowing experience.

33:58.734 --> 34:01.237
I remember when I was 12 or 13,

34:01.337 --> 34:02.975
and I saw my first super-8

34:03.005 --> 34:04.507
animation move and it was like...

34:04.574 --> 34:05.854
I wanna say it's better than sex

34:05.875 --> 34:07.115
but I'd never had sex when I

34:07.176 --> 34:08.052
was 12, right?

34:08.110 --> 34:09.384
But it was just incredible.

34:09.445 --> 34:10.583
We knew we were

34:10.646 --> 34:11.420
making the first

34:11.480 --> 34:13.357
computer-animated feature film,

34:13.416 --> 34:15.225
but the main focus was the story

34:15.284 --> 34:16.956
and the characters.

34:20.389 --> 34:21.958
Walt Disney always said for

34:22.024 --> 34:23.128
every laugh, there should be a

34:23.192 --> 34:24.967
tear, and it's something that

34:25.027 --> 34:27.371
is so important to me in my

34:27.429 --> 34:29.068
filmmaking, is that heart,

34:29.130 --> 34:30.130
'cause I believe that's

34:30.132 --> 34:32.078
something that stays with an

34:32.134 --> 34:34.239
audience much longer than the

34:34.303 --> 34:36.304
jokes have gotten old, but that

34:36.371 --> 34:37.532
heart will always stay there.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.713
You know how you feel when you

34:39.775 --> 34:41.914
first watched these movies and

34:41.978 --> 34:44.686
it brings a tear to your eye.

34:44.746 --> 34:46.192
Absolutely, animation

34:46.248 --> 34:49.059
belongs on any list of

34:49.118 --> 34:51.792
culturally significant works.

34:51.853 --> 34:55.529
Animation... is art.

34:55.591 --> 34:56.569
When one looks through the

34:56.626 --> 34:57.900
list of films that have been

34:57.960 --> 34:59.564
selected over time, what one is

34:59.662 --> 35:01.733
struck by most of all is the

35:01.764 --> 35:03.402
extraordinary diversity of the

35:03.466 --> 35:04.274
kinds of movies.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.209
It isn't just

35:05.268 --> 35:06.178
Hollywood films.

35:06.235 --> 35:08.715
It's films that document.

35:08.771 --> 35:10.341
America's life and.

35:10.406 --> 35:11.407
America's heritage.

35:13.709 --> 35:14.869
There's a wonderful film that

35:14.910 --> 35:15.911
was named to the Registry

35:15.978 --> 35:16.888
a few years ago.

35:16.946 --> 35:18.016
It's a piece of amateur

35:18.080 --> 35:20.321
filmmaking made by the wife

35:20.383 --> 35:22.158
of a doctor in a sort of

35:22.218 --> 35:25.165
agricultural town in Minnesota

35:25.221 --> 35:26.791
in the '30s, and she went

35:26.856 --> 35:28.164
around photographing what the

35:28.224 --> 35:29.669
place looked like.

35:33.629 --> 35:34.629
Well, this is wonderful.

35:34.664 --> 35:35.836
It's like watching a bunch of

35:35.898 --> 35:37.844
live Edward Hopper and Charles.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.277
Sheeler canvases come

35:39.335 --> 35:40.575
to life, you know?

35:40.636 --> 35:41.512
Who knew?

35:41.570 --> 35:43.277
So there's a film that very

35:43.339 --> 35:44.750
specifically preserves a niche

35:44.807 --> 35:46.343
in a corner of American life.

35:53.115 --> 35:55.220
There is some sense of

35:55.284 --> 35:58.197
sadness and poignancy.

35:58.254 --> 35:59.460
It's part of our history, it's

35:59.555 --> 36:01.091
part of our family history.

36:01.123 --> 36:02.602
It's the history of a people,

36:02.658 --> 36:05.002
history of our country.

36:05.061 --> 36:08.508
One of the most tragic, yet

36:08.564 --> 36:10.669
fascinating moments in our

36:10.733 --> 36:12.440
country's history was the mass

36:12.501 --> 36:15.072
internment of 120,000

36:15.137 --> 36:17.640
Japanese-Americans.

36:17.707 --> 36:20.153
Overnight, American citizens

36:20.209 --> 36:22.348
of Japanese ancestry were looked

36:22.411 --> 36:24.288
at with fear and suspicion,

36:24.347 --> 36:26.122
simply because we looked like

36:26.182 --> 36:27.182
the people who bombed.

36:27.183 --> 36:28.457
Pearl Harbor.

36:28.517 --> 36:30.758
Mass hysteria took over the

36:30.820 --> 36:33.733
country, and President Roosevelt

36:33.789 --> 36:36.269
ordered 120,000 people taken

36:36.325 --> 36:38.931
from their homes, moved within

36:38.994 --> 36:41.600
three days and put in internment

36:41.664 --> 36:43.701
camps throughout the country.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.143
I still remember that day

36:45.201 --> 36:48.148
when two American soldiers with

36:48.204 --> 36:49.808
bayonets on their rifles came

36:49.872 --> 36:52.113
stomping up to the front door of

36:52.174 --> 36:53.619
that house and ordered

36:53.676 --> 36:55.451
our family out.

36:55.511 --> 36:57.787
And I remember my mother had

36:57.847 --> 36:59.884
tears streaming down her cheek

36:59.982 --> 37:02.155
as we moved out.

37:04.286 --> 37:06.391
It became normal for me to

37:06.455 --> 37:08.526
begin the school day in a black

37:08.591 --> 37:11.128
tar paper barrack with a Pledge

37:11.193 --> 37:12.536
of Allegiance to the flag.

37:12.595 --> 37:13.938
I could see the barbed wire

37:13.996 --> 37:15.475
fence and the sentry towers

37:15.531 --> 37:17.408
right outside my schoolhouse

37:17.466 --> 37:19.343
window as I recited the words

37:19.402 --> 37:21.211
"with liberty and justice

37:21.270 --> 37:22.578
for all."

37:26.075 --> 37:27.179
I have a nine-year-old

37:27.243 --> 37:29.849
daughter and I want her to be

37:29.912 --> 37:32.620
able to experience and see what

37:32.681 --> 37:35.662
these camps looked like.

37:35.718 --> 37:36.856
I think when you talk about the

37:36.919 --> 37:38.830
history of an experience, you

37:38.888 --> 37:41.368
can't really feel it unless you

37:41.424 --> 37:44.598
can see it and visualize it.

37:44.660 --> 37:45.263
My father is

37:45.327 --> 37:48.240
Dave Masaharu Tatsuno and he

37:48.297 --> 37:51.039
was responsible for the

37:51.100 --> 37:53.740
film Topaz, which documents

37:53.803 --> 37:55.476
life in an internment camp

37:55.538 --> 37:56.642
during World War II.

37:58.340 --> 38:00.320
That's my mother holding me

38:00.409 --> 38:02.320
in the desert.

38:02.344 --> 38:03.652
It wasn't meant to be

38:03.712 --> 38:05.385
a documentary.

38:05.448 --> 38:07.325
He was just trying to do

38:07.383 --> 38:10.023
a family film for us.

38:10.085 --> 38:12.793
What has come to be

38:12.855 --> 38:16.325
known as his film was really

38:16.392 --> 38:19.930
just a portrayal of life in the

38:19.995 --> 38:22.475
camps, of the daily struggles

38:22.531 --> 38:24.477
that people experienced and

38:24.533 --> 38:27.980
it captured for all time

38:28.037 --> 38:30.813
something that America didn't

38:30.873 --> 38:32.409
want anyone to see.

38:32.475 --> 38:35.251
Home movies are so important.

38:35.311 --> 38:36.619
They show our history... of our

38:36.679 --> 38:38.283
family, of our community,

38:38.347 --> 38:40.054
of our country.

38:40.115 --> 38:41.423
That's important,

38:41.484 --> 38:42.929
that's very important.

38:47.790 --> 38:50.031
The addition of the Zapruder

38:50.092 --> 38:52.971
film, the home movie that

38:53.028 --> 38:54.336
captured the assassination of

38:54.396 --> 38:56.603
John Kennedy, demonstrates, I

38:56.665 --> 38:58.542
think, at its farthest extent

38:58.601 --> 39:01.445
that America's film heritage,

39:01.537 --> 39:03.346
its movie heritage embraces

39:03.372 --> 39:04.510
much, much more than just a

39:04.573 --> 39:06.849
Hollywood feature film.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.582
I think, "This film is real"

39:08.644 --> 39:10.214
and it happened during

39:10.279 --> 39:11.553
"my lifetime."

39:11.614 --> 39:13.719
I saw it, it's ugly, it's

39:13.782 --> 39:16.160
sudden, it's shocking and it's

39:16.218 --> 39:18.095
inexplicable, and the only way

39:18.153 --> 39:20.599
that you can recreate the

39:20.656 --> 39:22.260
experience of it is showing it.

39:36.138 --> 39:37.549
Hey you, come on

39:37.606 --> 39:39.279
out of there.

39:39.341 --> 39:43.517
Come on!

39:43.579 --> 39:46.219
Well, I'm a... too many of you

39:46.282 --> 39:47.322
dames gettin' away with it

39:47.349 --> 39:48.191
these days.

39:48.250 --> 39:49.058
The cops in the yards'll

39:49.118 --> 39:49.789
take care of you!

39:49.852 --> 39:51.058
Oh, wait a minute.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.428
You wouldn't throw us off

39:52.488 --> 39:53.523
the train, would you?

39:53.589 --> 39:54.363
Yeah, and you're gonna get

39:54.423 --> 39:55.424
30 days for it.

39:55.491 --> 39:56.367
In jail?

39:56.425 --> 39:57.529
Yes, in jail!

39:58.994 --> 40:01.668
Now why don't we sit down

40:01.730 --> 40:03.437
and talk this thing over?

40:06.669 --> 40:09.309
Almost always, the things

40:09.371 --> 40:11.112
that people wanted to cut out of

40:11.173 --> 40:14.313
movies were ideas.

40:14.376 --> 40:16.253
And so you have ideas being cut

40:16.312 --> 40:17.916
out of the original Baby Face by

40:17.980 --> 40:20.824
the New York censors.

40:20.883 --> 40:22.157
That man

40:22.217 --> 40:23.321
of mine...

40:24.263 --> 40:25.263
Baby face was really

40:25.287 --> 40:26.129
interesting 'cause I'd known the

40:26.188 --> 40:27.223
film for a long time and

40:27.289 --> 40:28.495
actually, I had a copy of it

40:28.557 --> 40:30.059
on laserdisc... for those who

40:30.125 --> 40:31.325
remember what laserdiscs were.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.273
They asked me to go and check

40:34.330 --> 40:36.003
the negative to see what

40:36.065 --> 40:37.408
condition it was in, and that's

40:37.466 --> 40:38.536
when I noticed that we actually

40:38.601 --> 40:40.274
had two negatives.

40:40.336 --> 40:41.872
So I get 'em out, and I start

40:41.937 --> 40:43.712
looking at the two reel ones and

40:43.772 --> 40:45.479
I notice that there's something

40:45.541 --> 40:46.884
strange about them, so I

40:46.942 --> 40:48.250
put the two reel ones down on a

40:48.310 --> 40:50.051
table and set one of top of the

40:50.112 --> 40:51.250
other one and that's when I

40:51.313 --> 40:53.315
noticed that, you know, like the

40:53.382 --> 40:54.861
one reel one was this big...

40:54.917 --> 40:56.089
And the other reel one was like

40:56.151 --> 40:57.789
this big, and I'm like, “There's

40:57.853 --> 40:59.526
"something going on here."

40:59.622 --> 41:01.033
Say, I like it here.

41:01.056 --> 41:02.160
How about a job?

41:02.224 --> 41:02.827
Oh, we don't...

41:02.891 --> 41:04.051
Oh, now don't tell me in this

41:04.059 --> 41:05.094
great big building there ain't

41:05.160 --> 41:08.471
some place for me.

41:08.530 --> 41:11.909
Have you had any experience?

41:11.967 --> 41:12.967
Plenty.

41:12.968 --> 41:13.605
And I started going

41:13.669 --> 41:14.409
through the two negatives

41:14.470 --> 41:15.470
and also listening to the

41:15.471 --> 41:17.144
soundtracks and began finding

41:17.206 --> 41:19.049
these differences, these

41:19.108 --> 41:19.916
great differences between

41:19.975 --> 41:21.249
the two films.

41:21.310 --> 41:22.983
And then he has the Eureka

41:23.045 --> 41:24.854
moment and he realizes that what

41:24.913 --> 41:26.950
he has is the film before

41:27.016 --> 41:29.257
it was edited!

41:29.318 --> 41:30.388
That the five minutes with

41:30.452 --> 41:31.692
Barbara Stanwyck going to the

41:31.754 --> 41:33.631
city to use what she has,

41:33.689 --> 41:35.691
you know, to get what she

41:35.758 --> 41:37.999
wants is in there, and they

41:38.060 --> 41:41.735
thought it was lost.

41:41.797 --> 41:42.798
The boss won't be back

41:42.865 --> 41:44.538
for an hour.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.011
Well then, why don't we go in

41:46.068 --> 41:50.039
and talk this over?

42:11.971 --> 42:12.971
The original

42:12.995 --> 42:13.837
negative was cut to the

42:13.896 --> 42:15.102
censorship version.

42:15.164 --> 42:16.905
The duplicate negative was the

42:16.965 --> 42:18.876
original pre-censored version

42:18.934 --> 42:20.641
that had all the naughty bits

42:20.703 --> 42:22.842
still in it, and that was

42:22.905 --> 42:24.026
just... I mean that was just

42:24.073 --> 42:25.347
the find of a lifetime.

42:25.407 --> 42:27.478
Look, here.

42:27.543 --> 42:29.523
Nietzsche says "All life",

42:29.578 --> 42:31.888
no matter how we idealize it,

42:31.947 --> 42:33.426
is nothing more nor less

42:33.482 --> 42:36.088
"than exploitation."

42:36.151 --> 42:38.153
That's what I'm telling you.

42:38.220 --> 42:40.131
Exploit yourself!

42:40.189 --> 42:41.827
Go to some big city where you

42:41.890 --> 42:43.597
will find opportunities.

42:43.659 --> 42:44.933
Use men!

42:44.993 --> 42:47.735
Be strong! Defiant!

42:47.796 --> 42:50.743
Use men to get the things

42:50.799 --> 42:52.437
you want!

42:52.501 --> 42:54.481
The version that was

42:54.536 --> 42:56.379
discovered puts some of the

42:56.438 --> 42:58.418
sex back, but it puts a lot

42:58.474 --> 43:00.351
of the philosophy back.

43:00.442 --> 43:01.944
Yeah.

43:01.977 --> 43:03.081
The New York censors

43:03.145 --> 43:04.522
altered the sharpness of the

43:04.580 --> 43:06.184
philosophical thrust for the

43:06.248 --> 43:07.454
release version because they

43:07.516 --> 43:08.516
were afraid that it would

43:08.517 --> 43:09.723
offend people.

43:09.785 --> 43:11.423
What chance has a woman got?

43:11.487 --> 43:13.967
More chance than men.

43:14.022 --> 43:16.059
A woman... young, beautiful like

43:16.125 --> 43:17.035
you are... could get anything

43:17.092 --> 43:18.537
she wants in the world...

43:18.594 --> 43:19.594
But there is a right

43:19.595 --> 43:20.835
and a wrong way.

43:20.896 --> 43:22.500
Remember the price of the wrong

43:22.564 --> 43:23.804
way is too great.

43:23.866 --> 43:26.142
Go to some big city where you

43:26.201 --> 43:27.737
will find opportunities.

43:27.803 --> 43:29.441
Don't let people mislead you.

43:29.505 --> 43:30.677
You must be a master,

43:30.739 --> 43:32.377
not a slave.

43:32.441 --> 43:35.752
Be clean, be strong, defiant.

43:35.811 --> 43:42.057
And you will be a success.

43:42.117 --> 43:43.152
You always hear

43:43.218 --> 43:44.788
about these things but they

43:44.853 --> 43:46.332
never survive.

43:46.388 --> 43:47.526
Yeah.

43:47.589 --> 43:48.589
And to this day, I don't

43:48.590 --> 43:49.432
think we've found out exactly

43:49.491 --> 43:53.029
why this negative survives and

43:53.095 --> 43:54.597
why on this particular film,

43:54.663 --> 43:56.040
they actually made this

43:56.098 --> 43:57.668
duplicate negative before

43:57.733 --> 44:00.907
they cut the film.

44:01.003 --> 44:01.845
You can make a movie,

44:01.870 --> 44:03.474
by the way, that endorses

44:03.539 --> 44:04.540
conventional morality,

44:04.606 --> 44:06.051
that's not the problem.

44:06.108 --> 44:07.086
The problem is that it was

44:07.142 --> 44:08.746
not sincere, it's not real.

44:08.811 --> 44:10.518
And in the case of Baby Face,

44:10.579 --> 44:11.660
when it really said what it

44:11.713 --> 44:12.714
wanted to say, of course,

44:12.781 --> 44:14.260
it's better.

44:15.717 --> 44:17.458
That is why censorship

44:17.519 --> 44:19.192
is so horrible.

44:19.254 --> 44:22.292
Because censorship blocks the

44:22.357 --> 44:24.394
free expression of an era

44:24.459 --> 44:26.132
talking to another era.

44:27.196 --> 44:29.005
For the most part, most films

44:29.064 --> 44:30.737
that are made are entertainment

44:30.799 --> 44:32.335
and that's all they're meant to

44:32.401 --> 44:35.007
be and I think there's a, an

44:35.070 --> 44:36.777
unfortunate sense people have

44:36.839 --> 44:39.513
that all films are just films.

44:39.575 --> 44:41.555
Well, I think the shining

44:41.610 --> 44:44.591
example of something that is

44:44.646 --> 44:46.353
a folk fantasy and commercial

44:46.415 --> 44:48.622
and art is probably Godfather.

44:53.455 --> 44:54.455
I used to live in.

44:54.456 --> 44:55.867
Bayside, Queens, and there's a

44:55.924 --> 44:57.232
local theater there, R.K.O.

44:57.292 --> 44:59.465
Keith's, which was an old, kind

44:59.561 --> 45:01.563
of ornate theater that had the

45:01.597 --> 45:03.076
skylights and the stars and had

45:03.131 --> 45:04.576
the balcony and that's where I

45:04.633 --> 45:05.873
had first seen The Godfather

45:05.934 --> 45:06.934
played in that theater.

45:06.969 --> 45:08.539
And it played great, it sounded

45:08.604 --> 45:09.275
great, it looked great.

45:09.338 --> 45:12.182
Eh... now you come to me and

45:12.241 --> 45:14.278
you say, "Don Corleone",

45:14.343 --> 45:17.347
give me justice."

45:17.412 --> 45:20.484
But you don't ask with respect.

45:20.549 --> 45:23.189
You don't offer friendship.

45:23.252 --> 45:23.992
You don't even think

45:24.052 --> 45:25.190
to call me Godfather.

45:25.254 --> 45:26.254
Somehow, with the

45:26.255 --> 45:27.563
performances of all the actors,

45:27.623 --> 45:29.398
especially Brando, hit that

45:29.458 --> 45:30.835
neural cord that we all have and

45:30.893 --> 45:31.963
there was a visceral reaction

45:32.027 --> 45:33.404
from almost anyone who saw it.

45:33.462 --> 45:34.839
The cinematographer on The.

45:34.897 --> 45:36.097
Godfather, Gordon Willis... one

45:36.098 --> 45:37.941
of the great cinematographers of

45:38.000 --> 45:41.072
our time... did a very, very

45:41.136 --> 45:42.479
daring thing when he

45:42.537 --> 45:43.658
photographed those pictures.

45:43.705 --> 45:46.686
Gordon decided that he didn't

45:46.742 --> 45:48.483
want people messing about with

45:48.543 --> 45:50.352
his image and he shot it in a

45:50.412 --> 45:51.982
way that you couldn't print it

45:52.047 --> 45:54.755
in any other way than the way

45:54.816 --> 45:55.988
that he shot it.

45:56.051 --> 45:57.462
You can get the color wrong,

45:57.519 --> 45:58.554
you can make skin green

45:58.620 --> 46:00.224
if you want to, but it's

46:00.322 --> 46:03.326
gotta be printed dark.

46:06.228 --> 46:08.208
I'm glad you came, Mike.

46:08.263 --> 46:09.264
I hope we can straighten

46:09.331 --> 46:09.866
everything out.

46:09.932 --> 46:11.036
The original

46:11.099 --> 46:13.340
negatives of Godfather I and.

46:13.402 --> 46:14.904
Godfather II were not in good

46:14.970 --> 46:16.745
condition, were not capable of

46:16.805 --> 46:18.478
making new copies, and they

46:18.540 --> 46:20.520
really needed a restoration.

46:20.575 --> 46:21.610
The negative of that film

46:21.677 --> 46:22.519
was in tatters.

46:22.577 --> 46:23.817
And this is The Godfather, this

46:23.879 --> 46:25.187
is... this is The Godfather.

46:26.081 --> 46:27.185
This is a film, you know, I

46:27.249 --> 46:28.023
think people consider... if not

46:28.083 --> 46:29.824
maybe the greatest film of

46:29.885 --> 46:31.364
all time, one of them.

46:31.420 --> 46:32.524
A lot of prints were made

46:32.587 --> 46:33.827
from that original negative,

46:33.889 --> 46:35.197
more so than probably should

46:35.257 --> 46:35.860
have been made.

46:35.924 --> 46:36.834
The negative sustained some

46:36.892 --> 46:38.303
injury, as any negative that

46:38.360 --> 46:39.737
gets overused will.

46:39.795 --> 46:41.138
The more popular the film,

46:41.196 --> 46:42.300
the worse condition the original

46:42.364 --> 46:44.275
negative is going to be in.

46:44.333 --> 46:45.744
It's been loved to death.

46:45.801 --> 46:47.678
It's not until the past

46:47.736 --> 46:50.216
15, maybe as far as 20 years,

46:50.272 --> 46:51.649
that the studios have realized

46:51.707 --> 46:52.947
what they have stacked away

46:53.008 --> 46:54.180
in their vaults.

46:54.242 --> 46:55.380
They really didn't realize that

46:55.444 --> 46:56.752
these golden treasures that they

46:56.812 --> 46:58.257
had in their vaults and hence,

46:58.313 --> 46:59.553
they weren't looked after

46:59.648 --> 47:00.854
very well.

47:04.386 --> 47:05.592
The beauty of this job is that

47:05.654 --> 47:06.724
once you start working on these

47:06.788 --> 47:07.994
films and you start getting to

47:08.056 --> 47:09.626
explore them scene by scene,

47:09.691 --> 47:11.295
shot by shot, frame by frame,

47:11.360 --> 47:13.601
you get to see little things,

47:13.662 --> 47:15.699
little nuances, little pieces

47:15.764 --> 47:17.072
of the puzzle... and your

47:17.132 --> 47:18.509
appreciation for the film

47:18.567 --> 47:20.410
just explodes.

47:20.469 --> 47:21.072
We're not

47:21.136 --> 47:22.809
creating anything.

47:22.871 --> 47:24.509
What we're doing is to try

47:24.573 --> 47:25.881
and take what people made

47:25.941 --> 47:28.820
and just preserve it and make

47:28.877 --> 47:30.049
it look like what it was

47:30.112 --> 47:31.216
supposed to look like.

47:31.279 --> 47:33.623
The trick is not to change it.

47:38.787 --> 47:40.289
Don Corleone.

47:40.355 --> 47:41.026
The thing about

47:41.089 --> 47:43.592
movies, it's about storytelling.

47:43.658 --> 47:46.264
And the story that it tells

47:46.328 --> 47:47.602
still today stands up

47:47.662 --> 47:50.973
very strong.

47:52.234 --> 47:53.838
At first, you think,

47:53.902 --> 47:55.006
"Oh, God, this is gonna be the"

47:55.070 --> 47:56.242
same 20 movies.

47:56.304 --> 47:57.304
We're gonna have on here

47:57.339 --> 47:58.079
Casablanca, we're gonna

47:58.140 --> 47:59.915
"have the obvious ones, right'?"

48:00.008 --> 48:01.578
You do have them.

48:01.610 --> 48:02.384
But then you have some

48:02.444 --> 48:03.444
that are surprising.

48:03.445 --> 48:05.982
I said...

48:06.048 --> 48:08.528
"Relax and don't say anything,"

48:08.583 --> 48:10.256
I just want to talk about a film

48:10.318 --> 48:12.355
which I'm sure has never been

48:12.421 --> 48:13.461
"brought up at the board."

48:14.956 --> 48:17.061
How do you do-ah?

48:17.125 --> 48:19.435
See you've met my

48:19.494 --> 48:22.407
faithful handyman...

48:22.464 --> 48:23.272
People are gonna say,

48:23.331 --> 48:24.742
"You must be, you must be crazy."

48:24.800 --> 48:26.575
The film's lacking in taste,

48:26.635 --> 48:27.943
"it's this, it's that."

48:28.003 --> 48:29.209
But at the same time, here's a

48:29.271 --> 48:30.471
film that's played at midnight

48:30.472 --> 48:32.577
in theaters across the country

48:32.641 --> 48:33.984
for 30 years.

48:34.042 --> 48:35.385
There's a reason why The Rocky.

48:35.444 --> 48:37.890
Horror Show is a popular film.

48:37.946 --> 48:39.289
Well, if it's that popular,

48:39.347 --> 48:41.691
it must be speaking somehow

48:41.750 --> 48:42.353
to this country.

48:42.417 --> 48:44.488
There must be something woven

48:44.553 --> 48:46.999
into what makes that film work.

48:47.055 --> 48:50.161
One hell of a lover

48:50.225 --> 48:54.731
I'm just a sweet transvestite

48:54.796 --> 48:55.796
from...

48:55.797 --> 48:56.605
And I have to

48:56.665 --> 48:57.700
sympathize with Dr. Billington

48:57.766 --> 49:00.144
because he has to go to the

49:00.235 --> 49:02.875
halls of Congress and tell

49:02.904 --> 49:05.407
everyone one of the 25 films

49:05.474 --> 49:06.851
is The Rocky Horror Show.

49:06.908 --> 49:07.978
"It's this great film!"

49:08.043 --> 49:09.181
It's about transvestites

49:09.244 --> 49:10.814
and men from Mars and

49:10.879 --> 49:12.256
"dancing hunchbacks."

49:12.314 --> 49:14.658
I don't know how he does it.

49:14.716 --> 49:16.855
Well, it, it, it...

49:16.918 --> 49:18.192
Certainly widened my horizon.

49:18.253 --> 49:19.163
With your hands

49:19.221 --> 49:21.201
on your hips.

49:21.256 --> 49:22.030
Bring your knees

49:22.090 --> 49:23.569
in tight...

49:23.625 --> 49:24.626
Honestly,

49:24.693 --> 49:25.693
when you're dealing with

49:25.727 --> 49:27.035
a wide variety, you have to

49:27.095 --> 49:29.905
be open to a wide variety.

49:29.965 --> 49:30.965
Rocky Horror Picture.

49:30.966 --> 49:32.468
Show is the, the most

49:32.534 --> 49:33.911
successful midnight movie ever,

49:33.969 --> 49:34.947
way more than Pink Flamingos

49:35.003 --> 49:35.811
ever was.

49:35.871 --> 49:38.374
Let's do the time warp

49:38.440 --> 49:40.477
again.

49:44.346 --> 49:45.346
I'll tell you a story

49:45.347 --> 49:46.223
about it.

49:46.281 --> 49:48.761
A woman came up to me and she

49:48.817 --> 49:50.017
said, "I saw you sitting here",

49:50.018 --> 49:51.861
and I just had to tell you that.

49:51.920 --> 49:55.595
"Spinal Tap... saved my life."

49:55.657 --> 49:57.898
Coming live, direct from

49:57.959 --> 49:59.996
hell, Spinal Tap!

50:00.739 --> 50:01.739
You're hot,

50:01.763 --> 50:03.071
you take all we've got.

50:03.131 --> 50:04.166
Not a dry seat

50:04.232 --> 50:06.109
in the house...

50:06.168 --> 50:07.203
No, I'm not gonna tell

50:07.269 --> 50:08.145
that story.

50:08.203 --> 50:09.363
No, it was The Princess Bride

50:09.371 --> 50:10.111
that saved her life,

50:10.172 --> 50:11.378
so Spinal Tap didn't save

50:11.439 --> 50:12.782
her life at all.

50:12.841 --> 50:14.013
It was Princess Bride that

50:14.075 --> 50:15.383
saved her life... and I don't

50:15.443 --> 50:16.353
think that's on the registry,

50:16.411 --> 50:17.151
but it should be.

50:17.212 --> 50:18.212
On our way, but tonight

50:18.213 --> 50:18.987
we're gonna rock ya.

50:19.047 --> 50:20.151
Tonight I'm gonna rock ya.

50:20.215 --> 50:21.023
Yeah, tonight we're gonna

50:21.082 --> 50:21.787
rock ya...

50:21.850 --> 50:22.971
When we first showed it in a

50:23.018 --> 50:24.656
preview in Dallas, the people

50:24.719 --> 50:25.879
came up to me and said, "Why"

50:25.887 --> 50:27.127
would you make a movie about a

50:27.189 --> 50:29.430
band that nobody's heard of and

50:29.491 --> 50:31.334
a band that's so bad?

50:31.393 --> 50:32.497
Why don't you make a movie about

50:32.561 --> 50:35.804
"the Rolling Stones?"

50:38.166 --> 50:39.446
So it took a while for people to

50:39.501 --> 50:40.661
catch up to it, but once they

50:40.702 --> 50:43.512
did, it became this kind of

50:43.572 --> 50:47.247
iconic representation of the

50:47.309 --> 50:48.515
world of rock and roll.

50:48.577 --> 50:50.716
What we do is if we need that

50:50.779 --> 50:52.656
extra push over the cliff,

50:52.714 --> 50:53.624
you know what we do?

50:53.682 --> 50:54.683
Put it up to 11.

50:54.749 --> 50:55.887
11, exactly.

50:55.951 --> 50:56.759
I love This Is.

50:56.818 --> 50:57.558
Spinal Tap.

50:57.619 --> 51:00.566
It takes the things that are

51:00.655 --> 51:02.692
naturally humorous about that

51:02.724 --> 51:04.362
lifestyle and exaggerates them.

51:04.426 --> 51:05.302
One louder.

51:05.360 --> 51:06.202
Why don't you just make

51:06.261 --> 51:07.467
10 louder, and make 10 be

51:07.529 --> 51:09.338
the top... number and make that

51:09.397 --> 51:13.402
a little louder?

51:13.468 --> 51:14.742
These go to 11.

51:14.803 --> 51:16.544
Oh, Ma.

51:22.955 --> 51:23.955
Oh...

51:23.979 --> 51:25.083
I never would have heard of

51:25.146 --> 51:28.150
this... a very early sound film

51:28.216 --> 51:30.594
demonstration which is a

51:30.652 --> 51:32.325
quacking duck.

51:34.422 --> 51:35.696
Oh, Ma!

51:35.757 --> 51:36.827
One can look at Gus.

51:36.891 --> 51:37.995
Visser and you can think, "Hmm",

51:38.059 --> 51:39.180
what is the aesthetic value?

51:39.227 --> 51:40.507
"That might be hard to justify."

51:40.562 --> 51:42.235
It's there because it

51:42.297 --> 51:44.106
demonstrates an important

51:44.165 --> 51:45.166
breakthrough in the

51:45.233 --> 51:46.735
technology of the history

51:46.801 --> 51:48.144
of motion pictures.

51:48.203 --> 51:49.307
It was brought to our

51:49.371 --> 51:50.611
attention and we watched it and

51:50.672 --> 51:51.912
said, "We have to have this",

51:51.973 --> 51:53.316
it's a sound film demonstration.

51:53.375 --> 51:54.683
"And it's hysterical."

51:54.743 --> 51:56.848
It's a film you can't really

51:56.911 --> 51:57.911
describe...

51:57.946 --> 52:00.187
How he makes the duck quack.

52:02.751 --> 52:04.890
He's kissing me.

52:06.288 --> 52:07.392
I will say that when I was

52:07.455 --> 52:08.490
looking at the movies that are

52:08.556 --> 52:09.534
on the National Film Registry,

52:09.591 --> 52:11.832
I was pleasantly surprised that.

52:11.893 --> 52:13.236
Blazing Saddles was on there.

52:15.297 --> 52:16.298
Blazing Saddles was basically

52:16.364 --> 52:18.071
nominated by a reporter who has

52:18.133 --> 52:19.612
done a lot of articles on the.

52:19.668 --> 52:22.774
Registry and preservation.

52:22.837 --> 52:24.544
Blazing Saddles has a

52:24.606 --> 52:25.949
special place in my heart.

52:26.007 --> 52:27.850
I love the myth of the

52:27.909 --> 52:28.717
American West.

52:28.777 --> 52:29.937
I like cowboys, I like cowboy

52:29.978 --> 52:31.787
stories, I like cowboy poetry.

52:31.846 --> 52:33.621
I like Roy Rogers, I like dances

52:33.682 --> 52:34.285
with wolves.

52:34.349 --> 52:36.295
Two...

52:36.351 --> 52:37.351
Three!

52:41.667 --> 52:42.667
That myth of

52:42.691 --> 52:43.761
the American West is the

52:43.825 --> 52:44.929
myth of America.

52:44.993 --> 52:46.802
But Blazing Saddles takes that

52:46.861 --> 52:48.363
myth and twists it and turns it

52:48.430 --> 52:49.238
on its head.

52:49.297 --> 52:50.674
It also takes the moviemaking

52:50.732 --> 52:52.268
myth and twists it and turns it

52:52.334 --> 52:53.642
on its head.

52:53.702 --> 52:54.702
Raisinets!

52:56.237 --> 52:58.080
And finally, the Board said,

52:58.139 --> 52:59.812
"Well, he may have a point."

52:59.908 --> 53:02.047
And the rest is history.

53:06.181 --> 53:07.990
To see Blazing Saddles on

53:08.049 --> 53:09.892
there was a little bit of

53:09.951 --> 53:11.897
vindication for me, that I

53:11.953 --> 53:12.795
didn't waste my time in

53:12.854 --> 53:13.958
college watching that movie

53:14.022 --> 53:15.092
so many times.

53:16.624 --> 53:18.103
I wasn't wasting my time.

53:18.159 --> 53:20.730
I was enriching myself with film

53:20.795 --> 53:24.971
history.

53:27.035 --> 53:28.639
Why don't you let him go by?

53:28.703 --> 53:29.579
Well, he wants the

53:29.637 --> 53:30.172
whole road.

53:30.238 --> 53:31.410
Now, look, all I'm trying to say

53:31.473 --> 53:32.611
is there are lots of things that

53:32.674 --> 53:34.176
a man can do and in society's

53:34.242 --> 53:35.880
eyes it's all hunky dory.

53:35.944 --> 53:37.548
A woman does the same thing...

53:37.612 --> 53:39.023
the same, mind you... and she's

53:39.080 --> 53:39.956
an outcast.

53:40.014 --> 53:41.014
Finished?

53:41.015 --> 53:42.187
No.

53:42.250 --> 53:44.230
One of the most important

53:44.285 --> 53:46.822
things that I can do with my

53:46.888 --> 53:49.425
role on the Board is to keep the

53:49.491 --> 53:51.767
contribution of women to film

53:51.826 --> 53:54.102
history in the center of our

53:54.162 --> 53:55.266
discussions.

53:55.330 --> 53:56.172
We had to write reports

53:56.231 --> 53:58.233
on what we wanted to be and

53:58.299 --> 53:59.539
the boy next to me wrote a

53:59.634 --> 54:00.908
composition on how he was gonna

54:00.935 --> 54:02.676
be a movie director.

54:02.737 --> 54:04.683
And I got so angry at him,

54:04.739 --> 54:06.946
because movies seemed too good

54:07.008 --> 54:08.851
for us, like they came from

54:08.910 --> 54:10.548
magical people in Hollywood and

54:10.612 --> 54:11.989
here he was, the guy that

54:12.046 --> 54:13.047
cheated off of me during

54:13.114 --> 54:14.821
the tests and how could he

54:14.883 --> 54:16.760
be a movie director?

54:16.818 --> 54:17.853
And then I thought,

54:17.919 --> 54:19.421
"Well, I must be this angry"

54:19.487 --> 54:20.488
because that's what really,

54:20.555 --> 54:21.829
"what I want to do."

54:21.890 --> 54:23.801
Awesome!

54:23.858 --> 54:25.428
Totally awesome!

54:25.493 --> 54:26.301
Fast Times at Ridgemont.

54:26.361 --> 54:27.271
High is one of my

54:27.328 --> 54:27.965
favorite films.

54:28.029 --> 54:29.269
Not the favorite, you know, but

54:29.297 --> 54:30.776
when Sean Penn ordered the pizza

54:30.832 --> 54:31.832
into the classroom...

54:31.866 --> 54:32.810
Who ordered the double cheese

54:32.867 --> 54:33.777
and sausage?

54:33.835 --> 54:36.145
Right here, dude.

54:36.204 --> 54:37.080
I thought, "This is the"

54:37.138 --> 54:38.617
best moment in American film

54:38.673 --> 54:41.210
"history," actually.

54:44.746 --> 54:45.952
Very few people know

54:46.014 --> 54:48.426
about the extent of the

54:48.483 --> 54:49.518
involvement of women

54:49.584 --> 54:50.756
in early film culture

54:50.819 --> 54:51.854
in the United States.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.900
Half of all films in the silent

54:53.955 --> 54:55.229
era were written by women.

54:55.290 --> 54:56.860
All of the top screenwriters

54:56.925 --> 54:57.801
were women.

54:57.859 --> 54:59.065
The highest paid screenwriters

54:59.127 --> 55:00.231
were all women.

55:00.328 --> 55:02.103
And many of the top directors

55:02.130 --> 55:03.370
were women.

55:03.431 --> 55:05.104
It was a growing industry.

55:05.166 --> 55:06.907
It was the popular mass medium.

55:06.968 --> 55:07.946
People were going to the film

55:08.002 --> 55:09.345
every single day.

55:09.404 --> 55:10.439
So, there were incredible

55:10.505 --> 55:11.505
opportunities for women

55:11.539 --> 55:12.539
in Hollywood.

55:16.511 --> 55:18.320
Lois Weber is an extraordinary

55:18.379 --> 55:20.450
figure in American film history

55:20.515 --> 55:22.688
and she's somebody who very few

55:22.750 --> 55:23.854
people know about.

55:23.918 --> 55:25.397
Everybody's heard of D.W.

55:25.453 --> 55:26.693
Griffith, everybody's heard of

55:26.754 --> 55:28.495
Cecil B. Demille and in the

55:28.556 --> 55:32.265
1910s, Weber was often mentioned

55:32.327 --> 55:33.806
alongside Griffith and Demille

55:33.862 --> 55:35.432
as the three great minds of

55:35.497 --> 55:36.567
filmmaking.

55:36.631 --> 55:38.110
She was Universal's top

55:38.166 --> 55:39.338
director.

55:39.400 --> 55:40.879
And she was a top director who

55:40.935 --> 55:44.109
made socially engaged films

55:44.172 --> 55:45.583
about the key problems

55:45.640 --> 55:46.640
of the day.

55:49.177 --> 55:50.815
The film that's in the film

55:50.879 --> 55:52.381
registry, Where Are My.

55:52.447 --> 55:54.017
Children?, is a film about

55:54.082 --> 55:55.254
birth control and abortion

55:55.316 --> 55:56.386
and it was Universal's

55:56.451 --> 55:58.829
top moneymaker of 1916.

55:58.887 --> 55:59.627
It traveled all around

55:59.721 --> 56:01.530
the world.

56:01.556 --> 56:02.694
Not only did she make these

56:02.757 --> 56:06.330
films about really difficult...

56:06.394 --> 56:07.134
issues that we're still

56:07.195 --> 56:08.833
grappling with as a culture,

56:08.897 --> 56:10.740
she made popular, box office

56:10.798 --> 56:12.436
successes.

56:16.204 --> 56:18.411
When you start looking at the

56:18.473 --> 56:20.316
studio era, the '30s and '40s

56:20.375 --> 56:21.945
and beyond, then you really do

56:22.010 --> 56:23.284
see gender bias.

56:23.344 --> 56:24.914
Then it really becomes nearly

56:24.979 --> 56:27.391
impossible for women to direct.

56:27.448 --> 56:29.052
When I was in

56:29.117 --> 56:30.926
graduate school at U.S.C.

56:30.985 --> 56:32.896
Cinema, a group of us organized

56:32.954 --> 56:35.798
a small screening series called.

56:35.857 --> 56:37.666
Films by Great Women Directors

56:37.725 --> 56:39.534
and somebody wrote across the

56:39.594 --> 56:41.039
sign "There are none."

56:41.095 --> 56:42.199
Often when you're working

56:42.263 --> 56:43.936
with the studios, they'll give

56:43.998 --> 56:45.204
you a list of pre-approved

56:45.266 --> 56:46.244
directors and you'll find that

56:46.301 --> 56:48.508
there are very few, if, in many

56:48.570 --> 56:50.072
cases, no women directors

56:50.138 --> 56:51.138
on the list.

56:55.076 --> 56:56.646
Dorothy Arzner is

56:56.711 --> 56:59.089
the only woman to work as a

56:59.147 --> 57:00.854
director in the studio era

57:00.949 --> 57:01.984
in the '30s and '40s.

57:02.016 --> 57:03.120
That's an extraordinary

57:03.184 --> 57:04.527
accomplishment.

57:04.586 --> 57:05.586
She would also joke that

57:05.620 --> 57:06.963
she was one of the guys.

57:07.021 --> 57:08.500
She used to dress like a man,

57:08.556 --> 57:09.796
she used to hang about with the

57:09.857 --> 57:11.234
guys, she used to behave like

57:11.292 --> 57:12.293
the guys, and she always said,

57:12.360 --> 57:13.532
"that's how I got on in the"

57:13.595 --> 57:14.573
industry, 'cause I was just

57:14.629 --> 57:15.505
one of the guys.

57:15.563 --> 57:16.564
They didn't think about me as

57:16.631 --> 57:18.167
being a woman, I was just a guy

57:18.232 --> 57:20.508
"directing films."

57:20.568 --> 57:22.172
Dance, Girl, Dance is

57:22.236 --> 57:24.716
a film that takes on, in an

57:24.772 --> 57:26.683
allegorical way, Hollywood's

57:26.741 --> 57:28.152
representation of women.

57:28.209 --> 57:31.156
It's about a dancer who aspires

57:31.212 --> 57:35.058
to be a serious ballet dancer.

57:35.116 --> 57:37.062
She's sort of stuck as the comic

57:37.118 --> 57:39.928
act amidst all this sexual

57:39.988 --> 57:40.762
exploitation of women.

57:40.822 --> 57:42.495
And the climax of the film

57:42.557 --> 57:44.537
occurs when she stops in the

57:44.592 --> 57:45.935
middle of her performance...

57:53.868 --> 57:55.108
and looks straight at the

57:55.169 --> 57:56.273
audience, which means she looks

57:56.337 --> 57:57.338
straight at the camera

57:57.405 --> 57:58.405
and she says...

57:58.406 --> 57:59.680
I know you want me to tear my

57:59.774 --> 58:00.752
clothes off so you can look

58:00.775 --> 58:02.049
your 50 cents' worth.

58:02.110 --> 58:03.418
50 cents for the privilege

58:03.478 --> 58:04.599
of staring at a girl the way

58:04.646 --> 58:06.683
your wives won't let you.

58:06.748 --> 58:08.455
I'm sure they see through you

58:08.516 --> 58:09.893
just like we do.

58:09.951 --> 58:11.191
It's an extraordinary moment,

58:11.252 --> 58:13.095
in which we, as the audience,

58:13.154 --> 58:15.828
are confronted and asked to

58:15.890 --> 58:18.029
think about what we routinely

58:18.092 --> 58:19.537
see in movies, which is the

58:19.594 --> 58:21.232
sexual objectification of women.

58:23.665 --> 58:25.372
Weber and Arzner were

58:25.433 --> 58:26.912
very different women who made

58:26.968 --> 58:28.538
very different kinds of films in

58:28.603 --> 58:30.310
very different contexts, but if

58:30.371 --> 58:31.611
I think about it, what maybe

58:31.673 --> 58:34.586
unites them is that they had a

58:34.642 --> 58:36.519
unique and singular vision of

58:36.577 --> 58:37.817
what they could do that just

58:37.879 --> 58:40.758
allowed them to persevere.

58:40.815 --> 58:42.226
It's really important to have

58:42.283 --> 58:44.422
female filmmakers because women

58:44.485 --> 58:46.294
have a different perspective

58:46.354 --> 58:48.163
on the world, on our culture,

58:48.222 --> 58:49.599
on life.

58:49.657 --> 58:51.227
Women filmmakers, we have

58:51.292 --> 58:53.135
an awful lot to bring

58:53.194 --> 58:55.333
to the screen.

58:55.396 --> 58:56.739
There are not a whole lot of us

58:56.798 --> 58:59.210
and we have this nurturing

58:59.300 --> 59:01.541
quality and we have often a

59:01.569 --> 59:02.980
different point of view, a way

59:03.037 --> 59:04.243
of seeing the world, a different

59:04.305 --> 59:05.750
way of placing characters

59:05.807 --> 59:07.252
or placing the camera,

59:07.308 --> 59:09.185
so let's play around with that,

59:09.243 --> 59:10.722
let's experiment and that's...

59:10.778 --> 59:11.756
And I did that with Daughters

59:11.813 --> 59:12.621
of the Dust.

59:12.680 --> 59:13.784
And for a lot of people, it

59:13.848 --> 59:14.986
worked and for a lot of people,

59:15.049 --> 59:17.359
they said, "Whoa, what is this?"

59:18.063 --> 59:19.063
"What are you doing?"

59:19.087 --> 59:20.464
And it was like, "I'm exploring"

59:20.521 --> 59:24.594
and I'm telling a story my way."

59:38.506 --> 59:39.507
I was involved

59:39.574 --> 59:40.552
in getting Back to the Future

59:40.608 --> 59:42.519
put on the Film Registry.

59:42.577 --> 59:44.147
What did I tell you'?!

59:44.212 --> 59:48.058
88 Miles per hour!

59:48.116 --> 59:49.857
I went to the fans.

59:49.917 --> 59:51.055
Back to the future is one of

59:51.119 --> 59:52.291
my favorite movies.

59:52.353 --> 59:53.730
I had used a wonderful website,

59:53.788 --> 59:57.167
BTTF.com, that was hosted by a

59:57.225 --> 59:59.136
man named Stephen Clark and I

59:59.193 --> 01:00:00.866
wrote to him and said, "Look",

01:00:00.928 --> 01:00:03.067
fan response is an incredible

01:00:03.131 --> 01:00:04.735
factor in getting something on

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:07.143
the Registry and make your fans

01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:08.236
"write in."

01:00:08.302 --> 01:00:10.179
And the response was amazing.

01:00:10.238 --> 01:00:11.478
Steve Leggett, who works with

01:00:11.539 --> 01:00:12.609
the Film Registry, said that he

01:00:12.673 --> 01:00:14.448
had so many e-mails every day,

01:00:14.509 --> 01:00:15.817
hundreds of e-mails coming in,

01:00:15.877 --> 01:00:17.322
and it was the first time

01:00:17.378 --> 01:00:18.482
that there had been such an

01:00:18.546 --> 01:00:20.685
overwhelming response to getting

01:00:20.748 --> 01:00:22.728
one film on from people outside

01:00:22.784 --> 01:00:24.695
of the Library of Congress.

01:00:24.752 --> 01:00:26.197
It's found its way into the

01:00:26.254 --> 01:00:27.756
popular culture so much, and the

01:00:27.822 --> 01:00:29.102
fact that you can now buy a flux

01:00:29.157 --> 01:00:31.194
capacitor online... and people

01:00:31.259 --> 01:00:32.602
will buy them... is saying

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.638
something about the impact of

01:00:33.694 --> 01:00:34.866
the movie.

01:00:38.143 --> 01:00:39.143
My moment of

01:00:39.167 --> 01:00:40.544
triumph as far as the National.

01:00:40.601 --> 01:00:41.944
Film Registry is concerned...

01:00:42.003 --> 01:00:43.676
I had a couple of different ones

01:00:43.738 --> 01:00:44.614
that I put on there.

01:00:44.672 --> 01:00:45.946
The one film that I actually

01:00:46.007 --> 01:00:48.510
got chosen is a little

01:00:48.576 --> 01:00:49.111
film called...

01:00:49.177 --> 01:00:50.177
Let's all go

01:00:50.178 --> 01:00:51.987
to the lobby,

01:00:52.046 --> 01:00:54.788
let's all go to the lobby

01:00:54.849 --> 01:00:57.295
let's all go to the lobby

01:00:57.351 --> 01:00:58.557
to get ourselves a treat...

01:00:58.619 --> 01:00:59.825
A little film made by the.

01:00:59.921 --> 01:01:01.958
Filmack company up in Chicago.

01:01:01.989 --> 01:01:03.866
And it's a bumper that goes

01:01:03.925 --> 01:01:05.666
in between the movies to get you

01:01:05.726 --> 01:01:07.637
to go to the candy counter.

01:01:08.396 --> 01:01:09.602
The sparkling drinks

01:01:09.664 --> 01:01:11.268
are just dandy.

01:01:11.332 --> 01:01:12.436
The chocolate bars

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.945
and the candy.

01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:15.639
So let's all go to the...

01:01:15.703 --> 01:01:16.579
lobby,

01:01:16.637 --> 01:01:17.911
duh, duh, duddiluh, duh, duh.

01:01:17.972 --> 01:01:19.918
But I looked at it and was like,

01:01:19.974 --> 01:01:20.918
"This is such an important

01:01:20.975 --> 01:01:21.851
little piece of film."

01:01:21.909 --> 01:01:22.909
Everybody knows it,

01:01:22.944 --> 01:01:24.446
everybody's seen it.

01:01:24.512 --> 01:01:26.287
It's the perfect example of this

01:01:26.347 --> 01:01:28.122
kind of cinematic advertising

01:01:28.182 --> 01:01:29.889
that they were doing.

01:01:29.951 --> 01:01:31.225
And it's fun.

01:01:31.285 --> 01:01:33.094
So I put it in and sure enough,

01:01:33.154 --> 01:01:34.326
it got chosen that year.

01:01:34.388 --> 01:01:35.662
I was totally blown away.

01:01:35.723 --> 01:01:39.432
Let's all go to the lobby

01:01:39.493 --> 01:01:41.166
to get ourselves a treat...

01:01:41.996 --> 01:01:42.996
Thank you, thank you.

01:01:44.999 --> 01:01:46.171
When I was younger, I was

01:01:46.234 --> 01:01:47.941
interested in films about power.

01:01:53.507 --> 01:01:55.612
People with invincible skills.

01:01:55.676 --> 01:01:57.678
They could shoot a gun out of

01:01:57.745 --> 01:01:59.725
someone's hand, they could snap

01:01:59.814 --> 01:02:01.623
a bullwhip around your neck.

01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:04.592
This will remind you that

01:02:04.652 --> 01:02:05.653
I have been here once

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.630
and can return.

01:02:06.687 --> 01:02:10.134
And so from around six to 10,

01:02:10.191 --> 01:02:11.761
those were the staple of my

01:02:11.826 --> 01:02:13.499
imagination and you'd leave the

01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:15.302
movie and you'd be acting out

01:02:15.363 --> 01:02:17.138
all the parts with your friends.

01:02:26.007 --> 01:02:27.350
And as a matter of fact, on the

01:02:27.408 --> 01:02:29.354
first Western I ever did, I

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:31.048
ruined my first take on

01:02:31.112 --> 01:02:32.455
horseback where I'm shooting

01:02:32.513 --> 01:02:34.686
somebody with my pistol because

01:02:34.749 --> 01:02:36.023
on the finished film, you can

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:37.619
see me looking at the guy

01:02:37.685 --> 01:02:38.823
steely-eyed and pulling the

01:02:38.886 --> 01:02:39.886
trigger and going...

01:02:43.557 --> 01:02:45.230
Really stupid.

01:02:45.293 --> 01:02:47.000
But, you know, it shows you

01:02:47.061 --> 01:02:48.165
the grip that these things

01:02:48.229 --> 01:02:49.229
have on you.

01:02:55.136 --> 01:02:56.136
When I was young,

01:02:56.137 --> 01:02:57.241
when I was little, that was all

01:02:57.305 --> 01:02:58.079
I used to think about...

01:02:58.139 --> 01:02:59.174
the N.B.A.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:02:59.945
There's nothing more

01:03:00.007 --> 01:03:02.146
powerful than a true story,

01:03:02.209 --> 01:03:04.450
because it makes you feel

01:03:04.512 --> 01:03:07.288
like you don't have that escape

01:03:07.348 --> 01:03:09.089
valve that I have when I

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:10.322
watch fiction.

01:03:10.384 --> 01:03:12.660
When it gets too tough or too

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.098
close or too emotional, I can

01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:16.601
always kind of back out of it

01:03:16.657 --> 01:03:18.068
just a little bit by saying,

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:20.105
"Eh, this isn't true."

01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:21.265
And when you're seeing a

01:03:21.329 --> 01:03:23.275
powerful documentary, and you

01:03:23.331 --> 01:03:24.639
believe what you're seeing,

01:03:24.699 --> 01:03:25.837
you don't have that and

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.900
that's a good thing.

01:03:26.901 --> 01:03:28.471
My mother, she's

01:03:28.536 --> 01:03:31.312
like mother and father to me.

01:03:31.372 --> 01:03:33.318
She don't want me really hanging

01:03:33.374 --> 01:03:35.411
around over here that much,

01:03:35.476 --> 01:03:38.423
'cause of the gangs.

01:03:38.479 --> 01:03:40.049
I always wanted to make

01:03:40.114 --> 01:03:41.114
stories.

01:03:41.148 --> 01:03:42.354
This was a chance, an

01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:44.521
opportunity, to hopefully tell a

01:03:44.585 --> 01:03:46.428
great story, but a story that

01:03:46.487 --> 01:03:49.798
was true and a story that, in

01:03:49.857 --> 01:03:51.336
focusing on these two kids and

01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:52.894
their families, what their lives

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.270
had to say about the American

01:03:55.329 --> 01:03:58.833
dream, about race in America,

01:03:58.899 --> 01:04:01.675
about poverty in America.

01:04:01.769 --> 01:04:03.112
It's something I think that

01:04:03.137 --> 01:04:04.309
needed to be said, and

01:04:04.372 --> 01:04:05.373
needs to always be said,

01:04:05.439 --> 01:04:06.816
and unfortunately continues

01:04:06.874 --> 01:04:08.285
to need to be said.

01:04:08.342 --> 01:04:10.379
Arthur agee.

01:04:11.812 --> 01:04:13.416
I would say an influence

01:04:13.481 --> 01:04:15.620
for me early on was Barbara.

01:04:15.683 --> 01:04:17.458
Kopple's work, in particular,

01:04:17.518 --> 01:04:19.429
Harlan County.

01:04:19.487 --> 01:04:20.487
Come,

01:04:20.488 --> 01:04:23.594
all you young fellers,

01:04:23.657 --> 01:04:28.834
so brave and so fine...

01:04:28.896 --> 01:04:31.638
Seek not your fortune

01:04:31.699 --> 01:04:35.909
way down in the mine...

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.040
The beauty of

01:04:37.104 --> 01:04:38.515
documentaries is that it

01:04:38.572 --> 01:04:40.108
only happens once.

01:04:40.174 --> 01:04:42.381
It can't happen another time.

01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:45.151
I remember when I was with the

01:04:45.212 --> 01:04:46.953
widows from the Farmington Mine

01:04:47.014 --> 01:04:49.995
disaster in Harlan County.

01:04:50.051 --> 01:04:52.497
They had never gotten together

01:04:52.553 --> 01:04:55.500
to speak about what it meant

01:04:55.556 --> 01:04:57.558
to lose their husbands.

01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:59.536
This was the first time and they

01:04:59.627 --> 01:05:01.538
sat in a circle and they talked

01:05:01.562 --> 01:05:04.270
about the most intimate details

01:05:04.331 --> 01:05:05.867
of their husbands, of their

01:05:05.933 --> 01:05:07.708
lives, of what it meant to be

01:05:07.768 --> 01:05:09.179
a coal miner, what it meant

01:05:09.236 --> 01:05:10.681
to work in one of the most

01:05:10.738 --> 01:05:12.149
dangerous industries

01:05:12.206 --> 01:05:13.549
in this country.

01:05:13.607 --> 01:05:15.848
And one or two of them just

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:17.412
burst into tears.

01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:20.186
Another one got really angry.

01:05:20.247 --> 01:05:22.090
I live right almost on the

01:05:22.149 --> 01:05:23.787
seat of the main explosion,

01:05:23.851 --> 01:05:25.421
right there, and they said,

01:05:25.486 --> 01:05:27.227
"You get out of your house!"

01:05:27.288 --> 01:05:28.288
And the police told me

01:05:28.322 --> 01:05:29.096
to get out.

01:05:29.156 --> 01:05:30.156
Do you know why?

01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:31.101
Because they didn't want me

01:05:31.158 --> 01:05:32.296
to see what was going on up

01:05:32.359 --> 01:05:33.770
that damn, dirty, filthy mines!

01:05:33.828 --> 01:05:34.533
It's about

01:05:34.595 --> 01:05:35.630
communication.

01:05:35.696 --> 01:05:37.266
It's about connection.

01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:39.402
It's about stepping in to

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:41.276
somebody's world that you would

01:05:41.335 --> 01:05:43.372
never be privy to...

01:05:43.437 --> 01:05:46.850
And being able to be there and

01:05:46.907 --> 01:05:48.944
understand what's going on with

01:05:49.009 --> 01:05:50.818
them and who they are and what

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:52.289
they're about.

01:05:52.346 --> 01:05:54.223
I mean, nothing could be finer

01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:55.282
than that.

01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:57.693
And nothing else will do that.

01:06:02.923 --> 01:06:05.460
And if we don't save those films

01:06:05.526 --> 01:06:07.267
and preserve those films,

01:06:07.328 --> 01:06:09.604
we won't have a history.

01:06:13.367 --> 01:06:15.074
Film reconnects us

01:06:15.136 --> 01:06:16.581
to the world and to our

01:06:16.637 --> 01:06:19.618
experience of our lives in this

01:06:19.673 --> 01:06:21.311
space, in this time.

01:06:27.314 --> 01:06:29.692
1929's H20.

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:33.789
It is a short film about water,

01:06:33.854 --> 01:06:35.959
where the filmmaker starts from

01:06:36.023 --> 01:06:38.970
a distance and looks at water.

01:06:39.026 --> 01:06:40.562
Little trickles of water,

01:06:40.628 --> 01:06:42.266
little waterfalls,

01:06:42.329 --> 01:06:45.572
streams with the rocks visible.

01:06:45.633 --> 01:06:47.772
And he moves ever closer to the

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:50.179
water and the light playing on

01:06:50.237 --> 01:06:52.478
water to the degree that you no

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.749
longer recognize it as water.

01:06:55.809 --> 01:06:57.220
Then I guarantee, once you see

01:06:57.278 --> 01:06:58.814
this film, you never look

01:06:58.879 --> 01:07:01.587
at water the same way again.

01:07:01.682 --> 01:07:04.060
It's not meant to make sense.

01:07:04.084 --> 01:07:06.621
It's not meant to tell a story.

01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:08.098
But in many ways, it's meant

01:07:08.155 --> 01:07:10.897
to touch us the way poetry does.

01:07:13.827 --> 01:07:16.671
It is not always easy to engage

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:18.209
the experimental film.

01:07:22.503 --> 01:07:24.915
And one has to simply open one's

01:07:24.972 --> 01:07:27.418
self to the language of film.

01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:35.389
That's where the beauty lies.

01:07:35.449 --> 01:07:36.985
We, through the medium,

01:07:37.051 --> 01:07:41.261
we see the world anew.

01:07:41.322 --> 01:07:43.632
You know, the great thing

01:07:43.691 --> 01:07:44.999
about the Registry is that it's

01:07:45.059 --> 01:07:46.629
grown to be pretty diverse.

01:07:46.694 --> 01:07:47.695
It's gotten a lot more

01:07:47.761 --> 01:07:48.761
inclusive, you know.

01:07:48.796 --> 01:07:50.503
There's a lot of experimental,

01:07:50.564 --> 01:07:51.804
avant-garde and independent

01:07:51.865 --> 01:07:52.434
films.

01:07:52.499 --> 01:07:53.375
There's lots of

01:07:53.434 --> 01:07:54.208
documentary films.

01:07:54.268 --> 01:07:54.939
There's home movies.

01:07:55.002 --> 01:07:56.948
There even are a few industrial

01:07:57.004 --> 01:07:58.483
and educational films.

01:07:58.539 --> 01:07:59.984
There was a turtle

01:08:00.074 --> 01:08:02.020
by the name of Bert.

01:08:02.042 --> 01:08:03.248
And Bert the turtle

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:05.221
was very alert.

01:08:05.279 --> 01:08:06.883
When danger threatened him

01:08:06.947 --> 01:08:08.585
he never got hurt.

01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:10.890
He knew just what to do.

01:08:11.785 --> 01:08:13.093
He'd duck

01:08:13.153 --> 01:08:14.427
and cover...

01:08:14.488 --> 01:08:15.967
This country has always been

01:08:16.023 --> 01:08:17.229
about persuasion.

01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:18.792
Really most societies are.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:20.304
And these films really

01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:21.600
illuminate that, kind of the

01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:22.834
changing history of what

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:24.136
we were told.

01:08:24.198 --> 01:08:25.301
We must be ready

01:08:25.366 --> 01:08:27.642
every day, all the time, to do

01:08:27.701 --> 01:08:29.475
the right thing if the atomic

01:08:29.536 --> 01:08:31.277
bomb explodes.

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:33.578
Duck and cover!

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.551
This family knows what to do,

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.953
just as your own family should.

01:08:40.814 --> 01:08:42.259
The House in the Middle is a

01:08:42.316 --> 01:08:43.988
goofy and rather marvelous film

01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:47.055
made in about 1953, '54 by...

01:08:47.121 --> 01:08:48.395
let me see if I can get it

01:08:48.455 --> 01:08:50.298
right... the National Clean Up-

01:08:50.357 --> 01:08:52.359
Paint Up-Fix Up Committee, in

01:08:52.426 --> 01:08:53.631
association with the Federal.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:55.264
CML Defense Administration.

01:08:55.328 --> 01:08:56.831
And it puts forth a really,

01:08:56.897 --> 01:08:59.241
really odd message.

01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:00.332
Three identical

01:09:00.334 --> 01:09:01.836
miniature frame houses.

01:09:01.902 --> 01:09:02.937
The house on the right,

01:09:03.002 --> 01:09:04.413
an eyesore.

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:05.711
But you've seen these same

01:09:05.773 --> 01:09:08.845
conditions in your own hometown.

01:09:08.908 --> 01:09:09.944
This house is the product

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:11.386
of years of neglect.

01:09:11.444 --> 01:09:12.515
It has not been painted

01:09:12.578 --> 01:09:14.957
regularly.

01:09:15.015 --> 01:09:16.050
The house in the middle,

01:09:16.116 --> 01:09:17.754
in good condition, with a clean,

01:09:17.818 --> 01:09:19.296
unlittered yard.

01:09:19.353 --> 01:09:20.923
If your

01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:22.729
house is freshly painted and

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.359
clean and doesn't have a lot

01:09:24.425 --> 01:09:25.768
of crap sitting around in

01:09:25.826 --> 01:09:27.395
the front yard, you're a lot

01:09:27.461 --> 01:09:28.769
more likely to survive

01:09:28.828 --> 01:09:30.001
a nuclear attack.

01:09:39.206 --> 01:09:40.366
So it really makes kind of

01:09:40.407 --> 01:09:42.353
a moral argument, a behavioral

01:09:42.408 --> 01:09:43.979
argument for surviving

01:09:44.044 --> 01:09:45.580
nuclear attack.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:46.750
Two houses are

01:09:46.814 --> 01:09:48.292
a total loss, but the well-kept

01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:49.349
and the painted house

01:09:49.383 --> 01:09:51.328
in the middle still stands.

01:09:51.385 --> 01:09:52.385
Of course it's funded by

01:09:52.386 --> 01:09:53.831
the paint industry, so they're

01:09:53.886 --> 01:09:55.662
trying to sell house paint and

01:09:55.723 --> 01:09:56.758
saying, "Hey, it's gonna help"

01:09:56.824 --> 01:09:58.531
you survive nuclear attack."

01:09:58.592 --> 01:10:00.128
I mean, this is, you know...

01:10:00.194 --> 01:10:02.834
This is a little weird.

01:10:02.896 --> 01:10:05.206
The dingy house on the left,

01:10:05.265 --> 01:10:06.676
the dirty and littered house

01:10:06.734 --> 01:10:08.873
on the right, or the clean white

01:10:08.936 --> 01:10:10.381
house in the middle.

01:10:10.437 --> 01:10:12.439
It is your choice.

01:10:12.506 --> 01:10:15.612
The reward may be survival.

01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:19.422
Every movie that is popular,

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.017
every movie that is popular

01:10:22.082 --> 01:10:25.791
captures something of the ideas

01:10:25.853 --> 01:10:28.197
that were alive at the time.

01:10:28.255 --> 01:10:30.235
And very often, the ideas that

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:32.861
they capture and that make them

01:10:32.926 --> 01:10:35.372
so acceptable to the public

01:10:35.429 --> 01:10:36.840
are lies.

01:10:40.601 --> 01:10:42.877
This is D.W. Griffith's film.

01:10:42.936 --> 01:10:45.212
Essentially, Griffith, right

01:10:45.272 --> 01:10:46.751
then and there, invented a lot

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:48.377
of the grammar of film.

01:10:48.442 --> 01:10:51.013
Its aesthetic and historical

01:10:51.078 --> 01:10:52.148
significance from the point of

01:10:52.212 --> 01:10:54.692
view of film is beyond debate.

01:10:54.748 --> 01:10:56.625
Its value as a portrayal

01:10:56.683 --> 01:10:58.128
of American history is not

01:10:58.185 --> 01:10:59.562
at all beyond debate.

01:10:59.653 --> 01:11:02.190
It is basically a pro Ku Klux.

01:11:02.222 --> 01:11:04.168
Klan view of what happened

01:11:04.224 --> 01:11:05.224
in the South.

01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:16.146
I think The Birth of a Nation

01:11:16.203 --> 01:11:18.444
really legitimized the motion

01:11:18.505 --> 01:11:19.142
picture industry.

01:11:19.206 --> 01:11:20.344
It was the first film to be

01:11:20.407 --> 01:11:22.011
shown at legitimate Broadway

01:11:22.075 --> 01:11:23.075
theaters.

01:11:23.076 --> 01:11:24.054
I think for the first time,

01:11:24.111 --> 01:11:25.784
people realized almost not only

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.154
the power of the motion picture,

01:11:27.214 --> 01:11:28.318
but also almost the danger

01:11:28.382 --> 01:11:29.452
of the motion picture.

01:11:29.516 --> 01:11:31.518
What it could accomplish.

01:11:31.585 --> 01:11:34.156
Unfortunately, all these

01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:36.462
innovative ideas were used

01:11:36.523 --> 01:11:38.730
to advance the notion of

01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:40.931
segregation, Jim Crow, racism,

01:11:40.994 --> 01:11:42.940
racial bias.

01:11:42.996 --> 01:11:45.169
It was a dangerous film and it

01:11:45.232 --> 01:11:48.702
caused a lot of personal harm

01:11:48.769 --> 01:11:50.646
to people after it came out

01:11:50.704 --> 01:11:51.944
during that time.

01:11:52.005 --> 01:11:53.109
Birth of a Nation was

01:11:53.173 --> 01:11:54.294
propaganda, you know, and it

01:11:54.341 --> 01:11:55.513
was slander, but it's important

01:11:55.576 --> 01:11:56.111
to recognize.

01:11:56.176 --> 01:11:57.297
I think by ignoring it or by

01:11:57.344 --> 01:11:58.789
denying, you know, the existence

01:11:58.846 --> 01:11:59.967
of Birth of a Nation, you're

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:00.981
almost losing a piece

01:12:01.014 --> 01:12:04.120
of cinema history.

01:12:04.184 --> 01:12:05.390
So we'll find them

01:12:05.452 --> 01:12:07.454
in the end, I promise you,

01:12:07.521 --> 01:12:09.694
we'll find them.

01:12:09.756 --> 01:12:11.997
Just as sure as the turning

01:12:12.059 --> 01:12:13.436
of the earth.

01:12:13.494 --> 01:12:14.996
I know the generation of

01:12:15.062 --> 01:12:18.407
people that saw The Searchers

01:12:18.465 --> 01:12:20.638
when they were young will never

01:12:20.701 --> 01:12:22.044
forget it.

01:12:22.102 --> 01:12:24.981
It was essentially about a man,

01:12:25.038 --> 01:12:26.949
played by John Wayne, who comes

01:12:27.007 --> 01:12:30.352
to save a little girl

01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:32.913
who has been kidnapped

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:39.488
by an Indian tribe.

01:12:39.553 --> 01:12:40.759
It's always the menacing

01:12:40.821 --> 01:12:44.496
music, the menacing war paint

01:12:44.558 --> 01:12:46.162
that was assigned

01:12:46.226 --> 01:12:49.036
to these characters.

01:12:49.096 --> 01:12:50.096
[Shouting in

01:12:53.634 --> 01:12:54.669
Growing up, if you look back

01:12:54.735 --> 01:12:55.713
at all the cowboy and Indian

01:12:55.769 --> 01:12:56.975
stuff I watched as a kid,

01:12:57.037 --> 01:12:59.074
why were we the heroes?

01:12:59.139 --> 01:13:00.345
I didn't quite get that.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.640
Took me a long time to realize

01:13:01.642 --> 01:13:02.682
that, even when you played

01:13:02.743 --> 01:13:03.483
cowboys and Indians

01:13:03.544 --> 01:13:04.113
with your friends.

01:13:04.177 --> 01:13:05.019
Today, I'd want to be

01:13:05.078 --> 01:13:06.148
the Indian, they're the rebels.

01:13:06.213 --> 01:13:07.715
And I would be for the Indians

01:13:07.781 --> 01:13:09.021
against the cowboys.

01:13:10.183 --> 01:13:12.527
I saw The Searchers with

01:13:12.586 --> 01:13:14.463
an American Indian and I was

01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:16.000
unaware of the racism in the

01:13:16.056 --> 01:13:17.399
film until I was sitting next

01:13:17.457 --> 01:13:18.868
to her and she just stormed out

01:13:18.926 --> 01:13:20.701
at a certain scene in the movie.

01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:21.921
And I went out to follow her,

01:13:21.962 --> 01:13:22.906
I said, "What's going on'?"

01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:23.737
She said, "Did you see"

01:13:23.797 --> 01:13:24.797
the movie'?"

01:13:24.798 --> 01:13:25.798
I said, "Yeah, I saw it."

01:13:25.799 --> 01:13:26.436
"Well, did you see

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.308
what happened?"

01:13:27.367 --> 01:13:29.176
These are my people...

01:13:30.637 --> 01:13:31.877
Go!

01:13:31.939 --> 01:13:34.749
Go, Martin, please!

01:13:34.808 --> 01:13:36.719
Stand aside, Martin.

01:13:36.777 --> 01:13:38.120
So he was searching for her

01:13:38.178 --> 01:13:40.658
so he could kill her, so she

01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:42.523
wouldn't have to live with them.

01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:44.085
Because she was living a fate

01:13:44.151 --> 01:13:45.858
worse than death.

01:13:48.388 --> 01:13:49.992
It was very disturbing.

01:13:50.057 --> 01:13:53.834
Ethan, no, you don't!

01:13:53.894 --> 01:13:55.669
Stand aside.

01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:57.265
I thought that was really

01:13:57.331 --> 01:13:59.140
something that I really wouldn't

01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:01.008
want my daughter to look at.

01:14:02.936 --> 01:14:05.678
It really helped create

01:14:05.739 --> 01:14:09.243
a persona about Indian people

01:14:09.309 --> 01:14:16.659
that continues to this day.

01:14:16.717 --> 01:14:19.220
The exiles was made about.

01:14:19.286 --> 01:14:21.288
Native Americans living in

01:14:21.355 --> 01:14:23.494
Los Angeles in the 1950s,

01:14:23.557 --> 01:14:25.059
in other words, Native Americans

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:26.604
not out in the desert or

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:28.367
in the mountains, in the kind

01:14:28.428 --> 01:14:30.430
of environment that most people

01:14:30.497 --> 01:14:32.499
in cliched terms think of,

01:14:32.566 --> 01:14:35.342
but trying to survive in

01:14:35.402 --> 01:14:37.177
a brutal urban environment.

01:14:39.106 --> 01:14:40.847
The Exiles really put kind

01:14:40.907 --> 01:14:43.945
of a face on Indian people

01:14:44.011 --> 01:14:45.513
at the time.

01:14:45.579 --> 01:14:47.024
During that time period, it was

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.616
either relocation or maybe

01:14:48.682 --> 01:14:52.323
serving in the armed services.

01:14:52.386 --> 01:14:54.263
A lot of Indian people left the

01:14:54.321 --> 01:14:57.632
reservations and came to cities

01:14:57.691 --> 01:15:00.638
and met other Indian people.

01:15:00.727 --> 01:15:02.434
It showed kind of the truth

01:15:02.462 --> 01:15:05.068
of living in an urban area

01:15:05.132 --> 01:15:07.772
as far as the isolation,

01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:09.541
depicted in the young woman.

01:15:09.603 --> 01:15:12.174
She's always seen to be alone

01:15:12.239 --> 01:15:15.186
and longing for a better life.

01:15:15.242 --> 01:15:18.121
Film very much is important

01:15:18.178 --> 01:15:20.954
in depiction of a people.

01:15:21.014 --> 01:15:21.788
Yo, what's your problem, man?

01:15:21.848 --> 01:15:22.656
Y'all are brothers, you ain't

01:15:22.716 --> 01:15:23.387
supposed to be fighting

01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:24.450
each other.

01:15:24.451 --> 01:15:25.589
Little punk.

01:15:25.652 --> 01:15:28.394
Get off my porch, mama's boy.

01:15:28.455 --> 01:15:29.957
When Boyz in the Hood as

01:15:30.023 --> 01:15:31.627
a document of its time, it's

01:15:31.692 --> 01:15:33.000
a document of what was going on

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:34.539
in that time period.

01:15:34.594 --> 01:15:35.834
You have to think, young

01:15:35.896 --> 01:15:37.534
brother, about your future.

01:15:37.597 --> 01:15:38.597
It gave a voice

01:15:38.598 --> 01:15:40.509
to the voiceless.

01:15:40.567 --> 01:15:41.567
Listen, I want to do

01:15:41.601 --> 01:15:42.306
something with my life,

01:15:42.369 --> 01:15:43.109
all right?

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:44.342
I want to be somebody.

01:15:44.404 --> 01:15:45.075
The film, for me,

01:15:45.138 --> 01:15:47.175
it's like my diary.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.379
Ricky!

01:15:49.443 --> 01:15:50.564
It was a cathartic thing for

01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:53.147
me to show where I was from and

01:15:53.213 --> 01:15:54.851
what I'd gone through.

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:58.352
Film is a reflection of the

01:15:58.418 --> 01:16:00.364
times of which we live in,

01:16:00.454 --> 01:16:02.400
good or bad.

01:16:06.593 --> 01:16:09.005
I was responsible for pushing

01:16:09.062 --> 01:16:10.735
forward Birth of a Nation into

01:16:10.797 --> 01:16:12.538
the Film Preservation Board.

01:16:12.599 --> 01:16:14.579
That movie led to the deaths of

01:16:14.634 --> 01:16:16.170
many, many black people through

01:16:16.236 --> 01:16:18.375
lynching, through enacting laws,

01:16:18.438 --> 01:16:20.349
segregation, through Jim Crow

01:16:20.407 --> 01:16:21.442
and everything.

01:16:21.508 --> 01:16:23.181
But it really shows the power

01:16:23.243 --> 01:16:25.280
of film for evil as well

01:16:25.345 --> 01:16:26.345
as good.

01:16:31.351 --> 01:16:32.694
When you watch a movie

01:16:32.753 --> 01:16:34.061
from the past, you're involved

01:16:34.121 --> 01:16:35.429
in a dialogue.

01:16:35.489 --> 01:16:36.763
A dialogue between past

01:16:36.823 --> 01:16:38.530
and present.

01:16:38.592 --> 01:16:39.832
There's what's up on the screen

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.941
and then there's the person

01:16:40.961 --> 01:16:42.269
looking at it and every person

01:16:42.329 --> 01:16:43.672
who looks at it brings their own

01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:44.936
history and finds their own

01:16:44.998 --> 01:16:46.136
value in it.

01:16:57.577 --> 01:16:58.647
You look at every war that

01:16:58.712 --> 01:17:00.020
we've been through and whether

01:17:00.113 --> 01:17:01.956
it's a war that we won, like the

01:17:01.982 --> 01:17:04.428
good war, World War II, or a war

01:17:04.484 --> 01:17:06.964
we lost, like Vietnam, a war

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.091
like what's going on now in Iraq

01:17:09.156 --> 01:17:10.356
and Afghanistan where we don't

01:17:10.357 --> 01:17:11.665
know what the result is going

01:17:11.725 --> 01:17:14.171
to be, the result is the same

01:17:14.227 --> 01:17:15.604
on the people who fought it.

01:17:15.662 --> 01:17:17.699
And I think that's important

01:17:17.764 --> 01:17:18.764
for people to understand.

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:24.370
The best years of our

01:17:24.371 --> 01:17:26.977
lives is about three G.L.S

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.576
returning from service to their

01:17:28.642 --> 01:17:31.714
hometown.

01:17:31.778 --> 01:17:33.018
I enlisted in the Army Air.

01:17:33.079 --> 01:17:34.615
Corps, I was a bombardier

01:17:34.681 --> 01:17:36.251
in a B-17.

01:17:36.316 --> 01:17:37.920
I was no hero, but I was there,

01:17:37.984 --> 01:17:39.258
I did the job.

01:17:39.319 --> 01:17:40.491
Naturally, it hit me

01:17:40.554 --> 01:17:42.033
particularly hard when Dana

01:17:42.088 --> 01:17:43.590
Andrews playing the bombardier

01:17:43.657 --> 01:17:45.568
goes out to a field where

01:17:45.625 --> 01:17:47.798
they're cocooning old b-17

01:17:47.861 --> 01:17:51.570
bombers, and he approaches one

01:17:51.631 --> 01:17:53.736
and climbs back up into it.

01:17:57.737 --> 01:17:59.717
And the sound comes up and

01:17:59.806 --> 01:18:03.117
the filmmaking makes him

01:18:03.143 --> 01:18:05.953
experience a bombing raid.

01:18:06.012 --> 01:18:07.753
And the sound is extraordinary.

01:18:16.223 --> 01:18:19.067
That had a particular meaning

01:18:19.125 --> 01:18:21.571
for anybody who was in a bomber.

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:26.734
Hey, you!

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.801
What're you doing

01:18:27.868 --> 01:18:29.040
in that airplane?

01:18:29.102 --> 01:18:33.676
It had a great effect on me.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:35.742
The movies create order out of

01:18:35.809 --> 01:18:37.652
the chaos of our lives and

01:18:37.711 --> 01:18:39.156
that's what this was.

01:18:49.222 --> 01:18:50.724
I was the last person that

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:52.167
I ever would have thought would

01:18:52.225 --> 01:18:54.262
have gone to war.

01:18:54.327 --> 01:18:55.829
War scared me when I was young.

01:18:58.565 --> 01:19:01.375
After I came back from Vietnam,

01:19:01.468 --> 01:19:04.312
I gave away my uniforms,

01:19:04.337 --> 01:19:05.509
I really put the whole thing

01:19:05.572 --> 01:19:06.346
behind me.

01:19:06.406 --> 01:19:07.578
I just thought I could shut the

01:19:07.641 --> 01:19:09.484
door and move on with my life.

01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:10.953
I don't guess I spoke with

01:19:11.011 --> 01:19:12.115
another veteran or about

01:19:12.178 --> 01:19:14.488
my experience for eight

01:19:14.547 --> 01:19:15.651
or nine years.

01:19:15.715 --> 01:19:18.855
By chance I was put in touch

01:19:18.919 --> 01:19:21.900
with a guy who worked with

01:19:21.955 --> 01:19:23.730
veterans and he invited me to

01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:25.098
a screening of The Deer Hunter.

01:19:25.158 --> 01:19:27.160
[Chopin nocturne playing

01:19:35.368 --> 01:19:36.779
Really discovered that the

01:19:36.836 --> 01:19:37.996
issues that they were dealing

01:19:38.004 --> 01:19:40.109
with in that film, how

01:19:40.173 --> 01:19:41.413
frightened those guys were once

01:19:41.441 --> 01:19:42.441
they got over there.

01:19:42.442 --> 01:19:43.642
They went over there with such

01:19:43.677 --> 01:19:45.156
enthusiasm and such honest,

01:19:45.211 --> 01:19:46.781
just sincere patriotism and

01:19:46.846 --> 01:19:48.257
discovered themselves just

01:19:48.315 --> 01:19:51.125
in this chaotic world.

01:19:51.184 --> 01:19:55.758
[Explosions, machine gun fire,

01:20:02.162 --> 01:20:04.733
It really, to me, emotionally

01:20:04.798 --> 01:20:05.798
hit home.

01:20:05.832 --> 01:20:07.402
How that stays with you.

01:20:07.467 --> 01:20:08.673
Once you've been through that.

01:20:08.735 --> 01:20:10.942
Mike?

01:20:11.004 --> 01:20:13.041
It's... it's like something

01:20:13.106 --> 01:20:16.349
that, um...

01:20:16.409 --> 01:20:17.888
A human shouldn't

01:20:17.944 --> 01:20:19.617
have to experience.

01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:23.252
That... that loss of control.

01:20:23.316 --> 01:20:25.455
That having, really having to

01:20:25.518 --> 01:20:27.930
give up on life, because you

01:20:27.988 --> 01:20:29.558
don't know that you're gonna be

01:20:29.622 --> 01:20:34.401
alive in an hour... in a day...

01:20:34.461 --> 01:20:36.839
And that's, it's just something

01:20:36.896 --> 01:20:38.398
that doesn't...

01:20:38.465 --> 01:20:41.139
That doesn't go away.

01:20:41.201 --> 01:20:42.703
It's a good thing that films

01:20:42.769 --> 01:20:45.375
like Deer Hunter were made,

01:20:45.438 --> 01:20:46.746
because it's an honest

01:20:46.806 --> 01:20:48.945
representation of the emotion

01:20:49.009 --> 01:20:51.546
of war, and I think people need

01:20:51.611 --> 01:20:53.056
to know that.

01:20:53.113 --> 01:20:55.889
We should not go to war easily

01:20:55.949 --> 01:21:00.227
because the impact on people's

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.856
lives is permanent.

01:21:07.927 --> 01:21:09.531
Film captured me,

01:21:09.596 --> 01:21:11.075
as it does so many people,

01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:12.439
when I was a kid.

01:21:16.202 --> 01:21:18.341
As a child, there were no good

01:21:18.405 --> 01:21:19.281
movies or bad movies.

01:21:19.339 --> 01:21:20.340
There were just movies.

01:21:28.148 --> 01:21:29.354
I grew up in a very poor

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:31.225
family and I think going to the

01:21:31.284 --> 01:21:33.628
movie theater, the old walk-in

01:21:33.686 --> 01:21:34.994
theater that cost maybe

01:21:35.055 --> 01:21:37.331
20 cents...

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:39.131
It was the window to the world.

01:21:39.192 --> 01:21:40.569
It largely took me, I think,

01:21:40.627 --> 01:21:43.938
took me out of my own life.

01:21:43.997 --> 01:21:45.101
So for a dime, I could

01:21:45.165 --> 01:21:47.167
go and stay there all day and

01:21:47.233 --> 01:21:49.713
watch three pictures and Pathé.

01:21:49.769 --> 01:21:52.375
News and Mickey Mouse.

01:21:52.439 --> 01:21:54.214
So my outlook was to watch film,

01:21:54.274 --> 01:21:56.982
any film, and I did.

01:21:57.043 --> 01:21:58.283
I loved them all

01:21:58.344 --> 01:22:00.381
and I still do today.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.289
I just loved the glamour of

01:22:02.315 --> 01:22:05.023
life in film from the '30s and

01:22:05.085 --> 01:22:07.531
'40s, like I wanted to have all

01:22:07.587 --> 01:22:09.498
those glittering costumes and

01:22:09.556 --> 01:22:11.467
I wanted Cary Grant to take me

01:22:11.524 --> 01:22:13.765
out to dinner, but the closest

01:22:13.827 --> 01:22:17.240
thing I have is film.

01:22:17.297 --> 01:22:18.640
This is an art.

01:22:18.698 --> 01:22:19.870
It's not just how to make money,

01:22:19.933 --> 01:22:21.537
it's not just what we can sell

01:22:21.601 --> 01:22:23.274
it as, but it's something

01:22:23.336 --> 01:22:25.942
valuable that we should save.

01:22:26.005 --> 01:22:27.177
This is part of who we are

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.617
as a culture and we need

01:22:28.675 --> 01:22:29.312
to preserve it.

01:22:29.375 --> 01:22:31.252
It's not a matter of, like,

01:22:31.311 --> 01:22:32.221
"Should we?"

01:22:32.278 --> 01:22:35.088
It's "How are we going to?"

01:22:35.148 --> 01:22:36.923
We've got a job to preserve

01:22:36.983 --> 01:22:38.656
the aspirations and the images

01:22:38.718 --> 01:22:39.958
and the ideals and dreams of

01:22:40.019 --> 01:22:41.692
millions and millions of people.

01:22:41.754 --> 01:22:43.028
I think one thing we can say

01:22:43.089 --> 01:22:44.568
is that 500 or a thousand years

01:22:44.624 --> 01:22:45.830
from now, when people want to

01:22:45.892 --> 01:22:47.098
know what life was like,

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.366
they will go to movies.

01:22:48.428 --> 01:22:49.634
They will go to the moving image

01:22:49.696 --> 01:22:51.141
materials that we created first,

01:22:51.197 --> 01:22:52.335
because those are the time

01:22:52.398 --> 01:22:54.537
capsules of our era.

01:22:54.601 --> 01:22:56.171
They are now being preserved

01:22:56.236 --> 01:22:58.011
and restored so that when we're

01:22:58.071 --> 01:22:59.607
all long gone, as long as

01:22:59.706 --> 01:23:00.912
there's something to watch films

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:02.078
with, they'll be able to see

01:23:02.142 --> 01:23:03.587
these things.

01:23:03.643 --> 01:23:04.849
The beauty of film is that

01:23:04.911 --> 01:23:06.117
it's everybody's.

01:23:06.179 --> 01:23:07.886
It's not just the socially

01:23:07.947 --> 01:23:10.325
elite, it's everybody's.

01:23:14.187 --> 01:23:15.188
Somebody says, "Why would you"

01:23:15.255 --> 01:23:17.360
save movies?"

01:23:17.423 --> 01:23:19.425
Well, I'd ask those people back,

01:23:19.492 --> 01:23:20.300
"Why do you save

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.498
your family pictures?"

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.105
As a society, we want to do

01:23:29.169 --> 01:23:30.169
the same thing.

01:23:30.203 --> 01:23:32.410
We want to say who were we,

01:23:32.472 --> 01:23:34.577
where are we now and what do we

01:23:34.641 --> 01:23:35.915
want people in the future

01:23:35.975 --> 01:23:37.716
to think about us?

01:23:37.777 --> 01:23:39.450
It's our family album.

01:24:14.414 --> 01:24:15.916
It is absolutely

01:24:15.982 --> 01:24:18.428
imperative that we save the art

01:24:18.484 --> 01:24:21.693
form of the 20th century.

01:24:21.754 --> 01:24:23.563
I mean, how can we not?

01:24:33.166 --> 01:24:36.739
Here's looking at you, kid.

01:24:36.803 --> 01:24:38.510
Elaine!

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:41.797
Let's all go

01:27:41.821 --> 01:27:43.630
to the lobby,

01:27:43.689 --> 01:27:46.397
let's all go to the lobby.

01:27:46.459 --> 01:27:49.201
Let's all go to the lobby

01:27:49.262 --> 01:27:52.004
to get ourselves a treat.

01:27:52.064 --> 01:27:53.168
Delicious things

01:27:53.232 --> 01:27:54.836
to eat.

01:27:54.901 --> 01:27:56.005
The popcorn can't

01:27:56.068 --> 01:27:57.604
be beat.

01:27:57.670 --> 01:27:58.478
The sparkling

01:27:58.538 --> 01:28:00.643
drinks are just dandy.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.844
The chocolate bars

01:28:01.874 --> 01:28:03.114
and the candy.

01:28:03.176 --> 01:28:06.385
So, let's all go to the lobby

01:28:06.446 --> 01:28:09.427
to get ourselves a treat.

01:28:09.482 --> 01:28:13.487
Let's all go to the lobby

01:28:13.553 --> 01:28:17.023
to get ourselves a treat...
