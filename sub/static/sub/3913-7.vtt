13:51.745 --> 13:55.148
Come on, that's an antique.

13:55.149 --> 13:56.949
Weather vane.

13:56.950 --> 13:58.851
[gunshots]

14:03.190 --> 14:05.058
She gets the job done.

14:05.059 --> 14:06.626
I guess so.

14:06.627 --> 14:07.860
What's your name?

14:07.861 --> 14:10.997
Ranikar, but you can call me Zera.

14:10.998 --> 14:14.000
All right, Zero, you can shoot.
Who taught you?

14:14.001 --> 14:15.501
My dad.

14:15.502 --> 14:18.704
I built him that gun myself
from scrap parts and old metal.

14:18.705 --> 14:20.940
Took me three months
to get the scope right.

14:20.941 --> 14:22.208
I'm Indur, by the way.

14:22.209 --> 14:24.043
Good to have you here.

14:24.044 --> 14:26.546
Thank you. So this is it?

14:26.547 --> 14:27.780
This is all you got?

14:27.781 --> 14:29.882
We're in the process of building.

14:41.361 --> 14:43.462
Bebe!

14:46.533 --> 14:47.971
_

14:52.025 --> 14:53.080
_

14:54.112 --> 14:57.115
_

15:00.222 --> 15:03.243
_

15:12.280 --> 15:13.647
That's it, come on.

15:13.702 --> 15:15.002
- Pick those legs up.
- Four!

15:15.003 --> 15:18.506
- Let's go. That's better.
- Five!

15:18.507 --> 15:20.808
- All right, good.
- Six!

15:20.809 --> 15:23.144
- Seven!
- Let's go, people.

15:23.145 --> 15:24.879
- Eight!
- What are you doing?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.280
- Where's your daughter?
- Nine!

15:26.281 --> 15:27.815
- What?
- I asked you a question.

15:27.816 --> 15:30.117
- Where's your daughter?
- Ten!

15:30.118 --> 15:32.420
I don't have time for your questions.

15:32.421 --> 15:34.288
I'm trying to get people
ready for battle.

15:34.289 --> 15:35.523
Don't waste my time!

15:35.524 --> 15:37.058
I am going to keep wasting your time

15:37.059 --> 15:38.793
until you give me a straight answer.

15:38.794 --> 15:40.717
_

15:40.862 --> 15:42.148
Most of these kids have read

15:42.149 --> 15:44.255
<i>The Amazing Goddess of the Badlands.</i>

15:44.256 --> 15:45.051
_

15:45.379 --> 15:46.742
_

15:48.790 --> 15:50.660
And I want to know where she is.

15:51.316 --> 15:54.118
Why isn't the Amazing Goddess
fighting by their side?

15:56.354 --> 15:59.823
My daughter's been
through a lot recently.

15:59.824 --> 16:03.961
Right now she's not capable
of picking up a weapon.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.530
But my child is?

16:06.531 --> 16:08.565
And you should know
we're not the only recruits

16:08.566 --> 16:10.000
asking these questions.

16:10.001 --> 16:13.203
Many among us think the
Votanis Collective

16:13.204 --> 16:14.505
is a human problem.

16:14.506 --> 16:17.841
Really? Really, a human problem?

16:17.842 --> 16:19.443
And they believe that Rahm Tak

16:19.444 --> 16:23.013
would treat the Votans with
kindness if he took Defiance.

16:23.014 --> 16:24.014
That's a fantasy.

16:24.015 --> 16:25.482
That's what some believe.

16:25.483 --> 16:26.984
Do you believe that?

16:28.353 --> 16:29.987
Do you believe that?

16:29.988 --> 16:32.790
I believe that if your family isn't going

16:32.791 --> 16:36.160
to fight for Defiance,
then neither is mine.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.634
Sorry. He's my dad.

16:46.204 --> 16:48.038
Anyone else?

16:57.182 --> 16:59.917
Keep them moving. Let's go.

16:59.918 --> 17:02.386
Okay, and...

17:02.387 --> 17:07.691
16, 17, 18!

17:12.430 --> 17:14.397
Thank you for coming.

17:24.563 --> 17:26.897
What happened to you?

17:26.898 --> 17:29.868
Spent the day in basic training.

17:29.869 --> 17:32.937
Nolan's whipping us into shape
to face your good pal Rahm Tak.

17:32.938 --> 17:36.741
Rahm's no friend of mine.

17:36.742 --> 17:37.909
Any word of your mother?

17:37.910 --> 17:41.046
They haven't caught her yet.

17:41.047 --> 17:44.983
They never will. She's too smart.

17:44.984 --> 17:47.118
Where's my grandson?

17:47.119 --> 17:48.620
Home.

17:48.621 --> 17:50.221
Ignoring a condemned man's wishes,

17:50.222 --> 17:53.591
it's kind of petty, don't you think?

17:53.592 --> 17:55.293
You helped Rahm Tak,

17:55.294 --> 17:57.629
and now that psychopath
is coming for us,

17:57.630 --> 17:59.564
and if we can't fight him off,

17:59.565 --> 18:02.567
well, then my half-human child

18:02.568 --> 18:04.002
is going to be brutally murdered.

18:04.003 --> 18:07.505
So, no, Dad, Luke will not
be visiting you ever.

18:07.506 --> 18:09.274
I had no choice.

18:09.275 --> 18:10.642
There's always a choice.

18:10.643 --> 18:12.577
Look, the minute you got home,

18:12.578 --> 18:14.245
you and Mom should have
warned Nolan and Amanda.

18:14.246 --> 18:16.214
You were Rahm's hostage.
He would have killed you.

18:16.215 --> 18:17.382
I escaped.

18:17.383 --> 18:20.285
Well, how was I supposed
to know that would happen?

18:20.286 --> 18:22.954
You know, even if Rahm Tak
had killed me, so what?

18:22.955 --> 18:26.191
I would have died protecting
my child and my home.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.293
I'd be with Christie now.

18:28.294 --> 18:31.129
My death would have meaning.

18:31.130 --> 18:35.099
You... you should have told the truth.

18:36.168 --> 18:38.303
You and Mom should have helped.

18:38.304 --> 18:40.972
Don't leave. Please, wait.

18:40.973 --> 18:45.043
I've failed you, Alak.
I've failed our family.

18:45.044 --> 18:48.046
If I could change my actions,
if I could murder Rahm Tak

18:48.047 --> 18:50.782
and raise the Arch, I would do so.

18:50.783 --> 18:52.717
If killing myself and your mother

18:52.718 --> 18:56.688
would bring back Christie,
I would cut both our throats.

18:56.689 --> 18:59.057
But my time is done here.

18:59.058 --> 19:01.960
I'm out of choices.

19:01.961 --> 19:05.497
So I must ask

19:05.498 --> 19:07.665
_

19:08.801 --> 19:10.902
You know, it's not really the best time.

19:10.903 --> 19:14.372
Please, hear me out.

19:14.373 --> 19:16.875
I want you to go to Amanda.

19:16.876 --> 19:20.612
Tell her that I cannot
face human justice.

19:20.613 --> 19:23.915
I want to die properly.

19:23.916 --> 19:26.576
At the hands of our own people.

19:28.988 --> 19:31.456
On a shaming rack.

19:35.427 --> 19:38.196
Just so that I'm clear,

19:38.197 --> 19:40.398
rather than a quick death by hanging,

19:40.399 --> 19:45.403
you're asking to be tortured
to death by weights

19:45.404 --> 19:48.039
slowly pulling your arms
and legs from their sockets.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.509
This is what you're asking?

19:51.510 --> 19:55.580
It's the only way to remove the
stain from my immortal soul.

19:58.617 --> 20:00.752
Alak.

20:00.753 --> 20:02.854
I'll see what I can do.

20:04.023 --> 20:07.592
[door opens and closes]

20:07.593 --> 20:09.294
No, no way, Nolan. I won't do it.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.895
You think I want to be
asking you to do this?

20:10.896 --> 20:12.197
I know you don't want to fight.

20:12.198 --> 20:15.033
Then stop trying to make me.

20:15.034 --> 20:17.268
You don't join the militia,
I can't defend the town.

20:17.269 --> 20:19.091
They're going to comin here,
they're going to drag

20:19.092 --> 20:21.105
every human being they can
find into Darby Square,

20:21.106 --> 20:23.708
line them up, and shoot them
in the head ten at a time.

20:23.709 --> 20:26.077
This is how we stop them.

20:26.078 --> 20:28.479
Why? Huh?

20:28.480 --> 20:31.449
Why does everyone hurt each other?

20:31.450 --> 20:34.085
Why is our world like this?

20:34.086 --> 20:36.087
I don't know, kid.

20:36.088 --> 20:38.790
This is how it is.

20:38.791 --> 20:40.558
You ever get scared?

20:42.161 --> 20:44.629
All the time.

20:46.265 --> 20:47.832
Are you scared now?

20:49.602 --> 20:52.136
Yeah.

20:52.137 --> 20:54.005
And tired.

20:54.006 --> 20:55.106
[chuckles]

21:01.547 --> 21:03.414
I love you.

21:12.858 --> 21:15.293
- [snarls]
- [gasps]

21:17.396 --> 21:20.998
You're dirty. You need to be cleaned.

21:22.334 --> 21:24.869
Actually, I bathed fairly recent...

21:24.870 --> 21:26.650
- I insist.
- [screams]

21:29.975 --> 21:32.610
You're very pretty.

21:32.611 --> 21:34.646
Soft.

21:34.647 --> 21:37.148
[sniffs]

21:37.149 --> 21:41.219
You smell nice. I see why
my father enjoys you.

21:42.354 --> 21:44.689
You flatter me.

21:44.690 --> 21:48.960
Omec beauty is the standard by
which the rest of us are judged.

21:48.961 --> 21:53.231
For my people, a Castithan
slave was a mark of status.

21:53.232 --> 21:55.700
The finest sparked bitter competitions

21:55.701 --> 21:59.370
to see who could spoil
them with expensive gifts

21:59.371 --> 22:01.873
and fine perfumes.

22:01.874 --> 22:04.676
But when the enchanted
Castithan was used up,

22:04.677 --> 22:07.578
they'd be put down in the pens...

22:07.579 --> 22:10.348
force-fed, oiled

22:10.349 --> 22:13.651
until it was fit to be consumed.

22:13.652 --> 22:18.323
You know, my father tires of his
concubines faster than most.

22:18.324 --> 22:20.992
I've been told that when
he's done with one,

22:20.993 --> 22:25.163
he'd give it to his
children as a living toy.

22:25.164 --> 22:28.933
It is a great honor to
devour your father's whore.

22:31.904 --> 22:36.040
You know, I think I'm clean now.

22:36.041 --> 22:39.143
[breathing heavily]

22:41.280 --> 22:43.940
You're more trouble than you're worth.

22:45.551 --> 22:47.585
[panting]

22:47.586 --> 22:49.253
[gasps]

22:51.590 --> 22:55.293
Please. I will leave here.

23:00.366 --> 23:03.026
Just tell me what you want.

23:05.270 --> 23:06.404
[snarls]

23:06.405 --> 23:07.939
[gasps]

23:07.940 --> 23:10.608
I want you

23:10.609 --> 23:12.543
to die

23:12.544 --> 23:15.113
frightened.

23:15.114 --> 23:16.848
[whimpers]

23:18.851 --> 23:20.351
[both growling]

23:20.352 --> 23:23.388
[chokes]

23:23.389 --> 23:27.358
I carefully consider the
commands I give you, Kindzi.

23:27.359 --> 23:31.162
I expect you to obey them precisely.

23:31.163 --> 23:32.663
Now in a moment, I'm going to relieve

23:32.664 --> 23:35.266
the pressure from your throat,

23:35.267 --> 23:38.769
and you will apologize to Stahma.

23:40.305 --> 23:41.906
[gasping]

23:45.144 --> 23:48.079
I apologize...

23:48.080 --> 23:50.248
Stahma.

23:52.651 --> 23:55.052
Think nothing of it.

24:01.444 --> 24:04.012
[TV chatter]

24:04.013 --> 24:07.182
Conrad?

24:07.183 --> 24:09.718
[film reel clicking]

24:11.354 --> 24:14.356
What you've done to it.

24:14.357 --> 24:16.692
<i>All That Heaven Allows.</i>

24:16.693 --> 24:20.629
I remembered how much
you loved Douglas Sirk.

24:20.630 --> 24:23.165
I don't know what to say.

24:23.166 --> 24:25.867
Well, how about saying,

24:25.868 --> 24:28.303
"Wow, Conrad, that was
incredibly thoughtful,

24:28.304 --> 24:32.507
and I wish our time
together would never end"?

24:32.508 --> 24:34.876
All good things must.

24:36.713 --> 24:38.680
They don't have to.

24:38.681 --> 24:41.650
Not this time.

24:41.651 --> 24:44.152
Jess, I'm leaving tomorrow.

24:44.153 --> 24:46.154
It's a big truck.

24:46.155 --> 24:50.892
Plenty of room for an extra passenger.

24:50.893 --> 24:54.362
What, are you just going to
take me away from all of this?

24:55.932 --> 24:57.666
You know, when I agreed to come here,

24:57.667 --> 25:00.335
I didn't know what to expect.

25:00.336 --> 25:02.404
Packed up the film,

25:02.405 --> 25:04.339
the guns,

25:04.340 --> 25:06.708
hoped for the best.

25:06.709 --> 25:08.210
And?

25:08.211 --> 25:11.379
The best was here.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.184
I can't go away with you.

25:16.185 --> 25:17.185
[sighs]

25:17.186 --> 25:18.253
Defiance is my home,

25:18.254 --> 25:20.789
and I need to be here to defend it.

25:20.790 --> 25:25.227
Defiance isn't your home.

25:25.228 --> 25:28.497
You were deployed here
by the Earth Republic.

25:29.399 --> 25:30.866
Well, guess what.

25:30.867 --> 25:34.035
E-Rep is dead.

25:34.036 --> 25:37.939
Your boyfriend Tommy is dead.

25:37.940 --> 25:40.275
I'm alive,

25:40.276 --> 25:42.978
and I'm here.

25:42.979 --> 25:46.181
And I want a future with the
girl I never stopped loving.

25:51.521 --> 25:53.121
Let's just watch the movie.

25:53.122 --> 25:55.991
(Cary on TV) I just hadn't
thought about marriage.

25:55.992 --> 25:58.226
(Ron on TV) Why do you think
I've been seeing you?

26:05.268 --> 26:09.271
Alak tells me you've asked
to die on the shaming rack.

26:10.573 --> 26:13.375
What's your angle?

26:13.376 --> 26:15.677
I have quite possibly
delivered this town

26:15.678 --> 26:18.580
into the hands of a madman.

26:18.581 --> 26:20.182
I've destroyed my family.

26:20.183 --> 26:23.919
I've put the lives of
everyone I love at risk.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.688
For a Castithan, atonement
can only be achieved

26:26.689 --> 26:28.990
by what you humans would call

26:28.991 --> 26:31.860
"rough justice."

26:31.861 --> 26:36.364
I could explain this in greater
detail, but what's the point?

26:36.365 --> 26:39.100
My reasons don't matter.

26:39.101 --> 26:41.503
I suggest you ask yourself
if you'd prefer my death

26:41.504 --> 26:46.074
be quick and clean

26:46.075 --> 26:50.312
or a slow, agonizing public spectacle?

26:50.313 --> 26:52.314
Hmm.

26:56.419 --> 26:58.520
Your request is granted.

27:06.062 --> 27:07.128
Hey.

27:07.129 --> 27:09.297
What's up?
