WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.184
Who might this be?

00:03.511 --> 00:04.386
Looks familiar.

00:04.496 --> 00:05.851
He and his friend
raped a young girl.

00:05.957 --> 00:07.989
Sliced her open, took her apart.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.520
Dr. Charles "The Butcher"
Walker of Wichita.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.774
Wanted dead or alive for the maniacal evisceration
of three unmarried daughters from the Great Plains.

00:15.965 --> 00:20.280
He was captured and lynched by an angry mob
in 1902- pretty good match, right?

00:20.466 --> 00:25.555
1934: Dr. Eric Lorenz murdered a 16-year-old patient
who was complaining of swollen tonsils.

00:25.656 --> 00:26.851
He said he heard voices.

00:26.952 --> 00:30.979
1950, Dr. Kevin Diebold raped and murdered
a 12-year-old patient

00:31.082 --> 00:33.161
while her mother and two brothers
sat in the waiting room.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.814
- He said he heard a voice.
- Interesting.

00:34.913 --> 00:41.849
In 1960, Dr. Peter... Shonry raped and murdered
a 13-year-old in a public health clinic in Detroit.

00:41.943 --> 00:44.023
There's another one in 1977.

00:44.124 --> 00:46.003
You killed her in '91.

00:46.667 --> 00:51.399
Seems like every 15 years or so,
someone hears a voice and a young girl dies.

00:53.987 --> 00:54.751
Ladies.

00:55.196 --> 00:57.153
If you'll kindly take a seat
in the waiting room,

00:57.254 --> 01:00.233
the doctor and I will finish up
and be with you shortly.

01:04.976 --> 01:06.681
There you go, Mrs. Jorgensen.

01:07.479 --> 01:09.825
I trimmed the fat off
just the way you like.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.463
Thank you, dear.

01:11.564 --> 01:12.776
See you next week.

01:12.885 --> 01:13.487
Okay.

01:13.892 --> 01:15.951
Number 74.

01:17.557 --> 01:18.850
Here.

01:19.623 --> 01:21.476
What can I do you for, sir?

01:21.960 --> 01:23.031
What's fresh today?

01:23.792 --> 01:25.668
The veal cutlets are awfully nice.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.584
Actually, I was looking for
something a little more exotic.

01:28.926 --> 01:31.625
Hmm. Something exotic...

01:34.378 --> 01:35.872
How about these?

01:36.354 --> 01:37.511
They're perfect for frying.

01:38.114 --> 01:38.911
Nice.

01:39.188 --> 01:41.129
How much would you
recommend per person?

01:41.390 --> 01:43.487
As an appetizer, I mean.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.582
A quarter pound each should do it.

01:45.018 --> 01:46.151
Make it half a pound.

01:46.546 --> 01:47.819
I'm entertaining a lady friend.

01:50.990 --> 01:52.657
Something in mind
for a main course?

01:53.666 --> 01:56.099
I'm not sure yet,
but I want it to be special.

01:57.241 --> 01:59.571
We might have
just the thing for you, sir.

02:03.595 --> 02:04.749
Oh, yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.092 --> 02:14.238
That's perfect.

02:15.555 --> 02:17.042
My gal's gonna love that.

02:19.234 --> 02:20.785
Isn't that right, love?

02:21.384 --> 02:23.899
Isn't that right... Allison?

02:32.907 --> 02:34.113
You doing okay?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.584
I just nodded off for a second.

02:39.167 --> 02:40.932
It was him again.

02:42.042 --> 02:44.842
He's back. I know it.

02:46.283 --> 02:50.262
Allison, I need you to focus
on what's happening right here, right now.

02:51.650 --> 02:52.674
You're right.

02:53.745 --> 02:56.008
Did the district attorney's office call?

02:56.109 --> 02:57.884
Did Devalos call?

02:57.985 --> 03:02.105
Yeah. He said he felt terrible about it.

03:02.263 --> 03:05.646
He said he... he wished
you could understand.

03:05.747 --> 03:07.995
But he said there's
nothing he can really do.

03:08.096 --> 03:09.410
At least not tonight.

03:11.021 --> 03:12.062
Of course.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.632
Right. Uh...

03:16.710 --> 03:20.876
Well, in that case, I think
we should get this over with.

03:30.565 --> 03:33.078
Pursuant to the penal code
of the state of Arizona...

03:37.755 --> 03:41.409
...you're under arrest for assault
with intent to cause bodily injury.

04:37.420 --> 04:40.052
If it were any other day,
we could get you arraigned and out of here.

04:40.175 --> 04:44.257
Well, next time I decide to assault somebody,
I'll make sure it's not on a Sunday.

04:47.192 --> 04:50.124
Look,
I'll stall as long as I can, but...

04:50.225 --> 04:54.025
sooner or later, they're gonna want to take you downstairs
and put you in a holding cell for the night.

04:54.236 --> 04:55.452
Have you heard from my husband?

04:55.553 --> 04:59.406
Yeah. The officer who dropped your daughter off
said he was trying to get someone to watch the girls.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.478
He should be coming
through the door any minute.

05:04.103 --> 05:05.318
Hey, I need your help.

05:05.499 --> 05:07.723
I need you to listen
to this young woman.

05:07.824 --> 05:10.515
I need you to do what she says,
go to bed when she tells you to.

05:10.616 --> 05:11.342
But...

05:11.494 --> 05:14.002
And most of all, I need you
to not fight with your sister.

05:14.103 --> 05:14.703
But...

05:16.121 --> 05:16.898
Ah-ah.

05:17.634 --> 05:18.234
Okay?

05:18.647 --> 05:19.749
Now listen.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.683
If I'm still not here
by the time you wake up,

05:22.784 --> 05:25.811
then I need you to do
whatever Kim tells you to.

05:25.912 --> 05:32.057
Go to school and know that by the time you come home,
Mommy or me or both of us will be here.

05:32.711 --> 05:33.311
Okay?

05:33.949 --> 05:37.102
But I don't want Mommy
to be in jail.

05:37.515 --> 05:38.932
Mrs. Dubois is in jail?

05:39.619 --> 05:40.641
What did she do?

05:41.660 --> 05:43.993
Nothing. It's just,
it's all a misunderstanding.

05:45.417 --> 05:48.043
Ah...  okay, so you got
my cell phone number.

05:48.144 --> 05:49.942
With any luck, I'll be home
in a couple hours.

05:58.182 --> 05:59.072
Morning, Mommy.

05:59.173 --> 06:00.295
Morning, Daddy.

06:01.416 --> 06:02.879
What's all this?

06:02.985 --> 06:04.138
I made coffee.

06:04.248 --> 06:07.720
Two percent and sugar for you...
and black for you.

06:08.986 --> 06:10.632
I find this
very frightening.

06:11.685 --> 06:12.512
Enjoy!

06:17.220 --> 06:18.526
Would you look at that.

06:19.706 --> 06:21.880
The troops are
feeding themselves.

06:22.436 --> 06:25.478
I made our lunches, too,
and checked Bridgette's homework for her.

06:25.579 --> 06:27.656
Mm! Wow! Thank you.

06:28.873 --> 06:30.382
Do you want a waffle?

06:31.008 --> 06:32.460
Okay, what's going on?

06:32.745 --> 06:35.554
It's not my birthday,
it's not Father's Day...

06:35.665 --> 06:37.231
She's buttering you up.

06:37.354 --> 06:38.366
Am not.

06:38.608 --> 06:40.318
That's okay, I like butter.

06:40.419 --> 06:43.902
Butter away. Unless you're looking for
another advance on your allowance.

06:44.003 --> 06:44.861
It's not that.

06:46.266 --> 06:49.524
Can I go to the movies this Saturday
with some friends from school?

06:49.625 --> 06:51.081
Uh, depends.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.626
Depends on what?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.659
On the movie; the friends.

06:55.931 --> 06:58.280
Well, I don't know
what movie yet.

06:59.087 --> 07:00.384
Do you know
what friends yet?

07:01.090 --> 07:03.446
Her boyfriend, Todd Gromada.

07:03.592 --> 07:05.085
He's not my boyfriend.

07:05.699 --> 07:08.382
But he did ask me to go
with him and his friends.

07:08.885 --> 07:10.006
Girls, too.

07:10.444 --> 07:13.869
Honey... we talked about this.

07:14.439 --> 07:18.275
If  there are no parents there,
then your mom and I need to know who the kids are.

07:18.453 --> 07:20.083
I'm trying to tell you who they are.

07:20.734 --> 07:25.669
And that means that one or both of us
need to actually have met them.

07:25.874 --> 07:28.565
Which means actually laid eyes on them,

07:28.666 --> 07:30.519
talked to their parents,
that kind of thing.

07:30.620 --> 07:32.275
But he's really nice, Dad.

07:32.376 --> 07:33.580
You'll like him.

07:33.681 --> 07:37.099
His mom died when he was little,
and his dad's a doctor.

07:37.473 --> 07:40.248
I'm sure he is very nice, sweetie,
but that's not the point.

07:40.548 --> 07:41.924
Yeah, and he's 14.

07:45.268 --> 07:46.555
Fourteen?

07:47.547 --> 07:49.553
I guess.
He's in the eighth grade.

07:49.996 --> 07:50.938
Eighth grade?

07:51.483 --> 07:52.184
No.

07:52.853 --> 07:56.330
No way are you going to the movies
with a 14-year-old and a bunch of his friends.

07:56.431 --> 07:57.856
But, Dad, he asked me.

07:58.013 --> 07:59.804
No. Uh-uh.
It's not gonna happen.

07:59.905 --> 08:00.887
But, Dad...

08:01.816 --> 08:03.761
I expect you to back me up on this.

08:03.862 --> 08:06.856
14? Absolutely. God!

08:07.202 --> 08:09.757
She's gonna come to you next,
so we need to be on the same page.

08:10.788 --> 08:13.027
How old were you when your parents
started letting you do stuff like...

08:13.128 --> 08:14.628
meet boys at the mall?

08:14.902 --> 08:17.491
I don't know.
About Ariel's age.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.974
Wrong answer.

08:20.463 --> 08:21.139
Oh, my gosh.

08:21.308 --> 08:24.117
If Todd Gromada had asked me to go
to the movies and my parents said no,

08:24.218 --> 08:26.435
- ... I don't know what I would do.
I know.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.803
Have you told Todd you can't go yet?

08:28.904 --> 08:30.101
No. It's so embarrassing.

08:30.202 --> 08:31.982
He's never gonna talk to me again.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.356
Um, excuse me, sir.

09:11.457 --> 09:13.337
Is this where the history books are?

09:13.530 --> 09:14.359
Some of them.

09:15.001 --> 09:16.643
What time period would you be interested in?

09:17.436 --> 09:20.467
I'm doing a report
on women in the pioneer days.

09:21.253 --> 09:23.464
Women in the pioneer days!

09:24.465 --> 09:29.665
Well... lucky for you, that is
a particular interest of mine.

09:34.079 --> 09:35.581
She'll be arraigned first thing tomorrow.

09:35.682 --> 09:37.716
Soon as you post bail,
you can take her home.

09:37.817 --> 09:39.126
Okay, that's a relief.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.713
Is there any way that
I can see her tonight?

09:41.814 --> 09:44.032
Absolutely.
She's right in here.

09:45.208 --> 09:46.086
How are the girls?

09:46.187 --> 09:46.918
They miss you.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.192
They want you home.

09:48.293 --> 09:49.286
Even Ariel?

09:49.387 --> 09:50.125
Of course.

09:51.153 --> 09:53.692
I still can't understand
why she took off like that.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.471
I've never been so scared.

09:55.572 --> 09:57.815
I was sure something horrible
had happened to her.

09:57.916 --> 09:58.965
I know, I know, I know.

09:59.146 --> 09:59.885
It's okay.

10:00.966 --> 10:02.957
You just overreacted, that's all.

10:03.684 --> 10:05.505
Sorry to interrupt.

10:06.785 --> 10:08.068
It's time to go downstairs.

10:09.337 --> 10:11.714
What... Hold on a second.
Just wait a second.

10:11.815 --> 10:13.436
I mean, there's got to be
some way around this.

10:13.945 --> 10:15.339
I mean, you know her.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.589
After all that she's done
for you people.

10:16.690 --> 10:17.487
You know her.

10:17.588 --> 10:18.755
I wish there were.

10:19.782 --> 10:20.890
Maybe in the morning.

10:20.991 --> 10:21.784
In the morning?

10:22.525 --> 10:23.809
Okay, look, it's fine.

10:23.910 --> 10:25.497
It's gonna be 12 or 14 hours.

10:25.598 --> 10:26.718
I'll be fine.

10:27.832 --> 10:29.245
Well, I'm gonna wait right here.

10:29.346 --> 10:30.549
That would be silly.

10:30.650 --> 10:32.854
Joe, go home, be with the girls.

10:34.524 --> 10:35.533
I love you.

10:39.942 --> 10:41.369
I love you.

10:53.799 --> 10:54.831
Hey, Ariel.

10:55.968 --> 10:57.489
Hi, Todd.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.233
So, what's up?

11:02.420 --> 11:03.361
N othing.

11:04.258 --> 11:04.858
Shh!

11:09.484 --> 11:10.630
So you coming Saturday?

11:12.898 --> 11:15.092
Um... I can't.

11:15.551 --> 11:16.476
How come?

11:16.577 --> 11:17.644
I- I just can't.

11:19.882 --> 11:20.614
On Sunday...

11:21.910 --> 11:24.363
...my dad said I could have
some people over to swim and stuff.

11:24.871 --> 11:26.448
Maybe  you could drop by, or whatever.

11:26.864 --> 11:28.486
Maybe, yeah.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.305
Look, if you don't want to come...

11:31.442 --> 11:32.751
I do, I...

11:33.716 --> 11:35.021
I just...

11:35.352 --> 11:36.884
Have to ask your mommy.

11:36.985 --> 11:38.139
Shut up, dude.

11:38.312 --> 11:39.837
Look at her, she's like 12.

11:46.586 --> 11:47.824
Come on, Todd, let's go.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.079
See you around.

12:04.643 --> 12:05.704
Oh my God...

12:06.905 --> 12:08.705
How tragic.

12:09.606 --> 12:10.206
Sorry, I know it's none of my business,
but I couldn't help overhearing.

12:05.805 --> 12:07.805
Tell your parents whatever they need to hear;
find a way to get there yourself.

12:14.870 --> 12:16.411
He's sweet on you, you know.

12:17.295 --> 12:19.621
He is- a fellow can tell.

12:20.726 --> 12:21.840
It doesn't matter.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.036
I can't see him outside of school.

12:24.346 --> 12:26.549
My parents won't let me go anywhere,

12:26.650 --> 12:27.250
do anything.

12:26.611 --> 12:30.020
Yeah, parents are funny like that.

12:30.684 --> 12:31.870
Especially nowadays.

12:31.971 --> 12:33.792
It's like they don't want
their children to grow up.

12:34.302 --> 12:35.784
Didn't used to be like that.

12:36.885 --> 12:38.153
Like in the pioneer days...

12:39.020 --> 12:42.637
...a girl your age would be
practically old enough to get married.

12:44.265 --> 12:47.107
You know that Juliet was only 13.

12:47.621 --> 12:49.295
Really? 13?

12:54.581 --> 12:59.082
The word "teenager" didn't even exist
until 50 or 60 years ago.

12:59.204 --> 13:03.794
It was only invented to help parents prolong
childhood for as long as possible.

13:05.514 --> 13:06.613
My point is...

13:06.714 --> 13:11.914
you know that you're mature and responsible,
even if your parents haven't caught on yet.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.251
They don't need to know
all your business.

13:16.798 --> 13:21.757
There's no harm keeping things from them
that they'd rather not hear, like, say...

13:21.858 --> 13:24.889
where you're really going when
there's a boy you want to see.

13:25.203 --> 13:27.169
But I can't lie.

13:27.538 --> 13:30.087
So do you want to go to
this boy's on Sunday or what?

13:36.545 --> 13:38.443
It's a little cold in here, Doctor.

13:45.384 --> 13:46.023
Come on now.

13:46.124 --> 13:47.429
Have you seen her?

13:47.630 --> 13:48.601
Have you looked at her?

13:48.702 --> 13:51.591
This is the greatest moment of your life.

13:52.129 --> 13:54.097
Is this going to hurt, Doctor?

14:04.103 --> 14:05.671
She wants some doctoring, my friend.

14:06.330 --> 14:08.482
She needs some doctoring.

14:09.081 --> 14:11.297
Don't keep the young woman waiting,
she's cold.

14:12.003 --> 14:13.538
They're lovely when they're cold.

14:14.245 --> 14:18.351
Little river of blood making its way
across her flushed skin.

14:19.678 --> 14:22.977
Really... this is going to be
the greatest moment of your life.

14:31.110 --> 14:32.669
A nice clean cut, mate.

14:41.631 --> 14:46.830
Remember... this is
the greatest moment of your life.

15:01.327 --> 15:02.523
Hey, honey, hold still...

15:02.624 --> 15:04.682
But I can't see the TV.

15:05.657 --> 15:06.876
Who designs these things?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.247
What is a Puca,

15:10.348 --> 15:12.848
and why does it have a shell?

15:14.827 --> 15:16.235
Okay, there we go.

15:16.371 --> 15:16.971
All  right.

15:17.028 --> 15:19.110
Yeah, that looks nice.

15:21.319 --> 15:22.526
Anything?

15:23.209 --> 15:24.986
Mm... no, doesn't seem to be.

15:25.167 --> 15:26.662
So maybe it was just a dream.

15:27.625 --> 15:28.602
Maybe.

15:31.710 --> 15:32.479
Hi, Mom.

15:32.781 --> 15:34.002
Hi, Dad.

15:34.103 --> 15:36.815
Am I imagining things,
or is our daughter speaking to us again?

15:37.196 --> 15:39.223
I'm not mad anymore.
It's no big deal.

15:39.324 --> 15:41.525
I'd rather hang out
with my friends, anyway.

15:41.626 --> 15:42.854
Really?

15:43.340 --> 15:47.275
Hannah invited Celeste and me over
to her house on Sunday afternoon.

15:47.611 --> 15:48.893
Sounds like fun.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.465
Do you need anyone
to drop you off or anything?

15:52.085 --> 15:55.949
I think Hannah's mom said that
she would pick us up- but I'll check.

15:59.150 --> 16:00.094
"Table".

16:00.195 --> 16:05.488
T- A-B... L-E.

16:05.934 --> 16:09.111
Excellent spelling,
middle child.

16:13.963 --> 16:17.937
Hey, look.
That's Ariel's boyfriend behind us.

16:18.423 --> 16:20.022
He's not my boyfriend.

16:21.459 --> 16:24.410
His license plate
almost spells "doctor. "

16:24.636 --> 16:27.272
I wonder if he knows
that he spelled it wrong.

16:27.373 --> 16:29.019
It's on purpose, doofus.

16:29.469 --> 16:30.734
Todd's dad is a doctor.

16:30.979 --> 16:33.418
Well, then how come
he doesn't know how to spell it?

16:35.291 --> 16:36.546
Forget it.

16:36.727 --> 16:37.429
Okay, okay.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.035
Good-bye, my beautiful girls.

16:39.167 --> 16:40.624
Okay.

16:41.062 --> 16:42.543
Bye!

16:42.644 --> 16:43.736
Bye, kittens.

16:43.837 --> 16:44.815
Bye bye.

17:45.137 --> 17:47.934
You want to be careful not to put
anything other than paper down the toilet.

17:48.035 --> 17:51.746
They back up all the time, and there'll be nobody here
to fix it until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

17:56.744 --> 17:58.689
He was just sitting
right there in the car.

17:59.234 --> 18:00.629
Well, now you're contradicting yourself.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.356
I'm not contradicting myself.

18:02.526 --> 18:05.298
He was right there,
then he was gone.

18:05.399 --> 18:07.339
But he was definitely there.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.674
Okay. Fine, he was there.

18:08.775 --> 18:09.754
So what do you want to do?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.734
Well, jeepers, Pa,
what do you want to do?

18:11.967 --> 18:13.902
Hey, I'm just trying to be practical.

18:14.003 --> 18:15.509
It seems to me we've already done it.

18:15.610 --> 18:17.442
We've forbidden Ariel
from seeing this boy,

18:17.543 --> 18:19.943
so presumably she's not going to have
any contact with his father, right?

18:20.168 --> 18:25.889
And if your thesis here is that this guy's Walker's next cipher,
that this guy's somehow in the market for some young girl to cut up...

18:25.990 --> 18:28.757
then the key is to make sure
Ariel has no contact with him.

18:28.989 --> 18:31.661
What about all the other girls
he does have contact with?

18:31.762 --> 18:36.044
Do we just sit around and let this guy
set a trap for someone else's daughter?

18:36.145 --> 18:37.033
Huh?

18:37.134 --> 18:38.648
And what about Dr. Gromada?

18:38.749 --> 18:42.177
Are we just going to let him
be tortured, day in and day out,

18:42.278 --> 18:44.812
hearing some voice in his head
urging him to kill?

18:44.913 --> 18:46.943
What am I supposed to do, Joe?

18:47.375 --> 18:49.434
Just sit around
and wait for it to happen?

18:49.574 --> 18:50.522
Allison...

18:50.623 --> 18:53.588
I don't understand how
can you dismiss this so easily.

18:53.953 --> 18:55.437
Hey, I'm not dismissing anything.

18:55.538 --> 18:57.903
But don't you find it
monumentally coincidental

18:58.004 --> 19:00.104
that of all the doctors in the world,
the one that Walker chooses

19:00.205 --> 19:03.505
happens to be the father of a boy
our daughter has a crush on?

19:03.782 --> 19:06.873
'Cause I do- I find that
monumentally coincidental.

19:07.197 --> 19:09.527
So I'm asking you to consider
the slim possibility-

19:09.654 --> 19:11.096
before we turn our neighbors in to the police

19:11.197 --> 19:14.097
based on theories that are difficult,
if not impossible to prove;

19:14.200 --> 19:16.763
before we embarrass our daughter
in front of her friends,

19:16.864 --> 19:20.470
before we label respected members
of the community as future child murderers-

19:20.571 --> 19:24.124
that perhaps you've taken a dream you had
about a case from a year ago

19:24.225 --> 19:25.425
and mixed it up with the anxiety you're having

19:25.526 --> 19:31.426
about your oldest daughter wanting to begin dating boys,
and projected that onto the boy's father.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.072
Hi, Todd.

19:36.652 --> 19:37.724
Hey, Ariel.

19:38.251 --> 19:40.888
So are you still having people over on Sunday?

19:41.385 --> 19:44.158
'Cause... maybe if you were, I'd come.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.378
Yeah, it's still on; come.

19:46.563 --> 19:47.525
Cool.

19:48.289 --> 19:50.471
So,  where do you live?

19:50.813 --> 19:51.923
Out by Lakewood.

19:52.062 --> 19:54.343
It's the big pinkish house on Hyacinth.

19:55.219 --> 19:56.945
Yeah, okay. I'll find it.

19:57.441 --> 19:58.412
Cool.

19:59.126 --> 20:00.189
See you there, okay?

20:00.438 --> 20:01.038
See you.

20:05.075 --> 20:06.203
Did he say Lakewood?

20:06.304 --> 20:08.669
That's, like, all the way across town
from where you live.

20:08.912 --> 20:10.228
How are you even
going to get there?

20:10.674 --> 20:11.383
I don't know.

20:12.482 --> 20:14.024
I haven't figured that out yet.

21:06.264 --> 21:07.498
You having a problem?

21:08.904 --> 21:11.903
Uh... no, my car just conked out
while I was waiting.

21:12.996 --> 21:15.966
Well, I can take a look,
if you want.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.541
Not that I'm an expert or anything.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.756
Oh, that would be great.

21:20.524 --> 21:21.962
I can use any help I can get.

21:22.584 --> 21:24.722
I'm Allison; I'm Ariel Dubois' mom.

21:24.823 --> 21:26.309
Jim- I'm Todd Gromada's dad.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.563
Well, I appreciate it, Jim.

21:30.246 --> 21:34.573
It's funny, this little voice in my head this morning
told me I should take this car in to get serviced.

21:34.864 --> 21:35.878
Oh, yeah?

21:37.703 --> 21:41.345
You know that little voice
in your head sometimes people talk about?

21:41.982 --> 21:46.929
Your battery contacts are pretty dirty,
but that shouldn't cause it to just stop.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.656
You don't think I'm crazy, do you,
talking about a little voice?

21:52.411 --> 21:53.333
Excuse me?

21:53.768 --> 21:56.337
You just said something;
I wasn't really listening.

21:57.016 --> 21:57.901
That's okay.

21:58.485 --> 22:01.322
Sometimes it's hard to hear what people say
when you have a voice in your head

22:01.423 --> 22:03.223
trying to talk to you, too.

22:04.498 --> 22:07.795
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

22:10.470 --> 22:13.797
Nothing. I'm just... rambling.

22:22.305 --> 22:23.732
Excuse me, do you know Ariel?

22:25.308 --> 22:27.781
Do-Do any of you know
Ariel- Ariel Dubois?

22:27.882 --> 22:28.497
Is she here?

22:28.598 --> 22:30.684
I don't know. Out back
by the pool or something.

22:36.964 --> 22:37.564
Ariel?

22:50.661 --> 22:51.327
Ariel!

22:58.549 --> 23:00.022
Mrs. Dubois?

23:01.527 --> 23:02.817
Mrs. Dubois?

23:04.115 --> 23:05.089
Here's your problem.

23:05.190 --> 23:06.435
Your coil cable was loose.

23:10.805 --> 23:11.656
Voilà!

23:12.187 --> 23:12.909
Hey, Mom.

23:15.028 --> 23:15.910
Hi, Mom.

23:16.914 --> 23:18.332
Um, can I put this in the car?

23:18.485 --> 23:20.988
I'm walking home with Hannah,
and I don't want to have to carry it.

23:21.089 --> 23:21.846
Are you Ariel?

23:22.304 --> 23:23.856
I'm Dr. Gromada, Todd's dad.

23:24.343 --> 23:25.603
Get in the car.

23:26.342 --> 23:27.725
Mom, this is my friend Todd's dad.

23:27.826 --> 23:28.610
Is everything all right?

23:28.711 --> 23:30.017
Get in the car.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.553
Mom, I'm walking home.

23:31.742 --> 23:32.796
Not today.

23:34.537 --> 23:37.459
Thank you for your help.
I think I have everything under control now.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.420
Are you sure?

23:39.679 --> 23:40.791
I- I feel like...

23:42.088 --> 23:43.658
Have I done something to upset you?

23:44.245 --> 23:45.039
Hey, Air.

23:46.519 --> 23:47.281
Hey, Dad.

23:49.456 --> 23:50.485
What's going on?

23:52.186 --> 23:53.189
I have no idea.

24:17.263 --> 24:19.438
Sounds like she made
quite a scene, your mum.

24:20.066 --> 24:21.192
I hate her.

24:21.712 --> 24:23.786
And my dad's pretty mad at her, too.

24:24.452 --> 24:25.847
Have you seen Todd
since it happened?

24:26.142 --> 24:29.779
Once, in the hallway,
but he pretended not to see me.

24:30.778 --> 24:32.901
Well, you can explain when
you see him on Sunday.

24:33.002 --> 24:34.748
I'm not going to see him on Sunday.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.842
I can't go,
not after what happened.

24:36.989 --> 24:37.992
You have to go.

24:38.154 --> 24:39.770
Especially after what happened.

24:41.549 --> 24:42.590
I thought you liked him.

24:43.914 --> 24:45.047
I know he likes you.

24:54.411 --> 24:55.080
Listen to me.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.506
You can't leave it like this.
You'll never forgive yourself.

24:58.641 --> 24:59.554
You don't understand.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.772
Even if I wanted to go,
I have no way of getting there.

25:02.933 --> 25:04.205
Ride your bike.

25:04.652 --> 25:05.514
Too far.

25:06.009 --> 25:06.935
What about the bus?

25:07.036 --> 25:08.142
By myself?

25:08.981 --> 25:11.261
Do you have any girlfriends
that live close to Todd?

25:11.705 --> 25:12.376
I don't know.

25:13.373 --> 25:14.795
Maybe Celeste.

25:15.304 --> 25:16.792
But what good does that do?

25:28.741 --> 25:30.135
What's up? Where are you going?

25:30.373 --> 25:32.790
Don't get up.
It's Sunday. It's fine.

25:33.791 --> 25:36.660
Um, Ariel wants me
to run her over to Celeste's.

25:36.978 --> 25:37.720
Okay.

25:38.307 --> 25:40.397
Well, she gonna come in
and say good-bye?

25:41.627 --> 25:43.929
It's okay.
She's already in the car.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.126
Just let it go, huh?

25:48.762 --> 25:49.701
She'll get over it.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.435
Just give her some time, yeah?

26:10.468 --> 26:12.038
The girls and I are going to the car wash.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.539
It's going to be very exciting.

26:13.799 --> 26:14.899
You sure you don't want to join us?

26:15.000 --> 26:15.672
Nah.

26:16.262 --> 26:18.580
It's a tough ticket,
but I know people.

26:18.729 --> 26:20.003
I think I can get you in.

26:20.382 --> 26:21.639
Think I'll pass.

26:21.771 --> 26:25.396
I don't think my fragile
constitution could handle it.

26:26.239 --> 26:28.171
Oh, what time is Ariel due back?

26:28.437 --> 26:30.064
I told her I'd pick her up at 4:00.

26:30.861 --> 26:34.488
All right, well, if you're in a jam,
let me know- I can pick her up.

26:34.589 --> 26:37.617
Al, it's 2:00. I'm going to the carwash.
I should be back in 45 minutes.

26:38.792 --> 26:40.262
- Okay.
- All right.

27:09.184 --> 27:10.225
I'm coming, I'm coming.

27:11.355 --> 27:12.209
Hello.

27:12.646 --> 27:14.258
Is Ariel Dubois at home?

27:16.441 --> 27:18.040
May I ask who's calling?

27:18.965 --> 27:19.932
A friend.

27:22.529 --> 27:23.543
No. I'm sorry.

27:23.644 --> 27:25.110
She's not home right now.

27:25.231 --> 27:26.086
I see.

27:26.872 --> 27:28.111
Do you happen to know where she is?

27:30.300 --> 27:33.018
No. I'm sorry, I don't.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.370
Oh. I do.

27:56.773 --> 28:00.071
Hi. Hello? Hi. This is Allison Dubois.
I'm Ariel's mother.

28:00.630 --> 28:03.092
Hi, Celeste. Listen,
I need to speak with Ariel.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.569
What do you mean she's not there?

28:09.424 --> 28:11.778
We have, uh, diet stuff.

28:12.056 --> 28:15.384
Juice, milk, whatever you want.

28:16.056 --> 28:17.004
I don't know.

28:17.107 --> 28:18.173
Water, I guess.

28:26.908 --> 28:28.678
So, I didn't think you were
really gonna come.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.800
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
about that thing with my mom.

28:33.122 --> 28:36.186
She can kind of be out there sometimes.

28:38.912 --> 28:41.363
I better get that, but
don't go anywhere, okay?

28:43.707 --> 28:44.460
Okay.

28:48.297 --> 28:48.897
Ariel...

28:50.606 --> 28:53.475
Oh... hi.
What-What are you doing here?

28:53.598 --> 28:54.486
Never mind that.

28:55.378 --> 28:56.207
We've got a problem.

28:56.308 --> 28:57.341
Your mother's on her way.

28:57.527 --> 28:58.641
What? My mom?

29:00.341 --> 29:01.032
This way.

29:05.210 --> 29:05.868
Come on!

29:13.043 --> 29:13.883
Dad!

29:15.310 --> 29:16.173
Dad!

29:34.649 --> 29:35.747
Where's Ariel?

29:37.577 --> 29:39.662
Where... Where is Ariel?

29:39.763 --> 29:41.351
Uh, out back by the pool...

29:42.995 --> 29:43.733
Ariel!

29:58.380 --> 29:59.282
Ariel!

30:02.165 --> 30:02.921
Ariel!

30:06.622 --> 30:07.422
Ariel!

30:11.016 --> 30:11.742
Mom!

30:12.286 --> 30:14.018
Mom, Mom,
stop it!

30:14.331 --> 30:16.374
Mom, stop it!

30:26.914 --> 30:29.607
Isn't God the most
inspired architect?

30:33.020 --> 30:33.765
Look at that.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.608
She knows it, too.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.793
She knows she's a work
of divine genius.

30:39.746 --> 30:44.247
What she doesn't understand is
just how short-lived her divinity is.

30:46.251 --> 30:48.628
14, 15, 16...

30:48.729 --> 30:52.529
those years- they're like
the first days of spring.

30:56.430 --> 30:57.031
Look at her.

30:58.349 --> 31:00.508
She's in her early May, I'd say.

31:07.461 --> 31:08.644
That's the ticket.

31:09.543 --> 31:11.994
Now invite her to join you in the back.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.690
Perhaps she wants
to play doctor.

31:15.100 --> 31:17.091
Attention shoppers,
it's ten minutes to 11:00,

31:17.192 --> 31:20.692
and that means the Sunfair Market
will be closing in ten minutes.

31:23.088 --> 31:24.265
Comes the dawn.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.724
Finally figured it out, eh?

31:36.479 --> 31:37.328
Yeah.

31:39.249 --> 31:40.276
Yes.

31:42.996 --> 31:44.287
It's the butcher.

31:45.134 --> 31:46.596
Let you in on a secret.

31:47.575 --> 31:51.662
I'm not at all sure how I feel
about this 21st century.

31:52.748 --> 31:54.682
The girls I want to ravage,

31:54.783 --> 31:57.940
seems they only want to go
to female physicians.

31:58.041 --> 32:02.400
No matter how long or loud I
whisper to a female physician-

32:03.300 --> 32:05.500
well, suffice it to say

32:05.600 --> 32:08.900
listening is not something
they seem much interested in.

32:09.878 --> 32:11.851
Maybe it's what you're whispering.

32:12.852 --> 32:13.552
Maybe.

32:13.921 --> 32:15.658
No accounting for taste.

32:16.608 --> 32:22.536
Nonetheless... clearly,
it's incumbent upon me to adapt or die.

32:24.596 --> 32:26.868
Well, not die.

32:28.462 --> 32:33.101
Anyway, I've been whispering
in my butcher friend's ear for months.

32:34.171 --> 32:35.586
When I first found him,

32:36.187 --> 32:38.187
I thought I could talk him into
going to medical school,

32:38.288 --> 32:41.988
but he really doesn't have the book smarts
to become a physician.

32:42.567 --> 32:46.916
Just sensitive and suggestible
in the ways that matter most.

32:48.181 --> 32:49.902
And he's good with his hands.

32:51.187 --> 32:53.883
Skilled with a blade.

32:55.030 --> 32:56.767
The truly important things.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.973
It was never gonna be
Todd's father, was it?

33:01.413 --> 33:03.221
I sensed you were onto me-

33:04.122 --> 33:09.022
you and your dreams of butchers
and fresh, frozen females.

33:10.051 --> 33:12.167
Had to do something
to throw you off the scent.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.511
And what a brilliant stroke of luck.

33:17.127 --> 33:22.502
Your little girl's sweetheart
has a father who is a doctor.

33:23.206 --> 33:24.652
I hate you!

33:25.824 --> 33:27.031
I appreciate that.

33:29.767 --> 33:31.009
It's a little after 9:00.

33:31.189 --> 33:32.370
I really should be running.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.687
And you should wake up now.

33:44.385 --> 33:45.386
Guard!

33:46.399 --> 33:47.588
Someone!

33:48.100 --> 33:50.399
I need to call
Detective Lee Scanlon!

33:52.279 --> 33:53.567
Please!

33:54.726 --> 33:55.940
There's my dad.

33:56.229 --> 33:58.456
Thanks a lot for coming
at the last minute like that.

33:58.557 --> 34:01.410
And you tell your dad that
I appreciate him picking you up.

34:01.639 --> 34:02.409
All right?

34:02.510 --> 34:04.086
I hope everything works out.

34:04.298 --> 34:05.568
Me, too.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.449
What are you doing up?

34:21.797 --> 34:23.581
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

34:25.359 --> 34:30.563
I didn't mean to make trouble,
but I didn't think anything bad was gonna happen.

34:30.846 --> 34:32.081
I know, sweetheart.

34:32.641 --> 34:35.051
But sneaking off without telling us,

34:35.252 --> 34:37.552
tricking Mommy and Daddy like that...

34:38.166 --> 34:39.994
It wasn't my idea, you know.

34:41.036 --> 34:43.717
It doesn't matter. What difference
does it make which of your friends thought it?

34:43.819 --> 34:44.918
The point is...

34:45.018 --> 34:47.078
It wasn't one of my friends.

34:47.406 --> 34:49.275
It was the new librarian.

34:50.650 --> 34:51.918
Wait a second. What?

34:52.444 --> 34:55.129
At school, the new librarian.

34:58.103 --> 35:05.449
Ariel, an adult, a member of the school faculty
told you to lie and sneak off to a party?

35:07.593 --> 35:10.205
Does this librarian have a name?

35:10.633 --> 35:13.338
I don't know, actually.
He didn't say.

35:13.439 --> 35:15.166
But he had an English accent.

35:15.978 --> 35:17.216
English accent?

35:17.981 --> 35:18.637
Okay.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.381
And... and you know what was weird?

35:21.614 --> 35:23.486
He was at the party, too.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.712
He was at the party?

35:27.602 --> 35:31.391
And he told me to hide,
'cause Mom was looking for me.

35:32.509 --> 35:33.833
Ariel, wait a second.

35:34.106 --> 35:36.511
How does this guy even know
what Mommy looks like?

35:37.046 --> 35:37.936
I don't know.

35:39.909 --> 35:42.539
But he's the reason
that I walked into the door.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.589
I was following him,
and it was so weird.

35:46.690 --> 35:48.815
He must've closed it behind him.

35:49.251 --> 35:53.545
But he couldn't have,
because I was right behind him.

35:53.929 --> 35:55.197
Ariel, hold on.

35:56.408 --> 35:57.420
I don't understand, sweetie.

35:57.521 --> 35:58.894
Explain that to me again.

36:00.666 --> 36:03.110
It was like he walked
through the glass or something.

36:03.211 --> 36:05.050
Like a ghost out of a movie.

36:09.933 --> 36:10.781
Scanlon here.

36:11.251 --> 36:12.423
Detective, hi.

36:12.524 --> 36:14.517
Uh... I'm glad I caught you.

36:14.618 --> 36:16.647
This is Joe Dubois,
Allison's husband.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.147
Hi. What can I do for you?

36:18.248 --> 36:22.224
I know this is gonna sound kind of nutty,
but is there any way that I could talk to my wife?

36:23.108 --> 36:25.211
I'm running out of time!

36:27.145 --> 36:28.541
Not much of a signal down here.

36:30.370 --> 36:31.077
It's your husband.

36:32.031 --> 36:35.679
You know, you have
one very excitable family.

36:39.074 --> 36:40.984
It's a little cold in here, Doctor.

36:46.537 --> 36:51.582
I got to tell you, this is about the strangest place
I've ever done anything like this.

36:55.383 --> 36:57.603
You sure you don't
want to go to a bar first?

36:59.513 --> 37:02.643
A little alcohol wouldn't hurt anything,
if you know what I mean.

37:05.707 --> 37:08.906
I mean, I don't need a white
tile room to play doctor.

37:09.176 --> 37:10.936
I can do just fine in the dark.

37:11.940 --> 37:12.700
Come on now.

37:13.134 --> 37:14.015
Have you seen her?

37:14.612 --> 37:15.793
Have you looked at her?

37:15.925 --> 37:17.901
This is the greatest moment of your life.

37:19.817 --> 37:21.208
Is this gonna hurt, Doctor?

37:31.424 --> 37:32.967
She wants some doctoring,
my friend.

37:33.556 --> 37:36.074
She needs some doctoring.

37:36.357 --> 37:37.847
Don't keep the young woman waiting.

37:37.948 --> 37:40.585
She's cold.
They're lovely when they're cold.

37:41.574 --> 37:45.693
Little river of blood, making its way
across their flushed skin.

37:47.185 --> 37:50.126
Really, this is going to be the
greatest moment of your life.

37:59.500 --> 38:00.793
A nice clean cut, mate.

38:09.604 --> 38:14.452
Remember, this is the
greatest moment of your life.

38:17.637 --> 38:19.205
Phoenix Police!
Drop the knife!

38:19.510 --> 38:21.951
Sir, you get any closer to the girl
with that knife, and I will fire.

38:22.101 --> 38:25.090
And trust me, my bullet will travel
a lot faster than your arm.

38:25.199 --> 38:26.024
Do it!

38:26.125 --> 38:27.412
Sir, lower the knife.

38:29.364 --> 38:30.841
Tear her! Do it!

38:30.942 --> 38:32.142
Lower the knife.

38:33.304 --> 38:33.904
Don't listen to him!

38:33.867 --> 38:36.024
Sir, I'm gonna count to three.

38:36.385 --> 38:37.590
If you don't drop the weapon...

38:37.932 --> 38:38.712
Put it in her!

38:39.578 --> 38:41.876
One, two...

38:42.003 --> 38:43.024
Pierce her, damn it!

38:43.125 --> 38:44.619
Rip her apart!

38:51.781 --> 38:53.048
Go ahead, put on your clothes.

38:55.521 --> 38:57.627
I need an ambulance at Sunfair Market.

38:57.896 --> 38:59.134
Are you happy?

38:59.405 --> 39:00.328
You ruined it.

39:00.429 --> 39:01.899
Sir, you're under arrest.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.198
You ruined everything.

39:03.299 --> 39:03.899
Turn around.

39:03.790 --> 39:04.478
Wonderful.

39:04.579 --> 39:07.491
- A butcher with a bad arm.
- You have the right to remain silent.

39:07.886 --> 39:10.321
- A hysterical, fully dressed girl.
- Anything you say, can and will...

39:10.558 --> 39:11.654
You have the right to counsel.

39:11.755 --> 39:13.620
Stop crying!
Nothing happened!

39:13.721 --> 39:16.162
If you are unable to obtain counsel,
counsel will be appointed for you.

39:16.263 --> 39:17.827
If you choose to answer questions
without an attorney present...

39:17.928 --> 39:19.133
You people. Pathetic.

39:22.421 --> 39:23.668
Mrs. Allison Dubois?

39:32.407 --> 39:33.680
Here, Your Honor.

39:34.065 --> 39:35.847
Do you understand the charges
against you, Mrs. Dubois?

39:35.948 --> 39:37.049
I do, Your Honor.

39:37.358 --> 39:39.137
State have a bail recommendation?

39:39.498 --> 39:41.207
Begging the court's indulgence,
Your Honor.

39:41.308 --> 39:43.218
But I just came from
a conference with the complainant.

39:51.752 --> 39:53.551
Your Honor, I'm happy to report
that once Dr. Gromada

39:53.652 --> 39:57.752
was made aware that this was nothing more
than a case of mistaken identity on Mrs. Dubois' part,

39:57.853 --> 40:01.258
made in her capacity
as an employee of my office,

40:01.359 --> 40:04.339
and that a young woman's life was saved
as a result of her efforts,

40:04.440 --> 40:06.782
the good doctor has agreed
to drop all charges.

40:06.883 --> 40:07.596
Very well.

40:07.735 --> 40:11.274
If that's the situation,
I'm not one to make more work for this court.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.723
Case dismissed.

40:14.987 --> 40:16.340
You're free to go,
Mrs. Dubois.

40:17.632 --> 40:18.394
Thank you.

40:23.946 --> 40:25.300
- No TV for a month.
- Okay.

40:25.401 --> 40:27.414
- No phone privileges.
- All right.

40:27.625 --> 40:31.135
- And no time on the computer unless it's specifically homework related.
- But...

40:31.236 --> 40:32.100
Okay.

40:33.474 --> 40:34.707
I'm sorry, Mom.

40:34.808 --> 40:35.966
I know you are.

40:38.865 --> 40:41.502
Is anything gonna happen
to the man in the library?

40:41.728 --> 40:43.095
He isn't there anymore.

40:43.397 --> 40:46.507
And if you ever see him again,
if he ever tries to talk to you,

40:46.608 --> 40:49.808
you ignore him and you tell me
right away, okay?

40:50.056 --> 40:50.827
Okay.

40:52.534 --> 40:58.252
And, Ariel, I want you to know
that I am going to call Todd's dad tomorrow,

40:58.353 --> 41:00.605
and I'm gonna personally apologize.

41:01.885 --> 41:07.906
It's okay; he was talking
to this seventh-grade girl today- Julie.

41:09.982 --> 41:11.199
Oh, wow.

41:11.810 --> 41:15.442
It sounds like I roughed up
the wrong Gromada in that house.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.809
I love you, Mom.

41:22.899 --> 41:24.114
I love you, Ariel.

41:30.841 --> 41:32.661
Now let's get some sleep.

41:33.003 --> 41:33.784
Okay.

41:48.485 --> 41:53.485
