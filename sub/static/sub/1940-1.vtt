04:23.931 --> 04:25.973
My name is Alice.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.184
I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation,

04:28.352 --> 04:32.104
the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.733
I was head of security at a secret
high-tech facility called the Hive,

04:36.193 --> 04:41.447
a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental, viral weaponry.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.741
There was an incident.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.535
A virus escaped.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.664
A lot of people died.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.419
The trouble was,
they didn't stay dead.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.800
The computer that controlled the Hive
was a state-of-the-art

05:00.968 --> 05:03.344
artificial intelligence:
The Red Queen.

05:06.139 --> 05:10.393
The Red Queen responded to the threat
of the viral outbreak in an extreme way.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.269
She went homicidal.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.023
- You're all going to die down here.
- The Red Queen attempted

05:16.191 --> 05:17.441
to kill everyone, Down!

05:17.609 --> 05:19.151
Whether they were infected or not.

05:22.114 --> 05:26.450
I managed to escape,
but this was only the beginning.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.207
Viral outbreaks spread like wildfire,

05:33.709 --> 05:37.420
first across the United States,
then the world.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.758
The T-Virus didn't just
bring the dead back to life.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.845
It mutated them in terrifying ways.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.765
Despite the apocalypse
they had created,

05:49.933 --> 05:54.103
the Umbrella Corporation continued
to experiment with the deadly virus.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.647
I was infected.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.984
But the virus bonded with me
on a cellular level.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.528
I developed powers.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.573
Your genetic structure is the key.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.408
L became different.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.703
Powerful.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.705
Unstoppable.

06:14.332 --> 06:18.002
As I got stronger,
the human race became weaker.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.173
I tried my best to lead
what survivors I could find to safety,

06:22.340 --> 06:24.675
but we were pursued relentlessly.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.054
Even my friend Jill Valentine was
seized and brainwashed by Umbrella.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.638
Shoot to kill.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.933
Finally, I confronted the
head of the Umbrella Corporation,

06:33.101 --> 06:35.186
Albert Wesker.

06:35.353 --> 06:39.607
He robbed me of my powers,
but I still managed to defeat him.

06:39.775 --> 06:43.527
At last, we thought it was over.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.405
We thought we had survived
the horror.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.744
But we were wrong.

06:51.912 --> 06:56.248
Once again,
we found ourselves fighting

06:56.416 --> 06:57.917
for our lives.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.510
Go, go, go!

08:01.148 --> 08:02.690
Rise and shine.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.318
Come on, babe. We're late.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.404
The alarm didn't go off.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.656
Becky's not up yet.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.367
Miss Henderson's
gonna be pissed.

08:13.535 --> 08:17.121
You know how they get
when you drop her off late at the school.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.589
Babe? You all right, babe?

08:28.550 --> 08:29.258
Yeah.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.179
I'll go get Becky.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.267
I charged your batteries
for you.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.024
Becky, you know Miss Henderson,

08:45.775 --> 08:48.652
she wants you to speak
while you sign.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.613
Thank you, Daddy.

08:51.823 --> 08:55.784
When you come back from school,
I have a surprise for you.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.107
L heard that.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.707
These batteries
are lasting less and less.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.209
We need to get some new ones.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.585
I can pick some up

09:04.753 --> 09:06.921
on my way home.
I'm gonna be late again.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.466
Aw, shit.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.092
I'll get you another shirt

09:12.260 --> 09:13.594
from the bedroom.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.930
Someone picked up
your dry-cleaning yesterday.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.350
You are my little angel, aren't you?

09:19.684 --> 09:21.143
You're gonna be late, remember?

09:21.645 --> 09:22.603
Yeah.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.356
Ooh.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.024
Heh. I'll get you that shirt.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.236
Get Becky back! Aah!

09:33.281 --> 09:34.573
No!

09:38.203 --> 09:39.245
No!

09:44.793 --> 09:47.044
Help! Help us!

09:58.515 --> 09:59.598
Come on. Come on!

10:00.892 --> 10:01.600
Come on.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.579
Go.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.766
Go!

11:25.643 --> 11:26.310
No!

11:40.200 --> 11:41.992
Back! Wait!

11:42.160 --> 11:43.035
Wait! Stay back!

11:46.581 --> 11:47.790
What is wrong with you?

11:49.876 --> 11:50.876
Come on, get in.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.727
What's going on?

12:08.895 --> 12:10.104
Your guess is as good as mine.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.313
Why are these people

12:11.481 --> 12:14.191
doing this?
Those things are not people. Not any...

12:38.049 --> 12:39.675
Are you hurt?

12:42.804 --> 12:45.222
Can you move? Okay.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.359
Come on.

13:05.869 --> 13:06.910
Shit!

13:14.627 --> 13:16.253
Mommy.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.421
Mommy, come on.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.755
Go!

14:02.258 --> 14:04.510
I love you.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.572
Project Alice,

15:48.865 --> 15:51.450
why did you turn against Umbrella?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.160
Jill?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.245
Ls that you?

15:55.413 --> 15:57.039
Project Alice,

15:57.540 --> 16:00.417
why did you turn against Umbrella?

16:00.585 --> 16:03.045
What happened to Chris and Claire?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.921
Where are the others from the ship?

16:22.357 --> 16:24.191
Project Alice,

16:24.859 --> 16:27.444
who do you work for?

16:29.197 --> 16:30.530
Project Alice,

16:33.034 --> 16:34.660
who do you work for?

16:36.579 --> 16:39.706
Jill, why are you doing this?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.483
Warning. Warning.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.403
Unauthorized computer access.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.905

17:25.670 --> 17:26.837
50 seconds.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.341

17:31.509 --> 17:35.554

17:58.369 --> 18:02.622

18:03.499 --> 18:06.001
Central computer rebooting.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.431
Scramble all security teams.

18:19.807 --> 18:20.474
And sweep

18:20.641 --> 18:22.517
the corridor with the laser grid.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.640
Stand by.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.811
Stand by.

19:50.106 --> 19:53.066
Tokyo sequence initialized.

24:47.862 --> 24:49.154
Stand by.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.949
Stand by.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.959
Welcome to Umbrella Central Control.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.568
Yeah.

25:52.927 --> 25:54.010
Don't.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.970
My name is... Ada Wong.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.849
Operative for the Umbrella Corporation,
one of Albert Wesker's top agents.

26:00.017 --> 26:03.770
I know exactly who and what you are.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.813
Now, the real question is:

26:05.981 --> 26:08.274
Why don't I just cancel
your contract right now?

26:08.734 --> 26:11.236
I don't work for Umbrella anymore,

26:11.862 --> 26:14.197
and neither does Albert Wesker.

26:14.365 --> 26:15.615
I don't care.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.533
You can kill her if you like,

26:17.701 --> 26:20.119
but then you'll never get out
of this place.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.330
Wesker. Now, be a good girl.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.623
Put down the knife.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.210
And Alice,

26:27.378 --> 26:29.504
how nice to see you again.

26:30.381 --> 26:31.756
How did she get out?

26:31.924 --> 26:33.716
She's obviously getting help.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.469
We have a traitor in this facility.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.805
Security systems were shut
down for two minutes.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.140
- What about Control?
- We still

26:41.308 --> 26:42.517
can't raise them.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.688
I executed everyone

26:46.855 --> 26:48.815
in this control room.

26:48.983 --> 26:51.150
I enabled Wesker
to hack the mainframe.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.153
We shut down the security systems.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.905
We let you out of that cell.

26:56.073 --> 26:59.075
We have to get you out of this facility.

26:59.243 --> 27:02.328
So why do you want to help me?
We need you.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.914
The human race faces extinction.

27:05.082 --> 27:08.626
Our only hope of survival
is for us to work together.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.003
I'm not going anywhere

27:10.170 --> 27:13.923
until I know where we are
and what the hell is going on here.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.509
You're in the Prime Umbrella
testing facility.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.469
Explain Tokyo.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.097
What you saw was just
a detailed re-creation,

27:21.265 --> 27:22.932
nothing more.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.393
It goes on for a few city blocks.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.395
That's all.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.063
I was outside.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.106
Were you?

27:30.733 --> 27:32.400
Saw the sky, did you?

27:32.568 --> 27:35.820
It was night. Stars? The moon?

27:35.988 --> 27:41.200
The testing floor is 300 feet high,
the ceiling black.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.119
It's usually night in there.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.538
But isn't that when
the monsters come out anyway?

27:46.290 --> 27:48.499
It was raining.
Climate control.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.668
Wind, rain.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.962
They can even make it snow
if they want to.

27:53.464 --> 27:55.548
Why build such a place? Simple.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.760
The Umbrella Corporation
derived its primary income

27:58.927 --> 28:00.928
from the sale of viral weaponry,

28:01.096 --> 28:03.514
something that's impossible
to test in the real

28:03.682 --> 28:05.767
world. They re-created the center

28:05.934 --> 28:07.060
of New York,

28:07.227 --> 28:10.146
simulated an outbreak,
showed it to the Russians,

28:10.314 --> 28:12.440
and sold them the virus.

28:12.608 --> 28:16.611
They simulated an outbreak in Moscow,
sold it to the Americans.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.112
An outbreak in Tokyo.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.989
Sold it to the Chinese.

28:20.157 --> 28:23.076
An outbreak in China.
Sold it to the Japanese.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.704
Exactly. Everyone had to have it.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.791
The Umbrella Corporation
built a new arms race.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.417
Only, this time,

28:31.585 --> 28:34.629
it was biological rather than nuclear.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.005
Highly profitable.

28:36.757 --> 28:39.008
And this is where it all happened.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.094
This is Umbrella's greatest creation.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.680
The belly of the beast.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.308
So why don't we
just get the hell out of here?

28:48.268 --> 28:49.310
Stop.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.022
Sunup is in less than a minute.

28:53.899 --> 28:54.732
Why don't you

28:54.900 --> 28:56.859
just see for yourself?

28:57.027 --> 28:59.821
This facility is located
in the straits of Kamchatka,

29:00.781 --> 29:03.866
northern Russia.
The old Soviet Union

29:04.034 --> 29:06.494
built submarine pens here
in the '80s.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.496
After the Cold War ended,

29:09.415 --> 29:11.958
the Umbrella Corporation
expanded them,

29:12.126 --> 29:14.669
and built the testing floor.

29:17.965 --> 29:21.551
No one has ever escaped
from this facility.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.720
Ice.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.056
You'll need all the help you can get,

29:27.224 --> 29:31.102
so I've arranged for a strike team to
enter from the surface and assist you.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.523
There they are.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.276
Intake vents for the Umbrella facility.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.113
Looks abandoned.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.157
That's what they want you to think.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.410
Let's move. We have just two hours

30:29.578 --> 30:30.912
to extract Alice and Ada.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.290
After that, we can expect
heavy Umbrella reinforcements.

30:46.887 --> 30:47.678
Running a bypass.

30:52.434 --> 30:53.142
These are

30:53.310 --> 30:54.352
the codes from Ada.

30:54.895 --> 30:55.728
Do you trust her?

30:55.896 --> 30:57.355
Just enter the numbers.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.737
The charges are set.

31:08.075 --> 31:08.991
We're in.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.218
Let's go do this.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.845
They're in.

31:30.013 --> 31:33.599
The strike team has secured an elevator
for your escape to the surface.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.726
They will eliminate
Umbrella resistance,

31:35.894 --> 31:37.395
then rendezvous with us,

31:37.563 --> 31:38.771
and escort us out.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.189
They have a friend

31:40.357 --> 31:41.524
of yours with them.

31:41.692 --> 31:43.192
Luther West.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.860
He's alive?

31:45.279 --> 31:47.530
All right. Hold on, ladies.

31:55.289 --> 31:58.958
- Synchronize watches.
- Two hours exactly in

31:59.126 --> 32:01.836
three, two, one, mark.

32:08.468 --> 32:09.635
Leon,

32:09.803 --> 32:10.595
why don't we

32:10.762 --> 32:11.679
trigger remotely?

32:12.180 --> 32:14.098
Can't risk them jamming the signal.

32:14.641 --> 32:18.853
And whether we succeed or not,
this facility has to be destroyed.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.189
What if we take
longer than two hours?

32:22.357 --> 32:24.984
Then I hope you're really good
at holding your breath.

32:26.737 --> 32:30.740
Security Chief Valentine has reached
the Tokyo test environment.

32:30.907 --> 32:31.741
She's tracking

32:31.908 --> 32:32.783
you.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.577
They're headed this way.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.121
Her orders are to recapture you,

32:37.289 --> 32:38.414
if possible,

32:38.582 --> 32:41.250
terminate you if necessary.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.210
Who's giving these orders?

32:43.378 --> 32:44.503
The Red Queen.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.547
The computer? Yes.

32:46.715 --> 32:50.217
The same artificial intelligence
you encountered in the Hive.

32:50.385 --> 32:53.721
She now controls what remains
of the Umbrella Corporation.

32:53.889 --> 32:57.183
She will stop at nothing
to prevent you escaping to the surface.

32:57.934 --> 32:58.726
I've plotted

32:58.894 --> 33:00.186
an escape route for you.

33:00.354 --> 33:03.105
You'll cross the New York
environment to Suburbia

33:03.273 --> 33:05.483
where you'll rendezvous
with the strike team.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.527
They'll escort you
through the Moscow environment,

33:08.695 --> 33:10.696
to the submarine pens.

33:10.864 --> 33:13.199
And take the elevator
back to the surface.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.993
The Red Queen
has intercepted my signal.

33:16.161 --> 33:19.080
She's about to regain control
of this facility.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.581
You must hurry. I can't...

33:22.959 --> 33:24.794
Don't listen to the traitor Wesker.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.088
I am in control now.

33:28.382 --> 33:29.382
Project Alice, Ada Wong,

33:29.549 --> 33:30.966
stay where you are.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.927
- Let's move.
- Project Alice,

33:35.097 --> 33:37.223
you're all going to die down here.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.059
I've heard that before.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.666
Defensive formation.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.835
Mark your targets.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.545
Fire at will.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.063
Submarine pens are up ahead.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.360
Barry, you and I take point.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.864
We rendezvous with Alice and Ada
in 30 minutes.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.382
Clear.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.184
Now, that's some hardware.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.226
Typhoon class.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.772
The biggest nuclear subs
the Soviets ever built.

35:07.939 --> 35:12.109
Umbrella used them to secretly transport
bioweapons all over the globe.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.070
- Let's pick up the pace.
- We have less than 90 minutes.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.031
Intruders detected.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.450
Targeted for termination.

35:23.497 --> 35:25.122
New York.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.249
We need to cross two more

35:27.417 --> 35:29.043
test environments to escape.

35:29.211 --> 35:29.919
Let's move.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.254
Why would Umbrella
continue to run these tests?

35:32.422 --> 35:35.883
They want to study the biohazard,
learn how to control it.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.803
Initialize New York sequence.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.347
Activate biohazard.

35:44.100 --> 35:47.978
Stand by. Stand by.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.232
New York sequence initialized.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.233
The Red Queen.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.609
She's activating

35:53.777 --> 35:55.820
bioweapons to stop us.
Let's go.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.822
Wait.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.156
You hear that?

36:08.625 --> 36:09.625
You know what it is?

36:10.335 --> 36:11.877
I have an idea.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.314
You have got to be kidding me.

38:05.951 --> 38:06.742
Hey, boys.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.371
Bad idea.

38:30.558 --> 38:31.517
Let's move.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.311
We're behind schedule.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.826
What's going on?

38:48.994 --> 38:51.203
It's the end of the sequence.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.497
They rarely last
more than an hour.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.957
Come on.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.877
Before the Red Queen
activates something else.

38:59.879 --> 39:02.089
Targets survived.

39:02.257 --> 39:05.134
Security Chief Valentine
to intercept.

39:05.719 --> 39:08.762
Intruders entering
Moscow test environment.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.682
Activate Las Plagas Undead.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.444
What's going on?

39:23.611 --> 39:27.114
- The Red Queen knows we're here.
- Keep your eyes open.

39:27.282 --> 39:30.868
Stand by. Stand by.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.203
Moscow sequence initialized.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.085
What? Listen.

39:46.217 --> 39:46.884
Right there.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.020
What the hell are those things?

40:03.276 --> 40:04.568
Fall back.

40:04.736 --> 40:05.486
Fall back.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.843
Clouds.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.179
They're not real.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.640
It's a holographic projection.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.643
When they were running
a simulation,

40:37.811 --> 40:41.146
trust me,
no one was looking at the sky.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.404
This is the rendezvous point.

40:50.323 --> 40:51.740
The strike team is late.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.367
Where are they?

40:55.286 --> 40:57.871
There's movement
in the house behind you.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.915
Upstairs window.

41:24.232 --> 41:26.108
Why would they be in here?

41:33.950 --> 41:35.951
They're using clones of me.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.703
Of course.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.830
You were one of the 50 basic models.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.334
"Basic models."

41:44.502 --> 41:48.172
How do you think Umbrella
populates these test scenarios?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.340
Hundreds of people dead each time

41:50.508 --> 41:51.717
they run a simulation.

41:51.885 --> 41:54.970
Umbrella imprints them
with basic memories,

41:55.138 --> 41:58.140
just enough to ensure
a correct emotional response

41:58.308 --> 42:00.142
to the threat of the biohazard.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.019
In one life, she could be

42:02.187 --> 42:03.395
a suburban housewife.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.939
The next, a businesswoman
in New York.

42:06.107 --> 42:09.484
The next,
a soldier working for Umbrella.

43:29.482 --> 43:30.148
Mommy.

43:31.150 --> 43:31.817
I hid

43:31.985 --> 43:33.277
like you told me.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.116
What happened to your clothes

43:39.284 --> 43:40.659
and your hair?

44:25.747 --> 44:27.080
RPG! Down!

44:32.003 --> 44:33.420
We're running out of time!

44:34.005 --> 44:36.048
You have to find us
a way out now!

44:36.841 --> 44:38.258
Almost there!

44:56.986 --> 44:58.487
None of this is real.

44:58.988 --> 45:00.822
It is to her. I know.

45:00.990 --> 45:02.115
That's the point.

45:02.283 --> 45:06.119
All these feelings she has for you,
they were imprinted.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.663
A day ago,

45:08.831 --> 45:10.624
she was a blank slate.

45:10.792 --> 45:14.086
I could show you a dozen
just like her in cold storage.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.048
I'm sorry, but it's true.

45:18.508 --> 45:19.508
Ready.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.760
I was fast, wasn't I?

45:22.428 --> 45:23.929
Yes, you were.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.876
Daddy? He's not your father.

45:55.044 --> 45:56.628
Capture if possible.

45:56.796 --> 45:58.755
Terminate if necessary.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.259
There's a child here.

46:02.427 --> 46:04.678
Your problem, not ours.

46:04.846 --> 46:08.014
All heart. You haven't changed a bit.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.225
I don't know you, lady.

46:10.393 --> 46:11.560
Now,

46:11.727 --> 46:14.438
surrender or die.

46:27.326 --> 46:27.993
Stay down!

47:12.955 --> 47:14.039
Advance in teams!

47:14.207 --> 47:15.373
Yes, ma'am!

47:22.381 --> 47:23.048
You can't

47:23.216 --> 47:24.174
stay here!

47:24.675 --> 47:26.551
This will show you the way out.

47:27.136 --> 47:28.553
Go through Moscow to the

47:28.721 --> 47:29.471
submarine pens.

47:30.223 --> 47:30.931
Take this.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.099
The less I have

47:33.267 --> 47:34.726
with me, the better.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.687
Alpha Team forward!

48:00.419 --> 48:01.628
They're coming. Hurry.

48:01.796 --> 48:03.046
Go.

48:53.097 --> 48:53.805
I've got it!

48:53.973 --> 48:54.723
This way!

49:02.940 --> 49:04.399
Hey.

49:05.067 --> 49:05.942
Wait.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.569
She helped us. Remember?

49:08.779 --> 49:09.946
You two made it!

49:12.742 --> 49:13.950
Thought I was the only one

49:14.118 --> 49:14.868
that survived.

49:15.036 --> 49:17.954
What is this place,
and why is everything in Russian?

49:18.122 --> 49:20.624
And what's with the S & M getup?

49:21.584 --> 49:22.250
You know how

49:22.418 --> 49:23.752
to use this?

49:23.919 --> 49:25.503
I campaigned for gun control.

49:27.673 --> 49:30.717
No, I don't think you understand.
I marched against the NRA.

49:30.885 --> 49:32.427
Concentrate.

49:33.095 --> 49:34.888
It's just like a camera.

49:35.056 --> 49:37.807
Point and shoot.

49:41.437 --> 49:44.856
Congratulations.
You're officially a badass.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.319
What the hell's going on here?

49:49.862 --> 49:51.363
I'll explain when I get back.

49:51.530 --> 49:52.864
You have to keep her safe.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.867
You stay with her.
You're going?

49:56.035 --> 49:57.702
You said you wouldn't leave.

49:57.870 --> 50:00.372
Trust me, okay? What I say is true.

50:00.539 --> 50:01.581
I'll come back for you.

50:01.749 --> 50:03.041
You promise?

50:03.209 --> 50:04.834
Trust me.

50:09.965 --> 50:11.424
I love you.

50:14.178 --> 50:14.886
Come on.

50:15.846 --> 50:17.472
She'll be back for you.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.140
Gotta find a hiding place.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.935
I met your sister. What?

50:22.103 --> 50:24.437
She's not very nice.

50:25.606 --> 50:27.357
Let's try hiding down here.

50:39.370 --> 50:40.036
This way.

50:40.329 --> 50:41.538
Let's move!

50:43.124 --> 50:44.290
We can work our way...

51:11.569 --> 51:13.194
Waiting for a written invitation?

51:23.539 --> 51:24.831
Sweet ride.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.375
Well, this is Moscow.

51:27.668 --> 51:29.669
Heard gunfire.
Thought you might need

51:29.837 --> 51:31.713
some help. Where's Ada?

51:31.881 --> 51:33.089
I don't think she made it.

51:34.717 --> 51:36.634
I'm sorry. You saw

51:36.802 --> 51:37.719
her die?

51:38.137 --> 51:38.928
No.

51:39.638 --> 51:40.305
She always

51:40.473 --> 51:41.806
has a plan.

52:20.763 --> 52:22.847
Boys, you mind?

52:23.474 --> 52:25.433
Shall we? My pleasure.

52:56.841 --> 52:58.967
Let me know when you plan
on doing that again.

53:05.099 --> 53:06.057
Heads up.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.762
Our little friend is back!

53:45.264 --> 53:46.222
Shit.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.395
- Almost there.
- No.

53:52.646 --> 53:54.314
Wait. You're not going down there!

54:36.857 --> 54:37.565
Everyone okay?

54:39.735 --> 54:40.485
Yeah.

54:40.819 --> 54:41.986
All right, let's go.

54:44.782 --> 54:45.907
Hello?

54:46.825 --> 54:48.409
You can come out.

54:49.703 --> 54:50.662
I'm back.

54:56.543 --> 54:58.044
Where'd you find these guys?

55:00.005 --> 55:01.005
Who's this?

55:01.465 --> 55:02.674
I'm Becky.

55:03.300 --> 55:04.509
Hi, Becky.

55:04.718 --> 55:06.177
This is my mom.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.721
Your mom? Mm.

55:09.556 --> 55:10.807
Long story.

55:12.643 --> 55:13.601
Twenty-two minutes left.

55:15.062 --> 55:16.771
There's no going back
the way we came.

55:16.939 --> 55:18.314
We lost our map with Sergei.

55:18.607 --> 55:19.565
I'm on it.

55:32.871 --> 55:34.288
We can take this tunnel.

55:34.456 --> 55:37.500
There's a service shaft
that leads down to the submarine pens.

55:38.127 --> 55:39.377
Let's go.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.904
How'd you end
up working for Wesker?

56:07.072 --> 56:08.656
I don't work for him,

56:08.824 --> 56:10.742
but things on the surface
have changed.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.327
Wesker said you knew
of some weapon,

56:13.495 --> 56:15.329
something that could
turn the tide

56:15.497 --> 56:16.581
for us.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.207
But I don't think

56:18.375 --> 56:20.626
I would have risked
so much for one person.

56:22.296 --> 56:23.921
You're probably right.

56:24.089 --> 56:25.381
This way.

56:26.300 --> 56:27.341
The submarine pens

56:27.509 --> 56:28.634
are up above us.

56:29.511 --> 56:30.928
Come on. Move.

56:50.449 --> 56:53.326
The elevator platforms are up ahead.

56:53.494 --> 56:54.160
Eleven minutes.

56:55.162 --> 56:57.371
We're gonna be okay. Hold on.

56:59.333 --> 57:02.126
- Eleven minutes.
- We're gonna be okay.

57:02.294 --> 57:05.129
Hold on. Accessing power grid.

57:05.297 --> 57:07.256
Dispatching biohazard.

57:12.888 --> 57:14.472
Everybody get on board.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.645
Hold on. Next stop,

57:20.813 --> 57:23.231
menswear and sporting goods.

57:30.280 --> 57:30.947
Move down!

57:32.658 --> 57:34.700
Barry, what is it?
I don't know.

57:35.494 --> 57:36.410
Where are you going?

57:36.578 --> 57:38.454
Somebody must've
cut the power remotely.

57:41.708 --> 57:43.417
Be strong.

57:43.585 --> 57:44.919
I'm gonna keep you safe.

57:55.305 --> 57:56.305
Can you get it online?

57:56.473 --> 57:57.348
Not without

57:57.516 --> 57:58.432
the access codes.

58:01.895 --> 58:04.397
Nine minutes.
Looks like we're going with plan B.

58:05.357 --> 58:06.524
What?

58:06.692 --> 58:08.860
There's a reason
we planted those explosives.

58:18.829 --> 58:19.495
No!

58:24.877 --> 58:25.543
Mommy!

58:27.588 --> 58:29.839
Aah! Mommy!

58:36.096 --> 58:37.013
I feel like shit.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.102
She's dead.

58:52.070 --> 58:54.280
What are you doing?
She's alive.

58:54.448 --> 58:55.656
I'm going to get her.

58:55.824 --> 58:57.116
I didn't lose friends

58:57.284 --> 58:58.075
so you could

58:58.243 --> 58:59.452
walk away. I plan

58:59.620 --> 59:00.536
on coming back.

59:01.747 --> 59:03.080
Don't do this.

59:03.248 --> 59:04.165
You're more important

59:04.333 --> 59:05.166
than she is.

59:05.334 --> 59:07.251
That's where you're wrong.

59:07.419 --> 59:08.836
This is a mistake.

59:09.254 --> 59:11.005
Get out of my way.

59:20.265 --> 59:22.099
Don't leave without me, okay?

59:22.267 --> 59:24.352
Are you kidding me?
I'm going with you.

59:31.902 --> 59:33.569
Don't move. Don't move.

59:33.737 --> 59:34.737
It's okay.

59:35.530 --> 59:36.364
Go get her back.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:07.061
You like that? Huh?

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:45.618
Move up!

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.461
Fall back to the elevator!

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:57.380
You go!

01:01:58.673 --> 01:01:59.924
I'm gonna stay a while.

01:02:00.092 --> 01:02:01.509
Barry.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:04.011
When the countdown
gets down to zero,

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:06.097
you have to be
on that elevator!

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:07.431
Someone's got to stay.

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:09.892
Besides,

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.314
I'm kind of enjoying myself!

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.987
Go. Go!

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:24.573
Come on!

01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:51.368
Becky. Becky.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:07.718
Go!

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:34.995
Bring out the prisoner!

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:45.548
Cease your firing.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.008
Or I'll execute her.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:50.970
Now,

01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:53.973
throw down your guns,

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.224
and step out.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:56.642
Step out,

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.394
or she dies!

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:20.225
Mommy, who are they?

01:06:25.774 --> 01:06:26.523
Who are they?

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:32.071
Mommy, is that you?

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:48.295
You're my mommy, aren't you?

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.130
I am now.

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:57.489
Move!

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:04.223
Choppers are on their way,

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.017
so just sit back and relax.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.676
What's going on?

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:53.313
What the hell is that?

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:05.534
Becky, are you hurt?

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:07.160
No. I'm okay.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.491
Told you she'd have a plan.

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.498
Only the two of you?

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:36.416
It'll be enough.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.256
The Las Plagas parasite.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:14.342
Aah!

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:42.639
Terminate Project Alice.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:14.374
Alice!

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:32.767
You can't kill me.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.519
I don't need to.

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:21.024
I'm coming for you!

01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:23.151
Good luck with that.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:50.678
Leon.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:05.360
What is it?

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.611
It's help.

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:20.935
Glad to have you back.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:56.095
I don't care.

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:27.627
Wesker.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.422
I see you've made yourself at home.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.342
Well, I must say,

01:23:35.094 --> 01:23:37.845
it does have a certain ease to it.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:56.072
What is this?
What have you done

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.281
to me?

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:00.743
You were the only one

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:03.955
to successfully bond
with the T-Virus,

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:07.166
to fully realize her powers.

01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:09.585
Well, now I have need of you.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:11.587
The old you.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.716
So I've given you back your gift.

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.467
You are

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:18.136
the weapon.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.227
I'm gonna kill you.

01:24:27.146 --> 01:24:28.354
Perhaps.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:32.108
But first, you have work to do.

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:39.407
The Red Queen is determined
to destroy all life on earth.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:43.369
This is the last that remain of us,
of the human race.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:48.207
It seems we're bonded
against a common foe.

01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:52.211
This is why we needed you back.
The ultimate weapon.

01:24:57.718 --> 01:25:00.678
This is humanity's last stand.

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:03.431
The beginning of the end.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:14.358
