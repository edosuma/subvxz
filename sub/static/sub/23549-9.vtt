WEBVTT

00:20.120 --> 00:21.880
Gods. What are they doing?

00:22.560 --> 00:25.760
Mmm, painful, isn't it?

00:28.080 --> 00:29.320
[Tripitaka] They're translating.

00:30.760 --> 00:31.760
[Davari] Yeah.

00:32.640 --> 00:37.080
Oh, so... slowly.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.560
In their minds,

00:40.640 --> 00:45.320
they are, uh, working
in the ancient library of the gods.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.960
[laughs]

00:47.800 --> 00:50.320
They think that what they're doing
will change the world.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.880
So you have the sacred scrolls?

00:51.960 --> 00:53.400
[Davari] Just the one I want.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.160
I'd begun to lose hope that these stubborn

01:01.680 --> 01:04.080
little jobsworths would ever finish.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.680
You see, a god's mind...

01:07.280 --> 01:10.200
it will always find a way to resist.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.960
But now I don't need 'em,
because I've got you.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.480
Young, energetic, malleable...

01:20.120 --> 01:22.320
human you.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.720
What will happen when it's translated?

01:25.800 --> 01:27.560
[sucks teeth and sighs]

01:28.200 --> 01:30.000
Well, that's for me to know...

01:31.640 --> 01:33.640
[softly] and you to find out.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.040
[Monkey] This place,
it used to be beautiful.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.200
Now it's full of bloodthirsty demon.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.400
[Pigsy] What does Davari
want with Tripitaka?

01:54.480 --> 01:55.480
[Monkey] Nothing good.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.480
[Raxion] Psst!

01:58.840 --> 02:00.800
-Psst!
-[Monkey] Do you hear that?

02:00.880 --> 02:02.320
Yeah, it's an old lady. Don't look at her.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.040
-She's probably a witch.
-A witch?

02:04.120 --> 02:05.520
Yeah, don't look at her.
Don't look at her.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.760
-But she wants us to follow.
-Yeah, not happening.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.919
Not following a witch down a dark alley.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.320
-Ignore her.
-Let me talk.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.920
[stammers] Monkey. Monkey! Monkey!

02:16.040 --> 02:17.040
Monkey!

02:26.760 --> 02:29.200
[Raxion softly] Davari's getting closer
to translating a scroll.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.560
[Monkey] Which scroll does he have?

02:31.640 --> 02:33.680
The scroll of how-should-I-know?

02:33.760 --> 02:35.520
But he's pretty keyed up about it,

02:35.600 --> 02:38.400
especially now that he's got
your little friend by his side.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.200
Tripitaka would never help a demon.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.880
There'll be no choice, believe me.

02:45.000 --> 02:45.840
Ha!

02:48.040 --> 02:49.520
-[Raxion stammers]
-[Monkey] What?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.040
I'm just having a moment.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.800
Here we are. [chuckles]
Gods and demons.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.640
-Worth a pause, isn't it?
-Uh...

03:02.560 --> 03:04.760
-It's... unusual.
-Yeah.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.080
[Raxion] Davari's weak spot
is that he likes to be liked.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.920
Once a week,
he goes out amongst his people.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.040
His route is preplanned,
so position yourselves where I've marked.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.440
He'll sense you if you're near him,
so keep your distance.

03:20.560 --> 03:24.080
Oh, and if you stuff this up,
I will drop you like a stone.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.200
Probably be the one
who has to execute you.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.200
-You're gonna execute me?
-Okay, we've got it.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.600
Throwing spears, arrows.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.040
Thanks for your collaboration,
but you should probably...

03:32.120 --> 03:33.960
-I mean, if I were you, I would...
-You?

03:34.040 --> 03:35.360
-You should probably...
-Execute me?

03:35.440 --> 03:36.920
-Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
-[Raxion] Mmm.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.200
-You--
-No, no, just thank you.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.560
-Beat it. Just go now.
-All right. Mmm-hmm.

03:40.680 --> 03:41.800
[Davari whistling]

03:50.960 --> 03:53.480
[chuckles] Hello.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.440
Comfortable?

03:58.360 --> 03:59.360
Sleep.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.360
Tomorrow, I'll show you around.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.920
I like to buy something normal
and meaningless,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.480
like normal, average,
meaningless people do, every day.

04:19.880 --> 04:20.880
Greetings.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.760
Oh.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.680
[softly] There's Tripitaka.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.760
Aren't you supposed to be
out on the field?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.760
-[Raxion] Mmm.
-[Davari] What do you want?

04:37.160 --> 04:40.080
To thank you for giving me
another chance...

04:40.800 --> 04:42.360
to prove myself.

04:42.440 --> 04:45.480
Don't flatter yourself.
We were short of labor.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.280
-[Pigsy] Monkey. Monkey.
-Go!

04:55.360 --> 04:57.000
-Get them!
-[guard] Yes, sir!

04:57.640 --> 05:00.440
[Davari] Not you, you chicken brains.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.240
[stutters] Now,
who do you suppose that was?

05:05.280 --> 05:06.360
I... [sighs]

05:06.440 --> 05:08.840
And how do you suppose they got in?

05:08.920 --> 05:11.920
I don't know. They... Stealthy, eh?

05:13.160 --> 05:17.560
I know your stupid plans
before you even think them up.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.320
[Davari sighs]

05:19.880 --> 05:21.200
Ciao, Raxion.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.880
No, you... Wait! Wait!

05:23.560 --> 05:25.800
You would've done the same. Hmm?

05:25.880 --> 05:28.040
You know, you never believed in me.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.800
You... you always treated me
like one of your brain-dead puppets.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.760
I worked for centuries...

05:34.760 --> 05:38.080
gave everything to forward our cause,

05:38.160 --> 05:40.640
and all I wanted was a seat at the table.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.120
Just once. And now...

05:44.680 --> 05:46.000
[chuckles]

05:47.080 --> 05:51.080
Now I will become
who I was always meant to be.

05:51.160 --> 05:55.400
Raxion will be the master
of his own destiny.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.080
Huh? Raxion will be a he--

06:09.600 --> 06:10.960
[both grunt]

06:12.120 --> 06:13.240
[guard] They went this way!

06:17.480 --> 06:19.080
[guards panting]

06:19.160 --> 06:20.200
[guard] Down here!

06:24.640 --> 06:25.800
[Pigsy panting]

06:25.880 --> 06:26.920
Come this way.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Quickly.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.280
After them!

06:38.920 --> 06:39.920
This way!

06:49.360 --> 06:52.040
Hello. Thank you for helping us.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.360
We mean you no harm.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.640
Who are you? Tell us your names.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.560
I'm sorry, my son is a little rude.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.400
Tell us your names.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.680
[clears throat] I am Monkey.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.600
And you must be
one of the less important warriors.

07:12.960 --> 07:17.040
Yes, I am Pigsy,
one of the less important warriors.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.680
My name is Shamai.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.160
This is my partner, Lusio,
my sons, Silver and Oak.

07:25.720 --> 07:29.000
For many, many generations,
we have lived in the Jade Mountain.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.000
We are the hidden Resistance.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.560
We have been waiting
for the return of the Monkey King...

07:33.640 --> 07:35.880
-to free the world of the demonic plague.
-[softly] Monkey.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.840
-Monkey. [snaps fingers]
-[Shamai] And to return truth and light.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.240
-Excellent news.
-[Silver] Tell us the plan.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.600
[Monkey] Hmm. Plan.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.280
Destroy Davari.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.360
[both spit]

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And save Tripitaka.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.320
Yes, of course, Pigsy. That was assumed.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.480
I was just going for the headline.
Destroy Davari.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.560
[both spit]

08:05.880 --> 08:07.360
The word is... [scoffs]

08:08.200 --> 08:10.040
you're not doing your work.

08:13.440 --> 08:17.440
Maybe you don't know
how to translate this text.

08:17.520 --> 08:21.480
Maybe the shaman was wrong.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.680
[grunting]

08:26.480 --> 08:29.000
Well, if that's the case, then...

08:29.680 --> 08:32.400
I guess that makes you
completely expendable.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.640
-I don't think you understand.
-[Tripitaka grunting]

08:36.720 --> 08:38.679
I'm rather in a hurry.

08:39.440 --> 08:44.880
Now, prove to me
you can translate the text,

08:44.960 --> 08:49.240
or say hello to the abyss
at the bottom of the palace.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.360
Nobody knows how deep it truly is,

08:51.440 --> 08:56.880
but those who have made the trip
have screamed for a very, very long time.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.560
[Tripitaka] I won't translate.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.920
[gasping]

09:08.760 --> 09:10.240
[Davari groans]

09:11.160 --> 09:13.120
Stop! Stop.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.400
[groans]

09:15.480 --> 09:17.080
[breathing heavily]

09:19.040 --> 09:20.520
[Davari sighs heavily]

09:21.240 --> 09:22.480
Brave.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.720
Very brave.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.720
Begin.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
You're ill.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.400
What now?

09:34.920 --> 09:37.000
That's why you're in a hurry.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.520
[laughs]

09:39.240 --> 09:40.320
Oh.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.080
Brilliant! [chuckles]

09:42.160 --> 09:45.400
Doctor, monk, boy, girl.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.040
Wrong. I am not ill.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.400
[sighs] I'm just very old, okay?

09:53.120 --> 09:57.720
I would like to live forever.
Is that so much to ask?

09:57.800 --> 09:58.640
Now...

09:59.640 --> 10:00.760
begin.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.760
-[sighs]
-So you can become immortal?

10:03.840 --> 10:05.240
[sighs]

10:06.560 --> 10:07.680
Begin.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.720
No.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.120
[Davari] Psst!

10:16.760 --> 10:17.760
[Tripitaka] No.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.800
No, wait! Please!

10:24.320 --> 10:25.680
[Davari] Poor flower.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.800
Goodbye, old friend.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.560
No!

10:46.360 --> 10:50.560
Every day you refuse to translate...

10:51.360 --> 10:54.200
one more of your precious gods will be...

10:54.920 --> 10:57.760
[pops lips] destroyed.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.600
[sniffs and chuckles]

11:00.360 --> 11:02.560
Tripitaka, the god killer.

11:04.480 --> 11:08.680
Now, that has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.360
Let's discuss a plan.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.720
With the arsenal of weapons,

11:18.800 --> 11:21.480
we can storm the palace
and smash them to pieces.

11:21.560 --> 11:25.280
That is one way, but you must remember
that we are humans, not gods,

11:25.360 --> 11:26.880
and we were expecting three gods.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.360
However, the timing of your arrival
cannot be better.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.960
-Davari...
-[spits]

11:32.040 --> 11:35.800
...is holding a banquet
for the most powerful demons in the land.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.600
We've been hired
as musicians for the event.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.040
Do either of you possess
any skills in that area?

11:41.120 --> 11:42.480
Well, I can hold a tune.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.360
Oh, you wouldn't pass
for a professional, though.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.120
Well, maybe not a solo,
but in the chorus I'd manage.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.840
-He's tone-deaf.
-[chuckles]

11:51.040 --> 11:53.120
There's something not right
about this banquet.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.480
Davari is planning something.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.280
It might be our last chance to stop him.

11:58.040 --> 12:02.240
The scholar spoke of a monk,
two warriors and the Monkey King.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.560
You said there was a third.
We must wait for him.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.760
Her. The third is a her.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.280
And has quite a nice falsetto.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.360
[bird screeching]

12:12.760 --> 12:14.760
[owl hooting]

12:22.040 --> 12:24.920
Compliments of Davari. Put it on.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
[Pigsy sighs]

12:59.000 --> 13:01.040
-Monkey, what are you doing?
-[chuckles]

13:03.640 --> 13:04.960
There's only enough for one of us.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.320
[sighs] They've been saving that
for generations.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.760
The boys told me.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.080
[sighs] I have to make sure
Tripitaka is okay.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.280
If you get caught,
the whole plan will be ruined.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.080
We can't let this family
or the Resistance down.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.560
I won't get caught.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.920
[Pigsy sighs heavily]

13:21.520 --> 13:22.760
[elixir bubbling]

13:33.720 --> 13:34.960
Monkey?

13:35.040 --> 13:36.160
[footsteps receding]

13:37.560 --> 13:38.560
[softly] Monkey?

13:38.640 --> 13:40.440
[footsteps approaching]

13:40.520 --> 13:41.680
Monkey, where are you?

13:42.360 --> 13:43.880
-[Monkey softly] I'm right here.
-[groans]

13:44.840 --> 13:47.200
Hurry up. Quit messing around.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.320
-[grunts]
-[Monkey chuckles]

13:50.400 --> 13:51.920
[clattering]

13:52.000 --> 13:53.760
[sighs] Clumsy.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.680
[door opens]

13:58.680 --> 13:59.880
Hmm.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.080
Hmm? Hmm?

14:04.160 --> 14:05.200
[Monkey] Hey, ugly.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.360
[grunts]

14:15.680 --> 14:16.680
[door creaks]

14:20.120 --> 14:21.960
[both groaning]

14:22.640 --> 14:23.640
[grunting]

14:26.040 --> 14:27.040
[groans]

14:32.760 --> 14:34.320
[lock turning]

14:44.160 --> 14:45.520
[Monkey] Hey, who are you?

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
Who's there?

14:48.160 --> 14:49.680
[Monkey] I was looking
for another prisoner.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.360
I'm sure there's only one room
in this tower.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.120
Monkey, is that you?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.320
-Where are you?
-I'm here.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.760
-How?
-I used powerful magic.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.200
But, monk, he turned you into a girl.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.880
I've always been a girl.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.760
No, no, no, no. You were a boy monk.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.160
Always a girl.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.480
I lied to you.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.000
I wanted to tell you so many times...

15:17.640 --> 15:19.400
but I thought you might feel betrayed.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.000
Hmm, betrayed? Maybe.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.920
Confused? Yes.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.600
But nothing else has changed. I--

15:25.680 --> 15:27.240
I need some time to think about this.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.680
[stammers] To get it out of my head.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.920
-Monkey, Davari has--
-[spits]

15:38.960 --> 15:40.240
I'll explain later.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.800
The sacred scroll that he has
will give him immortality.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.560
And if I don't translate it for him,

15:46.640 --> 15:49.200
he will kill one
of the captured gods every day.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.520
Members of the Resistance are helping us.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.800
They have a plan.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.400
There is only enough
for one of us to make it out.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.040
You take it.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.480
He needs me alive.
I can't leave the gods here.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.680
I left you once, and I won't do it again.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.120
Please. Take it. Go.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.360
-I'll see what I can do from the inside.
-[sighs]

16:22.680 --> 16:23.880
[sighs]

16:37.160 --> 16:38.360
Oh, can you see me?

16:43.720 --> 16:44.720
Yes.

16:48.680 --> 16:49.800
I'll take care of this.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.440
I promise.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
[guard groans]

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
[grunts]

17:25.720 --> 17:28.480
[sighs] You still smell the same.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.360
-Hey, old man.
-[Davari] Ooh.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.280
[Monkey] Look at you in the big house.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.920
Oh, now, there's no need for this.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.320
Okay, hey...

17:40.720 --> 17:41.680
[both grunting]

17:42.680 --> 17:45.320
Monkey. Monkey. Brother.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.640
I was the only one who believed in ya.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.040
[both grunting]

17:56.080 --> 17:57.040
[Davari groans]

17:57.880 --> 17:59.560
-Guards!
-[gasps]

18:01.760 --> 18:02.800
[guards grunting]

18:09.280 --> 18:12.080
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm. Fight me yourself.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.800
Why? I've worked very hard to have guards.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.000
Execute him.

18:19.480 --> 18:23.160
Oh, cloud not working anymore? [tsk-tsks]

18:24.280 --> 18:29.120
Now, you remember the, uh, Master's
bedroom was at the very top of the castle.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.080
Best view. Biggest room.

18:33.840 --> 18:37.200
Oh, but there was no hierarchy
amongst the gods, was there, Monkey?

18:37.880 --> 18:42.440
No reason you were overlooked,
treated like you were second class?

18:43.640 --> 18:46.440
[sighs] You murdered the Master.

18:47.440 --> 18:51.520
Oh. Well, you thought about it
countless times. I mean, who's worse?

18:51.600 --> 18:54.320
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard anyone say.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.560
You are.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.560
[chuckles] Oh. Yeah.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.960
I guess I am.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.320
Kill him.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.800
Find him!

19:18.280 --> 19:20.320
Find his stupid body.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.520
[grunting]

19:30.720 --> 19:31.960
[panting]

19:55.320 --> 19:56.440
[grunting]

20:01.120 --> 20:02.600
[inaudible]

20:41.920 --> 20:43.000
[guards grunting]

21:15.200 --> 21:17.320
[sighs] The last piece.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.360
Don't stop. Don't ever stop fighting.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.040
Silence!

21:37.800 --> 21:39.320
[both grunting]

21:56.000 --> 21:56.840
Hello.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.400
What are you doing out here on your own?

22:04.200 --> 22:05.720
Guards!

22:05.800 --> 22:07.360
[guards grunting]

22:10.360 --> 22:11.360
[grunts]

22:12.320 --> 22:13.720
[grunting continues]

22:16.560 --> 22:18.680
You'll never know what the scroll says.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.040
I'll never give you the last page.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.200
Um...

22:25.000 --> 22:27.280
isn't that it right there on the floor?

22:32.960 --> 22:36.600
You can either run for your life...

22:36.680 --> 22:41.000
or die fighting me for a piece of paper.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.400
I'll give you five seconds.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.960
-[door thudding]
-Five...

22:50.440 --> 22:51.440
four...

22:53.240 --> 22:54.120
three...

22:59.160 --> 23:01.000
