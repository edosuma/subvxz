WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.905
- It's my lipstick.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.174
- Wow.

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
- It's also a flashlight.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.377
- It's either a Taser or a
vibrator.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.045
- Hit it.
Hit the red.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.082
- Whoo!

00:14.182 --> 00:15.416
- That's how you regulate.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.352
- She brought a Taser to the
auction, bro.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.788
America, you hear that ?
Ehh!

00:24.358 --> 00:26.026
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:26.127 --> 00:28.396
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:28.496 --> 00:29.897
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:29.997 --> 00:31.899
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.234
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.568
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:34.668 --> 00:36.270
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:36.370 --> 00:37.805
- You shut your face.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.973
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.142
- We're back, baby!

00:45.379 --> 00:46.980
- Riverside, baby.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.482
- I'm happy to be back.

00:48.582 --> 00:49.783
- Got a lot of memories here.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.552
- Yeah.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.422
- I used to cut classes right
here in Riverside, but now,

00:54.522 --> 00:55.789
I'm cutting locks.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.659
Right across from this auction
is North High.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.128
And I used to be a Husky.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.235
- So today Riverside it is.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.637
I know for a fact that I'm the
head honko out here.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.340
That's right, honko.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.742
Today I'm el jefe, the boss,

01:14.842 --> 01:17.978
so they better not mess with me,
or they're gonna get the horn.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.947
Beep-beep.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.915
40 years of doing this now,

01:22.015 --> 01:24.252
and I plan on buying nothing but
the best.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.287
It's action time.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.721
- Loving these adventures,
though.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.823
Coming from Vegas, like,
the drive out here is, like,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.459
off the chain, but you know
what?

01:31.559 --> 01:32.960
It's funny.
Like, how people look at things

01:33.060 --> 01:34.595
in California is not how we see
it in Vegas.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.330
It's a totally different market.
- Oh, I noticed that.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.767
- Right, so what we see and what
we value somebody else may not.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.335
That could work to our
advantage.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.736
- 'Cause I feel like they're
looking at us like we're crazy.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.505
- Right
The only kind of crazy we are...

01:44.605 --> 01:46.807
both: Is crazy about vintage.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.108
- They trying to test us out,
but they don't know

01:48.209 --> 01:49.243
us Vegas girls are ready

01:49.343 --> 01:50.411
They don't know.
- They don't know.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.180
- They don't know.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.215
- Okay, so J., we're going on
vacation.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.450
We probably want to just do,
like, small stuff

01:56.550 --> 01:57.918
so that we can get through it
fast

01:58.018 --> 01:59.853
so we don't have a bunch of work
before we leave and...

01:59.953 --> 02:02.590
- Well, I brought our vacation
money with me today,

02:02.690 --> 02:05.526
so really what I'm trying to do
here is parlay

02:05.626 --> 02:09.397
some of this vacation money
to bump it up.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.798
No?

02:10.898 --> 02:13.100
The more money I make, the more
mojitos I get.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.102
Got my spray-on tan.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.170
I'm ready to rock.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.772
- Yeah, got to.

02:18.872 --> 02:22.210
*

02:22.310 --> 02:24.378
- Time to go to war, son.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.647
My little vest right here is
gonna make sure

02:26.747 --> 02:29.317
if anybody try to bid me up,
it's gonna bounce right off.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.951
- That's--that's bulletproof,
man.

02:31.051 --> 02:31.952
- Yeah.
- Look where the bullets

02:32.052 --> 02:33.554
have bounced off that thing.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.988
- And when they try to raise the
bids up, it gonna bounce off.

02:35.088 --> 02:36.857
- Bounce right off.
- Then let's stay at 100.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.226
- I love that.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.761
- There seems like a lot more
people, right?

02:40.861 --> 02:42.963
- Yeah, we've got some more
people.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.334
- Perfect.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.569
- Well, if you forget, there's
an E for Edwina...

02:48.669 --> 02:49.903
- Oh, yeah, S for Shana.
- And there's an S for Shana.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.239
- Nice.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.673
- So we hear you're the gambler,
but...

02:52.773 --> 02:54.275
- You want to flip for 100
bucks?

02:54.375 --> 02:56.344
- Oh, damn.
- Oh, he is a gambler.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.511
- Yeah.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.281
I see my reputation has conceded
me.

03:00.381 --> 03:03.083
Don't know if that's a good
thing or a bad thing.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.719
All right, and hold your finger
up there like this.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.920
- Okay, I'll play.
I'll play with you.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.489
- That's your thumb.
I said your finger.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.824
both: Ohh.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.260
- You guys are gonna be a piece
of cake.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.695
- Oh, my God.
He just ran through us. What?

03:14.795 --> 03:15.996
- Welcome to Riverside.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.130
We've got rules.
You're gonna go to the unit.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.232
We're gonna remove the lock.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.633
We're gonna give your five
minutes.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.168
You take a look around.
You can't go inside the unit.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.470
You can't open any boxes.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.837
And whoever's got the most money
in their pocket

03:23.937 --> 03:25.038
can own it today;
are you ready?

03:25.138 --> 03:26.206
- Right on.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.477
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

03:29.577 --> 03:33.647
- How long have you two been
together?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.082
You interested?
- Shh.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.417
- No.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.851
That's my line.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.086
- All right, folks, come on.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.121
Good things come in a hallway.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.258
There we go.

03:44.358 --> 03:47.828
- Well, we do have a nice little
locker here full of books

03:47.928 --> 03:51.131
and just--just all books, man.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.933
They say that reading is
fundamental,

03:53.033 --> 03:55.603
but you would have to be mental
to bid on this one.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.472
- Okay, look, we've got three
bins.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.040
- Look at the books.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.375
It's foreign.
Those are foreign books.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.644
- Ooh, all right.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.012
I want it.
- Yep, this one's ours.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.046
- I'm getting it, no matter
what.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.415
It's ours, done.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.849
*

04:08.949 --> 04:10.250
- A lot of books.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.353
I see this big old toolbox.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.421
I love these chairs.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.689
WWE every day, man.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.824
Suckers.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.459
- This ain't nothing, books.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.161
There's, like, a chest back
there, but there's nothing that

04:21.261 --> 04:23.697
would lead me to believe there's
value in here.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.633
Nothing?
- Nope, nothing.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.369
- Nada que pada.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.703
- All right, if you're ready to
go, I'm ready to go

04:29.803 --> 04:30.971
and look at this one;
here we go.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.506
- A studious unit.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.342
- A studious unit.
I like that, Laura.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.876
And give me $25.
- 25.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.747
45 there, 55 now.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.915
I've got 65.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.284
I've got 75.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.053
85, give me 95.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.856
Ladies...

04:48.956 --> 04:50.424
It's 105, 115 there.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.360
125 there. 135 now.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.863
145 there. 155 now.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.131
165 where? 165 sir.

04:58.231 --> 05:02.102
Ladies, 175, 185, 175, 185, 195.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.705
205.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.509
215.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.444
I've got 225.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.346
235 going once.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.015
235 going twice.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.751
Sold it your way.
Sisters got it for 225.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.456
- Clearly no one else can read
how good this locker really is.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.557
All right.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.758
- Whew.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.926
Baghdad?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.127
- Who's this smart
mother?

05:27.227 --> 05:29.329
- Weird thing.
"Introduction to Chemistry"?

05:29.430 --> 05:30.764
- Okay, these books are, like,
50 cents apiece.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.501
So this box is, like...
both: 10 bucks.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.702
*

05:34.802 --> 05:36.404
Oh, my God.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.271
"God and Sex: What
the Bible Really Says"?

05:38.372 --> 05:39.640
- Yes.
- Random page.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.609
both: "Out of the ear came
something to eat."

05:41.709 --> 05:43.511
- I knew it.

05:43.611 --> 05:46.279
- Hey, if you want to get to my
heart, eat.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.981
- If there's books in here, I'm
gonna lose it.

05:51.685 --> 05:56.757
Ready?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.192
- Not book, not book, not book,
not books.
Not book

05:59.292 --> 06:01.161
It's books.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.430
Pan Am.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.031
Wasn't it an airline?
- Yeah.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.365
- But they're out of business.
- They are.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.534
The old-school headphones.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.301
- Oh, my gosh.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.603
- So would you like to watch the
movie?

06:09.703 --> 06:10.938
- Yes, I would.

06:11.038 --> 06:11.939
- We're playing "Straight Outta
Compton."

06:12.039 --> 06:16.376
- All right, $10 bin.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.278
Military equipment.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.714
Oh, my God. I love it.
- Edwina...

06:20.814 --> 06:22.082
Scandinavia.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.784
- They're maps, I think.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.453
What is this?

06:25.553 --> 06:27.187
This , it was made off
of, like, Constitution paper.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.822
It's old as .
- This is beautiful. Okay.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.023
- What does it say at the
bottom?

06:30.123 --> 06:31.291
- Ohh.
- With the Pan Am.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.726
both: Yes.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.327
- Oh, my gosh.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.830
- "Now direct service to
Scandinavia."

06:36.930 --> 06:40.067
- That is so cool.
These are vintage for sure.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.234
Is there a year on them?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.771
- 1950.
- Ooh.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.205
- I feel, like, put these to the
side,

06:45.305 --> 06:46.840
'cause I think I'd like to find
out how much these are.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.075
- These definitely look
collectible.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.943
They have the vintage feel we
love.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.579
- Definitely.
- Oh, my God.

06:51.679 --> 06:52.613
- All right, you've got to help
me--

06:52.713 --> 06:54.247
- Now I'm going back in time.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.415
This is a gun cleaner.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.550
Oh, this is an M-16.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.818
I need this for my M-16.

06:57.918 --> 06:58.919
- Yes.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.353
- I'm impressed.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.989
Bet you didn't know Edwina was
a badass.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.458
- Combat medic, served Kosovo
and Bosnia, representing.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.759
- That's, like a pashmina.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.160
- Well, if they were stationed
overseas,

07:07.260 --> 07:08.729
they would use that to keep dry.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.097
Okay, this is an ammo case.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.865
I feel like this is, like, a
$100 bin easily.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.100
- Yep.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.301
, though.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.636
- I am curious about that.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.637
- Okay, but that could be worth
something.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.572
- Okay.
- All right.

07:18.672 --> 07:22.242
- Come on, y'all, let's see what
we got in Riverside.

07:22.342 --> 07:26.446
*

07:26.547 --> 07:29.082
- Wheelchairs, cute little
trike.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.718
Refrigerator in the back.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.953
If it goes cheap enough, it's
okay, but I don't see anything

07:33.053 --> 07:35.322
in here to make me get all wound
up.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.924
*

07:37.024 --> 07:38.358
- All right, look.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.960
That trike looks a little
vintage; it's really cute.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.495
- There's a bunch of records.
You see that stuff on top?

07:41.595 --> 07:42.796
- Yeah, the records up top, but
I really want to know

07:42.896 --> 07:44.064
what's in that laundry basket.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.098
I feel like the hit would be in
that.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.000
- Maybe.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.270
- I wish I could get that
air-conditioner right now.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.805
Yeah, I want that bike.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.741
I think I could use that bike
for something.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.843
Yeah, I'm bidding on this.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.177
- Um...

07:57.277 --> 07:58.812
- Here's what I think;
a lot of wheels in here.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.181
- Uh...
- Laundry basket.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.683
- I don't like it at all.

08:02.783 --> 08:03.884
- All right, and if you're ready
to go, I'm ready to go,

08:03.984 --> 08:05.285
and here we go, and how much
money?

08:05.385 --> 08:06.319
What's your pleasure?
What are you gonna pay?

08:06.419 --> 08:07.721
Look at me, $50...
50 there.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.157
75 where?

08:10.257 --> 08:11.424
100 there. 125 there.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.995
150. 175 right there.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.130
250.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.034
275. 325.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.905
I got 350 and 375 where?

08:25.005 --> 08:28.441
375. 400?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.611
I got 375 going once.
400 going twice.

08:30.711 --> 08:34.147
375.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.284
Sold this way, Kenny.
375 winner.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.786
- They tried to target Kenny,

08:38.886 --> 08:42.055
but they haven't even got a
shot.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.091
- We got good stuff coming up,
folks.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.393
Come on.
Follow the lady.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.361
- Wait for me.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.431
You know, in 40 years, I've
probably bought 10,000 lockers.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.733
So...
- Wow, 10,000.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.935
- I've got a little bit of
experience, yeah.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.606
- That's 9,899 more...

08:58.706 --> 09:00.473
- More than we have.
- More than us.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.710
- If I've bought 10,000 lockers,

09:02.810 --> 09:05.846
and they've bought 9,899 less
than me,

09:05.946 --> 09:10.684
that means that I've bought a
whole lot of lockers.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.152
- All right, come on.

09:12.252 --> 09:16.523
I'm gonna do a little peekaboo,
baby, yoo-hoo.

09:16.624 --> 09:17.958
both: Ooh.

09:18.058 --> 09:22.062
*

09:22.162 --> 09:23.764
- There's a little drum machine
right there,

09:23.864 --> 09:27.034
a little portable PA speaker,
synthesizer.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.301
- Let's see what the hell's in
here.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.138
There's a nice toolbox,
a keyboard.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.973
What the hell is that?
- That's brass.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.108
- I want to know what's in that
chest.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.010
Okay.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.879
- I like it.
- There's a lot of good...

09:38.979 --> 09:40.180
- It's fun.
- Musical equipment.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.715
- Yeah, easy.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.717
*

09:43.817 --> 09:46.186
- This locker's one of those bid
on what you see lockers.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.089
Got a speaker in here,
a drone.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.792
Got some books.
So we'll sit back and see

09:51.892 --> 09:52.926
what this locker brings.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.295
*

09:55.395 --> 09:57.064
- Uh-oh.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.833
This speaker here, I know it
caught Jarrod's eye.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.102
*

10:02.202 --> 10:03.837
And Jarrod gonna bid on this.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.473
I know that, but I like that
keyboard in there.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.675
Play some music.

10:07.775 --> 10:08.742
- All right, you give me how
much?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.043
You give me 200...
- 200.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.144
- All right...

10:11.244 --> 10:14.581
- Tell him, 200.

10:14.682 --> 10:18.518
250. 300? 350.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.487
And 400.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.622
- Tell him, folks.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.157
- 500. 550.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.093
I've got 500 bucks. 550.
And 600.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.396
650. 700.

10:29.496 --> 10:32.399
I've got 700.
both: 725.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.168
I've got 750. 775.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.503
- Oh, my God.
- 750, 775.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.539
$775 there. 800 there.
825.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.042
I've got 800 bucks. 825.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.446
- 875. 875. 875.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.447
925.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.850
- Tell him, now.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.251
- 950. 950.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.786
I've got 925.

10:52.886 --> 10:56.957
950 going once. 925.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.959
- 950 going once. 925.
950 going twice.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.695
950, you in?

11:01.795 --> 11:04.097
950. 950. 975.
I got 950.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.432
And 975 to you.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.034
950. 975 going once.
950. 975 going twice.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.335
both: No.
- Shaking her head no.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.970
All in, all through, all
through, we're done

11:10.070 --> 11:14.574
with a bid $975, fair warning,
and I sold it your way, $950.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.777
Jarrod and Brandi.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.846
- Whoo! Thank you, folks.
That's the end of the sale.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.849
Don't forget to pay the lady.
Thank you, everyone.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.450
- Sometimes when you're the
boss,

11:23.550 --> 11:25.385
you've got to make those tough
decisions.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.655
However, it wasn't a tough
decision not to buy today.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.658
- See how many punts.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.226
- Rake in the dough.
- Yeah.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.662
- I got cleanup on this unit.
- There's a baseball bat.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.597
You know, knock it out of the
park on this unit.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.968
Does this unit look like a home
run?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.635
- Are we gonna be singing
beautiful music

11:42.736 --> 11:45.538
because of this unit?

11:45.638 --> 11:46.706
I don't know.
- I think you're--

11:46.807 --> 11:47.908
- They were all stupid.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.476
- That one was the worst,
though.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.111
You win.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.813
- You win.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.516
My little vest right here kept
the price low.

11:56.616 --> 12:00.187
I got this locker for 375
smackeroonies.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.688
*

12:01.789 --> 12:03.957
The main reason why I wanted
this unit is because of

12:04.057 --> 12:05.759
the Red Baron right here.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.694
I know it needs some air in the
tires,

12:07.795 --> 12:12.232
but if I can get my knees on
there...

12:12.332 --> 12:13.733
ooh, my nuts.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.468
My nuts.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.071
Putting a price on the Red Baron
is something Kenny can't do.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.374
And I'm keeping it all for
myself. Vroom.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.110
Right this way.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.745
Wheelchair.
I'd say about 50 bucks.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.180
Here go another wheelchair,

12:27.280 --> 12:30.784
another 50.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.252
Yeah, buddy.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.686
Whee-hee!

12:33.787 --> 12:38.725
This here, right here
is worth $125.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.094
If it got wheels, Kenny's gonna
make money.

12:41.194 --> 12:44.164
What is this?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.166
Hmm, electrical fixtures,
whole box.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.768
I'd say about 50 bucks.

12:48.869 --> 12:52.372
Car seat, one, two, three, four.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.575
There are all the seats for 100
bucks.

12:55.675 --> 12:59.847
Two chairs, $5 apiece.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.314
Nothing.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.117
What's this?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.118
Nothing.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.653
Got some records right here.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.421
The hit song in this must be
called

13:08.521 --> 13:09.789
"Heavy As a Mother."

13:09.890 --> 13:12.425
Get about 75 bucks.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.693
The White House.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.196
It's a nice box;
it's heavy as hell.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.132
See what's in here.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.401
Smell like for a cigar or
something.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.271
If President Clinton had this
White House to hold his cigars,

13:24.371 --> 13:26.173
he wouldn't have gotten in so
much trouble.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.876
Need to go get the White House
checked out.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.511
I mean, I need to go get the
White House smoked out.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.681
Uh-oh.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.885
Look like one of them chocolate
lava machines.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.087
A hookah table or something?

13:40.187 --> 13:42.956
This stogie contraption might go
with house right here

13:43.056 --> 13:44.892
with the cigars.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.994
Hmm, I'm about to get that
checked out.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.797
Okay, America...

13:50.898 --> 13:53.166
Hmm, clean.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.236
Get about 20 bucks for this
thing right here, nice.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.238
See this air-conditioner right
here?

13:58.338 --> 14:02.142
I say it's a cool 25 big ones.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.012
All I've got to do is get the
White House checked out

14:05.112 --> 14:06.513
and the hookah table.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.116
I think I smoked everyone else
with this here locker.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.750
Kumbaya.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.686
*

14:13.786 --> 14:16.523
Kenny go.

14:16.623 --> 14:23.496
*

14:23.596 --> 14:24.898
- Let's pull out the no money,

14:24.998 --> 14:26.766
and then we'll get to the big
money.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.701
- Jarrod better be right that
there's big money in here.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.870
Because we already spent $1,000
on this unit.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.105
And that is big money.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.707
- Whoa.
You know what?

14:34.807 --> 14:35.808
- No money.
- I don't know about that.

14:35.909 --> 14:36.809
Are you sure?
- It's empty.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.579
- Those things are super light.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.548
Ha! Ha!

14:41.648 --> 14:43.816
Get the  out of here.
Yeah.

14:43.917 --> 14:44.952
- Wow.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.519
Is that the Galaxy on Fire?

14:46.619 --> 14:49.189
- That's 100 bucks I was not
counting on.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.958
- All right, so how much on
this?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.694
50 bucks probably.

14:54.794 --> 14:55.862
Look at this.
- Yeah.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.431
- A drum machine.
- Turn it on.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.200
- No batteries.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.769
It's a nice and cheap one, maybe
20 bucks.

15:02.869 --> 15:03.903
What about this guy?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.272
- Isn't that what you used to
pull out

15:05.372 --> 15:06.940
when the chicks came over?
"Let me go get my Casio."

15:07.040 --> 15:08.141
- Yeah.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.742
- Jarrod can really tickle the
ivories.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.844
How much for the keyboard?

15:11.945 --> 15:14.481
- I feel like it's maybe a $100
keyboard.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.249
- I know.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.052
I was really hoping to find more
valuable stuff in here.

15:19.152 --> 15:22.289
- Hmm.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.557
Nope.
- Trash, trash.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.825
- Oh, tampons.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.827
- Oh, Brandi, check this
out.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.532
- These are, like, wannabe
antiques.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.201
Brandi, what are we at?

15:34.301 --> 15:36.236
- Uh...

15:36.336 --> 15:37.971
- We are at Disappointment Lane.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.672
- Check the dresser drawers.
That's it.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.975
That's all that's left.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.714
- Something.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.182
- I hope it's worth, like, 600
bucks.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.550
Me too.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.918
- Come on.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.454
- Ohh.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.822
Riverside bell.

15:55.922 --> 15:59.092
- It is; it's like a ceramic
Riverside bell.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.727
And if you're in Riverside, you
could probably get

16:00.827 --> 16:02.262
some money for this.

16:02.362 --> 16:05.198
So if this was our vacation
fund,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.634
instead of more fund,
we're gonna have less fund.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.105
*

16:12.205 --> 16:14.341
- We are Pan Am ready.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.342
Oh, my goodness.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.380
We are so excited to get
dressed up in our vintage.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.782
- And we're about to flip this
money.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.417
- Welcome to Flight Path Museum.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.053
This is on the ground of LAX,

16:26.153 --> 16:27.454
and we thought this would be a
great place to meet,

16:27.554 --> 16:28.755
because it can show you a little
bit more about

16:28.855 --> 16:30.290
the history of Pan Am.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.326
You know, Pan Am has been in
business over 90 years, 1927.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.994
The company flew up until 2008,
actually,

16:35.095 --> 16:36.363
and not a lot of people know
that.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.698
- Yeah, as a regional carrier.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.468
And so what we do now is,
we run a licensing program

16:41.568 --> 16:43.703
to kind of leverage the brand
equity and goodwill

16:43.803 --> 16:46.005
that Pan Am's laid out over 90
years,

16:46.106 --> 16:48.441
that golden age of aviation and
the fun, the excitement,

16:48.541 --> 16:50.077
and the travel.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.511
Well, let's take a peek at some
of these if you don't mind.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.146
- Okay.
- Yes, please.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.316
- So you can see a copyright in
1950 Pan American World Airways.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.017
So this looks to be an original.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.652
I will say that.

16:59.752 --> 17:03.290
So...ahh, this is an early logo.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.492
This is what we consider the
wing and globe logo.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.095
This is prior to the iconic Pan
Am logo, which we have here,

17:08.195 --> 17:09.896
which we kind of consider our
globe logo.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.398
And this is a propeller-driven
plane.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.500
This is prior to jet engines.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.767
So this is a very interesting
poster.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.103
It's very early.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.670
- Brice is really loving this
poster.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.339
And I am getting excited.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.641
- So this is Hawaii, which is in
itself

17:21.741 --> 17:23.243
a rather collectible poster.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.612
This is a very exotic
destination.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.248
This is approximately 1957.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.583
This has the new logo.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.752
All right, so let's talk about
some value on these items.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.087
- All right.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.423
- The two posters in their
current condition...

17:36.523 --> 17:39.126
*

17:39.226 --> 17:40.160
I would say...

17:40.260 --> 17:41.861
*

17:41.961 --> 17:43.796
$1,000.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.065
- Yeah.
- We need to go in business

17:46.166 --> 17:47.567
in posters.
- Thank you.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.338
I'm gonna start drawing today.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.107
*

17:54.207 --> 17:56.209
- Anto.
- Kenny.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.744
- Yeah.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.779
- I'm meeting up with the czar
of cigars,

17:59.879 --> 18:01.514
Anto Kamarian.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.516
Can you give me a little
history lesson

18:03.616 --> 18:04.817
on this stuff right here?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.018
- Absolutely.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.688
This White House humidor came
out

18:08.788 --> 18:10.357
maybe about 10, 12 years ago.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.758
- Uh-uh.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.328
- It's one of four designs:
Lincoln Memorial,

18:15.428 --> 18:19.266
Jefferson, the White House, and
Capitol Building.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.833
- Capitol Building.
- Yes.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.271
And they did a very limited
edition of the White House.

18:24.371 --> 18:28.208
This is a very, very unique
item.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.844
- Can you give me a price for
something like this right here?

18:31.944 --> 18:35.148
- Obviously, there are a few
damages.

18:35.248 --> 18:39.386
But still, at its minimum, this
would be approximately...

18:39.486 --> 18:41.053
*

18:41.154 --> 18:42.121
$1,500.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.656
- Come on, bro.
For real?

18:43.756 --> 18:45.091
- This is a beautiful humidor,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.327
and it's--the uniqueness is
where the price is.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.695
- Yeah.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.597
Well, this is the next item I
got right here

18:50.697 --> 18:52.165
for you to take a look at, my
man.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.466
- Oh, my.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.567
Oh, my.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.405
- This is an amazing piece.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.407
The handcrafting on it.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.509
I even have to put my cigar
down.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.477
.
Must be worth something.

19:04.577 --> 19:08.181
- I can't say enough of this
ashtray, I tell you.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.117
This is a very old piece.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.322
- It says it right here.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.392
That's the year?
- That's the year.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.893
- This thing is worth some
money.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.629
We about to get to the
nitty-gritty.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.798
- I'm about to reach in my
pocket and give you an offer.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.334
.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.436
- It's an incredible piece.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.971
It's in a perfect condition.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.473
*

19:33.573 --> 19:36.909
If I had this piece...
- Uh-huh.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.247
*

19:40.347 --> 19:43.616
- I wouldn't sell this piece for
less than $3,000.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.553
*

19:46.653 --> 19:47.587
- I didn't hear you right.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.356
Can you repeat yourself,
soldier?

19:49.456 --> 19:51.258
- $3,000.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.925
- Damn.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.027
This is my biggest score ever,
bro,

19:55.127 --> 19:56.496
my biggest score ever.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.699
Kaboom, shaka-laka.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.635
announcer: Kenny Crossley had a
smokin' good time

20:02.735 --> 20:06.273
rolling up over 4,600 big ones.

20:06.373 --> 20:11.811
Edwina and Shana tacked up 900
bucks with their Pan Am posters.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.481
Darrell Sheets showed his
frugal side

20:14.581 --> 20:16.649
deciding not to buy.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.485
And Jarrod and Brandi should
have left

20:18.585 --> 20:22.855
for their vacation sooner.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.457
*

20:24.557 --> 20:27.226
- I'm just trying to educate you
guys; there's a matter daddy.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.897
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- So...

20:30.997 --> 20:32.899
You guys have a matter daddy in
your collection?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.334
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.968
- Do you know what a matter
daddy is?

20:36.068 --> 20:39.439
- No.
- Then ask.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.640
Ask.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.278
- You said, "What's the matter,
Daddy?"

20:45.378 --> 20:46.979
both: What's the matter, Daddy?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.981
- I just got it.
- He got us.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.082
- Finally.
