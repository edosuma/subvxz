<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.115 --> 00:17.948
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:21.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:30.862
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:30.930 --> 00:36.630
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:40.867
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:40.940 --> 00:43.875
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:43.943 --> 00:46.468
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:46.546 --> 00:48.537
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:55.722 --> 00:58.555
No don't... scream.

00:58.625 --> 01:01.788
<i>Daniel, what's wrong?</i>

01:01.861 --> 01:04.056
It was him. He was here.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.092
- Who was here?
- Bigfoot.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.160
<i>- "Bigfoot"?
- I swear it was him.</i>

01:11.237 --> 01:13.228
Oh, boy.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.640
When I came into the room
he fell out the window.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.083
God, you should have seen him.
He was gigantic.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.020
I'll get my shotgun and take a look.

02:48.201 --> 02:52.001
Al, where in the hell are you? Huh?

02:52.071 --> 02:54.699
Shh! Shh! Shh-Shh-

03:17.664 --> 03:19.996
I was startin' to worry about you, Henry.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.967
You were?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.527
We better get outta here
before Luke gets them dogs after us.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.133
Are you coming?

03:36.616 --> 03:39.813
<i>I swear it was him. Daniel,
we've been through this before.</i>

03:39.886 --> 03:43.117
But, Mom, I'm not lying!
He was here- Bigfoot!

03:43.189 --> 03:45.987
That's enough.
He- I saw him!

03:46.059 --> 03:48.391
He looked exactly like the time
I saw him with Dad.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.730
- Daniel, where are your glasses?
- Out in the truck.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.667
So you didn't see whoever you
saw very clearly.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.399
You don't believe me either.
You think I'm making this up.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.670
<i>- It was him.
- It was Henry Adams.</i>

04:03.743 --> 04:06.974
- Henry? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure. I lost him in the woods,

04:07.046 --> 04:09.105
but I found these outside the window.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.673
I want you to take the truck home.
I'll meet you there later.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.380
What are you gonna do? I'm
gettin'Jim Curtis to take a look.

04:15.455 --> 04:18.151
<i>- I'm going too.
- No.</i>

04:20.493 --> 04:24.361
Um, you stay with your mom.
Daniel.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.922
- I don't want to hear any
more of this monster talk.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.205
You okay, Henry?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.270
Yeah, I'm-

04:42.282 --> 04:44.910
I'm fine. Just a little tired
from runnin' uphill.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.748
Oh. Okay.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.811
Oh, man.

04:51.224 --> 04:55.058
<i>Over the years I have leaped
into a lot ofhairy situations.</i>

04:55.128 --> 04:57.961
<i>But this one
was more than I expected.</i>

04:58.031 --> 05:01.694
<i>And even though I didn't know who I was,
I did know who I wasn't.</i>

05:01.768 --> 05:03.702
<i>I wasn't Bigfoot.</i>

05:05.505 --> 05:08.133
<i>Although,
from the look of things,</i>

05:08.207 --> 05:10.835
<i>I wasn't far off.</i>

05:15.148 --> 05:18.447
<i>I think we lost him.</i>

05:18.518 --> 05:20.952
You okay, Henry?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.919
Yeah. I think so, yeah.

05:27.427 --> 05:30.225
Reminds me of the time in 'Nam...

05:30.296 --> 05:34.198
when I was, uh, flushin'
a tunnel near the D.M.Z.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.104
Charlie comes
diddy-boppin' right at me, so, uh,

05:39.172 --> 05:42.437
I duck into
a crack no bigger than a keg of beer.

05:44.444 --> 05:47.902
Then I did just like you taught me.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.540
You did?
S- Sure did.

05:52.151 --> 05:56.918
You told me if I was ever trapped
to just shut my eyes...

05:56.989 --> 05:59.219
<i>and pretend I was invisible.</i>

06:03.696 --> 06:08.360
I'll be damned if those bastards
didn't walk right past me.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.169
- So, did you get them?
- "Them"?

06:20.313 --> 06:23.111
<i>Don't goof on me, Henry.
You know I need them pills.</i>

06:24.951 --> 06:27.249
<i>Oh, the pills.</i>

06:27.320 --> 06:30.221
- Uh, he's talking about phe- phenytoin.
- Phenytoin?

06:30.289 --> 06:32.655
That's the ones.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.216
I don't wanna have
anymore of them fits, Henry.

06:35.294 --> 06:39.924
- So did you get them?
- Well, I had 'em.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.933
Then that, uh-

06:42.001 --> 06:44.595
that kid started screaming,
and I fell out the window.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.604
L- I must've dropped 'em. I'm sorry.

06:49.842 --> 06:52.743
- This ain't good, Henry.
- Listen, uh-

06:52.812 --> 06:54.404
- Roy- Roy Brown.
- Roy.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.177
<i>Um, I-I'll get you
some more pills, okay?</i>

06:58.251 --> 07:01.152
When? I don't want them snakes
in my head again.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.211
<i>Uh, Sam, you can't let him get upset.</i>

07:03.289 --> 07:06.486
Uh, Ziggy says there's a 95% chance
he's gonna have some kind of a seizure.

07:06.559 --> 07:10.051
- What are you talking about?
- God, I see them snakes!

07:10.129 --> 07:12.529
Like when I was in them tunnels!

07:12.598 --> 07:15.965
- Oh, Henry, I can't breathe!
- Okay, listen to me. Listen to me.

07:16.035 --> 07:17.798
You've got to relax.
No, I can't!

07:17.870 --> 07:19.633
Yes, you can!
Look at me! Can't-

07:19.705 --> 07:21.730
I'm gonna get
you the pills, all right?

07:21.808 --> 07:25.938
Right now, I want you to just
concentrate on breathing.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.446
Now breathe.
Attaboy.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.005
Clear your mind of everything
except breathing.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.847
Steady-

07:33.920 --> 07:35.512
I think he's coming around, Sam.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.648
<i>Good. There you
go. There you go.</i>

07:38.724 --> 07:42.285
That's it.
There you go.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.727
Okay.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.788
You better? Uh-huh.
Thanks, Henry.

07:46.866 --> 07:50.233
You're gonna be fine.
I'm, uh-

07:50.303 --> 07:54.399
I'm just goin' down to the
river, wash my face. Okay.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.408
I'm okay.

08:00.746 --> 08:03.579
What is goin' on here?

08:03.649 --> 08:06.083
I don't know,
but that was kinda close.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.553
Your name is, uh, Henry Adams,
and the little guy there is Roy-

08:09.622 --> 08:12.182
Roy Brown. You told me.
Wh-What else? Brown- Brown.

08:12.258 --> 08:15.091
Uh, it's November 6, 1972,
and you're in the mountains...

08:15.161 --> 08:17.186
here in the state of
Washington. Camping?

08:17.263 --> 08:19.356
No. No, you live here.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.162
You and Roy
were in Vietnam together.

08:22.235 --> 08:26.001
Uh, Henry was a grunt, and Roy was
a tunnel rat. What's a tunnel rat?

08:26.072 --> 08:28.233
Uh, well, it's a little guy, uh-

08:28.307 --> 08:32.174
Because of his size, he could burrow
down into tunnels and flush out the enemy.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.611
See, it was one of the most
dangerous jobs we had over there.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.910
In fact, Henry says that's how come
he got hurt. What happened to him?

08:37.984 --> 08:41.385
Well, they had tracked some V.C.
To a series of tunnels.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.922
So they sent Roy down in there
to check the location.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.982
But they knew
he was coming somehow, and he-

08:47.059 --> 08:51.359
he got a bullet in the head,
and that's how come he's a little... slow.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.468
Why are they living up here, Al?

08:57.537 --> 09:02.497
Well, a lot of vets decided they would stay
away from people when they got back home.

09:02.575 --> 09:06.636
Why? Simple
- no people, no war.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.949
Well, then, why am I here? Don't know
yet. Ziggy's still working on the data.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.316
Why don't you go back and see
if you can speed her along.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.322
Okay.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.381
Why don't you check
in the shack there?

09:19.458 --> 09:23.417
<i>There might be something in there
to help you figure this out.</i>

09:35.007 --> 09:38.568
You know, maybe we ought to deputize
a few more men and split into teams.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.578
<i>No.</i>

09:41.681 --> 09:43.842
I'll, uh, find 'em myself.

09:43.916 --> 09:48.216
Get a fresh start first thing
in the mornin'. All right.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.221
I'll see you then.

10:57.757 --> 11:01.420
<i>Putting the pieces of Henry's life together
wasn't going to be easy,</i>

11:01.494 --> 11:03.792
<i>but this picture was a beginning.</i>

11:03.863 --> 11:06.491
<i>I recognized Henry and Roy
right away.</i>

11:06.565 --> 11:09.432
<i>But it was another face
that caught my attention.</i>

11:09.502 --> 11:13.996
<i>It had been dark, but I was sure this was the
same man that had chased me with a shotgun.</i>

11:14.073 --> 11:16.940
<i>The question now was: Why?</i>

11:33.793 --> 11:39.459
"August 6, 1968.
We swept another enemy village today.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.969
"Just like the one yesterday
and the day before and the day before.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.870
<i>It still seems like a bad dream. "</i>

11:47.940 --> 11:50.374
Check those hooches up by river!

11:50.443 --> 11:53.310
I don't want to find a roach
movin' when we leave here!

11:53.379 --> 11:55.904
<i>All right.! You heard him.! Move out.!</i>

11:55.981 --> 11:58.779
<i>Anything?
We found a couple holes.</i>

11:58.851 --> 12:01.843
They were empty. Yeah, but
Charlie's been here, that's for sure.

12:01.921 --> 12:06.085
There's enough ammo down there to light up
half the jungle. I'm gonna level this place.

12:06.158 --> 12:08.149
What do you got?

12:08.227 --> 12:12.061
Nothing. Just an old man.
Let's go. Wait a second.

12:12.131 --> 12:14.759
We got orders to secure this village.
That's what we're gonna do.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.395
- John, it's just an old man.
- There's no young or old anymore.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.565
- There's just us and them.
- Can't do it.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.768
- What did you say?
- You heard me. I can't kill anymore people like that.

12:26.112 --> 12:29.172
Look, John, maybe he's right. I mean,
maybe we oughta bob it on outta here...

12:29.248 --> 12:31.341
and let them flyboys just
scorch the joint. Yeah.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.478
<i>Let's get outta here.! Let's go.! I'm all for
that. I got a bad feelin' about this place.</i>

12:36.555 --> 12:38.682
No.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.693
The man says this is a V.C. Supply point,
and we're to secure it.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.525
- You still don't get it, man.
- That's an order, Sergeant.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.326
- That doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

12:48.033 --> 12:51.525
<i>It has to matter.</i>

12:51.604 --> 12:54.767
<i>Then you do it.</i>

13:09.421 --> 13:11.446
<i>John.! John.!</i>

13:23.302 --> 13:26.794
"We just stood there and watched it burn.

13:26.872 --> 13:29.136
We never talked about it again. "

13:29.208 --> 13:31.438
<i>You writin'in your book again?</i>

13:32.444 --> 13:35.004
No, just doing a little, uh, reading.

13:38.083 --> 13:41.746
<i>Uh, come on in. Sit down.</i>

13:41.821 --> 13:44.756
Henry, you know I can't
do that. He's right.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.419
Uh, Henry says he's claustrophobic-
too much time underground.

13:49.728 --> 13:53.323
<i>I, uh, was just about to hit the sack.</i>

13:54.633 --> 13:58.467
And... I just wanted to thank you again
for helping me back there.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.562
No problem.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.434
Good night, Henry.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.173
Night, Roy.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.887
<i>He must've seen some
pretty terrible things over there.</i>

14:20.960 --> 14:24.293
<i>There was enough
to go around for everyone.</i>

14:25.297 --> 14:27.527
<i>You think he's gonna
be all right sleepin'out there?</i>

14:27.600 --> 14:29.534
Yeah.
For the time being.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.868
You found out why I'm here,
didn't you?

14:33.939 --> 14:36.908
Well, you're here
to get Roy the medication.

14:36.976 --> 14:41.777
Uh, but if you don't,
Ziggy says there's a 97.6% chance...

14:41.847 --> 14:45.715
that tomorrow night
he'll have another seizure and die.

15:03.936 --> 15:07.633
So, how long are you gonna
give me the silent treatment?

15:08.841 --> 15:11.071
You don't believe me.

15:11.143 --> 15:13.373
Honey,
it's not a question of believing you.

15:13.445 --> 15:18.109
It's just that there comes a time
when we all have to let go of our fantasies.

15:18.183 --> 15:20.117
<i>Bigfoot is real.</i>

15:20.185 --> 15:23.313
Mr. Hawkins said he saw him. He even
said he ate dinner with him once.

15:23.389 --> 15:27.291
Daniel, I have told you to stay away from that
old man. You could get hurt up by that dam!

15:27.359 --> 15:29.554
Mom, why do you always
treat me like a baby?

15:29.628 --> 15:32.188
Just because Dad died,
doesn't mean I will too.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.566
Gettin' cold outside.

15:38.637 --> 15:41.299
Get you some coffee.

15:41.373 --> 15:45.104
Did you see him?
Who? Bigfoot?

15:47.279 --> 15:50.544
No, and I didn't see the Loch Ness monster,

15:50.616 --> 15:53.016
or little green men from Mars either.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.952
Daniel, you can't go around
tellin' people you saw something...

15:57.022 --> 15:59.217
<i>that doesn't exist.
But, I did-</i>

15:59.291 --> 16:01.316
But nothing!

16:02.494 --> 16:05.895
What you saw tonight
was a man named Henry Adams-

16:05.965 --> 16:07.933
a very disturbed
and troubled man.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.198
So I don't want you goin' to school and tellin'
your friends that you saw something that you didn't.

16:12.271 --> 16:16.332
You think I made this up? I think
it's time for you to grow up.

16:16.408 --> 16:18.239
<i>Luke, don't-
No.</i>

16:18.310 --> 16:21.279
Someone's got to say it.
Somebody's gotta be the father around here.

16:21.347 --> 16:24.908
But you're not my father.
My father died in Vietnam!

16:24.984 --> 16:27.885
Oh, Daniel!
No, let him go.

16:27.953 --> 16:30.751
<i>Was that absolutely necessary?</i>

16:30.823 --> 16:34.315
- He's just a boy.
- But not mine, right?

16:34.393 --> 16:38.159
You can't expect him
to forget his father.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.221
John may be dead,
but his memory isn't.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.824
And do you think
I don't remember him?

16:42.901 --> 16:45.893
Do you think I don't see his face
every time I look at that kid?

16:55.848 --> 17:00.217
<i>Henry's journal was as moving and honest
as anything I'd ever read.</i>

17:00.285 --> 17:04.278
<i>And the story it told
was as unbelievable as it was tragic.</i>

17:04.356 --> 17:06.550
<i>Piece of the puzzle?</i>

17:08.127 --> 17:11.493
I'm not sure I like the picture
I'm starting to see.

17:13.265 --> 17:16.029
What is this?
Henry's journal.

17:16.101 --> 17:20.127
Al, there were four of them who went off to Vietnam
- high school buddies.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.874
Why do I get the feeling this story
does not have a happy ending?

17:31.150 --> 17:35.814
I can't remember the last time
I didn't have to tell you to go to bed.

17:37.956 --> 17:40.049
You don't have a fever.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.766
This picture was taken just
before he left.

17:49.835 --> 17:53.771
Your father was so nervous
he could barely stand still.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.667
God,
it seems like a long time ago.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.643
Do you still love him?

18:00.879 --> 18:03.712
Course I do.

18:03.782 --> 18:06.512
Your feelings for someone
don't change just because they die.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.718
I'll always love your father.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.617
Then why'd you marry Luke?

18:18.230 --> 18:23.031
Well, when your father died,
I was scared.

18:23.102 --> 18:27.334
You plan to spend your whole life with
someone and then suddenly they're gone.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.534
Luke was your father's best friend.
We shared the same pain.

18:32.244 --> 18:35.213
I don't know, Daniel.
It's hard to explain.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.017
Do you believe we saw him?

18:41.386 --> 18:44.549
<i>I think that you should go to sleep.</i>

18:51.797 --> 18:54.231
Daniel, I know all of this
is very confusing for you.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.029
<i>But Luke needs us now
more than ever.</i>

18:58.303 --> 19:01.238
I just hope you can be there for him.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.723
<i>I think it might snow tonight.</i>

19:30.569 --> 19:33.834
So what are you gonna do
about Henry and Roy?

19:33.906 --> 19:36.374
I'm gonna do my job.

19:36.441 --> 19:40.343
Luke.
Henry didn't mean to scare Daniel.

19:40.412 --> 19:43.040
He just wanted Roy's medication,
that's all.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.016
If Doc Kramer hadn't died, he wouldn't
even of had to break in like that.

19:46.084 --> 19:50.282
Kramer was giving Henry drugs? You
make it sound like he ran an opium den.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.687
Roy was sick.
He needs the medication...

19:52.758 --> 19:55.852
to control his seizures. Why didn't
he see a doctor like everybody else?

19:55.928 --> 19:58.260
Because he knows you'll arrest him
and put him in jail.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.924
Karen! He's a thief.
A thief.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.229
He stole a couple of chickens
because he was hungry.

20:03.302 --> 20:07.602
Why can't you just let this go?
Look. Look.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.039
I don't make the law,
I just enforce it.

20:14.012 --> 20:18.881
So, he thinks he was responsible
for the death of his best friend,

20:18.951 --> 20:22.148
but then
he marries the friend's wife?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.621
Look, according to the journal,

20:24.690 --> 20:29.821
John Burke was the ranking officer
on all sweep-and-destroy missions.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.729
Now, he tells Luke to go and secure
an enemy hooch.

20:33.799 --> 20:37.291
But Luke refuses,
so then John goes in instead,

20:37.369 --> 20:40.930
and there's an explosion. Well, he
could've been brought up on charges.

20:41.006 --> 20:44.237
If that journal is correct he
was disobeying orders. Yeah.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.243
Except that...

20:46.311 --> 20:50.372
there were only two witnesses,
and neither one of them ever came forward.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.383
Yeah, Henry and Roy.
You got it.

20:52.451 --> 20:56.649
No wonder Luke wanted to keep them out of the
picture. They're the only ones that know what happened.

20:56.722 --> 21:00.624
Unless maybe the wife-
Let's see, the wife's name-

21:00.692 --> 21:04.253
Karen. Do you suppose she
knew? That's a good question.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.588
You know, it-it's-
It's really crazy, Al.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.533
A man refuses to kill,
and then...

21:10.602 --> 21:13.036
spends the rest of his life
feeling guilty.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.268
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

21:21.680 --> 21:23.875
Roy.
What's happening?

21:23.949 --> 21:26.383
I thought you said he didn't die
until tomorrow night?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.476
Uhh, that's right, he does.

21:28.553 --> 21:31.351
But the seizures must be getting
stronger or something,

21:31.423 --> 21:33.823
the more he's off
of the medication.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.958
What are you doin'?

21:39.031 --> 21:42.467
- Tryin' to keep him from swallowing his tongue.
- Uh, Ziggy says he's gotta just...

21:42.534 --> 21:45.401
ride it out.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.928
Yeah.

21:52.911 --> 21:55.971
- That was scary.
- It's the...

21:56.048 --> 21:57.982
trauma from the head wound-

21:58.050 --> 22:01.577
affected the parts of the brain that
control the central nervous system.

22:01.653 --> 22:05.419
The phenytoin must
keep it in check somehow.

22:06.491 --> 22:10.052
I gotta get him into town.
He's gotta see a doctor.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.824
- No. You can't do that.
- Why not?

22:12.898 --> 22:15.389
Well, because there's
no doctor there to see.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.027
- What?
- He died. The doctor died...

22:18.103 --> 22:20.071
a couple of days ago.

22:20.138 --> 22:23.005
They're bringin' up a replacement,
and he's gonna be here, Ziggy says,

22:23.075 --> 22:25.134
uhh, the day after tomorrow.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.509
And anyway, if you take him
into town, Luke'll arrest him.

22:28.580 --> 22:32.016
- For what?
- Stealing chickens.

22:32.084 --> 22:35.281
- What?
- And not only that. After your escapade at the pharmacy tonight,

22:35.354 --> 22:37.288
there's a warrant out on you too.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.325
Al, I don't have a choice on this.
Just listen to me, Sam.

22:40.392 --> 22:43.020
<i>You gotta buy
an extra day or two for Roy...</i>

22:43.095 --> 22:45.086
Until this new doctor gets into town,

22:45.163 --> 22:49.293
and not go into town yourself because you'll
get arrested, and then he'll be a dead man.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.598
- Lobelia.
- Who's she?

22:57.676 --> 23:00.941
It's not a she. It's a plant.
An-An-An herb, actually.

23:01.012 --> 23:04.413
What the hell you talking about? You said I
couldn't get the medication from a doctor, right?

23:04.483 --> 23:06.474
Right. Maybe I can
get it somewhere else.

23:11.656 --> 23:15.353
So, uh,

23:15.427 --> 23:19.329
what the hell is it we're looking
for? It looks like a weed, right?

23:19.398 --> 23:24.131
But it's got blue and white flowers
that are split down the middle.

23:24.202 --> 23:26.329
Uh-huh.
And how does it work?

23:26.405 --> 23:29.704
Well, it's got this stuff in the petals
called chalcedonic acid.

23:29.775 --> 23:34.803
Uh, they act as a relaxant that suppress
certain hormones released in the brain.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.611
And the-the-the acid is supposed to help
with seizures or somethin'?

23:38.683 --> 23:41.049
Yeah. Well, that's the theory.
Well, how does Roy take it?

23:41.119 --> 23:44.213
Does he... smoke it or snort it
- No, no, no. Neither.

23:44.289 --> 23:46.621
Or rub it on his chest? I got
to boil it down into a drink.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.819
That way it'll be less toxic.
It won't be as effective as the phenytoin,

23:49.895 --> 23:52.227
but it should buy us enough ti-

23:57.002 --> 23:59.232
That's the stuff?
This is it.

24:02.407 --> 24:04.932
<i>What was that?</i>

24:05.010 --> 24:07.171
Probably just a little squirrel
or something.

24:07.245 --> 24:10.578
I, uh-You-You don't think
there's anything to this...

24:10.649 --> 24:13.413
Bigfoot stuff, do you?
No, I don't, Al.

24:13.485 --> 24:17.148
Look, I'm gonna go back and get
started with this, all right? Yeah.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.625
Yeah, you're probably right.
Probably just a-

24:21.693 --> 24:24.218
a tiny little squirrel.

24:39.911 --> 24:43.369
<i>Last night I'd wondered what it
would be like to give up civilization...</i>

24:43.448 --> 24:46.815
<i>and live life isolated from the world.</i>

24:46.885 --> 24:49.786
<i>This morning I had the answer.</i>

24:49.855 --> 24:52.483
Good morning.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.424
Can I get you anything?

24:58.930 --> 25:01.057
I guess not.

25:08.406 --> 25:10.431
Bacon?

25:17.482 --> 25:20.849
Well, look who the cat drug up.

25:20.919 --> 25:24.047
I thought you were
gonna sleep all day.

25:24.122 --> 25:28.752
Yeah. Well, I guess my,
uh, alarm didn't go off. Oh.

25:28.827 --> 25:32.888
Sure smells good.
Well, it's all yours.

25:32.964 --> 25:34.989
I ate over an hour ago.

25:36.134 --> 25:38.932
I got you some eggs for ya, too.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.929
Thanks.
Yeah.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.704
How you feelin'?
Oh. Fit as a fiddle.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.011
I don't know what was in that stuff
you gave me last night, but, uh,

25:51.082 --> 25:54.051
I slept like a dead man.

25:54.119 --> 25:56.246
Really?
Yeah.

25:57.822 --> 25:59.949
I, uh-

26:00.025 --> 26:02.550
I had that dream again last night.

26:02.627 --> 26:05.892
Dream?
You know, about, uh-

26:06.965 --> 26:08.899
uh, her.

26:11.303 --> 26:14.568
You know-
You know, um, Wanda.

26:14.639 --> 26:18.200
Wanda? Come on,
Henry. Wanda.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.642
She sat behind us in history class.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.737
Oh, yeah, Wanda.

26:22.814 --> 26:26.750
Yeah. Well, you wouldn't be laughin'
if you knew how we was carryin' on.

26:30.121 --> 26:32.112
Wha-What am I gonna
do with you?

26:35.360 --> 26:38.193
Don't shoot.

26:41.199 --> 26:45.932
<i>- Better pack some extra ammo.
- You expectin' trouble?</i>

26:46.004 --> 26:48.734
I don't know what to expect.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.866
These two fellas are friends
of yours, aren't they?

26:53.478 --> 26:55.810
Better go gas up the car.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.075
Yeah, right.

26:58.149 --> 27:02.609
Luke, he's gone. I went into his room to
get him up for school, and he wasn't there.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.882
Hold on a second.
Who's gone? Daniel!

27:04.956 --> 27:08.448
H- H-His room was empty. The window
was open. His camera was gone.

27:08.526 --> 27:11.120
I think he's gone up into the
mountains. Why would he do that?

27:11.196 --> 27:13.494
To get a picture of Bigfoot.
What?

27:13.565 --> 27:16.227
When we were talking last night,
he talked about proving us wrong.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.394
He said if he had proof,
we would have to believe him.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.631
God, I just thought he was angry.

27:20.705 --> 27:23.139
God, Luke. What if something
happens to him? It's-It's all right.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.142
<i>It's all right.</i>

27:25.210 --> 27:27.201
I'll find him.

27:27.278 --> 27:30.714
You go home in case someone
finds him and tries to call.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.410
No.
No, please. Do as I say.

27:43.161 --> 27:46.130
You-You- You better slow
down. You're gonna get hiccups.

27:46.197 --> 27:50.463
Isn't that right, Henry?
That's right.

27:51.469 --> 27:53.699
How long have you been
wandering around up here?

27:55.573 --> 27:57.700
All night.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.337
You're Henry Adams, aren't you?

28:04.149 --> 28:07.175
- And you'reJohn's son.
- Daniel.

28:07.252 --> 28:10.119
<i>Daniel.
Like Daniel Boone.</i>

28:10.188 --> 28:12.782
You know, he killed a grizzly
with has bare hands?

28:12.857 --> 28:15.018
Hmm.

28:15.093 --> 28:17.459
Anybody else know
you're up here, Daniel?

28:19.464 --> 28:23.093
They do now.
Great.

28:23.168 --> 28:26.695
Now Luke can add kidnapping
to the breaking and entering charges.

28:26.771 --> 28:29.035
Luke says you two are crazy.

28:29.107 --> 28:31.575
Luke said that?

28:33.311 --> 28:37.247
You know, he scared the heck
out of me last night.

28:37.315 --> 28:39.374
<i>Didn't you?
I thought you were Bigfoot.</i>

28:39.451 --> 28:42.079
Bigfoot?

28:42.153 --> 28:47.284
Well, come to think of it,
you do kinda look like him, Henry.

28:47.358 --> 28:50.589
'Cept you're a couple feet shorter
and you smell worse. Thanks a lot.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.994
Have you seen him?

28:53.064 --> 28:55.055
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we seen him.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.795
<i>Great. Now he's hallucinating.</i>

28:57.869 --> 29:00.565
You know, I saw him once.
Oh, yeah?

29:00.638 --> 29:03.732
Yeah. I was a kid and my dad
took me out to Willamette Peak.

29:03.808 --> 29:06.834
Well, that's where we saw him!
Eh-

29:08.480 --> 29:12.177
You know, I just got them n-needles
shooting through my head again.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.617
All right. Just take it easy.
Okay. I think I'm okay.

29:15.687 --> 29:18.087
You sure?
Yeah.

29:18.156 --> 29:21.091
Hey, look. I'm gonna get some
stuff to make tea, okay? Okay.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.093
I'll be right back,
all right? Yeah.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.892
It's not working, Al.
What isn't working?

29:30.969 --> 29:33.028
The lobelia is not strong enough.

29:33.104 --> 29:36.505
He needs the pills. I'm gonna
go into town and get 'em.

29:36.574 --> 29:38.940
No, but if you go into town
that- that Luke is gonna find you.

29:39.010 --> 29:41.478
Yeah, well,
not if I find him first.

29:41.546 --> 29:44.538
Listen, uh, Roy.
I changed my mind.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.551
I'm gonna go into town
and get you those pills, okay?

29:47.619 --> 29:50.486
- And I think it'd be a real good idea if you came along with me.
- No!

29:50.555 --> 29:53.080
- What?
- I can't.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.626
- Not till I get a picture.
- A picture?

29:55.693 --> 29:59.527
Of Bigfoot.
That's the only reason I came up here.

29:59.597 --> 30:02.031
To prove that me and Dad
were telling the truth.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.592
Uh, Sam, I don't think it's a good idea
to leave Roy here alone.

30:05.670 --> 30:09.868
All right. But you two gotta promise me
that you'll stay put, all right?

30:09.941 --> 30:12.705
- You won't go anywhere. You got it?
- Got it.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.209
I understand that, Mrs. Jenkins.

30:20.285 --> 30:23.914
But I can't come up there every time
your cat eats one of your birds.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.149
I'm sure he was a very nice bird.

30:26.224 --> 30:29.557
Tell you what, why don't you-

30:33.198 --> 30:37.726
<i>- Mrs. Jenkins,
I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>

30:39.871 --> 30:42.169
Well-

30:42.240 --> 30:44.708
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

30:46.211 --> 30:48.941
- I think we should talk, Luke.
- Is that right?

30:51.216 --> 30:56.017
I know you've had a lot of things happen in
your life that you'd just as soon forget about.

30:56.087 --> 31:00.717
But they did happen,
and it seems to me like...

31:00.792 --> 31:03.556
now is probably a good time to...

31:03.628 --> 31:05.687
deal with it.

31:05.763 --> 31:08.596
Deal with it...
like you have?

31:09.968 --> 31:13.267
<i>Look at yourself, Henry.
Look at what you've become.</i>

31:13.338 --> 31:15.272
And what have you become, Luke?

31:22.413 --> 31:24.381
- What do you want?
- Roy's sick.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.948
If he doesn't get his medication,
he's gonna die.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.044
Wasn't too sick
to steal those chickens.

31:30.121 --> 31:33.887
This has nothing to do with
stealing chickens and you know it.

31:33.958 --> 31:36.688
Now, I know that things happened
over there- terrible things.

31:36.761 --> 31:40.959
But they're no excuse
for what you're doing right now.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.227
Now, I want your word as a friend...

31:43.301 --> 31:47.761
that if I bring Roy in for treatment
you will not take him into custody.

31:51.276 --> 31:53.267
What do you say?

31:58.383 --> 32:01.216
I say you're under arrest.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.984
I'm tellin you, he had me
right where he wanted me!

32:05.056 --> 32:09.516
<i>My shoulder just about to
touch the mat, and wham! Wham?</i>

32:09.594 --> 32:12.995
Yeah. I flipped him on his back,
and I pinned him. Crowd went crazy.

32:13.064 --> 32:16.864
Hurray! Hurray!

32:16.935 --> 32:21.167
And your daddy
taught me that move.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.935
Were you with him when he died?

32:25.009 --> 32:27.273
Uh-

32:28.346 --> 32:30.280
Uh, yeah.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.714
- Uh, I was with him.
- How'd it happen?

32:37.322 --> 32:39.347
Didn't Luke ever tell you?

32:39.424 --> 32:41.483
Well, he doesn't really like to talk
about the war.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.493
Oh.

32:45.129 --> 32:49.031
Oh, uh-
Do you think I could hold that camera?

32:49.100 --> 32:51.227
Yeah!
I could?

32:56.908 --> 33:01.641
So, um, did you really see
Bigfoot? Oh, yeah. I sure did.

33:01.713 --> 33:05.581
L- I was climbing down
that ridge over there.

33:05.650 --> 33:09.450
See?
Past the crooked pine.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.455
Jumped up on a rock
and there he was.

33:12.523 --> 33:16.152
He was looking right at me.
Were you afraid?

33:16.227 --> 33:18.388
No.

33:20.865 --> 33:25.199
You see, there was somethin'
about the way he looked at me.

33:26.871 --> 33:29.840
Like- Like he-

33:29.907 --> 33:32.102
he knew I wasn't there to hurt him.

33:32.176 --> 33:35.577
And then he just turned
and walked away.

33:37.081 --> 33:39.914
There was something about him.

33:39.984 --> 33:42.350
Something...

33:42.420 --> 33:44.581
peaceful.

33:44.655 --> 33:48.022
- Help me find him.
- What?

33:48.092 --> 33:51.493
- You're the only one that knows the truth.
- Oh.

33:51.562 --> 33:54.725
Oh, I don't know.
Uh, Henry told us not to move.

33:54.799 --> 33:58.200
Well, if I don't find some kind of proof,
Luke's gonna think I'm lying.

33:59.637 --> 34:02.697
I owe it to my father, don't I?

34:07.612 --> 34:12.072
You're making a big mistake. You made a
mistake when you decided to come back here.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.109
What are you gonna do now?

34:15.186 --> 34:18.849
I'm gonna find Roy,
and I'm gonna end this thing.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.425
Why couldn't you
just stayed up there?

34:31.402 --> 34:33.529
Oh, sorry, Sam.

34:33.603 --> 34:35.936
Eh, we got trouble, Sam. Oh,
no kidding, we've got trouble.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.272
Well, we've got even bigger trouble.
L- I just popped into the campsite...

34:39.342 --> 34:42.107
and Roy and Daniel are gone.
Gone where?

34:42.179 --> 34:45.581
Ah, well, Ziggy says they're on their way
to someplace called Willamette Peak.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.244
Well, how would Ziggy know that?
Ah, well, history's changed.

34:48.319 --> 34:52.152
There's a 97% chance that they're
both gonna get found tomorrow and-

34:52.223 --> 34:55.487
and when they get found
that they're dead.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.422
<i>What do you mean
they're both dead?</i>

35:02.500 --> 35:05.731
Danny slipped and took a fall
into a-a crevasse or something,

35:05.803 --> 35:08.397
and Roy was trying to help him,
but he had one of those seizures.

35:08.473 --> 35:10.839
You gotta get out there!
I'm open to suggestions.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.842
Okay?
Well, I don't know.

35:12.910 --> 35:16.004
You should just go up there
and keep an eye on 'em.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.139
You gotta get outta here!
I'll think of something.

35:18.216 --> 35:21.310
L- I-I-Just go on.
Go be with 'em.

35:23.754 --> 35:26.018
I'm open to suggestions.

35:26.090 --> 35:28.024
<i>Luke?</i>

35:28.092 --> 35:30.083
<i>Luke?</i>

35:30.161 --> 35:32.391
Thank you.
Back here!

35:35.800 --> 35:38.325
- Henry?
- Karen?

35:38.402 --> 35:42.065
- Where's Luke? Was Daniel with him?
- Daniel is with Roy.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.576
- Roy?
- Now, just take it easy, okay?

35:45.643 --> 35:48.840
Daniel wandered into our campsite
this morning.

35:48.913 --> 35:53.213
Now I think that he and Roy
are off looking for Bigfoot.

35:53.284 --> 35:56.515
Henry, Roy wouldn't do anything
to hurt Daniel, would he?

35:56.587 --> 35:58.885
No.
No, not intentionally, no.

36:00.691 --> 36:03.626
You know where they are. You
know where they are, don't you?

36:03.694 --> 36:08.063
Listen to me.
Roy's seizures are much worse,

36:08.132 --> 36:11.727
and if he doesn't get his medication,
he's gonna die.

36:13.304 --> 36:15.568
And if he does,
I think Daniel might too.

36:15.640 --> 36:19.007
What do you want?
I want you to get me his medication.

36:19.076 --> 36:21.806
Then I'll tell you anything you want.

36:21.879 --> 36:24.905
L- I'll- I'll take you there if you want.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.384
<i>Karen.</i>

36:28.452 --> 36:30.977
<i>Karen.!</i>

36:43.201 --> 36:47.194
<i>God, I feel like we were
walking straight up.</i>

36:47.271 --> 36:49.432
We have.

36:49.507 --> 36:51.634
So are we near the spot?

36:52.710 --> 36:55.270
We're right on top of it.

36:56.514 --> 36:59.449
So what do we do now?

36:59.517 --> 37:01.985
We wait.

37:07.024 --> 37:09.219
Oh, good. You're all right.

37:09.293 --> 37:12.057
Everybody just stay calm,
and we'll get out of here standing.

37:12.129 --> 37:14.563
My mom may
probably be mad at me now.

37:14.632 --> 37:18.762
- Why don't you tell him to go home?
- Sometimes a boy gotta break away from his mama.

37:18.836 --> 37:20.929
On second thought,
don't say anything.

37:21.005 --> 37:24.805
- Do you-you think he might be here?
- There's no way to tell.

37:24.875 --> 37:28.072
He could be a thousand miles away.

37:28.145 --> 37:30.136
Or he could be watching us right now.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.653
I hope that hairy devil
can't see holograms.

37:36.721 --> 37:40.122
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Of me?

37:40.191 --> 37:42.125
Sure!

37:58.209 --> 38:00.336
<i>Daniel!</i>

38:03.547 --> 38:07.347
Daniel! Where'd you go?

38:07.418 --> 38:10.785
<i>I gotta go down in there
and see what happened to him.</i>

38:20.831 --> 38:24.824
- Gooshie, center me on Sam!
- Daniel!

38:24.902 --> 38:27.564
Well, that was stupid!

38:27.638 --> 38:31.972
It wasn't your fault.
The buck came out of nowhere.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.807
At least
we didn't end up in the river.

38:34.879 --> 38:37.507
Sam, you gotta hurry up!
What's wrong?

38:37.581 --> 38:40.049
- Everything!
- Daniel's fallen down. He's stuck...

38:40.117 --> 38:43.382
- down in a crevasse, and Roy's really starting to lose it.
- Where are they?

38:43.454 --> 38:47.185
- Good question.
- Uh, they're over the ridge, back there.

38:47.258 --> 38:49.192
Come on. Come on!

38:50.294 --> 38:52.728
Just hang in there, kid.
Help is comin'.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.765
<i>Come on, Sam.
Daniel.!</i>

38:54.832 --> 38:58.165
Oh, over here, Sam!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

38:58.235 --> 39:01.261
Roy. Roy, here
are your pills. Uh-

39:01.339 --> 39:03.330
Here you go. Where's Daniel?
I don't-

39:03.407 --> 39:05.341
I don't know what happened,
Henry. Where is he?

39:05.409 --> 39:08.344
<i>He fell and he was gone.
Sam, he's down here.! Daniel!</i>

39:08.412 --> 39:11.438
<i>- Daniel.!
- He fell down, and he's stuck in there. I checked him out.</i>

39:11.515 --> 39:14.541
<i>- Daniel! Honey!
- He must've hit his head on a rock. He's out cold.</i>

39:14.618 --> 39:16.711
<i>We gotta get him outta here, Al.! Daniel.!</i>

39:16.787 --> 39:19.688
You're not gonna do anything.
Luke.

39:19.757 --> 39:23.022
Karen.
Come on up here.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.255
Luke, Daniel is hurt.

39:28.332 --> 39:31.631
<i>- What did he do to him?
- He didn't do anything to him.</i>

39:31.702 --> 39:34.865
He- He slipped
and he fell in this hole.

39:34.939 --> 39:37.840
Now, why don't you put the gun
down and give us a hand?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.571
Luke!

39:46.751 --> 39:48.946
Luke, John's death wasn't your fault.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.789
<i>It was a war.</i>

39:52.857 --> 39:55.291
Things happen in war.

39:58.362 --> 40:00.387
And I wanted to tell you.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.398
But...

40:02.466 --> 40:04.457
I just didn't know how.

40:04.535 --> 40:07.527
- It's all right.
- No, let me- let me finish.

40:09.507 --> 40:12.340
- It was my fault thatJohn died.
- Why?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.810
Because you couldn't kill an old man?

40:16.514 --> 40:19.074
You knew? But-

40:20.217 --> 40:23.414
- You didn't say anything.
- I said, "I do. "

40:23.487 --> 40:25.512
I figured that was enough.

40:27.224 --> 40:30.159
Please.

40:44.074 --> 40:46.941
- Can you see Daniel?
- No, it's too dark. I can't see anything.

40:47.011 --> 40:51.448
I've got a flashlight in my
pack. No. That's not the problem.

40:51.515 --> 40:54.245
This hole's too small
for any of us to get through.

41:09.733 --> 41:13.225
You take the pills?
Yeah.

41:14.705 --> 41:17.037
You feel any better yet?

41:19.810 --> 41:23.007
Look, Roy
- You want me to get in that hole, don't you?

41:24.882 --> 41:27.248
It's the only way
we're gonna save Daniel.

41:27.318 --> 41:30.549
You can do it, Roy.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.555
You can.

41:34.625 --> 41:37.389
<i>Push. Push. I got him.
Easy, easy.</i>

41:37.461 --> 41:40.726
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Bring him up.

41:42.032 --> 41:46.093
Okay, careful with his head.
Okay. Okay.

41:46.170 --> 41:51.107
Roy!

41:51.175 --> 41:53.541
You did it.

41:53.611 --> 41:57.138
I knew you would. Okay?
Uh-huh!

41:57.214 --> 41:59.205
Hey, Henry?
Yeah?

41:59.283 --> 42:01.581
I don't think I'm gonna see
them snakes no more.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.547
Come on.

42:06.991 --> 42:09.755
How is he? He's in shock,
but his vital signs are good.

42:09.827 --> 42:12.227
How near's the closest
hospital? Thirty miles. Damn it!

42:12.296 --> 42:15.595
What?
The truck is up on some rocks.

42:18.802 --> 42:22.761
<i>- I thought you said the truck was stuck.
- It was. I don't understand it.</i>

42:22.840 --> 42:26.298
Look, there's no time to figure
it out now. Come on! Okay.

42:27.978 --> 42:30.538
Open up the tailgate.
We'll put him in the back.

42:32.683 --> 42:34.878
Careful. Careful.

42:34.952 --> 42:38.115
You got him? Yeah.
Give him to me.

42:38.188 --> 42:40.679
Yeah. Got him. Okay.

42:40.758 --> 42:43.522
Watch his head, Karen.

42:43.594 --> 42:46.586
I don't know how to thank
you. How about, "Thank you"?

42:46.664 --> 42:50.225
Oh. Thanks.
Why don't you come with us, Roy?

42:50.301 --> 42:52.292
<i>Huh?
Let 'em check you out?</i>

42:52.369 --> 42:55.167
<i>It's okay, Sam. Ziggy says they'll be fine.</i>

42:55.239 --> 42:57.264
Go on. I'll be all right.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.512
You're welcome to
come with us. Uh,

43:02.580 --> 43:06.243
I'll, uh
- I'll catch up to you down there. I'm gonna walk down.

43:08.152 --> 43:11.610
Look, Henry.
Luke.

43:12.823 --> 43:14.757
It's okay.

43:15.993 --> 43:18.325
Get him to a hospital,
would ya? Yeah.

43:21.398 --> 43:23.332
Hey.
Huh?

43:23.400 --> 43:26.233
<i>Got your pills?
Oh, yeah.</i>

43:26.303 --> 43:28.464
All right. I'll see
ya in town. Okay.

43:32.943 --> 43:36.538
Well, Sam, Daniel isn't hurt bad.
He's okay.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.741
What about the others?

43:38.816 --> 43:41.580
Well, Luke and Karen go on
to have a couple kids,

43:41.652 --> 43:45.816
and Roy gets a job as a fire watcher
with the forest service.

43:45.889 --> 43:48.722
Great.
That's great. And Henry?

43:48.792 --> 43:51.784
Henry-
Oh, you're gonna like this.

43:51.862 --> 43:55.491
Henry takes that journal he's got,
and he turns it into a best-selling book.

43:55.566 --> 43:57.500
You're kidding me.
No.

43:59.670 --> 44:02.468
Well, that only leaves
one unanswered question then, Al.

44:04.341 --> 44:08.038
How did the truck get off the rocks
and back on the road and turned around?

44:08.112 --> 44:10.603
The truck-
Huh?

44:12.816 --> 44:14.841
I think I'm looking at it.
What are you talking about?

44:16.120 --> 44:18.384
I'm talking about... that!

44:28.232 --> 44:30.223
Oh, boy!

44:40.678 --> 44:42.771
<i>- Fire.!
- Fire.!</i>

44:47.951 --> 44:52.047
Oh, boy.
