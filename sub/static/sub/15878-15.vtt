WEBVTT

00:02.402 --> 00:03.926
[sighs]

00:04.003 --> 00:06.471
Jason and I just aren't happening.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.637
Maybe we're too much alike.

00:11.611 --> 00:16.776
My romantic ideal guy
is a rugged, spiritual adventurer

00:16.883 --> 00:19.408
who's intense and stoic,

00:19.486 --> 00:22.649
- but also really, really funny.
- Hmm.

00:22.756 --> 00:26.123
Shoulder-length hair, piercing eyes,

00:26.226 --> 00:29.684
Italian accent, rides a Vespa.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.027
Answers to the name Furio.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.668
Eww.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.932
Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I'm just
thinking about my ideal guy.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.432
I thought that was Dad.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.636
Sometimes I call him Daddy.

00:45.779 --> 00:51.547
Uh... Anyway, honey, I spent a long time
waiting for my perfect guy,

00:51.651 --> 00:55.417
until one day my mom told me
if I'd let go of the fantasy,

00:55.522 --> 00:57.183
someone real could come in

00:57.257 --> 00:59.521
and, in time, become
the man of my dreams.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.856
[Paul] Cate, I can't find my socks.

01:02.929 --> 01:04.396
And it happened.

01:05.265 --> 01:08.325
Mom, do you think I'll ever have
another boyfriend?

01:08.401 --> 01:12.667
Oh, honey, you just don't know
how beautiful you are, do you?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.673
- Stop it.
- Never.

01:16.209 --> 01:17.938
I'm gonna go get ready for work.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.905
- [sighs] Did you find them?
- Sock drawer.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.504
Incredible.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.550
Hey, Care Bear.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.385
What were you and your mother
talking about?

01:28.488 --> 01:30.581
- Nothing.
- You OK? Your face is puffy.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.319
- Dad!
- Not bad puffy.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.192
Oh, right, you mean the good puffy.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.298
- Look, Jason and I broke up.
- You broke up?

01:41.367 --> 01:44.530
Yeah, but I talked it out with Mom,
and I'm OK, OK?

01:44.637 --> 01:46.605
Sure. OK.

01:48.174 --> 01:52.304
You know, if you need another
perspective on this, I'm here.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.237
Your choice.

01:54.314 --> 01:57.374
Not prying. Did he dump you?

01:59.552 --> 02:01.213
No, it was mutual.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.653
Mutual? Get ready for a slew
of phone calls

02:03.756 --> 02:05.986
from him trying to get back together.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.788
He hasn't called.

02:07.861 --> 02:11.627
Give him a day. If you meant anything
at all to him, he'll come begging.

02:11.698 --> 02:14.826
[sniffles] We broke up last week!

02:16.336 --> 02:20.670
- Um... Hey...
- [sobbing, sniffling]

02:20.740 --> 02:22.605
You talked to Dad?

02:23.376 --> 02:25.105
What were you thinking?

02:25.178 --> 02:26.668
Paul!

02:26.746 --> 02:28.805
She just needed a good cry.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074

02:54.040 --> 02:57.100
[screams] Don't sneak up on people!
What are you doing?

02:57.177 --> 03:00.146
- I'm loving you, if you don't mind.
- Sorry, working.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.907
Me too.

03:01.981 --> 03:04.108
Hey, you know what I was
daydreaming about?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.151
Huh?

03:05.251 --> 03:07.549
Our dream vacation
we always talked about.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.919
You, me, Italy.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.550
Alone, just you and me.

03:14.594 --> 03:15.959
Or...

03:16.062 --> 03:18.997
...we rent a 40-foot RV,
load up the kids

03:19.065 --> 03:21.829
and visit all 30 of the
Major League Baseball parks.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.337
- Yeah!
- Hey!

03:28.942 --> 03:31.206
- Daddy, is this a good time?
- No, not really.

03:31.277 --> 03:34.838
I know you told me I couldn't go out
because my grades were slipping.

03:34.914 --> 03:38.645
Danielle's having this major party.
I have to go. Jenna will be there.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.176
She's moving in on my friends,
copying me. Now she's after Danielle,

03:42.255 --> 03:44.689
my fifth-best friend
since, like, forever.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.692
Bridge, you might want
to sit down for this.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.921
- OK.
- Um... No.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.020
[door opening]

03:51.965 --> 03:53.296
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.697
Wait a minute.

03:56.102 --> 03:59.230
Is that little Christina?
I haven't seen you...

03:59.305 --> 04:01.865
...since you and Kerry
were in the fifth grade.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.431
Hi.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.346
I haven't been over here
since your tenth birthday party

04:08.414 --> 04:10.279
with the Spice Girl impersonators.

04:10.350 --> 04:15.049
- It was fun. What was wrong with it?
- They were Spice Girl impersonators.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.648
Five middle-aged women with wigs...
who'd been drinking.

04:22.729 --> 04:26.392
- Yeah, it was a lame party, Dad.
- You said she'd like it.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.730
- Yeah.
- You...

04:28.801 --> 04:31.668
Listen, I have to go to that party
if Jenna's gonna be there.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.468
'Cause if she makes her move,
it's gonna be tonight.

04:34.540 --> 04:38.670
- Let's go upstairs.
- Wait. Please. I'm riveted.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.072
[scoffs]

04:44.317 --> 04:46.376
Mom, what are you doing?

04:46.452 --> 04:48.977
Oh, I just can't stand the mess anymore.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.546
I found pop bottles, candy wrappers,

04:51.624 --> 04:55.685
and under your bed,
books, clothes, and a tire.

04:56.696 --> 04:59.187
- That's gonna be part of my first car.
- Uh-huh.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.826
Honey, we need to talk.
You're on a tear.

05:01.901 --> 05:05.564
- What's with the cleaning frenzy?
- The kids keep this house so messy.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.572
It just makes me Furio...

05:07.640 --> 05:08.800
Furious.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.677
- I'll give you some privacy.
- What's in the box?

05:12.745 --> 05:14.679
- Nothing!
- Nothing? What's... Cate!

05:14.747 --> 05:16.578
Paul, it's just his secret box.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.810
I'm giving him his small measure
of privacy.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.943
That's the difference
between you and me.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.454
I want to know what's going on
in our kids' lives.

05:23.523 --> 05:26.048
I bet you don't know
who Kerry is with right now.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.649
- Christina.
- Christi...

05:27.727 --> 05:30.491
- You don't know what room she's in?
- Basement.

05:32.165 --> 05:36.499
- Why'd you even come up here?
- Do you even remember Christina?

05:36.569 --> 05:39.265
Oh, yeah. She was one of the friends
Kerry cut loose

05:39.339 --> 05:41.364
after your Spice Girls disaster.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.375
It wasn't that bad.

05:43.443 --> 05:46.276
Hey, I'm the one who had
to take their keys

05:46.346 --> 05:48.906
and drive them home in the Spicemobile.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.410
And that Baby Spice? Mean drunk.

05:53.753 --> 05:57.689
Since then Christina has grown
into a walking cloud of gloom.

05:57.757 --> 06:02.285
I remember her as just such a happy
little girl on the playground, smoking.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.455
I'm just afraid that since
her breakup with Jason

06:05.565 --> 06:09.501
Kerry will move to the dark side...
Or, well, further toward the dark side.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.168
OK, Paul, sit down.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.502
You are my husband,
and I say this with love...

06:16.576 --> 06:19.704
[shouting] Do not get involved!

06:22.148 --> 06:23.274
Bridget, I've decided

06:23.349 --> 06:25.214
- to let you go to the party...
- Daddy!

06:25.284 --> 06:27.184
...but I drop you off
and pick you up.

06:27.253 --> 06:30.814
- Around the corner, without talk radio.
- Fine. I'll be there at midnight.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.221
- Ish.
- You have to take your sister.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.226
- Never gonna happen.
- Deal breaker.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.194
- That's blackmail.
- It's bartering.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.231
I do something,
you do something for me.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.890
I don't wanna go with my sister.

06:40.967 --> 06:44.130
They'll call me "girl that goes
to parties with little sister."

06:44.203 --> 06:46.671
Could call you "girl who
stays home Saturday night

06:46.739 --> 06:49.503
while Jenna and Danielle
became fourth-best friends."

06:50.143 --> 06:51.872
Didn't want to have to say that.

06:53.613 --> 06:56.104
Why do you want Kerry
to go to Danielle's party?

06:56.182 --> 06:58.412
I want her to expand her horizons.

06:58.484 --> 07:02.215
There'll be a wider range of kids there
than the one she's zeroed in on.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.848
So my friends would be
a good influence on her?

07:04.957 --> 07:06.925
No! Well, yeah, kind of.

07:07.026 --> 07:09.995
It's like when a prisoner
has a matching kidney.

07:11.297 --> 07:12.264
OK, bartering.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.799
I could use $40 for a new top
for tonight.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.495
- Forty dollars? I'm not paying you.
- OK, fine.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.166
What about 20?

07:22.275 --> 07:25.108
[rock music playing]

07:32.718 --> 07:34.549
Bridget!

07:34.620 --> 07:36.554
Jenna! [fake laughter]

07:41.227 --> 07:44.390
[sighs] OK, remind me, why am I here?

07:44.497 --> 07:47.159
Well, you're hurting
and you're my baby sister.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.167
I want you to know I'm here for you.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.396
- Danielle! Hi!
- [Danielle] Bridget!

07:52.505 --> 07:55.065
Oh, wow, who are they?

07:55.174 --> 07:57.665
My brother and his friends from college.

07:57.743 --> 08:00.769
College boys? They look like they do
in the magazines.

08:01.547 --> 08:05.677
Excuse me, but isn't that Kyle,
your boyfriend, over there?

08:05.751 --> 08:08.015
See? You do know somebody.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.117
OK, for the next five minutes
I'm in college.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.353
Hey, Kerry. What are you doing here?

08:18.097 --> 08:19.655
I'm with Bridget.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.497
Yeah, me too.

08:26.372 --> 08:29.341
- Why do you put up with her?
- Same reason you do.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.840
Well, I put up with her
'cause she's my sister.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.380
Right. Has nothing to do
with how hot she is.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.486
So, you read any good books lately?

08:41.587 --> 08:43.611
Rule of the Bone by Russell Banks.

08:43.688 --> 08:46.385
- Really?
- I know! I get that a lot.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.522
- Hi, Kyle.
- Hey, Jenna.

08:51.130 --> 08:54.293
You know, Kyle, I admire you.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.063
The fact that you can stay
with a stuck-up princess

08:57.136 --> 08:58.797
who totally waxes her upper lip

08:58.871 --> 09:02.329
and isn't happy unless she's
the center of attention... Bridget.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.569
Jenna, her sister.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.545
Oh... I'm totally sorry.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.376
[Kerry] No, please, go on.

09:09.448 --> 09:13.077
Who's superficial, self-centered,
narcissistic, full of herself,

09:13.152 --> 09:15.620
like, "Hi, I'm God's gift
to the entire planet..."

09:15.688 --> 09:17.019
...fashion disaster,

09:17.089 --> 09:20.058
thinks she's cutting edge
'cause she knows who Moby is...

09:20.159 --> 09:21.490
Bridget!

09:22.895 --> 09:25.455
Oh, my God, I can't stand this party.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.524
It's not so bad. See?
Bridget's having a good time.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.704
- You want to go dance?
- Yeah.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.704
[rock music playing]

09:45.017 --> 09:47.986
[both chuckling]

09:49.589 --> 09:52.854
- You're a good dancer.
- Yeah, you too, for the '80s.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.187
Hey!

09:54.927 --> 09:58.590
It's funny, I've known you all this time
and don't really know you.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.132
Yeah. I never knew you liked to read.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.758
I never knew you could read.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.368
Hey, you know, thanks
for keeping me company.

10:07.473 --> 10:08.838
Ah, no problem.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.220
- Oh, man!
- That did not happen.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.056
Didn't happen! I'm sorry, sorry.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.288
- Did you think Bridget saw?
- Oh, my God!

10:34.200 --> 10:36.930
No, I think we're good.
How did that happen?

10:37.003 --> 10:38.265
I don't know. Let's see.

10:38.337 --> 10:42.103
We were talking, then you hugged me,
your hair smelled good, then...

10:43.676 --> 10:46.042
- Kyle!
- That did not happen!

10:46.145 --> 10:47.476
[doorbell rings]

10:49.448 --> 10:51.109
Yo, Mr. Hennessy.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.151
Oh, God, Anthony,
you were invited?

10:53.252 --> 10:56.380
Invited? Yo, this my crib, dawg.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.582
Danielle be my sib-lang.

10:58.658 --> 11:02.185
Look at you, all bundled up
like some kind of pig in a blanket,

11:02.261 --> 11:04.627
making me all hungry and whatnot. Shoot.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.223
Where's Bridget and Kerry?

11:07.333 --> 11:10.860
Oh, Boo One, Boo Two,
they be around here somewheres

11:10.936 --> 11:13.370
shakin' they barump-a-bump-bumps.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.601
Mom? You promised you'd stay upstairs.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.975
Dad, you can't be here, inside.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.378
I know, it ain't cool.

11:22.448 --> 11:27.112
I be out in my rig for over 20 minutes
just a-honkin' and a honk-a-lackin'.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.313
And I will continue talking this way...

11:29.388 --> 11:32.414
OK, Dad, we got it!
Jeez, we're leaving. Relax.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.126
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.500
Mom, do we have to?

11:44.570 --> 11:46.538
I don't want to hear any complaining.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.574
The least you girls can do
is put away your own laundry.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.804
What's her problem?
What's your problem?

11:53.879 --> 11:56.211
Do you think I'm blind?
I saw you with...

11:56.282 --> 11:58.443
- Oh, my God!
- Jenna.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.883
How can you be friends with her?

12:00.953 --> 12:04.116
Friends with Jenna... Yes, I am.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.817
I am friends with her.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.449
Excuse me, this is my shirt.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.221
No, it is my shirt.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.796
- You ripped my shirt!
- You ripped my shirt!

12:16.268 --> 12:18.236
Done. Finally.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.940
Hey, honey, I was thinking, um,

12:22.007 --> 12:25.568
why don't we have a nice dinner tonight
and... turn in early?

12:25.678 --> 12:27.202
Good idea. I'm beat.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.447
- [Bridget and Kerry screaming]
- [thudding]

12:35.121 --> 12:37.089
[stammering, sighing]

12:38.290 --> 12:40.155
[both continue screaming]

12:40.226 --> 12:42.694
- Hair, hair, hair!
- OK, sorry, I'm sorry.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.528
[screams] Get off of me!
You shouldn't be sitting on me!

12:46.632 --> 12:48.532
- You should thank me!
- For what?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.661
- For taking you to the party!
- Abandoning me at the party.

12:51.737 --> 12:54.570
If you didn't want me there
you shouldn't have invited me.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.905
The only reason you were was
because Dad paid me to take you.

12:59.845 --> 13:00.937
What?

13:02.848 --> 13:05.112
Oh, words, words, come back, words.

13:05.918 --> 13:09.081
Kerry, I am so, so sorry. [sighs]

13:10.456 --> 13:12.754
- He paid you?
- Oh, God, I am such a bad person.

13:12.825 --> 13:16.124
I told you something you weren't
supposed to hear and it hurt you.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.755
- Tell me something that will hurt me.
- I can't.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.459
I'm not letting you go until we're even.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.127
- OK.
- OK.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.308
Your eyebrows don't match.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.146
[sobbing] OK, we're even.

13:46.225 --> 13:50.685
Cate, aren't you even curious
about what's inside Rory's box?

13:50.763 --> 13:54.324
Of course I am. But I'm choosing
to take a high road here

13:54.433 --> 13:57.493
and respect the personal boundaries
of our children.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.130
I respect our children's
personal boundaries.

14:00.206 --> 14:03.835
I can't believe you paid Bridget
to take me to that stupid party!

14:03.909 --> 14:04.967
You did what?

14:05.044 --> 14:07.604
Don't listen to her.
She's talking in riddles.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.604
You know, Paul, when I said
"do not get involved,"

14:10.683 --> 14:12.310
it meant don't do, you know, this.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.682
- I'm going to Christina's.
- Don't go to...

14:14.753 --> 14:15.981
Paul, Paul!

14:16.055 --> 14:19.582
Now look, I've been married to you
for 20 years

14:19.658 --> 14:22.024
and I am fond of you.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.956
But I have to ask, are you insane?

14:27.032 --> 14:29.967
If loving my children is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

14:31.070 --> 14:34.506
No, no, no. You're not gonna Motown
your way out of it this time.

14:34.573 --> 14:35.801
Uh-uh.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.140
When are you gonna get it?
You cannot fix everything.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.975
I'm a man. Men fix things.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.446
We can't help ourselves.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.915
When the sink backs up
what do I do?

14:45.985 --> 14:47.816
You call a man to fix it.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.821
That's right, Cate, a man.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.428
Do you want to watch TV
or listen to music or something?

15:04.103 --> 15:06.867
- No.
- You're no fun.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.998
- Sorry.
- No, I like it.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.379
[woman] Christina,
Kerry's father is here.

15:14.446 --> 15:17.210
Oh, my God. [sighs]

15:17.316 --> 15:18.647
Hi, Kerry.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.878
Hi, Christina.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.251
Nice room.

15:28.827 --> 15:31.853
Kerry, I'm just gonna,
you know, go upstairs,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.899
so I don't have to be uncomfortable.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.995
More uncomfortable.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.004
Kerry, honey, I'm sorry.

15:45.077 --> 15:49.639
I just wanted you to recover
from the Jason thing a little too fast,

15:49.748 --> 15:54.117
- so I got Bridget to help out a little.
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

15:54.219 --> 15:55.584
No, no. I'm...

15:55.688 --> 15:57.849
...actually not sure you are.

15:59.158 --> 16:03.026
For your information, Christina's
got, like, a four-point-million GPA,

16:03.095 --> 16:06.223
and can get early admission
to any lvy League school.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.766
- How early?
- Dad!

16:08.834 --> 16:10.392
Sorry.

16:10.502 --> 16:13.266
I don't care how smart Christina is.

16:13.372 --> 16:16.933
You and she are too young to have
such a negative worldview.

16:17.009 --> 16:21.105
- Why can't you love me for who I am?
- I do, honey.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.240
- I don't know who that is.
- Yeah?

16:27.086 --> 16:28.610
Well, me neither.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.018
Bear.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.783
No, no, you're right.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.852
I don't fit in with Christina's group.

16:37.796 --> 16:40.060
I don't fit in with Bridget's group.

16:41.734 --> 16:45.795
Jason and I aren't gonna happen
and I just... I feel so...

16:47.139 --> 16:49.607
...so mixed up all the time.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.041
Well, honey, you...

16:52.111 --> 16:54.944
You should tell these things
to your mother and me.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.848
I talk to Mom a lot, but...
today she was busy cleaning

16:58.917 --> 17:02.944
- and talking about Vespas and Italy.
- Oh.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.082
Ohh...

17:06.025 --> 17:07.549
[groans] Oh.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.425
Well, you can tell me anything.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.192
It'll just be between us.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.761
- Anything?
- Yeah.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.795
I don't know, it's pretty bad.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.373
Honey, I'm not here to judge.
I just... How bad?

17:22.441 --> 17:24.409
No, you just tell me. Go ahead.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.840
Make it fast.

17:26.912 --> 17:28.242
Kyle and I kissed.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.439
You did?

17:31.517 --> 17:33.280
Are you OK?

17:33.919 --> 17:36.251
I don't know, Dad.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.453
It's just more confusion, you know.

17:43.328 --> 17:46.092
- Dad?
- Huh? Sorry.

17:46.198 --> 17:49.099
I'm just still mentally
burying his body.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.379
Kyle, why are you looking at me funny?

18:03.482 --> 18:04.744
I'm not, I swear.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.387
Yes, you are. I know what it's about.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.013
You do?

18:11.123 --> 18:13.284
It's my eyebrows, isn't it?

18:20.899 --> 18:22.366
Oh, hi.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.630
I'm gonna go upstairs.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.736
You know!

18:39.451 --> 18:43.410
[Cate] Rory Joseph Hennessy, let go!

18:43.522 --> 18:45.183
[Rory] You let go!

18:47.392 --> 18:50.054
- No!
- What is in the damn box?

18:51.897 --> 18:53.558
Cate, honey, come here, stop.

18:53.632 --> 18:57.864
Look, I've been cleaning around it
for three days. It's driving me nuts!

19:00.038 --> 19:01.403
[taunting] Aah!

19:03.675 --> 19:06.007
- Key, key, key! Come on.
- Easy!

19:06.078 --> 19:07.807
- Easy.
- Move it.

19:10.282 --> 19:11.806
OK, OK.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.522
Oh, Paul, it...

19:17.623 --> 19:21.684
It's a picture of me holding Rory
when he was a baby.

19:24.496 --> 19:28.364
These are newspaper clippings of
when I was a sportswriter, my columns.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.993
- You kept these?
- Yeah.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.032
All of 'em.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.471
Why didn't you just tell us?

19:35.541 --> 19:40.376
I didn't want anybody to think
I was... corny, OK?

19:41.380 --> 19:43.143
I think I need some alone time.

19:43.215 --> 19:44.580
Oh... Yeah...

19:44.650 --> 19:46.208
- OK, honey.
- Sure.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.877
Look, I'm sorry.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.421
I forgive you.

19:58.997 --> 20:00.328
Yeah, Dad.

20:01.066 --> 20:03.034
I kept your clippings...

20:03.869 --> 20:06.337
...on top of my false bottom

20:06.405 --> 20:09.533
to hide my fireworks.

20:10.576 --> 20:12.942
- All right, hand them over.
- Let's go, Rory.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.479
You think we're that stupid?
Give me that box.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.813
Oh, Paul, look at this.
It's like an ammo dump in here.

20:20.819 --> 20:24.346
Ugh! You are right. We can have
no secrets in this family.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.687
Speaking of secrets, hey,

20:26.758 --> 20:28.521
I'm ready to go to Italy.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.196
Just you, me, alone.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.854
[speaks Italian]

20:35.300 --> 20:38.394
But you know, the Italy upstairs,
not the real Italy.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.437
Oh, yeah. OK.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.006
[Bridget screams]
I'm gonna kill you!

20:42.074 --> 20:43.564
What is going on?

20:43.642 --> 20:46.805
I talked to Amanda, who talked
to Michelle, who talked to Walker,

20:46.912 --> 20:50.473
- who dates Josie, that you...
- Kyle kissing Kerry meant nothing.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.947
...borrowed my sweater!

20:57.256 --> 21:00.817
- What?
- You borrowed her sweater?!

21:01.305 --> 21:07.266
