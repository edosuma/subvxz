I think the fact that
you're wearing
a weird tiny hat

00:56.727 --> 00:58.229
tells me you never
got the gum out.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.352

04:21.472 --> 04:23.554
Did I just tell Xander
he means everything to me,

04:23.554 --> 04:25.516
and he high-fived me?

04:25.516 --> 04:27.558
Yup. If you had
a problem with it,

04:27.558 --> 04:28.849
you should have
left him hangin'.

04:32.443 --> 04:34.525
Thanks for helping out

05:05.476 --> 05:07.888

the Korean alphabet?

05:09.640 --> 05:11.602
Hey, since I never
get any letters,

05:11.602 --> 05:14.274
can I go do anything else?

05:14.274 --> 05:18.278
Hey, here's
something for you,

05:18.278 --> 05:20.030
Mr. "Current Resident."

05:21.321 --> 05:22.573
Here you go, Ravi.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.496

see over the golf cart

05:25.906 --> 05:27.157
Score!

05:29.079 --> 05:31.121
Ow, I feel terrible
for Griff.

05:31.121 --> 05:32.663
He never gets any mail.

05:32.663 --> 05:34.665
I never get
any mail either.

05:34.665 --> 05:37.418
But you're a CIT.
You should be
able to handle it.

05:37.418 --> 05:38.589
(VOICE BREAKING)
Right. I can handle it.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.803
Hey, maybe if we
write Griff a letter

05:42.803 --> 05:45.225
from a mystery pen pal,
it'll cheer him up.

05:45.225 --> 05:46.637
Great idea!

05:46.637 --> 05:49.390
And we could pretend
to be a camper from
Camp Champion,

05:49.390 --> 05:51.141
who spotted him
from across the lake.

05:51.141 --> 05:53.353
I like it.
We'll get started
right after mail call.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.856
Wait!

05:55.856 --> 05:57.608
How about you read
one from my bag?

05:57.608 --> 05:58.859
Okay.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.982
Bo Bell.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.193
Seriously?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.039
Duh. I'm such an idiot!

06:09.039 --> 06:10.621
No argument here.

06:11.251 --> 06:12.583
What are we talking about?

06:13.584 --> 06:15.626
Oh, I totally choked
and said "thanks,"

06:15.626 --> 06:18.048
when Emma told me that
I meant everything to her.

06:18.048 --> 06:20.671
Oh, then you are an idiot.

06:20.671 --> 06:23.764
That's pretty big talk
from a guy wearing
such a small hat.

06:23.764 --> 06:24.965
I just hope Emma
and I can get through

06:24.965 --> 06:26.717
this canoeing class
without it being too awkward.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.853
Hey, Emma.
Mr. McCormick.

06:34.565 --> 06:35.606
Awkward!

06:36.607 --> 06:38.689
I think Emma's
mad at Xander.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.571
I also think
these little hats

06:40.571 --> 06:41.692
are really working
for me.

06:42.863 --> 06:44.695
You got one of
those things right.

06:46.787 --> 06:48.408
Okay, campers,
before we get you

06:48.408 --> 06:49.830
out on the water,
we have a few tips.

06:49.830 --> 06:51.662
First tip, while canoeing,

06:51.662 --> 06:53.914
always remember to
appreciate your partner.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.836
She's really putting
herself out there,

06:55.836 --> 06:58.378
and deserves to know
how you feel.

06:58.378 --> 07:00.801
Well, you also don't want
a canoeing partner

07:00.801 --> 07:01.962
who puts a bunch of
pressure on you

07:01.962 --> 07:04.545
when you just want
a relaxing summer boat trip.

07:04.545 --> 07:06.887
Summer?
Just a summer boat trip?

07:06.887 --> 07:09.389
What, do you have
a different canoeing
partner for every season?

07:09.389 --> 07:10.761
(GIGGLES)

07:10.761 --> 07:14.855
Look, Xander's sweating
through his life vest.

07:14.855 --> 07:18.018
Emma, can we please not
chat about this right now
in front of all the...

07:18.689 --> 07:20.360
The fish?

07:20.360 --> 07:23.063
Oh, don't worry,
you and I won't be
"chatting" ever again.

07:26.617 --> 07:29.409
So, does this mean
Emma's available?

07:29.409 --> 07:30.741
Keep dreamin', hat boy.

07:34.374 --> 07:38.418
"Yevstigneyev,"
then an upside down "H,"

07:38.418 --> 07:40.420
and what looks like
a picture of a crown.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.636
And "Griff Jones."

07:45.636 --> 07:47.798
Wha... Really?

07:47.798 --> 07:49.590
For me?

07:49.590 --> 07:51.722
How does it feel
to get mail?

07:51.722 --> 07:53.473
No, seriously,
how does it feel?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.685
Because I would not know.

07:56.557 --> 07:58.729
It's from a girl
at Camp Champion,

07:58.729 --> 07:59.940
who saw me
swimming in the lake.

08:00.811 --> 08:02.022
Her name is Erin.

08:02.022 --> 08:05.065
A name with Gaelic origins,

08:05.065 --> 08:06.446
much like the name Griff.
(LAUGHS)

08:06.446 --> 08:08.819
What a totally random
etymological co-winky-dink.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.823
And it says she spent
time in juvie, too!

08:12.823 --> 08:14.414
What are the odds?

08:14.414 --> 08:17.417
And look at that
lovely handwriting!

08:17.417 --> 08:20.921
She must have taken
an after-school
calligraphy class.

08:20.921 --> 08:24.545
I'm going to write her back
and tell her a little bit
about myself.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.886
Good idea.
And when you're done,

08:25.886 --> 08:27.297
give it to Ravi
to mail for you.

08:27.297 --> 08:28.889
He's got a bunch of
stamps lyin' around.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.341
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:31.341 --> 08:33.844
Those stamps
are collector's items.

08:33.844 --> 08:38.769
My Vermin of Canada series
just made the "Hot List,"
in  Philatelist Monthly.

08:38.769 --> 08:39.940
Since you're not
mailin' it,

08:39.940 --> 08:41.441
you don't have to
actually use a stamp.

08:41.441 --> 08:43.063
Just read it
and write back.

08:43.814 --> 08:44.905
Right.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.987
So, Griff...

08:46.987 --> 08:48.739
When you are ready,
give me that letter

08:48.739 --> 08:51.111
and I will slap on a
Saskatoon ground squirrel.

08:51.111 --> 08:52.152
(CHUCKLES)

08:54.825 --> 08:56.536
Hey, Xander,
great news!

08:56.536 --> 08:57.788
Emma calmed down?

08:57.788 --> 09:02.212
(LAUGHS) Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

09:02.212 --> 09:04.835
The news is, we're
going to make a fortune

09:04.835 --> 09:07.718
once your next song
blows up on my ChatSnap.

09:07.718 --> 09:11.011
I ordered 10,000 rolls
of Xander toilet paper.

09:11.011 --> 09:12.472
Why would you do that?

09:12.472 --> 09:14.675
Because everyone
likes celebrities,

09:14.675 --> 09:16.847
and everyone uses
toilet paper.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.059
I myself use a
two-ply Kenny Chesney.

09:21.231 --> 09:22.773
I'm sorry, Zuri,
but I just have

09:22.773 --> 09:24.855
too much on my mind
to sing right now.

09:24.855 --> 09:29.149
I understand,
and your feelings
are important to me.

09:29.149 --> 09:30.741
Tell me what's going on.

09:30.741 --> 09:32.452
It's just that...

09:32.452 --> 09:35.115
I don't come from a family
that talks about
their emotions.

09:35.115 --> 09:36.867
My dad's a football guy.

09:36.867 --> 09:37.958
The way he tells me
he loves me

09:37.958 --> 09:39.960
is by slapping me
on the butt.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.913
Well, don't try that
with Emma.

09:42.913 --> 09:44.504
The truth is, I do
want to tell Emma...
(STATIC BUZZ)

09:44.504 --> 09:45.666
...how I feel,
but I just...

09:51.712 --> 09:54.174
Uh, Zuri,
what are you doing?

09:54.174 --> 09:55.716
Recording this.

09:55.716 --> 09:58.849
Now, pour your heart out,
and make it rhyme.

10:00.520 --> 10:01.932
Look, I don't
want to be rude,

10:01.932 --> 10:03.774
but I'm just not
in the mood.

10:03.774 --> 10:07.107
Yes, that's gold.
I didn't mean to rhyme!

10:07.107 --> 10:11.071
I'm gonna need a lot more
than two bars to sell
all this toilet paper.

10:12.322 --> 10:13.734
Zuri!

10:13.734 --> 10:14.905
Can you explain
why there's a charge

10:14.905 --> 10:16.076
for thousands of
dollars worth of

10:16.076 --> 10:17.788
toilet paper
on my credit card?

10:17.788 --> 10:18.869
Nope.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.799
Hey, guys, would you mail
this letter to Erin for me?

10:28.799 --> 10:29.840
Sure.
Happy to.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.171
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, and Ravi,

10:31.171 --> 10:32.592
since you weren't around,
I went ahead

10:32.592 --> 10:34.464
and slapped on one of
your weird stamps.

10:35.305 --> 10:37.217
Oh, look at that.

10:38.598 --> 10:40.851
It is the Nova Scotian
bog lemming.

10:40.851 --> 10:43.854
What a wonderful use of
a rare $5,000 stamp.

10:46.266 --> 10:48.028
Griff, you're going to
love having a pen pal.

10:48.028 --> 10:51.031
I have a few pals I've been
exchanging letters with
for years.

10:51.031 --> 10:52.823
Let me guess,
they're all farm animals?

10:52.823 --> 10:54.574
Not all. One's a donkey,

10:54.574 --> 10:56.616
which is really more
of a ranch animal.

10:57.617 --> 10:59.449
If you say so.

10:59.449 --> 11:00.911
Oh, I wonder what he wrote.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.542
Oh, Lou, please
be careful with

11:02.542 --> 11:03.914
my stamp
when you open...

11:03.914 --> 11:05.335
No! My bog lemming!

11:06.626 --> 11:09.089
Uh-oh, this is bad.

11:09.089 --> 11:10.420
Tell me about it.

11:10.420 --> 11:14.054
A Canadian Vermin Series
without a bog lemming

11:14.054 --> 11:15.926
is like an engagement ring
without a diamond.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.558
Forget about
your stupid stamp.

11:18.558 --> 11:20.260
Griff wrote Erin
about a store in town

11:20.260 --> 11:22.803
that locks up their
dirt bikes with
a flimsy chain.

11:22.803 --> 11:24.184
He said he wants to
steal one.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.936
Oh, no!

11:25.936 --> 11:28.018
I hope he mentioned something
about stealing a helmet.

11:30.070 --> 11:32.943
If he steals anything,
he'll be sent back to juvie.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.154
We have to stop him!

11:34.154 --> 11:36.156
But Griff only told
this to Erin.

11:36.156 --> 11:39.619
If we confront him,
he will know we were
tricking him.

11:39.619 --> 11:42.412
You're right.
He'll never trust us again.

11:42.412 --> 11:45.746
So, we need to write him
another letter from Erin

11:45.746 --> 11:47.167
trying to talk
sense into him.

11:47.167 --> 11:48.538
You know, felon to felon.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.042
Or, Erin could say
she'll go to the police.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.174
Absolutely not!

11:54.174 --> 11:55.886
Erin is no snitch!

11:55.886 --> 11:57.427
She lives by the
code of the streets.

11:57.427 --> 12:00.600
"If the fuzz asks
you to drop a dime,
be as silent as a mime."

12:08.899 --> 12:11.401
Emma?
Xander?

12:11.401 --> 12:13.023
What are you doing here?

12:13.023 --> 12:15.906
Looking for a place
as cold as your heart?

12:15.906 --> 12:19.119
No. Zuri wanted me to get
hamburger patties for
the cookout later.

12:19.119 --> 12:20.951
She wanted me to do
the same thing.

12:20.951 --> 12:22.863
That's strange.

12:22.863 --> 12:25.996
Although, it's not as strange
as this box labeled
"otter nuggets."

12:28.248 --> 12:29.870
Hey! (RATTLES)

12:29.870 --> 12:31.461
Hey, what's going on?

12:31.461 --> 12:33.003
Obviously, we're trapped,

12:33.003 --> 12:35.085
just like your emotions.

12:35.085 --> 12:38.588
We're not opening this door
until you two make up,

12:38.588 --> 12:40.090
and I get my song!

12:40.090 --> 12:43.053
And I get $50 million!

12:43.053 --> 12:44.014
What?

12:44.014 --> 12:46.186
I'm not sitting
on this crate
for nothin'.

12:50.190 --> 12:51.311
Hey, Griff,

12:51.311 --> 12:52.602
you got another
letter from Erin!

12:52.602 --> 12:53.984
And because
she's a criminal,

12:53.984 --> 12:56.316
she made her O's
look like little handcuffs.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.199
Where is he?

12:59.199 --> 13:01.741
Look, Griff left
a letter on his bed.

13:01.741 --> 13:04.454
Great, Griff used
another one of my stamps.

13:04.454 --> 13:08.038
This time, please
be careful not to rip...
(PAPER RIPS)

13:08.038 --> 13:11.251
And goodbye, Cornwallis
Island Tundra shrew!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.084
Oh, no.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.045
Griff wrote Erin
that he's going to

13:15.045 --> 13:16.967
canoe into town
to steal that dirt bike.

13:16.967 --> 13:19.049
(GASPS) Oh,
this is terrible!

13:19.049 --> 13:21.381
Still no mention
of swiping a helmet?

13:22.552 --> 13:23.844
We have to get to
the dock

13:23.844 --> 13:25.135
and stop him
before he leaves.

13:29.189 --> 13:31.351
Ha-ha-ha!
Suckas!

13:31.351 --> 13:33.143
(HISSES AND GROANS)

13:34.064 --> 13:36.066
Yeah, that's right,
Mrs. Kipling,

13:36.066 --> 13:37.697
I'm pranking your master.

13:38.778 --> 13:41.441
And now I'm
talking to a lizard.

13:41.441 --> 13:43.283
Maybe that's why
I don't get any mail.

13:43.283 --> 13:44.404
(MRS. KIPLING GROANS)

13:45.535 --> 13:46.907
Oh, great, Xander.

13:46.907 --> 13:48.118
Because you're dead
on the inside,

13:48.118 --> 13:50.000
we're both going to be
dead on the outside!

13:51.041 --> 13:52.582
Don't be ridiculous. Okay?

13:52.582 --> 13:54.714
Zuri is not going to
endanger her own sister.

13:54.714 --> 13:55.916
Yes, I would!

13:55.916 --> 13:57.337
I want that video!

13:57.337 --> 13:58.959
And I want my money!

14:00.670 --> 14:02.342
It's freezing!

14:02.342 --> 14:03.964
Oh, thank goodness
someone left some
mittens in here.

14:05.015 --> 14:07.057
Uh, Emma,
I wouldn't do that.

14:07.057 --> 14:08.848
Oh, why?
Because if I put them on,

14:08.848 --> 14:10.020
it'll be harder
for you to give me

14:10.020 --> 14:11.771
one of your warm
and caring high-fives?

14:14.354 --> 14:17.027
No, because
those aren't mittens.
They're dead rats.

14:17.027 --> 14:18.398
Ew, gross!

14:20.190 --> 14:22.652
Ugh, this is the
worst day ever.

14:22.652 --> 14:24.824
Just admit it,
you don't care about me.

14:24.824 --> 14:26.786
I'm not your everything!
That's not true!

14:26.786 --> 14:27.908
Then just say it!

14:27.908 --> 14:29.579
Fine! Fine!
You're my everything!

14:29.579 --> 14:30.700
There, happy?

14:32.792 --> 14:33.914
Your plan worked!

14:33.914 --> 14:35.916
I heard Xander say
they're happy.

14:35.916 --> 14:40.050
Yes! Time to order 5,000
Xander bobble heads!

14:40.050 --> 14:41.301
Hopefully,
no one will notice

14:41.301 --> 14:42.552
he's wearing
a Mets uniform.

14:43.263 --> 14:44.464
Or that he's Dominican.

14:47.097 --> 14:50.060
All right, Xander, time to
shoot that music video!

14:50.060 --> 14:54.144
Uh, you don't by any chance
have a Mets uniform, do you?

14:54.144 --> 14:56.776
Zuri, your stupid plan
just made things worse!

14:56.776 --> 14:59.359
I'll say! I almost
just wore rat mittens!

14:59.359 --> 15:00.610
Ugh.

15:02.022 --> 15:03.863
All right, forget Emma.

15:03.863 --> 15:07.117
Concentrate on your music,
and blowing up my ChatSnap.

15:07.117 --> 15:10.030
No! I don't care
about your ChatSnap.

15:10.030 --> 15:11.661
My whole relationship
is blown up!

15:14.164 --> 15:16.206
Oh, man.
This is horrible.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.297
Tell me about it.

15:17.297 --> 15:20.170
These burgers were
rejected by a local kennel.

15:21.301 --> 15:24.094
Wait, no, they're
from a local kennel.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.105
Oh, no, we're too late!
Griff's not here!

15:35.105 --> 15:36.556
Uh, perhaps if we
hop in a canoe,

15:36.556 --> 15:37.727
we can catch up to him!

15:37.727 --> 15:38.938
Not with you rowing.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.561
Hey, guys.

15:41.561 --> 15:43.863
I was just gonna go
for a canoe ride.

15:43.863 --> 15:46.776
A-ha! I knew it!
Knew what?

15:46.776 --> 15:49.119
We know...
We can't tell him
we're Erin.

15:49.119 --> 15:50.410
Nothing.
We know nothing.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.283
Uh, Griff,

15:53.283 --> 15:57.207
why do you need a ski mask
and gloves to go canoeing?

15:57.207 --> 15:59.209
Well, it gets chilly
out on the lake.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.131
What do you think
I need them for?

16:01.131 --> 16:02.792
(SNORTS) To commit a crime?
(BOTH LAUGH NERVOUSLY)

16:02.792 --> 16:04.214
Hey, could you pass me
those bolt cutters?

16:06.926 --> 16:08.008
Bolt cutters?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.552
Well, I'm off. (CHUCKLES)

16:12.552 --> 16:15.515
And in case anyone asks,
you never saw me leave camp.

16:16.356 --> 16:17.517
Wink!

16:18.148 --> 16:19.269
Wait!

16:20.270 --> 16:22.902
Your pen pal Erin
came by earlier,

16:22.902 --> 16:24.274
and wanted to
talk to you.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.565
BOTH: She did?

16:25.565 --> 16:29.199
Yes, I shall go
get her right now!

16:34.704 --> 16:36.246
Hey, Xander.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.288
Sorry I locked you
in the meat locker.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.419
You should be.

16:39.419 --> 16:41.961
Parts of me
are still defrosting.

16:41.961 --> 16:44.384
Okay, I understand
if you want to

16:44.384 --> 16:46.216
give me
the "cold shoulder."

16:47.967 --> 16:49.259
Sorry. Too soon?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.342
This is so messed up.

16:52.342 --> 16:53.933
I really hate that
I hurt Emma's feelings,

16:53.933 --> 16:56.096
but talking about
my emotions

16:56.096 --> 16:58.728
just makes me
so uncomfortable.

16:58.728 --> 17:01.641
I hate talking about
my emotions, too.

17:01.641 --> 17:04.734
Even talking about
your emotions is
making me queasy.

17:06.236 --> 17:07.987
I really do want to
tell Emma how I feel,

17:07.987 --> 17:10.200
but I just don't know how.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.203
Well, your songs
are always full of emotion.

17:13.203 --> 17:14.784
Like the one you wrote
last summer,

17:14.784 --> 17:16.206
to ask Emma out?

17:16.206 --> 17:19.329
So, why don't you tell her
how you feel with a song?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.000
Oh, I see
what you're doing.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.332
You just want to
get that video done,

17:22.332 --> 17:24.124
so you can make money
and double your followers.

17:24.124 --> 17:27.127
(SIGHS) I promise
that's not true.

17:27.127 --> 17:28.798
I really do care about
you and Emma.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.262
Well, then...

17:32.262 --> 17:34.674
Maybe I could tell Emma
how I feel in a song.

17:34.674 --> 17:37.227
I mean, as soon as
my fingers thaw out.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.349
I'll go grab you
those rat mittens.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.274
So...

17:44.274 --> 17:45.525
I can't wait
to meet Erin.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.187
Me neither.

17:49.189 --> 17:51.491
RAVI: (IN GIRL'S VOICE)
Hello, Griff!

17:53.243 --> 17:55.245
It is I, Erin!

17:55.745 --> 17:56.996
Huh,

17:56.996 --> 17:59.829
Erin sounds a lot
different than I imagined.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.661
Sounds exactly like
I had imagined.

18:04.964 --> 18:07.417
So, Erin... (LAUGHS)

18:07.417 --> 18:09.259
Why don't you come out
and say "hi" in person?

18:09.259 --> 18:11.010
RAVI: Because...

18:11.010 --> 18:15.054
I have a cold, and I am
extremely contagious.

18:15.054 --> 18:16.266
Achoo!

18:17.637 --> 18:20.480
You know, I wish
you could meet
my friend, Ravi.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.432
I wonder where he is.

18:22.432 --> 18:26.316
RAVI: Oh, he's probably
scoring a touchdown
in soccer,

18:26.316 --> 18:29.028
or some other
manly pursuit.
Oh, brother.

18:31.151 --> 18:34.494
(STUTTERING) It's funny,
because you kind of
sound like Ravi.

18:34.494 --> 18:37.997
RAVI: Oh, that is
not possible.

18:37.997 --> 18:41.161
He is a handsome
young Indian boy,

18:41.161 --> 18:44.794
whilst I am a lovely
Gaelic lassie.

18:44.794 --> 18:47.167
That's it. I cannot
stand it anymore.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.708
The jig is up!

18:48.708 --> 18:50.710
What gave me away?
Everything.

18:52.342 --> 18:53.843
Look, guys,

18:53.843 --> 18:55.675
it's one thing to trick me
with fake letters,

18:55.675 --> 18:58.718
but how could you
possibly think I'd
steal a dirt bike?

18:58.718 --> 19:00.310
Gee, I don't know...
Maybe because you said

19:00.310 --> 19:02.061
you were gonna steal
a dirt bike.

19:02.061 --> 19:04.564
And half your T-shirts
say "Property of Maine
Prison System."

19:06.186 --> 19:08.608
(CHUCKLES)
Look, I'm sorry for
tricking you guys,

19:08.608 --> 19:10.320
but you started it.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.732
We only invented Erin
because we felt bad
that you never get any mail.

19:12.732 --> 19:14.734
Hey, Ravi never gets
any mail either.

19:14.734 --> 19:16.696
But I am a CIT, and...

19:16.696 --> 19:20.370
I can handle the
gut-wrenching pain
of disappointment.

19:20.370 --> 19:22.041
We were just trying to
cheer you up, Griff.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.333
And you succeeded.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.664
Listen, messing
with you guys

19:24.664 --> 19:26.416
was more fun than any letter
I could've gotten.

19:28.378 --> 19:30.750
And thanks for caring.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.001
You're welcome.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.346
So, at what point
were you onto us?

19:36.346 --> 19:38.558
From the second I saw
Ravi's dainty handwriting.

19:39.849 --> 19:41.010
Calligraphy.

19:45.355 --> 19:46.516
Hey, Emma.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.017
Can we please talk?

19:48.017 --> 19:50.230
I'm all ears,
Mr. McCormick.

19:51.311 --> 19:53.523
Look, I know I messed up,

19:53.523 --> 19:55.405
and there's nothing I can
say to make it up to you.

19:56.155 --> 19:57.277
But I can sing it.

19:57.987 --> 19:59.198
I wrote this song for you.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.417
♪ I've heard it said
timing's everything

20:07.417 --> 20:10.290
♪ Well, everything

20:11.711 --> 20:14.754
♪ You never know

♪ Just be ready

20:19.429 --> 20:23.012
♪ Life's a beach
tropic island getaway

♪ I came alive

20:24.344 --> 20:26.646
♪ Ever since the day you...

20:26.646 --> 20:28.518
♪ Hit me like
a freight train

20:28.518 --> 20:30.440
♪ Ooh, I did a double take

20:30.440 --> 20:33.563
♪ Body like a summer day

Xander, writing that song

21:42.762 --> 21:43.883
was the most
incredible thing

21:43.883 --> 21:45.515
anyone's ever done for me.

21:45.515 --> 21:47.727
And I once had a guy
offer to buy me an island.

21:47.727 --> 21:49.058
(CHUCKLES)
Wow.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.600
Like one of those little
Caribbean Islands?

21:50.600 --> 21:53.733
No. Manhattan.

21:53.733 --> 21:57.697
So I guess I'm not going with
that Free Hug Coupon Book
for your birthday.

21:57.697 --> 22:00.199
(CHUCKLES) Actually,
I would love that.

22:00.199 --> 22:01.781
In fact, I'll take one
right now.

22:01.781 --> 22:04.033
Oh. I'm sorry,
you don't have a coupon.

22:06.786 --> 22:10.660
Emma, I am so happy
we worked things out.

22:10.660 --> 22:13.833
You're so beautiful
and sweet.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.506
You're my everything.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.718
Thanks.

22:18.718 --> 22:19.959
Up top!

22:23.092 --> 22:24.384
Xander, guess what?

22:24.384 --> 22:27.597
We're up to a million
views on your video!

22:27.597 --> 22:29.969
My ChatSnap is exploding!

22:29.969 --> 22:33.563
Hey, I thought this song
wasn't supposed to be
about your ChatSnap.

22:33.563 --> 22:35.435
Come on, you know me
better than that.

22:36.646 --> 22:39.148
It's so cool that people
like my music so much.

22:39.148 --> 22:41.441
They do, but according
to the comments,

22:41.441 --> 22:43.903
they love Emma's
dancing even more.

22:43.903 --> 22:45.745
Oh, let's not
make this about me.

22:45.745 --> 22:47.747
This is about Xander.

22:47.747 --> 22:48.698
(WHISPERS)
Send me that link.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.081
Did anybody mention
my dancing?

22:52.622 --> 22:53.873
Ooh, read that one!

22:53.873 --> 22:55.875
It's from my  abuelo.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.877
"Jorge, get out
of the way,

22:57.877 --> 23:00.550
"and let  muy bonita
drop it like it's hot."
