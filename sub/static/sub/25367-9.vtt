<i>Previously on</i>" The Affair"...

00:06.129 --> 00:08.688
Uh, hi. I'm Alison.

00:08.765 --> 00:09.767
Ben.

00:09.845 --> 00:11.633
Yeah, when I got back
from my second tour,

00:11.710 --> 00:12.798
I was a disaster.

00:12.875 --> 00:16.078
And I, uh, 
had a hard time being...

00:16.645 --> 00:18.031
being intimate.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.556
Oh.

00:20.238 --> 00:22.282
It's pretty
interesting stuff, huh?

00:22.359 --> 00:23.690
You scared me.

00:23.767 --> 00:25.433
You can't just
sneak up on people

00:25.510 --> 00:27.610
at a conference about
posttraumatic stress.

00:27.687 --> 00:30.518
Sorry, uh, I didn't
realize I was that scary.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.162
We should meet up
all over the country

00:32.238 --> 00:34.046
at different
PTSD conferences.

00:37.343 --> 00:39.361
Are you having fun yet?

00:39.438 --> 00:40.878
What's that face?

00:40.955 --> 00:42.476
You amaze me.

00:44.199 --> 00:45.534
I'm looking for Ben Cruz.

00:45.611 --> 00:47.211
He is actually
at a lunch meeting,

00:47.288 --> 00:48.956
but he'll be back
any minute.

00:49.033 --> 00:51.425
- I-I...
- Mrs. Cruz, what are you doing?

00:51.502 --> 00:53.032
Please, let me
help you with that.

00:53.109 --> 00:54.300
Mrs. Cruz, please.

00:54.377 --> 00:55.992
I insist.
Let me do that.

00:56.104 --> 00:58.109
A lush. I love it.

00:58.186 --> 00:59.883
No, I just had a terrible day.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.250
Have you ever heard
of the, uh, mile-high club?

01:03.727 --> 01:05.569
I can't sit back
down there, okay?

01:05.646 --> 01:07.185
- He tried to kiss me.
- Calm down, ma'am.

01:07.262 --> 01:08.446
- This is a misunderstanding.
- I need you to calm down.

01:08.523 --> 01:09.572
Stop touching me!

01:09.649 --> 01:11.502
Noah? Hi.

01:11.986 --> 01:14.027
She just started
freaking out on the highway.

01:14.104 --> 01:15.521
I didn't know
where else to bring her.

01:15.598 --> 01:17.016
What about you?
You seeing anybody?

01:17.093 --> 01:18.813
I was.
He's married.

01:18.890 --> 01:21.120
Alison, you have
so much time.

01:21.197 --> 01:22.542
You could have
a second act.

01:22.619 --> 01:24.339
You could do whatever
you want to do.

01:24.416 --> 01:25.884
But if you want
to change your life,

01:25.961 --> 01:27.676
you have to do it now.

Hi.

04:22.897 --> 04:24.463
Hi.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.992
It's good to see you.

04:27.298 --> 04:29.656
Um, can I come in?

04:32.275 --> 04:34.492
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course. Um...

04:56.597 --> 04:58.212
It's beautiful here.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.645
Thank you.

05:00.728 --> 05:02.017
So...

05:02.478 --> 05:04.093
where'd you go?

05:04.506 --> 05:05.579
What do you mean?

05:05.656 --> 05:06.770
Last week.

05:07.072 --> 05:08.835
Thought we
had a date.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.667
I...

05:12.494 --> 05:14.135
It's for you.

05:14.329 --> 05:15.495
Thank you.

05:15.713 --> 05:16.823
Um, do you want to sit?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.610
I need to talk to you
about something.

05:18.687 --> 05:21.351
Actually, um, can I say
something first?

05:22.728 --> 05:24.478
Okay.

05:26.430 --> 05:27.837
I'm married.

05:32.292 --> 05:34.593
- Okay.
- I didn't tell you.

05:35.687 --> 05:38.145
Uh, no, you didn't.

05:38.222 --> 05:40.430
I was afraid you wouldn't
want to see me again.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.919
Well, you're right.

05:44.108 --> 05:46.014
But I already know.

05:47.202 --> 05:48.733
I found out.

05:50.072 --> 05:51.134
How?

05:53.119 --> 05:55.202
I went to see you
at your office.

05:55.279 --> 05:56.720
Your wife was there.

05:56.797 --> 05:57.817
Heidi?

05:57.895 --> 05:59.061
Mm-hmm.

06:01.104 --> 06:02.890
Okay. Um...

06:03.122 --> 06:04.327
did you speak to her?

06:04.404 --> 06:05.774
It doesn't matter.

06:07.866 --> 06:09.682
- You lied to me.
- I know.

06:09.759 --> 06:11.958
I told you everything
about myself.

06:12.345 --> 06:14.063
- I told you about my son.
- I know.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.862
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- That's it?

06:15.939 --> 06:17.923
- That's all you have to say?
- I have a lot to say.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.001
Do you want to sit?

06:19.078 --> 06:20.651
- No.
- Okay.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.100
Well, um, this might
take a while.

06:23.177 --> 06:24.576
I've been rehearsing
this for days,

06:24.653 --> 06:26.415
but I realize I may
never see you again,

06:26.492 --> 06:27.960
so I'm gonna say everything.

06:29.702 --> 06:31.410
Okay.

06:48.168 --> 06:49.978
So, uh...

06:52.955 --> 06:54.760
I left my wife today.

06:55.127 --> 06:57.552
- I don't believe you.
- I did. I can show you

06:57.629 --> 06:59.159
the angry text messages
I've been getting,

06:59.236 --> 07:00.569
if that would help.

07:03.619 --> 07:05.398
Our marriage is done.

07:06.764 --> 07:08.962
I should have left
a long time ago, but...

07:10.088 --> 07:11.586
I said it was for the kids,

07:11.663 --> 07:13.296
but it wasn't for the kids.

07:14.103 --> 07:16.820
I just didn't want to fail
at something else.

07:16.975 --> 07:18.251
And then I met you.

07:18.328 --> 07:19.935
I wanted to tell you.

07:20.012 --> 07:23.156
I-I tried to tell you, but...

07:23.241 --> 07:25.096
I knew, if I did,
you'd just walk away

07:25.173 --> 07:26.188
and I'd never see you again,

07:26.265 --> 07:28.328
and I couldn't make myself
say the words.

07:30.999 --> 07:34.562
You are literally
the woman of my dreams.

07:35.645 --> 07:37.462
I know it's not
the perfect situation,

07:37.539 --> 07:39.897
but I came here tonight
just hoping that maybe

07:39.974 --> 07:42.885
we can start again
with no more secrets.

07:55.556 --> 07:56.923
I'm Ben.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.409
I recently separated
from my wife,

07:59.486 --> 08:02.085
and I have two boys:

08:02.650 --> 08:05.070
Bodhi and Gabriel.

08:06.967 --> 08:08.423
Gabriel?

08:14.453 --> 08:15.931
Gabriel?

08:16.478 --> 08:18.757
Right. Okay.

08:19.794 --> 08:21.436
Uh...

08:21.599 --> 08:22.817
how old?

08:22.895 --> 08:24.318
Bodhi's six, and...

08:24.395 --> 08:25.514
Gabriel's a year.

08:25.591 --> 08:26.707
- Ben.
- Look, I know.

08:26.784 --> 08:28.313
I know it sounds bad.

08:28.390 --> 08:30.779
My wife and I,
we talked already.

08:30.856 --> 08:32.527
Look, we agreed,
this isn't the life

08:32.604 --> 08:33.847
that either of us wants.

08:33.924 --> 08:35.897
And we'd be happier
with other people.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.417
We'll be better
parents to our boys.

08:40.168 --> 08:41.866
I love you.

08:43.573 --> 08:45.689
That's what I came here to say.

08:49.302 --> 08:51.034
Say something.

08:52.536 --> 08:55.050
Thank you for
finally telling me.

08:55.270 --> 08:57.230
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

08:57.307 --> 08:58.504
I don't know, uh...

08:58.581 --> 08:59.545
you forgive me.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.190
- Doesn't matter. You love me, too.
- Oh, it does matter.

09:02.841 --> 09:04.522
And I don't forgive you.

09:04.599 --> 09:06.026
And how can I
tell you I love you?

09:06.103 --> 09:07.557
I don't even know you.

09:07.746 --> 09:10.177
Mmm. Yeah.

09:11.455 --> 09:12.646
Right.

09:19.205 --> 09:20.621
Wait.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.623
I have something
I want to say to you, too.

09:25.395 --> 09:26.536
Okay.

09:26.626 --> 09:28.184
- You're a shit.
- I know.

09:28.261 --> 09:29.566
You treated me badly.

09:29.643 --> 09:30.669
I did.

09:30.919 --> 09:32.344
I was honest with you.

09:32.421 --> 09:34.253
I told you who I am.

09:34.613 --> 09:35.793
I didn't lie to you.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.064
You lied to me.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.311
Yeah.

09:38.833 --> 09:39.928
Why?

09:40.411 --> 09:42.094
I screwed up.

09:43.435 --> 09:45.138
I'm weak.

09:47.255 --> 09:51.159
Ben, I am sorry
you broke up with your wife.

09:52.187 --> 09:55.147
I am sorry, most of all,
for your kids.

09:55.224 --> 09:57.456
And I am sorry that you and I

09:57.668 --> 10:01.593
never had a chance to see
where this could go.

10:02.931 --> 10:04.772
Because I really liked you.

10:06.104 --> 10:07.914
And I haven't felt
this way about anyone

10:07.991 --> 10:09.671
in a really long time.

10:11.443 --> 10:13.405
But I am done

10:13.895 --> 10:16.522
being the woman you lie
to your wife about.

10:16.772 --> 10:20.163
I have lived this
entire story before,

10:20.287 --> 10:21.730
and it doesn't end well,

10:21.807 --> 10:24.805
and I... couldn't go through
with it again,

10:24.882 --> 10:26.764
even if I wanted to.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.897
Do you understand?

10:32.774 --> 10:34.843
Of course I understand.

10:42.306 --> 10:44.291
Um... should I...

10:44.368 --> 10:46.313
should I let
myself out, or, uh...

10:46.390 --> 10:47.560
Yeah.

10:48.632 --> 10:50.389
Guess you should.

10:57.899 --> 10:59.952
You should get
someone to fix that.

11:00.423 --> 11:01.735
Yeah, I know.

11:01.812 --> 11:03.281
Called the plumber
a couple of times.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.260
Just keeps standing me up.

11:07.384 --> 11:10.983
I mean, I can fix it for you
right now if you want.

11:15.222 --> 11:16.485
Or not.

11:16.735 --> 11:18.151
No.

11:18.228 --> 11:19.524
Um...

11:20.738 --> 11:22.197
Thank you.

11:49.985 --> 11:51.382
- Ah.
- That's it.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.759
Oh.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.860
Seems like an old sink.

11:54.937 --> 11:57.968
I might as well just get
under there and tighten it up.

12:06.478 --> 12:08.672
Thank you so much
for doing this.

12:08.749 --> 12:10.177
Yeah. No problem.

12:10.261 --> 12:11.751
This is fun for me.

12:15.293 --> 12:18.897
I-I could make you some dinner,
you know, before you go.

12:21.525 --> 12:22.732
Okay.

12:28.705 --> 12:30.206
Uh...

12:31.352 --> 12:34.203
Well, I have some eggs or...

12:36.259 --> 12:37.837
Uh...

12:37.914 --> 12:39.279
Uh, what are
you doing?

12:39.356 --> 12:41.921
I'm going to make us
something. Yeah.

12:41.998 --> 12:43.851
Well, no, I-I offered
to make you dinner.

12:43.928 --> 12:45.166
Yeah, and I
appreciated that offer.

12:45.243 --> 12:46.929
Now, um, give me some space.

12:47.006 --> 12:48.557
Go pour yourself
a glass of wine.

12:48.634 --> 12:49.764
Relax.

13:55.288 --> 13:57.514
Your wife is very beautiful.

14:02.788 --> 14:04.110
Yeah.

14:04.596 --> 14:06.358
She's definitely that.

14:09.718 --> 14:12.202
Did you really end it with her?

14:13.634 --> 14:15.080
I swear.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.256
Did you tell her about me?

14:22.019 --> 14:23.259
No.

14:23.914 --> 14:25.632
That just seemed cruel.

14:27.812 --> 14:29.507
What did you say?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.048
I said...

14:34.272 --> 14:38.100
I didn't love her
anymore, and...

14:38.399 --> 14:40.749
she said she didn't
love me anymore, either.

14:51.550 --> 14:53.998
Why? What happened
between you two?

14:56.694 --> 14:58.236
I, uh...

15:00.451 --> 15:02.192
I went to war.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.188
I just...

15:08.373 --> 15:09.671
Changed me.

15:11.157 --> 15:13.702
I don't know how to describe it
any better than that.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.768
And Heidi, she was raised
by a single mom

15:17.845 --> 15:20.334
who couldn't make the rent,
and, uh...

15:20.779 --> 15:23.319
she basically grew up in a car.

15:23.538 --> 15:26.335
She wanted a man, you know...
Capital "M."

15:26.497 --> 15:29.843
Someone to take care of her,

15:30.384 --> 15:32.420
be strong, make money,

15:32.497 --> 15:34.279
tell her
she was pretty.

15:38.108 --> 15:40.460
She just didn't want
to have to worry anymore.

15:44.679 --> 15:46.866
That's who she thought
she married.

15:48.122 --> 15:50.528
That's who we both
thought I was.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.327
What changed?

15:59.368 --> 16:01.194
It was my, uh...

16:01.454 --> 16:04.655
second combat tour
in Afghanistan, and...

16:05.113 --> 16:07.101
I'd been deployed for 12 months,

16:07.178 --> 16:10.350
which is a ridiculous
amount of time.

16:11.122 --> 16:12.656
And one day,
we ran out of fuel

16:12.733 --> 16:14.962
for the generator
on our base, and, uh...

16:15.039 --> 16:17.494
I took out a Humvee with a few
of the guys from my platoon.

16:17.571 --> 16:20.043
It was just supposed to be a
simple resupply mission, but...

16:20.120 --> 16:21.455
we'd been given
the wrong information,

16:21.532 --> 16:23.571
and when we got there...

16:25.386 --> 16:27.584
the fuel didn't exist.

16:30.164 --> 16:32.090
So we had to return empty-handed

16:32.167 --> 16:33.999
on the same road we had
traveled that morning,

16:34.076 --> 16:36.962
which is a stupid
and dangerous thing to do.

16:37.095 --> 16:39.637
I just had two weeks
left on my tour,

16:39.714 --> 16:42.129
and all I could think about
was getting home to Heidi,

16:42.206 --> 16:43.542
a bath,

16:44.300 --> 16:46.009
a beer on our deck,

16:46.636 --> 16:48.301
putting Bodhi to sleep

16:48.378 --> 16:50.704
and, uh, taking
her clothes off and, uh...

16:52.206 --> 16:53.589
Sorry.

16:53.914 --> 16:55.206
No.

16:55.284 --> 16:57.024
I understand.

17:02.002 --> 17:03.813
Anyway, um...

17:05.236 --> 17:06.564
Out of the corner
of my eye,

17:06.641 --> 17:09.063
I could see these kids
watching us

17:09.651 --> 17:11.534
from the door
of a building, and...

17:11.611 --> 17:14.031
It used to be a school,
but we bombed it.

17:14.175 --> 17:15.997
And, uh...

17:17.884 --> 17:20.016
My stomach just fell

17:20.869 --> 17:23.692
because I had seen those
same kids on the way out,

17:23.769 --> 17:25.859
and here they were again
waiting for us.

17:29.342 --> 17:34.000
I just begged, "God, Jesus,
Mary, just let us pass.

17:34.077 --> 17:37.376
Keep those kids
in the fucking rubble."

17:39.856 --> 17:42.165
One of them...

17:42.622 --> 17:44.500
he was tall.

17:44.577 --> 17:46.954
Had to be 13 or 14.

17:48.248 --> 17:50.675
Sure enough, he came
running towards us

17:50.752 --> 17:52.982
with what looked like a weapon.

17:53.059 --> 17:56.165
And he raised it,
and I realized it was an RPG.

17:57.058 --> 17:58.721
Before he could
pull the trigger,

17:58.798 --> 17:59.971
I pulled mine, and...

18:00.048 --> 18:01.247
he fell.

18:04.487 --> 18:06.001
You killed him?

18:06.122 --> 18:07.401
Yeah.

18:11.644 --> 18:14.372
His weapon wasn't real.

18:15.955 --> 18:17.470
What do you mean?

18:19.767 --> 18:22.129
"RPG" stands for
"rocket-propelled grenade."

18:22.206 --> 18:23.877
It's like a gun
that shoots a grenade.

18:23.954 --> 18:25.458
And, uh...

18:27.486 --> 18:29.766
Well, the one he was
holding, it wasn't...

18:30.006 --> 18:32.079
didn't have a grenade attached.

18:34.316 --> 18:35.774
It was old.

18:36.206 --> 18:38.079
It was essentially a toy.

18:41.691 --> 18:44.884
What, you killed an unarmed kid?

18:45.300 --> 18:46.526
Yeah.

18:46.604 --> 18:48.891
Where do you...
where do you keep your plates?

18:52.847 --> 18:54.519
Uh, um...

18:55.369 --> 18:56.754
just here.

19:47.955 --> 19:50.249
So that's what you
walk around with?

19:50.456 --> 19:51.747
Every day?

19:59.970 --> 20:02.288
When I got back home...

20:04.851 --> 20:07.216
I couldn't stand Heidi anymore.

20:10.622 --> 20:12.608
It wasn't her fault.
It just...

20:13.247 --> 20:15.085
The way she looked at me.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.639
The way she needed me.

20:24.517 --> 20:26.272
One night, I, uh...

20:28.622 --> 20:31.460
I got wasted, and...

20:31.955 --> 20:33.711
I tied her to the bed
on her stomach

20:33.788 --> 20:35.772
so I wouldn't have
to look at her face.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.944
I wouldn't let her go.

20:43.483 --> 20:45.718
Not even when Bodhi
started to cry.

21:03.433 --> 21:06.507
I got clean soon
after that, and, uh...

21:07.553 --> 21:09.835
I haven't touched a drink since.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.819
I haven't touched her, either.

21:22.206 --> 21:23.289
You done?

21:23.367 --> 21:24.784
Uh, yeah.

21:40.556 --> 21:43.339
I haven't told anyone
what I just told you.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.546
That last part.

21:52.399 --> 21:54.089
But I think about it
all the time.

21:54.166 --> 21:57.155
Just... people I've hurt,

21:57.384 --> 21:59.130
lives I've ruined.

22:01.285 --> 22:03.983
All I want is
to somehow be forgiven.

22:07.502 --> 22:09.991
I know that's not
possible, so...

22:39.099 --> 22:40.569
You know, I have a...

22:40.646 --> 22:43.702
I have a rare day every so often

22:43.986 --> 22:47.608
where I feel
a little more still inside.

22:48.791 --> 22:50.864
It's-it's usually
in the late fall,

22:50.941 --> 22:53.350
when the summer people
have gone and...

22:54.183 --> 22:57.397
I can hear the wind
and the water,

22:57.640 --> 23:00.210
and the birds, nothing else.

23:01.317 --> 23:03.698
That's when my heart,
like, hurts

23:03.775 --> 23:06.139
for how beautiful
it is out here.

23:07.890 --> 23:09.921
I want to...

23:10.572 --> 23:12.228
drink the air.

23:14.036 --> 23:15.900
Live in the sunsets.

23:20.140 --> 23:21.505
And then I...

23:21.582 --> 23:25.499
It's not that I feel
forgiven exactly,

23:26.185 --> 23:29.258
but I feel at peace
with what happened.

23:33.422 --> 23:34.530
What?

23:34.676 --> 23:36.710
Forgiven for what?

23:38.911 --> 23:41.655
I mean, what happened
to your son wasn't your fault.

23:43.976 --> 23:45.351
Was it?

23:46.774 --> 23:48.649
Yeah.

23:49.140 --> 23:52.428
How? I thought
your husband was with him.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.409
No, he-he didn't drown
in the water.

23:59.196 --> 24:01.225
Um, he had fluid in his lungs,

24:01.302 --> 24:03.458
and I didn't take him
to the hospital.

24:04.932 --> 24:07.047
He drowned in his sleep.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.156
That can happen?

24:10.390 --> 24:11.721
Mm-hmm.

24:12.390 --> 24:14.570
It's called secondary drowning.

24:16.473 --> 24:18.255
I never heard of it.

24:19.522 --> 24:21.683
He seemed fine,
and then at night,

24:21.760 --> 24:25.172
he vomited, had diarrhea.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.742
He said his shoulder
hurt, and...

24:30.385 --> 24:32.309
Cole wanted me to take him
to the hospital,

24:32.386 --> 24:35.461
but I-I was...
I was mad at Cole.

24:35.929 --> 24:38.175
Because he had
spent the whole day

24:38.252 --> 24:39.353
flirting with Jocelyn.

24:39.430 --> 24:40.439
It was just...

24:40.516 --> 24:41.932
And...

24:45.625 --> 24:48.283
I was a nurse, you know.
I thought I knew better.

24:54.349 --> 24:56.380
In the morning, he was gray.

24:58.437 --> 25:00.578
He died without making a sound.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.979
Jesus.

25:07.515 --> 25:09.789
Sorry.

25:10.057 --> 25:12.500
Maybe you didn't want
to know all that.

25:12.723 --> 25:14.713
Of course I did.

25:15.601 --> 25:16.976
I do.

25:29.322 --> 25:31.664
I've had this, um...

25:32.702 --> 25:35.484
recurring dream lately,

25:36.390 --> 25:38.505
where I'm talking to Gabriel.

25:39.577 --> 25:43.312
And, um, he's a teenager.

25:43.681 --> 25:46.469
And I'm sitting on the edge
of his bed, and...

25:46.844 --> 25:48.984
His little mustache.

25:49.291 --> 25:51.375
And his feet smell.

25:51.869 --> 25:53.880
He's listening to music.

25:55.182 --> 25:57.961
And he keeps saying,
"Go away, Mom.

25:58.197 --> 25:59.963
Leave me alone."

26:00.815 --> 26:02.930
I know that's what he needs.

26:04.645 --> 26:05.933
I just can't.

26:06.010 --> 26:08.130
I can't leave.

26:09.819 --> 26:13.018
Keeps telling me to go,
and I just can't get off...

26:13.431 --> 26:15.130
off the bed.

26:21.807 --> 26:24.047
And he's so angry at me.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.484
And his skin is still so gray.

26:36.015 --> 26:37.515
Anyway...

26:40.015 --> 26:42.225
You know, some days,
I'm-I'm proud

26:42.302 --> 26:44.148
of the life that I've built.

26:44.515 --> 26:47.610
You know, I have my daughter
and my career, and...

26:47.687 --> 26:50.098
I've grown, persevered.

26:55.085 --> 26:57.398
And I think he'd be
proud of me, too.

26:59.182 --> 27:02.001
And then sometimes, it just
feels like a giant charade,

27:02.078 --> 27:04.050
and I'm still the same

27:04.127 --> 27:06.100
broken person I was
at the hospital,

27:06.177 --> 27:08.617
the same empty shell
at his funeral,

27:09.182 --> 27:11.399
and this is all a joke
I've been playing on myself.

27:11.476 --> 27:15.388
This life that
I am trying to live.

27:21.136 --> 27:22.803
No, I...

28:13.760 --> 28:15.297
What are you doing?

28:15.541 --> 28:17.347
What's it look like I'm doing?

28:18.390 --> 28:20.255
I want you to dance with me.

28:25.599 --> 28:27.937
Come on. It's my favorite song.

28:30.765 --> 28:34.100
<i>♪ Azúcar morena ♪</i>

28:34.177 --> 28:37.484

28:42.830 --> 28:44.831

28:44.908 --> 28:46.939
What happens
to people like us?

28:47.525 --> 28:49.179
What do you mean?

28:50.775 --> 28:53.445
The ones who can't
be forgiven.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.880
The shrinks will say
we have to forgive ourselves.

29:00.751 --> 29:02.502
I can't.

29:05.549 --> 29:09.386
But if you don't,
if you don't, then...

29:09.463 --> 29:11.524
what's the rest
of your life?

29:11.601 --> 29:13.211
One long penance?

29:17.246 --> 29:20.781
My mom believes
that we live multiple lives

29:21.099 --> 29:23.243
and that each one
is a step toward,

29:23.320 --> 29:26.064
you know, nirvana, I guess.

29:27.369 --> 29:28.984
Perfection.

29:30.848 --> 29:34.172
We just keep coming back
until we get it right.

29:37.861 --> 29:41.297
Maybe this is as far
as I come in this life.

29:43.788 --> 29:47.570
So you're just waiting to die?

29:49.752 --> 29:52.250
Aren't you?

29:52.650 --> 29:54.702

being honest with yourself?

30:31.783 --> 30:33.482

Hi.

Can I come in?

34:40.385 --> 34:42.759
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

34:45.529 --> 34:47.186
Didn't you hear me knocking?

34:48.085 --> 34:50.009
Uh, no, uh...

34:50.085 --> 34:51.641
Sorry, I had the music up.

34:56.237 --> 34:57.405
What happened to your hand?

34:57.482 --> 34:59.331
- Uh, it's fine. It's...
- You okay? Let me see.

34:59.408 --> 35:01.239
No, it's fine.
It's just, I need a Band-Aid.

35:02.471 --> 35:04.180
You know, a stubborn
streak like that

35:04.257 --> 35:05.845
will get you
killed in combat.

35:26.336 --> 35:27.366
So?

35:27.444 --> 35:28.444
So.

35:28.522 --> 35:29.796
So, what
happened to you?

35:29.873 --> 35:30.922
Why'd you stand me up?

35:30.999 --> 35:32.756
I went to L.A.
for the weekend.

35:32.833 --> 35:33.955
Why?

35:34.827 --> 35:35.924
To visit a friend.

35:36.001 --> 35:38.483
You didn't call and tell me
you changed your plans?

35:38.560 --> 35:39.985
I mean, I waited
outside that yoga studio

35:40.062 --> 35:41.559
for an hour, Alison.

35:43.336 --> 35:44.545
Why don't you sit?

35:44.622 --> 35:47.484
Um, I'll make us some tea.

35:53.085 --> 35:54.966
I thought we were
going out to dinner.

35:55.130 --> 35:58.665
No, I just wanted to talk
to you for a bit first.

35:58.742 --> 35:59.856
I'm really hungry.

35:59.933 --> 36:01.168
Won't take long.

36:01.376 --> 36:04.189
Um, let me take your wet coat.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.679
So, about the other night, I...

36:24.756 --> 36:26.943
Before you talk,
can I say something first?

36:29.704 --> 36:31.086
Of course.

36:33.129 --> 36:35.491
Uh, you can't do stuff
like that to me.

36:37.002 --> 36:39.004
- Stuff like what?
- Stand me up.

36:39.081 --> 36:40.349
Not call me
for four days.

36:40.426 --> 36:42.610
I mean, it's taken a lot
for me to trust you.

36:42.687 --> 36:45.511
Okay, I'm making myself really
vulnerable here, you know?

36:48.892 --> 36:51.728
Uh, yeah, yeah, I-I know. I...

36:51.805 --> 36:53.981
Okay. Good.

36:54.162 --> 36:57.191
I... I just had
to say that.

36:58.254 --> 37:00.034
What do you want
to talk about?

37:09.249 --> 37:11.239
Alison, what's going on?

37:12.325 --> 37:14.001
Are you okay?

37:14.951 --> 37:16.967
Uh, yeah, I just wanted
to ask some questions.

37:17.044 --> 37:18.326
I just...

37:19.109 --> 37:20.844
You know, it occurred
to me we don't really

37:20.921 --> 37:22.842
know that much
about each other.

37:23.166 --> 37:25.633
Yeah, like, uh, I had no idea

37:25.710 --> 37:27.516
you knew anyone in California.

37:29.430 --> 37:31.329
Of course.

37:32.089 --> 37:34.465
What do you want to talk about?
I'll tell you anything.

37:36.543 --> 37:39.042
Okay. Okay.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.135
Um...

37:45.437 --> 37:47.052
Where'd you grow up?

37:49.052 --> 37:50.302
The Bronx.

37:51.355 --> 37:53.228
What's your family like?

37:54.085 --> 37:56.883
I'm, uh, the third of four.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.703
Four boys and a girl.

38:00.551 --> 38:01.798
Where are your parents?

38:01.875 --> 38:04.162
My dad still
lives on 186th,

38:04.682 --> 38:06.334
and my mom is dead.

38:06.627 --> 38:09.126
She died of leukemia
when I was 21.

38:11.710 --> 38:13.021
- Sorry. I...
- It's okay.

38:13.098 --> 38:14.717
Um, anything else?

38:16.414 --> 38:18.863
Um, yeah.
Where do you live now?

38:20.530 --> 38:22.070
Hicksville,
but you know that already.

38:22.147 --> 38:23.326
Who do you live with?

38:23.790 --> 38:24.793
What?

38:25.047 --> 38:26.556
- What do you mean?
- Do you have

38:26.633 --> 38:29.124
a roommate or, you know,
family, any...?

38:29.201 --> 38:31.058
Wh-Where are these
questions coming from?

38:31.135 --> 38:32.266
I'm just... just curious.

38:32.343 --> 38:33.793
- It's just...
- This have to do with Cole?

38:33.870 --> 38:35.004
Cole? What? No.

38:35.081 --> 38:36.605
You know what's fucked-up
about that guy?

38:36.682 --> 38:38.740
- About Cole?
- Yeah, he-he came

38:38.817 --> 38:40.712
to an AA meeting,
but he's not an addict, is he?

38:40.789 --> 38:42.626
- Not that I'm aware of, no.
- Well, that's bullshit.

38:42.703 --> 38:44.970
Well, I'm sure he had
a good reason for being there.

38:45.047 --> 38:46.745
It's a little perverse,
don't you think?

38:46.823 --> 38:48.444
Those meetings
are vulnerable spaces.

38:48.521 --> 38:50.350
The guys really have
to trust each other.

38:52.105 --> 38:53.895
I-I'm happy
to keep talking.

38:53.972 --> 38:56.223
I just need something to eat.
I'm really starving.

38:57.127 --> 38:58.770
Uh, sure.
I-I can make you

38:58.847 --> 39:01.050
some eggs or...

39:01.281 --> 39:02.402
uh, maybe some...

39:02.479 --> 39:03.808
I have, uh...

39:04.002 --> 39:05.449
crackers and cheese?

39:05.526 --> 39:07.187
Yeah, yeah, anything.

39:34.879 --> 39:36.018
Have you ever been married?

39:38.191 --> 39:39.709
Why are you asking me that?

39:39.786 --> 39:40.853
It's just a question.

39:40.930 --> 39:42.753
What happened in California?

39:44.461 --> 39:46.326
Who's this friend
you went to go see?

39:48.666 --> 39:50.107
Went to see my ex-husband.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.921
Okay. How'd that go?

39:55.045 --> 39:56.056
Fine.

39:56.134 --> 39:58.450
Well, he must have said
something that upset you.

39:58.527 --> 40:00.396
No, that's not
what this is about.

40:01.285 --> 40:02.759
Are you sure?

40:03.068 --> 40:05.087
It just seemed like everything
was fine last week,

40:05.164 --> 40:07.462
and then you stand me up,
flee to California

40:07.539 --> 40:09.469
and talk to your ex?

40:09.546 --> 40:11.333
Suddenly,
I'm the bad guy?

40:18.842 --> 40:20.658
Ben, are you married?

40:23.562 --> 40:26.054
Why would I be here
if I was married?

40:32.044 --> 40:33.664
Have you ever...

40:34.252 --> 40:35.618
Have you ever been married?

40:35.695 --> 40:37.520
- No.
- Do you live alone?

40:37.597 --> 40:38.640
Yes.

40:50.502 --> 40:51.883
Do you have kids?

40:53.907 --> 40:55.014
No.

41:02.143 --> 41:03.962
What kind of tea do you want?

41:28.419 --> 41:30.110
I don't want tea.

41:34.086 --> 41:35.392
Hey.

41:39.294 --> 41:41.041
What's going on?

41:42.111 --> 41:43.899
What happened?

41:44.502 --> 41:46.568
You don't
trust me anymore.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.573
This thing that's
happening between us

41:59.543 --> 42:01.828
doesn't happen
to me all the time.

42:02.211 --> 42:03.931
Does it happen to you?

42:14.211 --> 42:16.451
So, why are you trying
to fuck it up?

42:26.313 --> 42:28.541
You don't even know me, Ben.

42:29.207 --> 42:30.522
Yes, I do.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.089
And I don't know you.

42:55.220 --> 42:57.994
I-I've been in love
twice in my life.

42:58.816 --> 43:00.749
- Am I one of them?
- No.

43:01.845 --> 43:03.783
Okay. Your two exes,
I assume.

43:03.860 --> 43:05.044
Yes.

43:05.437 --> 43:06.777
They were really
different loves,

43:06.854 --> 43:08.840
but they had
something in common.

43:09.786 --> 43:11.753
I-I felt kind of like the victim

43:11.830 --> 43:13.287
in both situations.

43:17.583 --> 43:18.583
Okay.

43:18.894 --> 43:20.118
How so?

43:22.662 --> 43:25.902
Well, my... with my first,
with Cole, I was...

43:27.178 --> 43:28.622
I was always a mess.

43:28.699 --> 43:32.349
He was always the solid one,
and I was always falling apart.

43:32.991 --> 43:36.522
And I convinced myself that he
would one day cheat on me.

43:37.169 --> 43:39.615
So, instead, I...
I cheated on him.

43:41.591 --> 43:45.019
And even after it was over,
I still told myself

43:45.096 --> 43:46.932
that he was to blame.

43:47.676 --> 43:50.800
I told myself that he
had driven me to do it

43:50.877 --> 43:53.293
because he was
so unfeeling, so rigid.

43:53.370 --> 43:55.259
After our son died, he...

43:55.411 --> 43:57.384
he made me carry the grief
for both of us,

43:57.461 --> 43:59.039
so what choice
did I have, really?

43:59.116 --> 44:00.822
- You didn't.
- Then, with Noah,

44:00.899 --> 44:02.296
it was the opposite.
He was the dreamer.

44:02.373 --> 44:04.447
He was the dramatic one.
He... I was the homebody.

44:04.524 --> 44:07.356
He said that I grounded him,
and yet I cheated on him, too.

44:08.463 --> 44:12.320
And yet again,
I convinced myself

44:12.397 --> 44:13.602
that I was not to blame,

44:13.679 --> 44:16.421
because he had abandoned me
for his career, his ambition,

44:16.498 --> 44:19.065
so... what else could I do?

44:19.142 --> 44:21.141
Okay. What are you
trying to say?

44:21.218 --> 44:24.017
I-I-I just... I just think
that sometimes we get

44:24.094 --> 44:27.587
into these patterns in life,
and we tell ourselves a story

44:27.664 --> 44:28.990
about what kind of person
we are

44:29.067 --> 44:33.211
and how people treat us,
and it's not always true.

44:34.189 --> 44:37.294
And... and as painful
as it's been to really

44:37.371 --> 44:40.658
own up to my faults
and to recognize that...

44:40.919 --> 44:43.622
I contributed to these
relationships falling apart,

44:43.699 --> 44:46.361
it's also...

44:46.442 --> 44:48.035
it's been really...

44:55.466 --> 44:58.770
Made me like myself in a way
that I never did before.

45:08.791 --> 45:09.916
Ben?

45:18.710 --> 45:20.984
Ben, please just
be honest with me.

45:22.104 --> 45:23.855
I can take it.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.992
Just tell me who you are.

45:43.854 --> 45:45.677
Tell me the truth.

46:07.352 --> 46:09.117
You want to know
who I am?

46:10.394 --> 46:11.603
Hmm?

46:12.793 --> 46:14.098
Really?

46:15.360 --> 46:16.694
Yes.

46:20.484 --> 46:22.232
Okay. All right.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.791
You...

46:29.445 --> 46:31.425
What are you doing?

46:31.502 --> 46:33.610
I'm gonna need
a drink for this.

46:35.999 --> 46:37.646
Ben, don't.

46:38.184 --> 46:39.925
It's fine, Alison.

46:52.879 --> 46:55.123
I haven't told you
what I did, have I?

46:56.329 --> 46:57.733
What do you mean?

46:59.383 --> 47:00.995
During the war.

47:03.695 --> 47:04.741
No.

47:05.444 --> 47:06.629
Are you comfortable?

47:06.706 --> 47:07.837
Maybe you should sit.

47:07.914 --> 47:09.647
I'm... fine.

47:11.142 --> 47:12.359
Good.

47:13.017 --> 47:14.548
This may take a while.

47:19.397 --> 47:20.962
I was deployed for too long.

47:21.039 --> 47:22.864
Only four months home.

47:23.211 --> 47:25.131
Half of which I spent
in the fucking hospital

47:25.208 --> 47:28.942
because a fucking IED
took off both my buddy's legs

47:29.019 --> 47:30.840
and all the skin off mine.

47:33.096 --> 47:35.853
But then I was right back
in the sandbox.

47:37.032 --> 47:39.272
I mean, I barely had time
to visit my father

47:39.349 --> 47:41.178
before they shipped me back out.

47:42.788 --> 47:44.530
Six months into
my second deployment,

47:44.607 --> 47:46.483
I didn't give a shit anymore.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.527
I was done.

47:47.604 --> 47:49.027
All the other guys,
they were all,

47:49.104 --> 47:50.777
"Oh, I'm part of a machine
that never loses.

47:50.854 --> 47:51.889
I'm a U.S. Marine."

47:51.966 --> 47:54.454
Now, I was like,
"We're losing, assholes.

47:54.531 --> 47:56.680
We fucking lost."

47:59.763 --> 48:01.400
Everyone knew it.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.432
Even the president knew it.

48:03.835 --> 48:06.439
But there I was again,
back in the shit.

48:06.917 --> 48:08.800
More counter-insurgency
nonsense,

48:08.877 --> 48:10.964
where they can shoot us
but we can't shoot them.

48:12.223 --> 48:13.571
Ben, stop.

48:13.826 --> 48:17.110
Let me finish, please.

48:20.823 --> 48:21.866
We took a Humvee

48:21.943 --> 48:23.967
out of the base
one morning to get fuel.

48:24.044 --> 48:25.505
It was a stupid
thing to do.

48:25.582 --> 48:28.210
It was one of those orders
that comes from above.

48:29.209 --> 48:32.248
Everyone knows it's
a fucking suicide mission,

48:32.325 --> 48:34.962
and I was like,
"Let it come.

48:35.426 --> 48:37.337
If I can't go home
in an airplane,

48:37.414 --> 48:39.258
then I'll go home in a casket."

48:44.668 --> 48:46.342
This kid...

48:46.997 --> 48:50.842
he came running towards us
with a burnt-out RPG.

48:50.919 --> 48:53.477
He must have found it
discarded somewhere, and...

48:53.579 --> 48:55.274
and he pointed it at me.

48:56.044 --> 48:58.041
He was just playing around.

48:59.578 --> 49:01.107
But I killed him.

49:02.184 --> 49:03.486
You what?

49:06.002 --> 49:07.872
Yeah. I shot him.

49:09.919 --> 49:11.252
Wait.

49:11.336 --> 49:13.536
But you knew he was unarmed.

49:13.871 --> 49:15.159
Yeah.

49:17.530 --> 49:19.587
Yeah, I mean, there was
no grenade attached.

49:19.664 --> 49:21.200
I could see that.

49:22.216 --> 49:24.096
But you shot him anyway?

49:27.240 --> 49:28.453
Yes.

49:31.793 --> 49:32.920
Why?

49:35.752 --> 49:38.080
I think I just wanted
to go home.

49:44.501 --> 49:45.654
So there.

49:46.633 --> 49:48.178
Now you know me.

49:48.698 --> 49:50.769
That's who I am.

49:54.585 --> 49:55.672
Are you sorry?

49:55.749 --> 49:57.657
Of course I'm sorry.

49:59.137 --> 50:01.014
But it wasn't my fucking fault.

50:01.091 --> 50:02.892
That kid was old enough
to know what he was doing.

50:02.969 --> 50:05.060
He shouldn't have been playing
with a fucking gun.

50:05.137 --> 50:07.299
But you knew it wasn't
an actual weapon.

50:07.461 --> 50:09.382
So, why'd you do it?

50:11.993 --> 50:14.523
Why do you kill an ant, Alison?

50:14.600 --> 50:16.094
Why do you kill a mouse?

50:16.964 --> 50:18.342
Because you don't
fucking want it

50:18.419 --> 50:19.611
running around your house.

50:19.688 --> 50:21.808
Because you don't want it
bothering you.

50:30.940 --> 50:32.140
Okay.

50:43.957 --> 50:45.563
Ben, it's getting late.

50:47.238 --> 50:48.793
I think maybe
I should go to bed.

50:48.870 --> 50:50.807
Fantastic. I'll join you.

50:50.884 --> 50:52.832
No, I-I want to be alone.

50:52.919 --> 50:54.204
Why?

50:54.933 --> 50:57.825
I-I'm just...
it's just been a long week,

50:57.902 --> 51:00.212
- and I'm... I'm really tired.
- Tired of fucking your

51:00.289 --> 51:02.174
- ex-husband in California?
- Oh, my God, no.

51:02.251 --> 51:03.415
- That's not what happened.
- Come on, Alison.

51:03.492 --> 51:04.620
Okay, you don't have
to believe me.

51:04.697 --> 51:05.746
Good, because I don't.

51:05.823 --> 51:07.693
Okay, Ben, I just
want you to go.

51:09.606 --> 51:11.461
What's going on?

51:13.195 --> 51:14.487
Last week was fine.

51:14.564 --> 51:17.133
You go to California,
you come back a different person.

51:17.901 --> 51:19.587
I'm a different person?
What about you?

51:19.664 --> 51:21.451
- I mean...
- This is who I am.

51:21.652 --> 51:24.327
This is who I've always been.
You're just peeling the onion.

51:24.404 --> 51:27.565
Yeah, but you didn't tell me
that you're, uh...

51:28.143 --> 51:30.026
What? What,
I didn't tell you

51:30.103 --> 51:31.187
what happened
in the sandbox?

51:31.264 --> 51:32.502
I'm sorry, I was
building up to that.

51:32.579 --> 51:34.087
- It's not exactly first-date material.
- No,

51:34.164 --> 51:35.391
- you didn't tell me that...
- What?

51:35.468 --> 51:36.471
Nothing, okay?

51:36.548 --> 51:38.296
I just want you to leave.

51:38.373 --> 51:39.587
I don't want this.

51:39.664 --> 51:41.284
You don't want what?

51:43.919 --> 51:45.409
You don't want this?

51:51.639 --> 51:53.097
Or this?

52:03.390 --> 52:04.777
No.

52:09.364 --> 52:10.526
Please go.

52:21.917 --> 52:24.911
I can't believe
you're doing this.

52:25.169 --> 52:28.825
Why are you fucking doing this?

52:41.359 --> 52:44.159
Ben, please, I...

52:44.523 --> 52:46.116
I just need a minute.

52:46.543 --> 52:48.169
Okay?

52:52.435 --> 52:54.979
I need you, Alison.

52:57.088 --> 52:58.869
I'm in so much pain.

53:13.452 --> 53:15.276
I know it scares you.

53:16.242 --> 53:17.532
It scares me, too,

53:17.609 --> 53:19.855
but we could be good together.

53:21.315 --> 53:22.676
I know.

53:27.344 --> 53:29.167
You can do this.

53:31.485 --> 53:34.481
Yes, you can.
We both can.

53:34.558 --> 53:36.691
- We both can.
- No.

53:37.540 --> 53:40.300
I need you so badly.

53:40.377 --> 53:42.117
I just need this.

53:43.793 --> 53:45.545
I need this, Alison.
I need you.

53:45.622 --> 53:46.777
You need to go home.

53:46.854 --> 53:48.050
Just give me a minute.

53:48.127 --> 53:49.795
- Please. No.
- Just give me a minute.

53:49.872 --> 53:51.501
Just go home
to your fucking wife.

53:54.663 --> 53:56.253
Go home to who?

53:58.461 --> 54:00.107
What did you say?

54:03.937 --> 54:05.935
What do you know
about my wife, Alison?

54:06.012 --> 54:07.212
I met her, you asshole.

54:07.289 --> 54:08.252
You what?

54:09.087 --> 54:10.105
When?

54:10.552 --> 54:12.261
Last week at your office.

54:12.338 --> 54:13.860
Did you tell her about...

54:13.937 --> 54:16.297
No, but I will.
I swear.

54:16.374 --> 54:17.903
If you don't get out
of here right now.

54:17.980 --> 54:20.334
If you ever fucking
say anything to Heidi...

54:20.411 --> 54:21.838
So just leave, and I won't.

54:21.915 --> 54:24.243
And we never have to see
each other again, okay?

54:30.419 --> 54:32.524
You seduced me.

54:32.612 --> 54:35.196
I told you I was sober.

54:35.273 --> 54:36.590
- Ben.
- I told you I couldn't

54:36.667 --> 54:39.225
get involved with anyone,
but you wouldn't leave me alone.

54:39.302 --> 54:40.177
That's not true.

54:40.254 --> 54:41.816
- I didn't want this.
- Yes, you did.

54:41.893 --> 54:44.009
I'm fucking drinking again
because of you.

54:44.348 --> 54:46.925
Why don't you admit
what you are, huh?

54:48.026 --> 54:49.148
What I am?

54:49.258 --> 54:50.596
You broke up
two marriages.

54:50.673 --> 54:52.681
What, that wasn't
enough for you?

54:53.783 --> 54:55.897
Say this is your fault.

54:57.401 --> 54:58.957
And then I'll leave.

55:04.156 --> 55:06.287
I don't owe you a thing.

55:06.817 --> 55:08.188
You're an adult.

55:08.705 --> 55:10.415
I didn't seduce you.

55:10.721 --> 55:13.925
And even if I did, I'm allowed
to change my fucking mind.

55:14.002 --> 55:15.305
Now, get the fuck out
of my house

55:15.382 --> 55:16.962
before I call your fucking wife.

56:15.294 --> 56:17.200
<i>What are you gonna do, Ben?</i>

56:19.148 --> 56:20.972
<i>You gonna kill me?</i>

56:21.829 --> 56:23.861
<i>You think that scares me?</i>

56:26.068 --> 56:27.599
<i>My son died.</i>

56:28.960 --> 56:31.042
<i>He died in my fucking arms.</i>

56:37.073 --> 56:39.337
<i>So, what in God's name
do you think you can do to me</i>

56:39.414 --> 56:41.081
<i>that I haven't done
to myself...</i>

56:42.585 --> 56:44.102
<i>a million times?</i>

56:47.375 --> 56:50.606
<i>I have been in pain
my entire life.</i>

56:52.710 --> 56:54.207
<i>And maybe that's
what makes people</i>

56:54.284 --> 56:55.814
<i>think that I'm weak.</i>

56:57.054 --> 56:59.227
<i>And maybe that
makes people treat me</i>

56:59.304 --> 57:03.913
<i>like some sort of receptacle
for all their grief and rage.</i>

57:05.835 --> 57:07.696
<i>And disappointment.</i>

57:10.085 --> 57:12.494
<i>But I am fucking sick of it.</i>

57:17.255 --> 57:19.812
<i>I just want to live
a different life.</i>

57:20.900 --> 57:23.679
<i>I want to live
a different story.</i>

57:24.352 --> 57:26.075
<i>I'm still young.</i>

57:27.668 --> 57:29.391
<i>I can be someone else.</i>

57:29.468 --> 57:31.517
<i>Someone who deserves love.</i>

57:34.218 --> 57:36.341
<i>Someone who can be happy.</i>
