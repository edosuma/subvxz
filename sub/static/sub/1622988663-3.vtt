Okay.
When you walk in,

just, uh, maybe
throw it away more.

Todd.
What are you doing?

18:52.512 --> 18:54.214
"Dearest Prudence,

18:54.314 --> 18:56.977
You are my best friend.

18:57.077 --> 18:59.459
"But you're so much more
than that.

18:59.559 --> 19:01.722
"You're the most amazing
woman I've ever met.

19:02.963 --> 19:05.265
"This journey
is changing us all

19:05.365 --> 19:07.367
in ways we can't pr--"

19:08.729 --> 19:10.791
Pr--

19:10.891 --> 19:12.032
Predict.

19:12.132 --> 19:13.514
"But I promise

19:13.614 --> 19:15.716
"I will always
be by your side.

19:15.816 --> 19:17.998
[mouths words]
I love you."

19:18.098 --> 19:20.241
[chuckles]

19:20.341 --> 19:21.402
Todd.

19:21.502 --> 19:23.004
That was beautiful.

19:23.104 --> 19:25.206
I had no idea
you felt that way.

19:25.306 --> 19:27.308
Me neither.

19:28.829 --> 19:29.650
JOHN:
We got a buffalo!

19:29.750 --> 19:32.814
[cheers and applause]

19:32.914 --> 19:35.216
Oh, man. It's a good thing
you and Prude

19:35.316 --> 19:37.218
are just friends or
this would really sting.

19:37.318 --> 19:39.801
Yeah. Good thing.

19:42.804 --> 19:43.705
We are gathered together

19:43.805 --> 19:45.026
to mourn
the death of Lionel,

19:45.126 --> 19:47.348
who bravely
sacrificed himself...

19:47.448 --> 19:49.531
Reverend?
Tell us how he died.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.153
Oh, no, I'm--

19:52.253 --> 19:54.316
I'm not sure
that's a great idea.

19:54.416 --> 19:55.637
It would bring me peace

19:55.737 --> 19:57.739
to know how my husband
spent his final moments.

19:58.820 --> 20:00.822
Very well, then.

20:01.703 --> 20:04.606
Lionel was attacked...

20:04.706 --> 20:07.489
by not one,
but two bears...

20:07.589 --> 20:11.093
- [wife cries]
- who ate him alive

20:11.193 --> 20:15.257
as one might
an extra-long chili dog.

20:15.357 --> 20:16.698
[sobs]

20:16.798 --> 20:18.620
- I can stop.
- No, please.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.622
It's helping.

20:20.722 --> 20:22.724
[softly] Okay.

20:23.245 --> 20:25.187
At a certain point,
the bears became bored

20:25.287 --> 20:28.190
of eating Lionel,
and engaged in a game

20:28.290 --> 20:31.353
of what can
only be described as...

20:31.453 --> 20:32.915
bear volleyball.

20:33.015 --> 20:35.918
[sobs] Go on.

20:36.018 --> 20:38.281
- Please don't make me.
- Please.

20:38.381 --> 20:39.922
You owe me this.

20:40.022 --> 20:42.405
That is when things
got "bad,"

20:42.505 --> 20:45.328
as the bears proceeded
to place Lionel's head

20:45.428 --> 20:48.331
into a sort of...
bear cannon.

20:48.431 --> 20:51.294
[wails]

20:51.394 --> 20:53.977
Start again
from the top.

20:54.077 --> 20:56.299
But this time
more detail.

20:56.399 --> 20:58.401
