WEBVTT

00:06.708 --> 00:08.917
MOM, I GOT IT.

00:08.917 --> 00:12.000
[GASPS]
IT'S--IT'S
A HAIR BALL.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.750
I'M SORRY.
I JUST THOUGHT

00:13.750 --> 00:15.458
YOU MIGHT
LIKE TO KNOW
THE TUB IS FIXED.

00:15.458 --> 00:16.667
OH, THANKS, HONEY,

00:16.667 --> 00:18.166
BUT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,

00:18.166 --> 00:20.917
I DO NOT NEED
TO SEE THE OFFENDING
CLOGGING OBJECT.

00:20.917 --> 00:23.583
I'M SORRY. UM, SO,
TUB IS FIXED.

00:23.583 --> 00:24.667
I PAID ALL THE BILLS
FOR NEXT MONTH.

00:24.667 --> 00:26.083
UH, WHAT ELSE?

00:26.083 --> 00:27.583
OH, I COULD GET,
UH, LILY A NEW PACIFIER.

00:27.583 --> 00:28.792
SHE CHEWED THE LAST ONE
PRETTY GOOD.

00:28.792 --> 00:30.333
SWEETIE, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A BREAK?

00:30.333 --> 00:33.708
I DON'T NEED A BREAK.
JUST TELL ME WHAT
NEEDS TO GET DONE.

00:33.708 --> 00:35.667
NO, NO, NOTHING
NEEDS TO GET DONE.
THAT'S JUST IT.

00:35.667 --> 00:36.291
I DON'T
NEED YOU TO DO
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.000
OK.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.208
SO, WHAT ABOUT TAKING
JOEY UP ON HER OFFER?

00:44.208 --> 00:45.166
SHE'S BEEN CALLING HERE
ALMOST EVERY DAY

00:45.166 --> 00:47.458
ASKING YOU
TO GO SEE HER.

00:47.458 --> 00:48.375
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S, YOU KNOW,

00:48.375 --> 00:50.708
IT'S JUST BEEN
SO HECTIC AROUND HERE,

00:50.708 --> 00:55.792
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT I'M FORGETTING TO DO
THAT I NEED TO DO.

00:55.792 --> 00:58.750
HONEY...I'M OK.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.166
YOU CAN GO AWAY FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

01:00.166 --> 01:00.708
I WILL NOT
FALL APART.

01:00.708 --> 01:04.375
SO, GO TO BOSTON,

01:04.375 --> 01:05.625
SEE YOUR FRIENDS,

01:05.625 --> 01:07.250
AND LILY AND I
WILL BE RIGHT HERE
WHEN YOU COME BACK.

01:18.583 --> 01:19.875
[SIGHS]

02:18.625 --> 02:23.458
SO, EVERY MORNING WHEN
YOU GO OUT FOR A JOG,
YOU'RE ACTUALLY--

02:23.458 --> 02:24.542
JOGGING, YES.

02:24.542 --> 02:26.458
YOU'RE NOT
JUST DITCHING ME
TO GO HAVE SOME

02:26.458 --> 02:28.834
ICED CAP FRAPPY
THING FOR YOURSELF?

02:28.834 --> 02:30.792
NOPE.
I MEAN,
DID YOU REALIZE

02:30.792 --> 02:31.917
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
SIGNED ON

02:31.917 --> 02:33.125
FOR THIS LITTLE
BONDING SESSION

02:33.125 --> 02:35.583
IF I THOUGHT
THAT THERE WAS REAL
EXERCISE INVOLVED?

02:38.250 --> 02:41.125
MUST...SIT.

02:41.125 --> 02:44.458
OK. OK, WELL,
LET'S REVIEW.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.625
HE'S GONNA SHOW UP
AROUND 1:00.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.542
WE'LL WATCH MOVIES.
WE'LL ORDER
SOME PIZZA.

02:48.542 --> 02:50.166
IT'LL JUST
BE ME AND HIM.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.125
NO PRESSURE AT ALL.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.708
I'LL KEEP EVERYTHING
VERY LOW KEY.

02:52.708 --> 02:54.500
LOW KEY DOESN'T
GENERALLY INVOLVE

02:54.500 --> 02:57.125
SUCH A CAREFULLY PLANNED
ITINERARY, BUT WHATEVER.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.458
YEAH, BUT I'M JUST
PLANNING IT OUT

02:58.458 --> 03:00.000
IN CASE THINGS DO
GET WEIRD, YOU KNOW?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.458
I MEAN,
THERE'S A PLAN THERE
WAITING FOR ME.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.417
NO THINKING
ON MY FEET REQUIRED.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.417
I SHOULD PROBABLY
ORDER THE MOVIES
BEFORE HE GETS HERE

03:04.417 --> 03:05.417
JUST IN CASE
HE DOESN'T WANNA
GO OUT.

03:05.417 --> 03:06.625
THAT'S PROBABLY
A BETTER IDEA,
RIGHT?

03:06.625 --> 03:09.333
WHAT ARE YOU
SO NERVOUS ABOUT?
IT'S JUST DAWSON.

03:09.333 --> 03:12.000
YOU GUYS HAVE, LIKE,
KNOWN EACH OTHER

03:12.000 --> 03:13.875
SINCE YOU WERE PLACENTA.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.917
EXACTLY. IT'S DAWSON...

03:15.917 --> 03:17.208
MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD

03:17.208 --> 03:19.458
WHO NEEDS ME RIGHT NOW
MORE THAN HE PROBABLY
EVER HAS,

03:19.458 --> 03:20.708
AND THAT'S A LOT
OF PRESSURE, YOU KNOW?

03:20.708 --> 03:23.417
WHAT IF I MESS UP
AND I SAY ALL
OF THE WRONG THINGS,

03:23.417 --> 03:25.500
AND AT THE END
OF THE DAY...

03:25.500 --> 03:27.000
I'M NOT ENOUGH?

03:27.000 --> 03:31.417
OK, SO, YOU HAVE A SMIDGE
OF PERFORMANCE ANXIETY.

03:31.417 --> 03:34.333
NO BIG THING. I'VE SEEN IT
A COUPLE TIMES MYSELF.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.458
IT'S NOT THAT.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.750
I'M NOT AFRAID I'M GONNA
BOTCH UP MY LINES

03:37.750 --> 03:38.875
FOR SOME STUPID PLAY.

03:38.875 --> 03:40.000
I'M AFRAID
I'M GONNA BOTCH UP

03:40.000 --> 03:42.458
MY ENTIRE FUTURE
WITH THE ONLY...

03:42.458 --> 03:43.917
I'M JUST...

03:45.708 --> 03:48.750
I WANT HIM TO HAVE
A REALLY RELAXING
GOOD WEEKEND.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.708
WELL...

03:50.708 --> 03:53.333
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
UNTIL HE GETS HERE,

03:53.333 --> 03:55.875
AND THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO?

03:55.875 --> 03:56.834
THAT'S PUTTING
HIM ON THE SPOT.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.834
MAKING DECISIONS
IS STRESSFUL, AND I...

03:59.834 --> 04:00.792
I JUST DON'T
WANT HIM TO FEEL

04:00.792 --> 04:02.625
ANY STRESS
OF ANY KIND, YOU KNOW?

04:02.625 --> 04:04.458
SO, YOU'RE NOT PLANNING
ON BRINGING UP THE WHOLE--

04:04.458 --> 04:07.000
NO. NO. GOD NO.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.708
I--I'M NOT GONNA
BRING UP THE KISS.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.834
I'M NOT GONNA BRING UP
THE WHOLE MOVING
TO BOSTON THING.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.000
THERE'LL BE NO TALKING
WHATSOEVER.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.667
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A PARTY.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.208
ALL PARTIES
ARE STRESSFUL.

04:16.208 --> 04:19.541
Wilder: JOEY POTTER.
JUST THE GIRL
I WAS LOOKIN' FOR.

04:19.541 --> 04:21.625
HEY.
QUICK. ROSE LAZARE.

04:21.625 --> 04:25.208
UH, FAMOUS DEAD WRITER
FROM THE TWENTIES

04:25.208 --> 04:26.792
LIKE DOROTHY PARKER
BUT NOT?

04:26.792 --> 04:27.792
YES. DING,
DING, DING.

04:27.792 --> 04:29.250
ROSE LAZAR'S
HUSBAND.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.834
MR. LAZAR?

04:30.834 --> 04:33.041
YES, AND ALSO DEAD.
JUST DIED IN FACT.
WHICH MEANS...

04:33.041 --> 04:34.125
WE'RE VERY SAD?

04:34.125 --> 04:37.375
NO. I MEAN, YES,
BUT NO.

04:37.375 --> 04:38.250
IT MEANS THE ESTATE
OF ROSE LAZARE

04:38.250 --> 04:40.708
NO LONGER BELONGS
TO HER SPOUSE

04:40.708 --> 04:41.583
BUT TO
THE ESTABLISHMENT

04:41.583 --> 04:43.917
WHICH IT WAS WILLED
TO WHICH IS...

04:43.917 --> 04:45.583
PLEASE STOP THIS.

04:45.583 --> 04:46.834
WORTHINGTON. DID
YOU KNOW SHE WENT HERE?

04:46.834 --> 04:50.083
WELL, SHE DID. ANYWAY,
THE REAL NEWS IS THAT

04:50.083 --> 04:52.166
I HAVE BEEN CHOSEN
OUT OF ALL
THE DEPARTMENT HEADS

04:52.166 --> 04:53.834
TO INVENTORY HER ESTATE.

04:53.834 --> 04:57.875
WOW. CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S...

04:59.291 --> 05:01.375
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.959
IT MEANS THAT EVERYTHING
SHE'S EVER WRITTEN,

05:02.959 --> 05:04.500
HER UNPUBLISHED WORKS,
BOOKS SHE NEVER
FINISHED,

05:04.500 --> 05:07.291
SHORT STORIES
NO ONE HAS EVER READ,

05:07.291 --> 05:08.708
WE GET TO GO
THROUGH IT ALL

05:08.708 --> 05:09.792
AND HOPEFULLY
FIND A HIDDEN GEM
WORTH PUBLISHING.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.667
WE?

05:11.667 --> 05:12.750
I'M PUTTING
TOGETHER A TEAM.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.208
5 STUDENTS TO HELP
WITH THE SIFTING,

05:14.208 --> 05:16.166
THE CATALOGUING,
THE FILING,

05:16.166 --> 05:18.250
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
PART OF THAT TEAM.
SAY YES.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.458
YES. YES, DEFINITELY.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.125
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
I--I...

05:21.125 --> 05:23.208
GOD, I WOULD LOVE TO.

05:23.208 --> 05:25.041
GREAT. GREAT.
I'M GONNA
HAVE A PARTY

05:25.041 --> 05:26.458
AT MY HOUSE
TOMORROW NIGHT
TO CELEBRATE.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.208
UH, YOU'LL MEET
THE REST
OF THE TEAM.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.750
OH, WAIT. I, UM...

05:30.750 --> 05:33.083
I CAN'T TOMORROW NIGHT.
I HAVE A FRIEND
COMING INTO TOWN.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.000
BRING HER.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.125
HIM, AND I WOULD,
BUT...

05:36.125 --> 05:37.166
HE JUST HAD A DEATH
IN THE FAMILY,

05:37.166 --> 05:38.000
AND I DON'T THINK
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.083
YOU'RE OFF THE TEAM.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.834
WHAT?
KIDDING. YOU'RE
STILL ON THE TEAM,

05:41.834 --> 05:43.542
BUT TRY TO MAKE IT.
I'M SERVING BRIE.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.125
[LAUGHS]
I LOVE BRIE.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.041
I'M ON A TEAM?

05:47.041 --> 05:49.875
YOU THINK IT'S TOO LATE
TO TRANSFER INTO HIS CLASS?

05:49.875 --> 05:52.250
COME ON.
HE'S HOT!

05:52.250 --> 05:55.208
NO, I CAN'T.
YES, YOU CAN.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.959
[STRUMS GUITAR]

06:02.959 --> 06:04.792
HMM. IS THAT YOUR ELBOW?

06:04.792 --> 06:06.750
BECAUSE THAT'S--
THAT'S KINDA
DIGGING INTO ME.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.542
IT'S CALLED ROLFING.
A MORE INTENSE
VERSION OF MASSAGE,

06:09.542 --> 06:12.500
BUT HEY, YOU KNOW,
I CAN STOP IF YOU WANT.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.792
NO, NO, IT'S JUST
THAT I PREFER

06:14.792 --> 06:16.667
THE TRADITIONAL
SWEDISH MASSAGE.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.542
IT FEELS GOOD.
NO ELBOWS NECESSARY.

06:18.542 --> 06:19.708
RIGHT.

06:19.708 --> 06:23.041
[STRUMS]
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TOMORROW NIGHT?

06:23.041 --> 06:25.000
I'M WORKIN'
AT THE STATION. WHY?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.667
DAMN. I WANTED YOU TO GO
SEE THIS PLAY WITH ME.

06:27.667 --> 06:31.166
IT'S A REQUIREMENT
FOR ONE OF MY CLASSES.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.667
WELL, I'M SORRY...

06:32.667 --> 06:36.125
BUT IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN COME
BY AFTERWARDS

06:36.125 --> 06:37.208
AND REENACT
ALL THE GOOD PARTS
FOR ME...

06:37.208 --> 06:38.208
NAKED, OF COURSE.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.166
MMM, YEAH, OF COURSE.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.834
I'M SURE THAT SHAKESPEARE
ALWAYS INTENDED

06:41.834 --> 06:43.333
TO HAVE HIS WORK
PERFORMED IN THE FLESH.

06:43.333 --> 06:44.333
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
[STRUMS]

06:44.333 --> 06:45.375
HE KNEW IT WAS
THE ONLY WAY

06:45.375 --> 06:47.083
HE WAS GONNA KEEP
HIS AUDIENCE AWAKE

06:47.083 --> 06:48.750
DURING ALL THOSE
DRAGGY SPEECHES.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.542
THOSE "DRAGGY SPEECHES"
AS YOU CALL THEM

06:51.542 --> 06:53.333
ACTUALLY HAPPEN
TO BE QUITE BEAUTIFUL.

06:53.333 --> 06:56.333
NOT HALF
AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU.

06:56.333 --> 07:00.625
MMM. NICE SAVE,
CHEESEBALL.

07:00.625 --> 07:05.917
OH. IS THAT--IS THAT
PART OF THE ROLFING?

07:05.917 --> 07:08.000
BECAUSE I LIKE THAT.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.375
MM-HMM.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.667
Danny: YOU'RE NOT
USING YOUR WRIST.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.583
I AM USING MY WRIST.
JUST SHOW ME AGAIN.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.291
ME DOING IT FOR YOU
IS NOT GOING TO TEACH
YOU ANYTHING.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.333
WHY WON'T YOU
JUST SHOW ME WHAT
I'M DOIN' WRONG?

07:25.083 --> 07:26.250
Danny:
YOU GOTTA BOUNCE IT.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.083
YOU'RE MY HERO.
YOU REALIZE THAT?

07:28.083 --> 07:29.583
YOU ARE MY HERO.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.333
THAT'S GOOD, PACEY.
PACEY, THAT'S RIGHT.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.000
JUST KEEP
STIRRING THE SAUCE.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.166
NOW, STIR THE SAUCE.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.083
JUST SAVE IT. I CAN SMELL
THE MALE BONDING

07:36.083 --> 07:37.625
FROM BEHIND THE DOOR...

07:37.625 --> 07:39.250
AND THE ODOR IS PUNGENT.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.792
WELL, MAYBE THOSE WERE
JUST MY PHEROMONES
CALLIN' TO YOU.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.834
[LAUGHS]
MAYBE YOU NEED
A STRONGER DEODORANT.

[LAUGHS]

07:48.125 --> 07:50.667
OH, GOOD LUCK,

07:50.667 --> 07:52.291
I'VE SEEN BETTER MEN
TRY AND FAIL.

07:52.291 --> 07:56.125
AH, YES, BUT DID THEY
HAVE A 50-FOOT YACHT
TO LURE HER WITH?

07:56.125 --> 07:57.417
YOU SEE,
THAT MAKES ME FANCY.

07:57.417 --> 07:59.583
RIGHT, RIGHT.
I KEEP HEARIN' ABOUT
THIS FAMOUS BOAT.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.083
I MEAN, COMPARED
TO WHAT THEY USED
TO DO TO PLEDGES,

10:11.083 --> 10:12.250

TO BOND ALL
THE PLEDGES TOGETHER.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.333
I MEAN, AT LEAST THAT'S
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.

10:26.333 --> 10:27.834

YOU'RE HAVIN' FUN.

WELL, IT'S REALLY,
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.
I MEAN...

11:53.291 --> 11:54.708
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND
OF CONFUSING TO ME. I...

11:54.708 --> 11:56.792
NOT THAT YOU WOULD
BE CONFUSED BY IT.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.375

MEETING JACK AT NEWBURY.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.375

I THOUGHT SO TOO,

13:43.375 --> 13:45.208
BUT, UH,
HE'S NOT THERE.

13:45.208 --> 13:46.333

MAYBE I MESSED UP

13:46.333 --> 13:48.041
AND WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO MEET
BACK HERE FIRST,

13:48.041 --> 13:49.583
BUT I GUESS...

13:49.583 --> 13:52.667
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT HE FLAKED ON YOU
FOR THOSE FRAT MORONS.

13:52.667 --> 13:56.333
HE DIDN'T FLAKE ON ME.
HE'S JUST RUNNIN' LATE,
THAT'S ALL.

IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

13:57.041 --> 13:59.625
TOBEY,
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.834
YOU'RE HERE FOR ONE
WEEKEND. THE VERY LEAST
THAT HE COULD DO

14:01.834 --> 14:05.000
IS LOOSEN HIS GRIP
ON HIS BEER BONG
AND JUST BE ON TIME.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.375
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.041
HE HAD AN OBLIGATION,
AND I UNDERSTAND.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.959
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE'S OBSESSED.

14:11.959 --> 14:15.458
COME ON,
HE'S NOT OBSESSED.
HE'S HAPPY.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.333
HE IS TURNING
INTO A POD PERSON.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.125
[LAUGHS]
NO, COME ON.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.875

THE POD MENTALITY.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.125
TRUST ME.

14:24.583 --> 14:26.667
WELL, UM...

14:26.667 --> 14:28.208

14:46.041 --> 14:47.959
OK.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.959
Joey: YOU WANT
ANOTHER COKE?

14:53.959 --> 14:55.041
I CAN RUN DOWN
TO THE MACHINE.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.208
Dawson: NO, I'M GOOD.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.375
JUST CHECKING.

15:13.792 --> 15:16.417
COME ON.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.333
DAWSON, I AM SO SORRY.
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.875
THAT'S OK.
NO, I JUST--I--

15:24.875 --> 15:26.083
I WENT RIGHT
TO THE COMEDY SECTION

15:26.083 --> 15:28.625
WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING,
AND I...

15:28.625 --> 15:31.458
YOU MUST THINK
I'M THE MOST INSENSITIVE
IDIOT ON THE PLANET.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.417
I WOULD NEVER THINK THAT.

15:33.417 --> 15:36.792
NO, I--I'M FREAKING
OUT HERE.

15:36.792 --> 15:38.792
JOEY, IT'S OK.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.542
NO, IT'S--IT'S NOT
OK, DAWSON,

15:40.542 --> 15:42.083
BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR
TIME TO FREAK OUT,

15:42.083 --> 15:43.083
AND I'M TOTALLY
ROBBING YOU OF THAT

15:43.083 --> 15:44.875
BY MAKING THIS ABOUT
ME WHEN IT ISN'T,

15:44.875 --> 15:46.250
AND I KNOW THAT
IT ISN'T, AND--

15:46.250 --> 15:49.375
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU KNOW. SO...

15:49.375 --> 15:52.041
SEE? THERE YOU GO AGAIN.
YOU'RE DOING MY JOB.

15:52.041 --> 15:54.417
YOU KNOW, I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE THE ONE
MAKING YOU FEEL BETTER.

15:54.417 --> 15:56.500
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING ANYTHING.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.458
I JUST KINDA
WANTED TO MAKE THIS

15:57.458 --> 15:59.041
A REALLY FUN, RELAXING
WEEKEND FOR YOU.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.750
OH, MAYBE AUDREY
WAS RIGHT.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.000
MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE JUST GONE OUT.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.166
LET'S GO OUT.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.375
NOW?

16:08.375 --> 16:09.708
WHY NOT?

16:09.708 --> 16:13.291
OK, WELL, MY PROFESSOR
IS THROWING THIS THING
AT HIS HOUSE

16:13.291 --> 16:14.333
THAT COULD BE KINDA FUN.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.708
APPARENTLY,
THERE'S GONNA BE BRIE.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.291
OH, I LOVE BRIE.

16:19.291 --> 16:20.750
EVERYBODY DOES.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.125
[LAUGHS]

16:22.125 --> 16:23.542
OK...

16:23.542 --> 16:24.625
I'LL GRAB MY COAT.

16:24.625 --> 16:25.875
ALL RIGHT.

16:27.542 --> 16:30.875
[SIGHS]

16:30.875 --> 16:33.291
I'M TELLIN' YOU.
KAREN--SHE IS SMART.
SHE'S FEISTY.

16:33.291 --> 16:34.834
I CAN DEFINITELY FEEL
THE LOVE CONNECTION.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.792
OH, YEAH? IS SHE
FLIRTIN' WITH YOU?

16:36.792 --> 16:38.834
WELL, IF WE WERE
TO GO BACK

16:38.834 --> 16:41.208
TO THE THIRD GRADE
DEFINITION OF FLIRTING.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.500
HAIR PULLING, NAME CALLING,
GENERAL NASTINESS?

16:44.500 --> 16:45.917
YES, IF THAT'S
THE DEFINITION,

16:45.917 --> 16:47.166
THEN WE DEFINITELY
GOT IT GOIN' ON.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.208
GOD, I AM SO GLAD THAT
I'M NOT SINGLE ANYMORE.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.208
AND THEN, THERE'S DANNY.
I'M TELLING YOU,

16:52.208 --> 16:54.750
YOU COULD NOT CREATE
A MORE PERFECT BOSS.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.417
I THINK I FINALLY
FOUND MY MENTOR.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.959
THAT IS FANTASTIC, PACE.
WHAT'S HE LIKE?

16:58.959 --> 17:02.208
WELL, HE'S JUST
LIKE ME, ONLY OLDER.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.959
WAIT. YOUR MENTOR,
THE GUY WHO CAN SUPPOSEDLY

17:04.959 --> 17:05.875
GUIDE YOU THROUGH YOUR LIFE

17:05.875 --> 17:07.750
IS--IS JUST AN OLDER
VERSION OF YOU?

17:07.750 --> 17:09.834
YEP.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.416
SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
THAT WHEN YOU GROW UP,

17:11.416 --> 17:14.333
YOU BASICALLY
WANNA BE YOURSELF.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.208
YEAH. I'M VERY
WELL ADJUSTED.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.959
MY GOD.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.666
OH, MY GOD.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.375
ISN'T THAT
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

17:25.375 --> 17:26.916
YEAH.

17:26.916 --> 17:28.165
I THOUGHT HE WAS
WORKING TONIGHT.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.959
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.

17:32.959 --> 17:35.250
OH. WELL,
THAT'S FUNNY.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.333
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET OFF TO THE PLAY,
'CAUSE--

17:37.333 --> 17:40.291
NOW, JUST
WAIT A SECOND.
JUST HOLD ON.

17:40.291 --> 17:41.417
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

17:41.417 --> 17:42.750
I'M GONNA GO IN THERE
AND BEAT HIS ASS.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.166
EASY, THELMA.
NOW, YOU DON'T KNOW

17:44.166 --> 17:45.542
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, OK?
THAT DOES NOT--

17:45.542 --> 17:46.667
HE TOLD ME THAT
HE WAS WORKING.

17:46.667 --> 17:49.291
VOLUME,
PLEASE. VOLUME, OK?
NOW, OBVIOUSLY,

17:49.291 --> 17:51.959
THE 2 OF YOU HAVE HAD
A SLIGHT MISCOMMUNICATION,

17:51.959 --> 17:53.500
BUT YOU ARE FAR TOO UPSET
RIGHT NOW TO DEAL WITH IT,

17:53.500 --> 17:54.834
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST
GO TO THIS PLAY, WHICH,

17:54.834 --> 17:56.750
I MAY REMIND YOU,
IS A REQUIREMENT
OF YOUR SCHOOLING,

17:56.750 --> 17:57.917
AND THEN TOMORROW,

17:57.917 --> 17:59.083
YOU GIVE HIM A CALL,
HE EXPLAINS--

17:59.083 --> 18:01.625
WHAT SORT OF POSSIBLE--
VOLUME.

18:01.625 --> 18:04.166
MAYBE HE WON'T EXPLAIN,
BUT EITHER WAY,

18:04.166 --> 18:05.417
YOU'LL BE CALMER
AND MORE RATIONAL,

18:05.417 --> 18:08.500
AND ULTIMATELY, HAPPIER
THAT YOU WAITED BECAUSE

18:08.500 --> 18:12.250
WHEN YOU DO,
YOU'LL HAVE GAINED
THE UPPER HAND, OK?

18:12.250 --> 18:13.792
MMM. FINE.
GOOD.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.375
UNH! UNH!
SON OF A--

18:16.375 --> 18:17.917
LET ME
GO GET HIM!

18:17.917 --> 18:19.875
PUT ME DOWN!

18:36.375 --> 18:39.542
IS THIS HOW YOU'RE
GONNA BE ALL NIGHT?

18:39.542 --> 18:41.959
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

18:41.959 --> 18:44.333
I WANTED TO, BUT SINCE YOU
REFUSED TO BUY A CELL PHONE

18:44.333 --> 18:45.792
FOR REASONS I STILL
CAN'T UNDERSTAND...

18:45.792 --> 18:46.917
BRAIN TUMORS.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.083
[LAUGHS]
THE POINT IS THAT

18:50.083 --> 18:51.667
I HAD NO WAY
OF LETTING YOU KNOW

18:51.667 --> 18:53.458
THAT--THAT I WAS
GONNA BE LATE.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.583
OH, AND YOU
COULDN'T LEAVE
WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

18:55.583 --> 18:56.834
NO, I COULDN'T.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.917
WHY? WHAT WERE
YOU DOIN'?

18:58.917 --> 19:01.834
I, UH...

19:01.834 --> 19:02.500
I--I CAN'T--
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.959
IT'S PART OF THE RULES.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.125
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID,
BUT I JUST--

19:05.125 --> 19:06.041
WHATEVER.

19:06.041 --> 19:09.208
LOOK, DON'T DO THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

19:09.208 --> 19:12.542
DON'T--DON'T GET
ALL GIRLFRIENDY ON ME.

19:12.542 --> 19:13.834
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA PRETEND

19:13.834 --> 19:15.333
I DIDN'T HEAR
THAT LAST COMMENT.

19:15.333 --> 19:19.500
YEAH, SORRY.
I--I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.792
LET'S JUST NOT
SAY IT AGAIN, OK?

19:21.792 --> 19:24.458
OK.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.959
YOU, UH,
LOOK REALLY GREAT.

19:30.959 --> 19:32.166
REALLY?

19:33.333 --> 19:35.417
THANKS.

19:35.417 --> 19:38.250
I MISSED YOU.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.500
I MISS YOU, TOO.

21:01.959 --> 21:05.166

23:18.250 --> 23:20.542
THAT'S JUST

WHERE YOU BEEN

23:33.625 --> 23:35.375
AND WHAT ARE
YOU UP TO.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.125
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

23:37.125 --> 23:39.417
DUDE, MY GIRLFRIEND
IS THE SAME WAY.

23:39.417 --> 23:42.458

23:53.542 --> 23:55.583
HE'S PRETENDING
THIS IS SOME
SWEET MOVE,

23:55.583 --> 23:57.333
WHEN REALLY
IT'S A HOSTILE
TAKEOVER.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.083
THANK YOU.
IF HE CARED,

23:59.083 --> 24:00.417
HE WOULD HAVE
CALLED FIRST,

24:00.417 --> 24:01.792
MADE SURE
THE TIMING
WAS RIGHT,

24:01.792 --> 24:03.000
THEN BOOKED
THE FLIGHT.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.667
WELL, MAYBE HE JUST
WANTED TO SURPRISE ME.

24:04.667 --> 24:06.458
WHAT KIND OF WEAK-ASS
MOVE WAS THAT?

24:06.458 --> 24:09.375
HE SAID, "OH, HEY,
SURPRISE. HERE I AM."

24:09.375 --> 24:11.083
NOW, YOU GOTTA SPEND
ALL YOUR TIME WITH ME,

24:11.083 --> 24:12.166

WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

24:14.583 --> 24:16.291
THAT HE CAME OUT HERE
TO CHECK UP ON ME?
THERE'S NO WAY.

24:16.291 --> 24:17.834
HE'S A CLEVER DUDE, MAN.

24:17.834 --> 24:22.750
HE IS WELL AWARE
OF THE HOT GUY QUOTIENT
AT THIS CAMPUS.

24:22.750 --> 24:23.792

TOBEY DOESN'T KNOW

24:23.792 --> 24:26.625

WITH YOUR LIFE.

24:31.750 --> 24:33.583
PLENTY OF OTHER FISH
IN THE SEA, DUDE.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.750
IT'S TIME
TO GO SWIMMIN'.

24:35.750 --> 24:38.417
BE THE SHARK.

24:48.041 --> 24:49.000

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
YOU WANT A GLASS
OF WINE OR SOMETHING?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.792
NO.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.917
ACTUALLY,
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT
BOTTLE OF WATER?

24:54.917 --> 24:56.125
OH, HERE. TAKE MINE.

24:56.125 --> 24:57.500
DON'T WORRY. I HAVE
NO GERMS TO SPEAK OF.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.250
I LISTERINE, LIKE,
5 TIMES A DAY.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.458
I'M TOTALLY ADDICTED.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.500
SO, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
DO YOU GO TO WORTHINGTON?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.834
NO, I'M SORRY--
IS IT WARM IN HERE?

25:06.834 --> 25:08.500
I'M--I'M REALLY WARM.
ARE YOU WARM?

25:08.500 --> 25:09.667
YOU WANT ME
TO OPEN A WINDOW?

25:09.667 --> 25:11.542
YEAH, THAT WOULD
BE GREAT. THANK YOU.

25:21.375 --> 25:22.333
I'M SORRY.
WE HAVE TO GO.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.000
IS EVERYTHING OK?
I'M FINE.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.417
OH, PROFESSOR
WILDER, THIS IS--

25:25.417 --> 25:28.000
I'M SORRY. I HAVE
TO GO RIGHT NOW.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.792
UH,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

25:45.083 --> 25:47.625
DAWSON, WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:47.625 --> 25:49.500
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST--
I COULDN'T STAY IN THAT HOUSE

25:49.500 --> 25:51.041
FOR ANOTHER SECOND.
I'M SORRY.

25:51.041 --> 25:54.583
THAT'S FINE, IT'S JUST
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
WANTED TO GO OUT.

25:54.583 --> 25:57.208
I KNOW. I KNOW.

26:05.834 --> 26:08.041
THE OTHER DAY I WAS--

26:08.041 --> 26:10.166
I WAS IN THE GROCERY STORE,
JUST WAITING IN LINE,

26:10.166 --> 26:11.750
AND I COULDN'T WAIT ANYMORE.

26:11.750 --> 26:14.041
THERE WERE ONLY 2 PEOPLE
IN FRONT OF ME, AND I JUST--

26:14.041 --> 26:16.291
I KNEW IF IT DIDN'T
GET OUT OF THE STORE
THAT SECOND,

26:16.291 --> 26:17.625
I FELT LIKE I WAS
GONNA EXPLODE.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.375
IT'S JUST
THE WEIRDEST FEELING.

26:20.375 --> 26:24.542
IT'S LIKE A TOTAL,
COMPLETE LOSS OF CONTROL.

26:24.542 --> 26:28.083
BUT YOU DIDN'T LOSE IT.
YOU HELD IT IN AND YOU
WALKED OUT.

26:28.083 --> 26:31.250
YEAH, BUT I HATE NOT KNOWING
WHERE THAT FEELING CAME FROM.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.041
I MEAN, IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST THIS RANDOM EMOTION.

26:33.041 --> 26:36.875
IT JUST COMPLETELY
BLINDSIDED ME
OUT OF NOWHERE.

26:36.875 --> 26:39.625
IS THAT HOW YOU FELT
TONIGHT?

26:39.625 --> 26:39.875
YEAH.

26:42.917 --> 26:44.208
I WANTED TO GO OUT.

26:44.208 --> 26:46.667
I DID. I WANTED TO GET OUT.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.625
BUT AS SOON AS WE WALKED--
THE SECOND WE WALKED
THROUGH THAT DOOR,

26:48.625 --> 26:49.750
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE OUT ANYMORE.

26:49.750 --> 26:53.000
I JUST, LIKE,
CHANGED MY MIND.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.333
I JUST COMPLETELY
CHANGED MY MIND
FOR NO GOOD REASON.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.417
LISTEN, THAT'S ALLOWED.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.834
IT'S ALLOWED.

27:05.083 --> 27:09.083
I KNOW, BUT IT WAS,
LIKE, A MILLION DEGREES
IN THERE, TOO, RIGHT?

27:09.083 --> 27:10.417
I MEAN IT WAS HOT
IN THERE, RIGHT?

27:10.417 --> 27:13.792
YEAH. IT WAS.

27:13.792 --> 27:16.834
YEAH. I MEAN, THAT DID--
THAT DIDN'T HELP.

27:18.291 --> 27:20.083
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
YOU'RE GETTING SICK.
FLU'S GOING AROUND.

27:20.083 --> 27:23.750
YEAH.

27:23.750 --> 27:26.875
YEAH, THAT--
THAT'S PROBABLY IT.
IT'S...

27:29.834 --> 27:32.667
WOULD YOU MIND IF WE JUST
WENT BACK TO THE DORMS?

27:32.667 --> 27:33.834
NO. THAT'S FINE.

27:35.333 --> 27:35.875
GREAT.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.792
SO, I SAW YOU
HOLDING HER HAND,

27:46.792 --> 27:48.500
AND I DON'T KNOW,
I--I JUST--

27:48.500 --> 27:50.917
I WAS LOOKING
AT HER ENGAGEMENT RING.

27:52.083 --> 27:55.208
OH, WOW. SHE GOT ENGAGED?
THAT'S SO NICE.

27:55.208 --> 27:58.125
YEAH. I'LL BE SURE
TO CONGRATULATE HER
FOR YOU.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.542
OK, LOOK.
IN ALL FAIRNESS--

27:59.542 --> 28:01.000
NOT THAT I DESERVE
FAIRNESS OF ANY KIND--

28:01.000 --> 28:03.625
BUT--BUT YOU DID TELL ME
THAT YOU WOULD BE WORKING.

28:03.625 --> 28:05.834
MY SHIFT
GOT SWITCHED, ALL RIGHT?
I WAS GONNA CALL YOU,

28:05.834 --> 28:07.208
BUT I KNEW THAT YOU'D
BE AT THE PLAY.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.875
THEN MY SISTER CALLED ME
AND TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD
BIG NEWS.

28:08.875 --> 28:14.542
AND THE REST...
WELL, IT'S ON MY PANTS.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.875
I CAN WASH THOSE
FOR YOU.

28:16.875 --> 28:19.750
IN FACT, I COULD
DO YOUR LAUNDRY
FOR A WEEK.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.834
A MONTH. A MONTH.
I CAN DO YOUR LAUNDRY
FOR A WHOLE MONTH.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.250
HOW'S THAT
FOR AN APOLOGY?

28:24.250 --> 28:26.000
THAT'S A START.

28:30.834 --> 28:34.625
I SCREWED UP. I'M SORRY.

28:34.625 --> 28:41.375
LISTEN, JEN, YOU HAVE
TO LEARN TO TRUST ME.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.917
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT,
ALL RIGHT? WHAT IF I
WOULD HAVE SEEN YOU

28:43.917 --> 28:46.792
WITH YOUR FRIEND PACEY?

28:46.792 --> 28:50.291
WOULD IT HAVE BEEN COOL
FOR ME TO JUST JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS?

28:50.291 --> 28:50.959
NO.

28:50.959 --> 28:54.417
NO. AND I WOULDN'T HAVE.

28:54.417 --> 28:56.542
WHY?
BECAUSE I TRUST YOU.

28:56.542 --> 29:01.750
BECAUSE I REALIZE
THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL HERE.

29:01.750 --> 29:05.708
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY,
100% RIGHT.

29:05.708 --> 29:09.542
OF COURSE I'M RIGHT.
I'M ALWAYS RIGHT.

29:09.542 --> 29:12.917
HMM. GONNA LET
THAT ONE SLIDE,

29:12.917 --> 29:14.625
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
YOU HAVE WHIPPED CREAM
ON YOUR CROTCH.

29:14.625 --> 29:20.333
YEAH, YEAH.
COME HERE. COME HERE.

29:20.333 --> 29:22.208
I'M SORRY.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.291
I AM SO SORRY.

29:43.291 --> 29:46.083
FORGET IT, JACK.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.083
NO, LISTEN. WE WERE--

29:47.083 --> 29:49.208
I SAID I DON'T CARE!
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT!

29:50.750 --> 29:53.125
HOW CAN I MAKE
THIS BETTER, HUH?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.834
HUH?

29:55.834 --> 29:58.458
COME ON.

29:59.792 --> 30:02.708
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

30:02.708 --> 30:04.792
I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

30:04.792 --> 30:06.750
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY
THAT YOUR FRATERNITY

30:06.750 --> 30:09.542
IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU
THAN I AM.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.083
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

30:11.083 --> 30:13.375
IT'S JUST NOT
THAT EASY, TOBEY.

30:13.375 --> 30:14.291
YOU'RE HERE
FOR ONE WEEKEND.

30:14.291 --> 30:16.083
I'M--I'M HERE
FOR 4 YEARS.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.500
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE
TOMORROW?

30:18.500 --> 30:20.291
HUH? WAIT AROUND
TILL I CAN SCRAPE UP
SOME MONEY

30:20.291 --> 30:24.208
TO GO SEE YOU? WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
FOR HOW LONG?

30:24.208 --> 30:27.166
UNTIL--I DON'T KNOW!

30:27.166 --> 30:32.041
LOOK, I NEED TO DEVELOP
A SOCIAL LIFE HERE,
ALL RIGHT? AND I HAVE.

30:32.041 --> 30:34.125
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

30:34.125 --> 30:37.583
I'M DOING IT WHILE
BEING HONEST AND--
AND OPEN ABOUT WHO I AM.

30:37.583 --> 30:40.333
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO COMPARTMENTALIZE
MYSELF TO ANYONE

30:40.333 --> 30:41.917
TO MAKE IT EASIER
ON THEM.

30:41.917 --> 30:44.083
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.959
WHEN I FIRST MOVED
TO CAPESIDE,

30:51.959 --> 30:54.834
OK, EVERYONE
GOT TO KNOW ME
AS ANDIE'S BROTHER.

30:54.834 --> 30:57.333
AND THEN IT WAS
JOEY'S ARTIST BOYFRIEND.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.333
AND THEN I
TOLD EVERYONE
I WAS GAY,

30:59.333 --> 31:00.792
AND SUDDENLY,
FOR THE REST
OF HIGH SCHOOL,

31:00.792 --> 31:01.917
THAT'S ALL I WAS.
JACK, THE GAY GUY.

31:01.917 --> 31:04.041
THAT IS NOT ALL
THAT YOU WERE TO THEM.

31:04.041 --> 31:06.917
WELL, MAYBE NOT,
BUT THAT'S HOW IT FELT.

31:06.917 --> 31:09.291
SO, WHEN SIGMA EPSILON
ASKED ME TO PLEDGE,

31:09.291 --> 31:11.834
I WANTED TO TELL THEM
THE TRUTH UP FRONT, OK?

31:11.834 --> 31:13.792
RIGHT AWAY, SO I DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO THROUGH
ALL THAT AGAIN.

31:13.792 --> 31:18.333
LOOK, THE AMAZING THING
WAS THAT THESE GUYS
ALREADY KNEW,

31:18.333 --> 31:20.041
AND THEY DIDN'T CARE,
ALL RIGHT?

31:20.041 --> 31:21.834
THEY WANTED ME
TO JOIN THEIR FRATERNITY

31:21.834 --> 31:24.208
KNOWING EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW
ABOUT ME.

31:24.208 --> 31:26.250
TOBEY, THEY WANTED ME.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.875
SO NOW I JUST GET
TO BE JACK.

31:28.875 --> 31:30.500
NO LABELS.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.667
I MEAN, I THOUGHT YOU
OF ALL PEOPLE WOULD
UNDERSTAND

31:33.667 --> 31:36.166
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS
TO ME.

31:36.166 --> 31:38.000
GOD!

31:38.000 --> 31:39.125
I GUESS MAYBE
THEY WERE RIGHT.

31:42.834 --> 31:47.333
WHAT--THEY WHO?

31:47.333 --> 31:49.208
YOU TALKED
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH TOTAL STRANGERS?!

31:49.208 --> 31:50.708
NO, THEY'RE MY FRIENDS!

31:50.708 --> 31:52.250
YOU JUST MET THEM, JACK.

31:52.250 --> 31:55.792
MY GOD, JUST BECAUSE
THEY KNOW YOU'RE GAY
DOESN'T MEAN THEY KNOW YOU.

31:55.792 --> 31:58.708
AND THEY CERTAINLY
DON'T KNOW ME.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.750
HOW COULD YOU THINK
THAT THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND

32:00.750 --> 32:01.917
WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS ABOUT?

32:01.917 --> 32:03.083
WHOA, WHOA!
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS
ARE UNIVERSAL.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE GAY
TO UNDERSTAND

32:05.333 --> 32:06.875
THE CONCEPT
OF A JEALOUS BOYFRIEND!

32:06.875 --> 32:09.667
YOU THINK I'M JEALOUS
OF YOUR FRAT BUDDIES?

32:09.667 --> 32:12.250
IF THAT'S NOT IT,
THEN WHAT IS IT?

32:14.917 --> 32:16.708
I WANT TO BE A PRIORITY.

32:16.708 --> 32:18.250
YOU ARE.

32:18.250 --> 32:21.458
NO, NOT ONE
OF YOUR PRIORITIES.

32:21.458 --> 32:24.917
IT IS NOT ENOUGH
THAT I MAKE THE TOP 3.

32:24.917 --> 32:29.041
YOU COME FIRST TO ME.
NO MATTER WHAT I'M DOING,
OR--OR HOW FAR AWAY I AM,

32:29.041 --> 32:31.542
YOU ARE MY FIRST PRIORITY.

32:31.542 --> 32:32.750
I--I WONDER
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.458
I THINK ABOUT WAYS
THAT I CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH

32:34.458 --> 32:36.667
WITH A STUPID E-MAIL
OR A CARE PACKAGE.

32:36.667 --> 32:39.959
I THINK ABOUT YOU.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.166
GOD, WHEN I'M WITH YOU,
WHEN I AM NOT WITH YOU,

32:43.166 --> 32:45.500
NO MATTER WHAT IS
GOING ON IN MY LIFE,

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
YOU ARE MY FIRST PRIORITY.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.959
BUT...CLEARLY,
I AM NOT TO YOU.

32:49.959 --> 32:51.208
NOT ANYMORE.
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH,
ISN'T IT?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.625
AH, KAREN TORRES,
THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE.

33:14.625 --> 33:16.792
THE CHERRY FLAVORED
KOOL-AID IN MY CUP.

33:16.792 --> 33:17.875
MORNING, FREAK.

33:17.875 --> 33:19.208
HOW IS IT THAT
WE ALWAYS END UP

33:19.208 --> 33:20.792
WORKING THE SAME SHIFT
TOGETHER?

33:20.792 --> 33:23.333
YOU THINK IT'S FATE?
DESTINY WORKING
IN OUR FAVOR?

33:23.333 --> 33:26.333
OR COULD IT BE THE FACT
THAT YOU CHECK TO SEE
WHAT MY SHIFTS ARE

33:26.333 --> 33:27.750
BEFORE ASKING FOR YOURS?

33:27.750 --> 33:29.750
THAT IS A VERY CYNICAL WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.500
IT'S TRUE, BUT CYNICAL.

33:31.500 --> 33:36.375
AND SHE SMILES.
MY DAY IS MADE.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.834
DANNY'S NOT HERE YET?

33:41.834 --> 33:43.166
UH, NO, HE'S NOT.
MAY I--

33:43.166 --> 33:44.500
EMILY. DANNY'S WIFE.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.458
I'D SHAKE YOUR HAND,
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GET YOU SICK.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.417
I GUESS THAT MEANS
LAST NIGHT WASN'T
TOO MUCH FUN, HUH?

33:48.417 --> 33:50.417
NOT UNLESS YOU CALL
GOING THROUGH 8 BOXES
OF KLEENEX FUN.

33:50.417 --> 33:54.166
ANYWAY, DANNY LEFT HIS WALLET
HOME AGAIN, SO HERE.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.542
NICE MEETING YOU, PACEY.

33:55.542 --> 33:57.166
DANNY'S BEEN TALKING
ABOUT YOU NONSTOP.

33:57.166 --> 33:59.959
APPARENTLY, YOU'RE
HIS NEW FAVORITE.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.208
DON'T FORGET YOUR TOOTHBRUSH.

34:10.208 --> 34:12.250
IT'S IN THERE.

34:15.833 --> 34:18.083
JOEY, THANK YOU.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.125
FOR WHAT?

34:19.125 --> 34:21.208
FOR TAKING ME IN,
GETTING ME OUT.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.833
ALL EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY,

34:22.833 --> 34:24.500
YOU REALLY DID MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.041
I DID?

34:26.041 --> 34:26.667
YEAH.

34:26.667 --> 34:29.583
OF COURSE YOU DID.

34:32.875 --> 34:37.750
SO, I SHOULD GET GOING.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.208
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE WELCOME HERE
ANY TIME, DAWSON.

34:39.208 --> 34:43.375
ALL RIGHT. I'LL, UH--
I'LL CALL YOU SOON.

35:04.834 --> 35:06.208
I DON'T THINK
HE'S COMING, TOBEY.

35:06.208 --> 35:09.834
I KNOW. I JUST
CAN'T HELP LOOKING.

35:10.917 --> 35:14.417
WHAT IS THAT?

35:14.417 --> 35:15.834
WHAT IS WHAT?

35:15.834 --> 35:18.667
THAT STUPID FANTASY
YOU HAVE WHERE THE GUY
WHO BROKE YOUR HEART

35:18.667 --> 35:21.917
SUDDENLY REALIZES HE'S MADE
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS LIFE,

35:21.917 --> 35:24.250
AND HE FINDS YOU?
WHEREVER YOU ARE,

35:24.250 --> 35:28.667
HE COMES RUNNING
UP TO YOU, AND HE SAYS,
"I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

35:28.667 --> 35:31.458
"YOU ARE MY ENTIRE UNIVERSE,

35:31.458 --> 35:33.000
"AND IF YOU DON'T
TAKE ME BACK RIGHT NOW,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.041
I WILL NEVER
LOVE ANYONE AGAIN."

35:36.792 --> 35:38.125
WHERE'S THIS FANTASY
COME FROM?

35:38.125 --> 35:41.458
MOVIES.

35:41.458 --> 35:43.291
TELEVISION.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.792
AND THAT LITTLE PLACE
IN YOUR HEART

35:44.792 --> 35:47.542
THAT HARBORS HOPE.

35:49.250 --> 35:51.417
HE'S GONNA REGRET THIS,
YOU KNOW.

35:54.959 --> 35:56.000
YEAH, MAYBE.

35:57.125 --> 35:59.208
MAYBE NOT.

35:59.208 --> 36:01.166
THE THING IS,
WE TELL OURSELVES THAT

36:01.166 --> 36:04.291
TO MAKE OURSELVES
FEEL BETTER,

36:04.291 --> 36:07.875
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
SOMEBODY ALWAYS
GETS HURT WORSE...

36:07.875 --> 36:11.000
EVERY BREAKUP.
THIS TIME IT'S ME.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.417
[VAN DOOR SLAMS]

36:13.417 --> 36:16.125
COME HERE.

36:16.125 --> 36:17.792

36:17.792 --> 36:21.417
OH, HOLD ONTO THAT CHARLIE.

36:21.417 --> 36:22.792
HE SEEMS LIKE HE COULD
BE A GOOD EGG.

36:22.792 --> 36:25.583
I WILL.

36:29.917 --> 36:32.333
I REALLY THOUGHT
HE'D COME.

36:32.834 --> 36:35.625
COME ON.

36:46.083 --> 36:50.667
I LEFT THE KEYS
TO YOUR BOAT
IN YOUR DRAWER.

36:50.667 --> 36:51.208
THANK YOU.

36:51.208 --> 36:52.708
NO, THANK YOU.

36:52.708 --> 36:54.417
MY WIFE HAD
A FANTASTIC TIME.

36:56.875 --> 36:59.250
I'M GLAD.

37:03.834 --> 37:06.708
[DOOR OPENS]

37:06.708 --> 37:08.834
I DID IT.
I'M OFFICIALLY
A BROTHER!

WHOO!

37:10.917 --> 37:13.375

YOU OFFICIALLY SUCK.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.333

37:15.333 --> 37:18.250
I GOTTA GO--
I GOTTA GO CHANGE.

37:18.250 --> 37:21.959
YOU BROKE HIS HEART.

37:21.959 --> 37:23.166
DO YOU CARE?
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEEM

37:23.166 --> 37:26.166
TOO BENT OUT OF SHAPE
ABOUT IT.

37:26.166 --> 37:29.125
JEN, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

37:29.125 --> 37:32.291
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE A SECOND

37:32.291 --> 37:34.375
AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU GAVE UP TODAY.

37:34.375 --> 37:38.750
YOU--YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I KNOW?

37:38.750 --> 37:40.750
I HAVE NO IDEA.

37:40.750 --> 37:44.125
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN FEEL
LIKE I KNOW YOU ANYMORE.

37:44.125 --> 37:45.792
WE HAVEN'T REALLY
BEEN FRIENDS

37:45.792 --> 37:48.542
SINCE YOU GOT INVOLVED
WITH THIS--THIS FRAT.

37:48.542 --> 37:51.250
OR MAYBE SINCE YOU
STARTED SEEING CHARLIE.

37:51.250 --> 37:53.291
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

37:53.291 --> 37:54.458
WHY SHOULD I
BE FAIR, JEN?

37:54.458 --> 37:55.875
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FAIR
TO ME IN MONTHS.

37:55.875 --> 37:56.959
IS THIS ABOUT US?

37:56.959 --> 37:59.083
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WAS ABOUT YOU AND TOBEY.

37:59.083 --> 38:00.291
IT'S ALL THE SAME!

38:00.291 --> 38:03.417
LOOK, WE ARE ALL
GROWING APART, OK?

38:03.417 --> 38:06.375
SO MAYBE I WANTED
TO SPARE TOBEY
A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN.

38:06.375 --> 38:07.583
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:07.583 --> 38:09.333
IT MEANS I--

38:10.583 --> 38:14.500
I WANT TO--I WANT
TO MEET NEW PEOPLE, OK?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.959
I WANT TO HAVE
NEW EXPERIENCES,

AND I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT--

38:19.792 --> 38:22.708
ABOUT HURTING
SOMEBODY ELSE
IN THE PROCESS.

38:22.708 --> 38:24.083
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD HIM THAT.

NO. BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T
BE HAPPY.

39:50.125 --> 39:52.458
I MEAN, MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
JUST LEFT.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.792
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN ALMOST A MONTH,

39:53.792 --> 39:57.375
AND AS SOON AS HE
WALKED OUT OF THE DOOR
I FELT RELIEVED.

39:57.375 --> 39:59.625
HOW HORRIBLE IS THAT?

39:59.625 --> 40:02.875
IT'S NOT HORRIBLE.
THAT'S HONEST.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.917
WHY DO I FEEL SO GUILTY?

40:14.917 --> 40:17.583
YEAH...

40:17.583 --> 40:19.208
HE DIDN'T WANT
THE BOOK?

40:20.291 --> 40:22.625
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE HE FORGOT IT,

40:22.625 --> 40:24.083
OR MAYBE IT WAS HIS WAY
OF TELLING ME TO BUTT OUT,

40:24.083 --> 40:28.917
BUT, I MEAN, TRUTHFULLY,
I DIDN'T THINK THE BOOK
WOULD EVEN HELP.

40:28.917 --> 40:30.166
WHY'D YOU GET IT THEN?

40:30.166 --> 40:31.583
WELL, BECAUSE--

40:31.583 --> 40:34.458
BECAUSE I KNEW
THAT AS SOON AS I SAW HIM

40:34.458 --> 40:37.250
EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED
TO SAY TO HIM WOULD
GET TOTALLY FUMBLED

40:37.250 --> 40:38.875
AND I WOULD
FORGET THE WORDS,

40:38.875 --> 40:41.875
AND I WANTED HIM TO KNOW
HOW I FELT.

40:41.875 --> 40:44.333
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO WRITE AN E-MAIL
BECAUSE IT JUST--

40:44.333 --> 40:45.834
IT'S SO IMPERSONAL, AND...

40:45.834 --> 40:50.250
THE THOUGHT
OF WRITING A LETTER
JUST FELT WEIRD.

40:50.250 --> 40:51.417
NO. AGREED.

40:51.417 --> 40:55.208
ACTUAL LETTERS
HAVE A VERY GRANDMA...

40:55.208 --> 40:57.291
HOKEY...SLEEP AWAY CAMP
KINDA FEEL TO 'EM.

40:57.291 --> 41:02.583
RIGHT. SO, I GOT HIM
THIS BOOK, AND I WROTE
THIS INSCRIPTION,

41:02.583 --> 41:04.291
AND NOW HE'LL
NEVER READ IT.

41:04.291 --> 41:07.125
AND ALL HE'LL REMEMBER
FROM THIS WEEKEND IS
WHAT A BIG FREAK I WAS,

41:07.125 --> 41:09.458
AND ALL I'LL REMEMBER
IS HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW,

41:09.458 --> 41:13.125
WHICH IS JUST--
IS THOROUGHLY EXHAUSTED.

41:16.667 --> 41:19.458
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE SKIP THE JOG

41:19.458 --> 41:22.208
AND GO STRAIGHT
FOR THE ICED CAP
FRAPPY THING?

41:27.875 --> 41:28.291
I'LL CHANGE MY CLOTHES.

41:28.291 --> 41:30.959
OK.

41:30.959 --> 41:31.834
HEY, AUDREY...

41:34.375 --> 41:35.500
THANK YOU.

41:35.500 --> 41:39.250
HEY...
TRY THE GLITTER
LIPSTICK.

41:39.250 --> 41:42.667
IT'S REALLY FUN.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.834
OK.

41:55.834 --> 41:58.625
Joey: "DEAR DAWSON,

41:58.625 --> 42:01.500
"WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HAPPENS, YOU WANNA REACH OUT

42:01.500 --> 42:03.834
"AND GRAB THE PEOPLE
AROUND YOU, THE ONES
WHO MATTER THE MOST.

42:03.834 --> 42:06.000
"THE ONES YOU
TAKE FOR GRANTED
ALL THE TIME.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.125
"AND YOU WANT
TO TAKE THOSE PEOPLE

42:08.125 --> 42:09.959
"AND HOLD ONTO THEM
AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN,

42:09.959 --> 42:11.542
"TELL THEM HOW PRECIOUS
THEY ARE TO YOU,

42:11.542 --> 42:14.041
"HOW KNOWING THEM
MAKES YOUR LIFE BETTER

42:14.041 --> 42:16.125
"EVERY SINGLE DAY
THAT YOU'RE LIVING IT.

42:16.125 --> 42:18.500
"BECAUSE WHEN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENS,

42:18.500 --> 42:21.750
"YOU REALIZE HOW AWFUL
IT WOULD BE IF THEY
DIDN'T KNOW,

42:21.750 --> 42:25.291
"IF THEY WEREN'T AWARE
OF THE PROFOUND EFFECT
THEY'VE HAD ON YOUR LIFE.

42:25.291 --> 42:27.667
"SO, I WANT
TO TAKE THIS MOMENT

42:27.667 --> 42:30.875
"TO TELL YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU, DAWSON,
AND I'M HERE FOR YOU...

42:30.875 --> 42:36.000
"NOW, FOREVER,
AND EVERY DAY IN BETWEEN.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.500
LOVE, JOEY."
